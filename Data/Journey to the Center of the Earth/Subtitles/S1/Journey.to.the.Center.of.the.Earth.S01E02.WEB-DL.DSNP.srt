1
00:00:03,461 --> 00:00:05,088
That dream felt so real.

2
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:06,673
[Diego] Oh, wow.

3
00:00:07,757 --> 00:00:09,759
It wasn't a dream, Pedro. Get up.

4
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:13,346
[distant bellowing]

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:14,431
[Diego] Come over.

6
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:18,476
[dinosaurs squawking]

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,938
[Pedro panting, gasps]

8
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,356
Wow!

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,110
First, it was a cave and now this.
Incredible.

10
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,612
It's just like <i>The Verne Dimension</i>.

11
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,573
No. It's better.

12
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,368
[squawking continues]

13
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:38,163
[Diego] Wow. This is incredible.

14
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:41,583
[Violeta] Diego, how are we going to
find Grandma here?

15
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:46,671
[Diego] It can't find the magnetic north.

16
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:48,048
[Pedro] That's odd.

17
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,008
And there's no sun to help orient us.

18
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:53,011
-Can't we just go back?
-[barking]

19
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:54,512
[Violeta, echoing] Soup!

20
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:55,847
[Laura] Violeta!

21
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,308
Violeta, come back.

22
00:00:58,391 --> 00:00:59,851
[Violeta] Soup, slow down.

23
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:01,352
[Laura] Come back!

24
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:02,771
[Diego] What are you doing?

25
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:04,147
[Pompilio] I can already smell

26
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,983
the precious tungsten stones
in this dimension.

27
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:11,362
[echoing] I'm going to be a millionnaire.

28
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,989
[dinosaurs squawking]

29
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,367
My ancestor, Gaspard Nadar,
would be so proud of me.

30
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:23,416
See if you can find the twin volcanoes.

31
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,502
-[Claudio moans]
-According to Nadar's journal,

32
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:29,172
-they should be close.
-Uh-oh. [mechanical whirring]

33
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,342
We-- We're being watched, Pompilio.

34
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:35,261
-What? Who? Where?
-Ah! Ow. Ah.

35
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:39,599
Stop moving, Pompilio.
I can't focus if you don't stop.

36
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:41,768
-Just some bushes and rocks.
-[groans]

37
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:43,311
You are hallucinating.

38
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:45,105
[Claudio] Somebody's watching.

39
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:48,900
Ugh, it's hot. Are we there yet? [mumbles]

40
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:51,653
[mechanical noises]

41
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:57,700
[Soup barks]

42
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,161
Are you sure Soup is taking us to Pola?

43
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:03,081
Well, he seems pretty sure of himself.

44
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:05,792
Soup, wait! I can't walk as fast as you.

45
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:09,712
-[Diego] Let's keep moving.
-[pants]

46
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,756
Pedro. Pedro, what's wrong?

47
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,842
[breathes heavily]
It's difficult to breathe.

48
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,343
Yeah, it's hard for me too.

49
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:16,970
[device beeping]

50
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:21,933
The oximeter on my Clack's
indicating low pressure, but--

51
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:24,060
But what? [sighs]

52
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,813
It's as if we're 4,000 meters
above sea level.

53
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:28,398
[beeping continues]

54
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:32,152
But it's also indicating that we're
1,000 meters below sea level.

55
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:35,071
[exhales sharply] That makes no sense.

56
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:41,619
I'm gonna take another reading over there.
Try to catch your breath.

57
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,580
[Violeta] Be careful, big brother.

58
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,833
[Ana wheezes]

59
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:49,794
[sighs]

60
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:55,842
-[exhales sharply]
-[heavy footsteps approaching]

61
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:04,350
[Diego] Ru-- Run! [pants]

62
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,115
[panting]

63
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,909
[dinosaur squawks]

64
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,118
[distant bang]

65
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:27,498
I have no clue what's happening,
but I have trouble breathing.

66
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:30,043
Ah! Put me down. Let me take a look.

67
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:31,377
[in French] <i>Oui, oui, oui.</i>

68
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,130
[in English] Gently.
Come on. Parrot on board.

69
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:37,258
[Claudio] I'm like a porcelain doll.

70
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,469
-[Pompilio moans]
-All right. Hmm.

71
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,512
All right. Let me take a look.

72
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:45,225
-[exhales sharply]
-[Claudio] Mmm. [grunts]

73
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,311
-All right. Give me your finger.
-Huh?

74
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,022
So that I can measure your oxygen levels.

75
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:54,067
-[in French] <i>Oui, oui, oui, oui, oui.</i>
-[Claudio moans]

76
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,487
We need to update this system, yeah?
Something about this doesn't seem right.

77
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:01,199
You're at 81%.
I'm surprised you held on for so long.

78
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,493
There's barely any oxygen
in this dimension.

79
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,037
And you're telling me now?
Do you want to kill me?

80
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,082
How can you say that?
After everything I do for you.

81
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:13,628
Do you know what you and I are like?
We're like Geppetto and Pinocchio. Yeah.

82
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:16,214
Here, take my mask.

83
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,133
[screams]

84
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,551
[giggling] Kidding!

85
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,971
-Inhale.
-[inhales deeply]

86
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,890
-Exhale.
-[exhales]

87
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,394
-Good job, Pompi.
-[in French] <i>Merci.</i>

88
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:33,231
[in English] Uh, I'm shocked.

89
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,358
You were actually
able to shut up for a few seconds.

90
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,902
-Ah, shut up, [in French] <i>stupide</i>. [gasps]
-[grunts, screams]

91
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,779
[in English] The journal. Oh!

92
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,781
-[Claudio mutters]
-My journal! No!

93
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:45,159
Oh, it's right there.
Why'd you push it, stupid bird?

94
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,869
But you were about to hit me!

95
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,705
[groans] What are you waiting for?

96
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:52,125
Hmm?
I'm waiting for you to say the magic word.

97
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,710
Immediately! Go and fetch it.

98
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,379
I need to hear you say "please."

99
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,298
Claudio, get down there now.

100
00:04:58,798 --> 00:04:59,882
No.

101
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,175
[groans]

102
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,846
[Diego pants] Stop. Stop, stop.
[breathes heavily]

103
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:09,183
I think we're safe. [coughs]

104
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,144
-What's that?
-[Pedro] Huh?

105
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:13,896
-Does that look like a door to you?
-[Soup barks]

106
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,983
-No wait, Soup!
-Violeta, wait a second.

107
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,235
[Ana] Soup might be guiding us.

108
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,320
[exhales sharply]

109
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,990
I have a hunch that my grandma is here.

110
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:26,617
-Uh-huh.
-Come on. [pants]

111
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,537
[in French] <i>D'accord.</i>
<i>S'il vous plaît, hein?</i>

112
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,206
[in English] See? Was that so hard?

113
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:36,919
"Please" and "thank you" are words that
open the doors to the heart.

114
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,755
Who are you speaking to?

115
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,590
[screams]

116
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:41,674
Crazy bird.

117
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,509
[mechanical whirring]

118
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,553
-[Claudio grunts]
-[gasps]

119
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:48,556
My journal! [laughs]

120
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,600
[Claudio moans]

121
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:54,270
Pompilio, are you afraid of
mechanical spiders too?

122
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,814
I already told you,
spiders don't scare me at all.

123
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,900
Good,
because there's a ton of them incoming.

124
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:00,568
-Uh, what?
-[Claudio mutters]

125
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,195
[Pompilio] Oh, boy.

126
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:07,492
-[screams]
-[Claudio laughs]

127
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:08,785
Run away!

128
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:12,663
-Hey, Pompi. Why don't we fly instead?
-[whimpering]

129
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,540
Yeah, we could fly if--

130
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:17,168
Oh, the jet pack! I can fly.

131
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:20,088
-Uh-huh?
-[laughs] See you later, stupid spiders.

132
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,632
[mechanical spluttering]

133
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,217
Ah, Pompi…

134
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,720
I think the propellers are
back at the camp. Hmm.

135
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,014
What? [screams]

136
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:34,102
Wait, Pompilio. [laughs]
Here I come. [laughs]

137
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:38,314
[panting]

138
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,068
[door creaks]

139
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,778
What is this place?

140
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,670
[heavy footsteps]

141
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:01,754
Shh, shh.

142
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,925
Uh, Grandma?

143
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,136
[all scream]

144
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,393
[screaming continues]

145
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:17,478
-Diego?
-Huh?

146
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:19,564
Violeta?

147
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:20,648
Grandma?

148
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:21,858
-[Violeta] Grandma!
-[gasps]

149
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,402
Kiddos!

150
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:25,528
[Pedro whimpers]

151
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,904
What are you doing here?

152
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,990
How'd you find this place?

153
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,993
-Your medallion brought us here.
-[Pola gasps]

154
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:34,162
We were afraid something happened to you.

155
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:36,539
[Pedro] Pola… [whimpers]

156
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,040
-…who is that?
-[Pola] Calm down.

157
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,334
That's Hans.
He's the guardian of this place.

158
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,462
[distorted] <i>Welcome to my refuge.</i>

159
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:45,173
-[Laura] Wow. How did you do that?
-He didn't move his mouth!

160
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,924
-Did you see that?
-It must be telepathy.

161
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,926
<i>Something like that.</i>

162
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,970
Ah, Hans, these are my grandkids:

163
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:54,557
Violeta, Diego. Their friends:
Pedro, Ana and…

164
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,683
Laura.

165
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:58,853
<i>I saw them earlier.</i>
<i>They seemed lost and exhausted.</i>

166
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:01,022
<i>I wanted to give them this.</i>

167
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:03,399
[Pola] You need to use these masks
to breathe here, okay?

168
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,611
In this dimension,
the decompression is really fast

169
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,863
and the oxygen levels vary a lot.

170
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:11,032
<i>Yes, and that makes you very hungry.</i>

171
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:12,783
You're able to read bellies as well?

172
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,577
You're a genius, you know.

173
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,621
<i>Come over here and eat something.</i>

174
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,664
<i>You're going to need it.</i>

175
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,708
-[horn blares]
-[Martín grunts]

176
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,044
Your workday started two hours ago.

177
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:25,588
Uh, yeah, but I spent all night
deep cleaning the bathrooms--

178
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:26,797
[Andrea] No excuses.

179
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,550
Wake up your siblings.
They didn't show up for breakfast.

180
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:33,304
[grunting]

181
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:38,351
Wake up, muchachos.

182
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,061
Hey.

183
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:50,780
Diego?

184
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,329
What are you up to now?

185
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:02,917
-What is this place, Grandma?
-[gasps, laughs] So cool!

186
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,337
You could say that I'm
on an archaeological mission.

187
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:09,423
Where are you going? Let me come too.

188
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,175
Mmm, you need to rest first.

189
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,261
Tomorrow I'll take you too.

190
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,137
Do you promise?

191
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,222
Mmm.

192
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,810
-Deal. [laughs]
-[laughs]

193
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,104
[Mauro] <i>I'm sure they went</i>
<i>on that exclusive trip.</i>

194
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:26,399
No, I get that, but it's weird, right?

195
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:29,443
Why would they stuff their sleeping bags
with pillows to fool us?

196
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,487
-I don't know, but, uh…
-I know.

197
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,030
…Pompilio will explain everything.

198
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,324
-We need to get to the activities.
-[Martín] No way.

199
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,076
I have to look for my siblings.

200
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:40,663
No. Pompilio will contact us
and explain what happened. Mm-hmm?

201
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,124
Andrea, I have to find them.
I have to go right now.

202
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:45,001
And I'm in charge of you.

203
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,877
-If you go, you're fired.
-But--

204
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:50,506
Do you want
your community service certificate, hmm?

205
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:08,441
[Hans] <i>The conditions in this dimension</i>
<i>are draining for everyone.</i>

206
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,735
<i>You need to rest as well.</i>

207
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:16,324
<i>Don't worry. We will all be safe here.</i>

208
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,333
<i>Uh, tell me, Soup.</i>

209
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,585
<i>Do you like your new name?</i> [chuckles]

210
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:37,011
-[beeping]

211
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,763
[engine dies]

212
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,014
[sighs]

213
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,350
-[beeping continues]
-[groans]

214
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,521
Diego! What are you doing here?

215
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:50,483
You promised you wouldn't go without me.

216
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,485
[exhales sharply]

217
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,363
Well, get in the back
and put your seat belt on.

218
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:57,448
-[Diego gasps]
-We have no time. Hurry up.

219
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:18,177
Hold on tight, Diego!

220
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,887
[cheers]

221
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,431
[laughs]

222
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,016
How did you discover this place?

223
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,810
I didn't discover it.

224
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:31,774
It was discovered many years ago
by my great-great-great-grandfather.

225
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:35,903
He was an extraordinary visionary
of his time.

226
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,197
-Jules Verne.
-No!

227
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,990
Did you say Jules Verne?

228
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,243
-[Pola laughs]
-Jules Verne?

229
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:47,665
-Uh-huh.
-Jules Verne. [cheering]

230
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,542
The one and only!

231
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:53,421
Hold on tight, sweetie.
We're about to land.

232
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,840
-Yes. Oh. Yes, yes, yes.
-[Pola laughs]

233
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,091
Oh, look, look.

234
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:58,509
-Wow.
-[laughs]

235
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:00,302
[dinosaur squawking]

236
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,762
I can't believe it.

237
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:05,266
[Pola cheers, laughs]

238
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:11,105
-[Diego] Whoa! [cheers]
-[cheers]

239
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,618
[Diego sighs]

240
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,040
[sighs]

241
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,711
-All good back there?
-Perfect.

242
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,884
I can't wait to tell Ana and Pedro
that this is the Verne Dimension

243
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,261
-and that I'm his great-great--
-No, Diego.

244
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,514
You mustn't say anything.

245
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:49,101
Only our family can know
about the existence of this world

246
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,728
and that's how it's going to stay.

247
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:52,688
But they're my closest friends.

248
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,691
You know,
Jules Verne had a very close friend too.

249
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:59,320
And, like you, he wanted to share
his discovery with him.

250
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:01,030
Biggest mistake he ever made.

251
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,365
[Pola] <i>His best friend was Gaspard Nadar,</i>

252
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,951
<i>and he entered this dimension</i>
<i>with the intention to take</i>

253
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,662
<i>very, very valuable minerals</i>
<i>from the center of the earth.</i>

254
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,372
[Jules] You'll destroy it!

255
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,082
<i>Gaspard only cared about those minerals.</i>

256
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,877
<i>He never cared about the problem</i>
<i>he created when he took them.</i>

257
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,420
Gaspard! [whimpers]

258
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:20,758
Fortunately, Verne was able to restore
the balance of the two dimensions.

259
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:23,302
He decided only him and his descendants

260
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:26,263
could know that a place
like this exists in the world.

261
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,682
We've spent years
searching for that portal.

262
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:32,770
That's why your parents are regularly
at the South Pole to take measurements.

263
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,105
That's how we found this portal.

264
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,233
And so why Mom and Dad?

265
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:41,904
Well, because all the members of the
Verne family are guardians of the portals.

266
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:45,783
Every time there's an imbalance,
we have to fix it.

267
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,953
[scoffs] So, that's why we're here.

268
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,457
-So, what's happening?
-An alteration in the magnetic field.

269
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:57,503
-What do we have to do?
-[rumbling]

270
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,338
[exhales sharply] Just follow me.

271
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:03,926
[rumbling continues]

272
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:07,638
Look, as long as you do the activities
as planned, you'll be just fine.

273
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,431
-Yeah, I know. Yeah.
-Okay?

274
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,184
I'm pretty sure she hates me.

275
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,145
Can you blame her?

276
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,565
She was crying for weeks.

277
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,233
Yeah, but it wasn't my fault.

278
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:20,943
Remember the beaver?

279
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:24,321
[teenagers laughing]

280
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:28,492
[teen] Oh, poor thing. [laughs]

281
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:33,956
[sighs]

282
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,500
It was my friends, okay?

283
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,085
Well, my ex-friends.

284
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:41,046
They were the one's who pranked her.
I wasn't involved.

285
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,592
Yes, your friends, your house, your party.

286
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,053
I swear, okay?

287
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,723
It wasn't me.

288
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,100
I, um…

289
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,980
You know, I had a crush on Andrea. Yeah.

290
00:14:58,772 --> 00:14:59,773
Very much so.

291
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,651
You should explain this to her
and clear the air,

292
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,945
-especially since you now work together.
-She hates me.

293
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,697
And she won't even give me a chance.

294
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,490
Put yourself in her shoes, dude.

295
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:15,080
[objects rattle]

296
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:18,250
[rumbling]

297
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,794
Is that an earthquake?

298
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,593
It's over.

299
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,473
[exhales sharply]

300
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:36,977
[Pola] There it is.

301
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:40,439
Verne's machine should be located
just past these rock formations.

302
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,157
Don't look down. Just look forward.

303
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,827
The secret is to focus three feet
ahead of your next step.

304
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,538
[rumbling]

305
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,632
[pants] I'm afraid of heights.

306
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,343
Look at me, sweetie.

307
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:13,597
[exhales sharply] I'm a Verne.

308
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:18,602
I'm a Verne. I'm a Verne. I'm a Verne.
I'm a Verne. [grunts]

309
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:21,355
-[Pola laughs]
-[breathes heavily]

310
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:23,148
That was easy, right?

311
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,858
Oh, my.

312
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,235
[sighs, sniffs]

313
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,249
-Look.
-Wow.

314
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,920
[both laugh]

315
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,555
[sighs] You'll love it.

316
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,150
Wow.

317
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,444
Incredible.

318
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:12,448
Right? And this whole system of dynamos
and valves was designed and built by Verne

319
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,867
to maintain the earth's magnetic field.

320
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,704
And, according to this guide…

321
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,416
we have to shift these levers in order.

322
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,043
This is the first one.

323
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:25,919
[Diego] Um.

324
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,129
[Pola] Yes.

325
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,506
All right, now the next one. [grunts]

326
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,175
[Diego] And now I think it's this one.

327
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:32,342
Wait a sec.

328
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:35,095
How do I do this? Please, let me do it.
Please, let me do it.

329
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,556
No, no, no. I have to do this, Diego.

330
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,603
-Ah! Oh.
-[siren blares]

331
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,313
Now what are we supposed to do?

332
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:54,031
[siren continues]

333
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,793
What about this?
This can replace the lever.

334
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:08,003
Good idea. Come on.

335
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:10,589
[Diego grunts]

336
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:18,931
[groans] Great. [laughs]

337
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:20,766
This is the last one.

338
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:26,271
[straining] Come on. Help me.

339
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,065
[Diego strains]

340
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,442
[sighs] Now what?

341
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,862
-My jacket.
-Great.

342
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,451
Perfect.

343
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,495
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

344
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:43,080
-[Diego grunts]
-[siren stops]

345
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:46,166
Ah. [breathes heavily]

346
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,128
-Oh, my.
-Did we do it?

347
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,921
Yes. [laughs]

348
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,841
Time to get back to our world,

349
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:59,429
erase the memories of your friends
and get out of here as soon as possible.

350
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,056
We're gonna erase their memories?

351
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,226
Of course. So, what happened
with Nadar doesn't happen again.

352
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,270
Remember, Diego…

353
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:12,025
the Verne family is the only one that can
know about the existence of this place.

354
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:17,072
Do you promise
that you'll keep this secret

355
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:20,284
and be one of the guardians
of the Verne Dimension?

356
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:34,256
[Mauro] Everyone excited to focus on
fishing today?

357
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,466
-Yes.
-Safety is of utmost importance.

358
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,094
-Where is Martín Medina?
-Uh, I don't know.

359
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,304
Late. Again.

360
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:43,557
It might just be me,
but you seem too interested in Martín.

361
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,766
[Andrea sighs]

362
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:49,104
[Martín] Hey, kids,
your favorite beaver is here! [cheers]

363
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,189
[Andrea huffs]

364
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:51,565
What are you doing?

365
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:54,568
I'm asking for forgiveness.

366
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:58,488
So,
how do you like the beaver costume, huh?

367
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:03,076
You really have crossed the line.
Don't show your face to me again.

368
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,162
-That wasn't the idea.
-You're fired.

369
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:09,499
Okay, but before you go-- [grunts]

370
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,585
-[kids laugh]
-Andrea, why was he apologizing to you?

371
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,128
-Andrea!
-What are you doing?

372
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:18,217
[Ana] Where'd you go? Why didn't you wait?

373
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:23,222
<i>I hope everything went well.</i>

374
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,850
-Where were you?
-Mmm. We went out for a walk.

375
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,646
-[Violeta laughs]
-[sighs] Yeah, we went for a walk.

376
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,398
All right, time to go back home.

377
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,733
-No.
-No. Why?

378
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:36,109
Yes, let's go home.

379
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,695
[explosion, rumbling]

380
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,030
That was big.

381
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:41,949
Volcano.

382
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:45,953
[explosion continues]

383
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,038
Those are weird volcanoes.

384
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:51,708
[Pola] The volcanoes of the Apocalypse.

385
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:06,139
JOURNEY TO THE CENTER
OF THE EARTH
