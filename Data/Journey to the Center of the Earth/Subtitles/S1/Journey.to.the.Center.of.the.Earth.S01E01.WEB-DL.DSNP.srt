<i>traveled to the depths of the sea</i>
<i>and went to the center of the Earth.</i>

4
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:22,981
<i>Everything I wrote, I lived,</i>
<i>was not in our world,</i>

00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:34,367

00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:42,417

<i>Therefore, dear children, grandchildren,</i>

11

12
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:54,012

all the time.

-Come on, guys.
-Ugh, really?

67
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,524

Look, when we get to camp
tomorrow morning, do me a favor.

78

Just act like you don't know me at all.
You got it?

79

Okay.

Yeah! I love puppies.

[child 1]
Phew, Lampisben almost caught us.

85
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,485
There was a glaring mistake in the game.

86
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:40,488
Verne wrote about dinosaurs,
not two-headed dragons.

87
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:45,910
Well, anyway, for the next time,
we will be well-prepared.

88

Grandma. Grandma. My idiot brother
used this thing to break a window.

102
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,562
-It's not a thing, it's a Clack.
-Clack?

103
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,606
-Just give it back.
-No, you're not getting it.

104
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,358
Give it back, Martín.

105
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,069
Your brother's an inventor too.
And you have to respect that.

106
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:05,114
Do you remember when you tried to invent
those glasses with a camera?

107
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,908
Yeah, but those things actually worked.

108
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:09,035
Unlike this thing
that almost killed his friends.

I'm not a baby! [grunts]

113
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:20,797
All right, enough. Hey, hey!
No more fighting. Stop.

114
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,508
I'll help you calibrate your Clack later.

115
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,761
Why haven't you started packing
for summer camp yet?

116
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:28,513
Camp starts tomorrow, kiddos.

117
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,932
Everybody has more important things to do.

118
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:34,102
My parents have their research
on the other side of the world,

119
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:36,854
you have your explorations,
Martín has his own things.

120

-Hmm.
-I get it.

121

Are you seeing that, Julia?

132
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:42,378
The Earth's magnetic field is fluctuating
rapidly, and that worries me.

<i>I'm going to try to go in today.</i>

134
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:48,009

have to check the measurements

-of the magnetic field.
-<i>You're going in today?</i>

136

<i>What are you gonna do with the kids, Mom?</i>
<i>You can't leave them alone.</i>

137
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,684
I'm not leaving them alone, Julia.

138
00:07:56,767 --> 00:08:01,105
Tomorrow they're going to the exploration
camp, and they're super excited.

139
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:04,066
They'll be safe there.
Martín will keep an eye on them.

You're right. [sighs]

141

[Diego] <i>I wanna go with you.</i>

144
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,826
I'm a good explorer.
I'll be helpful there.

145
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:18,039
I know. But you'll be exploring at camp
with other kids.

146
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,624
-That doesn't count.
-[groans]

147

You're leaving us?

150

Mm-hmm. I am, Martín.

151
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,218
I'm leaving you in charge, okay?

152
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,802
Be sure to take care of them.

162
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,298
-Yeah.
-On your shoulder there's a black widow.

163
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:53,676
Whatever you say.
This piece of junk isn't a black widow.

164
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:54,969
No, your other shoulder.

-Where? [gasps, shouts]
-[laughing]

Oh, no. She ran away.

00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:23,998
No, no, no, no! I've been
trying to enter this portal for years.

174
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,334
It's all your fault, Pompilio.

175
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:29,170
-If you weren't afraid--
-I'm not afraid. I was merely startled.

176
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:30,254
[chuckles] Yeah.

177
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:34,592

-Yeah?

I brought a special light

They'll be super lit now, am I right?

268

Hey. Why are they carrying your things
and not mine?

272
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,787
Hmm, I don't know. Let me think.

273
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,999
Oh, I know. Because I'm an influencer,
Pompilio's nephew,

274
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:36,876
and last but not least, I'm Calderón.

275
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,004
And you? Let me guess.
Just another face in the crowd.

276
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,714
But here, you may have this--

277
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,883
I'm not just another face in the crowd.

278
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:44,967

292
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,128
Just my luck running into you here,
of all places.

293
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:23,172
There's something different about you,
yeah?

294
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,924
Yes, I know, I've changed.

295
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,926
I'm not the Andrea that you once knew.

296
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:30,262
What are you doing up there?
You should get back to work.

297
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,432
Mauro was showing me the ropes.
And I just… [chuckle] …tangled.

298
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:36,268
Yeah. Sure. You're still as immature
as you always were.

299
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,603
Mauro, get him down, will you?

300
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:39,563
You helped him get up there
in the first place.

301
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,649
Get down for the presentation.
Chop, chop, chop.

302
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:44,360
-[Martín] Help me, man.
-Okay. Hold on. Just hold on.

303
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,612
-[groans]
-Right there. Almost. Perfect.

304
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,908

the best camp of our lives.

00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,326
[Violeta] Yeah!

306
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:54,370
Yeah, but where is it?

307
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:56,497
It's over there!

308
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,832

00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,853
Wow. I didn't know the camp is
allowing preschoolers in now. [chuckles]

315

[Antonio's friend]
Ooh, a little preschooler.

316
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,440
Uh-oh. This might be troublesome.

317
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:25,734
-[Laura] Give me my putty, please.
-Leave her alone.

318
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,236
-Why should I?
-Give it back.

319
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,321
-Give the putty back to her.
-You stay out of this.

320
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,573
And why should I listen to you, huh?

321
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,867
Because you can beg your daddy
and buy your own.

322
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:34,994

[Antonio grunts]

324
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:38,038
Antonio, don't fight, don't fight.

325
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,791
You just act tough
because you're a little older.

326
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,918
[laughs] Guys.
Here's a bunch of preschoolers.

327
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,713
[older kid] Let's go, Antonio.
Ceremony's about to start.

328
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,464
Do not embarrass us.

329
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:48,966
We're Calderóns.

330
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,553
Go. Give it back.

331
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,016
Saved by the bell.

332
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,977
But you won't be as lucky next time.

333
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,562
[Antonio's friend] Losers.

334
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,397
You guys are the real losers!

335
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,442
[Diego sighs]

336
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,195
Here.

337
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,156
Thank you.

338
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,825
[Diego] Don't stray too far.

339
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:17,870
-Let's go.
-Yeah.

340
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:19,204
Come on.

341
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,081
-[Violeta] Quickly.
-[Ana, Laura giggle]

342
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,959
-[children cheering]
-[Violeta] Yay!

343
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:28,422
[children chanting]
Pompilio! Pompilio! Pompilio!

344
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:30,340
-Thank you.
-It's an honor, sir.

345
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:31,800
I know. I know.

346
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,385
Go, go, go, go.

347
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,056
[Violeta] Yay, it's Pompilio! Yay!

348
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,515
[children cheer, applaud]

349
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,852
Are you guys ready for an adventure?

350
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:42,978
[children] Yeah!

351
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,980
Are you ready to have some fun?

352
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,483
-[children] Yeah!
-[Mauro] Yeah! [chuckles]

353
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,152
-Are any of you afraid?
-[children] No!

354
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:51,945
Superb!

355
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:55,657
Because here at the magnificent
nature camp of Pompilio Calderón,

356
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,494
you can look forward to
a month full of excitement!

357
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,038
-Tournaments!
-[in French] <i>Expéditions</i>!

358
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,831
-[in English] Tournaments!
-Bonfires!

359
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,208
-Tournaments!
-Extreme spo--

360
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:07,169
[in French] <i>Mais ce n'est pas possible.</i>
<i>La répétition, ça va?</i>

361
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,755
-[children laughing]
-[Pompilio] <i>Ça va bien? Bah vas-y.</i>

362
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,381
[in English] And remember…

363
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:12,674
[all laugh]

364
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:13,926
…only the bravest

365
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:18,055
will be able to come on
the most exclusive and <i>magnifique</i> trip.

366
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,973
-[child] Yeah!
-Who wants to go?

367
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,350
-[Violeta] Me!
-[children] Me!

368
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,977
-<i>Toi!</i>
-He's my uncle.

369
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,188
-<i>Et toi!</i>
-Wow.

370
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,481
<i>Et toi aussi!</i>

371
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:32,277
So, everybody, try your best
and listen to your counselors. Ah.

372
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,532
And the most important thing of all.

373
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:37,825
Ah.

374
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:39,993
The no-go zone.

375
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,496
Under no circumstance
can you enter this area.

376
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:45,290
And that's because this area is
super-duper dangerous.

377
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,000
[children murmur]

378
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,586
Because these lands belong to the dead,

379
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:55,217
anyone who trespasses has a <i>terrible</i>,
<i>terrible</i> curse at fate.

380
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,470
-[Claudio groans]
-And last, but not least,

381
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:03,517
I want to take the time to thank
our sponsors: the Calderón Foundation.

382
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,645
-[both] Hearts are ice cold!
-[older kid whoops]

383
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:11,942
Represented <i>ici</i> by my beloved nephews:
Felipe and Antonio Calderón.

384
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:17,322
A foundation dedicated to preserve the
Arctic mass melting in the north pole.

385
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,533
A big applause for them. <i>S'il vous plaît</i>.

386
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,743
[children applauding]

387
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,789
And now,

388
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:30,085
I declare the official inauguration
of the exploration camp

389
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,004
of Pompilio Calderón!

390
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:34,631
[laughing, cheering]

391
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,680
The challenge we have for you
will not be easy.

392
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:45,559
Each team will need to paint
one of these totem poles.

393
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:49,396
So prepare yourself,
because it needs to be impeccable.

394
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:52,149
-Not a drop of paint out of place.
-[child] Oh, no.

395
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:55,569
The team that finishes first
and has the best-looking totem

396
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,613
will win
points for the trip with Pompilio.

397
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,239
[children] Yeah! [cheering]

398
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,533
With the three of us,
this one's a piece of cake.

399
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,118
Ready, kiddos?

400
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,621
-[children] Yeah!
-[Andrea] Your time starts now.

401
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:23,847
Hey, guys,
I have a brilliant idea to help us win.

402
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:25,974
All right? Come on.

403
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,062
[Andrea] That's looking great.

404
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:34,900
Martín, could you keep an eye out on them?
I really need to take a--

405
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,026
What?

406
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:38,320
Could you keep an eye out?

407
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,405
-I need to go to the ladies room.
-Yeah, yeah.

408
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,490
-Yeah?
-[chuckles]

409
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,617
[engine starts]

410
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,244
[engine running]

411
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,999
Antonio, check out
what those losers are doing.

412
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,797
I can't lose to those preschoolers!

413
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:04,096
Oh, I have an idea.
Come here, come here. Faster.

414
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,641
[whispers]
The idea is the two of you will be…

415
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,772
I'm finally going to enter that portal.

416
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:18,277
Huh? First,
we have to find that stupid dog, Pompilio.

417
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:26,034
Are you going to humble yourself
and finally go look for that dog, Claudio?

418
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,412
I already told you my batteries are low.

419
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:30,622
-Besides, he went really far.
-Ugh.

420
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:34,293
Stop concocting fantasies.
You don't have to charge any batteries.

421
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,920
You only have one, and it lasts forever.

422
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:39,089
-Oh, are you serious?
-[Pompilio] <i>D'accord?</i>

423
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:41,925
-Ah, <i>d'accord</i>, <i>d'accord</i>.
-<i>Oui, oui, oui, oui, oui, oui, oui.</i>

424
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,595
[grumbles]

425
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:49,933
Gaspard Nadar.

426
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:53,562
Today is the day.

427
00:21:55,439 --> 00:22:00,027
Finally, one of your descendants
will make history again.

428
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:07,576
I'll finally get the precious tungsten.

429
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,329
-Yes! Give me a high five. [squawks]
-[groans]

430
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:11,872
Oh, sorry.

431
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,418
-[Pedro gasps] Wow.
-[Diego] Wow.

432
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,503
You're a really good artist.

433
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,797
-Thank you.
-[Antonio's friend 1] That's so cool.

434
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:22,716
Get the putty!

435
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,802
-Run, run!
-[Pedro] What are you doing?

436
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:28,472
-Give it back. Don't touch it.
-What's your problem?

437
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:30,932
This is getting old. Just leave us alone.

438
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:34,686
[Antonio's friend 1] Aw, look
at what the preschooler made. So cute.

439
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,064
-[Ana] Hey, stop.
-Leave us alone.

440
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,940
-Give it back.
-Make me.

441
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,568
[Antonio's friend 2]
It's really horrible. Did you make it?

442
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:44,321
-[Ana] Seriously, stop it.
-Is that's all you losers can do?

443
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:46,615
-You shut your mouth.
-[Antonio] Hey, calm down, okay?

444
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,742
Give her back her sculpture. Give it back.

445
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:51,036
Give it back.

446
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:54,122
Since you did such a good job,
we wanna film it.

447
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,874
Maybe we'll get some more views.

448
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,796
[Pedro] All right,
let's put on the finishing touches.

449
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:04,257
-[engine starter whirring]
-[Ana chuckles] Oh.

450
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:08,053
-[Ana] What happened?
-I don't know. It's not working.

451
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:10,597
-[whirring continues]
-Oh, Diego. Stop playing around.

452
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,266
-[whirring intensifies]
-[Diego] I'm not playing around.

453
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,730
[Ana] Please, just make it stop.

454
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:21,900
Kids, what are you up to?
What's going on here?

455
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:25,028
-Turn off the power.
-Diego, do something. Anything.

456
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,406
-Diego! Diego!
-[Andrea] What are you trying to do?

457
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:30,117
-[Laura] Turn it off! Turn it off!
-[Ana grunts]

458
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,079
[Pedro gasps, wheezes]

459
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,748
Martín!

460
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,876
I wanna pay those jerks back so bad.

461
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,545
I wanna steal their toothbrushes

462
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:44,381
and deep clean their toilets with it…
[chuckles]

463
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:46,883
…and then put them back for use.

464
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:50,595
Cleaning the bathrooms sounds more like
a punishment for us, no?

465
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,390
Right? Wait. The fire.

466
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:56,435
We wait till the fire goes out,

467
00:23:56,518 --> 00:24:00,272
then we grab the ashes
and put it in their sleeping bags.

468
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:01,857
-Hmm?
-Ah.

469
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,233
There's a rat!

470
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:07,028
-It's not a rat, it's my puppy.
-Is that your puppy really?

471
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,614
-Then tell me what's its name.
-His name is Soup.

472
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:12,242
[chuckles] Soup?
That's not a name of a puppy.

473
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:14,035
-Well, I guess it is now.
-[Soup whines]

474
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,746
-[Soup growls, barks]
-[gasps] Soup, come back!

475
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,039
No, Violeta, wait!

476
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:21,793
But-- Uh, guys. Wait, that's--
Whatever, let's go!

477
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:25,297
-[Soup barking]
-Soup!

478
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,507
-[Soup snorting]
-What are you doing?

479
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:29,551
[Violeta] Soup.

480
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,305
[Diego pants]

481
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:36,892
[Diego]
I don't think we're supposed to be here.

482
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:40,061
This is my grandma Pola's medallion.

483
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,564
But there could be many medallions
like this one.

484
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,024
No, this one is unique.

485
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:47,694
It belonged to
her great-great-grandfather.

486
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:51,239
She had it on her
when she left last night.

487
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:54,534
-So, that means that she--
-My grandma's somewhere around here.

488
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:58,747
I'm worried about her
since she lost the medallion.

489
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,290
-[Soup whining]
-[Diego sighs]

490
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:03,668
Guys, I need to find my grandma.

491
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,505
-She could be in danger.
-[Soup whining]

492
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:08,965
Can I count you in?

493
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,677
-[all] Yeah.
-[Violeta laughs]

494
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,138
Time to find her.

495
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:47,212
[Diego] Grandma Pola!

496
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:49,089
[Diego's voice echoes]

497
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:51,758
-Grandma!
-[voice echoes]

498
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,010
[Violeta] Grandma!

499
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:56,513
-[crow caws]
-[Pedro gasps, breathes shakily]

500
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,183
Stop messing around, Pedro.

501
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,143
This is serious.

502
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:05,772
We need to move now.
Before they find out we're not there.

503
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:07,357
Okay.

504
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,109
[Pedro sighs]

505
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:13,238
-That's my grandma's car!
-[Violeta gasps] She should be here then!

506
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:14,322
Grandma!

507
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,074
[Diego panting]

508
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:19,578
-[Pedro] Her car looks fine to me.
-[Diego] It wasn't forced open either.

509
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,204
I'm gonna try the black light.

510
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:25,792
-[switch clicks]
-[device beeping]

511
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:29,337
Look. Footprints. Should be my grandma's.

512
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,090
And they lead that way.

513
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:42,642
Hey, guys, isn't this the place
that Pompilio said is off-limits

514
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:45,437
and dangerous, extremely dangerous?

515
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,856
-[Soup barking]
-[Violeta] Soup!

516
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,275
-Soup!
-[Diego] Wait, Vio.

517
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:52,444
-[Soup barking]
-We have to keep going.

518
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:57,073
The footprints go in.
What if grandma's in danger?

519
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:58,908
Guys, we need to follow Soup.

520
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,119
Yeah.

521
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:03,663
This image…

522
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:07,959
What is it? I'm unable to get a clue.

523
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,169
[Soup barking]

524
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:11,921
[Claudio] It's the dog.

525
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:14,549
Along with some kids from the camp.

526
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:17,385
<i>Sacrebleu</i>. Those kids shouldn't be here.

527
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,389
-[Violeta] What should we do?
-[Diego] I don't know.

528
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:26,227
-[Violeta] Soup!
-[Soup whining]

529
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,604
[Violeta] Come.

530
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:29,272
[Soup whines]

531
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:32,233
[Violeta] Wait. Wait for me.

532
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,194
[Claudio gasps]

533
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,239
That kid has the medallion. [screeches]

534
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,077
[Ana] Diego?

535
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,162
Are you sure?

536
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:46,039
[Diego] Come on.

537
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:58,301
[Pedro] Hey, let's stop here.
It's really dark in there.

538
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:02,180
[Diego] We have to keep going
till we find my grandma.

539
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:04,182
-[rattling noise]
-Let's go.

540
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:07,727
[water dripping]

541
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,438
[Ana] We've come really far, Diego.

542
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,940
-[Soup barking]
-[Violeta] Soup!

543
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,985
[Diego] She's right. We came this far.

544
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,071
Come on.

545
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,783
-Grandma!
-[voice echoes]

546
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,619
Pola!

547
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:29,958
Come on, Laura.

548
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,042
[Laura grunts]

549
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:34,045
[Diego sighs]

550
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:37,257
[Violeta] Oh. The footprints end here.

551
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:38,925
[Diego groans]

552
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,346
-Pola!
-[voice echoes]

553
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,098
Pola!

554
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:48,476
Grandma, where are you?

555
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,145
I don't like this.

556
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:55,233
Don't you think there could be ghosts?
Mummies? Even werewolves?

557
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:56,818
-[person] Kids.
-A mummy!

558
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,153
[gasps]

559
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,488
-[Claudio laughs]
-<i>Pardon</i>? What did you say?

560
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,700
[Claudio laughs] They mistook you
for a mummy, Pompilio.

561
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:07,162
-Sorry, Pompilio. I didn't recognize you.
-[Pompilio] <i>C'est très bien.</i>

562
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,497
Why are you here, <i>petits garçons</i>?

563
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,332
This is an extremely perilous area.

564
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,334
Was that not clear the first time around?

565
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,753
Their grandma is missing.

566
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,381
Well, I'm known as the best explorer
in the world, you know?

567
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:21,468
If there's a person missing,
then I'll go find them.

568
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:26,264
But I'll need, uh… something of hers.

569
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:28,516
Some object,
something I can touch physically.

570
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,018
Do you have anything?

571
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,020
Her medallion!

572
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:35,273
Superb.

573
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,610
If grandma lost this medallion,
that means something's wrong.

574
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,362
May I examine it?

575
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,239
[robotic whirring]

576
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:49,412
<i>S'il vous plaît</i>?

577
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:55,919
-[electricity crackles]
-[Pompilio shouts]

578
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,922
-[Pompilio grunts]
-[Claudio grunts]

579
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:02,467
Hey, kid, what was that for?
It must have a thousand volts.

580
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,760
[Soup growling]

581
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:04,844
[Diego gasps]

582
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,473
-Shoo, get out of here.
-[Soup growls]

583
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:11,851
Don't worry, Pompilio's on our side.
He's our friend.

584
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:13,853
Well now, um…

585
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:16,147
I'll go look for your grandmother.

586
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:18,650
But all of you get back to camp now.

587
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:21,945
-<i>Allez, allez!</i>
-[Violeta] Look, a piece of cloth.

588
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:25,657
-[Diego] That's my grandma's handkerchief.
-[scoffs] That's not possible.

589
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,201
That wall's been there
for a thousand years.

590
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:30,620
[Diego] Look, her footprint.

591
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:33,373
My grandma must be in there. [grunts]

592
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:35,959
-[Claudio] Uh-oh. Oh, yeah, yeah.
-[Diego] Grandma! Grandma.

593
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:37,669
[Violeta] Open! [strains]

594
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:39,838
[Ana] I think this is a secret door.

595
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:42,048
[chuckles] What fanciful ideas,
<i>mademoiselle</i>.

596
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:44,592
Uh, it's-- it's merely a wall. A wall.

597
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:47,303
Come on, time to get back. <i>Allez</i>, <i>allez</i>.

598
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:50,390
Wait, Pompilio.
We can't take the medallion.

599
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:51,850
[Violeta grunts] Grandma!

600
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:55,645
Let them open the portal
and then we'll get rid of them.

601
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:56,896
[Claudio] Mm-hmm.

602
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,482
-I know what to do.
-[Claudio grunts]

603
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:03,570
We let them enter with the medallion,
then we can get rid of them later.

604
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:06,447
Oh, wow. You're--
You're a genius, Pompilio.

605
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,408
<i>Oui</i>, <i>oui</i>, <i>oui</i>. I know. I know.

606
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:12,370
[Claudio] Hey, look! Some symbols! Huh?

607
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:15,665
<i>Oh là là</i>. Look what we have here.

608
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:16,958
[Claudio] Huh?

609
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:20,628
[Claudio] Oh, oh.

610
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:24,799
[Diego]
It's the same symbol as the medallion.

611
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:28,261
Oh, I wonder what will happen
if we put it together.

612
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:30,346
Yeah. Maybe the the door will open.

613
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:33,975
What a brilliant idea.
How did you come up with that?

614
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:36,477
-Thanks. I saw it in a movie.
-[Pompilio] Mmm.

615
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,659
[portal whirring]

616
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,046
Come on. That must be where my grandma is.

617
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:04,547
Stop. Don't move, all right?

618
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:09,218
This could be a death trap.
This could be the gates of the Apocalypse.

619
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:11,971
-No, that's where my grandma--
-Silence, <i>mademoiselle</i>!

620
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:14,307
I am not about to allow you
to endanger yourselves.

621
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:17,310
Claudio and I will go search
for your grandmother.

622
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:20,396
-All of you will go back to the camp now.
-[Diego] No.

623
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,440
I'm going to save my grandma.

624
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:26,194
Then you leave me with no other option.

625
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,946
Looks like some force will be needed.

626
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,950
My favorite chemical agent.
It's infallible.

627
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,743
Claudio, show them.

628
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:36,496
[Claudio cackles, strains, farts]

629
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:39,499
[children groaning, retching, coughing]

630
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:42,126
[Ana] I can't breathe. [coughs]

631
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,837
[Claudio] Hey, coward, let go of me!
[screaming]

632
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:45,922
[Pompilio screaming]

633
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:47,298
[Claudio] Let go of me!

634
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:50,969
[Claudio] I don't have a passport!
Mommy! [cries]

635
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,178
[Laura] The portal!

636
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:54,973
It's closing up!

637
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,307
[Soup barking]

638
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:59,185
-[Violeta] Soup, wait for me.
-Wait, Violeta!

639
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:02,397
-[Violeta screams]
-[Diego] No!

640
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:10,530
JOURNEY TO THE CENTER
OF THE EARTH
