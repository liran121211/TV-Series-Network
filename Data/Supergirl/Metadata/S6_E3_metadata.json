It doesn't work. In the process Kara injures her leg. The noise of their distress brings in Kryptonian criminals who grab Zor-El, hoping to sacrifice him to the Phantoms. As they are ready to grab Kara, too, a woman shows up warning that Phantoms approach. It is a ruse to save Kara. The woman explains that she is Princess Nyxly, a depowered, fifth-dimensional imp. She knows Mr. Mxyzptlk and was sent to the Zone by her father who was afraid she would usurp some of his power. As they converse, Nyxly manages to re-spark her powers to the point where she can remove a wrist fetter and fix Kara's leg. They rescue Zor-El, who reveals that Alura Zor-El built the Phantom Zone. The three agree to look for a possible exit point from the Phantom Zone where Alura had attached it. Maybe Nyxly's magic will spring them out? Meanwhile, a Phantom who has escaped into the world transforms Silas into one of its own and sets out to convert more humans to Phantoms.
