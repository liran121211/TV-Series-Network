Reverend Cotton Mather drives devoted wife Anne to despair by claiming to prefer suicide to doing baron Marburg's bidding to acquiesce the congregation by sermon, but ends up hailing Little John's triumphal arrival as 'restorer'. Isaac looks into the horrid crushing of a tramp pimp, inspiring Hawthorne, who ordered John to train new militia recruits, to blackmail the new brothel mother for half the income, only to be subdued by literally filthy disease. While Mercy restrains John from bursting in, Mary attempts to win and fatally abuse John's filial confidence, but his demonic sentinel's mind parasite torture enables them to trap her.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "5467144", "rating": 7.5, "votes": 257, "number_of_episodes": 36}
