Isaac Walton is the shivering stakes of a battle of witchcraft. Loosing it heralds the end of Mary Sibley's reign of terror, despite resorting to free husband George from his internal toad curse. Control of the town is taken over, officially on state authority, by young baron Sebastian Marburg and his domineering mother, a countess, who warns Mary time is running out to do their diabolic duty to establish the reign of black magic and demonstrates her new authority, liberating the incompetent magistrate so as to fool the populace while calling for renewed 'witch-hunting' as her purge. Mercy Lewis dares not believe her luck when the countess promises both to restore her slightly body and exact unspeakably worse revenge on Mary, to which purpose a captured other witch's juices are mercilessly harvested.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "4533372", "rating": 7.7, "votes": 319, "number_of_episodes": 36}
