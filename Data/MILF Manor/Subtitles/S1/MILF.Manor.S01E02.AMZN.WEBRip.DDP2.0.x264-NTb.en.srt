1
00:00:01,482 --> 00:00:02,662
[April J] <i>I thought
I had my whole life planned.</i>

2
00:00:02,655 --> 00:00:04,095
<i>But now I'm here.</i>

3
00:00:04,103 --> 00:00:05,693
[cheering]

4
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:07,719
[April J] <i>I'm just open
to the adventure.</i>

5
00:00:07,724 --> 00:00:10,314
I'm open
to having a connection
with a younger man.

6
00:00:12,206 --> 00:00:15,026
[Ryan] <i>I love older women
that can keep up with me.</i>

7
00:00:15,034 --> 00:00:17,484
I'm looking for love.
I need a grown woman out here.

8
00:00:17,482 --> 00:00:19,902
[Kelle] <i>I have
a very young, free spirit.</i>

9
00:00:19,896 --> 00:00:23,856
And I connect
to younger men,
especially in the bedroom.

10
00:00:23,862 --> 00:00:26,452
[man] You are not
exactly on the show
you thought you were on.

11
00:00:26,448 --> 00:00:28,098
Hey!

12
00:00:28,103 --> 00:00:31,343
[woman] <i>You're about
to embark on a dating
experience like none other.</i>

13
00:00:31,344 --> 00:00:32,834
Err.

14
00:00:32,827 --> 00:00:34,717
[woman] Here we go.
Here we go.

15
00:00:36,413 --> 00:00:38,693
- What's going on?
- [Joey] Wait.
They're our moms.

16
00:00:38,689 --> 00:00:39,969
Holy [bleep].

17
00:00:39,965 --> 00:00:43,205
[April J] I'm gonna have
to see my son date
these moms.

18
00:00:43,206 --> 00:00:45,686
[Harrison] <i>I don't want
to see who my mom's
trying to flirt on.</i>

19
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:48,099
What did I get myself into?

20
00:00:48,103 --> 00:00:50,523
I'm not mad about my body.

21
00:00:51,482 --> 00:00:52,552
Sorry, ladies.

22
00:00:52,551 --> 00:00:54,481
I might be sleeping
with your son.

23
00:00:54,482 --> 00:00:58,002
[Charlene] <i>Kelle invested
a lot of time into her body,
her sex appeal.</i>

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,900
<i>And I know that
young men want that.</i>

25
00:00:59,896 --> 00:01:02,756
It's a little much like
this isn't a game show.

26
00:01:02,758 --> 00:01:03,998
Pola.

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,660
I get the fantasy
suite tonight.

28
00:01:05,655 --> 00:01:06,785
[Pola speaking]

29
00:01:06,793 --> 00:01:09,383
[Pola] Kelle is not
the type of girl for Jose.

30
00:01:09,379 --> 00:01:12,759
I'm 100% sure,
she's not gonna get
anywhere with Jose.

31
00:01:12,758 --> 00:01:13,898
Never.

32
00:01:13,896 --> 00:01:15,996
[Jimmy] You see his body
language, too. Look at it.

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,280
[Kelle] <i>Whether
she likes it or not.</i>

34
00:01:17,275 --> 00:01:19,685
I'm gonna do
whatever it takes
to take my man home.

35
00:01:19,689 --> 00:01:20,929
[Jimmy] We got
to watch out for her.

36
00:01:20,931 --> 00:01:22,381
- [Pola] It won't happen.
- But what if.

37
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:23,659
No, I can't.

38
00:01:23,655 --> 00:01:24,895
I like to win.

39
00:01:24,896 --> 00:01:26,276
[Pola] Oh, my God.

40
00:01:45,241 --> 00:01:47,621
[Kelle] <i>The sun is shining,
an amazing day.</i>

41
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,830
[Joey] And I just love
looking at the lady's bodies

42
00:01:49,827 --> 00:01:52,027
and I'm just getting
to know them.

43
00:01:52,034 --> 00:01:54,104
It's a good start
to the day.

44
00:01:55,551 --> 00:01:58,761
My mom does get
a lot of attention
from here up,

45
00:01:58,758 --> 00:02:02,618
mainly because
she never wears bras

46
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,830
and the girls are always
popping out.

47
00:02:04,827 --> 00:02:07,337
You know, the headlights
are always on, so.

48
00:02:07,344 --> 00:02:09,794
[Kelle] It didn't bother you
when you were a baby
sucking on 'em either.

49
00:02:09,793 --> 00:02:11,933
- So, let's keep it real.
- [Joey laughs]

50
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:13,241
'Cause I needed
the milk, Mom.

51
00:02:13,241 --> 00:02:14,341
I needed some energy.

52
00:02:14,344 --> 00:02:15,594
You were really thirsty.

53
00:02:15,586 --> 00:02:16,856
[both chuckles]

54
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:31,718
From the places you've been,
which is your favorite place?

55
00:02:31,724 --> 00:02:34,414
So far, I love Costa Rica.

56
00:02:34,413 --> 00:02:36,413
- Yeah?
- [Kelle] I've only gone once.

57
00:02:36,413 --> 00:02:39,103
And when I went,
I went with somebody

58
00:02:39,103 --> 00:02:41,693
that I didn't really know,
but I'm like a risk taker.

59
00:02:41,689 --> 00:02:43,409
- I'll just do it, you know.
- Okay.

60
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,623
[Kelle] I feel like
Jose is interested in me.

61
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,100
Maybe I'm gonna
take a little bit more.

62
00:02:47,103 --> 00:02:48,413
- Baby, take whatever you want.
- No.

63
00:02:48,413 --> 00:02:49,623
Okay, fine.

64
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,970
<i>But I feel like I need
to get him away from his mom.</i>

65
00:02:51,965 --> 00:02:53,405
She's great,
but she seems to be, like,

66
00:02:53,413 --> 00:02:55,523
showing up every time
I like, try and talk to him.

67
00:02:59,172 --> 00:03:01,312
I want to get a cup
for us for the drinks.

68
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,380
Do you want another one?

69
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:03,719
- I'll get one.
- All right.

70
00:03:03,724 --> 00:03:04,864
[Kelle speaking]

71
00:03:04,862 --> 00:03:06,522
- [Jose speaking]
- I need my drink.

72
00:03:06,517 --> 00:03:07,587
[Jose] Yes.

73
00:03:08,517 --> 00:03:09,857
- So, Pola.
- Yes.

74
00:03:09,862 --> 00:03:12,002
I'm taking your son
out on a date.

75
00:03:12,862 --> 00:03:14,482
- You are?
- Yeah, why not?

76
00:03:14,482 --> 00:03:15,662
I haven't told him yet.

77
00:03:15,655 --> 00:03:16,995
No?

78
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,210
I don't like to say
what I'm gonna say,

79
00:03:19,206 --> 00:03:24,166
but I really feel that
Kelle is, like, easy,
and I don't like that.

80
00:03:24,172 --> 00:03:28,002
I know for Jose
it's really important
to have values.

81
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,340
<i>So, I really don't believe
Kelle is the right girl
for Jose.</i>

82
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:34,523
When?

83
00:03:34,517 --> 00:03:36,687
[Kelle] I'm not telling you,
you'll interfere.

84
00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:38,969
I told your mom
I'm gonna take you out
on a date.

85
00:03:38,965 --> 00:03:40,585
[Jose] Okay.
Let's go.

86
00:03:40,586 --> 00:03:43,236
[Kelle] She wanted to know
when, I said she can't know
'cause she'll interfere.

87
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:45,521
[Jose]
She doesn't need to know.

88
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:47,757
Because right now
we're all in the same villa.

89
00:03:47,758 --> 00:03:51,788
It's gonna be a little bit
difficult to separate
my mom and myself

90
00:03:51,793 --> 00:03:54,003
<i>in regards of dating
other women.</i>

91
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,520
And so, I think
we have to get
a little bit creative.

92
00:03:58,689 --> 00:04:00,209
We're kicking
you out of your room, too.

93
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:01,476
[laughs]

94
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,310
[Pola] I don't see
Jose in a situation

95
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:08,790
where he's dating a girl
like Kelle.

96
00:04:08,793 --> 00:04:12,143
He always dates
very quiet girls.

97
00:04:12,137 --> 00:04:14,277
And I think
she's really wild.

98
00:04:14,275 --> 00:04:17,895
So, I don't see
Jose going far with her.

99
00:04:18,448 --> 00:04:19,928
Never.

100
00:04:19,931 --> 00:04:22,451
[Kelle] Maybe we can rock,
paper, scissors over it.

101
00:04:22,448 --> 00:04:23,998
- Thanks.
- [Jose] Yeah.

102
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,310
I think
Ryan is the most,
like, sexual like,

103
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,760
would be like,
know what to do.

104
00:04:32,241 --> 00:04:34,031
[Soyoung speaking]

105
00:04:34,034 --> 00:04:35,104
Exactly.

106
00:04:35,103 --> 00:04:36,663
I mean, I don't mind
chasing, but I don't...

107
00:04:36,655 --> 00:04:38,895
I feel like I have to,
like, test it damn myself.

108
00:04:38,896 --> 00:04:39,966
No, you can't.

109
00:04:39,965 --> 00:04:42,025
Really...
Why should we have to do that?

110
00:04:42,931 --> 00:04:44,381
[Soyoung speaking]

111
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,930
...because I have this list.

112
00:04:48,931 --> 00:04:52,901
Nobody fits in my list,
so nobody can keep up
with me, really.

113
00:04:52,896 --> 00:04:56,236
You're still sitting there
waiting like nothing's
ever come, so.

114
00:04:56,241 --> 00:04:57,691
You don't know
what you want, yeah?

115
00:04:57,689 --> 00:04:59,169
I do know...

116
00:04:59,172 --> 00:05:01,692
You might be closing
yourself off and nothing
can meet those standards.

117
00:05:01,689 --> 00:05:05,379
Well, that's why you have
to have a little standard
to get the right one.

118
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:06,829
- Yeah.
- If you don't have
that standard,

119
00:05:06,827 --> 00:05:08,617
how are you gonna
have what you want?

120
00:05:10,034 --> 00:05:14,144
I feel like my first initial
thing was like Jose's.

121
00:05:14,137 --> 00:05:15,617
- Probably the most.
- Yeah. Yes, yes.

122
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,030
[Soyoung speaking]

123
00:05:17,034 --> 00:05:18,974
[Charlene] <i>I think
Jose is hot.</i>

124
00:05:18,965 --> 00:05:22,135
<i>I already know
all of the moms here
love Jose.</i>

125
00:05:22,137 --> 00:05:23,687
<i>He's very intriguing.</i>

126
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:26,209
He definitely gives me
the impression that
he knows

127
00:05:26,206 --> 00:05:28,026
what to do with a woman
in the bedroom.

128
00:05:28,034 --> 00:05:29,664
He knows how to take control.

129
00:05:29,655 --> 00:05:32,785
He has that get
the job done mentality.

130
00:05:32,793 --> 00:05:34,283
Mm-hmm.
That's how I feel.

131
00:05:34,275 --> 00:05:35,615
Oh, my God.
We had the same.

132
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,690
Yeah.

133
00:05:36,689 --> 00:05:37,999
[laughs]

134
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:44,279
- That's a good spot.
- Mm-hmm.

135
00:05:44,275 --> 00:05:47,445
That's always a good
spot for every...

136
00:05:47,448 --> 00:05:48,618
[cell phone buzzing]

137
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,030
Oh, wait, guys.

138
00:05:50,034 --> 00:05:52,284
- I got a text.
- [man] You got to take it.

139
00:05:52,275 --> 00:05:53,335
[April W] I know.

140
00:05:53,344 --> 00:05:55,344
It's time to play
Wall of Secrets.

141
00:05:55,344 --> 00:05:58,454
If you can stump
your mom or son
with a secret

142
00:05:58,448 --> 00:06:01,168
that they don't know,
you win a romantic date.

143
00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:02,719
Oh.

144
00:06:02,724 --> 00:06:03,904
Oh, my God.

145
00:06:04,482 --> 00:06:05,792
Yeah. Yeah. Let's go.

146
00:06:05,793 --> 00:06:07,553
[April J] <i>Each week
we have a challenge</i>

147
00:06:07,551 --> 00:06:11,341
and this week
it's called Wall of Secrets.

148
00:06:11,344 --> 00:06:13,594
We're supposed to guess
our son's secret.

149
00:06:13,586 --> 00:06:15,756
The son is supposed
to guess our secret.

150
00:06:15,758 --> 00:06:18,788
<i>And if neither of us
guess each other's secret,</i>

151
00:06:18,793 --> 00:06:21,413
we win a date
with whoever we'd like.

152
00:06:23,068 --> 00:06:24,278
[April J speaking]

153
00:06:26,931 --> 00:06:28,071
[woman speaking]

154
00:06:28,068 --> 00:06:29,788
[April J speaking]

155
00:06:34,172 --> 00:06:38,072
[Joey] <i>So last night
we got a text that
we need to write down</i>

156
00:06:38,068 --> 00:06:42,068
some of our deepest,
darkest secrets that
no one knows about.

157
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:45,098
What we didn't know
is that we're gonna be

158
00:06:45,103 --> 00:06:47,523
revealing these
to the entire house.

159
00:06:48,689 --> 00:06:50,689
Ooh.
This is crazy.

160
00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:55,239
And not only that,
but the secret that
we're sharing,

161
00:06:55,241 --> 00:06:59,171
we got to guess
if it's yours, if it's mine.

162
00:06:59,172 --> 00:07:00,662
- [Kelle speaking]
- [man speaking]

163
00:07:00,655 --> 00:07:02,615
[Kelle speaking]

164
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,450
The whole point
is to stump each other.

165
00:07:05,448 --> 00:07:07,238
I think I got this.

166
00:07:07,241 --> 00:07:09,521
Or I'm gonna just go up
and I'm gonna say

167
00:07:09,517 --> 00:07:11,967
whichever is the craziest
one I'm picking.

168
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:14,995
I don't know,
you got April over there.

169
00:07:15,586 --> 00:07:16,896
Okay, here we go.

170
00:07:16,896 --> 00:07:18,546
- Wish me luck.
- Bye.

171
00:07:18,551 --> 00:07:20,551
[Kelle] Bye.

172
00:07:20,551 --> 00:07:22,071
She's so cute.

173
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,210
Oh, here I am
at the Wall of Secrets.

174
00:07:25,206 --> 00:07:26,716
Okay.

175
00:07:26,724 --> 00:07:32,144
So, I had sex in a mall
elevator after watching
a late night movie.

176
00:07:33,344 --> 00:07:35,764
That actually sounds
like it would be fun.

177
00:07:35,758 --> 00:07:38,688
This one is just horrendous.

178
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:40,899
I slept
with my son's best friend.

179
00:07:40,896 --> 00:07:42,616
That is just...

180
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,340
That's...

181
00:07:44,344 --> 00:07:45,834
That's unacceptable.

182
00:07:45,827 --> 00:07:47,967
I started dating
a couple of women,

183
00:07:47,965 --> 00:07:50,655
but they were both
just a hit and quit.

184
00:07:50,655 --> 00:07:53,515
I never called them again.

185
00:07:53,517 --> 00:07:58,687
That better not be Gabriel,
because I did not raise
my Gabriel like that.

186
00:07:58,689 --> 00:08:02,139
But I know
which one would be Gabriel.

187
00:08:03,586 --> 00:08:07,336
Possibly Gabriel has had
a seven woman orgy.

188
00:08:07,344 --> 00:08:12,074
Not proud of it,
but that could be
my kid right there.

189
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,860
Okay.

190
00:08:16,724 --> 00:08:18,664
This might be the walk
of shame here.

191
00:08:18,655 --> 00:08:22,025
I'd have to figure out
which one is Ryan's.

192
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:25,004
He knows who I date
and what my type is.

193
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,520
But you know things
about my sex life.

194
00:08:28,517 --> 00:08:30,137
- No.
- Yeah, I can do
without getting terms.

195
00:08:30,137 --> 00:08:31,517
I don't...
I don't share that with him.

196
00:08:31,517 --> 00:08:33,307
- I can do without
getting terms.
- I don't share that.

197
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:34,860
And I don't want to know his.

198
00:08:34,862 --> 00:08:37,692
I had a quicky on a yacht
with a girl I just met.

199
00:08:37,689 --> 00:08:39,339
Yeah.

200
00:08:39,344 --> 00:08:42,214
Yeah, that could
potentially be him.

201
00:08:42,206 --> 00:08:44,996
When I was 16,
I had a three-way
with two girls

202
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,100
at my mom's house.

203
00:08:46,103 --> 00:08:48,213
He better not have.
I hope that would not be him.

204
00:08:48,206 --> 00:08:49,896
I started dating
a couple of women

205
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:53,716
but they were both
just a hit and quit it,
and I never called them again.

206
00:08:54,586 --> 00:08:56,306
He probably had ghosted them.

207
00:08:57,551 --> 00:09:00,521
I grinded on a grandma
and she liked it.

208
00:09:00,517 --> 00:09:01,857
Hmm.

209
00:09:01,862 --> 00:09:03,932
It says really hard. Okay.

210
00:09:03,931 --> 00:09:06,281
I got pink eye
from [bleep] ass.

211
00:09:06,275 --> 00:09:07,445
What?

212
00:09:07,448 --> 00:09:10,548
[Billy] I got pink eye
[bleep] ass.

213
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:13,141
I don't think my mom
would do that.

214
00:09:13,137 --> 00:09:15,787
I got a pink eye
from [bleep] ass.

215
00:09:15,793 --> 00:09:18,453
You could catch a lot
of freaking pink eyes and...

216
00:09:19,206 --> 00:09:20,306
Hmm.

217
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,450
Salmonella.

218
00:09:21,448 --> 00:09:22,658
Salmonella?

219
00:09:22,655 --> 00:09:24,965
Yew.
Yeah, it's poop, you know.

220
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:27,095
Oh, that...
that's definitely not my son.

221
00:09:27,103 --> 00:09:28,933
If he got pink eye
from [bleep] ass.

222
00:09:28,931 --> 00:09:31,241
Oh, my God, mom.

223
00:09:31,241 --> 00:09:32,971
Oh.

224
00:09:32,965 --> 00:09:35,895
I can look back
at the doctor records,
just saying.

225
00:09:35,896 --> 00:09:38,206
We got a [bleep] group
of people here.

226
00:09:40,896 --> 00:09:43,896
I dated my son's middle
school teacher.

227
00:09:43,896 --> 00:09:47,276
I mean, I wouldn't know this,
but that could be my mom.

228
00:09:47,275 --> 00:09:49,135
I started dating
a couple of women,

229
00:09:49,137 --> 00:09:52,137
but they were both
just a hit and quit.

230
00:09:52,137 --> 00:09:53,307
I never called them again.

231
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,410
That's Jose.

232
00:09:55,413 --> 00:09:58,383
I've had sex
in public on a beach.

233
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:01,859
My mom goes to a lot
of nude beaches, so.

234
00:10:01,862 --> 00:10:05,792
I had sex in a restroom
with a stranger.

235
00:10:05,793 --> 00:10:07,793
He was young and very hot.

236
00:10:07,793 --> 00:10:09,833
That's giving Kelle vibes.

237
00:10:09,827 --> 00:10:14,307
I had sex in the mall
elevator after watching
a late night movie.

238
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,240
I think that might be my mom.

239
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,761
She's kind of kinky like that.

240
00:10:17,758 --> 00:10:20,828
I'm interested
in seeing what he picked.

241
00:10:20,827 --> 00:10:24,137
[Jimmy] I kissed
my male friend
for New Year's Eve,

242
00:10:24,137 --> 00:10:27,447
and that's when
he told me he was bisexual.

243
00:10:29,137 --> 00:10:30,547
Definitely could be my mom.

244
00:10:30,551 --> 00:10:33,211
I had a seven woman orgy.

245
00:10:33,206 --> 00:10:34,756
Are you kidding me?

246
00:10:35,448 --> 00:10:36,858
Could that be my mom?

247
00:10:36,862 --> 00:10:38,032
Oh, my. God.

248
00:10:38,034 --> 00:10:39,344
Oh, my God.

249
00:10:39,344 --> 00:10:40,454
What?

250
00:10:40,448 --> 00:10:43,068
Oh, my God.

251
00:10:43,068 --> 00:10:44,758
[Harrison speaking]

252
00:10:46,241 --> 00:10:48,281
[Charlene] I make
the most out
of my elevator experience,

253
00:10:48,275 --> 00:10:49,855
you know that since
you were kids.

254
00:10:49,862 --> 00:10:51,282
- Oh, I...
- We jump, it's a whole thing.

255
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,065
We jump.
It's too much information.

256
00:10:53,068 --> 00:10:55,138
I slept with my...

257
00:10:55,137 --> 00:10:59,027
Wait, I slept
with my son's best friend.

258
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:00,484
Wow.
Okay.

259
00:11:00,482 --> 00:11:03,832
I think April W slept
with her son's best friend.

260
00:11:05,241 --> 00:11:07,691
That's either
April W or April J.

261
00:11:07,689 --> 00:11:09,029
Mine's...
mine's bad.

262
00:11:09,034 --> 00:11:10,764
Mine's bad, too.

263
00:11:10,758 --> 00:11:12,378
Which one's my mother?

264
00:11:20,793 --> 00:11:22,483
I got a text, everyone.

265
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:23,902
Yay!

266
00:11:23,896 --> 00:11:26,546
[April J] Now that
you've all had a chance
to guess,

267
00:11:26,551 --> 00:11:29,341
it's time to reveal
who was able to stump
their mom

268
00:11:29,344 --> 00:11:32,624
or son with their deep,
dark secret.

269
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:35,310
Everyone needs to fess up.

270
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:36,480
Oh, my God.

271
00:11:36,482 --> 00:11:37,862
Seriously?

272
00:11:38,482 --> 00:11:40,552
[indistinct chatter]

273
00:11:40,551 --> 00:11:44,551
[Ryan] I think potentially
these secrets could cause
drama because

274
00:11:44,551 --> 00:11:47,831
I think a lot of people
will use these secrets

275
00:11:47,827 --> 00:11:49,617
as a moment
to judge character.

276
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,280
Oh, my gosh.

277
00:11:52,965 --> 00:11:55,925
I had a seven woman orgy.

278
00:11:55,931 --> 00:11:57,691
[cheering]

279
00:12:01,068 --> 00:12:02,758
[Pola speaking]

280
00:12:03,965 --> 00:12:05,715
Well, I don't know
what they're talking about.

281
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:07,484
You don't really like
the Spanish talk?

282
00:12:07,482 --> 00:12:08,592
No, I think it's rude.

283
00:12:08,586 --> 00:12:10,276
Honestly,
it's getting annoying.

284
00:12:10,275 --> 00:12:12,405
Are you guys done
speaking Spanish?

285
00:12:12,413 --> 00:12:14,593
She becomes like fire.

286
00:12:14,586 --> 00:12:16,306
You go speaking
when you're by yourself.

287
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:17,380
It's fine.

288
00:12:17,379 --> 00:12:18,519
Like...

289
00:12:18,517 --> 00:12:19,997
Oh, no.
I'm the bad one.

290
00:12:27,482 --> 00:12:30,832
[April J] It's time to reveal
who is able to stump
their mom or son

291
00:12:30,827 --> 00:12:33,517
with their deep, dark secret.

292
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,760
Oh, my God.

293
00:12:36,758 --> 00:12:37,828
Seriously?

294
00:12:37,827 --> 00:12:38,927
[laughs]

295
00:12:38,931 --> 00:12:40,311
[woman] No, I don't know.

296
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:42,970
[April J] I thought
I wouldn't have to say
which one was mine.

297
00:12:42,965 --> 00:12:47,965
And I feel very nervous
revealing my secret.

298
00:12:47,965 --> 00:12:51,685
I'm gonna start with my son,
Gabriel over here,

299
00:12:51,689 --> 00:12:53,719
and I hope it's not true, but...

300
00:12:54,689 --> 00:12:57,449
I had a seven woman orgy.

301
00:12:57,448 --> 00:12:58,858
Yes.

302
00:13:00,241 --> 00:13:01,721
- [Soyoung] Yes?

303
00:13:01,724 --> 00:13:02,864
- No?
- [Gabriel] No.

304
00:13:02,862 --> 00:13:04,592
They're always all over you.

305
00:13:04,586 --> 00:13:06,276
Like I would tell you guys.

306
00:13:06,275 --> 00:13:07,335
[Soyoung] No.

307
00:13:07,344 --> 00:13:08,484
Loser.

308
00:13:08,482 --> 00:13:09,692
[woman] No.

309
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:13,379
I guessed that my mom
[bleep] my middle school teacher.

310
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:14,549
[gasping]

311
00:13:16,448 --> 00:13:18,338
[Ryan] Why are you laughing?

312
00:13:18,344 --> 00:13:19,904
Was I right?

313
00:13:19,896 --> 00:13:21,336
I hope it's not true.

314
00:13:21,344 --> 00:13:22,454
No, you're wrong.

315
00:13:22,448 --> 00:13:23,898
Who would you think
that I would...

316
00:13:23,896 --> 00:13:25,206
[Gabriel] Oh.

317
00:13:25,206 --> 00:13:26,376
[indistinct chatter]

318
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:27,999
That wasn't hers.

319
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,070
I win.

320
00:13:29,068 --> 00:13:30,208
[woman] Yeah.

321
00:13:30,206 --> 00:13:31,716
[Gabriel] Oh.

322
00:13:32,137 --> 00:13:33,927
We won.

323
00:13:33,931 --> 00:13:35,341
So, we stumped each other.

324
00:13:35,344 --> 00:13:37,074
- But...
-'Cause we always win.

325
00:13:37,068 --> 00:13:40,028
But does that mean
you're gonna hear
what my secret is?

326
00:13:40,034 --> 00:13:41,104
Oh, no.

327
00:13:41,103 --> 00:13:42,793
I better.
I think this is...

328
00:13:42,793 --> 00:13:44,693
Now we got to tell
each other our secrets.

329
00:13:44,689 --> 00:13:47,069
No, I don't want
to tell you my secret.

330
00:13:47,068 --> 00:13:50,518
Please tell me
your secret's not
the one of sleeping

331
00:13:50,517 --> 00:13:52,587
with your son's best friend.

332
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:58,553
All right, April.

333
00:13:58,931 --> 00:14:00,071
Okay.

334
00:14:00,068 --> 00:14:02,278
Gabriel, do you want to...
cover your ears maybe?

335
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:07,335
So, I was making a lot,
and I went with my boyfriend

336
00:14:07,344 --> 00:14:09,624
to our friend's house,
and I...

337
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,310
I woke up
with his best friend.

338
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,410
That's not that bad.

339
00:14:13,413 --> 00:14:14,863
[indistinct chatter]

340
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,240
Mine was kind of lame.

341
00:14:17,241 --> 00:14:19,761
I was on New Year's once,
and I was surrounded by,

342
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:22,238
like, my best friend
and all his, like, sisters.

343
00:14:22,241 --> 00:14:24,971
And it's just like
[bleep] And I was like...

344
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:26,065
I was like [bleep]

345
00:14:26,068 --> 00:14:27,588
Like I've never kissed
a guy before.

346
00:14:27,586 --> 00:14:28,926
So, like,
we kissed for a second.

347
00:14:28,931 --> 00:14:31,411
I stopped,
and then he was like,
why did you stop?

348
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:33,103
And he loved it.

349
00:14:33,103 --> 00:14:36,593
And then ever since then,
I think that's how he kind
of realized maybe he like...

350
00:14:36,586 --> 00:14:37,926
likes everyone.

351
00:14:37,931 --> 00:14:39,931
So that was the bisexual.

352
00:14:39,931 --> 00:14:41,931
Oh.

353
00:14:41,931 --> 00:14:44,521
[Ryan] <i>I'll be honest,
though, you got to take
your hat off to that.</i>

354
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:48,067
If you can be enlightening
enough to tell somebody

355
00:14:48,068 --> 00:14:50,588
you made them
realize their sexuality

356
00:14:50,586 --> 00:14:54,096
<i>and like pretty much
give credit to yourself
in that,</i>

357
00:14:54,103 --> 00:14:56,623
like that's a hell
of a egotistical transition.

358
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,410
Like, that's...
that's crazy.

359
00:14:58,413 --> 00:15:01,383
I... I would say
he has a pretty healthy ego.

360
00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:02,719
Yeah.

361
00:15:02,724 --> 00:15:04,484
Help me, Jesus.

362
00:15:04,482 --> 00:15:05,972
Come on, Stephany.

363
00:15:05,965 --> 00:15:09,515
So, the one
I picked for Billy was...

364
00:15:09,517 --> 00:15:12,787
I've had sex in public
on the beach.

365
00:15:12,793 --> 00:15:14,343
Yeah.

366
00:15:14,344 --> 00:15:15,484
[cheering]

367
00:15:15,482 --> 00:15:17,662
[Stefany] He's always
at the beach.

368
00:15:17,655 --> 00:15:18,855
[man] He's always
at the beach?

369
00:15:18,862 --> 00:15:20,412
Always.

370
00:15:20,413 --> 00:15:24,143
[Kelle] Billy's secret was sex
on the beach is kind of
a little enticing

371
00:15:24,137 --> 00:15:26,167
since the beaches, right?

372
00:15:26,758 --> 00:15:28,658
[Joey] Enticing?

373
00:15:28,655 --> 00:15:29,715
Wha...

374
00:15:30,551 --> 00:15:32,661
Enticing.

375
00:15:32,655 --> 00:15:35,235
[Billy] The one
I had for my mom is

376
00:15:35,241 --> 00:15:38,761
I dated my son's
middle school teacher.

377
00:15:39,862 --> 00:15:41,722
- [Stefany] He got it.
- [all] Oh.

378
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:44,409
[Stefany] He got it.

379
00:15:44,413 --> 00:15:45,663
- [woman] They won.
- [Joey] Nope.

380
00:15:45,655 --> 00:15:46,965
We got it.

381
00:15:46,965 --> 00:15:49,025
[Kelle] They thought
they guessed it right
that they won.

382
00:15:49,034 --> 00:15:50,314
But it...
But it was the opposite.

383
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:52,140
And they actually lost.

384
00:15:52,482 --> 00:15:53,622
Charlene.

385
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,240
Okay, so it's my turn, guys.

386
00:15:55,241 --> 00:16:01,931
I guessed for Harrison
that he said I grinded
on a grandma and she liked it.

387
00:16:01,931 --> 00:16:03,621
[gasping]

388
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,790
[woman] Oh, my God.

389
00:16:04,793 --> 00:16:06,313
[cheering]

390
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:14,030
[Harrison] Back
when I was a dancer,
a male entertainer.

391
00:16:14,793 --> 00:16:16,243
Whoa.

392
00:16:22,655 --> 00:16:24,305
[Shannon]
That piqued my interest.

393
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,410
That's all I got to say.

394
00:16:25,413 --> 00:16:27,413
I was like I need a date
with Harrison.

395
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,965
<i>So, we know it's in him.</i>

396
00:16:30,965 --> 00:16:33,925
It's like, who's just
gonna pull it out of him
is the question.

397
00:16:33,931 --> 00:16:35,211
Well, he pulled it out.

398
00:16:35,793 --> 00:16:37,793
[laughs]

399
00:16:37,793 --> 00:16:41,213
The secret that I guessed
for my mom was that

400
00:16:41,206 --> 00:16:43,966
she kissed my male friend
for New Year's Eve

401
00:16:43,965 --> 00:16:46,135
and that's when he told me
he was bisexual.

402
00:16:46,793 --> 00:16:48,593
- [man] Whoa.
- No.

403
00:16:48,586 --> 00:16:50,756
See I said I hooked up
with the 23-year-old,

404
00:16:50,758 --> 00:16:52,618
and I might not have
remembered his name.

405
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,000
[Kelle] Oh.

406
00:16:56,758 --> 00:16:58,138
[Charlene] So did we win?
Like...

407
00:16:58,137 --> 00:16:59,547
[Harrison] No.
You guessed mine right.

408
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:00,761
Yeah.
I mean, come on.

409
00:17:00,758 --> 00:17:01,898
You were a dancer, right?

410
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:04,166
Well, actually,
the word is male entertainer.

411
00:17:04,172 --> 00:17:07,312
Well, stripper
or male entertainer.

412
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,690
Okay, next one.

413
00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:09,999
Kelle.

414
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,660
[indistinct chatter]

415
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,825
Oh, Joey.

416
00:17:13,827 --> 00:17:15,377
[Kelle] For Joey, I...

417
00:17:15,379 --> 00:17:19,689
I guessed I had sex
in a mall elevator after
watching a late night movie.

418
00:17:21,068 --> 00:17:24,378
No.

419
00:17:24,379 --> 00:17:26,619
Joey ain't that cool.

420
00:17:27,862 --> 00:17:29,522
Mine was the hit it
and quit it.

421
00:17:29,517 --> 00:17:34,277
I hit it and quit it
within the first couple
of days.

422
00:17:34,275 --> 00:17:38,205
Multiple girls
and I never talked
to them again.

423
00:17:38,206 --> 00:17:39,476
[gasping]

424
00:17:39,482 --> 00:17:41,522
Oh.

425
00:17:41,517 --> 00:17:44,827
[Joey] All right. The one that
I guessed for my mother was...

426
00:17:49,482 --> 00:17:53,002
I have had sex
in public on the beach.

427
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,520
- No.
- Really?

428
00:17:54,517 --> 00:17:56,967
- No, that wasn't...
- Really?

429
00:17:56,965 --> 00:18:02,655
[Kelle] Mine was I had sex
in a Michelin restaurant
in London with a stranger.

430
00:18:02,655 --> 00:18:03,895
- Oh.
- Oh, my God.

431
00:18:03,896 --> 00:18:06,586
So that's why
you've been going
to Europe for so long?

432
00:18:07,241 --> 00:18:08,521
[woman] I like her.

433
00:18:08,517 --> 00:18:09,617
- So...
- We stumped each other.

434
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,690
- ...I guess...
- So, we won.

435
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:11,759
I guess we won.

436
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:12,898
- We won.
- Yeah.

437
00:18:12,896 --> 00:18:14,406
We didn't lose.
We won.

438
00:18:14,413 --> 00:18:16,003
Well, who are you
taking on a date?

439
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,210
I don't know.

440
00:18:17,206 --> 00:18:18,586
[Stefany speaking]

441
00:18:21,689 --> 00:18:23,859
[Pola speaking]

442
00:18:23,862 --> 00:18:26,032
[Billy] I was, like,
actually pretty shocked

443
00:18:26,034 --> 00:18:28,284
when it came
to Kelle's secret.

444
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:30,995
I thought it would be
a little bit more exciting.

445
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,590
I actually thought that
it would definitely be

446
00:18:33,586 --> 00:18:36,406
the one that she slept
with her son's best friend.

447
00:18:36,413 --> 00:18:37,553
Really?

448
00:18:37,551 --> 00:18:40,341
I thought it might have
been the seven woman orgy.

449
00:18:43,172 --> 00:18:47,902
So, I guessed for Ryan
that he's dated
a couple of women,

450
00:18:47,896 --> 00:18:50,516
that he just hit it
and quit it and never
called them again.

451
00:18:50,517 --> 00:18:51,857
- [Kelle] Yay!
- Nope.

452
00:18:51,862 --> 00:18:53,552
No.
Just...

453
00:18:56,103 --> 00:19:00,833
[Ryan] I was involved
with seven women
in a one-time situation

454
00:19:00,827 --> 00:19:04,137
for a night for my birthday.

455
00:19:04,137 --> 00:19:07,587
I knew he was like
a man whore,
but not on that level.

456
00:19:07,586 --> 00:19:09,546
[cheering]

457
00:19:09,551 --> 00:19:11,001
And everybody was happy.

458
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,280
[Billy] I'm not gonna lie, Ryan.

459
00:19:12,275 --> 00:19:14,205
That's pretty dope.

460
00:19:14,206 --> 00:19:17,656
Pretty sure all the guys
in the room are pretty
jealous of you right now.

461
00:19:17,655 --> 00:19:18,925
Lord, help me.

462
00:19:18,931 --> 00:19:21,141
I need a beverage after that.

463
00:19:21,137 --> 00:19:22,997
Maybe grossed out.

464
00:19:23,931 --> 00:19:28,451
I would never guess
in 10,000 years.

465
00:19:28,448 --> 00:19:30,168
That's a lot of years.

466
00:19:30,172 --> 00:19:36,072
That's before Christ and some,
that you would have been
with seven women at one time.

467
00:19:36,448 --> 00:19:37,658
Never.

468
00:19:37,655 --> 00:19:39,305
Seven days in a week.
Yeah, seven doors.

469
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,830
No, no.

470
00:19:41,758 --> 00:19:42,828
All right.
Where you at?

471
00:19:42,827 --> 00:19:45,067
So pre your dad...

472
00:19:45,068 --> 00:19:48,408
pre your dad,
guy I was dating,

473
00:19:48,413 --> 00:19:52,313
went to the movies
and had a nice time
at the elevator.

474
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,070
[cheering]

475
00:19:57,206 --> 00:20:00,096
[Shannon] And I'm just
thankful that the pressure
of winning a challenge

476
00:20:00,103 --> 00:20:02,173
is now off of me.

477
00:20:02,172 --> 00:20:05,312
I can't unhear your escapades.

478
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,620
At least you didn't see.

479
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,790
Thank God.

480
00:20:10,172 --> 00:20:11,412
At least you didn't see.

481
00:20:11,413 --> 00:20:12,723
Whoosah.

482
00:20:12,724 --> 00:20:14,174
[Soyoung] All right, now I go.

483
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:16,242
[Jimmy] All right,
all right, all right.
All right.

484
00:20:16,241 --> 00:20:18,281
[Soyoung] Let me
pick up Jimmy's secret.

485
00:20:18,275 --> 00:20:19,615
Okay.

486
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,410
Oh, I got pink eye
from [bleep] ass.

487
00:20:24,965 --> 00:20:26,165
[Kelle] Yeah.

488
00:20:27,206 --> 00:20:28,966
Real, real, real.

489
00:20:28,965 --> 00:20:30,335
[Soyoung] Real.
Do it.

490
00:20:33,103 --> 00:20:34,143
[woman] I do it.

491
00:20:34,137 --> 00:20:35,787
It's a normal thing.

492
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,520
[Ryan] What?

493
00:20:38,137 --> 00:20:39,477
Not the pink eye part.

494
00:20:39,482 --> 00:20:42,662
That just happens 'cause
when you're going up
and down,

495
00:20:42,655 --> 00:20:44,065
up and down,
back and forth.

496
00:20:44,068 --> 00:20:46,788
[laughs]

497
00:20:46,793 --> 00:20:50,793
[Pola] When Jimmy
starts talking to us
about what he did, I...

498
00:20:50,793 --> 00:20:55,003
I was like thinking about
what he was doing
and how he was doing it.

499
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,620
So, it was a little bit
complicated just to take
him out of the picture

500
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,590
and just see Jimmy as Jimmy.

501
00:21:02,551 --> 00:21:05,341
But I'm glad
he didn't kiss me in our date.

502
00:21:05,862 --> 00:21:06,972
After what...

503
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:08,685
what I heard
about Jimmy doing.

504
00:21:08,689 --> 00:21:10,069
No.
No way.

505
00:21:10,482 --> 00:21:11,722
[laughs]

506
00:21:12,103 --> 00:21:13,343
Oh, my God.

507
00:21:13,344 --> 00:21:15,004
The commotion in this room.

508
00:21:15,827 --> 00:21:16,897
All right, all right.

509
00:21:16,896 --> 00:21:18,826
This is what I guessed
for my mom.

510
00:21:18,827 --> 00:21:20,857
- I guessed...
- I don't know
if you could guess, though.

511
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:23,342
I kissed my male friend
New Year's Eve,

512
00:21:23,344 --> 00:21:25,314
and that's when he told me
he was bisexual.

513
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,450
Nope.

514
00:21:26,448 --> 00:21:27,588
And...

515
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:29,826
[Ryan] Well,
we don't even know
our mom's crazy.

516
00:21:29,827 --> 00:21:31,137
You guys don't know your mom.

517
00:21:31,137 --> 00:21:32,967
- We don't know our mom.
- [Jimmy] All right.

518
00:21:32,965 --> 00:21:36,615
Amma.
Amma.

519
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,860
I don't want to explain.

520
00:21:37,862 --> 00:21:39,172
I'm just gonna answer.
How's that?

521
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:40,312
Explain.

522
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:42,240
- [Soyoung] No.
- Explanation.

523
00:21:42,241 --> 00:21:43,721
No, I don't want
to explanation.

524
00:21:43,724 --> 00:21:45,904
Everybody explained.

525
00:21:45,896 --> 00:21:47,686
Well, start
and then we'll see.

526
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:54,170
[Soyoung] Okay.
My secret is I slept
with your best friend.

527
00:21:54,172 --> 00:21:55,592
Whoa.

528
00:22:10,068 --> 00:22:14,068
[Soyoung] Okay. My secret is
I slept with your best friend.

529
00:22:14,068 --> 00:22:15,858
Whoa.

530
00:22:17,517 --> 00:22:20,657
There's no way.

531
00:22:20,655 --> 00:22:21,785
Did you know that?

532
00:22:21,793 --> 00:22:22,863
No.

533
00:22:22,862 --> 00:22:24,552
Does it look like
I knew that.

534
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:26,381
This is something
I never saw coming.

535
00:22:26,379 --> 00:22:28,209
I did not expect this at all.

536
00:22:28,206 --> 00:22:29,376
0%.

537
00:22:29,379 --> 00:22:31,759
<i>And I thought
I knew my mom really well.</i>

538
00:22:31,758 --> 00:22:33,408
I don't know
what to think about it.

539
00:22:33,413 --> 00:22:36,413
Look, look,
I don't need an explanation.

540
00:22:36,413 --> 00:22:38,383
I'm a little traumatized
right now.

541
00:22:38,379 --> 00:22:39,719
I'm not gonna lie.

542
00:22:39,724 --> 00:22:41,524
We thought Ryan was a savage.

543
00:22:42,344 --> 00:22:44,144
Yeah.
Yeah.

544
00:22:44,137 --> 00:22:46,277
We're all in shock.

545
00:22:46,275 --> 00:22:50,025
[Kelle] Joey's best friends
kind of have been with him
since elementary school.

546
00:22:50,034 --> 00:22:52,414
That would be a boundary
I would never cross.

547
00:22:53,482 --> 00:22:54,972
[chuckles]

548
00:22:54,965 --> 00:22:57,205
[Jimmy] Why would
you put that down?

549
00:22:57,206 --> 00:22:58,406
I knew
you're not gonna get it.

550
00:22:58,413 --> 00:22:59,693
Okay.
So, say it.

551
00:22:59,689 --> 00:23:03,619
So, I put it down because
I thought,
you're not gonna get it.

552
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,930
You want me to...

553
00:23:05,482 --> 00:23:07,142
[Jimmy speaking]

554
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:08,447
[laughs]

555
00:23:09,896 --> 00:23:12,026
Soyoung likes them so young.

556
00:23:12,034 --> 00:23:13,594
Are we done?

557
00:23:13,586 --> 00:23:16,066
[Gabriel] That's the most
savage thing I think
anyone did.

558
00:23:16,068 --> 00:23:17,308
[Soyoung] Yes.

559
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:19,070
- [cell phone buzzing]
- [Ryan] It was so cold, though.

560
00:23:19,068 --> 00:23:22,588
The winners
of our Wall of Secrets
challenge are...

561
00:23:23,275 --> 00:23:24,545
<i>Ryan and Shannon,</i>

562
00:23:27,137 --> 00:23:28,547
<i>Kelle and Joey,</i>

563
00:23:31,241 --> 00:23:33,211
Gabriel and April.

564
00:23:33,206 --> 00:23:34,656
You are the three... Wait.

565
00:23:34,655 --> 00:23:37,375
You are the three
mother son duos
who stumped each other.

566
00:23:37,379 --> 00:23:40,899
And now for your prize,
Ryan, Joey and Gabriel.

567
00:23:40,896 --> 00:23:44,716
You won a group date
next week and will be
able to take whoever you want.

568
00:23:44,724 --> 00:23:46,244
[cheering]

569
00:23:46,241 --> 00:23:47,901
[Ryan speaking]

570
00:23:51,655 --> 00:23:55,275
I'm excited that
we have won something finally.

571
00:23:55,275 --> 00:23:57,135
Something.
Ooh.

572
00:23:57,137 --> 00:24:00,617
By way of us winning
and how we won, I'm horrified.

573
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,450
[Ryan speaking]

574
00:24:02,448 --> 00:24:04,448
- You see?
- We finally win something.

575
00:24:12,482 --> 00:24:14,902
Just finished
the Wall of Secrets.

576
00:24:15,862 --> 00:24:17,382
Damn.

577
00:24:17,379 --> 00:24:19,759
It's not what I thought
it would be like at all.

578
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:22,518
Honestly, this one hits deep.

579
00:24:22,517 --> 00:24:23,657
This one...

580
00:24:23,655 --> 00:24:25,475
This one I did not see
coming at all.

581
00:24:25,482 --> 00:24:26,932
Honestly.

582
00:24:26,931 --> 00:24:28,861
Hmm.
My mom...

583
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,210
she really dropped
one on me that.

584
00:24:33,206 --> 00:24:36,446
You know, it's just like
I don't even want to know
something like that.

585
00:24:36,448 --> 00:24:38,968
I feel like she should've took
that to her grave
or something.

586
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:42,339
I don't really know
what to feel.

587
00:24:42,344 --> 00:24:43,554
I don't know how I feel.

588
00:24:43,551 --> 00:24:46,341
I hope nobody
really talks about it.

589
00:24:46,344 --> 00:24:49,934
I don't want to know about
who it was with

590
00:24:49,931 --> 00:24:52,001
or even hear about it
anymore honestly.

591
00:24:52,827 --> 00:24:54,617
Right now [bleep].

592
00:24:56,517 --> 00:24:57,827
[Charlene speaking]

593
00:24:57,827 --> 00:24:59,207
[Jimmy speaking]

594
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,166
[Charlene speaking]

595
00:25:03,137 --> 00:25:04,967
[Charlene] I think
Jimmy's having a hard time

596
00:25:04,965 --> 00:25:07,895
because he wasn't ready
for his mom's secret,

597
00:25:07,896 --> 00:25:11,716
and I feel like Harrison
would be acting the same way.

598
00:25:11,724 --> 00:25:12,934
[Charlene speaking]

599
00:25:12,931 --> 00:25:14,691
[Jimmy speaking]

600
00:25:14,689 --> 00:25:16,689
[Charlene speaking]

601
00:25:16,689 --> 00:25:18,409
[Jimmy speaking]

602
00:25:23,137 --> 00:25:24,337
[Charlene speaking]

603
00:25:24,344 --> 00:25:26,244
- [Soyoung] Mia.
- [Jimmy] What?

604
00:25:26,241 --> 00:25:27,341
[Soyoung] Let's go to bed.

605
00:25:27,344 --> 00:25:28,624
[Jimmy] Amma.

606
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,590
Life's crazy.

607
00:25:30,586 --> 00:25:31,856
It's crazy.

608
00:25:33,068 --> 00:25:34,588
- [Charlene speaking]
- [Jimmy] No.

609
00:25:34,586 --> 00:25:36,026
[Soyoung speaking]

610
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,594
[Jimmy speaking]

611
00:25:42,931 --> 00:25:44,831
- [Soyoung speaking]
- [Jimmy] Yes.

612
00:25:44,827 --> 00:25:46,167
[Soyoung speaking]

613
00:25:46,172 --> 00:25:47,592
[Jimmy] No.
No.

614
00:25:47,586 --> 00:25:48,996
[Soyoung speaking]

615
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,410
[Jimmy speaking]

616
00:25:50,413 --> 00:25:52,003
[Jimmy] Um, honestly.

617
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,240
I'll listen to you.

618
00:25:54,103 --> 00:25:56,593
[Soyoung speaking]

619
00:25:56,586 --> 00:25:57,826
No, it's not about talk.

620
00:25:57,827 --> 00:26:00,237
Everything's understood.
Everything is.

621
00:26:00,241 --> 00:26:02,451
When I go in the room
we're not gonna talk.

622
00:26:02,448 --> 00:26:03,928
I understand.

623
00:26:03,931 --> 00:26:05,411
[Jimmy] Okay.
And it's okay.

624
00:26:05,413 --> 00:26:07,003
[Soyoung speaking]

625
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,790
Ah, it's not too far.

626
00:26:08,793 --> 00:26:10,453
You haven't seen too far.

627
00:26:10,448 --> 00:26:12,068
You don't live in my world.

628
00:26:12,068 --> 00:26:14,068
- You've never seen too far.
- [Soyoung] Okay. Okay.

629
00:26:14,068 --> 00:26:15,408
[Jimmy] Go home.

630
00:26:26,034 --> 00:26:27,484
[Jimmy speaking]

631
00:26:28,206 --> 00:26:29,756
Right?
Look.

632
00:26:31,689 --> 00:26:34,829
It gets...
it gets difficult in life, right?

633
00:26:36,827 --> 00:26:37,967
It's surreal.

634
00:26:37,965 --> 00:26:40,135
And you know what,
you want to run away.

635
00:26:42,586 --> 00:26:43,786
Hmm.

636
00:26:45,206 --> 00:26:47,856
I didn't expect
this at all, really.

637
00:26:50,586 --> 00:26:52,276
<i>I feel guilty.</i>

638
00:26:57,517 --> 00:26:59,307
But I'm a human.

639
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,660
I'm a woman, too.

640
00:27:00,655 --> 00:27:02,995
I mean, if...

641
00:27:05,241 --> 00:27:06,761
[Soyoung speaking]

642
00:27:08,931 --> 00:27:11,521
[Soyoung] <i>I'm hoping
he will forgive me.</i>

643
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:18,758
[sobbing]

644
00:27:25,862 --> 00:27:27,932
[Soyoung speaking]

645
00:27:27,931 --> 00:27:32,211
Either Pola is a helicopter
mom or a jealous wife.

646
00:27:32,206 --> 00:27:33,856
He likes what he likes.

647
00:27:33,862 --> 00:27:35,212
[Pola speaking]

648
00:27:35,206 --> 00:27:36,996
- Yes, he does.
- [Pola speaking]

649
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,550
I'm zero jealous.

650
00:27:38,551 --> 00:27:40,171
I'm really not jealous at all.

651
00:27:40,172 --> 00:27:41,722
[cheering]

652
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,140
I have a surprise for you.

653
00:27:53,896 --> 00:27:55,306
It is intriguing.

654
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,790
[Kelle] <i>Even though
we did not win this challenge,</i>

655
00:27:57,793 --> 00:28:00,413
I've gotten to arrange
a date for Jose and I.

656
00:28:00,413 --> 00:28:02,383
I feel like I need
to get him away
from his mom

657
00:28:02,379 --> 00:28:06,309
because she like seems to be,
like showing up every time
I like try and talk to him.

658
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:10,000
I know you're from Mexico,
so I planned, like,
a little date for us.

659
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,140
Okay.

660
00:28:11,137 --> 00:28:13,517
To show you one
of the landmarks of Mexico.

661
00:28:13,517 --> 00:28:14,787
Okay. Which... which is...

662
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:16,283
Can't tell you.
You're gonna see when we...

663
00:28:16,275 --> 00:28:17,375
Okay, I'm excited.

664
00:28:17,379 --> 00:28:18,969
Yeah.
And we're going by boat.

665
00:28:18,965 --> 00:28:20,545
Okay.
Amazing.

666
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,760
Thank you, <i>senorita</i> Kelle.

667
00:28:22,758 --> 00:28:24,278
It's fun.

668
00:28:24,275 --> 00:28:27,515
I'm not sure
what kind of surprise
she has for me,

669
00:28:27,517 --> 00:28:32,027
but I really liked that Kelle
took initiative to go
on a date.

670
00:28:32,034 --> 00:28:34,244
I found that quite sexy.

671
00:28:34,241 --> 00:28:37,661
<i>I think that my mom
would have some
reservations about her,</i>

672
00:28:37,655 --> 00:28:41,685
but I'm pretty sure my mom
would appreciate a woman
taking care of her son

673
00:28:41,689 --> 00:28:43,029
and being thoughtful.

674
00:28:44,034 --> 00:28:45,384
I got it.

675
00:28:48,655 --> 00:28:49,825
Look at the service.

676
00:28:49,827 --> 00:28:51,167
- Wow.
- Ah.

677
00:28:51,172 --> 00:28:52,622
Five star service.

678
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,000
Thank you. Hi.

679
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,620
- [man] How are you?
- [Kelle] Good. How are you?

680
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,550
Since Jose is from Mexico.

681
00:28:57,551 --> 00:29:00,481
<i>I want to take him
to one of the biggest
landmarks in Mexico,</i>

682
00:29:00,482 --> 00:29:02,072
<i>which is a mushroom rock.</i>

683
00:29:02,068 --> 00:29:06,548
<i>I've set up this date
because I'm hoping that
my efforts that</i>

684
00:29:06,551 --> 00:29:10,241
I'm putting into this date,
I hope he actually sees that
I'm really interested in him.

685
00:29:12,931 --> 00:29:15,001
So, this is the place
that you brought me?

686
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,760
- Yeah.
- This is the mushroom rock.

687
00:29:16,758 --> 00:29:18,548
- Yeah.
- I've seen that online.

688
00:29:18,551 --> 00:29:20,101
I...
I wanted to come here.

689
00:29:20,103 --> 00:29:21,933
- Do you love it?
- Yeah, I love it.

690
00:29:21,931 --> 00:29:23,861
Thank you. And I'm happy
to share this with you.

691
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:25,412
Like, I'm really,
really happy.

692
00:29:25,413 --> 00:29:29,173
Kelle has a very strong
personality, and that's
something that I admire.

693
00:29:29,172 --> 00:29:32,552
But also,
she has a very caring
loving side.

694
00:29:32,551 --> 00:29:35,031
I like that she's beautiful
and thoughtful.

695
00:29:35,034 --> 00:29:38,284
And I might want to see
more of that softer side.

696
00:29:40,241 --> 00:29:42,521
So, I want to talk
about things that...

697
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:45,380
that are amazing about you.

698
00:29:45,379 --> 00:29:46,519
- About me?
- Yeah.

699
00:29:46,517 --> 00:29:49,167
That caught my...
my attention a lot.

700
00:29:49,172 --> 00:29:51,832
Like the... the way that
you manage your space,

701
00:29:51,827 --> 00:29:53,927
how you shine
wherever you go,

702
00:29:53,931 --> 00:29:57,591
how you stick to your gut,
to yourself.

703
00:29:57,586 --> 00:30:00,546
So, it's very admirable.

704
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:02,621
- I'm glad you like it.
- For sure.

705
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:04,928
I actually...

706
00:30:08,275 --> 00:30:09,585
Um, I don't really know
what to say.

707
00:30:09,586 --> 00:30:11,926
You actually make me
a little bit speechless sometimes.

708
00:30:11,931 --> 00:30:13,071
- [Jose] Why?
- Which is rare...

709
00:30:13,068 --> 00:30:14,618
because I always
have a good comeback...

710
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,860
- [Jose] something to say?
- ...or something silly
or something funny to say.

711
00:30:16,862 --> 00:30:19,282
But, um, I don't know,
I'm just really drawn to you.

712
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:22,995
So, I feel like
I get a little bit of nervous
or something around you.

713
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,520
Which is weird.

714
00:30:24,517 --> 00:30:28,207
I'm glad that we do have
this time to get to know
each other better because,

715
00:30:28,206 --> 00:30:30,756
you know, I think
very highly of you.

716
00:30:30,758 --> 00:30:32,408
- Thank you. I appreciate it.
- Yeah.

717
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:36,073
And I adore your mom,
so I would love for her
to be my mother in law when...

718
00:30:37,413 --> 00:30:39,343
<i>I don't get hit on a lot
when I go out</i>

719
00:30:39,344 --> 00:30:41,144
<i>and I feel like a lot
of people tell me that</i>

720
00:30:41,137 --> 00:30:44,517
I'm a very intimidating person
which I feel it's so hard
for me

721
00:30:44,517 --> 00:30:45,857
to believe because I'm...

722
00:30:45,862 --> 00:30:48,622
I don't really feel like
I give off that persona.

723
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:51,760
But with Jose,
giving me a list
of amazing attributes of me.

724
00:30:51,758 --> 00:30:54,278
I'm not used to somebody
doing that,
especially on a first date.

725
00:30:54,275 --> 00:30:58,895
So, it was really exciting to,
you know, hear
how he felt about me.

726
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:01,860
Oh-oh.

727
00:31:05,517 --> 00:31:06,617
Knew that was coming.

728
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,280
The way you were
looking at me that whole time.

729
00:31:08,275 --> 00:31:09,475
- Yeah?
- [chuckles]

730
00:31:10,793 --> 00:31:13,453
Now I'm just like, whoo!

731
00:31:13,448 --> 00:31:16,618
<i>I feel like he was feeling
what I was feeling
at the same moment.</i>

732
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,410
<i>He left me wanting more.</i>

733
00:31:18,413 --> 00:31:20,143
<i>That's all I could say.</i>

734
00:31:20,137 --> 00:31:24,337
So far, being alone,
with us in the water
has been amazing.

735
00:31:24,344 --> 00:31:27,074
Being here and seeing
this beautiful sunset and...

736
00:31:27,068 --> 00:31:28,828
and how beautiful you look.

737
00:31:28,827 --> 00:31:31,407
This is a really special
moment as well.

738
00:31:51,758 --> 00:31:53,308
[Soyoung speaking]

739
00:31:54,689 --> 00:31:56,409
[Pola speaking]

740
00:31:56,413 --> 00:31:58,723
[Soyoung speaking]

741
00:31:58,724 --> 00:32:01,414
No, he's okay.
He's a man now.

742
00:32:01,413 --> 00:32:03,343
Yes.
He's a man.

743
00:32:03,344 --> 00:32:04,794
[Soyoung speaking]

744
00:32:04,793 --> 00:32:06,663
He's a man now.

745
00:32:06,655 --> 00:32:08,375
- [Pola laughs]
- He's a man now.

746
00:32:08,379 --> 00:32:09,969
[Soyoung speaking]

747
00:32:09,965 --> 00:32:11,825
Yeah, but he likes
what he likes.

748
00:32:11,827 --> 00:32:13,517
[Pola speaking]

749
00:32:13,517 --> 00:32:15,067
- Yes, he does.
- [Pola speaking]

750
00:32:15,068 --> 00:32:18,308
[Pola] It's really
important for me to have
a good man by my side.

751
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,760
So, I want the same
for Jose,

752
00:32:19,758 --> 00:32:22,898
I want him to find
a nice girl for him.

753
00:32:22,896 --> 00:32:24,166
Where's everybody?

754
00:32:26,758 --> 00:32:28,138
He been gone for 5 hours.

755
00:32:28,137 --> 00:32:29,517
He obviously like something.

756
00:32:29,517 --> 00:32:30,717
[Pola speaking]

757
00:32:30,724 --> 00:32:32,174
[laughs]

758
00:32:32,172 --> 00:32:33,662
[Kelle] Hola.

759
00:32:33,655 --> 00:32:35,335
[cheering]

760
00:32:35,344 --> 00:32:37,144
[Joey] Oh, you guys look good.

761
00:32:38,413 --> 00:32:39,523
[Pola speaking]

762
00:32:39,517 --> 00:32:40,997
[Joey] Spill the cheese.
Spill the cheese.

763
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,140
[Pola] Hola.

764
00:32:42,137 --> 00:32:43,237
[Jose] Spill the cheese?

765
00:32:43,241 --> 00:32:45,071
Yeah, you guys were
gone for a long time.

766
00:32:45,068 --> 00:32:46,168
[woman] Yes.

767
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:47,522
Any intimacy?

768
00:32:47,517 --> 00:32:49,067
- And...
- [Ricky] No?

769
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:51,214
[Ryan] Now throw
her the question.

770
00:32:51,206 --> 00:32:53,136
[man] You don't
kiss and tell,
what you're gonna do.

771
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,447
[Jose] <i>I don't even know
what to say.</i>

772
00:32:54,448 --> 00:32:55,928
My mom is there.

773
00:32:55,931 --> 00:32:59,861
I had... I had a great
time, but I don't know
how to express myself.

774
00:32:59,862 --> 00:33:03,552
Everything is blowing
my mind, honestly.

775
00:33:03,551 --> 00:33:05,381
Okay. Okay. Okay, listen.

776
00:33:05,379 --> 00:33:07,969
Since Jose is from Mexico,
I took him to like,

777
00:33:07,965 --> 00:33:10,205
one of the biggest
landmarks of Mexico.

778
00:33:10,206 --> 00:33:12,446
- [Jose] Yeah.
- And we had the most
amazing time.

779
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,898
[Ricky] What landmark is it?

780
00:33:13,896 --> 00:33:16,096
It's called the mushroom...
the mushroom rock.

781
00:33:16,103 --> 00:33:17,593
Ah, I wanted to go there.

782
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,790
We talked about it.

783
00:33:19,793 --> 00:33:21,243
- [Pola speaking]
- [Jose] Yeah.

784
00:33:21,241 --> 00:33:22,661
[Pola speaking]

785
00:33:22,655 --> 00:33:24,235
Maybe next time
you can take me.

786
00:33:24,241 --> 00:33:25,931
- No.
- Yeah.

787
00:33:25,931 --> 00:33:27,211
[Jose] Well,
we had a great time.

788
00:33:27,206 --> 00:33:28,546
It was really,
really amazing.

789
00:33:28,551 --> 00:33:30,141
Yeah.

790
00:33:30,137 --> 00:33:31,407
[Pola] It's fine.
I'm... I'm fine.

791
00:33:31,413 --> 00:33:32,553
I'm fine with it.

792
00:33:32,551 --> 00:33:33,791
I'm zero jealous.

793
00:33:33,793 --> 00:33:35,863
I'm really not jealous
at all.

794
00:33:35,862 --> 00:33:37,312
It was a boat for two?

795
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,860
Yeah.
It was a boat for us.

796
00:33:38,862 --> 00:33:41,342
So, you guys got
a hotel room or something?

797
00:33:41,344 --> 00:33:44,974
[Jose] A gentleman
never speaks about that
stuff with anybody else.

798
00:33:44,965 --> 00:33:46,305
That's why I love you.

799
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:50,340
[Kelle] Pretty sure Jose
is not on this retreat
to date his mama.

800
00:33:50,344 --> 00:33:51,454
Wham.

801
00:33:51,448 --> 00:33:52,788
We're jealous.

802
00:33:52,793 --> 00:33:57,283
Either Pola is a helicopter
mom or a jealous wife.

803
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,380
[laughs]

804
00:34:02,965 --> 00:34:05,165
[Stefany speaking]

805
00:34:05,172 --> 00:34:07,902
[Kelle] Okay.
No speaking in Spanish,
we don't know.

806
00:34:07,896 --> 00:34:09,856
The majority doesn't know
what you're saying.

807
00:34:09,862 --> 00:34:11,342
I don't know
what they're talking about,

808
00:34:11,344 --> 00:34:12,834
that they can't speak
in English.

809
00:34:12,827 --> 00:34:14,377
You're exploiting people.

810
00:34:14,379 --> 00:34:15,549
It what's you're doing.

811
00:34:15,551 --> 00:34:17,281
But it has nothing
to do with you.

812
00:34:17,275 --> 00:34:18,515
What is wrong with her?

813
00:34:18,517 --> 00:34:20,137
[Stefany speaking]

814
00:34:20,137 --> 00:34:21,277
[Kelle speaking]

815
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:27,790
[cheering]

816
00:34:29,413 --> 00:34:31,863
You really can't beat
tacos and tequila.

817
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:34,102
Is there a shrimp
taco somewhere?

818
00:34:34,103 --> 00:34:35,283
That's a beef.

819
00:34:35,275 --> 00:34:36,375
That's beef.

820
00:34:36,379 --> 00:34:37,999
It ain't nowhere.

821
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,380
[speaking spanish]

822
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:43,549
[Ryan] We finally get to see
the house let loose.

823
00:34:52,137 --> 00:34:57,277
[Joey] I didn't think
Soyoung would be so, you know,
active about her dance moves.

824
00:34:57,275 --> 00:34:59,515
I mean, she really
started going crazy.

825
00:34:59,517 --> 00:35:00,997
<i>It blew me away.</i>

826
00:35:01,758 --> 00:35:03,068
'Cause she's Soyoung.

827
00:35:03,068 --> 00:35:04,238
Yeah.

828
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:26,970
[Kelle] I think Mama Pola
forgot to cut
the umbilical cord

829
00:35:26,965 --> 00:35:28,065
when he was born.

830
00:35:28,068 --> 00:35:29,278
I feel like
it's uncomfortable,

831
00:35:29,275 --> 00:35:32,615
Jose to date me,
like with his mom right there.

832
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:35,720
<i>Clearly, there's some
sort of attachment disorder</i>

833
00:35:35,724 --> 00:35:37,624
going on between
Pola and Jose.

834
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,000
So, I'm like...

835
00:35:45,655 --> 00:35:46,855
Jose.

836
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,210
[Pola speaking]

837
00:35:49,206 --> 00:35:50,376
Okay.

838
00:35:50,379 --> 00:35:51,929
[Pola speaking]

839
00:35:52,413 --> 00:35:53,413
Pola.

840
00:35:54,793 --> 00:35:56,103
Go.

841
00:35:56,103 --> 00:35:59,103
<i>I'm frustrated with myself
for not knowing Spanish</i>

842
00:35:59,103 --> 00:36:02,723
because Jose and Pola
are speaking Spanish
very fluently

843
00:36:02,724 --> 00:36:04,414
'cause it's like their
first language.

844
00:36:05,896 --> 00:36:08,476
[Pola] I don't know
why she's staring at us
so much.

845
00:36:08,482 --> 00:36:09,592
- I don't know.
- Like... did I...

846
00:36:09,586 --> 00:36:11,476
did I any...
Did I do anything wrong?

847
00:36:11,482 --> 00:36:12,722
I mean,
you didn't do anything.

848
00:36:12,724 --> 00:36:14,554
- So, what... What's going on?
- I don't know. I don't know.

849
00:36:14,551 --> 00:36:16,211
[Pola speaking]

850
00:36:17,931 --> 00:36:19,001
They're...

851
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,070
Well, I don't know
what they're talking about.

852
00:36:21,068 --> 00:36:23,658
Maybe they're talking
about us, but it's like
I just...

853
00:36:23,655 --> 00:36:25,165
I just want to be
a part of whatever.

854
00:36:25,172 --> 00:36:26,832
Yeah. You want to...
you want to be in the know.

855
00:36:26,827 --> 00:36:28,337
[Stefany speaking]

856
00:36:28,344 --> 00:36:30,864
She would take my bed,
and then I'll sleep
on the couch.

857
00:36:30,862 --> 00:36:32,242
[Pola speaking]

858
00:36:34,206 --> 00:36:37,166
[Charlene] Pola and Stefany
and Jose are speaking Spanish.

859
00:36:37,172 --> 00:36:39,482
You know,
and their little group
is definitely making

860
00:36:39,482 --> 00:36:41,482
everybody feel uncomfortable.

861
00:36:41,482 --> 00:36:43,212
<i>For me, I want to know
what you're saying.</i>

862
00:36:43,206 --> 00:36:46,336
And if you don't want me
to know, then, like,
go somewhere else.

863
00:36:46,344 --> 00:36:49,074
[Kelle] Okay.
No speaking in Spanish,
we don't know.

864
00:36:49,068 --> 00:36:51,068
The majority doesn't know
what you're saying.

865
00:36:51,068 --> 00:36:52,658
[indistinct chatter]

866
00:36:52,655 --> 00:36:54,065
I spoke Spanish and English.

867
00:36:55,275 --> 00:36:56,755
I don't know.

868
00:36:57,896 --> 00:36:59,546
You don't really like
the Spanish stuff?

869
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:01,211
No, I think it's rude.

870
00:37:01,206 --> 00:37:02,786
I don't know
what they're saying.

871
00:37:02,793 --> 00:37:04,973
I think it's disrespectful, honestly.

872
00:37:05,827 --> 00:37:07,067
Are we speaking in German?

873
00:37:07,068 --> 00:37:08,308
Oh.

874
00:37:09,241 --> 00:37:11,031
[Stefany speaking]

875
00:37:11,827 --> 00:37:13,587
[Ricky speaking]

876
00:37:13,586 --> 00:37:14,966
[Kelle] Yeah, dude. Enough.

877
00:37:14,965 --> 00:37:16,375
Come on.
We don't know.

878
00:37:16,379 --> 00:37:17,589
We don't know
what you're saying.

879
00:37:17,586 --> 00:37:19,166
- English, Stefany. English.
- [Kelle] Not fair.

880
00:37:19,172 --> 00:37:24,452
The fact that Pola
keeps speaking in Spanish
with Stef and Jose,

881
00:37:24,448 --> 00:37:26,028
I don't know what
they're talking about that

882
00:37:26,034 --> 00:37:27,904
they can't speak
in English about.

883
00:37:27,896 --> 00:37:30,446
So, it's honestly,
it's getting annoying.

884
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:31,718
[Stefany speaking]

885
00:37:31,724 --> 00:37:32,864
[Pola speaking]

886
00:37:32,862 --> 00:37:34,412
[Kelle] Oh.

887
00:37:34,413 --> 00:37:36,413
Are you guys done
speaking Spanish?

888
00:37:36,413 --> 00:37:37,903
[Stefany speaking]

889
00:37:37,896 --> 00:37:38,966
- [Kelle] It's rude.
- No.

890
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,065
I'm telling you it's rude.

891
00:37:40,068 --> 00:37:41,448
Oh, no, no.

892
00:37:41,448 --> 00:37:43,138
It's just a bad habit.

893
00:37:43,137 --> 00:37:44,307
- Bad habit.
- It's rude.

894
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:46,210
It's my first language.
Our first language.

895
00:37:46,206 --> 00:37:47,546
But you're not...

896
00:37:47,551 --> 00:37:49,591
you're not here to speak
your first language.

897
00:37:49,586 --> 00:37:52,206
[indistinct chatter]

898
00:37:52,206 --> 00:37:54,516
But it's rude
when you do that
in front of other people

899
00:37:54,517 --> 00:37:55,757
like Ricky or me.

900
00:37:55,758 --> 00:37:57,168
Do you speak Spanish?

901
00:37:57,172 --> 00:37:59,102
- No, but we're...
we're translating with Ricky.
- [Ricky speaking]

902
00:37:59,103 --> 00:38:00,973
[Kelle]
But they're translating.

903
00:38:00,965 --> 00:38:02,335
Yeah, we translate.

904
00:38:02,344 --> 00:38:05,344
We... Well, whatever
they want you to think
that they're saying.

905
00:38:05,344 --> 00:38:07,104
[Pola] No, no, no.
We're not that kind of people.

906
00:38:07,103 --> 00:38:10,073
We won't do that to you,
to you or to anyone.

907
00:38:10,068 --> 00:38:12,828
Listen, if had anything
bad to say to you,
I'll tell it to your face.

908
00:38:12,827 --> 00:38:14,237
I'm not gonna
translate to her.

909
00:38:14,241 --> 00:38:15,411
Come on.

910
00:38:15,413 --> 00:38:17,833
What is wrong with her?
Why can't we speak Spanish?

911
00:38:17,827 --> 00:38:20,097
I'm telling you,
if we have something
to say bad, we'll tell her.

912
00:38:20,103 --> 00:38:21,453
[Pola speaking]

913
00:38:21,448 --> 00:38:25,828
[Stefany] I mean,
maybe she is self-conscious, insecure.

914
00:38:25,827 --> 00:38:27,167
I don't know.

915
00:38:30,896 --> 00:38:32,786
It's not about me thinking
you're talking about me.

916
00:38:32,793 --> 00:38:34,973
Just ask us.
It's about respect.

917
00:38:34,965 --> 00:38:36,475
Next time...
next time...

918
00:38:36,482 --> 00:38:38,482
You know, we'll create
a group setting where
everyone speaks English...

919
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:40,212
[Stefany] Usually
when I speak that language...

920
00:38:40,206 --> 00:38:43,306
when I talk, I'm next to her,
I'm gonna talk to her Spanish.

921
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:44,830
[indistinct chatter]

922
00:38:44,827 --> 00:38:46,967
[Jose] <i>I hear a lot
of screaming downstairs</i>

923
00:38:46,965 --> 00:38:49,965
and I hear Kelle is the one
that's screaming.

924
00:38:49,965 --> 00:38:53,445
<i>She's still going around
the same thing about
the language barrier.</i>

925
00:38:53,448 --> 00:38:55,478
This is so dramatic
and unnecessary.

926
00:38:55,482 --> 00:38:56,792
<i>I should stop this.</i>

927
00:38:56,793 --> 00:38:58,243
[Kelle] Oh,
what are you talking about?

928
00:38:58,241 --> 00:39:00,381
- So, it's fine.
- [Stefany] What is the matter?
We speak languages.

929
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:02,659
Then go speak it
when you're by yourself.

930
00:39:02,655 --> 00:39:04,475
- [Pola] No.
- [Pola speaking]

931
00:39:04,482 --> 00:39:05,832
[Jose speaking]

932
00:39:05,827 --> 00:39:07,757
[Kelle speaking]

933
00:39:08,896 --> 00:39:10,276
[Jose speaking]

934
00:39:10,275 --> 00:39:11,925
[Kelle speaking]

935
00:39:11,931 --> 00:39:16,761
[Jose] Seeing that situation,
it actually showed
a little bit on the other side

936
00:39:16,758 --> 00:39:19,448
the darker side of Kelle
that I didn't know.

937
00:39:19,448 --> 00:39:21,928
<i>And I don't find it
attractive.</i>

938
00:39:22,724 --> 00:39:24,344
[Pola speaking]

939
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:27,970
[sighs]

940
00:39:28,931 --> 00:39:30,341
[Pola speaking]

941
00:39:30,344 --> 00:39:31,694
[Stefany] <i>If I have
something to say,</i>

942
00:39:31,689 --> 00:39:33,689
I don't need to talk
to somebody else in Spanish.

943
00:39:33,689 --> 00:39:35,029
I'll tell her directly.

944
00:39:35,034 --> 00:39:37,664
<i>I actually...
I never even thought of this.</i>

945
00:39:37,655 --> 00:39:39,025
We're in Mexico.

946
00:39:39,034 --> 00:39:40,414
We could speak Spanish.

947
00:39:40,413 --> 00:39:43,213
And if you don't understand,
too bad.

948
00:39:45,103 --> 00:39:46,903
Kelle, where are you?

949
00:39:46,896 --> 00:39:48,276
It's me, Stef.

950
00:39:48,275 --> 00:39:49,515
Hey.
I'm sorry.

951
00:39:49,517 --> 00:39:51,097
I don't want you
to feel like that.

952
00:39:51,103 --> 00:39:53,523
I swear we're not talking
bad about you.

953
00:39:53,517 --> 00:39:55,787
No, you guys are like
laughing at me.

954
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:57,723
[Stefany] Why would
we laugh about you?

955
00:39:57,724 --> 00:40:00,244
No, because you're like,
oh, we would never,
like talk about you.

956
00:40:00,241 --> 00:40:01,931
It has nothing to do
with you.

957
00:40:01,931 --> 00:40:06,141
I could speak Spanish
all day with her,
here, down there.

958
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:09,517
But I think
there's other people
that maybe if they just...

959
00:40:09,517 --> 00:40:11,207
Okay. Well, then
have them come to me.

960
00:40:11,206 --> 00:40:12,406
Because her
and I are talking...

961
00:40:12,413 --> 00:40:14,103
- But you guys don't care.
- ...about family and kid...

962
00:40:14,103 --> 00:40:15,413
You guys don't care.

963
00:40:16,862 --> 00:40:18,032
[Pola speaking]

964
00:40:18,034 --> 00:40:19,484
- Right. But that's not...
- She's still...

965
00:40:19,482 --> 00:40:21,592
Yeah.
But don't...

966
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:23,826
don't capture that energy.

967
00:40:23,827 --> 00:40:26,097
She becomes like fire.

968
00:40:26,103 --> 00:40:27,413
Like it's...

969
00:40:27,413 --> 00:40:29,833
I don't like people
being disrespectful.

970
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:31,687
- I'm not like that.
- I know.

971
00:40:31,689 --> 00:40:33,209
- So, I don't feel comfortable.
- I agree, I...

972
00:40:33,206 --> 00:40:34,786
She's shouting at me,
just like...

973
00:40:36,206 --> 00:40:37,686
I'm not used
to people like that.

974
00:40:37,689 --> 00:40:38,929
Right.

975
00:40:38,931 --> 00:40:40,831
Like, I feel
I'm really well educated.

976
00:40:40,827 --> 00:40:42,517
I mean, we can talk,
we can speak.

977
00:40:42,517 --> 00:40:44,027
- It's fine.
- [Jose] Yeah.

978
00:40:44,034 --> 00:40:48,314
Like, the action of it
is just shouting without
a reason or anything.

979
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:50,860
- You're exploiting people.
It's what you're doing.
- [Stefany] No.

980
00:40:50,862 --> 00:40:52,522
- No, no, no. No, no, no, no.
- Oh, you all are.

981
00:40:52,517 --> 00:40:53,967
- It's what you're doing.
- [Stefany] No.

982
00:40:53,965 --> 00:40:58,445
[Jose] It's starts to give me
some second thoughts
about her.

983
00:40:58,448 --> 00:41:01,238
Hopefully you're gonna
meet another woman
from there

984
00:41:01,241 --> 00:41:03,691
and leave Kelle just
by its side.

985
00:41:04,103 --> 00:41:05,143
By side.

986
00:41:05,137 --> 00:41:06,377
[Jose speaking]

987
00:41:06,379 --> 00:41:07,759
Hopefully.

988
00:41:12,551 --> 00:41:14,341
Cool.
Now I'm the bad guy.

989
00:41:15,482 --> 00:41:18,482
I'm not the bad guy,
'cause I don't speak Spanish.

990
00:41:18,482 --> 00:41:20,172
[Stefany speaking]

991
00:41:20,172 --> 00:41:21,522
[laughs]

992
00:41:22,689 --> 00:41:24,169
[bleep]

993
00:41:29,793 --> 00:41:32,833
We want you to come up
with a dance that best
communicates design.

994
00:41:32,827 --> 00:41:34,997
[cheering]

995
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,100
[Jose] The shirt comes off
and all the ladies go crazy.

996
00:41:38,103 --> 00:41:39,793
[cheering]

997
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:44,690
[Gabriel] <i>So, I'm excited
for my first date,
I get to go out the villa.</i>

998
00:41:44,689 --> 00:41:47,659
I've never been
on a double date
with my mom before.

999
00:41:47,655 --> 00:41:52,135
I would have never thought
that I would be here
with such a beautiful woman.

1000
00:41:52,137 --> 00:41:55,657
[April J] I honestly
can't remember the last time
I had so much fun on a date.

1001
00:41:55,655 --> 00:41:57,305
[Gabriel] He's trying to hit
on my mom

1002
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:58,830
and it's not sitting
right with me.

1003
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:04,830
To me, personally, you're
the most intriguing person
in the house.

1004
00:42:04,827 --> 00:42:06,657
I want to be with Jose.

1005
00:42:06,655 --> 00:42:08,205
- I love my son.
- Okay.

1006
00:42:08,206 --> 00:42:13,236
It is a bit of mama's boy
going on with Jose and Pola.

1007
00:42:13,241 --> 00:42:16,861
They don't really have
the right sized condoms
for me here.

1008
00:42:17,896 --> 00:42:19,656
He said he has a big [bleep].

1009
00:42:19,655 --> 00:42:20,965
How does it make you feel?

1010
00:42:20,965 --> 00:42:22,235
[laughs]

1011
00:42:24,551 --> 00:42:26,241
[Ryan speaking]

1012
00:42:26,241 --> 00:42:28,031
He's already
asking my girl on a date.

1013
00:42:28,034 --> 00:42:29,344
Who?
You and I?

1014
00:42:29,344 --> 00:42:33,214
I do Gabriel a lot,
but I'm a little confused
at this point.

1015
00:42:33,758 --> 00:42:35,548
[Ryan speaking]

1016
00:42:35,551 --> 00:42:37,691
It's about to get
a little more dramatic.
