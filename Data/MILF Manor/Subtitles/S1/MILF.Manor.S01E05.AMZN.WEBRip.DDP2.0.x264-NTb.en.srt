1
00:00:04,482 --> 00:00:07,592
Do you ever thought
about who you want to date?

2
00:00:07,586 --> 00:00:09,996
Ever since I got here,
I've been thinking
about who I wanna date.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,100
- Does that include me? No.
- Sure.

4
00:00:12,103 --> 00:00:14,413
<i>I was shocked that
he's been thinking about me,</i>

5
00:00:14,413 --> 00:00:17,593
I love him more than ever.

6
00:00:17,586 --> 00:00:20,096
[Jose] I would love to go on
a date or something.

7
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:23,483
I like Soyoung a lot,
but Shannon
is a very special woman,

8
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:26,382
and I would love
to get to know each other
a little bit deeper.

9
00:00:26,379 --> 00:00:28,929
How do you feel when you see
the exterior of me,

10
00:00:28,931 --> 00:00:30,281
being an older woman?

11
00:00:30,275 --> 00:00:31,475
I mean, I see your elegance.

12
00:00:31,482 --> 00:00:33,592
All right, I'll take that.

13
00:00:33,586 --> 00:00:35,206
<i>Jose is hard to figure out.</i>

14
00:00:35,206 --> 00:00:38,166
I feel like he may
give everyone that
kind of attention,

15
00:00:38,172 --> 00:00:39,592
so you don't know
if you're special.

16
00:00:39,586 --> 00:00:40,786
[Ryan] Let's make a bet.

17
00:00:40,793 --> 00:00:43,283
Gabriel can't come
to your room
for one solid day.

18
00:00:43,275 --> 00:00:44,995
Oh my God.
[laughs]

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,900
I know Gabriel
feels threatened, but I'm not.

20
00:00:46,896 --> 00:00:48,896
[Stefany speaking]

21
00:00:52,413 --> 00:00:54,833
It's so unattractive
being controlling and stuff,

22
00:00:54,827 --> 00:00:58,097
and I felt like that's such
a weird way of looking
at things.

23
00:00:58,103 --> 00:01:00,833
The results
of the chemistry tests are in.

24
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:01,997
[gasping]

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,900
There's one mother and son
that scored the lowest.

26
00:01:04,896 --> 00:01:07,166
- [Lisa] Oh.
- And they will be going home.

27
00:01:07,172 --> 00:01:08,382
Oh.

28
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:11,479
April and Ricky, it's time
for you to leave the villa.

29
00:01:11,482 --> 00:01:13,282
- Oh, no.
- Wow.

30
00:01:13,275 --> 00:01:14,475
It just got real.

31
00:01:14,482 --> 00:01:15,692
[indistinct chatter]

32
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:17,379

33

[indistinct shouting]

34
00:01:30,379 --> 00:01:31,999
[doorbell ringing]

35
00:01:39,206 --> 00:01:44,476
What, a new mom and son,
what the hell is going on?

36
00:01:44,482 --> 00:01:48,102
Oh, my God,
you have to be kidding me.

37
00:01:48,103 --> 00:01:50,003
- Oh.
- Oh, my God.

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,170
A new mom.

39
00:01:51,172 --> 00:01:54,102
Holy [bleep] I wasn't
expecting this at all.

40
00:01:54,103 --> 00:01:56,383
[indistinct chatter]

41
00:01:56,379 --> 00:01:58,379
Oh, my God.

42
00:01:58,724 --> 00:02:00,904
Hi.

43
00:02:00,896 --> 00:02:02,476
Oh, my God.

44
00:02:04,206 --> 00:02:06,786
Hello.

45
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,210
Hi.

46
00:02:09,206 --> 00:02:10,716
- What's your name?
- Lisa.

47
00:02:10,724 --> 00:02:12,074
Joey, nice to meet you man.

48
00:02:12,068 --> 00:02:13,378
- What's your name?
- Ryan, hi.

49
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:15,519
Ryan, oh, we got
two Ryans now.

50
00:02:15,517 --> 00:02:17,587
Oh, there are two Ryans,
all right.

51
00:02:17,586 --> 00:02:20,786
It hasn't even been
a full 24 hours that April

52
00:02:20,793 --> 00:02:24,213
and Ricky are gone,
and now we have newcomers.

53
00:02:24,206 --> 00:02:26,516
Hey, Ryan,
nice meeting you.

54
00:02:26,517 --> 00:02:29,997
[Shannan] <i>Like, we have
no idea what to expect</i>

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,480
<i>at any given time.</i>

56
00:02:31,482 --> 00:02:32,902
Plus, I don't know them.

57
00:02:32,896 --> 00:02:34,686
- Look like really,
really nice people.
- Yeah.

58
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:36,589
So, like, I don't know
if they can handle everything

59
00:02:36,586 --> 00:02:38,206
that's been going on
in the house already.

60
00:02:38,206 --> 00:02:40,896
Like... I'm like,
are they ready
to sign up for this crazy?

61
00:02:40,896 --> 00:02:42,616
Sorry, but what's your name?

62
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,900
- Stefany.
- Stefany, Lisa.

63
00:02:44,896 --> 00:02:47,786
Stefany, I will remember,
okay, oh my God.

64
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:51,213
[Kelle] <i>Well, lo and behold,
we have two newcomers,</i>

65
00:02:51,206 --> 00:02:54,786
and I'm thinking,
I'm wearing a bikini,

66
00:02:54,793 --> 00:02:58,383
and she's wearing a mu-mu,
no competition.

67
00:02:58,379 --> 00:02:59,929
- Hi, how you doing?
- April.

68
00:02:59,931 --> 00:03:02,411
April, I'm born in April,
I can remember your name.

69
00:03:02,413 --> 00:03:03,523
[indistinct shouting]

70
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:04,687
Good God!

71
00:03:06,827 --> 00:03:09,277
I'm Ryan, and this is
my beautiful mom, Lisa.

72
00:03:09,275 --> 00:03:12,165
Aw, thank you, honey.

73
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:16,099
- Nice to meet you.
- [Lisa speaking]

74
00:03:16,103 --> 00:03:18,283
I know, I wanted
to do it again, yeah.

75
00:03:18,275 --> 00:03:21,685
My mom's big personality
is definitely something
that stands out.

76
00:03:21,689 --> 00:03:24,689
<i>She used to be an actress back
in the '80s and '90s</i>

77
00:03:24,689 --> 00:03:27,999
<i>and still has that
big outgoing personality.</i>

78
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,520
Ryan two, Ryan two.

79
00:03:29,517 --> 00:03:32,097
Ryan... oh, man,
okay, it's a great name.

80
00:03:32,103 --> 00:03:35,413
[Lisa] <i>Ryan is just
this all-around guy,</i>

81
00:03:35,413 --> 00:03:40,483
he's amazingly artistic,
he paints and he composes
classical music.

82
00:03:40,482 --> 00:03:42,412
<i>I mean,
he's absolutely amazing.</i>

83
00:03:42,413 --> 00:03:45,283
<i>I came on this retreat
to really spend</i>

84
00:03:45,275 --> 00:03:48,825
some quality time
with my son and also for us

85
00:03:48,827 --> 00:03:51,167
both to be looking for love
at the same time.

86
00:03:51,172 --> 00:03:53,172
And maybe the missing piece
is that I've needed

87
00:03:53,172 --> 00:03:54,482
his opinion the whole time.

88
00:03:54,482 --> 00:03:56,102
[laughing]

89
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:58,483
You guys give us
one second here, one second.

90
00:03:58,482 --> 00:04:01,482
So just occurred to me,
you may not have any idea...

91
00:04:01,482 --> 00:04:02,832
- what's going on.
- [indistinct chatter]

92
00:04:02,827 --> 00:04:05,827
Yeah, so welcome,
you are on a dating retreat.

93
00:04:05,827 --> 00:04:07,307
- Yes, we know that.
- Okay.

94
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,280
- Okay, we know that much.
- We're here... We're all moms.

95
00:04:09,275 --> 00:04:11,305
...we get to spend...
Yeah. Okay, all moms,
with your sons.

96
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,000
- And these are our sons.
- With your sons, got it.

97
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,100
Yes.

98
00:04:14,103 --> 00:04:16,383
And the purpose is to get
to know the sons.

99
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:17,589
And to break
the age barriers.

100
00:04:17,586 --> 00:04:19,376
- And the purpose for you...
- Age is just a number.

101
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:20,689
- ...is to get to know
the moms.
- Right.

102
00:04:20,689 --> 00:04:21,829
Okay.
And be open.

103
00:04:21,827 --> 00:04:23,207
[laughing]

104
00:04:23,206 --> 00:04:25,066
I'm just trying to get
a lay of the land, and like,

105
00:04:25,068 --> 00:04:26,898
I didn't know all the moms
were going to be here.

106
00:04:26,896 --> 00:04:29,926
<i>It's the mom's sons
that is the dating pool.</i>

107
00:04:29,931 --> 00:04:34,311
I thought it was going to be
other people, other guys.

108
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,690
Let's go take out to the bar
and get a drink,
everybody can come.

109
00:04:36,689 --> 00:04:38,899
[Ryan] Yes, please, necessary.

110
00:04:38,896 --> 00:04:43,096
So, I'm meeting a potential,
and then the mom, so very...

111
00:04:43,103 --> 00:04:45,723
very interesting,
very interesting,
what can I say?

112
00:04:47,103 --> 00:04:49,003
[Jose] Tell me if you want
one more tequila.

113
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,070
[Lisa] Thank you.

114
00:04:50,068 --> 00:04:51,208
<i>- Gracias...</i>
- [Jose] <i>Salud.</i>

115
00:04:51,206 --> 00:04:53,516
- Okay.
- That is our
resident bartender.

116
00:04:53,517 --> 00:04:54,717
[Lisa] Oh, okay.

117
00:04:55,931 --> 00:04:57,311
What do you make with that?

118
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,070
- He does a great job
of making...
- [Jose] Magic.

119
00:05:00,068 --> 00:05:02,168
Yeah, he does, he really...
it really is magic.

120
00:05:02,172 --> 00:05:03,692
And this is
a grapefruit, correct?

121
00:05:03,689 --> 00:05:04,829
Yes.

122
00:05:04,827 --> 00:05:06,587
- Yeah, oh,
I love grapefruit...
- [Shannan] Yeah.

123
00:05:06,586 --> 00:05:08,476
- ...because it's so sour...
- Yeah, pretty sure.

124
00:05:08,482 --> 00:05:09,792
...in my opinion.

125
00:05:09,793 --> 00:05:11,283
[Jose] The balance
is sweetness,

126
00:05:11,275 --> 00:05:12,715
you look like
you're very sweet,

127
00:05:12,724 --> 00:05:14,284
so... so the balance
is sweetness.

128
00:05:14,275 --> 00:05:15,785
[laughs]

129
00:05:15,793 --> 00:05:18,483
You're good, I look sweet.

130
00:05:18,482 --> 00:05:20,312
[Lisa speaking]

131
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,790
He's adorable.

132
00:05:21,793 --> 00:05:26,073
<i>I am 1,000% sure that Lisa
is going to be taken</i>

133
00:05:26,068 --> 00:05:29,788
in by Jose's good looks
and charm,

134
00:05:29,793 --> 00:05:33,623
you know, Mr. Charismatic,
but I'm not giving up on Jose,

135
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,480
<i>he's my... my one and only,</i>

136
00:05:35,482 --> 00:05:39,592
and so I need to make sure
that there's not too much

137
00:05:39,586 --> 00:05:41,276
face time with the new girl.

138
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:43,785
So, like, have you dated
younger guys before?

139
00:05:43,793 --> 00:05:45,793
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, how young?

140
00:05:45,793 --> 00:05:47,593
27 years younger.

141
00:05:47,586 --> 00:05:50,476
- Wow.
- Yeah.

142
00:05:50,482 --> 00:05:53,382
I find younger men
better in the bedroom.

143
00:05:53,379 --> 00:05:54,479
Do you want
a grapefruit drink?

144
00:05:54,482 --> 00:05:55,792
I think I would
like that, please.

145
00:05:55,793 --> 00:05:57,383
- Let me find the shaker.
- Okay.

146
00:05:57,379 --> 00:06:00,519
[Lisa] <i>Older men have
an insecurity about them,</i>

147
00:06:00,517 --> 00:06:02,687
it's kind of annoying,
it's like
they needed constant,

148
00:06:02,689 --> 00:06:05,589
like, you know,
like being a mom to them.

149
00:06:05,586 --> 00:06:07,786
Oh, honey, you look fine,
it's okay, I know

150
00:06:07,793 --> 00:06:09,103
your hair's receding,
it happens.

151
00:06:09,103 --> 00:06:11,523
Look what's happening to me,
you know... I don't know.

152
00:06:11,517 --> 00:06:13,477
So, they needed more,
like, coddling.

153
00:06:13,482 --> 00:06:14,902
Where do you live?

154
00:06:14,896 --> 00:06:17,476
I live in Boston,
but I'm a senior engineer, so.

155
00:06:17,482 --> 00:06:19,482
Okay, wow.

156
00:06:19,482 --> 00:06:21,482
Oh, it's nice,
very, very smart.

157
00:06:21,482 --> 00:06:23,282
Engineer,
what kind of engineer?

158
00:06:23,275 --> 00:06:24,895
- I'm a software engineer.
- Okay.

159
00:06:24,896 --> 00:06:26,306
Yeah, mostly like
machine learning,

160
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,520
artificial intelligence,
and stuff.

161
00:06:27,517 --> 00:06:28,687
Okay, okay.

162
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:30,479
[Stefany] <i>I usually
date professionals,</i>

163
00:06:30,482 --> 00:06:33,482

that Ryan

actually has
an amazing career.

165
00:06:35,517 --> 00:06:38,167
I mean, he seems pretty mature
for his age,

166
00:06:38,172 --> 00:06:40,722
<i>and I'm excited
to get to know him.</i>

167
00:06:40,724 --> 00:06:41,904
This is nice.

168
00:06:41,896 --> 00:06:42,996
Thanks so much.

169
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,170
[Stefany] Yeah, it's nice.

a little bit like</i>

171
00:06:45,482 --> 00:06:46,692
<i>I've been tossed
into the deep end.</i>

172
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:48,619
[Ryan S speaking]

173
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,790
...but the first one
who catches my eye

174
00:06:50,793 --> 00:06:53,073
<i>is Stefany,
she is really pretty,</i>

175
00:06:53,068 --> 00:06:55,478
<i>dressed in kind of
a classy way.</i>

176
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:57,072
<i>It seems like someone
I maybe want to get</i>

177
00:06:57,068 --> 00:06:59,588
to know better,
interest is big for me.

178
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,380
So, who are you
taking out first?

179
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:03,719
You.

180
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:05,794
[laughing]

181
00:07:07,275 --> 00:07:09,895
Oh, he's going
to take me out first.

182
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:12,376
[Ryan] <i>I think Stefany
needs that attention.</i>

183
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:15,099
I think it's her dream
to have, like,
men fight over her.

184
00:07:15,103 --> 00:07:16,903
See, I knew it, I knew it.

185
00:07:17,586 --> 00:07:19,786
[Ryan] <i>With Stefany...</i>

186
00:07:21,931 --> 00:07:25,101
Internally, I'm... I'm
pretty much super over it.

187
00:07:26,896 --> 00:07:29,616
<i>So I need an answer,
that's what I need
from Stefany right now.</i>

188
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,380
Is she here to date me,
is she interested in getting

189
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:35,069
to know me better
on that level or not?

190
00:07:35,068 --> 00:07:36,928
The new Ryan wants
to take me out.

191
00:07:36,931 --> 00:07:38,721
- Does he really?
- Yeah.

192
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:40,384
That's annoying...

193
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:43,789
[Gabriel speaking]

194
00:07:43,793 --> 00:07:45,483
[Gabriel] <i>At this point,
I would say Stefany</i>

195
00:07:45,482 --> 00:07:47,792
<i>and I's connection
is the strongest it's been,</i>

196
00:07:47,793 --> 00:07:50,103
<i>you know the new Ryan
can try and take her on a date</i>

197
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:52,723
<i>but she does like me
and I like her</i>

198
00:07:52,724 --> 00:07:56,004
and I think
that's unbreakable.

199
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,380
Do you still love me?

200
00:07:57,379 --> 00:08:00,169
Uh-oh, I have competition.

201
00:08:00,172 --> 00:08:01,312
What happened?

202
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:04,000
From what I can see,
it seems like Stefany

203
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,100
and Gabriel really have
a connection there.

204
00:08:07,103 --> 00:08:10,003
And so, I'm like, okay,

205
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm not going to put my eggs
in that basket.

206
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,280
[Stefany] Come on.

207
00:08:24,689 --> 00:08:26,689
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

208
00:08:26,689 --> 00:08:28,479
Aa-ha, <i>salud.</i>

209
00:08:28,482 --> 00:08:29,692
[cell phone vibrating]

210
00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:32,279
Oh, hey, guys, I got a text.

211
00:08:32,275 --> 00:08:33,685
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

212
00:08:33,689 --> 00:08:35,169
- All right.
- Here we go.

213
00:08:35,172 --> 00:08:38,282
[Charlene] Welcome
to the villa, Lisa, and Ryan.

214
00:08:38,275 --> 00:08:40,685
We have an activity plan
that is sure to get you

215
00:08:40,689 --> 00:08:43,829
well acquainted
with the other moms and sons.

216
00:08:43,827 --> 00:08:47,687
Guys always think they know
what you want in the bedroom.

217
00:08:47,689 --> 00:08:48,999
Facts.

218
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
But do they really?

219
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
The truth is, if anyone knows
about sex, it's us ladies.

220
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,280
You have the age, wisdom,
and experience,

221
00:08:59,275 --> 00:09:01,925
and now we are giving you
the opportunity

222
00:09:01,931 --> 00:09:04,591
to share that carnal knowledge
with your sons.

223
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,996
- No.
- Oh, I'm not.

224
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,100
Head inside, it's time
to teach these
young guys a lesson.

225
00:09:11,103 --> 00:09:13,313
[indistinct chatter]

226
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:14,520
A lesson.

227
00:09:14,517 --> 00:09:17,067
No books and pencil
sharpen for class,

228
00:09:17,068 --> 00:09:18,898
because the teacher is here.

229
00:09:20,517 --> 00:09:25,477
I think that Ryan and I have
a very open relationship,

230
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:27,102
but there are boundaries.

231
00:09:27,103 --> 00:09:28,793
Yeah.

232
00:09:28,793 --> 00:09:31,213
And I accidentally walked
in the room at time
and something like...

233
00:09:31,206 --> 00:09:33,276
You have not.

234
00:09:33,275 --> 00:09:34,995
I was a married woman.

235
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,210
Either way...

236
00:09:36,206 --> 00:09:38,206
[Ryan speaking]
...that's all I know.

237
00:09:38,206 --> 00:09:40,376
[Kelle] Oh, my God.

238
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:42,929
Ew.

239
00:09:42,931 --> 00:09:44,101
[Kelle] Sex ed.

240
00:09:44,103 --> 00:09:47,483
The whole internal organs.

241
00:09:47,482 --> 00:09:50,932
We're walking in,
and there's like, sex toys...

242
00:09:52,206 --> 00:09:53,686
- [Stefany] A little graphic.
- Yeah.

243
00:09:53,689 --> 00:09:54,689
[Stefany] Definitely.

244
00:09:54,689 --> 00:09:56,169
[Gabriel] Oh, my God.

245
00:09:56,172 --> 00:09:57,792
Oh, we got a crisp show.

246
00:09:58,482 --> 00:10:00,102
- Ew.
- All right.

247
00:10:00,103 --> 00:10:02,173
I'm really excited about
the sex ed class,

248
00:10:02,172 --> 00:10:05,592
because older women definitely
are more advanced

249
00:10:05,586 --> 00:10:09,716
in the bedroom,
we can teach a few things.

250
00:10:10,793 --> 00:10:12,593
Oh, my gosh.

251
00:10:12,586 --> 00:10:14,376
Oh.

252
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:18,719
Oh, my land, oh, my land,
this is going too far

253
00:10:18,724 --> 00:10:20,694
and I don't want
to see that, you know.

254
00:10:20,689 --> 00:10:23,379
<i>Oh, my Lord.</i>

255
00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:26,899
I'm a big fan of oral,
so I'm going to bring
in an orange,

256
00:10:26,896 --> 00:10:28,096
delicious kind of fruit.

257
00:10:28,793 --> 00:10:30,523
[laughing]

258
00:10:30,517 --> 00:10:33,717
Charlene is so turned on,
she might just, like, take him
on the table right now.

259
00:10:33,724 --> 00:10:35,524
Yeah, well that just straight
came out of nowhere.

260
00:10:35,517 --> 00:10:36,477
That was like...

261
00:10:37,413 --> 00:10:40,103
[Gabriel speaking]

262
00:10:40,103 --> 00:10:41,483
Okay.

263
00:10:41,482 --> 00:10:44,692
I see myself being
a potential match
with Stefany,

264
00:10:44,689 --> 00:10:47,999
but the elephant in the room
is her relationship
with Gabriel.

265
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,280
You're the only person [bleep]
like, somebody in this house.

266
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:51,375
You're heated.

267
00:10:57,586 --> 00:10:58,926
[indistinct chatter]

268
00:11:00,068 --> 00:11:02,378
Oh, my.

269
00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:04,519
[Jose] <i>In the table,
there's many things,</i>

270
00:11:04,517 --> 00:11:07,587
<i>all sorts of toys
and things over there,</i>

271
00:11:07,586 --> 00:11:10,516
so some people
are going to have fun.

272
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,790
- [cell phone vibrating]
- Are you guys ready?

273
00:11:13,793 --> 00:11:14,903
Yes.

274
00:11:14,896 --> 00:11:18,926
Okay, it's time
for some sex ed.

275
00:11:20,103 --> 00:11:22,073
- Moms.
- Yes.

276
00:11:22,068 --> 00:11:27,068
Please take turns
selecting questions
and quizzing your sons.

277
00:11:27,068 --> 00:11:28,588
Oh.

278
00:11:28,586 --> 00:11:30,206
I don't want to go up.

279
00:11:30,206 --> 00:11:33,756
Be sure to use all the props
by the end of this lesson.

280
00:11:33,758 --> 00:11:35,068
All the props.

281
00:11:35,068 --> 00:11:39,378
Let's hope some
of you can enjoy
the fruits of your labor.

282
00:11:40,793 --> 00:11:42,313
[producer speaking]

283
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,590
- No.
- [producer] With Joey?

284
00:11:43,586 --> 00:11:46,166
- Mmm-mmm.
- No, we never...

285
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:48,102
- [Kelle speaking]
- We never heard
of birds and bees talk.

286
00:11:48,103 --> 00:11:51,003
- [Kelle speaking]
- Bro, oh my God.

287
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,900
With the internet nowadays,
and my friends...

288
00:11:53,896 --> 00:11:56,406
come on,
how did you figure it out?

289
00:11:57,793 --> 00:12:01,383
Oh, all right,
stop it, stop it.

290
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:02,999
- I'll go first.
- Okay.

291
00:12:04,172 --> 00:12:05,792
- Go for it.
- Take it easy on them.

292
00:12:05,793 --> 00:12:06,933
Yeah.

293
00:12:06,931 --> 00:12:08,281
[laughs]

294
00:12:08,275 --> 00:12:10,305
I'm ditching class.

295
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:14,210
I think sex talks should
definitely be kept to yourself

296
00:12:14,206 --> 00:12:15,686
or with your partner.

297
00:12:15,689 --> 00:12:17,999
I don't think it should be
discussed in public

298
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,280
or just with your kids.

299
00:12:20,275 --> 00:12:24,275
<i>I rather just go to God
with all those crazy thoughts</i>

300
00:12:24,275 --> 00:12:27,685
that, you know,
come to your mind.

301
00:12:27,689 --> 00:12:28,859
You know, what do you think?

302
00:12:28,862 --> 00:12:30,592
No, I agree.

303
00:12:30,586 --> 00:12:31,996
- I guess.
- Yeah.

304
00:12:33,103 --> 00:12:36,933
So, I'm going to pick Jose.

305
00:12:36,931 --> 00:12:38,101
[indistinct shouting]

306
00:12:38,103 --> 00:12:39,593
- [indistinct]
- Jose!

307
00:12:39,586 --> 00:12:41,406
Go on up, Jose.

308
00:12:41,413 --> 00:12:42,863
- Ready?
- All right, Jose.

309
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:45,902
Ready or not, you're coming,
so it's fine.

310
00:12:45,896 --> 00:12:49,476
I really think Billy is great,
but I picked Jose,

311
00:12:49,482 --> 00:12:51,482
because I'm actually curious
to know how much

312
00:12:51,482 --> 00:12:53,282
he actually knows
in the bedroom.

313
00:12:53,275 --> 00:12:56,475
What really turns
a woman on the most?

314
00:12:57,379 --> 00:12:58,479
Oh.

315
00:12:58,482 --> 00:13:00,172
- Come on, Jose, you got this.
- Look at your...

316
00:13:00,172 --> 00:13:01,902
- [Ryan speaking]
- [Kelle] Look at your section.

317
00:13:01,896 --> 00:13:03,476
Look at your
arsenal right now.

318
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:06,072
Don't dig too deep,
pun intended.

319
00:13:06,068 --> 00:13:07,688
[bleep] Okay.

320
00:13:09,275 --> 00:13:11,065
- Point at... point...
- [Ryan] You got
to point to it.

321
00:13:11,068 --> 00:13:15,688
You can use any of these
and it will be here.

322
00:13:15,689 --> 00:13:16,859
[laughing]

323
00:13:18,482 --> 00:13:20,482
- [Kelle speaking]
- No. No, I wouldn't use this.

324
00:13:20,482 --> 00:13:23,172
But this is what I'm asking,
your... your question.

325
00:13:23,172 --> 00:13:24,862
What turns a woman
on the most?

326
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,900
[April] <i>Jose is really pretty
to look at,</i>

327
00:13:28,896 --> 00:13:34,896
but I'm wondering maybe
if he does need to be
schooled in this area?

328
00:13:34,896 --> 00:13:36,516
I don't know.

329
00:13:36,517 --> 00:13:38,587
Just tell me what pleases
the woman the most.

330
00:13:38,586 --> 00:13:41,066
When I'm... when...
well, in sexual intercourse,

331
00:13:41,068 --> 00:13:42,998
when a man finds her spot.

332
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,590
Okay.

333
00:13:44,586 --> 00:13:49,166
I'm learning, Jose might be
a little clueless,

334
00:13:50,586 --> 00:13:52,476
he needs some education.

335
00:13:52,482 --> 00:13:54,172
How would you answer
the question?

336
00:13:54,172 --> 00:13:55,762
It all starts with a touch.

337
00:13:55,758 --> 00:13:58,098
- It starts with a kiss.
- It all starts with a touch.

338
00:13:58,103 --> 00:14:00,383
[Lisa] It's almost like
you want the woman to say,

339
00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:02,069
please go there, please...

340
00:14:02,068 --> 00:14:04,068
- You shouldn't have to ask.
- Could you there now?

341
00:14:04,068 --> 00:14:06,408
You may have to tease,
it's a tease,

342
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:08,283
whether it's a kiss
or the arms

343
00:14:08,275 --> 00:14:10,475
or hands or whatever,
and you're getting there

344
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:11,622
and then you're not
going there,

345
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,170
and then you want the woman
to, like, be begging.

346
00:14:14,172 --> 00:14:16,792
[Charlene] <i>Oh, this is why
I stay single,</i>

347
00:14:16,793 --> 00:14:19,003
<i>and this is why I have
a hard time dating,</i>

348
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,480
because imagine getting
in the bedroom to that.

349
00:14:22,482 --> 00:14:25,102
These guys really need
to go to class.

350
00:14:25,103 --> 00:14:28,623
Welcome class,
welcome students,
fellow teachers.

351
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,380
- I would like my son
to answer...
- What?

352
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:32,899
[Charlene] ...the question, because...

353
00:14:32,896 --> 00:14:34,996
- How did you pick me?
- [Charlene] Why not?

354
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,900
Harrison, I've heard things,
he's got the goods.

355
00:14:37,896 --> 00:14:40,586
It's my job to make sure
he knows what to do with it.

356
00:14:40,586 --> 00:14:42,686
My sex life is very private.

357
00:14:42,689 --> 00:14:43,999
I have faith in you.

358
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,790
[Harrison] <i>This is going
to be uncomfortable.</i>

359
00:14:45,793 --> 00:14:47,623
[Charlene] Where is the labia?

360
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,380
Oh.

361
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:50,519
[Charlene] He better know.

362
00:14:50,517 --> 00:14:52,757
[Harrison] I don't...
Let me give you a hint, bro.

363
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,098
No, don't tell.

364
00:14:54,103 --> 00:14:55,213
Okay, no.

365
00:14:55,206 --> 00:14:56,896
[indistinct chatter]

366
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,280
[Charlene] No, no, no, no,
Harrison, that's not right,
try again.

367
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:01,615
- So...
- [Charlene speaking]

368
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,590
- Cervical lips.
- Yes.

369
00:15:03,586 --> 00:15:04,856
Yeah, okay.

370
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,212
And the teat.

371
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:09,790
If you were in this zone...

372
00:15:09,793 --> 00:15:11,793
[April speaking]

373
00:15:13,586 --> 00:15:15,686
Yeah, because I give birth
all the time.

374
00:15:15,689 --> 00:15:17,789
- Well...
- Well, it's open.

375
00:15:17,793 --> 00:15:20,283
I can't believe that
he doesn't know

376
00:15:20,275 --> 00:15:21,785
the other parts of the vagina.

377
00:15:21,793 --> 00:15:23,003
- God.
- I'm done.

378
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,000
Too much.

379
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,590
All you need to know
is where to put it,

380
00:15:28,586 --> 00:15:30,856
you don't need to know
all the... the part names

381
00:15:30,862 --> 00:15:33,792
and get down there
with a microscope.

382
00:15:33,793 --> 00:15:37,283
And, hey, this is that,
this is this,
this is that, no.

383
00:15:37,275 --> 00:15:39,475
This is so important,
because the bedroom,

384
00:15:39,482 --> 00:15:41,102
everything leads
to the bedroom

385
00:15:41,103 --> 00:15:42,793
and we need
to please each other,

386
00:15:42,793 --> 00:15:45,523
Because if not, this is where
we're going.

387
00:15:45,517 --> 00:15:48,927
So, you... even men to talk
about how they wanted

388
00:15:48,931 --> 00:15:51,281
to be touched,
what you guys like.

389
00:15:51,275 --> 00:15:55,095
Come on, guys,
everything is all about sex,

390
00:15:55,103 --> 00:15:57,863
this whole experience
is about sex,

391
00:15:57,862 --> 00:16:00,692
so we need to talk about sex.

392
00:16:00,689 --> 00:16:02,899
Am I right? Come on guys.

393
00:16:02,896 --> 00:16:05,856
Come on, where my ladies
are, right, right, come on.

394
00:16:05,862 --> 00:16:07,902
[indistinct shouting]

395
00:16:11,379 --> 00:16:15,379
Long live the penis,
guys, long live the penis.

396
00:16:15,379 --> 00:16:18,789
I am really surprised to see
just how passionate Charlene

397
00:16:18,793 --> 00:16:20,593
is about this sex discussion.

398
00:16:20,586 --> 00:16:23,066
She really cares about people
having, you know,

399
00:16:23,068 --> 00:16:26,588
pleasure in the bedroom,
and I think that's, you know,

400
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:28,896
it was a shock,
but also, like, honestly,

401
00:16:28,896 --> 00:16:31,166
it makes me more interested
to get to know her.

402
00:16:31,172 --> 00:16:33,002
Ryan, come on, now.

403
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,210
Let's go, Ryan.

404
00:16:34,206 --> 00:16:36,376
Come on down.

405
00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:37,759
Come on, Ryan.

406
00:16:37,758 --> 00:16:41,928
What do you think
is a woman's favorite
type of foreplay?

407
00:16:42,482 --> 00:16:43,972
- Hm.
- Hmm.

408
00:16:43,965 --> 00:16:48,165
Demonstrate your go
to foreplay technique
on one of these fruits.

409
00:16:48,172 --> 00:16:49,382
Okay.

410
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:52,169
I'm a big fan of oral,
so I'm going to bring

411
00:16:52,172 --> 00:16:53,932
in orange,
delicious kind of fruit.

412
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:55,101
[laughing]

413
00:16:56,172 --> 00:16:58,002
- Technique.
- Oh, yeah.

414
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,100
[laughing]

415
00:16:59,103 --> 00:17:02,483
Oh, yeah.

416
00:17:02,482 --> 00:17:06,282
[Lisa] <i>Seeing my son
demonstrate his skill set,</i>

417
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,855
<i>he's very much
like a professor.</i>

418
00:17:07,862 --> 00:17:11,482
Now, fortunately,
Charlene's head
was right in the way,

419
00:17:11,482 --> 00:17:12,902
that was good.

420
00:17:12,896 --> 00:17:14,856
I didn't have to turn
my head because
it was already blocked.

421
00:17:14,862 --> 00:17:16,002
He's doing a good job.

422
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,280
I'm not watching.

423
00:17:17,275 --> 00:17:18,925
[Stefany speaking]

424
00:17:18,931 --> 00:17:22,001
Ryan as his technique
with the orange,

425
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,480
I think Charlene
is so turned on,

426
00:17:24,482 --> 00:17:26,382
she might just, like take him
on the table right now.

427
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:29,379
- [Joey] Yeah, well that just
straight came out of nowhere.
- That is like...

428
00:17:29,379 --> 00:17:32,169
That was like, you expect him
to be like... kind of like

429
00:17:32,172 --> 00:17:34,902
<i>the nerdiest kid,
and then he starts going down</i>

430
00:17:34,896 --> 00:17:37,616
on the food like,
you've never seen before.

431
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,280
I mean, who are you, really?

432
00:17:39,275 --> 00:17:41,405
Great explanation.

433
00:17:41,413 --> 00:17:43,483
Great demonstration.

434
00:17:43,482 --> 00:17:44,792
[Soyoung speaking]

435
00:17:44,793 --> 00:17:46,413
<i>If he could do that,
I mean, he could make</i>

436
00:17:46,413 --> 00:17:48,073
<i>a woman happy, right?</i>

437
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:50,378
I want to see Jose doing it.

438
00:17:50,379 --> 00:17:52,309
Okay. Eenie, meenie,
miney, mo.

439
00:17:53,862 --> 00:17:54,902
I pick Jimmy.

440
00:17:54,896 --> 00:17:56,686
Okay. Okay.

441
00:17:56,689 --> 00:17:58,589
- Me and my mom
were really open...
- That's my son.

442
00:17:58,586 --> 00:17:59,856
...very young.

443
00:17:59,862 --> 00:18:01,692
Like my mom said
"anything you want
to know" I was like,

444
00:18:01,689 --> 00:18:04,519
less than ten, I'm like,
"Mom, I don't even
never kissed a girl before."

445
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:06,617
She was like,
"whatever you need to know,"

446
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,310
I'm like, "All right."

447
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,900
- He is so horny.
- Hm?

448
00:18:09,896 --> 00:18:12,896
Finishing on a woman's face,
do they find it sexy?

449
00:18:12,896 --> 00:18:15,306
Oh, I would say that's like
less than a 50% ratio,

450
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,790
I say aim for the, you know...

451
00:18:16,793 --> 00:18:18,693
- [Soyoung speaking]
- Aim for the breast
or... or down.

452
00:18:18,689 --> 00:18:23,279
A man finishing
on the face of a woman,

453
00:18:23,275 --> 00:18:24,995
do women like that?

454
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,100
- And...
- I don't know.

455
00:18:26,103 --> 00:18:27,863
Yeah, I think
they don't mind at all.

456
00:18:29,172 --> 00:18:30,592
There's your answer.

457
00:18:30,586 --> 00:18:32,476
- We need you to pick
one more question.
- You need permission.

458
00:18:32,482 --> 00:18:34,762
- You always need permission
to do that.
- You need the permission.

459
00:18:34,758 --> 00:18:36,478
- Yeah, you do.
- Whoa!

460
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:38,482
[Stefany speaking]

461
00:18:38,482 --> 00:18:40,072
I can't sit there.

462
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,170
[Jimmy] Is it that boring?

463
00:18:43,172 --> 00:18:44,762
Damn, I thought
this was pretty exciting.

464
00:18:44,758 --> 00:18:46,998
I'm sorry, there's no way.

465
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,900
It was just too intense, like,
I don't want to know about

466
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:53,376
what you do to women,
it's just too much.

467
00:18:53,379 --> 00:18:55,209
I honestly couldn't do it.

468
00:18:55,206 --> 00:18:57,476
I'm going to my room,
I'm going to my room.

469
00:18:57,482 --> 00:19:02,762
Lo and behold,
Stefany, she walks away,
Gabriel obviously follows.

470
00:19:03,931 --> 00:19:08,101
I'm calling the bluff,
Gabriel and Stefany

471
00:19:08,103 --> 00:19:10,793
are not as innocent
as they seem.

472
00:19:10,793 --> 00:19:12,243
Agreed.

473
00:19:12,241 --> 00:19:14,901
We're adults here, right,
you guys aren't like,
14 years old.

474
00:19:14,896 --> 00:19:18,896
For me, this isn't fringy
or dirty or anything,
it's part of living.

475
00:19:18,896 --> 00:19:20,756
<i>It's a natural thing
that everyone does,</i>

476
00:19:20,758 --> 00:19:22,688
like it's not taboo
in my house.

477
00:19:22,689 --> 00:19:25,759
So, when Stefany and Gabriel
just kind of run away

478
00:19:25,758 --> 00:19:28,998
like that, they're really
not open to learning
and growing.

479
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,280
At the end of the day,
as you mature,

480
00:19:31,275 --> 00:19:33,165
it's about connectivity.

481
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,792
Everyone thinks like, oh,
after menopause

482
00:19:35,793 --> 00:19:38,793
or whatever like,
woman is going to be dry.

483
00:19:38,793 --> 00:19:41,903
My experience, absolutely not,
absolutely not.

484
00:19:41,896 --> 00:19:46,096
I'm as sexual as I was
in my teens, you know.

485
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:48,523
I'm enlightened
from this class,
I learned a lot.

486
00:19:48,517 --> 00:19:50,207
[producer speaking]

487
00:19:51,862 --> 00:19:55,212
Ah, I definitely got
a lot of tips and tricks

488
00:19:55,206 --> 00:19:59,306
that could... that could maybe
go into the bedroom, too.

489
00:20:02,103 --> 00:20:03,933
Tips and tricks.

490
00:20:10,172 --> 00:20:11,522
Class dismissed.

491
00:20:11,517 --> 00:20:14,097
[indistinct shouting]

492
00:20:14,103 --> 00:20:16,903
[Jimmy] I orgasmed
three times during this class,

493
00:20:16,896 --> 00:20:18,996
- y'all didn't even know.
- [laughing]

494
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,100
Okay, I can be here
and you guys can be there,

495
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,763
but some people
are going to be like,

496
00:20:31,758 --> 00:20:33,278
in direct sun
if you don't care.

497
00:20:36,275 --> 00:20:39,095
[Gabriel speaking]

498
00:20:39,103 --> 00:20:40,283
Okay.

499
00:20:40,275 --> 00:20:42,375
[Gabriel speaking]

500
00:20:42,379 --> 00:20:47,169
Stefany specifically told me
that she does not want
to date Gabriel.

501
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,410
Oh, come on mama.

502
00:20:49,413 --> 00:20:52,213
How are you feeling
about Gabriel, honestly?

503
00:20:52,206 --> 00:20:54,996
I mean, he's funny,

504
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,900
but like more friends,
I think.

505
00:20:59,379 --> 00:21:01,479
[Ryan] <i>She said
this man is 23,</i>

506
00:21:01,482 --> 00:21:03,102
<i>she doesn't see him
in that light,</i>

507
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:05,523
but he's lying on you
on the couch.

508
00:21:05,517 --> 00:21:08,167
[Ryan speaking]

509
00:21:08,172 --> 00:21:09,902
Why are you heated, Ryan?

510
00:21:09,896 --> 00:21:11,896
[Ryan speaking]

511
00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:14,482
[Gabriel] <i>I think
his attitude is just</i>

512
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:16,382
a little too aggro for me.

513
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,410
And there's really no need
for this intense jealousy.

514
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:23,593
You guys made a bet,
she didn't wake up
at 5:00 a.m.,

515
00:21:23,586 --> 00:21:24,546
what was that about?

516
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:26,281
I'll tell you after I change
my clothes,

517
00:21:26,275 --> 00:21:27,785
unless you want to talk now.

518
00:21:27,793 --> 00:21:29,383
Why am I with her,
I thought it was...

519
00:21:29,379 --> 00:21:31,209
I'm not supposed to be next
to her for 24 hours.

520
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:34,003
All right, let's make a bet.

521
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,380
You tell me what's the bet?

522
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:38,279
All right, Gabriel can't come
to your room
for one solid day.

523
00:21:38,275 --> 00:21:39,855
Oh, my God.

524
00:21:39,862 --> 00:21:41,622
- [laughs]
- I get a full day.

525
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:44,170
<i>Stefany shared an intimate,
private conversation</i>

526
00:21:44,172 --> 00:21:45,692
<i>because she's an instigator.</i>

527
00:21:45,689 --> 00:21:47,589
<i>I don't like the fact that
I feel like Stefany</i>

528
00:21:47,586 --> 00:21:51,476
runs around behind
people's backs
and then starts narratives.

529
00:21:51,482 --> 00:21:54,522
Maybe I'm going to change
to take her class.

530
00:21:54,517 --> 00:21:56,167
Oh, you should take it,
she's great.

531
00:21:56,172 --> 00:21:57,382
Yeah.

532
00:21:57,379 --> 00:21:59,099
Stefany always leaves
at the right moment, right?

533
00:21:59,103 --> 00:22:00,283
You're heated.

534
00:22:00,275 --> 00:22:02,685
You're the only person [bleep]
somebody in this house.

535
00:22:02,689 --> 00:22:05,859
I see myself being
a potential match
with Stefany,

536
00:22:05,862 --> 00:22:09,282
but the elephant in the room
is her relationship
with Gabriel.

537
00:22:10,586 --> 00:22:12,086
I don't have [bleep] to say.

538
00:22:12,086 --> 00:22:14,586
When I walk away,
dare she not going to say
to me when I get back.

539
00:22:14,586 --> 00:22:16,476
I don't like him.

540
00:22:16,482 --> 00:22:18,172
Camaraderie.

541
00:22:18,172 --> 00:22:20,382
[Billy] <i>I think Ryan
was being a little weird,</i>

542
00:22:20,379 --> 00:22:22,589
and just trying
to claim my mom

543
00:22:22,586 --> 00:22:24,476
and steal her away
from Gabriel.

544
00:22:24,482 --> 00:22:26,692
You pissed them off for sure.

545
00:22:26,689 --> 00:22:30,479
But I didn't even...
did I instigate that?

546
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:32,692
[Stefany] <i>I'm here to date
and see who I have</i>

547
00:22:32,689 --> 00:22:34,859
<i>a connection with, that's it.</i>

548
00:22:34,862 --> 00:22:40,762
I have no idea why Ryan
thinks that I'm giving
anyone mixed signals.

549
00:22:40,758 --> 00:22:43,588
Would you like to go on
a date with Ryan, if he asked?

550
00:22:43,586 --> 00:22:46,376
Ah, right about now,
I don't want to go anywhere
with no one.

551
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,760
- Ready.
- Whoa-hu.

552
00:22:52,758 --> 00:22:56,998
Today is a day
that I'm going to make
Jose be my man.

553
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,310
So, what do you all think
about Soyoung and Jose's date?

554
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,930
You all think
they're a good match...

555
00:23:02,931 --> 00:23:04,931
- No, of course not.
- Really?

556
00:23:04,931 --> 00:23:07,001
There's going to be
a lot of heartbreaks

557
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,790
between Jose and his woman.

558
00:23:08,793 --> 00:23:09,863
[kissing]

559
00:23:17,965 --> 00:23:19,895
I don't know why you keep
giving him energy,

560
00:23:19,896 --> 00:23:21,276
stay out of each other's way.

561
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:23,585
Just stop coming around,
I don't come around him.

562
00:23:23,586 --> 00:23:25,376
[Shannan] <i>I'm going to call it
what I see,</i>

563
00:23:25,379 --> 00:23:29,099
I'm putting it on Stefany
because she's the more mature

564
00:23:29,103 --> 00:23:34,283
of these two young men,
and I think that she's given
some mixed signals.

565
00:23:34,275 --> 00:23:36,025
Stefany, you got a second?

566
00:23:36,034 --> 00:23:38,004
- [Stefany] Yeah, babe.
- Come... come sit.

567
00:23:39,344 --> 00:23:40,624
What happened?

568
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,790
So, I'm a...
I'm a problem solver,
that's what I do.

569
00:23:42,793 --> 00:23:44,593
- And it don't work
without Gabriel.
- [Stefany] Same.

570
00:23:44,586 --> 00:23:46,376
Okay, you have a second,
just have a sit.

571
00:23:46,379 --> 00:23:48,899
- Same, I am like, so...
- Let's conclude this drama,
or whatever.

572
00:23:48,896 --> 00:23:50,656
- Right?
- Question number one.

573
00:23:51,137 --> 00:23:52,277
What's wrong?

574
00:23:52,275 --> 00:23:54,475
Why is Gabe... you know
what's wrong, come on, dude.

575
00:23:54,482 --> 00:23:55,862
Oh.

576
00:23:55,862 --> 00:23:58,282
Why is Gabriel asking me
about the bet that
we made yesterday?

577
00:23:58,275 --> 00:24:00,895
He overheard,
I was telling Billy.

578
00:24:00,896 --> 00:24:03,276
[Stefany speaking]

579
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,475
[Billy speaking]

580
00:24:04,482 --> 00:24:06,102
[Stefany speaking]

581
00:24:06,103 --> 00:24:08,483
[Gabriel speaking]

582
00:24:08,482 --> 00:24:10,032
You're not gonna
wake up at 5:00.

583
00:24:10,034 --> 00:24:12,174
- [laughing]
- You're joking.

584
00:24:12,172 --> 00:24:14,172
What I want
to make sure is that,

585
00:24:14,172 --> 00:24:17,142
there are not mixed signals
going both ways, because...

586
00:24:17,137 --> 00:24:18,657
There is not.

587
00:24:18,655 --> 00:24:22,475
...what's happening is I see
Gabriel right here
laying all over you,

588
00:24:22,482 --> 00:24:24,172
there's no boundaries
that are there.

589
00:24:24,172 --> 00:24:26,452
No, the thing
with Gabriel is because, like,

590
00:24:26,448 --> 00:24:29,338
we've established, like,
a friendship, I...

591
00:24:29,344 --> 00:24:30,794
that's all it's been.

592
00:24:30,793 --> 00:24:32,553
- Have you told Gabriel...
- [Stefany] He knows.

593
00:24:32,551 --> 00:24:34,381
- ...that you feel like
he's just a friend?
- He knows.

594
00:24:34,379 --> 00:24:36,279
- How does he know?
- He knows, he...

595
00:24:36,275 --> 00:24:37,475
[Ryan] No. No.

596
00:24:37,482 --> 00:24:39,692
[Stefany] Yes,
he does know, bring him...

597
00:24:39,689 --> 00:24:41,099
that's not true.

598
00:24:41,103 --> 00:24:42,793
- And this is where
the problem stems?
- [Stefany] He knows.

599
00:24:42,793 --> 00:24:44,173
[Ryan] <i>I'm not buying
what she's selling.</i>

600
00:24:44,172 --> 00:24:46,482
No, you're lying.

601
00:24:46,482 --> 00:24:48,662
Stop...

602
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:49,965
Straight fiction.

603
00:24:49,965 --> 00:24:52,445
He and I
are good friends, like...
and I'm friends with...

604
00:24:52,448 --> 00:24:53,588
Did you tell him that.

605
00:24:53,586 --> 00:24:55,476
I... I feel like I'm friends
with you, too.

606
00:24:55,482 --> 00:24:57,282
I don't want friends
that aren't truthful with me,

607
00:24:57,275 --> 00:24:58,515
are you seeing
what I'm saying.

608
00:24:58,517 --> 00:25:00,237
- How am I not truthful
to you, Ryan?
- I don't want...

609
00:25:00,241 --> 00:25:01,791
Because I feel like
you spin stories.

610
00:25:01,793 --> 00:25:03,003
How?

611
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,590
- Because...
- Okay, I'm not going
to do this.

612
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,276
Because he's acting crazy.

613
00:25:06,275 --> 00:25:09,165
Okay, he's acting crazy,
but you're telling me,
I'm spinning stories.

614
00:25:09,172 --> 00:25:10,592
Because you didn't ask
that question.

615
00:25:10,586 --> 00:25:11,966
I'm okay,
I'm okay, whatever.

616
00:25:11,965 --> 00:25:13,585
- Do you see...
- I'm done, I'm done.

617
00:25:13,586 --> 00:25:14,966
[Ryan] It does not occur
to you?

618
00:25:14,965 --> 00:25:16,375
[Stefany] Honestly,
I'm not doing this.

619
00:25:16,379 --> 00:25:19,549
<i>That was awkward,
he's talking to me
with his mom.</i>

620
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:23,901
You know, he's pinpointing me
with his mom and saying
I'm creating this.

621
00:25:23,896 --> 00:25:26,236
I... I honestly don't want
anything to do with it.

622
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:29,445
It's... it's just crazy,
it's crazy to me.

623
00:25:29,448 --> 00:25:30,588
[Ryan] But it's coming
from you.

624
00:25:30,586 --> 00:25:32,236
No, Ryan, I'm good.
I'm good.

625
00:25:32,241 --> 00:25:34,451
- That's fine,
I'm... I'm better.
- [Stefany] I'm good.

626
00:25:34,448 --> 00:25:35,588
I don't either.

627
00:25:35,586 --> 00:25:37,686
[Stefany] It's freaking
ridiculous, [bleep] that.

628
00:25:37,689 --> 00:25:39,479
- People show you who they are.
- [Ryan] Yes.

629
00:25:39,482 --> 00:25:41,382
So, she just showed you
who she was.

630
00:25:42,896 --> 00:25:45,376
Oh, you missed
all the [bleep] drama.

631
00:25:45,379 --> 00:25:47,899
Shannon and Ryan
called me over,

632
00:25:47,896 --> 00:25:50,336
he got mad because of the...

633
00:25:50,344 --> 00:25:53,004
you laying on the couch,
you were leaning over.

634
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,480
Am I not allowed...
is he your girl...
are you, his girlfriend?

635
00:25:55,482 --> 00:25:56,792
No.

636
00:26:04,793 --> 00:26:06,453
[Gabriel] <i>I know that
she likes me and I know</i>

637
00:26:06,448 --> 00:26:08,338
<i>her and I are really going
somewhere with this.</i>

638
00:26:08,344 --> 00:26:10,904
<i>And I think Ryan's feelings
are just a little hurt</i>

639
00:26:10,896 --> 00:26:14,656
because Stefany
and I are developing
such a strong connection.

640
00:26:14,655 --> 00:26:16,685
You're a queen

641
00:26:16,689 --> 00:26:20,069
- and you don't deserve
all this unneeded stress.
- Thank you.

642
00:26:20,068 --> 00:26:23,068
<i>I like hanging out
with Gabriel,
he's a gentleman.</i>

643
00:26:23,068 --> 00:26:24,788
<i>You know, I like hanging out
with Ryan,</i>

644
00:26:24,793 --> 00:26:27,243
'cause we have
good conversations,

645
00:26:27,241 --> 00:26:29,791
but I'm... I'm not
with anybody here,

646
00:26:29,793 --> 00:26:31,283
I'm being clear
with both of...

647
00:26:31,275 --> 00:26:34,025
I haven't made a decision
with anybody here.

648
00:26:46,448 --> 00:26:49,378
[Jose speaking]

649
00:26:49,379 --> 00:26:51,969
[indistinct chatter]

650
00:26:51,965 --> 00:26:53,785
[Soyoung Speaking]

651
00:26:53,793 --> 00:26:56,863
[Jose speaking]

652
00:26:56,862 --> 00:26:59,692
Soyoung and I are going
to this whale shark

653
00:26:59,689 --> 00:27:01,999
swimming experience
because Soyoung

654
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,140
asked me out
on a date last night.

655
00:27:05,137 --> 00:27:08,477
I had a crush on you,
so would you like

656
00:27:08,482 --> 00:27:09,862
to go on a date
with me one day?

657
00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:12,792
I would love to, it will be
my pleasure and honor.

658
00:27:12,793 --> 00:27:14,553
Okay, relief.

659
00:27:14,551 --> 00:27:17,171
[Jose] <i>I've wanted to ask her
on a date for a long time.</i>

660
00:27:17,172 --> 00:27:18,692
<i>And she beat me to it.</i>

661
00:27:18,689 --> 00:27:21,169
I'm very excited
to sharing time with her

662
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:23,032
and getting to know her
a little bit more.

663
00:27:23,034 --> 00:27:25,484
They swim very, very quick.

664
00:27:25,482 --> 00:27:29,902
Today is the day that
I'm going to make Jose
to be my man.

665
00:27:29,896 --> 00:27:31,376
[chuckles]

666
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:35,481
Welcome, everyone on board,
my name is Armando,

667
00:27:35,482 --> 00:27:37,142
and I'm going...
I'm gonna be your guide.

668
00:27:37,137 --> 00:27:40,277
So, we're going to do
the activity of swimming
with the whale shark.

669
00:27:40,275 --> 00:27:41,655
- [Jose] Amazing. Okay.
- Sounds good.

670
00:27:41,655 --> 00:27:43,375
- [Jose speaking]
- [Soyoung] Thank you.

671
00:27:43,379 --> 00:27:45,479
Let me introduce you
to captain,
the captain is Roberto.

672
00:27:45,482 --> 00:27:46,862
[speaking foreign language]

673
00:27:46,862 --> 00:27:49,032
Bye-bye.

674
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:51,174
[Soyoung speaking]

675
00:27:51,793 --> 00:27:52,903
[Jose speaking]

676
00:27:52,896 --> 00:27:54,446
[Jose] I'm super excited.

677
00:27:54,448 --> 00:27:56,278
[Soyoung speaking]

678
00:27:56,275 --> 00:27:58,585
[Jose speaking]

679
00:28:00,689 --> 00:28:03,099
- [Soyoung speaking]
- [Jose] Yeah.

680
00:28:03,103 --> 00:28:05,973
<i>Soyoung, is so playful
and so happy,</i>

681
00:28:05,965 --> 00:28:09,685
I see her spirit and I can
really connect with...

682
00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:12,549
with her
and how she sees life,

683
00:28:12,551 --> 00:28:15,241
and it's something that
I am really attracted to,

684
00:28:15,241 --> 00:28:19,481
and I'm so happy
that I could be
sharing this with her.

685
00:28:19,482 --> 00:28:23,552
Whale sharks are not whales
and not sharks,

686
00:28:23,551 --> 00:28:26,661
it's actually a fish,
and this is the world's
largest fish, okay.

687
00:28:26,655 --> 00:28:29,655
[Soyoung] <i>This is
my first time ever swimming</i>

688
00:28:29,655 --> 00:28:31,235
<i>with a whale shark.</i>

689
00:28:31,241 --> 00:28:35,971
I'm very excited, I don't know
what's going on,
but I am ready.

690
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:38,165
- Ready?
- [cheering]

691
00:28:38,172 --> 00:28:41,552
Especially, you know,
Jose is gonna be next
to me, so I'm ready.

692
00:28:41,551 --> 00:28:42,791
Go, go, go.

693
00:28:53,793 --> 00:28:57,663
<i>It really is amazing
to see the magnitude</i>

694
00:28:57,655 --> 00:29:00,165
of a whale shark, it's a once
in a lifetime experience.

695
00:29:00,172 --> 00:29:01,552
- Soyoung.
- Yeah.

696
00:29:01,551 --> 00:29:02,691
Huge.

697
00:29:02,689 --> 00:29:04,789
Oh, my gosh,
look at her eyeballs.

698
00:29:04,793 --> 00:29:05,933
Yeah.

699
00:29:05,931 --> 00:29:09,691
It was unbelievable,
it was like I was in a dream.

700
00:29:09,689 --> 00:29:12,899
<i>I felt like I was getting
closer to him, you know,</i>

701
00:29:12,896 --> 00:29:15,276
and I shared
that moment with Jose.

702
00:29:15,275 --> 00:29:17,475
Oh, what a life.

703
00:29:17,482 --> 00:29:18,662
[cheering]

704
00:29:18,655 --> 00:29:20,025
<i>I just shared
something special</i>

705
00:29:20,034 --> 00:29:22,004
that I never shared
with anybody.

706
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,100
- Perfect.
- Yes. [indistinct]

707
00:29:24,103 --> 00:29:26,283
Of course, and then... look.

708
00:29:27,862 --> 00:29:29,342
[Armando speaking]

709
00:29:29,344 --> 00:29:31,864
[indistinct shouting]

710
00:29:38,482 --> 00:29:42,452
[Jose] <i>Seeing the humpbacks
and having her by my side</i>

711
00:29:42,448 --> 00:29:46,378
<i>really made that moment
a very special one for sure.</i>

712
00:29:46,379 --> 00:29:48,659
<i>And it's something
we will never forget,</i>

713
00:29:48,655 --> 00:29:51,475
and it definitely
brought us closer together.

714
00:29:51,482 --> 00:29:54,792
She is definitely the one that
I would be more interested

715
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,663
in exploring
and sharing a future with.

716
00:29:57,655 --> 00:29:59,895
That's one for the books,
like for the rest of her life.

717
00:29:59,896 --> 00:30:01,896
[Soyoung] I know, right?
That was awesome.

718
00:30:03,379 --> 00:30:04,689
Thank you.
[kissing]

719
00:30:04,689 --> 00:30:06,789
- Thank you.
- You are lovely.

720
00:30:06,793 --> 00:30:09,483
[Soyoung speaking]

721
00:30:14,172 --> 00:30:16,902
...but I could see
I could get serious with him.

722
00:30:18,793 --> 00:30:19,903
[Soyoung speaking]

723
00:30:19,896 --> 00:30:22,166
Thank you very much,
it was really special.

724
00:30:22,172 --> 00:30:24,102
- You're really special.
- [Soyoung speaking]

725
00:30:24,103 --> 00:30:25,383
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

726
00:30:37,896 --> 00:30:42,026
So, what do you all think
about Soyoung and Jose's date,

727
00:30:42,034 --> 00:30:44,284
because they went
with a whale shark watching.

728
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:46,995
I mean... that's...
that's such an experience.

729
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
[Ryan S] I think they have
the best date so far.

730
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,900
To be honest,
let me just put it out there.

731
00:30:50,896 --> 00:30:52,096
- Mmm-mmm.
- Please do, yeah.

732
00:30:52,103 --> 00:30:53,483
Please do.

733
00:30:53,482 --> 00:30:57,032
I have really
thoughtful dates with Jose.

734
00:30:57,034 --> 00:31:00,904
We connect like
on a lot of different levels.

735
00:31:00,896 --> 00:31:06,546
Jose is... is very kind
to everyone that he meets,

736
00:31:06,551 --> 00:31:09,901
that's one of the qualities
I really, really
like about him.

737
00:31:09,896 --> 00:31:13,446
But when it gets down to love,
you know, he and I have

738
00:31:13,448 --> 00:31:15,998
some really
deeper connections.

739
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,030
I do just have just one life,
and I want to make
the most of it.

740
00:31:20,034 --> 00:31:22,974
And... and there's a saying
in Spanish
[speaking foreign language]

741
00:31:22,965 --> 00:31:25,895
Dude, that sounds sexy.
What does that mean?

742
00:31:25,896 --> 00:31:29,166
It's basically
that nobody takes
your experience from you.

743
00:31:29,172 --> 00:31:31,452
And so, I'm not really
worried about anybody else,

744
00:31:31,448 --> 00:31:32,898
because I know
that our conversations

745
00:31:32,896 --> 00:31:35,066
and our connection is special.

746
00:31:35,068 --> 00:31:37,168
So, he and Soyoung,
that was... that was about

747
00:31:37,172 --> 00:31:40,552
two people who are adventurous
and would have enjoyed

748
00:31:40,551 --> 00:31:42,481
- just that, but that was...
- [Joey] Huh-huh.

749
00:31:42,482 --> 00:31:45,072
But I haven't really
seen them, like,
talk much at all... at all.

750
00:31:45,068 --> 00:31:46,898
Not like that,
not like that, nah.

751
00:31:46,896 --> 00:31:48,586
So, you all think
they're a good match...

752
00:31:48,586 --> 00:31:50,586
No, of course not, nah.

753
00:31:50,586 --> 00:31:52,236
- Really?
- No.

754
00:31:52,241 --> 00:31:55,901
And Jose is going on
a lot of dates with, you know,

755
00:31:55,896 --> 00:31:57,476
almost every woman
in the house.

756
00:31:57,482 --> 00:32:00,142
So, I'm just really wishing
that he's not a player

757
00:32:00,137 --> 00:32:02,277
and he's trying
to play my mom,

758
00:32:02,275 --> 00:32:03,995
and he's playing
Mr. Nice Guy just

759
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,100
to get everyone's attention.

760
00:32:06,103 --> 00:32:08,283
Ah, I hope
that's not the case.

761
00:32:14,482 --> 00:32:17,282
Each of the women that
I've dated here in the retreat

762
00:32:17,275 --> 00:32:19,965
has something
very, very special.

763
00:32:19,965 --> 00:32:22,855
I think the woman
that I'm connected
with the most has been...

764
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,170
You keep talking,
bro, what's the point?

765
00:32:26,172 --> 00:32:27,662
- You haven't said [bleep]
- Stop talking
while I'm talking.

766
00:32:37,103 --> 00:32:38,283
Tell me all about it.

767
00:32:38,275 --> 00:32:40,685
Did you see the shark?

768
00:32:40,689 --> 00:32:41,999
- The whale shark.
- [Pola] See.

769
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,590
Well, of course, yeah, we had
a very magical experience.

770
00:32:45,586 --> 00:32:46,966
- It was?
- [Jose] Yeah, amazing.

771
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:50,235
So, we swam a couple of times
with the whale sharks...

772
00:32:50,241 --> 00:32:51,451
Huh-huh.

773
00:32:51,448 --> 00:32:53,658
...and then out of nowhere,
we saw a humpback whale.

774
00:32:53,655 --> 00:32:55,995
No. No, no.
You didn't, you didn't.

775
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,590
Yeah, we really enjoyed
the moment a lot.

776
00:32:58,586 --> 00:33:02,166
But do you feel that chemistry
between you and her?

777
00:33:02,172 --> 00:33:03,282
She's amazing.

778
00:33:03,275 --> 00:33:05,685
She showed me a different side
of her...

779
00:33:05,689 --> 00:33:09,279
very playful side,
she laughed a lot,

780
00:33:09,275 --> 00:33:11,585
she was very funny,
was very caring.

781
00:33:11,586 --> 00:33:13,586
- I'm happy for you,
I'm happy for you.
- Thank you.

782
00:33:13,586 --> 00:33:16,546
Each of the women that
I've dated here in the retreat

783
00:33:16,551 --> 00:33:18,861
has something
very, very special,

784
00:33:18,862 --> 00:33:21,142
and I've connected
in many different ways.

785
00:33:21,137 --> 00:33:22,997
I think that the women
that I've connected

786
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,480
with the most
has been Soyoung.

787
00:33:24,482 --> 00:33:25,662
Really?

788
00:33:25,655 --> 00:33:27,165
- Yeah.
- Wow, Jose.

789
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:28,552
For sure, yeah.

790
00:33:28,551 --> 00:33:30,171
- I wasn't expecting that.
- Really?

791
00:33:30,172 --> 00:33:31,452
[Pola] Never.

792
00:33:31,448 --> 00:33:34,278
Maybe you're not clear
that it's not her,

793
00:33:34,275 --> 00:33:37,095
it's just everything
that you did with her.

794
00:33:37,103 --> 00:33:39,483
I mean, if you take her
somewhere else,

795
00:33:39,482 --> 00:33:41,482
do you think
you would be happy with her?

796
00:33:41,482 --> 00:33:42,862
I don't know.

797
00:33:42,862 --> 00:33:45,002
So, I see Jose
having great connection

798
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,480
with a lot of girls here,
even Kelle, I mean.

799
00:33:47,482 --> 00:33:51,382
But I wouldn't think he would
get a connection with Soyoung.

800
00:33:51,379 --> 00:33:55,589
<i>Soyoung is amazing,
but I see it really
as friendship.</i>

801
00:33:55,586 --> 00:33:59,756
<i>You know
who I would pick for Jose,
I really would pick Shannon.</i>

802
00:33:59,758 --> 00:34:02,098
Her conversations
are really serious,

803
00:34:02,103 --> 00:34:05,383
and I feel Jose's
conversations are the same.

804
00:34:05,379 --> 00:34:09,099
So, they have lots of things
to... to talk about.

805
00:34:09,103 --> 00:34:12,003
Do you think Shannon
will be disappointed,

806
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,690
because I'm sure
she expects to you
to be close to her again.

807
00:34:15,689 --> 00:34:19,029
I actually like Shannon a lot
and we have shared a lot.

808
00:34:19,034 --> 00:34:20,244
Yeah, I see that.

809
00:34:20,241 --> 00:34:22,451
I think it's just
a matter of...

810
00:34:22,448 --> 00:34:27,378
just waiting for that spark
to happen, and I think...

811
00:34:27,379 --> 00:34:32,069
I mean, I don't know,
it's... it's unexplainable,
it really is.

812
00:34:32,068 --> 00:34:35,068
<i>What I'm wondering right now
is that if that connection</i>

813
00:34:35,068 --> 00:34:38,478
with Soyoung was caused
from the euphoria

814
00:34:38,482 --> 00:34:43,382
of the whole experience
and not necessarily
because of her.

815
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:45,479
<i>If I went with Shannon
to that date,</i>

816
00:34:45,482 --> 00:34:49,032
would I feel the same way
about Shannon or not?

817
00:34:50,241 --> 00:34:52,481
<i>I think I need to give it
a little thought</i>

818
00:34:52,482 --> 00:34:58,242
and slow down a little bit,
because I need to see
how I'm feeling really.

819
00:34:58,241 --> 00:35:00,281
- We'll have to wait and see.
- [Pola] Let's see, let's see.

820
00:35:00,275 --> 00:35:01,655
I don't know.

821
00:35:10,793 --> 00:35:12,003
[cell phone chiming]

822
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,790
You're going to like
this one, mamas.

823
00:35:13,793 --> 00:35:19,793
Gators, get ready to go back
in time to when your moms
were your age.

824
00:35:19,793 --> 00:35:24,003
Tonight, we're going to party
like it's 1990s something.

825
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,280
[all cheering]

826
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:30,973
It's a '90s dance
party tonight,
I'm super excited.

827
00:35:32,482 --> 00:35:33,862
- [Kelle speaking]
- Yeah, yeah.

828
00:35:33,862 --> 00:35:35,902
Show me your moves.

829
00:35:35,896 --> 00:35:38,166
Oh, y'all gon' make me
take off my shoes.

830
00:35:41,379 --> 00:35:44,339
[Charlene] <i>This party is like
pre-Harrison time</i>

831
00:35:44,344 --> 00:35:47,594
and I'm just feeling
the moment of like
when I was 16.

832
00:35:52,344 --> 00:35:55,904
I think I was negative
ten years old in the '90s.

833
00:35:55,896 --> 00:35:59,166
I was still like a sperm
just sitting in the eggs.

834
00:36:03,034 --> 00:36:04,764
Wow.

835
00:36:22,103 --> 00:36:24,483
[Ryan] <i>It's beginning to get
to a point where I feel like</i>

836
00:36:25,241 --> 00:36:27,281
consistently her
and Gabriel now,

837
00:36:27,275 --> 00:36:28,855
like try to come around me
and do things

838
00:36:28,862 --> 00:36:30,902
to disrespect me,
to bother me.

839
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,380
Hey, Stef, do you mind
if I borrow you for a minute.

840
00:36:34,379 --> 00:36:36,069
- Yeah, what's up?
- Okay, cool.

841
00:36:37,896 --> 00:36:40,376
- [Ryan speaking]
- Oh.

842
00:36:40,379 --> 00:36:41,549
- [Ryan speaking]
- Oh, I know.

843
00:36:41,551 --> 00:36:43,171
- No, I'm really chilly.
- [Ryan speaking]

844
00:36:43,172 --> 00:36:45,692
No, no, it's fine.

845
00:36:45,689 --> 00:36:48,379
I need to know,
clearly, clear cut,

846
00:36:48,379 --> 00:36:51,239
like straight to the point,
where does she stand?

847
00:36:51,241 --> 00:36:55,451
Does she have a romantic
interest in me or not?

848
00:36:55,448 --> 00:36:56,898
So how do you feel?

849
00:36:56,896 --> 00:36:59,136
Hm, I feel fine,
but I just don't think

850
00:36:59,137 --> 00:37:01,167
what happened earlier
was cool.

851
00:37:01,172 --> 00:37:05,592
I'm blown away that your mom
was actually questioning me,

852
00:37:05,586 --> 00:37:08,166
and that actually
was not cool with me.

853
00:37:08,172 --> 00:37:09,792
It was never my intent
to ambush you.

854
00:37:09,793 --> 00:37:12,383
But you know what,
it makes no sense, Ryan,

855
00:37:12,379 --> 00:37:14,689
we never discussed
like we're an item.

856
00:37:14,689 --> 00:37:16,589
Just because we went
on a one date.

857
00:37:16,586 --> 00:37:17,586
- [Ryan] No.
- And we kissed.

858
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:25,785
That's your problem,
you're a liar.

859
00:37:25,793 --> 00:37:27,103
Don't be rude to her.

860
00:37:27,103 --> 00:37:28,793
Don't talk
to my girl like that.

861
00:37:28,793 --> 00:37:31,283
I think your feelings are hurt
because she doesn't like it.

862
00:37:31,275 --> 00:37:32,585
Then why did she kiss me
on the beach,

863
00:37:32,586 --> 00:37:34,026
telling me that she doesn't
[bleep] you [bleep] me.

864
00:37:40,551 --> 00:37:43,481
You know what,
it makes no sense, Ryan.

865
00:37:43,482 --> 00:37:48,142
We went out, you gave me
a kiss, I kissed you back,

866
00:37:48,137 --> 00:37:49,337
and that was it.

867
00:37:50,758 --> 00:37:53,378
And then now saying that
I'm creating drama here.

868
00:37:53,379 --> 00:37:54,589
Yes.

869
00:37:54,586 --> 00:37:56,096
How am I creating drama?

870
00:37:56,103 --> 00:38:01,283
By not telling
this dude or me,

871
00:38:01,275 --> 00:38:02,585
the straight story.

872
00:38:02,586 --> 00:38:04,066
What straight story.

873
00:38:04,068 --> 00:38:06,968
Did you tell Gabriel,
what you told me
you feel about him?

874
00:38:06,965 --> 00:38:10,895
I don't understand
why you're so fixated

875
00:38:10,896 --> 00:38:12,896
with finding out
what I talk about Gabriel?

876
00:38:12,896 --> 00:38:14,026
No, I'm...

877
00:38:14,034 --> 00:38:15,454
Who do you think,
you think I'm sitting

878
00:38:15,448 --> 00:38:17,028
over there kissing Gabriel
and telling him,

879
00:38:17,034 --> 00:38:18,454
oh, I want to date you.

880
00:38:18,448 --> 00:38:19,898
- I'm gonna be honest.
- I'm so happy...

881
00:38:19,896 --> 00:38:22,586
I don't care what y'all do,
what I care about is this.

882
00:38:22,586 --> 00:38:24,586
You clearly do,
because you're just thinking

883
00:38:24,586 --> 00:38:26,686
that's what I'm doing.

884
00:38:26,689 --> 00:38:30,239
<i>I'm here to date and see
who I have a connection with,</i>

885
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:35,171
and Ryan is pushing the issue
and moving way too fast.

886
00:38:35,172 --> 00:38:39,032
He is ruining any connection
we could have.

887
00:38:39,034 --> 00:38:43,764
I feel like you spun
me and Gabriel,
two separate stories,

888
00:38:43,758 --> 00:38:44,968
why, because he's acting...

889
00:38:44,965 --> 00:38:46,785
[Stefany] Let's bring him.
Let's bring him.

890
00:38:46,793 --> 00:38:48,003
- [Ryan] You want that?
- Yeah.

891
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,140
- [Ryan] Bring him.
- Let's go.

892
00:38:49,482 --> 00:38:50,592
Bring him.

893
00:38:50,586 --> 00:38:52,996
Stefany, I don't think
she's told Gabriel

894
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,550
that she's not interested
in him romantically,

895
00:38:55,551 --> 00:38:57,381
because I think
she likes the attention.

896
00:38:57,379 --> 00:39:00,689
He's just making it seem
like I'm playing
both of you, basically.

897
00:39:00,689 --> 00:39:02,789
- Oh.
- [Gabriel] You wanted to talk?

898
00:39:02,793 --> 00:39:04,453
- What is the problem here?
- I don't understand it.

899
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:07,448
For starters, I did not ask
to have a talk
with the two of you.

900
00:39:07,448 --> 00:39:08,788
I asked to have a talk
with Stefany...

901
00:39:08,793 --> 00:39:10,173
Bro, can you just
get to the point?

902
00:39:10,172 --> 00:39:12,032
I don't get it, it's like
you keep saying...

903
00:39:12,034 --> 00:39:13,454
I'm as tired as,
one more time to keep

904
00:39:13,448 --> 00:39:14,658
this bullshit [bleep]
going on.

905
00:39:14,655 --> 00:39:16,095
This is so funny.

906
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:17,903
Bro, what the [bleep]
you keep talking, bro,
what's the point,

907
00:39:17,896 --> 00:39:19,096
you haven't said [bleep]

908
00:39:19,103 --> 00:39:20,763
Stop talking
while I'm talking.

909
00:39:24,896 --> 00:39:26,136
Can I just say something
real quick?

910
00:39:26,137 --> 00:39:27,167
Sure.

911
00:39:27,172 --> 00:39:29,592
Bro, Stefany
and I have been vibing,

912
00:39:29,586 --> 00:39:32,476
you're the only one causing
a problem here, to be real.

913
00:39:32,482 --> 00:39:35,032
To be honest with you,
it takes more than one person
to call it a problem.

914
00:39:35,034 --> 00:39:36,904
- I...
- But, Stefany...

915
00:39:36,896 --> 00:39:38,276
like, have we been good?

916
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:39,785
I didn't ask you to ask her.

917
00:39:39,793 --> 00:39:41,863
We didn't have one fight
until Ryan started, like, getting...

918
00:39:41,862 --> 00:39:44,002
- I think because I went out...
- You didn't ask me to ask her.

919
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,690
- ...on a date with him, he...
- I didn't ask you to ask her,
when you asked me.

920
00:39:46,689 --> 00:39:48,999
- It's like if you want advice
to, like...
- I don't want your advice.

921
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
- ...kind of like talk to her.
- I don't want your advice.

922
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,030
- Bro, I'll [bleep]
help you, like...
- You're not getting it.

923
00:39:53,034 --> 00:39:55,174
Bro, you can take her
on a date, I don't...
we're not dating.

924
00:39:55,172 --> 00:39:57,282
Brother, brother,
you're missing the point.

925
00:39:57,275 --> 00:39:59,965
Stefany is her own woman,
it's like her and I...

926
00:39:59,965 --> 00:40:01,585
we don't even know
if it's romantic yet

927
00:40:01,586 --> 00:40:03,786
or something,
we're just vibing.

928
00:40:03,793 --> 00:40:05,793
And then she's telling me
you made a bet with her,

929
00:40:05,793 --> 00:40:07,483
like, oh, if you don't wake up
at 5:00 a.m.,

930
00:40:07,482 --> 00:40:09,452
you can't be around Gabriel
for 24 hours.

931
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:11,658
It's like, what even
is that bet, bro?

932
00:40:11,655 --> 00:40:13,095
That's your problem,
you're a liar.

933
00:40:13,103 --> 00:40:14,383
I'm a liar?

934
00:40:15,896 --> 00:40:18,996
She lied earlier about even
telling you about our bet.

935
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,690
I don't even know
why you're trying to like...

936
00:40:20,689 --> 00:40:22,209
- Exactly.
- ...get in our business.

937
00:40:22,206 --> 00:40:24,166
- I don't care about
your thing, my point is...
- Sit down, sit down.

938
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:27,102
My point is, I don't have time
for people to come,
in my atmosphere...

939
00:40:27,103 --> 00:40:28,973
- I think... I think...
- ...with lies and...

940
00:40:28,965 --> 00:40:30,165
You know what, Ryan.
Ryan... no.

941
00:40:30,172 --> 00:40:31,622
Then go home bro,
I'm done with this.

942
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:33,690
You're calling her a liar,
bro, why are you being
so rude to her.

943
00:40:33,689 --> 00:40:35,689
- Yeah, you're...
- 'Cause you just lied
about what you said.

944
00:40:35,689 --> 00:40:37,449
- You know what...
- Why are you being
so rude to her?

945
00:40:37,448 --> 00:40:38,758
- ...you need...
- Don't be rude to her.

946
00:40:38,758 --> 00:40:41,278
I like Stefany, like,
don't talk to my girl
like that.

947
00:40:41,275 --> 00:40:43,545
<i>I definitely think Ryan
ruined his chance</i>

948
00:40:43,551 --> 00:40:45,141
<i>with Stefany acting like that.</i>

949
00:40:45,137 --> 00:40:46,897
I think she wants
a mature guy.

950
00:40:48,172 --> 00:40:49,482
[clicks tongue]

951
00:40:49,482 --> 00:40:52,172
I think your feelings are hurt
because she doesn't like you.

952
00:40:52,172 --> 00:40:53,692
Then why did she kissed me
on the beach,

953
00:40:53,689 --> 00:40:55,899
telling me that she doesn't
[bleep] would you want
to [bleep] me.

954
00:40:55,896 --> 00:40:57,586
[Stefany] You know what,
you're so narcissistic.

955
00:40:57,586 --> 00:40:59,756
Yeah, I had a... yeah. Yeah.

956
00:40:59,758 --> 00:41:01,898
[Ryan] And when the lie
comes out,
then that's what we do.

957
00:41:01,896 --> 00:41:05,376
I hate all of this drama,
we went on one date,

958
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:08,589
I kissed him
one time, that's it.

959
00:41:08,586 --> 00:41:11,686
I think Gabriel and I have
a really strong connection,

960
00:41:11,689 --> 00:41:13,589
<i>and that's
what's most important.</i>

961
00:41:13,586 --> 00:41:14,896
Ryan,
you are so disrespectful.

962
00:41:14,896 --> 00:41:16,096
You... you channeled this.

963
00:41:16,103 --> 00:41:17,693
You're a liar,
and that's bogus.

964
00:41:17,689 --> 00:41:19,239
You 45 years,
you are too old
to be doing it.

965
00:41:19,241 --> 00:41:21,481
- Okay, now I'm too old
to be dealing with this.
- No, no, you...

966
00:41:21,482 --> 00:41:24,172
so you're going to walk out
with 23-year-old that
you just said...

967
00:41:24,172 --> 00:41:25,692
- My room's upstairs.
- Get out of here bro.

968
00:41:25,689 --> 00:41:27,069
[Stefany] He is crazy.

969
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:28,898
I know, I'm coming
straight like that
because it's ridiculous.

970
00:41:28,896 --> 00:41:30,066
- He's so crazy.
- It's ridiculous.

971
00:41:30,068 --> 00:41:31,278
I lied to him,
okay, whatever.

972
00:41:31,275 --> 00:41:32,375
His... his feelings are hurt.

973
00:41:32,379 --> 00:41:34,339
[Stefany] Yeah.

974
00:41:34,344 --> 00:41:36,384
At this point,
I'm over it, but I just know

975
00:41:36,379 --> 00:41:39,339
what works for me
and what doesn't work for me.

976
00:41:39,344 --> 00:41:42,284
And Stefany
doesn't work for me.

977
00:41:46,586 --> 00:41:48,166
How good are you
with your hands,

978
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:50,342
it's time for the woman
to judge that.

979
00:41:52,448 --> 00:41:53,478
[Lisa] Yes.

980
00:41:53,482 --> 00:41:55,592
Oh, perfect pressure.

981
00:41:55,586 --> 00:41:59,236
<i>There's nothing hotter,
to be massaged</i>

982
00:41:59,241 --> 00:42:01,901
by eight young men.

983
00:42:01,896 --> 00:42:04,276
[groans]

984
00:42:04,275 --> 00:42:06,065
I think I'm massaging
my mom's back.

985
00:42:06,068 --> 00:42:07,758
That's it, right there baby.

986
00:42:07,758 --> 00:42:09,338
I kind of want
to throw up a little bit.

987
00:42:09,344 --> 00:42:13,144
From your standpoint,
like, what turned you on
about women?

988
00:42:13,137 --> 00:42:15,897
Hmm, let's see
what turns me on the most.

989
00:42:15,896 --> 00:42:17,586
<i>I'm gonna be real,
I'm a little nervous,</i>

990
00:42:17,586 --> 00:42:19,686
because Charlene's
a little bit aggressive.

991
00:42:19,689 --> 00:42:22,479
- I like to, you know...
- Yeah.

992
00:42:22,482 --> 00:42:24,662
I've never experienced
something like this.

993
00:42:26,103 --> 00:42:30,973
I have a plan for tonight,
but we would have
to sneak out.

994
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:33,475
[Kelle] <i>I know that Jose</i>
has been dating a lot of women

995
00:42:33,482 --> 00:42:36,342
<i>in the house, but tonight
I'm going to show him</i>

996
00:42:36,344 --> 00:42:37,794
that I'm the one
he should be with.
