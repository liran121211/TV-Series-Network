1
00:00:15,862 --> 00:00:19,452
<i>My name is April Jane,
and I am in my 50s.</i>

2
00:00:19,448 --> 00:00:22,718
I'm a vintage, rare find.

3
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:27,169
<i>I live in Studio City,
California,</i>

4
00:00:27,172 --> 00:00:31,452
<i>and I have three
amazing boys.</i>

5
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:33,308
<i>I don't think
any of my sons realize</i>

6
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:35,690
that I have
an extremely high libido.

7
00:00:35,689 --> 00:00:37,029
<i>Hold on.</i>

8
00:00:37,034 --> 00:00:38,174
Is that too much saying

9
00:00:38,172 --> 00:00:39,522
I have an extremely
high libido?

10
00:00:39,517 --> 00:00:41,377
Should I just have said
high libido?

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,830
<i>My marriage was wonderful
for a while.</i>

12
00:00:46,827 --> 00:00:48,517
We got together
when we were very young.

13
00:00:48,517 --> 00:00:50,337
I am seven years
older than him.

14
00:00:50,344 --> 00:00:51,624
<i>We just realized that</i>

15
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,790
<i>we weren't completely
compatible.</i>

16
00:00:54,793 --> 00:00:56,483
<i>I thought I had
my whole life planned,</i>

17
00:00:56,482 --> 00:00:59,382
but now I'm here,
open to the adventure.

18
00:00:59,379 --> 00:01:01,099
<i>I'm open to having
a connection</i>

19
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:02,623
<i>with another younger man.</i>

20
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,030
I hope I'm really gonna
find love.

21
00:01:05,034 --> 00:01:06,724
[sighs]

22
00:01:09,551 --> 00:01:10,721
[Pola] <i>My name is Pola.</i>

23
00:01:10,724 --> 00:01:12,694
I am originally
from Mexico City,

24
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:15,239
but right now I live in Miami,
in a paradise.

25
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,901
- Hi.
- Hi.

26
00:01:16,896 --> 00:01:18,406
- How are you?
- I'm good.

27
00:01:18,413 --> 00:01:19,833
My name is Pola.
Nice to meet you.

28
00:01:19,827 --> 00:01:22,097
Hi, Pola.
Nice to meet you, too. April.

29
00:01:22,103 --> 00:01:23,693
[Pola] April.
Nice to meet you. Pleasure.

30
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:26,279
I'm expecting
for some guys to walk up

31
00:01:26,275 --> 00:01:27,585
and introduce themselves.

32
00:01:27,586 --> 00:01:30,406
And here comes Pola.

33
00:01:30,413 --> 00:01:31,593
And it surprised me.

34
00:01:31,586 --> 00:01:33,306
- Nice to meet you, Pola.
- [Pola] Welcome to Mexico.

35
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,450
Thank you.

36
00:01:34,448 --> 00:01:36,828
I'm not necessarily
a competitive person,

37
00:01:36,827 --> 00:01:38,717
but I'm confident,

38
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:41,594
and she doesn't have
anything on me.

39
00:01:41,586 --> 00:01:43,406
- [Pola] Where are you from?
- I'm from Los Angeles.

40
00:01:43,413 --> 00:01:45,213
- [Pola] Oh, that's nice.
- Such pretty eyes.

41
00:01:45,206 --> 00:01:46,406
- You like Mexico?
- I love it.

42
00:01:46,413 --> 00:01:47,833
- It's beautiful, right?
- It's gorgeous.

43
00:01:47,827 --> 00:01:48,997
- Yes.
- It is gorgeous.

44
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,100
When I was 23 years old,

45
00:01:51,103 --> 00:01:54,033
<i>my husband passed away
in a car accident.</i>

46
00:01:54,034 --> 00:01:55,764
<i>It was really hard,</i>

47
00:01:55,758 --> 00:01:58,338
<i>but I wanted a good life
for my kids,</i>

48
00:01:58,344 --> 00:02:01,624
so I decided I was gonna
live my life happily,

49
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,480
make good memories
with my kids,

50
00:02:03,482 --> 00:02:05,342
and just move forward.

51
00:02:05,344 --> 00:02:07,174
- Salud.
- Salud.

52
00:02:08,448 --> 00:02:10,448
I'm totally ready
to take that risk

53
00:02:10,448 --> 00:02:11,858
and find that special guy.

54
00:02:13,172 --> 00:02:14,482
I'm that kind of woman

55
00:02:14,482 --> 00:02:16,342
that really likes
to be around a man.

56
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:17,904
I've never been by myself.

57
00:02:17,896 --> 00:02:20,686
Like, in kindergarten,
I had boyfriends.

58
00:02:20,689 --> 00:02:23,829
Like, I've always been
around someone special.

59
00:02:23,827 --> 00:02:26,997
<i>So if someone proposed
while I'm here,</i>

60
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,410
that would be great news.

61
00:02:28,413 --> 00:02:32,003
I don't know what...
if it's gonna happen or not,
but let's see.

62
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,520
So what do you do in LA?

63
00:02:33,517 --> 00:02:34,587
- I'm a singer.
- Oh, really?

64
00:02:34,586 --> 00:02:35,856
Can I ask you your age?

65
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,410
- No, you can't. No.
- [laughs]

66
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,550
<i>My name is Soyoung.</i>

67
00:02:41,551 --> 00:02:43,691
<i>I am 50 years old.</i>

68
00:02:43,689 --> 00:02:46,519
When I meet good-looking,
my type of a man,

69
00:02:46,517 --> 00:02:47,997
I'll introduce myself and say,

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,070
"Hey, I'm Soyoung
and I'm so [bleep]."

71
00:02:52,482 --> 00:02:53,832
- [Pola] Hi.
- How are you?

72
00:02:53,827 --> 00:02:54,967
Hey! How are you?

73
00:02:54,965 --> 00:02:56,445
[April Jane] Good.
How are you?

74
00:02:56,448 --> 00:02:57,998
- [Pola] Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

75
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,170
I'm Soyoung.

76
00:02:59,172 --> 00:03:00,342
- [April Jane] Soyoung?
- Yes.

77
00:03:00,344 --> 00:03:02,554
I always dated a young guy.

78
00:03:02,551 --> 00:03:04,171
My second husband
was younger.

79
00:03:04,172 --> 00:03:05,762
<i>All my boyfriends was young.</i>

80
00:03:05,758 --> 00:03:08,478
<i>Always ten years younger.
I'm a fire love.</i>

81
00:03:08,482 --> 00:03:11,722
I have to have those fire,
love to have sex.

82
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:14,694
If I don't have that,
I could have sex,

83
00:03:14,689 --> 00:03:18,169
but I can't kiss anybody
because that's disgusting.

84
00:03:18,172 --> 00:03:19,382
[April Jane]
Where are you from?

85
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:20,549
I'm originally
from South Korea.

86
00:03:20,551 --> 00:03:21,761
- [April Jane] Oh, are you?
- Yeah.

87
00:03:21,758 --> 00:03:23,168
- [Pola] Oh, I love--
- [April Jane] Nice.

88
00:03:23,172 --> 00:03:24,722
How old were you
when you moved out?

89
00:03:24,724 --> 00:03:26,004
How many years ago
did you move to--

90
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,550
That's when I was 19,
18 and a half. So yeah.

91
00:03:29,551 --> 00:03:32,031
- Adventurous.
- Yeah, I am.

92
00:03:32,034 --> 00:03:34,484
Like, I'm not afraid
of things, like anything.

93
00:03:34,482 --> 00:03:36,072
How about of this?

94
00:03:36,068 --> 00:03:37,548
Yes. Just like this.

95
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:38,791
[chuckles]

96
00:03:38,793 --> 00:03:39,973
[Pola] <i>Soyoung is cute.</i>

97
00:03:39,965 --> 00:03:41,305
I'm sure
she's gonna get picked

98
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,760
with many other guys,

99
00:03:42,758 --> 00:03:46,138
<i>but if she likes
the same guy that I do like,</i>

100
00:03:46,137 --> 00:03:47,967
<i>I will be competitive. And...</i>

101
00:03:47,965 --> 00:03:50,065
[Pola speaking]

102
00:03:50,068 --> 00:03:51,718
I don't care about
any other thing.

103
00:03:51,724 --> 00:03:52,974
I want to win.

104
00:03:52,965 --> 00:03:54,135
We're gonna start the day.

105
00:03:54,137 --> 00:03:55,237
- Nice meeting you.
- Yay!

106
00:03:55,241 --> 00:03:56,661
- Nice to meet you.
- Woo-hoo!

107
00:03:58,034 --> 00:03:59,694
<i>My name is April.
I'm 43 years old.</i>

108
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:01,099
<i>I'm from Detroit, Michigan.</i>

109
00:04:01,103 --> 00:04:03,143
I'm a very simple girl.

110
00:04:03,137 --> 00:04:04,927
I married
my high school sweetheart.

111
00:04:04,931 --> 00:04:06,621
I met him at 14.

112
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,310
<i>We had our children together</i>

113
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,550
<i>and we were married
for 14 years.</i>

114
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:13,791
So that has been my really
longest relationship.

115
00:04:13,793 --> 00:04:14,933
- [April] Hi!
- [Pola] Hola.

116
00:04:14,931 --> 00:04:16,381
[April]
You guys look so pretty.

117
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:19,719
- I'm April.
- April, I'm April.

118
00:04:19,724 --> 00:04:21,244
- There's two Aprils.
- [laughter]

119
00:04:21,241 --> 00:04:22,411
Right.

120
00:04:22,413 --> 00:04:24,903
I gave a lot of my youth
to raising my boys.

121
00:04:24,896 --> 00:04:28,276
<i>Now, at 43, I'm just looking
to have fun.</i>

122
00:04:28,275 --> 00:04:30,615
And I want
to date younger men

123
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,900
because a lot of guys
that are older,

124
00:04:32,896 --> 00:04:34,656
they're like in "papa mode",

125
00:04:34,655 --> 00:04:36,715
and I want to get a chance
to do me a little.

126
00:04:36,724 --> 00:04:39,414
So when it's time for me
to be grandma, like I'm ready.

127
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:40,663
I'm just not ready now.

128
00:04:45,655 --> 00:04:47,615
Ladies,
where's all the men at?

129
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,620
Are you kidding me?
You guys look great.

130
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,030
Hi.

131
00:04:51,034 --> 00:04:52,144
My name is Charlene.

132
00:04:52,137 --> 00:04:53,307
I'm from Jersey,

133
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,280
but currently I live in
Los Angeles, Hollywood.

134
00:04:56,275 --> 00:04:58,065
- Hi.
- [April] What did you say
your name was again?

135
00:04:58,068 --> 00:04:59,408
- Charlene.
- Charlene. Right.

136
00:04:59,413 --> 00:05:01,523
Yeah. I think it's my time
to find love.

137
00:05:01,517 --> 00:05:02,997
I really do.

138
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
<i>Because life has,
you know, really given me
some curveballs,</i>

139
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,900
and it took a long time
to get here.

140
00:05:09,896 --> 00:05:12,206
It's so nice to meet
new people, so, you know.

141
00:05:12,206 --> 00:05:14,066
So I'm wearing
two necklaces today.

142
00:05:14,068 --> 00:05:16,518
The first one
is an infinity necklace
that my daughter,

143
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:18,617
Ashley, got for me.

144
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,280
And she's my oldest daughter.

145
00:05:20,275 --> 00:05:22,685
She would be 28 right now.

146
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,929
She just had her birthday,
but she passed away

147
00:05:24,931 --> 00:05:26,141
when she was 27.

148
00:05:27,379 --> 00:05:29,169
<i>So it's not even been
a year yet.</i>

149
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:33,139
<i>Losing her was by far
the hardest thing</i>

150
00:05:33,137 --> 00:05:35,757
I've ever had to do,
and I'm doing it.

151
00:05:35,758 --> 00:05:37,278
That's the thing.
I'm doing it.

152
00:05:38,689 --> 00:05:42,139
My daughter was huge
in my life about dating.

153
00:05:42,137 --> 00:05:44,447
<i>She'd be the first person
I would talk to.</i>

154
00:05:44,448 --> 00:05:46,548
The first person I would ask.

155
00:05:46,551 --> 00:05:48,001
[Charlene]
Are we looking for love,

156
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,170
are we looking for romance?

157
00:05:49,172 --> 00:05:50,482
[April Jane]
I'm looking for love?

158
00:05:50,482 --> 00:05:52,662
[Charlene]
I mean, look, it's like
love is in the air here.

159
00:05:52,655 --> 00:05:54,445
- It's so...
- it's romantic.

160
00:05:54,448 --> 00:05:55,658
It is romantic.

161
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:58,655
I am doing this for Ashley
in a lot of ways

162
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:01,205
<i>because I think she wants me
to be happy.</i>

163
00:06:01,206 --> 00:06:02,656
I know she would want me
to be in love.

164
00:06:02,655 --> 00:06:03,825
Like, hey, that's the hope.

165
00:06:03,827 --> 00:06:04,967
Could I fall in love?

166
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:07,755
Could I get married
and come out of the dark like,

167
00:06:07,758 --> 00:06:10,858
you know, a new chapter,
light on the horizon.

168
00:06:10,862 --> 00:06:12,902
But it's been so long,
I don't know.

169
00:06:12,896 --> 00:06:14,096
[Charlene]
I never know how...

170
00:06:14,103 --> 00:06:15,723
how and why I'm gonna be
attracted to someone,

171
00:06:15,724 --> 00:06:17,344
like their personality
to me, it can be more--

172
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:18,794
[Pola]
That's much more important.

173
00:06:18,793 --> 00:06:20,933
[Charlene] Sometimes,
like really good-looking guys,
they're so...

174
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:22,901
- [April Jane]
They open their mouth...
- [Charlene] Yeah.

175
00:06:22,896 --> 00:06:24,756
- Yeah,
I was gonna say that.
- [Charlene] It's not...

176
00:06:24,758 --> 00:06:28,238
How about the guy
that are ugly and...
but he has a nice personality,

177
00:06:28,241 --> 00:06:29,521
nice to you,
you're gonna date?

178
00:06:29,517 --> 00:06:30,617
[Charlene] No,
no, no, no, no.

179
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,520
[April Jane] No,
no, no, no, no.

180
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:36,827
I'm Kelle. I'm 50 years old,
and my alter ego
is Disco Mommy.

181
00:06:36,827 --> 00:06:38,547
Hey, girls!

182
00:06:38,551 --> 00:06:40,241
- [Pola] Hey!
- [Soyoung] Hello!

183
00:06:40,241 --> 00:06:42,521
[Kelle] How are you
hot ladies doing?

184
00:06:42,517 --> 00:06:45,547
<i>Disco Mommy loves house music
and Disco Mommy,</i>

185
00:06:45,551 --> 00:06:48,721
she's really spontaneous.
She's just fun.

186
00:06:48,724 --> 00:06:51,104
What can I get
you ladies to drink?

187
00:06:51,103 --> 00:06:52,593
Do we need a shot?

188
00:06:52,586 --> 00:06:54,546
[all laughing]

189
00:06:54,551 --> 00:06:56,281
Kelle has a big personality.

190
00:06:56,275 --> 00:06:57,855
Don't play with me.

191
00:06:57,862 --> 00:07:02,482
I do think that, for me,
it's really too much.

192
00:07:02,482 --> 00:07:04,622
She's just got to pare it back
just a little bit.

193
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,620
One, two, three, four.

194
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:10,760
All these women look amazingly
hot, but they're not me.

195
00:07:10,758 --> 00:07:12,338
Always good vibes.

196
00:07:12,344 --> 00:07:16,624
I have six amazing kids,
three girls and three boys,

197
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,310
<i>and I feel like
I've been judged</i>

198
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:21,590
by having multiple kids
from not having the same dad.

199
00:07:21,586 --> 00:07:24,546
In fact, that's
the number one question
people ask me, like...

200
00:07:24,551 --> 00:07:26,001
like, "From the same guy?"

201
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,550
I'm like, "No, why would
I have six kids
from the same guy?

202
00:07:28,551 --> 00:07:29,761
Hello."

203
00:07:29,758 --> 00:07:31,068
You're a bad influence
already, girl.

204
00:07:31,068 --> 00:07:32,448
No, I'm an amazing influence
for sure.

205
00:07:32,448 --> 00:07:33,928
[Shannan] Yeah, you are.

206
00:07:33,931 --> 00:07:37,071
I think it's gonna be
a little bit hard to keep up
with Kelle.

207
00:07:37,068 --> 00:07:40,828
She's gonna be the party girl
in this house.

208
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:42,277
- A good influence.
- To good influence.

209
00:07:42,275 --> 00:07:43,475
Cheers, ladies. Go.

210
00:07:43,482 --> 00:07:45,592
[Kelle] <i>Well, I used to think
that age was an issue</i>

211
00:07:45,586 --> 00:07:48,756
until the first guy I dated
out of my marriage, right?

212
00:07:48,758 --> 00:07:50,688
And he was like
14 years younger.

213
00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:52,619
And then it became like
kind of a theme

214
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,340
that all these younger guys
I kept like hanging out
with and dating,

215
00:07:56,344 --> 00:07:58,934
and we literally had
the best time.

216
00:07:58,931 --> 00:08:01,031
And they taught me that,
you know,

217
00:08:01,034 --> 00:08:03,664
they could be drawn
to an older woman.

218
00:08:03,655 --> 00:08:06,545
<i>And then I realized
I can teach younger men
a lot of things.</i>

219
00:08:06,551 --> 00:08:09,831
[producer speaking]

220
00:08:09,827 --> 00:08:11,687
I don't know if I can say
that on TV.

221
00:08:11,689 --> 00:08:13,409
[laughing]

222
00:08:13,413 --> 00:08:14,793
[Shannan]
Were you married before?

223
00:08:14,793 --> 00:08:16,763
I was married ten years.

224
00:08:16,758 --> 00:08:18,408
[Shannan] So how is dating
going for you now?

225
00:08:18,413 --> 00:08:20,033
Do younger guys gravitate
toward you?

226
00:08:20,034 --> 00:08:21,834
- [Kelle] Yes.
- [Shannan]
Because you look so amazing.

227
00:08:21,827 --> 00:08:23,377
- Yes. Thank you.
- [Shannan] Yeah. Yeah.

228
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:26,479
[April] <i>Kelle is the most
risque of all the moms</i>

229
00:08:26,482 --> 00:08:28,412
with no shame whatsoever.

230
00:08:28,413 --> 00:08:30,283
I'm not mad about my body.

231
00:08:30,275 --> 00:08:32,685
[laughter]

232
00:08:32,689 --> 00:08:36,899
[Charlene] I already feel
I'm the woman that will get
the least attention.

233
00:08:36,896 --> 00:08:39,236
<i>You could tell Kelle
has invested a lot of time</i>

234
00:08:39,241 --> 00:08:40,831
<i>into her body,
her sex appeal.</i>

235
00:08:40,827 --> 00:08:42,587
<i>And I know that
young men want that.</i>

236
00:08:42,586 --> 00:08:45,756
So she's got that
going for herself.

237
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:47,758
I have the best trainer
in Orange County,

238
00:08:47,758 --> 00:08:50,138
- so if you guys want to come.
- Right.

239
00:08:50,137 --> 00:08:51,517
[Charlene]
<i>Everyone's very pretty</i>

240
00:08:51,517 --> 00:08:53,377
<i>and I'm like
the biggest girl here.</i>

241
00:08:53,379 --> 00:08:55,239
Like, what do I have to offer?

242
00:08:55,241 --> 00:08:57,001
[Charlene] You know,
we're getting older, ladies.

243
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,070
We're not getting younger,
even though we can think
that we can do things

244
00:09:00,068 --> 00:09:02,238
to make ourselves look
younger, we're really not.

245
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:03,451
We're really not.

246
00:09:03,448 --> 00:09:05,098
<i>Marina Charlene is...</i>

247
00:09:05,103 --> 00:09:08,383
she probably was very hot
when she was younger,

248
00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:10,029
um, more in shape.

249
00:09:10,034 --> 00:09:12,624
<i>I just feel like
she doesn't know</i>

250
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,380
how to glam herself up.

251
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:17,139
I think she's just
a little worried about

252
00:09:17,137 --> 00:09:21,027
not being pleasing
in that way to the guys.

253
00:09:21,034 --> 00:09:22,554
I was asking them
what they do and then,

254
00:09:22,551 --> 00:09:24,311
now I'm thinking we should
try to guess what you--

255
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,000
[April] Just guess
what you do.

256
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,380
- I feel like you do something
like with human resources.
- She's like corporate--

257
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:30,759
- Yes, I was just
gonna say that.
- Yeah. Yeah, right?

258
00:09:30,758 --> 00:09:32,548
I plan corporate events
and meetings.

259
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:34,071
- You're an event planner?
- [Shannan] Yes.

260
00:09:34,068 --> 00:09:35,208
<i>I enjoy my work.</i>

261
00:09:35,206 --> 00:09:37,066
I have had the opportunity
to travel the world,

262
00:09:37,068 --> 00:09:39,828
<i>but I wasn't always
a corporate events planner.</i>

263
00:09:39,827 --> 00:09:42,447
<i>I looked like the B-girl back
in the day
on the street corners</i>

264
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:45,588
<i>doing the break dance
and then the pop and lock
and on the cardboard.</i>

265
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:47,376
<i>So I like to have fun,
you know?</i>

266
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:48,859
And I think
that most young men

267
00:09:48,862 --> 00:09:50,312
could probably
appreciate that,

268
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:54,410
that I'm not stiff
and, you know,
or corny or prude.

269
00:09:54,413 --> 00:09:56,553
Have you guys been dating
during COVID?

270
00:09:56,551 --> 00:09:57,621
[Shannan]
Have you been dating?

271
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,480
- I haven't been.
- Not since.

272
00:09:59,482 --> 00:10:01,102
[Stefany] Well, I'm open,
you know,

273
00:10:01,103 --> 00:10:03,313
it's just
whatever God has, I guess.

274
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,590
- Amen to that.
- Right?

275
00:10:04,586 --> 00:10:06,206
Whatever God's plan is.
It's actually really--

276
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:07,756
It's probably
why we're all here right now.

277
00:10:07,758 --> 00:10:09,278
- [Stefany] Yes.
- Just seeing what's going on.

278
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,445
Exactly.

279
00:10:10,448 --> 00:10:13,338
I've always been,
you know, a believer.

280
00:10:13,344 --> 00:10:17,664
<i>I love the Lord,
and I think it's important
with relationships.</i>

281
00:10:17,655 --> 00:10:21,895
I think your partner,
having God as the foundation
is very important.

282
00:10:21,896 --> 00:10:24,376
You know, I feel like
a lot of older guys

283
00:10:24,379 --> 00:10:26,829
don't want a commitment
because they're getting out
of a divorce.

284
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:28,587
- That is so funny.
- I was thinking
the same thing.

285
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,586
So they... they just want to
play the field a little bit.

286
00:10:30,586 --> 00:10:32,026
And you're like,
"Yeah, it's time for--"

287
00:10:32,034 --> 00:10:33,214
It's like, bro,
you're like 60.

288
00:10:33,206 --> 00:10:35,926
Yeah. And you look like
you're 80, like come on.

289
00:10:35,931 --> 00:10:37,721
And then you still want
to play the field?

290
00:10:37,724 --> 00:10:39,414
Like, go, bye.

291
00:10:39,413 --> 00:10:44,073
I am excited to see
what God has in store for me

292
00:10:44,068 --> 00:10:47,098
and we'll see what happens
on this amazing journey.

293
00:10:47,103 --> 00:10:48,553
I'm so thrilled.

294
00:10:48,551 --> 00:10:49,791
[Stefany]
Wait, girls, hold on.

295
00:10:49,793 --> 00:10:51,863
- I got a text. It says...
- Oh, yeah?

296
00:10:51,862 --> 00:10:53,662
It says,
"Welcome to the villa.

297
00:10:53,655 --> 00:10:56,515
You're about to embark
on a dating experience
like none other."

298
00:10:56,517 --> 00:10:57,827
[all] Oh!

299
00:10:57,827 --> 00:11:01,517
We all received phones so that
we could receive text messages

300
00:11:01,517 --> 00:11:03,657
telling us what we're gonna do
in the villa.

301
00:11:03,655 --> 00:11:06,515
<i>I'm a little excited,
but also nervous</i>

302
00:11:06,517 --> 00:11:09,027
because we have no idea
what to expect.

303
00:11:10,896 --> 00:11:12,926
"Please head to the house
where you will meet

304
00:11:12,931 --> 00:11:14,381
the new men in your life."

305
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:16,659
- [cheering]
- [Stefany] Let's go.

306
00:11:16,655 --> 00:11:18,305
- Vamanos.
- All right.

307
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,620
<i>I'm so excited to meet
with these guys</i>

308
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:24,210
because I know that these guys
are going to be younger.

309
00:11:24,206 --> 00:11:26,516
<i>I have a very young,
free spirit,</i>

310
00:11:26,517 --> 00:11:29,967
and I connect to younger men,
especially in the bedroom.

311
00:11:32,896 --> 00:11:35,336
[Soyoung] <i>All my life,
I've been looking for tall,</i>

312
00:11:35,344 --> 00:11:41,104
dark hair, blue eyes,
nice abs, thick thighs.

313
00:11:41,103 --> 00:11:42,693
<i>Hopefully he's here.</i>

314
00:11:42,689 --> 00:11:44,519
<i>If not there,
out there anyone,</i>

315
00:11:44,517 --> 00:11:46,687
please call me, Soyoung.

316
00:11:52,482 --> 00:11:55,172
[man 1] <i>My special woman
has to be older,</i>

317
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:58,692
<i>and I'm here in Paradise
hoping to find my soulmate.</i>

318
00:12:02,068 --> 00:12:03,998
[man 2] <i>I am so excited
to come on this retreat</i>

319
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,590
<i>and just meet
a ton of beautiful women</i>

320
00:12:06,586 --> 00:12:07,756
<i>that are mature</i>

321
00:12:07,758 --> 00:12:09,408
<i>and comfortable
with themselves.</i>

322
00:12:11,724 --> 00:12:14,214
[man 3] <i>I love older women
that can keep up with me</i>

323
00:12:14,206 --> 00:12:15,856
<i>because I'm bringing
that young energy.</i>

324
00:12:15,862 --> 00:12:17,032
<i>I'm looking for love.</i>

325
00:12:17,034 --> 00:12:18,414
<i>I need a grown woman
out here.</i>

326
00:12:18,413 --> 00:12:19,903
<i>Let's go.</i>

327
00:12:19,896 --> 00:12:21,546
[Kelle] Here we go.
Here we go.

328
00:12:24,551 --> 00:12:26,661
- Whoa!
- [Shannan] Yeah!

329
00:12:26,655 --> 00:12:28,235
All right, now.

330
00:12:28,241 --> 00:12:29,451
Grrr.

331
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:31,588
[Charlene] <i>So curious
as to what I can find here.</i>

332
00:12:31,586 --> 00:12:32,856
<i>I mean, this is it.</i>

333
00:12:32,862 --> 00:12:35,172
All of my moments
have led me to this one.

334
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:37,692
And hopefully
there is somebody here

335
00:12:37,689 --> 00:12:39,859
that is gonna be
interested in me.

336
00:12:39,862 --> 00:12:41,212
I could be
interested in them.

337
00:12:44,793 --> 00:12:46,243
What's going on?

338
00:12:46,241 --> 00:12:47,931
Wait. They're our moms?

339
00:12:47,931 --> 00:12:49,451
Holy [bleep].

340
00:13:00,172 --> 00:13:01,592
[April] Whoo!

341
00:13:03,137 --> 00:13:04,477
That's my mom right there.

342
00:13:06,103 --> 00:13:07,383
[Jose speaking

343
00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:08,969
[Pola speaking

344
00:13:08,965 --> 00:13:10,095
Oh, my God!

345
00:13:10,103 --> 00:13:12,623
I just saw straight
to Jose's eyes

346
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:17,070
and just stayed there
for a couple of seconds
and say, "What is this?"

347
00:13:18,758 --> 00:13:20,378
I am really confused
right now.

348
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:22,099
What is really happening here?

349
00:13:22,103 --> 00:13:25,243
[Harrison speaking]

350
00:13:25,241 --> 00:13:26,791
[Charlene] I'm, like,
completely shocked.

351
00:13:26,793 --> 00:13:29,523
I see my son
back there and it's like,

352
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:30,927
"Who are all these guys?"

353
00:13:32,655 --> 00:13:34,475
[Billy] <i>So</i>[bleep] <i>cool.</i>

354
00:13:34,482 --> 00:13:36,762
We're supposed to date
the other moms?

355
00:13:36,758 --> 00:13:37,968
Uh...

356
00:13:37,965 --> 00:13:39,475
And you're here.
That's so weird.

357
00:13:39,482 --> 00:13:41,142
- Yeah.
- That is so weird.

358
00:13:44,137 --> 00:13:45,447
[April Jane]
<i>I knew my son Gabriel</i>

359
00:13:45,448 --> 00:13:46,998
<i>was going to be
in Mexico with me.</i>

360
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,590
I thought he was gonna be
on a separate dating retreat,

361
00:13:49,586 --> 00:13:51,966
<i>but he's in my dating pool.</i>

362
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:55,095
And I'm gonna have to see
my son date these moms.

363
00:13:55,103 --> 00:13:56,623
This is crazy, bro.

364
00:13:59,689 --> 00:14:04,379
I'm feeling very overwhelmed
and a little scared.

365
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:06,549
<i>Seeing my son standing
in that line</i>

366
00:14:06,551 --> 00:14:09,661
<i>made me feel very awkward
because they're my son's age.</i>

367
00:14:09,655 --> 00:14:12,685
We're up. Let's go. We're up.

368
00:14:12,689 --> 00:14:15,479
I was a little shocked
to see Ryan in the pool.

369
00:14:15,482 --> 00:14:17,002
<i>I didn't see that
coming at all.</i>

370
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,210
[Ryan] <i>I'm gonna be honest.</i>

371
00:14:18,206 --> 00:14:19,546
<i>I'm thinking first pick
in the draft.</i>

372
00:14:19,551 --> 00:14:21,971
Like, I'm looking at
everything else before my mom.

373
00:14:21,965 --> 00:14:23,205
Thank God for that.

374
00:14:23,206 --> 00:14:24,546
[both laugh]

375
00:14:24,551 --> 00:14:25,831
[Joey] Hi, Mom.
How are you doing?

376
00:14:25,827 --> 00:14:27,967
[Kelle] Hey.
What are you doing here?

377
00:14:27,965 --> 00:14:30,205
Why are you following me
on the retreat, Joey?

378
00:14:30,206 --> 00:14:32,306
I'm here to find love.
Don't get in my way.

379
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:36,000
Honestly, honestly,
older women are very hot.

380
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,660
<i>And I know I got the swag
and I got the game for them.</i>

381
00:14:39,655 --> 00:14:41,545
Wow. This is like news to me.

382
00:14:42,655 --> 00:14:45,135
- Yes, Mom. Yes.
- Hmm.

383
00:14:45,137 --> 00:14:46,447
I'm Joey.
Nice to meet you.

384
00:14:46,448 --> 00:14:48,278
- Hey.
- What's your name?

385
00:14:48,275 --> 00:14:49,785
- I'm April.
- April, nice to meet you.

386
00:14:49,793 --> 00:14:51,693
- How are you?
- I'm doing great.

387
00:14:51,689 --> 00:14:53,659
- How about you?
- I'm fine.

388
00:14:53,655 --> 00:14:55,785
But whenever
I bring a woman home,

389
00:14:55,793 --> 00:14:58,863
it's all up to my mom
whether I'm dating her or not.

390
00:14:58,862 --> 00:15:00,172
Yes!

391
00:15:00,172 --> 00:15:03,072
[Kelle speaking]

392
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,688
Been winning. Been winning.

393
00:15:05,689 --> 00:15:06,759
- [Jose] Hi.
- Soyoung.

394
00:15:06,758 --> 00:15:07,998
- How are you?
- So young.

395
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,830
- Oh, amazing.
- Soyoung.

396
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,657
Amazing, amazing, amazing.

397
00:15:12,655 --> 00:15:14,515
[Pola speaking]

398
00:15:14,517 --> 00:15:16,687
[laughter]

399
00:15:16,689 --> 00:15:19,829
I think I have eye on,
uh, Jose.

400
00:15:19,827 --> 00:15:21,407
He's a perfect age for me.

401
00:15:21,413 --> 00:15:22,833
He don't have a tattoo.

402
00:15:22,827 --> 00:15:25,167
He's got green eyes.

403
00:15:25,172 --> 00:15:27,592
Kind of what I'm looking for.

404
00:15:27,586 --> 00:15:28,826
[Gabriel] How is everything?

405
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:30,067
[Kelle] It's amazing.
How are you?

406
00:15:30,068 --> 00:15:31,208
- It's good.
- Good.

407
00:15:31,206 --> 00:15:32,406
- Yeah.
- Good to see you.

408
00:15:32,413 --> 00:15:34,343
[Gabriel]
<i>I'm feeling a little weird.</i>

409
00:15:34,344 --> 00:15:36,664
<i>All these women
are significantly older women,</i>

410
00:15:36,655 --> 00:15:38,715
so it's pretty alarming.

411
00:15:38,724 --> 00:15:41,284
Not in a bad way.

412
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:44,205
Let's go.
We need to hit the bar.

413
00:15:44,206 --> 00:15:46,716
[Gabriel] <i>But then I started
looking at these women,</i>

414
00:15:46,724 --> 00:15:51,034
and I was like, "Damn,
they are kind of beautiful."

415
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:52,934
And then my mom's right there
and I was like...

416
00:15:54,517 --> 00:15:55,757
[cell phone vibrating]

417
00:15:55,758 --> 00:15:58,448
Hey, you guys,
I've got this text.

418
00:15:58,448 --> 00:16:01,518
So it says, "Greetings.

419
00:16:01,517 --> 00:16:04,307
You are about to start
a unique dating journey.

420
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:06,240
All of you have expressed
an openness

421
00:16:06,241 --> 00:16:08,281
to intergenerational dating.

422
00:16:08,275 --> 00:16:10,785
In the real world, there
is often a double standard

423
00:16:10,793 --> 00:16:11,933
where an older man

424
00:16:11,931 --> 00:16:14,101
with a younger woman
is accepted,

425
00:16:14,103 --> 00:16:16,763
but an older woman
with a younger man isn't."

426
00:16:16,758 --> 00:16:19,068
- Mm-hmm.
-"Not here."

427
00:16:19,068 --> 00:16:20,168
Whoo!

428
00:16:20,172 --> 00:16:21,312
[cell phone vibrating]

429
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:23,660
- [Jose] Okay, I got one, too.
- [Pola] Oh.

430
00:16:23,655 --> 00:16:25,445
"Over the next few weeks,

431
00:16:25,448 --> 00:16:27,898
you'll be part
of a dating experiment

432
00:16:27,896 --> 00:16:29,656
that will level
the playing field

433
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,925
and see if you can find
that special someone

434
00:16:31,931 --> 00:16:33,761
from a different age group."

435
00:16:33,758 --> 00:16:35,308
- [cell phone vibrating]
- I got a text guys.

436
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:36,550
[all laughing]

437
00:16:36,551 --> 00:16:39,171
"You are not exactly
on the show
you thought you were on.

438
00:16:39,172 --> 00:16:41,242
You are now
in the same dating pool.

439
00:16:41,241 --> 00:16:42,411
Open your minds

440
00:16:42,413 --> 00:16:45,623
and have an experience
you may have never imagined."

441
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,900
Hmm.

442
00:16:46,896 --> 00:16:48,476
I'll be in the hot tub
at 10:00.

443
00:16:48,482 --> 00:16:50,102
[laughter]

444
00:16:50,103 --> 00:16:52,593
Please, Ma,
you gotta chill out.

445
00:16:52,586 --> 00:16:55,166
I'm so excited
to meet these other guys.

446
00:16:55,172 --> 00:16:57,072
Sign me up.

447
00:16:57,068 --> 00:16:59,138
Don't judge me.

448
00:16:59,137 --> 00:17:00,277
Sorry, ladies.

449
00:17:00,275 --> 00:17:02,515
I might be sleeping
with your son.

450
00:17:02,517 --> 00:17:04,517
Looks like we're going
on a date, Harrison.

451
00:17:04,517 --> 00:17:05,967
[Harrison] Yeah, right.

452
00:17:05,965 --> 00:17:08,515
He goes, "Yeah, right."

453
00:17:08,517 --> 00:17:10,477
- Do you need to go home?
- No.

454
00:17:10,482 --> 00:17:12,142
It feels awkward because,
like, I didn't think

455
00:17:12,137 --> 00:17:13,377
it was just gonna be all moms.

456
00:17:13,379 --> 00:17:14,829
[Kelle] I just got here.

457
00:17:14,827 --> 00:17:16,717
[Harrison] <i>I'm not saying
the women are unattractive.</i>

458
00:17:16,724 --> 00:17:18,904
I'm just saying
they all have sons.

459
00:17:18,896 --> 00:17:20,756
And, like,
um, this is gonna be

460
00:17:20,758 --> 00:17:22,758
a weird experience
getting close with the guys,

461
00:17:22,758 --> 00:17:25,858
then, you know, going out
on dates with their mothers.

462
00:17:25,862 --> 00:17:27,482
[Gabriel speaking]

463
00:17:27,482 --> 00:17:28,622

[Soyoung speaking]

465
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:31,408
She's cutting open people
and stuff.

466
00:17:31,413 --> 00:17:33,243
[Pola] I would die there.

467
00:17:33,241 --> 00:17:34,661
Like, I see
a little bit of blood,

468
00:17:34,655 --> 00:17:36,335
a little bit of blood
and me and you...

469
00:17:36,344 --> 00:17:37,484
you, too, we faint.

470
00:17:37,482 --> 00:17:38,692
Tell them
what your favorite is.

471
00:17:38,689 --> 00:17:40,479
- What do you like to do?
- [Pola] Yeah.
Tell me, tell me.

472
00:17:40,482 --> 00:17:41,622
[Soyoung] Heart surgeon.

473
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,760
- Heart?
- [gasps]

474
00:17:42,758 --> 00:17:44,758
- [Pola] Oh, my God.
You're my hero.
- What?

475
00:17:44,758 --> 00:17:47,408
I am here to find
a special connection,

476
00:17:47,413 --> 00:17:49,933
and I hope my mom also finds
a special connection.

477
00:17:49,931 --> 00:17:51,971
<i>She's getting older, you know,
like she's not really, like,</i>

478
00:17:51,965 --> 00:17:54,715
out there looking
for a lover every day, right?

479
00:17:54,724 --> 00:17:55,904
You're not really,
like, out there

480
00:17:55,896 --> 00:17:57,026
actively searching, are you?

481
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:59,664
Well, Jimmy thinks so,
but who knows, right?

482
00:17:59,655 --> 00:18:02,375
We might find
the perfect love in here.

483
00:18:02,379 --> 00:18:04,589
Jimmy don't know about me.

484
00:18:04,586 --> 00:18:06,136
<i>It's not the blood
that makes me faint.</i>

485
00:18:06,137 --> 00:18:09,137
<i>It's more so like seeing
the beating heart in a body.</i>

486
00:18:09,137 --> 00:18:10,787
<i>I am open to all ages.</i>

487
00:18:10,793 --> 00:18:13,243
<i>My dating app is set to 65.</i>

488
00:18:13,241 --> 00:18:14,831
I'm close-minded, I guess.

489
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:17,207
I don't want to date
with 65-years-old man.

490
00:18:18,413 --> 00:18:19,793
[April Jane]
So you're gonna be 24.

491
00:18:19,793 --> 00:18:21,143
- Your son's 23?
- [Kelle] No, he's 20.

492
00:18:21,137 --> 00:18:22,757
[Joey] I'm about 21.

493
00:18:22,758 --> 00:18:24,618
Oh, you're the baby.

494
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,100
And you're gonna be 22, right?

495
00:18:26,103 --> 00:18:28,383
- I'm gonna be 22.
- He said you're both
the same age.

496
00:18:28,379 --> 00:18:30,719
- [laughs]
- Ooh...

497
00:18:30,724 --> 00:18:32,794
[Joey speaking]

498
00:18:32,793 --> 00:18:34,413
And I'm probably the oldest.

499
00:18:35,586 --> 00:18:37,616
Oh, no way.

500
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,100
- There's no way.
- [laughter]

501
00:18:40,103 --> 00:18:43,143
April is the woman
who immediately caught my eye.

502
00:18:43,137 --> 00:18:45,757
<i>I would like to get closer
with April. Who knows?</i>

503
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:48,478
Maybe I could get her
out of her comfort zone

504
00:18:48,482 --> 00:18:51,102
and show her what it's like
with a younger man.

505
00:18:51,103 --> 00:18:52,453
That's a beautiful ring,
by the way.

506
00:18:52,448 --> 00:18:53,588
[April Jane] Thank you.

507
00:18:53,586 --> 00:18:55,236
[Joey] Kind of reminds me
of your face.

508
00:18:55,241 --> 00:18:57,411
[April Jane laughing]

509
00:18:57,413 --> 00:18:59,453
Younger guys seem like
they have a zest for life.

510
00:18:59,448 --> 00:19:01,098
They're not jaded.

511
00:19:01,103 --> 00:19:03,313
And even though
I'm this age, I...

512
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,930
I've always been very physical
and have a high sex drive.

513
00:19:05,931 --> 00:19:07,661
So if you're gonna have
a younger guy,

514
00:19:07,655 --> 00:19:10,965
there's gonna be
a lot more sex, I would think.

515
00:19:10,965 --> 00:19:12,855
Joey, Joey,
which one's your mom?

516
00:19:12,862 --> 00:19:14,102
- Yeah.
- Ha!

517
00:19:14,103 --> 00:19:15,623
- Just kidding.
- There she is.

518
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,310
You really want me
to point her out?

519
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,760
It's pretty obvious.

520
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:20,448
Joey is just a young buck,

521
00:19:20,448 --> 00:19:22,478
and he's just probably gonna

522
00:19:22,482 --> 00:19:24,412
do something to my mom and try
and hit on another girl,

523
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:25,553
then another girl.

524
00:19:25,551 --> 00:19:28,031
So he's not going
anywhere near my mother.

525
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:29,484
Joey is gonna get a left hook.

526
00:19:29,482 --> 00:19:30,792
- I'm not kidding.
- He's fun.

527
00:19:30,793 --> 00:19:32,863
Joey is...
I'm not worried about Joey.

528
00:19:32,862 --> 00:19:34,482
Gabriel and I are both here

529
00:19:34,482 --> 00:19:38,312
because we wanted
to take this adventure.

530
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:41,930
It literally fell in our lap
from the heavens, and...

531
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:43,661
I can't. I'm sorry.
Oh, my God.

532
00:19:43,655 --> 00:19:45,825
Just, can you stop
and just let me talk?

533
00:19:45,827 --> 00:19:47,447
Can you do it again?
Can you not say...

534
00:19:47,448 --> 00:19:48,718
why are you saying heavens?

535
00:19:48,724 --> 00:19:50,384
Because
that's what I'm saying.

536
00:19:50,379 --> 00:19:51,929
I am my own person.

537
00:19:51,931 --> 00:19:53,311
But can you stop
interrupting me?

538
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,930
So...

539
00:19:54,931 --> 00:19:56,171
I'm sorry.

540
00:19:56,172 --> 00:19:58,142
[Ryan] Ma, Jose is your man.

541
00:19:58,137 --> 00:19:59,657
Jose looks mad responsible.

542
00:19:59,655 --> 00:20:00,965
- Like, I would trust--
- [Jose] What?

543
00:20:00,965 --> 00:20:02,855
[Ryan] Said you look mad
responsible, like...

544
00:20:02,862 --> 00:20:04,282
like you look
very trustworthy.

545
00:20:04,275 --> 00:20:06,995
Jose, cut the umbilical cord.

546
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,620
No, I mean, we're having
a good conversation.

547
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,830
We're learning a lot here.

548
00:20:09,827 --> 00:20:11,307
- [Pola] We can, we can...
- [Kelle] Pola...

549
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,970
[Jose] You're more than
welcome to join.

550
00:20:12,965 --> 00:20:15,825
There's this super-hot guy
named Jose,

551
00:20:15,827 --> 00:20:17,377
<i>and he seems like a safe bet</i>

552
00:20:17,379 --> 00:20:19,309
because he's
very family-oriented.

553
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:21,520
You can see, he's like tied
to his mom's hip.

554
00:20:21,517 --> 00:20:25,137
So I feel like he would
definitely just have my back

555
00:20:25,137 --> 00:20:28,787
and be by my side
and, you know,
be in my corner.

556
00:20:28,793 --> 00:20:30,173
[Joey]
I'm not calling you Dad.

557
00:20:30,172 --> 00:20:31,482
[all laughing]

558
00:20:31,482 --> 00:20:33,382
[Kelle] <i>I feel like I need
to get him away from his mom</i>

559
00:20:33,379 --> 00:20:36,379
and then see, you know,
what we can end up doing.

560
00:20:37,517 --> 00:20:39,167
[Gabriel] You're not,
you're not calling him Dad.

561
00:20:39,172 --> 00:20:40,282
You're calling him Daddy.

562
00:20:40,275 --> 00:20:41,755
[all laughing]

563
00:20:41,758 --> 00:20:43,138
No, I'm calling him Daddy.

564
00:20:43,137 --> 00:20:45,337
Oh!

565
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:46,624
[Kelle laughs]

566
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,690
[Charlene] Out of all
of the women here,

567
00:20:48,689 --> 00:20:51,969
Kelle is definitely going
for all of the attention.

568
00:20:51,965 --> 00:20:53,785
It's almost like
she's campaigning.

569
00:20:53,793 --> 00:20:55,143
You call him father.

570
00:20:56,793 --> 00:20:58,903
It seems like
a lot of work to me.

571
00:21:04,206 --> 00:21:05,516
[Pola] "Attention, daters.

572
00:21:05,517 --> 00:21:07,687
There are eight duos here

573
00:21:07,689 --> 00:21:09,929
and there are eight bedrooms
in the villa.

574
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:14,003
Each duo will share
a room together."

575
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,520
I'll be honest, I had
concerns about rooming

576
00:21:16,517 --> 00:21:22,237
with Ryan because in the past
I have seen his home.

577
00:21:22,241 --> 00:21:25,341
Mmm, not the child
that I raised,

578
00:21:25,344 --> 00:21:26,764
<i>as far as cleanliness.</i>

579
00:21:26,758 --> 00:21:30,168
We don't get to spend
as much time together
as we used to.

580
00:21:30,172 --> 00:21:32,552
So instead of shading me,
if anything,

581
00:21:32,551 --> 00:21:35,721
this is a moment
to bring us closer together.

582
00:21:35,724 --> 00:21:37,554
"Not all the rooms
are the same.

583
00:21:37,551 --> 00:21:40,071
There are two large
master suites

584
00:21:40,068 --> 00:21:41,718
with hot tubs inside
the room."

585
00:21:41,724 --> 00:21:43,104
- That's crazy.
- Oh, my God.

586
00:21:43,103 --> 00:21:44,763
[Pola] "Head outside,
where the moms

587
00:21:44,758 --> 00:21:47,968
who are the most
in touch with their sons
will win the suites."

588
00:21:49,068 --> 00:21:51,758
[Joey] Okay. Super weird.

589
00:21:51,758 --> 00:21:53,338
<i>When we get the text
that we're gonna be</i>

590
00:21:53,344 --> 00:21:55,284
staying in the same bedroom,

591
00:21:55,275 --> 00:21:56,925
<i>my mom and I were
really close,</i>

592
00:21:56,931 --> 00:21:59,341
but dating lives
are very separate.

593
00:21:59,344 --> 00:22:01,664
<i>I don't want to see
who she's trying to flirt on,</i>

594
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:04,275
<i>and now we're gonna be
living together.</i>

595
00:22:04,275 --> 00:22:07,065
What did I get myself into?

596
00:22:07,068 --> 00:22:08,898
Who wants to sleep
with their moms?

597
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,136
Weird.

598
00:22:12,068 --> 00:22:14,448
[April Jane] All the young men
take their shirts off.

599
00:22:14,448 --> 00:22:15,828
[Shannan] <i>Who's ready
for a checkup</i>

600
00:22:15,827 --> 00:22:17,757
<i>at the doctor's office?</i>

601
00:22:17,758 --> 00:22:21,028
Oh, that's nice. Oh.

602
00:22:21,034 --> 00:22:24,554
I have no interest in watching
my mom feeling a man.

603
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:25,831
<i>I'm not here for that.</i>

604
00:22:25,827 --> 00:22:27,757
[Shannan] <i>Nothing wrong
with a little touch and feel.</i>

605
00:22:27,758 --> 00:22:29,138
[Kelle speaking]

606
00:22:29,137 --> 00:22:30,587
[Ryan speaking]

607
00:22:30,586 --> 00:22:31,826
[Ryan] <i>Where are
we going with this?</i>

608
00:22:31,827 --> 00:22:33,927
Are we... you're trying
to get day one strokes?

609
00:22:33,931 --> 00:22:35,141
Like, I don't know.

610
00:22:35,137 --> 00:22:37,827
[Joey] You're joking!

611
00:22:37,827 --> 00:22:39,167
I'm cock-blocking my mom

612
00:22:39,172 --> 00:22:41,662
because you've known him
for six hours.

613
00:22:41,655 --> 00:22:43,165
[Kelle] Calm down. [laughs]

614
00:22:43,172 --> 00:22:44,382
No.

615
00:22:48,448 --> 00:22:50,068
- [April Jane] I have twins.
- [Shannan] Do you?

616
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:51,658
[April Jane] Three boys.
Gabriel is a twin.

617
00:22:51,655 --> 00:22:52,785
[Shannan] Oh, wow.

618
00:22:52,793 --> 00:22:54,593
[April Jane] But they don't
look alike, fraternal.

619
00:22:54,586 --> 00:22:57,066
- [Shannan] Fraternal.
- [Kelle] So you brought
the ugly one. Thanks.

620
00:22:57,068 --> 00:23:00,658
[laughter]

621
00:23:00,655 --> 00:23:01,785
We get a text.

622
00:23:01,793 --> 00:23:03,523
We have our first challenge,

623
00:23:03,517 --> 00:23:06,067
<i>and all the young men
take their shirts off.</i>

624
00:23:06,068 --> 00:23:10,138
I want you and you
and you and you.

625
00:23:10,137 --> 00:23:11,897
Everyone but me.

626
00:23:11,896 --> 00:23:12,996
Sorry.

627
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,480
The moms get a blindfold
and they have to go up

628
00:23:16,482 --> 00:23:18,592
<i>and touch
all of the young men</i>

629
00:23:18,586 --> 00:23:22,406
<i>and figure out by touching
their chests and abs
and shoulders</i>

630
00:23:22,413 --> 00:23:24,343
<i>which one is their son.</i>

631
00:23:24,344 --> 00:23:26,414
<i>The two moms
that figure out</i>

632
00:23:26,413 --> 00:23:28,793
<i>who their son is
the quickest win</i>

633
00:23:28,793 --> 00:23:31,593
the best suites
in the whole house.

634
00:23:31,586 --> 00:23:33,996
So the competition is on.

635
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,450
I need you guys to help me
find my son

636
00:23:37,448 --> 00:23:38,858
if you want to hang out
with me tonight.

637
00:23:40,758 --> 00:23:42,478
Oh, my God.

638
00:23:42,482 --> 00:23:45,002
[Jose] <i>This challenge is
very important for you to win.</i>

639
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,520
Okay, so be focused,
and we're gonna win.

640
00:23:47,517 --> 00:23:50,137
I want to stay in the suite,
so we have to be careful.

641
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,337
Quick.

642
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Who wants to win?

643
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,930
You've never rubbed me up
and down.

644
00:23:56,931 --> 00:23:58,341
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

645
00:23:58,344 --> 00:24:00,554
You don't know
who's who, so...

646
00:24:00,551 --> 00:24:02,281
[Joey speaking]

647
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:03,855
I'm ready.

648
00:24:03,862 --> 00:24:05,832
<i>I just hope she doesn't go
below the waist</i>

649
00:24:05,827 --> 00:24:07,167
whenever she's
groping these guys,

650
00:24:07,172 --> 00:24:10,452
because that,
that will be out of line.

651
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:11,928
Out of line.

652
00:24:14,896 --> 00:24:17,826
There's still mommies
in the house!

653
00:24:17,827 --> 00:24:20,587
If I pick Joey, hopefully
I don't pick him first,

654
00:24:20,586 --> 00:24:23,926
because, yeah, we'll have
a nice room, but it's like...

655
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,662
I kind of want more than that.

656
00:24:27,896 --> 00:24:29,066
Hmm.

657
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:31,378
[April] Not rigid, ain't it?

658
00:24:31,379 --> 00:24:32,519
[Kelle] No.

659
00:24:32,517 --> 00:24:34,137
Ooh.

660
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:38,407
Mmm...

661
00:24:38,413 --> 00:24:40,143
I don't think so. Nope.

662
00:24:41,344 --> 00:24:43,074
No. Ow.

663
00:24:43,068 --> 00:24:44,858
[laughter]

664
00:24:44,862 --> 00:24:47,972
[Joey] <i>I've never experienced
something like this.</i>

665
00:24:47,965 --> 00:24:50,685
My mom never really shows me

666
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:53,379
<i>like the younger guys
that she dates.</i>

667
00:24:53,379 --> 00:24:56,239
<i>Or especially, like,
touching them
in front of my face.</i>

668
00:24:56,241 --> 00:24:58,211
I mean, that's...
that's pretty weird to me.

669
00:25:01,551 --> 00:25:02,831
[Kelle] Joey?

670
00:25:03,931 --> 00:25:05,481
This is my son.

671
00:25:05,482 --> 00:25:08,282
Ugh, Ma!
You're one off.

672
00:25:08,275 --> 00:25:09,405
[cheering]

673
00:25:09,413 --> 00:25:11,213
I got Jimmy?
I got Jimmy?

674
00:25:11,206 --> 00:25:13,096
[Joey] Oh, Mom. Ugh!

675
00:25:13,103 --> 00:25:14,863
He got you!
I knew he would.

676
00:25:14,862 --> 00:25:16,552
- [Kelle] Yes! Yes!
- [Joey] I knew he would!

677
00:25:16,551 --> 00:25:18,381
[Kelle] I wanted
you to be my son.

678
00:25:18,379 --> 00:25:21,069
Yeah! Whoo!

679
00:25:21,068 --> 00:25:23,378
Whoo! Yes!

680
00:25:23,379 --> 00:25:25,929
- [Joey] Oh, my God.
- [Soyoung] <i>Kelle gets Jimmy.</i>

681
00:25:25,931 --> 00:25:27,481
And she was
really touchy, touchy.

682
00:25:27,482 --> 00:25:29,242
Fantasy suite! Sorry,

683
00:25:29,241 --> 00:25:30,451
Soyoung.

684
00:25:30,448 --> 00:25:33,718
[Soyoung speaking]

685
00:25:33,724 --> 00:25:35,384
That would have been game, right?

686
00:25:35,379 --> 00:25:37,209
All men touching women.

687
00:25:37,206 --> 00:25:39,856
That would have been killer.

688
00:25:39,862 --> 00:25:41,102
You should've done that.

689
00:25:42,586 --> 00:25:44,376
Here we go.
Here we go.

690
00:25:45,965 --> 00:25:49,095
Who's ready for a checkup
at the doctor's office?

691
00:25:49,103 --> 00:25:51,243
[laughter]

692
00:25:51,241 --> 00:25:54,451
Oh, that's nice.

693
00:25:54,448 --> 00:25:55,658
Oh.

694
00:25:55,655 --> 00:25:59,275
I have no interest in watching
my mom feel on men.

695
00:25:59,275 --> 00:26:00,655
I'm not here for that.

696
00:26:00,655 --> 00:26:03,165
[Shannan] Oh, nice pecks.

697
00:26:03,172 --> 00:26:04,412
Nice traps.

698
00:26:04,413 --> 00:26:06,623
Oh. Mmm.

699
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,100
<i>We are both grown.</i>

700
00:26:08,103 --> 00:26:11,863
<i>And nothing wrong
with a little touch and feel.</i>

701
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:13,662
- [Ryan] <i>Fine.</i>
- I'm just saying.

702
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:14,785
Okay.

703
00:26:14,793 --> 00:26:16,663
This feels like my child.

704
00:26:16,655 --> 00:26:18,025
Okay, I'm gonna say yes.

705
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:20,284
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

706
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:23,546
[Pola speaking
in foreign language]

707
00:26:23,551 --> 00:26:26,591
[Pola] Like I will notice
Jose's shoulder.

708
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:29,856
It's like very... deep.

709
00:26:29,862 --> 00:26:31,282
I know your shoulders.

710
00:26:31,275 --> 00:26:33,925
Me and Jose train
every day at my studio,

711
00:26:33,931 --> 00:26:36,031
so this is really easy for me.

712
00:26:37,241 --> 00:26:39,001
This is Jose. Oh!

713
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,480
[laughter]

714
00:26:45,413 --> 00:26:46,623
[April Jane] <i>I'm a trainer.</i>

715
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,830
You know,
I appreciate muscle.

716
00:26:48,827 --> 00:26:51,757
So I actually like
this challenge.

717
00:26:51,758 --> 00:26:53,028
I didn't like this challenge.

718
00:26:54,689 --> 00:26:56,309
- That's my Gabriel.
- Yeah.

719
00:26:58,724 --> 00:27:00,344
[Charlene] Harrison.

720
00:27:00,344 --> 00:27:01,764
No?

721
00:27:01,758 --> 00:27:04,208
I was right here.
I was right here.

722
00:27:06,206 --> 00:27:08,516
Well, is there
somebody over here?

723
00:27:08,517 --> 00:27:09,717
Billy.

724
00:27:09,724 --> 00:27:11,214
- Wow.
- That was pretty quick.

725
00:27:11,206 --> 00:27:12,406
This is Billy.

726
00:27:12,413 --> 00:27:14,593
[cheering]

727
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,447
<i>I'm very excited,</i>

728
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:22,338
so I could feel
the abs a little bit.

729
00:27:24,103 --> 00:27:25,343
Hmm.

730
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:30,406
[laughter]

731
00:27:33,965 --> 00:27:37,715
Soyoung's style of trying
to pick her son

732
00:27:37,724 --> 00:27:40,454
was very aggressive,
in my opinion.

733
00:27:41,896 --> 00:27:43,166
What?

734
00:27:44,344 --> 00:27:45,694
She's wild.

735
00:27:49,517 --> 00:27:50,857
That's my son.

736
00:27:50,862 --> 00:27:52,342
Yes, it is!

737
00:27:52,344 --> 00:27:54,174
[all laughing]

738
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:05,588
[producer speaking]

739
00:28:05,586 --> 00:28:07,446
Yeah, he does.

740
00:28:07,448 --> 00:28:08,548
[Gabriel] <i>Can you not...</i>

741
00:28:08,551 --> 00:28:10,341
It sounds so bad. Yeah.
I picked up women, really?

742
00:28:10,344 --> 00:28:13,144
Okay, okay, okay. Okay. Okay.
I won't say that.

743
00:28:13,137 --> 00:28:15,477
I have definitely raised
a gentleman.

744
00:28:15,482 --> 00:28:17,482
Aww.

745
00:28:17,482 --> 00:28:19,002
Guys, I have a text.

746
00:28:20,517 --> 00:28:22,997
"Congratulations.
Your time is a winner."

747
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,280
[cheering and applause]

748
00:28:25,275 --> 00:28:26,615
[Stefany] "You get the suite."

749
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,070
Wow.

750
00:28:28,068 --> 00:28:29,588
Who's the second winner?

751
00:28:29,586 --> 00:28:30,926
Wait, another text message.

752
00:28:30,931 --> 00:28:32,341
I got a text message.

753
00:28:34,103 --> 00:28:35,833
So it says, congratulations.

754
00:28:35,827 --> 00:28:36,997
I was second place.

755
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,140
I get the suite
with a hot tub on the patio.

756
00:28:40,137 --> 00:28:41,787
You're all welcome.

757
00:28:41,793 --> 00:28:43,143
[cheering and applause]

758
00:28:43,137 --> 00:28:45,237
Yeah, Jose!

759
00:28:45,241 --> 00:28:46,411
Jose, I got last.

760
00:28:46,413 --> 00:28:49,723
So you can meet me
at the bungalow outside.

761
00:28:49,724 --> 00:28:51,454
Oh.

762
00:28:51,448 --> 00:28:53,168
[Pola]
<i>I don't get Kelle very well.</i>

763
00:28:53,172 --> 00:28:56,662
She needs to do something
to bring the attention to her.

764
00:28:56,655 --> 00:28:57,785
And I don't think that's nice,

765
00:28:57,793 --> 00:29:00,483
because you don't need
to always be

766
00:29:00,482 --> 00:29:02,142
the center of everything.

767
00:29:02,137 --> 00:29:03,337
I can't.

768
00:29:03,344 --> 00:29:05,764
Sorry,
I can't hear you over there.

769
00:29:14,448 --> 00:29:15,548
[Stefany] Moving in.

770
00:29:15,551 --> 00:29:17,001
[Billy] Are you joking?

771
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,210
[Stefany] <i>Hi,</i>

772
00:29:18,206 --> 00:29:20,656
- <i>welcome to my house.</i>
- Oh, my God.

773
00:29:20,655 --> 00:29:22,205
This is amazing, you know.

774
00:29:22,206 --> 00:29:23,856
- We won.
- Yeah.

775
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:25,692
- We've won the suite.
- Thank God.

776
00:29:25,689 --> 00:29:27,899
You guys got, like,
a living room area.

777
00:29:27,896 --> 00:29:30,066
- [Stefany] <i>We have everything.</i>
- [Charlene] <i>Wow.</i>

778
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:31,828
[Billy] <i>I'm stoked about
being able to, like,</i>

779
00:29:31,827 --> 00:29:33,027
get in the sauna.

780
00:29:33,034 --> 00:29:34,694
[Stefany] <i>And then we have
the hot tub, too.</i>

781
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:36,859
[Billy]
<i>Yeah, that was a plus.</i>

782
00:29:36,862 --> 00:29:39,002
[Stefany] Just don't bring
any of the moms in here.

783
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,520
- Please do not do that.
- Okay, I won't.

784
00:29:41,517 --> 00:29:44,207
[Pola] Wow.
I feel like a queen.

785
00:29:44,206 --> 00:29:46,716
Like the suite is gorgeous.

786
00:29:46,724 --> 00:29:48,794
The space is huge.

787
00:29:48,793 --> 00:29:50,553
- Wow.
- Yeah, that's super cool.

788
00:29:50,551 --> 00:29:52,001
<i>You're not worried
a little bit,</i>

789
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,900
like just sleeping
in a stranger house with--

790
00:29:53,896 --> 00:29:56,206
No, I'm just gonna
stay close to you.

791
00:29:56,206 --> 00:29:57,656
Oh, you have
a good relationship.

792
00:29:57,655 --> 00:29:58,855
- So there's...
- So it's okay, right?

793
00:29:58,862 --> 00:30:00,212
I mean, I guess.

794
00:30:00,206 --> 00:30:01,996
[laughs]

795
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,140
- [Pola]
Everything is beautiful.
- [Jose] Yeah.

796
00:30:04,137 --> 00:30:05,657
[sighs]

797
00:30:10,344 --> 00:30:13,034
You know, it's more common
for the guys to like
the older girls,

798
00:30:13,034 --> 00:30:14,384
you know,
that's kind of a thing.

799
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:16,069
Like, they have MILF,
they have cougar.

800
00:30:16,068 --> 00:30:19,028
We don't have a cute label
for young guys.

801
00:30:19,034 --> 00:30:21,144
You should just call them
Ryan Jevons.

802
00:30:21,137 --> 00:30:23,137
I'm gonna put that name
on the outside of my room.

803
00:30:23,137 --> 00:30:25,067
I'll see. All right.
See, that's...

804
00:30:25,068 --> 00:30:26,898
I don't know, that could be
taken a lot of ways.

805
00:30:29,034 --> 00:30:31,144
[Ryan] <i>Kelle is not
the natural esthetic</i>

806
00:30:31,137 --> 00:30:33,377
for people that I date,

807
00:30:33,379 --> 00:30:35,689
but Kelle's energy
is tight hot.

808
00:30:35,689 --> 00:30:38,169
Like, her spice level
is at an all-time high.

809
00:30:39,586 --> 00:30:41,516
You never know
what's bound to happen.

810
00:30:41,517 --> 00:30:44,377
What do you think
is the difference between
MILF and cougar?

811
00:30:44,379 --> 00:30:45,659
I'll...
I'll tell you exactly

812
00:30:45,655 --> 00:30:48,065
the difference
because I am still a MILF.

813
00:30:48,068 --> 00:30:50,378
I am not a cougar until
I reach a certain age.

814
00:30:50,379 --> 00:30:52,409
MILF is like
that age between.

815
00:30:52,413 --> 00:30:53,903
[Kelle] I don't look at age, though.

816
00:30:53,896 --> 00:30:56,716
I think that's where society
is totally messed up

817
00:30:56,724 --> 00:30:59,004
because I attract
a lot of younger men

818
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,550
because I have a younger...

819
00:31:00,551 --> 00:31:02,791
- Spirit.
- [Kelle]
...spirit and personality.

820
00:31:02,793 --> 00:31:05,143
I felt a little displaced
just being here

821
00:31:05,137 --> 00:31:06,447
and seeing everyone, you know.

822
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:08,658
- But it's like...
- Well...

823
00:31:08,655 --> 00:31:10,785
I think, everybody just has
to get out of their shell.

824
00:31:10,793 --> 00:31:13,763
People become too guarded,
then you don't learn anything

825
00:31:13,758 --> 00:31:15,098
and you'll never know
what you'll find.

826
00:31:15,103 --> 00:31:16,383
[Charlene] Yeah,
that's the truth.

827
00:31:16,379 --> 00:31:17,619
- I mean...
- [Ryan] Toast to that.

828
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:20,280
[Charlene]
<i>I'm actually realizing, like,</i>

829
00:31:20,275 --> 00:31:22,785
this is a chance for us
to learn about ourselves.

830
00:31:22,793 --> 00:31:24,793
Whether we all find
true love or not,

831
00:31:24,793 --> 00:31:26,793
<i>it's an opportunity
for growth,</i>

832
00:31:26,793 --> 00:31:28,103
<i>and there's some
great people here.</i>

833
00:31:28,103 --> 00:31:30,313
<i>Like, let's just enjoy
this moment,</i>

834
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:32,620
because that's meant to be.

835
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,760
I'm gonna go to the restroom,

836
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:35,548
so I'm gonna say good night
if I don't see you.

837
00:31:35,551 --> 00:31:37,481
- Good night.
- [Joey] Good night.

838
00:31:37,482 --> 00:31:39,792
I mean,
I honestly learned a lot from,

839
00:31:39,793 --> 00:31:40,933
like all of that talking.

840
00:31:40,931 --> 00:31:42,411
- I mean...
- You did?

841
00:31:42,413 --> 00:31:44,663
Everything that's come out
of his mouth has been
just straight facts.

842
00:31:44,655 --> 00:31:45,895
I'm just wrong.
I'm just wrong.

843
00:31:45,896 --> 00:31:47,406
- You know, I'm just like...
- You're welcome.

844
00:31:47,413 --> 00:31:48,793
This is your dad.

845
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:52,240
Mom, you gotta be joking.

846
00:31:52,241 --> 00:31:54,031
You know what room we're in.

847
00:31:54,034 --> 00:31:56,624
Although I know
she's got it in her to flirt,

848
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,070
and she does do that a lot,

849
00:31:58,068 --> 00:32:01,858
I've never seen it
firsthand experience.

850
00:32:01,862 --> 00:32:03,342
Ready?

851
00:32:03,344 --> 00:32:05,484
You two,
I'll see you tomorrow.

852
00:32:05,482 --> 00:32:06,762
No, we're going in together.

853
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,028
[Ryan] Sleep easy.

854
00:32:08,034 --> 00:32:10,284
- Still give me love.
- We're going in together.

855
00:32:10,275 --> 00:32:11,515
Bye, Joey.

856
00:32:11,517 --> 00:32:13,027
The reason why we're here

857
00:32:13,034 --> 00:32:15,454
is to date everyone
in the villa,

858
00:32:15,448 --> 00:32:17,718
<i>and I'm taking
that opportunity</i>

859
00:32:17,724 --> 00:32:20,344
so I can make a good decision
on if there would be

860
00:32:20,344 --> 00:32:22,314
a romantic connection
with somebody.

861
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:24,000
How are we gonna move
your mama out of the room?

862
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,340
[Ryan] Now,
how could I do that?

863
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,724
Can you pick her up?

864
00:32:26,724 --> 00:32:29,694
[Joey] Y'all moving
your mama out of the room?

865
00:32:29,689 --> 00:32:30,969
No!

866
00:32:30,965 --> 00:32:33,515
[Kelle] I'll be kicking
Joey out of my room.

867
00:32:33,517 --> 00:32:34,657
- [Joey] No!
- [Kelle] Bye, Joey.

868
00:32:34,655 --> 00:32:36,305
[Joey] I'm not sleeping
on the bathroom.

869
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,450
Please, no.

870
00:32:37,448 --> 00:32:39,968
For some reason,
I'm immediately drawn to Ryan.

871
00:32:39,965 --> 00:32:41,825
<i>And I mean,
I get it, it's night one,</i>

872
00:32:41,827 --> 00:32:45,027
<i>but I'm very, very open
with sex.</i>

873
00:32:45,034 --> 00:32:47,934
<i>I mean, I would love
to find love if it's here,</i>

874
00:32:47,931 --> 00:32:51,481
but more so, I'm gonna have
a lot of fun.

875
00:32:51,482 --> 00:32:53,592
I'm texting him right now.

876
00:32:53,586 --> 00:32:54,966
[Joey] Mom.

877
00:32:54,965 --> 00:32:57,135
I go, "WYD?"

878
00:32:57,137 --> 00:33:00,137
What are you doing?

879
00:33:00,137 --> 00:33:01,857
Oh, he's messaging me back.

880
00:33:04,793 --> 00:33:06,693
Oh, wait,
I just got a message.

881
00:33:07,931 --> 00:33:10,451
"Where are you?"

882
00:33:10,448 --> 00:33:13,028
You said, "Come up here."

883
00:33:13,034 --> 00:33:15,664
Mom! Mom!

884
00:33:15,655 --> 00:33:19,545
[Kelle speaking]

885
00:33:19,551 --> 00:33:20,831
I'm going to the bathroom.

886
00:33:20,827 --> 00:33:21,927
[Kelle] You go to bathroom.

887
00:33:21,931 --> 00:33:23,591
[Kelle speaking]

888
00:33:23,586 --> 00:33:26,786
If Joey continues
to cock-block me
this entire time,

889
00:33:26,793 --> 00:33:28,863
he's going to ruin
the experience for me.

890
00:33:28,862 --> 00:33:35,102
- [Kelle speaking]
- [Ryan speaking]

891
00:33:35,103 --> 00:33:36,663
The second room on the left.

892
00:33:36,655 --> 00:33:38,585
Oh, my God!

893
00:33:38,586 --> 00:33:40,546
You've got to be joking.

894
00:33:40,551 --> 00:33:41,761
[Ryan] Just chilling.

895
00:33:41,758 --> 00:33:43,408
Bye, Joey.

896
00:33:43,413 --> 00:33:45,073
Don't be a hater, Joey.

897
00:33:45,068 --> 00:33:47,718
Ma, you gotta chill out.

898
00:33:47,724 --> 00:33:49,074
[Kelle] Come upstairs.

899
00:33:50,586 --> 00:33:52,276
So far, we've had
some great conversations.

900
00:33:52,275 --> 00:33:54,445
I've been very open.
I've been very real with her.

901
00:33:54,448 --> 00:33:58,028
So at this point, you know,
where are we going with this?

902
00:33:58,034 --> 00:34:00,214
Are we... you're trying to get
the day one strokes?

903
00:34:00,206 --> 00:34:01,336
Like, I don't know.

904
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:08,173
[Joey] You're joking!

905
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:11,410
[Jimmy] We got, like,
moms here.

906
00:34:11,413 --> 00:34:13,173
Like, we got to really
step our game up.

907
00:34:13,172 --> 00:34:15,072
[Gabriel] <i>I'm not like
head over heels for anyone.</i>

908
00:34:15,068 --> 00:34:16,168
<i>Are you?</i>

909
00:34:16,172 --> 00:34:17,452
I mean, I got my eye on one, though.

910
00:34:17,448 --> 00:34:18,898
- That's about it.
- [Gabriel] Who?

911
00:34:18,896 --> 00:34:21,476
- [Jimmy] <i>Pola.</i>
- <i>Pola has these feet that
I just want to, like,</i>

912
00:34:21,482 --> 00:34:22,592
<i>shove them in my mouth.</i>

913
00:34:22,586 --> 00:34:24,236
[laughs]

914
00:34:31,586 --> 00:34:34,236
[Joey] You're joking!

915
00:34:34,241 --> 00:34:36,591
Really not trying
to sleep in here

916
00:34:36,586 --> 00:34:39,206
with Ryan on the other bed.

917
00:34:39,206 --> 00:34:41,136
I'm just telling you
to make sure

918
00:34:41,137 --> 00:34:43,097
you're up in time to go
to the gym in the morning, bro.

919
00:34:43,103 --> 00:34:45,453
- [Kelle] No, Joey.
- [Joey] I'll see you
at the gym tomorrow morning.

920
00:34:45,448 --> 00:34:46,928
All right, tomorrow morning, bro.

921
00:34:46,931 --> 00:34:49,001
- [Kelle] Joey, lay down.
- Make sure you're up.

922
00:34:50,689 --> 00:34:54,309
I'm cock-blocking my mom
because first night, no.

923
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:56,550
You've known him
for six hours.

924
00:34:56,551 --> 00:34:59,031
You can't just immediately
go into,

925
00:34:59,034 --> 00:35:02,694
you know, I want to...
and then... yeah.

926
00:35:02,689 --> 00:35:04,929
[Kelle] Joey, calm down.

927
00:35:04,931 --> 00:35:07,101
- Calm down.
- No.

928
00:35:19,724 --> 00:35:22,454
I'm not, like,
head over heels for anyone.

929
00:35:22,448 --> 00:35:23,688
Are you?

930
00:35:23,689 --> 00:35:25,169
I mean, I got
my eye on one, though.

931
00:35:25,172 --> 00:35:26,282
- That's about it.
- Who?

932
00:35:26,275 --> 00:35:28,095
- [Jimmy] Pola.
- [Gabriel speaking]

933
00:35:28,103 --> 00:35:29,213
[Jimmy] Yeah.

934
00:35:29,206 --> 00:35:31,786
I find Pola
absolutely beautiful.

935
00:35:31,793 --> 00:35:33,523
I'm a man of great taste.

936
00:35:33,517 --> 00:35:34,857
I like great things.

937
00:35:34,862 --> 00:35:36,282
<i>I'm a very big feet person.</i>

938
00:35:36,275 --> 00:35:38,335
<i>And Pola has these feet
that I just want to, like,</i>

939
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:40,524
oil up and lather
and just massage

940
00:35:40,517 --> 00:35:42,967
and get real warm
and then paint her toenails

941
00:35:42,965 --> 00:35:47,755
maybe a color and, like,
suck the acrylic off them toes

942
00:35:47,758 --> 00:35:49,758
and shove them in my mouth.

943
00:35:49,758 --> 00:35:51,448
Yeah.

944
00:35:51,448 --> 00:35:52,828
Ha-ha!

945
00:35:52,827 --> 00:35:55,307
We can't be vanilla, bro.
We got, like, moms here.

946
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:57,310
Like, we gotta really
step our game up.

947
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:58,790
No.

948
00:36:04,137 --> 00:36:05,237
Wow.

949
00:36:05,241 --> 00:36:06,691
[Jimmy] You think
this is gonna be good?

950
00:36:06,689 --> 00:36:07,999
- [Jose] Dude, it's...
- [Kelle] Wow.

951
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,720
It's a pineapple martini.

952
00:36:09,724 --> 00:36:11,904
[Pola] It looks beautiful.
Thank you.

953
00:36:11,896 --> 00:36:13,166
[Jimmy] So...

954
00:36:15,655 --> 00:36:17,405
- Thank you so much.
- For you, Madame.

955
00:36:17,413 --> 00:36:19,593
- Gracias, senor.
- Oh, you're so welcome.

956
00:36:21,482 --> 00:36:22,722
So, Pola, I was thinking

957
00:36:22,724 --> 00:36:24,284
I really would love
to get to know you

958
00:36:24,275 --> 00:36:25,405
and go on
a paddleboarding date,

959
00:36:25,413 --> 00:36:26,623
maybe if you're,
like, interested.

960
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:29,000
Yes. That's cool.
Let's do it. Yeah.

961
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,280
So it's down on the beach.

962
00:36:30,275 --> 00:36:32,205
The paddleboards
are over there if you'd like
to go with me.

963
00:36:32,206 --> 00:36:34,066
- [Pola] Yeah.
Let's go. Let's go.
- Let's go.

964
00:36:35,241 --> 00:36:38,861
My mom is picked to go out
on her first date.

965
00:36:38,862 --> 00:36:40,032
I don't know what to think.

966
00:36:40,034 --> 00:36:41,454
Okay.

967
00:36:41,448 --> 00:36:42,718
It's our paddleboards.

968
00:36:42,724 --> 00:36:44,554
[Jose]
<i>It's just that feeling inside</i>

969
00:36:44,551 --> 00:36:46,481
<i>that I don't really
trust these guys yet.</i>

970
00:36:46,482 --> 00:36:48,242
[producer speaking]

971
00:36:51,448 --> 00:36:54,098
[Pola laughing]

972
00:36:54,103 --> 00:36:58,383
Well, yeah. Most of the guys
are too young for my mom.

973
00:36:58,379 --> 00:36:59,829
So have you ever
paddleboarded before?

974
00:36:59,827 --> 00:37:01,407
Actually, I have
a paddleboard just...

975
00:37:01,413 --> 00:37:02,933
- No way, at home in Miami?
- Yeah. I do.

976
00:37:02,931 --> 00:37:04,071
- Oh, it's...
- I do, I do.

977
00:37:04,068 --> 00:37:06,758
Just don't be as naive
as you usually are.

978
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,660
[Pola] I'm sure
he's a nice guy.

979
00:37:09,655 --> 00:37:13,095
Many times the nicest guys
are not the nicest guys.

980
00:37:13,103 --> 00:37:14,413
Just be careful.

981
00:37:17,413 --> 00:37:19,763
Let's go, faster.

982
00:37:19,758 --> 00:37:21,788
[Pola laughing]

983
00:37:24,448 --> 00:37:25,968
[Pola]
<i>I dance classical ballet</i>

984
00:37:25,965 --> 00:37:27,925
<i>since I was four years old.</i>

985
00:37:27,931 --> 00:37:31,311
<i>I love everything that
has to do with physical,
active life.</i>

986
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:34,930
So if a man cannot keep up
with me physically,

987
00:37:34,931 --> 00:37:38,071
I think I'm not gonna be
attracted to him at all.

988
00:37:38,068 --> 00:37:40,518
<i>And Jimmy, the activity
that he chose, what...</i>

989
00:37:40,517 --> 00:37:42,757
<i>it's exactly
what I really enjoy.</i>

990
00:37:42,758 --> 00:37:45,968
So that's something
that I really like about him.

991
00:37:45,965 --> 00:37:47,235
[Jimmy groans]

992
00:37:47,241 --> 00:37:48,411
Whoo!

993
00:37:48,413 --> 00:37:51,003
At first, I'm really
nervous about Pola and I.

994
00:37:52,655 --> 00:37:55,165
But wow,
she was a very playful person

995
00:37:55,172 --> 00:37:56,342
and I love it about her.

996
00:37:56,344 --> 00:37:58,144
[Pola] All right,
let's go. Let's go.

997
00:37:58,137 --> 00:38:01,477
[Jimmy] She has the idea,
let's do yoga and wants
to do the airplane.

998
00:38:01,482 --> 00:38:03,832
And I'm... I'm so for it.

999
00:38:03,827 --> 00:38:05,997
[Pola chuckles]

1000
00:38:08,517 --> 00:38:10,617
I was comfortable being,
you know, on top of her.

1001
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,660
Are you ready?

1002
00:38:12,655 --> 00:38:14,305
[Pola laughing]

1003
00:38:16,413 --> 00:38:17,833
That wasn't good.

1004
00:38:17,827 --> 00:38:20,717
<i>It's really fun doing
the airplane
on the board with Jimmy.</i>

1005
00:38:20,724 --> 00:38:23,384
And I used to do that
with Jose when he was smaller.

1006
00:38:23,379 --> 00:38:24,659
I love to do that with kids.

1007
00:38:24,655 --> 00:38:26,615
So this is really fun for me.

1008
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,520
Ah, we did it.

1009
00:38:28,517 --> 00:38:29,857
[Jimmy] Oh!

1010
00:38:32,689 --> 00:38:35,029
<i>I'm super glad that
Jimmy and Pola</i>

1011
00:38:35,034 --> 00:38:36,554
<i>are on their mini date</i>

1012
00:38:36,551 --> 00:38:38,861
<i>because now I get
a chance to talk to Jose.</i>

1013
00:38:38,862 --> 00:38:40,142
He's like super-hot

1014
00:38:40,137 --> 00:38:41,757
and I'm hoping to get
to know him better.

1015
00:38:41,758 --> 00:38:43,068
I guess we're going
in the bedroom now

1016
00:38:43,068 --> 00:38:44,208
that your mom's gone.

1017
00:38:44,206 --> 00:38:45,406
[Jose] I guess so.

1018
00:38:45,413 --> 00:38:47,143
Kelle is very assertive,

1019
00:38:47,137 --> 00:38:50,067
very... very direct in
what she wants.

1020
00:38:50,068 --> 00:38:52,858
And I find that
attractive and sexy.

1021
00:38:52,862 --> 00:38:54,342
[Kelle] I've never gone paddleboarding.

1022
00:38:54,344 --> 00:38:55,484
[Jose] It's super fun.

1023
00:38:55,482 --> 00:38:56,862
I'll show you.
It's really cool.

1024
00:38:56,862 --> 00:38:58,212
I'll probably have to be
on my knees.

1025
00:38:59,344 --> 00:39:00,934
[Jose] Well, you can start
on your knees.

1026
00:39:02,137 --> 00:39:04,137
<i>I don't think that
my mom would approve,</i>

1027
00:39:04,137 --> 00:39:06,717
but I'm a grown man.
I don't need her approval.

1028
00:39:06,724 --> 00:39:08,934
But don't tell her
I said that.

1029
00:39:08,931 --> 00:39:10,311
I'm gonna tell Jimmy
to take your mom

1030
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:11,860
all the way over to
that island over there.

1031
00:39:11,862 --> 00:39:12,972
[laughter]

1032
00:39:12,965 --> 00:39:14,615
We'll stay there
for a couple of days.

1033
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,030
Pola, bye.

1034
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,720
Pola, I get
the fantasy suite tonight.

1035
00:39:20,724 --> 00:39:21,834
[Pola] Never.

1036
00:39:21,827 --> 00:39:24,307
Kelle is not the type of girl
for Jose.

1037
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:26,030
I'm 100% sure.

1038
00:39:26,034 --> 00:39:27,414
Do you see his body language?

1039
00:39:27,413 --> 00:39:28,553
- Look at it.
- [Pola] No.

1040
00:39:28,551 --> 00:39:29,931
Whether she likes it or not,

1041
00:39:29,931 --> 00:39:32,721
I'm gonna do whatever it takes
to take my man home.

1042
00:39:32,724 --> 00:39:33,864
I like to win.

1043
00:39:33,862 --> 00:39:35,072
Hey, Mom.

1044
00:39:35,068 --> 00:39:36,208
No, I can't.

1045
00:39:40,965 --> 00:39:42,685
- Can I steal you?
- Yeah, sure.

1046
00:39:42,689 --> 00:39:45,029
- Yeah.
I have a question for you.
- Sure.

1047
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:49,451
I've had my eye on Jose
from day one,

1048
00:39:49,448 --> 00:39:51,718
and I'm definitely
going for it.

1049
00:39:53,241 --> 00:39:55,341
So, have you ever
dated older women?

1050
00:39:55,344 --> 00:39:56,624
I don't think
I asked you that.

1051
00:39:56,620 --> 00:40:00,000
Yeah, I usually go for older.

1052
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,450
See, and I usually
attract younger men.

1053
00:40:02,448 --> 00:40:07,448
Her weak spot in my eyes
are accents, I think.

1054
00:40:07,448 --> 00:40:09,548
I think accents
really get her.

1055
00:40:09,551 --> 00:40:12,141
It doesn't matter
what you look like.

1056
00:40:12,137 --> 00:40:13,617
I think if you have an accent,

1057
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,660
you have a chance
with my mom.

1058
00:40:15,655 --> 00:40:16,855
You do.

1059
00:40:16,862 --> 00:40:18,312
[Kelle] <i>It's really
not about the accent.</i>

1060
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:20,380
<i>It's like they're raised
in a different country,</i>

1061
00:40:20,379 --> 00:40:22,759
so they have
a different demeanor

1062
00:40:22,758 --> 00:40:24,138
and they treat women differently.

1063
00:40:24,137 --> 00:40:25,277
Mm-hmm.

1064
00:40:25,275 --> 00:40:27,275
They just so happen
to have an accent.

1065
00:40:27,275 --> 00:40:29,585
I don't know why you're, like,
latched on this accent thing.

1066
00:40:29,586 --> 00:40:30,856
It's not about the accent.

1067
00:40:30,862 --> 00:40:33,692
That's just a bonus,
like, if you ask me.

1068
00:40:33,689 --> 00:40:35,309
Are you here...
what are you here for?

1069
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:37,790
- I guess I'm just curious.
- Okay.

1070
00:40:37,793 --> 00:40:40,383
I'm here for the same reason
as everybody else is,

1071
00:40:40,379 --> 00:40:46,659
I guess, to, um, go outside
of the culture values

1072
00:40:46,655 --> 00:40:49,445
that we have and explore

1073
00:40:49,448 --> 00:40:52,758
different opportunities,
different relationships,

1074
00:40:52,758 --> 00:40:54,378
different connections
with people

1075
00:40:54,379 --> 00:40:57,379
that we would never do before.

1076
00:40:57,379 --> 00:40:58,589
Am I putting you on the spot?

1077
00:40:58,586 --> 00:40:59,716
No. Not at all.

1078
00:40:59,724 --> 00:41:01,174
- I mean, on the contrary...
- Sorry.

1079
00:41:01,172 --> 00:41:02,452
...on the contrary, actually...

1080
00:41:02,448 --> 00:41:05,378
it's actually very,
very cool that...

1081
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:07,169
- I'm just curious.
- Yeah, yeah.

1082
00:41:07,172 --> 00:41:08,902
And I appreciate
your question.

1083
00:41:08,896 --> 00:41:10,546
Jose and I were
really connecting,

1084
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:12,101
as far as I'm concerned.

1085
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:15,343
<i>I think he moves very slowly,
which I don't like to do,</i>

1086
00:41:15,344 --> 00:41:18,524
but I feel like
there's a potential there.

1087
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:20,587
I would love to keep on going
with that conversation.

1088
00:41:20,586 --> 00:41:21,996
- [Kelle] Okay.
- For sure.

1089
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,760
I was feeling it, too.

1090
00:41:23,758 --> 00:41:25,758
[Charlene] <i>Who do I think
will hook up first?</i>

1091
00:41:25,758 --> 00:41:29,588
<i>I would probably say Kelle.</i>

1092
00:41:29,586 --> 00:41:32,656
Last night
she was all over Ryan.

1093
00:41:32,655 --> 00:41:34,095
<i>Now she's after Jose.</i>

1094
00:41:34,103 --> 00:41:35,933
But I expect that of her.

1095
00:41:35,931 --> 00:41:37,621
<i>She definitely wants to be</i>

1096
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,760
the belle of the ball
or the Barbie.

1097
00:41:39,758 --> 00:41:42,858
<i>But I think
that it's a little much,</i>

1098
00:41:42,862 --> 00:41:44,692
like this isn't a game show.

1099
00:41:44,689 --> 00:41:46,099
- [Pola] Salud.
- [Jimmy] Salud.

1100
00:41:46,103 --> 00:41:49,003
Oh. So I have to ask.

1101
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,240
- What?
- What is your type?

1102
00:41:52,241 --> 00:41:54,661
I really like men that like
to do things like

1103
00:41:54,655 --> 00:41:55,855
- what we just did.
- Uh-huh.

1104
00:41:55,862 --> 00:41:57,762
I don't like men
that just sit down on TV

1105
00:41:57,758 --> 00:41:59,588
and just watch TV
and do nothing.

1106
00:41:59,586 --> 00:42:01,096
- Yeah.
- [Pola] Yeah. What about you?

1107
00:42:01,103 --> 00:42:02,483
Oh, my type. Let's see.

1108
00:42:02,482 --> 00:42:04,522
What... what is my type?

1109
00:42:04,517 --> 00:42:06,137
- I like dark hair.
- [Pola] You do?

1110
00:42:06,137 --> 00:42:08,167
[Jimmy] <i>Good teeth,
good smile.</i>

1111
00:42:08,172 --> 00:42:11,002
Being with Pola,
I feel super comfortable.

1112
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,410
I'm not even thinking of age.

1113
00:42:12,413 --> 00:42:14,243
It just feels very good
and fluid,

1114
00:42:14,241 --> 00:42:15,791
and there's no worries
in the world

1115
00:42:15,793 --> 00:42:17,173
and we can just be ourselves.

1116
00:42:17,172 --> 00:42:18,662
I prefer darker complexion
with green eyes.

1117
00:42:18,655 --> 00:42:19,825
[Pola] You do?

1118
00:42:19,827 --> 00:42:20,997
- Green... green...
- Me too.

1119
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,280
Yeah.
Green is my favorite color.

1120
00:42:22,275 --> 00:42:23,405
- Yeah, me too.
- Oh, yeah.

1121
00:42:23,413 --> 00:42:24,723
- And dark hair.
- Mm-hmm.

1122
00:42:24,724 --> 00:42:26,104
I don't like blonds.

1123
00:42:26,103 --> 00:42:28,073
If I would've got green eyes,
it would've been over.

1124
00:42:28,068 --> 00:42:29,278
[Pola]
That would've been perfect.

1125
00:42:29,275 --> 00:42:30,925
That would've been over
for the world.

1126
00:42:30,931 --> 00:42:33,861
I totally feel
a great connection with Jimmy

1127
00:42:33,862 --> 00:42:37,072
and I feel really good about
myself with him.

1128
00:42:37,068 --> 00:42:38,518
Who do you think Jose likes?

1129
00:42:38,517 --> 00:42:39,717
Anybody...
interested in anybody?

1130
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:40,834
- Not really?
- Not yet.

1131
00:42:40,827 --> 00:42:41,997
- Not yet?
- No.

1132
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,830
It takes him a little time
to build up a little?

1133
00:42:43,827 --> 00:42:45,517
No, I would see it.

1134
00:42:45,517 --> 00:42:47,897
I don't see his eyes like
shining for anyone.

1135
00:42:47,896 --> 00:42:49,616
- Mm-hmm.
- No.

1136
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:51,310
Do you see my eyes shining
for anybody?

1137
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:52,620
- Mmm, yeah.
- Okay. All right.

1138
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:53,830
[laughs]

1139
00:42:53,827 --> 00:42:55,787
Oh, la-la.

1140
00:42:55,793 --> 00:42:57,593
- We was paddleboarding.
- [Jose] I did see it.

1141
00:42:57,586 --> 00:42:59,336
[Kelle] It doesn't look like
paddleboarding to me.

1142
00:42:59,344 --> 00:43:00,484
[Pola] We did.

1143
00:43:00,482 --> 00:43:02,142
[Jimmy] It's not
what it looks like, I swear.

1144
00:43:02,137 --> 00:43:04,167
[Pola] It was really fun.
You want rose, Jose?

1145
00:43:04,172 --> 00:43:05,722
[Jimmy] We'll bring you
some rose, Jose.

1146
00:43:05,724 --> 00:43:07,034
- No, no, no.
- Beautiful, thank you.

1147
00:43:07,034 --> 00:43:08,724
No, drink up.

1148
00:43:08,724 --> 00:43:10,034
We have our own rose.

1149
00:43:10,034 --> 00:43:13,524
Pola, I get
the fantasy suite tonight.

1150
00:43:13,517 --> 00:43:14,827
[Pola] You don't.

1151
00:43:14,827 --> 00:43:17,997
You actually don't. Never.

1152
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,590
I don't really know
Kelle a lot,

1153
00:43:20,586 --> 00:43:22,716
but what I see
and what I feel,

1154
00:43:22,724 --> 00:43:26,074
she's really wild,
and I really believe

1155
00:43:26,068 --> 00:43:30,478
she's gonna bring drama
to my family, to my son,

1156
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:31,722
and to the relationship

1157
00:43:31,724 --> 00:43:33,834
I have between
Jose and myself.

1158
00:43:33,827 --> 00:43:37,167
So I don't think
she's the good catch for Jose.

1159
00:43:37,172 --> 00:43:38,482
No.

1160
00:43:38,482 --> 00:43:39,792
What if Jose falls in love
with Kelle?

1161
00:43:39,793 --> 00:43:41,003
No, he won't.

1162
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,550
[Jimmy] You see
his body language, though.

1163
00:43:42,551 --> 00:43:43,691
- Look at it.
- [Pola] No.

1164
00:43:43,689 --> 00:43:45,069
[Jimmy] It's talking.
It's talking to me.

1165
00:43:45,068 --> 00:43:46,688
[Pola] No.
No, I know it's not.

1166
00:43:46,689 --> 00:43:48,659
- I know him.
- Oh, okay.

1167
00:43:48,655 --> 00:43:50,235
Look how close
he is to her face.

1168
00:43:50,241 --> 00:43:52,721
- That's an intimate...
- [Pola] Not okay, no.

1169
00:43:52,724 --> 00:43:56,074
Pola makes it very clear that
she just does not like Kelle.

1170
00:43:56,068 --> 00:43:57,588
<i>So if Kelle wants Jose,</i>

1171
00:43:57,586 --> 00:43:59,996
I'm thinking that Kelle's
gonna have to either,

1172
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,760
one, go through Pola
or two go around her back.

1173
00:44:03,758 --> 00:44:05,928
Kelle.
Kelle without the Y.

1174
00:44:05,931 --> 00:44:07,481
Kelle with an E.

1175
00:44:07,482 --> 00:44:10,902
I think Jose is open to love
and I'm gonna show him

1176
00:44:10,896 --> 00:44:12,546
that I'm the one
he should be with.

1177
00:44:13,793 --> 00:44:15,763
- You're mine.
- You like tall men?

1178
00:44:17,241 --> 00:44:19,551
- I like confident men.
- Okay.

1179
00:44:19,551 --> 00:44:22,141
There's something going on
between me and her.

1180
00:44:22,137 --> 00:44:25,307
That could be the start
of something very powerful.

1181
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:27,860
Jose likes very, like,
quiet girls, nice girls.

1182
00:44:27,862 --> 00:44:28,972
Mmm.

1183
00:44:28,965 --> 00:44:31,405
Kelle is not the type
of girl for Jose.

1184
00:44:31,413 --> 00:44:33,453
I'm 100% sure.

1185
00:44:33,448 --> 00:44:36,028
<i>So she's not gonna get
anywhere with Jose. Never.</i>

1186
00:44:37,517 --> 00:44:39,547
- That's not Jose's style.
- I'm saying--

1187
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:42,621
- That won't happen.
- Hey, Mom.

1188
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:46,210
I'm not sure
if Pola is embracing
this whole situation.

1189
00:44:46,206 --> 00:44:48,756
<i>Like, I thought she came
here to date a younger guy,</i>

1190
00:44:48,758 --> 00:44:49,928
<i>not her son.</i>

1191
00:44:49,931 --> 00:44:52,141
But whether
she likes it or not,

1192
00:44:52,137 --> 00:44:54,617
<i>I'm gonna do whatever
it takes to take my man home.</i>

1193
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:57,030
So there is no competition, babe.

1194
00:44:57,034 --> 00:44:58,934
If I had a date,
would you want to go with me?

1195
00:44:58,931 --> 00:45:00,241
Sure.

1196
00:45:00,241 --> 00:45:01,521
I like to win.

1197
00:45:03,413 --> 00:45:05,483
- [Pola] <i>It won't happen.</i>
- [Jimmy] <i>But what if?</i>

1198
00:45:05,482 --> 00:45:07,002
No, I can't.
