1
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:14,503
Being here and seeing this
beautiful sunset and how
beautiful you look,

2
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,730
this is a really special
moment as well.

3
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,100
[Shannan] <i>I feel like Jose may</i>

4
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,030
give everyone
that kind of attention.

5
00:00:21,033 --> 00:00:22,373
So, you don't know
if you're special.

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,930
I feel like I'm a teenager
again with Billy.

7
00:00:25,933 --> 00:00:28,703
<i>Sneaking around the whole
house, hiding from his mom.</i>

8
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,500
No, I'm going to go in there.

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,700
There is no way I'm going
to let Kelle corrupt Billy.

10
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,170
Not in my suite.

11
00:00:36,167 --> 00:00:37,527
[Stefany] I'm going to be
like, "You've got to go."

12
00:00:39,467 --> 00:00:41,927
<i>Really? In our sauna?</i>

13
00:00:41,933 --> 00:00:43,833
Oh, you're the baby.

14
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:45,203
You're going to be 22, right?

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,800
I'm going to be 22.

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,300
Oh!

17
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,100
April is the woman who
immediately caught my eye.

18
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,930
I would have never thought
that I would be here

19
00:00:54,933 --> 00:00:57,003
with such a beautiful woman.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,270
The new Ryan wants
to take me out.

21
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:00,227
[Gabriel] That's annoying.

22
00:01:00,233 --> 00:01:01,473
Do you still love me?

23
00:01:01,467 --> 00:01:04,097
[Ryan S] <i>Stefany and Gabriel
really have a connection.</i>

24
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,900
I'm not going to put
my eggs in that basket.

25
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,330
- Have you told Gabriel that...
- [Stefany] He knows!

26
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:09,773
- he's just a friend?
- He knows!

27
00:01:09,767 --> 00:01:12,697
- You're lying.
- He and I are good friends.

28
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,070
This love triangle has just
gotten way out of hand.

29
00:01:16,067 --> 00:01:18,897
He got mad because
you laying on the couch,

30
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,070
you were leaning over.

31
00:01:20,067 --> 00:01:22,427
- [Gabriel] Are you
his girlfriend?
- No!

32
00:01:22,433 --> 00:01:25,773
I haven't made a decision
with anybody here.

33
00:01:25,767 --> 00:01:28,227
[Gabriel] Bro, Stefany
and I have been vibing.

34
00:01:28,233 --> 00:01:30,333
You're the only one
causing a problem here.

35
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:32,233
I don't care about your thing!

36
00:01:32,233 --> 00:01:33,603
Ryan, you are
so disrespectful.

37
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,600
You channeled this.

38
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,230
You're a liar and that's bull.

39
00:01:36,233 --> 00:01:37,773
You're 45, you are
too old to be doing this.

40
00:01:37,767 --> 00:01:40,167
Okay, no. I am too old
to be dealing with this.

41
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:42,497
I'm over it. I just know
what works for me.

42
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,900
<i>And Stefany doesn't
work for me.</i>

43
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,567
[upbeat music playing]

44
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,770
[Kelle] Jimmy. Jimmy.

45
00:02:01,767 --> 00:02:03,427
You look like Michael Phelps.

46
00:02:03,433 --> 00:02:04,703
[Kelle laughing]

47
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,270
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

48
00:02:08,133 --> 00:02:09,833
Drink it! Drink it! Drink it!

49
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:10,703
That's good.

50
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:14,597
[Jose] So, you're cool, bro?
Anything new?

51
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,730
[Kelle] I feel like you guys
are fighting over Stef.

52
00:02:16,733 --> 00:02:18,073
I feel like, no, we're not.

53
00:02:18,067 --> 00:02:19,297
[Kelle laughs]

54
00:02:20,633 --> 00:02:22,633
Last night was kind of, a lot.

55
00:02:22,633 --> 00:02:26,173
<i>This like, love triangle thing
going on with Stefany.</i>

56
00:02:26,167 --> 00:02:28,067
[April] <i>There was plenty
of volcanoes,</i>

57
00:02:28,067 --> 00:02:30,597
like, exploding.
Like, everywhere.

58
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,230
[Ryan S] <i>I think
I'm going to, you know,</i>

59
00:02:32,233 --> 00:02:34,333
<i>make sure to take
my time, figure out</i>

60
00:02:34,933 --> 00:02:36,903
who's interested in who.

61
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,830
Like, what are the established
relationships here.

62
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,933
I don't want to step
on anybody's toes.

63
00:02:41,933 --> 00:02:43,603
I want to figure out, okay,

64
00:02:44,367 --> 00:02:47,597
who's fair game here,
you know?

65
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,400
[Billy] I was like, what?

66
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,970
That's the highlight
of my trip.

67
00:02:54,067 --> 00:02:54,897
Having a little...

68
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,600
He's more so, just jealous.

69
00:02:59,067 --> 00:03:00,797
[Gabriel] I don't know.
I don't like making
enemies though.

70
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,900
That kind of doesn't
sit right with me.

71
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,200
[Billy] Making
enemies is fine.

72
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,200
After last night,

73
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,070
final straw, I mean.

74
00:03:07,067 --> 00:03:09,567
Stefany's definitely
over Ryan, like,

75
00:03:09,567 --> 00:03:11,067
I think it was a little...

76
00:03:11,067 --> 00:03:12,627
I think
he embarrassed himself.

77
00:03:12,633 --> 00:03:15,803
<i>Now, I got a mature,
put together woman.</i>

78
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,870
<i>I'm excited to see
this friendship</i>

79
00:03:17,867 --> 00:03:19,797
<i>blossoming into
something more.</i>

80
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,230
I'm like, "Victory, baby."

81
00:03:27,567 --> 00:03:29,627
Every time I asked her,

82
00:03:29,633 --> 00:03:31,073
that we're going to spend
more time together.

83
00:03:31,067 --> 00:03:34,527
- We're going to pursue
anything with each other,
- [Kelle] Oh!

84
00:03:34,533 --> 00:03:36,733
did you let that
be known to him?

85
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,530
That's the issue.

86
00:03:38,533 --> 00:03:40,273
Every time I asked
her that question,

87
00:03:41,233 --> 00:03:42,573
it's never a straight answer.

88
00:03:42,567 --> 00:03:46,197
I definitely think that
we're at the end of the road

89
00:03:46,733 --> 00:03:47,803
with Stefany.

90
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,970
<i>Stefany could care
less about Ryan's feelings.</i>

91
00:03:52,067 --> 00:03:53,227
- You know, "Woe is me.
- Right.

92
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,373
I'm just over here being
friends with everyone."

93
00:03:55,367 --> 00:03:57,667
- No, you're not, Polly Ann.
I know you're not.
- Right.

94
00:03:57,667 --> 00:04:00,267
[Ryan] <i>This is more about
principle to me than anything.</i>

95
00:04:00,267 --> 00:04:02,467
<i>Lying is big to me.
Can't do it.</i>

96
00:04:02,467 --> 00:04:03,697
<i>It's triggering.</i>

97
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,630
It's like, check the box
and move on.

98
00:04:06,633 --> 00:04:09,633
- And that's where he's at.
- Pretty much.

99
00:04:09,633 --> 00:04:11,373
But I understand that
we're here to date,

100
00:04:11,367 --> 00:04:13,927
and that's kind of, sort of
what I'm re-emphasizing.

101
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:16,533
I go on a date
with his mom, right?

102
00:04:16,533 --> 00:04:17,733
- Pola on a date.
- [Kelle] Yeah.

103
00:04:17,733 --> 00:04:19,373
- We had a great conversation.
- [Kelle] Yeah.

104
00:04:19,367 --> 00:04:20,627
There was chemistry there.

105
00:04:20,633 --> 00:04:22,603
You like the Latin mummies.

106
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,530
[Ryan] I don't know.
<i>Mas que para tu.</i>

107
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:26,633
<i>Mas que para tu</i> now.

108
00:04:30,767 --> 00:04:32,767
I, a hundred percent know
who I'm going next.

109
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,230
I came, I saw, I conquered.

110
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:41,233
There's something that
me and Jose always say.

111
00:04:41,233 --> 00:04:44,073
When you see someone
that is maybe sad

112
00:04:44,067 --> 00:04:45,267
or he's not smiling,

113
00:04:45,267 --> 00:04:49,067
or for any reason,
he's not having a good day.

114
00:04:49,067 --> 00:04:50,727
If you smile at him,

115
00:04:50,733 --> 00:04:53,103
I'm sure that person is going
to smile back to you.

116
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,270
- Of course!
- And that is a good
change for him that day.

117
00:04:56,167 --> 00:04:57,427
[Pola] Ryan.

118
00:04:57,433 --> 00:04:59,303
What are you all
doing over here?

119
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,370
She's waiting for you
to... Moscow?

120
00:05:02,367 --> 00:05:04,197
- Is it Moscow time?
- Yes!

121
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,700
[Ryan] <i>Now that it's a wrap
on Stefany,</i>

122
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,670
pretty much,
there's always been

123
00:05:08,667 --> 00:05:11,527
a spark between me and Pola.

124
00:05:11,533 --> 00:05:13,073
<i>You know, there have been
times when she's been</i>

125
00:05:13,067 --> 00:05:14,697
<i>a little bit closed off.</i>

126
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,530
More than I would
like for her to be.

127
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:19,833
But I do think that if I,
you know, slow down a bit,

128
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,333
put in some time and energy,

129
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,773
and effort into
getting to know Pola,

130
00:05:23,767 --> 00:05:25,527
a little better,

131
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,473
I think that there may
be something there,
something special.

132
00:05:31,633 --> 00:05:34,203
[Pola] <i>So, my heart really
hurts for Ryan right now.</i>

133
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,170
What I really feel is that
Stefany is playing
a lot of games.

134
00:05:37,167 --> 00:05:39,597
<i>But I'm relieved that
he's out of there</i>

135
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,800
<i>because Ryan is one
of my favorite.</i>

136
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,200
<i>I do miss him.</i>

137
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,730
<i>The thing is that,
he wanted to go very fast.</i>

138
00:05:46,467 --> 00:05:47,897
<i>And he wanted to kiss me.</i>

139
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,900
<i>I was not ready for that.</i>

140
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,670
But I'm sure he realized that.

141
00:05:56,667 --> 00:06:00,267
And maybe we can start things
again, me and him.

142
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:08,367
No, it's probably more
than friendship.

143
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:09,867
But with his mom...

144
00:06:11,633 --> 00:06:13,903
I want to make sure
she's not listening.

145
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,070
[Kelle] <i>I think he's more
guarded because she's here.</i>

146
00:06:17,067 --> 00:06:18,927
<i>Billy's great
but he's definitely</i>

147
00:06:18,933 --> 00:06:20,173
not my number one.

148
00:06:20,167 --> 00:06:21,767
Jose's always been
my number one.

149
00:06:21,767 --> 00:06:23,527
<i>But Billy shows me a lot
of attention.</i>

150
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:25,703
<i>And Jose is like,
laissez-faire.</i>

151
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,330
Like, he's just like,
chatting with everybody.

152
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,173
<i>I don't really know
where his head's at.</i>

153
00:06:30,167 --> 00:06:34,097
But if Jose shows me that
there is an opportunity
to hang out,

154
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,700
I'm definitely hanging
out with him.

155
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:40,070
But you kind of threw me off
because of your secret.

156
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:41,867
- Oh, in the Well of Secrecy?
- Yeah.

157
00:06:42,633 --> 00:06:43,833
<i>So, mine was,</i>

158
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:46,373
<i>I had a quickie in a yacht
with a girl I just met.</i>

159
00:06:46,367 --> 00:06:48,667
[exclaiming and laughing]

160
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:50,397
[Kelle] So, your secret
to me seems like,

161
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,400
you have, like, a little
bit of a wild side.

162
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,870
[Jose] That was
a one-time thing.

163
00:06:53,867 --> 00:06:55,727
Well, you don't know.
It could be a two-time thing.

164
00:06:55,733 --> 00:06:56,703
[Jose] Well, yeah, sure.

165
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,070
- That's the Jose
I'm curious about.
- Okay.

166
00:06:59,067 --> 00:07:01,627
[Jose] <i>Every time I have a new
conversation with Kelle,</i>

167
00:07:01,633 --> 00:07:04,703
I see different things
about her that...

168
00:07:06,167 --> 00:07:09,097
...maybe are igniting
that interest.

169
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,500
- They love it. They love it.
- Oh, you're so, so good.

170
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:14,733
[phone beeping]

171
00:07:14,733 --> 00:07:15,703
[Pola] Hey, guys!

172
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,100
I got a text!

173
00:07:17,467 --> 00:07:18,667
"Hello, men.

174
00:07:18,667 --> 00:07:20,297
How good are you
with your hands?

175
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,470
In a two-minute blind massage,

176
00:07:22,467 --> 00:07:24,827
it's time for the women
to judge that.

177
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:28,203
The winner will get
a special date night."

178
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,700
[all cheering]

179
00:07:32,367 --> 00:07:35,067
I feel great about going
into this challenge.

180
00:07:35,067 --> 00:07:36,497
I feel like I give
good massages.

181
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,500
- I have strong hands.
- Look at those hands.

182
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,470
I know all the spots where
the girls want to get
you know, massaged.

183
00:07:41,467 --> 00:07:42,667
[Charlene] <i>You've got to know
what you're doing.</i>

184
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:43,627
<i>I need the hands.</i>

185
00:07:43,633 --> 00:07:45,273
Manhandle me, please.

186
00:07:45,267 --> 00:07:46,927
Not my son, but somebody.

187
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,430
[Shannan] <i>We de-robe.</i>

188
00:07:53,433 --> 00:07:54,603
<i>We get settled.</i>

189
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,070
Nice and comfortable.

190
00:07:57,367 --> 00:07:59,067
<i>We are all blindfolded.</i>

191
00:08:00,067 --> 00:08:02,197
<i>The boys are all blindfolded.</i>

192
00:08:03,433 --> 00:08:08,073
<i>So, we have no idea
who's where.</i>

193
00:08:08,067 --> 00:08:11,297
<i>So, each one of the sons
are given two minutes</i>

194
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,170
<i>to massage whoever's
in front of them.</i>

195
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:16,397
<i>And then, the women
will be scoring</i>

196
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,900
<i>on a scale of one to five.</i>

197
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,870
Let the rubbing begin.

198
00:08:26,167 --> 00:08:28,227
[Ryan S] <i>I think
we're blindfolded,</i>

199
00:08:28,233 --> 00:08:32,073
so that there's just equal
footing between all the guys.

200
00:08:32,067 --> 00:08:35,327
You don't know if you're
massaging your own mom.

201
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:37,703
I'm really concerned
that, you know,

202
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,530
not having my eyes is going
to make it really hard

203
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:42,973
to figure out kind of,
what's going on.

204
00:08:43,067 --> 00:08:46,827
<i>Like, there's definitely
the possibility of...</i>

205
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:49,073
<i>...you know,
touching</i> x <i>a few assets.</i>

206
00:08:49,067 --> 00:08:52,067
<i>And I'm not going to be able
to tell until I'm there.</i>

207
00:08:52,067 --> 00:08:53,367
[Lisa] <i>I'm very excited.</i>

208
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:54,667
I don't care who massages me.

209
00:08:55,267 --> 00:08:56,327
Just, yes.

210
00:08:57,367 --> 00:08:58,667
[Lisa] Yup, yup.

211
00:08:58,667 --> 00:08:59,527
That's it.

212
00:09:01,933 --> 00:09:04,573
[moaning]

213
00:09:04,567 --> 00:09:05,797
[Lisa] Oh, my gosh.

214
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,900
There is nothing hotter

215
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:12,570
than being massaged
by eight young men.

216
00:09:12,567 --> 00:09:13,927
[Lisa] Oh, yeah.

217
00:09:13,933 --> 00:09:15,233
Oh!

218
00:09:15,767 --> 00:09:16,627
Oh, my God.

219
00:09:17,133 --> 00:09:17,973
Don't stop.

220
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,570
[Kelle] <i>What the hell
is going on over there?</i>

221
00:09:22,567 --> 00:09:24,097
[Lisa] Yeah. Oh.

222
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,430
If Lisa's getting a happy
ending and I'm not,

223
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:27,403
I'm going to be pissed.

224
00:09:28,633 --> 00:09:30,373
Oh, yeah. Oh!

225
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,097
I feel like I'm doing good
in this challenge.

226
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,430
I feel like the moms
is giving me good feedback.

227
00:09:34,433 --> 00:09:35,473
<i>They're enjoying it.</i>

228
00:09:36,433 --> 00:09:37,303
[Lisa] So good.

229
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,530
I'm vocal when
I'm enjoying myself.

230
00:09:39,533 --> 00:09:41,833
<i>So, I would say a five.</i>

231
00:09:42,767 --> 00:09:43,767
[woman moaning] Yes!

232
00:09:44,767 --> 00:09:46,127
Yes!

233
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:48,273
[Charlene] There you go.

234
00:09:49,633 --> 00:09:50,903
Get in there.

235
00:09:52,567 --> 00:09:55,467
I feel like chicken hands
are massaging me right now.

236
00:09:55,467 --> 00:09:57,427
<i>Come on! That's all you got?</i>

237
00:09:57,433 --> 00:10:00,073
Really? This person is a one.

238
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:01,127
[woman moaning]

239
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,530
[Billy] <i>I didn't obviously
know who I was giving
a massage to.</i>

240
00:10:08,533 --> 00:10:10,473
<i>But she gave me like,
no reaction.</i>

241
00:10:10,467 --> 00:10:12,767
Like, she was like,
dead quiet.

242
00:10:12,767 --> 00:10:17,467
Um, made me feel like I wasn't
doing that great of a job.

243
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,373
[Kelle] <i>I'm going
to give this guy a one.</i>

244
00:10:21,367 --> 00:10:23,727
I mean, I feel
like he's so timid,

245
00:10:23,733 --> 00:10:25,473
he's never even touched
a woman before.

246
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,730
[Timmy] <i>So, my technique is,</i>

247
00:10:29,733 --> 00:10:32,533
I spray down my whole
body before I start.

248
00:10:32,533 --> 00:10:34,433
<i>I like to lather up.</i>

249
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:37,973
A lot of people
would be scared to go
for the booty and back.

250
00:10:37,967 --> 00:10:39,897
So, I knew if I really
lather myself up,

251
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,200
and get in there like this,

252
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,330
and come back and forth
like I'm rowing a ship.

253
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:49,530
<i>And then, come back and pull
all that energy through,</i>

254
00:10:49,533 --> 00:10:51,233
it's like, a carpet ride.

255
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,233
You know, I'm Aladdin on it
and they're the carpet.

256
00:10:54,233 --> 00:10:56,003
I found my new roommate.

257
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,030
Oh, yeah.

258
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,773
[Soyoung] <i>I've been
massaging Jimmy</i>

259
00:11:00,767 --> 00:11:02,067
ever since he was young.

260
00:11:02,067 --> 00:11:05,527
When he get up in the morning,
I massage his feet, his legs.

261
00:11:05,533 --> 00:11:07,673
[Jimmy] <i>So, touch
is my love language.</i>

262
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,067
And I learned that
from a young age.

263
00:11:10,067 --> 00:11:11,067
[Kelle] Oh, yeah.

264
00:11:12,633 --> 00:11:13,803
What if this is Joey?

265
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,470
[Kelle] <i>This is definitely
a five.</i>

266
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:17,327
This guy's a winner. I would
love to go on a date,

267
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,373
whoever this is.

268
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,373
[woman moaning]

269
00:11:22,633 --> 00:11:24,773
That's it. Right there, baby.

270
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,567
Oh, yeah.

271
00:11:27,667 --> 00:11:29,367
[moans]

272
00:11:29,367 --> 00:11:31,867
[Gabriel] <i>Right now, I think
I'm massaging my mom's back.</i>

273
00:11:31,867 --> 00:11:34,097
It is a little uncomfortable.

274
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,070
[April moans]

275
00:11:36,067 --> 00:11:37,197
Baby!

276
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,330
[Gabriel] <i>I was like, damn.</i>

277
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,803
I kind of want to throw up
a little bit.

278
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,700
This guy knows
what he's doing.

279
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,370
<i>This person's definitely
getting a five.</i>

280
00:11:46,367 --> 00:11:47,467
I hope it's Joey.

281
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,730
That was a work-out.

282
00:11:53,867 --> 00:11:55,497
I started sweating.

283
00:11:58,233 --> 00:11:59,703
[Charlene] I've got
to tell you guys,

284
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,870
you could tell a lot
about a massage.

285
00:12:01,867 --> 00:12:03,927
Just saying!

286
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:07,733
And I'm so glad I had no idea
about you or anything.

287
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,430
[phone vibrating]

288
00:12:09,433 --> 00:12:11,173
We have a winner, guys.

289
00:12:11,167 --> 00:12:13,527
[all cheering]

290
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:16,803
Congratulations to...

291
00:12:18,067 --> 00:12:19,467
[dramatic music playing]

292
00:12:21,133 --> 00:12:23,903
[moans] Love it. Yes.

293
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,070
[Joey] I just think April
would be my girl.

294
00:12:26,067 --> 00:12:27,227
Even though I'm young,

295
00:12:27,233 --> 00:12:30,073
she says I have more
of an old soul.

296
00:12:30,067 --> 00:12:31,927
I'll be around
for the rest of your life.

297
00:12:33,433 --> 00:12:34,773
[Gabriel laughing]

298
00:12:34,767 --> 00:12:36,697
[Kelle] <i>Billy is more
concerned about</i>

299
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,830
what his mom thinks.

300
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:41,273
But I'm not letting
anyone stop me.

301
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,700
We have a winner.

302
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,170
Congratulations to...

303
00:12:55,767 --> 00:12:58,227
- Jimmy!
- [all cheering]

304
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,800
[Jimmy] <i>I knew
I had this in the bag</i>

305
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,100
because in my past,
I've given out more massages

306
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,800
<i>than I can really count
on these hands.</i>

307
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,530
But it's not the only thing
I'm probably good with.

308
00:13:10,533 --> 00:13:13,133
[Stefany] You get to pick
one of the women

309
00:13:13,133 --> 00:13:15,473
for a special date tonight.

310
00:13:15,467 --> 00:13:17,697
I really want to take
a special woman out tonight.

311
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,600
I haven't gone on a date
with her yet.

312
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,170
And I'm really looking
forward to Charlene.

313
00:13:22,167 --> 00:13:24,397
- Oh!
- [all cheering]

314
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,170
[Charlene] <i>Yeah, I'm really
excited Jimmy picked me.</i>

315
00:13:28,167 --> 00:13:31,367
<i>I didn't really have success
with Jose but I'm excited.</i>

316
00:13:31,367 --> 00:13:32,697
I think they're going
to have a really good time.

317
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,430
More massage, please.

318
00:13:35,433 --> 00:13:38,603
But I don't want it
to escalate and lead
to a better time.

319
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,100
Oh, well, gee, thanks.

320
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,300
That's really reassuring.

321
00:13:42,533 --> 00:13:44,103
Oh!

322
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,070
[Charlene squealing]

323
00:13:46,067 --> 00:13:48,697
[Jimmy] <i>I asked Charlene out
after winning this challenge</i>

324
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,270
because I think
she's beautiful, one.

325
00:13:51,267 --> 00:13:52,827
Two, I think
she is very funny.

326
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,973
<i>And three, I think she's like,
open to finding love.</i>

327
00:13:56,067 --> 00:13:56,967
Nice!

328
00:13:57,067 --> 00:13:58,927
[Harrison] I want her
back by 10:00 o'clock.

[all laughing]

330
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,270
- [Charlene] Aw, Harrison.
- [Timmy] We'll bring
you leftovers.

331
00:14:02,267 --> 00:14:04,327
Open the door for her,
you know what I mean.

332
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,603
[Timmy] Pull the chair,

333
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,100
- open the door.
- [Harrison] Pull the chair.

334
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,370
Button the bra,
unbutton the bra.

335

[boys exclaiming]

336
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,070
I've never unbuttoned
a bra blindfolded.

337
00:14:14,067 --> 00:14:16,867
[laughing and exclaiming]

338
00:14:16,867 --> 00:14:19,467
This sounds really juicy.

339

[Jose] Congratulations,
Jimmy and Charlene.

- Jimmy and Charlene!

Oh, of course.

342
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,900
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it is.

343
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,330
[Ryan S] First baby
in the family.

344
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:40,873
Oh yeah, that.

345
00:14:40,867 --> 00:14:43,397
- That baby is going
to be so spoilt.
- Yeah.

346
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,170
[Pola] That's fine,
and that's great.

347
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:46,327
[Ryan S] <i>I'm kind
of disappointed</i>

348
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:48,533
<i>when I didn't win this
massage challenge.</i>

349
00:14:48,533 --> 00:14:49,933
Would have been nice
to get the opportunity

350
00:14:49,933 --> 00:14:51,503
to take Pola out on a date.

351
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,830
<i>She seems so down
to earth and sweet.</i>

352
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:56,833
A little different from a lot
of the rest of the ladies.

353
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,333
<i>Maybe someone I want
to get to know better.</i>

354
00:14:58,333 --> 00:14:59,903
<i>See if we have attraction.</i>

355
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:02,167
[Ryan S] I already started
putting some money into
a college fund for her.

356
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:03,127
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

357
00:15:03,133 --> 00:15:04,773
Oh, that's amazing to hear.

358
00:15:04,767 --> 00:15:07,567
That's like, the first
Christmas gift, basically.

359
00:15:07,567 --> 00:15:09,497
It was like, okay,
I'll send you like, a doll

360
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,500
because you'll have that
and you'll have that forever,

361
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,300
- but, you know,
I'm good for the money.
- Wow!

362
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,830
- That's super nice to hear.
- Yup.

363
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,073
[Pola] <i>Family is
the most valuable thing</i>

364
00:15:18,067 --> 00:15:19,567
<i>that a human being can have.</i>

365
00:15:19,567 --> 00:15:22,597
<i>I think Ryan is like,
a family guy, too.</i>

366
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,500
And it's something
that attracts me.

367
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,300
[Ryan S] I mean, I just want
to see they're taken care of.

368
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,770
And like, you know,
get an education.

369
00:15:31,767 --> 00:15:34,067
The most important part
of a human being

370
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:35,897
is to be well educated.

371
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,330
So, if you can help with that,

372
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,333
That's amazing, for you
to think about that.

373
00:15:39,867 --> 00:15:40,767
Thank you.

374
00:15:42,133 --> 00:15:43,233
What is this? Wine?

375
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,333
- [Ryan S] Rose, yeah.
- Yeah, the rose.

376
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:45,303
I like a sweet wine.

377
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,470
You do? I don't.

378
00:15:46,467 --> 00:15:48,667
- No?
- No, I like Moscato.

379
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:50,297
- I drink Moscato.
A lot of Moscato.
- I like Moscato.

380
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,400
[both laughing]

381
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,500
Glass of wine, tequila.

382
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,530
I like to drink
a little bit, yeah.

383
00:15:57,633 --> 00:15:58,903
Um...

384
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,070
[laughs]

385
00:16:01,067 --> 00:16:02,467
[Ryan] <i>I think Ryan's
very mature.</i>

386
00:16:02,467 --> 00:16:03,397
<i>Very polished.</i>

387
00:16:04,367 --> 00:16:05,497
Very intelligent.

388
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,700
Those are qualities that
attract a lot of older women.

389
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,070
<i>That could potentially
be a problem.</i>

390
00:16:10,067 --> 00:16:12,227
<i>But I have a lot of confidence
in myself.</i>

391
00:16:12,233 --> 00:16:15,073
And the impression
that I'm making on Pola.

392
00:16:16,533 --> 00:16:18,503
Hey. Nice jacket, bro.

393
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,670
[Pola] Yeah, you look cool.

394
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:21,097
Yeah? I love it.

395
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,530
Do I need to change?

396
00:16:23,533 --> 00:16:24,533
[Pola] Okay, so,
stay like that.

397
00:16:24,533 --> 00:16:25,703
- Should I just--
- You look very nice.

398
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,300
[Ryan] How would
you prefer me?

399
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,470
Just the way you are.

400
00:16:28,467 --> 00:16:30,627
Just the way I am?
That is such
a nice thing to say.

401
00:16:30,633 --> 00:16:33,073
[Pola] Just the way you are,
and the way your mom is.

402
00:16:33,067 --> 00:16:35,667
It seems like all the women
that I'm interested in

403
00:16:35,667 --> 00:16:38,327
already have made
some connection.

404
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:39,803
<i>At the rate that
things are going,</i>

405
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,370
<i>I think I'm going to need
to put myself out there.</i>

406
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:43,967
It would be great
to find love here

407
00:16:44,067 --> 00:16:45,497
and I'm not giving up yet.

408
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,370
[Ryan] Hand hug, you forgot.

409
00:16:47,367 --> 00:16:49,327
No, no, no, no, no.
Opposite, opposite.

410
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,073
Because you hug
with the other, loop.

411
00:16:51,067 --> 00:16:53,867
I have never met somebody that
high-fives as much as Pola.

412
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:55,573
[chuckles]

413
00:16:55,567 --> 00:16:57,527
That's just her thing.
That's her niche.

414
00:16:57,533 --> 00:16:59,073
<i>I think it's cute.
It's playful.</i>

415
00:16:59,067 --> 00:17:01,067
So, you know, I like it.

416
00:17:01,067 --> 00:17:02,397
I'll see you.

417
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,400
[Pola] I'm going
to go outside.

418
00:17:06,967 --> 00:17:07,927
[Harrison] Wow,
you look great.

419
00:17:08,767 --> 00:17:10,697
- Thank you.
- Turn to your right.

420
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,970
So, I'm super excited
about my date.

421
00:17:13,067 --> 00:17:14,927
I know. He's a good guy.

422
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:17,703
Yeah. He's intelligent, too.
He's just intelligent.

423
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,730
[Harrison] All right,
well, I love you.

424
00:17:18,733 --> 00:17:19,773
Have fun.

425
00:17:19,767 --> 00:17:21,697
Blessings, then.

426
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,430
[Harrison] <i>I'm pretty excited
Jimmy's taking my mom out.</i>

427
00:17:25,233 --> 00:17:26,903
<i>It was easy for me to...</i>

428
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,800
<i>you know, let my mom go out
on this date with him.</i>

429
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,770
[Charlene] <i>I feel good
for him too,</i>

430
00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:34,897
that he's finally getting
to see me possibly make
a connection.

431
00:17:35,767 --> 00:17:37,497
Oh, look, and here's
my date now.

432
00:17:38,633 --> 00:17:40,703
- You look nice.
- [Gabriel] You look
so beautiful.

433
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,930
- [Charlene] Thank you.
- Aw!

434
00:17:41,933 --> 00:17:44,733
[Jimmy] <i>I'm excited to spend
one-on-one time with Charlene.</i>

435
00:17:44,733 --> 00:17:46,073
I think Charlene's
a great pick.

436
00:17:46,067 --> 00:17:47,427
I think she's a great person.

437
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:49,073
[Soyoung] <i>I know Jimmy's
going to take care,</i>

438
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:50,627
<i>anybody that he dates.</i>

439
00:17:57,167 --> 00:17:58,767
[Charlene] Oh!

440
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,070
Look at this.

441
00:18:01,067 --> 00:18:03,067
<i>We have hors d'oeuvres.</i>

442
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:06,173
Yeah, you look beautiful.

443
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:08,797
- So happy to be here with you.
- Thank you. Me, too.

444
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,970
- Well, cheers.
- Cheers.

445
00:18:10,067 --> 00:18:11,967
To a beautiful night
with a beautiful person.

446
00:18:12,067 --> 00:18:12,867
- Same.
- Yeah.

447
00:18:12,867 --> 00:18:14,127
<i>- Salut.
- Salut.</i>

448
00:18:15,367 --> 00:18:16,327
You want to know why

449
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:18,173
I thought I wanted to take
you out on a date?

450
00:18:18,167 --> 00:18:19,597
- Why?
- Because...

451
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,600
I think you're so interesting
and have so much to say.

452
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,070
- You are so passionate about
everything you talk about.
- Wow.

453
00:18:26,067 --> 00:18:28,867
He's saying
such really empowering,

454
00:18:28,867 --> 00:18:30,427
beautiful things to me.

455
00:18:30,433 --> 00:18:32,673
<i>I'm allowing him to know</i>

456
00:18:32,667 --> 00:18:34,827
that I'm feeling him
in that moment.

457
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,473
I would ask, like,
from your example,

458
00:18:36,467 --> 00:18:39,367
like, what turned you
on about women?

459
00:18:39,367 --> 00:18:42,127
Um, let's see. What turns
me on the most...

460
00:18:42,133 --> 00:18:43,303
I would say...

461
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,070
is when...

462
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,070
[Jimmy] <i>I'm going to be real.
I'm a little nervous</i>

463
00:18:48,067 --> 00:18:51,367
<i>because Charlene's a little
bit, you know, aggressive.</i>

464
00:18:51,367 --> 00:18:52,767
<i>Out of all the women
in my life,</i>

465
00:18:52,767 --> 00:18:55,067
I've quite never met
a woman like Charlene.

466
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:56,427
When you kiss someone,

467
00:18:56,433 --> 00:18:59,873
you can totally tell
if you have a connection.

468
00:18:59,867 --> 00:19:02,767
You know, this is a perfect
opportunity for us.

469
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:03,867
- You know, for me--
- It really is.

470
00:19:03,867 --> 00:19:05,927
Worth. Yeah, this is great.

471
00:19:05,933 --> 00:19:08,073
This is great.
I appreciate you so much.

472
00:19:08,433 --> 00:19:09,503
I know.

473
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,200
[Jimmy] <i>I think that she's...</i>

474
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,400
She just does it
on a different level.

475
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,670
She just will grab you

476
00:19:14,667 --> 00:19:18,067
and just tell you exactly,
in your face, what she wants.

477
00:19:18,067 --> 00:19:20,567
It's just, I've never
experienced something
like this.

478
00:19:20,567 --> 00:19:22,167
Maybe like, after we eat,

479
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:24,697
we could do something
to really relax.

480
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:28,200
I think, like,
I'd like to, you know,

481
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,330
talk more. Like, I was
sitting here thinking like,

482
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,203
we should move this table.

483
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,070
- And you should
serve me some of these--
- Just need to fold one side.

484
00:19:35,067 --> 00:19:37,197
Right, but, um,

485
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,670
- yeah.
- Yeah.

486
00:19:38,667 --> 00:19:42,197
[Timmy] <i>Charlene's sexual
tension energy is just
through the roof.</i>

487
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,170
<i>She's a woman that's
very passionate about
what she wants.</i>

488
00:19:45,167 --> 00:19:48,067
But it kind of makes
me want to run away.

489
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,270
For me, kissing is...

490
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,070
just as wild to me.

491
00:19:56,067 --> 00:19:58,227
Like, sometimes, I'll have sex
and not kiss the person.

492
00:19:58,233 --> 00:20:00,533
- Yeah, swear to God.
- Um, wow.

493
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,330
[Charlene] <i>I feel like,
with Jimmy,</i>

494
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:07,103
the lines of energy are off.

495
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,600
<i>You know? There's
no alignment there.</i>

496
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,770
And I just feel like
I'm shooting missiles
in the wind.

497
00:20:15,267 --> 00:20:17,667
I could have probably
learned a little bit more
about Charlene

498
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:20,167
but I'm just really,
not really feeling it

499
00:20:20,167 --> 00:20:21,597
as much as I thought I might.

500
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,800
<i>So, I'm just going back
to the drawing board.</i>

501
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,230
I told Jose that
I really liked you.

502
00:20:28,233 --> 00:20:29,433
That means a lot.

503
00:20:29,433 --> 00:20:31,773
[Pola] <i>I'm really starting
to have feelings for Ryan.</i>

504
00:20:31,767 --> 00:20:34,167
I can feel his energy
through my skin.

505
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:35,267
[Joey] So, it says,

506
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:36,697
Kelle and Billy,

507
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,830
you are going glamping
on a secluded beach.

508
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,773
[all cheering]

509
00:20:41,767 --> 00:20:43,227
Keep your hands to yourself.

510
00:20:43,233 --> 00:20:45,933
[Jose] <i>Kelle's not going
to have the same fun
as if I were there.</i>

511
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:47,373
Hmm, I don't know.

512
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,830
[Kelle] <i>I'm so excited.</i>

513
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,073
I really can get
down and dirty.

514
00:20:53,067 --> 00:20:54,527
Yeah!

515
00:20:58,733 --> 00:21:00,273
[conversations overlapping]

516
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,270
[Joey] Would you like to go

517
00:21:03,267 --> 00:21:06,097
on a little something,
something down by the water?

518
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,100
[April] Uh-huh. A little date.

519
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,070
Possibly, we could say--

520
00:21:10,067 --> 00:21:11,467
I'm flattered.

521
00:21:11,467 --> 00:21:13,067
- Let's go now.
- Okay.

522
00:21:13,067 --> 00:21:15,827
It's a beautiful day
with a beautiful woman.

523
00:21:16,267 --> 00:21:17,827
Thank you, Joey.

524
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:21,233
[Joey] <i>Since day one,
me and April just have
that chemistry and bond.</i>

525
00:21:21,233 --> 00:21:23,433
<i>And I decided it would
be a good idea</i>

526
00:21:23,433 --> 00:21:25,503
<i>get even more closer
with April.</i>

527
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,170
Nothing can get any better.

528
00:21:27,167 --> 00:21:28,627
The lower arms.

529
00:21:28,633 --> 00:21:29,933
[April] And right
here too, babe.

530
00:21:29,933 --> 00:21:30,803
Right here.

531
00:21:31,767 --> 00:21:34,327
[Joey] A little massage
along with it.

532
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:36,533
Uh, love it. Yes.

533
00:21:37,133 --> 00:21:38,333
Very nice.

534
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:41,273
[Ryan] Wow, your skin
is beautiful, April.

535
00:21:41,267 --> 00:21:42,567
- Thank you.
- Beautiful.

536
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:43,797
[April] <i>Joey is growing on me.</i>

537
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,430
Because I'm very
silly by nature.

538
00:21:46,433 --> 00:21:49,333
I'm like a little kid
who just likes to have fun.

539
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:50,703
And he makes me laugh.

540
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:54,903
[April] So, how does it feel
to date an older woman?

541
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,070
It feels, honestly,

542
00:21:57,067 --> 00:21:58,927
it's a completely
new experience

543
00:21:58,933 --> 00:22:00,873
but I'm really digging it.

544
00:22:00,867 --> 00:22:02,297
I'm really digging it.

545
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,500
And I wouldn't ask
for any other woman,

546
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,600
other than you,

547
00:22:07,267 --> 00:22:08,827
to be on a date with.

548
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:10,073
Am I blushing?

549
00:22:10,067 --> 00:22:11,367
[laughs]

550
00:22:11,367 --> 00:22:14,227
You know, I first met you,

551
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:16,673
and the way you talked
and your mannerisms

552
00:22:16,667 --> 00:22:18,827
and everything
are very unique.

553
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:21,573
You just like, surprise me,
and I was like...

554
00:22:21,567 --> 00:22:24,767
Now, I'm blushing. Oh, my God!

555
00:22:25,933 --> 00:22:28,733
You can't be hitting
me like that, April.

556
00:22:28,733 --> 00:22:30,573
[April] <i>It's kind of hard
to believe that</i>

557
00:22:30,567 --> 00:22:32,567
<i>out of all the young
men in the house,</i>

558
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,070
I am sort of gravitating

559
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,830
to the youngest guy.

560
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,530
But...

561
00:22:38,533 --> 00:22:41,373
<i>...there was so much
more to Joey</i>

562
00:22:41,367 --> 00:22:43,327
<i>than what meets the eye.</i>

563
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:46,073
He's got a real calmness
in his soul.

564
00:22:46,067 --> 00:22:48,227
And it's kind of what
I need right now.

565
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:49,633
I'm just...

566
00:22:49,633 --> 00:22:53,303
starting to remove
sort of those, you know,

567
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:56,070
those barriers
and those like, limits.

568
00:22:56,067 --> 00:22:59,627
Where, "April,
you're this age.

569
00:22:59,633 --> 00:23:02,973
You should be looking
at people like max,

570
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,930
ten years younger,

571
00:23:04,933 --> 00:23:07,803
and maybe a little bit older
because I'm very young.

572
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,070
- even though--
- Well, yeah.

573
00:23:10,067 --> 00:23:12,427
You're like 25-years-old,
aren't you?

574
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:13,973
- [Joey laughs]
- See?

575
00:23:14,067 --> 00:23:16,197
[April] I'll keep him around.

576
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,070
- No, so--
- I'll be around
for the rest of your life.

577
00:23:19,067 --> 00:23:20,267
[Joey] Don't you worry.

578
00:23:20,267 --> 00:23:22,567
The rest of your life.

579
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,267
Aw, I promise
I'll always stay...

580
00:23:26,667 --> 00:23:28,467
...sexy, like your mom.

581
00:23:28,467 --> 00:23:30,567
[Joey] <i>What gets me
going about April is,</i>

582
00:23:30,567 --> 00:23:32,767
how great of a listener
she is.

583
00:23:32,767 --> 00:23:37,227
<i>And how open she is to
everything that I have to say.</i>

584
00:23:37,233 --> 00:23:38,533
<i>Even though I'm young,</i>

585
00:23:38,533 --> 00:23:41,533
she says that I have
more of an old soul.

586
00:23:41,533 --> 00:23:44,073
<i>Like, that really made me
happy when she said that.</i>

587
00:23:44,067 --> 00:23:46,227
She knows me the best,
out of everyone.

588
00:23:46,233 --> 00:23:48,273
<i>I just think April
would be my girl.</i>

589
00:23:49,267 --> 00:23:50,397
Watch out, watch out,
watch out, watch out.

590
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,470
There's a spider,
spider, spider [bleep]

591
00:23:52,467 --> 00:23:53,867
I hate spiders.

592
00:23:53,867 --> 00:23:55,067
Yes, yes, yes, there.

593
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:57,133
Just shake it off.

594
00:23:57,133 --> 00:24:00,073
[screams] Don't leave
my side, April, please.

595
00:24:00,067 --> 00:24:01,497
- No, please.
- [April] We're going.

596
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:09,873
[Ryan] <i>Pola's a special lady.</i>

597
00:24:09,867 --> 00:24:11,627
<i>She's top of the line.</i>

598
00:24:11,633 --> 00:24:13,933
I think a special woman
deserves a special date.

599
00:24:13,933 --> 00:24:16,303
So, that's exactly what
I'm making happen

600
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,930
<i>for Pola tonight.</i>

601
00:24:17,933 --> 00:24:20,203
After the drama with Stef,

602
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,170
<i>Pola looks like she's
opening the door</i>

603
00:24:23,167 --> 00:24:25,127
up again for maybe
there to be an "Us."

604
00:24:25,733 --> 00:24:26,833
I hope so.

605
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:29,333
<i>I'm coming through,
step into the batter's box,</i>

606
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:30,733
because I'm going to knock
it out of the park.

607
00:24:32,667 --> 00:24:34,767
- [Ryan] Wow.
- Wow.

608
00:24:34,767 --> 00:24:36,067
[Ryan] Look at you.

609
00:24:36,067 --> 00:24:38,497
You look amazing, wow.

610
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:40,773
I love that.

611
00:24:40,767 --> 00:24:41,897
I picked this for you.

612
00:24:43,167 --> 00:24:45,927
I'm really happy that Ryan
asked me out.

613
00:24:45,933 --> 00:24:49,503
<i>I was thinking about
Ryan T all the time.</i>

614
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,530
<i>I feel really, really
attracted to him.</i>

615
00:24:51,533 --> 00:24:54,133
<i>He makes me feel really
secure about myself.</i>

616
00:24:54,133 --> 00:24:56,873
<i>But the new Ryan,
I really like him.</i>

617
00:24:56,867 --> 00:24:59,197
<i>And I like to be around him.</i>

618
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,270
So, I feel a little
bit conflicted.

619
00:25:01,267 --> 00:25:03,367
<i>I'm going to go out
with Ryan again,</i>

620
00:25:03,367 --> 00:25:05,197
<i>and see how I feel about him.</i>

621
00:25:10,067 --> 00:25:11,597
<i>I'm so excited.</i>

622
00:25:13,733 --> 00:25:15,073
You got the good view, eh?

623
00:25:15,067 --> 00:25:16,697
[laughs] I do.

624
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:18,227
No, but you, too.

625
00:25:18,233 --> 00:25:19,203
Well, no.

626
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,400
- No?
- No.

627
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,570
You got me.
Now, clear my view.

628
00:25:22,567 --> 00:25:24,597
The best view in the house.
The best view.

629
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,230
[Ryan] <i>Pola is
incredibly attractive.</i>

630
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,573
<i>But aside from that,</i>

631
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:30,327
I can feel the positiveness
in her spirit.

632
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:34,103
Pola's very good at keeping
me actively engaged.

633
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,330
<i>And that's dope to me.</i>

634
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,733
That's the law of attraction.

635
00:25:36,733 --> 00:25:38,503
I always have a lot
of fun with you.

636
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,770
I actually, I do.

637
00:25:39,767 --> 00:25:41,067
- [Ryan] I always have
a good time with you.
- I do, I do.

638
00:25:41,067 --> 00:25:43,267
[Pola] I told Jose
that I really liked you.

639
00:25:43,967 --> 00:25:46,067
But when I met your mom,

640
00:25:46,067 --> 00:25:47,397
I liked you even more.

641
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,230
- That means a lot.
- No, but it's the truth.

642
00:25:49,233 --> 00:25:52,773
It's really important
to see who raised you.

643
00:25:52,767 --> 00:25:53,927
- Where you come from.
- [Pola] Yeah.

644
00:25:53,933 --> 00:25:55,973
You need to know your roots.
That's true.

645
00:25:56,967 --> 00:25:59,267
Now, tell me about
your last relationship.

646
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:01,297
Very. very passionate.

647
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,330
- [Pola] Really?
- Yeah.

648
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:05,803
So, I'm a passionate
person myself.

649
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,600
So, I always tend to attract
people that are very,
very passionate.

650
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,970
I think that's why
we're together.

651
00:26:10,633 --> 00:26:12,233
- Right?
- Lot of passion.

652
00:26:12,233 --> 00:26:13,233
- [Pola] Yeah.
- A lot of passion.

653
00:26:13,233 --> 00:26:14,673
- So, I like--
- I can see that.

654
00:26:14,667 --> 00:26:16,897
Because every time
I'm close to you,

655
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,500
- Okay.
- you're looking at me.

656
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,630
And if I turn myself
and just watch you,

657
00:26:21,633 --> 00:26:23,633
you will like,
you just turn away.

658
00:26:23,633 --> 00:26:26,433
But that's something
spicy, right?

659
00:26:26,433 --> 00:26:28,133
Yeah, I'm passionate, too.

660
00:26:28,133 --> 00:26:30,233
So, I dated this guy.

661
00:26:30,233 --> 00:26:31,973
He wanted to see me everyday.

662
00:26:32,067 --> 00:26:34,327
- Right.
- And for me, it wasn't easy

663
00:26:34,333 --> 00:26:36,473
because I was working,
I was with my family.

664
00:26:36,467 --> 00:26:37,567
- Right.
- [Pola] He...

665
00:26:37,567 --> 00:26:41,097
started to ask so much
time from me.

666
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,070
- Too demanding.
- [Pola] Yeah, too demanding.

667
00:26:43,067 --> 00:26:44,067
You don't need
to complicate it.

668
00:26:44,067 --> 00:26:46,097
- It gets complicated
by itself.
- Right.

669
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,670
- So, just--
- Ain't that the truth?

670
00:26:47,667 --> 00:26:48,627
That's the truth.

671
00:26:48,633 --> 00:26:50,733
I'm seeing a lot
of progress being made.

672
00:26:50,733 --> 00:26:53,103
<i>I think Pola's feeling
a lot more comfortable,</i>

673
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,300
<i>opening up to me.</i>

674
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,670
<i>For the first time, she's gone</i>

675
00:26:55,667 --> 00:26:58,467
into her past relationships
with me.

676
00:26:58,467 --> 00:27:00,367
<i>And kind of, sort of
opened her life up a bit.</i>

677
00:27:00,367 --> 00:27:04,867
So, I think we are in a very
good place right now.

678
00:27:04,867 --> 00:27:08,067
I think our bond and our
connection has deepened.

679
00:27:08,067 --> 00:27:10,327
[Pola] Can you read
what it says there?

680
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:12,803
[Ryan] <i>Vive... el...</i>

681
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,700
- [Pola] <i>sueno.</i>
- [Ryan] ...sonyo.

682
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,730
[Pola] That means,
you should live your dreams.

683
00:27:17,733 --> 00:27:19,533
[Pola] <i>The restaurant
is beautiful.</i>

684
00:27:19,533 --> 00:27:22,233
The sunset is amazing.

685
00:27:22,233 --> 00:27:25,073
And just me being
by Ryan's side,

686
00:27:25,567 --> 00:27:26,827
<i>feels really good.</i>

687
00:27:26,833 --> 00:27:28,973
When I'm around anybody else,

688
00:27:29,067 --> 00:27:31,497
I have to think about
what I need to say.

689
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:35,630
But with him, everything like,
just goes through with me.

690
00:27:35,633 --> 00:27:38,173
[Pola] I'm really happy
to be with you.

691
00:27:38,167 --> 00:27:40,097
I'm living my <i>sueno.</i>

692
00:27:41,767 --> 00:27:44,327
And tomorrow, if you look
at me and I look at you,

693
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:45,973
don't turn around, okay?

694
00:27:46,067 --> 00:27:47,497
[both laughing]

695
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,200
- [Pola] <i>Salut.
- Salut.</i>

696
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,870
To another exciting
day tomorrow.

697
00:27:51,867 --> 00:27:53,197
I'm excited.

698
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,530
- To an incredible second
date with you.
- [Pola] Yes.

699
00:27:56,533 --> 00:27:59,503
[Pola] <i>I'm really starting
to have feelings for Ryan.</i>

700
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,970
I can feel his energy
through my skin.

701
00:28:02,067 --> 00:28:04,897
<i>I haven't felt this way
for a long time.</i>

702
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,600
[Pola] I'm really happy that
I'm sharing this with you.

703
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,070
And I believe, since day one,

704
00:28:09,067 --> 00:28:10,867
I saw you, I said,
"This is the guy."

705
00:28:10,867 --> 00:28:12,597
<i>- Salut</i> to life.
<i>- Salut</i> to life.

706
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,400
- [Pola] Life. Yes.
- And the adventure.

707
00:28:19,433 --> 00:28:23,473
I think Billy
and your mom's going
to go for it.

708
00:28:27,733 --> 00:28:29,973
Billy will be like,
uh, huh, huh, oh.

709
00:28:37,833 --> 00:28:40,273
[overlapping conversations]

710
00:28:40,267 --> 00:28:41,467
[phone vibrating]

711
00:28:41,467 --> 00:28:42,667
I got a text!

712
00:28:42,667 --> 00:28:44,067
Bring it in! Bring it in!

713
00:28:44,067 --> 00:28:45,197
Come here, come here.

714
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,633
[Joey] So, it says,

715
00:28:48,433 --> 00:28:49,473
"Hi, everyone.

716
00:28:49,467 --> 00:28:52,067
For some of you,
it's time to get away

717
00:28:52,067 --> 00:28:53,967
and sleep under the stars.

718
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:55,397
Kelle and Billy,

719
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,400
and Stefany and Gabriel,

720
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,800
you are going glamping
on a secluded beach."

721
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,330
[all cheering]

722
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:06,903
I am so glad that I get
to spend time with Gabriel.

723
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,730
And definitely,
out of the house.

724
00:29:08,733 --> 00:29:11,173
The only thing,
is that I'm worried

725
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:14,497
about Kelle and Billy
having an overnight.

726
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,570
[Kelle] <i>I'm so excited.</i>

727
00:29:17,567 --> 00:29:19,897
I feel I'm a little bit
glamorous, of course,

728
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,830
but I also can get
down and dirty.

729
00:29:21,833 --> 00:29:23,973
<i>Kind of like,
Sex on the Beach.</i>

730
00:29:24,067 --> 00:29:26,367
Hey Billy, you better
watch it on the beach.

731
00:29:26,367 --> 00:29:28,367
Keep your hands to yourself.

732
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:29,667
For sure, always.

733
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:30,867
[Jose] <i>Glamping is super cool.</i>

734
00:29:30,867 --> 00:29:32,667
And I'm sure they're going
to have a lot of fun.

735
00:29:32,667 --> 00:29:35,867
<i>But Kelle's not going
to have the same fun
as if I were there.</i>

736
00:29:35,867 --> 00:29:37,067
Hmm, I don't know.

737
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,470
Yay!

738
00:29:40,467 --> 00:29:43,097
"For the rest of you,
the villa's your playground."

739
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,830
- My home.
- Right on.

740
00:29:52,733 --> 00:29:55,073
[Kelle] What is this?

741
00:29:56,567 --> 00:29:58,297
I'm so excited.

742
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,000
- [Billy] Yeah.
- This is so nice.

743
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:04,133
[Kelle] <i>The tent that
we're about to stay in,</i>

744
00:30:04,133 --> 00:30:06,833
is so magical, so beautiful.

745
00:30:06,833 --> 00:30:11,203
<i>But I don't know if Billy's
mom will let us share a bed.</i>

746
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,730
[Gabriel] Should we open
some champagne?

747
00:30:12,733 --> 00:30:13,773
No, I'm okay.

748
00:30:15,033 --> 00:30:17,003
[women squealing]

749
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,030
- Wow!
- Oh!

750
00:30:21,033 --> 00:30:22,333
Crazy!

751
00:30:22,333 --> 00:30:23,903
[Gabriel] <i>This is a much
needed break.</i>

752
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,700
<i>Especially, after all
the fights with Ryan.</i>

753
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,130
I'm here to not think
about the villa.

754
00:30:28,133 --> 00:30:30,633
So, I'm just going
to decompress

755
00:30:30,633 --> 00:30:33,033
<i>and have a great time
with Stefany.</i>

756
00:30:33,033 --> 00:30:36,503
This has potential
to go past the sky.

757
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,070
And I'm hyped about it.

758
00:30:38,067 --> 00:30:39,627
[Stefany] You got it
all over him.

759
00:30:39,633 --> 00:30:41,533
- [Kelle] Wait, down there--
- [Stefany] Wait, is there--

760
00:30:41,533 --> 00:30:43,503
- [Gabriel] He's soaked.
- [Stefany] He's soaked.

761
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,170
[Gabriel laughing]

762
00:30:45,167 --> 00:30:47,497
[Kelle] I'm sorry, Billy.
Is he making you mad?

763
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:53,373
Oh, my goodness.
I can't watch.

764
00:30:53,367 --> 00:30:54,397
[Gabriel] He's like, "Harder."

765
00:30:57,733 --> 00:30:59,703
[Billy] <i>Kelle doesn't
really mind PDA.</i>

766
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,430
<i>But with my mom being around,
it's a little weird.</i>

767
00:31:02,433 --> 00:31:05,703
Yeah, I definitely, am not
enjoying this one bit.

768
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,770
I think she could tone
it down a little bit.

769
00:31:08,767 --> 00:31:11,427
You know, or I'm going
to have to maybe intervene.

770
00:31:11,433 --> 00:31:13,433
I don't know, I'm not sure.
Maybe I won't.

771
00:31:13,433 --> 00:31:15,233
I'll just let him
figure it out.

772
00:31:15,233 --> 00:31:17,573
Maybe you could just
tell her to tone it down.

773
00:31:18,967 --> 00:31:21,067
Can I tell your mom
what you were like,

774
00:31:21,967 --> 00:31:23,267
going to do the other night?

775
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,570
No, really, should I tell her?

776
00:31:26,567 --> 00:31:27,797
[Stefany] No, don't tell me.

777
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,470
- I don't want to hear it.
- [Billy] I plead the fifth.

778
00:31:29,467 --> 00:31:31,067
[Kelle] Plead the fifth?

779
00:31:31,067 --> 00:31:33,397
[Kelle] <i>I think Billy
is more concerned about</i>

780
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,530
what his mom thinks.

781
00:31:35,533 --> 00:31:38,303
<i>But I'm still going
to enjoy the moment,</i>

782
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,630
<i>and the experience.</i>

783
00:31:39,633 --> 00:31:41,673
I'm not letting
anyone stop me.

784
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,630
Didn't you guys need a little
alone time and stuff?

785
00:31:45,633 --> 00:31:47,273
Just to get out of the villa--

786
00:31:47,267 --> 00:31:48,797
[Kelle] Well, we're trying
to get away from her

787
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,300
but she just keeps following
us everywhere we go.

788
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,270
[Stefany laughs]

789
00:31:57,967 --> 00:31:59,727
[both chuckle]

790
00:32:01,133 --> 00:32:02,203
- [Kelle] You want to go?
- [Billy] Sure.

791
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,230
[Gabriel] Bye, guys.

792
00:32:05,533 --> 00:32:07,203
[Stefany] <i>Kelle's had
a few drinks.</i>

793
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,070
She's, you know,
a little wild one.

794
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:17,497
[both laughing]

795
00:32:24,967 --> 00:32:27,097
[Joey] <i>So, with glamping,</i>

796
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,500
what do you think about
Gabriel and Stefany?

797
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,270
Do you think they'll be going
at it or what do you think?

798
00:32:32,267 --> 00:32:33,867
I think Gabriel's a gentleman,

799
00:32:33,867 --> 00:32:36,597
and he's going to really
try to just talk and build on,

800
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,200
- they have that
natural chemistry.
- I think so, too.

801
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,200
Like you said,
there's this chemistry.

802
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,630
We've all seen it.

803
00:32:42,633 --> 00:32:44,673
And at one point, you have
to kind of, figure out

804
00:32:44,667 --> 00:32:48,067
you know, is it on a sexual,
romantic level.

805
00:32:48,067 --> 00:32:49,627
- Right.
- [Lisa] And this is
the perfect opportunity

806
00:32:49,633 --> 00:32:51,173
for them to find out.

807
00:32:51,167 --> 00:32:52,697
[Lisa] <i>Gabriel and Stefany,</i>

808
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,930
they already have
this connection.

809
00:32:54,933 --> 00:32:57,973
You know? And Stefany
and I would talk and whatnot,

810
00:32:58,067 --> 00:32:59,297
and she's like,
"No, we're friends.

811
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,070
We're totally just friends."

812
00:33:01,067 --> 00:33:03,067
And I was like,
"That's how it all begins.

813
00:33:03,067 --> 00:33:05,167
Just friendship. Right?"

814
00:33:05,167 --> 00:33:06,527
[Soyoung] Okay, so I think,

815
00:33:06,533 --> 00:33:09,633
Billy and your mom's
going to go for it.

816
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,870
Exactly what I was thinking.

817
00:33:12,867 --> 00:33:14,067
That's exactly what
I was thinking.

818
00:33:14,067 --> 00:33:15,897
If he doesn't want
to make the move,

819
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,570
then she'll make
the move for him.

820
00:33:18,567 --> 00:33:20,967
And if he doesn't
enjoy it, which,

821
00:33:22,067 --> 00:33:23,197
that's not a possibility,

822
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,500
I already know
he's going to be enjoying it.

823
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,100
[all laughing]

824
00:33:28,533 --> 00:33:30,233
[Kelle] I said,
take it off, Billy!

825
00:33:44,067 --> 00:33:45,897
[Gabriel] So, now
that we're alone,

826
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,430
I did want to talk to you
about something.

827
00:33:48,433 --> 00:33:51,203
You know, maybe if it was
any other situation,

828
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,600
I was dating and stuff,

829
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,070
I would have jumped
in and like,

830
00:33:54,067 --> 00:33:56,767
started making out with you
and stuff like that.

831
00:33:56,767 --> 00:33:58,597
And I just want you
to know that,

832
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:02,100
I genuinely love
getting to know you.

833
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:05,070
And I want you to know
that I really have a lot
of respect for you.

834
00:34:05,067 --> 00:34:06,797
And you know, I'm just excited

835
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,500
to continue getting
to know you.

836
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,070
Oh.

837
00:34:10,067 --> 00:34:12,097
[Gabriel] <i>I've never really
had a serious relationship.</i>

838
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,830
<i>Usually, I'm very fast.</i>

839
00:34:13,833 --> 00:34:15,773
But I really am just
trying to learn

840
00:34:15,767 --> 00:34:18,167
and take things slow
for once in my life.

841
00:34:18,167 --> 00:34:19,467
Thank you, Gabriel.

842
00:34:20,633 --> 00:34:22,833
[laughs] You're so awesome.

843
00:34:22,833 --> 00:34:26,473
I love the fact that Gabriel
respects my boundaries.

844
00:34:26,467 --> 00:34:28,927
<i>It just makes me
more attracted to him.</i>

845
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:31,133
I think after what
I've been through

846
00:34:31,133 --> 00:34:33,833
with Ryan, with just one kiss,

847
00:34:33,833 --> 00:34:36,603
I don't want to ruin
what I have with Gabriel

848
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,500
and I definitely want
to take it really slow.

849
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,670
- We're out.
- We're out.

850
00:34:40,667 --> 00:34:41,827
All right, let's go.

851
00:34:41,833 --> 00:34:43,303
Help me up, little princess.

852
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,670
My little goth princess.

853
00:34:44,667 --> 00:34:45,927
[Stefany laughs] I know.

854
00:34:53,067 --> 00:34:54,227
[Billy] I don't think
I can stay here.

855
00:34:54,233 --> 00:34:57,073
I don't really like
the comforter of this bed.

856
00:34:57,067 --> 00:34:58,067
- [Kelle] Really?
- Yeah.

857
00:35:00,733 --> 00:35:01,873
[Kelle] I didn't even
think about that.

858
00:35:01,867 --> 00:35:04,227
I'm thinking about
like, the vibes.

859
00:35:04,233 --> 00:35:05,773
- Not the comforter.
- [Billy] Huh?

860
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,670
[Billy] <i>She definitely knows
what she wants.</i>

861
00:35:11,667 --> 00:35:14,627
But I just found
it a little bit weird

862
00:35:14,633 --> 00:35:18,273
to fall asleep next to someone
that was that sauced.

863
00:35:30,333 --> 00:35:31,173
[Billy] Yeah.

864
00:35:33,267 --> 00:35:34,267
You're going to stay?

865
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:38,367
Listen, bro.
You like, say one thing

866
00:35:38,367 --> 00:35:40,397
and then, your actions
say something else.

867
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,070
<i>I just don't have time
to play games.</i>

868
00:35:43,067 --> 00:35:44,897
But if you want to go
sleep with your mom,

869
00:35:45,733 --> 00:35:46,573
enjoy.

870
00:35:55,667 --> 00:35:57,497
I have a plan for tonight.

871
00:35:58,267 --> 00:35:59,827
But we will have to sneak out.

872
00:35:59,833 --> 00:36:01,803
I wanted to make her feel

873
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,270
<i>how a real man should
take care of a woman.</i>

874
00:36:04,267 --> 00:36:05,867
We're in this
mission impossible

875
00:36:05,867 --> 00:36:07,867
to sneak out of the villa.

876
00:36:07,867 --> 00:36:09,867
Tonight, I'm going to show him

877
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:11,427
that I'm the one
he should be with.

878
00:36:20,267 --> 00:36:21,967
[Kelle] <i>Billy walked out
on me last night.</i>

879
00:36:22,067 --> 00:36:23,827
And I was so annoyed,

880
00:36:23,833 --> 00:36:25,233
<i>I couldn't even go to sleep.</i>

881
00:36:25,233 --> 00:36:27,133
<i>Immediately went back
to the villa.</i>

882
00:36:27,133 --> 00:36:28,133
And...

883
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,470
...that's kind of how
that went down.

884
00:36:32,467 --> 00:36:34,667
- [knocking at door]
- Oh, someone's at the door.

885
00:36:34,667 --> 00:36:35,697
Don't worry, I'm up.

886
00:36:36,533 --> 00:36:38,173
- [Joey] Hello?
- How are you all?

887
00:36:38,767 --> 00:36:39,967
What's up, guys?

888
00:36:40,067 --> 00:36:41,127
[Joey] Hey.

889
00:36:41,133 --> 00:36:42,603
Is your mom sleeping?

890
00:36:43,433 --> 00:36:45,173
Would it matter if I was?

891
00:36:45,167 --> 00:36:46,827
- [Billy laughs]
- Because you'd wake me up.

892
00:36:46,833 --> 00:36:48,333
[Joey] I'll leave you guys.

893
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:50,933
[Joey] <i>Billy really messed up
with my mom because...</i>

894
00:36:52,167 --> 00:36:54,627
...my mom is a very
direct person.

895
00:36:54,633 --> 00:36:56,673
And if you're not going
to tell her straight up,

896
00:36:56,667 --> 00:36:58,727
then she's going
to blow a fuse.

897
00:36:58,733 --> 00:37:01,333
[Billy] I just feel like,
moving forward,

898
00:37:01,333 --> 00:37:02,803
I think I...

899
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,230
think we should just like,
slow things down a little bit.

900
00:37:06,233 --> 00:37:08,503
I don't know how much
slower you can be,

901
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,970
when someone's sleeping.

902
00:37:10,067 --> 00:37:12,567
Nothing was progressing
and you know that.

903
00:37:12,567 --> 00:37:15,827
I'm used to dating or hanging
out with super direct men,

904
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:17,233
that know what they want.

905
00:37:17,233 --> 00:37:20,533
They think it's a privilege
to spend time with me.

906
00:37:20,533 --> 00:37:22,073
And I feel like
you're missing that.

907
00:37:23,567 --> 00:37:25,297
[Billy] <i>Leading up to
the glamping experience,</i>

908
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:28,700
my feelings with Kelle
have been genuine.

909
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,200
<i>I believe that we were
making a great connection.</i>

910
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,870
Me leaving the glamping site
has kind of ruined that.

911
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,700
I do regret, kind of,

912
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,270
how it all went down.

913
00:37:39,533 --> 00:37:40,373
Okay.

914
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,830
Well,

915
00:37:41,833 --> 00:37:43,273
have a good morning.

916
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,970
- Okay.
- I'll talk to you later.

917
00:37:46,067 --> 00:37:47,497
- Good bye hug.
- [Kelle] Bye, boo.

918
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,730
He's going to get
so much space,

919
00:37:49,733 --> 00:37:52,073
he's not even going to know
that we're in the same house.

920
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,400
- Will you get Joey?
- Yeah.

921
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,070
I may have [bleep] up.

922
00:37:58,933 --> 00:38:01,773
[upbeat music playing]

923
00:38:02,967 --> 00:38:04,697
- [Jose] Hi!
- Yo, what's up?

924
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,200
- How are you, Ms. Glamping?
- Starving.

925
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,600
I see you, I get you.

926
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,130
[Kelle] Oh, I love that.

927
00:38:12,067 --> 00:38:13,067
Oh, thank you.

928
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,930
Girl, good morning.

929
00:38:14,933 --> 00:38:18,433
Hey, sorry guys.
No glam today.

930
00:38:18,433 --> 00:38:19,473
You're always glamorous.

931
00:38:19,467 --> 00:38:21,127
[Ryan] You look glam everyday.

932
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:22,203
We like you natural.

933
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,270
Thank you, babe.

934
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:25,067
Where were you last night?
I didn't see you.

935
00:38:25,067 --> 00:38:27,067
Oh, I came home. Don't worry.

936
00:38:27,067 --> 00:38:29,227
[Pola] And Jose was with me.

937
00:38:29,233 --> 00:38:30,773
- Where were you?
- Jose should have
been with me.

938
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:31,727
He would have seen.

939
00:38:32,933 --> 00:38:34,873
I was worried.

940
00:38:34,867 --> 00:38:37,267
[Kelle] Billy walked out
on me last night. Douchebag.

941
00:38:37,267 --> 00:38:38,297
Would you have left?

942
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,770
Nah, no way.

943
00:38:39,767 --> 00:38:43,197
We were in agreement that
nothing's going to happen
and be respectful...

944
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,530
- Right, right, right.
- ...and just chat.

945
00:38:45,533 --> 00:38:47,933
Especially, you've been having

946
00:38:47,933 --> 00:38:50,733
that type of connection
and those vibes,

947
00:38:50,733 --> 00:38:52,373
that you can chat and stay
there, you know?

948
00:38:52,367 --> 00:38:53,427
Yeah.

949
00:38:53,433 --> 00:38:54,903
I came here to date
young guys.

950
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,470
I knew why I came here.

951
00:38:56,467 --> 00:38:58,427
Kelle, you get spicy
quick, don't you?

952
00:38:58,433 --> 00:38:59,473
[Kelle] Yeah, I can.

953
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:01,473
No, it's not spicy.

954
00:39:01,467 --> 00:39:03,767
She gets real. She's real.

955
00:39:03,767 --> 00:39:06,067
- [Jose] That's awesome.
- I'm just talking my realness.

956
00:39:06,067 --> 00:39:08,527
The thing about Kelle
is that I've seen her...

957
00:39:09,467 --> 00:39:10,767
Nice side?

958
00:39:10,767 --> 00:39:12,297
Nice side, but also,

959
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,700
a vulnerable side.

960
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:16,430
<i>And that's something that
I like about someone.</i>

961
00:39:16,433 --> 00:39:18,603
[Pola] <i>I don't feel Kelle
is right for Jose.</i>

962
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,330
- Move forward.
- I am.

963
00:39:21,533 --> 00:39:23,103
I am moving forward.

964
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,800
I have men that
literally meet me

965
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,600
and tell me they're in love
with me, from the beginning.

966
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,500
- For sure.
- [Ryan] Right.

967
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,130
And it's like,
you want to go slow?

968
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:30,073
Bye.

969
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:40,627
After I saw how
Kelle's date with Billy went,

970
00:39:40,633 --> 00:39:45,273
I wanted to make her feel how
a real man should take
care of a woman.

971
00:39:45,267 --> 00:39:47,067
She has no idea
what's about to happen.

972
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,630
[Kelle] Come in.

973
00:39:55,567 --> 00:39:56,667
- [Jose] Hi.
- [Kelle] Hi.

974
00:39:57,667 --> 00:39:59,127
- [Jose] Are you doing good?
- [Kelle] Yeah.

975
00:39:59,133 --> 00:40:00,303
Awesome.

976
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,370
I wanted to tell you,
well, ask you,

977
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:05,027
we haven't had enough
time to be alone

978
00:40:05,033 --> 00:40:08,703
and actually, properly,
have a conversation.

979
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,700
Have some alone time, so,

980
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,970
I was thinking and planning,
if you want,

981
00:40:13,967 --> 00:40:15,727
I have a plan for tonight.

982
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:18,167
But we would
have to sneak out.

983
00:40:18,167 --> 00:40:19,227
[laughs]

984
00:40:25,367 --> 00:40:26,727
- Yeah, I'm down.
- Yeah?

985
00:40:27,333 --> 00:40:29,033
Yeah. It'll be funny.

986
00:40:29,033 --> 00:40:30,633
I think it would be awesome.

987
00:40:31,367 --> 00:40:32,527
And not have,

988
00:40:32,533 --> 00:40:35,133
- either Joey or my mom
or anyone--
- [Kelle laughs]

989
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:36,703
[Kelle] <i>I'm super shocked.</i>

990
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,570
He's asking me if I want to go
sneak out with him tonight.

991
00:40:40,467 --> 00:40:41,497
So, I'm like,

992
00:40:42,033 --> 00:40:44,173
"Duh, of course I do."

993
00:40:44,167 --> 00:40:45,527
- Yeah, you down?
- Yeah.

994
00:40:45,533 --> 00:40:46,803
Okay, let's do it.

995
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,300
[Kelle] <i>Now that Billy's
out of the picture,</i>

996
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,030
<i>I am all about Jose.</i>

997
00:40:50,033 --> 00:40:51,503
Prince Charming's here.

998
00:40:55,733 --> 00:40:57,203
We're both nervous.

999
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,370
<i>We're both feeling
an adrenaline rush.</i>

1000
00:41:00,367 --> 00:41:03,567
We're in this mission
impossible to sneak
out of the villa.

1001
00:41:05,267 --> 00:41:06,397
[Joey] My mom's free.

1002
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,600
I mean, Soyoung's free.

1003
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,270
But your eyes really
light up though,

1004
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:11,727
when you talk about April.

1005
00:41:11,733 --> 00:41:13,773
- See? Look, right now.
- Yeah.

1006
00:41:13,767 --> 00:41:15,497
- [Shannan] Look at him.
- April's my girl.

1007
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:18,730
- [Joey] I love talking
to her all the time.
- [Shannan] See?

1008
00:41:18,733 --> 00:41:20,073
Hey! Yeah.

1009
00:41:20,067 --> 00:41:22,327
[all chatting]

1010
00:41:22,333 --> 00:41:24,573
[Kelle] <i>We're about
to leave the house.</i>

1011
00:41:24,567 --> 00:41:27,227
<i>And then, Shannan
looks straight at me.</i>

1012
00:41:28,133 --> 00:41:29,833
<i>And I try and dodge her.</i>

1013
00:41:29,833 --> 00:41:32,103
I'm like, "Seriously, dude?"

1014
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:35,170
<i>I know that Jose has been
dating a lot of women
in the house.</i>

1015
00:41:35,167 --> 00:41:36,427
<i>But tonight,</i>

1016
00:41:36,433 --> 00:41:39,173
I'm going to show him that
I'm the one he should be with.

1017
00:41:39,167 --> 00:41:40,467
[Shannan] Did you guys
see this?

1018
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,800
[Kelle] <i>I'm super nervous.</i>

1019
00:41:45,733 --> 00:41:47,173
<i>And I'm sure
the other women here</i>

1020
00:41:47,167 --> 00:41:49,367
are going to lose
their [bleep] man.

1021
00:41:55,467 --> 00:41:57,697
[Pola] <i>So, Jose
is not in my room.</i>

1022
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,200
<i>I have no idea why.</i>

1023
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,430
<i>He never does that.</i>

1024
00:42:00,433 --> 00:42:01,933
<i>I have no idea
what's going on.</i>

1025
00:42:04,267 --> 00:42:07,797
[Kelle] <i>Everything about Jose
is amazing. Everything.</i>

1026
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,970
The fact that Jose is really
stepping up right now
is huge for me.

1027
00:42:11,067 --> 00:42:12,727
Like, he's always been
my number one.

1028
00:42:12,733 --> 00:42:15,733
[Jose] When I've decided on
something, I just go for it.

1029
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:17,673
[Shannan] I saw him
sneak out with Kelle.

1030
00:42:17,667 --> 00:42:18,797
Are you serious?

1031
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,430
I have no words.

1032
00:42:20,433 --> 00:42:22,673
I am devastated.

1033
00:42:22,667 --> 00:42:25,567
I don't see him with her.

1034
00:42:25,567 --> 00:42:28,497
Tomorrow, it will be the time
to choose your match.

1035
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:31,670
If your choice is a mismatch,
you could go home.

1036
00:42:31,667 --> 00:42:33,667
[all exclaiming]

1037
00:42:33,667 --> 00:42:34,827
[Ryan] <i>That's a lot
of pressure,</i>

1038
00:42:34,833 --> 00:42:36,503
I think, on a lot of people
in the house.

1039
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,070
Ah!

1040
00:42:38,067 --> 00:42:39,197
That is a little bit scary.
