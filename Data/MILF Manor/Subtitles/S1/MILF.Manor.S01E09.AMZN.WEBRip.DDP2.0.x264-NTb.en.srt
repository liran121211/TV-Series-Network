00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:02,930
<i>Previously on</i> MILF <i>Manor,</i>

2
00:00:02,931 --> 00:00:06,001
The time has come to see
if you've found a match.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,590
If your choice is a mismatch,

4
00:00:08,586 --> 00:00:11,166
you will be leaving
the villa today.

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:12,480
Wow.

6
00:00:12,482 --> 00:00:13,722
We need to select,

7
00:00:13,724 --> 00:00:15,794
who we have the strongest
connection with.

8
00:00:15,793 --> 00:00:18,313
With the hopes that,
that person feels the same.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,720
Oh, boy.

10
00:00:20,724 --> 00:00:23,904
Congratulations, you and
Stephany chose each other.

11
00:00:24,103 --> 00:00:25,003
Yay!

12
00:00:26,896 --> 00:00:30,276
You and April chose
each other.

13
00:00:30,275 --> 00:00:33,095
I needed to make a decision
but it wasn't easy.

14
00:00:33,586 --> 00:00:34,616
Ryan, I chose you.

15
00:00:36,482 --> 00:00:39,932
The woman that I chose
is Kelle.

16
00:00:39,931 --> 00:00:42,381
[Pola] <i>I really cannot
believe Jose chose Kelle.</i>

17
00:00:42,379 --> 00:00:43,589
<i>And I'm not happy with that.</i>

18
00:00:43,586 --> 00:00:45,376
I don't see them together
outside The Villa.

19
00:00:46,103 --> 00:00:47,283
Down to us.

20
00:00:47,275 --> 00:00:49,685
Yeah, that's everyone.

21
00:00:49,689 --> 00:00:52,479
Let's see what your friends
and family have to say

22
00:00:52,482 --> 00:00:54,382
about your new relationship.

23
00:00:54,379 --> 00:00:55,479
Is this seat taken?

24
00:00:56,379 --> 00:00:57,759
[both screaming]

25
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:03,997
I think it's a very big deal
that Jose and my sister
get along.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Because if they don't--

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,170
If Mckenna doesn't like Jose,
he out.

28
00:01:07,931 --> 00:01:09,481
How far has your
intimacy gone?

29
00:01:12,586 --> 00:01:15,716
Mckenna is definitely
someone with a very strong personality.

30
00:01:15,724 --> 00:01:17,484
<i>So similar to Kelle and...</i>

31
00:01:17,482 --> 00:01:19,832
some of Mckenna's questions

32
00:01:19,827 --> 00:01:25,687
makes me question if Kelle is
a match for me or not.

33
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:26,689
[all laughing]

34
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:27,999
Emma!

35
00:01:29,379 --> 00:01:33,829
My only concern about
my daughter Emma, is not
liking Ryan.

36
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:35,309
She's not easy.

37
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:36,716
Do you want children?

38
00:01:37,413 --> 00:01:38,793
One day, I'd be open to it.

39
00:01:38,793 --> 00:01:40,903
Because my mother doesn't want
any more children.

40
00:01:41,827 --> 00:01:44,277
- Oh, my Lord!
- Come here, Baby doll.

41
00:01:44,275 --> 00:01:46,095
- What are you doing?
- How are you?

42
00:01:46,103 --> 00:01:48,073
It's so good to see you.

43
00:01:51,172 --> 00:01:52,282
Enough, come home.

44
00:01:52,275 --> 00:01:53,165
Oh, my God.

45
00:01:54,379 --> 00:01:55,519
Wow.

46
00:01:55,517 --> 00:01:56,787
- What's happening?
- I'm taking her.

47
00:01:56,793 --> 00:01:58,833
Is this guy actually serious?

48
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:01,207
Like, is this... Am I being
pranked right now?

49
00:02:05,275 --> 00:02:07,095
So, you're really cute.

50
00:02:07,103 --> 00:02:08,723
Thank you, thank you.

51
00:02:08,724 --> 00:02:10,104
- You are.
- You are too.

52
00:02:10,103 --> 00:02:13,933
How serious, you are with
your date?

53
00:02:13,931 --> 00:02:16,071
I'm a little hurt about what happened

54
00:02:16,068 --> 00:02:17,588
earlier today with April.

55
00:02:17,586 --> 00:02:21,996
<i>Emma showing up definitely
changes the game.</i>

56
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,790
And I'm starting to wonder if
April is the right one for me.

57
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,169
Will you be down to know me?

58
00:02:38,793 --> 00:02:39,793
[Emma] <i>All right,</i>

59
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:41,793
are we gonna play truth
or dare?

60
00:02:41,793 --> 00:02:43,793
[April] Your call.
You're our guest.

61
00:02:43,793 --> 00:02:47,103
[Jose] <i>Truth or dare is not
one of my favorite games because</i>

62
00:02:47,103 --> 00:02:53,793
you need to be open
to doing things that
you're not necessarily do.

63
00:02:53,793 --> 00:02:56,593
Having my sister and my mom

64
00:02:56,586 --> 00:03:01,276
and the woman I'm dating and
the guy that my mom is dating

65
00:03:01,275 --> 00:03:05,925
and Kelle's daughter and son and

66
00:03:05,931 --> 00:03:10,591
I don't know, this could get
out of control really quickly.
And I don't like that.

67
00:03:12,482 --> 00:03:13,482
Okay.

68
00:03:13,482 --> 00:03:15,002
- [Kelle] Emma.
- Oh, god.

69
00:03:16,172 --> 00:03:17,482
Truth or dare, darling?

70
00:03:18,896 --> 00:03:19,996
Truth.

71
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,280
Oh, you want truth?

72
00:03:21,275 --> 00:03:23,785
- Yeah sure.
- I love a good truth.

73
00:03:23,793 --> 00:03:28,793
- When you saw, Joey, truthfully,
- Mm-hmm

74
00:03:30,482 --> 00:03:32,212
what did you feel
when you saw him?

75
00:03:35,275 --> 00:03:36,615
You want the truth?

76
00:03:38,172 --> 00:03:41,282
Um, I love that Emma
has shown up.

77
00:03:41,275 --> 00:03:43,615
Because it's gonna put April
to the test.

78
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,930
Because she needs
to step it up or step out.

79
00:03:46,931 --> 00:03:52,621
Because to know how April's ex
treated him, like, maybe you
don't need to be around that.

80
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,000
So, I'm definitely looking out
for Joey.

81
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,830
You know, when you were, like,
everyone, like when they were young

82
00:04:01,103 --> 00:04:06,693
I'm saying, I'm saying, like,
when you were 10 years-old,
9 years-old, you know,

83
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:10,169
then you meet a boy or a girl,

84
00:04:10,172 --> 00:04:11,792
and you just feel, like, butterflies.

85
00:04:13,103 --> 00:04:14,033
It did happen.

86
00:04:16,275 --> 00:04:19,715
And it's cool to feel that,
you know.

87
00:04:19,724 --> 00:04:23,484
[April] <i>You know I did think
it was little bold of Emma
to say,</i>

88
00:04:23,482 --> 00:04:25,902
she has butterflies in front
of me.

89
00:04:25,896 --> 00:04:29,166
Since she probably knows
what's going on with
Joey and I,

90
00:04:29,172 --> 00:04:30,932
that we've had this connection.

91
00:04:30,931 --> 00:04:35,071
Just because Joey and Emma
are around the similar age,

92
00:04:35,068 --> 00:04:39,408
doesn't mean that outweighs
all the time I've spent with Joey.

93
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:43,623
Building something meaningful
that could lead to more.

94
00:04:44,793 --> 00:04:46,003
Next dare it's

95
00:04:46,931 --> 00:04:48,071
you.

96
00:04:48,068 --> 00:04:49,308
Dare.

97
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,380
Do a body shot off Jose.

98
00:04:51,379 --> 00:04:52,719
Oh, no problem.

99
00:04:53,931 --> 00:04:56,901
Jose all you need to do
is take your shirt off
and lay down.

100
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:58,166
It's your sister.

101
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:00,212
- That's all you need to do
- Why you acting so scared?

102
00:05:00,206 --> 00:05:01,826
You live in Miami, come on.

103
00:05:01,827 --> 00:05:04,097
Does that face look,
like, scared?

104
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:06,483
[people cheering]

105
00:05:06,482 --> 00:05:09,832
Praise the Lord. I was just
praying somebody would
tell me to do that.

106
00:05:09,827 --> 00:05:12,477
I think he was more scared
of you.

107
00:05:12,482 --> 00:05:15,522
Scared? I wasn't scared.
No, thanks, Emma.

108
00:05:16,103 --> 00:05:17,283
I slid her a 100 bucks.

109
00:05:19,896 --> 00:05:20,686
Suck it off his nipple.

110
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,930
Oh, geez.

111
00:05:23,931 --> 00:05:27,101
[Mckenna] Suck that tequila
up, let's go.

112
00:05:28,172 --> 00:05:30,172
[people laughing and teasing]

113
00:05:38,275 --> 00:05:40,095
[Mckenna] Get it mommy.
[laughs]

114
00:05:40,793 --> 00:05:41,973
[Emma] You want more?

115
00:05:41,965 --> 00:05:44,275
[Pola] <i>I was watching
but I was not watching.</i>

116
00:05:45,103 --> 00:05:47,483
I was there but I wasn't there so...

117
00:05:48,413 --> 00:05:49,933
<i>It's pretty weird.</i>

118
00:05:49,931 --> 00:05:52,591
Kelle was so happy about it.
I mean it's not fun

119
00:05:53,275 --> 00:05:54,095
My turn.

120
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,590
April,

121
00:05:56,586 --> 00:05:57,586
truth or dare?

122
00:05:57,586 --> 00:06:00,996
[April] Um,

123
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Dare.

124
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,310
[all exclaiming]

125
00:06:06,793 --> 00:06:10,213
I dare you to give Joey
a kiss.

126
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:15,829
I used to be really jealous
when I was younger.

127
00:06:15,827 --> 00:06:18,687
And I see Joey sitting next
to Emma.

128
00:06:18,689 --> 00:06:19,999
And

129
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,380
I was feeling
a little uncomfortable.

130
00:06:22,413 --> 00:06:24,593
But then I just remembered
who I am.

131
00:06:24,586 --> 00:06:27,306
I'm confident that we have
something strong.

132
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:30,931
Move ladies.

133
00:06:34,896 --> 00:06:37,066
He's getting all the,
all the women tonight.

134
00:06:37,068 --> 00:06:37,998
[all chuckling]

135
00:06:40,586 --> 00:06:42,306
Wow, it's like a whole scene.

136
00:06:47,689 --> 00:06:48,899
[April] Okay.

137
00:06:48,896 --> 00:06:50,616
That's cute. That was cute.

138
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:55,000
I am a little surprised that
Jose dared April to kiss you.

139
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,480
<i>But she's, uh, putting Emma
in check, like, "This is my
man girl,</i>

140
00:06:57,482 --> 00:06:58,592
you need to back off."

141
00:06:59,172 --> 00:07:00,312
I like you Joey.

142
00:07:01,793 --> 00:07:04,283
[Joey] <i>I mean as good
as that kiss was,</i>

143
00:07:04,275 --> 00:07:09,785
I just can't get over the way
April's ex Billy was treating
me. But also,

144
00:07:09,793 --> 00:07:14,903
I'm starting
to, you know, get feelings
for Emma a little bit.

145
00:07:14,896 --> 00:07:16,206
<i>So, I don't know,
I'm conflicted.</i>

146
00:07:16,206 --> 00:07:17,926
So, we definitely gotta
have a talk.

147
00:07:21,724 --> 00:07:25,284
So, what do you think
of my son with, beautiful
Stefany?

148
00:07:26,827 --> 00:07:28,377
I see that your son
is precious.

149
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:31,589
He's so respectful.
You've done a great
job raising him.

150
00:07:31,586 --> 00:07:33,276
[hesitates] Excuse me.

151
00:07:33,275 --> 00:07:35,065
Oh, hi.

152
00:07:35,068 --> 00:07:36,278
This is Joey, Mckenna's son.

153
00:07:36,275 --> 00:07:38,095
I'm Joey, nice to meet you.

154
00:07:38,103 --> 00:07:39,623
- He's the younger one.
- You are so beautiful.

155
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,210
- So beautiful.
- Thank you.

156
00:07:41,206 --> 00:07:42,206
And he's my honey.

157
00:07:42,206 --> 00:07:43,896
Mhm

158
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:49,100
But if I could please excuse
you women so I could talk
to April one on one,

159
00:07:49,103 --> 00:07:50,173
I'm so sorry.

160
00:07:50,172 --> 00:07:51,212
[Both] Okay.

161
00:07:51,206 --> 00:07:54,686
Me and April need to have
a talk after

162
00:07:54,689 --> 00:07:56,549
what her ex did at lunch.

163
00:07:56,551 --> 00:08:01,481
Because the way that he picked
her up made it look like they
still had stuff going on.

164
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:05,482
And then, with Emma saying
she likes me now, and that
kiss with April,

165
00:08:05,482 --> 00:08:07,832
I just need to get some
clarity on the situation

166
00:08:07,827 --> 00:08:11,277
to see if April takes me
as seriously as I'm taking her.

167
00:08:11,275 --> 00:08:15,305
I wanted to talk to you about
how our lunch date went.

168
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:19,280
When Billy came in I was
so excited to meet him.

169
00:08:19,275 --> 00:08:24,405
And I feel like when he sat
down he kind of gave me, you
know, the cold shoulder.

170
00:08:24,413 --> 00:08:26,793
Kind of turn away from me and
just look at you

171
00:08:26,793 --> 00:08:29,413
and I get he hasn't seen you
in such a long time.

172
00:08:29,413 --> 00:08:31,173
But at least like give me
a chance

173
00:08:31,172 --> 00:08:33,282
- I understand, yeah.
- to say something.

174
00:08:33,275 --> 00:08:34,995
I understand.

175
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,790
And when he took you away,
I kind of felt, like,

176
00:08:37,793 --> 00:08:39,933
disrespected in a way
because--

177
00:08:39,931 --> 00:08:43,101
- You know, when he did that,
it's just his personality.
- Yeah, yeah.

178
00:08:43,103 --> 00:08:45,173
He's just, like,

179
00:08:45,172 --> 00:08:49,002
whoom, before I knew it,
I'm just like where are we
going? What's happening?

180
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,480
But it kind of just left me
in the dust.

181
00:08:53,827 --> 00:08:56,097
[April] <i>The last thing I ever
wanna do is</i>

182
00:08:56,103 --> 00:08:58,283
have Joey feel disrespected.

183
00:08:58,275 --> 00:09:00,895
<i>Billy has a sense of humor.</i>

184
00:09:00,896 --> 00:09:05,166
And people may not understand
his personality until they get
to know him.

185
00:09:05,172 --> 00:09:08,002
But I would never wanna hurt
Joey's feelings.

186
00:09:08,724 --> 00:09:11,594
- So, mhm.
- So, here's the thing,

187
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:14,686
- you're 20 and...
- Mhmm

188
00:09:14,689 --> 00:09:18,689
- He's my ex-husband,
he's the father of my kids.
- Mhm

189
00:09:18,689 --> 00:09:22,899
I don't think he knew exactly
what was going on, you know,
I mean,

190
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,476
I didn't explain to him that

191
00:09:24,482 --> 00:09:26,282
you and I connected.

192
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:30,165
But I didn't mean for,
you know to leave you out
in any way.

193
00:09:31,172 --> 00:09:32,932
If there's a chance that
you guys will talk,

194
00:09:34,103 --> 00:09:36,903
and he's a super cool guy,
very talented.

195
00:09:36,896 --> 00:09:41,096
Yeah, but if he's not
acknowledging me then

196
00:09:41,103 --> 00:09:44,003
- why waste my energy,
trying to,
- I hear you

197
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,170
you know, acknowledge him.

198
00:09:47,172 --> 00:09:51,172
Even though Billy and April
are divorced, I would
definitely say that

199
00:09:51,172 --> 00:09:54,282
they're a lot closer than
what she's been telling me.

200
00:09:54,275 --> 00:09:56,375
So, I'm not sure what
to think.

201
00:09:56,379 --> 00:09:59,379
<i>I'm annoyed that she's
not really siding with me.</i>

202
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:02,829
<i>Because she knows the way
he was acting was just wrong.</i>

203
00:10:02,827 --> 00:10:04,997
It definitely makes me
question whether

204
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
the chemistry and bond that
we've had is as real as
it felt.

205
00:10:10,275 --> 00:10:12,895
He is a very good person with
a huge heart.

206
00:10:12,896 --> 00:10:15,896
And I would love to see that.
He didn't care to get to know
me at all.

207
00:10:16,413 --> 00:10:17,693
So,

208
00:10:17,689 --> 00:10:19,589
really in my opinion, I,

209
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:22,516
excuse my language
but I could give a [bleep]
to get to know him

210
00:10:22,517 --> 00:10:23,897
- Okay, okay.
- at all.

211
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,483
You are nearing the
end of your time here
at the villa.

212
00:10:30,793 --> 00:10:32,003
No!

213
00:10:33,172 --> 00:10:36,282
And some of you have already
spent your last night here.

214
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
[Ryan] Wait what?

215
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,380
What do you think of Jose?

216
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,100
I think he's amazing.

217
00:10:52,103 --> 00:10:54,693
I think he's a very special person.

218
00:10:54,689 --> 00:11:00,409
I loved meeting his mom
Pola, I loved meeting
Emma his sister.

219
00:11:00,413 --> 00:11:04,523
I love that their very family oriented.

220
00:11:04,517 --> 00:11:09,787
And I loved seeing
your connection.

221
00:11:09,793 --> 00:11:11,863
So, how do you [hesitates]
feel?

222
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,590
- I honestly adore him.
- Mhm

223
00:11:16,586 --> 00:11:22,586
Because I feel like I know
him deeper than what you get
to see here in, like, in day.

224
00:11:22,586 --> 00:11:24,206
You deserve the best
of the best.

225
00:11:24,206 --> 00:11:26,786
You deserve everything that
you want.

226
00:11:26,793 --> 00:11:29,073
I think you need romance.

227
00:11:29,068 --> 00:11:30,618
I know you want that.

228
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:36,280
And if you have any
reservations about romance
with somebody, I think,

229
00:11:36,275 --> 00:11:39,585
take it day by day, do your
thing, have so much fun.

230
00:11:39,586 --> 00:11:40,966
We're almost done. Wow.

231
00:11:40,965 --> 00:11:42,375
- With the best time.
- You're beautiful [indistinct]

232
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:44,969
If not I go home with you.

233
00:11:44,965 --> 00:11:47,895
[McKenna] <i>There's just
a little skepticism from me because</i>

234
00:11:47,896 --> 00:11:51,586
I don't think they've had
enough quality time together.

235
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:56,786
Which knowing my mom,
she needs that quality time
and she needs more

236
00:11:56,793 --> 00:12:00,283
<i>physicality, like, someone
who's very assertive.</i>

237
00:12:00,275 --> 00:12:03,785
And, you know, pin me
against the wall, let me
see the passion.

238
00:12:03,793 --> 00:12:06,793
Um, I don't see that between them.

239
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:11,483
<i>So, without having that,
it made me a little nervous.</i>

240
00:12:12,379 --> 00:12:14,209
[Both] I love you so much.

241
00:12:24,517 --> 00:12:25,477
[Emma] Hello.

242
00:12:25,482 --> 00:12:26,522
Hello, Emma.

243
00:12:26,517 --> 00:12:27,787
- How are you doing?
- I'm good.

244
00:12:27,793 --> 00:12:29,593
- Mhm
- About to leave tomorrow.

245
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,590
- Really?
- Yeah, I'm headed
back home.

246
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,996
- I mean that's really
sad but--
- But

247
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,410
- I wanted to ask you something.
- Mhm

248
00:12:38,413 --> 00:12:42,793
- I know that you're in LA and
I'm in Miami but...
- Mhm

249
00:12:42,793 --> 00:12:49,313
maybe if I go to LA or you
come to Miami do you want,
can I have your phone?

250
00:12:51,586 --> 00:12:57,476
I'm very conflicted because I
don't know if I wanna go with
April or Ms. Emma.

251
00:12:57,482 --> 00:12:59,902
I mean, they're both
great people.

252
00:12:59,896 --> 00:13:02,276
I still don't know Emma
as much but

253
00:13:02,275 --> 00:13:06,375
<i>I'm definitely not 100%
certain that April's got
the same feelings for me.</i>

254
00:13:09,517 --> 00:13:10,897
What do you want
my name under?

255
00:13:12,586 --> 00:13:13,516
- Really?
- Yeah, I'm headed
back home.

256
00:13:15,103 --> 00:13:17,313
I'm definitely keeping my
options open

257
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,970
because I don't know what
to expect from April anymore.

258
00:13:21,206 --> 00:13:22,996
- So, I have your phone number.
- Mhm.

259
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,210
Oh, you got it now.

260
00:13:24,206 --> 00:13:26,096
- I'm gonna text you,
you better answer.
- Yeah.

261
00:13:27,068 --> 00:13:28,068
Later Emma.

262
00:13:28,965 --> 00:13:29,785
Bye.

263
00:13:47,413 --> 00:13:48,483
[phone chimes]

264
00:13:48,482 --> 00:13:50,172
I have a text.

265
00:13:50,172 --> 00:13:51,592
- We got a text.
- Yes!

266
00:13:51,586 --> 00:13:53,376
- [Joey] Get comfortable.
- Oh, boy.

267
00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:57,689
Couples, you are nearing
the end of your time here
at the villa.

268
00:13:57,965 --> 00:13:59,165
No!

269
00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:03,589
Some of you have already spent
your last night here.

270
00:14:04,172 --> 00:14:05,142
[Ryan] Wait what?

271
00:14:07,793 --> 00:14:10,283
You'll each write a letter
to your partner,

272
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,310
stating your intentions.

273
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:17,590
And if you would like this
relationship to continue
outside the villa.

274
00:14:17,586 --> 00:14:20,966
Tomorrow you will read your
letters to each other.

275
00:14:22,172 --> 00:14:25,282
Will you stay together
or go your separate ways?

276
00:14:26,172 --> 00:14:27,592
Only time will tell.

277
00:14:27,586 --> 00:14:29,066
it's so sad.

278
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:34,098
Men, you will now leave
the villa to write your
letters in private.

279
00:14:35,103 --> 00:14:38,103
Ladies, you will stay here
till tomorrow.

280
00:14:39,275 --> 00:14:41,375
What does it mean continue
outside the villa, like?

281
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:44,689
- Yeah I know.
- Like in the future having a
relationship with that person.

282
00:14:45,482 --> 00:14:47,002
[April] I don't like
this text.

283
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,100
I wasn't expecting that.

284
00:14:49,103 --> 00:14:53,003
Knowing that this potentially
could just be the end

285
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,380
<i>It's a little nerve wracking.</i>

286
00:14:54,379 --> 00:14:57,999
I definitely will be
heartbroken if I don't
see Gabriel again.

287
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:00,895
This is a lot to digest.

288
00:15:00,896 --> 00:15:03,616
I'm actually really sad that
this is almost over.

289
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,900
I love spending time
with Jose.

290
00:15:05,896 --> 00:15:09,856
And now we have to write
a letter to say how we feel.

291
00:15:09,862 --> 00:15:16,382
And I think it's gonna be very
hard for me because he's just
such a special man.

292
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:18,589
I'm going to miss everyone.

293
00:15:18,586 --> 00:15:21,096
I feel like we were all, like,
kind of stunned.

294
00:15:21,103 --> 00:15:22,593
Me and the guys
we're all like,

295
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:28,069
"Damn, like, this is it,
we need to make a decision."

296
00:15:28,068 --> 00:15:30,588
I just feel like it's kind of
abrupt and we're all like...

297
00:15:31,793 --> 00:15:34,383
Kind of scared, so I'm
nervous, I'm nervy right now.

298
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,690
Wow.

299
00:15:41,689 --> 00:15:44,689
[Jose] <i>The men in the house
have spent the last night
at the villa.</i>

300
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,170
<i>So, this sparks a lot of mixed
feelings because</i>

301
00:15:49,172 --> 00:15:54,072
outside of this villa it
becomes more real because
we have to align our lives.

302
00:15:54,068 --> 00:15:59,378
And to overcome a 1000 other
obstacles we didn't have before.

303
00:15:59,379 --> 00:16:02,619
<i>So, it's very difficult
to face it.</i>

304
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:06,280
Wow, it's only us four ladies
left in this house.

305
00:16:06,275 --> 00:16:07,995
I have separation anxiety already.

306
00:16:08,689 --> 00:16:09,899
That's kinda scary.

307
00:16:10,862 --> 00:16:11,972
I wasn't expecting that

308
00:16:12,482 --> 00:16:14,762
- Me either.
- at all.

309
00:16:14,758 --> 00:16:18,278
I don't think it was a good
choice for Jose to choose Kelle.

310
00:16:18,275 --> 00:16:23,095
So, I hope this time he
chooses not to be with her.

311
00:16:23,103 --> 00:16:25,973
Maybe it's gonna be the end
of that relationship.

312
00:16:34,482 --> 00:16:38,002
[Kelle] <i>I'm really emotional
writing this letter to Jose
right now because,</i>

313
00:16:41,068 --> 00:16:42,408
I realized it was time
to say goodbye.

314
00:16:43,793 --> 00:16:45,103
I am dying right now.

315
00:16:47,482 --> 00:16:50,862
You know my heart.
Thank you for being
so damn amazing.

316
00:16:51,482 --> 00:16:53,142
Ahh,

317
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:56,377
Do you think there is a chance
for us to be a couple when we
get back to LA?

318
00:17:04,793 --> 00:17:10,143
I remember our first conversation.

319
00:17:11,482 --> 00:17:12,692
<i>I'm writing a letter</i>

320
00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:15,789
whether or not we should either

321
00:17:15,793 --> 00:17:23,283
continue our relationship when
we go back home or we should
just keep it as friends.

322
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:27,095
I feel like even though we've
had plenty of conversations

323
00:17:27,103 --> 00:17:31,173
we haven't gotten down
to the nitty gritty at all.

324
00:17:32,103 --> 00:17:33,793
What does he want for
his life?

325
00:17:33,793 --> 00:17:35,863
<i>Does he wanna have kids?
I have kids.</i>

326
00:17:35,862 --> 00:17:37,482
<i>My kids are in their 20s.</i>

327
00:17:37,482 --> 00:17:41,142
So, there's a lot we've just
scratched the surface with.

328
00:17:41,689 --> 00:17:44,899
<i>And I am worried that,</i>

329
00:17:44,896 --> 00:17:48,446
you know, our gap as far
as our age range,

330
00:17:48,448 --> 00:17:51,138
is quite something and...

331
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:54,237
I don't wanna rob anyone
of their life experience.

332
00:17:54,689 --> 00:17:56,139
So,

333
00:17:56,137 --> 00:17:58,997
I don't really know what
to do right now. I have
to figure it out.

334
00:18:08,551 --> 00:18:11,691
It's not my cup of tea but
I guess we'll give it a try.

335
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,860
"Dear April,

336
00:18:16,034 --> 00:18:19,174
the girl that I've always,,,"
[sighs wearily]

337
00:18:19,172 --> 00:18:20,792
<i>I'm a terrible writer.</i>

338
00:18:20,793 --> 00:18:22,593
So, this is gonna
be very difficult.

339
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:29,032
Yeah, I mean my mind
is racing.

340
00:18:29,034 --> 00:18:31,694
The doubts are definitely
there whether, you know,

341
00:18:31,689 --> 00:18:34,069
I wanna have a relationship
with April

342
00:18:34,068 --> 00:18:36,998
or whether she wants to have
a relationship with me.

343
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,590
<i>After everything that's gone
on with her ex,</i>

344
00:18:40,689 --> 00:18:42,379
I don't know what to do.

345
00:18:42,379 --> 00:18:45,689
"This amazing time,
this journey,

346
00:18:46,689 --> 00:18:48,689
this experience."

347
00:18:52,689 --> 00:18:56,479
Exper... How do you spell
experience? Oh, I can't
do this.

348
00:18:58,793 --> 00:19:00,313
So difficult.

349
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:04,170
I'm actually a little nervous
to really put my thoughts
on paper.

350
00:19:04,172 --> 00:19:07,902
I don't think I've ever
written a letter to any guy.

351
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:10,896
<i>But, you know, Gabriel
is someone special to me.</i>

352
00:19:10,896 --> 00:19:12,586
<i>I'm being very vulnerable.</i>

353
00:19:12,586 --> 00:19:15,586
<i>I'm putting everything out
there, you know, and just</i>

354
00:19:16,068 --> 00:19:17,968
take this by faith.

355
00:19:17,965 --> 00:19:21,375
And see what God's plan
is for me at the end.

356
00:19:21,379 --> 00:19:24,169
I am definitely ready
to be with somebody serious.

357
00:19:24,172 --> 00:19:25,762
I am looking for a partner.

358
00:19:26,482 --> 00:19:28,452
<i>I wanna get married again.</i>

359
00:19:28,448 --> 00:19:33,658
So, you know, I'm hoping that
he could be ready for some
commitment here.

360
00:19:38,793 --> 00:19:40,593
[Gabriel] As I'm writing this <i>letter,</i>

361
00:19:40,586 --> 00:19:45,136
<i>a 1000 thoughts at a 1000
miles per hour is going
through my head and</i>

362
00:19:45,137 --> 00:19:48,787
I know what I like about
Stefany and it is

363
00:19:48,793 --> 00:19:51,903
<i>her genuineness, her sexiness,</i>

364
00:19:51,896 --> 00:19:55,476
how strong and independent
she is and that's my type.

365
00:19:55,482 --> 00:19:59,032
But I'm thinking about how she
has a whole family already.

366
00:19:59,034 --> 00:20:02,284
I personally, you know,
always wanted kids.

367
00:20:02,275 --> 00:20:04,585
I'm thinking about
my lifestyle.

368
00:20:04,586 --> 00:20:07,276
I travel a lot, if I even have time

369
00:20:07,275 --> 00:20:09,685
for something so serious.

370
00:20:10,689 --> 00:20:11,789
Eh, it's just,

371
00:20:13,103 --> 00:20:14,243
it's uncomfortable.

372
00:20:17,586 --> 00:20:19,276
My dear Ryan,

373
00:20:22,172 --> 00:20:25,382
For me it is really difficult
to start a letter because

374
00:20:25,379 --> 00:20:28,279
<i>I wanna be sincere,
I wanna be clear.</i>

375
00:20:28,275 --> 00:20:31,685
<i>But I'm not really clear, my
mind is not clear because
I don't know what's going on.</i>

376
00:20:32,344 --> 00:20:34,284
<i>After I leave the villa...</i>

377
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:36,375
It was the way you made
me laugh.

378
00:20:36,379 --> 00:20:39,479
Being around Ryan, everything
is really fun.

379
00:20:39,482 --> 00:20:41,142
So I have a very good time
being around him.

380
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:45,065
But he lives in Boston I live
in Miami

381
00:20:45,068 --> 00:20:49,278
so I don't know if this
connection will stay as
strong as it is right now.

382
00:20:49,275 --> 00:20:52,335
And that scares me because
I don't know if there's gonna
be a future or not.

383
00:20:56,068 --> 00:20:58,028
Dear Pola

384
00:20:58,034 --> 00:21:03,004
As I write my letter, I'm
using this time to look into
my feelings for Pola.

385
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
And potentially where I can
see this thing really taking
off to.

386
00:21:06,551 --> 00:21:08,141
I started a song,

387
00:21:08,137 --> 00:21:10,277
<i>♪ You ain't gotta hide your
imperfections ♪</i>

388
00:21:10,275 --> 00:21:11,895
<i>♪ I think they sexy ♪</i>

389
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:15,476
This song is unfinished,
because it's a story that
I don't want to end.

390
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,032
<i>That's how I feel about Pola.</i>

391
00:21:17,034 --> 00:21:19,794
That's how I feel about
the time we spent together
in this villa.

392
00:21:19,793 --> 00:21:21,343
<i>I think I did find love here.</i>

393
00:21:21,344 --> 00:21:24,174
And that's not something that
I'm ready to let go.

394
00:21:24,172 --> 00:21:26,662
<i>I'm going to put my heart,
my soul,</i>

395
00:21:26,655 --> 00:21:28,275
all over this letter

396
00:21:28,275 --> 00:21:31,545
<i>And I'm ready to merge
our two worlds.</i>

397
00:21:32,379 --> 00:21:33,899
I'm going all in.

398
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:38,859
[Jose] <i>Writing this letter
is a roller-coaster
of emotions,</i>

399
00:21:38,862 --> 00:21:40,692
<i>I have very special connection
with Kelle,</i>

400
00:21:40,689 --> 00:21:43,659
<i>and we know how we feel
about each other.</i>

401
00:21:43,655 --> 00:21:46,275
But, there are many factors
we need to consider

402
00:21:46,275 --> 00:21:47,785
in order to align our lives,

403
00:21:48,655 --> 00:21:50,655
<i>which makes me question,</i>

404
00:21:50,655 --> 00:21:53,585
<i>if, it's a match for me...</i>

405
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:56,792
or not.

406
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:00,691
[Kelle] <i>I'm really emotional</i>

407
00:22:00,689 --> 00:22:03,479
<i>Writing this letter
to Jose right now because,</i>

408
00:22:03,482 --> 00:22:05,902
I feel like,
I can finally really tell him

409
00:22:05,896 --> 00:22:08,166
how I've been feeling
the whole time
since I met him.

410
00:22:08,965 --> 00:22:10,335
It's like ridiculous,

411
00:22:10,344 --> 00:22:13,174
how fast
someone can impact your life.

412
00:22:13,172 --> 00:22:15,552
[sobs] I don't get it.

413
00:22:17,068 --> 00:22:18,238
For the first time,

414
00:22:18,241 --> 00:22:20,381
I feel like, I really have
connected with somebody

415
00:22:20,379 --> 00:22:23,099
who gets me
and actually has my back

416
00:22:24,241 --> 00:22:26,591
When you talk to--
[voice shaking]

417
00:22:26,586 --> 00:22:28,066
[sniffles]

418
00:22:31,275 --> 00:22:32,375
And, um,

419
00:22:33,241 --> 00:22:35,791
I really just don't wanna
say goodbye.

420
00:22:37,241 --> 00:22:39,591
[sobs] I am dying right now

421
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,446
[sighs, sniffles]

422
00:22:43,482 --> 00:22:45,342
[sniffles]

423
00:22:55,172 --> 00:22:58,592
[Shannan] <i>I have been on pins
and needles about coming back
to the final ceremony.</i>

424
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:01,136
<i>I have no idea what to expect.</i>

425
00:23:01,137 --> 00:23:03,377
I'm hopin'
and I'm praying that,
you know,

426
00:23:03,379 --> 00:23:04,999
this pans out.

427
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,690
<i>For Pola and Ryan.</i>

428
00:23:11,379 --> 00:23:13,659
<i>That was the purpose
of me coming
to this retreat...</i>

429
00:23:13,655 --> 00:23:15,375
to find love.

430
00:23:15,379 --> 00:23:17,789
<i>So, that's all I want for him.</i>

431
00:23:17,793 --> 00:23:19,003
Well, this is excitin'.

432
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,790
- This is it, right?
- Yeah.

433
00:23:21,793 --> 00:23:23,383
[Jimmy] <i>You know we've made
some great connections,</i>

434
00:23:23,379 --> 00:23:25,279
<i>and we just wish the best
for everybody,</i>

435
00:23:25,275 --> 00:23:27,585
- you know.
- Yeah, I wanna see
how they turned out.

436
00:23:27,586 --> 00:23:29,996
- if they find their real love.
- Right?

437
00:23:33,862 --> 00:23:35,072
[Kelle] <i>It's very exciting
to see,</i>

438
00:23:35,068 --> 00:23:37,068
that everyone's
back here at the villa,

439
00:23:37,068 --> 00:23:39,588
to support us
in this very last moment.

440
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:41,856
<i>I'm definitely very nervous.</i>

441
00:23:41,862 --> 00:23:44,002
Knowing that I'm crying
writing the letter,

442
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,280
<i>now I had to read it
in front of 'em.</i>

443
00:23:45,275 --> 00:23:47,335
<i>Like, am I gonna
break down crying?</i> [chuckles]

444
00:23:47,344 --> 00:23:50,174
But, I'm excited
to share with him
how I really feel.

445
00:23:50,172 --> 00:23:51,282
[April] <i>Here we are.</i>

446
00:23:51,275 --> 00:23:54,235
<i>Our journey's
coming to an end.</i>

447
00:23:54,241 --> 00:23:56,001
And, it's very bitter-sweet.

448
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,690
Just, it's time for me
to tell him how I feel and...

449
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:04,029
I just hope
we're both on the same page.

450
00:24:06,379 --> 00:24:08,999
The energy right now
is really intense.

451
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,790
Everybody's looking at me.

452
00:24:10,793 --> 00:24:15,033
<i>And everybody knows
that it's in my hands
to make a decision.</i>

453
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:21,236
[Stefany] <i>It's been a while
since I felt like this
about someone.</i>

454
00:24:21,241 --> 00:24:23,241
<i>I've no idea what Gabriel
is feeling right now,</i>

455
00:24:23,241 --> 00:24:25,171
<i>but I'm definitely anxious
to know,</i>

456
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,342
exactly where his mind
or heart is.

457
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:32,593
Hey.

458
00:24:32,586 --> 00:24:34,476
Aw, nice stud.

459
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,380
Look at you.

460
00:24:36,379 --> 00:24:38,239
Man, so this is it.

461
00:24:38,241 --> 00:24:39,691
Crazy.

462
00:24:39,689 --> 00:24:41,589
Here it goes.
[chuckles nervously]

463
00:24:42,103 --> 00:24:43,863
Hopefully I don't cry.

464
00:24:44,586 --> 00:24:46,896
[smacks lips]
So, dear Gabriel,

465
00:24:46,896 --> 00:24:49,066
I never imagined
that I can open up

466
00:24:49,068 --> 00:24:52,378
to a man of such young age
as I have with you.

467
00:24:53,551 --> 00:24:54,761
Comin' into the villa,

468
00:24:54,758 --> 00:24:57,378
I had no idea
who I was going to meet,

469
00:24:57,379 --> 00:25:00,279
or how this experiment
was going to play out.

470
00:25:00,275 --> 00:25:01,585
[chuckles]

471
00:25:01,586 --> 00:25:03,446
[sniffles] However,

472
00:25:03,448 --> 00:25:06,378
you were the guy
that always stood out to me.

473
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:08,999
- [smacks lips]
- [choking up]
Your confidence...

474
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,170
- [voice shaking]
I'm gonna cry.
- Don't cry.

475
00:25:11,172 --> 00:25:12,212
your energy,

476
00:25:12,206 --> 00:25:14,586
and the love you show
to your mom daily,

477
00:25:14,586 --> 00:25:16,756
was amazingly sweet.

478
00:25:16,758 --> 00:25:20,168
They say, a man that has
a great relationship
with his mom,

479
00:25:20,172 --> 00:25:22,102
is a man that you must keep.

480
00:25:23,275 --> 00:25:25,275
[sniffles] I will forever
be grateful,

481
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:27,585
and cherish every moment
we spent together,

482
00:25:27,586 --> 00:25:29,066
here at the villa.

483
00:25:29,068 --> 00:25:33,138
I don't know
what to call our relationship
once we leave the villa.

484
00:25:33,137 --> 00:25:36,137
But, I want it to be
as deep and loving,

485
00:25:36,137 --> 00:25:38,587
as it is for me today.

486
00:25:38,586 --> 00:25:41,376
Thank you for being
so damn amazing.
[chuckles]

487
00:25:41,379 --> 00:25:43,069
- Ah!
- [sniffles]

488
00:25:43,068 --> 00:25:44,688
[chuckles]

489
00:25:44,689 --> 00:25:47,999
My mom has genuine feelings
towards Gabriel.

490
00:25:49,655 --> 00:25:52,065
[Pola] Aw!

491
00:25:52,068 --> 00:25:56,378
- [crowd clapping]
- So, I'm definitely interested
to see how Gabriel feels,

492
00:25:56,379 --> 00:25:58,339
<i>I think my mom
would definitely be hurt</i>

493
00:25:58,344 --> 00:26:01,004
if Gabriel had said,
the feeling wasn't mutual.

494
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,690
I think she would be upset
it wasn't the result
she wanted.

495
00:26:05,275 --> 00:26:06,405
Dear Stefany,

496
00:26:06,413 --> 00:26:09,553
day one, I immediately wanted
to get to know you.

497
00:26:09,551 --> 00:26:11,661
When I first saw you
by the bar outside,

498
00:26:11,655 --> 00:26:13,025
I was struck by your energy,

499
00:26:13,551 --> 00:26:14,691
and beauty.

500
00:26:14,689 --> 00:26:15,789
- [paper rustles]
- [chuckles]

501
00:26:15,793 --> 00:26:17,383
After our first date,

502
00:26:17,379 --> 00:26:20,169
I knew that I wouldn't want to
spend this journey
with anyone else.

503
00:26:20,172 --> 00:26:22,282
You challenge me
in such a way,

504
00:26:22,275 --> 00:26:25,685
that made me wanna
take my time to build
a genuine connection.

505
00:26:25,689 --> 00:26:27,589
- [paper rustles]
- I wanted to be creative,

506
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:28,786
and go all in to prove

507
00:26:28,793 --> 00:26:30,283
- how special you truly are.
- [paper rustles]

508
00:26:30,275 --> 00:26:32,335
You deserve the best.

509
00:26:32,344 --> 00:26:34,284
I thank you so much for this.

510
00:26:34,275 --> 00:26:36,375
With love, Gabriel Jane.

511
00:26:38,344 --> 00:26:39,794
[Stefany] <i>I am nervous.</i>

512
00:26:39,793 --> 00:26:41,973
I have anxiety...

513
00:26:41,965 --> 00:26:43,655
because Gabriel's letter...

514
00:26:43,655 --> 00:26:47,025
it's coming across like,
he is not ready to commit.

515
00:26:47,034 --> 00:26:49,694
<i>I have no idea
where this is going.</i>

516
00:26:49,689 --> 00:26:52,169
I hope,
this is not the end of us.

517
00:26:52,172 --> 00:26:54,172
[waves splashing]

518
00:26:54,172 --> 00:26:56,692
So, do you think
there's a chance

519
00:26:56,689 --> 00:26:58,969
for us to be a couple,
when we get back to LA?

520
00:27:02,758 --> 00:27:03,788
[exhales]

521
00:27:12,862 --> 00:27:14,172
[waves splashing]

522
00:27:15,448 --> 00:27:17,548
So, do you think
there's a chance

523
00:27:17,551 --> 00:27:19,861
for us to be a couple,
when we get back to LA?

524
00:27:22,965 --> 00:27:24,685
[April] <i>I feel like,
in the real world,</i>

525
00:27:24,689 --> 00:27:26,689
Gabriel and Stefany
may not work.

526
00:27:26,689 --> 00:27:29,379
because Gabriel
is constantly travelling,

527
00:27:29,379 --> 00:27:32,999
<i>and working
and he has so much more</i>

528
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,170
to see and to learn,
as a young man.

529
00:27:36,172 --> 00:27:38,382
And, Stefany is more settled,

530
00:27:38,379 --> 00:27:41,339
and she wants somebody
more stable

531
00:27:41,344 --> 00:27:43,594
and, Gabriel's
just not here yet.

532
00:27:46,758 --> 00:27:50,338
Of course, I'm excited
for our future adventures,

533
00:27:50,344 --> 00:27:53,794
and I can't wait
to get back to LA and...

534
00:27:53,793 --> 00:27:56,483
and give you
a taste of my lifestyle.

535
00:27:56,482 --> 00:27:57,522
Okay.

536
00:27:58,655 --> 00:28:01,065
I was scared of taking it
to that next level.

537
00:28:01,068 --> 00:28:03,028
<i>But, I realized,</i>

538
00:28:03,034 --> 00:28:05,284
that someone
I would wanna be
in a relationship with,

539
00:28:05,275 --> 00:28:08,065
would be someone,
I could be best friends with.

540
00:28:08,068 --> 00:28:11,068
<i>And, I feel like,
Stefany and I, have that.</i>

541
00:28:11,655 --> 00:28:14,025
[Stefany laughing]

542
00:28:14,034 --> 00:28:18,104
I'm excited that I was blessed
to meet this amazing man,

543
00:28:18,103 --> 00:28:20,243
and, I'm gonna take him
to my church,

544
00:28:21,793 --> 00:28:23,593
- Yes. We're gonna have
lots of f--
- I'll burn up.

545
00:28:23,586 --> 00:28:24,476
[both laugh]

546
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,140
Mmm... Ah...

547
00:28:35,137 --> 00:28:38,277
- Joey.
- [crowd claps, hoots]

548
00:28:38,275 --> 00:28:40,235
[Joey] <i>I wrote down
my feelings on a page.</i>

549
00:28:40,241 --> 00:28:42,451
So, I'm feeling
a lot of pressure
reading this.

550
00:28:43,275 --> 00:28:44,585
Looking beautiful.

551
00:28:46,137 --> 00:28:49,067
I mean, I'm nervous
about April's response.

552
00:28:49,068 --> 00:28:51,478
But,
I'm also hopeful because,

553
00:28:51,482 --> 00:28:54,102
I really got a feeling
that she feels the same way.

554
00:28:54,103 --> 00:28:55,903
Dear April,

555
00:28:55,896 --> 00:28:57,276
the second I saw you,

556
00:28:57,275 --> 00:28:59,335
my eyes lit up
like a Christmas tree.

557
00:28:59,344 --> 00:29:00,664
[chuckles]

558
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:03,025
From our very first conversation,

559
00:29:03,034 --> 00:29:04,484
I started a bond with you,

560
00:29:04,482 --> 00:29:07,792
and my mind was completely
open into areas,

561
00:29:07,793 --> 00:29:08,693
I didn't know I had.

562
00:29:10,379 --> 00:29:11,789
You unlocked me.

563
00:29:11,793 --> 00:29:13,103
[chuckling]

564
00:29:13,103 --> 00:29:15,483
You proved to me
that age is just a number

565
00:29:15,482 --> 00:29:17,342
on your driver's license.

566
00:29:17,344 --> 00:29:19,004
[clicks tongue]
That's right, baby.

567
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,100
[Joey] Mmm-hmm.

568
00:29:21,103 --> 00:29:23,453
You have truly
changed my life forever.

569
00:29:23,448 --> 00:29:24,968
Aw!

570
00:29:24,965 --> 00:29:28,685
Without meeting you,
I would never be able to see
my true potential.

571
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,380
Within myself,

572
00:29:31,379 --> 00:29:32,789
or as you would like
to call me,

573
00:29:32,793 --> 00:29:34,283
[chuckles] an old soul.

574
00:29:34,275 --> 00:29:35,375
That's right.

575
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:38,965
You taught me
the art of happiness,

576
00:29:38,965 --> 00:29:39,895
how to communicate,

577
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:43,032
and most importantly,

578
00:29:43,034 --> 00:29:45,454
how to show and receive love,

579
00:29:45,448 --> 00:29:47,378
to the person
you care about most.

580
00:29:48,482 --> 00:29:50,342
To something [indistinct]
April,

581
00:29:50,344 --> 00:29:52,554
I'm so glad I met you.

582
00:29:52,551 --> 00:29:55,661
And I would love
to continue dating
outside of the building.

583
00:29:58,655 --> 00:30:01,785
[April speaking, laughing]

584
00:30:01,793 --> 00:30:03,693
[crowd hooting]

585
00:30:03,689 --> 00:30:04,549
[all laughing]

586
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:08,592
[April] <i>I feel flattered,</i>

587
00:30:08,586 --> 00:30:11,786
that Joey would want
to date me
outside of the villa.

588
00:30:11,793 --> 00:30:13,863
in the real world.

589
00:30:13,862 --> 00:30:17,662
That must mean
that he really sees me
for who I am.

590
00:30:17,655 --> 00:30:21,995
And, it makes me realize
that he does care about me,

591
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,280
as a person.

592
00:30:23,275 --> 00:30:24,895
Dear Joey,

593
00:30:24,896 --> 00:30:27,376
Even though you are only 20,

594
00:30:27,379 --> 00:30:28,999
you have it together.

595
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,140
[inaudible]

596
00:30:30,137 --> 00:30:33,687
- Mmm.
- You said that you saw
a light around me,

597
00:30:33,689 --> 00:30:36,339
and a halo over my h--
[voice shaking, sobs]

598
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:39,166
[sniffles]

599
00:30:39,172 --> 00:30:41,382
[sobs, sniffles]

600
00:30:41,379 --> 00:30:43,339
- [Joey whispers] It's okay.
- [sniffles]

601
00:30:43,344 --> 00:30:46,484
[sobbing, sniffling]
That meant so much to me.

602
00:30:46,482 --> 00:30:50,692
I sincerely have nothing
but good to say about you, Joey.

603
00:30:52,758 --> 00:30:54,688
Thank you, sweet Joey.

604
00:30:54,689 --> 00:30:56,339
And I love you lots.

605
00:30:56,344 --> 00:30:58,904
- Mmm.
- Let's continue
growing together,

606
00:30:58,896 --> 00:31:01,896
and help each other
along our journeys
through life.

607
00:31:01,896 --> 00:31:03,546
And one more thing, Joey.

608
00:31:03,551 --> 00:31:05,381
As a 20 year old man,

609
00:31:05,379 --> 00:31:08,449
I'm sure this will appeal
to you.

610
00:31:09,586 --> 00:31:11,896
You are free, Joey.

611
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:15,997
Free to be close to me...

612
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,760
and close to someone else.

613
00:31:18,758 --> 00:31:21,098
If, for example,

614
00:31:21,103 --> 00:31:25,103
You would like to see
where things go with Emma,

615
00:31:25,103 --> 00:31:27,283
- and where they go
from there...
- Mmm...

616
00:31:29,896 --> 00:31:30,686
[exhales]

617
00:31:32,172 --> 00:31:33,972
- [April speaking]
- I know.

618
00:31:33,965 --> 00:31:36,895
[April and Joey
speaking softly]

619
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,236
I feel like,
it was the right move,

620
00:31:39,241 --> 00:31:41,691
for my mom and Joey
to just be friends.

621
00:31:41,689 --> 00:31:45,859
I feel like,
my mom's not really
ready to be so romantic,

622
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,902
<i>specially with
such a young man</i>

623
00:31:47,896 --> 00:31:50,376
If anything,
I feel a little bad for Joey.

624
00:31:50,379 --> 00:31:53,029
I hope Joey
doesn't take it too rough.

625
00:31:54,275 --> 00:31:57,585
I'm a little hurt,
the way April let me down
on her letter.

626
00:31:57,586 --> 00:31:58,996
I can't wait to take them home

627
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,760
- and put it in my drawer
forever. [chuckles]
- Aw, no.

628
00:32:01,758 --> 00:32:04,588
But, you know, life goes on,
and hey...

629
00:32:04,586 --> 00:32:06,786
<i>you get shot down,
you get back up and...</i>

630
00:32:06,793 --> 00:32:09,593
I really do hope
to find someone
with a soul connection

631
00:32:09,586 --> 00:32:13,096
Could be Emma,
could be someone
five years down that road.

632
00:32:13,103 --> 00:32:14,593
I mean, I just never know.

633
00:32:15,482 --> 00:32:16,342
Oh, my God.

634
00:32:18,137 --> 00:32:19,477
[Joey] So much.

635
00:32:20,172 --> 00:32:22,072
[April] I know, right?

636
00:32:22,068 --> 00:32:23,998
We're leaving the villa as...

637
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,100
[both] BFFs.

638
00:32:25,103 --> 00:32:28,073
Wow, wow!

639
00:32:28,068 --> 00:32:30,758
Your feet look like
they're dying in those heels.

640
00:32:30,758 --> 00:32:32,238
- Ugh, it's terrible.
- [Joey grunts]

641
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:33,141
[April screams]

642
00:32:33,137 --> 00:32:35,027
[both laugh]

643
00:32:38,103 --> 00:32:39,003
[sighs]

644
00:32:41,448 --> 00:32:42,658
[Ryan] <i>Walkin' up,</i>

645
00:32:42,655 --> 00:32:44,785
to present this letter,
feels like judgement day.

646
00:32:47,896 --> 00:32:48,786
Oh!

647
00:32:48,793 --> 00:32:52,003
I feel like I've put
a lot into this,

648
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,790
and this is, um,
this is new for me.

649
00:32:54,793 --> 00:32:56,383
- How are you?
- Very good and you?

650
00:32:56,379 --> 00:32:58,239
- [Ryan] You look amazin'
as usual.
- I missed you.

651
00:32:58,241 --> 00:32:59,691
I missed you too.

652
00:32:59,689 --> 00:33:01,029
[kisses]

653
00:33:01,034 --> 00:33:03,484
I want my yes, you know.

654
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:05,282
I want my yes.
I'm feelin' like...

655
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:07,585
<i>If Pola shuts me down
and she doesn't wanna build
outside of these walls,</i>

656
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:10,026
I am going to be crushed.

657
00:33:11,482 --> 00:33:13,552
Dear Pola,

658
00:33:15,586 --> 00:33:18,656
you are truly
one of the most amazing women,

659
00:33:18,655 --> 00:33:20,135
that I've met in my lifetime.

660
00:33:20,137 --> 00:33:21,857
As our story continues,

661
00:33:21,862 --> 00:33:23,282
I will continue to deliver

662
00:33:24,172 --> 00:33:26,382
and add to every chapter,
as promised.

663
00:33:28,448 --> 00:33:29,758
With unmatched style,

664
00:33:30,482 --> 00:33:32,862
grace, excellence,

665
00:33:32,862 --> 00:33:34,692
and humility,

666
00:33:34,689 --> 00:33:37,969
I see the love that
you are capable of giving.

667
00:33:38,793 --> 00:33:40,863
Culturally, we are different.

668
00:33:40,862 --> 00:33:42,382
but our hearts are the same.

669
00:33:43,448 --> 00:33:45,378
You don't have to hide
your imperfections.

670
00:33:45,379 --> 00:33:47,479
- [chuckles]
- I think they're sexy.

671
00:33:47,482 --> 00:33:50,142
- [chuckles]
- You can be vulnerable,

672
00:33:50,137 --> 00:33:51,687
with me, baby.

673
00:33:51,689 --> 00:33:52,789
I am your protection.

674
00:33:53,482 --> 00:33:54,382
Now...

675
00:33:54,379 --> 00:33:55,379
[laughs]

676
00:33:55,379 --> 00:33:57,069
as promised.

677
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:58,788
This verse to your song,

678
00:33:58,793 --> 00:34:00,663
is unfinished.

679
00:34:00,655 --> 00:34:03,235
Like the business
that I have with you.

680
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:06,141
I invite you to continue,

681
00:34:06,137 --> 00:34:07,787
creating with me,

682
00:34:07,793 --> 00:34:09,593
one baby step at a time.

683
00:34:13,586 --> 00:34:16,786
After listening
to what he told me,
in his letter,

684
00:34:16,793 --> 00:34:19,243
I am really clear about
how I feel about him

685
00:34:19,241 --> 00:34:21,591
and it's in my hands
to make a decision.

686
00:34:21,586 --> 00:34:25,066
<i>- But, I feel scared...</i>
- [paper rustles]

687
00:34:26,172 --> 00:34:28,172
[speaking foreign language Ryan,

688
00:34:28,172 --> 00:34:29,382
My dear, Ryan.

689
00:34:29,379 --> 00:34:31,899
I can't even begin to express,

690
00:34:31,896 --> 00:34:34,996
the emotions
that are currently running
through my head,

691
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
my heart,
and everyone in between.

692
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,590
There have been moments
in my life,

693
00:34:40,586 --> 00:34:44,276
where I have been absent
and just went through
the emotions,

694
00:34:44,275 --> 00:34:48,095
In this case,
I was able to be present
[sniffles]

695
00:34:48,103 --> 00:34:50,003
every moment I experienced
with you.

696
00:34:51,862 --> 00:34:54,172
While we explore
other possibilities,

697
00:34:54,172 --> 00:34:56,692
we were still looking
for each other's company.

698
00:34:56,689 --> 00:34:58,279
That's when I realized,

699
00:34:58,275 --> 00:35:01,895
I shouldn't be afraid
and just go for it.

700
00:35:01,896 --> 00:35:03,686
Thank you for my song.

701
00:35:03,689 --> 00:35:08,549
[sniffles] And let our future
decide the last words
of the song.

702
00:35:08,551 --> 00:35:09,861
- [Ryan] Okay.
- Of our song.

703
00:35:09,862 --> 00:35:12,282
So, what I'm saying,
to be clear is...

704
00:35:12,275 --> 00:35:13,335
[sniffles]

705
00:35:14,137 --> 00:35:17,027
Every story has a beginning...

706
00:35:17,689 --> 00:35:20,689
a middle, and an end.

707
00:35:20,689 --> 00:35:23,279
Or a continuance,
in this case,

708
00:35:23,275 --> 00:35:27,375
I believe, there is room
for more chapters
to be written.

709
00:35:27,379 --> 00:35:29,659
Like coming to Miami will too.

710
00:35:29,655 --> 00:35:32,335
[Ryan yells] Hey!
I will come to Miami.

711
00:35:32,344 --> 00:35:33,794
[both laughing]

712
00:35:33,793 --> 00:35:35,663
[crowd hooting]

713
00:35:37,379 --> 00:35:39,859
I'm ecstatic
for Pola and Ryan.

714
00:35:39,862 --> 00:35:43,792
I am so happy that
she followed her heart.

715
00:35:43,793 --> 00:35:46,793
<i>Long term,
I do see great potential,</i>

716
00:35:46,793 --> 00:35:48,383
for Ryan and Pola.

717
00:35:51,137 --> 00:35:53,447
[Pola] <i>You surprised me.
That letter was amazing.</i>

718
00:35:53,448 --> 00:35:54,688
I couldn't handle it.

719
00:35:54,689 --> 00:35:55,689
It was beautiful.

720
00:35:55,689 --> 00:35:57,379
Good good.
I love to surprise you.

721
00:35:57,379 --> 00:35:58,829
You always do.

722
00:35:58,827 --> 00:36:00,897
I'm excited about
takin' our relationship
to the next level.

723
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:02,966
It's somethin'
I'm lookin' forward to.

724
00:36:02,965 --> 00:36:05,785
Yes. The next step is
no kids, no moms.

725
00:36:05,793 --> 00:36:07,483
The next step,
no kids--

726
00:36:07,482 --> 00:36:09,902
- No kids, no moms.
- no m-- unless you want
some more kids.

727
00:36:09,896 --> 00:36:10,896
- No, no, no, no.
- You want some--

728
00:36:10,896 --> 00:36:12,656
- I'm fine with two.
- [both laughing]

729
00:36:21,034 --> 00:36:23,284
[Kelle] <i>While I'm standing
there, waiting for Jose
to walk up the stairs.</i>

730
00:36:23,275 --> 00:36:26,095
I'm like, oh, my God.
Please don't dump me.

731
00:36:26,103 --> 00:36:27,483
<i>Ugh!</i>

732
00:36:29,172 --> 00:36:32,282
[crowd hooting, clapping]

733
00:36:33,896 --> 00:36:34,756
Wow.

734
00:36:35,689 --> 00:36:36,899
Are you nervous?

735
00:36:37,275 --> 00:36:38,165
Very.

736
00:36:38,172 --> 00:36:40,002
It's okay.

737
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,790
[Jose] <i>I'm feeling
very anxious.</i>

738
00:36:41,793 --> 00:36:44,453
I know what my decision is
about Kelle.

739
00:36:44,448 --> 00:36:46,098
I just don't wanna
disappoint her.

740
00:37:02,275 --> 00:37:03,475
- Look good.
- You look amazing.

741
00:37:03,482 --> 00:37:05,382
Thanks, so do you.

742
00:37:05,379 --> 00:37:08,339
[Jose] <i>I'm ready to tell Kelle
how I feel.</i>

743
00:37:08,344 --> 00:37:10,974
I don't know how well
or bad it can go.

744
00:37:12,448 --> 00:37:14,338
Uh... [sighs]

745
00:37:14,344 --> 00:37:16,904
From the first time I saw you,
I was like,

746
00:37:16,896 --> 00:37:17,966
wow!

747
00:37:17,965 --> 00:37:19,785
And you just did it again.

748
00:37:19,793 --> 00:37:21,593
Then, when we first spoke,

749
00:37:21,586 --> 00:37:25,166
I thought you weren't real
because you seemed to be
too perfect.

750
00:37:25,172 --> 00:37:29,592
When you talk to people,
I can tell you listen
to everything they say.

751
00:37:29,586 --> 00:37:32,896
[sniffles] And that's when
I knew, you were really
something special.

752
00:37:34,103 --> 00:37:36,033
When you accepted
our first date,

753
00:37:36,034 --> 00:37:38,974
it made me so nervous,
yet so excited.

754
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,855
I remember you saying,

755
00:37:40,862 --> 00:37:42,762
you take things very slow.

756
00:37:42,758 --> 00:37:45,278
So, I decided, back off.

757
00:37:45,275 --> 00:37:49,135
Then I waited patiently
hoping that if we had
some more time together.

758
00:37:49,137 --> 00:37:50,337
- [Kelle sniffles]
- [paper rustles]

759
00:37:50,344 --> 00:37:54,454
We could see if this could
blossom into something more.

760
00:37:54,448 --> 00:37:56,548
I know we have distance
between us.

761
00:37:57,655 --> 00:37:59,475
But I'm willing
to make that effort.

762
00:37:59,482 --> 00:38:02,692
to keep this connection going,
to see where it goes.

763
00:38:04,275 --> 00:38:05,275
So, Jose,

764
00:38:06,172 --> 00:38:08,242
it's an easy decision for me.

765
00:38:08,241 --> 00:38:10,451
to want to spend
more and more time with you.

766
00:38:10,448 --> 00:38:14,588
I wanna lift you up,
empower you and cheer you on,

767
00:38:14,586 --> 00:38:17,096
into becoming the man
that you were created to be.

768
00:38:18,103 --> 00:38:21,103
Love, Kelle a.k.a Disco Mommy.

769
00:38:21,103 --> 00:38:22,593
[both chuckle]

770
00:38:22,586 --> 00:38:24,896
- Thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

771
00:38:24,896 --> 00:38:27,996
Hearing how she's expressing
herself about me,

772
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,450
generates a lot of pressure,

773
00:38:29,448 --> 00:38:32,858
in terms of the expectation
that she has,

774
00:38:32,862 --> 00:38:34,282
<i>from what I have to say.</i>

775
00:38:34,275 --> 00:38:36,375
And I'm nervous about it.

776
00:38:37,172 --> 00:38:38,142
Now it's my turn.

777
00:38:38,137 --> 00:38:39,137
Oh, God.

778
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,480
Dear Kelle,

779
00:38:41,482 --> 00:38:44,342
there are so many things
that I wanna say.

780
00:38:44,344 --> 00:38:48,974
You are a bright, brave
and admirable woman.

781
00:38:50,241 --> 00:38:52,341
So full of energy and life.

782
00:38:52,344 --> 00:38:54,694
I know we have both enjoyed
each moment each day,

783
00:38:54,689 --> 00:38:55,789
[paper rustles]

784
00:38:55,793 --> 00:38:57,553
Oh!

785
00:38:57,551 --> 00:39:00,551
I'm nervous for my mom.
I'm just really hoping that

786
00:39:00,551 --> 00:39:03,031
Jose feels the same way
that my mom does.

787
00:39:05,344 --> 00:39:08,484
As this part of our adventure
comes to an end,

788
00:39:08,482 --> 00:39:11,382
I am hopeful
we will have new ones,

789
00:39:11,379 --> 00:39:13,169
to look forward to,

790
00:39:13,172 --> 00:39:14,382
together.

791
00:39:14,379 --> 00:39:17,379
Yours truly, Jose.

792
00:39:17,379 --> 00:39:19,339
Aw!

793
00:39:21,482 --> 00:39:23,072
[crowd clapping]

794
00:39:24,172 --> 00:39:25,662
[Pola] <i>I'm a little bit disappointed,</i>

795
00:39:25,655 --> 00:39:29,335
but, Jose has something
with Kelle.

796
00:39:29,344 --> 00:39:31,174
He feels good around her.

797
00:39:31,172 --> 00:39:34,002
So, at the beginning
it was really difficult
to know Kelle

798
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
and maybe I misunderstood her.

799
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,240
<i>But at this moment,
I see her intentions</i>

800
00:39:39,241 --> 00:39:41,281
and she has good intentions
with Jose.

801
00:39:41,275 --> 00:39:43,855
<i>So, I need to give them
a chance.</i>

802
00:39:43,862 --> 00:39:46,172
When can you come to LA?

803
00:39:47,689 --> 00:39:48,589
Is tomorrow too soon?

804
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:50,166
[both laugh]

805
00:39:50,172 --> 00:39:52,282
[Joey] I'm ecstatic for my mom
and Jose,

806
00:39:52,275 --> 00:39:54,275
<i>because,
she really deserves someone,</i>

807
00:39:54,275 --> 00:39:57,755
who knows how to handle
all of her energy,

808
00:39:57,758 --> 00:40:00,068
<i>and is on the same wavelength
as her,</i>

809
00:40:00,068 --> 00:40:02,338
when it comes to giving love
and receiving love.

810
00:40:02,344 --> 00:40:04,864
[all cheering]

811
00:40:04,862 --> 00:40:07,032
Get up, get up.

812
00:40:07,034 --> 00:40:08,554
[Jose] <i>Today was
a very special day.</i>

813
00:40:08,551 --> 00:40:10,341
<i>We both had an opportunity</i>

814
00:40:10,344 --> 00:40:12,904
to express our feelings
to each other and I think,

815
00:40:13,689 --> 00:40:15,689
- it went great.
- [Kelle chuckles]

816
00:40:15,689 --> 00:40:17,169
[Joey] My God!

817
00:40:17,172 --> 00:40:19,662
[Jose] <i>In this house we found
something magical.</i>

818
00:40:19,655 --> 00:40:21,545
[Kelle] <i>I was hoping
from day one,</i>

819
00:40:21,551 --> 00:40:23,481
<i>I would be with him...
the whole time.</i>

820
00:40:23,482 --> 00:40:24,902
[Jose] Mmm.

821
00:40:26,103 --> 00:40:27,243
- How's it been?
- It's good to see you.

822
00:40:27,241 --> 00:40:28,481
- You too.
- [crowd speaking indistinctly]

823
00:40:28,482 --> 00:40:30,762
You look happy.

824
00:40:30,758 --> 00:40:33,688
- [both laugh]
- [Shannan] <i>I would say,
this experience with him,</i>

825
00:40:33,689 --> 00:40:37,239
has definitely
taken our relationship
to another level.

826
00:40:37,241 --> 00:40:40,341
Um, it has helped me
appreciate him,
as a young man,

827
00:40:40,344 --> 00:40:41,904
not just my son.

828
00:40:41,896 --> 00:40:44,136
Uh, I've got to learn somethings,

829
00:40:44,137 --> 00:40:46,687
probably way more
than I needed to learn.

830
00:40:46,689 --> 00:40:47,589
[both laugh]

831
00:40:47,586 --> 00:40:49,376
<i>But, nonetheless,</i>

832
00:40:49,379 --> 00:40:51,069
<i>if I had to do it all
over again,
I would.</i>

833
00:40:51,068 --> 00:40:52,788
It was a special time.

834
00:40:52,793 --> 00:40:53,793
[crowd speaking indistinctly]

835
00:40:53,793 --> 00:40:55,103
Wow, what a journey!

836
00:40:55,103 --> 00:40:58,003
[Billy] Yeah! We did it!

837
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,660
- [Stefany] I know!
- [Billy] We did it.

838
00:41:00,655 --> 00:41:03,895
[Stefany] <i>I think
this experience
has made us, um,</i>

839
00:41:03,896 --> 00:41:06,276
you know, realize that,
hey have fun,

840
00:41:06,275 --> 00:41:08,585
and you know,
age is just a number.

841
00:41:08,586 --> 00:41:12,236
Definitely,
keep your options open.

842
00:41:12,241 --> 00:41:15,451
and only God would,
you know, guide you,

843
00:41:15,448 --> 00:41:18,898
<i>to make the right decision.</i>

844
00:41:18,896 --> 00:41:21,896
[Kelle] <i>You really did embrace
every moment of this journey.</i>

845
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,786
<i>Even though there were so many
twists and turns,</i>

846
00:41:23,793 --> 00:41:26,483
and things that were
completely unexpected.

847
00:41:26,482 --> 00:41:28,692
You took everything, like,
with a grain of salt.

848
00:41:28,689 --> 00:41:29,789
<i>and I'm very proud of you.</i>

849
00:41:29,793 --> 00:41:31,383
I wouldn't wanna do it
with anyone else.

850
00:41:31,379 --> 00:41:32,479
Thanks, Mom.

851
00:41:32,482 --> 00:41:34,902
<i>Even though she's known me
my whole life,</i>

852
00:41:34,896 --> 00:41:37,446
we still learn things that
we've never known
about each other.

853
00:41:37,448 --> 00:41:40,758
One thing I learned about you is...

854
00:41:40,758 --> 00:41:43,788
the bathroom is always a mess
with all your make up.

855
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:45,383
But, I still love you.

856
00:41:45,379 --> 00:41:47,379
That's it?
That's all you learned?

857
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:49,099
Yeah. I already know
everything about you.

858
00:41:49,103 --> 00:41:52,863
- Oh!
- I knew you were gonna be crazy...

859
00:41:52,862 --> 00:41:55,032
in a good way.

860
00:41:55,034 --> 00:41:57,484
- We found a family here.
- [women] Yes.

861
00:41:57,482 --> 00:42:00,552
Like, more than anything,
like. you guys are so special,

862
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:03,001
- every single one of you.
I love you guys.
- Cheers!

863
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,280
We learned that
there's happiness

864
00:42:06,275 --> 00:42:09,025
<i>and there's love to be found.</i>

865
00:42:09,034 --> 00:42:12,034
and only that,
that we are not obstacles,

866
00:42:12,034 --> 00:42:14,694
in each other's love life.

867
00:42:14,689 --> 00:42:15,659
which is very nice.

868
00:42:15,655 --> 00:42:17,335
[Pola speaking]

869
00:42:17,344 --> 00:42:20,034
And, that's something
I didn't understand

870
00:42:20,034 --> 00:42:23,174
until I did this.

871
00:42:23,172 --> 00:42:26,282
- and was part of this
wonderful experience.
- Yeah.

872
00:42:26,275 --> 00:42:27,995
- To our mothers.
- [crowd] Cheers!

873
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,170
- And to the sons.
- Our babies.

874
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:32,692
- [yells] To the villa.
To the villa.
- [all cheering]

875
00:42:32,689 --> 00:42:35,689
[all] Cheers!
