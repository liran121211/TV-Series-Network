[narrator]
<i>Previously on</i> Milf Manor...

2
00:00:03,275 --> 00:00:05,025
Everywhere I go, I feel like
there's nobody there.

3
00:00:05,034 --> 00:00:06,834
But when I'm with you,
I feel like there's somebody

4
00:00:06,827 --> 00:00:09,097
that's in there that like,
you know, that exists.

5
00:00:09,103 --> 00:00:10,833
I understand.
I feel the same way.

6
00:00:10,827 --> 00:00:12,827
[Jimmy] <i>I feel really good
about Pola right now.</i>

7
00:00:12,827 --> 00:00:15,167
<i>She makes me feel lost
in the moments.</i>

8
00:00:15,172 --> 00:00:16,622
<i>And I think
that's really important.</i>

9
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,280
I've never really had that.

10
00:00:18,275 --> 00:00:20,545
It feels so nice with her.

11
00:00:20,551 --> 00:00:22,171
[Pola] <i>I've a great connection
with Jimmy.</i>

12
00:00:22,172 --> 00:00:23,622
He makes me feel
really special

13
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,140
when I'm around him.
He does.

14
00:00:26,241 --> 00:00:28,311
- [Ryan] I love your company.
- [Pola] Thank you.

15
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31,860
I think you are a magnificent
and exquisite woman.

16
00:00:31,862 --> 00:00:34,622
I feel like Pola
is the person for me

17
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:39,340
because I probably never met
a woman who is so elegant
and humble.

18
00:00:39,344 --> 00:00:41,724
And that's something
that I admire.

19
00:00:41,724 --> 00:00:43,904
- [Pola] I don't want
to go from here.
- Then don't leave.

20
00:00:43,896 --> 00:00:45,716
- No, I'm not gonna leave.
- Stay here with me.

21
00:00:45,724 --> 00:00:47,694
[Pola] <i>I feel I'm really happy
with Ryan</i>

22
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:50,169
<i>because he makes everything
really special.</i>

23
00:00:50,172 --> 00:00:52,932
And it's really difficult
for me

24
00:00:52,931 --> 00:00:55,411
<i>to choose between
Ryan and Jimmy.</i>

25
00:00:55,413 --> 00:00:56,763
Argh!

26
00:00:56,758 --> 00:00:57,998
You're really special.

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,340
- You're special.
- Thank you.

28
00:00:59,344 --> 00:01:01,764
Jose gives me lots of
butterflies, get nervous,

29
00:01:01,758 --> 00:01:03,828
and I get giggle,
and I don't know what to do.

30
00:01:03,827 --> 00:01:04,967
Mwah!

31
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:07,655
How do you feel when you see
the exterior of me?

32
00:01:07,655 --> 00:01:09,065
I'm gonna say your elegance.

33
00:01:09,068 --> 00:01:10,758
That's hot. I like Jose.

34
00:01:10,758 --> 00:01:12,168
<i>He's my one and only.</i>

35
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:14,242
He has my attention.

36
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,171
[Pola]
<i>Jose is not in my room.</i>

37
00:01:16,172 --> 00:01:17,452
<i>I have no idea why.</i>

38
00:01:17,448 --> 00:01:20,448
Like, I try to text him,
but I haven't had any answer.

39
00:01:20,448 --> 00:01:21,788
And that's really weird.

40
00:01:23,448 --> 00:01:24,788
- Here we are.
- Thank you.

41
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,933
We are enjoying
this beautiful moment.

42
00:01:26,931 --> 00:01:29,211
The fact that Jose is really
stepping up right now

43
00:01:29,206 --> 00:01:30,376
<i>is huge for me.</i>

44
00:01:30,379 --> 00:01:32,069
<i>Like, he's always been
my number one.</i>

45
00:01:32,068 --> 00:01:34,408
Everything about Jose
is amazing.

46
00:01:37,034 --> 00:01:38,524
He didn't sleep in my room.

47
00:01:38,517 --> 00:01:40,897
Excuse me. I have no words.

48
00:01:40,896 --> 00:01:43,546
I am devastated.

49
00:01:43,551 --> 00:01:46,521
Tomorrow, it will be the time
to choose your match.

50
00:01:46,517 --> 00:01:49,587
If your choice is a mismatch,
you could go home.

51
00:01:49,586 --> 00:01:50,856
[Ryan] <i>I'm a bit
shell shocked.</i>

52
00:01:50,862 --> 00:01:52,212
That's a lot of pressure.

53
00:01:52,206 --> 00:01:53,586
Yeah.

54
00:01:54,862 --> 00:01:56,172
That is a little bit scary.

55
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,278
Oh, I got a text, Gabriel.
Hold on.

56
00:02:13,551 --> 00:02:16,101
The time has come to see
if you found a match.

57
00:02:17,931 --> 00:02:19,341
Text the name of the person
you want to

58
00:02:19,344 --> 00:02:22,174
continue your journey
with here, if you have one.

59
00:02:22,172 --> 00:02:25,862
If the feeling is mutual,
you will stay in the villa.

60
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,450
However,
if your choice is a mismatch

61
00:02:30,448 --> 00:02:33,138
or you don't enter a name...

62
00:02:33,137 --> 00:02:35,787
...you will be
leaving the villa today.

63
00:02:36,172 --> 00:02:37,762
Wow.

64
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:39,518
So enter your matches
name now.

65
00:02:41,896 --> 00:02:44,996
We need to select who we have
the strongest connection with,

66
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,280
with the hopes that
that person feels the same.

67
00:02:50,517 --> 00:02:52,687
So what are we doing?

68
00:02:52,689 --> 00:02:56,719
From day one, my connection's
always been more so with Jose.

69
00:02:56,724 --> 00:02:58,314
So I'm... I'm texting Jose.

70
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,070
- I'm going with that.
- Okay.

71
00:03:00,068 --> 00:03:03,518
I know that
we have a connection.

72
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:06,377
However, you know,
he did not ask me out.

73
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:08,409
I mean, Pola went on a date
with Jimmy, too, so.

74
00:03:08,413 --> 00:03:09,553
[Shannan] That's true.

75
00:03:10,896 --> 00:03:14,306
Despite the fact that Jose
has snuck out with Kelle,

76
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:18,340
<i>I still believe in me
and I still know</i>

77
00:03:18,344 --> 00:03:20,764
the thoughtful conversations

78
00:03:20,758 --> 00:03:22,518
and connection that
he and I share,

79
00:03:22,517 --> 00:03:24,717
which that
in itself is special.

80
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:28,412
I got to believe that
real connection

81
00:03:28,413 --> 00:03:30,723
will supersede
and intrigue every day.

82
00:03:32,344 --> 00:03:34,724
I got a whole fun
and believing in that.

83
00:03:34,724 --> 00:03:36,244
- Regardless, you know
I'm here for you.
- I know.

84
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:39,659
- So are you, my baby.
- [Ryan] There we go.

85
00:03:39,655 --> 00:03:42,965
<i>I'm proud of my mom
going for what she wants,</i>

86
00:03:42,965 --> 00:03:44,785
but I'm not necessarily

87
00:03:44,793 --> 00:03:47,723
so sure if Jose
will pick my mom.

88
00:03:47,724 --> 00:03:50,524
And that concerns me
a little bit.

89
00:03:50,517 --> 00:03:51,687
It does.

90
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:53,789
Oh, this is getting wild.

91
00:03:53,793 --> 00:03:55,483
Yeah.
I'm going all the way.

92
00:03:55,482 --> 00:03:57,142
I'm... I'm not just,
like, playing games.

93
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:59,337
- I'll go with my feelings.
- Yeah, go with your feelings.

94
00:03:59,344 --> 00:04:01,974
- And that's real,
trust me, so.
- Yeah.

95
00:04:01,965 --> 00:04:05,755
Even though I knew that Kelle
and Jose have a connection,

96
00:04:05,758 --> 00:04:07,928
I just go with Jose

97
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:09,861
because I don't want to
just play game.

98
00:04:09,862 --> 00:04:11,762
I want to show that
that's real.

99
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,970
I still have that little hope
that Jose will pick me.

100
00:04:17,965 --> 00:04:19,095
Yep.

101
00:04:19,103 --> 00:04:20,553
Love you.

102
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:24,281
[Jose]
<i>So let's see what happens
with these matches</i>

103
00:04:24,275 --> 00:04:26,205
and where we're
going from here.

104
00:04:26,206 --> 00:04:27,716
This is gonna be tough.

105
00:04:27,724 --> 00:04:29,694
<i>This is gonna be
very emotional</i>

106
00:04:29,689 --> 00:04:31,279
<i>because of all the people that</i>

107
00:04:31,275 --> 00:04:33,545
<i>I've done strong
connections with.</i>

108
00:04:33,551 --> 00:04:35,971
So to make the decision,

109
00:04:35,965 --> 00:04:38,685
I'm trusting my gut
and my feelings.

110
00:04:38,689 --> 00:04:41,859
And those feelings
are pointing

111
00:04:41,862 --> 00:04:43,452
towards one person.

112
00:04:44,275 --> 00:04:45,785
I'm between
two different names,

113
00:04:45,793 --> 00:04:47,553
but one of them,

114
00:04:48,931 --> 00:04:51,591
I feel like the connection
more as a friendship.

115
00:04:51,586 --> 00:04:53,616
And the other one
is more like,

116
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,030
uh, maybe there's a feud.

117
00:04:55,034 --> 00:04:56,864
- [Jose] Possibility.
- Yeah.

118
00:04:56,862 --> 00:04:58,902
I really don't know what to do

119
00:04:58,896 --> 00:05:03,856
because I really love
the company of Ryan and Jimmy.

120
00:05:03,862 --> 00:05:05,592
Uh,
they're completely different,

121
00:05:05,586 --> 00:05:06,656
<i>I understand.</i>

122
00:05:06,655 --> 00:05:08,855
<i>And I don't want to
hurt anyone's feelings.</i>

123
00:05:08,862 --> 00:05:10,452
<i>Obviously,
you have to pick one.</i>

124
00:05:10,448 --> 00:05:11,788
I mean, you have to
make a decision.

125
00:05:11,793 --> 00:05:13,343
You cannot stay
with both of them.

126
00:05:13,344 --> 00:05:14,554
So...

127
00:05:15,793 --> 00:05:17,213
I'm gonna write...

128
00:05:19,241 --> 00:05:20,621
I'm gonna send it.

129
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,860
Wow.

130
00:05:23,655 --> 00:05:24,615
Yeah.

131
00:05:26,724 --> 00:05:28,144
I guess I have
to do the same.

132
00:05:30,172 --> 00:05:34,662
I really think the best match
for Jose is Shannon, 100%.

133
00:05:34,655 --> 00:05:36,855
<i>I don't feel Kelle
is right for Jose.</i>

134
00:05:36,862 --> 00:05:38,032
I really don't.

135
00:05:38,034 --> 00:05:40,554
I think it's very important
for me that my mom sees

136
00:05:40,551 --> 00:05:42,621
<i>what I see in the woman
that I choose.</i>

137
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,340
Because when you're
with someone,

138
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:46,864
you're not only
with that person,

139
00:05:46,862 --> 00:05:49,452
you're with that
person's circle.

140
00:05:49,448 --> 00:05:53,278
And having those people accept

141
00:05:53,275 --> 00:05:57,165
and have a good relationship
with your significant other,

142
00:05:57,172 --> 00:06:00,792
it brings a lot of peace
and value...

143
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:03,413
- I feel the same way
with Jose.
- ...in the relationship.

144
00:06:03,413 --> 00:06:05,173
I'm sure whoever leaves,

145
00:06:05,172 --> 00:06:06,862
they're gonna have
good memories

146
00:06:06,862 --> 00:06:08,722
from you and me,
and that's something

147
00:06:08,724 --> 00:06:10,174
that I really like.

148
00:06:13,965 --> 00:06:15,615
[Gabriel] This whole thing,
it just,

149
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,620
is kind of making it so real.

150
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,550
<i>And I have to make
a decision now.</i>

151
00:06:19,551 --> 00:06:20,971
You know, it's kind of scary.

152
00:06:20,965 --> 00:06:23,235
It's making me have
butterflies in my stomach.

153
00:06:25,724 --> 00:06:28,344
[Charlene] <i>I picked Ryan
as for my connection,</i>

154
00:06:28,344 --> 00:06:31,904
<i>and I think that we have
something to build off of.</i>

155
00:06:31,896 --> 00:06:35,276
So people are going home today
and I am not thinking

156
00:06:35,275 --> 00:06:36,685
that it's going to be me.

157
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,380
[Kelle] <i>I'm a little concerned
that maybe my connection</i>

158
00:06:41,379 --> 00:06:44,999
with Jose isn't as strong
as his with somebody else,

159
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,860
but I don't know
what his relationships

160
00:06:47,862 --> 00:06:49,692
look like with the other woman
in the villa.

161
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:51,689
I only know how ours are
and how he makes me feel

162
00:06:51,689 --> 00:06:52,829
when we're together.

163
00:06:52,827 --> 00:06:56,587
I feel like we have
the strongest connection here.

164
00:06:56,586 --> 00:06:59,856
If Jose doesn't pick me,
I would be shocked.

165
00:06:59,862 --> 00:07:03,692
And if he picks Shannan,
I'll be pissed, absolutely.

166
00:07:05,172 --> 00:07:06,382
[phone vibrates]

167
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:08,239
I got a text.

168
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:09,929
Oh, boy.

169
00:07:09,931 --> 00:07:11,341
Oh-oh.

170
00:07:11,344 --> 00:07:12,484
[woman] Here we go.

171
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,520
"Congratulations."

172
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,280
You have a match.

173
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,450
You and Stefany
chose each other.

174
00:07:23,448 --> 00:07:25,898
You're both staying
to explore your connections.

175
00:07:25,896 --> 00:07:27,926
- [woman] Yay!
- Yay!

176
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,550
[indistinct]

177
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:33,411
- I'm so happy.
- Yay!

178
00:07:33,413 --> 00:07:36,173
This feels so amazing
right now to know that

179
00:07:36,172 --> 00:07:37,862
we both chose each other,

180
00:07:37,862 --> 00:07:40,932
and it could potentially
be something solid.

181
00:07:40,931 --> 00:07:43,831
- So I get your approval?
- You have my approval.

182
00:07:43,827 --> 00:07:47,097
I came here to find the one,
and I feel that Gabriel

183
00:07:47,103 --> 00:07:49,003
could potentially be the one.

184
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,100
- Do you approve?
- I do.

185
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:52,623
[all cheering]

186
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,380
[phone vibrates]

187
00:07:54,379 --> 00:07:56,139
I got a text.

188
00:07:56,137 --> 00:07:58,407
Oh, it's so dramatic.
I feel it.

189
00:07:58,965 --> 00:08:01,025
Oh, my God.

190
00:08:01,034 --> 00:08:02,694
[indistinct]

191
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:03,719
Really?

192
00:08:03,724 --> 00:08:05,174
Come, come, come.

193
00:08:05,172 --> 00:08:08,172
I needed to make a decision,
but it wasn't easy,

194
00:08:08,172 --> 00:08:09,522
and it's still not easy.

195
00:08:10,758 --> 00:08:14,168
Jimmy and Ryan both chose you
for their match.

196
00:08:16,482 --> 00:08:18,862
Who did you choose?

197
00:08:18,862 --> 00:08:22,592
[Jimmy] <i>I find Pola absolutely
beautiful inside and out.</i>

198
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:24,896
I know from the time
that I've spent with Pola,

199
00:08:24,896 --> 00:08:27,476
she is a person
that I would be interested

200
00:08:27,482 --> 00:08:28,762
in on the outside world.

201
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,378
And I'm just hoping
that she feels

202
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:31,409
the same way about me.

203
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:34,384
I really like Pola's spirit.

204
00:08:35,551 --> 00:08:38,311
Just the fact like,
like she is so open.

205
00:08:39,344 --> 00:08:40,974
<i>I think me and Pola
are building a romance.</i>

206
00:08:40,965 --> 00:08:44,025
I think it's becoming
more physical day by day.

207
00:08:44,034 --> 00:08:46,004
I think she's more comfortable
with me day by day.

208
00:08:46,931 --> 00:08:48,241
So I think Pola and Jimmy

209
00:08:48,241 --> 00:08:50,691
have a different type
of connection.

210
00:08:51,793 --> 00:08:53,723
<i>But I will say
there's always that</i>

211
00:08:53,724 --> 00:08:56,004
small piece of doubt
that creeps into your head.

212
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,900
<i>I'm not really
a nervous person,</i>

213
00:08:57,896 --> 00:08:59,096
<i>but it's kind of
nerve-wracking</i>

214
00:08:59,103 --> 00:09:01,313
<i>just waiting for that answer,
for that yes or no.</i>

215
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:03,210
You're like, did I do enough?

216
00:09:03,206 --> 00:09:05,586
You know, do you really
feel the way I feel about you?

217
00:09:07,482 --> 00:09:09,692
I feel so stressed.

218
00:09:09,689 --> 00:09:11,379
I don't want to be
the one

219
00:09:11,379 --> 00:09:14,279
who tells
who will leave the villa.

220
00:09:18,965 --> 00:09:20,475
This is so hard.

221
00:09:28,793 --> 00:09:32,173
Jimmy and Ryan both chose you
for their match.

222
00:09:33,275 --> 00:09:34,685
Who did you choose?

223
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:38,825
Can they both stay?
Please.

224
00:09:38,827 --> 00:09:40,207
[Jimmy]
Mamma, are you sad too?

225
00:09:40,206 --> 00:09:42,686
[Soyoung] Oh, she's crying.

226
00:09:42,689 --> 00:09:43,789
She's crying.

227
00:09:43,793 --> 00:09:45,213
Don't cry.

228
00:09:46,551 --> 00:09:47,791
[Ryan] All right.

229
00:09:47,793 --> 00:09:51,553
Like, Jesus, I am really close
to your moms, both of them.

230
00:09:51,551 --> 00:09:53,411
And I don't want you
to feel like

231
00:09:53,413 --> 00:09:55,523
I've been betraying
our friendship

232
00:09:55,517 --> 00:09:56,657
because I'm not.

233
00:09:56,655 --> 00:09:59,855
- No, no.
- So, Ryan, I chose you.

234
00:09:59,862 --> 00:10:01,032
[cheering]

235
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:07,213
[Shannan] <i>I'm glad that Pola
had enough common sense</i>

236
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:08,716
<i>to make the right choice.</i>

237
00:10:08,724 --> 00:10:10,904
[Ryan]
<i>I do see a future with her.</i>

238
00:10:10,896 --> 00:10:13,206
I think the patience,
time and energy

239
00:10:13,206 --> 00:10:16,996
that we put into
each other is paying off.

240
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,830
Pola allows me
to be my true self.

241
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:20,517
[Ryan speaking]

242
00:10:20,517 --> 00:10:21,377
Yeah.

243
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:30,659
[Pola] Sorry.

244
00:10:30,655 --> 00:10:32,205
[Jimmy] Don't be sorry.

245
00:10:32,206 --> 00:10:33,586
[Pola] <i>It really hurt me</i>

246
00:10:33,586 --> 00:10:36,206
<i>saying to Jimmy
that I chose Ryan.</i>

247
00:10:36,206 --> 00:10:39,926
I really enjoyed his company
and it was really painful.

248
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:42,931
<i>But I chose Ryan
because of the last date.</i>

249
00:10:42,931 --> 00:10:46,141
<i>It was so special about
the painting and the song.</i>

250
00:10:48,172 --> 00:10:49,972
[phone vibrates]

251
00:10:49,965 --> 00:10:51,335
[sighs]

252
00:10:51,344 --> 00:10:54,934
Charlene,
you chose Ryan as...

253
00:10:55,413 --> 00:10:57,243
as your match,

254
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:58,931
but he did not choose you.

255
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:06,690
<i>I'm a little bummed that
I didn't get a real connection</i>

256
00:11:06,689 --> 00:11:08,549
<i>with anybody here in La Paz.</i>

257
00:11:08,551 --> 00:11:10,211
<i>Maybe I'm a little pushy</i>

258
00:11:10,206 --> 00:11:12,276
<i>and a little intense
for the guys.</i>

259
00:11:12,275 --> 00:11:13,445
I don't know.

260
00:11:13,448 --> 00:11:16,408
I didn't expect a home run,
but I was hoping to make

261
00:11:16,413 --> 00:11:17,933
a couple of base hits here.

262
00:11:17,931 --> 00:11:21,621
Since you and Ryan S
did not make a match,

263
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,690
you will be leaving the villa.

264
00:11:23,689 --> 00:11:25,029
[woman] I'm sorry.

265
00:11:25,034 --> 00:11:26,934
[Harrison]
<i>I considered putting
in Charlene,</i>

266
00:11:26,931 --> 00:11:29,791
but I don't see much of
a romantic connection there.

267
00:11:31,241 --> 00:11:33,381
- [phone vibrates]
- [bleep] I got a text.

268
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:34,899
[women] Okay.

269
00:11:37,103 --> 00:11:38,763
Congratulations.

270
00:11:38,758 --> 00:11:40,688
You and April
chose each other.

271
00:11:40,689 --> 00:11:42,209
Oh!

272
00:11:42,206 --> 00:11:45,686
You are both staying to
explore your connections.

273
00:11:45,689 --> 00:11:47,029
[indistinct]

274
00:11:47,034 --> 00:11:48,314
[April] Joey.

275
00:11:49,586 --> 00:11:51,476
- I'm keeping my eye on you.
- I know. I know.

276
00:11:52,896 --> 00:11:54,716
[cheering]

277
00:11:57,448 --> 00:11:59,028
Whoa!

278
00:11:59,034 --> 00:12:00,484
You scared me.

279
00:12:01,827 --> 00:12:03,687
[Joey]
<i>I'm just very happy that</i>

280
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:05,309
I picked her
and she picked me.

281
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:06,830
We get to stay.

282
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:08,687
I more than approve.

283
00:12:08,689 --> 00:12:10,969
[Gabriel]
<i>I feel like it's alarming.</i>

284
00:12:10,965 --> 00:12:12,095
And I'm annoyed right now

285
00:12:12,103 --> 00:12:13,343
because I don't
really want my mom

286
00:12:13,344 --> 00:12:15,864
dating a little kid
because she's, like,

287
00:12:15,862 --> 00:12:18,032
such a smart,
experienced woman.

288
00:12:18,034 --> 00:12:20,934
<i>And I just feel like,
can a kid really suffice?</i>

289
00:12:20,931 --> 00:12:22,341
Like her needs?

290
00:12:22,344 --> 00:12:23,554
I don't know.

291
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,620
[phone vibrates]

292
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,900
I have a text.

293
00:12:32,862 --> 00:12:34,172
Jose,

294
00:12:35,551 --> 00:12:37,691
Kelle, Soyoung and Shannan,

295
00:12:39,344 --> 00:12:41,004
all chose you for their match.

296
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,900
Kelle, Soyoung and Shannan,
who do you choose?

297
00:12:48,379 --> 00:12:52,449
Jose is the heartthrob
of the villa.

298
00:12:52,448 --> 00:12:53,788
<i>He's beautiful to look at.</i>

299
00:12:53,793 --> 00:12:55,103
He's amazing.

300
00:12:55,103 --> 00:12:56,833
You know,
he has a great personality.

301
00:12:56,827 --> 00:13:00,517
<i>For me, Jose is my number
one pick, my only pick.</i>

302
00:13:01,758 --> 00:13:03,998
<i>I feel that I am falling
for Jose</i>

303
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,720
and he's exactly
what I'm looking for.

304
00:13:05,724 --> 00:13:09,344
So mature
and romantic and loving.

305
00:13:09,344 --> 00:13:10,934
<i>Though I'm feeling
very confident,</i>

306
00:13:10,931 --> 00:13:12,621
<i>I'm not really sure
where his head's at.</i>

307
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,070
I just want to hear my name,
that's all.

308
00:13:16,241 --> 00:13:17,341
[Soyoung] <i>Here we are.</i>

309
00:13:17,344 --> 00:13:22,214
And three women
and it was unexpected.

310
00:13:22,206 --> 00:13:24,586
I'm hoping that
I have a little chance.

311
00:13:25,275 --> 00:13:28,025
The woman that I chose...

312
00:13:35,344 --> 00:13:36,454
is Kelle.

313
00:13:37,551 --> 00:13:38,931
[woman] Oh, Kelle.

314
00:13:41,068 --> 00:13:42,208
Thank you.

315
00:13:42,206 --> 00:13:45,756
I am so excited
that Jose picked me.

316
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,758
[Joey] <i>I knew that he would
make the right choice</i>

317
00:13:47,758 --> 00:13:48,998
<i>in the back of my mind.</i>

318
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,240
<i>But if he made
a out of pocket wrong choice,</i>

319
00:13:53,241 --> 00:13:55,691
then me and Jose
wouldn't have been cool.

320
00:13:55,689 --> 00:13:57,169
But he made the right choice.

321
00:13:57,172 --> 00:13:58,412
So we're cool.

322
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:01,995
[Shannan] It's all good.

323
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:04,405
No worries.

324
00:14:04,413 --> 00:14:06,523
<i>I don't want to cry.</i>

325
00:14:06,517 --> 00:14:09,587
<i>I feel like I have been
sucker punched.</i>

326
00:14:09,586 --> 00:14:11,476
<i>Someone has hit me
with a truck.</i>

327
00:14:11,482 --> 00:14:13,242
<i>But it's okay.</i>

328
00:14:13,241 --> 00:14:15,411
I'm gonna always roll with.

329
00:14:15,413 --> 00:14:18,483
That might be for now,
but it won't be for always.

330
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,860

331
00:14:24,275 --> 00:14:26,715
[Soyoung] <i>I'm very sad.</i>

332
00:14:26,724 --> 00:14:28,794
Actually,
I'm upset with Jose

333
00:14:28,793 --> 00:14:32,343
because I feel like
he betrayed me.

334
00:14:32,344 --> 00:14:33,484
That really hurt me.

335
00:14:33,482 --> 00:14:34,622
[Jimmy] Um-hmm.

336
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,140
Like,
I didn't expect that at all.

337
00:14:38,517 --> 00:14:41,097
[Jose] <i>Seeing Soyoung
and Shannan leave,</i>

338
00:14:41,103 --> 00:14:42,623
<i>it really breaks my heart.</i>

339
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,480
Especially knowing that
it was because of me.

340
00:14:47,517 --> 00:14:49,137
I... I didn't think it was
gonna happen this way.

341
00:14:49,137 --> 00:14:50,477
I know. I know, right.

342
00:14:50,482 --> 00:14:52,932
[Pola] <i>I really cannot believe
Jose choose Kelle</i>

343
00:14:52,931 --> 00:14:54,281
<i>and I'm not happy with that.</i>

00:14:54,275 --> 00:14:55,965
I don't see them
together outside the villa.

[phone vibrates]

346
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,380
[Ryan] I got a text.

347
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:06,383
Ryan S, Billy,

348
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,411
Jimmy,

00:15:10,931 --> 00:15:12,381
Soyoung,

350
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:15,339
Lisa, Shannan

351
00:15:15,344 --> 00:15:16,524
and Charlene.

352
00:15:17,655 --> 00:15:19,235
Unfortunately,

353
00:15:19,241 --> 00:15:21,031
you did not make
a connection.

354
00:15:23,793 --> 00:15:28,453
It's time to pack your bags
and say your goodbyes.

355
00:15:28,448 --> 00:15:29,928
Oh!

356
00:15:31,172 --> 00:15:32,972
[women] Oh, yes!

357
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:34,235
Yes. Yes. Yes.

358
00:15:44,172 --> 00:15:46,622
[Stefany] Oh, no, Billy.

359
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,860
Yeah.

360
00:15:47,862 --> 00:15:49,762
[Billy] <i>Although
I'm leaving the villa,</i>

361
00:15:49,758 --> 00:15:52,408
I'm stoked for my mom
and Gabriel.

362
00:15:52,413 --> 00:15:55,903
I think they could definitely
have a future with each other.

363
00:15:55,896 --> 00:15:57,336
- See you at home.
- All right.

364
00:15:57,344 --> 00:15:59,074
- See you soon.
- [indistinct]

365
00:15:59,068 --> 00:16:00,308
I'll see you later.

366
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:01,590
Hopefully the next time
I see her,

367
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:02,966
she might be in love.

368
00:16:02,965 --> 00:16:04,205
Thank you. Yeah.

369
00:16:04,206 --> 00:16:05,656
We'll see.

370
00:16:05,655 --> 00:16:07,585
- Take care.
- Bye. Bye, Kelle.

371
00:16:07,586 --> 00:16:09,026
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

372
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:11,904
I'm a little bummed
that Billy is leaving here

373
00:16:11,896 --> 00:16:14,136
without finding love.

374
00:16:14,137 --> 00:16:15,377
I'm definitely
gonna miss him.

375
00:16:15,379 --> 00:16:16,309
Bye.

376
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,280
[Pola speaking
in foreign language]

377
00:16:18,275 --> 00:16:21,515
Although I didn't match
with anyone,

378
00:16:21,517 --> 00:16:22,757
<i>I've learned a lot.</i>

379
00:16:22,758 --> 00:16:24,378
<i>I've learned to come out
of my shell,</i>

380
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:25,719
and I'm leaving happy.

381
00:16:25,724 --> 00:16:27,554
- [Jose] Bye, Billy.
- [Pola] Good bye.

382
00:16:28,896 --> 00:16:30,476
I will miss Pola, though.

383
00:16:30,482 --> 00:16:31,862
Yeah, she's incredible.

384
00:16:31,862 --> 00:16:33,142
[Soyoung] Mm-hmm.

385
00:16:33,137 --> 00:16:34,547
I don't have a regret.

386
00:16:34,551 --> 00:16:36,721
I will do
it a little differently.

387
00:16:37,344 --> 00:16:39,594
Jose, last minute.

388
00:16:41,758 --> 00:16:43,928
[Jimmy] Nothing I would have
done differently from day one,

389
00:16:43,931 --> 00:16:46,101
and was truly myself.

390
00:16:46,103 --> 00:16:47,763
- It's been a great experience.
- Oh, man.

391
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:50,308
I think I would have just go
for the Jose

392
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,970
right away
and show my emotions.

393
00:16:52,965 --> 00:16:54,135
I want you to find...

394
00:16:54,137 --> 00:16:56,687
No, I mean,
we always want to find

395
00:16:56,689 --> 00:16:58,099
a love, the true love.

396
00:16:58,103 --> 00:16:59,793
But I hope you find it soon.

397
00:16:59,793 --> 00:17:01,663
- Love you.
- [women] Bye!

398
00:17:01,655 --> 00:17:02,855
Bye, bye.

399
00:17:02,862 --> 00:17:04,662
<i>I came looking for love,
which I found.</i>

400
00:17:04,655 --> 00:17:06,165
You know,
I fell in love within my mom

401
00:17:06,172 --> 00:17:07,762
and love within
all of these people

402
00:17:07,758 --> 00:17:09,028
and friends that I made.

403
00:17:11,413 --> 00:17:13,523
[Pola] What a gorgeous
woman, always.

404
00:17:13,517 --> 00:17:14,927
- Looking...
- Thank you.

405
00:17:14,931 --> 00:17:16,381
[indistinct]

406
00:17:18,068 --> 00:17:19,618
Ryan and I have
always been close.

407
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,100
He's my firstborn,

408
00:17:21,103 --> 00:17:24,003
<i>but I would say
this experience with him</i>

409
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,520
has definitely taken
our relationship
to another level.

410
00:17:26,517 --> 00:17:27,757
Let me know
if you need something.

411
00:17:27,758 --> 00:17:28,928
I got you.
I'm gonna check on you.

412
00:17:28,931 --> 00:17:30,171
- All right?
- I'm very proud of you.

413
00:17:30,172 --> 00:17:31,382
Love you.

414
00:17:31,379 --> 00:17:32,659
- Oh.
- You're still my baby.

415
00:17:32,655 --> 00:17:35,515
But, but, you know,
I respect you as a young man.

416
00:17:35,517 --> 00:17:36,827
Exactly.

417
00:17:36,827 --> 00:17:38,547
And I... I think
we've become better friends,
and that's...

418
00:17:38,551 --> 00:17:39,971
- Yeah.
- ...thus be it.

419
00:17:44,724 --> 00:17:46,524
[Charlene] This is a once
in a lifetime, right?

420
00:17:46,517 --> 00:17:48,927
- [Kelle] That's right.
- We'll always have La Paz.

421
00:17:48,931 --> 00:17:50,691
- Aren't you glad you did it?
- Yes.

422
00:17:50,689 --> 00:17:51,789
- [Pola] Me too.
- Yes.

423
00:17:51,793 --> 00:17:53,003
- Big group hug.
- Yeah.

424
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,790
- [Pola] Give me a hug.
- Big group hug.

425
00:17:54,793 --> 00:17:56,763
- [Kelle] I love you.
- [Charlene] I love you.

426
00:17:56,758 --> 00:17:58,278
Thank you.

427
00:17:58,275 --> 00:17:59,515
[woman]
Give Harrison our love.

428
00:17:59,517 --> 00:18:00,997
- [Charlene] Yeah.
- [Pola] They're family.

429
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,210
[Charlene]
<i>I came here to find love,</i>

430
00:18:03,206 --> 00:18:06,586
but I found more love
for myself.

431
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,206
- [Stefany] Bye, Charlene.
- Bye.

432
00:18:08,206 --> 00:18:09,926
Thank you, guys.

433
00:18:09,931 --> 00:18:11,451
Have fun.

434
00:18:12,862 --> 00:18:16,592
And I've learned that
love can grow

435
00:18:16,586 --> 00:18:18,066
anywhere you will allow it.

436
00:18:18,068 --> 00:18:20,928
And especially if you open
yourself up to new ideas.

437
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,380
Down to us.

438
00:18:23,379 --> 00:18:24,899
Yeah, that's everyone.

439
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,240
Oh, my Lord.

440
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:30,861
- Come here, baby doll.
- What are you doing?

441
00:18:30,862 --> 00:18:32,522
- How are you?
- [man speaking]

442
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:35,032
Wow.

443
00:18:35,034 --> 00:18:36,284
- [Kelle speaking]
- [man speaking]

444
00:18:36,275 --> 00:18:38,065
What's happening?

445
00:18:38,068 --> 00:18:39,998
Is this guy actually serious?

446
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,380
[man speaking]

447
00:18:59,551 --> 00:19:01,101
- Beachy girl look...
- Yeah.

448
00:19:01,103 --> 00:19:02,623
...with her cowboy boots on.

449
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,100
I like it.
Beach reminded me of Mexico.

450
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:09,694
[Jose] This is a nice place,
nice spot.

451
00:19:09,689 --> 00:19:10,929
Yeah.

452
00:19:10,931 --> 00:19:13,171
Gonna have a nice lunch.

453
00:19:14,448 --> 00:19:15,928
[Joey]
<i>It feels a little bit weird</i>

454
00:19:15,931 --> 00:19:19,171
now that half
the house is gone.

455
00:19:19,172 --> 00:19:22,172
So it's going to take
some getting used to.

456
00:19:22,172 --> 00:19:23,722
I'm glad.

457
00:19:23,724 --> 00:19:25,344
- You're glad?
- Yeah.

458
00:19:25,344 --> 00:19:26,864
<i>I'm glad that the people
are gone,</i>

459
00:19:26,862 --> 00:19:29,242
so I can really get to know
Jose more

460
00:19:29,241 --> 00:19:31,901
and connect one on one
without all these distractions.

461
00:19:31,896 --> 00:19:34,236
I mean,
this is what I came here for.

462
00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:37,451
- Yeah.
- And so, you know.

463
00:19:38,689 --> 00:19:40,209
- Yeah.
- Quite.

464
00:19:41,206 --> 00:19:43,096
<i>Salud,</i> for sure.

465
00:19:43,103 --> 00:19:44,243
[phone vibrates]

466
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,480
I got a text.

467
00:19:46,482 --> 00:19:47,902
Woo! Okay.

468
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:49,206
What does it say?

469
00:19:49,206 --> 00:19:54,236
It says, what happens
at the villa,
stay at the villa?

470
00:19:55,413 --> 00:19:56,903
Yeah. What does that mean?

471
00:19:56,896 --> 00:20:00,896
Couples, it's time
to take your connection

472
00:20:00,896 --> 00:20:02,856
into the real world.

473
00:20:02,862 --> 00:20:06,482
A close friend
or family member
will meet you here.

474
00:20:06,482 --> 00:20:08,032
What?

475
00:20:08,034 --> 00:20:10,594
Let's see what your friends
and family have to say

476
00:20:10,586 --> 00:20:12,236
about your new relationship.

477
00:20:12,241 --> 00:20:13,311
Good luck.

478
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,520
Oh!

479
00:20:14,517 --> 00:20:15,757
Oh, no.

480
00:20:15,758 --> 00:20:18,238
I've no idea who's coming.

481
00:20:18,241 --> 00:20:19,311
Do you?

482
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,790
Oh, no.

483
00:20:20,793 --> 00:20:23,033
I thought we were gonna
stay like this forever
in our own little...

484
00:20:23,034 --> 00:20:25,934
I know, in our own
little La Paz bubble.

485
00:20:25,931 --> 00:20:27,281
I like it like that.

486
00:20:27,275 --> 00:20:30,335
I wonder if for us
to continue together,

487
00:20:30,344 --> 00:20:31,764
if they have to approve.

488
00:20:31,758 --> 00:20:33,068
I wonder.

489
00:20:33,068 --> 00:20:34,168
[Ryan] <i>I'm kind of anxious.</i>

490
00:20:34,172 --> 00:20:35,592
<i>I'm anxious to see
who's coming.</i>

491
00:20:35,586 --> 00:20:37,546
I am hoping that
it's not her ex-husband.

492
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:39,033
[chuckles]

493
00:20:40,137 --> 00:20:41,337
Okay.

494
00:20:41,344 --> 00:20:44,594
So I'm thinking it might be
your, like, best friend

495
00:20:44,586 --> 00:20:47,236
or it might be, I don't know.

496
00:20:47,241 --> 00:20:48,381
Maybe your mom.

497
00:20:48,379 --> 00:20:50,409
Maybe Billy's aunt.

498
00:20:50,413 --> 00:20:51,833
I have no clue.

499
00:20:51,827 --> 00:20:53,167
[Stefany]
<i>A visitor is coming.</i>

500
00:20:53,172 --> 00:20:55,172
<i>I have no idea who it is.</i>

501
00:20:55,172 --> 00:20:58,452
I'm just a little worried
that if this person comes

502
00:20:58,448 --> 00:21:01,928
and meets Gabriel
that they might
not approve of it.

503
00:21:01,931 --> 00:21:03,341
<i>He's a rock star.</i>

504
00:21:03,344 --> 00:21:05,974
<i>They probably think
he's not gonna
take me serious.</i>

505
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:07,585
<i>So I'm a little nervous.</i>

506
00:21:07,586 --> 00:21:11,516
I am hoping
it is not any of my exes.

507
00:21:11,517 --> 00:21:14,827
I don't think my exes
would approve of me

508
00:21:14,827 --> 00:21:17,477
dating anyone younger.

509
00:21:17,482 --> 00:21:19,592
Do you have any idea
who it might be?

510
00:21:19,586 --> 00:21:21,066
I hope it's McKenna.

511
00:21:21,068 --> 00:21:22,278
Your daughter?

512
00:21:22,827 --> 00:21:24,067
That would be amazing.

513
00:21:24,068 --> 00:21:25,308
It will be such a pleasure meeting.

514
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,520
Yeah.

515
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,280
I'm like shaking.

516
00:21:29,275 --> 00:21:33,925
McKenna is my oldest daughter
of six beautiful kids, and...

517
00:21:33,931 --> 00:21:35,071
Yeah.

518
00:21:35,068 --> 00:21:36,548
McKenna is definitely
my bestie.

519
00:21:36,551 --> 00:21:37,971
Yeah.

520
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:40,855
Oh, my God.

521
00:21:42,827 --> 00:21:44,657
<i>That's my sister.</i>

522
00:21:46,275 --> 00:21:49,995
My sister McKenna,
a.k.a. Disco Bunny.

523
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,170
Her nickname
that she likes to go by

524
00:21:52,172 --> 00:21:56,242
<i>because she choose that,
she likes to dance
and she's really energetic.</i>

525
00:21:56,241 --> 00:21:59,761
<i>My mom, Disco Bunny
and Disco Mommy are like,</i>

526
00:21:59,758 --> 00:22:01,588
<i>exactly the same.</i>

527
00:22:02,551 --> 00:22:04,661
<i>They're like printouts
of each other.</i>

528
00:22:09,103 --> 00:22:10,523
Is this seat taken?

529
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,590
[screams]

530
00:22:17,862 --> 00:22:19,212
Hi, Joey.

531
00:22:19,206 --> 00:22:20,656
Hi, McKenna.

532
00:22:21,551 --> 00:22:23,171
I know, I know, I know.

533
00:22:23,172 --> 00:22:27,692
I think it's a very big deal
that Jose and my sister
get along,

534
00:22:27,689 --> 00:22:31,069
because if they don't,
I mean, my sister
is so close to my mom

535
00:22:31,068 --> 00:22:35,028
that I think she would
kind of drive him out.

536
00:22:35,034 --> 00:22:37,664
If McKenna doesn't
like Jose, he out.

537
00:22:37,655 --> 00:22:39,475
- Bye.
- Yeah.

538
00:22:39,482 --> 00:22:41,212
- All right.
- Yeah, I know.

539
00:22:41,206 --> 00:22:42,786
I always listen to my kids.

540
00:22:42,793 --> 00:22:44,073
They're smarter than me.

541
00:22:44,068 --> 00:22:45,718
- Meet my little friend.
- You must be McKenna.

542
00:22:45,724 --> 00:22:47,074
- Yeah.
- [Kelle] Meet my
little friend.

543
00:22:47,068 --> 00:22:48,168
How are you?

544
00:22:48,172 --> 00:22:50,242
- Come here.
- Pleased to meet you.

545
00:22:51,689 --> 00:22:54,029
Oh, yeah!

546
00:22:54,034 --> 00:22:55,484
No.

547
00:22:55,482 --> 00:22:57,342
Oh, my God.

548
00:22:57,344 --> 00:22:59,524
I'm so happy.
You're gonna make me cry.

549
00:22:59,931 --> 00:23:01,591
I love her.

550
00:23:03,551 --> 00:23:05,931
I'm so happy you came.

551
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,030
<i>Peace is a friend.
We talk all the time.</i>

552
00:23:10,034 --> 00:23:13,314
She has always been there
for me during hard times.

553
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:17,000
<i>She is someone that I call
to kind of just ask her</i>

554
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,280
<i>to give me tips or give me
a little bit of advice</i>

555
00:23:20,275 --> 00:23:22,405
on the guy that I'm dating.

556
00:23:22,413 --> 00:23:25,763
<i>She's been a support system
in my dating life.</i>

557
00:23:25,758 --> 00:23:27,028
I love her dearly.

558
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:29,281
Oh, my God.

559
00:23:29,275 --> 00:23:30,445
<i>Voila!</i>

560
00:23:30,448 --> 00:23:32,758
[Pola speaking

561
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:41,550
[Emma speaking
in foreign language]

562
00:23:41,551 --> 00:23:46,281
[Pola] <i>This amazing
sunshine up here,
it's my daughter, Emma.</i>

563
00:23:46,275 --> 00:23:48,475
<i>I'm so happy
that she's here.</i>

564
00:23:48,482 --> 00:23:51,722
<i>For me, the most
important part
of having a partner</i>

565
00:23:51,724 --> 00:23:53,624
is meeting my kids.

566
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:57,380
<i>I usually never introduce
my man to my family</i>

567
00:23:57,379 --> 00:24:00,069
<i>unless I feel there's future.</i>

568
00:24:00,068 --> 00:24:06,338
My only concern about
Ryan and Emma meeting
is about Emma liking Ryan.

569
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:08,284
She is not easy.

570
00:24:08,275 --> 00:24:09,445
Your name is Ryan?

571
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,518
Yes.

572
00:24:10,517 --> 00:24:11,897
So who are you, Ryan?

573
00:24:15,965 --> 00:24:17,275
Someone's coming.

574
00:24:17,275 --> 00:24:18,615
- Somebody is coming?
- Huh.

575
00:24:23,551 --> 00:24:25,211
Oh, my Lord.

576
00:24:25,206 --> 00:24:26,756
- Come here, baby doll.
- What are you doing?

577
00:24:26,758 --> 00:24:27,828
How are you?

578
00:24:27,827 --> 00:24:31,097
[Billy]
I love you so much.

579
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,340
Love you too.

580
00:24:34,344 --> 00:24:35,664
- Hey, I'm Billy.
- I'm Joey.

581
00:24:35,655 --> 00:24:37,615
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

582
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:42,310
Billy Jayne is my ex-husband
and Gabriel's father.

583
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:47,380
<i>I met Billy doing a movie
with him, and I was engaged
at the time,</i>

584
00:24:47,379 --> 00:24:49,689
and he walked
into my dressing room

585
00:24:49,689 --> 00:24:51,859
and took my engagement
ring off.

586
00:24:53,517 --> 00:24:56,617
So that's what he thinks
about other men with me.

587
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,620
How are you doing?
You good?

588
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,930
[Billy] Yeah.

589
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:05,171
I was with Billy for 17 years,
and we were married for nine.

590
00:25:05,172 --> 00:25:08,412
We divorced around 2003.

591
00:25:08,413 --> 00:25:09,553
Come.

592
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:10,661
Where?

593
00:25:10,655 --> 00:25:11,925
Home.

594
00:25:11,931 --> 00:25:13,381
- I'm not going.
- All right.

595
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:14,689
I'm not going home right now.

596
00:25:14,689 --> 00:25:16,689
We're growing
in different directions

597
00:25:16,689 --> 00:25:21,279
and I just wanted to explore
some time
being on my own as a woman.

598
00:25:21,275 --> 00:25:22,375
Enough. Come on.

599
00:25:22,379 --> 00:25:23,859
Oh, my God.

600
00:25:24,413 --> 00:25:25,523
Wow.

601
00:25:25,517 --> 00:25:27,027
- [Billy speaking]
- What's happening?

602
00:25:27,034 --> 00:25:29,034
- [Billy speaking]
- I'm supposed to be on...

603
00:25:29,034 --> 00:25:30,724
Ah!

604
00:25:30,724 --> 00:25:33,214
Is this guy actually serious?

605
00:25:33,206 --> 00:25:34,336
Like, is this...

606
00:25:34,344 --> 00:25:35,904
am I being pranked right now?

607
00:25:35,896 --> 00:25:37,826
I thought it was like,
all a joke.

608
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:39,067
[Billy speaking]

609
00:25:39,896 --> 00:25:41,166
- [April] Oh, okay.
- [Billy speaking]

610
00:25:46,241 --> 00:25:47,381
What are you trying
to prove, bro?

611
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,589
It's just rude,
immature behavior.

612
00:25:51,379 --> 00:25:53,549
My whole crotch is showing.

613
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:56,411
[Jose]
<i>It's so ungentleman like.</i>

614
00:25:56,413 --> 00:25:58,553
It's something
that you just don't do.

615
00:26:01,482 --> 00:26:02,662
Do you have children?

616
00:26:02,655 --> 00:26:04,095
- No.
- Do you want children?

617
00:26:04,103 --> 00:26:05,763
Um, one day.

618
00:26:05,758 --> 00:26:07,308
Because my mom
doesn't want
any more children.

619
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,760
You know, the throw me
against the wall,

620
00:26:10,758 --> 00:26:13,478
make out with me
anywhere connection.

621
00:26:13,482 --> 00:26:16,662
If I asked you to go
on a date with me, would you?

622
00:26:26,655 --> 00:26:28,235
- [Billy speaking]
- [April speaking]

623
00:26:28,241 --> 00:26:29,451
[Billy speaking]

624
00:26:34,034 --> 00:26:35,244
Don't be fun.

625
00:26:35,241 --> 00:26:37,001
[Billy speaking]

626
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,280
I've been divorced
from Billy for a long time,

627
00:26:39,275 --> 00:26:42,235
<i>but there's definitely
still love
between Billy and I.</i>

628
00:26:42,241 --> 00:26:46,521
So, you know, he's gonna
make his move here and there,

629
00:26:46,517 --> 00:26:48,657
and I'm going with it.

630
00:26:48,655 --> 00:26:49,855
It's my ex-husband.

631
00:26:49,862 --> 00:26:51,792
You know, I go with the flow.

632
00:26:52,965 --> 00:26:54,275
Sit down.

633
00:26:56,068 --> 00:26:57,758
Billy, stay in your lane.

634
00:26:57,758 --> 00:26:58,898
That's my son.

635
00:26:58,896 --> 00:27:00,996
My friend...
[speaking foreign language]

636
00:27:01,689 --> 00:27:02,929
My friend.

637
00:27:02,931 --> 00:27:04,071
Wow.

638
00:27:04,068 --> 00:27:05,658
Oh, look how fast.

639
00:27:05,655 --> 00:27:08,515
Whenever I get
put in awkward situations,

640
00:27:08,517 --> 00:27:11,237
I tend to laugh
and smile

641
00:27:11,241 --> 00:27:12,621
because I don't
really know what to do.

642
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,310
Get mad, start punching them?

643
00:27:14,827 --> 00:27:16,167
No, it's all good.

644
00:27:16,172 --> 00:27:18,832
Obviously, I don't want
to show him, you know,

645
00:27:18,827 --> 00:27:20,517
that it pissed me off
a little bit

646
00:27:20,517 --> 00:27:23,717
because that's just gonna add
more fuel to the fire
with the person like that.

647
00:27:23,724 --> 00:27:24,794
What's your name?

648
00:27:24,793 --> 00:27:25,903
- Jo... Joey.
- Joey.

649
00:27:25,896 --> 00:27:27,336
- Joey. That's my middle name.
- Yeah.

650
00:27:27,344 --> 00:27:29,074
You're older. She knows
she's older than me.

651
00:27:29,068 --> 00:27:30,138
[April] And I'm older
than him.

652
00:27:30,137 --> 00:27:31,717
[Billy] I met her
when I was 17.

653
00:27:31,724 --> 00:27:32,834
I seduced you.

654
00:27:32,827 --> 00:27:36,337
Honestly,
Joey's handling things
at the table

655
00:27:36,344 --> 00:27:39,694
way better than I would be
because I would have
been calling his ass out.

656
00:27:39,689 --> 00:27:41,339
I would have told him
to leave the table

657
00:27:41,344 --> 00:27:43,594
and take his leather coat
with him.

658
00:27:43,586 --> 00:27:45,516
<i>My first impression is
he's dripping</i>

659
00:27:45,517 --> 00:27:47,617
- in toxic masculinity...
- There we go.

660
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:50,520
[Kelle] <i>...and he clearly
needs a lot of attention,</i>

661
00:27:50,517 --> 00:27:52,237
which is pretty embarrassing
at his age.

662
00:27:52,931 --> 00:27:54,141
Yeah, that's true.

663
00:27:55,344 --> 00:27:56,624
Sure you don't want
to bite of steak?

664
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,970
[Billy speaking]

665
00:28:01,482 --> 00:28:02,662
Stop!

666
00:28:03,655 --> 00:28:04,515
See what I mean?

667
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:08,000
That's why I have
three children with this man.

668
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,140
Twins.

669
00:28:09,137 --> 00:28:11,137
That's two sperm.
Two eggs, my friend.

670
00:28:14,379 --> 00:28:17,659
I mean, clearly,
we see the reason
why Billy is her ex,

671
00:28:17,655 --> 00:28:21,405
but on the other hand,
how can he keep master
manipulating her

672
00:28:21,413 --> 00:28:22,723
still after all these years?

673
00:28:22,724 --> 00:28:24,414
<i>The behavior
obviously is the same.</i>

674
00:28:24,413 --> 00:28:28,383
I don't know
why she would accept
his bad energy back when,

675
00:28:28,379 --> 00:28:29,549
you know,
preaching good energy.

676
00:28:29,551 --> 00:28:31,031
Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

677
00:28:31,034 --> 00:28:32,344
Ooh.

678
00:28:32,344 --> 00:28:33,554
What are you eating?

679
00:28:33,551 --> 00:28:35,311
Oh, oh, I'm eating the steak.

680
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,590
[April]
We're both having steak.

681
00:28:44,275 --> 00:28:47,855
I think that Billy
is just kind of focusing
on me,

682
00:28:47,862 --> 00:28:51,312
it seems like,
and he doesn't even notice
Joey there,

683
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:53,030
to be quite honest.

684
00:28:53,034 --> 00:28:57,524
But you know,
Billy's Billy and he's just
gonna do what he's gonna do.

685
00:28:57,517 --> 00:28:59,277
<i>I kind of feel bad for Joey</i>

686
00:28:59,275 --> 00:29:05,965
because, you know, we were
on a date and Billy just came
and changed the whole story.

687
00:29:05,965 --> 00:29:07,585
I want to ask you
some questions, though.

688
00:29:07,586 --> 00:29:08,716
- [Ryan] Okay.
- [Pola] Oh, yeah.

689
00:29:08,724 --> 00:29:09,864
- All right.
- I'm an open book.

690
00:29:09,862 --> 00:29:11,312
[Emma] Do you...
do you have children?

691
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,900
- [Ryan] No.
- Do you want children?

692
00:29:13,482 --> 00:29:15,412
Um, I mean, I'm...

693
00:29:16,896 --> 00:29:18,586
one day I'd be open to it.

694
00:29:18,586 --> 00:29:21,786
Yeah, because my mom
doesn't want
any more children.

695
00:29:24,689 --> 00:29:26,689
I mean, it's not necessarily
a deal breaker for me.

696
00:29:26,689 --> 00:29:27,899
[Pola] Really it's not.

697
00:29:27,896 --> 00:29:29,376
Not, it's not.

698
00:29:29,379 --> 00:29:33,099
Like, I just want to be
extremely happy and...

699
00:29:33,103 --> 00:29:34,663
I agree with you 100%.

700
00:29:34,655 --> 00:29:36,095
And I don't know
about the age.

701
00:29:36,103 --> 00:29:37,283
Um-hmm.

702
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:42,065
She has a very young, genuine,
given outgoing spirit

703
00:29:42,068 --> 00:29:44,138
and like, I'm extremely
attracted to that.

704
00:29:44,137 --> 00:29:45,787
Nice.

705
00:29:45,793 --> 00:29:50,103
[Pola] <i>Ryan tells me
every single day
that he loves Jose</i>

706
00:29:50,103 --> 00:29:53,073
and that he sees himself
with my family.

707
00:29:53,068 --> 00:29:57,788
<i>But I just need to get Jose
and Emma's approval.</i>

708
00:29:57,793 --> 00:30:03,173
For me family is and
will always be the most
important part of my life.

709
00:30:03,172 --> 00:30:07,032
I really need to know
how you feel about
me being with Ryan?

710
00:30:09,482 --> 00:30:12,282
Like you always told us,
like my brother and myself,

711
00:30:12,275 --> 00:30:16,305
that right now, like,
the most important people
are both of us.

712
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,660
Like my brother and myself.

713
00:30:17,655 --> 00:30:19,275
But right now,
we're all really grown up.

714
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:21,895
And I think your job is done,
completely done.

715
00:30:21,896 --> 00:30:23,206
And you did a terrific job.

716
00:30:23,206 --> 00:30:24,446
You did a very good job.

717
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:26,208
I think it's time
to focus on yourself.

718
00:30:26,206 --> 00:30:27,276
[Pola] Thank you.

719
00:30:27,275 --> 00:30:31,545
And I think like
whichever guy you choose,

720
00:30:31,551 --> 00:30:32,971
we're gonna be supportive.

721
00:30:32,965 --> 00:30:34,095
We're gonna be proud.

722
00:30:34,103 --> 00:30:36,903
And honestly, you need to...
you need to start living.

723
00:30:36,896 --> 00:30:38,026
[Pola] I agree.

724
00:30:38,034 --> 00:30:39,694
Thank you.

725
00:30:39,689 --> 00:30:43,209
[Ryan] <i>Emma's cosign
and approval is extremely
important to me at this point.</i>

726
00:30:43,206 --> 00:30:46,616
So based on how highly Pola
speaks of Emma,

727
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,930
<i>I have her blessing.</i>

728
00:30:47,931 --> 00:30:50,141
<i>It's 100% necessary.</i>

729
00:30:52,172 --> 00:30:53,412
What's going on? Like...

730
00:30:53,413 --> 00:30:54,903
- [Stefany] Oh, my God.
- I want to know.

731
00:30:54,896 --> 00:30:56,546
I'm excited. I want to know.
What's going on?

732
00:30:56,551 --> 00:31:01,971
I'm opening up to potentially
like, you know,
the fact that he's 23.

733
00:31:01,965 --> 00:31:04,445
I mean, he's made me
felt so special.

734
00:31:05,206 --> 00:31:06,926
But you've never
dated someone...

735
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:08,451
- [Stefany] Older.
- ...older before?

736
00:31:08,448 --> 00:31:10,098
- Never, right?
- Not to this extent.

737
00:31:10,103 --> 00:31:11,973
[Peace] Okay.
You too, right?

738
00:31:11,965 --> 00:31:13,205
[Stefany] Yeah, no.
I've never...

739
00:31:13,206 --> 00:31:15,096
- Because we've talked and...
- [Stefany] Yeah, I've... Yeah.

740
00:31:15,103 --> 00:31:17,973
No, she was never,
like, you're, like, no.

741
00:31:17,965 --> 00:31:19,615
- [Stefany] Not younger guys.
- That's too young.

742
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,410
So I'm like, just be open.

743
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:22,833
You never know.

744
00:31:22,827 --> 00:31:26,717
[Stefany] I mean,
he doesn't, you know,
I mean, you don't act 23.

745
00:31:27,655 --> 00:31:29,965
And Stefany,
you see this guy as the one

746
00:31:29,965 --> 00:31:32,895
or just get into the one
or what? What is it?

747
00:31:35,137 --> 00:31:37,857
That was a little bit
of an awkward question.

748
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:40,312
<i>You know, it was probably
even awkward for Gabriel.</i>

749
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:43,660
I've definitely not had
a chance to talk to Gabriel
about any of this.

750
00:31:43,655 --> 00:31:47,165
I'm not even sure if Gabriel,
you know, wants to be married.

751
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,380
- We'll see.
- We'll see?

752
00:31:49,379 --> 00:31:50,789
What God's plan is.

753
00:31:50,793 --> 00:31:52,793
Are you hesitant
or do you think...

754
00:31:52,793 --> 00:31:55,793
No. I think because
we've taken it so slow...

755
00:31:55,793 --> 00:31:56,933
[Peace] Okay.

756
00:31:56,931 --> 00:32:00,031
...and we've established
this amazing connection.

757
00:32:00,034 --> 00:32:03,144
[Gabriel]
What scares me is that, like,

758
00:32:03,137 --> 00:32:07,207
sometimes when you
establish something
so strong with someone,

759
00:32:07,206 --> 00:32:10,586
if you make it, it's just
such a romantic level.

760
00:32:10,586 --> 00:32:13,786
It could totally be ruined
in like six months.

761
00:32:13,793 --> 00:32:16,693
[Stefany] <i>This is definitely
reality check.</i>

762
00:32:16,689 --> 00:32:21,339
<i>You know, love's a risk
and I'm willing
to put it all out there.</i>

763
00:32:21,344 --> 00:32:24,004
But why would I
put myself all in

764
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,690
if, you know,
he's not willing to do so?

765
00:32:26,689 --> 00:32:30,279
It makes me question
if this is even
gonna go anywhere.

766
00:32:30,275 --> 00:32:31,585
Love takes time.

767
00:32:31,586 --> 00:32:34,276
I mean, you don't
have to rush,
but at the same time,

768
00:32:34,275 --> 00:32:35,715
you still have to know
what you want.

769
00:32:40,103 --> 00:32:41,553
They've heard
so much about you.

770
00:32:41,551 --> 00:32:42,691
Umm.

771
00:32:42,689 --> 00:32:43,929
I feel like I know you.

772
00:32:43,931 --> 00:32:45,031
Yeah.

773
00:32:45,034 --> 00:32:46,344
But I don't know
anything about you.

774
00:32:46,344 --> 00:32:48,834
[Jose] I know.
I know you don't.

775
00:32:48,827 --> 00:32:50,897
I have a tough question
for you.

776
00:32:50,896 --> 00:32:52,206
For who? For me?

777
00:32:52,206 --> 00:32:53,476
- [McKenna] Both of you.
- Okay.

778
00:32:53,482 --> 00:32:54,972
- Oh.
- Drum roll.

779
00:32:56,275 --> 00:32:58,205
How far has your intimacy
gone?

780
00:33:03,379 --> 00:33:04,589
[Kelle] Why are you
looking at me?

781
00:33:04,586 --> 00:33:05,856
You looked at me.

782
00:33:05,862 --> 00:33:07,762
Every time that subject comes
up, you just, like, clam up.

783
00:33:07,758 --> 00:33:09,828
I'm just looking at you
and, you.

784
00:33:09,827 --> 00:33:11,277
Oh, just come out...

785
00:33:11,275 --> 00:33:12,585
You're looking at both of us.

786
00:33:12,586 --> 00:33:14,336
I'm looking we got stuck
in together.

787
00:33:14,344 --> 00:33:15,934
What are you,
getting nervous?

788
00:33:15,931 --> 00:33:17,101
I'm not.

789
00:33:17,103 --> 00:33:18,623
There's nothing to be
nervous about.

790
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,930
Hmm.

791
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:22,661
I mean,
I think it's the same thing
as we've been doing.

792
00:33:22,655 --> 00:33:24,135
We're taking it slow.

793
00:33:24,137 --> 00:33:26,897
<i>McKenna is definitely someone
with a very strong personality,</i>

794
00:33:26,896 --> 00:33:30,996
and it's someone
that I in a way,

795
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,280
I'm gonna have a challenge
in to earning her acceptance.

796
00:33:35,275 --> 00:33:37,235
So how do you feel
about her having six kids?

797
00:33:37,241 --> 00:33:38,791
I... it's amazing.

798
00:33:38,793 --> 00:33:39,933
- [McKenna] Yeah.
- Yeah.

799
00:33:39,931 --> 00:33:41,071
Good answer.

800
00:33:41,862 --> 00:33:42,972
Do you want kids?

801
00:33:43,758 --> 00:33:44,998
Mm-hmm.

802
00:33:45,413 --> 00:33:46,343
Yeah.

803
00:33:47,517 --> 00:33:50,167
I love the fact
that McKenna is grilling Jose

804
00:33:50,172 --> 00:33:53,242
because she's asking him
all the questions
I actually wanted to know.

805
00:33:53,241 --> 00:33:54,931
<i>McKenna can read anybody.</i>

806
00:33:54,931 --> 00:33:57,411
So if Jose is, like,
playing a game,

807
00:33:57,413 --> 00:33:59,283
she's definitely gonna
sniff it out.

808
00:33:59,275 --> 00:34:00,615
I still want
to get to know you

809
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:03,830
because she's extremely
special to me.

810
00:34:03,827 --> 00:34:07,617
The most amazing soul ever.

811
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,000
[Jose] For sure.

812
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,380
And, you know,
I'm really protective,
but I'm happy to be here.

813
00:34:12,379 --> 00:34:13,589
For sure.

814
00:34:13,586 --> 00:34:14,896
Yeah, I'm happy you're here.

815
00:34:14,896 --> 00:34:16,166
I'm happy to meet you.

816
00:34:16,172 --> 00:34:18,032
Yeah, thank you.
Thank you.

817
00:34:18,034 --> 00:34:20,594
So after having
this conversation with Jose,

818
00:34:20,586 --> 00:34:23,236
I definitely want
to put him through
a little bit of a test.

819
00:34:23,241 --> 00:34:26,341
<i>I do have some reservations,
but we'll see.</i>

820
00:34:29,896 --> 00:34:31,206
You're very cute.

821
00:34:31,206 --> 00:34:32,516
I'm blushing.

822
00:34:32,517 --> 00:34:34,027
Don't blush.

823
00:34:34,034 --> 00:34:35,554
So...

824
00:34:35,551 --> 00:34:37,761
[Emma speaking]

825
00:34:40,862 --> 00:34:44,832
Emma showing up
definitely changes the game.

826
00:34:44,827 --> 00:34:47,337
Starting to wonder,
if April
is the right one for me.

827
00:34:52,275 --> 00:34:53,585
[Jose] <i>How are you
feeling, buddy?</i>

828
00:34:53,586 --> 00:34:56,026
I'm still thinking about
what happened
in the restaurant, bro.

829
00:34:56,034 --> 00:34:57,524
I was furious.

830
00:34:57,517 --> 00:34:58,617
Yeah.

831
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:01,970
- In the future,
that must not happen.
- Yeah.

832
00:35:01,965 --> 00:35:05,755
Billy, he was trying to,
like, set a boundary that,

833
00:35:05,758 --> 00:35:07,308
like, wasn't really...

834
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:09,860
- He was trying to show off...
- [Joey] Yeah.

835
00:35:09,862 --> 00:35:12,482
...and get attention,
and you were making her happy.

836
00:35:12,482 --> 00:35:14,312
- And he is not.
- I know.

837
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:17,480
So you should be very proud
of who you are

838
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:19,412
and take that wherever you go.

839
00:35:19,413 --> 00:35:20,623
Yeah. And I will.

840
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,030
[McKenna] Hello, darlings.

841
00:35:22,034 --> 00:35:23,144
Hello, darling.

842
00:35:23,137 --> 00:35:24,657
- How are you?
- McKenna, how are you doing?

843
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:27,965
- How are you?
- Good. But I do want
to steal you.

844
00:35:27,965 --> 00:35:29,025
- You want to steal me?
- Yeah.

845
00:35:29,034 --> 00:35:30,174
Okay.

846
00:35:30,172 --> 00:35:32,972
I definitely want to take time
in to talk to Jose

847
00:35:32,965 --> 00:35:34,615
because I don't know him.

848
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:38,380
So there is some digging
I need to do for sure.

849
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:40,380
Thank you.

850
00:35:40,379 --> 00:35:41,689
[Jose] You're welcome, McKenna.

851
00:35:41,689 --> 00:35:42,999
- [McKenna] Ooh.
- [Jose] Be careful.

852
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,380
- [McKenna] Will I
break this?
- No, no, it's been delicate.

853
00:35:45,379 --> 00:35:46,859
It's been delicate for...

854
00:35:46,862 --> 00:35:47,972
I don't know.

855
00:35:47,965 --> 00:35:49,335
I work out pretty hard.

856
00:35:49,344 --> 00:35:50,414
[Jose] That's cool.

857
00:35:50,413 --> 00:35:52,693
So with my mom,

858
00:35:52,689 --> 00:35:57,099
when was the moment
where you wanted
to choose her like?

859
00:35:57,103 --> 00:36:00,103
So ever since the doors
open, we saw everybody.

860
00:36:00,103 --> 00:36:02,033
- I mean,
she stood out for sure.
- Um-hmm.

861
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:03,414
I mean, from the look
in my eyes.

862
00:36:03,413 --> 00:36:04,693
Hmm.

863
00:36:04,689 --> 00:36:07,069
Do you want to, like,
settle down?

864
00:36:07,068 --> 00:36:08,308
- Eventually, yeah.
- Eventually?

865
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:09,520
For sure.

866
00:36:09,517 --> 00:36:12,207
Because McKenna
is so similar to Kelle,

867
00:36:12,206 --> 00:36:15,616
they both have
a very strong personality.

868
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:19,930
So I was not surprised
when McKenna started
shooting all these questions.

869
00:36:19,931 --> 00:36:23,171
For me personally,
it's easy to connect
with people,

870
00:36:23,172 --> 00:36:25,032
but the intensity
of the connection...

871
00:36:25,034 --> 00:36:26,314
[Jose] A 100%, yeah.

872
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:28,690
...you know, the throw me
against the
wall connections...

873
00:36:28,689 --> 00:36:29,789
Yes.

874
00:36:29,793 --> 00:36:32,103
Make out with me anywhere connection.

875
00:36:32,103 --> 00:36:33,213
[Jose] For sure.

876
00:36:33,206 --> 00:36:35,446
You know, do you have that
with my mom?

877
00:36:35,448 --> 00:36:38,658
Your mom has become
someone very special for me.

878
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:40,275
Like, really.

879
00:36:40,275 --> 00:36:43,895
But I tell her that
I like things...
take things slow.

880
00:36:43,896 --> 00:36:45,206
- Um-hmm.
- Is that you?

881
00:36:45,206 --> 00:36:47,026
A little bit. Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

882
00:36:47,034 --> 00:36:48,864
That's my...
I don't like to rush.

883
00:36:48,862 --> 00:36:50,282
[McKenna] Um-hmm.

884
00:36:50,275 --> 00:36:54,925
But I know my mom,
and she needs more touch.

885
00:36:54,931 --> 00:36:56,381
She's more physicality.

886
00:36:57,724 --> 00:37:00,174
You can respect a woman,
you still spank her.

887
00:37:00,172 --> 00:37:03,762
Like, like, guys do it
all the time.

888
00:37:03,758 --> 00:37:05,928
<i>Push her against the wall
and tell her how it is.</i>

889
00:37:07,275 --> 00:37:08,475
Yeah.

890
00:37:10,482 --> 00:37:12,622
<i>But Jose's a cutie.</i>

891
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:17,070
He's a little more reserved
than what I'm used to,

892
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,068
um, same with my mom, too.

893
00:37:19,068 --> 00:37:21,308
So, okay, I have
one more hard question.

894
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:22,660
Yeah, go ahead.

895
00:37:22,655 --> 00:37:25,305
It's just... if I asked you
to go on a date with me,
would you?

896
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:30,100
Um...

897
00:37:32,655 --> 00:37:33,655
Okay.

898
00:37:34,758 --> 00:37:35,828
- No.
- No?

899
00:37:35,827 --> 00:37:37,897
No. I do respect
for your mom. No.

900
00:37:37,896 --> 00:37:39,166
That's a good answer.

901
00:37:39,172 --> 00:37:42,282
Well, you never know, because
there's been situations...

902
00:37:42,275 --> 00:37:45,135
- Really?
- There has been situation,
one situation.

903
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:47,307
- Really? Like that.
- Yeah.

904
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:49,070
I think that's disrespectful.

905
00:37:49,068 --> 00:37:50,208
- Yeah.
- For both of you.

906
00:37:50,206 --> 00:37:51,516
I agree.

907
00:37:51,517 --> 00:37:53,307
With some of
McKenna's questions,

908
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:57,340
I get the impression
that she believes that

909
00:37:57,344 --> 00:38:01,934
Kelle and I are not aligned
in a lot of different aspects
of our lives,

910
00:38:02,724 --> 00:38:06,524
which makes me question
as well,

911
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:10,027
if it's a match for me or not.

912
00:38:11,448 --> 00:38:13,238
- Well, let's go back inside.
- Let's go.

913
00:38:13,241 --> 00:38:14,791
Thank you so much.

914
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:15,863
Thank you, McKenna.

915
00:38:15,862 --> 00:38:17,902
- [McKenna] You're so sweet.
- Thank you.

916
00:38:26,241 --> 00:38:30,211
[Joey] <i>It's been a long day,
and I'm a little bummed
about how today turned out.</i>

917
00:38:30,206 --> 00:38:34,406
And after being ignored
by Miss April
and her ex-husband

918
00:38:34,413 --> 00:38:37,413
<i>and I still haven't been able
to talk to April yet.</i>

919
00:38:37,413 --> 00:38:41,313
I feel like I'm kind of
just like left out
in the open alone.

920
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:43,410
<i>So I really need
to get some clarity</i>

921
00:38:43,413 --> 00:38:46,413
<i>to see if April takes me
as seriously
as I'm taking her.</i>

922
00:38:47,448 --> 00:38:48,788
What are you doing?

923
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:50,343
Just chilling out.

924
00:38:50,344 --> 00:38:51,694
Yeah. Can I talk to you
for a second?

925
00:38:51,689 --> 00:38:53,139
- [Joey] Yeah, of course.
- Yeah?

926
00:38:53,137 --> 00:38:54,827
- [Joey] Of course.
- Are you busy or something?

927
00:38:54,827 --> 00:38:56,067
No, no.

928
00:38:57,344 --> 00:38:59,074
I'm really excited
to talk to Emma.

929
00:38:59,068 --> 00:39:02,898
<i>It definitely feels
good to get a little bit
of attention today</i>

930
00:39:02,896 --> 00:39:05,446
by someone that might
actually want to talk to me.

931
00:39:05,448 --> 00:39:06,718
I ain't gonna lie.

932
00:39:07,482 --> 00:39:09,592
So you're very cute.

933
00:39:09,586 --> 00:39:11,376
Thank you. Thank you.

934
00:39:11,379 --> 00:39:12,829
- You're.
- You're too.

935
00:39:12,827 --> 00:39:15,657
I'm very picky with people,
like, the people that
I... that I like.

936
00:39:16,344 --> 00:39:17,384
I'm blushing.

937
00:39:17,379 --> 00:39:18,859
Don't blush.

938
00:39:18,862 --> 00:39:21,412
You're like a little red.

939
00:39:21,413 --> 00:39:24,793
[Joey] <i>When a woman
starts hitting on me,
I try to play it cool.</i>

940
00:39:24,793 --> 00:39:30,243
Maybe I like, blush a little
bit, but, like, I know I got
the suave and the swag.

941
00:39:30,241 --> 00:39:31,621
I keep it pretty cool.

942
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,410
I try to keep
a straight face.

943
00:39:35,448 --> 00:39:37,658
What did you think about me?

944
00:39:37,655 --> 00:39:40,065
Oh, the second I saw you,
I was like,

945
00:39:40,068 --> 00:39:42,758
that is
a spitting image of Pola.

946
00:39:42,758 --> 00:39:44,138
Because you don't know,
but Pola...

947
00:39:44,137 --> 00:39:45,377
But that's a good thing.

948
00:39:45,379 --> 00:39:46,689
Yeah, oh, great thing.

949
00:39:46,689 --> 00:39:47,789
Okay. Okay. Okay.

950
00:39:47,793 --> 00:39:49,553
But, yeah,
I love your mother.

951
00:39:49,551 --> 00:39:50,721
She's very beautiful.

952
00:39:50,724 --> 00:39:51,934
Oh, really?

953
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,931
And when I saw you today,
I was like, "Oh, my God.

954
00:39:53,931 --> 00:39:56,831
- That is Pola's daughter,
for sure."
- Yeah.

955
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:59,897
You are like, Oh, my God,
you're such a good person.

956
00:39:59,896 --> 00:40:04,236
I could just tell just by
looking in someone's eyes.

957
00:40:04,241 --> 00:40:06,381
You could really tell
if they're being genuine
or not.

958
00:40:06,379 --> 00:40:07,379
Yeah.

959
00:40:08,103 --> 00:40:09,483
So...

960
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,550
I mean, since day one,
it's been, you know, like

961
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:21,971
I said, our chemistry
is really met,

962
00:40:21,965 --> 00:40:25,925
but it's hard to say
whether she's gonna be
my girlfriend or not.

963
00:40:25,931 --> 00:40:29,411
I'm a little hurt about
what happened earlier today
with April,

964
00:40:29,413 --> 00:40:32,693
and I'm starting to wonder
if April
is the right one for me.

965
00:40:32,689 --> 00:40:34,719
So you'll be down to know me?

966
00:40:35,482 --> 00:40:37,212
Honestly, I'm kind of torn.

967
00:40:37,206 --> 00:40:39,306
As much as I love
talking to April,

968
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:41,210
I like talking to Emma, too.

969
00:40:41,206 --> 00:40:44,546
Oh, I'd be down
and get to know you
way better.

970
00:40:45,586 --> 00:40:47,206
[Emma] Okay. Awesome.

971
00:40:47,206 --> 00:40:49,096
What did I just get
myself into?

972
00:40:50,413 --> 00:40:51,973
Holy [bleep]

973
00:40:52,448 --> 00:40:54,208
[woman] Okay.

974
00:40:55,448 --> 00:40:58,858
I don't know this could get
out of control really quickly.

975
00:40:58,862 --> 00:41:00,452
[woman] Oh.

976
00:41:00,448 --> 00:41:02,028
[indistinct]

977
00:41:02,034 --> 00:41:04,454
[Pola] I was watching,
but I was not watching.

978
00:41:04,448 --> 00:41:05,618
For me, it's not fun.

979
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:09,140
When Billy came in,
I was so excited to meet him.

980
00:41:09,137 --> 00:41:13,617
And when he took you away,
I kind of felt, like,
disrespected in a way.

981
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:15,310
If there's a chance
you guys will talk.

982
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:18,860
Excuse my language,
but I could give [bleep]
get to know him.

983
00:41:18,862 --> 00:41:22,142
You will each write a letter
to your partner

984
00:41:22,137 --> 00:41:26,687
stating your intentions
and if you would like
this relationship

985
00:41:26,689 --> 00:41:29,479
to continue outside the villa.

986
00:41:29,482 --> 00:41:32,382
[Kelle]
<i>I'm really emotional writing
this letter to Jose right now</i>

987
00:41:32,379 --> 00:41:36,719
because for the first time
I feel like I really have
connected with somebody

988
00:41:36,724 --> 00:41:39,694
who gets me
and actually has my back.

989
00:41:41,482 --> 00:41:45,102
And, um, I really just
don't want to say goodbye.

990
00:41:47,103 --> 00:41:51,033
I sincerely have nothing but
good to say about you, Joey.

991
00:41:51,034 --> 00:41:54,664
Our journey's
coming to an end,
it's time for me to...

992
00:41:54,655 --> 00:41:56,445
to tell him how I feel.

993
00:41:56,448 --> 00:42:00,448
And I just hope
we're both on the same page.

994
00:42:04,034 --> 00:42:07,004
I can't even begin to express
the emotions

995
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,860
that are currently running
through my head.

996
00:42:08,862 --> 00:42:10,282
<i>I want to be sincere.</i>

997
00:42:10,275 --> 00:42:12,615
<i>I want to be clear,
but I'm not really clear</i>

998
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:15,000
because I don't know
if there's gonna be
a future or not.

999
00:42:17,482 --> 00:42:19,762
[Gabriel]
<i>This is scary because
we are such good friends</i>

1000
00:42:19,758 --> 00:42:23,238
that if we turn it romantic,
it could ruin
our lifelong friendship.

1001
00:42:23,241 --> 00:42:25,001
[Stefany] <i>So this is it.</i>

1002
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,140
<i>I want to get married again.</i>

1003
00:42:27,137 --> 00:42:31,857
You know, I'm hoping
that he could be ready
for some commitment here.

1004
00:42:31,862 --> 00:42:34,522
Do you think there's a chance
for us to be a couple

1005
00:42:34,517 --> 00:42:35,547
when we get back to L.A.?
