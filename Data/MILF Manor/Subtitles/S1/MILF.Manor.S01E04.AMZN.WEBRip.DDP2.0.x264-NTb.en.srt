1
00:00:02,068 --> 00:00:06,098
I've been told,
I'm a very good kisser.

2
00:00:06,103 --> 00:00:08,103
[laughs]
Oh, my God.

3
00:00:08,103 --> 00:00:10,833
Billy's definitely one
of my favorites.

4
00:00:13,517 --> 00:00:14,997
Billy and I had
a good time today.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
He was amazing.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,690
He said, he has a big [bleep].

7
00:00:17,689 --> 00:00:19,899
[Stefany] <i>Kelle is a little
wild for him.</i>

8
00:00:19,896 --> 00:00:20,896
- No.
- No?

9
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:21,896
- Not at all.
- Okay.

10
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:22,896
Just make sure I'm not around.

11
00:00:24,172 --> 00:00:25,382
[Kelle laughs]

12
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:26,309
I love your eyes.

13
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:27,969
Thank you.

14
00:00:27,965 --> 00:00:31,205
Stefany caught my eye
because she just seems
so sweet,

15
00:00:31,206 --> 00:00:32,826
<i>and I think she's
super pretty.</i>

16
00:00:32,827 --> 00:00:33,717
I'm excited.

17
00:00:33,724 --> 00:00:35,694
We are the best.

18
00:00:35,689 --> 00:00:39,169
I'm gonna ask Stefany
to come dancing
with me tonight.

19
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:40,282
[all cheering]

20
00:00:40,275 --> 00:00:41,475
[Gabriel] <i>I was
kind of bummed.</i>

21
00:00:41,482 --> 00:00:43,382
I don't really have my eye
on anyone else.

22
00:00:44,724 --> 00:00:46,384
You went on a date
with Harrison.

23
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,379
He's a smooth guy, huh?

24
00:00:48,379 --> 00:00:50,209
[Ryan] <i>Gabriel's just doing
a little too much for me.</i>

25
00:00:50,206 --> 00:00:52,306
<i>Gabriel likes attention.</i>

26
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:53,690
Have you been to
Bulgaria before?

27
00:00:53,689 --> 00:00:56,309
It's just been fun.
Like, more friends.

28
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,070
[Stefany] <i>I do like Gabriel
a lot.</i>

29
00:00:58,068 --> 00:01:00,898
but I'm a little confused
at this point.

30
00:01:00,896 --> 00:01:03,406
I'm gonna be down
for you but you gotta
make time.

31
00:01:03,413 --> 00:01:05,723
Cheers to more dates.

32
00:01:05,724 --> 00:01:07,794
I think that she's interested
in me...

33
00:01:08,586 --> 00:01:10,026
a hundred percent.

34
00:01:21,827 --> 00:01:23,787
[Shannan] <i>So, there's been
some developments
in the villa.</i>

35
00:01:23,793 --> 00:01:25,283
I'm not the one to gossip

36
00:01:25,275 --> 00:01:28,685
but it looks like
Billy and Kelle are taking
things to the next level.

37
00:01:29,827 --> 00:01:33,997
And how cute
is it that April J and Joey,

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,620
<i>the oldest person
and the youngest person
in the house,</i>

39
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,480
have this love connection
going on.

40
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:43,100
I have no idea what's going
on with April W and Ricky.

41
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,283
They are always MIA.

42
00:01:45,275 --> 00:01:47,995
<i>And I know that Ryan
has his eyes set on Stefany,</i>

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,900
however, you know, Stefany
and Gabriel

44
00:01:50,896 --> 00:01:53,926
<i>are definitely spending more
time together,</i>

45
00:01:53,931 --> 00:01:57,411
and so she needs to woman up

46
00:01:57,413 --> 00:02:01,173
and be clear about what
it is that she wants,

47
00:02:01,172 --> 00:02:02,482
and who she wants it with.

48
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:08,996
[Ryan] How you feeling?

49
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,480
I'm always feeling great.

50
00:02:13,275 --> 00:02:14,895
Aw!

51
00:02:14,896 --> 00:02:17,476
I just went on a date
with Ryan yesterday.

52
00:02:17,482 --> 00:02:18,902
<i>I had a great time.</i>

53
00:02:18,896 --> 00:02:20,996
I felt a connection with him,

54
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,620
so, I'm definitely open
to getting to know each other
a little better.

55
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,100
- [Ryan] You taking my ...
- I know.

56
00:02:28,103 --> 00:02:29,383
I'm tired.

57
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:31,169
[Ryan] Um, me too.

58
00:02:31,172 --> 00:02:35,412
You're so, like, ready to go
to like a Hollywood bar
or something.

59
00:02:35,413 --> 00:02:37,243
- [Ryan] You said,
a Hollywood bar?
- [Stefany] Yeah.

60
00:02:39,482 --> 00:02:42,102
Me and Stef, at this point,
are kind of building on what
we've been building on.

61
00:02:42,103 --> 00:02:43,413
I'm doing my thing.

62
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,283
<i>I think that we developed
a very strong connection.</i>

63
00:02:45,275 --> 00:02:46,375
It's not a forged chemistry.

64
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:47,929
I think it's been
pretty genuine.

65
00:02:47,931 --> 00:02:49,791
- Oh, no.
- I want to be like you when
I grow up.

66
00:02:49,793 --> 00:02:50,933
You know what I'm saying?

67
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,590
Ryan keeps trying to, like,
hit on Stefany and stuff.

68
00:02:55,586 --> 00:02:57,276
<i>I'm not one to judge</i>

69
00:02:57,275 --> 00:02:59,925
<i>but Stefany's just--
she likes to play nice,
you know, sometimes.</i>

70
00:02:59,931 --> 00:03:02,381
So, I feel like that could
definitely be read as like,

71
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:04,069
"Oh! She might like you,"
you know.

72
00:03:04,413 --> 00:03:05,523
This is fun.

73
00:03:05,517 --> 00:03:07,307
He tries so hard to, like,

74
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,280
try and make his moves
and stuff, you know.

75
00:03:09,275 --> 00:03:11,895
So then, I pull up,
I'm like, "Stefany."

76
00:03:11,896 --> 00:03:13,306
- [Gabriel] Come on.
- That's so true, like, when--

77
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,280
[Gabriel] Lets dance.

78
00:03:17,206 --> 00:03:18,476
[Stefany cheering]

79
00:03:18,482 --> 00:03:19,592
I just think it's funny.

80
00:03:21,586 --> 00:03:23,066
Okay.

81
00:03:23,068 --> 00:03:25,478
I just think it's kind of lame
if you see me vibing
with somebody,

82
00:03:25,482 --> 00:03:27,212
if you see me in the middle
of a conversation,

83
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:29,476
<i>for you to, like, come and try
to, like, disrupt that vibe.</i>

84
00:03:29,482 --> 00:03:32,522
You know, you're telling me,
this guy's just a friend,

85
00:03:32,517 --> 00:03:34,587
you know, you would never
consider really dating him,

86
00:03:34,586 --> 00:03:36,716
<i>like, I'm confused
at this point.</i>

87
00:03:36,724 --> 00:03:38,314
How am I your favorite?

88
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,000
And how are you acting
like that?

89
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
<i>'Cause at the end of the day
you can't play with him.</i>

90
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
<i>And I can't blame
him if you are.</i>

91
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,480
You gotta draw
a line somewhere.

92
00:03:56,379 --> 00:03:59,719
[both speaking in Spanish]

93
00:03:59,724 --> 00:04:01,384
- Exactly.
- [Jose] <i>Salud.</i>

94
00:04:03,413 --> 00:04:07,383
So far, who are the ladies
that you're interested
in getting to know better?

95
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:08,999
So...

96
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,100
<i>Soyoung, I mean, you can
sense her energy, right?</i>

97
00:04:11,103 --> 00:04:12,933
[Ryan] Yeah.
Incredible energy.

98
00:04:12,931 --> 00:04:14,721
- [Ryan] Unexpected energy.
- For sure.

99
00:04:14,724 --> 00:04:16,384
'Cause she's not super vocal,

100
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:18,689
but, like, when you hop
in the zone,

101
00:04:18,689 --> 00:04:20,209
- she's like, yeah.
- For sure.

102
00:04:20,206 --> 00:04:21,896
[Jose] Your mom is one
of the ladies that I think

103
00:04:21,896 --> 00:04:24,926
- that she is the most
interesting and elegant.
- [Ryan] Got you.

104
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,211
[Ryan] <i>I think Jose has
a relevant shot with my mom.</i>

105
00:04:27,206 --> 00:04:29,066
He seems very genuine
and daring.

106
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:31,278
So, that's definitely
my mom's style.

107
00:04:31,275 --> 00:04:32,925
<i>Other than that,
not gonna lie,</i>

108
00:04:32,931 --> 00:04:34,481
Jose has a great accent.

109
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,832
[laughs]

110
00:04:37,827 --> 00:04:39,207
- You?
- [Ryan] Um...

111
00:04:39,206 --> 00:04:40,476
I'm going to be honest,

112
00:04:40,482 --> 00:04:42,312
- my date with Stefany
was amazing.
- [Jose] Yeah?

113
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,930
[Ryan laughs]

114
00:04:46,172 --> 00:04:47,832
[Stefany]

115
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:55,479
- So far, what I've gotten
from her has been really cool.
- [Jose] Okay.

116
00:04:55,482 --> 00:04:57,622
But it's just so far
I'm feeling between

117
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,310
because of the dynamic
that Gabriel has...

118
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,550
- [Jose] For sure.
- ...with her.

119
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,591
[Ryan] My girl, I can barely
get her out of the corner.

120
00:05:03,586 --> 00:05:04,996
Yeah. Literally,
my conversation was,

121
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,620
"Look, this is how I feel
about you,

122
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,070
and I'm interested in building
on that.

123
00:05:10,068 --> 00:05:11,998
You gotta tell that dude,

124
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,900
if that's not your intent
with him,

125
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:18,996
then don't give
him a different narrative."

126
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,100
I see myself being
in a potential match
with Stefany

127
00:05:22,103 --> 00:05:24,693
<i>but the elephant in the room
is Gabriel.</i>

128
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:27,689
All I'm looking for,
at this point, is clarity
on this situation.

129
00:05:27,689 --> 00:05:30,619
The worst thing you can do
to somebody is not be honest,

130
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,860
- I'm telling you that now.
- [Jose] For sure.

131
00:05:31,862 --> 00:05:33,832
[Ryan] Nobody wants to build
relationships like that.

132
00:05:33,827 --> 00:05:36,167
- You need to know that when
you're with someone,
- [Ryan] Come on.

133
00:05:36,172 --> 00:05:37,382
you can trust.

134
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:38,589
[Ryan] That's what we need.

135
00:05:38,586 --> 00:05:40,476
<i>- Salud</i> with that.
<i>- Salud</i> with that.

136
00:05:40,482 --> 00:05:41,902
[laughs]

137
00:05:46,172 --> 00:05:48,382
You pack your suitcase
just for your hats?

138
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:51,479
[Shannan speaking]

139
00:05:51,482 --> 00:05:53,172
You look great in hats.

140
00:05:53,172 --> 00:05:55,522
Everyone! Daters...

141
00:05:55,517 --> 00:05:57,377
It's time for you to decide

142
00:05:57,379 --> 00:06:01,519
whether or not you have
chemistry with the other
people in the villa.

143
00:06:01,517 --> 00:06:05,897
If you are already vibing
with someone then carry on.

144
00:06:05,896 --> 00:06:07,406
But if you're unsure

145
00:06:07,413 --> 00:06:10,523
whether you have a connection,
then listen up.

146
00:06:10,517 --> 00:06:14,617
For the next hour,
everyone in the house
should take five minutes

147
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,100
getting to know anyone
they're unsure about.

148
00:06:17,103 --> 00:06:18,793
This has nothing to do
with looks.

149
00:06:18,793 --> 00:06:22,103
You're trying to determine
whether you have chemistry
with that person.

150
00:06:22,103 --> 00:06:24,723
You will interact with someone
you haven't before

151
00:06:24,724 --> 00:06:26,414
to rate them
on chemistry scale.

152
00:06:29,206 --> 00:06:32,896
We have to rate each person
from one to ten. And...

153
00:06:34,275 --> 00:06:36,275
so, bring your 'A' game.

154
00:06:36,275 --> 00:06:38,685
[all cheering]

155
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,279
[Ryan] <i>I like it.
I like speed dating.</i>

156
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:43,205
it is kind of old school.
It's kind of a classic
feel but...

157
00:06:43,206 --> 00:06:44,476
I like stuff like that.

158
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,720
- [laughs]
- [laughs] So...

159
00:06:52,793 --> 00:06:55,003
[Soyoung] <i>I never done
a speed dating, ever.</i>

160
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,280
<i>I still don't have any
connection to anybody.</i>

161
00:06:57,275 --> 00:06:59,925
So, I'm definitely ready
for meeting all men.

162
00:06:59,931 --> 00:07:02,901
Hopefully, Jose comes.
[laughs]

163
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:06,169
[Charlene] <i>You're this so
L.A. vibe,</i>

164
00:07:06,172 --> 00:07:08,832
are you really looking
for love? Or, I mean,
do you want--

165
00:07:08,827 --> 00:07:10,997
Honestly, I'm such a lover,

166
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,930
I even put lover boy
on my thing.

167
00:07:12,931 --> 00:07:13,931
Yeah.
[chuckles]

168
00:07:13,931 --> 00:07:16,171
But, uh, I'm very romantic
and everything.

169
00:07:16,172 --> 00:07:18,002
What about in the bedroom?

170
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,830
- Uh...
- Be honest. That's fine.
I'm just curious.

171
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:23,589
Are you good in bed?

172
00:07:24,724 --> 00:07:27,624
What's, like, your
signature move?
Do you have one?

173
00:07:28,275 --> 00:07:29,095
What gets you going?

174
00:07:29,896 --> 00:07:30,926
Is it the boobs?

175
00:07:30,931 --> 00:07:32,521
I mean, could that be?
Or are you a butt man?

176
00:07:32,517 --> 00:07:36,617
Like, what's going to seal
the deal for you that, like,
we got-- it's there?

177
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,690
I, kind of, am the type
of person where I just
don't jump into something,

178
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:40,999
- if it makes sense.
- Right.

179
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,520
I view it very, like,
spiritual, like,
that's my temple,

180
00:07:43,517 --> 00:07:47,687
that's someone temple,
it really has to be super
important and like, special.

181
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:48,759
Oh.

182
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:53,283
[Gabriel] <i>Charlene kept
jumping in and...</i>

183
00:07:53,275 --> 00:07:54,515
straight up to the point.

184
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:56,277
She's like, "So, how do
you like it in bed?"

185
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:58,995
Like, tell me about your...
your sex life.

186
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,310
Like, it was just so much.

187
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:04,100
And for me to talk about
to a random stranger, like,

188
00:08:04,103 --> 00:08:07,313
<i>to just be vulnerable
and open up like that
was uncomfortable.</i>

189
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,100
- I didn't even know
that happened.
- Yeah.

190
00:08:09,103 --> 00:08:10,313
You know, she was talking
about, like...

191
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,100
- She's pretty straightforward.
- Straightforward.

192
00:08:12,103 --> 00:08:14,413
[Gabriel] <i>Which isn't bad
but definitely not...</i>

193
00:08:14,413 --> 00:08:17,693
- Just... Yeah.
- ...my cup of tea, I think.

194
00:08:17,689 --> 00:08:19,209
[Charlene] I'm a really
good kisser.

195
00:08:19,206 --> 00:08:20,826
I had a lot of practice
in high school

196
00:08:20,827 --> 00:08:23,997
that I was a above the waist
kind of gal. I still am.

197
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,170
I was called
"The queen of blue balls."

198
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,590
Damn.

199
00:08:29,482 --> 00:08:31,072
<i>Communication is important.</i>

200
00:08:31,068 --> 00:08:35,928
I know what my needs are
and I know they needed
to be met, like yesterday.

201
00:08:35,931 --> 00:08:38,721
<i>I've been ready to go out into
the deep end.</i>

202
00:08:38,724 --> 00:08:41,594
Like, does anybody know
how to swim here or what?

203
00:08:41,586 --> 00:08:43,516
What are some of, like,
your hobbies?

204
00:08:43,517 --> 00:08:44,477
Oh, boy.

205
00:08:45,103 --> 00:08:46,103
Fun.

206
00:08:48,275 --> 00:08:50,305
[Jimmy] <i>All right.
Well, I picked you.</i>

207
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,480
I definitely wanted to get
to know you more.

208
00:08:52,482 --> 00:08:53,412
- [Stefany] That's sweet.
- I'm...
[stammers]

209
00:08:53,413 --> 00:08:55,383
- [laughs]
- I'm interested...

210
00:08:55,379 --> 00:08:57,209
Why me, though?

211
00:08:57,206 --> 00:08:59,686
You have great skin.
You have good taste.

212
00:08:59,689 --> 00:09:01,409
- I love the anklet.
- [laughs]

213
00:09:01,413 --> 00:09:04,313
Yeah. I love toe rings,
anklets, feet.

214
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:08,070
Soft skin, nice legs,
nice hands.

215
00:09:08,068 --> 00:09:09,448
<i>I'm definitely
feeling Stefany.</i>

216
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:12,168
She's cool. She's like,
you know, she doesn't
feel that...

217
00:09:12,172 --> 00:09:13,622
you know, older than
me, really.

218
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,900
- I don't know.
- You think she's my type?

219
00:09:14,896 --> 00:09:17,376
Well, she's a cool person
but she's not your type.

220
00:09:17,379 --> 00:09:20,209
She might have a wide,
but she don't have out.

221
00:09:20,206 --> 00:09:23,786
- Yeah. You know I like
the out. Like...
- [laughs]

222
00:09:26,827 --> 00:09:28,407
[Jose] <i>Buenas noches.</i> Hellos.

223
00:09:28,413 --> 00:09:30,213
- Jose!
- [Jose] Very happy
to be here with you.

224
00:09:30,206 --> 00:09:32,406
- [Soyoung] Oh! You are.
Thank you.
- I am.

225
00:09:32,413 --> 00:09:33,793
- [Soyoung] I'm very
happy, too.
- You're cold?

226
00:09:33,793 --> 00:09:34,793
- No.
- [Jose] No?

227
00:09:34,793 --> 00:09:35,793
Now, I'm getting hot.

228
00:09:35,793 --> 00:09:37,903
- Hot, okay. Okay. Okay.
- [laughs]

229
00:09:37,896 --> 00:09:40,586
Jose, he's got, like,
height and the eyes

230
00:09:40,586 --> 00:09:44,206
<i>and, you know, the F's
and all the style
that I've been looking for.</i>

231
00:09:44,206 --> 00:09:45,476
[inhales deeply]

232
00:09:45,482 --> 00:09:47,102
I'm like, mmm-mmm.

233
00:09:47,103 --> 00:09:49,793
Ever since I got here,
all, they're asking me,

234
00:09:49,793 --> 00:09:51,483
"Oh! Who do you think
that you could date?"

235
00:09:51,482 --> 00:09:52,482
I chose you.

236
00:09:52,482 --> 00:09:54,412
Well, I'm glad that
this happened.

237
00:09:54,413 --> 00:09:56,933
- [Soyoung] Yeah.
- So, we-- we both know now

238
00:09:56,931 --> 00:09:58,691
and we're both in agreement.

239
00:09:58,689 --> 00:09:59,789
- [Soyoung] Mmm-hmm.
- For sure.

240
00:09:59,793 --> 00:10:01,483
- [Jose] Definitely.
- Yeah. That's awesome.

241
00:10:01,482 --> 00:10:04,282
There's something about
you that just makes you glow.

242
00:10:04,275 --> 00:10:07,995
I considering your eyes
and I considering the way
that you... that you speak,

243
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,790
I would love to go on a date
or something.

244
00:10:10,793 --> 00:10:12,483
- Mmm. Okay.
- [Jose] Like, to get to know
each other

245
00:10:12,482 --> 00:10:14,002
with more than four minutes.

246
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,790
Maybe a dinner or something.

247
00:10:15,793 --> 00:10:18,383
I think there's a chance,
like, to get that connection,
you know.

248
00:10:18,379 --> 00:10:19,999
Okay. Yes.

249
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,790
[inhales deeply]
Jose just asked me to date.

250
00:10:22,793 --> 00:10:25,103
<i>I was shocked that he's been
thinking about me.</i>

251
00:10:25,103 --> 00:10:27,003
I thought I had loved Jose

252
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,620
but now I love him more
than ever.
[laughs]

253
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,410
Sounds good. I love it.

254
00:10:34,413 --> 00:10:37,103
[Shannan] <i>So, what's the first
thing that, like, you might
be attracted to?</i>

255
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:39,003
Like, eyes or a smile.

256
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
- Being honest...
- Mmm-hmm

257
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,930
Your feet.

258
00:10:41,931 --> 00:10:43,791
- You... you got a foot fetish?
- Yeah.

259
00:10:43,793 --> 00:10:46,173
- Oh, Lord.
[laughs]
- [Ricky] So, like, if...

260
00:10:46,172 --> 00:10:47,692
[Shannan] <i>Ricky is hilarious.</i>

261
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:49,279
I feel like I'm at home
with Ricky

262
00:10:49,275 --> 00:10:52,065
because he is from Detroit,
I grew up in Detroit.

263
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,588
But, yeah, I need a little
bit more energy.

264
00:10:54,586 --> 00:10:56,926
- You're like a undercover
freak or somethin'.
- Yes. I'm like that.

265
00:10:56,931 --> 00:10:58,411
[Shannan laughs]

266
00:10:58,413 --> 00:11:00,523
I'mma always keep
my feet tight.

267
00:11:00,517 --> 00:11:02,377
My game is just
with me and me.

268
00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:04,689
Like, if I got to go outside
myself and meet you,

269
00:11:04,689 --> 00:11:06,479
like, I don't need
to have you.

270
00:11:06,482 --> 00:11:07,932
You're very quiet.

271
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,896
My personality is talk to me,
I'll talk back.

272
00:11:12,896 --> 00:11:15,616
Like, I'm not gonna be
like, hi.

273
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,690
So, I'm curious, who do
you have your eye on?

274
00:11:21,827 --> 00:11:23,617
- I don't want to say
any names.
- [Kelle] Why?

275
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,860
[Kelle] Why not?

276
00:11:24,862 --> 00:11:28,102
If you want something,
you say it and you go for it.

277
00:11:28,103 --> 00:11:30,173
I don't want to say
what I want.

278
00:11:30,172 --> 00:11:32,792
<i>Trying to get to know Ricky
on this speed date</i>

279
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:36,283
but literally he's not saying
anything, asking no questions.

280
00:11:36,275 --> 00:11:39,305
<i>The fact that he doesn't speak
unless spoken to,</i>

281
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:42,100
is like super weird to me.

282
00:11:42,103 --> 00:11:44,283
It is the first time
that we actually had time
to really...

283
00:11:44,275 --> 00:11:45,475
I know.

284
00:11:45,482 --> 00:11:47,002
So, what kind of things
do you like?

285
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
- Music, concerts or--
- [Ricky] I like-- I'm not--

286
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,520
I'm not really a music person.

287
00:11:51,068 --> 00:11:52,278
Oh, really?

288
00:11:52,275 --> 00:11:55,165
Like, I'm like an onion, like,
you gotta peel me back.

289
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:56,172
Yeah.

290
00:11:56,724 --> 00:11:57,724
Yeah.

291
00:11:57,724 --> 00:11:59,104
Well, let me get real
with you.

292
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,413
Like, physical attraction.

293
00:12:00,413 --> 00:12:03,103
How important is that
big booty? You know, like...

294
00:12:03,103 --> 00:12:05,623
- Uh, you know what?
- [chuckles]

295
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,100
The results of the chemistry
tests are in.

296
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:10,003
There's one mother and son

297
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,210
- that scored the lowest.
- Oh.

298
00:12:12,206 --> 00:12:14,586
- And they will be going home.
- [gasps]

299
00:12:14,586 --> 00:12:15,926
- [woman 1] No.
- [woman 2] What? No.

300
00:12:20,827 --> 00:12:21,897
[Charlene] <i>So, was I on
your list?</i>

301
00:12:21,896 --> 00:12:23,276
- You were definitely
on my list.
- Oh, okay.

302
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:25,095
Um, I was like, I would like
to know.

303
00:12:25,103 --> 00:12:27,693
- [Charlene] Well, that's nice.
- I was very curious.

304
00:12:27,689 --> 00:12:29,099
I am still into Stefany,

305
00:12:29,103 --> 00:12:31,283
but I'm open to dating
other ladies in the house.

306
00:12:31,275 --> 00:12:32,895
<i>You never know.</i>

307
00:12:32,896 --> 00:12:35,276
My match could be right under
my nose and I might not even
know her yet.

308
00:12:35,275 --> 00:12:37,585
What are some things that are
important to you,
first of all?

309
00:12:37,586 --> 00:12:38,996
Well, let me get real
with you.

310
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,280
Like, physical attraction.

311
00:12:40,275 --> 00:12:43,165
How important is that big
booty, though?
You know, like...

312
00:12:43,172 --> 00:12:44,482
- Uh, you know what?
- [Charlene] Come on.

313
00:12:44,482 --> 00:12:46,692
[chuckles]
'Cause that's what I'll think.
I'll be like...

314
00:12:46,689 --> 00:12:48,519
- I like big booty, okay.
- [Charlene] Nah!

315
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:49,997
- [Charlene] I mean, come on.
- I'm an ass man.

316
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
- [laughs]
- Okay. Honestly,
I'm a ass man.

317
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,210
- Like--
- A shocker. Oh, my God.
I'm so shocked.

318
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:56,276
[both laughing]

319
00:12:56,275 --> 00:13:00,375
I just think a lot of men
that are ass men
that they're ass driven.

320
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:01,619
It's like, ass first.

321
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,590
- [laughs]
- [Charlene] Like, is that's
your focus?

322
00:13:04,586 --> 00:13:07,096
Charlene is a whole body
aggressive woman.

323
00:13:07,103 --> 00:13:09,693
So, I'm not surprised when
she's telling me what
she's telling me,

324
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:12,689
but it might be a little
too pushy for me.

325
00:13:12,689 --> 00:13:15,519
I'll ask you some more
questions later.
Thank you.

326
00:13:15,517 --> 00:13:18,277
She is saying what she wants
and she's not apologetic
about it.

327
00:13:18,275 --> 00:13:20,165
So, hey, to each it's own,
it's gonna work,

328
00:13:20,172 --> 00:13:22,622
for some people it might
not though, for others.

329
00:13:25,896 --> 00:13:27,996
- [Billy] <i>Hi.</i>
- [April W] <i>Oh!
My first person.</i>

330
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,480
- Hey, Billy. How are you?
- Good.

331
00:13:30,482 --> 00:13:33,102
- All right. So. I'm gonna ask
you some questions.
- [Billy] Okay.

332
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,623
- Um...
- [April W] Are
you spontaneous?

333
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,520
I would say
I'm very spontaneous.

334
00:13:37,206 --> 00:13:38,206
Are you aggressive?

335
00:13:38,793 --> 00:13:40,283
Mmm-mmm.

336
00:13:40,275 --> 00:13:41,925
If you want to kiss
will you take it?

337
00:13:41,931 --> 00:13:45,171
I'm sometimes the type
of person that will, like,
ask like...

338
00:13:45,172 --> 00:13:46,282
do you want to kiss?

339
00:13:46,275 --> 00:13:47,825
In a sense...

340
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:52,277
April Watson needs to work
on her interviewing skills.
[laughs]

341
00:13:52,275 --> 00:13:53,615
Will you pull a jimmy?

342
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,100
Sorry.

343
00:13:55,103 --> 00:13:57,693
What was Jimmy's dirty secret?

344
00:13:57,689 --> 00:14:00,309
I got pink eye from
[bleep] ass.

345
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,930
[all cheering and laughing]

346
00:14:02,931 --> 00:14:04,071
I knew it!

347
00:14:04,068 --> 00:14:05,618
It's a normal thing.

348
00:14:07,482 --> 00:14:09,412
- Oh! [bleep]
- [laughs]

349
00:14:09,413 --> 00:14:12,283
- I'm not [bleep] completely.
- [laughs]
Okay.

350
00:14:12,275 --> 00:14:14,925
- How about you? Did you ever
pull a jimmy?
- [April W] Hey! Hey!

351
00:14:14,931 --> 00:14:18,001
I won't pull a jimmy.
That doesn't mean
I don't like the jimmy.

352
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,480
- Oh! For sure.
- [both laughing]

353
00:14:20,482 --> 00:14:21,722
[April W laughs]
Oh, God!

354
00:14:21,724 --> 00:14:24,834
Uh, it was a little
bit intimidating.

355
00:14:24,827 --> 00:14:26,067
Well, it was nice chatting.

356
00:14:26,068 --> 00:14:27,378
- Nice chatting with you, too.
- [Billy] Cool.

357
00:14:27,379 --> 00:14:29,309
- I appreciate it.
- [Billy] Take it easy.

358
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:31,590
I have such
a strong personality,

359
00:14:31,586 --> 00:14:34,896
I would totally dominate
somebody like Billy.

360
00:14:34,896 --> 00:14:38,306
And I wouldn't want to do that
because he's such a sweet guy.

361
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,170
- How are you doing?
- Hey, Joey.

362
00:14:40,172 --> 00:14:42,282
So, my question
to you is, Joey,

363
00:14:42,275 --> 00:14:45,825
what makes you experienced
enough for an older woman?

364
00:14:45,827 --> 00:14:47,717
You need to sell me on that.

365
00:14:47,724 --> 00:14:49,594
Are you talking about sexually

366
00:14:49,586 --> 00:14:50,716
- Yeah.
- or just everything?

367
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,624
- Sexually.
- Sexually!

368
00:14:54,103 --> 00:15:00,003
Okay. Well, I haven't had, uh,
like, as much sexual
experience as you.

369
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,830
Have you ever been
with a older woman?

370
00:15:01,827 --> 00:15:04,687
I have not been
with a older woman sexually.

371
00:15:05,413 --> 00:15:06,383
Okay.

372
00:15:07,793 --> 00:15:09,283
Would you ever pull a jimmy?

373
00:15:10,172 --> 00:15:11,482
- A jimmy?
- [laughs]

374
00:15:11,482 --> 00:15:13,312
That's just out
of my comfort zone.

375
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,720
What is up with no one wants
to pull a jimmy!

376
00:15:15,724 --> 00:15:18,484
I will do most of the things
that you want me to do.

377
00:15:18,482 --> 00:15:20,172
- Except [bleep] ass.
- Yeah.

378
00:15:20,172 --> 00:15:21,282
[April W] That's good to know.

379
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
[Joey] <i>It's a little awkward.</i>

380
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,070
Would I ever do the jimmy
to her?

381
00:15:28,068 --> 00:15:30,408
I didn't know she was coming
on like with you.

382
00:15:30,413 --> 00:15:32,173
- She did it to everyone.
- What?

383
00:15:33,689 --> 00:15:35,589
[Jose] <i>It's a pleasure getting
time to connect</i>

384
00:15:35,586 --> 00:15:37,586
- Right.
- and to learn a little more
about you.

385
00:15:37,586 --> 00:15:39,476
- So--
- So, if you saw me at a bar,

386
00:15:39,482 --> 00:15:41,102
would you asked me, like,
my age?

387
00:15:41,103 --> 00:15:46,003
I would be so interested
to learn so many things
about you before your age.

388
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,620
When you meet somebody,
what's the first thing

389
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,900
- that catches you eye?
- Um...

390
00:15:48,896 --> 00:15:50,476
The smile.

391
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:51,482
- [Jose] Yeah?
- Definitely. Yeah.

392
00:15:51,482 --> 00:15:53,692
You have a really
amazing smile.

393
00:15:53,689 --> 00:15:56,619
- Thank you. Thank you.
You do, too, as well.
- Yeah.

394
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,720
Jose and I are definitely
hitting it off.

395
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:00,624
<i>But I think at this time</i>

396
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:04,480
<i>I'm content where, you know,
things are with Ryan
and Gabriel.</i>

397
00:16:04,482 --> 00:16:08,692
<i>So, I don't want to add more
to my plate.</i>

398
00:16:08,689 --> 00:16:12,689
Only God knows where,
you know, he's going
to lead me.

399
00:16:12,689 --> 00:16:15,169
And hopefully, soon I will
find out.

400
00:16:15,172 --> 00:16:17,792
<i>- Gracias, senorita.</i>
- Oh, my gosh.
This is awesome stuff.

401
00:16:17,793 --> 00:16:19,173
[Jose] <i>It is. It is indeed.</i>

402
00:16:20,172 --> 00:16:22,282
- [Joey] Hello, Pola.
- [speaking in Spanish]

403
00:16:22,275 --> 00:16:24,825
- Yeah. How you doing?
- [Pola] Very good. And you?

404
00:16:24,827 --> 00:16:26,897
- I'm doing great.
- [Pola] So...

405
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:28,686
What are you looking for here?

406
00:16:28,689 --> 00:16:30,379
I'm looking
for a great person.

407
00:16:30,379 --> 00:16:32,209
You want, like, older woman?

408
00:16:32,206 --> 00:16:35,616
Yeah. I flirt with them.
You know, I love dancing
with them.

409
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,790
- How old?
- I would say 50 to 60.

410
00:16:37,793 --> 00:16:39,523
- Oh, my God. Okay.
- [Joey] I'm not-- Yeah.
I'm not--

411
00:16:39,517 --> 00:16:41,477
I'm not lying. Especially,
you probably--

412
00:16:41,482 --> 00:16:43,002
You got you that...
you got you that tight body.

413
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,690
You got that slim fit, so...

414
00:16:44,689 --> 00:16:47,689
- Of course, I'd like to see
that body in the sheets.
- [laughs]

415
00:16:47,689 --> 00:16:49,379
Like, how would I not?

416
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:51,379
<i>Pola is very attractive.</i>

417
00:16:51,379 --> 00:16:54,379
Her little accent, yeah,
that's kind of cool, too.
I like that.

418
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:56,279
Maybe I got it from my mom

419
00:16:56,275 --> 00:16:59,685
because she loves herself
a Brazilian accent.

420
00:16:59,689 --> 00:17:02,409
- What I would like to see
in a older woman...
- Uh-huh.

421
00:17:02,413 --> 00:17:06,383
- is her actually not see
me as a child...
- [Pola] Okay.

422
00:17:06,379 --> 00:17:08,379
and see me as an adult.

423
00:17:08,379 --> 00:17:10,279
And what are you going
to show us here?

424
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,410
I-- I'm really going
to show...

425
00:17:13,413 --> 00:17:15,383
how I really am.

426
00:17:15,379 --> 00:17:17,689
I know. But really, what are
you going to show?

427
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:20,899
My speed date with Joey,
it was a disaster.

428
00:17:20,896 --> 00:17:25,476
[speaking in Spanish]

429
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:31,902
- Take care.
- [laughs]

430
00:17:31,896 --> 00:17:33,336
- You, too.
- [laughs]

431
00:17:37,068 --> 00:17:40,278
Wait. Who just took
the Tabasco that I just
brought to the table?

432
00:17:41,931 --> 00:17:44,211
I mean, I want it but I was
just wondering.

433
00:17:44,206 --> 00:17:45,996
- [phone rings and vibrates]
- I got a text!

434
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,380
[all cheering]

435
00:17:49,379 --> 00:17:52,099
Attention, daters.

436
00:17:52,103 --> 00:17:55,073
The results of the chemistry
tests are in.

437
00:17:55,068 --> 00:17:57,378
Some of you are rated
very high,

438
00:17:57,379 --> 00:17:59,279
while others didn't pair
as well.

439
00:17:59,275 --> 00:18:01,095
[all exclaiming]

440
00:18:01,103 --> 00:18:02,483
That's to be expected.

441
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:06,172
The mother and son who ranked
the highest are...

442
00:18:06,172 --> 00:18:09,282
- drum roll.
- [all tapping table]

443
00:18:09,275 --> 00:18:11,475
Pola and Jose!

444
00:18:11,482 --> 00:18:14,522
[all cheering]

445
00:18:14,517 --> 00:18:15,787
I love everybody.

446
00:18:15,793 --> 00:18:17,173
[Pola] Thank you.

447
00:18:17,172 --> 00:18:21,312
It's great to see that people
are as receptive towards us

448
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:24,100
- as we're towards them.
- Yeah. I wasn't... I wasn't
expecting this to happen

449
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,623
but I really feel comfortable

450
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,280
<i>because we like everyone.</i>

451
00:18:27,275 --> 00:18:29,615
<i>And it's good to know
that they like us as well.</i>

452
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,720
- Yeah. For sure.
- So, I'm really happy.

453
00:18:32,172 --> 00:18:33,692
Yay!
[laughs]

454
00:18:33,689 --> 00:18:36,479
Excuse me. I would
like to know who
the lowest is, please.

455
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:37,592
[phone rings and vibrates]

456
00:18:37,586 --> 00:18:38,786
You guys.

457
00:18:38,793 --> 00:18:40,283
I have a text now.

458
00:18:40,275 --> 00:18:42,785
[all cheering]

459
00:18:43,379 --> 00:18:45,099
And now for the bad news.

460
00:18:45,103 --> 00:18:46,343
- [woman 1] Oh.
- [man 1] Oh.

461
00:18:46,344 --> 00:18:49,314
There is one mother and son
that scored the lowest.

462
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:51,930
- Oh.
- And they will be going home.

463
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:52,901
- [woman 2 gasps]
- [woman 3] No.

464
00:18:52,896 --> 00:18:53,856
- [woman 4] What the...
- [woman 5] No.

465
00:18:53,862 --> 00:18:55,282
- [woman 4] What?
- [man 2] Are you serious?

466
00:18:55,275 --> 00:18:56,305
I'm dead serious.

467
00:18:57,413 --> 00:18:59,933
I didn't think anybody
was going home.

468
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:02,896
Oh, God. I'm like,
I'm about to cry.

469
00:19:02,896 --> 00:19:05,376
- [woman 6] Wait.
Are you [bleep]
- [woman 7] Oh!

470
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:16,896
There is one mother and son
that scored the lowest.

471
00:19:16,896 --> 00:19:19,406
- Oh.
- And they will be going home.

472
00:19:19,413 --> 00:19:20,383
- [woman 2 gasps]
- [woman 3] No.

473
00:19:20,379 --> 00:19:21,339
- [woman 4] What the...
- [woman 5] No.

474
00:19:21,344 --> 00:19:22,864
- [woman 4] What?
- [man 2] Are you serious?

475
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:24,762
I'm dead serious.

476
00:19:24,758 --> 00:19:28,518
Somebody's going home.
Like, I didn't even know
that was ever even an option.

477
00:19:28,517 --> 00:19:30,097
So, I'm-- I'm...

478
00:19:31,517 --> 00:19:33,377
I'm just... I'm just shocked.

479
00:19:33,379 --> 00:19:35,169
Oh, God. I'm like,
I'm about to cry.

480
00:19:35,172 --> 00:19:37,282
- [woman 6] Wait.
Are you [bleep]
- [woman 7] Oh!

481
00:19:38,586 --> 00:19:40,586
[Shannan] April and Ricky...

482
00:19:40,586 --> 00:19:43,586
unfortunately the connection
is not quite there

483
00:19:43,586 --> 00:19:45,756
and it's time for you to leave
the villa.

484
00:19:45,758 --> 00:19:48,168
- Oh, my God.
- Wow!

485
00:19:48,172 --> 00:19:50,592
I didn't think that anybody
was leaving.

486
00:19:50,586 --> 00:19:53,276
This is like... Whoo!

487
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,205
- [man 2] I don't think--
- It's not a joke.

488
00:19:56,275 --> 00:19:57,895
Please say your goodbyes.

489
00:19:57,896 --> 00:19:59,276
- [woman 5] What? No.
- [woman 6] Wait. What?

490
00:19:59,275 --> 00:20:00,375
[man 3] No way.

491
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,414
- [man 4] What?
- No.

492
00:20:02,413 --> 00:20:04,213
So, it's not a connection.

493
00:20:04,206 --> 00:20:05,586
It's just shocking.

494
00:20:05,586 --> 00:20:07,896
- No.
- Aw!

495
00:20:09,068 --> 00:20:10,998
[Billy] <i>Ricky and April
are going home.</i>

496
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,380
They didn't really make
an effort to really like...

497
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:16,409
- Connect.
- ...connect with anyone else

498
00:20:16,413 --> 00:20:18,073
other than themselves.

499
00:20:18,068 --> 00:20:20,688
[Soyoung] <i>April is wonderful
but I don't really know her.</i>

500
00:20:20,689 --> 00:20:23,309
Or she's now really
in a group.

501
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:26,380
- And he's not really
there, either.
- Yeah.

502
00:20:26,379 --> 00:20:27,759
- So...
- He didn't want to be there.

503
00:20:27,758 --> 00:20:29,208
They didn't want to be there.

504
00:20:29,206 --> 00:20:30,476
[Ricky] All right. I'm out
of here.

505
00:20:30,482 --> 00:20:33,102
I'm going to my room.
I have no kitty party.

506
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:41,073
[Gabriel] <i>April and Ricky
going home
kind of shocked everyone.</i>

507
00:20:42,206 --> 00:20:43,996
People are kind of scared now,
I think.

508
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,210
So, they're all going to try
and start pumping up
their game.

509
00:20:47,206 --> 00:20:48,586
Everything has changed now.

510
00:20:48,586 --> 00:20:50,276
How do you feel about
the change?

511
00:20:50,275 --> 00:20:51,855
I'm totally fine with it.

512
00:20:51,862 --> 00:20:55,282
The way that I operate is,
if you'd want to be somewhere
don't be there.

513
00:20:55,275 --> 00:20:57,205
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- If that's what you're
gonna do

514
00:20:57,206 --> 00:20:58,756
that's what people
are gonna feel.

515
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,898
- [Charlene] Right.
- And then they won't connect
with you,

516
00:21:00,896 --> 00:21:03,516
and then it's like,
that's what's gonna happen.

517
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
[April W speaking]

518
00:21:10,137 --> 00:21:12,027
[April W] <i>I'm not mad
and I'm not sad.</i>

519
00:21:12,034 --> 00:21:15,384
<i>I'm the same feeling that I am
when I found that we was
dating y'all, shocked.</i>

520
00:21:15,379 --> 00:21:19,099
I think I got a low score
because I came off
very reserved,

521
00:21:19,103 --> 00:21:20,413
<i>so, it was kind of hard</i>

522
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:24,003
to have, like,
a sexual connection
with really anybody.

523
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It was... just weird,
if I had to be honest.

524
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,170
So, I get it.

525
00:21:28,517 --> 00:21:29,787
Jose...

526
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:33,309
[bleep] This... this is real.

527
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:36,900
I mean, that's gonna feel bad,
if I'm in their shoes.

528
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:39,586
I mean, it is shocking
because I didn't know
they were gonna go home.

529
00:21:39,586 --> 00:21:42,756
[April W] Oh, Soyoung.
[laughs]

530
00:21:42,758 --> 00:21:44,968
Don't feel bad, Soyoung.

531
00:21:46,413 --> 00:21:47,623
- [Jose] Love you, man.
- [Ricky] Love you, too, man.

532
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,380
[Pola] <i>Senor,</i> thank you
for everything.

533
00:21:49,379 --> 00:21:50,479
It was a real pleasure.

534
00:21:51,034 --> 00:21:52,794
Yeah. Thank you.

535
00:21:52,793 --> 00:21:55,173
[Jose] <i>Seeing what happened
with April and Ricky,</i>

536
00:21:55,172 --> 00:22:00,482
I realized that chemistry
and finding
that romantic person

537
00:22:00,482 --> 00:22:02,482
in this house
is super important.

538
00:22:02,482 --> 00:22:06,002
- See you, guys!
- [all cheering and applauding]

539
00:22:07,379 --> 00:22:09,689
[Ricky] <i>I'm reserved.
Like, I don't know
how to just open up.</i>

540
00:22:09,689 --> 00:22:12,029
<i>I have to observe the scene
and then I'll open up.</i>

541
00:22:12,034 --> 00:22:13,174
So, it was...

542
00:22:13,172 --> 00:22:15,692
it was actually like,
it was a eye-opener for me.

543
00:22:15,689 --> 00:22:18,759
[April W] <i>Ricky and I came
on this retreat looking
for a partner.</i>

544
00:22:18,758 --> 00:22:21,308
<i>Never thought that would be
so hard to find.</i>

545
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,410
I'm speechless.

546
00:22:24,172 --> 00:22:26,172
- [man 2] Bye, Detroit.
- [man 3] Bye.

547
00:22:26,172 --> 00:22:27,592
Damn! This is crazy.

548
00:22:38,103 --> 00:22:39,593
[Jose] <i>That's a cool spot.</i>

549
00:22:39,586 --> 00:22:41,966
- That is very nice.
- [Jose laughs]

550
00:22:42,482 --> 00:22:43,592
[both sigh]

551
00:22:43,586 --> 00:22:45,476
- This is nice.
- [Jose laughs]
It is indeed.

552
00:22:45,482 --> 00:22:47,862
- This is good. This is good.
- For sure.

553
00:22:47,862 --> 00:22:51,382
<i>I like Soyoung a lot
but Shannan is a very
special woman.</i>

554
00:22:51,379 --> 00:22:56,279
After seeing Ricky and April
leave for not finding
a connection,

555
00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:59,995
I now realize that the main
purpose of this
whole experience

556
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,280
is to look for those
deep connections

557
00:23:02,275 --> 00:23:03,995
and embrace them
and elevate them.

558
00:23:04,896 --> 00:23:07,786
Have you dated women
that are older?

559
00:23:08,896 --> 00:23:10,686
Yeah. She was like...

560
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:11,899
two or three years
older than me.

561
00:23:11,896 --> 00:23:13,516
- [Shannan] Okay.
- Yeah.

562
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:16,787
How do you feel when you see
the exterior of me,
being an older woman?

563
00:23:16,793 --> 00:23:19,173
- I mean, I see your elegance.
- All right.

564
00:23:19,172 --> 00:23:20,522
I'll take that.

565
00:23:20,517 --> 00:23:22,067
[Shannan] <i>Jose is hard
to figure out.</i>

566
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:25,098
I feel like he may give
everyone that kind
of attention.

567
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:26,483
So, you don't know
if you're special.

568
00:23:26,482 --> 00:23:28,592
- Have you dated younger...
- [Shannan] Mmm-hmm.
I have.

569
00:23:28,586 --> 00:23:30,586
You know, I think age ain't
nothing but a number.

570
00:23:30,586 --> 00:23:32,166
I always say that, actually.

571
00:23:32,172 --> 00:23:35,412
It's very important to break
with all those misconceptions
about how--

572
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:37,143
[Shannan] This is true.

573
00:23:37,137 --> 00:23:40,167
- We're supposed to feel or see
ourselves in a certain age.
- [Shannan] Right.

574
00:23:40,172 --> 00:23:41,902
I think that's probably
the most attractive about you

575
00:23:41,896 --> 00:23:43,406
- is the fact that...
- Thank you. Thank you.

576
00:23:43,413 --> 00:23:46,173
...you know, that you have
that insight, you know,
that intellect.

577
00:23:46,172 --> 00:23:47,382
- Appreciate it. Thank you.
- [laughs]

578
00:23:47,379 --> 00:23:48,689
- [Jose] Yeah. I love it.

579
00:23:48,689 --> 00:23:49,759
- Are you blushing?
- Am I?

580
00:23:49,758 --> 00:23:50,998
- I don't know.
- You are blushing.

581
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,620
[Jose] <i>The more I know
and learn from Shannan,</i>

582
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,000
the more I like her.

583
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,100
- And--
- I love her. I love her.

584
00:23:56,103 --> 00:23:57,693
She's very nice. She's...

585
00:23:57,689 --> 00:24:00,409
She's very smart and also
she's quite.

586
00:24:00,413 --> 00:24:01,693
- Yes.
- She doesn't scream.

587
00:24:01,689 --> 00:24:04,309
- A very soft voice. Yeah.
- Soft. Yeah.

588
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,900
And you know what I like
about her?

589
00:24:05,896 --> 00:24:08,166
<i>How she talks to her son.</i>

590
00:24:08,172 --> 00:24:11,172
- They have a very nice
relationship between them.
- Yeah.

591
00:24:11,172 --> 00:24:12,592
- What are you looking for?
- [Shannan] Um...

592
00:24:12,586 --> 00:24:13,996
In life-- Like, in general.

593
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,690
I do just have just one life.

594
00:24:16,586 --> 00:24:18,896
And I want to make the most
of it.

595
00:24:18,896 --> 00:24:20,586
And there's a saying
in Spanish.

596
00:24:20,586 --> 00:24:21,856
[speaking in Spanish]

597
00:24:21,862 --> 00:24:22,902
[Shannan] Dude, that
sounds sexy.

598
00:24:22,896 --> 00:24:24,786
What does that mean?
[laughs]

599
00:24:24,793 --> 00:24:28,173
That-- it's basically that
nobody takes your experience
from you.

600
00:24:28,172 --> 00:24:29,592
Mmm. That's hot.

601
00:24:30,482 --> 00:24:31,482
<i>I like Jose.</i>

602
00:24:31,482 --> 00:24:33,792
<i>So, I am trying to figure out</i>

603
00:24:33,793 --> 00:24:37,033
<i>what exactly is going to get
him to that next level.</i>

604
00:24:37,034 --> 00:24:39,034
I have been married twice.

605
00:24:39,034 --> 00:24:42,414
And when it comes to dating
in between marriages,

606
00:24:42,413 --> 00:24:45,523
I will say that my attention
span has been a little short.

607
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:48,277
<i>But I feel like I have
a connection with Jose.</i>

608
00:24:48,275 --> 00:24:49,375
<i>He has my attention.</i>

609
00:25:01,517 --> 00:25:03,277
Wait.

610
00:25:03,275 --> 00:25:05,515
- [sighs]
I got it.
- Don't make us fall.

611
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,380
I'm trying to.

612
00:25:09,068 --> 00:25:10,758
[sighs]
This is good.

613
00:25:10,758 --> 00:25:12,278
Whoo-wee!

614
00:25:12,275 --> 00:25:13,755
- [Gabriel] You get comfy.
Lay down.
- [Stefany] You took my--

615
00:25:15,586 --> 00:25:17,896
What's your favorite part
of this trip so far?

616
00:25:17,896 --> 00:25:18,966
- Just meeting--
- Besides me.

617
00:25:18,965 --> 00:25:20,585
Oh, besides you.
[laughs]

618
00:25:20,586 --> 00:25:21,756
Just meeting everyone.

619
00:25:22,068 --> 00:25:22,968
I think...

620
00:25:22,965 --> 00:25:24,895
- It's fun, huh?
- It's been fun. Yes.

621
00:25:24,896 --> 00:25:26,476
[Gabriel] Are you comfy?
Or are you falling?

622
00:25:26,482 --> 00:25:27,412
Put your legs.

623
00:25:27,413 --> 00:25:28,793
I'm perfect.

624
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:30,523
I'm perfect, too.
So, we're good.

625
00:25:30,517 --> 00:25:32,307
We're perfect.
[laughs]

626
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:34,380
- [Gabriel] So funny.
- [Stefany] Oh, my goodness.

627
00:25:35,172 --> 00:25:36,382
- Ryan!
- [Ryan] What's up?

628
00:25:36,379 --> 00:25:38,099
Do you play any, like,
instruments and [bleep]?

629
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:41,103
I play some violin
and play some piano by ear.

630
00:25:41,103 --> 00:25:43,173
Could we get a little
grand piano?

631
00:25:43,172 --> 00:25:44,412
[laughs] That's good.

632
00:25:44,413 --> 00:25:45,903
You want to stay here, too?

633
00:25:45,896 --> 00:25:48,166
Stefany, offer him a spot,
I'm out.

634
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,480
[both laughing]

635
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:52,002
[Stefany] Did you hear him?

636
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,480
This is like a weird case
of, like, actions and words
not matching.

637
00:25:55,482 --> 00:25:57,002
So, I'm confused
at this point.

638
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,590
Like, how am I your favorite?

639
00:25:58,586 --> 00:26:01,476
And if you're telling somebody
that they're strictly,

640
00:26:01,482 --> 00:26:02,592
clearly just a friend,

641
00:26:02,586 --> 00:26:04,206
and they know their position,

642
00:26:04,206 --> 00:26:05,896
then why is he moving the way
he's moving?

643
00:26:06,517 --> 00:26:07,517
You know.

644
00:26:08,517 --> 00:26:10,857
We're two perfect people.
[laughs]

645
00:26:10,862 --> 00:26:13,072
- We're two gorgeous, gorgeous,
gorgeous girls.
- Yeah.

646
00:26:13,068 --> 00:26:15,618
[laughs]
Yes. Yes.

647
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:18,280
- [Gabriel] We're just friends.
- We're friends.

648
00:26:18,275 --> 00:26:19,785
[both laughing]

649
00:26:21,482 --> 00:26:23,412
It's very annoying
where Gabriel is.

650
00:26:23,413 --> 00:26:25,003
Too overbearing.

651
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,310
I don't wanna get him upset.

652
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:28,280
I don't want to get you upset.

653
00:26:28,275 --> 00:26:29,785
You gotta draw that line

654
00:26:29,793 --> 00:26:31,793
or nothing else will
really develop.

655
00:26:33,689 --> 00:26:34,859
[Stefany] Billy!

656
00:26:34,862 --> 00:26:36,482
[Kelle] <i>Billy and I are
turning up the heat.</i>

657
00:26:36,482 --> 00:26:37,482
Do you not knock?

658
00:26:37,482 --> 00:26:38,902
[Stefany] Oh, yeah.
Kelle, you got to go.

659
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,380
We should get in the hot tub.

660
00:26:46,379 --> 00:26:48,969
Do you want to get into
Pola's and Jose's?

661
00:26:48,965 --> 00:26:51,785
The one in their room is...

662
00:26:51,793 --> 00:26:53,593
it doesn't turn on. Remember?

663
00:26:53,586 --> 00:26:55,026
Let's try.

664
00:26:55,034 --> 00:26:57,794
The speed dating thing
was kind of buzz for me.

665
00:26:57,793 --> 00:27:02,003
I didn't have any new matches
but I am here to find love.

666
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,790
<i>So, since Billy and I had
a little connection
on our date on the beach,</i>

667
00:27:06,793 --> 00:27:08,483
I think we need to turn up
the heat.

668
00:27:10,793 --> 00:27:12,003
I'm jealous of your feet.

669
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,280
- Oh!
- They're very arched.

670
00:27:13,275 --> 00:27:14,475
Look how flat my feet are.

671
00:27:15,068 --> 00:27:16,138
It's flat, flat.

672
00:27:17,758 --> 00:27:18,898
Damn! Look at that.

673
00:27:18,896 --> 00:27:19,896
That's what I'm saying
you got.

674
00:27:19,896 --> 00:27:21,686
You come over,
you can see your toes.

675
00:27:21,689 --> 00:27:23,789
- I just spread my toes.
- [Ryan] Oh, look at all
your moves.

676
00:27:23,793 --> 00:27:25,033
You're a little duck!

677
00:27:26,551 --> 00:27:28,591
[Stefany speaking]

678
00:27:29,896 --> 00:27:31,546
[Ryan]
Did he kick you out?

679
00:27:31,551 --> 00:27:34,451
- He didn't text you?
- No one's kicking me out
of my room.

680
00:27:34,448 --> 00:27:36,588
[Ryan] <i>I mean, you have like
three rooms in one room.</i>

681
00:27:36,586 --> 00:27:38,166
- That's true.
- [Ryan] I think you're good.

682
00:27:38,172 --> 00:27:42,482
So, Gabriel says he was going
to take me out on a date.
That was--

683
00:27:42,482 --> 00:27:43,662
Of course, he does.

684
00:27:43,655 --> 00:27:45,685
It's very annoying where
Gabriel is.

685
00:27:45,689 --> 00:27:51,029
You know, too overbearing
when it comes to Gabriel.

686
00:27:51,034 --> 00:27:53,174
I feel like he never leaves.

687
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:56,342
Seriously. He just
is always there.

688
00:27:56,344 --> 00:28:00,864
The degree of separation
with Stefany is none.

689
00:28:00,862 --> 00:28:02,762
<i>So, I have to create
some separation</i>

690
00:28:02,758 --> 00:28:05,588
just to see if it's a fit
or not a fit, you know.

691
00:28:05,586 --> 00:28:08,996
I think what bothers
me is the lack
of respecting boundaries.

692
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,760
Like, if I'm sitting
with you at the pool
right now,

693
00:28:10,758 --> 00:28:12,588
like, he'll, like, come back
and come over and be, like,

694
00:28:12,586 --> 00:28:14,166
-"Hey, Stef."
- Oh.

695
00:28:14,172 --> 00:28:15,792
Like, bro, like stop.

696
00:28:15,793 --> 00:28:18,383
- You know what
I'm saying. Like...
- I get it.

697
00:28:18,379 --> 00:28:20,689
[April J] <i>Gabriel had been
hanging out with Stefany
the whole time.</i>

698
00:28:20,689 --> 00:28:23,069
And Ryan was kind of looking
out for himself going,
you know,

699
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:24,758
"Who am I going to be with?"

700
00:28:24,758 --> 00:28:27,168
And he started competing
with my kid.

701
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:28,622
<i>And Ryan's cool.</i>

702
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:32,380
But, you know, if somebody's
going to start messing
with my son,

703
00:28:32,379 --> 00:28:36,789
you know, I'm always going
to be there on Gabriel's side.

704
00:28:36,793 --> 00:28:38,693
[Stefany] I think we gravitate
to each other

705
00:28:38,689 --> 00:28:42,379
because we've developed
that strong connection
from the beginning

706
00:28:42,379 --> 00:28:43,969
as friends, you know.

707
00:28:47,586 --> 00:28:50,066
[Stefany] He's always
hanging out in the room
with Billy

708
00:28:50,068 --> 00:28:53,998
and everyone's up there
and I don't want to get
him upset.

709
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,590
I don't want to get you upset.

710
00:28:55,586 --> 00:29:00,096
You gotta draw that line
or nothing else will
really develop.

711
00:29:00,103 --> 00:29:02,453
<i>At this point, Gabriel is just
being a</i> [bleep].

712
00:29:02,448 --> 00:29:03,968
<i>That's not really my style.</i>

713
00:29:03,965 --> 00:29:08,855
I have done more than my part,
um, at just respect
them boundaries

714
00:29:08,862 --> 00:29:12,002
<i>and respecting when
it's my time and when
it's not my time.</i>

715
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,450
I know Gabriel feels
threatened by me.

716
00:29:14,448 --> 00:29:16,788
And I will feel threatened
by me, too.

717
00:29:16,793 --> 00:29:18,793
I'm thinking of waking up
at five o'clock
in the morning.

718
00:29:18,793 --> 00:29:20,283
- You are?
- [Ryan] Yes. I am.

719
00:29:20,275 --> 00:29:22,755
My plan. You should wake up
and you should come see, like,

720
00:29:22,758 --> 00:29:25,588
- the sunrise
and all the lights...
- At five thirty?

721
00:29:25,586 --> 00:29:27,656
I can get up at five.
What time is it now?

722
00:29:27,655 --> 00:29:28,755
- Ten fifteen.
- [Stefany] Oh.

723
00:29:28,758 --> 00:29:30,138
- Ten fifteen.
- [Ryan] Yeah.

724
00:29:30,137 --> 00:29:31,787
- You're not going to wake up.
Wanna bet?
- [Stefany] No.

725
00:29:31,793 --> 00:29:33,593
No. As a matter of fact,
let's make a bet.

726
00:29:33,586 --> 00:29:36,166
Gabriel can't come to your
room for one solid day.

727
00:29:36,172 --> 00:29:37,792
[laughs]
Oh, my God!

728
00:29:37,793 --> 00:29:39,483
- I get a full day.
- [Stefany laughing]

729
00:29:39,482 --> 00:29:41,592
- Why is Gabriel in this bet?
- Huh?

730
00:29:41,586 --> 00:29:42,996
- 'Cause.
- [Stefany] You're so...

731
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,240
[Ryan] It's a bet. It's a bet.

732
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:45,971
I get a full day
of communication.

733
00:29:45,965 --> 00:29:47,785
He hangs out with Billy.

734
00:29:47,793 --> 00:29:50,103
I mean, that's fine.
Billy gets to hang out
with him.

735
00:29:50,103 --> 00:29:52,763
Both Gabriel and Ryan
are great guys.

736
00:29:52,758 --> 00:29:55,588
But right now, I feel a little
pressured by Ryan.

737
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:58,786
<i>I'm not really sure
how to respond
to a situation like this.</i>

738
00:29:58,793 --> 00:30:05,143
Making a bet with me to keep
Gabriel away, it just makes
me feel uncomfortable.

739
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:07,477
I think it could be a little
bit manipulative.

740
00:30:07,482 --> 00:30:09,592
- Okay. I'll be up at five.
You have your bet.
- All right.

741
00:30:09,586 --> 00:30:11,996
Gabriel gets no time
for 24-hours

742
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
and he can't-- he can't come
in the room. You get it?

743
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,590
[both laughing]

744
00:30:15,586 --> 00:30:17,786
[Ryan] <i>I make a silly bet
with Stefany,</i>

745
00:30:17,793 --> 00:30:20,073
we'll go watch the sunset
or something like that,

746
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,898
very early, five o'clock,

747
00:30:21,896 --> 00:30:23,446
if you're not up, though,

748
00:30:24,103 --> 00:30:26,383
you have to last 24-hours

749
00:30:27,103 --> 00:30:28,483
<i>without Gabriel.</i>

750
00:30:28,482 --> 00:30:30,382
I think the odds are stacked
in my favor.

751
00:30:30,965 --> 00:30:32,895
[Stefany] Bed-time...

752
00:30:32,896 --> 00:30:34,686
I got to get up at five
or else...

753
00:30:34,689 --> 00:30:36,139
[Ryan laughs]

754
00:30:36,137 --> 00:30:38,137
You're so bad.

755
00:30:38,137 --> 00:30:39,097
[Ryan] Ain't I terrible?

756
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:51,339
Billy and I had a great
first date.

757
00:30:51,344 --> 00:30:53,594
And now, he's setting up this,

758
00:30:53,586 --> 00:30:58,376
uh, romantic hot tub session
in Pola and Jose's room,

759
00:30:58,379 --> 00:31:00,899
so his mom can't be creeping
in on us.

760
00:31:00,896 --> 00:31:03,276
- Hey...
- [Billy] Hi.

761
00:31:04,379 --> 00:31:06,589
- [Kelle] Oh, it's less
than cold.
- [laughs]

762
00:31:06,586 --> 00:31:07,896
[Kelle] The way I love it.

763
00:31:13,586 --> 00:31:15,586
Oh, my God.

764
00:31:16,896 --> 00:31:18,686
Oh, my God. It's so hot.

765
00:31:20,551 --> 00:31:21,551
Whoa!

766
00:31:21,551 --> 00:31:22,761
[Billy] It's getting
warmer, though.

767
00:31:24,103 --> 00:31:26,693
I have candles all lined up.

768
00:31:26,689 --> 00:31:27,789
- [Kelle] Yeah.
- And everything.

769
00:31:27,793 --> 00:31:29,553
But the wind kept
blowing them out.

770
00:31:29,551 --> 00:31:30,691
[both laughing]

771
00:31:32,689 --> 00:31:35,069
[Billy] 'Cause I can't [bleep]
[bleep] wait.

772
00:31:35,068 --> 00:31:37,238
[laughing]

773
00:31:37,241 --> 00:31:40,001
It was like so nice
and pretty, like, there on--

774
00:31:47,793 --> 00:31:49,763
[Kelle] <i>I'm really hoping
that I get to see</i>

775
00:31:49,758 --> 00:31:52,968
if his size of his [bleep]
is real big.

776
00:31:53,241 --> 00:31:55,381
[laughs]

777
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,900
[Billy speaking]

778
00:32:14,862 --> 00:32:17,282
This hot tub
is freezing and...

779
00:32:17,275 --> 00:32:21,445
unfortunately the only other
hot tub I could use is...

780
00:32:21,448 --> 00:32:23,138
<i>the one in our suite.</i>

781
00:32:23,137 --> 00:32:25,447
<i>I don't really like the idea
of bringing someone
back to my room</i>

782
00:32:25,448 --> 00:32:28,898
with my mom being around,
but what else am I supposed
to do?

783
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,140
[Kelle] Oh, my--
[screams]

784
00:32:34,758 --> 00:32:36,028
[laughs]

785
00:32:36,034 --> 00:32:39,284
[both laughing]

786
00:32:39,275 --> 00:32:43,475
I think anyone that is able
to laugh about themselves

787
00:32:43,482 --> 00:32:47,172
is definitely someone
that I would want to date.

788
00:32:47,172 --> 00:32:49,482
<i>Like, if you take yourself
too seriously, like...</i>

789
00:32:50,379 --> 00:32:51,689
that's no good for me.

790
00:32:54,482 --> 00:32:56,282
Why are you so far away?

791
00:32:56,275 --> 00:32:57,785
You scared your mom's going
to come in?

792
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:08,475
I feel like I'm a teenager
again with Billy,

793
00:33:08,482 --> 00:33:11,282
<i>sneaking around the whole
house hiding, from his mom.</i>

794
00:33:11,275 --> 00:33:14,165
Billy's definitely going to be
put in time out after this.

795
00:33:14,172 --> 00:33:15,282
<i>Sorry, Mom.</i>

796
00:33:15,275 --> 00:33:17,335
[laughs]

797
00:33:17,344 --> 00:33:19,974
- Whose are these?
- [Billy laughs]

798
00:33:19,965 --> 00:33:21,275
- Whose are these?
- [Billy]

799
00:33:21,275 --> 00:33:22,995
[Kelle and Billy laughing]

800
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,550
[indistinct conversation]

801
00:33:35,551 --> 00:33:36,381
Yo...

802
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,280
- [laughs]
- Where?

803
00:33:40,275 --> 00:33:41,275
In your room.

804
00:33:41,275 --> 00:33:42,965
No. I'm gonna go in there.

805
00:33:42,965 --> 00:33:45,135
- No. Don't.
- [Ryan] No. No. No. You can't.

806
00:33:45,137 --> 00:33:47,027
- [Gabriel] No. No. Don't.
- [Ryan] You can't mess up
their ...

807
00:33:47,034 --> 00:33:49,284
[Ryan speaking]

808
00:33:49,275 --> 00:33:53,585
There is no way I'm gonna let
Kelle corrupt Billy.

809
00:33:53,586 --> 00:33:58,686
I don't know if she's just
trying to push my buttons
or what her deal is.

810
00:33:58,689 --> 00:34:01,589
But, yeah. Definitely,
definitely not here.

811
00:34:01,586 --> 00:34:03,026
Not in my suite.

812
00:34:03,034 --> 00:34:04,554
I'm gonna be like,
you gotta go.

813
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,380
Billy.

814
00:34:21,379 --> 00:34:22,379
Oh, yeah.

815
00:34:22,379 --> 00:34:24,589
Really? In our sauna?

816
00:34:24,586 --> 00:34:26,546
Don't you have your own room?

817
00:34:36,137 --> 00:34:39,277
Whether she likes it or not,
Billy and I are turning up
the heat.

818
00:34:39,275 --> 00:34:41,165
<i>Tonight, we're sleeping
in the same bed</i>

819
00:34:41,172 --> 00:34:43,382
and she needs to stop [bleep]
blocking him.

820
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:44,899
[indistinct chatter]

821
00:34:44,896 --> 00:34:46,546
[doorbell rings]

822
00:34:47,551 --> 00:34:50,071
[all screaming]

823
00:34:50,068 --> 00:34:51,168
It just got real.

824
00:34:51,275 --> 00:34:52,755
No. No.

825
00:34:58,965 --> 00:35:00,275
[Stefany] <i>Oh, yeah.
Kelle, you got to go.</i>

826
00:35:00,275 --> 00:35:02,685
[Kelle] We just got here.
Well, come in.

827
00:35:02,689 --> 00:35:04,279
[Stefany] No. I'll be back.

828
00:35:04,275 --> 00:35:06,755
[Kelle] That's okay.
Don't come back. We're fine.

829
00:35:06,758 --> 00:35:10,588
Oh! That's your mom.
[laughs]

830
00:35:10,586 --> 00:35:13,236
Stefany's popping into
the sauna unannounced,

831
00:35:13,241 --> 00:35:14,791
I feel like it's a little
bit ridiculous

832
00:35:14,793 --> 00:35:17,003
since her son is, like,
in his late 20's.

833
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,280
<i>I know you all live together,
but do you not knock?</i>

834
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,280
Whether she likes it or not,
Billy and I are turning up
the heat.

835
00:35:25,275 --> 00:35:26,965
<i>Tonight, we're sleeping
in the same bed</i>

836
00:35:26,965 --> 00:35:29,375
and she needs to stop [bleep]
blocking him.

837
00:35:36,793 --> 00:35:38,343
[Gabriel] Where's Billy?

838
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:39,344
Billy!

839
00:35:40,689 --> 00:35:42,689
Your new step-dad's here.

840
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:47,973
You are?

841
00:35:49,344 --> 00:35:50,174
[Gabriel] Yeah.

842
00:35:52,689 --> 00:35:53,929
What is?

843
00:36:07,344 --> 00:36:08,554
- You're not gonna wake up
at five.
- [Stefany] At five?

844
00:36:08,551 --> 00:36:09,691
[Stefany laughs]

845
00:36:09,689 --> 00:36:11,479
[Gabriel] You're joking.

846
00:36:11,482 --> 00:36:13,692
Someone attractive,
being controlling and stuff,

847
00:36:13,689 --> 00:36:16,479
I felt like Ryan was
kind of being
a little controlling.

848
00:36:16,482 --> 00:36:18,662
<i>Like, telling Stefany,
wake up at 5:00 a.m.</i>

849
00:36:18,655 --> 00:36:22,685
If you don't, you can't be
around Gabriel for 24-hours.

850
00:36:22,689 --> 00:36:26,069
And I was like, that's such
a weird way of looking
at things.

851
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,662
I don't want to be
an overbearing mom.

852
00:36:40,655 --> 00:36:42,205
But I just...

853
00:36:42,206 --> 00:36:47,376
don't like the fact that
Kelle's like six-feet away
from me in your bed.

854
00:36:47,379 --> 00:36:51,239
I think I'm gonna be sleeping
with one eye open tonight.

855
00:36:51,241 --> 00:36:53,341
I think you're being a little
bit too overprotective.

856
00:36:59,068 --> 00:37:00,788
[Billy] Please don't
wake up at five?

857
00:37:00,793 --> 00:37:03,663
I swear to God, if you do
this it's dumb.

858
00:37:03,655 --> 00:37:05,275
- It's like giving--
- [Billy] It's so dumb.

859
00:37:05,275 --> 00:37:07,065
Billy, isn't it giving
into it, too?

860
00:37:07,068 --> 00:37:08,788
[Billy] Yeah. That's so dumb.

861
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:10,173
Maybe, she likes it.

862
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,900
[bleep]

863
00:37:14,172 --> 00:37:15,902
[Stefany laughs]
Excuse me?

864
00:37:15,896 --> 00:37:17,096
Turn it off.

865
00:37:17,103 --> 00:37:19,593
I'm not waking. I can't have
an alarm go off at five.

866
00:37:20,482 --> 00:37:21,452
[sighs]

867
00:37:36,689 --> 00:37:38,449
[Kelle snoring]

868
00:37:42,275 --> 00:37:44,135
Kelle had been drinking

869
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:46,897
- Yes.
- and she started hiccupping,

870
00:37:46,896 --> 00:37:49,276
- [laughs] Yes.
- she started snoring
really loud.

871
00:37:49,275 --> 00:37:50,475
So loud.

872
00:37:50,482 --> 00:37:51,762
[Kelle snoring]

873
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,685
I was, like, in my mom's bed,
like, as a little kid.

874
00:37:59,689 --> 00:38:02,479
It like, brought back
memories, like,
hiding from the monster.

875
00:38:02,482 --> 00:38:03,592
[both laugh]

876
00:38:03,586 --> 00:38:05,376
[snoring]

877
00:38:16,344 --> 00:38:19,664
<i>Me and Stefany, we made
a small bet.</i>

878
00:38:19,655 --> 00:38:21,855
<i>I wake up this morning,
go upstairs...</i>

879
00:38:21,862 --> 00:38:23,002
[knocking at door]

880
00:38:26,793 --> 00:38:28,283
[Ryan] <i>Of course,
she doesn't answer.</i>

881
00:38:28,275 --> 00:38:29,895
If I'm just being transparent,

882
00:38:29,896 --> 00:38:31,896
<i>the way I stack the bet is...</i>

883
00:38:31,896 --> 00:38:34,786
I still get the time with
you if you wake up on time.

884
00:38:34,793 --> 00:38:38,593
But if you lose, I still get
the time with you, regardless.

885
00:38:38,586 --> 00:38:40,586
<i>Let's see if Stefany
will pay up.</i>

886
00:38:52,103 --> 00:38:55,693
- Hi, Shannan.
- [Shannan] Hi.
What are you up to?

887
00:38:55,689 --> 00:38:59,339
[Billy] Just rinsing out my...

888
00:38:59,344 --> 00:39:01,174
- glass.
- [Shannan] Having your
afternoon beverage?

889
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,072
Yeah.

890
00:39:02,896 --> 00:39:03,896
You look nice.

891
00:39:03,896 --> 00:39:05,376
- Thank you. Thank you.
- How was your date?

892
00:39:05,379 --> 00:39:06,859
[Shannan] Oh, that's what
I wanted to talk to you about.

893
00:39:06,862 --> 00:39:10,172
'Cause I had a really nice
time with Jose.

894
00:39:10,172 --> 00:39:13,172
I know that, you know,
you guys talk or whatever,

895
00:39:13,172 --> 00:39:16,102
like, can you, like,
shed any light on, like,

896
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:18,593
who he might be really
interested in?

897
00:39:18,586 --> 00:39:21,336
Is he your, uh,
number one prospect?

898
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:24,174
He is. But I need him to know
I'm different than
everybody else.

899
00:39:24,172 --> 00:39:26,172
- Do you know what I mean?
- [Billy] Yeah. You don't want
to feel that on--

900
00:39:26,172 --> 00:39:28,862
Yeah. I think he's like that
with, like, everyone.

901
00:39:28,862 --> 00:39:32,482
I haven't had too much
of a conversation
with him about that.

902
00:39:32,482 --> 00:39:35,972
- I think Jose is kind of just
really suave.
- [Stefany] So just charming.

903
00:39:35,965 --> 00:39:37,375
- Yeah.
- And kind of...

904
00:39:37,379 --> 00:39:40,689
- A charmer.
- Charming everyone,
and kind of just,

905
00:39:40,689 --> 00:39:44,169
- uh, planting his seed
in every department.
- [laughs]

906
00:39:44,172 --> 00:39:45,342
- Uh...
- Oh, my gosh.

907
00:39:45,344 --> 00:39:47,384
I think he's just being
Rico Suave.

908
00:39:47,379 --> 00:39:48,789
Oh, [bleep]

909
00:39:48,793 --> 00:39:50,553
Let me just put it out there.

910
00:39:50,551 --> 00:39:53,481
You know, I kind of heard
you, you know, had a nice
time with Kelle.

911
00:39:53,482 --> 00:39:54,662
[laughs]

912
00:39:54,655 --> 00:39:56,165
[Shannan] So, I'm like,
I was trying to figure out

913
00:39:56,172 --> 00:40:00,032
what is it that, you know,
would make you click
with older women.

914
00:40:00,034 --> 00:40:02,074
And I think last time
just happened.

915
00:40:02,068 --> 00:40:04,338
- Um... we...
- Yeah. What happened?

916
00:40:04,344 --> 00:40:07,454
- We got together
in the sauna and--
- Are you serious?

917
00:40:07,448 --> 00:40:09,688
- Really?
- [Billy] Yeah. We we had
a great time.

918
00:40:09,689 --> 00:40:10,689
- Oh, my God.
- [Billy] Yeah.

919
00:40:10,689 --> 00:40:12,029
Like, together, together?

920
00:40:12,758 --> 00:40:14,548
Not-- Yeah.

921
00:40:14,551 --> 00:40:15,901
Did she keep her hands
to herself?

922
00:40:15,896 --> 00:40:17,446
- [Billy stammers]
- I don't worry about you.

923
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:18,518
- [laughs]
- [Billy] We kind of...

924
00:40:18,517 --> 00:40:21,067
- We were snuggling, and, uh...
- [Shannan] Uh-huh.

925
00:40:21,068 --> 00:40:22,378
Is that all y'all were doing?

926
00:40:25,379 --> 00:40:27,379
What I was hoping for...

927
00:40:27,379 --> 00:40:31,339
was just to be able
to figure out how to get
to the next level.

928
00:40:31,344 --> 00:40:33,554
Or maybe you take
the initiative.

929
00:40:33,551 --> 00:40:36,071
Like, you go in for what
you want,

930
00:40:36,068 --> 00:40:39,588
- Mmm. You think so?
- and kind of see how he reacts
to that.

931
00:40:39,586 --> 00:40:41,276
Maybe just go for it.

932
00:40:41,275 --> 00:40:42,785
- You know what?
That's a good approach.
- [Billy] Yeah.

933
00:40:42,793 --> 00:40:44,313
- [Shannan] <i>I like that.</i>
- [Billy] <i>Yeah.</i>

934
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:57,694
I sing and I have my own band.
It's called April Jayne
and The Players.

935
00:40:57,689 --> 00:40:59,689
[all cheering]

936
00:40:59,689 --> 00:41:00,689
Like... like all of you.

937
00:41:01,689 --> 00:41:03,899
And when we go back to L.A.,

938
00:41:03,896 --> 00:41:06,136
- I play on Sunset Strip,
- [Soyoung] I'm coming.

939
00:41:06,137 --> 00:41:08,997
- [Charlene] Awesome.
- all over, like, Hollywood,
different places.

940
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,070
You guys have to come.

941
00:41:10,068 --> 00:41:11,238
- Yeah.
- We sure have to.

942
00:41:11,241 --> 00:41:12,341
[Jimmy] I'm gonna
bring everybody.

943
00:41:14,965 --> 00:41:17,585
My musicians are, mwah.

944
00:41:19,586 --> 00:41:22,856
- [Jose] Back stage passes?
- Yes. Back stage
passes, autographs...

945
00:41:22,862 --> 00:41:24,482
- [man 4] All right.
- [indistinct chatter]

946
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:25,662
[doorbell rings]

947
00:41:28,448 --> 00:41:29,998
[all screaming]

948
00:41:31,034 --> 00:41:32,974
What the hell is going on?

949
00:41:32,965 --> 00:41:34,585
- [all cheering]
- No.

950
00:41:34,586 --> 00:41:35,686
It just got real.

951
00:41:38,448 --> 00:41:39,658
Okay.

952
00:41:39,655 --> 00:41:42,475
It's time for some sex ed.

953
00:41:43,896 --> 00:41:48,136
Since older women definitely
are more advanced
in the bedroom,

954
00:41:48,137 --> 00:41:49,687
we can teach...

955
00:41:49,689 --> 00:41:51,169
- [scoffs]
- a few things.

956
00:41:51,172 --> 00:41:52,932
[both laughing]

957
00:41:52,931 --> 00:41:56,901
[Shannan] Demonstrate
your go-to foreplay technique
on one of these fruits.

958
00:41:58,068 --> 00:41:58,898
[Gabriel] Okay.

959
00:42:00,172 --> 00:42:01,762
[all exclaiming]

960
00:42:01,758 --> 00:42:03,788
Because...
[laughs]

961
00:42:04,896 --> 00:42:06,756
[Stefany] I'm out. I can't
sit there.

962
00:42:06,758 --> 00:42:08,028
[Jose] Go, go, go.

963
00:42:08,896 --> 00:42:12,966
Today is the day that
I'm gonna make Jose
to be my man.

964
00:42:14,862 --> 00:42:16,382
[Jose] <i>Having her by my side,</i>

965
00:42:16,379 --> 00:42:18,999
definitely brought
us closer together.

966
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,590
[Shannan] <i>Don't tell me
you like hanging out
with my son</i>

967
00:42:20,586 --> 00:42:22,476
<i>but you're sleeping
with somebody else's son.</i>

968
00:42:22,482 --> 00:42:24,692
There are mixed signals
going both ways

969
00:42:24,689 --> 00:42:26,339
- because what's happening...
- There's not.

970
00:42:26,344 --> 00:42:28,074
He's talking to me
with his mom.

971
00:42:28,068 --> 00:42:30,588
I think your feelings are hurt
because she doesn't like you.

972
00:42:30,586 --> 00:42:31,756
Then why did she kiss
me on the beach,

973
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:33,478
telling me that she doesn't
[bleep] with you [bleep].

974
00:42:33,482 --> 00:42:35,172
Ryan, you're so disrespectful.

975
00:42:35,172 --> 00:42:37,902
- You're a liar. No. No. You--
- I'm too old to be dealing
with this.
