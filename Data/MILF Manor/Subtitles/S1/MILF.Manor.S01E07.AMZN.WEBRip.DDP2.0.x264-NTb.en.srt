00:00:01,586 --> 00:00:03,966
[woman] <i>Previously
on</i> MILF Manor...

2
00:00:03,965 --> 00:00:05,965
[Billy] <i>Kelle doesn't really
mind PDA.</i>

3
00:00:05,965 --> 00:00:07,165
<i>But with my mom being around,</i>

4
00:00:07,172 --> 00:00:08,282
<i>it's a little weird.</i>

5
00:00:08,275 --> 00:00:11,275
I definitely am not enjoying
this one bit.

6
00:00:11,275 --> 00:00:12,995
<i>She could tone it down
a little bit.</i>

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,520
Oh, my goodness.
I can't watch.

8
00:00:15,517 --> 00:00:17,097
[Kelle] <i>I said,
take it off, Billy.</i>

9
00:00:17,103 --> 00:00:18,003
[Billy chuckles]

10
00:00:19,413 --> 00:00:20,483
[Billy] I don't think
I can stay here.

11
00:00:20,482 --> 00:00:22,862
I don't really like
the comfort of this bed.

12
00:00:22,862 --> 00:00:25,452
[Kelle] <i>I just don't have time
to play games.</i>

13
00:00:25,448 --> 00:00:27,308
But if you wanna go
sleep with your mom...

14
00:00:27,896 --> 00:00:28,716
enjoy.

15
00:00:29,034 --> 00:00:30,524
[Kelle]

16
00:00:30,517 --> 00:00:32,337
Every time I'm close to you...

17
00:00:32,344 --> 00:00:33,454
- [Ryan] Okay.
- You're looking at me.

18
00:00:33,896 --> 00:00:34,996
Lot of passion.

19
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,140
I really feel a connection
with him.

20
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:38,277
<i>This is the guy.</i>

21
00:00:38,275 --> 00:00:40,135
<i>- Salud</i> to life.
<i>- Salud</i> to life.

22
00:00:40,137 --> 00:00:42,827
If you could put
sunscreen on me.

23
00:00:42,827 --> 00:00:44,547
[Joey] <i>The lower arms...</i>

24
00:00:44,551 --> 00:00:47,311
<i>A little massage
along with it.</i>

25
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:48,970
Oh, I love it.

26
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:50,995
[April] <i>Out of all
the young men in the house,</i>

27
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,450
I'm sort of gravitating
to the youngest guy.

28
00:00:57,551 --> 00:00:58,621
You're really special.

29
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,790
- You're special!
- Thank you.

30
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:02,453
Jose gives me a lot of
butterflies and nervous

31
00:01:02,448 --> 00:01:04,758
and I get giggle
and I don't know what to do.

32
00:01:04,758 --> 00:01:05,828
[kisses]

33
00:01:05,827 --> 00:01:08,337
How do you feel when you
see the exterior of me?

34
00:01:08,344 --> 00:01:09,764
I mean, I see your elegance.

35
00:01:09,758 --> 00:01:11,448
- That's hot.
- [Shannan] <i>I like Jose.</i>

36
00:01:11,448 --> 00:01:12,928
<i>He's my one and only.</i>

37
00:01:12,931 --> 00:01:14,211
He has my attention.

38
00:01:17,448 --> 00:01:19,168
But we would
have to sneak out.

39
00:01:19,172 --> 00:01:20,932
I know that Jose
has been dating

40
00:01:20,931 --> 00:01:22,171
a lot of women in the house,

41
00:01:22,172 --> 00:01:23,072
<i>but tonight,</i>

42
00:01:23,068 --> 00:01:24,238
<i>I'm gonna show him that</i>

43
00:01:24,241 --> 00:01:25,591
I'm the one he should be with.

44
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:26,896
[Shannan] Did you guys
see this?

45
00:01:28,137 --> 00:01:29,517
[Kelle] <i>I'm sure
the other women here</i>

46
00:01:29,517 --> 00:01:31,377
are gonna lose their
[bleep] man.

47
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:32,379
[chuckles softly]

48
00:02:10,862 --> 00:02:12,932
[Pola] <i>So, Jose
is not in my room.</i>

49
00:02:12,931 --> 00:02:14,481
<i>I have no idea why.</i>

50
00:02:14,482 --> 00:02:15,832
<i>He never does that.</i>

51
00:02:15,827 --> 00:02:18,067
<i>If he was thinking
of not coming home,</i>

52
00:02:18,068 --> 00:02:19,338
<i>he would've told me.</i>

53
00:02:19,344 --> 00:02:20,664
<i>I have no idea
what's going on.</i>

54
00:02:20,655 --> 00:02:22,235
Like, I tried to text him,

55
00:02:22,241 --> 00:02:23,901
but I haven't had any answer

56
00:02:23,896 --> 00:02:24,926
and that's really weird.

57
00:02:39,655 --> 00:02:41,475
- Thank you.
- Of course.

58
00:02:41,482 --> 00:02:43,972
[Jose] <i>My relationship
with Kelle has been</i>

59
00:02:43,965 --> 00:02:45,615
full of ups and downs.

60
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,690
We started very well
at the Mushroom rock.

61
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:49,519
<i>- Do you love it?
- Yeah, I love it.</i>[chuckles]

62
00:02:49,517 --> 00:02:51,617
<i>Thank you and I'm happy
to share this with you.</i>

63
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,860
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

64
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,454
And then with some
of the disagreements

65
00:02:59,448 --> 00:03:00,898
and the shouting...

66
00:03:00,896 --> 00:03:02,546
it went a little bit down.

67
00:03:02,551 --> 00:03:04,521
<i>You're not here to speak
your first language.</i>

68
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,137
[indistinct conversation]

69
00:03:06,137 --> 00:03:08,067
<i>- We're talking together--
- But it's rude!</i>

70
00:03:08,068 --> 00:03:09,408
<i>She's shouting at me,
just like...</i>

71
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:12,214
You think they noticed
that we've gone?

72
00:03:13,344 --> 00:03:15,664
Let's not think
about them, please.

73
00:03:15,655 --> 00:03:17,685
- [Kelle] I know. [chuckles]
- [chuckles]

74
00:03:17,689 --> 00:03:19,209
[Jose] <i>After getting
to know everybody,</i>

75
00:03:19,206 --> 00:03:21,306
<i>I think I might wanna reignite</i>

76
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,590
<i>my connection with Kelle.</i>

77
00:03:22,586 --> 00:03:24,856
<i>Kelle has been wanting
to see my wild side.</i>

78
00:03:24,862 --> 00:03:26,482
I'm ready to show her...

79
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,070
my wild side.

80
00:03:28,758 --> 00:03:30,208
This is sneaky.

81
00:03:30,206 --> 00:03:32,206
- But I like it.
- This is romantic,

82
00:03:32,206 --> 00:03:33,716
- for where I'm from.
- Aw...

83
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:36,761
Let's see if this opens.
There you go.

84
00:03:37,482 --> 00:03:38,592
Here you go.

85
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:40,686
- After you. Mmm-hmm.
<i>- Gracias.</i>

86
00:03:40,689 --> 00:03:41,789
I think I like it better than

87
00:03:41,793 --> 00:03:43,033
my room at the villa.

88
00:03:43,034 --> 00:03:44,344
[Jose] You do?

89
00:03:44,344 --> 00:03:46,144
- [Kelle] Yeah.
- [Jose] Okay.

90
00:03:46,137 --> 00:03:50,207
<i>Having alone time
without any distractions...</i>

91
00:03:50,206 --> 00:03:53,066
<i>will allow us
to loosen up more.</i>

92
00:03:53,068 --> 00:03:54,548
So, tonight is all about

93
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:56,521
seeing if we can find
that spark again.

94
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,340
[pops]

95
00:03:58,344 --> 00:04:00,214
- [chuckles]
- [Jose] Okay. Okay, cool.

96
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:02,236
It scared you? [chuckles]

97
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:03,451
Don't get scared, Kelle.

98
00:04:03,448 --> 00:04:04,618
[Kelle] I knew
it's coming, too.

99
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:06,623
Senorita Kelle.

100
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,620
[Kelle] Mmm-hmm.

101
00:04:08,137 --> 00:04:09,967
[speaking Spanish]

102
00:04:10,724 --> 00:04:11,834
[chuckles]

103
00:04:11,827 --> 00:04:14,897
For the pleasure and honor
of being here with you.

104
00:04:14,896 --> 00:04:17,066
- Aw. Thank you. <i>Salud.
- Salud.</i>

105
00:04:19,068 --> 00:04:20,378
[Kelle] <i>I would sneak out
with Jose</i>

106
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:21,549
<i>every day of the week.</i>

107
00:04:22,758 --> 00:04:25,408
I'm definitely seeing
a playful side in Jose.

108
00:04:25,413 --> 00:04:27,723
I'm not used to seeing him
like this.

109
00:04:27,724 --> 00:04:29,284
<i>He always seems so serious</i>

110
00:04:29,275 --> 00:04:30,855
<i>and I feel like I bring...</i>

111
00:04:30,862 --> 00:04:33,032
the younger side of him out.

112
00:04:33,793 --> 00:04:35,623
So risky, but so fun.

113
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,410
[Jose] I mean, when I'm
decided with something,

114
00:04:37,413 --> 00:04:39,143
I just go for it.

115
00:04:39,137 --> 00:04:41,547
So, why me?

116
00:04:41,551 --> 00:04:43,971
Other than the initial
attraction, of course...

117
00:04:43,965 --> 00:04:44,965
you're just...

118
00:04:45,758 --> 00:04:47,208
you're super-positive.

119
00:04:47,206 --> 00:04:50,136
You just have such a very
kind heart and gentle soul.

120
00:04:50,137 --> 00:04:52,237
But I feel like
you have an old soul, too.

121
00:04:52,241 --> 00:04:53,791
- Mmm-hmm.
- So...

122
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,243
- Thank you.
- And I love your mom.

123
00:04:55,241 --> 00:04:56,691
- She's amazing.
- She is amazing.

124
00:04:56,689 --> 00:04:57,549
And she's fun.

125
00:04:58,241 --> 00:04:59,451
What made you...

126
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,970
circle back over here?

127
00:05:01,965 --> 00:05:05,375
So, I didn't know
if we were going to connect...

128
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:07,339
- [Kelle] Mmm-hmm. Okay.
- initially.

129
00:05:07,344 --> 00:05:09,004
So, I just kept
my mind open...

130
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,830
- Mmm-hmm.
- And...

131
00:05:10,827 --> 00:05:13,717
I really loved just
how spontaneous you were

132
00:05:13,724 --> 00:05:16,104
when you asked me out
on that plan

133
00:05:16,103 --> 00:05:17,863
- for Mushroom Rock.
- Mmm-hmm.

134
00:05:17,862 --> 00:05:20,172
And I really love
how we connected

135
00:05:20,172 --> 00:05:22,212
and we spoke there and...

136
00:05:22,206 --> 00:05:24,686
what I learned
about you and...

137
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:27,029
what you learned about me
and how...

138
00:05:27,034 --> 00:05:29,624
I opened up with you.

139
00:05:30,793 --> 00:05:32,173
Also, you're very beautiful.

140
00:05:50,172 --> 00:05:53,172
[Kelle] <i>Everything about Jose
is amazing.</i>

141
00:05:53,172 --> 00:05:54,282
Everything.

142
00:05:54,275 --> 00:05:56,615
Obviously, we keep gravitating
back to one another.

143
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,760
[Jose] Hmm.

144
00:05:57,758 --> 00:05:59,788
The fact that Jose is really
stepping up right now

145
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:00,793
is huge for me.

146
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:02,863
Like, he's always been
my number one.

147
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,592
[Jose] I love how...

148
00:06:04,586 --> 00:06:06,686
um... with
certain people how...

149
00:06:07,896 --> 00:06:09,786
- I am, you know.
- [Kelle] Mmm-hmm.

150
00:06:09,793 --> 00:06:11,553
And I like to stick around
those people.

151
00:06:12,586 --> 00:06:14,716
So, you're one of those.

152
00:06:14,724 --> 00:06:16,934
Stick around with people
that get the best out of you.

153
00:06:16,931 --> 00:06:19,381
- Yeah.
- And just enjoy...

154
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:23,171
- I agree.
<i>- Salud</i> for that.

155
00:06:23,172 --> 00:06:24,242
[Kelle] Mmm-hmm. Again...

156
00:06:25,137 --> 00:06:27,067
<i>- Salud.</i>
- Mexicans say <i>Salud</i>

157
00:06:27,068 --> 00:06:28,928
- every single phrase.
- I know... [chuckles]

158
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:30,411
- I know that...
- So, get used to it, Kelle.

159
00:06:30,413 --> 00:06:31,693
No, I noticed that,

160
00:06:31,689 --> 00:06:33,619
- because your mom does that
all the time.
- All the time.

161
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,000
- [chuckles]
- Yeah. All the time.

162
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,860
We'll do many more of those
for sure.

163
00:06:39,448 --> 00:06:40,688
And many more of these...

164
00:06:44,517 --> 00:06:45,897
Mmm!

165
00:06:45,896 --> 00:06:47,756
[chuckling]

166
00:06:47,758 --> 00:06:49,028
You're being playful, eh?

167
00:07:03,034 --> 00:07:03,974
Come on.

168
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,340
[Jose] <i>I think it was time</i>

169
00:07:06,344 --> 00:07:09,484
to take that next step

170
00:07:09,482 --> 00:07:11,592
of getting to know her.

171
00:07:11,586 --> 00:07:14,136
<i>This night started
with an impulse</i>

172
00:07:14,137 --> 00:07:15,757
<i>and a world of possibilities.</i>

173
00:07:15,758 --> 00:07:17,338
<i>But after this...</i>

174
00:07:17,344 --> 00:07:20,594
<i>it confirmed many things
between her and I.</i>

175
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,100
[Kelle sighs]

176
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:33,659
<i>- Hola.
- Buenos dias.</i>

177
00:07:33,655 --> 00:07:35,825
<i>- Buenos dias, Senora.</i>
- [chuckles softly]

178
00:07:35,827 --> 00:07:36,757
[Jose] Good morning.

179
00:07:36,758 --> 00:07:37,788
- Morning.
- [glasses clink]

180
00:07:37,793 --> 00:07:39,903
- Did you have fun?
- Amazing.

181
00:07:39,896 --> 00:07:40,926
- You?
- Yeah.

182
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,620
[Kelle] <i>After Billy left me,</i>

183
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,450
<i>I would take
anything with Jose</i>

184
00:07:45,448 --> 00:07:47,478
<i>over anything with Billy
any day.</i>

185
00:07:47,482 --> 00:07:50,312
We had an amazing night
together, for sure.

186
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:53,410
<i>- Salud.</i>[chuckles]
<i>- Salud</i> to enjoying the moment.

187
00:07:53,413 --> 00:07:55,103
Billy definitely
did me a favor.

188
00:07:55,103 --> 00:07:56,173
Thank you, Billy.

189
00:07:56,172 --> 00:07:57,902
It was good to do this.

190
00:07:57,896 --> 00:07:59,446
- I love it.
- [Kelle] Mmm-hmm.

191
00:07:59,448 --> 00:08:01,068
It's funny that we can see
the house from here, no?

192
00:08:01,068 --> 00:08:02,028
The villa?

193
00:08:03,551 --> 00:08:04,971
[chuckles]

194
00:08:04,965 --> 00:08:07,065
- Yeah, we're not coming back.
- [Kelle] <i>Hola!</i>

195
00:08:07,068 --> 00:08:08,138
<i>- Salud.</i>
- [chuckles]

196
00:08:08,413 --> 00:08:09,553
<i>Salud.</i>

197
00:08:09,551 --> 00:08:10,761
Hi, Pola.

198
00:08:10,758 --> 00:08:12,998
- [chuckles] Hi, Joey.
- [both chuckle]

199
00:08:19,931 --> 00:08:21,241
- Where's my buddy?
- I don't know.

200
00:08:21,655 --> 00:08:23,065
You always know.

201
00:08:23,068 --> 00:08:24,858
- Mmm-hmm.
- He didn't sleep in my room.

202
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,380
Excuse me!

203
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:29,591
What?

204
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,211
[April] Really, Pola?

205
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:36,519
[Pola] <i>Jose always tells me
where he's going</i>

206
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:38,717
and it was weird
that he didn't mention

207
00:08:38,724 --> 00:08:39,694
anything to me,

208
00:08:39,689 --> 00:08:41,549
because we have
a great communication.

209
00:08:41,551 --> 00:08:43,171
<i>He's gonna have
an explanation.</i>

210
00:08:43,172 --> 00:08:45,172
I saw him
sneak out with Kelle.

211
00:08:45,172 --> 00:08:46,142
Are you serious?

212
00:08:47,275 --> 00:08:48,685
[Shannan] To not come back,

213
00:08:48,689 --> 00:08:49,969
that's not him.

214
00:08:49,965 --> 00:08:51,235
I have no words.

215
00:08:51,689 --> 00:08:54,069
I am devastated.

216
00:08:54,068 --> 00:08:54,998
[Ryan]

217
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,590
[Shannan] <i>I should've
came through.</i>

218
00:08:56,586 --> 00:08:58,756
- Where y'all going?
- Where you going?

219
00:08:58,758 --> 00:09:01,448
I don't think it's his type
as well.

220
00:09:01,448 --> 00:09:03,758
I don't see him with her.

221
00:09:03,758 --> 00:09:04,758
Right.

222
00:09:04,758 --> 00:09:06,718
I really cannot believe
Jose chose

223
00:09:06,724 --> 00:09:08,244
Kelle to spend
a night with him.

224
00:09:08,896 --> 00:09:10,716
Like, maybe having a drink.

225
00:09:10,724 --> 00:09:12,484
- Right.
- And dancing on a little bit.

226
00:09:12,482 --> 00:09:15,932
Yes. But Jose is really like
he goes very deep.

227
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:17,451
- You know.
- I know how he is.

228
00:09:17,448 --> 00:09:19,308
- I know. We have
very thoughtful conversations.
- And I don't know if Kelle

229
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,310
is like that.

230
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,900
- [whispers] Ready?
- [whispers] Yeah.

231
00:09:26,448 --> 00:09:28,618
Oh, I'm definitely
a little bit nervous

232
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,900
going back to the Villa.

233
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:32,757
[Pola] <i>Like, he's not
gonna come back.</i>

234
00:09:32,758 --> 00:09:34,408
He texted me.
He always tells Mom.

235
00:09:34,413 --> 00:09:35,483
- Just...
- He's right there.

236
00:09:37,517 --> 00:09:39,277
- Where?
- [April] We have questions.
Here he comes.

237
00:09:39,275 --> 00:09:41,785
- Really?
- Yeah. I got
a lot of questions.

238
00:09:43,103 --> 00:09:44,723
- One, two... four moms.
- [April] Jose...

239
00:09:44,724 --> 00:09:45,764
<i>Buenos dias.</i> How are you?

240
00:09:45,758 --> 00:09:48,028
- Ehm... late, bruh.
- [yawns]

241
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:51,585
I didn't know what's going on.

242
00:09:51,586 --> 00:09:52,616
<i>I'm like...</i>

243
00:10:05,586 --> 00:10:06,786
<i>I couldn't stay there.</i>

244
00:10:06,793 --> 00:10:08,553
I was just heartbroken.

245
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:10,621
I was crushed.

246
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,690
[both] And where did you
sleep last night?

247
00:10:12,689 --> 00:10:13,969
Just going around.

248
00:10:13,965 --> 00:10:15,785
- [Shannan] Excuse me?
- Going around where?

249
00:10:15,793 --> 00:10:17,933
- Oh, we went around town.
It was cool.
- With who?

250
00:10:17,931 --> 00:10:19,901
- Uh-huh.
- Like, me,
by myself. [chuckles]

251
00:10:19,896 --> 00:10:21,446
- No, you weren't.
- [laughs]

252
00:10:21,448 --> 00:10:23,758
- [Shannan] Tell him...
- [April] Tell him by yourself.

253
00:10:23,758 --> 00:10:24,898
- No, you weren't...
- I don't remember
where I was.

254
00:10:24,896 --> 00:10:26,026
- [Shannan] I saw...
- I sleepwalk.

255
00:10:26,034 --> 00:10:28,144
I saw Kelle
sneak out with you.

256
00:10:28,137 --> 00:10:29,787
Y'all not sleek,
I saw it.

257
00:10:29,793 --> 00:10:31,933
- [April] Jose!
- I saw it. I saw it...

258
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:32,861
with my own eyes.

259
00:10:32,862 --> 00:10:33,972
- [Jose] Yeah?
- [Shannan] Uh-huh.

260
00:10:35,793 --> 00:10:38,143
[Jose] <i>A relationship
is between two people.</i>

261
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,757
We don't wanna talk
about this with anyone...

262
00:10:40,758 --> 00:10:43,378
'cause it's between
Kelle and Jose.

263
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:45,899
I don't know. Your stock
went down with me right now.

264
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:47,786
My stock went down
with you, why?

265
00:10:47,793 --> 00:10:48,933
- Why?
- [Shannan] Yes.

266
00:10:48,931 --> 00:10:49,971
Not cool at all.

267
00:10:50,931 --> 00:10:52,071
[Jose] Mmm-hmm.

268
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,758
It's Kelle's fault that
Jose is not being truthful.

269
00:10:54,758 --> 00:10:56,138
<i>I think that...</i>

270
00:10:56,137 --> 00:10:59,277
<i>whatever they did
the night before...</i>

271
00:11:00,103 --> 00:11:02,863
she's controlling
the situation...

272
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,972
Yeah. He keeps trying
to deflect.

273
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:06,655
Anybody wants coffee?

274
00:11:06,655 --> 00:11:09,305
You're just popping around
from one to the next?

275
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,660
- What's up with that?
- [Pola] Yeah.
You don't do that.

276
00:11:10,655 --> 00:11:11,825
That's not cool.

277
00:11:11,827 --> 00:11:13,967
If you trying to play me,
it's not gonna work for me.

278
00:11:15,655 --> 00:11:17,855
- Okay. Let's go... oh...
- [Pola] Right now...

279
00:11:17,862 --> 00:11:19,312
You don't want your coffee
before you go?

280
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:20,480
No, thank you.

281
00:11:20,482 --> 00:11:21,482
- Oh, my God.
- [Shannan] Did somebody
say something?

282
00:11:25,931 --> 00:11:29,101
"Tomorrow, it will be the time
to choose your match.

283
00:11:29,103 --> 00:11:31,103
If your choice is a mismatch,

284
00:11:31,103 --> 00:11:32,283
you could go home."

285
00:11:32,689 --> 00:11:34,339
Ah...

286
00:11:34,344 --> 00:11:37,004
"If your choice is a mismatch,
you could be going home."

287
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,140
What does that mean?

288
00:11:38,137 --> 00:11:39,337
- Why would it be a mismatch?
- If somebody picks you,

289
00:11:39,344 --> 00:11:40,484
but you don't pick them.

290
00:11:40,482 --> 00:11:41,792
[Jimmy] <i>I just wanna
find love.</i>

291
00:11:41,793 --> 00:11:44,553
And I really haven't got
to connect with somebody.

292
00:11:44,551 --> 00:11:46,211
It just isn't working out
with me.

293
00:11:53,965 --> 00:11:55,165
[phone chimes]

294
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,172
"Moms and sons,

295
00:11:57,172 --> 00:12:00,522
we all have dirty laundry
that needs to be addressed.

296
00:12:00,517 --> 00:12:03,617
Today, there's a bin full
of the men's dirty laundry

297
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,380
waiting for the moms.

298
00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:07,789
And one full of the women's
dirty laundry

299
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:09,553
waiting for the sons.

300
00:12:09,551 --> 00:12:12,521
The mother and son
who correctly identify

301
00:12:12,517 --> 00:12:14,967
the most pieces
of each other's dirty laundry

302
00:12:14,965 --> 00:12:17,205
- will win a special date..."
- Wow.

303
00:12:17,206 --> 00:12:18,786
"Sons, you're up first.

304
00:12:18,793 --> 00:12:20,523
It's time to start sorting."

305
00:12:20,517 --> 00:12:22,407
[laughs boisterously]

306
00:12:22,413 --> 00:12:24,343
- Wow.
- [Stefany] Billy, we got this.

307
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:25,724
[woman chuckles]

308
00:12:25,724 --> 00:12:27,594
[Joey] <i>I'm kinda grossed out</i>

309
00:12:27,586 --> 00:12:29,716
and I never thought
I'd be doing this

310
00:12:29,724 --> 00:12:32,174
ever in my life,
but here we go.

311
00:12:32,172 --> 00:12:34,622
I'm pretty sure
my dirty laundry

312
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,830
is pretty hot.

313
00:12:36,517 --> 00:12:38,407
- Oh, God...
- [chuckles]

314
00:12:38,413 --> 00:12:40,243
[Jimmy] If you identify
your mom's underwear...

315
00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:42,999
- [all chuckling]
- That's what I'm saying.

316
00:12:45,379 --> 00:12:47,719
You shouldn't know
your mom's underwear.

317
00:12:47,724 --> 00:12:49,004
[Harrison] <i>I'm not
looking forward</i>

318
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,030
- to this.
- Is it just weird,

319
00:12:50,034 --> 00:12:52,034
'cause it's mine, or like...

320
00:12:52,034 --> 00:12:53,724
Uh, it's just weird
in general.

321
00:12:53,724 --> 00:12:55,314
[chuckles]

322
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,720
- Get it!
- Uh!

323
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:00,068
- Uh!
- All right.

324
00:13:00,068 --> 00:13:02,138
- Let's get to work, boys.
- Oh, man.

325
00:13:02,137 --> 00:13:03,787
Should we go...

326
00:13:03,793 --> 00:13:05,863
This is Ryan's. [chuckles]

327
00:13:05,862 --> 00:13:07,792
Yeah... whoa!

328
00:13:07,793 --> 00:13:09,593
[Jose] My mommy's more
of the sport.

329
00:13:09,586 --> 00:13:12,026
So, it may be this one
for sure.

330
00:13:13,103 --> 00:13:14,763
And this one for sure.

331
00:13:14,758 --> 00:13:17,278
I mean, I worked out
with my mom.

332
00:13:17,275 --> 00:13:18,965
These are kinda sexy, right?

333
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,965
These kinda sexy.
I feel like...

334
00:13:21,482 --> 00:13:22,622
I feel like...

335
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,280
[Jose] So, you did that
thinking it was your mom's?

336
00:13:24,275 --> 00:13:25,715
[all exclaiming]

337
00:13:25,724 --> 00:13:27,314
Your son put that
in the mouth.

338
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:29,450
- Is that yours?
- [Shannan] Oh,
that's a little small.

339
00:13:29,448 --> 00:13:31,408
- [chuckles]
- No, that ain't mine.

340
00:13:31,413 --> 00:13:33,793
[Gabriel] <i>Ryan definitely
was not funny.</i>

341
00:13:33,793 --> 00:13:35,453
I didn't even think
he came off sexy.

342
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:36,618
[all cheering]

343
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,970
It was really off-putting.

344
00:13:38,965 --> 00:13:40,545
These look like
double-ds to y'all?

345
00:13:40,551 --> 00:13:41,761
[Jimmy] No, bruh!

346
00:13:41,758 --> 00:13:43,588
Those are Bs.

347
00:13:43,586 --> 00:13:44,756
[Jimmy] <i>Your mom's a D, bro.</i>

348
00:13:44,758 --> 00:13:45,858
<i>- Like, what?</i>
- [chuckles]

349
00:13:45,862 --> 00:13:48,382
I'm like, that's how I know
Joey's a kid still.

350
00:13:48,379 --> 00:13:49,899
<i>He literally has
a B-size bra on.</i>

351
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:51,966
He's going like, "Yup.
These are my mom's."

352
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:53,615
It's the other way
around, dude.

353
00:13:53,965 --> 00:13:55,475
[chuckles]

354
00:13:56,965 --> 00:13:59,545
I don't think any of them
are my mom's.

355
00:13:59,551 --> 00:14:02,281
I'm not feeling very confident
in this challenge.

356
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:03,515
So, wait, wait, wait, wait.

357
00:14:03,517 --> 00:14:05,307
How you go from extra large

358
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:08,000
- to small, my guy?
- I didn't check
the size on this.

359
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,340
You should've.

360
00:14:09,344 --> 00:14:11,174
I... [chuckles softly]

361
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,100
don't wear underwear.

362
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,283
- Ew.
- [chuckles]

363
00:14:16,275 --> 00:14:17,965
That's so nasty.

364
00:14:17,965 --> 00:14:19,755
Everybody confident
in their pick?

365
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:21,588
- We're good. Let's go.
- All right.

366
00:14:21,586 --> 00:14:23,166
I'm a little nervous.

367
00:14:23,172 --> 00:14:24,832
I think, you know,

368
00:14:24,827 --> 00:14:27,377
<i>what am I revealing
about like...</i>

369
00:14:27,379 --> 00:14:29,279
<i>You know...</i>[hesitates]

370
00:14:29,275 --> 00:14:30,715
<i>- You...</i>
- [chuckles]

371
00:14:32,068 --> 00:14:33,788
- What are you gonna
find out about me?
- [chuckles]

372
00:14:33,793 --> 00:14:37,103
- [chuckles]
- It's very strange.

373
00:14:37,103 --> 00:14:40,213
[all exclaiming, cheering]

374
00:14:40,206 --> 00:14:41,996
[all cheering]

375
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,590
- [all cheering]
- [Harrison] Let's go!

376
00:14:44,586 --> 00:14:45,656
[indistinct conversation]

377
00:14:45,655 --> 00:14:47,375
- It's a two?
- This is Billy.

378
00:14:47,379 --> 00:14:49,169
- These are Billy's.
- Did you bought them?

379
00:14:49,172 --> 00:14:50,662
- I did, actually.
- [all laughing]

380
00:14:50,655 --> 00:14:52,275
Oh, my gosh.

381
00:14:52,275 --> 00:14:54,445
I know for a fact,
these are Ryan's.

382
00:14:54,448 --> 00:14:55,688
I know that.

383
00:14:55,689 --> 00:14:58,339
- They're silky.
- [chuckles]

384
00:14:58,344 --> 00:14:59,794
- Feel like your son?
- [chuckles]

385
00:14:59,793 --> 00:15:01,213
- Maybe.
- Okay.

386
00:15:01,206 --> 00:15:03,276
[chuckles]

387
00:15:03,275 --> 00:15:04,545
[April] Wait a second.

388
00:15:04,551 --> 00:15:07,101
This has to be Harrison's,

389
00:15:07,103 --> 00:15:08,553
- Right?
- [Soyoung] Yes.

390
00:15:08,551 --> 00:15:09,931
<i>Magic Mike.</i>

391
00:15:10,241 --> 00:15:12,071
Hello!

392
00:15:12,068 --> 00:15:13,898
- Is this...
- [Charlene] These
are not Harrison's.

393
00:15:13,896 --> 00:15:15,996
[April] I think
this is Harrison's.

394
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,340
[Harrison] <i>No, that wasn't me.</i>

395
00:15:17,344 --> 00:15:20,244
I never wore like
the thongs or the jockstraps

396
00:15:20,241 --> 00:15:22,691
for stripping...
I always kept it...

397
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:25,589
classy, with like, some
boxer briefs. [chuckles]

398
00:15:25,586 --> 00:15:27,336
I think these belong
to Harrison's.

399
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:29,454
These look like
some exotic dancer.

400
00:15:29,448 --> 00:15:31,028
I mean, you can't
keep it classy,

401
00:15:31,034 --> 00:15:32,694
when you're stripping,
but like...

402
00:15:32,689 --> 00:15:34,789
<i>I just wanted to keep it...</i>

403
00:15:34,793 --> 00:15:37,383
<i>comfortable and I just
don't see wearing a thong</i>

404
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:39,099
being comfortable
at all. [chuckles]

405
00:15:39,862 --> 00:15:42,172
Okay, so, I chose...

406
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:45,519
these ones, because...

407
00:15:45,517 --> 00:15:49,207
eh... it's something
she should wear at the gym

408
00:15:49,206 --> 00:15:50,586
or she usually
wears at the gym.

409
00:15:50,586 --> 00:15:51,716
All the time.

410
00:15:51,724 --> 00:15:53,524
These ones too.

411
00:15:53,517 --> 00:15:56,687
- Yeah.
- And on a trip, we had our

412
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,029
suitcases mixed up.

413
00:15:58,034 --> 00:16:00,004
- So, when I opened them--
- And you found them there?

414
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It's an emoji on a...

415
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,170
- [Pola] A 100 percent.
- [all cheering]

416
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:05,452
[Jose] So, I remember...

417
00:16:05,448 --> 00:16:07,168
Pola's underwear
fit her personality.

418
00:16:07,862 --> 00:16:09,412
And it is a bit of a turn on.

419
00:16:09,413 --> 00:16:11,413
- What you see is what you get.
- A little spicy.

420
00:16:11,965 --> 00:16:13,895
Um, I chose these all,

421
00:16:13,896 --> 00:16:15,926
'cause I know my mom's
super-tiny.

422
00:16:15,931 --> 00:16:17,141
I looked in the sizes.

423
00:16:17,137 --> 00:16:19,137
It says "SP". It's like
super-small or something...

424
00:16:19,137 --> 00:16:21,337
-"Small Petite."
- [all cheering]

425
00:16:22,344 --> 00:16:23,764
All of them!

426
00:16:23,758 --> 00:16:25,688
I chose this one, pink one.

427
00:16:25,689 --> 00:16:27,069
- Yup, you got it.
- I thought...

428
00:16:27,068 --> 00:16:28,308
this one was yours, too.

429
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,620
There's one in there
that looks almost the same.

430
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,070
- [buzzer sounds]
- Almost. Right.

431
00:16:32,068 --> 00:16:33,028
[chuckling]

432
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:36,284
[Ryan] I feel like I've seen
these before.

433
00:16:36,275 --> 00:16:38,785
- Eh...
- Maybe like 15-20 years ago

434
00:16:38,793 --> 00:16:41,173
in the laundry basket somewhere.

435
00:16:41,172 --> 00:16:43,932
[Shannan] I would've
worn those 15-20 years ago.

436
00:16:43,931 --> 00:16:45,101
- I wear those now.
- Ah...

437
00:16:45,103 --> 00:16:46,863
- [chuckles]
- [buzzer sounds]

438
00:16:46,862 --> 00:16:48,552
[Ryan] You would've been
my second choice though.

439
00:16:48,551 --> 00:16:50,141
I did floss with 'em.

440
00:16:50,137 --> 00:16:51,447
I used my smarts to say

441
00:16:51,448 --> 00:16:53,138
she would definitely
bring a set.

442
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,787
So...

443
00:16:54,793 --> 00:16:56,973
- I think I'm good on
all three, eh?
- All three.

444
00:16:56,965 --> 00:16:58,965
- All right.
- [chuckles]

445
00:16:58,965 --> 00:17:02,065
I know my mom's all cutesy
and likes hearts and...
[bleep]

446
00:17:02,068 --> 00:17:03,408
- So...
- [chuckling]

447
00:17:03,413 --> 00:17:04,663
I was like, are these yours?

448
00:17:04,655 --> 00:17:06,965
- Yes.
- [all exclaiming]

449
00:17:06,965 --> 00:17:08,785
I got the one on your hat.

450
00:17:08,793 --> 00:17:11,173
April's underwear game
is strong.

451
00:17:11,172 --> 00:17:13,722
<i>I really didn't expect that
from her.</i>

452
00:17:13,724 --> 00:17:15,244
<i>Because she's really...</i>

453
00:17:15,241 --> 00:17:16,411
such a nice woman.

454
00:17:16,413 --> 00:17:17,933
- [chuckles softly]
- She's got a little fire.

455
00:17:18,482 --> 00:17:19,522
Damn!

456
00:17:19,517 --> 00:17:20,827
[Joey] As I was picking,

457
00:17:20,827 --> 00:17:22,407
you don't really wear bras

458
00:17:22,413 --> 00:17:25,033
and you're more just
out with it, but...

459
00:17:25,034 --> 00:17:27,034
Maybe this could
possibly be yours.

460
00:17:27,034 --> 00:17:28,344
That's definitely mine.

461
00:17:28,344 --> 00:17:31,214
- [Joey] It is!
- [all cheering]

462
00:17:31,206 --> 00:17:33,586
Underwear tells a lot
about a person.

463
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:35,376
<i>How they feel
about themselves.</i>

464
00:17:35,379 --> 00:17:37,829
<i>Seeing Kelle with...</i>

465
00:17:37,827 --> 00:17:39,407
<i>her choices of underwear...</i>

466
00:17:39,413 --> 00:17:41,003
- [Pola chuckles]
<i>-</i>[Jose] <i>It's...</i>

467
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,140
[Pola] <i>You were
expecting that.</i>

468
00:17:42,137 --> 00:17:42,997
[chuckling]

469
00:17:44,586 --> 00:17:46,376
- [chuckles]
- You were waiting for me
to tell you, though!

470
00:17:46,379 --> 00:17:47,519
No, I was just thinking...

471
00:17:47,517 --> 00:17:49,137
[chuckles]

472
00:17:49,137 --> 00:17:51,067
Kinda picked
the silver surfers,

473
00:17:51,068 --> 00:17:53,068
- but...
- Those are mine.

474
00:17:53,068 --> 00:17:55,028
[all chuckling]

475
00:17:55,034 --> 00:17:56,724
From the beginning, Joey and I

476
00:17:56,724 --> 00:17:58,664
were like, soulmates, so...

477
00:17:58,655 --> 00:18:01,405
it does not surprise me
that he picked my little,

478
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,033
<i>- panties with the bow.</i>
- [retches]

479
00:18:04,172 --> 00:18:06,622
[chuckles softly] I can't.

480
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,930
- Attaboy.
- [dings]

481
00:18:08,931 --> 00:18:11,411
So, I chose these for my son,
Gabriel Jane,

482
00:18:11,413 --> 00:18:13,213
because he is...

483
00:18:13,206 --> 00:18:15,206
an underwear model.
Am I right?

484
00:18:15,206 --> 00:18:17,026
Atta-mama! That's my mama!

485
00:18:18,172 --> 00:18:19,722
[all cheering]

486
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:20,794
Ooh!

487
00:18:20,793 --> 00:18:22,103
[Shannan] Ryan,
did I get these right?

488
00:18:22,103 --> 00:18:23,383
- [Ryan] It matches.
- [Shannan] Bam!

489
00:18:23,379 --> 00:18:26,409
He's also has a wild side
to him as we all know.

490
00:18:26,413 --> 00:18:27,383
Those are mine!

491
00:18:27,379 --> 00:18:29,619
[all chuckling]

492
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,970
So, I pick these three
for Billy.

493
00:18:32,965 --> 00:18:35,275
I actually purchased them
before we came.

494
00:18:35,275 --> 00:18:37,445
- [all chuckling]
- [Gabriel] Wow.

495
00:18:37,448 --> 00:18:39,208
[all applauding]

496
00:18:39,206 --> 00:18:40,446
[Kelle] Okay, Soyoung.

497
00:18:40,448 --> 00:18:41,718
All right, so, I picked...

498
00:18:41,724 --> 00:18:43,624
four for Jimmy...

499
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,550
There's a Korean one, too.

500
00:18:45,551 --> 00:18:48,211
[all exclaiming]

501
00:18:48,206 --> 00:18:49,276
I have three.

502
00:18:50,068 --> 00:18:51,998
They're exactly the same.

503
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,620
- [all chuckling]
- [woman] Oh, okay.
Very predictable

504
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,620
and consistent.

505
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:59,030
[Shannan] <i>Black is unassuming
and classic.</i>

506
00:18:59,034 --> 00:19:00,624
<i>Just like Jose.</i>

507
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,830
Did you think
they'd be bigger?

508
00:19:02,965 --> 00:19:04,715
[both chuckle]

509
00:19:04,724 --> 00:19:08,104
- [phone chimes]
-"Congratulations
to our winning duo.

510
00:19:08,103 --> 00:19:09,343
Soyoung and Jimmy."

511
00:19:09,344 --> 00:19:11,694
[all cheering]

512
00:19:11,689 --> 00:19:13,519
[Jimmy] Weirdly, I was like,
thinking to myself,

513
00:19:13,517 --> 00:19:14,997
whoever wins this challenge,

514
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,760
is just really sus,
you know what I mean?

515
00:19:16,758 --> 00:19:18,098
<i>I even told all the guys,</i>

516
00:19:18,103 --> 00:19:20,343
<i>if you know your mom's
underwear, you're a weirdo.</i>

517
00:19:20,344 --> 00:19:23,524
And somehow, I knew
all my mom's underwear.

518
00:19:23,517 --> 00:19:25,617
"You get to pick a date

519
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,930
for one of you.

520
00:19:26,931 --> 00:19:28,171
Take a few minutes

521
00:19:28,172 --> 00:19:29,342
to talk it over."

522
00:19:29,344 --> 00:19:31,384
We are good teamwork.

523
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:33,209
We like to win, so...

524
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:34,686
<i>I feel very excited
in the moment.</i>

525
00:19:34,689 --> 00:19:36,209
Um, it definitely
makes us feel

526
00:19:36,206 --> 00:19:38,026
- closer, I guess... yeah.
- A lot closer.

527
00:19:40,724 --> 00:19:42,344
All right, so, we got a date.

528
00:19:42,344 --> 00:19:43,864
What do you think?
You feeling a date tonight?

529
00:19:43,862 --> 00:19:45,662
I mean, I am...

530
00:19:45,655 --> 00:19:47,965
feeling somebody, but like,
at the same time...

531
00:19:47,965 --> 00:19:50,855
I rather, maybe you go out.

532
00:19:50,862 --> 00:19:52,932
I wanna take Jose out again

533
00:19:52,931 --> 00:19:55,381
and see where we go, you know.

534
00:19:55,379 --> 00:19:58,619
But we have this weird
distance feeling,

535
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:02,660
right after Kelle and him
went out together.

536
00:20:02,655 --> 00:20:04,445
I don't know.

537
00:20:04,448 --> 00:20:06,448
Uh, I think the girl
that I am feeling

538
00:20:06,448 --> 00:20:07,788
is not really feeling me.

539
00:20:07,793 --> 00:20:09,553
So, I don't really wanna
waste a date right now,

540
00:20:09,551 --> 00:20:12,141
until I really, like,
understand more.

541
00:20:15,379 --> 00:20:17,029
You think she's
running away or?

542
00:20:17,965 --> 00:20:19,335
No, I'm feeling Pola,
you know.

543
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:20,694
You know, we talk about it.

544
00:20:20,689 --> 00:20:23,379
But she's the only one I could
really see myself like...

545
00:20:23,379 --> 00:20:25,309
you know, getting to know,
interested in.

546
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,930
We have similar interests.

547
00:20:26,931 --> 00:20:28,971
The first week in the villa,
Pola and I...

548
00:20:28,965 --> 00:20:30,205
great connection.

549
00:20:30,206 --> 00:20:32,786
I really haven't got to
connect like that again

550
00:20:32,793 --> 00:20:33,793
with somebody.

551
00:20:33,793 --> 00:20:35,283
It just isn't
working out with me

552
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,855
<i>and I just want to find love.</i>

553
00:20:36,862 --> 00:20:38,212
I'm gonna give you a surprise.

554
00:20:38,206 --> 00:20:39,686
- Yeah, you gonna surprise me?
- Yeah.

555
00:20:41,655 --> 00:20:42,715
Yeah.

556
00:20:42,724 --> 00:20:45,524
Pola and I, yeah, we've
really, haven't really

557
00:20:45,517 --> 00:20:46,967
been communicating,
I would say,

558
00:20:46,965 --> 00:20:49,235
<i>'cause she's been spending
so much time with Ryan...</i>

559
00:20:49,241 --> 00:20:50,451
<i>Um...</i>

560
00:20:50,448 --> 00:20:52,138
<i>it kind of makes me
a little nervous,</i>

561
00:20:52,137 --> 00:20:53,997
but I still think
I have a good chance,

562
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,690
because I think what we had
was really genuine,

563
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:57,829
<i>but we'll see...</i>

564
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:03,103
[Charlene] I think Soyoung

565
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,453
is really good.

566
00:21:04,448 --> 00:21:05,858
I think she's
looking for the guy

567
00:21:05,862 --> 00:21:07,072
who'll put her into place.

568
00:21:07,068 --> 00:21:09,758
I'm having
a hard time finding...

569
00:21:09,758 --> 00:21:11,278
attraction to these moms.

570
00:21:11,275 --> 00:21:12,375
I can't act like...

571
00:21:12,379 --> 00:21:14,069
and fake like,
this is gonna happen.

572
00:21:14,068 --> 00:21:15,518
- Like never gonna happen.
- But listen,
this is what I'm saying...

573
00:21:15,517 --> 00:21:17,277
I don't need you in my ear
telling me

574
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:18,275
- no different.
- No.

575
00:21:24,724 --> 00:21:27,004
[Jimmy]

576
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,070
[both chuckle]

577
00:21:28,068 --> 00:21:29,998
- [continues indistinctly]
- Yes.

578
00:21:30,862 --> 00:21:32,312
So, what are we gonna do...

579
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,690
- Jimmy?
- Um...

580
00:21:33,689 --> 00:21:35,409
"What are we not going to do?"

581
00:21:35,413 --> 00:21:36,343
That is the real question.

582
00:21:36,344 --> 00:21:37,694
We're gonna experience life.

583
00:21:37,689 --> 00:21:39,789
- We're not gonna do...
- We're gonna experience life.

584
00:21:39,793 --> 00:21:42,243
I'm so glad that
I won this challenge,

585
00:21:42,241 --> 00:21:44,171
"Dirty underwear", even though
it's a little awkward,

586
00:21:44,172 --> 00:21:45,862
you know, I'm really glad
I prevailed,

587
00:21:45,862 --> 00:21:48,172
because it gives me one
last shot with Pola

588
00:21:48,172 --> 00:21:49,792
to go paddle-boarding

589
00:21:49,793 --> 00:21:51,763
and maybe I can win her over.

590
00:21:52,379 --> 00:21:53,549
[continues indistinctly]

591
00:21:55,068 --> 00:21:56,898
[Ryan] <i>Jimmy's taking Pola
on a date.</i>

592
00:21:56,896 --> 00:21:58,686
It kinda sucks in my eyes,

593
00:21:58,689 --> 00:22:00,899
<i>because I'm concerned</i>

594
00:22:00,896 --> 00:22:04,376
that Jimmy might pull
Pola's eyes from me.

595
00:22:05,172 --> 00:22:06,932
All right. Team work.

596
00:22:08,724 --> 00:22:10,594
What I like so much about Pola

597
00:22:10,586 --> 00:22:12,546
is that she is so independent

598
00:22:12,551 --> 00:22:14,141
<i>and just her own person.</i>

599
00:22:14,137 --> 00:22:15,967
<i>Very transparent.</i>

600
00:22:15,965 --> 00:22:17,545
<i>I can tell who she is</i>

601
00:22:17,551 --> 00:22:18,591
<i>and what she likes</i>

602
00:22:18,586 --> 00:22:20,306
<i>just based off of her
everyday movement</i>

603
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:22,310
<i>and I'm very interested
in the same things...</i>

604
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:25,690
<i>the gym and the beach
and silence, nature.</i>

605
00:22:25,689 --> 00:22:27,139
<i>She makes me feel very calm.</i>

606
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,447
I've never really had that...

607
00:22:29,344 --> 00:22:31,104
Beautiful spot.

608
00:22:31,103 --> 00:22:34,143
I like how I feel
about Ryan at this moment.

609
00:22:34,137 --> 00:22:35,757
But I'm not a 100 percent.

610
00:22:35,758 --> 00:22:38,408
<i>So, I'm gonna give myself
another opportunity</i>

611
00:22:38,413 --> 00:22:40,413
<i>to meet Jimmy again.</i>

612
00:22:40,827 --> 00:22:42,827
And let's see.

613
00:23:03,172 --> 00:23:04,212
[Jimmy] Yeah.

614
00:23:04,206 --> 00:23:07,136
I think me and Jimmy
have a beautiful connection.

615
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:09,517
But it has nothing
to do with Ryan.

616
00:23:09,517 --> 00:23:12,027
They're so different
from each other.

617
00:23:12,034 --> 00:23:13,724
<i>But I really, really, really</i>

618
00:23:13,724 --> 00:23:15,664
<i>love spending time
with both of them.</i>

619
00:23:15,655 --> 00:23:18,135
At this moment,
being with Jimmy...

620
00:23:18,137 --> 00:23:21,477
I'm only thinking about Jimmy.

621
00:23:21,482 --> 00:23:23,172
[Jimmy] Yeah, you're
the only person I could ever,

622
00:23:23,172 --> 00:23:25,142
like, in this house I see
myself, you know,

623
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:26,307
spending time with.

624
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:28,140
And it was obvious
from the start.

625
00:23:28,137 --> 00:23:30,207
Yeah, I think the reason
I do like you

626
00:23:30,206 --> 00:23:31,786
so much, is because you're...

627
00:23:31,793 --> 00:23:33,033
there's so much to you.

628
00:23:33,034 --> 00:23:34,144
I find Pola

629
00:23:34,137 --> 00:23:36,167
<i>the most beautiful
and interesting person here.</i>

630
00:23:36,172 --> 00:23:37,552
It's honestly clear to em

631
00:23:37,551 --> 00:23:38,661
<i>when I think in my head,</i>

632
00:23:38,655 --> 00:23:39,785
<i>Pola's very interested.</i>

633
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,103
<i>But at the same time...</i>

634
00:23:41,827 --> 00:23:43,587
she's keeping her options.

635
00:23:43,586 --> 00:23:45,376
<i>I know what Pola likes.</i>

636
00:23:45,379 --> 00:23:47,209
<i>And I know what Ryan likes.</i>

637
00:23:47,206 --> 00:23:49,786
<i>And those Lego pieces
just don't really fit.</i>

638
00:23:50,827 --> 00:23:52,447
So, why did you choose me?

639
00:23:53,241 --> 00:23:54,791
You know that saying,

640
00:23:54,793 --> 00:23:56,763
it's like, I'm in a room
full of people,

641
00:23:56,758 --> 00:23:58,378
but there's
nobody truly there.

642
00:23:58,379 --> 00:24:00,339
- That's true.
- And it's like
everywhere I go,

643
00:24:00,344 --> 00:24:01,384
I feel like
there's nobody there,

644
00:24:01,379 --> 00:24:02,549
but when I'm with you,
I feel like

645
00:24:02,551 --> 00:24:03,931
there's somebody that's
in there that, like,

646
00:24:03,931 --> 00:24:05,831
- you know, that exists.
- Mmm-hm.

647
00:24:05,827 --> 00:24:07,207
You don't need
to explain anymore.

648
00:24:07,206 --> 00:24:08,616
I understand.
I feel the same way.

649
00:24:09,896 --> 00:24:12,066
[Jimmy] <i>I feel really good
about Pola right now.</i>

650
00:24:12,068 --> 00:24:14,238
<i>She makes me feel lost
in the moments</i>

651
00:24:14,241 --> 00:24:15,931
<i>and I think
that's really important</i>

652
00:24:15,931 --> 00:24:17,551
<i>in any relationship.</i>

653
00:24:17,551 --> 00:24:18,931
I've never really had that.

654
00:24:18,931 --> 00:24:20,281
Never had somebody just...

655
00:24:20,275 --> 00:24:22,855
allow me to escape
from everything.

656
00:24:22,862 --> 00:24:25,072
But let me do something.
Just lay down on your back.

657
00:24:25,068 --> 00:24:26,448
- Mmm-hmm.
- And close your eyes.

658
00:24:26,448 --> 00:24:28,278
- Oh my back? Okay.
- Yeah.

659
00:24:28,275 --> 00:24:29,445
- [Pola] Mmm.
- [Jimmy] Mmm.

660
00:24:31,379 --> 00:24:32,899
[exhales]

661
00:24:32,896 --> 00:24:35,546
[Pola] <i>I really feel that
Jimmy is really sensual...</i>

662
00:24:35,551 --> 00:24:38,551
and that's part of why
I like to be around him.

663
00:24:41,965 --> 00:24:43,445
That feels so nice...

664
00:24:44,413 --> 00:24:45,793
[Pola]

665
00:24:51,965 --> 00:24:53,515
[Jimmy] <i>The water
starts to just</i>

666
00:24:53,517 --> 00:24:55,027
<i>swell in and out
through the sand.</i>

667
00:24:55,034 --> 00:24:56,934
<i>You can feel it
dripping on you.</i>

668
00:24:56,931 --> 00:24:59,381
<i>And it was very sensual and...</i>

669
00:24:59,379 --> 00:25:01,899
relaxing at the same time, I...

670
00:25:01,896 --> 00:25:03,136
you know, I'm glad like...

671
00:25:03,137 --> 00:25:05,067
I didn't get a boner
or anything.

672
00:25:05,068 --> 00:25:06,928
[Pola] <i>He has so much to give.</i>

673
00:25:06,931 --> 00:25:09,691
<i>And I love
sharing time with him.</i>

674
00:25:09,689 --> 00:25:13,069
I feel Ryan is more
fun to be around.

675
00:25:13,068 --> 00:25:14,338
<i>But I really feel like</i>

676
00:25:14,344 --> 00:25:15,974
<i>I have a great connection
with Jimmy.</i>

677
00:25:17,103 --> 00:25:19,763
<i>We are really
seeing each other</i>

678
00:25:19,758 --> 00:25:21,518
<i>and listening to each other.</i>

679
00:25:21,517 --> 00:25:22,827
He makes me feel
really special

680
00:25:22,827 --> 00:25:24,337
when I'm around him. He does.

681
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:28,760
- Mmm.
- So, you owe me a massage.

682
00:25:28,758 --> 00:25:30,238
I owe you everything.

683
00:25:30,241 --> 00:25:31,621
<i>- Salud.</i>
- I owe you the world.

684
00:25:38,551 --> 00:25:40,171
- [phone chimes]
- [Pola] <i>Hey!</i>

685
00:25:40,172 --> 00:25:41,452
<i>I got a text!</i>

686
00:25:41,448 --> 00:25:44,138
"The connection between
a mother and a son

687
00:25:44,137 --> 00:25:45,547
brought you to the villa..."

688
00:25:45,551 --> 00:25:46,761
[Charlene] Mmm...

689
00:25:46,758 --> 00:25:48,478
[Pola] "But to stay...

690
00:25:48,482 --> 00:25:51,002
you need to have formed
a new romantic one."

691
00:25:51,413 --> 00:25:54,003
[all exclaiming]

692
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,900
"Tomorrow, it will be the time
to choose your match."

693
00:25:56,896 --> 00:25:59,516
- [women chuckling]
- [all exclaiming]

694
00:25:59,517 --> 00:26:01,587
[Pola] "If the feeling
is mutual,

695
00:26:01,586 --> 00:26:04,856
you will continue with
this journey as a new pair.

696
00:26:04,862 --> 00:26:06,172
However...

697
00:26:06,172 --> 00:26:08,722
if your choice is a mismatch,

698
00:26:08,724 --> 00:26:10,344
you could be going home."

699
00:26:10,344 --> 00:26:13,904
[all exclaiming]

700
00:26:13,896 --> 00:26:15,926
[Ryan] <i>I'm a bit shellshocked
at this point.</i>

701
00:26:16,482 --> 00:26:17,522
<i>Because...</i>

702
00:26:17,517 --> 00:26:18,827
that's a lot of pressure,

703
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,377
I think, on a lot of people
in the house.

704
00:26:20,379 --> 00:26:21,829
Yeah...

705
00:26:23,724 --> 00:26:25,144
[Pola] <i>I feel stressed,</i>

706
00:26:25,137 --> 00:26:27,787
because I'm close to Ryan

707
00:26:27,793 --> 00:26:28,903
<i>and Jimmy.</i>

708
00:26:28,896 --> 00:26:32,066
So, if I have to pick
either one of them,

709
00:26:32,068 --> 00:26:33,828
that is a little bit scary.

710
00:26:33,827 --> 00:26:35,967
"If your choices
are mismatched,

711
00:26:35,965 --> 00:26:37,715
you could be going home."
What does that mean?

712
00:26:37,724 --> 00:26:39,244
- Why would it be a mismatch?
- Like, if somebody picks you,

713
00:26:39,241 --> 00:26:40,971
but you don't pick them.

714
00:26:40,965 --> 00:26:42,715
[Jimmy] <i>I would say that
I'm definitely here</i>

715
00:26:42,724 --> 00:26:45,174
<i>to experience love, find love.</i>

716
00:26:45,172 --> 00:26:46,902
And I think, with time,
you know,

717
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:48,896
Pola could possibly
be that person for me,

718
00:26:48,896 --> 00:26:50,236
and hopefully,
I could possibly

719
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:51,341
be that person for her.

720
00:26:52,551 --> 00:26:54,311
Yeah, I'm really
not connecting with anybody

721
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,240
on the villa.

722
00:26:55,241 --> 00:26:57,311
<i>I got a lot to think about
right now.</i>

723
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:59,860
And I don't really wanna
fake anything.

724
00:27:09,172 --> 00:27:11,722
[Charlene] I think Soyoung
is really good.

725
00:27:11,724 --> 00:27:14,074
You gotta just step up
to the plate and be a man.

726
00:27:14,068 --> 00:27:15,758
What would the man in you...

727
00:27:15,758 --> 00:27:16,718
who would you like?

728
00:27:16,724 --> 00:27:18,384
If it's Soyoung,
you gotta make a move

729
00:27:18,379 --> 00:27:19,479
and get in there.

730
00:27:19,482 --> 00:27:20,902
<i>I'm getting on
Harrison's case,</i>

731
00:27:20,896 --> 00:27:22,546
<i>because after the text,</i>

732
00:27:22,551 --> 00:27:24,521
<i>I don't want him to go home.</i>

733
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:26,757
This retreat is all about

734
00:27:26,758 --> 00:27:28,208
making that romantic love...

735
00:27:29,137 --> 00:27:30,067
connection.

736
00:27:30,068 --> 00:27:31,408
I think she's looking
for the guy

737
00:27:31,413 --> 00:27:32,593
to put her in the place.

738
00:27:32,586 --> 00:27:33,716
That's an opportunity

739
00:27:33,724 --> 00:27:35,664
for you to put on
the man-pants,

740
00:27:35,655 --> 00:27:37,755
because guess what?
That's never gonna go away.

741
00:27:37,758 --> 00:27:39,858
Women are always
gonna want that.

742
00:27:39,862 --> 00:27:42,312
We're always gonna
want that man,

743
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,720
who can take charge
in the bedroom.

744
00:27:43,724 --> 00:27:46,074
I need a man.
I need a man to be a man.

745
00:27:46,068 --> 00:27:47,378
And these women who're like,

746
00:27:47,379 --> 00:27:48,859
"I wanna be
in-charge and all",

747
00:27:48,862 --> 00:27:51,032
that's like cool sometimes.

748
00:27:51,034 --> 00:27:52,764
But if that's like your MO,

749
00:27:52,758 --> 00:27:54,378
like that's not normal.

750
00:27:54,379 --> 00:27:55,789
But if I go in the bedroom
with you

751
00:27:55,793 --> 00:27:57,213
and that's what
you're expecting,

752
00:27:57,206 --> 00:27:58,446
then why don't
I just be a lesbian?

753
00:27:58,448 --> 00:28:00,238
Why don't I just go
get a strap on

754
00:28:00,241 --> 00:28:01,721
and be with another woman?

755
00:28:02,379 --> 00:28:03,449
Why would I be with a man?

756
00:28:05,965 --> 00:28:08,135
I want you to step up
to the plate, okay?

757
00:28:08,137 --> 00:28:10,997
I just would like if you could
do that for me, Harrison.

758
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,100
You're picking up
what I'm putting down, huh?

759
00:28:14,103 --> 00:28:15,553
Bro, all you do is just...

760
00:28:15,551 --> 00:28:17,621
- talk, bro.
- [chuckles nervously]

761
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:20,310
Well, because what I'm saying

762
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,970
is valuable information.

763
00:28:21,965 --> 00:28:23,615
Will you pray about
what I'm saying?

764
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,790
- No, I will not.
- What?

765
00:28:25,793 --> 00:28:27,693
[Harrison] <i>Basically, my mom
wants the best for me</i>

766
00:28:27,689 --> 00:28:29,169
<i>for dating.</i>

767
00:28:29,172 --> 00:28:30,792
<i>I feel like my mom's like...</i>

768
00:28:30,793 --> 00:28:32,793
my whole life, has always been
like a coach on the sideline,

769
00:28:32,793 --> 00:28:33,863
<i>like, always coaching me up</i>

770
00:28:33,862 --> 00:28:35,862
<i>and just trying
to talk me through it and...</i>

771
00:28:35,862 --> 00:28:37,172
<i>just push through it,
get through it.</i>

772
00:28:37,172 --> 00:28:39,622
Having her there on
the sideline, like as a coach,

773
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,170
she has to know
when to, like, pull back

774
00:28:41,172 --> 00:28:42,662
when enough is enough.

775
00:28:42,655 --> 00:28:44,305
Tell me why you couldn't see

776
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,900
her being able to turn you on.

777
00:28:45,896 --> 00:28:48,516
I can't act like and fake like
this is gonna happen...

778
00:28:48,517 --> 00:28:50,307
- It's never gonna happen.
- But listen, this is what
I'm saying...

779
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:52,860
- And I don't need you in my
ear telling me no different.
- No.

780
00:28:52,862 --> 00:28:56,032
I'm having a hard time
finding an attraction

781
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:57,624
to these moms...

782
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:58,790
<i>They're a lot older than me.</i>

783
00:28:58,793 --> 00:29:00,173
<i>Yeah, they're
pretty and stuff,</i>

784
00:29:00,172 --> 00:29:01,662
but I'm just not really...

785
00:29:01,655 --> 00:29:02,855
attracted to them.

786
00:29:02,862 --> 00:29:04,032
Hey, I agree with you.

787
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:05,284
- I...
- Please don't get close to me.

788
00:29:05,275 --> 00:29:06,405
- You know... like...
- You know what I mean.

789
00:29:06,413 --> 00:29:08,003
Okay, well, I agree with you,

790
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,210
'cause it's an experiment.

791
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:10,546
And sometimes,
with an experiment,

792
00:29:10,551 --> 00:29:11,971
means we try something.

793
00:29:11,965 --> 00:29:15,275
- Trials and failures.
- Great! So, it's totally fine!

794
00:29:15,275 --> 00:29:16,755
[Charlene] <i>Me and Harrison,
definitely butt heads</i>

795
00:29:16,758 --> 00:29:17,718
<i>once in a while</i>

796
00:29:17,724 --> 00:29:20,864
and especially,
if I'm challenging him...

797
00:29:20,862 --> 00:29:23,412
you know, to sync
outside of his comfort zone...

798
00:29:23,965 --> 00:29:25,405
<i>it can be an issue</i>

799
00:29:25,413 --> 00:29:27,213
and that's what I'm doing.

800
00:29:27,206 --> 00:29:29,546
- Any other reason?
- I don't know, you tell me!

801
00:29:29,551 --> 00:29:32,341
Like, you keep hammering me.
Do you know how to zip it?

802
00:29:32,344 --> 00:29:33,794
- [Charlene] Well, because I...
- Please,

803
00:29:33,793 --> 00:29:35,033
- 'cause sometimes
you know how to talk--
- I wanna hear from you more.

804
00:29:35,034 --> 00:29:36,664
I know! I'm done talking!

805
00:29:36,655 --> 00:29:38,065
[Charlene] Well, tell us more!

806
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:39,448
I'm done talking, bruh.

807
00:29:40,551 --> 00:29:41,551
[sighs]

808
00:29:42,724 --> 00:29:44,454
Bro, all she does
is just talk.

809
00:29:44,965 --> 00:29:46,235
I'm so over it.

810
00:30:00,586 --> 00:30:01,826
[Harrison] <i>Coming
into the villa,</i>

811
00:30:01,827 --> 00:30:03,167
I was expecting to maybe,

812
00:30:03,172 --> 00:30:04,552
you know, find love or...

813
00:30:04,551 --> 00:30:05,971
you know, find a relationship,

814
00:30:05,965 --> 00:30:07,755
But it's just not
what I expected.

815
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:10,066
<i>I had, like, an open mind.</i>

816
00:30:10,068 --> 00:30:11,968
<i>I was willing to try
different things...</i>

817
00:30:11,965 --> 00:30:14,305
<i>you know, stick around
and see through, but...</i>

818
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:16,000
I just couldn't really
connect with the moms

819
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,760
in that kinda romantic level.

820
00:30:18,586 --> 00:30:19,996
So, I got something
to say to you.

821
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,030
Tell me.

822
00:30:21,034 --> 00:30:23,004
I'm really proud of you,
for, you know, opening up

823
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,070
and being yourself and...

824
00:30:25,068 --> 00:30:27,068
You know, it was really cool
for me to see that of you,

825
00:30:27,068 --> 00:30:29,408
but for me...

826
00:30:29,413 --> 00:30:31,863
I wanna have to tell you,
this is where my journey...

827
00:30:31,862 --> 00:30:33,552
is gonna come to a stop.

828
00:30:34,241 --> 00:30:35,791
- Um...
- Like, are you...

829
00:30:35,793 --> 00:30:37,553
are you sure?

830
00:30:37,551 --> 00:30:39,721
That's what I mean.
There's not really, like...

831
00:30:39,724 --> 00:30:41,694
one person here that
I kinda like...

832
00:30:41,689 --> 00:30:43,789
- hold on to--
- Like, not Soyoung? Not...

833
00:30:43,793 --> 00:30:45,793
- No.
- In the sauna, in the gym...

834
00:30:45,793 --> 00:30:47,663
working out, not in... just...

835
00:30:47,655 --> 00:30:49,165
- Not really.
- You're good? No?

836
00:30:49,172 --> 00:30:50,792
- Yeah.
- I was thinking that

837
00:30:50,793 --> 00:30:52,143
Harrison was missing out,

838
00:30:52,137 --> 00:30:54,307
because he wasn't getting
in touch with that

839
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,860
romantic, vulnerable side,

840
00:30:55,862 --> 00:30:57,932
<i>like, opening himself up
to a woman,</i>

841
00:30:57,931 --> 00:31:00,861
even if it's not like,
they're gonna fall in love.

842
00:31:00,862 --> 00:31:03,412
<i>But he's also set
in his principles</i>

843
00:31:03,413 --> 00:31:06,663
and it's kind of like,
why would you even go there,

844
00:31:06,655 --> 00:31:08,855
if there's
not a real possibility?

845
00:31:08,862 --> 00:31:11,142
If you know that,
then it's fine.

846
00:31:11,137 --> 00:31:12,547
I love you and I'm
super-proud of you

847
00:31:12,551 --> 00:31:13,621
- for being...
- Yeah.

848
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,450
- true to yourself.
- Mmm-hmm.

849
00:31:15,448 --> 00:31:18,028
- And you know... yeah.
- Staying true is all I can do.
That's it.

850
00:31:18,034 --> 00:31:19,414
- Yeah.
- It's the only thing
we can do.

851
00:31:20,551 --> 00:31:23,591
I really respect Harrison

852
00:31:23,586 --> 00:31:25,066
for wanting to go home

853
00:31:25,068 --> 00:31:27,448
and I'm really proud of him

854
00:31:27,448 --> 00:31:29,618
and I understand...

855
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:32,480
you know, the courage
and the decency

856
00:31:32,482 --> 00:31:34,692
that it takes for him

857
00:31:34,689 --> 00:31:36,479
<i>to stand on his principles</i>

858
00:31:36,482 --> 00:31:38,972
and be firm
and not lead anybody on.

859
00:31:39,655 --> 00:31:40,965
I gotta say goodbye.

860
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:42,095
- I'm leaving.
- [Gabriel] Why
are you leaving?

861
00:31:42,103 --> 00:31:43,033
Why?

862
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:43,934
You know, I haven't really

863
00:31:43,931 --> 00:31:45,521
connected with
anybody, like...

864
00:31:45,517 --> 00:31:46,687
on that level.

865
00:31:46,689 --> 00:31:48,139
You know, you guys have always
got a place in my heart,

866
00:31:48,137 --> 00:31:50,657
you know... I will always
remember your guys

867
00:31:50,655 --> 00:31:51,785
- and... cherish...
- [April] Mmm-hmm.

868
00:31:51,793 --> 00:31:52,793
[Charlene] We'll always
have Mexico.

869
00:31:52,793 --> 00:31:54,663
We'll always have Mexico...
La Paz.

870
00:31:54,655 --> 00:31:56,785
- [chuckles softly]
- You did amazing, you know?

871
00:31:56,793 --> 00:31:58,933
Yeah, I learned a lot here,
you know?

872
00:31:58,931 --> 00:32:01,831
Harrison is a great guy,
I think...

873
00:32:01,827 --> 00:32:03,997
you know, this whole dynamic

874
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,450
of dating older kinda
threw him for a loop.

875
00:32:06,448 --> 00:32:08,448
So, I totally see...

876
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:10,448
how, you know,
he made that choice

877
00:32:10,448 --> 00:32:12,478
and I respect him for it,
you know.

878
00:32:12,482 --> 00:32:15,382
God let him
out of here. [chuckles]

879
00:32:15,379 --> 00:32:16,549
- [Harrison] Good bye, Pola.
- [Pola] Take care.

880
00:32:16,551 --> 00:32:17,521
I'm really gonna miss you.

881
00:32:17,517 --> 00:32:18,857
Right, you too.

882
00:32:18,862 --> 00:32:20,172
- Goodbye, Jose.
- Oh...

883
00:32:20,172 --> 00:32:21,172
[Jose]
You're special, brother.

884
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:23,002
- Yeah, true.
- Thank you...

885
00:32:23,689 --> 00:32:25,479
Hi, Kelle.

886
00:32:25,482 --> 00:32:28,002
Once I got to the villa
and like, realized...

887
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,690
what the situation
was gonna be,

888
00:32:29,689 --> 00:32:30,829
<i>I really didn't wanna stay,</i>

889
00:32:30,827 --> 00:32:33,137
<i>but I stayed true
to my principles.</i>

890
00:32:33,137 --> 00:32:35,097
<i>Stood true
in what I believed in.</i>

891
00:32:35,103 --> 00:32:37,313
And through that, I feel like
my mom and I...

892
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:39,140
we got a little closer
and we grew.

893
00:32:39,137 --> 00:32:41,027
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

894
00:32:41,034 --> 00:32:42,314
- [Harrison] Have a good time.
- [Charlene] See you soon.

895
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,830
[Harrison] And
no holding back.

896
00:32:43,827 --> 00:32:45,967
<i>You know, I just wanted
to see her fall in love.</i>

897
00:32:45,965 --> 00:32:47,655
<i>She deserves it.
It's been a long time</i>

898
00:32:47,655 --> 00:32:48,895
<i>and I just wanna
see her happy.</i>

899
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:51,026
[Charlene] <i>Is there a guy
out there for me or what?</i>

900
00:32:51,034 --> 00:32:52,624
Anything's possible
at this point.

901
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,140
Anything is possible. Right.

902
00:33:06,034 --> 00:33:08,384
Harrison's just
left because...

903
00:33:08,379 --> 00:33:10,589
he wasn't feeling
a connection with anyone.

904
00:33:10,586 --> 00:33:13,026
<i>However, there's someone
I wanna get to know better.</i>

905
00:33:13,034 --> 00:33:15,554
<i>And I'm just gonna go for it.</i>

906
00:33:15,551 --> 00:33:18,761
You know, I came here
hoping to find love and...

907
00:33:18,758 --> 00:33:20,718
[clicks tongue] You know...

908
00:33:20,724 --> 00:33:22,524
I'm really hoping
I can make that happen.

909
00:33:27,896 --> 00:33:30,446
I really wanna get to know
Charlene a little bit better.

910
00:33:30,448 --> 00:33:32,898
<i>Because, you know,
she's so down to earth,</i>

911
00:33:32,896 --> 00:33:35,586
and sweet and you know...

912
00:33:35,586 --> 00:33:37,716
<i>kind of intellectual, so...</i>

913
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:40,284
I'm hoping I can use
the rest of my time here

914
00:33:40,275 --> 00:33:42,895
to make a connection
with Charlene.

915
00:33:42,896 --> 00:33:44,276
I was wondering if maybe
you wanted to take a...

916
00:33:44,275 --> 00:33:46,095
walk around
this cactus garden here.

917
00:33:46,103 --> 00:33:47,723
- That'd be great... Thank you.
- Yeah.

918
00:33:47,724 --> 00:33:48,904
[Ryan S chuckles softly]

919
00:33:50,965 --> 00:33:52,165
<i>There's a couple of things</i>

920
00:33:52,172 --> 00:33:53,722
that are pretty interesting,
you know...

921
00:33:53,724 --> 00:33:56,104
not all cacti are green,
for example.

922
00:33:56,103 --> 00:33:57,413
- Um...
- Right.

923
00:33:57,413 --> 00:33:58,973
There're some that are...

924
00:33:59,724 --> 00:34:02,174
purplish, reddish, yellowish.

925
00:34:02,172 --> 00:34:03,932
Here? That are here?

926
00:34:03,931 --> 00:34:05,931
- Uh...
- That you've seen
or you just...

927
00:34:05,931 --> 00:34:07,341
Oh, look. Here's purple.

928
00:34:07,344 --> 00:34:08,764
[Ryan S] <i>Yeah. Here's
a purple one.</i>

929
00:34:08,758 --> 00:34:10,068
- [chuckles nervously]
- [Charlene] <i>This is purple.</i>

930
00:34:10,068 --> 00:34:12,658
I'm blown away by the size
of all these...

931
00:34:16,758 --> 00:34:17,758
Yeah. It's kind of incredible.

932
00:34:17,758 --> 00:34:19,758
They only grow
one inch, a year.

933
00:34:19,758 --> 00:34:20,998
[Charlene] Really?

934
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,070
I definitely hope that Ryan
grows faster than a cactus.

935
00:34:24,068 --> 00:34:25,068
[chuckles]

936
00:34:25,068 --> 00:34:26,618
So, some of these
really tall ones...

937
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:29,100
there're some at least
ten feet tall here,

938
00:34:29,103 --> 00:34:30,833
they must be over
a 100-years-old.

939
00:34:30,827 --> 00:34:32,657
These are called
the elephant tree.

940
00:34:32,655 --> 00:34:34,755
- Okay.
- Um... in the genus <i>Procera.</i>

941
00:34:34,758 --> 00:34:37,278
The Native Americans actually
use the sap from this...

942
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:40,785
the red sap, as a way to heal

943
00:34:40,793 --> 00:34:42,103
skin conditions.

944
00:34:42,103 --> 00:34:44,523
[Charlene] <i>I did not know
I was going on a cactus date</i>

945
00:34:44,517 --> 00:34:46,827
and I'm thinking, aren't you
a software engineer?

946
00:34:46,827 --> 00:34:49,587
How do know all this stuff
about cactuses?

947
00:34:49,586 --> 00:34:51,616
- Wow! Look at this.
- Well, I have...

948
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,930
this ceviche.

949
00:34:52,931 --> 00:34:53,931
[Charlene] Very nice.

950
00:34:53,931 --> 00:34:56,171
I've noticed you drink coffee
pretty often.

951
00:34:56,172 --> 00:34:58,002
- So, might join you though.
- Yeah, pretty often. [giggles]

952
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,860
[Charlene] <i>I really enjoy
that Ryan took the time</i>

953
00:35:00,862 --> 00:35:04,342
<i>to create a day and a setting
that would...</i>

954
00:35:04,344 --> 00:35:05,384
<i>impress me,</i>

955
00:35:05,379 --> 00:35:06,999
<i>but also make me
feel comfortable</i>

956
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,690
and I'm totally...

957
00:35:09,206 --> 00:35:10,516
feeling special.

958
00:35:10,517 --> 00:35:12,027
So, tell me a little bit
more about

959
00:35:12,034 --> 00:35:13,214
what makes you tick.

960
00:35:13,206 --> 00:35:14,756
- You know... what drives you?
- Oh, nice!

961
00:35:15,758 --> 00:35:17,518
Well, I like that...

962
00:35:17,517 --> 00:35:19,587
the fact that you asked me
what drives me.

963
00:35:19,586 --> 00:35:21,856
I'm finding myself like...
a little attracted to you

964
00:35:21,862 --> 00:35:23,072
and I think that there's...

965
00:35:23,724 --> 00:35:25,004
you know... thank you...

966
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,660
something there, 'cause I was
like... [chuckles softly]

967
00:35:26,655 --> 00:35:28,405
- we haven't really...
- Yeah.

968
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:32,412
[Charlene] <i>I like Ryan and...</i>

969
00:35:32,413 --> 00:35:34,553
you know, we're out
under the stars.

970
00:35:34,551 --> 00:35:36,341
If we're gonna test the waters

971
00:35:36,344 --> 00:35:38,694
and see if there's
anything here...

972
00:35:38,689 --> 00:35:41,069
<i>This will be a good time
for a kiss, you know,</i>

973
00:35:41,068 --> 00:35:42,658
because then we'll know.

974
00:35:42,655 --> 00:35:44,825
- You like avocado?
- I love avocado.

975
00:35:44,827 --> 00:35:46,897
Everything in here, the onion,
you're good with?

976
00:35:46,896 --> 00:35:48,786
- [Ryan S] Oh, yeah.
- So, it's fair,

977
00:35:48,793 --> 00:35:50,003
we both have...

978
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,830
- Yeah...
- We'll both have onion breath.

979
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:54,027
[chuckles softly]

980
00:35:54,034 --> 00:35:55,724
You see me struggling there?

981
00:35:55,724 --> 00:35:57,904
That's me thinking
about the kiss.

982
00:35:57,896 --> 00:35:59,896
- [chuckles]
- [chuckles nervously]

983
00:35:59,896 --> 00:36:01,716
I think Charlene might wanna
kiss tonight.

984
00:36:01,724 --> 00:36:03,214
<i>Feeling kinda nervous
about this.</i>

985
00:36:03,206 --> 00:36:05,786
<i>Takes a little while for me
to sort of, like...</i>

986
00:36:05,793 --> 00:36:07,313
you know, take my armor off

987
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:08,660
and get intimate with someone.

988
00:36:08,965 --> 00:36:10,825
Um...

989
00:36:10,827 --> 00:36:13,587
Do you wanna walk over to,
maybe, the beach side?

990
00:36:13,586 --> 00:36:15,716
You know, look at the beach,
maybe find the moon somewhere?

991
00:36:15,724 --> 00:36:17,074
Okay, that would be awesome.

992
00:36:17,931 --> 00:36:19,211
I...

993
00:36:19,206 --> 00:36:21,026
still kinda need
to feel this out.

994
00:36:21,034 --> 00:36:23,214
[Charlene] How did your hand
get so cold?

995
00:36:23,206 --> 00:36:24,136
[Ryan S] Um...

996
00:36:26,241 --> 00:36:29,311
I think you are
a magnificent woman.

997
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:31,310
It is really difficult for me

998
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:33,930
to choose between
Ryan and Jimmy.

999
00:36:33,931 --> 00:36:36,311
I really makes me not know
what to do.

1000
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:37,310
[sighs in exasperation]

1001
00:36:48,413 --> 00:36:51,073
[Ryan] <i>Jimmy's already
had his time with Pola.</i>

1002
00:36:51,068 --> 00:36:53,928
I feel like Pola's the person
for me.

1003
00:36:53,931 --> 00:36:56,451
<i>I feel like we've had
the deepest bond,</i>

1004
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:58,278
<i>doing this experience and...</i>

1005
00:36:58,275 --> 00:37:00,335
I'm literally putting it
on the line tonight.

1006
00:37:00,344 --> 00:37:02,454
I'm about to go hard.

1007
00:37:02,448 --> 00:37:03,788
Where are we going?

1008
00:37:03,793 --> 00:37:05,033
I don't know.

1009
00:37:05,034 --> 00:37:06,974
[Pola] <i>So, right now,
I'm a little bit confused...</i>

1010
00:37:06,965 --> 00:37:09,135
because I had a great time
with Jimmy

1011
00:37:09,137 --> 00:37:10,137
and I'm expecting

1012
00:37:10,137 --> 00:37:12,067
to have a great time
with Ryan as well.

1013
00:37:12,068 --> 00:37:13,478
<i>I really like them both.</i>

1014
00:37:13,482 --> 00:37:15,762
<i>They're so different,
one from the other one.</i>

1015
00:37:15,758 --> 00:37:18,138
It's really complex,
what I feel.

1016
00:37:18,137 --> 00:37:19,787
But I don't wanna hurt
anybody's feelings.

1017
00:37:19,793 --> 00:37:21,663
<i>So, hopefully Ryan's date</i>

1018
00:37:21,655 --> 00:37:22,965
<i>will help me make up my mind.</i>

1019
00:37:24,517 --> 00:37:25,897
Oh, my God.

1020
00:37:25,896 --> 00:37:26,966
This is beautiful.

1021
00:37:26,965 --> 00:37:28,405
- [Ryan] You like it?
- [Pola] Yes.

1022
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:29,413
- [Ryan] Really?
- [Pola] Thank you so much.

1023
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:30,453
[Ryan] I'm glad you like it.

1024
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:31,998
Let's eat. Let's take a seat.

1025
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:37,310
I think Ryan is really
special because...

1026
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:39,690
he thought a lot
about this date...

1027
00:37:39,689 --> 00:37:42,859
<i>and he made everything
so perfect.</i>

1028
00:37:42,862 --> 00:37:45,312
And that's something
that really makes me happy.

1029
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:46,410
Oh, my God. This is beautiful.

1030
00:37:48,827 --> 00:37:50,097
You know?

1031
00:37:50,103 --> 00:37:51,283
How can you beat that, right?

1032
00:37:51,275 --> 00:37:53,275
I haven't taken the time.

1033
00:37:53,275 --> 00:37:54,925
But if you wanna
paint the moon...

1034
00:37:54,931 --> 00:37:55,931
[chuckles softly]

1035
00:37:55,931 --> 00:37:58,281
...I did bring a canvas

- So, we can look right here.

1038
00:38:02,379 --> 00:38:04,859
- Okay...
- And this little picture...

1039
00:38:04,862 --> 00:38:07,412
- and we can paint the moon.
- Are you a good painter?

1040
00:38:07,413 --> 00:38:08,663
It doesn't matter.

1041
00:38:08,655 --> 00:38:10,995
- Okay... yeah.
- I'mma be honest,
we gonna do it together.

1042
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,660
But I know how much...

1043
00:38:12,655 --> 00:38:15,515
you're into your hi-fives...

1044
00:38:15,517 --> 00:38:17,787

1045
00:38:17,793 --> 00:38:19,483
<i>This has been really good.</i>

1046
00:38:19,482 --> 00:38:20,762
<i>- This has been good.
- I like this...</i>

1047
00:38:20,758 --> 00:38:22,238
<i>- Don't give the "friend hand"
on a date.</i>
- [chuckles]

<i>Don't you "Jimmy" me.</i>

1049
00:38:23,896 --> 00:38:26,516
- [chuckles]
- So, we should fingerpaint.

1050
00:38:26,517 --> 00:38:27,657
- Yeah, yeah, yeah...
- 'Cause I know...

1051
00:38:27,655 --> 00:38:29,825
how much you like
your hi-fives.

1052
00:38:29,827 --> 00:38:31,207
- I like that.
- So, we can...

1053
00:38:31,206 --> 00:38:33,406

if you want to...

1054
00:38:33,413 --> 00:38:34,523
But if you don't wanna
do that yet...

1055
00:38:34,517 --> 00:38:35,547
No, let's do that first.

1056
00:38:35,551 --> 00:38:36,481
- You wanna paint?
- Yeah.

1061
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,760
that makes me really happy
that he observes so much.

1062
00:38:48,379 --> 00:38:49,719
You can do this side

1063
00:38:49,724 --> 00:38:51,724
and I'll do this side, okay?

1064
00:38:51,724 --> 00:38:53,384
- And let's see...
- And then we gotta
put them together? Okay.

1065
00:38:57,586 --> 00:38:59,546
- Is this still my side or not?
- Uh-huh.

1066
00:39:00,241 --> 00:39:01,861
This is your side.

1067
00:39:01,862 --> 00:39:02,902
[Ryan] I like that.

1068
00:39:04,137 --> 00:39:05,757
- You're pretty good with this.
- You're good, right?

1069
00:39:05,758 --> 00:39:07,308
You're actually pretty good
with this, so...

1070
00:39:08,827 --> 00:39:11,407
I'm enjoying
my time here, actually.

1071
00:39:11,413 --> 00:39:12,453
I don't wanna go.

1072
00:39:13,448 --> 00:39:14,898
Not now. I don't wanna leave.

1073
00:39:14,896 --> 00:39:16,446
- Then don't leave.
- No, I'm not gonna leave.

1074
00:39:16,448 --> 00:39:18,308
- Stay here with me.
- I am.

1075

So, creative activity
number two...

1084
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:45,143
So, what I attempted to do
is this...

1085
00:39:45,137 --> 00:39:47,307
I started to make a song
for you...

1086
00:39:48,172 --> 00:39:49,412
And what I did was...

1087
00:39:49,413 --> 00:39:50,343
This is so exciting.

1088
00:39:50,344 --> 00:39:52,214
I attempted to translate it
to Spanish.

1089
