00:00:00,862 --> 00:00:01,762
[April J] Previously

2
00:00:01,758 --> 00:00:02,688
<i>on</i> MILF Manor,

3
00:00:02,689 --> 00:00:04,859
Ladies, where's
all the men at?

4
00:00:04,862 --> 00:00:07,382
I think it's my time
to find love. I really do.

5
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:10,279
<i>Are we looking for love?
Are we looking for romance?</i>

6
00:00:10,275 --> 00:00:12,475
All of my moments
have led me to this one.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,170
You're the baby.

8
00:00:14,172 --> 00:00:15,762
And you're gonna be 22, right?

9
00:00:15,758 --> 00:00:17,408
I'm gonna be 22.

10
00:00:17,413 --> 00:00:19,343
- Whoo!
- [laughs]

11
00:00:19,344 --> 00:00:22,104
April is the woman
who immediately caught my eye.

12
00:00:22,103 --> 00:00:23,213
<i>Maybe I could show her</i>

13
00:00:23,206 --> 00:00:24,856
what it's like
with a younger man.

14
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:28,097
He's not going anywhere
near my mother.

15
00:00:29,241 --> 00:00:31,281
It's time to play
"Wall of Secrets."

16
00:00:31,275 --> 00:00:35,375
"I slept
with my son's best friend."
That's unacceptable.

17
00:00:35,379 --> 00:00:39,479
"I had a seven-woman orgy."
Could that be my mom?

18
00:00:39,482 --> 00:00:42,662
My secret is,
I slept with your best friend.

19
00:00:42,655 --> 00:00:44,965
[all exclaiming]

20
00:00:44,965 --> 00:00:47,655
<i>This one hurts deep. This one
I did not see coming at all.</i>

21
00:00:49,137 --> 00:00:50,787
I didn't expect this at all.

22
00:00:50,793 --> 00:00:53,003
<i>I'm hoping he will forgive me.</i>

23
00:00:54,379 --> 00:00:56,099
Have you ever dated
older women?

24
00:00:56,103 --> 00:00:58,343
I've had my eye on Jose
from day one.

25
00:00:58,344 --> 00:01:00,284
<i>I'm definitely going for it.</i>

26
00:01:00,275 --> 00:01:01,825
- Pola.
- Yes?

27
00:01:01,827 --> 00:01:03,097
I'm taking your son out
on a date.

28
00:01:03,103 --> 00:01:04,033
When?

29
00:01:04,034 --> 00:01:06,484
Kelle is not
the type of girl for Jose.

30
00:01:06,482 --> 00:01:08,172
I'm 100% sure.

31
00:01:09,241 --> 00:01:12,031
[in Spanish]

32
00:01:12,034 --> 00:01:13,724
[Kelle] <i>I don't know
what they're talking about.</i>

33
00:01:13,724 --> 00:01:15,344
- Maybe they're talking
about us.
- Yeah.

34
00:01:15,344 --> 00:01:17,524
- No speaking in Spanish!
We don't know.
- I heard...

35
00:01:17,517 --> 00:01:19,687
The majority doesn't know
what you're saying.

36
00:01:19,689 --> 00:01:21,969
She becomes like fire.

37
00:01:21,965 --> 00:01:24,235
- You're excluding people
is what you're doing.
- [Pola] No!

38
00:01:24,241 --> 00:01:26,931
- No.
- She's shouting at me,
just like...

39
00:01:26,931 --> 00:01:29,901
Hopefully, you're gonna
leave Kelle just, by the side.

40
00:01:31,862 --> 00:01:32,692
[bleeping]

41
00:01:47,379 --> 00:01:48,379
I'm being greedy right now.

42
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:49,339
I want a pancake, too,

43
00:01:49,344 --> 00:01:50,344
but I already have
a quesadilla,

44
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:51,794
which is a bread.

45
00:01:51,793 --> 00:01:55,863
Wow. I ate a pancake
and a half, almost, too,

46
00:01:55,862 --> 00:01:58,212
and I'm feeling like
it's too much carbs right now.

47
00:02:02,275 --> 00:02:04,335
[Kelle] <i>Last night,
with Pola and Stefany,</i>

48
00:02:04,344 --> 00:02:06,314
<i>there was
tensions running hot.</i>

49
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,550
Speaking Spanish
after I asked them to stop?

50
00:02:08,551 --> 00:02:09,971
It's like, hello?

51
00:02:09,965 --> 00:02:11,965
I'm sorry,
should I tell you in Spanish,

52
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,445
just shut the [bleep] up ?

53
00:02:13,448 --> 00:02:14,548
[chuckles]

54
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,141
Just say that in Spanish.

55
00:02:16,137 --> 00:02:17,307
<i>Callate.</i>

56
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,170
[chuckles]

57
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:20,656
<i>Honestly, I really am</i>

58
00:02:20,655 --> 00:02:21,995
<i>over the whole
speaking Spanish thing.</i>

59
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,930
<i>I could care less.</i>

60
00:02:22,931 --> 00:02:23,971
If they want
to keep speaking it,

61
00:02:23,965 --> 00:02:24,895
keep speaking it.

62
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,066
If they want to stop,
they'll stop.

63
00:02:26,068 --> 00:02:27,168
They know how I feel.

64
00:02:27,172 --> 00:02:28,692
<i>I'm over it.</i>

65
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:30,829
I'm definitely
going to apologize,

66
00:02:30,827 --> 00:02:32,587
and bury the hatchet,
so we can move on.

67
00:02:41,413 --> 00:02:42,903
Oh, there she is.

68
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:44,066
[Stefany] Hey, what's up?

69
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,830
You ready to finish
what we started last night?

70
00:02:47,827 --> 00:02:50,547
- Girl, you're...
What's up?
- I'm just kidding.

71
00:02:50,551 --> 00:02:51,481
- Aw!
- I love you.

72
00:02:51,482 --> 00:02:53,312
I love you, too.

73
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,760
No Spanish talk, right?

74
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,378
[chuckles]

75
00:02:56,379 --> 00:02:57,479
You're silly.

76
00:02:57,482 --> 00:03:00,932
<i>I don't know if Kelle's
genuine this morning.</i>

77
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:03,721
Maybe she's just trying
to get closer to our sons.

78
00:03:03,724 --> 00:03:06,314
I think at this point,
I just might

79
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,970
keep my guard up,
a little bit,

80
00:03:07,965 --> 00:03:11,135
just to see what
this is all about.

81
00:03:12,034 --> 00:03:12,934
I'll teach you.

82
00:03:12,931 --> 00:03:15,381
Before we leave,
you're gonna learn it all.

83
00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:17,519
- [Kelle] Perfect. I love you.
- <i>Mamacita.</i>

84
00:03:17,517 --> 00:03:19,207
- Say <i>mamacita.</i>
- <i>Mamacita.</i>

85
00:03:19,206 --> 00:03:20,306
<i>Soy una mamacita.</i>

86
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,340
<i>Soy yo mamacita.</i>

87
00:03:21,344 --> 00:03:22,454
[Stefany chuckles]

88
00:03:22,448 --> 00:03:24,028
[laughs]

89
00:03:24,689 --> 00:03:25,549
All right, girl.

90
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:28,406
Literal, no. No, no.

91
00:03:28,413 --> 00:03:29,383
No, no, no. Of course.

92
00:03:33,758 --> 00:03:34,968
When she came close to me,

93
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:36,335
I thought
she was gonna scream again.

94
00:03:37,034 --> 00:03:38,104
Good morning.

95
00:03:38,103 --> 00:03:39,593
- I apologize for last night.
- [Pola] No, don't worry.

96
00:03:40,931 --> 00:03:43,241
Kelle apologizing
made me realize

97
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:44,971
that she is actually

98
00:03:44,965 --> 00:03:47,025
<i>smart enough
to recognize her mistakes,</i>

99
00:03:47,034 --> 00:03:49,314
<i>but at this point,
I'm also open</i>

100
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,590
to getting to know
the other women in the villa.

101
00:03:55,413 --> 00:03:57,863
[Pola] <i>I'm watching Kelle,
because I just want</i>

102
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,552
to make sure
everything is fine,

103
00:03:59,551 --> 00:04:01,281
and everyone is good.

104
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:02,715
I watch myself.

105
00:04:02,724 --> 00:04:04,074
I know. I know.

106
00:04:07,724 --> 00:04:08,694
Bam.

107
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:09,829
[chuckles]

108
00:04:09,827 --> 00:04:11,447
Cheers to Spanish speaking.
[chuckles]

109
00:04:11,448 --> 00:04:12,378
[Kelle] Do you know what?

110
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:14,099
The funny part is,
is it's my fault,

111
00:04:14,103 --> 00:04:16,763
because I actually took
Spanish classes, like...

112
00:04:16,758 --> 00:04:19,478
I started taking it,
and then I quit,

113
00:04:19,482 --> 00:04:20,552
and now, you know what?

114
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:21,621
- It bit me on the ass.
- Yeah.

115
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,760
So what happens if you meet
this, like, hot stud

116
00:04:24,758 --> 00:04:26,408
that only speaks Spanish?

117
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,447
[Kelle] Then we just
make love. [laughs]

118
00:04:36,655 --> 00:04:37,545
How are you doing, king?

119
00:04:37,551 --> 00:04:39,101
Bro, I'm doing good.

120
00:04:39,103 --> 00:04:41,283
[Gabriel] The secrets
and [bleep] , you know,

121
00:04:41,275 --> 00:04:44,135
kind of hit home for people,
and I was like, "Damn.

122
00:04:44,137 --> 00:04:45,407
It might be a little annoying

123
00:04:45,413 --> 00:04:46,973
<i>finding out
your mom did that</i>[bleep] .

124
00:04:46,965 --> 00:04:48,615
<i>I was just checking in,</i>

125
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,140
if you wanted
to talk about it,

126
00:04:50,137 --> 00:04:51,067
or something, you know?

127
00:04:51,068 --> 00:04:53,448
The most shocking secret,
for sure,

128
00:04:53,448 --> 00:04:56,758
was Jimmy finding out his mom
[bleep] his best friend.

129
00:04:56,758 --> 00:04:57,968
Did that kind of
bother you a little bit?

130
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,585
Oh, yeah,
it bothers me, obviously.

131
00:05:00,103 --> 00:05:01,033
It's odd.

132
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:01,974
For one, I didn't know,

133
00:05:01,965 --> 00:05:02,965
for two, it's supposed to,

134
00:05:02,965 --> 00:05:04,205
apparently, like,
my best friend,

135
00:05:04,206 --> 00:05:05,926
and for three,
now everybody knows.

136
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:07,931
Imagine you in my shoes,
you know what I mean?

137
00:05:07,931 --> 00:05:09,171
[Gabriel] I'd be
pretty pissed.

138
00:05:09,172 --> 00:05:10,862
<i>If you made a mistake,
or something,</i>

139
00:05:10,862 --> 00:05:12,862
when I was younger, whatever,

140
00:05:12,862 --> 00:05:15,622
but for you to, like,
tell me in front of strangers

141
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,620
would kind of be,
like, embarrassing.

142
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,280
I definitely would have said
something to my son

143
00:05:21,275 --> 00:05:24,965
if I was going to reveal that
to a group of people.

144
00:05:24,965 --> 00:05:26,335
- [Jimmy] Come on.
- I would probably fly home.

145
00:05:26,344 --> 00:05:27,284
- I'm not kidding.
- [Jimmy] Yeah.

146
00:05:27,275 --> 00:05:28,235
- I would fly home.
- [Jimmy] Yeah.

147
00:05:28,241 --> 00:05:29,451
Yeah.

148
00:05:29,448 --> 00:05:31,828
[Gabriel] <i>I think maybe
he should talk to Soyoung,</i>

149
00:05:31,827 --> 00:05:34,277
because that's a bomb to drop.

150
00:05:34,275 --> 00:05:36,925
If you just want to have
a conversation that's private,

151
00:05:36,931 --> 00:05:38,171
I'm always here to talk.

152
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:41,932
I'm just trying to get
a little lit tonight.

153
00:05:41,931 --> 00:05:45,621
I think that
revealing the secret

154
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,480
was very hard for me.

155
00:05:47,482 --> 00:05:49,662
I don't know how
you feel towards me.

156
00:05:49,655 --> 00:05:51,685
Are you saying
you don't know how I feel?

157
00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:53,309
How would you feel,
is the question.

158
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,690
I'm angry.

159
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:56,519
I don't know how
to even look at you,

160
00:05:56,517 --> 00:05:57,757
and talk to you

161
00:05:57,758 --> 00:06:01,788
in a sensible manner, where
I can be your son right now.

162
00:06:01,793 --> 00:06:04,003
I feel like
you didn't treat me
like your son.

163
00:06:06,448 --> 00:06:08,168
Well, I am so sorry.

164
00:06:08,172 --> 00:06:10,212
I never even think that way,

165
00:06:10,206 --> 00:06:13,446
that I'm put in your shoes.

166
00:06:16,103 --> 00:06:17,343
- [Gabriel] But, cheers.
- Cheers.

167
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:18,384
- I love you.
- I love you, dude.

168
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:19,759
- [kisses]
- I love you.

169
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:23,995
[Shannan] Bye.

170
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,030
<i>Vamonos!</i>

171
00:06:25,034 --> 00:06:26,244
All right, we know.
Just kidding.

172
00:06:26,241 --> 00:06:27,521
<i>Adios.</i>

173
00:06:27,517 --> 00:06:28,897
As yesterday's winners

174
00:06:28,896 --> 00:06:30,826
of the "Wall of Secrets"
challenge,

175
00:06:30,827 --> 00:06:33,547
<i>Ryan, Joey, and myself
got to choose</i>

176
00:06:33,551 --> 00:06:35,721
whoever we want
to take out on a date tonight.

177
00:06:36,551 --> 00:06:38,341
Stefany!
[all cheering]

178
00:06:38,344 --> 00:06:40,384
I choose Pola.

179
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:41,999
I'm going with April tonight.

180
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,690
- [all exclaiming]
- [all cheering]

181
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:46,209
[Gabriel] <i>I'm excited
for my first date.</i>

182
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:47,586
<i>I get to go out of the villa,</i>

183
00:06:47,586 --> 00:06:49,376
<i>and I get alone time
with Stefany.</i>

184
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:50,689
I've never been
on a double date

185
00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:51,589
with my mom before.

186
00:06:51,586 --> 00:06:53,026
[laughs]

187
00:06:53,034 --> 00:06:56,314
- It definitely doesn't seem
like my mom's vibe.
- I'm with Joey.

188
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,550
He's 20.

189
00:06:57,551 --> 00:07:01,621
And he's such a gentleman,
which I really like in a man.

190
00:07:03,275 --> 00:07:06,275
[festive
Mexican music playing]

191
00:07:08,482 --> 00:07:11,002
Whoo-hoo!

192
00:07:15,379 --> 00:07:17,789
[Joey] <i>I picked April
because I love her vibe.</i>

193
00:07:17,793 --> 00:07:20,073
<i>I love her energy.</i>

194
00:07:20,068 --> 00:07:22,998
Not only does April have

195
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,310
<i>a beautiful face,
beautiful body,</i>

196
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,760
<i>she has a great personality,</i>

197
00:07:26,758 --> 00:07:28,758
but she's also very wise.

198
00:07:28,758 --> 00:07:30,788
<i>She could teach me
many things.</i>

199
00:07:30,793 --> 00:07:32,103
<i>It's very attractive</i>

200
00:07:32,103 --> 00:07:34,553
that she has
a lot of life experience.

201
00:07:34,551 --> 00:07:35,481
[chuckles]

202
00:07:35,482 --> 00:07:37,622
Welcome
to La Miserable Mezcaleria.

203
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,550
Take a seat.

204
00:07:38,551 --> 00:07:39,971
<i>Vamos.</i>

205
00:07:39,965 --> 00:07:42,755
Stefany caught my eye
because she just seems

206
00:07:42,758 --> 00:07:45,758
so sweet, and I think
she's super pretty.

207
00:07:45,758 --> 00:07:47,758
<i>She seems like
a well put together gal,</i>

208
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:49,928
so I could definitely,

209
00:07:49,931 --> 00:07:51,411
you know,
be interested in that.

210
00:07:51,413 --> 00:07:52,693
Thank you.

211
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:56,449
I picked Pola because
she's very nice on the eyes,

212
00:07:56,448 --> 00:07:57,928
personality-wise,
very warm,

213
00:07:57,931 --> 00:07:59,481
<i>very inviting,
very exciting.</i>

214
00:07:59,482 --> 00:08:00,932
Banging body, too.

215
00:08:01,896 --> 00:08:02,826
[waiter] I will explain to you

216
00:08:02,827 --> 00:08:04,717
a little bit
about mescal today.

217
00:08:04,724 --> 00:08:06,484
What you have today
are three different mescals

218
00:08:06,482 --> 00:08:08,312
from three different parts
of Mexico.

219
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:10,140
You have also
a little bit of crickets.

220
00:08:10,137 --> 00:08:11,857
Yes, crickets,
edible crickets.

221
00:08:11,862 --> 00:08:13,072
- You can peel it...
- [gags]

222
00:08:13,068 --> 00:08:15,098
[waiter] ...and eat it,
that is, removing the legs...

223
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,383
- [Pola] Ugh!
- [waiter] ...or you can
eat it whole.

224
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:18,659
[Joey] <i>It was actually
the very first time</i>

225
00:08:18,655 --> 00:08:20,135
<i>I've seen crickets</i>

226
00:08:20,137 --> 00:08:21,927
on a dinner table like that.
[chuckles]

227
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:25,999
If I'm gonna try them
with anyone, it'll be April J.

228
00:08:27,413 --> 00:08:30,073
- How do you like them?
- I didn't realize
that they were so, like,

229
00:08:30,068 --> 00:08:31,378
- crickety.
- [Joey laughing]
Totally, yeah!

230
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:32,619
They're so crickety.

231
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,620
Ahhh!

232
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,760
- [both laugh]
- God!

233
00:08:36,827 --> 00:08:38,137
Come on, you have to.

234
00:08:38,137 --> 00:08:40,657
[Pola]

235
00:08:40,655 --> 00:08:43,685
I really enjoy that Ryan
is more secure about himself,

236
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,899
<i>and I knew he was more mature.</i>

237
00:08:45,896 --> 00:08:48,236
It's good that he asked me out
on this date.

238
00:08:48,241 --> 00:08:50,521
- [laughs]
- It's disgusting!

239
00:08:51,241 --> 00:08:52,721
<i>Salud</i>, everyone.

240
00:08:52,724 --> 00:08:53,594
<i>Salud.</i>

241
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,524
- [Stefany chuckling]
Oh, no, no!
- [spits]

242
00:08:58,655 --> 00:09:00,235
[Stefany] What happened?

243
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,590
[Gabriel] Open your mouth,
close your eyes.

244
00:09:04,965 --> 00:09:06,615
Ahhh! [chuckles]

245
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,550
Gabriel's throwing crickets,
and, you know,

246
00:09:09,551 --> 00:09:10,621
getting grossed out,

247
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,280
and kind of being immature
about the situation.

248
00:09:12,275 --> 00:09:15,305
<i>It comes off
a bit disrespectful
to act that way.</i>

249
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:19,660
I'm not seeing
what Stefany's seeing in him.

250
00:09:19,655 --> 00:09:22,205
I'm not understanding
how he's gonna find

251
00:09:22,206 --> 00:09:25,136
an older woman that
will actually be interested

252
00:09:25,137 --> 00:09:28,307
in seriously dating him,
just being that childish.

253
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:30,790
From what I'm seeing,
she's sitting with a man-baby.

254
00:09:34,068 --> 00:09:35,098
[Joey] Hey!

255
00:09:35,103 --> 00:09:37,313
That's what you get
for asking my mom on a date!

256
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,140
- [bleeping] [laughs]
- [Joey] Hey!

257
00:09:39,137 --> 00:09:40,967
[Gabriel] <i>Joey's
a little sly guy,</i>

258
00:09:40,965 --> 00:09:43,655
and now, he's trying
to hit on my mom,

259
00:09:43,655 --> 00:09:44,925
and it's not sitting right
with me.

260
00:09:44,931 --> 00:09:46,141
It's not sitting pretty.

261
00:09:46,137 --> 00:09:47,717
[Joey] Wow.

262
00:09:47,724 --> 00:09:48,974
- Hey.
- [chuckling] Calm down.

263
00:09:48,965 --> 00:09:50,855
- You're the most intriguing
person in the house.
- Aw!

264
00:09:50,862 --> 00:09:52,142
I want to be with Jose.

265
00:09:52,137 --> 00:09:53,587
- I love my son.
- Okay.

266
00:09:53,586 --> 00:09:57,376
It is a bit of mama's boy
going on with Jose and Pola.

267
00:10:07,034 --> 00:10:07,934
[Gabriel] Have you
ever thought

268
00:10:07,931 --> 00:10:09,211
you could date, like,
a younger guy?

269
00:10:09,206 --> 00:10:11,406
Yeah. For sure.

270
00:10:11,413 --> 00:10:12,593
[Gabriel] What do you like
about me?

271
00:10:12,586 --> 00:10:15,996
Your vibe,
it's so, you know...

272
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,240
I think it's the energy.

273
00:10:18,241 --> 00:10:19,591
I love your eyes.

274
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:20,446
Hmm?

275
00:10:21,862 --> 00:10:22,902
They're cute.

276
00:10:22,896 --> 00:10:24,376
[Stefany] How about you?

277
00:10:24,379 --> 00:10:26,029
Why did you pick me
to go out on a date?

278
00:10:27,206 --> 00:10:29,896
I thought you were
the prettiest. Like, my type.

279
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:31,166
Thank you.

280
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:34,032
It would be fun to actually
get to know you a little bit.

281
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,100
<i>I make music. I'm an artist.</i>

282
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:39,933
I do modeling as well.
I travel a lot, so...

283
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:43,521
<i>I'd say my ideal girl needs
to be kind of well-rounded,</i>

284
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:47,027
intelligent, really just
a happy, positive person.

285
00:10:47,034 --> 00:10:49,594
What's your, like,
best date idea?

286
00:10:49,586 --> 00:10:52,896
- Best, if you had to come up
with a dream date.
- I'm really simple.

287
00:10:52,896 --> 00:10:57,406
I think, just like a nice,
I think, conversation,

288
00:10:57,413 --> 00:10:59,213
and some candles.

289
00:10:59,206 --> 00:11:01,686
I feel like talking to Stefany
the first five minutes,

290
00:11:01,689 --> 00:11:03,829
I could already tell
she's independent,

291
00:11:03,827 --> 00:11:06,967
she's strong, so I'm
definitely interested in that.

292
00:11:06,965 --> 00:11:08,095
To getting to know each other.

293
00:11:08,103 --> 00:11:09,283
Yes.

294
00:11:09,275 --> 00:11:10,615
<i>- Salud.
- Salud.</i>

295
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,720
[Stefany] <i>I've never dated
anyone like Gabriel.</i>

296
00:11:12,724 --> 00:11:15,414
He's stylish,
he's spontaneous,

297
00:11:15,413 --> 00:11:20,173
<i>He's very funny, outgoing.
He just says it how it is.</i>

298
00:11:20,172 --> 00:11:24,792
I am excited to see
what God has in store for us.

299
00:11:24,793 --> 00:11:27,863
- Oh, you're the best.
- [exhales]

300
00:11:27,862 --> 00:11:29,902
[April J] What are the effects
of these crickets?

301
00:11:29,896 --> 00:11:31,276
- Are there some type of...
- [Joey] Yes.

302
00:11:31,275 --> 00:11:33,305
- Are they aphrodisiacs, or...
- Psychedelic? [chuckles]

303
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:36,280
- [April J] What is it?
- [Joey] I mean, I'm assuming
they bring good luck,

304
00:11:36,275 --> 00:11:37,405
and good love.

305
00:11:37,413 --> 00:11:38,383
[chuckles]

306
00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:40,409
[April J] Maybe.

307
00:11:40,413 --> 00:11:41,973
[Gabriel] <i>Joey's
a little sly guy,</i>

308
00:11:41,965 --> 00:11:43,925
<i>and now, he's trying
to hit on my mom,</i>

309
00:11:44,724 --> 00:11:46,074
and it's not sitting right
with me.

310
00:11:46,068 --> 00:11:47,278
It's not sitting pretty.

311
00:11:47,275 --> 00:11:49,965
I would have never thought
that I would be here

312
00:11:49,965 --> 00:11:51,895
with such a beautiful woman.

313
00:11:51,896 --> 00:11:54,786
I think I'm
the oldest mom in the house,

314
00:11:54,793 --> 00:11:58,483
and Joey is
the youngest man in the house,

315
00:11:58,482 --> 00:11:59,762
<i>but Joey's so sweet,</i>

316
00:11:59,758 --> 00:12:02,688
<i>and complimentary,
and sensitive.</i>

317
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:05,069
He's actually acting
more like a man

318
00:12:05,068 --> 00:12:07,518
than most men twice his age.

319
00:12:07,517 --> 00:12:09,307
Just because, you know,

320
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:12,000
my license says this,
and your license says that...

321
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,970
[Joey] Mmm-hmm.

322
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:14,855
I'm sure you have
a license, right?

323
00:12:14,862 --> 00:12:16,142
[both laugh]

324
00:12:16,137 --> 00:12:16,997
[Gabriel] Mom!

325
00:12:17,931 --> 00:12:19,521
How's your date going?
[chuckles]

326
00:12:20,344 --> 00:12:21,594
Oh, it's going great.

327
00:12:22,172 --> 00:12:23,832
Don't get her too wasted.

328
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:26,477
- I'm trying to have
my date. "Mom!"
- [laughs]

329
00:12:26,482 --> 00:12:27,722
- [Gabriel] Mom,
it's about my date.
-"Mom!"

330
00:12:27,724 --> 00:12:29,384
- [Gabriel] it's
about our date, okay?
-"Mom!"

331
00:12:29,379 --> 00:12:30,589
[Joey] "Mom!" "Mom!"

332
00:12:30,586 --> 00:12:33,026
<i>I'm not intimidated at all
by having Gabriel around.</i>

333
00:12:33,034 --> 00:12:36,594
Well, I think Gabriel's
honestly annoyed with me.

334
00:12:36,586 --> 00:12:39,136
<i>He doesn't like whatever
is going on at my table.</i>

335
00:12:39,137 --> 00:12:40,687
<i>That boy better watch out.</i>

336
00:12:40,689 --> 00:12:42,309
I'm gonna be his papa one day.

337
00:12:43,103 --> 00:12:44,413
Hey!

338
00:12:44,413 --> 00:12:46,003
- That's what you get
for asking my mom on a date!
- [Joey] Hey!

339
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,030
[bleeping]

340
00:12:47,034 --> 00:12:48,314
- [bleeping] [laughs]
- [Joey] Hey!

341
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,830
- [Stefany chuckling]
Calm down.
- [Ryan] <i>Wow.</i>

342
00:12:50,827 --> 00:12:53,587
<i>I'm tired of watching
Gabriel be corny.</i>

343
00:12:53,586 --> 00:12:56,136
You know? I just want to
kind of be in my own vibes,

344
00:12:56,137 --> 00:12:58,027
right now, with Pola,
and just really, you know,

345
00:12:58,034 --> 00:12:59,974
<i>experience this date
for what it can be,</i>

346
00:12:59,965 --> 00:13:01,615
so I was,
"It's time to take a walk."

347
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,790
- All right,
let's walk, and talk.
- Let's go.

348
00:13:03,793 --> 00:13:06,103
Thanks. You don't want
to take the empanada?

349
00:13:06,103 --> 00:13:07,383
- I'm all set.
- [laughs]

350
00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:09,589
[Ryan] <i>Obviously,
I think Pola's attractive.</i>

351
00:13:09,586 --> 00:13:13,236
I think her energy
is much younger than her age.

352
00:13:13,241 --> 00:13:14,141
[Pola] <i>Vamos.</i>

353
00:13:14,137 --> 00:13:15,477
- [Ryan] Okay.
- [chuckles]

354
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,620
[in Spanish]

355
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:22,240
That is the reason why I want
to get to know Pola better.

356
00:13:22,241 --> 00:13:24,071
I'm not gonna have crickets.

357
00:13:24,068 --> 00:13:27,718
I'm never gonna do that.
Never, ever. Never.

358
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:30,724
- Well, you missed out.
It was so much fun.
- It's fine. It's fine.

359
00:13:30,724 --> 00:13:31,664
It's okay with me.

360
00:13:31,655 --> 00:13:33,515
So now, anyways,
on a serious note,

361
00:13:33,517 --> 00:13:34,787
I brought you out tonight

362
00:13:34,793 --> 00:13:36,453
because to me, personally,

363
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:38,478
- you're the most intriguing
person in the house.
- Aw!

364
00:13:38,482 --> 00:13:40,722
[Ryan] You have
a lot of confidence,

365
00:13:40,724 --> 00:13:42,864
I think
you're absolutely gorgeous,

366
00:13:42,862 --> 00:13:44,282
and I think, most importantly,

367
00:13:44,275 --> 00:13:46,445
internally
you're a great person,

368
00:13:46,448 --> 00:13:48,378
- and that's extremely
attractive to me.
- Thank you.

369
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:54,760
When he looks at me, like,
he feels really confident,

370
00:13:54,758 --> 00:13:56,238
and that becomes really sexy.

371
00:13:56,758 --> 00:13:57,658
So, in your eyes,

372
00:13:57,655 --> 00:13:59,025
what's your purpose
at the house?

373
00:14:00,448 --> 00:14:01,278
Right now?

374
00:14:02,724 --> 00:14:05,174
I really want
to enjoy my company.

375
00:14:05,172 --> 00:14:06,002
[Ryan] Okay.

376
00:14:06,689 --> 00:14:07,859
I really love myself.

377
00:14:08,344 --> 00:14:09,174
[Ryan] Okay.

378
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,340
So, I want to be
with myself first,

379
00:14:12,344 --> 00:14:14,104
than being
with anybody else.

380
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,453
[Ryan] Okay.

381
00:14:15,448 --> 00:14:18,338
Then, I want to be
with Jose.

382
00:14:18,344 --> 00:14:19,864
- I love my son.
- Okay.

383
00:14:19,862 --> 00:14:21,862
Jose is my guy, but it is...

384
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:25,552
It is a bit of mama's boy
going on with Jose and Pola.

385
00:14:25,551 --> 00:14:28,211
[Pola] And then,
I'm really open to anything.

386
00:14:28,206 --> 00:14:29,786
So, let me ask you this.
So far...

387
00:14:29,793 --> 00:14:31,973
- Yeah.
- ...out of all
of your dates, so far...

388
00:14:31,965 --> 00:14:33,685
This has been really good.

389
00:14:33,689 --> 00:14:34,859
- This has been good?
- I like mescal, yes.

390
00:14:34,862 --> 00:14:36,452
- Don't give me
the friend hand on the date.
- [laughs]

391
00:14:36,448 --> 00:14:37,998
Don't you Jimmy me.

392
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,170
<i>Pola, to me,
has the most question marks.</i>

393
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:42,995
<i>Is she here to date?</i>

394
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,450
You know,
'cause I am here to date,

395
00:14:45,448 --> 00:14:47,658
and you really have to be
on the same page

396
00:14:47,655 --> 00:14:49,655
with somebody to see

397
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:50,895
if you can
further progress with them.

398
00:14:52,724 --> 00:14:54,624
[kissing]

399
00:14:58,206 --> 00:14:59,236
[kisses]

400
00:14:59,241 --> 00:15:00,901
[Ryan] <i>If Pola is gonna
continue to be guarded,</i>

401
00:15:00,896 --> 00:15:02,336
obviously I gotta
keep it moving.

402
00:15:02,344 --> 00:15:04,694
Um, it's like the McRib
at McDonald's, you know?

403
00:15:04,689 --> 00:15:06,449
Like, "limited time only,"
you know? [laughs]

404
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,068
- All right, come on.
- That was great.

405
00:15:17,586 --> 00:15:18,756
- [guys laughing]
- <i>Salud.</i>

406
00:15:18,758 --> 00:15:20,098
<i>Salud.</i>

407
00:15:26,034 --> 00:15:27,764
[Gabriel] <i>"Salud,
salud, salud!"</i>

408
00:15:27,758 --> 00:15:29,408
- [Jose] That's my mama.
- [Gabriel laughs]

409
00:15:31,448 --> 00:15:32,998
So, are you loving it here?

410
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,900
Yeah. I'm super excited.

411
00:15:34,896 --> 00:15:36,276
I'm a very open-minded person.

412
00:15:36,275 --> 00:15:38,405
- [Kelle] Yeah.
- Very relaxed.

413
00:15:38,413 --> 00:15:40,283
"Go with the flow"
type of person.

414
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:42,545
[Kelle] I'm open
to anything, too.

415
00:15:43,551 --> 00:15:44,411
We have to be.

416
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:46,789
Even though
everything was great

417
00:15:46,793 --> 00:15:49,553
going to Mushroom Rock
with Jose on our first date,

418
00:15:49,551 --> 00:15:51,241
after the blowup,
now I feel like

419
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,381
he's avoiding me
like the plague, so...

420
00:15:53,379 --> 00:15:56,099
<i>I think that Jose
is definitely a mama's boy,
for sure.</i>

421
00:15:56,103 --> 00:15:58,383
I mean, if he's not going
to make an effort,

422
00:15:58,379 --> 00:15:59,589
<i>and he's just gonna let me go,</i>

423
00:15:59,586 --> 00:16:01,136
<i>then I'm gonna
keep moving forward,</i>

424
00:16:01,137 --> 00:16:03,587
so that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

425
00:16:03,586 --> 00:16:06,336
So, now I'm gonna see
what Billy's got going on.

426
00:16:06,344 --> 00:16:08,214
Have you dated younger before?

427
00:16:08,206 --> 00:16:09,756
Yeah.

428
00:16:09,758 --> 00:16:12,408
Do you prefer younger,
or older, around your age?

429
00:16:12,413 --> 00:16:13,413
[Kelle chuckles]

430
00:16:13,413 --> 00:16:15,863
I feel like younger guys
are a lot more open,

431
00:16:15,862 --> 00:16:20,552
and they don't have a lot of,
um, constraints, I think,

432
00:16:20,551 --> 00:16:21,481
on their thought process.

433
00:16:21,482 --> 00:16:22,932
They don't, like,
overthink things

434
00:16:22,931 --> 00:16:24,481
because of stuff that happened
to them in the past.

435
00:16:24,482 --> 00:16:26,622
- They're just more free
with, like...
- [Billy] Yeah.

436
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,590
...who they are,
and I feel like a lot of times

437
00:16:28,586 --> 00:16:31,786
they have more direction
on where they want to go.

438
00:16:32,344 --> 00:16:33,384
What about you?

439
00:16:33,379 --> 00:16:34,309
Um...

440
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,720
I don't really see
too much of an age thing.

441
00:16:39,724 --> 00:16:42,284
Age isn't really
a problem for me.

442
00:16:42,275 --> 00:16:44,785
Just like you,
connection is very important,

443
00:16:44,793 --> 00:16:46,413
the right chemistry.

444
00:16:46,413 --> 00:16:48,833
[Kelle] <i>The one thing
that I really love,</i>

445
00:16:48,827 --> 00:16:51,407
that's a big turn-on for me,
is a guy that puts in effort,

446
00:16:51,413 --> 00:16:53,453
and that actually shows
interest in me,

447
00:16:53,448 --> 00:16:55,278
so the fact
that Billy's actually showing

448
00:16:55,275 --> 00:16:57,895
interest in me, I'm kind of
open to exploring,

449
00:16:57,896 --> 00:16:59,306
you know, to see
if there's anything there.

450
00:17:03,862 --> 00:17:05,342
- [Ryan] What's that?
The pinot?
- You want one?

451
00:17:05,344 --> 00:17:07,144
Where's mine?

452
00:17:07,137 --> 00:17:08,687
[Ryan] It's coming.

453
00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:09,999
- [chuckles]
- [Ryan] I'm
about to bring it over.

454
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,310
- Thank you.
- You're killing yourself
that way, for them.

455
00:17:12,896 --> 00:17:13,786
Oh!

456
00:17:13,793 --> 00:17:14,933
[Stefany] Thank you.

457
00:17:14,931 --> 00:17:16,521
- [Ryan] Absolutely.
- [Stefany] You're so nice.

458
00:17:16,517 --> 00:17:18,027
[Ryan] I try to be.

459
00:17:18,034 --> 00:17:19,384
- Cheers.
- [Ryan] Cheers.

460
00:17:19,379 --> 00:17:21,689
<i>I feel like the date with Pola
goes pretty well,</i>

461
00:17:21,689 --> 00:17:24,829
<i>but I am here to date,
so I'm kind of shifting,</i>

462
00:17:24,827 --> 00:17:27,067
you know, my interest
at this point toward Stefany.

463
00:17:27,068 --> 00:17:28,758
Hopefully, I can show her
something different

464
00:17:28,758 --> 00:17:31,338
than she was experiencing
at the table with Gabriel.

465
00:17:31,344 --> 00:17:33,004
Do you date women with kids?

466
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,720
At my age,
I'm used to it now,

467
00:17:34,724 --> 00:17:37,034
but like, it's kind of, like,
the inconvenience

468
00:17:37,034 --> 00:17:40,864
- of trying to plan with you,
and spend time with you.
- [Stefany] Yeah.

469
00:17:40,862 --> 00:17:43,142
If I really like you,
I'm gonna make the time.

470
00:17:43,137 --> 00:17:45,687
[Ryan] <i>I think Stefany
is just naturally sexy,</i>

471
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:47,549
<i>and extremely
well put together.</i>

472
00:17:47,551 --> 00:17:49,481
<i>She's definitely
an eye talker,</i>

473
00:17:49,482 --> 00:17:51,482
<i>and that gets me every time.</i>

474
00:17:51,482 --> 00:17:53,142
Even though Stefany is older,

475
00:17:53,137 --> 00:17:55,857
she kind of has, like,
a young appeal.

476
00:17:55,862 --> 00:17:58,482
<i>She's obviously
an attractive woman.</i>

477
00:17:58,482 --> 00:18:00,412
Do you do online dating?

478
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,103
I've done it before.

479
00:18:02,103 --> 00:18:04,213
Do you do FaceTime
before you meet them?

480
00:18:04,206 --> 00:18:05,096
- [Ryan] Uh...
- Ah!

481
00:18:05,103 --> 00:18:06,383
I learned my lesson with that

482
00:18:06,379 --> 00:18:07,589
- a couple times before, so...
[chuckles]
- [Stefany] Yes!

483
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,096
I FaceTime like, all right,
you swiped? Let's FaceTime.

484
00:18:10,103 --> 00:18:12,103
- Like, yeah, let me see you.
- [Stefany chuckling] Right.

485
00:18:12,103 --> 00:18:15,243
Ryan is 30,
and actually, it works for me,

486
00:18:15,241 --> 00:18:17,691
because our communication
seemed to be

487
00:18:17,689 --> 00:18:18,719
on the same level,

488
00:18:18,724 --> 00:18:21,214
because he's the one
that's closest to my age,

489
00:18:21,206 --> 00:18:23,586
<i>and I felt
chemistry with Ryan.</i>

490
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,790
[Gabriel] <i>I don't know Ryan,
but I feel like</i>

491
00:18:28,793 --> 00:18:31,143
based off the first day
or two days,

492
00:18:31,137 --> 00:18:34,237
you know, he's hitting on
more than one girl,

493
00:18:34,241 --> 00:18:35,901
so I feel like that might show

494
00:18:35,896 --> 00:18:38,856
that, okay, yeah,
he's a little player type.

495
00:18:38,862 --> 00:18:39,832
<i>I'm someone who...</i>

496
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,477
<i>I don't really
get jealous that easily,</i>

497
00:18:41,482 --> 00:18:43,972
but I feel like Stefany and I
have something going,

498
00:18:43,965 --> 00:18:47,895
<i>so I feel like he kind of
needs to uh, you know,</i>

499
00:18:48,655 --> 00:18:50,205
stay out the way!
[chuckles]

500
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,900
I am a very good kisser.

501
00:18:55,896 --> 00:18:57,756
Would you like
to test it out?

502
00:18:57,758 --> 00:19:01,518
Billy's cute, but, um,
his game is super weak.

503
00:19:01,517 --> 00:19:02,547
You have food in your mouth!

504
00:19:02,551 --> 00:19:03,791
Now you're gonna kiss me
with food...

505
00:19:03,793 --> 00:19:05,143
[chuckles]

506
00:19:05,137 --> 00:19:07,097
Sorry, not happening.

507
00:19:07,103 --> 00:19:08,003
[Billy] I give up.

508
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,690
[laughs]

509
00:19:16,862 --> 00:19:18,482
[Kelle] <i>I think
Billy's attractive.</i>

510
00:19:18,482 --> 00:19:21,762

00:32:31,758 --> 00:32:33,308
- a little bit,
'cause your mom's there?
- Now awkward.

851
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,590
It was just, like,

852
00:32:34,586 --> 00:32:37,616
she's over there
with a...[chuckles]

853
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:40,480
- [laughs]
- ...with some, you know,
somebody young.

854
00:32:40,482 --> 00:32:43,102
Who do you think
you like most in the house?

855
00:32:43,103 --> 00:32:44,833
In the house
that I vibe with?

856
00:32:44,827 --> 00:32:46,717
Yeah, that you, like,
really vibe with.

857
00:32:46,724 --> 00:32:48,074
It's crazy,
'cause I really like

858
00:32:48,068 --> 00:32:49,478
- Soyoung's personality a lot.
- Yeah.

859
00:32:49,482 --> 00:32:51,072
I just think
she's really cool.

860
00:32:55,379 --> 00:32:57,279
Who are you
the most attracted to?

861
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:58,585
That would be Pola.

862
00:33:00,724 --> 00:33:02,904
[Stefany] <i>I thought
he was gonna say, "Oh, you."</i>

863
00:33:02,896 --> 00:33:05,206
But no, he actually named
other ladies.

864
00:33:05,206 --> 00:33:07,896
<i>Okay, then why am I
the one here with you?</i>

865
00:33:07,896 --> 00:33:10,236
<i>If he had a connection
with someone else,</i>

866
00:33:10,241 --> 00:33:12,551
he should have gone with them,

867
00:33:12,551 --> 00:33:14,411
and not brought me
on this date.

868
00:33:14,413 --> 00:33:16,173
They seem to be
doing amazing.

869
00:33:16,172 --> 00:33:18,832
Thank you for bringing me
out on this date.

870
00:33:18,827 --> 00:33:21,167
- You did great
on the dance floor, so...
- Thank you, thank you.

871
00:33:21,172 --> 00:33:24,072
- [Charlene] I'm so used to
leading all the time, that--
- You are?

872
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:25,968
- Why?
- Yeah, because
I'm independent.

873
00:33:25,965 --> 00:33:27,475
I have to do
everything for myself.

874
00:33:27,482 --> 00:33:30,072
I don't really,
you know...

875
00:33:30,068 --> 00:33:31,688
Who would I be following?

876
00:33:31,689 --> 00:33:33,549
But no, but in dating, like,

877
00:33:33,551 --> 00:33:35,241
people that
you've dated before,

878
00:33:35,241 --> 00:33:37,861
you usually lead
the conversations, and the...

879
00:33:37,862 --> 00:33:39,482
- [Charlene] Um...
- Or it's mixed?

880
00:33:39,482 --> 00:33:41,722
No. I feel like
if I were to do that,

881
00:33:41,724 --> 00:33:44,314
that I would lose interest.

882
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,240
[Jose] Why?

883
00:33:45,241 --> 00:33:46,211
I don't know. I kind of...

884
00:33:46,206 --> 00:33:47,966
Maybe I'm old-fashioned
in that way...

885
00:33:47,965 --> 00:33:49,855
- Okay.
- ...where, in my life,

886
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:51,522
being single,
and a single mom,

887
00:33:51,517 --> 00:33:52,857
and independent...

888
00:33:52,862 --> 00:33:56,002
- Yeah.
- ...I always had to take care
of things, and business,

889
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,070
so it's like, when you're
always wearing the pants,

890
00:34:00,068 --> 00:34:03,968
- or always having to, like,
take the bull by the horns...
- Yeah.

891
00:34:03,965 --> 00:34:06,235
...I'd like to think
that it's nice

892
00:34:06,241 --> 00:34:09,071
to be able to just, like,
let my hair down, and relax...

893
00:34:09,068 --> 00:34:12,028
- Mmm.
- ...and feel like someone can
just lead the conversation.

894
00:34:13,068 --> 00:34:14,998
I am tired
of being independent

895
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,760
in that sense of like, listen,
it's time for me to be able

896
00:34:17,758 --> 00:34:20,028
to, like, sit back and relax.

897
00:34:20,034 --> 00:34:22,104
<i>I've had to be
the front-runner</i>

898
00:34:22,103 --> 00:34:26,903
for a long time now, so yeah,
I'm ready to let somebody else

899
00:34:26,896 --> 00:34:29,066
take the wheel
for a little while.

900
00:34:29,068 --> 00:34:31,378
Um, I see it
completely differently,

901
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:32,619
in dating, especially.

902
00:34:33,241 --> 00:34:34,901
I see both as equals...

903
00:34:34,896 --> 00:34:37,786
- Right.
- ...so part has
its own liberty, and...

904
00:34:37,793 --> 00:34:39,453
- I mean, I get that.
- You know what I mean?

905
00:34:39,448 --> 00:34:42,028
- And don't drive.
- But a woman needs to feel
a certain way.

906
00:34:42,034 --> 00:34:44,664
If you say to me,
"Would you like to go out?"

907
00:34:44,655 --> 00:34:46,235
that lets me know
you're interested.

908
00:34:46,241 --> 00:34:50,621
- It's not that I would expect
a woman to approach at all.
- Right, right.

909
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:53,210
- It's that if she does...
- Yeah.

910
00:34:53,206 --> 00:34:55,406
...I'll be surprised,
and I would say, like,

911
00:34:55,413 --> 00:34:57,103
-"Okay," like, "That's cool."
- Yeah.

912
00:34:57,103 --> 00:35:01,693
I think Jose was starting
to understand my perspective,

913
00:35:01,689 --> 00:35:03,619
but at the same time,
part of me thinks

914
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,720
that deep down, it's not
that important to him.

915
00:35:05,724 --> 00:35:09,524
Like, I don't think he really
gets where I'm coming from,

916
00:35:09,517 --> 00:35:12,207
and what that means
from a woman.

917
00:35:12,206 --> 00:35:14,206
Romantically, as a woman...

918
00:35:14,206 --> 00:35:16,136
- [Jose] Uh-huh.
- ...I want to feel desired.

919
00:35:16,137 --> 00:35:17,517
[Jose] <i>We had a lot of fun,
but I think</i>

920
00:35:17,517 --> 00:35:20,657
that romantic chemistry
is not quite there.

921
00:35:20,655 --> 00:35:21,965
- <i>Salud?</i>
- [Charlene] All right.

922
00:35:21,965 --> 00:35:23,615
- Before we go, let's <i>salud.</i>
- [Charlene] Yes.

923
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,760
- [Jose] <i>Gracias.</i>
- One for the road.

924
00:35:24,758 --> 00:35:25,658
- [chuckles]
- [Jose] Yes.

925
00:35:36,827 --> 00:35:38,617
Would you have gone,
like, Latin dancing,

926
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:40,310
- or is that not your vibe?
- I would have went.

927
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:41,690
- Hell yeah.
- Yeah? Would you
have had fun?

928
00:35:41,689 --> 00:35:43,339
- I would go. Yeah.
- That's an answer.

929
00:35:43,344 --> 00:35:45,974
- That seems like
a cute date, huh?
- It's fun.

930
00:35:45,965 --> 00:35:48,995
So, I feel like
Stefany's been going on dates,

931
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,620
<i>and like, she's allowed to do
whatever she wants,</i>

932
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:54,520
but then again,
I was kind of bummed,

933
00:35:54,517 --> 00:35:55,967
<i>just because for me,</i>

934
00:35:55,965 --> 00:35:57,475
personally,
I don't really have my eye

935
00:35:57,482 --> 00:35:58,342
on anyone else.

936
00:35:59,206 --> 00:36:00,066
Want some beer, maybe?

937
00:36:01,413 --> 00:36:04,383
- What's happening?
- So, you went on a date
with Harrison.

938
00:36:05,103 --> 00:36:06,593
- Yeah.
- [Charlene chuckles]

939
00:36:06,586 --> 00:36:08,236
[Charlene] What's that mean
for you guys, yeah?

940
00:36:08,241 --> 00:36:11,241
- Kind of wanted
to talk to you about it.
- [Charlene and Pola chuckle]

941
00:36:11,241 --> 00:36:13,721
[Ryan] <i>Gabriel's just doing
a little too much for me.</i>

942
00:36:13,724 --> 00:36:14,904
<i>We didn't come in here</i>

943
00:36:14,896 --> 00:36:17,066
<i>with ties already.
This is new energy.</i>

944
00:36:17,068 --> 00:36:18,928
<i>We're getting to know
new people.</i>

945
00:36:18,931 --> 00:36:20,551
<i>You don't know
what pair fits.</i>

946
00:36:20,551 --> 00:36:22,211
He's a smooth guy, huh?

947
00:36:22,206 --> 00:36:23,406
Oh, my gosh.

948
00:36:23,413 --> 00:36:25,343
[Ryan] <i>I feel like
Gabriel lacks respect,</i>

949
00:36:25,344 --> 00:36:27,864
<i>because every time
it's somebody else's turn</i>

950
00:36:27,862 --> 00:36:29,172
<i>to get to know someone,</i>

951
00:36:29,172 --> 00:36:31,032
<i>it's not your time
to infringe.</i>

952
00:36:31,034 --> 00:36:32,694
[both chuckle]

953
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:34,718
[Ryan] <i>I don't think
he knows what</i>

954
00:36:34,724 --> 00:36:37,004
<i>he wants to do with Stefany,</i>

955
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,070
<i>but I think
Gabriel likes attention,</i>

956
00:36:39,068 --> 00:36:41,718
and I think that
anything without him,

957
00:36:41,724 --> 00:36:43,004
I think he wants to be in it.

958
00:36:43,758 --> 00:36:44,998
[imitates slide whistle]

959
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,900
[chuckles]

960
00:36:45,896 --> 00:36:47,206
[all laughing]

961
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:50,380
[Stefany in Spanish]

962
00:36:55,551 --> 00:36:57,171
- Who, you and I?
- Yeah.

963
00:36:57,172 --> 00:36:58,692
I do like Gabriel a lot,

964
00:36:58,689 --> 00:37:01,589
<i>but I'm a little confused,
at this point.</i>

965
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:03,656
[Gabriel] <i>I do not feel
threatened by Ryan,</i>

966
00:37:03,655 --> 00:37:05,925
because no one really has
a chance in here.

967
00:37:05,931 --> 00:37:06,931
I think it's in the bag.

968
00:37:06,931 --> 00:37:08,621
How do you feel about Gabriel?

969
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,520
More friends.

970
00:37:11,689 --> 00:37:15,139
I think that she's interested
in me, 100%.

971
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,970
- [all exclaiming]
- [all laughing]

972
00:37:30,103 --> 00:37:32,003
The conversations
that I've had

973
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,930
with Stefany so far,

974
00:37:33,931 --> 00:37:35,831
I feel like I've peeled back
some layers with her.

975
00:37:35,827 --> 00:37:37,237
<i>I've gotten to know
her better,</i>

976
00:37:37,241 --> 00:37:39,591
<i>but we haven't even been
on a date yet,</i>

977
00:37:39,586 --> 00:37:41,406
<i>so I think this is
the perfect opportunity,</i>

978
00:37:41,413 --> 00:37:43,243
<i>because it is
extremely important</i>

979
00:37:43,241 --> 00:37:44,451
for me to peel back layers.

980
00:37:44,448 --> 00:37:46,998
With anybody
that I'm involved with,

981
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,140
<i>I like to know
what I'm dealing with</i>

982
00:37:50,137 --> 00:37:51,587
before I get into it.

983
00:37:51,586 --> 00:37:53,476
I would like to know
what I'm signing up for.

984
00:37:53,482 --> 00:37:55,452
You got to read a contract
before you sign it.

985
00:37:57,448 --> 00:37:58,928
- Who, you and I?
- Yeah.

986
00:37:58,931 --> 00:38:00,341
- Okay, so...
- Come.

987
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:01,454
Oops.

988
00:38:01,448 --> 00:38:02,448
[Stefany]

989
00:38:02,448 --> 00:38:04,658
-"Come on," you know.
- [Stefany chuckles]

990
00:38:04,655 --> 00:38:06,205
[Stefany] <i>I do like
Gabriel a lot,</i>

991
00:38:06,206 --> 00:38:08,826
<i>but I'm a little confused,
at this point,</i>

992
00:38:08,827 --> 00:38:12,207
because I jibe with Ryan.
He's a cool dude.

993
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:14,546
Why wouldn't I want to go
snorkeling with him?

994
00:38:14,551 --> 00:38:15,721
[chuckling] Let's go.

995
00:38:15,724 --> 00:38:17,004
Bye!

996
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,410
Ohhh!

997
00:38:19,413 --> 00:38:21,553
[Gabriel] <i>I do not feel
threatened by Ryan,</i>

998
00:38:21,551 --> 00:38:24,861
<i>because me and Stefany
were definitely killing it.</i>

999
00:38:24,862 --> 00:38:26,142
<i>We like each other.</i>

1000
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,617
I definitely think no one
really has a chance in here.

1001
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,760
I think it's in the bag.

1002
00:38:33,758 --> 00:38:37,688
[Stefany] I haven't gone
snorkeling in, like, so long.

1003
00:38:37,689 --> 00:38:39,029
[Ryan] <i>I'm excited
to go snorkeling,</i>

1004
00:38:39,034 --> 00:38:40,484
<i>because
the water's magnificent.</i>

1005
00:38:40,482 --> 00:38:41,832
<i>Like, the water's
beautiful here,</i>

1006
00:38:41,827 --> 00:38:43,827
<i>and it's even more exciting
to do it with a person</i>

1007
00:38:43,827 --> 00:38:45,927
<i>that you're interested in,
that's looking good.</i>

1008
00:38:49,172 --> 00:38:50,002
No.

1009
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,340
[Stefany] <i>Ryan's definitely
looking out.</i>

1010
00:38:53,344 --> 00:38:55,414
<i>He's teaching me
how to snorkel.</i>

1011
00:38:55,413 --> 00:38:58,723
<i>I'm following his lead.
He makes me feel comfortable.</i>

1012
00:38:58,724 --> 00:39:00,344
Just going with the flow.

1013
00:39:00,344 --> 00:39:02,594
<i>So, he goes in for the kiss,</i>

1014
00:39:02,586 --> 00:39:04,896
and it was just so sweet.

1015
00:39:07,241 --> 00:39:08,101
[chuckles]

1016
00:39:08,965 --> 00:39:09,965
[kisses]

1017
00:39:10,965 --> 00:39:11,855
[Stefany] This is so...

1018
00:39:11,862 --> 00:39:13,452
[Ryan] <i>Stefany's
a pretty good kisser.</i>

1019
00:39:13,448 --> 00:39:14,928
<i>It's not an awkward kiss.</i>

1020
00:39:14,931 --> 00:39:16,411
<i>This kiss is meant to happen.</i>

1021
00:39:16,413 --> 00:39:20,413
These lips and these lips work
when they come together.

1022
00:39:21,482 --> 00:39:24,032
Here's to great friendships,
and good times.

1023
00:39:24,034 --> 00:39:25,384
Good times.

1024
00:39:25,379 --> 00:39:26,239
[Stefany] Cheers.

1025
00:39:29,758 --> 00:39:31,478
So, are you enjoying yourself?

1026
00:39:31,896 --> 00:39:32,756
[Ryan] I am.

1027
00:39:32,758 --> 00:39:33,828
Like, I feel like
the first couple

1028
00:39:33,827 --> 00:39:36,237
of conversations we had
were like, very open.

1029
00:39:36,241 --> 00:39:39,211
I appreciate in general
how your conversation is,

1030
00:39:39,206 --> 00:39:40,236
and then, how

1031
00:39:41,793 --> 00:39:43,213
genuine you are.

1032
00:39:43,206 --> 00:39:44,756
Thanks for acknowledging that.

1033
00:39:46,241 --> 00:39:47,861
How do you feel
about the moms?

1034
00:39:47,862 --> 00:39:49,382
Well, you know,
there's a couple people

1035
00:39:49,379 --> 00:39:50,549
that I've had my eye on.

1036
00:39:50,551 --> 00:39:51,691
I was open with you.

1037
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:52,929
You were one of those people.

1038
00:39:53,448 --> 00:39:54,718
I just felt like

1039
00:39:55,896 --> 00:39:59,446
it was a lot to

1040
00:39:59,448 --> 00:40:01,548
get some time with you,

1041
00:40:01,551 --> 00:40:03,211
- you know, like,
just because...
- Oh, because I was always

1042
00:40:03,931 --> 00:40:05,031
with Gabriel, you mean?

1043
00:40:05,034 --> 00:40:07,524
I mean, yeah, like,
how do feel about Gabriel now?

1044
00:40:07,517 --> 00:40:08,587
Honestly?

1045
00:40:08,586 --> 00:40:09,716
He's funny,

1046
00:40:10,724 --> 00:40:12,214
but I think...
I don't know.

1047
00:40:13,241 --> 00:40:16,381
We've hung out,
we've gone out on a date,

1048
00:40:16,379 --> 00:40:19,449
but it's just been fun,
like, more friends, I think.

1049
00:40:21,655 --> 00:40:23,445
I haven't...
I mean, he didn't...

1050
00:40:23,448 --> 00:40:25,548
He hasn't tried
to kiss me, or anything.

1051
00:40:25,551 --> 00:40:28,211
<i>I think because Gabriel
makes me feel comfortable,</i>

1052
00:40:28,206 --> 00:40:32,716
maybe it comes off that I'm
only, you know, open to him.

1053
00:40:32,724 --> 00:40:36,284
I think I like you the most,
because you're older.

1054
00:40:36,275 --> 00:40:37,855
- The older son.
- Right.

1055
00:40:37,862 --> 00:40:38,862
Yeah.

1056
00:40:38,862 --> 00:40:41,902
I feel like the other sons
are more like

1057
00:40:41,896 --> 00:40:43,686
-"friends" friends, I think.
- Mmm-hmm.

1058
00:40:43,689 --> 00:40:45,719
If that's the case, then...

1059
00:40:45,724 --> 00:40:47,284
- [Stefany] Mmm-hmm.
- ...based on this date
and wherever it goes,

1060
00:40:47,275 --> 00:40:49,445
- since I'm the first person
you kissed in the house...
- [Stefany] I know.

1061
00:40:49,448 --> 00:40:50,928
...rough question for you.

1062
00:40:52,931 --> 00:40:53,791
[sighs]

1063
00:40:53,793 --> 00:40:55,243
What do you think?

1064
00:40:55,241 --> 00:40:56,761
You know, I like
hanging out with you,

1065
00:40:56,758 --> 00:40:58,278
and I think
we've had a connection,

1066
00:40:58,275 --> 00:41:00,025
but we haven't had
enough time to spend

1067
00:41:00,034 --> 00:41:01,764
- time together.
- Yeah.

1068
00:41:01,758 --> 00:41:03,378
This was fun.

1069
00:41:03,379 --> 00:41:04,969
[Ryan] <i>Based on
what Stefany tells me,</i>

1070
00:41:04,965 --> 00:41:06,855
<i>I think that
she's interested in me,</i>

1071
00:41:07,482 --> 00:41:09,142
100%.

1072
00:41:09,137 --> 00:41:11,687
Now look, I'm gonna be
down for you,

1073
00:41:11,689 --> 00:41:13,969
but you gotta make time.
You know what I'm saying?

1074
00:41:13,965 --> 00:41:15,655
There's plenty more dates
where this came from,

1075
00:41:15,655 --> 00:41:17,205
in my eyes, with you.

1076
00:41:17,862 --> 00:41:19,832
Cheers to more dates, Ryan.

1077
00:41:19,827 --> 00:41:22,307
Cheers to more dates
with you, Stefany.

1078
00:41:25,206 --> 00:41:29,966
<i>♪ I know all about it
You're my Cadillac love ♪</i>

1079
00:41:29,965 --> 00:41:31,305
[Ryan] <i>Gabriel thinks</i>

1080
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:33,140
<i>he's sealed the deal
with Stefany,</i>

1081
00:41:33,137 --> 00:41:36,517
but in my eyes, I mean,
I'm obviously the choice.

1082
00:41:38,517 --> 00:41:39,477
That's the bottom line.

1083
00:41:51,482 --> 00:41:52,832
[laughs]

1084
00:41:52,827 --> 00:41:53,787
- Are you comfy,
or are you falling?
- You're gonna... I'm...

1085
00:41:53,793 --> 00:41:54,693
- I'm perfect.
- Put your legs.

1086
00:41:54,689 --> 00:41:56,309
[Stefany] I am perfect!

1087
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:57,760
You want to sit here, too?

1088
00:41:57,758 --> 00:41:59,998
Stefany, offer him a spot,
I'm out.

1089
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,450
I know Gabriel feels
threatened by me,

1090
00:42:02,448 --> 00:42:04,448
and I would feel
threatened by me, too.

1091
00:42:05,827 --> 00:42:07,547
[Kelle] <i>Billy and I
are turning up the heat.</i>

1092
00:42:07,551 --> 00:42:08,901
Sorry, Mom.

1093
00:42:11,137 --> 00:42:14,687
I just don't like the fact
that Kelle's, like

1094
00:42:14,689 --> 00:42:17,929
six feet away from me,
in your bed.

1095
00:42:17,931 --> 00:42:18,861
I think you're being
a little bit

1096
00:42:18,862 --> 00:42:20,452
too overprotective.

1097
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:24,170
And now, for the bad news.

1098
00:42:24,172 --> 00:42:25,172
- Ooh!
- Oh!

1099
00:42:25,172 --> 00:42:27,412
There is one mother
and one son going home.

1100
00:42:27,413 --> 00:42:28,383
- [gasps]
- [April J] Oh, no!

1101
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,279
- [Pola] What the...
- [Shannan] No.

1102
00:42:29,275 --> 00:42:30,755
- [Pola] What?
- [Stefany] No.

1103
00:42:30,758 --> 00:42:33,688
- [Gabriel] Are you serious?
- I didn't think
anybody was going home.

1104
00:42:33,689 --> 00:42:35,519
- It's not a joke.
- Hey, show me
that thing it's in.

1105
00:42:35,517 --> 00:42:36,827
It just got real.

1106
00:42:36,827 --> 00:42:38,167
It's just shocking.

1107
00:42:38,172 --> 00:42:39,282
[Billy] It's serious, people.
