Sakura remembers her training with Tsunade when she was taught to observe enemies' weaknesses and dodge their attacks. Sasori attacks with an Iron Sand pyramid and prism, but Sakura is able to fend them off, causing a cave in. Sasori then uses a new technique to attack with randomly-growing iron spikes, landing a hit imbued with a poison that quickly paralyzes its victims. With a final attack of the Third Kazekage's puppet, Sasori attempts to kill the seemingly helpless Sakura, only to discover at the last second that it was a ruse. Somehow immune to the effects of the poison, Sakura destroys his puppet with a single punch at the last second.\u2014Anonymous"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "1214533", "rating": 7.9, "votes": 887, "number_of_episodes": 501}
