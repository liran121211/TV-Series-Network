[music]

8
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:54,742
- Captain.

00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:09,156
[sigh]

00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,395
[stammers]

11
00:03:16,964 --> 00:03:17,998
- I know.

12
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:22,703
I know.

13
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:28,141
[sobbing]

14
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,212
Elsa: My father won't
speak of the war.

15
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:09,850
When men ask if he fought,
he says no.

16
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:14,588
I've seen fellow soldiers call
out his name on the street.

17
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:17,825
He turns and walks
the other way.

18
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:24,965
He spent three years
in a Union prison.

19
00:04:25,032 --> 00:04:27,735
When he came home,
my mother said

20
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:29,737
he weighed ninety-seven pounds.

21
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:33,774
[music]

22
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:04,798
[music]

23
00:06:48,476 --> 00:06:50,143
- Gonna need a cook.

24
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,211
Or two.

25
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:52,780
- Why do we need a cook?

26
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:55,048
- Because your passengers are
feasting like it's Christmas

27
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:56,584
and somebody needs
to ration their food

28
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:59,286
because when they run out,
they're coming after my food.

29
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:00,854
Or your food...

30
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,691
- We're gonna bring
a herd of beef with us.

31
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,258
Food ain't gonna be a problem.

32
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:07,427
- Yeah, it will.

33
00:07:07,495 --> 00:07:09,162
Add a cook to the list.

34
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:13,166
You feel like moving some cows?

35
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:16,637
- Somebody's gotta watch
after these folks.

36
00:07:16,704 --> 00:07:20,173
- If these folks can't survive
six hours sitting by a river,

37
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,575
I'd rather know it now.

38
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,177
[sigh]

39
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,084
- What are you looking at?

40
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:32,720
- Nuthin'.

41
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,828
- How come I ain't got no hair?

42
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:44,798
- "Ain't got no"?

43
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:48,001
Been in Texas six days,
you already forgot how to speak.

44
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:49,570
- How come?

45
00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:51,238
- You will.

46
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,643
When you're older.

47
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:58,245
- But how come not now?

48
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,581
- I don't know
"how come not now."

49
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:03,851
Maybe 'cause it makes
you easier to tickle.

50
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:05,786
[laughing]

51
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:08,488
James: Elsa.

52
00:08:13,794 --> 00:08:15,395
Where's your mother?

53
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:18,398
- Don't know.

54
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:20,167
- We're going to go
round up some cattle.

55
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,201
Be back in the afternoon.

56
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:22,435
I want you to stay in camp,

57
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,871
I want you to keep
an eye on your brother,

58
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:25,873
and don't wander off.

59
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:28,475
All right.

60
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:33,681
[music]

61
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:11,484
- Cool air rises from the ground
and sends a shiver through me.

62
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:15,088
Then the sun finds my face,
and I am warm.

63
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,526
The world here plays parlor
tricks on your senses...

64
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:25,065
I do not know what
the word "Texas" means.

65
00:09:25,132 --> 00:09:26,433
But to me it means magic.

66
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,242
- Look, these here cattle,

67
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:36,509
they're going to Kansas

68
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,345
unless you can
pay Kansas prices.

69
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,147
- What are Kansas prices?

70
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:41,615
- Hell, you can get
forty dollars a head

71
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:42,950
for these sons
of bitches up there.

72
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:45,285
Those New Yorkers
sure do love their steaks.

73
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:46,854
- We can't pay that.

74
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:51,224
- Well, I don't blame you.
I wouldn't either.

75
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,727
I tell you what,
I'll put a bee in your bonnet.

76
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:56,029
There's still wild cattle
down there on the Brazos,

77
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,098
if you got the stones
to go get 'em.

78
00:09:58,165 --> 00:10:01,268
- We got the stones,
we just don't have the men.

79
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:04,071
- We could saddle up some
of them wagon horses,

80
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:05,839
stick them Germans on them.

81
00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:07,708
Surely they can hold a line.

82
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:10,243
- Don't bet on it.

83
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:13,546
[horse neighs]

84
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,448
- Let's put them in the sell
barn, lot four.

85
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:27,728
Ain't changed
our mind yet, Captain.

86
00:10:27,795 --> 00:10:30,397
- We're going to round some up.
Can I hire you for that?

87
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,765
- Where you holding 'em?

88
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:34,234
- Ain't found them to hold them.
- Hm.

89
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:35,803
You hunting wild cattle?

90
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:39,139
- I'll give you a dollar apiece
for every one you gather.

91
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:40,774
- How many you trying
to get together?

92
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:42,275
- Hundred or so.

93
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:44,111
- You need ten hands.

94
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:45,746
And I mean good hands.

95
00:10:45,813 --> 00:10:49,016
- How 'bout three good hands and
twenty who ain't worth a shit.

96
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:50,650
- If they ain't worth a shit

97
00:10:50,718 --> 00:10:52,720
we ain't gonna get nuthin'
and we ain't gonna get paid.

98
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:54,187
- I'll pay you
ten dollars apiece

99
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:55,823
whether we wrangle any or not.

100
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,162
- You're wasting your money.

101
00:11:02,229 --> 00:11:03,697
- Aw, come on, Wade.

102
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:05,498
You're handy enough
for all of us.

103
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:09,970
- Yeah, there's still some wild
cattle around Fort Griffith.

104
00:11:10,037 --> 00:11:11,872
That's a pretty
good ride though.

105
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:14,742
- We're ready when you are.

106
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:17,144
- Yee-haw. [clicks tongue]
- Yee-haw.

107
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,279
- Come on, boys, y'all
got cattle to sort, let's go.

108
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,081
- We'll be back for them
cattle, don't you worry.

109
00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:22,315
Hya!
[clicks tongue]

110
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:29,990
[music]

111
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:35,362
- It seems even trees
are new to this place.

112
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:38,665
They scatter about in clusters,
like little villages...

113
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,837
And everywhere, treasures.

114
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:46,673
Everywhere there
is a bounty

115
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,475
just waiting
to be scooped up...

116
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,444
[gasps]

117
00:12:30,017 --> 00:12:33,120
When I looked
out over this land,

118
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:35,856
I only saw the freedom
it promised.

119
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:41,294
I knew nothing of the horror
that hides in freedom's shadow.

120
00:12:43,864 --> 00:12:45,032
[gasps]

121
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,538
[groaning, vomiting]

122
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,450
[sighs]

123
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:12,159
- Let me see 'em

124
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:18,966
[sigh]

125
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:20,267
Put them in the pot.

126
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:28,141
[sighs]
Fools.

127
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:36,449
- I'm going to go warn him
- Don't bother.

128
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:38,351
Better they die up here

129
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:40,587
than do something on
the trail that gets us killed.

130
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,456
Only cure for stupid is
reaching the gates of heaven.

131
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:47,394
- Funny, I don't recall the word
"stupid" anywhere in the Bible.

132
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:52,665
[panting]

133
00:13:52,732 --> 00:13:54,701
- Look what
the cat drug to camp.

134
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:59,106
- Across the river...
People...

135
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,041
Nausea has a number
of them to their knees.

136
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:05,012
- You were across the river?

137
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:08,248
Your dress is dry,
so you didn't swim.

138
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:11,418
Either you learned how to fly

139
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:13,186
or you rode the back
of one of those Germans.

140
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:16,589
I don't know which image
is more upsetting.

141
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:18,591
- There's a sand bar.

142
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:20,393
And a log.

143
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,029
- Mystery solved then.

144
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,070
They don't even boil it.

145
00:14:30,137 --> 00:14:32,372
Just drink it like
it's from a faucet.

146
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:34,607
Cholera will run
the lot of them.

147
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:36,977
- What's my mother doing?

148
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:43,316
- She's wasting her time.

149
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:44,985
- I'm done with berries.

150
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:46,653
Your turn.

151
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,355
Mind the thorns.

152
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:53,893
[music]

153
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:01,401
- Don't see any saddle horses.

154
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:04,704
- I've got a few.

155
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:06,439
- Got a few saddles, too?

156
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:09,542
These sons of bitches
are plow drivers.

157
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:11,178
- We warned you.

158
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:14,347
- Hell, we're better
off without 'em.

159
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,049
- Can any of 'em ride?

160
00:15:16,116 --> 00:15:18,251
- I got one can ride.

161
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,720
[clicks tongue]

162
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,728
[crying]

163
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:37,270
- It's the water.

164
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:39,739
You have to boil it
before you drink it.

165
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:41,574
[speaks German]

166
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:43,210
Don't drink it.

167
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,544
[groans]

168
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:55,888
[cries]

169
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:02,495
- Go saddle Lightning.

170
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:05,498
- She's sick.
From the water.

171
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:06,699
They all are.

172
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:09,969
- Go saddle Lightning.

173
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:14,541
[groaning]

174
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:31,591
You making them tea?

175
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,860
- These poor people
don't know to boil water.

176
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:36,329
- I'll be gone
'till tomorrow late.

177
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:38,431
- Be careful.

178
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,567
- Shotgun's under the
buckboard if there's trouble.

179
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:42,569
- [laughs] I have Claire
if there's trouble.

180
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:45,004
- Claire usually
makes things worse.

181
00:16:45,072 --> 00:16:46,939
I'm taking Elsa...

182
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,441
- You're what?

183
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,243
- This bunch is short
on riders and we need her.

184
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:56,216
- I'd object, but it sounds like
you're not asking my permission.

185
00:16:56,283 --> 00:16:58,151
- No, ma'am, I am not.

186
00:16:58,218 --> 00:16:59,819
- How am I supposed
to make her a lady

187
00:16:59,886 --> 00:17:02,389
when you keep treating her
like a man?

188
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:03,856
- Plenty of ladies
in this world.

189
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:06,059
Pretty short
on decent men, though.

190
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:07,327
[clicks tongue]

191
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:09,596
- How am I supposed
to respond to that?

192
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,242
- Sun'll be fierce.

193
00:17:27,013 --> 00:17:29,682
- [laughs]
It'll blow off.

194
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:33,753
- Here, tie it down.

195
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:43,630
- What's that for?

196
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:45,132
- Not sure.

197
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:47,867
But I'd sure hate you don't
have it when we find out.

198
00:17:49,136 --> 00:17:50,503
Stay close to me.

199
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:53,606
[chuckles]

200
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:58,911
[music]

201
00:18:46,226 --> 00:18:48,027
- They're back early.

202
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:49,396
- Yep.

203
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:50,797
Shea: Who are they?

204
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:54,267
- A stroke of luck
there, Captain.

205
00:18:58,338 --> 00:18:59,606
[clicks tongue]

206
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,359
- Goddamn, Wade.

207
00:19:19,426 --> 00:19:22,028
If there's a better way
to get shot I don't know it,

208
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:25,232
chargin' in here like a
bunch of fucking bandits.

209
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:26,833
[chuckles]

210
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:29,569
- We've seen you shoot, Grady.
I think the bandits are safe.

211
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:31,137
- Y'all hunting strays?

212
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:33,606
- Wild ones. Seen any?

213
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,107
- Yeah, some.

214
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,044
Them wild bulls pester them
English cows pretty good.

215
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,580
Must be the way they smell.

216
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:43,650
All smell the same to me,
but I ain't a bull.

217
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:45,952
- Your crew's pretty light
to gather wild cattle.

218
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,821
- Could use the help.
We'll pay.

219
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:51,624
- No need.
We need to clear some out.

220
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,560
Y'all best come on up to camp.

221
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,765
- Come on.

222
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:02,402
[music]

223
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,073
- Good to see you, Wade.

224
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,276
Almost fucking shot you.
- [laughing]

225
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:20,052
- Whoo, yeah,
I got you one.

226
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:22,221
- What you got here?

227
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:23,756
- I bet you double.

228
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:25,325
- Woo.

229
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:28,295
- I'm surprised you got anything
to bet at all after Abilene.

230
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:31,230
That town is hard
on a cowboy's wallet.

231
00:20:31,298 --> 00:20:33,900
- We stay away from
that son of a bitch.

232
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:36,469
It'll suck on you like a tick.

233
00:20:36,536 --> 00:20:38,805
- You better bat your eyes...

234
00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:44,076
- Even if we get a herd
to the wagons, we can't hold it.

235
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:48,047
We can't leave till we've hired
some guns and some hands.

236
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:51,318
- These Germans gotta learn
to hold their own, Thomas.

237
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,121
Or they won't survive the trip.

238
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:56,523
None of us will.

239
00:20:58,391 --> 00:21:00,893
- They're barely
surviving the river

240
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,130
and they ain't camped
five miles from town.

241
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:05,732
- There ain't no one to hire.

242
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:10,169
- Then we don't go.

243
00:21:10,236 --> 00:21:12,772
- You can stay.
I'm going.

244
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:16,776
I want to see it one last time.

245
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:19,912
Before it's settled.

246
00:21:22,915 --> 00:21:24,116
Before it's ruined.

247
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:29,055
- After you see it, then what?

248
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:32,325
- Then I don't care.

249
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:35,695
The world can
open up and eat me.

250
00:21:35,762 --> 00:21:36,963
I don't give a shit.

251
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,932
[sniffs]

252
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,915
- What's that for?

253
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:57,283
- Well, it's for snakes.

254
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:00,720
They won't cross it.

255
00:22:00,787 --> 00:22:02,789
- What about you?

256
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:04,223
- Honey, I'm so far away
from a bath

257
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:06,493
ain't no snake gonna
curl up next to me.

258
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:11,798
Ah...

259
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:13,633
[Elsa laughs]

260
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:19,238
[clears throat]

261
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:21,408
- Mm.

262
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:25,445
[sighs]

263
00:22:26,446 --> 00:22:27,547
- Thank you.

264
00:22:28,815 --> 00:22:29,816
For bringing me.

265
00:22:30,717 --> 00:22:33,553
- Hm. Bringing you ain't a gift.

266
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:36,856
We need you.

267
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,325
So, thank you.

268
00:22:40,627 --> 00:22:43,129
These cattle are wild.

269
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,998
These bulls will hook you.

270
00:22:46,065 --> 00:22:49,502
Don't get caught up
in the brush with one.

271
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:51,471
You push the ones
that want to be pushed,

272
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:53,372
the rest we leave behind.

273
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,275
I need you to hear
me on that.

274
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,511
- Yes.

275
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,181
- I trust you.

276
00:23:15,862 --> 00:23:17,296
- Know what today is?

277
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:21,701
- [laughs]
I don't know.

278
00:23:25,171 --> 00:23:26,506
Thursday, maybe?

279
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:35,147
- Eighteen years-ago
on this day,

280
00:23:35,214 --> 00:23:39,719
Lee surrendered to Grant
in the home of Wilmer Mclean

281
00:23:39,786 --> 00:23:43,756
in the village of Appomattox.

282
00:23:43,823 --> 00:23:47,794
A year later, I was born.

283
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:52,364
It was Monday,
April 9th, 1883,

284
00:23:54,467 --> 00:23:55,768
Monday was my birthday.

285
00:23:56,836 --> 00:23:59,839
- Yeah, Thursday.

286
00:24:03,976 --> 00:24:05,144
I think you're right.

287
00:24:19,025 --> 00:24:21,293
- Hey. Wake up.

288
00:24:23,696 --> 00:24:24,697
We gotta go.

289
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,939
He's already saddled.

290
00:24:46,052 --> 00:24:47,353
I'll follow you.

291
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:48,855
- I can't see.

292
00:24:48,921 --> 00:24:50,857
- Follow the horse
in front of you

293
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:53,960
and watch its hooves
sparking off the rocks.

294
00:24:54,894 --> 00:24:58,364
[music]

295
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:27,326
- We'll ride out
in a line from here.

296
00:25:27,393 --> 00:25:29,195
I'll drop you off as we go.

297
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:31,063
When I'm set, I'll call out.

298
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:33,232
The next man in line
does the same.

299
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:34,934
Drive due west.

300
00:25:35,001 --> 00:25:37,837
When you hit the river don't
cross if you don't see tracks.

301
00:25:37,904 --> 00:25:40,472
It's boggy enough to swallow
horse and rider both.

302
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:41,941
When you hit the meadow,

303
00:25:42,008 --> 00:25:44,510
wait for the men in
the south to fold north.

304
00:25:44,577 --> 00:25:47,346
Hold your line and we'll
push 'em right into camp.

305
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:51,718
Stay here.
This is your hole.

306
00:25:51,784 --> 00:25:53,586
The rest follow me.

307
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:02,929
- What do I do?
- You follow 'em.

308
00:26:05,131 --> 00:26:07,066
[music]

309
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,917
- In the back, hold...

310
00:26:38,665 --> 00:26:40,900
[horse snorting]

311
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,938

312
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:55,414

313
00:27:07,694 --> 00:27:09,829
[shouting]

314
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,098
[shouts]

315
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:16,168
- Come on, buddy.

316
00:28:15,561 --> 00:28:16,863
[snorts]

317
00:28:19,899 --> 00:28:21,467
[kisses]

318
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:28,640
- Hey.

319
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:31,243
Ha. Ha!

320
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:34,446
[music]

321
00:28:55,134 --> 00:28:56,302

[cow lows]

323
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:05,812
[whooping]

324
00:29:07,013 --> 00:29:09,315
- Push 'em up,
push 'em up!

325
00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:10,850
- Come on!

326
00:29:12,151 --> 00:29:13,352
Get!

327
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:15,354
[whoops]
- Keep 'em comin'.

328
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:17,790
- Whoa!
- Come on, cow!

329
00:29:17,857 --> 00:29:19,959
- Come on.

330
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,729
[cow lows]

331
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:30,236
- They're coming out of
the south with a few more.

332
00:29:30,302 --> 00:29:32,504
We'll marry them here,
then push em on.

333
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:37,143
Makes you wonder what
the rich folk are doing, huh?

334
00:29:39,211 --> 00:29:41,680
- They ain't doing this.

335
00:29:41,747 --> 00:29:43,883
- No, ma'am, they ain't.
- [laughs]

336
00:29:51,323 --> 00:29:54,827
- I looked to my right
and saw my father,

337
00:29:54,894 --> 00:29:57,529
somehow riding vertically
toward the earth.

338
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:06,538
Beyond him, cowboys
and cattle pushed toward us,

339
00:30:06,605 --> 00:30:09,608
dust following them
like a cloudy shadow.

340
00:30:10,877 --> 00:30:14,914
The light was soft
and pale and pink,

341
00:30:14,981 --> 00:30:19,751
like God decided to
light this day with candles.

342
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:23,255
And the whole of Texas
spread out before me.

343
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:27,426
It was the most magnificent
thing I'd ever seen.

344
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:28,861
- Well, that went better
than I expected.

345
00:30:28,928 --> 00:30:30,229
- [chuckles]

346
00:30:31,931 --> 00:30:33,832
- You having fun?
- Yeah.

347
00:30:38,737 --> 00:30:40,639
- We got to get someone
at the mouth of that draw,

348
00:30:40,706 --> 00:30:42,674
so they don't leak into it.

349
00:30:42,741 --> 00:30:44,877
Someone else
to push from the rear.

350
00:30:44,944 --> 00:30:47,179
- I'll do it.

351
00:30:47,246 --> 00:30:48,580
Can I do it?

352
00:30:48,647 --> 00:30:50,649
- You can do it.
- [chuckles]

353
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:51,984

[music]

355
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,094
- All right, boys.
Let's get a moving.

356
00:31:02,161 --> 00:31:04,330
Yip!

357
00:31:04,396 --> 00:31:05,497
- Freedom...

358
00:31:06,966 --> 00:31:08,600
To most, it is an idea.

359
00:31:10,169 --> 00:31:12,538
An abstract thought that
pertains to control.

360
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:16,175
That's not freedom.

361
00:31:16,242 --> 00:31:19,145
That's independence.

362
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:24,250
Freedom is riding wild
over untamed land

363
00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:27,053
with no notion
any moment exists

364
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:29,355
beyond the one you are living.

365
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,832
[playing music]

366
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:56,148
- They gonna play
music all night?

367
00:31:56,215 --> 00:31:58,117
- It looks that way.

368
00:31:58,184 --> 00:31:59,986
- When do they sleep?

369
00:32:00,052 --> 00:32:03,289
- That is a question
yet to be answered.

370
00:32:03,355 --> 00:32:05,624
But I know when you sleep:
you sleep now.

371
00:32:05,691 --> 00:32:10,096
- Yes, ma'am.
[woman singing]

372
00:32:10,162 --> 00:32:13,399
- Godless noise.

373
00:32:13,465 --> 00:32:15,501
We could be listening
to cicadas and frogs

374
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:17,836
by the river, but instead
we're listening to this.

375
00:32:17,903 --> 00:32:19,371
- For once, we're in agreement.

376
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,874
But I don't mind the song.

377
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,210
I mean, it's sad...

378
00:32:26,078 --> 00:32:28,580
But I suppose I'd be sad too

379
00:32:28,647 --> 00:32:30,682
if I was a world away
from my home.

380
00:32:30,749 --> 00:32:32,818
- You are a world
away from your home.

381
00:32:37,756 --> 00:32:40,326
I don't know what he expects
to find in these mountains,

382
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:41,960
or wherever it is
we're headed,

383
00:32:42,028 --> 00:32:43,529
but I'll tell you
what we won't find:

384
00:32:43,595 --> 00:32:45,864
we won't find civilization.

385
00:32:45,931 --> 00:32:48,367
We won't find
a church for prayer

386
00:32:48,434 --> 00:32:51,837
or a house with wood floors
or painted walls,

387
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:57,676
restaurants or friends
or schools for our children.

388
00:32:57,743 --> 00:32:59,545
We just left it all behind.

389
00:33:01,447 --> 00:33:04,016
- I don't recall anyone forcing
you on the train, Claire.

390
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,491
- Fate forced me.

391
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:15,561
When it robbed me of a husband

392
00:33:15,627 --> 00:33:18,330
and robbed my child
of a future with him.

393
00:33:18,397 --> 00:33:21,833
What was I to do,
beg on the street?

394
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,070
Don't recall anyone
forcing me...

395
00:33:27,873 --> 00:33:29,941
Who the hell do you
think you are?

396
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,179
- I...

397
00:33:34,913 --> 00:33:36,348
- What is so funny?

398
00:33:36,415 --> 00:33:37,949
- Honestly, Claire...

399
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,918
I don't have the energy
or the interest

400
00:33:39,985 --> 00:33:42,721
to continue this conversation.

401
00:33:42,788 --> 00:33:43,789
- Well.

402
00:33:44,823 --> 00:33:46,125
[scoffs]

403
00:33:48,127 --> 00:33:49,895
He's a dreamer, Margaret.

404
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:52,164
Always has been.

405
00:33:52,231 --> 00:33:53,799
And they never come true.

406
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,102
- It's coming true, Claire.

407
00:33:56,168 --> 00:33:57,269
- No.

408
00:33:58,537 --> 00:33:59,838
This is not the dream.

409
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:04,376
This is the nightmare.

410
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:10,716
You'll see.

411
00:34:12,184 --> 00:34:15,554
[music]

412
00:34:35,607 --> 00:34:37,876
- You drink coffee?

413
00:34:37,943 --> 00:34:39,411
- It's not for me.

414
00:34:39,478 --> 00:34:40,646
- No one else here.

415
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:46,752
You lied!

416
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:48,320
- I did, didn't I?

417
00:34:48,387 --> 00:34:49,955
- What kind of a woman
drinks coffee?

418
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:53,292
- I can't wait to hear
this lecture on womanhood.

419
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:54,926
This coffee is for him.

420
00:34:54,993 --> 00:34:56,295
After a long night.

421
00:34:56,362 --> 00:34:59,598
Someday, if you're lucky
to find a man

422
00:34:59,665 --> 00:35:03,202
or simply find a man
who is extremely unlucky,

423
00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:08,340
you will learn coffee is a
welcome treat after a hard ride.

424
00:35:13,312 --> 00:35:14,846
Mmm.

425
00:35:23,289 --> 00:35:25,191
[hooves approaching]

426
00:35:25,257 --> 00:35:27,526
- Take it easy,
just a little bit.

427
00:35:31,597 --> 00:35:33,532
- Where's the wagon boss?

428
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,066
- He camps to the south.

429
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:41,973
- [laughs]
Fucking gypsies.

430
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,942
Gypsies don't travel
with much, I've learned.

431
00:35:44,009 --> 00:35:45,644
But you, uh...

432
00:35:45,711 --> 00:35:50,216
You Irish, y'all usually
travel well stocked.

433
00:35:50,282 --> 00:35:53,985
I'll ask again,
where's your wagon boss?

434
00:35:54,052 --> 00:35:56,888
- You'll be meeting
him soon enough.

435
00:35:56,955 --> 00:35:58,257
- Mm-hmm.

436
00:35:58,324 --> 00:36:01,159
- We have nothing
to offer you, sir. Be gone!

437
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:05,797
- Be gone, she says.

438
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,602
- What do you want here?

439
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:13,572
- Last I checked,
ain't nobody owned the river.

440
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:16,508
Be gone.

441
00:36:26,218 --> 00:36:27,786
Hell.

442
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:31,823
[panting]

443
00:36:36,262 --> 00:36:37,996
- God dammit.

444
00:36:38,063 --> 00:36:41,900
- Go!
You're not welcome here! Go!

445
00:36:42,968 --> 00:36:44,035
Go!

446
00:36:46,438 --> 00:36:48,240
[gasps]

447
00:36:48,307 --> 00:36:51,610
- You are the devil! I see you!
I see you!

448
00:36:51,677 --> 00:36:52,978
I see you!

[screaming]

450
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:04,356
- And to think, all I wanted
to do was water the horses.

451
00:37:04,423 --> 00:37:07,192
Ain't all I want to do now.

452
00:37:07,259 --> 00:37:08,327
[shotgun cocks]

453
00:37:08,394 --> 00:37:10,662
- It'll be the
last thing you do.

454
00:37:11,997 --> 00:37:14,266
- There's a dozen guns
with sixty bullets

455
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:15,701
between 'em out here.

456
00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:18,570
You've only got two.
- And they're both for you.

458
00:37:24,676 --> 00:37:26,912

John?

John! John!

00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:24,002
- Mama?
- John!

00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:26,271
Oh my God, oh my God!

- Hey. That's a girl.

476
00:39:20,626 --> 00:39:22,928
- Yep.
Dress sort of gave it away.

477
00:39:22,994 --> 00:39:24,563
- Pretty handy.

478
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:27,399
- She got around good.

479
00:39:27,466 --> 00:39:29,468
- Not awful to look at either.

480
00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:32,504
- Hard to tell with
that hat hanging over her head

481
00:39:32,571 --> 00:39:34,072
like elephant ears.

482
00:39:35,574 --> 00:39:38,977
- Hey.
[clicks tongue]

483
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:40,579
[whistling]
- Come on.

484
00:39:40,646 --> 00:39:42,681
- Hey.

485
00:39:42,748 --> 00:39:43,915
Thirsty?

486
00:39:48,587 --> 00:39:50,789
There you go.
Careful.

487
00:39:50,856 --> 00:39:52,390
Would you take off your hat?

488
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,893
Wanna get a better look at you.

489
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:57,362
- Why get a better look?

490
00:39:57,429 --> 00:39:59,297
- Well.

491
00:39:59,364 --> 00:40:01,366
There's a fair chance
you're too pretty for me.

492
00:40:01,433 --> 00:40:04,369
If you are, I'd rather know
now so I don't waste my time.

493
00:40:05,771 --> 00:40:07,405
- Maybe you're
too pretty for me.

494
00:40:07,473 --> 00:40:09,775
[laughs]

495
00:40:09,841 --> 00:40:11,810
- Well, shoot.

496
00:40:11,877 --> 00:40:13,679
I mean, if me being pretty
is the problem,

497
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:16,147
then we ain't got a problem.

498
00:40:17,616 --> 00:40:19,184
Shoot.

499
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:34,399
Yep.

500
00:40:34,466 --> 00:40:35,701
Too pretty for me.

501
00:40:37,135 --> 00:40:38,069
Dang it.

502
00:40:38,136 --> 00:40:40,105
[laughing]

503
00:40:50,916 --> 00:40:55,086
- And just like that,
horror steps from the shadows.

504
00:40:56,221 --> 00:40:57,989
And our freedom was gone...

505
00:40:58,056 --> 00:40:59,825
[music]

506
00:41:20,712 --> 00:41:23,148
- We're gonna ride
into town with Josef

507
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:24,950
and meet the Marshal.

508
00:41:25,016 --> 00:41:26,518
I'd like you with us.

509
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,922
- Somebody needs to be here
in case they come back.

510
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,225
- Cowboys are here.

511
00:41:34,292 --> 00:41:36,227
They've done dealt with
their share of bandits.

512
00:41:36,294 --> 00:41:38,229
[music]

513
00:41:52,077 --> 00:41:53,211
- I'm so sorry.

514
00:41:55,213 --> 00:41:57,783
- What are you sorry about?

515
00:41:57,849 --> 00:41:59,551
You didn't shoot her.

516
00:42:01,152 --> 00:42:02,420
- I'm still sorry.

517
00:42:04,189 --> 00:42:07,492
- Are you?
[scoffs]

518
00:42:10,996 --> 00:42:12,097
- Yes.

519
00:42:12,163 --> 00:42:14,165
- You don't know
what that word means.

520
00:42:17,068 --> 00:42:19,971
But you're going to learn.

521
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:21,773
All of you are going to learn.

522
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:37,122
- Going after them?

523
00:42:37,188 --> 00:42:38,189
- Yeah.

524
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:43,094
- They were rough
and they were rude,

525
00:42:43,161 --> 00:42:45,230
and they were looking for it...

526
00:42:47,465 --> 00:42:49,000
But I can't say
they started it.

527
00:42:51,436 --> 00:42:53,071
- It don't matter
who started it.

528
00:42:54,706 --> 00:42:56,642
- I'm just saying...

529
00:42:56,708 --> 00:42:58,376
Not sure there's justice in it.

530
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:03,314
- I believe in you,
and I believe in that boy,

531
00:43:03,381 --> 00:43:05,516
and I believe in our daughter.

532
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:06,584
And that's all.

533
00:43:09,621 --> 00:43:11,222
Justice don't factor into it.

534
00:43:16,662 --> 00:43:19,564
You know that gun
that's in your saddle bag?

535
00:43:19,631 --> 00:43:20,632
- Yes, sir?

536
00:43:22,668 --> 00:43:24,102

00:43:47,525 --> 00:43:49,761
- Well, if they're here they'll
be at the White Elephant.

542
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:55,967
You're the only one
without a badge.

543
00:43:56,034 --> 00:43:57,769
- Will a badge
make me shoot better?

544
00:43:57,836 --> 00:43:59,337
- Doubtful.

545
00:43:59,404 --> 00:44:03,208
But it'll keep a rope off your
neck if things go sideways.

546
00:44:03,274 --> 00:44:04,642
Raise your right hand.

547
00:44:15,286 --> 00:44:18,089
- Ain't I gotta swear
to something?

548
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:19,691
- You just did.

549
00:44:24,629 --> 00:44:26,998
- What about me?

550
00:44:28,033 --> 00:44:29,134
- What did you say?

551
00:44:31,069 --> 00:44:33,671
- Me. What about me?

552
00:44:33,739 --> 00:44:36,775
- You just keep your trap shut
'til I tell you to open it.

553
00:44:43,048 --> 00:44:45,917
[music]

554
00:45:10,275 --> 00:45:12,978
[piano playing]
Come on, keep up.

555
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:14,045
Come here.

556
00:45:15,747 --> 00:45:17,548
[indistinct chatter]

557
00:45:30,195 --> 00:45:32,730
You see any of 'em,
you point 'em out, all right?

558
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:43,842
All right, any more?

559
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,681
That back table.

560
00:45:54,552 --> 00:45:55,821
Yeah, I know this crew.

561
00:46:03,728 --> 00:46:05,130
Clyde Barker!

562
00:46:10,635 --> 00:46:13,638
What of this business
on the Trinity?

563
00:46:13,704 --> 00:46:16,975
- We were just watering horses
and these immigrants--

564
00:46:17,042 --> 00:46:18,043
[scream]

565
00:46:33,925 --> 00:46:35,093
- Is there any more?

566
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:41,132
Don't just sit there
shaking, are there any more?

567
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:54,712
- I ain't armed.

568
00:46:54,779 --> 00:46:56,181
Them immigrants took my guns.

569
00:46:56,247 --> 00:46:57,482
- I can see that.

570
00:47:13,431 --> 00:47:14,866
If you want to
dance with the girls?

571
00:47:14,933 --> 00:47:15,967
Dance with the girls.

572
00:47:17,368 --> 00:47:19,204
If you want to drink at the bar?
Drink at the bar.

573
00:47:23,441 --> 00:47:26,144
But if anybody here
fancy himself a gunman...

574
00:47:28,646 --> 00:47:30,115
You're in the wrong town.

575
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:35,253
There's only one killer
in Fort Worth and that's me.

576
00:47:47,232 --> 00:47:49,500
[indistinct chatter]

577
00:47:52,137 --> 00:47:54,472
- We're gonna head north
first thing in the morning.

578
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:56,107
- They ain't ready.

579
00:47:56,174 --> 00:47:57,675
- They'd better get ready.

580
00:47:57,742 --> 00:48:00,011
Because everybody in this town
is gonna be looking for us,

581
00:48:00,078 --> 00:48:01,479
and if they find us
they're gonna hang us

582
00:48:01,546 --> 00:48:02,813
from a fucking tree.

583
00:48:07,085 --> 00:48:08,519
- God damnit.

584
00:48:08,586 --> 00:48:10,621
[music]

585
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:27,472
- Did you find them?

586
00:48:27,538 --> 00:48:28,773
- We found them.

587
00:48:31,076 --> 00:48:32,277
- And?

588
00:48:42,053 --> 00:48:43,288
- We murdered them.

589
00:49:04,142 --> 00:49:05,610
[sighs]

590
00:49:26,998 --> 00:49:29,800
- Keep 20 feet between you.

591
00:49:29,867 --> 00:49:31,702
At water you wait to cross

592
00:49:31,769 --> 00:49:34,405
until the wagon
in front of you has crossed.

593
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:37,975
Do not let your children
ride on the buckboard,

594
00:49:38,043 --> 00:49:40,245
they will fall off.

595
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:44,215
Hold your children
and mind your animals.

596
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:54,392
- I figure we'll
see you up to the Red.

597
00:49:54,459 --> 00:49:57,295
Ain't got nuthin better to do.

598
00:49:57,362 --> 00:49:59,897
Besides, there's a
few widows among them now.

599
00:50:01,099 --> 00:50:02,833
- You change your minds as well?

600
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:06,637
- Well, it's the chivalrous
thing to do.

601
00:50:06,704 --> 00:50:08,706
- Earn your keep.

602
00:50:08,773 --> 00:50:10,975
This ain't no travelling
fucking carnival.

603
00:50:12,943 --> 00:50:14,645
- We know what this
is better than you do.

604
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:18,849
- We know what we're
getting into, Captain.

605
00:50:18,916 --> 00:50:20,351
And we earn our keep.

606
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:26,291
[music]

607
00:50:36,301 --> 00:50:37,635
- It's time.

608
00:50:39,737 --> 00:50:40,871
- No.

609
00:50:45,243 --> 00:50:46,644
Don't touch me.

610
00:50:52,683 --> 00:50:54,685
- Go help them hold the cattle.

611
00:50:58,589 --> 00:50:59,857
Let me talk with her.

612
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:07,632
You don't want to go?

613
00:51:07,698 --> 00:51:09,800
- Where are you going, James?

614
00:51:09,867 --> 00:51:14,105
What do you think is waiting
for you out there?

615
00:51:14,172 --> 00:51:15,173
Eden?

616
00:51:16,874 --> 00:51:19,009
Eden is a garden.

617
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:24,048
There are no gardens here.

618
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:27,685
- You plant gardens.
You build them.

619
00:51:29,554 --> 00:51:31,889
- No, gardeners plant
gardens, James.

620
00:51:31,956 --> 00:51:33,491
We are not gardeners.

621
00:51:36,694 --> 00:51:38,163
- You'll die here.

622
00:51:39,697 --> 00:51:41,832
- You say that
like it's a warning.

623
00:51:48,273 --> 00:51:50,708
What do I have left
to live for, James?

624
00:51:55,646 --> 00:51:58,183
I have had seven children...

625
00:51:58,249 --> 00:52:04,121
[music]

626
00:52:04,189 --> 00:52:08,159
and they have all ended up
just like this one.

627
00:52:08,226 --> 00:52:10,428
In the dirt I kneel beside.

628
00:52:13,264 --> 00:52:15,400
I am done kneeling.

629
00:52:17,902 --> 00:52:19,870
I am ready to lay down.

630
00:52:22,507 --> 00:52:25,576
- Well, I can't just
leave you here.

631
00:52:25,643 --> 00:52:27,845
- Well, it's a free
country, remember?

632
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:32,950
It is not your decision to make.
It is mine. And I have made it.

633
00:52:40,558 --> 00:52:41,659
- Goodbye, Claire.

634
00:52:43,194 --> 00:52:45,162
- God damn you, James.

635
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:47,965
God damn you and your dreams.

636
00:52:48,032 --> 00:52:50,668

637
00:52:57,608 --> 00:52:59,544
[sobbing]

638
00:53:24,902 --> 00:53:26,504
- Move 'em, Thomas!

[music]

640
00:53:34,345 --> 00:53:36,180
- Let's go.

641
00:54:01,972 --> 00:54:03,308
- You let her stay?

642
00:54:03,374 --> 00:54:05,876
- I didn't let her do anything.
That choice ain't mine.

643
00:54:06,911 --> 00:54:08,279
Don't look back.

644
00:54:10,815 --> 00:54:12,149
- What are you gonna do?

645
00:54:15,953 --> 00:54:17,422
- I'll catch up.

646
00:54:24,295 --> 00:54:25,696
- Stay in the wagon, son.

647
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:33,037
[music]

648
00:54:47,184 --> 00:54:49,587
- Figure I'd stick around.

649
00:54:49,654 --> 00:54:51,989
Make sure you don't
drown in a river.

650
00:54:52,056 --> 00:54:55,793
- Thought I was too pretty
for you.

651
00:54:55,860 --> 00:55:00,164
- You are, but I'm pretty
short on common sense, so...

652
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:04,702
- I've painted a picture
of my husband in my mind...

653
00:55:06,971 --> 00:55:08,806
And he don't look like you.

654
00:55:08,873 --> 00:55:13,010
- Well, I'm a cowboy, ma'am.

655
00:55:13,077 --> 00:55:14,612
We don't look
like nobody's husband.

656
00:55:16,381 --> 00:55:17,548
But we're the ones
you think about

657
00:55:17,615 --> 00:55:18,949
when your husband ain't around.

658
00:55:20,751 --> 00:55:22,152
[laughing]

659
00:55:25,022 --> 00:55:26,190
- Come on.

660
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:54,485
[chuckles]

661
00:56:04,228 --> 00:56:05,696

00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:48,606
[crying]

663
00:57:01,952 --> 00:57:04,121
- No way to stop her?

664
00:57:04,188 --> 00:57:05,756
- For what?

665
00:57:12,997 --> 00:57:14,965
I've dug my share alone.

666
00:57:15,032 --> 00:57:17,635
- So have I, and wouldn't
wish it on anybody.

667
00:57:21,872 --> 00:57:23,474
I admire her courage.

668
00:57:24,642 --> 00:57:27,411
- It wasn't courage.
- Yes, it was.

00:57:27,478 --> 00:57:30,314

670
00:57:57,374 --> 00:58:00,745
Elsa: What began as a journey
had become a retreat.

671
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:03,113
Into the unknown.

672
00:58:06,917 --> 00:58:09,720
We were backing into the abyss,

673
00:58:09,787 --> 00:58:12,222
so worried our
sins would follow us,

674
00:58:12,289 --> 00:58:14,792
we didn't bother
watching where we walked.

675
00:58:18,663 --> 00:58:21,165
And behind us was a cliff.
