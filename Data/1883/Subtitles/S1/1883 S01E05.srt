1
00:00:09,052 --> 00:00:12,708
I think cities have
weakened us, as a species.

2
00:00:14,231 --> 00:00:16,059
Mistakes have no
consequences there.

3
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:20,107
Step into the road
without looking

4
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:21,750
and the carriage merely
stops or swerves.

5
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,851
The only consequence,
an angry driver.

6
00:00:27,592 --> 00:00:29,942
But here, there can
be no mistakes.

7
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,773
Because here doesn't care.

8
00:00:38,342 --> 00:00:41,345
The river doesn't care
if you can swim.

9
00:00:41,389 --> 00:00:45,262
The snake doesn't care how
much you love your children,

10
00:00:45,306 --> 00:00:47,612
and the wolf has
no interest in your dreams.

11
00:00:49,701 --> 00:00:53,836
If you fail to beat
the current, you will drown.

12
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:56,926
If you get too close,
you will be bitten.

13
00:00:58,406 --> 00:01:01,409
If you are too weak,
you will be eaten.

14
00:01:06,022 --> 00:01:07,458
Let's push 'em back.

15
00:01:12,507 --> 00:01:15,423
We crossed the main
stem of the Brazos River,

16
00:01:15,466 --> 00:01:18,687
just north of the Clear Fork.

17
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:21,516
Though maps say
we are still in Texas,

18
00:01:21,559 --> 00:01:23,605
the convergence of the main stem

19
00:01:23,648 --> 00:01:26,303
and the Clear Fork
is where civilization ends.

20
00:01:28,697 --> 00:01:31,830
The land of no consequence
is behind us.

21
00:01:31,874 --> 00:01:33,789
We are in the land
of no mercy now.

22
00:01:43,668 --> 00:01:46,280
I saw good pasture
to the west.

23
00:01:46,323 --> 00:01:48,586
We're gonna hide them
in a canyon up north.

24
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:51,154
Hide 'em?

25
00:01:51,198 --> 00:01:52,198
Hide 'em from who?

26
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:57,987
Bandits.

27
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,033
What kind of bandits?

28
00:02:01,077 --> 00:02:02,557
Every kind.

29
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,404
Sons of bitches out
here'll steal your bed roll

30
00:02:04,428 --> 00:02:05,428
with you in it.

31
00:02:06,169 --> 00:02:07,257
Hey.

32
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:10,739
Don't go nowhere alone, okay?

33
00:02:14,221 --> 00:02:15,352
Hey.

34
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:18,050
I mean it.

35
00:02:29,497 --> 00:02:30,691
I'm gonna hunt
some high ground.

36
00:02:30,715 --> 00:02:32,413
Have a look around.
Hold 'em here.

37
00:02:53,521 --> 00:02:55,218
Goddammit.

38
00:03:04,532 --> 00:03:06,838
The wagon
was their food wagon.

39
00:03:06,882 --> 00:03:08,013
The one that sunk?

40
00:03:10,668 --> 00:03:12,508
Me and the farmer
saved what we could, but...

41
00:03:13,628 --> 00:03:16,108
They got no food, Captain.

42
00:03:16,152 --> 00:03:19,111
Need to resupply.

43
00:03:19,155 --> 00:03:21,723
We'll cross at Doan's.
Resupply there.

44
00:03:21,766 --> 00:03:23,986
Doan's is a week's ride.

45
00:03:24,029 --> 00:03:25,292
Yep.

46
00:03:27,294 --> 00:03:30,775
Goodnight's ranch
ain't crazy far.

47
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:32,734
Neither is Burke Burnett's.

48
00:03:32,777 --> 00:03:35,040
That country's too rough.

49
00:03:35,084 --> 00:03:36,303
And the wrong direction...

50
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,662
Missing 'em bad
this morning, huh?

51
00:03:47,705 --> 00:03:49,664
I miss 'em bad
every morning, Tom.

52
00:03:52,536 --> 00:03:54,103
That ain't what's
eating at me today.

53
00:03:55,322 --> 00:03:56,366
What's eating you, then?

54
00:03:58,281 --> 00:04:01,719
We're making too many widows.

55
00:04:01,763 --> 00:04:03,504
Too many orphans.

56
00:04:03,547 --> 00:04:05,201
We ain't making nuthin'.

57
00:04:07,334 --> 00:04:09,161
Their deaths ain't our fault.

58
00:04:09,205 --> 00:04:12,600
They're our responsibility.
That makes 'em our fault.

59
00:04:12,643 --> 00:04:16,473
How's this different than
sending soldiers over a hill?

60
00:04:16,517 --> 00:04:18,345
You knew they was gonna die.

61
00:04:18,388 --> 00:04:20,042
You never shed a tear for them.

62
00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:23,001
The hell I didn't.

63
00:05:37,554 --> 00:05:39,034
Breakfast is ready.

64
00:05:39,077 --> 00:05:41,036
John: I'm getting dressed.

65
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:43,212
Well, get dressed faster.

66
00:05:43,255 --> 00:05:47,129
John: I ain't got much practice
of doing this by myself.

67
00:05:52,743 --> 00:05:54,179
What the hell are those?

68
00:05:54,223 --> 00:05:55,703
They grow on the cactus.

69
00:05:57,444 --> 00:05:59,663
How do you know
they're not poisonous?

70
00:05:59,707 --> 00:06:01,273
'Cause I ate one yesterday.

71
00:06:03,101 --> 00:06:04,102
Try it.

72
00:06:06,148 --> 00:06:07,428
I'm gonna make
a jelly out of it.

73
00:06:08,193 --> 00:06:09,412
Mm.

74
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,808
I got dressed
all by myself, mama.

75
00:06:15,244 --> 00:06:17,159
I can see that.

76
00:06:19,596 --> 00:06:21,859
Here you go, son.

77
00:06:26,516 --> 00:06:29,084
Our daughter gonna join
us for breakfast today?

78
00:06:29,127 --> 00:06:30,128
She's with the herd.

79
00:06:31,782 --> 00:06:33,542
She's been with
the herd for almost a week.

80
00:06:36,091 --> 00:06:37,875
It's making
a good cowboy out of her.

81
00:06:41,662 --> 00:06:42,982
I didn't know
that was the goal.

82
00:06:59,244 --> 00:07:01,116
Where are you going?

83
00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:03,074
I don't recall the part
of our vows that said

84
00:07:03,118 --> 00:07:05,120
I need to ask your permission
to go somewhere.

85
00:07:20,135 --> 00:07:21,919
We leaving today?

86
00:07:21,963 --> 00:07:23,878
It's only gonna get hotter.

87
00:07:23,921 --> 00:07:25,706
If we sit around
here like it's Sunday,

88
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:27,577
those folks are gonna
just cook up

89
00:07:27,621 --> 00:07:29,710
whatever food they got left.

90
00:07:29,753 --> 00:07:30,793
We got to keep 'em moving.

91
00:07:33,017 --> 00:07:34,454
We must speak.

92
00:07:38,022 --> 00:07:40,547
All right. Speak.

93
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,897
We ride to one river
and we don't cross

94
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,725
then we ride a week
to a worse river.

95
00:07:44,768 --> 00:07:46,640
We are forced
to leave everything behind

96
00:07:46,683 --> 00:07:47,684
and still we're dying.

97
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:51,688
You are the leader.

98
00:07:51,732 --> 00:07:53,516
You fight amongst yourselves.

99
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,648
Steal from each other.

100
00:07:56,127 --> 00:07:58,042
You don't do what we say

101
00:07:58,086 --> 00:07:59,653
and you do what we
tell you don't do.

102
00:08:04,571 --> 00:08:06,137
As far as river crossings go,

103
00:08:06,181 --> 00:08:07,461
that's as easy
as it's gonna get.

104
00:08:08,705 --> 00:08:10,185
When I say
"don't stop in the middle"

105
00:08:10,228 --> 00:08:12,535
by God, you'd better not stop.

106
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:15,930
We're here to show you
the way, to protect you.

107
00:08:15,973 --> 00:08:17,758
We ain't your people's leader.

108
00:08:17,801 --> 00:08:20,674
That's your job,
you just ain't doing it.

109
00:08:20,717 --> 00:08:22,806
But you better start
because most of your food

110
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,504
is in the bottom of that river

111
00:08:24,547 --> 00:08:27,028
because you decided to put it
all in one fuckin' wagon.

112
00:08:27,071 --> 00:08:28,769
We had no choice.

113
00:08:28,812 --> 00:08:30,292
We...

114
00:08:30,335 --> 00:08:33,295
Mein English...

115
00:08:33,338 --> 00:08:35,863
We are not all friends.
We are not all family.

116
00:08:35,906 --> 00:08:37,604
We came on the same ship
and that is all.

117
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:40,868
Some take from others
whatever they want.

118
00:08:40,911 --> 00:08:42,260
Whatever they need.

119
00:08:42,304 --> 00:08:44,567
We... we put the food together.
To protect it.

120
00:08:47,396 --> 00:08:48,658
Who's stealing?

121
00:08:51,922 --> 00:08:54,490
There's only 43 of you
and you don't know?

122
00:08:56,579 --> 00:08:57,885
I know.

123
00:08:58,625 --> 00:08:59,756
Show me.

124
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:11,812
Set it right there, son.

125
00:09:20,647 --> 00:09:22,649
We should get moving.

126
00:09:22,692 --> 00:09:24,694
We need to take care
of something first.

127
00:09:24,738 --> 00:09:26,653
Come with us.

128
00:09:32,136 --> 00:09:34,661
John, you get in the wagon
and you stay there.

129
00:09:34,704 --> 00:09:35,879
Don't come out. You hear me?

130
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,427
You must give it back.

131
00:10:02,471 --> 00:10:03,777
Give what back?

132
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,257
We lost our food in the river.

133
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:08,303
You must give back
what you took.

134
00:10:08,346 --> 00:10:11,088
Because you lose your food
I must give you mine?

135
00:10:12,786 --> 00:10:15,136
Your food was our food
before you took it.

136
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:17,660
From who did I take? Huh?

137
00:10:19,749 --> 00:10:21,272
From who did I take?

138
00:10:21,316 --> 00:10:22,665
From me.

139
00:10:26,321 --> 00:10:28,018
We traded.

140
00:10:28,062 --> 00:10:30,804
I push your wagon,
and you give food.

141
00:10:30,847 --> 00:10:34,155
You offered to help
then you took the food.

142
00:10:34,198 --> 00:10:35,460
What are you doing?

143
00:10:41,336 --> 00:10:42,685
Let them work it out together.

144
00:10:52,086 --> 00:10:55,045
You don't go in mein wagon.

145
00:10:55,089 --> 00:10:57,744
We have nothing
because of you.

146
00:11:29,471 --> 00:11:31,516
Gonna eat all
that yourself, big boy?

147
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,083
Heh?

148
00:11:41,265 --> 00:11:43,703
There any more?

149
00:11:48,011 --> 00:11:49,011
That one.

150
00:11:53,887 --> 00:11:55,062
I did nothing.

151
00:11:55,105 --> 00:11:56,846
Take me to your wagon
and prove it.

152
00:12:06,551 --> 00:12:07,857
What is this?

153
00:12:07,901 --> 00:12:08,902
A refund.

154
00:12:09,772 --> 00:12:11,774
Find your own way to Oregon.

155
00:12:11,818 --> 00:12:13,167
You follow us and I'll kill you.

156
00:12:18,476 --> 00:12:19,521
Same goes for you.

157
00:12:24,961 --> 00:12:27,790
The only way you survive this
is working together.

158
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:31,489
Leaning on each other.

159
00:12:31,533 --> 00:12:34,623
This trip ain't even got
hard yet, but hard's coming.

160
00:12:37,452 --> 00:12:39,612
The river is what happens
when you don't work together.

161
00:12:42,718 --> 00:12:43,980
That is your leader.

162
00:12:45,242 --> 00:12:47,636
You chose him.

163
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:49,159
Now follow him.

164
00:12:49,203 --> 00:12:50,813
Or choose
someone you will follow.

165
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:54,861
Break your camps
and hitch your teams.

166
00:12:54,904 --> 00:12:55,949
We're leaving in an hour.

167
00:12:59,691 --> 00:13:01,389
I mean it.

168
00:13:01,432 --> 00:13:02,999
To follow us will be
the death of you.

169
00:14:35,831 --> 00:14:36,919
You smell like a goat.

170
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:41,228
I was gonna bathe in the river

171
00:14:41,271 --> 00:14:43,926
but Ennis said
this is bandit country

172
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,449
and not to go anywhere alone.

173
00:14:47,756 --> 00:14:50,106
Sounds like Ennis is
hinting at a bath with you.

174
00:14:51,978 --> 00:14:54,371
He didn't suggest a bath.

175
00:14:54,415 --> 00:14:56,255
If he'd gotten this close
to you he would've.

176
00:15:04,686 --> 00:15:06,079
I kissed him, mama.

177
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:16,872
You mad?

178
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,134
I suppose I should be.

179
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,183
But I kissed a few boys
when I was your age too,

180
00:15:23,226 --> 00:15:24,924
and the world didn't end.

181
00:15:28,275 --> 00:15:29,675
Just don't let it go
beyond kissing.

182
00:15:31,191 --> 00:15:33,584
Why, what's beyond kissing?

183
00:15:35,108 --> 00:15:36,718
You've seen enough
farm animals

184
00:15:36,761 --> 00:15:38,372
to know how babies
are made, Elsa.

185
00:15:38,415 --> 00:15:40,156
I know how they're made.

186
00:15:42,593 --> 00:15:44,813
Haven't fully figured how
it translates to people.

187
00:15:46,684 --> 00:15:47,947
Mm.

188
00:15:49,513 --> 00:15:51,080
You spend enough time
with that cowboy

189
00:15:51,124 --> 00:15:54,040
I'm pretty sure you're going
to find out quick enough.

190
00:15:56,042 --> 00:15:57,478
I recommend you don't though.

191
00:15:59,132 --> 00:16:01,003
I recommend you save it
for someone you love.

192
00:16:05,747 --> 00:16:06,835
Maybe I love him.

193
00:16:09,707 --> 00:16:11,579
I get butterflies
when he looks at me.

194
00:16:13,276 --> 00:16:15,061
I get butterflies when he don't.

195
00:16:16,801 --> 00:16:18,412
That's not love, honey.
That's...

196
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,200
Dammit.

197
00:16:27,725 --> 00:16:30,165
I guess we're gonna have to have
that conversation, aren't we?

198
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,995
Well, I say we kill two birds
with one stone.

199
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:38,039
Come on.

200
00:17:12,901 --> 00:17:14,859
I envy you.

201
00:17:14,903 --> 00:17:15,947
Becoming a woman out here.

202
00:17:21,605 --> 00:17:24,565
No rules or worries

203
00:17:24,608 --> 00:17:26,915
or whispers about
what you should do.

204
00:17:30,788 --> 00:17:33,400
There's no such thing
as freedom, Elsa.

205
00:17:33,443 --> 00:17:34,803
Don't let anyone tell
you there is.

206
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:38,840
There's laws, there's rules

207
00:17:38,883 --> 00:17:41,712
there's customs,
responsibilities everywhere.

208
00:17:41,756 --> 00:17:45,281
The more people
you cram together

209
00:17:45,325 --> 00:17:46,413
the more rules there'll be.

210
00:17:51,461 --> 00:17:53,061
I don't know what life
is like in Oregon,

211
00:17:55,161 --> 00:17:56,510
but there'll be rules there too.

212
00:18:04,474 --> 00:18:08,261
This trail is as
free as you'll ever be.

213
00:18:12,482 --> 00:18:13,882
The only rules
you need to follow...

214
00:18:17,661 --> 00:18:19,315
are the ones in your heart.

215
00:18:29,238 --> 00:18:30,848
We gonna talk about sex now?

216
00:18:34,896 --> 00:18:36,115
We just did.

217
00:18:50,955 --> 00:18:51,956
Oh.

218
00:18:53,219 --> 00:18:54,829
I-I-I'm sorry, I was, uh...

219
00:18:56,091 --> 00:18:58,963
We, I had to... We, uh...

220
00:18:59,007 --> 00:19:00,617
Put your tongue
in your mouth, son.

221
00:19:00,661 --> 00:19:02,837
It helps you speak better.

222
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,795
Ye-Yes, ma'am.

223
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:08,190
The, uh...
The wagons are moving.

224
00:19:08,234 --> 00:19:11,324
I thought we were
leaving tomorrow.

225
00:19:11,367 --> 00:19:12,367
Leaving now, ma'am.

226
00:19:13,848 --> 00:19:15,328
All right.

227
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:19,941
We'll get dressed.

228
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,335
Yes, ma'am.

229
00:19:24,206 --> 00:19:25,294
Once you leave.

230
00:19:27,905 --> 00:19:30,169
Yes ma'am. Sorry. I'm leaving.

231
00:19:39,874 --> 00:19:42,398
I envy you, honey.
I really do.

232
00:19:48,143 --> 00:19:49,362
Hup, hup.

233
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,880
You helping with
the herd, Mrs. Dutton?

234
00:19:56,804 --> 00:19:58,004
I should go check on my son.

235
00:20:01,112 --> 00:20:02,832
If you see Thomas,
could you send for him?

236
00:20:03,854 --> 00:20:05,639
Everything alright?

237
00:20:05,682 --> 00:20:08,119
Everything's fine, ma'am.

238
00:20:08,163 --> 00:20:10,444
If you can spare your husband,
would you send him as well?

239
00:20:12,515 --> 00:20:14,213
I'll send them both.

240
00:20:23,613 --> 00:20:26,703
We're gonna push these cattle
right behind the wagons.

241
00:20:26,747 --> 00:20:27,748
Keep 'em close.

242
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:48,290
Is this America?

243
00:20:50,901 --> 00:20:53,513
Where is this...
Where is this freedom?

244
00:20:56,472 --> 00:20:58,866
Where is this justice?

245
00:21:02,086 --> 00:21:04,263
You are sheep with no shepherd.

246
00:21:10,225 --> 00:21:11,357
You follow the wolves.

247
00:21:14,098 --> 00:21:15,665
You follow the wolves!

248
00:21:23,891 --> 00:21:26,285
I'm a man of my word.

249
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:27,721
If you ever see my face again,

250
00:21:27,764 --> 00:21:29,549
it'll be the last thing you see.

251
00:21:42,431 --> 00:21:45,478
In less than three weeks,
we had shrunk by half.

252
00:21:45,521 --> 00:21:49,525
Eight men, six women,
and four children had died.

253
00:21:49,569 --> 00:21:52,572
And now we leave
at least that many behind...

254
00:21:52,615 --> 00:21:57,272
If strength is in numbers,
then we are growing weaker.

255
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,274
When we need our strength
the most.

256
00:22:12,722 --> 00:22:14,724
I make six of them.

257
00:22:14,768 --> 00:22:16,639
No shoes.

258
00:22:16,683 --> 00:22:19,033
We're a ways
from the reservation.

259
00:22:19,076 --> 00:22:20,687
Maybe just hunting.

260
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:24,299
Naw, they ain't travel
this far to hunt.

261
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,996
They know we're going
water to water.

262
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,307
Keep everything close tonight.

263
00:22:50,412 --> 00:22:52,052
They look like
they're starving already.

264
00:22:54,329 --> 00:22:56,418
In this heat,
walking this rough trail,

265
00:22:56,462 --> 00:22:57,941
it don't take long to starve.

266
00:23:00,422 --> 00:23:02,772
It'll hit them kids first.

267
00:23:02,816 --> 00:23:05,079
We should chip our
rations in with theirs.

268
00:23:05,122 --> 00:23:06,254
Already did.

269
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:09,170
How about you?

270
00:23:11,477 --> 00:23:13,392
That ain't part
of our bargain.

271
00:23:13,435 --> 00:23:14,828
You gonna watch them starve?

272
00:23:16,482 --> 00:23:18,919
There's fifty head
of cattle right there.

273
00:23:18,962 --> 00:23:21,400
Ain't nobody got to starve.

274
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:23,227
When we leave Kansas,

275
00:23:23,271 --> 00:23:25,360
there ain't no trading
posts 'till Wyoming.

276
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,362
That's a month.

277
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,669
We need to save the cattle.

278
00:23:29,712 --> 00:23:31,627
I won't risk
my family for theirs.

279
00:23:33,803 --> 00:23:36,415
You will chip in with us
or you will go your own way.

280
00:23:39,374 --> 00:23:41,463
My wagon wheels
don't strip so easy, Captain.

281
00:23:43,813 --> 00:23:45,815
You need a cook
with his own wagon

282
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:47,469
and the skill to drive it,
otherwise...

283
00:23:47,513 --> 00:23:51,342
you're going to end up
in the same situation next week.

284
00:23:51,386 --> 00:23:56,043
You want my rations,
that's my price.

285
00:23:56,086 --> 00:23:58,741
I'll hire the first one I see
when we get to Doan's,

286
00:23:58,785 --> 00:23:59,786
you have my word.

287
00:24:01,744 --> 00:24:02,824
I'm gonna hold you to it.

288
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:32,296
What's wrong?

289
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,733
Somebody's following us.

290
00:24:34,777 --> 00:24:36,518
Bandits.

291
00:24:36,562 --> 00:24:37,563
Could be.

292
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,980
I want you to sleep
with the wagons tonight.

293
00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:48,369
Cattle and horses ain't the only
thing they steal out here.

294
00:24:48,965 --> 00:24:49,965
You understand me?

295
00:24:52,012 --> 00:24:52,969
Yessir.

296
00:24:53,013 --> 00:24:54,493
Go right to camp.

297
00:26:17,706 --> 00:26:20,187
What an odd thing, attraction.

298
00:26:21,318 --> 00:26:22,318
It consumes you.

299
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,497
Stronger than hunger

300
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:29,718
or fear or anything
I've ever felt.

301
00:26:31,677 --> 00:26:33,896
I feel it everywhere.

302
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:36,116
My hands...

303
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,728
my stomach, my toes...

304
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:40,920
Hey... hey...

305
00:27:40,963 --> 00:27:43,487
You know what to do?

306
00:27:43,531 --> 00:27:44,793
You done this before?

307
00:27:45,489 --> 00:27:46,534
Sort of.

308
00:27:47,753 --> 00:27:48,753
Sort of?

309
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:52,018
Yeah.

310
00:27:52,061 --> 00:27:54,411
Uh... In Dodge City.

311
00:27:57,371 --> 00:28:01,288
I paid a woman
to show me, but...

312
00:28:02,376 --> 00:28:03,377
It didn't work.

313
00:28:05,901 --> 00:28:07,033
Didn't work how?

314
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:14,736
I didn't like her,
my body, it wouldn't...

315
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:22,396
She couldn't make me feel like
this no matter what I paid her.

316
00:28:25,573 --> 00:28:28,837
But I... I know what to do...

317
00:28:28,881 --> 00:28:29,882
If you want me to do it.

318
00:28:34,843 --> 00:28:36,584
I want you to do it.

319
00:28:55,908 --> 00:28:57,823
The whole world faded away.

320
00:28:59,563 --> 00:29:01,043
No more stars or moon.

321
00:29:02,479 --> 00:29:03,479
No sky at all.

322
00:29:05,178 --> 00:29:06,396
No earth between my feet.

323
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,313
No rock against my back.

324
00:29:13,316 --> 00:29:14,883
There was only us.

325
00:32:52,013 --> 00:32:53,013
Morning.

326
00:32:57,671 --> 00:32:59,978
I said good morning.

327
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,021
You'd better be careful.

328
00:33:05,809 --> 00:33:06,810
Careful with what?

329
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:09,570
You're a woman now, ain't you?

330
00:33:11,946 --> 00:33:13,746
And woman to woman...
You'd better be careful.

331
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,359
It takes years to make
something of your life.

332
00:33:20,389 --> 00:33:22,309
One decision can change
the course of it forever.

333
00:33:24,263 --> 00:33:27,744
And we don't know
if that decision

334
00:33:27,788 --> 00:33:29,964
is gonna be the one that sinks
us until we make it.

335
00:33:32,575 --> 00:33:35,143
So you'd better be very,
very careful what you choose.

336
00:33:40,105 --> 00:33:42,020
Freedom is anything but, Elsa.

337
00:33:44,587 --> 00:33:46,937
And every choice has fangs.
Do you understand me?

338
00:33:48,765 --> 00:33:52,334
Yes, ma'am.

339
00:33:52,378 --> 00:33:54,380
We're so past "ma'am".

340
00:33:57,165 --> 00:33:59,080
If you have a child
you'll raise it.

341
00:34:00,255 --> 00:34:01,691
I will not do it for you.

342
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:05,869
Having a hard enough
time raising my own,

343
00:34:05,913 --> 00:34:07,480
as you can clearly see.

344
00:34:18,621 --> 00:34:19,981
And if you decide
to do it again...

345
00:34:22,843 --> 00:34:25,237
Do it outside of earshot
of the damn camp.

346
00:34:28,718 --> 00:34:30,111
Does daddy know?

347
00:34:33,636 --> 00:34:34,956
Your father's
watching the herd.

348
00:34:52,002 --> 00:34:53,265
If I have a baby...

349
00:34:56,224 --> 00:34:57,443
I'll raise it.

350
00:35:00,185 --> 00:35:01,305
Will he raise it with you?

351
00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:03,840
I'll ask...

352
00:35:04,841 --> 00:35:06,104
I suggest you do that.

353
00:35:18,594 --> 00:35:20,335
I don't regret it, mama.

354
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:26,166
It was beautiful.

355
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:30,039
And I don't regret it.

356
00:35:33,827 --> 00:35:36,027
Just once I'd love to see
the world through your eyes.

357
00:35:39,049 --> 00:35:40,729
One day you'll see
it through mine, though.

358
00:35:42,052 --> 00:35:43,315
And it breaks my heart.

359
00:36:07,861 --> 00:36:09,210
Freedom.

360
00:36:10,429 --> 00:36:12,909
Freedom is
accepting consequences.

361
00:36:13,954 --> 00:36:16,739
Embracing them.

362
00:36:16,783 --> 00:36:18,480
Wrapping them
around you like a blanket.

363
00:36:20,265 --> 00:36:21,570
I choose to love him.

364
00:36:22,832 --> 00:36:26,184
I choose to let him love me.

365
00:36:26,227 --> 00:36:30,188
If the consequence is a child,
I'll choose to love that too.

366
00:36:36,803 --> 00:36:38,963
If I have a baby are you man
enough to help raise it?

367
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:44,854
Well?

368
00:36:47,379 --> 00:36:49,250
You ain't like anyone
I ever met.

369
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,822
Hell, yes, I'm man enough.

370
00:36:57,606 --> 00:36:59,042
I doubt I'm that lucky though.

371
00:37:05,005 --> 00:37:07,399
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

372
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:09,923
I'm gonna go tell daddy.

373
00:37:12,055 --> 00:37:13,709
Tell daddy what?

374
00:37:13,753 --> 00:37:15,450
That we're getting married.

375
00:37:27,941 --> 00:37:31,814
Think you got women
all figured out, don't you?

376
00:37:31,858 --> 00:37:34,904
I don't think there's
any figuring that one out.

377
00:37:34,948 --> 00:37:37,255
What you need to figure out
is her father and quick.

378
00:37:37,298 --> 00:37:39,058
'Cause that son of a bitch
is gonna kill you.

379
00:37:40,997 --> 00:37:42,042
You think he knows?

380
00:37:43,696 --> 00:37:46,002
The whole fuckin' camp knows.

381
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:54,446
Daddy.

382
00:38:05,326 --> 00:38:06,545
What is that?

383
00:38:13,378 --> 00:38:14,596
What do you think that is?

384
00:38:16,076 --> 00:38:17,295
Same thing you think it is.

385
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:31,134
What do you want to do?

386
00:38:31,178 --> 00:38:32,397
Got no choice.

387
00:38:35,835 --> 00:38:38,141
Six of them, you think?

388
00:38:38,185 --> 00:38:39,534
Six horses anyway.

389
00:38:42,407 --> 00:38:43,407
We need more guns.

390
00:38:44,452 --> 00:38:45,975
I'll take four good fighters

391
00:38:46,019 --> 00:38:48,064
over eight poor fighters
any day.

392
00:38:56,682 --> 00:38:59,002
You know how to use those things
or are they just for show?

393
00:39:00,425 --> 00:39:01,706
I been riding this
country fifteen years,

394
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:04,298
what do you think?

395
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,039
What about you?

396
00:39:10,391 --> 00:39:14,134
I... I ain't never killed nobody
but by God I know how.

397
00:39:16,702 --> 00:39:18,573
Let's get to camp
and figure this out.

398
00:39:29,192 --> 00:39:30,542
You ain't going nowhere.

399
00:39:39,899 --> 00:39:41,553
Daddy!

400
00:39:41,596 --> 00:39:43,685
I love him.

401
00:39:43,729 --> 00:39:45,600
You don't know
what that word means.

402
00:39:46,427 --> 00:39:47,559
I chose it.

403
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,257
I went to him.

404
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:53,173
I know what that word means,
and I love him.

405
00:40:08,536 --> 00:40:11,365
I'll take your licks
if you got more to give.

406
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,627
I'm a man and I'll take 'em.

407
00:40:16,109 --> 00:40:17,109
I'll take her, too.

408
00:40:19,329 --> 00:40:20,548
Will you?

409
00:40:22,898 --> 00:40:23,899
That's how you ask?

410
00:40:24,944 --> 00:40:26,424
I ain't asking nothing.

411
00:40:28,208 --> 00:40:29,427
If she loves me...

412
00:40:32,212 --> 00:40:33,300
I'm taking it.

413
00:40:34,823 --> 00:40:36,172
If you won't give her to me,

414
00:40:36,216 --> 00:40:39,262
I'll goddam steal her,
I swear it.

415
00:40:48,054 --> 00:40:49,708
You got it all figured out,
don't you?

416
00:41:02,242 --> 00:41:03,504
You say you love her...

417
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:06,290
but you won't
ever love her like I do.

418
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:10,424
That's my heart
you're running off with.

419
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,949
You'd better
cradle it like an egg.

420
00:41:17,083 --> 00:41:18,998
I will, sir.

421
00:41:22,828 --> 00:41:24,177
I will.

422
00:41:27,354 --> 00:41:28,355
A little warning.

423
00:41:30,444 --> 00:41:31,967
That girl is gonna
run you ragged.

424
00:41:34,622 --> 00:41:36,182
It's already got
that look to it, sir.

425
00:41:39,105 --> 00:41:41,847
Mount up.
Let's get back to camp.

426
00:42:44,692 --> 00:42:45,693
I love you.

427
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:48,304
I love you.

428
00:42:50,916 --> 00:42:54,049
What if they come
back around for us instead?

429
00:42:54,093 --> 00:42:56,008
They won't.

430
00:42:56,051 --> 00:42:57,226
But what if they do, James?

431
00:42:58,663 --> 00:43:00,273
Then you fight
like a damn panther

432
00:43:00,316 --> 00:43:01,361
until I get back to you.

433
00:43:06,671 --> 00:43:08,455
Let's get her moving.

434
00:44:28,883 --> 00:44:30,842
She'll be worth something.

435
00:44:34,367 --> 00:44:36,499
Lots of feathers
to pluck off that chicken.

436
00:44:59,522 --> 00:45:01,307
We wait for dark?

437
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:03,048
What for?

438
00:45:03,091 --> 00:45:04,223
It's just one wagon.

439
00:46:18,993 --> 00:46:20,212
Man: Smells good.

440
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:42,407
Where is your horse?

441
00:46:43,496 --> 00:46:45,106
I was hopin' you'd know.

442
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:46,716
Damn bugger bucked me off.

443
00:46:49,023 --> 00:46:50,111
You out here alone?

444
00:46:51,852 --> 00:46:52,852
With my husband.

445
00:46:55,725 --> 00:46:56,726
Don't see no husband.

446
00:47:00,992 --> 00:47:03,168
He went for water.

447
00:47:03,211 --> 00:47:04,822
Well, he's gonna be gone
a while then.

448
00:47:06,214 --> 00:47:07,433
Ain't much water around here.

449
00:47:11,959 --> 00:47:12,959
Whatcha cookin'?

450
00:47:14,483 --> 00:47:16,050
Stew.

451
00:47:18,705 --> 00:47:19,924
That a fact?

452
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:23,841
Ah, come on.

453
00:47:25,364 --> 00:47:26,844
You fucking bitch!

454
00:47:41,815 --> 00:47:43,686
Run! Run!

455
00:48:13,151 --> 00:48:15,718
Liza! Liza!

456
00:48:20,985 --> 00:48:22,203
What is this place?

457
00:48:23,988 --> 00:48:26,860
Where are you taking me?

458
00:48:33,388 --> 00:48:35,303
Shoot 'em! Shoot 'em!

459
00:48:52,799 --> 00:48:54,409
Keep shooting, keep firing!

460
00:49:18,477 --> 00:49:20,131
You got that pistol with you?

461
00:49:20,174 --> 00:49:21,610
In my saddle bags.

462
00:49:21,654 --> 00:49:22,654
Get it out.

463
00:50:39,123 --> 00:50:40,863
I loved her.

464
00:50:44,171 --> 00:50:45,390
I don't doubt it, son.

465
00:51:59,725 --> 00:52:04,469
No! No! No!

466
00:52:08,647 --> 00:52:10,344
Please...

467
00:52:10,388 --> 00:52:11,911
No! No, no, no.

468
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:56,651
I'd known death
since I was a child.

469
00:52:57,696 --> 00:52:58,914
It's everywhere.

470
00:53:00,786 --> 00:53:02,353
But it had never touched me.

471
00:53:04,355 --> 00:53:07,445
It had never placed
its rotten finger on my heart.

472
00:53:09,708 --> 00:53:11,013
Until today.

473
00:53:12,711 --> 00:53:14,539
Today, my eyes died.

474
00:53:16,454 --> 00:53:18,717
I see the world
through my mother's eyes now.

475
00:53:21,676 --> 00:53:25,202
Yes, freedom has fangs.

476
00:53:26,681 --> 00:53:28,335
And it sunk them in me.

477
00:53:33,297 --> 00:53:36,125
I chose to love him.

478
00:53:36,169 --> 00:53:37,736
He chose to love me back.

479
00:53:39,868 --> 00:53:41,653
Then chose to protect me..

480
00:53:45,526 --> 00:53:48,007
Then a man we've never
met chose to kill him...

481
00:53:52,881 --> 00:53:54,013
and made me color blind.

482
00:54:09,115 --> 00:54:12,597
Maybe killing this man
will get my eyes back.

483
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:13,685
Maybe it won't.

484
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:16,470
But I chose to find out.
