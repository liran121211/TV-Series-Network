1
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:28,795
The numbing shock of war
is behind me now.

2
00:00:28,861 --> 00:00:30,263
Pain has taken its place.

3
00:00:34,902 --> 00:00:36,936
Hurts to move.

4
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:38,106
Hurts to breathe.

5
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:42,409
The back of my head throbs
with every step of my horse.

6
00:00:51,252 --> 00:00:55,523
I look at the world through
the hazy lens of fever,

7
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:57,658
and somehow see it clearer.

8
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:14,575
Run little rabbit.

9
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,718
What is death?

10
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:28,588
What is this thing
we all share...

11
00:01:28,656 --> 00:01:34,162
rabbits, birds, horses, trees...

12
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:40,134
Everyone I love
and everyone who loves me...

13
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,902
even stars die...

14
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:46,105
And we know absolutely
nothing of it.

15
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:25,846
State your business
with the fort.

16
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:30,884
You're boys.

17
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,286
State your business.

18
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:36,088
Who are you gonna protect?

19
00:02:37,425 --> 00:02:39,627
I guess I'll protect
who needs protecting.

20
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:43,864
You should spend some time
outside these walls

21
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,665
before you make that statement.

22
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:51,305
State your business
or be on your way.

23
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:03,150
Don't touch her!

24
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:07,788
- What's wrong with her?
We don't need no smallpox.

25
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,389
She got shot.

26
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:10,657
Get the surgeon.

27
00:03:12,925 --> 00:03:13,925
Follow me.

28
00:03:15,027 --> 00:03:16,027
Come on, baby.

29
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:30,403
Major, a woman needs help.

30
00:04:37,345 --> 00:04:39,312
- What happened?
- She was shot.

31
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,451
Gonna need to summon
yer staff, Major.

32
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:47,220
Got two more coming behind...
Head wound and a snake bite.

33
00:04:47,286 --> 00:04:49,790
Well, just list
the ailments, sir.

34
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:51,191
I'll decide who to summon.

35
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:56,238
Looks like she's already
been treated.

36
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:58,031
Just a battle dressing.

37
00:04:58,098 --> 00:05:00,434
Is there a battle
that I'm not I'm unaware of?

38
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,370
Gunfights do not a battle make.

39
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,204
Captain.

40
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:07,608
Gunfights do not
a battle make, "Captain."

41
00:05:07,675 --> 00:05:10,711
Believe me when I say,
I know the difference, Major.

42
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,884
- This wound is from an arrow.
- Mm-hm.

43
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:24,358
Swelling in her liver.

44
00:05:25,593 --> 00:05:27,127
I suggest you get her
to Fort Laramie.

45
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:28,495
Nothing I can do for you here.

46
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:31,764
I got no porters,
no nurses, no staff at all.

47
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,067
How can you man a fort
without a staff?

48
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:36,536
There is no fort.

49
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:38,338
It's been abandoned.

50
00:05:38,406 --> 00:05:41,509
We're meeting engineers
from Pacific Northwest

51
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:46,178
as they map a path
for the railroad north and east.

52
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:48,749
No more wagons for this country.

53
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:50,918
- Who is she to you?
- She's my daughter.

54
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,423
The arrow hit her liver.

55
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:57,891
Hard enough to recover
from a bullet through the liver,

56
00:05:57,957 --> 00:05:59,292
let alone an arrow.

57
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:02,062
Those things are filthy
and half the time poisoned.

58
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:05,365
And even if her liver does heal,
sepsis is in her.

59
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:10,336
I'm not saying it can't be beat,
but I've never seen it.

60
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:13,507
Just get her strong enough
to travel, that's all I ask.

61
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:15,509
- Travel?
She's done traveling.

62
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:17,911
Laramie is as far as she goes.
If you're lucky.

63
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:19,680
Best you can hope for
is that she wakes

64
00:06:19,747 --> 00:06:21,615
and you get to say goodbye.

65
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:22,783
I'll get my bag.

66
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,774
Move!

67
00:06:56,082 --> 00:07:00,086
You ain't no soldiers
but you're manning a fort.

68
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,322
We're with the CY Ranch.

69
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:04,423
The ranch owns the fort.

70
00:07:04,492 --> 00:07:08,762
CY part of the Wyoming
Stock Grower's Association?

71
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:12,865
- Part of it.
Mr. Carey founded it.

72
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,033
Don't that figure.

73
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,137
Y'all need rooms
for the night?

74
00:07:17,204 --> 00:07:18,038
We rent 'em.

75
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:19,372
We're gonna keep moving.

76
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:29,582
Where'd they go?

77
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:44,697
We head to Laramie.

78
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:46,834
All this land is owned
by the boss

79
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:48,668
of those deputies we killed.

80
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:51,838
This fort included.

81
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:54,141
- Go north.
Hit the Bozeman trail.

82
00:07:54,206 --> 00:07:56,909
That'll put us in Montana
for the winter.

83
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,478
You think this place is wild.

84
00:07:59,547 --> 00:08:03,584
Ain't gonna take them long
for those deputies we killed.

85
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:05,552
This whole country
will be hunting us.

86
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:06,553
Again.

87
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,588
Your daughter needs a doctor.

88
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:15,562
What's a doctor
gonna do for her?

89
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:17,329
You been to war.
I have too.

90
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,735
Three days.

91
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:24,538
Her liver either heals
or it fails.

92
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:28,375
And if it heals,
she's got another week maybe.

93
00:08:30,442 --> 00:08:31,612
Yeah.

94
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,849
I gotta talk to my wife.

95
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:52,465
Walk with me?

96
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:56,581
John, go check
on your sister, okay?

97
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:04,076
We can't wait it out here.

98
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:05,678
Why not?

99
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:07,715
- Doesn't matter why.
We just can't.

100
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,450
Ain't no doctor can help her.

101
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:12,019
Nobody can.

102
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,860
And we ain't gonna lay her
to rest here.

103
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:22,596
We keep heading north.

104
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:26,799
Where she dies,
that's where we stay.

105
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:27,934
She'll be with us.

106
00:09:30,037 --> 00:09:32,538
And you can visit her
any time you want.

107
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:34,040
Oh, I'll be there every day.

108
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,645
Until you put me in the ground
right beside her.

109
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,067
I need everyone
to gather around.

110
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:12,712
We're gonna head north
from here.

111
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,248
Winter in the Bozeman valley,

112
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:17,918
then push on to Oregon
in the spring.

113
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,022
- No no no.
We go to Oregon now.

114
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:23,523
In the springtime.

115
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,091
You promised.

116
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:27,527
I'm keeping my promise...

117
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:29,863
I just changed the way
I'm keeping it.

118
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:32,231
Get ready to leave.

119
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:39,873
Captain, these folks
need a few days.

120
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,875
Gotta get Josef to the doctor.

121
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:45,044
- There is no doctor.
Just more of those thieves.

122
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:47,780
And if we stay around here,
they're gonna hang us.

123
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:49,649
We are staying.

124
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:52,753
The trail is easy enough
to follow now.

125
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,721
We will make it to Oregon
without you.

126
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:55,788
Suit yourself.

127
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:15,042
- Wait. Wait...
We go with you.

128
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,177
Show me your leg.

129
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:22,349
Show me your leg.

130
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:32,459
You can't drive.

131
00:11:32,524 --> 00:11:34,061
You can't walk.

132
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:35,361
She can't drive.

133
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:38,465
How am I supposed
to take you with me?

134
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:39,530
I'll drive it.

135
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:47,307
- They're gonna die.
- Then they die.

136
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:51,010
They're free people now.
That's what they chose.

137
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:56,249
Ain't my job to tell you
what to drive.

138
00:12:05,457 --> 00:12:07,577
We got a herd of cattle just
sitting in the prairie.

139
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:10,596
Leave 'em.

140
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:13,399
What do you want us to do?

141
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:14,634
What do you want to do?

142
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:17,470
I hate turning my back
to ya, but...

143
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:20,273
If we ain't pushing cattle
for you, we ain't much use.

144
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:44,496
Where are we goin'?

145
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:46,899
Montana, honey.

146
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:51,403
Wonder what that'll be like.

147
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:01,347
It was a hell of a thing
riding with you.

148
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:04,017
It was a hell
of a thing riding with you.

149
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:07,586
Colton: Wasn't a day on this
drive I was prettier than you.

150
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:09,688
You'll always the be one that
got away, Elsa.

151
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:12,558
Colton, you gotta be pretty
damn good looking

152
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,062
to think the one you never
had got away from you.

153
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:20,033
Go back to Texas,
you pretty son of a bitch.

154
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:22,970
Ma'am.

155
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:36,048
I wondered
what became of them.

156
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:38,018
Wondered if they staked their
claim in Wyoming

157
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:40,120
and built sod houses,

158
00:13:40,187 --> 00:13:44,323
bought cattle and tried to
scratch a life from this place.

159
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,894
Or perhaps they fought
the winter and braved their way

160
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,962
to Oregon, laying stakes
in the emerald fields

161
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:53,133
of the Willamette Valley.

162
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,403
But I'd seen too much
of this world...

163
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:59,605
knew too much
about the nature of man

164
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:03,309
to think either would be
their future.

165
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:06,778
Another future awaited them,
and it lay in the abyss

166
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:10,549
of unmarked graves
along the Oregon Trail.

167
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:13,513
She any better today?

168
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,682
She won't take water.

169
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:19,719
Mm.

170
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,923
Your leg is dying.

171
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:27,460
And the death is working
its way up.

172
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:32,631
Now, we can take the leg...

173
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,033
or you can die with it.

174
00:15:35,934 --> 00:15:37,570
Those are your choices.

175
00:15:39,871 --> 00:15:41,207
You know this?

176
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:44,411
I know it.

177
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:47,219
You know how to take the leg?

178
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,881
I know how.

179
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:55,553
Take it.

180
00:15:57,889 --> 00:15:58,889
Okay.

181
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:10,136
♪ Lullaby and goodnight... ♪

182
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:12,772
Margaret's been holding
out on us.

183
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:14,673
She only sings for the kids.

184
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:17,543
Not for you?

185
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:22,548
She promised me she'd sing
at my funeral,

186
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:26,052
but she made me promise
she'd die first, so...

187
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:28,754
Got horse traded out of my song.

188
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:33,625
Women will strike some tricky
bargains, won't they.

189
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:36,028
I've never come out
on the winning end of one yet.

190
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,631
During the war, I got
a telegraph from my wife

191
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:42,302
that said she was taking
another lover.

192
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:46,105
And leaving with him on Friday.

193
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:48,540
It was a Monday when I got
the telegraph.

194
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:51,443
So, I got my sword real goddam
sharp to slice

195
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,114
that son of a bitch,
and rode two days straight.

196
00:16:56,482 --> 00:17:01,888
When I got there she ran out
of the house and...

197
00:17:01,953 --> 00:17:03,322
tackled me in a hug.

198
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:10,196
Said she'd read the Rebels
were in Pennsylvania

199
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:13,932
and she dreamed that I was gonna
die on a battlefield

200
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,067
at Gettysburg.

201
00:17:18,605 --> 00:17:20,807
That dirty, little liar
saved my life.

202
00:17:28,615 --> 00:17:30,517
Josef's leg got's to come off.

203
00:17:31,983 --> 00:17:33,853
We should do it now.

204
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:37,189
All right.

205
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,415
Thank you.

206
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:16,996
So we do this now?

207
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:18,964
Not yet.

208
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:22,101
Not till you're so drunk
you can't see straight.

209
00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:24,737
Need about half
that bottle in you.

210
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:26,239
I'm German.

211
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:28,441
Half this bottle
I'm just hitting my stride

212
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:46,858
We had these stupid French
running through the streets

213
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:49,195
of Paris like dogs.

214
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:52,632
A-le-a-le-a-le...

215
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,236
You know what the hell
he's talking about?

216
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:01,140
Some battle.

217
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:02,275
Don't matter.

218
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:04,411
Sumbitch can drink that whiskey.

219
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:08,315
Josef: What no one...
understands about a battle

220
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:10,115
is the noise.

221
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:14,153
The noise of it...

222
00:19:14,221 --> 00:19:17,624
When they start,
you can hear the man

223
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:21,928
beside you scream over
the bombs and rifles.

224
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:29,769
Before long, you can't hear
the bombs over the screams...

225
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:32,204
Now we're getting somewhere.

226
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:35,375
Finish that last swig, Josef.

227
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:48,287
Fuck.

228
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:56,127
That ain't one
of yer good ones, is it?

229
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:57,514
I don't have
a good one.

230
00:20:03,134 --> 00:20:05,704
No, no, I'm not ready.

231
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:19,151
You just lay right there
and take a nap.

232
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,619
We ain't starting nuthin'.

233
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:21,753
Don't you...

234
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,589
We ain't doing nuthin'.

235
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:24,957
Just lay back and rest.

236
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,628
Let's give him a few minutes.

237
00:20:44,544 --> 00:20:46,546
Y'all put your knees
on his arms.

238
00:20:46,613 --> 00:20:49,281
Press your hands
into his shoulders, hard.

239
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:50,828
Thomas,
you might need that.

240
00:20:53,353 --> 00:20:54,252
Which leg you want?

241
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,755
I'm working the saw.

242
00:20:55,822 --> 00:20:57,589
I got the cutting leg.

243
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,828
He's gonna try to kick the life
out of you when he comes to.

244
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:04,330
I don't think he's coming to.

245
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:06,699
Well, he's coming to.

246
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,468
Okay
Slow down.

247
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,413
Cut around to the bone
first, yeah?

248
00:21:22,348 --> 00:21:23,816
I'd go right to the saw.

249
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:27,219
It'll heal better this way.

250
00:21:28,855 --> 00:21:29,855
Okay.

251
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:33,792
All right, y'all get on him.

252
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:57,950
Hold on.

253
00:22:04,891 --> 00:22:07,559
Hold him! Hold him!

254
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,135
Oh, my God.

255
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:25,511
Gotta bury that leg.

256
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:27,779
He don't need to see a coyote
running through the plains

257
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:28,948
with his foot tomorrow.

258
00:22:32,785 --> 00:22:33,986
Y'all can get up now.

259
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:37,957
Are we in Montana?

260
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:46,465
Almost.

261
00:22:47,534 --> 00:22:48,667
Hm.

262
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:51,837
- Honey, you need to lay down.
- Mm.

263
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:55,074
- I'm cold.
Wanna sit by the fire.

264
00:23:18,931 --> 00:23:20,332
There anything to eat?

265
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:23,603
I can sure make you something
real quick.

266
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,752
I'm sure glad I didn't get
shot in the leg.

267
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,730
Gonna have to hold out
for about fifteen minutes.

268
00:23:56,335 --> 00:23:57,403
I ain't going nowhere.

269
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:07,046
Fever's broke.

270
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:10,849
Color's back too.
That's good.

271
00:24:13,653 --> 00:24:15,221
How's the pain.

272
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:18,525
It's there,
but not like it was.

273
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:25,832
You want some bacon?

274
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:28,968
Sure.

275
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:46,519
Y'all made good time.

276
00:24:46,586 --> 00:24:49,221
Went from prairie to pine trees
in a day.

277
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:52,057
We left the fort
three days ago.

278
00:24:55,394 --> 00:24:56,729
Oh.

279
00:25:00,266 --> 00:25:04,336
- Slept my way here, I guess.
- Yeah, honey. You sure did.

280
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:33,799
I'm not sure
what Oregon looks like

281
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,734
but I bet it don't
look like this.

282
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:40,038
Should have aimed for this place
from the start.

283
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:43,918
I don't know what Oregon looks
like either, honey,

284
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:47,479
but this is hard to beat.

285
00:25:49,015 --> 00:25:52,084
The only people who know what
it looks like are already there.

286
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:57,056
Funny, when you think about it.

287
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:02,828
All those people from Europe...

288
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,029
Don't speak our language...

289
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:08,233
Don't know anything
about this place.

290
00:26:08,299 --> 00:26:12,337
Risking their lives
over rumors and dreams.

291
00:26:12,403 --> 00:26:15,842
Rumors and dreams
built this whole world, honey.

292
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,743
Every inch of it.

293
00:26:21,814 --> 00:26:24,016
Wanna know my greatest fear
about dying?

294
00:26:26,018 --> 00:26:27,286
It's being forgotten.

295
00:26:28,988 --> 00:26:32,124
And I can't understand why cuz
I won't be here

296
00:26:32,191 --> 00:26:34,693
to know anyone forgot me.

297
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,628
But the thought is terrifying.

298
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,531
What a silly thing to scare me.

299
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:43,469
Nobody's gonna
forget you, Elsa.

300
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:46,739
And you ain't dying.

301
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,676
You should be dead.

302
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:53,578
But you pay about as much
attention to the rules of nature

303
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:54,780
as you pay to mine.

304
00:26:59,151 --> 00:27:01,086
You look at me like I'm dying.

305
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:04,990
I look at you
for what you are...

306
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,228
The most important thing
to me on this planet.

307
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:12,699
And that comes with
a lot of worry.

308
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:15,867
Because I can't replace you.

309
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:23,910
The others were wrong
not to come with us.

310
00:27:26,112 --> 00:27:27,680
You think they'll make it
to Oregon?

311
00:27:29,949 --> 00:27:31,789
I don't think they'll make it
out of Wyoming.

312
00:27:37,189 --> 00:27:38,189
Me neither.

313
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:48,534
We never spoke of dreams
or death again.

314
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:52,704
Never spoke
of the Pioneers either.

315
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:54,472
Because there was no need.

316
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,340
Come on! Let's go!

317
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:52,198
To survive the frontier,
you must learn to recognize

318
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:54,465
those who won't.

319
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:58,369
And be weary
of their doomed decisions.

320
00:28:58,436 --> 00:29:02,307
They are to be avoided at all
costs, because their fear

321
00:29:02,374 --> 00:29:04,977
is tragedy's closest cousin.

322
00:29:05,044 --> 00:29:07,980
And tragedy is contagious
in this place.

323
00:30:29,862 --> 00:30:32,097
- Shea!
- Hold up here.

324
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,163
Get ready.

325
00:30:37,469 --> 00:30:38,569
In the foot locker!

326
00:31:06,632 --> 00:31:08,034
She's hurt.

327
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:12,403
- I know. Shot.
Lakota arrow.

328
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:15,707
They been making war?

329
00:31:15,773 --> 00:31:17,576
Somebody made war on them.

330
00:31:17,643 --> 00:31:19,778
They thought it was us.

331
00:31:19,845 --> 00:31:22,513
What do your, uh, doctors say?

332
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,182
We have no doctors.

333
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:26,751
I'll get you a doctor.

334
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:35,326
We need to put her in the creek.

335
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:36,827
It's too cold.

336
00:31:36,894 --> 00:31:39,530
She's got a fever.

337
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:41,968
Cold is what she needs.

338
00:31:42,034 --> 00:31:43,368
Stop the bleeding.

339
00:31:58,183 --> 00:32:00,451
That was quite the battle, huh?

340
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:01,953
Was a good one.

341
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:07,692
You her father?

342
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:08,826
I can call him.

343
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:12,130
Call him.

344
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,969
You are her father.

345
00:36:11,036 --> 00:36:13,137
I am.

346
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:15,306
What do you know of war?

347
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:19,311
More than I care to.

348
00:36:19,378 --> 00:36:20,945
Mm.

349
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:25,684
You know that the
Lakota, they dip their arrows

350
00:36:25,751 --> 00:36:29,655
in manure, so a hit is fatal.

351
00:36:31,257 --> 00:36:34,125
And an arrow in the liver
is for certain.

352
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:38,096
I know what's coming.

353
00:36:38,163 --> 00:36:39,898
I just...

354
00:36:39,965 --> 00:36:41,900
Where we put her in the ground
is where we stay.

355
00:36:41,967 --> 00:36:44,235
And I gotta find
that place fast.

356
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:47,639
Otherwise I'm living out here
in the sagebrush with you.

357
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:54,813
I know a place for you.

358
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,617
You go through that pass then
you follow the river south.

359
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:04,789
I used to hunt that valley
as a boy.

360
00:37:06,592 --> 00:37:09,827
The winters are cruel,

361
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:15,867
but the summer's are rich
and a man who plans can thrive.

362
00:37:15,934 --> 00:37:18,168
And you look like a man
who plans.

363
00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:22,608
What's the valley called.

364
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:29,114
I don't know the word in your
language, but it's, uh...

365
00:37:29,179 --> 00:37:32,684
When you die, you go there.

366
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:33,751
Heaven.

367
00:37:36,288 --> 00:37:39,023
No, there's
another word, it's not...

368
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:44,362
Paradise.

369
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:51,202
Yes, Paradise. Good name.

370
00:37:51,268 --> 00:37:57,141
But know this:
that in seven generations

371
00:37:57,208 --> 00:38:00,746
my people will rise up,
and take it back from you.

372
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:03,081
In seven generations
you can have it.

373
00:38:03,148 --> 00:38:04,148
Mm.

374
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,422
How long's the trip?

375
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:13,692
Spotted Eagle: Depends
how fast you ride.

376
00:38:13,759 --> 00:38:18,797
But with that wagon,
it will take a week.

377
00:38:18,864 --> 00:38:21,032
And she doesn't have that.

378
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:29,608
Some day my family
might seek to hunt that valley

379
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:36,914
and if they do, you remember me.

380
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:37,983
And you let them.

381
00:38:40,085 --> 00:38:41,662
Your family can hunt
the day I get there

382
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:43,021
and every day after.

383
00:38:43,088 --> 00:38:45,590
Mm. Good.

384
00:39:03,173 --> 00:39:04,173
Feel better?

385
00:39:09,947 --> 00:39:11,617
You lied.

386
00:39:16,722 --> 00:39:17,722
I'm sorry.

387
00:39:23,795 --> 00:39:25,963
I'm dying.

388
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,965
I know, honey.

389
00:39:45,817 --> 00:39:47,251
Make me a promise.

390
00:39:49,054 --> 00:39:50,054
Anything.

391
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:55,760
- Let me choose the spot.
Please?

392
00:39:57,929 --> 00:39:58,929
Yeah, honey.

393
00:40:04,202 --> 00:40:05,637
You choose the spot.

394
00:40:48,445 --> 00:40:52,349
They're fine. Ate good.

395
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:55,554
Went right to sleep.

396
00:40:55,621 --> 00:40:59,324
They haven't spoken since
their father died...

397
00:40:59,389 --> 00:41:00,525
in Texas.

398
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,730
I couldn't get them
to shut up.

399
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:10,101
They talk to you?

400
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:12,704
All the time.

401
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:20,711
Ask about what's this sound
and this animal...

402
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:25,884
What's Oregon like...

403
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,554
They won't talk to me.

404
00:41:29,621 --> 00:41:30,621
For months.

405
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:33,791
Guess I'd blame me too.

406
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:35,159
Ain't blame.

407
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:39,496
They just don't know
what to say.

408
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:44,001
After all they seen you
go through.

409
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:50,108
It's the journey that keeps them
from talking with you.

410
00:41:52,777 --> 00:41:58,949
To them, you're this,
this giant egg...

411
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,985
They're terrified
is gonna break.

412
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:07,025
They talk to me cuz

413
00:42:07,092 --> 00:42:08,893
they couldn't care less
if I break.

414
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,130
And that's fine.

415
00:42:16,601 --> 00:42:18,637
Guess I don't care
too much myself.

416
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:24,208
What happens in Oregon?

417
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:26,443
Don't know a thing
about Oregon.

418
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:29,514
With us, I mean.

419
00:42:31,481 --> 00:42:35,920
Figure we find
a valley with, uh...

420
00:42:35,987 --> 00:42:38,724
some good water

421
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:39,990
no people.

422
00:42:42,793 --> 00:42:45,731
Then we stake it out
and make it ours.

423
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,135
And your boys
will talk to you again.

424
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,041
Cuz the journey's over.

425
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:26,003
I've lost a daughter too.

426
00:43:31,643 --> 00:43:33,679
Time will come
when you blame yourself.

427
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:37,547
Think it's your fault.

428
00:43:39,483 --> 00:43:41,119
For giving her so much rein.

429
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:45,422
And maybe it is your fault...

430
00:43:49,094 --> 00:43:52,030
But I'll say this...

431
00:43:52,097 --> 00:43:55,000
I've watched this girl
for the last six months

432
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:57,268
and she has outlived us all.

433
00:43:59,704 --> 00:44:05,643
I'm 75 years old
and she has out-smiled me,

434
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:11,516
out-loved me, out-fought me...

435
00:44:11,581 --> 00:44:15,619
She's outlived me.

436
00:44:15,686 --> 00:44:17,621
She's out-lived all of us.

437
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:25,931
She wants to pick the spot
where she's buried.

438
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:32,603
She wants to choose it.
Put eyes on it.

439
00:44:37,775 --> 00:44:40,045
These wagons won't make
the trip in time.

440
00:44:43,581 --> 00:44:46,150
My boy can't make the trip
on horseback.

441
00:44:46,217 --> 00:44:48,152
Mm-hm.

442
00:44:48,219 --> 00:44:49,653
And I gave her my word.

443
00:44:49,721 --> 00:44:54,259
I can't let her life end
with me breaking it.

444
00:44:55,994 --> 00:45:01,231
And I have absolutely no idea
how to tell my wife...

445
00:45:01,298 --> 00:45:04,668
I gotta take her daughter
away from her...

446
00:45:04,735 --> 00:45:07,739
To die...

447
00:45:07,806 --> 00:45:09,907
And she can't go.

448
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:15,746
She'll hear the logic
in it from you.

449
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:23,288
From me, all she'll hear
is the cruelty in it.

450
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:30,628
You think you can
do that for me?

451
00:45:33,264 --> 00:45:34,264
Please...

452
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:43,208
Yeah.

453
00:45:43,273 --> 00:45:44,708
I can do that for ya.

454
00:46:15,405 --> 00:46:16,405
Ma'am?

455
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:26,184
So, what is my husband
too scared to ask me?

456
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:33,724
He promised your daughter she
could choose where she dies.

457
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:36,900
And that's where you
build the ranch.

458
00:46:41,266 --> 00:46:43,101
But it's a week's drive
on a wagon.

459
00:46:44,402 --> 00:46:45,469
She ain't got a week.

460
00:46:47,538 --> 00:46:48,974
Horse can make it in two days.

461
00:46:51,675 --> 00:46:53,577
Still haven't heard
a question.

462
00:46:55,380 --> 00:47:01,351
Well, I really don't know
what the question is, ma'am.

463
00:47:05,255 --> 00:47:07,625
I guess the question is,
are you willing to say goodbye

464
00:47:07,692 --> 00:47:08,692
to her here.

465
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:14,599
Men are such fucking cowards.

466
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:30,581
It ain't cowardice, ma'am.

467
00:47:30,648 --> 00:47:33,018
It's a shame that the question's
even being asked.

468
00:47:35,286 --> 00:47:37,655
When do they leave?

469
00:47:37,722 --> 00:47:38,922
Should leave in the morning.

470
00:47:59,344 --> 00:48:00,344
I'm sorry.

471
00:48:04,748 --> 00:48:05,815
Ain't no other way.

472
00:50:02,632 --> 00:50:03,632
I love you.

473
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:05,668
I love you both.

474
00:50:06,737 --> 00:50:07,737
With all my heart.

475
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:10,867
I'll see you
in the valley, mama.

476
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:13,510
See you there.

477
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,268
I hope you prove 'em
all wrong.

478
00:50:37,335 --> 00:50:41,338
Hope you laugh about this
in twenty years.

479
00:50:41,405 --> 00:50:43,673
Laugh at all of us
for doubting you.

480
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:44,942
Well, if I can't...

481
00:50:48,313 --> 00:50:49,813
I'll come meet you on the beach.

482
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:52,416
I'll save you a spot.

483
00:50:57,121 --> 00:50:58,422
We'll be right behind you.

484
00:51:00,925 --> 00:51:02,427
Keep 'em close.

485
00:51:02,492 --> 00:51:03,860
Like they were my own.

486
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:45,496
This way. Here.

487
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:08,351
Stop.

488
00:53:20,898 --> 00:53:22,132
This is the spot.

489
00:53:24,402 --> 00:53:25,442
Where do you want to go?

490
00:53:28,306 --> 00:53:29,373
Against the tree.

491
00:54:15,251 --> 00:54:16,721
Let's just sit here and...

492
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,090
Rest for a bit.

493
00:54:23,793 --> 00:54:24,862
You want a blanket?

494
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:27,764
No.

495
00:54:29,333 --> 00:54:30,635
You be the blanket.

496
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:39,643
What's your first memory?

497
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,416
I was... probably three
I reckon.

498
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:51,088
My daddy had an apprentice.

499
00:54:52,989 --> 00:54:55,059
And he was banging horse shoes.

500
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,262
I remember the sparks.

501
00:55:04,034 --> 00:55:09,106
He looked up at me
and he smiled...

502
00:55:09,172 --> 00:55:13,844
put his hands over his eyes,
and said "peekaboo I see you,"

503
00:55:18,014 --> 00:55:20,951
then he covered his eyes
with his hands,

504
00:55:21,018 --> 00:55:23,286
and he said
you can't see me."

505
00:55:23,353 --> 00:55:24,353
"Where am I."

506
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:29,860
I didn't understand the game,

507
00:55:31,996 --> 00:55:36,266
I mean, he was hiding
behind his hands.

508
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,536
And I could see him.

509
00:55:38,603 --> 00:55:40,036
Plain as day.

510
00:55:44,942 --> 00:55:46,577
And I thought he was a fool.

511
00:55:51,981 --> 00:55:53,050
Mine was...

512
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:00,525
All of these birds...

513
00:56:07,965 --> 00:56:09,500
In the field behind the house.

514
00:56:12,302 --> 00:56:13,971
Right after a rain.

515
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,914
Pecking at the ground.

516
00:56:27,452 --> 00:56:28,952
Pulling out worms.

517
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:35,025
And I thought...

518
00:56:38,262 --> 00:56:44,068
"How smart. Wait for the rain
to soften the earth."

519
00:56:50,574 --> 00:56:52,710
I just thought that
was so smart.

520
00:56:56,614 --> 00:57:00,585
- You were right, honey.
That was smart.

521
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:40,190
You birds sure are smart.

522
00:57:47,597 --> 00:57:48,597
Honey...

523
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:51,969
Honey...

524
00:57:59,342 --> 00:58:01,210
I understand it now.

525
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:04,414
Understand what?

526
00:58:06,215 --> 00:58:07,784
I know what it is.

527
00:58:10,855 --> 00:58:12,456
And I'm not scared.

528
00:58:15,391 --> 00:58:17,161
I'm not scared, daddy.

529
01:00:18,382 --> 01:00:19,382
This is it.

530
01:00:22,585 --> 01:00:24,353
Mama! There's a river!

531
01:00:27,391 --> 01:00:28,826
Is it too far?

532
01:00:28,893 --> 01:00:30,594
Ain't nothing too far for us.

533
01:00:33,262 --> 01:00:35,965
You want the river...

534
01:00:36,032 --> 01:00:37,266
I'll stake you a river.

535
01:01:13,804 --> 01:01:15,204
Just look at that, Helen.

536
01:01:17,206 --> 01:01:18,307
Isn't that beautiful...

537
01:02:14,164 --> 01:02:16,867
There is a moment where
your dreams and your memories

538
01:02:16,934 --> 01:02:20,804
merge together,
and form a perfect world.

539
01:02:22,672 --> 01:02:25,541
That is Heaven.

540
01:02:25,608 --> 01:02:27,911
And each Heaven is unique.

541
01:02:27,978 --> 01:02:29,612
It is the world of you.

542
01:02:34,184 --> 01:02:38,454
The land is filled
with all you hold dear

543
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:40,724
and the sky is your imagination.

544
01:03:09,585 --> 01:03:15,291
My Heaven is filled with good
horses and open plains

545
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:19,295
and wild cattle
and a man who loves me.

546
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:28,637
Race ya.

547
01:03:43,853 --> 01:03:46,155
It is always sunrise
in my world...

548
01:03:48,192 --> 01:03:50,159
And there are no storms.

549
01:03:51,594 --> 01:03:53,163
I am the only lighting.

550
01:04:03,139 --> 01:04:04,307
I know death now.

551
01:04:06,643 --> 01:04:07,643
I've seen it.

552
01:04:09,378 --> 01:04:10,780
It had no fangs.

553
01:04:12,681 --> 01:04:14,018
It smiled at me.

554
01:04:16,786 --> 01:04:18,889
And it was beautiful.
