Did you have fun, mama?

367
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:36,008
- Yeah, a real hoot, son.

368
00:29:37,476 --> 00:29:38,710
Close your eyes, son.

This is harder than you

everything we had and then some.

Come on, cows.

We need to lighten these wagons.

You are sending him to Oregon

he unloads his wagon.

00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:50,040
Whoop, whoop, whoop.

544
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:52,042
[whistling]

545
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:55,546
- Get up, cow, get up.
Come on. Come on.

546
00:51:58,583 --> 00:51:59,517
Come on! Hey!

547
00:51:59,584 --> 00:52:00,551
- Hut, hut!
- Woop!

548
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:01,586
- Get up, cow.

549
00:52:01,652 --> 00:52:04,121
[shouting, whooping]

550
00:52:04,189 --> 00:52:07,192
Hey, cow!

551
00:52:58,643 --> 00:53:01,812
- I had abandoned every
memory of Tennessee,

552
00:53:01,879 --> 00:53:04,382
as though I was born
on this journey.

553
00:53:04,449 --> 00:53:05,950
But I wasn't...

554
00:53:08,586 --> 00:53:12,257
We were leaving a place
and seeking another.

555
00:53:12,323 --> 00:53:15,226
And the journey was
the necessary,

556
00:53:15,293 --> 00:53:17,395
miserable road
between the two.

557
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:25,770
Somehow I felt immune to
the dangers of this place.

558
00:53:27,071 --> 00:53:28,973
As if the land and
I had struck a deal.

559
00:53:30,975 --> 00:53:34,211
I could pass unharmed
so long as I loved it.

560
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,348
And I did.

561
00:53:37,415 --> 00:53:39,484
I loved everything about it.

562
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:45,923
But crossing the Brazos
taught me there was no deal.

563
00:53:47,692 --> 00:53:51,262
No matter how much we love it,

564
00:53:51,329 --> 00:53:54,765
the land will
never love us back.

565
00:53:55,933 --> 00:53:57,568
