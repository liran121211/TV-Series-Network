1
00:00:53,662 --> 00:00:55,229
I told you not to teach her.

2
00:00:56,621 --> 00:00:57,840
I didn't teach her nuthin'.

3
00:00:59,537 --> 00:01:02,062
This was
our third day here.

4
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:03,628
The longest we'd stayed
in one place

5
00:01:03,715 --> 00:01:04,803
since the journey started.

6
00:01:06,588 --> 00:01:10,418
One trait all animals
share, people included:

7
00:01:10,505 --> 00:01:13,290
no matter where we are
or where we wish to be,

8
00:01:13,377 --> 00:01:15,814
if we're there
longer than a day,

9
00:01:15,901 --> 00:01:18,034
we try to make a home of it.

10
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:20,776
But the Plains
are not for home building,

11
00:01:20,863 --> 00:01:22,343
not enough resources.

12
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,996
No shelter...

13
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:27,957
The Plains are for
the vagabonds, wanderers,

14
00:01:28,044 --> 00:01:29,176
and cowboys.

15
00:01:29,263 --> 00:01:31,003
Their home is a saddle.

16
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,005
The sky is their roof.

17
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,356
The ground is their bed.

18
00:01:35,443 --> 00:01:37,923
What they lack
in material comfort

19
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,970
is regained in the knowledge
that they are always home.

20
00:01:41,057 --> 00:01:45,322
To them the journey
is the destination.

21
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:48,804
Should they find gold
at the end of the rainbow,

22
00:01:48,891 --> 00:01:50,588
they would leave
it there and seek another,

23
00:01:50,675 --> 00:01:53,243
choosing freedom
over the burden of the pot.

24
00:01:56,986 --> 00:01:59,945
I haven't thought
once of Oregon.

25
00:02:00,032 --> 00:02:03,123
No dreams of the ocean
or snow covered mountains.

26
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,690
I only dream of the journey.

27
00:02:05,777 --> 00:02:07,170
That is all.

28
00:02:07,257 --> 00:02:08,998
No gold for me.

29
00:02:09,085 --> 00:02:11,435
Just the rainbow.

30
00:02:11,522 --> 00:02:13,350
You ready?

31
00:02:13,437 --> 00:02:14,569
Yes sir.

32
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,289
Well, joined up
with some mustangs, I see.

33
00:02:39,376 --> 00:02:41,857
Mustangs are tricky to herd.

34
00:02:41,944 --> 00:02:43,902
This is your world, Sam.
What do you think?

35
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:46,688
I think we run
the trick out of them.

36
00:02:46,775 --> 00:02:48,603
Carve out that stallion
and get him caught.

37
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,779
They'll follow us
to camp like sheep.

38
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,280
Get up against it
on the other side!

39
00:04:01,502 --> 00:04:02,503
Push in on it.

40
00:04:04,374 --> 00:04:05,680
Whoop at him to keep him moving.

41
00:04:05,767 --> 00:04:06,898
Whoop at him?

42
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,898
Girl's starting
to ride like a Comanche.

43
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:26,135
That is a compliment, James.

44
00:05:53,831 --> 00:05:55,703
Hup!

45
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,182
Hey!
Come on!

46
00:06:01,578 --> 00:06:03,580
Ya! Hyah!

47
00:06:06,714 --> 00:06:07,714
Hup!

48
00:06:10,544 --> 00:06:13,634
Hyup! Hyup!

49
00:06:15,113 --> 00:06:16,854
Ya! Hyup!

50
00:06:29,476 --> 00:06:31,956
Hyup! Hyup!

51
00:06:45,579 --> 00:06:47,407
Now you know
how to steal horses.

52
00:06:47,494 --> 00:06:49,844
Hm. Could come
in handy some day.

53
00:06:49,931 --> 00:06:52,237
If you stick with me it will.

54
00:07:00,071 --> 00:07:02,291
Ow... Damn.

55
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:14,999
Yeah, ha ha.

56
00:07:15,086 --> 00:07:16,966
He says you ride too good
for white man pants.

57
00:07:20,135 --> 00:07:21,528
He's right.

58
00:07:43,767 --> 00:07:44,855
Thigh tore out.

59
00:07:47,597 --> 00:07:49,425
You have another dress.

60
00:07:49,512 --> 00:07:50,818
I'd rather wear a bean sack

61
00:07:50,905 --> 00:07:52,185
than be choked
by a damned dress.

62
00:07:57,738 --> 00:07:59,914
It should be double stitched.

63
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:02,133
Let me see it.
Let me see it.

64
00:08:14,711 --> 00:08:18,062
I hear things are bad
around Laramie.

65
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:20,587
Yep.

66
00:08:20,674 --> 00:08:23,111
Well, the Arapaho and the Lakota
are pretty fed up

67
00:08:23,198 --> 00:08:24,828
with the thieves
and the government's lies

68
00:08:24,852 --> 00:08:26,172
taking matters
in their own hands.

69
00:08:27,637 --> 00:08:29,073
Who can blame 'em?

70
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,380
They won't be
your worry, though.

71
00:08:31,467 --> 00:08:32,381
The winter is your worry,

72
00:08:32,468 --> 00:08:34,731
and with all those folks afoot,

73
00:08:34,818 --> 00:08:36,258
winter's when you're
passing through.

74
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:41,390
Well... It's too much.

75
00:08:43,044 --> 00:08:45,742
I think I ought
to take them to Denver.

76
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:47,744
Denver would be wise.

77
00:08:49,485 --> 00:08:50,485
Let's tend to the horses.

78
00:08:52,619 --> 00:08:53,899
Where they go ain't up to you.

79
00:08:55,491 --> 00:08:57,711
You even ask
them what they want?

80
00:08:57,798 --> 00:08:59,321
Want ain't got
nuthin to do with it.

81
00:08:59,408 --> 00:09:00,583
They won't survive.

82
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,846
Then they don't survive.

83
00:09:02,933 --> 00:09:04,718
That's their choice.
It ain't yours.

84
00:09:06,328 --> 00:09:08,069
You're going anyway.

85
00:09:08,156 --> 00:09:09,461
I don't know where I'm going.

86
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,202
But I ain't going to Denver.

87
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:13,161
And I sure as hell
ain't going back.

88
00:09:16,947 --> 00:09:19,123
Do you want to go to Denver?

89
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:22,997
I haven't factored
what I want into this once.

90
00:09:23,084 --> 00:09:25,565
There is a map
in your father's mind,

91
00:09:25,652 --> 00:09:28,219
and no one's gonna stop him
from following it.

92
00:09:28,306 --> 00:09:30,918
No sense in trying.

93
00:09:31,005 --> 00:09:32,702
He said to trust him.
I'm trusting him.

94
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,705
Do you trust him?

95
00:09:37,272 --> 00:09:39,491
Know why he lets you
run wild, don't you?

96
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,189
'Cause he trusts me, too.

97
00:09:44,018 --> 00:09:46,368
'Cause he knows dresses
is your future.

98
00:09:46,455 --> 00:09:51,242
No matter where we go,
you're wearing dresses.

99
00:09:51,329 --> 00:09:53,549
And raising babies,
and sweating over a garden,

100
00:09:55,551 --> 00:10:00,904
and swallowing every dream
you've ever had,

101
00:10:00,991 --> 00:10:03,994
because that's all the world
wants from you.

102
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:06,059
He may find some place where
we can hold the world off

103
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,564
for a while, but it'll
find us there too,

104
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:09,971
and bring all their rules
with it.

105
00:10:23,492 --> 00:10:26,060
Indians!
Indians!

106
00:10:32,196 --> 00:10:33,850
Put your rifles down!

107
00:10:34,677 --> 00:10:35,765
Put 'em down!

108
00:10:42,337 --> 00:10:43,904
Now that's not very friendly.

109
00:10:43,991 --> 00:10:45,514
We don't know they're friends.

110
00:10:45,601 --> 00:10:48,517
If they weren't our friends,
we'd already be dead.

111
00:10:48,604 --> 00:10:52,260
We asked them to come.
They're here to trade.

112
00:10:52,347 --> 00:10:54,218
No matter which way
we go we need provisions.

113
00:10:58,483 --> 00:11:00,834
Wait. Wait!

114
00:11:00,921 --> 00:11:02,226
Are we going
somewhere different?

115
00:11:57,673 --> 00:11:59,719
She will help you
with rip in pants.

116
00:12:01,895 --> 00:12:03,766
They're fixed.

117
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,244
Thank you.
Mm-hm.

118
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:56,471
Good.

119
00:13:05,219 --> 00:13:07,743
What's that?

120
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,876
That's not for sale.

121
00:13:11,094 --> 00:13:12,095
What is it?

122
00:13:14,576 --> 00:13:16,056
From the Spanish.

123
00:13:18,623 --> 00:13:20,321
You know, they tried
to take our land too.

124
00:13:24,499 --> 00:13:26,936
I ain't taking nuthin',
I'm just passing through.

125
00:13:27,023 --> 00:13:28,111
Our land cannot be taken.

126
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,680
White man thinks he took it.

127
00:13:31,767 --> 00:13:33,595
White man is like the wolf.

128
00:13:33,682 --> 00:13:37,686
He kills everything
until only the wolves are left,

129
00:13:37,773 --> 00:13:39,053
then the wolves kill each other.

130
00:13:40,341 --> 00:13:42,212
Then there is nothing.

131
00:13:42,299 --> 00:13:44,127
And the land is free again.

132
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,610
That sounds about right.

133
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:07,759
Come up from the west
now heading north.

134
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,066
Got a good look
at the Comanche camp,

135
00:14:10,153 --> 00:14:11,633
decided easy pickins
weren't so easy.

136
00:14:14,505 --> 00:14:15,637
I'll follow 'em.

137
00:14:15,724 --> 00:14:18,031
You get those people out
of here, Shea.

138
00:14:18,118 --> 00:14:20,033
No matter where you take 'em.

139
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,208
Thank you.

140
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,690
Come across any
barbed wire yet?

141
00:14:25,777 --> 00:14:27,214
Never heard of it.

142
00:14:29,607 --> 00:14:33,046
It's twisted steel wire
with little barbs woven into it.

143
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:34,569
Sharp as a knife's tip.

144
00:14:34,656 --> 00:14:38,616
It is the one fence cattle
will not push through.

145
00:14:38,703 --> 00:14:40,812
They're going to carve this
country into little rectangles.

146
00:14:40,836 --> 00:14:41,836
Then fence them off.

147
00:14:43,752 --> 00:14:45,580
And just like that,

148
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:48,278
two of our great
pleasures are gone.

149
00:14:48,365 --> 00:14:50,585
Next time I see you
I hope it's in a saloon

150
00:14:50,672 --> 00:14:51,891
and not a gunfight.

151
00:14:53,631 --> 00:14:55,827
If you see me in a saloon,
I followed a cattle thief in it,

152
00:14:55,851 --> 00:14:57,897
a there will damn sure
be a gunfight,

153
00:14:57,984 --> 00:14:59,942
or a hanging, one of the two.

154
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:01,465
Church picnic then, maybe.

155
00:15:03,772 --> 00:15:06,601
When we meet again,
it will be on a trail,

156
00:15:06,688 --> 00:15:08,690
if there's one left.

157
00:15:08,777 --> 00:15:11,301
I think this is my
last trail, Charlie.

158
00:15:14,696 --> 00:15:16,096
Well, then, I guess
this is adios.

159
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:19,527
Adios, my friend.

160
00:16:04,485 --> 00:16:05,485
Ow.

161
00:16:13,276 --> 00:16:16,845
They must be tight.
They will stretch.

162
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:29,379
What is she saying?

163
00:16:29,466 --> 00:16:31,686
I ask why you wear clothes
like a horseman.

164
00:16:31,773 --> 00:16:33,209
She says you are one.

165
00:16:33,296 --> 00:16:35,216
But you are a white woman,
so I don't understand.

166
00:16:36,821 --> 00:16:37,909
No more rip.

167
00:16:43,872 --> 00:16:46,005
He already pay.

168
00:16:48,616 --> 00:16:49,704
Thank you.

169
00:17:01,846 --> 00:17:03,674
Got her some chaps.

170
00:17:05,154 --> 00:17:06,416
It's official.

171
00:17:06,503 --> 00:17:07,635
You're all cowboy now.

172
00:17:49,981 --> 00:17:53,246
I have no home.

173
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:57,163
Which is to say,
my home is everywhere.

174
00:18:08,174 --> 00:18:09,214
I need you to translate.

175
00:18:15,442 --> 00:18:18,053
We've got eight wagons
to make the trip.

176
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:21,274
To accommodate your belongings,

177
00:18:21,361 --> 00:18:25,669
only the very young
and old can ride in the wagons.

178
00:18:25,756 --> 00:18:29,456
The rest of you must walk
or sit a horse.

179
00:18:29,543 --> 00:18:32,067
And if you don't
know how to ride,

180
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:33,721
this ain't the place to learn.

181
00:18:33,808 --> 00:18:37,377
If we're lucky,
and we haven't been yet,

182
00:18:37,464 --> 00:18:39,640
we'll reach Fort Laramie
in October.

183
00:18:39,727 --> 00:18:42,817
That means crossing
South Pass in the snow

184
00:18:42,904 --> 00:18:44,949
or staying
the winter at the fort.

185
00:18:45,036 --> 00:18:46,386
Neither are safe.

186
00:18:48,475 --> 00:18:49,475
Another option is...

187
00:18:50,607 --> 00:18:52,696
We head to Denver.

188
00:18:52,783 --> 00:18:54,655
We can be there in six weeks.

189
00:18:54,742 --> 00:18:57,527
There's a lot of good land
in those valleys.

190
00:18:57,614 --> 00:18:59,007
It's a good place to call home.

191
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,531
No Oregon?

192
00:19:04,317 --> 00:19:06,275
When was this decided?

193
00:19:06,362 --> 00:19:09,278
It wasn't.
Not by me.

194
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,456
We ain't stopping.

195
00:19:31,953 --> 00:19:33,824
The land in Denver is free?

196
00:19:34,825 --> 00:19:36,218
It is not.

197
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:41,180
Then we are maids and miners

198
00:19:41,267 --> 00:19:42,267
the same we were at home.

199
00:19:42,311 --> 00:19:43,311
But you're alive.

200
00:19:45,445 --> 00:19:48,143
If you want to push on,
we'll push on in the spring.

201
00:19:50,885 --> 00:19:52,713
I'm heading north.

202
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,760
Anyone wants to ride
with me is welcome.

203
00:19:56,847 --> 00:20:00,808
A good remuda of horses
and plenty of beef,

204
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:04,333
and I can't think of a better
place to learn to ride.

205
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,423
You come with me, I ain't
gonna baby you like he did.

206
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,036
You're gonna work
and you're gonna keep up,

207
00:20:12,123 --> 00:20:14,561
'cause I ain't crossing
the mountains in the snow

208
00:20:14,648 --> 00:20:16,171
and I ain't winterin'
at no fort.

209
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,840
You're gonna
get 'em all killed.

210
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:23,047
Well, people die
in Denver, too.

211
00:20:23,134 --> 00:20:25,093
It's their choice.

212
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,617
The question is:

213
00:20:27,704 --> 00:20:29,445
what are you going to do
when they make it?

214
00:20:35,538 --> 00:20:36,974
What's it gonna be?

215
00:20:43,459 --> 00:20:44,459
We go with you.

216
00:20:47,811 --> 00:20:49,204
We head out in the morning.

217
00:20:50,336 --> 00:20:51,380
Come ready.

218
00:21:02,043 --> 00:21:03,392
I don't want to leave.

219
00:21:08,005 --> 00:21:09,005
You want to stay.

220
00:21:11,661 --> 00:21:13,054
I don't need to see mountains.

221
00:21:17,754 --> 00:21:19,408
Mountains are worth seeing.

222
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:22,324
You saying I should go?

223
00:21:24,631 --> 00:21:26,328
I'm saying mountains
are worth seeing.

224
00:21:32,769 --> 00:21:35,468
But you don't need wagons
to see them.

225
00:21:35,555 --> 00:21:36,556
I can take you.

226
00:21:44,955 --> 00:21:45,955
It's settled.

227
00:21:47,218 --> 00:21:48,263
You'll take me then.

228
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,320
Where are you going?

229
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,590
I must offer
your father something.

230
00:22:10,503 --> 00:22:11,504
For what?

231
00:22:12,853 --> 00:22:13,854
For you.

232
00:22:53,763 --> 00:22:54,763
Buffalo.

233
00:23:07,908 --> 00:23:11,346
Everywhere you go,
a blessing follows.

234
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:17,439
You know how to steal horses.

235
00:23:17,526 --> 00:23:20,268
Now I teach you to hunt..

236
00:23:21,487 --> 00:23:22,727
Lightning with the Yellow Hair.

237
00:23:45,293 --> 00:23:47,338
Up to his shoulders!

238
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:48,426
Shoot behind his ears!

239
00:24:32,601 --> 00:24:34,298
Hoh...

240
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,439
Eat.

241
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:49,096
Bite into it.

242
00:24:49,183 --> 00:24:50,576
His strength is your strength.

243
00:25:14,774 --> 00:25:16,732
Lightning with the Yellow Hair.

244
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,995
Horse thief and hunter.

245
00:26:18,185 --> 00:26:20,535
What have you done?

246
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:21,622
I killed a buffalo.

247
00:26:43,036 --> 00:26:45,168
You packed up?

248
00:26:45,255 --> 00:26:46,909
No, Captain.

249
00:26:46,996 --> 00:26:49,520
Better get to it.

250
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:50,652
Ain't gonna do it.

251
00:26:51,827 --> 00:26:53,655
I promised I'd see her to Oregon

252
00:26:55,788 --> 00:26:56,948
and that's what I'm gonna do.

253
00:27:00,706 --> 00:27:04,927
Well, free country.

254
00:27:05,014 --> 00:27:08,061
It's gonna be hard enough
with you,

255
00:27:08,148 --> 00:27:09,715
but we ain't got
no chance without you.

256
00:27:12,065 --> 00:27:15,459
I ain't ever
asked you for nothing

257
00:27:15,546 --> 00:27:17,548
but I'm asking you now.

258
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:18,898
Don't leave us, Captain.

259
00:27:21,901 --> 00:27:23,206
Where you going?

260
00:27:27,167 --> 00:27:29,473
What happened to you.

261
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,954
I killed a buffalo.

262
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:33,521
We ate its heart
to keep its strength.

263
00:27:35,436 --> 00:27:36,567
Where you going?

264
00:27:38,221 --> 00:27:39,221
Oregon, honey.

265
00:27:41,224 --> 00:27:42,225
With you.

266
00:27:44,488 --> 00:27:46,752
I'm not going to Oregon.

267
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:47,927
I'm staying here.

268
00:27:55,543 --> 00:27:56,823
What time we pull out?

269
00:27:58,807 --> 00:28:02,115
First light.

270
00:28:02,202 --> 00:28:04,683
No more crack
of 9 am for this outfit.

271
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:07,990
New sheriff in town ain't
gonna take it anymore, huh.

272
00:28:08,077 --> 00:28:09,557
Not if we're
gonna beat winter.

273
00:28:12,952 --> 00:28:14,518
Let's talk
about your daughter.

274
00:28:14,605 --> 00:28:18,044
Uh oh, she's mine again.

275
00:28:18,131 --> 00:28:19,915
What did she do?

276
00:28:20,002 --> 00:28:24,093
Ran off with that
Comanche boy, killed a buffalo.

277
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:27,009
Mm-hmm. Came back, her
face covered in blood

278
00:28:27,096 --> 00:28:28,976
'cause I guess they ate half
of it in the field.

279
00:28:32,536 --> 00:28:36,410
Go ahead and laugh.
She is feral.

280
00:28:36,497 --> 00:28:38,377
You always talked
about how you'd raise our boys

281
00:28:38,412 --> 00:28:41,197
to be men
and you started with her.

282
00:28:41,284 --> 00:28:43,330
When we get back
to any form of civilization

283
00:28:43,417 --> 00:28:45,245
I'm gonna have to undo
all of that.

284
00:28:45,332 --> 00:28:46,855
Do you really want to?

285
00:28:46,942 --> 00:28:48,727
Oh, please.
James...

286
00:28:48,814 --> 00:28:50,380
Let me deal with one
dreamer at a time.

287
00:28:53,644 --> 00:28:57,039
You're a dreamer, too.

288
00:28:57,126 --> 00:28:58,824
You wouldn't be with me
if you weren't.

289
00:28:58,911 --> 00:29:00,869
I'm a believer, honey.
There's a difference.

290
00:29:02,915 --> 00:29:04,830
Fair enough.

291
00:29:18,452 --> 00:29:19,452
What is this?

292
00:29:19,496 --> 00:29:21,237
It's for you.

293
00:29:21,324 --> 00:29:22,848
Why is it for me?

294
00:29:26,155 --> 00:29:28,723
Whatcha doin'?

295
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,769
I'm trading these things.

296
00:29:30,856 --> 00:29:33,293
Got no use for 'em anymore.

297
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:36,252
Elsa.

298
00:29:36,339 --> 00:29:39,865
Stay in here.
You don't want to see this.

299
00:29:52,573 --> 00:29:53,973
Are you aware
of what he's asking?

300
00:29:55,402 --> 00:29:56,402
I'm aware.

301
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,148
Take the horse, daddy.

302
00:30:02,235 --> 00:30:03,635
Young lady,
I will not allow this.

303
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:09,808
You're not allowing it?

304
00:30:09,895 --> 00:30:11,897
I'm eighteen years old.

305
00:30:11,984 --> 00:30:14,551
I'm allowing it.

306
00:30:14,638 --> 00:30:16,292
You think being
18 makes you a woman?

307
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:18,816
Law thinks it does.

308
00:30:37,139 --> 00:30:38,837
Don't just stand there.
Stop him.

309
00:30:41,317 --> 00:30:42,536
Shoot him.

310
00:30:46,496 --> 00:30:48,063
Do something!

311
00:31:08,431 --> 00:31:10,433
I understood
my mother's worry.

312
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,132
My choices make no sense
in her world,

313
00:31:13,219 --> 00:31:17,745
where customs and prejudice
rule, where law cannot reach.

314
00:31:17,832 --> 00:31:21,618
There will be customs and
prejudice here too, I'm sure.

315
00:31:21,705 --> 00:31:25,535
But they were born
of this world and belong in it.

316
00:31:25,622 --> 00:31:29,104
To import the traditions
of the place you fled,

317
00:31:29,191 --> 00:31:31,541
the place that failed you,

318
00:31:31,628 --> 00:31:35,328
is to condemn the place you
seek with the same failures.

319
00:31:47,035 --> 00:31:48,994
We saw your daughter.

320
00:31:49,081 --> 00:31:51,213
Cookie thought you might want
a swig or two of this.

321
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:59,265
I guess she's gonna
fall in love with every man

322
00:31:59,352 --> 00:32:00,744
she meets till
one of them sticks.

323
00:32:07,838 --> 00:32:11,059
Hell, I don't know.

324
00:32:11,146 --> 00:32:13,148
After a night or two
without you,

325
00:32:13,235 --> 00:32:15,237
I bet she'll point that
fast horse north

326
00:32:15,324 --> 00:32:17,892
and catch us
before we leave Kansas.

327
00:32:17,979 --> 00:32:19,139
You don't know my daughter.

328
00:32:23,593 --> 00:32:25,334
So, no Denver for you.

329
00:32:25,421 --> 00:32:27,554
These folks don't
trust me anymore.

330
00:32:27,641 --> 00:32:29,686
And I don't
trust them for making

331
00:32:29,773 --> 00:32:31,775
a right choice for themselves.

332
00:32:31,862 --> 00:32:34,517
Can't lead people I don't trust.

333
00:32:34,604 --> 00:32:35,997
But you trust them.

334
00:32:36,084 --> 00:32:37,868
They came a long way.

335
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,479
I trust their desire
to see it through.

336
00:32:41,437 --> 00:32:43,613
I'm gonna trust you.

337
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,441
I think I can live with that.

338
00:32:45,528 --> 00:32:48,053
But you're gonna
have to lead 'em.

339
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,403
I'll guide 'em and I'll
protect 'em, but you lead them.

340
00:32:52,361 --> 00:32:53,361
I can do that.

341
00:32:55,321 --> 00:32:56,561
I'm gonna leave that with you.

342
00:32:56,626 --> 00:32:57,932
Hell, no.

343
00:32:58,019 --> 00:32:59,673
I'm liable to crawl in
the son of a bitch

344
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,849
trying to figure out
what to do with that girl.

345
00:33:01,936 --> 00:33:04,808
It's looking like you might
have to trust her too, James.

346
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,993
I barely recognize you.

347
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:02,910
Barely recognize me either.

348
00:34:02,997 --> 00:34:04,129
And I'm happier for it.

349
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,580
What's the worst that
could happen to me, mama?

350
00:34:08,655 --> 00:34:10,613
Mark my words,
you will get hurt.

351
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,460
How many dead lovers
have you laid against?

352
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,792
I've been plenty hurt.

353
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:17,446
Don't talk to me about love.

354
00:34:17,533 --> 00:34:19,579
You barely understand
the concept.

355
00:34:19,666 --> 00:34:22,321
I worked a sharecropper
farm for three years,

356
00:34:22,408 --> 00:34:25,715
pregnant with you, while your
father lay rotting

357
00:34:25,802 --> 00:34:27,065
in a war prison.

358
00:34:27,152 --> 00:34:29,241
And how old were you then?
Seventeen.

359
00:34:29,328 --> 00:34:30,609
Somehow you knew
love at my age,

360
00:34:30,633 --> 00:34:32,374
but I don't
understand the concept.

361
00:34:32,461 --> 00:34:34,942
It's different.
It's not different.

362
00:34:35,029 --> 00:34:36,813
It's exactly the same.

363
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,598
Here's the difference.

364
00:34:38,685 --> 00:34:41,775
You are my child.
When you fall down, and you will

365
00:34:41,862 --> 00:34:44,430
it is my duty to pick you up.

366
00:34:44,517 --> 00:34:46,649
I can't do that if
I don't know where you are,

367
00:34:46,736 --> 00:34:48,256
and if I don't know
what you've become.

368
00:34:50,653 --> 00:34:52,177
It's not your duty
anymore, mother.

369
00:34:53,526 --> 00:34:54,570
I love you.

370
00:34:56,311 --> 00:34:57,660
But I'm a woman.

371
00:34:57,747 --> 00:34:58,966
I pick myself up.

372
00:35:03,188 --> 00:35:06,147
I'll ride with you to Oregon,

373
00:35:06,234 --> 00:35:08,714
then I know where to come if I
ever need a place to start over.

374
00:35:11,196 --> 00:35:15,243
Or maybe I'll just visit,
bring your grandchildren.

375
00:35:23,686 --> 00:35:24,686
So, um...

376
00:35:27,299 --> 00:35:28,778
Is there...

377
00:35:28,865 --> 00:35:30,911
Some form of ceremony?

378
00:35:30,998 --> 00:35:32,391
No ceremony.

379
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,920
All I ask, have a ceremony.

380
00:35:42,836 --> 00:35:46,361
Say vows before God...

381
00:35:46,448 --> 00:35:48,189
so this at least has a chance.

382
00:35:48,276 --> 00:35:51,801
He saved my life.

383
00:35:51,888 --> 00:35:54,326
Twice.

384
00:35:54,413 --> 00:35:57,024
Saved your husband's life too.

385
00:35:57,111 --> 00:36:01,724
I don't need to ask
God's permission to love him.

386
00:36:01,811 --> 00:36:03,291
God sent him.

387
00:36:49,772 --> 00:36:50,991
How you doing there?

388
00:36:51,078 --> 00:36:54,342
He goes where he wants.
Not where I say.

389
00:36:54,429 --> 00:36:56,214
Horse goes where you look.

390
00:36:56,301 --> 00:36:57,389
You're looking at his head.

391
00:36:57,476 --> 00:36:59,173
He don't know how to go there.

392
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,305
Look up at the cattle.

393
00:37:04,918 --> 00:37:05,962
There you go.

394
00:37:08,487 --> 00:37:10,402
What if I want to look at you?

395
00:37:10,489 --> 00:37:15,755
You can look anywhere you want
now, he knows where he's going.

396
00:37:15,842 --> 00:37:18,366
You just say he goes
where I look,

397
00:37:18,453 --> 00:37:21,064
now you're saying
I can look anywhere.

398
00:37:21,151 --> 00:37:24,024
'Cause he knows
where he's going.

399
00:37:24,111 --> 00:37:25,286
You make no sense.

400
00:37:29,812 --> 00:37:31,510
Pretty good way to travel, huh?

401
00:37:33,381 --> 00:37:34,381
I'm terrified.

402
00:37:38,168 --> 00:37:40,693
Now that you
got the steering figured,

403
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:44,044
it's time you find yer seat.

404
00:37:44,131 --> 00:37:45,350
How do I find my seat?

405
00:37:45,437 --> 00:37:47,090
Ah!

406
00:37:51,443 --> 00:37:53,488
Stop speaking German.
We're American now.

407
00:37:55,447 --> 00:37:57,579
Is it okay?
The horse?

408
00:38:04,194 --> 00:38:05,848
Your turn next.

409
00:38:05,935 --> 00:38:07,502
No, no, not me.

410
00:38:07,589 --> 00:38:10,157
Yes, you.
You will be a cowboy.

411
00:38:10,244 --> 00:38:13,378
You be the cowboy.
I drive the wagon.

412
00:38:32,135 --> 00:38:35,922
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

413
00:38:36,009 --> 00:38:38,794
You got to keep your
feet off his flanks.

414
00:38:38,881 --> 00:38:40,405
That's like tickling
you under the arm.

415
00:38:40,492 --> 00:38:41,928
You're gonna run
from the tickle.

416
00:38:42,015 --> 00:38:43,146
So will he.

417
00:38:43,233 --> 00:38:44,104
They're learning.

418
00:38:44,191 --> 00:38:46,541
Yeah, I'm watching the lesson.

419
00:38:46,628 --> 00:38:47,934
And it is skunk ugly.

420
00:38:55,811 --> 00:38:58,727
There's good water up here.
Good place to rest.

421
00:38:58,814 --> 00:39:00,294
Good place to break
that stallion.

422
00:39:00,381 --> 00:39:02,688
What the hell's water got
to do with breaking a horse?

423
00:39:02,775 --> 00:39:03,969
I'll show you
when we get there.

424
00:39:03,993 --> 00:39:05,560
Come on.

425
00:39:05,647 --> 00:39:08,520
Come on. Hup, hup, hup.

426
00:39:08,607 --> 00:39:10,565
Lightning
with the Yellow Hair.

427
00:39:10,652 --> 00:39:11,732
You think you can catch me?

428
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:46,296
You're going to cook it?

429
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,256
Naw, I'm gonna
make sandals out of it.

430
00:39:49,343 --> 00:39:51,650
You expect us to eat that?

431
00:39:51,737 --> 00:39:53,652
Don't they got
deer where you're from?

432
00:39:53,739 --> 00:39:55,262
Pigs.

433
00:39:55,349 --> 00:39:57,090
Pigs?

434
00:39:57,177 --> 00:40:01,224
A pig is one of the
nastiest animals on this planet.

435
00:40:01,311 --> 00:40:05,228
You are what you eat
and a pig will eat anything.

436
00:40:05,315 --> 00:40:06,795
Like a raccoon.

437
00:40:06,882 --> 00:40:08,971
What does deer eat?

438
00:40:09,058 --> 00:40:10,625
Grass.

439
00:40:10,712 --> 00:40:12,235
What does deer taste like?

440
00:40:15,674 --> 00:40:19,460
What does deer taste like?

441
00:40:19,547 --> 00:40:21,419
It tastes like this place.

442
00:40:21,506 --> 00:40:24,117
And the grass and the dirt

443
00:40:24,204 --> 00:40:26,772
and the water from the creek
over there all mixed together.

444
00:40:26,859 --> 00:40:29,078
You eat dirt?
So do you.

445
00:40:29,165 --> 00:40:30,732
Every meal.

446
00:40:30,819 --> 00:40:32,459
If you really want me to
bake yer biscuit,

447
00:40:32,517 --> 00:40:37,043
think about this: one
day yer gonna be dirt.

448
00:40:41,613 --> 00:40:44,267
Dirt? When will
they be dirt?

449
00:40:44,354 --> 00:40:47,053
Depends on when they
go in the ground, ma'am.

450
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,184
Don't it?

451
00:40:52,232 --> 00:40:54,152
Hey, not telling them don't
mean it ain't true.

452
00:42:03,564 --> 00:42:05,610
Whoa, whoa.

453
00:42:19,101 --> 00:42:20,668
He's broke now.

454
00:42:23,192 --> 00:42:25,368
Naw, he's a couple weeks
from being broke.

455
00:42:25,455 --> 00:42:27,762
He's broke. Run him.

456
00:42:27,849 --> 00:42:30,049
If you want him to give you
his heart, you must run him.

457
00:43:19,858 --> 00:43:21,729
This place is beautiful.

458
00:43:29,476 --> 00:43:30,756
That's where she gets it from.

459
00:43:33,175 --> 00:43:34,175
Where who gets what?

460
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:36,831
Your sister.

461
00:43:38,528 --> 00:43:39,747
What did she get?

462
00:43:41,053 --> 00:43:42,271
Her spirit.

463
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:45,623
What's a spirit?

464
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:46,830
The thing that drives you.

465
00:43:48,408 --> 00:43:50,149
What drives me?

466
00:43:52,717 --> 00:43:54,022
I don't know yet, honey.

467
00:43:55,328 --> 00:43:56,851
What drives Elsa?

468
00:43:59,462 --> 00:44:00,986
Hmmm... The wind.

469
00:44:04,337 --> 00:44:05,337
Ya!

470
00:44:23,922 --> 00:44:25,053
Strong.

471
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,140
Fast...

472
00:44:27,534 --> 00:44:28,814
A good horse for war,
that one.

473
00:44:33,453 --> 00:44:34,497
Where will she live?

474
00:44:39,328 --> 00:44:41,461
My land is with Quanah Parker.

475
00:44:41,548 --> 00:44:42,984
South of the Wichita Mountains.

476
00:44:43,071 --> 00:44:47,510
I will build her a house
if that's what she wants, but...

477
00:44:47,597 --> 00:44:49,817
I think she would rather
chase bandits with me.

478
00:44:49,904 --> 00:44:50,904
She would.

479
00:44:52,994 --> 00:44:54,909
But she's young.

480
00:44:54,996 --> 00:44:56,650
The young change their minds.

481
00:44:58,565 --> 00:45:00,085
What if she changes
her mind about you?

482
00:45:02,047 --> 00:45:03,788
Then I will bring
her back to you.

483
00:45:03,875 --> 00:45:05,964
How will you find me?

484
00:45:08,096 --> 00:45:09,924
White men think the world
is so big

485
00:45:10,011 --> 00:45:11,883
because you fight against it
when you travel.

486
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:13,623
We move with it.
Like the wolf.

487
00:45:16,322 --> 00:45:17,322
It is small to us.

488
00:45:19,238 --> 00:45:20,238
I will find you.

489
00:45:22,284 --> 00:45:24,809
No chance you'd
want to come to Oregon?

490
00:45:24,896 --> 00:45:26,811
I fought too hard
for what land we have left.

491
00:45:28,987 --> 00:45:30,118
Doubt the fighting's over.

492
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,950
I marry your daughter, but
I still belong to the people

493
00:45:36,037 --> 00:45:37,397
and the people belong
to this land.

494
00:45:40,041 --> 00:45:42,261
We don't dare leave it.

495
00:45:42,348 --> 00:45:44,045
Maybe some day you find
land to belong to,

496
00:45:44,132 --> 00:45:45,438
and you'll know what I mean.

497
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:07,721
I could make her go with us.

498
00:46:07,808 --> 00:46:09,244
How you gonna do that?

499
00:46:09,331 --> 00:46:11,812
If you tie her to
the back of the wagon

500
00:46:11,899 --> 00:46:13,988
she'll just chew
through that damn rope.

501
00:46:16,295 --> 00:46:18,950
She said she'd ride
with us to Oregon

502
00:46:19,037 --> 00:46:20,516
then come back to him
in the spring.

503
00:46:24,172 --> 00:46:25,892
Let's just hope she falls
in love in Oregon.

504
00:46:27,262 --> 00:46:28,786
With the pattern
she's established

505
00:46:28,873 --> 00:46:30,353
she'll fall in love
again by Nebraska.

506
00:46:34,487 --> 00:46:36,141
It's not funny.

507
00:46:36,228 --> 00:46:37,882
You're the one laughing.

508
00:46:40,362 --> 00:46:40,928
You think our daughter
is the only one out here

509
00:46:41,015 --> 00:46:42,321
falling in love?

510
00:46:42,408 --> 00:46:44,048
I bet there's emigrant
kids fooling around

511
00:46:44,105 --> 00:46:45,628
behind every bush
along this creek.

512
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:49,502
Ours just doesn't hide it.

513
00:46:51,417 --> 00:46:53,941
If she loves something
she will hold its hand

514
00:46:54,028 --> 00:46:55,148
in front of the whole world.

515
00:46:58,859 --> 00:47:00,078
She gets that from you.

516
00:47:03,298 --> 00:47:05,083
She gets racing up
that hill from me.

517
00:47:08,913 --> 00:47:10,305
But the way she loves...

518
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,093
she gets that from you.

519
00:47:16,398 --> 00:47:17,835
That's why it scares you so bad.

520
00:47:19,445 --> 00:47:20,489
You're not scared?

521
00:47:23,928 --> 00:47:27,845
My fear is selfish.

522
00:47:31,979 --> 00:47:33,067
I just want to be with her.

523
00:47:37,332 --> 00:47:38,768
Yeah.

524
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:40,296
Know her children
when she has 'em.

525
00:47:44,209 --> 00:47:46,254
But I...

526
00:47:46,341 --> 00:47:47,821
can't alter the course
of her life

527
00:47:50,519 --> 00:47:52,199
just because of how bad
I'm gonna miss her.

528
00:47:53,827 --> 00:47:54,872
She'll change her mind.

529
00:48:07,014 --> 00:48:09,582
How do you say "I love you?"

530
00:48:13,455 --> 00:48:15,893
Kah-Muk-Kun-Tun Nuh.

531
00:48:16,937 --> 00:48:18,286
Kah...

532
00:48:18,373 --> 00:48:21,463
Kah-Mah-Kun-Tun Nuh.
Kah-Mah-Kun-Tun Nuh.

533
00:48:24,771 --> 00:48:25,772
Pretty good.

534
00:48:27,208 --> 00:48:28,470
How do you say my name?

535
00:48:35,347 --> 00:48:38,524
Lightning with
the Yellow Hair...

536
00:48:52,364 --> 00:48:53,539
Teach me more.

537
00:49:07,161 --> 00:49:08,162
Eere.

538
00:49:11,426 --> 00:49:12,426
Huku.

539
00:49:15,082 --> 00:49:16,083
Tsunipuh.

540
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,793
Mura.

541
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:34,134
At least we have
a path to follow.

542
00:51:34,221 --> 00:51:35,744
How far to Fort Caspar?

543
00:51:35,831 --> 00:51:37,137
Couple a weeks.

544
00:51:37,224 --> 00:51:39,792
We just might pull this off.

545
00:51:39,879 --> 00:51:41,402
We meet here
when the flowers bloom.

546
00:51:41,489 --> 00:51:43,317
When do the flowers bloom?

547
00:51:43,404 --> 00:51:45,972
In your new home it's April.

548
00:51:46,059 --> 00:51:47,234
Here it is June.

549
00:51:48,583 --> 00:51:49,743
I'll meet you here in June.

550
00:52:12,216 --> 00:52:13,217
Sam!

551
00:52:26,665 --> 00:52:27,883
I love you!

552
00:53:21,763 --> 00:53:24,375
I felt their
eyes move over me.

553
00:53:24,462 --> 00:53:26,942
Felt their pity
and disapproval...

554
00:53:27,029 --> 00:53:29,554
And it meant nothing to me.

555
00:53:29,641 --> 00:53:33,645
The only thing that mattered
was riding away,

556
00:53:33,732 --> 00:53:35,299
just as I was riding
away from him.

557
00:53:37,388 --> 00:53:39,955
As I pondered
the new journey before me,

558
00:53:40,042 --> 00:53:42,131
making it back to him.

559
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:45,657
They watched the tears run
my cheeks and I let them.

560
00:53:47,789 --> 00:53:51,097
I didn't turn my face
or wipe them away.

561
00:53:51,184 --> 00:53:53,447
Tears we can't control,

562
00:53:53,534 --> 00:53:56,494
sobs and weeps
are little surrenders,

563
00:53:56,581 --> 00:53:59,584
and I will surrender
nothing to the pain.

564
00:53:59,671 --> 00:54:04,284
Tears may flow,
but I will not weep.

565
00:54:04,371 --> 00:54:08,245
I am the wife of a warrior now.

566
00:54:08,332 --> 00:54:12,510
Which is to say, I am a warrior.

567
00:54:12,597 --> 00:54:14,947
And warriors don't cry.

568
00:54:15,034 --> 00:54:16,514
We're wasting time.
