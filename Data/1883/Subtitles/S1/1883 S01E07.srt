1
00:00:40,736 --> 00:00:42,738
Come on, cows.
Hya, hya!

2
00:00:42,825 --> 00:00:44,261
Come on, move, move, move!

3
00:00:59,102 --> 00:01:00,843
Got one speed, that one.
Bullet fast.

4
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,237
Damn cow been a dart
since we rounded her up.

5
00:01:03,324 --> 00:01:04,934
Ain't talking about the cow.

6
00:01:12,942 --> 00:01:15,022
If she ever learns to rope,
we might be out of a job.

7
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,642
Whatever you do,
don't teach her.

8
00:01:20,645 --> 00:01:24,127
The best way to know
if land is truly undiscovered

9
00:01:24,214 --> 00:01:25,781
is to seek words to describe it.

10
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:32,222
When you can't,
you know it's virgin land.

11
00:01:32,309 --> 00:01:34,442
Untouched by our dirty hands.

12
00:01:36,574 --> 00:01:40,578
To see it
is to be silenced by it.

13
00:01:40,665 --> 00:01:46,149
Made speechless
by its endless uniformity...

14
00:01:46,236 --> 00:01:49,326
To crest a rise is to see
another that is identical.

15
00:01:51,589 --> 00:01:54,331
One must read the sun
and stars like a sailor

16
00:01:54,418 --> 00:01:55,637
to navigate this place.

17
00:01:58,727 --> 00:02:02,557
We've seen nothing
but grass for over a week:

18
00:02:02,644 --> 00:02:07,605
no game, no birds, no snakes,

19
00:02:07,692 --> 00:02:10,217
not even a lizard,

20
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:12,871
and no evidence
the human race still exists.

21
00:02:16,614 --> 00:02:19,269
But the plains
are littered with bones.

22
00:02:41,726 --> 00:02:44,425
The dirty hand of man
can go unnoticed in the city.

23
00:02:46,775 --> 00:02:50,648
Because his dirty
hand made the city.

24
00:02:52,998 --> 00:02:54,783
But in this place,

25
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,220
where innocence
is a mineral in the soil,

26
00:02:59,701 --> 00:03:03,183
the filth of our touch
is an apocalypse.

27
00:03:35,737 --> 00:03:36,955
I see 'em.

28
00:03:37,042 --> 00:03:38,305
What do we do?

29
00:03:38,392 --> 00:03:39,891
Keep holding the herd.
Don't worry about them.

30
00:03:39,915 --> 00:03:40,829
They're just payin' the tax.

31
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,744
What tax?

32
00:03:42,831 --> 00:03:45,070
You gotta pay a tax when you
graze cattle in Comanche land.

33
00:03:45,094 --> 00:03:47,270
Well, you don't "gotta",

34
00:03:47,357 --> 00:03:48,769
but if you want
to stay out of a gunfight,

35
00:03:48,793 --> 00:03:50,099
it's a pretty good idea...

36
00:03:50,186 --> 00:03:52,057
The Comanches
can charge a tax?

37
00:03:52,144 --> 00:03:53,494
It's their land.

38
00:03:53,581 --> 00:03:54,843
They can do whatever they want.

39
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,473
The only people who think
this is America

40
00:03:56,497 --> 00:03:58,281
still live in Washington.

41
00:03:58,368 --> 00:04:00,065
There's water in this draw.

42
00:04:00,152 --> 00:04:02,198
Push the herd to it.

43
00:04:02,285 --> 00:04:04,592
We'll make camp here.

44
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:06,333
Carve one out
for the cook first.

45
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,620
All right. Yes, sir.

46
00:04:23,872 --> 00:04:25,439
Yep.

47
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:29,181
Come on.

48
00:05:40,818 --> 00:05:42,603
For me, less fire.

49
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,953
Yeah, I've cooked
for you Comanche before.

50
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,128
I know how you like it.

51
00:05:59,402 --> 00:06:01,665
What the fuck
do you think you're doin'?

52
00:06:01,752 --> 00:06:04,625
Huh? What the fuck do you think
you're doing!

53
00:06:04,712 --> 00:06:06,322
Do you speak English?

54
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:10,848
Who speaks English
for this fucking circus?

55
00:06:10,935 --> 00:06:11,935
I do.

56
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,897
I'm only going
to tell you this once!

57
00:06:15,984 --> 00:06:17,725
All right, y'all get in line,

58
00:06:17,812 --> 00:06:20,031
you stand in a line
besides the table!

59
00:06:20,118 --> 00:06:22,425
You grab a plate,
you grab a fork,

60
00:06:22,512 --> 00:06:26,211
then I give you the food!

61
00:06:26,298 --> 00:06:30,215
When you're done you keep
the plate, you keep the fork!

62
00:06:30,302 --> 00:06:35,525
Go clean 'em in the creek
but don't lose 'em!

63
00:06:35,612 --> 00:06:37,309
Lose 'em you owe
me three dollars

64
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,660
then you're eating
with yer fucking hands.

65
00:06:39,747 --> 00:06:41,792
What is this "fuck?"

66
00:06:45,361 --> 00:06:46,841
Fuck did you just call me?

67
00:06:46,928 --> 00:06:48,451
Yes, what is this fuck?

68
00:06:49,974 --> 00:06:53,108
He don't know
what that word means.

69
00:06:53,195 --> 00:06:54,195
Neither does he.

70
00:06:58,069 --> 00:06:59,331
But he's about to ask her.

71
00:07:00,332 --> 00:07:02,465
Then Lord help you.

72
00:07:02,552 --> 00:07:05,033
So, maybe just don't use it.
Hmm?

73
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,992
- It's a hard one to shake.
- Well, start shaking.

74
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:18,001
Now!

75
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:22,006
What does "fuck" mean, mama?

76
00:07:22,093 --> 00:07:23,704
It means a spanking,
and a good one,

77
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,096
if you say it again.

78
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:28,491
Is he getting a spanking?

79
00:07:28,578 --> 00:07:31,363
Some form of one
is probably headed his way, son.

80
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,974
Mm-hmm. Come on.

81
00:07:33,061 --> 00:07:34,715
Line up!

82
00:07:46,944 --> 00:07:48,598
He says get in line
and they don't.

83
00:07:48,685 --> 00:07:50,861
They're guests.
Guests don't wait in line.

84
00:07:53,255 --> 00:07:54,256
Isn't that good?

85
00:07:58,216 --> 00:07:59,216
Half a steak for him?

86
00:08:01,176 --> 00:08:02,656
Okay, a whole steak.

87
00:08:02,743 --> 00:08:05,049
You use that word
in front of my child again...

88
00:08:05,136 --> 00:08:06,790
I'm gonna stab you
with this fucking fork.

89
00:08:09,924 --> 00:08:11,578
- Yes, ma'am.
- Half a steak is fine.

90
00:08:20,717 --> 00:08:21,877
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

91
00:08:26,984 --> 00:08:27,984
- Thank you.
- Yes, ma'am.

92
00:08:34,775 --> 00:08:37,908
Just so you know,
that could've gone a lot worse.

93
00:08:40,171 --> 00:08:41,259
Lesson learned.

94
00:08:41,346 --> 00:08:42,506
Yeah, we'll see about that.

95
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,750
I think she fancies
those damn Indians.

96
00:09:05,153 --> 00:09:06,850
I wouldn't waste
too much time worrying

97
00:09:06,937 --> 00:09:08,678
about how that
watch works, amigo.

98
00:09:08,765 --> 00:09:10,375
You ain't gonna figure it.

99
00:09:11,507 --> 00:09:12,507
Ch-Ch...

100
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,121
I like your horse.

101
00:09:20,951 --> 00:09:24,259
Lightning. That's his name.

102
00:09:24,346 --> 00:09:25,346
Why Lightning?

103
00:09:28,785 --> 00:09:29,985
Cause that's how fast he is.

104
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:35,487
Show me, then.

105
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,821
Where is she going?

106
00:10:04,908 --> 00:10:05,908
They're gonna race.

107
00:10:06,562 --> 00:10:08,129
They're going to what?

108
00:10:08,216 --> 00:10:09,260
Shit.

109
00:10:17,268 --> 00:10:19,028
I think the voice of reason
has been muted.

110
00:10:19,923 --> 00:10:21,751
Look at her face, honey.

111
00:10:21,838 --> 00:10:23,057
I see it.

112
00:10:23,144 --> 00:10:25,102
I just don't want
to see it fall off.

113
00:10:25,189 --> 00:10:26,602
The one place you ain't got
to worry about her

114
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,888
is on the back of a horse.

115
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:45,078
Y'all ready?

116
00:10:49,387 --> 00:10:50,387
Go!

117
00:11:10,234 --> 00:11:11,514
I think she dropped her reins.

118
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,629
No. She let them go.

119
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:44,007
Lightning.

120
00:11:44,094 --> 00:11:45,269
Told ya.

121
00:11:47,271 --> 00:11:48,969
I think you are the lightning.

122
00:11:49,056 --> 00:11:50,797
Lightning with the yellow hair.

123
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,880
That's what I will call you.

124
00:12:00,676 --> 00:12:02,025
Lightning Yellow Hair.

125
00:12:06,464 --> 00:12:08,249
What do I call you?

126
00:12:08,336 --> 00:12:09,337
Sam.

127
00:12:11,818 --> 00:12:12,819
Sam?

128
00:12:14,081 --> 00:12:16,257
Sam.

129
00:12:16,344 --> 00:12:19,216
Why Sam?

130
00:12:19,303 --> 00:12:21,263
That was the name
of the man who killed my wife.

131
00:12:26,223 --> 00:12:27,703
I know because
I made him tell me.

132
00:12:30,837 --> 00:12:32,142
Then I killed him and took it.

133
00:12:43,414 --> 00:12:44,414
I killed a man.

134
00:12:49,681 --> 00:12:51,422
But I didn't know
to take his name.

135
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:52,772
You don't want his name.

136
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,055
With his name you mourn forever.

137
00:12:59,691 --> 00:13:00,997
Your name is Lightning.

138
00:13:02,085 --> 00:13:03,086
Lightning doesn't mourn.

139
00:13:06,611 --> 00:13:07,612
Doesn't do that either.

140
00:13:16,317 --> 00:13:17,840
God gave you a good face.

141
00:13:23,454 --> 00:13:24,891
And yellow hair.

142
00:13:59,969 --> 00:14:01,231
You need a better knife.

143
00:14:13,374 --> 00:14:14,288
That's too much.

144
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:15,767
You won the race.

145
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:19,946
It's not mine anymore.

146
00:14:20,033 --> 00:14:21,338
It's yours.

147
00:14:45,754 --> 00:14:47,147
You're still up?

148
00:14:47,234 --> 00:14:49,845
I can't sleep
when it's cloudy.

149
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:51,212
Staring at clouds
makes me think.

150
00:14:53,414 --> 00:14:54,806
I need stars to dream...

151
00:14:57,766 --> 00:14:58,985
Oh, to be eighteen again...

152
00:15:00,812 --> 00:15:03,163
- Where are you going?
- To dream of indoor plumbing.

153
00:15:08,995 --> 00:15:09,996
Are you happy?

154
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,914
In general or at this moment?

155
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,220
Both.

156
00:15:25,228 --> 00:15:27,013
In general...

157
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,840
I'm worried.

158
00:15:33,454 --> 00:15:37,414
As a wife. As a mother.

159
00:15:37,501 --> 00:15:39,634
Our survival feels...

160
00:15:41,853 --> 00:15:43,507
Beyond our control out here.

161
00:15:43,594 --> 00:15:45,161
So, no.

162
00:15:47,598 --> 00:15:49,252
I'm not happy generally.

163
00:15:54,388 --> 00:16:01,830
But in this moment,
with the man I love,

164
00:16:01,917 --> 00:16:04,050
a son I adore,
and a daughter I envy...

165
00:16:05,921 --> 00:16:06,922
I am very happy.

166
00:16:12,362 --> 00:16:14,538
However, if you don't
get some sleep,

167
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,671
I will not envy you tomorrow.
Hm.

168
00:16:23,373 --> 00:16:24,373
I love you.

169
00:16:29,249 --> 00:16:33,079
People think because
it's where rain comes from,

170
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:36,647
clouds are filled with water.

171
00:16:36,734 --> 00:16:38,736
But how can that be?

172
00:16:38,823 --> 00:16:41,522
How can water float
above us then fall,

173
00:16:41,609 --> 00:16:44,046
as though gravity
only applies to the sky

174
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:45,178
when the sky lets it.

175
00:16:46,701 --> 00:16:49,617
But that would mean
the sky thinks

176
00:16:49,704 --> 00:16:52,446
and clouds are alive
and they decide to let it rain.

177
00:16:52,533 --> 00:16:55,579
But how do
they decide where to rain?

178
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:58,843
And when...

179
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:03,544
Why do clouds choose to flood
one place and deny another

180
00:17:03,631 --> 00:17:06,634
until the earth cracks
and field becomes desert?

181
00:17:09,202 --> 00:17:11,987
Maybe there's
no such thing as gravity.

182
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:17,601
Maybe everything scientists
have "discovered" is a lie,

183
00:17:17,688 --> 00:17:20,387
and wind is the world
laughing at us.

184
00:17:27,176 --> 00:17:31,006
How's it been with bandits?

185
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:32,442
Worse the way you're going.

186
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,709
And you're the perfect size:
big enough to be a prize,

187
00:17:38,796 --> 00:17:40,624
small enough to fight.

188
00:17:40,711 --> 00:17:42,452
Here is mostly thieves.

189
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:44,628
North of Kansas and the Wyoming,

190
00:17:44,715 --> 00:17:46,195
they're still having a war.

191
00:17:48,371 --> 00:17:50,721
Wagons don't go
that way anymore.

192
00:17:51,722 --> 00:17:53,463
People take the train...

193
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,950
If I knew a way
around I'd tell you.

194
00:17:54,986 --> 00:17:58,164
The way around is they
decide to live in Colorado.

195
00:18:02,037 --> 00:18:03,256
The sky is angry.

196
00:18:06,172 --> 00:18:08,087
Thieves out here
use the storms to hide.

197
00:18:08,174 --> 00:18:10,176
I'll keep that in mind.

198
00:18:18,532 --> 00:18:22,405
You're welcome to stay the
night, ride out in the morning.

199
00:18:22,492 --> 00:18:24,494
The storm will be
here tomorrow.

200
00:18:24,581 --> 00:18:26,801
You should leave, too.

201
00:18:26,888 --> 00:18:27,888
I wish I could.

202
00:18:32,763 --> 00:18:35,810
Take them to Colorado.

203
00:18:35,897 --> 00:18:38,029
Leave them there.

204
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,727
Better for them.

205
00:18:39,814 --> 00:18:41,337
Yeah.

206
00:19:01,879 --> 00:19:04,012
Cookie's gone.

207
00:19:04,099 --> 00:19:05,318
Where'd he go?

208
00:19:05,405 --> 00:19:06,667
Don't know.

209
00:19:06,754 --> 00:19:09,365
Just gone.

210
00:19:09,452 --> 00:19:13,674
He wouldn't quit us.
Not out here.

211
00:19:13,761 --> 00:19:15,371
That's suicide.

212
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:18,461
Maybe he trying
to get ahead of the storm.

213
00:19:18,548 --> 00:19:22,117
I wish we had.

214
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:24,511
I don't think
we can baby 'em anymore.

215
00:19:24,598 --> 00:19:26,252
They're gonna have
to get tough or die.

216
00:19:50,928 --> 00:19:52,048
Why are you sleeping here?

217
00:19:55,281 --> 00:19:56,760
I slept out there with him.

218
00:19:58,849 --> 00:19:59,937
Fair enough.

219
00:20:01,852 --> 00:20:03,376
We gotta get moving.
Get to the herd.

220
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,160
There's a storm coming.

221
00:20:12,428 --> 00:20:13,428
Let's go, sweetie.

222
00:21:08,441 --> 00:21:09,920
Elsa...

223
00:21:10,007 --> 00:21:12,140
Elsa... Elsa, don't chase 'em!

224
00:21:12,227 --> 00:21:13,837
You'll scatter the herd.

225
00:21:13,924 --> 00:21:15,075
They'll head for low country
and bed down.

226
00:21:15,099 --> 00:21:16,294
We'll find them after it passes.

227
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:17,928
- Just let them go?
- Let them go.

228
00:21:23,847 --> 00:21:26,241
Stop the wagon!
Stop the wagon!

229
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:27,242
Whoa!

230
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:29,810
Get down now!

231
00:21:29,897 --> 00:21:31,377
Run into the wind,

232
00:21:31,464 --> 00:21:33,248
find the lowest spot
and lay down!

233
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:35,119
Why into the wind?

234
00:21:35,206 --> 00:21:37,034
So all this shit
doesn't blow in on you.

235
00:21:37,121 --> 00:21:38,121
Go on!

236
00:21:41,604 --> 00:21:43,171
Got to unhitch the horses!

237
00:21:43,258 --> 00:21:45,042
- What?
- Got to unhitch the horses

238
00:21:45,129 --> 00:21:46,237
before they run away with you!

239
00:21:46,261 --> 00:21:48,394
Whoa, whoa!

240
00:21:50,178 --> 00:21:51,527
We'll saddle one for you

241
00:21:51,614 --> 00:21:53,224
and we'll pick
the rest up later.

242
00:21:57,185 --> 00:21:59,013
James...

243
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,319
What is that?

244
00:22:04,671 --> 00:22:05,759
Tornado.

245
00:22:24,038 --> 00:22:25,256
Here she comes.

246
00:22:27,955 --> 00:22:29,348
Take him.

247
00:22:32,046 --> 00:22:33,787
Down. Down, son. Down.

248
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,312
Gotta pull the saddle.

249
00:22:45,102 --> 00:22:47,714
What about Elsa?

250
00:22:47,801 --> 00:22:49,759
This is as low as we're
going to be able to get.

251
00:22:49,846 --> 00:22:53,284
There's nothing
you can do for us.

252
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,372
What are you gonna do?

253
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:55,896
What are you gonna do, James?

254
00:22:55,983 --> 00:22:58,289
You gonna fight this tornado
when it comes for us?

255
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:01,075
I don't know what I'm gonna do
but I'm gonna do it right here.

256
00:23:01,162 --> 00:23:02,946
She's a survivor.

257
00:23:03,033 --> 00:23:04,426
Lay down!

258
00:23:05,906 --> 00:23:06,906
What do we do?

259
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,082
We run.

260
00:23:08,169 --> 00:23:10,519
Which direction?

261
00:23:10,606 --> 00:23:11,868
That way.

262
00:23:27,188 --> 00:23:28,188
Easy, boy.

263
00:23:47,295 --> 00:23:48,339
Turn the horse loose.

264
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,689
How will they make it?

265
00:23:49,776 --> 00:23:51,430
They won't. Turn him loose.

266
00:24:02,963 --> 00:24:03,963
I love you.

267
00:24:05,182 --> 00:24:06,575
Go!

268
00:26:08,131 --> 00:26:09,698
I'm gonna go find her.

269
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:16,444
Where are we
going to go, mama?

270
00:26:18,272 --> 00:26:19,490
We're gonna go help.

271
00:26:20,448 --> 00:26:22,232
Come on, let's go.

272
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:31,475
Should we pick it up?

273
00:27:33,347 --> 00:27:34,827
We look for horses first.

274
00:27:53,062 --> 00:27:54,411
I guess you're both Lightning.

275
00:28:20,786 --> 00:28:22,744
Storm couldn't catch up
to you, could it?

276
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,062
I'll look for more.

277
00:28:36,149 --> 00:28:37,890
How you gonna bring 'em back?

278
00:28:53,993 --> 00:28:55,995
This has been
a fun first week.

279
00:28:57,126 --> 00:28:58,345
This deal ain't dull.

280
00:29:00,216 --> 00:29:01,609
Got chased by a tornado

281
00:29:01,696 --> 00:29:03,785
and lost a girl to an Injun
at the same time.

282
00:29:05,439 --> 00:29:07,310
Gotta have it
to lose it, partner.

283
00:29:09,312 --> 00:29:12,838
I admit, uh...

284
00:29:12,925 --> 00:29:15,231
I might have overestimated
my appeal.

285
00:30:51,153 --> 00:30:52,676
Everything you see
and everything

286
00:30:52,763 --> 00:30:55,288
you saw yesterday is my home.

287
00:30:55,375 --> 00:30:57,768
You're always welcome in it,
Lighting with the Yellow Hair.

288
00:30:59,814 --> 00:31:01,642
It's your home too, now.

289
00:31:31,715 --> 00:31:32,847
I knew you'd make it.

290
00:31:32,934 --> 00:31:34,254
It chased us
for a mile or more.

291
00:31:36,242 --> 00:31:40,246
We found a spot to lay down
and it went right over us.

292
00:31:40,333 --> 00:31:43,336
Well, now you can tell anybody who'll
listen that you lived through hell.

293
00:31:43,423 --> 00:31:46,165
It wasn't hell, daddy.

294
00:31:46,252 --> 00:31:48,080
It was beautiful.

295
00:31:49,385 --> 00:31:50,754
Well, baby girl,
you must've been chased

296
00:31:50,778 --> 00:31:51,886
by a different tornado
than I was,

297
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,433
because my tornado was hell.

298
00:31:55,391 --> 00:31:56,958
Rest of them make it?

299
00:31:57,045 --> 00:31:58,045
They're behind me.

300
00:31:58,090 --> 00:31:59,170
Let's get 'em mounted up.

301
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,157
Now we have nothing.

302
00:33:10,118 --> 00:33:12,120
How do we survive with nothing?

303
00:33:12,207 --> 00:33:14,557
We didn't lose
nothing you can't replace.

304
00:33:14,644 --> 00:33:16,211
Replace with what?

305
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,259
We have nothing.

306
00:33:20,346 --> 00:33:21,782
No money, nothing.

307
00:33:21,869 --> 00:33:26,917
Look. I got money
enough for the both of us...

308
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,224
You ain't lose nothing.

309
00:33:34,969 --> 00:33:38,929
Now let's...
Let's pick up what we can find.

310
00:34:20,362 --> 00:34:21,581
Josef?

311
00:34:28,892 --> 00:34:29,893
Josef...

312
00:34:45,518 --> 00:34:47,476
I'll go look for your horse.

313
00:34:50,523 --> 00:34:52,829
How many wagons
you think we can salvage?

314
00:34:52,916 --> 00:34:54,135
Maybe two.

315
00:34:56,790 --> 00:35:00,359
That makes eight
with what's left.

316
00:35:00,446 --> 00:35:02,578
For twenty-six adults
and twenty-two children...

317
00:35:02,665 --> 00:35:05,059
Ain't enough.

318
00:35:05,146 --> 00:35:07,714
I know it.

319
00:35:07,801 --> 00:35:10,325
Where's the nearest town at
where we can buy more?

320
00:35:10,412 --> 00:35:14,112
Denver. We gotta turn back.

321
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:17,419
They ain't gonna make it
if half of them are walking.

322
00:35:17,506 --> 00:35:19,117
It's a month
to Doan's with wagons.

323
00:35:20,683 --> 00:35:21,683
What are they gonna eat?

324
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:24,426
Cattle if we can find 'em.

325
00:35:24,513 --> 00:35:26,298
Horses if we can't.

326
00:35:26,385 --> 00:35:29,170
- I ain't eating no horse.
- I ain't either.

327
00:35:30,606 --> 00:35:31,651
So, what do we eat?

328
00:35:33,479 --> 00:35:35,916
I guess we don't.

329
00:35:47,971 --> 00:35:48,972
You made it.

330
00:35:50,278 --> 00:35:51,410
Thank you.

331
00:35:55,718 --> 00:35:57,416
All right, we'll gather
up this herd.

332
00:36:13,736 --> 00:36:16,086
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

333
00:36:18,567 --> 00:36:20,613
Thought maybe you quit us.

334
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,181
Just got ahead of the storm.

335
00:36:23,268 --> 00:36:24,549
Ain't my first trip
through the plains.

336
00:36:24,573 --> 00:36:25,966
Figured y'all was
right behind me.

337
00:36:26,053 --> 00:36:27,053
We should've been.

338
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,665
How many died?

339
00:36:29,752 --> 00:36:30,752
None.

340
00:36:32,451 --> 00:36:34,571
Sounds like holding them
was the right choice, then.

341
00:36:34,757 --> 00:36:37,064
Mm.

342
00:36:37,151 --> 00:36:39,719
Running a team at night,
that will pucker yer red eye.

343
00:36:48,031 --> 00:36:49,294
I'm gonna take this one back.

344
00:36:49,381 --> 00:36:51,296
I'm right behind you.

345
00:36:51,383 --> 00:36:53,298
Any chance you
saw those cattle?

346
00:36:53,385 --> 00:36:55,648
I saw 'em. About a mile back.

347
00:36:55,735 --> 00:36:58,477
Six of yer boys
was gathering 'em up.

348
00:36:58,564 --> 00:37:00,566
We don't have six boys.

349
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,581
We got thieves.

350
00:37:39,996 --> 00:37:42,085
Cattle thieves
gathered the herd.

351
00:37:42,172 --> 00:37:44,131
- Where?
- Couple miles north.

352
00:37:44,218 --> 00:37:46,220
- How many?
- Six.

353
00:37:46,307 --> 00:37:47,467
Wade: Well, let's go get 'em.

354
00:37:47,526 --> 00:37:49,615
We could hold the cattle up,

355
00:37:49,702 --> 00:37:52,095
then double back and go
after the pioneers next.

356
00:37:52,182 --> 00:37:53,706
Just have 'em
circle the wagons.

357
00:37:53,793 --> 00:37:56,186
Ain't enough
wagons to circle anymore.

358
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,425
You, me, and Thomas
go for the herd.

359
00:37:57,449 --> 00:37:59,102
The rest will stay
with the wagons.

360
00:37:59,189 --> 00:38:00,669
I'm going with you.

361
00:38:00,756 --> 00:38:02,430
Young lady, you have been
in your last gun fight.

362
00:38:02,454 --> 00:38:05,500
You just said it's as likely
they double back as move on.

363
00:38:05,587 --> 00:38:08,851
Then the gunfight's
back there and you're here.

364
00:38:08,938 --> 00:38:11,506
If there's gonna be a gunfight,
I wanna be with you.

365
00:38:13,552 --> 00:38:15,118
Can I get some help here?

366
00:38:15,205 --> 00:38:17,817
Sorry to say sounds like
she's winning this argument.

367
00:38:19,862 --> 00:38:22,387
When we find 'em you sit still

368
00:38:22,474 --> 00:38:24,040
till we're done
with them, understand?

369
00:38:32,353 --> 00:38:34,573
This is the strangest outfit
I ever worked for.

370
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,835
It'll test yer noggin.

371
00:38:55,071 --> 00:38:56,682
You wanna tell her?

372
00:38:56,769 --> 00:38:58,129
Hell, no,
I don't wanna tell her.

373
00:38:58,205 --> 00:38:59,424
We gotta tell her something.

374
00:39:08,389 --> 00:39:10,478
Them pioneers find their rifles?

375
00:39:10,565 --> 00:39:13,786
Found a few.
They're right there.

376
00:39:13,873 --> 00:39:16,092
I'd get them loaded
and handed out.

377
00:39:16,179 --> 00:39:17,877
Why?

378
00:39:17,964 --> 00:39:20,923
Looks like some thieves
picked up our cattle.

379
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:23,317
I doubt it'll happen this way,
but they could double back.

380
00:39:23,404 --> 00:39:26,799
Where's my husband?

381
00:39:26,886 --> 00:39:28,104
Went after them.

382
00:39:30,411 --> 00:39:31,717
Where's my daughter?

383
00:39:34,023 --> 00:39:36,374
She said the safest place
on earth is right behind him.

384
00:39:41,161 --> 00:39:42,554
I want you boys to sit here

385
00:39:42,641 --> 00:39:44,599
and guard my son with your life.

386
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,089
I need your horse.

387
00:39:56,176 --> 00:39:57,743
Why?

388
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:58,831
So I can go get her.

389
00:40:01,486 --> 00:40:02,965
Get off the goddam horse.

390
00:40:14,977 --> 00:40:16,588
You guard my son
with your life.

391
00:40:16,675 --> 00:40:17,980
You understand me?

392
00:40:18,067 --> 00:40:19,634
Yes, ma'am.

393
00:40:24,509 --> 00:40:28,034
Well...

394
00:40:28,121 --> 00:40:29,775
I see where the girl gets it.

395
00:40:29,862 --> 00:40:31,646
Apple don't fall far.

396
00:40:33,692 --> 00:40:35,737
Y'all wanna hunt
for grasshoppers?

397
00:40:42,178 --> 00:40:43,223
Sure.

398
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,681
That ain't six, Captain.

399
00:41:06,768 --> 00:41:07,768
I count twelve.

400
00:41:09,554 --> 00:41:10,816
Thirteen.

401
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:17,039
Run. And fan out wide.

402
00:41:26,222 --> 00:41:29,399
You keep running,
don't stop, no matter what!

403
00:42:52,787 --> 00:42:53,787
I felt no fear.

404
00:42:56,182 --> 00:42:57,662
It simply became another race.

405
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,754
We fear what we don't know.

406
00:43:02,841 --> 00:43:04,016
I knew what would happen.

407
00:43:06,453 --> 00:43:11,589
I would win the race
or I would be killed.

408
00:43:11,676 --> 00:43:14,504
There was comfort
in the simplicity of it.

409
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:17,420
Even though I could
hear hooves getting closer,

410
00:43:17,507 --> 00:43:19,118
I felt no fear.

411
00:43:36,135 --> 00:43:39,312
There is horror
to every killing.

412
00:43:39,399 --> 00:43:42,271
Even when it's justified.

413
00:43:42,358 --> 00:43:46,232
Even when I killed,
I was horrified.

414
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:49,627
But watching Sam kill
was like watching a lion

415
00:43:49,714 --> 00:43:51,759
hurl itself into a deer.

416
00:43:59,549 --> 00:44:05,381
His fury was so magnificent,
there was no time for horror.

417
00:44:05,468 --> 00:44:06,731
Not even for the men he killed.

418
00:44:12,562 --> 00:44:15,130
I questioned my mind.

419
00:44:15,217 --> 00:44:18,699
I wondered if I am the one
who is dead

420
00:44:18,786 --> 00:44:20,527
and this is all a dream.

421
00:44:24,792 --> 00:44:31,233
I watched him ride away
and decided I must be awake.

422
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,408
I must be alive.

423
00:44:34,889 --> 00:44:36,369
Then I chased after him.

424
00:45:35,602 --> 00:45:36,734
Ah!

425
00:45:51,183 --> 00:45:52,183
How bad?

426
00:45:55,230 --> 00:45:56,405
Went through your belt.

427
00:45:56,492 --> 00:45:58,277
Take it off.

428
00:46:03,195 --> 00:46:04,631
What the hell?
It sits right there.

429
00:46:04,718 --> 00:46:05,806
Get it out.

430
00:46:05,893 --> 00:46:07,133
I think I can squeeze it out.

431
00:46:09,331 --> 00:46:11,681
Ah!

432
00:46:17,644 --> 00:46:19,733
Little souvenir for your son.

433
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:21,691
The bullet that didn't kill you.

434
00:46:27,436 --> 00:46:29,699
Just a ricochet.

435
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:30,918
Ain't in too deep.

436
00:46:31,005 --> 00:46:32,964
Still got to dig
that lead out.

437
00:46:34,879 --> 00:46:37,620
How's the other one?

438
00:46:37,707 --> 00:46:40,319
Just skinned me.

439
00:46:40,406 --> 00:46:42,446
I think you used up
the last of your luck, Thomas.

440
00:46:45,106 --> 00:46:46,629
How bad is your'n.

441
00:46:46,716 --> 00:46:47,848
I didn't get hit.

442
00:46:53,114 --> 00:46:54,812
Shit. What the hell?

443
00:47:00,295 --> 00:47:01,731
I can't find it.

444
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,298
Do you see it?

445
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:05,648
Turn around.

446
00:47:07,912 --> 00:47:11,306
Got to be coming
from somewhere.

447
00:47:11,393 --> 00:47:12,830
Take off your hat, Captain.

448
00:47:19,227 --> 00:47:23,014
Ah...

449
00:47:23,101 --> 00:47:24,319
I'll be damned.

450
00:47:27,714 --> 00:47:29,759
Now you used up all
your luck, too, Captain.

451
00:47:49,431 --> 00:47:51,390
If I recall, Thomas,
this one is yours.

452
00:47:51,477 --> 00:47:52,913
She is.

453
00:47:54,349 --> 00:47:57,178
I swear, Shea,

454
00:47:57,265 --> 00:47:58,764
when you bite off
more than you can chew,

455
00:47:58,788 --> 00:48:00,225
you sure bite big.

456
00:48:00,312 --> 00:48:01,879
I ain't ashamed to say it,

457
00:48:01,966 --> 00:48:04,272
you are a beautiful
sight, Charlie.

458
00:48:04,359 --> 00:48:06,057
What the hell are you
doing out here?

459
00:48:06,144 --> 00:48:10,931
Same as you apparently.
Hunting bandits and strays.

460
00:48:11,018 --> 00:48:14,892
Though you seem to herd
all your bandits up at once.

461
00:48:14,979 --> 00:48:17,546
Hell, we sure appreciate you.

462
00:48:17,633 --> 00:48:20,003
Killing cattle thieves is one
the West's five great pleasures.

463
00:48:20,027 --> 00:48:21,115
No need for thanks.

464
00:48:21,202 --> 00:48:23,422
You can save your thanks
for them.

465
00:48:23,509 --> 00:48:24,989
We'll do more than that.

466
00:48:25,076 --> 00:48:27,208
You're only up to five now?

467
00:48:27,295 --> 00:48:29,428
Well, I'm pickier
than you, sir.

468
00:48:29,515 --> 00:48:32,692
I added horse and sunrise
from the saddle

469
00:48:32,779 --> 00:48:35,564
and riding the wild country,
I thought they deserved a spot.

470
00:48:35,651 --> 00:48:37,479
I thought they was
already on your list.

471
00:48:37,566 --> 00:48:39,829
No, just added.

472
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,919
Don't like to get up that early.

473
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,491
You're hurt.

474
00:48:49,578 --> 00:48:50,928
I'm fine.

475
00:48:53,756 --> 00:48:55,280
Are you fine?

476
00:48:57,717 --> 00:48:59,023
I'm fine, too.

477
00:49:19,565 --> 00:49:20,958
Ah...

478
00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:28,139
Don't suppose you care
to bury these folks?

479
00:49:28,226 --> 00:49:29,420
Tell you the truth, Charlie,

480
00:49:29,444 --> 00:49:30,884
I don't think they're
worth the hole.

481
00:49:32,926 --> 00:49:34,493
Where's your camp?

482
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:36,799
I know it.

483
00:49:36,886 --> 00:49:39,019
Well, they may not deserve it

484
00:49:39,106 --> 00:49:39,977
but someone should say a prayer

485
00:49:40,064 --> 00:49:41,804
over these sorry
sons of bitches.

486
00:49:41,891 --> 00:49:43,806
I doubt you care to hear.

487
00:49:43,893 --> 00:49:45,460
I don't.

488
00:49:45,547 --> 00:49:47,201
We need to get back
to our people.

489
00:49:48,333 --> 00:49:49,551
We'll meet you there.

490
00:50:29,809 --> 00:50:30,984
Elsa?

491
00:50:32,855 --> 00:50:33,987
Elsa!

492
00:50:47,783 --> 00:50:49,220
Give me your horse.

493
00:50:53,224 --> 00:50:54,224
I ain't aski...

494
00:51:10,676 --> 00:51:13,026
She wouldn't speak when
we got back to camp.

495
00:51:14,897 --> 00:51:20,338
Wouldn't look at my father...
Wouldn't look at me.

496
00:51:20,425 --> 00:51:23,210
I heard her crying
by the fire before dawn.

497
00:51:23,297 --> 00:51:27,649
I sat beside her
and asked her what was wrong.

498
00:51:27,736 --> 00:51:30,870
She said she killed a man
over a horse.

499
00:51:30,957 --> 00:51:34,787
And now John was the only hope
our family has to reach Heaven.

500
00:51:37,659 --> 00:51:41,446
I didn't have the heart to tell
her there is no Heaven to go to,

501
00:51:41,533 --> 00:51:43,143
because we're in it already.

502
00:51:44,884 --> 00:51:47,626
We're in hell, too.
They coexist.

503
00:51:47,713 --> 00:51:50,019
Right beside each other.

504
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:54,111
And God is the land.
