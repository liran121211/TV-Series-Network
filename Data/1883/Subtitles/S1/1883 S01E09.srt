1
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,473
<i>I had convinced myself
of the world"s ambivalence</i>

2
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,650
<i>toward its inhabitants,
until I came to this place.</i>

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,220
<i>This place doesn"t want
inhabitants at all.</i>

4
00:00:48,874 --> 00:00:53,053
<i>Every plant is inedible,
every creek bed is dry.</i>

5
00:00:56,143 --> 00:00:58,797
<i>Though only September, snow
covers the mountain peaks.</i>

6
00:01:01,409 --> 00:01:03,933
<i>Winter can"t wait to have at us.</i>

7
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:07,371
<i>Can"t wait to join with the
land and run us off or kill us.</i>

8
00:01:12,768 --> 00:01:17,468
<i>If land can have emotions,
this land hates.</i>

9
00:01:17,555 --> 00:01:21,907
<i>It hates us, and
everyone can feel it...</i>

10
00:01:43,059 --> 00:01:44,626
- Risa!
- Whoa!

11
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,419
Hey! Hey, don"t shoot!

12
00:01:55,506 --> 00:01:56,506
You"ll spook the horses.

13
00:02:12,915 --> 00:02:15,222
How bad he get you?

14
00:02:15,309 --> 00:02:16,469
- What happened?
- Snake bite.

15
00:02:18,573 --> 00:02:19,487
You got that tourniquet?

16
00:02:19,574 --> 00:02:20,574
Yeah.

17
00:02:36,547 --> 00:02:38,723
You think the Army?

18
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:42,510
What for?
Just women and kids.

19
00:02:42,597 --> 00:02:44,120
Never stopped "em before.

20
00:02:45,643 --> 00:02:46,905
Had their way with that one.

21
00:02:48,733 --> 00:02:50,126
Someone did this for sport.

22
00:02:57,307 --> 00:02:58,743
They did it for horses, too.

23
00:03:00,484 --> 00:03:02,443
A lot of tracks
here with no shoes.

24
00:03:04,575 --> 00:03:08,710
Out here, all
these tracks are shod.

25
00:03:08,797 --> 00:03:11,843
- At least six of "em.
- Yep.

26
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,802
These are Lakota.

27
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:16,457
They"re gonna get
where they"re going,

28
00:03:16,544 --> 00:03:18,086
warriors are gonna
come looking for "em.

29
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,242
If they ain"t already...

30
00:03:23,028 --> 00:03:24,028
James, stop!

31
00:03:27,816 --> 00:03:31,036
I"m getting old.
Getting sloppy and getting old.

32
00:03:31,123 --> 00:03:32,763
- Goddammit.
- I didn"t think of it neither.

33
00:03:34,953 --> 00:03:36,128
I"m real sorry, Captain.

34
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,348
Think about what?

35
00:03:38,435 --> 00:03:40,350
Now our tracks are everywhere.

36
00:03:40,437 --> 00:03:42,309
That"s what, farmer.

37
00:03:42,396 --> 00:03:44,354
Anyone who passes here
is gonna think we did it.

38
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:51,621
Stay there.

39
00:03:57,062 --> 00:03:58,847
What happened?

40
00:03:58,934 --> 00:04:00,196
Horse thieves is what happened.

41
00:04:00,283 --> 00:04:03,025
You don"t need to see it.

42
00:04:03,112 --> 00:04:05,027
Josef got snake bit.

43
00:04:05,114 --> 00:04:08,639
His wife fell off her horse.
She"s in a pretty bad way.

44
00:04:08,726 --> 00:04:09,726
Show me.

45
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,024
All right.

46
00:05:29,111 --> 00:05:30,939
Do your best to stay still.

47
00:05:39,687 --> 00:05:40,687
Here we go.

48
00:05:58,314 --> 00:05:59,402
You"re doing good.

49
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,361
How"s his wife?

50
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,767
She drinks but can"t
keep the water.

51
00:06:20,075 --> 00:06:22,033
She needs a doctor.

52
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,295
So does he.

53
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,428
What about these thieves?

54
00:06:25,515 --> 00:06:28,300
They need doctors.
Fort Caspar will have "em.

55
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,825
We need to head the other way

56
00:06:30,912 --> 00:06:32,712
if we"re going to
solve this problem we found.

57
00:06:32,783 --> 00:06:33,783
I know.

58
00:06:35,656 --> 00:06:36,656
James?

59
00:06:45,187 --> 00:06:46,623
How bad?

60
00:06:48,146 --> 00:06:49,146
It don"t get much worse.

61
00:06:52,803 --> 00:06:54,892
How can I help?

62
00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:56,435
Just keep "em as
comfortable as you can.

63
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:57,852
We"re gonna to figure this out.

64
00:07:03,248 --> 00:07:04,772
Maybe we all go to the fort.

65
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,645
Send the soldiers
out to deal with this.

66
00:07:08,732 --> 00:07:10,995
This problem is gonna
haunt every wagon

67
00:07:11,082 --> 00:07:14,085
that crosses here
in the next six months.

68
00:07:14,172 --> 00:07:16,479
We are crossing through
Lakota land, Shoshone land,

69
00:07:16,566 --> 00:07:19,787
Nez Perce land, Blackfoot land.

70
00:07:19,874 --> 00:07:21,852
And every one of them"s going
to know what happened here

71
00:07:21,876 --> 00:07:24,313
before we get to "em.

72
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,403
We need to stay right here until
we find those murderers,

73
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:32,495
kill their sorry asses, cut the
hair from their fucking scalps,

74
00:07:32,582 --> 00:07:34,628
take them and
the horses back to the husbands

75
00:07:34,715 --> 00:07:37,065
and fathers of these people.

76
00:07:37,152 --> 00:07:42,026
If we send a couple of
wagons to the fort,

77
00:07:42,113 --> 00:07:43,439
Indians ain"t gonna think
a couple wagons

78
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,942
is responsible for anything.

79
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:47,815
We can"t spare a guide.

80
00:07:47,902 --> 00:07:49,817
Wade and Colton need
to stay here,

81
00:07:49,904 --> 00:07:52,733
and that"s with just the three
of us going after the thieves.

82
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:57,259
Thieves travel their horses
at night, I know that much.

83
00:07:57,346 --> 00:07:59,740
These sons of bitches
are out there somewhere

84
00:07:59,827 --> 00:08:01,176
sleeping in the shade.

85
00:08:03,526 --> 00:08:06,747
We go get "em, then we move
these wagons to the fort.

86
00:08:12,056 --> 00:08:13,580
Wade, Colton...

87
00:08:16,321 --> 00:08:17,584
How big was the snake?

88
00:08:23,154 --> 00:08:24,547
Shit.

89
00:08:24,634 --> 00:08:26,114
These big ones,

90
00:08:26,201 --> 00:08:28,464
they"ll dry bite as many
times as they won"t.

91
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:30,335
How"s the woman?

92
00:08:30,422 --> 00:08:32,424
Head"s swole up like a balloon.

93
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,730
We should get her to the fort.

94
00:08:38,213 --> 00:08:41,216
Thieves killed an
family of Indians up here.

95
00:08:41,303 --> 00:08:43,087
We got to run them down

96
00:08:43,174 --> 00:08:44,325
or the whole world"s
gonna think we did it.

97
00:08:44,349 --> 00:08:45,916
Why would they think it"s us?

98
00:08:46,003 --> 00:08:48,310
Because our tracks
lead right to "em.

99
00:08:48,397 --> 00:08:50,834
Everyone"s tracks lead to it.
It"s the Oregon Trail.

100
00:08:50,921 --> 00:08:52,662
You see any other tracks
around here?

101
00:08:58,102 --> 00:08:59,102
It"s just us and them.

102
00:09:00,975 --> 00:09:02,256
What the hell are
we supposed to do

103
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,934
if a bunch of Indians show up?

104
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:06,197
You walk "em down to those
bodies and you show "em.

105
00:09:06,284 --> 00:09:10,071
You explain best you can
we"re tracking the thieves

106
00:09:10,158 --> 00:09:12,769
and we"re gonna bring
their horses back, and scalps.

107
00:09:12,856 --> 00:09:15,119
With all the fucking
Lakota I speak?

108
00:09:15,206 --> 00:09:17,054
I can barely get my point across
to these goddamn immigrants.

109
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:18,122
Figure it out.

110
00:09:20,777 --> 00:09:21,885
Want us to bury
them or something?

111
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:22,909
No, don"t touch them.

112
00:09:24,085 --> 00:09:25,652
All right.

113
00:09:34,443 --> 00:09:35,705
Wish there was a better way.

114
00:09:38,142 --> 00:09:40,057
Just come back to me.

115
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:43,713
I love you.

116
00:09:55,812 --> 00:09:56,813
Let me have him.

117
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:02,253
Whoa.

118
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:05,605
Nope.

119
00:10:05,692 --> 00:10:08,085
We"ve done that once.
We ain"t doing it again.

120
00:10:09,521 --> 00:10:10,521
Stay here.

121
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,259
If there is any trouble at all,

122
00:10:51,346 --> 00:10:53,914
you hide in the clothes box,
you understand me?

123
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:55,785
- What kind of trouble?
- Any kind at all.

124
00:10:58,135 --> 00:10:59,310
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

125
00:10:59,397 --> 00:11:02,487
Shit.
Why did y"all stop?

126
00:11:02,574 --> 00:11:05,882
Risa fell from her horse
and Josef was bit by a snake.

127
00:11:05,969 --> 00:11:07,971
We gotta get out of here.
Where"s Shea?

128
00:11:08,058 --> 00:11:09,669
Where"s Shea?!

129
00:11:09,756 --> 00:11:12,076
He went with my father and
Thomas to hunt down the thieves.

130
00:11:13,455 --> 00:11:14,855
There ain"t no hired
guns with you?!

131
00:11:19,374 --> 00:11:23,160
All right, we all need
to mount up.

132
00:11:23,247 --> 00:11:24,814
We got to move these wagons.

133
00:11:24,901 --> 00:11:26,120
We got to head to the Fort.

134
00:11:26,207 --> 00:11:28,775
We stay here.
That"s been decided.

135
00:11:28,862 --> 00:11:30,385
By who?!

136
00:11:30,472 --> 00:11:32,126
By the wagon boss
and my husband.

137
00:11:32,213 --> 00:11:35,259
You mean the folks who ain"t
fucking here, Margaret?

138
00:11:35,346 --> 00:11:36,739
Lakota don"t let their families

139
00:11:36,826 --> 00:11:38,349
just wander
these fucking plains...

140
00:11:38,436 --> 00:11:41,309
They "re out there huntin",
right now.

141
00:11:41,396 --> 00:11:43,276
And when they come
back here and they find this?

142
00:11:43,354 --> 00:11:44,965
They"re gonna be
fuckin" hunting us next.

143
00:11:45,052 --> 00:11:47,881
Fort Caspar"s six hour"s ride.
I"m gonna make it in four.

144
00:11:47,968 --> 00:11:51,362
Anyone that wants to join me
to the fort, saddle up. Ha!

145
00:11:51,449 --> 00:11:53,538
Let"s go!

146
00:11:55,889 --> 00:11:58,108
Wait, wait!
Wait!

147
00:12:03,592 --> 00:12:05,115
We stay here.

148
00:12:05,202 --> 00:12:06,769
Josef and Risa
need doctor anyway.

149
00:12:06,856 --> 00:12:10,033
We not wait here for their men
to show up and kill us.

150
00:12:48,942 --> 00:12:51,683
We should stay.

151
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:55,252
Better, follow daddy"s tracks
and catch up to him.

152
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:57,428
How am I supposed to
catch him in a wagon?

153
00:12:57,515 --> 00:13:00,127
Leave the wagon.

154
00:13:00,214 --> 00:13:03,173
Should I leave
your brother here, too?

155
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,481
Two women and a child
alone on the only road

156
00:13:06,568 --> 00:13:09,266
in the most dangerous country
in this nation.

157
00:13:09,353 --> 00:13:11,921
There is strength in numbers,
we have no numbers.

158
00:13:12,008 --> 00:13:13,008
We go with them.

159
00:13:14,663 --> 00:13:16,447
I think it"s a mistake.

160
00:13:16,534 --> 00:13:19,276
It"s all a mistake, Elsa.

161
00:13:19,363 --> 00:13:21,757
The right choice is luck,
that"s all.

162
00:13:24,978 --> 00:13:27,067
You need to put on a dress.

163
00:13:27,154 --> 00:13:28,720
Why?

164
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,940
Because if you ride
into that army fort

165
00:13:31,027 --> 00:13:33,551
half naked,
dressed like an Indian?

166
00:13:33,638 --> 00:13:36,424
Have not learned enough
about men on this trip?

167
00:13:36,511 --> 00:13:38,351
Then I won"t go in the fort.
I"ll stay outside.

168
00:13:39,862 --> 00:13:41,733
Grant me one less thing
to worry about.

169
00:13:54,485 --> 00:13:55,617
Come on, Joe.

170
00:14:01,275 --> 00:14:02,711
Where are they going??

171
00:14:02,798 --> 00:14:04,713
Fort.

172
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,150
We staying here?

173
00:14:07,237 --> 00:14:09,022
What do you think we should do?

174
00:14:09,109 --> 00:14:10,806
I think we should leave
these damn cattle

175
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:12,915
and run our horses to the fort
like their tail"s on fire.

176
00:14:12,939 --> 00:14:15,245
I "ve fought Indians, I ain"t
ever trying to do it again.

177
00:14:18,727 --> 00:14:20,294
All right.

178
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:47,059
Mother.

179
00:14:49,671 --> 00:14:50,671
Be right back.

180
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:10,997
I wish I had a mirror.

181
00:15:17,655 --> 00:15:18,655
So you could see yourself.

182
00:15:27,013 --> 00:15:28,231
I"m not wearing it for me.

183
00:15:33,454 --> 00:15:34,454
You can see it.

184
00:15:38,111 --> 00:15:39,351
I guess that"s all that matters.

185
00:15:56,433 --> 00:15:58,783
By God, I knew it.
I knew you was a girl.

186
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:01,264
You were aware before.

187
00:16:01,351 --> 00:16:03,136
My mother worries
about the soldiers

188
00:16:03,223 --> 00:16:04,463
seeing me dressed like a cowboy.

189
00:16:06,748 --> 00:16:09,098
You don "t dress nuthin"
like a cowboy.

190
00:16:09,185 --> 00:16:10,839
I don"t even know
what to call it,

191
00:16:10,926 --> 00:16:12,623
but I"ll tell you this...

192
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,990
suits you better
than that dress.

193
00:16:16,062 --> 00:16:18,455
How bout y"all have this
conversation on the run, huh?

194
00:17:05,415 --> 00:17:06,590
Spotted us.

195
00:17:06,677 --> 00:17:08,418
No way to sneak up
on "em out here.

196
00:17:16,252 --> 00:17:18,733
Those are Indian ponies.

197
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,779
I say we just ride
right at these fuckers.

198
00:17:21,866 --> 00:17:24,130
My God, you"re anxious
to get shot.

199
00:17:24,217 --> 00:17:25,455
I"m anxious to
get back to my family.

200
00:17:25,479 --> 00:17:26,610
I makes me anxious to shoot.

201
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,137
Here comes your chance.

202
00:17:36,229 --> 00:17:38,231
What"s your business out here?

203
00:17:38,318 --> 00:17:39,518
I could ask you the same thing.

204
00:17:40,842 --> 00:17:42,713
You Marshals?

205
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,673
Deputies, Wyoming
Stock Growers Association.

206
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,024
Wyoming ain"t a state.
Who appointed you deputies?

207
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:50,852
We appointed ourselves

208
00:17:50,939 --> 00:17:53,681
after we got sick of having
our horses and cattle stolen.

209
00:17:53,768 --> 00:17:57,206
Those don"t look
much like your horses.

210
00:17:57,293 --> 00:17:59,078
And I don"t see no cattle.

211
00:17:59,165 --> 00:18:01,515
Mister, I don"t know who
you are or where you"re from,

212
00:18:01,602 --> 00:18:03,386
but you"d better get back to it.

213
00:18:03,473 --> 00:18:06,259
We don"t waste our time
hanging rustlers around here,

214
00:18:06,346 --> 00:18:07,912
we just fucking shoot "em.

215
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,653
We have the same philosophy.

216
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,740
Is that right?

217
00:18:12,656 --> 00:18:14,919
You"re lucky to still
be sitting a horse, old man.

218
00:18:15,006 --> 00:18:17,966
Don"t let your mouth start a
fight your pistol can"t finish.

219
00:18:18,053 --> 00:18:22,275
So, you"re saying those women
and children are rustlers?

220
00:18:22,362 --> 00:18:25,016
No, their sorry men
is the rustlers,

221
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,149
and when they find
their families dead

222
00:18:27,236 --> 00:18:28,759
they"re gonna come after us

223
00:18:28,846 --> 00:18:30,805
and we are gonna give "em
the fucking business.

224
00:18:30,892 --> 00:18:33,721
You killed all those folks
just to bait their men?

225
00:18:33,808 --> 00:18:36,680
Them Indians is prairie
maggots and nothing else.

226
00:18:36,767 --> 00:18:38,813
You gotta kill "em where
you find "em like fucking...

227
00:18:43,992 --> 00:18:46,429
Y"all swing wide.
I"m gonna run right at "em.

228
00:19:06,232 --> 00:19:08,103
You ain"t no deputy.

229
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,888
You ain"t no judge,
and you ain"t no fucking jury.

230
00:19:12,716 --> 00:19:15,937
Them folks wasn"t the thieves.

231
00:19:16,024 --> 00:19:17,024
You the thief.

232
00:19:18,635 --> 00:19:19,897
And you"re gonna die for it.

233
00:20:28,096 --> 00:20:30,751
<i>The dress felt like
a prison built just for me,</i>

234
00:20:30,838 --> 00:20:32,796
<i>choking me by the neck.</i>

235
00:20:32,883 --> 00:20:34,929
<i>Digging into my underarms.</i>

236
00:20:35,016 --> 00:20:37,497
<i>Flattening my breasts
against my rib cage.</i>

237
00:20:39,412 --> 00:20:42,023
<i>It disguises everything
that makes me a woman</i>

238
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:45,548
<i>from the glare of jealous women
and rapacious men.</i>

239
00:20:45,635 --> 00:20:48,159
<i>As if their lack of
self-esteem or will power</i>

240
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,075
<i>should be my only concern.</i>

241
00:20:51,162 --> 00:20:53,513
<i>I will never live
in that world again</i>

242
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,906
<i>where the weak would
rather guilt the strong</i>

243
00:20:55,993 --> 00:20:59,997
<i>than become strong themselves.</i>

244
00:21:00,084 --> 00:21:02,783
<i>No...
I will stay in this world.</i>

245
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:06,221
<i>This world doesn"t care
what the weak want.</i>

246
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:08,528
<i>This world eats the weak...</i>

247
00:21:11,618 --> 00:21:13,291
Don"t he know we don"t know
where the hell we"re goin"?

248
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:14,882
I"ll tell him.

249
00:22:01,581 --> 00:22:03,104
Jesus.

250
00:22:51,805 --> 00:22:52,805
Whoa...

251
00:22:54,634 --> 00:22:56,026
- Circle the wagons!
- Circle!

252
00:22:56,113 --> 00:22:57,811
- Circle the wagons!
- Circle!

253
00:22:57,898 --> 00:22:59,682
- Right here!
- Circle "em!

254
00:22:59,769 --> 00:23:01,292
Circle the goddamn wagons!

255
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,382
- Right here, right here!
- Circle them!

256
00:23:03,469 --> 00:23:05,558
Come up, come up, come up!

257
00:23:14,262 --> 00:23:15,382
Hey, not too close together!

258
00:23:15,437 --> 00:23:16,656
They"ll burn them!

259
00:23:16,743 --> 00:23:18,527
Hold each horse,
hold them in the middle.

260
00:23:18,614 --> 00:23:22,662
Stop fucking staring at them.
Get over here, come on.

261
00:23:22,749 --> 00:23:24,403
Get low, get to a safe place.

262
00:23:28,015 --> 00:23:29,843
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

263
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:30,974
Do I hide now, mama?

264
00:23:31,061 --> 00:23:32,301
Come on, baby, you come with me.

265
00:23:33,629 --> 00:23:35,152
- Go.
- Stay right there.

266
00:23:35,239 --> 00:23:36,980
Get down, find cover!

267
00:23:37,067 --> 00:23:39,809
What do we do about them?

268
00:23:39,896 --> 00:23:41,856
They made their choice.
They"re gonna die with it.

269
00:23:43,857 --> 00:23:44,901
Get down!

270
00:23:48,818 --> 00:23:50,056
Wait for it,
they"re too far away.

271
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,560
Come on, baby.

272
00:23:54,128 --> 00:23:56,130
Come on!

273
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,874
<i>There was no time to think.</i>

274
00:24:00,961 --> 00:24:03,572
<i>No time to decide
the right thing.</i>

275
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:08,882
<i>Best I could hope is maybe
some of them would follow me,</i>

276
00:24:08,969 --> 00:24:10,369
<i>and the wagons would
have a chance.</i>

277
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,079
Aim for the horse.
You"ll never hit the rider.

278
00:24:21,242 --> 00:24:22,286
Goddamnit!

279
00:24:22,373 --> 00:24:24,027
It"s too far.
Even for that.

280
00:24:24,114 --> 00:24:25,794
They"re almost on us.
Fire when I say fire.

281
00:24:31,992 --> 00:24:33,123
Fire!

282
00:24:55,972 --> 00:24:58,061
Damn it!

283
00:25:56,119 --> 00:25:57,207
Where are the wagons?

284
00:25:58,295 --> 00:26:00,341
Hell if I know.

285
00:26:21,492 --> 00:26:23,582
- Captain...
- Yeah.

286
00:26:23,669 --> 00:26:24,669
Goddammit.

287
00:29:07,615 --> 00:29:08,615
I said no.

288
00:29:10,052 --> 00:29:12,054
Will you let me go?

289
00:29:12,141 --> 00:29:14,709
I will sell you.

290
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:15,841
Or I will kill you.

291
00:29:15,928 --> 00:29:17,190
You speak English.

292
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:21,237
How can you do this?

293
00:29:21,324 --> 00:29:24,110
You speak English.
I know your people do this.

294
00:29:57,926 --> 00:29:59,580
Why do you know those words?

295
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:01,712
My husband taught me.

296
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,323
Why he know them?

297
00:30:05,107 --> 00:30:06,761
He"s Comanche.

298
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,200
They"re his words.

299
00:30:11,287 --> 00:30:13,246
You fight like Comanche.

300
00:30:35,007 --> 00:30:36,087
We didn"t kill your family.

301
00:30:38,097 --> 00:30:39,097
We found them.

302
00:30:41,056 --> 00:30:43,493
My father is hunting
their killers right now.

303
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:47,497
And if he"s hunting them,
he"ll find them.

304
00:30:51,023 --> 00:30:52,502
What"s your name?

305
00:31:01,468 --> 00:31:02,556
Good name.

306
00:31:32,716 --> 00:31:36,764
<i>I felt no pain.</i>

307
00:31:36,851 --> 00:31:40,681
<i>Perhaps it was the fever of
the fight, but it didn"t hurt.</i>

308
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,034
<i>I thought of pushing it through,</i>

309
00:31:46,121 --> 00:31:47,253
<i>but thought better of it.</i>

310
00:31:50,125 --> 00:31:55,348
<i>As my father would say, the
one good thing about problems</i>

311
00:31:55,435 --> 00:31:58,525
<i>is they"ll still
be problems later.</i>

312
00:31:58,612 --> 00:32:00,212
<i>Don"t have to deal
with them right away.</i>

313
00:32:24,203 --> 00:32:25,639
My God.

314
00:32:25,726 --> 00:32:27,075
- Whoa.
- Jesus.

315
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:38,869
Oh, honey.

316
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,045
It"s okay.

317
00:32:40,132 --> 00:32:41,350
We need to get her to the fort.

318
00:32:41,437 --> 00:32:42,699
She needs to see a surgeon.

319
00:32:42,786 --> 00:32:43,894
We gotta get that
arrow out right now,

320
00:32:43,918 --> 00:32:45,137
or she"ll fuse to it.

321
00:32:45,224 --> 00:32:45,746
Let"s get her
to the wagons first.

322
00:32:45,833 --> 00:32:47,443
Y"all go on ahead.

323
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:48,768
I"ll see if anyone else
made it through.

324
00:32:48,792 --> 00:32:51,534
Okay, it"s okay.

325
00:32:51,621 --> 00:32:52,861
Baby, we"ll take you, it"s okay.

326
00:33:42,411 --> 00:33:43,586
Ma"am?

327
00:33:45,501 --> 00:33:46,501
Ma"am!

328
00:33:50,419 --> 00:33:53,031
Ma"am.

329
00:33:53,118 --> 00:33:55,163
Ma "am, it"s over.

330
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,250
Ma"am.

331
00:34:00,603 --> 00:34:02,866
Ah!

332
00:34:02,953 --> 00:34:06,044
Ma"am. Look at me...

333
00:34:06,131 --> 00:34:08,002
Can you tell me your name?

334
00:34:08,089 --> 00:34:09,089
Do you remember it?

335
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,030
I don "t know the Lord"s
prayer...

336
00:34:20,667 --> 00:34:22,234
but if there is a God,

337
00:34:25,237 --> 00:34:27,477
He will not keep you out of
Heaven for what I don"t know.

338
00:34:31,025 --> 00:34:35,421
You deserve peace,
and this ain"t it.

339
00:35:32,217 --> 00:35:34,436
This is gonna hurt.

340
00:35:34,523 --> 00:35:36,612
It don"t hurt, I"m telling you.

341
00:35:36,699 --> 00:35:38,788
Grab my hand and squeeze.

342
00:35:38,875 --> 00:35:40,529
It"s fine.

343
00:35:43,706 --> 00:35:46,100
You all right?

344
00:35:46,187 --> 00:35:48,102
It don"t hurt, I"m telling you.

345
00:35:48,189 --> 00:35:49,843
Where"s the bandages?
Give me one.

346
00:35:52,628 --> 00:35:56,458
When I pull this, she"s gonna
bleed like I turned on a faucet.

347
00:35:56,545 --> 00:35:58,982
Press against the wound
tight after I pull it.

348
00:35:59,069 --> 00:36:00,375
- Ready?
- Yes.

349
00:36:00,462 --> 00:36:01,507
It"s fine, just pull it.

350
00:36:03,813 --> 00:36:05,250
Fire, fire.

351
00:36:11,081 --> 00:36:15,477
Move it, move it!

352
00:36:15,564 --> 00:36:17,218
Wrap it tight.

353
00:36:20,482 --> 00:36:21,483
You"ve done this before.

354
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:22,789
Not for an arrow.

355
00:36:22,876 --> 00:36:25,792
- You nursed in the war?
- Who didn"t.

356
00:36:25,879 --> 00:36:27,279
Cover.
Help me get her in the wagon.

357
00:36:46,378 --> 00:36:48,162
That"s too many to face.

358
00:36:48,249 --> 00:36:50,817
If we can get to the mountains,
we can lose "em in the timber.

359
00:36:50,904 --> 00:36:52,166
Can"t run.

360
00:36:52,253 --> 00:36:53,776
My family"s out there.

361
00:36:55,691 --> 00:36:58,172
Let"s hope
they made it to the fort.

362
00:36:58,259 --> 00:37:00,348
I don"t hope.
I gotta know.

363
00:37:11,881 --> 00:37:13,927
What do we do?

364
00:37:14,014 --> 00:37:16,364
Committing suicide ain"t
get anyone to Oregon.

365
00:37:17,496 --> 00:37:19,585
I still hope.

366
00:37:19,672 --> 00:37:21,672
I talk you out of committing
suicide every morning.

367
00:37:25,286 --> 00:37:27,941
We did not suffer our way
all this way not to make it.

368
00:37:28,028 --> 00:37:29,812
Someone made it.

369
00:37:29,899 --> 00:37:33,816
We"ll find them
and we"ll take them all the way.

370
00:37:33,903 --> 00:37:35,253
All the goddam way.

371
00:37:49,571 --> 00:37:51,704
Your daughter is
the yellow hair.

372
00:37:51,791 --> 00:37:52,791
Yeah.

373
00:37:54,707 --> 00:37:56,883
You act like Comanche too.

374
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:58,188
I"m from Tennessee.

375
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,842
I don"t know Tennessee.

376
00:38:02,192 --> 00:38:03,392
It ain"t worth knowing anymore.

377
00:38:06,327 --> 00:38:09,243
Your daughter said you were
hunting my family"s killers.

378
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:12,246
I hunted them and I killed them.

379
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:14,901
I left them in the sagebrush
so you can scalp "em

380
00:38:14,988 --> 00:38:17,469
or do whatever you want.

381
00:38:17,556 --> 00:38:19,775
Your horses are
grazing by the river.

382
00:38:19,862 --> 00:38:21,623
We didn"t touch your dead
"cause I don"t know your God.

383
00:38:21,647 --> 00:38:22,909
I don"t know his rules...

384
00:38:22,996 --> 00:38:24,867
Our God has no rules.

385
00:38:24,954 --> 00:38:28,131
Only ceremonies
to know him better.

386
00:38:28,218 --> 00:38:30,917
But no rules.

387
00:38:31,004 --> 00:38:32,310
Do I still have a family?

388
00:38:34,355 --> 00:38:35,593
I don"t know
which is your family.

389
00:38:35,617 --> 00:38:36,705
Do I still have a daughter?

390
00:38:40,709 --> 00:38:41,884
Do I?

391
00:38:44,452 --> 00:38:45,452
No more fighting today.

392
00:38:48,238 --> 00:38:50,763
Their tracks led from the
bodies of my family.

393
00:38:52,286 --> 00:38:55,463
My wife, children.
My mother.

394
00:38:56,943 --> 00:38:58,336
We made war on your people.

395
00:38:59,946 --> 00:39:01,426
And your daughter stopped it.

396
00:39:01,513 --> 00:39:02,513
How did she stop it?

397
00:39:04,516 --> 00:39:05,821
By being the best
warrior of all.

398
00:39:08,824 --> 00:39:11,740
There are surgeons at the fort.
Take her there.

399
00:39:11,827 --> 00:39:12,959
And pray.

400
00:39:14,177 --> 00:39:15,875
I"ll pray too.

401
00:39:27,887 --> 00:39:29,149
Hya!

402
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,476
How you feeling?

403
00:40:36,999 --> 00:40:38,914
My head hurts.

404
00:40:39,001 --> 00:40:41,308
From falling off the horse.

405
00:40:43,092 --> 00:40:45,312
You fell off a horse?

406
00:40:45,399 --> 00:40:46,444
Got knocked off, I guess.

407
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,014
I got shot with an arrow.

408
00:40:54,321 --> 00:40:55,321
I"m aware.

409
00:40:57,193 --> 00:40:58,499
I told mama to save it.

410
00:40:59,892 --> 00:41:02,242
Don"t let her throw it away.

411
00:41:02,329 --> 00:41:03,722
I wanna show Sam.

412
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:05,810
We"ll save it, honey.

413
00:41:13,209 --> 00:41:14,994
It don"t hurt that bad, daddy. Really.

414
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:23,263
Look, you act like a man

415
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:24,588
so I"m gonna
talk to you like a man,

416
00:41:24,612 --> 00:41:25,772
I"m gonna tell you the truth.

417
00:41:29,791 --> 00:41:31,619
It don"t matter
how much it hurts,

418
00:41:31,706 --> 00:41:37,451
what matters is
if it gets infected.

419
00:41:37,538 --> 00:41:39,978
And the way you can tell it"s
infected is if you have a fever.

420
00:41:41,977 --> 00:41:43,936
What do I do if I get a fever?

421
00:41:44,023 --> 00:41:45,633
There ain"t much we can do here.

422
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,461
We got to get you to the fort.

423
00:41:47,548 --> 00:41:49,594
What can they do at the fort?

424
00:41:49,681 --> 00:41:51,987
They got medicines for fever.

425
00:41:52,074 --> 00:41:56,209
Willow bark tea,
opium for the pain.

426
00:41:56,296 --> 00:41:57,689
You can sweat it out in a bath.

427
00:42:01,127 --> 00:42:02,520
And we can pray.

428
00:42:05,174 --> 00:42:07,089
You don"t pray.

429
00:42:07,176 --> 00:42:10,528
I"ve prayed plenty.

430
00:42:10,615 --> 00:42:11,659
It just ain"t worked.

431
00:42:18,448 --> 00:42:21,321
I"m fine, daddy.

432
00:42:21,408 --> 00:42:22,714
I don"t have a fever.

433
00:42:24,803 --> 00:42:25,803
It don"t hurt.

434
00:42:28,023 --> 00:42:29,938
You just try and sleep
and be still.

435
00:42:32,419 --> 00:42:34,160
They can cauterize
the outside of you,

436
00:42:34,247 --> 00:42:37,816
but time"s the only thing
that can stitch the inside.

437
00:43:28,736 --> 00:43:31,130
I need a fucking shovel.

438
00:43:31,217 --> 00:43:33,393
Ground"s so fucking hard...

439
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,560
Been digging for an hour
and it"s barely a foot deep.

440
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:37,615
I"ll find you a shovel.

441
00:43:41,488 --> 00:43:42,750
She"d gone mad.

442
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:46,493
Wild, like a rabid dog.

443
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:48,277
Scalped her...

444
00:43:48,364 --> 00:43:49,864
Killed her husband,
stuck her full of arrows.

445
00:43:49,888 --> 00:43:52,630
What was I supposed to do, huh?

446
00:43:52,717 --> 00:43:55,197
Leave her there to suffer and
take three days to die?!

447
00:43:55,284 --> 00:43:57,373
You did the right thing.

448
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:59,114
I know.

449
00:43:59,201 --> 00:44:00,201
It just...

450
00:44:03,336 --> 00:44:04,729
It don"t feel right.

451
00:44:11,431 --> 00:44:13,259
She snarled at me like a coyote.

452
00:44:15,261 --> 00:44:16,479
And I fucking shot her.

453
00:44:18,917 --> 00:44:21,528
Don"t do that.

454
00:44:21,615 --> 00:44:24,357
You made a decision.

455
00:44:24,444 --> 00:44:25,844
You did what you
thought was decent.

456
00:44:27,795 --> 00:44:28,795
Was it decent?

457
00:44:30,537 --> 00:44:32,800
Who knows.

458
00:44:32,887 --> 00:44:36,978
What the hell is decent
out here, what"s the gauge?

459
00:44:40,329 --> 00:44:41,853
You"re the gauge.

460
00:44:45,421 --> 00:44:46,684
You made a decision.

461
00:44:48,337 --> 00:44:49,337
Now stand by it.

462
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:53,168
Right or wrong,
you fucking stand by it.

463
00:45:05,137 --> 00:45:06,137
Okay.

464
00:45:12,144 --> 00:45:13,624
It was the best thing
I thought to do.

465
00:45:17,671 --> 00:45:18,671
I stand by it.

466
00:45:20,805 --> 00:45:22,894
I"ll find you a shovel.

467
00:45:22,981 --> 00:45:24,156
And I"ll help you use it.

468
00:46:08,548 --> 00:46:10,811
Where"s John?

469
00:46:10,898 --> 00:46:13,466
Thomas took him to sleep
in one of the other wagons.

470
00:46:21,604 --> 00:46:22,604
How bad was it?

471
00:46:23,998 --> 00:46:26,044
The blood was dark.

472
00:46:26,131 --> 00:46:27,959
From the liver.

473
00:46:28,046 --> 00:46:30,439
Arrow clipped it for sure.

474
00:46:30,526 --> 00:46:31,527
Who knows how bad?

475
00:46:33,878 --> 00:46:37,533
But she"s young
and she"s strong...

476
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:38,620
I know.

477
00:46:56,117 --> 00:46:57,117
Walk with me, honey.

478
00:47:10,958 --> 00:47:13,831
You were a nurse in the war.

479
00:47:13,918 --> 00:47:14,918
So?

480
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,839
So, how many liver shots
did you see survive?

481
00:47:21,926 --> 00:47:23,362
We got it out fast, James.

482
00:47:26,017 --> 00:47:27,017
Let me see it.

483
00:47:40,814 --> 00:47:42,250
It"s filthy, honey.

484
00:47:43,643 --> 00:47:45,210
She"s young.

485
00:47:45,297 --> 00:47:46,951
She"s young and she"s so strong.

486
00:47:47,038 --> 00:47:50,519
And she"s the light of
my life and she"s my soul...

487
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:00,486
She"s gonna die.

488
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:07,667
How fucking dare you?

489
00:48:07,754 --> 00:48:10,322
I will not lose a child.

490
00:48:11,932 --> 00:48:13,629
I will not lose a...

491
00:48:17,851 --> 00:48:21,420
She"s gonna die

492
00:48:21,507 --> 00:48:23,030
and it"s gonna cut us in two,

493
00:48:25,293 --> 00:48:26,686
and if we don"t accept it now

494
00:48:26,773 --> 00:48:31,256
she"ll die in some fort
with some doctor

495
00:48:31,343 --> 00:48:35,434
doping her up so badly
she can"t see straight,

496
00:48:35,521 --> 00:48:37,218
then we will have robbed her.

497
00:48:40,395 --> 00:48:43,398
She needs to see every sunrise
and every sunset.

498
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:50,057
And we will lie to her, and
we will tell her she"s fine.

499
00:48:53,017 --> 00:48:56,020
And we will let her
look at this world

500
00:48:56,107 --> 00:48:57,267
with those big, dreamer eyes,

501
00:49:00,459 --> 00:49:01,619
"till they can" t see anymore.

502
00:49:03,157 --> 00:49:05,029
And then what are we gonna do?

503
00:49:06,987 --> 00:49:10,251
She"s gonna be another cross
on a trail that we don"t visit.

504
00:49:13,254 --> 00:49:17,998
Ten years from now,
it"s just... gone?

505
00:49:18,085 --> 00:49:20,609
Our wagon drive is over.

506
00:49:20,696 --> 00:49:23,351
Where we bury her
is where we stay.

507
00:49:23,438 --> 00:49:25,310
That is our home.

508
00:49:25,397 --> 00:49:27,790
Not here.
Not in this place.

509
00:49:29,792 --> 00:49:31,881
No. Not in this place.

510
00:49:33,448 --> 00:49:35,929
I will find the place.

511
00:49:36,016 --> 00:49:37,278
By God, I will find a place.

512
00:50:05,915 --> 00:50:07,265
I need a minute.

513
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:57,140
You ready?

514
00:50:58,664 --> 00:50:59,926
We"re ready.

515
00:51:00,013 --> 00:51:01,971
How"s your lady?

516
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:03,582
Who says she"s my lady?

517
00:51:04,931 --> 00:51:06,324
How"s your lady?

518
00:51:09,805 --> 00:51:11,285
She lived through it, Captain.

519
00:51:13,635 --> 00:51:16,899
You will get tough or die in
this country, that"s for sure.

520
00:51:16,986 --> 00:51:20,425
If we can make it to Oregon,

521
00:51:20,512 --> 00:51:22,352
you won"t be able to cut
her skin with a knife.

522
00:51:29,912 --> 00:51:32,132
How are you feeling?

523
00:51:32,219 --> 00:51:33,699
Like I got a fever.

524
00:51:38,747 --> 00:51:40,140
You feel fine to me.

525
00:51:42,621 --> 00:51:43,621
Can you sit up?

526
00:51:52,587 --> 00:51:53,587
Sore?

527
00:51:58,767 --> 00:52:00,334
Hurts today.

528
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:03,729
I bet.

529
00:52:03,816 --> 00:52:07,385
Come ride on the buckboard.

530
00:52:07,472 --> 00:52:10,388
This wagon will absolutely
tear you to pieces back here.

531
00:52:13,042 --> 00:52:14,174
I"d rather ride.

532
00:52:16,437 --> 00:52:18,352
Can I ride?

533
00:52:18,439 --> 00:52:19,439
Sure, honey.
You can ride.

534
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:23,966
I"m wearing pants.

535
00:52:24,053 --> 00:52:26,447
I don"t give a shit what
they say at the fort.

536
00:52:26,534 --> 00:52:28,145
Wear whatever you want.

537
00:52:39,721 --> 00:52:41,482
I figured you wouldn"t want
to be churned like buttermilk

538
00:52:41,506 --> 00:52:43,508
in the back of that thing.

539
00:52:56,521 --> 00:52:57,783
Swing your leg over slow.

540
00:53:08,663 --> 00:53:10,230
Didn"t hurt at all yesterday.

541
00:53:13,886 --> 00:53:16,149
Guess it saved all
the pain for today.

542
00:53:16,236 --> 00:53:18,238
The day after"s always worse.

543
00:53:18,325 --> 00:53:19,325
What about the next day?

544
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:22,720
The next day"s a mystery.

545
00:53:45,004 --> 00:53:48,355
<i>I looked at my father,
looked past his smile.</i>

546
00:53:50,749 --> 00:53:51,749
<i>Saw his worry.</i>

547
00:53:53,665 --> 00:53:56,494
<i>Saw something deeper.</i>

548
00:53:56,581 --> 00:53:58,060
<i>As if he were
already in mourning.</i>

549
00:54:03,457 --> 00:54:05,024
<i>As if I were already gone.</i>

550
00:54:18,342 --> 00:54:20,822
<i>I felt different too,</i>

551
00:54:20,909 --> 00:54:23,129
<i>felt as though my soul
had been dislodged</i>

552
00:54:23,216 --> 00:54:25,523
<i>from whatever
cavern in our chest</i>

553
00:54:25,610 --> 00:54:28,177
<i>the soul is connected to.</i>

554
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:30,745
<i>It felt loose.</i>

555
00:54:30,832 --> 00:54:33,661
<i>Disconnected.</i>

556
00:54:33,748 --> 00:54:36,229
<i>I looked out at the sagebrush.</i>

557
00:54:36,316 --> 00:54:37,926
<i>The colors looked different.</i>

558
00:54:38,013 --> 00:54:40,668
<i>Sharper.</i>

559
00:54:40,755 --> 00:54:43,454
<i>Looked up at the sky.</i>

560
00:54:43,541 --> 00:54:46,370
<i>The clouds seemed
to race above us,</i>

561
00:54:46,457 --> 00:54:49,286
<i>as if new rules applied
to time and space above me.</i>

562
00:54:54,769 --> 00:54:58,556
<i>I looked back at my father,
and I studied his eyes.</i>

563
00:55:02,037 --> 00:55:03,343
<i>Looked deep into them.</i>

564
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:14,572
<i>That"s when I knew
I was going to die.</i>
