1
00:00:25,493 --> 00:00:30,029
We moved towards Doan's
Crossing and the Red River.

2
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,801
And tragedy's next opportunity
to ravage what's left of us...

3
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,207
My mother says
the pain will fade.

4
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:42,942
And the good memories
will return.

5
00:00:42,943 --> 00:00:44,878
I suppose that's true.

6
00:00:46,447 --> 00:00:49,716
Every person on this planet
will endure this pain

7
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:51,885
until they are the cause
of it for another.

8
00:00:53,321 --> 00:00:56,457
Someday, I'll die
and shatter hearts, too.

9
00:00:58,326 --> 00:01:01,294
But that is not today.

10
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:04,332
Today I am living
and I'm the shattered.

11
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:27,120
Oughta try and hire
a cowboy away from 'em.

12
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:28,888
And a cook.

13
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:31,558
Can't mess with
an outfit's cook.

14
00:01:31,559 --> 00:01:34,561
You steal their cattle
and they wouldn't be madder.

15
00:01:34,562 --> 00:01:38,165
I ain't looking for
a gun fight this morning.

16
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:41,702
We'll hire a cook and a cowboy
going the other way at Doan's.

17
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:47,006
How's she doing?

18
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:48,509
About how you'd expect.

19
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:48,601
You hungry?

20
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:50,437
No.

21
00:02:50,438 --> 00:02:51,604
Where are you going?

22
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:54,341
I need some privacy.

23
00:02:54,342 --> 00:02:55,543
Why do you need privacy?

24
00:02:58,279 --> 00:02:59,580
I got my period.

25
00:03:12,293 --> 00:03:13,694
Death is everywhere.

26
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:19,065
It follows us like a stray dog,

27
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:21,269
waiting to devour
us like scraps.

28
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:29,610
The pain it causes
is so acute, so complete...

29
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:37,285
It's hard to understand how
it benefits us, as a species.

30
00:03:42,356 --> 00:03:44,057
What purpose does pain serve?

31
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:50,163
I understand desire and fear...

32
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,934
And love...

33
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:58,004
And how they protect us
and better our lives

34
00:03:58,005 --> 00:04:01,774
and bring new life.

35
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:02,876
But grief...

36
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:09,650
If I weren't so consumed by it,
it would baffle me.

37
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:28,168
I know how you feel.

38
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,439
A lot of people
are gonna tell you that.

39
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:36,310
Whether it's the truth
or not, I don't know.

40
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,348
But I know it's true
when I say it.

41
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:45,151
I have sat right
where you're sitting,

42
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:46,520
thinking the same thing.

43
00:04:47,855 --> 00:04:49,557
Thinking I don't want
to live without them.

44
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:52,459
Don't see the point.

45
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,828
Still do most days.

46
00:04:58,265 --> 00:05:02,302
But here I am...
living without them.

47
00:05:04,872 --> 00:05:06,407
Why?

48
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,709
Well...

49
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,245
My reasons'd be
different than yours.

50
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:16,283
I don't have anyone
left who loves me.

51
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,620
You do.

52
00:05:26,494 --> 00:05:27,828
I'll tell you a secret.

53
00:05:39,507 --> 00:05:41,942
I'll tell you why
I'm still sucking air today.

54
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:46,780
I'm headed to the ocean.

55
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:52,119
The ocean?

56
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:59,026
An Apache scout
told me once...

57
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:04,432
that when you love somebody,
you trade souls with them.

58
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:10,438
They get a piece of yours,
and you get a piece of theirs.

59
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:16,477
But when your love dies...

60
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:23,083
A little piece
of you dies with them.

61
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:28,255
That's why you hurt so bad.

62
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,526
But that little piece
of him is still inside you.

63
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:39,567
And he can use your eyes
to see the world.

64
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,871
So...

65
00:06:44,872 --> 00:06:46,907
I'm taking my wife
to the ocean...

66
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,746
And I'm gonna sit on
the beach, and let her see it.

67
00:06:56,584 --> 00:06:57,818
That was her dream.

68
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,022
Then I'm going to see her.

69
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:05,959
That's my dream.

70
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:17,771
In the meantime, the herd
could sure use its cowgirl.

71
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:23,671
Where you going now?

72
00:08:30,277 --> 00:08:31,344
Back to work.

73
00:10:08,175 --> 00:10:09,376
Let's hold the herd up here.

74
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:17,484
James: Hold 'em up!

75
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:52,752
If you need something from the
traders, I'll get it for you.

76
00:10:52,753 --> 00:10:56,155
You stay here
and keep them kids close.

77
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,916
There's as many thieves
as traders out there.

78
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:07,399
My husband's things.
I have to sell them.

79
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,103
Yes, ma'am, I'll get 'em sold.

80
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:12,773
Thank you.

81
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:20,512
Don't sell that shotgun.

82
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,582
- I don't know how to use it.
- I can teach you to use it.

83
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,352
You're gonna need it.

84
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:44,103
I wonder
if they got dairy cows.

85
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:46,338
Cause I'd like some milk.

86
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:48,540
Milk will spoil.

87
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,977
The way this damn
wagon rattles,

88
00:11:50,978 --> 00:11:52,679
milk will be butter
in an afternoon.

89
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:57,483
Grab some more coffee
too, would you?

90
00:11:57,484 --> 00:12:00,453
Take John. I'd like
to spend some time with Elsa.

91
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,257
All right, come on, son.

92
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:07,127
Here we go.

93
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:13,766
Don't let those traders
swindle you.

94
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:15,635
I plan on doing the swindling.

95
00:12:17,004 --> 00:12:18,004
I'll bet.

96
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:32,219
Ride with me.

97
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:37,023
Gotta watch the herd.

98
00:12:37,024 --> 00:12:38,490
The first decent
grass these cattle

99
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:39,691
have seen in a week.

100
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:40,994
The cattle will be fine.

101
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:43,430
Wade!

102
00:12:46,033 --> 00:12:49,301
I'm gonna take her
to the trading post.

103
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:51,170
Do you need anything?

104
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:52,972
Well...

105
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:54,573
I wouldn't be mad
at a chocolate bar,

106
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:55,876
if they happen to have one.

107
00:12:57,144 --> 00:12:58,878
If they have one, I'll buy it.

108
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,347
Much appreciated.

109
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:03,783
Come on.

110
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:53,766
What?

111
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,969
What!

112
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,204
You's what.

113
00:13:58,205 --> 00:14:00,106
It's a free country.

114
00:14:00,107 --> 00:14:02,041
I can look at whatever I want.

115
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:06,013
Judging by the way you're
dressed, you don't mind it.

116
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,782
I mind it.

117
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:12,886
What are you going
to do about it?

118
00:14:15,923 --> 00:14:17,623
I like this one.

119
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:18,825
Let me see.

120
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,761
You've got expensive taste, boy.

121
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:23,830
James!

122
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:28,301
You gonna shoot me,
little girl?

123
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:33,040
Goddam right I am.

124
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,409
It's harder to do
than you think.

125
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,978
No, it ain't.

126
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:40,547
It comes real natural to me.

127
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:46,618
Look, we was just funnin'
and she pulls iron.

128
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:48,520
I guess she wasn't
having too much fun.

129
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:52,358
All right. All right.

130
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:55,394
Just... I put it down, okay?

131
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:56,862
I put it down.

132
00:14:56,863 --> 00:14:58,397
James.

133
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,132
I don't wanna waste looking
over my shoulder for you.

134
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:02,301
You won't find us if you do.

135
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:03,970
We's headed to Fort Worth.

136
00:15:03,971 --> 00:15:05,605
Well, I'd be headed that way.

137
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:25,925
What is wrong with you?

138
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,361
Give it to me.

139
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:34,001
You don't point this at anyone
unless you plan on using it.

140
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,170
I was gonna use it.

141
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:43,743
Go to camp,
and you wait there!

142
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:34,393
Whoo! Pretty short fuse
on that girl.

143
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:36,462
It's not long.

144
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:39,965
Some of them cowgirls
is ranker than the cowboys.

145
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:42,035
Like they ain't
never had a mother.

146
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,571
I'm her mother.

147
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:50,210
Would you like a lemonade?

148
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:52,812
I would not, thank you.

149
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:58,085
How bout a whiskey punch?

150
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:03,790
You look like you could use it.

151
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:09,895
Would you join me?

152
00:17:11,398 --> 00:17:15,435
Sister, I been joining you
since noon.

153
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:26,512
Ice.

154
00:17:26,513 --> 00:17:29,481
My husband bought a block
in Fort Worth in January.

155
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:32,218
Got the ice box down our well.

156
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:33,785
Hundred pound block
will last till June

157
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:36,288
if we don't get in there much.
Mm.

158
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:37,423
This is the last of it

159
00:17:37,424 --> 00:17:39,126
and I ain't letting one
bit go to waste.

160
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:00,447
Sorry. Thank you.

161
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:03,816
Children can have that effect.

162
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:05,985
Mine sure did.

163
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:24,536
How was it?

164
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,881
Not worth going.

165
00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:38,084
They never are.

166
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:45,958
Stars for a blanket.

167
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:49,996
Ground for a bed.

168
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:56,636
Good horse, open country.

169
00:18:58,271 --> 00:18:59,806
That's all a cowboy needs.

170
00:19:02,209 --> 00:19:03,876
Guess it's all
a cowgirl needs too.

171
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:20,726
Oregon?

172
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:21,728
Yep.

173
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:28,133
Mmmm.

174
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:32,304
Once I get there how the hell
am I supposed to get back?

175
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:36,007
We'll put your wagon
and horses on a train

176
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,044
and send you
wherever you want to go.

177
00:19:41,481 --> 00:19:43,216
Why can't they cook
for themselves?

178
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:47,220
Can't do much
of nothing for themselves.

179
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:51,690
Which way you going?

180
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:52,931
We'll cut through South Pass,

181
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:58,264
Drop into Salt Lake,
and head west from there.

182
00:19:58,265 --> 00:20:00,131
You won't beat the winter.

183
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:01,132
We'll beat it.

184
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,604
What about beef?

185
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:07,473
Hmm? You got beef?

186
00:20:07,474 --> 00:20:09,554
'Cause there ain't shit
for game once you hit Kansas.

187
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,011
Fifty head.

188
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:16,182
What else you gonna do?

189
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,859
You buy the supplies

190
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,729
and I'm hundred fifty a month,
plus the freight home.

191
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,531
Deal.

192
00:20:32,532 --> 00:20:37,168
It's my chuck wagon,
so it's my rules.

193
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:38,770
They eat what I cook.

194
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:41,072
If they don't like it they
can complain to somebody else

195
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,609
'cause I don't wanna
fucking hear it.

196
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:47,113
Your wagon, your rules.

197
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:53,819
Gonna cost about...

198
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,087
six hundred to stock up.

199
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:58,457
Why six hundred?

200
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,793
'Cause this is the last store
'fore we get to Wyoming.

201
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:04,731
What about Abilene?

202
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:10,602
God damn Abilene.

203
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:13,171
Hookers and killers
is all you'll find there.

204
00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:14,541
I ain't going near
that sum bitch.

205
00:21:16,343 --> 00:21:17,410
Mm-mmm.

206
00:21:35,495 --> 00:21:38,398
Oh, Lord Jesus, be with me.

207
00:21:54,947 --> 00:21:58,950
You know, there's going
to be a school here next year.

208
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:02,388
Ten years there wasn't nothing,

209
00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:04,890
not a soul in this country.
Mm.

210
00:22:04,891 --> 00:22:06,825
And now there's gonna
be a school.

211
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,827
That's progress.

212
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:11,297
I'm not even sure I know
what that word means anymore.

213
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,305
Nobody does!

214
00:22:31,418 --> 00:22:32,519
Miss Carol?

215
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:36,955
Miss Carol, I need to supply up!

216
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:40,693
Write down what you take.
I'll be there in a minute.

217
00:22:43,262 --> 00:22:45,331
Write down what you take?

218
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,036
All right!

219
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:15,794
Give you 35 dollars
for all of it.

220
00:23:15,795 --> 00:23:18,930
- I'll take it.
- All right.

221
00:23:18,931 --> 00:23:20,699
You want cash
or you wanna trade?

222
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,868
Cash.

223
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:24,003
All right.

224
00:23:39,552 --> 00:23:41,053
Pretty.

225
00:23:42,622 --> 00:23:45,724
Uh-huh. From France.

226
00:23:45,725 --> 00:23:48,326
What you doing with it?

227
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:49,961
Mister, if you ain't got money

228
00:23:49,962 --> 00:23:51,963
and you ain't got
beans or coffee

229
00:23:51,964 --> 00:23:54,800
or a pot to boil it in,
people will trade away anything.

230
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:57,268
Further away you get
from concrete,

231
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,205
the more worthless
those pretty things become.

232
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:04,309
How much for it?

233
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:07,112
- Fifty dollars.
- Fifty dollars?

234
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:09,748
Ain't no damn concrete
'round here.

235
00:24:09,749 --> 00:24:12,885
'Cause when I take it to
the concrete it's worth 50.

236
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:16,623
Tell you what.

237
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,160
Here's 15.

238
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,232
Keep that 35 and we're even.

239
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:48,887
All the way
to Oregon with them?

240
00:24:48,888 --> 00:24:51,222
That's the plan.

241
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:54,225
Who taught 'em how
to hitch a wagon?

242
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:57,629
These folks
are a work in progress.

243
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:00,099
Well, I'd say
you ain't there yet.

244
00:25:02,569 --> 00:25:03,570
Nope.

245
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:07,973
You all have any trouble
with bandits?

246
00:25:07,974 --> 00:25:10,508
We had our share.

247
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,210
How'd they handle it?

248
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:14,913
They're here aren't they?

249
00:25:14,914 --> 00:25:16,848
It's gonna get worse.

250
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:19,851
And once you get to Wyoming?

251
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:21,252
Every sorry bastard on this
earth is hid out

252
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:22,954
in that son of a bitch.

253
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:25,691
And the Indians ain't as tame
as the papers say they is.

254
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:27,325
So people keep telling me.

255
00:25:27,326 --> 00:25:31,229
Look, Captain...

256
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,998
I been in my fair share
of gunfights

257
00:25:32,999 --> 00:25:37,002
and I ain't trying
to get in another one.

258
00:25:37,003 --> 00:25:38,370
I ju... I don't...

259
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:44,110
Hundred a month you say?

260
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:48,914
Yep.

261
00:25:48,915 --> 00:25:50,916
How's the food?

262
00:25:50,917 --> 00:25:53,184
If we can get Cookie hired
it's the same food

263
00:25:53,185 --> 00:25:54,620
you been eatin'.

264
00:25:54,621 --> 00:25:55,861
I'll ride the trail with you.

265
00:25:57,523 --> 00:25:59,958
Grab yourgear.
Toss it in that second wagon.

266
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:02,061
Well, everything I own
is strapped to this saddle.

267
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:11,236
I thought you was working
with Swenson?

268
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:14,039
We're riding a herd
up in March.

269
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,675
How are them rivers?

270
00:26:16,676 --> 00:26:18,644
Rank.

271
00:26:18,645 --> 00:26:20,211
How's Abilene?

272
00:26:20,212 --> 00:26:23,414
Well, made it out
with my wallet

273
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:26,451
which is better'd I can say
for of my outfit.

274
00:26:26,452 --> 00:26:28,286
You hiring on with us?

275
00:26:28,287 --> 00:26:30,657
Yeah. Got nothing
better to do.

276
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:36,628
What's her deal?
She's pretty sporty.

277
00:26:36,629 --> 00:26:40,999
She was paired up with Ennis
till a Comanchero shot him.

278
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,302
She plugged that son of a bitch
three times in the chest.

279
00:26:44,303 --> 00:26:46,038
Ennis got killed?

280
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:50,376
Yeah, she won't be
in the mood for you.

281
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,313
They're all
in the mood for me.

282
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:11,297
Hi. My name's Colton.
What's yours?

283
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,105
What do I call ya?

284
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:22,508
You don't.

285
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:29,081
Ennis was a friend of mine.

286
00:27:36,823 --> 00:27:38,024
He was a good hand.

287
00:27:40,126 --> 00:27:41,260
I'm sorry he's gone.

288
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:44,697
Me too.

289
00:27:46,232 --> 00:27:52,503
If... if I can do anything...

290
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:53,504
let me know.

291
00:27:57,576 --> 00:27:58,911
There's nothing to do.

292
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,016
Ma'am.

293
00:28:16,662 --> 00:28:19,030
They was more than paired up.

294
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:21,599
She's in mourning
like a damn widow.

295
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,303
She is a widow.

296
00:28:49,495 --> 00:28:50,562
Girl...

297
00:28:52,298 --> 00:28:55,134
You go looking for trouble,
you gonna find it every time.

298
00:29:00,639 --> 00:29:03,009
I wasn't looking for nuthin'
and it still found me.

299
00:29:15,021 --> 00:29:16,889
We should have
a look at the river.

300
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:18,757
Take John to your mom.

301
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:21,692
She ain't back yet.

302
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:36,542
Hold him for me?

303
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:11,043
Don't make any sense.

304
00:30:19,018 --> 00:30:22,487
Give me a minute.

305
00:30:22,488 --> 00:30:25,023
Two, three...

306
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,824
Look at you!
Oh my God.

307
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:29,594
Oh my God.

308
00:30:29,595 --> 00:30:31,463
I've never seen that before.

309
00:30:32,865 --> 00:30:34,934
Never seen it before!

310
00:30:36,368 --> 00:30:38,170
Hey.

311
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:43,075
I gotta go study the river.

312
00:30:46,645 --> 00:30:50,548
Study the river.

313
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:52,450
Can I trust you to stay here?

314
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:56,422
Yep. This long.
As long as this is.

315
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:02,928
Awmo study the river...
Oh no...

316
00:31:02,929 --> 00:31:05,364
I think I'm in trouble
but I don't care.

317
00:31:10,036 --> 00:31:11,036
Whoa!

318
00:31:16,775 --> 00:31:18,177
Damn.

319
00:31:19,645 --> 00:31:21,080
They won't ever make it.

320
00:31:23,482 --> 00:31:25,083
James: We'll run the cattle
across first,

321
00:31:25,084 --> 00:31:27,452
take the wagons over one-by-one.

322
00:31:27,453 --> 00:31:30,555
And I mean us.

323
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:32,123
It'll take all day,

324
00:31:32,124 --> 00:31:36,127
but we'll lose half of them
if we let them emigrants do it.

325
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:37,997
How we getting
them emigrants across?

326
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:43,334
That'll take all day, too.

327
00:31:43,335 --> 00:31:47,172
- At least nobody drowns.
- That's two days we don't have.

328
00:31:47,173 --> 00:31:50,541
We should be in Kansas by now.

329
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:53,544
At some point they gotta learn
to do things for themselves.

330
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:55,313
The only thing they're
gonna learn crossing that

331
00:31:55,314 --> 00:31:57,083
is how to die.

332
00:32:05,557 --> 00:32:07,092
Don't think this
is the place to try

333
00:32:07,093 --> 00:32:08,493
and teach 'em
something, Captain.

334
00:32:08,494 --> 00:32:12,398
It's this to the Rockies,
and then it's worse.

335
00:32:13,532 --> 00:32:15,133
If they can't cross
a fucking river,

336
00:32:15,134 --> 00:32:16,834
how are they gonna cross
the mountains

337
00:32:16,835 --> 00:32:19,504
or the goddam desert
we go through first?

338
00:32:19,505 --> 00:32:21,172
Don't get mad.

339
00:32:21,173 --> 00:32:24,942
We ain't gotta do
what the farmer say.

340
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:28,279
If you wanna swim 'em
across the river,

341
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,082
then we'll swim 'em
across the river.

342
00:32:33,052 --> 00:32:35,587
I'm mad 'cause he's right.

343
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:23,634
Wherever we're going
it better be paradise...

344
00:33:23,635 --> 00:33:26,638
'Cause it's costing
us a daughter...

345
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:32,243
If you ask me,
it's a shitty trade.

346
00:33:32,244 --> 00:33:33,644
We ain't trading nuthin'.

347
00:33:33,645 --> 00:33:34,713
She killed a man.

348
00:33:37,216 --> 00:33:38,684
And she was about
to kill another.

349
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:42,920
I look in her eyes

350
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:46,991
and the person staring back
at me, I don't recognize.

351
00:33:46,992 --> 00:33:49,260
I will never forgive
you for this!

352
00:33:49,261 --> 00:33:50,862
You don't forgive me?

353
00:33:52,331 --> 00:33:53,499
I don't forgive me.

354
00:34:48,554 --> 00:34:50,856
You didn't see the way
he was looking at me.

355
00:34:56,762 --> 00:34:58,230
Wouldn't matter if you did.

356
00:35:01,267 --> 00:35:03,402
Men don't know how
to read that look.

357
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:05,671
Only know how to give it.

358
00:35:11,177 --> 00:35:14,946
I'm gonna tell you a story
and you're gonna listen.

359
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:19,285
I think I've earned that right.

360
00:35:21,287 --> 00:35:22,287
Hope I have.

361
00:35:22,288 --> 00:35:24,356
I'll listen.

362
00:35:29,395 --> 00:35:30,862
First man I killed... hm...

363
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,067
He was just a boy.

364
00:35:38,304 --> 00:35:39,505
Younger than you.

365
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:46,143
The reason companies
have flag bearers

366
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,947
is so soldiers know
to stay with their group.

367
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,649
And generals on the hill

368
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:54,552
can track the progress
of the battle.

369
00:35:54,553 --> 00:35:58,457
So much dust and smoke
in battle.

370
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:01,427
You're fighting in a fog.

371
00:36:02,561 --> 00:36:04,229
It's hard to make out the enemy.

372
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:07,665
Can't tell your men from theirs.

373
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:10,035
But you can always look up
and see the flags.

374
00:36:17,443 --> 00:36:19,311
So, we shoot flag bearers first.

375
00:36:22,348 --> 00:36:23,749
And I did.

376
00:36:26,084 --> 00:36:28,720
That boy's face
was burned into my brain.

377
00:36:30,322 --> 00:36:31,889
The whole world seemed to stop

378
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:35,994
as this boy,
he's looking right at me.

379
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:40,499
By the end of the battle, I...

380
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:44,503
I'd killed so many men.

381
00:36:46,104 --> 00:36:47,904
I couldn't remember
what that boy looked like.

382
00:36:52,844 --> 00:36:54,145
Still can't.

383
00:36:57,949 --> 00:37:01,019
That man you shot
was already dead.

384
00:37:03,855 --> 00:37:07,658
Whether we hanged him
or he bled out,

385
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:09,761
his time on this earth was done.

386
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,134
You did not kill him.

387
00:37:18,304 --> 00:37:19,471
Understand?

388
00:37:22,808 --> 00:37:25,310
The meanest thing
you can do to yourself

389
00:37:25,311 --> 00:37:26,912
is hate somebody else.

390
00:37:28,347 --> 00:37:31,782
I know what it feels like
to hate the world.

391
00:37:31,783 --> 00:37:33,452
You don't want
to feel it, honey.

392
00:37:34,453 --> 00:37:36,388
Be sad. Miss him.

393
00:37:37,389 --> 00:37:38,890
Cry yourself blind.

394
00:37:40,892 --> 00:37:42,160
But you leave the hating to me.

395
00:38:26,905 --> 00:38:28,674
I got 35 dollars.

396
00:38:31,209 --> 00:38:34,580
Wish it was more,
but it was fair.

397
00:38:36,782 --> 00:38:38,550
There's stew in the pot
if you're hungry.

398
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:41,420
I am.

399
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:56,667
Where'd you find meat?

400
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:59,370
It's rabbit.

401
00:38:59,371 --> 00:39:00,706
I figured out the shotgun.

402
00:39:06,712 --> 00:39:08,813
Don't taste like rabbit.

403
00:39:08,814 --> 00:39:11,550
- Mostly rabbit.
- What else is it?

404
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,719
Rattlesnake.

405
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:16,622
Figured than one out, too.

406
00:39:17,823 --> 00:39:19,190
Got you something.

407
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,791
Why would you buy me this?

408
00:39:53,792 --> 00:39:55,026
Well...

409
00:39:57,729 --> 00:39:59,465
If I looked like you, I...

410
00:40:01,467 --> 00:40:04,935
figure I'd stare at myself...

411
00:40:04,936 --> 00:40:07,005
every chance I got.

412
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,778
This is a present.

413
00:40:13,779 --> 00:40:15,780
Yes, it is.

414
00:40:15,781 --> 00:40:19,450
You won't marry me.

415
00:40:19,451 --> 00:40:22,152
You won't love me,

416
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:23,722
but you will buy me gifts.

417
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:28,860
You're sad... and scared.

418
00:40:32,731 --> 00:40:34,533
You have every right to be.

419
00:40:36,835 --> 00:40:39,970
If I can give you something
that makes you happy

420
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:42,173
and protect you...

421
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:45,577
Don't see the crime in it.

422
00:40:47,412 --> 00:40:48,714
You want me happy.

423
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:51,617
Course I do.

424
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:54,352
You want me to feel safe.

425
00:40:56,722 --> 00:40:57,723
Yes, ma'am.

426
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:21,412
That's love.

427
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:28,620
Me letting you take care
of me is not fear.

428
00:41:30,355 --> 00:41:31,890
It's loving you back.

429
00:41:57,482 --> 00:41:58,684
Do I look scared to you?

430
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,134
I'm not the scared one.

431
00:42:20,105 --> 00:42:21,105
You are.

432
00:43:03,548 --> 00:43:05,383
I laid in the grass...

433
00:43:09,788 --> 00:43:11,122
closed my eyes...

434
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:15,326
and I saw him.

435
00:43:19,197 --> 00:43:20,799
Laughed at his goofy hair.

436
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:26,271
Felt the electricity
of his touch.

437
00:43:31,476 --> 00:43:35,280
I laid in the grass
and I loved him.

438
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:46,992
Then I opened my eyes...

439
00:43:50,862 --> 00:43:52,698
and I could see color again.

440
00:44:00,772 --> 00:44:02,741
Ch-ch-ch-ch...

441
00:44:05,276 --> 00:44:06,678
Hup hup!

442
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,949
Hup, hup... Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch...

443
00:44:20,458 --> 00:44:22,492
Elsa.

444
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:24,361
What's that?

445
00:44:24,362 --> 00:44:26,931
That's my name.

446
00:44:26,932 --> 00:44:30,868
It'll come in handy
to know it.

447
00:44:30,869 --> 00:44:32,803
Don't bother flirting with me.

448
00:44:32,804 --> 00:44:34,638
Why not?

449
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:38,576
You're too pretty for me.
I prefer to be the pretty one.

450
00:44:41,279 --> 00:44:43,782
Ch-ch-ch-ch...

451
00:44:46,317 --> 00:44:48,252
Bet you prefer it too.

452
00:44:48,253 --> 00:44:50,388
Ch-ch...

453
00:44:55,827 --> 00:44:58,796
James: You drive my horse
across the river,

454
00:44:58,797 --> 00:44:59,830
I'll drive the wagon.

455
00:44:59,831 --> 00:45:02,032
I am perfectly capable.

456
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:04,468
I ain't questioning
what you're able to do.

457
00:45:04,469 --> 00:45:06,904
There's three times
as many things that can go wrong

458
00:45:06,905 --> 00:45:09,406
in the water with that.

459
00:45:09,407 --> 00:45:13,077
Now, you can not forgive me
all you want.

460
00:45:13,078 --> 00:45:15,312
Add this to
your list of reasons.

461
00:45:15,313 --> 00:45:16,748
But I ain't losing
you to a river.

462
00:45:19,417 --> 00:45:20,718
You're forgiven.

463
00:46:25,083 --> 00:46:26,217
Good morning.

464
00:46:28,186 --> 00:46:29,720
Mornin', ma'am.

465
00:47:00,251 --> 00:47:01,920
No more "ma'am."

466
00:47:05,991 --> 00:47:07,425
Noemi.

467
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,361
Good morning, Noemi.

468
00:47:13,865 --> 00:47:18,003
Mornin'... Noemi.

469
00:48:12,924 --> 00:48:15,359
The spring's back
in your step, I see.

470
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,895
You're the only person
who talked to me about him.

471
00:48:21,466 --> 00:48:22,900
Thank you.

472
00:48:30,775 --> 00:48:34,611
Shhh.

473
00:48:34,612 --> 00:48:36,380
He don't like the water, huh?

474
00:48:36,381 --> 00:48:40,050
He's excited.
The water's his favorite part.

475
00:48:40,051 --> 00:48:41,886
- Better let him at it then.
- Okay.

476
00:48:42,954 --> 00:48:44,589
Come on.

477
00:48:54,565 --> 00:48:56,300
Come on, cow.
Hup, hup, hup.

478
00:48:56,301 --> 00:48:58,136
Get up, get up, ch-ch-ch...

479
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:03,408
Hup, hup, hup.
Watch out, watch out.

480
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:10,948
Come on, cow. Hup, hup.

481
00:49:14,885 --> 00:49:16,254
Let's bring 'em, boys.

482
00:49:24,829 --> 00:49:26,830
We were leaving Texas.

483
00:49:26,831 --> 00:49:28,898
Entering the Indian territory...

484
00:49:28,899 --> 00:49:31,769
and redefining
our meaning of unknown.

485
00:49:33,604 --> 00:49:36,506
Far from the cities that
have paved the world away,

486
00:49:36,507 --> 00:49:39,477
and the farms which
have tamed it into a resource.

487
00:49:42,847 --> 00:49:45,683
We were no longer under
the cloud of civilization.

488
00:49:47,085 --> 00:49:49,087
Only sky above us now.

489
00:49:50,155 --> 00:49:53,190
No more walking over bridges.

490
00:49:53,191 --> 00:49:55,626
Out here, we swim
horseback through rivers.

491
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:05,569
There is nowhere to chain
love to vows and ceremony.

492
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:09,506
Out here love burns
through you like a fever.

493
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:12,376
And when the devil comes
to rip that love from you,

494
00:50:12,377 --> 00:50:15,145
there is no funeral
with somber speeches

495
00:50:15,146 --> 00:50:18,483
that dull our senses
and deaden our hearts.

496
00:50:19,884 --> 00:50:21,918
Out here, you turn
toward the pain

497
00:50:21,919 --> 00:50:24,655
as it tears into you,
and you let it.

498
00:50:26,124 --> 00:50:28,859
When you do,
the devil gets bored.

499
00:50:30,195 --> 00:50:32,063
He seeks another soul to eat.

500
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:35,966
And you get to live again.
