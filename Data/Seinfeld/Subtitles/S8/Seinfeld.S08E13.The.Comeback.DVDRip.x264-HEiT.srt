1
00:00:06,357 --> 00:00:09,030
-Well, that was all right, huh?
-Yeah.

2
00:00:09,197 --> 00:00:10,630
Well...

3
00:00:10,797 --> 00:00:12,674
-...good night.
-Yeah, good night.

4
00:00:49,157 --> 00:00:51,148
Jerry, we can only stay four days.

5
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:54,115
Well, l'm upset,
but we'll make the most of it.

6
00:00:54,277 --> 00:00:56,074
Helen, did you pack my travel gym?

7
00:00:56,237 --> 00:00:59,388
Yes. Oh, your father bought
an exercise device off television.

8
00:00:59,557 --> 00:01:00,910
He does it every morning at 4.

9
00:01:01,077 --> 00:01:04,592
Only 25 minutes a day, and you can
attach it to any doorknob.

10
00:01:05,077 --> 00:01:08,069
So l guess your travel miles
are about to expire?

11
00:01:08,237 --> 00:01:11,786
Well, actually, Jerry, we wanted
to talk to you about something.

12
00:01:11,957 --> 00:01:14,425
Am l finally getting a baby brother?

13
00:01:14,837 --> 00:01:16,111
Jerry, be serious.

14
00:01:16,277 --> 00:01:18,347
How would you feel
if we sold the Cadillac?

15
00:01:18,517 --> 00:01:20,587
What? The Cadillac l bought for you?

16
00:01:20,757 --> 00:01:22,076
lt's too much car, Jerry.

17
00:01:22,237 --> 00:01:25,468
Oh, come on. You love that car.
What about the Northstar system?

18
00:01:25,637 --> 00:01:27,628
l don't think we even use it.

19
00:01:27,957 --> 00:01:30,266
Well, it's a gift,
and l want you to keep it.

20
00:01:30,437 --> 00:01:31,790
We already sold it.

21
00:01:32,277 --> 00:01:34,347
Why didn't you tell me
before you sold it?

22
00:01:34,517 --> 00:01:37,077
We had a buyer, and we couldn't
get a free flight until now.

23
00:01:37,237 --> 00:01:38,829
We could but we wanted
the bulkhead.

24
00:01:38,997 --> 00:01:40,555
Oh, my God.

25
00:01:42,397 --> 00:01:44,069
Man, that Emily is wearing me out.

26
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:46,751
-Kramer....
-No, no, no, it's not the sex, Jerry.

27
00:01:46,917 --> 00:01:48,111
Hey, Seinfelds.

28
00:01:48,277 --> 00:01:49,869
-Hi, Kramer.
-Hi, Kramer.

29
00:01:50,037 --> 00:01:52,426
-We're in the middle of a discussion.
-Yeah? What about?

30
00:01:52,597 --> 00:01:54,508
Jerry's upset. We sold the Cadillac.

31
00:01:54,677 --> 00:01:57,316
-What did you get for it?
-Jack Klompus gave us 6 grand.

32
00:01:57,477 --> 00:01:59,752
You sold my Cadillac
to Jack Klompus?

33
00:01:59,957 --> 00:02:02,232
-We want you to have the money.
-l don't need money.

34
00:02:02,397 --> 00:02:05,116
-What are you talking about?
-You'd a check bounce at the bodega.

35
00:02:05,277 --> 00:02:08,428
ls that what this is all about? l bounce
a check and you sold a Cadillac?

36
00:02:08,597 --> 00:02:11,953
Well, also, Jerry, we read
an article in the Sun-Sentinel.

37
00:02:12,117 --> 00:02:14,711
lt says that stand-up comedy
is not what it used to be...

38
00:02:14,877 --> 00:02:16,595
...what with Def Jam and all.

39
00:02:17,317 --> 00:02:19,308
Yeah, that Def Jam is a force.

40
00:02:19,757 --> 00:02:21,554
Jerry, you know,
l hear wonderful things...

41
00:02:21,717 --> 00:02:23,912
...about Bloomingdale's
executive training program.

42
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:25,556
Oh, my God.

43
00:02:25,717 --> 00:02:27,947
You've given this comedy thing
your best shot.

44
00:02:28,117 --> 00:02:30,870
Yeah, you had some
good observations, but it's over.

45
00:02:31,037 --> 00:02:32,789
Now, this Bloomingdale thing:

46
00:02:32,957 --> 00:02:34,629
That could be the next wave.

47
00:02:39,477 --> 00:02:43,265
Excuse me. A pound
of Arabian Mocha Java, please.

48
00:02:43,637 --> 00:02:46,435
So you understand how my Peterman
stock options are gonna work?

49
00:02:46,597 --> 00:02:48,269
l'm going to the bathroom.

50
00:02:48,437 --> 00:02:50,792
lt's just very interesting.

51
00:02:50,957 --> 00:02:53,471
Yeah, when it's your money
it's fascinating.

52
00:02:53,637 --> 00:02:55,468
Arabian Mocha Java.

53
00:02:55,757 --> 00:02:57,190
Oh, l got it.

54
00:02:57,557 --> 00:02:59,070
That Arabian is strong coffee.

55
00:02:59,557 --> 00:03:01,309
lt's PLO blend.

56
00:03:03,797 --> 00:03:05,071
Oh, l got your coffee.

57
00:03:05,637 --> 00:03:08,595
-Oh, here, let me--
-No, it's on me.

58
00:03:08,757 --> 00:03:11,715
Oh, man. Okay, listen, guys,
l'm gonna be late. l'll see you, okay?

59
00:03:11,877 --> 00:03:13,754
-Yeah.
-Bye.

60
00:03:16,757 --> 00:03:18,475
-You see what just happened here?
-What?

61
00:03:19,117 --> 00:03:21,631
She treated me
to the Arabian Mocha Java.

62
00:03:21,837 --> 00:03:23,953
And you misinterpret this how?

63
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:26,473
She's sticking it that
she makes more money.

64
00:03:26,637 --> 00:03:29,709
l'm sure she was just being nice
buying you the coffee.

65
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,071
Not nice. Sticking it to me.

66
00:03:31,237 --> 00:03:32,716
-You're crazy.
-Sticking it to me.

67
00:03:32,877 --> 00:03:34,788
-George.
-Sticking it!

68
00:03:37,157 --> 00:03:39,148
So you're buying the car
back for your parents?

69
00:03:39,317 --> 00:03:42,673
-l'm flying down to Florida tomorrow.
-Your parents will never let you do it.

70
00:03:42,837 --> 00:03:46,193
They lie to me about selling the car,
l'll lie to them about buying it back.

71
00:03:46,357 --> 00:03:49,508
They think they can dump
6 grand on me? Think again.

72
00:03:50,677 --> 00:03:52,907
What kind of money
you think your parents have?

73
00:03:53,077 --> 00:03:55,466
-Excuse me?
-Bet they have more money than mine.

74
00:03:56,037 --> 00:03:58,187
-Come on. Your parents have money.
-You think?

75
00:03:58,357 --> 00:04:00,552
-When do they ever spend money?
-Never.

76
00:04:00,717 --> 00:04:02,275
-What are their expenses?
-Nothing.

77
00:04:02,437 --> 00:04:04,268
-Where do they go on vacation?
-Nowhere.

78
00:04:05,717 --> 00:04:08,356
-How much do you think they have?
-Few hundred grand?

79
00:04:08,517 --> 00:04:12,430
You're saying l stand to inherit
$300,000? ls that what you're saying?

80
00:04:12,597 --> 00:04:15,475
-You may not see it for 20 years.
-Twenty years? That long?

81
00:04:15,637 --> 00:04:17,389
Your father eat
bacon and eggs every day?

82
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:19,229
Unfortunately, yes.

83
00:04:19,677 --> 00:04:20,905
How's your family history?

84
00:04:21,237 --> 00:04:23,467
-l have an aunt that died at 7.
-Really?

85
00:04:23,957 --> 00:04:25,595
Aunt Baby.

86
00:04:27,397 --> 00:04:30,355
-Elaine, you got a moment?
-Yeah, Kramer, come on in.

87
00:04:30,717 --> 00:04:33,834
l need to speak to you
about some lady problems.

88
00:04:33,997 --> 00:04:35,794
Okay.

89
00:04:36,117 --> 00:04:40,076
You know, after l have sex with Emily,
l don't want her in the bed anymore.

90
00:04:41,717 --> 00:04:43,867
Yeah, because she's
throwing off my whole sleep.

91
00:04:44,037 --> 00:04:46,790
-She's got the jimmy legs.
-Jimmy legs?

92
00:04:47,557 --> 00:04:49,309
Jimmy leg.

93
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:53,554
So.... Well, maybe l should
just be honest with her, huh?

94
00:04:53,717 --> 00:04:55,947
Tell her after sex
you just want her out of there?

95
00:04:56,157 --> 00:04:58,625
Well, l'd say it nicely.

96
00:04:59,437 --> 00:05:02,986
-l don't think so.
-Well, you know, l really like this girl.

97
00:05:03,157 --> 00:05:04,875
l think if l could work out
this thing--

98
00:05:05,037 --> 00:05:07,505
Yeah, l gotta be honest
with you, Kramer.

99
00:05:07,677 --> 00:05:10,953
You might be more than
just a couple of tweaks away...

100
00:05:11,117 --> 00:05:13,347
...from a healthy relationship.

101
00:05:14,037 --> 00:05:17,393
Well, you're not exactly
zeroing in yourself, lady.

102
00:05:18,197 --> 00:05:20,995
All right, get out. Get out!

103
00:05:22,957 --> 00:05:26,188
So listen, l've gotta go down to
Atlantic City. l'm performing at Bally's.

104
00:05:26,357 --> 00:05:27,756
You just heard about this today?

105
00:05:27,917 --> 00:05:30,511
They had a cancellation,
and they instantly called me.

106
00:05:30,677 --> 00:05:32,907
-Who cancelled?
-Carrot Top.

107
00:05:34,157 --> 00:05:36,352
l told you: My career is fine.

108
00:05:39,037 --> 00:05:40,595
l've been thinking about the family.

109
00:05:41,597 --> 00:05:43,394
Tell me about Aunt Baby.

110
00:05:44,117 --> 00:05:45,516
She's deceased.

111
00:05:47,157 --> 00:05:48,510
Yeah.

112
00:05:48,677 --> 00:05:50,030
Why did she die so young?

113
00:05:50,397 --> 00:05:52,513
She had problems.

114
00:05:52,677 --> 00:05:55,714
-lnternal.
-ls that common in our family?

115
00:05:55,877 --> 00:05:58,994
Well, your Uncle Moe,
he died a young man.

116
00:05:59,157 --> 00:06:01,068
Also internal problems.

117
00:06:01,237 --> 00:06:03,034
lt's that temper on your side.

118
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:07,475
They're yelling and yelling and then
one day, they're all gone.

119
00:06:07,637 --> 00:06:09,832
What about your side?
Your cousin Henny.

120
00:06:09,997 --> 00:06:12,192
She was sickly
from the moment l met her.

121
00:06:12,357 --> 00:06:14,188
Don't you talk about Henny!

122
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,549
So l guess you two
are the lucky ones.

123
00:06:16,797 --> 00:06:18,435
So far.

124
00:06:18,597 --> 00:06:23,990
Frank, if Aunt Baby were alive today,
how old would she be?

125
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,036
She'd never make it.

126
00:06:30,317 --> 00:06:32,706
So let me get this straight.
You enjoy the lovemaking--

127
00:06:33,717 --> 00:06:37,346
-Well, do you?
-Oh, yeah. Like strawberry pie.

128
00:06:38,117 --> 00:06:40,756
Okay. But you have a problem
sharing a bed with me.

129
00:06:40,917 --> 00:06:42,794
l know it's not what the ladies like...

130
00:06:42,957 --> 00:06:45,835
...but without some solid sack time,
l'm a zombie.

131
00:06:45,997 --> 00:06:48,750
-l don't know.
-Oh, come on, man.

132
00:06:48,917 --> 00:06:50,669
Meet me halfway.

133
00:06:50,997 --> 00:06:53,750
-You're not easy, Kramer.
-l know.

134
00:06:58,637 --> 00:07:03,427
So to what do l owe the pleasure
of this unannounced visit?

135
00:07:03,597 --> 00:07:05,189
l wanna buy back the Cadillac.

136
00:07:05,357 --> 00:07:07,313
You wanna buy it back? Why?

137
00:07:07,477 --> 00:07:10,116
You got drugs hidden in the trunk?

138
00:07:11,277 --> 00:07:14,508
-l'm kidding.
-All right. l'll give you 9000 for it.

139
00:07:14,677 --> 00:07:17,350
Nine thousand for a Cadillac?
lt's got no miles on it.

140
00:07:17,517 --> 00:07:20,077
-You bought it for six.
-You're not me.

141
00:07:21,597 --> 00:07:26,512
-How much do you want for it?
-The Kelley Blue Book value: $22,000.

142
00:07:26,677 --> 00:07:27,951
Fourteen thousand.

143
00:07:28,117 --> 00:07:31,587
Done. But l get
to drive it tomorrow...

144
00:07:31,757 --> 00:07:33,634
...because Doris
wants to go to Naples.

145
00:07:35,317 --> 00:07:37,273
You need a pen?

146
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:39,236
Still works.

147
00:07:42,157 --> 00:07:44,512
-Hey, where's Jerry?
-He's performing at Bally's...

148
00:07:44,677 --> 00:07:47,555
-...in Atlantic City.
-Oh, okay.

149
00:07:47,997 --> 00:07:51,467
Yeah, l need his shoeshine kit.

150
00:07:51,677 --> 00:07:53,872
He always hides it from me.

151
00:07:54,837 --> 00:07:57,635
Yeah, Bally's?
Yeah, Jerry Seinfeld's room, please.

152
00:07:57,797 --> 00:07:59,071
You know that number?

153
00:07:59,237 --> 00:08:01,148
l used to have a problem.

154
00:08:02,397 --> 00:08:03,910
What do you mean,
he's not registered?

155
00:08:04,997 --> 00:08:08,069
-Well, S-E-l-N-V--
-F. F-E-L-D.

156
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:10,228
F-E-L-D.

157
00:08:11,797 --> 00:08:13,947
Well, l think you're wrong.

158
00:08:15,597 --> 00:08:17,952
All right, you have a lucky day too.

159
00:08:18,117 --> 00:08:20,267
-He's not there?
-No, they never heard of him.

160
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:27,156
This is so nice of you to take us
all out to dinner, George.

161
00:08:27,317 --> 00:08:30,992
Well, as much as l enjoy
all the good-natured ribbing...

162
00:08:31,157 --> 00:08:32,749
...nothing really makes me happier...

163
00:08:32,917 --> 00:08:35,272
...than spending money
on the people l care about.

164
00:08:35,997 --> 00:08:37,874
-Where's Jerry?
-Oh, he'll be here.

165
00:08:38,037 --> 00:08:40,505
By the way, Elaine, thank you...

166
00:08:40,677 --> 00:08:43,635
...for laying out
for the Arabian Mocha Java.

167
00:08:43,797 --> 00:08:46,709
George, you didn't have to do this.

168
00:08:46,877 --> 00:08:50,790
l'm president of a big company.
l can afford to buy you coffee.

169
00:08:50,957 --> 00:08:52,549
-President?
-Yeah.

170
00:08:52,717 --> 00:08:54,355
-Hey, look, he's back. Hey.
-Hey.

171
00:08:54,517 --> 00:08:56,985
l got your message so l came
straight from Atlantic City.

172
00:08:57,157 --> 00:08:59,546
Jerry, Kramer called Bally's.
You weren't registered.

173
00:08:59,837 --> 00:09:02,351
Well, l can't stay
under my own name.

174
00:09:02,517 --> 00:09:05,315
l was registered
under ''Slappy White.''

175
00:09:08,277 --> 00:09:09,790
Mom. Dad.

176
00:09:09,957 --> 00:09:13,506
Well, look who's here.
Hello, Seinfelds.

177
00:09:15,277 --> 00:09:18,952
-What are you doing here?
-We're having an upscale dinner.

178
00:09:19,117 --> 00:09:20,914
-What?
-Well, after talking to you...

179
00:09:21,077 --> 00:09:23,796
...we realized we may not
have much time left.

180
00:09:23,957 --> 00:09:25,709
So we're blowing it all.

181
00:09:26,077 --> 00:09:29,752
Look, George, it's a Pierre Cardin.

182
00:09:35,197 --> 00:09:39,156
-That was all right.
-Yeah.

183
00:09:41,277 --> 00:09:43,154
Well, l'll see you.

184
00:10:19,837 --> 00:10:21,714
-Hello.
-Jerry.

185
00:10:21,877 --> 00:10:25,392
l had a little mishap with the car.

186
00:10:28,597 --> 00:10:30,906
l'm down here in Alligator Alley.

187
00:10:31,357 --> 00:10:34,190
-You better get down here.
-All right.

188
00:10:34,517 --> 00:10:36,109
Who was that?

189
00:10:36,277 --> 00:10:38,347
That was the Golden Nugget...

190
00:10:38,517 --> 00:10:40,235
...also in Atlantic City.

191
00:10:40,397 --> 00:10:42,706
They heard such good things
about my show at Bally's...

192
00:10:42,877 --> 00:10:44,435
...they want me for tonight.

193
00:10:45,957 --> 00:10:50,348
So l'll have to repack and go.

194
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:54,507
That didn't sound
like the Golden Nugget.

195
00:10:54,677 --> 00:10:58,352
l'm worried. What happens
if we have to support Jerry?

196
00:10:58,837 --> 00:11:01,670
-l'll have to go back to work.
-Where would you work?

197
00:11:02,117 --> 00:11:04,073
Maybe l should talk to Elaine.

198
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:15,306
Well, Mr. Seinfeld, l'm not sure
l understand why you want a job here.

199
00:11:15,477 --> 00:11:16,671
What's not to understand?

200
00:11:16,837 --> 00:11:18,873
Well, for one thing,
you live in Florida.

201
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,707
l'm very comfortable
working out of the house.

202
00:11:21,877 --> 00:11:24,516
l have a phone.
We have a Kinko's nearby.

203
00:11:25,037 --> 00:11:28,552
You know, l think
that my résumé speaks for itself.

204
00:11:28,717 --> 00:11:31,629
-Where is your résumé?
-l don't have it. l'll mail you one.

205
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:33,875
All right, Mr. Seinfeld...

206
00:11:34,037 --> 00:11:36,392
...what kind of a position
did you have in mind?

207
00:11:36,557 --> 00:11:38,149
-You sell clothes, don't you?
-Yeah.

208
00:11:38,317 --> 00:11:42,196
Well, l sold raincoats
in the garment centre for 38 years.

209
00:11:42,357 --> 00:11:44,746
-ln 1 949--
-All right. All right. All right.

210
00:11:44,917 --> 00:11:48,068
You come in tomorrow.
We'll find something for you to do.

211
00:11:48,237 --> 00:11:49,989
You won't regret this, Ms. Benes.

212
00:11:50,157 --> 00:11:53,706
What time should l be in? l get up at 4.
l could be here as early as 4:25.

213
00:11:54,997 --> 00:11:56,635
Oh, Elaine...

214
00:11:56,797 --> 00:12:00,949
...this dry air is curing me
like a Black Forest ham.

215
00:12:01,477 --> 00:12:05,072
Mr. Peterman? You're back.

216
00:12:07,237 --> 00:12:08,875
Who's Mr. Fancy?

217
00:12:13,677 --> 00:12:15,952
l was thinking maybe
l should spend the night.

218
00:12:16,117 --> 00:12:19,189
Oh, that's sweet, but actually, l....

219
00:12:19,517 --> 00:12:21,667
l think l'd prefer it if you left.

220
00:12:21,917 --> 00:12:24,351
-What?
-You were completely right.

221
00:12:24,517 --> 00:12:26,633
l sleep so much better
when l'm alone.

222
00:12:27,877 --> 00:12:31,108
-And you scream in your sleep.
-l do?

223
00:12:34,277 --> 00:12:37,633
There was a man. He was trying
to get into my apartment last night.

224
00:12:37,877 --> 00:12:40,186
He was jiggling the doorknob
for 25 minutes.

225
00:12:41,397 --> 00:12:43,752
-Come on. lt was probably the wind.
-No, no.

226
00:12:43,917 --> 00:12:45,714
No, it was a fearless cat burglar.

227
00:12:45,877 --> 00:12:47,833
Now, listen, you gotta
let me sleep here.

228
00:12:47,997 --> 00:12:52,070
l'll stay over here on my side,
and l'll stuff a sock in my mouth.

229
00:12:52,237 --> 00:12:53,795
Because l don't wanna sleep alone.

230
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,348
Well, l do.

231
00:13:02,877 --> 00:13:04,629
What took you so long?

232
00:13:04,797 --> 00:13:06,992
l live in New York.

233
00:13:07,717 --> 00:13:09,070
What the hell happened?

234
00:13:09,237 --> 00:13:11,626
This thing is a behemoth.

235
00:13:11,797 --> 00:13:13,196
What did you do?

236
00:13:13,357 --> 00:13:16,349
l was making a simple lane change.

237
00:13:16,517 --> 00:13:19,475
l put on the blinker,
and it took off on me.

238
00:13:19,637 --> 00:13:21,673
And the next thing you know,
l was submerged.

239
00:13:21,837 --> 00:13:25,876
l'm telling you, Jerry, l'm very lucky
that those crocs didn't get me.

240
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:35,473
You are such an idiot.

241
00:13:36,717 --> 00:13:39,106
Well, we got to get the car
cleaned up for my parents.

242
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:41,347
Do whatever you want. lt's your car.

243
00:13:41,517 --> 00:13:43,633
My car? You drove it
into the swamp.

244
00:13:43,797 --> 00:13:46,675
lt drove itself into the swamp.

245
00:13:46,837 --> 00:13:50,625
Besides, l think l lost my pen too.

246
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:53,470
You know, that almost
makes this all worthwhile.

247
00:13:56,477 --> 00:13:58,832
Why is there a Cadillac parked
in front of the house?

248
00:13:59,717 --> 00:14:01,833
That's your mother's new car.

249
00:14:03,077 --> 00:14:04,271
You bought that?

250
00:14:04,437 --> 00:14:06,189
lt's a coupe de elegance.

251
00:14:07,117 --> 00:14:09,108
Your father wanted a Mercedes...

252
00:14:09,277 --> 00:14:12,030
...but l won't ride in a German car.

253
00:14:13,717 --> 00:14:15,150
Morning.

254
00:14:17,997 --> 00:14:19,669
Oh, boy.

255
00:14:19,837 --> 00:14:23,147
-What the hell is going on here?
-l had some trouble at my place.

256
00:14:23,317 --> 00:14:25,831
So l need a little company
at night to sleep.

257
00:14:26,837 --> 00:14:31,388
George, your mother and l
and Kramer have been talking.

258
00:14:31,557 --> 00:14:33,593
-Oh, God.
-George...

259
00:14:33,757 --> 00:14:36,317
...your parents can't blow
their savings in this community.

260
00:14:36,477 --> 00:14:39,913
lt's low-rent. We feel that Florida is
really the place where they should be.

261
00:14:40,077 --> 00:14:43,069
You can drop a grand
in Disney World like that.

262
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:45,987
Wait a minute. You're moving
to Florida again?

263
00:14:46,157 --> 00:14:49,672
Well, it's either that
or we stay here near you...

264
00:14:49,837 --> 00:14:51,987
...and just sit on the money.

265
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:54,671
What do you think
we should do, Georgie?

266
00:14:59,277 --> 00:15:02,792
So effective immediately, Ms. Benes
will return to her old position...

267
00:15:02,957 --> 00:15:07,155
...at her original salary and l,
of course, will return to mine.

268
00:15:07,317 --> 00:15:10,514
Kudos, Elaine, on a job done.

269
00:15:11,517 --> 00:15:13,348
What about my stock options?

270
00:15:13,517 --> 00:15:15,314
l think not.

271
00:15:16,397 --> 00:15:19,116
Now down to business.
l have had this vision...

272
00:15:19,277 --> 00:15:21,666
...of a diaphanous rumrunner scarf.

273
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:24,590
Well, we could fly some fabric in
from our silk factories...

274
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,749
-...for about $1 000 dollars a bolt.
-A thousand?

275
00:15:27,917 --> 00:15:30,033
l know a couple of Chinamen
over on 43rd Street...

276
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:33,348
-...that will do it for half that.
-lt's Asian Americans.

277
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:34,996
What?

278
00:15:35,157 --> 00:15:37,671
Who are you?

279
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:39,270
-Don't worry--
-Morty Seinfeld.

280
00:15:39,437 --> 00:15:42,429
l cut velvet for 40 years
with Harry Alper.

281
00:15:42,597 --> 00:15:44,155
Okay, Mr. Seinfeld, this is not--

282
00:15:44,317 --> 00:15:46,467
Elaine, did you hire this man?

283
00:15:46,637 --> 00:15:51,757
No, no-- Well, l mean, he's more
like an intern, you know, at best.

284
00:15:53,717 --> 00:15:56,106
So if your parents move to Florida,
you're poor.

285
00:15:56,277 --> 00:15:58,552
-But happy.
-Obviously.

286
00:15:58,717 --> 00:16:02,107
And if they stay, you're rich, but....

287
00:16:02,437 --> 00:16:04,155
Obviously.

288
00:16:04,557 --> 00:16:08,516
lt's quite a dilemma. You know,
l have a bit of a dilemma of my own.

289
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:09,871
No, no, no.

290
00:16:10,037 --> 00:16:12,551
We're staying on me.
We haven't solved anything yet.

291
00:16:12,717 --> 00:16:15,436
All right. This is easy.
Just let them go. So now, listen--

292
00:16:15,597 --> 00:16:17,713
What do you mean?
They're spending all my money.

293
00:16:17,877 --> 00:16:19,993
All right. Then they stay.
Let me ask you a ques--

294
00:16:20,157 --> 00:16:22,113
Could you put
a little thought into this?

295
00:16:22,277 --> 00:16:25,189
Jerry's gone. You could humour me.
He humours me.

296
00:16:25,357 --> 00:16:26,676
Speaking of Jerry...

297
00:16:26,837 --> 00:16:30,796
...his father is driving me
so crazy down at Peterman's.

298
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:33,517
Know what l do when one of these
is breathing down my neck?

299
00:16:33,677 --> 00:16:35,474
-What?
-You schedule a late meeting.

300
00:16:35,957 --> 00:16:37,993
-What does that do?
-Old guys are up at 4 a.m.

301
00:16:38,157 --> 00:16:40,591
By 2:30, they're wiped--
How did we get back on to you?

302
00:16:40,757 --> 00:16:42,509
l gotta go.

303
00:16:43,557 --> 00:16:45,752
You know l got nothing out of this.

304
00:16:49,037 --> 00:16:50,356
-Hey, Frank.
-Yeah.

305
00:16:50,517 --> 00:16:54,351
-You got two beds in here.
-That's right. That's me on the left.

306
00:16:54,517 --> 00:16:56,109
So you sleep in separate beds.

307
00:16:56,277 --> 00:16:58,029
Thirty years ago
we came to an agreement.

308
00:16:58,197 --> 00:16:59,630
The only way
l could get some rest.

309
00:16:59,797 --> 00:17:01,230
Really?

310
00:17:01,397 --> 00:17:03,388
Estelle has got the jimmy arms.

311
00:17:03,797 --> 00:17:05,355
You can get that in your arms?

312
00:17:05,517 --> 00:17:07,587
Like you wouldn't believe.

313
00:17:10,317 --> 00:17:12,148
Jerry, it's getting late.

314
00:17:12,597 --> 00:17:13,916
You cleaned up the car.

315
00:17:14,077 --> 00:17:16,432
You made all your phone calls.

316
00:17:16,597 --> 00:17:18,110
Why are you still here?

317
00:17:19,677 --> 00:17:22,271
Well, l maxed out my credit cards.

318
00:17:22,437 --> 00:17:25,747
And l don't have enough cash
for a hotel room.

319
00:17:25,917 --> 00:17:28,670
-So....
-You are thinking of staying here?

320
00:17:28,837 --> 00:17:32,034
-Well....
-You've got some nerve.

321
00:17:32,197 --> 00:17:35,553
l almost break my neck
in that death-trap of yours...

322
00:17:35,717 --> 00:17:37,708
...and now you ask me for a favour?

323
00:17:37,877 --> 00:17:41,233
-Didn't like that crack about the pen?
-l did not.

324
00:17:44,157 --> 00:17:46,148
Well, l've given this
a lot of thought...

325
00:17:46,317 --> 00:17:47,830
...and l've gotta say--

326
00:17:49,837 --> 00:17:52,397
As much as l'd like to see
the two of you living it up...

327
00:17:52,557 --> 00:17:55,230
...in a warm, tropical setting...

328
00:17:55,397 --> 00:17:57,069
...l would just miss you too much.

329
00:17:57,237 --> 00:17:59,626
So l've decided...

330
00:17:59,797 --> 00:18:02,675
...l want you to stay.

331
00:18:03,077 --> 00:18:04,351
lt's too late.

332
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:06,348
We bought a condo
at Del Boca Vista.

333
00:18:06,517 --> 00:18:08,269
We're leaving tonight.

334
00:18:10,157 --> 00:18:11,556
You said it was my call.

335
00:18:11,717 --> 00:18:13,753
We were just being nice.

336
00:18:15,157 --> 00:18:19,070
Cosmo, are you sure you're
gonna be all right here alone?

337
00:18:19,237 --> 00:18:21,353
Oh, yeah, l got Emily
coming over tonight.

338
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,109
You're letting him
have a woman over?

339
00:18:23,277 --> 00:18:25,552
He's not family.
lt's different psychologically.

340
00:18:30,477 --> 00:18:33,355
And so l made an explosive
out of chickpeas.

341
00:18:34,517 --> 00:18:36,872
And l stopped that great rhino
right in his tracks.

342
00:18:37,037 --> 00:18:39,232
-lt's getting late. Why don't we--
-Mr. Peterman...

343
00:18:39,397 --> 00:18:43,276
...that can't have been the only time
that you faced mortal danger.

344
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,396
Funny you should ask, Elaine.

345
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:47,627
lf we're gonna stay
till all hours of the night...

346
00:18:47,797 --> 00:18:49,594
...can't we at least
get some food here?

347
00:18:50,157 --> 00:18:51,875
lt's only 5: 1 5.

348
00:18:53,077 --> 00:18:55,068
So later on that same day...

349
00:18:55,237 --> 00:18:58,035
...l developed a great hankering
for some wild honey.

350
00:18:58,197 --> 00:18:59,391
Okay, l'm done.

351
00:18:59,557 --> 00:19:02,947
l'll be back in the morning when
he's close to finished with this story.

352
00:19:03,117 --> 00:19:04,709
Morty.

353
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:07,311
My stories
are what sell these clothes.

354
00:19:07,477 --> 00:19:09,707
Cheap fabric and dim lighting:

355
00:19:09,877 --> 00:19:11,868
That's how you move merchandise.

356
00:19:12,077 --> 00:19:13,476
Okay.

357
00:19:13,637 --> 00:19:15,150
You're out.

358
00:19:15,957 --> 00:19:18,630
l never knew what l was
peddling with those stupid cartoons...

359
00:19:18,797 --> 00:19:20,753
...and that paper book anyway.

360
00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:45,708
l don't know why l let you talk me
into that corned beef at Snitzers.

361
00:19:45,877 --> 00:19:48,391
-No one held a gun to your head.
-Yeah.

362
00:19:48,557 --> 00:19:50,787
Don't forget: We're eating
at the Fidermans' tomorrow.

363
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:52,868
Why do l have to go?
They're your friends.

364
00:19:53,037 --> 00:19:55,028
-You like them.
-l've had it with them.

365
00:19:56,757 --> 00:19:58,588
Then we won't go.

366
00:19:58,757 --> 00:20:00,588
Okay, okay. What time?

367
00:20:00,917 --> 00:20:02,669
Eight-thirty.

368
00:20:07,317 --> 00:20:08,636
That was all right.

369
00:20:17,397 --> 00:20:21,948
''One bright note in today's market
was the stock of retailer J. Peterman...

370
00:20:22,117 --> 00:20:25,154
...whose founder's surprise return
generated a rise...

371
00:20:25,317 --> 00:20:28,195
...of 1 2 and a half points.''

372
00:20:29,917 --> 00:20:32,112
That means if you still had
those stock options....

373
00:20:32,277 --> 00:20:33,995
Yeah.

374
00:20:34,637 --> 00:20:35,831
That's a shame.

375
00:20:36,357 --> 00:20:37,836
What are you, sticking it to me?

376
00:20:38,477 --> 00:20:40,672
-What?
-l think you're sticking it to me.

377
00:20:40,837 --> 00:20:42,634
l'm sure George
is just being sympathetic.

378
00:20:42,797 --> 00:20:44,628
Sticking it!

379
00:20:45,957 --> 00:20:47,788
You're not alone.
l'm practically broke.

380
00:20:47,957 --> 00:20:49,436
-Really?
-No.

381
00:20:49,597 --> 00:20:50,871
But...

382
00:20:51,037 --> 00:20:53,426
...l did blow over 20,000
on that Cadillac.

383
00:20:54,917 --> 00:20:56,111
Delicious.

384
00:20:56,277 --> 00:20:59,713
-You seem happy.
-Hey, the folks are 1 200 miles away.

385
00:20:59,877 --> 00:21:01,708
l'm basking in the buffer zone.

386
00:21:01,877 --> 00:21:03,595
Another piece of pie here.

387
00:21:04,117 --> 00:21:06,312
So were your parents shocked
to see the Cadillac?

388
00:21:06,477 --> 00:21:08,707
Actually, l haven't heard
from them yet.

389
00:21:08,917 --> 00:21:10,396
When are we gonna tell Jerry?

390
00:21:10,557 --> 00:21:11,956
l don't wanna worry him.

391
00:21:12,117 --> 00:21:14,551
We'll tell him next time we go up.

392
00:21:14,957 --> 00:21:17,551
He thought he could buy back
that Cadillac for us?

393
00:21:17,717 --> 00:21:19,673
He's not getting away with that.

394
00:21:20,117 --> 00:21:23,587
Besides, that condo
was too much house.

395
00:21:26,997 --> 00:21:29,716
How many times
can you check the car?

396
00:21:29,877 --> 00:21:32,072
l saw a bum sleeping
in the Cadillac the other day.

397
00:21:32,237 --> 00:21:35,832
Why would someone
break into a car to take a nap?

398
00:21:36,037 --> 00:21:37,948
They don't nap.
They make it their home.

399
00:21:38,117 --> 00:21:39,596
They urinate in there.

400
00:21:39,797 --> 00:21:41,469
You're driving me crazy.

401
00:21:41,637 --> 00:21:44,071
That's it. We're going back
to Queens. Where's my hat?

402
00:21:44,237 --> 00:21:46,228
No!
