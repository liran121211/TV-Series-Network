1
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:07,293
You seen commercials for
indigestion drugs? Pepcid AC.

2
00:00:07,459 --> 00:00:08,653
Tagamet HB?

3
00:00:08,819 --> 00:00:10,298
Country's sick to their stomachs.

4
00:00:10,459 --> 00:00:13,417
You know you're supposed to take
these things before you get sick?

5
00:00:13,579 --> 00:00:15,251
-What is this, a bit?
-No.

6
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:17,774
-Because l'm not in the mood.
-We're just talking.

7
00:00:17,939 --> 00:00:20,055
ls this not the greatest
marketing ploy ever?

8
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:22,130
lf you feel good,
you're supposed to take one.

9
00:00:22,299 --> 00:00:23,652
l know that tone. This is a bit.

10
00:00:23,819 --> 00:00:26,936
They've opened a whole new market.
Medication for the well.

11
00:00:27,099 --> 00:00:29,932
All right. Are you done
with your little amusement?

12
00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:31,532
Then you admit it was amusing?

13
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:34,532
lt was okay. But move the
''medication for the well'' to the front...

14
00:00:34,699 --> 00:00:36,178
...and hit the word ''good'' harder.

15
00:00:36,339 --> 00:00:38,136
Great. Thanks.

16
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:46,857
So your firm designed
all the furniture in here?

17
00:00:47,019 --> 00:00:48,850
Well, we manufacture it.

18
00:00:49,019 --> 00:00:51,055
The original designs
are by Karl Farbman.

19
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:52,971
Oh, Farbman.

20
00:00:53,139 --> 00:00:55,812
-Do you know Farbman?
-Love Farbman.

21
00:00:56,099 --> 00:00:59,091
Most people go their whole lives
without sitting in a Farbman.

22
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:01,489
Well, if you call that living.

23
00:01:04,779 --> 00:01:07,737
Wouldn't it be great if
Farbman designed shoes?

24
00:01:07,899 --> 00:01:11,653
Brett? Don't you think
that would be great? Brett?

25
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:13,855
After the song, babe.

26
00:01:15,139 --> 00:01:16,777
This song.

27
00:01:21,899 --> 00:01:23,457
So when do l meet this jerk?

28
00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:26,850
He's not a jerk, Jer.
He only works with Karl Farbman.

29
00:01:27,019 --> 00:01:28,975
-Who?
-l don't know. Some designer.

30
00:01:29,139 --> 00:01:31,528
Anyway, Brett
is so generous and sensitive.

31
00:01:31,699 --> 00:01:33,894
Last night he was moved
just listening to a song.

32
00:01:34,059 --> 00:01:35,458
-What song?
-'' Desperado.''

33
00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:37,496
'' Desperado''?
And you're still dating him?

34
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:39,536
l'll tell you who sounds
a little desperado.

35
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,890
See that salesman
twirling that umbrella?

36
00:01:43,059 --> 00:01:45,653
-l invented that.
-That had to be invented?

37
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:47,935
When l started out as a comedian,
l sold umbrellas.

38
00:01:48,099 --> 00:01:51,535
lt was my idea to twirl it
to attract customers.

39
00:01:51,699 --> 00:01:55,328
Oh, really? Well, why don't
we ask him about it?

40
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:57,730
-Elaine.
-Excuse me.

41
00:01:57,899 --> 00:01:59,252
Hey, how you doing?

42
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:03,298
My friend here says that he invented
that little twirl you're doing.

43
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:05,927
Elaine, please,
it was a long time ago.

44
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:07,851
The man doesn't want
a history lesson.

45
00:02:08,019 --> 00:02:09,896
Teddy Padilac
came up with this twirl.

46
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:12,052
l know Teddy Padilac.

47
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:14,449
l worked with him on 48th and Sixth.

48
00:02:14,619 --> 00:02:16,052
That's where he come up with it.

49
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,938
-ln his dreams.
-All right. Can we go?

50
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:22,808
By the way, you're doing it too fast.
You'll disorient the customers.

51
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:28,617
lt's the twirling that dazzles the eye.

52
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:31,290
l find it disorienting.

53
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:32,938
Who buys an umbrella anyway?

54
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:36,296
You can get them for free
in the coffee shop in the metal cans.

55
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:38,609
Those belong to people.

56
00:02:42,059 --> 00:02:45,972
Hey. Well, this was
downstairs for you.

57
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:47,697
Oh, no, not more checks.

58
00:02:47,859 --> 00:02:49,929
They're coming in faster
than l can sign them.

59
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:51,578
-What checks?
-Oh, you didn't hear?

60
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:53,536
Jerry's a big star in Japan.

61
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:55,377
Don't know why.
There's a clip of me...

62
00:02:55,539 --> 00:02:58,007
...in the credits of some
Japanese comedy.

63
00:02:58,179 --> 00:03:00,329
Yeah, The Super Terrific Happy Hour.

64
00:03:01,339 --> 00:03:04,251
They run it all the time. l'm starting
to get these royalty checks.

65
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:06,131
Look at all of those. You're rich.

66
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:08,017
No, each one is for like 1 2 cents.

67
00:03:08,179 --> 00:03:10,613
lt's barely worth the pain
in my hand to sign them.

68
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:19,097
Jerry, you need any new furniture?

69
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:21,011
-Why?
-Elaine's new boyfriend, you know...

70
00:03:21,179 --> 00:03:23,295
...he's giving me
this oversized chest of drawers.

71
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:25,495
-lt's a Farbman.
-He's giving you furniture?

72
00:03:25,659 --> 00:03:28,332
-Who is this guy?
-Who are any of her losers?

73
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:30,217
You're on that list.

74
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:33,817
l gotta go home and open up
the house for the carpet cleaners.

75
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:35,970
You know, they're doing
my whole place for $25?

76
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:39,017
Oh, no, no, no.
Not the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?

77
00:03:39,179 --> 00:03:41,773
-Yeah. You heard of them?
-They're a crazy religious cult.

78
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:45,614
The carpet cleaning is just a means
for them to get into your apartment.

79
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:48,976
So? For a $25 cleaning, l can listen
to some pointless blather.

80
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:51,448
l do it. l'm not even
getting the cleaning.

81
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:54,769
l signed over 1 00 checks
this morning.

82
00:03:54,939 --> 00:03:57,578
-Hello, $1 2.
-Excuse me.

83
00:03:57,819 --> 00:03:59,377
Would you take a picture, please.

84
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,177
Oh, yeah. Sure.

85
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:04,291
l'm gonna ask this guy something.

86
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:10,014
Hey, nice twirl you got there.

87
00:04:10,179 --> 00:04:11,897
You know who invented that,
don't you?

88
00:04:12,059 --> 00:04:14,015
-Hey, are you folks from Japan?
-Yes.

89
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:15,811
You recognize that mug?

90
00:04:15,979 --> 00:04:17,651
That's the funny face
that greets you...

91
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:20,049
...at the beginning of
The Super Terrific Happy Hour.

92
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:22,653
-Oh, Super Terrific!
-Yeah.

93
00:04:22,819 --> 00:04:24,616
Yeah, huh? Yeah, that's him.

94
00:04:25,059 --> 00:04:26,287
What is he doing?

95
00:04:26,659 --> 00:04:29,651
Well, l don't know,
but something super-terrific, l'm sure.

96
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:31,616
-That's funny.
-Oh, yeah, very funny.

97
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:35,055
And it wouldn't be impolite
to laugh at his antics.

98
00:04:36,939 --> 00:04:40,215
Yeah, that's it. Because everybody
laughs at Jerry here in America.

99
00:04:45,739 --> 00:04:47,172
We're pretty much finished.

100
00:04:48,219 --> 00:04:49,493
There's just one more thing.

101
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:51,570
Here it comes.

102
00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:56,607
You forgot to sign your check.

103
00:04:58,499 --> 00:04:59,932
Sorry.

104
00:05:01,179 --> 00:05:05,252
You sure there isn't anything else?

105
00:05:05,859 --> 00:05:07,417
No.

106
00:05:08,659 --> 00:05:10,490
So that's it?

107
00:05:10,659 --> 00:05:14,174
-Unless you need a receipt.
-l wish that was all l needed.

108
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:15,613
Life can be so confusing.

109
00:05:15,779 --> 00:05:17,576
l'm searching
for answers anywhere.

110
00:05:17,739 --> 00:05:19,411
Good luck with that.

111
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:26,696
Hey.

112
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:30,613
-What's with the claw?
-Super-terrific carpal tunnel syndrome.

113
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:33,248
-There's no sign of Kramer.
-Oh, Brett.

114
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:35,091
-This is Jerry.
-Hi.

115
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:38,372
That's very funny. Elaine told me
you're some kind of comedian.

116
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:40,370
l'm one kind.

117
00:05:41,179 --> 00:05:43,568
Have you seen the chest of drawers
Brett gave to Kramer?

118
00:05:43,739 --> 00:05:46,048
-Fleckman. Right.
-Farbman.

119
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:49,338
-You gotta see them. They're beautiful.
-l'm sure they are.

120
00:05:49,499 --> 00:05:52,332
l'd be happy to get you some,
if that's what you're driving at.

121
00:05:52,859 --> 00:05:55,976
-No, l'm fine. Thank you.
-Don't worry. lt's no charge to you.

122
00:05:56,139 --> 00:05:59,415
Looks like what you really need is
a decent desk for writing your skits.

123
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:00,978
l don't write skits.

124
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:03,573
Of course you don't.
You don't have a proper workstation.

125
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:05,252
l'll fax over my catalogue.

126
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:11,248
Brett, Jerry doesn't have
a fax machine.

127
00:06:14,099 --> 00:06:16,010
l'm sure things will pick up
for you soon.

128
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:19,217
Elaine, maybe we should get going.

129
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,574
-Wanna join us?
-Where you going, the coffee shop?

130
00:06:21,739 --> 00:06:25,095
The coffee shop? l think we can
do a little better than that.

131
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:28,217
You look like you could use
a solid meal at a real restaurant.

132
00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:31,412
-You look like you could use a--
-Jerry.

133
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:37,813
Three hundred dollars. Mr. Oh, how
much would these run you in Tokyo?

134
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:40,936
Those are 30,000 yen.

135
00:06:41,099 --> 00:06:42,896
Thirty thousand?

136
00:06:43,059 --> 00:06:45,414
Well, these are practically free.

137
00:06:46,059 --> 00:06:49,290
Giddy up. You're a cowboy now.

138
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:53,810
l feel terrible about
your friend Jerry.

139
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:56,209
He's upset that l gave Kramer
that chest of drawers.

140
00:06:56,379 --> 00:06:57,732
Why do you think he's upset?

141
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:01,050
Well, how could he not be? Living in
that cramped little apartment...

142
00:07:01,219 --> 00:07:05,258
...that outdated furniture,
so terribly un-Karl-Farbman-like.

143
00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:09,492
We're not gonna talk about
Karl Farbman all night, are we?

144
00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:11,217
l hope not.

145
00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:17,812
Brett, is everything all right?

146
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:19,977
What is it?
ls there someone outside?

147
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:21,658
Elaine, the song.

148
00:07:25,659 --> 00:07:27,809
For a minute, l thought
it was that urban legend...

149
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:29,970
...about the guy with the hook
hanging on the--

150
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:32,812
Elaine, could you just not talk
for one minute?

151
00:07:33,939 --> 00:07:35,418
Sorry.

152
00:07:41,299 --> 00:07:42,857
-No spiel?
-Not a peep.

153
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:44,771
They just cleaned the carpets
and left.

154
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:46,895
They call themselves a cult.

155
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:50,058
So you're angry
that this bizarre carpet cabal...

156
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:51,652
...made no attempt to abduct you?

157
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:53,491
They could have at least tried.

158
00:07:53,859 --> 00:07:56,453
Maybe they thought you looked
too smart to be brainwashed.

159
00:07:56,619 --> 00:07:58,257
-Please.
-Too dumb?

160
00:08:00,219 --> 00:08:04,531
Well, Mackie's back in town.
Nice duds.

161
00:08:05,299 --> 00:08:07,290
Yeah, it's a gift
from my Japanese friends.

162
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:09,097
They're known as gift-givers.

163
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:11,819
And tonight, we're going dancing
at the Rainbow Room.

164
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:14,335
Sounds like you're throwing
their money around.

165
00:08:14,499 --> 00:08:16,455
Well, Jerry, they're Japanese.

166
00:08:16,619 --> 00:08:18,894
l mean, that TV you watch,
that sushi you eat...

167
00:08:19,059 --> 00:08:20,378
...even that kimono you wear...

168
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:22,734
...where do you think
all that money goes?

169
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:24,817
That's right.

170
00:08:24,979 --> 00:08:26,412
How'd you hook up with
these guys?

171
00:08:26,579 --> 00:08:29,047
They recognized Jerry from
The Super Terrific Happy Hour.

172
00:08:29,219 --> 00:08:31,255
See, you should be doing
your own show in Japan.

173
00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:32,613
Now, they get you.

174
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:34,497
What kind of show am l gonna do
in Japan?

175
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:36,456
What did you do with
that pilot you did?

176
00:08:36,619 --> 00:08:38,450
Yeah, the pilot.

177
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:40,450
Right. That had
marvellous production values.

178
00:08:40,619 --> 00:08:42,530
l do a lot of business with
Japanese TV.

179
00:08:42,699 --> 00:08:44,496
They broadcast
a lot of American baseball.

180
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:46,297
They got an office here
in New York.

181
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:49,178
Forget it. The pilot was awful.
lt failed.

182
00:08:49,339 --> 00:08:51,899
lt failed here. Because here
every time you turn on a TV...

183
00:08:52,059 --> 00:08:54,937
...all you see is four morons
sitting around an apartment...

184
00:08:55,099 --> 00:08:56,532
...whining about their dates.

185
00:08:56,699 --> 00:08:59,816
See, George is right, Jerry.
See, here you're just another apple.

186
00:08:59,979 --> 00:09:05,178
But in Japan, you're an exotic fruit,
like an orange, which is rare there.

187
00:09:09,099 --> 00:09:10,293
You had a date?

188
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:13,690
You went out with my butler? Who
said you could go out with my butler?

189
00:09:13,859 --> 00:09:17,647
-Why do I need your permission?
-Because he's my butler.

190
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:24,490
So, what do you think?

191
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:26,650
We're a bit confused.

192
00:09:26,819 --> 00:09:29,811
Why was this man Jerry's butler?

193
00:09:30,499 --> 00:09:33,138
You see, the man
who is the butler...

194
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:36,211
...had gotten into
a car accident with Jerry.

195
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:39,052
And because he didn't have
any insurance...

196
00:09:39,219 --> 00:09:43,337
...the judge decreed that
the man become Jerry's butler.

197
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,933
ls this customary in
your legal system?

198
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:50,133
No. That's what makes it
such a humorous situation.

199
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:04,211
l'm sorry. l'm sure Mr. Seinfeld is
very funny to Americans.

200
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:08,850
But l'm not sure this butler show
would work in Japan.

201
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:10,657
Oh, l-- l disagree.

202
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:13,731
You've-- You've been living
in America too long.

203
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:17,812
You've forgotten what it's like
to have no oranges.

204
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:24,537
Sorry. My hand is numb.

205
00:10:24,699 --> 00:10:29,489
Yes, from endorsing checks for
The Super Terrific Happy Hour.

206
00:10:29,659 --> 00:10:32,173
You must go.

207
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:38,771
Well, l think
l'm on the outs with Brett.

208
00:10:39,379 --> 00:10:41,495
l got shushed during '' Desperado.''

209
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:44,693
What does he listen to,
the all '' Desperado'' station?

210
00:10:45,339 --> 00:10:48,536
He is just in his own world
when he hears that song.

211
00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:53,295
lt's like l'm sitting there in the car,
and he's out riding fences.

212
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:55,575
You know, what you need is
a song you can share.

213
00:10:56,139 --> 00:11:00,018
Yeah, you're right.
We need to find our song.

214
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:03,091
Okay. So is there any song
that you feel very strongly about?

215
00:11:05,979 --> 00:11:07,207
l like ''Witchy Woman.''

216
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:09,973
-''Witchy Woman''?
-You know, ''Witchy Woman.''

217
00:11:12,859 --> 00:11:14,292
Oh, ''Witchy Woman.''

218
00:11:16,099 --> 00:11:17,293
-Hey, Elaine.
-Hey.

219
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:19,017
Hey, how was the Rainbow Room?

220
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,578
Well, we-- We had to leave early.

221
00:11:20,739 --> 00:11:24,857
There was a slight monetary
discrepancy regarding the bill.

222
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:27,738
-Listen, could l borrow some pillows?
-What for?

223
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:30,618
Well, my Japanese friends
are gonna stay with me.

224
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:32,849
l thought they all had suites
at the Plaza.

225
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:37,815
Well, l'm sorry, Jerry. We all don't
have checks rolling in like you do.

226
00:11:37,979 --> 00:11:41,176
Well, what about all that money
from the kimonos l wear?

227
00:11:42,019 --> 00:11:43,372
Well, they ran out of it.

228
00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:47,248
l mean, Manhattan can be quite
pricey, even with 50,000 yen.

229
00:11:47,419 --> 00:11:50,889
Fifty thousand yen?
lsn't that only a few hundred dollars?

230
00:11:51,259 --> 00:11:52,897
Evidently.

231
00:11:54,139 --> 00:11:57,017
Oh, by the way, tell Brett that
his chest of drawers are a big hit.

232
00:11:57,179 --> 00:11:59,329
My guests are
very comfortable in them.

233
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:01,217
ln them?

234
00:12:02,379 --> 00:12:04,654
You have them sleeping in drawers?

235
00:12:04,859 --> 00:12:08,090
Jerry, have you ever seen
the business hotels in Tokyo?

236
00:12:08,259 --> 00:12:11,171
They sleep in tiny,
stacked cubicles all the time.

237
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:14,217
-They feel right at home.
-This has international incident...

238
00:12:14,379 --> 00:12:16,688
-...written all over it.
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

239
00:12:20,979 --> 00:12:23,857
-Good night, Mr. Tanaka.
-Good night.

240
00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:26,579
-Good night, Mr. Oh.
-Good night.

241
00:12:27,499 --> 00:12:29,694
Good night, Mr. Yamaguchi.

242
00:12:40,939 --> 00:12:43,089
-What is this?
-Rice Krispies.

243
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:44,658
East meets West, Jerry.

244
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:48,816
That's a lovely little
bureau-and-breakfast you're running.

245
00:12:48,979 --> 00:12:50,207
Well, l'm off to the bank.

246
00:12:56,259 --> 00:12:57,578
Elaine, l--

247
00:12:57,939 --> 00:12:59,338
What do you think?

248
00:13:01,059 --> 00:13:02,333
What are you doing?

249
00:13:02,499 --> 00:13:05,013
That's ''Witchy Woman.''
l thought it could be our song.

250
00:13:05,739 --> 00:13:08,537
''Witchy Woman'' is okay for you,
but l've already got a song.

251
00:13:09,099 --> 00:13:10,930
Oh, well, then how about
'' Desperado''?

252
00:13:11,099 --> 00:13:12,373
We can share it.

253
00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:14,968
No. lt's mine.

254
00:13:18,939 --> 00:13:22,249
Here you go.
Snap, crackle and pop.

255
00:13:26,299 --> 00:13:30,053
Good morning, Mr. Oh.
l gotta make up the drawer.

256
00:13:30,219 --> 00:13:32,494
Come back in half-hour.

257
00:13:40,059 --> 00:13:42,732
-Hey, l'll take one.
-Well, look who's back.

258
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:46,130
Teddy, this is the guy says
he invented the twirl.

259
00:13:46,499 --> 00:13:48,171
Jerry Seinfeld.

260
00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:50,569
Teddy Padilac, long time, no see.

261
00:13:50,739 --> 00:13:52,331
What do you got
in a push-button mini?

262
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:55,491
Same thing we had when
you bailed on us 1 5 years ago.

263
00:13:55,659 --> 00:13:58,457
Bailed? Come on, you knew
l wanted to be a comedian.

264
00:13:58,619 --> 00:14:01,656
Besides, we had some good times.
Remember Tropical Storm Renee?

265
00:14:01,819 --> 00:14:04,891
Oh, yeah, sure. But where were you
during the poncho craze of '84?

266
00:14:05,059 --> 00:14:06,697
l almost lost my house.

267
00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:08,852
Umbrella, buddy?

268
00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:11,772
Now we got that damn
urban sombrero to contend with.

269
00:14:11,939 --> 00:14:13,133
Easy, Clicky.

270
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:15,210
l hear you're taking credit
for the twirl.

271
00:14:15,379 --> 00:14:17,495
Oh, it's so many years ago.
Who cares?

272
00:14:17,659 --> 00:14:20,127
l care. Clicky cares.

273
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:23,735
-Look, could l just buy an umbrella?
-Yeah, sure.

274
00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:25,651
-Two hundred dollars.
-What?

275
00:14:25,819 --> 00:14:28,379
Special price for a real
foul-weather friend.

276
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:35,493
Hey, George. All right,
how about that tour, huh?

277
00:14:35,659 --> 00:14:37,490
These guys are ready to
run the bases.

278
00:14:37,659 --> 00:14:40,935
Kramer, it's-- lt's raining.
They got the tarp on the field.

279
00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:44,254
Listen, George, what else
can l do with these guys?

280
00:14:44,419 --> 00:14:46,535
Bear in mind,
they're a little light on the yen.

281
00:14:47,939 --> 00:14:50,294
Well, l-- l got the pilot
of the Jerry show.

282
00:14:50,499 --> 00:14:52,967
That's perfect.
How would you guys like to watch...

283
00:14:53,139 --> 00:14:55,972
...the Super Terrific Happy star,
Jerry Seinfeld?

284
00:14:56,139 --> 00:14:58,289
But we are also very hungry.

285
00:14:58,459 --> 00:15:01,053
Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, you guys
just watch the tape...

286
00:15:01,219 --> 00:15:02,732
...and l'll get you some food.

287
00:15:02,899 --> 00:15:04,730
-Go ahead. Yeah.
-Please.

288
00:15:04,899 --> 00:15:06,890
Hey, peanuts!

289
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:09,330
George. George, got a minute?

290
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:11,655
George, did you call some
carpet cleaners?

291
00:15:11,859 --> 00:15:13,929
-Are they here?
-They're in my office right now.

292
00:15:14,099 --> 00:15:16,374
-They haven't said anything to you?
-About what?

293
00:15:16,539 --> 00:15:18,928
What kind of a snobby,
stuck-up cult is this?

294
00:15:25,979 --> 00:15:29,130
-Hey, Jerry.
-Oh, hi, Brett.

295
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:30,891
Haven't you ever
heard of an umbrella?

296
00:15:31,059 --> 00:15:32,697
l didn't have enough money.

297
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:36,216
-Sure things will pick up for you.
-No, it's not that. lt's....

298
00:15:38,179 --> 00:15:41,967
Oh, no. Look at the checks.
Hours of hard work ruined.

299
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:45,176
Don't worry.
l can spot you the 1 2 cents.

300
00:15:45,339 --> 00:15:46,533
No. lt's not the money.

301
00:15:46,699 --> 00:15:49,611
lt's my hand.
lt's crippled from writing and writing.

302
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:51,337
Nothing's working for you, is it?

303
00:15:51,499 --> 00:15:52,932
Not at the moment, Brett.

304
00:15:53,099 --> 00:15:55,488
l'd give you a ride,
but l got Karl Farbman here.

305
00:15:56,819 --> 00:15:58,457
Thanks for stopping.

306
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:03,171
Brett said you ran away from him
as if he were the boogity man?

307
00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:04,533
Bogeyman.

308
00:16:05,739 --> 00:16:07,889
-Boogie?
-l'm quite sure.

309
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:11,255
Anyway, any luck
getting together on a song?

310
00:16:11,419 --> 00:16:13,979
No. He blew out my
''Witchy Woman.''

311
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,731
And he won't share '' Desperado.''

312
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:17,730
Hey, what do you think of
''Oye Como Va''?

313
00:16:18,939 --> 00:16:21,612
Well, l'm running out of guys
here in this city, Jer.

314
00:16:24,419 --> 00:16:25,977
Hey, great news.

315
00:16:26,139 --> 00:16:29,495
l showed the pilot to Kramer's
Japanese friends. They loved it!

316
00:16:29,659 --> 00:16:31,536
Really? They bought
the butler character?

317
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:34,293
Did l tell you that story's relatable?
That was a great show.

318
00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:36,495
That is why l'm bringing it
back to NBC.

319
00:16:36,659 --> 00:16:38,854
-NBC?
-Nakahama Broadcast Corporation.

320
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:43,409
But they told us we must go now.

321
00:16:43,579 --> 00:16:46,013
Yeah, but now l have
my own market research.

322
00:16:46,179 --> 00:16:48,693
Actual Japanese viewers
that loved the show.

323
00:16:48,859 --> 00:16:51,168
-l'm gonna talk to Kramer.
-Hey, George, do me a favour.

324
00:16:51,339 --> 00:16:54,456
lf they make you an offer,
whatever it is, just take it.

325
00:16:56,859 --> 00:17:00,169
Hey, by the way
what'd you think of Miss Yoshimura?

326
00:17:00,339 --> 00:17:01,897
-Who?
-The network executive.

327
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:03,970
Do you think she liked me?

328
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:16,250
Hey, look at who's here!

329
00:17:16,419 --> 00:17:18,296
George, come on in. Come on.

330
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:20,575
-l want you to come in here.
-Come on in, fat boy!

331
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:23,731
Get a good night's sleep,
all right, fellas? Big day tomorrow.

332
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:25,818
All right.

333
00:17:31,899 --> 00:17:33,537
Last one.

334
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,811
Here you are.

335
00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:43,330
-Where's the boys?
-No, l let them sleep in.

336
00:17:43,499 --> 00:17:45,808
l'm on my way to cash in
their plane tickets for them.

337
00:17:45,979 --> 00:17:47,412
They need a little food money.

338
00:17:47,579 --> 00:17:50,616
-The meeting starts in 1 0 minutes.
-Well, l set their alarm.

339
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:53,168
But they did have a lot of sake
in that hot tub.

340
00:17:53,499 --> 00:17:54,898
l'm calling Jerry.

341
00:17:59,099 --> 00:18:00,293
-Yeah?
-Jerry!

342
00:18:00,459 --> 00:18:02,131
The Japanese guys had sake
in the hot tub.

343
00:18:02,299 --> 00:18:03,652
You gotta get them down here...

344
00:18:03,819 --> 00:18:06,287
...or l don't have a focus group
to sell the pilot.

345
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:08,928
Uncle Leo?

346
00:18:09,099 --> 00:18:10,293
Jerry!

347
00:18:11,219 --> 00:18:13,653
All right, all right. l'll wake them up.

348
00:18:14,739 --> 00:18:16,138
Testy.

349
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:20,898
Hello?

350
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:25,530
-Mr. Jerry, open the drawer, please.
-lt's stuck.

351
00:18:26,619 --> 00:18:28,894
The steam from the hot tub
must have warped the wood.

352
00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:30,777
-Pull harder.
-l'm trying.

353
00:18:30,939 --> 00:18:33,737
l can't get a grip.
My hand's had kind of a bad week.

354
00:18:33,899 --> 00:18:35,730
Very funny. But no joking, please.

355
00:18:36,259 --> 00:18:37,578
Don't worry, l'll get you out.

356
00:18:38,339 --> 00:18:40,569
Brett, believe me,
you don't have to do this.

357
00:18:40,739 --> 00:18:42,616
Elaine, l know he'll appreciate this.

358
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:45,339
lt's not as nice
as Kramer's cabinets, but it's a start.

359
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:49,208
Well, l promise you, Jerry is not
jealous of Kramer's cabinets.

360
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:51,529
Move to the back of the drawers!

361
00:18:51,699 --> 00:18:53,337
Jerry?

362
00:18:53,819 --> 00:18:55,093
Jerry.

363
00:18:55,539 --> 00:18:57,973
Not the Farbman!

364
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:26,057
So, gentlemen, we have a deal?

365
00:19:37,819 --> 00:19:40,936
Excuse me. Did you hire
the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?

366
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:46,008
Yes. To clean up the coffee stain
left by Jerry Seinfeld.

367
00:19:49,219 --> 00:19:53,974
Mr.... Mr. Wilhelm, what...?
What are you doing here?

368
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:56,215
l'm here to clean the carpets.

369
00:19:56,379 --> 00:20:01,453
Most of the world is carpeted,
and one day, we will do the cleaning.

370
00:20:04,659 --> 00:20:06,138
Him, you brainwashed?

371
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:07,732
What's he got that l don't have?

372
00:20:10,219 --> 00:20:11,811
Mr. Wilhelm, you've been abducted.

373
00:20:11,979 --> 00:20:13,651
Mr. Wilhelm, you gotta listen to me.

374
00:20:13,819 --> 00:20:15,411
Wilhelm?

375
00:20:16,819 --> 00:20:19,379
My name is Tanya.

376
00:20:35,419 --> 00:20:37,250
Brett, l'm-- l'm really sorry.

377
00:20:37,459 --> 00:20:40,690
l didn't mean to hit you
in the head with an axe.

378
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:44,290
At least it was just a handle.

379
00:20:44,659 --> 00:20:46,138
Those beautiful cabinets.

380
00:20:46,699 --> 00:20:48,451
What am l gonna tell--?

381
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:51,213
-l can't remember his name.
-Fleckman?

382
00:20:51,379 --> 00:20:52,653
Calm down, Brett. Okay?

383
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:56,289
You could have a concussion.
Calm down.

384
00:21:16,939 --> 00:21:19,658
-His pulse is fine.
-Looks like a minor concussion.

385
00:21:19,819 --> 00:21:22,811
Let me see what l can do
to relieve the swelling.

386
00:21:25,699 --> 00:21:27,417
Doctor?

387
00:21:28,659 --> 00:21:30,058
Doctor?

388
00:21:31,099 --> 00:21:32,817
Doctor?

389
00:21:34,659 --> 00:21:37,332
Doctor, l think we're losing him.
