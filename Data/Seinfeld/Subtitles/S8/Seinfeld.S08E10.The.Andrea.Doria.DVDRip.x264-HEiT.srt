1
00:00:05,059 --> 00:00:06,128
Hey, you know what?

2
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:08,449
lt says '' no food or drink.''
Can't take that in.

3
00:00:08,619 --> 00:00:11,417
-Just wait here. l'll be right out.
-Wait a second. Come on.

4
00:00:13,339 --> 00:00:15,091
l wanna go in.

5
00:00:18,459 --> 00:00:20,017
l'm just running in.

6
00:00:22,339 --> 00:00:23,738
Come on. Come on.

7
00:00:38,619 --> 00:00:40,814
You know what?
They don't have batteries here.

8
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:42,776
Let's go.

9
00:00:49,099 --> 00:00:51,090
Hey, Georgie's moving out.

10
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,090
-Get out.
-l'm out.

11
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:55,853
Fantastic apartment
right across from mine.

12
00:00:56,019 --> 00:00:57,247
l can't wait for you to see.

13
00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:00,207
-ls it better than mine?
-Oh, yeah.

14
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:03,931
So it's a two-bedroom-one-bath-
make-your-friends-hate-you.

15
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:05,248
lt's better than Elaine's.

16
00:01:05,419 --> 00:01:06,932
-Gotta give her a call.
-She's out.

17
00:01:07,099 --> 00:01:10,136
-Right, the blind date.
-Well, they like to call it a setup now.

18
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:13,894
l guess the blind people don't like
being associated with all those losers.

19
00:01:14,059 --> 00:01:15,731
Come on,
come check out my new place.

20
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:19,137
l can't. l'm meeting Kramer
down at my Mini Storage.

21
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:20,573
Got any extra furniture there?

22
00:01:20,739 --> 00:01:24,129
l need some more stuff to fill that
extra bedroom with a walk-in closet.

23
00:01:24,579 --> 00:01:26,251
Oh, this is really annoying.

24
00:01:27,019 --> 00:01:28,577
lt's working already.

25
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:34,294
What is with that?

26
00:01:34,779 --> 00:01:36,212
Well, it's coughing, Jerry.

27
00:01:36,379 --> 00:01:39,974
lt expels the diseased germs
out of the body into the air.

28
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:44,176
-Where is your key?
-Yeah, well, Newman-- He's got it.

29
00:01:44,339 --> 00:01:46,933
You know, Kramer,
l rented out half of my space to you.

30
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:50,091
Yeah, and l rented out half that space
to Newman.

31
00:01:56,539 --> 00:01:57,733
Mailbags?

32
00:01:57,899 --> 00:01:59,332
He's storing mail in here?

33
00:01:59,499 --> 00:02:01,330
Evidently.

34
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:03,493
Excuse me, George?

35
00:02:04,059 --> 00:02:05,333
No menus.

36
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:09,933
No, l'm Mrs. Ricardi,
president of the tenants' association.

37
00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:12,169
Oh, right. Right. Hey.

38
00:02:12,339 --> 00:02:14,614
l love the floors in here.
lt's like a gymnasium.

39
00:02:14,779 --> 00:02:17,532
-Try and guard me. Come on.
-No, no.

40
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:22,655
George, unfortunately,
Clarence Eldridge, in 8C...

41
00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:25,014
...has decided
that he wants the apartment.

42
00:02:25,619 --> 00:02:27,257
Yeah, but you promised it to me.

43
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:31,731
Yes, but you see, Mr. Eldridge
is an Andrea Doria survivor.

44
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:36,008
And in light of the terrible suffering
that he's already been through...

45
00:02:36,179 --> 00:02:37,976
...we've decided to give it to him.

46
00:02:38,779 --> 00:02:40,371
Well...

47
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:41,972
...the Andrea Doria.

48
00:02:42,739 --> 00:02:44,058
That was quite a fire.

49
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,928
-Shipwreck.
-l remember it.

50
00:02:52,779 --> 00:02:56,055
Where is this guy? I hate this.

51
00:02:56,379 --> 00:02:58,734
I should have brought something
to read.

52
00:03:00,699 --> 00:03:03,338
''Cancer in laboratory animals. ''

53
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:05,778
Excuse me. Elaine Benes?

54
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:07,691
-Yeah?
-An Alan Mercer called for you.

55
00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:10,578
He said he's sorry,
but he won't be able to make it tonight.

56
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:12,172
He's been stabbed.

57
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:15,728
Stabbed?

58
00:03:16,539 --> 00:03:18,052
More bread?

59
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:23,578
You ate more bread?

60
00:03:25,499 --> 00:03:26,932
That is not the point.

61
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:28,498
The guy was stabbed.

62
00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:30,297
-You find out who stabbed him?
-Yeah.

63
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:33,098
lt turns out it was his ex-girlfriend.

64
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:36,688
Well, you're not going near
this hooligan anymore.

65
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:39,730
l don't know.
l mean, think about it, Jerry.

66
00:03:39,899 --> 00:03:42,049
There must be something exciting
about this guy...

67
00:03:42,219 --> 00:03:45,814
...if he can arouse
that kind of passion.

68
00:03:47,859 --> 00:03:50,976
l mean, to be stabworthy,
you know? lt's....

69
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:54,529
lt's kind of a compliment.

70
00:03:55,699 --> 00:03:58,611
Yeah, too bad he didn't get shot.
He could have been the one.

71
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:01,973
Hey, how's everybody?

72
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:03,254
-Hey.
-Hey.

73
00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:07,219
There's no expiration date on this.

74
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:09,733
There is now.

75
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:13,968
You should get that cough
checked out by a doctor.

76
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:16,369
No, no, no. No doctors for me.

77
00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:20,578
Bunch of lackeys and yes men
all toeing the company line.

78
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:24,017
Plus they botched my vasectomy.

79
00:04:24,179 --> 00:04:26,613
-They botched it?
-l'm even more potent now.

80
00:04:29,739 --> 00:04:32,094
-Hey.
-Hey, how's the new place?

81
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:33,453
Gone.

82
00:04:33,619 --> 00:04:36,213
The tenant association
made me give it to this guy...

83
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:38,529
...because he was
an Andrea Doria survivor.

84
00:04:39,219 --> 00:04:41,574
Andrea Doria? ls that the one
they did the song about?

85
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:43,297
Edmund Fitzgerald.

86
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:46,735
l love Edmund Fitzgerald's voice.

87
00:04:47,779 --> 00:04:51,567
No, Gordon Lightfoot was the singer.
Edmund Fitzgerald was the ship.

88
00:04:51,739 --> 00:04:53,730
You could fit 1 5 people
in that bathroom.

89
00:04:53,899 --> 00:04:55,890
l think Gordon Lightfoot
was the boat.

90
00:04:56,059 --> 00:04:58,698
Yeah, and it was rammed
by the Cat Stevens.

91
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:02,019
The Andrea Doria collided
with the Stockholm in dense fog...

92
00:05:02,179 --> 00:05:04,898
...1 2 miles off the coast
of Nantucket.

93
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:10,297
-How do you know?
-lt's in my book:

94
00:05:10,459 --> 00:05:12,973
Astonishing Tales of the Sea.

95
00:05:14,619 --> 00:05:16,132
Fifty-one people died.

96
00:05:16,299 --> 00:05:18,415
Fifty-one people?

97
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:20,171
That's it?

98
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:22,376
l thought it was like a thousand.

99
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:25,007
There were 1 660 survivors.

100
00:05:25,179 --> 00:05:27,090
That's no tragedy.

101
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:31,332
How many people you lose
on a normal cruise, 30, 40?

102
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:32,818
Can l look at that book?

103
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:34,935
Oh, yeah.
l also got Astounding Bear Attacks.

104
00:05:35,099 --> 00:05:37,977
Before you go, did you talk to Newman
about getting that mail out?

105
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:39,857
Oh, yeah. No, he's not gonna do it.

106
00:05:47,179 --> 00:05:50,137
-Newman?
-l guess.

107
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:53,173
Listen, l want you to get the mail
out of my storage unit.

108
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:56,137
Sometimes we don't get
what we want.

109
00:05:56,299 --> 00:05:59,097
-What are you talking about?
-l didn't get my transfer.

110
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:01,614
-Transfer?
-To Hawaii.

111
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:04,498
The most sought after postal route
of them all.

112
00:06:04,659 --> 00:06:08,857
The air is so dewy sweet, you don't
even have to lick the stamps.

113
00:06:09,299 --> 00:06:12,371
But it's not to be.
So l'm hanging it up.

114
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,099
-You quit the post office?
-Kind of.

115
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:18,774
l'm still collecting checks,
l'm just not delivering mail.

116
00:06:20,219 --> 00:06:22,449
Well, get it out of my storage.
lt's illegal.

117
00:06:22,619 --> 00:06:25,008
And yet it's perfectly legal
to take a man's soul...

118
00:06:25,179 --> 00:06:27,329
...and crush it out
like a stale Pall Mall.

119
00:06:27,499 --> 00:06:29,455
Well, the law's the law.

120
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:35,734
Hold on there, it's....

121
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:38,459
-lt's a nasty cough you got there.
-What cough?

122
00:06:43,619 --> 00:06:45,974
l love shrimp. l'm a shrimp eater.

123
00:06:46,499 --> 00:06:50,378
You put shrimp in front of me,
and l'll eat it till my stomach pops.

124
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:55,210
No, it's okay.
l'm still just a little bit jumpy.

125
00:06:55,899 --> 00:06:57,651
Between you and me...

126
00:06:57,819 --> 00:06:59,935
...what happened there,
with the stabbing?

127
00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:02,533
Just one of those things, you know.

128
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:04,735
What, was she just so crazy
in love with you...

129
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:06,776
...she just couldn't take it
anymore, or...?

130
00:07:06,939 --> 00:07:08,691
l don't know. Could be.

131
00:07:09,339 --> 00:07:10,852
-Alan?
-Carol?

132
00:07:15,179 --> 00:07:17,488
Was that the one?
Was that the one who stabbed you?

133
00:07:17,659 --> 00:07:18,933
No, that was a different girl.

134
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:24,215
There was another
crazed ex-girlfriend?

135
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:27,257
Right. So l called my friend--
You know, the one who set us up?

136
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:30,138
l found out
he's a bad breaker-upper.

137
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:32,857
-Bad how?
-You know when you break up...

138
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,611
...how you say things
you don't mean?

139
00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:36,258
He says things you don't mean...

140
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:37,693
-...but means them.
-l follow.

141
00:07:37,859 --> 00:07:39,338
-What are you gonna do?
-Dump him.

142
00:07:39,499 --> 00:07:41,729
l can't be with someone
who doesn't break up nicely.

143
00:07:41,899 --> 00:07:44,015
That's an important part
of a relationship.

144
00:07:44,179 --> 00:07:45,692
What's more important?

145
00:07:49,859 --> 00:07:51,451
Hey.

146
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:53,810
-What's with the dog?
-This is Smuckers.

147
00:07:53,979 --> 00:07:55,571
l borrowed him.

148
00:07:58,939 --> 00:08:00,736
Yeah, we share the same affliction.

149
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:02,457
l'm gonna have a vet check us out.

150
00:08:02,619 --> 00:08:05,770
-A vet?
-l'll take a vet over an MD any day.

151
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:09,898
They gotta cure a lizard, a chicken,
a pig, a frog, all on the same day.

152
00:08:10,059 --> 00:08:13,017
So if l may jump ahead...

153
00:08:13,179 --> 00:08:14,771
...you're gonna take dog medicine?

154
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:17,169
You bet we are. How smart is that?

155
00:08:18,379 --> 00:08:20,051
See you.

156
00:08:23,499 --> 00:08:25,171
Ahoy, Mr. Eldridge.

157
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:30,375
l understand you were on
the Andrea Doria.

158
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:32,689
Yes, it was a terrifying ordeal.

159
00:08:32,859 --> 00:08:36,693
l tell you, l hear people really stuff
themselves on those cruise ships.

160
00:08:36,859 --> 00:08:40,215
The buffet, that's the real ordeal,
huh, Clarence?

161
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:41,812
We had to abandon ship.

162
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:45,176
Well, all vacations
have to end eventually.

163
00:08:45,739 --> 00:08:46,933
The boat sank.

164
00:08:47,099 --> 00:08:49,897
According to this,
it took 1 0 hours.

165
00:08:50,059 --> 00:08:53,256
lt eased into the water like an old man
into a nice warm bath. No offence.

166
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:57,333
So, Clarence, how about...

167
00:08:57,499 --> 00:09:00,059
...abandoning this apartment
and letting me shove off in it?

168
00:09:00,219 --> 00:09:01,538
ls that what this is about?

169
00:09:02,379 --> 00:09:03,732
l don't think l like you.

170
00:09:06,019 --> 00:09:08,214
lt's my apartment, Eldridge.

171
00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:11,689
The Stockholm
may not have sunk you, but l will.

172
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:15,253
What are the symptoms?

173
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:17,933
Well, it hurts when he swallows...

174
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,215
...especially when he drinks
orange juice.

175
00:09:20,379 --> 00:09:22,847
l mean, dog-food juice.

176
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:25,089
And what's worse,
he has a nagging cough.

177
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,210
That's it. That's it.

178
00:09:28,659 --> 00:09:30,854
Yeah, well, we've been seeing
a lot of this lately.

179
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:32,691
Been drinking from the toilet?

180
00:09:32,859 --> 00:09:35,498
What? No.

181
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:38,131
That's disgusting.

182
00:09:40,099 --> 00:09:41,657
So that's it? We're breaking up?

183
00:09:41,819 --> 00:09:43,013
What? Breakup?

184
00:09:43,179 --> 00:09:46,455
-We went out on one date.
-Okay, yeah, sure, whatever you say.

185
00:09:47,299 --> 00:09:48,971
All right. Good, good.

186
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:52,017
Okay, then, well....
So l'll see you around...

187
00:09:52,179 --> 00:09:53,658
...big head.

188
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:57,098
-Pardon?
-You got a big head.

189
00:09:57,259 --> 00:09:58,612
lt's too big for your body.

190
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:01,733
That's it?

191
00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:05,609
That's the best you got?

192
00:10:06,819 --> 00:10:09,652
So he's keeping the apartment.
He doesn't deserve it, though.

193
00:10:09,819 --> 00:10:11,889
lf he did suffer,
that was like 40 years ago.

194
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:13,492
What have you done
for me lately?

195
00:10:13,659 --> 00:10:17,174
l've been suffering for the past 30
years up to and including yesterday.

196
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:19,216
lf this board is impressed
with suffering...

197
00:10:19,379 --> 00:10:22,337
...maybe you should tell them
the astonishing tales of Costanza.

198
00:10:24,939 --> 00:10:28,295
-l should.
-Your work in this field is unparalleled.

199
00:10:28,459 --> 00:10:30,768
l could go bummer-to-bummer
with anyone on the planet.

200
00:10:30,939 --> 00:10:32,531
You're the man.

201
00:10:35,099 --> 00:10:37,897
-Jerry--
-l'll be with you in a moment.

202
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:41,969
So you want a protein shake
or something?

203
00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:44,256
l guess l should get moving
on this, huh?

204
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:46,330
-l'm gonna go.
-All right.

205
00:10:48,379 --> 00:10:49,528
Hello, Newman.

206
00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:51,849
-That mail, where is it?
-What's the difference?

207
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,975
The guy with the Hawaii transfer
got busted...

208
00:10:54,139 --> 00:10:56,095
...for hoarding
Victoria's Secret catalogs.

209
00:10:57,379 --> 00:10:58,858
l gotta deliver that mail.

210
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:00,850
Well, go ahead.
There's eight bags of it.

211
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:02,418
Blast.

212
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:06,652
There's no way l can handle eight
in addition to my usual load of one.

213
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:09,017
l'll never get to Hawaii.

214
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:11,568
l'll be stuck
in this apartment building forever.

215
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:13,777
The dream is dead.

216
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:16,612
-You're giving up that easy?
-l usually do.

217
00:11:17,979 --> 00:11:19,458
-See you.
-Wait a minute, Newman.

218
00:11:19,619 --> 00:11:21,177
You can't let this dream die.

219
00:11:21,339 --> 00:11:23,569
You moving away is my dream too.

220
00:11:26,699 --> 00:11:28,655
-What are you proposing?
-Whatever it takes...

221
00:11:28,819 --> 00:11:31,014
...for as long as it takes,
wherever it takes me...

222
00:11:31,179 --> 00:11:33,454
...so long as it takes you
away from me.

223
00:11:33,619 --> 00:11:36,053
-An alliance?
-An alliance.

224
00:11:38,619 --> 00:11:40,655
Now get the hell out of here.

225
00:11:45,499 --> 00:11:48,616
Hawaii? That's why you're
helping Newman with the mail?

226
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:51,213
Elaine,
Newman is my sworn enemy...

227
00:11:51,379 --> 00:11:55,452
...and he lives down the hall
from my home. My home, Elaine.

228
00:11:55,619 --> 00:11:58,770
Where l sleep,
where l come to play with my toys.

229
00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:00,931
Well, anyway, get this...

230
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:02,333
...l spoke to Alan.

231
00:12:02,499 --> 00:12:04,729
You know, l told him
l didn't wanna see him anymore.

232
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:06,412
Called me big head.

233
00:12:06,579 --> 00:12:07,807
Big head?

234
00:12:07,979 --> 00:12:09,571
lt's almost a compliment.

235
00:12:10,619 --> 00:12:13,611
lt's one of the nicest things
anyone has ever said to me.

236
00:12:16,539 --> 00:12:18,291
-Hello? Hey, George.
-Hey.

237
00:12:18,459 --> 00:12:21,292
-Yeah, listen, l can't make it later.
-You can't make it?

238
00:12:21,459 --> 00:12:24,849
Yeah, the tenant association has
decided to hear my side of the story...

239
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:27,010
...so l gotta kind of get ready.
l'll see you.

240
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:28,532
All right.

241
00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:31,736
-ls he not gonna go?
-Doesn't look like it's gonna happen.

242
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:35,892
-All right, well, l'll see you.
-All right.

243
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:42,009
Kramer, aren't you taking
any medication for that?

244
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:44,295
Yeah. Yeah, l got some pills.

245
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:45,812
They taste terrible.

246
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:49,857
-Just swallow them.
-Oh, my throat's too tender.

247
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,930
-All right, sit down.
-l don't want to.

248
00:12:52,099 --> 00:12:54,488
-Come on. Just sit down.
-No, Jerry. What--?

249
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:55,808
-Lay down.
-Why?

250
00:12:55,979 --> 00:12:57,890
-Sit down. Lean your head back.
-Hey!

251
00:12:58,059 --> 00:12:59,572
Open your mouth.
Open your mouth.

252
00:12:59,739 --> 00:13:02,207
Open it. Open it.

253
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:15,127
What kind of pills are these
anyway?

254
00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:16,698
'' For Smuckers''?

255
00:13:18,259 --> 00:13:21,695
'' May cause panting
and loss of fur''?

256
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,652
These are dog pills.

257
00:13:24,819 --> 00:13:26,252
We had the same symptoms.

258
00:13:26,419 --> 00:13:28,853
But he's a dog.
You need to see a real doctor.

259
00:13:29,019 --> 00:13:30,213
No. No doctors.

260
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:31,892
All right.

261
00:13:32,499 --> 00:13:33,648
Where are you going?

262
00:13:33,819 --> 00:13:36,049
l'm taking the car. l gotta run errands.
Wanna go?

263
00:13:36,219 --> 00:13:37,413
l don't know.

264
00:13:37,579 --> 00:13:39,729
Come on, you wanna go
for a ride, huh?

265
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:42,813
Come on. Come on. Yeah.

266
00:13:48,739 --> 00:13:50,695
Lady, could you move your head
a little bit?

267
00:13:50,859 --> 00:13:53,817
-What?
-Your head. l can't see out the back.

268
00:13:56,179 --> 00:13:58,010
Little more.

269
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:01,650
Little more.

270
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:06,771
Thank you.

271
00:14:09,619 --> 00:14:11,928
l don't see any tissues back here.

272
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:13,453
Wait a minute.

273
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:16,053
This isn't the way to the park.

274
00:14:16,219 --> 00:14:17,447
Where are we going?

275
00:14:17,979 --> 00:14:20,334
l recognize this block.

276
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:22,372
You're taking me to the doctor.

277
00:14:24,179 --> 00:14:26,409
So, Mom, Dad...

278
00:14:26,619 --> 00:14:28,416
...l was hoping
that you could help me...

279
00:14:28,579 --> 00:14:31,252
...to remember my childhood
a little more clearly.

280
00:14:31,419 --> 00:14:34,331
l feel a draft. Let's change tables.

281
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:36,057
Get out of here. We have a booth.

282
00:14:36,619 --> 00:14:38,530
Frank, l'm cold.

283
00:14:38,739 --> 00:14:40,377
Order a hot dish.

284
00:14:41,499 --> 00:14:43,410
Why can't we sit over there?

285
00:14:43,579 --> 00:14:46,935
-That's not a booth.
-Who says we have to sit in a booth?

286
00:14:47,099 --> 00:14:50,296
l didn't take the subway to New York
to sit at a table like that!

287
00:14:50,499 --> 00:14:53,491
Well, l didn't take a subway
to be in a drafty restaurant!

288
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,138
Mom--

289
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:58,052
Now, George, what do you
wanna know about your childhood?

290
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:01,612
Actually,
l think l'm pretty clear on it.

291
00:15:02,939 --> 00:15:05,248
Where's that breeze coming from?

292
00:15:05,659 --> 00:15:07,809
-Kramer, out of the car. Out now.
-No, Jerry.

293
00:15:07,979 --> 00:15:10,049
-All right. That's it. Come on.
-No. Jerry.

294
00:15:12,659 --> 00:15:15,127
Hey. Hey, get back over here.
Kramer.

295
00:15:15,299 --> 00:15:17,017
Get over here. You are bad.

296
00:15:17,179 --> 00:15:18,817
Bad neighbour.

297
00:15:18,979 --> 00:15:20,492
Kramer.

298
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:26,098
Just then a rescue ship emerged
from the fog and saved us.

299
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,612
lt was--

300
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:33,493
lt was the sweetest sight
my eyes ever saw.

301
00:15:34,379 --> 00:15:36,131
Thank you, Mr. Eldridge.

302
00:15:36,499 --> 00:15:39,730
The tenant board will now hear
Mr. Costanza's testimony.

303
00:15:46,619 --> 00:15:48,132
How'd it go? Get it all delivered?

304
00:15:48,539 --> 00:15:51,133
-What happened?
-Kramer bit me.

305
00:15:54,699 --> 00:15:56,576
-Bit you?
-We had an argument about me...

306
00:15:56,739 --> 00:16:00,015
...moving to Hawaii and he locked on
to my ankle like it was a soup bone.

307
00:16:01,539 --> 00:16:03,734
l'm hobbled.
l don't think l can do my route.

308
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:06,288
And they're awarding the transfer
in two days.

309
00:16:06,459 --> 00:16:08,370
-Well, what if l delivered it?
-You?

310
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:14,418
-You can't deliver mail.
-Why not?

311
00:16:16,219 --> 00:16:19,177
You're right. lt's just walking around
and putting it in the boxes.

312
00:16:19,339 --> 00:16:22,934
-Well, what am l gonna wear?
-My uniform from my rookie year.

313
00:16:23,099 --> 00:16:25,488
l can't believe
l'm gonna be a mailman.

314
00:16:28,979 --> 00:16:31,573
Here you go. Merry Christmas.

315
00:16:31,739 --> 00:16:32,933
Mail on Sunday?

316
00:16:46,659 --> 00:16:51,175
l was handcuffed to the bed
in my underwear...

317
00:16:51,339 --> 00:16:52,533
...where l remained for....

318
00:16:52,699 --> 00:16:54,929
She certainly seemed interested
in me.

319
00:16:55,099 --> 00:16:58,887
Though she was attractive,
she was also, in fact, a Nazi.

320
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:03,974
The water that l had been
swimming in was very cold...

321
00:17:04,379 --> 00:17:08,770
...and when l dropped the towel
there had been significant shrinkage.

322
00:17:09,499 --> 00:17:11,569
My parents were looking at me.

323
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,695
So there l was...

324
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:17,337
...with the marble rye hanging
from the end of a fishing pole.

325
00:17:17,499 --> 00:17:19,808
ln closing, these stories
have not been embellished...

326
00:17:19,979 --> 00:17:21,810
...because they need
no embellishment.

327
00:17:22,299 --> 00:17:25,450
They are simply, horrifyingly,
the story of my life...

328
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:29,692
...as a short, stocky,
slow-witted bald man.

329
00:17:30,219 --> 00:17:31,652
Thank you.

330
00:17:33,939 --> 00:17:35,611
Oh, also...

331
00:17:35,779 --> 00:17:39,613
...my fiancée died from licking
toxic envelopes that l picked out.

332
00:17:39,779 --> 00:17:41,451
Thanks again.

333
00:17:48,219 --> 00:17:51,017
Hey, l've been trying to jam stuff
in the box like you told me...

334
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:53,613
...but sometimes it says,
'' Photographs: Do not bend.''

335
00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:55,690
Do not bend.

336
00:17:56,859 --> 00:18:00,169
Just crease, crumple, cram.
You'll do fine.

337
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:04,898
Hello?

338
00:18:05,339 --> 00:18:06,852
This is he.

339
00:18:07,539 --> 00:18:09,370
l don't understand.

340
00:18:11,419 --> 00:18:12,693
Very well.

341
00:18:13,499 --> 00:18:14,488
What?

342
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:17,492
That was the vice president
of the post office.

343
00:18:19,019 --> 00:18:20,850
l didn't get the transfer.

344
00:18:21,019 --> 00:18:23,579
They knew it wasn't me
doing my route.

345
00:18:23,739 --> 00:18:24,888
How did they know?

346
00:18:25,059 --> 00:18:27,619
Too many people got their mail.

347
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:29,371
Close to 80 percent.

348
00:18:29,539 --> 00:18:32,770
Nobody from the post office has ever
cracked the 50-percent barrier.

349
00:18:32,939 --> 00:18:34,577
lt's like the three-minute mile.

350
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:37,731
-l tried my best.
-Exactly.

351
00:18:37,899 --> 00:18:40,288
You're a disgrace to the uniform.

352
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,251
You know, this is your coat.

353
00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:49,097
Damn.

354
00:18:56,499 --> 00:18:58,615
He flew right into your head...

355
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:00,337
...like he couldn't avoid it.

356
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:02,338
Really?

357
00:19:02,499 --> 00:19:04,455
Never seen that before...

358
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:06,814
...bird into a woman's head.

359
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:15,134
There's no contest.
The guy had nothing.

360
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:19,292
The ship went down,
he got into a lifeboat. Come on.

361
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:21,609
Boy, he didn't know
what he was up against.

362
00:19:22,259 --> 00:19:24,090
So when do you move
into the apartment?

363
00:19:24,259 --> 00:19:26,773
They're making their decision today.

364
00:19:28,899 --> 00:19:30,969
-What's the matter with you?
-Nothing...

365
00:19:31,139 --> 00:19:35,530
...except that a bird
ran into my giant freak head.

366
00:19:37,859 --> 00:19:39,133
What giant freak head?

367
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:43,770
The one that sits atop
my disproportionately puny body.

368
00:19:44,779 --> 00:19:47,452
l'm a walking candy apple.

369
00:19:50,019 --> 00:19:52,055
So it's actually gotten to you?

370
00:19:52,219 --> 00:19:54,779
You're playing right into his hands.

371
00:19:54,939 --> 00:19:57,897
What? Yeah, you're right.

372
00:19:58,499 --> 00:20:01,775
All l have to do is call him up
and sit down with him...

373
00:20:01,939 --> 00:20:03,850
...and show him
that it doesn't bother me.

374
00:20:04,019 --> 00:20:05,611
You know, laugh it off.

375
00:20:05,779 --> 00:20:07,497
Or jam a fork into his forehead.

376
00:20:08,299 --> 00:20:09,937
-Either way.
-All right.

377
00:20:13,099 --> 00:20:15,454
-l want to apologize for--
-Oh, please.

378
00:20:15,619 --> 00:20:18,338
-And l hope we can get past all this.
-Past? We're way past.

379
00:20:18,499 --> 00:20:20,854
-So you have a big head.
-So what?

380
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:23,374
Goes well with the bump
in your nose.

381
00:20:24,459 --> 00:20:25,528
What?

382
00:20:27,379 --> 00:20:31,338
Please, get help. There's a crazy,
bigheaded woman beating some guy.

383
00:20:31,499 --> 00:20:34,775
Tell the police
it's the Old Mill Restaurant. Hurry.

384
00:20:44,499 --> 00:20:46,490
That's some cough you got.

385
00:20:46,659 --> 00:20:48,297
He's trying
to tell us something.

386
00:20:48,459 --> 00:20:50,529
-What is it? Trouble?
-Trouble.

387
00:20:50,699 --> 00:20:52,212
Trouble where? Where's trouble?

388
00:20:52,379 --> 00:20:54,370
Old Mill.

389
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:56,575
Trouble at the Old Mill?
Oh, my God.

390
00:20:56,739 --> 00:20:58,855
Good boy. Good boy.
Lead the way. Come on.

391
00:21:09,819 --> 00:21:12,253
Excuse me,
what are you doing in there?

392
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:15,138
l'm moving in.
Alan Mercer, new neighbour.

393
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:17,130
But, what--?
Elaine's '' big head'' guy?

394
00:21:17,899 --> 00:21:20,049
-They gave you the apartment?
-Yeah.

395
00:21:20,219 --> 00:21:22,335
Why? Because you were stabbed...

396
00:21:22,539 --> 00:21:24,416
...and got coffee thrown
in your face and--

397
00:21:24,579 --> 00:21:26,649
Oh, fork in the forehead.

398
00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:28,931
That's why
they gave you the apartment?

399
00:21:29,099 --> 00:21:31,567
No. Just gave the super 50 bucks.

400
00:21:32,259 --> 00:21:33,772
Wait a minute.
That is my apartment.

401
00:21:33,939 --> 00:21:36,453
l earned it with 34 years of misery.

402
00:21:36,619 --> 00:21:37,813
Tough luck, chinless.
