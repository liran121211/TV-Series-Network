1
00:00:06,276 --> 00:00:08,915
You know, l can now bite
my fingernails so evenly...

2
00:00:09,076 --> 00:00:11,032
...l don't even need
to use a clipper anymore.

3
00:00:11,196 --> 00:00:12,754
But it's a pleasure to use clippers.

4
00:00:12,916 --> 00:00:16,033
Why gnaw away like a mental patient
when we have this elegant device?

5
00:00:19,516 --> 00:00:20,835
What if you're in prison?

6
00:00:20,996 --> 00:00:23,635
-You don't think they give clippers?
-No, it's like a weapon.

7
00:00:23,796 --> 00:00:25,991
You know what's really a weapon,
that big toenail.

8
00:00:26,156 --> 00:00:29,671
You let that grow for a month,
take it in the shower, it's like a shiv.

9
00:00:31,356 --> 00:00:32,630
l love prison.

10
00:00:32,796 --> 00:00:34,787
lt is fascinating.

11
00:00:35,116 --> 00:00:38,188
Yeah, maybe someday.

12
00:00:43,876 --> 00:00:46,595
You want me to find
a poem about Susan?

13
00:00:46,756 --> 00:00:48,712
May she rest in peace.

14
00:00:49,236 --> 00:00:53,149
Well, we think it would be a nice touch
for the foundation literature.

15
00:00:53,356 --> 00:00:55,824
You have a favourite poet, George?

16
00:00:56,916 --> 00:01:00,192
l like Flavman.

17
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,950
-Pardon?
-Flavman.

18
00:01:04,996 --> 00:01:07,590
Well, you should choose the poem
since you knew Susan best...

19
00:01:07,756 --> 00:01:11,431
...at the time
of her unfortunate...accident.

20
00:01:15,556 --> 00:01:17,547
-He cleared his throat?
-Yes.

21
00:01:17,716 --> 00:01:18,910
So?

22
00:01:19,076 --> 00:01:22,352
He did it right as he said,
'' Her unfortunate accident.''

23
00:01:22,516 --> 00:01:23,665
Not getting it.

24
00:01:23,836 --> 00:01:26,509
Jerry, a throat clear is a non-verbal
implication of doubt.

25
00:01:26,676 --> 00:01:28,029
He thinks l killed Susan.

26
00:01:28,196 --> 00:01:30,835
Oh, help me, Rhonda.

27
00:01:32,436 --> 00:01:34,427
-What time is it?
-One-fifteen.

28
00:01:34,596 --> 00:01:36,029
Right now?

29
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:38,588
l gotta go meet Pam.

30
00:01:38,756 --> 00:01:40,508
Oh, the bookstore girl.
How's that going?

31
00:01:40,676 --> 00:01:43,236
Okay. l'm just not gaga over her.

32
00:01:43,396 --> 00:01:44,829
For once, l'd like to be gaga.

33
00:01:44,996 --> 00:01:46,190
Where's Elaine?

34
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:47,948
She's having Carol,
Gail and Lisa over.

35
00:01:48,116 --> 00:01:49,549
You know, they all have kids now.

36
00:01:49,716 --> 00:01:51,468
What's with all these people
having babies?

37
00:01:51,636 --> 00:01:53,945
-Perpetuation of the species.
-Yeah, right.

38
00:01:54,436 --> 00:01:56,904
-By the way, just for the record--
-No, l did not.

39
00:01:57,076 --> 00:01:58,509
All right.

40
00:01:59,556 --> 00:02:03,390
But because it comes out
of your baby, it smells good.

41
00:02:04,436 --> 00:02:07,234
Well, that's-- That's sweet.

42
00:02:07,396 --> 00:02:10,433
Being a mother
has made me feel so beautiful.

43
00:02:11,156 --> 00:02:14,944
Elaine, you gotta have a baby.

44
00:02:15,116 --> 00:02:17,107
Oh, hey, you know...

45
00:02:17,276 --> 00:02:18,675
...l had a piece of whitefish...

46
00:02:18,836 --> 00:02:21,396
...over at Barney Greengrass
the other day and l--

47
00:02:21,756 --> 00:02:25,066
Elaine, move to Long lsland
and have a baby already.

48
00:02:25,236 --> 00:02:28,228
-l really like the city.
-The city's a toilet.

49
00:02:28,396 --> 00:02:30,432
When's the last time
you saw my little Adam?

50
00:02:30,596 --> 00:02:32,268
lt was in the Hamptons.

51
00:02:32,436 --> 00:02:34,825
-Oh, l have pictures.
-No, no, that's okay. lt's--

52
00:02:34,996 --> 00:02:38,466
Look at him, just look at him.

53
00:02:40,156 --> 00:02:42,989
Elaine was telling me about
this whitefish she had the other day.

54
00:02:43,156 --> 00:02:45,351
Do you really think l'm wrong
about this Wyck guy?

55
00:02:45,516 --> 00:02:46,995
lf you really wanna test him out...

56
00:02:47,156 --> 00:02:48,987
...why don't you try
the Jerry Lewis trick?

57
00:02:49,156 --> 00:02:51,465
-Jerry Lewis?
-l heard when Jerry left a meeting...

58
00:02:51,636 --> 00:02:54,355
...he'd purposely leave a briefcase
with a tape recorder in it.

59
00:02:54,516 --> 00:02:57,826
After five minutes, he'd come back,
listen to what everyone said.

60
00:02:57,996 --> 00:02:59,509
-That's pretty paranoid.
-Yes, it is.

61
00:02:59,676 --> 00:03:01,985
-l like it.
-l thought you might.

62
00:03:04,076 --> 00:03:06,032
Hi, l'm Pam.

63
00:03:06,196 --> 00:03:07,390
You must be Kramer.

64
00:03:08,996 --> 00:03:12,033
Jerry has told me a lot about you.

65
00:03:13,316 --> 00:03:16,672
Well, l'm supposed to meet Jerry.
lt's my day off.

66
00:03:17,076 --> 00:03:18,429
l work in a bookstore.

67
00:03:18,876 --> 00:03:20,673
Books.

68
00:03:22,196 --> 00:03:23,788
Careful.

69
00:03:26,236 --> 00:03:27,430
-Hi. Sorry l'm late.
-Hi.

70
00:03:27,596 --> 00:03:28,949
That's okay. Kramer let me in.

71
00:03:29,116 --> 00:03:30,913
lf we rush,
we can still make the movie.

72
00:03:31,076 --> 00:03:33,226
lt was really nice meeting you.

73
00:03:40,436 --> 00:03:41,630
l'm in trouble, buddy.

74
00:03:41,796 --> 00:03:43,070
l just met a woman.

75
00:03:43,236 --> 00:03:44,828
-Go on.
-Well...

76
00:03:45,996 --> 00:03:47,634
...she's Jerry's girlfriend.

77
00:03:47,796 --> 00:03:50,026
Yes, forbidden love.

78
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:51,948
She works in a bookshop.

79
00:03:52,116 --> 00:03:54,584
-Her name is Pam.
-Pam.

80
00:03:54,756 --> 00:03:57,953
l don't know the woman,
but she sounds quite fetching.

81
00:03:58,116 --> 00:04:00,391
l can't even speak in front of her.

82
00:04:00,556 --> 00:04:01,625
Jerry.

83
00:04:01,796 --> 00:04:04,629
What could she possibly see
in Jerry?

84
00:04:06,516 --> 00:04:08,188
She has delicate beauty.

85
00:04:08,356 --> 00:04:11,154
Jerry wouldn't know delicate
if it bludgeoned him over the head.

86
00:04:11,316 --> 00:04:14,035
And yet, he's my friend.

87
00:04:14,196 --> 00:04:16,187
And therein lies the tragedy.

88
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:19,268
For l believe, sadly for you...

89
00:04:19,436 --> 00:04:22,508
...that there is but one woman
meant for each of us.

90
00:04:22,676 --> 00:04:25,952
One perfect angel
for whom we are put on this earth.

91
00:04:26,116 --> 00:04:27,469
Oh, that's beautiful, Newman.

92
00:04:27,636 --> 00:04:29,433
One winsome tulip...

93
00:04:29,596 --> 00:04:34,351
...we ceaselessly yearn for throughout
our dreary workaday lives...

94
00:04:34,516 --> 00:04:38,350
...and you, my friend,
have found your angel.

95
00:04:38,516 --> 00:04:40,074
l can tell...

96
00:04:40,236 --> 00:04:43,865
...for my heart has also been captured
by a breathless beauty...

97
00:04:44,036 --> 00:04:46,470
...whom l fear l will never possess.

98
00:04:46,636 --> 00:04:48,433
l thought we were talking about me.

99
00:04:48,596 --> 00:04:50,427
Oh, right.

100
00:04:50,596 --> 00:04:52,712
Kramer, you have to confront Jerry.

101
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:54,434
-Confront Jerry? l can't.
-You must.

102
00:04:54,596 --> 00:04:56,712
-l won't.
-You will.

103
00:04:56,876 --> 00:05:00,835
'' Elaine, you gotta have a baby.''

104
00:05:01,636 --> 00:05:03,149
Where are the poetry magazines?

105
00:05:03,316 --> 00:05:04,829
The New York er has poetry.

106
00:05:04,996 --> 00:05:07,146
Yes, The New York er.

107
00:05:07,316 --> 00:05:09,955
Why do you invite these women over
if they annoy you so much?

108
00:05:10,116 --> 00:05:11,310
Well, they're my friends...

109
00:05:11,476 --> 00:05:14,593
...but they act as if having a baby
takes some kind of talent.

110
00:05:14,756 --> 00:05:16,394
Come on. You wanna have a baby.

111
00:05:16,556 --> 00:05:19,753
-Why? Because l can?
-lt's the life force.

112
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,634
l saw a show
on the mollusk last night.

113
00:05:21,796 --> 00:05:24,185
Elaine, the mollusk travels
from Alaska to Chile...

114
00:05:24,356 --> 00:05:26,028
...just for a shot at another mollusk.

115
00:05:26,196 --> 00:05:27,390
You think you're any better?

116
00:05:27,556 --> 00:05:30,673
Yes, l think l am better
than the mollusk.

117
00:05:30,836 --> 00:05:33,396
Excuse me, l couldn't help
overhearing what you were saying.

118
00:05:33,556 --> 00:05:35,945
-Oh, l'm sorry--
-No, no, l think l agree with you.

119
00:05:36,116 --> 00:05:38,346
l mean, all this talk
about having babies.

120
00:05:38,516 --> 00:05:40,108
Yeah, like you must procreate.

121
00:05:40,276 --> 00:05:41,868
Besides, anyone can do it.

122
00:05:42,036 --> 00:05:44,072
Oh, it's been done to death.

123
00:05:46,036 --> 00:05:48,596
l should have a poem
very soon now.

124
00:05:48,756 --> 00:05:50,872
Are you okay, George?

125
00:05:51,036 --> 00:05:52,264
No, no.

126
00:05:53,076 --> 00:05:54,714
Not really.

127
00:05:55,956 --> 00:06:00,825
Ever since Susan passed on,
l have good days and bad.

128
00:06:01,716 --> 00:06:05,595
Some days l'm haunted
by one word:

129
00:06:05,756 --> 00:06:07,314
Why?

130
00:06:07,476 --> 00:06:09,307
Why Susan?

131
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:13,585
Why wasn't it me
licking those invitations?

132
00:06:14,156 --> 00:06:16,112
Why am l still here?

133
00:06:18,036 --> 00:06:19,674
But l gotta run.

134
00:06:26,996 --> 00:06:29,988
Now, the stock options
for this year look quite--

135
00:06:37,636 --> 00:06:39,308
Briefcase.

136
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:45,066
So, Kevin, if l don't want children...

137
00:06:45,236 --> 00:06:47,306
...does that make me
a bad humanitarian?

138
00:06:47,476 --> 00:06:49,546
-Not at all.
-Because when you get to know me...

139
00:06:49,716 --> 00:06:51,911
...you'll see that l'm
a pretty good humanitarian.

140
00:06:52,076 --> 00:06:54,795
You are doing a wonderful job,
by the way.

141
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,789
-Thanks a lot.
-Right? Am l right?

142
00:06:58,116 --> 00:07:02,906
Kramer, Kramer, come here,
look at my new friend Kevin.

143
00:07:04,236 --> 00:07:05,794
Oh, you got a little--

144
00:07:06,276 --> 00:07:07,595
-You got--
-Oh, yeah.

145
00:07:07,756 --> 00:07:10,429
l just had two
double-fudge sundaes.

146
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,188
Oh, are you all right?

147
00:07:12,356 --> 00:07:13,948
Yeah, l'll be okay.

148
00:07:15,116 --> 00:07:18,347
You know, Jerry has one of those
every time he bombs on stage.

149
00:07:18,516 --> 00:07:20,666
l'm sure he'll be sharing
his next one with Pam.

150
00:07:20,836 --> 00:07:22,189
Oh, no, that won't last.

151
00:07:22,356 --> 00:07:24,267
-What do you mean?
-He's not gaga.

152
00:07:31,876 --> 00:07:33,389
Let me tell you. That Jerry Lewis...

153
00:07:33,556 --> 00:07:35,228
...you wonder how people
get to the top?

154
00:07:35,436 --> 00:07:37,631
lt's ideas like this. Brilliant.

155
00:07:38,676 --> 00:07:40,234
Look at this.
What the hell happened?

156
00:07:40,396 --> 00:07:45,311
The whole side is damaged here,
and the lock is broken.

157
00:07:45,476 --> 00:07:47,592
-How long did you leave it there?
-Five minutes.

158
00:07:47,876 --> 00:07:49,070
What the hell happened here?

159
00:07:49,236 --> 00:07:51,625
Play the tape.
Maybe we'll get a clue.

160
00:07:52,516 --> 00:07:54,632
l have to rewind it first.

161
00:08:11,796 --> 00:08:13,388
All right. All right.

162
00:08:13,556 --> 00:08:15,945
Did anyone notice
George's fingernails?

163
00:08:16,116 --> 00:08:20,428
Oh, my, yes, they look lik e
they were eaten away by weevils.

164
00:08:20,596 --> 00:08:23,554
It's kind of hot in here.
Open the window.

165
00:08:24,276 --> 00:08:25,868
Hey, what are you doing?

166
00:08:26,036 --> 00:08:28,311
Dear God!

167
00:08:31,476 --> 00:08:32,670
ls that it?

168
00:08:33,396 --> 00:08:35,785
-lt stopped dead.
-What do you make of it?

169
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,108
l don't know.

170
00:08:39,156 --> 00:08:41,306
Jerry, can we talk?

171
00:08:41,476 --> 00:08:42,670
Kind of busy here.

172
00:08:42,836 --> 00:08:45,873
-l'd like to talk to Jerry in private.
-Why can't l stay?

173
00:08:46,036 --> 00:08:47,628
Because it doesn't concern you.

174
00:08:47,796 --> 00:08:50,594
Well, if it doesn't concern me,
then l can stay.

175
00:08:59,716 --> 00:09:01,786
-So, what's on your mind?
-lt's Pam.

176
00:09:01,956 --> 00:09:04,106
-Pam? What about Pam?
-l love her, Jerry.

177
00:09:04,716 --> 00:09:06,513
-You what?
-l love her.

178
00:09:06,676 --> 00:09:09,873
-ls that right?
-Oh, she's-- She's real.

179
00:09:10,036 --> 00:09:13,346
She can bring home the bacon
and fry it in the pan.

180
00:09:13,876 --> 00:09:17,073
-What does that mean?
-Oh, and that voice.

181
00:09:17,236 --> 00:09:20,592
-What about her name?
-Pam? Oh, it's a beautiful name.

182
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:22,994
Pam.

183
00:09:23,476 --> 00:09:25,148
Pam?

184
00:09:25,676 --> 00:09:27,268
Pam!

185
00:09:27,996 --> 00:09:30,226
-She's got really nice hair.
-Oh, it's incredible.

186
00:09:30,396 --> 00:09:32,307
Although, l might replace
her tortoise clip...

187
00:09:32,476 --> 00:09:35,070
...with one of those velvet scrunchies.
l love those.

188
00:09:35,356 --> 00:09:36,869
You've got really specific tastes.

189
00:09:37,036 --> 00:09:38,355
Oh, l know what l want, Jerry.

190
00:09:38,836 --> 00:09:40,110
She got nice calves.

191
00:09:40,276 --> 00:09:43,746
Oh, she's a dreamboat,
but you don't like her.

192
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,872
Maybe l could.
You're making some good points.

193
00:09:46,036 --> 00:09:47,833
-No, you can't, Jerry.
-But l might.

194
00:09:47,996 --> 00:09:49,429
-Oh, no, you don't.
-Why not?

195
00:09:49,596 --> 00:09:51,348
-The voice, the calves, the bacon.
-What?

196
00:09:51,516 --> 00:09:54,189
l think l can.
l even like the name Pam.

197
00:09:54,356 --> 00:09:55,550
Pam. Pam.

198
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:08,908
So now he wants her
more than ever.

199
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:10,350
Blast.

200
00:10:11,476 --> 00:10:12,750
What am l gonna do, huh?

201
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:15,191
Don't despair, my friend.

202
00:10:17,716 --> 00:10:21,789
l won't allow your love
to go unrequited, not like mine.

203
00:10:21,956 --> 00:10:23,309
What, again with you?

204
00:10:23,476 --> 00:10:24,625
Sorry.

205
00:10:24,796 --> 00:10:27,594
But love is a spice
with many tastes...

206
00:10:27,756 --> 00:10:32,432
...a dizzying array of textures
and moments.

207
00:10:33,396 --> 00:10:35,546
lf only l could say things like that
around her.

208
00:10:35,716 --> 00:10:37,786
Yes.

209
00:10:39,076 --> 00:10:40,987
Well, l hear three distinct sounds:

210
00:10:41,156 --> 00:10:42,908
A low rumple...

211
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:45,544
...followed by a metallic squink--

212
00:10:45,716 --> 00:10:47,468
Yes, yes, l heard the squink.

213
00:10:47,636 --> 00:10:51,390
--followed by a mysterious galonk.

214
00:10:51,956 --> 00:10:54,106
lt's a real baffler, isn't it?

215
00:10:54,276 --> 00:10:56,710
Well, one question
does come to mind.

216
00:10:58,276 --> 00:11:03,634
Have you considered just asking them
what happened to the briefcase?

217
00:11:04,516 --> 00:11:05,710
They would never tell me.

218
00:11:06,236 --> 00:11:08,955
First of all, they probably think
that l killed Susan.

219
00:11:09,116 --> 00:11:11,471
Besides, l don't even think
they like me.

220
00:11:11,636 --> 00:11:13,945
That Pam. l am gaga over her.

221
00:11:14,116 --> 00:11:15,469
''Gaga''? When did that happen?

222
00:11:15,636 --> 00:11:17,866
Yesterday, 6-ish.

223
00:11:19,156 --> 00:11:22,193
Well, maybe we should double.
l'm pretty gaga myself.

224
00:11:22,356 --> 00:11:23,948
You just met the guy yesterday.

225
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:25,629
Yeah, but we have a common goal.

226
00:11:25,796 --> 00:11:28,913
A barren, sterile existence
that ends when you die?

227
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:31,794
Yeah.

228
00:11:32,556 --> 00:11:34,512
You believe this guy
doesn't wanna have kids?

229
00:11:34,676 --> 00:11:37,236
-Yeah, of course.
-A guy will say anything to a woman.

230
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:39,148
Oh, please, he wouldn't say that.

231
00:11:39,316 --> 00:11:42,353
Elaine, l once told a woman
that l coined the phrase:

232
00:11:42,516 --> 00:11:43,790
'' Pardon my French.''

233
00:11:46,116 --> 00:11:49,870
l once told a woman l don't eat cake
because it goes right to my thighs.

234
00:11:51,476 --> 00:11:54,832
Once told a woman
l enjoy spending time with my family.

235
00:11:58,076 --> 00:12:01,591
Your looks and my words
will have built the perfect beast.

236
00:12:01,756 --> 00:12:03,235
All right.

237
00:12:11,196 --> 00:12:14,506
-Oh, hi, Kramer.
-Hi, how are you?

238
00:12:14,676 --> 00:12:16,553
Hi, how are you?

239
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,306
-l'm great.
-l too am well.

240
00:12:19,476 --> 00:12:21,148
l too am well.

241
00:12:22,436 --> 00:12:25,075
-Do l smell Pantene?
-Do l smell--?

242
00:12:25,876 --> 00:12:27,309
-Pantene!
-Pantene?

243
00:12:28,556 --> 00:12:30,194
Oh, my shampoo.

244
00:12:30,356 --> 00:12:31,869
Yeah, yeah, you know,
it is Pantene.

245
00:12:32,036 --> 00:12:34,345
l got a free sample of it
in with my junk mail.

246
00:12:34,516 --> 00:12:36,108
There really is no junk mail.

247
00:12:36,276 --> 00:12:38,153
Everybody wants a check
or birthday card--

248
00:12:38,316 --> 00:12:41,547
lt requires just as much manpower
to deliver as their precious cards--

249
00:12:41,716 --> 00:12:43,786
Newman.

250
00:12:43,956 --> 00:12:45,514
What?

251
00:12:46,476 --> 00:12:47,625
Human. Human.

252
00:12:47,796 --> 00:12:52,028
lt's human to be moved
by a fragrance.

253
00:12:52,196 --> 00:12:53,390
That's so true.

254
00:12:53,556 --> 00:12:56,707
Her bouquet cleaved his hardened--

255
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:58,912
-Shell.
-Shell

256
00:12:59,076 --> 00:13:02,273
And fondled his muscled heart

257
00:13:03,156 --> 00:13:05,875
He imbibed her glistening spell

258
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:09,870
Just before the other shoe fell

259
00:13:10,436 --> 00:13:12,427
Kramer, that is so lovely.

260
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:16,585
lt's by an unknown
20th century poet.

261
00:13:16,756 --> 00:13:19,634
-Oh, what's him name?
-Newman.

262
00:13:22,356 --> 00:13:25,029
Elaine, you changed my life.

263
00:13:25,196 --> 00:13:29,553
Oh, Kevin, you can go on and on
about how you don't want kids...

264
00:13:29,716 --> 00:13:31,991
...and it sounds--
lt sounds really nice...

265
00:13:32,156 --> 00:13:36,388
...but the truth is, l don't know
if you mean it or not.

266
00:13:36,556 --> 00:13:38,512
l got a vasectomy this morning.

267
00:13:40,156 --> 00:13:43,068
Although, l have a hunch
you mean it.

268
00:13:45,356 --> 00:13:46,675
l just came by to tell you...

269
00:13:46,836 --> 00:13:51,785
...l'm really, really happy
about this relationship. Really happy.

270
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:55,915
Oh, well, that's nice.

271
00:13:59,876 --> 00:14:01,628
A velvet scrunchie.

272
00:14:03,956 --> 00:14:05,389
Kramer.

273
00:14:11,316 --> 00:14:12,669
Hello, Newman.

274
00:14:12,996 --> 00:14:14,475
Hello, Jerry.

275
00:14:14,636 --> 00:14:15,785
How's Pam?

276
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:18,106
Pam? What do you care?

277
00:14:21,716 --> 00:14:23,229
Well, ta-ta.

278
00:14:24,316 --> 00:14:26,307
Wait a minute.

279
00:14:53,236 --> 00:14:54,828
All right, Newman, this is it.

280
00:14:54,996 --> 00:14:56,111
Steady, Jerry.

281
00:14:56,276 --> 00:14:58,790
Steady. Wouldn't wanna
lose your cool at a time like this.

282
00:14:58,956 --> 00:15:01,151
-Why not?
-Because right now...

283
00:15:01,316 --> 00:15:03,671
...l'm the only chance you've got.

284
00:15:07,436 --> 00:15:08,425
Come on.

285
00:15:11,156 --> 00:15:13,112
l can't believe l'm losing Pam.

286
00:15:13,276 --> 00:15:14,755
l know how you feel...

287
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:17,066
...for l too have a woman
for whom l pine.

288
00:15:17,236 --> 00:15:19,955
-l thought we were talking about me.
-Right.

289
00:15:20,116 --> 00:15:22,027
Anyway, l don't need your help.

290
00:15:22,196 --> 00:15:23,948
Oh, don't you, joke boy?

291
00:15:25,636 --> 00:15:28,434
You really think you can manipulate
that beautiful young woman...

292
00:15:28,596 --> 00:15:30,985
...like the half-soused,
nightclub rabble...

293
00:15:31,156 --> 00:15:34,432
...that lap up your inane
''observations''?

294
00:15:35,556 --> 00:15:36,784
All right, Newman.

295
00:15:36,956 --> 00:15:39,470
What do l to get you to stop
pulling strings for Kramer?

296
00:15:39,636 --> 00:15:42,434
Well, there is a little something
you can do for me.

297
00:15:42,596 --> 00:15:43,790
Come on, out with it.

298
00:15:43,956 --> 00:15:46,311
lt's about Elaine.

299
00:15:46,476 --> 00:15:47,955
Elaine? What does she have to--?

300
00:15:49,636 --> 00:15:52,104
Oh, no.

301
00:15:53,116 --> 00:15:55,346
You dated her.
Give me some inside information.

302
00:15:55,516 --> 00:15:57,029
Anything l can use.

303
00:15:57,396 --> 00:15:59,148
Well, l know she doesn't
wanna have kids.

304
00:16:02,316 --> 00:16:05,228
l thought you'd be
a little more enthusiastic about it.

305
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:09,834
l know. l don't want...kids.

306
00:16:09,996 --> 00:16:11,987
-What was that?
-Well...

307
00:16:12,156 --> 00:16:13,874
...Kevin, maybe l have a little doubt.

308
00:16:14,036 --> 00:16:15,947
l mean, nothing is 1 00 percent.

309
00:16:16,116 --> 00:16:17,868
This is.

310
00:16:18,516 --> 00:16:21,553
-Oh, boy, l always do this.
-What?

311
00:16:21,716 --> 00:16:24,947
l get all jazzed up about something,
and l go way too far with it.

312
00:16:25,116 --> 00:16:26,344
-Really?
-Oh, yeah.

313
00:16:26,516 --> 00:16:29,826
Like last summer, l'm watching TV
and l saw one of those jet skis.

314
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:33,476
Four thousand dollars later,
and it's sitting in my garage.

315
00:16:33,636 --> 00:16:36,753
You know, that's weird actually,
because l'm sort of the same way.

316
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:40,352
l mean, once for, like, no reason,
l flattened my hair...

317
00:16:40,516 --> 00:16:44,111
...and l had all these strands
hanging in my face all the time.

318
00:16:44,276 --> 00:16:48,189
Sometimes l think l do want kids,
maybe a lot of kids.

319
00:16:48,356 --> 00:16:51,154
Sometimes l think about
wearing my hair real short.

320
00:16:51,316 --> 00:16:55,309
Yeah, l think l like short hair,
really short.

321
00:16:55,476 --> 00:16:57,068
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

322
00:17:01,076 --> 00:17:05,069
This is a crude mock-up
of the conference room.

323
00:17:05,236 --> 00:17:06,635
One-fourteenth scale.

324
00:17:06,956 --> 00:17:08,275
When did you build this thing?

325
00:17:08,436 --> 00:17:10,552
Yesterday. Took the day off.

326
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:15,468
Now, from the time
that l left the room--

327
00:17:15,636 --> 00:17:17,706
-Wait. That's you?
-Yeah.

328
00:17:18,076 --> 00:17:19,748
l think the M&M should be you.

329
00:17:25,876 --> 00:17:27,628
All right, whatever.

330
00:17:28,276 --> 00:17:31,985
Now, whatever caused
the damage...

331
00:17:32,156 --> 00:17:36,274
...it was jarring enough
to completely stop the tape.

332
00:17:36,436 --> 00:17:39,075
-And?
-Okay.

333
00:17:39,236 --> 00:17:41,352
That's what we know.

334
00:17:41,996 --> 00:17:44,590
-But we already knew that.
-Well, yeah.

335
00:17:44,756 --> 00:17:47,634
Just give me some idea
what you think it could be.

336
00:17:47,996 --> 00:17:50,351
-l don't know if you're ready for it.
-Please.

337
00:17:50,956 --> 00:17:54,949
l believe that l'm about
to become the target...

338
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:58,233
...of a systematic process
of intimidation and manipulation...

339
00:17:58,396 --> 00:18:01,468
-...the likes of which--
-Hold it. You're right. l'm not ready.

340
00:18:04,436 --> 00:18:05,585
-Yeah?
-It's Pam.

341
00:18:05,756 --> 00:18:08,395
Come on up. All right, it's Pam.
You gotta get going.

342
00:18:08,556 --> 00:18:09,955
l'm not through here, Jerry.

343
00:18:10,116 --> 00:18:12,072
l'm gonna keep on investigating.

344
00:18:12,476 --> 00:18:13,795
This thing is like an onion.

345
00:18:13,956 --> 00:18:18,188
The more layers you peel,
the more it stinks.

346
00:18:22,716 --> 00:18:23,944
What was that?

347
00:18:24,116 --> 00:18:26,027
We were just playing.

348
00:18:27,636 --> 00:18:29,991
Listen, l had a long talk
with Kramer today.

349
00:18:30,996 --> 00:18:34,909
Well, the thing is l--
l think l have a little crush on him.

350
00:18:36,476 --> 00:18:37,670
l'm so happy.

351
00:18:37,836 --> 00:18:39,633
My world suddenly has meaning.

352
00:18:39,796 --> 00:18:41,707
This is the man
you have a crush on?

353
00:18:41,876 --> 00:18:43,787
Well, l have feelings for both of you.

354
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,787
You have feelings for him?
We're soul mates.

355
00:18:45,956 --> 00:18:47,548
Why can't l be a soul mate?

356
00:18:47,716 --> 00:18:51,311
Jerry, you really think Pam would want
you to be the father of her children?

357
00:18:51,476 --> 00:18:52,750
Children?

358
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:55,635
Who said anything about children?
l don't wanna have children.

359
00:18:59,196 --> 00:19:00,595
There are people in this room...

360
00:19:00,756 --> 00:19:05,511
...who would've been very happy
to never see this briefcase again.

361
00:19:06,276 --> 00:19:07,629
There are people in this room...

362
00:19:07,796 --> 00:19:10,264
...who think they can destroy
other people's property...

363
00:19:10,436 --> 00:19:12,108
...and get away with it.

364
00:19:12,596 --> 00:19:14,791
Well, let me tell you something
about those people.

365
00:19:14,956 --> 00:19:17,390
They weren't
counting on this brain...

366
00:19:18,196 --> 00:19:20,107
...and this tape recorder.

367
00:19:20,276 --> 00:19:21,709
-George--
-You'll have your turn.

368
00:19:24,436 --> 00:19:27,428
The truth must be heard.

369
00:19:27,596 --> 00:19:28,915
Hey, what are you doing?

370
00:19:29,316 --> 00:19:30,829
Dear God!

371
00:19:34,396 --> 00:19:35,875
That's all there was...

372
00:19:36,036 --> 00:19:39,631
...and yet it speaks volumes.

373
00:19:40,156 --> 00:19:42,033
A low rumple...

374
00:19:42,716 --> 00:19:44,911
...a metallic squink...

375
00:19:45,436 --> 00:19:47,313
...a galonk...

376
00:19:47,476 --> 00:19:50,832
...and someone crying out,
'' Dear God!''

377
00:19:52,636 --> 00:19:57,073
Let's start with-- With you, Wyck.

378
00:19:59,316 --> 00:20:02,513
George, Quinn here
was moving a chair.

379
00:20:02,676 --> 00:20:04,428
He lost his balance and dropped it.

380
00:20:04,596 --> 00:20:06,268
lt must have fallen
on your briefcase...

381
00:20:06,436 --> 00:20:09,826
...which, for some reason,
contained a running tape recorder.

382
00:20:17,036 --> 00:20:18,674
All right then.

383
00:20:19,556 --> 00:20:21,751
We've gotten to the bottom of that.

384
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:29,710
What are you guys doing here?

385
00:20:29,876 --> 00:20:31,468
We're getting vasectomies.

386
00:20:33,036 --> 00:20:35,425
-Why?
-l'm doing it for you.

387
00:20:36,356 --> 00:20:38,312
-What?
-What did you do to your hair?

388
00:20:38,836 --> 00:20:40,269
l cut it.

389
00:20:40,436 --> 00:20:41,630
lt's a little short.

390
00:20:41,796 --> 00:20:43,229
You think?

391
00:20:45,196 --> 00:20:46,265
What are you doing here?

392
00:20:46,436 --> 00:20:48,427
Kevin's having
his vasectomy reversed.

393
00:20:48,596 --> 00:20:49,824
-Reversed?
-Reversed?

394
00:21:08,796 --> 00:21:11,833
He imbibed her glistening spell

395
00:21:12,596 --> 00:21:16,271
Just before the other shoe fell

396
00:21:19,956 --> 00:21:21,230
ls that a Keats poem?

397
00:21:21,396 --> 00:21:22,829
No, it's a Newman.

398
00:21:25,436 --> 00:21:26,949
Well, l gotta run.

399
00:21:34,596 --> 00:21:37,064
Does anyone think George
might have murdered Susan?

400
00:21:37,476 --> 00:21:40,388
Oh, yeah, l just assumed
he murdered her.

401
00:21:40,556 --> 00:21:43,275
-Of course he killed her.
-So it's not just me then.

402
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:46,434
All right. Back to business.
