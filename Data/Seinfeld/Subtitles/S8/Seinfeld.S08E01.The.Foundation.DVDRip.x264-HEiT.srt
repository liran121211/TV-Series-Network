1
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:15,596
Well, it's a magnificent stone.

2
00:00:17,158 --> 00:00:19,353
They put it up this morning.

3
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:23,552
lt's just a magnificent stone.

4
00:00:24,478 --> 00:00:25,911
Jerry?

5
00:00:30,078 --> 00:00:31,591
George...

6
00:00:32,638 --> 00:00:34,390
...we'll leave you alone with her.

7
00:00:35,078 --> 00:00:36,557
-What?
-l'm sure there are things...

8
00:00:36,718 --> 00:00:37,912
...you'd like to say.

9
00:00:38,798 --> 00:00:40,470
No, l'm good.

10
00:00:41,118 --> 00:00:42,949
Really. Jerry?

11
00:00:43,118 --> 00:00:44,471
Jerry?

12
00:01:02,438 --> 00:01:04,076
Thank you, no.

13
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:08,073
And then right after
the All-Star break we...

14
00:01:08,238 --> 00:01:11,275
...we just swept the Orioles.

15
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,830
Four games.

16
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:16,355
ln Baltimore.

17
00:01:18,798 --> 00:01:20,311
So....

18
00:01:26,158 --> 00:01:27,386
Boy, that was awkward.

19
00:01:27,558 --> 00:01:28,786
l don't mind the cemetery.

20
00:01:29,558 --> 00:01:31,310
ln fact, now l see
why people like golf.

21
00:01:31,478 --> 00:01:34,151
lt's just nice to be outside
in a well-landscaped area.

22
00:01:34,838 --> 00:01:36,635
What were you saying
to the Rosses anyway?

23
00:01:36,798 --> 00:01:38,436
Oh, man, l don't know.

24
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:41,670
l told them, '' Her death takes place
in the shadow of new life.

25
00:01:41,838 --> 00:01:44,557
She's not really dead
if we find a way to remember her.''

26
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:46,754
-What is that?
-Star Trek II.

27
00:01:46,918 --> 00:01:48,237
Wrath of Khan.

28
00:01:48,398 --> 00:01:51,390
Right. Kramer and l
saw it last night.

29
00:01:51,558 --> 00:01:53,310
Spock dies.
They wrap him up in a towel...

30
00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:57,266
...and they shoot him out the bowels of
the ship in that big sunglasses case.

31
00:01:57,798 --> 00:02:00,392
lt was a hell of a thing
when Spock died.

32
00:02:01,198 --> 00:02:02,631
Yeah.

33
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:08,716
Well, anyway...

34
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,346
...the stone is up. Paid my respects.

35
00:02:12,278 --> 00:02:14,872
-l guess that's it, huh?
-So it's over?

36
00:02:15,038 --> 00:02:17,757
l have mourned for three long months,
summer months too.

37
00:02:17,918 --> 00:02:20,034
Anybody could grieve in January.

38
00:02:20,198 --> 00:02:22,792
lt's time for George
to start being George again.

39
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:24,710
All right. So let's do something later.

40
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:26,027
-How about a movie?
-Yes!

41
00:02:26,198 --> 00:02:28,234
Nothing says ''George'' like a movie.

42
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,751
-Movie?
-Yeah, you in?

43
00:02:29,918 --> 00:02:32,432
No, no, no, l can't.
l got my martial arts class.

44
00:02:32,598 --> 00:02:34,953
George is going to the movies.

45
00:02:35,518 --> 00:02:36,997
So how's your karate class going?

46
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:39,513
Karate, Jerry, karate.

47
00:02:39,678 --> 00:02:41,987
lt's the lifetime pursuit
of balance and harmony.

48
00:02:42,158 --> 00:02:43,750
But with punching and kicking.

49
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:45,512
Jerry.

50
00:02:45,678 --> 00:02:47,509
Karate is not here:

51
00:02:47,678 --> 00:02:48,872
lt's here:

52
00:02:49,038 --> 00:02:50,551
And here:

53
00:02:50,718 --> 00:02:52,515
And here:

54
00:02:52,678 --> 00:02:55,238
All right. l gotta go to the airport
and pick up Elaine.

55
00:02:55,398 --> 00:02:56,831
What, she's been away?

56
00:02:57,078 --> 00:02:59,717
She's been in Mexico for six weeks.

57
00:03:00,438 --> 00:03:03,748
l think you're wrong. We just went
to the fireworks the other day.

58
00:03:03,918 --> 00:03:05,909
That was July 4th.

59
00:03:10,238 --> 00:03:12,798
l'm out of here. When l get back
l don't wanna see you here:

60
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:16,348
Here or here:

61
00:03:18,238 --> 00:03:19,591
lt was unbelievable.

62
00:03:19,758 --> 00:03:23,990
Six weeks of travelling through Mexico
all on Peterman's peso.

63
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:26,069
Did you get any good ideas
for the catalogue?

64
00:03:26,238 --> 00:03:28,069
-Tons.
-Anything you couldn't have gotten...

65
00:03:28,238 --> 00:03:31,355
...tearing open a bag of Doritos
and watching Viva Zapata?

66
00:03:32,678 --> 00:03:34,589
You don't respect my work
at all, do you?

67
00:03:34,758 --> 00:03:36,794
-No, l don't.
-No.

68
00:03:37,278 --> 00:03:39,667
So, what's been going on
around this dump?

69
00:03:39,838 --> 00:03:41,271
How's your fiancée?

70
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:42,871
My what?

71
00:03:44,078 --> 00:03:47,115
Jeannie? Your fiancée?

72
00:03:47,798 --> 00:03:49,948
Oh, yeah. That.

73
00:03:50,118 --> 00:03:51,346
Well....

74
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:54,114
All right. Spill it, Jerome.

75
00:03:54,278 --> 00:03:55,870
There's really not that much to tell.

76
00:03:56,038 --> 00:03:57,994
About a month ago
we were here having lunch...

77
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:00,228
...and all of a sudden we both
just blurted out:

78
00:04:00,398 --> 00:04:02,434
-l hate you.
-l hate you.

79
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:05,234
-See you.
-See you.

80
00:04:06,278 --> 00:04:08,633
lt was unprecedented.
l mean, it was the first...

81
00:04:08,798 --> 00:04:11,266
...truly mutual breakup
in relationship history.

82
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:13,827
No rejection, no guilt, no remorse.

83
00:04:13,998 --> 00:04:15,351
You've never felt remorse.

84
00:04:15,518 --> 00:04:17,952
l know. l feel bad about that.

85
00:04:18,318 --> 00:04:19,876
l bet your parents were upset, huh?

86
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:23,267
-You haven't told them yet, have you?
-No.

87
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:28,148
So l pressed through the rushes.

88
00:04:28,318 --> 00:04:32,709
There below me, the shimmering
waters of Lake Victoria.

89
00:04:32,878 --> 00:04:35,346
Oh, for the love of God, man.

90
00:04:35,518 --> 00:04:38,112
Just tell me what the product is.

91
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,553
lt's a washcloth.

92
00:04:40,718 --> 00:04:43,516
No washcloths.

93
00:04:43,678 --> 00:04:45,669
Well, Mr. Peterman...

94
00:04:45,838 --> 00:04:48,306
...l've got a really good idea
for a hat.

95
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:53,268
Oh, my neck is one
gargantuan monkey fist.

96
00:04:53,478 --> 00:04:55,708
lt combines
the spirit of old Mexico...

97
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:58,312
...with a little big-city...

98
00:04:58,478 --> 00:04:59,672
...panache.

99
00:04:59,838 --> 00:05:02,591
l like to call it the '' urban sombrero.''

100
00:05:02,758 --> 00:05:04,874
No, no. No pears.

101
00:05:07,478 --> 00:05:10,197
-Mr. Peterman?
-No apples.

102
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:15,472
Where's my pineapple?

103
00:05:16,238 --> 00:05:17,717
Are you okay, Mr. Peterman?

104
00:05:17,878 --> 00:05:21,996
Yes, yes, go on. Go on. Go on.

105
00:05:22,158 --> 00:05:27,357
Well, see, it's businessmen
taking siestas.

106
00:05:27,518 --> 00:05:30,794
You know, it's the urban sombrero.

107
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:33,077
Mr. Peterman?

108
00:05:34,598 --> 00:05:37,510
l'm feeling something,
something l haven't felt for a long time.

109
00:05:37,678 --> 00:05:39,794
-Pride?
-No.

110
00:05:40,038 --> 00:05:42,757
Autonomy, complete
and total autonomy.

111
00:05:42,918 --> 00:05:44,510
Well, you're your own boss now.

112
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,555
-l wanna go to a tractor pull.
-Go ahead.

113
00:05:46,718 --> 00:05:49,278
-l am staying out all night.
-Who's stopping you?

114
00:05:49,438 --> 00:05:53,226
l wanna bite into a big hunk of cheese,
just bite into it like it's an apple.

115
00:05:53,398 --> 00:05:54,797
Whatever.

116
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:56,789
-Oh, God.
-What?

117
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,789
-lt's Dolores.
-Who?

118
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,869
Mulva.

119
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:03,598
-Jerry, hi.
-Hi, Dolores.

120
00:06:03,758 --> 00:06:05,191
George, you remember Dolores.

121
00:06:05,358 --> 00:06:06,916
-Dolores.
-Hi.

122
00:06:07,078 --> 00:06:08,477
l heard you got engaged.

123
00:06:08,638 --> 00:06:09,832
Yes, Dolores, l did.

124
00:06:09,998 --> 00:06:11,909
lt didn't work out, though, Dolores.

125
00:06:12,078 --> 00:06:13,352
Oh, that's too bad.

126
00:06:13,518 --> 00:06:16,828
You know, we should
get together some time.

127
00:06:16,998 --> 00:06:18,272
-See you.
-See you.

128
00:06:18,438 --> 00:06:20,394
Bye, Dolores.

129
00:06:21,158 --> 00:06:22,386
l thought Mulva hated you.

130
00:06:22,558 --> 00:06:24,071
Yeah, so did l.

131
00:06:24,238 --> 00:06:25,432
You know what?

132
00:06:25,598 --> 00:06:27,429
l bet it was the engagement.

133
00:06:27,598 --> 00:06:29,907
l've shown l can go all the way.

134
00:06:30,078 --> 00:06:31,909
-All the way?
-Not our all the way.

135
00:06:32,078 --> 00:06:33,227
Their all the way.

136
00:06:33,398 --> 00:06:35,195
l got the stink
of responsibility on me.

137
00:06:35,358 --> 00:06:36,632
You were engaged for a minute.

138
00:06:36,798 --> 00:06:40,029
-l was engaged for a year.
-You stink worse than l do.

139
00:06:40,198 --> 00:06:42,917
l'm feeling
something else here, Jerry.

140
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:46,115
Elaine, Mr. Peterman on line one.

141
00:06:46,278 --> 00:06:48,712
Hello, Mr. Peterman,
how are you feeling?

142
00:06:48,878 --> 00:06:52,314
Elaine, l'll be blunt.
l'm burnt out. l'm fried.

143
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:55,276
My mind is as barren
as the surface of the moon.

144
00:06:56,118 --> 00:06:58,313
l can run that catalogue no longer.

145
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:00,230
What? Who's gonna do it?

146
00:07:00,398 --> 00:07:02,389
-What about you?
-Me?

147
00:07:02,558 --> 00:07:05,277
-Why me?
-Why, indeed.

148
00:07:06,798 --> 00:07:08,550
Mr. Peterman, you can't leave.

149
00:07:08,718 --> 00:07:10,037
l've already left, Elaine.

150
00:07:10,198 --> 00:07:11,995
l'm in Burma.

151
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:16,474
-Burma?
-You most likely know it as Myanmar.

152
00:07:16,638 --> 00:07:19,596
But it will always be Burma to me.

153
00:07:19,758 --> 00:07:20,952
Bonne chance, Elaine.

154
00:07:21,118 --> 00:07:25,509
You there, on the motorbike,
sell me one of your melons.

155
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,232
Mr. Peterman?

156
00:07:27,398 --> 00:07:29,229
-Where?
-Burma.

157
00:07:29,398 --> 00:07:30,797
lsn't it Myanmar now?

158
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:33,153
Jerry, he wants me
to run the catalogue.

159
00:07:33,318 --> 00:07:35,274
l mean, it's crazy.
l can't be in charge.

160
00:07:35,438 --> 00:07:36,996
No, certainly not.

161
00:07:37,158 --> 00:07:39,626
-l can't give people orders.
-No one's gonna listen to you.

162
00:07:39,798 --> 00:07:42,153
l am not qualified
to run the catalogue.

163
00:07:42,318 --> 00:07:45,469
You're not qualified
to work at the catalogue.

164
00:07:46,398 --> 00:07:47,797
Hey.

165
00:07:48,358 --> 00:07:51,111
-What's wrong?
-Oh, Peterman ran off to Burma.

166
00:07:51,278 --> 00:07:53,075
And now he wants me
to run the catalogue.

167
00:07:53,238 --> 00:07:55,468
-Where?
-Myanmar.

168
00:07:55,638 --> 00:07:57,469
ls that the discount pharmacy?

169
00:07:58,758 --> 00:08:00,555
Well, l'm just going to tell him no.

170
00:08:00,718 --> 00:08:02,117
l can't run the catalogue.

171
00:08:02,278 --> 00:08:04,314
Whoa, ''can't''?

172
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:06,787
When did that word
enter your vocabulary?

173
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,471
What? ls the job too difficult?

174
00:08:09,398 --> 00:08:12,310
What? You don't have
enough experience?

175
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:14,673
You're not smart enough?

176
00:08:14,838 --> 00:08:17,398
Where's your confidence?

177
00:08:17,558 --> 00:08:20,231
Elaine, let me tell you a story.

178
00:08:20,398 --> 00:08:22,866
-When l first started karate....
-Karate?

179
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:25,188
Yeah, karate. l had no support.

180
00:08:25,358 --> 00:08:28,987
Not from him,
not from Newman, no one.

181
00:08:29,158 --> 00:08:32,355
First time l sparred
with an opponent l was terrified.

182
00:08:32,518 --> 00:08:35,237
My legs, they were like noodles.

183
00:08:35,398 --> 00:08:38,788
Then l looked inside,
and l found my katra.

184
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:42,315
-'' Katra''?
-Yeah, your spirit, your being.

185
00:08:42,478 --> 00:08:45,356
That part of you
that says, ''Yes, l can.''

186
00:08:45,518 --> 00:08:47,395
Sammy Davis had it.

187
00:08:49,078 --> 00:08:53,788
So l listened to my katra,
and now...l'm dominating the dojo.

188
00:08:54,798 --> 00:08:56,356
l'm class champion.

189
00:08:58,398 --> 00:09:01,435
Well, you know, l have watched
Peterman run the company.

190
00:09:01,598 --> 00:09:03,111
Sure, you have.

191
00:09:03,878 --> 00:09:05,152
l know how to do it.

192
00:09:05,318 --> 00:09:09,834
Pair of pants, stupid story,
a huge markup. l can do that.

193
00:09:09,998 --> 00:09:13,627
You follow your katra
and you can do anything.

194
00:09:13,798 --> 00:09:14,947
-Now get out of here.
-Okay.

195
00:09:17,518 --> 00:09:19,190
That kid is gonna be all right.

196
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:20,950
No, she's not.

197
00:09:21,518 --> 00:09:23,588
Come on, Kramer.

198
00:09:23,798 --> 00:09:25,834
-Hey there.
-Come on.

199
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:28,068
-Mom's down in the car.
-Okay, Joey.

200
00:09:28,238 --> 00:09:29,637
You have class at the same time?

201
00:09:29,798 --> 00:09:31,834
No, we're in the same class.

202
00:09:31,998 --> 00:09:33,317
You're in the same class?

203
00:09:33,478 --> 00:09:35,514
He almost beat me.

204
00:09:35,678 --> 00:09:37,748
Kramer, you're fighting children?

205
00:09:38,598 --> 00:09:41,510
We're all at the same
skill level, Jerry.

206
00:09:41,678 --> 00:09:43,191
He's 9 years old.

207
00:09:43,358 --> 00:09:45,952
You don't need karate.
You can just wring his neck.

208
00:09:47,358 --> 00:09:49,189
l got car pool.

209
00:09:50,638 --> 00:09:52,390
Thanks for the juice box, Mrs. Z.

210
00:09:53,358 --> 00:09:55,588
Hey, can we stop for ice cream
on the way home, Mom?

211
00:09:55,758 --> 00:09:57,032
-l don't know about--
-Please.

212
00:09:57,198 --> 00:10:00,793
-Please, please.
-Please. Please.

213
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,869
-All right.
-Yeah!

214
00:10:05,158 --> 00:10:06,557
You're taking the job?

215
00:10:06,718 --> 00:10:08,197
You got that straight.

216
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:11,031
Now, l want four new ideas
from each of you by 6:00.

217
00:10:11,198 --> 00:10:13,189
No, make that six ideas by 4:00.

218
00:10:13,358 --> 00:10:17,033
All right. Let's move.
Move! Move! Move!

219
00:10:20,638 --> 00:10:21,832
Are you prepared for kumite?

220
00:10:21,998 --> 00:10:23,192
-Yes, Sensei.
-Yes, Sensei.

221
00:10:23,358 --> 00:10:24,950
Fighting stance.

222
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,471
Begin.

223
00:10:44,598 --> 00:10:46,077
Winner.

224
00:10:50,758 --> 00:10:52,237
lt's open.

225
00:10:55,598 --> 00:10:58,237
-Rosses.
-Hello, George.

226
00:10:58,678 --> 00:11:00,555
Come in. Come in.

227
00:11:00,718 --> 00:11:02,674
We tried to call,
but the line was busy.

228
00:11:02,838 --> 00:11:04,954
Oh, oh, yeah. Sure, sure.

229
00:11:05,118 --> 00:11:06,949
Sit down, please.

230
00:11:07,118 --> 00:11:08,790
Cheese there?

231
00:11:09,678 --> 00:11:12,238
We know the last three months
have been hard on you.

232
00:11:12,398 --> 00:11:15,231
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Very, very hard.

233
00:11:15,398 --> 00:11:17,753
And they've been hard on us too.

234
00:11:17,918 --> 00:11:20,955
lt's a terrible tragedy
when parents outlive their children.

235
00:11:21,118 --> 00:11:25,350
Yes, l agree. l hope my parents
go long before l do.

236
00:11:25,998 --> 00:11:28,910
That's why we decided
to create a foundation...

237
00:11:29,078 --> 00:11:31,228
...to preserve Susan's memory.

238
00:11:31,398 --> 00:11:33,593
Oh, that's wonderful.

239
00:11:33,758 --> 00:11:36,397
And, of course, we want you
to be an integral part.

240
00:11:36,558 --> 00:11:38,469
Yes, integ--

241
00:11:39,118 --> 00:11:41,313
How--? How integral?

242
00:11:41,478 --> 00:11:43,070
You'll be on the board of directors.

243
00:11:43,238 --> 00:11:46,310
Great. Great.

244
00:11:46,478 --> 00:11:50,357
Oh, oh, oh, gosh,
you know, it's just....

245
00:11:50,518 --> 00:11:51,917
My duties with the Yankees--

246
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:54,148
Oh, don't worry, George.

247
00:11:54,318 --> 00:11:57,355
The foundation will revolve
around your schedule.

248
00:11:57,518 --> 00:12:01,511
Evening, weekends,
whenever you have free time.

249
00:12:03,238 --> 00:12:05,593
l can't believe this is happening.

250
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:08,795
Well, it wouldn't have without
your friend Jerry's inspirational words.

251
00:12:09,678 --> 00:12:14,752
He said to us, ''She's not really
dead if her shadow is--''

252
00:12:15,678 --> 00:12:18,476
-What was it, dear?
-Something about a way, wasn't it?

253
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:20,913
And a light and a--

254
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,194
Who the hell knows.

255
00:12:24,798 --> 00:12:27,517
But what's important is that
your relationship with Susan...

256
00:12:27,678 --> 00:12:29,350
...doesn't have to end.

257
00:12:29,518 --> 00:12:32,078
So will you be sure
to thank Jerry for us?

258
00:12:32,238 --> 00:12:35,275
The second l see him.

259
00:12:44,398 --> 00:12:46,628
-Hey.
-Hey.

260
00:12:47,198 --> 00:12:48,392
How's your day? Good?

261
00:12:48,558 --> 00:12:51,516
Actually, yeah, l'm meeting Mulva
here in a few minutes.

262
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:53,512
So...

263
00:12:53,678 --> 00:12:54,713
... Wrath of Khan?

264
00:12:54,878 --> 00:12:57,028
Yeah, was that a beauty or what?

265
00:12:58,558 --> 00:13:02,471
What was that line again? Something
about finding your way in a shadow?

266
00:13:02,638 --> 00:13:07,268
No, no, no, it's, ''She's not really dead
if we find a way to remember her.''

267
00:13:07,438 --> 00:13:08,632
That's it.

268
00:13:08,798 --> 00:13:10,868
That's the line...

269
00:13:11,478 --> 00:13:14,470
...that destroyed my life.

270
00:13:17,198 --> 00:13:18,517
Problem?

271
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,710
The Rosses have started up
a foundation...

272
00:13:20,878 --> 00:13:22,914
...and l have to sit
on the board of directors.

273
00:13:23,078 --> 00:13:24,989
Hey, board of directors, look at you.

274
00:13:25,158 --> 00:13:28,116
Yeah, look at me.
l was free and clear.

275
00:13:28,278 --> 00:13:30,473
l was living the dream.
Stripped to the waist...

276
00:13:30,638 --> 00:13:33,675
...eating a block of cheese
the size of a car battery.

277
00:13:33,838 --> 00:13:37,035
Before we go any further, l'd just like
to point out how disturbing it is...

278
00:13:37,198 --> 00:13:39,268
...that you equate
eating a block of cheese...

279
00:13:39,438 --> 00:13:41,872
...with some sort
of bachelor paradise.

280
00:13:42,318 --> 00:13:44,548
Don't you see? l'm back in.

281
00:13:44,718 --> 00:13:46,868
-All because of Wrath of Khan?
-Yes.

282
00:13:47,038 --> 00:13:49,268
Well, it was the best
of those movies.

283
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:55,829
Khan!

284
00:14:01,158 --> 00:14:02,637
George?

285
00:14:04,798 --> 00:14:06,277
George?

286
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:08,390
l'm Wyck Thayer, chairman of...

287
00:14:08,558 --> 00:14:10,514
-...the Susan Ross Foundation.
-Wink?

288
00:14:10,678 --> 00:14:12,589
-Wyck.
-Wyck.

289
00:14:13,318 --> 00:14:16,230
Now, as you know, the Rosses
had considerable monies.

290
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:18,628
Well, l-- l know
they have some monies.

291
00:14:18,798 --> 00:14:21,870
They had more than some monies.
Many, many monies.

292
00:14:23,598 --> 00:14:26,635
And they planned to give
a sizable portion of their estate...

293
00:14:26,798 --> 00:14:29,028
...to you and Susan
after the wedding.

294
00:14:29,558 --> 00:14:32,072
So if Susan and l had--

295
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:35,753
l mean, if the envelopes hadn't....

296
00:14:35,918 --> 00:14:37,988
-Then we....
-Yes.

297
00:14:38,158 --> 00:14:40,388
-And now?
-Not.

298
00:14:40,758 --> 00:14:43,272
lt's all been endowed
to the foundation.

299
00:14:43,438 --> 00:14:46,316
-Even this townhouse.
-This townhouse?

300
00:14:46,478 --> 00:14:48,548
Yes, this would
have been your wedding gift.

301
00:14:48,718 --> 00:14:49,946
-And now?
-Not.

302
00:14:50,118 --> 00:14:51,346
Not.

303
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:54,149
Also endowed.

304
00:14:55,078 --> 00:14:58,787
George, l know how much
Susan meant to you.

305
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,277
This can't be easy.

306
00:15:00,438 --> 00:15:02,474
You know, it really can't.

307
00:15:04,198 --> 00:15:05,347
So who broke it off?

308
00:15:05,518 --> 00:15:07,076
That's the thing. lt was mutual.

309
00:15:07,238 --> 00:15:09,468
Oh, come on. Everybody knows
there's no such thing...

310
00:15:09,638 --> 00:15:11,071
...as a mutual breakup.

311
00:15:11,238 --> 00:15:13,194
-Tell me the truth.
-l am.

312
00:15:13,358 --> 00:15:14,791
lt was the world's first.

313
00:15:15,478 --> 00:15:17,275
You know, when
l heard you got engaged...

314
00:15:17,438 --> 00:15:21,272
...l thought maybe you'd matured,
but obviously there's no growth here.

315
00:15:21,438 --> 00:15:25,272
l can't argue with that, but the fact
remains l was completely....

316
00:15:26,198 --> 00:15:27,517
Mulva.

317
00:15:37,878 --> 00:15:40,790
-Hello.
-Please hold for Elaine Benes.

318
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:43,347
Oh, l don't believe this.

319
00:15:44,998 --> 00:15:46,590
-Jerry?
-Hey.

320
00:15:46,758 --> 00:15:50,387
Hey, guess who just finished
laying out her first issue...

321
00:15:50,558 --> 00:15:52,310
...of the J. Peterman Catalogue.

322
00:15:52,478 --> 00:15:53,911
-How does it look?
-lt's a peach.

323
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:57,275
-What's that?
-l say, it's a peach.

324
00:15:57,438 --> 00:16:00,236
Let me ask you something. When
l told you my breakup was mutual...

325
00:16:00,398 --> 00:16:02,116
-...did you believe me?
-No, no, no.

326
00:16:02,278 --> 00:16:05,509
lt's weak. No one's gonna buy it,
and you shouldn't be selling it.

327
00:16:05,678 --> 00:16:07,270
l gotta do some research here.

328
00:16:07,438 --> 00:16:10,555
Hey, hey. Me, talking?

329
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:12,953
You know...

330
00:16:13,118 --> 00:16:14,949
...between you and me...

331
00:16:15,118 --> 00:16:18,952
...l always thought Kramer
was a bit of a doofus.

332
00:16:19,118 --> 00:16:21,632
But he believed in me.

333
00:16:21,798 --> 00:16:22,947
You did not.

334
00:16:23,118 --> 00:16:26,315
So as l see it,
he's not the doofus...

335
00:16:26,478 --> 00:16:28,469
...you are the doofus.

336
00:16:28,638 --> 00:16:30,469
-Oh, l'm the doofus?
-Yes.

337
00:16:30,638 --> 00:16:34,108
You, Jerry, are the doofus.

338
00:16:34,278 --> 00:16:37,827
You know, it occurs to me
that Kramer is at karate right now.

339
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:41,031
Well, maybe l'll just go down there
and thank him in person.

340
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:43,189
Yeah, that's what l was thinking.

341
00:16:48,158 --> 00:16:49,671
Kramer?

342
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,071
-Elaine.
-What are you doing?

343
00:16:52,238 --> 00:16:54,627
Well, l'm-- l'm dominating.

344
00:16:55,758 --> 00:16:57,430
You never said
you're fighting children.

345
00:16:57,598 --> 00:17:00,510
Well, it's not the size
of the opponent, Elaine.

346
00:17:00,678 --> 00:17:02,873
lt's the ferocity.

347
00:17:03,598 --> 00:17:05,554
This is what you used
to build me up?

348
00:17:05,718 --> 00:17:08,232
This is where you got
all that stupid '' katra'' stuff?

349
00:17:08,398 --> 00:17:11,276
No, no, no, that's from Star Trek III.

350
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:15,751
-The Search for Spock.
-Search for Spock?

351
00:17:15,918 --> 00:17:18,716
Yeah, yeah, l know. Jerry will tell you
that the Wrath of Khan...

352
00:17:18,878 --> 00:17:22,268
-...is the better picture, but for me, l--
-You doofus.

353
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:29,707
Okay, question number eight:

354
00:17:29,878 --> 00:17:33,154
What if l told you my fiancée
left me for another man?

355
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:36,355
Does that make me more likable,
less likable, as likable?

356
00:17:36,518 --> 00:17:37,917
Let's start over here this time.

357
00:17:38,318 --> 00:17:39,751
More.

358
00:17:39,918 --> 00:17:41,510
Less.

359
00:17:41,678 --> 00:17:44,875
-Same.
-Are we about through here?

360
00:17:49,998 --> 00:17:52,558
l thought you said your mom
was meeting us in the alley.

361
00:17:52,718 --> 00:17:55,915
She had a little change of plans.

362
00:17:57,758 --> 00:17:59,430
What's going on?

363
00:17:59,598 --> 00:18:01,270
Hey, Timmy, Clara.

364
00:18:02,038 --> 00:18:04,393
That was some kind of workout
we had tonight, huh?

365
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:06,150
Now we finish it.

366
00:18:08,638 --> 00:18:09,991
Get him.

367
00:18:10,158 --> 00:18:11,910
Mama!

368
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:16,868
l wouldn't eat anything
you caught in that pond...

369
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:19,029
...out in front of the condo.

370
00:18:20,118 --> 00:18:22,507
All right. Look, Elaine's here.
l gotta get going.

371
00:18:22,678 --> 00:18:26,637
By the way, l'm not getting married.
Tell Mom. Bye.

372
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:32,071
So....

373
00:18:34,118 --> 00:18:37,110
-Did you stop by the dojo?
-Yup.

374
00:18:37,278 --> 00:18:39,348
-How's your confidence level?
-Shot.

375
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:41,429
-Self-esteem?
-Gone.

376
00:18:41,598 --> 00:18:43,828
Doofus?

377
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:46,628
All right. So what?

378
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:48,993
You put out the catalogue.
How bad could it be?

379
00:18:55,798 --> 00:18:57,197
What is that?

380
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:00,347
The urban sombrero.

381
00:19:00,878 --> 00:19:02,391
l put it on the cover.

382
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:06,314
Well, nobody sees the cover.

383
00:19:08,158 --> 00:19:09,750
What happened to you?

384
00:19:09,918 --> 00:19:11,476
l got whupped.

385
00:19:11,998 --> 00:19:14,307
You should have seen
the rage in their little eyes.

386
00:19:14,478 --> 00:19:18,073
And those tiny little fists of fury.

387
00:19:20,638 --> 00:19:21,832
What is that?

388
00:19:22,598 --> 00:19:24,873
lt's the new cover
of the J. Peterman catalogue.

389
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,710
lt is Elaine's choice.

390
00:19:26,878 --> 00:19:28,072
Let's congratulate her.

391
00:19:30,278 --> 00:19:32,155
This is all your fault.

392
00:19:32,318 --> 00:19:34,229
You told me
l could run the company.

393
00:19:34,398 --> 00:19:37,356
Well, then l was way off.

394
00:19:37,838 --> 00:19:39,430
Well, l'll see you.

395
00:19:43,718 --> 00:19:45,197
l gotta go lay down.

396
00:19:45,358 --> 00:19:46,871
Are you and George
going out later?

397
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:48,630
No, he's still stuck
at the foundation.

398
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:50,675
You ought to go down there
and help him out.

399
00:19:50,838 --> 00:19:52,237
He's a widower.

400
00:19:52,398 --> 00:19:55,595
Widower? Wait a second.

401
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:01,236
Okay, let's see. The beach house,
48 acres, Southampton.

402
00:20:01,398 --> 00:20:03,070
That should fetch a fair price.

403
00:20:03,638 --> 00:20:06,710
-Would l have had access to that?
-Of course. Would have been yours.

404
00:20:06,878 --> 00:20:08,311
And now?

405
00:20:08,478 --> 00:20:09,752
Not.

406
00:20:10,878 --> 00:20:12,391
Got it.

407
00:20:16,278 --> 00:20:17,836
-Hello.
-Hey, Georgie.

408
00:20:17,998 --> 00:20:19,795
l'm doing some research
at the coffee shop.

409
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:21,357
Your story's the one.

410
00:20:21,518 --> 00:20:23,110
-My story?
-Yeah, your widower story...

411
00:20:23,278 --> 00:20:24,791
...has tested through the roof.

412
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,914
When are you getting out of there?

413
00:20:29,198 --> 00:20:32,315
Excuse me, Wyck,
are we almost done here?

414
00:20:32,478 --> 00:20:35,595
No, no, not even close.

415
00:20:40,238 --> 00:20:41,432
l can't go.

416
00:20:41,598 --> 00:20:43,270
What do you mean, you can't go?

417
00:20:43,438 --> 00:20:46,635
There's two really cute girls sitting
at the counter eating grilled cheese.

418
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:48,072
Cheese, George.

419
00:20:48,238 --> 00:20:50,149
Cheese.

420
00:20:50,318 --> 00:20:53,435
Okay, next item,
Susan's doll collection.

421
00:20:53,598 --> 00:20:57,034
Estimated value, 2.6 million.

422
00:20:57,198 --> 00:21:00,156
What do you say
we go through this doll by doll.

423
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,437
lt was nothing unusual.

424
00:21:17,598 --> 00:21:19,714
Every afternoon
for the last 24 years...

425
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:22,551
...l'd shut the door to my office
and sneak a little shuteye.

426
00:21:22,718 --> 00:21:24,151
No one was the wiser.

427
00:21:24,318 --> 00:21:28,470
But then my wife
gets me this urban sombrero.

428
00:21:28,638 --> 00:21:31,471
The next thing l know,
my ass is out on the street.

429
00:21:31,638 --> 00:21:33,390
l tried one too.

430
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:36,550
l woke up and found
my walking papers tacked to the brim.

431
00:21:36,718 --> 00:21:38,788
Stupid J. Pendleton.

432
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:41,670
lt's '' Peterman.''

433
00:21:41,838 --> 00:21:44,068
lt's J. Peterman.

434
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:47,677
l never thought
a hat would destroy my life.
