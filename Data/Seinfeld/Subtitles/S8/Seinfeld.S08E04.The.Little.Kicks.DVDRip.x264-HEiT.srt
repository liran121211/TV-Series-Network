1
00:00:05,516 --> 00:00:07,586
-l wouldn't walk over there.
-Why not?

2
00:00:07,756 --> 00:00:10,145
Because it's the most dangerous part
of the sidewalk.

3
00:00:10,316 --> 00:00:11,829
A cab hops a curb:

4
00:00:11,996 --> 00:00:14,066
You've had your last egg sandwich.

5
00:00:14,236 --> 00:00:17,672
What about over there? You know,
air conditioners fall out all the time.

6
00:00:17,836 --> 00:00:21,590
l'd much rather get hit by an 80-pound
air conditioner than a two-ton cab.

7
00:00:21,756 --> 00:00:24,145
No, no, cab's coming up right here.

8
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:27,149
Plastic hips, prosthetic legs,
a monkey to answer the phone...

9
00:00:27,316 --> 00:00:28,510
...l'm back in business.

10
00:00:28,676 --> 00:00:32,988
l'd much rather take one in the head,
like l did in '79.

11
00:00:33,676 --> 00:00:35,985
You were living
in the Village then, right?

12
00:00:36,676 --> 00:00:38,826
l don't really remember.

13
00:00:46,596 --> 00:00:48,552
Toxic-waste green.

14
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:50,354
That is disgusting.

15
00:00:50,516 --> 00:00:53,872
You know, revulsion has now become
a valid form of attraction.

16
00:00:54,036 --> 00:00:56,266
Well, then, you're driving me wild.

17
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:59,111
l had them done for
the Peterman bash l'm throwing.

18
00:00:59,276 --> 00:01:00,504
Why are you having a party?

19
00:01:00,676 --> 00:01:03,793
Oh, l drive my people hard,
and then l reward them.

20
00:01:03,956 --> 00:01:06,026
-Like with dogs.
-Yeah, exactly.

21
00:01:06,196 --> 00:01:07,549
Party?

22
00:01:08,116 --> 00:01:10,346
-Yeah.
-Food?

23
00:01:11,156 --> 00:01:12,987
-Bar?
-Yeah.

24
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,226
George?

25
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:18,107
He's gonna show up anyway.

26
00:01:18,276 --> 00:01:20,267
George, l just don't
want you interfering.

27
00:01:20,436 --> 00:01:22,392
How could l possibly interfere?

28
00:01:22,556 --> 00:01:24,387
lsn't that what Jack Ruby said?

29
00:01:30,516 --> 00:01:32,984
These are fantastic. Fantastic.

30
00:01:33,156 --> 00:01:35,306
l'd love to get a jump
on the next batch.

31
00:01:35,476 --> 00:01:37,148
Where do you come out of?

32
00:01:40,996 --> 00:01:44,306
She's been ignoring this section
all evening.

33
00:01:45,636 --> 00:01:47,786
-Quesadilla?
-No, thanks.

34
00:01:49,236 --> 00:01:51,875
-Hi, my name is George.
-Anna.

35
00:01:53,156 --> 00:01:55,147
l don't recall seeing you
around the office.

36
00:01:55,316 --> 00:01:56,590
Do you work in the mailroom?

37
00:01:57,716 --> 00:02:00,913
Not quite. l-- l'm a friend
of Elaine Benes.

38
00:02:01,076 --> 00:02:03,715
Oh, that's nice. Excuse me.

39
00:02:03,876 --> 00:02:05,468
So....

40
00:02:06,956 --> 00:02:09,675
-How about leading us in a toast?
-Oh, sure.

41
00:02:09,836 --> 00:02:11,588
Hey, guys, l wanna make a toast.

42
00:02:12,876 --> 00:02:16,346
Here's to those who wish us well...

43
00:02:16,516 --> 00:02:19,872
...and those who don't
can go to hell.

44
00:02:23,316 --> 00:02:25,272
All right. Who's dancing?

45
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:26,630
Come on, who's dancing?

46
00:02:26,796 --> 00:02:30,675
You want--? You want me to get it
started? l'll get it started. All right.

47
00:02:44,196 --> 00:02:46,505
Come on, guys.
What's the holdup?

48
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:52,267
Sweet, fancy Moses.

49
00:02:58,516 --> 00:03:00,746
Hey. You get the tickets?

50
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:05,228
-Who needs two?
-Oh, mamacita! Let me see them.

51
00:03:05,396 --> 00:03:08,308
-Special sneak preview of Death Blow.
-Death Blow.

52
00:03:08,476 --> 00:03:11,752
When someone tries to blow you up,
not because of who you are...

53
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:14,828
...but because of different
reasons altogether.

54
00:03:16,716 --> 00:03:18,308
Yeah? Come on up.

55
00:03:18,476 --> 00:03:21,707
Jerry, you think you could get
an extra ticket for my friend Brody?

56
00:03:21,876 --> 00:03:23,707
You know what l had to go through?

57
00:03:23,876 --> 00:03:25,628
But he's a big fan of the genre.

58
00:03:25,796 --> 00:03:28,594
You know, l'd consider it
a personal favour to me.

59
00:03:29,956 --> 00:03:32,914
Yeah, l guess l do owe you. Yeah.

60
00:03:33,836 --> 00:03:36,066
You want me to stay here
until George gets up?

61
00:03:36,236 --> 00:03:38,830
-No, l'm okay.
-There's no problem, really.

62
00:03:38,996 --> 00:03:40,270
l'm fine.

63
00:03:41,316 --> 00:03:43,511
-He's right in there, boy.
-Yeah, okay.

64
00:03:43,676 --> 00:03:46,065
Hey, how was the party?

65
00:03:46,396 --> 00:03:47,590
The food was good.

66
00:03:47,756 --> 00:03:49,235
Yeah, so l didn't miss anything?

67
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:53,389
Well, actually, you did miss
one little nugget of entertainment.

68
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:56,232
Have you ever seen Elaine dance?

69
00:03:59,116 --> 00:04:00,913
Elaine danced?

70
00:04:02,836 --> 00:04:06,749
lt was more like a full-body
dry heave set to music.

71
00:04:08,156 --> 00:04:10,670
Did she do the little kicks
and the thumbs?

72
00:04:11,156 --> 00:04:13,670
-Wait, you mean you know about this?
-For some time.

73
00:04:14,076 --> 00:04:16,351
It was about five years ago.

74
00:04:27,596 --> 00:04:29,712
I never knew what to say to her
about it.

75
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:32,596
lt was one of those problems
l hoped would just go away.

76
00:04:32,756 --> 00:04:35,828
Sometimes you can't help
these people until they hit rock bottom.

77
00:04:35,996 --> 00:04:37,395
By then you've lost interest.

78
00:04:38,556 --> 00:04:43,072
Take a ride with me later.
l borrowed my father's car, '68 GTO.

79
00:04:43,236 --> 00:04:44,510
What made him get that?

80
00:04:44,676 --> 00:04:48,032
During that period when my folks
were separated, he went a little crazy.

81
00:04:48,196 --> 00:04:50,312
Not a very long trip.

82
00:04:51,156 --> 00:04:53,750
-Brody's in.
-l don't even have the extra ticket yet.

83
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:56,305
Well, you better get on the horn.

84
00:04:58,076 --> 00:05:00,067
l'm telling you, Jerry,
l'm getting a vibe.

85
00:05:00,236 --> 00:05:04,434
lf l didn't know better, l'd say the staff
completely lost respect for me.

86
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,154
How could that be?

87
00:05:06,316 --> 00:05:10,832
Well, Jerry, l mean,
it's like the feeling is palpable.

88
00:05:10,996 --> 00:05:12,907
Could it have to do with the party?

89
00:05:13,076 --> 00:05:15,465
No, George was there.
He said he had a great time.

90
00:05:15,636 --> 00:05:18,753
lt's George. l bet you this is
somehow George-related.

91
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:21,874
-Oh, what are you talking about?
-He's like a virus.

92
00:05:22,036 --> 00:05:25,153
He attaches himself
to a healthy host company...

93
00:05:25,316 --> 00:05:28,831
...and the next thing you know,
the entire staff is infected.

94
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,270
Now you're talking crazy.

95
00:05:30,436 --> 00:05:33,633
All right. Then if that's not
what it is, you tell me. What is it?

96
00:05:37,756 --> 00:05:40,907
There's my call waiting,
l gotta get going. Bye-bye.

97
00:05:43,236 --> 00:05:44,828
Have a minute
to approve some copy?

98
00:05:44,996 --> 00:05:47,226
Oh, yeah. Sure, sure.

99
00:05:48,676 --> 00:05:51,588
So did you have a good time
at the party last night?

100
00:05:51,756 --> 00:05:54,350
lt was a real kick.

101
00:05:55,476 --> 00:05:58,274
Hey, did you happen to speak
to my friend George?

102
00:05:58,796 --> 00:06:00,024
As a matter of fact, l did.

103
00:06:01,156 --> 00:06:04,751
Well, listen, you would be wise
to keep your distance from him.

104
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:06,588
Why? He seems harmless.

105
00:06:06,756 --> 00:06:09,224
Oh, he's not. He's very harmful.

106
00:06:10,116 --> 00:06:11,515
-Really?
-Oh, trust me.

107
00:06:11,676 --> 00:06:15,351
He's a bad seed, he's a horrible seed.
He's one of the worst seeds l've seen.

108
00:06:15,516 --> 00:06:17,074
And you two are friends?

109
00:06:17,236 --> 00:06:18,908
Yeah, we're good friends.

110
00:06:21,236 --> 00:06:24,034
So this Anna called me
from out of the blue.

111
00:06:24,196 --> 00:06:27,871
-Really? l thought you were rebuffed.
-With extreme prejudice.

112
00:06:28,036 --> 00:06:30,869
-Maybe Elaine put in a good word.
-No. See, that's the thing.

113
00:06:31,036 --> 00:06:34,631
Anna told me Elaine said l was one
of the worst seeds she'd ever seen.

114
00:06:34,796 --> 00:06:37,469
lnteresting.
She doesn't care for you.

115
00:06:37,636 --> 00:06:38,989
Then a stern warning.

116
00:06:39,156 --> 00:06:40,509
Suddenly a phone call.

117
00:06:42,156 --> 00:06:44,226
Seems Elaine's made you
the bad boy.

118
00:06:44,396 --> 00:06:47,229
And Anna digs the bad boy.

119
00:06:48,556 --> 00:06:50,353
l'm the bad boy.

120
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:54,152
l've never been the bad boy.

121
00:06:54,316 --> 00:06:56,955
You've been the bad employee,
the bad son, the bad friend.

122
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:58,788
Yes. Yes, yes.

123
00:06:58,956 --> 00:07:01,186
Bad fiancé, bad dinner guest,
bad credit risk.

124
00:07:01,356 --> 00:07:02,505
Okay, the point is made.

125
00:07:02,676 --> 00:07:05,952
The bad date, the bad sport,
the bad citizen.

126
00:07:06,836 --> 00:07:08,667
The bad tipper.

127
00:07:11,716 --> 00:07:13,308
Half of show business is here.

128
00:07:13,476 --> 00:07:16,627
Oh, there's Brody. Brody, over here.

129
00:07:17,636 --> 00:07:19,069
-Hey, Kramer.
-Yeah.

130
00:07:19,236 --> 00:07:22,308
And you must be Jerry.
Thanks for the ticket.

131
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:25,070
That's quite a feedbag
you're working on there.

132
00:07:26,356 --> 00:07:28,916
lt's for all of us. ls there a problem?

133
00:07:29,076 --> 00:07:31,749
Brody. Brody, come on,
he's just kidding.

134
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:34,589
He's a joke maker. Tell him, Jerry.

135
00:07:34,756 --> 00:07:36,348
l'm a joke maker.

136
00:07:37,876 --> 00:07:39,992
All right, here we go.

137
00:07:40,156 --> 00:07:42,147
Death Blow.

138
00:07:51,516 --> 00:07:52,869
Hey.

139
00:07:53,516 --> 00:07:54,744
What the hell is he doing?

140
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:57,305
Relax, he does that all the time.

141
00:07:59,516 --> 00:08:00,790
Does what?

142
00:08:00,956 --> 00:08:04,392
He's making a copy of the movie
for sale on the street.

143
00:08:06,396 --> 00:08:08,352
May l see you outside
for a moment, please?

144
00:08:08,516 --> 00:08:10,711
-No, l want to watch the movie.
-Outside!

145
00:08:10,876 --> 00:08:12,355
Come on.

146
00:08:12,516 --> 00:08:15,713
-Hey, have you seen Anna?
-Just left to meet your friend George.

147
00:08:15,876 --> 00:08:16,991
To meet George?

148
00:08:17,156 --> 00:08:19,226
-l knew it. Where did they go?
-The park, why?

149
00:08:19,396 --> 00:08:21,751
Don't you see?
George is in the bloodstream.

150
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,269
You stay away from him too.

151
00:08:25,396 --> 00:08:26,988
What do you mean, bootlegging?

152
00:08:27,156 --> 00:08:28,987
lt's a perfectly legitimate business.

153
00:08:29,156 --> 00:08:31,386
-lt's not legitimate.
-lt's a business.

154
00:08:31,556 --> 00:08:33,831
-Where did you meet this guy?
-Friend of a friend.

155
00:08:33,996 --> 00:08:37,625
You know Corky Ramirez up on 94th?
He and l are playing pachinko--

156
00:08:37,796 --> 00:08:39,070
Kramer.

157
00:08:41,956 --> 00:08:44,675
Man, we're missing the deathblow!

158
00:08:44,836 --> 00:08:46,792
l don't believe it.

159
00:08:52,756 --> 00:08:55,714
You know, l'm not supposed to be
talking to you.

160
00:08:56,516 --> 00:08:58,905
No one's putting a gun
to your head.

161
00:09:01,076 --> 00:09:03,544
Do l scare you?

162
00:09:03,716 --> 00:09:05,229
No.

163
00:09:07,316 --> 00:09:08,749
A little.

164
00:09:09,996 --> 00:09:11,145
Nice car.

165
00:09:11,556 --> 00:09:12,875
Yeah.

166
00:09:13,236 --> 00:09:14,430
She's a sweet ride.

167
00:09:15,116 --> 00:09:16,834
ls that your orthopaedic back pillow?

168
00:09:18,076 --> 00:09:19,395
Maybe.

169
00:09:19,876 --> 00:09:21,707
Well, is it, or isn't it?

170
00:09:23,236 --> 00:09:24,749
l guess not.

171
00:09:28,556 --> 00:09:30,512
-Stay away from her.
-l didn't do nothing.

172
00:09:30,676 --> 00:09:31,870
-Get in the car.
-But--

173
00:09:32,036 --> 00:09:34,914
You heard me, young lady.
Get in the car.

174
00:09:35,076 --> 00:09:37,271
And you! You should know better.

175
00:09:37,436 --> 00:09:39,552
l don't want you infecting my staff.

176
00:09:39,956 --> 00:09:41,628
Lighten up.

177
00:09:57,796 --> 00:09:59,468
Go get them, Death Blow.

178
00:09:59,636 --> 00:10:01,866
So, Death Blow, we meet again.

179
00:10:02,036 --> 00:10:03,230
Are you okay?

180
00:10:03,796 --> 00:10:05,309
l got a cramp.

181
00:10:05,476 --> 00:10:09,185
Well, it's no wonder.
You ate that entire bag of candy.

182
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,506
There it goes again.

183
00:10:13,676 --> 00:10:16,588
-Kramer, you gotta drive me home.
-What is going on over here?

184
00:10:16,756 --> 00:10:18,986
Jerry, finish shooting
the movie for me.

185
00:10:19,156 --> 00:10:21,306
Are you nuts? No way
l'm holding that thing.

186
00:10:21,476 --> 00:10:23,387
Jerry, the man is in pain.

187
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:26,354
lf he didn't lick his fingers
before he reached in the bag...

188
00:10:26,516 --> 00:10:28,586
...we would have eaten some.
Serves him right.

189
00:10:29,476 --> 00:10:31,307
What are you, some kind
of tough guy?

190
00:10:31,476 --> 00:10:34,752
Okay. Let's everybody just relax.

191
00:10:36,116 --> 00:10:38,789
-Take the camera.
-All right, l'm taking the camera.

192
00:10:38,956 --> 00:10:41,390
All right, come on, let's go.
Thanks, buddy.

193
00:10:42,196 --> 00:10:43,868
Oh, man.

194
00:10:52,396 --> 00:10:53,829
Hey.

195
00:10:54,716 --> 00:10:56,195
How was the rest of Death Blow?

196
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:59,268
-How was the rest of Death Blow?
-Who got the final deathblow?

197
00:10:59,436 --> 00:11:01,825
l thought that Hawaiian guy
had it coming to him.

198
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:03,952
You make me get a ticket
for this friend...

199
00:11:04,116 --> 00:11:06,994
...and then the guy forces me
to bootleg a movie at gunpoint?

200
00:11:07,156 --> 00:11:09,192
He's quite a character, isn't he?

201
00:11:09,356 --> 00:11:12,393
He came by here at 3:00
in the morning to pick up the tape.

202
00:11:12,556 --> 00:11:13,955
l was scared out of my mind.

203
00:11:15,316 --> 00:11:16,749
l'll get it.

204
00:11:17,196 --> 00:11:18,345
-Yup.
-It's Brody.

205
00:11:18,516 --> 00:11:21,189
Yeah, come on up.
lt's Brody, he's coming.

206
00:11:21,356 --> 00:11:23,711
Are you crazy?
l don't want to see this guy again.

207
00:11:23,876 --> 00:11:25,150
Jerry, you did him a favour.

208
00:11:25,316 --> 00:11:26,908
He probably wants to thank you.

209
00:11:27,076 --> 00:11:28,748
What if l didn't do it right?

210
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,793
lt's your first time. He'll understand.

211
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:33,424
People with guns don't understand.

212
00:11:33,596 --> 00:11:36,429
That's why they get guns.
Too many misunderstandings.

213
00:11:37,116 --> 00:11:39,425
-Hey, Brody.
-Hi.

214
00:11:39,596 --> 00:11:41,552
l have to talk to you about the tape.

215
00:11:41,716 --> 00:11:44,594
-Yeah.
-l've never seen such beautiful work.

216
00:11:44,756 --> 00:11:46,667
-What?
-You're a genius.

217
00:11:46,836 --> 00:11:50,272
The zoom-ins, the framing,
l was enchanted.

218
00:11:52,276 --> 00:11:53,595
Well...

219
00:11:53,756 --> 00:11:55,155
...l did the best l could.

220
00:11:57,076 --> 00:11:59,544
l got another project for you.
Here, go ahead.

221
00:11:59,716 --> 00:12:01,229
lt's called Cry, Cry Again.

222
00:12:01,396 --> 00:12:04,672
l was gonna give it to one of my
other guys, but it's an arty movie...

223
00:12:04,836 --> 00:12:07,555
...and quite frankly,
they don't have the sensibility.

224
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:14,232
-May l use your phone?
-Yeah, yeah. lt's under the couch.

225
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:18,596
Look at you.
You got another gig, huh?

226
00:12:18,756 --> 00:12:20,587
l don't want another gig.

227
00:12:20,756 --> 00:12:22,030
l'm not doing this.

228
00:12:22,196 --> 00:12:25,393
But you have a gift. Look, Jerry,
this is not your little comedy act.

229
00:12:25,556 --> 00:12:27,433
We're talking feature films here.

230
00:12:27,596 --> 00:12:29,552
We're talking federal crime here.

231
00:12:32,356 --> 00:12:35,632
l'll expect that tape
by 3:00 tomorrow.

232
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:38,390
-May l borrow this, please?
-Yeah, yeah, sure.

233
00:12:38,556 --> 00:12:40,274
You need a glove?

234
00:12:43,476 --> 00:12:46,070
'' l pressed through the rushes,
and there...

235
00:12:46,236 --> 00:12:49,034
...the native dancers whirled
before me...

236
00:12:49,196 --> 00:12:52,666
...limbs flailing, arms akimbo...

237
00:12:52,836 --> 00:12:54,827
...feet kicking up dust.''

238
00:12:54,996 --> 00:12:58,193
What? What is so funny?

239
00:12:58,356 --> 00:12:59,630
Sorry, l got hung up.

240
00:13:01,196 --> 00:13:02,549
At Yankee Stadium.

241
00:13:02,716 --> 00:13:05,071
This? lt's mine.

242
00:13:05,236 --> 00:13:08,672
Oh, really? Because it looks
a little big for you.

243
00:13:08,836 --> 00:13:11,873
lt looks like something
a short, stocky...

244
00:13:12,036 --> 00:13:15,028
...slow-witted, bald man...

245
00:13:15,316 --> 00:13:16,908
...might wear.

246
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:18,595
He's not stocky.

247
00:13:21,236 --> 00:13:24,433
Who did that? Who did that?

248
00:13:30,836 --> 00:13:34,431
The French guy fell off his bike.

249
00:13:34,796 --> 00:13:38,425
Oh, man, that's precious.

250
00:13:41,556 --> 00:13:42,989
No, no, no...

251
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,272
...no, no, no.

252
00:13:45,436 --> 00:13:47,347
What were you thinking
when you shot this?

253
00:13:47,516 --> 00:13:50,189
-What? That's fine.
-You know what this scene is about?

254
00:13:50,356 --> 00:13:52,665
Yeah, it's about a guy
buying a loaf of bread.

255
00:13:52,836 --> 00:13:55,350
No. Bread is his soul.

256
00:13:55,516 --> 00:13:59,145
He's trying to buy back
a loaf of his soul.

257
00:13:59,316 --> 00:14:01,352
Wha-- Where?

258
00:14:02,036 --> 00:14:05,187
No way you're giving this tape
to Brody and telling him l shot it.

259
00:14:05,356 --> 00:14:08,746
-He's not gonna know the difference.
-l don't care about Brody.

260
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:10,349
l was up on 96th Street today.

261
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,394
There was a kid, couldn't
have been more than 1 0 years old.

262
00:14:13,556 --> 00:14:16,229
He was asking a vendor
if he had any other bootlegs...

263
00:14:16,396 --> 00:14:18,830
...that looked as good
as Death Blow.

264
00:14:19,116 --> 00:14:20,754
That's who l care about.

265
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,986
The little kid who needs bootlegs.

266
00:14:23,156 --> 00:14:25,465
His parent or guardian
won't let him see...

267
00:14:25,636 --> 00:14:28,196
...the excessive violence
and strong sexual content...

268
00:14:28,356 --> 00:14:30,028
...you and l take for granted.

269
00:14:30,796 --> 00:14:32,024
So you'll do the movie?

270
00:14:32,196 --> 00:14:35,393
Oh. Oh, man. I sat in gum.

271
00:14:35,836 --> 00:14:37,667
l have to.

272
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:40,270
But l'm gonna need
to storyboard this whole thing.

273
00:14:40,436 --> 00:14:42,996
-Where are my Magic Markers?
-Right here.

274
00:14:43,156 --> 00:14:47,308
Well, l have lost
complete control of my staff.

275
00:14:47,476 --> 00:14:49,387
Why did l let George go
to that party?

276
00:14:49,876 --> 00:14:51,594
l mean, we were
having so much fun.

277
00:14:51,756 --> 00:14:55,465
l mean, we were wining,
we were dining, we were dancing.

278
00:14:57,676 --> 00:14:59,029
Please.

279
00:15:01,116 --> 00:15:03,949
-What?
-This...thing.

280
00:15:05,036 --> 00:15:07,869
-lt's dancing.
-No, no. That ain't dancing, sally.

281
00:15:08,036 --> 00:15:09,549
l dance fine.

282
00:15:09,716 --> 00:15:10,831
You stink.

283
00:15:14,596 --> 00:15:16,746
He doesn't know
what he's talking about.

284
00:15:21,276 --> 00:15:22,629
Jerry?

285
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,269
Jerry?

286
00:15:28,276 --> 00:15:30,187
l'm a good dancer, right?

287
00:15:30,356 --> 00:15:32,426
l forgot to make my bed.

288
00:15:34,196 --> 00:15:36,915
Jerry, do l stink?

289
00:15:37,796 --> 00:15:39,468
All right. You're beyond stink.

290
00:15:42,476 --> 00:15:44,068
But l really enjoy dancing.

291
00:15:44,236 --> 00:15:46,511
And that's not helping either.

292
00:15:47,836 --> 00:15:51,146
That's why you're having trouble with
your staff, not because of George.

293
00:15:51,316 --> 00:15:53,147
lt's that bad?

294
00:15:53,316 --> 00:15:54,669
Have you ever seen yourself?

295
00:15:57,556 --> 00:16:00,753
Please, please.
Not in my home.

296
00:16:01,116 --> 00:16:03,994
l gotta throw this stuff in the laundry.
l'll be right back.

297
00:16:12,156 --> 00:16:14,511
I have George Costanza
still holding.

298
00:16:15,276 --> 00:16:16,755
George, hi.

299
00:16:17,236 --> 00:16:20,353
l have Anna here. There's something
l want to say to both of you.

300
00:16:20,516 --> 00:16:21,710
Yo, Anna.

301
00:16:21,876 --> 00:16:24,231
Hi, George, what are you up to?

302
00:16:25,836 --> 00:16:28,066
You don't wanna know.

303
00:16:31,556 --> 00:16:33,990
Well, listen, l feel
really horrible about...

304
00:16:34,156 --> 00:16:37,990
...trying to keep you two apart,
and l just wanted to apologize.

305
00:16:38,156 --> 00:16:39,794
What--? What are you
talking about?

306
00:16:39,956 --> 00:16:43,266
Well, George, l just want you
to hear me say to Anna...

307
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:46,030
...that you're a good
and decent person.

308
00:16:46,196 --> 00:16:47,788
Pick up the phone, Elaine.
Pick up.

309
00:16:47,956 --> 00:16:49,867
l never should have given
the impression--

310
00:16:50,036 --> 00:16:51,708
-Pick it up!
-...you're a bad seed...

311
00:16:51,876 --> 00:16:53,275
...l mean, you're a fine seed.

312
00:16:53,436 --> 00:16:54,835
Elaine, get off the speak er!

313
00:16:56,636 --> 00:16:58,513
-What?
-You are ruining everything.

314
00:16:58,676 --> 00:17:02,032
What? l'm trying to help.
Why are you being so difficult?

315
00:17:02,196 --> 00:17:05,393
Yeah, yeah. That's it. More of that.
Difficult, l'm a difficult seed.

316
00:17:05,556 --> 00:17:07,626
George, l don't have time for this.

317
00:17:07,796 --> 00:17:10,026
Anna, do you want to
talk to George?

318
00:17:10,316 --> 00:17:12,352
-l don't think so.
-No, she doesn't want to.

319
00:17:12,516 --> 00:17:15,986
-Okay. Bye, George, we'll see you.
-I'm a bad man.

320
00:17:19,396 --> 00:17:20,749
So where's the tape?

321
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:23,794
Oh, l didn't shoot this one.
l'm just scouting the location.

322
00:17:24,236 --> 00:17:27,353
-l need the tape.
-You'll get your tape.

323
00:17:27,516 --> 00:17:30,030
But here's what l need.
l'm gonna need three cameras...

324
00:17:30,196 --> 00:17:33,074
...two on the floor, one in the balcony,
and l want headsets...

325
00:17:33,236 --> 00:17:36,194
...for the guys running them.
l want to be able to talk to them.

326
00:17:36,596 --> 00:17:38,507
Are you out of your mind?

327
00:17:38,676 --> 00:17:41,509
-Kramer, l-- You know....
-Yeah. l know, Jerry, it's okay.

328
00:17:41,676 --> 00:17:44,986
Yeah, look, Brody,
Jerry wants to do the bootleg.

329
00:17:45,156 --> 00:17:48,512
He's dying to do it, but if you don't
make him happy, the work suffers...

330
00:17:48,676 --> 00:17:50,667
...and then nobody's happy.

331
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:54,347
Just shoot the damn thing
so l can get it out on the street.

332
00:17:54,516 --> 00:17:56,427
That's it. l can't work like this.

333
00:17:56,596 --> 00:17:57,915
-Jerry--
-l'm off the project.

334
00:17:58,076 --> 00:17:59,304
Jerry!

335
00:18:01,556 --> 00:18:04,275
-l want the tape.
-Yeah, l-- l know.

336
00:18:06,356 --> 00:18:08,665
Well, l'm the good boy again.

337
00:18:08,836 --> 00:18:10,030
Can you believe that?

338
00:18:10,196 --> 00:18:12,756
They think they can get anyone
to shoot these bootlegs.

339
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:15,510
Anna actually has respect
for me now.

340
00:18:15,676 --> 00:18:17,109
lt's all over.

341
00:18:17,276 --> 00:18:20,586
The whole business has changed.
lt's all about money now.

342
00:18:20,756 --> 00:18:23,270
The sad thing is,
it's the kids that suffer.

343
00:18:24,996 --> 00:18:27,908
Listen, man, you gotta shoot
this movie for me.

344
00:18:28,076 --> 00:18:30,795
Brody, he's a reasonable man,
but he's insane.

345
00:18:31,316 --> 00:18:34,114
l'm not doing this anymore.
l don't know what l was thinking.

346
00:18:34,276 --> 00:18:36,073
lt's illegal, it's dangerous....

347
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,668
Did you say dangerous?

348
00:18:39,436 --> 00:18:40,915
l'm a bootlegger.

349
00:18:41,076 --> 00:18:43,590
-You're a what?
-Bootlegging a movie, baby.

350
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:45,109
lsn't that illegal?

351
00:18:45,276 --> 00:18:49,064
l could do hard time for this one.
And community service.

352
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:51,075
ls this your FiberCon?

353
00:18:54,316 --> 00:18:55,874
Get out of my way!

354
00:18:59,116 --> 00:19:00,913
Jerry, George got arrested.

355
00:19:01,076 --> 00:19:03,032
-What?
-Yeah. He went down at the Beekman.

356
00:19:03,196 --> 00:19:05,915
He tried to lam,
but they cheesed him.

357
00:19:06,076 --> 00:19:07,953
Oh, now l see.

358
00:19:10,396 --> 00:19:12,591
-Yeah?
-It's Brody. I'm coming up.

359
00:19:12,756 --> 00:19:13,905
What are we gonna do?

360
00:19:14,076 --> 00:19:15,714
Well, l gotta give him something.

361
00:19:15,876 --> 00:19:17,468
Come on. Where's that tape l shot?

362
00:19:17,636 --> 00:19:18,910
l think that's it.

363
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:20,953
Let's check it out.

364
00:19:33,316 --> 00:19:36,353
Sweet, fancy Moses.

365
00:19:37,036 --> 00:19:38,913
Jerry, she taped over
the whole ending.

366
00:19:41,516 --> 00:19:43,666
-Where's the tape?
-Well, it's--

367
00:19:43,836 --> 00:19:46,111
-ls that it?
-Yeah, yeah.

368
00:19:46,276 --> 00:19:47,994
Here it is, Brody.

369
00:19:48,556 --> 00:19:51,116
One copy of Cry, Cry Again.

370
00:19:51,796 --> 00:19:53,388
How'd it turn out?

371
00:19:53,556 --> 00:19:54,830
-Great.
-Great, yeah.

372
00:19:54,996 --> 00:19:57,874
Although the whole story
kind of comes apart at the end there.

373
00:19:58,036 --> 00:20:00,914
Out of nowhere there's this
dancer who appears to be injured.

374
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:02,828
Yeah. lt's a disturbing image.

375
00:20:02,996 --> 00:20:06,671
Yeah. So you cry,
and then when you see the dancing...

376
00:20:06,836 --> 00:20:08,110
...you cry again.

377
00:20:14,356 --> 00:20:17,268
lt's all right, George.
You'll pay a fine, and that'll be it.

378
00:20:17,436 --> 00:20:20,553
Why did the policeman
have to yell at me like that?

379
00:20:21,196 --> 00:20:23,312
-Anna.
-Oh, thanks for coming to pick me up.

380
00:20:23,476 --> 00:20:25,068
-l can explain.
-All right.

381
00:20:25,236 --> 00:20:26,908
We'll talk about it at the office.

382
00:20:27,076 --> 00:20:30,227
-Okay, where's my boy?
-Oh, my God.

383
00:20:30,756 --> 00:20:34,829
l'm sitting at home reading
a periodical, and this is the call l get?

384
00:20:34,996 --> 00:20:37,032
My son is a bootlegger?

385
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,635
Ow, Dad!

386
00:20:39,156 --> 00:20:41,511
-Who put you up to this? Was it her?
-All right.

387
00:20:41,676 --> 00:20:43,507
Wait, l think you've got it backwards.

388
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:46,065
George isn't clever enough
to hatch this.

389
00:20:46,236 --> 00:20:49,626
-You got that right.
-What the hell does that mean?

390
00:20:49,796 --> 00:20:52,435
That means whatever the hell
you want it to mean.

391
00:20:52,596 --> 00:20:54,348
You saying you want a piece of me?

392
00:20:55,876 --> 00:20:59,266
l could drop you like a bag of dirt.

393
00:21:00,116 --> 00:21:01,913
You want a piece of me?

394
00:21:02,076 --> 00:21:03,304
You got it!

395
00:21:11,396 --> 00:21:13,148
But he's an old man, Elaine.

396
00:21:13,316 --> 00:21:16,467
Well, he wrote the check,
and l cashed it.

397
00:21:16,636 --> 00:21:18,991
Here's that bootlegged
Death Blow that l shot.

398
00:21:19,156 --> 00:21:22,034
-Cry, Cry Again, l want to see that.
-No, you don't.

399
00:21:22,196 --> 00:21:24,027
-You shot Death Blow?
-Yeah.

400
00:21:24,196 --> 00:21:26,027
-lt was brilliant.
-Thank you.

401
00:21:26,196 --> 00:21:28,107
-You were big.
-l'm still big.

402
00:21:28,276 --> 00:21:30,551
lt's the bootlegs that got small.

403
00:21:30,716 --> 00:21:33,230
-How are things at the office? Normal?
-Pretty much.

404
00:21:33,396 --> 00:21:35,626
Although l still get the vibe
once in a while.

405
00:21:35,796 --> 00:21:37,832
Oh, l wouldn't worry about it.
