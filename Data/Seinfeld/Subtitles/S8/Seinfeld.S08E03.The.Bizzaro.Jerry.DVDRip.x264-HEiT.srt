1
00:00:04,606 --> 00:00:06,836
All right, how about this?
You're abducted by aliens.

2
00:00:07,006 --> 00:00:08,917
-Fine.
-Haul you aboard the mothership...

3
00:00:09,086 --> 00:00:11,361
...take you back to their planet
as a curiosity.

4
00:00:11,526 --> 00:00:14,802
Now, would you rather be
in their zoo or their circus?

5
00:00:15,246 --> 00:00:16,759
l gotta go zoo.

6
00:00:16,926 --> 00:00:19,360
l feel like l could set
more of my own schedule.

7
00:00:19,526 --> 00:00:22,359
ln the circus, you get to ride
on the train, see the whole planet.

8
00:00:22,526 --> 00:00:25,165
l'm wearing a little hat.
l'm jumping through fire.

9
00:00:25,326 --> 00:00:27,794
Putting their little alien heads
in my mouth.

10
00:00:28,646 --> 00:00:30,557
-At least it's show business.
-Yeah.

11
00:00:30,726 --> 00:00:33,684
But in the zoo, you know, they might
put a woman in there with me...

12
00:00:33,846 --> 00:00:35,359
...to, you know, get me to mate.

13
00:00:35,526 --> 00:00:37,517
What if she's got no interest in you?

14
00:00:37,686 --> 00:00:39,438
Then l'm pretty much
where l am right now.

15
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:41,517
Just got to take a ride
on a spaceship.

16
00:00:51,446 --> 00:00:53,755
George, why couldn't l use
the bathroom in that store?

17
00:00:53,926 --> 00:00:56,394
Kramer, trust me, this is
the best bathroom in Midtown.

18
00:00:57,006 --> 00:00:58,200
He knows.

19
00:00:58,366 --> 00:00:59,924
lt's right in there, on the left.

20
00:01:00,086 --> 00:01:04,284
Exquisite marble, high ceilings
and a flush like a jet engine:

21
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:09,402
Now, listen, you better not wait.
l'll catch you later.

22
00:01:09,566 --> 00:01:11,716
-You sure?
-He knows.

23
00:01:19,326 --> 00:01:20,441
Nice.

24
00:01:20,606 --> 00:01:23,518
Why don't you try
your engagement story?

25
00:01:26,566 --> 00:01:28,318
-Won't work.
-Are you sure?

26
00:01:29,446 --> 00:01:31,277
He knows.

27
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:37,441
Look, Kevin, l really like you...

28
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:43,915
...but maybe we'd be better off
just being friends.

29
00:01:44,326 --> 00:01:47,124
-Friends?
-Yeah. l mean--

30
00:01:47,926 --> 00:01:49,598
Oh, God...

31
00:01:49,766 --> 00:01:52,599
...this tuna tastes like an old sponge.

32
00:01:52,766 --> 00:01:57,203
Friends. Yeah. Why not friends?

33
00:01:57,366 --> 00:01:59,277
l might like to try that.

34
00:01:59,446 --> 00:02:00,879
Like you and Jerry.

35
00:02:07,966 --> 00:02:09,922
This damn thing is jammed again.

36
00:02:10,086 --> 00:02:11,519
You know what happens with these?

37
00:02:11,686 --> 00:02:14,359
The rollers,
they get flat spots on them.

38
00:02:16,566 --> 00:02:19,034
Hey, Leland wants everyone
in the conference room now.

39
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:23,119
-Come on, let's go.
-Oh, yeah.

40
00:02:23,926 --> 00:02:25,598
Okay.

41
00:02:29,086 --> 00:02:30,644
l was telling you about Gillian...

42
00:02:30,806 --> 00:02:32,922
...my friend who writes
for the L.L. Bean catalogue.

43
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:35,042
l really think
you should give her a call.

44
00:02:35,206 --> 00:02:37,242
l don't know, do you have it--?

45
00:02:39,446 --> 00:02:42,404
-Not bad. What does she--?
-l put her stats on the back.

46
00:02:44,566 --> 00:02:47,763
Pretty impressive.
Serious boyfriend, '92 to '95.

47
00:02:47,926 --> 00:02:49,598
-Owns her own car.
-Yup.

48
00:02:49,766 --> 00:02:52,360
Favourite president, James Polk.

49
00:02:52,726 --> 00:02:53,761
Let me see that.

50
00:02:53,926 --> 00:02:57,999
So how'd it go with Kevin? Did you
steel-toe his ass back to Kentucky?

51
00:02:58,566 --> 00:03:01,797
You are not gonna believe this. l told
him that l just wanted to be friends.

52
00:03:01,966 --> 00:03:05,242
He's fine with it.
He really wants to be friends.

53
00:03:05,406 --> 00:03:09,922
-Why would anybody want a friend?
-lt's really not that bad, actually.

54
00:03:10,086 --> 00:03:12,077
He said he'd go
to the Museum of Miniatures.

55
00:03:12,246 --> 00:03:14,157
This is something
you would never, ever do.

56
00:03:14,326 --> 00:03:17,124
l mean, all that stuff is so small.

57
00:03:18,366 --> 00:03:19,594
Stupid.

58
00:03:20,326 --> 00:03:23,602
You know, if l told my engagement
story to that receptionist...

59
00:03:23,766 --> 00:03:26,519
...but told her this was my fiancée....

60
00:03:26,686 --> 00:03:28,438
-What?
-Don't you see?

61
00:03:28,606 --> 00:03:33,680
Women like that are like members of a
secret tribe living in a forbidden city.

62
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:37,043
People like me have not been
inside in thousands of years.

63
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:41,760
But with this, it's like l've already
been with one of her own.

64
00:03:41,926 --> 00:03:45,475
My hand's been stamped.
l come and go as l please.

65
00:03:46,086 --> 00:03:47,599
Well, you've cracked it.

66
00:03:47,766 --> 00:03:50,724
l warned the queen
you were getting close and...

67
00:03:50,886 --> 00:03:54,515
...now it looks like we're gonna have to
move the whole damn forbidden city.

68
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:57,118
-Can l keep this?
-No, l need it.

69
00:03:57,286 --> 00:03:58,799
Thanks.

70
00:04:02,766 --> 00:04:06,805
Hi. l'm-- l'm here to see
a Mr. Art Vandalay.

71
00:04:06,966 --> 00:04:09,526
l'm sorry, sir,
there is no Mr. Vandalay here.

72
00:04:09,686 --> 00:04:11,039
Well, let me--

73
00:04:11,206 --> 00:04:15,358
Let me just check and make sure
l have the right name.

74
00:04:15,526 --> 00:04:17,357
l seem to-- Oh, l--

75
00:04:18,326 --> 00:04:21,238
Oh, she's beautiful. Who is she?

76
00:04:21,726 --> 00:04:25,082
Well, if you must know,
she was my fiancée, Susan.

77
00:04:25,246 --> 00:04:26,838
May she rest in peace.

78
00:04:27,006 --> 00:04:30,237
l am so sorry. She was lovely.

79
00:04:31,606 --> 00:04:34,245
-l'm Amanda.
-l'm George.

80
00:04:34,406 --> 00:04:36,601
-Good work today, K-Man.
-You know what they say:

81
00:04:36,766 --> 00:04:39,326
You don't sell the steak,
you sell the sizzle.

82
00:04:39,526 --> 00:04:42,484
-Who's up for drinks? l'm buying.
-ln that case, make mine a double.

83
00:04:46,526 --> 00:04:48,005
-Jerry?
-Gillian.

84
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:50,043
-Hi.
-lt's very nice to meet you.

85
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:52,322
lt's nice to meet you.

86
00:04:59,846 --> 00:05:02,406
She had man-hands.

87
00:05:05,406 --> 00:05:08,398
-Man-hands?
-The hands of a man.

88
00:05:08,566 --> 00:05:10,841
lt's like a creature
out of Greek mythology.

89
00:05:11,006 --> 00:05:15,045
l mean, she was like part woman,
part horrible beast.

90
00:05:16,006 --> 00:05:19,316
Would you prefer it
if she had no hands at all?

91
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,442
Would she have hooks?

92
00:05:23,526 --> 00:05:27,519
Do.... Do hooks make it
more attractive, Jerry?

93
00:05:28,646 --> 00:05:29,840
Kind of cool-looking.

94
00:05:31,246 --> 00:05:34,283
Okay, listen. You're picking me up
from White Plains tomorrow, right?

95
00:05:34,446 --> 00:05:35,435
Yeah. Yeah.

96
00:05:35,606 --> 00:05:37,597
Okay, l got five
huge boxes of buttons.

97
00:05:37,766 --> 00:05:40,644
lf you need an extra set of hands,
l know who you can call.

98
00:05:50,886 --> 00:05:52,877
-Kramer?
-Hey, buddy. Hey.

99
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:55,322
lt's 8 in the morning.
What the hell is going on?

100
00:05:55,486 --> 00:05:59,274
Breakfast. l gotta be in
at Brandt-Leland by 9.

101
00:05:59,766 --> 00:06:01,119
Why?

102
00:06:02,086 --> 00:06:04,475
Because l'm working there,
that's why.

103
00:06:04,646 --> 00:06:08,161
How long have l been asleep?
What year is it?

104
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,317
Look, Jerry, l don't know
if you've noticed...

105
00:06:10,486 --> 00:06:12,875
...but lately l've been
drifting aimlessly.

106
00:06:13,566 --> 00:06:14,965
Now that you mention it....

107
00:06:15,126 --> 00:06:18,084
But l finally realized
what's missing in my life.

108
00:06:18,246 --> 00:06:19,918
Structure.

109
00:06:20,086 --> 00:06:22,316
And at Brandt-Leland,
l'm getting things done.

110
00:06:22,486 --> 00:06:24,158
And l love the people
l'm working with.

111
00:06:24,766 --> 00:06:27,803
-How much are they paying you?
-No, no, no. l don't want any pay.

112
00:06:27,966 --> 00:06:30,002
l'm doing this just for me.

113
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,360
Clearly.

114
00:06:31,526 --> 00:06:33,562
So, what do you do
down there all day?

115
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,079
TCB.

116
00:06:35,246 --> 00:06:36,759
You know, taking care of business.

117
00:06:39,206 --> 00:06:41,674
l gotta go. All right, then.

118
00:06:41,846 --> 00:06:43,882
l'll see you tonight.

119
00:06:44,046 --> 00:06:45,877
Forget my briefcase.

120
00:06:46,046 --> 00:06:48,480
-Well, what do you got in there?
-Crackers.

121
00:07:19,246 --> 00:07:21,282
So the picture worked. Amazing!

122
00:07:21,446 --> 00:07:23,755
Hey, she wants me
to dress smart casual.

123
00:07:23,926 --> 00:07:25,200
What--? What is that?

124
00:07:25,366 --> 00:07:27,596
-l don't know, but you don't have it.
-Right. Bye.

125
00:07:34,406 --> 00:07:36,476
-Where were you today?
-What?

126
00:07:36,646 --> 00:07:37,920
Pick up.

127
00:07:38,886 --> 00:07:42,196
-Damn.
-So? Where were you?

128
00:07:42,366 --> 00:07:45,915
Here, l guess.
And l went out and picked up a paper.

129
00:07:46,086 --> 00:07:50,955
l had to ask Kevin to leave his office
and come and pick me up.

130
00:07:51,126 --> 00:07:52,923
-Well, what are friends for?
-Yes.

131
00:07:53,086 --> 00:07:54,485
And he is a friend, Jerry.

132
00:07:54,646 --> 00:08:00,164
He's reliable, he's considerate,
he's like your exact opposite.

133
00:08:00,326 --> 00:08:02,556
So he's Bizarro Jerry.

134
00:08:03,246 --> 00:08:04,395
Bizarro Jerry?

135
00:08:04,566 --> 00:08:05,919
Yeah, like Bizarro Superman.

136
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:09,044
Superman's exact opposite...

137
00:08:09,206 --> 00:08:11,481
...who lives in the backwards
Bizarro World.

138
00:08:12,286 --> 00:08:13,560
Up is down, down is up.

139
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:16,877
He says hello when he leaves,
goodbye when he arrives.

140
00:08:17,526 --> 00:08:19,915
Shouldn't he say '' badbye''?

141
00:08:20,086 --> 00:08:22,156
lsn't that the opposite of goodbye?

142
00:08:22,886 --> 00:08:24,399
No, it's still goodbye.

143
00:08:25,806 --> 00:08:27,478
-Does he live underwater?
-No.

144
00:08:27,646 --> 00:08:31,275
-ls he black?
-Just forget the whole thing, all right?

145
00:08:34,006 --> 00:08:35,678
Wow, man.

146
00:08:35,846 --> 00:08:38,076
What a day.

147
00:08:39,086 --> 00:08:41,759
-Could l use a drink!
-Tough day at the office?

148
00:08:41,926 --> 00:08:46,317
People kept coming in,
and that phone just wouldn't stop.

149
00:08:47,366 --> 00:08:50,324
We better get going if we're gonna
go to that 7:00 Hall of Fusion.

150
00:08:50,486 --> 00:08:52,841
Yeah, well, count me out.
l'm swimming in it.

151
00:08:53,006 --> 00:08:56,794
Old man Leland is busting
my hump over these reports.

152
00:08:56,966 --> 00:08:58,877
lf l don't get them done
by 9, l'm toast.

153
00:09:05,006 --> 00:09:07,076
All right, l have to go.

154
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:12,161
Oh, and listen, could you
keep it down to a low roar?

155
00:09:12,326 --> 00:09:15,921
Some of us have to work
in the morning. Thanks.

156
00:09:17,686 --> 00:09:19,756
This is a fantastic place.

157
00:09:20,046 --> 00:09:22,401
l always thought
it was a meat-packing plant.

158
00:09:22,566 --> 00:09:24,079
Hey, Amanda.

159
00:09:24,446 --> 00:09:28,758
These are my friends,
Annabell, Justina and Mickey.

160
00:09:28,926 --> 00:09:31,315
-We used to model together.
-Oh, modelling.

161
00:09:31,486 --> 00:09:32,965
What's that like, fun?

162
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:36,555
Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.

163
00:09:36,726 --> 00:09:38,956
So, Mickey,
how was Paris this time?

164
00:09:39,126 --> 00:09:40,320
A bore.

165
00:09:40,486 --> 00:09:45,606
You know who used to love Paris?
My dead fiancée, Susan.

166
00:09:45,766 --> 00:09:50,203
ln fact, l think l may have
a picture of her.

167
00:09:53,446 --> 00:09:55,118
She was beautiful.

168
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:57,040
Do you wanna dance?

169
00:10:02,406 --> 00:10:06,797
-Would you like some bread, Jerry?
-No. No, thanks, l'm just not hungry.

170
00:10:06,966 --> 00:10:09,434
Well, then, at least drink your beer.

171
00:10:12,206 --> 00:10:14,800
lt's not a twist-off.

172
00:10:15,606 --> 00:10:17,358
You have a little something
on your face.

173
00:10:17,926 --> 00:10:19,279
l can get it.

174
00:10:19,446 --> 00:10:21,835
No, no, no.
You're missing it. lt's higher.

175
00:10:24,966 --> 00:10:26,957
lt's an eyelash. Make a wish.

176
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,878
-l don't want to.
-Make a wish.

177
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:30,638
Okay.

178
00:10:33,046 --> 00:10:34,638
Didn't come true.

179
00:10:38,126 --> 00:10:39,923
Don't you just love lobster?

180
00:10:45,926 --> 00:10:48,121
That Museum of Miniatures
was amazing.

181
00:10:48,286 --> 00:10:50,038
-l know, it was so tiny.
-Yeah.

182
00:10:50,206 --> 00:10:52,322
Hey, guys. Elaine, sit down.

183
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:54,681
These are a couple of my friends.
This is Gene...

184
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:58,158
...and this guy we just call Feldman.

185
00:11:00,446 --> 00:11:02,960
Bizarro World.

186
00:11:08,406 --> 00:11:09,998
Jerry, it was incredible.

187
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,885
Models as far as the eye could see.

188
00:11:13,046 --> 00:11:16,436
-Then it does exist.
-Yes, the legends are true.

189
00:11:16,606 --> 00:11:18,198
When are you
going out with her again?

190
00:11:18,366 --> 00:11:19,515
l'm not.

191
00:11:19,686 --> 00:11:21,563
l'm inside the walls.

192
00:11:22,286 --> 00:11:24,004
So you're gonna burn that bridge.

193
00:11:24,766 --> 00:11:27,758
-Flame on!
-So when are we going?

194
00:11:28,326 --> 00:11:32,399
Well, it's a pretty fast-paced crowd.

195
00:11:32,806 --> 00:11:35,036
What would you wear? That?

196
00:11:35,206 --> 00:11:39,040
You know, l'm the one who's actually
dating the woman in the picture.

197
00:11:39,206 --> 00:11:40,355
Yeah.

198
00:11:40,526 --> 00:11:42,721
But l was engaged to her.

199
00:11:44,926 --> 00:11:46,564
-l got it.
-You got it last time.

200
00:11:46,726 --> 00:11:48,398
Don't worry about it.

201
00:11:48,566 --> 00:11:50,716
This is unbelievable.

202
00:11:50,886 --> 00:11:54,003
Say, Elaine, what do you think
of an alarm clock...

203
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,760
...that automatically tells you
the weather when you wake up?

204
00:11:57,486 --> 00:12:02,355
Well, l gotta say, l think that
that is a fantastic idea, Feldman.

205
00:12:03,206 --> 00:12:05,674
l don't know. lt's not practical.

206
00:12:05,846 --> 00:12:07,518
Well, see you later, Elaine.

207
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:09,722
Feldman and l gotta get down
to the library.

208
00:12:09,886 --> 00:12:12,878
-What are you gonna do down there?
-Read.

209
00:12:16,966 --> 00:12:18,877
Hello.

210
00:12:23,686 --> 00:12:27,725
So Gillian's coming over later.
l'm gonna end it.

211
00:12:29,606 --> 00:12:33,838
Those meaty paws. l feel like l'm
dating George ''The Animal'' Steele.

212
00:12:34,006 --> 00:12:35,439
Yeah.

213
00:12:35,966 --> 00:12:39,197
Maybe l'll chain her
to the refrigerator and sell tickets.

214
00:12:40,206 --> 00:12:41,400
That's nice.

215
00:12:41,566 --> 00:12:44,285
Kramer, put the paper down.
You never listen to me anymore.

216
00:12:44,446 --> 00:12:47,643
-We hardly even talk.
-Well, we're talking now, aren't we?

217
00:12:47,806 --> 00:12:50,161
-l see you 20 minutes in the morning...
-Oh, here we go.

218
00:12:50,326 --> 00:12:52,237
...and when you come home
you're exhausted.

219
00:12:52,406 --> 00:12:55,204
-We never do anything anymore.
-What are you starting with me for?

220
00:12:55,366 --> 00:12:57,596
You know this
is my crazy time of year.

221
00:13:00,326 --> 00:13:02,794
lt's your third day.

222
00:13:04,686 --> 00:13:07,678
l gotta go to work.
We'll talk about this later.

223
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,360
Well...

224
00:13:09,526 --> 00:13:11,994
...call if you're gonna be late.

225
00:13:14,526 --> 00:13:19,202
-What is going on with you two?
-Oh, l don't wanna talk about it.

226
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,797
All right, listen.
Have you seen my addre--?

227
00:13:22,966 --> 00:13:25,764
There it is. Okay. l got it.
l'll see you later.

228
00:13:25,926 --> 00:13:29,202
Hey, wait a second. Where you going?
l hardly ever see you anymore.

229
00:13:29,606 --> 00:13:31,403
Well, l--

230
00:13:32,206 --> 00:13:33,764
l guess l've been at Reggies.

231
00:13:33,926 --> 00:13:35,644
The Bizarro coffee shop?

232
00:13:35,806 --> 00:13:38,081
Kevin and his friends
are nice people.

233
00:13:38,246 --> 00:13:39,838
They do good things.

234
00:13:40,006 --> 00:13:42,236
-They read.
-l read.

235
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:44,078
Books, Jerry.

236
00:13:47,886 --> 00:13:49,558
Big deal.

237
00:13:52,486 --> 00:13:54,681
l can't spend the rest of my life...

238
00:13:54,846 --> 00:13:58,361
...coming into this stinking apartment
every 1 0 minutes...

239
00:13:58,526 --> 00:14:02,963
...to pore over
the excruciating minutiae...

240
00:14:03,126 --> 00:14:07,199
...of every single daily event.

241
00:14:07,366 --> 00:14:10,358
Why not? Like, yesterday, l went
to the bank to make a deposit...

242
00:14:10,526 --> 00:14:14,201
-...and the teller gives me this look--
-l'll see you later, man. l gotta go.

243
00:14:14,846 --> 00:14:17,804
The whole system is breaking down.

244
00:14:29,846 --> 00:14:32,565
Hey. Amanda, hi, yeah.

245
00:14:32,726 --> 00:14:36,082
Listen, you know, l'm thinking we
might just be better off being friends.

246
00:14:36,246 --> 00:14:39,363
Yeah. Yeah. You know what?
l can't really talk about it right now.

247
00:14:39,526 --> 00:14:41,278
Bye-bye.

248
00:14:44,966 --> 00:14:47,355
No. No!

249
00:14:47,526 --> 00:14:50,802
-Friends? Just friends.
-Yeah.

250
00:14:51,486 --> 00:14:54,478
All right. Well, do you still
wanna see a movie later?

251
00:14:54,886 --> 00:14:57,400
l wish l could, but we're friends.

252
00:14:59,046 --> 00:15:02,243
-l'm just gonna go wash my hands.
-Good idea.

253
00:15:03,126 --> 00:15:05,560
There's a beach towel on the rack.

254
00:15:07,886 --> 00:15:09,080
-Yeah.
-Jerry!

255
00:15:09,246 --> 00:15:10,804
My hair dryer ruined the picture.

256
00:15:10,966 --> 00:15:13,400
l need one or l can't
get back into the forbidden city.

257
00:15:14,486 --> 00:15:15,680
Who is this?

258
00:15:15,846 --> 00:15:18,565
Jerry! l need you to get
another picture of man-hands.

259
00:15:18,726 --> 00:15:20,478
I'm begging you.

260
00:15:21,926 --> 00:15:24,918
lf l get it, will you take me to that club
and show me a good time?

261
00:15:25,086 --> 00:15:26,678
Yes, yes, all right. Anything.

262
00:15:26,846 --> 00:15:28,677
Okay.

263
00:15:39,726 --> 00:15:40,920
Got it.

264
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:47,440
Jerry.

265
00:15:47,606 --> 00:15:49,915
-Hey, Jerry?
-l'm right here.

266
00:15:52,806 --> 00:15:56,037
-You're late.
-Yeah, well, l got held up, you know.

267
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:59,835
-What happened to your hand?
-Like you care.

268
00:16:00,006 --> 00:16:02,315
-Work piled up, l lost track of the time.
-Sure. Sure.

269
00:16:02,486 --> 00:16:04,920
You and your work.
Elaine's off in the Bizarro World...

270
00:16:05,086 --> 00:16:07,042
...George only calls
when he wants something...

271
00:16:07,206 --> 00:16:09,242
...and l'm left sitting here
like this chicken.

272
00:16:09,406 --> 00:16:13,285
Which, by the way, was for two.

273
00:16:13,446 --> 00:16:16,438
-What? You cooked?
-l ordered in. lt's still effort.

274
00:16:18,086 --> 00:16:19,235
-Jeez.
-What's wrong?

275
00:16:19,406 --> 00:16:22,079
-lt's my stomach.
-You're probably getting an ulcer.

276
00:16:22,246 --> 00:16:24,077
This job is killing you.

277
00:16:24,246 --> 00:16:26,362
lt's killing us.

278
00:16:26,526 --> 00:16:28,835
You know what? You're right.

279
00:16:29,006 --> 00:16:30,405
These reports, they can wait.

280
00:16:30,566 --> 00:16:32,443
Say we go out tonight.
Any place you want.

281
00:16:32,926 --> 00:16:34,359
-The coffee shop?
-You got it.

282
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:36,005
l'll call George.

283
00:16:38,886 --> 00:16:40,683
Hey, isn't that Elaine?

284
00:16:40,846 --> 00:16:42,325
Maybe she can get another picture.

285
00:16:42,486 --> 00:16:43,680
-Elaine?
-Elaine?

286
00:16:43,846 --> 00:16:46,076
-Elaine?
-Hey, Elaine.

287
00:16:46,246 --> 00:16:48,714
Hi. Over here.

288
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:02,842
Jerry, George, Kramer...

289
00:17:03,006 --> 00:17:08,126
...this is Kevin, Gene and Feldman.

290
00:17:09,126 --> 00:17:11,356
-Yeah.
-Nice to meet you.

291
00:17:12,046 --> 00:17:13,843
This is really weird.

292
00:17:15,926 --> 00:17:18,156
Could you guys excuse us
just for a moment?

293
00:17:18,326 --> 00:17:19,918
-Sure.
-Thanks.

294
00:17:21,286 --> 00:17:22,844
What? What do you guys want?

295
00:17:23,006 --> 00:17:25,076
l've got to have
another picture of Gillian.

296
00:17:25,246 --> 00:17:28,204
l tried to get him one, but man-hands
almost ripped my arm out.

297
00:17:28,366 --> 00:17:29,924
-You could have.
-l could not.

298
00:17:39,766 --> 00:17:43,998
Guys, l gotta go. Take it easy.

299
00:17:46,406 --> 00:17:48,317
Elaine?

300
00:17:49,886 --> 00:17:53,117
-Can l come?
-l'm sorry.

301
00:17:53,286 --> 00:17:55,004
We've already got a George.

302
00:18:03,046 --> 00:18:04,923
What did you wanna see
me about, Mr. Leland?

303
00:18:05,086 --> 00:18:09,284
Kramer, l've been reviewing your work.
Quite frankly, it stinks.

304
00:18:10,726 --> 00:18:12,364
Well, l....

305
00:18:12,526 --> 00:18:15,359
l've been having trouble at home.

306
00:18:15,526 --> 00:18:19,360
l mean, you know, l'll work harder,
nights, weekends, whatever it takes.

307
00:18:19,526 --> 00:18:22,916
No. No.
l don't think that's going to do it.

308
00:18:23,086 --> 00:18:25,361
These reports you handed in...

309
00:18:25,526 --> 00:18:28,598
...it's almost as if you have
no business training at all.

310
00:18:29,966 --> 00:18:32,560
l don't know
what this is supposed to be.

311
00:18:32,966 --> 00:18:36,561
Well, l'm just trying to get ahead.

312
00:18:37,246 --> 00:18:39,965
Well, l'm sorry. There's just no way
that we could keep you on.

313
00:18:40,566 --> 00:18:43,034
But l don't even really work here.

314
00:18:45,286 --> 00:18:47,197
That's what makes this so difficult.

315
00:18:53,126 --> 00:18:55,481
Hi, l'm George.

316
00:18:55,646 --> 00:18:57,557
Are you sure
you're supposed to be here?

317
00:18:57,726 --> 00:18:58,875
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

318
00:18:59,046 --> 00:19:00,638
l used to come here
with my fiancée...

319
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,036
...back when it was
a meat-packing plant.

320
00:19:03,206 --> 00:19:05,436
Here's her picture.

321
00:19:05,606 --> 00:19:08,564
What'd you do? Cut this out
of a magazine or something?

322
00:19:08,726 --> 00:19:10,557
-What?
-That's me.

323
00:19:10,726 --> 00:19:12,398
lt's from a Clinique ad l did.

324
00:19:13,606 --> 00:19:14,834
Look at that.

325
00:19:15,206 --> 00:19:17,845
Let's go. Private party.

326
00:19:20,206 --> 00:19:22,197
lt's Laney.

327
00:19:23,206 --> 00:19:25,720
-Hi, Elaine.
-Hi, Kevin.

328
00:19:26,126 --> 00:19:27,605
-Come on in.
-Okay.

329
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:28,755
Hi, Gene.

330
00:19:50,246 --> 00:19:52,965
-What's up?
-Just reading.

331
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,324
Hey, what are you doing?

332
00:20:02,966 --> 00:20:05,275
-Eating olives.
-Ever hear of asking?

333
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,316
-Who is it?
-Feldman.

334
00:20:10,486 --> 00:20:12,397
-From across the hall.
-Hold on.

335
00:20:18,326 --> 00:20:19,520
-Hey.
-Hey, Kevin.

336
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:22,484
-Hi.
-Look who l ran into.

337
00:20:23,446 --> 00:20:27,564
-Hello, Kevin.
-Hello, Vargas.

338
00:20:29,606 --> 00:20:31,642
-Wanna catch a game this weekend?
-Great.

339
00:20:31,806 --> 00:20:33,558
-l'll see you later.
-Okay.

340
00:20:33,926 --> 00:20:35,644
Vargas.

341
00:20:35,806 --> 00:20:38,684
-Well, l got them.
-All right.

342
00:20:38,846 --> 00:20:42,600
Hey, Elaine, Feldman was able
to get us all tickets to the Bolshoi.

343
00:20:42,766 --> 00:20:46,759
-Fourth row, centre.
-Get out!

344
00:20:48,366 --> 00:20:50,675
-What's the matter with you?
-Oh, Kevin.

345
00:20:50,846 --> 00:20:53,440
l'm so sorry.
ls there anything l can do?

346
00:20:53,606 --> 00:20:55,198
Haven't you done enough already?

347
00:20:58,686 --> 00:21:00,438
l'll just....

348
00:21:05,006 --> 00:21:06,155
lt's--

349
00:21:06,326 --> 00:21:07,805
lt's locked.

350
00:21:16,966 --> 00:21:19,161
So this is it, huh?

351
00:21:20,286 --> 00:21:21,435
But it was here.

352
00:21:21,606 --> 00:21:24,723
lt was here, l'm telling you.
lt was really here.

353
00:21:24,886 --> 00:21:28,959
There was a bar and a dance floor.

354
00:21:29,126 --> 00:21:31,686
l guess the DJ booth was over there
behind the bone saw?

355
00:21:33,206 --> 00:21:35,595
Let's get out of here, George.

356
00:21:48,606 --> 00:21:52,758
At work, l discovered a pay phone in
the lobby that has free long distance.

357
00:21:52,926 --> 00:21:53,995
Oh, so, what did you do?

358
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:56,919
l called the phone company
and immediately reported the error.

359
00:21:57,086 --> 00:21:58,883
Nice.

360
00:22:00,006 --> 00:22:01,917
-Who is it?
-Feldman.

361
00:22:02,086 --> 00:22:05,158
-From across the hall.
-Hold on.

362
00:22:09,126 --> 00:22:12,323
-Kevin. Brought you some groceries.
-Again?

363
00:22:12,486 --> 00:22:16,081
-Feldman, you didn't have to do that.
-Hey, what are friends for?

364
00:22:16,246 --> 00:22:17,884
You know,
l may not say this enough...

365
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:22,244
...but you two are about
the best friends a guy could have.

366
00:22:24,366 --> 00:22:26,118
Me so happy.

367
00:22:26,286 --> 00:22:28,595
Me want to cry.
