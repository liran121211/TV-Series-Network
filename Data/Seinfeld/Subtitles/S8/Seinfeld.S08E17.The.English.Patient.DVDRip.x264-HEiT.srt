1
00:00:05,557 --> 00:00:08,435
You know at the movies they show
that ad for the concessions?

2
00:00:08,597 --> 00:00:11,634
Where the cartoon candy's dancing
and the Milk Dud's playing the banjo?

3
00:00:11,797 --> 00:00:13,435
-Oh, he's wailing on that banjo.
-Yeah.

4
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:15,633
l just don't understand
the Raisinets.

5
00:00:15,797 --> 00:00:17,469
-The sax player? Yeah.
-Yeah.

6
00:00:17,877 --> 00:00:20,266
The box of Raisinets runs
up to the concession stand...

7
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:22,507
...buys another box of Raisinets.

8
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:24,956
-So?
-Box of Raisinets eating...

9
00:00:25,117 --> 00:00:27,233
...another box of Raisinets?

10
00:00:27,397 --> 00:00:28,591
lt's perverse.

11
00:00:28,997 --> 00:00:30,430
He's not gonna eat them.

12
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:33,191
He's buying them
for his Pepsi girlfriend.

13
00:00:33,357 --> 00:00:36,190
And why is he dating a Pepsi?
They're not having children.

14
00:00:36,357 --> 00:00:37,915
They're musicians.

15
00:00:38,077 --> 00:00:39,635
Musicians.

16
00:00:39,797 --> 00:00:41,992
Get a real job.

17
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:51,187
-What do you want?
-l've had everything on the menu.

18
00:00:51,357 --> 00:00:53,075
Surprise me.

19
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:56,515
Neil, Neil.

20
00:00:56,677 --> 00:01:00,192
Oh, l'm sorry. l'm supposed to
meet my boyfriend here.

21
00:01:00,357 --> 00:01:01,870
He looks just like you.

22
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:06,508
-Really?
-Yeah.

23
00:01:06,677 --> 00:01:08,588
-Like me?
-Yeah, sorry.

24
00:01:10,677 --> 00:01:12,235
Like me?

25
00:01:12,637 --> 00:01:13,956
But how?

26
00:01:14,117 --> 00:01:16,347
Here's your halibut omelette.

27
00:01:16,517 --> 00:01:20,430
-Surprised?
-Yes. Yes, l am.

28
00:01:22,597 --> 00:01:24,508
Look what l got for you
for your Florida trip.

29
00:01:24,917 --> 00:01:27,636
Crazy Shirts was closing them out.
l got a dozen for a buck.

30
00:01:29,037 --> 00:01:30,993
l saved a fortune. Look at that.

31
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:32,306
There you go.

32
00:01:33,637 --> 00:01:34,990
-'' Number-one dad.''
-Yeah.

33
00:01:35,157 --> 00:01:37,717
And it's a medium. Perfect.

34
00:01:38,837 --> 00:01:40,828
-Hey. Hey. You ready?
-Almost.

35
00:01:40,997 --> 00:01:43,147
Look, when you're
in Florida, can my cigar guy...

36
00:01:43,317 --> 00:01:45,387
...drop off some Cubans
for me at your parents'?

37
00:01:45,557 --> 00:01:47,593
l'm helping my parents
move into their new condo.

38
00:01:47,757 --> 00:01:51,272
-l'm gonna be busy.
-Oh, come on, man, help a brother out.

39
00:01:51,957 --> 00:01:54,676
-All right.
-Yeah. l owe you one.

40
00:01:54,837 --> 00:01:56,236
We're even.

41
00:01:57,477 --> 00:01:59,149
Hey, Jerry, figure this out.

42
00:01:59,317 --> 00:02:00,750
l'm in the coffee shop...

43
00:02:00,917 --> 00:02:03,670
...and this beautiful girl
l could never even talk to...

44
00:02:03,837 --> 00:02:05,828
...mistakes me for her boyfriend.

45
00:02:05,997 --> 00:02:08,192
That's a nice four seconds.

46
00:02:08,357 --> 00:02:12,111
l look just like him. l, me, this.

47
00:02:12,277 --> 00:02:14,837
This is what her boyfriend looks like.
How is that possible?

48
00:02:14,997 --> 00:02:17,033
-Maybe he has money.
-Maybe he doesn't.

49
00:02:17,197 --> 00:02:18,869
Maybe he and l are
exactly the same...

50
00:02:19,037 --> 00:02:21,676
...except for one minor
yet crucial detail.

51
00:02:22,077 --> 00:02:25,069
-You never know.
-Sometimes you do.

52
00:02:25,917 --> 00:02:28,829
Maybe it's some--
Some small thing l could change.

53
00:02:28,997 --> 00:02:31,306
Like a moustache
or wearing a top hat...

54
00:02:31,477 --> 00:02:33,832
...or a monocle or a cane.

55
00:02:33,997 --> 00:02:35,396
Who's she dating? Mr. Peanut?

56
00:02:39,637 --> 00:02:42,993
You could do a lot worse than
Mr. Peanut, my friend.

57
00:02:44,757 --> 00:02:46,076
So, what do you want to see?

58
00:02:46,237 --> 00:02:47,431
How about Sack Lunch?

59
00:02:48,757 --> 00:02:51,317
How about The English Patient?
lt's up for all those Oscars.

60
00:02:51,477 --> 00:02:54,037
Come on, Blaine, l mean,
look at the poster for Sack Lunch.

61
00:02:54,437 --> 00:02:56,905
lt's a family in a brown paper bag.

62
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:59,308
Don't you wanna know
how they got in there?

63
00:02:59,477 --> 00:03:00,705
No.

64
00:03:02,997 --> 00:03:06,433
-Oh, sold out.
-Oh, two for The English Patient.

65
00:03:06,797 --> 00:03:10,836
So do you think they got shrunk down,
or is it just a giant sack?

66
00:03:14,717 --> 00:03:16,628
Hi, remember me?

67
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:18,674
l'm the guy that looks like Neil.

68
00:03:18,837 --> 00:03:20,748
-Hi.
-Hi.

69
00:03:21,877 --> 00:03:23,469
ls Neil here?

70
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:25,150
Oh, no, he got held up at work.

71
00:03:25,317 --> 00:03:27,148
Oh, that's too bad.
l wanted to meet him...

72
00:03:27,317 --> 00:03:28,716
...seeing as we look so similar.

73
00:03:29,277 --> 00:03:31,871
Well, you know, you don't look
that much like him.

74
00:03:34,677 --> 00:03:36,907
-Of course not.
-No, you're a little taller.

75
00:03:40,837 --> 00:03:44,113
You look like you're in better shape
than Neil. Do you work out?

76
00:03:45,477 --> 00:03:48,275
Listen, l-- l don't mean
to seem forward...

77
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:51,190
...but is there any way
that l could possibly...

78
00:03:51,357 --> 00:03:53,587
...have Neil's phone number?

79
00:03:55,317 --> 00:03:57,228
What is everyone talking about:

80
00:03:57,397 --> 00:04:00,070
'' The English Patient,
it's so romantic''?

81
00:04:00,237 --> 00:04:02,831
God, that movie stunk.

82
00:04:02,997 --> 00:04:04,271
l kind of liked it.

83
00:04:04,437 --> 00:04:05,950
No, you didn't.

84
00:04:06,117 --> 00:04:09,632
Elaine, Blaine, did you just see
The English Patient?

85
00:04:09,797 --> 00:04:11,310
Didn't you love it?

86
00:04:11,477 --> 00:04:14,196
-No.
-How could you not love that movie?

87
00:04:14,357 --> 00:04:17,394
How about, it sucked.

88
00:04:18,357 --> 00:04:23,306
That Ralph Fiennes. l would give up
my firstborn for him.

89
00:04:24,077 --> 00:04:26,796
He's getting the short end
of that stick.

90
00:04:29,397 --> 00:04:32,707
Jerry, this is Del Boca Vista's
new physical fitness room.

91
00:04:32,877 --> 00:04:34,674
They got medicine balls.
You can bike ride.

92
00:04:34,837 --> 00:04:36,429
-Anything you want.
-StairMaster?

93
00:04:36,597 --> 00:04:38,189
-What?
-Nothing.

94
00:04:38,597 --> 00:04:41,236
-See what l'm wearing?
-Oh, did you get that out of my bag?

95
00:04:41,397 --> 00:04:43,274
No, your mother found it.

96
00:04:43,437 --> 00:04:45,667
Son, this is the most wonderful...

97
00:04:45,837 --> 00:04:48,067
...and thoughtful thing
you've ever done for me.

98
00:04:48,237 --> 00:04:51,115
You know, l bought you
a Cadillac. Twice.

99
00:04:53,717 --> 00:04:54,945
Oh, here he is.

100
00:04:55,117 --> 00:04:56,755
This is the man l wanted you to see.

101
00:04:56,917 --> 00:05:00,956
lzzy Mandelbaum.
He's 80 years old but strong as an ox.

102
00:05:01,117 --> 00:05:02,709
Watch this.

103
00:05:04,757 --> 00:05:06,349
See that? You couldn't do that.

104
00:05:06,517 --> 00:05:08,906
l could. l choose not to.

105
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:12,072
Hey, Morty, who's this?

106
00:05:12,237 --> 00:05:14,228
This is my son, Jerry,
from New York.

107
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:17,389
-He thinks he can lift more than lzzy.
-l didn't say that.

108
00:05:17,557 --> 00:05:21,436
Hey, lzzy, this kid says he can
lift more than you can.

109
00:05:22,637 --> 00:05:25,390
Hey, your kid's pretty funny, Morty.
He should be a comedian.

110
00:05:25,557 --> 00:05:28,435
-Actually, l am a comedian.
-That's not so funny.

111
00:05:29,957 --> 00:05:31,470
Think you're better than me, huh?

112
00:05:31,637 --> 00:05:34,754
lzzy used to work out
with Charles Atlas in the '50s.

113
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:36,555
1 850s?

114
00:05:36,717 --> 00:05:40,551
Well, that's it. lt's go time.
Let's see you lift that.

115
00:05:40,717 --> 00:05:42,116
-Mr. Mandelbaum--
-Come on.

116
00:05:42,277 --> 00:05:44,745
-Pump it.
-All right.

117
00:05:44,917 --> 00:05:48,796
Wrong attitude. You're not bringing
that trash into my house.

118
00:05:49,877 --> 00:05:51,469
There. All right?

119
00:05:51,637 --> 00:05:53,707
Step aside, string bean.

120
00:05:53,877 --> 00:05:55,515
l'll show you.

121
00:05:55,677 --> 00:05:58,032
l'm gonna take it up a notch.

122
00:06:01,197 --> 00:06:02,835
My back.

123
00:06:07,797 --> 00:06:09,788
Somebody call an ambulance.

124
00:06:09,957 --> 00:06:12,391
There's already an ambulance here
for Mrs. Glickman.

125
00:06:12,557 --> 00:06:14,673
There's room for one more.

126
00:06:16,997 --> 00:06:19,431
Hey, one for Sack Lunch.
lt's good, right?

127
00:06:19,597 --> 00:06:21,713
Yeah, good.

128
00:06:22,837 --> 00:06:24,270
Hey, what are you guys doing here?

129
00:06:24,437 --> 00:06:26,268
We just saw
The English Patient again.

130
00:06:26,437 --> 00:06:28,234
lt's even better the second time.

131
00:06:28,397 --> 00:06:29,876
They make it longer?

132
00:06:30,037 --> 00:06:31,550
Forgot my umbrella.

133
00:06:31,717 --> 00:06:33,548
-Blaine.
-Elaine.

134
00:06:33,717 --> 00:06:35,309
You said you were busy tonight.

135
00:06:36,277 --> 00:06:37,551
To tell you the truth, Elaine.

136
00:06:37,717 --> 00:06:40,914
l don't know if l can be with someone
who doesn't like The English Patient.

137
00:06:41,077 --> 00:06:43,113
lt's just a stupid movie.

138
00:06:43,717 --> 00:06:46,595
-That's what l'm talking about.
-Come on, Blaine.

139
00:06:46,757 --> 00:06:48,076
Let's go.

140
00:06:48,237 --> 00:06:50,307
Enjoy Sack Lunch.

141
00:06:50,957 --> 00:06:52,276
l will.

142
00:06:53,677 --> 00:06:55,474
How could you do that
to Mr. Mandelbaum?

143
00:06:55,637 --> 00:06:58,151
-You should be ashamed of yourself.
-He egged me on.

144
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:01,036
-You should be more mature.
-He's 80.

145
00:07:01,197 --> 00:07:05,668
Okay. Tomorrow Jerry and l
will visit lzzy and apologize.

146
00:07:05,837 --> 00:07:08,067
-Now, good night.
-You're not sleeping in that shirt.

147
00:07:08,237 --> 00:07:09,386
lt's too tight.

148
00:07:09,557 --> 00:07:12,435
-This shirt will never leave my body.
-Good night.

149
00:07:12,957 --> 00:07:16,313
All right, 7:30,
got the place to myself.

150
00:07:19,517 --> 00:07:21,712
-Jerry Seinfeld, please.
-You must be Kramer's guys.

151
00:07:21,877 --> 00:07:24,550
-Come on in. You got the cigars?
-What cigars?

152
00:07:24,717 --> 00:07:26,309
Kramer said to bring him
some Cubans.

153
00:07:26,477 --> 00:07:28,388
We are the Cubans.

154
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:37,990
Yeah, hello, Jerry's place.

155
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:39,636
They're real Cubans?

156
00:07:39,797 --> 00:07:42,516
They're human beings from Cuba?

157
00:07:42,677 --> 00:07:45,237
l said Cubans.
What did you think l meant?

158
00:07:45,397 --> 00:07:47,149
Cigars.

159
00:07:48,237 --> 00:07:51,673
Jerry, Cuban cigars
are illegal in this country.

160
00:07:51,837 --> 00:07:55,307
-That's why l got these guys.
-You're making your own cigars now?

161
00:07:55,477 --> 00:07:57,069
Yeah, l got investors all lined up.

162
00:07:57,237 --> 00:07:59,626
Hold on a second. Hi, Dad.

163
00:07:59,797 --> 00:08:01,674
-Who are they?
-They're Cuban cigar rollers.

164
00:08:01,837 --> 00:08:03,395
Don't tell your mother.

165
00:08:04,157 --> 00:08:06,830
What is that bubbling sound?
Are you making your tomato sauce?

166
00:08:07,157 --> 00:08:09,990
-Yeah, hot and spicy.
-You're not wearing a shirt, are you?

167
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:12,509
Yes, l am.

168
00:08:12,917 --> 00:08:14,748
What colour is it?

169
00:08:16,277 --> 00:08:17,869
Damn it.

170
00:08:20,837 --> 00:08:23,874
You know, you could have just
given me Neil's number.

171
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:25,789
You didn't have to
take me out to dinner.

172
00:08:25,957 --> 00:08:28,425
l wanted to give it to you in person.

173
00:08:28,597 --> 00:08:31,748
l don't have to be up in the morning
and l know a great breakfast place...

174
00:08:31,917 --> 00:08:33,396
...right around the corner.

175
00:08:35,237 --> 00:08:37,546
Does Neil like to
eat a big breakfast?

176
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:39,787
Why don't you come in?
We'll talk about it.

177
00:08:39,957 --> 00:08:41,106
l really should get going.

178
00:08:41,277 --> 00:08:43,472
l wanna be home in case Neil calls.

179
00:08:45,437 --> 00:08:48,588
Well, good night.

180
00:08:48,757 --> 00:08:50,395
l'll see you.

181
00:08:52,997 --> 00:08:54,510
Rough night?

182
00:08:54,677 --> 00:08:56,269
You wouldn't believe it.

183
00:08:56,437 --> 00:08:58,155
My boyfriend dumped me.

184
00:08:58,317 --> 00:08:59,830
My friends, who l don't even like...

185
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:02,227
...they won't talk to me,
all because l don't like...

186
00:09:02,397 --> 00:09:04,433
...that stupid English Patient movie.

187
00:09:04,597 --> 00:09:06,827
Really? l thought it was pretty good.

188
00:09:06,997 --> 00:09:08,316
Oh, come on.

189
00:09:08,477 --> 00:09:10,195
Good? What was good about it?

190
00:09:10,797 --> 00:09:13,869
Those sex scenes. l mean, please.

191
00:09:14,037 --> 00:09:16,870
Give me something l can use.

192
00:09:18,197 --> 00:09:20,108
Well, l liked it.

193
00:09:21,597 --> 00:09:24,111
You forgot about my piece of pie.

194
00:09:24,277 --> 00:09:25,756
Hello?

195
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:29,872
You know, sex in a tub.
That doesn't work.

196
00:09:37,637 --> 00:09:39,150
This is quite a condo.

197
00:09:39,317 --> 00:09:41,308
The Mandelbaums own
the Magic Pan restaurants.

198
00:09:41,477 --> 00:09:44,435
-The crepe place?
-Yeah, this is all big crepe money.

199
00:09:44,597 --> 00:09:45,825
There's crepe money?

200
00:09:46,677 --> 00:09:47,905
What are you doing here?

201
00:09:48,077 --> 00:09:49,669
Mr. Mandelbaum,
l wanted to come by...

202
00:09:49,837 --> 00:09:51,748
...tell you how sorry l was
you hurt yourself.

203
00:09:51,917 --> 00:09:53,635
What the hell is that?

204
00:09:53,797 --> 00:09:55,788
-What?
-That shirt.

205
00:09:55,957 --> 00:09:58,107
You think that you
are the number-one dad?

206
00:09:58,277 --> 00:10:00,188
This was a gift from my son.

207
00:10:00,357 --> 00:10:03,349
Oh, l see how it works now.

208
00:10:03,517 --> 00:10:05,826
He knocks me out of commission...

209
00:10:05,997 --> 00:10:10,115
...so you can strut around
in your fancy number-one shirt.

210
00:10:10,437 --> 00:10:13,713
Well, l'll show you
who's number one.

211
00:10:13,877 --> 00:10:17,472
-Mr. Mandelbaum, please.
-lt's go time.

212
00:10:20,357 --> 00:10:22,268
My back-- l can't move.

213
00:10:22,837 --> 00:10:26,625
-Call an ambulance.
-Think l saw one a couple doors down.

214
00:10:31,477 --> 00:10:32,751
So she wanted you to come up...

215
00:10:32,917 --> 00:10:37,069
...but you left because you thought
some guy might be calling you?

216
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:38,511
Some guy, some guy?

217
00:10:38,677 --> 00:10:40,190
Neil.

218
00:10:40,597 --> 00:10:43,748
l have got to find out
how he could get a girl like Danielle.

219
00:10:43,917 --> 00:10:46,670
George, you've got Danielle.
Forget about Neil.

220
00:10:46,837 --> 00:10:48,509
You've ''out-Neiled'' him.

221
00:10:49,717 --> 00:10:52,356
So l'm Neil. How did l do that?

222
00:10:52,517 --> 00:10:54,189
l don't know,
but you better keep it up.

223
00:10:54,997 --> 00:10:56,589
l'm gonna go meet Danielle.

224
00:10:56,757 --> 00:10:59,191
There's a new Neil in town.

225
00:11:02,117 --> 00:11:06,395
l try take a vacation. l come back,
the whole operation's in shambles.

226
00:11:06,557 --> 00:11:09,230
-Hello.
-Hey, Jerry. Number one here.

227
00:11:09,397 --> 00:11:11,228
Did you go see lzzy
at the back specialist?

228
00:11:11,397 --> 00:11:14,594
-l will. l just walked in the door.
-You have to go see him.

229
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,907
-Ma.
-Helen, will you stop bothering him?

230
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:18,795
Jerry, that shirt has gone
to his head.

231
00:11:18,957 --> 00:11:21,517
Number one, signing off.

232
00:11:22,877 --> 00:11:26,108
Jerry, l just picked up the Cubans
at the bus station.

233
00:11:26,757 --> 00:11:28,668
What's going on?

234
00:11:28,837 --> 00:11:30,509
-What?
-They're not real Cubans.

235
00:11:30,677 --> 00:11:33,396
-They're Dominicans.
-So?

236
00:11:33,557 --> 00:11:36,833
So, Jerry, if my investors
don't get Cubans, the whole deal's off.

237
00:11:36,997 --> 00:11:40,069
-What's the difference?
-Jerry, once you've had real Cubans...

238
00:11:40,237 --> 00:11:42,273
...there's just nothing else like it.

239
00:11:42,437 --> 00:11:44,029
We're talking about people, right?

240
00:11:44,197 --> 00:11:48,270
Yes, yes, the quality, the texture,
the intoxicating aroma.

241
00:11:48,437 --> 00:11:49,870
These guys don't have it.

242
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,390
l thought they smelled pretty nice.

243
00:11:52,557 --> 00:11:55,151
-Jerry, your palate's unrefined.
-ls not.

244
00:11:55,317 --> 00:11:56,716
-ls too. ls too.
-ls not.

245
00:11:56,877 --> 00:11:58,549
-l'm not having this conversation.
-Are too.

246
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:00,912
-Are too. Are too.
-Am not. Am not.

247
00:12:01,077 --> 00:12:03,227
Another productive meeting.

248
00:12:03,637 --> 00:12:07,152
By the way, l saw that
English Patient film last night.

249
00:12:07,317 --> 00:12:11,947
-lt was extraordinary.
-Oh, yes, it was so romantic.

250
00:12:12,117 --> 00:12:14,915
-lt ravished me.
-Elaine, what did you think?

251
00:12:16,917 --> 00:12:19,715
Well, actually l haven't seen it...

252
00:12:19,877 --> 00:12:23,392
...so l couldn't tell you
whether l liked it...

253
00:12:23,557 --> 00:12:26,515
...or whether it really sucked.

254
00:12:27,477 --> 00:12:29,707
-You haven't seen it?
-No.

255
00:12:29,877 --> 00:12:32,516
That's it. Drop everything.
We're going right now.

256
00:12:36,357 --> 00:12:39,394
Again, Mr. Mandelbaum, this back
specialist is supposed to be the best.

257
00:12:39,557 --> 00:12:43,106
lf there's anything else l can do, don't
hesitate to try and find my number.

258
00:12:43,277 --> 00:12:44,676
Oh, wait.

259
00:12:46,077 --> 00:12:48,113
How about that, huh?

260
00:12:48,597 --> 00:12:51,828
The ''World's Greatest Dad.''

261
00:12:51,997 --> 00:12:53,510
My son made it for me.

262
00:12:53,677 --> 00:12:55,952
-That's very nice.
-The best in the world...

263
00:12:56,117 --> 00:12:58,312
...which means l'm better
than just number one.

264
00:12:59,197 --> 00:13:02,030
Well, l don't know how official
any of these rankings really are.

265
00:13:03,317 --> 00:13:06,912
-Hi, Son.
-Hi, Daddy.

266
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,510
This is your son?

267
00:13:08,677 --> 00:13:10,633
l got married in high school.

268
00:13:11,317 --> 00:13:12,511
Hey, who are you?

269
00:13:12,677 --> 00:13:14,508
This is Seinfeld's kid.

270
00:13:14,677 --> 00:13:17,669
Oh, you think you're tough,
picking on an old man?

271
00:13:18,237 --> 00:13:21,673
Maybe you'd like to try taking on
somebody your own age.

272
00:13:21,837 --> 00:13:23,793
You got any kids?

273
00:13:25,717 --> 00:13:27,628
Oh, you think you're
better than me?

274
00:13:27,797 --> 00:13:29,867
Go ahead, pick out anything
in the room here.

275
00:13:30,037 --> 00:13:31,948
l'll lift it up over my head.

276
00:13:32,117 --> 00:13:34,347
Look, no one is lifting anything.

277
00:13:34,517 --> 00:13:36,553
The television.

278
00:13:38,357 --> 00:13:41,952
This one's for you, Pop. lt's go time.

279
00:13:42,997 --> 00:13:44,828
Oh, my back.

280
00:13:44,997 --> 00:13:48,433
-Call an ambulance.
-We're already in a hospital.

281
00:13:50,437 --> 00:13:52,997
All right, partner.
Let's get down to business.

282
00:13:53,157 --> 00:13:54,988
Okay. Well, l'll--
l'll get the Cubans.

283
00:13:55,157 --> 00:13:56,351
They're right out here.

284
00:14:00,557 --> 00:14:04,027
Yeah, here they are.
They're Cubans, real Cubans.

285
00:14:06,277 --> 00:14:08,427
You wouldn't be trying to sell
old Earl Haffler...

286
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:11,065
...Dominicans in a Cuban wrapper,
now, would you?

287
00:14:11,237 --> 00:14:13,068
Oh, come on, look at these boys.

288
00:14:13,237 --> 00:14:16,912
lf they were any more Cuban, Castro
would have smoked them himself.

289
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:21,232
-We're talking about people, right?
-l think so.

290
00:14:22,037 --> 00:14:24,028
l thought he quit smoking cigars.

291
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:28,509
Well, yeah, yeah, but they also rolled
for his brother, Dennis.

292
00:14:29,517 --> 00:14:32,714
-Dennis Castro?
-Dwayne.

293
00:14:34,237 --> 00:14:36,956
-Get the hell out of my office.
-What?

294
00:14:41,077 --> 00:14:43,875
-You know, Neil called me today.
-Really?

295
00:14:44,037 --> 00:14:46,756
Yeah, he's pretty upset l broke up
with him to go out with you.

296
00:14:46,917 --> 00:14:49,875
Well, l guess l showed
Neil who's Neil.

297
00:14:50,037 --> 00:14:52,187
He wanted to get together
tomorrow and have coffee.

298
00:14:52,357 --> 00:14:53,870
Coffee?

299
00:14:54,037 --> 00:14:56,551
l can beat that. Move in with me.

300
00:14:56,957 --> 00:14:59,551
-What?
-lt beats the hell out of coffee.

301
00:15:03,437 --> 00:15:06,907
And l thought l knew what love was.

302
00:15:14,757 --> 00:15:18,716
-You asked her to move in with you?
-l gotta stay one step ahead of Neil.

303
00:15:19,757 --> 00:15:21,475
What if it's Neil Armstrong?

304
00:15:23,437 --> 00:15:25,587
Then l'm going to Mars.

305
00:15:26,997 --> 00:15:30,512
-What if it's Neil Diamond?
-Oh, shut up, Jerry, just shut up.

306
00:15:30,677 --> 00:15:32,508
All right, l gotta go back
to the hospital.

307
00:15:32,677 --> 00:15:35,475
-What? To see the old guy?
-No, l got into a thing with the son...

308
00:15:35,637 --> 00:15:36,865
...and now he's laid up too.

309
00:15:37,557 --> 00:15:40,515
-How old's the son?
-l think he's the same age as the father.

310
00:15:41,037 --> 00:15:42,186
What is with this family?

311
00:15:42,357 --> 00:15:44,109
Don't know.
lt's like, one of them dies...

312
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,347
...the other one wants to
bench-press the casket.

313
00:15:49,437 --> 00:15:51,075
Hey, Jerry.

314
00:15:52,757 --> 00:15:54,270
You cold?

315
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:57,716
-lt's them, right?
-Something wrong your chin?

316
00:15:59,157 --> 00:16:00,670
-Where?
-No, no, no, don't look.

317
00:16:02,677 --> 00:16:05,475
Over there, the Dominicans.

318
00:16:06,157 --> 00:16:07,909
Aren't they supposed to be
rolling cigars?

319
00:16:08,077 --> 00:16:11,308
Well, it didn't quite work out and
now l've got nothing for them to do.

320
00:16:11,477 --> 00:16:13,707
-So?
-So l taught them all about Cuba...

321
00:16:13,877 --> 00:16:15,230
...and they really took to it.

322
00:16:15,397 --> 00:16:18,514
You know, Marxism,
the workers' revolution, the clothing.

323
00:16:20,077 --> 00:16:22,033
Boy, they seem pretty angry
about something.

324
00:16:22,197 --> 00:16:24,665
Yeah, l'm a little worried.

325
00:16:24,837 --> 00:16:26,987
When there's no work
and the people get restless...

326
00:16:27,157 --> 00:16:29,068
...who do you think they come after?

327
00:16:33,717 --> 00:16:36,834
l swear to you, l didn't know
the TV was bolted to the table.

328
00:16:37,837 --> 00:16:40,590
l bet you pulled that trick
on my daddy in Florida.

329
00:16:40,757 --> 00:16:42,429
He couldn't handle the weight.

330
00:16:42,597 --> 00:16:45,475
Oh, so now you think
you're better than me?

331
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:47,468
You think you're better than him?

332
00:16:47,637 --> 00:16:51,949
Look, let me just state for the record,
l think you're both better than me.

333
00:16:52,117 --> 00:16:53,470
Okay.

334
00:16:54,157 --> 00:16:55,636
My boys.

335
00:16:55,797 --> 00:16:58,595
-My dad.
-My grandpa.

336
00:16:58,757 --> 00:17:00,668
Oh, come on.

337
00:17:01,797 --> 00:17:02,991
What happened to him?

338
00:17:03,157 --> 00:17:05,068
He was trying to lift the TV.

339
00:17:05,237 --> 00:17:08,229
-That TV?
-Oh, no.

340
00:17:09,117 --> 00:17:10,994
lt's go time.

341
00:17:12,797 --> 00:17:16,153
Why didn't anybody tell me
it was bolted down?

342
00:17:16,317 --> 00:17:18,035
l still thought you could do it.

343
00:17:18,197 --> 00:17:19,391
Me too.

344
00:17:19,557 --> 00:17:22,993
Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum,
Mandelbaum.

345
00:17:23,157 --> 00:17:25,034
Fellas, fellas, fellas, look, l gotta go.

346
00:17:25,197 --> 00:17:26,676
Oh, yeah, that's right, go.

347
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,350
Put us all in the hospital...

348
00:17:28,517 --> 00:17:33,989
...and you ruined our business
with all your macho head games.

349
00:17:37,037 --> 00:17:39,312
-l didn't ruin your business.
-Yes, you did.

350
00:17:39,477 --> 00:17:42,708
There's nobody there now at
the Magic Pan to roll the crepes.

351
00:17:42,877 --> 00:17:45,949
-We gotta close it up.
-Don't you hire people to do that?

352
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:50,350
Each crepe has to be hand-rolled
by a Mandelbaum.

353
00:17:50,517 --> 00:17:53,793
That's what puts the magic
in Magic Pan.

354
00:17:57,477 --> 00:17:59,866
So you just need some guys
that could roll them?

355
00:18:00,277 --> 00:18:01,710
Yeah.

356
00:18:03,117 --> 00:18:05,392
l think l can help you out.
l'll see you later.

357
00:18:05,557 --> 00:18:07,866
Hey, l can't see the TV.

358
00:18:10,317 --> 00:18:11,875
Here.

359
00:18:13,277 --> 00:18:16,508
You think you're better than us,
don't you?

360
00:18:19,797 --> 00:18:21,708
Elaine, l hope you're
watching the clothes...

361
00:18:21,877 --> 00:18:25,756
...because l can't take my eyes
off the passion.

362
00:18:26,517 --> 00:18:28,428
No, l can't do this anymore.

363
00:18:28,597 --> 00:18:31,794
l can't. lt's too long.

364
00:18:31,957 --> 00:18:33,754
Quit telling your stupid story...

365
00:18:33,917 --> 00:18:38,195
...about the stupid desert
and just die already.

366
00:18:38,357 --> 00:18:40,154
Die!

367
00:18:42,237 --> 00:18:43,716
Elaine, you don't like the movie?

368
00:18:43,877 --> 00:18:45,469
l hate it!

369
00:18:45,637 --> 00:18:47,628
Oh, go to hell!

370
00:18:49,157 --> 00:18:51,990
Well, why didn't you say so
in the first place?

371
00:18:52,157 --> 00:18:55,354
-You're fired.
-Great. l'll wait for you outside.

372
00:18:57,997 --> 00:18:59,396
He was gonna fire you?

373
00:18:59,557 --> 00:19:01,593
Well, the only way
l could talk him out of it...

374
00:19:01,757 --> 00:19:04,271
...was that l agreed to go
and visit the Tunisian desert.

375
00:19:04,717 --> 00:19:06,947
-Tunisia?
-That's where they filmed the movie.

376
00:19:07,117 --> 00:19:09,153
lt's supposed to inspire me.

377
00:19:09,317 --> 00:19:12,036
-Well, that doesn't sound so bad.
-l have to live in a cave.

378
00:19:15,477 --> 00:19:18,196
These Dominicans really know
their way around a crepe, huh?

379
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:21,715
Look at that. Looks like they're
rolling a Double Corona.

380
00:19:21,877 --> 00:19:24,869
Just a cigar made out of Bisquick,
huh, Guillermo?

381
00:19:26,197 --> 00:19:27,471
l'm very happy with George.

382
00:19:27,637 --> 00:19:28,990
l'm sorry, Neil.

383
00:19:29,157 --> 00:19:30,795
lt's over.

384
00:19:30,957 --> 00:19:32,913
Come on, let's just eat our crepes.

385
00:19:36,437 --> 00:19:37,870
My face!

386
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:40,831
Neil!

387
00:19:41,517 --> 00:19:43,109
Why are the crepes spraying?

388
00:19:44,197 --> 00:19:47,269
The Dominicans are rolling them
too tight.

389
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:50,031
Well, that's why you gotta get
real Cubans.

390
00:19:56,877 --> 00:19:59,311
Danielle. Where's Neil?

391
00:19:59,957 --> 00:20:01,868
-ls this him?
-Yeah.

392
00:20:02,037 --> 00:20:03,948
That blueberry crepe
burned him pretty badly.

393
00:20:05,197 --> 00:20:06,425
Whose cane is this?

394
00:20:06,597 --> 00:20:08,110
lt's Neil's.

395
00:20:08,757 --> 00:20:09,906
Cane.

396
00:20:10,077 --> 00:20:11,476
l knew it.

397
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:15,628
So we meet at last.

398
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:19,392
l admire your skills, Mr. Peanut.

399
00:20:20,437 --> 00:20:22,189
Well, Danielle, we should get going.

400
00:20:22,357 --> 00:20:23,710
l got a key made for you.

401
00:20:23,877 --> 00:20:26,027
-George, l can't move in with you.
-What?

402
00:20:26,197 --> 00:20:28,916
l'm sorry, but l'm taking Neil
to a clinic in England.

403
00:20:29,077 --> 00:20:31,637
No, no, you can't leave me.

404
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:34,755
Marry me. l'll burn myself.
l'll burn my parents.

405
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,796
Sorry, George.

406
00:20:40,437 --> 00:20:42,189
George.

407
00:20:46,277 --> 00:20:47,790
l win.

408
00:21:10,557 --> 00:21:12,946
Ladies and gentlemen,
in just one moment...

409
00:21:13,117 --> 00:21:15,472
... we'll be showing
our feature presentation.

410
00:21:15,637 --> 00:21:17,707
No, no, no.

411
00:21:17,877 --> 00:21:21,233
The comedy hit, Sack Lunch,
starring Dabney Coleman.

412
00:21:21,597 --> 00:21:24,430
All right. Oh, this is shaping up.

413
00:21:24,597 --> 00:21:26,906
-Excuse me, please.
-Oh, sure.

414
00:21:31,197 --> 00:21:32,391
Ladies and gentlemen...

415
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:36,027
...because we have been exploited by
your Magic Pan crepe restaurants...

416
00:21:36,197 --> 00:21:38,916
...we are hijacking
this plane to Cuba.

417
00:21:39,317 --> 00:21:40,545
Everyone stay in your seats.

418
00:21:41,117 --> 00:21:42,835
And shut that movie off.

419
00:21:43,557 --> 00:21:45,388
Oh, nuts.

420
00:21:47,757 --> 00:21:50,396
Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum.
