1
00:00:06,482 --> 00:00:07,801
You're on a desert island.

2
00:00:07,962 --> 00:00:10,192
You can bring five books.
Which five do you take?

3
00:00:10,362 --> 00:00:11,636
l gotta read five books?

4
00:00:11,842 --> 00:00:13,958
All right, one.

5
00:00:15,042 --> 00:00:16,521
Come on.

6
00:00:16,682 --> 00:00:18,035
l got it. Three Musk eteers.

7
00:00:18,202 --> 00:00:21,080
-You've read that?
-No, l'm saving it for the island.

8
00:00:21,242 --> 00:00:23,597
All right, let's start
this whole thing over.

9
00:00:23,762 --> 00:00:26,401
Best Chamberlain:
Wilt, Richard, or Neville?

10
00:00:26,562 --> 00:00:27,551
For the desert island?

11
00:00:27,722 --> 00:00:29,394
-Okay.
-Richard.

12
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:31,393
You know, he was in
The Three Musk eteers.

13
00:00:31,562 --> 00:00:34,030
Exactly. Save me having
to read the book.

14
00:00:34,202 --> 00:00:35,681
What's going on over there?

15
00:00:35,842 --> 00:00:38,595
l don't know. l gotta see somebody.

16
00:00:44,522 --> 00:00:47,116
So, Marcy, you should have
seen me in the hot tub today.

17
00:00:47,282 --> 00:00:48,920
-Why?
-l was naked.

18
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:51,277
-Oh, George.
-l saw it.

19
00:00:51,442 --> 00:00:55,071
-How'd he look?
-Okay. l wouldn't see it again.

20
00:00:55,242 --> 00:00:58,359
A friend of mine thought she got
Legionnaires' disease in a hot tub.

21
00:00:58,522 --> 00:00:59,557
Really, what happened?

22
00:00:59,722 --> 00:01:01,678
Yada, yada, yada.
Just some bad egg salad.

23
00:01:01,842 --> 00:01:03,434
l'll be right back.

24
00:01:06,282 --> 00:01:08,000
-Nice girl.
-Lovely.

25
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:10,158
l notice she's big on
the phrase, ''Yada yada.''

26
00:01:10,322 --> 00:01:12,358
-ls ''yada yada'' bad?
-No, ''yada yada'''s good.

27
00:01:12,522 --> 00:01:14,592
-She's very succinct.
-She is succinct.

28
00:01:14,762 --> 00:01:16,514
Yeah, like you're dating USA Today.

29
00:01:17,962 --> 00:01:19,554
-Hey.
-Hey, Tim.

30
00:01:19,722 --> 00:01:22,520
-George, you know Tim Whatley.
-Yeah, dentist to the stars.

31
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:26,311
-What's up?
-l'll tell you what's up. l'm a Jew.

32
00:01:27,362 --> 00:01:28,636
-Excuse me?
-l'm a Jew.

33
00:01:28,802 --> 00:01:30,520
l finished converting two days ago.

34
00:01:30,962 --> 00:01:34,352
Oh, well, welcome aboard.

35
00:01:36,002 --> 00:01:39,199
-Thanks. So l'll see you tomorrow?
-Yeah, l have a cavity, lower left.

36
00:01:39,362 --> 00:01:41,353
-Were you just at the health club?
-Yeah.

37
00:01:41,522 --> 00:01:43,797
-We must have just missed you.
-l didn't do much.

38
00:01:43,962 --> 00:01:45,236
l just sat in the sauna.

39
00:01:45,402 --> 00:01:48,155
You know, it was more
like a Jewish workout.

40
00:01:48,322 --> 00:01:49,721
l'll see you.

41
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:57,712
Elaine, the guy's Jewish two days.
He's already making Jewish jokes.

42
00:01:58,322 --> 00:02:02,600
So what? When someone turns 21 ,
they usually get drunk the first night.

43
00:02:02,762 --> 00:02:04,354
Booze is not a religion.

44
00:02:04,522 --> 00:02:05,921
Tell that to my father.

45
00:02:07,202 --> 00:02:09,875
Anyway, guess what.
Beth Lookner called me.

46
00:02:10,042 --> 00:02:13,000
Beth Lookner.
l'm still waiting out that marriage.

47
00:02:13,162 --> 00:02:16,438
What are you talking about?
That marriage ended six months ago.

48
00:02:16,602 --> 00:02:18,240
She's already remarried.

49
00:02:18,402 --> 00:02:19,960
Where was l?

50
00:02:20,802 --> 00:02:22,121
lt was when you were engaged.

51
00:02:22,602 --> 00:02:26,038
Oh, l gotta get on that lnternet.
l'm late on everything.

52
00:02:26,722 --> 00:02:29,520
Anyway, so Beth
and her new husband, Arnie...

53
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:32,754
...have listed me as a reference
for an adoption agency.

54
00:02:32,922 --> 00:02:34,275
They're trying to get a baby.

55
00:02:34,442 --> 00:02:37,275
Oh, God, a baby.
That can add two years to a marriage.

56
00:02:38,962 --> 00:02:40,600
Hey. Elaine, all right.

57
00:02:40,762 --> 00:02:44,118
Who looks better in this shirt,
me or Mickey?

58
00:02:44,282 --> 00:02:45,556
We're double-dating tonight.

59
00:02:45,722 --> 00:02:48,077
lf we wear the same shirt
we'll look like idiots.

60
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:50,281
Turn around.

61
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:59,632
Well, you're both so striking.

62
00:02:59,802 --> 00:03:01,030
Yeah, tell me about it.

63
00:03:01,202 --> 00:03:02,794
We picked up two women at The Gap.

64
00:03:02,962 --> 00:03:05,920
How did you decide which one
of you would date which girl?

65
00:03:12,762 --> 00:03:16,277
So l'm on Third Avenue, minding my
own business and yada, yada, yada.

66
00:03:16,442 --> 00:03:19,036
l get a free massage and a facial.

67
00:03:20,522 --> 00:03:22,592
What a succinct story.

68
00:03:23,682 --> 00:03:25,513
So l'm surprised
you drive a Cadillac.

69
00:03:25,682 --> 00:03:27,991
Oh, it's not mine. lt's my mother's.

70
00:03:29,562 --> 00:03:31,041
Are you close with your parents?

71
00:03:31,202 --> 00:03:34,638
Well, they gave birth to me
and yada, yada.

72
00:03:34,802 --> 00:03:35,791
Yada what?

73
00:03:36,322 --> 00:03:39,120
Yada, yada, yada.

74
00:03:47,402 --> 00:03:48,676
lt's a nice place.

75
00:03:49,482 --> 00:03:51,313
Really nice.

76
00:03:52,042 --> 00:03:54,192
-l like your shirt.
-Oh, thank you.

77
00:03:54,362 --> 00:03:57,718
lt's a hundred percent cotton.
And some wool.

78
00:03:59,922 --> 00:04:02,994
Well, you two seem
to have the same taste.

79
00:04:03,482 --> 00:04:06,758
-Well, l like it too.
-Oh, well, l have the same shirt.

80
00:04:06,922 --> 00:04:08,640
Yeah, well, l'm wearing it.

81
00:04:10,122 --> 00:04:11,874
Well, l like your shirt too.

82
00:04:12,762 --> 00:04:14,320
Well, so do l.

83
00:04:20,242 --> 00:04:21,960
Did l mention l'm a serious actor?

84
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:25,081
-Really?
-l enjoy polo.

85
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:27,916
l like the beach.

86
00:04:28,842 --> 00:04:31,640
My aunt has been ill of late.

87
00:04:32,962 --> 00:04:34,680
l own a tuxedo.

88
00:04:36,202 --> 00:04:38,397
Anything to drink?
Some wine perhaps?

89
00:04:38,562 --> 00:04:40,314
-l like merlot.
-l love merlot.

90
00:04:40,482 --> 00:04:43,758
-l'm crazy about merlot.
-l live for merlot.

91
00:04:44,282 --> 00:04:45,715
We're out of merlot.

92
00:04:51,602 --> 00:04:53,240
We'll clear out for your interview.

93
00:04:53,402 --> 00:04:54,676
-Okay.
-Make us sound good.

94
00:04:54,842 --> 00:04:56,753
-Oh, come on.
-Bye.

95
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:58,878
-Bye, Beth. Bye, Arnie.
-Bye.

96
00:05:00,282 --> 00:05:01,840
Nice people.

97
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:04,914
So you know Beth and Arnie
pretty well?

98
00:05:05,082 --> 00:05:06,401
Oh, yeah, yeah.

99
00:05:06,562 --> 00:05:08,712
Do you socialize with them often?

100
00:05:08,882 --> 00:05:10,679
Yeah, yeah,
we go out to dinner a lot...

101
00:05:10,842 --> 00:05:13,481
...usually Chinese.
Well, sometimes Thai.

102
00:05:15,522 --> 00:05:18,514
And we go to the movies.
Arnie's a real film buff.

103
00:05:20,442 --> 00:05:22,592
Actually, l remember this one time.

104
00:05:22,762 --> 00:05:24,115
This is funny.

105
00:05:25,482 --> 00:05:27,632
We went to see
the movie Striptease.

106
00:05:27,802 --> 00:05:31,238
l don't know if you've seen it.
lt doesn't matter. Anyway.

107
00:05:31,842 --> 00:05:33,912
And it was during
the opening credits...

108
00:05:34,082 --> 00:05:36,232
...it was before
the movie even started.

109
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:38,597
And l was whispering
something to Beth...

110
00:05:38,762 --> 00:05:43,153
...and Arnie leans over to me
and he goes, ''Would you shut up?''

111
00:05:44,322 --> 00:05:47,120
l mean, he barely even knew me.
Where did he get off--?

112
00:05:58,362 --> 00:06:01,479
But they're great people.

113
00:06:05,602 --> 00:06:07,558
You're in here.

114
00:06:07,722 --> 00:06:10,475
-What are you doing here?
-l knew you had an appointment.

115
00:06:10,642 --> 00:06:12,758
Well, this is very awkward.

116
00:06:13,242 --> 00:06:14,800
l'll leave when the guy comes in.

117
00:06:15,322 --> 00:06:18,314
Hey, l gotta tell you.
l am loving this yada yada thing.

118
00:06:18,482 --> 00:06:20,712
You know, l can gloss over
my whole life story.

119
00:06:20,882 --> 00:06:23,521
-Look at that.
-Hey, don't play with that.

120
00:06:23,682 --> 00:06:25,479
That's going in my mouth.

121
00:06:26,002 --> 00:06:28,357
-What is this thing?
-All right. That's enough.

122
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:30,672
-Just get going. Get out of here.
-All right.

123
00:06:30,842 --> 00:06:32,355
-Hey, Tim. Quick question.
-Hey.

124
00:06:32,802 --> 00:06:35,441
ls it normal for your teeth
to make noises...

125
00:06:35,602 --> 00:06:37,320
...like a hissing or a chirping?

126
00:06:37,482 --> 00:06:38,835
George.

127
00:06:40,122 --> 00:06:42,920
Fine, l'll make an appointment.

128
00:06:43,082 --> 00:06:47,155
All right. lt is cavity time.

129
00:06:51,322 --> 00:06:52,596
Here we go.

130
00:06:52,762 --> 00:06:54,878
Reminds me,
you hear the one about the rabbi...

131
00:06:55,042 --> 00:06:57,158
...and the farmer's daughter, huh?

132
00:06:58,882 --> 00:07:01,157
''Those aren't matzo balls.''

133
00:07:02,762 --> 00:07:04,753
-What?
-Tim, do you think you should be...

134
00:07:04,922 --> 00:07:06,196
...making jokes like that?

135
00:07:06,362 --> 00:07:08,432
Why not? l'm Jewish. Remember?

136
00:07:09,322 --> 00:07:12,439
-l know, but--
-Jerry, it's our sense of humour...

137
00:07:12,602 --> 00:07:15,639
...that sustained us
as a people for 3000 years.

138
00:07:16,642 --> 00:07:19,952
-Five thousand.
-Five thousand, even better.

139
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:24,475
Okay. Chrissy...

140
00:07:24,642 --> 00:07:26,280
...give me a shtickl of fluoride.

141
00:07:30,802 --> 00:07:34,078
And then he asked the assistant
for a shtickl of fluoride.

142
00:07:34,882 --> 00:07:37,237
Why are you so
concerned about this?

143
00:07:37,402 --> 00:07:38,721
l'll tell you why.

144
00:07:38,882 --> 00:07:43,558
Because l believe Whatley
converted to Judaism just for the jokes.

145
00:07:46,602 --> 00:07:48,194
-Hello.
-Would you be interested...

146
00:07:48,362 --> 00:07:50,273
... in a subscription
to the New York Times?

147
00:07:50,442 --> 00:07:52,194
Yes.

148
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:00,674
-Well, l don't believe that.
-lf you'd got in the back seat...

149
00:08:00,842 --> 00:08:02,514
...we could've figured this out.

150
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:04,195
Why were you holding
the door open?

151
00:08:04,362 --> 00:08:07,115
Not for you.
Who holds a door open for a man?

152
00:08:07,282 --> 00:08:11,321
Well, l thought it was a nice gesture,
but l guess l was wrong.

153
00:08:11,922 --> 00:08:13,560
Let's just put their names in a hat.

154
00:08:13,722 --> 00:08:15,394
l don't even know their names.

155
00:08:16,442 --> 00:08:19,036
Look, why don't you take
the one on the left?

156
00:08:19,202 --> 00:08:22,274
-l'm not sure she's my type.
-Oh, everybody's your type.

157
00:08:22,442 --> 00:08:23,955
What the hell does that mean?

158
00:08:24,122 --> 00:08:26,875
-You've been married three times.
-That's it. lt's go time.

159
00:08:27,042 --> 00:08:29,476
-All right. Take it easy. Easy, easy.
-Hey, hey, hey!

160
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:32,475
No, come on, let him go.
You wanna throw? Let's throw!

161
00:08:32,642 --> 00:08:36,681
Hey, hey! Hold on a second.

162
00:08:38,642 --> 00:08:40,598
All right, look. l got an idea.

163
00:08:40,762 --> 00:08:43,560
Why don't you just
show up early for your next date...

164
00:08:43,722 --> 00:08:48,079
...sit across from each other
and see who the girls sit next to.

165
00:08:49,922 --> 00:08:52,356
-That's not bad.
-Right. So we let the girls decide.

166
00:08:52,522 --> 00:08:54,433
Yeah, why should we
knock ourselves out?

167
00:08:54,602 --> 00:08:57,799
-l wanna wear that shirt next time.
-No one wears the shirt next time.

168
00:08:57,962 --> 00:09:00,840
-Right, because they already saw it.
-We'll look like idiots.

169
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:05,798
Well, we.... We were engaged
to be married.

170
00:09:06,722 --> 00:09:10,112
We bought
the wedding invitations and...

171
00:09:10,602 --> 00:09:13,355
...yada, yada, yada. l'm still single.

172
00:09:14,482 --> 00:09:16,120
So, what's she doing now?

173
00:09:17,722 --> 00:09:19,121
Yada.

174
00:09:19,282 --> 00:09:22,831
-l get it.
-l love talking to you.

175
00:09:23,002 --> 00:09:26,597
Me too. So speaking of exes...

176
00:09:26,762 --> 00:09:29,037
...my old boyfriend
came over late last night...

177
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:34,037
...and yada, yada, yada.
Anyway, l'm really tired today.

178
00:09:44,482 --> 00:09:47,872
Beth, Arnie, hi. What's up?

179
00:09:48,402 --> 00:09:50,791
Well, our adoption
application was denied.

180
00:09:51,282 --> 00:09:53,796
-Really?
-The adoption agent seems to feel...

181
00:09:53,962 --> 00:09:55,873
...that Arnie has a violent temper.

182
00:09:57,562 --> 00:09:59,234
So we're just asking our friends...

183
00:09:59,402 --> 00:10:01,791
...what they may have said
to the adoption agent.

184
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:03,999
Well, l....

185
00:10:05,642 --> 00:10:08,202
You know, l just told them
what kind people you are...

186
00:10:09,802 --> 00:10:12,794
...and how Arnie's a big movie buff...

187
00:10:12,962 --> 00:10:16,841
...and yada, yada, yada. That is it.

188
00:10:21,042 --> 00:10:22,441
How you doing?

189
00:10:22,602 --> 00:10:24,274
l have some discomfort in my molar.

190
00:10:24,442 --> 00:10:26,194
You like Tootsie Rolls, don't you?

191
00:10:27,242 --> 00:10:29,517
Father Curtis, why don't you come in?

192
00:10:30,602 --> 00:10:32,991
Father Curtis, good guy.
Oh, which reminds me.

193
00:10:33,162 --> 00:10:36,518
Did you hear the one about the pope
and Raquel Welch on the lifeboat?

194
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,753
l'll tell you later.

195
00:10:40,762 --> 00:10:42,115
Whatley.

196
00:10:46,322 --> 00:10:47,880
What are they doing here?

197
00:10:48,042 --> 00:10:49,839
Told you we should've
gotten here early.

198
00:10:50,002 --> 00:10:52,038
All right. Okay, now what are
we going to do?

199
00:10:52,202 --> 00:10:53,271
All right. Don't panic.

200
00:10:53,442 --> 00:10:55,558
Let's just decide now.
Which one do you want?

201
00:10:56,882 --> 00:10:58,873
-l'll take Julie.
-l knew you wanted her.

202
00:10:59,042 --> 00:11:01,033
-That's who l wanted.
-l'll take Karen.

203
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,477
You think l'm falling for that?
l'll take Karen.

204
00:11:03,642 --> 00:11:06,031
Fine. l'll take Julie.

205
00:11:06,202 --> 00:11:08,079
All right. Which one is Julie?

206
00:11:10,682 --> 00:11:12,513
l don't know.

207
00:11:12,962 --> 00:11:15,396
-Why don't we just grab a chair?
-You first.

208
00:11:15,562 --> 00:11:17,154
No, you first.

209
00:11:18,882 --> 00:11:20,759
-How you doing?
-Good evening.

210
00:11:26,722 --> 00:11:28,633
Stop.

211
00:11:33,642 --> 00:11:36,361
Well, you ladies look lovely tonight.

212
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:45,596
So Whatley says to me,
'' Hey, l can make Catholic jokes.

213
00:11:45,762 --> 00:11:47,195
l used to be Catholic.''

214
00:11:47,362 --> 00:11:49,557
Now, see, l don't think it is
a Catholic joke.

215
00:11:49,722 --> 00:11:51,952
l think it's more
of a Raquel Welch joke.

216
00:11:52,122 --> 00:11:57,276
What was it?
'' No, l said, 'Hand me the buoys.'''

217
00:12:01,402 --> 00:12:03,393
'' Buoys.''

218
00:12:04,282 --> 00:12:06,876
Don't you see what Whatley is after?

219
00:12:07,042 --> 00:12:08,521
Total joke-telling immunity.

220
00:12:08,682 --> 00:12:10,798
He's already got
the big two religions covered.

221
00:12:10,962 --> 00:12:13,874
lf he ever gets Polish citizenship,
there'll be no stopping him.

222
00:12:14,322 --> 00:12:15,641
So, what are you going to do?

223
00:12:16,082 --> 00:12:18,915
l think this Father Curtis
might be very interested to hear...

224
00:12:19,082 --> 00:12:22,358
...what Whatley has
the pope doing with Raquel Welch.

225
00:12:23,882 --> 00:12:26,032
Hey, Beth, Arnie, it's Elaine.

226
00:12:26,202 --> 00:12:29,353
Thought you guys might wanna
have lunch. Give me a call. Bye.

227
00:12:29,522 --> 00:12:32,673
They're not getting a baby
so you're taking them to lunch.

228
00:12:33,162 --> 00:12:34,515
l thought it would be nice.

229
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:37,356
-Poor Beth.
-Hey, Arnie's just as upset.

230
00:12:37,522 --> 00:12:39,353
Oh, screw him.

231
00:12:40,282 --> 00:12:41,397
Listen to this.

232
00:12:41,562 --> 00:12:44,872
Marcy comes over, tells me her
ex-boyfriend was over late last night...

233
00:12:45,042 --> 00:12:48,352
...and ''Yada, yada, yada,
l'm really tired today.''

234
00:12:49,962 --> 00:12:54,080
-What do you think she's tired from?
-Well, obviously the yada yada.

235
00:12:55,162 --> 00:12:57,118
You don't think she'd yada yada sex?

236
00:12:58,042 --> 00:13:00,317
l've yada yada-ed sex.

237
00:13:00,482 --> 00:13:02,791
-Really?
-Yeah. l met this lawyer.

238
00:13:02,962 --> 00:13:05,157
We went out to dinner.
l had the lobster bisque.

239
00:13:05,322 --> 00:13:07,358
We went back to my place.
Yada, yada, yada...

240
00:13:07,522 --> 00:13:09,399
...l never heard from him again.

241
00:13:10,842 --> 00:13:12,833
But you yada yada-ed
over the best part.

242
00:13:13,002 --> 00:13:15,755
No, l mentioned the bisque.

243
00:13:19,762 --> 00:13:22,435
Well, l gotta do something.

244
00:13:25,122 --> 00:13:26,953
Well, l gotta do something.

245
00:13:27,122 --> 00:13:29,192
George is already in there.

246
00:13:31,442 --> 00:13:33,717
No, Mickey and l.
We can't work it out.

247
00:13:33,882 --> 00:13:37,318
You know, l'm thinking of asking
that Karen out by myself. She's the one.

248
00:13:37,482 --> 00:13:38,881
You were leaning toward Julie.

249
00:13:39,042 --> 00:13:42,159
Well, l was. But the one l thought
was Julie turned out to be Karen.

250
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:46,874
Well, it was a hell of a yada yada.

251
00:13:47,042 --> 00:13:49,272
He's moving to Seattle.
He wanted to say goodbye.

252
00:13:49,442 --> 00:13:52,161
l was just getting out of the shower
and yada, yada, yada--

253
00:13:52,322 --> 00:13:53,596
All right. Enough. Enough.

254
00:13:53,762 --> 00:13:58,711
From now on, no more yada yadas.
Just give me the full story.

255
00:13:58,882 --> 00:14:00,634
Okay. Well...

256
00:14:00,802 --> 00:14:03,077
...when l got out of the shower,
l was dripping--

257
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:05,881
Not that story. Another story.

258
00:14:06,042 --> 00:14:08,476
Tell me about the free facial.

259
00:14:09,002 --> 00:14:12,677
Okay, well, like l said,
l was on Third Avenue...

260
00:14:12,842 --> 00:14:14,878
...and l stopped by
a large department store.

261
00:14:15,042 --> 00:14:16,839
-Which one?
-Bloomingdale's.

262
00:14:17,002 --> 00:14:18,560
Very good. Go on.

263
00:14:19,602 --> 00:14:23,993
-And-- Oh, l stole a Piaget watch.
-What's that?

264
00:14:24,162 --> 00:14:27,234
And then l was on such a high...

265
00:14:27,402 --> 00:14:30,394
...that l went upstairs
to the salon on the fifth floor...

266
00:14:30,562 --> 00:14:35,682
...and got a massage and a facial
and skipped out on the bill.

267
00:14:41,242 --> 00:14:42,834
Shoplifting.

268
00:14:43,002 --> 00:14:46,392
Well, what about you?
You told me that you were engaged.

269
00:14:46,562 --> 00:14:48,075
What was the rest of that?

270
00:14:57,762 --> 00:14:58,990
Excuse me, Mother?

271
00:14:59,402 --> 00:15:01,438
-Sister.
-Sister. Right.

272
00:15:01,602 --> 00:15:03,957
Do you know when
Father Curtis has office hours?

273
00:15:04,122 --> 00:15:05,350
Well, not until tomorrow.

274
00:15:06,082 --> 00:15:08,312
l really need to speak with him.

275
00:15:33,282 --> 00:15:34,874
You know, that's a kneeler.

276
00:15:41,722 --> 00:15:43,121
Tell me your sins, my son.

277
00:15:43,282 --> 00:15:45,716
Well, l should mention
that l'm Jewish.

278
00:15:45,882 --> 00:15:48,476
-Oh, that's no sin.
-Oh, good.

279
00:15:50,682 --> 00:15:53,150
Anyway, l wanted to talk
to you about Dr. Whatley.

280
00:15:53,322 --> 00:15:54,596
l have a suspicion...

281
00:15:54,762 --> 00:15:58,641
...that he's converted
to Judaism purely for the jokes.

282
00:15:58,802 --> 00:16:01,236
And this offends you
as a Jewish person?

283
00:16:01,402 --> 00:16:04,075
No, it offends me as a comedian.

284
00:16:10,642 --> 00:16:15,079
And it'll interest you to know
that he's also telling Catholic jokes.

285
00:16:15,242 --> 00:16:18,279
-Well--
-And, l mean, they're old jokes.

286
00:16:18,442 --> 00:16:22,401
l mean, the pope
and Raquel Welch in a lifeboat.

287
00:16:22,562 --> 00:16:23,836
l haven't heard that one.

288
00:16:26,682 --> 00:16:29,480
Oh, l'm sure you have.
They're out on the ocean...

289
00:16:29,642 --> 00:16:31,633
...and yada, yada, yada and she--

290
00:16:31,802 --> 00:16:34,555
And she says, ''Those aren't buoys.''

291
00:16:40,882 --> 00:16:43,521
-Father.
-One second.

292
00:16:46,962 --> 00:16:50,159
Well, if it would make you feel better,
l could speak to Dr. Whatley.

293
00:16:50,322 --> 00:16:52,631
l have to go back and have
a wisdom tooth removed.

294
00:16:52,802 --> 00:16:54,440
Good luck.
You know the difference...

295
00:16:54,602 --> 00:16:57,196
...between a dentist
and a sadist, don't you?

296
00:16:57,362 --> 00:16:59,592
Newer magazines.

297
00:17:03,282 --> 00:17:05,079
That's funny.

298
00:17:05,242 --> 00:17:07,472
Now if you would excuse me.

299
00:17:09,002 --> 00:17:11,232
Jerry, l gotta talk to you.

300
00:17:22,562 --> 00:17:23,631
-Hi.
-Hi, Kramer.

301
00:17:24,082 --> 00:17:25,356
Got a minute?

302
00:17:25,922 --> 00:17:29,153
Actually, my parents are over,
but would you like to meet them?

303
00:17:29,322 --> 00:17:31,711
-Yeah.
-Mom, Dad.

304
00:17:32,482 --> 00:17:33,995
Hi.

305
00:17:42,322 --> 00:17:44,790
Elaine, l have to ask you
about something.

306
00:17:44,962 --> 00:17:46,793
-What?
-The yada yada.

307
00:17:46,962 --> 00:17:49,681
-Yada yada?
-What exactly happened down there?

308
00:17:51,322 --> 00:17:54,917
Well, l don't know.
l mean, l talked to him...

309
00:17:55,082 --> 00:18:00,236
...and blah, blah, blah.
He asked about you guys and:

310
00:18:00,402 --> 00:18:03,553
More questions. Blah, blah, blah.

311
00:18:03,722 --> 00:18:04,950
All right. Shut up.

312
00:18:06,042 --> 00:18:08,840
Shut up? Again you are telling me
to shut up?

313
00:18:09,002 --> 00:18:10,674
-What?
-You yelled at me...

314
00:18:10,842 --> 00:18:12,195
...that time at the movies.

315
00:18:12,362 --> 00:18:15,160
That's why you're not
getting the baby.

316
00:18:16,002 --> 00:18:17,913
And you told that to the adoption guy?

317
00:18:19,202 --> 00:18:21,841
-Slipped out.
-Oh, God.

318
00:18:22,002 --> 00:18:23,515
What am l gonna tell Beth?

319
00:18:24,762 --> 00:18:28,357
Well, Arnie, look, l'll go down
and talk to this adoption guy...

320
00:18:28,522 --> 00:18:30,638
...and make sure
it all gets straightened out.

321
00:18:30,802 --> 00:18:35,398
-Just don't screw it up this time!
-See, again you're yelling.

322
00:18:35,562 --> 00:18:37,951
Not a fan of the yelling.

323
00:18:44,922 --> 00:18:46,241
Are you about done?

324
00:18:46,682 --> 00:18:48,161
Oh, l'm just getting warmed up.

325
00:18:51,082 --> 00:18:54,154
Because l'm just a sadist
with newer magazines.

326
00:18:56,682 --> 00:19:00,470
Father Curtis told me your little joke.
l really didn't appreciate it.

327
00:19:00,922 --> 00:19:02,878
Well, what about
all your Jewish jokes?

328
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:05,431
l'm Jewish. You're not a dentist.

329
00:19:07,042 --> 00:19:10,432
You have no idea what my people
have been through.

330
00:19:12,602 --> 00:19:15,594
-The Jews?
-No, the dentists.

331
00:19:16,242 --> 00:19:19,040
You know, we have the highest
suicide rate of any profession.

332
00:19:19,522 --> 00:19:21,911
ls that why it's so hard
to get an appointment?

333
00:19:25,922 --> 00:19:30,438
So l'll.... l'll see you
tonight, huh? Okay.

334
00:19:31,362 --> 00:19:33,876
-Date with Karen?
-No, Julie.

335
00:19:34,042 --> 00:19:36,033
-She's the one.
-What happened to Karen?

336
00:19:36,202 --> 00:19:39,672
Well, Mickey and her have more
in common. Her parents are little people.

337
00:19:39,842 --> 00:19:41,833
Oh, small world.

338
00:19:42,642 --> 00:19:45,440
So little people can have
'' non-little-people'' children?

339
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:47,513
Oh, yeah, and vice versa.

340
00:19:47,682 --> 00:19:50,640
Yeah, Mother Nature's
a mad scientist, Jerry.

341
00:19:51,322 --> 00:19:53,517
So you won't believe
what happened with Whatley.

342
00:19:53,682 --> 00:19:57,436
lt got back to him that l made this little
dentist joke and he got all offended.

343
00:19:57,602 --> 00:20:00,241
Those people can be so touchy.

344
00:20:00,402 --> 00:20:04,839
-''Those people.'' Listen to yourself.
-What?

345
00:20:05,002 --> 00:20:07,914
You think that dentists
are so different from me and you?

346
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:12,394
They came to this country just like
everybody else in search of a dream.

347
00:20:12,562 --> 00:20:14,951
-Whatley's from Jersey.
-Yes, and now...

348
00:20:15,122 --> 00:20:17,238
...he's a full-fledged American.

349
00:20:17,402 --> 00:20:19,393
Kramer, he's just a dentist.

350
00:20:19,562 --> 00:20:21,871
Yeah, and you're an anti-dentite.

351
00:20:24,762 --> 00:20:26,354
l am not an anti-dentite.

352
00:20:26,522 --> 00:20:28,831
You're a rabid anti-dentite.

353
00:20:30,202 --> 00:20:32,670
Oh, it starts with a few jokes
and some slurs:

354
00:20:32,842 --> 00:20:34,639
'' Hey, denty.''

355
00:20:34,802 --> 00:20:38,158
Next thing you know, you're saying
they should have their own schools.

356
00:20:38,322 --> 00:20:41,439
-They do have their own schools.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah!

357
00:20:43,602 --> 00:20:48,437
Oh, come on. One little baby,
whatever you have in stock.

358
00:20:48,602 --> 00:20:50,797
-Miss Benes, please.
-Lookit, lookit, Brian.

359
00:20:51,642 --> 00:20:56,511
These people
are getting a baby, period.

360
00:20:56,682 --> 00:21:00,391
Now, we can do this the easy way...

361
00:21:00,562 --> 00:21:04,680
...or we can do this...

362
00:21:04,842 --> 00:21:06,514
...the fun way.

363
00:21:16,522 --> 00:21:18,638
l'm sorry to bother you.
But you always said...

364
00:21:18,802 --> 00:21:20,633
-...you'd be there for me.
-What's wrong?

365
00:21:20,802 --> 00:21:24,033
-l'm thinking of leaving Arnie.
-Talk to me.

366
00:21:25,522 --> 00:21:28,320
He met with Elaine,
and l asked him what happened.

367
00:21:28,482 --> 00:21:31,235
And he yada yada-ed me.

368
00:21:31,402 --> 00:21:32,915
Could they be having an affair?

369
00:21:33,082 --> 00:21:34,800
l wouldn't put anything past anybody.

370
00:21:34,962 --> 00:21:36,475
But we just got married.

371
00:21:36,642 --> 00:21:38,792
Well, obviously, that was a mistake.

372
00:21:38,962 --> 00:21:43,080
You need to forget about Arnie.
The important thing is you're moving on.

373
00:21:43,242 --> 00:21:45,198
Why would Elaine do that to me?

374
00:21:45,362 --> 00:21:48,354
Forget about Elaine.
Let's just focus on us.

375
00:21:48,522 --> 00:21:50,433
-Come on, big hug.
-Hey, Jerry.

376
00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:52,399
Where's Kramer?
l've got exciting news.

377
00:21:52,562 --> 00:21:55,360
-l'm in the middle of something.
-Karen and l getting married.

378
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:58,798
Oh, congratulations.
Her marriage just fell apart.

379
00:21:58,962 --> 00:22:01,237
-How many is that for you?
-Two.

380
00:22:01,402 --> 00:22:04,360
You're a lightweight.
Come on, honey.

381
00:22:11,522 --> 00:22:13,592
This church give you any ideas?

382
00:22:15,682 --> 00:22:16,956
-Hey, Jerry.
-Hey.

383
00:22:20,202 --> 00:22:22,033
What are you doing here with Beth?

384
00:22:22,482 --> 00:22:23,995
Beth and Arnie broke up.

385
00:22:24,522 --> 00:22:26,274
So they don't want a baby?

386
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:38,793
l think l'm gonna be sick.

387
00:22:42,602 --> 00:22:44,399
Hey, where's Marcy?

388
00:22:44,962 --> 00:22:49,433
She went shopping
for some shoes for the wedding...

389
00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:53,197
...and yada, yada, yada,
l'll see her in six to eight months.

390
00:22:58,122 --> 00:23:01,114
-Hey, Kramer, over here.
-l'd just as soon not sit next to you.

391
00:23:01,842 --> 00:23:03,639
Kramer.

392
00:23:09,562 --> 00:23:13,157
-Look, there's Mickey and his parents.
-Oh, a nice-looking family.

393
00:23:13,322 --> 00:23:14,801
Very handsome.

394
00:23:15,402 --> 00:23:17,279
How you doing?

395
00:23:17,442 --> 00:23:19,194
Hey, Kramer.

396
00:23:26,722 --> 00:23:28,678
You must be so proud.

397
00:23:28,842 --> 00:23:31,117
We never thought he'd settle down.

398
00:23:31,322 --> 00:23:33,153
Well, not again.

399
00:23:35,282 --> 00:23:39,355
Oh, Mickey. Excuse me.
l can't take this.

400
00:23:45,362 --> 00:23:47,592
Hi, Mr. Abbott.

401
00:23:48,522 --> 00:23:51,673
That's Dr. Abbott, D.D.S.

402
00:23:51,842 --> 00:23:54,310
Tim Whatley was one of my students.

403
00:23:54,482 --> 00:23:56,791
And if this wasn't
my son's wedding day...

404
00:23:56,962 --> 00:24:01,274
...l'd knock your teeth out,
you anti-dentite bastard.

405
00:24:02,842 --> 00:24:04,673
What was that all about?

406
00:24:04,842 --> 00:24:08,596
Oh, l said something about dentists,
and it got blown all out of proportion.

407
00:24:09,082 --> 00:24:12,472
Hey, what do you call a doctor
who fails out of med school?

408
00:24:12,642 --> 00:24:15,202
-What?
-A dentist.

409
00:24:15,802 --> 00:24:17,872
-That's a good one.
-Yeah.

410
00:24:18,042 --> 00:24:20,681
-Dentists.
-Yeah, who needs them?

411
00:24:20,842 --> 00:24:22,719
Not to mention
the blacks and the Jews.

412
00:24:39,202 --> 00:24:42,831
-Where's Beth?
-She ran out to get her head shaved.

413
00:24:43,442 --> 00:24:46,115
We are gathered here today
to unite this couple...

414
00:24:46,282 --> 00:24:49,718
...in the bonds of holy matrimony.

415
00:24:50,202 --> 00:24:52,557
Those wisdom teeth
are tough to get out.

416
00:24:52,722 --> 00:24:56,874
Marriage is not an institution
to be entered into lightly.

417
00:24:57,042 --> 00:25:00,239
Yada, yada, yada.
l pronounce you man and wife.

418
00:25:13,282 --> 00:25:15,671
l really wanted you.
