1
00:00:05,197 --> 00:00:09,076
Hey, if l were a gigolo, how much
do you think l could charge a night?

2
00:00:09,517 --> 00:00:12,031
-Here or in Japan?
-What's the difference?

3
00:00:12,197 --> 00:00:14,472
Well, the Japanese
are more enlightened.

4
00:00:14,637 --> 00:00:17,868
They can see beyond the physical.

5
00:00:18,517 --> 00:00:20,348
Forget Japan.
How much would you pay?

6
00:00:20,517 --> 00:00:24,271
Oh, l don't know. A dollar.

7
00:00:24,437 --> 00:00:26,746
l think l'm worth at least 300.

8
00:00:28,037 --> 00:00:29,629
l don't think so.

9
00:00:29,797 --> 00:00:33,073
-Hey, that's for all night.
-l know.

10
00:00:33,237 --> 00:00:34,989
-You're demeaning me.
-You're a gigolo.

11
00:00:35,157 --> 00:00:36,988
Well, you hired me.
l'm the victim here.

12
00:00:37,157 --> 00:00:38,670
Did l force you into this life?

13
00:00:38,837 --> 00:00:42,386
Yes. You and every woman like you.

14
00:00:46,917 --> 00:00:50,148
-Look how dark it's getting already.
-lt's not daylight-savings time yet.

15
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:52,273
When does it start?

16
00:00:52,437 --> 00:00:54,268
Don't know.
They tell you the night before.

17
00:00:54,677 --> 00:00:56,508
Well, l'm sick of waiting.

18
00:00:56,677 --> 00:00:58,952
l am springing ahead right now.

19
00:00:59,117 --> 00:01:01,836
Oh, l'm sure
that won't cause any problems.

20
00:01:01,997 --> 00:01:04,192
Oh, God, it's Mike Moffet.

21
00:01:04,357 --> 00:01:07,155
Don't tell me you're still mad
at him for calling you a phoney.

22
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,750
Jerry, that was five years ago.

23
00:01:08,917 --> 00:01:11,385
l'm not a phoney. l don't want
anything to do with this guy.

24
00:01:11,557 --> 00:01:13,548
Mike! Mike.

25
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:17,149
Kramer, Jerry, how's it going?

26
00:01:17,317 --> 00:01:18,989
Fine. And l'm not just saying that.

27
00:01:19,797 --> 00:01:22,516
Guess what. l just started
my own business. l'm a bookie.

28
00:01:22,677 --> 00:01:24,668
No openings in arson?

29
00:01:25,317 --> 00:01:28,229
Either of you guys wanna place a bet,
l'm your guy.

30
00:01:28,397 --> 00:01:31,275
No, no, no. No bets for me.
l got a disease.

31
00:01:32,197 --> 00:01:35,155
l'm feeling a bit queasy myself. Maybe
l'll see you in another five years.

32
00:01:38,077 --> 00:01:39,874
Jerry's still mad
about that phoney thing?

33
00:01:40,037 --> 00:01:43,154
Are you kidding?
lt's all water near a bridge.

34
00:01:43,317 --> 00:01:46,150
-Oh, what time do you got?
-Oh, yes.

35
00:01:46,317 --> 00:01:50,276
-lt's almost 6.
-Whoa, l'm really late.

36
00:01:54,997 --> 00:01:56,749
These designs look great.

37
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:59,954
-Peggy, you really saved me.
-lt was no problem.

38
00:02:00,117 --> 00:02:03,109
-Mr. Peterman is gonna love them.
-Thanks, Susie.

39
00:02:16,757 --> 00:02:20,830
You won't believe this,
but as l'm leaving, she calls me Susie.

40
00:02:20,997 --> 00:02:24,194
l don't see you as a Susie.
Sharon, maybe.

41
00:02:24,357 --> 00:02:29,306
What am l, a bulimic, chain-smoking
stenographer from Staten lsland?

42
00:02:29,717 --> 00:02:31,867
-Who are you describing?
-Someone l know.

43
00:02:32,037 --> 00:02:34,153
-Named Sharon?
-l'd rather not say.

44
00:02:34,837 --> 00:02:36,509
Hey.

45
00:02:36,677 --> 00:02:40,431
-What's in the bag?
-New tuxedo for the Pinstripe Ball.

46
00:02:40,597 --> 00:02:43,430
Steinbrenner is throwing
a huge party at Tavern on the Green.

47
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:44,916
Kind of a Yankee prom?

48
00:02:45,597 --> 00:02:48,111
lt's not a prom. lt's a ball.

49
00:02:48,277 --> 00:02:50,632
-You taking Allison?
-Yes, of course l'm taking Allison.

50
00:02:50,797 --> 00:02:53,072
This woman is genetically
engineered to go to a ball.

51
00:02:53,237 --> 00:02:55,432
-Tall, blond, lithe.
-Live?

52
00:02:55,597 --> 00:02:56,746
-Lithe.
-Live?

53
00:02:56,917 --> 00:02:58,908
-Lithe.
-Oh, lithe.

54
00:02:59,317 --> 00:03:02,309
-Well, you two will have a great time.
-lt can't be worse than this.

55
00:03:02,877 --> 00:03:05,994
Wait till you see the dress
that she's got. lt's backless.

56
00:03:06,157 --> 00:03:08,751
l'm finally gonna make
a great entrance.

57
00:03:08,917 --> 00:03:12,227
Backless? You gonna back her in?

58
00:03:13,237 --> 00:03:17,276
Elaine, when a woman makes
a ball entrance, she twirls.

59
00:03:17,437 --> 00:03:19,871
-She's not gonna twi--
-She'll twirl.

60
00:03:21,797 --> 00:03:23,628
That is what Mr. Steinbrenner wants.

61
00:03:23,797 --> 00:03:26,834
He wants everyone to twirl around.

62
00:03:26,997 --> 00:03:28,191
-All right.
-Great.

63
00:03:28,357 --> 00:03:30,666
Hey, did you get your boss's
Knick ticket for Kramer?

64
00:03:30,837 --> 00:03:32,190
-Yeah, here.
-Great.

65
00:03:33,637 --> 00:03:35,946
-Say, George--
-Oh, courtside.

66
00:03:36,117 --> 00:03:37,789
ls that the best you could do?

67
00:03:37,957 --> 00:03:41,347
-George, we need to talk.
-What?

68
00:03:41,517 --> 00:03:43,712
l really think we need to talk.

69
00:03:47,877 --> 00:03:49,629
-She wants to talk?
-She doesn't want to.

70
00:03:49,797 --> 00:03:52,265
-She needs to talk.
-Nobody needs to talk.

71
00:03:52,437 --> 00:03:53,790
Who would want to?

72
00:03:53,957 --> 00:03:56,596
-She tried to end it with me, Jerry.
-What did you do?

73
00:03:56,757 --> 00:04:00,750
l told her l was out of soda. l went out
to get some, and l never went back.

74
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:06,914
-All night?
-Yeah, l slept at my parents' house.

75
00:04:07,357 --> 00:04:10,588
-And she wants to break up with you.
-Can you believe it?

76
00:04:11,597 --> 00:04:14,111
l'm supposed to be having lunch
with her now at Pomodoro.

77
00:04:14,637 --> 00:04:16,673
Everybody breaks up at Pomodoros.

78
00:04:16,837 --> 00:04:19,226
-So, what am l gonna do?
-You really like this girl.

79
00:04:19,397 --> 00:04:21,513
No, l like the ball.

80
00:04:21,677 --> 00:04:23,793
This is my one chance
to make a great entrance.

81
00:04:23,957 --> 00:04:26,425
My whole life, l've never made
a great entrance.

82
00:04:26,597 --> 00:04:28,906
You've made some fine exits.

83
00:04:29,797 --> 00:04:31,549
So, what?
You can't keep avoiding her.

84
00:04:31,717 --> 00:04:32,911
Why not?

85
00:04:33,077 --> 00:04:35,955
lf she can't find me,
she can't break up with me.

86
00:04:36,117 --> 00:04:40,986
And if we're still going out,
she has to go to the ball.

87
00:04:41,837 --> 00:04:44,032
Hey. Oh, listen, did you get
my ticket from Allison?

88
00:04:44,197 --> 00:04:45,391
-Right here.
-All right.

89
00:04:47,477 --> 00:04:49,468
Courtside.

90
00:04:49,637 --> 00:04:51,116
Don't let this girl get away.

91
00:04:52,437 --> 00:04:54,587
She'll have to find me first.

92
00:04:56,877 --> 00:04:58,993
Oh, by the way, you owe Mike $1 00.

93
00:04:59,157 --> 00:05:01,432
-What for?
-l bet for you on tonight's game.

94
00:05:01,597 --> 00:05:06,034
Yeah, if the Knicks beat the Pacers
by more than 35, it pays 1 0-1 .

95
00:05:06,197 --> 00:05:08,233
That's some sweet action.

96
00:05:08,637 --> 00:05:10,593
But l don't want any sweet action.

97
00:05:10,757 --> 00:05:13,476
Well, l couldn't do it.
l got a gambling problem.

98
00:05:13,637 --> 00:05:15,070
So you put down my money?

99
00:05:15,837 --> 00:05:17,714
You don't have a problem.

100
00:05:17,877 --> 00:05:19,913
Not with that, no.

101
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:24,425
Susie.

102
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:27,153
Susie.

103
00:05:29,077 --> 00:05:31,068
Hi, Peggy.

104
00:05:31,237 --> 00:05:32,989
Look, l should have
said this yesterday--

105
00:05:33,157 --> 00:05:35,148
Did you get this memo
from Elaine Benes?

106
00:05:35,317 --> 00:05:38,912
You know, it's amazing
Peterman hasn't fired that dolt.

107
00:05:39,077 --> 00:05:41,307
She practically ran the company
into the ground.

108
00:05:41,477 --> 00:05:44,435
Well, l thought
she did a pretty good job.

109
00:05:44,597 --> 00:05:46,986
l heard she was a disaster, Suz.

110
00:05:47,157 --> 00:05:50,229
Lookit. lt's not Suz, all right?

111
00:05:50,397 --> 00:05:52,547
lt's Susie.

112
00:05:52,717 --> 00:05:56,266
My name is Susie.

113
00:06:03,957 --> 00:06:06,676
Believe it or not
George isn't at home

114
00:06:06,837 --> 00:06:10,512
Please leave a message
At the beep

115
00:06:10,677 --> 00:06:13,350
I must be out
Or I'd pick up the phone

116
00:06:13,997 --> 00:06:16,989
Where could I be?

117
00:06:17,157 --> 00:06:21,469
Believe it or not, I'm not home

118
00:06:21,637 --> 00:06:23,787
Pick up.
l know you're screening for Allison.

119
00:06:24,757 --> 00:06:26,349
-Hey.
-So coffee shop?

120
00:06:26,517 --> 00:06:29,077
No, l can't. She knows l go there.
lt's not secure.

121
00:06:29,237 --> 00:06:32,274
Hey, l got another call coming in.
l gotta let the machine get it. Bye.

122
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:38,110
Believe it or not
George isn't at home

123
00:06:38,277 --> 00:06:41,986
Please leave a message
At the beep

124
00:06:42,157 --> 00:06:45,229
I must be out
Or I'd pick up the phone

125
00:06:45,397 --> 00:06:48,355
Where could I be?

126
00:06:48,517 --> 00:06:52,988
Believe it or not, I'm not home

127
00:06:53,157 --> 00:06:55,751
George, are you there?

128
00:06:56,277 --> 00:06:57,915
I hate that stupid message.

129
00:06:58,077 --> 00:06:59,988
I know you're av oiding me.
I'm at the office.

130
00:07:00,157 --> 00:07:02,910
Please call me.
I've gotta talk to you.

131
00:07:11,877 --> 00:07:13,071
Hi, Allison.

132
00:07:13,237 --> 00:07:15,273
Oh, l guess you're not at home.

133
00:07:15,437 --> 00:07:17,905
l probably should have
tried you at the office.

134
00:07:18,077 --> 00:07:19,874
Anyway, good to hear from you.

135
00:07:20,037 --> 00:07:22,676
Really looking forward to the ball.

136
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:28,596
Can you believe this woman?

137
00:07:28,757 --> 00:07:32,909
The nerve. Talking about you behind
your back, and right to your face.

138
00:07:33,557 --> 00:07:35,787
No. Suz.

139
00:07:35,957 --> 00:07:40,155
l mean, Susie,
Suzanne, Susanna. Fine.

140
00:07:40,317 --> 00:07:44,276
But there is no way
l'm gonna be a Suz.

141
00:07:44,437 --> 00:07:45,711
No. No Suz.

142
00:07:45,877 --> 00:07:49,631
l mean, what am l? Some pom-pom
waving, back-seat bimbo?

143
00:07:49,797 --> 00:07:51,310
-Who are you describing?
-Someone.

144
00:07:51,477 --> 00:07:53,308
-Named Suz?
-No, still Sharon.

145
00:07:54,317 --> 00:07:56,308
-Hey.
-Hey, l thought you went to the game.

146
00:07:56,477 --> 00:07:59,150
No, l was kicked out for fighting
with one of the players.

147
00:07:59,317 --> 00:08:02,115
-Wait. Wait. Wait. Who?
-Reggie Miller.

148
00:08:02,277 --> 00:08:03,790
-Cheryl Miller's brother?
-Yeah.

149
00:08:03,957 --> 00:08:07,108
Hey, hey, hey. Wait. Wait. Wait.
What happened?

150
00:08:07,277 --> 00:08:11,395
Well, first of all, for some reason,
they started the game an hour late.

151
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:13,707
And, l don't know,
l was sitting next to Spike Lee.

152
00:08:13,877 --> 00:08:16,345
He and Reggie were jawing
at each other. l got involved.

153
00:08:16,517 --> 00:08:19,714
Wait. Wait. Wait.
What do you mean, '' involved''?

154
00:08:19,877 --> 00:08:24,029
Well, l ran out onto the court
and threw a hot dog at Reggie Miller.

155
00:08:24,197 --> 00:08:25,915
lnvolved.

156
00:08:26,077 --> 00:08:28,511
Then they threw me and Reggie
and Spike out of the game.

157
00:08:29,077 --> 00:08:30,271
So that's it?

158
00:08:30,437 --> 00:08:33,554
Well, you know, l felt pretty bad
about everything.

159
00:08:33,717 --> 00:08:35,469
Then the three of us
went to a strip club.

160
00:08:38,837 --> 00:08:40,111
Can you believe that?

161
00:08:40,277 --> 00:08:43,906
l didn't know Cheryl Miller's
little brother played basketball.

162
00:08:44,077 --> 00:08:45,954
Knicks killed them, 1 1 0-7 3.

163
00:08:46,117 --> 00:08:48,108
Well, without Reggie Miller,
it's a blowout.

164
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:49,710
No, Jerry, that's 37 points.

165
00:08:49,877 --> 00:08:51,310
The Knicks covered. You won.

166
00:08:51,477 --> 00:08:55,550
See, that's a cool G, daddy-o.
Now, you gotta let it ride.

167
00:08:56,277 --> 00:08:58,666
-On what?
-Jerry, l don't wanna lose this feeling.

168
00:08:58,837 --> 00:09:00,873
Let's go to the OTB,
put money on the ponies.

169
00:09:01,037 --> 00:09:02,629
Yeah, all right.

170
00:09:02,797 --> 00:09:06,028
-They just closed.
-Oh, too bad.

171
00:09:07,717 --> 00:09:09,469
Mr. Peterman,
you wanted to see me?

172
00:09:09,957 --> 00:09:12,266
Apparently Peggy down in Design...

173
00:09:12,437 --> 00:09:16,669
...got into a little bit of a tiff yesterday
with somebody named Susie.

174
00:09:17,437 --> 00:09:19,109
-Susie.
-Yes.

175
00:09:19,277 --> 00:09:23,156
And between you, me and
the lamppost, and the desk...

176
00:09:23,317 --> 00:09:26,036
...Peggy says this Suz
isn't much of a worker.

177
00:09:26,557 --> 00:09:28,195
lt's Susie.

178
00:09:28,357 --> 00:09:32,111
Nevertheless, Elaine,
the house of Peterman is in disorder.

179
00:09:32,277 --> 00:09:35,189
First thing tomorrow morning,
l wanna see you, Peggy and Susie...

180
00:09:35,357 --> 00:09:37,075
...right here in my office.

181
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:41,150
All of us?

182
00:09:45,917 --> 00:09:47,111
Allison, hi.

183
00:09:47,277 --> 00:09:50,075
Listen, l'm sorry about what happened
at the game last night.

184
00:09:50,237 --> 00:09:51,636
Could l have that ticket tonight?

185
00:09:51,797 --> 00:09:53,992
The Rockets are in town
and that Hakeem Olajuwon...

186
00:09:54,157 --> 00:09:56,034
...he's got a real attitude.

187
00:09:56,877 --> 00:09:58,833
Kramer, have you seen
George around?

188
00:09:58,997 --> 00:10:01,147
-l can't get ahold of him.
-Oh, yeah. Yeah.

189
00:10:01,317 --> 00:10:04,389
Well, he visits the guy across the hall
from me like every 1 0 minutes.

190
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:08,469
Believe it or not
George isn't at home

191
00:10:08,637 --> 00:10:10,275
Hey, Jerry.

192
00:10:10,437 --> 00:10:12,348
Hey, Mike.
How about those Knicks?

193
00:10:12,517 --> 00:10:14,235
How about them?

194
00:10:14,397 --> 00:10:17,036
-Look, Jerry, l can't pay you.
-Why not?

195
00:10:17,197 --> 00:10:20,428
-Because l don't have the money.
-Mike, you say you're a bookie...

196
00:10:20,597 --> 00:10:22,508
...you take a bet
and then you can't pay.

197
00:10:22,677 --> 00:10:26,511
l don't know, Mike, to me it sounds
a little, how you say, phoney.

198
00:10:26,677 --> 00:10:29,316
Just give me till Friday.
Please, please?

199
00:10:29,477 --> 00:10:31,547
You know, you're supposed
to be the bookie.

200
00:10:31,717 --> 00:10:34,629
-Act like one.
-l'm sorry.

201
00:10:34,797 --> 00:10:37,152
Here, let me give you
a hand with that.

202
00:10:37,317 --> 00:10:41,196
-There's something wrong this trunk.
-Oh, let me see.

203
00:10:45,197 --> 00:10:47,153
So, Kramer,
why'd you ask me out to dinner?

204
00:10:47,677 --> 00:10:49,110
And why Pomodoro?

205
00:10:49,277 --> 00:10:52,030
How could you say that to me?

206
00:10:52,197 --> 00:10:56,076
Allison spoke to me
and she wanted me to speak to you.

207
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:01,229
Now, we all know
that this relationship isn't working.

208
00:11:01,397 --> 00:11:06,027
So Allison and l think that the best
thing to do is just make a clean break.

209
00:11:06,197 --> 00:11:07,789
Can't we discuss this?

210
00:11:07,957 --> 00:11:11,552
We just don't think you're ready
for a serious relationship.

211
00:11:12,117 --> 00:11:14,267
l didn't even know
you wanted to get serious.

212
00:11:14,437 --> 00:11:16,507
So, what am l in this for?

213
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:22,153
You know, l'm getting to a point in
my life where l need something more...

214
00:11:22,317 --> 00:11:24,512
...than just a good time.

215
00:11:26,157 --> 00:11:27,875
-Are you?
-What, me?

216
00:11:28,037 --> 00:11:29,356
No, no.

217
00:11:29,517 --> 00:11:30,745
But she is.

218
00:11:31,717 --> 00:11:33,514
l can't believe this is happening.

219
00:11:33,677 --> 00:11:36,271
George, we're sorry.

220
00:11:36,437 --> 00:11:37,631
We're through.

221
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,469
Kramer, please.

222
00:11:40,757 --> 00:11:42,827
l'm sorry.

223
00:11:47,477 --> 00:11:49,149
Mr. Peterman, Peggy.

224
00:11:50,557 --> 00:11:52,309
l guess we should
just get this over with.

225
00:11:52,477 --> 00:11:54,274
Just hold on a minute.

226
00:11:54,437 --> 00:11:56,109
We're still one short.

227
00:11:57,837 --> 00:11:58,986
No, we're not.

228
00:11:59,157 --> 00:12:01,352
Susie has been very rude to me.

229
00:12:01,997 --> 00:12:05,194
Well, Elaine has nothing
but good things to say about Susie.

230
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:07,427
Look.

231
00:12:07,597 --> 00:12:13,388
We don't have to name names
or point fingers...

232
00:12:13,557 --> 00:12:15,832
...or name names.

233
00:12:16,597 --> 00:12:21,910
Me and her have had our problems.
She and l have had our problems.

234
00:12:22,077 --> 00:12:24,591
You and l and she and you.

235
00:12:24,757 --> 00:12:27,271
Don't you drag me into this.

236
00:12:27,437 --> 00:12:29,553
This is between you
and her and her.

237
00:12:29,717 --> 00:12:34,313
Yes. And l am convinced
that if she were here with us today...

238
00:12:34,477 --> 00:12:36,752
...she would agree with me too.

239
00:12:37,077 --> 00:12:39,796
-Who?
-Her.

240
00:12:39,957 --> 00:12:43,267
-Where is she?
-This is part of the problem.

241
00:12:43,437 --> 00:12:45,632
l thought l was part of this problem.

242
00:12:45,797 --> 00:12:48,265
You're a huge part of the problem.

243
00:12:48,837 --> 00:12:52,034
But l think that at its core...

244
00:12:52,197 --> 00:12:54,916
...this is a Susie-and-Elaine problem...

245
00:12:55,077 --> 00:12:58,831
...that requires
a Susie-and-Elaine solution.

246
00:12:58,997 --> 00:13:01,875
And who better to do that than...

247
00:13:02,997 --> 00:13:06,512
...Elaine and Susie,
Susie and Elaine.

248
00:13:08,117 --> 00:13:10,836
Well, now that we have
that cleared up...

249
00:13:10,997 --> 00:13:13,067
...why don't the three of us
have lunch?

250
00:13:13,637 --> 00:13:15,150
What?

251
00:13:16,197 --> 00:13:18,028
Oh, l'm coming.

252
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:20,267
l gotta go.

253
00:13:21,157 --> 00:13:24,194
She is the best.

254
00:13:25,477 --> 00:13:26,671
What was your name again?

255
00:13:29,917 --> 00:13:31,475
Mike's outside. He wants to talk.

256
00:13:31,637 --> 00:13:33,116
Then why doesn't he just come in?

257
00:13:33,277 --> 00:13:36,428
-Because he's scared, Jerry.
-Why is he scared?

258
00:13:38,677 --> 00:13:40,508
Come on, Mike.

259
00:13:41,157 --> 00:13:42,988
-Did you do this?
-Yeah, but--

260
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:46,346
-You broke his thumbs.
-lt was an accident.

261
00:13:46,517 --> 00:13:50,510
ls that what you call it
when somebody doesn't pay up?

262
00:13:50,677 --> 00:13:54,033
l'll get the money. l got a hundred
in my pocket if you wanna reach in.

263
00:13:54,197 --> 00:13:55,755
l don't want it that way.

264
00:13:55,917 --> 00:13:59,353
Okay, how about Mike fixes your trunk,
we call it even, nobody has to get hurt.

265
00:13:59,517 --> 00:14:01,712
-Fine.
-Thank you, Jerry. Thank you.

266
00:14:01,877 --> 00:14:05,472
l won't forget this. l'm gonna
fix your trunk good. Real good.

267
00:14:08,277 --> 00:14:10,347
See, that was nice, Jerry.

268
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,189
Oh, by the way, l broke your trunk.

269
00:14:12,357 --> 00:14:13,710
lt's just a car.

270
00:14:25,317 --> 00:14:27,387
-Hi.
-Hi.

271
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:34,554
-lt's funny running into you here.
-Yeah. Yeah.

272
00:14:34,717 --> 00:14:35,945
lt's funny.

273
00:14:38,197 --> 00:14:39,391
You look good.

274
00:14:43,597 --> 00:14:46,555
Do l? Thanks.

275
00:14:46,717 --> 00:14:49,106
-You too.
-Oh, yeah.

276
00:14:53,397 --> 00:14:55,627
lt's getting kind of late.
l really have to be going.

277
00:14:55,797 --> 00:14:57,469
-Yeah.
-So it's nice seeing you again.

278
00:14:57,637 --> 00:15:00,356
Hey, you know,
maybe l'll call you sometime.

279
00:15:00,517 --> 00:15:03,111
George, it's over. lt's just--

280
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:04,426
lt's over.

281
00:15:09,277 --> 00:15:10,471
What do you think, Jerry?

282
00:15:10,637 --> 00:15:13,390
l don't know,
l just see you guys together.

283
00:15:21,877 --> 00:15:23,151
Stupid thumbs.

284
00:15:32,117 --> 00:15:34,187
Somebody help. Help!

285
00:15:35,317 --> 00:15:36,511
So Peterman bought it?

286
00:15:36,677 --> 00:15:38,872
l can't believe
you got away with that.

287
00:15:39,037 --> 00:15:42,507
Well, l'm very fortunate
to be surrounded by such stupidity.

288
00:15:42,677 --> 00:15:44,110
Yeah, l know how you feel.

289
00:15:44,797 --> 00:15:45,991
Help!

290
00:15:46,997 --> 00:15:49,067
-You hear something?
-What?

291
00:15:49,237 --> 00:15:51,068
Jerry.

292
00:15:51,237 --> 00:15:52,670
Jerry.

293
00:15:52,837 --> 00:15:55,032
Oh, the trunk's broken. lt's rattling.

294
00:15:55,197 --> 00:15:57,631
Jerry, l don't know how much longer
l can keep this up.

295
00:15:57,797 --> 00:16:00,106
They're starting to give Susie
assignments now.

296
00:16:00,277 --> 00:16:02,507
Well, there's only one thing to do.
Eliminate her.

297
00:16:02,677 --> 00:16:03,871
What?

298
00:16:04,037 --> 00:16:05,595
Get rid of Susie.

299
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:07,554
Make her disappear.

300
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:09,947
-But l kind of like her.
-She's gone.

301
00:16:10,117 --> 00:16:11,709
-Jerry.
-Gone.

302
00:16:14,677 --> 00:16:15,826
The bumper sticker.

303
00:16:20,597 --> 00:16:22,588
Oh, God, l'm in trouble.

304
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,706
Kramer, open up.
l know you're in there.

305
00:16:29,717 --> 00:16:30,911
George?

306
00:16:31,077 --> 00:16:33,716
Come on. lt's 5:00 in the morning.
What's the matter with you?

307
00:16:33,877 --> 00:16:35,754
lt's only 4.

308
00:16:35,917 --> 00:16:38,590
l've been walking around all night.

309
00:16:38,757 --> 00:16:42,193
l've been thinking about Allison
and me and you.

310
00:16:43,397 --> 00:16:44,750
Come on, George.

311
00:16:44,917 --> 00:16:47,306
Please, give me another chance.

312
00:16:49,477 --> 00:16:52,116
l know l'm gonna regret this.

313
00:16:52,997 --> 00:16:54,191
All right.

314
00:16:54,997 --> 00:16:56,555
Thank you.

315
00:16:56,717 --> 00:16:59,789
-l'm gonna make you both so happy.
-Okay. All right. l'll see you later.

316
00:17:03,837 --> 00:17:05,316
Elaine, where's Susie?

317
00:17:05,477 --> 00:17:08,708
l want her to head up our new
fingerless-glove division.

318
00:17:08,877 --> 00:17:10,833
l thought l was in line
for that assignment.

319
00:17:11,917 --> 00:17:13,350
No.

320
00:17:14,717 --> 00:17:17,550
All right, then, l was gonna wait
to tell you this...

321
00:17:19,037 --> 00:17:21,426
...but last night, Susie....

322
00:17:22,557 --> 00:17:24,752
She took her own life.

323
00:17:33,997 --> 00:17:35,555
-We're taking George back.
-What?

324
00:17:35,717 --> 00:17:37,469
He's gonna make us very happy.

325
00:17:40,277 --> 00:17:42,154
Look at this turnout.

326
00:17:42,317 --> 00:17:45,673
Where did Susie find the time
to meet all these people?

327
00:17:45,837 --> 00:17:49,147
My real funeral's
not gonna come close to this.

328
00:17:50,197 --> 00:17:52,313
Oh, my God.

329
00:17:52,477 --> 00:17:54,513
Susie?

330
00:17:54,677 --> 00:17:56,986
l'm not Susie. l'm Elaine.

331
00:17:57,157 --> 00:18:02,185
-But l've been calling you Susie.
-Hadn't noticed. Excuse me.

332
00:18:05,397 --> 00:18:07,149
l guess l never met Susie.

333
00:18:07,317 --> 00:18:08,955
Suz?

334
00:18:09,557 --> 00:18:11,991
l actually had a little thing
with her for a while.

335
00:18:13,837 --> 00:18:15,429
Her too.

336
00:18:19,597 --> 00:18:23,431
What can you say
about a girl like Susie?

337
00:19:02,237 --> 00:19:04,034
Hey.

338
00:19:05,157 --> 00:19:07,625
-Where's Allison?
-No, Allison, she didn't wanna come.

339
00:19:07,797 --> 00:19:09,071
But you took me back.

340
00:19:09,237 --> 00:19:12,354
Well, yeah, l did,
but she's a tough nut.

341
00:19:12,517 --> 00:19:13,791
How do you like the tuxedo?

342
00:19:13,957 --> 00:19:16,027
lt's a rental,
but l've had it for 1 5 years.

343
00:19:17,717 --> 00:19:19,947
-All right.
-Where are you going?

344
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,516
The ball, silly.

345
00:19:21,677 --> 00:19:24,066
No, no, no.
You're not going in there.

346
00:19:24,437 --> 00:19:26,997
George, l thought
you were gonna change.

347
00:19:27,357 --> 00:19:29,393
For her, not for you.

348
00:19:29,917 --> 00:19:32,590
Let's just try and have
a nice time for once.

349
00:19:32,757 --> 00:19:34,349
We'll talk about this
when we get home.

350
00:19:34,517 --> 00:19:40,035
All right, look. Wait. Wait. Kramer.
Wait a minute. You are not going in.

351
00:19:45,237 --> 00:19:47,068
What an entrance.

352
00:19:47,917 --> 00:19:52,195
-And who might this be?
-Oh, l'm with him. Yeah.

353
00:19:54,237 --> 00:20:00,426
And also much like me,
Susie hated going to the market.

354
00:20:00,597 --> 00:20:06,467
-Elaine, may l say a few words?
-Oh, God, yes, Mr. Peterman.

355
00:20:08,557 --> 00:20:11,594
l don't think l'll ever
be able to forget Susie.

356
00:20:12,437 --> 00:20:14,997
And most of all,
l will never forget that one night...

357
00:20:15,157 --> 00:20:17,113
...working late on the catalogue...

358
00:20:17,277 --> 00:20:21,555
...just the two of us,
and we surrendered to temptation.

359
00:20:23,157 --> 00:20:25,546
And it was pretty good.

360
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:29,236
Yeah, but he didn't sleep
with both of them.

361
00:20:34,957 --> 00:20:38,745
But l never heard her cries for help...

362
00:20:38,917 --> 00:20:42,193
...and now Susie is gone.

363
00:20:42,357 --> 00:20:43,756
Hold on!

364
00:20:44,317 --> 00:20:46,467
Susie didn't commit suicide.

365
00:20:47,157 --> 00:20:49,193
She was murdered...

366
00:20:49,357 --> 00:20:51,632
...by Jerry Seinfeld!

367
00:20:53,677 --> 00:20:56,066
Not only that, l broke his thumbs.

368
00:21:07,237 --> 00:21:08,750
Elaine, guess what.

369
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:13,390
l've decided to form a charitable
foundation in Susie's honour...

370
00:21:13,557 --> 00:21:16,435
...and as Susie's best friend,
l want you to be involved.

371
00:21:16,877 --> 00:21:19,186
Mr. Peterman...

372
00:21:20,037 --> 00:21:22,187
...l'm Susie.

373
00:21:22,357 --> 00:21:23,949
She's me.

374
00:21:25,477 --> 00:21:28,275
l feel the same way.

375
00:21:29,677 --> 00:21:32,589
And that's why this foundation
will meet around your schedule.

376
00:21:32,757 --> 00:21:37,387
Nights, weekends,
every free moment you have.

377
00:21:40,597 --> 00:21:46,832
Suz!
