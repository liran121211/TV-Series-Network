1
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:06,257
A dollar eighty-nine.
Why is this $1.89?

2
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:08,375
Why is there no
haggling in this country?

3
00:00:08,539 --> 00:00:11,531
We like to think we've progressed
beyond a knife fight for a drink.

4
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:14,293
Not me.
Everything should be negotiable.

5
00:00:14,459 --> 00:00:16,336
-Restaurants too?
-Absolutely.

6
00:00:16,499 --> 00:00:19,377
Are you telling me there is
no room to move on pasta?

7
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:21,336
All starches are a scam.

8
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:23,895
Yeah, especially ziti,
with that big hole.

9
00:00:25,339 --> 00:00:26,692
Excuse me. How much is this?

10
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:28,975
-A dollar nineteen.
-l'll give you a quarter.

11
00:00:29,139 --> 00:00:30,618
Get the hell out of here.

12
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:33,247
-Tell him 40 and no fork.
-Thirty.

13
00:00:33,419 --> 00:00:35,649
That's it. You leave
and never come back.

14
00:00:35,819 --> 00:00:37,889
How about we leave
and come back in a week?

15
00:00:38,059 --> 00:00:39,333
Deal.

16
00:00:40,059 --> 00:00:42,857
All right. See?
We got something there.

17
00:00:47,139 --> 00:00:48,413
Oh, check it out.

18
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:51,573
Kenny Rogers Roasters
finally opened.

19
00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:55,049
Hey, look at the size of
that neon chicken on the roof.

20
00:00:55,219 --> 00:00:56,857
Rogers can't sell chicken around here.

21
00:00:57,019 --> 00:00:58,691
We got chicken places
on every block.

22
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,975
He is The Gambler.

23
00:01:01,419 --> 00:01:05,298
Well, l gotta meet Newman at the pet
store. l'm helping him pick out a turtle.

24
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:08,218
-Try and stay calm.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:11,096
-Hey. Jerry?
-Seth.

26
00:01:11,259 --> 00:01:13,329
Wow, what has it been,
like, five years?

27
00:01:13,499 --> 00:01:15,410
-At least.
-You want to grab lunch?

28
00:01:15,899 --> 00:01:17,651
l'm actually
headed back to the office.

29
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:19,332
Seth, it's me.

30
00:01:19,499 --> 00:01:22,297
What's more important than catching
up with an old college buddy?

31
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:24,848
Well, l am supposed
to be in this meeting.

32
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:29,570
Blow it off. Remember Poli-Sci?
How many of those did we go to?

33
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:33,011
-All right, l guess l can go.
-All right. All right.

34
00:01:33,179 --> 00:01:35,215
-Hey, whatever happened to Moochy?
-He's dead.

35
00:01:35,379 --> 00:01:36,812
ls that right?

36
00:01:37,339 --> 00:01:40,217
Still don't know how you can call lunch
with me a business expense.

37
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:42,290
-What do you think of the catalogue?
-Stinks.

38
00:01:42,459 --> 00:01:43,972
There, we just talked business.

39
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:47,568
We have the down comforter
and the cookware you liked.

40
00:01:47,739 --> 00:01:50,299
Great. Put it on the Peterman
account with the other stuff.

41
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:52,051
You know what we have
you might like?

42
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:53,937
l'll take it.

43
00:01:54,099 --> 00:01:56,374
Hey, you like?

44
00:01:57,979 --> 00:01:59,890
l think it looks very nice on you.

45
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,297
Really?

46
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:05,497
Elaine?

47
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:08,209
-The Peterman account?
-Why not?

48
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:10,939
And some hair
for my little friend here.

49
00:02:11,779 --> 00:02:13,371
So how's your stand-up career?

50
00:02:13,539 --> 00:02:16,178
Good. As a matter of fact,
l almost had my own show in Japan.

51
00:02:16,339 --> 00:02:18,091
-You speak Japanese?
-No.

52
00:02:18,259 --> 00:02:21,331
So you would have done it in
Japan, but in English?

53
00:02:23,139 --> 00:02:24,970
l don't know.

54
00:02:26,899 --> 00:02:28,218
So, what's this job of yours?

55
00:02:28,699 --> 00:02:32,374
Big investment firm.
We just got the Citibank account.

56
00:02:32,539 --> 00:02:35,531
ln fact, today was our
first big meeting with them.

57
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:38,256
The meeting you blew off?

58
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:40,216
Yeah.

59
00:02:41,499 --> 00:02:43,615
Wasn't that kind of important?

60
00:02:45,179 --> 00:02:46,851
Yeah.

61
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:52,535
And l bought a whole new set
of cookware and a water pick.

62
00:02:52,699 --> 00:02:55,133
-You use a water pick?
-Sure. Water pick...

63
00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:57,415
...floss, Plax, brush, Listerine.

64
00:02:57,579 --> 00:03:00,047
So you go into the bathroom 1 1 ,
you're in bed by what, 2?

65
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:04,007
At the latest. Oh, hang on a second.
l've got another call.

66
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:06,851
-Hello?
-Good day, Miss Benes...

67
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:08,372
...it's Roger lpswich.

68
00:03:08,539 --> 00:03:10,575
Oh, hey, how are things
doing in accounting?

69
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:13,811
Miss Benes, l notice you've been
charging quite a bit of merchandise...

70
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:15,298
...on the Peterman account.

71
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:17,654
Well, l am the president.

72
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:21,528
Yes, and we're all very impressed.

73
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:25,692
Nevertheless, the expense account
is for business purposes only.

74
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:30,338
Well-- Well, isn't the president
allowed to do anything that they want?

75
00:03:30,499 --> 00:03:32,012
No.

76
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:37,171
l'll be in your office
first thing tomorrow. Good day.

77
00:03:37,339 --> 00:03:39,250
Good day.

78
00:03:44,899 --> 00:03:46,537
Hello?

79
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:49,930
Anybody?

80
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:56,373
Hey.

81
00:03:56,539 --> 00:04:00,214
Hey. Why didn't you
get the big one?

82
00:04:01,059 --> 00:04:03,698
This hat just bottles in the heat.
l don't even need a coat.

83
00:04:03,859 --> 00:04:05,178
lt's unbelievable.

84
00:04:05,339 --> 00:04:08,217
-l don't believe it.
-And l got a date with the saleswoman.

85
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:11,007
She got a little Marisa Tomei
thing going on.

86
00:04:11,179 --> 00:04:14,376
Too bad you've got a little
George Costanza thing going on.

87
00:04:14,539 --> 00:04:17,007
l'm going out with her tomorrow.
She had errands to run.

88
00:04:17,179 --> 00:04:18,612
That's a date?

89
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:21,134
What's the difference?
You know the way l work.

90
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:22,937
l'm like a commercial jingle.

91
00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:26,933
First, it's a little irritating. You hear it
a few times. You hum it in the shower.

92
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:30,296
By the third date, it's ''By Mennen. ''

93
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:33,170
How you make sure
you get to the third date?

94
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:36,217
lf there's any doubt,
l do a leave-behind.

95
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:39,849
Keys, gloves, scarf.
l go back to her place to pick it up...

96
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:42,613
-...date number two.
-That is so old.

97
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:45,293
Why don't you just show up
at her house in a wooden horse?

98
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:50,377
By Mennen

99
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:53,011
What the--?

100
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:05,973
What's going on in there?

101
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,050
-What?
-That light.

102
00:05:08,219 --> 00:05:09,891
Oh, the red.

103
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:13,972
Yeah, it's the chicken roaster sign.
lt's right across from my window.

104
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:15,492
Can't you shut the shades?

105
00:05:15,659 --> 00:05:17,650
They are shut.

106
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:19,696
By the way, your friend Seth,
he stopped by.

107
00:05:19,859 --> 00:05:21,815
-Yeah? What'd he have to say?
-He was fired.

108
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:26,768
As you can see, the comforter
l expensed is actually...

109
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:30,090
...the Aristotle goose down tunic.

110
00:05:30,499 --> 00:05:33,377
-What do you think?
-Another bull's-eye.

111
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:36,053
Well, Mr. lpswich,
since every one of my expenses...

112
00:05:36,219 --> 00:05:40,849
...was obviously
for a legitimate business purpose--

113
00:05:41,019 --> 00:05:44,056
l just need to see the
sable hat you purchased yesterday.

114
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,255
The hat? Why do you need to
see the hat?

115
00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:48,330
lt cost $8000.

116
00:05:48,499 --> 00:05:49,978
What?

117
00:05:53,739 --> 00:05:57,129
Seth, if you knew the meeting was so
important, why did you go to lunch?

118
00:05:57,299 --> 00:05:58,618
We're old college buddies.

119
00:05:58,779 --> 00:06:00,770
l only knew you through Moochy.

120
00:06:01,459 --> 00:06:03,529
Hey, Jerry, don't worry about it,
all right?

121
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:06,896
The important thing is,
is we got a chance to catch up.

122
00:06:07,059 --> 00:06:09,573
Mind if l grab the want ads?

123
00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:12,652
Actually, l haven't read
Tank McNamara yet.

124
00:06:18,219 --> 00:06:20,528
How's life on the red planet?

125
00:06:21,659 --> 00:06:24,810
lt's killing me.
l can't eat. l can't sleep.

126
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:29,131
All l can see is that giant red sun
in the shape of a chicken.

127
00:06:29,659 --> 00:06:32,048
Well, did you go down to the
Kenny Rogers and complain?

128
00:06:32,219 --> 00:06:33,811
Oh, they gave me the heave-ho.

129
00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:38,132
l don't think that Kenny Rogers has
any idea what's going on down there.

130
00:06:38,299 --> 00:06:39,891
What are you doing?

131
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:44,047
-Getting some cereal.
-That's tomato juice.

132
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,451
That looked like milk to me.

133
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:55,696
Jerry, my rods
and cones are all screwed up.

134
00:06:56,139 --> 00:06:57,731
All right, that's it.

135
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:00,129
l gotta move in with you, Jerry.

136
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:04,370
l don't know, Kramer.

137
00:07:04,739 --> 00:07:07,412
My concern is that...

138
00:07:07,579 --> 00:07:10,537
...living together after a while we...

139
00:07:11,619 --> 00:07:15,089
...might start to get on
each other's nerves a little.

140
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:18,174
Listen, l got an idea.
You're a heavy sleeper, right?

141
00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:19,692
Why don't we switch apartments?

142
00:07:19,859 --> 00:07:21,975
Or l could sleep in the park.

143
00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:26,773
You can knock these walls down,
make it an eight-room luxury suite.

144
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:31,410
Jerry, these are load bearing walls.
They're not gonna come down.

145
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:33,737
Yeah, that's no good.

146
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:36,049
l may have to drive that place
out of business.

147
00:07:36,219 --> 00:07:39,211
-Well, how are you going to do that?
-Like we did in the '60s.

148
00:07:39,379 --> 00:07:41,370
Taking it to the streets.

149
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:50,692
-Thanks, George, but l got it from here.
-Oh, no, l'm in already. Come on.

150
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:55,576
So you wanna
get together tomorrow?

151
00:07:55,739 --> 00:07:57,650
No, l'm gonna be pretty busy.

152
00:07:58,179 --> 00:08:02,058
-What about this weekend?
-l'm gonna be busy for a while.

153
00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:04,939
Okay. See you.

154
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:07,659
Hey, you forgot your keys.

155
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:10,458
-Those aren't my keys.
-Well, they're not mine.

156
00:08:14,299 --> 00:08:17,609
They are my keys. How weird.

157
00:08:18,379 --> 00:08:20,688
-Goodbye, George.
-Yeah, bye.

158
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:23,212
George, bye.

159
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:30,009
Hello? You are not gonna
believe the date l just had.

160
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:33,813
Costanza

161
00:08:35,859 --> 00:08:37,656
What do you mean,
you don't have the hat?

162
00:08:37,819 --> 00:08:39,571
l left it at Heather's. Are these alive?

163
00:08:39,739 --> 00:08:41,730
No, dead.

164
00:08:42,259 --> 00:08:44,454
George, l need
that Russian hat back.

165
00:08:44,619 --> 00:08:46,530
All right, all right. l'll call Heather.

166
00:08:46,699 --> 00:08:49,896
You'll get your hat back.
l will get a second date.

167
00:08:50,059 --> 00:08:52,698
Now, watch the magic.

168
00:08:54,579 --> 00:08:56,535
Dial nine, Merlin.

169
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:04,814
-Hello?
-Heather, hi, it's George Costanza.

170
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:09,018
Listen, l don't mean
to bother you, but silly me...

171
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:12,535
...l-- l think l may have left my hat
in your apartment, so l thought...

172
00:09:12,699 --> 00:09:16,009
-...l'd just come by later and pick it up.
-You didn't leave a hat here.

173
00:09:16,179 --> 00:09:21,094
l'm pretty sure l left it behind the
cushion of the chair, accidentally.

174
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:23,295
No hat. George, I've gotta go.

175
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:27,054
You know what,
maybe l'll just come-- Hey, hey.

176
00:09:32,699 --> 00:09:36,533
-Seth?
-Jerry, hi. What do you think?

177
00:09:36,699 --> 00:09:39,338
l think you're taking the trash
out for this chicken place...

178
00:09:39,499 --> 00:09:42,855
-...but that couldn't be.
-Yeah, l'm the new manager.

179
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:45,658
But you were an executive.
This is fast food.

180
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:48,208
Not fast food. Good food quickly.

181
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,688
Hey, next time lunch
will be on me, huh, Jer?

182
00:09:50,859 --> 00:09:52,212
Hey!

183
00:09:52,579 --> 00:09:55,377
Stay away from the chicken!
lt's bad!

184
00:09:55,539 --> 00:09:58,053
Bad chicken! Mess you up!

185
00:09:58,219 --> 00:10:00,779
That's not going to be
good for business.

186
00:10:00,939 --> 00:10:03,328
That's not gonna be
good for anybody.

187
00:10:08,939 --> 00:10:11,692
l'm so glad we switched apartments.
lt was the perfect solution.

188
00:10:11,859 --> 00:10:15,898
Kramer, if l'm gonna live over there,
you gotta take some of this stuff out.

189
00:10:16,059 --> 00:10:18,573
l mean, this thing
is really freaking me out.

190
00:10:18,739 --> 00:10:22,129
l feel like it's gonna come to life
in the middle of the night and kill me.

191
00:10:22,419 --> 00:10:24,853
What, Mr. Marbles? He's harmless.

192
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:29,297
And one other thing, l don't want
Newman using my--

193
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:31,017
Oh, no.

194
00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:33,177
-Nice place you got here, Kramer.
-Yeah.

195
00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:36,536
A man could really
get some thinking done.

196
00:10:38,619 --> 00:10:41,258
Don't get too comfortable.
As soon as Seth gets a real job...

197
00:10:41,419 --> 00:10:44,377
...you two are going back in that
chicken supernova.

198
00:10:45,659 --> 00:10:48,537
What's that, Rogers chicken?
Oh, get that out of here.

199
00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:51,577
l don't know. The man makes
a pretty strong bird.

200
00:10:51,739 --> 00:10:53,650
Yeah, but l'm boycotting.

201
00:11:07,419 --> 00:11:09,011
-What is that, hickory?
-Yeah.

202
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,569
lt's the wood that makes it good.

203
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:13,812
Really?

204
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:17,810
Stop it. What's the matter with you?

205
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:26,049
-Can l help you?
-Hi, yeah, l'm Elaine Benes.

206
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:30,656
We met at Barney's.
l'm a friend of George Costanza's.

207
00:11:30,859 --> 00:11:32,338
Hi.

208
00:11:32,499 --> 00:11:36,538
Whether you're aware of it or not,
George had this pathetic little plan...

209
00:11:36,699 --> 00:11:40,851
...to leave something behind so he
could try and weasel a second date.

210
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:42,611
-Really?
-l know.

211
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:44,815
He-- He has a real
confidence problem.

212
00:11:44,979 --> 00:11:47,129
-Well, not really--
-George.

213
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:51,489
l know you told him
that you didn't have the hat...

214
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:55,368
...because you didn't want to see
him again, and more sympathetic...

215
00:11:55,539 --> 00:11:57,291
...l could not be...

216
00:11:58,419 --> 00:12:01,331
...but l really do need
to have the hat back.

217
00:12:01,499 --> 00:12:04,138
Look. l don't know what to tell you,
but there's no hat here.

218
00:12:04,299 --> 00:12:06,938
l mean, maybe the maid took it.
l had people over but--

219
00:12:07,099 --> 00:12:08,248
Well, that makes sense.

220
00:12:08,419 --> 00:12:11,377
Well, then you wouldn't mind
if we took a second look around?

221
00:12:11,819 --> 00:12:13,298
Be my guest.

222
00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:15,131
Good to see you again.

223
00:12:19,979 --> 00:12:23,210
She's bluffing. She's got it
stashed away in there somewhere.

224
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:26,177
This is an absolute disaster.

225
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:29,092
Oh, l don't know. Check this out.

226
00:12:34,619 --> 00:12:36,894
You stole her clock?

227
00:12:40,539 --> 00:12:42,257
Well done.

228
00:12:42,619 --> 00:12:45,975
Yep. This is one for our side.

229
00:13:03,619 --> 00:13:05,496
What is that creaking?

230
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:08,378
It's lik e I'm in the hold of a ship.

231
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:10,495
I've gotta relax.

232
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:17,577
Hello?

233
00:13:18,419 --> 00:13:20,933
ls somebody there?

234
00:13:21,099 --> 00:13:23,249
Mr. Marbles?

235
00:13:26,219 --> 00:13:29,291
So l told lpswich l'd have
the hat by this afternoon.

236
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:32,849
-What am l going to do?
-You should sleep with him.

237
00:13:38,619 --> 00:13:40,211
Hi, buddy.

238
00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:43,727
l'm on no sleep, no sleep.

239
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:46,857
You don't know what it's like.
Things are creaking and cracking...

240
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:49,613
...and that red light
is burning my brain.

241
00:13:50,299 --> 00:13:53,496
-You look a little stressed.
-Oh, l'm stressed.

242
00:13:57,019 --> 00:14:00,489
So, Kramer, what am l supposed to do?
lf l don't have that fur hat by 4:00...

243
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:02,854
...they're gonna take me down
like Nixon.

244
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:05,487
You know my friend
Bob Sacamano?

245
00:14:05,659 --> 00:14:07,092
l thought he was Kramer's friend.

246
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:09,819
He called last night about
3 a.m. and we got to talking.

247
00:14:09,979 --> 00:14:13,608
He sells Russian hats
down at Battery Park, 40 bucks.

248
00:14:14,299 --> 00:14:16,449
Forty bucks? Are they sable?

249
00:14:16,619 --> 00:14:18,769
No, but the difference is negligible.

250
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:22,333
Oh, yeah, l like this idea.

251
00:14:23,099 --> 00:14:26,171
-All right. Let's give it a shot. Let's go.
-Giddyup.

252
00:14:29,019 --> 00:14:32,011
-lt's getting cold. lt's getting cold.
-That was a close one.

253
00:14:32,219 --> 00:14:33,618
Why do we keep this from Jerry?

254
00:14:33,819 --> 00:14:38,290
lf Jerry finds out l'm hooked on Rogers
chicken, l'm back with the red menace.

255
00:14:40,539 --> 00:14:43,337
Miss Benes, the hat you charged
to the company was sable.

256
00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:46,129
This is nutria.

257
00:14:47,299 --> 00:14:51,815
Well, that's a-- lt's a kind of sable.

258
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:55,330
No, it's a kind of rat.

259
00:14:56,539 --> 00:14:58,495
That's a rat hat?

260
00:14:58,739 --> 00:15:02,254
And a poorly made one,
even by rat hat standards.

261
00:15:03,619 --> 00:15:05,894
l've no choice but to
recommended your termination...

262
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:08,732
...to the board of directors.
Nothing short of the approval...

263
00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:11,174
...of Peterman himself
will save you this time.

264
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:13,773
But-- But he's in the Burmese jungle.

265
00:15:14,139 --> 00:15:16,050
And quite mad, too, from what l hear.

266
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:19,896
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Can l fire you?

267
00:15:20,539 --> 00:15:22,336
No.

268
00:15:24,459 --> 00:15:26,450
-So Heather called?
-Yeah, but get this.

269
00:15:26,619 --> 00:15:30,328
The message said,
'' Call me if you have the time.''

270
00:15:30,499 --> 00:15:33,172
lf l have the time? You got it?

271
00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:36,217
No, but this is all very exciting.

272
00:15:36,699 --> 00:15:38,610
She knows that l have her clock.

273
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:40,610
l know that she has my hat.

274
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:42,929
l think she's getting ready
to make an exchange.

275
00:15:43,099 --> 00:15:46,774
Well, there is the possibility that
you've gone right out of your mind.

276
00:15:48,379 --> 00:15:50,939
l've looked at that. lt seems unlikely.

277
00:15:51,099 --> 00:15:52,896
Well, l'd look again.

278
00:15:53,059 --> 00:15:55,414
So how come you didn't call
Jerry about all this?

279
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,809
Jerry. l can't talk to Jerry anymore.

280
00:15:57,979 --> 00:16:01,016
Ever since he moved into
that apartment he's too much...

281
00:16:01,179 --> 00:16:02,931
...like you.

282
00:16:03,099 --> 00:16:04,930
That's a shame.

283
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:09,932
Seth, you're the manager.
Can't you turn off that sign?

284
00:16:10,099 --> 00:16:13,569
Jerry, l lied.
l'm just an assistant manager.

285
00:16:14,539 --> 00:16:17,895
Number 67, family feast.

286
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:21,051
Number 67. Right here. Right here.

287
00:16:21,219 --> 00:16:23,892
-Hello, Newman.
-Hello, Jerry.

288
00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:26,050
And don't forget
your steamed broccoli.

289
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:27,493
Hold it.

290
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:30,619
Broccoli? Newman,
you wouldn't eat broccoli...

291
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:33,498
...if it was deep fried
in chocolate sauce.

292
00:16:34,939 --> 00:16:39,490
l love broccoli. lt's good for you.

293
00:16:39,659 --> 00:16:41,251
Really?

294
00:16:41,659 --> 00:16:44,298
Then maybe
you'd like to have a piece.

295
00:16:44,899 --> 00:16:46,730
Gladly.

296
00:16:52,299 --> 00:16:54,290
Vile weed!

297
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:56,611
lt's for Kramer, isn't it? l knew it.

298
00:16:56,779 --> 00:16:58,849
The greasy doorknob.
The licking of the fingers.

299
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:02,056
-He's hooked on the chicken, isn't he?
-Yes! Yes, now, please...

300
00:17:02,219 --> 00:17:03,971
...someone, honey mustard.

301
00:17:16,739 --> 00:17:20,209
Newman, what took you--
Hey, buddy.

302
00:17:20,379 --> 00:17:21,937
-That was good.
-Expecting Newman?

303
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:24,010
That's funny, because
l happened upon him...

304
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:25,851
...down at the
Kenny Rogers Roasters.

305
00:17:26,019 --> 00:17:28,852
Kenny Rogers.
Oh, boy, l hate that place.

306
00:17:29,019 --> 00:17:31,977
He was buying quite a load of chicken,
almost enough for two people.

307
00:17:32,139 --> 00:17:34,414
-As long as one of them is not him.
-Yeah.

308
00:17:34,579 --> 00:17:37,173
Oh, hey, you know,
Elaine, she stopped by.

309
00:17:37,339 --> 00:17:39,773
Yeah, dropped off
that Bob Sacamano hat.

310
00:17:39,939 --> 00:17:42,772
Yeah, oh, she's upset with him.
Yes, sirree.

311
00:17:42,939 --> 00:17:45,089
Yeah, well, thanks for stopping by.

312
00:17:45,499 --> 00:17:47,933
l sure do miss my apartment.

313
00:17:48,099 --> 00:17:50,055
Maybe l'll switch back.

314
00:17:50,219 --> 00:17:51,937
You don't want to think about that.

315
00:17:52,099 --> 00:17:54,852
Otherwise, l'd have no choice
but to put that banner back up...

316
00:17:55,019 --> 00:17:58,136
...and run that Rogers
right out of town.

317
00:17:58,299 --> 00:18:02,417
l don't think you will. Matter of fact l'll
save you the trouble. l'll do it myself.

318
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:04,729
Go ahead. Put the banner up.
Doesn't matter to me.

319
00:18:04,899 --> 00:18:06,617
-All right.
-No, Jerry.

320
00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:08,849
l need that chicken!
l've got to have that ch--

321
00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:12,648
Now, you leave those roasters alone!
Kenny never hurt anybody!

322
00:18:13,579 --> 00:18:16,377
-You got a little problem.
-Oh, l got a big problem, Jerry!

323
00:18:28,419 --> 00:18:30,296
Here. Kneel here.

324
00:18:30,459 --> 00:18:31,608
-What?
-Kneel.

325
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:33,770
Kneel? Okay.

326
00:18:36,379 --> 00:18:37,971
Elaine.

327
00:18:41,619 --> 00:18:43,018
Mr. Peterman.

328
00:18:50,779 --> 00:18:52,132
You speak Burmese?

329
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:54,893
No, Elaine, that was gibberish.

330
00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:00,012
So did you have any
trouble finding the place?

331
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:02,170
No, you're the only...

332
00:19:02,779 --> 00:19:06,294
...white-poet-warlord
in the neighbourhood.

333
00:19:08,019 --> 00:19:09,611
Are you an assassin?

334
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:12,532
l work for your mail order catalogue.

335
00:19:12,699 --> 00:19:17,727
You're an errand girl sent
by grocery clerks to collect a bill.

336
00:19:17,899 --> 00:19:21,972
Well, actually, l do have a bill here.

337
00:19:22,139 --> 00:19:25,973
lf you could just sign this
expense form...

338
00:19:26,139 --> 00:19:28,778
...l think l could still make
the last fan boat out of here.

339
00:19:29,499 --> 00:19:31,569
l'd be happy to, Elaine.

340
00:19:31,739 --> 00:19:33,252
Here you go.

341
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,807
But l will have to see this hat.

342
00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:40,292
Right.

343
00:19:48,459 --> 00:19:49,778
So how do you want to do this?

344
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:52,897
All right, George, l'll be honest.

345
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:55,698
The first time we went out,
l found you very irritating.

346
00:19:55,859 --> 00:19:57,895
But after seeing you
a couple of times...

347
00:19:58,299 --> 00:20:01,018
...you sort of got stuck in my head.

348
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:02,897
Costanza

349
00:20:04,379 --> 00:20:06,449
So you really don't have my hat?

350
00:20:06,619 --> 00:20:08,371
What?

351
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:13,653
Let's go do something.

352
00:20:13,819 --> 00:20:17,607
-What's in the bag?
-Oh, that's-- That's a sandwich.

353
00:20:20,859 --> 00:20:22,087
Damn salami.

354
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:25,930
My clock.

355
00:20:26,619 --> 00:20:28,894
-You stole it?
-That damn delicatessen.

356
00:20:29,059 --> 00:20:32,210
That is the last time they
screw up one of my orders.

357
00:20:37,979 --> 00:20:41,415
Hey, Seth. Man, it is coming
down hard out there.

358
00:20:44,259 --> 00:20:45,977
Oh, gross.

359
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,456
That's not gonna be
good for business.

360
00:20:49,619 --> 00:20:52,053
That's not gonna be
good for anybody.

361
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:02,772
Kenny?

362
00:21:05,699 --> 00:21:07,337
Kenny?

363
00:21:17,139 --> 00:21:18,413
Kenny.

364
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,377
Kenny.

365
00:21:23,739 --> 00:21:25,297
Kenny.

366
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:27,411
Home at last.

367
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:34,858
ls someone there?

368
00:21:37,979 --> 00:21:39,856
Mr. Marbles.

369
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:42,655
This is the urban sombrero.

370
00:21:42,819 --> 00:21:45,128
l put it on the last catalogue cover.

371
00:21:50,899 --> 00:21:52,855
The horror.

372
00:21:53,939 --> 00:21:55,895
The horror.
