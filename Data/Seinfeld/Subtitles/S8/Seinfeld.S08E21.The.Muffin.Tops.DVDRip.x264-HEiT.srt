1
00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:05,366
Hang on, let me just pick up a paper.

2
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:07,363
Excuse me. Would you mind...

3
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:10,407
-...watching my bag for a minute?
-Yeah, no problem.

4
00:00:11,089 --> 00:00:13,398
-Let's go.
-Well, l gotta watch this guy's bag.

5
00:00:14,289 --> 00:00:18,407
-For how long?
-l'm sure he'll be back in a second.

6
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:22,042
-Nice stuff.
-Come on.

7
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:25,883
Excuse me, sir. Would you mind
watching my bag for a second?

8
00:00:26,049 --> 00:00:27,926
Why? So l can stand here
like an idiot...

9
00:00:28,089 --> 00:00:30,159
...not knowing
if you'll ever come back?

10
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:35,399
-Where are you going?
-l'm gonna be this guy's friend.

11
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:43,206
-New clothes?
-Yeah, l did some shopping.

12
00:00:43,369 --> 00:00:45,519
Some new-clothes shopping.

13
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:47,563
Can l borrow your menu?

14
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:49,879
Strange, for new pants
there's noticeable wear...

15
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:51,880
...on the buttocks of those chinos.

16
00:00:52,849 --> 00:00:55,079
Wait, those are the clothes
from the bag.

17
00:00:55,769 --> 00:00:57,043
The guy never came back.

18
00:00:57,209 --> 00:00:59,439
He asked you to watch them,
not wear them.

19
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:01,725
l'm still watching them.

20
00:01:02,849 --> 00:01:05,761
-You look like a tourist.
-All right. Let me ask you something.

21
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:08,688
When do you start to worry
about ear hair?

22
00:01:09,089 --> 00:01:11,762
When you hear, like, a soft rustling.

23
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:14,126
Puberty that never stops.

24
00:01:14,289 --> 00:01:16,166
Ear puberty, nose puberty,
knuckle puberty.

25
00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:18,240
You gotta be vigilant.

26
00:01:18,609 --> 00:01:19,962
All right. Let me ask you this:

27
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:21,881
You know
where Walker Street is downtown?

28
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:25,564
-l got a league meeting there.
-Right, the new job. How is it?

29
00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:28,926
l love it. New office, new salary.
l'm the new Wilhelm.

30
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,317
So who's the new you?

31
00:01:30,489 --> 00:01:33,561
They got an intern
from Francis Lewis High.

32
00:01:34,089 --> 00:01:37,047
His name is Keith.
He comes in Mondays after school.

33
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:38,808
-Hi, Alex.
-l'm sorry l'm late.

34
00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:40,368
-Have you ordered yet?
-No.

35
00:01:40,529 --> 00:01:41,928
l'll be right back.

36
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:45,408
Where are you meeting these women?
When they get off the bus...

37
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:48,367
-...at the Port Authority?
-Right here, George. ln here.

38
00:01:49,129 --> 00:01:54,157
Try opening this up. You'll find
the biggest dating scene in the world.

39
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:56,884
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

40
00:02:04,849 --> 00:02:06,123
-Hey.
-Hey.

41
00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:07,802
-Hi.
-Where's Jerry?

42
00:02:07,969 --> 00:02:10,039
Well, he's in the shower.
You want me to get him?

43
00:02:10,249 --> 00:02:11,648
No, no, no.

44
00:02:12,009 --> 00:02:13,965
Actually,
l kind of need to speak to you.

45
00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:17,087
Oh, well, let's sit down.

46
00:02:24,609 --> 00:02:28,284
Kramer, remember that whole deal
with you selling Peterman...

47
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:31,486
...your stories for his book,
and then he gave them back to you?

48
00:02:32,329 --> 00:02:34,047
Vaguely.

49
00:02:34,449 --> 00:02:39,045
Well, l was kind of
short on material...

50
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:42,201
...and l put them
in the book anyway.

51
00:02:42,369 --> 00:02:45,008
You put my life stories
in his autobiography?

52
00:02:45,169 --> 00:02:46,921
Kramer, listen,
it is such a stupid book.

53
00:02:47,089 --> 00:02:50,968
-lt doesn't matter.
-No, no. Sure it matters.

54
00:02:52,529 --> 00:02:54,963
l've broken through, huh?

55
00:02:55,129 --> 00:02:59,168
l'm part of popular culture now.
Listen, l'd like to thank Mr. Peterman.

56
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:01,889
He's doing a book signing
at Waldenbooks this afternoon.

57
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:05,724
Waldenbooks.
That's a major chain, huh?

58
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:08,607
Hey, Jerry,
l'm going to Waldenbooks.

59
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:12,239
Oh, get out! Get out!
l don't wanna live like this!

60
00:03:14,689 --> 00:03:16,327
All right, let's go.

61
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:22,279
-Mr. Lippman, how are you?
-How are you?

62
00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:25,998
-Well, l'm not bad. Not bad.
-What are you doing here?

63
00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:29,047
l work for Pendant Publishing.
This is our book.

64
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:31,161
lf you can call it that.

65
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:35,762
Why is it every half-wit and sitcom star
has his own book out now?

66
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:41,408
Hey, buddy. Remember me?

67
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:44,561
You're that gangly fellow
we bought the stories from.

68
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:48,039
Yeah, l'm just here to do my part.
What's your name, darling?

69
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:49,881
-Who are you?
-Oh, l'm--

70
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:51,801
Let me use your pen, will you?

71
00:03:52,529 --> 00:03:53,962
--l'm the real Peterman.

72
00:03:54,529 --> 00:03:57,043
All right, playtime's over.

73
00:03:57,889 --> 00:03:59,163
Relax, man.

74
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:02,321
There's enough juice here
to keep us all fat and giggly.

75
00:04:02,689 --> 00:04:05,078
l can't believe somebody
pulled the top off this muffin.

76
00:04:05,249 --> 00:04:07,604
That was me. l'm sorry, l--

77
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:10,442
l don't like the stumps.

78
00:04:11,409 --> 00:04:14,367
-So you just eat the tops?
-Oh, yeah, it's the best part.

79
00:04:14,529 --> 00:04:16,759
lt's crunchy. lt's explosive. lt's--

80
00:04:16,929 --> 00:04:19,568
lt's where the muffin
breaks free of the pan...

81
00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:22,323
...and sort of does its own thing.

82
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:27,798
l'll tell you, that's a million-dollar idea
right there. Just sell the tops.

83
00:04:29,409 --> 00:04:31,001
Okay. Let's go, slim. That's enough.

84
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:32,761
-l have a right to be here.
-Come on.

85
00:04:32,929 --> 00:04:35,966
These are my fans.
Hey, you're hurting my elbow.

86
00:04:38,329 --> 00:04:40,604
Try looking up, hayseed.

87
00:04:42,489 --> 00:04:44,719
You wanna sightsee, get on a bus.

88
00:04:46,129 --> 00:04:48,165
Please don't think
all New Yorkers are so rude.

89
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:50,524
-Well, no, actually l'm--
-l'm Mary Anne.

90
00:04:50,689 --> 00:04:52,520
l work for the New York
Visitors Center.

91
00:04:52,689 --> 00:04:54,486
Where are you visiting from?

92
00:04:55,769 --> 00:04:57,919
Little Rock, Arkansas.

93
00:05:07,489 --> 00:05:09,400
That looks new.

94
00:05:16,889 --> 00:05:19,608
So get this:
Peterman has his henchmen...

95
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:22,283
...forcefully eject me
from the book signing.

96
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:24,883
Like l'm some sort of maniac.

97
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:28,928
-Yeah, that's too bad.
-What's the matter with you?

98
00:05:29,089 --> 00:05:30,841
-Nothing.
-No, no, no, don't give me that.

99
00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:33,603
l know you. Something's wrong.
What is it? What happened?

100
00:05:33,769 --> 00:05:37,557
-l did something stupid.
-What did you do?

101
00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:39,481
-Well, l was shaving...
-Yeah.

102
00:05:39,649 --> 00:05:42,447
...and l noticed an asymmetry
in my chest hair.

103
00:05:42,729 --> 00:05:46,199
And l was trying to even it out.
And the next thing l knew:

104
00:05:46,369 --> 00:05:47,643
Gone.

105
00:05:48,609 --> 00:05:51,248
Don't you know you're not supposed
to poke around down there?

106
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:53,877
-Well, women do it.
-''Well, women do it.''

107
00:05:54,049 --> 00:05:57,086
Well, l'll tell you what. l'll pick you up
a sundress and a parasol...

108
00:05:57,249 --> 00:06:00,605
...and you can just sashay your pretty
little self around the town square.

109
00:06:00,849 --> 00:06:03,283
-Well, what am l gonna tell Alex?
-Now, you listen to me.

110
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:06,361
You don't tell anybody about this.
No one. You hear me?

111
00:06:06,529 --> 00:06:07,803
-Hey.
-Hey.

112
00:06:07,969 --> 00:06:10,039
-Jerry shaved his chest.
-Hey!

113
00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:13,003
l forgot. Wait, never mind.

114
00:06:15,969 --> 00:06:18,358
You couldn't pay me enough
to ride a horse in this city.

115
00:06:18,529 --> 00:06:20,599
lt's hard to cross the street
in sneakers...

116
00:06:20,769 --> 00:06:25,240
...let alone six feet in the air
on a jittery, glassy-eyed dinosaur.

117
00:06:25,409 --> 00:06:27,639
How about the beach this weekend?

118
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:31,247
Well, you couldn't pay me enough
to go to the beach on a weekend.

119
00:06:31,409 --> 00:06:34,003
-l mean, it's hard enough to park--
-All right, all right.

120
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:37,605
ls that a Mexican Hairless?
l love those.

121
00:06:37,769 --> 00:06:43,321
Oh, hairless. This is where it's at.
lt's so much smoother and cleaner.

122
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:45,368
Really?

123
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:49,407
Excuse me.
Are you eating a muffin top?

124
00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:51,958
Yeah, a muffin-top store
just opened up down the street.

125
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:56,086
-A muffin-top store?
-What did l just say?

126
00:07:07,929 --> 00:07:09,328
Top of the muffin to you.

127
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:11,562
Elaine.

128
00:07:12,089 --> 00:07:13,363
Mr. Lippman?

129
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:18,005
So you're pretending to be a tourist?

130
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:20,201
lt's beautiful.

131
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:22,321
She makes all the plans.

132
00:07:22,489 --> 00:07:25,720
l'm not from around here,
so it's okay if l'm stupid.

133
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:28,641
And she knows
l'm only in town visiting...

134
00:07:28,809 --> 00:07:30,800
...so there's no messy break-ups.

135
00:07:30,969 --> 00:07:34,359
-How do you explain your apartment?
-l got a hotel room.

136
00:07:34,849 --> 00:07:36,567
You moved into a hotel?

137
00:07:36,729 --> 00:07:40,199
Well, l don't know anyone here, Jerry.
Where else am l gonna stay?

138
00:07:40,929 --> 00:07:45,161
So get this: We're in the park today.
Alex goes wild for this hairless dog.

139
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:46,922
-So?
-So l figured...

140
00:07:47,089 --> 00:07:50,638
...since she likes one hairless animal,
why not another?

141
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:52,761
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

142
00:07:52,929 --> 00:07:54,760
-You tell her you shaved it?
-Are you nuts?

143
00:07:54,929 --> 00:07:59,639
l don't want her to think l'm a low-rise
briefs guy who shaves his chest.

144
00:08:02,209 --> 00:08:03,642
Hey, Jerry!

145
00:08:05,849 --> 00:08:10,286
l'm starting a Peterman
Reality Bus Tour. Check it out.

146
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,081
Reality tour?

147
00:08:14,249 --> 00:08:18,527
The last thing this guy is qualified
to give a tour of is reality.

148
00:08:19,129 --> 00:08:21,802
This was my idea.
You stole my idea.

149
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:25,006
Elaine, these ideas are all in the air.
They're in the air.

150
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:27,603
Oh, well, then, if that air
is coming out of this face...

151
00:08:27,769 --> 00:08:29,680
...then it is my air and my idea.

152
00:08:29,849 --> 00:08:32,443
-You want a muffin or not?
-Peach.

153
00:08:35,489 --> 00:08:37,639
So l've noticed you don't have
much of an accent.

154
00:08:39,689 --> 00:08:43,284
Yeah, my parents have it.
Sometimes it skips a generation.

155
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:46,962
So l was thinking maybe tonight
we could go back to my hotel.

156
00:08:47,129 --> 00:08:48,960
l got Spectra Vision.

157
00:08:49,369 --> 00:08:51,599
First five minutes free.

158
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:54,441
Look, George...

159
00:08:54,609 --> 00:08:57,282
...l'm really enjoying
spending time with you...

160
00:08:57,449 --> 00:09:00,088
...but l'm not sure
this is gonna work out.

161
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:03,127
At some point you're going back
to your job at Tyler Chicken...

162
00:09:03,289 --> 00:09:05,200
...and your three-legged dog, Willy.

163
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:11,563
And l'm still gonna be here.

164
00:09:12,169 --> 00:09:14,524
Well, what if l told you
l'm thinking of moving here?

165
00:09:16,049 --> 00:09:20,884
George, no offence,
but this city would eat you alive.

166
00:09:27,489 --> 00:09:30,686
You're moving to New York?
That's fantastic.

167
00:09:32,409 --> 00:09:34,639
l can see you all the time now.

168
00:09:35,769 --> 00:09:39,284
Eat me alive, huh?
We'll see who can make it in this town.

169
00:09:39,449 --> 00:09:44,398
-What is it she thinks you can't do?
-Find a job, get an apartment.

170
00:09:44,569 --> 00:09:46,207
How did you do those things?

171
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:50,605
Never mind, they're done.
All l have to do now is redo them.

172
00:09:50,769 --> 00:09:53,841
You know, if you take everything
l've accomplished in my entire life...

173
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:57,081
...and condense it down into one day,
it looks decent.

174
00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:02,441
Hey, what were you doing
with that bus yesterday?

175
00:10:02,609 --> 00:10:06,124
Here you go. Here you go.
Check it out.

176
00:10:07,449 --> 00:10:09,565
''The Real Peterman
Reality Bus Tour.''

177
00:10:09,729 --> 00:10:12,084
-l'm confused.
-That Peterman book is big business.

178
00:10:12,249 --> 00:10:14,319
People wanna know
the stories behind the stories.

179
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,525
Nobody wants to go
on a three-hour bus tour...

180
00:10:16,689 --> 00:10:18,919
...of a totally unknown person's life.

181
00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:23,605
l'm only charging $37.50, plus you get
a pizza bagel and dessert.

182
00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:26,886
-What's dessert?
-Bite-size 3 Musketeers.

183
00:10:27,369 --> 00:10:29,041
Just like the real Peterman eats.

184
00:10:29,209 --> 00:10:32,167
-He eats those?
-No, l eat those.

185
00:10:32,449 --> 00:10:34,201
l'm the real Peterman.

186
00:10:34,609 --> 00:10:35,883
-l don't--
-Wait a minute.

187
00:10:36,249 --> 00:10:38,240
l think l understand this.

188
00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:41,247
J. Peterman is real.
His biography is not.

189
00:10:41,409 --> 00:10:43,286
Now, you, Kramer, are real.

190
00:10:43,449 --> 00:10:46,327
-Talk to me.
-But your life is Peterman's.

191
00:10:46,489 --> 00:10:48,764
Now, the bus tour, which is real...

192
00:10:48,929 --> 00:10:51,124
...takes you to places that,
while they are real...

193
00:10:51,289 --> 00:10:54,247
...they are not real in the sense
that they did not really happen...

194
00:10:54,409 --> 00:10:56,365
...to the real Peterman, which is you.

195
00:10:57,729 --> 00:11:01,085
-Understand?
-Yeah, it's 37.50 for a 3 Musketeers.

196
00:11:05,129 --> 00:11:09,361
Elaine, l'm in over my head.
Nobody likes my muffin tops.

197
00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:11,440
So? What do you want
me to do about it?

198
00:11:11,609 --> 00:11:14,328
You're the muffin-top expert.
Tell me what l'm doing wrong.

199
00:11:14,489 --> 00:11:17,640
Mr. Lippman, when l worked for you
at Pendant Publishing...

200
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:21,119
...l believed in you, you know,
as a man of integrity.

201
00:11:21,289 --> 00:11:26,044
But when l saw you
in that paper hat and that apron--

202
00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:28,439
What if l cut you in
for 30 percent of the profits?

203
00:11:28,609 --> 00:11:30,725
Deal. Here's your problem:

204
00:11:31,809 --> 00:11:34,528
You're making just the muffin tops.

205
00:11:34,689 --> 00:11:38,284
-What do you mean?
-You gotta make the whole muffin.

206
00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:41,043
Then you...

207
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:45,648
...pop the top, toss the stump.

208
00:11:47,449 --> 00:11:48,723
Taste.

209
00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:55,967
-So, what do we do with the bottoms?
-Give them to a soup kitchen.

210
00:11:56,129 --> 00:11:58,199
-lt's a good idea.
-And one more thing.

211
00:11:58,369 --> 00:12:00,519
Do you really think
we need the exclamation point?

212
00:12:00,689 --> 00:12:04,921
Because it's not,
''Top of the muffin to you!''

213
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:06,522
No, no, it is.

214
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:13,081
Hey, Jerry. What's this?

215
00:12:13,729 --> 00:12:15,959
Lady Gillette?

216
00:12:16,129 --> 00:12:18,597
Oh, what's going on?

217
00:12:19,049 --> 00:12:20,323
-Hey.
-What?

218
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,878
-Jeez.
-Can't l get a moment's peace?

219
00:12:23,049 --> 00:12:27,167
-What are you doing to yourself?
-l can't stop.

220
00:12:27,929 --> 00:12:31,683
-Alex thinks l'm naturally hairless.
-What? You can't keep this up.

221
00:12:31,849 --> 00:12:33,362
Don't you know
what's gonna happen?

222
00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:37,204
Every time you shave it, it's gonna
come in thicker and fuller and darker.

223
00:12:37,369 --> 00:12:41,567
-Oh, that's an old wives' tale.
-ls it? Look at this.

224
00:12:42,369 --> 00:12:46,965
-What is--? What is that?
-Look at it! Look at it!

225
00:12:48,889 --> 00:12:51,926
lt's all me.
l shaved there when l was a lifeguard.

226
00:12:52,449 --> 00:12:56,124
Oh, come on. That's genetic.
That's not gonna happen to me.

227
00:12:56,289 --> 00:13:00,248
Won't it?
Or has it already started to happen?

228
00:13:02,409 --> 00:13:04,081
Look at this, we're cleaning up.

229
00:13:04,249 --> 00:13:07,161
Oh, Reuben, get me another tray
of low-fat cranberry, please.

230
00:13:08,489 --> 00:13:12,004
Excuse me. l'm Rebecca DeMornay,
from the homeless shelter.

231
00:13:12,169 --> 00:13:14,683
-Oh, hi.
-Are you the ones...

232
00:13:14,849 --> 00:13:16,999
...leaving those muffin pieces
behind our shelter?

233
00:13:17,169 --> 00:13:19,808
-You've been enjoying them?
-They're just stumps.

234
00:13:20,969 --> 00:13:23,563
-Well, they're perfectly edible.
-Oh, so you just assume...

235
00:13:23,729 --> 00:13:26,004
...the homeless will eat them?
They'll eat anything?

236
00:13:26,169 --> 00:13:28,239
-No, we just thought--
-l know what you thought:

237
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:30,127
''They don't have homes.
Don't have jobs.

238
00:13:30,289 --> 00:13:33,565
What do they need the top of a muffin
for? They're lucky to get stumps.''

239
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:37,085
lf the homeless don't like them,
the homeless don't have to eat them.

240
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:40,047
The homeless don't like them.
We've never had so many complaints.

241
00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:42,404
Every two minutes:
''Where's the top of this muffin?

242
00:13:42,569 --> 00:13:44,719
-Who ate the rest?''
-We were just trying to help.

243
00:13:44,889 --> 00:13:47,323
Why don't you drop off
chicken skins and lobster shells?

244
00:13:47,489 --> 00:13:49,081
l think l might.

245
00:13:49,289 --> 00:13:51,484
l can't believe
you found something so quickly.

246
00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:53,879
-How much are you paying?
-Twenty-three hundred.

247
00:13:54,049 --> 00:13:56,722
-Ouch, a month?
-Yeah.

248
00:13:57,489 --> 00:13:59,241
Well, l guess that's all right for now.

249
00:13:59,409 --> 00:14:02,685
But if you stay here more than
a few months, you're a real sucker.

250
00:14:04,569 --> 00:14:07,481
Yeah, well, l.... l got lots
of other stuff to show you too.

251
00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:09,958
Wait till you see
the plum job that l landed.

252
00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:13,048
Yeah, we should let this place
air out anyway.

253
00:14:13,209 --> 00:14:16,281
lt smells like the last tenant
had monkeys or something.

254
00:14:21,689 --> 00:14:23,042
Okay, coming up on the right...

255
00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:25,769
...if you glance up, you'll just make out
my bedroom window.

256
00:14:25,929 --> 00:14:27,806
lt's the one
that's covered in chicken wire.

257
00:14:27,969 --> 00:14:30,358
Hey, if you're the real Peterman...

258
00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:32,884
...how come you're wearing
those ratty clothes?

259
00:14:33,249 --> 00:14:36,878
-What?
-Well, they're not very romantic.

260
00:14:37,049 --> 00:14:38,323
Well, that's your opinion.

261
00:14:38,489 --> 00:14:41,526
Can l have another 3 Musketeers?
They're rather small.

262
00:14:41,689 --> 00:14:42,963
Forget it.

263
00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:45,404
Okay, Newman's postal route
is around here somewhere.

264
00:14:45,569 --> 00:14:47,161
-Who's Newman?
-Who cares?

265
00:14:47,329 --> 00:14:50,162
Hey, fake Peterman, let me off.
l'm nauseous.

266
00:14:50,329 --> 00:14:51,603
Can l have his candy bar?

267
00:14:52,049 --> 00:14:54,005
Everyone just settle down.

268
00:14:54,249 --> 00:14:56,205
Okay, we got three hours left
on this thing...

269
00:14:56,369 --> 00:14:59,805
...and l can't drive and argue
with you rubes all at the same time.

270
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:05,039
Okay, Lomez's place of worship
is right on the right here.

271
00:15:06,569 --> 00:15:09,879
-Why do l have to go on the tour?
-Jerry, you're a minor celebrity.

272
00:15:10,049 --> 00:15:12,802
You know, if you go on this thing,
it could create a minor stir.

273
00:15:12,969 --> 00:15:16,882
You bring that little girlfriend of yours
and l'll only charge you 60 bucks.

274
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:18,801
-Hey.
-Hey.

275
00:15:18,969 --> 00:15:21,802
-How's business?
-Oh, l got stump trouble.

276
00:15:21,969 --> 00:15:24,199
The sanitation department
won't get rid of them all.

277
00:15:24,369 --> 00:15:26,963
l can't get a truck to haul this stuff
until next week.

278
00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:29,563
Meanwhile, l'm sitting
on a mountain of stumps.

279
00:15:31,169 --> 00:15:32,443
All right.

280
00:15:32,609 --> 00:15:35,487
l gotta hose the puke
off the floor of the bus.

281
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:38,447
Bus? Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Bus? You got a bus?

282
00:15:38,609 --> 00:15:40,201
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Any room on that thing?

283
00:15:40,369 --> 00:15:42,121
There are a few seats still available.

284
00:15:42,329 --> 00:15:45,639
Do you think you could
transport some stumps for me?

285
00:15:45,809 --> 00:15:47,640
l'll make it worth your while.

286
00:15:47,809 --> 00:15:50,448
Well, if they don't mind
sitting in the back.

287
00:15:51,489 --> 00:15:53,047
No, they don't.

288
00:15:53,569 --> 00:15:55,127
Are they war veterans?

289
00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:01,881
This is your office?

290
00:16:02,049 --> 00:16:03,846
Oh, hello. Sorry, George...

291
00:16:04,009 --> 00:16:07,126
...didn't know you had a girl in here.
Leave a signal on the doorknob...

292
00:16:07,289 --> 00:16:09,757
...like a necktie or a sock or something.
Help me out.

293
00:16:09,929 --> 00:16:12,124
Mr. Steinbrenner,
l would like to thank you...

294
00:16:12,289 --> 00:16:14,962
...for taking a chance
on a hen supervisor at Tyler Chicken...

295
00:16:15,129 --> 00:16:18,644
-...like our boy George here.
-Hen supervisor from Tyler Chicken?

296
00:16:18,809 --> 00:16:20,879
Yes, very nice for her
to have met you, sir.

297
00:16:21,049 --> 00:16:22,323
Wait a minute, George.

298
00:16:22,489 --> 00:16:25,242
Be right with you.
Look, Mr. Steinbrenner--

299
00:16:25,409 --> 00:16:27,843
Moonlighting for Tyler Chicken.
lmpressive, George.

300
00:16:28,009 --> 00:16:29,727
Days with Yankees,
nights in Arkansas...

301
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:33,165
...with a topflight bird outfit.
And a hen supervisor, to boot.

302
00:16:33,329 --> 00:16:36,719
l am blown. Blown away.

303
00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:41,246
Blown, George. Blown!

304
00:16:43,449 --> 00:16:45,167
You know,
when you make a pizza bagel...

305
00:16:45,329 --> 00:16:48,082
...you really shouldn't
use cinnamon raisin.

306
00:16:48,249 --> 00:16:51,161
You also shouldn't use a doughnut.

307
00:16:57,409 --> 00:17:00,446
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the Peterman Reality Tour.

308
00:17:00,609 --> 00:17:02,201
Turn music off.

309
00:17:02,369 --> 00:17:05,566
-Kramer, can we just go?
-And go we will.

310
00:17:05,729 --> 00:17:07,640
What is this? Pizza pound cake?

311
00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:09,800
Well, we have a bonus
ultra-reality stop today.

312
00:17:09,969 --> 00:17:13,723
We're gonna be hauling muffin stumps
to the local repository.

313
00:17:13,889 --> 00:17:17,006
-We're going to a garbage dump?
-And we're off.

314
00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:21,681
You know, l never thought he'd
be able to re-create the experience...

315
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:24,568
...of actually knowing him,
but this is pretty close.

316
00:17:27,769 --> 00:17:31,444
Don Tyler? George Steinbrenner here.
l wanna talk about George Costanza.

317
00:17:31,609 --> 00:17:34,169
l understand he's been
dividing his time between us and you.

318
00:17:34,329 --> 00:17:36,604
-l cannot have that.
-Well, l don't know who he is...

319
00:17:36,769 --> 00:17:39,329
...but if you want him that bad,
l'm not giving up easy.

320
00:17:39,489 --> 00:17:42,128
Oh, is that so? Playing a little
hardball, huh, Donny boy?

321
00:17:42,289 --> 00:17:44,803
How about this:
You give me Costanza.

322
00:17:44,969 --> 00:17:47,961
l convert your concessions
to all chicken, no charge.

323
00:17:48,129 --> 00:17:51,326
lnstead of hot dogs, chicken dogs.
lnstead of pretzels, chicken twists.

324
00:17:51,489 --> 00:17:53,764
lnstead of beer, alcoholic chicken.

325
00:17:53,969 --> 00:17:57,325
-How do you make alcoholic chicken?
-They ferment, just like anything else.

326
00:17:57,489 --> 00:18:01,607
That stuff sounds great. All right,
l'll have Costanza on the next bus.

327
00:18:04,769 --> 00:18:07,329
Hey, hey, hey.
Where do you think you're going?

328
00:18:07,489 --> 00:18:10,686
-Well, l was gonna dump this.
-lt doesn't look like garbage.

329
00:18:10,849 --> 00:18:13,841
-Well, it's muffin stumps.
-Where are the muffin tops?

330
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:16,443
This is a garbage dump.
Just let me dump it.

331
00:18:16,649 --> 00:18:18,241
Can't do it.

332
00:18:18,409 --> 00:18:22,960
-ls this a joke?
-That's what l like to know about it.

333
00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:27,363
You have a pretty heavy beard,
don't you?

334
00:18:27,529 --> 00:18:30,726
-What's that?
-Look, it's almost time for you to shave.

335
00:18:30,929 --> 00:18:34,160
Oh, yeah.

336
00:18:35,569 --> 00:18:39,005
Well, maybe l will take it up
with Consumer Affairs!

337
00:18:41,849 --> 00:18:44,488
Well, ladies and gentlemen,
you're in for an additional treat.

338
00:18:44,649 --> 00:18:47,243
We're going to extend the tour
at no extra charge.

339
00:18:47,409 --> 00:18:49,400
-Where are we going?
-l don't know.

340
00:18:49,569 --> 00:18:51,480
No more questions.

341
00:19:12,169 --> 00:19:17,084
So the New York Yankees traded you
for a bunch of Tyler Chicken?

342
00:19:17,249 --> 00:19:22,607
Dogs, twists,
and a fermented chicken drink.

343
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:26,287
Hey, aren't you the guy
l asked to watch my clothes?

344
00:19:26,529 --> 00:19:27,882
-What clothes?
-These clothes.

345
00:19:28,049 --> 00:19:29,960
The ones you're wearing.

346
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:35,962
-Kramer, how much longer?
-What?

347
00:19:36,129 --> 00:19:38,768
My chest hair's growing back,
and it's itching me like crazy.

348
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:41,318
-l can't let her see me scratch it.
-Well, don't worry.

349
00:19:41,489 --> 00:19:45,721
-l got a good feeling about this dump.
-l tell you, man, l'm losing it.

350
00:19:54,769 --> 00:19:57,329
l can't sit on this bus anymore.

351
00:19:57,489 --> 00:19:59,878
l think l'll go play with that dog.

352
00:20:02,049 --> 00:20:03,801
l don't know where the tops are.

353
00:20:09,169 --> 00:20:11,444
Jerry, what's the matter?

354
00:20:28,529 --> 00:20:30,520
That feels good.

355
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:39,644
-Oh, hey, you looking for George?
-Yes.

356
00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:43,199
He's been in the bathroom a while.
You might wanna check on him.

357
00:20:44,249 --> 00:20:46,126
Jerry, you gotta bring me
some clothes here.

358
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:47,642
l lost my job with the Yankees.

359
00:20:47,809 --> 00:20:50,482
l'm standing in a men's room
on 43rd Street in my underpants.

360
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:54,005
l told you
this city would eat you alive.

361
00:20:56,449 --> 00:20:59,122
And l think my relationship's
in trouble.

362
00:21:01,889 --> 00:21:04,767
-What is this guy again?
-They call him a cleaner.

363
00:21:04,929 --> 00:21:07,489
He makes problems go away.

364
00:21:24,609 --> 00:21:26,520
-Hello, Elaine.
-Where did you get the car?

365
00:21:26,689 --> 00:21:28,281
lt's a rental.

366
00:21:29,209 --> 00:21:31,484
-Where are they?
-ln the back.

367
00:21:32,289 --> 00:21:35,167
All right. l'm gonna need
a clean eight-ounce glass.

368
00:21:35,329 --> 00:21:40,244
-What is going on here?
-lf l'm curt, then l apologize.

369
00:21:40,449 --> 00:21:42,838
But as l understand it,
we have a situation here.

370
00:21:43,009 --> 00:21:45,204
And time is of the essence.
