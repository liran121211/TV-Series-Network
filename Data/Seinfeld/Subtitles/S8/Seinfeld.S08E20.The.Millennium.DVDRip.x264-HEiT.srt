1
00:00:05,329 --> 00:00:07,285
Excuse me.

2
00:00:07,449 --> 00:00:09,326
Be with you in a minute.

3
00:00:09,489 --> 00:00:11,957
No, you should have come
last night.

4
00:00:12,129 --> 00:00:13,960
lt was fun.

5
00:00:14,129 --> 00:00:16,723
l just have a question.

6
00:00:16,889 --> 00:00:20,359
l know. The margaritas
in that place are so strong.

7
00:00:20,529 --> 00:00:22,599
Hello.

8
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:25,158
l'd like to buy these huaraches.

9
00:00:26,249 --> 00:00:30,162
So, what else is going on?

10
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:31,808
Hey!

11
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:35,282
Listen, l'll call you back.

12
00:00:35,889 --> 00:00:38,847
Yes? What can l do for you?

13
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:42,363
Nothing. You just lost a customer.

14
00:00:52,729 --> 00:00:54,481
Ready? l don't wanna miss
the previews.

15
00:00:54,649 --> 00:00:56,287
Me neither. l love the previews.

16
00:00:56,449 --> 00:00:58,280
ln fact, l enjoy being
the theatre cutup.

17
00:00:58,449 --> 00:01:02,522
Last week after a preview,
l yelled out, '' Must miss!''

18
00:01:02,689 --> 00:01:06,204
l think that l was in that theatre.
That was really funny.

19
00:01:06,369 --> 00:01:07,848
Yeah, l got a good laugh.

20
00:01:08,929 --> 00:01:11,523
Let me just check
my messages before we go.

21
00:01:20,929 --> 00:01:23,489
-So you're on the speed dial?
-After two dates.

22
00:01:23,889 --> 00:01:25,402
-What number?
-Seven.

23
00:01:25,569 --> 00:01:27,366
You know, it's a pain to change that.

24
00:01:27,529 --> 00:01:30,362
You've got to lift up
that plastic thing with a pen.

25
00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:33,721
-Hey, buddy.
-Hey.

26
00:01:33,889 --> 00:01:36,119
ls it all right if l keep these here
for a while?

27
00:01:36,289 --> 00:01:38,200
l'm having a New Year's Eve party.

28
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:40,280
You're keeping these here
for eight months?

29
00:01:40,449 --> 00:01:44,408
No, Jerry. New Year's Eve, 1 999,
the millennium.

30
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:45,922
l told you about that.

31
00:01:46,089 --> 00:01:49,081
You're gonna leave these chairs here
for two and a half years?

32
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:50,768
You're not gonna see them.

33
00:01:50,929 --> 00:01:54,319
l got a case of party poppers
l'm gonna keep in front of them.

34
00:01:55,129 --> 00:01:56,403
Hey, so get this.

35
00:01:56,569 --> 00:01:59,288
l got a call this morning
from the Mets' front-office guys.

36
00:01:59,449 --> 00:02:01,838
-They want to take me out to lunch.
-What for?

37
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:05,763
l'm on a winning ball club, Jerry.
They probably want to pick my brain.

38
00:02:06,249 --> 00:02:08,843
Really, why do you think
they're taking you out to lunch?

39
00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:11,844
l have no idea.

40
00:02:12,009 --> 00:02:14,921
All right, l have had it
with those Mayans.

41
00:02:15,089 --> 00:02:16,408
l don't mind the Mayans.

42
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:20,642
You know that store, Putumayo?
l was trying to buy these huaraches...

43
00:02:20,809 --> 00:02:23,642
...and this saleswoman
just completely ignored me.

44
00:02:23,809 --> 00:02:25,242
Are we talking huaraches?

45
00:02:26,609 --> 00:02:28,486
l know a great store for huaraches.

46
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,128
No, no, not Putumayo.

47
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:32,280
No, no, Cinco de Mayo.

48
00:02:32,449 --> 00:02:34,246
Yeah, Marcelino,
he turned me onto it.

49
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:37,003
And he's 1 I64 Mayan.

50
00:02:37,169 --> 00:02:39,478
l'm starting to get nervous
about this lunch.

51
00:02:39,649 --> 00:02:41,367
What did you have?

52
00:02:46,449 --> 00:02:49,122
Keep these here too, huh?
They'll be all right.

53
00:02:49,289 --> 00:02:52,725
Kramer, these balloons aren't
gonna stay filled until New Year's.

54
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:56,798
Those aren't for New Year's.
Those are my everyday balloons.

55
00:03:00,649 --> 00:03:03,721
George, we'll be blunt. The Mets need
somebody to head up scouting.

56
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:05,880
And we think that someone
might be you.

57
00:03:06,049 --> 00:03:08,119
-Head of scouting?
-lnterested?

58
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:10,720
l'm still here.

59
00:03:11,249 --> 00:03:14,321
Unfortunately, league rules
prevent us from making you an offer...

60
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:16,207
...while you're still under contract.

61
00:03:16,369 --> 00:03:18,564
Do you understand
what we're talking about?

62
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:20,521
-So you're talking--?
-No, no.

63
00:03:20,689 --> 00:03:22,759
We're not talking.

64
00:03:22,929 --> 00:03:26,444
We're just talking.

65
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:31,287
-So you need me to get fired?
-We didn't say that.

66
00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:33,246
We couldn't say that. Even if we did--

67
00:03:33,409 --> 00:03:36,003
-We couldn't say that we said it.
-See what we're saying?

68
00:03:36,409 --> 00:03:38,764
But you are still paying
for this lunch?

69
00:03:38,929 --> 00:03:40,567
We didn't say that.

70
00:03:44,529 --> 00:03:46,485
Hi. Sorry l'm late.

71
00:03:46,649 --> 00:03:49,368
There's a lot of chairs
and balloons in my apartment.

72
00:03:51,289 --> 00:03:53,644
How about l make it up
to you with dinner?

73
00:03:53,809 --> 00:03:55,208
Someplace nice this time?

74
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:57,963
Yeah, l'm sorry about
that Mongolian barbecue last night.

75
00:03:58,129 --> 00:03:59,960
l had heard good things.

76
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:01,403
l don't know.

77
00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:03,719
lt got a two in Zagat's.

78
00:04:04,249 --> 00:04:06,968
Let me just check my messages.

79
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:09,962
Maybe a nicer girl called.

80
00:04:11,369 --> 00:04:13,485
-Hello.
-Hello?

81
00:04:13,649 --> 00:04:15,128
-Who's this?
-Jane.

82
00:04:16,609 --> 00:04:19,043
-What number did you dial?
-Seven.

83
00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:25,082
Hey! See these?

84
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:28,602
Cinco de Mayo.

85
00:04:29,209 --> 00:04:32,804
Sales commission, bye-bye-o.

86
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,009
-Good meeting?
-There was no meeting.

87
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:48,201
But it was quite a meeting.

88
00:04:48,369 --> 00:04:52,362
You are looking at
the next director of Mets scouting.

89
00:04:52,529 --> 00:04:55,362
The only thing is l have to get fired
from the Yankees first.

90
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:58,089
-You can do that.
-Of course.

91
00:04:58,249 --> 00:05:01,685
But l really want to leave
my mark this time, you know?

92
00:05:01,849 --> 00:05:04,283
l wanna walk away from the Yankees
with people saying:

93
00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:08,362
''Wow! Now, that guy got canned.''

94
00:05:09,569 --> 00:05:12,288
So you want to go out
in a final blaze of incompetence.

95
00:05:12,849 --> 00:05:15,238
Remember at Dairy Queen
where l cooled my feet...

96
00:05:15,409 --> 00:05:17,081
...in the soft-serve machine?

97
00:05:18,809 --> 00:05:22,040
Think people will still be using
napkins in the year 2000?

98
00:05:22,209 --> 00:05:25,485
Or is this mouth-vacuum thing
for real?

99
00:05:28,809 --> 00:05:30,765
-So, George.
-Yeah.

100
00:05:31,649 --> 00:05:33,605
l had, like, a so-so date with Valerie.

101
00:05:33,769 --> 00:05:35,885
Now l'm number nine
on the speed dial.

102
00:05:36,049 --> 00:05:38,119
-So?
-So l used to be seven.

103
00:05:38,289 --> 00:05:39,563
l dropped two spots.

104
00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:40,957
What? She's ranking you?

105
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:44,041
Yeah, the speed dial's like
a relationship barometer.

106
00:05:44,209 --> 00:05:45,801
What is a barometer exactly?

107
00:05:45,969 --> 00:05:48,529
lt's pronounced ''thermometer.''

108
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:57,166
You know, in the year 2000,
we'll all be on speed dial.

109
00:05:57,329 --> 00:05:59,763
You just think of a person,
they'll be talking to you.

110
00:05:59,929 --> 00:06:02,966
lt'll be like,
'' l'm getting a call here.

111
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:05,968
Hey, it's Newman.

112
00:06:06,129 --> 00:06:07,528
Hey, how you doing, Newman?

113
00:06:07,689 --> 00:06:10,681
-I'm not here.
-Oh, you want to talk to Jerry?''

114
00:06:15,329 --> 00:06:18,287
Flowers. You didn't have to do that.

115
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:23,523
l mean, the dinner and the play
and the hansom cab ride.

116
00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:27,682
Well, l just wanted to-- You forgot
the gift certificate to Barnes & Noble.

117
00:06:27,849 --> 00:06:29,567
--you know,
make a good impression.

118
00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:32,846
-l'm gonna go put these in some water.
-l like the way you think.

119
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:42,043
Oh, my God, number one!

120
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:45,918
Seinfeld, you magnificent bastard.

121
00:06:46,969 --> 00:06:51,485
Sorry l'm late, but look what l found in
the Yankee Hall of Pride display case.

122
00:06:51,649 --> 00:06:53,560
lsn't that Babe's Ruth uniform?

123
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:57,207
ls it? Strawberries, anyone?

124
00:06:58,849 --> 00:07:01,727
lt's good. Juicy this time of year.

125
00:07:02,929 --> 00:07:04,203
Gotta get the good ones.

126
00:07:04,369 --> 00:07:07,520
Oh, that's bad. That's bad.

127
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:11,323
Jerry, my millennium party's
really coming together.

128
00:07:11,489 --> 00:07:14,162
Will people be able to breathe
underwater in 2000?

129
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:16,087
Some of us.

130
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:19,000
l don't want to exclude anybody.

131
00:07:26,929 --> 00:07:28,647
Shove it.

132
00:07:30,489 --> 00:07:31,683
What is all this?

133
00:07:31,849 --> 00:07:33,760
l got all of this junk
at Cinco de Mayo...

134
00:07:33,929 --> 00:07:35,965
...because l was trying
to show Putumayo...

135
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:37,642
...how much business they'd lost.

136
00:07:37,809 --> 00:07:39,720
l mean, l've been dancing
and strutting...

137
00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:42,084
...in front of their store for two days.

138
00:07:42,249 --> 00:07:44,968
Oh, no wonder
we're getting so much rain.

139
00:07:45,689 --> 00:07:48,362
Elaine, l'm having a millennium party,
so save the date.

140
00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:52,727
Hey, you know what? Newman sent
me an invitation already to his party.

141
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,163
-Newman?
-Yeah.

142
00:07:55,569 --> 00:07:59,403
'' Come celebrate the millennium
with 'Newmannium.'''

143
00:08:00,369 --> 00:08:01,563
Newman.

144
00:08:05,329 --> 00:08:07,320
Hi, Valerie.

145
00:08:07,489 --> 00:08:10,242
-You're not Valerie.
-l'm her stepmother.

146
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:12,083
Drive.

147
00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:17,564
lt's taken me 1 3 years to climb up
to the top of that speed dial...

148
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:21,404
...and l don't intend
to lose my spot to you.

149
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:25,604
-But l never--
-You just stay away from that phone.

150
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:29,283
You wanted to see me, sir?

151
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:31,360
l heard about what happened
at the meeting.

152
00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:34,646
Yes. l already packed up my desk.
l could be out of here in an hour.

153
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:37,881
And l have to tell you it's exactly
what this organization needed.

154
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:41,283
To look to the future,
we've gotta tear down the past.

155
00:08:41,449 --> 00:08:44,919
Babe Ruth was nothing more
than a fat old man with little-girl legs.

156
00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:47,649
And here's something
l just found out recently.

157
00:08:47,809 --> 00:08:51,006
He wasn't really a sultan, huh?
What do you make of that?

158
00:08:51,889 --> 00:08:53,607
Hey, check this out.

159
00:08:53,769 --> 00:08:56,078
Lou Gehrig's pants. Not a bad fit.

160
00:08:56,249 --> 00:08:59,047
You don't think that disease of his
was contagious, do you?

161
00:08:59,209 --> 00:09:01,598
Better take them off.
l'm too important to this team.

162
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:03,839
Big Stein can't be flopping
and twitching.

163
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:06,443
Hey, how about some lunch?
What are you going for?

164
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:14,522
You know, Valerie, l couldn't help
but notice that l'm on your speed dial.

165
00:09:14,689 --> 00:09:16,247
You deserve it.

166
00:09:16,409 --> 00:09:17,762
But l can't help thinking...

167
00:09:17,929 --> 00:09:20,841
...that maybe there's someone
in your life who deserves it more.

168
00:09:21,009 --> 00:09:24,843
Someone you've known,
you know, more than a week.

169
00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:27,284
My stepmother got to you,
didn't she?

170
00:09:27,449 --> 00:09:28,677
What? No.

171
00:09:28,849 --> 00:09:30,885
l can't believe she did this again.

172
00:09:31,569 --> 00:09:35,926
That's it.
She's off the speed dial completely.

173
00:09:40,849 --> 00:09:44,524
Well, l just got your invitation
to the Newmannium party.

174
00:09:44,689 --> 00:09:47,806
You just got it?
Damn, the mail is slow.

175
00:09:47,969 --> 00:09:49,880
You knew l was having
a millennium party...

176
00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:52,244
...but you had to throw yours
on the same day.

177
00:09:52,409 --> 00:09:54,206
l have done nothing unethical.

178
00:09:54,369 --> 00:09:57,520
You have to cancel it, because
l've told everybody about my party.

179
00:09:57,689 --> 00:10:01,443
Cancel? Think again, long shanks.

180
00:10:01,609 --> 00:10:04,123
l started planning this in 1 978.

181
00:10:04,289 --> 00:10:07,565
l put a deposit down on that restaurant
that overlooks Times Square.

182
00:10:07,729 --> 00:10:10,687
And l booked Christopher Cross.

183
00:10:10,849 --> 00:10:13,647
Well, what am l gonna do?
l've got over 200 folding chairs...

184
00:10:13,809 --> 00:10:15,640
...and quite a bit of ice.

185
00:10:15,809 --> 00:10:17,879
-What kind?
-Cubed.

186
00:10:18,049 --> 00:10:19,721
That's good stuff.

187
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:22,278
And you can never have
too much ice.

188
00:10:22,449 --> 00:10:24,360
All right, l'll tell you what l'll do.

189
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:28,602
You can cohost the party
with me under one condition.

190
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:31,567
No Jerry. Jerry is not invited.

191
00:10:31,729 --> 00:10:33,560
l got to invite Jerry. He's my buddy.

192
00:10:33,729 --> 00:10:37,165
That he may be, but he's out of my life
starting in the year 2000.

193
00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:41,959
For me, the next millennium
must be Jerry-free.

194
00:10:43,889 --> 00:10:45,242
How could they not fire you?

195
00:10:45,409 --> 00:10:47,365
Never thought l'd fail at failing.

196
00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:48,757
Oh, come on, now.

197
00:10:49,169 --> 00:10:51,967
-Feel like l can't do anything wrong.
-Nonsense.

198
00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:53,960
You do everything wrong.

199
00:10:54,129 --> 00:10:55,687
-Everything?
-Everything.

200
00:10:55,849 --> 00:10:57,919
-You really think so?
-Absolutely.

201
00:10:58,089 --> 00:11:00,603
l have no confidence in you.

202
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:02,248
All right.

203
00:11:02,409 --> 00:11:05,162
l guess l just have to pick myself up,
dust myself off...

204
00:11:05,329 --> 00:11:07,081
...and throw myself back down again.

205
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:10,161
That's the spirit. You suck.

206
00:11:10,329 --> 00:11:12,047
l know.

207
00:11:13,249 --> 00:11:16,127
No, no, no, listen to me.
l work in fashion.

208
00:11:16,289 --> 00:11:19,645
Together we can drive
Putumayo out of business...

209
00:11:19,809 --> 00:11:24,166
...and make Cinco de Mayo,
numero uno de Mayo.

210
00:11:24,929 --> 00:11:27,159
Do you need some help
with something?

211
00:11:28,049 --> 00:11:29,641
You? What are you doing here?

212
00:11:29,809 --> 00:11:31,686
l own this store.

213
00:11:32,089 --> 00:11:34,239
No, you don't. You own Putumayo.

214
00:11:34,409 --> 00:11:37,162
Unless you own both stores.

215
00:11:38,689 --> 00:11:40,566
l'm Gladys Mayo.

216
00:11:44,849 --> 00:11:48,125
This really sticks in my craw.

217
00:11:51,569 --> 00:11:55,244
Well, Mrs. Hamilton, it's nice that
you and Valerie patched things up...

218
00:11:55,409 --> 00:11:57,969
...so we could all
get together like this.

219
00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:00,520
Where is Valerie?

220
00:12:00,689 --> 00:12:02,122
l'm sure she'll be along.

221
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:03,961
Have some wine, Jerome.

222
00:12:04,129 --> 00:12:05,482
Okay.

223
00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:10,325
You know, Jerome, l can understand
what Valerie sees in you.

224
00:12:10,489 --> 00:12:16,007
So attractive, so strong, so comedic.

225
00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:19,162
Good.

226
00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:24,405
Jerome, l have
a deliciously naughty idea.

227
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:26,283
What?

228
00:12:27,089 --> 00:12:30,365
Why don't l put you
on my speed dial?

229
00:12:32,489 --> 00:12:34,400
l don't know, Mrs. Hamilton.
That doesn't--

230
00:12:34,569 --> 00:12:36,685
Don't be such a child, Jerome.

231
00:12:36,849 --> 00:12:38,965
How's number three sound?

232
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:42,121
Valerie's not coming over, is she?

233
00:12:42,289 --> 00:12:44,723
-Seven, four, two....
-No.

234
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,481
Stop. Stop. This isn't right.

235
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:49,209
-What about Valerie?
-l won't tell if you don't.

236
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:50,848
Oh, my--

237
00:12:56,169 --> 00:12:57,887
Jerry.

238
00:12:58,049 --> 00:12:59,687
Newman.

239
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:01,683
lt's 2000.

240
00:13:01,849 --> 00:13:03,760
Newmannium!

241
00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:11,847
Oh, Jerry.

242
00:13:16,689 --> 00:13:20,125
Yank ees 2, Orioles nothing.
Wait a minute.

243
00:13:20,289 --> 00:13:23,645
A short, stocky, bald man
is streaking across the field.

244
00:13:24,369 --> 00:13:25,597
Oh, my God, George.

245
00:13:25,769 --> 00:13:27,202
Check that. He's not streaking.

246
00:13:27,369 --> 00:13:29,200
He's wearing
a flesh-toned body stocking.

247
00:13:29,369 --> 00:13:33,521
Apparently he's a bit bashful,
and oddly, no one seems upset.

248
00:13:34,089 --> 00:13:36,284
-Kramer, look. lt's George.
-Everyone loves him.

249
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:37,484
Yeah, l know.

250
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:40,846
Listen, Jerry, l can't let you come
to my New Year's party.

251
00:13:41,009 --> 00:13:42,442
-All right.
-lt's killing me.

252
00:13:42,609 --> 00:13:46,284
Newman's got the jump on the invites
and will crush me if l try to go it alone.

253
00:13:46,449 --> 00:13:47,848
-No problem.
-You're right.

254
00:13:48,009 --> 00:13:49,647
l won't do it without you.

255
00:13:49,809 --> 00:13:51,720
Oh, l feel so ashamed
l even thought of it.

256
00:13:53,329 --> 00:13:55,479
Elaine, you can't go
to Newman's Newmannium.

257
00:13:55,649 --> 00:13:57,560
-Okay.
-No, no, no, you've got to spend...

258
00:13:57,729 --> 00:13:59,924
...New Year's 1 999
with me and Jerry.

259
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,284
-Fine.
-Oh, come on!

260
00:14:02,449 --> 00:14:04,041
-All right.
-Yes, all right.

261
00:14:04,209 --> 00:14:06,245
So it's you, it's me
and it's Jerry, huh?

262
00:14:06,409 --> 00:14:09,640
Now things are starting to snowball.
l'll tell Newman l don't need him.

263
00:14:09,809 --> 00:14:12,607
So l'll see you two
in the 21 st century.

264
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,122
Okay. Kramer, wait a minute.

265
00:14:14,289 --> 00:14:16,120
-You still have that pricing gun?
-Yeah.

266
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:18,803
Okay. l need you to help
put Putumayo out of business.

267
00:14:19,489 --> 00:14:21,286
Can do.

268
00:14:21,449 --> 00:14:23,041
What you doing with a pricing gun?

269
00:14:23,409 --> 00:14:28,642
That place is about to have the sale
of the century. Nothing over 99 cents.

270
00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:30,765
Still a rip-off.

271
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:35,044
-Hello.
-l was just at my stepmom's house...

272
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:37,325
...and l saw that you were
on her speed dial.

273
00:14:37,489 --> 00:14:41,164
Well, she probably just wanted
to be able to keep tabs on you.

274
00:14:41,329 --> 00:14:42,842
Hold on a second.

275
00:14:43,009 --> 00:14:44,840
-Hello.
-Hi, Jerome.

276
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,761
Mrs. Hamilton,
this is a very bad time.

277
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:50,126
l've got Valerie on the other line.
Just a second.

278
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:52,007
-Hello.
-That's her, isn't it?

279
00:14:52,169 --> 00:14:54,239
-Well....
-l don't want you on her speed dial.

280
00:14:54,409 --> 00:14:55,728
Hang on.

281
00:14:55,889 --> 00:14:58,881
She knows about the speed dial.
You gotta get me off this thing.

282
00:14:59,049 --> 00:15:01,768
l won't until she puts me
back on hers.

283
00:15:01,929 --> 00:15:03,282
Hang on.

284
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:05,087
She wants to be back on yours.

285
00:15:05,249 --> 00:15:08,047
-Fine. But only if you're off hers.
-Hang on.

286
00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:09,608
Fine, if l'm off yours.

287
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:12,158
-No, still me.
-Sorry, hang on.

288
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:13,967
Fine, if l'm off yours.

289
00:15:14,129 --> 00:15:17,439
l won't do it. lt's my speed dial
and l don't trust her.

290
00:15:17,609 --> 00:15:20,362
Please, Mrs. Hamilton,
this is very awkward for me.

291
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:21,882
All right.

292
00:15:22,049 --> 00:15:24,324
l'll hide you in one
of the emergency buttons.

293
00:15:24,489 --> 00:15:25,717
Great. Bye.

294
00:15:25,889 --> 00:15:28,119
-She said she'll do it.
-Great.

295
00:15:28,289 --> 00:15:29,608
Hang on.

296
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:32,363
-Hello.
-Jerry.

297
00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:34,485
l can't get fired.

298
00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:36,241
Hey, Body-Suit Man, what's up?

299
00:15:36,409 --> 00:15:39,446
-Hey, Body-Suit Man.
-Hey, look at that.

300
00:15:39,609 --> 00:15:41,884
-Body-Suit Man.
-Hey!

301
00:15:52,689 --> 00:15:54,600
Hi, l'm H.E. Pennypacker.

302
00:15:54,769 --> 00:15:57,966
l'm a wealthy
American industrialist...

303
00:15:58,129 --> 00:16:01,201
...looking to open a silver mine
in the mountains of Peru.

304
00:16:01,369 --> 00:16:04,566
And before l invest millions
in a lucrative mine...

305
00:16:04,729 --> 00:16:06,765
...l'd like to go a little native.

306
00:16:06,929 --> 00:16:10,080
Get the feel of their condiments,
their unmentionables.

307
00:16:10,249 --> 00:16:15,243
-You know, the real gritty-gritty.
-Well, let me show you what we have.

308
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:18,845
No, no, l think l can just
browse around on my own.

309
00:16:19,009 --> 00:16:20,761
Machu Picchu.

310
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:24,126
-Are these free?
-Yeah.

311
00:16:33,729 --> 00:16:35,799
Some of those are women's clothes.

312
00:16:35,969 --> 00:16:38,119
Oh, not a problem.

313
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:52,124
Attention, Steinbrenner
and front-office morons.

314
00:16:52,289 --> 00:16:54,678
Your triumphs mean nothing.

315
00:16:55,369 --> 00:16:57,439
You all stink.

316
00:16:57,609 --> 00:17:02,080
You can sit on it and rotate!

317
00:17:02,249 --> 00:17:05,161
This is George Costanza.

318
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:06,682
l fear no reprisal.

319
00:17:07,689 --> 00:17:11,159
Extension 51 7 0.

320
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:17,480
Come on.
What is taking you so long?

321
00:17:17,649 --> 00:17:20,322
l broke the price gun,
so l had to move to plan B.

322
00:17:20,769 --> 00:17:22,441
-Plan B?
-Yeah.

323
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:24,088
There is no plan B.

324
00:17:24,249 --> 00:17:27,400
l took these out of every single
garment in the store.

325
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:29,480
-What?
-They're desiccants.

326
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:31,002
See, they absorb moisture.

327
00:17:31,169 --> 00:17:34,366
These clothes won't last
five years without them.

328
00:17:35,729 --> 00:17:38,880
-That's not gonna do anything.
-Patience.

329
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:40,880
-All right, forget it.
-What?

330
00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:44,280
You have screwed me again,
Pennypacker.

331
00:17:47,729 --> 00:17:49,321
Ladies, care for some chips?

332
00:17:49,489 --> 00:17:51,559
Well, l don't mind if l do.

333
00:17:56,729 --> 00:17:59,607
Well, l've changed my mind.

334
00:17:59,769 --> 00:18:03,000
l think l'm going to build
a roller coaster instead.

335
00:18:18,969 --> 00:18:21,642
l heard what you did
in the parking lot, big boy....

336
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,642
...and it is inexcusable.

337
00:18:25,889 --> 00:18:27,641
Personally insulting me, my staff.

338
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:29,959
l cannot believe that you,
Body-Suit Man...

339
00:18:30,129 --> 00:18:32,085
...could perpetrate
such a disloyal deed.

340
00:18:32,249 --> 00:18:34,888
lt breaks my heart to say it.
Who am l kidding? l love it.

341
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:37,040
-You're--
-Wait! Wait, Mr. Steinbrenner.

342
00:18:37,209 --> 00:18:38,801
George doesn't deserve
any blame...

343
00:18:38,969 --> 00:18:41,085
...for what happened
in the parking lot today.

344
00:18:41,249 --> 00:18:44,286
-lf there's anyone to blame, it's me.
-What are you talking about?

345
00:18:44,449 --> 00:18:46,758
-You popping pills? Got the crazies?
-No, sir.

346
00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:50,239
l ordered George to drive around
insulting people today...

347
00:18:50,409 --> 00:18:54,288
...because l'm tired
of all your macho head games.

348
00:18:54,449 --> 00:18:58,283
He's lying, sir. l'm tired
of all your macho head games.

349
00:18:58,449 --> 00:19:01,043
-Macho head games?
-He's just being loyal to me, sir.

350
00:19:01,209 --> 00:19:02,688
Wilhelm, you're fired.

351
00:19:02,849 --> 00:19:04,999
l owe you an apology,
Body-Suit Man. Streak on.

352
00:19:05,169 --> 00:19:08,002
Now, if you'll excuse me.
l'm not going to the game today.

353
00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:10,319
l'm going to go outside
and scalp some tickets.

354
00:19:10,489 --> 00:19:13,561
Owner's box. That's gotta bring
in 40 bucks, no problem.

355
00:19:14,209 --> 00:19:15,767
Mr. Wilhelm, what was that?

356
00:19:15,929 --> 00:19:17,328
l wanted to get fired.

357
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:23,200
George, you are looking at the new
head scout of the New York Mets.

358
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:32,039
l don't know what Elaine
is so upset about.

359
00:19:32,209 --> 00:19:36,248
Without desiccants, those clothes
will be noticeably musty in five years.

360
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:38,047
She never sees the big picture.

361
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:45,882
-Hello, Newman.
-Hello, Jerry.

362
00:19:46,449 --> 00:19:47,768
What did you say to Elaine?

363
00:19:47,929 --> 00:19:49,726
l just got her cancellation
in the mail.

364
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:52,926
Oh, well, l guess she found
someplace better to go.

365
00:19:53,089 --> 00:19:57,924
Well, it's her mistake because she's
going to miss the party of a lifetime.

366
00:19:58,089 --> 00:20:00,728
Well, maybe so,
but come midnight...

367
00:20:00,889 --> 00:20:04,120
...when she's looking for someone
warm and cuddly to kiss...

368
00:20:04,289 --> 00:20:08,043
...l guess you'll be caught between
the moon and New York City.

369
00:20:10,369 --> 00:20:14,806
All right. Come back
to my party, please.

370
00:20:15,329 --> 00:20:17,365
Jerry too, of course.

371
00:20:19,689 --> 00:20:21,884
You don't wanna do your act
or anything, do you?

372
00:20:22,049 --> 00:20:24,688
-No.
-All right, then.

373
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:29,445
l guess l can accept a little Jerry
if it gets me a lot of Elaine.

374
00:20:31,329 --> 00:20:32,887
-Deal?
-To the Newmannium.

375
00:20:33,049 --> 00:20:34,846
To the '' Kramennium.''

376
00:20:36,729 --> 00:20:38,560
By the way, Newman,
l'm just curious.

377
00:20:38,729 --> 00:20:42,438
When you booked the hotel, did you
book it for the millennium New Year?

378
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:44,759
As a matter of fact, l did.

379
00:20:44,929 --> 00:20:47,124
That's interesting,
because as everyone knows...

380
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:48,722
...since there was no year 0...

381
00:20:48,889 --> 00:20:52,120
...the millennium doesn't begin
until the year 2001 ...

382
00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:55,486
...which would make your party
one year late...

383
00:20:55,649 --> 00:20:59,005
...and thus quite lame.

384
00:21:11,529 --> 00:21:13,645
l don't feel well at all.

385
00:21:13,809 --> 00:21:17,802
l feel all dried-out inside.

386
00:21:17,969 --> 00:21:19,721
-l'll call for help.
-Okay.

387
00:21:24,369 --> 00:21:26,087
-Hello.
-Who's this?

388
00:21:26,249 --> 00:21:29,366
-lt's Jerry. Who's this?
-lt's Valerie.

389
00:21:29,529 --> 00:21:30,757
Oh, hi, Valerie, what's up?

390
00:21:30,929 --> 00:21:33,568
l'll tell you what's up.
My stepmother is violently ill...

391
00:21:33,729 --> 00:21:36,289
...so l hit the button for Poison Control
and l get you.

392
00:21:36,449 --> 00:21:40,158
Wow, Poison Control.
That's even higher than number one.

393
00:21:42,729 --> 00:21:44,367
Hello?
