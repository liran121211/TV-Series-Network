1
00:00:04,077 --> 00:00:05,271
-Morning.
-Morning.

2
00:00:05,517 --> 00:00:07,553
l hope you don't mind
baking-soda flavour.

3
00:00:07,717 --> 00:00:09,673
Baking soda,
annoying little product.

4
00:00:09,837 --> 00:00:13,193
'' l can do this, l can do that.''
Why doesn't the stuff just shut up?

5
00:00:13,437 --> 00:00:14,552
Let me grab you a towel.

6
00:00:49,197 --> 00:00:51,791
-So?
-So? She used the toothbrush.

7
00:00:51,957 --> 00:00:54,425
-You grabbed it out of there real fast?
-Yeah.

8
00:00:54,597 --> 00:00:57,065
l'm sure whatever germs
it landed on were knocked out.

9
00:00:57,237 --> 00:00:59,068
When the rest realized
what was going on...

10
00:00:59,237 --> 00:01:00,716
...you had already grabbed it out.

11
00:01:00,877 --> 00:01:02,754
How many years of med school
did you have?

12
00:01:02,917 --> 00:01:04,111
Was she mad?

13
00:01:06,157 --> 00:01:08,591
-You didn't tell her.
-Jenna's like me. She's very....

14
00:01:08,837 --> 00:01:12,273
Finicky? Prissy? Fastidious?

15
00:01:12,437 --> 00:01:13,665
l'll take ''fastidious.''

16
00:01:15,077 --> 00:01:16,271
What is that?

17
00:01:17,917 --> 00:01:19,316
Steinbrenner gave them to us.

18
00:01:19,477 --> 00:01:21,707
For Phil Rizzuto's
induction to the Hall of Fame.

19
00:01:21,877 --> 00:01:23,629
Holy cow.

20
00:01:25,037 --> 00:01:28,109
Do they have to squeeze his head
to get him to say '' Holy cow''?

21
00:01:28,757 --> 00:01:30,907
Just the last few innings
of a double-header.

22
00:01:31,597 --> 00:01:32,825
Hey.

23
00:01:32,997 --> 00:01:34,066
Look at this.

24
00:01:34,237 --> 00:01:36,876
l'm in the passing lane of
the Arthur Berkhardt Expressway...

25
00:01:37,037 --> 00:01:39,312
...going 7 0, and:

26
00:01:41,397 --> 00:01:44,036
Dragged this thing for five exits.

27
00:01:44,197 --> 00:01:45,550
Why didn't you pull over?

28
00:01:45,717 --> 00:01:48,868
Well, l was drafting behind a semi.
l didn't wanna lose him.

29
00:01:49,037 --> 00:01:51,790
The infrastructure, Jerry,
it's crumbling.

30
00:01:52,397 --> 00:01:53,546
Holy cow.

31
00:01:54,077 --> 00:01:57,387
Oh, look at that. Talking Nixon.

32
00:01:59,797 --> 00:02:02,265
-China Panda.
-Yeah, l'd like to place an order.

33
00:02:02,437 --> 00:02:03,586
Yes, what you like?

34
00:02:03,917 --> 00:02:07,148
This supreme flounder, it says
'' First time served in America.''

35
00:02:07,317 --> 00:02:08,989
-ls that true?
-What number?

36
00:02:09,157 --> 00:02:12,433
-Forty-seven?
-Yeah, first time. What else?

37
00:02:14,037 --> 00:02:15,789
-That's it.
-Address.

38
00:02:15,957 --> 00:02:18,425
78 West 86th Street, apartment 3E.

39
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:21,669
That's south side.
Sorry, we don't deliver below 86.

40
00:02:21,837 --> 00:02:24,032
-l'm not below.
-Yes, you are.

41
00:02:24,197 --> 00:02:27,473
-Street itself is boundary.
-Your guy can't cross to my side?

42
00:02:27,637 --> 00:02:29,434
lf we deliver to you, then what?

43
00:02:29,597 --> 00:02:33,033
85th Street? Wall Street?
Mexico? 84th Street?

44
00:02:33,197 --> 00:02:36,269
All right, fine.
l'll just cross and meet him.

45
00:02:36,437 --> 00:02:39,793
Sorry. Food only for those
who live within boundary.

46
00:02:47,477 --> 00:02:49,388
-China Panda.
-Yeah, yeah.

47
00:02:49,557 --> 00:02:51,946
l'd like to place an order.

48
00:02:52,117 --> 00:02:53,550
What you like?

49
00:02:58,357 --> 00:03:00,268
Well, l'm a papa.

50
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,667
Bring it on.
Nothing's throwing me at this point.

51
00:03:02,837 --> 00:03:04,748
Well, as of today,
l am a proud parent...

52
00:03:04,917 --> 00:03:07,636
...of a one-mile stretch
of the Arthur Berkhardt Expressway.

53
00:03:07,797 --> 00:03:11,107
-Oh, that Adopt-A-Highway thing.
-l'm part of the solution now, Jerry.

54
00:03:11,517 --> 00:03:13,826
l went down there
and l checked it out this morning.

55
00:03:13,997 --> 00:03:17,956
-Here, take a look. Mile 1 1 4.
-Oh, looks just like you.

56
00:03:18,117 --> 00:03:19,311
Oh, l'm beaming, Jerry.

57
00:03:19,837 --> 00:03:21,509
What do you do?
Pay to keep it clean?

58
00:03:21,677 --> 00:03:24,191
No. They try to push you into
using their cleaning crew...

59
00:03:24,357 --> 00:03:26,507
...with all their so-called
maintenance equipment.

60
00:03:26,677 --> 00:03:29,066
-That old scam.
-That's why l'm doing it all myself.

61
00:03:29,237 --> 00:03:31,626
This parenting isn't about
delegating responsibility...

62
00:03:31,797 --> 00:03:32,912
...it's about being there.

63
00:03:33,077 --> 00:03:35,147
At the side of the road
with a pile of garbage.

64
00:03:35,317 --> 00:03:36,545
Quality time.

65
00:03:37,357 --> 00:03:41,066
-Keys. l can't find my keys.
-You lost Phil Rizzuto's head?

66
00:03:41,357 --> 00:03:42,426
-Have you seen him?
-No.

67
00:03:42,837 --> 00:03:44,475
-Damn it.
-Come on, retrace your steps.

68
00:03:44,637 --> 00:03:46,070
-What'd you do today?
-l got up...

69
00:03:46,237 --> 00:03:48,512
...l was supposed to go to work,
l came here instead.

70
00:03:48,877 --> 00:03:51,266
They're not here.
You'll have to dig up your spare set.

71
00:03:51,437 --> 00:03:54,827
l don't have a spare set.
All my keys say ''do not duplicate.''

72
00:03:54,997 --> 00:03:58,672
-So?
-So you can't duplicate them.

73
00:03:59,477 --> 00:04:03,311
Sure you can. Such a sweet kid.

74
00:04:12,077 --> 00:04:14,830
Oh, hi. China Panda?

75
00:04:15,477 --> 00:04:18,355
Why are you waiting on the street
and not in your apartment?

76
00:04:18,517 --> 00:04:21,668
l thought that l would
meet you halfway.

77
00:04:23,157 --> 00:04:24,909
-Do you really live here?
-Oh, yeah.

78
00:04:25,077 --> 00:04:28,433
There you go. You keep the change.
Bye, now.

79
00:04:29,557 --> 00:04:31,468
l'll see you.

80
00:04:46,837 --> 00:04:51,308
You know, this isn't fair.
This is address discrimination.

81
00:04:52,877 --> 00:04:55,152
Well, l cleaned out their whole
dental-hygiene shelf.

82
00:04:55,477 --> 00:04:57,672
So the plan is to secretly
sterilize her mouth?

83
00:04:57,837 --> 00:05:00,635
When l'm through with her mouth,
she'll be able to eat off it.

84
00:05:00,797 --> 00:05:02,753
ls it safe to drink bleach
if you dilute it?

85
00:05:02,917 --> 00:05:05,715
No. Stings the throat. Anyway,
so l was coming along here.

86
00:05:06,077 --> 00:05:07,795
l felt like a piece of cake,
you know?

87
00:05:07,957 --> 00:05:10,755
So then l thought, '' lt's morning,
l should really have a muffin.''

88
00:05:10,917 --> 00:05:12,350
l like those chocolate-chip ones.

89
00:05:12,517 --> 00:05:14,985
Then l figured, well,
they're really both cake.

90
00:05:15,157 --> 00:05:18,467
So l sat on that bench for a little while,
20 minutes or an hour...

91
00:05:18,637 --> 00:05:21,470
...and then l figured l'd check
and see what you were up to.

92
00:05:22,237 --> 00:05:25,593
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
The broad jump.

93
00:05:25,757 --> 00:05:28,749
The broad jump over the pothole
on 86th Street.

94
00:05:29,637 --> 00:05:31,355
l remember.
As l jumped over the hole...

95
00:05:31,517 --> 00:05:34,031
-...l heard a jingling sound.
-You didn't look down?

96
00:05:34,197 --> 00:05:38,076
l was trying to stick the landing.
l know it was right around here.

97
00:05:38,957 --> 00:05:41,027
No. No!

98
00:05:41,477 --> 00:05:43,786
Holy-- Holy cow.

99
00:05:44,597 --> 00:05:46,827
Poor son of a bitch.

100
00:05:48,437 --> 00:05:50,348
lt's 1 00,000 revolutions a second.

101
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:54,510
-lt's the most powerful one they make.
-l feel like l'm holding a blender.

102
00:05:54,677 --> 00:05:57,475
The engine's made
by McDonnell Douglas.

103
00:05:57,637 --> 00:05:59,946
No, no, you keep going.
lt shuts off automatically.

104
00:06:00,117 --> 00:06:01,869
Really? lt does?

105
00:06:02,037 --> 00:06:04,312
When the battery runs out.

106
00:06:05,277 --> 00:06:07,791
l was really happy
with my old toothbrush.

107
00:06:07,957 --> 00:06:11,472
Oh, trust me, that one was doing
more harm than good.

108
00:06:12,757 --> 00:06:15,430
Don't forget to use the Plax too.

109
00:06:17,037 --> 00:06:21,110
-That stuff tastes like bleach.
-l don't know anything about that.

110
00:06:24,077 --> 00:06:27,786
-My mouth feels so clean.
-That's the idea.

111
00:06:36,677 --> 00:06:39,749
You know, maybe we better not.
l think l'm getting a little cold.

112
00:06:39,917 --> 00:06:41,794
l don't wanna give you
any of my germs.

113
00:06:42,917 --> 00:06:45,954
Okay. Thanks, l guess.

114
00:06:48,837 --> 00:06:50,475
You still couldn't kiss her?

115
00:06:50,637 --> 00:06:53,515
She has a taint. l can't see it,
but l know it's there.

116
00:06:53,837 --> 00:06:57,147
Oh, so now you're finding fault
on a subatomic level.

117
00:06:57,317 --> 00:07:00,070
Maybe if l could shrink myself down,
like in Fantastic Voyage...

118
00:07:00,237 --> 00:07:02,797
...and get inside a microscopic
submarine, l could be sure.

119
00:07:02,957 --> 00:07:05,710
Although if there was something there,
it might be pretty scary.

120
00:07:05,877 --> 00:07:08,107
Of course, l would have that laser.

121
00:07:09,117 --> 00:07:11,950
Jer, do you see where this is going?

122
00:07:12,237 --> 00:07:14,034
Being really clean and happy?

123
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:17,554
Jerry, you have tendencies.

124
00:07:17,717 --> 00:07:21,266
They were always annoying,
but they were just tendencies.

125
00:07:21,437 --> 00:07:25,715
But now, if you can't kiss this girl,
l'm afraid we're talking disorder.

126
00:07:25,877 --> 00:07:27,754
-Disorder?
-And from disorder...

127
00:07:27,917 --> 00:07:32,433
...you're a quirk or two away
from full-on dementia.

128
00:07:33,437 --> 00:07:34,995
That could hurt me.

129
00:07:35,757 --> 00:07:36,906
Hey, there it is.

130
00:07:40,117 --> 00:07:41,516
Should we stop and say hi?

131
00:07:41,677 --> 00:07:43,429
-No, we've seen it.
-Yeah.

132
00:07:44,117 --> 00:07:47,951
Hey, Jerry! Yeah, l'll see you
back at the house.

133
00:07:52,037 --> 00:07:55,825
Mile 1 1 4, clean as a whistle.

134
00:08:19,797 --> 00:08:20,912
-Yeah?
-Hi.

135
00:08:21,597 --> 00:08:23,474
l'm your neighbour...

136
00:08:23,797 --> 00:08:25,150
...from across the street.

137
00:08:26,997 --> 00:08:29,386
l was wondering if it wouldn't
be too much trouble...

138
00:08:29,557 --> 00:08:33,470
...if l could use your apartment
to order some food.

139
00:08:33,637 --> 00:08:34,990
What? What do you want?

140
00:08:35,157 --> 00:08:36,954
You see, there's this
certain flounder...

141
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:40,393
...and they won't deliver it
to my side of the street.

142
00:08:40,757 --> 00:08:42,031
When is that?

143
00:08:42,957 --> 00:08:45,152
No, l just need them
to deliver it here...

144
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:48,070
...and l have to be
kind of inside, is all.

145
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:49,465
Who are you with?

146
00:08:50,157 --> 00:08:53,706
No, actually, l'm just kind of hungry.

147
00:08:53,877 --> 00:08:56,835
-Who let you in?
-Well, the lock was broken.

148
00:08:56,997 --> 00:08:59,557
You just have to jiggle it,
actually, to get-- But--

149
00:08:59,717 --> 00:09:02,993
l just need like half an hour
to an hour.

150
00:09:15,877 --> 00:09:17,230
What's with the signs?

151
00:09:17,397 --> 00:09:19,308
You should see the Berkhardt,
Jerry.

152
00:09:19,477 --> 00:09:21,866
My mile is spotless.
l mean, the big stuff was easy:

153
00:09:22,037 --> 00:09:24,995
Cinder blocks, air conditioners,
shopping carts.

154
00:09:25,157 --> 00:09:28,911
-l just rolled them into the woods.
-Yeah, that stuff's all natural anyway.

155
00:09:30,757 --> 00:09:33,715
Speed limit, 1 65 miles per hour.

156
00:09:33,877 --> 00:09:35,788
See? They slipped a one in there.

157
00:09:35,957 --> 00:09:39,745
Those kids with the spray paint,
God love them.

158
00:09:42,557 --> 00:09:43,626
Hey, so? Keys?

159
00:09:43,797 --> 00:09:46,072
No keys. And l've been
calling the city all day.

160
00:09:46,237 --> 00:09:48,432
There's no one to call
if you wanna make a pothole.

161
00:09:48,597 --> 00:09:50,633
They leave that
to the general population.

162
00:09:50,997 --> 00:09:54,672
l'll tell you, if the real Phil Rizzuto was
down there this wouldn't be happening.

163
00:09:54,837 --> 00:09:57,715
-Hard to say.
-You need some roadwork done?

164
00:09:57,877 --> 00:09:59,947
l met some maintenance guys
today on the highway.

165
00:10:00,117 --> 00:10:02,073
-They could probably help you out.
-Really?

166
00:10:02,237 --> 00:10:04,114
Oh, yeah. l borrowed some cones
from them...

167
00:10:04,277 --> 00:10:06,837
...when l was sweeping
my car-pool lane.

168
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:08,756
-Yeah?
-It's Jenna.

169
00:10:09,557 --> 00:10:13,072
lf you guys wouldn't mind,
l would like to ward off dementia.

170
00:10:14,117 --> 00:10:16,870
-You can hook me up with them?
-Yeah. Give me a ring tomorrow.

171
00:10:17,037 --> 00:10:19,153
l'm gonna be
at emergency call box 784.

172
00:10:19,317 --> 00:10:20,830
Seven-eight-four.

173
00:10:20,997 --> 00:10:22,191
-Hey.
-Hi.

174
00:10:22,357 --> 00:10:23,710
-How you feeling?
-Good.

175
00:10:24,117 --> 00:10:26,677
My cold's gone. l've been
looking forward to kissing you...

176
00:10:26,837 --> 00:10:29,556
...which l'm ready to do now,
if you are ready.

177
00:10:29,717 --> 00:10:31,389
Okay.

178
00:10:36,157 --> 00:10:38,352
-What?
-Nothing, l just--

179
00:10:38,517 --> 00:10:40,553
l bruised my lip.
l was drinking a Cel-Ray...

180
00:10:40,717 --> 00:10:43,470
...and l brought it up too fast
and l banged it into my lip.

181
00:10:43,637 --> 00:10:45,867
And then l knocked your toothbrush
into the toilet.

182
00:10:46,037 --> 00:10:48,346
And l wasn't able to tell you
before you could use it.

183
00:10:48,517 --> 00:10:50,348
-What?
-l'm sorry.

184
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:53,350
-When were you gonna tell me this?
-Obviously never.

185
00:10:54,797 --> 00:10:56,116
l need the ''yield'' sign.

186
00:10:56,277 --> 00:10:59,553
Kramer, l'm kind of in the middle
of something.

187
00:10:59,717 --> 00:11:02,993
Would you get these signs
out of here, please?

188
00:11:04,717 --> 00:11:07,789
-You could have introduced me.
-l wouldn't know where to start.

189
00:11:10,357 --> 00:11:13,633
Hey. Jenna. Hey.

190
00:11:14,997 --> 00:11:18,592
There. Now something of yours
has been in the toilet.

191
00:11:18,877 --> 00:11:21,152
What? Well, what did you
put in there?

192
00:11:21,317 --> 00:11:23,114
Gotta run.

193
00:11:26,757 --> 00:11:28,907
Oh, man.

194
00:11:33,557 --> 00:11:35,275
Hello, Jenna?
Did you dunk the spatula?

195
00:11:35,437 --> 00:11:37,792
Was it the spatula? Hello?

196
00:11:37,957 --> 00:11:39,470
Damn it.

197
00:11:40,757 --> 00:11:42,031
Didn't even give you a hint?

198
00:11:42,197 --> 00:11:44,757
No, could be anything.
The whole apartment's a biohazard.

199
00:11:45,397 --> 00:11:47,627
You know what l bet it is?
Your remote.

200
00:11:48,117 --> 00:11:50,995
Yes, that is a definite possibility.

201
00:11:51,717 --> 00:11:53,389
Or it could be your Walkman there.

202
00:11:55,637 --> 00:11:57,946
-Are you just screwing with me?
-Yeah, l am.

203
00:11:59,997 --> 00:12:01,271
-Hey.
-How's life on the road?

204
00:12:01,437 --> 00:12:03,632
-l'm making a difference, Jerry.
-l don't doubt it.

205
00:12:03,797 --> 00:12:06,027
You should see the smiles
on the drivers' faces.

206
00:12:06,197 --> 00:12:08,427
l mean, you gotta look quick,
but they're there.

207
00:12:08,957 --> 00:12:10,515
-This.
-What's this?

208
00:12:10,677 --> 00:12:13,589
You know those annoying little bumps
on the lane lines?

209
00:12:15,757 --> 00:12:17,395
lsn't that some kind of safety thing?

210
00:12:17,557 --> 00:12:20,117
Well, l had to pull them up
if l'm gonna widen the lanes.

211
00:12:21,277 --> 00:12:22,630
What are you talking about?

212
00:12:22,797 --> 00:12:25,709
Well, you know how in planes
they got first class?

213
00:12:25,877 --> 00:12:27,151
More legroom, better ride?

214
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:29,877
Well, l'm bringing that concept
to mile 1 1 4.

215
00:12:30,037 --> 00:12:32,107
How are you gonna
widen the lanes?

216
00:12:32,277 --> 00:12:34,233
You black out lane lines
one and three...

217
00:12:34,397 --> 00:12:38,515
...and a four-lane highway
becomes a two-lane comfort cruise.

218
00:12:38,677 --> 00:12:39,951
So you got any black paint?

219
00:12:40,117 --> 00:12:42,836
Yeah, in my tool shed,
next to the riding mower.

220
00:12:42,997 --> 00:12:48,151
Yeah, l'd like an order
of supreme flounder, number 47.

221
00:12:48,317 --> 00:12:50,956
Yeah, apartment 1 Q.

222
00:12:51,117 --> 00:12:52,914
1 Q? Whose apartment is that?

223
00:12:53,077 --> 00:12:55,147
That's the janitor closet...

224
00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:57,194
...across the street.

225
00:12:57,357 --> 00:13:00,588
You're pretending to live in a janitor's
closet just to get this flounder?

226
00:13:00,757 --> 00:13:04,909
lt's better than eating it alone
in the restaurant like some loser.

227
00:13:06,197 --> 00:13:10,190
That stuff is unbelievable.
l'd eat it out of a dumpster.

228
00:13:10,477 --> 00:13:13,071
How do you know about it?
You're not in the delivery zone.

229
00:13:13,237 --> 00:13:14,590
Newman uses his mail truck...

230
00:13:14,757 --> 00:13:16,748
...to run fish for China Panda
on the weekends.

231
00:13:16,917 --> 00:13:20,592
Well, mine's coming in 1 0,
so l'll see you boys.

232
00:13:21,877 --> 00:13:24,437
Now, where's that tool shed
of yours?

233
00:13:33,237 --> 00:13:36,274
Hi. Sorry, l didn't hear you.
l was in the shower.

234
00:13:37,477 --> 00:13:38,671
l'll see you.

235
00:13:41,557 --> 00:13:43,309
-You Costanza?
-Yeah.

236
00:13:43,477 --> 00:13:45,069
Thanks for coming by, fellas.

237
00:13:45,237 --> 00:13:49,071
Yeah, got a set of keys
buried in the pothole.

238
00:13:49,397 --> 00:13:53,231
-What are the keys doing in there?
-Just need to dig them up.

239
00:13:53,397 --> 00:13:57,026
-You put them in there?
-No, no. lt's a long story.

240
00:13:57,197 --> 00:13:59,791
Just try to get it up.

241
00:13:59,957 --> 00:14:03,586
-Bad place to put your keys.
-Yeah, l know that.

242
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:08,228
-Could you start working?
-Difficult job.

243
00:14:08,397 --> 00:14:10,911
lf you want those keys,
we're gonna have to dig this up.

244
00:14:12,437 --> 00:14:16,271
Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.

245
00:14:16,437 --> 00:14:20,589
-ls this about money?
-Yeah, it's about money.

246
00:14:38,357 --> 00:14:40,587
Excuse me,
what are you doing in there?

247
00:14:41,077 --> 00:14:43,386
Nothing, l was just....

248
00:14:43,997 --> 00:14:45,396
l wasn't in there.

249
00:14:45,557 --> 00:14:48,629
You were hanging around in there,
lazing on the job...

250
00:14:48,797 --> 00:14:51,311
...when you should have been
downstairs in the basement...

251
00:14:51,477 --> 00:14:53,547
...cleaning out those old carpets
and scrap wood.

252
00:14:53,717 --> 00:14:56,277
Right, because...

253
00:14:57,077 --> 00:14:58,669
...l'm the janitor.

254
00:14:58,837 --> 00:15:02,910
-Don't get smart with me.
-Yes, ma'am.

255
00:15:05,517 --> 00:15:07,553
If you're north
on the Arthur Berkhardt...

256
00:15:07,717 --> 00:15:09,230
... whoa, Nellie. For some reason...

257
00:15:09,397 --> 00:15:11,672
... four lanes are converging
into two...

258
00:15:11,837 --> 00:15:13,316
...right at mile mark er 1 1 4.

259
00:15:13,477 --> 00:15:16,469
I don't know what that is,
but the A.B.E. 's a parking lot out there.

260
00:15:16,637 --> 00:15:19,151
Somebody screwed up on that one.

261
00:15:25,397 --> 00:15:27,467
-Oh, it's you.
-ls the flounder here yet?

262
00:15:27,637 --> 00:15:30,026
No, it's not here yet.
You want the tour?

263
00:15:37,077 --> 00:15:38,669
There's this.

264
00:15:39,317 --> 00:15:42,036
Nice. French doors would
really open this place up.

265
00:15:42,197 --> 00:15:44,552
Oh, but you have a slop bucket.

266
00:15:46,197 --> 00:15:48,188
The fish.

267
00:15:50,757 --> 00:15:52,031
-What are you doing here?
-Hey.

268
00:15:52,197 --> 00:15:54,108
-Hey.
-Oh, l was--

269
00:15:54,277 --> 00:15:56,268
l was waiting downstairs
for the jackhammer.

270
00:15:56,437 --> 00:15:58,997
-l just thought l'd drop by.
-Kramer's guys?

271
00:15:59,157 --> 00:16:00,636
Yeah. l got them down to 50 bucks.

272
00:16:00,797 --> 00:16:02,674
l just have to do
all the jackhammering.

273
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:06,068
Oh, that's nice, kind of
a hard-labour fantasy camp.

274
00:16:11,477 --> 00:16:12,876
Oh, yeah.

275
00:16:14,037 --> 00:16:16,597
Oh, sweet setup.

276
00:16:16,757 --> 00:16:20,272
Look, Elaine, do you have any
paint thinner? l need like 40 gallons.

277
00:16:20,957 --> 00:16:23,391
-l'm plumb out.
-Oh, damn.

278
00:16:23,557 --> 00:16:26,196
lf l don't get that black paint off,
the city's gonna go ape.

279
00:16:26,357 --> 00:16:28,746
l don't wanna lose my baby.

280
00:16:29,037 --> 00:16:31,312
-Janitor.
-lt's Mrs. Allister.

281
00:16:31,477 --> 00:16:34,150
Yeah. Yes, coming, Mrs. Allister.
Okay, l've gotta get out.

282
00:16:34,317 --> 00:16:38,105
Let's go. Let's go. Here. Can you--?
You gotta move from the door.

283
00:16:42,997 --> 00:16:44,350
Hi.

284
00:16:45,357 --> 00:16:47,313
l-- What can l do for you?

285
00:16:47,477 --> 00:16:51,106
l told you yesterday to haul that trash
out of the basement.

286
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:52,596
Yeah, l am so sorry.

287
00:16:52,757 --> 00:16:54,588
The children
have been playing near it...

288
00:16:54,757 --> 00:16:56,349
...and putting it in their mouth.

289
00:16:56,757 --> 00:16:59,225
Well, a lot of it is vegetables.

290
00:17:02,117 --> 00:17:03,869
You mop it.

291
00:17:05,797 --> 00:17:10,473
Get that stuff out of there today,
or you'll be out of here, understand?

292
00:17:10,837 --> 00:17:13,397
-Yes, ma'am.
-Stop pushing.

293
00:17:13,557 --> 00:17:16,993
-Kramer spilled ammonia.
-l don't feel like eating.

294
00:17:17,157 --> 00:17:19,466
l'm gonna borrow this, huh?

295
00:17:21,397 --> 00:17:23,592
Janitors' meeting.

296
00:17:24,797 --> 00:17:27,470
So, Jerry, why'd you call me?

297
00:17:27,637 --> 00:17:30,674
Well, l thought it's about time
we put aside all this silliness.

298
00:17:30,837 --> 00:17:34,386
l know now that you didn't put
anything in my toilet bowl.

299
00:17:34,557 --> 00:17:37,230
-Did you?
-Yes, l did.

300
00:17:37,397 --> 00:17:39,786
Well, whatever.
So how have you been?

301
00:17:39,957 --> 00:17:41,868
-Good.
-Good.

302
00:17:43,477 --> 00:17:44,956
Steak knife?

303
00:17:45,117 --> 00:17:47,472
-lt's just eating away at you, isn't it?
-No.

304
00:17:48,597 --> 00:17:49,791
-Hi.
-Hi.

305
00:17:49,957 --> 00:17:51,948
-Hi.
-Hi. Jerry, can l borrow your car?

306
00:17:52,117 --> 00:17:53,266
For what?

307
00:17:53,437 --> 00:17:55,473
l have to haul some dirty garbage
to the dump.

308
00:17:55,637 --> 00:17:58,515
Dirt? That's all right, because
there's nothing wrong with dirt.

309
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:00,349
Well, actually, it's pretty grimy.

310
00:18:00,517 --> 00:18:03,475
Grime, grease, filth, funk, ooze,
whatever it is...

311
00:18:03,637 --> 00:18:08,427
...you take that stuff and put it
right on my leather upholstery.

312
00:18:09,557 --> 00:18:12,549
Well, l don't know who you are,
but thanks for the car.

313
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:14,514
-Sure. Bye.
-Bye.

314
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:16,315
-Bye.
-Bye.

315
00:18:17,157 --> 00:18:19,671
There, you see?
l just lent her my car...

316
00:18:19,837 --> 00:18:24,752
...and she's gonna fill it
with all sorts of....

317
00:18:24,917 --> 00:18:27,306
All right! You win.

318
00:18:27,477 --> 00:18:29,707
That car was my last
germfree sanctuary.

319
00:18:29,877 --> 00:18:31,230
l slept there last night.

320
00:18:31,397 --> 00:18:34,355
Now, for the love of God, please,
what is it? What is it?

321
00:18:34,597 --> 00:18:38,067
-Toilet brush.
-Toilet brush.

322
00:18:39,477 --> 00:18:43,436
-All right. l can replace that.
-You wanna order dinner?

323
00:18:43,597 --> 00:18:46,953
Yeah. Let's go to your place.

324
00:18:47,157 --> 00:18:49,387
Because l threw out all my dishes.

325
00:19:07,717 --> 00:19:11,187
That's true.
But l'll tell you this much:

326
00:19:11,357 --> 00:19:14,827
l am never going to let some
silly hygienic mishap...

327
00:19:14,997 --> 00:19:19,149
...get in the way of what could be a
meaningful, long-lasting relationship.

328
00:19:26,397 --> 00:19:27,625
Do you hear something?

329
00:19:30,357 --> 00:19:32,427
l don't know what that could be.

330
00:19:39,397 --> 00:19:41,752
Holy cow.

331
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,633
Anyway, l'm a new man...
