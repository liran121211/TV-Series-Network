1
00:00:06,619 --> 00:00:09,577
Say me, you and Kramer
are flying over the Andes.

2
00:00:09,739 --> 00:00:11,252
Why are we flying over the Andes?

3
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:14,491
We got a soccer game in Chile.
Anyway, the plane crashes.

4
00:00:14,659 --> 00:00:17,651
-Who are you gonna eat to survive?
-Kramer.

5
00:00:18,379 --> 00:00:21,371
-So fast? What about me?
-No.

6
00:00:22,299 --> 00:00:25,609
Kramer's so stringy. l'm plump, juicy.

7
00:00:25,779 --> 00:00:29,977
Kramer's got more muscle, higher
protein content. lt's better for you.

8
00:00:30,139 --> 00:00:34,052
-Well, l would eat you.
-That's very nice, l guess.

9
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:36,369
Why wouldn't you eat me?
l'm your best friend.

10
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:38,689
lf other people are having some,
l'll try you.

11
00:00:38,859 --> 00:00:40,372
Thank you.

12
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:43,174
-Can l have a piece of that?
-No.

13
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:52,178
George, l can't have sex.

14
00:00:56,059 --> 00:00:58,493
With me, or in general?

15
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:01,898
l went to the doctor today.
l have mono.

16
00:01:02,059 --> 00:01:03,811
Nucleosis?

17
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:07,369
-l hope that's not a problem for you.
-No, no.

18
00:01:08,699 --> 00:01:12,374
So how long is this not gonna be
a problem for me?

19
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:17,412
-Six weeks?
-Yeah, six weeks.

20
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:19,535
So what?
You've gone six weeks before.

21
00:01:19,699 --> 00:01:21,894
l can do six weeks
standing on my head.

22
00:01:22,699 --> 00:01:25,816
l'm like a sexual camel.
That's not the point.

23
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:28,015
At least there was the possibility.

24
00:01:28,179 --> 00:01:30,170
-You gonna break up with her?
-l don't know.

25
00:01:30,339 --> 00:01:32,534
-l don't wanna be one of those guys.
-What guys?

26
00:01:32,699 --> 00:01:34,610
Like us.

27
00:01:34,779 --> 00:01:37,577
-So it's just mono.
-Mono?

28
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:39,730
Well, if anybody needs
any medical advice...

29
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:43,812
...Laney met a doctor,
and he's unattached.

30
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,618
l thought the whole dream
of dating a doctor was debunked?

31
00:01:46,779 --> 00:01:50,135
No, it's not debunk. lt's totally bunk.

32
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:52,688
lsn't bunk bad?
Like, ''that's a lot of bunk''?

33
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:54,815
No, something is bunk,
then you debunk it.

34
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:57,254
-What?
-l think.

35
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:05,374
Lookit. l'm dating a doctor, and l like it.
Let's just move on.

36
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:09,012
-Hello. Oh, hi, Katie.
-Jerry.

37
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,773
Something came up for Tuesday
at the Dayton Civic Centre.

38
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:15,170
-That's Ohio, Jerry.
-l've heard of Ohio, Katie...

39
00:02:15,339 --> 00:02:18,331
...but Tuesday's no good.
l'm doing Career Day at my junior high.

40
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:19,813
Okay, Jerry, that's fine.

41
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:21,571
-All right.
-Katie works for Jerry.

42
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:24,811
-Yes, all right, Katie. Thank you. Yes.
-Sorry for the late notice.

43
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:26,697
-Bye. Bye.
-Okay, you're the--

44
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:32,537
-They asked you to do Career Day?
-Yeah, it's no big thing.

45
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:34,371
With due respect, l went there...

46
00:02:34,539 --> 00:02:36,609
...and l work for
a World Series-winning team.

47
00:02:36,779 --> 00:02:38,576
And you were integral.

48
00:02:45,259 --> 00:02:48,888
Jerry, so nice of you
to come down here.

49
00:02:49,059 --> 00:02:50,208
l'm on next, right?

50
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:54,418
Well, unfortunately, Mr. Amiry,
from the Bronx Zoo....

51
00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:57,651
-The guy with the lizard?
-Yes.

52
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:02,574
Well, he started feeding it crickets,
and the children just love him...

53
00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:04,297
...and we're out of time.

54
00:03:06,499 --> 00:03:08,933
So can you come back tomorrow?

55
00:03:09,499 --> 00:03:14,015
l'm getting bumped?
You're bumping me from Career Day?

56
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:19,448
So do most doctors like ER,
or do you guys just think it's fake?

57
00:03:19,619 --> 00:03:22,531
l couldn't tell you.
You know, l'm not really a doctor.

58
00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:24,417
Then l'm not really attracted you.

59
00:03:27,859 --> 00:03:29,850
l'm serious, Elaine.
l went to med school...

60
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:32,852
...but l still have to pass
my licensing exam.

61
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:34,892
When do you take this exam?

62
00:03:35,059 --> 00:03:39,257
l've taken it three times.
l almost passed the last one.

63
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:43,173
But you're basically a doctor.
l mean, people do call you doctor?

64
00:03:43,339 --> 00:03:45,978
-Well....
-Can l introduce you as doctor?

65
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:48,812
-Yeah.
-All right. That's all l wanted to know.

66
00:03:50,899 --> 00:03:52,298
Mono.

67
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:56,208
lt was fantastic.

68
00:03:56,379 --> 00:03:59,530
-We wound up talking all night.
-You're enjoying the not enjoying.

69
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:03,931
You know, just by conversing, you can
really learn a lot about a person.

70
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:05,612
l'm finding that out.

71
00:04:06,259 --> 00:04:07,453
-Hey, buddy.
-Hey.

72
00:04:07,619 --> 00:04:08,813
How was Career Day?

73
00:04:08,979 --> 00:04:12,335
l didn't get on.
The lizard guy went long.

74
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:17,615
-You got bumped from Career Day?
-lt was a mix-up, l'm sure.

75
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:21,177
Sounds like they're trying to
screw with your head.

76
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:25,048
Now, why would a junior high school
wanna screw with my head?

77
00:04:25,219 --> 00:04:27,494
Why does Radio Shack
ask for your phone number...

78
00:04:27,659 --> 00:04:29,809
...when you buy batteries?

79
00:04:31,299 --> 00:04:33,051
l don't know.

80
00:04:35,499 --> 00:04:37,615
Hey, hey.
Kramer, what are you doing?

81
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:40,293
-You can't smoke in here.
-Oh, go on.

82
00:04:40,459 --> 00:04:45,214
-Hey, take it outside.
-Come on, Larry. You know me.

83
00:04:45,379 --> 00:04:47,939
lt bothers people,
and it's against the law.

84
00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:51,375
You can make all the laws you want.
He's still gonna bother people.

85
00:04:59,979 --> 00:05:04,177
-What, did they kick you out too?
-Yeah, they kicked us all out.

86
00:05:07,499 --> 00:05:09,569
Thanks for coming back.
Graham cracker?

87
00:05:09,739 --> 00:05:11,411
No, let's just do it.

88
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:14,334
What? What is going on?
What is that about?

89
00:05:14,499 --> 00:05:18,208
Fire drill. Sorry.
Single file, everyone.

90
00:05:18,379 --> 00:05:21,849
-But l was promised a slot.
-Single file, Jerry.

91
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:30,492
Fire drill. You believe that?

92
00:05:30,659 --> 00:05:33,412
-Who is Pericles?
-Pericles is correct.

93
00:05:33,579 --> 00:05:35,615
Like fire in a school
is such a big deal.

94
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:39,010
-You got any matches?
-Middle drawer.

95
00:05:39,179 --> 00:05:41,010
Who is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle?

96
00:05:41,179 --> 00:05:43,090
We were looking for
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

97
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,533
Thanks.

98
00:05:45,819 --> 00:05:47,537
-Hello. Oh, hi, Katie.
-Jerry.

99
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:50,293
l heard what happened at the school.
They can't bump you.

100
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:54,054
-That is so unprofessional.
-Oh, relax, Katie. lt's not a problem.

101
00:05:54,219 --> 00:05:56,210
-What is Borax?
-Yes, you are right.

102
00:05:56,379 --> 00:05:57,812
They bump you in junior high...

103
00:05:57,979 --> 00:06:01,210
...next, you're being bumped in
high schools, colleges, trade schools.

104
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:03,973
Before you know it,
Letterman won't return your calls.

105
00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:06,734
-You got an ashtray?
-l don't have any ashtrays.

106
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:08,855
Cereal bowls.

107
00:06:09,019 --> 00:06:11,135
Jerry, don't freak out.
I'll tak e care of you.

108
00:06:11,299 --> 00:06:13,529
-Katie, don't--
-All right. Thanks.

109
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,967
What is tungsten or wolfram?

110
00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:26,615
ls this a repeat?

111
00:06:26,779 --> 00:06:29,418
No, no, no. Just lately
l've been thinking a lot clearer.

112
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:31,490
Like this afternoon--
What is chicken Kiev?

113
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:35,732
--l really enjoyed watching
a documentary with Louise.

114
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:38,129
Louise. That's what's doing it.

115
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:42,614
You're no longer preoccupied with sex,
so your mind is able to focus.

116
00:06:45,219 --> 00:06:48,177
-You think?
-Yeah. Let's say this is your brain.

117
00:06:48,339 --> 00:06:50,807
Okay?
Now, from what l know about you...

118
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:53,368
...your brain consists of two parts.

119
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:56,099
The intellect, represented here...

120
00:06:57,859 --> 00:07:00,293
...and the part obsessed with sex.

121
00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:02,888
Now, granted...

122
00:07:03,059 --> 00:07:07,371
...you have extracted an astonishing
amount from this little scrap.

123
00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:11,612
But with no-sex Louise,
this previously useless lump...

124
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:15,567
...is now functioning
for the first time in its existence.

125
00:07:18,299 --> 00:07:19,891
Oh, my God.

126
00:07:20,059 --> 00:07:23,210
l just remembered where l left
my retainer in second grade.

127
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:24,971
l'll see you later.

128
00:07:27,499 --> 00:07:31,208
-Hey, l need some more matches.
-What is going on in there?

129
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:33,370
l met some people smoking
on the street...

130
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:35,814
...so l invited them
up to my apartment to smoke.

131
00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:38,698
-Why?
-Somebody had to.

132
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:42,169
Just because a person's a smoker
doesn't mean he's not a human being.

133
00:07:42,339 --> 00:07:43,738
lt doesn't?

134
00:07:43,899 --> 00:07:46,333
These people aren't gonna
let themselves be flicked...

135
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:47,978
...into the ashbin of society.

136
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:50,369
-Why not?
-Well, you can confine them.

137
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:53,133
You can punish them.
You can cram them into the corner...

138
00:07:53,299 --> 00:07:55,017
...but they're not going away, Jerry.

139
00:07:56,219 --> 00:08:00,098
-All right.
-Yeah.

140
00:08:01,579 --> 00:08:03,217
When they hand out
those cadavers...

141
00:08:03,379 --> 00:08:05,256
...do you choose if it's a man
or woman?

142
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:08,297
l don't know.
Dead bodies really gross me out.

143
00:08:10,339 --> 00:08:12,216
-Oh, my God.
-What's wrong?

144
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:16,452
Oh, it's Sue Ellen Mischke,
this old braless friend l hate.

145
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:20,415
-Elaine? Hi.
-Oh, hi, Sue Ellen, hi.

146
00:08:20,619 --> 00:08:25,090
Oh, Rick, this is an old,
old friend of mine. Elaine Benes.

147
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:28,535
Rick is a periodontist.
He does Giuliani's gums.

148
00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:32,127
Well, this is my boyfriend,
Dr. Ben Galvant.

149
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:35,769
-Oh, well, l'm an intern.
-Hey, stop kidding, Ben.

150
00:08:37,699 --> 00:08:41,055
He's a doctor.
He's a very good doctor.

151
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:44,177
Carlito's just passed out.
Can anyone help?

152
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:48,127
-Oh, there's a doctor right here.
-No, there's not.

153
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:50,335
Can't you at least tell them
what to do?

154
00:08:50,499 --> 00:08:52,933
-Like what?
-Shouldn't he elevate his legs?

155
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:55,767
Right. Elevate your legs.

156
00:09:01,979 --> 00:09:04,652
l hope Carlito feels better.

157
00:09:04,819 --> 00:09:08,368
-Ben really wishes he could've helped.
-l thought he was a doctor.

158
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:10,131
Oh, he is.

159
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:12,250
You know, kind of.

160
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:15,970
l mean, l call him doctor.

161
00:09:20,419 --> 00:09:21,932
George.

162
00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:27,409
Of course, absolute zero.

163
00:09:30,939 --> 00:09:34,488
-What? What is with all these books?
-l stopped having sex.

164
00:09:37,699 --> 00:09:40,213
All right. l'll see you, Phil.
l've got room for two...

165
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:43,496
...but the only thing l have
is in the non-filter section.

166
00:09:43,699 --> 00:09:44,893
Hey, hey, how you doing?

167
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:47,050
What, you got
a smokers' lounge in there?

168
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:49,733
Oh, yeah, people really seem
to be enjoying themselves.

169
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:52,811
You know, they come in once,
it's like they're addicted.

170
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:57,938
Jerry. Oh, there you are.
You didn't answer your phone.

171
00:09:58,099 --> 00:10:00,169
l was out.

172
00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:02,409
Jerry, great news.

173
00:10:02,579 --> 00:10:07,209
-l got you an assembly.
-An assembly?

174
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:11,328
Two hours in front of the entire
junior high, grades six through eight.

175
00:10:11,499 --> 00:10:13,933
-That's sixth grade, seventh grade--
-l understand.

176
00:10:14,099 --> 00:10:16,567
But what am l gonna talk about
for two hours?

177
00:10:16,739 --> 00:10:20,618
And it is already in the school paper.
They cancelled Rick James.

178
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:24,409
-''Super Freak''?
-Yes.

179
00:10:24,579 --> 00:10:27,298
What is your answer to number 7 4?

180
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:31,008
-Metabolic acidosis.
-No.

181
00:10:31,179 --> 00:10:33,818
Hypokalemia.

182
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:36,175
Not metabolic acidosis.

183
00:10:38,539 --> 00:10:41,007
Oh, man,
l'm never gonna pass this thing.

184
00:10:41,179 --> 00:10:44,967
Oh, yes, you are.
We'll just stop having sex.

185
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:50,970
You guys. Hitting is not about muscle.
lt's simple physics.

186
00:10:51,139 --> 00:10:54,176
Calculate the velocity, V,
in relation to the trajectory, T...

187
00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:57,376
...in which, G, gravity, of course,
remains a constant.

188
00:11:02,019 --> 00:11:04,408
-lt's not complicated.
-Now, who are you again?

189
00:11:04,579 --> 00:11:08,413
George Costanza,
assistant to the travelling secretary.

190
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:12,690
Are you the guy who put us
in that Ramada in Milwaukee?

191
00:11:12,859 --> 00:11:15,692
You wanna talk about hotels,
or you wanna win some ball games?

192
00:11:15,859 --> 00:11:17,292
Hey, we won the World Series.

193
00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:20,016
ln six games.

194
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:29,416
So if you like to tell jokes,
and you love to make people laugh...

195
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:32,969
...stand-up comedy may be
the career for you.

196
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,337
Thank you.

197
00:11:41,979 --> 00:11:43,890
Nine minutes.

198
00:11:45,099 --> 00:11:46,612
How am l gonna fill two hours?

199
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:49,577
Hello? l could take an hour
off your hands.

200
00:11:49,739 --> 00:11:51,616
Let the kids see a real, live Yankee.

201
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:54,691
And give you the chance to see
some real disappointed kids.

202
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:58,692
Yes, l take your order, please?

203
00:11:58,859 --> 00:12:02,090
Excuse me, darling, do l--?
Do l detect a Portuguese accent?

204
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:12,051
No, don't mention it.

205
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:16,774
-Portuguese?
-Yeah, my cleaning lady is Portuguese.

206
00:12:16,939 --> 00:12:18,850
l must have picked it up.

207
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:21,010
How come he's getting so smart?

208
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:23,329
l stopped having sex with Ben
three days ago...

209
00:12:23,499 --> 00:12:25,808
...and l don't know no Portuguese.

210
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:31,497
-Are you all right?
-l don't know. l just--

211
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:35,538
The last couple of days my mind
has been kind of, you know...

212
00:12:40,859 --> 00:12:42,815
...not good.

213
00:12:42,979 --> 00:12:44,810
Wait a second.
l know what's happening.

214
00:12:44,979 --> 00:12:47,732
The no-sex thing is having
the reverse affect on you.

215
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:50,015
What? What are you talking about?

216
00:12:50,179 --> 00:12:52,090
To a woman,
sex is like the garbage man.

217
00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:55,296
You take for granted that when
you put some trash on the street...

218
00:12:55,459 --> 00:12:58,292
...a guy in a jumpsuit's gonna
come along and pick it up.

219
00:12:59,499 --> 00:13:02,935
But now, no sex,
it's like a garbage strike.

220
00:13:03,099 --> 00:13:06,933
The bags are piling up in your head.
The sidewalk is blocked.

221
00:13:07,099 --> 00:13:09,818
Nothing's getting through.
You're stupid.

222
00:13:09,979 --> 00:13:12,698
-l don't understand.
-Exactly.

223
00:13:18,939 --> 00:13:20,338
-Hey, buddy.
-Hey.

224
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:23,411
Hey, you should come over.
Tonight's pipe night.

225
00:13:24,939 --> 00:13:27,499
-What happened to your face?
-What?

226
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:30,412
lt looks like an old catcher's mitt.

227
00:13:31,219 --> 00:13:32,618
What?

228
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:42,017
Look at that.
My face is all craggily. lt's crinkly.

229
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:43,976
lt's from all that smoke.

230
00:13:44,139 --> 00:13:46,937
You've experienced a lifetime
of smoking in 7 2 hours.

231
00:13:47,099 --> 00:13:48,373
What did you expect?

232
00:13:48,859 --> 00:13:52,454
Emphysema, birth defects, cancer,
but not this.

233
00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:56,373
Jerry, you know,
my face is my livelihood.

234
00:13:59,179 --> 00:14:01,534
Everything l have l owe to this face.

235
00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:05,248
lt's my allure, my twinkle, you know.

236
00:14:05,859 --> 00:14:08,453
You know, and your teeth,
your teeth are all brown.

237
00:14:10,699 --> 00:14:13,259
Look away, l'm-- l'm hideous.

238
00:14:21,179 --> 00:14:25,172
Hey, Ben, l need a four-letter word.

239
00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:28,490
''Winnie-the-'' blank.

240
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:32,174
-Pooh.
-Poo.

241
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:37,848
No, it's Winnie-the-Pooh.

242
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:44,452
So the hospital called.

243
00:14:44,619 --> 00:14:47,577
Turns out some stupid intern
screwed up my test.

244
00:14:47,739 --> 00:14:49,969
l never had mono.

245
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,814
So now we can, you know.

246
00:15:00,459 --> 00:15:01,733
So, what did you do?

247
00:15:01,899 --> 00:15:04,254
l told her
l would have to think about it.

248
00:15:04,979 --> 00:15:08,096
But ultimately you're gonna choose
in favour of sex, right?

249
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:12,977
l don't know. Perhaps l can
better serve the world this way.

250
00:15:13,739 --> 00:15:17,095
You mean, not subjecting women
to your sexual advances?

251
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:21,054
A simple joke from a simple man.

252
00:15:22,579 --> 00:15:24,490
So you're never gonna
have sex again?

253
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:25,648
Well, Jerry...

254
00:15:25,819 --> 00:15:29,607
...there was a pretty good chance l was
never gonna have sex again anyway.

255
00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:32,771
You ready for the assembly
and what you'll say about the Yankees?

256
00:15:33,419 --> 00:15:36,411
Sports are so pedestrian.
l prepared some science experiments...

257
00:15:36,579 --> 00:15:39,377
...that will illuminate the mind
and dazzle the eye.

258
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:43,088
l wrote a 20-minute bit about
how homework stinks.

259
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:48,375
Oh, my vacation was restful,
resplendent, magnificent.

260
00:15:48,539 --> 00:15:50,894
ln fact, next time l'm planning on
going to Corfu.

261
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:53,093
Oh, no.

262
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:54,772
-We gotta talk.
-No way, Kramer.

263
00:15:54,939 --> 00:15:57,897
You brought me only misfortune
and humiliation. Now, get out.

264
00:15:58,059 --> 00:15:59,731
-But, Jackie.
-l said, out.

265
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:02,732
Jackie, l think l got a case
against the tobacco companies.

266
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:06,249
-The who?
-The tobacco companies.

267
00:16:10,299 --> 00:16:12,654
l've been wanting a piece of them
for years.

268
00:16:28,579 --> 00:16:31,855
Did that cigarette label mention
any damage to your appearance?

269
00:16:32,019 --> 00:16:34,817
-No, no, it didn't say anything.
-So you were a victim...

270
00:16:34,979 --> 00:16:38,176
...and now your face is
sallow, unattractive, disgusting.

271
00:16:39,219 --> 00:16:44,691
-So, Jackie, you think we got a case?
-Your face is my case.

272
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:54,130
-Hey.
-Hey, how are you doing?

273
00:16:54,299 --> 00:16:56,767
Not good. l'm a moron.

274
00:16:57,739 --> 00:16:58,728
Don't worry about it.

275
00:16:58,899 --> 00:17:01,732
Once he passes the test,
you'll have sex and you'll be fine.

276
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:05,051
Well, that kind of brings us
to why l'm here.

277
00:17:06,139 --> 00:17:08,209
You got 1 1 minutes?

278
00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:11,257
What for?

279
00:17:15,139 --> 00:17:16,492
Oh, come on.

280
00:17:16,659 --> 00:17:19,696
l just wanna clear my head.
lt has nothing to do with you.

281
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:23,692
l think it has something to do
with me.

282
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:27,647
You could read the paper
through the whole thing, if you want.

283
00:17:29,419 --> 00:17:33,298
No, no, no. l'm sorry.
This is too weird.

284
00:17:34,099 --> 00:17:36,249
All right.

285
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:38,410
ls Kramer home?

286
00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:43,774
You know, Louise,
l think you'll find this amusing.

287
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:48,455
-ln early Euclidean geometry they--
-George, l have to have sex.

288
00:17:48,619 --> 00:17:50,496
l used to share
that very same outlook...

289
00:17:50,659 --> 00:17:52,968
...but now l have so many things
to occupy my mind.

290
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:56,495
-For instance, the atom.
-Goodbye, George.

291
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:58,729
l hate you.

292
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,934
Fascinating turn of events.

293
00:18:08,979 --> 00:18:12,813
Ms. Wilkie, your tobacco company
has turned this beautiful specimen...

294
00:18:12,979 --> 00:18:15,777
...into a horrible, twisted freak.

295
00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:18,693
Who could love me?

296
00:18:20,939 --> 00:18:27,014
l disagree. ln fact, l feel Mr. Kramer
projects a rugged masculinity.

297
00:18:30,499 --> 00:18:33,332
Rugged? The man's a goblin.

298
00:18:33,499 --> 00:18:35,569
He's only been exposed to smoke
for four days.

299
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:39,493
By the time this case gets to trial, he'll
be nothing more than a shrunken head.

300
00:18:41,139 --> 00:18:44,529
All right, Mr. Chiles,
you'll have our offer by tomorrow.

301
00:18:44,699 --> 00:18:47,452
-Good day, gentlemen.
-Yeah, bye-bye.

302
00:18:47,899 --> 00:18:51,130
Jackie. Jackie, you did it.
We're rich.

303
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:55,053
You better believe it. Jackie's cashing
in on your wretched disfigurement.

304
00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:01,291
Congratulations! You passed.

305
00:19:01,459 --> 00:19:04,929
Elaine, Elaine, l don't think
we should see each other anymore.

306
00:19:05,259 --> 00:19:07,250
What?
You're breaking me up with me?

307
00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:11,458
But l sacrificed and supported you
while you struggled.

308
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:14,334
What about my dream
of dating a doctor?

309
00:19:14,499 --> 00:19:17,571
l'm sorry, Elaine. l always knew
that after l became a doctor...

310
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:20,458
...l would dump whoever l was with
and find someone better.

311
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:23,975
That's the dream
of becoming a doctor.

312
00:19:24,859 --> 00:19:27,896
Lookit.
Are we gonna have sex or not?

313
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:33,530
Jerry, when the glee club's finished
singing, George goes on, then you.

314
00:19:33,699 --> 00:19:36,930
-Hey.
-Where have you been? You're on next.

315
00:19:37,099 --> 00:19:38,532
l got lost on the way over.

316
00:19:38,699 --> 00:19:42,738
Got lost? We went to school here
for three years.

317
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:47,457
What are these?
Take me to your leader.

318
00:19:49,899 --> 00:19:52,618
Oh, my God, you had sex.

319
00:19:53,899 --> 00:19:58,893
-You had sex with Louise.
-No, the Portuguese waitress.

320
00:19:59,059 --> 00:20:00,777
The Portuguese waitress?

321
00:20:00,939 --> 00:20:03,612
l calculated my odds
of ever getting together...

322
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:07,658
...with a Portuguese waitress.
Mathematically, l had to do it, Jerry.

323
00:20:07,819 --> 00:20:09,047
George, George, you're on.

324
00:20:09,219 --> 00:20:12,097
-Oh, l'm not going on.
-What did you come down here for?

325
00:20:12,259 --> 00:20:14,773
To tell you
about the Portuguese waitress.

326
00:20:15,579 --> 00:20:17,251
lt's good to have you back.

327
00:20:17,419 --> 00:20:21,492
-One of you has to go on.
-All right. l'll do it.

328
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:27,051
Hey, kids,
what's the deal with homework?

329
00:20:27,219 --> 00:20:29,494
You're not working on your home.

330
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:35,694
That was a great lunch, Jackie.
Thanks.

331
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:38,054
lt's puzzling we haven't
gotten that offer yet.

332
00:20:38,379 --> 00:20:41,098
Well, Mrs. Wilkie
from the tobacco company called me.

333
00:20:41,259 --> 00:20:42,533
And we had a little powwow.

334
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:44,610
A powwow?
Who told you to have a powwow?

335
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:46,929
l didn't tell you to have a powwow.

336
00:20:47,099 --> 00:20:49,374
-She made an offer. l took it.
-How much?

337
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:52,736
-No, no, no. There was no money.
-No money? Then, what did we get?

338
00:20:54,619 --> 00:20:56,337
Check it out.

339
00:21:00,379 --> 00:21:03,655
This is the most public yet
of my many humiliations.

340
00:21:10,899 --> 00:21:14,016
Cancelled? But l was supposed to
be on tomorrow night.

341
00:21:14,179 --> 00:21:16,647
Yeah, but then,
some people were telling me about...

342
00:21:16,819 --> 00:21:20,334
...that little flap out there
at the junior high school assembly.

343
00:21:21,939 --> 00:21:25,215
And before that,
you were bumped by a lizard?

344
00:21:26,259 --> 00:21:28,454
lt was a--
Actually, it was a monitor lizard.

345
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:30,610
Those things, deadly, dangerous.

346
00:21:30,779 --> 00:21:34,408
A long time ago, my uncle and a date
are driving, like, through Mexico.

347
00:21:34,579 --> 00:21:35,898
They see one on the road.

348
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:38,334
Drags him out of the car
and chews his face off.

349
00:21:38,779 --> 00:21:41,498
Listen. We'll call you if anything
opens up. Okay, Jimmy?

350
00:21:41,659 --> 00:21:44,048
-Jerry.
-Right. Jerry.
