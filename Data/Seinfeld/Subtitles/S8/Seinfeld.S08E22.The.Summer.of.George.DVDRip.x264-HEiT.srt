1
00:00:04,569 --> 00:00:06,287
l can't believe the Yankees fired me.

2
00:00:06,449 --> 00:00:09,202
Well, you had a good run.
You took them to the World Series.

3
00:00:09,769 --> 00:00:12,078
l gotta give the players
most of the credit for that.

4
00:00:12,489 --> 00:00:16,084
Don't sell yourself short. You made
flight arrangements, hotels, buses.

5
00:00:16,249 --> 00:00:18,319
No, l don't know who was doing that.

6
00:00:18,649 --> 00:00:21,447
So when you actually did work,
what is it that you did?

7
00:00:23,009 --> 00:00:25,523
l'll tell you, they had a pastry cart
you wouldn't believe.

8
00:00:25,849 --> 00:00:27,601
Here we go.

9
00:00:27,769 --> 00:00:29,521
Your latte.

10
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:31,361
Your cappuccino.

11
00:00:34,609 --> 00:00:35,883
Maybe l should ask her out.

12
00:00:36,409 --> 00:00:38,798
-She is a good waitress.
-lt's true.

13
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:41,927
-Maybe l'll take her to the Tonys.
-You're going to the Tonys?

14
00:00:42,089 --> 00:00:45,047
Yeah, l wrote some jokes for the show
and they gave me two tickets.

15
00:00:45,209 --> 00:00:48,246
Why didn't you ask me?
l know a million theatre jokes.

16
00:00:48,409 --> 00:00:52,846
What's the deal with those guys
down in the pit?

17
00:00:53,249 --> 00:00:56,047
They're musicians. That's not a joke.

18
00:00:56,209 --> 00:00:58,803
lt's a funny observation.

19
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:02,202
Severance package?

20
00:01:02,369 --> 00:01:05,202
The Yankees are giving me three
months' full pay for doing nothing.

21
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:07,758
They did it for three years.
What's another few months?

22
00:01:07,929 --> 00:01:10,079
l'm gonna do something
with these three months.

23
00:01:10,249 --> 00:01:12,365
-Like what?
-l'm gonna read a book...

24
00:01:12,529 --> 00:01:14,599
...from beginning to end,
in that order.

25
00:01:14,769 --> 00:01:16,361
l've always wanted to do that.

26
00:01:16,529 --> 00:01:18,804
-l'm going to play Frolf.
-You mean golf?

27
00:01:18,969 --> 00:01:23,247
Frolf. Frisbee golf, Jerry.
Golf with a Frisbee.

28
00:01:24,169 --> 00:01:25,443
This is gonna be my time.

29
00:01:25,609 --> 00:01:29,238
Time to taste the fruits
and let the juices drip down my chin.

30
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:33,721
l proclaim this
''The Summer of George.''

31
00:01:45,529 --> 00:01:47,599
And then Peterman ate it.

32
00:01:47,769 --> 00:01:49,521
l never told him.

33
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,002
-Who is that?
-That's Sam...

34
00:01:56,169 --> 00:01:57,443
...the new girl in Accounting.

35
00:01:57,609 --> 00:02:00,885
What's with her arms?
They just hang like salamis.

36
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:02,402
She walks like an orangutan.

37
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:04,400
Better call the zoo.

38
00:02:06,809 --> 00:02:08,481
What?

39
00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:10,844
Catty.

40
00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:17,329
lt's like she's carrying
invisible suitcases.

41
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:19,286
-Like this?
-Yes, exactly.

42
00:02:19,449 --> 00:02:21,201
-That is so strange.
-Right.

43
00:02:21,369 --> 00:02:24,122
So why am l the one who gets:

44
00:02:24,289 --> 00:02:26,439
l mean, they were being
just as catty as l was.

45
00:02:26,609 --> 00:02:28,361
lt's a double standard.

46
00:02:28,529 --> 00:02:32,317
Oh, and what about ladies' night?
Women admitted free before 1 0?

47
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:35,599
That is so stupid.

48
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:39,600
Hey, The White Shadow is on.

49
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:42,165
Boy, you're really packing it all in.

50
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:46,563
Jerry, my vacation has just started.
l need a day or two to decompress.

51
00:02:46,729 --> 00:02:48,720
-Besides, l did plenty today.
-Like what?

52
00:02:48,889 --> 00:02:51,449
l bought a new recliner
with a fridge built right into it.

53
00:02:52,729 --> 00:02:55,118
Hey, Jerry, you got any TUMS?

54
00:02:55,289 --> 00:02:57,519
-Stomach ache?
-l drank too much water in the shower.

55
00:02:57,849 --> 00:02:59,760
Top of the fridge.

56
00:03:00,289 --> 00:03:02,723
Hey, George, l'm taking
that waitress to the Tonys.

57
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:05,562
-Shadow.
-Oh, the Tonys?

58
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:07,287
l'll see you there, buddy.

59
00:03:07,449 --> 00:03:09,485
-You're going to the Tonys too?
-Roger that.

60
00:03:09,649 --> 00:03:11,879
-Where are you sitting?
-Well, all over the place.

61
00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:14,688
l'm a seat-filler. They don't like
to see empty seats on TV.

62
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:17,841
Somebody gets up, l park my caboose
in their spot until they get back.

63
00:03:18,009 --> 00:03:20,284
-How did you get that job?
-Mickey, he hooked me up.

64
00:03:20,449 --> 00:03:22,644
-Yeah, he's a member of the academy.
-What academy?

65
00:03:22,809 --> 00:03:24,765
Well, he didn't say.

66
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:30,918
-Hi.
-Hi.

67
00:03:31,089 --> 00:03:33,922
-Nice tuxedo.
-Thanks. lt's a breakaway.

68
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:35,886
-Should we go?
-Absolutely.

69
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,121
-Lyle, we're going.
-All right.

70
00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:40,563
Jerry, this is Lyle.

71
00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:44,166
-Hey, how you doing?
-Okay.

72
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:45,648
Bye.

73
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:50,643
-Have a good time.
-Thanks...

74
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:53,002
...Lyle.

75
00:03:59,369 --> 00:04:01,837
Are you leaving?
Because l got you covered.

76
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:04,722
l'll just go ahead and get in there.

77
00:04:04,969 --> 00:04:08,803
Just a minute. What are you doing?

78
00:04:08,969 --> 00:04:11,278
My job. What are you doing?

79
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:19,044
They catch the two of us on TV,
you might have a little explaining to do.

80
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:26,326
-So you and Lyle are roommates?
-No.

81
00:04:28,089 --> 00:04:29,807
-Gay?
-What?

82
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:33,120
-ls he gay?
-No.

83
00:04:34,329 --> 00:04:35,842
Are you sure?

84
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:38,400
l think l would know.

85
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:43,239
This is a new one.

86
00:04:43,809 --> 00:04:46,528
Turkey jerky? Go ahead, take a pull.

87
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:49,127
More for me.

88
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:58,242
And the Tony for best musical
is awarded to Scarsdale Surprise.

89
00:04:58,929 --> 00:05:01,204
Lewis Maxtone-Graham,
Douglas Ewing...

90
00:05:01,369 --> 00:05:03,929
...Benjamin London,
Polly Kennedy, producers.

91
00:05:20,289 --> 00:05:22,325
-Kramer?
-Thank you and bless you all.

92
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:26,323
This truly has been
a Scarsdale Surprise.

93
00:05:33,609 --> 00:05:34,962
Elaine, am l crazy?

94
00:05:35,129 --> 00:05:37,040
l just get the feeling that...

95
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:40,804
...Dugan and the others are
making fun of me all the time.

96
00:05:41,529 --> 00:05:46,000
Well, you might wanna think
about maybe...

97
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:49,525
...moving your arms a little
when you walk.

98
00:05:49,689 --> 00:05:50,963
My arms?

99
00:05:51,129 --> 00:05:53,324
You know, sort of swing them...

100
00:05:53,489 --> 00:05:59,121
...so you're not lurching around,
you know, like a caveman.

101
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:02,158
l'm a caveman?

102
00:06:02,649 --> 00:06:04,719
No, no, no, it's just that--

103
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:08,325
Everyone told me
what a catty shrew you were.

104
00:06:08,489 --> 00:06:09,808
You're horrible.

105
00:06:14,649 --> 00:06:15,843
She had a dude?

106
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:18,159
When l went to pick her up,
there was this dude.

107
00:06:18,329 --> 00:06:21,207
-How do you know it was her dude?
-lt could've been just some dude?

108
00:06:21,369 --> 00:06:23,087
Dudes in this town
are a dime a dozen.

109
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:25,080
-l reckon.
-Or maybe...

110
00:06:25,249 --> 00:06:27,126
...she just wanted to go to the Tonys.

111
00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:29,757
l tell you what. Ask her out again.
No Tony, just Jerry.

112
00:06:29,929 --> 00:06:32,318
That way you know if the dude
is her dude or some dude.

113
00:06:32,489 --> 00:06:34,798
-Dude.
-Yeah.

114
00:06:34,969 --> 00:06:37,802
All right, that's enough.
l gotta go home and take a nap.

115
00:06:37,969 --> 00:06:39,197
lt's 1 0:30 in the morning.

116
00:06:39,369 --> 00:06:41,360
What can l tell you, l'm wiped.

117
00:06:41,529 --> 00:06:44,839
So has the Summer of George begun,
or are you still decomposing?

118
00:06:45,329 --> 00:06:47,126
Decompressing.

119
00:06:49,049 --> 00:06:53,679
Well, good morning, gentlemen,
and Tony says hello to you.

120
00:06:53,849 --> 00:06:56,443
-You didn't give that thing back?
-Jerry, it was a whirlwind.

121
00:06:56,609 --> 00:06:59,999
They whisk us backstage.
The media is swarming.

122
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:02,478
Champagne is flowing.

123
00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:04,958
l can't describe
how great it is to win.

124
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:06,767
That's because you didn't win.

125
00:07:06,929 --> 00:07:08,328
Scarsdale Surprise.

126
00:07:08,489 --> 00:07:11,526
That's the musical about
the Scarsdale diet doctor murder.

127
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:16,479
Featuring the mind-blowing
performance of Miss Raquel Welch.

128
00:07:16,649 --> 00:07:18,002
You haven't even seen it.

129
00:07:18,169 --> 00:07:21,559
Oh, Jerry, l'm not gonna let you
bring me down off this high.

130
00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:23,162
l've been partying all night.

131
00:07:23,329 --> 00:07:25,320
l saw the sun rise at Liza's.

132
00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:27,799
-Minnelli's?
-No.

133
00:07:30,729 --> 00:07:34,563
Sam, listen. l am so sorry
about the other day.

134
00:07:34,729 --> 00:07:36,959
No, don't apologize, Elaine.

135
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:40,838
l was thinking that maybe l should
swing my arms a little bit more.

136
00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:44,168
See, yeah, l mean,
that's all l was saying.

137
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:46,047
How's this?

138
00:07:47,369 --> 00:07:50,645
Or this? Or this?

139
00:07:50,809 --> 00:07:54,484
-Or this? Or this?
-Well...

140
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:56,719
...you seem to be
getting the hang of it.

141
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,202
-Hi.
-Sorry, l'm running late.

142
00:08:02,369 --> 00:08:05,088
-l just lost track of time.
-No rush.

143
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:08,247
Hey, Jerr, what's up?

144
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:12,043
l have absolutely no idea.

145
00:08:16,609 --> 00:08:19,487
Can you believe she expected me
to squire her around town...

146
00:08:19,649 --> 00:08:22,163
...while the dude sits at home
in swaddling clothes?

147
00:08:22,409 --> 00:08:24,877
Do they make swaddling clothes
for adults?

148
00:08:25,049 --> 00:08:27,438
lt's like she's put the role
of boyfriend into two jobs.

149
00:08:27,609 --> 00:08:29,327
Except the dude's playing
the showroom...

150
00:08:29,489 --> 00:08:31,559
...and l'm stuck doing
food and beverage.

151
00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:33,526
-Hey.
-Who's that?

152
00:08:33,689 --> 00:08:35,998
-lt's Kramer.
-Hey, Kramer.

153
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:38,922
-George says hi.
-Hi, George.

154
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:40,568
How's that Tony?

155
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,447
Why don't you just come over here?

156
00:08:42,609 --> 00:08:44,247
Why can't l do this on the phone?

157
00:08:44,409 --> 00:08:46,969
-What's Kramer doing now?
-He's looking in the refrigerator.

158
00:08:47,129 --> 00:08:50,565
Kramer. Anything good in there?
Any Popsicles?

159
00:08:50,729 --> 00:08:52,003
l cannot do this.

160
00:08:52,169 --> 00:08:54,444
-So, what's George doing?
-He's not doing anything.

161
00:08:54,969 --> 00:08:56,402
Goodbye.

162
00:08:57,369 --> 00:09:00,042
l'm gonna grab a bite to eat at Sardi's.
You wanna go?

163
00:09:00,209 --> 00:09:01,927
Are you taking the Tony to Sardi's?

164
00:09:02,089 --> 00:09:04,922
The Tony is taking me to Sardi's.

165
00:09:07,569 --> 00:09:09,844
Oh, hello.

166
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:12,569
-Well, l'm going.
-Congratulations.

167
00:09:12,729 --> 00:09:16,404
Well, thank you.
Thank you so much.

168
00:09:16,569 --> 00:09:19,527
l have so many people l want to thank.
l don't want to forget anyone.

169
00:09:19,689 --> 00:09:21,998
All right. All right.

170
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:25,203
l said no.

171
00:09:26,569 --> 00:09:30,960
Jerry, l just want to let you know
Lyle and l are completely over.

172
00:09:31,129 --> 00:09:32,528
l'd rather be with you.

173
00:09:32,689 --> 00:09:37,285
Just me? No dudes or fellers?

174
00:09:37,449 --> 00:09:40,043
-What do you think?
-l can start right away.

175
00:09:40,969 --> 00:09:42,880
-But not here.
-I'm not here. Leave a message.

176
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,482
Jerry, what's happening?

177
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:47,527
Jerry, come on, pick up the phone.

178
00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:53,038
So l said to him,
''Arthur, Artie, bubele...

179
00:09:53,609 --> 00:09:56,521
...why does the salesman have to die?
Change the title.

180
00:09:56,689 --> 00:10:00,967
The Life of a Salesman.
That's what people want to see.''

181
00:10:01,129 --> 00:10:02,642
Excuse me, Mr. Kramer.

182
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:05,687
My name is Lewis Maxtone-Graham.

183
00:10:05,849 --> 00:10:08,921
l'm one of the producers
of Scarsdale Surprise.

184
00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:12,081
Oh, hey. Yeah. Lew!

185
00:10:12,249 --> 00:10:13,921
We need to talk.

186
00:10:17,609 --> 00:10:19,725
Elaine, what did you want
to talk to me about?

187
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:22,323
This. My office.

188
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:24,844
Sam trashed my office.

189
00:10:25,009 --> 00:10:27,807
Well, l see what's going on here.

190
00:10:27,969 --> 00:10:31,757
l am smack-dab in the middle
of a good old-fashioned catfight.

191
00:10:31,929 --> 00:10:34,966
Mr. Peterman, this is not a catfight.

192
00:10:35,129 --> 00:10:39,520
This is violent, psychotic behaviour,
directed at me...

193
00:10:39,689 --> 00:10:42,328
...all because l told her
to swing her arms.

194
00:10:44,729 --> 00:10:46,162
Do you mean:

195
00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:49,480
Yes, that's the one.
Good day, Elaine.

196
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:53,324
Oh, no, please, Mr. Peterman.
She's crazy.

197
00:10:54,249 --> 00:10:57,207
Crazy for feeling

198
00:10:57,369 --> 00:11:02,602
So lonely

199
00:11:04,929 --> 00:11:07,363
l can't believe how much
we did this afternoon.

200
00:11:07,529 --> 00:11:09,645
l have a friend,
today would be his whole life.

201
00:11:09,809 --> 00:11:12,482
Now, what time are you
picking me up tonight?

202
00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:14,640
You got reservations at Sfuzzi,
didn't you?

203
00:11:14,809 --> 00:11:16,720
Oh, yeah, Sfuzzi. l gotta do that.

204
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:19,119
-Should l wear the outfit l bought?
-Sure.

205
00:11:19,289 --> 00:11:22,964
-Which one?
-The one with the:

206
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:24,881
lf l'm gonna get my hair cut,
l better go.

207
00:11:25,049 --> 00:11:26,960
Call me when you get home.
l won't be there...

208
00:11:27,129 --> 00:11:28,562
...but leave a message
so l know.

209
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:29,923
Okay. Okay.

210
00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:33,562
-Do you mind?
-No, l'll grab them, yeah.

211
00:11:36,249 --> 00:11:38,319
Hey. l've done that today.

212
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:42,521
-What? Did you lose your remote?
-No, cable's out.

213
00:11:42,689 --> 00:11:45,078
-What's with you? You look dead.
-lt's Lanette.

214
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:47,928
l need, like, an assistant
or an intern or something.

215
00:11:48,489 --> 00:11:51,083
Relationship intern, huh?

216
00:11:53,169 --> 00:11:57,367
Hey, what if the two of us
teamed up?

217
00:11:57,529 --> 00:12:00,089
-Not...?
-No, no.

218
00:12:00,249 --> 00:12:01,762
-No, because that's--
-No.

219
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,999
Listen, we're always sitting here.

220
00:12:04,169 --> 00:12:05,682
l help you with your girl problems.

221
00:12:05,849 --> 00:12:07,999
You help with my girl problems.
Where do we end up?

222
00:12:08,169 --> 00:12:10,160
-Here.
-Exactly, because neither one of us...

223
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:11,887
...can handle a woman
by ourselves.

224
00:12:12,049 --> 00:12:14,040
-l'm trying.
-l've tried.

225
00:12:14,209 --> 00:12:15,437
We don't have it.

226
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:19,727
But maybe the two of us,
working together at full capacity...

227
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:22,722
...could do the job
of one normal man.

228
00:12:22,889 --> 00:12:25,528
And each of us would only
have to be, like, a half-man.

229
00:12:27,209 --> 00:12:30,007
That sounds about right.

230
00:12:30,169 --> 00:12:31,921
We understand
how excited you are....

231
00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:34,125
..to have this very,
very prestigious award.

232
00:12:34,289 --> 00:12:37,201
But you didn't have anything to do
with the actual production.

233
00:12:37,369 --> 00:12:38,722
No.

234
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:42,484
l'm afraid there is no way
we can allow you to keep this Tony.

235
00:12:43,169 --> 00:12:44,887
-What?
-Unless--

236
00:12:45,049 --> 00:12:47,199
-Anything.
-Are you familiar with our star...

237
00:12:47,369 --> 00:12:50,327
-...Raquel Welch?
-She's fantastic.

238
00:12:50,489 --> 00:12:51,888
She's a train wreck.

239
00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:54,767
There's a big tap-dance number...

240
00:12:54,929 --> 00:12:57,045
...before Jean Harris leaves
The Madeira School...

241
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:58,562
...to confront Dr. Tarnower.

242
00:12:58,729 --> 00:13:00,879
-lt is a gut-wrenching scene.
-Yes.

243
00:13:01,689 --> 00:13:04,681
But Raquel Welch doesn't move
her arms when she tap dances.

244
00:13:04,849 --> 00:13:06,328
lt's very distracting.

245
00:13:06,489 --> 00:13:10,004
There is a lot of this...in tap dancing.

246
00:13:10,169 --> 00:13:13,047
So you'd like me to teach her
how to dance?

247
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,769
No, we want you to fire her.

248
00:13:23,249 --> 00:13:25,205
Why do they want you
to fire Raquel Welch?

249
00:13:25,369 --> 00:13:27,007
Because they're terrified of her.

250
00:13:27,169 --> 00:13:28,887
l heard they cut one of her lines.

251
00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:31,119
She climbed up a rope
on the side of the stage...

252
00:13:31,289 --> 00:13:33,928
...and started dropping lights
on people's heads.

253
00:13:34,089 --> 00:13:36,080
A story like that's gotta be true.

254
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:39,042
She seems very nice.

255
00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:40,722
Jerry, you're not in show business.

256
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:42,561
You don't know
what these people are like.

257
00:13:42,729 --> 00:13:45,687
-l'm in show business.
-Oh, come on.

258
00:13:47,249 --> 00:13:49,285
What am l gonna do?
She's gonna eat me alive.

259
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:52,168
l got a tape of Fantastic Voyage,
if you think that'll help.

260
00:13:52,329 --> 00:13:53,318
l'll take it.

261
00:13:53,849 --> 00:13:58,923
Jerry, that crazy straight-arm woman
down at Peterman's trashed my office.

262
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:02,718
And then listen to this.
This is the message she left me.

263
00:14:02,889 --> 00:14:06,484
Elaine, I am going to find you.

264
00:14:06,649 --> 00:14:09,880
If not in your office,
then in the X erox room...

265
00:14:10,089 --> 00:14:13,445
... or the small conference room
next to the kitchen, or the kitchen.

266
00:14:13,609 --> 00:14:16,407
l mean, she must have a blueprint
of the building or something.

267
00:14:16,569 --> 00:14:18,878
-Did you tell Peterman about this?
-Well, l tried.

268
00:14:19,049 --> 00:14:21,119
But he thought it was
some sort of a catfight.

269
00:14:21,289 --> 00:14:22,722
Catfight?

270
00:14:23,569 --> 00:14:25,719
Okay. Why? Why do guys do this?

271
00:14:25,929 --> 00:14:28,727
What is so appealing to men
about a catfight?

272
00:14:28,889 --> 00:14:30,402
Catfight.

273
00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:37,684
Because men think if women are
grabbing and clawing at each other...

274
00:14:37,849 --> 00:14:40,409
...there's a chance
they might somehow kiss.

275
00:14:44,729 --> 00:14:46,048
-You got the tickets?
-Yeah.

276
00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:48,325
Two for the 7: 1 5
of Lenore's Promise.

277
00:14:48,489 --> 00:14:50,081
What, are you wearing
a green sweater?

278
00:14:50,249 --> 00:14:51,443
-l like it.
-Lanette doesn't.

279
00:14:51,609 --> 00:14:53,247
Here's your blue one.
lt's her favourite.

280
00:14:53,409 --> 00:14:55,127
-What?
-Just put it on.

281
00:14:55,289 --> 00:14:58,520
All right. Now, remember
she got her nails done today...

282
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,759
...so remark on
how you like the colour.

283
00:15:00,929 --> 00:15:02,885
And if you need me, you beep me.
All right?

284
00:15:03,049 --> 00:15:04,687
Here, here. There you go.
There you go.

285
00:15:04,849 --> 00:15:06,441
All right.

286
00:15:06,609 --> 00:15:08,918
-Go get them. You're a tiger!
-Hey, George, one second.

287
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:11,842
She's having a party Friday.
She wants me to do the invitations.

288
00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:14,318
A little notice would have helped.
How many people?

289
00:15:14,489 --> 00:15:17,526
Thirty-five.
And, George, on the invitations--

290
00:15:17,689 --> 00:15:19,247
Yeah, l know. Don't skimp. Go, go.

291
00:15:20,729 --> 00:15:22,401
Right on time. l like that.

292
00:15:22,569 --> 00:15:25,037
l like your nails.
That is a great colour.

293
00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:28,246
-Love the sweater.
-This old thing?

294
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:31,600
Hi, l need some party invitations.

295
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:34,078
Okay. Have you been in here before?

296
00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:37,880
About a year ago.
Wedding invitations.

297
00:15:38,089 --> 00:15:40,649
Right. How did that all work out?

298
00:15:41,489 --> 00:15:43,241
No complaints.

299
00:15:44,449 --> 00:15:49,603
Well, they're arranged according
to price, and as l recall....

300
00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:54,638
Actually, l'll take these nice,
glossy ones.

301
00:15:56,129 --> 00:15:57,847
You are a fraud, Dr. Tarnower.

302
00:15:58,209 --> 00:16:00,165
You haven't even been
to Scarsdale.

303
00:16:02,249 --> 00:16:04,399
-Miss Welch. Hi.
-Who are you?

304
00:16:05,169 --> 00:16:06,966
Well, l'm Cosmo Kramer.

305
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:09,120
l'm one of the producers.

306
00:16:10,609 --> 00:16:12,839
Hello. Sidney.

307
00:16:14,369 --> 00:16:18,044
No. No, l told you
l don't want to do that.

308
00:16:18,209 --> 00:16:22,168
lf you bring it up again,
l'll feed your genitals to a wolf.

309
00:16:22,609 --> 00:16:24,122
Kids.

310
00:16:24,969 --> 00:16:27,039
-You're still here?
-Well, Miss Welch...

311
00:16:27,209 --> 00:16:32,078
...l do need to talk to you about a little
problem regarding your performance.

312
00:16:33,129 --> 00:16:35,120
-What kind of problem?
-Well, it seems that...

313
00:16:35,289 --> 00:16:38,804
...due to the vagaries
of the production parameters...

314
00:16:38,969 --> 00:16:43,121
...vis-à-vis the fragmenting of
the audience, due to cable television...

315
00:16:43,289 --> 00:16:45,757
-...carnivals, water parks--
-Out with it.

316
00:16:45,929 --> 00:16:48,363
You're fired. You don't use your arms
when you tap dance.

317
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:50,167
You're like a gorilla. l gotta go.

318
00:16:57,009 --> 00:16:58,681
A little help?

319
00:16:58,849 --> 00:17:00,168
-Hey, Frolf?
-Yeah.

320
00:17:00,329 --> 00:17:03,287
You know, we need a fourth
for the back nine. You want in?

321
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:08,968
What's the deal
with airplane peanuts?

322
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:12,238
-Yeah, sure.
-Come on.

323
00:17:13,889 --> 00:17:15,368
Well, l'm ready.

324
00:17:15,529 --> 00:17:17,485
Let's towel it up.

325
00:17:17,929 --> 00:17:20,489
Jerry, where are those invitations
you were supposed to get?

326
00:17:20,649 --> 00:17:22,958
lf they don't go out today,
they're useless.

327
00:17:23,129 --> 00:17:24,642
But we're in towels.

328
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:27,448
-Jerry.
-All right, one second.

329
00:17:29,689 --> 00:17:33,125
He Frolfs...he scores!

330
00:17:37,889 --> 00:17:40,244
-Hello.
-George, where are those invitations?

331
00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:42,639
You were supposed to leave them
with her doorman.

332
00:17:42,809 --> 00:17:45,528
-Did you shave your chest hair?
-No.

333
00:17:48,769 --> 00:17:50,122
Did you at least pick them up?

334
00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:52,644
Yeah, yeah, super glossy,
the best they had.

335
00:17:52,809 --> 00:17:54,242
Well, get them over here pronto.

336
00:17:54,409 --> 00:17:55,683
We're at towels here, George.

337
00:17:55,849 --> 00:17:58,124
All right. All right.
Keep your towel on.

338
00:17:59,009 --> 00:18:01,159
-What?
-lt's a joke.

339
00:18:01,329 --> 00:18:04,048
All right. That's not bad.
Now get over here.

340
00:18:12,089 --> 00:18:15,445
--if not in your apartment,
then in the laundry room...

341
00:18:15,609 --> 00:18:18,806
... or the ATM in the building
across the street...

342
00:18:18,969 --> 00:18:21,039
... or the watch shop!

343
00:18:21,209 --> 00:18:24,406
Can't you do anything about this?
l mean, this woman is a psycho.

344
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:30,597
Look, just because l'm a woman
doesn't mean--

345
00:18:32,249 --> 00:18:34,604
l don't move my arms when l dance?

346
00:18:34,769 --> 00:18:36,327
That's my signature.

347
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:39,040
Would you just keep an eye out
for this woman?

348
00:18:39,209 --> 00:18:41,086
She's about, l don't know,
yay high...

349
00:18:41,249 --> 00:18:45,288
...and she doesn't swing her arms
when she walks.

350
00:18:45,449 --> 00:18:48,247
-What do you mean?
-Like this:

351
00:18:50,969 --> 00:18:54,405
What the hell is that?
Are you making fun of my dancing?

352
00:18:55,289 --> 00:18:56,847
Aren't you Raquel Welch?

353
00:18:57,009 --> 00:19:00,046
You know who l am.
Now, what are you doing?

354
00:19:00,209 --> 00:19:03,599
Nothing. l just wasn't
moving my arms.

355
00:19:04,249 --> 00:19:06,763
That's it. You're going down.

356
00:19:07,569 --> 00:19:09,525
Catfight.

357
00:19:13,289 --> 00:19:14,404
So how's George?

358
00:19:14,569 --> 00:19:16,639
l don't know.
They won't tell me anything.

359
00:19:16,809 --> 00:19:18,083
What's that?

360
00:19:19,929 --> 00:19:21,760
Tony.

361
00:19:22,889 --> 00:19:25,278
-What happened to you?
-Raquel Welch.

362
00:19:29,449 --> 00:19:32,247
-What happened to you?
-Raquel Welch.

363
00:19:32,569 --> 00:19:34,560
-The woman is a menace.
-Yeah.

364
00:19:34,729 --> 00:19:38,165
l bumped into her on the street.
lt got pretty ugly.

365
00:19:39,289 --> 00:19:42,361
A catfight with Raquel Welch.

366
00:19:45,969 --> 00:19:48,244
My God, George.

367
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,924
l slipped on the invitations.

368
00:19:52,289 --> 00:19:54,598
-How's the towels?
-They're back on the rack.

369
00:19:54,769 --> 00:19:57,841
-Even with the two of us?
-l think we're still a man short.

370
00:19:59,289 --> 00:20:01,439
Mr. Costanza...

371
00:20:05,169 --> 00:20:08,081
...your legs have sustained
extensive trauma.

372
00:20:08,689 --> 00:20:12,887
Apparently, your body was in
a state of advanced atrophy...

373
00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:16,007
...due to a period
of extreme inactivity.

374
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:20,080
But with a lot of hard work
and a little bit of luck...

375
00:20:20,249 --> 00:20:25,369
...l think there's a good chance
you may, one day, walk again.

376
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:31,601
Well, that's good news.

377
00:20:32,849 --> 00:20:36,046
Wow, invitations again.

378
00:20:37,209 --> 00:20:39,769
Yeah, that's weird.

379
00:20:41,769 --> 00:20:44,158
All right. Well....

380
00:20:44,969 --> 00:20:47,278
-You want to grab some coffee?
-Yeah, coffee.

381
00:20:47,449 --> 00:20:49,440
-l'd like to get some coffee.
-Okay.

382
00:20:55,729 --> 00:20:58,880
This was supposed to be
the Summer of George.

383
00:21:00,369 --> 00:21:02,644
The Summer of George.

384
00:21:16,089 --> 00:21:17,807
Summer of George.

385
00:21:17,969 --> 00:21:19,322
-Swing them.
-Swing them.

386
00:21:19,489 --> 00:21:22,003
-Right? Okay?
-Sort of swing.

387
00:21:26,729 --> 00:21:29,004
Swing them.

388
00:21:30,529 --> 00:21:31,723
Just swing them.

389
00:21:31,889 --> 00:21:35,723
l can't do it. Okay? lt's hard.

390
00:21:36,369 --> 00:21:38,405
-Come on. Okay?
-Here we go.

391
00:21:38,569 --> 00:21:42,164
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah--

392
00:21:44,329 --> 00:21:46,638
There's still a little summer left.
