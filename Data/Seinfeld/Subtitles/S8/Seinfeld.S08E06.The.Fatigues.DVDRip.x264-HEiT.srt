1
00:00:04,276 --> 00:00:07,586
l started out working in mortgage
bonds, but l found that so limiting.

2
00:00:07,756 --> 00:00:10,509
My friend Kramer and l were
discussing that the other day.

3
00:00:10,676 --> 00:00:12,428
He was with Brandt-Leland
for a while.

4
00:00:14,516 --> 00:00:17,588
Well, then my mentor suggested
that l move into equities.

5
00:00:17,756 --> 00:00:19,314
Best move l ever made.

6
00:00:19,476 --> 00:00:21,307
-Mentor? You mean your boss?
-No, no, no.

7
00:00:21,476 --> 00:00:23,228
Cynthia's a successful
businesswoman...

8
00:00:23,396 --> 00:00:25,432
...who's taken me under her wing.

9
00:00:25,596 --> 00:00:28,554
-So Cynthia's your mentor?
-And l'm her protégé.

10
00:00:29,036 --> 00:00:30,515
You must have someone like that.

11
00:00:30,676 --> 00:00:32,746
You know, who guides you
in your career path.

12
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:35,510
Well, l like Gabe Kaplan.

13
00:00:40,636 --> 00:00:43,309
l still don't understand this.
Abby has a mentor?

14
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:46,309
Yes. And the mentor
advises the protégé.

15
00:00:46,476 --> 00:00:48,387
ls there any money involved?

16
00:00:48,556 --> 00:00:50,945
-No.
-So, what's in it for the mentor?

17
00:00:51,116 --> 00:00:53,346
Respect, admiration, prestige.

18
00:00:56,796 --> 00:00:59,390
Would the protégé
pick up stuff for the mentor?

19
00:00:59,556 --> 00:01:03,629
l suppose if it was on the protégé's
way to the mentor, they might.

20
00:01:04,036 --> 00:01:05,469
Laundry? Dry cleaning?

21
00:01:06,116 --> 00:01:08,152
lt's not a valet, it's a protégé.

22
00:01:08,796 --> 00:01:09,945
All right.

23
00:01:10,396 --> 00:01:14,628
Listen, l gotta get some reading done.
You mind if l do this here?

24
00:01:14,796 --> 00:01:17,435
l can't concentrate in my apartment.

25
00:01:17,996 --> 00:01:19,668
-'' Risk management''?
-Yeah.

26
00:01:19,876 --> 00:01:21,992
Steinbrenner wants everyone
in the front office...

27
00:01:22,156 --> 00:01:24,670
...to give a lecture
in their area of business expertise.

28
00:01:24,836 --> 00:01:26,906
What makes them think
you're a risk-management expert?

29
00:01:27,316 --> 00:01:29,625
l guess it's on my résumé.

30
00:01:33,316 --> 00:01:36,513
-Hello?
-Please hold for Elaine Benes.

31
00:01:37,516 --> 00:01:42,226
You know what? l can't do this.
l can't read books anymore.

32
00:01:42,396 --> 00:01:44,148
Books on tape
have ruined me, Jerry.

33
00:01:44,316 --> 00:01:48,229
l need that nice voice. This book
has my voice. l hate my voice.

34
00:01:48,396 --> 00:01:51,911
-So get this book on tape.
-You can't. lt's a textbook.

35
00:01:52,076 --> 00:01:54,795
Hey, Jer, are you going
to this Bob Sacamano party?

36
00:01:54,956 --> 00:01:56,753
Am l going? lt was three nights ago.

37
00:01:56,916 --> 00:02:00,147
What? You're kidding.
l just got this invitation today.

38
00:02:00,316 --> 00:02:04,229
Oh, l was so excited.
lt's really a beautiful invitation.

39
00:02:04,396 --> 00:02:06,546
Oh, it was a lovely affair.

40
00:02:07,236 --> 00:02:08,635
Oh, wait a minute.

41
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:14,348
This postmark is three weeks old.
Man, this happens all the time.

42
00:02:14,516 --> 00:02:16,905
Janine, who the hell
runs the mailroom?

43
00:02:17,076 --> 00:02:19,271
-Eddie Sherman.
-All right. Send him up here.

44
00:02:19,436 --> 00:02:22,348
-You gonna do a little yelling?
-l'm gonna do a little firing.

45
00:02:22,516 --> 00:02:25,826
That is so cool.
Can you put me on the speaker?

46
00:02:25,996 --> 00:02:28,510
Oh, yeah. Sure.

47
00:02:28,956 --> 00:02:30,230
Give me a break.

48
00:02:38,516 --> 00:02:40,074
Hey, Copernicus.

49
00:02:43,156 --> 00:02:46,626
-Eddie Sherman is here.
-Oh, great. Send him in.

50
00:02:52,636 --> 00:02:56,549
-You wanted to see me?
-Eddie, yes.

51
00:02:56,716 --> 00:03:00,311
l am so sorry, but l'm afraid
we're gonna have to...

52
00:03:02,236 --> 00:03:04,192
...promote you.

53
00:03:06,116 --> 00:03:07,390
So, what did you say?

54
00:03:07,556 --> 00:03:09,911
Well, l called him
all the way up to my office...

55
00:03:10,076 --> 00:03:12,067
...so l had to tell him
something important.

56
00:03:12,996 --> 00:03:15,749
So l promoted him.

57
00:03:17,116 --> 00:03:19,630
-What? What did you--?
-Copywriter.

58
00:03:20,556 --> 00:03:22,228
He's writing copy?

59
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:27,266
Well, it can't be any worse than the
pointless drivel we normally churn out.

60
00:03:30,156 --> 00:03:31,828
Check it out.

61
00:03:31,996 --> 00:03:35,671
-''Jewish singles night''?
-l expect you both to be there.

62
00:03:35,876 --> 00:03:38,231
-l'm not Jewish.
-Well, neither am l.

63
00:03:38,396 --> 00:03:42,275
-Well, why are you going?
-l'm not. l'm running it.

64
00:03:42,876 --> 00:03:45,310
-What are you talking about?
-Lomez usually runs it...

65
00:03:45,476 --> 00:03:46,875
...but he's in the Everglades.

66
00:03:48,116 --> 00:03:50,391
-Lomez is Jewish?
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

67
00:03:50,556 --> 00:03:53,628
Orthodox, Jerry. Old school.

68
00:03:55,196 --> 00:03:58,154
At the Knights of Columbus?

69
00:03:58,636 --> 00:04:01,150
Yeah. Frank Costanza's
getting me a room in his lodge.

70
00:04:01,316 --> 00:04:03,955
Jerry, l'm really counting on you
to come to this.

71
00:04:04,116 --> 00:04:05,390
-Kramer--
-Jerry, look.

72
00:04:05,556 --> 00:04:07,387
l'm cooking all the food myself.

73
00:04:07,556 --> 00:04:12,107
''A tempting schmeer
of authentic Jewish delicacies.''

74
00:04:13,596 --> 00:04:15,473
Do you like tsimmes?

75
00:04:17,756 --> 00:04:20,224
My mentor says
the duck is outstanding here.

76
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:23,469
l'm not really a duck fan.
The skin seems sort of human.

77
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:27,305
Oh, look who's here. Cynthia.

78
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:29,068
-Hello, Abby.
-Hello.

79
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:31,147
Jerry, this is Cynthia Pearlman,
my mentor.

80
00:04:31,316 --> 00:04:34,035
-Hello.
-Hi, Jerry. Nice to finally meet you.

81
00:04:34,196 --> 00:04:35,788
Join us. We can pull up a chair.

82
00:04:35,956 --> 00:04:38,390
Well, great.
My boyfriend's just parking the car.

83
00:04:38,756 --> 00:04:42,146
Actually, Jerry, you might know him.
He's a comic too.

84
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:44,830
-No kidding.
-Kenny Bania.

85
00:04:44,996 --> 00:04:46,224
Bania?

86
00:04:47,236 --> 00:04:50,069
Hey, Jerry. How's it going?

87
00:04:50,236 --> 00:04:52,796
You gonna join us for dinner?
The duck here is the best.

88
00:04:52,956 --> 00:04:54,105
The best, Jerry.

89
00:04:58,436 --> 00:05:01,109
Excuse me.
l'm sorry to bother you.

90
00:05:01,276 --> 00:05:03,665
l noticed that you have
a textbook on tape.

91
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:05,155
May l ask where you got that?

92
00:05:05,316 --> 00:05:08,069
Reading for the Blind.
They can get any book on tape.

93
00:05:08,236 --> 00:05:10,796
l tell you, l am hooked
on these books on tape.

94
00:05:10,956 --> 00:05:14,505
Tell me about it. These things
have ruined me for Braille.

95
00:05:17,436 --> 00:05:18,630
Reading for the Blind?

96
00:05:18,956 --> 00:05:21,550
l take an eye test, l flunk it.
Next thing you know...

97
00:05:21,716 --> 00:05:25,425
...l am swinging to the sweet sounds
of risk management.

98
00:05:26,676 --> 00:05:30,271
-So l finally met the mentor.
-What's she like? lmpressive?

99
00:05:30,436 --> 00:05:33,633
Oh, yeah. She's dating Bania.

100
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,395
-Bania?
-Yeah.

101
00:05:36,556 --> 00:05:40,344
l had to spend two hours at dinner
last night with that specimen.

102
00:05:40,956 --> 00:05:42,309
-What'd you have?
-Chicken.

103
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:44,034
How could she look up
to a person...

104
00:05:44,196 --> 00:05:46,426
...who voluntarily
spends time with Bania?

105
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:47,790
-Marsala?
-Piccata.

106
00:05:47,956 --> 00:05:50,675
lf anything,
l should be dating a mentor...

107
00:05:50,836 --> 00:05:54,033
...and Bania should be
setting pins at a bowling alley.

108
00:05:54,716 --> 00:05:57,833
-All right. l got a test to fail.
-Hey, good luck with that.

109
00:05:57,996 --> 00:06:00,146
Thanks. Dad.

110
00:06:00,316 --> 00:06:02,307
What are you,
in an athletic sweat suit?

111
00:06:02,476 --> 00:06:03,670
What are you doing here?

112
00:06:03,836 --> 00:06:05,827
Came to get his check
for the banquet hall.

113
00:06:05,996 --> 00:06:11,707
You know, l got 1 83 responses.
Oh, it's gonna be a rager.

114
00:06:12,236 --> 00:06:15,592
Kramer, how are you gonna cook
Jewish delicacies for 1 83 people?

115
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:19,147
You're right. That's a lot of pupiks.

116
00:06:19,756 --> 00:06:21,872
Frank, you know anybody
who can help me cook?

117
00:06:22,036 --> 00:06:23,674
Cook? No. l don't know any cooks.

118
00:06:23,836 --> 00:06:26,111
l don't know anything
about cooking!

119
00:06:27,636 --> 00:06:28,910
What's the matter with him?

120
00:06:29,276 --> 00:06:32,825
My dad was a cook
during the Korean War.

121
00:06:32,996 --> 00:06:35,351
Something very bad happened.

122
00:06:35,516 --> 00:06:37,666
Ever since,
you can't get him near a kitchen.

123
00:06:37,836 --> 00:06:39,906
-Shell-shocked?
-Oh, yeah.

124
00:06:40,076 --> 00:06:42,351
But that has nothing to do with it.

125
00:06:44,116 --> 00:06:46,391
Good work, guys.
That ought to do it for today.

126
00:06:46,556 --> 00:06:47,750
-Alrighty?
-Wait.

127
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:50,555
You didn't ask me about my ideas.

128
00:06:50,876 --> 00:06:53,106
Oh, Eddie, well, it's your first day.

129
00:06:53,276 --> 00:06:56,154
-l'm ready.
-Okay.

130
00:06:58,396 --> 00:07:02,389
'' lt's a hot night. The mind races.

131
00:07:03,876 --> 00:07:05,389
You think about your knife...

132
00:07:07,476 --> 00:07:10,866
...the only friend
who hasn't betrayed you.

133
00:07:12,036 --> 00:07:15,585
The only friend
who won't be dead by sun-up.

134
00:07:18,076 --> 00:07:23,673
Sleep tight, mates,
in your quilted chambray nightshirts.''

135
00:07:29,556 --> 00:07:32,116
What am l gonna do?
He is a disaster.

136
00:07:32,276 --> 00:07:36,906
Well, if he's doing that bad, maybe
he's in line for another promotion.

137
00:07:37,676 --> 00:07:40,474
You know what?
You are exactly right.

138
00:07:40,636 --> 00:07:42,945
That is what l should do.
l should promote him.

139
00:07:43,356 --> 00:07:46,871
l'll give him another office
on another floor, and he can sit there...

140
00:07:47,036 --> 00:07:50,346
...with his nice title
and his bayonet...

141
00:07:50,516 --> 00:07:52,905
...and stop freaking me out.

142
00:07:56,156 --> 00:07:57,987
Nothing at all.

143
00:07:59,836 --> 00:08:02,396
Well, George,
your vision is quite impaired.

144
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,953
lf you'll just sign this
insurance form. Here's a pen.

145
00:08:16,276 --> 00:08:18,232
You're a very handsome man,
by the way.

146
00:08:24,436 --> 00:08:27,189
What the hell is going on here?

147
00:08:29,956 --> 00:08:31,674
Look out!

148
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:39,431
-What are you doing?
-l got three kitchens going.

149
00:08:39,836 --> 00:08:44,193
l got brisket going at Newman's,
l got kugel working at Mrs. Zanfino's...

150
00:08:44,356 --> 00:08:45,675
...and this is kreplach.

151
00:08:45,836 --> 00:08:48,714
Here, try some of this.

152
00:08:48,876 --> 00:08:52,949
-No, l don't want to.
-Eat, eat, you're skin and bones.

153
00:08:56,556 --> 00:08:59,514
-Oh, this is awful.
-Oh, Jerry, it's kreplach.

154
00:08:59,676 --> 00:09:02,065
lt's an acquired taste. Yeah.

155
00:09:09,836 --> 00:09:11,189
Did you follow the recipe?

156
00:09:11,356 --> 00:09:12,994
The recipe was for four to six.

157
00:09:13,156 --> 00:09:16,068
l had to multiply it for 1 83 people.

158
00:09:16,236 --> 00:09:18,386
l guess l got confused.

159
00:09:19,596 --> 00:09:20,870
lt tastes like dirt.

160
00:09:21,036 --> 00:09:23,755
Well, l also dropped it
on the way over.

161
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:25,907
Jerry, l'm in trouble.
l got no skills.

162
00:09:26,076 --> 00:09:30,513
l can't peel, l can't chop,
l can't grate, l can't mince.

163
00:09:30,676 --> 00:09:32,871
l got no sense of flavour, obviously.

164
00:09:34,596 --> 00:09:35,711
l gotta talk to Frank.

165
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:37,628
-You can't--
-l gotta talk to him.

166
00:09:37,796 --> 00:09:39,070
l know that he can help me--

167
00:09:39,236 --> 00:09:41,796
l think there's a dead animal
in the elevator.

168
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,231
My stuffed cabbage.

169
00:09:47,636 --> 00:09:50,389
-So great dinner last night.
-Yeah, it was all right.

170
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:52,945
l told Cynthia we'd double
with her and Bania Saturday...

171
00:09:53,116 --> 00:09:55,311
-...and then catch his act.
-No. No.

172
00:09:55,476 --> 00:09:58,468
-No way. No Bania.
-What?

173
00:09:58,636 --> 00:10:01,946
Have you seen his act? He's got
a 1 2-minute bit about Ovaltine.

174
00:10:02,116 --> 00:10:04,072
He's a pug, a patsy, a hack.

175
00:10:04,636 --> 00:10:06,308
Cynthia would not date a hack.

176
00:10:06,476 --> 00:10:08,467
Would. Does. ls.

177
00:10:11,276 --> 00:10:12,675
Before we get started...

178
00:10:12,836 --> 00:10:14,986
...l am happy to tell you
that Eddie Sherman...

179
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,192
...is no longer writing
for this catalogue.

180
00:10:17,356 --> 00:10:19,392
-lt's about time.
-He's upstairs.

181
00:10:19,556 --> 00:10:21,865
l made him director
of corporate development.

182
00:10:22,436 --> 00:10:24,028
You promoted him?

183
00:10:24,196 --> 00:10:25,515
Well, no. l would hardly--

184
00:10:25,676 --> 00:10:29,908
-l bust my hump every day.
-Relax.

185
00:10:30,076 --> 00:10:33,910
As far as l'm concerned,
you and your deranged protégé...

186
00:10:34,076 --> 00:10:36,795
...can run the catalogue
by yourselves.

187
00:10:36,956 --> 00:10:38,435
l quit!

188
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:39,790
-l'm with him.
-Me too.

189
00:10:39,956 --> 00:10:42,072
What? Hey.

190
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:45,912
Hey. Hey!

191
00:10:47,676 --> 00:10:49,268
Chapter one.

192
00:10:49,436 --> 00:10:53,429
In order to manage risk,
we must first understand risk.

193
00:10:53,796 --> 00:10:55,514
How do you spot risk?

194
00:10:55,676 --> 00:10:59,510
How do you av oid risk,
and what mak es it so risky?

195
00:10:59,676 --> 00:11:02,588
-This guy sounds like me.
-To understand risk, we must first...

196
00:11:02,756 --> 00:11:04,747
-... define risk. Risk...
-This is horrible.

197
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:07,430
-... existed virtually--
-Stop it. Stop it. Shut up!

198
00:11:08,316 --> 00:11:10,432
Come on, Frank, l need you.

199
00:11:10,596 --> 00:11:12,552
l mean, the war was 50 years ago.

200
00:11:12,716 --> 00:11:16,948
ln my mind,
there's a war still going on.

201
00:11:17,116 --> 00:11:18,549
All right, what happened?

202
00:11:18,716 --> 00:11:20,627
What is it that you can't get over?

203
00:11:33,316 --> 00:11:36,467
lnchon, Korea, 1 950.

204
00:11:36,636 --> 00:11:40,151
l was the best cook
Uncle Sam ever saw.

205
00:11:40,476 --> 00:11:43,991
Slinging hash for the fighting 1 03rd.

206
00:11:44,156 --> 00:11:47,751
As we marched north,
our supply lines were getting thin.

207
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,384
Well, one day,
a couple of Gl's found a crate.

208
00:11:50,556 --> 00:11:53,673
lnside was 600 pounds
of prime Texas steer.

209
00:11:53,836 --> 00:11:56,145
At least, it once was prime.

210
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:58,193
The use date
was three weeks past.

211
00:11:59,036 --> 00:12:02,312
But l was arrogant. l was brash.

212
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:06,032
l thought if l used
just the right spices...

213
00:12:08,276 --> 00:12:10,392
...cooked it long enough....

214
00:12:13,036 --> 00:12:14,230
What happened?

215
00:12:14,396 --> 00:12:17,433
l went too far. l overseasoned it.

216
00:12:20,956 --> 00:12:23,106
Men were keeling over
all around me.

217
00:12:24,556 --> 00:12:27,548
l can still hear
the retching and screaming.

218
00:12:34,876 --> 00:12:36,867
Frank!

219
00:12:37,516 --> 00:12:42,226
l sent 1 6 of my own men
to the latrines that night.

220
00:12:43,876 --> 00:12:45,355
They were just boys.

221
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:47,711
Frank, you were a boy too.

222
00:12:47,876 --> 00:12:51,186
And it was war.
That was a crazy time for everyone.

223
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:53,193
Tell that to Bobby Colby.

224
00:12:53,796 --> 00:12:58,916
All that kid wanted to do was go home.
Well, he went home, all right.

225
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:01,750
With a crater in his colon
the size of a cutlet.

226
00:13:02,836 --> 00:13:05,555
They had to sit him on a cork
for the 1 8-hour flight home.

227
00:13:05,716 --> 00:13:10,107
Frank, now listen to me. Two hundred
Jewish singles need you.

228
00:13:10,276 --> 00:13:12,551
This is your chance
to make it all right again.

229
00:13:12,956 --> 00:13:17,029
No. No. l'll never cook again.

230
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:19,994
Never! Now get out of my house!

231
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:23,793
Out. Get out. Go.

232
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:31,189
So you saw Bania's act.

233
00:13:31,756 --> 00:13:34,145
He got two minutes
into that Ovaltine thing...

234
00:13:34,316 --> 00:13:36,784
...and l just couldn't take it anymore.

235
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:41,070
l told you. lt's like getting beaten
with a bag of oranges.

236
00:13:41,476 --> 00:13:43,512
Why is he so obsessed
with Ovaltine?

237
00:13:43,676 --> 00:13:47,510
He just thinks that anything
that dissolves in milk is funny.

238
00:13:47,676 --> 00:13:51,988
Anyway, Cynthia and l got into
this big argument afterwards...

239
00:13:52,316 --> 00:13:54,830
-...and l think it's over.
-No more mentor?

240
00:13:54,996 --> 00:13:58,466
-Looks that way.
-At least you and l are okay again.

241
00:13:58,636 --> 00:14:00,354
Actually, l was kind of thinking...

242
00:14:00,516 --> 00:14:03,110
...that maybe we shouldn't
see each other for a while.

243
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:04,311
Why?

244
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:07,434
Well, l'm feeling a little disoriented.

245
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:10,064
lt's just weird for me
not to have an advisor.

246
00:14:10,236 --> 00:14:12,875
l can tell you what to do.

247
00:14:14,076 --> 00:14:16,271
-lt's more than that.
-l can tell you what to think.

248
00:14:17,276 --> 00:14:18,709
l need someone l can trust.

249
00:14:23,036 --> 00:14:26,312
l got a big problem here, Jerry.
The tapes are worthless.

250
00:14:26,476 --> 00:14:29,070
Kind of in the middle
of something here, George.

251
00:14:36,716 --> 00:14:39,025
-George.
-l gotta run anyway.

252
00:14:39,196 --> 00:14:42,108
l can't believe you feel
you really need a mentor.

253
00:14:42,276 --> 00:14:46,064
l just need someone who can give me
some kind of direction.

254
00:14:47,556 --> 00:14:49,353
l'll see you.

255
00:14:49,516 --> 00:14:51,108
Yeah, see you.

256
00:14:51,276 --> 00:14:54,791
-So, what's your problem?
-No problem.

257
00:14:57,116 --> 00:15:01,428
l think l got something here
for the Bengalese galoshes.

258
00:15:03,516 --> 00:15:07,270
'' lt's tough keeping your feet dry...

259
00:15:07,436 --> 00:15:10,553
...when you're kicking in a skull.''

260
00:15:11,996 --> 00:15:16,035
You know, Eddie,
that might be just a tad harsh.

261
00:15:16,196 --> 00:15:18,073
For women's wear.

262
00:15:20,116 --> 00:15:22,949
Well, l'm not married to it.

263
00:15:23,596 --> 00:15:28,545
Well, in that case,
why don't we take the phrase:

264
00:15:29,276 --> 00:15:30,709
'' Kicking in a skull'' ...

265
00:15:30,876 --> 00:15:33,310
...and we tweak it.

266
00:15:33,476 --> 00:15:37,435
You know, just a hair,
to something like what?

267
00:15:37,596 --> 00:15:41,748
Like ''strolling through
a dewy meadow.''

268
00:15:42,596 --> 00:15:44,951
Dewy meadow.

269
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,269
Here's your omelette.

270
00:15:49,796 --> 00:15:52,629
-lt's dry.
-That's the way l always make it.

271
00:15:53,516 --> 00:15:55,507
Well, it sucks.

272
00:15:57,436 --> 00:15:59,347
What did you say?

273
00:15:59,556 --> 00:16:03,231
Your meatloaf is mushy,
your salmon croquettes are oily...

274
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:06,627
...and your eggplant parmigiana
is a disgrace to this house!

275
00:16:06,796 --> 00:16:11,506
Well, that's too bad, because l'm
the only one who cooks around here.

276
00:16:11,676 --> 00:16:14,986
Not anymore. Give me that spatula.

277
00:16:18,956 --> 00:16:21,516
l'm back, baby!

278
00:16:23,596 --> 00:16:26,588
You're sure, with your schedule,
you'd have time for a protégé?

279
00:16:26,956 --> 00:16:30,471
l'll make time. Because, Abby,
l was once like you.

280
00:16:30,636 --> 00:16:32,115
Wide-eyed, naive.

281
00:16:32,276 --> 00:16:35,348
l didn't know the first thing
about a subject as fundamental...

282
00:16:35,516 --> 00:16:39,065
...as risk management.

283
00:16:39,236 --> 00:16:41,431
l'm not familiar with it.
You'll have to explain.

284
00:16:41,596 --> 00:16:43,268
l'll tell you what.

285
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:45,347
Why don't you read this book...

286
00:16:45,516 --> 00:16:48,952
...and let's just see
if you can explain it to me.

287
00:16:49,516 --> 00:16:51,825
-All right.
-Okay.

288
00:16:52,796 --> 00:16:53,990
Hey, Jerry.

289
00:16:54,396 --> 00:16:56,785
-Hey, Bania.
-Did you hear what happened?

290
00:16:56,956 --> 00:16:59,675
The mentor saw my act.
She dumped me.

291
00:16:59,836 --> 00:17:01,269
Oh, that's a tough one.

292
00:17:01,436 --> 00:17:05,111
Maybe she's right.
Maybe l am a complete hack.

293
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:07,671
l'm the absolute worst.
The worst, Jerry.

294
00:17:07,836 --> 00:17:10,589
Well, it's just that you got
so many things with the milk.

295
00:17:10,756 --> 00:17:13,316
You got that Bosco bit,
you got your Nestlé's Quik bit.

296
00:17:13,476 --> 00:17:15,034
By the time you get to Ovaltine--

297
00:17:15,196 --> 00:17:17,790
You think you can give me
a hand with my material?

298
00:17:24,556 --> 00:17:27,389
-You still need a cook?
-Oh, yeah. Come on in, Frank.

299
00:17:27,556 --> 00:17:29,194
-You got T-Fal?
-Calphalon.

300
00:17:29,356 --> 00:17:32,314
-No. Follow me.
-Oh, yeah.

301
00:17:33,516 --> 00:17:34,949
Try that.

302
00:17:37,316 --> 00:17:39,511
''Why do they call it Ovaltine?

303
00:17:39,676 --> 00:17:42,748
The mug is round, the jar is round.

304
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:45,225
They should call it Roundtine.''

305
00:17:46,836 --> 00:17:49,794
That's gold, Jerry. Gold.

306
00:17:50,556 --> 00:17:56,791
Let's just replace '' hail of shrapnel''
and ''scar tissue'' ...

307
00:17:57,276 --> 00:18:01,588
...with ''string of pearls''
and '' raspberry scones.''

308
00:18:05,036 --> 00:18:06,754
George Costanza is your mentor?

309
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,952
Yeah. He's great.

310
00:18:09,116 --> 00:18:10,629
l am learning so much.

311
00:18:10,796 --> 00:18:13,913
About what? How to calculate
5 percent of a restaurant check?

312
00:18:14,996 --> 00:18:16,475
You know what your problem is?

313
00:18:16,636 --> 00:18:20,026
You just have no respect
for the protégé-mentor relationship.

314
00:18:20,196 --> 00:18:23,666
As a matter of fact,
l happen to have a protégé of my own.

315
00:18:25,436 --> 00:18:28,109
-Who?
-A Mr. Kenneth Bania.

316
00:18:28,276 --> 00:18:29,914
Bania?

317
00:18:30,836 --> 00:18:33,396
l'm gonna mentor
this kid to the top.

318
00:18:33,556 --> 00:18:37,629
Well, l don't think l wanna date
a mentor whose protégé is a hack.

319
00:18:37,796 --> 00:18:40,947
l don't think l wanna date a protégé
whose mentor is a Costanza.

320
00:18:42,876 --> 00:18:43,911
l don't know how...

321
00:18:44,076 --> 00:18:46,112
...but there's some chemistry
between us.

322
00:18:46,276 --> 00:18:48,471
We turned out
one hell of a catalogue.

323
00:18:48,996 --> 00:18:50,190
Cool.

324
00:18:51,316 --> 00:18:53,511
Hey, Ed, let me ask you something.

325
00:18:53,676 --> 00:18:58,033
What's with the fatigues
and all the psychotic imagery, huh?

326
00:18:58,756 --> 00:19:00,030
l don't wanna talk about it.

327
00:19:00,196 --> 00:19:03,666
Come on. Don't be a baby.

328
00:19:04,436 --> 00:19:08,509
l went out on a couple of dates
with this woman.

329
00:19:08,676 --> 00:19:10,826
l thought she really liked me.

330
00:19:11,396 --> 00:19:15,230
And then things kind of cooled off.

331
00:19:17,116 --> 00:19:18,310
That's it?

332
00:19:18,796 --> 00:19:21,435
Well, it's tough
meeting somebody you like...

333
00:19:21,596 --> 00:19:23,188
...let alone somebody Jewish.

334
00:19:30,716 --> 00:19:32,229
This food is fantastic.

335
00:19:32,396 --> 00:19:35,991
-Have you tried the hamantaschen?
-l can't get off the kishkes.

336
00:19:36,156 --> 00:19:37,953
-Hey, Jerry.
-Bania.

337
00:19:38,116 --> 00:19:39,674
l just stopped by to thank you.

338
00:19:39,836 --> 00:19:42,714
That risk-management stuff
you wrote for me is killer.

339
00:19:43,116 --> 00:19:44,515
Risk management?

340
00:19:44,676 --> 00:19:46,906
lt's gold, Jerry. Gold.

341
00:19:47,076 --> 00:19:50,148
l got all these corporate gigs,
and even Cynthia took me back.

342
00:19:50,316 --> 00:19:51,715
You went from the mailroom...

343
00:19:51,876 --> 00:19:54,549
...to director of corporate
development in two days?

344
00:19:55,396 --> 00:19:57,671
-That's right.
-How much are they paying you?

345
00:19:57,836 --> 00:19:59,064
l'll double it.

346
00:20:01,156 --> 00:20:04,831
-These latkes are going like hotcakes.
-Where's the powdered sugar?

347
00:20:05,436 --> 00:20:06,994
You know, you could take a break.

348
00:20:07,156 --> 00:20:11,195
No breaks. l feel reborn.
l'm like a phoenix rising from Arizona.

349
00:20:12,476 --> 00:20:13,625
Quitting?

350
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:17,266
l can't churn out
that pointless drivel anymore.

351
00:20:17,436 --> 00:20:20,587
What--? You can't quit.
You're all l've got.

352
00:20:20,756 --> 00:20:22,747
l need you.

353
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:25,874
Gross.

354
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,675
No!

355
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:43,954
No! Don't eat it. lt's no good.

356
00:20:44,116 --> 00:20:47,347
-No good. No good. No way.
-Frank, stop it.

357
00:20:47,516 --> 00:20:50,826
-Stop--
-No. No. No.

358
00:20:50,996 --> 00:20:52,668
Frank!

359
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:02,955
Our next speaker is George Costanza
on the subject of risk management.

360
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:12,467
''Ovaltine.

361
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:25,505
Have you ever had this stuff?

362
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:30,675
Why do they call it Ovaltine?

363
00:21:35,556 --> 00:21:37,433
They should call it Roundtine.

364
00:21:39,236 --> 00:21:41,545
You know what l'm talking about.''

365
00:21:42,956 --> 00:21:45,311
He's my protégé.
