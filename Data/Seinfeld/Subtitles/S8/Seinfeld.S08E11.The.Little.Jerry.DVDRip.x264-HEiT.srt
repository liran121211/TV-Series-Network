1
00:00:05,539 --> 00:00:07,370
What happened to you yesterday?

2
00:00:07,539 --> 00:00:10,736
-l waited for you. You never came.
-Oh, l'm sorry. l got really busy.

3
00:00:10,899 --> 00:00:13,367
-How long did you wait?
-Five minutes.

4
00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:17,769
-Five minutes? That's it?
-No difference. You never showed up.

5
00:00:17,939 --> 00:00:19,497
Well, l could have.

6
00:00:19,659 --> 00:00:23,572
l mean, last week we waited for that
friend of Kramer's for like 40 minutes.

7
00:00:23,739 --> 00:00:25,172
We barely knew the guy.

8
00:00:25,339 --> 00:00:27,853
The longer you know someone,
the shorter you wait?

9
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:31,011
-That's the way it works.
-When did you tell George to be here?

10
00:00:31,179 --> 00:00:33,454
l told him 1 0 minutes.
How long has it been?

11
00:00:33,619 --> 00:00:35,291
-About five.
-That's enough.

12
00:00:35,459 --> 00:00:36,778
Yeah.

13
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,779
Early. All right.

14
00:00:49,499 --> 00:00:50,898
Cold.

15
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:58,892
So l noticed you bounced
a cheque at the bodega.

16
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,890
-How did you know about that?
-Marcelino.

17
00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:04,893
He taped it up on his cash register
with all of the other bad cheques.

18
00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:06,538
He can't do that.

19
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:08,655
lt's the only way you'll learn.

20
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:14,699
Oh, these eggs are disgusting.

21
00:01:15,059 --> 00:01:18,096
Boy, this chicken should be
ashamed of himself.

22
00:01:18,259 --> 00:01:21,774
-Fantastic day, fantastic.
-What happened?

23
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:25,090
Well, first, l'm brushing my teeth
and this piece of apple skin...

24
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:28,569
...that must have been lodged
in there for days comes loose.

25
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:31,378
-Fantastic.
-Then l'm at the foundation--

26
00:01:31,539 --> 00:01:33,575
-You're still doing that?
-Once in a while.

27
00:01:33,739 --> 00:01:34,728
When you feel guilty.

28
00:01:34,899 --> 00:01:37,288
No, occasionally l forget
to let the machine pick up.

29
00:01:37,459 --> 00:01:40,337
Anyway, they made this large donation
to a women's prison...

30
00:01:40,499 --> 00:01:43,059
...and l get to go down there
and check it out.

31
00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:44,652
-That's caged heat.
-Yeah.

32
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:47,011
-What are you gonna do there?
-Nothing.

33
00:01:47,179 --> 00:01:51,331
Just stroll around the cellblocks,
maybe take in a shower fight.

34
00:01:53,139 --> 00:01:55,653
You got a bounced cheque
hanging up in the market...

35
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:58,014
-...over on Columbus.
-Yes, l know. l know.

36
00:01:58,179 --> 00:02:02,570
l noticed you chose
the clowns-with-balloon cheque design.

37
00:02:02,739 --> 00:02:04,889
lt was a mistake.
The bank sent the wrong ones.

38
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,415
Hey, look who's here.

39
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:10,252
Hey, Kurt, this is Jerry
and George and Kramer.

40
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:13,695
-Hey.
-Hey, Kurt, taste these eggs.

41
00:02:13,859 --> 00:02:16,498
No, l only eat cage-free, farm-fresh.

42
00:02:16,659 --> 00:02:20,698
Yes. These are sweatshop eggs.

43
00:02:28,219 --> 00:02:31,416
l gotta call the office, honey.
Will you order for me?

44
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:33,810
l'm a honey.

45
00:02:34,219 --> 00:02:35,618
He's pretty great, huh?

46
00:02:35,779 --> 00:02:37,929
ls he from the future?

47
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:43,374
No, he just shaves his head.
l think it's pretty gutsy.

48
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:47,617
Sweetheart, let me tell you
a little something about guts.

49
00:02:47,779 --> 00:02:50,054
This is guts.

50
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:54,850
What? Clinging to some scraps?

51
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,851
These are not scraps.

52
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:02,490
These are historic remains
of a once-great society of hair.

53
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,817
Did you guys stop
at the bodega today?

54
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:09,052
Some moron bounced
a clown cheque.

55
00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:17,335
l'm sorry about the cheque,
Marcelino.

56
00:03:17,779 --> 00:03:20,168
People seem to like the clowns.

57
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:24,529
Look, let me just give you the 40,
plus another 20 for your trouble.

58
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:26,178
Okay.

59
00:03:30,059 --> 00:03:34,098
-Are you gonna take the cheque down?
-Sorry, no. Store policy.

60
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:37,934
-But it's your bodega.
-Even l am not above the policy.

61
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:44,251
-And those are our tennis courts.
-Tennis courts?

62
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:47,695
What about the yard?
Where do they have the gang fights?

63
00:03:47,859 --> 00:03:51,932
There's no fights here, Mr. Costanza.
This is a minimum-security facility.

64
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:54,455
What about a hole?

65
00:03:54,619 --> 00:03:57,975
-Do you ever put anybody in the box?
-No.

66
00:03:58,659 --> 00:04:00,331
This prison stinks.

67
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:03,493
And finally the library,
which has been refurbished...

68
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:05,331
...thanks to your generous donation.

69
00:04:05,499 --> 00:04:08,218
-This is Celia Morgan, our librarian.
-Nice to meet you.

70
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:10,813
-l'll be in my office if you need me.
-Thanks, warden.

71
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:12,332
Betsy.

72
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:15,377
Betsy.

73
00:04:17,979 --> 00:04:19,571
Are you the head of the foundation?

74
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:23,095
Well, let's just say
it wouldn't exist without me.

75
00:04:25,299 --> 00:04:28,371
So you two shop at the same store?

76
00:04:28,539 --> 00:04:30,450
No, it's standard issue.

77
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,812
Oh, my God. You're in jail?

78
00:04:35,019 --> 00:04:37,453
That is so cool.

79
00:04:41,219 --> 00:04:42,732
You asked her out?

80
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:47,575
Well, not out. She's a prisoner.

81
00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:51,692
-How could you ask her out?
-Why not?

82
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:53,770
You wouldn't date
that girl from Queens...

83
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:55,975
...because you didn't wanna
cross the bridge.

84
00:04:56,139 --> 00:04:57,970
-lt was different.
-l'll say.

85
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:00,130
Jerry, l like being with her.

86
00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:03,371
Plus, l know where she is
all the time.

87
00:05:04,659 --> 00:05:06,570
l have relatively no competition.

88
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:09,575
You know how you live in fear
of the pop-in?

89
00:05:09,739 --> 00:05:11,013
-The pop-in.
-No pop-in...

90
00:05:11,179 --> 00:05:14,251
...no, '' ln the neighbourhood.''
No, '' l saw your light was on.''

91
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:16,808
And the best part is,
if things go really well....

92
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:19,652
-Conjugal visit?
-Don't jinx it. Don't.

93
00:05:20,739 --> 00:05:22,377
-Hey.
-Hey, what's up?

94
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:24,416
George is dating a convict.

95
00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:26,410
-What's she in for?
-Embezzlement.

96
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:28,615
Sounds like a nice girl.

97
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:31,811
ls it all right if l put some stuff
in your fridge? Mine's full.

98
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:34,254
Yeah, sure.
You don't even have a fridge, do you?

99
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:35,977
Well, not here.

100
00:05:37,859 --> 00:05:39,451
-Okay.
-Kramer....

101
00:05:39,619 --> 00:05:41,610
Wait a minute. Wait.
What the hell is that?

102
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:43,531
Well, it's chicken feed.

103
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:47,655
l sense something is afoot.

104
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:51,816
Yeah, l bought a chicken.

105
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,298
Allow me.

106
00:05:55,219 --> 00:05:56,447
Why?

107
00:05:57,299 --> 00:05:59,733
Cage-free, farm-fresh eggs.

108
00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:01,896
Allow me.

109
00:06:02,059 --> 00:06:04,175
-What are you? An idiot?
-No.

110
00:06:05,299 --> 00:06:07,255
Hold it. Hold it.
Here. l got it. Catch.

111
00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:13,210
Hey, driver's license.

112
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:17,533
Oh, my God.

113
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:20,736
-What?
-Your hair.

114
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:23,208
lt's so thick and lustrous.

115
00:06:24,619 --> 00:06:26,416
l mean, it was.

116
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:27,853
Well, it still is.

117
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:30,010
l shaved my head for my swim team.

118
00:06:30,179 --> 00:06:32,647
l just liked the way it looked,
so l kept it.

119
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:36,255
Are you saying
that l could be dating this hair?

120
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:38,888
l mean, with you under it?

121
00:06:55,339 --> 00:06:56,533
Hey.

122
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:58,849
ls that your chicken
making all that noise?

123
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:01,249
Oh, Jerry loves the morning.

124
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:04,328
-Who?
-Little Jerry Seinfeld.

125
00:07:06,019 --> 00:07:08,658
-l named my chicken after you.
-Thanks. That's very sweet.

126
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:10,457
But that is not a chicken.

127
00:07:10,619 --> 00:07:13,417
Of course it is.
l picked it out myself.

128
00:07:13,579 --> 00:07:15,217
Well, you picked out a rooster.

129
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:19,529
Well, that would explain
Little Jerry's poor egg production.

130
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:30,812
-This was fun.
-Yeah, l had a great time.

131
00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:32,571
Five minutes, Mr. Costanza.

132
00:07:32,739 --> 00:07:35,094
The whole hour just flew by.

133
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:38,331
-l'll get that.
-Thanks, Bobby.

134
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:41,612
Well, l guess
l'll see you in four days.

135
00:07:41,779 --> 00:07:43,849
Yeah. Go out
and have a ball with the guys.

136
00:07:44,019 --> 00:07:45,975
l'll be waiting right here for you.

137
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:48,255
Of course you will.

138
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:49,818
You're the best.

139
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:55,130
-Hello.
-Jerry...

140
00:07:55,299 --> 00:07:57,210
...Leo told us
he saw your bounced cheque.

141
00:07:57,379 --> 00:08:00,769
-Are you having money problems?
-l'm not having money problems.

142
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,850
Enough with the comedy.
You're very clever.

143
00:08:03,019 --> 00:08:04,691
You should look into advertising.

144
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:08,215
He never even called Ed Roydlick.
They were looking for someone.

145
00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:10,939
l'm not calling Ed Roydlick.
l'm doing fine.

146
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:13,613
That's it. l'm gonna send you $50.

147
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:15,531
You are not sending me $50.

148
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:18,167
We're sending you $50.
Morty, get me an envelope.

149
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:22,491
l swear to God, if you send me $50,
you are gonna be so sorry.

150
00:08:22,659 --> 00:08:25,332
-l don't see envelopes.
-They're right in front of you.

151
00:08:25,499 --> 00:08:28,093
Oh, for heaven's sakes.
Let me show you.

152
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:32,013
Ma, Ma, Ma!

153
00:08:34,859 --> 00:08:37,612
-How are the folks?
-Good.

154
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:40,816
-So movie tonight?
-l thought you were going with Celia.

155
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,412
l did. l'm back.

156
00:08:42,579 --> 00:08:45,047
l love this relationship.
l feel so liberated.

157
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:47,372
Having her in jail?

158
00:08:47,539 --> 00:08:50,895
Yeah, the only thing that bothers me
is l'm just coming up with this now.

159
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:55,455
Yeah, dating a convicted felon.
l don't know how you missed it.

160
00:08:55,979 --> 00:08:58,493
Here. Take a look at that.

161
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,733
Kurt's an organ donor.

162
00:09:01,579 --> 00:09:03,854
No, he's not bald.

163
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:05,896
Look, he's got a full head of hair.

164
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:08,175
So he just shaves his head
for no reason?

165
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,978
That's like using a wheelchair
for the fun of it.

166
00:09:12,099 --> 00:09:14,010
And he's growing it in just for me.

167
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:17,012
lt's mine. lt's all mine.

168
00:09:17,179 --> 00:09:21,138
-lt's just hair.
-No, it's not just hair. Look.

169
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:26,419
-lt's brown.
-lt's chestnut with auburn highlights.

170
00:09:26,739 --> 00:09:29,128
-So?
-You know, you're not around women.

171
00:09:29,299 --> 00:09:33,611
You don't know how important
a man's hair is.

172
00:09:38,259 --> 00:09:40,329
l'm sorry, George, but it's true.

173
00:09:40,499 --> 00:09:42,091
l knew it.

174
00:09:47,619 --> 00:09:48,608
Hey.

175
00:09:49,099 --> 00:09:52,171
-Hey, Kramer, nice rooster.
-Yeah.

176
00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:54,853
-What's his name?
-Well, this is Little Jerry Seinfeld.

177
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:59,729
Little Jerry Seinfeld.
Does he bounce cheques?

178
00:10:00,379 --> 00:10:02,290
Look, can't you take
Jerry's cheque down?

179
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:03,733
Sorry, Kramer, can't help.

180
00:10:04,819 --> 00:10:06,889
Hey, hey, Jerry. Come on.

181
00:10:07,059 --> 00:10:08,333
Oh, sorry.

182
00:10:08,499 --> 00:10:11,935
-l like the way he handles himself.
-Oh, yeah.

183
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:22,370
-Oh, it's coming in already.
-Yeah.

184
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:27,090
Wow, you have some
very nice little seedlings here.

185
00:10:30,099 --> 00:10:31,612
-What?
-Well, it doesn't seem...

186
00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:36,807
...to be coming in
so good over here or here.

187
00:10:37,619 --> 00:10:41,134
-What do you mean?
-Well, l don't know.

188
00:10:41,299 --> 00:10:43,449
How long have you been shaving
your head for?

189
00:10:43,619 --> 00:10:45,337
About three years.

190
00:10:46,739 --> 00:10:48,218
Oh, my God.

191
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:50,652
l'm going bald.

192
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:56,013
George, l'm so glad to see you.

193
00:10:56,179 --> 00:10:58,295
Hey, l brought you some cigarettes.

194
00:10:58,459 --> 00:11:00,415
You buy
yourself something nice.

195
00:11:00,579 --> 00:11:03,218
Good news. l'm up for parole.

196
00:11:06,259 --> 00:11:10,696
Parole? That's dynamite.

197
00:11:12,659 --> 00:11:14,251
Marcelino's taking down the cheque?

198
00:11:14,419 --> 00:11:17,775
Yeah, well, it comes down if Little
Jerry Seinfeld wins the cockfight.

199
00:11:17,939 --> 00:11:19,213
Great.

200
00:11:19,819 --> 00:11:21,047
What?

201
00:11:21,219 --> 00:11:24,336
Well, Marcelino, he has cockfights
in the back of his store.

202
00:11:24,499 --> 00:11:26,808
Yeah, so he says
if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins...

203
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:28,617
...the cheque comes down.

204
00:11:28,779 --> 00:11:30,292
Kramer, cockfighting is illegal.

205
00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:32,256
Only in the United States.

206
00:11:32,419 --> 00:11:34,979
-lt's inhumane.
-Jerry, it's not what you think it is.

207
00:11:35,139 --> 00:11:37,528
lt's two roosters pecking
at each other.

208
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:39,932
-What?
-Yeah.

209
00:11:40,979 --> 00:11:43,891
Well, l thought
they wore gloves and helmets.

210
00:11:44,059 --> 00:11:46,414
You know,
like American Gladiators.

211
00:11:46,579 --> 00:11:48,649
No, Kramer,
Little Jerry could get hurt.

212
00:11:48,819 --> 00:11:50,218
l left him with Marcelino.

213
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:52,976
My Little Jerry.

214
00:11:59,539 --> 00:12:01,450
Hey, did you get Little Jerry?
ls he okay?

215
00:12:01,619 --> 00:12:04,087
Oh, well, he's more than okay.
He won.

216
00:12:04,819 --> 00:12:07,287
-You let him fight?
-l couldn't get there in time.

217
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:09,415
But you should've seen
Little Jerry, Jerry.

218
00:12:09,579 --> 00:12:12,616
Flapping his wings
and strutting his stuff.

219
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:17,057
He was pecking and weaving
and bobbing and talking trash.

220
00:12:17,219 --> 00:12:20,529
He didn't even have to touch him.
The other rooster ran out of the ring.

221
00:12:21,739 --> 00:12:23,491
The whole fight lasted two seconds.

222
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:26,127
-How long do they usually last?
-Five seconds.

223
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:28,574
Marcelino says he's taking
your cheque down today.

224
00:12:28,739 --> 00:12:30,889
-Great.
-Hey.

225
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:33,937
-Celia is up for parole.
-Hey, Little Jerry won his cockfight.

226
00:12:34,099 --> 00:12:36,408
-What?
-Who?

227
00:12:37,739 --> 00:12:39,297
l'm too tired.

228
00:12:39,739 --> 00:12:41,934
Listen. l want you to come by later,
all right?

229
00:12:42,099 --> 00:12:43,851
-We're having a victory party.
-Okay.

230
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:49,291
lt's over, Jerry. She's getting out.

231
00:12:49,459 --> 00:12:50,892
l'm so sorry.

232
00:12:52,099 --> 00:12:53,691
She's been locked up for two years.

233
00:12:53,859 --> 00:12:56,657
She's gonna want to make up
for lost time.

234
00:12:56,819 --> 00:13:00,289
Dinners, movies, talking.

235
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,457
ln other words,
a normal relationship.

236
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:05,930
That's no good.

237
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:10,415
l've tried it straight, Jerry.
We've all seen the results.

238
00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:12,012
l think for me...

239
00:13:12,819 --> 00:13:15,174
...sick is the only way to go.

240
00:13:15,339 --> 00:13:17,295
Well, she'll still be an ex-con.

241
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:19,211
lt's not the same.

242
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:21,973
Hey, if you two
were meant to be together...

243
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:24,448
...l'm sure the cops
will pick her up on something.

244
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:29,457
Kurt?

245
00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:34,335
What's with the sweats?
Aren't we going out?

246
00:13:34,499 --> 00:13:36,490
l don't care.

247
00:13:37,979 --> 00:13:41,096
You got a big stain on your shirt.

248
00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:43,853
Oh, yeah, a meatball
fell out of my sandwich.

249
00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:45,577
You already ate?

250
00:13:45,739 --> 00:13:47,536
lt's from yesterday.

251
00:13:51,219 --> 00:13:53,779
Jerry, you missed a hell
of a cockfight last night.

252
00:13:53,939 --> 00:13:56,612
Then what is my cheque still doing up?
We had a deal.

253
00:13:56,779 --> 00:13:58,929
-Now we have a new deal.
-New deal?

254
00:13:59,099 --> 00:14:02,728
When Little Jerry Seinfeld is mine,
the cheque will be yours.

255
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:04,890
This is outrageous.

256
00:14:05,059 --> 00:14:06,253
Pack of Juicy Fruit.

257
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:09,449
-Eighty-five cents.
-Eighty-five cents?

258
00:14:09,699 --> 00:14:11,655
That is outrageous.

259
00:14:13,659 --> 00:14:16,378
Marcelino wants us
to sell him Little Jerry Seinfeld.

260
00:14:16,539 --> 00:14:17,972
That's out of the question.

261
00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:20,607
But cockfighting is
an illegal and immoral activity.

262
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:25,409
Yeah, if you've got a loser.
But Little Jerry was born to cockfight.

263
00:14:25,579 --> 00:14:27,012
No, no more cockfighting.

264
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:29,977
Let's just sell him to Marcelino
and be done with it.

265
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:31,697
-l think you're jealous.
-Of what?

266
00:14:33,579 --> 00:14:37,936
Yeah, you see in Little Jerry Seinfeld
the unlimited future you once had.

267
00:14:38,099 --> 00:14:40,772
Now, just because
Jerry Seinfeld is a has-been...

268
00:14:40,939 --> 00:14:43,328
...don't make
Little Jerry Seinfeld a never-was.

269
00:14:43,499 --> 00:14:45,376
-Kramer, give me that rooster.
-Never!

270
00:14:45,539 --> 00:14:48,975
You hate him because he's doing more
with your name than you ever will!

271
00:14:53,619 --> 00:14:57,134
George, Celia has listed you
as a character reference.

272
00:14:57,299 --> 00:15:01,577
Whatever you can tell us would be
helpful in her getting parole.

273
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:05,619
Well, anything l could do to help.

274
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:10,728
She's a wonderful girl.
Very smart, very crafty.

275
00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:13,449
Does she have any plans
after she's released?

276
00:15:13,619 --> 00:15:15,450
Plans. Schemes.

277
00:15:15,619 --> 00:15:18,736
She keeps talking about getting
back together with her old friends.

278
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:21,697
You know, ''the gang,''
she likes to call them.

279
00:15:21,859 --> 00:15:25,135
Yeah, they're hatching something.
You can count on that.

280
00:15:28,379 --> 00:15:32,338
Jerry, tomorrow night is fight night.
Where's my rooster?

281
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:34,694
-Kramer won't sell.
-Tell you what l'm gonna do.

282
00:15:34,859 --> 00:15:36,611
l'm gonna take down
your cheque anyway.

283
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:38,053
Well, thank you, Marcelino.

284
00:15:38,219 --> 00:15:40,972
Well, perhaps some day
you will do me a favour.

285
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:42,367
And that day is today.

286
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:45,537
Little Jerry Seinfeld must go down...

287
00:15:45,699 --> 00:15:47,929
...in the third round
of tomorrow's main event.

288
00:15:48,099 --> 00:15:50,738
-You want Little Jerry to take a dive?
-Not so loud.

289
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:53,777
First of all, l don't think
you can make a rooster take a dive.

290
00:15:53,939 --> 00:15:56,009
-Can too.
-Second of all...

291
00:15:56,179 --> 00:15:57,771
...Jerry Seinfeld, big or little...

292
00:15:57,939 --> 00:16:00,328
...doesn't go down for anyone,
anywhere, at any time.

293
00:16:00,499 --> 00:16:02,569
Now, l'd appreciate it
if you'd please leave.

294
00:16:02,739 --> 00:16:06,129
Big Jerry is making
a big mistake, Jerry.

295
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,130
We'll see about that.

296
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:13,734
Kramer, l'm coming up.
We got a cockfight to win.

297
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:15,173
Okay.

298
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:19,293
Elaine said you would be
the best person l could talk to.

299
00:16:19,539 --> 00:16:23,373
Yeah, classic horseshoe pattern.

300
00:16:23,539 --> 00:16:25,450
-l've seen a lot of this.
-Oh, God.

301
00:16:25,619 --> 00:16:27,689
No, no, Kurt, wrong attitude.

302
00:16:27,859 --> 00:16:30,134
-You should be happy.
-Why should l be happy?

303
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:32,210
You've still got
pretty good coverage.

304
00:16:32,379 --> 00:16:36,258
Once the enemy advances
beyond this perimeter...

305
00:16:37,659 --> 00:16:39,377
...then you won't be Kurt anymore.

306
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:41,088
What will l be?

307
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:51,574
-How long do l have?
-Fourteen months, maybe 1 0.

308
00:16:51,739 --> 00:16:54,299
-ls there anything l can do?
-Yes...

309
00:16:55,059 --> 00:16:56,253
...live, damn it.

310
00:16:56,419 --> 00:17:01,288
Live every precious moment as
if this was the last year of your life...

311
00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:03,051
...because in many ways...

312
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:05,128
...it is.

313
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:09,818
Excuse me.

314
00:17:12,659 --> 00:17:14,650
Celia, what are you doing here?

315
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:17,287
Well, l didn't get my parole,
so l busted out.

316
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:19,495
And you just decided to pop in?

317
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:29,737
-Kurt.
-Elaine, will you marry me?

318
00:17:31,859 --> 00:17:33,975
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

319
00:17:35,619 --> 00:17:37,450
-He's looking good, huh, Jerry?
-Yeah.

320
00:17:38,019 --> 00:17:40,055
All right.
l think that's enough for today.

321
00:17:43,379 --> 00:17:46,052
Little Jerry is a lean, mean,
pecking machine.

322
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:50,136
-What are you doing with that?
-l'm just gonna heat this up.

323
00:17:50,299 --> 00:17:52,335
Make a little hot tub for Little Jerry.

324
00:17:52,979 --> 00:17:54,617
Hey, Kramer...

325
00:17:55,299 --> 00:17:56,812
-...be careful.
-Yeah.

326
00:17:57,699 --> 00:17:58,893
-Hey.
-Hey, guess what.

327
00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:02,096
Little Jerry ran from here
to Newman's in under 30 seconds.

328
00:18:02,259 --> 00:18:04,614
-ls that good?
-l don't know.

329
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:08,179
-Where have you been?
-Celia broke out of prison.

330
00:18:08,899 --> 00:18:10,890
l'm at home,
she shows up at the door.

331
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:14,608
-Oh, my God, the break out pop-in.
-Yeah.

332
00:18:14,779 --> 00:18:16,007
And, Jerry, listen to this.

333
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:18,932
l've discovered something better
than conjugal-visit sex.

334
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:21,135
Fugitive sex.

335
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:22,971
-lt's like every time--
-George.

336
00:18:23,139 --> 00:18:25,972
This is a little too much.
Escape convicts, fugitive sex....

337
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:27,572
l got a cockfight to focus on.

338
00:18:32,899 --> 00:18:35,208
Hey, hey, Kurt, slow down.

339
00:18:35,379 --> 00:18:37,768
l can't just marry you.

340
00:18:37,939 --> 00:18:40,658
l mean, l need some fiancée time.

341
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:43,891
l need some
make-my-girlfriends-jealous time.

342
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:45,617
Plus, you want to get to know me.

343
00:18:45,779 --> 00:18:48,657
Yeah, yeah, that too.

344
00:18:48,819 --> 00:18:52,255
-Well, how much time?
-l don't know. A year?

345
00:18:52,419 --> 00:18:53,977
No, no, no, it has to be now.

346
00:18:56,019 --> 00:18:58,408
Could l see the ring again?

347
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:04,771
So you're actually considering it?

348
00:19:04,939 --> 00:19:08,090
Well, it will be a couple of years
before he's completely bald.

349
00:19:08,259 --> 00:19:09,658
Those will be good times.

350
00:19:09,819 --> 00:19:12,652
Marriage is a big step, Elaine.
Your life will totally change.

351
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:15,652
Jerry, it's 3:30 in the morning.
l'm at a cockfight.

352
00:19:15,819 --> 00:19:17,411
What am l clinging to?

353
00:19:19,699 --> 00:19:20,688
-Hey.
-Hey.

354
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:22,417
-Sorry l'm late.
-Where's Celia?

355
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:25,776
She didn't wanna come.
She's not really into sports.

356
00:19:26,059 --> 00:19:28,892
-Hey, how's he doing?
-Well, he's got a big sweat going.

357
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:32,529
Oh, this came for you Express Mail.
lt's from your parents.

358
00:19:32,699 --> 00:19:33,814
-Hi.
-Hi.

359
00:19:34,499 --> 00:19:37,457
'' Fifty dollars.''
l don't believe this.

360
00:19:38,059 --> 00:19:40,050
There's Marcelino.

361
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:43,699
Look at the size of his bird.

362
00:19:43,859 --> 00:19:47,215
That looks like a dog
with a glove on his head.

363
00:19:50,699 --> 00:19:52,451
Hi, is George back
from the cockfight?

364
00:19:52,619 --> 00:19:54,655
l've got to thank him.
He changed my life.

365
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,650
Must've been a good fight.
He's not back.

366
00:19:56,819 --> 00:19:57,808
Damn.

367
00:19:58,219 --> 00:20:00,414
Sorry to bother you, Mr. Costanza.

368
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:02,649
Well, well, well, look who's here.

369
00:20:02,819 --> 00:20:04,013
Oh, man.

370
00:20:04,179 --> 00:20:05,851
Mr. Costanza, you're under arrest...

371
00:20:06,019 --> 00:20:08,294
...for aiding and abetting
a known fugitive.

372
00:20:08,459 --> 00:20:10,575
-l'm not George Costanza.
-Save it.

373
00:20:10,739 --> 00:20:14,368
We know you're bald.
We know it's you. Let's go.

374
00:20:17,219 --> 00:20:18,732
Okay. l got the whole scoop.

375
00:20:18,899 --> 00:20:21,208
Marcelino flew the bird in
from Ecuador.

376
00:20:21,379 --> 00:20:23,813
-He's 68-0.
-He's a ringer.

377
00:20:23,979 --> 00:20:25,412
Where's the tamale guy?

378
00:20:27,739 --> 00:20:29,809
Little Jerry's gonna get
his clock cleaned.

379
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:32,015
l've gotta get him out of there.

380
00:20:34,219 --> 00:20:36,813
Little Jerry!

381
00:20:36,979 --> 00:20:39,891
Kramer!

382
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:45,610
Stop the fight!

383
00:20:46,699 --> 00:20:49,896
Tamale!

384
00:21:10,579 --> 00:21:12,649
Why did you get into
a fistfight with the cop?

385
00:21:12,819 --> 00:21:15,094
-You were innocent.
-They thought l was George.

386
00:21:15,259 --> 00:21:17,170
l'm not that bald.

387
00:21:17,339 --> 00:21:20,888
And l have too little time left
to take that crap, so l slugged him.

388
00:21:21,339 --> 00:21:23,295
How long are you
gonna be in here for?

389
00:21:23,459 --> 00:21:27,896
Well, my lawyer says 1 4 months,
but with good behaviour maybe 1 0.

390
00:21:29,979 --> 00:21:33,210
-So 1 0 to 1 4 months?
-Yeah.
