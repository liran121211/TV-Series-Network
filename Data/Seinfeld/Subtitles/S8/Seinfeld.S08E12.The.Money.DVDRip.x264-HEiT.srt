1
00:00:04,836 --> 00:00:07,304
lf the big man wants
a new scoreboard...

2
00:00:07,476 --> 00:00:09,387
...l don't wanna be the one
to tell him no.

3
00:00:09,556 --> 00:00:12,116
No one in the park is gonna be able
to see it from there.

4
00:00:12,276 --> 00:00:15,985
Well, why don't we just
put a monitor in the skybox?

5
00:00:16,596 --> 00:00:18,109
Hey, George...

6
00:00:18,276 --> 00:00:20,995
...the ocean called.
They're running out of shrimp.

7
00:00:31,556 --> 00:00:34,389
''The ocean called.
They're running out of shrimp.''

8
00:00:34,556 --> 00:00:36,308
You got your shrimp.

9
00:00:37,676 --> 00:00:42,306
Oh, yes.
That's what l should have said.

10
00:00:42,476 --> 00:00:44,034
Damn it!

11
00:00:48,516 --> 00:00:50,666
''The ocean called,
they're running out of shrimp''?

12
00:00:50,876 --> 00:00:52,673
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
but then l said to him:

13
00:00:52,836 --> 00:00:56,306
''Oh, yeah? Well, the jerk store called,
and they're running out of you.''

14
00:00:57,116 --> 00:00:59,391
Really? That's great.
You said that to him?

15
00:00:59,556 --> 00:01:02,628
Well, actually, l thought it up
on the way over here.

16
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:04,752
Oh, that's not quite the same.

17
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:06,827
No, no, it's not.

18
00:01:06,996 --> 00:01:10,750
You don't know this guy.
lt would have been so sweet.

19
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:13,191
-l'm gonna grab a can of balls.
-All right.

20
00:01:13,356 --> 00:01:16,428
Hello. My name is Milos.
How can l help you?

21
00:01:16,596 --> 00:01:17,631
l need a can of balls.

22
00:01:17,796 --> 00:01:21,152
A can of balls for the nice guy.

23
00:01:22,076 --> 00:01:25,307
You don't plan to hit these balls
with that racket, do you?

24
00:01:30,796 --> 00:01:32,627
Checking out the staff picks,
Miss Benes?

25
00:01:32,796 --> 00:01:35,071
Oh, hey. Yeah, yeah.

26
00:01:35,316 --> 00:01:36,829
This Vincent guy,
he is the best.

27
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:38,748
He and l have
the same taste in movies.

28
00:01:38,916 --> 00:01:41,430
Well, Vincent is an art-house goon.

29
00:01:41,596 --> 00:01:43,188
l stick to the Gene rack.

30
00:01:43,356 --> 00:01:47,793
Gene? Oh, he's so stupid
and mainstream.

31
00:01:47,956 --> 00:01:50,629
l've seen all of these,
so l went with the Kramer pick.

32
00:01:50,796 --> 00:01:53,708
The Other Side of Darkness.
l never heard of that one.

33
00:01:53,876 --> 00:01:56,026
Yeah, it went straight to video.

34
00:01:57,636 --> 00:01:59,354
That makes me the premiere.

35
00:02:03,516 --> 00:02:06,269
Jerry? Have you ever seen the movie
The Other Side of Darkness?

36
00:02:06,436 --> 00:02:08,666
-No.
-lt's about this woman in a coma.

37
00:02:08,836 --> 00:02:13,466
Well, l couldn't finish watching it,
so l want you to read this.

38
00:02:14,116 --> 00:02:15,469
'' l, Cosmo Kramer...

39
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:18,787
...having just seen the movie
The Other Side of Darkness...

40
00:02:18,956 --> 00:02:23,029
...and not wanting to be in a coma
like that lady in the movie...

41
00:02:23,196 --> 00:02:25,949
...hereby want Jerry Seinfeld to
remove my life support...

42
00:02:26,116 --> 00:02:31,474
...feeding machine, lung blower,
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.''

43
00:02:31,636 --> 00:02:33,433
-Can you do that for me?
-l don't know if...

44
00:02:33,596 --> 00:02:36,349
...what you have here constitutes
a legally binding document.

45
00:02:36,516 --> 00:02:38,108
Well, l'm gonna type it up.

46
00:02:38,636 --> 00:02:41,309
Yes, of course, but even so,
you may wanna talk to a lawyer.

47
00:02:41,636 --> 00:02:44,594
Yeah, well, Jackie Chiles,
he put a restraining order on me.

48
00:02:44,756 --> 00:02:47,316
l'm not allowed within 200 feet
of his office.

49
00:02:47,476 --> 00:02:49,546
l couldn't even give him
his Christmas present.

50
00:02:50,756 --> 00:02:52,075
Oh, hey, new racket, huh?

51
00:02:52,236 --> 00:02:55,706
Yeah, l wasn't gonna get it, but this
guy, Milos, who runs the pro shop...

52
00:02:55,996 --> 00:02:57,145
...he really recommended it.

53
00:02:57,316 --> 00:02:59,671
ln fact, it's the only racket
he plays with.

54
00:02:59,836 --> 00:03:02,066
You're not gonna need
this anymore.

55
00:03:03,796 --> 00:03:05,832
Hey, this is the Z page
of my address book.

56
00:03:05,996 --> 00:03:08,908
Oh, yeah, l put all your Z's on
the weights-and-measures page.

57
00:03:16,676 --> 00:03:22,387
Bravo, Vincent. Bravo.

58
00:03:27,356 --> 00:03:30,428
-What?
-Did you enjoy the movie?

59
00:03:30,956 --> 00:03:32,833
Who is this?

60
00:03:33,316 --> 00:03:35,113
It's Vincent.

61
00:03:35,276 --> 00:03:37,949
Of Vincent's picks?

62
00:03:38,196 --> 00:03:39,834
The same.

63
00:03:43,036 --> 00:03:44,674
He called you?

64
00:03:44,956 --> 00:03:46,674
Must have got my number
off the computer.

65
00:03:46,836 --> 00:03:48,667
We ended up talking
for like two hours.

66
00:03:48,836 --> 00:03:50,667
To a guy you've never met?

67
00:03:50,836 --> 00:03:53,475
Your screening process is getting
ever more rigorous.

68
00:03:54,476 --> 00:03:56,990
l'm trying to meet him.
He's never at the video store.

69
00:03:57,156 --> 00:03:58,953
They said he sets his own hours.

70
00:04:00,236 --> 00:04:02,830
-Little help! Hey.
-Here.

71
00:04:02,996 --> 00:04:04,748
Thank you.

72
00:04:05,196 --> 00:04:08,825
Oh, my God, that guy is terrible.

73
00:04:09,396 --> 00:04:12,274
Hey, how come we played at this
crummy place instead of your club?

74
00:04:12,436 --> 00:04:14,472
George used up
all my guest passes already.

75
00:04:15,796 --> 00:04:17,468
-Come on.
-Thank you.

76
00:04:19,076 --> 00:04:20,634
Here you go.

77
00:04:23,156 --> 00:04:24,350
Milos?

78
00:04:24,716 --> 00:04:28,106
Oh, hey. How you doing?

79
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:36,306
Okay. We should wrap it up here.

80
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,993
So he's bad. What do you care?

81
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:44,750
Elaine, l paid $200 for this racket...

82
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:47,749
...because he said
it's the only one he plays with.

83
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,793
He could have played just as well
with a log.

84
00:04:52,516 --> 00:04:55,792
Hey. All right, l talked to
this lawyer guy, Shellbach.

85
00:04:55,956 --> 00:04:58,993
He's gonna set me up, but you gotta
come with me to be the executor.

86
00:04:59,156 --> 00:05:00,430
The executor of what?

87
00:05:00,596 --> 00:05:02,905
Kramer wants to die with dignity.

88
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,147
There's a feather in your cap.

89
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:08,633
l don't wanna be a vegetable, Elaine.
l just want out.

90
00:05:11,036 --> 00:05:15,552
Sometimes in life,
the gods smile upon you, my friends.

91
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:19,314
Did you get someone to take
that Canadian quarter?

92
00:05:20,836 --> 00:05:22,792
l got another meeting with Reilly...

93
00:05:23,316 --> 00:05:26,592
...a whole new audience, and l bet
l can get him to try that line again.

94
00:05:26,756 --> 00:05:27,825
Who's Reilly?

95
00:05:27,996 --> 00:05:30,226
George was scarfing shrimp
at this meeting, and this guy says:

96
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:32,626
'' Hey, George, the ocean called.
They're running out of shrimp.''

97
00:05:39,436 --> 00:05:40,835
Listen to the comeback:

98
00:05:40,996 --> 00:05:45,467
''Oh, yeah? Well, the jerk store called.
They're running out of you.''

99
00:05:48,276 --> 00:05:49,914
What? You gotta be kidding me.

100
00:05:50,076 --> 00:05:51,748
How about this one? How about:

101
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:56,228
''Your cranium called.
lt's got some space to rent.''

102
00:05:58,036 --> 00:05:59,947
-What does that mean?
-Hey, here you go:

103
00:06:00,116 --> 00:06:02,584
'' Hey, Reilly, the zoo called.
You're due back by 6.''

104
00:06:02,756 --> 00:06:05,873
No, no, no, you're not helping me.

105
00:06:06,036 --> 00:06:10,348
Look, just tell him you had sex
with his wife. That'll get him.

106
00:06:11,276 --> 00:06:13,631
l'm not looking for another line.
l got the line.

107
00:06:13,796 --> 00:06:15,707
Look, George, just think about it,
you know?

108
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:18,151
You're married, how would you feel
if somebody says...

109
00:06:18,316 --> 00:06:19,795
-...they just had sex--
-You see?

110
00:06:19,956 --> 00:06:21,947
This is why l hate writing
with a large group.

111
00:06:22,116 --> 00:06:24,835
Everybody has their own opinions,
and it all gets homogenized...

112
00:06:24,996 --> 00:06:26,634
...and you lose the whole edge of it.

113
00:06:26,796 --> 00:06:30,914
l'm going with ''jerk store.''
''Jerk store'' is the line.

114
00:06:31,396 --> 00:06:34,706
Jerk store. Yes.

115
00:06:43,876 --> 00:06:45,673
Did you take this out of
the garbage?

116
00:06:45,836 --> 00:06:47,508
lt's still got spring in the strings.

117
00:06:47,676 --> 00:06:50,065
Oh, Jerry, this is a piece of junk.

118
00:06:50,236 --> 00:06:52,511
How are you gonna be
the executor of my living will?

119
00:06:52,676 --> 00:06:55,236
You see, you can't let go.

120
00:06:56,996 --> 00:07:01,831
Trust me, Kramer, given the
legal opportunity, l will kill you.

121
00:07:02,116 --> 00:07:04,107
l wish l could believe you.

122
00:07:04,516 --> 00:07:07,189
Hey, Elaine, do you have
some free time tomorrow afternoon?

123
00:07:07,356 --> 00:07:09,108
-Me?
-Yeah, because you're perfect.

124
00:07:09,276 --> 00:07:11,392
You're a calculating,
cold-hearted business woman.

125
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:14,946
When there's dirty work to be done,
you don't mind stomping on throats.

126
00:07:15,116 --> 00:07:17,550
Oh, come on.

127
00:07:19,396 --> 00:07:22,433
Situation number four:
You're breathing on your own...

128
00:07:22,596 --> 00:07:25,633
...you're conscious,
but with no muscular function.

129
00:07:26,076 --> 00:07:27,873
Well, would l be able to
communicate?

130
00:07:28,036 --> 00:07:29,867
l don't see how.

131
00:07:31,876 --> 00:07:33,514
l don't like the sound of this one.

132
00:07:33,676 --> 00:07:35,826
Yeah, let's pull the cord, huh?

133
00:07:35,996 --> 00:07:39,591
Yank it like you're starting a mower.

134
00:07:40,756 --> 00:07:42,792
Moving on.

135
00:07:43,476 --> 00:07:45,944
You have liver, kidneys
and gallbladder...

136
00:07:46,116 --> 00:07:48,186
...but no central nervous system.

137
00:07:52,316 --> 00:07:54,910
Well, l gotta have
a central nervous system.

138
00:07:55,116 --> 00:08:00,349
Okay. One lung, blind,
and you're eating through a tube.

139
00:08:01,156 --> 00:08:03,192
No, that's not my style.

140
00:08:03,356 --> 00:08:05,631
Boring.

141
00:08:06,116 --> 00:08:09,950
All right. You can eat,
but machines do everything else.

142
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,748
l'd stick.

143
00:08:15,716 --> 00:08:19,231
Yeah, yeah, stick, because
l could still go to the coffee shop.

144
00:08:19,396 --> 00:08:20,829
That's right.

145
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,192
-Hello, Milos.
-Jerry.

146
00:08:25,356 --> 00:08:26,675
Thank God you got my message.

147
00:08:26,836 --> 00:08:29,714
Thank you so much
for coming down here. Listen--

148
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:31,389
You know, l spent $200 on a racket.

149
00:08:31,556 --> 00:08:33,672
l thought you knew
what you were talking about.

150
00:08:33,836 --> 00:08:35,269
You can't even play.

151
00:08:35,436 --> 00:08:37,472
Believe me,
it is Milos' great shame...

152
00:08:37,636 --> 00:08:41,788
...but, Jerry, l could lose my business
if anybody find out.

153
00:08:41,956 --> 00:08:45,312
How would you like extra year
membership on the club?

154
00:08:45,476 --> 00:08:48,149
-Free, no charge.
-You could do that?

155
00:08:48,756 --> 00:08:50,587
Jerry, for you, anything.

156
00:08:57,636 --> 00:08:59,706
Game, set and match, huh, Milos?

157
00:09:01,716 --> 00:09:03,195
Jerry, l'm so sorry.

158
00:09:03,356 --> 00:09:06,314
They tell me there is no way
they can do it.

159
00:09:06,476 --> 00:09:09,946
ls there anything else l could
do for you? Anything at all?

160
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:11,344
l refund your money.

161
00:09:11,516 --> 00:09:13,313
Milos, l don't even care
about the money.

162
00:09:13,476 --> 00:09:16,036
l just feel like l was taken
by the worst tennis player--

163
00:09:18,436 --> 00:09:20,028
l make it up to you.

164
00:09:20,196 --> 00:09:21,470
Yeah, you make it up to me.

165
00:09:23,756 --> 00:09:25,109
Tennis, anyone?

166
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:32,275
Oh, this is the one
Vincent told me about.

167
00:09:32,836 --> 00:09:35,145
The Pain and the Yearning.

168
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:40,069
''An old woman experiences
pain and yearning.''

169
00:09:41,156 --> 00:09:43,750
A hundred and ninety-two minutes?

170
00:09:44,396 --> 00:09:46,307
That's a lot of yearning, huh?

171
00:09:47,116 --> 00:09:48,629
You know, these movies are great...

172
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:51,594
...but they are just
so emotionally exhausting.

173
00:09:51,796 --> 00:09:54,708
Well, what you need is some
summertime adolescent high jinks.

174
00:09:54,876 --> 00:09:58,915
-Really?
-Let's see what Dr. Gene prescribes.

175
00:09:59,076 --> 00:10:03,786
Oh, here. Week end at Bernie's II.
Now, that's an hilarious premise.

176
00:10:04,996 --> 00:10:06,111
-Well--
-Yeah, get it.

177
00:10:06,276 --> 00:10:07,789
-Yeah, l could use a chuckle.
-Yeah.

178
00:10:09,356 --> 00:10:10,630
-What are you getting?
-Nothing.

179
00:10:10,796 --> 00:10:13,105
l'm gonna finish watching
The Other Side of Darkness.

180
00:10:13,276 --> 00:10:14,868
-How much you got left?
-About two hours.

181
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,994
Yeah, she shot in that coma
pretty quick.

182
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:24,794
Bernie is dead, you morons.

183
00:10:24,956 --> 00:10:28,505
Just because he's wearing
sunglasses, he looks alive?

184
00:10:28,676 --> 00:10:31,474
How long is this weekend, anyway?

185
00:10:34,796 --> 00:10:38,186
-Hello?
-How's the movie, Elaine?

186
00:10:39,116 --> 00:10:41,835
-Vincent?
-A Gene pick.

187
00:10:41,996 --> 00:10:45,830
How could you?
I thought we had something special.

188
00:10:45,996 --> 00:10:48,510
No, it doesn't mean anything.

189
00:10:48,676 --> 00:10:51,554
l'm not even gonna rewind it.

190
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,474
Vincent?

191
00:10:54,956 --> 00:10:57,186
All right. Let's get to it.

192
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:58,994
Wait a minute.
What about Reilly?

193
00:10:59,156 --> 00:11:01,465
Reilly doesn't work here anymore.

194
00:11:01,636 --> 00:11:04,389
What? l didn't hear about that.

195
00:11:04,556 --> 00:11:07,195
We only wake you up
for the important meetings.

196
00:11:12,396 --> 00:11:15,513
-Hello.
-Hello.

197
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:17,587
Didn't l see you at
the pro shop yesterday?

198
00:11:17,756 --> 00:11:20,987
l think so. l'm Patty.
Milos gave me your address.

199
00:11:21,156 --> 00:11:23,067
l hope you don't mind me
waiting for you here.

200
00:11:23,476 --> 00:11:25,626
Oh, that Milos.

201
00:11:25,796 --> 00:11:29,266
Well, what should we do?
Care for a cup of coffee?

202
00:11:29,436 --> 00:11:31,711
Why don't we just go up to
your apartment?

203
00:11:32,796 --> 00:11:34,593
All right.

204
00:11:38,076 --> 00:11:40,431
Gotta be an easier way.

205
00:11:40,596 --> 00:11:42,109
Doctor, how's her coma?

206
00:11:42,276 --> 00:11:43,948
Oh, exactly the same.

207
00:11:44,116 --> 00:11:45,231
Wait a minute.

208
00:11:45,396 --> 00:11:47,512
She's coming out of the coma.

209
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:52,913
Mrs. Albright, can you hear me?
Are you okay?

210
00:11:53,076 --> 00:11:56,352
I feel so rested and refreshed.

211
00:11:57,076 --> 00:11:59,271
Get me a toothbrush.

212
00:12:01,076 --> 00:12:02,953
So you play tennis?

213
00:12:04,076 --> 00:12:05,555
Enough talk, Jerry.

214
00:12:05,716 --> 00:12:07,069
Not for me. l love chatting.

215
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:11,068
No, no, l can't do this.

216
00:12:11,236 --> 00:12:13,796
l can't go through with this,
not even for him.

217
00:12:13,956 --> 00:12:18,871
-Who?
-Milos, my husband.

218
00:12:19,036 --> 00:12:20,355
Your husband?

219
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:34,349
And so concerned was he that word of
his poor tennis skills might leak out...

220
00:12:34,516 --> 00:12:40,591
...he chose to offer you his wife as
some sort of medieval sexual payola.

221
00:12:41,396 --> 00:12:43,193
He's new around here.

222
00:12:44,276 --> 00:12:46,153
So details.

223
00:12:46,316 --> 00:12:48,830
Well, l didn't sleep with her.

224
00:12:49,196 --> 00:12:51,630
Because of society, right?

225
00:12:51,796 --> 00:12:54,708
Yes, George, because of society.

226
00:12:55,156 --> 00:12:56,908
So how did the big meeting
turn out?

227
00:12:57,676 --> 00:13:00,509
Reilly is no longer with the club.
Can you believe that?

228
00:13:00,676 --> 00:13:02,553
You're better off.
Now you can just let it go.

229
00:13:02,716 --> 00:13:04,069
Yeah, yeah, l'm gonna let it go.

230
00:13:04,236 --> 00:13:06,147
You never had
the right comeback, anyway.

231
00:13:06,836 --> 00:13:08,269
Are you insane?

232
00:13:08,436 --> 00:13:10,825
''Jerk store'' would have
smoked that guy.

233
00:13:11,396 --> 00:13:13,591
Smoked him, l say.

234
00:13:15,276 --> 00:13:16,595
Oh, Jerry, listen.

235
00:13:17,156 --> 00:13:19,750
l saw the rest of that movie,
The Other Side of Darkness.

236
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,872
The coma lady wakes up at the end.

237
00:13:22,276 --> 00:13:26,588
Oh, l wanted to see that.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

238
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:31,990
l didn't know it was possible
to come out of a coma.

239
00:13:32,156 --> 00:13:34,511
l didn't know it was possible
not to know that.

240
00:13:34,676 --> 00:13:36,792
How was Eric Roberts
as the husband?

241
00:13:36,956 --> 00:13:38,514
Oh, unforgettable.

242
00:13:38,676 --> 00:13:42,589
l gotta find Elaine.
You know, she's gonna pull my plug.

243
00:13:48,396 --> 00:13:50,910
What? ''Betrayed''?

244
00:13:51,356 --> 00:13:53,074
Oh, Vincent, l'm so sorry.

245
00:13:53,236 --> 00:13:56,308
Hey, hey, listen, Elaine, l changed
my mind about the whole coma thing.

246
00:13:56,476 --> 00:13:57,875
Yeah, l decided l'm up for it.

247
00:13:58,036 --> 00:14:00,596
Kramer, do you have any idea
what you've done?

248
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,553
Excuse me.

249
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:05,594
What are you doing?

250
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:10,066
Vincent stopped making picks.

251
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:12,707
Well, how am l gonna know
what movies to see?

252
00:14:12,876 --> 00:14:15,106
We have a wide variety
of Gene picks.

253
00:14:15,276 --> 00:14:16,914
Gene's trash.

254
00:14:17,076 --> 00:14:18,748
l'm Gene.

255
00:14:22,716 --> 00:14:24,069
Hi.

256
00:14:25,796 --> 00:14:28,515
Milos, l can assure you,
l had no intention of telling anyone...

257
00:14:28,676 --> 00:14:31,190
...about your unbelievably bad
tennis playing.

258
00:14:31,356 --> 00:14:37,272
Thank you, but unfortunately,
l have much larger problems to fry.

259
00:14:37,756 --> 00:14:41,795
My wife, she has no respect
for Milos anymore.

260
00:14:42,156 --> 00:14:45,353
l guess that's a risk you run
when you dabble in the flesh trade.

261
00:14:45,836 --> 00:14:49,590
Patty, she-- She loves tennis
as much like l do.

262
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:55,114
Would you--? Will you let me
beat you in tennis?

263
00:14:55,276 --> 00:14:59,155
That is the only way l can show her
that l'm still a man.

264
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:01,511
l'll do it as long as
there's no other girls around.

265
00:15:01,676 --> 00:15:04,144
l mean, l wanna be a man too.

266
00:15:05,476 --> 00:15:06,989
So you hurt Vincent's feelings?

267
00:15:07,716 --> 00:15:09,388
Look what came in the mail today.

268
00:15:09,556 --> 00:15:11,228
What's this?

269
00:15:11,556 --> 00:15:15,105
lt's the play button off his VCR.

270
00:15:17,196 --> 00:15:20,347
Boy, look how far back it goes.
lt's like a tooth.

271
00:15:21,636 --> 00:15:24,708
So guess where
Mr. Ocean Phone turned up.

272
00:15:24,876 --> 00:15:27,185
He's working for Firestone
in Akron, Ohio.

273
00:15:27,356 --> 00:15:28,755
-Ohio?
-Yup.

274
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:31,384
l'm leaving first thing
tomorrow morning.

275
00:15:32,036 --> 00:15:34,675
You're flying to Akron
just to zing a guy?

276
00:15:35,276 --> 00:15:37,312
Don't you understand?
lt's not about him.

277
00:15:37,476 --> 00:15:40,832
To have a line as perfect as
''jerk store'' and to never use it.

278
00:15:40,996 --> 00:15:42,429
l couldn't live with myself.

279
00:15:42,596 --> 00:15:46,145
See, there are no jerk stores.

280
00:15:46,636 --> 00:15:49,196
lt's just a little confusing, is all.

281
00:15:49,356 --> 00:15:53,554
lt's smart. lt's a smart line,
and a smart crowd will appreciate it.

282
00:15:53,716 --> 00:15:57,265
And l'm not gonna dumb it down
for some bonehead mass audience.

283
00:15:58,996 --> 00:16:01,112
Not you.

284
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:06,191
Oh, these brittle bones.

285
00:16:06,356 --> 00:16:09,746
How I long to be rid of the pain.

286
00:16:12,956 --> 00:16:16,631
-Hello.
-Elaine, it's Vincent.

287
00:16:16,796 --> 00:16:20,755
Vincent. Where are you?
l have to meet you.

288
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:23,794
No, I can't bear to have
anyone see me.

289
00:16:23,956 --> 00:16:28,825
Vincent, listen, l won't judge you
the way everyone else does.

290
00:16:28,996 --> 00:16:34,514
You're strange and beautiful
and sensitive.

291
00:16:35,196 --> 00:16:37,869
-Now, let's have a look at you.
-All right.

292
00:16:38,036 --> 00:16:41,073
But can you bring me a few things
from the store?

293
00:16:41,236 --> 00:16:43,545
I haven't been out in a while.

294
00:16:48,756 --> 00:16:51,065
Well, go around,
you bunch of crazies.

295
00:16:51,236 --> 00:16:53,704
Maniacs are gonna get us all killed.

296
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:56,065
Hi, can l help you?

297
00:16:56,236 --> 00:16:58,306
Oh, yeah, yeah, l'm Cosmo Kramer.

298
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:00,592
Yeah, l had an appointment
to annul my living will.

299
00:17:00,756 --> 00:17:04,749
Oh, Mr. Kramer, you had
a 1 0:30 appointment. lt's 2:00.

300
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:07,749
Mr. Shellbach had a tennis lesson.
He's gone for the day.

301
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:26,229
-Too good.
-Another game for Milos!

302
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:29,269
You're on fire today.

303
00:17:29,436 --> 00:17:32,269
Hey, Patty, look at this guy.
He's awful.

304
00:17:33,596 --> 00:17:35,234
He's not a man, this Jerry.

305
00:17:35,396 --> 00:17:37,307
He's not even married like l am.

306
00:17:37,716 --> 00:17:40,184
Hey, Milos, l don't mind
rolling over here...

307
00:17:40,356 --> 00:17:43,234
...but could you lighten up
on the '' not a man'' stuff?

308
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:48,186
Hey, everybody, look. The little
chicken girl wants me to ease up.

309
00:17:48,356 --> 00:17:52,349
He can't handle this.
He cries like a woman.

310
00:18:05,756 --> 00:18:07,792
Hello? Vincent?

311
00:18:08,436 --> 00:18:10,074
Elaine?

312
00:18:10,236 --> 00:18:12,670
l got what you asked.

313
00:18:12,836 --> 00:18:14,747
Just leave it and go.

314
00:18:14,996 --> 00:18:16,827
Well, can l come in?

315
00:18:16,996 --> 00:18:18,907
No, go away, now.

316
00:18:19,236 --> 00:18:23,832
No, no, Vincent, l....
Oh, don't shut me out.

317
00:18:23,996 --> 00:18:27,625
l just-- l know you feel what l feel.

318
00:18:27,796 --> 00:18:30,629
-Excuse me, can l help you?
-Oh, damn it.

319
00:18:31,316 --> 00:18:34,035
-l'm here to see Vincent.
-Well, l'm his mother.

320
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:37,393
-Vincent, what's going on here?
-No, my acne!

321
00:18:38,876 --> 00:18:40,673
Acne?

322
00:18:40,836 --> 00:18:42,713
What do you have here?

323
00:18:42,876 --> 00:18:46,710
Vodka, cigarettes, fireworks.

324
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:50,551
What kind of a sick woman
brings this to a 1 5-year-old?

325
00:18:50,716 --> 00:18:54,470
We have the same taste in movies.

326
00:18:54,636 --> 00:18:56,547
Did he send you part of our VCR?

327
00:19:07,516 --> 00:19:09,552
Vincent?

328
00:19:19,596 --> 00:19:22,110
Look at the big baby.

329
00:19:22,276 --> 00:19:25,268
Hey, big baby,
are you wetting yourself?

330
00:19:25,436 --> 00:19:28,109
Maybe it is time for you
to be changed.

331
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:32,191
l told you to cut it out.

332
00:19:35,316 --> 00:19:36,908
Come on, what are you doing?

333
00:19:37,796 --> 00:19:40,264
The baby got lucky on that one.

334
00:19:47,636 --> 00:19:49,149
Shellbach. Hey.

335
00:20:02,356 --> 00:20:03,994
Racket?

336
00:20:20,836 --> 00:20:25,956
So, George, you're proposing
a Snow Tire Day at Yankee Stadium?

337
00:20:26,316 --> 00:20:28,307
As long as they don't
throw them on the field.

338
00:20:28,476 --> 00:20:31,115
Help yourself to some shrimp.
l brought enough for everybody.

339
00:20:31,276 --> 00:20:33,073
l have to say, this--

340
00:20:33,356 --> 00:20:35,426
This proposal doesn't make
a whole lot of sense.

341
00:20:35,596 --> 00:20:36,790
Well, you never know.

342
00:20:36,956 --> 00:20:39,186
Let's see how many
l can fit in my mouth.

343
00:20:40,756 --> 00:20:42,030
You know, George...

344
00:20:43,396 --> 00:20:46,627
...the ocean called.
They're running out of shrimp.

345
00:20:49,436 --> 00:20:51,188
Oh, yeah, Reilly?

346
00:20:52,796 --> 00:20:56,391
Well, the jerk store called.
They're running out of you.

347
00:20:58,036 --> 00:21:01,824
What's the difference?
You're their all-time bestseller.

348
00:21:09,116 --> 00:21:13,268
Yeah? Well, l had sex
with your wife.

349
00:21:23,796 --> 00:21:25,787
His wife's in a coma.

350
00:21:35,876 --> 00:21:37,707
Hi. How's he doing?

351
00:21:37,876 --> 00:21:39,707
He's been sleeping a lot.
He's still groggy.

352
00:21:40,836 --> 00:21:42,952
l thought a movie
might cheer him up.

353
00:21:43,116 --> 00:21:45,630
-l got him a Gene pick.
-What happened to Vincent?

354
00:21:46,036 --> 00:21:49,187
l'm kind of off of him.

355
00:21:49,356 --> 00:21:51,074
Outlet?

356
00:22:13,956 --> 00:22:15,912
'' My wife's in a coma.''

357
00:22:16,396 --> 00:22:22,312
Yeah? Well, the life-support machine
called and.... Stupid.

358
00:22:24,396 --> 00:22:29,345
Wait. Yes.
That's what l should have said.

359
00:22:34,116 --> 00:22:38,507
You're meat, Reilly!
You just screwed yourself!
