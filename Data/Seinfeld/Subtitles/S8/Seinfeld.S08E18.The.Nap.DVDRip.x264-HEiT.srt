1
00:00:05,302 --> 00:00:08,135
You know that manslaughter
is the least serious murder charge?

2
00:00:08,582 --> 00:00:10,698
-You don't say.
-Manslaughter.

3
00:00:10,862 --> 00:00:12,580
Literally, the slaughter of a man.

4
00:00:12,742 --> 00:00:14,380
-Sounds brutal, doesn't it?
-Heinous.

5
00:00:14,542 --> 00:00:17,898
Yet it's the most socially acceptable
form of murder.

6
00:00:18,222 --> 00:00:20,213
So you think we should
change the name.

7
00:00:20,382 --> 00:00:24,694
Yes, l do. How about
'' inadvertent life-ending''?

8
00:00:25,542 --> 00:00:26,941
'' Unintentional snuff-out.''

9
00:00:27,102 --> 00:00:29,662
How about
'' l can't believe it's not murder''?

10
00:00:34,222 --> 00:00:38,101
Oh, boy, l was up till 4 in the morning
watching that Omen trilogy.

11
00:00:38,302 --> 00:00:40,691
-That's good stuff.
-The devil? Forget about it.

12
00:00:40,862 --> 00:00:42,500
Well, he was the devil's son, right?

13
00:00:42,662 --> 00:00:46,496
-l thought he was the devil's helper.
-He's pretty scary for a helper.

14
00:00:47,782 --> 00:00:50,296
l can't keep doing this to myself.
l'm exhausted.

15
00:00:50,462 --> 00:00:52,100
Can't you grab a nap at work?

16
00:00:52,262 --> 00:00:54,935
Not with that big glass window
looking out onto the hall.

17
00:00:55,102 --> 00:00:56,535
And l love a good nap.

18
00:00:56,702 --> 00:00:59,136
Sometimes it's the only thing
getting me out of bed.

19
00:00:59,302 --> 00:01:00,940
-l'll see you.
-Bye.

20
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:04,060
-What are you doing now?
-Gonna take a stroll through the park.

21
00:01:04,222 --> 00:01:05,575
With a gentleman caller?

22
00:01:05,742 --> 00:01:07,972
Yes, his name is Hal.

23
00:01:08,142 --> 00:01:10,815
Walking date's good.
You don't have to look at the person.

24
00:01:10,982 --> 00:01:12,938
lt's the next best thing
to being alone.

25
00:01:14,102 --> 00:01:15,251
-Hey, hi.
-Hi.

26
00:01:15,422 --> 00:01:17,572
-Shower?
-Oh, pool.

27
00:01:17,942 --> 00:01:19,534
l just swam 200 laps.

28
00:01:19,702 --> 00:01:21,135
You are kidding.

29
00:01:21,502 --> 00:01:24,812
Yeah, look at those babies, huh?
They're prunes.

30
00:01:24,982 --> 00:01:26,893
You know, l saw Conrad
going to your place.

31
00:01:27,062 --> 00:01:30,134
Yeah, that's right. Those new
kitchen cabinets. How's that coming?

32
00:01:30,302 --> 00:01:32,691
Slow. l gotta hold this guy's hand
on every decision.

33
00:01:32,862 --> 00:01:34,853
Kramer, listen.
You've seen The Omen, right?

34
00:01:35,022 --> 00:01:37,138
What exactly was that kid?

35
00:01:37,302 --> 00:01:38,781
Oh, Damien?

36
00:01:38,942 --> 00:01:43,174
Nothing, just a mischievous,
rambunctious kid.

37
00:01:45,502 --> 00:01:49,131
George, have you seen
that American League directory?

38
00:01:49,302 --> 00:01:51,338
lt's a big green book.

39
00:01:52,542 --> 00:01:55,614
-Right here.
-Thanks, kiddo.

40
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,418
You know Twinkies aren't cooked?

41
00:02:11,582 --> 00:02:13,493
lt looks cooked.
lt's dark on the bottom.

42
00:02:13,662 --> 00:02:15,732
That's just the way it is.
lt's a substance.

43
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:17,779
Well, l don't care. They're delicious.

44
00:02:17,942 --> 00:02:20,581
-You wanna sit down?
-Oh, l don't sit on park benches.

45
00:02:20,742 --> 00:02:22,698
-They're very bad for the back.
-Really?

46
00:02:22,862 --> 00:02:25,774
l threw my back out 1 5 years ago.
Ever since, l've been careful.

47
00:02:25,942 --> 00:02:27,739
l buy my furniture
at an ergonomic store.

48
00:02:27,902 --> 00:02:31,099
Oh, those places
have the stupidest names.

49
00:02:31,262 --> 00:02:33,332
Like-- Like Back in Business...

50
00:02:33,502 --> 00:02:35,970
...or Good Vertebrations.

51
00:02:36,142 --> 00:02:38,736
Not this one.
lt's called the Lumbar Yard.

52
00:02:43,582 --> 00:02:46,176
Hey, Jerry.
Jerry, are you okay with this hinge?

53
00:02:46,342 --> 00:02:48,139
-Yeah.
-l can get you any kind you want.

54
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:50,452
Four holes, two holes,
bronze, no hinge at all.

55
00:02:50,622 --> 00:02:53,216
You know, why don't we just go
with the one in your hand?

56
00:02:53,742 --> 00:02:55,733
-Well, these are different.
-Drop one.

57
00:02:56,622 --> 00:02:58,533
Left.

58
00:03:01,622 --> 00:03:04,773
Jerry, look at my eyes.

59
00:03:04,942 --> 00:03:07,137
A little less beady today.

60
00:03:07,302 --> 00:03:09,179
Because l'm refreshed.

61
00:03:09,342 --> 00:03:12,095
l finally found a way
to sleep in my office.

62
00:03:12,262 --> 00:03:13,695
Under the desk, huh?

63
00:03:13,862 --> 00:03:16,501
l lie on my back, l tuck in the chair,
l'm invisible.

64
00:03:16,662 --> 00:03:17,936
Sounds like a cool fort.

65
00:03:18,702 --> 00:03:21,136
Hey, Jerry, do you want
a flat edge on this molding...

66
00:03:21,302 --> 00:03:22,815
...or do you want me to bevel it?

67
00:03:22,982 --> 00:03:26,099
-l'll tell you what l'd like to do with it.
-Hey, Conrad, is it?

68
00:03:26,262 --> 00:03:28,696
Conrad, Connie or Con.
Whatever you prefer.

69
00:03:29,222 --> 00:03:30,416
Let me ask you a question.

70
00:03:30,582 --> 00:03:33,460
Could you expand
the space underneath a desk...

71
00:03:33,622 --> 00:03:35,613
...you know, give it
a little more headroom?

72
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:37,659
George, he's kind of tied up here.

73
00:03:37,822 --> 00:03:39,540
What? lt would have to be
a night job.

74
00:03:39,702 --> 00:03:42,091
-You normally work after dinner?
-There is no normal.

75
00:03:42,262 --> 00:03:45,572
Whatever Jerry wants. He wants me
here late, l'm late. Early, l'm early.

76
00:03:45,742 --> 00:03:48,620
Why don't you just work
on George's project for a while.

77
00:03:48,782 --> 00:03:50,295
Whatever you want.

78
00:03:52,022 --> 00:03:53,978
So how was Wednesday
in the park with Hal?

79
00:03:54,622 --> 00:03:57,659
lt was okay. He's coming over later
to watch a movie.

80
00:03:57,822 --> 00:04:00,211
Hey, listen,
what's better for your back:

81
00:04:00,382 --> 00:04:03,692
The couch cushions
or a folding chair?

82
00:04:03,862 --> 00:04:05,454
l don't know.

83
00:04:06,462 --> 00:04:09,340
Maybe we'll just stand
and watch the TV.

84
00:04:11,022 --> 00:04:12,614
l gotta go. Somebody's at my door.

85
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,811
-Yeah?
-Delivery.

86
00:04:18,822 --> 00:04:20,096
-Elaine Benes?
-Yeah.

87
00:04:20,262 --> 00:04:22,173
We're from Lumbar Yard.
Got your mattress.

88
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:25,330
Mattress?
l didn't order a mattress.

89
00:04:25,502 --> 00:04:27,254
Who sent this?

90
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,457
'' Hal Kitzmiller''?

91
00:04:34,062 --> 00:04:39,341
You think it might be possible to add
a little shelf, like, for an alarm clock?

92
00:04:39,502 --> 00:04:41,015
What, about maybe that big?

93
00:04:41,182 --> 00:04:42,854
-l don't know, like this?
-Like that?

94
00:04:43,022 --> 00:04:44,216
-Like that.
-l can do that.

95
00:04:44,382 --> 00:04:45,735
Great.

96
00:04:46,622 --> 00:04:49,136
You know, this could sound crazy...

97
00:04:49,342 --> 00:04:52,891
...but what do you think about adding
a drawer for, like, a blanket?

98
00:04:53,182 --> 00:04:54,934
-Blanket or a quilt?
-Blanket.

99
00:04:55,102 --> 00:04:56,694
-About that thick?
-Maybe like this.

100
00:04:56,862 --> 00:04:57,897
-Like that?
-Like that.

101
00:04:58,062 --> 00:05:00,417
-lf that's what you want.
-That's what l want.

102
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:03,413
Hey, George, do you want
this cup holder--?

103
00:05:03,582 --> 00:05:05,891
Want it mounted on the left,
the right, the middle?

104
00:05:06,062 --> 00:05:07,734
Whatever.

105
00:05:15,542 --> 00:05:17,260
This is unbelievable.

106
00:05:17,422 --> 00:05:19,219
This is better than my bed at home.

107
00:05:19,382 --> 00:05:21,293
All right. lt's been a long night.

108
00:05:21,462 --> 00:05:22,895
You go home and get some sleep.

109
00:05:23,062 --> 00:05:25,576
-lf that's what you want.
-That's what l want.

110
00:05:30,782 --> 00:05:33,854
-Morning, George.
-Morning, Mr. Wilhelm.

111
00:05:42,302 --> 00:05:44,532
-l got pool problems, Jerry.
-What happened?

112
00:05:44,702 --> 00:05:46,693
Well, l had been swimming
for three hours...

113
00:05:46,862 --> 00:05:50,138
...and l was in a real groove,
so l decided to keep going.

114
00:05:50,302 --> 00:05:52,418
But at 1 0, they start the aquacise.

115
00:05:52,582 --> 00:05:55,415
Thirty-five geriatrics
throwing elbows.

116
00:05:55,582 --> 00:05:59,814
lt was like l was swimming through
a flabby-armed spanking machine.

117
00:05:59,982 --> 00:06:03,418
-Well, how long did that last?
-Half-hour. Then diving class started.

118
00:06:03,582 --> 00:06:05,732
Well, that got a little messy.

119
00:06:06,862 --> 00:06:08,853
l gotta find a new place to swim...

120
00:06:09,022 --> 00:06:11,013
...because that pool
can't hold me, Jerry.

121
00:06:11,742 --> 00:06:13,812
-How was the movie?
-l cancelled.

122
00:06:13,982 --> 00:06:17,099
Hal sent a mattress
to my apartment.

123
00:06:17,262 --> 00:06:19,378
-The nerve of that guy.
-Why?

124
00:06:19,542 --> 00:06:21,260
He's got a back problem.

125
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:23,982
You think he was expecting
a roll in the supportive hay?

126
00:06:24,462 --> 00:06:26,054
After one date.

127
00:06:26,222 --> 00:06:29,055
-What's that guy's last name again?
-Kitzmiller.

128
00:06:29,382 --> 00:06:31,054
Oh, that's right.

129
00:06:32,262 --> 00:06:33,980
What are you gonna do
with the mattress?

130
00:06:34,142 --> 00:06:35,336
l don't know, chuck it?

131
00:06:35,502 --> 00:06:37,094
Oh, wait, no, no, no. l'll take it.

132
00:06:37,262 --> 00:06:39,457
Yeah, come over.
See if it'll fit in my bedroom.

133
00:06:39,622 --> 00:06:41,897
-Oh, all right.
-Yeah, my old one sprung a leak.

134
00:06:42,062 --> 00:06:43,734
-You have a waterbed?
-Sand.

135
00:06:43,902 --> 00:06:45,494
lt's like sleeping on a beach.

136
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:47,976
-Hey.
-Hi, Con.

137
00:06:48,142 --> 00:06:49,621
Jerry, l'm sorry l'm late.

138
00:06:49,782 --> 00:06:51,898
George and l,
we've been up all night long.

139
00:06:52,062 --> 00:06:54,292
l can make up the time to you
any number of ways.

140
00:06:54,462 --> 00:06:57,420
How about this?
Finish this thing up today.

141
00:06:57,582 --> 00:07:00,574
-Couple questions for you.
-No, no more questions.

142
00:07:00,742 --> 00:07:03,700
Just figure it out for yourself
and get it done.

143
00:07:03,862 --> 00:07:07,491
All right, Jerry, but l can figure it out
by myself any way you want.

144
00:07:07,662 --> 00:07:10,779
Just do it.

145
00:07:14,262 --> 00:07:17,060
Costanza. Where's Costanza?

146
00:07:18,302 --> 00:07:19,371
Have you seen Costanza?

147
00:07:19,542 --> 00:07:20,736
l've seen him around.

148
00:07:20,902 --> 00:07:24,292
He was humming this song yesterday.
l can't seem to get it out of my head.

149
00:07:24,462 --> 00:07:25,895
l gotta know the name of that.

150
00:07:26,062 --> 00:07:28,576
She's a heartbreak er
A love-tak er

151
00:07:28,742 --> 00:07:31,381
Brubak er run this prison lik e a man

152
00:07:31,542 --> 00:07:33,976
Something like that.
Very catchy tune. Very, very catchy.

153
00:07:34,142 --> 00:07:36,815
Well, you know what? l'm gonna
sit here and wait for that guy.

154
00:07:36,982 --> 00:07:38,654
What is this, People?

155
00:07:39,222 --> 00:07:41,577
''The Most Beautiful People''
People.

156
00:07:41,742 --> 00:07:44,973
Connie Sellecca.
Nothing wrong that, huh?

157
00:07:49,182 --> 00:07:51,093
Elaine, you're taking this
the wrong way.

158
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,456
That's not what l intended.

159
00:07:52,622 --> 00:07:54,772
Well, what did you intend, Hal?

160
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:57,615
l just wanted you to have the comfort
and support you deserve.

161
00:07:57,782 --> 00:08:00,296
That's why l had the mattress
custom designed for you.

162
00:08:00,462 --> 00:08:01,895
Custom designed?

163
00:08:02,062 --> 00:08:05,213
They adjust the foam density and
the spring tension to your body type.

164
00:08:05,382 --> 00:08:08,101
l estimated your height and weight:
5'8'', about 1 1 0 pounds?

165
00:08:10,302 --> 00:08:14,693
Oh, that is the nicest thing
anyone has ever done for me.

166
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:17,422
-So you do like the mattress?
-l love it.

167
00:08:17,582 --> 00:08:21,621
l'm glad l kept it.

168
00:08:23,942 --> 00:08:25,773
Over there, that's Brooklyn.

169
00:08:25,942 --> 00:08:27,295
That's where Spike Lee lives.

170
00:08:29,982 --> 00:08:33,372
Hey, there's a man
swimming in the water.

171
00:08:36,142 --> 00:08:38,702
No, that's probably
just a dead body, son.

172
00:08:38,862 --> 00:08:41,899
You see, when the mob kills someone,
they throw the body in the river.

173
00:08:46,022 --> 00:08:47,250
Hey, Jerr.

174
00:08:47,862 --> 00:08:49,056
-Hey, buddy.
-Hey.

175
00:08:49,222 --> 00:08:51,133
Well, my swimming pool
problems are solved.

176
00:08:51,302 --> 00:08:53,975
l just found myself
miles and miles of open lanes.

177
00:08:54,142 --> 00:08:57,100
-What is that smell?
-That's East River.

178
00:08:57,982 --> 00:08:59,813
-You're swimming in the East River?
-Yeah.

179
00:08:59,982 --> 00:09:01,256
The most heavily-trafficked...

180
00:09:01,422 --> 00:09:03,936
...overly-contaminated waterway
on the Eastern Seaboard?

181
00:09:04,102 --> 00:09:06,821
Technically, Norfolk
has more gross tonnage.

182
00:09:07,782 --> 00:09:09,579
How could you swim in that water?

183
00:09:09,742 --> 00:09:11,573
l saw a couple of other guys
out there.

184
00:09:11,742 --> 00:09:13,539
-Swimming?
-Well, floating.

185
00:09:13,702 --> 00:09:16,580
They weren't moving much,
but they were out there.

186
00:09:37,462 --> 00:09:38,690
Hey, Kramer. It's Elaine.

187
00:09:38,862 --> 00:09:40,500
Thanks for bringing
my mattress back...

188
00:09:40,662 --> 00:09:43,779
...and l guess l'll just get
my spare key from you whenever.

189
00:09:43,942 --> 00:09:45,739
All right. Bye.

190
00:09:49,262 --> 00:09:51,492
Oh, this is a good mattress.

191
00:09:59,462 --> 00:10:02,295
Where is this guy? l've been waiting
for three and a half hours.

192
00:10:02,462 --> 00:10:05,022
Should l go? No way, Jack.

193
00:10:05,502 --> 00:10:07,538
l'm not humming it
at the record store again.

194
00:10:07,702 --> 00:10:09,977
-Mr. Steinbrenner?
-That's what they call me.

195
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:13,134
-Your grandchildren are here.
-Oh, well, send them in.

196
00:10:13,302 --> 00:10:15,497
-Send the tykes in.
-Grandpa, Grandpa, Grandpa.

197
00:10:15,662 --> 00:10:17,175
Hey, you little kids.

198
00:10:17,342 --> 00:10:19,731
Who are you people?
Come here. Come here.

199
00:10:19,902 --> 00:10:22,370
How about a ride on
the Stein-pony express? Get up here.

200
00:10:22,542 --> 00:10:24,851
What's your name, shorty?
Mel? Are you Mel?

201
00:10:27,982 --> 00:10:29,859
-Hello.
-Jerry, Jerry.

202
00:10:30,022 --> 00:10:32,331
l'm trapped under my desk.
Steinbrenner's in the room.

203
00:10:32,502 --> 00:10:34,857
-You gotta help me.
-Who is this?

204
00:10:35,022 --> 00:10:37,331
-Jerry.
-Hi.

205
00:10:37,502 --> 00:10:40,300
Go away. Bye-bye. Get away.

206
00:10:40,462 --> 00:10:44,899
-Hi, l'm Brian.
-Beat it, Brian. Beat it. Beat it.

207
00:10:45,382 --> 00:10:47,020
Why don't you
just have him paged?

208
00:10:47,182 --> 00:10:49,332
They'll see the extension's
coming from my--

209
00:10:49,502 --> 00:10:52,380
Back off. Come on.

210
00:10:54,182 --> 00:10:55,376
Would you do something?

211
00:10:55,542 --> 00:10:56,861
Call in a bomb threat.

212
00:10:57,022 --> 00:10:59,297
A bomb threat? Why would l
call in a bomb threat?

213
00:10:59,462 --> 00:11:01,180
Just call.

214
00:11:01,342 --> 00:11:04,857
-l think l should have some reason.
-Jerry!

215
00:11:07,062 --> 00:11:09,940
You kids are up on all the new tunes.
Tell me if this rings a bell:

216
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:12,411
Heartbreak er
Love-tak er

217
00:11:12,582 --> 00:11:15,142
Shoemak er
Won't you fix my shoes for free?

218
00:11:15,302 --> 00:11:17,020
Anything? Shorty? Girl?

219
00:11:17,182 --> 00:11:20,299
Mr. Steinbrenner, we received a call.
There's a bomb in the building.

220
00:11:20,462 --> 00:11:21,975
-Thank God.
-A bomb in the building?

221
00:11:22,142 --> 00:11:25,100
Oh, my God. Quick,
everybody under the desk.

222
00:11:28,662 --> 00:11:30,539
Can you imagine
what went through my mind...

223
00:11:30,702 --> 00:11:32,852
...when l saw there wasn't room
under that desk...

224
00:11:33,022 --> 00:11:34,375
...for me and my babies?

225
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,620
-l'm sorry, sir.
-You know what l think?

226
00:11:37,102 --> 00:11:39,616
-l think you knew about that bomb.
-What?

227
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,374
You had a premonition
about the bomb.

228
00:11:41,542 --> 00:11:43,180
You climbed under
because you have ESP.

229
00:11:43,342 --> 00:11:45,697
Quick, George,
put a thought in my mind.

230
00:11:46,542 --> 00:11:49,420
Meatballs, huh? Unbelievable.
You're a wonder, George.

231
00:11:51,182 --> 00:11:55,255
Anyway, this terrorist
had a very specific demand.

232
00:11:55,422 --> 00:11:57,492
No more cheap adjustable hats
for Hat Day.

233
00:11:57,662 --> 00:12:00,051
He wants fitted hats
just like the players wear.

234
00:12:03,382 --> 00:12:05,850
-Jerry. Jerry.
-Yeah.

235
00:12:08,022 --> 00:12:09,614
What the hell is this?

236
00:12:09,782 --> 00:12:11,977
-Where are you?
-Over here.

237
00:12:12,142 --> 00:12:13,655
You can see right through here.

238
00:12:14,782 --> 00:12:17,933
What is this? lt's like you're selling
movie tickets back here.

239
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:19,854
l think it's kind of cozy.

240
00:12:20,542 --> 00:12:24,217
All right. You are not gonna believe
what Kramer did to my mattress.

241
00:12:24,382 --> 00:12:27,055
l can't-- l can't talk to you like this.

242
00:12:29,502 --> 00:12:33,097
So Kramer completely
funked up my mattress.

243
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:35,054
Does it smell like the East River?

244
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:38,055
Yes, it does. How did you know?

245
00:12:38,222 --> 00:12:40,782
Kramer's been swimming laps
between the Queensboro Bridge...

246
00:12:40,942 --> 00:12:44,059
-...and the Brooklyn Bridge.
-Oh, great!

247
00:12:47,822 --> 00:12:51,019
Oh, man,
l'm on the wrong floor again.

248
00:12:52,782 --> 00:12:54,181
Hey.

249
00:12:54,342 --> 00:12:56,981
Thanks for ruining my mattress.
lt reeks.

250
00:12:57,142 --> 00:12:59,975
Hey, you know what l think it is?
l think it's that East River.

251
00:13:00,542 --> 00:13:02,260
l think it might be polluted.

252
00:13:05,342 --> 00:13:09,096
Well, you really did it to me
this time, Seinfeld.

253
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:15,572
What the hell happened here?

254
00:13:15,742 --> 00:13:17,141
-Hey.
-Hey.

255
00:13:17,502 --> 00:13:20,778
-Look how obtrusive it is.
-lt is obtrusive, isn't it?

256
00:13:20,942 --> 00:13:23,376
-lt's very obtrusive.
-l don't think it's that bad.

257
00:13:23,542 --> 00:13:26,773
-Well, can l get a stool in here?
-No, the stools go over there.

258
00:13:26,942 --> 00:13:29,900
No, no, no, that's no good.
l'm leaving.

259
00:13:30,062 --> 00:13:33,498
Yeah, l'm with stinky.
l'm going back to my place.

260
00:13:37,902 --> 00:13:42,054
Fitted Hat Day? That's what
you asked Steinbrenner for?

261
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:45,100
Hey, they're actually
doing the fitted hats? Cool.

262
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:49,899
Guess who he put in charge
of Fitted Hat Day. Me.

263
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:52,622
-Hey, look at you.
-Yeah, look at me.

264
00:13:52,782 --> 00:13:57,060
Now, l gotta figure out the different
head sizes of 59,000 different people.

265
00:13:57,222 --> 00:13:59,656
What if a pinhead shows up?
l gotta be on top of that.

266
00:13:59,822 --> 00:14:02,336
No knockoffs. l want the ones
like the real players wear.

267
00:14:03,062 --> 00:14:05,371
Forget the fitted hats!
l'm not doing it!

268
00:14:05,542 --> 00:14:08,739
And you're gonna call Steinbrenner
back and cancel the whole thing!

269
00:14:08,902 --> 00:14:12,212
-Could you at least get a hat for me?
-Fine. What size?

270
00:14:12,382 --> 00:14:14,452
-Seven and five-eighths.
-Seven and five-eighths!

271
00:14:14,622 --> 00:14:16,931
-Why are you shouting?
-l don't know! lt's this place.

272
00:14:17,102 --> 00:14:19,457
l'm very uncomfortable here.

273
00:14:21,542 --> 00:14:22,816
So you're liking the mattress?

274
00:14:22,982 --> 00:14:24,495
Oh, l'm loving it.

275
00:14:24,662 --> 00:14:26,414
You know, we should...

276
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:28,970
...get going.

277
00:14:29,742 --> 00:14:32,540
-What is that smell?
-What smell?

278
00:14:34,422 --> 00:14:37,095
l think it's the mattress.
Did something happen to it?

279
00:14:37,262 --> 00:14:41,653
No, no. Oh, you know what that is?

280
00:14:43,022 --> 00:14:47,618
l went clamming the other day
and l forgot to hose off my boots.

281
00:14:47,782 --> 00:14:51,218
-Clamming?
-Yeah, l clam and scallop.

282
00:14:51,382 --> 00:14:52,895
l clam and scallop.

283
00:14:56,622 --> 00:14:58,852
Yes, yes, come in. Come in.

284
00:14:59,022 --> 00:15:01,377
Sir, l just got a call
from the terrorist.

285
00:15:01,542 --> 00:15:03,498
l told him to call here,
if you have a moment.

286
00:15:03,662 --> 00:15:06,654
Costanza, let me ask you something.
ls it '' Fe-bru-ary'' or '' Feb-uary''?

287
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:10,132
Because l prefer '' uary,''
and what is this rule?

288
00:15:10,942 --> 00:15:13,410
Let me put that
on speaker phone for you, sir.

289
00:15:13,982 --> 00:15:16,655
-Hello, bomber?
-Yeah, this is the terrorist bomber.

290
00:15:16,822 --> 00:15:19,097
You know, Costanza
is busting his hump on those hats.

291
00:15:19,262 --> 00:15:22,140
Yeah, you know, about those hats,
l think maybe l changed my mind.

292
00:15:22,302 --> 00:15:24,133
You don't want them?
They're gone. Goodbye.

293
00:15:24,302 --> 00:15:26,532
-Good thinking, sir.
-Now, what do you want instead?

294
00:15:26,702 --> 00:15:28,374
-What?
-Well, you're the terrorist.

295
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:29,895
You gotta want something.

296
00:15:30,302 --> 00:15:32,372
It would be nice
if you called tick et-holders...

297
00:15:32,542 --> 00:15:34,055
... if a game is
gonna be rained out.

298
00:15:34,222 --> 00:15:36,258
All right, George,
you can handle that.

299
00:15:36,542 --> 00:15:37,736
What the hell are you doing?

300
00:15:37,902 --> 00:15:40,575
We have to stand tough. That's why
l had to hang up the phone.

301
00:15:40,742 --> 00:15:42,619
When someone's unstable,
don't stir the pot.

302
00:15:42,782 --> 00:15:45,342
Know what l'll do? Run around
the stadium, closing windows.

303
00:15:45,502 --> 00:15:46,776
That's what l'm doing, pal.

304
00:15:46,982 --> 00:15:50,019
And l'll tell you something else:
l am very nervous!

305
00:15:51,102 --> 00:15:54,697
l liked that stuffed-crust pizza,
cheese-in-crust pizza.

306
00:15:54,862 --> 00:15:57,057
-lt's just more cheese.
-Let me tell you something.

307
00:15:57,222 --> 00:16:00,339
lt'll be years before they find another
place to hide cheese on a pizza.

308
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:01,617
-Kramer.
-Oh, hey.

309
00:16:01,782 --> 00:16:03,693
Hi. Oh, this is Hal.

310
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:05,011
Hal, Kramer. Kramer, Hal.

311
00:16:05,182 --> 00:16:06,820
Hal...

312
00:16:06,982 --> 00:16:07,971
...Langerhans.

313
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,298
-Kitzmiller.
-Yeah, Kitzmiller.

314
00:16:10,462 --> 00:16:12,214
-That's right.
-You taking a dip?

315
00:16:12,382 --> 00:16:15,658
-Oh, l'm dipping.
-That smell?

316
00:16:15,822 --> 00:16:17,414
Well, listen l gotta get to the pier.

317
00:16:17,582 --> 00:16:19,891
Ferry traffic gets really bad
around 4:30, but....

318
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,053
Look, l still got your key
to your apartment...

319
00:16:22,222 --> 00:16:24,782
...and l'll give it back to you
as soon as l can.

320
00:16:25,182 --> 00:16:26,581
Baby.

321
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,580
Lunch.

322
00:17:06,862 --> 00:17:09,660
-Kramer.
-Hey.

323
00:17:10,222 --> 00:17:13,259
-Can l talk to you a minute?
-Yeah, sure, sure.

324
00:17:14,302 --> 00:17:15,815
-Oh, boy.
-Kitzmiller.

325
00:17:16,382 --> 00:17:18,179
That's it.

326
00:17:18,502 --> 00:17:23,018
-You and Elaine are pretty close.
-Oh, we go back a ways.

327
00:17:23,182 --> 00:17:25,013
And you've....

328
00:17:25,182 --> 00:17:26,934
How do l put this?

329
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:30,300
-You've been in her bed.
-That's right.

330
00:17:31,182 --> 00:17:32,456
But this isn't still going on?

331
00:17:32,622 --> 00:17:35,011
No, no, no, she put a stop to that.

332
00:17:36,462 --> 00:17:37,781
That's all l needed to know.

333
00:17:38,622 --> 00:17:40,852
So you actually swim in this thing?

334
00:17:41,022 --> 00:17:44,492
Oh, yeah. Exercises
every muscle in the body.

335
00:17:44,662 --> 00:17:46,095
lt's great for the back.

336
00:17:46,262 --> 00:17:48,332
Great for the back. Right.

337
00:17:48,502 --> 00:17:52,131
Four hours in this chop,
and l'm a full inch taller.

338
00:17:55,222 --> 00:17:57,019
Giddyup.

339
00:17:59,542 --> 00:18:01,772
Heartbreak er
Brubak er

340
00:18:02,102 --> 00:18:04,855
Hey, hey, George,
l remember that tune. George?

341
00:18:05,062 --> 00:18:06,814
George?

342
00:18:06,982 --> 00:18:08,540
What's that ticking?

343
00:18:14,142 --> 00:18:16,576
Fire in the hole!

344
00:18:18,102 --> 00:18:21,651
l can't believe the Lumbar Yard
wouldn't pick this up.

345
00:18:33,502 --> 00:18:34,935
Okay.

346
00:18:40,622 --> 00:18:43,261
-You want it back the way it was?
-Yeah, that's right.

347
00:18:43,582 --> 00:18:45,220
You know, l don't get you, Seinfeld.

348
00:18:45,382 --> 00:18:47,942
You want something one day.
The next day you don't like it.

349
00:18:48,102 --> 00:18:50,093
l mean, come on, man.
Make a decision.

350
00:18:50,942 --> 00:18:52,660
One second.

351
00:18:54,142 --> 00:18:56,178
-Hello.
-Jerry, you gotta help me.

352
00:18:56,342 --> 00:18:57,900
l threw my back out.

353
00:18:58,062 --> 00:18:59,290
So just lie down.

354
00:18:59,462 --> 00:19:02,056
l am lying down.

355
00:19:02,222 --> 00:19:06,773
l am trapped
under a funky mattress.

356
00:19:07,102 --> 00:19:08,979
You gotta go get a doctor...

357
00:19:09,142 --> 00:19:13,738
...or at least come over
and roll this thing off of me.

358
00:19:14,342 --> 00:19:16,333
All right. l'll be right there.

359
00:19:17,342 --> 00:19:19,173
Conrad, l gotta go.

360
00:19:19,342 --> 00:19:21,651
Stay, go. Whatever.

361
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:26,820
-Hey, Kramer.
-What's going on?

362
00:19:26,982 --> 00:19:29,974
l told my chiropractor how swimming
in the river made my back feel.

363
00:19:30,142 --> 00:19:31,860
He recommended it
to all his patients.

364
00:19:34,182 --> 00:19:36,059
Step aside.

365
00:19:40,862 --> 00:19:43,330
He just sunk like a stone, didn't he?

366
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:50,974
-Sir, l'm sure it's not a bomb.
-Don't be so brave, George.

367
00:19:51,142 --> 00:19:53,053
You mess with them.
They're messing with you.

368
00:19:53,222 --> 00:19:55,019
All right, boys, send it in.

369
00:19:58,622 --> 00:20:00,374
Wait. What's that thing
straight ahead?

370
00:20:00,542 --> 00:20:02,612
ls that's anything? ls that Mothra?

371
00:20:04,022 --> 00:20:06,411
Let's check the desk.
That's where l heard the ticking.

372
00:20:06,582 --> 00:20:08,971
Search each of those drawers,
starting with the top one.

373
00:20:16,262 --> 00:20:20,540
lt's just empty calories
and male curiosity, eh, Georgie?

374
00:20:20,702 --> 00:20:22,772
Looks like there's more
compartments underneath.

375
00:20:22,942 --> 00:20:24,898
Compartments underneath?
Probably where it is.

376
00:20:25,062 --> 00:20:26,973
Okay, boys, let it rip.

377
00:20:31,782 --> 00:20:34,057
l'll tell you what,
starting tomorrow, no more desks.

378
00:20:34,222 --> 00:20:36,497
Just a Lucite table and four legs.

379
00:20:40,462 --> 00:20:44,171
Hey! Hey, watch
where you're kicking!

380
00:20:45,102 --> 00:20:47,058
You people find your own river!

381
00:20:47,222 --> 00:20:49,019
-Jeez!
-l'm so sor--

382
00:20:49,182 --> 00:20:50,934
-Kramer.
-Elaine.

383
00:20:51,102 --> 00:20:53,662
Hi. l am loving this.

384
00:20:53,822 --> 00:20:55,574
Hey, l'll meet you at the coffee shop.

385
00:20:55,742 --> 00:20:57,573
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

386
00:21:08,742 --> 00:21:10,698
Hey, Connie. Jerry around?

387
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:13,052
No, and l prefer Conrad.

388
00:21:14,542 --> 00:21:16,134
So l heard what happened
to the desk.

389
00:21:16,302 --> 00:21:19,339
There was something so reassuring
about that cozy little space.

390
00:21:19,502 --> 00:21:22,733
Yeah, well, whatever. See you.

391
00:21:25,502 --> 00:21:26,981
Back to normal.

392
00:21:27,142 --> 00:21:29,610
Not bad for 4000 bucks.

393
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:44,493
Can't believe l got the low-fat.
