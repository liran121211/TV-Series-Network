1
00:00:06,516 --> 00:00:08,347
Boy, l really miss
the Bermuda Triangle.

2
00:00:08,516 --> 00:00:10,666
Guess there's not much action
there these days.

3
00:00:10,836 --> 00:00:13,396
Oh, there's action.
There's plenty of action.

4
00:00:13,556 --> 00:00:15,990
lt's that damn alien autopsy
stealing the headlines.

5
00:00:16,156 --> 00:00:17,430
Yeah, tell me about it.

6
00:00:17,596 --> 00:00:20,793
See, what they gotta do is lose
a plane or a Greenpeace boat.

7
00:00:20,956 --> 00:00:22,992
See, that would get
the Triangle going again.

8
00:00:23,196 --> 00:00:26,154
What keeps the water there?
l mean, why doesn't that disappear?

9
00:00:27,156 --> 00:00:29,795
Now, what would be the point
of taking the water?

10
00:00:30,116 --> 00:00:31,947
lt's gorgeous water.

11
00:00:33,276 --> 00:00:34,595
Do we own Bermuda?

12
00:00:34,756 --> 00:00:36,906
No, it belongs to the British.

13
00:00:37,236 --> 00:00:39,067
Lucky Krauts.

14
00:00:40,756 --> 00:00:42,428
What do you think
of that autopsy?

15
00:00:42,596 --> 00:00:44,951
-Oh, that's real.
-l think so too.

16
00:00:50,636 --> 00:00:52,866
The doctor will be
with you in a moment.

17
00:01:01,676 --> 00:01:03,268
''Difficult''?

18
00:01:03,436 --> 00:01:06,269
Elaine, you shouldn't
be reading that.

19
00:01:06,436 --> 00:01:09,348
Now, tell me
about this rash of yours.

20
00:01:10,076 --> 00:01:11,794
Well, it's-- lt's....

21
00:01:12,956 --> 00:01:16,153
You know, l notice
that someone wrote in my chart...

22
00:01:16,316 --> 00:01:19,786
...that l was difficult
in January of '92.

23
00:01:19,956 --> 00:01:22,550
l have to tell you,
l remember that appointment exactly.

24
00:01:22,716 --> 00:01:26,026
You see, this nurse
had asked me to put a gown on...

25
00:01:26,196 --> 00:01:28,426
...but it was a mole on my shoulder...

26
00:01:28,596 --> 00:01:30,985
...and actually l had specifically
worn a tank top...

27
00:01:31,156 --> 00:01:33,829
...so that l wouldn't
have to put a gown on.

28
00:01:34,076 --> 00:01:36,829
You know, they're made of paper.

29
00:01:37,196 --> 00:01:39,835
Well, that was a long time ago.

30
00:01:40,036 --> 00:01:43,426
How about if l just erase it?

31
00:01:44,996 --> 00:01:48,511
Now, about that rash?

32
00:01:49,796 --> 00:01:51,468
But it was in pen.

33
00:01:53,236 --> 00:01:55,625
You fake erased.

34
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:59,276
All right, Miss Benes.
This doesn't look too serious.

35
00:01:59,436 --> 00:02:01,074
You should be fine.

36
00:02:01,276 --> 00:02:02,789
What are you writing?

37
00:02:03,876 --> 00:02:05,150
Doctor?

38
00:02:07,036 --> 00:02:09,231
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

39
00:02:09,436 --> 00:02:12,075
l hope you got that
mustard stain out of your shirt.

40
00:02:20,276 --> 00:02:22,187
Jerry, what's the matter
with your stereo?

41
00:02:22,356 --> 00:02:24,870
l don't know.
What's the matter with your stereo?

42
00:02:25,036 --> 00:02:27,311
l traded it to Lomez for some steaks.

43
00:02:28,116 --> 00:02:29,265
-Hey.
-Hey.

44
00:02:29,436 --> 00:02:31,392
-Now, see, this is busted.
-No, it works.

45
00:02:31,556 --> 00:02:33,308
-lt's busted.
-Watch. Let me show you.

46
00:02:33,476 --> 00:02:36,752
All you gotta do is-- You gotta
jiggle it with this screwdriver.

47
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:38,144
Smile.

48
00:02:38,316 --> 00:02:40,432
-What are you doing?
-l met this woman Sheila.

49
00:02:40,596 --> 00:02:42,791
She works down at the one-hour
photo place.

50
00:02:42,956 --> 00:02:45,993
She's got this incredible smile,
like she's got too many teeth.

51
00:02:46,156 --> 00:02:47,475
Extra teeth. l love that.

52
00:02:47,676 --> 00:02:50,634
And check this out. l go to pick up
my pictures and she says:

53
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:54,027
'' l hope you got that mustard stain
out of your shirt.''

54
00:02:54,196 --> 00:02:56,426
-What mustard stain?
-Don't you see?

55
00:02:56,596 --> 00:02:58,951
She's looking at my pictures.

56
00:02:59,116 --> 00:03:00,834
Why did you take a picture
of a stain?

57
00:03:01,356 --> 00:03:04,348
-lt's got nothing to do with this.
-l see, she's looking.

58
00:03:04,516 --> 00:03:06,552
Yes.

59
00:03:07,236 --> 00:03:08,589
You gotta get this fixed.

60
00:03:08,756 --> 00:03:10,826
They've tried.
lt keeps coming back the same.

61
00:03:10,996 --> 00:03:13,351
-You interested in a refund?
-l can't get a refund.

62
00:03:13,516 --> 00:03:16,553
-The warranty expired two years ago.
-Would you be interested?

63
00:03:16,716 --> 00:03:18,149
-How you gonna--?
-Would you?

64
00:03:18,316 --> 00:03:19,635
-l guess l would.
-Yeah, yeah.

65
00:03:21,156 --> 00:03:22,430
You are not gonna believe...

66
00:03:22,596 --> 00:03:25,064
...what happened to me
at the doctor's office today.

67
00:03:25,236 --> 00:03:26,828
Not the gown again?

68
00:03:27,796 --> 00:03:32,267
No. No. l was looking at my chart,
and it said that l was difficult.

69
00:03:32,436 --> 00:03:33,869
Why would they write that?

70
00:03:34,036 --> 00:03:35,264
They've gotten to know you.

71
00:03:35,836 --> 00:03:38,031
Then the doctor
writes more stuff down there...

72
00:03:38,196 --> 00:03:40,187
...and he doesn't
even look at my rash.

73
00:03:40,356 --> 00:03:42,267
Find one that doesn't
know you're difficult.

74
00:03:42,436 --> 00:03:45,234
Come on. l'm not difficult. l'm easy.

75
00:03:45,396 --> 00:03:47,956
Because you dress casual
and sleep with a lot of guys?

76
00:03:49,076 --> 00:03:50,668
-Listen, you little sh--
-Smile.

77
00:03:53,556 --> 00:03:56,275
Elaine, you really
didn't have to put on the gown.

78
00:03:56,756 --> 00:03:58,189
lt's my pleasure. l love these.

79
00:03:58,356 --> 00:04:00,028
ln fact, l've got one at home.

80
00:04:00,196 --> 00:04:02,505
lt's perfect when you
wanna throw something on.

81
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,032
-Hi.
-Thank you.

82
00:04:05,396 --> 00:04:06,988
All right.

83
00:04:07,636 --> 00:04:09,866
Let me just review your history
before we begin.

84
00:04:10,036 --> 00:04:12,596
Oh, where did you get my chart?

85
00:04:12,756 --> 00:04:15,475
From your last doctor.
lt's standard procedure.

86
00:04:15,636 --> 00:04:18,548
You know, l can tell you my
whole history. Let's just--

87
00:04:21,036 --> 00:04:22,185
Okay. Let's take a look.

88
00:04:23,076 --> 00:04:25,909
Well, that doesn't look too serious.
You'll be fine.

89
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:30,033
Please, please. lt--
But it's really, really itchy.

90
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,068
Oh, no.

91
00:04:41,396 --> 00:04:43,193
-Seinfeld?
-Yeah.

92
00:04:43,636 --> 00:04:45,706
Got a package for you. Sign here.

93
00:04:45,876 --> 00:04:48,390
-Oh, who's it from?
-No return address.

94
00:04:48,556 --> 00:04:49,705
What if l don't want it?

95
00:04:50,196 --> 00:04:51,709
Are you refusing delivery?

96
00:04:51,876 --> 00:04:53,514
-Maybe l am.
-Why would you do that?

97
00:04:53,676 --> 00:04:55,314
-Never done it before.
-Why start?

98
00:04:55,476 --> 00:04:56,875
Why not?

99
00:04:59,636 --> 00:05:01,228
All right.

100
00:05:04,556 --> 00:05:06,786
Why'd you refuse that?
Everybody loves a package.

101
00:05:06,956 --> 00:05:08,184
l don't know. lt was weird.

102
00:05:08,356 --> 00:05:10,028
Crazy printing.
l don't know who from.

103
00:05:10,356 --> 00:05:11,789
What do you think? lt's a bomb?

104
00:05:12,116 --> 00:05:13,868
lt's not totally impossible.

105
00:05:15,436 --> 00:05:17,188
The ego on you.

106
00:05:17,356 --> 00:05:20,587
-Why can't l be bomb-able?
-Who's gonna bomb you?

107
00:05:20,756 --> 00:05:24,066
An airline for all the stupid
little peanut jokes?

108
00:05:24,236 --> 00:05:26,830
Oh, l suppose you think
you're bomb-able?

109
00:05:26,996 --> 00:05:29,226
Couple people wouldn't mind
having me out of the way.

110
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:31,307
There's more than a couple.

111
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:34,350
Check these out.
l just picked them up from Sheila.

112
00:05:34,516 --> 00:05:36,427
She must have loved these.

113
00:05:36,596 --> 00:05:38,985
-You don't have a Mercedes.
-Just leaned on it...

114
00:05:39,156 --> 00:05:40,669
...so it'd look like mine.

115
00:05:40,836 --> 00:05:42,349
The driver seems put out.

116
00:05:42,516 --> 00:05:43,869
No, he was fine with it.

117
00:05:44,036 --> 00:05:45,674
Check this out.

118
00:05:46,436 --> 00:05:47,630
ls that Burt Reynolds?

119
00:05:48,156 --> 00:05:49,794
Wax Museum.

120
00:05:52,316 --> 00:05:55,149
-What is this?
-That is a lot of skin.

121
00:05:55,636 --> 00:05:58,594
This must be Sheila
from the photo place.

122
00:05:58,756 --> 00:06:01,554
-You can barely see her face.
-She must have slipped it in.

123
00:06:06,556 --> 00:06:10,469
-Photo-store Sheila.
-Well, hello, photo-store Sheila.

124
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:13,104
All right. l will see you boys later.

125
00:06:13,276 --> 00:06:15,346
-Where are you going?
-To ask her out.

126
00:06:15,516 --> 00:06:18,986
-No, no. You're not playing the game.
-What game?

127
00:06:19,156 --> 00:06:21,226
She goes to these lengths
to entice you...

128
00:06:21,396 --> 00:06:24,069
...and your only response is,
'' l really like your picture.

129
00:06:24,236 --> 00:06:26,989
Would you like to go out
on a date with me, please?''

130
00:06:28,756 --> 00:06:32,431
-No good?
-lt's the timeless art of seduction.

131
00:06:32,596 --> 00:06:35,986
You gotta join in the dance.
She sends you an enticing photo...

132
00:06:36,156 --> 00:06:39,307
-...you send her one right back.
-Oh, l don't know.

133
00:06:39,476 --> 00:06:42,832
Well, as you know, l've always
been something of a photog.

134
00:06:42,996 --> 00:06:45,829
Oh, yeah, l like this idea.

135
00:06:46,516 --> 00:06:48,029
Hey, Danny.

136
00:06:48,196 --> 00:06:51,154
-Hello. How are you?
-Hey, Leo.

137
00:06:51,316 --> 00:06:53,989
What's with your nephew?
He wouldn't accept the package.

138
00:06:54,156 --> 00:06:56,112
He wants it.
He's just trying to be funny.

139
00:06:56,276 --> 00:06:58,028
Yeah, l'll sign for it.

140
00:07:00,156 --> 00:07:02,192
And then he started
writing on my chart.

141
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,316
Just get ahold of it
and change what you don't like.

142
00:07:05,476 --> 00:07:07,592
You can't change your chart.
lt's your chart.

143
00:07:07,756 --> 00:07:09,712
l'm in my personnel file
all the time.

144
00:07:09,876 --> 00:07:13,425
-You are?
-l've kept the same job over two years.

145
00:07:13,596 --> 00:07:15,268
lt's not luck.

146
00:07:15,676 --> 00:07:18,668
Have you ever sent a racy
photograph of yourself to anyone?

147
00:07:19,516 --> 00:07:22,986
Yeah. l sent one to everyone l know.

148
00:07:23,156 --> 00:07:24,669
You remember my Christmas card?

149
00:07:25,316 --> 00:07:27,307
Oh, right.

150
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,395
The nipple.

151
00:07:34,276 --> 00:07:36,744
Aside from that, how did you feel
about Kramer's work?

152
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,827
Actually, l thought
he was professional.

153
00:07:38,996 --> 00:07:40,588
-lt was a good experience?
-Yeah.

154
00:07:40,756 --> 00:07:43,145
l liked the picture so much
l cropped out the nipple.

155
00:07:43,316 --> 00:07:45,068
l'm using it for my health-club lD.

156
00:07:45,236 --> 00:07:47,955
-Nice.
-Yeah, it is nice actually.

157
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:50,833
l've gotta see Dr. Berg right away.

158
00:07:50,996 --> 00:07:53,874
-This rash is spreading.
-He can't see you. He's busy.

159
00:07:54,036 --> 00:07:55,788
Oh, come on.
Have some compassion.

160
00:07:58,996 --> 00:08:02,033
Well, l hope it's contagious then.

161
00:08:18,036 --> 00:08:21,028
Come on. Move.

162
00:08:24,596 --> 00:08:26,473
Oh, hi, Dr. Berg.

163
00:08:26,636 --> 00:08:29,230
-l didn't know if--
-The chart, Miss Benes.

164
00:08:35,116 --> 00:08:37,630
Oh, please, no more.

165
00:08:40,996 --> 00:08:42,190
-Hey.
-Where's Kramer?

166
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:44,267
He went to get
some steak sauce. Why?

167
00:08:44,996 --> 00:08:46,270
Personal matter.

168
00:08:48,476 --> 00:08:52,867
-Hello.
-Jerry, it's your Uncle Leo. Hello.

169
00:08:53,036 --> 00:08:55,630
Hello, Leo. You don't have to yell.

170
00:08:55,996 --> 00:08:57,554
l got your package.

171
00:08:57,716 --> 00:09:00,355
-How did you get my package?
-Leo's got your package?

172
00:09:00,516 --> 00:09:03,076
-What should l do?
-l don't know what you should do.

173
00:09:03,236 --> 00:09:04,749
Tell him to open it.

174
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:08,033
l'm not gonna treat my uncle
like a bomb-defusing robot.

175
00:09:08,476 --> 00:09:10,353
Jerry, your cousin Jeffrey...

176
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:13,474
...is in a Parks Department
production of The Mikado.

177
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,706
l want you to come see it with me.

178
00:09:15,876 --> 00:09:19,312
-Open the package, Leo.
-Okay.

179
00:09:19,716 --> 00:09:22,230
Opening.

180
00:09:30,996 --> 00:09:32,190
So it wasn't a bomb?

181
00:09:32,356 --> 00:09:35,268
No. No bomb.

182
00:09:35,716 --> 00:09:37,991
-Well, then, what?
-Oh, stupid Leo.

183
00:09:38,156 --> 00:09:41,068
He was using those oven cleaners.
He left the canister in there.

184
00:09:41,236 --> 00:09:43,625
The pilot light was on.
The whole thing blew up.

185
00:09:43,956 --> 00:09:45,674
-But he's okay?
-Yeah.

186
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:48,634
The explosion singed off
his eyebrows, moustache, everything.

187
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:51,264
He's all smooth now.
Looks like a seal.

188
00:09:52,636 --> 00:09:54,354
Yes. Hi, yeah, l'm still holding.

189
00:09:54,516 --> 00:09:56,029
ls this my stereo?

190
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:58,514
Oh, hey, you got it.

191
00:09:58,676 --> 00:10:01,236
Hey, what happened to my stereo?
lt's all smashed up.

192
00:10:01,396 --> 00:10:04,433
That's right. Now it looks
like it was broken during shipping...

193
00:10:04,596 --> 00:10:06,507
...and l insured it for $400.

194
00:10:06,676 --> 00:10:08,428
You were supposed to
get me a refund.

195
00:10:08,596 --> 00:10:11,588
You can't get a refund.
Your warranty expired two years ago.

196
00:10:13,076 --> 00:10:15,954
So we're gonna make the post office
pay for my new stereo now?

197
00:10:16,156 --> 00:10:18,750
-lt's a write-off for them.
-How is it a write-off?

198
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:20,395
They just write it off.

199
00:10:20,956 --> 00:10:22,355
Write it off what?

200
00:10:22,516 --> 00:10:25,394
Jerry, all these big companies,
they write off everything.

201
00:10:26,076 --> 00:10:28,590
You don't even know
what a write-off is.

202
00:10:30,116 --> 00:10:32,584
-Do you?
-No, l don't.

203
00:10:32,876 --> 00:10:34,150
But they do.

204
00:10:34,316 --> 00:10:37,069
And they're the ones writing it off.

205
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:43,146
l wish l had the last 20 seconds
of my life back.

206
00:10:43,316 --> 00:10:48,265
What? What? He doesn't have
one appointment this whole month?

207
00:10:48,436 --> 00:10:51,792
Oh, come on. l'm dying here, man.

208
00:10:51,956 --> 00:10:54,914
Hello? Hello?

209
00:10:57,756 --> 00:10:58,984
Still no luck?

210
00:10:59,156 --> 00:11:02,034
Jerry, that was Dr. Zimmerman.
l'm at the end of the alphabet.

211
00:11:02,196 --> 00:11:04,391
There's no Zorn or Zutroff?

212
00:11:04,556 --> 00:11:07,946
They're on vacation. Every doctor
in this city seems to know who l am.

213
00:11:08,316 --> 00:11:09,874
Hey, what about Dr. Resnick?

214
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:11,788
My Uncle Leo's
gonna see him tomorrow.

215
00:11:11,956 --> 00:11:14,516
Dr. Resnick. He's not listed.

216
00:11:14,676 --> 00:11:16,348
He's not that good.

217
00:11:16,516 --> 00:11:18,950
Elaine said you were
pretty good at this stuff.

218
00:11:19,116 --> 00:11:22,313
Oh, yeah. Elaine was a fun project.
l enjoyed working with her.

219
00:11:23,756 --> 00:11:25,986
-You don't have your own camera?
-No.

220
00:11:26,836 --> 00:11:28,349
Oh, boy, look at this.

221
00:11:28,516 --> 00:11:30,632
Yeah. Okay.

222
00:11:30,796 --> 00:11:32,149
This looks good.

223
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:33,749
Very, very, good.

224
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,474
And l like what you're wearing.

225
00:11:35,836 --> 00:11:38,225
-l feel fat.
-No, no. You're stout.

226
00:11:38,396 --> 00:11:40,068
The camera loves stoutness.

227
00:11:40,636 --> 00:11:43,753
Look, we're not gonna do anything
that makes you feel uncomfortable.

228
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:46,066
The key word is ''tasteful.''

229
00:11:46,236 --> 00:11:49,672
Now, l want to you relax and have fun
because you're a fun guy.

230
00:11:51,156 --> 00:11:52,908
All right. Let's do it, huh?

231
00:11:53,076 --> 00:11:56,273
Yeah. Yeah.

232
00:11:56,836 --> 00:11:59,908
Okay. Come on. Feel the beat.

233
00:12:00,076 --> 00:12:02,988
Feel the beat. All right.

234
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:06,831
You know, you got real strong pecs,
but it's hard to tell under that T-shirt.

235
00:12:06,996 --> 00:12:10,193
-You want me to take it off?
-Well, l don't know. lt's up to you.

236
00:12:10,356 --> 00:12:12,995
-lt would be better?
-Might be. Whatever you want.

237
00:12:13,156 --> 00:12:15,954
-All right. Come on.
-Yeah.

238
00:12:16,116 --> 00:12:19,028
That's it. Come on, George.
That's it. Come on. Give it to me.

239
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:21,551
Come on. Work it.
Work it. Oh, yeah.

240
00:12:21,716 --> 00:12:25,345
Hold it. Hold it.
Yeah, be a man. Be a man.

241
00:12:25,516 --> 00:12:28,269
Lover boy. You are a lover boy.

242
00:12:28,436 --> 00:12:30,791
Oh, yeah. This can't miss.

243
00:12:40,196 --> 00:12:41,390
Hello?

244
00:12:41,556 --> 00:12:43,786
Is this Elaine Marie Benes?

245
00:12:43,956 --> 00:12:46,550
Yeah. Who's this?

246
00:12:46,716 --> 00:12:50,425
We're with the American Medical
Association, the AMA.

247
00:12:50,596 --> 00:12:53,349
Can you confirm the correct spelling
of your last name?

248
00:12:53,516 --> 00:12:55,632
Is it B-E-N-E-S?

249
00:12:56,356 --> 00:12:59,473
Yeah. What is this about?

250
00:12:59,636 --> 00:13:01,035
Goodbye.

251
00:13:01,956 --> 00:13:03,469
Hello?

252
00:13:03,636 --> 00:13:05,433
-Hello?
-What?

253
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:09,305
Get off the line.
We're trying to mak e another call.

254
00:13:09,476 --> 00:13:11,592
Oh, sorry.

255
00:13:16,876 --> 00:13:19,185
Elaine. Hello.
What are you doing here?

256
00:13:19,556 --> 00:13:22,673
-Has the doctor been in yet?
-No, l'll ask him about my eyebrows.

257
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:25,828
Okay. Listen, Leo.
You're hairless, you're scared.

258
00:13:25,996 --> 00:13:29,705
When the doctor comes in, you just
let me do the talking, okay? Okay.

259
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:32,749
Leo. l understand
you had a little mishap.

260
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,634
lt was a fireball.

261
00:13:34,796 --> 00:13:37,356
l never should have left him alone.

262
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:42,670
-And who are you?
-l'm his nurse. Paloma.

263
00:13:42,836 --> 00:13:45,225
You're not my nurse.

264
00:13:45,556 --> 00:13:48,673
He has good days and bad.

265
00:13:48,836 --> 00:13:50,349
What seems to be the problem?

266
00:13:50,516 --> 00:13:54,634
-Are my eyebrows gonna grow back?
-And he seems to have a bit of a rash.

267
00:13:54,996 --> 00:13:56,509
-Really?
-Yeah.

268
00:13:56,996 --> 00:14:00,625
Well, there's been a bit of that
going around lately.

269
00:14:00,876 --> 00:14:02,912
Will you excuse me
a minute, Paloma?

270
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:05,636
l'm just going to get some ointment.

271
00:14:09,076 --> 00:14:10,794
l don't like this. This is too easy.

272
00:14:10,956 --> 00:14:13,948
-Elaine--
-Shut up. l think he's onto us.

273
00:14:15,436 --> 00:14:17,233
Elaine, what about my eyebrows?

274
00:14:17,396 --> 00:14:18,795
Here. Here.

275
00:14:21,396 --> 00:14:22,988
l don't like this, Kramer.

276
00:14:23,836 --> 00:14:25,394
Will it be much longer?

277
00:14:25,556 --> 00:14:28,150
l'm sorry. lt looks like the claim
has been red-flagged.

278
00:14:28,316 --> 00:14:29,874
You're under investigation.

279
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,504
-lnvestigation?
-Hello, Jerry.

280
00:14:34,356 --> 00:14:36,028
Hello, Newman.

281
00:14:36,196 --> 00:14:40,155
Kramer, you might as well
run along.

282
00:14:40,316 --> 00:14:41,954
Jerry may be a while.

283
00:14:42,116 --> 00:14:44,755
Suspicion of mail fraud.

284
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,190
Mail fraud?

285
00:14:46,356 --> 00:14:48,631
You're in a lot of trouble, buddy.

286
00:14:51,876 --> 00:14:54,185
Okay, l've got your ointment.
Where's your--

287
00:14:54,356 --> 00:14:56,916
-Where's your nurse?
-She left.

288
00:14:57,556 --> 00:15:00,628
Whoa, whoa, no need to get angry.

289
00:15:00,796 --> 00:15:03,310
-Calm down.
-l am calm.

290
00:15:03,476 --> 00:15:05,228
Leo, l don't care for your demeanour.

291
00:15:05,396 --> 00:15:06,909
Demeanour?

292
00:15:07,276 --> 00:15:08,914
Now you're just being difficult.

293
00:15:09,276 --> 00:15:11,028
What are you writing?

294
00:15:12,156 --> 00:15:17,389
So l really liked the pictures
l picked up here yesterday.

295
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,110
l'm glad, George.

296
00:15:19,276 --> 00:15:21,551
And here's a little roll...

297
00:15:21,716 --> 00:15:24,071
...that l think you may enjoy.

298
00:15:24,276 --> 00:15:25,470
Great.

299
00:15:25,636 --> 00:15:27,627
Shall we say an hour?

300
00:15:33,076 --> 00:15:34,987
l gotta go to lunch.
Could you do a roll?

301
00:15:35,396 --> 00:15:36,988
No problem.

302
00:15:37,156 --> 00:15:39,624
By the way, you know that model
who's always in here?

303
00:15:39,796 --> 00:15:41,832
She's missing
one of her lingerie shots.

304
00:15:41,996 --> 00:15:44,590
-Have you seen it?
-No.

305
00:15:44,756 --> 00:15:46,474
All right. All right.

306
00:15:48,436 --> 00:15:50,631
Then let me ask you this:

307
00:15:51,956 --> 00:15:55,471
Don't you find it interesting
that your friend had the foresight...

308
00:15:55,636 --> 00:15:58,594
...to purchase postal insurance
for your stereo? Huh?

309
00:15:58,756 --> 00:16:01,714
l mean, parcels are rarely
damaged during shipping.

310
00:16:02,156 --> 00:16:05,228
-Define '' rarely.''
-Frequently.

311
00:16:06,836 --> 00:16:08,747
Are we about through here, Newman?

312
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:13,665
lt's pretty hot
under these lights, huh, Seinfeld?

313
00:16:14,036 --> 00:16:16,994
Pretty hot.

314
00:16:19,516 --> 00:16:21,586
Actually, l'm quite comfortable.

315
00:16:27,316 --> 00:16:29,546
-Can l have a sip?
-No.

316
00:16:31,516 --> 00:16:33,984
Not gonna play ball, huh?

317
00:16:34,156 --> 00:16:35,794
All right. Admit it.

318
00:16:35,956 --> 00:16:38,026
That stereo was already busted.

319
00:16:38,196 --> 00:16:39,868
You can't prove anything.

320
00:16:40,036 --> 00:16:42,596
ls this or is this not your signature?

321
00:16:43,116 --> 00:16:44,913
No, as a matter of fact, it isn't.

322
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,588
'' Uncle Leo''?

323
00:16:51,516 --> 00:16:54,030
This case is closed
pending further evidence.

324
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:00,670
Jerry!

325
00:17:03,316 --> 00:17:05,784
Get in there, get the chart,
and get out. You got it?

326
00:17:05,956 --> 00:17:07,947
No problem.
Let me borrow your scarf.

327
00:17:08,116 --> 00:17:09,708
-What? This?
-Yeah. lt's nice. Yeah.

328
00:17:10,236 --> 00:17:12,830
-Here.
-Yeah. All right.

329
00:17:13,516 --> 00:17:15,313
-One chart coming up.
-Okay.

330
00:17:15,476 --> 00:17:16,909
lt's Bennett, right?

331
00:17:17,076 --> 00:17:18,828
lt's Benes, you jackass.

332
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,907
My last name is Benes.

333
00:17:22,836 --> 00:17:24,189
Yeah.

334
00:17:25,996 --> 00:17:27,588
Jerry. Jerry.

335
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:30,350
Jerry. Jerry. Jerry.

336
00:17:31,956 --> 00:17:34,345
Jerry. Jerry?

337
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:39,031
Jerry.

338
00:17:39,956 --> 00:17:42,151
So l like what you've done there.

339
00:17:44,276 --> 00:17:45,709
-May l help you?
-Yes, yes.

340
00:17:45,876 --> 00:17:49,471
l'm Dr. Van Nostrund
from the clinic.

341
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:51,592
l'm gonna need Elaine Benes' chart.

342
00:17:51,756 --> 00:17:54,589
She's a patient of mine.

343
00:17:55,076 --> 00:17:57,465
l don't think she's gonna make it.
lt's very bad.

344
00:17:57,636 --> 00:18:00,104
Very, very messy.

345
00:18:00,276 --> 00:18:02,107
l see. And what clinic is that again?

346
00:18:02,516 --> 00:18:04,108
That's correct.

347
00:18:05,196 --> 00:18:08,233
- Excuse me?
-From the Hoffermandorf Neo Clinic...

348
00:18:08,396 --> 00:18:10,512
-...in Belgium.
-Oh, really?

349
00:18:10,996 --> 00:18:12,190
The Netherlands?

350
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:17,668
-Where's my chart? Did you get it?
-No.

351
00:18:17,836 --> 00:18:19,269
-What happened?
-l don't know.

352
00:18:19,436 --> 00:18:20,664
Now they got a chart on me.

353
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,713
l don't know where they could be.

354
00:18:23,876 --> 00:18:25,309
You can't find them.

355
00:18:25,476 --> 00:18:26,670
That's marvellous.

356
00:18:26,836 --> 00:18:28,872
The dance continues.

357
00:18:29,236 --> 00:18:30,908
Well, if l find them l'll call you.

358
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:34,512
Great. And maybe we could
go out and do something.

359
00:18:34,676 --> 00:18:36,075
Sure.

360
00:18:39,276 --> 00:18:40,595
Hello.

361
00:18:43,836 --> 00:18:45,315
Hi.

362
00:18:52,436 --> 00:18:55,872
-So the little guy finally asked me out.
-Really?

363
00:18:56,036 --> 00:18:58,106
Hey, l can't find
his photos anywhere.

364
00:18:58,276 --> 00:19:00,915
You know, some guy from
the post office confiscated them.

365
00:19:01,076 --> 00:19:02,270
He left his card.

366
00:19:06,716 --> 00:19:08,752
l don't know what Newman
wanted me for.

367
00:19:09,236 --> 00:19:11,591
Gentlemen. Gentlemen.

368
00:19:11,756 --> 00:19:15,305
l'm so happy to see you both.

369
00:19:15,476 --> 00:19:18,468
There's just some inconsistencies
l'd like to straighten out.

370
00:19:18,636 --> 00:19:22,515
-l'm clean, Newman, and you know it.
-Clean? Hardly.

371
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:26,309
This doesn't look like a man...

372
00:19:26,476 --> 00:19:29,991
...who's happy with his stereo
performance, now, does it?

373
00:19:30,156 --> 00:19:32,112
-Where did you get that?
-That's mine.

374
00:19:32,276 --> 00:19:35,871
Looks like you're breaking into it
like an otter cracks open a clam.

375
00:19:36,396 --> 00:19:38,671
Don't know about that,
but there's an explanation.

376
00:19:38,836 --> 00:19:42,351
Yes. lt's called ''mail fraud.''

377
00:19:42,876 --> 00:19:45,674
How l've longed
for this moment, Seinfeld.

378
00:19:45,836 --> 00:19:47,872
The day l would have
the proof l needed...

379
00:19:48,036 --> 00:19:50,345
...to haul you out of your cushy lair...

380
00:19:50,516 --> 00:19:54,555
...and expose you to the light of justice
as the monster that you are.

381
00:19:54,716 --> 00:19:57,549
-A monster so vile--
-Newman!

382
00:20:00,156 --> 00:20:03,148
There'll be a small fine.

383
00:20:03,316 --> 00:20:04,908
Okay.

384
00:20:05,076 --> 00:20:09,388
-Can we go now?
-Not so fast, pretty boy.

385
00:20:10,556 --> 00:20:14,754
There's more to this
sordid little affair.

386
00:20:20,116 --> 00:20:22,152
Oh, my God.

387
00:20:22,316 --> 00:20:24,750
This photo clearly indicates
your involvement...

388
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:29,387
...in some ill-conceived
mail-order pornography ring.

389
00:20:29,556 --> 00:20:35,188
As does this one,
found in the same disturbing packet.

390
00:20:38,116 --> 00:20:40,107
Oh, my God!

391
00:20:40,476 --> 00:20:44,105
We have a few questions
we'd like you to answer.

392
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:47,154
l have a few questions of my own.

393
00:20:47,676 --> 00:20:49,075
Hi. One of your mailmen--

394
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:52,746
Oh, my God. George.

395
00:20:52,956 --> 00:20:55,265
Well, Sheila, it's not what you think.

396
00:20:55,436 --> 00:20:57,233
l put my trust in the wrong person.

397
00:20:57,396 --> 00:21:00,229
He said the key word was ''tasteful.''

398
00:21:01,196 --> 00:21:03,869
The timeless art of seduction.

399
00:21:16,756 --> 00:21:18,747
Oh, gee.

400
00:21:19,156 --> 00:21:21,272
That wasn't such a long drive.

401
00:21:21,476 --> 00:21:23,194
The dirt road really hurt my back.

402
00:21:23,356 --> 00:21:25,631
Okay, please,
everybody just stop complaining.

403
00:21:25,796 --> 00:21:27,912
Smile. We're good patients.

404
00:21:28,076 --> 00:21:30,590
Okay, Miss Benes,
you wanna come on back?

405
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:32,986
-Oh, l'd love to.
-Oh, just a second.

406
00:21:33,156 --> 00:21:34,828
-Okay.
-Hello.

407
00:21:35,156 --> 00:21:36,589
Yes.

408
00:21:36,756 --> 00:21:39,429
Well, as a matter of fact,
they're here right now.

409
00:21:40,756 --> 00:21:42,189
l understand.
