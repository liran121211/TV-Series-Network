1
00:00:04,997 --> 00:00:07,465
-The last president to have a beard?
-Nixon.

2
00:00:07,637 --> 00:00:10,356
-No, l mean a real thick beard.
-His was thick.

3
00:00:10,517 --> 00:00:13,589
No, l mean like a full, long beard,
like Smith Brothers Cough Drops.

4
00:00:13,757 --> 00:00:14,746
Falkmore.

5
00:00:14,917 --> 00:00:17,636
-Who?
-Artemis N. Falkmore.

6
00:00:17,797 --> 00:00:19,355
-You made that up, right?
-Yeah.

7
00:00:19,517 --> 00:00:21,394
-But it sounds like a president name?
-Yeah.

8
00:00:21,557 --> 00:00:23,149
Why do presidents all
have bad names?

9
00:00:23,317 --> 00:00:24,670
Woodrow, Grover, Millard.

10
00:00:24,837 --> 00:00:26,828
The presidency attracts
the badly named.

11
00:00:26,997 --> 00:00:28,988
Their ambition is based on
personal insecurity.

12
00:00:29,157 --> 00:00:30,795
lt's classic male overcompensation.

13
00:00:30,957 --> 00:00:33,630
Are you wearing lifts
in those shoes?

14
00:00:34,597 --> 00:00:36,155
Cab.

15
00:00:40,997 --> 00:00:43,557
So they have this clock now,
where you punch in your age...

16
00:00:43,717 --> 00:00:45,469
...and all your risk factors...

17
00:00:45,637 --> 00:00:48,674
...and it actually counts down
how much time you have left to live.

18
00:00:48,837 --> 00:00:50,668
What's the great moment?
On your deathbed.

19
00:00:50,837 --> 00:00:54,352
They're pounding on your chest,
and you're going: ''Ten, nine, eight--

20
00:00:54,517 --> 00:00:56,348
l told you this thing was good.''

21
00:00:57,357 --> 00:01:00,110
-l can't believe this is our first date.
-l know. Dessert?

22
00:01:00,277 --> 00:01:02,507
l suppose l have to get
a piece of cake.

23
00:01:02,677 --> 00:01:05,635
-Why?
-Today is my birthday.

24
00:01:05,797 --> 00:01:07,594
What? Today?

25
00:01:07,757 --> 00:01:08,872
-Really?
-Yep.

26
00:01:20,157 --> 00:01:23,547
So she went out with you
on a first date and it was her birthday?

27
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:25,947
Yeah, and she picked the day.

28
00:01:26,117 --> 00:01:27,596
ls she socially...

29
00:01:27,797 --> 00:01:29,116
...awkward?

30
00:01:29,277 --> 00:01:30,471
No, she's great.

31
00:01:30,637 --> 00:01:33,435
-She's attractive and fun.
-Well, maybe she decided...

32
00:01:33,597 --> 00:01:36,270
...to celebrate her birthday on
the Monday after the weekend.

33
00:01:36,437 --> 00:01:38,792
She's not Lincoln.

34
00:01:39,477 --> 00:01:40,796
Hey.

35
00:01:41,397 --> 00:01:42,955
Anybody up for Lorenzo's pizza?

36
00:01:43,117 --> 00:01:44,994
-l'll pass.
-Oh, really?

37
00:01:45,157 --> 00:01:47,990
Hey, George. Pizza.

38
00:01:48,157 --> 00:01:50,227
l can't. l gotta go down
to the foundation.

39
00:01:50,397 --> 00:01:54,185
l'm interviewing high schoolers
for the Susan Ross Scholarship.

40
00:01:54,797 --> 00:01:56,913
Does it ever bother you
that this organization...

41
00:01:57,077 --> 00:01:58,590
-Nope.
-...is beating the bushes...

42
00:01:58,757 --> 00:02:01,715
-No.
-...to basically give this money away...

43
00:02:01,877 --> 00:02:03,469
-No.
-...to virtually anyone...

44
00:02:03,637 --> 00:02:05,389
...as long as they're not you?

45
00:02:05,557 --> 00:02:06,831
l'm fine with it.

46
00:02:06,997 --> 00:02:08,828
Fine, l say.

47
00:02:11,837 --> 00:02:15,386
And then l received a 7 40
on the English Achievement Test.

48
00:02:15,557 --> 00:02:17,548
Quick, what's your favourite animal?

49
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:21,395
l don't know. Frog?

50
00:02:22,277 --> 00:02:23,471
Frog?

51
00:02:24,037 --> 00:02:26,790
-Well, l--
-Frog is wrong.

52
00:02:28,437 --> 00:02:30,507
l see here that you play the harp.

53
00:02:31,197 --> 00:02:33,836
Tell me, why do they have to tilt it?

54
00:02:35,277 --> 00:02:37,108
Can't they just build it on an angle?

55
00:02:37,277 --> 00:02:38,835
Save you a lot of trouble.

56
00:02:38,997 --> 00:02:42,034
Well, the modern-day harp has been
refined over thousands of years...

57
00:02:42,197 --> 00:02:45,269
-...back to--
-Yeah, yeah, we'll let you know.

58
00:02:46,957 --> 00:02:50,427
l see your GPA is 4.0.

59
00:02:50,597 --> 00:02:52,189
You like that, don't you?

60
00:02:54,717 --> 00:02:58,756
So, Steven, l see you're
president of the chess club.

61
00:02:59,517 --> 00:03:01,075
State champs.

62
00:03:01,717 --> 00:03:03,389
Who's your favourite chess player?

63
00:03:05,717 --> 00:03:07,469
Nastercoff?

64
00:03:11,477 --> 00:03:12,910
Right.

65
00:03:13,077 --> 00:03:14,749
Nastercoff.

66
00:03:17,557 --> 00:03:19,115
What country is he from again?

67
00:03:20,277 --> 00:03:22,154
l don't know.

68
00:03:23,157 --> 00:03:24,875
l made it up.

69
00:03:25,317 --> 00:03:26,796
l'm never gonna get this thing.

70
00:03:28,237 --> 00:03:29,590
What are you telling me for?

71
00:03:29,757 --> 00:03:31,907
You really had me going there.

72
00:03:32,077 --> 00:03:34,272
Come on, sit down.

73
00:03:36,637 --> 00:03:38,355
What do you want to do
when you grow up?

74
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:42,592
Well, l've been telling people
that l'd like to be an architect.

75
00:03:47,797 --> 00:03:51,233
So get this, Mr. Peterman is finally
letting me do some real writing.

76
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,547
He's got this book deal
for his autobiography.

77
00:03:53,717 --> 00:03:55,275
He's gonna let me ghostwrite it.

78
00:03:55,437 --> 00:03:57,075
Wow, that's great.
When it comes out...

79
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,626
...l'll have to get someone
to ghost-read it.

80
00:03:59,797 --> 00:04:00,946
-Hey. Oh, hi.
-Hey.

81
00:04:01,117 --> 00:04:02,914
-Hey.
-So there l am at Lorenzo's...

82
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:06,467
...loading up my slice
at the fixings bar.

83
00:04:06,637 --> 00:04:09,310
Garlic and whatnot.

84
00:04:09,997 --> 00:04:11,953
When l see this guy over at
the pizza boxes...

85
00:04:12,117 --> 00:04:14,347
...giving me the stink eye.

86
00:04:16,317 --> 00:04:19,354
So l give him the crook eye back,
you know?

87
00:04:21,397 --> 00:04:23,149
And l notice that he's not alone.

88
00:04:23,317 --> 00:04:26,275
l'm taking on
the entire Van Buren Boys.

89
00:04:26,437 --> 00:04:27,665
-Van Buren Boys?
-Yeah.

90
00:04:27,837 --> 00:04:30,590
There's a street gang named after
President Martin Van Buren?

91
00:04:30,757 --> 00:04:33,430
Oh, yeah, and they're
just as mean as he was.

92
00:04:33,597 --> 00:04:35,713
So l make a move to
the door, you know?

93
00:04:35,877 --> 00:04:37,071
They block it.

94
00:04:37,237 --> 00:04:40,309
So l lunge for the bathroom.
l grab the knob.

95
00:04:40,477 --> 00:04:42,069
Occupied.

96
00:04:43,997 --> 00:04:47,785
Then they back me up
against the cartoon map of ltaly...

97
00:04:47,957 --> 00:04:50,835
...and all of a sudden they just stop.

98
00:04:50,997 --> 00:04:52,396
What? What happened?

99
00:04:52,557 --> 00:04:55,913
Because l'm still holding
the garlic shaker, like this:

100
00:04:56,077 --> 00:04:57,556
l'm only showing eight fingers.

101
00:04:57,717 --> 00:05:00,948
-Well, what does that mean?
-That's their secret sign.

102
00:05:02,477 --> 00:05:05,867
See, Van Buren, he was
the eighth president.

103
00:05:06,037 --> 00:05:07,948
They thought l was
a former Van B Boy.

104
00:05:10,037 --> 00:05:13,154
-How was the pizza?
-lt was a little oily.

105
00:05:14,997 --> 00:05:17,716
Jerry, can you hold on a sec?
l just wanna check my messages.

106
00:05:20,277 --> 00:05:21,471
Oh, Melissa, Kim.

107
00:05:22,037 --> 00:05:24,426
-Ellen.
-Hey. l want you to meet Jerry.

108
00:05:24,597 --> 00:05:27,714
Oh, we've heard a lot about you.

109
00:05:28,757 --> 00:05:31,225
lt is so sweet of you to take her out.

110
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:33,547
Yeah, you don't even know
how much she needs this.

111
00:05:33,717 --> 00:05:35,275
ls she coming off a bad breakup?

112
00:05:35,437 --> 00:05:36,586
No.

113
00:05:36,757 --> 00:05:38,236
See you.

114
00:05:41,237 --> 00:05:44,274
-Get your messages?
-Yeah. No one called.

115
00:05:46,997 --> 00:05:49,716
They acted like it was some
act of charity, going out with her.

116
00:05:49,877 --> 00:05:51,708
So she's the loser of the group.

117
00:05:51,877 --> 00:05:54,994
Every group has someone
that they all make fun of.

118
00:05:55,157 --> 00:05:57,352
Like us with Elaine.

119
00:06:02,197 --> 00:06:04,586
There's no way Ellen
is the loser of that group.

120
00:06:04,757 --> 00:06:07,476
Are you looking deep down
at the real person underneath?

121
00:06:07,637 --> 00:06:10,595
No, l'm being as superficial
as l possibly can.

122
00:06:11,837 --> 00:06:14,067
-Well, stick with it.
-Yeah.

123
00:06:14,237 --> 00:06:16,467
-l found someone for the scholarship.
-Yeah?

124
00:06:16,637 --> 00:06:19,834
l'm interviewing all these
annoying little overachievers...

125
00:06:19,997 --> 00:06:23,353
...and finally this kid walks in,
Steven Koren, a regular guy.

126
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:25,473
Likes sports, watches TV.

127
00:06:25,637 --> 00:06:28,913
-ls he smart?
-He knows how to read.

128
00:06:29,957 --> 00:06:34,109
And he also knows that finishing
an entire book doesn't prove anything.

129
00:06:34,277 --> 00:06:35,551
But get this:

130
00:06:35,717 --> 00:06:37,150
He's into architecture.

131
00:06:37,317 --> 00:06:39,785
Hey, just like you pretend to be.

132
00:06:41,637 --> 00:06:44,026
Yes, with a little guidance...

133
00:06:44,197 --> 00:06:47,428
...Steven Koren is going to be
everything l claim to be, only for real.

134
00:06:49,077 --> 00:06:50,476
That's my dream, Jerry.

135
00:06:50,637 --> 00:06:54,915
l had a dream last night
that a hamburger was eating me.

136
00:07:01,397 --> 00:07:04,434
Mr. Peterman, thanks
for having me over. l--

137
00:07:04,997 --> 00:07:07,113
Your place isn't quite
what l imagined.

138
00:07:07,277 --> 00:07:10,428
Oh, it's just a place to flop.

139
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:15,072
Well, what part of your life
do you want to start with?

140
00:07:15,237 --> 00:07:17,797
Foreign intrigue? Exotic romances?

141
00:07:17,957 --> 00:07:20,915
Oh, Elaine, we've covered all of that
in the catalog, ad nauseam.

142
00:07:21,077 --> 00:07:24,194
No, l would like this book
to be about my day-to-day life.

143
00:07:25,877 --> 00:07:28,152
Oh, damn, they changed
the cable stations again...

144
00:07:28,317 --> 00:07:30,831
...just when l finally
memorized them.

145
00:07:31,757 --> 00:07:33,987
-Well, Mr. Peterman, do you want to--?
-Two: CBS.

146
00:07:34,157 --> 00:07:36,512
-Get started?
-Three....

147
00:07:36,677 --> 00:07:38,952
l don't know what that is.

148
00:07:39,797 --> 00:07:42,152
Where's my damn
preview channel?

149
00:07:43,957 --> 00:07:46,391
Well, l gotta tell you, Mr. Peterman...

150
00:07:46,557 --> 00:07:49,196
...l don't know if l see
a whole book here.

151
00:07:49,797 --> 00:07:52,186
Well, l'm sure we'll
come up with something.

152
00:07:52,357 --> 00:07:54,996
What do you say you and l
order ourselves a pie?

153
00:07:55,157 --> 00:07:56,556
Do you like Lorenzo's?

154
00:07:57,797 --> 00:08:01,870
A friend of mine almost got beat up
at that place by the Van Buren Boys.

155
00:08:02,037 --> 00:08:03,186
-You don't say?
-Yeah.

156
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:04,836
The only thing that saved
him is...

157
00:08:04,997 --> 00:08:07,147
...he accidentally flashed
their secret gang sign.

158
00:08:07,597 --> 00:08:09,189
-Well, that's pretty exciting.
-Yeah.

159
00:08:09,357 --> 00:08:11,313
Let's put that in the book.

160
00:08:13,317 --> 00:08:15,228
But that didn't happen to you.

161
00:08:15,397 --> 00:08:19,231
Well, so we pay off your friend,
and it becomes a Peterman.

162
00:08:20,717 --> 00:08:22,787
No, l really don't think
you can do that.

163
00:08:22,957 --> 00:08:27,633
Oh, damn, l forgot to buy
plant food again.

164
00:08:28,117 --> 00:08:31,029
l'll bet l got a coupon for it.

165
00:08:32,717 --> 00:08:35,106
You know what?
Maybe l better talk to my friend.

166
00:08:40,037 --> 00:08:42,505
ls that the same outfit
you were wearing yesterday?

167
00:08:42,677 --> 00:08:44,986
No, this is brand-new.
Do you like it?

168
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:46,670
Actually, yeah.

169
00:08:49,557 --> 00:08:52,867
Wait a second.
ls that the fork that fell on the floor?

170
00:08:53,037 --> 00:08:56,347
Are you using the fork
that fell on the floor?

171
00:08:56,517 --> 00:08:58,951
No, Jerry, the waitress
gave me another one.

172
00:08:59,117 --> 00:09:01,392
l guess that's all right.

173
00:09:01,557 --> 00:09:06,233
-ls something wrong, Jerry?
-No, absolutely nothing.

174
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:08,435
You're fantastic.

175
00:09:09,517 --> 00:09:10,745
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

176
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:12,748
Kramer, George, this is Ellen.

177
00:09:18,277 --> 00:09:21,349
Ladies and gentlemen,
l am happy to introduce you...

178
00:09:21,517 --> 00:09:24,395
...to the first Susan Ross Scholar.

179
00:09:24,557 --> 00:09:25,672
This...

180
00:09:25,837 --> 00:09:27,395
...is Steven Koren.

181
00:09:28,477 --> 00:09:32,026
His GPA is a solid 2.0.

182
00:09:33,117 --> 00:09:35,677
Right in that meaty part
of the curve.

183
00:09:35,837 --> 00:09:38,431
Not showing off, not falling behind.

184
00:09:38,597 --> 00:09:40,747
George, the qualifications
for this scholarship...

185
00:09:40,917 --> 00:09:43,272
...were supposed to be
largely academic.

186
00:09:43,477 --> 00:09:45,388
l'm sure we're all aware
of the flaws...

187
00:09:45,557 --> 00:09:47,627
...and biases of standardized tests.

188
00:09:47,797 --> 00:09:50,789
These aren't standardized tests.
These are his grades.

189
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:54,506
Besides, Steven Koren has
the highest of aspirations.

190
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,747
He wants to be...

191
00:09:57,237 --> 00:09:58,829
...an architect.

192
00:09:58,997 --> 00:10:00,191
ls that right?

193
00:10:00,357 --> 00:10:03,235
Actually, maybe l could set
my sights a little bit higher.

194
00:10:03,397 --> 00:10:06,912
Steven, nothing is higher
than architect.

195
00:10:07,517 --> 00:10:09,826
l think l'd really like to be
a city planner.

196
00:10:09,997 --> 00:10:13,034
Why limit myself to one building
when l can design a whole city?

197
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:15,028
-Well, that's a good point.
-No, it's not.

198
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,267
lsn't an architect just
an art school dropout...

199
00:10:17,437 --> 00:10:19,393
...with a tilting desk and a big ruler?

200
00:10:19,557 --> 00:10:21,707
lt's called a T-square.

201
00:10:22,157 --> 00:10:25,354
You know, the stupidest guy
in my fraternity became an architect...

202
00:10:25,517 --> 00:10:27,473
...after he flunked
out of dental school.

203
00:10:29,237 --> 00:10:30,636
Congratulations, young man.

204
00:10:30,837 --> 00:10:32,907
Susan would be very proud
of what you're doing.

205
00:10:33,077 --> 00:10:34,430
Thank you.

206
00:10:36,117 --> 00:10:39,154
And they made it their sign because
Van Buren, our eighth president...

207
00:10:39,317 --> 00:10:41,148
...was the man they most admired.

208
00:10:42,717 --> 00:10:46,505
Kramer, my friend,
that is one ripping good yarn.

209
00:10:48,757 --> 00:10:51,476
You know, if you liked that one,
l got more.

210
00:10:52,237 --> 00:10:53,386
What are you looking for?

211
00:10:53,557 --> 00:10:56,230
Romance? Comedy? Adventure?

212
00:10:56,397 --> 00:10:58,194
Erotica?

213
00:10:58,837 --> 00:11:00,031
No, Kramer, l don't think--

214
00:11:00,197 --> 00:11:03,030
How much would you take
for the whole lot?

215
00:11:04,637 --> 00:11:07,105
-My whole life?
-Name your price, man.

216
00:11:08,117 --> 00:11:09,311
$1 500.

217
00:11:10,317 --> 00:11:12,706
-l'll give you half that.
-Done.

218
00:11:12,877 --> 00:11:15,311
Kramer, my friend, you consider
Elaine at your disposal.

219
00:11:15,917 --> 00:11:17,555
Okay.

220
00:11:17,717 --> 00:11:18,945
Well, l....

221
00:11:19,117 --> 00:11:21,551
l like to work in the evenings.

222
00:11:28,997 --> 00:11:32,353
Would you please just get on
with the stupid Bob Sacamano story?

223
00:11:32,517 --> 00:11:35,554
Well, l'm on the phone with Bob,
and l realize right then and there...

224
00:11:35,717 --> 00:11:39,551
...that l need to return this pair
of pants. So l'm off to the store.

225
00:11:39,717 --> 00:11:41,275
What happened to Bob Sacamano?

226
00:11:41,437 --> 00:11:43,905
Well, nothing. His part
of the story is done.

227
00:11:46,237 --> 00:11:48,114
l'm waiting for the subway.
lt's not coming.

228
00:11:48,277 --> 00:11:50,029
l decided to hoof it
through the tunnel.

229
00:11:50,197 --> 00:11:51,550
Well, now, that's something.

230
00:11:51,717 --> 00:11:53,628
l don't know
if l lost track of time or what.

231
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:56,231
-The next thing l knew--
-A train is bearing down on you?

232
00:11:56,397 --> 00:11:58,627
No, l slipped and fell in mud...

233
00:11:58,797 --> 00:12:02,836
...ruining the very pants
l was about to return.

234
00:12:04,597 --> 00:12:06,349
l don't understand.

235
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:09,634
You were wearing the pants
you were returning?

236
00:12:10,277 --> 00:12:12,233
Well, l guess l was.

237
00:12:12,837 --> 00:12:15,556
What were you gonna
wear on the way back?

238
00:12:15,917 --> 00:12:17,635
Elaine, are you listening?

239
00:12:17,797 --> 00:12:20,072
l didn't even get there.

240
00:12:22,517 --> 00:12:25,236
-All right. Next story.
-l think l've got enough for one day.

241
00:12:25,397 --> 00:12:27,115
-Yeah, chew on that.
-l'll chew on that.

242
00:12:27,277 --> 00:12:30,269
Hey, listen. By the way, l'm hosting
a little get-together tonight...

243
00:12:30,437 --> 00:12:32,553
...in honour of my little
financial upturn.

244
00:12:32,717 --> 00:12:34,628
Oh, thanks, l've got plans.

245
00:12:34,797 --> 00:12:37,072
Yeah, Elaine, you should be there
to document it.

246
00:12:37,237 --> 00:12:40,991
Oh, you're getting together with
some of your jackass friends?

247
00:12:41,157 --> 00:12:43,591
-You want me to take notes?
-Yeah, but get there after 9.

248
00:12:43,757 --> 00:12:46,669
You know, give the people
a chance to loosen up.

249
00:12:53,957 --> 00:12:57,074
So you're denying him the scholarship
because he wants to be a planner?

250
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:58,596
l was betrayed.

251
00:12:59,837 --> 00:13:01,907
That kid was like a son to me.

252
00:13:02,077 --> 00:13:04,466
lf there's one person
you should be able to hold down...

253
00:13:04,637 --> 00:13:06,355
...it's your own flesh and blood.

254
00:13:06,517 --> 00:13:09,554
Like my father
and my father's father before him.

255
00:13:10,117 --> 00:13:12,836
You know, maybe philanthropy
is not your field.

256
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:17,112
Hello. Oh, hi, Ellen.
Yeah, l called the hotel.

257
00:13:17,277 --> 00:13:19,916
-We're set for the weekend.
-Spending the weekend with Ellen?

258
00:13:20,077 --> 00:13:22,068
Vermont.

259
00:13:22,237 --> 00:13:24,876
You know, we can stay
an extra couple of days if we want.

260
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:27,631
Four days at a beautiful
bed-and-breakfast.

261
00:13:27,797 --> 00:13:29,116
l can't wait.

262
00:13:29,277 --> 00:13:30,949
Bye-bye.

263
00:13:35,637 --> 00:13:36,911
What?

264
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:39,355
What is this?

265
00:13:42,237 --> 00:13:44,751
-You wanna start?
-No, no, no. You go ahead.

266
00:13:44,917 --> 00:13:46,953
l gotta get my thoughts together.

267
00:13:48,317 --> 00:13:52,629
Jerry, this whole Ellen situation
has gone far enough.

268
00:13:52,797 --> 00:13:54,947
-What?
-Jerry, she's a loser.

269
00:13:56,677 --> 00:13:58,827
Where is this coming from?
She's great.

270
00:13:58,997 --> 00:14:01,033
Why are you doing this, Jerry?

271
00:14:01,197 --> 00:14:04,189
ls it your career?
Things are gonna pick up.

272
00:14:04,597 --> 00:14:06,747
There's nothing wrong
with my career.

273
00:14:06,917 --> 00:14:09,670
l like the Bloomingdale's
executive training program for him.

274
00:14:09,837 --> 00:14:11,316
We weren't gonna
discuss that now.

275
00:14:11,477 --> 00:14:14,275
-lt's something he should consider.
-Of course he should.

276
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:17,395
-But now is not the time.
-Listen, these issues are interrelated.

277
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:20,117
All right. Excuse me.

278
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:21,790
l'm not buying
any of this.

279
00:14:21,957 --> 00:14:24,949
So, what are you saying? That we're
wrong? Everybody's wrong but you.

280
00:14:25,117 --> 00:14:27,677
This is like that Twilight Zone
where the guy wakes up...

281
00:14:27,837 --> 00:14:30,226
...and he's the same,
and everybody else is different.

282
00:14:30,397 --> 00:14:33,230
-Which one?
-They were all like that.

283
00:14:38,637 --> 00:14:40,912
Why did you take away
my scholarship, Mr. Costanza?

284
00:14:41,117 --> 00:14:42,630
Well, Steven, l....

285
00:14:46,997 --> 00:14:48,430
These are my new friends...

286
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:49,916
...the Van Buren Boys.

287
00:14:50,077 --> 00:14:53,228
He became so disillusioned,
he had to join us.

288
00:14:54,597 --> 00:14:56,315
-Nice.
-l want my scholarship back...

289
00:14:56,477 --> 00:14:58,035
...so l can be a city planner.

290
00:14:58,517 --> 00:15:00,109
What about architect, Steven?

291
00:15:01,717 --> 00:15:04,106
City planner.

292
00:15:09,077 --> 00:15:10,988
-Great party, K-Man.
-You got that straight.

293
00:15:11,157 --> 00:15:15,753
Elaine, try the beef, because that's
real au jus sauce. Real au jus sauce.

294
00:15:15,917 --> 00:15:18,226
-l'll make a note of it.
-Hey, Kramer.

295
00:15:18,397 --> 00:15:20,592
-Yeah.
-Ramirez has never heard your story.

296
00:15:20,757 --> 00:15:21,985
Oh, okay.

297
00:15:22,157 --> 00:15:23,909
Well, l had Bob Sacamano
on the phone...

298
00:15:24,077 --> 00:15:26,671
-...and l suddenly realized that l--
-Hey, Kramer, Kramer.

299
00:15:26,837 --> 00:15:28,555
You can't tell that story now.

300
00:15:28,717 --> 00:15:29,945
lt belongs to Peterman.

301
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,474
-What do you mean?
-You signed the release.

302
00:15:32,677 --> 00:15:35,316
-Yeah.
-He sat in mud, not you.

303
00:15:37,317 --> 00:15:39,626
-But l did sit in mud.
-You didn't.

304
00:15:39,797 --> 00:15:41,310
You never sat in mud.

305
00:15:41,477 --> 00:15:43,149
l was all dirty.

306
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:47,155
-lt never happened, you understand?
-Come on.

307
00:15:47,317 --> 00:15:49,069
-Hey, all right. Yeah.
-Finish the story?

308
00:15:49,237 --> 00:15:52,309
Oh, yeah, well, l--
Yeah, the pants-- They--

309
00:15:52,477 --> 00:15:57,073
They-- They fit well and so l decided
l wasn't gonna return them.

310
00:16:00,997 --> 00:16:02,908
-Getting late. We better get going.
-Okay.

311
00:16:03,077 --> 00:16:04,590
You're gonna go now?

312
00:16:05,477 --> 00:16:07,115
Hey, whoa. Come--

313
00:16:07,277 --> 00:16:09,029
l don't--

314
00:16:09,197 --> 00:16:12,826
Kramer, Kramer, l got big trouble
with the Van Buren Boys.

315
00:16:12,997 --> 00:16:14,908
-They're tough cookies.
-l heard that you...

316
00:16:15,077 --> 00:16:16,908
...got on their good side.
What did you do?

317
00:16:18,597 --> 00:16:20,269
Oh, nothing, nothing.

318
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:24,555
No, l certainly don't have any stories
if that's what you're implying.

319
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,355
You know what those guys
are gonna do?

320
00:16:26,757 --> 00:16:28,668
Yeah, well, you didn't hear it
from me...

321
00:16:28,837 --> 00:16:33,069
...but the Van Buren Boys,
they never hassle their own kind.

322
00:16:33,237 --> 00:16:34,636
You mean, like a former member?

323
00:16:40,637 --> 00:16:43,788
These Kramer stories are unusable.

324
00:16:44,117 --> 00:16:46,995
l mean, some of them
aren't even stories.

325
00:16:47,317 --> 00:16:50,514
Look, this is the list
of things in his apartment.

326
00:16:52,157 --> 00:16:54,432
ls my toaster oven on there?

327
00:16:55,717 --> 00:16:58,629
How am l ever gonna
turn this into a book?

328
00:16:58,797 --> 00:17:01,186
Well, just shape them, change them.
You're a writer.

329
00:17:02,317 --> 00:17:04,308
Yes...

330
00:17:04,477 --> 00:17:06,388
...l'm a writer.

331
00:17:06,557 --> 00:17:07,956
Make them interesting.

332
00:17:08,437 --> 00:17:09,870
lnteresting.

333
00:17:10,157 --> 00:17:11,556
Of course.

334
00:17:11,717 --> 00:17:14,914
People love interesting writing.

335
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:19,876
Well, l gotta go to the airport.
l'm picking up my parents.

336
00:17:20,037 --> 00:17:21,390
What? Weren't they just here?

337
00:17:21,557 --> 00:17:23,787
Yeah, l'm flying them in
to meet Ellen.

338
00:17:23,957 --> 00:17:25,276
l don't know where to turn.

339
00:17:25,437 --> 00:17:28,429
-l gotta see what they think of her.
-Maybe we can have dinner later.

340
00:17:28,597 --> 00:17:32,033
l don't think so. l'm gonna try
to get them to fly right back tonight.

341
00:17:32,397 --> 00:17:34,991
Oh, hey. Hey, have l told you
about my bunions?

342
00:17:35,157 --> 00:17:36,590
You're going to love
this story.

343
00:17:36,757 --> 00:17:39,317
So l line up my cold cuts
on the couch next to me...

344
00:17:39,477 --> 00:17:42,435
...but as l'm stacking them up
they keep falling into my footbath.

345
00:17:42,637 --> 00:17:44,275
Kramer, this is awful.

346
00:17:44,437 --> 00:17:45,870
We don't wanna hear about this.

347
00:17:46,397 --> 00:17:48,752
-Damn.
-What?

348
00:17:48,917 --> 00:17:51,147
Oh, l bought a bunch
of bunion stories from Newman.

349
00:17:51,317 --> 00:17:53,148
But they all stink.

350
00:17:53,317 --> 00:17:55,751
-How much did you pay for them?
-Eight bucks.

351
00:17:55,917 --> 00:17:57,589
l think l'm getting ripped off.

352
00:17:59,077 --> 00:18:00,715
Newman!

353
00:18:03,037 --> 00:18:06,188
Well, what didn't you like
about the first chapter?

354
00:18:06,357 --> 00:18:08,188
Well, it started out nicely.

355
00:18:08,357 --> 00:18:10,917
l'm returning some pants...

356
00:18:11,077 --> 00:18:13,796
...a very identifiable problem.

357
00:18:14,197 --> 00:18:16,427
l set off down a train tunnel.

358
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:19,270
Now, that's where the story takes
a most unappealing turn.

359
00:18:19,437 --> 00:18:21,507
Oh, no, no, that's where
it gets interesting.

360
00:18:21,677 --> 00:18:24,589
Don't you see? The train
is bearing down on you...

361
00:18:24,757 --> 00:18:27,146
...you dive into a side tunnel...

362
00:18:27,317 --> 00:18:31,515
...and you run into a whole band
of underground tunnel dwellers.

363
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:34,555
lt just seems so clichéd
and obvious.

364
00:18:34,717 --> 00:18:36,435
lt's not interesting writing.

365
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:40,026
Yeah, yeah, l know.

366
00:18:40,437 --> 00:18:45,352
How about if instead
of diving from the train, you...?

367
00:18:45,877 --> 00:18:50,155
l don't know. You slip
and fall in some mud...

368
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:53,547
...and ruin your pants?

369
00:18:56,917 --> 00:18:59,147
The very pants l was returning.

370
00:19:02,157 --> 00:19:06,435
That's perfect irony.
Elaine, that is interesting writing.

371
00:19:06,997 --> 00:19:10,114
I have a Cosmo Kramer on line four.

372
00:19:11,077 --> 00:19:13,068
-Peterman here.
-Mr. Peterson...

373
00:19:13,237 --> 00:19:14,909
...you gotta sell me
my stories back.

374
00:19:15,077 --> 00:19:18,114
You wanna know something?
l no longer need them.

375
00:19:18,277 --> 00:19:21,314
No, no, no, Mr. Peterman, why
don't we keep them as a reference.

376
00:19:21,477 --> 00:19:22,876
Nonsense.

377
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:26,712
l have Benes' wonderfully
imaginative mind to spin my stories.

378
00:19:26,877 --> 00:19:28,913
You take back your tales,
you vagabond.

379
00:19:29,957 --> 00:19:32,755
There you are, Elaine.
Go forth and create.

380
00:19:33,397 --> 00:19:36,707
And by the way, when you get to that
chapter about romantic escapades...

381
00:19:36,877 --> 00:19:39,232
...feel free to toss yourself
into the mix.

382
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:46,705
Hey, Van B Boys.

383
00:19:46,877 --> 00:19:49,345
So, Mr. Costanza,
did you get my scholarship back?

384
00:19:49,517 --> 00:19:51,667
Now, fellas, fellas, easy.

385
00:19:51,837 --> 00:19:53,793
Wouldn't wanna beat up
on one of your own.

386
00:19:53,957 --> 00:19:55,356
ls that right?

387
00:19:55,517 --> 00:19:58,668
Then why don't you
flash us the sign?

388
00:19:59,877 --> 00:20:01,390
Right.

389
00:20:02,517 --> 00:20:04,189
The sign.

390
00:20:12,677 --> 00:20:13,871
That's not the sign.

391
00:20:14,317 --> 00:20:16,114
lt was when l was banging.

392
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:17,706
All right...

393
00:20:17,877 --> 00:20:19,674
...if you are really one of us...

394
00:20:19,837 --> 00:20:23,466
...let's see you take the wallet
off the next guy who walks by.

395
00:20:24,637 --> 00:20:26,036
Love to.

396
00:20:29,397 --> 00:20:32,116
And after college l got my
master's at the Sorbonne.

397
00:20:32,277 --> 00:20:35,872
Sorbonne.
Oh, hey, that's in Paris.

398
00:20:36,037 --> 00:20:37,948
Jerry, your parking meter
is about to expire.

399
00:20:38,117 --> 00:20:39,789
Don't get up.
l've got change.

400
00:20:43,797 --> 00:20:46,834
-So, what do you think?
-Jerry, she is fantastic.

401
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:49,067
l knew it. l'm not crazy.

402
00:20:49,237 --> 00:20:50,431
She's so sweet.

403
00:20:50,597 --> 00:20:52,349
And she's got some body on her.

404
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:54,985
And smart, like a computer.

405
00:20:56,917 --> 00:20:59,954
And so much personality.
But it doesn't matter what we think.

406
00:21:00,117 --> 00:21:01,345
Do you like her?

407
00:21:03,077 --> 00:21:05,432
Now l'm not so sure.

408
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:09,306
She's 1 0 times better than that
awful Amber girl that you were with.

409
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:13,072
Yeah, Amber.
l wonder if she's back from Vegas.

410
00:21:17,197 --> 00:21:18,516
All right, no more stalling.

411
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:21,066
Next one or you're meat.

412
00:21:21,237 --> 00:21:22,716
All right. All right.

413
00:21:25,797 --> 00:21:28,265
-Seinfelds.
-Hey, George.

414
00:21:28,437 --> 00:21:29,586
You gotta do me a favour.

415
00:21:29,757 --> 00:21:31,987
Give me your wallet.
l'll give it back to you later.

416
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:33,351
How are your folks?

417
00:21:33,517 --> 00:21:35,872
Trying to pick out a new couch.
You don't wanna know.

418
00:21:36,037 --> 00:21:39,996
Give me your wallet or l'll spill
your guts right here on the street.

419
00:21:40,157 --> 00:21:41,715
What did you say?

420
00:21:41,877 --> 00:21:43,356
Come on, hurry up, old man.

421
00:21:43,517 --> 00:21:44,836
l'm an animal.

422
00:21:44,997 --> 00:21:46,908
You're being very rude.
Come on, Morty.

423
00:21:47,077 --> 00:21:49,466
-Please, they're gonna hit me.
-What?

424
00:21:49,637 --> 00:21:53,346
George Costanza,
what is the matter with you?

425
00:21:53,517 --> 00:21:55,633
Tell your parents we said hi.
