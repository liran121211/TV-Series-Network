1
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,618
I've always wondered why baseball
is so associated with sex.

2
00:00:06,786 --> 00:00:10,062
"He's playing the field. He scored.
He didn't get to first base."

3
00:00:10,226 --> 00:00:11,898
"I struck out." "Why?"
"She wanted a diamond."

4
00:00:12,066 --> 00:00:15,854
It's always baseball.
Always baseball.

5
00:00:16,026 --> 00:00:19,462
As far as baseball goes,
I prefer the fat umpires.

6
00:00:19,626 --> 00:00:21,662
If you're on the field
and not in the game...

7
00:00:21,826 --> 00:00:25,296
...you should be in the worst physical
condition a human could be in.

8
00:00:25,466 --> 00:00:28,697
They should be allowed
to eat during the game.

9
00:00:29,706 --> 00:00:32,698
We're too into sports in this country.
We gotta throttle back.

10
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,458
People come home
from these games:

11
00:00:34,626 --> 00:00:38,016
"We won, we won!"
No, they won, you watched.

12
00:00:43,066 --> 00:00:47,298
Okay, Danny. Take a swing.
No, no, no.

13
00:00:47,466 --> 00:00:49,661
- You're opening up your shoulder.
- Really?

14
00:00:49,826 --> 00:00:53,705
No, not really. I'm just saying this to
you because I like to hear myself talk.

15
00:00:53,866 --> 00:00:55,424
Yes, really.

16
00:00:55,586 --> 00:00:57,178
All right, all right.

17
00:00:57,346 --> 00:01:00,144
- What are you all sweating for?
- It's hot in this uniform.

18
00:01:00,626 --> 00:01:04,221
- Hot? What is this?
- What is what?

19
00:01:04,386 --> 00:01:06,183
This uniform. What's it made from?

20
00:01:06,346 --> 00:01:08,223
- I don't know. Cotton?
- No. No, no.

21
00:01:08,386 --> 00:01:10,104
This is not cotton. Here, let me see.

22
00:01:10,266 --> 00:01:12,257
- What are you doing?
- I wanna see the label.

23
00:01:12,426 --> 00:01:14,303
Will you stop it? Come on.

24
00:01:15,346 --> 00:01:18,861
- Oh, of course. Polyester!
- So?

25
00:01:19,026 --> 00:01:21,824
- I can't believe you're not in cotton.
- This is what they give us.

26
00:01:21,986 --> 00:01:24,705
You know they used to make
leisure suits out of this fabric?

27
00:01:24,866 --> 00:01:27,175
- You really think cotton is better?
- Of course.

28
00:01:27,346 --> 00:01:29,337
All right, maybe I'll say
something to Buck.

29
00:01:30,266 --> 00:01:32,985
- Yeah, good idea. Catch you later.
- Yeah.

30
00:01:33,146 --> 00:01:34,659
Hey, don't embarrass me today.

31
00:01:34,826 --> 00:01:37,181
I got some friends in the stands.

32
00:01:42,346 --> 00:01:44,860
- Hot dogs here. Yankee franks.
- Oh, you want one?

33
00:01:45,026 --> 00:01:46,220
- Yeah.
- I'll get it.

34
00:01:46,386 --> 00:01:47,580
- I got it.
- Jerry.

35
00:01:47,746 --> 00:01:50,021
- Elaine, stop it.
- Just because I'm not working...

36
00:01:50,186 --> 00:01:52,939
...doesn't mean I don't have
any money. Yo. Dogs. Two.

37
00:01:53,106 --> 00:01:54,619
All right. I'm sorry.

38
00:01:54,786 --> 00:01:57,254
Your attention, please.
The New York Yank ees...

39
00:01:57,426 --> 00:02:00,577
...would lik e to welcome
Miss Connecticut...

40
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:04,375
...Miss Rhode Island
and Miss North Dak ota.

41
00:02:04,546 --> 00:02:08,539
Al of whom wil be competing
in the Miss America pageant...

42
00:02:08,706 --> 00:02:12,699
...this week end in Atlantic City.

43
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:15,938
Now, there's a career path
you may have overlooked.

44
00:02:16,106 --> 00:02:19,098
I gotta check my machine. I'm
waiting to hear about an interview.

45
00:02:19,266 --> 00:02:23,259
Doubleday is looking for somebody
to replace Jackie Onassis.

46
00:02:23,426 --> 00:02:25,735
- She worked at Doubleday?
- Yeah, she was an editor.

47
00:02:25,906 --> 00:02:27,578
- Oh, right, just like you.
- Yeah.

48
00:02:27,746 --> 00:02:29,225
- Would you move your feet?
- Yeah.

49
00:02:29,386 --> 00:02:32,583
- Hey, lady!
- Hey, down in front!

50
00:02:32,746 --> 00:02:35,419
- Hey!
- Move your feet.

51
00:02:35,946 --> 00:02:38,585
- I'm going.
- Come on.

52
00:02:40,866 --> 00:02:42,936
- Hot dog?
- No, thanks.

53
00:02:43,106 --> 00:02:46,223
- I'm watching my weight.
- I'm watching my height.

54
00:02:46,386 --> 00:02:48,980
My doctor doesn't want me
to get any taller.

55
00:02:50,386 --> 00:02:53,264
- So you're Miss...?
- Rhode Island.

56
00:02:53,426 --> 00:02:57,135
I was almost Mr. Coffee.
They felt I was a little too relaxed.

57
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:00,620
Miss Rhode Island?

58
00:03:01,146 --> 00:03:03,660
- When are you seeing her?
- Tonight. I have to call her.

59
00:03:03,826 --> 00:03:05,259
She's staying in a hotel.

60
00:03:05,426 --> 00:03:07,257
- You're incredible.
- And get this:

61
00:03:07,426 --> 00:03:09,257
I'm working Atlantic City
this weekend.

62
00:03:09,426 --> 00:03:11,178
She's gonna be there
for the pageant.

63
00:03:11,346 --> 00:03:15,339
What if she becomes Miss America?
You could be dating Miss America.

64
00:03:15,506 --> 00:03:18,100
The only bad thing is we have
to go out with a chaperone.

65
00:03:18,266 --> 00:03:20,177
Chaperone? What, are you kidding?

66
00:03:20,346 --> 00:03:22,906
- No. It's contest rules.
- What does the chaperone do?

67
00:03:23,066 --> 00:03:25,421
I don't know. She just sits there.

68
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:30,500
- Can she talk?
- I'm not sure if she's allowed to talk.

69
00:03:31,106 --> 00:03:33,222
- Are you calling her?
- Yeah.

70
00:03:37,106 --> 00:03:39,700
Yes. Room 417, please.
Karen Hanson.

71
00:03:39,866 --> 00:03:42,938
Hey, did you know the Yankees
don't wear cotton jerseys?

72
00:03:43,106 --> 00:03:44,664
Of course. They're polyester.

73
00:03:44,826 --> 00:03:47,499
Well, what is that? That's a crime.

74
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:50,658
You know how hot those things get?
They should be wearing cotton.

75
00:03:50,826 --> 00:03:52,942
- Why do they wear polyester?
- I don't know.

76
00:03:53,106 --> 00:03:54,585
That's all gonna change.

77
00:03:56,266 --> 00:03:58,905
- You're gonna do something about it?
- Why shouldn't I?

78
00:04:00,266 --> 00:04:02,063
No reason.

79
00:04:05,506 --> 00:04:08,862
Of course, Jackie O
was a great lady.

80
00:04:09,026 --> 00:04:11,938
Those are gonna be
some tough shoes to fill.

81
00:04:12,106 --> 00:04:14,301
Everyone loved her.

82
00:04:14,466 --> 00:04:16,104
She had such...

83
00:04:16,266 --> 00:04:19,019
- ... grace.
- Yes!

84
00:04:20,946 --> 00:04:23,904
- Grace!
- Not many people have grace.

85
00:04:24,706 --> 00:04:27,220
Well, you know,
grace is a tough one.

86
00:04:27,386 --> 00:04:29,377
I like to think I have a little grace.

87
00:04:29,546 --> 00:04:32,663
- Not as much as Jackie O, but-
- You can't have a little grace.

88
00:04:32,826 --> 00:04:36,705
You either have grace
or you don't.

89
00:04:38,346 --> 00:04:41,577
Okay, fine. I have no grace.

90
00:04:42,786 --> 00:04:44,856
And you can't acquire grace.

91
00:04:45,026 --> 00:04:48,382
Well, I have no intention
of getting grace.

92
00:04:48,546 --> 00:04:51,663
Grace isn't something
you can pick up at the market.

93
00:04:51,826 --> 00:04:55,705
All right, look. I don't have grace,
I don't want grace...

94
00:04:55,866 --> 00:04:58,300
...I don't even say grace, okay?

95
00:05:01,026 --> 00:05:03,699
- Thank you for coming in.
- Yeah, yeah, right.

96
00:05:05,506 --> 00:05:09,465
We'll make our choice in a few days
and we'll let you know.

97
00:05:09,626 --> 00:05:12,379
- I have no chance, do I?
- No.

98
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:14,184
All right. Thanks.

99
00:05:14,346 --> 00:05:16,098
Justin Pitt to see you.

100
00:05:16,266 --> 00:05:19,099
- Justin Pitt?
- He was a very close friend...

101
00:05:19,266 --> 00:05:20,540
...of Mrs. Onassis'.

102
00:05:20,706 --> 00:05:23,425
Mrs. Onassis'.
That's hard to pronounce.

103
00:05:23,586 --> 00:05:26,225
- Excuse me?
- Nothing, nothing.

104
00:05:26,386 --> 00:05:29,264
Mrs. Landis, there's something
wrong with this copying machine.

105
00:05:29,426 --> 00:05:30,939
It's all coming out slanted.

106
00:05:31,106 --> 00:05:34,621
Now, I don't know if this
is your department or not.

107
00:05:34,786 --> 00:05:37,983
Justin Pitt, this is Elaine Benes.

108
00:05:44,306 --> 00:05:45,819
Charmed.

109
00:05:46,466 --> 00:05:51,256
I was a great admirer
of Mrs. Onassis.

110
00:05:53,506 --> 00:05:56,703
Hello, Karen?
Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld.

111
00:05:56,866 --> 00:05:58,538
Oh, that's very sweet of you.

112
00:05:58,706 --> 00:06:01,300
You better be careful.
You don't wanna get too congenial.

113
00:06:01,466 --> 00:06:03,582
They'll slap that
Miss Congeniality on you...

114
00:06:03,746 --> 00:06:07,022
...you'll congenial yourself
right out of the contest.

115
00:06:08,626 --> 00:06:11,299
So, what time
you wanna get together later?

116
00:06:11,706 --> 00:06:13,025
What?

117
00:06:13,186 --> 00:06:14,938
So what?
We don't need the chaperone.

118
00:06:15,106 --> 00:06:16,380
Her chaperone can't make it.

119
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:20,499
Oh, you're not
gonna get disqualified.

120
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,577
So we're not going?

121
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,582
Come on.
Hold on one second.

122
00:06:25,746 --> 00:06:27,976
- Hey, what are you doing tonight?
- Nothing.

123
00:06:28,866 --> 00:06:31,585
I'm going out with a Miss America
contestant. You wanna go?

124
00:06:31,746 --> 00:06:33,816
What state?

125
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:38,420
Rhode Island.

126
00:06:38,586 --> 00:06:40,304
They're never in contention.

127
00:06:41,506 --> 00:06:42,780
How do you know?

128
00:06:42,946 --> 00:06:45,824
Because I've seen every
Miss America pageant since I was 6.

129
00:06:45,986 --> 00:06:47,977
Do you wanna go or not?
I'll buy you dinner.

130
00:06:48,146 --> 00:06:50,706
- Giddyup.
- I think I got someone.

131
00:06:56,626 --> 00:06:59,345
The resemblance is uncanny.

132
00:07:02,546 --> 00:07:03,979
Even the brown eyes.

133
00:07:04,146 --> 00:07:06,865
Well, a lot of people
have brown eyes.

134
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:11,622
No, there's something else.
An indefinable quality.

135
00:07:12,026 --> 00:07:13,823
Grace?

136
00:07:14,306 --> 00:07:15,580
Grace, yes.

137
00:07:16,466 --> 00:07:18,696
You think I have grace?

138
00:07:19,266 --> 00:07:22,099
- Some grace, yes.
- Just some?

139
00:07:22,266 --> 00:07:25,064
You don't want too much grace,
or you won't be able to stand.

140
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:30,777
Oh, Mr. Pitt.

141
00:07:31,906 --> 00:07:36,297
Elaine, I want you to come and work
for me as my personal assistant.

142
00:07:36,466 --> 00:07:38,536
Now, I'll pay you the same
as Pendant...

143
00:07:38,706 --> 00:07:41,504
...but I would need you
to start right away.

144
00:07:45,626 --> 00:07:48,015
Hey, Buck.
Talk to you for a second?

145
00:07:48,186 --> 00:07:50,142
Sure, George.

146
00:07:50,306 --> 00:07:52,183
How's everything going?
Everything okay?

147
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:55,656
Well, all of a sudden, there's a
problem with Tartabull's swing, but...

148
00:07:57,986 --> 00:08:00,625
Listen, Buck, obviously
I don't need to talk to you...

149
00:08:00,786 --> 00:08:04,142
...about the importance
of player morale.

150
00:08:04,306 --> 00:08:06,297
But I've been talking
to some of the guys...

151
00:08:06,466 --> 00:08:09,902
...I don't wanna mention any names,
but some of them aren't too happy...

152
00:08:10,066 --> 00:08:12,341
...with the polyester uniforms.

153
00:08:12,506 --> 00:08:15,862
- How so?
- They get very hot in the polyester.

154
00:08:16,026 --> 00:08:18,256
It's not a natural fibre.

155
00:08:18,426 --> 00:08:20,815
I think they would prefer cotton.

156
00:08:21,826 --> 00:08:24,545
- Cotton, huh?
- Cotton breathes.

157
00:08:24,706 --> 00:08:26,697
See, it's much softer.

158
00:08:26,866 --> 00:08:28,140
Imagine playing games...

159
00:08:28,306 --> 00:08:30,695
...and your team is 5 degrees cooler
than the other.

160
00:08:30,866 --> 00:08:32,618
Don't you think that's an advantage?

161
00:08:32,786 --> 00:08:35,505
They're cooler, they're more
comfortable, they're happier...

162
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:36,985
...they're gonna play better.

163
00:08:37,146 --> 00:08:40,775
- You may have something there.
- Oh, I've got something.

164
00:08:41,826 --> 00:08:43,737
Cotton uniforms.

165
00:08:44,826 --> 00:08:46,145
Congratulations.

166
00:08:46,306 --> 00:08:50,219
Yeah. And the best part is I still get
to look for work in publishing.

167
00:08:50,386 --> 00:08:54,299
- Now, what is it that you do, exactly?
- I attend to his personal affairs.

168
00:08:55,026 --> 00:08:56,618
Like what?

169
00:08:57,426 --> 00:09:00,338
Well, like tomorrow,
for example, I...

170
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:04,062
- I have to buy him some socks.
- Really?

171
00:09:04,226 --> 00:09:06,137
- Socks.
- Yeah.

172
00:09:06,306 --> 00:09:08,217
White ones.
Ones you wear with sneakers.

173
00:09:08,386 --> 00:09:10,138
Maybe you could
pick me up underwear.

174
00:09:13,106 --> 00:09:15,666
So, what do you think?
Does this work?

175
00:09:16,226 --> 00:09:18,581
Listen, tonight,
after we finish eating...

176
00:09:18,746 --> 00:09:20,737
...make like you got
something else to do...

177
00:09:20,906 --> 00:09:23,340
...and recede into the night,
if you know what I mean.

178
00:09:23,506 --> 00:09:25,417
No way.

179
00:09:25,746 --> 00:09:28,260
- What?
- If you think I'm gonna step aside...

180
00:09:28,426 --> 00:09:30,621
...while you defile this woman,
you're crazy.

181
00:09:30,786 --> 00:09:32,856
I'm not going to defile her.

182
00:09:33,026 --> 00:09:35,176
Right, because I'm gonna see
it doesn't happen.

183
00:09:35,346 --> 00:09:37,177
These girls are
Miss America contestants.

184
00:09:37,346 --> 00:09:38,779
It's every little girl's dream.

185
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:40,857
I'm not gonna let you
trample that dream...

186
00:09:41,026 --> 00:09:43,460
...and make a mockery
of all the pageant stands for.

187
00:09:43,626 --> 00:09:45,617
No buts.

188
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:47,378
- Those are my rules.
- Wait a minute.

189
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:50,458
If you wanna have some good,
wholesome fun with a nice girl...

190
00:09:50,626 --> 00:09:53,265
...I'll help you.
If you're looking for something more...

191
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,382
- ... you got the wrong guy.
- It's just-

192
00:10:00,786 --> 00:10:02,060
If you were Miss America...

193
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:05,502
...what would you do to make
the world a better place?

194
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,463
As Miss America...

195
00:10:08,626 --> 00:10:12,062
...I would try and bring an end
to world hunger.

196
00:10:12,226 --> 00:10:14,581
If every person sacrificed
one meal a week...

197
00:10:14,746 --> 00:10:17,624
...there would be enough
to feed the whole world.

198
00:10:17,786 --> 00:10:19,663
That's a hell of a plan. Listen-

199
00:10:19,826 --> 00:10:21,782
What advice
would you give young people?

200
00:10:21,946 --> 00:10:23,265
All right, Kramer.

201
00:10:23,426 --> 00:10:26,304
This is important. She must be able
to answer these questions.

202
00:10:26,466 --> 00:10:30,015
She's not gonna have time to think
with millions of people watching her.

203
00:10:30,186 --> 00:10:33,303
Any hesitation could cost her
the crown. You know, poise counts.

204
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,934
- You know a lot about this.
- Yeah, like last year...

205
00:10:36,106 --> 00:10:37,744
...Miss Texas
should have won easily.

206
00:10:37,906 --> 00:10:40,101
But she lost points
in the swimsuit competition.

207
00:10:40,266 --> 00:10:42,700
- What could she have done?
- Tape her breasts together.

208
00:10:46,706 --> 00:10:49,459
- What else?
- All right, take you for example.

209
00:10:49,626 --> 00:10:51,856
You're very attractive,
but you got a big waist.

210
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,904
- Hey, come on!
- No, no, no, it's okay.

211
00:10:55,066 --> 00:10:56,977
- Go on.
- Well...

212
00:10:57,146 --> 00:10:58,898
...I'd recommend a waist cincher.

213
00:10:59,066 --> 00:11:02,297
- Really?
- Oh, yeah. Just... suck you in.

214
00:11:02,466 --> 00:11:05,139
All right. I'll be right back.

215
00:11:07,706 --> 00:11:10,425
- So, what's your talent?
- Magic.

216
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,861
I'm thinking of a number
from one to 10.

217
00:11:13,346 --> 00:11:14,620
Six.

218
00:11:14,786 --> 00:11:16,299
No, five.

219
00:11:16,466 --> 00:11:18,377
But you were close.

220
00:11:19,186 --> 00:11:20,778
And the Yank ees tak e the field.

221
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:24,063
Is it my imagination or the Yank ees
look a little different tonight?

222
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:26,786
- I can't put my finger on it.
- From what I understand...

223
00:11:26,946 --> 00:11:28,584
...they switched to cotton uniforms.

224
00:11:28,746 --> 00:11:30,941
Wel, they say it's softer.

225
00:11:31,106 --> 00:11:33,666
Wel, it is a natural fibre.

226
00:11:35,906 --> 00:11:37,180
How's your eveningwear?

227
00:11:37,866 --> 00:11:40,061
- Well, I'm wearing this red-
- Stop right there.

228
00:11:40,226 --> 00:11:41,500
- No good?
- Disaster.

229
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,702
- Why?
- Well, you got brown eyes.

230
00:11:43,866 --> 00:11:48,337
- You wanna wear a green dress.
- That makes sense.

231
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,861
Well, here we are.

232
00:11:52,026 --> 00:11:57,305
Kramer, would you consider being my
personal consultant for the pageant?

233
00:11:59,106 --> 00:12:01,666
Okay. But if I'm gonna do this...

234
00:12:01,826 --> 00:12:03,976
...we play by my rules
or we don't play at all.

235
00:12:04,146 --> 00:12:06,057
I am in your hands.

236
00:12:08,026 --> 00:12:09,584
Well...

237
00:12:10,706 --> 00:12:12,617
Good night, Jerry.

238
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,941
- Kenneth will take you home.
- Yeah.

239
00:12:26,426 --> 00:12:28,417
Oh, shut the **** up.

240
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:44,339
- Hey.
- Well, if it isn't Mr. Blackwell.

241
00:12:44,506 --> 00:12:45,780
Oh, come on.

242
00:12:45,946 --> 00:12:48,335
And that waist cincher,
that was the topper.

243
00:12:48,506 --> 00:12:53,022
- Oh, you're pooh-poohing?
- Yes, I pooh-pooh.

244
00:12:53,186 --> 00:12:54,744
Well, let me tell you something.

245
00:12:54,906 --> 00:12:57,739
I'm taking this kid to the top.
To the top, Jerry.

246
00:12:57,906 --> 00:13:00,704
We're going for the crown,
and you can't stop her.

247
00:13:00,866 --> 00:13:03,744
- I don't wanna stop her.
- You can't stop her, Jerry!

248
00:13:03,906 --> 00:13:07,455
Oh, I've seen them come and go,
but this kid has got something.

249
00:13:07,626 --> 00:13:08,900
Yeah, so do you.

250
00:13:10,786 --> 00:13:12,663
- Well, did you see it?
- See what?

251
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:15,101
The uniforms!
Did you see how they played?

252
00:13:15,266 --> 00:13:18,736
Listen to these comments.
"Wade Boggs, 'What a fabric.

253
00:13:18,906 --> 00:13:21,056
Finally, we can breathe. '

254
00:13:21,226 --> 00:13:23,786
Luis Polonia, 'Cotton is king. '

255
00:13:23,946 --> 00:13:28,224
Paul O'Neill, 'I never dreamed
anything could be so soft and fluffy."'

256
00:13:29,986 --> 00:13:32,705
- Boy, they really sound comfortable.
- Hey, where you going?

257
00:13:32,866 --> 00:13:34,458
- I'm working Atlantic City.
- Really?

258
00:13:34,626 --> 00:13:36,856
Hey, you're not working.
Why don't you come down.

259
00:13:37,026 --> 00:13:38,823
Atlantic City?

260
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:40,544
Yes. Yes.

261
00:13:40,706 --> 00:13:43,379
I will go to Atlantic City.
I'm in. I'm down.

262
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,817
Maybe Elaine wants to go.
Let me call her.

263
00:13:45,986 --> 00:13:47,897
She's at Mr. Pitt's.
I got the number.

264
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,219
So, what do you think?

265
00:13:53,586 --> 00:13:55,338
- No.
- What-?

266
00:13:55,506 --> 00:13:58,145
- You don't like them?
- No, I don't like them.

267
00:13:59,626 --> 00:14:01,537
- What's wrong?
- They're too tight.

268
00:14:01,706 --> 00:14:03,537
- Too tight?
- There's no elastic.

269
00:14:03,706 --> 00:14:05,981
You need to pull too much.

270
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:07,499
I think they look good.

271
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:10,134
They're cutting off the circulation.

272
00:14:10,306 --> 00:14:12,137
All right. I'll take them back.

273
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:19,735
- Hello?
- Hi, Mr. Pitt. Is Elaine there?

274
00:14:23,386 --> 00:14:25,138
It's for you.

275
00:14:26,586 --> 00:14:28,224
Sorry.

276
00:14:28,386 --> 00:14:30,946
- Hello?
- Hey, Elaine, it's me.

277
00:14:31,106 --> 00:14:33,939
- Jerry.
- Yeah. We're going to Atlantic City.

278
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:38,019
- Really? When?
- Today. Right now. You in?

279
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,776
One second, one second.
Hang on, hang on.

280
00:14:42,386 --> 00:14:47,414
Excuse me, Mr. Pitt. Would it be
all right if I got the socks tomorrow?

281
00:14:48,026 --> 00:14:49,823
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.

282
00:14:49,986 --> 00:14:53,103
I was hoping
for my new socks today.

283
00:14:53,266 --> 00:14:58,340
- Well, it's just one more day.
- I'm sorry. I must have them today.

284
00:15:02,826 --> 00:15:04,703
I can't go.

285
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:09,140
- Why not?
- Because I have to return the socks...

286
00:15:09,306 --> 00:15:12,218
- ... and get different ones.
- Elaine!

287
00:15:12,386 --> 00:15:14,058
I gotta go.

288
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:22,699
No.

289
00:15:23,266 --> 00:15:25,222
All right, watch me.

290
00:15:31,266 --> 00:15:33,496
Turn. Back.

291
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,543
Head up. Shoulders back.

292
00:15:35,706 --> 00:15:39,415
- Posture. See? Posture.
- Yes, I see. Okay.

293
00:15:39,986 --> 00:15:42,864
All right, let's try
a few more questions. All right?

294
00:15:44,346 --> 00:15:47,179
"If you were Miss America
and the U.S. was on the brink...

295
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:50,622
...of a nuclear war and the only way
the conflict could be averted...

296
00:15:50,786 --> 00:15:53,983
...was if you agreed to sleep
with the enemy's leader...

297
00:15:54,466 --> 00:15:55,740
...what would you do?"

298
00:15:55,906 --> 00:15:58,181
Kramer, are these questions
really that important?

299
00:15:58,346 --> 00:15:59,825
Yes, they're important!

300
00:15:59,986 --> 00:16:03,342
If you stumble, if you hesitate,
you can kiss the crown goodbye.

301
00:16:03,506 --> 00:16:07,897
Now, if I told you once, I've told you
a thousand times, poise counts!

302
00:16:08,066 --> 00:16:10,057
It's just as important
as the others.

303
00:16:10,226 --> 00:16:14,822
Swimsuit, eveningwear,
talent, poise!

304
00:16:17,706 --> 00:16:19,981
- Hey. How was the show?
- Good. How was roulette?

305
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:23,741
I won 50 bucks. This is great.
Too bad Elaine's not here.

306
00:16:23,906 --> 00:16:26,784
Yeah. All she had to do
was buy Mr. Pitt a pair of socks.

307
00:16:27,506 --> 00:16:30,066
- It's good, but-
- But what?

308
00:16:30,226 --> 00:16:33,901
- Ultimately, I don't think they'll stay up.
- No. No, they'll stay up.

309
00:16:34,066 --> 00:16:35,977
For a while, yes,
but not in the long run.

310
00:16:36,146 --> 00:16:38,057
But that's why I got you
the tighter ones.

311
00:16:38,226 --> 00:16:40,694
Forget about those!

312
00:16:40,946 --> 00:16:43,744
- Why do you keep mentioning those?
- What do you want?

313
00:16:43,906 --> 00:16:46,136
I want a decent sock
that's comfortable...

314
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:47,898
...that will stay on my foot!

315
00:17:01,786 --> 00:17:05,620
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know. It sounds like pigeons.

316
00:17:06,306 --> 00:17:08,581
- Well, I can't sleep with that noise.
- Me either.

317
00:17:08,746 --> 00:17:11,419
Is there anything you can do
to shut them up?

318
00:17:11,586 --> 00:17:13,497
Wait a second.

319
00:17:14,426 --> 00:17:16,496
This will scare them off.

320
00:17:26,306 --> 00:17:29,457
- Well, good night, Ollie.
- Good night, Stan.

321
00:17:34,746 --> 00:17:37,544
- What is it?
- My doves. They're dead.

322
00:17:37,706 --> 00:17:39,776
I trained those birds for eight years.

323
00:17:39,946 --> 00:17:41,902
How am I supposed to do
my magic act now?

324
00:17:42,066 --> 00:17:44,136
- How did this happen?
- They like it outside...

325
00:17:44,306 --> 00:17:46,342
...so I kept them in a cage
on the terrace...

326
00:17:46,506 --> 00:17:49,145
...then I found them dead
in a pool of water.

327
00:17:52,866 --> 00:17:55,903
- But how did this happen?
- It must have been an accident.

328
00:17:56,066 --> 00:17:57,977
Accident?

329
00:17:59,186 --> 00:18:01,461
This was no accident.

330
00:18:02,146 --> 00:18:04,614
These doves were murdered.

331
00:18:09,986 --> 00:18:13,023
Well, that's it.
She's out of the pageant.

332
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:16,857
- What? Why? What happened?
- Her birds are dead.

333
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,099
- Birds?
- Yeah, birds.

334
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:21,496
She's got trained doves.
She does a magic act.

335
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:24,180
That was her talent for the pageant.

336
00:18:24,346 --> 00:18:27,895
You know what I think, Jerry? I think
somebody murdered those doves.

337
00:18:28,426 --> 00:18:30,462
Somebody wanted her
out of that contest bad.

338
00:18:30,626 --> 00:18:32,901
Somebody who was
just eaten up with jealousy.

339
00:18:33,066 --> 00:18:37,025
Somebody who couldn't stand to have
the spotlight taken off of them.

340
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:41,578
What are you looking at?

341
00:18:44,186 --> 00:18:45,665
Oh, that. We...

342
00:18:45,826 --> 00:18:48,021
We had to leave that outside
last night...

343
00:18:48,186 --> 00:18:51,576
...because the water
was making the room too cold.

344
00:18:53,146 --> 00:18:54,784
That's...

345
00:18:55,346 --> 00:18:57,382
- You killed them.
- No. You don't understand.

346
00:18:57,546 --> 00:18:59,537
It's not what you think.
It was an accident.

347
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:02,618
Don't think that you've won,
you haven't. This kid is a fighter.

348
00:19:02,786 --> 00:19:06,017
And if you think I'm gonna let a couple
of dead birds get in our way...

349
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,904
- ... you're crazy!
- Kramer, you gotta-

350
00:19:11,986 --> 00:19:14,375
What was that all about?

351
00:19:14,546 --> 00:19:17,583
It was Kramer. Apparently I killed
Miss Rhode Island's doves...

352
00:19:17,746 --> 00:19:19,498
...with the bucket of water
last night.

353
00:19:26,786 --> 00:19:28,981
Ladies and gentlemen,
that was Miss Texas.

354
00:19:29,466 --> 00:19:30,945
Wasn't she wonderful?

355
00:19:31,106 --> 00:19:34,542
And now, continuing with
the talent portion of the competition...

356
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:36,776
- Okay, this is it.
- How you feeling?

357
00:19:36,946 --> 00:19:39,665
- I'm a little nervous.
- There's nothing to be nervous about.

358
00:19:39,826 --> 00:19:42,386
But I've never sung
before in my life.

359
00:19:42,946 --> 00:19:46,063
And now, let's welcome
Karen Ann Hanson...

360
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:48,421
...Miss Rhode Island.

361
00:20:14,706 --> 00:20:17,903
I heard those doves
were really incredible.

362
00:20:18,066 --> 00:20:20,057
That's a shame.

363
00:20:25,866 --> 00:20:28,380
It's like watching
an animal get tortured.

364
00:20:30,106 --> 00:20:33,382
- Hey, hey. Yankee game.
- Oh, great. All right.

365
00:20:33,546 --> 00:20:34,979
And the Yank ees tak e the field.

366
00:20:35,146 --> 00:20:38,456
What is with the Yank ees? They look
lik e they're having trouble running.

367
00:20:38,626 --> 00:20:41,379
- They can't move.
- It's their uniforms. They're too tight.

368
00:20:41,546 --> 00:20:44,458
They've shrunk. They're running
lik e penguins. Forget this game.

369
00:20:44,626 --> 00:20:47,902
Oh, my God,
Mattingly just split his pants.

370
00:20:48,946 --> 00:20:51,062
That's a shame.

371
00:20:57,786 --> 00:21:00,141
Poise. Poise.

372
00:21:10,586 --> 00:21:13,817
The Miss America pageant
seems like a really tough contest.

373
00:21:13,986 --> 00:21:17,183
You come out there in the
bathing suit and the dress shoes.

374
00:21:17,346 --> 00:21:19,576
They got that
sanitized-for-your-protection...

375
00:21:19,746 --> 00:21:22,544
...toilet-seat thing hanging off them,
you know?

376
00:21:22,706 --> 00:21:25,539
Plus, they gotta wear
all the other outfits. I don't know why.

377
00:21:25,706 --> 00:21:27,901
The bathing suit is the contest.

378
00:21:28,066 --> 00:21:29,897
You win the bathing suit, you win.

379
00:21:30,066 --> 00:21:33,183
Everybody looks good in formalwear.
It's dark, it covers everything.

380
00:21:33,346 --> 00:21:35,257
That's why we have weddings in it.

381
00:21:35,426 --> 00:21:37,223
If we had weddings
in bathing suits...

382
00:21:37,386 --> 00:21:39,217
...a lot of ceremonies
wouldn't get past:

383
00:21:39,386 --> 00:21:40,705
"If anyone sees any reason...

384
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:43,744
...why these two people
should not be joined together..."

385
00:21:43,906 --> 00:21:46,215
About 80 hands go up.

386
00:21:52,826 --> 00:21:53,815
