1
00:00:02,281 --> 00:00:03,919
Car names are so stupid,
aren't they?

2
00:00:05,521 --> 00:00:07,079
No baron has ever owned
a LeBaron.

3
00:00:07,241 --> 00:00:08,993
Or the Ford LTD.

4
00:00:09,161 --> 00:00:12,233
LTD. Limited.
It's a limited edition.

5
00:00:12,401 --> 00:00:14,961
What did they make,
50 million of those?

6
00:00:15,121 --> 00:00:18,477
Yes, it's limited
to the number we can sell.

7
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:22,511
Or when they try and mangle
a positive word into a car name.

8
00:00:22,681 --> 00:00:25,434
You know how they'll do that?
The Integra.

9
00:00:25,601 --> 00:00:28,877
Oh, integrity? No, Integra.

10
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:32,351
The Supra or the lmpreza. Yeah?

11
00:00:32,521 --> 00:00:35,115
Well, I hope it's not a "lemona."

12
00:00:35,281 --> 00:00:38,478
Or you'll be hearing
from my "lawya."

13
00:00:42,401 --> 00:00:45,393
So, George, you sure I can't show you
any other cars?

14
00:00:46,281 --> 00:00:49,239
I don't think so, Vic.
Done my homework.

15
00:00:49,401 --> 00:00:51,915
'89 Volvo. That's the car for me.
It's the one I want.

16
00:00:52,121 --> 00:00:56,273
- I got a LeBaron convertible right here.
- N.I., not interested.

17
00:00:56,441 --> 00:01:00,195
Got a few more miles on it,
but the previous owner was Jon Voight.

18
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:03,758
Jon Voight?

19
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:08,434
Okay, Tim, you're welcome.

20
00:01:09,681 --> 00:01:12,036
- Was that Tim Whatley?
- Yes, it was.

21
00:01:12,201 --> 00:01:13,475
He wanted your address.

22
00:01:13,641 --> 00:01:16,951
You, friend, will be invited to
his night-before- Thanksgiving party.

23
00:01:17,721 --> 00:01:19,837
He's got that great apartment
on 77th Street...

24
00:01:20,001 --> 00:01:22,834
...and they overlook where they inflate
those huge balloons...

25
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:24,912
...for the Macy's
Thanksgiving Day Parade.

26
00:01:25,081 --> 00:01:29,632
I have always had a big crush on Tim.
Why can't he ask me out?

27
00:01:29,801 --> 00:01:32,235
He's a dentist. You don't wanna go out
with a dentist.

28
00:01:32,401 --> 00:01:34,039
- Why?
- He'll always be criticising...

29
00:01:34,201 --> 00:01:36,761
...your brushing technique.
It'll drive you crazy.

30
00:01:36,921 --> 00:01:39,151
Away from the gums.

31
00:01:40,841 --> 00:01:42,593
New car!

32
00:01:42,881 --> 00:01:44,360
Hey!

33
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:45,954
Did you get the Volvo?

34
00:01:46,121 --> 00:01:49,909
No, I decided to go
with an '89 LeBaron.

35
00:01:51,601 --> 00:01:53,034
A LeBaron?

36
00:01:53,201 --> 00:01:55,510
I thought Consumer
said Volvo was the car.

37
00:01:55,681 --> 00:01:58,036
What consumer? I'm the consumer.

38
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:03,280
- Seems like a strange choice.
- Well, maybe so.

39
00:02:03,441 --> 00:02:07,719
But it was good enough
for Mr. Jon Voight.

40
00:02:08,401 --> 00:02:12,030
- Jon Voight? The actor?
- That's right.

41
00:02:12,201 --> 00:02:16,672
He just happened to be
the previous owner of the vehicle.

42
00:02:16,841 --> 00:02:20,629
You bought a car because
it belonged to Jon Voight?

43
00:02:20,801 --> 00:02:22,280
No. No.

44
00:02:22,441 --> 00:02:24,397
I think "yes, yes."

45
00:02:24,601 --> 00:02:28,150
You like the idea of telling people
you're driving Jon Voight's car.

46
00:02:28,761 --> 00:02:30,240
All right, maybe I do. So what?

47
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:34,719
I've never even seen him in a car.
I mean, look at his movies. No cars.

48
00:02:34,881 --> 00:02:37,634
De/iverance, canoe.

49
00:02:37,801 --> 00:02:40,520
Midnight Cowboy, boots.

50
00:02:40,681 --> 00:02:41,955
Runaway Train...

51
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:43,474
...runaway train.

52
00:02:44,521 --> 00:02:48,434
Hey. Jerry, you know that shoe
repair place at the end of the block?

53
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:51,399
If they don't get business,
they'll shut down and make way...

54
00:02:51,561 --> 00:02:54,871
...for one of those gourmet coffee
or cookie stores.

55
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:58,672
- I like coffee.
- I like cookies.

56
00:02:58,841 --> 00:03:00,672
Well, of course you do.
And you know why?

57
00:03:00,841 --> 00:03:02,991
Because you're a bunch of yuppies.

58
00:03:03,161 --> 00:03:05,994
It's your "go, go"
corporate- takeover lifestyles...

59
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:08,470
...that are driving out
these mom-and-pop stores...

60
00:03:08,641 --> 00:03:10,950
...and destroying the fabric
of this neighbourhood.

61
00:03:11,121 --> 00:03:13,510
Well, what's so great about
a mom-and-pop store?

62
00:03:13,681 --> 00:03:17,390
Let me tell you, if my mom and pop
ran a store, I wouldn't shop there.

63
00:03:18,121 --> 00:03:19,395
Hey, Bucambo...

64
00:03:19,561 --> 00:03:21,870
...they've been in the neighbourhood
for 48 years.

65
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:24,032
Now, come on, Jerry,
you gotta have shoes...

66
00:03:24,201 --> 00:03:25,554
...in need of a cobbler.

67
00:03:25,721 --> 00:03:28,918
I really don't wear the kind of shoes
that have to be cobbled.

68
00:03:29,081 --> 00:03:30,355
Well, what about sneakers?

69
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:32,432
They'll clean them.
Do complete detailing.

70
00:03:33,481 --> 00:03:36,120
- All right. Take them.
- Yeah, yeah.

71
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:39,720
Kramer, without you,
we'd be out of business.

72
00:03:39,881 --> 00:03:42,998
These belong to my neighbour,
Jerry Seinfeld, the comedian.

73
00:03:43,161 --> 00:03:46,710
- So many sneakers.
- Well, he's got a Peter Pan complex.

74
00:03:46,881 --> 00:03:48,678
They'll be ready
a week from Thursday.

75
00:03:48,841 --> 00:03:50,194
Oh, well, no rush.

76
00:03:51,841 --> 00:03:54,480
- What's the matter?
- I keep getting these nosebleeds.

77
00:03:54,641 --> 00:03:57,633
- Lie down. And put your head back.
- Oh, yeah.

78
00:04:03,001 --> 00:04:05,720
- Hey, what's with your ceiling?
- What?

79
00:04:05,881 --> 00:04:08,759
You got wires sticking out
every which way.

80
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:11,310
It looks dangerous.
You should call an electrician.

81
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:14,152
You know, in the 48 years
we've been here...

82
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:16,596
...I don't think we've ever called
an electrician.

83
00:04:16,761 --> 00:04:19,719
Well, you should.
This place could blow any minute.

84
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:33,838
- Elaine.
- Yes, Mr. Pitt?

85
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:37,311
Have you gotten all the salt
off those pretzels yet?

86
00:04:37,481 --> 00:04:39,039
No. I'm still working on it.

87
00:04:39,201 --> 00:04:40,793
What in blazes
are you listening to?

88
00:04:40,961 --> 00:04:43,077
Artie Shaw, "Honeysuckle Jump."

89
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,197
That was Artie Shaw,
"Honeysuck/e Jump."

90
00:04:45,361 --> 00:04:47,636
Elaine, how did you know that?

91
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:52,352
Oh, my father used to have
a huge collection of big-band records.

92
00:04:52,521 --> 00:04:54,830
Congratu/ations to Wayne Hopper
for identifying it.

93
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:57,037
By doing so,
he becomes our seventh person...

94
00:04:57,201 --> 00:04:58,839
... to man
the Woody Woodpeck er ba//oon...

95
00:04:59,001 --> 00:05:00,912
... in the Macy's
Thanksgiving Day Parade.

96
00:05:01,081 --> 00:05:02,992
There are on/y three spots /eft.

97
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:05,550
When we come back,
you'// have three more chances...

98
00:05:05,721 --> 00:05:08,360
... to win a spot ho/ding a rope
under Woody Woodpeck er.

99
00:05:08,521 --> 00:05:11,274
Could you identify the next song?
Could you? Could you?

100
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:15,070
Why would you wanna hold the ropes
from the Woody Woodpecker balloon?

101
00:05:15,241 --> 00:05:17,038
My father was a stern man.

102
00:05:17,201 --> 00:05:19,431
He forbade us to participate
in any activities...

103
00:05:19,601 --> 00:05:22,115
...that he thought were associated
with the common man.

104
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:24,749
The Thanksgiving Day Parade
was first on the list.

105
00:05:24,921 --> 00:05:27,594
All right. Okay.
I'll do the best I can.

106
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:30,275
Here we go for the next spot
under the ba//oon.

107
00:05:30,441 --> 00:05:33,513
If you know the name
of this next song, ca// 555-B AND.

108
00:05:38,561 --> 00:05:40,517
Elaine? Do you know it?
What song is it?

109
00:05:40,681 --> 00:05:43,832
- Will you shut up? I can't hear!
- I'm sorry.

110
00:05:44,961 --> 00:05:47,714
Oh, I've got it!
It's "Next Stop, Pottersville."

111
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:49,553
Goody! Yes, yes, yes!

112
00:05:49,721 --> 00:05:52,997
"Next Stop, Pottersville."
You are a genius.

113
00:05:54,761 --> 00:05:57,321
You'll love this car,
even if you don't like Jon Voight.

114
00:05:57,481 --> 00:06:00,041
I like Jon Voight.
It's a strange reason to buy a car...

115
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:01,793
...because he might have driven it.

116
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:03,314
What do you mean, "might"?

117
00:06:03,481 --> 00:06:06,234
- You don't think he really owned it?
- I don't know.

118
00:06:06,401 --> 00:06:08,471
Why would the guy make up
something like that?

119
00:06:08,641 --> 00:06:11,155
Of the names he could pick,
why settle on Jon Voight?

120
00:06:11,321 --> 00:06:13,073
Don't you see,
that's the genius of it.

121
00:06:13,241 --> 00:06:16,597
If he had said Liam Neeson,
you'd know he's making it up.

122
00:06:16,761 --> 00:06:18,717
Liam Neeson?

123
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:22,192
How are you comparing
Liam Neeson with Jon Voight?

124
00:06:22,361 --> 00:06:24,079
Jerry, we're talking about Joe Buck.

125
00:06:24,881 --> 00:06:28,760
If you can play Joe Buck,
Oskar Schindler's a cakewalk.

126
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:30,798
Oh, look at this.
I stepped in gum.

127
00:06:30,961 --> 00:06:33,270
You're not getting in my car
with gummy shoes.

128
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:37,034
All right. I'll change my shoes.

129
00:06:37,801 --> 00:06:39,075
Liam Neeson.

130
00:06:39,241 --> 00:06:40,879
You know he's not American.

131
00:06:42,081 --> 00:06:43,992
Let me get a clean pair.

132
00:06:45,201 --> 00:06:48,432
Everybody's ta/king at me

133
00:06:49,281 --> 00:06:51,920
I can't hear a word they're saying

134
00:06:53,361 --> 00:06:56,034
Just driving round
In Jon Voight's car

135
00:06:57,641 --> 00:06:59,996
Kramer!

136
00:07:03,401 --> 00:07:05,357
Hey, where's all my sneakers?

137
00:07:05,521 --> 00:07:08,274
- You said take them.
- Not all of them.

138
00:07:08,441 --> 00:07:10,796
Well, obviously,
there was a miscommunication.

139
00:07:11,441 --> 00:07:13,636
Obviously.
So, what am I supposed to wear?

140
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:15,837
- Jerry, I left you a pair right here.
- Where?

141
00:07:16,001 --> 00:07:17,400
Come on. You're not looking.

142
00:07:17,561 --> 00:07:20,633
Here. There. Put on those boots.

143
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,033
I can't wear these.

144
00:07:23,241 --> 00:07:25,118
- Well, why not?
- They're uncomfortable.

145
00:07:25,281 --> 00:07:27,317
Come on here. Try them on.

146
00:07:28,401 --> 00:07:29,720
Where did you get those?

147
00:07:29,881 --> 00:07:32,679
I worked a club in Dallas once,
and they couldn't pay me...

148
00:07:32,841 --> 00:07:34,115
...so they gave me these.

149
00:07:36,401 --> 00:07:39,313
I can't wear these.
They look ridiculous.

150
00:07:41,801 --> 00:07:43,712
You look like a cowboy.

151
00:07:44,641 --> 00:07:47,439
I don't wanna be a cowboy.

152
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:49,319
Oh, stop it.

153
00:07:49,481 --> 00:07:50,960
You know Tim the dentist?

154
00:07:51,121 --> 00:07:53,396
I got an invitation to his
Thanksgiving eve party.

155
00:07:53,561 --> 00:07:56,758
- Yeah? I got one too.
- Oh, yeah?

156
00:07:57,761 --> 00:07:59,956
- What?
- No. Nothing.

157
00:08:00,121 --> 00:08:03,955
- No, what is it?
- No, it's just that I didn't get one.

158
00:08:04,121 --> 00:08:05,440
You didn't get one?

159
00:08:05,601 --> 00:08:08,513
But he called me up and asked
for yours and Elaine's addresses.

160
00:08:08,681 --> 00:08:10,160
I'm sure that means I'm invited.

161
00:08:10,321 --> 00:08:12,596
Not necessarily.

162
00:08:12,761 --> 00:08:14,831
Why would you call someone
for addresses...

163
00:08:15,001 --> 00:08:16,753
...if you're not invited to the party?

164
00:08:16,921 --> 00:08:19,560
That's the genius of it.

165
00:08:22,361 --> 00:08:26,354
I'm calling Elaine. See if she can
find out anything from Tim Whatley.

166
00:08:26,521 --> 00:08:29,638
Hey, I got Jon Voight's LeBaron.

167
00:08:30,521 --> 00:08:32,512
Boss.

168
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:38,198
Four thousand dollars!
We can't afford that.

169
00:08:38,361 --> 00:08:40,272
Well, you have to do
something about it...

170
00:08:40,441 --> 00:08:42,750
...because it's in violation
of the building code.

171
00:08:42,921 --> 00:08:44,991
Otherwise,
they're gonna close you up.

172
00:08:46,561 --> 00:08:48,916
Supposing we can't pay for it?

173
00:08:49,081 --> 00:08:52,960
Then I have to report you.
Otherwise, I lose my license.

174
00:08:53,121 --> 00:08:55,157
Sorry.

175
00:08:57,241 --> 00:09:00,756
Forty-eight years, Mom.
And now we have to close.

176
00:09:00,921 --> 00:09:03,879
All because of that idiot
and his bloody nose.

177
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:06,077
Afternoon, Mom. Afternoon, Pop.

178
00:09:06,241 --> 00:09:08,072
You know you got a crack
in the sidewalk?

179
00:09:08,241 --> 00:09:09,515
You ought to get that fixed.

180
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:17,471
- So?
- Come on, put the top up.

181
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:21,031
- It's November.
- I feel alive, Jerry.

182
00:09:21,201 --> 00:09:22,793
Let's check out the glove box.

183
00:09:22,961 --> 00:09:24,440
Pencil.

184
00:09:24,601 --> 00:09:27,069
Hey, you don't think?

185
00:09:27,241 --> 00:09:28,879
Sure. That's Jon Voight's pencil.

186
00:09:29,601 --> 00:09:31,000
With Jon Voight's teeth marks.

187
00:09:33,761 --> 00:09:36,229
Owner's manual.

188
00:09:36,401 --> 00:09:38,596
You know what?
This car was owned by Jon Voight.

189
00:09:38,761 --> 00:09:40,035
You see? I told you.

190
00:09:40,801 --> 00:09:43,599
Except Jon is spelled with an H.

191
00:09:43,761 --> 00:09:46,434
- J-O-H-N.
- So?

192
00:09:46,601 --> 00:09:49,798
Doesn't Jon Voight
spell his name J-O-N?

193
00:09:56,441 --> 00:09:58,318
- So, what are you saying?
- Nothing.

194
00:09:58,481 --> 00:10:01,041
I'm sure Jon probably misspelled
his own name.

195
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:03,954
I know sometimes I spell Jerry
with a G.

196
00:10:04,121 --> 00:10:05,554
And an I.

197
00:10:13,601 --> 00:10:15,796
- Get out of the car!
- What?

198
00:10:15,961 --> 00:10:19,351
That's right, you heard me. Get out.
You're ruining this whole experience.

199
00:10:19,521 --> 00:10:22,240
Oh, look.
There's Gregory Peck's bicycle.

200
00:10:22,401 --> 00:10:25,074
- Get out!
- And Barbara Mandrell's skateboard.

201
00:10:25,241 --> 00:10:27,311
Get out!

202
00:10:31,321 --> 00:10:32,640
Hey, cowboy.

203
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,160
Where's your horse?

204
00:10:37,001 --> 00:10:39,390
Yeah, you better run.

205
00:10:43,881 --> 00:10:45,997
- Did they take anything?
- They didn't touch me.

206
00:10:46,161 --> 00:10:48,516
I tripped because of
these stupid cowboy boots.

207
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:51,912
Well, anyway, again, I'm sorry
about throwing you out of the car.

208
00:10:52,081 --> 00:10:54,515
- You really seemed to enjoy it.
- It was kind of fun.

209
00:10:55,841 --> 00:11:00,153
You know, maybe his name
really is J-O-H-N...

210
00:11:00,321 --> 00:11:02,835
...but he changed it to J-O-N
for show business.

211
00:11:03,201 --> 00:11:06,193
Well, you know, J-O-N
is a lot zippier.

212
00:11:06,681 --> 00:11:08,831
Yeah, that's possible.

213
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,561
How would you find out
something like that?

214
00:11:12,601 --> 00:11:14,273
Wait a minute. What am I thinking?

215
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:17,239
I've got the entire
Yankee organisation at my disposal.

216
00:11:18,361 --> 00:11:21,398
- He'll dispose of it.
- That's right. See you later.

217
00:11:23,161 --> 00:11:26,790
So, Jerome, I did a little
snooping around for you.

218
00:11:26,961 --> 00:11:33,560
- What did you find out, Lois?
- Well, I talked to Tim Whatley.

219
00:11:33,881 --> 00:11:35,155
Yeah?

220
00:11:35,321 --> 00:11:38,119
And I asked him,
"Should Jerry bring anything?"

221
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:40,112
Subtle.

222
00:11:40,281 --> 00:11:43,000
And he said,
"Why would Jerry bring anything?"

223
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:46,358
All right, but let me ask you this.
Which word did he emphasise?

224
00:11:46,521 --> 00:11:49,513
Did he say,
"Why would Jerry bring anything?"

225
00:11:49,681 --> 00:11:52,753
Or, "Why would Jerry
bring anything?"

226
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:56,277
Did he emphasise
"Jerry" or "bring"?

227
00:11:56,481 --> 00:11:59,120
I think he emphasised "would."

228
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:04,157
You know what? The hell with his party.
I don't wanna go to begin with.

229
00:12:04,321 --> 00:12:06,630
- Hey.
- Hey. So where's my sneakers?

230
00:12:06,801 --> 00:12:08,837
- That's what I wanna know.
- What do you mean?

231
00:12:09,001 --> 00:12:10,673
I saw Mom and Pop this morning...

232
00:12:10,841 --> 00:12:13,958
...but when I went by the store
on my way home, the place was empty.

233
00:12:14,121 --> 00:12:18,751
Everything is gone.
Mom and Pop... vanished.

234
00:12:18,921 --> 00:12:21,515
- So all my sneakers are gone?
- I'm afraid so.

235
00:12:21,681 --> 00:12:23,433
And that's just
the tip of the iceberg.

236
00:12:23,601 --> 00:12:26,798
I've been asking around.
They didn't even have any kids.

237
00:12:27,761 --> 00:12:30,673
Mom and Pop
aren't even a mom and pop?

238
00:12:30,841 --> 00:12:32,115
It was all an act, Jerry.

239
00:12:32,281 --> 00:12:34,954
They conned us,
and they scored bigtime.

240
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:40,117
So Mom and Pop's plan
was to move into the neighbourhood...

241
00:12:40,281 --> 00:12:42,954
... establish trust...

242
00:12:43,121 --> 00:12:45,589
...for 48 years...

243
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:50,270
...and then run off
with Jerry's sneakers?

244
00:12:50,481 --> 00:12:52,472
Apparently.

245
00:12:53,561 --> 00:12:55,472
All right. That's enough of this.

246
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:58,155
- Where you going?
- I gotta go to the Dixieland Deli...

247
00:12:58,321 --> 00:13:01,233
...to pick up Mr. Pitt's security pass
for the parade.

248
00:13:01,401 --> 00:13:04,120
Why does he wanna hold a rope
underneath Woody Woodpecker...

249
00:13:04,281 --> 00:13:05,873
...in the Thanksgiving Day Parade?

250
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:09,397
He finds his laugh intoxicating.

251
00:13:11,281 --> 00:13:13,351
So, George, what kind
of promotional events...

252
00:13:13,521 --> 00:13:15,113
...are we talking about?
- Well...

253
00:13:15,281 --> 00:13:18,830
...I think we need more
special days at the stadium.

254
00:13:19,001 --> 00:13:20,275
You know, like...

255
00:13:20,441 --> 00:13:22,750
...Joe Pepitone Day...

256
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,514
...or Jon Voight Day.
- Jon Voight?

257
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:28,637
The actor?

258
00:13:29,681 --> 00:13:32,718
I make a motion that we have
no more of these meetings...

259
00:13:32,881 --> 00:13:36,112
...that have been initiated
by George Costanza.

260
00:13:36,761 --> 00:13:38,911
I suppose if I had suggested
Liam Neeson Day...

261
00:13:39,081 --> 00:13:40,833
...you'd all be patting me
on the back.

262
00:13:42,761 --> 00:13:44,797
I guessed Stan Herman's
"Boomtown Blues."

263
00:13:45,961 --> 00:13:51,081
- What did you guess?
- It was "Next Stop, Pottersville."

264
00:13:51,241 --> 00:13:53,038
Everybody knows that.

265
00:13:53,561 --> 00:13:55,631
You know when
they're giving out the passes?

266
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,120
After the music.

267
00:14:10,801 --> 00:14:12,632
Oh, man.

268
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,680
Taxi! Taxi.

269
00:14:19,881 --> 00:14:21,837
Hey! Jon Voight!

270
00:14:22,001 --> 00:14:24,754
Jon Voight! Hey, listen.

271
00:14:26,201 --> 00:14:28,761
Can I ask you something?
Listen. Do you...? Wait...

272
00:14:37,201 --> 00:14:39,840
- No Jon Voight Day, huh?
- No.

273
00:14:40,001 --> 00:14:42,993
Now I'll always have this doubt
about the car.

274
00:14:43,161 --> 00:14:45,675
- What, your jaw still hurts?
- Yeah, it's all swollen.

275
00:14:45,841 --> 00:14:48,036
I think I chipped a tooth
when I fell yesterday.

276
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:51,115
- Have somebody look at it.
- I'm calling dentists all day.

277
00:14:51,281 --> 00:14:52,999
Nobody works
day before Thanksgiving.

278
00:14:53,161 --> 00:14:55,880
- You going to the party?
- No. I don't know if I'm invited.

279
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:59,078
- There'll be lots of dentists there.
- Yeah, you're right.

280
00:14:59,241 --> 00:15:00,879
You don't wanna suffer all weekend.

281
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:03,475
Yeah, I gotta see a dentist.
This is killing me.

282
00:15:03,641 --> 00:15:06,519
Well, I'll take a chance.
We'll go together.

283
00:15:08,761 --> 00:15:10,672
Maybe I'll just meet you there.

284
00:15:10,841 --> 00:15:12,559
- You don't wanna go with me?
- Jerry...

285
00:15:12,721 --> 00:15:15,679
...for all I know, this guy went
out his way to not invite you.

286
00:15:15,841 --> 00:15:17,672
How am I gonna feel if I show up...

287
00:15:17,841 --> 00:15:19,797
...with an uninvited,
unwelcome intruder?

288
00:15:20,401 --> 00:15:23,234
The way I feel
when I go places with you?

289
00:15:25,561 --> 00:15:27,950
- Hey.
- Hey. Did you find my sneakers yet?

290
00:15:28,121 --> 00:15:30,635
No. But I ran into somebody
you might be interested in.

291
00:15:30,801 --> 00:15:32,757
A Mr. Jon Voight, the actor.

292
00:15:32,961 --> 00:15:35,634
Jon Voight, are you kidding me?
Did you talk to him?

293
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:37,234
He was a little standoffish.

294
00:15:39,201 --> 00:15:40,953
What, you didn't ask him
about the car?

295
00:15:41,121 --> 00:15:44,909
I couldn't. His cab pulled away.
But he did make an impression on me.

296
00:15:45,081 --> 00:15:46,514
- Look.
- What?

297
00:15:46,681 --> 00:15:48,911
His tooth marks. He bit me.

298
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:51,879
- Jon Voight bit you?
- What is he, a vampire?

299
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:54,919
No, it's justifiable.
He thought I was going for his wallet.

300
00:15:55,081 --> 00:15:57,356
- He left perfect imprints.
- That he did.

301
00:15:57,521 --> 00:16:00,433
You've got that pencil
with the bite marks on it?

302
00:16:00,601 --> 00:16:04,355
We get a trained eye to match them,
and we'll see if you're driving his car.

303
00:16:04,521 --> 00:16:06,830
Oh, please.

304
00:16:07,001 --> 00:16:08,912
Wait a minute.
Wait, it's not that stupid.

305
00:16:09,081 --> 00:16:11,151
No, it's stupid.

306
00:16:11,321 --> 00:16:14,040
Why? Why is it impossible?
I mean, they're both bite marks.

307
00:16:14,201 --> 00:16:16,840
You're showing up at that party
with a chewed- up pencil...

308
00:16:17,001 --> 00:16:18,275
...and Kramer's gnarled arm?

309
00:16:19,801 --> 00:16:21,792
- It's worth a shot.
- Yeah.

310
00:16:21,961 --> 00:16:23,872
Kramer, you wanna go
to the party together?

311
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:26,191
Jerry, look, come on,
I'm an invited guest.

312
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:29,478
I can't be aiding and abetting
some party crasher.

313
00:16:42,881 --> 00:16:46,840
Excuse me, dentist? Dentist?

314
00:16:49,401 --> 00:16:51,039
Dentist?

315
00:16:51,201 --> 00:16:53,556
Are you a dentist?

316
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,473
Are you a dentist?

317
00:16:56,241 --> 00:16:58,152
These are the balloons?

318
00:16:58,321 --> 00:17:00,198
Big deal.
All I see is Woody Woodpecker.

319
00:17:01,841 --> 00:17:03,957
You got a problem
with Woody Woodpecker?

320
00:17:04,121 --> 00:17:06,715
Yeah. What is he,
some sort of an instigator?

321
00:17:06,881 --> 00:17:10,112
That's right. He's a troublemaker.

322
00:17:11,961 --> 00:17:13,394
Hey, did you get my message?

323
00:17:13,561 --> 00:17:15,836
What? I can't hear
a word you're saying.

324
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:18,276
I was stuck
at the Dixieland Deli all day.

325
00:17:18,441 --> 00:17:20,875
My head is still ringing.

326
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,394
Where's Tim?

327
00:17:22,561 --> 00:17:24,233
What's that?
Empire State Building?

328
00:17:24,401 --> 00:17:26,278
What? I can't hear you!

329
00:17:28,401 --> 00:17:29,800
Elaine, would you marry me?

330
00:17:31,241 --> 00:17:33,311
Wh...? I told you,
I can't hear a word.

331
00:17:33,481 --> 00:17:35,711
All right. Forget it.

332
00:17:36,281 --> 00:17:39,478
- Hey, Tim, how you doing?
- George. Kramer, how you doing?

333
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:41,279
Watch... Watch the arm.

334
00:17:41,441 --> 00:17:43,955
Listen, we don't wanna bother you.
We know you're busy.

335
00:17:44,121 --> 00:17:46,635
- No, it's okay, what is it?
- Let me show you something.

336
00:17:46,801 --> 00:17:48,393
- Take a look.
- I'm gonna get going.

337
00:17:48,561 --> 00:17:50,995
- Let me take down your number.
- Great.

338
00:17:52,481 --> 00:17:55,075
- Hey, is that Jerry Seinfeld?
- He didn't come with us.

339
00:17:55,281 --> 00:17:57,237
- Tim, the pencil.
- Jerry.

340
00:17:57,401 --> 00:18:00,120
- Hey, Tim.
- Jerry. I didn't think you'd show.

341
00:18:00,681 --> 00:18:03,957
Did you say,
"Jerry, I didn't think you'd show"...

342
00:18:04,121 --> 00:18:06,681
...or, "Jerry,
I didn't think you'd show."

343
00:18:08,121 --> 00:18:11,557
- Elaine, hi.
- Tim.

344
00:18:11,721 --> 00:18:13,279
I'm really glad you came.

345
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:17,192
- What?
- I'm really glad you came.

346
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:23,911
Listen, Elaine,
I've been wanting to ask you...

347
00:18:24,081 --> 00:18:26,993
...would you like to go out with me
New Year's Eve?

348
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,633
Thanks.

349
00:18:32,801 --> 00:18:34,917
What? What?

350
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:36,719
Let me ask you something.

351
00:18:36,881 --> 00:18:39,634
Could you tell if teeth marks
on somebody's arm...

352
00:18:39,801 --> 00:18:41,393
...matched teeth marks on a pencil?

353
00:18:42,081 --> 00:18:44,754
- It's possible.
- Roll up your sleeve.

354
00:18:44,921 --> 00:18:46,195
Somebody bit you?

355
00:18:46,361 --> 00:18:48,829
Well, not just someone.
Jon Voight.

356
00:18:49,001 --> 00:18:50,992
- Jon Voight bit you?
- Yeah, yeah.

357
00:18:53,241 --> 00:18:55,277
The pencil.
Get the pencil out of your mouth!

358
00:18:55,441 --> 00:18:58,035
You're destroying
Jon Voight's teeth marks.

359
00:18:58,201 --> 00:19:00,761
- That's Jon Voight's pencil?
- That's right.

360
00:19:00,921 --> 00:19:03,481
And I got his whole car downstairs.

361
00:19:03,641 --> 00:19:06,109
Are you the one you bought
his LeBaron convertible?

362
00:19:06,281 --> 00:19:07,953
- Yes! Yes!
- Yes!

363
00:19:08,121 --> 00:19:10,157
Yes, I'm the one.

364
00:19:10,321 --> 00:19:14,439
- So you know Jon Voight?
- Yes. I went to dental school with him.

365
00:19:15,481 --> 00:19:17,836
- Jon Voight, the actor?
- No.

366
00:19:18,001 --> 00:19:19,275
The periodontist.

367
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:22,236
Can't this wait until Monday?
Come by my office.

368
00:19:22,401 --> 00:19:26,679
- Just a quick peek. I'm in agony.
- All right. Sit down.

369
00:19:26,881 --> 00:19:29,076
It's this one here in the back.

370
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:36,871
You popped Woody Woodpecker!

371
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:41,555
Hey, who invited you anyway?
You're a troublemaker.

372
00:19:46,921 --> 00:19:49,389
Looks /ik e Woody Woodpeck er
is running out of air.

373
00:19:49,561 --> 00:19:52,121
In fact, he's co//apsing.

374
00:19:52,601 --> 00:19:55,161
Those kids look pretty disappointed.

375
00:19:55,321 --> 00:19:57,994
Especially that big kid
up in the front.

376
00:19:58,161 --> 00:19:59,435
How old is he?

377
00:20:01,961 --> 00:20:03,997
- Hello.
- He//o, is this Jerry Seinfe/d?

378
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,879
- Yes, it is.
- You don't know me...

379
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,793
...but a really
strange thing happened.

380
00:20:07,961 --> 00:20:10,031
I was at a garage sale,
and this old couple...

381
00:20:10,201 --> 00:20:11,475
...sold me used sneakers...

382
00:20:11,641 --> 00:20:14,155
...they claim belonged
to Jerry Seinfeld, the comedian.

383
00:20:14,321 --> 00:20:16,357
Could I have the address
to that garage sale?

384
00:20:16,921 --> 00:20:19,310
Okay, thank you very much.

385
00:20:19,641 --> 00:20:21,916
I found Mom and Pop.
They're selling my sneakers.

386
00:20:22,081 --> 00:20:23,912
- Where are they?
- Parsippany, New Jersey.

387
00:20:24,081 --> 00:20:25,560
Let's go.

388
00:20:26,681 --> 00:20:29,673
- My car's in the shop.
- How are we getting to Parsippany?

389
00:20:37,201 --> 00:20:38,714
Jerry...

390
00:20:38,881 --> 00:20:41,395
...these nosebleeds
are starting again.

391
00:20:41,561 --> 00:20:43,517
Maybe we should get you
to a hospital.

392
00:20:43,681 --> 00:20:45,831
I ain't going to no Bellevue.

393
00:20:46,001 --> 00:20:49,437
Look at me,
I'm falling apart here.

394
00:21:12,321 --> 00:21:14,630
The marching band
is a perfect example...

395
00:21:14,801 --> 00:21:17,873
...of taking something bad
and making it difficult too.

396
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:21,078
I mean, why does the band
have to march? We're not moving.

397
00:21:21,241 --> 00:21:24,278
Maybe if they hold still,
we could all leave.

398
00:21:24,441 --> 00:21:26,636
Is that why they do it?
People try and get away.

399
00:21:26,801 --> 00:21:30,077
"No, you don't. I'm right with you.
Right with you, buddy."

400
00:21:30,801 --> 00:21:36,034
The human urge to wave
at total strangers just moving by...

401
00:21:36,201 --> 00:21:37,953
...is very strong, isn't it?

402
00:21:38,121 --> 00:21:39,873
Parades and ocean liners...

403
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:42,760
...and those little trains that
go through amusement parks.

404
00:21:42,921 --> 00:21:45,355
It's always that bittersweet,
kind of hello-goodbye...

405
00:21:45,521 --> 00:21:47,159
...combination wave, isn't it? Just:

406
00:21:47,321 --> 00:21:49,755
I've never seen these people
before in my life...

407
00:21:49,921 --> 00:21:51,718
...and they're leaving.

408
00:21:58,681 --> 00:21:59,670
