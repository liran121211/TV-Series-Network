1
00:00:04,609 --> 00:00:06,327
Love seat is an interesting item.
Some guy thought:</i>

2
00:00:06,489 --> 00:00:09,401
"If they won't sit closer to us,
why not shorten the furniture?"</i>

3
00:00:09,569 --> 00:00:12,561
My favourite furniture brand
is the La-Z-Boy.</i>

4
00:00:12,729 --> 00:00:15,766
This is very flattering
to the prospective customer, isn't it?</i>

5
00:00:16,569 --> 00:00:20,357
Why not call it the half-conscious-
deadbeat-with-no-job-home-all-day...</i>

6
00:00:20,529 --> 00:00:24,044
...eating-Cheetos
and-watching-TV recliner?</i>

7
00:00:24,209 --> 00:00:26,643
And it goes back so far, that thing.</i>

8
00:00:26,809 --> 00:00:31,041
I mean, go to bed already.
It's over. You're wiped.</i>

9
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:37,605
So she got you to join a book club?</i>

10
00:00:37,769 --> 00:00:41,648
I got a feeling I'm gonna be
much smarter than you pretty soon.</i>

11
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:46,519
Well, I think that statement alone
reflects your burgeoning intelligence.</i>

12
00:00:46,689 --> 00:00:48,919
- What about this one?
- No, I don't like that one.</i>

13
00:00:49,089 --> 00:00:53,367
- So, what's your first book?
- Breakfast at Tiffany's. Ninety pages.</i>

14
00:00:54,569 --> 00:00:57,879
- It's kind of old, isn't it?
- They wanted a Truman Capote book.</i>

15
00:00:58,409 --> 00:00:59,808
Oh, sure, Truman Capote.</i>

16
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:01,402
- He's a great writer.
- Oh, yeah.</i>

17
00:01:01,569 --> 00:01:03,241
- Ever read anything by him?
- No. You?</i>

18
00:01:03,409 --> 00:01:05,400
No.

19
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:07,727
What about this one?</i>

20
00:01:07,889 --> 00:01:09,641
Look at this. This is it.

21
00:01:09,809 --> 00:01:12,323
This is what I'm looking for.

22
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:13,922
Oh, yeah.</i>

23
00:01:15,489 --> 00:01:17,286
- Hey, what's going on?
- New couch, baby.</i>

24
00:01:17,449 --> 00:01:19,360
New couch? Why?</i>

25
00:01:19,529 --> 00:01:22,168
I love this couch.
The best part is it doesn't fold out...</i>

26
00:01:22,329 --> 00:01:24,604
...so no one can sleep over.</i>

27
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:29,081
Hello.</i>

28
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:30,603
Hello.</i>

29
00:01:30,769 --> 00:01:32,919
Oh, let me get the door for you.</i>

30
00:01:35,449 --> 00:01:37,041
Be careful.</i>

31
00:01:37,209 --> 00:01:39,359
Wait till you see it. It's perfect.</i>

32
00:01:39,529 --> 00:01:42,248
The guy told me it's one of a kind.
They stopped making it.</i>

33
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:43,842
What are you doing
with your old couch?</i>

34
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:45,965
The moving guys are taking it.
You want it?</i>

35
00:01:46,129 --> 00:01:49,326
- Yeah, I'll take it.
- I'm sure they can deliver it to you.</i>

36
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:51,721
Yes, they can.</i>

37
00:01:52,569 --> 00:01:54,287
- Hey, couch is coming.
- It's here.</i>

38
00:01:54,449 --> 00:01:57,247
All right. Yeah. You know,
I'm excited about this, Jerry.</i>

39
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:59,320
In a way,
I feel I'm getting a new couch.</i>

40
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:00,968
Yeah, so do I.</i>

41
00:02:01,729 --> 00:02:03,321
You remember Poppie?</i>

42
00:02:03,769 --> 00:02:05,964
- You mean from Poppie's restaurant?
- Yeah, yeah.</i>

43
00:02:06,129 --> 00:02:08,279
Anyway, we're going
into business together.</i>

44
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:10,041
Remember my idea
about the place...</i>

45
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:12,769
- ... where you make your own pizza?
- What was that again?</i>

46
00:02:12,929 --> 00:02:15,124
It's a pizza place
where you make your own pie.</i>

47
00:02:15,289 --> 00:02:17,484
We give you the dough,
the sauce, the cheese.</i>

48
00:02:17,649 --> 00:02:21,767
You pound it, slap it,
you flip it up into the air...</i>

49
00:02:21,929 --> 00:02:25,604
...put your toppings on,
and you slide it into the oven.</i>

50
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:27,407
That sounds good, huh?

51
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:31,084
I can't wait to get me a fella
and make my own pie.</i>

52
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:33,487
What made you resurrect
that old idea?</i>

53
00:02:33,649 --> 00:02:35,640
Well, I happened to be
eating at Poppie's...</i>

54
00:02:35,809 --> 00:02:38,277
...when I told him the old idea
and his eyes:</i>

55
00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:40,123
Just lit up.

56
00:02:40,289 --> 00:02:43,486
- You know, he wants to back it.
- I heard Poppie's was good. Let's go.</i>

57
00:02:43,649 --> 00:02:46,527
I'm not going. Didn't he get busted
by the board of health?</i>

58
00:02:46,689 --> 00:02:48,327
No, that was in the past, Jerry.</i>

59
00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:51,481
As it happens, New York magazine
just judged his kitchen...</i>

60
00:02:51,649 --> 00:02:53,480
...to be one of the cleanest
in the city.</i>

61
00:02:53,649 --> 00:02:56,846
They got a duck there,
you think you died and went to heaven.</i>

62
00:02:57,609 --> 00:02:59,725
I love duck. Come on, come on.</i>

63
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:03,564
You gotta order it two days in advance.
I'll call. I'll order the duck for you.</i>

64
00:03:03,729 --> 00:03:05,560
Kramer, I-</i>

65
00:03:10,809 --> 00:03:13,448
Right there, guys. That's perfect.</i>

66
00:03:14,329 --> 00:03:15,728
What do you think, Lainey?</i>

67
00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:18,119
Well, I don't know.
I'll have to sit on it.</i>

68
00:03:18,289 --> 00:03:20,405
Oh, no, I don't want anyone
sitting on it.</i>

69
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:22,448
Sign here.</i>

70
00:03:23,289 --> 00:03:25,678
Excuse me. I was wondering
if it would be possible...</i>

71
00:03:25,849 --> 00:03:28,488
...if you could you deliver
the old couch to my apartment?</i>

72
00:03:28,649 --> 00:03:29,968
- It's not very far.
- Sure.</i>

73
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:33,166
Okay. You got room
in the truck for me?</i>

74
00:03:34,929 --> 00:03:36,328
I think we can squeeze you in.</i>

75
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:40,198
Oh, goody. Okay. Well...</i>

76
00:03:40,369 --> 00:03:43,327
...I'll see you chumps later.</i>

77
00:03:44,409 --> 00:03:48,038
- Did you offer those guys a drink?
- No. Should I have?</i>

78
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:51,838
- What kind of a person are you?
- I don't know.</i>

79
00:03:52,529 --> 00:03:54,121
Okay, Breakfast at Tiffany's.</i>

80
00:04:09,009 --> 00:04:10,727
So he puts the couch down...</i>

81
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:15,440
...and just as he's about to leave,
he says, "Do you date moving men?"</i>

82
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:19,884
- You wanna know what I said?
- I can't wait.

83
00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:22,165
"I do now."

84
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:24,482
- Clever.
- Is that something?</i>

85
00:04:24,649 --> 00:04:27,402
- Is that something?
- Yes, you're something.</i>

86
00:04:28,689 --> 00:04:31,408
So anyway,
when they were in my house before...</i>

87
00:04:31,569 --> 00:04:33,639
...I didn't offer them
anything to drink.</i>

88
00:04:33,809 --> 00:04:36,448
Well, they're real men, Jerry.
They get sweaty.</i>

89
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,203
So anyone sweaty in your house
has to be offered a drink?</i>

90
00:04:39,369 --> 00:04:40,768
Yes.</i>

91
00:04:41,369 --> 00:04:42,688
Would you apologize for me?</i>

92
00:04:43,289 --> 00:04:47,407
Hello. Jerry,
so good to see you again.</i>

93
00:04:48,049 --> 00:04:49,641
Hello...</i>

94
00:04:49,809 --> 00:04:51,128
...Poppie.</i>

95
00:04:51,289 --> 00:04:53,519
- This is Elaine.
- Nice to meet you, Poppie.</i>

96
00:04:53,689 --> 00:04:56,283
- Let me show you to your table.
- Okay.</i>

97
00:04:56,449 --> 00:04:59,247
Your duck is cooking
as we speak.</i>

98
00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:03,402
It is so succulent, so succulent.</i>

99
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:06,129
Kramer told us all about
your business venture together.</i>

100
00:05:06,289 --> 00:05:10,168
Your friend and I
are gonna make a lot of money.</i>

101
00:05:10,369 --> 00:05:12,963
Of course,
I already have a lot of money.</i>

102
00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:15,444
Poppie does very well.</i>

103
00:05:15,609 --> 00:05:17,804
Very well.</i>

104
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:21,407
Well, your mother
must be very proud of you.</i>

105
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:26,440
My mother
was taken from my house...</i>

106
00:05:26,609 --> 00:05:28,918
...by the communists
in the middle of the night...</i>

107
00:05:29,089 --> 00:05:31,557
...when I was 10 years old.</i>

108
00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:34,527
She was sent
to a slave-labour camp...</i>

109
00:05:34,689 --> 00:05:37,442
...where she laboured for 12 years.</i>

110
00:05:37,609 --> 00:05:40,442
Finally, they released her...</i>

111
00:05:40,609 --> 00:05:44,284
...and she was on a boat to America
to reunite with us.</i>

112
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:46,758
But she was served some bad fish...</i>

113
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:51,480
...and she died on the high seas.</i>

114
00:05:54,809 --> 00:05:56,925
So, what's good tonight?

115
00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:11,165
Boy, I'm really looking forward
to this duck.</i>

116
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:14,127
I've never had food
ordered in advance before.</i>

117
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:16,678
Could have stayed home,
ordered pizza from Pokeno's.</i>

118
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:20,687
Pokeno's? Oh, no. You should never
order pizza from Pokeno's.</i>

119
00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:23,761
- Why not?
- The owner contributes money...</i>

120
00:06:23,929 --> 00:06:25,885
...to those fanatical
anti-abortion groups.</i>

121
00:06:26,049 --> 00:06:28,165
- So you won't eat the pizza?
- No way.</i>

122
00:06:28,329 --> 00:06:29,603
- Really?
- Yeah.</i>

123
00:06:29,769 --> 00:06:31,760
Well, what if...</i>

124
00:06:31,929 --> 00:06:33,920
...Poppie felt the same way?</i>

125
00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:36,808
Well, I guess
I wouldn't eat here then.</i>

126
00:06:36,969 --> 00:06:38,368
Really?</i>

127
00:06:38,529 --> 00:06:39,803
Yeah, that's right.</i>

128
00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:41,925
Well, perhaps we should inquire.</i>

129
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:45,125
Poppie? Oh, Poppie?</i>

130
00:06:45,329 --> 00:06:49,322
- Could I have a word?
- Yes, Jerry. I just checked your duck.</i>

131
00:06:49,489 --> 00:06:52,049
It is more succulent
than even I had hoped.</i>

132
00:06:52,209 --> 00:06:55,724
Poppie, I was just curious.
Where do you stand on abortion?</i>

133
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:58,767
When my mother was abducted
by the communists...</i>

134
00:06:58,929 --> 00:07:00,840
- ... she was with a child.
- Oh, boy.</i>

135
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:03,159
But the communists,
they put an end to that.</i>

136
00:07:03,329 --> 00:07:05,638
So on this issue,
there is no debate...</i>

137
00:07:05,809 --> 00:07:08,687
...and no intelligent person
can think differently.</i>

138
00:07:09,489 --> 00:07:14,927
- Well, Poppie, I think differently.
- What gives you the right to do that?</i>

139
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:19,360
The Supreme Court
gives me the right to do that!</i>

140
00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:20,803
Let's go, Jerry. Come on.</i>

141
00:07:20,969 --> 00:07:23,164
I heard that. Let's go, Henry.</i>

142
00:07:23,329 --> 00:07:26,082
- We just got here.
- I'm with you, Poppie.</i>

143
00:07:26,249 --> 00:07:29,241
- Let's go.
- And I am not coming back!</i>

144
00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:32,128
You're not welcome!</i>

145
00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:38,322
Well, I'm certainly glad
I brought it up.</i>

146
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:43,687
Well, you should've seen it.
It was quite a scene over there.</i>

147
00:07:43,849 --> 00:07:46,443
- I'm sorry I missed it.
- Oh, you really missed something.</i>

148
00:07:46,609 --> 00:07:48,565
And I have to say...</i>

149
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:51,038
...it was pretty much all my fault.</i>

150
00:07:53,369 --> 00:07:54,927
So how's the book coming?</i>

151
00:07:57,889 --> 00:08:00,722
- I say how's the book coming?
- Oh, pretty good.</i>

152
00:08:01,249 --> 00:08:02,523
So, what's it about?

153
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,638
- Well, it's about Holly Golightly.
- Holly Golightly.</i>

154
00:08:05,809 --> 00:08:08,528
- Yeah, she's quite a character.
- Haven't read a page, huh?</i>

155
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:11,203
- No.
- Big surprise.</i>

156
00:08:11,369 --> 00:08:15,681
I couldn't. If it's not about sports,
I find it very hard to concentrate.</i>

157
00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:18,969
You're not very bright, are you?</i>

158
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:21,000
No, I'm not.

159
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:24,718
I would like to be, but I'm not.
What am I gonna do?</i>

160
00:08:24,929 --> 00:08:28,478
- The book club meets in a few days.
- Why don't you rent the movie?</i>

161
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:31,484
Why don't I rent the movie?</i>

162
00:08:31,649 --> 00:08:34,641
You see? This is when I like you.
Now I'm relieved.</i>

163
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:38,244
So...

164
00:08:38,449 --> 00:08:40,121
...how was the dinner last night?</i>

165
00:08:41,449 --> 00:08:42,848
Oh, well...</i>

166
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:45,087
Did you enjoy the duck?</i>

167
00:08:45,249 --> 00:08:48,605
Oh, Elaine, I was just asking
how dinner went last night.</i>

168
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:51,843
- Oh, well-
- All right, what did you do to Poppie?</i>

169
00:08:52,689 --> 00:08:54,919
- Nothing.
- Well, he's in the hospital.</i>

170
00:08:55,089 --> 00:08:57,000
And the cook says
you put him there.</i>

171
00:08:57,689 --> 00:08:59,964
- What's wrong with him?
- I don't know.

172
00:09:00,129 --> 00:09:01,881
I'm gonna go and visit him later.</i>

173
00:09:02,049 --> 00:09:06,008
It would be nice
if you got him something.</i>

174
00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:10,283
We should get him something.</i>

175
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:12,644
Yeah, you're right.</i>

176
00:09:14,689 --> 00:09:19,285
Do you know I've been using the same
bottle of shampoo for a year?</i>

177
00:09:19,489 --> 00:09:21,480
And I shampoo every day.</i>

178
00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:24,920
So, what do you think
of my conversation?</i>

179
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:26,761
Not much.

180
00:09:30,609 --> 00:09:33,169
I would've invited you up...</i>

181
00:09:33,329 --> 00:09:34,967
...but I don't have any furniture.</i>

182
00:09:35,169 --> 00:09:39,481
- You don't have any furniture?
- No, I hate furniture. I can't look at it.</i>

183
00:09:42,929 --> 00:09:45,284
Oh, I can understand that.</i>

184
00:09:47,369 --> 00:09:50,725
- A pretty good date, huh?
- Yeah, no heavy lifting.</i>

185
00:10:00,329 --> 00:10:03,082
Jerry and Elaine felt bad
about what happened to you...</i>

186
00:10:03,249 --> 00:10:04,682
...and wanted you to have this.</i>

187
00:10:07,129 --> 00:10:08,687
What's this?

188
00:10:08,849 --> 00:10:12,967
A bottle of wine
and a five-alarm chilli?</i>

189
00:10:13,129 --> 00:10:15,882
- They're trying to kill Poppie?
- Why?</i>

190
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:18,517
Don't they know
I have a gastrointestinal disorder?</i>

191
00:10:19,049 --> 00:10:21,802
If I would have any of this,
I would die.</i>

192
00:10:21,969 --> 00:10:27,680
Then Poppie's no good to anyone.
This is a sick, sick joke on Poppie.</i>

193
00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:30,926
How could you be friends
with those two?</i>

194
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:33,364
Well, we're not very close.</i>

195
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:36,043
- They owe me for those ducks.
- Yeah.</i>

196
00:10:36,209 --> 00:10:39,406
- They're flown in from Newfoundland.
- They got good ducks there, huh?</i>

197
00:10:39,569 --> 00:10:41,400
Very good ducks.</i>

198
00:10:43,969 --> 00:10:46,847
I'm in love!</i>

199
00:10:47,729 --> 00:10:52,120
This is it, Jerry! This is it!
He is such an incredible person.</i>

200
00:10:52,289 --> 00:10:55,122
He's real. He's honest.
He's unpretentious.</i>

201
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:57,086
Oh, I'm really lucky.</i>

202
00:10:58,089 --> 00:11:00,125
Did you tell him I was sorry
about the drink?</i>

203
00:11:00,289 --> 00:11:02,041
No. I forgot.

204
00:11:02,249 --> 00:11:04,922
The best part is,
he doesn't play games.</i>

205
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:06,727
You know? There are no games.</i>

206
00:11:06,889 --> 00:11:09,881
No games? What is the point
of dating without games?</i>

207
00:11:10,049 --> 00:11:12,199
How do you know
if you're winning or losing?</i>

208
00:11:12,369 --> 00:11:13,643
Well, all I know is...</i>

209
00:11:13,809 --> 00:11:16,198
...he doesn't like games,
and he doesn't play games.</i>

210
00:11:16,369 --> 00:11:18,599
He has too much character
and integrity.</i>

211
00:11:19,489 --> 00:11:23,164
And what is his stand on abortion?

212
00:11:27,089 --> 00:11:28,761
What?

213
00:11:30,209 --> 00:11:32,359
What is his stand...

214
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:34,679
...on abortion?

215
00:11:37,409 --> 00:11:41,368
- Well, I'm sure he's pro-choice.
- How do you know?</i>

216
00:11:42,929 --> 00:11:45,159
Because he...</i>

217
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:46,842
Well...</i>

218
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:49,443
He's just so good-looking.</i>

219
00:11:50,249 --> 00:11:51,841
Well, you should probably ask.</i>

220
00:11:52,009 --> 00:11:56,366
Because if he's gonna be coming over
with those Pokeno's pizzas...</i>

221
00:11:56,529 --> 00:11:58,121
...could be trouble.</i>

222
00:12:01,449 --> 00:12:05,328
- I'd like to rent Breakfast at Tiffany's.
- This is out. Someone has it.</i>

223
00:12:05,489 --> 00:12:06,763
Out? Oh, no, I've-</i>

224
00:12:06,929 --> 00:12:09,443
I've been to four places.
You're the only ones with it.</i>

225
00:12:09,609 --> 00:12:11,884
I could put it on reserve for you
if you'd like.</i>

226
00:12:12,049 --> 00:12:15,564
Maybe we could call them
and ask them to return it.</i>

227
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:18,724
Sorry, we can't do that.</i>

228
00:12:18,889 --> 00:12:21,642
Well, maybe they're done with it.
I could go pick it up.</i>

229
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:25,006
I don't think so.
It doesn't work that way.</i>

230
00:12:41,329 --> 00:12:43,126
Yes?</i>

231
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:47,717
Excuse me, are you Joe Temple?</i>

232
00:12:47,889 --> 00:12:49,607
Yes.</i>

233
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:53,004
Yes, you don't know me.</i>

234
00:12:53,169 --> 00:12:55,399
My name is George Costanza.</i>

235
00:12:55,569 --> 00:12:58,561
Did you happen to rent
Breakfast at Tiffany's?</i>

236
00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:02,803
- Hey.
- What's happening?</i>

237
00:13:02,969 --> 00:13:04,561
You know,
Poppie's over at my place.</i>

238
00:13:04,729 --> 00:13:08,119
Tonight's the big night. I'll make
the first test pizza at the restaurant.</i>

239
00:13:08,289 --> 00:13:11,679
You got a regular Manhattan Project
going on over there.</i>

240
00:13:11,849 --> 00:13:14,124
Anyway, he's about to go.
He wants the duck money.</i>

241
00:13:14,289 --> 00:13:17,042
- Oh, okay. Hi, Poppie.
- Hello.</i>

242
00:13:17,209 --> 00:13:19,803
Sorry about the gift.
I didn't know about your condition.</i>

243
00:13:19,969 --> 00:13:21,243
That's fine.</i>

244
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:23,604
If you give me my duck money,
I'll be on my way.</i>

245
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:25,566
Okay, I'll get it.</i>

246
00:13:26,449 --> 00:13:29,486
Why don't you sit down, Poppie.
You're still recuperating.</i>

247
00:13:37,369 --> 00:13:39,200
Are you tired, Poppie?</i>

248
00:13:39,369 --> 00:13:42,645
- No.
- Poppie, you really think people...</i>

249
00:13:42,809 --> 00:13:44,208
...wanna make their own pizza?</i>

250
00:13:44,369 --> 00:13:47,918
Kramer, did I ever tell you
about my mother?</i>

251
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,684
- My mother-
- Here you go.</i>

252
00:13:51,849 --> 00:13:55,364
Anyway, I'm sorry again about the...</i>

253
00:13:55,529 --> 00:13:56,848
- The...
- The what?</i>

254
00:13:57,009 --> 00:13:58,886
The...</i>

255
00:14:00,009 --> 00:14:02,398
- The- The...
- Okay, Poppie. So long, huh?</i>

256
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:04,961
I'll see you tonight.</i>

257
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,681
Kramer, what is this?</i>

258
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:10,805
- What is what?
- This puddle on my sofa!</i>

259
00:14:10,969 --> 00:14:13,244
- What puddle?
- That puddle!</i>

260
00:14:16,409 --> 00:14:17,762
I don't know.

261
00:14:18,569 --> 00:14:20,048
Is it...?

262
00:14:20,849 --> 00:14:22,282
Could it...?

263
00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:25,319
Could he have...?</i>

264
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:27,081
It is!

265
00:14:27,249 --> 00:14:29,763
Poppie peed on my sofa!</i>

266
00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:33,882
- Are you sure?
- Well, what is it, then?</i>

267
00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:41,164
My new sofa!
Poppie peed on my new sofa!</i>

268
00:14:41,329 --> 00:14:42,762
I'm sure it'll come out.</i>

269
00:14:42,929 --> 00:14:45,966
I don't care if it comes out.
I can't sit on that anymore.</i>

270
00:14:46,129 --> 00:14:48,689
- You're making too much of it.
- Yeah, you're right.</i>

271
00:14:48,849 --> 00:14:52,444
Just a natural human function.
Happens to be on my sofa...</i>

272
00:14:52,609 --> 00:14:55,521
...instead of in the toilet,
where it would normally be.</i>

273
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:57,003
Right.

274
00:14:57,969 --> 00:15:00,529
Well, anyway, the book club
meets tomorrow, Mr. Temple.</i>

275
00:15:01,129 --> 00:15:04,838
Well, I was gonna watch it
with my daughter.</i>

276
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:06,761
She likes Audrey Hepburn
very much.</i>

277
00:15:06,929 --> 00:15:09,887
Yeah, she was a delicate flower.</i>

278
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:13,958
Why didn't you
just read the book?</i>

279
00:15:15,569 --> 00:15:19,562
Well, as I say, the pinkeye
made my vision quite blurry.</i>

280
00:15:19,729 --> 00:15:21,447
Remy.</i>

281
00:15:22,049 --> 00:15:24,165
This is George.</i>

282
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:28,001
Would you mind if he watched
Breakfast at Tiffany's with us?</i>

283
00:15:33,449 --> 00:15:35,758
- Hi.
- Hi.

284
00:15:36,089 --> 00:15:37,807
- I missed you.
- Oh, I missed you.</i>

285
00:15:37,969 --> 00:15:40,085
I don't remember the last time
I felt this way.</i>

286
00:15:40,249 --> 00:15:41,523
Me either.</i>

287
00:15:41,689 --> 00:15:43,680
- I think about you all the time.
- You do?</i>

288
00:15:43,849 --> 00:15:46,158
- Do you think about me?
- Oh, yeah, all the time.</i>

289
00:15:46,329 --> 00:15:47,648
All the time.</i>

290
00:15:47,809 --> 00:15:49,242
Although...

291
00:15:49,409 --> 00:15:52,207
...recently I've been thinking
about this friend of mine.</i>

292
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:55,839
- What friend?
- Oh, just this woman.</i>

293
00:15:56,009 --> 00:15:59,718
She got impregnated
by her troglodytic half-brother...</i>

294
00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:02,528
...and decided to have an abortion.</i>

295
00:16:05,849 --> 00:16:07,248
You know, someday...</i>

296
00:16:07,409 --> 00:16:10,765
...we're gonna get enough people on
the Supreme Court to change that law.</i>

297
00:16:17,489 --> 00:16:20,162
So anything to nosh?

298
00:16:24,369 --> 00:16:26,405
What did you want?

299
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:28,127
Popcorn?

300
00:16:28,289 --> 00:16:31,406
Popcorn?
Where do you think you are?</i>

301
00:16:31,569 --> 00:16:33,480
A lot of people
keep popcorn in the house.</i>

302
00:16:33,649 --> 00:16:35,844
Well, we don't.</i>

303
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:40,605
You might wanna try it.

304
00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:42,725
Makes the movie more enjoyable,
that's all.</i>

305
00:16:42,929 --> 00:16:46,638
- Here's some nuts.
- Oh, nuts! Excellent!</i>

306
00:16:47,169 --> 00:16:50,206
You know what I love? How there's
two nuts named after people:</i>

307
00:16:50,369 --> 00:16:52,485
Hazel and Filbert.</i>

308
00:16:54,769 --> 00:16:57,681
Can we watch
the movie now, Daddy?</i>

309
00:16:57,849 --> 00:17:00,966
Hey, let's turn off the lights,
get some real movie atmosphere.</i>

310
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:03,597
The lights are fine.</i>

311
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:08,958
See? Everybody can do this.
Yeah.</i>

312
00:17:09,129 --> 00:17:12,280
No, no. Use your wrist.
It's all in the wrist.</i>

313
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:14,644
- Oh, yeah.
- Not too high!</i>

314
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:16,845
Very good. That's very good.</i>

315
00:17:17,009 --> 00:17:20,240
All right,
put a little sauce on here.</i>

316
00:17:24,249 --> 00:17:27,082
- Now some cheese.
- Not too much.</i>

317
00:17:27,249 --> 00:17:29,319
And cucumbers.</i>

318
00:17:29,489 --> 00:17:31,798
Hey, wait a second.
What is that?</i>

319
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:33,563
- It's cucumbers.
- No, no.</i>

320
00:17:33,729 --> 00:17:35,321
You can't put cucumbers
on a pizza.</i>

321
00:17:35,489 --> 00:17:37,002
Why not? I like cucumbers.</i>

322
00:17:37,169 --> 00:17:39,478
That's not a pizza.
It will taste terrible.</i>

323
00:17:39,649 --> 00:17:41,640
But that's the idea.
Make your own pie.</i>

324
00:17:41,809 --> 00:17:44,642
Yes, but we cannot give the people
the right...</i>

325
00:17:44,809 --> 00:17:46,925
...to choose any topping they want.</i>

326
00:17:47,089 --> 00:17:49,319
Now, on this issue,
there can be no debate.</i>

327
00:17:49,489 --> 00:17:51,684
What gives you the right
to tell me how I make my pie?</i>

328
00:17:51,849 --> 00:17:53,123
Because it's a pizza.</i>

329
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:55,484
It's not a pizza
till it comes out of the oven.</i>

330
00:17:55,649 --> 00:17:58,447
It's a pizza the moment
you put your fists in the dough.</i>

331
00:17:58,609 --> 00:18:00,167
- No, it isn't!
- Yes, it is!</i>

332
00:18:08,609 --> 00:18:10,486
- I'm home.
- Hey, honey.</i>

333
00:18:10,649 --> 00:18:12,799
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, baby.

334
00:18:12,969 --> 00:18:14,607
Hello.</i>

335
00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:19,404
- Breakfast at Tiffany's?
- Yeah.</i>

336
00:18:19,569 --> 00:18:22,766
I just came back from Angela's.
It's not looking very good for Duncan.</i>

337
00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:24,487
Oh, that's too bad.

338
00:18:24,649 --> 00:18:27,527
The doctor thinks
it's just a matter of time.</i>

339
00:18:30,889 --> 00:18:33,483
Joe. Could you...?</i>

340
00:18:33,649 --> 00:18:36,004
Poor guy.
I hate to see him suffer like this.</i>

341
00:18:36,169 --> 00:18:38,285
- Yeah.
- You know, I'm sorry.</i>

342
00:18:38,449 --> 00:18:40,041
I hate to be one of those people...</i>

343
00:18:40,209 --> 00:18:42,518
...but we're right in the middle
of this thing.</i>

344
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:44,042
I can't hear.</i>

345
00:18:44,689 --> 00:18:48,443
- Who are you?
- This is George Costanza.</i>

346
00:18:48,609 --> 00:18:51,328
It's just very hard to follow,
with all the talking.</i>

347
00:18:52,849 --> 00:18:55,409
I'll pause it, okay?</i>

348
00:18:57,209 --> 00:18:59,086
Any more grape juice?</i>

349
00:19:02,369 --> 00:19:03,802
So who is this guy?

350
00:19:03,969 --> 00:19:06,767
- He's in some book club.
- And what's he doing here?</i>

351
00:19:06,929 --> 00:19:08,840
Cheating on his test.</i>

352
00:19:12,049 --> 00:19:14,927
So we watching the movie
or are we still talking?</i>

353
00:19:16,249 --> 00:19:18,240
Okay, come on, let's go.</i>

354
00:19:19,009 --> 00:19:20,601
What?

355
00:19:20,769 --> 00:19:24,079
- Come on, you took my seat.
- It's not your seat.</i>

356
00:19:24,449 --> 00:19:28,806
- I was sitting there. Come on.
- You didn't save it.</i>

357
00:19:29,529 --> 00:19:32,999
- I had the arm. Joe.
- What's the difference?</i>

358
00:19:33,169 --> 00:19:35,558
I was very comfortable.
I've got my nuts here.</i>

359
00:19:35,729 --> 00:19:37,799
It's my couch.

360
00:19:38,449 --> 00:19:40,360
All right, come on.
Come on, scootch over.</i>

361
00:19:40,529 --> 00:19:43,407
- Wait, it's my seat!
- Stop being like a 2-year-old.</i>

362
00:19:47,409 --> 00:19:49,240
Look! Look what you did!

363
00:19:49,409 --> 00:19:51,161
You got grape juice
all over our couch.</i>

364
00:19:51,329 --> 00:19:53,559
You ruined our couch!</i>

365
00:19:54,009 --> 00:19:55,647
Joe.</i>

366
00:19:59,569 --> 00:20:02,766
- Oh, my God.
- You see?</i>

367
00:20:03,649 --> 00:20:06,925
- So are you gonna get a new couch?
- Well, I guess I have no choice.</i>

368
00:20:07,129 --> 00:20:10,007
- What? Do you want your old couch?
- I was hoping you'd offer.</i>

369
00:20:12,649 --> 00:20:14,128
- Yeah?
- It's the movers.</i>

370
00:20:14,289 --> 00:20:15,961
- Okay.
- Who's that?

371
00:20:16,129 --> 00:20:19,121
- Your boyfriend. He's taking it out.
- No, he's not my boyfriend.</i>

372
00:20:19,289 --> 00:20:20,642
Why?

373
00:20:20,809 --> 00:20:22,083
Take a guess.</i>

374
00:20:23,249 --> 00:20:25,319
Oh, really.</i>

375
00:20:27,329 --> 00:20:28,648
- Hi.
- Hi.

376
00:20:28,809 --> 00:20:30,720
Carl, I also need you
to go to Elaine's...</i>

377
00:20:30,889 --> 00:20:32,686
- ... and bring my old couch back.
- Today?

378
00:20:32,849 --> 00:20:34,328
- Could you?
- Sure.</i>

379
00:20:34,489 --> 00:20:36,320
Well, what are you doing
with this couch?</i>

380
00:20:36,489 --> 00:20:38,480
George is taking it.</i>

381
00:20:38,689 --> 00:20:41,328
Did you tell him it was peed on?</i>

382
00:20:41,489 --> 00:20:44,287
He said he doesn't care.
He'll just turn the cushion over.</i>

383
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:49,406
- I'm sorry you feel that way, Elaine.
- Yeah, me too.</i>

384
00:20:49,569 --> 00:20:52,322
- It's just too bad.
- Yeah, it is.</i>

385
00:20:52,489 --> 00:20:55,879
Well, I better get this couch
back to Jerry's.</i>

386
00:20:56,049 --> 00:20:59,928
- Can I offer you anything to drink?
- Yeah, sure.</i>

387
00:21:00,369 --> 00:21:03,486
- All I've got is grape juice.
- Throw it.</i>

388
00:21:04,849 --> 00:21:06,726
The couch!</i>

389
00:21:16,649 --> 00:21:19,038
She didn't want the constraints
of any relationship.</i>

390
00:21:19,209 --> 00:21:20,847
That's why she got rid of the cat.</i>

391
00:21:21,009 --> 00:21:24,888
The most important thing in Holly's life
was her independence.</i>

392
00:21:25,049 --> 00:21:27,040
Well, not really.</i>

393
00:21:27,209 --> 00:21:29,404
After all, she got together
with George Peppard.</i>

394
00:21:33,169 --> 00:21:34,568
I mean, Fred.</i>

395
00:21:35,249 --> 00:21:37,683
George, Fred's gay.</i>
