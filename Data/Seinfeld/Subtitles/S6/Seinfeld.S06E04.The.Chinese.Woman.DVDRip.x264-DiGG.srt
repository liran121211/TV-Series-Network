1
00:00:02,529 --> 00:00:04,281
The thing I admire
about the Chinese...</i>

2
00:00:05,889 --> 00:00:07,561
...is they're hanging in there
with the chopsticks.</i>

3
00:00:07,729 --> 00:00:11,165
Because if you think about it,
they've seen the fork by now.</i>

4
00:00:11,729 --> 00:00:16,644
I'm sure they've seen the spoon.
They're going, "Yeah, they're okay.</i>

5
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:19,243
We're gonna stay with the sticks."</i>

6
00:00:19,849 --> 00:00:21,680
I mean,
I don't know how they missed it.</i>

7
00:00:21,849 --> 00:00:24,079
Thousands of years ago,
Chinese farmer gets up...</i>

8
00:00:24,249 --> 00:00:26,160
...has his breakfast
with the chopsticks...</i>

9
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:30,242
...goes out and works all day
in the field with a shovel.</i>

10
00:00:30,409 --> 00:00:31,842
Hello?</i>

11
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:33,727
Shovel?</i>

12
00:00:34,529 --> 00:00:38,488
Not going out there ploughing 40 acres
with a couple of pool cues.</i>

13
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:45,682
Good shave today.</i>

14
00:00:45,849 --> 00:00:47,487
Don't worry,
I can manage these bags.</i>

15
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:48,923
Really, I'm fine.</i>

16
00:00:49,089 --> 00:00:51,125
I'm thinking of letting
my sideburns grow in.</i>

17
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:55,521
- Can we rest here a second?
- Yeah, I guess.</i>

18
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:59,718
- So how's Noreen?
- She got a new boyfriend. Paul.</i>

19
00:00:59,889 --> 00:01:01,607
Already? That was fast.</i>

20
00:01:01,769 --> 00:01:03,248
I assume he's not a high-talker.</i>

21
00:01:03,409 --> 00:01:05,718
No, but he has the worst habit.</i>

22
00:01:05,889 --> 00:01:08,608
Whenever he answers the phone,
he won't put Noreen right on.</i>

23
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:10,760
You must go through 10 minutes
of chit-chat.</i>

24
00:01:10,929 --> 00:01:13,159
- A long-talker.
- Yeah.</i>

25
00:01:13,329 --> 00:01:15,285
He is so boring.</i>

26
00:01:15,449 --> 00:01:17,724
Now whenever he answers the phone,
I just hang up.</i>

27
00:01:17,889 --> 00:01:20,119
All right, let's move it out.</i>

28
00:01:22,569 --> 00:01:24,719
Hey, isn't that George's father?</i>

29
00:01:24,889 --> 00:01:27,164
Oh, yeah, it is.
Should we say hello?</i>

30
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:31,322
I've never seen him in Manhattan
before. It's weird. It's so out of context.</i>

31
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,840
That man he's with...</i>

32
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:36,763
...is he wearing a cape?</i>

33
00:01:37,329 --> 00:01:39,365
I believe he is wearing a cape.</i>

34
00:01:40,929 --> 00:01:43,887
Why is Mr. Costanza
with a man in a cape?</i>

35
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:47,041
Well, it is good cape weather.
Cool, breezy.</i>

36
00:01:47,209 --> 00:01:49,962
Why a cape? Who wears a cape?</i>

37
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:52,245
Where do you even get a cape?</i>

38
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:54,127
You're right, it is strange.</i>

39
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:57,008
In fact, let's cross
to the other side of the street.</i>

40
00:01:57,489 --> 00:01:59,639
Cover me.</i>

41
00:02:05,889 --> 00:02:08,881
Just plop it on the counter there.</i>

42
00:02:10,769 --> 00:02:12,521
Oh, I got a message.</i>

43
00:02:15,889 --> 00:02:17,447
Hey, it's George.</i>

44
00:02:17,609 --> 00:02:19,440
I got nothing to say.</i>

45
00:02:21,329 --> 00:02:23,001
That sounds urgent.</i>

46
00:02:23,169 --> 00:02:24,966
Let me call him back.</i>

47
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:27,442
Hello?</i>

48
00:02:27,609 --> 00:02:28,962
Who is this?

49
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:30,767
Donna Chang?

50
00:02:30,929 --> 00:02:33,204
I'm sorry. I must have dialled
the wrong number.</i>

51
00:02:33,369 --> 00:02:34,358
Donna Chang?

52
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,167
Should've talked.
I love Chinese women.</i>

53
00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:38,365
Isn't that a little racist?</i>

54
00:02:38,529 --> 00:02:42,522
If I like their race,
how can that be racist?</i>

55
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:46,728
Hello?</i>

56
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:48,880
Oh, is this Donna Chang again?

57
00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:51,324
Yes, I am calling George.</i>

58
00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:54,367
Oh, the lines are crossed.
You're getting his calls.</i>

59
00:02:54,529 --> 00:02:56,520
Well, what do you know.</i>

60
00:02:57,209 --> 00:02:58,483
- Hi.
- So listen...</i>

61
00:02:58,649 --> 00:03:01,163
I'm going through this stuff
like water.</i>

62
00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:04,643
- Who are you talking to?
- He's on with a Chinese woman.</i>

63
00:03:05,809 --> 00:03:07,720
You know, I dig Asian women.</i>

64
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,044
You got a comfort problem there?</i>

65
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:14,447
No, I think these Jockeys shrunk.</i>

66
00:03:15,809 --> 00:03:17,640
- I thought you wore silk underwear.
- No.</i>

67
00:03:17,809 --> 00:03:20,243
I wore them for a month,
but I couldn't stick with it.</i>

68
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:23,481
I need the secure packaging
of Jockeys.</i>

69
00:03:24,609 --> 00:03:26,918
My boys need a house.</i>

70
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:33,521
That's nice.</i>

71
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:37,047
Listen, if you ever wanna have kids,
you shouldn't wear briefs.</i>

72
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:38,961
Boxers are better
for your sperm count.</i>

73
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:41,002
Sperm count?</i>

74
00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:43,399
Well, how many sperm
should I have?</i>

75
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:45,685
A lot.

76
00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:47,647
I got a date.</i>

77
00:03:47,809 --> 00:03:49,845
- With the Chinese woman?
- She knew who I was.</i>

78
00:03:50,009 --> 00:03:51,408
She saw me at a club one time.</i>

79
00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:54,999
My first date ever with the Pacific Rim.
I'm very excited.</i>

80
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:57,967
Jerry, you ever have
your sperm count checked?</i>

81
00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:00,723
No, why should I? I wear boxers.</i>

82
00:04:01,369 --> 00:04:02,848
You ever get a woman pregnant?</i>

83
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:05,921
I'm sorry, Kramer. Those records
are permanently sealed.</i>

84
00:04:06,089 --> 00:04:09,559
What would you say if I told you
I never impregnated a woman?</i>

85
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:11,003
Really?</i>

86
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:13,558
Never slipped one past the goalie
in all these years?</i>

87
00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:17,644
I'm surprised.
You've slept with a lot of women.</i>

88
00:04:17,809 --> 00:04:19,447
A lot of women!</i>

89
00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:22,648
Do you think maybe I'm...</i>

90
00:04:22,809 --> 00:04:24,765
...depleted?</i>

91
00:04:24,929 --> 00:04:27,238
Well, I'm sure you're not
totally depleted.</i>

92
00:04:27,409 --> 00:04:30,242
But what if I am?
I'm the last male Kramer.</i>

93
00:04:30,409 --> 00:04:32,047
We're facing extinction.</i>

94
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:34,439
Go to a fertility clinic,
check your sperm count.</i>

95
00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:37,077
Yeah, but then I'd have to-
Well, you know...</i>

96
00:04:37,249 --> 00:04:39,968
Into a cup in the middle of the day?</i>

97
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:42,689
What, does that conflict
with your regular schedule?</i>

98
00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:49,000
All right, I'm gonna try
Noreen again.</i>

99
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:52,798
I am very excited about this date.
We're going to Hunan Balcony.</i>

100
00:04:52,969 --> 00:04:55,802
She's Chinese,
so you suggest Chinese food?</i>

101
00:04:55,969 --> 00:04:58,642
- She suggested it.
- I thought Chinese don't eat Chinese.</i>

102
00:04:58,809 --> 00:05:01,243
She's very assimilated.</i>

103
00:05:01,929 --> 00:05:03,203
Helo.</i>

104
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:08,524
- Paul again?
- You can't get one ring past him.</i>

105
00:05:09,649 --> 00:05:12,447
- Hey, hey. You don't call me back?
- I tried.</i>

106
00:05:12,609 --> 00:05:14,440
Your line's crossed
with a Chinese woman.</i>

107
00:05:15,569 --> 00:05:19,562
Hey, George, we saw your father
on the street before.</i>

108
00:05:19,729 --> 00:05:22,118
What's he doing in the city today?</i>

109
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:23,961
You didn't ask him?

110
00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:29,482
- You didn't say hello?
- Well, he was with someone...</i>

111
00:05:29,649 --> 00:05:32,846
...a man in a cape.</i>

112
00:05:33,969 --> 00:05:35,527
Why was he wearing a cape?</i>

113
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:40,603
Was my father wearing a cape?</i>

114
00:05:40,769 --> 00:05:42,760
No, jacket and tie. No cape.</i>

115
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:46,003
A cape.</i>

116
00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:50,879
What was a man with a cape
doing with my father?</i>

117
00:05:51,049 --> 00:05:54,246
What was my father doing
with a man in a cape?</i>

118
00:05:55,729 --> 00:05:57,879
Why a cape?</i>

119
00:06:04,409 --> 00:06:06,604
The results of your sperm test
are in.</i>

120
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:10,519
Are you planning to start a family?</i>

121
00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:14,128
Yes, I would like to very much.</i>

122
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:16,086
I'm low, aren't I? I can feel it.</i>

123
00:06:16,689 --> 00:06:20,682
- Yes, I'm afraid you're a little low.
- Oh, man!</i>

124
00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:22,881
It's over.
The Kramer name is finished.</i>

125
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,882
- I'm never gonna procreate, huh?
- That's not necessarily true.</i>

126
00:06:26,049 --> 00:06:28,438
There are measures you can take
to improve fertility.</i>

127
00:06:28,609 --> 00:06:31,840
All right, what? What? You tell me.
I'll do anything. Come on, tell me.</i>

128
00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:35,399
First thing,
you should wear boxer shorts.</i>

129
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:38,805
- All the time?
- All the time.</i>

130
00:06:38,969 --> 00:06:41,005
You have to get off Jockeys
right away.</i>

131
00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:43,729
But I've always worn Jockeys.</i>

132
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:50,846
Hi, Paul, it's Elaine calling.</i>

133
00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:54,319
Yeah, I'm calling from a car phone,
so I don't really have time to talk.</i>

134
00:06:54,489 --> 00:06:56,684
Is Noreen there?</i>

135
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:58,123
She's not? Okay, great.</i>

136
00:06:58,289 --> 00:07:00,484
Well, you can just tell her
I called then, and-</i>

137
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:06,885
Well, yes, it has been
unseasonably cool lately.</i>

138
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:12,682
Okay. Well, look, I'm pulling up
to the building now, so I'm gonna...</i>

139
00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:16,327
Yeah, I tip 20 percent too.</i>

140
00:07:18,489 --> 00:07:21,959
Lookit, Paul, the car seems to be
running out of gas...</i>

141
00:07:22,129 --> 00:07:25,804
...so I'm gonna have
to get off the phone.</i>

142
00:07:27,569 --> 00:07:29,958
Please let me know
when your party has arrived.</i>

143
00:07:30,129 --> 00:07:32,040
Yes, I will.</i>

144
00:07:33,209 --> 00:07:34,881
- You mind?
- No, go ahead.</i>

145
00:07:35,049 --> 00:07:37,483
I secondhand smoke
two packs a day.</i>

146
00:07:38,769 --> 00:07:40,441
Jerry.</i>

147
00:07:41,209 --> 00:07:43,882
- Excuse me?
- Hi, sorry I'm late.</i>

148
00:07:44,049 --> 00:07:46,688
- Who are you?
- I'm Donna Chang.</i>

149
00:07:49,089 --> 00:07:50,442
What do you mean?</i>

150
00:07:50,609 --> 00:07:52,645
I mean I'm Donna Chang.</i>

151
00:07:53,569 --> 00:07:57,323
- You're Donna Chang?
- Did you think I was Chinese?</i>

152
00:07:58,409 --> 00:08:00,684
No. What, you mean
because of the "Chang"?</i>

153
00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:02,919
The family name
wasn't originally Chang.</i>

154
00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:05,159
- I didn't think so.
- Used to be Changstein.</i>

155
00:08:07,969 --> 00:08:11,245
- She's not Chinese?
- No, not Chinese.</i>

156
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:13,322
Not even Asian.</i>

157
00:08:13,849 --> 00:08:17,444
- So, what is she?
- Well, she's like you.</i>

158
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:21,322
Oh, how disappointed
you must have been.</i>

159
00:08:22,409 --> 00:08:24,047
Well, it's false advertising, see?</i>

160
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:27,679
And the thing is, I think she likes
people thinking she's Chinese.</i>

161
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:29,441
She suggests Chinese food...</i>

162
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:31,804
...she always introduces herself
as Donna Chang.</i>

163
00:08:32,369 --> 00:08:35,964
- So why are you seeing her again?
- Well, she is a woman.</i>

164
00:08:36,129 --> 00:08:39,246
Listen, I spoke to Paul and Noreen.
They might be breaking up.</i>

165
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:41,561
- Really?
- Well, maybe.</i>

166
00:08:43,249 --> 00:08:45,809
Hey, wouldn't it be funny
if Paul and Noreen broke up...</i>

167
00:08:45,969 --> 00:08:47,766
...because you kept
hanging up on him?</i>

168
00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:52,167
- What do you mean?
- If Paul thought it was some guy...</i>

169
00:08:52,329 --> 00:08:55,526
...hanging up because he was
having an affair with Noreen.</i>

170
00:08:58,729 --> 00:09:00,003
Here, take my Jockey shorts.</i>

171
00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:02,362
Hey, what is that?</i>

172
00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:05,646
Look, you gotta help me.
I have to get off Jockey shorts.</i>

173
00:09:05,809 --> 00:09:07,959
- What, you have low sperm count?
- Very low.</i>

174
00:09:08,129 --> 00:09:09,926
- Come on, take them.
- I don't want them.</i>

175
00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:13,638
Jerry, look, you gotta help. If I have
one pair in my house, I'll wear them.</i>

176
00:09:13,809 --> 00:09:16,004
- I don't want them.
- All it takes is one pair.</i>

177
00:09:16,169 --> 00:09:18,763
I'm not gonna be able to sleep
if those are in the house.</i>

178
00:09:18,929 --> 00:09:20,647
Boxers! How do you
wear these things?</i>

179
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:23,243
Look at that. They're bagging up.
They're rising here.</i>

180
00:09:23,409 --> 00:09:26,526
And there's nothing holding me
in place. I'm flipping, I'm flopping.</i>

181
00:09:29,129 --> 00:09:30,721
What am I gonna do?

182
00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:33,881
Jerry, I'm going crazy
in these things.</i>

183
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:42,442
Well, I'm gonna have to move now.</i>

184
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:46,286
You know what I like
about Manhattan?</i>

185
00:09:47,369 --> 00:09:48,882
There's no mosquitoes.</i>

186
00:09:49,049 --> 00:09:50,368
There's plenty of mosquitoes.</i>

187
00:09:51,609 --> 00:09:53,201
Queens is full of mosquitoes.</i>

188
00:09:53,369 --> 00:09:57,647
- So, Dad-
- Gnats too, if I'm not mistaken.</i>

189
00:10:01,009 --> 00:10:02,840
Heard you were in the city
the other day.</i>

190
00:10:03,009 --> 00:10:06,524
Your mother has to tell you
every move I make? I'll kill her.</i>

191
00:10:08,289 --> 00:10:11,008
- Jerry and Elaine saw you.
- They didn't say hello?</i>

192
00:10:11,169 --> 00:10:14,047
- They were in a rush.
- They couldn't just say hello?</i>

193
00:10:14,209 --> 00:10:16,120
The hell with them.</i>

194
00:10:16,689 --> 00:10:20,762
They said you were with some guy
who was wearing a cape.</i>

195
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:23,079
Elaine, I can see not saying hello.</i>

196
00:10:23,249 --> 00:10:26,605
She's very-
What's the word? Supercilious.</i>

197
00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:30,205
- So, Dad-
- How could Jerry not say hello?</i>

198
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:36,842
- Did they uncross the lines yet?
- They can't find the problem.</i>

199
00:10:37,009 --> 00:10:38,283
It's getting ridicurous.</i>

200
00:10:59,049 --> 00:11:01,244
Did you say "ridicurous"?

201
00:11:01,409 --> 00:11:02,922
Ridiculous.

202
00:11:04,969 --> 00:11:07,039
I thought you said...

203
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:08,927
...ridicurous.

204
00:11:12,329 --> 00:11:13,648
Hey, what are you doing here?</i>

205
00:11:13,809 --> 00:11:16,198
I wanted to talk to you.
Didn't know you had company.</i>

206
00:11:16,369 --> 00:11:18,121
- Oh, no, no.
- Hi, I'm George.</i>

207
00:11:18,289 --> 00:11:21,167
Oh, hi. I'm Donna Chang.

208
00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:25,646
I just spoke to your mother before.</i>

209
00:11:26,329 --> 00:11:29,446
- You spoke to my mother?
- She was trying to call you, but-</i>

210
00:11:29,609 --> 00:11:31,327
The rines are crossed.</i>

211
00:11:33,249 --> 00:11:35,080
Did you say the "rines"
are crossed?</i>

212
00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:37,761
Did I?

213
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:41,442
George, she's so sweet.
We talked for an hour.</i>

214
00:11:41,609 --> 00:11:43,327
Anyway, I'm really sorry.</i>

215
00:11:43,489 --> 00:11:45,957
Sorry? Why sorry?
What do you have to be sorry about?</i>

216
00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:49,326
Well, she told me she and your father
are getting divorced.</i>

217
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:06,485
Boy, divorced. That's really too bad.</i>

218
00:12:06,649 --> 00:12:08,560
Yeah. You know,
it's a shame his parents...</i>

219
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:11,289
...didn't get divorced 30 years ago.</i>

220
00:12:11,849 --> 00:12:13,965
He could've been normal.</i>

221
00:12:14,129 --> 00:12:15,767
Oh, my God!

222
00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:18,967
You know what I just realized?</i>

223
00:12:19,129 --> 00:12:21,723
If they get divorced
and live in two separate places...</i>

224
00:12:21,889 --> 00:12:23,959
...that's twice as many visits.</i>

225
00:12:24,129 --> 00:12:25,448
I never thought of that.</i>

226
00:12:25,609 --> 00:12:27,884
Imagine if I had to see them both
on the same day.</i>

227
00:12:28,049 --> 00:12:30,609
It's like running a double marathon.</i>

228
00:12:31,489 --> 00:12:34,720
Hey, Georgie, did you have any idea
that anything was wrong?</i>

229
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:37,767
Have you ever spent any time
with these people?</i>

230
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,079
- You know what this has to do with?
- What?

231
00:12:42,249 --> 00:12:45,525
The man in the cape.
I bet you he is mixed up in this.</i>

232
00:12:46,289 --> 00:12:48,166
I don't trust men in capes.</i>

233
00:12:48,329 --> 00:12:50,126
You can't cast
aspersions on someone...</i>

234
00:12:50,289 --> 00:12:52,200
...just because
they're wearing a cape.</i>

235
00:12:52,369 --> 00:12:54,564
Superman wore a cape.</i>

236
00:12:54,729 --> 00:12:56,924
And I'll be damned
if I'm gonna stand here...</i>

237
00:12:57,089 --> 00:12:59,205
...and let you say
something bad about him.</i>

238
00:12:59,889 --> 00:13:01,845
All right, Superman's the exception.</i>

239
00:13:05,329 --> 00:13:08,127
Hey, Elaine, I heard that
Noreen and Paul are breaking up.</i>

240
00:13:08,289 --> 00:13:11,565
I want you to put in a good word
for me. Always had a thing for Noreen.</i>

241
00:13:11,729 --> 00:13:14,448
No, Kramer, you don't understand,
this could be my fault.</i>

242
00:13:14,609 --> 00:13:18,568
Well, if she's available, I won't let
her slip through my fingers this time.</i>

243
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:23,239
Well, looks like you've adjusted
to the boxers.</i>

244
00:13:23,409 --> 00:13:25,161
Well, I wouldn't go as far as that.</i>

245
00:13:25,329 --> 00:13:28,207
- You went back to the Jockeys?
- Wrong again.</i>

246
00:13:29,569 --> 00:13:31,446
Oh, no.

247
00:13:35,169 --> 00:13:37,125
What? What?

248
00:13:37,289 --> 00:13:39,962
Don't you see
what's going on here?</i>

249
00:13:40,489 --> 00:13:42,445
No boxers, no Jockeys.</i>

250
00:13:46,049 --> 00:13:49,962
The only thing between him and us
is a thin layer of gabardine.</i>

251
00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:53,080
- Kramer, say it isn't so.
- Oh, it be so.</i>

252
00:13:54,729 --> 00:13:58,517
I'm out there, Jerry,
and I'm loving every minute of it!</i>

253
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:04,327
Don't you need a little help?</i>

254
00:14:04,489 --> 00:14:05,717
Surprisingly, no.

255
00:14:05,889 --> 00:14:07,720
I'm free. I'm unfettered.</i>

256
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:13,719
I feel like a naked, innocent boy
roaming the countryside.</i>

257
00:14:15,489 --> 00:14:17,878
So you guys are trying to work it out.
That's great.</i>

258
00:14:18,049 --> 00:14:22,247
Yeah, well, we're trying, but he
just went insane there for a while.</i>

259
00:14:22,409 --> 00:14:24,047
He went insane?</i>

260
00:14:24,209 --> 00:14:25,642
Believe it or not...</i>

261
00:14:25,809 --> 00:14:27,925
...Paul was convinced
I was having an affair...</i>

262
00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:31,081
...because somebody kept calling
and hanging up when he answered.</i>

263
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:36,446
What kind of a sick person calls
and hangs up over and over?</i>

264
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,600
Well...</i>

265
00:14:38,769 --> 00:14:40,361
...I don't know about sick.

266
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:43,407
I mean, maybe it was somebody...</i>

267
00:14:43,569 --> 00:14:46,163
...who didn't wanna talk
to whoever was answering...</i>

268
00:14:46,329 --> 00:14:49,878
...because whoever was answering
was always making boring chit-chat...</i>

269
00:14:50,049 --> 00:14:52,199
...and was completely oblivious
to the fact...</i>

270
00:14:52,369 --> 00:14:56,681
...that the person who was calling
didn't wanna speak to them.</i>

271
00:14:59,929 --> 00:15:03,683
I can't believe that was you.</i>

272
00:15:04,049 --> 00:15:06,199
I'm really sorry, Noreen.</i>

273
00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:09,398
So you thought he was boring?</i>

274
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:12,646
Hey, Noreen, don't go by me.</i>

275
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,802
What are you doing to this woman?</i>

276
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:20,919
This is the second relationship
you've ruined for her in a few weeks.</i>

277
00:15:21,809 --> 00:15:23,800
- I know.
- First you ruin her relationship...</i>

278
00:15:23,969 --> 00:15:26,483
- ... with the high-talker.
- Well, I got confused.</i>

279
00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:28,207
They sound exactly the same.</i>

280
00:15:28,369 --> 00:15:29,722
So she breaks up with him.</i>

281
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:31,959
Somehow picks up
the pieces of her life...</i>

282
00:15:32,129 --> 00:15:35,087
...miraculously meets a new guy.</i>

283
00:15:35,249 --> 00:15:37,558
You bust that up.

284
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:41,927
And then just as they're reconciling,
you announce to the world...</i>

285
00:15:42,089 --> 00:15:44,603
...he's boring.</i>

286
00:15:45,609 --> 00:15:47,565
I didn't know she'd take it
so seriously.</i>

287
00:15:47,729 --> 00:15:50,448
Apparently, you have a tremendous
influence over this woman.</i>

288
00:15:50,609 --> 00:15:52,679
Anything you say, she does.</i>

289
00:15:54,689 --> 00:15:56,088
- Yeah?
- It's Donna Chang.</i>

290
00:15:56,249 --> 00:15:59,446
- Come up.
- I guess I just didn't realize it.</i>

291
00:15:59,609 --> 00:16:02,043
Well, let's look back at your history
with this woman.</i>

292
00:16:02,209 --> 00:16:04,120
- Okay?
- Okay.

293
00:16:04,289 --> 00:16:08,362
First, you encouraged her
to join the Army.</i>

294
00:16:09,489 --> 00:16:10,763
She did.</i>

295
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:12,521
She was lost.</i>

296
00:16:12,689 --> 00:16:15,681
Then you suggest she goes AWOL.</i>

297
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:18,363
She did.</i>

298
00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:20,520
She didn't seem
to be having so much fun.</i>

299
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:23,886
Make sure you never tell this woman
to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge.</i>

300
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:26,927
If I have this much influence,
I'll call her and tell her...</i>

301
00:16:27,089 --> 00:16:28,807
...to get back together with him.</i>

302
00:16:29,329 --> 00:16:31,160
- Hey.
- Oh, Miss Changstein.</i>

303
00:16:31,329 --> 00:16:32,603
- This is Elaine.
- Hello.</i>

304
00:16:32,769 --> 00:16:34,043
Hi. How are you?</i>

305
00:16:34,209 --> 00:16:36,040
Guess what?
Mrs. Costanza called me.</i>

306
00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:38,723
- They're not getting divorced.
- Why, what happened?</i>

307
00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:41,403
She was trying to call George
last night, she got me...</i>

308
00:16:41,569 --> 00:16:43,560
...we spoke an hour,
and changed her mind.</i>

309
00:16:43,729 --> 00:16:46,243
- Wow, that's amazing.
- Anyway, she wants to meet me.</i>

310
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:48,798
She invited me for dinner.
Said you should come too.</i>

311
00:16:48,969 --> 00:16:50,038
- Tonight?
- Yeah.</i>

312
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:54,122
I just remembered. I'm gonna have
to cancel my acupuncture class.</i>

313
00:17:01,769 --> 00:17:03,839
All right, let me just say one thing.</i>

314
00:17:04,009 --> 00:17:06,443
There is no way that this
is gonna happen. No way!</i>

315
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:09,043
Because if you think
I'm going to two Thanksgivings...</i>

316
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:10,562
...you're out of your mind!</i>

317
00:17:10,769 --> 00:17:13,806
- We're not getting divorced.
- Your mother changed her mind.</i>

318
00:17:13,969 --> 00:17:16,927
You did? That's good.
That's very good.</i>

319
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:19,478
- I'm very glad to hear that.
- Yeah. We worked it out.</i>

320
00:17:19,649 --> 00:17:22,607
All right, let me ask a question.
Who was the man in the cape?</i>

321
00:17:22,769 --> 00:17:25,806
- He was my lawyer.
- Your lawyer wears a cape?</i>

322
00:17:25,969 --> 00:17:27,641
Yeah. So what?</i>

323
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:30,369
- Who wears a cape?
- He's very independent.</i>

324
00:17:30,529 --> 00:17:32,042
He doesn't follow the trends.</i>

325
00:17:32,689 --> 00:17:34,919
He looks ridiculous in that thing.</i>

326
00:17:35,089 --> 00:17:36,363
You have no eye for fashion!</i>

327
00:17:36,529 --> 00:17:38,918
- I have no eye for fashion?
- All right.</i>

328
00:17:39,089 --> 00:17:42,445
Come on. Let's not fight.</i>

329
00:17:42,609 --> 00:17:44,327
- All right, all right.
- All right.

330
00:17:44,489 --> 00:17:46,366
Georgie's right.</i>

331
00:17:47,529 --> 00:17:49,281
So, what made you change
your mind?</i>

332
00:17:49,449 --> 00:17:52,521
It was that Chinese woman.</i>

333
00:17:54,369 --> 00:17:56,929
What did you tell Mrs. Costanza
that changed her mind?</i>

334
00:17:57,089 --> 00:17:59,728
Mentioned a few bits of wisdom
from Confucius.</i>

335
00:17:59,889 --> 00:18:02,449
- Confucius, huh?
- Yeah.</i>

336
00:18:02,969 --> 00:18:05,483
You know, you're not Chinese.</i>

337
00:18:09,729 --> 00:18:11,048
Hey, I heard the good news.</i>

338
00:18:11,209 --> 00:18:14,485
Jerry, how come you didn't
say hello to me the other day?</i>

339
00:18:14,649 --> 00:18:17,800
- Elaine was in a rush.
- I knew it was Elaine.</i>

340
00:18:19,209 --> 00:18:20,688
You must be Estelle.</i>

341
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:23,682
- Yes. Who are you?
- I'm Donna Chang.</i>

342
00:18:24,329 --> 00:18:26,445
You're not Chinese.</i>

343
00:18:29,849 --> 00:18:31,077
Hello?</i>

344
00:18:31,249 --> 00:18:33,001
- Paul?
- Elaine.</i>

345
00:18:33,209 --> 00:18:35,040
Kramer?</i>

346
00:18:35,209 --> 00:18:37,086
Yeah!</i>

347
00:18:38,609 --> 00:18:41,407
- What are you doing there?
- Well, isn't it obvious?</i>

348
00:18:43,249 --> 00:18:46,446
- Is Noreen there?
- Yes, she is.</i>

349
00:18:46,609 --> 00:18:49,169
Well, can I talk to her?</i>

350
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:51,559
What, am I too boring for you?

351
00:18:52,209 --> 00:18:53,927
All right. Would you just put her on?</i>

352
00:18:54,089 --> 00:18:57,240
I feel it would be best that
you didn't talk to Noreen for a while.</i>

353
00:18:57,409 --> 00:18:59,240
- You feel?
- That's right.</i>

354
00:18:59,409 --> 00:19:01,479
She and I have had a very long talk.</i>

355
00:19:01,649 --> 00:19:04,402
And I was appalled to learn
of the destructive influence...</i>

356
00:19:04,569 --> 00:19:08,528
...you've had over her life
lo these many years.</i>

357
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:12,443
- What, are you insane?
- From now on, I'll be calling the shots.</i>

358
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:14,848
And what are you gonna tell her?</i>

359
00:19:15,009 --> 00:19:18,285
Well, I've encouraged her
to go back into the Army.</i>

360
00:19:18,769 --> 00:19:22,284
There she'll get the structure
and discipline she needs right now.</i>

361
00:19:22,449 --> 00:19:26,522
And she'll have qualified officers
telling her what to do.</i>

362
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,968
Kramer, you have got
to let me talk to her.</i>

363
00:19:30,129 --> 00:19:32,120
Can't help you, kid.</i>

364
00:19:32,329 --> 00:19:34,843
- You're not Chinese?
- No.</i>

365
00:19:35,009 --> 00:19:37,648
- I thought you were Chinese.
- I'm from Long Island.</i>

366
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:39,401
Long Island?

367
00:19:39,569 --> 00:19:42,606
I thought I was getting advice
from a Chinese woman.</i>

368
00:19:42,769 --> 00:19:45,647
- I'm sorry.
- Well, then...</i>

369
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:49,006
- ... that changes everything.
- What?</i>

370
00:19:49,169 --> 00:19:52,241
She's not Chinese. I was duped!</i>

371
00:19:53,249 --> 00:19:56,525
So what? She still gave you advice.
What's the difference?</i>

372
00:19:56,689 --> 00:20:00,204
I'm not taking advice
from some girl from Long Island.</i>

373
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:03,401
Now you're getting a divorce
because she's from Long Island?</i>

374
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:06,527
You want a divorce? You got one!</i>

375
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:11,246
You know, you might wanna think
about changing your name.</i>

376
00:20:11,729 --> 00:20:14,448
Ever since she started dating Kramer,
she won't talk to me.</i>

377
00:20:14,609 --> 00:20:15,928
Noreen listened to you...</i>

378
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:18,649
...like George's mother
listens to the Chinese.</i>

379
00:20:18,809 --> 00:20:22,358
Everybody listens to the Chinese.
Look at the fortune cookie.</i>

380
00:20:22,529 --> 00:20:24,360
You couldn't get away with that
at other restaurants.</i>

381
00:20:24,529 --> 00:20:27,248
Yeah, no one's reading any
rolled up messages in a knish.</i>

382
00:20:28,809 --> 00:20:32,688
Well, it had to happen.
I knew it. I predicted it.</i>

383
00:20:33,409 --> 00:20:35,877
Saw both of them today.
What a disaster.</i>

384
00:20:36,729 --> 00:20:38,287
I'm running all over Queens.</i>

385
00:20:38,449 --> 00:20:40,519
First, I saw my mother.
We had lunch together.</i>

386
00:20:40,689 --> 00:20:43,487
I never had lunch with
my mother before. It's like a date.</i>

387
00:20:43,649 --> 00:20:46,766
Then we drive down to Kew Gardens,
tons of traffic, I see my father.</i>

388
00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:48,567
We played Clue.</i>

389
00:20:48,729 --> 00:20:49,957
All day with this!

390
00:20:50,129 --> 00:20:52,040
Hey, Jerry! Guess what?</i>

391
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:54,404
The Kramer name might live on!</i>

392
00:20:54,569 --> 00:20:55,922
Noreen's late!</i>

393
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:58,887
She's late!</i>

394
00:21:23,889 --> 00:21:26,722
- Who are you?
- I'm Frank Costanza's lawyer.</i>

395
