1
00:00:03,649 --> 00:00:06,243
I never figured out why
they make these bizarre toilet seats.</i>

2
00:00:06,409 --> 00:00:10,197
You know? Like those clear Lucite
ones with all the coins in it?</i>

3
00:00:10,369 --> 00:00:13,998
It's a lovely tribute to our
past president. It's not bad enough...</i>

4
00:00:14,169 --> 00:00:18,685
...Lincoln got shot in the head, we
gotta drop our pants and sit on it too.</i>

5
00:00:19,089 --> 00:00:22,525
It's just incomprehensible
that you would buy a thing like this.</i>

6
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:26,045
You install it on your toilet seat.
And this says what about you?</i>

7
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:30,806
I can't afford to throw money down
the toilet, but look how close I am.</i>

8
00:00:37,849 --> 00:00:41,558
I cannot believe Lindsay's seeing you
after that Breakfast at Tiffany's thing.</i>

9
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:43,481
I think she finds
my stupidity charming.</i>

10
00:00:44,409 --> 00:00:45,888
- As we all do.
- Yeah.</i>

11
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:49,644
Anyway, she's having some kind
of a family lunch. I'll swing by after.</i>

12
00:00:49,809 --> 00:00:52,403
- So you gonna meet the mother?
- I'll zip in."How do you do?"</i>

13
00:00:52,569 --> 00:00:55,129
- Zip out. She'll love me.
- You're good with the mothers.</i>

14
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:58,440
You know, I'm better with the mothers
than I am with the daughters.</i>

15
00:00:58,609 --> 00:01:01,567
- Maybe you should date the mothers.
- If I could talk to the mothers...</i>

16
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:05,722
...and have sex with the daughters,
then I'd really have something going.</i>

17
00:01:05,889 --> 00:01:07,481
- You've got something going.
- Yeah.</i>

18
00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:09,243
- Hey.
- Hey.</i>

19
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:11,479
- You got a hammer?
- What do you need a hammer for?</i>

20
00:01:11,649 --> 00:01:14,527
I got this new poster, 3-D art.
Computers generate it.</i>

21
00:01:14,689 --> 00:01:17,328
- Yeah, I wanna see that. Bring it over.
- I don't have it now.</i>

22
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:20,447
I gotta pick it up at Mr. Pitt's.
Elaine was framing stuff for him...</i>

23
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:22,440
...so she did me a favour.
Wanna take a ride?</i>

24
00:01:22,609 --> 00:01:25,601
- No, I don't think so.
- George, you wanna go for a ride?</i>

25
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:27,327
- No.
- Oh, come on!</i>

26
00:01:27,489 --> 00:01:30,447
Could you wait until the man
finishes...?</i>

27
00:01:30,969 --> 00:01:32,482
All right, I've had it with you two.</i>

28
00:01:32,649 --> 00:01:34,879
Hey, guess what? Remember that
woman you saw me with?</i>

29
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:36,687
She used to be
an Olympic gymnast.</i>

30
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:39,318
- A gymnast?
- Yeah. She's Romanian.</i>

31
00:01:39,489 --> 00:01:41,480
She won a silver
at the '84 Olympics.</i>

32
00:01:41,649 --> 00:01:44,925
A gymnast, Jerry.
Think of the flexibility.</i>

33
00:01:45,289 --> 00:01:47,086
That sex will melt your face.</i>

34
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:51,726
- Yeah, well, I think I'm bailing.
- Bailing?</i>

35
00:01:51,889 --> 00:01:55,245
Kramer, there's always a price
to pay for just a sexual dalliance.</i>

36
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:57,479
Jerry, you should pay that price.</i>

37
00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:01,558
She's Romanian. What will I talk
to her about? Ceausescu?</i>

38
00:02:01,929 --> 00:02:03,487
Ch- What?

39
00:02:05,089 --> 00:02:09,401
Gymnast? I can't believe it.
You didn't tell me she was a gymnast.</i>

40
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:11,562
What is this?

41
00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:15,801
I'm putting my shirt back on.

42
00:02:21,089 --> 00:02:23,762
Back on? What was it doing off?

43
00:02:24,369 --> 00:02:28,760
I take it off when I go to the...
You know, to the office.</i>

44
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:31,799
What for?

45
00:02:31,969 --> 00:02:34,483
Frees me up, no encumbrances.</i>

46
00:02:35,249 --> 00:02:38,605
- Unbuttoned or all the way off?
- All the way, baby.</i>

47
00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:40,487
Of course.</i>

48
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:44,283
Again? Kramer, if you keep
getting these attacks...</i>

49
00:02:44,449 --> 00:02:46,679
...you should see the doctor
and have it checked out.</i>

50
00:02:46,849 --> 00:02:48,407
Yeah, yeah.</i>

51
00:02:49,729 --> 00:02:52,118
- You always take the shirt off?
- Always.</i>

52
00:02:52,289 --> 00:02:55,008
I tell you, knowing you is like going
into the jungle.</i>

53
00:02:55,169 --> 00:02:58,844
I never know what I'm gonna find next,
and I'm real scared.</i>

54
00:03:00,969 --> 00:03:04,279
Elaine, I need you to proofread
this report for my meeting...</i>

55
00:03:04,449 --> 00:03:06,838
...with the Poland Creek
bottled-water people.</i>

56
00:03:07,009 --> 00:03:08,761
- What meeting?
- I told you.</i>

57
00:03:08,929 --> 00:03:11,318
I sit on the board of trustees
for Morgan Springs...</i>

58
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:13,957
...and we're trying to acquire
Poland Creek.</i>

59
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:18,643
Are you using a fountain pen?</i>

60
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,485
- Yes.
- They smear.</i>

61
00:03:21,649 --> 00:03:25,437
Under no circumstances is ink
to be used in this office.</i>

62
00:03:26,409 --> 00:03:30,527
All right, I'll use a pencil, Mr. Pitt.</i>

63
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:34,043
- Elaine.
- Come in. Come in.</i>

64
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:36,006
Yeah.</i>

65
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:39,887
Hi, right there. Yeah.</i>

66
00:03:40,529 --> 00:03:42,645
- That's not it.
- Kramer, it's that-</i>

67
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:46,158
- There she blows.
- Kramer?</i>

68
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:49,242
Kramer, could you do this at home?
I don't think-</i>

69
00:03:50,409 --> 00:03:53,162
- I've got work to do, okay?
- These are nice corners.</i>

70
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:56,127
Elaine, did I hear-?
This is very odd.</i>

71
00:03:56,289 --> 00:04:00,282
Yeah, it's 3-D art. Computers
generate them, big computers.</i>

72
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:03,600
Yes, I've heard about these.
How do they work?</i>

73
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:06,727
You blur your eyes like you're staring
straight through the picture...</i>

74
00:04:06,889 --> 00:04:09,164
...and you keep
your eyes unfocused.</i>

75
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:10,842
Then...</i>

76
00:04:13,289 --> 00:04:14,961
Yeah!</i>

77
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:18,081
- I don't see it.
- It's a spaceship...</i>

78
00:04:18,249 --> 00:04:21,559
- ... surrounded by planets, asteroids.
- I still don't see it.</i>

79
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:24,880
Okay. Kramer, that's enough.
Mr. Pitt has got work to do.</i>

80
00:04:25,049 --> 00:04:26,482
You ever dream in 3-D?</i>

81
00:04:26,649 --> 00:04:28,685
It's like the bogeyman
is coming right at you.</i>

82
00:04:28,849 --> 00:04:30,521
- A spaceship, where?
- Right in here.</i>

83
00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:32,008
Just keep your eyes unfocused.</i>

84
00:04:33,929 --> 00:04:35,760
- Oh, Mama.
- Kramer, what's wrong?</i>

85
00:04:35,929 --> 00:04:38,682
- Mama.
- Kramer, are you okay?</i>

86
00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:41,602
I think I got to go to the doctor.
Oh, Mama!</i>

87
00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:44,563
How long does it usually take?</i>

88
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:54,843
George, it is so nice
to finally meet you.</i>

89
00:04:55,009 --> 00:04:57,239
And I'm sorry
we've kept Lindsay so long.</i>

90
00:04:57,409 --> 00:04:59,047
- Mother.
- No, no, not at all.</i>

91
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:02,201
I have always felt that the
most important thing in the world...</i>

92
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:04,041
...is spending time with family.</i>

93
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:06,487
Are you and your family close?</i>

94
00:05:07,089 --> 00:05:10,843
Very close. Almost painfully close.</i>

95
00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:14,320
Mother, I'm gonna walk Nana
and Aunt Phyllis to the elevator.</i>

96
00:05:14,489 --> 00:05:16,320
George, do you mind
waiting one more minute?</i>

97
00:05:16,489 --> 00:05:18,878
Mind? Why would I mind?
I would love to wait.</i>

98
00:05:19,049 --> 00:05:22,359
Nana, nice to see you.
Nana!</i>

99
00:05:22,769 --> 00:05:25,442
Aunt Phyllis, always a pleasure,
what a pleasure.</i>

100
00:05:25,609 --> 00:05:28,077
Hey, let's do this again real soon.
I had fun.</i>

101
00:05:28,249 --> 00:05:30,285
- Can I offer you anything to eat?
- No, I'm fine.</i>

102
00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:33,327
- Let me help you with these dishes.
- George, you don't have to.</i>

103
00:05:33,489 --> 00:05:36,049
No, I know I don't have to,
I want to.</i>

104
00:05:36,209 --> 00:05:40,282
George, you are such a gentleman.</i>

105
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:42,326
I'd argue if I could, Mrs. Enright.</i>

106
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,727
Here we go. All right.</i>

107
00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:10,280
Mrs. Enright!

108
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:11,882
Mrs. Enright!

109
00:06:12,529 --> 00:06:15,760
Look, there's a spaceship.
That is so cool.</i>

110
00:06:15,929 --> 00:06:17,726
Where is it?</i>

111
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:19,402
- Right here.
- I'm looking there!</i>

112
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:22,288
- No, no, unfocus.
- I am unfocused!</i>

113
00:06:26,369 --> 00:06:27,848
Hello?</i>

114
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:32,007
Oh, yeah. Okay, fine.
He'll be right down.</i>

115
00:06:32,169 --> 00:06:34,478
Car's here to pick you up
and take you to the meeting.</i>

116
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:36,367
Meeting?</i>

117
00:06:36,769 --> 00:06:38,919
The Poland Creek merger.</i>

118
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:43,801
- Why don't you go for me?
- How can I go?</i>

119
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:45,960
All they're gonna do
is read the report.</i>

120
00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:49,162
Mr. Pitt, I do not think
that is just such a good idea.</i>

121
00:06:49,329 --> 00:06:51,240
Oh, damn this thing!

122
00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:58,243
So Ceausescu,
he must have been some dictator.</i>

123
00:06:58,409 --> 00:07:02,038
Yes, he was not shy about dictating.</i>

124
00:07:02,329 --> 00:07:04,843
He must have been dictating
first thing in the morning.</i>

125
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:09,082
- I want a cup of coffee and a muffin.
- And you could not refuse.</i>

126
00:07:09,249 --> 00:07:11,319
No, you'd have to be crazy.</i>

127
00:07:12,289 --> 00:07:15,645
- He was a very bad dictator.
- Yes.</i>

128
00:07:16,049 --> 00:07:17,846
Very bad.</i>

129
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:20,645
Very, very bad.</i>

130
00:07:23,969 --> 00:07:26,608
So let me get this straight.
You find yourself in the kitchen.</i>

131
00:07:26,769 --> 00:07:29,841
You see an éclair
in the receptacle...</i>

132
00:07:30,369 --> 00:07:32,439
...and you think to yourself:</i>

133
00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:36,199
"What the hell,
I'll just eat some trash."</i>

134
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:41,082
No, no, no. It was not trash.

135
00:07:41,249 --> 00:07:42,921
- Was it in the trash?
- Yes.</i>

136
00:07:43,249 --> 00:07:44,841
Then it was trash.</i>

137
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:48,081
It wasn't down in.
It was sort of on top.

138
00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:51,407
- But it was in the cylinder.
- Above the rim.</i>

139
00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:54,208
Adjacent to refuse is refuse.</i>

140
00:07:54,369 --> 00:07:56,929
It was on a magazine,
and it still had the doily on.</i>

141
00:07:57,089 --> 00:08:00,001
- Was it eaten?
- One little bite.</i>

142
00:08:00,609 --> 00:08:03,567
Well, that's garbage.</i>

143
00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:07,599
But I know who took the bite.
It was her aunt.</i>

144
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:12,758
You, my friend, have crossed the line
that divides man and bum.</i>

145
00:08:12,929 --> 00:08:15,124
You are now a bum.</i>

146
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:17,847
Hey.</i>

147
00:08:18,369 --> 00:08:20,121
What's with you?

148
00:08:20,289 --> 00:08:22,041
I got a stone.</i>

149
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:25,404
- What stone?
- A kidney stone.</i>

150
00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:27,002
What is that, anyway?

151
00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:31,526
It's a stony mineral concretion...</i>

152
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:33,964
...formed abnormally in the kidney.</i>

153
00:08:34,129 --> 00:08:38,202
And this jagged shard of calcium
pushes its way through the ureter...</i>

154
00:08:38,369 --> 00:08:42,760
...into the bladder.
It's forced out through the urine.</i>

155
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:47,361
Boy, that's gotta hurt.

156
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:51,040
Our shareholders
have given basic approval...</i>

157
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:54,042
...for the merger,
including the stock swap.</i>

158
00:08:55,049 --> 00:08:58,803
The stock swap.
Let's swap some stock.</i>

159
00:08:59,569 --> 00:09:02,527
If you'll just give this to Mr. Pitt
and tell him that we expect...</i>

160
00:09:02,689 --> 00:09:05,044
...to be in full-scale production
by the spring.</i>

161
00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:07,564
All right. Hey, you guys,
what's the name...</i>

162
00:09:07,729 --> 00:09:11,005
- ... of the new company gonna be?
- Moland Spring.</i>

163
00:09:11,489 --> 00:09:13,366
- Moland?
- Yes.</i>

164
00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:15,804
We combined Morgan and Poland.</i>

165
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:19,481
Yeah, I know, but Moland?</i>

166
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:22,209
I wouldn't drink
anything called Moland.</i>

167
00:09:22,369 --> 00:09:23,882
But it was Mr. Pitt's idea.</i>

168
00:09:25,249 --> 00:09:29,879
Well, what's in a name?
I mean, water is water, right?</i>

169
00:09:30,049 --> 00:09:32,802
We've got to do something
about that name.</i>

170
00:09:33,289 --> 00:09:38,079
No, Lindsay, it was not in the garbage.
It was above the garbage.</i>

171
00:09:38,249 --> 00:09:41,002
Hovering like an angel.</i>

172
00:09:42,289 --> 00:09:46,601
Of course I know your aunt bit it.
I kissed her goodbye.</i>

173
00:09:47,569 --> 00:09:49,878
Listen, can I tell you something else?
In my family...</i>

174
00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:53,086
...we used to eat out of the garbage
all the time. It was no big thing.</i>

175
00:09:53,249 --> 00:09:55,809
That's right. Okay.

176
00:09:55,969 --> 00:09:58,961
Bye-bye. I'm back in.
She gave me a second chance.</i>

177
00:09:59,129 --> 00:10:00,926
- Good for you.
- Yes. Good for me.</i>

178
00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:03,887
You know what you should do now?
Get her flowers, smooth it out.</i>

179
00:10:04,049 --> 00:10:08,918
Yes. Flowers. I will get her flowers.
I will go to the florist.</i>

180
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:13,562
Behold, the games
of the '84 Olympiad.</i>

181
00:10:13,729 --> 00:10:17,802
- Katya's silver-medal performance.
- Kramer, you're still on this?</i>

182
00:10:17,969 --> 00:10:19,925
I've seen gymnasts.
I know what they do.</i>

183
00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:23,081
- It's not gonna make any difference.
- Jerry, what is your problem?</i>

184
00:10:23,249 --> 00:10:26,878
Kramer, you know,
guys like you with no conscience...</i>

185
00:10:27,049 --> 00:10:29,040
...don't know what it's like
for guys like me.</i>

186
00:10:29,209 --> 00:10:33,327
I'm in the unfortunate position of
having to consider people's feelings.</i>

187
00:10:33,489 --> 00:10:36,242
All right, Jerry, are you familiar
with the Kama Sutra?</i>

188
00:10:36,409 --> 00:10:37,888
- No.
- Tantric yoga.

189
00:10:38,049 --> 00:10:41,246
- No.
- Jerry, you stand on the threshold...</i>

190
00:10:41,409 --> 00:10:43,877
...to the magical world
of sensual delights...</i>

191
00:10:44,049 --> 00:10:46,927
...that most men dare not dream of.</i>

192
00:10:47,409 --> 00:10:49,365
Boy, you can really talk some trash.</i>

193
00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:51,724
I guess that's better than eating it.</i>

194
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:57,484
All right, why don't we just watch
the tape, huh?</i>

195
00:10:58,689 --> 00:11:01,123
- Did you pass your stone yet?
- Not yet.</i>

196
00:11:01,569 --> 00:11:04,129
But the suspense is killing me.</i>

197
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:06,519
- Hey, that's her.
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, that's her.</i>

198
00:11:06,689 --> 00:11:09,044
Look at the height, Jerry,
the extension.</i>

199
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:11,962
Watch the tuck,
handstand, half turn...</i>

200
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:14,563
...giant into a straddle,
back into another handstand...</i>

201
00:11:14,729 --> 00:11:16,799
...nice kip, reverse hecht.</i>

202
00:11:16,969 --> 00:11:18,960
Nice leg extension. Good form.</i>

203
00:11:19,129 --> 00:11:21,484
Here comes the big dismount.
Look at the rotation.</i>

204
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:25,324
Full in, double back,
and she sticks the landing.</i>

205
00:11:30,369 --> 00:11:32,564
Perhaps you'd like to keep the tape.</i>

206
00:11:33,489 --> 00:11:35,684
I'll take that as a yes.</i>

207
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:40,723
Well, here we are.</i>

208
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:44,641
Yes, we are here.</i>

209
00:11:45,769 --> 00:11:49,808
How did you stay on that beam
like that? It's only this wide.</i>

210
00:11:50,369 --> 00:11:53,281
I can balance myself in any position.</i>

211
00:11:55,969 --> 00:12:00,565
It is amazing, after years of training,
how one can contort one's body.</i>

212
00:12:00,729 --> 00:12:05,359
Of course, it is only useful
in gymnastics.</i>

213
00:12:06,289 --> 00:12:07,927
Oh, boy.

214
00:12:13,329 --> 00:12:15,445
I couldn't believe it.
I thought I was entering...</i>

215
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:18,248
...a magical world
of sensual delights.</i>

216
00:12:18,409 --> 00:12:23,005
It was just so ordinary.
There was nothing gymnastic about it.</i>

217
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:25,401
What did you think
she was going to do?</i>

218
00:12:25,969 --> 00:12:29,006
You know, I mean... I don't know.</i>

219
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,641
No, what?

220
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:35,764
- Obviously, I prefer not mention any-
- Did you think she was gonna take...</i>

221
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:39,444
- ... some of that chalk and-
- I really don't wanna get into it.</i>

222
00:12:39,969 --> 00:12:42,802
- Oh, come on. One thing.
- You know, any kind of specifics.</i>

223
00:12:42,969 --> 00:12:44,721
One thing. What?</i>

224
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:51,638
Well, frankly, I thought, you know,
I was gonna be like the apparatus.</i>

225
00:12:55,049 --> 00:12:56,721
You mean like
the uneven parallel bars?</i>

226
00:12:56,889 --> 00:12:59,005
- Again, I don't feel like-
- The balance beam?</i>

227
00:12:59,169 --> 00:13:02,366
- Could we stop?
- Not the pommel horse.</i>

228
00:13:04,609 --> 00:13:05,962
Let's just drop it.</i>

229
00:13:07,609 --> 00:13:09,725
So let me ask you this.
How long would you say...</i>

230
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:14,121
...I have to put in now
because of, you know, last night?</i>

231
00:13:14,289 --> 00:13:17,361
- I don't know, at least three weeks.
- Oh, great.</i>

232
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:19,406
Jerry, that is such small potatoes.</i>

233
00:13:19,569 --> 00:13:22,959
I think that I may have
single-handedly put the kibosh...</i>

234
00:13:23,129 --> 00:13:26,326
- ... on the big water merger.
- Between Poland and Morgan?</i>

235
00:13:26,489 --> 00:13:28,764
Yeah. Started a big
name controversy.</i>

236
00:13:30,689 --> 00:13:32,441
Kramer. The stone.</i>

237
00:13:35,489 --> 00:13:37,081
What happened?
Did you pass the stone?</i>

238
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:41,242
No, I tried to do a reverse hecht
off my couch, and I didn't make it.</i>

239
00:13:49,969 --> 00:13:52,085
You call this coffee?</i>

240
00:13:52,689 --> 00:13:54,600
Hey!</i>

241
00:13:55,249 --> 00:13:56,568
What the hell was that?</i>

242
00:13:57,729 --> 00:13:59,799
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Clean that up!</i>

243
00:13:59,969 --> 00:14:02,005
Oh, sure. Of course.</i>

244
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,598
Could you hold these
for just a second?</i>

245
00:14:07,609 --> 00:14:09,406
Here you go.
Don't worry about a thing.</i>

246
00:14:09,569 --> 00:14:13,323
It's gonna be fine.
Here we go. Look at this shine.</i>

247
00:14:20,449 --> 00:14:22,519
Look at this sparkle.</i>

248
00:14:25,569 --> 00:14:28,288
Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!

249
00:14:29,249 --> 00:14:30,807
Mrs. Enright!

250
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:36,764
Lindsay, I had accidentally spilled
coffee on the gentleman's windshield.</i>

251
00:14:37,889 --> 00:14:40,881
Why would I do that? I have a job.</i>

252
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:43,838
Well, did she see a squeegee?</i>

253
00:14:45,169 --> 00:14:48,320
You're not gonna make
a dime without a squeegee.</i>

254
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:53,007
That's right. Just tell your mother
it was all a big misunderstanding.</i>

255
00:14:53,169 --> 00:14:54,841
You won't regret it.</i>

256
00:14:55,009 --> 00:14:57,239
Okay, I'll see you later.</i>

257
00:14:57,609 --> 00:14:59,406
Bye-bye.</i>

258
00:15:00,329 --> 00:15:02,285
Strike two.</i>

259
00:15:03,929 --> 00:15:07,080
- You think I'm going down?
- You're behind in the count.</i>

260
00:15:07,969 --> 00:15:11,757
- Hey, what are you doing later?
- Going out with Katya, thanks to you.</i>

261
00:15:11,929 --> 00:15:14,238
Well, you know,
maybe you should try again.</i>

262
00:15:14,409 --> 00:15:18,800
You know what happens the first time.
People are a little shy, a little reticent.</i>

263
00:15:18,969 --> 00:15:22,359
If I do it again, that extends
my payment book another two weeks.</i>

264
00:15:22,929 --> 00:15:24,362
- Where are you going?
- The circus.</i>

265
00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:26,520
One of her old Olympic team-mates
is an acrobat.</i>

266
00:15:26,689 --> 00:15:31,001
- I don't even feel like going out.
- Jerry, it's your obligation, come on.</i>

267
00:15:31,169 --> 00:15:33,888
Yeah, well, if I gotta go
and spend time with this girl...</i>

268
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:35,801
...you're coming with me,
Dr. Cyclops.</i>

269
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:38,847
- No, I don't wanna go to the circus.
- Yeah? Well, you're going.</i>

270
00:15:39,009 --> 00:15:41,239
But I'm afraid of clowns.

271
00:15:44,449 --> 00:15:47,282
I didn't send you over there
to complain about the name.</i>

272
00:15:47,449 --> 00:15:50,600
I couldn't help it. Moland Springs?</i>

273
00:15:50,769 --> 00:15:52,487
I like the name Moland.</i>

274
00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:54,128
I picked it out.</i>

275
00:15:54,289 --> 00:15:56,519
After all those months
of negotiating.</i>

276
00:15:56,689 --> 00:16:00,125
- Well, I'm so sorry.
- Well, I'm going riding.</i>

277
00:16:00,609 --> 00:16:03,407
I haven't been on Jenny
for three days.</i>

278
00:16:03,569 --> 00:16:06,208
All because of this blasted painting.</i>

279
00:16:06,689 --> 00:16:08,884
- Elaine?
- Oh, sorry.</i>

280
00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:12,368
Hello.</i>

281
00:16:13,969 --> 00:16:15,607
Wait a minute.</i>

282
00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:17,361
Wait a minute.</i>

283
00:16:33,049 --> 00:16:35,119
So, Jerry,
you're enjoying the circus?</i>

284
00:16:35,449 --> 00:16:37,087
Greatest show on earth.</i>

285
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:39,963
My father used to take me
to the circus.</i>

286
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:43,758
When the elephants came by,
he would scream curses at them...</i>

287
00:16:43,929 --> 00:16:47,365
...blaming them for all the ills
of society.</i>

288
00:16:48,729 --> 00:16:51,289
Well, they certainly take up
a lot of space.</i>

289
00:16:52,289 --> 00:16:54,678
- Misha.
- Katya.

290
00:16:55,329 --> 00:16:57,160
Misha, this is Jerry.</i>

291
00:16:57,849 --> 00:16:59,965
Yes, the comedian.</i>

292
00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:10,004
Oh, yes. Yes, I'll tell him.
Yes, thank you.</i>

293
00:17:10,169 --> 00:17:11,761
Hold on, hold on. Mr. Pitt?

294
00:17:11,929 --> 00:17:13,078
I think I'm on to something.</i>

295
00:17:13,249 --> 00:17:15,319
Mr. Pitt, the board of directors
is on the phone.</i>

296
00:17:15,489 --> 00:17:16,968
They've called
an emergency meeting.</i>

297
00:17:17,129 --> 00:17:18,926
You need to be there
to discuss the merger.</i>

298
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:21,557
You said keep your eyes out of focus,
which is misleading.</i>

299
00:17:21,729 --> 00:17:23,367
You want deep focus.</i>

300
00:17:23,529 --> 00:17:26,601
Yes, hi, okay. Fine. Yeah.
Hold on just a second. Let me just-</i>

301
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:28,960
Yeah, I've got it-</i>

302
00:17:31,489 --> 00:17:33,207
Yeah, he'll be there.</i>

303
00:17:33,409 --> 00:17:37,322
Mr. Pitt, you have got to stop
staring at that poster!</i>

304
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:41,084
I see something that could be a
spaceship. Is it round? Is it pointed?</i>

305
00:17:41,249 --> 00:17:44,207
No! You don't see it,
and you're never gonna see it!</i>

306
00:17:44,769 --> 00:17:48,205
Mr. Pitt, you have to meet with the
shareholders. You have to leave now.</i>

307
00:17:48,369 --> 00:17:51,600
Do you hear me?
Do you hear me?</i>

308
00:17:53,249 --> 00:17:55,160
My goodness.
What's happened to me?</i>

309
00:17:55,329 --> 00:17:57,081
- When's the meeting?
- In about 20 minutes.</i>

310
00:17:58,249 --> 00:17:59,568
Do I have time to change?</i>

311
00:18:00,449 --> 00:18:02,007
- No.
- Well, excuse me.</i>

312
00:18:02,169 --> 00:18:03,966
I better get straight over there.</i>

313
00:18:04,889 --> 00:18:06,447
- Mr. Pitt-
- Yes?</i>

314
00:18:06,929 --> 00:18:09,238
- There's a-
- Is that ink?</i>

315
00:18:10,049 --> 00:18:11,880
No.

316
00:18:15,649 --> 00:18:18,641
Well, here we are.</i>

317
00:18:20,729 --> 00:18:23,766
Do you wanna come in?
My mother's having a little party.</i>

318
00:18:24,209 --> 00:18:27,485
- Maybe I could just use the bathroom.
- Sure.</i>

319
00:18:29,169 --> 00:18:32,559
Ladies and gentlemen, may I direct
your attention to the centre ring...</i>

320
00:18:32,729 --> 00:18:35,163
...where the incomparable Misha
will balance 10 stories...</i>

321
00:18:35,329 --> 00:18:39,447
...above the circus floor on a wire
no wider than a human thumb.</i>

322
00:18:40,289 --> 00:18:41,563
It is time.</i>

323
00:18:43,329 --> 00:18:45,320
Break a leg.</i>

324
00:18:45,729 --> 00:18:48,163
- Show biz.
- Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

325
00:18:48,329 --> 00:18:51,082
...the incomparable Misha!</i>

326
00:18:52,929 --> 00:18:54,920
Those capes
are really coming back.</i>

327
00:18:58,369 --> 00:19:02,442
Sorry I took so long. They've got
one of those 3-D art posters in there.</i>

328
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:04,281
It's mesmerizing.</i>

329
00:19:38,089 --> 00:19:40,000
What is that sound?

330
00:19:40,209 --> 00:19:41,961
It is horrible.</i>

331
00:20:04,529 --> 00:20:07,441
Anybody see that poster in there?
That is weird, wild stuff, huh?</i>

332
00:20:21,209 --> 00:20:23,848
I have been accused
of wrongdoing...</i>

333
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:27,964
...but these false accusations
will not deter us.</i>

334
00:20:28,129 --> 00:20:32,088
We will annex Poland by the spring
at any cost!</i>

335
00:20:32,449 --> 00:20:36,078
And our stock will rise high.</i>

336
00:20:46,769 --> 00:20:49,567
The doctor said Misha
is going to be all right.</i>

337
00:20:49,729 --> 00:20:51,640
I must go and be with Misha now.</i>

338
00:20:51,809 --> 00:20:54,528
- I don't want you to come with me.
- Why not?</i>

339
00:20:54,689 --> 00:20:57,283
It has been three days
since our night together.</i>

340
00:20:57,449 --> 00:21:00,919
Misha said that was all the time
I needed to put in.</i>

341
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:05,248
- Really?
- In my country...</i>

342
00:21:05,409 --> 00:21:07,969
...they speak of a man so virile,
so potent...</i>

343
00:21:08,129 --> 00:21:11,166
...that to spend a night
with such a man is to enter a world...</i>

344
00:21:11,329 --> 00:21:15,447
...of sensual delights
most women dare not dream of.</i>

345
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:18,523
This man is known
as the comedian.</i>

346
00:21:20,329 --> 00:21:25,528
You may tell jokes, Mr. Jerry Seinfeld,
but you are no comedian.</i>
