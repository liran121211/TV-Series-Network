1
00:00:03,889 --> 00:00:06,039
<i>What's supposed to be
so attractive about fur?</i>

2
00:00:06,289 --> 00:00:08,564
<i>Why does a man
wanna see a woman in fur?</i>

3
00:00:08,729 --> 00:00:11,527
<i>Men want women with shaved legs
and armpits, plucked eyebrows.</i>

4
00:00:11,689 --> 00:00:14,283
<i>Then before we go out,
we dress them up like a bear?</i>

5
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:16,680
<i>To me, the only reason to wear fur...</i>

6
00:00:16,849 --> 00:00:19,647
<i>...would be if you were trying
to sneak up on another animal.</i>

7
00:00:19,809 --> 00:00:22,198
<i>You ever see those tribal hunters
wearing the fur...</i>

8
00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:25,918
<i>...with the other animal's head
on top of their head, you know?</i>

9
00:00:26,089 --> 00:00:29,126
<i>I'm sure there's a moose looking at
that going, "Yeah. Looks good.</i>

10
00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:33,202
<i>Yeah. I'm gonna turn my back
on this goofball with the extra head...</i>

11
00:00:33,369 --> 00:00:35,007
<i>...because nothing's
fishy there.</i>

12
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:36,966
<i>I'll just keep drinking
from the stream.</i>

13
00:00:37,129 --> 00:00:40,405
<i>I've seen a lot of two-headed
tigers with knees."</i>

14
00:00:43,889 --> 00:00:46,528
<i>So I am actually gonna have
a secretary.</i>

15
00:00:46,689 --> 00:00:48,839
<i>- I get to do the interview.
- It's incredible.</i>

16
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:50,806
<i>You were taking messages
for your mother.</i>

17
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:53,358
<i>And now someone's gonna be
taking messages for me.</i>

18
00:00:53,529 --> 00:00:55,804
<i>From your mother.</i>

19
00:00:55,969 --> 00:00:58,119
So this woman you plan on hiring...

20
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:00,598
<i>...is she gonna be
in the spokesmodel category?</i>

21
00:01:01,489 --> 00:01:03,320
<i>Sure, I could go the tomato route...</i>

22
00:01:03,489 --> 00:01:05,559
<i>...but I've given this
a lot of thought, Jerry.</i>

23
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:08,289
<i>All that frustration,
I'll never get any work done.</i>

24
00:01:08,449 --> 00:01:10,280
<i>So I'm doing a complete 360.</i>

25
00:01:10,449 --> 00:01:12,724
<i>I'm going for total
efficiency and ability.</i>

26
00:01:12,889 --> 00:01:14,083
<i>That's a 180, George.</i>

27
00:01:14,249 --> 00:01:15,648
<i>Whatever.</i>

28
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:17,722
<i>- Hi, Willie.
- Hey, Jerry.</i>

29
00:01:17,889 --> 00:01:19,083
I got this stuff...

30
00:01:19,249 --> 00:01:22,047
<i>- ... and my mother's fur for storage.
- What are you doing with it?</i>

31
00:01:22,209 --> 00:01:24,769
<i>She keeps it with me
for when she comes up from Florida.</i>

32
00:01:24,929 --> 00:01:26,123
- Hi.
- Hi.

33
00:01:26,289 --> 00:01:27,881
<i>Jerry, you know my wife, Donna.</i>

34
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:29,880
<i>Yeah. That's why I said "hi."</i>

35
00:01:31,089 --> 00:01:33,045
<i>Hey, nice jacket.</i>

36
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:34,528
Thanks. Houndstooth.

37
00:01:34,889 --> 00:01:36,368
<i>This is a beauty.</i>

38
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:39,441
<i>- Great cut. It's probably very flattering.
- Oh, yes.</i>

39
00:01:39,609 --> 00:01:42,043
<i>It really accentuates
my bust line.</i>

40
00:01:42,809 --> 00:01:44,401
<i>Well, I type about
90 words a minute.</i>

41
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:47,606
<i>I'm completely well-versed in all
the IBM and Macintosh programs.</i>

42
00:01:47,769 --> 00:01:50,841
<i>Well, Miss Coggins, you're
obviously qualified for the job.</i>

43
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:54,046
<i>You have all the necessary skills
and experience...</i>

44
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:56,723
<i>...but you're extremely attractive.
You're gorgeous.</i>

45
00:01:56,889 --> 00:01:59,608
<i>I'm looking at you,
I can't even remember my name.</i>

46
00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:03,725
So I'm afraid this is not
gonna work out. Thanks for coming.

47
00:02:03,889 --> 00:02:05,845
<i>You're luscious.
You're ravishing.</i>

48
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:09,319
<i>I would give up red meat just to get
a glimpse of you in a bra.</i>

49
00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:11,639
<i>I'm terribly sorry. Terribly sorry.</i>

50
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:13,880
<i>As you can see, my references
are impeccable.</i>

51
00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:15,767
<i>I think I'd be a real asset here.</i>

52
00:02:15,929 --> 00:02:17,965
<i>My only concern is,
I take care of my mother.</i>

53
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:20,085
<i>So will there be many late nights?</i>

54
00:02:20,609 --> 00:02:21,883
<i>I can't imagine.</i>

55
00:02:23,289 --> 00:02:25,564
<i>Okay. So Barneys is having
this huge sale.</i>

56
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,162
<i>I try this dress on.</i>

57
00:02:27,329 --> 00:02:29,126
Stunning. Stunning.

58
00:02:29,289 --> 00:02:32,281
<i>I couldn't take my eyes off myself.</i>

59
00:02:32,449 --> 00:02:34,838
<i>- Yeah?
- Okay. So then I put it on at home...</i>

60
00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:37,523
<i>...it looks like I'm carrying twins.</i>

61
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:41,080
<i>So you're saying, store, hotsy-totsy,
Home, hotsy-notsy.</i>

62
00:02:42,089 --> 00:02:44,398
<i>Exactly.
Anyway, I gotta go there and return it.</i>

63
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:46,161
<i>I thought we were going
to the movies.</i>

64
00:02:46,329 --> 00:02:49,241
<i>All right. I'll try it on again.
You tell me what you think.</i>

65
00:02:50,089 --> 00:02:51,488
<i>- Hey, hey.
- Hey, George.</i>

66
00:02:51,649 --> 00:02:53,082
<i>Hey, Elaine.</i>

67
00:02:53,249 --> 00:02:56,525
<i>I am telling you, Jerry,
having a secretary is incredible.</i>

68
00:02:56,689 --> 00:02:58,486
<i>Don't know why I didn't
have one before.</i>

69
00:02:58,649 --> 00:03:00,605
<i>Because you didn't have a job?</i>

70
00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:03,323
<i>Perhaps.</i>

71
00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:05,241
<i>I walk in, everything is organized.</i>

72
00:03:05,409 --> 00:03:06,603
<i>Messages, appointments.</i>

73
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:10,159
<i>I can't tell you how proud I am
of myself for going with Ada.</i>

74
00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:11,728
<i>A lesser man would've crumbled.</i>

75
00:03:11,889 --> 00:03:15,245
<i>They would've gone for the dish and
the sure-fire sexual harassment suit.</i>

76
00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:22,520
<i>- It's a little-
- All right.</i>

77
00:03:22,689 --> 00:03:23,963
<i>You answered it right there.</i>

78
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:25,562
You got no waist in that thing.

79
00:03:25,729 --> 00:03:29,199
<i>And your arms look like something
hanging in a kosher deli.</i>

80
00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:32,609
I said, all right.

81
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:34,805
- Why'd you buy it for?
- Why did I buy it?

82
00:03:34,969 --> 00:03:37,722
<i>Because in the mirror at Barneys,
I looked fabulous.</i>

83
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:39,561
This woman who was just
walking by...

84
00:03:39,729 --> 00:03:42,368
<i>...said I looked like Demi Moore
in Indecent Proposal.</i>

85
00:03:42,529 --> 00:03:44,281
<i>How fast was she walking?</i>

86
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:47,198
<i>"Demi"?</i>

87
00:03:47,369 --> 00:03:49,007
<i>I thought it was "Demi."</i>

88
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:50,842
<i>No, I think it's "Demi."</i>

89
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:52,442
<i>Really?</i>

90
00:03:52,609 --> 00:03:55,521
<i>I never heard of
a "semi"tractor-trailer.</i>

91
00:03:58,009 --> 00:03:59,158
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

92
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:01,399
<i>Wait a minute.
I know what's going on here.</i>

93
00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:03,958
- Skinny mirrors.
- What?

94
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:06,359
<i>Skinny mirrors.
Barneys has skinny mirrors.</i>

95
00:04:06,529 --> 00:04:08,360
<i>They make you look
10 pounds lighter.</i>

96
00:04:08,529 --> 00:04:10,008
<i>Oh, you're crazy.</i>

97
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:11,318
Am I?

98
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:13,798
<i>Do you think I would've
bought this dress...</i>

99
00:04:13,969 --> 00:04:16,119
<i>...if I looked like this at Barneys?</i>

100
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:18,359
<i>You know, I think
she may have something.</i>

101
00:04:21,969 --> 00:04:23,448
<i>What are you all dressed up for?</i>

102
00:04:23,609 --> 00:04:25,565
<i>I'm returning this dress to Barneys.</i>

103
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:27,162
<i>Good idea.</i>

104
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:29,647
<i>Do it tomorrow.
We'll go to the movies.</i>

105
00:04:29,809 --> 00:04:31,322
<i>- Okay.
- Hey, if you're going...</i>

106
00:04:31,489 --> 00:04:34,003
<i>...maybe you can pick me up
some super-hydrating-</i>

107
00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:37,559
<i>It's a total-protection moisturizer
with UVA. Yeah.</i>

108
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:41,121
<i>- Moisturizer? That's girl stuff.
- No. Look, I'll tell you what.</i>

109
00:04:41,289 --> 00:04:42,847
<i>- They're having a sale, right?
- Yeah.</i>

110
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:44,840
<i>I'll meet you there.
We'll have lunch.</i>

111
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:47,877
<i>- Well, we could-
- Yeah, we'll get to know each other.</i>

112
00:04:48,049 --> 00:04:50,040
<i>We never get to spend
any time together.</i>

113
00:04:50,209 --> 00:04:53,440
<i>Oh, sure. We have
our little group here, but...</i>

114
00:04:55,689 --> 00:04:58,328
<i>And then, assuming
the strike is resolved...</i>

115
00:04:58,489 --> 00:05:01,003
<i>...on April 14th,
we play the Angels.</i>

116
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:03,683
<i>So let's clear a floor
at the Anaheim Hotel.</i>

117
00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:06,682
<i>Anaheim Hotel.
You may wanna reconsider.</i>

118
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:10,603
<i>I believe they only have room service
until 10 p. m, then it's only finger foods.</i>

119
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:13,887
<i>Ada, you're a wonder.</i>

120
00:05:14,369 --> 00:05:17,645
<i>Okay. Now, I projected those figures
for you regarding the switch...</i>

121
00:05:17,809 --> 00:05:19,481
...to canola oil for stadium popcorn.

122
00:05:19,649 --> 00:05:22,209
<i>Surprisingly, it'll only cost
half a cent more per bag...</i>

123
00:05:22,369 --> 00:05:23,722
<i>...so it's definitely doable.</i>

124
00:05:24,129 --> 00:05:27,963
<i>Ada, I have to tell you, I have
never met anybody so efficient.</i>

125
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:30,199
<i>Well, thank you. I'm flattered.</i>

126
00:05:31,649 --> 00:05:34,163
<i>You're just a marvel of organization.</i>

127
00:05:34,329 --> 00:05:37,241
<i>Well, I'm just doing my job.</i>

128
00:05:38,209 --> 00:05:40,165
<i>It's like-
I'm thinking of something...</i>

129
00:05:40,329 --> 00:05:42,206
<i>...and you're one step ahead of me.</i>

130
00:05:42,369 --> 00:05:44,485
<i>What can I say? I'm...</i>

131
00:05:44,649 --> 00:05:47,004
I'm good at what I do.

132
00:05:48,609 --> 00:05:50,201
Do you...?

133
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:52,965
Do you know what I'm...

134
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:56,758
...thinking about now?

135
00:05:57,049 --> 00:05:59,199
<i>Yes. I think I do.</i>

136
00:06:00,089 --> 00:06:01,522
Is it...

137
00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:04,761
<i>...doable?</i>

138
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:07,007
<i>It's definitely doable.</i>

139
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:16,280
<i>Well, that was the worst.</i>

140
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:18,565
<i>I can't believe they made
the wife the killer.</i>

141
00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:20,162
<i>- Give me a break.
- Hey.</i>

142
00:06:20,329 --> 00:06:22,365
<i>Give us a break.
We haven't seen it yet.</i>

143
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:24,520
<i>- Thanks a lot, bigmouth.
- Yeah.</i>

144
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:26,122
<i>- Got a pen?
- Yeah. I think I do.</i>

145
00:06:26,529 --> 00:06:28,008
<i>I need something to write on.</i>

146
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:29,966
<i>Well, all I got is
my dry-cleaning stub.</i>

147
00:06:30,129 --> 00:06:31,323
<i>I just met Uma Thurman.</i>

148
00:06:31,489 --> 00:06:34,128
<i>She's giving me her telephone
number. Uma, Jerry. Uma.</i>

149
00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:36,757
<i>- Uma Thurman? Really?
- How'd you manage that?</i>

150
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:39,079
<i>Yeah. Well-
I don't have any time to talk now.</i>

151
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:42,323
<i>He's got the kavorca.</i>

152
00:06:43,809 --> 00:06:46,323
<i>- Hey, isn't that Willie, my dry cleaner?
- Where?</i>

153
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,286
<i>He just went in.</i>

154
00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:49,843
You know, I-

155
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:53,081
<i>I think he was wearing
my houndstooth jacket.</i>

156
00:06:53,649 --> 00:06:56,117
<i>What would he be doing
wearing your jacket?</i>

157
00:06:56,289 --> 00:06:59,087
<i>It looked just like the jacket
I brought in to be dry-cleaned.</i>

158
00:06:59,249 --> 00:07:00,762
<i>He complimented me on it.</i>

159
00:07:00,929 --> 00:07:02,726
<i>- Are you sure?
- I got it.</i>

160
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:04,845
Uma, Uma, Uma.

161
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:06,601
<i>- You are amazing.
- Yeah.</i>

162
00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:09,363
<i>All right. Taxi's on me.</i>

163
00:07:13,689 --> 00:07:16,249
<i>No, no, no. A better way
to reach the bra...</i>

164
00:07:16,409 --> 00:07:19,606
<i>...would be to undo the jacket
then go around the back of the shirt.</i>

165
00:07:20,809 --> 00:07:22,037
<i>Ada, you're incredible.</i>

166
00:07:28,089 --> 00:07:29,761
<i>Here. I wanna show you something.</i>

167
00:07:29,929 --> 00:07:31,806
<i>Hand me that pillow.</i>

168
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:33,482
<i>Here.</i>

169
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:36,088
What?

170
00:07:36,609 --> 00:07:39,328
Oh, my God.

171
00:07:39,489 --> 00:07:41,127
Mr. Costanza.

172
00:07:41,289 --> 00:07:42,847
Ada.

173
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:47,446
<i>- I'm giving you a raise!
- Yes!</i>

174
00:07:49,129 --> 00:07:51,802
<i>So you're having sex,
then all of a sudden you blurt out:</i>

175
00:07:51,969 --> 00:07:54,688
<i>"I'm giving you a raise"?</i>

176
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:56,283
<i>Yeah.</i>

177
00:07:57,129 --> 00:07:58,608
<i>Just a quick sidebar here.</i>

178
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:00,680
<i>Are you in any way
authorized to give raises?</i>

179
00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:03,079
<i>- Not that I'm aware of.
- No.</i>

180
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:07,006
<i>So you're so grateful to have sex,
you'll shout out anything...</i>

181
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:08,682
<i>...that comes into your head.</i>

182
00:08:08,849 --> 00:08:10,521
<i>I didn't think ahead.</i>

183
00:08:10,689 --> 00:08:12,759
<i>Maybe she'll just think
it was bawdy talk.</i>

184
00:08:13,249 --> 00:08:15,638
<i>I didn't say any other bawdy things.</i>

185
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:19,360
<i>Maybe you could have sex
with her again and then take it back.</i>

186
00:08:20,289 --> 00:08:22,359
<i>All right. You're not
any help at all here.</i>

187
00:08:22,529 --> 00:08:24,247
<i>I don't know the point
of talking to you.</i>

188
00:08:24,409 --> 00:08:26,525
All right, all right, I'm sorry.

189
00:08:26,689 --> 00:08:30,318
<i>Yeah. Well, the only thing I can do
is to go to George Steinbrenner...</i>

190
00:08:30,489 --> 00:08:32,286
<i>...and tell him he has
to give her a raise.</i>

191
00:08:32,449 --> 00:08:34,519
<i>- How long has she been there?
- Three days.</i>

192
00:08:35,009 --> 00:08:37,125
<i>- It's almost a week.
- Yeah.</i>

193
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:42,806
Oh, my God.

194
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:46,166
<i>- What?
- It's a movie stub from the 9:30 show.</i>

195
00:08:46,329 --> 00:08:50,038
<i>George, I think Willie the dry cleaner's
been wearing my clothes.</i>

196
00:08:54,049 --> 00:08:56,563
<i>These mirrors are skinny mirrors.</i>

197
00:08:56,729 --> 00:08:59,323
<i>This is false...</i>

198
00:08:59,609 --> 00:09:01,645
<i>...reflecting.</i>

199
00:09:01,849 --> 00:09:05,728
<i>And I think that the department of...</i>

200
00:09:05,889 --> 00:09:07,527
<i>...you know, whatever...</i>

201
00:09:07,689 --> 00:09:11,443
<i>...would be very interested
to know what's going on here.</i>

202
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:15,444
<i>Well, we're more than happy
to exchange it for something else.</i>

203
00:09:15,609 --> 00:09:17,361
<i>Okay. Fine.</i>

204
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:19,520
<i>I did like that little
Calvin Klein number...</i>

205
00:09:19,689 --> 00:09:21,520
<i>...right by the elevator,
with the little-</i>

206
00:09:21,689 --> 00:09:24,920
<i>- I'll bring it to your dressing room.
- Okay. Thanks so much.</i>

207
00:09:26,209 --> 00:09:27,801
<i>What are you all dressed up for?</i>

208
00:09:27,969 --> 00:09:30,324
<i>Elaine, when you're shopping
on Madison Avenue...</i>

209
00:09:30,489 --> 00:09:32,525
<i>...you don't wanna skimp
on the swank.</i>

210
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:34,442
<i>I like your little bag.</i>

211
00:09:34,609 --> 00:09:37,169
<i>Oh, yeah. Hey, look at this.</i>

212
00:09:37,329 --> 00:09:42,039
<i>This is a super-hydrating,
triple-action moisturizer, huh?</i>

213
00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:44,120
<i>Wait till that Uma smells this UVA.</i>

214
00:09:46,729 --> 00:09:49,880
<i>- Hey, Kramer.
- Hey, Bania. What's happening?</i>

215
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:53,486
<i>I'm looking for a new suit,
but I can't find anything I like.</i>

216
00:09:53,809 --> 00:09:56,642
<i>- That's a nice suit.
- Well, thank you.</i>

217
00:09:56,809 --> 00:09:58,401
<i>- Did you get that here?
- No, no, no.</i>

218
00:09:58,569 --> 00:10:00,764
<i>This is vintage.
They don't make this anymore.</i>

219
00:10:00,929 --> 00:10:02,681
<i>- You're telling me.
- I sure am.</i>

220
00:10:03,009 --> 00:10:04,158
It's hard to find pants-

221
00:10:04,329 --> 00:10:06,320
<i>- That don't make you high-waisted?
- Yes.</i>

222
00:10:06,489 --> 00:10:08,081
<i>- Me too.
- What size are you?</i>

223
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:11,039
- Forty-two.
- Forty-two? That's what I am now.

224
00:10:11,209 --> 00:10:13,086
<i>I've been working out. I'm huge.</i>

225
00:10:15,609 --> 00:10:16,928
<i>How'd you like to sell it?</i>

226
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:18,842
<i>Make me an offer.</i>

227
00:10:19,249 --> 00:10:21,843
<i>- One hundred bucks.
- Surely you jest.</i>

228
00:10:22,769 --> 00:10:24,202
<i>One seventy-five?</i>

229
00:10:24,369 --> 00:10:25,768
<i>Look at the stitching.</i>

230
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:28,727
This is old-world craftsmanship.

231
00:10:28,969 --> 00:10:30,402
<i>- Three hundred dollars.
- Sold.</i>

232
00:10:30,569 --> 00:10:33,367
<i>- Follow me into the dressing room.
- You'll throw the shirt in?</i>

233
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:35,440
<i>Bania, you're killing me.</i>

234
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:37,407
<i>Hey, that's the women's
dressing room.</i>

235
00:10:37,569 --> 00:10:39,480
<i>There's nothing there
I haven't seen before.</i>

236
00:10:46,809 --> 00:10:48,561
<i>Mr. Steinbrenner?</i>

237
00:10:49,009 --> 00:10:50,328
<i>Can I talk to you for a second?</i>

238
00:10:50,489 --> 00:10:52,207
<i>Yes. Yes, George.
Can you talk to me?</i>

239
00:10:52,369 --> 00:10:54,280
<i>Of course.
I'm a very accessible man.</i>

240
00:10:54,449 --> 00:10:57,088
<i>I wanna say you're doing great
on that canola-oil stuff.</i>

241
00:10:57,249 --> 00:10:59,046
<i>Well, you know,
to be honest, sir, my-</i>

242
00:10:59,209 --> 00:11:01,359
<i>My new secretary, Ada,
came up with that one.</i>

243
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:03,918
<i>Ada. Ada. I like that name, George.</i>

244
00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:05,681
<i>She supports her whole family.</i>

245
00:11:05,849 --> 00:11:07,407
<i>- Is that a fact, George?
- Yes.</i>

246
00:11:07,569 --> 00:11:09,241
<i>In fact, her mom's in the hospital.</i>

247
00:11:09,409 --> 00:11:11,479
<i>It's some kind of a diverticulitis.</i>

248
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:15,005
<i>I had a bout of that myself one time,
knocked me right on my ass.</i>

249
00:11:15,169 --> 00:11:17,524
<i>She can't even afford
to go out to lunch. She-</i>

250
00:11:17,689 --> 00:11:19,520
<i>She's been eating
in school cafeterias.</i>

251
00:11:19,689 --> 00:11:22,044
<i>She pretends to be a teacher.
It's pathetic.</i>

252
00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:23,801
<i>What does that cost?
Two and a quarter?</i>

253
00:11:23,969 --> 00:11:27,644
<i>You know, I was just thinking
that she could really use a raise.</i>

254
00:11:27,809 --> 00:11:30,198
<i>She'd be better off making
a sandwich and bringing it.</i>

255
00:11:30,369 --> 00:11:31,722
<i>Hello?</i>

256
00:11:31,889 --> 00:11:33,800
<i>George, will you excuse me?</i>

257
00:11:41,129 --> 00:11:42,847
<i>Kramer. What are you doing?</i>

258
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:45,125
<i>Listen, I need you
to get me some clothes.</i>

259
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:46,802
<i>- What?
- Yeah. I just sold my suit...</i>

260
00:11:46,969 --> 00:11:48,448
...to Bania for a cool 300.

261
00:11:48,969 --> 00:11:50,197
<i>So go buy a new one.</i>

262
00:11:50,369 --> 00:11:52,883
<i>At this place?
It would destroy my profit margin.</i>

263
00:11:53,249 --> 00:11:55,444
<i>- So?
- Listen, do me a favour. Just call Jerry.</i>

264
00:11:55,609 --> 00:11:57,725
<i>Tell him to bring me some clothes.</i>

265
00:12:05,249 --> 00:12:08,161
<i>- Hello, Willie.
- Hey, Jerry.</i>

266
00:12:08,329 --> 00:12:10,001
<i>- You're dropping off.
- No...</i>

267
00:12:10,169 --> 00:12:13,559
<i>...but seen any good movies lately?</i>

268
00:12:14,129 --> 00:12:16,279
<i>- You came by to ask that?
- Yeah.</i>

269
00:12:16,449 --> 00:12:18,121
<i>Specifically, 9:30 shows.</i>

270
00:12:18,289 --> 00:12:21,884
<i>Seen any good 9:30 shows
at the Paragon, Willie?</i>

271
00:12:22,049 --> 00:12:23,767
<i>- What are you getting at?
- I saw you...</i>

272
00:12:23,929 --> 00:12:26,124
<i>...stepping out
with my houndstooth jacket.</i>

273
00:12:26,289 --> 00:12:29,565
<i>Jerry, that's a breach
of the dry cleaners' code.</i>

274
00:12:29,729 --> 00:12:33,085
<i>You need a code to tell you
not to wear people's clothes?</i>

275
00:12:33,249 --> 00:12:35,638
<i>I wasn't wearing your jacket.</i>

276
00:12:35,809 --> 00:12:39,165
<i>- Jerry, you're imagining things.
- Yeah.</i>

277
00:12:39,329 --> 00:12:41,365
Am I imagining this?

278
00:12:42,809 --> 00:12:44,606
<i>Found that little cutie in the pocket.</i>

279
00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:46,282
<i>- Jerry-
- Yeah. Well, now that...</i>

280
00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:49,043
<i>...we understand each other,
I'll take my business elsewhere.</i>

281
00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:52,007
<i>- I want my mother's fur coat back too.
- Jerry, come on.</i>

282
00:12:52,169 --> 00:12:54,763
- Now.
- Now?

283
00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:03,160
<i>Yeah. I want that coat.</i>

284
00:13:03,329 --> 00:13:05,923
<i>- Well-
- Where's the ticket?</i>

285
00:13:07,009 --> 00:13:08,647
<i>- Kramer.
- Wait a minute.</i>

286
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:11,960
<i>You mean to tell me that
you don't have a ticket for the coat?</i>

287
00:13:12,129 --> 00:13:13,642
<i>No. Not on me.</i>

288
00:13:13,929 --> 00:13:16,124
<i>Well, I need to see that ticket.</i>

289
00:13:16,289 --> 00:13:17,961
<i>Why? I've gotten cleaning without it.</i>

290
00:13:18,129 --> 00:13:19,960
<i>Yeah, but this is different.</i>

291
00:13:20,129 --> 00:13:23,007
<i>Those fur-storage warehouses
are huge.</i>

292
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,967
<i>You can't get anything
without a number.</i>

293
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,925
<i>All right. I'll be back.</i>

294
00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:35,001
<i>Yeah. It looks good here,
but what does that mean?</i>

295
00:13:35,729 --> 00:13:37,959
So do you want it?

296
00:13:38,129 --> 00:13:40,279
<i>I don't know. I have to think about it.</i>

297
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:44,441
<i>I need a non-partisan mirror.</i>

298
00:13:54,329 --> 00:13:56,126
<i>I can't thank you enough,
Mr. Costanza.</i>

299
00:13:56,289 --> 00:13:59,281
<i>- I'm so grateful.
- Yes. Well...</i>

300
00:13:59,449 --> 00:14:01,280
<i>...I sat down with Mr. Steinbrenner.</i>

301
00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:03,201
<i>I told him you've
been doing great work.</i>

302
00:14:03,369 --> 00:14:05,963
<i>I said you deserved a raise,
and if you didn't get it...</i>

303
00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:08,597
<i>...that I was leaving.</i>

304
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:10,482
<i>It was just so generous.</i>

305
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:12,844
<i>Don't worry about it.
He's got plenty of money.</i>

306
00:14:13,009 --> 00:14:16,445
Oh, I know, but 25,000.

307
00:14:19,649 --> 00:14:23,847
<i>- So you got a $25,000-a-year raise?
- Yes.</i>

308
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:27,087
<i>- I tell you, Mr. Steinbrenner-
- You're making more than I am.</i>

309
00:14:27,249 --> 00:14:29,888
<i>- I am?
- A secretary cannot make more...</i>

310
00:14:30,049 --> 00:14:33,564
<i>- ... than her boss.
- Well, apparently they can.</i>

311
00:14:46,849 --> 00:14:48,043
Oh, this is insanity.

312
00:14:48,209 --> 00:14:50,404
I'm not this hip-y.

313
00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:52,920
<i>Hey. Hey, what do you think of this?</i>

314
00:14:53,729 --> 00:14:55,959
<i>You'll never pull it off.</i>

315
00:14:56,609 --> 00:14:58,167
<i>Hey. What's going on in there?</i>

316
00:14:58,329 --> 00:15:01,719
<i>Excuse me. Could you tell me where I
could find women's moisturizer lotions?</i>

317
00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:05,719
<i>This woman's been in there
for over an hour.</i>

318
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:10,925
<i>Excuse me, miss.
Is everything okay in there?</i>

319
00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:12,363
<i>Yeah.</i>

320
00:15:16,169 --> 00:15:19,479
<i>- Kramer?
- Jerry. You got my clothes?</i>

321
00:15:20,009 --> 00:15:22,603
<i>- What clothes?
- Didn't Elaine call you?</i>

322
00:15:22,769 --> 00:15:24,122
No.

323
00:15:24,329 --> 00:15:25,921
<i>Well, what are you doing here?</i>

324
00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:29,286
<i>What am I doing here?
You're in the women's dressing room.</i>

325
00:15:29,449 --> 00:15:32,282
<i>I need that ticket stub back so I can
get my mom's fur coat out.</i>

326
00:15:32,449 --> 00:15:35,327
<i>The stub. Yeah.
I left it in my- My pants.</i>

327
00:15:35,489 --> 00:15:39,198
<i>- Where are your pants?
- Well, I sold them to Bania.</i>

328
00:15:39,969 --> 00:15:43,086
<i>What? You sold your pants
to Bania? Let me in.</i>

329
00:15:45,289 --> 00:15:47,280
<i>Why'd you sell your pants to Bania?</i>

330
00:15:47,449 --> 00:15:49,565
<i>I had Uma Thurman's number
written on that stub.</i>

331
00:15:49,729 --> 00:15:50,957
<i>I lost Uma's number.</i>

332
00:15:52,129 --> 00:15:55,007
<i>- Where are your clothes?
- I told you, I sold them to Bania.</i>

333
00:15:55,569 --> 00:15:57,560
<i>- You mean, what you were wearing?
- Yeah.</i>

334
00:15:57,729 --> 00:15:59,287
<i>How'd you expect
to get out of here?</i>

335
00:15:59,569 --> 00:16:01,844
<i>Well, I didn't think ahead.</i>

336
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:11,160
<i>This- This isn't gonna work for me.</i>

337
00:16:11,329 --> 00:16:13,559
<i>So if you could show me
something else.</i>

338
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:15,158
No.

339
00:16:16,929 --> 00:16:19,648
<i>- No?
- No. Because you're taking that one.</i>

340
00:16:20,369 --> 00:16:22,837
<i>- I am?
- Yes. You wore it outside.</i>

341
00:16:24,449 --> 00:16:26,326
<i>That's preposterous.</i>

342
00:16:26,489 --> 00:16:31,165
<i>Well, I suppose that salt stain
came from all the snow in the store.</i>

343
00:16:33,489 --> 00:16:35,480
<i>Shall I wrap it,
or will you wear it out?</i>

344
00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:38,359
No. You can wrap it.

345
00:16:42,609 --> 00:16:45,077
<i>- Kramer, you still in there?
- Elaine?</i>

346
00:16:45,689 --> 00:16:47,202
<i>Jerry?</i>

347
00:16:47,369 --> 00:16:49,087
<i>- Elaine, where's Kramer?
- Bania?</i>

348
00:16:49,249 --> 00:16:51,126
<i>- Kramer?
- I'm going out.</i>

349
00:16:51,849 --> 00:16:53,282
<i>- Jerry.
- Bania.</i>

350
00:16:53,449 --> 00:16:55,519
<i>Kramer, I want my money back
for this suit.</i>

351
00:16:55,689 --> 00:16:57,725
<i>Your nancy-boy cream leaked
all over the pockets.</i>

352
00:16:57,889 --> 00:17:00,119
<i>- Suit's ruined.
- You're not getting any money back.</i>

353
00:17:00,289 --> 00:17:02,928
<i>- Jerry, come back.
- Excuse me.</i>

354
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:06,359
<i>- Uma's number's on that ticket.
- Never mind Uma.</i>

355
00:17:06,529 --> 00:17:08,406
<i>I need that ticket
to get my mother's coat.</i>

356
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,048
<i>Why not just give him the money?</i>

357
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:14,919
<i>I'm not giving him $300 now for a suit
with moisturizer cream all over it.</i>

358
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:17,288
<i>- I got an idea.
- What?</i>

359
00:17:17,449 --> 00:17:19,963
<i>I can't believe I'm gonna do this.</i>

360
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:22,602
<i>Can I talk to you for a second?</i>

361
00:17:23,169 --> 00:17:24,887
<i>How's everything going?</i>

362
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:26,483
<i>- Pretty good.
- Yeah.</i>

363
00:17:26,649 --> 00:17:29,083
<i>See, the thing is,
I'm in an awkward position here...</i>

364
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:32,241
<i>...because I don't wanna get
between you two guys...</i>

365
00:17:32,409 --> 00:17:35,481
<i>...but I need a dry-cleaning ticket
that's in the pocket of those pants.</i>

366
00:17:35,649 --> 00:17:38,163
<i>All you gotta do is tell Kramer
to give me my money back...</i>

367
00:17:38,329 --> 00:17:40,604
<i>- ... and you'll get your ticket.
- Yeah.</i>

368
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:44,444
<i>Yeah, all right.
Well, tell you what I will do, Bania.</i>

369
00:17:45,089 --> 00:17:47,125
<i>You give me the ticket...</i>

370
00:17:47,289 --> 00:17:50,326
<i>...and I will take you out
for a nice dinner.</i>

371
00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:53,562
<i>Can we go back to Mendy's?</i>

372
00:17:53,729 --> 00:17:55,845
<i>You wanna go to Mendy's,
I'll take you to Mendy's.</i>

373
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:59,046
<i>- Twice. I wanna go twice.
- All right, let's be reasonable, Bania.</i>

374
00:17:59,209 --> 00:18:01,882
<i>I'm taking you out for dinner.
All I want is a little ticket.</i>

375
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:04,722
<i>- I think that's a pretty good deal.
- Two Mendy's.</i>

376
00:18:06,369 --> 00:18:07,563
All right.

377
00:18:07,729 --> 00:18:10,004
<i>- Just give me the ticket.
- Here you go.</i>

378
00:18:10,849 --> 00:18:15,400
<i>But, Mr. Steinbrenner, how can I be
expected to perform my job properly...</i>

379
00:18:15,569 --> 00:18:19,278
<i>...knowing that my subordinate
is making more money than I am?</i>

380
00:18:19,449 --> 00:18:21,724
<i>With all due respect, sir,
it's out of whack.</i>

381
00:18:21,889 --> 00:18:23,322
<i>I understand what you're saying.</i>

382
00:18:23,489 --> 00:18:25,286
<i>I know what it's like
to be strapped.</i>

383
00:18:25,449 --> 00:18:27,679
<i>As a young man in Cleveland,
I hitchhiked to work.</i>

384
00:18:27,849 --> 00:18:29,726
<i>One time I got picked up
by a bakery truck.</i>

385
00:18:29,889 --> 00:18:33,086
<i>Think that smells good? Try being
cooped up in one of those babies.</i>

386
00:18:33,249 --> 00:18:35,399
<i>I couldn't look at a doughnut
for two years.</i>

387
00:18:35,569 --> 00:18:37,241
<i>Not that I was ever one
for the sweets.</i>

388
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:40,162
<i>Sure, I like a cupcake every
now and then like everybody else.</i>

389
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:43,639
<i>You know, I like it when they have
a little cream inside. It's a surprise.</i>

390
00:18:43,809 --> 00:18:46,004
<i>That's good.
The chocolate ones are good too.</i>

391
00:18:46,169 --> 00:18:47,887
<i>Sometimes I can't even
make up my mind.</i>

392
00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:50,847
<i>A lot of times, I'll mix the two together.
Make a vanilla-fudge.</i>

393
00:18:51,329 --> 00:18:52,887
<i>Let me in, it's me.</i>

394
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:54,960
<i>Here. You don't know
what this is costing me.</i>

395
00:18:55,129 --> 00:18:57,643
<i>All right. Nice work.</i>

396
00:18:57,809 --> 00:18:59,765
<i>Wait. Where's Uma's number?</i>

397
00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:03,001
<i>The moisturizer smudged out
the phone number.</i>

398
00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:05,999
<i>The dry-cleaning number's
gone too.</i>

399
00:19:06,169 --> 00:19:08,239
<i>It must have been
the botanical extracts.</i>

400
00:19:08,409 --> 00:19:10,127
<i>Give me that.</i>

401
00:19:12,249 --> 00:19:14,319
<i>Hey, Bania, the dinner's off.</i>

402
00:19:14,489 --> 00:19:17,049
<i>The ticket's no good.
The numbers are all smudged out.</i>

403
00:19:17,929 --> 00:19:19,487
<i>You trying to get out of Mendy's?</i>

404
00:19:19,649 --> 00:19:21,799
<i>- You can't do that.
- The ticket is worthless.</i>

405
00:19:21,969 --> 00:19:23,448
<i>You promised me.</i>

406
00:19:28,569 --> 00:19:31,606
<i>Hey, isn't that my mother's fur coat?</i>

407
00:19:35,449 --> 00:19:36,928
- No, it's not.
- It is.

408
00:19:37,089 --> 00:19:39,125
<i>- Give me it back.
- What are you talking about?</i>

409
00:19:39,289 --> 00:19:42,964
<i>- You out of your mind?
- Are you crazy, taking my coat?</i>

410
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:50,482
<i>What, do you think the dry cleaners
is your personal closet?</i>

411
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:52,924
<i>Hey, Donna, can you get
the salt stain out of this?</i>

412
00:19:53,089 --> 00:19:55,284
<i>Let me see. Piece of cake.</i>

413
00:19:55,449 --> 00:19:58,600
<i>Bring it in. What size is it?</i>

414
00:20:10,529 --> 00:20:11,803
<i>This soup is great.</i>

415
00:20:12,529 --> 00:20:13,882
<i>Yeah, it's very good.</i>

416
00:20:14,049 --> 00:20:18,406
<i>I told you Mendy's had the best
pea soup. The best, Jerry. The best.</i>

417
00:20:18,689 --> 00:20:21,567
<i>- Are you enjoying it?
- Yeah. I'm having a wonderful time.</i>

418
00:20:21,729 --> 00:20:23,481
<i>Wait till you try the swordfish.</i>

419
00:20:23,649 --> 00:20:25,526
<i>You know, Jerry, I was thinking...</i>

420
00:20:25,689 --> 00:20:28,283
<i>...for our next meal, do you think
we should come here...</i>

421
00:20:28,449 --> 00:20:29,882
<i>...or should we go elsewhere?</i>

422
00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:31,243
It has its pros and cons.

423
00:20:31,409 --> 00:20:34,003
<i>On the one hand, here,
you're guaranteed a great meal.</i>

424
00:20:34,169 --> 00:20:36,205
<i>- On the other hand-
- Yeah, yeah, I know.</i>

425
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:38,087
<i>This would be good,
but it'd be the same.</i>

426
00:20:38,249 --> 00:20:41,366
<i>If we go someplace else, it would
be different, but maybe not as good.</i>

427
00:20:41,529 --> 00:20:44,407
<i>It's a gamble. I get it.</i>

428
00:20:45,089 --> 00:20:46,363
<i>Yeah.</i>

429
00:20:46,529 --> 00:20:49,248
<i>Let's hurry. I gotta go.
I'm meeting a woman for a drink.</i>

430
00:20:49,409 --> 00:20:52,606
<i>- Oh, and who might that be?
- Some woman named Uma.</i>

431
00:20:52,769 --> 00:20:55,158
<i>I got her number off that ticket
before it was smudged.</i>

432
00:20:55,329 --> 00:20:56,603
<i>Hope she's good-looking.</i>

433
00:21:07,969 --> 00:21:11,006
<i>If you are a waiter or a waitress
and you see me in a restaurant...</i>

434
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:14,081
<i>...I'm telling you now,
I don't wanna hear about the specials.</i>

435
00:21:14,249 --> 00:21:17,639
<i>I don't wanna know about the specials,
I'm sick of the specials, I hate them.</i>

436
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:21,484
<i>My feeling is, if the specials were
so special, they'd be on the menu.</i>

437
00:21:21,889 --> 00:21:25,040
<i>You know what's special? They don't
know if anybody likes them.</i>

438
00:21:25,209 --> 00:21:29,521
<i>And they always have those overly
creative descriptions of the specials.</i>

439
00:21:29,689 --> 00:21:31,327
<i>The veal is lightly slapped...</i>

440
00:21:31,969 --> 00:21:34,403
<i>...and then sequestered
in a one-bedroom suite...</i>

441
00:21:34,569 --> 00:21:37,129
<i>...with a white-wine intravenous.</i>
