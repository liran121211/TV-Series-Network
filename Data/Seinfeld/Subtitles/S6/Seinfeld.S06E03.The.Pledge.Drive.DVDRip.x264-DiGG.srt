1
00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:04,685
There's something insincere
about greeting cards.</i>

2
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:08,598
They're like these little
$1 folded-paper...</i>

3
00:00:08,769 --> 00:00:10,999
...emotional prostitutes, isn't it?</i>

4
00:00:11,169 --> 00:00:14,684
"I don't know what my feelings are,
so I'll pay some total stranger a buck...</i>

5
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:18,364
...to make up this little
Hallmark hooker to do the job for me.</i>

6
00:00:18,529 --> 00:00:20,520
So I can go,
'Here, I didn't write this...</i>

7
00:00:20,689 --> 00:00:24,045
...but whatever they wrote,
I think the same thing."'</i>

8
00:00:24,209 --> 00:00:26,006
Wouldn't it be better
to have one card...</i>

9
00:00:26,169 --> 00:00:28,842
...that covered every occasion
for everybody in one shot?</i>

10
00:00:29,009 --> 00:00:32,206
"Happy birthday, merry Christmas,
happy anniversary, congratulations...</i>

11
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:34,519
...it's a boy
and our deepest sympathies."</i>

12
00:00:34,689 --> 00:00:37,487
Signed, "The whole office."</i>

13
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:43,879
She was hitting on you?</i>

14
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:45,960
My friend Noreen?</i>

15
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:47,642
Your friend Noreen.</i>

16
00:00:47,809 --> 00:00:50,721
- Sure you're not flattering yourself?
- If I was flattering myself...</i>

17
00:00:50,889 --> 00:00:54,438
...I think I'd come up with someone
a little less annoying than Noreen.</i>

18
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:57,642
I cannot believe that
she was hitting on you.</i>

19
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:01,722
- If you don't believe me, ask her.
- Besides, she's got a boyfriend.</i>

20
00:01:01,889 --> 00:01:05,643
You know him, Dan. Remember,
we went to that party at his house?</i>

21
00:01:05,809 --> 00:01:07,959
- The guy with the really high voice.
- Yeah.</i>

22
00:01:09,249 --> 00:01:11,638
Jerry, did you get my Fortune
magazine in your mail?</i>

23
00:01:11,809 --> 00:01:13,242
Check the pile.</i>

24
00:01:14,649 --> 00:01:15,843
Yeah, yeah.</i>

25
00:01:17,209 --> 00:01:19,086
- Who sent you a card?
- I don't know.</i>

26
00:01:19,249 --> 00:01:20,921
Open it. It's from Hallmark.</i>

27
00:01:22,689 --> 00:01:26,284
- Hello, my love.
- Hello, darling.</i>

28
00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:28,600
Isn't that cute.
A thank-you card from Kristin.</i>

29
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:30,202
Let me see.</i>

30
00:01:30,769 --> 00:01:32,043
- Who's Kristin?
- Works for PBS.

31
00:01:32,209 --> 00:01:34,120
Met her when I agreed to do
the pledge drive.</i>

32
00:01:34,289 --> 00:01:35,483
Did you ask her about me?</i>

33
00:01:35,649 --> 00:01:39,164
Yeah. In fact, she said that you could
sit in the back and answer the phone.</i>

34
00:01:39,769 --> 00:01:42,237
Giddyup! All right.
So now, how does that work?</i>

35
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:45,321
What, I get a percentage
of every pledge I bring in, right?</i>

36
00:01:45,769 --> 00:01:49,079
No. It's not aluminium siding.
It's volunteer work.</i>

37
00:01:49,249 --> 00:01:51,205
All the money goes to the station.</i>

38
00:01:51,369 --> 00:01:54,088
Okay, yeah. That sounds good.
But I still get a tote bag, right?</i>

39
00:01:54,249 --> 00:01:56,319
Yeah, and one of those
foam beer-can holders.</i>

40
00:02:00,529 --> 00:02:02,087
You know what I'm doing?

41
00:02:02,249 --> 00:02:04,365
- I'm calling Noreen.
- Go ahead.</i>

42
00:02:04,529 --> 00:02:07,680
- You sure you don't mind?
- Like she'll admit she was flirting.</i>

43
00:02:10,769 --> 00:02:12,680
- Helo?
- Hi. It's Elaine.</i>

44
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:16,125
- Listen, I was just talking to Jerry.
- Jerry?</i>

45
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:20,328
- Jerry Seinfeld.
- Oh, I lik e Jerry a lot.</i>

46
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:24,323
- You mean "like"like?
- What are you talking about?</i>

47
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:27,727
Noreen, were you hitting on him?</i>

48
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:29,686
Noreen's not here.</i>

49
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:31,077
This is Dan.

50
00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:36,927
Did you say that Noreen
was hitting on Jerry Seinfeld?</i>

51
00:02:37,089 --> 00:02:39,603
I'll call you back later.</i>

52
00:02:41,089 --> 00:02:44,365
So was I right? She likes me, right?</i>

53
00:02:49,729 --> 00:02:51,481
Hello.</i>

54
00:02:53,809 --> 00:02:57,006
It's for you. Must you keep giving
my number out?</i>

55
00:02:57,169 --> 00:02:59,888
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Pitt.

56
00:03:01,169 --> 00:03:03,922
- Hello.
- Elaine, what is going on?</i>

57
00:03:04,089 --> 00:03:07,081
Why did you tell Dan
I was hitting on Jerry Seinfeld?</i>

58
00:03:07,249 --> 00:03:10,127
- Is this Noreen?
- What would ever possess you...</i>

59
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:11,881
...to make up a story like that?</i>

60
00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:15,678
Well, listen, Jerry mentioned it,
and I didn't believe-</i>

61
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:18,044
I think I deserve an explanation.</i>

62
00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:21,158
Noreen, are you crying?</i>

63
00:03:22,249 --> 00:03:25,321
No, this is Dan.

64
00:03:27,089 --> 00:03:29,045
- Hi, Dan.
- Elaine?</i>

65
00:03:29,649 --> 00:03:31,526
Work?

66
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:34,569
Tell Noreen I'll just
call her back later.</i>

67
00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:36,763
Who was crying?

68
00:03:36,929 --> 00:03:39,568
No one. I'm sorry, Mr. Pitt.
That won't happen again.</i>

69
00:03:39,729 --> 00:03:42,880
I'm sure it won't.
But someone was crying...</i>

70
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:44,448
...and I want to know who it was.

71
00:03:45,289 --> 00:03:47,325
Well, it's a long story, okay?</i>

72
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:51,243
But my stupid friend Jerry
told my other friend Noreen...</i>

73
00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:53,718
...that she was...</i>

74
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:57,963
...you know, hitting on him.

75
00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:02,919
And so I called her to see
what was going on...</i>

76
00:04:03,089 --> 00:04:06,206
...and I accidentally got
her boyfriend, who is this...</i>

77
00:04:06,649 --> 00:04:08,446
...you know...</i>

78
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:13,727
I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
I tell jokes for a living...</i>

79
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:18,041
...but there's no joking about
the financial crisis at PBS.</i>

80
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:19,847
Show us you care.</i>

81
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:22,921
Call in your pledge now.</i>

82
00:04:23,089 --> 00:04:25,239
Jerry, I am so grateful
that you're doing this.</i>

83
00:04:25,409 --> 00:04:27,320
Oh, I know you are.</i>

84
00:04:27,769 --> 00:04:29,805
- You got the card I sent?
- I did.</i>

85
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:33,086
- So where is it?
- What?</i>

86
00:04:33,249 --> 00:04:34,762
The card.</i>

87
00:04:37,769 --> 00:04:39,680
Is this it in the trash?</i>

88
00:04:42,289 --> 00:04:43,961
No.

89
00:04:45,489 --> 00:04:47,207
This is my card. You threw it away.</i>

90
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:50,766
- Well...
- I put a lot of thought into this card.</i>

91
00:04:50,929 --> 00:04:53,159
You signed your name
and you addressed the envelope.</i>

92
00:04:53,329 --> 00:04:56,480
It's not like you painted the picture
and wrote the poem.</i>

93
00:04:58,289 --> 00:04:59,802
Oh, fine.</i>

94
00:05:00,329 --> 00:05:01,728
I gotta get back to the office.</i>

95
00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:05,086
Why, because I threw the card out?
How long was I supposed to save it?</i>

96
00:05:05,249 --> 00:05:07,046
You have no sentimentality.</i>

97
00:05:07,209 --> 00:05:09,803
I have sentimentality.
Really. I'm sentimental.</i>

98
00:05:09,969 --> 00:05:11,687
Here, look.
Here's some cards I've saved.</i>

99
00:05:11,849 --> 00:05:13,805
These are birthday cards
from my grandmother.</i>

100
00:05:13,969 --> 00:05:16,358
- I'm not a bad guy.
- So you save her cards but not mine.</i>

101
00:05:16,529 --> 00:05:17,723
Oh, great!</i>

102
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:21,006
Well, but you see,
I saved something. See?</i>

103
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:23,399
I can save.</i>

104
00:05:23,729 --> 00:05:25,879
I'll see you
at the pledge drive, okay?</i>

105
00:05:26,049 --> 00:05:28,688
Well, new cards, huh?</i>

106
00:05:28,849 --> 00:05:31,682
No. They're old cards
from my grandmother.</i>

107
00:05:31,849 --> 00:05:36,206
Well, I'll tell you, a nice greeting card
can really lift a person's spirits.</i>

108
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:38,166
Yeah.</i>

109
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:41,802
- A check.
- Yeah, she puts $10...</i>

110
00:05:41,969 --> 00:05:44,164
...in every birthday card.
That's why I save them.</i>

111
00:05:44,329 --> 00:05:47,002
There's a check in all these?
Why don't you cash them?</i>

112
00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:48,648
I don't know. It's $10.

113
00:05:48,809 --> 00:05:51,881
Yeah, but you got a whole pile here.
Look at this, 1987.</i>

114
00:05:52,049 --> 00:05:55,246
- So what?
- Your grandmother gave you this gift.</i>

115
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:58,606
She wants you to spend the money,
to have the fun that she can't have.</i>

116
00:05:58,769 --> 00:06:00,760
This is tantamount
to a slap in the face.</i>

117
00:06:00,929 --> 00:06:02,567
- Oh, get out of here.
- Jerry...</i>

118
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:06,039
...a gift not enjoyed is like
a flower that doesn't blossom.</i>

119
00:06:06,209 --> 00:06:09,963
All right. All right.
I'll cash the checks.</i>

120
00:06:10,129 --> 00:06:11,323
Yeah.</i>

121
00:06:12,369 --> 00:06:15,839
It was a thank-you card from Kristin
because I'm doing the PBS drive.</i>

122
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:17,886
I mean, how long am I supposed
to keep it?</i>

123
00:06:18,049 --> 00:06:20,517
The rule's a minimum of two days.</i>

124
00:06:21,529 --> 00:06:23,247
You making that up, or you know?

125
00:06:23,489 --> 00:06:25,320
I'm making it up.

126
00:06:25,489 --> 00:06:27,684
I mean, really, what is the point
of saving it?</i>

127
00:06:27,849 --> 00:06:29,885
I could see if I had a mantel.</i>

128
00:06:30,049 --> 00:06:32,279
Well, a mantel's
a whole different story.</i>

129
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:34,644
- Absolutely.
- If my parents had a mantel...</i>

130
00:06:34,809 --> 00:06:37,642
...I might be
a completely different person.</i>

131
00:06:37,809 --> 00:06:39,765
So anyway,
she's kind of upset about it...</i>

132
00:06:39,929 --> 00:06:41,567
...so I need you to do me a favour.</i>

133
00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:44,687
- Let's have it.
- Well, I'm doing the PBS drive.</i>

134
00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:48,967
So during the show, they're running
the Ken Burns Basebal thing.</i>

135
00:06:49,129 --> 00:06:51,245
So I thought if I could get
a baseball player...</i>

136
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:52,967
...to come on the show with me...</i>

137
00:06:53,649 --> 00:06:56,368
- You want me to ask a Yankee.
- Could you?</i>

138
00:06:57,769 --> 00:06:59,725
All right.

139
00:07:00,369 --> 00:07:02,803
- I'll run it by a few people.
- All right. Do your thing...</i>

140
00:07:02,969 --> 00:07:04,925
...where you lie to everyone.</i>

141
00:07:06,649 --> 00:07:09,243
I should never have made
that phone call.</i>

142
00:07:09,409 --> 00:07:11,969
- Did you ever get to talk to Noreen?
- Yes. She's very upset.</i>

143
00:07:12,129 --> 00:07:14,120
So was I right about the flirting?
Was it true?</i>

144
00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:16,280
I don't know. I never asked.
She was yelling-</i>

145
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:17,643
Who was flirting with you?

146
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:19,687
Remember when we were
in the bookstore?</i>

147
00:07:19,849 --> 00:07:21,567
That woman came up to us.</i>

148
00:07:22,249 --> 00:07:25,844
- She wasn't flirting with you.
- Oh, sure she was.</i>

149
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:29,763
Asked me where
the humour section was.</i>

150
00:07:29,929 --> 00:07:32,887
Humour? Come on.</i>

151
00:07:33,809 --> 00:07:34,958
Jerry...</i>

152
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:40,522
...her brother just had a book
of political cartoons published.</i>

153
00:07:43,649 --> 00:07:47,403
All right. So maybe she wasn't
flirting with me. So what?</i>

154
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:49,719
Oh, yeah, that's funny.</i>

155
00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:52,119
Hey, you wanna hear
something weird?</i>

156
00:07:52,809 --> 00:07:54,481
Mr. Pitt...

157
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:57,482
...eats his Snickers bars...</i>

158
00:07:57,649 --> 00:08:00,368
...with a knife and fork.</i>

159
00:08:01,569 --> 00:08:03,002
- Really?
- Yes.</i>

160
00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:04,682
Why does he do that?</i>

161
00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:07,568
He probably doesn't wanna
get chocolate on his fingers.</i>

162
00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:10,562
That's the way these society types
eat their candy bars.</i>

163
00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:12,048
Oh, you know.

164
00:08:12,209 --> 00:08:15,485
What, you think I eat
all my meals with you?</i>

165
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:17,927
Excuse me. Sweetheart?</i>

166
00:08:18,929 --> 00:08:21,397
I think you may have
overcharged us.</i>

167
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:23,958
- What is this?
- That's the extra toast.</i>

168
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:25,847
Get it?</i>

169
00:08:27,609 --> 00:08:29,327
Got it.

170
00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:34,084
Did you just see
what happened here?</i>

171
00:08:34,609 --> 00:08:35,803
What?

172
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:38,403
Did you see the way
she pointed at the check?</i>

173
00:08:38,569 --> 00:08:40,560
She gave me the finger.</i>

174
00:08:44,009 --> 00:08:47,206
That's how waitress types
express derision.</i>

175
00:08:47,369 --> 00:08:49,883
They don't wanna get
their mouths dirty.</i>

176
00:08:51,889 --> 00:08:53,925
So, what do you think?

177
00:08:54,289 --> 00:08:55,722
PBS fundraiser?</i>

178
00:08:55,889 --> 00:08:57,720
I'm not gonna waste
the players' time.</i>

179
00:08:57,889 --> 00:09:01,165
Besides, the team already does
so much promotion for Channel 11.</i>

180
00:09:01,489 --> 00:09:03,559
Channel 11.</i>

181
00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:07,726
Forgive me for trying
to class up this place.</i>

182
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:11,279
For trying to have the Yankees
reach another strata of society...</i>

183
00:09:11,449 --> 00:09:14,600
...that might not watch Channel 11.</i>

184
00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:24,282
What the hell are you doing?</i>

185
00:09:25,729 --> 00:09:27,799
I am eating my dessert.</i>

186
00:09:28,689 --> 00:09:31,601
How do you eat it,
with your hands?</i>

187
00:09:34,569 --> 00:09:38,357
You know, maybe George
has something here about PBS.</i>

188
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:41,487
Okay, 60 bucks from Nana.

189
00:09:43,809 --> 00:09:45,606
Yeah.</i>

190
00:09:50,609 --> 00:09:53,169
- Hello?
- Hello. This is Chemical Bank.</i>

191
00:09:53,329 --> 00:09:56,480
Just wanted you to know that
your checking account is overdrawn.</i>

192
00:09:56,649 --> 00:09:58,082
Chemical Bank?</i>

193
00:09:58,249 --> 00:10:00,524
I haven't used that account
in months.</i>

194
00:10:00,689 --> 00:10:03,806
Well, someone's been cashing
the checks, and you're overdrawn.</i>

195
00:10:03,969 --> 00:10:06,324
Oh, dear.</i>

196
00:10:06,489 --> 00:10:09,208
I'll be down there first thing
in the morning.</i>

197
00:10:09,369 --> 00:10:11,087
Wait, we can do this
over the phone.</i>

198
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:24,042
You got Danny Tartabull?

199
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:27,406
You wanted a Yankee,
I got you a Yankee.</i>

200
00:10:27,569 --> 00:10:30,242
You really came through.
Kristin's gonna be thrilled.</i>

201
00:10:30,409 --> 00:10:33,162
The Bull owes me one.
I helped him with his swing.</i>

202
00:10:33,329 --> 00:10:36,082
So you're bringing Danny Tartabull
to the fundraiser tonight.</i>

203
00:10:36,249 --> 00:10:37,807
Absolutely.</i>

204
00:10:37,969 --> 00:10:40,005
Pending approval of the script.</i>

205
00:10:40,169 --> 00:10:43,559
- Excuse me?
- Jerry, I'm Yankee management.</i>

206
00:10:43,729 --> 00:10:47,563
- Yeah, I'd like to see the script too.
- You're just answering phones!</i>

207
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,877
It would put me at ease.</i>

208
00:10:51,049 --> 00:10:54,086
Hey. When you order,
get the waitress to point to the menu.</i>

209
00:10:54,249 --> 00:10:56,365
I wanna see what finger she uses.</i>

210
00:10:56,929 --> 00:11:00,683
Say, I wanted a side order of fruit,
but I didn't see it on the menu.</i>

211
00:11:00,849 --> 00:11:02,919
You'll get it.
Comes with your breakfast special.</i>

212
00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:04,681
Right you are.</i>

213
00:11:04,849 --> 00:11:08,205
You know, I didn't get the special,
but I'd also like the fresh fruit too.</i>

214
00:11:08,369 --> 00:11:10,041
I'll check.</i>

215
00:11:16,449 --> 00:11:18,599
I don't believe it. She did it again!</i>

216
00:11:18,769 --> 00:11:20,441
Oh, she had an itch.</i>

217
00:11:20,609 --> 00:11:22,520
Had an itch.
She could have used any finger.</i>

218
00:11:22,689 --> 00:11:25,157
That finger was meant for me.</i>

219
00:11:25,329 --> 00:11:28,207
Yeah. She knew what
she was doing.</i>

220
00:11:29,329 --> 00:11:30,682
By the way, lunch is on me.</i>

221
00:11:30,849 --> 00:11:33,807
I just cashed my nana's
birthday checks.</i>

222
00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:41,000
Looking for something, lady?</i>

223
00:11:43,089 --> 00:11:45,762
Isn't the Chemical Bank
on this block?</i>

224
00:11:45,929 --> 00:11:48,762
The bank. It burned.</i>

225
00:11:49,529 --> 00:11:51,008
It's gone.</i>

226
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:52,682
Oh, dear.</i>

227
00:11:53,009 --> 00:11:55,318
You know, what you wanna do
is go down to 49th Street.</i>

228
00:11:55,489 --> 00:11:58,242
That's the main
customer-service branch.</i>

229
00:11:58,409 --> 00:12:01,640
Ask for Mr. Fleming. He'll help you.</i>

230
00:12:13,889 --> 00:12:15,880
- Hello.
- Jerry, helo.</i>

231
00:12:16,049 --> 00:12:19,359
- Uncle Leo.
- Listen, I don't wanna alarm you...</i>

232
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:21,645
...but your nana is missing!

233
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:24,203
Nana's missing?

234
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,564
I came to pick her up
for her doctor's appointment.</i>

235
00:12:26,729 --> 00:12:30,768
She wasn't here. I called the doctor.
Nobody knows where she is.</i>

236
00:12:30,929 --> 00:12:35,047
She hasn't left the apartment
in 25 years.</i>

237
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:38,562
I've been thinking about her.
I just cashed some of her checks.</i>

238
00:12:38,729 --> 00:12:40,367
- That's right.
- What kind of checks?</i>

239
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:42,121
- I think Chemical.
- They were Chemical.</i>

240
00:12:42,289 --> 00:12:45,599
Chemical? She hasn't used that
account since her branch closed.</i>

241
00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:47,885
What are you doing
cashing her checks anyway?</i>

242
00:12:48,049 --> 00:12:49,641
Kramer thought it would
make her happy.</i>

243
00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:52,039
I never should have cashed
those checks!</i>

244
00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:53,801
Hey, I didn't twist your arm.</i>

245
00:12:53,969 --> 00:12:55,880
Your grandmother's on
a very fixed income.</i>

246
00:12:56,049 --> 00:12:57,482
What are you, broke?</i>

247
00:12:57,649 --> 00:13:00,209
All right, just call me
if you hear anything.</i>

248
00:13:00,369 --> 00:13:03,520
Well, I cash the checks,
the checks bounce...</i>

249
00:13:03,689 --> 00:13:05,407
...and now my nana's missing!

250
00:13:07,169 --> 00:13:08,921
- Well, don't look at me.
- It's your fault!</i>

251
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:11,728
My fault?
Your nana is missing...

252
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:14,687
...because she's been passing
those bum checks all over town...</i>

253
00:13:14,849 --> 00:13:18,239
...and she finally pissed off
the wrong people.</i>

254
00:13:30,249 --> 00:13:33,525
So anyway, it's caused
a lot of problems.</i>

255
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:36,681
Dan thinks I'm interested in Jerry.
He won't let up.</i>

256
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:38,282
Well, I'm really sorry.</i>

257
00:13:38,449 --> 00:13:40,485
But you can see why
I'd make a mistake like that.</i>

258
00:13:41,009 --> 00:13:42,522
No. Why?

259
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:46,759
Well, you know,
because he's a high talker.</i>

260
00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:50,884
Well, he does raise his voice
occasionally, but that's normal.</i>

261
00:13:51,049 --> 00:13:54,758
No. No, no. Not a loud talker...</i>

262
00:13:54,929 --> 00:13:56,521
...a high talker.</i>

263
00:13:56,689 --> 00:13:58,361
Really?</i>

264
00:13:59,889 --> 00:14:03,245
You don't think his voice sounds
a lot like yours?</i>

265
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:04,683
I never noticed that.</i>

266
00:14:06,449 --> 00:14:09,646
Well, it's no big deal.
You know, it's just that...</i>

267
00:14:09,809 --> 00:14:12,528
...he can sound like a woman,
you know?</i>

268
00:14:12,969 --> 00:14:16,041
Great. I'm going out with a man
who sounds like a woman.</i>

269
00:14:18,449 --> 00:14:20,758
Well, he looks like a man.</i>

270
00:14:21,369 --> 00:14:22,768
Yeah.</i>

271
00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:27,207
He's bald.
I know that's a guy thing.</i>

272
00:14:27,729 --> 00:14:29,401
I guess.</i>

273
00:14:30,449 --> 00:14:32,565
I know he belches a lot.</i>

274
00:14:33,169 --> 00:14:35,319
Well, that's something.</i>

275
00:14:35,969 --> 00:14:39,245
So Jerry thought
I was flirting with him.</i>

276
00:14:39,409 --> 00:14:41,320
Yeah.</i>

277
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:44,326
He's kind of a baritone, isn't he?</i>

278
00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:48,399
- What are you doing?
- I'm eating this cookie.</i>

279
00:14:50,809 --> 00:14:53,039
No, no. But why are you using
a knife and fork?</i>

280
00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:54,437
Did you just think of that?

281
00:14:54,929 --> 00:14:57,079
No. I've seen people do it.</i>

282
00:14:57,249 --> 00:14:59,046
I like it.</i>

283
00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:05,408
- So this isn't gonna take long, is it?
- Oh, no, no. In and out.</i>

284
00:15:05,569 --> 00:15:07,048
I made sure of that.</i>

285
00:15:07,209 --> 00:15:09,803
And you'll be happy to know
I perused the script...</i>

286
00:15:09,969 --> 00:15:13,644
- ... and it's met with my approval.
- Yeah. I'm sure it's fine.</i>

287
00:15:14,129 --> 00:15:16,006
Hey! Hey, watch it!</i>

288
00:15:16,809 --> 00:15:20,688
Did you see that guy?
He just gave me the finger.</i>

289
00:15:21,689 --> 00:15:23,361
- You sure?
- Oh, yeah!</i>

290
00:15:23,529 --> 00:15:26,760
Middle finger, straight up, at me.
At us.</i>

291
00:15:28,329 --> 00:15:31,401
- What are you doing?
- I'm following him.</i>

292
00:15:35,129 --> 00:15:37,768
I'm sorry. The account had
insufficient funds.</i>

293
00:15:37,929 --> 00:15:42,719
We had to return the checks
made out to a Mr. Jerry Seinfeld.</i>

294
00:15:42,889 --> 00:15:46,279
Oh, dear. That's my grandson.</i>

295
00:15:46,449 --> 00:15:50,920
- May I call him now and explain?
- Oh, certainly, certainly.</i>

296
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:54,724
And now I think she might
really be interested in you.</i>

297
00:15:55,649 --> 00:15:57,321
And Dan is obsessed.</i>

298
00:15:57,489 --> 00:16:01,323
He keeps leaving these annoying
messages on my machine.</i>

299
00:16:02,369 --> 00:16:04,007
Would you?

300
00:16:04,849 --> 00:16:08,125
- Hello?
- Hello. I need to speak to Jerry.</i>

301
00:16:08,289 --> 00:16:09,563
Oh, it's you.

302
00:16:09,729 --> 00:16:12,038
We were just talking about you.</i>

303
00:16:12,849 --> 00:16:16,125
Listen, Jerry doesn't wanna
talk to you.</i>

304
00:16:16,289 --> 00:16:20,043
Nobody wants to talk to you,
so why don't you just...

305
00:16:20,209 --> 00:16:22,677
...drop dead.</i>

306
00:16:26,929 --> 00:16:28,920
Hey. All right.</i>

307
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:30,568
- Any word from Nana?
- No.

308
00:16:30,729 --> 00:16:32,924
- Nana?
- Yeah. My grandma's missing.</i>

309
00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:34,408
- Missing?
- Yeah.</i>

310
00:16:34,569 --> 00:16:37,606
Think it might have something to do
with those checks.</i>

311
00:16:39,409 --> 00:16:42,526
What does Nana sound like?</i>

312
00:16:42,849 --> 00:16:44,202
Like a grandmother. Why?</i>

313
00:16:44,369 --> 00:16:46,360
Well, I...</i>

314
00:16:47,489 --> 00:16:50,083
Oh, you hung up on my nana?

315
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,766
I don't know. Maybe.</i>

316
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,806
You told Nana to drop dead.</i>

317
00:16:57,769 --> 00:16:59,964
- It's possible.
- Yes, it is.</i>

318
00:17:00,129 --> 00:17:02,848
All right. Look, Jerry, we gotta
get down to PBS PDQ.</i>

319
00:17:03,009 --> 00:17:04,408
All right.

320
00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:08,684
No one gives us the finger.
We're Yankees.</i>

321
00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:12,726
- Want this last doughnut?
- Oh, you can have it.</i>

322
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:26,439
- Jerry, where are the tote bags?
- I don't know.</i>

323
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:28,645
Well, I'm not leaving
without tote bags.</i>

324
00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:31,687
I was promised tote bags,
and tote bags I shall have.</i>

325
00:17:33,169 --> 00:17:36,764
- Jerry, this man wants to see you.
- Leo.</i>

326
00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:38,726
- Hello.
- Uncle Leo.</i>

327
00:17:38,889 --> 00:17:41,005
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to tell you...</i>

328
00:17:41,169 --> 00:17:42,443
...your grandmother is fine.</i>

329
00:17:43,089 --> 00:17:45,922
She's had quite a day, but she's
gonna watch you tonight on the TV.</i>

330
00:17:46,089 --> 00:17:47,283
- Yeah.
- Jerry.</i>

331
00:17:47,449 --> 00:17:49,440
I'm dying to meet Danny Tartabull.
Where is he?</i>

332
00:17:49,609 --> 00:17:51,486
He'll be here any second.</i>

333
00:17:51,649 --> 00:17:54,209
- You're both on in five minutes.
- Yeah, yeah.</i>

334
00:17:54,369 --> 00:17:56,883
- Okay.
- Bye-bye.</i>

335
00:17:58,769 --> 00:18:01,602
Why didn't you tell me
you were a little short?</i>

336
00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:06,888
Here. If anybody asks you
where you got it, you don't know.</i>

337
00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:10,485
- No, that's okay, I really don't need-
- What are you talking about?</i>

338
00:18:10,649 --> 00:18:12,765
- It's not necessary.
- Would you please take the-?</i>

339
00:18:12,929 --> 00:18:15,682
- I can't take it.
- I want you to have it.</i>

340
00:18:15,849 --> 00:18:19,125
- Jerry, take the money!
- I don't want it!</i>

341
00:18:20,489 --> 00:18:23,208
Jerry, open up. We need to talk.</i>

342
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:25,200
Who's that?

343
00:18:25,369 --> 00:18:28,918
Sounds like that friend of Elaine's
that was hitting on me in the store.</i>

344
00:18:29,089 --> 00:18:30,886
Jerry, I'll take care of it.</i>

345
00:18:31,689 --> 00:18:33,964
Is Jerry in there?</i>

346
00:18:34,129 --> 00:18:36,768
Well, he can't be disturbed now.</i>

347
00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:38,920
Well, this situation's
driving me crazy.</i>

348
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:40,961
He's all I think about.</i>

349
00:18:41,129 --> 00:18:43,689
I can't get him out of my mind.</i>

350
00:18:43,849 --> 00:18:45,168
Well, I'm sorry, fella.</i>

351
00:18:45,329 --> 00:18:47,718
I mean, I know what it's like
to be in love.</i>

352
00:18:47,889 --> 00:18:49,766
It just ties you up in knots.</i>

353
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:52,363
And Jerry is a very sexy man.</i>

354
00:18:53,809 --> 00:18:56,369
- What?
- Look, I'm not judging you.

355
00:18:56,529 --> 00:19:00,158
In fact, we here at PBS,
we have many programs...</i>

356
00:19:00,329 --> 00:19:02,047
...celebrating your lifestyle.</i>

357
00:19:03,329 --> 00:19:05,843
Armistead Maupin's
Tales of the City...</i>

358
00:19:06,009 --> 00:19:08,762
...gender-bending and swinging
in San Francisco.</i>

359
00:19:08,929 --> 00:19:10,681
Before Stonewal,
about those dark ages...</i>

360
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:12,760
...when you couldn't
come out of the closet...</i>

361
00:19:12,929 --> 00:19:15,523
...lest you be persecuted
because of your, you know...</i>

362
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:17,008
No, I don't.

363
00:19:17,169 --> 00:19:18,602
Are you Danny Tartabull?</i>

364
00:19:19,569 --> 00:19:21,161
No, I'm not.

365
00:19:24,249 --> 00:19:25,762
I'll take care of this, Danny.</i>

366
00:19:28,689 --> 00:19:31,408
- Excuse me.
- What's the problem?</i>

367
00:19:31,569 --> 00:19:35,357
I believe you cut me off
and then made an obscene gesture.</i>

368
00:19:35,529 --> 00:19:36,962
I did? Where?</i>

369
00:19:37,129 --> 00:19:39,199
Outside of Manhattan
about an hour ago.</i>

370
00:19:40,449 --> 00:19:41,802
Is that Danny Tartabull?

371
00:19:43,089 --> 00:19:45,125
That's right.
Of the New York Yankees.</i>

372
00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:48,326
I'd like to shake his hand,
but I can't.</i>

373
00:19:52,489 --> 00:19:56,038
I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
I tell jokes for a living.</i>

374
00:19:56,209 --> 00:20:00,999
But there's no joking about
the financial crisis here at PBS.</i>

375
00:20:01,169 --> 00:20:03,683
Our lines are open,
so please call the number...</i>

376
00:20:03,849 --> 00:20:05,805
...you see on your screen.</i>

377
00:20:05,969 --> 00:20:08,847
This is the only time this year
we'll be asking for donations.</i>

378
00:20:10,249 --> 00:20:13,605
- PBS pledge drive.
- Hello. I'd like to speak with Jerry.</i>

379
00:20:13,769 --> 00:20:16,078
You again, buddy.
Look, forget about Jerry.</i>

380
00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:19,047
- It's not gonna happen.
- This is his grandmother.</i>

381
00:20:19,209 --> 00:20:21,120
Oh, Nana.

382
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:23,723
- Hello.
- Tell Jerry I'm sorry.</i>

383
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,244
I'm going to have to write
him some new checks.</i>

384
00:20:26,409 --> 00:20:28,047
As long as you got
your checkbook out...</i>

385
00:20:28,209 --> 00:20:29,961
...how about forking a little over
to PBS?</i>

386
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:32,802
You watch this station, don't you?
Don't be a freeloader.</i>

387
00:20:32,969 --> 00:20:35,529
Programs like Ken Burns' Basebal.</i>

388
00:20:35,689 --> 00:20:37,759
And if Danny Tartabull were here...</i>

389
00:20:38,289 --> 00:20:41,281
...I'm sure he'd say,
"That's correct, Jerry."</i>

390
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:43,007
Jerry. I have an announcement.</i>

391
00:20:43,169 --> 00:20:45,285
- Your grandmother is on the line.
- My nana?</i>

392
00:20:45,449 --> 00:20:50,762
And as we speak, she's generously
writing PBS a check for $1500!</i>

393
00:20:51,729 --> 00:20:56,041
She can't do that.
She's on a very fixed income.</i>

394
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:58,680
Stop the show!</i>

395
00:21:03,689 --> 00:21:05,964
I got another card from Kristin.</i>

396
00:21:06,129 --> 00:21:08,802
Not quite as chipper...</i>

397
00:21:08,969 --> 00:21:10,641
...as the first one.</i>

398
00:21:12,369 --> 00:21:15,406
- Isn't this bunny giving you the-?
- Yes, he is.</i>

399
00:21:16,089 --> 00:21:17,761
- You should show this to Georgie.
- Yeah.</i>

400
00:21:18,129 --> 00:21:20,768
- Here's your knife and fork.
- Thank you.</i>

401
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:24,046
Look, she's cutting up
an Almond Joy.</i>

402
00:21:24,209 --> 00:21:25,483
I just don't get it.</i>

403
00:21:25,649 --> 00:21:28,607
I saw someone on the street
eating M&M's with a spoon.</i>

404
00:21:31,329 --> 00:21:34,048
What is wrong with everybody?</i>

405
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:35,722
Look, they're doing it.</i>

406
00:21:36,209 --> 00:21:37,403
They're all doing it.</i>

407
00:21:39,969 --> 00:21:42,005
What is wrong with all you people?</i>

408
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:45,485
Have you all gone mad?</i>

409
