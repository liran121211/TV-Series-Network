1
00:00:02,249 --> 00:00:05,047
I find it fascinating, when you go
in the stationery store...</i>

2
00:00:06,449 --> 00:00:09,088
...that they're manufacturing
millions of pens constantly.</i>

3
00:00:09,249 --> 00:00:12,525
We're all buying them. I must have
bought 6000 Bics in my life.</i>

4
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:15,682
I've used up maybe two of them.
Where's the rest of them?</i>

5
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,840
Move a refrigerator,
there's a couple there.</i>

6
00:00:18,009 --> 00:00:22,002
But that doesn't account for it.
Where are all the pens?</i>

7
00:00:22,169 --> 00:00:24,478
That's why it's embarrassing
if you don't have one.</i>

8
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:27,641
"You got a pen? Can I borrow a pen?"
We always have to whisper...</i>

9
00:00:27,809 --> 00:00:31,006
...because it's so humiliating.
"I don't have a pen."</i>

10
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:33,365
"They're making millions
of them every week."</i>

11
00:00:33,529 --> 00:00:35,599
"I know. Where are they?"</i>

12
00:00:42,249 --> 00:00:43,682
May I help you?</i>

13
00:00:43,849 --> 00:00:47,285
Yeah, hi.
I'm looking for a Rolamech 1000.</i>

14
00:00:47,449 --> 00:00:52,569
- It's a mechanical pencil.
- Oh, I know the Rolamech 1000.</i>

15
00:00:54,569 --> 00:00:56,446
No, I'm sure you do.</i>

16
00:00:56,609 --> 00:00:58,520
They're pretty expensive.</i>

17
00:00:58,689 --> 00:01:00,600
Well, it's for my boss.</i>

18
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:02,202
What do you do?

19
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:05,203
Whatever.</i>

20
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:07,405
Well, we don't have any
in stock right now...</i>

21
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:09,799
...but I would be happy
to order it for you.</i>

22
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:11,846
Just give me your phone number...</i>

23
00:01:12,009 --> 00:01:14,682
...and when it comes in,
I'll give you a call.</i>

24
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:16,441
Your name is...?</i>

25
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:18,008
Elaine.</i>

26
00:01:18,169 --> 00:01:20,000
Elaine.</i>

27
00:01:21,769 --> 00:01:25,887
- And your last name?
- It's just Elaine. Like Cher.</i>

28
00:01:28,329 --> 00:01:30,365
And your number?</i>

29
00:01:30,529 --> 00:01:35,364
It's KL5-2390.

30
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:37,680
Okay. Thanks a lot.

31
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:40,921
- You'll be hearing from me.
- Okay. So long.</i>

32
00:01:41,089 --> 00:01:44,240
- Why did you give him my number?
- Don't worry about it.</i>

33
00:01:44,649 --> 00:01:46,321
I think he got ideas.</i>

34
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:49,447
I wonder if any woman
ever said that about Einstein.</i>

35
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,327
Just call me when
the pencil comes in.</i>

36
00:01:51,489 --> 00:01:53,764
Why does Mr. Pitt prefer
a pencil to a pen anyway?</i>

37
00:01:54,569 --> 00:01:55,797
Hey, look who's here.</i>

38
00:01:55,969 --> 00:01:57,880
Hey.</i>

39
00:01:59,529 --> 00:02:01,042
- Hi, Jerry.
- Hi, Julie.</i>

40
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:02,403
Elaine, Julie.</i>

41
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:04,799
- Hi.
- Oh, hi. Elaine's my middle name.</i>

42
00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:07,164
Mine's Ike.</i>

43
00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:09,763
Hey, wanna get some lunch?</i>

44
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,079
Just had a big bowl of Kix.

45
00:02:13,129 --> 00:02:14,528
Oh, well, that's very mature.</i>

46
00:02:14,689 --> 00:02:16,600
- What about you?
- Oh, please come, Elaine.</i>

47
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:18,725
No. Maybe you could
bring me something.</i>

48
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:22,359
- Sure, all right. What do you want?
- I don't know.</i>

49
00:02:22,529 --> 00:02:24,326
- A big salad.
- What big salad?

50
00:02:24,489 --> 00:02:26,878
- I'm going to the coffee shop.
- They have big salads.</i>

51
00:02:27,049 --> 00:02:28,721
I've never seen a big salad.</i>

52
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,041
They have big salads.</i>

53
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:34,007
Is that what I ask for,
the big salad?</i>

54
00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:37,124
- It's okay. Just forget it.
- No, hey, I'll get it.</i>

55
00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:38,961
What's in the big salad?</i>

56
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:43,202
Big lettuce, big carrots.
Tomatoes like volleyballs.</i>

57
00:02:43,529 --> 00:02:45,918
So you gonna be upstairs?
See you in a little while.</i>

58
00:02:46,089 --> 00:02:47,442
- Okay.
- Okay.

59
00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:50,605
Maybe I should just get married.</i>

60
00:02:50,889 --> 00:02:53,084
Dating really is getting
embarrassing, isn't it?</i>

61
00:02:53,249 --> 00:02:57,606
I know. Whenever I'm on a date,
I always feel like people can tell.</i>

62
00:02:57,769 --> 00:02:59,999
People on dates shouldn't be
allowed in public.</i>

63
00:03:00,169 --> 00:03:02,160
It's embarrassing for them.</i>

64
00:03:02,329 --> 00:03:03,887
It's painful for us to watch.

65
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:06,722
I'm going out with someone,
I'm not even taking her out.</i>

66
00:03:06,889 --> 00:03:09,847
- Good for you.
- I don't need people staring at us.</i>

67
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:11,840
You're telling me.</i>

68
00:03:12,969 --> 00:03:14,721
What was that?

69
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,121
Gendason. What a jerk.</i>

70
00:03:21,289 --> 00:03:24,326
I'm never playing golf
with him again.</i>

71
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:27,367
- Who? Gendason?
- Steve Gendason.</i>

72
00:03:27,529 --> 00:03:29,042
Why does that name
sound familiar?</i>

73
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,804
- He used to be a baseball player.
- How'd you end up golfing with him?</i>

74
00:03:32,969 --> 00:03:34,880
I met him on the course
a couple years ago.</i>

75
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:38,086
Yeah. Played with him a lot.
But today was it.</i>

76
00:03:38,249 --> 00:03:41,047
We're on the 15th hole.</i>

77
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:43,325
He's beating me by a couple
of strokes.</i>

78
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:45,878
Then he's about to hit
his second shot...</i>

79
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:51,282
...when he picks up the ball
and cleans it.</i>

80
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:54,959
- So what?
- Sorry.

81
00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:59,765
The rules clearly state you cannot
clean the ball unless it's on the green.</i>

82
00:03:59,929 --> 00:04:02,568
- The rules are clear about that.
- Certainly are.</i>

83
00:04:02,729 --> 00:04:05,527
- So I penalized him a stroke.
- So, what happened?</i>

84
00:04:05,689 --> 00:04:07,520
He lost it!</i>

85
00:04:08,009 --> 00:04:09,442
We almost came to blows.</i>

86
00:04:09,609 --> 00:04:11,839
We're face to face,
like a manager and an umpire.</i>

87
00:04:12,009 --> 00:04:14,239
We're like,
"Hey, what are you talking about?!</i>

88
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:19,244
- Think I'm gonna put up with that?!"
- All right. All right! You're in my face.</i>

89
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:21,042
I don't see what the big deal is.</i>

90
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:26,488
Hey, a rule is a rule. And let's face it,
without rules, there's chaos.</i>

91
00:04:29,209 --> 00:04:31,882
I like Anna Quindlen's column.
And Safire.</i>

92
00:04:32,049 --> 00:04:33,607
Don't you like Safire?</i>

93
00:04:33,769 --> 00:04:35,600
Safire.</i>

94
00:04:35,769 --> 00:04:37,680
Although he can be rather pedantic.</i>

95
00:04:37,849 --> 00:04:40,079
He can be pedantic.
He can be pedantic.</i>

96
00:04:40,929 --> 00:04:42,965
And Bob Herbert's great.</i>

97
00:04:43,289 --> 00:04:44,642
He worked for the Dai/y News.</i>

98
00:04:44,809 --> 00:04:47,687
Yes. Yes.
You know what's interesting?</i>

99
00:04:47,849 --> 00:04:51,080
The quarterback
for the Atlanta Falcons...</i>

100
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:54,798
...is Bobby Hebert, no R...</i>

101
00:04:54,969 --> 00:04:56,288
...which I find fascinating.

102
00:04:56,969 --> 00:04:58,448
You know, it's Herbert...</i>

103
00:04:58,609 --> 00:05:01,203
...H-E-R-B-E-R-T...

104
00:05:01,369 --> 00:05:05,521
...Hebert, H-E-B-E-R-T.</i>

105
00:05:06,609 --> 00:05:10,079
Hebert. It's a fun name to pronounce.
Try and say it. Hebert.</i>

106
00:05:10,569 --> 00:05:13,003
Go ahead, take a shot. Hebert.
All right.</i>

107
00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:15,000
- Thanks. I got it.
- No. I'd like to pay.</i>

108
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:17,000
Now, Julie, Julie, don't insult me.</i>

109
00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:19,729
What difference does it make
who pays? It's meaningless.</i>

110
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:22,562
- Okay, thanks, George.
- Here's your big salad to go.</i>

111
00:05:22,729 --> 00:05:24,447
Oh, thank you.

112
00:05:27,649 --> 00:05:29,446
Hello.</i>

113
00:05:29,609 --> 00:05:31,201
No, she's not here.</i>

114
00:05:32,409 --> 00:05:34,400
Okay, fine. Whatever.</i>

115
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:36,241
Yes, I'll tell her.</i>

116
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:38,047
Okay, goodbye.</i>

117
00:05:38,209 --> 00:05:42,919
Stationery-store guy called
to say he ordered your pencil.</i>

118
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:46,398
I told you. He has ideas.</i>

119
00:05:46,569 --> 00:05:50,278
- He doesn't even care if a man answers.
- Or you.</i>

120
00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:52,968
- Hey.
- Hey.</i>

121
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:54,448
Hey.</i>

122
00:05:54,609 --> 00:05:56,201
- Sorry we're late.
- It's no problem.</i>

123
00:05:56,369 --> 00:05:58,644
- Here's your big salad.
- Thank you, Julie.</i>

124
00:05:58,809 --> 00:06:00,322
You're very welcome.</i>

125
00:06:00,969 --> 00:06:03,529
So I guess I better get going.</i>

126
00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:06,078
Meeting Mother at the Guggenheim.
You don't wanna go?</i>

127
00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:08,968
No, you Guggenheim.
I'm not much of a Guggenheimer.</i>

128
00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:10,881
- You sure?
- Yeah, yeah. You go.</i>

129
00:06:11,049 --> 00:06:14,007
- Okay, I'll see you later. Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.</i>

130
00:06:19,489 --> 00:06:21,719
Did you see
what just happened here?</i>

131
00:06:22,409 --> 00:06:24,445
Well, that all depends.</i>

132
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:28,086
Did you happen to notice that Julie
handed the big salad to Elaine?</i>

133
00:06:28,929 --> 00:06:31,489
- Yeah, so?
- Well, she didn't buy the big salad.</i>

134
00:06:31,649 --> 00:06:34,209
I bought the big salad.</i>

135
00:06:34,609 --> 00:06:36,088
- Is that a fact?
- Yes, it is.</i>

136
00:06:36,249 --> 00:06:38,888
She just took credit for my salad.</i>

137
00:06:39,049 --> 00:06:40,528
- That's not right.
- No, it isn't.

138
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:42,281
- I'm the one who bought it.
- You did.</i>

139
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:44,405
- She should've said something.
- She could've.</i>

140
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:46,207
- Oh, I know.
- Imagine...</i>

141
00:06:46,369 --> 00:06:49,998
...her taking credit
for your big salad.</i>

142
00:06:50,769 --> 00:06:54,478
You buy a big salad for somebody,
it would be nice if they knew it.</i>

143
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:56,560
Obviously.

144
00:06:57,289 --> 00:06:58,483
- Turn on the TV.
- What?</i>

145
00:06:58,649 --> 00:07:00,560
Put it on. Put it on!

146
00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:04,320
Neither the district attorney's office
nor the po/ice department...</i>

147
00:07:04,489 --> 00:07:06,400
...have answered
any questions as yet.</i>

148
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:08,560
To repeat,
in case you're just joining us...</i>

149
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:11,323
...former baseba/ star
Steve Gendason has been tak en...</i>

150
00:07:11,489 --> 00:07:13,480
...to po/ice headquarters
for questioning...</i>

151
00:07:13,649 --> 00:07:17,039
...in the murder of Bobby Pinkus,
the owner of Roya/ Dry C/eaners...</i>

152
00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:20,406
...at 2759 Amsterdam Avenue.</i>

153
00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:22,048
According to Pinkus' wife...</i>

154
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:25,042
...Gendason had been inv o/ved
in a dispute with the c/eaner...</i>

155
00:07:25,209 --> 00:07:28,406
...over a stain on a pair
of grey Sansabe/t s/acks.</i>

156
00:07:28,929 --> 00:07:31,887
We a/so have a report that
ear/ier in the day...</i>

157
00:07:32,049 --> 00:07:34,324
...a groundsk eeper at
Van Cort/andt go/f course...</i>

158
00:07:34,489 --> 00:07:39,199
...reported/y saw an irate Gendason
/eaving the c/ubhouse in a huff.</i>

159
00:07:39,369 --> 00:07:41,963
Whether there is a possib/e
connection between the two...</i>

160
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,723
...is something we'/ just have
to wait and find out.</i>

161
00:07:45,849 --> 00:07:48,602
- Jerry.
- Well, it had nothing to do with you.</i>

162
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:51,329
Yeah, but maybe he was so mad
from the penalty stroke...</i>

163
00:07:51,489 --> 00:07:53,525
...that he murdered the dry cleaner.</i>

164
00:07:56,769 --> 00:07:59,408
Generally speaking,
you don't need any extra incentive...</i>

165
00:07:59,569 --> 00:08:02,322
...to murder a dry cleaner.
I wouldn't worry about it.</i>

166
00:08:05,409 --> 00:08:09,163
- I like Julie. She's very personable.
- Yeah, she's lovely.</i>

167
00:08:09,849 --> 00:08:11,760
- That's great, George.
- Yeah.</i>

168
00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:24,160
- So did you enjoy your lunch?
- Yeah. The big salad.</i>

169
00:08:24,329 --> 00:08:27,526
It was very good.
Actually, it was too big.</i>

170
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:32,328
- Why?
- Oh, no reason.</i>

171
00:08:34,009 --> 00:08:36,569
Because, you know,
she handed you the bag.</i>

172
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:38,448
I could have handed you the bag.</i>

173
00:08:38,609 --> 00:08:41,681
But she happened to picked it up
at the restaurant, even though...</i>

174
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:43,601
Even though what?</i>

175
00:08:44,889 --> 00:08:46,481
It's just...</i>

176
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:49,038
You thanked her, even though...</i>

177
00:08:50,369 --> 00:08:52,087
What's the difference?</i>

178
00:08:52,249 --> 00:08:54,399
What? What are you
trying to say, George?</i>

179
00:08:54,569 --> 00:08:58,847
It's just that I was the one
that actually paid for the big salad.</i>

180
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:02,445
She just happened to hand it to you.
But it's no big deal.</i>

181
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:04,679
You want the money
for the big salad, George?</i>

182
00:09:04,849 --> 00:09:06,646
- No, no.
- Then what is your problem?</i>

183
00:09:06,809 --> 00:09:08,720
There is no problem.</i>

184
00:09:09,929 --> 00:09:12,762
Just a small miscommunication
whereby you thanked her...</i>

185
00:09:12,929 --> 00:09:15,124
...instead of the person
actually responsible...</i>

186
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:17,928
...for the purchasing
of the big salad.</i>

187
00:09:19,329 --> 00:09:23,447
Kramer played golf with him,
and Kramer thinks a penalty stroke...</i>

188
00:09:23,609 --> 00:09:25,839
...may have driven him to it.</i>

189
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,004
Well, they haven't even
arrested him yet.</i>

190
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:31,285
Come on. Let's go out.</i>

191
00:09:31,449 --> 00:09:33,565
No, I don't think so.

192
00:09:33,929 --> 00:09:35,408
Why not?

193
00:09:35,569 --> 00:09:37,958
We don't need a bunch of people
staring at us.</i>

194
00:09:38,249 --> 00:09:40,399
- Who's staring?
- Oh, they're staring.</i>

195
00:09:40,569 --> 00:09:42,639
They know we're on a date.
They're making fun.</i>

196
00:09:42,809 --> 00:09:44,322
Come on. It's embarrassing.</i>

197
00:09:46,449 --> 00:09:48,007
Hello?</i>

198
00:09:48,369 --> 00:09:50,883
No, she's not here.</i>

199
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:52,960
Yes, I will tell her.</i>

200
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:57,647
No, I don't know what time
she might be coming back.</i>

201
00:09:57,809 --> 00:09:59,367
Look, I gotta go.

202
00:09:59,969 --> 00:10:01,800
Bye.</i>

203
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:04,529
That's... It's a long story.</i>

204
00:10:07,369 --> 00:10:08,768
Hello, Newman.</i>

205
00:10:09,369 --> 00:10:11,360
Hello, Jerry.
I was wondering if you knew...</i>

206
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:13,440
- ... where Kramer was.
- No, I don't. Why?</i>

207
00:10:13,609 --> 00:10:16,407
You know, Gendason.
This is something, isn't it?</i>

208
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:19,163
- I suppose.
- What did Kramer say?</i>

209
00:10:19,329 --> 00:10:21,797
- I don't know. Nothing.
- Come on, Jerry.</i>

210
00:10:21,969 --> 00:10:24,642
You know something.
Tell me! Tell me!</i>

211
00:10:25,329 --> 00:10:27,081
Oh, Chunkys.

212
00:10:30,689 --> 00:10:32,247
Margaret?</i>

213
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:38,366
- Hello.
- You two know each other?</i>

214
00:10:38,729 --> 00:10:40,765
You might say that.

215
00:10:41,929 --> 00:10:44,238
We used to go out.</i>

216
00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:49,446
Well, toodle-loo.</i>

217
00:10:49,609 --> 00:10:52,442
Nice seeing you again, Margaret.
Bye, Jerry.</i>

218
00:10:52,609 --> 00:10:54,565
Have fun.</i>

219
00:11:02,209 --> 00:11:05,121
You went out with Newman?</i>

220
00:11:06,089 --> 00:11:09,399
- Just a few times.
- Why?</i>

221
00:11:10,609 --> 00:11:14,682
- I liked him.
- You liked Newman?</i>

222
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:17,848
Look, I'm a little uncomfortable
talking about this, okay?</i>

223
00:11:18,049 --> 00:11:22,406
No, I'm sorry. I'm just a little curious.
Why did you stop seeing him?</i>

224
00:11:22,969 --> 00:11:24,800
He ended it.</i>

225
00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:28,920
He ended it?</i>

226
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:31,559
Yes. Yes.</i>

227
00:11:31,729 --> 00:11:34,687
It was a couple of years ago.
Why, does it matter?</i>

228
00:11:34,849 --> 00:11:37,682
No. No, of course not.</i>

229
00:11:38,729 --> 00:11:41,960
Jerry, they found a tee.</i>

230
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:47,040
- What tee?
- A golf tee in the dry cleaner.</i>

231
00:11:52,609 --> 00:11:55,806
Newman.
She went out with Newman.</i>

232
00:11:56,009 --> 00:11:58,477
- It must be a mistake.
- No. It isn't.</i>

233
00:11:58,689 --> 00:12:01,726
And the most distressing part
is not that she went out with him...</i>

234
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:03,959
...but that he stopped seeing her.</i>

235
00:12:04,929 --> 00:12:07,568
Do you understand?
He, Newman...</i>

236
00:12:07,729 --> 00:12:10,118
...Newman stopped seeing her.</i>

237
00:12:10,289 --> 00:12:11,847
Newman never stops
seeing anybody.</i>

238
00:12:12,009 --> 00:12:14,477
Newman will see
whoever is willing to see him.</i>

239
00:12:14,689 --> 00:12:17,920
So the question, then, is not
so much why did she see him...</i>

240
00:12:18,569 --> 00:12:21,083
...as disturbing as that is...

241
00:12:21,249 --> 00:12:25,208
...but why did he, Newman,
stop seeing her?</i>

242
00:12:26,489 --> 00:12:30,038
Perhaps there's more to Newman
than meets the eye.</i>

243
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:32,724
No. There's less.</i>

244
00:12:35,249 --> 00:12:37,763
- It's possible.
- No, it isn't.</i>

245
00:12:37,929 --> 00:12:39,760
I've looked into his eyes.</i>

246
00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:42,045
He's pure evil.</i>

247
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,762
Maybe he's an enigma.
A mystery wrapped in a riddle.</i>

248
00:12:45,969 --> 00:12:48,119
Yeah. He's a mystery
wrapped in a Twinkie.</i>

249
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:52,161
- Can I get you some more coffee?
- No, but thank you.</i>

250
00:12:52,329 --> 00:12:55,162
Your stationery-store guy called.
He's got your pencil.</i>

251
00:12:55,369 --> 00:12:57,929
You are kidding me.</i>

252
00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:01,718
No. He left the store early, made a
special trip to the distributor and got it.</i>

253
00:13:01,929 --> 00:13:04,079
I bought one yesterday
on 14th Street.</i>

254
00:13:04,289 --> 00:13:06,644
What did you do that for?
He already ordered it.</i>

255
00:13:06,849 --> 00:13:09,966
- I wanted to please Mr. Pitt.
- You better go down and tell this guy.</i>

256
00:13:10,129 --> 00:13:13,007
- He's very excited.
- Oh, boy.</i>

257
00:13:13,289 --> 00:13:15,007
- Oh, hi, Julie.
- Hi.</i>

258
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,648
- Hi, Julie.
- How are you, Elaine?</i>

259
00:13:16,809 --> 00:13:20,006
- I'm meeting George here.
- Well, then I better get going.</i>

260
00:13:20,169 --> 00:13:22,160
Otherwise George will make me
buy him lunch...</i>

261
00:13:22,329 --> 00:13:25,401
...to make up for that big salad
he bought me yesterday.</i>

262
00:13:25,609 --> 00:13:27,327
How do you know that?

263
00:13:29,449 --> 00:13:32,486
- Who is it?
- It's Jerry.</i>

264
00:13:33,169 --> 00:13:35,478
It's kind of a bad time.
Could you come back later?</i>

265
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,082
Come on, Newman, open the door!</i>

266
00:13:42,369 --> 00:13:44,246
Hello, Jerry.</i>

267
00:13:46,329 --> 00:13:48,843
What a treat. What brings you
down to the east wing?</i>

268
00:13:49,049 --> 00:13:52,041
Okay, pudgy, let's stop playing games.
What happened with Margaret?</i>

269
00:13:52,209 --> 00:13:54,598
Don't get excited.
Can we discuss this like gentlemen?</i>

270
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:59,320
No, we can't. My skin is crawling
just being inside your little rat's nest.</i>

271
00:14:01,009 --> 00:14:03,398
- Now, what happened?
- You wanna know what happened?</i>

272
00:14:03,569 --> 00:14:05,719
I'll tell you what happened.</i>

273
00:14:05,889 --> 00:14:08,039
She wasn't my type.</i>

274
00:14:08,409 --> 00:14:11,207
- Not your type?
- Not really.</i>

275
00:14:11,369 --> 00:14:15,248
- Well, how come?
- She just didn't do it for me.</i>

276
00:14:15,409 --> 00:14:19,641
- What is wrong with her?
- Well, if you're happy with her...</i>

277
00:14:19,809 --> 00:14:21,800
...that's all that matters.</i>

278
00:14:22,969 --> 00:14:25,961
- You don't think she's attractive?
- No.</i>

279
00:14:26,289 --> 00:14:28,723
I need a really pretty face.</i>

280
00:14:28,889 --> 00:14:31,801
But, hey, that's me.</i>

281
00:14:32,649 --> 00:14:34,765
Okay, Newman. Thanks a lot.</i>

282
00:14:34,929 --> 00:14:36,999
- Care for some lemonade?
- No, thank you.</i>

283
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:39,967
Drop by anytime, Jerry.</i>

284
00:14:43,689 --> 00:14:46,283
Jerry. All right, now, listen to this.</i>

285
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:50,126
"If a player cleans his ball
during play of a hole...</i>

286
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:54,726
...except on the putting green,
he shall incur a penalty of one stroke."</i>

287
00:14:54,889 --> 00:14:56,925
- That's the rule.
- It's just a friendly game.</i>

288
00:14:57,089 --> 00:15:00,718
- Why are you always such a stickler?
- That's the way I was raised.</i>

289
00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:04,040
When I was growing up,
I had to be in bed every night by 9:00.</i>

290
00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:08,407
And if I wasn't... Well, I don't have
to tell you what happened.</i>

291
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:12,123
What are you so worried
about this for?</i>

292
00:15:12,289 --> 00:15:14,439
You know he talked about Pinkus
on the course?</i>

293
00:15:14,609 --> 00:15:15,803
- He did?
- Oh, yeah.</i>

294
00:15:15,969 --> 00:15:19,166
He said he brought his pants to
Pinkus', and they came back stained...</i>

295
00:15:19,329 --> 00:15:21,479
...with some kind
of dry-cleaning fluid.</i>

296
00:15:21,649 --> 00:15:23,685
And Pinkus denied responsibility.</i>

297
00:15:23,849 --> 00:15:25,521
You see?
He was very upset at Pinkus.</i>

298
00:15:25,689 --> 00:15:27,486
So it had nothing to do with you.

299
00:15:27,729 --> 00:15:29,959
Yeah, but maybe I pushed him
over the edge.</i>

300
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:33,166
- No, I don't think so.
- Poor Pinkus.

301
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,885
Poor little Pinkus.</i>

302
00:15:37,649 --> 00:15:39,719
Hey, let me ask you a question.</i>

303
00:15:39,889 --> 00:15:42,357
You met Margaret.
You think Margaret's good-looking?</i>

304
00:15:42,769 --> 00:15:45,602
She's a natural beauty.
No makeup? I like that.</i>

305
00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:48,363
Yeah. And the curls?
You like the curls?</i>

306
00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:51,885
- Oh, I love curls.
- Yeah. Yeah, me too.</i>

307
00:15:52,049 --> 00:15:53,767
- I'll see you later.
- Where you going?</i>

308
00:15:53,929 --> 00:15:55,885
- Gendason's.
- You're going to see Gendason?</i>

309
00:15:56,049 --> 00:15:58,119
It's weighing on my conscience.</i>

310
00:16:00,969 --> 00:16:04,598
I think I could have played with dolls
if there were dolls in the house.</i>

311
00:16:05,009 --> 00:16:06,567
It seems like fun to me.</i>

312
00:16:06,729 --> 00:16:11,086
It doesn't seem like a gender thing.
I think I would like to play with dolls.</i>

313
00:16:11,409 --> 00:16:13,081
What's so terrible?</i>

314
00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:16,117
So, George, I was talking
to Elaine before-</i>

315
00:16:16,289 --> 00:16:18,086
We're just friends.</i>

316
00:16:19,049 --> 00:16:22,564
Yes, well, anyway, she said something
that was kind of intriguing.</i>

317
00:16:22,729 --> 00:16:23,957
Share.</i>

318
00:16:24,129 --> 00:16:27,565
Well, when I came over to the table,
she mentioned something...</i>

319
00:16:27,729 --> 00:16:31,165
...about how she'd better hurry up and
leave or you'd make her buy lunch...</i>

320
00:16:31,329 --> 00:16:34,048
...to make up for the one
you bought yesterday.</i>

321
00:16:35,569 --> 00:16:36,888
I'm not following.

322
00:16:38,009 --> 00:16:41,479
Well, my question is, how could Elaine
be under the impression...</i>

323
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:43,640
...that you bought the big salad...</i>

324
00:16:43,809 --> 00:16:45,800
...when I was the one
that handed it to her?</i>

325
00:16:47,249 --> 00:16:49,240
Well, she probably just assumed.</i>

326
00:16:50,289 --> 00:16:52,041
Did she?</i>

327
00:16:54,809 --> 00:16:56,401
Wait a second.</i>

328
00:16:57,009 --> 00:17:01,082
Are you suggesting that I went
out of my way to tell Elaine...</i>

329
00:17:01,249 --> 00:17:05,162
...that even though you handed her
the big salad, that it came from me?</i>

330
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:07,240
That's what I'm suggesting.</i>

331
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:10,804
Well, it was a big salad.</i>

332
00:17:11,729 --> 00:17:14,607
And what I would like to know
is how does a person...</i>

333
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:17,488
...who has virtually nothing
to do with the big salad...</i>

334
00:17:17,649 --> 00:17:19,765
...claim responsibility
for that salad...</i>

335
00:17:19,929 --> 00:17:23,968
...and accept a thank-you
under false pretences?</i>

336
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:29,241
George, all I did was
hand someone a bag.</i>

337
00:17:35,089 --> 00:17:37,364
It's just that my boss
is very demanding...</i>

338
00:17:37,529 --> 00:17:39,520
...and he needed the pencil
right away.</i>

339
00:17:39,689 --> 00:17:42,249
Well, why did you tell me
to order it if you knew...</i>

340
00:17:42,409 --> 00:17:44,764
...you were going to get one
someplace else?</i>

341
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:47,397
No, I didn't know. I'm sorry.

342
00:17:47,569 --> 00:17:49,799
I went all the way down
to the warehouse.</i>

343
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:52,085
It took me three hours.</i>

344
00:17:52,249 --> 00:17:54,399
I had a big fight with the foreman.</i>

345
00:17:54,729 --> 00:17:57,118
Really? A fight with the foreman?</i>

346
00:17:57,289 --> 00:18:03,159
- Yes.
- Well, again, I'm just awfully sorry.</i>

347
00:18:03,329 --> 00:18:04,762
Yeah?</i>

348
00:18:06,249 --> 00:18:08,604
Well, then how about
going out with me?</i>

349
00:18:09,369 --> 00:18:11,041
Okay.

350
00:18:15,649 --> 00:18:18,721
I mean, they found a tee.
And he played golf that day.</i>

351
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,323
Nobody walks into a dry cleaners'
with a tee.</i>

352
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,369
The circumstantial evidence
is overwhelming.</i>

353
00:18:25,009 --> 00:18:27,887
You had how many dates with him?
Three?</i>

354
00:18:28,929 --> 00:18:30,840
Around three. I don't know.</i>

355
00:18:32,489 --> 00:18:34,366
And...?

356
00:18:34,769 --> 00:18:37,158
I told you, he stopped calling me.</i>

357
00:18:37,329 --> 00:18:40,048
I moved on. I'm not hung up on him.</i>

358
00:18:43,249 --> 00:18:47,083
- What are you looking at?
- What? I'm not looking. Nothing.</i>

359
00:18:47,529 --> 00:18:49,167
Why are you looking at my face?</i>

360
00:18:50,449 --> 00:18:51,962
Where am I gonna look?</i>

361
00:18:53,489 --> 00:18:54,922
Kiss me.</i>

362
00:19:03,649 --> 00:19:05,321
I can't.

363
00:19:10,569 --> 00:19:12,082
Newman.</i>

364
00:19:14,969 --> 00:19:17,005
Newman ruined it.
All I could think of...</i>

365
00:19:17,169 --> 00:19:21,720
...when I was looking at her face was,
"Newman found this unacceptable."</i>

366
00:19:22,129 --> 00:19:25,246
I'm going out
with the stationery-store guy.</i>

367
00:19:25,969 --> 00:19:28,529
You're going out
with the stationery-store guy?</i>

368
00:19:28,689 --> 00:19:32,682
I felt so guilty about the pencil
I couldn't say no.</i>

369
00:19:35,969 --> 00:19:37,846
Well, well, well.</i>

370
00:19:39,009 --> 00:19:41,807
I'm not treating you
to lunch anymore!</i>

371
00:19:43,569 --> 00:19:46,720
You had to tell Julie that I made
a special point of telling you...</i>

372
00:19:46,889 --> 00:19:49,323
...that I bought you
the big salad, didn't you?</i>

373
00:19:51,249 --> 00:19:54,525
You know, if it was a regular salad,
I wouldn't have said anything.</i>

374
00:19:54,689 --> 00:19:58,125
But you had to have the big salad!</i>

375
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:04,361
Hello?</i>

376
00:20:04,529 --> 00:20:05,962
What?

377
00:20:06,129 --> 00:20:07,482
You're kidding.</i>

378
00:20:07,649 --> 00:20:09,207
I'm turning it on.

379
00:20:09,369 --> 00:20:12,008
Oh, my God, get out of here.</i>

380
00:20:12,529 --> 00:20:15,521
Hey, listen to this. They issued
a warrant for Gendason's arrest.</i>

381
00:20:15,689 --> 00:20:19,079
He escaped, and the police spotted
him on the New Jersey Turnpike.</i>

382
00:20:19,249 --> 00:20:23,128
As you can see,
he's in a white Ford Bronco.</i>

383
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:25,803
The po/ice have c/eared
the highway traffic in front...</i>

384
00:20:25,969 --> 00:20:27,721
...but they are k eeping
their distance.</i>

385
00:20:27,889 --> 00:20:29,800
They don't want this situation
to esca/ate.</i>

386
00:20:29,969 --> 00:20:34,042
And we have gotten an identification
on the driver of the vehic/e.</i>

387
00:20:34,209 --> 00:20:35,881
His name is Kramer...</i>

388
00:20:36,049 --> 00:20:39,405
...and he's reported/y one
of Gendason's go/fing buddies.</i>

389
00:20:41,489 --> 00:20:43,241
911, what are you reporting?</i>

390
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,923
Yeah, this is Kramer.
I got Gendason in the car.</i>

391
00:20:46,089 --> 00:20:47,681
Now, he wants to see his fish.</i>

392
00:20:47,849 --> 00:20:51,398
I'm taking him to see his fish,
so tell the police to back off.</i>

393
00:20:51,569 --> 00:20:53,639
Okay, sir. And what's your name?</i>

394
00:20:53,809 --> 00:20:57,040
My name is Kramer.
You know who I am, damn it!</i>

395
00:20:58,129 --> 00:21:01,201
- I told you not to take the turnpike.
- I thought we would blend in.</i>

396
00:21:01,409 --> 00:21:03,400
If you took the Palisades,
this wouldn't happen.</i>

397
00:21:03,569 --> 00:21:07,084
- Then we would've had bridge traffic.
- Just drive.</i>

398
00:21:14,329 --> 00:21:18,083
To me, murder doesn't even really
seem like that great of a revenge.</i>

399
00:21:18,249 --> 00:21:22,606
Wouldn't years of subtle psychological
mind games be a lot more satisfying?</i>

400
00:21:22,769 --> 00:21:25,841
Constantly calling them and hanging
up when they pick up the phone.</i>

401
00:21:26,009 --> 00:21:29,240
Sending pizzas and taxis
to their house all night long.</i>

402
00:21:29,409 --> 00:21:33,084
After a while they go, "I wish this guy
would kill me. I can't take it anymore!"</i>

403
00:21:34,849 --> 00:21:37,488
How come when the police
catch some really bad criminal...</i>

404
00:21:37,649 --> 00:21:40,368
...they put him in the handcuffs,
hit him with the baton...</i>

405
00:21:40,529 --> 00:21:44,044
...put the chokehold on him, but then
they don't want him to hurt his head...</i>

406
00:21:44,209 --> 00:21:46,279
...when they're putting him
in the patrol car.</i>

407
00:21:46,449 --> 00:21:50,647
"Watch your head. Don't hit that
metal edge there. That really hurts."</i>

408
