1
00:00:04,249 --> 00:00:07,321
If a friend gets into in a relationship,
it affects your friendship.</i>

2
00:00:07,489 --> 00:00:10,447
Because you're like a comedy team,
and now there's a third person.</i>

3
00:00:10,609 --> 00:00:12,759
It throws off the timing:
"Who's on first?"</i>

4
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:17,400
"I don't know.
Dear, who do you think is on first?"</i>

5
00:00:18,649 --> 00:00:21,846
Whenever a friend starts with
a new girlfriend, he should just say:</i>

6
00:00:22,009 --> 00:00:23,806
"I look like the person
you used to know...</i>

7
00:00:23,969 --> 00:00:27,325
...but I've been modified
to survive in this relationship.</i>

8
00:00:27,489 --> 00:00:30,128
In other words, if we're arguing
and she's there...</i>

9
00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:32,200
...I may say,
'I totally disagree with you. '</i>

10
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:33,358
But what that means is:</i>

11
00:00:33,529 --> 00:00:37,078
'I'd like to help you out, but I'd rather
continue to see her naked."'</i>

12
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:45,798
Okay, cowboys, what will you have?</i>

13
00:00:45,969 --> 00:00:48,529
I'll have the turkey club
without the bacon.</i>

14
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:51,966
And I'll have the bacon club
without the turkey.</i>

15
00:00:52,769 --> 00:00:54,839
George, don't make me
get tough with you.</i>

16
00:00:55,169 --> 00:00:57,080
Why? You think you can
beat me up?</i>

17
00:00:57,249 --> 00:01:00,605
You wouldn't want me to mess up
that beautiful face of yours.</i>

18
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:02,999
Stop it. Stop it.

19
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:07,126
You don't want bacon.
I'll surprise you.</i>

20
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:11,327
- Is she not terrific?
- She does have a way.</i>

21
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:13,798
You think she thinks
I have a beautiful face?</i>

22
00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:16,437
Well, they do work on tips.</i>

23
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:19,848
"George, don't make me
get tough with you."</i>

24
00:01:20,889 --> 00:01:23,483
Who says that? She is really cool.</i>

25
00:01:23,649 --> 00:01:25,401
What do you think?
Think she likes me?</i>

26
00:01:25,569 --> 00:01:27,639
I should've got the egg-white omelette.</i>

27
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:31,718
Why should she like me? Who am I?
There's a million people to like.</i>

28
00:01:31,889 --> 00:01:34,767
The omelette. Damn.</i>

29
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:37,397
Maybe she could like me.
Is it that far-fetched?</i>

30
00:01:37,569 --> 00:01:40,129
Maybe she sees something.
Is it possible?</i>

31
00:01:40,289 --> 00:01:43,247
- No. Not possible.
- No. Not possible.</i>

32
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:46,082
- Hey.
- Hey, Laney.</i>

33
00:01:46,249 --> 00:01:48,922
- How was the trip?
- What trip? You were gone?</i>

34
00:01:49,089 --> 00:01:51,205
I went to England.</i>

35
00:01:51,809 --> 00:01:54,039
With Mr. Pitt, for five days?</i>

36
00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:58,280
- How was it?
- Actually, it was great.</i>

37
00:01:58,449 --> 00:02:01,805
I met an Englishman,
and we really hit it off.</i>

38
00:02:02,169 --> 00:02:04,842
That relationship has obviously
got a lot of potential.</i>

39
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:06,237
Yeah, well, Jerome...</i>

40
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:10,084
...I happen to be flying him in
on my frequent-flier miles.</i>

41
00:02:10,249 --> 00:02:13,082
Flying him in?
How long is he staying for?</i>

42
00:02:13,249 --> 00:02:16,719
It's an open-ended ticket.
He can return any time he wants.</i>

43
00:02:16,889 --> 00:02:18,845
All this in five days.</i>

44
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:21,000
Oh, no. It's Kenny Bania.</i>

45
00:02:21,169 --> 00:02:23,922
- Who's he?
- He's this awful comedian.</i>

46
00:02:24,089 --> 00:02:26,125
- Hey, Jerry.
- Hey, Kenny.</i>

47
00:02:27,009 --> 00:02:29,364
- Elaine, George.
- Hi.</i>

48
00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:32,522
- How's it going?
- Great. I've been working out.</i>

49
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:34,520
Went from a size 40 to a 42.</i>

50
00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:37,409
- No kidding?
- Yeah. I'm huge.</i>

51
00:02:39,249 --> 00:02:41,319
- I'll leave you guys alone.
- Okay, thanks.</i>

52
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:45,406
Oh, Jerry, you know
what just hit me? I was thinking-</i>

53
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:48,208
- What size suit are you?
- I'm a 40. Why?</i>

54
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:51,600
I just got a brand-new Armani suit,
doesn't fit me anymore. You want it?</i>

55
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:53,318
Well, I don't know if-</i>

56
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:55,320
Come on.
Why should it sit in a closet?</i>

57
00:02:55,489 --> 00:02:58,765
- An Armani suit?
- Take the suit.</i>

58
00:02:59,649 --> 00:03:02,686
Well, okay, I guess.</i>

59
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,680
- You gonna be home later?
- Yeah.</i>

60
00:03:04,849 --> 00:03:06,919
I'll drop it off.

61
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:11,403
- Hey, new suit!
- Yeah, yeah. Lucky me.</i>

62
00:03:11,809 --> 00:03:14,448
Here, I personally made you
a cold chicken sandwich.</i>

63
00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:15,883
It's not even on the menu.</i>

64
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:19,445
Oh, this is fabulous.

65
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:21,722
Boy, she is nice.</i>

66
00:03:21,889 --> 00:03:24,357
I like her. I like her, Jerry.
She's got substance.</i>

67
00:03:24,529 --> 00:03:26,326
She oozes substance.</i>

68
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:28,923
Well, go in there and talk to her.</i>

69
00:03:29,089 --> 00:03:31,284
She's not gonna put them
on the glass.</i>

70
00:03:32,289 --> 00:03:34,359
You mean the walk back in?</i>

71
00:03:34,529 --> 00:03:36,565
That's the toughest move
in the business.</i>

72
00:03:36,969 --> 00:03:38,607
You're sending me
into no man's land...</i>

73
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:40,919
...and if I get shot down,
I have to crawl back.</i>

74
00:03:41,249 --> 00:03:42,602
I can't do it, I tell you!</i>

75
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:46,045
Pull yourself together.
You're going in there, soldier.</i>

76
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:47,847
That's an order!</i>

77
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:51,558
Get in there.</i>

78
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:56,722
- Hey.
- Hey.</i>

79
00:03:56,889 --> 00:03:58,368
I need you to do me a favour.</i>

80
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:00,520
- What?
- Help me move my refrigerator.</i>

81
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:02,441
- Why?
- Because I'm getting rid of it.</i>

82
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:08,606
- Yeah?
- It's K.B. I have the suit.</i>

83
00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:10,760
All right, come on up.</i>

84
00:04:10,929 --> 00:04:13,159
- So...
- Why get rid of your refrigerator?</i>

85
00:04:13,329 --> 00:04:15,559
After that kidney stone,
I only want fresh food.</i>

86
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:19,563
It's gotta be fresh.
I'm not eating any more stored food.</i>

87
00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:21,321
Plus, you know, I want the space.</i>

88
00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:24,765
- What for?
- Well, I could put a dresser in there.</i>

89
00:04:24,929 --> 00:04:27,762
I could get dressed
while I'm making breakfast.</i>

90
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:29,158
Hey!</i>

91
00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:32,008
- Here you go.
- Yeah.</i>

92
00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:34,603
Didn't think I was gonna
give you a suit, did you?</i>

93
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:37,363
- You're giving him this suit?
- That's right. It's Armani.</i>

94
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:39,008
Armani?

95
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:42,605
- Hey, Armani, Jerry.
- Yes, yes, I heard.</i>

96
00:04:42,769 --> 00:04:44,646
- Come on, try it on.
- No, it's okay.</i>

97
00:04:44,809 --> 00:04:47,164
- Come on. I want to see how it fits.
- All right.</i>

98
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,559
- There you go.
- There, okay?</i>

99
00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:51,720
Oh, boy. Look at that.
That looks great.</i>

100
00:04:52,289 --> 00:04:56,202
- I can't believe you're giving him this.
- And I don't even want anything for it.</i>

101
00:04:59,329 --> 00:05:02,765
- He's very generous, isn't he?
- Yes. Yes, he is.</i>

102
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:05,683
I'll tell you what, you can take me
to dinner sometime.</i>

103
00:05:08,049 --> 00:05:09,528
- Dinner?
- Yeah, buy me a meal.</i>

104
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:12,601
- Can't get a better deal than that.
- You'll never get a better deal.</i>

105
00:05:12,769 --> 00:05:15,158
- All right, I'll leave you alone.
- Yeah, yeah.</i>

106
00:05:15,329 --> 00:05:17,320
Look at that. Armani. Yeah.</i>

107
00:05:17,489 --> 00:05:19,957
Yeah, that's a deal.
That's a terrible deal.</i>

108
00:05:20,129 --> 00:05:24,122
I don't want to go out to dinner
with him. I'd rather make my own suit.</i>

109
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:26,441
- I did it. It's all done.
- Hey.</i>

110
00:05:26,609 --> 00:05:28,918
I did it. We're going out
when she gets off work.</i>

111
00:05:29,089 --> 00:05:30,317
And it'll still be daytime.</i>

112
00:05:30,489 --> 00:05:33,049
I'm better in the daytime than at night.
It's less pressure.</i>

113
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:34,688
I love the day date.</i>

114
00:05:34,849 --> 00:05:36,726
- No wine, no shower.
- There you go.</i>

115
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:41,087
- So the trip was good?
- Yes.</i>

116
00:05:41,249 --> 00:05:43,319
Apart from that dreadful airline food.</i>

117
00:05:43,489 --> 00:05:45,684
Wreaked absolute havoc
with my stomach.</i>

118
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:49,486
You know, I have to say,
I've never admitted this to anyone...</i>

119
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:53,324
...but I kind of like airline food.</i>

120
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,962
That's probably because of...</i>

121
00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:00,801
What?

122
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:05,160
- What?
- Yeah, what?</i>

123
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:08,727
What?

124
00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:11,005
Where I come from,
we don't say "what."</i>

125
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:13,558
It's proper to say "pardon."</i>

126
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:17,239
Oh, this should be interesting.</i>

127
00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:20,128
- Pardon?
- Nothing.

128
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:25,721
So then, about a year ago, I started
selling these funky little hair clips.</i>

129
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:29,518
It's going pretty good.
I make them in my apartment.</i>

130
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:32,806
I'm just waitressing because I wanted
to go to Europe this summer...</i>

131
00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:35,244
...and I could use a few extra-
Careful.</i>

132
00:06:35,409 --> 00:06:39,322
Oh, it's just horse manure.
Horse manure's not that bad.</i>

133
00:06:39,489 --> 00:06:41,639
I don't even mind
the word "manure."</i>

134
00:06:41,809 --> 00:06:43,765
You know, it's "nure,"
which is good...</i>

135
00:06:43,929 --> 00:06:46,841
...and a "ma"in front of it.
Manure.</i>

136
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:51,321
When you consider the other choices,
"manure"is actually pretty refreshing.</i>

137
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:54,959
- That's a nice watch, George.
- Yeah.</i>

138
00:06:55,129 --> 00:06:57,597
You know, my boyfriend
has the same one.</i>

139
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,080
- Really?
- Yeah, he loves watches.</i>

140
00:07:01,249 --> 00:07:03,843
- He's a real watch freak.
- Well, how about that?</i>

141
00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:07,888
- Oh, look out. You stepped right in it.
- Yes. I sure did.</i>

142
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:12,206
So you just pretended
it didn't bother you?</i>

143
00:07:12,369 --> 00:07:14,599
What is that? Boyfriend?
I don't understand that.</i>

144
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:17,408
What does she think
I asked her out for?</i>

145
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:20,527
It's the way they just slip it
in there too.</i>

146
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:23,522
Yeah, like it's all just part
of the conversation.</i>

147
00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:26,886
"My boyfriend really likes watches.
He's a real watch freak."</i>

148
00:07:27,049 --> 00:07:30,325
Well, that's fabulous.</i>

149
00:07:31,489 --> 00:07:34,845
Well, let me ask you this. What exactly
did you say when you asked her out?</i>

150
00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:37,763
I said, "Would you like
to go for a walk or something?"</i>

151
00:07:37,929 --> 00:07:42,844
- Oh, a walk? Well...
- Or something. I said "or something."</i>

152
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:45,481
Or something?</i>

153
00:07:45,649 --> 00:07:47,879
- Yeah, that's a date.
- There you go.</i>

154
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:51,720
Of course, there is always the
possibility that she called an audible.</i>

155
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:54,198
- What do you mean?
- She got to the line of scrimmage...</i>

156
00:07:54,369 --> 00:07:57,406
...didn't like the looks of the defence
and changed the play.</i>

157
00:08:00,329 --> 00:08:04,288
I think things were going okay.
We were having a nice conversation.</i>

158
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:06,838
I mentioned how I liked
horse manure.</i>

159
00:08:08,649 --> 00:08:11,163
- You did?
- Yeah.</i>

160
00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:15,081
- You said you liked horse manure?
- Yeah.</i>

161
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:19,679
You know, about how, when you break
it down, it's a very positive thing.</i>

162
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:23,319
You know, you have a "nure"
with a "ma"in front of it.</i>

163
00:08:23,489 --> 00:08:27,164
Manure. It's not bad.</i>

164
00:08:27,649 --> 00:08:30,038
It was around this point
she mentioned the boyfriend?</i>

165
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:31,642
Yeah.</i>

166
00:08:34,329 --> 00:08:36,797
Oh, you think because
of what I said about the manure?</i>

167
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:40,723
I was saying how it takes a negative
thing and puts a positive spin on it.</i>

168
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:43,881
I'm just saying there's a chance
she may not have been enamoured...</i>

169
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:47,086
...with your thoughts and feelings
on manure.</i>

170
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:49,480
So you don't think
she has a boyfriend.</i>

171
00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:51,480
My honest opinion?
I think she made it up.</i>

172
00:08:52,329 --> 00:08:54,638
Well, then she's just a liar,
isn't she?</i>

173
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:57,041
Hey.</i>

174
00:08:57,729 --> 00:08:59,447
You want something to eat,
don't you?</i>

175
00:08:59,609 --> 00:09:01,679
Oh, no, no, no.
You got me all wrong, buddy.</i>

176
00:09:01,849 --> 00:09:05,444
I am loving this no refrigerator.
You know what I discovered?</i>

177
00:09:05,609 --> 00:09:10,637
I really like depriving myself of things.
It's fun. Very monastic.</i>

178
00:09:10,969 --> 00:09:12,846
- Well, what do you eat?
- It's all fresh.</i>

179
00:09:13,009 --> 00:09:17,719
Fresh fish, fresh fowl, fresh fruit.
I buy it. I eat it.</i>

180
00:09:18,129 --> 00:09:20,927
- Well, I'm glad it's working out.
- Oh, yeah. It's working out.</i>

181
00:09:21,089 --> 00:09:23,887
And I got a date with that waitress
who works at Reggie's.</i>

182
00:09:24,329 --> 00:09:27,639
Boy, if I could meet a hostess,
we could open up our own place.</i>

183
00:09:28,129 --> 00:09:31,007
Yeah. Well, I'll tell you,
she's a full-figured gal.</i>

184
00:09:31,489 --> 00:09:34,128
- Is she?
- Oh, you better believe it, buddy.</i>

185
00:09:34,889 --> 00:09:37,483
- George, we could double sometime.
- Yeah, yeah, we could.</i>

186
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:40,209
You know, Kramer,
the next time you talk to her...</i>

187
00:09:40,369 --> 00:09:42,439
...find out if she knows Kelly
from Monk's.</i>

188
00:09:42,609 --> 00:09:44,520
I want to know
if she has a boyfriend.</i>

189
00:09:44,689 --> 00:09:46,680
All right, let's get over here.</i>

190
00:09:46,849 --> 00:09:48,760
- Hello.
- Hi, Jerry. It's Kenny.</i>

191
00:09:48,929 --> 00:09:51,807
- Oh, hi.
- I was thinking, if you're not busy...</i>

192
00:09:51,969 --> 00:09:53,960
...maybe I can get my meal today?</i>

193
00:10:03,809 --> 00:10:06,482
Yeah, you want to get that meal,
don't you?</i>

194
00:10:07,249 --> 00:10:09,479
How about Mendy's.
Ever been there?</i>

195
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:11,321
- No, I haven't.
- You're gonna love it.</i>

196
00:10:11,489 --> 00:10:13,719
- I'll meet you there around 7.
- All right.</i>

197
00:10:15,369 --> 00:10:17,519
Yeah, I really needed that suit.</i>

198
00:10:18,809 --> 00:10:21,403
I start off with curls.
That's good for the bicep.</i>

199
00:10:21,569 --> 00:10:23,719
I do 10 reps, two sets.</i>

200
00:10:24,289 --> 00:10:26,200
That's fantastic.

201
00:10:26,369 --> 00:10:27,927
- You work out with weights?
- I don't.</i>

202
00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:30,205
- You should.
- Why?

203
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:37,078
- You worn the suit yet?
- No, not yet.</i>

204
00:10:37,249 --> 00:10:40,446
- Have you decided?
- Oh, get the swordfish.</i>

205
00:10:40,609 --> 00:10:43,487
Best swordfish in the city.
The best, Jerry.</i>

206
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:45,719
I'll have the salmon.</i>

207
00:10:45,969 --> 00:10:47,004
And you?

208
00:10:47,169 --> 00:10:49,967
You know what I think?
I'm just gonna have soup.</i>

209
00:10:50,129 --> 00:10:52,848
Yeah, I'll save the meal
for another time.</i>

210
00:10:57,089 --> 00:11:00,047
Another time? What other time?</i>

211
00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:03,007
I had a hot dog earlier.
I'm not that hungry.</i>

212
00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:05,364
No, no, Bania, no.

213
00:11:05,849 --> 00:11:09,728
This is the dinner.
The soup counts.</i>

214
00:11:14,209 --> 00:11:16,518
Soup's not a meal.
You're supposed to buy me a meal.</i>

215
00:11:16,689 --> 00:11:19,647
I'm not stopping you from eating.
Go ahead. Get anything you want.</i>

216
00:11:19,809 --> 00:11:23,438
- But I don't want anything but soup.
- Then that's the meal.</i>

217
00:11:24,329 --> 00:11:25,318
But I had the hot dog.</i>

218
00:11:25,489 --> 00:11:27,605
Who told you to have a hot dog?</i>

219
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:30,761
Hey, I give you
a brand-new Armani suit...</i>

220
00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:32,521
...and you won't even
buy me a meal.</i>

221
00:11:35,249 --> 00:11:39,162
All right, fine. Get the soup.</i>

222
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:44,207
So he just gets soup.
He wants to save the meal.</i>

223
00:11:44,369 --> 00:11:46,007
So now I got to do it
all over again.</i>

224
00:11:46,169 --> 00:11:48,080
What kind of soup did he get?</i>

225
00:11:48,569 --> 00:11:50,844
I don't know.
Consommé or something.</i>

226
00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:53,318
- Consommé.
- What?

227
00:11:53,489 --> 00:11:55,605
Well, that's really not a meal, Jerry.</i>

228
00:11:55,769 --> 00:11:59,125
I mean, if he had gotten
chicken gumbo or matzo ball...</i>

229
00:11:59,289 --> 00:12:01,519
...even mushroom barley,
then I'd agree with you.</i>

230
00:12:01,689 --> 00:12:03,486
Those are very hearty soups.</i>

231
00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:06,038
- You're missing the whole point.
- What?</i>

232
00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:08,245
The meal is the act
of sitting down with him.</i>

233
00:12:08,409 --> 00:12:09,762
It doesn't matter what you get.</i>

234
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:12,887
As long as he's sitting
in that restaurant, it's a meal.</i>

235
00:12:13,049 --> 00:12:15,768
- Was it a cup or a bowl?
- You see? Again.</i>

236
00:12:15,929 --> 00:12:18,762
- I'm just curious.
- A bowl, okay?

237
00:12:18,929 --> 00:12:20,840
Did he crumble any crackers in it?</i>

238
00:12:22,289 --> 00:12:24,519
Did he crumble any crackers in it?</i>

239
00:12:24,689 --> 00:12:26,361
As a matter of fact, he did.</i>

240
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:31,683
Oh, well, crackers in a bowl.
That could be a meal.</i>

241
00:12:32,929 --> 00:12:36,080
It's like I'm talking
to my aunt Sylvia here.</i>

242
00:12:36,449 --> 00:12:39,839
- Hi, Simon. This is Jerry.
- Hello.</i>

243
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,921
- Elaine, do you have cash on you?
- Yeah, in my purse.</i>

244
00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:45,000
No, there was only $6.</i>

245
00:12:46,289 --> 00:12:49,087
Well, I have some money.
What do you need?</i>

246
00:12:49,249 --> 00:12:51,717
Twenty should cover me.
Thanks, mate.</i>

247
00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:55,279
- Where are you going?
- Just visiting.</i>

248
00:12:55,449 --> 00:12:58,839
- Okay. See you later.
- I won't be back for dinner.</i>

249
00:13:00,289 --> 00:13:02,200
Pardon?

250
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:07,877
- So is she working? Is she here?
- Yeah, she's here.</i>

251
00:13:08,049 --> 00:13:10,279
- Have you said anything?
- No. I'm very uncomfortable.</i>

252
00:13:10,449 --> 00:13:12,883
- Are you gonna say anything?
- I don't know.</i>

253
00:13:13,049 --> 00:13:14,448
- Hello.
- Hello.</i>

254
00:13:14,609 --> 00:13:16,759
Well, what's it going to be?</i>

255
00:13:17,969 --> 00:13:21,245
- "What's it gonna be?"
- Yes. What will you have?</i>

256
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:24,082
Are you eating?
It's in that vein.</i>

257
00:13:25,129 --> 00:13:28,963
- I'll just have a bowl of chilli.
- I'll have an egg-white omelette.</i>

258
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:33,362
- "What's it gonna be?"Hear that?
- Yeah, that was bad.</i>

259
00:13:33,529 --> 00:13:34,678
Did you feel that tension?</i>

260
00:13:34,849 --> 00:13:37,158
We used to have banter.
There's no more banter.</i>

261
00:13:37,329 --> 00:13:41,288
Oh, no. It's Kenny.
Slide out so he can't sit here.</i>

262
00:13:43,369 --> 00:13:45,439
- Hey.
- Hey.</i>

263
00:13:46,489 --> 00:13:48,127
- You worn the suit?
- Actually I did.</i>

264
00:13:48,289 --> 00:13:50,678
I put it on last night
and slept in it.</i>

265
00:13:52,329 --> 00:13:55,127
- You did?
- No, I'm joking.

266
00:13:58,089 --> 00:14:00,125
Can I squeeze in?</i>

267
00:14:00,289 --> 00:14:02,086
Sure you can.</i>

268
00:14:05,449 --> 00:14:06,643
Thanks.

269
00:14:06,809 --> 00:14:10,279
- Can I take your order?
- What kind of soup do you have?</i>

270
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:12,679
Why don't you get a sandwich.</i>

271
00:14:12,849 --> 00:14:16,080
Okay. I'll have tomato soup
and tuna on toast.</i>

272
00:14:16,249 --> 00:14:19,639
Okay. This is it, you know.

273
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:24,885
This is the meal.
So stock up, buddy boy.</i>

274
00:14:26,609 --> 00:14:28,725
What are you talking about?
This isn't a meal.</i>

275
00:14:28,889 --> 00:14:32,279
Yes, it is. Soup and sandwich.
That is a meal.</i>

276
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:36,398
You're supposed to buy me dinner
in a nice restaurant like Mendy's.</i>

277
00:14:36,569 --> 00:14:39,720
- I tried to do that.
- This is lunch in a coffee shop.</i>

278
00:14:39,889 --> 00:14:42,687
It doesn't matter. This is it.
This completes the transaction.</i>

279
00:14:43,169 --> 00:14:46,639
Oh, soup and a sandwich
for a brand-new Armani suit.</i>

280
00:14:46,809 --> 00:14:49,881
- Is that any kind of a gesture?
- I'm really not comfortable-</i>

281
00:14:50,049 --> 00:14:52,722
Hey, I just spoke to Hildy
about your friend.</i>

282
00:14:52,889 --> 00:14:54,402
- Yeah?
- She doesn't have a boyfriend.</i>

283
00:14:54,569 --> 00:14:55,888
She made it up.</i>

284
00:15:06,449 --> 00:15:07,438
- Hi.
- Hi.

285
00:15:07,609 --> 00:15:09,804
- Where's Simon?
- Oh, he'll be right up.</i>

286
00:15:09,969 --> 00:15:12,437
He's just getting some beer.</i>

287
00:15:12,609 --> 00:15:16,124
And I'm not expecting any change.</i>

288
00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:18,966
- When's he leaving?
- About two days.</i>

289
00:15:19,129 --> 00:15:21,768
Although he's hinting
at how he'd like to stay.</i>

290
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:25,558
Fortunately, he has no money
and no prospects.</i>

291
00:15:25,729 --> 00:15:28,402
- Hey, mate. Fancy a beer?
- No, thanks.</i>

292
00:15:31,729 --> 00:15:32,798
Hello?</i>

293
00:15:32,969 --> 00:15:36,359
No, I'm sorry, Bania.
I'm not going over this again.</i>

294
00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:39,202
Well, who told you to order soup?</i>

295
00:15:39,369 --> 00:15:43,328
No, there's no dinner.
There's not going to be any dinner.</i>

296
00:15:43,489 --> 00:15:47,528
You've had a sandwich
and two bowls of soup, and that's it.</i>

297
00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:50,887
Goodbye.</i>

298
00:15:52,169 --> 00:15:54,205
- Hey, what size suit are you?
- Forty.</i>

299
00:15:54,369 --> 00:15:56,280
Forty. Perfect.</i>

300
00:15:56,449 --> 00:15:59,168
- Brand-new Armani suit, you want it?
- Absolutely.</i>

301
00:15:59,329 --> 00:16:01,968
Great. It's yours.
I can't stand the sight of it.</i>

302
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:04,245
- Elaine, here's the car keys.
- Thanks.</i>

303
00:16:05,729 --> 00:16:07,128
- Yep.
- Listen, Jerry.</i>

304
00:16:07,289 --> 00:16:10,167
I been doing some thinking.
I want my suit back.</i>

305
00:16:10,329 --> 00:16:12,126
I don't have your suit.
I gave it away.</i>

306
00:16:12,289 --> 00:16:15,884
- Wel, it's my suit.
- Well, it's gone.</i>

307
00:16:16,049 --> 00:16:18,324
I'm sorry. Goodbye, Bania.</i>

308
00:16:18,969 --> 00:16:20,607
- Hey.
- Hey.</i>

309
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:21,918
Yeah.</i>

310
00:16:23,369 --> 00:16:25,246
- Well, how's everything?
- Okay.</i>

311
00:16:25,409 --> 00:16:26,728
Good.

312
00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:29,119
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

313
00:16:29,729 --> 00:16:31,128
Really?</i>

314
00:16:32,289 --> 00:16:33,881
You want food, don't you?

315
00:16:34,209 --> 00:16:37,485
It's not for me, it's for Hildy,
the waitress I was telling you about.</i>

316
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:39,446
She's hungry. She wants food.</i>

317
00:16:39,609 --> 00:16:43,318
If I go back in there without any food,
there's gonna be trouble.</i>

318
00:16:44,449 --> 00:16:47,009
All right, go ahead.</i>

319
00:16:50,889 --> 00:16:52,561
- Did you find anything?
- Yeah.</i>

320
00:16:53,769 --> 00:16:56,408
There's a few things in here.
Peanut butter, cheese. Yeah.</i>

321
00:16:56,569 --> 00:16:58,321
- Cheese is good. What kind?
- Swiss.</i>

322
00:16:58,489 --> 00:17:00,366
All right, it'll have to do. Come on.</i>

323
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,003
What are you doing out here?</i>

324
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:05,205
I can't go in there.
I'm too uncomfortable.</i>

325
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:07,007
We're not gonna go
in there anymore?</i>

326
00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:09,718
Hey, what are you doing out here?</i>

327
00:17:09,889 --> 00:17:12,608
We can't eat here,
because he took a waitress for a walk.</i>

328
00:17:12,769 --> 00:17:15,488
What's the difference?
Let's go to Reggie's.</i>

329
00:17:15,649 --> 00:17:19,005
- Reggie's? I can't eat anything there.
- It's the same menu.</i>

330
00:17:19,169 --> 00:17:21,160
There's no big salad.</i>

331
00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:23,448
They'll make you a big salad.</i>

332
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:26,806
What do you think, they're
the only ones that make a big salad?</i>

333
00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:30,759
All right, let's go to Reggie's.</i>

334
00:17:32,329 --> 00:17:34,365
So, what's going on with Simon?
Did he leave?</i>

335
00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:36,918
Wait till you hear this.</i>

336
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:39,728
So Simon picks this woman up
right in front of me.</i>

337
00:17:39,889 --> 00:17:42,198
Look. They make a point
of saying on the menu:</i>

338
00:17:42,369 --> 00:17:44,439
"No egg-white omelettes."
Look at that.</i>

339
00:17:44,609 --> 00:17:47,919
So what? Have a yolk.
It won't kill you.</i>

340
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:50,127
- Hello.
- Oh, hi, Hildy.</i>

341
00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:51,961
Could I get an egg-white omelette?</i>

342
00:17:52,129 --> 00:17:56,122
- Did you read the menu?
- All right. Just give me a western.</i>

343
00:17:56,449 --> 00:18:00,078
- How about a big salad?
- A big salad?

344
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:02,721
- See?
- Just tell her what you want.</i>

345
00:18:02,889 --> 00:18:04,004
They'll make it for you.</i>

346
00:18:04,929 --> 00:18:08,604
It's a salad, only bigger,
with lots of stuff in it.</i>

347
00:18:09,729 --> 00:18:12,289
I can bring you two small salads.

348
00:18:12,689 --> 00:18:14,680
Could you put it in a big bowl?

349
00:18:14,849 --> 00:18:16,840
We don't have big bowls.</i>

350
00:18:17,009 --> 00:18:20,365
- All right, just give me a cup of decaf.
- We have Sanka.</i>

351
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:25,763
It's not fair.
I've been going there for seven years.</i>

352
00:18:25,929 --> 00:18:27,806
- She's been there three weeks.
- Not fair.</i>

353
00:18:27,969 --> 00:18:30,608
If anyone should be forced to leave,
it should be her.</i>

354
00:18:30,769 --> 00:18:32,441
She's on your turf.</i>

355
00:18:32,609 --> 00:18:36,079
If only she could get fired.
Is there any way that could happen?</i>

356
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:38,683
I mean, I know how
to get myself fired.</i>

357
00:18:40,489 --> 00:18:42,525
- You're the best.
- Well...</i>

358
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:44,122
How do I get someone else fired?</i>

359
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,278
Well, as I see it...</i>

360
00:18:45,449 --> 00:18:48,122
...you've got to apply the principles
that get you fired...</i>

361
00:18:48,289 --> 00:18:51,406
...but redirected outwardly.</i>

362
00:18:52,129 --> 00:18:53,164
Hey, hey.</i>

363
00:18:53,329 --> 00:18:54,318
She's hungry, Jerry.</i>

364
00:18:54,489 --> 00:18:56,400
There's nothing left.
There's no food.</i>

365
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:57,558
No food?

366
00:18:57,729 --> 00:19:01,688
Well, you gotta have something.
I can't go back in there with no food.</i>

367
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,328
She expecting something, Jerry.</i>

368
00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:06,887
You don't know what she's like
when that blood sugar drops.</i>

369
00:19:07,369 --> 00:19:10,167
There, you see, she's already
in a bad mood. She just got fired.</i>

370
00:19:10,369 --> 00:19:11,484
Why did she get fired?</i>

371
00:19:11,649 --> 00:19:13,685
I called over there a couple
of times...</i>

372
00:19:13,849 --> 00:19:15,646
...and the manager didn't like it.</i>

373
00:19:21,649 --> 00:19:23,162
Simon is definitely going back now.</i>

374
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,638
He's meeting me here
to return my keys.</i>

375
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:28,084
Boy, he's a real bounder, isn't he?</i>

376
00:19:28,449 --> 00:19:31,725
Yes, he's one of those bounders.</i>

377
00:19:32,049 --> 00:19:35,644
- Egg-white omelette, big salad.
- Thank you.</i>

378
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:38,118
I wanted you guys to know
that Friday is my last day.</i>

379
00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:40,245
Bloomingdale's ordered
a bunch of my clips.</i>

380
00:19:40,409 --> 00:19:42,206
Thank God. I don't have
to do this anymore.</i>

381
00:19:46,369 --> 00:19:49,759
Hey, Jerry. Where's my suit?</i>

382
00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:52,124
I don't have it.
You want half my omelette?</i>

383
00:19:52,289 --> 00:19:54,678
I told you, she's busy.</i>

384
00:19:54,849 --> 00:19:57,761
She can't come to the phone now.</i>

385
00:19:59,809 --> 00:20:01,561
Tell your boyfriend
to stop calling here.</i>

386
00:20:01,729 --> 00:20:02,718
He's not my boyfriend.</i>

387
00:20:02,889 --> 00:20:05,847
It's that bald guy with the glasses
who's always here with them.</i>

388
00:20:06,009 --> 00:20:08,284
He's trying to get me in trouble.</i>

389
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:14,689
Hey! Yeah.</i>

390
00:20:14,849 --> 00:20:16,123
I got a message for you.</i>

391
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:18,121
You tell your friend George...</i>

392
00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:20,484
...that the next time
I see him around here...</i>

393
00:20:20,649 --> 00:20:24,847
...I'm gonna turn him into my own
personal hand puppet.</i>

394
00:20:26,569 --> 00:20:29,447
Well, hello.
Here you are, as promised.</i>

395
00:20:29,609 --> 00:20:31,327
You see, I'm a man of my word.</i>

396
00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:35,160
- When are you leaving?
- Are you trying to get rid of me?</i>

397
00:20:36,249 --> 00:20:39,559
I was supposed to leave tomorrow, but
I've been set up with a job interview...</i>

398
00:20:39,729 --> 00:20:42,289
...that might enable me to extend
my visit indefinitely.</i>

399
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:45,009
And it is all due to this suit.</i>

400
00:20:45,409 --> 00:20:47,161
How do I look?

401
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:51,117
I'm a shoo-in, aren't I?
Thanks again, hon.</i>

402
00:20:52,089 --> 00:20:54,125
Hey, Kenny. You still
wanna get that suit back?</i>

403
00:20:54,289 --> 00:20:56,245
- Yeah.
- There it goes.</i>

404
00:20:56,409 --> 00:20:59,207
Hey! Hey!</i>

405
00:20:59,929 --> 00:21:01,123
Come here, you.</i>

406
00:21:01,289 --> 00:21:03,928
- Wait, what are you-? Unhand me!
- Take it off!</i>

407
00:21:59,089 --> 00:22:01,080
