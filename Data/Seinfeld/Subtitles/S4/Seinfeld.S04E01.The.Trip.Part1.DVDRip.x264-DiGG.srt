1
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:03,847
It's amazing to me
that people move...

2
00:00:05,449 --> 00:00:07,360
...thousands of miles away
to another city.

3
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:09,724
They think nothing of it.
They get on a plane.

4
00:00:09,889 --> 00:00:11,766
They live there now.

5
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:14,045
Just a thousand miles-
I'm living over there.

6
00:00:14,209 --> 00:00:17,007
You know, pioneers- It took years
to cross the country.

7
00:00:17,169 --> 00:00:21,003
Now people will move thousands
of miles just for one season.

8
00:00:21,169 --> 00:00:23,125
I don't think any pioneers did that.

9
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:25,484
"Yeah, it took us a decade
to get there...

10
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:27,207
...and we stayed for the summer.

11
00:00:27,369 --> 00:00:30,008
It was nice. It had a pool.
The kids loved it.

12
00:00:30,169 --> 00:00:33,320
And then we left about 10 years ago,
and we just got back.

13
00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:35,605
We had a great summer.
It took us 20 years...

14
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:37,680
...and now our lives are over."

15
00:00:42,729 --> 00:00:44,959
- Kramer was on Murphy Brown?
- Yeah.

16
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:46,528
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

17
00:00:47,409 --> 00:00:49,240
Murphy Brown, the TV show?

18
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:51,400
Come on, will you?

19
00:00:51,569 --> 00:00:56,359
Kramer was on Murphy Brown?
That son of a gun.

20
00:00:56,529 --> 00:00:58,724
- It's something, isn't it?
- With Candice Bergen.

21
00:00:58,889 --> 00:01:01,084
- I know.
- I've always liked her.

22
00:01:01,249 --> 00:01:02,807
Remember her
in Carnal Knowledge?

23
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:05,403
- Sure.
- She show her breasts in that?

24
00:01:05,929 --> 00:01:08,079
She's not really the naked type.

25
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:10,161
I can't believe I missed Kramer.

26
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:12,161
He asked me to go with him.

27
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:14,719
- He did?
- Yeah. I turned him down.

28
00:01:14,929 --> 00:01:17,648
- Why didn't you tell me?
- He asked me to keep it a secret.

29
00:01:17,809 --> 00:01:19,481
- You can't keep a secret.
- I know.

30
00:01:19,649 --> 00:01:22,482
This was a record. My previous
record was when Jodi Hirsch...

31
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:24,924
...asked me not to tell anybody
we slept together.

32
00:01:25,089 --> 00:01:27,398
I kept a lid on that
for about 28 seconds.

33
00:01:27,849 --> 00:01:30,283
- Well, you've come a long way.
- I've matured.

34
00:01:30,449 --> 00:01:32,360
The Tonight Show
called and they want me...

35
00:01:32,529 --> 00:01:35,726
...to do the show on the 28th.
They're giving me free tickets to L.A.

36
00:01:35,889 --> 00:01:37,368
You wanna go?

37
00:01:37,529 --> 00:01:38,928
A free ticket?

38
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:41,445
Yeah. In fact, we could
track down Kramer.

39
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:44,328
I always felt bad about the way
he left. That was a mess.

40
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:46,923
I never should've taken back
those keys.

41
00:01:47,089 --> 00:01:49,557
- What about accommodations?
- All taken care of.

42
00:01:49,929 --> 00:01:52,204
Is there a meal allowance?

43
00:01:52,369 --> 00:01:54,121
What about seat assignments?

44
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:57,087
Could I have the kosher meal?
I hear the kosher meal is good.

45
00:01:57,249 --> 00:02:00,002
And I need clothes.
I gotta get a haircut.

46
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:02,604
And I have to refill
my allergy medication.

47
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:05,559
Do I need a hat?
I need a hat, don't I?

48
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:08,841
Could we do the Universal tour?
They have that Backdraft exhibit.

49
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:10,488
Now, that looks very cool to me.

50
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:14,927
See, my acting technique-
My personal acting technique...

51
00:02:15,289 --> 00:02:18,326
...is working with colour.
Imagining colour...

52
00:02:18,529 --> 00:02:21,123
...and then finding the emotional,
vibrational mood...

53
00:02:21,289 --> 00:02:22,768
...connected to the colour.

54
00:02:23,169 --> 00:02:25,808
If you look through my scripts
you'll see that my lines...

55
00:02:25,969 --> 00:02:29,359
...have a special colour.
So I don't memorize the language.

56
00:02:29,529 --> 00:02:33,681
I memorize colour. This way, I can
go through red, yellow, green, blue.

57
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:36,886
And you have a full palette
of emotions.

58
00:02:37,049 --> 00:02:38,448
Hey.

59
00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:40,839
Didn't I tell you to get out of here?

60
00:02:41,009 --> 00:02:42,283
- Did you?
- Let's go.

61
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:44,360
- I was just-
- Yeah, you were just nothing.

62
00:02:44,529 --> 00:02:46,121
Come on, let's go.

63
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:48,127
We'll talk about this a little later.

64
00:02:48,289 --> 00:02:50,359
- Let's go.
- Are you an actor?

65
00:02:51,609 --> 00:02:53,440
See you, Mike!

66
00:03:12,649 --> 00:03:15,561
- Murphy Brown.
- Yeah, Candice Bergen, please.

67
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,447
Who's caling, please?

68
00:03:17,609 --> 00:03:19,884
Well, just tell her that it's Kramer.

69
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:24,207
All right, I'll- I'll call her at home.

70
00:03:25,809 --> 00:03:28,198
Here. Go ahead. It's all yours.

71
00:03:28,929 --> 00:03:32,399
- Hello, Kramer.
- Oh, Helene. How are you?

72
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:36,080
I haven't worked since 1934.
How do you think I am?

73
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:38,240
Well, that's only...

74
00:03:38,729 --> 00:03:41,607
- Fifty-eight years.
- It was a Three Stooges short.

75
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:43,043
"Sappy Pappies."

76
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:45,439
I played Mr. Sugarman's secretary,
remember?

77
00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:47,565
Right, yeah.
That was a Shemp, right?

78
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:49,799
No, no. Curly.

79
00:03:49,969 --> 00:03:52,164
The boys played three sailors
who find a baby.

80
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:55,048
The baby's been kidnapped,
and the police think they did it.

81
00:03:55,489 --> 00:03:57,286
- Right.
- Of course, they didn't do it.

82
00:03:57,449 --> 00:03:59,565
The police have made
an awful mistake.

83
00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:01,799
Moe hits Curly with an axe.

84
00:04:01,969 --> 00:04:04,483
- The Stooges catch the kidnappers.
- Right.

85
00:04:04,649 --> 00:04:06,480
- But it's too late.
- Really?

86
00:04:06,649 --> 00:04:09,243
- The baby's dead.
- Really?

87
00:04:09,409 --> 00:04:12,526
The boys are sent to death row
and are executed.

88
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:14,520
Well, I don't remember that part.

89
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:16,441
I play Mr. Sugarman's secretary.

90
00:04:16,609 --> 00:04:18,918
Oh, yeah, yeah. You were very good.

91
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:22,126
It was sad for a Three Stooges,
what with the dead baby...

92
00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:24,678
...and the Stooges
being executed and all.

93
00:04:24,849 --> 00:04:27,841
Yeah, well, that was an unusual
choice for the Stooges.

94
00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:31,361
Would you like to buy me
a fat-free frozen yoghurt at the store?

95
00:04:31,529 --> 00:04:33,645
Well, you know, I can't right now,
you know.

96
00:04:33,809 --> 00:04:35,083
I got a very big meeting.

97
00:04:35,249 --> 00:04:37,638
I got these people interested
in my movie treatment.

98
00:04:37,809 --> 00:04:39,720
So we'll have to make it another time.

99
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:42,483
No! No, no, don't go up there,
Kramer. They'll hurt you.

100
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:45,641
You'll never make it in this town.
You're too sensitive, like me.

101
00:04:45,809 --> 00:04:48,369
Helene, you're wrong.
You know, I'm not that sensitive.

102
00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:52,358
I was engaged to Mickey Rooney.
He left me at the altar.

103
00:04:52,769 --> 00:04:54,327
Kramer.

104
00:04:54,489 --> 00:04:56,764
Kramer!

105
00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:05,885
- What is this?
- What?

106
00:05:06,049 --> 00:05:08,927
We're going on a two-day trip.
What are you, Diana Ross?

107
00:05:10,249 --> 00:05:13,559
I happen to dress based on mood.

108
00:05:14,769 --> 00:05:17,363
But you essentially wear
the same thing all the time.

109
00:05:17,529 --> 00:05:19,804
Seemingly. Seemingly.

110
00:05:20,049 --> 00:05:23,405
But within that basic framework,
there are many subtle variations...

111
00:05:23,569 --> 00:05:25,924
...only discernible
to an acute observer...

112
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:28,523
...that reflect the many moods,
the many shades...

113
00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:30,884
...the many sides
of George Costanza.

114
00:05:31,049 --> 00:05:34,246
- What mood is this?
- This is "morning mist."

115
00:05:38,849 --> 00:05:41,204
What do you figure? Twenty?

116
00:05:41,369 --> 00:05:43,803
- Twenty-one?
- Close enough.

117
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,880
Forensics ought to be able
to nail it down.

118
00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:47,801
- No ID?
- No ID.

119
00:05:47,969 --> 00:05:51,359
- No witnesses?
- Just the trees, Johnny.

120
00:05:51,529 --> 00:05:53,485
Just the trees.

121
00:05:54,209 --> 00:05:55,847
Pretty young thing.

122
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:57,922
She was.

123
00:05:58,089 --> 00:05:59,568
Not anymore.

124
00:06:00,049 --> 00:06:01,846
Somebody saw to that.

125
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:03,886
Sure did, Johnny.

126
00:06:04,249 --> 00:06:06,319
Damn shame too.

127
00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:08,162
What do you make of it?

128
00:06:08,329 --> 00:06:09,842
I don't know.

129
00:06:11,249 --> 00:06:13,080
But I don't like it.

130
00:06:18,369 --> 00:06:20,519
Look at this guy.
He's like a cat burglar.

131
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:24,443
He thinks if he goes through real slow,
the machine won't detect him.

132
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:27,322
I've always been nervous
about going through these things.

133
00:06:27,489 --> 00:06:29,719
I'm afraid I'm gonna step
into another dimension.

134
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,720
Just go.

135
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:35,728
I made it.

136
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:38,198
Empty your pockets, please.

137
00:06:38,609 --> 00:06:41,077
Walk through again, please.

138
00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:43,080
Are you sure you don't
have metal on you?

139
00:06:43,249 --> 00:06:46,559
- Bracelets, rings, anklets?
- Anklets? No.

140
00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:48,321
- A lot of men wear anklets.
- Really?

141
00:06:48,489 --> 00:06:50,798
- Yeah.
- What do you have in your bag, sir?

142
00:06:51,049 --> 00:06:52,528
- My bag?
- Step over here, please.

143
00:06:52,689 --> 00:06:55,249
- Over here?
- Do you have a knife in the bag?

144
00:06:55,569 --> 00:06:57,241
A knife?

145
00:06:57,569 --> 00:06:59,605
Open the bag, please.

146
00:07:02,969 --> 00:07:04,766
- What's this?
- Moisturizer.

147
00:07:05,249 --> 00:07:06,967
For your wife?

148
00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:09,125
No. I...

149
00:07:09,369 --> 00:07:11,041
I use it.

150
00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:14,004
Spread your arms and legs, please.

151
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:20,677
Ladies and gentlemen,
I implore you.

152
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:23,561
Have a good trip.

153
00:07:24,329 --> 00:07:25,603
- All right.
- That's it?

154
00:07:25,769 --> 00:07:27,043
- That's it.
- All right.

155
00:07:27,209 --> 00:07:28,483
Come on, Jerry, let's go.

156
00:07:29,489 --> 00:07:32,447
- What was that all about?
- I must have iron-rich blood.

157
00:07:32,609 --> 00:07:34,361
- Here we go. L.A.
- The coast.

158
00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:35,803
La-la land.

159
00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:38,039
- I got the window seat, right?
- Who said that?

160
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:39,767
- I called it.
- Oh, no.

161
00:07:39,929 --> 00:07:43,285
It seems to me that the closest thing
we have to royalty in America...

162
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:45,838
...are the people that get
to ride in those carts...

163
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:47,402
...through the airport.

164
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:50,003
Don't you hate these things?
They come out of nowhere.

165
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:53,400
Beep-beep."Cart people.
Look out. Cart people. Look out."

166
00:07:53,569 --> 00:07:55,958
We all scurry out of the way
like worthless peasants.

167
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:58,920
"It's cart people.

168
00:07:59,089 --> 00:08:01,159
I hope we didn't slow you down.

169
00:08:01,329 --> 00:08:05,447
Wave to the cart people, Timmy.
They're the best people in the world."

170
00:08:05,849 --> 00:08:08,238
You know, if you're too fat,
slow and disoriented...

171
00:08:08,409 --> 00:08:12,038
...to get to your gate on time,
you're not ready for air travel.

172
00:08:12,209 --> 00:08:14,677
I hate the people that get
onto the moving walkway...

173
00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:16,840
...and then just stand there.

174
00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:18,965
Like it's a ride.

175
00:08:19,129 --> 00:08:22,838
"Excuse me, there's no animated
pirates or bears along the way here.

176
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:26,160
Do your legs work at all?"

177
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:44,922
Yeah, I'm here for the audition.

178
00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:47,478
Which audition? The music video,
the horror movie...

179
00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:49,480
...the exercise tape,
or the infomercial?

180
00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:55,246
Let's see. Well...

181
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:32,125
You scream good.

182
00:09:32,809 --> 00:09:34,322
You too.

183
00:09:39,569 --> 00:09:43,005
- So can I keep this treatment?
- Oh, yeah, yeah. I got 20 copies.

184
00:09:43,169 --> 00:09:45,558
Because I can show it
to my manager.

185
00:09:45,729 --> 00:09:48,118
He has connections with
West German television money.

186
00:09:48,289 --> 00:09:51,486
Yeah, they're trying to put together
a miniseries for me on Eva Braun.

187
00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:53,685
I mean, think about it.
Is that a great idea?

188
00:09:53,849 --> 00:09:57,125
We know nothing about Eva Braun,
only that she was Hitler's girlfriend.

189
00:09:57,289 --> 00:09:59,484
What was it like having sex
with Adolf Hitler?

190
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:02,846
What do you wear in a bunker?
What did her parents think of Hitler...

191
00:10:03,009 --> 00:10:05,477
- ... as a potential son-in-law?
- Wait, hold on.

192
00:10:05,969 --> 00:10:08,199
Look who's over there.
Don't look, don't look.

193
00:10:08,369 --> 00:10:10,121
It's Fred Savage.

194
00:10:10,729 --> 00:10:13,197
- Big deal.
- He'd be perfect for my movie.

195
00:10:14,249 --> 00:10:16,365
This is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

196
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:22,197
I gotta go over there. I gotta give him
a copy of my treatment.

197
00:10:22,369 --> 00:10:23,927
Why are you breathing so hard?

198
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:26,125
I'm just a little nervous.

199
00:10:26,289 --> 00:10:28,564
Okay, I gotta relax.

200
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:32,806
All right. Wish me luck, huh?

201
00:10:38,609 --> 00:10:40,361
Hey. Oh, did I frighten you?

202
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:42,838
I'm not crazy. I look weird,
but I'm just like you.

203
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:45,648
I'm just a regular guy trying
to make it in this business.

204
00:10:46,009 --> 00:10:48,079
I really like your work. The...

205
00:10:48,249 --> 00:10:50,001
- Thank you.
- I can't remember the name.

206
00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:52,325
- My mind's a blank. I'm nervous.
- That's okay.

207
00:10:52,489 --> 00:10:53,763
- You know...
- Just relax.

208
00:10:53,929 --> 00:10:56,045
Okay, yeah. But I got-

209
00:10:56,529 --> 00:10:58,565
Stupid table.
I'm not normally like this.

210
00:10:58,729 --> 00:11:01,368
Usually I'm cool and charming.
I don't mean to bother you.

211
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:04,362
It's fate that you're here
at the same time as me.

212
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:06,247
It's fate. You can't avoid your fate.

213
00:11:06,409 --> 00:11:08,525
I got this treatment
I think you'd be great in.

214
00:11:08,689 --> 00:11:10,725
- I'll give it to you.
- Yeah, okay. Thank you.

215
00:11:10,889 --> 00:11:12,641
Excuse me.
Oh, wait. Are you going now?

216
00:11:12,809 --> 00:11:14,128
- Bye.
- Wait, wait.

217
00:11:18,729 --> 00:11:22,404
Yeah, that's Kramer. K-R-A-M-E-R.

218
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:26,726
I don't know, wavy. George, how
would you describe Kramer's hair?

219
00:11:27,169 --> 00:11:28,841
- Curly.
- Wavy.

220
00:11:29,169 --> 00:11:31,364
- What did you ask me for?
- Yeah. I'll hold on.

221
00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:34,123
George, did you see a piece
of paper on the nightstand...

222
00:11:34,289 --> 00:11:36,803
- ... like, crumpled up like a napkin?
- No.

223
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:39,962
Because I had three jokes on it.
They were perfectly worded...

224
00:11:40,129 --> 00:11:41,801
...just the way I wanted to have it.

225
00:11:41,969 --> 00:11:43,721
I can't find it.

226
00:11:43,889 --> 00:11:45,288
Hello?

227
00:11:45,449 --> 00:11:47,246
Hey, a shoe-buffing machine.

228
00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:50,367
I don't know, 6'3"?
George, how tall is Kramer?

229
00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:52,724
You got your own shampoo,
conditioner...

230
00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:56,325
Body lotion, Jerry, body lotion.

231
00:11:56,489 --> 00:11:59,481
- About 6'3".
- A shower cap.

232
00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:02,526
Come in.

233
00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:07,406
Hello. I have more towels.

234
00:12:07,689 --> 00:12:12,205
Oh, good, good. Come in, come in.
Welcome. I'm George.

235
00:12:12,409 --> 00:12:14,559
- Hello.
- Hi. And this is Jerry...

236
00:12:14,729 --> 00:12:17,323
...over there on the phone.
That's Jerry. And you are...?

237
00:12:17,489 --> 00:12:19,957
- Lupe.
- Lupe. That's very nice.

238
00:12:20,129 --> 00:12:22,438
Are you gonna be making the bed
in the morning?

239
00:12:22,729 --> 00:12:24,242
- Oh, yes.
- Fine, excellent.

240
00:12:24,409 --> 00:12:26,400
Could you do me a favour?

241
00:12:26,569 --> 00:12:29,402
Could you not tuck the blankets in?

242
00:12:29,569 --> 00:12:31,400
Because I can't sleep all tucked in.

243
00:12:31,569 --> 00:12:33,161
- Oh, yes, yes.
- Yes.

244
00:12:33,329 --> 00:12:35,399
I like to just be able
to take the blankets...

245
00:12:35,569 --> 00:12:38,163
...and swish them and swirl them.
You know what I mean?

246
00:12:38,329 --> 00:12:41,719
You know, I don't like them
all tucked in. I just don't.

247
00:12:41,889 --> 00:12:45,564
I like to have a lot of room. I like
to have my toes pointed up in the air.

248
00:12:45,729 --> 00:12:48,038
I just like to scrunch up the blankets.

249
00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:50,803
Yes, yes. It's too tight to sleep.

250
00:12:50,969 --> 00:12:53,164
Exactly. You know
what I'm talking about, right?

251
00:12:53,369 --> 00:12:55,485
Yes. It's too tight.

252
00:12:56,369 --> 00:12:59,202
- Him too?
- You want your blankets tucked in?

253
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,167
- What?
- Want your blankets tucked in?

254
00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:03,365
- What blankets?
- When Lupe makes up the beds.

255
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:05,485
I don't know. Whatever they do.

256
00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:07,241
I tuck in, yes?

257
00:13:07,409 --> 00:13:09,240
Tuck in. Tuck in.

258
00:13:09,409 --> 00:13:12,845
All right. So that's one tuck
and one no-tuck.

259
00:13:13,049 --> 00:13:14,926
- Okay.
- Yes. One second, sweetheart.

260
00:13:15,329 --> 00:13:17,240
Jerry, it'd be easier if you didn't tuck.

261
00:13:17,649 --> 00:13:20,038
Excuse me. Fine.
You don't want me to tuck...

262
00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:22,165
...put me down for a no-tuck.

263
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:24,166
It's two no-tucks.

264
00:13:24,609 --> 00:13:28,045
Hang on a second. You know what?
Changed my mind. Make it a tuck.

265
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:31,839
- You just said you weren't tucking.
- I'm tucking.

266
00:13:32,129 --> 00:13:35,883
Hello? Hello? They hung up on me.

267
00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:37,841
They don't know
where Kramer is anyway.

268
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:42,446
Alrighty. So that's one tuck
and one no-tuck. You got that?

269
00:13:44,009 --> 00:13:47,001
Excuse me. Did you see a piece
of paper on the nightstand here...

270
00:13:47,169 --> 00:13:49,160
...earlier today,
crumpled up like a napkin?

271
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:52,480
Oh, yes, yes. I throw away
when we clean the room.

272
00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:54,480
- Oh, okay. Thanks.
- Thank you.

273
00:13:54,649 --> 00:13:57,117
Thank you. All right, Lupe,
bye-bye now.

274
00:13:57,289 --> 00:13:58,722
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

275
00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:01,119
I can't believe she threw that out.

276
00:14:01,609 --> 00:14:05,045
I had the perfect wording of a joke
I was gonna do about the airport.

277
00:14:05,209 --> 00:14:08,121
I was gonna do it on The Tonight Show.
Now I can't remember it.

278
00:14:08,289 --> 00:14:10,280
What did you want?
You left it on the table.

279
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:12,485
They're not supposed
to throw everything out.

280
00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:16,005
Hey, hey!
It's not Lupe's fault.

281
00:14:16,169 --> 00:14:18,160
- You shouldn't have left it out.
- All right.

282
00:14:18,329 --> 00:14:20,604
Get your thing together
and let's get out of here.

283
00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:24,523
All right. Now, what mood am I in?
What mood am I-?

284
00:14:24,689 --> 00:14:26,759
- You shouldn't have tucked.
- I like it tucked.

285
00:14:26,929 --> 00:14:29,318
Nobody tucks anymore.

286
00:14:47,729 --> 00:14:49,128
- Hey, lieutenant?
- Yeah.

287
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:51,484
This was found on her person.

288
00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:53,446
On her person?

289
00:14:53,969 --> 00:14:57,644
- What kind of expression is that?
- I don't know, sir. Police lingo.

290
00:14:57,809 --> 00:14:59,083
Oh, yeah?

291
00:14:59,969 --> 00:15:01,448
What's your name, son?

292
00:15:01,929 --> 00:15:04,204
- Ross.
- Ross.

293
00:15:04,369 --> 00:15:07,088
- You see that person there, Ross?
- Yes, sir.

294
00:15:07,249 --> 00:15:08,602
She's dead.

295
00:15:08,769 --> 00:15:10,282
- Have you got that?
- Yes, sir.

296
00:15:10,449 --> 00:15:11,723
Good.

297
00:15:11,969 --> 00:15:14,358
Get out before you find yourself
on transit patrol...

298
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:17,726
...writing tickets to senior citizens
with fake bus passes.

299
00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:19,368
Yes, sir.

300
00:15:24,849 --> 00:15:27,409
I think we just caught a break.

301
00:15:30,449 --> 00:15:32,280
This is very exciting.

302
00:15:32,489 --> 00:15:35,401
You're on The Tonight Show. NBC.
Who else is on the show?

303
00:15:35,569 --> 00:15:37,719
- I don't know.
- You might meet a celebrity.

304
00:15:37,889 --> 00:15:39,720
I can't believe she threw out
my napkin.

305
00:15:39,889 --> 00:15:42,801
What are you worried about?
You know it.

306
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:46,399
- You're gonna be all right here?
- Yeah. Go about your business.

307
00:15:46,569 --> 00:15:49,481
- I'll just wander around.
- All right. Don't wander too far.

308
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:54,279
- I'll meet you back here in 15 minutes.
- Go, go. Don't worry about me.

309
00:16:05,849 --> 00:16:07,123
Hey.

310
00:16:08,049 --> 00:16:09,801
Corbin Bernsen.

311
00:16:10,329 --> 00:16:11,921
How you doing?

312
00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:17,961
- Big fan. Big fan.
- Thank you.

313
00:16:20,369 --> 00:16:22,929
- Hey, you grew a beard, huh?
- Yeah.

314
00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:26,445
Yeah. Yeah, I'm doing a movie
during my hiatus.

315
00:16:26,769 --> 00:16:28,566
Hey, you know...

316
00:16:28,769 --> 00:16:32,205
Do I have a case for you guys
to do on L.A. Law.

317
00:16:33,049 --> 00:16:34,402
Really.

318
00:16:36,009 --> 00:16:39,684
So mind you, at this point, I'm only
going out with her two, three weeks.

319
00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:43,962
So she goes out of town,
and she asks me to feed her cat.

320
00:16:44,929 --> 00:16:50,799
So, at this time, there's a lot of stuff
going on in my life...

321
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:54,803
...and it slips my mind
for a few days.

322
00:16:54,969 --> 00:16:57,437
Maybe a week. Not even a week.
Five, six days.

323
00:16:57,609 --> 00:16:59,486
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So, what happened?

324
00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:03,437
Well, it's the damnedest thing.

325
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:05,799
The cat dies.

326
00:17:07,169 --> 00:17:11,082
So she comes back. She finds the cat,
lying on the carpet, stiff as a board.

327
00:17:11,249 --> 00:17:13,968
- So you killed the cat?
- That's what she says.

328
00:17:14,129 --> 00:17:16,438
I say, "Listen...

329
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:20,318
It was an old cat.
It died of natural causes."

330
00:17:20,489 --> 00:17:24,767
So get this. Now she tells me
that I gotta buy her a brand-new cat.

331
00:17:25,289 --> 00:17:28,087
I say, "Listen, honey,
first of all...

332
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:31,878
...it was a pretty old cat. I'm not
gonna buy you a brand-new cat...

333
00:17:32,049 --> 00:17:33,801
...to replace an old dying cat.

334
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:36,164
And second of all,
I go out to the garbage...

335
00:17:36,329 --> 00:17:38,604
...I find you a new cat
in 15 seconds."

336
00:17:38,769 --> 00:17:42,603
I say, "You show me an autopsy report
that says this cat died of starvation...

337
00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:44,919
...I spring for a new cat."

338
00:17:45,129 --> 00:17:48,007
So she says something to me,
like, I don't know...

339
00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:51,241
"Get the hell out of here."
And she breaks up with me.

340
00:17:52,369 --> 00:17:55,645
Now, don't you think that would be
a great case on L.A. Law?

341
00:17:59,409 --> 00:18:01,445
I don't wanna tell you
how to run your show-

342
00:18:01,609 --> 00:18:02,928
No, of course not.

343
00:18:03,089 --> 00:18:05,557
It's enough with the bar already,
you know?

344
00:18:05,969 --> 00:18:08,119
Have they thought
about changing the setting?

345
00:18:08,289 --> 00:18:09,563
Doubt it. I doubt it. Yeah.

346
00:18:09,729 --> 00:18:11,720
People do meet in places
besides a bar.

347
00:18:11,889 --> 00:18:13,322
Well, yeah, they do.

348
00:18:13,489 --> 00:18:15,878
What about a rec room, huh?

349
00:18:16,049 --> 00:18:19,041
- Or a community centre.
- You ought to write one of those.

350
00:18:19,209 --> 00:18:21,439
I'll bring it up with the producers.
I gotta...

351
00:18:21,609 --> 00:18:24,681
Fabulous. I'll think about that,
George. Thank you.

352
00:18:25,489 --> 00:18:27,161
- How's it going?
- Great, great.

353
00:18:27,329 --> 00:18:30,685
I actually just had two meaningful,
intelligent conversations...

354
00:18:30,849 --> 00:18:32,680
...with Corbin Bernsen
and George Wendt.

355
00:18:32,849 --> 00:18:35,568
- Really?
- Yeah. Not fan talk. Not gushing.

356
00:18:35,729 --> 00:18:38,926
You know? Actual conversation.
I was incredibly articulate.

357
00:18:39,969 --> 00:18:42,608
You got toilet paper
on your heel there.

358
00:18:47,369 --> 00:18:49,678
It's The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.

359
00:18:49,849 --> 00:18:52,807
Tonight Jay welcomes
Corbin Bernsen, George Wendt...

360
00:18:52,969 --> 00:18:55,483
...and comedian, Jerry Seinfeld.

361
00:18:57,289 --> 00:19:00,679
Oh, yeah. People are always trying
to give me a great case for L.A. Law.

362
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:03,363
Just a few seconds ago,
right outside in the hallway...

363
00:19:03,529 --> 00:19:06,089
...this nut, some sick nut
comes up to me...

364
00:19:06,249 --> 00:19:09,719
...and says he was supposed
to watch this girl's cat...

365
00:19:09,889 --> 00:19:13,086
...while she was away out of town.
Anyway, he forgets to feed the cat.

366
00:19:13,249 --> 00:19:15,922
The cat dies, starves to death.
He kills the cat.

367
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:17,966
Refuses to get her a new one.

368
00:19:18,129 --> 00:19:20,438
Won't give her any money,
won't pay her.

369
00:19:20,609 --> 00:19:22,998
And he wants Arnie Becker
to represent him. Nice guy.

370
00:19:23,169 --> 00:19:25,160
Yeah, that'd make a great case
for L.A. Law.

371
00:19:25,569 --> 00:19:27,241
Thanks a lot.

372
00:19:28,809 --> 00:19:32,802
He's a very handsome man.
Passionate, intense.

373
00:19:33,609 --> 00:19:36,123
But troubled, strange.

374
00:19:36,289 --> 00:19:38,803
I think he may be in love with me.

375
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:42,882
Of course, there's nothing abnormal
about that. I have many suitors.

376
00:19:43,169 --> 00:19:45,399
It's funny, because
even after all these years...

377
00:19:45,569 --> 00:19:49,448
...we still get people giving us advice
how to improve the show.

378
00:19:49,609 --> 00:19:52,601
Actually, a few moments ago,
I ran into a nut back there...

379
00:19:52,769 --> 00:19:55,044
...who said that maybe
we should think about...

380
00:19:55,209 --> 00:19:57,769
...you know, not doing the show
in a bar.

381
00:20:02,289 --> 00:20:05,565
So that's when I said,
"Hey, Kramer, dude...

382
00:20:05,729 --> 00:20:08,038
...you ever kill a man before?"

383
00:20:08,329 --> 00:20:11,127
And he said,
"What do you think, junior?

384
00:20:11,329 --> 00:20:15,242
These hands have been
soaking in Ivory Liquid?"

385
00:20:15,409 --> 00:20:17,479
That guy you talked to,
what did he look like?

386
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:21,244
- Short little bald guy with glasses.
- That's the same guy I talked to.

387
00:20:21,409 --> 00:20:23,400
Never ends, does it?

388
00:20:23,929 --> 00:20:28,798
So I'm going through the airport,
and I put my bag on that little...

389
00:20:28,969 --> 00:20:31,642
The... The conveyor belt.

390
00:20:37,489 --> 00:20:39,684
Issue an arrest warrant.
Put out an APB.

391
00:20:39,849 --> 00:20:41,885
Let's pick up this...

392
00:20:42,129 --> 00:20:43,642
...Kramer.

393
00:20:45,169 --> 00:20:48,366
- I was terrible.
- What, are you crazy? You were fine.

394
00:20:48,529 --> 00:20:50,599
I couldn't remember
what I was trying to say.

395
00:20:50,769 --> 00:20:52,885
- That whole thing about the...
- Conveyor belt.

396
00:20:53,049 --> 00:20:55,722
Yeah. Because she threw out
my napkin.

397
00:20:56,369 --> 00:20:58,564
I can't believe-
You're blaming Lupe?

398
00:20:58,729 --> 00:21:02,085
Yes. Lupe. I'm blaming Lupe.

399
00:21:03,249 --> 00:21:05,319
There's been a break...

400
00:21:05,489 --> 00:21:09,004
...in the so-caled Smog Stranglings.
Police have just released a photo...

401
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:12,081
...of the suspect being sought
in connection with the slaying.

402
00:21:12,249 --> 00:21:16,208
He is known only as Kramer.

403
00:21:20,689 --> 00:21:22,805
Talk show hosts
never seem to have any idea...

404
00:21:22,969 --> 00:21:24,925
...how much time is left in the show.

405
00:21:25,089 --> 00:21:27,478
They're always looking off-camera:
"Do we have time?

406
00:21:27,649 --> 00:21:29,048
How are we doing on time?

407
00:21:29,209 --> 00:21:31,882
Anybody know what the time is?
What's the time?"

408
00:21:32,049 --> 00:21:34,563
You never see Magnum P.I. go,
"Should I strangle him...

409
00:21:34,729 --> 00:21:36,447
...or are we gonna take a break here?

410
00:21:36,609 --> 00:21:39,328
Can you stay for another beating?
I'll bop him in the head.

411
00:21:39,489 --> 00:21:41,081
We'll do a commercial, come back...

412
00:21:41,249 --> 00:21:43,365
...I'll drive the car real fast.
Stay with us."
