1
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:06,398
<i>The tuxedo is a woman's view
that men are all the same.</i>

2
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:08,446
<i>We might as well
dress them that way.</i>

3
00:00:09,289 --> 00:00:12,964
<i>To me, a wedding is the joining
together of a beautiful, glowing bride...</i>

4
00:00:13,129 --> 00:00:14,642
<i>...and some guy.</i>

5
00:00:15,329 --> 00:00:18,719
<i>The tuxedo is a wedding safety
device, created by women...</i>

6
00:00:18,889 --> 00:00:20,880
<i>...because they know that men
are undependable.</i>

7
00:00:21,169 --> 00:00:22,727
<i>So in case the groom chickens out...</i>

8
00:00:22,889 --> 00:00:25,961
<i>...everybody takes one step over,
and she marries the next guy.</i>

9
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:29,162
<i>That's why the wedding vow isn't,
"Do you take Bill Simpson?"</i>

10
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:31,285
<i>It's, "Do you take this man?"</i>

11
00:00:37,129 --> 00:00:39,006
<i>Leave a message.
I'l cal you back. Thanks.</i>

12
00:00:39,209 --> 00:00:42,599
<i>Jerry? Joe Davola.</i>

13
00:00:45,369 --> 00:00:47,837
<i>I have a hair on my tongue.</i>

14
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:49,283
<i>Can't get it off.</i>

15
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:51,360
<i>You know how much I hate that?</i>

16
00:00:51,609 --> 00:00:54,601
<i>Of course you do.
You put it there.</i>

17
00:00:54,769 --> 00:00:56,646
<i>I know what you said about me,
Seinfeld.</i>

18
00:00:56,809 --> 00:00:59,721
<i>I know you bad-mouthed me
to the execs at NBC.</i>

19
00:00:59,889 --> 00:01:02,323
<i>Put the kibosh on my deal.</i>

20
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:05,322
<i>Now I'm gonna put the kibosh on you.</i>

21
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:07,680
<i>You know I've kiboshed before.</i>

22
00:01:08,329 --> 00:01:11,162
<i>And I wil kibosh again.</i>

23
00:01:17,449 --> 00:01:19,440
- So, what do you think?
- About what?

24
00:01:19,649 --> 00:01:21,526
<i>- About the opera.
- I don't wanna go.</i>

25
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:23,884
<i>- You gotta go.
- I don't like the opera.</i>

26
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:26,722
<i>What are they singing for?
Who sings?</i>

27
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:29,483
<i>You got something to say, say it.</i>

28
00:01:30,129 --> 00:01:32,484
<i>You don't understand.
That's the way they talk in Italy.</i>

29
00:01:32,649 --> 00:01:34,640
<i>They sing to one another.</i>

30
00:01:40,889 --> 00:01:42,083
All right. All right.

31
00:01:42,249 --> 00:01:44,240
<i>That's the way they was.
You listen to the language.</i>

32
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:46,525
It's got that sing-songy quality to it.

33
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:48,884
<i>It's the language, Jerry.
The language.</i>

34
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:52,799
<i>- So why don't they talk like that now?
- It's too hard to keep up.</i>

35
00:01:52,969 --> 00:01:55,483
<i>You know, they got-
They were tired.</i>

36
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,677
<i>- Better get that.
- Yeah.</i>

37
00:01:57,849 --> 00:01:59,885
<i>- It's me.
- Come on up.</i>

38
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:02,199
- So?
- I don't know.

39
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:06,647
<i>Come on. It's opening night.
Black-tie, Pagliacci. The great clown.</i>

40
00:02:06,809 --> 00:02:09,846
<i>The great, sad, tragic clown,
like you.</i>

41
00:02:11,369 --> 00:02:13,405
<i>Well, that's very flattering.</i>

42
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:15,605
<i>How'd you get tickets?
They're impossible to get.</i>

43
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:17,760
<i>Well, I have many associates.</i>

44
00:02:18,969 --> 00:02:20,960
<i>I don't know.
Opera, it's not my kind of thing.</i>

45
00:02:21,169 --> 00:02:23,160
<i>Then I'm gonna call
the whole thing off.</i>

46
00:02:23,329 --> 00:02:25,843
<i>Wait a minute. What about
George, Susan and Elaine?</i>

47
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:27,965
<i>- Why do you need me?
- You're the nucleus...</i>

48
00:02:28,129 --> 00:02:31,360
<i>...the straw that stirs the drink.
You're the "magliana."</i>

49
00:02:31,649 --> 00:02:34,038
<i>I guess if I'm the magliana,
I should go.</i>

50
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:35,961
All right. All right.

51
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:37,357
<i>- Hi.
- Hey.</i>

52
00:02:37,529 --> 00:02:38,723
<i>You got the tickets, right?</i>

53
00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:42,404
<i>- No, I don't have them on me.
- What? That's why I came over here.</i>

54
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:44,605
<i>My friend's got them.
I'll pick them up tomorrow.</i>

55
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:48,728
<i>I was gonna surprise Joey with them.
You got an extra one, right?</i>

56
00:02:48,889 --> 00:02:50,288
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

57
00:02:50,449 --> 00:02:54,840
<i>So I finally get to meet
your pal Joey.</i>

58
00:02:55,369 --> 00:02:57,325
<i>- It's killing you, isn't it?
- Yeah.</i>

59
00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:00,481
<i>So Joey's a great lover of the opera.</i>

60
00:03:00,649 --> 00:03:02,560
<i>Listen...</i>

61
00:03:03,289 --> 00:03:04,642
<i>...I got news for you.</i>

62
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,561
<i>It's nice to be involved
with somebody...</i>

63
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:09,448
<i>...who's interested in something
other than Nick at Nite.</i>

64
00:03:11,369 --> 00:03:13,200
<i>You know, he's got a grip on reality.</i>

65
00:03:13,369 --> 00:03:16,566
<i>He's- He's happy. He's well-adjusted.</i>

66
00:03:25,929 --> 00:03:27,248
<i>Looking forward to meeting him.</i>

67
00:03:27,409 --> 00:03:28,967
I gotta go.

68
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:30,718
<i>Where? What's the rush?</i>

69
00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:32,880
<i>To surprise Joey.
I've never been to his place.</i>

70
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:35,847
<i>- I'm just gonna pop in.
- Good, men love that.</i>

71
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:39,728
<i>Hey.</i>

72
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:42,801
<i>You got a message, buddy.</i>

73
00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:44,402
<i>It could be from that blond.</i>

74
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:50,727
<i>Jerry? Joe Dav ola.</i>

75
00:03:52,809 --> 00:03:54,242
<i>I have a hair on my tongue.</i>

76
00:04:01,249 --> 00:04:03,638
<i>What am I gonna do?
He's gonna put the kibosh on me.</i>

77
00:04:03,809 --> 00:04:07,597
<i>- He's crazy, out of his mind!
- Steady, steady! Now, calm yourself!</i>

78
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:10,602
<i>He's supposed to be on medication.
He told me he was on medication.</i>

79
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:13,283
<i>- What happened to his medication?
- Quiet! Now let me think.</i>

80
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:16,283
<i>I'm gonna call the cops.
That's what I'm doing. The cops.</i>

81
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:18,400
<i>Why?! They're not gonna
do anything!</i>

82
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:20,321
<i>They're the cops.
They gotta do something.</i>

83
00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:23,287
<i>He'll put the kibosh on me. Do you
know what it is to be kiboshed?</i>

84
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:27,521
<i>- Kibosh.
- It's a terrible mistake.</i>

85
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:30,965
<i>He thinks I ruined some deal at NBC.
I don't know anything about it.</i>

86
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:34,326
<i>- Call and tell him that.
- That- That's what I'll do.</i>

87
00:04:34,489 --> 00:04:38,368
<i>I'll just call him and tell him.
That's all I'll do. Right.</i>

88
00:04:38,649 --> 00:04:42,005
<i>He's a human being.
I'll talk to him. He'll understand, right?</i>

89
00:04:42,169 --> 00:04:43,841
<i>Yeah.</i>

90
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:45,362
<i>Don't mention my name.</i>

91
00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:50,207
<i>Oh, I got the machine.</i>

92
00:04:50,369 --> 00:04:52,963
<i>- What's his message like?
- Nice.</i>

93
00:04:53,769 --> 00:04:55,566
<i>Hello, Joe. Listen,
this is Jerry Seinfeld.</i>

94
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:59,244
<i>I think there's been a huge, colossal
misunderstanding.</i>

95
00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:01,923
Big. Big.

96
00:05:02,089 --> 00:05:04,364
<i>If we could just talk,
we could straighten this out...</i>

97
00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:07,202
<i>...so cal me back. Bye.</i>

98
00:05:10,409 --> 00:05:11,842
<i>Joey?</i>

99
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,401
<i>Joey?</i>

100
00:05:32,329 --> 00:05:35,924
<i>Oh, God. It's you. You scared me.</i>

101
00:05:36,089 --> 00:05:38,683
<i>Good. Fear's our most
primal emotion.</i>

102
00:05:40,729 --> 00:05:42,367
<i>You left your door open.</i>

103
00:05:42,569 --> 00:05:45,037
<i>I know. I like to encourage intruders.</i>

104
00:05:49,929 --> 00:05:50,998
What is all this?

105
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:52,363
<i>Do you like it?</i>

106
00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:56,317
<i>My home is a shrine to you.</i>

107
00:05:57,049 --> 00:05:58,721
<i>Where did you get all these pictures?</i>

108
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:01,767
<i>I took them myself
with a telephoto lens.</i>

109
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,123
<i>Coming out of your office,
your apartment.</i>

110
00:06:05,409 --> 00:06:06,922
Shopping.

111
00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:08,602
<i>Showering.</i>

112
00:06:10,129 --> 00:06:12,563
<i>Showering?</i>

113
00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:14,401
<i>I develop them myself
in my darkroom.</i>

114
00:06:14,569 --> 00:06:16,639
<i>Would you-? Would you like to see?</i>

115
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:20,562
<i>In the darkroom?
Oh, no, thank you.</i>

116
00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:22,879
Not right now.

117
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,927
<i>I'm a day person.</i>

118
00:06:30,009 --> 00:06:32,159
<i>Are-? Are you all right?</i>

119
00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:34,161
Why?

120
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:37,801
<i>Well, I don't know.
You just don't...</i>

121
00:06:37,969 --> 00:06:40,722
<i>- ... seem yourself.
- Who am I?</i>

122
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:44,881
<i>- Who am I supposed to be?
- That's a good question.</i>

123
00:06:45,049 --> 00:06:48,439
<i>Good question. It's very existential.</i>

124
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:51,999
<i>Who are you? Who am I?
Well...</i>

125
00:06:52,609 --> 00:06:53,758
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

126
00:06:53,929 --> 00:06:56,568
<i>Oh, nothing. I just stopped by
to chat.</i>

127
00:06:56,729 --> 00:06:58,959
<i>You know, shoot the breeze.</i>

128
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:02,121
<i>Were you able to get those Pagliacci
opera tickets from your friend?</i>

129
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:03,961
<i>I'm really looking forward to it.</i>

130
00:07:06,369 --> 00:07:09,759
<i>No, he couldn't get them.
We're not going.</i>

131
00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:11,722
<i>Really?</i>

132
00:07:13,969 --> 00:07:17,166
<i>Oh, damn it.
I just remembered I gotta go.</i>

133
00:07:17,329 --> 00:07:21,766
<i>I left something on. The gas,
the lights, the water in the tub.</i>

134
00:07:21,929 --> 00:07:24,682
<i>Something is on somewhere,
so I'm just gonna get the-</i>

135
00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:29,607
<i>Do you know the story of Pagliacci,
Nedda?</i>

136
00:07:30,809 --> 00:07:32,322
<i>I'm Elaine.</i>

137
00:07:32,489 --> 00:07:35,322
<i>He's a clown whose wife
is unfaithful to him.</i>

138
00:07:36,969 --> 00:07:39,722
<i>Do you think I'm a clown, Nedda?</i>

139
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:44,323
<i>Do I think you're a clown?
No. Not if it's bad to be a clown.</i>

140
00:07:44,489 --> 00:07:48,323
<i>If it's bad to be a clown, then
you are definitely not a clown.</i>

141
00:07:48,489 --> 00:07:53,165
<i>But if it's good to be a clown, then I
would have to rethink the whole thing.</i>

142
00:07:53,929 --> 00:07:56,602
<i>You've betrayed me with another,
haven't you, Nedda?</i>

143
00:07:56,769 --> 00:07:58,805
<i>Who is he? I want you
to tell me who he is.</i>

144
00:07:58,969 --> 00:08:01,164
<i>I want his name. Tell me his name.</i>

145
00:08:01,329 --> 00:08:04,799
<i>Oh, like any man would
ever look at me. Come on.</i>

146
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:07,039
<i>I'm gonna get out of here.</i>

147
00:08:07,209 --> 00:08:09,120
<i>Pagliacci kills his wife.</i>

148
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:12,645
<i>See? Now that's terrible. That is-
That's not a nice thing to do at all.</i>

149
00:08:12,809 --> 00:08:16,279
<i>I would assume- I don't know how
this Pagliacci thing turns out.</i>

150
00:08:16,449 --> 00:08:20,237
<i>But I would assume that there was
big, big trouble for that clown.</i>

151
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:21,763
<i>You're not leaving.</i>

152
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:29,167
<i>But, officer, he threatened me.</i>

153
00:08:29,329 --> 00:08:30,887
<i>I don't understand.
That's not right.</i>

154
00:08:31,049 --> 00:08:34,246
<i>What if it was the president
of the U.S.? I bet you'd investigate.</i>

155
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:38,118
<i>So, what's the difference?
I'm a comedian of the United States.</i>

156
00:08:38,569 --> 00:08:41,208
<i>And I'll tell you, I'm under
just as much pressure.</i>

157
00:08:41,609 --> 00:08:44,760
<i>All right. Thanks anyway.
Okay, bye.</i>

158
00:08:47,849 --> 00:08:50,283
<i>- Who is it?
- It's George.</i>

159
00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:56,842
<i>- You're locking the door now?
- Yeah.</i>

160
00:09:06,729 --> 00:09:08,401
<i>Well, well. Look at you.</i>

161
00:09:09,969 --> 00:09:12,529
<i>It's a little skimpy there, isn't it?</i>

162
00:09:14,049 --> 00:09:16,199
<i>You know the last time
I wore this thing?</i>

163
00:09:16,369 --> 00:09:17,563
<i>Six years ago.</i>

164
00:09:17,729 --> 00:09:19,924
<i>When I made that toast
at Bobby Leighton's wedding.</i>

165
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:22,080
Oh, that was a bad toast.

166
00:09:22,249 --> 00:09:23,602
It wasn't that bad.

167
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:26,203
<i>I never heard anybody curse
in a toast.</i>

168
00:09:26,889 --> 00:09:28,800
<i>I was trying to loosen them up
a little bit.</i>

169
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:30,641
<i>There were old people there.</i>

170
00:09:30,809 --> 00:09:34,597
<i>All the relatives.
You were like a Redd Foxx record.</i>

171
00:09:35,369 --> 00:09:37,439
<i>At the end of the toast,
nobody even drank.</i>

172
00:09:37,609 --> 00:09:40,282
<i>They were just standing. They were
just frozen. People-</i>

173
00:09:41,329 --> 00:09:44,401
<i>That might have been
one of the worst all-time toasts.</i>

174
00:09:44,569 --> 00:09:47,686
<i>Still, her father didn't have
to throw me out like that.</i>

175
00:09:47,849 --> 00:09:50,158
<i>He could've asked me to leave.
He had me in a headlock.</i>

176
00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:52,882
Susan's not going tonight.

177
00:09:53,289 --> 00:09:54,847
<i>What do you mean, not going?
Why not?</i>

178
00:09:55,009 --> 00:09:57,125
<i>She had to pick up a friend
at the airport.</i>

179
00:09:57,289 --> 00:09:59,041
<i>It cost me $100, this ticket.</i>

180
00:09:59,209 --> 00:10:01,848
<i>- Why didn't she pay for hers?
- That's a very good question.</i>

181
00:10:02,449 --> 00:10:05,122
<i>She and I go to dinner,
she doesn't even reach for the check.</i>

182
00:10:05,289 --> 00:10:07,849
<i>All I'm asking for is a reach.
Is that so much to ask for?</i>

183
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:09,601
<i>It's nice to get a reach.</i>

184
00:10:12,969 --> 00:10:15,608
<i>- Who is it?
- It's me!</i>

185
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:19,124
<i>Why are you locking the door now?</i>

186
00:10:19,609 --> 00:10:20,962
<i>Because of Davola.
Get in here.</i>

187
00:10:21,129 --> 00:10:23,006
<i>What the-?</i>

188
00:10:24,849 --> 00:10:27,283
<i>- How come you're not dressed?
- I am dressed.</i>

189
00:10:27,449 --> 00:10:30,122
<i>- You're going like this?
- Yeah. I want you to hear something.</i>

190
00:10:30,289 --> 00:10:34,248
<i>- You said people dress up for opera.
- Well, people do. I don't.</i>

191
00:10:35,849 --> 00:10:38,204
<i>If you're going like that,
I'm not going like this.</i>

192
00:10:38,369 --> 00:10:41,679
<i>Wait a minute! Do you think
I'm comfortable here?</i>

193
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:44,159
<i>I can't change. I got no clothes here.</i>

194
00:10:44,329 --> 00:10:46,479
<i>You gotta go like that.
I can't go like this alone.</i>

195
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:49,402
<i>Why should I be uncomfortable
because my apartment is closer?</i>

196
00:10:49,569 --> 00:10:51,525
<i>That's not the issue. We're friends.</i>

197
00:10:51,689 --> 00:10:53,600
<i>If I gotta be uncomfortable,
you gotta too.</i>

198
00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:57,045
<i>All right. I'll wear this. It's bad enough
I gotta go to the opera...</i>

199
00:10:57,209 --> 00:10:59,882
<i>...I gotta sit next to Ozzie Nelson
over here.</i>

200
00:11:00,169 --> 00:11:02,729
Would you turn that down?
What is that crap?

201
00:11:02,889 --> 00:11:04,561
<i>It's Pagliacci.</i>

202
00:11:04,729 --> 00:11:06,162
<i>Oh, beautiful.</i>

203
00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:08,684
<i>We got a little problem here.
We got two extra tickets.</i>

204
00:11:08,849 --> 00:11:10,965
<i>- Why, what happened?
- Susan isn't going...</i>

205
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:14,883
<i>...and Elaine's friend isn't going.
- Fantastic. We'll scalp the tickets.</i>

206
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:17,517
<i>We can make maybe 500 a ticket.</i>

207
00:11:17,689 --> 00:11:19,042
<i>- Really?
- Oh, yeah.</i>

208
00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:21,643
<i>People are looking for tickets here?</i>

209
00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:26,646
<i>Are you kidding? Opening night,
Pavarotti in Pagliacci?</i>

210
00:11:26,809 --> 00:11:29,767
<i>- We're gonna clean up.
- Oh, man, I knew I'd love the opera.</i>

211
00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:33,126
<i>- Yeah, right.
- Come on, let's go get the tickets.</i>

212
00:11:33,289 --> 00:11:36,042
<i>Listen, I gotta wait for Elaine.
I'll meet you at the theatre.</i>

213
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:37,961
<i>- Yeah.
- All right. Isn't scalping illegal?</i>

214
00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:39,881
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

215
00:11:55,929 --> 00:11:59,763
<i>You sprayed him in the eyes
with Binaca?</i>

216
00:12:02,249 --> 00:12:04,604
<i>Cherry Binaca. It's new.</i>

217
00:12:04,929 --> 00:12:07,363
<i>See, I don't get that.
First they come out with regular.</i>

218
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:08,882
<i>A year later, they have cherry.</i>

219
00:12:09,049 --> 00:12:12,166
<i>They know we like cherry. Start with
cherry. Then come out with regular.</i>

220
00:12:12,609 --> 00:12:15,328
<i>It was like I didn't know him.
He was a different person.</i>

221
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:17,446
<i>You should hear the message
from my nut.</i>

222
00:12:18,129 --> 00:12:20,962
<i>Where's George and Kramer?
I wanna get inside already.</i>

223
00:12:21,129 --> 00:12:23,040
<i>I feel very vulnerable.</i>

224
00:12:23,929 --> 00:12:25,328
<i>What you doing?
That's my quarter.</i>

225
00:12:25,489 --> 00:12:28,561
<i>- No, it's not. It's mine.
- I was just flipping it. That's mine.</i>

226
00:12:28,729 --> 00:12:30,003
<i>No, I dropped it. It's mine.</i>

227
00:12:30,169 --> 00:12:33,366
<i>All right, you want it, take it,
but don't try and tell me it's yours.</i>

228
00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:34,882
<i>Well, it is mine.</i>

229
00:12:35,329 --> 00:12:36,967
<i>What, you think I care
about the money?</i>

230
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:38,721
Is that what you think? I'll show you.

231
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:40,481
<i>Look at this. Here's a dollar. Look.</i>

232
00:12:40,649 --> 00:12:42,128
<i>That's how much
I care about money.</i>

233
00:12:42,289 --> 00:12:45,486
<i>You think I care about money.
That's how much I care about money.</i>

234
00:12:45,689 --> 00:12:47,441
<i>- Why don't you get lost?
- Why don't you?</i>

235
00:12:47,609 --> 00:12:49,600
<i>- Because I was standing here.
- Oh, yeah?</i>

236
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,282
<i>Yeah.</i>

237
00:12:55,529 --> 00:12:58,407
<i>I kind of like this opera crowd.
I feel tough.</i>

238
00:13:00,969 --> 00:13:03,529
<i>Anybody else got a problem?</i>

239
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:08,641
<i>- Hey, clown.
- Clown.</i>

240
00:13:09,169 --> 00:13:10,966
<i>Make us laugh, clown.</i>

241
00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:13,518
<i>- Nice face, clown.
- Make me laugh, clown.</i>

242
00:13:20,929 --> 00:13:23,363
<i>I got two. I got two. Pagliacci.</i>

243
00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:26,043
<i>Who needs Pagliacci, huh?
Come on, the great tragic clown.</i>

244
00:13:26,209 --> 00:13:29,201
<i>Come on, check it out. He laughs,
he cries, he sings. Pagliacci.</i>

245
00:13:29,369 --> 00:13:31,644
<i>I got two beauties right here.
Check it out.</i>

246
00:13:31,809 --> 00:13:33,640
<i>- All right.
- Hey, hey, you selling?</i>

247
00:13:33,809 --> 00:13:35,288
<i>I'm selling.</i>

248
00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:38,839
<i>- Where are they?
- Orchestra, row G, dead centre. Primo.</i>

249
00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:41,284
<i>You think you died
and went to heaven.</i>

250
00:13:41,449 --> 00:13:42,598
<i>What do you want for them?</i>

251
00:13:42,769 --> 00:13:45,044
<i>I'll tell you what I'll do.
You look like a nice guy.</i>

252
00:13:45,289 --> 00:13:47,041
<i>A thousand dollars for the deuce.</i>

253
00:13:47,649 --> 00:13:49,844
<i>- Give you $500 for the pair.
- Yeah. It's a deal.</i>

254
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:52,443
<i>- No.
- What, no? Are you crazy?</i>

255
00:13:52,609 --> 00:13:55,760
<i>- Look, let me handle this.
- That's $500. That's a great deal.</i>

256
00:13:55,929 --> 00:13:57,760
<i>You're blowing it.
The guy's a pigeon.</i>

257
00:13:57,929 --> 00:14:01,888
<i>Oh, God, see, he's walking away.
What is wrong with you?</i>

258
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,846
That was a $300 profit.

259
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,601
<i>I know what I'm doing here, George.</i>

260
00:14:05,769 --> 00:14:08,727
<i>This is not a Metallica concert.
It's an opera, all right?</i>

261
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:11,198
<i>A little dignity. A little class.
Give me my ticket.</i>

262
00:14:11,369 --> 00:14:12,961
<i>I will stand over here and sell it.</i>

263
00:14:13,129 --> 00:14:15,245
<i>Thank you. Stand over there.
I'll stand over here.</i>

264
00:14:15,409 --> 00:14:17,365
<i>- I know where I'm standing.
- All right.</i>

265
00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:19,963
<i>- Get your Pagliaccis here!
- Pagliaccis right here, huh?</i>

266
00:14:20,369 --> 00:14:21,961
<i>Where are they already?</i>

267
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:24,245
<i>I guarantee you they don't
sell those tickets.</i>

268
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:27,686
<i>Hey, look. There's Bobby Leighton's
father-in-law. Mr. Reichman.</i>

269
00:14:27,849 --> 00:14:29,760
<i>George and I were just talking
about him.</i>

270
00:14:30,289 --> 00:14:31,927
<i>He threw George out of the wedding.</i>

271
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:34,484
<i>Oh, yeah, when George
made that bad toast.</i>

272
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:37,846
<i>- You remember the curse toast?
- Oh, yeah. The curse toast.</i>

273
00:14:38,049 --> 00:14:39,323
<i>Can you believe that message?</i>

274
00:14:39,489 --> 00:14:41,605
<i>I gotta spend my life looking
over my shoulder.</i>

275
00:14:41,769 --> 00:14:43,566
<i>Me too.</i>

276
00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:47,527
<i>Crazy Joe Davola.</i>

277
00:14:48,409 --> 00:14:50,877
<i>- How do you know his name?
- Why wouldn't I know his name?</i>

278
00:14:51,289 --> 00:14:53,849
<i>- I never told you his name.
- I never told you his name.</i>

279
00:14:54,649 --> 00:14:56,765
<i>- Who are we talking about here?
- Joe Davola.</i>

280
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:59,159
<i>Right, Joe Davola.</i>

281
00:14:59,849 --> 00:15:01,362
<i>How do you know his name?</i>

282
00:15:01,929 --> 00:15:06,081
<i>I've been out with him three times.
I should know the man's name.</i>

283
00:15:06,729 --> 00:15:09,527
<i>- Oh, my God! It's Joe Davola?
- He's stalking you?</i>

284
00:15:09,689 --> 00:15:11,759
<i>- Are you kidding me?
- You're dating the madman...</i>

285
00:15:11,929 --> 00:15:14,727
<i>- ... who's trying to kill me?
- Why didn't you tell me his name?</i>

286
00:15:14,889 --> 00:15:16,925
<i>Last night he accused me
of seeing someone else.</i>

287
00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:19,284
<i>- He said, "Tell me his name!"
- He said that?</i>

288
00:15:19,449 --> 00:15:21,440
<i>If he sees us, can you imagine
what he'll do?</i>

289
00:15:21,609 --> 00:15:23,918
<i>If he thinks I ruined his NBC deal
and stole his girl!</i>

290
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,887
<i>- That will be a kibosh for sure.
- What about me?</i>

291
00:15:27,049 --> 00:15:28,607
<i>Excuse me.</i>

292
00:15:29,209 --> 00:15:31,518
<i>Come on. This is Pavarotti.</i>

293
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:34,244
<i>Three hundred dollars.
That's a lot of money.</i>

294
00:15:34,409 --> 00:15:37,321
<i>Steven Holtzman did a production
in Tunis last year.</i>

295
00:15:37,489 --> 00:15:40,925
<i>From what I understand,
the Muslims really took to it.</i>

296
00:15:41,249 --> 00:15:44,958
<i>I'll tell you what. You seem like a
nice guy. Let's stop jerking around.</i>

297
00:15:45,409 --> 00:15:49,448
<i>Give me $250. I got people waiting
for me. I gotta get the hell out of here.</i>

298
00:15:49,729 --> 00:15:52,482
<i>Scalping. I told them
to put on extra security.</i>

299
00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:54,002
<i>Excuse me.</i>

300
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:56,889
<i>Pop, would you buzz off?
I got something cooking here.</i>

301
00:15:57,049 --> 00:15:59,165
<i>- Costanza?
- Mr. Reichman?</i>

302
00:15:59,329 --> 00:16:01,285
<i>Still a sewer-mouth.
Give me those tickets.</i>

303
00:16:01,449 --> 00:16:06,807
<i>Harold, don't. Harold, be careful
of your hair transplant!</i>

304
00:16:06,969 --> 00:16:09,358
<i>Anything is welcome.
I accept change.</i>

305
00:16:09,529 --> 00:16:12,248
<i>I don't have anything.
I gave it to that guy.</i>

306
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:16,319
You know, you could just say no.

307
00:16:16,489 --> 00:16:17,888
<i>You don't have to humiliate me.</i>

308
00:16:18,049 --> 00:16:21,280
<i>I may be dressed as a clown,
but I am a person.</i>

309
00:16:21,449 --> 00:16:23,838
<i>- The guy took-
- I don't need people like you...</i>

310
00:16:24,009 --> 00:16:25,522
<i>...looking down their noses at me.</i>

311
00:16:25,689 --> 00:16:29,523
<i>I am just a street performer
trying to make enough to get by.</i>

312
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:32,044
<i>Doctor. Is there a doctor anywhere?</i>

313
00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:33,688
<i>We need a doctor!</i>

314
00:16:33,849 --> 00:16:37,080
<i>What are you, showing off
for your girlfriend here, is that it?</i>

315
00:16:37,249 --> 00:16:41,128
<i>I'm not his girlfriend. We dated
for a while but things didn't work out.</i>

316
00:16:41,449 --> 00:16:44,247
<i>You people make me sick.</i>

317
00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:50,407
<i>That is one angry clown.</i>

318
00:16:50,569 --> 00:16:52,321
<i>The hardest part
about being a clown...</i>

319
00:16:52,489 --> 00:16:56,084
<i>...it seems to me, would be that you're
constantly referred to as a clown.</i>

320
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:58,558
"Who is that clown?
I'm not working with that clown.

321
00:16:58,729 --> 00:17:00,128
<i>Did you hire that clown?</i>

322
00:17:00,289 --> 00:17:01,608
<i>The guy's a clown."</i>

323
00:17:01,809 --> 00:17:03,606
<i>How do you even start into
being a clown?</i>

324
00:17:03,769 --> 00:17:05,441
<i>How do you know you
wanna be a clown?</i>

325
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:08,282
<i>I guess you just get to a point
where your pants look so bad...</i>

326
00:17:08,889 --> 00:17:10,766
<i>...it's actually easier
to become a clown...</i>

327
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:12,965
<i>...than having the proper alterations
done.</i>

328
00:17:13,289 --> 00:17:16,964
<i>If you think about it, a clown,
if there isn't a circus around them...</i>

329
00:17:17,129 --> 00:17:19,484
<i>...is really just a very annoying person.</i>

330
00:17:19,649 --> 00:17:22,880
<i>I mean, you're in the back seat
of this guy's Volkswagen-</i>

331
00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:26,200
<i>"What, you're picking somebody
else up? Oh, man."</i>

332
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:29,521
<i>I got one. Who needs one?
Pagliacci. Pagliacci.</i>

333
00:17:29,929 --> 00:17:32,079
<i>The tragic clown. Pagliacci...</i>

334
00:17:36,449 --> 00:17:38,121
What did you say?

335
00:17:39,089 --> 00:17:40,681
<i>What, are you a cop?</i>

336
00:17:41,649 --> 00:17:43,321
No. I'm a clown.

337
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:46,806
Man, you look familiar.

338
00:17:47,969 --> 00:17:49,368
<i>You ever been to the circus?</i>

339
00:17:50,009 --> 00:17:52,284
<i>- Well, when I was a kid.
- Did you like it?</i>

340
00:17:52,449 --> 00:17:54,804
<i>Well, it was fun.</i>

341
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,917
<i>Was kind of scared of the clowns.</i>

342
00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:01,564
<i>Are you still scared of clowns?</i>

343
00:18:02,809 --> 00:18:04,322
<i>Yeah.</i>

344
00:18:06,849 --> 00:18:08,168
<i>We're gonna miss the overture.</i>

345
00:18:08,329 --> 00:18:14,404
<i>Overture, curtains, lights
This is it, we'l hit the heights</i>

346
00:18:14,569 --> 00:18:20,485
<i>And, oh, what heights we'l hit
On with the show, this is it</i>

347
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:26,683
You know, it is so sad.

348
00:18:26,849 --> 00:18:29,761
<i>All your knowledge of high culture
comes from Bugs Bunny cartoons.</i>

349
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:34,807
<i>Oh, there's that clown again.
What does he want from me?</i>

350
00:18:35,089 --> 00:18:37,205
<i>Look, I'm serious.
I don't have the quarter.</i>

351
00:18:37,369 --> 00:18:39,837
<i>- That guy took it.
- I don't want any money.</i>

352
00:18:41,609 --> 00:18:43,600
<i>I smell cherry.</i>

353
00:18:45,929 --> 00:18:48,284
- It's Binaca.
- Binaca?

354
00:18:53,129 --> 00:18:54,323
Go! Go!

355
00:18:54,569 --> 00:18:57,845
<i>- All right, what did we say, 275?
- Two-fifty.</i>

356
00:18:58,449 --> 00:19:01,680
<i>- Two-fifty? Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.</i>

357
00:19:02,129 --> 00:19:04,404
<i>- All right. All right, 250.
- George!</i>

358
00:19:05,009 --> 00:19:06,886
<i>- Susan.
- I don't believe it.</i>

359
00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:09,040
I'm so glad I caught you.

360
00:19:09,369 --> 00:19:11,837
<i>What are you doing here?
You were going to the airport.</i>

361
00:19:12,009 --> 00:19:14,079
<i>Some plane problems.
They landed in Philadelphia.</i>

362
00:19:14,249 --> 00:19:16,968
<i>So what? They don't have another
plane? She couldn't take a bus?</i>

363
00:19:17,129 --> 00:19:19,438
<i>She's coming in tomorrow.
But I made it.</i>

364
00:19:19,609 --> 00:19:21,645
<i>Yeah. How about that? You made it.</i>

365
00:19:21,809 --> 00:19:24,960
<i>I'm so excited. Now we get to see
the opera together.</i>

366
00:19:25,129 --> 00:19:28,485
<i>We get to go to the opera-
Get out of here- Together.</i>

367
00:19:28,649 --> 00:19:31,038
- Who's that?
- That's, that's Harry Fong.

368
00:19:31,209 --> 00:19:33,723
<i>He's a very good friend of mine.
He's a big opera buff.</i>

369
00:19:33,889 --> 00:19:36,449
<i>Enjoy the show there, Harry!</i>

370
00:19:36,649 --> 00:19:39,447
<i>- Come on. Let's go.
- You know what?</i>

371
00:19:39,609 --> 00:19:41,998
<i>- Come on. You gotta let us in.
- Not without tickets.</i>

372
00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:43,966
<i>We have tickets. Just not with us.</i>

373
00:19:44,129 --> 00:19:46,882
<i>Well, that's a problem. Excuse me.</i>

374
00:19:47,489 --> 00:19:49,844
<i>You don't understand.
Someone's after us, a crazy clown.</i>

375
00:19:50,009 --> 00:19:52,807
<i>- He's trying to kill us!
- A crazy clown is after you?</i>

376
00:19:52,969 --> 00:19:55,278
Oh, that's rich.

377
00:19:55,449 --> 00:19:57,485
<i>Clear the way so people
with tickets can pass.</i>

378
00:19:57,649 --> 00:19:59,446
<i>- We're with him.
- Are you guys ready?</i>

379
00:19:59,609 --> 00:20:01,122
<i>- Yes. Yes.
- Have you seen George?</i>

380
00:20:01,289 --> 00:20:03,644
<i>- We thought he was with you.
- Come on. He's on his own.</i>

381
00:20:03,809 --> 00:20:05,208
<i>Here.</i>

382
00:20:06,489 --> 00:20:08,320
<i>Here I come.</i>

383
00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:12,524
<i>- These are great seats, huh?
- Yeah.</i>

384
00:20:13,329 --> 00:20:16,924
<i>Boy, some cast, huh?
Pavarotti, Eva Marton.</i>

385
00:20:17,089 --> 00:20:19,205
<i>Eva Marton. I've heard of her.</i>

386
00:20:19,369 --> 00:20:22,884
<i>- Who's she playing?
- She's playing Pagliacci's wife, Nedda.</i>

387
00:20:23,049 --> 00:20:25,358
<i>- Nedda?
- Yeah.</i>

388
00:20:25,569 --> 00:20:26,718
Oh, my God.

389
00:20:26,889 --> 00:20:30,120
<i>Excuse me. Excuse me.</i>

390
00:20:30,289 --> 00:20:31,517
<i>Excuse me.</i>

391
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:33,441
<i>Excuse me.</i>

392
00:20:43,489 --> 00:20:45,445
<i>Susan, what are you doing here?</i>

393
00:20:45,609 --> 00:20:47,645
<i>- My friend's flight couldn't make it.
- Hi.</i>

394
00:20:47,809 --> 00:20:50,448
<i>- Where's George?
- I got his ticket.</i>

395
00:20:50,609 --> 00:20:53,248
<i>He decided not to come.
He said he was uncomfortable.</i>

396
00:20:53,409 --> 00:20:54,762
<i>Uncomfortable?</i>

397
00:20:54,929 --> 00:20:56,726
<i>How do you think I feel?</i>

398
00:20:57,929 --> 00:21:01,239
<i>- How much did you pay for that ticket?
- One-seventy-five.</i>

399
00:21:03,689 --> 00:21:05,919
<i>Kramer, who did you sell
your ticket to?</i>

400
00:21:06,089 --> 00:21:08,967
<i>Some nut in a clown suit.</i>

401
00:21:15,809 --> 00:21:18,801
<i>I had some friends drag me
to an opera recently.</i>

402
00:21:18,969 --> 00:21:20,925
<i>They've all got those little
opera glasses.</i>

403
00:21:21,089 --> 00:21:24,798
<i>Do you really need binoculars?
How big do these people have to get...</i>

404
00:21:25,129 --> 00:21:26,278
<i>...before you can spot them?</i>

405
00:21:26,449 --> 00:21:31,477
<i>These opera kids, they're going
250, 280, 325.</i>

406
00:21:31,649 --> 00:21:33,605
<i>They're wearing
big white woolly vests.</i>

407
00:21:33,769 --> 00:21:37,364
<i>The women have the breastplates,
the bullet hats, the horns coming out.</i>

408
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:39,679
<i>You can't pick these people out,
forget opera.</i>

409
00:21:39,849 --> 00:21:44,479
<i>Think about optometry.
Maybe that's more your thing.</i>
