1
00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:05,958
My parents had two arguments
while driving...

2
00:00:06,129 --> 00:00:08,689
...over either how fast
my father was going...

3
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:10,840
...or how much gas
was left in the tank.

4
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:13,842
My father had a standard defence
for either one of these.

5
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:18,287
It was always, "That's because
you're looking at it from an angle.

6
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:22,727
If you were over here-
It looks from where you're sitting...

7
00:00:22,889 --> 00:00:26,086
...it looks like
I'm doing 90 on empty.

8
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:28,840
But that's because
you're over there.

9
00:00:29,209 --> 00:00:32,963
If you were over here, you'd know
I'm in the driveway with a full tank."

10
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:41,166
George and I went up to NBC and
told them the idea for the series.

11
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:43,968
- We're waiting to sign the contract.
- They liked the idea?

12
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:46,438
- Yeah.
- What, you got leather seats here?

13
00:00:46,609 --> 00:00:49,362
- Since when is George a writer?
- What writer? It's a sitcom.

14
00:00:49,529 --> 00:00:52,043
This is exciting. When are
you gonna sign the contract?

15
00:00:52,209 --> 00:00:53,562
Soon. There's a few problems.

16
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:55,640
I wanna tell you,
that meal was the worst.

17
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,607
What do you expect?
It's airline food.

18
00:00:57,769 --> 00:00:59,043
They give you that fish.

19
00:00:59,209 --> 00:01:00,722
How could you
eat fish on a plane?

20
00:01:00,889 --> 00:01:03,528
She puts up a stink every time
I have a piece of meat.

21
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:04,963
What kind of problems?

22
00:01:05,329 --> 00:01:07,718
Well, George doesn't think
$13,000 is enough money.

23
00:01:07,889 --> 00:01:09,242
What? He's not even working.

24
00:01:09,489 --> 00:01:12,367
George is right. Those people
will try to get away with murder.

25
00:01:12,529 --> 00:01:14,281
Believe me, they're all crooks.

26
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:17,327
- Jerry, I want you to sign that contract.
- We're gonna sign it.

27
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:20,049
George is out with the woman
from NBC right now.

28
00:01:20,929 --> 00:01:25,207
So I'm afraid we're gonna
have to pass.

29
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:29,281
- You're passing?
- Well, it's much too low.

30
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:33,006
Are you and Jerry
in agreement on this?

31
00:01:33,289 --> 00:01:36,599
Yeah, we've talked. I believe I can
speak for the both of us on this.

32
00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:41,282
You know, because this is your
first show, it's a pretty standard deal.

33
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:44,358
- Standard?
- Yeah.

34
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:46,566
Is Ted Danson's deal standard?

35
00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:48,720
- Ted Danson?
- You know, the guy from Cheers.

36
00:01:48,889 --> 00:01:51,164
Yeah, I know who he is.

37
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:54,207
You're not Ted Danson.

38
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:57,159
I didn't say I was Ted Danson.

39
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:00,924
- All right, I'll tell Russell tomorrow.
- You tell Russell.

40
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:03,882
Oh, before I forget.

41
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:10,364
Cuban cigars.
It's a present from my father.

42
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:12,925
Do I have to write him
a note or something?

43
00:02:13,089 --> 00:02:15,762
- I'm sure he'd appreciate that.
- What would I say in it?

44
00:02:15,929 --> 00:02:18,204
You're a writer.
You'll think of something.

45
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:23,921
Oh, yeah. I'm a writer. I forgot.

46
00:02:25,009 --> 00:02:26,840
Were you waiting
long at the gate?

47
00:02:27,009 --> 00:02:29,159
I don't even know.

48
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:31,445
Where's that watch we bought you?

49
00:02:31,729 --> 00:02:33,082
Oh...

50
00:02:33,249 --> 00:02:35,319
That's it for this piece of junk.
I've had it.

51
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,923
- Is it the one your parents gave you?
- It never works.

52
00:02:38,089 --> 00:02:39,886
It's being fixed.

53
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:43,325
I got a guarantee on that watch.
Give it to me. I'll take it back.

54
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:45,320
- It's at the jeweller.
- Send me the bill.

55
00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:46,763
I'm not sending it.

56
00:02:46,929 --> 00:02:49,921
That watch was a gift.
You shouldn't have to pay for it.

57
00:02:50,089 --> 00:02:52,159
- That's $18.50.
- Here, I got it.

58
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:54,718
What are you talking about?
It's my car. Let me pay.

59
00:02:54,889 --> 00:02:56,242
- No, no, put it away.
- Dad.

60
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:58,400
- Stop it.
- I have money. I make money.

61
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:02,198
- Yeah, yeah, you make money.
- You don't think I make money.

62
00:03:02,369 --> 00:03:04,837
- I don't think that.
- Yes. That's what you both think.

63
00:03:05,009 --> 00:03:06,761
- I'm paying.
- Dad, I'm paying.

64
00:03:06,929 --> 00:03:08,203
- Get out.
- You're not paying.

65
00:03:08,369 --> 00:03:11,088
- Jerry, do not do this.
- No, no.

66
00:03:11,249 --> 00:03:13,717
Over my dead body, Jerry.
I'm telling you right now...

67
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:15,163
...you're not gonna do it.

68
00:03:19,729 --> 00:03:22,118
Boy, you got a lot of stuff here.

69
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:24,525
- Dad, what are you doing?
- Nothing, nothing.

70
00:03:24,689 --> 00:03:26,566
Leave it. What about your back?

71
00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:29,084
- Morty, what are you doing?
- All right, all right.

72
00:03:29,249 --> 00:03:31,080
You come here
to see a back specialist...

73
00:03:31,249 --> 00:03:33,638
...and you're lifting heavy suitcases.

74
00:03:33,809 --> 00:03:35,561
Hey, Morty.

75
00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:38,808
Hey, Mr. Kramer.

76
00:03:39,529 --> 00:03:42,123
- Hey, Mrs. Seinfeld.
- Kramer, hi.

77
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:44,043
What happened to you?

78
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:46,564
Oh, some guy kicked me
in the side of the head.

79
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:49,164
- What guy?
- Crazy Joe Davola.

80
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,479
- Why?
- Well, I was having this party...

81
00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:55,562
...and I didn't invite him,
and then Jerry tipped him off.

82
00:03:57,569 --> 00:04:00,766
Why did you tell this guy that
Kramer didn't invite him to his party?

83
00:04:00,929 --> 00:04:03,318
I didn't know he wasn't invited.

84
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:06,447
Hey, these are very
comfortable pants.

85
00:04:06,609 --> 00:04:08,804
You know what I paid for these,
Jerry?

86
00:04:08,969 --> 00:04:11,244
- So why did you say anything?
- It was a mistake.

87
00:04:11,409 --> 00:04:14,287
They're good around the house,
and they're good for outside.

88
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:17,484
- Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

89
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:19,685
I was little off last week, huh, Jerry?

90
00:04:19,849 --> 00:04:22,886
But the doctor says
it's just a slight concussion.

91
00:04:23,049 --> 00:04:24,846
What's the matter
with this Davola guy?

92
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:26,727
He's got, like, a chemical imbalance.

93
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:29,119
- He needs to be on medication.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

94
00:04:29,289 --> 00:04:31,245
He's after Jerry now.

95
00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:34,000
- Kramer.
- He's what?

96
00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:36,364
- He's joking.
- He's after you?

97
00:04:36,529 --> 00:04:37,803
- No.
- Why's he after you?

98
00:04:37,969 --> 00:04:39,368
He's not after me.

99
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:42,043
Morty, do you hear this?
Some crazy guy is after Jerry.

100
00:04:42,209 --> 00:04:44,769
- I'll make a few phone calls.
- Who you gonna call?

101
00:04:44,929 --> 00:04:46,203
What are you worried about?

102
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,200
I wanna know what
you did to this guy.

103
00:04:48,369 --> 00:04:50,758
- I didn't do anything.
- You must've done something.

104
00:04:50,929 --> 00:04:52,442
No, he just doesn't like me.

105
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:56,359
Doesn't like you?
How could anyone not like you?

106
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:59,323
- I know, it seems impossible.
- Doesn't-

107
00:04:59,489 --> 00:05:01,081
Doesn't like you?
How could that be?

108
00:05:01,249 --> 00:05:03,399
Ma, this may be hard
for you to understand...

109
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:06,641
...but I'm sure there are many people
who do not like me.

110
00:05:06,809 --> 00:05:09,198
Jerry, don't say that.

111
00:05:10,089 --> 00:05:11,727
- It's true.
- No, it isn't.

112
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:15,120
It's not true. You're a wonderful,
wonderful boy.

113
00:05:15,289 --> 00:05:17,849
Everybody likes you.
It's impossible not to like you.

114
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:19,283
Morty?

115
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:22,282
Maybe some people don't like him.
I can see that.

116
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:25,683
- Kramer?
- Yeah, I like him.

117
00:05:26,329 --> 00:05:28,684
Hey, Jerry, what time you got?

118
00:05:29,969 --> 00:05:32,119
I haven't got my watch on.
It's being fixed.

119
00:05:32,489 --> 00:05:34,241
When are you getting it back?

120
00:05:35,809 --> 00:05:38,164
- Next week.
- Next week?

121
00:05:38,329 --> 00:05:40,559
How come it's taking so long?

122
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,840
I said, how come it's taking so long?

123
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:48,524
I don't know. They're backed up.

124
00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:52,081
Wait a minute.
Where did you take it?

125
00:05:53,329 --> 00:05:55,081
- Where did I take it?
- Yeah.

126
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:59,243
Where did I take it?

127
00:06:00,769 --> 00:06:03,363
To that place on Columbus...

128
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,407
...and 85th, okay?

129
00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:08,525
What, Jimmy Sherman?

130
00:06:10,209 --> 00:06:11,483
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I know the guy.

131
00:06:11,649 --> 00:06:12,923
I take my stuff in there.

132
00:06:13,089 --> 00:06:15,205
I can get your watch back
by tomorrow morning.

133
00:06:15,369 --> 00:06:17,883
No, I don't want you
to say anything to him.

134
00:06:18,049 --> 00:06:20,040
I'd be happy to.
He's a friend of mine.

135
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:22,120
I'd like to follow
the regular procedures.

136
00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:24,280
I don't want any special treatment.

137
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:27,282
Hey, I'm gonna get that watch back
for you by tomorrow, buddy.

138
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:30,600
- Bring me the receipt.
- I'll get that too.

139
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:36,368
Be right back.

140
00:06:40,049 --> 00:06:43,166
Look, there's no watch. I threw it
in the garbage can on the street.

141
00:06:43,409 --> 00:06:45,798
My parents gave it to me,
but I didn't like it.

142
00:06:45,969 --> 00:06:48,005
So don't mention it again, okay?

143
00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:49,443
- Yeah, all right.
- All right.

144
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:50,883
Wait, wait-

145
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:53,002
Well, no-

146
00:06:55,809 --> 00:06:57,686
What was that about?

147
00:06:57,849 --> 00:06:59,362
Oh, no...

148
00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:02,197
...he's got my calamine lotion.

149
00:07:04,929 --> 00:07:07,807
I told him not to return it.
If he needs it, he should keep it.

150
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:11,803
He's got a thing on his ankle.

151
00:07:14,369 --> 00:07:16,883
How could anyone not like him?

152
00:07:24,689 --> 00:07:27,761
Hi. Morty Seinfeld.
I have a 2:00 appointment.

153
00:07:27,929 --> 00:07:30,921
Yes, Mr. Seinfeld.
Would you please fill this out?

154
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:33,728
All this? This whole thing?

155
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:35,686
It's gonna take me 45 minutes.

156
00:07:36,369 --> 00:07:38,758
I know, it's very long.

157
00:07:39,809 --> 00:07:42,687
Look at this. It's a book.

158
00:07:43,649 --> 00:07:46,561
"Employer's address."
Why do they need this?

159
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:48,328
I never had a back problem...

160
00:07:48,489 --> 00:07:51,287
...until that night I slept
on the convertible sofa.

161
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:54,600
- My back was fine.
- Oh, it's not the sofa.

162
00:07:54,769 --> 00:07:58,159
You stick up for that sofa
like I'm criticizing a person.

163
00:07:58,329 --> 00:08:00,365
We got it from Sullivan's.
It's a good store.

164
00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:04,841
Well, one day somebody's gonna
sleep on that thing, and we'll get sued.

165
00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:07,000
I hope this doctor
knows what he's doing.

166
00:08:07,649 --> 00:08:09,367
Leo says he's the best there is.

167
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:10,848
Leo.

168
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:12,920
I'm listening to Leo now.

169
00:08:13,089 --> 00:08:16,479
You're lucky he got you this.
You know what the waiting list is?

170
00:08:16,649 --> 00:08:19,402
Well, if he fixes my back,
I'll be happy.

171
00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:23,687
Have you ever had
a sexually transmitted disease?

172
00:08:23,849 --> 00:08:25,567
That's it.

173
00:08:26,609 --> 00:08:30,522
Here, you got my name, you
got my address. That's enough.

174
00:08:30,769 --> 00:08:33,966
Julie, you wanna take him back?

175
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:40,119
You what? You passed?

176
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:42,519
How could you do that?

177
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,645
Jerry, my young friend...

178
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:50,807
...you're so naive.
You are so, so naive.

179
00:08:50,969 --> 00:08:52,527
You know about a few things.

180
00:08:52,689 --> 00:08:54,122
You know about comedy...

181
00:08:54,289 --> 00:08:56,678
...a little bit about relationships,
some baseball...

182
00:08:56,849 --> 00:09:01,320
...but you're so far out of your element
here, you're embarrassing yourself.

183
00:09:01,489 --> 00:09:03,957
Now, listen to me. I'm negotiating.

184
00:09:04,129 --> 00:09:07,166
Negotiation.
This is what you do in business.

185
00:09:07,329 --> 00:09:09,763
Let me explain to you
what you just did.

186
00:09:09,929 --> 00:09:13,842
There are literally hundreds of people
trying to get pilot deals with them.

187
00:09:14,009 --> 00:09:19,129
They go with maybe five, okay?
If we pass, that's it.

188
00:09:19,289 --> 00:09:20,642
They go to the next show.

189
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:24,089
I'm scared.

190
00:09:24,329 --> 00:09:27,844
Oh, they're not gonna do the show.

191
00:09:28,489 --> 00:09:31,561
We're lucky they're even interested
in the idea in the first place.

192
00:09:31,729 --> 00:09:34,687
We got a show about nothing.

193
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:36,803
With no story.

194
00:09:36,969 --> 00:09:40,200
Do you think they're going, "Maybe
we should give those two guys...

195
00:09:40,369 --> 00:09:44,999
...who have no experience
and no idea, more money"?

196
00:09:45,969 --> 00:09:50,997
Oh, what are we gonna do?
I'm shaking. I'm shaking.

197
00:09:51,169 --> 00:09:52,921
- I think you're wrong.
- We'll just see.

198
00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:54,363
- Yes, we will.
- Yes, we will.

199
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:55,803
- I just said that.
- I know.

200
00:09:55,969 --> 00:09:57,243
- Good for you.
- Good for you.

201
00:09:57,409 --> 00:10:00,003
- You repeating everything?
- You repeating everything?

202
00:10:00,169 --> 00:10:02,524
- Well, George is an idiot.
- Well, George-

203
00:10:08,369 --> 00:10:09,643
All right.

204
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:12,482
All right. Let's go already!

205
00:10:14,969 --> 00:10:18,678
They keep you in here a year.
They don't give a damn.

206
00:10:18,849 --> 00:10:20,840
I could die in here.

207
00:10:22,849 --> 00:10:25,761
Excuse me. Excuse me!
What's going on?

208
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:28,318
I'm in here 20 minutes.
Can somebody please help me?

209
00:10:29,489 --> 00:10:32,765
- Quiet. Everyone can hear you.
- I've been waiting 20 minutes.

210
00:10:32,929 --> 00:10:34,521
Well, the doctor must be busy.

211
00:10:34,689 --> 00:10:37,601
Well, why do they make appointments
for if they can't keep them?

212
00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:41,758
Look, if I did that in my business,
I wouldn't have made a nickel.

213
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:45,727
Hello, Mr. Seinfeld.

214
00:10:46,009 --> 00:10:48,762
- I thought you forgot about me.
- We didn't forget.

215
00:10:49,809 --> 00:10:51,561
- What's wrong?
- The Velcro.

216
00:10:51,729 --> 00:10:54,880
I can't stand Velcro.
That tearing sound.

217
00:10:55,049 --> 00:10:58,405
I used to be in raincoats. I refused
to put that in any of my lines.

218
00:10:58,569 --> 00:11:02,448
Okay, Mr. Seinfeld, please come
this way. We need some x-rays.

219
00:11:03,569 --> 00:11:06,322
- Leave all my stuff here?
- Leave it.

220
00:11:09,289 --> 00:11:11,484
Oh, hey, by the way...

221
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:14,482
...do you want a box
of Cuban cigars?

222
00:11:15,129 --> 00:11:17,802
I smoked one last night.
I got nauseous.

223
00:11:18,409 --> 00:11:20,365
No, I don't want them.

224
00:11:21,449 --> 00:11:24,885
I'll take it. No, I'll take it. What is it?

225
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:27,042
- Here you go.
- What, cigars?

226
00:11:27,209 --> 00:11:28,483
- Yeah, Cubans.
- Oh, yeah?

227
00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:31,527
Yeah, the kind that Castro smoked.
You can't buy them anywhere.

228
00:11:31,689 --> 00:11:33,122
Castro, huh?

229
00:11:42,049 --> 00:11:43,960
- Yeah?
- Federal Express.

230
00:11:44,129 --> 00:11:47,007
Federal Express? Come on up.

231
00:11:47,169 --> 00:11:49,967
Federal Express?
I'm not expecting a package.

232
00:11:50,129 --> 00:11:53,007
You know what you just did?
You let a burglar in the building.

233
00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:56,438
- You think so?
- Federal Express? Of course.

234
00:11:56,609 --> 00:11:58,247
That's the oldest trick in the book.

235
00:11:58,409 --> 00:12:00,684
It might not be a burglar.
It could be a murderer.

236
00:12:01,329 --> 00:12:03,843
So you wanna just abolish
all home-package delivery?

237
00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:07,240
Yes, it's dangerous.

238
00:12:07,689 --> 00:12:09,168
Wait.

239
00:12:14,249 --> 00:12:16,365
- Who is it?
- Federal Express.

240
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:18,247
Okay.

241
00:12:28,329 --> 00:12:30,559
Hi, Kramer.

242
00:12:31,289 --> 00:12:33,439
Oh, God.
I thought you were in California.

243
00:12:33,609 --> 00:12:36,681
- Well, I came back for you.
- Oh, shut up.

244
00:12:36,849 --> 00:12:38,123
- I missed you.
- Really?

245
00:12:38,289 --> 00:12:40,325
- You really missed me?
- Yeah.

246
00:12:40,489 --> 00:12:41,808
Me too, miss. I miss.

247
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:44,529
Yeah, big missing
going on around here.

248
00:12:44,689 --> 00:12:46,247
Hey, I'm gonna get a match.

249
00:12:46,409 --> 00:12:48,161
Oh, God. Whose suitcase is this?

250
00:12:48,329 --> 00:12:50,889
My parents'. My father came up
to see a back specialist.

251
00:12:51,049 --> 00:12:54,519
Oh, God. It's probably
from sleeping on that sofa.

252
00:12:55,889 --> 00:12:57,561
- Boy, you look really great.
- Yeah.

253
00:12:57,729 --> 00:13:00,846
- You lie.
- No, no, you really look great.

254
00:13:01,009 --> 00:13:03,079
So tell us about the trip.
How's Dr. Reston?

255
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:04,841
Oh, he's fine.

256
00:13:05,009 --> 00:13:07,762
- Things are good?
- Yeah, you know.

257
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,563
- What?
- Did you see that?

258
00:13:11,729 --> 00:13:13,481
Yeah, I saw it.

259
00:13:15,569 --> 00:13:18,037
- What?
- It's a tell. You got a tell.

260
00:13:18,729 --> 00:13:20,287
What tell? What's a tell?

261
00:13:20,449 --> 00:13:23,486
When you ask about their relationship
and they touch their face...

262
00:13:23,649 --> 00:13:25,287
...you know it's not going too well.

263
00:13:25,449 --> 00:13:27,565
Go ahead. Ask me
how it's going with somebody.

264
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:32,525
- How's it going with Alice?
- Good, going good.

265
00:13:33,529 --> 00:13:37,488
The higher up on the face you go,
the worse the relationship is getting.

266
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:41,847
You know, it's like: Pretty good.
Not bad. I gotta get out.

267
00:13:45,329 --> 00:13:48,366
- How high did I go?
- You almost did the nose.

268
00:13:51,409 --> 00:13:56,199
Are you eating my peanut butter out
of the jar with your disgusting fingers?

269
00:13:56,929 --> 00:13:58,601
This is a sickening display.

270
00:13:58,929 --> 00:14:01,159
What, I'm not eating bread now.
I'm off bread.

271
00:14:01,329 --> 00:14:03,843
You're off bread.

272
00:14:04,049 --> 00:14:06,722
- So, what happened? Is it over?
- No, not quite.

273
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:09,608
- Why not?
- He was my psychiatrist, you know.

274
00:14:09,769 --> 00:14:11,964
I mean, he knows all my patterns.

275
00:14:12,129 --> 00:14:14,962
He knows in relationships
I always find some reason to leave.

276
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:17,643
So he says, as my doctor,
he can't allow me do this...

277
00:14:17,809 --> 00:14:20,448
...so he's not letting me leave.

278
00:14:21,729 --> 00:14:25,005
- What do you mean, not letting you?
- He has this power over me, okay?

279
00:14:25,169 --> 00:14:28,400
He has this way of manipulating
every little word that I say.

280
00:14:28,569 --> 00:14:31,163
He's like a Svenjolly.

281
00:14:32,609 --> 00:14:34,600
Svengali.

282
00:14:34,769 --> 00:14:37,283
- What did I say?
- Svenjolly.

283
00:14:38,289 --> 00:14:40,678
Svenjolly? I did not say, Svenjolly.

284
00:14:40,849 --> 00:14:42,680
- George?
- Svenjolly.

285
00:14:44,369 --> 00:14:46,758
I don't see how
I could've said, Svenjolly.

286
00:14:47,129 --> 00:14:50,326
Maybe he's got, like,
a cheerful mental hold on you.

287
00:14:52,689 --> 00:14:55,487
- I can't find a match anywhere.
- You know what you should do?

288
00:14:55,649 --> 00:14:58,686
Tell this guy you're seeing somebody
else. That's the easiest way.

289
00:14:58,849 --> 00:15:00,521
It's not gonna work with this guy.

290
00:15:00,689 --> 00:15:03,522
You just tell him an old boyfriend's
come back into your life.

291
00:15:03,689 --> 00:15:05,008
I don't think so.

292
00:15:05,329 --> 00:15:07,399
- Nice try.
- Took a shot.

293
00:15:07,689 --> 00:15:09,486
This is a good cigar.

294
00:15:22,449 --> 00:15:24,041
So when do I get to see the doctor?

295
00:15:24,209 --> 00:15:27,121
He'll be in with the x-rays
in a few minutes.

296
00:15:27,289 --> 00:15:29,166
You can get dressed.

297
00:15:37,209 --> 00:15:40,997
He stole my wallet.
The bum stole my wallet.

298
00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:45,484
My wallet's gone! My wallet's gone!

299
00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:48,245
I had my wallet in my back pocket.
It's gone.

300
00:15:48,409 --> 00:15:50,127
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

301
00:15:50,289 --> 00:15:53,565
I get my x-rays. Somebody takes
my wallet. Is that the operation?

302
00:15:53,729 --> 00:15:56,641
Mr. Seinfeld, I'm Dr. Dembrow.
I've been going over your x-rays.

303
00:15:56,809 --> 00:15:59,687
I'm not interested in the x-rays.
I want my money back.

304
00:15:59,849 --> 00:16:02,761
Somebody stole my wallet.
I had $225 in there.

305
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:05,318
- I don't see how that happened.
- Oh, you don't see.

306
00:16:05,489 --> 00:16:08,526
You don't see.
Well, it happened. Believe me.

307
00:16:08,689 --> 00:16:10,919
- What's going on?
- They stole my wallet.

308
00:16:11,089 --> 00:16:13,239
- What?
- Yeah, while I was in getting x-rayed.

309
00:16:13,409 --> 00:16:15,639
Mr. Seinfeld, I am sorry
about your wallet.

310
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,720
Would you like me
to look over the x-rays?

311
00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:20,961
- What kind of joint you running here?
- All right.

312
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:22,528
Fine.

313
00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:25,285
At least you could've
heard your diagnosis.

314
00:16:25,449 --> 00:16:28,043
I'm not interested in his diagnosis.
He's a bum.

315
00:16:28,209 --> 00:16:30,120
You came from Florida to see him.

316
00:16:30,449 --> 00:16:34,124
I wanna know what kind of office this
is where you can't leave your pants.

317
00:16:34,289 --> 00:16:36,041
You tell me.

318
00:16:38,969 --> 00:16:42,166
I'm sorry,
but there's somebody else.

319
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:48,882
Well, it's nothing I planned
on happening, you know.

320
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:51,165
It just kind of happened.

321
00:16:52,049 --> 00:16:55,246
- Tell me about him.
- Well, there's not really much to tell.

322
00:16:55,409 --> 00:16:57,969
You know, he's just a guy, really.

323
00:16:58,129 --> 00:17:01,565
- Yes, well, I assume he's a guy.
- Right.

324
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,799
And you've known him how long?

325
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:07,725
Years. Many years.

326
00:17:07,889 --> 00:17:12,041
We've been close friends, and then
recently, something just, you know...

327
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:13,927
...happened.

328
00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:17,807
- You mean sexually?
- Yeah, yeah.

329
00:17:18,489 --> 00:17:20,445
Sexually.

330
00:17:27,529 --> 00:17:28,962
I think your...

331
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:32,520
Excuse me. Yes?

332
00:17:32,809 --> 00:17:34,959
Oh, yes, Bobo.

333
00:17:35,129 --> 00:17:37,324
No, it's just east of Madison.

334
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:41,687
Around 4 will be fine.
All right, Bobo, see you then.

335
00:17:43,849 --> 00:17:46,079
I'm sorry. Where were we?

336
00:17:46,409 --> 00:17:50,448
Well, I was just telling you
about this other guy.

337
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:53,647
Elaine, do you remember
your dream...

338
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:56,607
...where you had a sexual
encounter with a Chinese woman?

339
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:02,406
Yeah, yeah.

340
00:18:03,369 --> 00:18:04,848
Elaine, I'm concerned about you.

341
00:18:05,129 --> 00:18:08,280
Oh, no. Don't concern yourself
with me, because I'm good.

342
00:18:08,449 --> 00:18:12,522
I'm very good. I mean,
I'm really very, very good.

343
00:18:12,689 --> 00:18:14,168
Elaine...

344
00:18:14,769 --> 00:18:16,760
...have you been urinating
a lot again?

345
00:18:22,729 --> 00:18:24,526
No.

346
00:18:24,689 --> 00:18:26,919
And how often
have you been seeing...

347
00:18:27,249 --> 00:18:29,285
I'm sorry. What is his name?

348
00:18:29,449 --> 00:18:31,804
- His name?
- Yes, his name.

349
00:18:31,969 --> 00:18:35,006
- Well, what's the difference?
- Are you afraid to tell me his name?

350
00:18:35,369 --> 00:18:38,042
No, I just don't really see
how that's relevant.

351
00:18:38,209 --> 00:18:41,440
It doesn't matter if you
don't see how. I see how.

352
00:18:42,089 --> 00:18:43,920
His name.

353
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:46,205
I don't even know.
You wanna know his name?

354
00:18:46,369 --> 00:18:48,758
I'll tell you his name. His name is...

355
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:50,521
...Kramer.

356
00:18:52,489 --> 00:18:53,888
Kramer.

357
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:56,005
Is that his first name
or his last name?

358
00:18:56,169 --> 00:19:00,128
You know, I'm really uncomfortable
talking about this.

359
00:19:00,289 --> 00:19:02,405
- Elaine, I want you to do me a favour.
- What?

360
00:19:02,729 --> 00:19:05,118
I want you to tell this young man
to give me a call.

361
00:19:05,289 --> 00:19:08,520
- It's very important that I speak to him.
- Oh, no, no, I can't do that.

362
00:19:09,129 --> 00:19:12,041
- You can do it, and you will do it.
- No, I can't.

363
00:19:12,329 --> 00:19:14,399
You can, and you will.

364
00:19:15,369 --> 00:19:18,839
Okay. Okay, yeah, I'll have Kramer
give you a call.

365
00:19:20,329 --> 00:19:22,320
So you didn't even let
the doctor treat you?

366
00:19:22,489 --> 00:19:24,798
I wouldn't give him the satisfaction.

367
00:19:24,969 --> 00:19:27,005
Why did you leave
your wallet in your pants?

368
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:30,127
What are you talking about?
What, was I supposed to hide it?

369
00:19:30,289 --> 00:19:32,041
- You could've taken it with you.
- Yeah.

370
00:19:32,209 --> 00:19:35,406
I'll be lying on an x-ray table
with my wallet in my mouth.

371
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:37,847
- Hello.
- Hello.

372
00:19:38,009 --> 00:19:39,408
Hi, Uncle Leo.

373
00:19:40,449 --> 00:19:42,917
I just spoke to Dr. Dembrow's son.

374
00:19:43,089 --> 00:19:45,284
He said they almost
had to call the police.

375
00:19:45,569 --> 00:19:49,118
What? I'm the one who should've
called the police. They stole my wallet.

376
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:52,201
You know how hard it was for me
to get that appointment for you?

377
00:19:52,369 --> 00:19:55,884
You can't just walk in on this guy.
He did me a personal favour.

378
00:19:56,049 --> 00:19:59,041
- All right, Leo.
- And you walked out without paying.

379
00:19:59,209 --> 00:20:01,769
How was I supposed to pay?
I didn't have my wallet.

380
00:20:01,929 --> 00:20:04,284
Well, I hope you send him a check.

381
00:20:04,449 --> 00:20:06,599
- What for?
- What for?

382
00:20:06,769 --> 00:20:08,680
This man was nice enough
to see you.

383
00:20:08,849 --> 00:20:11,044
He did me a personal favour.

384
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:14,758
That's the second time you said
personal favour. Why do you say that?

385
00:20:14,929 --> 00:20:17,159
- I said it once.
- Twice.

386
00:20:17,329 --> 00:20:18,921
And Dembrow
doesn't even know you.

387
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:22,240
His son happens
to live on your floor.

388
00:20:23,649 --> 00:20:27,403
Leo, where did you get that watch?

389
00:20:27,929 --> 00:20:29,681
You know where I got this?

390
00:20:30,409 --> 00:20:33,287
I found it in the garbage can.

391
00:20:33,689 --> 00:20:35,247
It kept terrible time.

392
00:20:35,409 --> 00:20:39,322
I brought it over to Jimmy Sherman
right here on 85th and Columbus.

393
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:42,765
Gave it to me back the next day,
works great.

394
00:20:42,929 --> 00:20:47,081
What kind of an idiot throws away
a perfectly good watch?

395
00:20:47,249 --> 00:20:49,604
Doesn't that watch look like
the one we gave Jerry?

396
00:20:50,129 --> 00:20:52,768
Hey, where's the waiter?
Dad, let's have some red meat.

397
00:20:52,929 --> 00:20:55,727
- Let's live a little.
- Let me see that.

398
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:58,927
Could we continue this
another time?

399
00:21:04,249 --> 00:21:06,365
Don't you hate
"to be continueds"on TV?

400
00:21:06,529 --> 00:21:09,646
It's horrible when you sense the
"to be continued"coming, you know.

401
00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:12,403
You're watching the show.
You're into the story.

402
00:21:12,569 --> 00:21:15,003
There's five minutes left,
and you realize:

403
00:21:15,169 --> 00:21:19,447
"Hey, they can't make it.
Timmy's still stuck in the cave.

404
00:21:19,609 --> 00:21:22,282
There's no way they wrap this up
in five minutes."

405
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:26,442
I mean, the whole reason you watch
a TV show is because it ends.

406
00:21:26,609 --> 00:21:31,285
If I wanted a long boring story
with no point to it, I have my life.

407
00:21:31,449 --> 00:21:35,761
A comedian can't do that, see? I can't
go, "A man walks into a bar with a pig.

408
00:21:35,929 --> 00:21:38,124
Can you come back next week?"
