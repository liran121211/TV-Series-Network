1
00:00:03,809 --> 00:00:05,925
Parents like to drag kids
to historical sights.

2
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:08,444
I remember going to
Colonial Williamsburg...

3
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:11,203
...and you see the supposedly
authentic blacksmith there.

4
00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:13,678
He's got the three-cornered hat,
knickers...

5
00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:15,168
...and the Def Leppard shirt.

6
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:19,448
My parents took me to the
Amish country, which to a kid...

7
00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:22,646
...to see a bunch of people that have
no cars, no TV, no phone...

8
00:00:22,809 --> 00:00:24,879
...they go, "So what? Neither do I."

9
00:00:25,049 --> 00:00:27,847
So it's the whole community
that's been grounded.

10
00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:29,965
That's the way they should
punish the kids.

11
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:32,165
"All right, get up to your room.
I've had it.

12
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:34,320
You are Amish, young man.

13
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:37,287
For the rest of this weekend.
Did you hear me? Amish.

14
00:00:37,449 --> 00:00:40,247
Don't come down till you make
some noodles and raise a barn."

15
00:00:45,729 --> 00:00:47,321
They have a guide. He takes you...

16
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:50,287
...shows you the battlefield,
gives you a bit of the history.

17
00:00:50,449 --> 00:00:52,167
How far is Gettysburg?
I'd like to go.

18
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:54,126
- About three hours.
- Tommy, you're on.

19
00:00:54,289 --> 00:00:56,359
- Gotta go.
- Have a good set.

20
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:02,328
What did they do for toilet paper
in the Civil War?

21
00:01:04,249 --> 00:01:07,002
Wonder what toilet paper
was like in the 1860s.

22
00:01:07,169 --> 00:01:10,047
Did they-? Did they carry it
in rolls in their duffel bags?

23
00:01:10,329 --> 00:01:13,002
Everything with you comes down
to toilet paper.

24
00:01:13,649 --> 00:01:15,048
- What?
- That's always...

25
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:18,042
...the first question with you.
Why is that always your focus?

26
00:01:18,889 --> 00:01:20,641
- Then what did they do?
- I don't know.

27
00:01:20,809 --> 00:01:23,482
Maybe they gave out big loose
clumps to all the soldiers.

28
00:01:24,449 --> 00:01:27,566
It would be nice if there was some
sort of historical record of it.

29
00:01:27,729 --> 00:01:31,085
They should have a toilet-paper
museum. Would you like that?

30
00:01:31,249 --> 00:01:34,366
So we could see all the toilet-paper
advancements through the ages.

31
00:01:34,609 --> 00:01:36,122
Toilet paper during the Crusades.

32
00:01:36,289 --> 00:01:39,042
The development of the perforation.
The first six-pack.

33
00:01:40,209 --> 00:01:41,767
Excuse me, Jerry.

34
00:01:41,929 --> 00:01:44,648
I'm Stu Schirmack. I'm from NBC.

35
00:01:44,809 --> 00:01:46,640
- Could we speak for a few moments?
- Sure.

36
00:01:46,809 --> 00:01:49,039
- Hi. Jay Crespi.
- Hello.

37
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:52,440
- C-R-E-S-P-I.
- That's right.

38
00:01:52,609 --> 00:01:54,486
I'm unbelievable
at spelling last names.

39
00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:56,480
- Give give me a last name.
- I'm not-

40
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:59,117
George.

41
00:01:59,609 --> 00:02:01,998
All right. All right.

42
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:04,846
First of all...

43
00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:06,688
...that was a terrific show.

44
00:02:06,849 --> 00:02:08,202
- Thank you very much.
- And-

45
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:11,327
I just wanted to let you know
that we've been discussing you...

46
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:15,482
...at some of our meetings, and we'd be
very interested in doing something.

47
00:02:15,649 --> 00:02:18,482
- Really?
- So if you had an idea for, like...

48
00:02:18,649 --> 00:02:22,483
...a TV show for yourself,
well, we'd just love to talk about it.

49
00:02:23,169 --> 00:02:24,841
I'd be very interested in that.

50
00:02:25,009 --> 00:02:26,522
Well, here.

51
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:30,284
Why don't you give us a call,
and maybe we can develop a series.

52
00:02:30,649 --> 00:02:32,287
Okay. Great. Thanks.

53
00:02:32,449 --> 00:02:34,360
- It was very nice meeting you.
- Thank you.

54
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:37,043
- Nice meeting you.
- Nice meeting you.

55
00:02:38,649 --> 00:02:41,561
- What was that all about?
- They said they were interested in me.

56
00:02:42,169 --> 00:02:44,399
- For what?
- You know, TV show.

57
00:02:45,409 --> 00:02:47,764
- Your own show?
- Yeah, I guess so.

58
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:50,917
They want you to do a TV show?

59
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:54,486
They want me to come up with an
idea. I mean, I don't have any ideas.

60
00:02:55,129 --> 00:02:59,008
Come on. How hard is that?
Look at all the junk that's on TV.

61
00:02:59,289 --> 00:03:01,007
You want an idea? Here's an idea.

62
00:03:01,169 --> 00:03:04,878
You coach a gymnastics team
in high school, and you're married.

63
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:08,883
Your son is not interested in
gymnastics, and you're pushing him.

64
00:03:09,169 --> 00:03:11,239
Why should I care if
my son's into gymnastics?

65
00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:14,924
- You're the teacher. It's only natural.
- But gymnastics is not for everybody.

66
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:17,768
- I know, but he's your son.
- So what?

67
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:21,762
All right, forget that idea.

68
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,439
It's not for you.

69
00:03:24,649 --> 00:03:26,162
Okay, okay. I got it.

70
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:28,604
You run an antique store.

71
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:31,203
- Yeah. And?
- And people come into the store...

72
00:03:31,369 --> 00:03:33,883
...and you get involved in their lives.

73
00:03:34,249 --> 00:03:37,559
What person who runs an antique
store gets involved in people's lives?

74
00:03:38,129 --> 00:03:39,960
- Why not?
- So someone comes in...

75
00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:44,407
...to buy an old lamp, and suddenly
I'm getting them out of a jam.

76
00:03:44,969 --> 00:03:46,561
I could see if I was a pharmacist.

77
00:03:46,729 --> 00:03:49,084
A pharmacist knows
what's wrong with everybody.

78
00:03:49,249 --> 00:03:50,887
Antiques are very popular right now.

79
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:53,199
- No, they're not. They used to be.
- Oh, sure.

80
00:03:53,369 --> 00:03:56,008
- Like you know.
- Oh, like you do.

81
00:03:58,809 --> 00:04:01,369
And you're the manager
of the circus.

82
00:04:01,529 --> 00:04:04,168
- The circus?
- Oh, come on. This is a great idea.

83
00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:07,127
Look at the characters. You got
all these freaks in the show.

84
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:08,642
A woman with a moustache.

85
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:11,483
Who wouldn't tune in to see
a woman with a moustache?

86
00:04:11,649 --> 00:04:16,040
You got the tallest man in the world.
A guy who's just a head.

87
00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:18,003
- I don't think so.
- Look...

88
00:04:18,169 --> 00:04:21,047
...the show isn't about the circus.
It's about watching freaks.

89
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:23,120
I don't think the network
would go for it.

90
00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:25,519
- Why not?
- I'm not pitching a show about freaks.

91
00:04:25,689 --> 00:04:28,726
Oh, come on, Jerry. You're wrong.
People, they wanna watch freaks.

92
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:30,527
This is a "can't miss."

93
00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:33,123
- Kramer.
- Hello, Newman.

94
00:04:34,249 --> 00:04:36,240
I got the helmet.
Go get the radar detector.

95
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:39,202
Okay. I'll be back in a second.
You guys coming to my party?

96
00:04:39,369 --> 00:04:41,246
- Yeah. Sure.
- Of course.

97
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,560
- What's this about?
- We're making a trade.

98
00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:47,960
I'm giving him my motorcycle helmet.
He's giving me his radar detector.

99
00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:51,724
- I didn't know you have a motorcycle.
- Well, my girlfriend had one.

100
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:53,527
You have a girlfriend?

101
00:04:53,689 --> 00:04:55,407
I had a girlfriend.

102
00:04:55,569 --> 00:04:57,241
And she was pretty wild.

103
00:04:58,569 --> 00:05:01,925
- I don't remember you with a girl.
- Nevertheless.

104
00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:05,560
This is a pretty bad deal for Kramer.

105
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:09,119
A radar detector's worth much more
than that helmet. You're cheating him.

106
00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:11,598
- Don't say anything.
- All right.

107
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:14,442
Hey, you know you're
getting gypped over here.

108
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:17,847
Really.

109
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:19,283
Hey. We had a deal.

110
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:21,758
Are you reneging out of the deal?
Are you reneging?

111
00:05:21,929 --> 00:05:23,840
- That's a renege.
- Stop saying "reneging."

112
00:05:24,049 --> 00:05:26,643
- Well, you're reneging.
- Okay, okay. I'm not reneging.

113
00:05:26,809 --> 00:05:28,367
All right. Give it to me.

114
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:30,281
- All right, let go.
- Come on.

115
00:05:31,569 --> 00:05:33,958
- Let go on three.
- Give me that. Just give me that!

116
00:05:34,129 --> 00:05:35,926
- Three.
- Here.

117
00:05:36,089 --> 00:05:38,159
Idiots.

118
00:05:39,009 --> 00:05:41,045
Thanks, buddy. So long.

119
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:45,244
- Does that thing work?
- No.

120
00:05:47,929 --> 00:05:49,328
I got a postcard from Elaine.

121
00:05:49,489 --> 00:05:51,207
- Really?
- Yeah. They're in London now.

122
00:05:51,369 --> 00:05:53,280
They'll be back in a few weeks.

123
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:56,168
I can't believe she got
involved with her shrink.

124
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:58,641
What about the TV show?
Got anything?

125
00:05:58,809 --> 00:06:00,686
No. Nothing.

126
00:06:00,929 --> 00:06:02,681
Why don't they have salsa
on the table?

127
00:06:03,609 --> 00:06:05,008
What do you need salsa for?

128
00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:08,087
Salsa is now the number-one
condiment in America.

129
00:06:08,249 --> 00:06:09,523
Do you know why?

130
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:11,327
Because people like to say "salsa."

131
00:06:13,369 --> 00:06:14,643
Do you have any salsa?

132
00:06:14,809 --> 00:06:17,403
We need more salsa.
Where is the salsa? No salsa?

133
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:20,723
You know, it must be impossible
for a Spanish person...

134
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:22,720
...to order seltzer and not get salsa.

135
00:06:24,089 --> 00:06:26,649
I wanted seltzer, not salsa.

136
00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:28,885
Don't you know the difference
between them?

137
00:06:29,049 --> 00:06:31,199
You have the seltzer after the salsa.

138
00:06:32,089 --> 00:06:34,808
This should be the show.
This is the show.

139
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:36,881
- What?
- This.

140
00:06:37,049 --> 00:06:38,641
Just talking.

141
00:06:38,809 --> 00:06:40,845
Yeah. Right.

142
00:06:42,809 --> 00:06:45,562
No, I'm really serious.
I think that's a good idea.

143
00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:47,799
Just talking?
Well, what's the show about?

144
00:06:48,369 --> 00:06:49,688
It's about nothing.

145
00:06:51,529 --> 00:06:53,884
- No story?
- No, forget the story.

146
00:06:54,049 --> 00:06:57,280
- You gotta have a story.
- Who says you gotta have a story?

147
00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:00,759
Remember when we were waiting for
that table in that Chinese restaurant?

148
00:07:00,929 --> 00:07:03,045
That could be a TV show.

149
00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:06,159
And who's on the show?
Who are the characters?

150
00:07:06,489 --> 00:07:07,808
I could be a character.

151
00:07:08,289 --> 00:07:10,849
- You?
- Yeah. You base a character on me.

152
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:13,842
So on the show there's a character
named George Costanza?

153
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:17,399
Yeah. What? There's something
wrong with that? I'm a character.

154
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:20,800
People are always saying to me,
"You know, you're quite a character."

155
00:07:21,849 --> 00:07:23,441
And who else is on the show?

156
00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:26,044
Elaine could be a character. Kramer.

157
00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:28,765
Now, he's a character.

158
00:07:28,929 --> 00:07:31,363
So everybody I know
is a character on the show.

159
00:07:31,529 --> 00:07:32,803
Right.

160
00:07:32,969 --> 00:07:35,164
- And it's about nothing.
- Absolutely nothing.

161
00:07:35,609 --> 00:07:37,839
So you're saying I go into NBC
and tell them...

162
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:40,079
...I got this idea
for a show about nothing.

163
00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:41,728
We go into NBC.

164
00:07:42,049 --> 00:07:44,085
We? Since when are you a writer?

165
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:47,242
What writer?
We're talking about a sitcom.

166
00:07:49,329 --> 00:07:50,648
You wanna go with me to NBC?

167
00:07:50,849 --> 00:07:52,362
We really got something here.

168
00:07:52,529 --> 00:07:53,803
- What do we got?
- An idea.

169
00:07:53,969 --> 00:07:55,800
- What idea?
- An idea for the show.

170
00:07:55,969 --> 00:07:59,484
- I still don't know what the idea is.
- It's about nothing.

171
00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:01,561
- Right.
- Everybody's doing something.

172
00:08:01,729 --> 00:08:03,606
We'll do nothing.

173
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:06,926
We go into NBC, tell them we got
an idea for a show about nothing.

174
00:08:07,089 --> 00:08:08,727
- Exactly.
- "What's your show about?"

175
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:10,800
- I say, "Nothing."
- There you go.

176
00:08:11,529 --> 00:08:13,167
I think you may have something here.

177
00:08:15,849 --> 00:08:17,760
So the show would be
about my real life...

178
00:08:17,929 --> 00:08:21,001
...and one of the characters
would be based on you.

179
00:08:21,689 --> 00:08:23,202
No, I don't think so.

180
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:25,200
What do you mean,
you don't you think so?

181
00:08:25,369 --> 00:08:27,087
- I don't like it.
- I don't understand.

182
00:08:27,249 --> 00:08:29,365
- What don't you like?
- I don't like the idea...

183
00:08:29,529 --> 00:08:32,168
- ... of a character based on me.
- Why not?

184
00:08:32,329 --> 00:08:34,479
I don't know. It just doesn't sit well.

185
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:37,039
There's gotta be a character
based on you.

186
00:08:37,209 --> 00:08:40,121
- That's your problem.
- I don't know what the big deal is.

187
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:41,927
You can do it on one condition.

188
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:44,045
- Whatever you want.
- I get to play Kramer.

189
00:08:44,209 --> 00:08:47,007
- You can't play Kramer.
- I am Kramer.

190
00:08:47,169 --> 00:08:48,443
But you can't act.

191
00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:54,484
- Okay, fine, we'll use Newman.
- Newman?

192
00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:57,641
- Use me for what?
- Nothing. What do you want?

193
00:08:57,849 --> 00:09:00,409
Well, you'll never guess
what happened to me today.

194
00:09:00,569 --> 00:09:03,800
I was driving home on
the Palisades Parkway...

195
00:09:05,849 --> 00:09:08,568
...when I look in the rearview mirror,
and what did I see?

196
00:09:08,729 --> 00:09:10,685
The fuzz. And it's funny...

197
00:09:10,849 --> 00:09:15,877
...because my new radar detector
was on, but I didn't hear a thing.

198
00:09:16,049 --> 00:09:18,847
- Isn't that strange?
- Yeah, that's strange.

199
00:09:19,009 --> 00:09:23,002
Because the radar detector,
as I understand it, detects radar!

200
00:09:23,169 --> 00:09:25,285
With a series of beeps
and flashing lights.

201
00:09:25,449 --> 00:09:27,485
But for some reason,
I didn't hear a thing...

202
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:29,560
...except for the sound
of a police siren.

203
00:09:29,849 --> 00:09:31,919
Well, that's queer, huh?

204
00:09:32,609 --> 00:09:33,883
I want my helmet back!

205
00:09:34,049 --> 00:09:36,438
You give me back my helmet,
and pay for that ticket!

206
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:39,442
Oh, yeah, yeah.
You better think again, MoJumbo.

207
00:09:41,449 --> 00:09:43,201
You gave me a defective detector.

208
00:09:43,369 --> 00:09:44,848
- Jerry?
- Buyer beware.

209
00:09:45,049 --> 00:09:46,528
Are you gonna give me my helmet?

210
00:09:46,689 --> 00:09:49,408
No, we had a deal.
There's no guarantees in life.

211
00:09:49,649 --> 00:09:51,162
No, but there's karma, Kramer.

212
00:09:51,329 --> 00:09:53,047
Karma Kramer?

213
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:55,243
And one more thing:

214
00:09:55,409 --> 00:09:57,286
I'm not coming to your party!

215
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:04,079
Salsa, seltzer.

216
00:10:04,889 --> 00:10:06,163
Do you have any salsa?

217
00:10:06,329 --> 00:10:08,559
No, not seltzer, salsa.

218
00:10:09,929 --> 00:10:12,727
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

219
00:10:13,169 --> 00:10:14,568
You sure?

220
00:10:14,729 --> 00:10:16,959
- You look a little pale.
- No, I'm fine. I'm good.

221
00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:18,721
Fine. Very good.

222
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:21,608
- What, are you nervous?
- No, I'm not nervous. I'm very good.

223
00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:25,199
- I can't do this. I can't do this.
- What?

224
00:10:25,369 --> 00:10:27,485
I can't. I've tried. I'm here.
It's impossible.

225
00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:29,844
- This was your idea.
- What idea?

226
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:33,240
I just said something. I didn't
know you were gonna listen to me!

227
00:10:33,569 --> 00:10:35,127
Don't worry about it.

228
00:10:35,449 --> 00:10:37,405
They're just TV executives.

229
00:10:37,569 --> 00:10:40,447
They're men with jobs, Jerry!

230
00:10:41,529 --> 00:10:43,440
They wear suits and ties.

231
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:46,646
They're married.
They have secretaries!

232
00:10:46,809 --> 00:10:48,800
- I told you not to come.
- I need some water.

233
00:10:48,969 --> 00:10:50,243
I gotta get some water.

234
00:10:50,409 --> 00:10:53,128
- They'll give us water in there.
- Really?

235
00:10:55,129 --> 00:10:56,960
That's pretty good.

236
00:11:01,049 --> 00:11:03,688
- Oh, God, it's Joe Davola.
- Who?

237
00:11:03,849 --> 00:11:05,646
This guy's a writer. He's a total nut.

238
00:11:05,809 --> 00:11:07,845
I think he goes to
the same shrink as Elaine.

239
00:11:09,889 --> 00:11:11,925
Oh, God, he saw me.

240
00:11:12,409 --> 00:11:15,606
- Hello, Jerry.
- Hey, Joe!

241
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:17,083
How you doing?

242
00:11:17,249 --> 00:11:19,717
You're under no obligation
to shake my hand.

243
00:11:20,809 --> 00:11:23,039
Oh, no. Just a custom.

244
00:11:23,209 --> 00:11:25,769
That's my friend, George.

245
00:11:26,169 --> 00:11:27,761
You look good.

246
00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:29,362
Why shouldn't I look good?

247
00:11:30,369 --> 00:11:32,644
No. No reason.
You do the karate, right?

248
00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:35,040
Yeah, you wanna hit me?

249
00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:37,769
- What are you doing here?
- I dropped a script off.

250
00:11:38,809 --> 00:11:40,128
Good for you.

251
00:11:47,209 --> 00:11:48,767
Well.

252
00:11:48,929 --> 00:11:51,602
- You don't have to say anything.
- No...

253
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:54,647
- Hey, I guess I'll see you Sunday night.
- Why?

254
00:11:54,809 --> 00:11:56,561
Kramer's party.

255
00:11:56,729 --> 00:12:01,280
- Kramer's having a party?
- No. No, he's not having a party.

256
00:12:01,609 --> 00:12:05,158
He's doing something. I don't know.
It's nothing. He's not doing anything.

257
00:12:05,849 --> 00:12:07,965
I thought Kramer and I
were very close friends.

258
00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:11,405
No, I'm sure you are.
I'm sure you're very close friends.

259
00:12:11,569 --> 00:12:13,400
Very close.

260
00:12:14,289 --> 00:12:16,280
Give my best to Hinckley.

261
00:12:21,769 --> 00:12:23,760
- What was that?
- I can't believe what I did.

262
00:12:23,929 --> 00:12:26,648
I didn't know Kramer didn't invite him.
I gotta call Kramer.

263
00:12:27,009 --> 00:12:28,408
They're ready for you.

264
00:12:28,569 --> 00:12:30,605
Okay. Okay. Look.

265
00:12:30,769 --> 00:12:32,964
- You- You do all the talking. Okay?
- Oh, relax!

266
00:12:33,129 --> 00:12:35,689
- Who are they?
- Yeah.

267
00:12:35,849 --> 00:12:37,840
- They're not better than me.
- Of course not.

268
00:12:38,009 --> 00:12:39,488
- Who are they?
- They're nobody.

269
00:12:39,649 --> 00:12:41,128
- What about me?
- What about you?

270
00:12:41,289 --> 00:12:43,245
- Why them? Why not me?
- Why not you?

271
00:12:43,409 --> 00:12:45,240
- I'm just as good as them.
- Better.

272
00:12:45,409 --> 00:12:47,479
- You really think so?
- No.

273
00:13:03,609 --> 00:13:07,761
The bit- The bit I really liked was
where the parakeet flew into the mirror.

274
00:13:07,929 --> 00:13:09,647
That was funny.

275
00:13:12,289 --> 00:13:14,723
The parakeet in the mirror.
That is a good one, Stu.

276
00:13:14,889 --> 00:13:17,357
Yeah. One of my favourites.

277
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:23,485
What about you, George? Have you
written anything we might know?

278
00:13:26,369 --> 00:13:28,724
Well, possibly. I...

279
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:32,445
I wrote an off-Broadway show.

280
00:13:32,609 --> 00:13:34,565
La Cocina.

281
00:13:34,729 --> 00:13:36,879
Actually, it was off-off Broadway.

282
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:42,123
It was a comedy
about a Mexican chef.

283
00:13:43,249 --> 00:13:44,967
It was- It was very funny.

284
00:13:45,129 --> 00:13:48,326
There was one great scene
with the chef.

285
00:13:48,489 --> 00:13:50,559
What was his name?

286
00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:53,198
- Pepe.
- Oh, Pepe. Yes, Pepe.

287
00:13:53,369 --> 00:13:55,166
And he was making tamales.

288
00:13:55,329 --> 00:13:57,160
Oh, he actually cooked on the stage?

289
00:13:57,529 --> 00:14:01,317
No, no, he mimed it.
That's what was so funny about it.

290
00:14:02,849 --> 00:14:04,999
So, what have you two
come up with?

291
00:14:05,169 --> 00:14:07,205
We thought about this
in a variety of ways...

292
00:14:07,369 --> 00:14:11,123
- ... but the basic idea is I play myself-
- May I?

293
00:14:11,689 --> 00:14:13,327
Go ahead.

294
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:17,842
I think I can sum up the show
for you with one word:

295
00:14:18,809 --> 00:14:20,527
Nothing.

296
00:14:21,369 --> 00:14:23,405
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

297
00:14:23,689 --> 00:14:25,008
What does that mean?

298
00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:29,004
The show is about nothing.

299
00:14:30,809 --> 00:14:33,039
- It's not about nothing.
- No, it's about nothing.

300
00:14:33,209 --> 00:14:35,279
Well, maybe in philosophy.

301
00:14:35,449 --> 00:14:36,848
But even nothing is something.

302
00:14:37,129 --> 00:14:39,165
Mr. Dalrymple, your niece
is on the phone.

303
00:14:39,329 --> 00:14:43,402
- I'll call back.
- D-A-L-R-I-M-P-E-L.

304
00:14:43,569 --> 00:14:45,366
Not even close.

305
00:14:46,169 --> 00:14:48,524
- Is that with a Y?
- No.

306
00:14:51,329 --> 00:14:54,241
- What's the premise?
- As I was saying, I would play myself...

307
00:14:54,409 --> 00:14:56,604
...as a comedian
living in New York...

308
00:14:56,769 --> 00:14:59,488
...and I have a friend and a neighbour
and an ex-girlfriend.

309
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:02,368
- Which is all true.
- But nothing happens on the show.

310
00:15:02,529 --> 00:15:03,962
You see, it's just like life.

311
00:15:04,129 --> 00:15:08,122
You know, you eat, you go
shopping, you read, you eat...

312
00:15:08,289 --> 00:15:11,406
- ... you read, you go shopping.
- You read?

313
00:15:11,569 --> 00:15:13,639
You read on the show?

314
00:15:13,809 --> 00:15:17,518
Well, I don't know about the reading.
We didn't discuss the reading.

315
00:15:19,409 --> 00:15:21,127
All right, tell me about the stories.

316
00:15:21,289 --> 00:15:23,200
- What kind of stories?
- Oh, no. No stories.

317
00:15:23,369 --> 00:15:24,882
No stories?

318
00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:27,325
- So, what is it?
- What did you do today?

319
00:15:28,409 --> 00:15:31,685
- I got up and came to work.
- There's a show. That's a show.

320
00:15:32,489 --> 00:15:33,922
How is that a show?

321
00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:36,649
Well, maybe something happens
to you on the way to work.

322
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:39,767
No. No! No! Nothing happens!

323
00:15:39,929 --> 00:15:41,806
Well, something happens.

324
00:15:41,969 --> 00:15:44,927
- Well, why am I watching it?
- Because it's on TV.

325
00:15:45,969 --> 00:15:47,243
Not yet.

326
00:15:51,169 --> 00:15:53,399
Okay, look.

327
00:15:53,569 --> 00:15:56,402
If you wanna just keep doing
the same old thing...

328
00:15:56,569 --> 00:15:59,925
...then maybe this idea is not for you.

329
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:04,805
I, for one, am not going to
compromise my artistic integrity.

330
00:16:04,969 --> 00:16:07,039
And I'll tell you something else:

331
00:16:07,249 --> 00:16:10,321
This is the show,
and we're not gonna change it.

332
00:16:11,449 --> 00:16:13,121
Right?

333
00:16:16,289 --> 00:16:17,927
How about this?

334
00:16:18,089 --> 00:16:20,125
I manage a circus.

335
00:16:26,289 --> 00:16:28,439
I don't even wanna talk
about it anymore.

336
00:16:29,609 --> 00:16:31,281
What were you thinking?

337
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:32,928
What was going on in your mind?

338
00:16:33,489 --> 00:16:35,161
Artistic integrity.

339
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:37,160
Well, where did you
come up with that?

340
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:40,241
You're not artistic,
and you have no integrity.

341
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:44,559
You really need some help. A regular
psychiatrist couldn't even help you.

342
00:16:44,729 --> 00:16:46,765
You need to go to, like,
Vienna or something.

343
00:16:46,969 --> 00:16:50,200
You know what I mean? You need
to get involved at the university level.

344
00:16:50,369 --> 00:16:52,758
Like where Freud studied,
and have people looking...

345
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:55,318
...and checking up on you.
That's the kind you need.

346
00:16:55,489 --> 00:16:58,720
Not the once-a-week for 80 bucks.
No. You need a team.

347
00:16:59,449 --> 00:17:02,202
A team of psychiatrists,
working round the clock...

348
00:17:02,369 --> 00:17:04,405
...thinking about you,
having conferences.

349
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:07,766
Observing you, like the way
they did with the Elephant Man.

350
00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:11,478
That's what I'm talking about. That's
the only way you're gonna get better.

351
00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:17,648
I thought the woman
was kind of cute.

352
00:17:18,529 --> 00:17:21,282
Hold it. I really wanna
be clear about this.

353
00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:24,043
Are you talking about
the woman in the meeting?

354
00:17:24,489 --> 00:17:26,320
Is that the woman
you're talking about?

355
00:17:26,489 --> 00:17:28,798
Yeah. I thought I might
give her a call.

356
00:17:30,329 --> 00:17:33,480
I don't meet that many women.
I meet, like, three women a year.

357
00:17:33,649 --> 00:17:36,038
I mean, we've been introduced.
She knows my name.

358
00:17:36,249 --> 00:17:38,717
- It's completely inappropriate.
- Why?

359
00:17:38,929 --> 00:17:41,807
Maybe she liked me. I mean, she-
She was looking right at me.

360
00:17:42,489 --> 00:17:43,922
I think she was impressed.

361
00:17:44,089 --> 00:17:47,081
We had good eye contact
through the whole meeting.

362
00:17:47,689 --> 00:17:51,568
- Oh, I forgot to call Kramer.
- Wait a minute, let me call Susan.

363
00:17:51,729 --> 00:17:54,562
- No, this is more important.
- She might leave work any minute.

364
00:17:54,729 --> 00:17:57,289
I gotta warn him that I told
Joe Davola about his party.

365
00:17:57,449 --> 00:17:58,882
No!

366
00:18:05,769 --> 00:18:07,521
What is it?

367
00:18:07,889 --> 00:18:10,847
I was just thinking about
this patient of mine.

368
00:18:11,129 --> 00:18:12,403
What?

369
00:18:12,569 --> 00:18:15,447
Just wondering if he's taking
his medication.

370
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:19,319
Come on. We're on vacation.

371
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:25,678
Well, we were standing
in the waiting area there...

372
00:18:25,849 --> 00:18:28,044
...and you know how Davola is.
He's all...

373
00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:32,598
- Yeah?
- It's George.

374
00:18:33,409 --> 00:18:36,048
And so I felt very
uncomfortable with him...

375
00:18:36,209 --> 00:18:39,121
...and, you know, I just blurted out
something about your party.

376
00:18:39,969 --> 00:18:42,722
- Back up a second.
- I didn't know you didn't invite him.

377
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:44,163
Why would I invite him?

378
00:18:44,329 --> 00:18:46,047
- Well, I just assumed that-
- Assumed?

379
00:18:46,289 --> 00:18:49,087
Never assume anything.
I don't want that nut in my house.

380
00:18:49,249 --> 00:18:50,762
You know he's on medication.

381
00:18:51,329 --> 00:18:54,446
- Well, hello. Oh, hello.
- Hello.

382
00:18:54,609 --> 00:18:57,203
You remember Susan from NBC.

383
00:18:57,369 --> 00:19:00,361
- Of course. How are you?
- Fine. Good to see you.

384
00:19:00,529 --> 00:19:03,202
- This is Kramer.
- Hello.

385
00:19:04,089 --> 00:19:05,886
All right, go ahead, Susan. Tell him.

386
00:19:06,049 --> 00:19:08,005
- Tell me what?
- Well, I-

387
00:19:08,209 --> 00:19:09,688
I'm sorry. Excuse me one second.

388
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:11,123
- Hello?
- Hi...

389
00:19:11,289 --> 00:19:14,087
...would you be interested
in switching to TMI long distance?

390
00:19:14,249 --> 00:19:15,523
I- I can't talk right now.

391
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:18,487
Why don't you give me your home
number, and I'll call later?

392
00:19:18,649 --> 00:19:20,446
I'm sorry. We're not alowed
to do that.

393
00:19:20,689 --> 00:19:22,964
I guess you don't want
people calling you at home.

394
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:25,882
- No.
- Well, now you know how I feel.

395
00:19:31,489 --> 00:19:33,764
- So go ahead. Tell him.
- Well-

396
00:19:34,249 --> 00:19:35,921
Kramer, are you drinking that milk?

397
00:19:36,889 --> 00:19:39,722
- Yeah.
- What's the expiration date on that?

398
00:19:41,009 --> 00:19:42,965
September third.

399
00:19:43,129 --> 00:19:45,245
- The third?
- The third?

400
00:19:57,249 --> 00:19:59,763
Never should have
brought her up there.

401
00:20:00,129 --> 00:20:02,006
Should have known better.

402
00:20:02,169 --> 00:20:04,558
I should have seen it coming.
I didn't see it coming.

403
00:20:05,689 --> 00:20:08,249
I think she saw it coming.

404
00:20:09,929 --> 00:20:13,001
You know, she was behind the idea.
She was gonna champion the show.

405
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:15,558
I was bringing her up to tell you,
and she liked me.

406
00:20:15,929 --> 00:20:20,366
Look, just because Kramer vomited
on her doesn't mean the deal is dead.

407
00:20:21,169 --> 00:20:22,488
What are you, crazy?

408
00:20:22,649 --> 00:20:25,117
It's a traumatic thing
to be thrown up on.

409
00:20:25,409 --> 00:20:27,525
Vomiting is not a deal-breaker.

410
00:20:27,689 --> 00:20:29,645
If Hitler had vomited on Chamberlain...

411
00:20:29,809 --> 00:20:32,004
...he still would have
given him Czechoslovakia.

412
00:20:32,169 --> 00:20:33,443
Chamberlain.

413
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:37,443
You could hold his head in the toilet,
he'd still give you half of Europe.

414
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:40,808
What happened to you?

415
00:20:41,489 --> 00:20:42,763
Davola came after me.

416
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:44,688
What? Davola?

417
00:20:44,849 --> 00:20:47,568
See, this guy is crazy.
I can't believe this. What happened?

418
00:20:47,729 --> 00:20:50,323
Can I get coffee? You know,
I was walking home...

419
00:20:50,529 --> 00:20:53,760
I had to pick up my helmet from
the shop. I had to get a new strap.

420
00:20:53,929 --> 00:20:57,126
So I had it on, and I was checking
the strap out to make sure it fit.

421
00:20:57,329 --> 00:21:00,958
And suddenly, I feel this kick
hit me on the side of the head.

422
00:21:01,209 --> 00:21:05,521
It knocks me down. I look up,
and it's Crazy Joe Davola.

423
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:08,568
And he says, "That's what I think
of your party."

424
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:12,605
- Boy, that is some kick.
- Newman's helmet, it saved my life.

425
00:21:12,769 --> 00:21:15,203
- Look at that.
- Wow, Newman's helmet.

426
00:21:16,329 --> 00:21:17,887
I got bad news for you, buddy.

427
00:21:18,049 --> 00:21:19,482
Davola says you're next.

428
00:21:19,969 --> 00:21:21,243
Me? Why?

429
00:21:21,689 --> 00:21:23,122
He doesn't like you.

430
00:21:23,289 --> 00:21:26,281
What does he want from me?
I didn't do anything.

431
00:21:26,489 --> 00:21:30,084
See, this is all Elaine's fault. She took
off to Europe with his psychiatrist.

432
00:21:30,249 --> 00:21:32,843
He can't get his medication.
Now I got some nut after me.

433
00:21:33,169 --> 00:21:34,727
Pass the cream.

434
00:21:35,409 --> 00:21:37,047
Wait a second.

435
00:21:38,209 --> 00:21:39,688
All right.

436
00:21:47,289 --> 00:21:48,688
When you vomit on somebody...

437
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,965
...it is a social faux pas...

438
00:21:51,129 --> 00:21:53,643
...from which there
is really no recovery.

439
00:21:53,969 --> 00:21:57,518
At that point, there's really very
little you can say to the person.

440
00:21:57,689 --> 00:22:00,328
There's no Hallmark cards
that cover this occasion.

441
00:22:00,609 --> 00:22:03,521
There's no vomit sympathy-card
section of the store, you know.

442
00:22:03,769 --> 00:22:06,329
"You wear it well."
You know, there's no words...

443
00:22:06,489 --> 00:22:08,400
...that really capture, you know...

444
00:22:08,569 --> 00:22:09,888
"Next time, lunch is on me."

445
00:22:10,049 --> 00:22:14,964
There's no, really,
way to phrase the sentiment.

446
00:22:22,369 --> 00:22:24,519
Where the hell did I put it?

447
00:22:26,849 --> 00:22:28,999
- Where did I put it?
- What are you looking for?

448
00:22:29,169 --> 00:22:31,364
The remote. The remote.
I can't find the remote.

449
00:22:31,529 --> 00:22:33,485
Did I-? I lost it.
Did you take it?

450
00:22:33,649 --> 00:22:35,446
- Did you put it someplace?
- No, no, no.

451
00:22:35,609 --> 00:22:37,247
All right, what is this?

452
00:22:37,529 --> 00:22:41,044
- What is what?
- All right, very funny. I get it.

453
00:22:41,249 --> 00:22:42,807
- You're in a weird mood.
- Come on.

454
00:22:42,969 --> 00:22:44,448
Go to your apartment and fix it.

455
00:22:44,609 --> 00:22:46,406
- Fix what?
- Your pants!

456
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:51,837
What is this? Why do I got
one pant leg on for?

457
00:22:52,009 --> 00:22:56,639
Don't you know? Look at your face. You
only shaved the right side of your face.

458
00:22:57,129 --> 00:22:59,518
- What is this, a joke?
- No joke. What? A joke?

459
00:22:59,689 --> 00:23:01,680
You think this is funny?

460
00:23:02,009 --> 00:23:04,921
Well, look at your face in the mirror.

461
00:23:07,129 --> 00:23:08,403
- Yeah?
- It's George.

462
00:23:08,569 --> 00:23:10,048
Come on up.

463
00:23:11,449 --> 00:23:14,168
- I don't believe this.
- You didn't know you were doing this?

464
00:23:14,329 --> 00:23:16,559
- No, I swear.
- I'll bet this is from that kick...

465
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:20,085
...from Crazy Joe Davola. You better
see a doctor and get some x-rays.

466
00:23:21,849 --> 00:23:23,168
Just the man I'm looking for.

467
00:23:23,329 --> 00:23:24,603
- Me?
- Yeah. Here you go.

468
00:23:24,769 --> 00:23:26,600
- What's this?
- A dry-cleaning bill.

469
00:23:26,769 --> 00:23:28,441
- From that woman at NBC?
- Yeah.

470
00:23:28,609 --> 00:23:32,124
- Dry cleaning bill for what?
- For vomiting on her vest.

471
00:23:32,889 --> 00:23:35,119
Oh, come on, George.
I didn't do that on purpose.

472
00:23:35,329 --> 00:23:37,399
- I shouldn't have to pay.
- Neither should I.

473
00:23:37,569 --> 00:23:39,525
Jerry left the milk in the refrigerator.

474
00:23:39,689 --> 00:23:41,281
- Yeah, it's your milk.
- He drank it.

475
00:23:41,449 --> 00:23:42,768
- I didn't know.
- All right.

476
00:23:42,929 --> 00:23:44,647
Well, we should all chip in, I guess.

477
00:23:44,809 --> 00:23:46,720
- Yeah.
- How much was it to clean the vest?

478
00:23:46,889 --> 00:23:48,447
Eighteen dollars.

479
00:23:48,609 --> 00:23:50,964
Can you get vomit out of suede?

480
00:23:52,329 --> 00:23:54,638
- I don't know.
- Yo-Yo Ma!

481
00:23:57,409 --> 00:23:59,320
What? Yo-Yo Ma?

482
00:24:00,369 --> 00:24:02,041
What about him?

483
00:24:02,209 --> 00:24:04,882
- You just said, "Yo-Yo Ma."
- What's Yo-Yo Ma?

484
00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:06,323
He's a cellist.

485
00:24:06,489 --> 00:24:08,400
You should see a doctor today.

486
00:24:08,569 --> 00:24:10,207
All right. Let's go. Six dollars.

487
00:24:10,369 --> 00:24:12,200
I can't believe
she sent a cleaning bill.

488
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:13,688
I know.

489
00:24:13,849 --> 00:24:15,965
And it doesn't really bode well
for the show.

490
00:24:16,129 --> 00:24:19,326
Forget about the show. We should
take the idea to a different network.

491
00:24:19,489 --> 00:24:20,968
Oh, yeah. Right.

492
00:24:21,129 --> 00:24:23,848
Like anybody's ever gonna do this.

493
00:24:24,009 --> 00:24:25,647
How did you get me to go with that?

494
00:24:25,809 --> 00:24:28,448
A show about nothing.

495
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:33,683
It was a good idea.
Susan liked it.

496
00:24:33,849 --> 00:24:36,966
And if he hadn't vomited all over her,
we'd be writing it right now.

497
00:24:47,489 --> 00:24:49,047
What are you doing?

498
00:24:49,209 --> 00:24:51,769
What's wrong with you?
What are you doing? Give me that.

499
00:24:52,089 --> 00:24:56,128
Go to your apartment and lie down.
I'll make an appointment for a doctor.

500
00:24:59,089 --> 00:25:00,761
Hello? Oh, hi, I'm sorry.

501
00:25:00,929 --> 00:25:03,124
No, that's my neighbour.
He's not quite himself.

502
00:25:03,289 --> 00:25:05,041
He got kicked in the head.

503
00:25:05,369 --> 00:25:07,758
What? Really? You're kidding.

504
00:25:07,929 --> 00:25:11,478
Today? Yeah, sure.
We could make it. Two o'clock?

505
00:25:11,649 --> 00:25:13,241
Yeah, we could do that.

506
00:25:13,489 --> 00:25:15,241
Okay. Great. Thanks a million.

507
00:25:15,409 --> 00:25:16,683
Okay. Bye.

508
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:18,362
- What?
- NBC.

509
00:25:18,649 --> 00:25:20,526
They wanna have another meeting.

510
00:25:20,729 --> 00:25:23,004
They wanna have another meeting?

511
00:25:23,169 --> 00:25:25,922
They wanna buy it!
They wanna buy it! What did I tell you?

512
00:25:26,089 --> 00:25:27,761
We'll be rich!
What are we gonna get?

513
00:25:27,929 --> 00:25:30,045
- Fifty, 60 thousand.
- I don't know about 60.

514
00:25:30,209 --> 00:25:32,359
Oh, it's gotta be 50.

515
00:25:32,569 --> 00:25:34,525
You know how much
Ted Danson makes?

516
00:25:34,689 --> 00:25:37,078
Ted Danson. How are you
comparing us to Ted Danson?

517
00:25:37,249 --> 00:25:40,878
- I didn't say we're Ted Danson.
- You did. You said we're Ted Danson.

518
00:25:41,089 --> 00:25:44,968
- You know, I think he wears a piece.
- Yeah, don't worry. He can afford it.

519
00:25:47,369 --> 00:25:48,961
- What time do you have?
- Five till.

520
00:25:49,129 --> 00:25:52,724
See, I'm 10 minutes slow again. That's
it for this piece of junk. I've had it.

521
00:25:52,889 --> 00:25:55,084
- The one your parents gave you?
- It never works.

522
00:25:55,249 --> 00:25:57,285
We're supposed to be there.
Let's take a cab.

523
00:25:57,449 --> 00:25:59,485
We'll be a little late.
I'm not taking a cab.

524
00:25:59,649 --> 00:26:01,367
- I'll pay for it.
- It's not the money.

525
00:26:01,529 --> 00:26:05,442
What is it you object to? The comfort?
The speed? The convenience?

526
00:26:06,329 --> 00:26:07,887
Jerry!

527
00:26:08,049 --> 00:26:09,846
- Uncle Leo!
- Hello!

528
00:26:10,009 --> 00:26:11,806
Hello there. How you doing?

529
00:26:11,969 --> 00:26:15,120
- How are you? How's Mom and Dad?
- Good. Fine.

530
00:26:15,289 --> 00:26:18,406
Are you getting to be too much
of a big shot now to give me a call?

531
00:26:18,649 --> 00:26:20,401
I don't hear from you anymore.

532
00:26:20,569 --> 00:26:22,480
Oh, no, I've been kind
of busy, that's all.

533
00:26:22,649 --> 00:26:24,560
You know where I just came from?

534
00:26:24,729 --> 00:26:27,084
- Danny Barber.
- Oh, sure. Danny.

535
00:26:27,249 --> 00:26:28,762
He was in the pyjama business.

536
00:26:28,929 --> 00:26:30,521
Remember, I got my pyjamas
for free.

537
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:32,327
I'd come over and give you pyjamas.

538
00:26:32,489 --> 00:26:33,763
Oh, yeah, yeah. I remember.

539
00:26:34,089 --> 00:26:37,240
Funny thing is, I can't wear them.
I get too hot.

540
00:26:37,409 --> 00:26:39,127
I sleep in my underwear
and a T-shirt.

541
00:26:39,289 --> 00:26:43,840
If it gets too hot, I just take the T-shirt
off. Anyway, Danny says to me:

542
00:26:44,009 --> 00:26:46,159
- "You need any pyjamas?"
- I'm sorry, Uncle Leo.

543
00:26:46,329 --> 00:26:48,718
I really gotta get going.

544
00:26:49,409 --> 00:26:52,560
Well, you gotta get going, so go.

545
00:26:52,729 --> 00:26:54,720
We got a meeting
with the president of NBC.

546
00:26:54,929 --> 00:26:57,648
- Nobody got a gun to your head.
- Yeah. I'm really sorry.

547
00:26:57,809 --> 00:26:59,083
Go. Really, I understand.

548
00:26:59,249 --> 00:27:01,365
You got an appointment.
Go to your appointment.

549
00:27:01,529 --> 00:27:03,520
- I'm sorry. Really.
- You know...

550
00:27:03,769 --> 00:27:06,442
...I know plenty of people
in Hollywood too.

551
00:27:07,129 --> 00:27:08,881
Sorry. Really.

552
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:27,924
- Yeah?
- Come on, are you ready? Let's go.

553
00:27:30,489 --> 00:27:32,002
- For what?
- What's with you?

554
00:27:32,169 --> 00:27:34,000
I just talked to you 15 minutes ago.

555
00:27:34,529 --> 00:27:36,121
- About what?
- The courthouse.

556
00:27:36,289 --> 00:27:39,087
You gotta go with me to court.
I'm contesting the ticket.

557
00:27:39,249 --> 00:27:41,843
- I can't. I'm going to the doctor's later.
- You gotta go.

558
00:27:42,009 --> 00:27:44,000
You're my alibi.
You have to take the stand.

559
00:27:44,169 --> 00:27:46,364
- Well, I can't.
- Let me remind you of something.

560
00:27:46,529 --> 00:27:49,362
You wouldn't be here today
if it wasn't for me and my helmet.

561
00:27:49,529 --> 00:27:51,838
I saved your life. You would be dead!

562
00:27:52,009 --> 00:27:55,001
You would cease to exist.
You'd be gone for the rest of eternity.

563
00:27:55,169 --> 00:27:57,205
Can you begin to comprehend
what that means?

564
00:27:57,369 --> 00:28:00,566
Shut up!
I'll get my coat.

565
00:28:00,809 --> 00:28:02,481
Don't step on anything.

566
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:08,448
There are many things that
I think you can point to...

567
00:28:08,609 --> 00:28:11,442
...as proof that the humans
are not smart.

568
00:28:11,769 --> 00:28:15,648
But my personal favourite would have
to be that we had to invent the helmet.

569
00:28:15,809 --> 00:28:17,447
What happened was
we were involved...

570
00:28:17,609 --> 00:28:20,567
...in a lot of activities
that were cracking our heads.

571
00:28:20,729 --> 00:28:24,404
We chose not to avoid doing
these activities, but instead...

572
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:26,480
...to come up with
some sort of device...

573
00:28:26,649 --> 00:28:30,483
...to help us continue enjoying
our head-cracking lifestyles:

574
00:28:30,649 --> 00:28:31,923
The helmet.

575
00:28:32,129 --> 00:28:33,881
Not enough people
were wearing them...

576
00:28:34,049 --> 00:28:36,165
...so we had to come up
with the helmet law...

577
00:28:36,329 --> 00:28:39,048
...which is even stupider.
The idea behind the helmet law...

578
00:28:39,209 --> 00:28:42,645
...is to preserve a brain whose
judgment is so poor...

579
00:28:42,809 --> 00:28:46,802
...it does not even try to stop
the cracking of the head it's in.

580
00:28:48,729 --> 00:28:52,119
Did you see the look on his face?
Did you see how insulted he was?

581
00:28:52,289 --> 00:28:54,439
What could I do?
What are we supposed to do?

582
00:28:54,609 --> 00:28:55,883
You can't leave.

583
00:28:56,049 --> 00:28:59,121
There's no excuse good
enough to justify walking away...

584
00:28:59,289 --> 00:29:01,519
...from a conversation
with one of my relatives.

585
00:29:02,009 --> 00:29:04,682
I didn't shave this morning.
I don't feel like myself.

586
00:29:05,329 --> 00:29:09,641
You could be a fireman on
a fire truck on the way to a fire.

587
00:29:09,809 --> 00:29:12,323
You bump into one of my relatives,
"Sorry, Uncle Leo...

588
00:29:12,489 --> 00:29:16,084
...there's a building full of people
burning down. I do have to be running."

589
00:29:16,409 --> 00:29:21,437
He'll go, "Go. Go ahead.
Go to your fancy fire.

590
00:29:21,889 --> 00:29:25,120
If that's what you have to do."

591
00:29:25,449 --> 00:29:28,407
- Look at this.
- Why didn't you shave this morning?

592
00:29:28,569 --> 00:29:31,129
Because I shaved yesterday
in the afternoon.

593
00:29:31,289 --> 00:29:32,768
- Why?
- Because of the day before.

594
00:29:32,929 --> 00:29:34,647
It's a long story.

595
00:29:34,809 --> 00:29:36,162
I can't get back on schedule.

596
00:29:37,969 --> 00:29:39,766
Is that Joe Davola?

597
00:29:39,929 --> 00:29:42,124
It's not him!

598
00:29:43,049 --> 00:29:44,960
I can't live like this.
I'm being stalked.

599
00:29:45,129 --> 00:29:46,847
Mr. Seinfeld. They're ready for you.

600
00:29:48,009 --> 00:29:50,045
Mr. Seinfeld.
What about Mr. Costanza?

601
00:29:50,209 --> 00:29:51,927
I'm not here?

602
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:53,523
All right. You promised.

603
00:29:53,689 --> 00:29:56,408
You're gonna be a little more
flexible on the nothing idea.

604
00:29:56,569 --> 00:29:59,447
- Just a little.
- All right. A little.

605
00:30:01,489 --> 00:30:03,207
Okay. You all set?
You got your story?

606
00:30:03,369 --> 00:30:04,643
- No.
- When he stopped me...

607
00:30:04,809 --> 00:30:08,768
...I told him I was rushing because
my friend was about to commit suicide.

608
00:30:08,929 --> 00:30:11,682
You're that friend.
All we need is a reason...

609
00:30:11,849 --> 00:30:14,124
...why you were gonna
commit suicide.

610
00:30:16,529 --> 00:30:18,520
I never had an air conditioner.

611
00:30:20,449 --> 00:30:22,485
No. That's no reason to kill yourself.

612
00:30:22,689 --> 00:30:24,839
Why? It gets hot at night.
You can't sleep.

613
00:30:25,049 --> 00:30:26,687
You ever try to sleep in a hot room?

614
00:30:26,849 --> 00:30:29,602
I sleep in a really hot room.
I don't wanna kill myself.

615
00:30:29,809 --> 00:30:32,403
I've slept in really hot rooms
and wanted to kill myself.

616
00:30:32,569 --> 00:30:36,084
No, no, that's not gonna work.
Something else.

617
00:30:37,849 --> 00:30:40,886
I was never able
to become a banker.

618
00:30:42,409 --> 00:30:45,207
Banker! So you're killing yourself...

619
00:30:45,369 --> 00:30:49,248
...because your dreams of becoming
a banker have gone unfulfilled.

620
00:30:49,409 --> 00:30:52,003
You- You- You can't live
without being a banker.

621
00:30:52,169 --> 00:30:55,286
Yeah, yeah. If I can't be a banker,
I don't wanna live.

622
00:30:55,449 --> 00:30:58,168
- You must be a banker!
- Must be a banker!

623
00:30:58,449 --> 00:31:00,360
Okay, we'll go with the banker story.

624
00:31:08,089 --> 00:31:11,843
Story is the foundation
of all entertainment.

625
00:31:12,249 --> 00:31:16,561
You must have a good story.
Otherwise, it's just masturbation.

626
00:31:23,969 --> 00:31:26,199
People really have
to care about the characters.

627
00:31:26,489 --> 00:31:28,241
Care? Forget about care. Love.

628
00:31:28,409 --> 00:31:30,161
They have to love them. Otherwise...

629
00:31:30,329 --> 00:31:31,921
- ... why tune in?
- Wouldn't tune in.

630
00:31:32,089 --> 00:31:34,159
- Would they tune in?
- No tune.

631
00:31:34,969 --> 00:31:37,403
We like to look at a show
as if it were an EKG.

632
00:31:37,569 --> 00:31:40,606
You have your highs and your lows.
And it goes up and down.

633
00:31:40,769 --> 00:31:43,044
This show will be like a heart attack.

634
00:31:43,209 --> 00:31:46,042
Just a huge, massive coronary.

635
00:31:46,209 --> 00:31:48,677
So, what you said last week
about no story...

636
00:31:48,849 --> 00:31:50,680
...you're a little flexible on that now.

637
00:31:51,449 --> 00:31:56,682
Is that what I said, "no story"?
Because Jerry had to tell me later.

638
00:31:56,849 --> 00:31:58,487
He couldn't believe it.

639
00:31:58,649 --> 00:32:01,800
I said- I said, "Get out of here.
No story?

640
00:32:01,969 --> 00:32:04,164
Is that what I said?"

641
00:32:08,489 --> 00:32:11,367
Well, I informed him that he
was exceeding the speed limit...

642
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:14,760
...and that's when he told me
that he was racing home...

643
00:32:14,929 --> 00:32:17,841
...because his friend was
about to commit suicide.

644
00:32:18,409 --> 00:32:19,683
And then what happened?

645
00:32:19,849 --> 00:32:21,441
He became very loud and hysterical.

646
00:32:21,609 --> 00:32:24,328
He was flailing his arms about
as he told the story...

647
00:32:24,489 --> 00:32:26,525
...and then he threw himself
on the ground...

648
00:32:26,689 --> 00:32:28,486
...and he grabbed me
around the legs...

649
00:32:28,649 --> 00:32:31,880
...and he begged me to let him go.
And when I refused...

650
00:32:32,049 --> 00:32:34,847
...that's when he began to scream,
"My friend's going to die.

651
00:32:35,009 --> 00:32:36,283
My friend's going to die."

652
00:32:39,129 --> 00:32:43,247
I don't know how you guys feel, but we
would like to be in business with you.

653
00:32:43,409 --> 00:32:45,445
- We'd like to be in business.
- Love to.

654
00:32:45,609 --> 00:32:47,088
- We'll do business.
- Business.

655
00:32:47,249 --> 00:32:49,319
- Let's have business.
- This is business.

656
00:32:49,489 --> 00:32:53,528
Would it be possible to get
a copy of La Cocina?

657
00:32:55,929 --> 00:32:57,840
Your off-Broadway play.

658
00:33:00,289 --> 00:33:01,688
Gee, you know...

659
00:33:01,849 --> 00:33:04,079
It's- It's the damndest thing. I-

660
00:33:04,249 --> 00:33:07,446
I moved recently,
and my files disappeared.

661
00:33:07,609 --> 00:33:10,760
Now I- I don't know if
they fell off the truck...

662
00:33:10,929 --> 00:33:13,443
...or if there was some foul play,
but let me tell you:

663
00:33:13,609 --> 00:33:15,565
I am not through with
that moving company.

664
00:33:15,729 --> 00:33:17,560
That's my vow to you.

665
00:33:17,769 --> 00:33:20,283
Well, I got a feeling about you two.

666
00:33:20,689 --> 00:33:22,122
And even more than that...

667
00:33:22,289 --> 00:33:24,678
...I place great confidence
in this lady's judgment.

668
00:33:24,849 --> 00:33:26,248
- Good judgment.
- Good judgment.

669
00:33:26,409 --> 00:33:30,163
- That's a pile of judgment.
- Yes. Yes, judgment with earrings on.

670
00:33:30,529 --> 00:33:33,726
So let's make a pilot.

671
00:33:36,849 --> 00:33:38,919
I had gone up to Westchester.

672
00:33:39,449 --> 00:33:41,121
I go every Tuesday.

673
00:33:41,289 --> 00:33:44,008
I do charity work with the blind...

674
00:33:44,209 --> 00:33:47,679
...in my spare time
for the Lighthouse.

675
00:33:47,849 --> 00:33:52,445
I was in the middle of a game of
Parcheesi with an old blind man...

676
00:33:52,609 --> 00:33:55,521
...and I excused myself
to call my friend...

677
00:33:55,689 --> 00:33:57,805
...as he was very depressed lately...

678
00:33:57,969 --> 00:34:00,722
...because he never became
a banker.

679
00:34:01,369 --> 00:34:03,087
I don't understand.

680
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:06,161
You see, it had been his lifelong
dream to be a banker, and he-

681
00:34:06,329 --> 00:34:08,604
Just the day before,
he was turned down by a bank.

682
00:34:08,769 --> 00:34:10,885
I believe it was
the Manufacturers Hanover...

683
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,119
...on Lexington and 40th Street.

684
00:34:13,289 --> 00:34:15,849
That was the third bank in
two weeks to turn him down...

685
00:34:16,009 --> 00:34:19,604
...so I was- I was a little concerned.
I wanted to see how he was doing.

686
00:34:19,769 --> 00:34:22,602
Well, Your Honour,
he was barely audible...

687
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,885
...but I- I distinctly recall him saying-

688
00:34:25,049 --> 00:34:26,641
Hey, Yo-Yo Ma.

689
00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:33,638
So I sped home to save my friend's life,
and I was stopped for speeding.

690
00:34:33,809 --> 00:34:36,642
Yes, I admit I was speeding...

691
00:34:36,809 --> 00:34:39,277
...but it was to save a man's life.

692
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:40,723
A close friend.

693
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:44,564
An innocent person who wanted
nothing more out of life than to love...

694
00:34:44,729 --> 00:34:46,959
...to be loved and to be a banker.

695
00:34:47,609 --> 00:34:49,361
So then he didn't kill himself?

696
00:34:49,689 --> 00:34:51,008
No, sir, he did not.

697
00:34:51,169 --> 00:34:53,205
But only by the grace of God.

698
00:34:53,369 --> 00:34:57,248
He is in the courtroom today,
sitting right over there!

699
00:34:57,609 --> 00:35:01,363
And he can corroborate
my entire testimony.

700
00:35:04,169 --> 00:35:06,888
See! Told you! I told you!

701
00:35:08,969 --> 00:35:10,721
- Now all we gotta do is write it.
- Yes!

702
00:35:10,889 --> 00:35:12,880
How are we gonna do that?

703
00:35:13,769 --> 00:35:15,760
- Hey! Congratulations.
- Thanks.

704
00:35:15,929 --> 00:35:17,362
- Thank you. Thanks.
- Thank you.

705
00:35:17,569 --> 00:35:19,400
You know, I thought
you were mad at me.

706
00:35:19,569 --> 00:35:21,639
Mr. Seinfeld, you have
a telephone call.

707
00:35:22,009 --> 00:35:25,001
Phone call? Who knows I'm here?

708
00:35:26,489 --> 00:35:29,367
Hello? Mom?

709
00:35:30,009 --> 00:35:32,079
How did you know I was here?

710
00:35:32,249 --> 00:35:35,764
Oh, I was not rude to him.
That is baloney!

711
00:35:37,649 --> 00:35:40,766
I couldn't talk. I had a meeting.

712
00:35:40,929 --> 00:35:45,764
I don't know. He- He went off
on some thing about pyjamas.

713
00:35:45,969 --> 00:35:49,564
When you sent me the bill, I thought
the show didn't have a chance.

714
00:35:49,729 --> 00:35:52,243
Oh, it was only vomit.

715
00:35:53,169 --> 00:35:55,444
Anyway, I would like to pay
for the dry cleaning.

716
00:35:55,609 --> 00:35:57,600
- Oh, no, no. It's okay.
- Oh, no, no, no.

717
00:35:57,769 --> 00:35:59,680
We all chipped in.
We have the money.

718
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:03,240
Well, it was $18.

719
00:36:03,769 --> 00:36:08,047
- Okay, $18. There it is. There you go.
- All right.

720
00:36:08,209 --> 00:36:11,007
So maybe we could get
together this weekend.

721
00:36:11,329 --> 00:36:13,206
- Yeah. Call me.
- All right. Great.

722
00:36:13,369 --> 00:36:14,802
- Bye.
- Bye. Thanks.

723
00:36:14,969 --> 00:36:16,288
Bye.

724
00:36:16,969 --> 00:36:19,767
I can't believe she took the money.

725
00:36:21,649 --> 00:36:22,923
Why?

726
00:36:23,089 --> 00:36:25,000
I offered to pay.
She should have said no.

727
00:36:25,169 --> 00:36:27,046
She did. You insisted.

728
00:36:27,369 --> 00:36:31,362
This is what the pilot should be about.
Vomiting on somebody's vest.

729
00:36:31,529 --> 00:36:33,121
How much are we gonna get for this?

730
00:36:33,289 --> 00:36:36,122
- Oh, I- I don't know.
- We gotta get 50. Gotta get 50.

731
00:36:36,289 --> 00:36:38,928
We'll go. You call your manager.
Maybe they made an offer.

732
00:36:39,089 --> 00:36:41,444
- Okay.
- All right, let's go, let's go.

733
00:36:42,969 --> 00:36:44,561
Thirteen thousand?

734
00:36:44,849 --> 00:36:46,123
Thirteen thousand.

735
00:36:46,369 --> 00:36:48,280
- Apiece?
- No, for both.

736
00:36:48,449 --> 00:36:52,408
That's insulting. Ted Danson
makes $800,000 an episode.

737
00:36:52,569 --> 00:36:54,958
- Would you stop with the Ted Danson?
- Well, he does.

738
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:56,528
- You're nuts.
- I'm sorry.

739
00:36:56,689 --> 00:36:59,806
I can't live knowing that Ted Danson
makes that much more than me.

740
00:36:59,969 --> 00:37:01,322
- Who's he?
- He's somebody.

741
00:37:01,489 --> 00:37:02,763
- And me?
- You're nobody.

742
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,965
- Why him? Why not me?
- He's good. You're not.

743
00:37:05,129 --> 00:37:07,563
- I'm better than him.
- You're worse.

744
00:37:07,729 --> 00:37:09,845
Much, much worse.

745
00:37:11,369 --> 00:37:12,722
- There's Davola.
- What? Where?

746
00:37:12,889 --> 00:37:15,528
- Where?
- Outside. I just saw him outside.

747
00:37:21,809 --> 00:37:23,242
What is it?

748
00:37:23,689 --> 00:37:26,157
Oh, it's this patient.

749
00:37:26,809 --> 00:37:28,288
Again?

750
00:37:28,449 --> 00:37:30,167
I'm fairly certain.

751
00:37:30,329 --> 00:37:33,685
I forgot to leave him an extra
prescription for his medication.

752
00:37:33,849 --> 00:37:37,046
Well, so he can live without his
Valium for a couple of days.

753
00:37:37,209 --> 00:37:39,928
No, you don't understand.

754
00:37:40,089 --> 00:37:42,159
He could be dangerous.

755
00:37:45,169 --> 00:37:46,761
Go outside and see if he's there.

756
00:37:46,929 --> 00:37:48,726
I can't go. He knows we're friends.

757
00:37:48,889 --> 00:37:52,848
Well, what am I supposed to do?
I gotta take Kramer to the doctor.

758
00:37:53,129 --> 00:37:55,927
- Tell the cop.
- Good idea.

759
00:38:00,729 --> 00:38:02,003
Excuse me, officer.

760
00:38:02,249 --> 00:38:05,605
There's a guy outside, and he's a
nutjob, and he's waiting to beat me up.

761
00:38:05,769 --> 00:38:08,761
If you could just walk me outside
and wait till I get into a cab.

762
00:38:09,449 --> 00:38:11,917
Yeah, all right. Just-
Just let me get a muffin.

763
00:38:12,489 --> 00:38:14,002
Thanks.

764
00:38:19,889 --> 00:38:22,278
He's gonna get a muffin.
Then he'll walk us outside.

765
00:38:22,449 --> 00:38:25,282
This is a great way
to go through life, isn't it?

766
00:38:25,449 --> 00:38:27,599
Hey, he's looking at the menu now.

767
00:38:28,009 --> 00:38:30,477
What's he looking at the menu for?

768
00:38:31,009 --> 00:38:33,125
I thought you said he was
gonna get a muffin.

769
00:38:40,409 --> 00:38:42,047
What are you doing?

770
00:38:43,449 --> 00:38:45,724
- What?
- What, you're ordering food now?

771
00:38:45,889 --> 00:38:48,244
Yeah. Yeah, I decided
to get a sandwich.

772
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,001
What happened to the muffin?

773
00:38:50,409 --> 00:38:51,683
I got a little hungry.

774
00:38:52,249 --> 00:38:53,762
All of a sudden you get hungry?

775
00:38:54,209 --> 00:38:56,325
Yeah. You got a problem with that?

776
00:38:56,489 --> 00:38:57,763
No.

777
00:38:57,929 --> 00:39:00,318
Enjoy your lunch.

778
00:39:03,209 --> 00:39:05,165
You know, a muffin
can be very filling.

779
00:39:10,129 --> 00:39:13,644
- He's getting a sandwich now.
- I thought he was gonna have a muffin.

780
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:16,118
All of a sudden, he gets hungry.

781
00:39:16,569 --> 00:39:19,367
- You know, a muffin can be very filling.
- I know.

782
00:39:21,369 --> 00:39:23,724
Mr. Kramer...

783
00:39:24,369 --> 00:39:25,961
...you heard the testimony so far.

784
00:39:26,129 --> 00:39:28,518
Would you please tell the court,
in your own words...

785
00:39:28,689 --> 00:39:31,761
...what happened on the afternoon
of September 1 Oth?

786
00:39:32,089 --> 00:39:34,284
What do you mean,
"in my own words"?

787
00:39:34,449 --> 00:39:35,848
Whose words are they gonna be?

788
00:39:36,489 --> 00:39:38,161
You know what I mean.

789
00:39:38,689 --> 00:39:41,362
- I was very upset that day.
- And why was that?

790
00:39:41,969 --> 00:39:44,688
- Would you let me say-? Let me talk.
- All right. Go ahead.

791
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:46,282
- All right.
- Okay.

792
00:39:48,329 --> 00:39:51,560
I was very upset that day because
I could never become a banker.

793
00:39:52,249 --> 00:39:55,764
And this failure to become a banker...

794
00:39:56,089 --> 00:39:59,320
...was eating at you. Eating, eating,
eating at you inside.

795
00:40:00,049 --> 00:40:01,448
Yeah.

796
00:40:03,409 --> 00:40:07,118
It was your family that pushed you into
banking. It was their dream for you.

797
00:40:07,289 --> 00:40:09,086
- Mr. Newman?
- I'm trying to establish...

798
00:40:09,249 --> 00:40:13,288
...Mr. Kramer's fragile emotional state.
My entire case depends on it.

799
00:40:13,449 --> 00:40:14,848
Continue.

800
00:40:15,049 --> 00:40:17,688
- As you were saying, Mr. Kramer?
- What was the question?

801
00:40:17,969 --> 00:40:20,642
You're telling how your parents
pushed you into banking.

802
00:40:21,329 --> 00:40:23,160
Well, my father, when I was a kid...

803
00:40:23,329 --> 00:40:24,921
...he took me to the bank...

804
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:28,286
...and he lifted me up, and he pointed
to the teller, and he said:

805
00:40:28,449 --> 00:40:30,519
"Sonny boy, take a good look
at him.

806
00:40:30,689 --> 00:40:32,839
That's gonna be you someday."

807
00:40:33,369 --> 00:40:38,318
But you never became a banker,
did you, Mr. Kramer?

808
00:40:38,489 --> 00:40:41,162
Why? Why did you fail?

809
00:40:41,329 --> 00:40:43,047
I don't know.

810
00:40:43,209 --> 00:40:44,688
Because you hated your father...

811
00:40:44,849 --> 00:40:46,919
...and you would do anything
to displease him!

812
00:40:47,089 --> 00:40:48,408
Isn't that true?

813
00:40:48,689 --> 00:40:52,045
- Could you get to the speeding?
- Yes, I intend to, Your Honour.

814
00:40:52,209 --> 00:40:55,042
And then, on the afternoon
of September 1 Oth...

815
00:40:55,209 --> 00:40:57,643
...you received a phone call,
did you not?

816
00:40:58,209 --> 00:41:00,165
Phone call?

817
00:41:01,129 --> 00:41:03,199
Yes, a phone call.

818
00:41:03,529 --> 00:41:04,803
From who?

819
00:41:05,369 --> 00:41:06,961
- From me.
- From you?

820
00:41:07,209 --> 00:41:09,564
Yes, from me! From me!
I called you, remember?

821
00:41:09,729 --> 00:41:12,084
- You called me?
- Yes, I called you, you idiot!

822
00:41:12,249 --> 00:41:13,762
Because you were going to...

823
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:15,681
- You were going to... Remember?
- What?

824
00:41:15,849 --> 00:41:17,362
You were gonna- You were gonna-

825
00:41:17,529 --> 00:41:19,201
You were gonna do something...

826
00:41:20,569 --> 00:41:22,560
...to yourself.
You were gonna do something.

827
00:41:22,729 --> 00:41:25,368
Remember the banking! The banking!
It wasn't working out.

828
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,401
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to call-

829
00:41:27,609 --> 00:41:28,962
- Yes, a banker!
- What banker?

830
00:41:29,129 --> 00:41:30,642
You're a banker!

831
00:41:31,649 --> 00:41:33,241
- Your Honour-
- That's enough, Mr. -

832
00:41:33,409 --> 00:41:35,286
Mr. Kramer is obviously
very distraught.

833
00:41:35,449 --> 00:41:37,519
- I'm distraught?
- You shut up!

834
00:41:40,569 --> 00:41:42,878
I demand a recess so that
I can take him outside...

835
00:41:43,049 --> 00:41:44,687
...and help him regain
his composure.

836
00:41:44,849 --> 00:41:46,726
That'll be $75.

837
00:41:46,889 --> 00:41:50,006
What's the matter with you, you jerk?
We had it all worked out!

838
00:41:55,529 --> 00:41:57,008
Is he out there? Do you see him?

839
00:41:57,289 --> 00:41:58,642
I'm not sure.

840
00:41:59,009 --> 00:42:01,159
Well, either you see him or you don't.

841
00:42:02,449 --> 00:42:04,280
All right, I don't.

842
00:42:06,729 --> 00:42:08,720
What is he doing?

843
00:42:09,049 --> 00:42:10,482
Is he getting coffee?

844
00:42:11,449 --> 00:42:13,963
I think he's getting coffee.

845
00:42:14,129 --> 00:42:16,199
What's with this guy?

846
00:42:19,489 --> 00:42:20,968
Did you just order coffee?

847
00:42:22,809 --> 00:42:24,800
- Yeah.
- This is really too much.

848
00:42:24,969 --> 00:42:27,199
- What is your problem?
- I'm sitting over there...

849
00:42:27,369 --> 00:42:29,360
...waiting for you to finish
for 20 minutes.

850
00:42:29,529 --> 00:42:32,089
Now you're drinking coffee.
That's another 10 minutes.

851
00:42:32,649 --> 00:42:35,288
Well, you're just gonna have to wait.

852
00:42:35,809 --> 00:42:37,720
You never said anything
about the banking.

853
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:39,766
- You're off your rocker!
- Hey, you guys.

854
00:42:39,929 --> 00:42:41,328
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

855
00:42:41,489 --> 00:42:43,286
- Why are you here?
- Is Davola outside?

856
00:42:43,489 --> 00:42:44,763
- Davola?
- Yeah.

857
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:46,647
- I didn't see him.
- Crazy Joe Davola?

858
00:42:46,809 --> 00:42:49,369
- Jerry, yours is $11.
- Eleven dollars? For what?

859
00:42:49,529 --> 00:42:50,928
Muffin, sandwich and coffee.

860
00:42:52,529 --> 00:42:54,963
Hey, NBC okayed our idea.
We're gonna make the pilot.

861
00:42:55,169 --> 00:42:56,443
The circus freak show?

862
00:42:56,689 --> 00:42:58,168
- No.
- A pilot?

863
00:42:58,329 --> 00:43:01,480
What do you make for something
like that? Fifty, 60 thousand?

864
00:43:02,209 --> 00:43:04,439
What's the difference?
The money's not important.

865
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:07,760
- Hey, Newman, is that your red car?
- Yeah.

866
00:43:07,929 --> 00:43:09,681
- I think you're getting a ticket.
- Run.

867
00:43:09,849 --> 00:43:11,760
- Go! Go! Go!
- Hey, what are you doing?

868
00:43:11,929 --> 00:43:14,318
It's after 6:00!
You can't give me a ticket!

869
00:43:14,489 --> 00:43:16,878
You're not gonna get away with this.
I'll fight this.

870
00:43:17,049 --> 00:43:19,643
- I've got witnesses.
- I saw the whole thing.

871
00:43:20,089 --> 00:43:21,886
This would be a good idea
for the pilot.

872
00:43:22,049 --> 00:43:23,880
Get out of here.
The vomiting is funnier.

873
00:43:24,089 --> 00:43:25,363
Oh, like you know.

874
00:43:25,529 --> 00:43:26,803
No. You do.

875
00:43:26,969 --> 00:43:30,006
Many states now have traffic school
when you have an infraction.

876
00:43:30,169 --> 00:43:32,080
I went to traffic school.
I didn't mind it.

877
00:43:32,249 --> 00:43:33,682
I felt bad for the instructor.

878
00:43:33,849 --> 00:43:38,001
This guy goes to traffic school
every day, no matter how he drives.

879
00:43:38,169 --> 00:43:40,364
What is his incentive to not speed?

880
00:43:40,729 --> 00:43:43,163
He's going to traffic school, anyway.

881
00:43:43,769 --> 00:43:46,488
Why not get a racecar, do 200 miles
an hour down the street?

882
00:43:46,649 --> 00:43:49,607
Cop stops you."Where you going?"
"Traffic school.""Go ahead.

883
00:43:49,769 --> 00:43:51,805
And you better hurry.
You really need it."

884
00:43:52,649 --> 00:43:55,880
The punishment should be, instead
of traffic school or traffic court...

885
00:43:56,049 --> 00:43:57,846
...just traffic.

886
00:43:58,009 --> 00:44:01,684
They sentence you
to 100 hours of traffic.

887
00:44:01,849 --> 00:44:03,805
Five people drive all around you...

888
00:44:03,969 --> 00:44:06,403
...at five miles an hour
wherever you go.

889
00:44:06,569 --> 00:44:09,129
You're on your way to Vegas.
There isn't a car in sight.

890
00:44:09,889 --> 00:44:11,800
Come on, move it.
