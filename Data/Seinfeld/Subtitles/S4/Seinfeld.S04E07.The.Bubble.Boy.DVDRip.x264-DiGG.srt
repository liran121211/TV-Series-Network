1
00:00:03,569 --> 00:00:06,208
Ever called someone and were
disappointed when they answered?

2
00:00:06,369 --> 00:00:08,360
You wanted the machine.

3
00:00:08,529 --> 00:00:09,757
You're always thrown off.

4
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:13,558
You go, "Oh, I- I didn't know
you were there.

5
00:00:13,729 --> 00:00:18,200
I just wanted to leave a message
saying, 'Sorry I missed you."'

6
00:00:18,409 --> 00:00:21,924
So here's two people who hate each
other, don't really ever wanna talk...

7
00:00:22,209 --> 00:00:25,281
...but the phone machine
is like this relationship respirator...

8
00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:28,009
...keeping these marginal,
brain-dead relationships alive.

9
00:00:28,169 --> 00:00:32,560
We do it so when we come home,
you can see the little flashing red light.

10
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:34,287
You go, "All right, messages."

11
00:00:34,449 --> 00:00:36,360
You see, people need that.

12
00:00:36,529 --> 00:00:39,680
It's very important for human beings
to feel popular and well-liked...

13
00:00:39,849 --> 00:00:42,204
...amongst a large group of people
we don't care for.

14
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:52,643
Well, this is it.

15
00:00:52,809 --> 00:00:54,401
Oh, this is nice.

16
00:00:54,569 --> 00:00:57,242
- Thanks again for the Chinese food.
- Oh, you're welcome.

17
00:00:57,409 --> 00:01:00,048
- I think I ate too much of that garlic.
- Me too.

18
00:01:00,249 --> 00:01:03,878
I ate the whole plate. I didn't know.
I thought they were peanuts.

19
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:11,962
You know what, I think Nak ed Gun
is on. Oh, I've seen it.

20
00:01:12,169 --> 00:01:14,205
I laughed through that whole thing.
Wanna watch?

21
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:15,722
No.

22
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:18,438
- I mean, I don't think so.
- I thought you liked to laugh.

23
00:01:18,609 --> 00:01:20,042
I thought you were
happy-go-lucky.

24
00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:24,999
No, no. I'm not happy,
I'm not lucky, and I don't go.

25
00:01:25,289 --> 00:01:27,245
If anything, I'm sad-stop-unlucky.

26
00:01:28,609 --> 00:01:31,407
That's not funny, Naomi.
I didn't mean to be funny there.

27
00:01:31,809 --> 00:01:35,404
Why don't you check the TV Guide?
I think Ho/ocaust is on.

28
00:01:39,249 --> 00:01:42,639
Jerry, it's George. You a/ set for the
week end? This is gonna be great.

29
00:01:42,809 --> 00:01:44,401
You'/ have a great time with Naomi.

30
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:46,287
A/ right, she's got that /augh.

31
00:01:46,449 --> 00:01:49,646
What'd you say, it's /ik e E/mer Fudd
sitting on a juicer?

32
00:01:49,889 --> 00:01:52,164
I was thinking we'd tak e two cars
up to the cabin.

33
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:54,479
That way, you know, if one of us
wanted to stay-

34
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:00,082
This thing has never worked right.

35
00:02:00,849 --> 00:02:03,727
You think I laugh like Elmer Fudd
sitting on a juicer?

36
00:02:03,889 --> 00:02:07,325
Well, first of all, Elmer Fudd
is one of the most beloved...

37
00:02:07,489 --> 00:02:10,686
...internationally known
cartoon characters of all time.

38
00:02:10,849 --> 00:02:12,362
"I'm gonna kill that cwazy wabbit."

39
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:17,765
Come on! Not only that, a juicer
is one of the healthiest ways-

40
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:22,366
It makes juice, it extracts the pulp
and- And then the vitamins.

41
00:02:22,529 --> 00:02:26,442
For long life and vitality.

42
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:29,962
How could you leave
a message like that?

43
00:02:30,129 --> 00:02:31,801
How could you play it to just anyone?

44
00:02:31,969 --> 00:02:33,288
I didn't think you'd leave it.

45
00:02:33,449 --> 00:02:36,521
- I didn't think you'd play it.
- Now she's not coming this weekend.

46
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:39,408
What do you mean, not going?
We got plans. Call her up.

47
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:41,127
Ah, it's better anyway.

48
00:02:41,289 --> 00:02:43,280
I mean, really.
What was gonna happen?

49
00:02:43,449 --> 00:02:46,680
I'm a comedian. How can I go out
with a girl with a laugh like that?

50
00:02:47,369 --> 00:02:50,361
It's like Coco Chanel going out
with a fishmonger.

51
00:02:51,809 --> 00:02:56,087
You know, she's with all the perfumes,
and a fishmonger's a pretty bad smell.

52
00:02:59,609 --> 00:03:01,088
Well, maybe you should ask Elaine.

53
00:03:01,249 --> 00:03:03,399
But if I ask Elaine,
Kramer will feel slighted.

54
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:07,118
Oh, no, no. Don't say anything
to Kramer. Susan can't stand him.

55
00:03:07,289 --> 00:03:09,723
He vomited all over her.

56
00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:13,358
Wait a minute. Do you smell smoke?

57
00:03:13,529 --> 00:03:16,168
- Ah, Kramer.
- Hello, boys.

58
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:17,921
Top of the morning to you.

59
00:03:18,089 --> 00:03:19,727
What do you say? What do you be?

60
00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:22,205
Put that thing out before you start
another fire.

61
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:23,802
You had to give him cigars.

62
00:03:24,369 --> 00:03:27,042
So, what are you guys
doing this weekend?

63
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:29,798
- Ah, we're...
- Because I'm gonna be playing golf...

64
00:03:29,969 --> 00:03:32,483
...at the Westchester Country Club.

65
00:03:32,649 --> 00:03:34,446
Westchester? Isn't that a private club?

66
00:03:34,609 --> 00:03:38,158
That's right, buddy.
It's private. It's very private.

67
00:03:39,089 --> 00:03:42,798
I met the pro at the golf shop up on
49th Street. I gave him a Cuban...

68
00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:44,880
...and he invites me for a free round.

69
00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:49,167
Then he says, anytime I lay one of
these on him, it'll be the same deal.

70
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:50,762
- Wow.
- Isn't that beautiful?

71
00:03:50,929 --> 00:03:53,284
Man, I'm gonna be hitting
the links all weekend.

72
00:03:55,649 --> 00:03:58,402
- Gee, that's- That's too bad.
- Yeah. Too bad.

73
00:03:58,689 --> 00:04:00,759
- Why? What? What?
- Because we were just saying...

74
00:04:00,929 --> 00:04:02,920
...we were gonna ask you
to the country.

75
00:04:03,089 --> 00:04:05,842
Susan's father has a cabin up there,
but all right.

76
00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:07,880
They got any
golf courses up there?

77
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:10,199
No, no, no.

78
00:04:10,369 --> 00:04:12,519
- No, no, that's pie country.
- Yeah.

79
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:14,725
Yeah, they do a lot of baking up there.

80
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:17,005
They sell them by the road.
Blueberry, blackberry.

81
00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:19,239
- Blackberry, boysenberry.
- Boysenberry, huckleberry.

82
00:04:19,409 --> 00:04:21,445
- Raspberry, strawberry.
- Strawberry, cranberry.

83
00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:23,167
Peach.

84
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:28,799
- I don't know.
- Come on, I don't wanna tag along...

85
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:31,403
...with George and Susan.
With you, it's a better group.

86
00:04:31,849 --> 00:04:34,124
- What's that?
- Oh, it's an autographed picture...

87
00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:37,247
...for my dry cleaner. I never know
what to write on these things.

88
00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:39,206
I hate doing this.

89
00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:43,008
"I'm very impressed"?

90
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:47,325
You mean "pressed"
because it's a dry cleaner?

91
00:04:47,489 --> 00:04:49,605
Yeah, see? That's why I hate it.

92
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:51,680
So come on, you wanna go?

93
00:04:52,289 --> 00:04:55,645
Well, what about the sleeping
arrangements in the cabin?

94
00:04:56,049 --> 00:05:01,601
Well... Same bed,
and underwear and a T-shirt.

95
00:05:02,289 --> 00:05:05,008
- What about me?
- Well, you'd be naked, of course.

96
00:05:07,369 --> 00:05:10,042
- Excuse me. Jerry Seinfeld?
- Yeah.

97
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:13,804
My names Sanger, Mel Sanger.
I drive that truck out there.

98
00:05:13,969 --> 00:05:15,641
- The Yoo-hoo?
- Yeah.

99
00:05:15,809 --> 00:05:18,528
- I love Yoo-hoo.
- Yes, it's a fine product.

100
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:21,044
I saw you on The Tonight Show
a couple of weeks ago.

101
00:05:21,209 --> 00:05:23,404
I was watching the show
with my son Donald.

102
00:05:23,569 --> 00:05:26,288
He's got this rare immune deficiency
in his blood.

103
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:30,124
The damnedest thing. Doctors say
he has to live in a plastic bubble.

104
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:31,881
Can you imagine that? A bubble.

105
00:05:32,049 --> 00:05:33,721
- A bubble?
- A bubble?

106
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:35,641
Yes, a bubble.

107
00:05:35,929 --> 00:05:38,204
- Do you mind? May I?
- Oh, sure.

108
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:42,917
It'd break your heart
seeing him in there.

109
00:05:43,089 --> 00:05:46,877
He's like a prisoner.
No friends. Just his mother and me.

110
00:05:47,049 --> 00:05:50,121
And I'm out there six days
a week hauling Yoo-hoo.

111
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:54,923
We have sacrificed everything,
all for the sake of our little...

112
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:57,159
...bubble boy.

113
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:00,561
- Excuse me.
- Oh, here.

114
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:11,004
Excuse me.

115
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:14,043
Anyway, we were watching
you on TV...

116
00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:15,608
You get in the bubble with him?

117
00:06:15,769 --> 00:06:17,885
No. He can see through the bubble,
it's plastic.

118
00:06:18,049 --> 00:06:21,837
- Oh, I thought it was like an igloo.
- No. It's clear.

119
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:23,648
Who has the remote?

120
00:06:23,809 --> 00:06:25,162
He does.

121
00:06:25,329 --> 00:06:27,160
The remote goes through the bubble?

122
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:30,241
Yeah. He's in the bubble
with the remote.

123
00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:32,525
So you have no control
over the remote?

124
00:06:32,689 --> 00:06:34,520
No. It's frustrating.

125
00:06:35,649 --> 00:06:37,560
Yeah. Of course. Yeah.

126
00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:39,845
So anyway,
you're his favourite comedian.

127
00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:41,601
He laughed so hard the other night...

128
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:43,885
...we had to give him
an extra shot of haemoglobin.

129
00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:46,522
That's nice.

130
00:06:46,769 --> 00:06:48,327
Tomorrow is his birthday.

131
00:06:48,489 --> 00:06:52,448
And it would mean so much to him
if you could find it in your heart...

132
00:06:52,609 --> 00:06:56,602
- ... to pay him a visit and just say hello.
- Oh, well, tomorrow, I-

133
00:06:56,769 --> 00:07:00,284
Jerry. Of course he'd pay him a visit.
You'd be happy to.

134
00:07:00,729 --> 00:07:03,038
Yeah. Okay...

135
00:07:03,209 --> 00:07:06,246
Tomorrow. Where do you live?
Uptown? Up Westside?

136
00:07:06,649 --> 00:07:09,322
- No. Upstate.
- Upstate.

137
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,840
He's a bubble boy!

138
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:18,686
- A bubble boy?
- Yes, a bubble boy.

139
00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:21,966
- What's a bubble boy?
- He lives in a bubble.

140
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:23,728
Boy.

141
00:07:26,609 --> 00:07:28,645
What kind of a bubble, like an igloo?

142
00:07:28,809 --> 00:07:32,518
No, that's what I thought. It's
a piece of plastic dividing the room.

143
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:36,401
What kind of plastic do you think it is?
Like that dry-cleaning plastic?

144
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:38,400
That's no good.

145
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:40,685
He wouldn't last 10 minutes in there.

146
00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:43,284
What can I do?
I promised I'd go visit him tomorrow.

147
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:45,246
It's his birthday.
I can't go to the cabin.

148
00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:48,606
- Well, where does he live?
- I don't know. Upstate. Fall-something.

149
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:51,567
Wait a minute. This is right
on the way to the cabin.

150
00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:55,608
Oh, all right. Beautiful. So you stop in,
visit the bubble boy for 20 minutes...

151
00:07:55,769 --> 00:07:57,327
- ... then we can go.
- You think so?

152
00:07:57,489 --> 00:08:00,287
I know exactly where this is.
You can just follow us.

153
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:02,519
Oh, great. Okay, we're going away.

154
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:05,078
- I think I'm excited.
- I'm excited.

155
00:08:05,249 --> 00:08:08,559
Oh, you're gonna love this cabin.
My grandfather built it in 1947.

156
00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:12,005
- It's incredible.
- There you go. It's a '47 cabin.

157
00:08:12,329 --> 00:08:14,923
- So we'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

158
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:17,000
Well, hey.

159
00:08:17,209 --> 00:08:19,245
Very nice. Very nice.

160
00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:22,441
- Well, I'm off to the links.
- Yeah.

161
00:08:22,609 --> 00:08:24,327
I wanna thank you
for the invite upstate.

162
00:08:24,489 --> 00:08:25,638
I'm sorry I can't make it.

163
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:27,800
- The what?
- Nothing. Let's get going. Come on.

164
00:08:27,969 --> 00:08:29,960
- Did you-?
- No, no, we'll talk about it later.

165
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:32,848
Is that one of the cigars
my father gave you?

166
00:08:36,689 --> 00:08:39,567
Hey, what's with George and Susan?
Does he actually like her?

167
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:43,085
I don't know if he likes her
as much as he likes it.

168
00:08:43,369 --> 00:08:44,848
Oh, that's nice.

169
00:08:45,009 --> 00:08:46,965
What's he doing? What is his hurry?

170
00:08:47,129 --> 00:08:49,802
Oh, you know George.
He's gotta make "good time."

171
00:08:49,969 --> 00:08:53,484
He once went from West 81 st St.
to Kennedy airport in 25 minutes.

172
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:55,321
I never heard the end of it.

173
00:08:55,649 --> 00:08:57,162
Look at him.

174
00:08:57,649 --> 00:08:59,685
Would you stop that, please?
Just stop that.

175
00:08:59,849 --> 00:09:02,807
- Why?
- Knock it off. You're distracting me.

176
00:09:02,969 --> 00:09:05,005
We're making incredible time here.

177
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:09,959
I once made it to Kennedy airport
from West 81 St. in 15 minutes.

178
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:12,804
Oh, here. Hold this.
It's $10 for the tolls.

179
00:09:13,409 --> 00:09:15,081
What's he doing?
Is he out of his mind?

180
00:09:15,409 --> 00:09:17,969
Do you see him? I don't even
see him anymore. Where is he?

181
00:09:18,449 --> 00:09:20,679
- Isn't that blue car him?
- No, no, that's not him.

182
00:09:20,849 --> 00:09:23,841
What happened to him?
I can't believe it. I lost him.

183
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:25,442
That stupid idiot.

184
00:09:25,609 --> 00:09:27,804
- Now what are we gonna do?
- It's no big deal, Jerry.

185
00:09:27,969 --> 00:09:29,925
We'll just meet him
at the bubble boy's house.

186
00:09:30,089 --> 00:09:32,045
I don't even know
where the bubble boy lives.

187
00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:34,359
I don't even remember the name
of the town.

188
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:36,963
- You don't have the directions?
- No, I was following him!

189
00:09:37,129 --> 00:09:38,767
How could you not take the directions?

190
00:09:38,929 --> 00:09:41,079
Because he's my directions.

191
00:09:44,849 --> 00:09:46,282
I don't see them, George.

192
00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:48,804
You make plans,
then he goes 100 miles an hour...

193
00:09:48,969 --> 00:09:50,880
...the weekend's over just like that.

194
00:09:51,489 --> 00:09:52,683
Poor little bubble boy.

195
00:09:52,849 --> 00:09:56,205
He's sitting there waiting for you
in his bubble or igloo thing, whatever.

196
00:09:56,369 --> 00:09:58,758
I don't know what to do.
I don't know where I am.

197
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:02,161
Just get off at this exit.
We'll figure something out.

198
00:10:03,249 --> 00:10:05,888
We lost them. Do you know that?
We lost them.

199
00:10:06,049 --> 00:10:07,243
Well, it's not my fault.

200
00:10:07,409 --> 00:10:09,969
Seinfeld can't drive.
How hard is it to follow somebody?

201
00:10:10,129 --> 00:10:12,085
Well, now what are you gonna do?

202
00:10:12,449 --> 00:10:15,009
It's fine. We'll just meet him
at the bubble boy's house.

203
00:10:15,729 --> 00:10:17,242
Does he have the address?

204
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:25,520
Yeah.

205
00:10:31,009 --> 00:10:33,477
Leave a message,
I'/ ca/ you back. Thanks.

206
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:35,958
Hi, Jerry. It's Naomi.

207
00:10:36,129 --> 00:10:39,121
Listen, if it's not too /ate,
I changed my mind.

208
00:10:39,289 --> 00:10:42,247
- I'd /ik e to go to the cabin.
- Wait. Wait.

209
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:44,684
Yeah, hello. Hi.

210
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:46,567
This is Kramer.

211
00:10:46,809 --> 00:10:49,118
Yeah. I'm the next-door neighbour.

212
00:10:49,609 --> 00:10:54,046
You know, Jerry's left, but listen,
you see, my golf game got cancelled.

213
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:55,961
I'm thinking of going up myself.

214
00:10:56,129 --> 00:10:59,326
They got pies,
and I got the directions right here.

215
00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:06,566
I drive all the way
to the country club...

216
00:11:06,729 --> 00:11:09,163
...and then I find out
there's a tournament going on.

217
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:11,765
- You mind if I smoke?
- No.

218
00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:13,487
These are Cubans.

219
00:11:24,929 --> 00:11:26,647
I don't know if this is the house.

220
00:11:26,809 --> 00:11:29,084
I don't see Jerry's car anywhere.

221
00:11:30,249 --> 00:11:32,479
Would you stop it?

222
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:35,083
Would you quit it, please?
Someone is gonna see us here.

223
00:11:35,249 --> 00:11:36,841
So what?

224
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:39,239
You are such a prude.

225
00:11:39,409 --> 00:11:41,843
Hey. I am not a prude, sweetheart.

226
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:44,603
I swing with the best of them.

227
00:11:44,849 --> 00:11:46,760
- Come on, let's go in.
- What?

228
00:11:46,929 --> 00:11:50,080
We should tell them what happened.
They might be very late...

229
00:11:50,249 --> 00:11:52,717
- ... if they make it all.
- I can't go in there.

230
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,528
I can't face the bubble boy.

231
00:11:55,009 --> 00:11:59,082
- What's the matter?
- I don't react well to these situations.

232
00:11:59,849 --> 00:12:03,046
My grandmother died two months early
from how I reacted in the hospital.

233
00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:05,245
She was getting better.
Then I paid her a visit.

234
00:12:05,409 --> 00:12:07,877
She saw my face, boom.
That was the end of her.

235
00:12:08,049 --> 00:12:09,448
- We're going in.
- Wait, please-

236
00:12:09,609 --> 00:12:12,362
- Come on, George. George, stop.
- Would you wait one moment-

237
00:12:15,809 --> 00:12:18,243
I can't believe a little thing
like George speeding...

238
00:12:18,409 --> 00:12:21,481
...and my whole weekend is gone.
The plans, the packing. Everything.

239
00:12:21,649 --> 00:12:24,163
Your whole weekend?
What about the bubble boy?

240
00:12:24,329 --> 00:12:26,126
Why do you keep bringing up
the bubble boy?

241
00:12:26,289 --> 00:12:28,928
You don't have to mention him.
I know about the bubble boy.

242
00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:30,522
I'm aware of the bubble boy.

243
00:12:30,689 --> 00:12:33,647
Why do you keep reminding me
about the bubble boy?

244
00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:39,889
I'll have a cup of coffee
and a turkey club.

245
00:12:40,049 --> 00:12:42,609
- How about you?
- I'll just have a glass of water.

246
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,288
You can't just have water.

247
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,362
Why not? That's all I want.

248
00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:50,918
This isn't a park bench
where you come in and sit down.

249
00:12:51,089 --> 00:12:52,568
It's a business.

250
00:12:54,609 --> 00:12:56,122
Hold it a second.

251
00:12:56,289 --> 00:12:57,802
Don't you play on TV?

252
00:12:58,809 --> 00:13:02,279
- Oh, no.
- Yes. Yes, you saw him on TV.

253
00:13:02,689 --> 00:13:04,680
- What's your name?
- Jerry Seinfeld.

254
00:13:04,849 --> 00:13:07,727
- Elaine...
- Gary Seinfield.

255
00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:10,039
- I saw you on The Tonight Show.
- Right.

256
00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:11,961
Wouldn't you like
an autographed picture?

257
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:15,125
I don't have any more pictures, Elaine.

258
00:13:15,289 --> 00:13:17,564
He's lying. They're in the trunk.

259
00:13:17,729 --> 00:13:20,448
- Now you get to sign another one.
- I'm not lying.

260
00:13:20,609 --> 00:13:22,440
Yeah. Yeah, he is.

261
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:26,167
She'll have a cup of coffee
and a broiled chicken.

262
00:13:29,489 --> 00:13:31,719
See, it's not really a bubble.

263
00:13:31,929 --> 00:13:36,605
A lot of people think it's an igloo,
but it's really just a plastic divider.

264
00:13:46,569 --> 00:13:48,207
Can you go in the bubble?

265
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,406
Well, you have to put so many things
on because of the germs.

266
00:13:51,569 --> 00:13:54,208
The gloves, the mask,
it's a whole production.

267
00:13:55,129 --> 00:13:56,357
So then he makes his own bed?

268
00:13:56,689 --> 00:13:59,806
Well, that's one of the things
we fight about.

269
00:14:00,849 --> 00:14:02,043
Would you like to meet him?

270
00:14:02,289 --> 00:14:05,008
- Ah, well, you know-
- Oh, he loves games.

271
00:14:05,249 --> 00:14:07,160
Maybe you could play Trivial Pursuit
with him.

272
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:11,158
Hey, Ma! What the hell do I gotta
do to get some food around here?

273
00:14:11,449 --> 00:14:15,237
I'm starving. And if it's peanut butter,
I'm gonna shove it in your face!

274
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:27,041
- One picture left in the trunk.
- Thanks. This is fun.

275
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:29,560
Yeah, this turned out to be
a great weekend.

276
00:14:29,729 --> 00:14:31,242
Where's my water?

277
00:14:31,409 --> 00:14:33,639
Oh, it's coming.

278
00:14:34,449 --> 00:14:36,326
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

279
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:38,407
What'd you write?

280
00:14:38,569 --> 00:14:41,003
"Nothing's finer
than being in your diner."

281
00:14:47,369 --> 00:14:50,281
There is "nothing finer than being
in your diner"?

282
00:14:50,449 --> 00:14:53,327
- No good?
- This is what you came up with?

283
00:14:53,489 --> 00:14:54,922
Well?

284
00:14:55,089 --> 00:14:56,727
That is so lame, Jerry.

285
00:14:56,889 --> 00:15:00,518
People will be reading that for the
next 20 years and laughing at you.

286
00:15:00,849 --> 00:15:03,568
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

287
00:15:03,729 --> 00:15:05,640
Would you mind?
I'd like the picture back.

288
00:15:05,809 --> 00:15:08,164
- Why?
- I'm not happy with what I wrote.

289
00:15:08,369 --> 00:15:11,122
- It's good. I like it.
- No, believe me, it's not good.

290
00:15:11,289 --> 00:15:13,325
I'll mail you one with something
really funny.

291
00:15:13,489 --> 00:15:16,128
Well, when you mail me a new one,
I'll send you back this one.

292
00:15:16,289 --> 00:15:18,519
You don't understand.
I want the picture.

293
00:15:18,689 --> 00:15:20,042
Right.

294
00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:29,841
This is Donald.

295
00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:31,203
- Hi.
- Hello.

296
00:15:31,369 --> 00:15:32,518
Who are you?

297
00:15:32,689 --> 00:15:35,078
- Where's Seinfeld?
- He's on his way.

298
00:15:35,249 --> 00:15:36,682
These are his friends.

299
00:15:37,409 --> 00:15:38,603
What are you looking at?

300
00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:41,237
Never seen a kid in a bubble before?

301
00:15:44,409 --> 00:15:46,923
Of course I have. Come on.

302
00:15:47,089 --> 00:15:49,808
My cousin's in a bubble.

303
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:54,005
My friend Jeffrey's sister also,
bubble, you know...

304
00:15:54,249 --> 00:15:56,683
I got a lot of bubble experience.
Come on.

305
00:15:57,489 --> 00:16:01,118
- What's your story?
- I have no story.

306
00:16:01,289 --> 00:16:03,325
She works for NBC.

307
00:16:03,489 --> 00:16:05,764
How about taking your top off?

308
00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:09,401
Donald, behave yourself.

309
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:11,127
Come on.

310
00:16:11,289 --> 00:16:12,927
I know, I know.

311
00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:15,239
Why don't you play
a game of Trivial Pursuit?

312
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:17,161
Ah, you know, we gotta be running-

313
00:16:17,329 --> 00:16:18,967
What, are you afraid?

314
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:23,688
- No. You see, it's-
- I'm gonna kick your ass.

315
00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:26,761
I was nice enough
to give you the picture.

316
00:16:26,929 --> 00:16:30,524
I don't like what I wrote. I don't want
it up there. Please just give it back.

317
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:33,478
You are really starting
to get under my skin.

318
00:16:33,649 --> 00:16:36,209
- I want that picture.
- Well, you can't have it.

319
00:16:36,369 --> 00:16:39,008
In fact, maybe you better
just pay your check, and get out.

320
00:16:39,169 --> 00:16:41,160
I'm not paying until I get that back.

321
00:16:41,329 --> 00:16:43,081
Well, you ain't getting it back.

322
00:16:43,249 --> 00:16:45,922
Well, maybe I'll just take it back.

323
00:16:47,249 --> 00:16:50,047
This chicken is really good.

324
00:16:52,889 --> 00:16:55,084
Okay, history.

325
00:16:55,249 --> 00:16:56,921
This is for the game.

326
00:16:57,329 --> 00:16:59,126
How you doing over there?

327
00:16:59,449 --> 00:17:01,804
Not too good.

328
00:17:02,769 --> 00:17:04,725
All right, bubble boy.

329
00:17:04,889 --> 00:17:06,800
Let's just play.

330
00:17:06,969 --> 00:17:10,120
"Who invaded Spain
in the eighth century?"

331
00:17:10,289 --> 00:17:12,325
That's a joke. The Moors.

332
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:14,480
Oh, no.

333
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:17,007
I'm so sorry. It's the "Moops."

334
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:19,285
The correct answer is the Moops.

335
00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:22,361
Moops? Let me see that.

336
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:26,037
That's not Moops, you jerk.

337
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:28,359
It's Moors. It's a misprint.

338
00:17:28,529 --> 00:17:31,805
I'm sorry. The card says Moops.

339
00:17:33,729 --> 00:17:38,245
It doesn't matter. It's Moors.
There's no Moops.

340
00:17:38,529 --> 00:17:41,601
- It's Moops.
- Moors.

341
00:17:41,969 --> 00:17:44,881
- Moops.
- Moors!

342
00:17:48,729 --> 00:17:50,162
Hey!

343
00:17:50,609 --> 00:17:52,042
Anybody home?

344
00:17:53,849 --> 00:17:56,602
- Oh, boy.
- What should we do?

345
00:17:57,489 --> 00:17:59,764
Hold these pies.

346
00:18:01,729 --> 00:18:03,162
Okay.

347
00:18:11,689 --> 00:18:12,963
Help. Someone...

348
00:18:13,129 --> 00:18:16,087
- There's no Moops, you idiot!
- Stop it! Let go of him.

349
00:18:16,249 --> 00:18:19,286
Donald. Stop it.
Now, let go of him, Donald.

350
00:18:19,449 --> 00:18:21,963
- I'm gonna kill him.
- He's choking me.

351
00:18:22,129 --> 00:18:23,881
- Donald. Stop.
- Moors!

352
00:18:24,049 --> 00:18:25,402
Say Moors!

353
00:18:25,569 --> 00:18:27,048
Moops. Moops.

354
00:18:27,209 --> 00:18:29,040
Donald, stop it.

355
00:18:38,609 --> 00:18:40,565
What are you doing?
You're choking me. Elaine!

356
00:18:40,729 --> 00:18:43,687
- Are you gonna pay today?
- No, I want that picture back!

357
00:18:43,849 --> 00:18:45,487
Something's happened
to the bubble boy!

358
00:18:45,649 --> 00:18:47,367
- They're rushing him to hospital.
- What?

359
00:18:47,529 --> 00:18:49,724
The bubble boy?
He lives around here?

360
00:18:49,889 --> 00:18:51,242
That's his house, down the road.

361
00:18:51,409 --> 00:18:52,888
He got in a fight with some guy.

362
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:55,244
Who kind of a person would hurt
the bubble boy?

363
00:18:55,409 --> 00:18:57,479
Some little bald guy from the city.

364
00:18:57,649 --> 00:19:01,801
Come on, Vern. Page, Preston, don't
you think we ought to do something?

365
00:19:04,049 --> 00:19:06,005
Naomi, come on, let's get going.

366
00:19:06,169 --> 00:19:08,046
But that lake must be freezing.

367
00:19:08,209 --> 00:19:09,801
No, it's good for you.

368
00:19:09,969 --> 00:19:11,960
Retards the aging process.

369
00:19:16,609 --> 00:19:18,600
Ready to go swimming?

370
00:19:18,769 --> 00:19:20,122
Let's go.

371
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:21,483
Okay.

372
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:31,719
Jerry, what happened to you?

373
00:19:31,889 --> 00:19:34,244
What happened to you?
You were going 100 miles an hour.

374
00:19:34,409 --> 00:19:36,047
I was not.
Bubble boy tried to kill me.

375
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:37,767
- What?
- Susan, tell them.

376
00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:40,079
It's a long story.

377
00:19:41,009 --> 00:19:43,603
- Hey, Seinfeld.
- Hey, happy birthday.

378
00:19:43,769 --> 00:19:45,122
Thanks for showing up.

379
00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:47,883
- You know, your friend tried to kill me.
- He's a lying snot.

380
00:19:48,049 --> 00:19:49,880
He's a cheater, aren't you,
little twerp?

381
00:19:50,049 --> 00:19:51,323
- Moors!
- Moops!

382
00:19:51,569 --> 00:19:53,446
- Moors!
- Moops!

383
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:56,840
There's the guy who tried to kill
the bubble boy. Get him!

384
00:20:06,089 --> 00:20:08,000
Fire engines.

385
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,720
Must be a big one.

386
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,966
Do you smell something?

387
00:20:18,209 --> 00:20:19,688
- Yeah.
- Smoke.

388
00:20:19,849 --> 00:20:21,885
Yeah. Definite smoke.

389
00:20:22,809 --> 00:20:24,447
Look, it's a fire!

390
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:27,158
Holy cow, look at that!

391
00:20:27,409 --> 00:20:30,765
- It's my father's cabin!
- The cabin is on fire.

392
00:20:32,329 --> 00:20:36,527
I just realized, you never gave
me back the change from the tolls.

393
00:20:38,289 --> 00:20:40,359
How could this have happened?

394
00:20:43,569 --> 00:20:44,843
Oh, my God. The cabin.

395
00:20:45,009 --> 00:20:46,328
What are you two doing here?

396
00:20:46,489 --> 00:20:48,081
Look at that.

397
00:20:49,569 --> 00:20:51,127
Hey, you didn't:

398
00:20:52,089 --> 00:20:53,886
My Cubans.

399
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:59,198
Something very scary
and exciting about fire.

400
00:20:59,369 --> 00:21:00,768
People always run to see a fire.

401
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:03,648
They're very proud
if they have a fireplace.

402
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:06,084
I think that's what smoking
is really all about.

403
00:21:06,249 --> 00:21:08,399
That's the power of smoking.
It's just this thing:

404
00:21:08,569 --> 00:21:10,844
"I got fire right here in my hand.

405
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:14,764
Smoke and fire is literally
coming right out of my mouth."

406
00:21:14,929 --> 00:21:16,920
And it's very intimidating
to the nonsmoker.

407
00:21:17,089 --> 00:21:18,568
It's like talking to someone going:

408
00:21:18,729 --> 00:21:20,685
"My head could open up.
Lava could explode out.

409
00:21:20,849 --> 00:21:23,761
Pour right down my face.
Doesn't bother me a bit."

410
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,802
And a cigar is even worse.

411
00:21:25,969 --> 00:21:27,448
I mean, a cigar is like:

412
00:21:27,609 --> 00:21:31,966
You think this end is bad.
Look at this wet, disgusting nub, huh?

413
00:21:32,129 --> 00:21:34,438
How scary is that?

414
00:22:22,689 --> 00:22:24,680
