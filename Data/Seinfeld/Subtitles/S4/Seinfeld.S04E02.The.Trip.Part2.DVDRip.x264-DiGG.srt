1
00:00:03,809 --> 00:00:05,606
Last week on Seinfeld.

2
00:00:05,769 --> 00:00:07,248
Yeah, I'm here for the audition.

3
00:00:07,409 --> 00:00:09,161
The Tonight Show called
and they want me...

4
00:00:09,329 --> 00:00:12,048
...to do the show on the 28th.
They're giving me tickets to L.A.

5
00:00:12,209 --> 00:00:13,562
- You wanna go?
- A free ticket?

6
00:00:13,729 --> 00:00:15,367
In fact, we could track down Kramer.

7
00:00:15,529 --> 00:00:18,362
I got a very big meeting. I got people
interested in my treatment.

8
00:00:18,529 --> 00:00:20,201
- Pretty young thing.
- She was.

9
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:22,564
It's a two-day trip.
What are you, Diana Ross?

10
00:00:22,729 --> 00:00:25,562
Ladies and gentlemen,
I implore you.

11
00:00:25,729 --> 00:00:27,685
Don't look. Don't look.
It's Fred Savage.

12
00:00:28,209 --> 00:00:31,087
Did I frighten you?
I may look weird, but I'm just like you.

13
00:00:31,249 --> 00:00:33,968
I'm just a regular guy, just trying
to make it in this business.

14
00:00:34,129 --> 00:00:36,359
- No witnesses?
- Just the trees, Johnny.

15
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:37,922
Just the trees.

16
00:00:38,089 --> 00:00:40,762
Could you not tuck the blankets in?

17
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:42,840
Because I can't sleep all tucked in.

18
00:00:46,849 --> 00:00:48,362
I think we just caught a break.

19
00:00:48,529 --> 00:00:51,407
All right. So that's one tuck
and one no-tuck.

20
00:00:51,569 --> 00:00:56,597
So that's when I said, " Hey, Kramer,
dude, you ever kill a man before?"

21
00:00:56,769 --> 00:00:58,566
You're on The Tonight Show. NBC.

22
00:00:58,729 --> 00:01:00,208
- Who else is on?
- I don't know.

23
00:01:00,369 --> 00:01:02,121
Corbin Bernsen.

24
00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:04,962
Do I have a case for you guys
to do on L.A. Law.

25
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:07,120
I don't wanna tell you
how to run the show-

26
00:01:07,289 --> 00:01:09,723
- No, of course not.
- It's enough with the bar already.

27
00:01:09,889 --> 00:01:14,121
He's a very handsome man.
Passionate, intense.

28
00:01:14,289 --> 00:01:15,881
But troubled, strange.

29
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:19,564
- Let's pick up this Kramer.
- Kramer!

30
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:22,197
Police have just released
a photo of the suspect...

31
00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:24,564
...being sought in connection
with the slayings.

32
00:01:24,729 --> 00:01:28,358
He is known only as Kramer.

33
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:31,000
There are many different jobs
in the police.

34
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:34,600
It seems to me
that "chalk outline guy"...

35
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:37,727
...is one of the better jobs
that you can get.

36
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:41,439
You know, it's not too dangerous.
The criminals are long gone.

37
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:43,088
That seems like a good one.

38
00:01:43,249 --> 00:01:46,559
I guess they're people that wanted
to be sketch artists...

39
00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:49,004
...but they couldn't draw too well.

40
00:01:49,169 --> 00:01:50,966
" Listen, Johnson,
forget the sketches.

41
00:01:51,129 --> 00:01:54,007
Do you think if we left the body
right there on the sidewalk...

42
00:01:54,169 --> 00:01:56,683
...you could manage to trace
around it?

43
00:01:56,849 --> 00:01:59,761
Could you do that?"

44
00:01:59,929 --> 00:02:01,965
How does that even help them
solve the crime?

45
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:04,518
They look at the thing.
" His arm was like that...

46
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:06,122
...when he hit the pavement.

47
00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:09,759
That means the killer must
have been Jim. "

48
00:02:14,929 --> 00:02:17,762
- He's on the loose.
- Let go of my arm. You'll get us killed.

49
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:20,727
What are we supposed to do?
What do you do in this situation?

50
00:02:20,889 --> 00:02:22,686
Should we call a lawyer
or the police?

51
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:26,637
Obviously, we're gonna call the police
and tell them he's not the guy.

52
00:02:27,249 --> 00:02:31,037
- We hope he's not the guy.
- Couldn't be the guy.

53
00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:34,925
God, I'm starved.
I'm weak with hunger.

54
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:37,649
How can you think of food
at a time like this?

55
00:02:37,809 --> 00:02:39,447
A time like what? I'm hungry.

56
00:02:39,609 --> 00:02:41,645
My stomach doesn't know
that Kramer's wanted.

57
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:43,880
I told you, you should
have had breakfast.

58
00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:46,847
I couldn't have breakfast.
It was lunchtime.

59
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:49,159
The three-hour time difference
threw me.

60
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:52,048
I wanted a tuna fish sandwich.
They wouldn't serve me one...

61
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:54,200
...because they were only
serving breakfast.

62
00:02:54,369 --> 00:02:58,123
- You should've had some eggs.
- For lunch? Who eats eggs for lunch?

63
00:02:58,289 --> 00:03:01,167
Have you ever heard of egg salad?

64
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:03,088
Why didn't you say something?

65
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:04,967
I gotta tell you about egg salad?

66
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:08,838
I need food, Jerry. I'm feeling faint.
I'm getting lightheaded.

67
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:11,045
I gotta call the police.
There's a pay phone.

68
00:03:11,449 --> 00:03:13,644
Pay phone in L.A.
Look, it's a miracle.

69
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,041
I have no change.
You got any change?

70
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:25,961
No, I don't. I never carry change.

71
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:28,404
- We need change. All I got is 20s.
- I have a 10.

72
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:30,366
- So break it.
- I hate asking for change.

73
00:03:30,529 --> 00:03:33,407
They make a face. It's like I'm asking
them to donate a kidney.

74
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:35,605
- So buy something.
- What?

75
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:38,363
I don't know.
Some mints or Tic Tacs.

76
00:03:38,529 --> 00:03:40,918
- Breath problem?
- No. I just want some change.

77
00:03:41,089 --> 00:03:42,841
- Tell me.
- Your breath is fine.

78
00:03:43,009 --> 00:03:44,681
It's delightful. It's delicious.

79
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:48,558
- You know, I haven't eaten anything.
- I just wanna call the police.

80
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:51,368
Why don't you just call 911?

81
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:53,964
- But is this an emergency?
- Of course it is.

82
00:03:54,129 --> 00:03:55,403
How is this an emergency?

83
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:58,437
Your friend has been accused
of being a serial killer.

84
00:03:58,609 --> 00:04:00,008
I think that qualifies.

85
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:03,522
All right, I'll call 911.

86
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:06,928
Do you think he did it?
Could he have done it?

87
00:04:07,089 --> 00:04:09,080
He couldn't have done it.
How could he have?

88
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,843
Couldn't do it. Could he?

89
00:04:12,009 --> 00:04:15,081
Hello, 911? How are you?

90
00:04:15,249 --> 00:04:16,887
I'm sorry. Just a reflex.

91
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:20,724
I know it's an emergency number.
It is an emergency.

92
00:04:20,889 --> 00:04:23,403
My friend's been accused
of being the Smog Strangler...

93
00:04:23,569 --> 00:04:25,400
...and I know he didn't do it.

94
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:28,357
They're putting me through
to the detective in charge.

95
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:29,803
Making terrific headway.

96
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:32,529
What is my name? Who am I?

97
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,567
I'm George Costanza.

98
00:04:35,769 --> 00:04:37,248
What's the matter?
Are you crazy?

99
00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:39,525
- Why are you using my name?
- Don't be a baby.

100
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:42,567
- What are you scared of?
- I'm scared of the same thing you are:

101
00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:44,845
Everything. Why don't you
use your own name?

102
00:04:45,009 --> 00:04:48,319
Your name is a good name. Costanza.
Sounds like it stands for something.

103
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:49,968
- They'll believe us.
- Really?

104
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:51,482
- Sure.
- You think so?

105
00:04:51,649 --> 00:04:52,968
Oh, yeah.

106
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:56,599
Yes, I have very important information
regarding the Smog Strangler.

107
00:04:57,089 --> 00:04:59,080
Get yourself a mint or something.

108
00:04:59,249 --> 00:05:00,841
Can I come in right now?

109
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,522
I suppose.

110
00:05:02,689 --> 00:05:05,408
Where are you located?
Where is that?

111
00:05:05,849 --> 00:05:08,124
I don't know where we are.
Where are we?

112
00:05:08,289 --> 00:05:09,927
- I don't know
- We don't know.

113
00:05:10,089 --> 00:05:12,045
He says, "Ask somebody. "
Ask that guy.

114
00:05:12,209 --> 00:05:14,086
- Excuse me, where are we?
- Earth.

115
00:05:14,369 --> 00:05:17,759
Hey, you know, I'm on the phone
with the police.

116
00:05:19,409 --> 00:05:22,560
Some guy just gave me
a wise answer.

117
00:05:23,649 --> 00:05:24,923
Ask that woman.

118
00:05:25,089 --> 00:05:27,319
- Excuse me, what street are we on?
- I don't know.

119
00:05:27,489 --> 00:05:28,888
- You don't know?
- I don't know.

120
00:05:29,049 --> 00:05:31,483
How could you not know
what street you're on?

121
00:05:31,649 --> 00:05:33,799
You don't know.

122
00:05:33,969 --> 00:05:39,327
George, it says here on the phone.
It's 12145 Ventura Boulevard.

123
00:05:39,649 --> 00:05:40,968
Okay.

124
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:43,324
Do we know where the 101 is?
No.

125
00:05:43,489 --> 00:05:45,798
Do we know where the 170 is?
No.

126
00:05:45,969 --> 00:05:48,039
Do we know where the 134 is?

127
00:05:48,569 --> 00:05:49,888
No.

128
00:05:51,489 --> 00:05:52,968
Okay.

129
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:56,679
He's gonna send a black and white
to pick us up.

130
00:05:56,849 --> 00:05:58,840
- Black and white?
- Cop car.

131
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:01,762
- Why didn't you just say that?
- I thought it sounded cool.

132
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:04,523
- Yeah, real cool. You're a cool guy.
- Oh, you are.

133
00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:06,919
I guarantee you Lupe's gonna tuck
your covers in.

134
00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:08,841
- I'll bet you. How much?
- Her tip.

135
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:11,079
- You got a bet.
- Okay.

136
00:06:11,249 --> 00:06:13,365
How much do you tip
a chambermaid?

137
00:06:13,529 --> 00:06:15,804
Which one of you is Costanza?

138
00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:17,881
Get in.

139
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,518
Hi. How are you?
Guys, listen...

140
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:26,602
...do either one of you have a mint,
or a piece of gum, or something?

141
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:40,722
Hey, Jerry, do me a favour.
Close your window.

142
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:45,281
Hey, get out of here.

143
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:50,443
- Hey, he's fooling around back here.
- Cut it out back there.

144
00:06:50,609 --> 00:06:52,361
- He started it.
- I did not.

145
00:06:52,529 --> 00:06:54,440
You guys gonna go through
some red lights?

146
00:06:54,609 --> 00:06:56,201
I don't think so.

147
00:06:56,369 --> 00:06:59,247
- But you could.
- Oh, yeah. Of course we could.

148
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:00,842
We could do anything we want.

149
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:03,728
We can drive on the wrong side
of the road.

150
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:07,199
We do that all the time. You should
see the looks on the people's faces.

151
00:07:07,489 --> 00:07:08,808
Shoot people.

152
00:07:08,969 --> 00:07:11,199
You guys ever shot anybody?

153
00:07:12,329 --> 00:07:14,445
- No.
- No.

154
00:07:14,609 --> 00:07:16,884
- Can I flip on the siren?
- Why bother them?

155
00:07:17,049 --> 00:07:19,722
I'm just asking.
All they have to do is say no.

156
00:07:21,129 --> 00:07:23,006
Yeah, go ahead.

157
00:07:25,049 --> 00:07:27,609
- Check it out.
- Can I try it?

158
00:07:27,769 --> 00:07:30,329
Yeah, go ahead. Hurry up.

159
00:07:31,249 --> 00:07:33,888
Scared the hell out of that guy.

160
00:07:34,289 --> 00:07:37,725
You know what I've never understood?
Why did they change the siren noise?

161
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:40,005
When I was a kid, it was always:

162
00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:42,848
You know, and now it's:

163
00:07:44,049 --> 00:07:46,119
Why'd they do that?
Did they do some research?

164
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:48,883
Did they find out "woo-woo"
is more effective than "waa"?

165
00:07:49,049 --> 00:07:51,438
Yeah, hey, what about those
English sirens, you know?

166
00:07:53,569 --> 00:07:55,241
Hey!

167
00:08:14,409 --> 00:08:16,240
I'm dizzy.

168
00:08:18,689 --> 00:08:21,647
- Nice shotgun.
- Thanks.

169
00:08:22,129 --> 00:08:24,882
- Clean as a whistle.
- You could eat off that shotgun.

170
00:08:25,049 --> 00:08:27,722
- What is that, a 12-gauge?
- Yeah.

171
00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:30,649
Twelve-gauge. Seems to be
the most popular gauge.

172
00:08:30,809 --> 00:08:33,403
- Big gauge. My favourite.
- Mine too. Love the 12-gauge.

173
00:08:33,569 --> 00:08:35,719
Makes the 11-gauge look
like a cap pistol.

174
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:37,800
- What do we got over there?
- What?

175
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:40,847
- I don't know.
- Looks like a possible 519.

176
00:08:41,009 --> 00:08:43,125
-519? What's a 519?
- Where?

177
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,803
- You think so?
- Looks like it.

178
00:08:45,969 --> 00:08:49,564
- I can't believe this. A 519?
- Where? Where? I can't see.

179
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:53,802
This is car 23. We have a possible
519 in progress. Over.

180
00:08:53,969 --> 00:08:56,199
All right. Let's pull over
and check it out.

181
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,927
Pull over?

182
00:08:58,089 --> 00:08:59,363
You can't pull over.

183
00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:01,485
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

184
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:04,766
Pull over? The lieutenant
is waiting to see us.

185
00:09:04,929 --> 00:09:07,807
- Hey, hey, hey. We're in a rush here!
- We have an appointment.

186
00:09:07,969 --> 00:09:09,925
What are you doing?

187
00:09:17,489 --> 00:09:18,968
Great.

188
00:09:20,609 --> 00:09:23,248
There's a bag of Pepperidge Farm
cookies up there.

189
00:09:23,409 --> 00:09:25,969
- What kind?
- Milano.

190
00:09:26,129 --> 00:09:29,804
Cops eating Milanos?
What kind of crazy town is this?

191
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:33,245
- Should I take some?
- I think that's a 519.

192
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:35,008
I'm starving.

193
00:09:35,889 --> 00:09:37,959
- Spread them.
- Hey, they're busting this guy.

194
00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:39,801
They're cuffing him.

195
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:45,317
I can't believe this.

196
00:09:51,969 --> 00:09:55,405
I can't believe that cops
still have to read...

197
00:09:55,569 --> 00:09:58,367
...that whole "you have the right
to remain silent" speech...

198
00:09:58,529 --> 00:10:00,042
...to every criminal they arrest.

199
00:10:00,209 --> 00:10:02,803
Is there anybody that doesn't
know that by now?

200
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:05,802
Can't they go, "You're under arrest.
You ever seen a Baretta?"

201
00:10:05,969 --> 00:10:08,324
"Yeah. " "Good. Get in the car. "

202
00:10:11,849 --> 00:10:13,202
Hi.

203
00:10:13,369 --> 00:10:14,643
Hi, I'm Jerry.

204
00:10:14,809 --> 00:10:17,084
George. How you doing?

205
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:19,048
What'd you do?

206
00:10:19,209 --> 00:10:20,688
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

207
00:10:20,849 --> 00:10:24,046
Oh, yeah, right. Me neither.
Hey, I didn't do nothing.

208
00:10:24,369 --> 00:10:26,246
Shut up.

209
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:30,719
- Hot out.
- Brutal.

210
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:37,719
What do you tip a chambermaid?

211
00:10:38,729 --> 00:10:40,845
I don't know. Five bucks a night.

212
00:10:41,129 --> 00:10:44,838
No. A dollar. Two, tops.

213
00:10:45,169 --> 00:10:48,127
Hey, you guys aren't cuffed.
What are you, narcs?

214
00:10:48,289 --> 00:10:51,281
- Narcs.
- Imagine. Us, narcs.

215
00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:54,919
No, no. No, actually, we're friends
of a serial killer.

216
00:10:55,089 --> 00:10:56,966
- Just trying to help him out.
- Really?

217
00:10:57,129 --> 00:10:58,528
- Yeah.
- That's very nice.

218
00:10:58,689 --> 00:11:01,157
- Thank you.
- Suspected serial killer.

219
00:11:01,329 --> 00:11:04,048
- He didn't actually do it.
- Yeah, well, we don't think.

220
00:11:04,209 --> 00:11:05,608
We're pretty sure.

221
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:10,244
- A dollar a night?
- Yeah. That's a good tip.

222
00:11:10,409 --> 00:11:13,003
- That stinks.
- I read it in Ann Landers.

223
00:11:13,169 --> 00:11:17,879
- Ann Landers sucks!
- Hey, shut up back there.

224
00:11:18,049 --> 00:11:21,325
Attention, al units. Attention, al units.
Al units, code three.

225
00:11:21,489 --> 00:11:23,559
Al units in the area,
code three in progress.

226
00:11:23,729 --> 00:11:28,439
1648 North Las Palmas. Units require
assistance in apprehension, 702.

227
00:11:28,609 --> 00:11:30,565
- That's the Smog Strangler.
- Kramer.

228
00:11:30,729 --> 00:11:32,048
- They got him.
- Let's go.

229
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:49,440
We've gotta go.
Let's see what's happening.

230
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:52,681
I don't know why I'm doing this.
Oh, man.

231
00:11:57,169 --> 00:11:59,160
Jerry. George.

232
00:11:59,329 --> 00:12:03,561
You're under arrest for first-degree
murder in the death of Chelsea Lange.

233
00:12:15,729 --> 00:12:20,200
Why'd you do it? Why'd you do it?
People wanna know, please!

234
00:12:20,369 --> 00:12:22,644
- What possessed you?
- Well, I don't know.

235
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:25,926
- Do you have any regrets?
- How are you?

236
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:35,368
Hey!

237
00:12:35,969 --> 00:12:37,641
Hey!

238
00:12:39,249 --> 00:12:44,323
- Hey, how you doing? Jerry! George!
- We're doing fine. How are you?

239
00:12:44,489 --> 00:12:47,401
What? Me? Fabulous.
Just fabulous.

240
00:12:47,569 --> 00:12:50,242
I got a lot of auditions,
a lot of callbacks.

241
00:12:50,409 --> 00:12:52,479
I got a lot of interest
in my movie treatment.

242
00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:55,561
You know, I'm in development.
I'm developing vehicles.

243
00:12:55,729 --> 00:12:59,438
Man, there's a lot of energy here, man.
You know, the vibe, it's powerful.

244
00:12:59,609 --> 00:13:02,726
I'm just swept up in it.
Yeah, I'm a player.

245
00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:05,642
- You're a player?
- Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm a player.

246
00:13:05,849 --> 00:13:08,522
Kramer, do you realize
what's going on here?

247
00:13:08,689 --> 00:13:10,566
Do you know why you're here?

248
00:13:12,289 --> 00:13:15,520
What, this? I'll be out of here
in a couple of hours.

249
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:18,448
Hey, guess who I met today.
Fred Savage.

250
00:13:18,609 --> 00:13:20,918
Oh, nice kid. A really good kid.

251
00:13:21,089 --> 00:13:23,762
You know, we're talking about
doing a project together.

252
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:27,001
Kramer, you've been arrested
as a serial killer.

253
00:13:28,049 --> 00:13:31,086
So? I'm innocent.

254
00:13:31,249 --> 00:13:34,366
I mean, you guys believe that
I'm innocent, don't you?

255
00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:37,248
Jerry? George?

256
00:13:37,409 --> 00:13:39,798
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah, sure.

257
00:13:39,969 --> 00:13:42,085
Kramer, let's go.
Lieutenant wants to see you.

258
00:13:42,249 --> 00:13:45,321
Yeah, okay, yeah. All right.
Look, I'll be out of here by noon.

259
00:13:45,489 --> 00:13:48,049
Hey, maybe we'll have lunch
together, huh?

260
00:13:51,889 --> 00:13:54,357
Hey, is it all right if I talk
to them again?

261
00:13:54,529 --> 00:13:56,360
Yeah, okay.

262
00:13:57,009 --> 00:14:03,164
Help me! Oh, God, help me! Get me
out of here! George, Jerry, get me out!

263
00:14:04,489 --> 00:14:05,763
Get me-!

264
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:08,727
I didn't kill anyone. I swear.
I swear to God!

265
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:11,323
Don't you ever swear
to my God, Kramer.

266
00:14:11,569 --> 00:14:15,039
My God protects the innocent
and punishes evil scum like you.

267
00:14:15,209 --> 00:14:17,325
- Have you got that?
- You're making a mistake.

268
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:20,367
No! You made a mistake, Kramer.

269
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:22,485
Sickies like you always do.

270
00:14:22,649 --> 00:14:25,641
The only difference is this time
you're gonna pay.

271
00:14:25,809 --> 00:14:27,686
You might beat the gas chamber,
Kramer.

272
00:14:27,849 --> 00:14:29,487
But as long as I've got a breath...

273
00:14:29,649 --> 00:14:31,685
...you will never see the light
of day again.

274
00:14:31,849 --> 00:14:34,841
Whoa, whoa, whoa! You got
the wrong man! It wasn't me!

275
00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:37,648
Yeah, right. Maybe it was one
of your other personalities.

276
00:14:37,809 --> 00:14:41,279
What? The wise guy, the little kid,
the bellhop, the ballplayer?

277
00:14:41,449 --> 00:14:44,202
Maybe the door-to-door vacuum
cleaner salesman, but not you.

278
00:14:44,369 --> 00:14:46,246
No, you wouldn't hurt a fly.

279
00:14:46,409 --> 00:14:48,718
You just couldn't help yourself,
could you, Kramer?

280
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:51,847
You saw a life, brimming brightly
with optimism and verve...

281
00:14:52,009 --> 00:14:54,842
- ... and you just had to snuff it out.
- Can I talk to somebody?

282
00:14:55,009 --> 00:14:57,967
- You're not letting me explain!
- I don't want your explanations.

283
00:14:58,329 --> 00:15:00,968
Sure, I bet you've got
a million of them.

284
00:15:01,449 --> 00:15:03,167
Maybe your mom didn't love
you enough.

285
00:15:03,329 --> 00:15:06,685
Maybe the teacher didn't call on you
when you had your hand raised.

286
00:15:06,849 --> 00:15:10,080
Maybe the pervert in the park
had a present in his pants, huh?

287
00:15:10,249 --> 00:15:11,887
Oh, I got another theory for you.

288
00:15:12,049 --> 00:15:13,323
- You're a weed.
- No.

289
00:15:13,489 --> 00:15:14,968
- Society's filled with them.
- No.

290
00:15:15,129 --> 00:15:17,768
You're choking the life out
of all the pretty flowers.

291
00:15:17,929 --> 00:15:19,567
You see something
young and pretty...

292
00:15:19,729 --> 00:15:22,243
...you just got to choke
the life out of it, don't you?

293
00:15:22,409 --> 00:15:24,969
You killed the pretty flowers,
didn't you, Kramer?

294
00:15:25,129 --> 00:15:27,359
You killed the pretty little flowers,
didn't you?

295
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:31,238
You dirty, filthy, stinking weed!
Didn't you?

296
00:15:31,409 --> 00:15:32,683
I...

297
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:37,841
Lieutenant, for you.

298
00:15:38,009 --> 00:15:41,046
Martel. Yeah.

299
00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:42,767
Yeah.

300
00:15:43,369 --> 00:15:44,768
Yeah.

301
00:15:45,289 --> 00:15:46,927
Yeah.

302
00:15:47,089 --> 00:15:49,922
- What is it, lieutenant?
- Let him go.

303
00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:52,398
- What? But, lieutenant-
- You heard me. Let him go.

304
00:15:52,569 --> 00:15:53,843
Get him out of here.

305
00:15:54,009 --> 00:15:56,807
They just found another body
up in Laurel Canyon.

306
00:15:56,969 --> 00:15:58,880
Go on, Kramer. Get out of my sight.

307
00:15:59,049 --> 00:16:00,880
How'd you know about
the guy in the park?

308
00:16:01,049 --> 00:16:02,528
I said, beat it.

309
00:16:10,249 --> 00:16:12,046
- What happened?
- Somebody got killed...

310
00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:14,120
- ... while they had me in custody.
- Really?

311
00:16:14,289 --> 00:16:17,918
- Hear that? Somebody else was killed.
- No kidding! Somebody else got killed?

312
00:16:18,089 --> 00:16:20,444
While he was in jail.
So you're free!

313
00:16:20,609 --> 00:16:25,444
Yes, I'm free because the murderer
struck again. Hey!

314
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,525
So, Kramer, what are you gonna do?

315
00:16:31,689 --> 00:16:34,203
Do? Do?

316
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:36,599
Hey, I'm doing what I do.

317
00:16:37,009 --> 00:16:39,079
You know, I've always done what I do.

318
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:41,001
I'm doing what I do.

319
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:44,844
The way I've always done it,
and the way I'll always do it.

320
00:16:45,169 --> 00:16:47,000
What the hell are you talking about?

321
00:16:47,249 --> 00:16:48,648
What do you want me to say?

322
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:51,004
Things haven't worked out
the way I've planned?

323
00:16:51,169 --> 00:16:54,286
That I'm struggling, barely able
to keep my head above water?

324
00:16:54,449 --> 00:16:56,917
That L.A.'s a cold place
even in the middle of summer.

325
00:16:57,089 --> 00:17:00,877
That it's a lonely place even when
you're stuck in traffic on the freeway?

326
00:17:01,049 --> 00:17:03,802
That I'm no better than
the screenwriter driving a cab...

327
00:17:03,969 --> 00:17:07,200
...the starlet turning tricks, the
producer in a house he can't afford?

328
00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:09,877
Is that what you want me to say?

329
00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:11,848
- I'd like to hear that.
- Yeah.

330
00:17:12,009 --> 00:17:14,318
Well, I'm not saying that.

331
00:17:14,489 --> 00:17:17,162
You know, things are going
pretty well for me here.

332
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:20,162
- I met a girl.
- Kramer, she was murdered.

333
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:24,288
Yeah, well, you know, I wasn't looking
for a long-term relationship.

334
00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:27,407
- I was on TV.
- As a suspect in a serial killing.

335
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:31,198
Okay, yeah, all right. You guys gotta
put a negative spin on everything.

336
00:17:31,369 --> 00:17:34,600
What do they put in this tuna?
Tastes like a dill. I think it's a dill.

337
00:17:34,769 --> 00:17:38,444
- So you're not coming back with us?
- No, I'm not ready, you know.

338
00:17:38,609 --> 00:17:40,884
I mean, things are starting
to happen for me.

339
00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:43,244
Taste this. Is this a dill?

340
00:17:45,889 --> 00:17:47,481
No, it's a tarragon.

341
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:50,561
Listen, Kramer, I'm sorry
about that whole fight we had...

342
00:17:50,729 --> 00:17:53,482
...about you having my apartment keys
and everything.

343
00:17:54,889 --> 00:17:56,800
All right.

344
00:17:56,969 --> 00:17:58,402
Okay, it's forgotten.

345
00:17:58,569 --> 00:18:00,207
- Tarragon?
- Yeah.

346
00:18:00,529 --> 00:18:02,360
Oh, you're crazy.

347
00:18:02,529 --> 00:18:04,247
- Take it easy, buddy.
- Yeah, okay.

348
00:18:04,409 --> 00:18:06,604
Yep, take care. Stay in touch.

349
00:18:06,769 --> 00:18:10,125
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
Come on, give me a hug, you guys.

350
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:13,326
Kramer, my sandwich.
You're crushing my sandwich.

351
00:18:43,729 --> 00:18:47,961
You know, it's so nice
when it happens good.

352
00:19:03,849 --> 00:19:06,727
- Mint?
- No, thanks.

353
00:19:07,449 --> 00:19:09,963
I gotta tell you.
I'm really disappointed in Lupe.

354
00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:12,928
It's been three days already.
Forget about Lupe.

355
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:16,367
Think she gets to take any of those
little bars of soap home?

356
00:19:16,529 --> 00:19:17,803
No, I don't.

357
00:19:18,969 --> 00:19:22,245
You'd think when they hand out the
checks, they'd throw in a few soaps.

358
00:19:22,409 --> 00:19:25,367
Yeah, maybe they should throw
in a couple of lamps too.

359
00:19:25,529 --> 00:19:28,965
I'll tell you, if I owned a company,
my employees would love me.

360
00:19:29,129 --> 00:19:32,087
They'd have huge pictures of me
on the walls and in their home.

361
00:19:32,249 --> 00:19:34,080
Like Lenin.

362
00:19:34,249 --> 00:19:36,763
How much did you wind up
tipping her?

363
00:19:36,929 --> 00:19:40,001
Oh, my God, I forgot.

364
00:19:40,169 --> 00:19:42,239
That's why communism didn't work.

365
00:19:43,889 --> 00:19:45,481
Hey!

366
00:19:52,249 --> 00:19:55,321
- Got any mustard? This is empty.
- Yeah, there's a new one in there.

367
00:19:55,489 --> 00:19:57,798
No, no. I don't like this one.
It's too yellow.

368
00:19:58,449 --> 00:19:59,928
- Did you know he was back?
- No.

369
00:20:00,089 --> 00:20:02,444
- Got any pickles?
- Help yourself.

370
00:20:02,609 --> 00:20:05,169
Yeah. All right.

371
00:20:05,529 --> 00:20:08,362
Kramer, what are you doing here?

372
00:20:08,889 --> 00:20:10,641
I'm getting something to eat.

373
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,242
Kramer.

374
00:20:13,329 --> 00:20:14,762
Here.

375
00:20:26,249 --> 00:20:29,082
Authorities disclosed the latest
Smog Stranglings suspect...

376
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:33,123
...was apprehended this week
on an unrelated charge...

377
00:20:33,289 --> 00:20:34,881
...but somehow managed to escape...

378
00:20:35,049 --> 00:20:37,847
...from the police car
in which he was being held.

379
00:20:38,009 --> 00:20:41,319
Tobias Lehigh Nagy,
who is also wanted...

380
00:20:41,489 --> 00:20:44,401
...in connection with unrelated
slayings in the Northwest...

381
00:20:44,569 --> 00:20:47,766
...is still at large,
his whereabouts unknown.

382
00:20:47,929 --> 00:20:51,001
He is described as 5'5", bald...

383
00:20:51,169 --> 00:20:54,718
...and reputedly
a very generous tipper.

384
00:20:54,929 --> 00:20:57,489
The thing about L.A. to me
that kind of threw me...

385
00:20:57,649 --> 00:21:00,482
...was when, you know, they have
the smog alerts out there.

386
00:21:00,649 --> 00:21:04,961
And they actually recommend
that people stay indoors...

387
00:21:05,129 --> 00:21:09,919
...during the smog alert.
Now, maybe I'm way off...

388
00:21:10,249 --> 00:21:11,682
...but don't you think-?

389
00:21:11,849 --> 00:21:14,522
Wouldn't you assume that the air
in the house...

390
00:21:14,689 --> 00:21:19,558
...pretty much comes from the air
in the city where the house is?

391
00:21:20,289 --> 00:21:22,041
What do they think?
We live in a jar...

392
00:21:22,209 --> 00:21:24,245
...with a couple of holes
punched in the top?

393
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:26,843
What the hell's going on out there?
It's very strange.

394
00:21:27,009 --> 00:21:30,240
Do you realize it is now possible
for parents to say to their children:

395
00:21:30,409 --> 00:21:33,958
"All right, kids, I want you in the house
and get some fresh air.

396
00:21:34,129 --> 00:21:37,485
Summer vacation.
Everybody indoors."
