1
00:00:02,529 --> 00:00:04,247
Here's what happened /ast week.

2
00:00:04,409 --> 00:00:07,481
George and I went up to NBC, and
we told them the idea for the series.

3
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:08,843
We're waiting to sign the contract.

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,807
- Jerry, I want you to sign that contract.
- We're gonna sign it.

5
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:13,960
In fact, George is out with
the woman from NBC right now.

6
00:00:14,169 --> 00:00:15,921
I'm afraid we're gonna
have to pass.

7
00:00:16,089 --> 00:00:19,001
- You're passing?
- Well, it's much too low.

8
00:00:19,169 --> 00:00:20,966
That's it for this piece of junk.
I've had it.

9
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:23,324
- Is it the one your parents gave you?
- It never works.

10
00:00:23,489 --> 00:00:25,445
- Where's that watch we bought you?
- It's at the jeweller.

11
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:27,008
I would like somebody to hit me.

12
00:00:27,169 --> 00:00:28,761
What's the matter
with this Davola guy?

13
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:30,157
He's after Jerry now.

14
00:00:30,369 --> 00:00:33,759
I never had a back problem until that
night I slept on the convertible sofa.

15
00:00:35,409 --> 00:00:38,082
Cuban cigars.
It's a present from my father.

16
00:00:38,249 --> 00:00:39,364
- Here you go.
- What, cigars?

17
00:00:39,529 --> 00:00:40,518
Yeah, Cubans.

18
00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:45,003
- What's wrong?
- The Velcro.

19
00:00:45,169 --> 00:00:47,808
I can't stand Velcro.
That tearing sound.

20
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:50,244
Now, listen to me. I'm negotiating.

21
00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:53,560
Negotiation.
This is what you do in business.

22
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:55,481
- Leave all my stuff here?
- Leave it.

23
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:57,401
Tell us about the trip.
How's Dr. Reston?

24
00:00:57,569 --> 00:00:59,082
He has this power over me, okay?

25
00:00:59,249 --> 00:01:02,605
He has this way of manipulating
every little word that I say.

26
00:01:02,769 --> 00:01:04,521
He's like a Svenjolly.

27
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:07,249
Tell this guy you're seeing somebody
else. That's the easiest way.

28
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:09,445
His name is Kramer.

29
00:01:09,609 --> 00:01:11,406
I want you to tell this young man
to give me a call.

30
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:13,964
My wallet's gone! My wallet's gone!

31
00:01:14,129 --> 00:01:15,118
Where did you get that watch?

32
00:01:15,449 --> 00:01:17,485
I found it in the garbage can.

33
00:01:17,649 --> 00:01:21,119
What kind of an idiot throws away
a perfectly good watch?

34
00:01:22,089 --> 00:01:25,479
It's an entire industry of bad gifts,
all those executive gifts.

35
00:01:27,009 --> 00:01:29,728
Any stupid, goofy, brass,
wood thing.

36
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:31,959
They put a piece of green felt
on the bottom.

37
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:36,123
"It's a golf, desk, tie
and stress organizer, Dad."

38
00:01:36,289 --> 00:01:39,361
Well, to me, nothing compares
with the paperweight as a bad gift.

39
00:01:39,529 --> 00:01:42,566
There's no better way than a
paperweight to express to someone...

40
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:45,880
...that, "I refuse to put any thought
into this at all."

41
00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:51,127
Where are these people working that
papers are blowing right off of desks?

42
00:01:51,289 --> 00:01:55,328
Are the desks screwed to the back of a
flatbed truck going down the highway?

43
00:01:55,489 --> 00:01:57,719
Are they typing in the crow's-nest
of a clipper ship?

44
00:01:57,889 --> 00:01:59,368
What do you need
a paperweight for?

45
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:07,119
I don't understand this jeweller,
Jimmy Sherman.

46
00:02:07,289 --> 00:02:11,441
He brings a watch, takes over a week
to fix it. He fixed yours in one day.

47
00:02:11,609 --> 00:02:13,964
Oh, you know these jewellers.
They're enigmas.

48
00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:16,643
They're mysteries wrapped
in a riddle.

49
00:02:18,249 --> 00:02:20,319
- She's very attractive.
- She's okay.

50
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:22,047
- Just okay?
- She's nice.

51
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:24,200
- She's better than nice.
- She's all right.

52
00:02:24,369 --> 00:02:26,360
- She's beautiful.
- She's not beautiful.

53
00:02:26,529 --> 00:02:29,043
- I think she's beautiful.
- So you ask her out.

54
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:30,767
- I'm not gonna ask her out.
- Why not?

55
00:02:30,929 --> 00:02:33,238
If you don't think she's beautiful,
something's wrong.

56
00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:35,320
She's pretty. She's not beautiful.

57
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,128
I should drop dead
if she's not beautiful.

58
00:02:38,289 --> 00:02:41,884
- I think that's a little extreme.
- She's all right.

59
00:02:42,049 --> 00:02:45,644
Two exact same watches.
He tells you a week and him a day.

60
00:02:45,809 --> 00:02:47,606
How could that be?

61
00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:49,441
Something's fishy about this.

62
00:02:50,929 --> 00:02:52,282
He said what?

63
00:02:52,449 --> 00:02:55,168
- "The hell with them."
- "The hell with them"?

64
00:02:55,729 --> 00:02:59,039
- Those were his exact words.
- Oh, boy.

65
00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:02,565
He said, "We've got 500 shows
to choose from.

66
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:07,484
Why should we give two guys with
no idea or experience more money?"

67
00:03:07,649 --> 00:03:09,560
He was pretty emphatic?

68
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:12,163
- He pounded on his desk.
- He pounded?

69
00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:14,604
I told you to take the offer.

70
00:03:14,769 --> 00:03:18,648
Look, I had nothing to do with this.
It wasn't my decision.

71
00:03:19,089 --> 00:03:22,126
It was Jerry. Jerry told me.
I'm the creative guy.

72
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:25,087
- He handles the business end.
- You said it was insulting.

73
00:03:25,249 --> 00:03:29,481
I was quoting him. Why would I be
insulted? I'm never insulted.

74
00:03:29,649 --> 00:03:33,005
You could call me "baldy,"dump soup
on my head. Nothing insults me.

75
00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:36,241
- Well, there's nothing I can do.
- Don't they make a counteroffer?

76
00:03:36,409 --> 00:03:39,799
How can he just cancel the deal?
What kind of a maniac is this guy?

77
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:43,166
- He just says no, and that's it?
- Yeah, that's the way Russell is.

78
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:46,162
- He doesn't like to play games.
- He has to play. He can't not play.

79
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:47,842
We're playing.

80
00:03:48,049 --> 00:03:50,085
I gotta see him.
How do I get in touch with him?

81
00:03:50,289 --> 00:03:53,008
- You'll have to wait till Monday.
- No. I can't wait till Monday.

82
00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:56,047
That's impossible. I gotta talk
to him now. Where does he live?

83
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:58,359
I can't give you his address.

84
00:03:58,929 --> 00:04:02,001
- Give me that address.
- Hey, give me that!

85
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:07,128
He just wants to talk to you.
I couldn't talk him out of it.

86
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:11,680
So you just tell him that you're my
boyfriend and that we're in love, okay?

87
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:13,965
- Can you do that?
- Yeah, I'm your boyfriend. Yeah.

88
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:17,326
- Okay.
- Have we been intimate?

89
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:21,079
Yeah. Yeah, we've been intimate.

90
00:04:21,249 --> 00:04:23,558
All right, how often do we do it?

91
00:04:24,689 --> 00:04:27,408
Kramer, how is that important?
Honestly, do you really think...

92
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:29,480
- ... he's going to ask-?
- He's a psychiatrist.

93
00:04:29,649 --> 00:04:31,685
They're interested in stuff like that.

94
00:04:32,329 --> 00:04:34,638
All right. All right. We do it...

95
00:04:35,329 --> 00:04:37,399
...five times a week, okay?

96
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:40,368
- Oh, baby.
- Oh, my...

97
00:04:41,249 --> 00:04:43,205
All right, listen.

98
00:04:43,369 --> 00:04:45,644
- Just tell me what you'll say.
- I know what to say.

99
00:04:45,809 --> 00:04:48,846
- No, but I would like to hear it.
- I don't wanna say it out loud.

100
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:52,479
It kills the spontaneity. You know,
Gleason, he never rehearsed.

101
00:04:52,929 --> 00:04:54,999
- Go ahead. Do it.
- Okay. You talk to him.

102
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,239
- I'll talk to him.
- Hey, how's your hair?

103
00:04:57,409 --> 00:04:59,206
Well, yeah, it's good.

104
00:04:59,369 --> 00:05:03,157
You're not the type who should be
playing with matches, seriously.

105
00:05:04,769 --> 00:05:07,727
Yes. Dr. Reston.

106
00:05:08,249 --> 00:05:09,602
Is he in?

107
00:05:09,769 --> 00:05:13,000
Well, this is Kramer,
and he's expecting my call.

108
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:26,919
- Is he?
- Yes, yes, Dr. Reston.

109
00:05:27,609 --> 00:05:29,122
Well, hello there.

110
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:32,520
- Well, I'm a good friend of Elaine's.
- No, no, not friends.

111
00:05:32,689 --> 00:05:37,160
We're actually- We're not friends.
We're much more than friends.

112
00:05:37,489 --> 00:05:41,846
And... I'm afraid
we have a bit of a problem.

113
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:45,081
Well, the point is doctor,
I'm very much in love with Elaine...

114
00:05:45,249 --> 00:05:49,322
...and she's very much in love
with me, and, well...

115
00:05:49,489 --> 00:05:53,118
...we would appreciate it if
you would cease and desist...

116
00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:56,042
...and allow us to pursue
our courtship unfettered.

117
00:05:56,689 --> 00:06:01,160
If not, I can assure you, doctor, that I
can make things unpleasant for you...

118
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:04,844
...and your staff, if you have one.

119
00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:09,480
Yes. Yeah, but the point that I-

120
00:06:11,809 --> 00:06:15,484
Well, no. Well, yeah, that's-
It's possible.

121
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:20,645
Well, I suppose I could, but I'd
have to shift a few things around.

122
00:06:21,209 --> 00:06:25,487
Wait. Hold on for a second, will you?
Go ahead. Yeah.

123
00:06:26,129 --> 00:06:27,482
All right.

124
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:31,683
Yeah. Yeah. Well, okay.
I look forward to it too.

125
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:34,121
Okay, so long.

126
00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:36,359
What happened? What did he say?
What's going on?

127
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:40,158
- Okay, he wants to get together.
- Get together?

128
00:06:40,329 --> 00:06:42,240
- Why?
- You know, he wants to talk.

129
00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:45,481
Why didn't you just say no?

130
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,519
That's interesting.

131
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:53,879
- Did you enjoy your croissant?
- It was different.

132
00:06:54,609 --> 00:06:56,839
- And how was yours?
- Oh, very good.

133
00:06:57,009 --> 00:06:59,364
Try our mousse.
It'll change your life expectancy.

134
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:02,438
No, thanks. Just the check.

135
00:07:05,649 --> 00:07:07,321
What's the matter with you?

136
00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:09,486
- What?
- Why didn't you didn't flirt?

137
00:07:09,649 --> 00:07:11,207
- Come on.
- She was flirting with you.

138
00:07:11,369 --> 00:07:13,405
- Why didn't you say something?
- What would I say?

139
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:16,402
- You just sat there.
- Well, you made me uncomfortable.

140
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:19,641
You're a comedian. Couldn't you
come up with something?

141
00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:23,047
- Where's the bathroom?
- In the back, on your right.

142
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:29,480
- Dad.
- Will you stop it. Jerry, let go.

143
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:31,765
- Jerry.
- Would you let me pay just once?

144
00:07:31,929 --> 00:07:34,682
- You're out of your mind.
- You don't even have a wallet.

145
00:07:34,849 --> 00:07:36,521
- Don't worry about it.
- What'll you do?

146
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,600
What's the difference?
We'll figure it out.

147
00:07:38,769 --> 00:07:41,727
- You're not paying.
- All right, fine. You figure it out.

148
00:07:41,889 --> 00:07:44,528
I'd be curious to know how you
pick up a check with no money.

149
00:07:44,689 --> 00:07:47,442
Because if this works, the whole
monetary system's obsolete.

150
00:07:47,609 --> 00:07:49,725
We're back to wampum.

151
00:07:50,089 --> 00:07:52,045
I'm going to the bathroom.

152
00:07:53,049 --> 00:07:55,768
How the hell am I gonna pay
for this?

153
00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:03,521
They give you some portion here,
huh?

154
00:08:04,929 --> 00:08:08,080
Uncle Leo, I hope I wasn't rude that
day I bumped into you on the street.

155
00:08:08,249 --> 00:08:11,525
- I really did have to get to a meeting.
- Oh, no, no, I understand.

156
00:08:11,689 --> 00:08:13,407
I got plenty of friends
in show business.

157
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:15,480
I know you're all very busy.

158
00:08:15,649 --> 00:08:18,163
So you found that watch
in a garbage can, huh?

159
00:08:18,329 --> 00:08:22,288
Yeah. In fact, it was right after
I ran into you.

160
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:25,278
You know, a friend of mine
has a watch just like that.

161
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:27,804
I'd love to replace it for him as a gift.

162
00:08:27,969 --> 00:08:30,802
Well, I haven't seen
too many like these.

163
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:33,039
Yeah, I know.

164
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:36,043
Maybe you wanna sell me that one?

165
00:08:36,209 --> 00:08:38,598
Oh, sure.

166
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:44,965
Hang on a second.
I got a little proposition for you.

167
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:49,958
There is a George Bonanza
to see you.

168
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:53,485
- Costanza. Costanza.
- George Costanza.

169
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:56,038
The guy who pitched the show
with stories about nothing.

170
00:08:56,209 --> 00:08:59,724
- Jerry Seinfeld's friend.
- Seinfeld friend.

171
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:02,005
He says call him Monday.

172
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:06,719
Mr. Dalrymple, I have to talk to you.
It's about the show.

173
00:09:06,929 --> 00:09:11,605
It was all a terrible misunderstanding.
Just five minutes of your time.

174
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:14,484
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Dalrymple.

175
00:09:15,489 --> 00:09:17,605
Very good, sir.

176
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:21,408
You don't understand.
I can't allow my son to pay for me.

177
00:09:21,569 --> 00:09:25,164
Look, as soon as I get back to Florida,
I promise you, I'll mail you a check.

178
00:09:25,329 --> 00:09:28,366
Why don't you just let him pay,
and then you can pay him back.

179
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:30,724
- No, no. He won't let me do that.
- Why don't you...

180
00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:33,119
...put the money in his pants
pocket unsuspectingly?

181
00:09:33,289 --> 00:09:36,520
- He could wash them.
- We are running a reputable business.

182
00:09:36,689 --> 00:09:39,647
Don't tell me about business.
I sold raincoats for 35 years.

183
00:09:39,809 --> 00:09:43,358
- But you did not give them away.
- You don't understand-

184
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:46,521
I cannot get involved with you
and your family.

185
00:09:46,689 --> 00:09:48,839
Okay, now, look. Don't take too long.

186
00:09:49,009 --> 00:09:51,125
Look at this building.
What is this?

187
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:53,007
I don't know. It's a building.

188
00:09:53,169 --> 00:09:55,729
- The doors are on a diagonal.
- So what?

189
00:09:56,209 --> 00:09:58,769
It's architecturally incorrect.

190
00:09:59,609 --> 00:10:01,520
Just go.

191
00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:10,362
Is this a bad time?
I hope I'm not disturbing anything.

192
00:10:10,529 --> 00:10:12,838
We were about to sit down to dinner.

193
00:10:17,169 --> 00:10:22,402
- This is Cynthia.
- Oh, hi. Hi. Nice to meet you.

194
00:10:23,409 --> 00:10:25,240
- What are you having? Veal?
- No.

195
00:10:25,809 --> 00:10:28,118
- Looks like veal.
- It's not veal.

196
00:10:29,169 --> 00:10:31,399
Well, it's a good-looking
piece of meat.

197
00:10:31,769 --> 00:10:34,044
Wow, this is some place.
A duplex, huh?

198
00:10:34,209 --> 00:10:36,928
Look, stairs in an apartment.
All my life I dreamed about...

199
00:10:37,089 --> 00:10:40,843
...having steps in an apartment.
Even one step. Sunken living room.

200
00:10:41,409 --> 00:10:43,877
Although one step is not
all that sunken.

201
00:10:45,129 --> 00:10:49,042
- Who gave you my address?
- No, that's a fair question. It is.

202
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:52,679
Jerry. Yeah. Jerry's a friend of mine.

203
00:10:53,129 --> 00:10:56,644
He gave it to me. Unbelievable
how many addresses this guy has.

204
00:10:56,809 --> 00:11:00,199
He's got Marlon Brando's. I could go
to Marlon Brando's house if I wanted.

205
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:05,318
Of course, I wouldn't. The guy is-
Obviously, the guy has his problems.

206
00:11:06,129 --> 00:11:07,960
So you wanna talk about the show?

207
00:11:08,129 --> 00:11:10,085
Well, you know,
it's really very funny.

208
00:11:10,249 --> 00:11:12,888
Because, you know what we
got here, really?

209
00:11:13,049 --> 00:11:15,404
We really just have a terrible
misunderstanding. See...

210
00:11:15,569 --> 00:11:18,845
...when I passed on the deal, I thought
that's what Jerry wanted me to say.

211
00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:22,684
- I misinterpreted.
- Russell, where's the TV Guide?

212
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:25,317
What time is it? 8:30. I'll tell you
what's on. You got...

213
00:11:25,489 --> 00:11:28,003
...Major Dad, B/ossom-
Very funny program.

214
00:11:28,169 --> 00:11:30,364
- B/ossom's on Monday.
- Are you sure?

215
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:33,407
Look who I'm talking to.
The president of NBC.

216
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:38,768
Mr. Costanza, it's too late anyway. I
made a deal with another writing team.

217
00:11:38,929 --> 00:11:41,887
All right, look.
We're people, you and me.

218
00:11:42,049 --> 00:11:44,483
Businessmen, colleagues, if I may.

219
00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:47,243
Let's not quibble.
We'll do it for the $13,000.

220
00:11:47,409 --> 00:11:49,969
Thirteen thousand, and I never
came up here. We never talked.

221
00:11:50,129 --> 00:11:52,438
You take good care.
It's nice seeing you again.

222
00:11:52,609 --> 00:11:54,759
- Nice meeting you. Cynthia, right?
- Now, look.

223
00:11:54,929 --> 00:11:57,363
These deals are already made.

224
00:11:57,529 --> 00:11:59,645
All right. Let me just say this.

225
00:12:00,049 --> 00:12:02,927
Ten thousand dollars. I'm going
below what you wanted to pay.

226
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:05,967
You're having your dinner. Have your
veal or whatever it is. Enjoy.

227
00:12:06,129 --> 00:12:08,245
- Mr. Costanza.
- All right. That's it.

228
00:12:08,409 --> 00:12:12,925
All right. Good, $8000.
Cynthia, again, nice meeting you.

229
00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:16,764
Have I commented on the shoes?
I love suede. It's so thick and rich.

230
00:12:16,929 --> 00:12:20,001
Do you ever rub it against the grain?

231
00:12:20,569 --> 00:12:23,402
Russell, can we eat?

232
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:28,768
- All right, 8000.
- You made Jerry very happy.

233
00:12:36,529 --> 00:12:39,089
Could I just use your bathroom
for a moment?

234
00:12:39,369 --> 00:12:44,045
All right, 200. That's as high as I can
go. I think you're being unreasonable.

235
00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:47,645
Jerry, I'd give you the watch.
It's not the money. I happen to like it.

236
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:50,881
Look, I happen to know how much
that watch costs. It's a $60 watch.

237
00:12:51,049 --> 00:12:53,483
You paid 40 to get it fixed.
That's $100.

238
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:57,722
- I'm offering you 200.
- I never seen a band like this.

239
00:12:57,889 --> 00:13:02,405
All right, 300. Plus 50 for the repair.
Three-fifty, that's it.

240
00:13:02,569 --> 00:13:04,287
Do you have it on you?

241
00:13:05,009 --> 00:13:06,761
Yeah, I think I do.

242
00:13:07,249 --> 00:13:10,207
This is unbelievable.

243
00:13:12,049 --> 00:13:14,119
What the hell is going on here?

244
00:13:20,249 --> 00:13:22,365
Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.

245
00:13:22,529 --> 00:13:24,520
- Thank you for coming in.
- Thank you.

246
00:13:24,689 --> 00:13:26,725
- Please sit down.
- Alrighty.

247
00:13:38,929 --> 00:13:41,523
Could I offer you something to drink?
Coffee, anything?

248
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:46,285
Okay, yeah. I'll have a...
Do you have a decaf cappuccino?

249
00:13:48,249 --> 00:13:50,365
I don't think we have that.

250
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:52,640
Well, that's a little strange.

251
00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:58,242
- Why does that surprise you?
- Well, it's a very popular drink.

252
00:13:58,689 --> 00:14:02,079
- This is an office.
- That's true.

253
00:14:02,769 --> 00:14:05,567
- But, you know, I can't help but think-
- So tell me, Mr. Kramer-

254
00:14:05,729 --> 00:14:07,082
Okay, sure.

255
00:14:07,729 --> 00:14:10,766
Tell me all about you and Elaine.

256
00:14:10,929 --> 00:14:13,363
Oh, alrighty...

257
00:14:15,969 --> 00:14:18,324
Well, what we have here,
doctor, is...

258
00:14:18,729 --> 00:14:22,085
- ... an extraordinary situation.
- Is it?

259
00:14:22,249 --> 00:14:24,001
Oh, you'd better believe it.

260
00:14:33,129 --> 00:14:35,518
You really have a terrible voice.

261
00:14:35,689 --> 00:14:37,680
Do I know you?

262
00:14:37,889 --> 00:14:40,801
- I don't think so.
- Because you really look familiar.

263
00:14:41,369 --> 00:14:44,008
Oh, well, maybe you've seen me.
My face is on...

264
00:14:44,489 --> 00:14:47,322
- ... Mount Rushmore.
- Yes, of course. That's it.

265
00:14:47,489 --> 00:14:50,686
I guess I'm just used to seeing
it on a much larger scale.

266
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:53,602
Oh, yeah, right.
I replaced Teddy Roosevelt.

267
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:55,168
Oh, really?

268
00:14:55,449 --> 00:14:58,885
Trustbuster. Bust this.

269
00:15:05,609 --> 00:15:08,043
You know, I never thought of it
like that before, doctor.

270
00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:11,599
- You are absolutely right.
- I'm glad we agree.

271
00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:14,164
Would you like a cigar?
They're Cubans.

272
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:16,320
- I'd love one.
- Yeah.

273
00:15:16,489 --> 00:15:20,846
I think Elaine is a wonderful woman.
You two will make a wonderful couple.

274
00:15:23,329 --> 00:15:25,081
If you ever feel...

275
00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:27,958
...you need to talk to someone...

276
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:30,599
...about anything,
you have my number.

277
00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:32,920
Well, that's very kind of you.

278
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:36,680
These are good, huh?

279
00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:49,923
I cannot believe I'm doing this.
I never meet people like this.

280
00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:54,162
- You're not a nut, are you?
- No, I don't think so.

281
00:15:58,049 --> 00:16:00,517
I can't believe I'm doing this.
I never do stuff like this.

282
00:16:00,689 --> 00:16:04,967
Really? I give my number to just about
every customer who comes in here.

283
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:07,406
- You don't seem that desperate.
- Oh, yeah.

284
00:16:07,569 --> 00:16:11,721
Actually I'm a little disappointed.
I kind of had my eye on Uncle Leo.

285
00:16:12,609 --> 00:16:15,123
Well, I'll give you a call,
and thanks for the fish.

286
00:16:15,289 --> 00:16:17,439
- You know why fish are so thin?
- Why?

287
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:19,565
They eat fish.

288
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:43,168
- Hey.
- What happened?

289
00:16:43,329 --> 00:16:45,285
- What took you so long?
- He's a terrific guy.

290
00:16:45,449 --> 00:16:47,724
What are you talking about?
What did he say?

291
00:16:47,889 --> 00:16:50,801
- We talked about a lot of things.
- You talked about a lot of things.

292
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:52,925
Well, did you talk about us?

293
00:16:54,169 --> 00:16:58,128
I'm in /ove. I just met her outside
in the street. Her name's E/aine.

294
00:16:58,289 --> 00:17:01,361
She is the most beautifu/
woman I have ever seen.

295
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:03,840
Did you say E/aine?

296
00:17:04,929 --> 00:17:08,046
How come with the psychiatrist,
every "the hour"is only 50 minutes?

297
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:11,042
What do they do with that
10 minutes that they have left?

298
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:14,485
Do they just sit there going,
"Boy, that guy was crazy.

299
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:18,884
I couldn't believe the things
he was saying. What a nut.

300
00:17:19,049 --> 00:17:21,802
Who's coming in next?
Oh, no, another headcase."

301
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:27,522
- You should've told me it didn't work.
- I know, I know.

302
00:17:27,689 --> 00:17:30,840
- You didn't have to throw it out.
- I was always late. It was frustrating.

303
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:32,840
I'm sorry. I really am.

304
00:17:33,009 --> 00:17:35,569
- That must be Leo.
- I would've taken you to the airport.

305
00:17:35,729 --> 00:17:37,924
- He has nothing to do.
- Neither do I.

306
00:17:38,289 --> 00:17:39,642
- Yeah?
- It's George.

307
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:41,481
Come on up. It's George.

308
00:17:41,649 --> 00:17:44,368
- Oh, George.
- Whatever happened with NBC?

309
00:17:44,809 --> 00:17:47,801
- George turned it down.
- He turned it down?

310
00:17:47,969 --> 00:17:50,278
- Why did he do that?
- Because of Ted Danson.

311
00:17:50,449 --> 00:17:54,044
- What does he have to do with it?
- Maybe he doesn't like Ted Danson.

312
00:17:54,209 --> 00:17:56,598
Who knows? Maybe we'll wind
up getting more money.

313
00:17:57,049 --> 00:17:59,199
- Hey.
- Hey, Georgie boy. How are you?

314
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,166
Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld.
How are you?

315
00:18:01,329 --> 00:18:03,479
What's the matter with you?

316
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:06,522
- What did I do?
- What about NBC? Hear anything?

317
00:18:06,689 --> 00:18:08,839
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I did.

318
00:18:09,529 --> 00:18:11,724
We got a deal.

319
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:16,881
You see, he had the right idea.
Hold out.

320
00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:19,085
That's how you get the big money,
huh, George?

321
00:18:19,249 --> 00:18:22,286
- Please, Morty.
- He knows how to talk to these people.

322
00:18:22,449 --> 00:18:24,679
No one's gonna take advantage
of Georgie.

323
00:18:25,009 --> 00:18:27,728
I'm just happy to be working
with your talented son...

324
00:18:27,889 --> 00:18:31,598
...who is not doing this for the money.
That is so refreshing.

325
00:18:31,769 --> 00:18:33,725
- So, what did we get?
- Eight thousand dollars.

326
00:18:33,889 --> 00:18:37,518
- Beautiful.
- That's for the two of us.

327
00:18:37,969 --> 00:18:41,405
- Four thousand apiece?
- Let me see if I understand this.

328
00:18:41,569 --> 00:18:45,448
In other words,
you held out for less money.

329
00:18:45,929 --> 00:18:49,365
- I was wrong. You were right.
- The basic idea of negotiation...

330
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:53,966
...as I understand it
is to get your price to go up.

331
00:18:54,729 --> 00:18:57,197
- You're smart. I'm dumb.
- This is how they negotiate...

332
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:59,883
...in the Bizarro World.

333
00:19:00,049 --> 00:19:02,040
That's gotta be Leo.

334
00:19:02,209 --> 00:19:04,040
- Yeah.
- It's Leo.

335
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:06,564
- All right, we're coming down.
- Let's get going.

336
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:10,278
Dad, before we go,
I got a little something for you.

337
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:12,519
- A present.
- A present?

338
00:19:14,849 --> 00:19:18,558
Hey, look at this, a wallet.
Exactly what I needed.

339
00:19:18,729 --> 00:19:20,606
- You see?
- Come on, you lost your wallet.

340
00:19:20,769 --> 00:19:23,602
- I figured I'd get you another.
- I hope you didn't spend too much.

341
00:19:23,769 --> 00:19:27,079
This is one of the most thoughtful
gifts anyone's ever given me.

342
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:30,924
- He's something, your son, isn't he?
- All right. Let's go.

343
00:19:31,089 --> 00:19:34,001
- You're a terrific kid.
- Yeah, he's something, isn't he?

344
00:19:34,169 --> 00:19:36,524
How can anybody not like you?

345
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:38,800
- You're very special.
- Yeah.

346
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,324
I'm good for about $4000.

347
00:19:42,089 --> 00:19:46,799
- Hey, let's go. It's 12:22.
- All right, Leo.

348
00:19:46,969 --> 00:19:49,767
- Hey, Uncle Leo. How you doing?
- Hi, hi. I got it.

349
00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:52,682
This is some beautiful parking spot
you've got here.

350
00:19:52,849 --> 00:19:54,760
- I hate to give it up.
- Yeah.

351
00:19:54,929 --> 00:19:56,726
Dad, you're sure you don't
need more money?

352
00:19:56,889 --> 00:19:59,119
- Jerry.
- All right, I'm just joking.

353
00:19:59,289 --> 00:20:00,802
Listen, have a nice trip.

354
00:20:00,969 --> 00:20:04,928
- Bye, Mrs. Seinfeld. Take care.
- Thanks again for the wallet.

355
00:20:05,089 --> 00:20:07,319
- Morty, always a pleasure.
- Yes.

356
00:20:07,489 --> 00:20:09,719
Take care, now. So long.

357
00:20:10,449 --> 00:20:14,328
- Yeah, like he'd take your money.
- He took it. I put $400 in the wallet.

358
00:20:14,489 --> 00:20:17,208
He lost all that cash. It was the
only way I could give it back.

359
00:20:17,369 --> 00:20:21,920
- Otherwise, he wouldn't accept it.
- I'd love to see the look on his face.

360
00:20:24,209 --> 00:20:26,165
- You believe this?
- What?

361
00:20:26,329 --> 00:20:28,399
- It's Velcro.
- You're kidding.

362
00:20:28,569 --> 00:20:32,323
Who needs this? Leo, let's go.

363
00:20:46,049 --> 00:20:50,281
The main difference between women's
and men's wallets is the photo section.

364
00:20:50,729 --> 00:20:54,404
True? Women carry with them a photo
of every person they've ever met...

365
00:20:54,569 --> 00:20:57,606
...every day in their whole life
since the beginning of time.

366
00:20:57,769 --> 00:20:59,885
Every picture's out of date.
You know what I mean?

367
00:21:00,049 --> 00:21:03,246
"Here's my cousin, 3 years old.
She's in the Marines now.

368
00:21:03,409 --> 00:21:07,004
This is my dog. He died during
the Johnson administration."

369
00:21:07,409 --> 00:21:09,798
You get stopped by a cop.
No license, no registration.

370
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:12,039
"Here's 56 people that know me."

371
00:21:12,969 --> 00:21:16,359
Cop goes, "Just wanted to make sure
you had some friends. Move it along.

372
00:21:16,929 --> 00:21:18,760
Routine pal check."
