1
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:07,541
I think people think of their office
as a stationery store with Danish.

2
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,826
You know what I mean?
You wanna get your pastry...

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,946
...your envelopes, your supplies...

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:14,943
...your toilet paper, six cups of coffee,
and you go home.

5
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:17,022
Why do people that work in offices...

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,227
...have pictures of their family
on their desk facing them?

7
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,426
Do they forget that they're married?

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,309
Do they go, "5:00. Time to hit the bars
and pick up hookers.

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,381
Hold it a second.

10
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,064
I got a wife and three kids.
I better get home.

11
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,549
I completely forgot."

12
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:41,740
- She hasn't told her father yet?
- We're supposed to tell him tonight.

13
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,822
- What do you mean, "we're"?
- Susan wants me to be there.

14
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,185
You're meeting the father
for the first time?

15
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:51,423
- Yeah.
- You'll make quite an impression...

16
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,058
...when you tell him how
you burned his cabin down.

17
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,580
I didn't burn it down. Kramer did.

18
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,947
I mean, the whole thing is ironic.
Think of it.

19
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:04,022
The guy's nice enough to give you
a box of very fine Cuban cigars-

20
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,589
- I know what happened.
- No, wait.

21
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,708
- Then you dump them off onto Kramer.
- I know.

22
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:12,863
Who proceeds to burn
the man's cabin down...

23
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:16,306
...with one of those
very same cigars.

24
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,025
It's very comical.

25
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,741
Maybe we shouldn't
start writing today.

26
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:23,104
I got a lot on my mind.

27
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:25,420
We've put this off long enough.
Today's the day.

28
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,467
I wonder how Susan's
father's gonna react.

29
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,860
What's the worst he can do?
So you burn a house down.

30
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,224
Come on.

31
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,102
Not even a house. It's like a cabin.

32
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,783
We could build a cabin like that.

33
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,510
Well, maybe not us,
but two men could.

34
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:40,738
BICs? What, did you get BICs?

35
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:42,741
What, you got a problem
with the pen, now?

36
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,628
I like a Rolling Writer.
They're smooth.

37
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,099
All right, let's just get to work.

38
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,700
NBC pilot. Seinfeld Project.

39
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:53,021
Act 1, Scene A.

40
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,829
So you're gonna sit there?

41
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:57,664
Let me explain to you...

42
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:00,344
...one of the key elements involved
in the writing process.

43
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,943
Because it may seem outwardly...

44
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:04,829
...that the pen and the paper
and the chair play a large role.

45
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:10,224
But they're all somewhat incidental
to the actual using of the brain.

46
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,303
Okay, so just- Just park yourself.

47
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,506
All right. Act 1, Scene A.

48
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:18,059
- Drink?
- No. No drink.

49
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:23,299
- All right. Here we go.
- Act 1, Scene A.

50
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,909
- Weren't you supposed to call Elaine?
- Yes.

51
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,902
Hi, is Elaine there?

52
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,583
Oh, hi, Sandra.

53
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,579
Yeah, I can hold.

54
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,345
Every time I call, I gotta chitchat
with her assistant for, like, 20 minutes.

55
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,626
Oh, hi, Sandra. Listen,
I'm at a pay phone.

56
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:51,746
There's a lot of people
waiting to use it.

57
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:54,629
I'll be off in a minute!

58
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,542
Yeah, could you put me through
to Elaine?

59
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,985
Okay, thanks.

60
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:02,018
Are you thinking of ideas?

61
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,062
Is there any way I can
get you directly?

62
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:07,586
Every time I call, Sandra bends
my ear for, like, 20 minutes.

63
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,944
So we're on for later?

64
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,220
Yeah, I'll come by after work.

65
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:14,109
Hey, I got a rubber-pencil thing
happening here.

66
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,539
I gotta go. I gotta go.

67
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,462
Sandra? Sandra?

68
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,029
Can you come here
for a second?

69
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,109
- Okay. Let's go.
- Here we go.

70
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,226
- You got it? Here we go.
- Yeah.

71
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,538
Okay, how about this:

72
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:30,066
I'm in my apartment.
You come in.

73
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,107
It's beautiful.

74
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,181
And what do I say?

75
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,341
Could you do me a favour?

76
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,989
When my friends call...

77
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,989
...could you not talk to them
for too long?

78
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,268
Why, did Jerry say something?

79
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,863
No. No.

80
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,258
He must've said something.

81
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,749
Oh, no, he didn't say anything.

82
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,263
- I can't work for you.
- Oh, God.

83
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:59,149
- I can't. I'm leaving.
- No, Sandra...

84
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,346
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I really am.

85
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:04,308
Listen, Jerry's under a lot
of pressure right now.

86
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:07,064
It's very hard being
a stand-up comedian.

87
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,949
Sometimes they don't laugh.

88
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,178
- All right, let's get going.
- All right, let's go to work.

89
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,578
- Let's go.
- Okay.

90
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:19,583
- Hey.
- We're in the middle of something.

91
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,218
- We're trying to do a little work here.
- Yeah, come on.

92
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,618
What's with you?

93
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,906
- No more golf.
- Why?

94
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,182
Remember I told you about the pro
at the Westchester Country Club...

95
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:32,148
...who's letting me play every time
I gave him those Cuban cigars?

96
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:35,029
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well, I lost them all in the fire!

97
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:42,543
Hey, George, maybe you can
ask Susan's father for some more.

98
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:43,904
What are you, crazy?

99
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:47,187
I can't ask the guy for more cigars
after you burned down his cabin.

100
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,181
What's one thing got to do
with another?

101
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,424
Kramer, please.

102
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,660
Well, I can't go back
to the public courses now.

103
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,139
I can't. I won't.

104
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,426
I mean, you know what that's like?
It's crowded.

105
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,706
The grass has
big brown patches in it.

106
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,189
They don't rake the sand traps.

107
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:05,183
Not to mention the calibre of people
you have to play with.

108
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,463
I can't help you. You're gonna have to
get them someplace else.

109
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,541
Where? They're Cubans.

110
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,824
- You know what? I should take off.
- What?

111
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:16,663
I gotta go to Susan's parents' house
for dinner.

112
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,424
I wanna shower first,
and I wanna leave plenty of time.

113
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,626
You got four hours.
What about the script?

114
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,708
I think we got a bite on it.

115
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,828
Doesn't George look like
your sister Sara?

116
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,702
A slight resemblance.

117
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,307
Her son's a podiatrist, you know.

118
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:43,709
Oh, I have tremendous respect
for people who work with feet.

119
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,589
I mean, to dedicate yourself
to the foot...

120
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:50,780
You're toiling in virtual anonymity.
I mean...

121
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,181
How are you enjoying those cigars
I gave you?

122
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,619
Oh, the cigars.

123
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:01,258
I'm sucking them down.

124
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,819
I'm puffing my brains out, yeah.

125
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,220
You know, those cigars
are made special for Castro.

126
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,181
I did not know that.

127
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,624
Weird. Wild.

128
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:15,545
- What?
- He's doing Johnny Carson, Daddy.

129
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,502
I didn't care much for his jokes.

130
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,468
- Daddy never laughs.
- Oh, well, so what?

131
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,541
Laughter. What is that?

132
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:27,100
I mean, what is the point
of opening your mouth and going:

133
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,068
What is that?

134
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,580
You know, you can't get
those cigars anywhere.

135
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,344
You and your cigars.

136
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,705
Wear some more lipstick.

137
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:45,547
Daddy, there's- There's something
that we have to talk to you about.

138
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,702
Oh, I forgot to ask you:
how'd you like the cabin?

139
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,505
Oh, the- The cabin.

140
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,262
Well...

141
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,348
After we get off the phone
you tell her?

142
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,421
Of course she knows it was me
who complained.

143
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,467
Now I'm responsible
for this woman quitting.

144
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,588
- Oh, this is unbelievable.
- I know.

145
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,389
I screwed up. It's all my fault.

146
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:11,348
- Would you call her?
- Oh, dial the number.

147
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,903
How could you do this?

148
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,981
I was just trying to help you.

149
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:20,869
Trying to help me.

150
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,468
Hello. Sandra.

151
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,188
Hi, this is Jerry Seinfeld.

152
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:28,706
Listen, I wanted to tell you there's
been a terrible misunderstanding.

153
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,588
See, I told Elaine...

154
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,742
...that it was a real treat
talking to you on the phone.

155
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:37,107
And she thought I was being sarcastic
because I'm a comedian, and all.

156
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:40,546
She thought, I think, "Yeah, it's a
real treat talking to her on the phone."

157
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,782
But I was really being sincere.

158
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,259
No, of course I like you.

159
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,382
Tonight?

160
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,019
Hold on a second.

161
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,385
- She wants to have a drink with me.
- Just go. Go.

162
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,188
- Oh, I don't-
- Go.

163
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,545
Yeah, I think I can.

164
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,908
Yeah, I know where that is.

165
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:05,506
Okay. I'll see you there.
Okay, bye.

166
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,581
Now I gotta have a drink with her.

167
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,502
The cabin.

168
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,663
Well...

169
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,940
Susan?

170
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,419
- About the cabin-
- I love that place.

171
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:21,026
My father built that cabin in 1947.

172
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:24,466
My mother was recuperating
from impetigo at the time...

173
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:28,305
...and Dad thought it would be a good
idea to get her out into the fresh air.

174
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,108
She died there the following winter.

175
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,180
And Dad passed away
10 years later to the day.

176
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,705
His last words to me were:

177
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,425
"Cherish the cabin."

178
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:48,226
Not, "Take care of your sister."
She's a paraplegic.

179
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,867
But, "Cherish the cabin."

180
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:56,067
And I have, for 45 years.

181
00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:00,349
It's often been a sanctuary for me.

182
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,750
Kind of like Superman's
Fortress of Solitude.

183
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,982
What?

184
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:07,909
Superman.

185
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:10,868
He built a Fortress of Solitude
up at the North Pole...

186
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:14,227
...to, you know, sort of
get away from it all.

187
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:17,748
When I go, I'm passing it on to her.

188
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:22,188
Well, I'll take a hotel any day.

189
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,669
- Daddy?
- Yes.

190
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,980
Daddy, about the cabin.

191
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:30,020
Look, Henry, I spilled wine on me.

192
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,943
- What about it?
- Well, the thing is...

193
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:36,386
- What? What is it?
- Well, the cabin is kind of...

194
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:39,110
- George?
- Burned.

195
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:43,305
- Burned?
- There was a fire, and it-

196
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,869
Burned.

197
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:49,379
- The cabin burned?
- Yeah, burned.

198
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:52,223
Burned?

199
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,539
Was anything found?

200
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:56,622
Was it all burned to the ground?
Did they find anything?

201
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:59,350
- No. Nothing.
- Nothing?

202
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:04,109
But, you know, Mr. Ross,
if you look at the whole situation...

203
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,738
...what with it being your cigars
and everything...

204
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,707
...it's really rather ironic.

205
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,828
One might even say,
in a sense, comical.

206
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:16,709
Really. Think about it.

207
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,338
- I can't believe you said that.
- What?

208
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,660
How could you say
something like that to me?

209
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,139
What? You were the one
who was talking dirty.

210
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,663
I was just trying to keep up.

211
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:29,379
- That was a weird thing to say.
- Why? It didn't mean anything.

212
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,984
I was trying to join in
so you wouldn't feel embarrassed.

213
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:36,143
- Oh, I think you're really sick.
- I'm not sick.

214
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:38,261
You said much sicker things
than me.

215
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,181
- I'm leaving.
- You're making too much of this.

216
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,499
Excuse me.

217
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,581
- Let me walk you to a cab.
- That's okay.

218
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,059
The main thing is that this is
just between us.

219
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,869
- And that'll be the end of it.
- Oh, really?

220
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:52,590
I mean, people, they're not interested
in things like this.

221
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,139
They don't wanna hear about it.
They really don't.

222
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,746
So we're drinking and talking.

223
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,185
And so she starts rubbing my leg.

224
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:06,148
Wow, what did you do?

225
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:08,619
Have you ever told a woman
to stop touching your leg?

226
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,065
- Yeah. Right.
- I know it's the wrong thing to do.

227
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:15,381
She works in Elaine's office.
But I can't get that hand off my leg.

228
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:18,781
I'm looking at the hand thinking,
"That hand should not be on my leg."

229
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:22,499
But I can't make my brain to get
my mouth to say the words:

230
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,069
"Would you mind?"

231
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,901
Yet women have no problem getting
the hand off. How do they do that?

232
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:30,459
I don't know. They're working
on a whole other level.

233
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:34,307
- All right, so go ahead.
- So then we go back to my apartment.

234
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,302
So we're fooling around there.

235
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,381
You know, it's getting
a little passionate.

236
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:43,587
And she starts with the dirty talking.

237
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,310
All right, all right. Hold on.

238
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:48,381
Time out.

239
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:53,824
- What did she say?
- You know. The usual.

240
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,901
No, I don't know.
How do I know the usual?

241
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:59,062
- Typical things.
- What's typical? Give me typical.

242
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,265
She says...

243
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,942
That's very dirty.

244
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:21,829
That's absolutely filthy.

245
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:24,060
And then she starts talking
about her panties.

246
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,818
I'm gonna need some water here.

247
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,828
So I said something.

248
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,503
Okay, what did you say?

249
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:34,548
Now, bear in mind,
I am just trying to keep up.

250
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,746
- Of course.
- Okay.

251
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:40,027
So she's talking about her panties.

252
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,021
So...

253
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,183
So I said:

254
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:47,342
"You mean, the panties your mother
laid out for you."

255
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:03,349
"The panties your mother
laid out for you"?

256
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,865
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

257
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,864
It just popped out.

258
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:12,067
- Well, how did she react?
- She flipped out. Just left.

259
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,583
Well, that's not offensive.

260
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,025
It's abnormal, but it's not offensive.

261
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:19,227
Look, the main thing is I don't want
Elaine to know about any of this.

262
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,028
I mean, especially the pantie remark.

263
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:23,988
I mean, it's embarrassing.
She'd never let me hear the end of it.

264
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,748
What if this girl says something?

265
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,423
She will. She's going back to work.

266
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:30,058
I talked her into it.
How stupid was that.

267
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,900
So Susan's father took that news
pretty hard, huh?

268
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,584
Yeah. He went into the bedroom
and started sobbing.

269
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,628
- Guess he didn't see the humour in it.
- Yeah.

270
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,265
- Let's go. We got a lot of work to do.
- All right.

271
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:45,546
- Big workday.
- That's right.

272
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:47,779
- Okay.
- Let's go.

273
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,144
- Right now.
- Let's do it.

274
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:50,948
- Okay.
- All right.

275
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:54,786
- What do you got?
- I got, you enter, you go, "Hi."

276
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,781
And I go, "Hello."

277
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:00,863
Now, we need something here.

278
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,422
- Oh, hey.
- Kramer! Hey!

279
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,865
- Buddy!
- You guys are working. I'll come back.

280
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,383
- No, no! Come on.
- No, no!

281
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,626
No, you guys should
get back to work.

282
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:12,179
- Don't leave. We're taking a break.
- Oh, yeah?

283
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:14,910
George, did you talk to that guy
about getting more cigars?

284
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,148
I told you. I'm not gonna do that.

285
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:19,380
Okay. Well...

286
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:22,747
I guess I'm just gonna have to
take matters into my own hands, huh?

287
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,389
All right. I'll see you guys.

288
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:27,462
Where are you going?
Don't run off like that.

289
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,828
Okay...

290
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:45,188
- I need to talk to someone.
- Well, what is this about?

291
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,818
Well, it's a very private matter,
but extremely urgent.

292
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,620
- Are you an American?
- Oh, yeah.

293
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,064
I see.

294
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,027
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

295
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,540
- Okay, let's get going.
- Let's get focused here.

296
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:04,225
Come on, now.
Come on, let's get it together.

297
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,624
- Yeah?
- It's Elaine.

298
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,542
Come on up.

299
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:13,147
All right, you know what
we should do?

300
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,346
We should go to the movies.

301
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,626
- Get away from the script for a while.
- We should.

302
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:21,146
I just have to go over to the Rosses'
and drop off Susan's sunglasses.

303
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:23,426
- Come with me?
- Yeah. Does she live with them?

304
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,784
No, no.

305
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:28,863
- Hey, nice going, Jerome Seinfeld.
- What?

306
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:32,223
I just got a message from Sandra.
She's coming back to work.

307
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,341
Well, then you've just gotta fire her.

308
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,865
Don't even think about it.
There's no two ways about it.

309
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:40,427
- Why, what happened? Did you talk?
- Talk? Did I talk? I-

310
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:43,309
You're darn right I talked to her.
We talked up a storm.

311
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,506
I've concluded,
from the basis of those talks...

312
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:48,059
...that this isn't anybody
you should be talking to.

313
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,460
- You really think I should fire her?
- Oh, yeah.

314
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:54,623
In fact, if George and I weren't
so busy working, I'd do it myself.

315
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,744
What is your name, señor?

316
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,104
Kramer.

317
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:12,182
So Señor Kramer,
what is this about?

318
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,547
- Cigars.
- Cigars?

319
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:18,425
- Cigars.
- What about cigars?

320
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,588
See, here, I-

321
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,866
I saved one of the cigar rings.

322
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:28,306
- You mean, one of these.
- Yeah, yeah. That's them.

323
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:32,099
Okay, so I'd like to buy
a couple of boxes of those from you.

324
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:35,421
You realize, of course,
these are illegal in your country.

325
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,828
Well, illegal, huh?

326
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:43,499
I like that jacket.

327
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,422
- Hi!
- Hi. How are you?

328
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:54,784
- Hey, Jerry.
- Hi.

329
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,542
I thought you guys were
working today.

330
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,868
- Just taking a little break.
- Yeah.

331
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:01,908
- Oh, here's your sunglasses.
- Oh, thanks. Come on in for a second.

332
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:05,267
This is my brother Ricky. He's home
from college for the weekend.

333
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,307
Hey, there, young fella.

334
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,267
- What's your major?
- I don't have one.

335
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,582
Well, you should always
consider podiatry.

336
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,463
Nothing wrong with the feet.

337
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,109
And this is my aunt, Sara.

338
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,222
He doesn't look like me.

339
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,980
Sara, what do you have
on your wheels?

340
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,947
Nothing. They're clean.

341
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,782
Ricky, did you wipe her wheels off?

342
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:29,226
- Yes.
- Well, they're filthy.

343
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:33,069
It's just a matter
of common courtesy.

344
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:37,985
You come in the house,
you wipe your wheels.

345
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,827
Excuse me.

346
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,544
Hello, Raymond.

347
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:44,905
The man from the insurance company
dropped this off.

348
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,664
Said it was the only thing left
from the remains of the fire.

349
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,661
Oh, thank you.

350
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:52,698
Wow, I've never seen this before.

351
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:54,098
Oh, they're letters.

352
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:56,586
- Here.
- Oh, sure.

353
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:01,666
From- From John Cheever!

354
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:06,349
"Dear Henry...

355
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:09,149
...last night with you was bliss.

356
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:11,187
I fear my...

357
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:15,745
...orgasm has left me a cripple.

358
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:19,300
I don't know how I shall ever
get back to work.

359
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:22,746
I love you madly, John.

360
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:26,148
P.S. Loved the cabin."

361
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,381
- Well, we really should be...
- Yeah, look at the time.

362
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:36,064
...heading out.
You know, it's a time...

363
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,788
The box!

364
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,429
My letters! Give me that!

365
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,144
Who told you to open it?

366
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,584
Who's John? Who's John?!

367
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,581
- I knew it.
- I wanna know who John is!

368
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,900
John Cheever? Dad!
You and John Cheever?

369
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:51,824
Yes. Yes, he was the most
wonderful person I've ever known.

370
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,302
And I loved him deeply.

371
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,018
In a way you could
never understand.

372
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:06,943
Well, we really should be
heading out.

373
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,066
Jerry hates to miss
the coming attractions.

374
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:11,221
- Yeah, and because of the time.
- Yeah.

375
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:14,427
Time is what he's indicating there.

376
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:18,185
Anyway, onward and upward.

377
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:22,339
- Here we go.
- Let's go.

378
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,829
- Come on, now.
- Right now.

379
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,821
- You and me. No fooling.
- You got it.

380
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:28,823
- All right, what do you got?
- I got, you come in, you say, "Hi."

381
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:31,265
And then I say, "Hello."

382
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:34,381
- All right. So we need something.
- Yeah.

383
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:37,949
How about this:
I say, "How's it going?"

384
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:41,908
"How's it going?"Beautiful.

385
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:44,825
- Come on. We were just on a roll now.
- All right.

386
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,742
- Did you get that line?
- "How's it going?"

387
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:49,663
- Did you write it down?
- I'm writing it."How's it going?"

388
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:52,062
- Real good!
- What?

389
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:55,427
You know how much money
you cost me today? $429.

390
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,979
- What? How?
- I got Sandra transferred...

391
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,822
...to another office upstairs, okay.

392
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,948
So she blabs to Lippman about
my long-distance calls to Europe!

393
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:06,307
- What calls?
- I made a friend when I was in Europe.

394
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:09,507
And we've been in touch,
and Sandra told Lippman!

395
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,906
Did she say anything else to you?

396
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,826
Anything else? What do you mean,
"anything else"?

397
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,702
So she just left the office...

398
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:19,589
...didn't say a word to you
about anything?

399
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:23,186
- Yeah.
- Beautiful.

400
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,908
Why is that beautiful?

401
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,503
Oh, no. Not beautiful.

402
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:29,262
It's $429!

403
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:31,261
Hey, look, I'm gonna pay for that.

404
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,864
- No, no.
- No, I insist.

405
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:36,180
I was the one that encouraged you
to fire her.

406
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,988
- The whole thing was all my-
- Okay.

407
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:39,663
Fault.

408
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,821
Do you smell smoke?

409
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:48,383
Oh, hey! Hey, Jer, I want you
to meet my new friends here.

410
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:51,269
This is Luis, Jorge and Umberto.

411
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:53,546
- Hey.
- How you doing? Nice to meet you.

412
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,349
Yeah, we're heading up
to Westchester. Gonna hit the links.

413
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:59,104
- Yeah.
- Hey, isn't that your...?

414
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:01,101
Oh, yeah. Okay. We're going.
All right.

415
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,144
Hey, what are you reading?

416
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:13,702
The Falconer, by John Cheever.
It's really excellent.

417
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,904
John Cheever. You ever read
any of his stuff?

418
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:20,426
Yeah, I'm familiar with
some of his writing. You know.

419
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:25,509
Look, we gotta get back to work.
We just had a big breakthrough.

420
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:27,422
- Okay. I'll leave you two alone.
- Okay.

421
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,739
Maybe I'll visit my mother.

422
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:33,347
She just bought me some new panties,
and they're all laid out for me.

423
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:49,339
There's this whole
talking-during-sex business.

424
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:51,102
I mean, what are we doing here?

425
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,942
The question is...

426
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:55,226
...does the talking really
improve the sex?

427
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,823
Or is the sex act now...

428
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:59,265
...just there to spice up
the conversation?

429
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:02,786
Eventually, I'm sure people will get
too lazy even for phone sex.

430
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:05,544
They'll start having
phone machine sex.

431
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:09,579
"Yeah, I want you really bad.
Just leave it on the tape."

432
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:13,908
Then, I guess, the phone company
will come out with sex-waiting.

433
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,867
That'll be the new thing.

434
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,986
"Yeah, hold on, honey.
I got another call.

435
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:19,378
Oh, hi, baby. One second.

436
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:22,269
Honey, I've gotta take this.

437
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:24,386
Yeah, I've got sex-waiting
on the other line...

438
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,586
...and I've got to take this."

439
