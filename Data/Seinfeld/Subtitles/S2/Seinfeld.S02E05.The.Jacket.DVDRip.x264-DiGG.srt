1
00:00:02,529 --> 00:00:04,485
I hate clothes, okay?

2
00:00:04,649 --> 00:00:05,968
I hate buying them.

3
00:00:06,129 --> 00:00:08,085
I hate picking them out of my closet.

4
00:00:08,249 --> 00:00:12,686
I can't stand every day trying to come
up with little outfits for myself.

5
00:00:12,849 --> 00:00:13,998
I think eventually...

6
00:00:15,529 --> 00:00:16,678
...fashion won't even exist.

7
00:00:16,849 --> 00:00:18,521
We'll all be wearing the same thing.

8
00:00:18,689 --> 00:00:21,328
Because any time I see a movie
or a TV show...

9
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:23,878
...where there's people
from the future...

10
00:00:24,049 --> 00:00:25,801
...they're all wearing the same thing.

11
00:00:25,969 --> 00:00:29,279
Somehow they decided,
"This is going to be our outfit."

12
00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:33,965
One-piece silver jumpsuit,
V- stripe and boots. That's it.

13
00:00:35,689 --> 00:00:38,283
We should come up with an outfit
for Earth. An Earth outfit.

14
00:00:38,449 --> 00:00:39,598
We should vote on it.

15
00:00:39,769 --> 00:00:43,000
Candidates propose
different outfits. No speeches.

16
00:00:43,169 --> 00:00:46,081
They walk out, twirl, walk off.

17
00:00:46,249 --> 00:00:50,447
We just sit in the audience and go,
"That was nice. I could wear that."

18
00:00:54,969 --> 00:00:59,042
- I think I've seen enough.
- I might have something in the back.

19
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:02,169
The back? They never find
anything in the back.

20
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:04,638
If they had anything good,
they'd put it in the front.

21
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:09,121
Why don't they open an entire store
for the back? Call it"Just Back."

22
00:01:09,449 --> 00:01:11,201
All back. No front.

23
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:14,167
You walk in the front,
you're immediately in the back.

24
00:01:15,129 --> 00:01:17,962
Look, Elaine. Tie carwash.

25
00:01:20,769 --> 00:01:24,318
- I just read that. That's terrific.
- Her father wrote that.

26
00:01:24,489 --> 00:01:26,719
- Alton Benes is your father?
- Yeah.

27
00:01:26,889 --> 00:01:28,641
I always felt he deserved
a wider audience.

28
00:01:28,809 --> 00:01:30,401
I'm not so sure he wants one.

29
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:34,168
Hey, don't forget Sunday, okay?

30
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:37,207
You and George are coming, right?
Hotel Westbury, 8:00.

31
00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:39,485
Yeah, I guess I'm coming. I mean...

32
00:01:39,769 --> 00:01:42,886
- What, you don't wanna go now?
- No, I'll go. I'm going.

33
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:44,767
No, Jerry, you have to.
I need a buffer.

34
00:01:44,929 --> 00:01:47,363
I haven't seen my father
in a while, and, you know, it's-

35
00:01:47,529 --> 00:01:51,841
I'm worried I won't be able talk to him.
He's such a great writer.

36
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:54,887
Frankly, I prefer
the company of nitwits.

37
00:01:56,609 --> 00:02:00,124
So that's why
we're not together anymore.

38
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:06,888
What is this?

39
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:08,721
This is beautiful.

40
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:10,561
These jackets never fit me right.

41
00:02:10,769 --> 00:02:12,168
Try it on.

42
00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:18,918
Wow.

43
00:02:19,089 --> 00:02:20,488
This is soft suede.

44
00:02:20,649 --> 00:02:25,120
This may be the most perfect jacket
I have ever put on.

45
00:02:25,289 --> 00:02:29,123
- How much is it?
- Oh, my God.

46
00:02:29,289 --> 00:02:30,688
Bad?

47
00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:32,919
- Very bad?
- You have no idea.

48
00:02:33,089 --> 00:02:34,727
- I have some idea.
- No idea.

49
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:36,959
- I've got a ballpark.
- There's no park...

50
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:38,642
...and the team has relocated.

51
00:02:38,809 --> 00:02:40,959
Let me see that.

52
00:02:41,609 --> 00:02:43,247
That is high.

53
00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:48,157
Oh, man, that is
a beautiful jacket, though.

54
00:02:48,929 --> 00:02:51,204
What's with the pink lining
with the candy stripes?

55
00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:53,605
It's just lining.
You can always have it changed.

56
00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:55,441
Should I get it?

57
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:58,607
I hate these moments. I'm hearing
the dual voices now, you know?

58
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:02,682
"What about the money?"
"What's money?"

59
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,965
It looks wonderful on you.

60
00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:24,803
- Hey.
- Hey.

61
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:26,557
New jacket.

62
00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:28,447
- What do you think?
- It's beautiful.

63
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:30,327
- Is it me?
- That's definitely you.

64
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:31,842
- Really?
- That's more you...

65
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:33,761
...than you've ever been.

66
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:40,480
- What is with the pink lining?
- I don't know. It's got a pink lining.

67
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:45,448
- So, what'd you pay for this?
- I paid what it costs.

68
00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:49,042
- How much?
- What's the difference?

69
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:51,564
- You're not gonna tell me?
- I'd rather not say out loud.

70
00:03:51,729 --> 00:03:52,957
It's embarrassing.

71
00:03:53,449 --> 00:03:55,679
- Over 300?
- Yes. But let's just stop it right there.

72
00:03:55,849 --> 00:03:58,079
- It's over 400.
- I'm really not answering anymore.

73
00:03:58,249 --> 00:03:59,841
- Is it over 400?
- Would you...?

74
00:04:04,689 --> 00:04:06,645
Whoa, Nelson.

75
00:04:08,169 --> 00:04:10,558
I know. I know.

76
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:16,129
What are you gonna do
with the leather one?

77
00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:18,082
I don't know.

78
00:04:22,569 --> 00:04:24,605
Are you gonna wear it?

79
00:04:27,289 --> 00:04:29,928
- I don't know, maybe.
- Well, you're not gonna wear this.

80
00:04:30,409 --> 00:04:32,479
Do you want it?

81
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:37,319
Yeah, okay, I'll take it.

82
00:04:40,609 --> 00:04:42,600
I like that jacket.

83
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:50,323
- Okay, take it.
- Hey. Good karma for you.

84
00:04:53,729 --> 00:04:55,799
Oh, baby.

85
00:05:10,049 --> 00:05:11,198
What is that song?

86
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:15,844
It's from Les Misérables.
I went to see it last week.

87
00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:19,524
I can't get it out of my head.
I just keep singing it over and over.

88
00:05:19,689 --> 00:05:21,919
It just comes out.
I have no control over it.

89
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:25,001
I'm singing it on elevators, buses.
Singing in front of clients.

90
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:27,205
It's taking over my life.

91
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:31,207
You know, Schumann
went mad from that.

92
00:05:31,689 --> 00:05:33,998
Artie Schumann
from Camp Hatchapee?

93
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:36,599
- No, you idiot.
- What are you, Bud Abbott?

94
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:38,760
What are you calling me an idiot for?

95
00:05:40,529 --> 00:05:42,963
You don't know Robert Schumann,
the composer?

96
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:46,398
Oh, Schumann. Of course.

97
00:05:46,609 --> 00:05:49,567
He went crazy from one note.
Couldn't get it out of his head.

98
00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:53,278
I think it was an A. He kept
repeating it over and over again.

99
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:55,360
He had to be institutionalised.

100
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:56,962
Really?

101
00:05:57,529 --> 00:05:59,440
Well, what if it doesn't stop?

102
00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:03,398
Oh, that I really needed to hear.
That helps a lot.

103
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:07,847
All right, just say something.
Just start talking. Change the subject.

104
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:09,920
Let's just go, all right?

105
00:06:10,249 --> 00:06:12,524
I can't believe we're having dinner
with Alton Benes.

106
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:14,202
I know exactly what's gonna happen.

107
00:06:14,369 --> 00:06:16,405
I'm gonna try and act
like I'm not impressed.

108
00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:18,764
- He'll see right through it.
- He'll look at us...

109
00:06:18,929 --> 00:06:21,124
...like he's backstage
at a puppet show.

110
00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:23,325
Let me just get my jacket.

111
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:39,120
This is huge.

112
00:06:39,289 --> 00:06:42,326
- When did this happen?
- Wednesday.

113
00:06:43,209 --> 00:06:46,406
This jacket has completely
changed my life.

114
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:49,447
When I leave the house in this...

115
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:51,566
...it's with a whole different confidence.

116
00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:54,880
Like, tonight I might've been
a little nervous, but inside this jacket...

117
00:06:55,049 --> 00:06:59,361
...I am composed, grounded, secure
that I can meet any social challenge.

118
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:01,528
Can I say one thing to you?

119
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:05,045
And I say this with an unblemished
record of staunch heterosexuality.

120
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:06,801
Absolutely.

121
00:07:07,929 --> 00:07:09,647
It's fabulous.

122
00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:13,883
- I know.
- And I'll tell you something else...

123
00:07:14,049 --> 00:07:15,846
...I'm not even gonna ask you.

124
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:17,601
I wanna know,
but I'm not gonna ask.

125
00:07:17,769 --> 00:07:20,329
You'll tell me
when you feel comfortable.

126
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:24,481
So, what was it, 400?

127
00:07:26,409 --> 00:07:28,798
Five hundred?
Did you pay 500 for this?

128
00:07:28,969 --> 00:07:34,089
Over 6? Can't be 7. Don't tell me
you paid $700 for this jacket.

129
00:07:34,249 --> 00:07:37,127
Did you pay $700 for this jacket?
Is that what you're saying to me?

130
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:40,804
You are sick! Is that what
you paid for this jacket?

131
00:07:40,969 --> 00:07:42,322
Over 700?!

132
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:45,318
What did you pay for this jacket?
I won't say anything.

133
00:07:45,489 --> 00:07:48,401
I wanna know what you paid
for this jacket.

134
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:52,960
Oh, my God! A thousand dollars?!
You paid $1000 for this jacket.

135
00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:55,085
All right. I'm walking out
of here right now...

136
00:07:55,249 --> 00:07:57,240
...thinking you paid $1000
for this jacket...

137
00:07:57,409 --> 00:07:59,240
...unless you tell me different.

138
00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:04,961
All right, I'll tell you what.

139
00:08:05,129 --> 00:08:09,042
If you don't say anything in five
seconds, I'll know it was over 1000.

140
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:11,681
Hey. Hey, will you do me a solid?

141
00:08:11,849 --> 00:08:14,317
- What kind of solid?
- Sit in the car for two minutes...

142
00:08:14,489 --> 00:08:16,957
...while it's double-parked.
I gotta pick up some birds.

143
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:19,006
- Birds?
- A friend of mine, he's a magician.

144
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:21,763
He's away on vacation. He asked me
to take care of his doves.

145
00:08:21,929 --> 00:08:24,966
- So take a cab.
- They won't take a cage full of birds.

146
00:08:25,609 --> 00:08:28,169
I can't. I'm on my way out.
There's no way I can do it.

147
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:33,800
- George, do me a solid. Two minutes.
- Well, I'm going with him.

148
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:37,086
I'd like to. I've never done
a solid before.

149
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:41,001
All right. I'll- Yeah. All right.
Have a good one.

150
00:08:43,569 --> 00:08:46,367
Two minutes. Believe me,
I know his two minutes.

151
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:50,807
By his conception of time,
his life will last over 2000 years.

152
00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:02,487
Schumann.

153
00:09:04,809 --> 00:09:06,481
Where are they?

154
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:08,480
Maybe he didn't show up.

155
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:10,765
What, you don't wanna do this?

156
00:09:10,929 --> 00:09:12,920
There's never been
an appointment in my life...

157
00:09:13,089 --> 00:09:14,966
...where I wanted the other guy
to show up.

158
00:09:22,489 --> 00:09:23,842
Wait a second. Is that him?

159
00:09:26,249 --> 00:09:28,080
Yeah. I think it is.

160
00:09:29,049 --> 00:09:30,562
Where's Elaine?

161
00:09:31,409 --> 00:09:33,240
I'm nervous.

162
00:09:34,569 --> 00:09:36,525
- Excuse me, Mr. Benes.
- Yeah.

163
00:09:36,689 --> 00:09:39,078
I'm Jerry, Elaine's friend.
This is George.

164
00:09:39,249 --> 00:09:40,967
It's a great thrill to meet you, sir.

165
00:09:46,049 --> 00:09:47,607
Sit down.

166
00:09:53,409 --> 00:09:55,479
- Want a drink?
- Sure.

167
00:09:56,169 --> 00:09:59,127
- What'll you have?
- Cranberry juice with two limes.

168
00:09:59,289 --> 00:10:01,598
And I'll have a club soda with no ice.

169
00:10:03,889 --> 00:10:06,562
I'll have another scotch
with plenty of ice.

170
00:10:07,449 --> 00:10:08,768
You like ice.

171
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:13,446
- I say, do you like ice?
- Like it?

172
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:16,567
Don't you find that you get more
without it?

173
00:10:20,009 --> 00:10:21,601
- Where's Elaine?
- Well, we thought...

174
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:23,361
...she was meeting you earlier.

175
00:10:23,529 --> 00:10:25,759
She's usually pretty punctual.

176
00:10:28,489 --> 00:10:30,207
Don't you find that, George?

177
00:10:30,369 --> 00:10:34,203
Yeah. Yeah, she's punctual, and...

178
00:10:34,369 --> 00:10:36,929
...she's been late sometimes.

179
00:10:37,089 --> 00:10:40,126
Yeah, yeah.
Sometimes she's on time...

180
00:10:40,289 --> 00:10:41,847
...and sometimes she's late.

181
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:44,247
I guess...

182
00:10:45,289 --> 00:10:47,041
...today she's late.

183
00:10:49,569 --> 00:10:51,207
It appears that way.

184
00:10:53,129 --> 00:10:54,687
- Yep.
- Yep.

185
00:10:56,969 --> 00:11:00,086
- Looks like rain.
- I know. I know. That's what they said.

186
00:11:00,249 --> 00:11:03,525
- Who said?
- The weather guy, Dr. Waldo.

187
00:11:04,489 --> 00:11:07,049
I don't need anybody to tell me
it's gonna rain.

188
00:11:07,409 --> 00:11:09,604
Oh, no. Of course not. I-

189
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:12,522
All I have to do is stick my head
out the window.

190
00:11:18,529 --> 00:11:20,565
Which one's supposed to be
the funny guy?

191
00:11:20,729 --> 00:11:23,687
- Oh, he's the comedian.
- I'm just a regular person.

192
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,568
No, no. He's just being modest.

193
00:11:26,929 --> 00:11:29,523
We had a funny guy
with us in Korea.

194
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,327
A tail gunner.

195
00:11:31,689 --> 00:11:34,487
They blew his brains out
all over the Pacific.

196
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:39,839
There's nothing funny about that.

197
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,643
Would you excuse me?
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

198
00:11:55,809 --> 00:11:57,288
I'll be right back.

199
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:16,967
I just wanted to tell you
that I really enjoyed Fair Game.

200
00:12:17,129 --> 00:12:18,801
I thought it was just brilliant.

201
00:12:19,209 --> 00:12:20,767
Drivel.

202
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:24,003
Yeah, maybe some parts.

203
00:12:24,169 --> 00:12:25,682
What parts?

204
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:28,881
The...

205
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:31,201
...drivel parts.

206
00:12:33,409 --> 00:12:36,685
Oh, my gosh. I just realized
I have to make a phone call.

207
00:12:36,849 --> 00:12:41,764
I can't believe... Would you-?
I'll be right back.

208
00:12:44,689 --> 00:12:47,442
Thank you for leaving me alone
with him.

209
00:12:47,609 --> 00:12:50,077
That was brutal.
I can't go back out there.

210
00:12:50,249 --> 00:12:52,763
- Well, let's just leave.
- Elaine will kill me.

211
00:12:52,929 --> 00:12:55,284
- Where is she?
- She's gotta be here soon.

212
00:12:55,449 --> 00:12:57,599
How could she leave us alone
with this lunatic?

213
00:12:58,009 --> 00:13:00,648
Ten more minutes, and that's it,
I'm leaving.

214
00:13:00,809 --> 00:13:02,720
I have to tell you,
this guy scares me.

215
00:13:02,929 --> 00:13:04,726
The waiter was trembling.

216
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:07,198
We can't possibly have dinner
with him alone.

217
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,758
- How we gonna get out of it?
- We say we're frightened...

218
00:13:09,929 --> 00:13:11,726
...and we have to go home.

219
00:13:13,609 --> 00:13:17,045
Yeah, that's good. He'd clunk
our heads together like Moe.

220
00:13:18,489 --> 00:13:21,322
I don't know. Just start scratching.

221
00:13:21,489 --> 00:13:24,208
Tell him you have the crabs.
He was in the military.

222
00:13:24,369 --> 00:13:26,166
He'll understand that.

223
00:13:28,129 --> 00:13:30,563
All fathers are intimidating.

224
00:13:30,729 --> 00:13:33,289
They're intimidating
because they are fathers.

225
00:13:33,449 --> 00:13:37,761
Once a man has children,
for the rest of his life his attitude is:

226
00:13:37,929 --> 00:13:41,239
"The hell with the world,
I can make my own people.

227
00:13:43,209 --> 00:13:45,598
I'll eat whatever I want.
I'll wear whatever I want...

228
00:13:45,769 --> 00:13:49,398
...and I'll create whoever I want."

229
00:13:57,129 --> 00:13:58,881
Who'd you call?

230
00:13:59,729 --> 00:14:05,281
My uncle is having an operation.
I just wanted to see how he was.

231
00:14:06,249 --> 00:14:08,205
What kind of an operation?

232
00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:11,121
Bone marrow.

233
00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:13,642
- Mr. Benes?
- Yeah.

234
00:14:13,809 --> 00:14:15,561
Message for you.

235
00:14:17,009 --> 00:14:18,727
From Elaine.

236
00:14:18,889 --> 00:14:20,447
She got tied up.

237
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,884
She'll be here in 30 minutes.

238
00:14:33,449 --> 00:14:37,237
Yeah, they should have taken care
of Castro when they had the chance.

239
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:40,481
Like we did in Guatemala in '53.

240
00:14:41,169 --> 00:14:43,842
- Well, Guatemala...
- Sure. Guatemala.

241
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:47,042
All right. You boys
get yourselves together.

242
00:14:47,209 --> 00:14:51,487
We'll head up to the restaurant.
I'll leave a note for Elaine.

243
00:14:52,329 --> 00:14:54,559
I'm going to the bathroom.

244
00:14:57,649 --> 00:14:59,002
- Let's go.
- What about Elaine?

245
00:14:59,169 --> 00:15:00,921
- Hell with Elaine.
- She'll be furious.

246
00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:02,807
We're dying here!

247
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:04,887
That's her. She's here.

248
00:15:05,569 --> 00:15:07,446
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Where is Dad?

249
00:15:07,609 --> 00:15:09,759
He's in the bathroom.

250
00:15:13,289 --> 00:15:14,961
Where have you been?

251
00:15:15,169 --> 00:15:17,444
Kramer. That Kramer.

252
00:15:17,609 --> 00:15:19,600
I'm just about to leave,
he calls me up.

253
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:21,919
He begs me to sit in his car
for two minutes...

254
00:15:22,249 --> 00:15:24,046
...so he can pick up these birds.

255
00:15:24,209 --> 00:15:25,403
Oh, you didn't.

256
00:15:25,569 --> 00:15:27,799
Well, he said he'd drive me here
right after.

257
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:30,802
So I am sitting in his car
for 20 minutes!

258
00:15:30,969 --> 00:15:33,529
He doesn't come down.
I am freezing.

259
00:15:33,689 --> 00:15:36,647
Then a cop comes by.
Tells me to get out of the car.

260
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:38,322
He's a city marshal.

261
00:15:38,489 --> 00:15:40,320
He's towing the car away.

262
00:15:40,489 --> 00:15:43,765
Kramer owes thousands of dollars
in back tickets.

263
00:15:44,289 --> 00:15:46,405
He was gonna tow it
with me in the car.

264
00:15:46,569 --> 00:15:49,322
So they tow the car.
Now I am standing outside...

265
00:15:49,489 --> 00:15:52,526
...and I am freezing, but I cannot leave
because I gotta tell him...

266
00:15:52,689 --> 00:15:53,883
...what happened to the car.

267
00:15:54,049 --> 00:15:58,122
So finally, finally, he comes down
with this giant cage filled with doves.

268
00:15:58,289 --> 00:16:01,599
He said he was getting instructions,
that each dove has a different diet.

269
00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:04,124
So we're wandering around,
trying to get a cab...

270
00:16:04,289 --> 00:16:06,439
...when two of these doves fly out.

271
00:16:06,609 --> 00:16:08,281
Now we're running after these doves.

272
00:16:08,449 --> 00:16:10,485
I almost got hit by a bus.

273
00:16:15,489 --> 00:16:17,207
So how is everything going
over here?

274
00:16:17,929 --> 00:16:20,284
- Great.
- Couldn't be better.

275
00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:24,442
Good, because Dad can make
some people a little uncomfortable.

276
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:27,203
- Oh, no.
- Get out of here.

277
00:16:27,929 --> 00:16:30,363
Man, Kramer. I could kill him.

278
00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:32,884
You know better than
to get involved with Kramer.

279
00:16:33,129 --> 00:16:36,121
- He said he'd give me a lift.
- The lift.

280
00:16:36,289 --> 00:16:40,077
Like the lure of the Siren's song.
Never what it seems to be.

281
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,717
Yet who among us can resist?

282
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:45,279
Where do you come up
with this stuff?

283
00:16:45,449 --> 00:16:47,644
- Well, look who's here.
- Oh, hi, Dad.

284
00:16:47,809 --> 00:16:48,958
Hello, dear.

285
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:51,723
- Who's the lipstick for?
- No one.

286
00:16:51,889 --> 00:16:53,641
- How's your mother?
- Fine.

287
00:16:54,169 --> 00:16:56,080
How about you, are you working?

288
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:58,717
Yeah. I'm reading manuscripts
for Pendant Publishing.

289
00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:00,322
I told you 10 times.

290
00:17:00,489 --> 00:17:03,049
Pendant? Those bastards.

291
00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:04,723
Well, all right, boys.

292
00:17:05,249 --> 00:17:08,002
We'll go to that Pakistani
restaurant on 46th Street.

293
00:17:08,409 --> 00:17:10,525
You're not afraid of a little spice,
are you?

294
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:20,964
Pipe down, chorus boy.

295
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:23,203
Chorus boy?

296
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:25,680
It's snowing.

297
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:27,123
It's beautiful.

298
00:17:27,649 --> 00:17:28,968
Snow?

299
00:17:30,129 --> 00:17:32,120
Snow, that can't be good for suede,
can it?

300
00:17:32,889 --> 00:17:34,402
I wouldn't think so.

301
00:17:34,569 --> 00:17:36,241
What should I do?

302
00:17:37,409 --> 00:17:39,365
We're taking a cab, aren't we?

303
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:41,997
Cab? It's only five blocks.

304
00:17:43,409 --> 00:17:46,685
- Why don't you turn it inside out?
- Inside out. Great.

305
00:17:55,169 --> 00:17:56,727
Wait a minute.

306
00:17:57,289 --> 00:18:00,804
- What the hell do you call this?
- I turned my jacket inside out.

307
00:18:01,489 --> 00:18:03,047
Well, you look like a damn fool.

308
00:18:04,569 --> 00:18:07,208
Well, it's a new suede jacket.

309
00:18:07,369 --> 00:18:08,563
It might get ruined.

310
00:18:08,849 --> 00:18:12,319
Well, you're not walking with me
and my daughter dressed like that.

311
00:18:12,489 --> 00:18:14,559
That's for damn sure.

312
00:18:15,689 --> 00:18:18,726
It's- It's only a few blocks.

313
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:29,277
- Elaine?
- Yeah.

314
00:18:29,449 --> 00:18:30,848
Come on up.

315
00:18:36,969 --> 00:18:38,197
- Hey.
- Hey.

316
00:18:38,369 --> 00:18:40,280
- I gotta feed the birds.
- So?

317
00:18:40,449 --> 00:18:42,679
You got any of those Mini Ritzes?

318
00:18:46,449 --> 00:18:48,440
I can't believe that I do.

319
00:18:51,289 --> 00:18:52,642
- What, are you going out?
- Yeah.

320
00:18:53,169 --> 00:18:55,160
Hey, where's your new jacket?

321
00:19:01,129 --> 00:19:05,680
- Oh, what'd you do to it?
- I was out in the snow last night.

322
00:19:06,569 --> 00:19:08,958
Don't you know
what that does to suede?

323
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:11,523
I have an idea.

324
00:19:12,769 --> 00:19:14,680
We can make the 9:30
at Cinema Three.

325
00:19:14,849 --> 00:19:16,282
Okay.

326
00:19:16,449 --> 00:19:18,041
Hello.

327
00:19:18,729 --> 00:19:21,562
Thanks again for coming last night.
Dad said he had a great time.

328
00:19:21,729 --> 00:19:24,926
- Is he still in town?
- He's driving back to Maryland tonight.

329
00:19:25,089 --> 00:19:27,478
So, what are you gonna do
with that one now?

330
00:19:27,649 --> 00:19:30,447
- I don't know.
- Well...

331
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:34,079
I didn't wanna tell you this,
but usually he hates everyone.

332
00:19:34,249 --> 00:19:35,682
Really?

333
00:19:37,129 --> 00:19:40,007
- You gonna throw this out?
- Well, I can't wear it.

334
00:19:40,169 --> 00:19:42,000
Yeah, he liked you, though.

335
00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:44,922
Said you reminded him
of somebody he knew in Korea.

336
00:19:46,969 --> 00:19:50,279
Well, if you're just gonna throw it out,
you know, I could take it.

337
00:19:50,449 --> 00:19:52,280
Yeah. Go ahead. Take it.

338
00:19:53,409 --> 00:19:55,764
Dad thinks George is gay.

339
00:19:57,449 --> 00:19:59,201
Oh, because of all the singing?

340
00:20:00,289 --> 00:20:02,723
No. He pretty much thinks
everyone is gay.

341
00:20:05,849 --> 00:20:07,123
See, I like it like this.

342
00:20:08,729 --> 00:20:10,321
Isn't that...?

343
00:20:15,129 --> 00:20:17,802
Is this from the snow last night?

344
00:20:19,049 --> 00:20:22,564
You know what you should have done?
You should have turned it inside out.

345
00:20:22,769 --> 00:20:25,044
I'll try and remember that.

346
00:20:26,289 --> 00:20:30,407
Boy, it's too bad
you gave me this one too.

347
00:20:31,649 --> 00:20:33,446
Yeah. Too bad.

348
00:20:35,129 --> 00:20:37,768
Gonna have to do something
about this lining.

349
00:20:51,129 --> 00:20:56,647
I had a leather jacket that got ruined.
Now, why does moisture ruin leather?

350
00:20:56,809 --> 00:20:58,162
I don't get this.

351
00:20:58,329 --> 00:21:01,924
Aren't cows outside
most of the time?

352
00:21:02,089 --> 00:21:05,126
I don't understand. When it's raining,
do cows go up to the farmhouse:

353
00:21:05,289 --> 00:21:07,883
"Let us in. We're all wearing leather!

354
00:21:08,329 --> 00:21:12,004
Open the door. We're gonna
ruin the whole outfit here."

355
00:21:12,169 --> 00:21:14,160
"Is it suede?"
"I am suede.

356
00:21:14,329 --> 00:21:18,561
The whole thing is suede. I can't
have this cleaned. It's all I got."

357
00:22:02,649 --> 00:22:04,640
