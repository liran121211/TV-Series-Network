1
00:00:02,449 --> 00:00:04,917
I'm on the street the other day,
make a pay phone call...

2
00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:07,319
...go overtime on the call...

3
00:00:07,489 --> 00:00:08,888
...hang up the phone, walk away.

4
00:00:10,369 --> 00:00:11,643
You've had this happen?
What-?

5
00:00:11,809 --> 00:00:15,404
Phone rings.
It's the phone company.

6
00:00:15,569 --> 00:00:17,480
They want more money.

7
00:00:17,849 --> 00:00:21,683
Don't you love this? And you've
got them right where you want them...

8
00:00:21,849 --> 00:00:24,283
...for the first time in your life.
You're on the street.

9
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:27,441
There's nothing they can do.
I like to let it ring a few times...

10
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:31,079
...you know, let her sweat
a little over there...

11
00:00:31,249 --> 00:00:34,002
...and then just pick it up.
"Yeah, hello, operator?

12
00:00:34,169 --> 00:00:36,000
Oh, I've got the money.

13
00:00:37,769 --> 00:00:39,919
I've got the money right here.

14
00:00:40,089 --> 00:00:41,727
You hear that?

15
00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:45,206
That's a quarter.

16
00:00:45,729 --> 00:00:47,162
Yeah, you want that, don't you?"

17
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:02,085
No, they just have to get more cops
on the force, it's as simple as that.

18
00:01:02,249 --> 00:01:03,887
Cops, I don't even care about cops.

19
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:05,641
I wanna see garbage men.

20
00:01:05,809 --> 00:01:07,640
It's much more important.
All I wanna see...

21
00:01:07,809 --> 00:01:10,562
...are garbage trucks, garbage cans
and garbage men.

22
00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:13,482
You're never gonna stop crime.
We should at least be clean.

23
00:01:13,649 --> 00:01:16,641
I tell you what they should do.
They should combine the two jobs.

24
00:01:16,809 --> 00:01:20,040
Make it one job. Coplgarbage man.

25
00:01:20,929 --> 00:01:24,604
I always see cops walking around
with nothing to do. Grab a broom.

26
00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:28,001
Start sweeping.
You sweep, sweep, sweep.

27
00:01:28,169 --> 00:01:30,967
Catch a criminal,
get right back to sweeping.

28
00:01:31,129 --> 00:01:34,644
- You should run for mayor.
- Nobody listens.

29
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,287
Where is someone? I'm starving.

30
00:01:37,449 --> 00:01:39,280
Think this is him right here.

31
00:01:39,449 --> 00:01:41,360
- Is there a table ready?
- How many?

32
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:44,204
- How many?
- Is Tatiana coming?

33
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:48,118
Well, I don't know. I have to call her,
tell her where we are.

34
00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:50,644
I'm very lucky she's even
considering seeing me at all.

35
00:01:50,889 --> 00:01:53,084
Really? I thought things
were going okay.

36
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:56,088
They were. It's kind of complicated.

37
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:57,682
Well, what is it?

38
00:01:59,449 --> 00:02:02,805
- How many?
- All right, four. Seinfeld.

39
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:04,238
Four.

40
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:06,286
That'll be five, 10 minutes.

41
00:02:10,969 --> 00:02:13,039
- What do you wanna do?
- Let's go someplace else.

42
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:15,484
- I am too hungry.
- We might as well just stay here.

43
00:02:15,649 --> 00:02:17,446
We haven't got much time
before the movie.

44
00:02:18,049 --> 00:02:21,166
I'm gonna call Tatiana.
There's the phone.

45
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:23,842
Tatiana.

46
00:02:24,009 --> 00:02:26,443
Excuse me. Are you gonna
be very long?

47
00:02:28,009 --> 00:02:29,203
Lasbrook, four.

48
00:02:29,369 --> 00:02:32,008
- So did I do a terrible thing?
- You mean lying to your uncle?

49
00:02:32,169 --> 00:02:34,160
I couldn't have dinner with him.

50
00:02:34,329 --> 00:02:35,887
Plan 9 from Outer Space.

51
00:02:36,049 --> 00:02:38,005
One night only. The big screen.

52
00:02:38,169 --> 00:02:40,160
My hands are tied.

53
00:02:40,729 --> 00:02:44,165
You know, it's a public phone.
You're not supposed to just chitchat.

54
00:02:44,609 --> 00:02:47,681
Jerry, get menus so when we sit down
we'll be able to order right away.

55
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:49,999
Can't look at a menu now,
I gotta be at the table.

56
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:51,648
He knows I'm waiting.

57
00:02:51,809 --> 00:02:54,403
He sees me.
He just doesn't wanna look.

58
00:02:54,649 --> 00:02:57,686
Everything's gotta be just so
all the time with you, doesn't it?

59
00:02:57,849 --> 00:03:00,044
I offered you those cookies
in my house.

60
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:05,329
Health cookies. I hate those
little dust-board fructose things.

61
00:03:06,009 --> 00:03:07,886
I just can't believe
the way people are.

62
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:11,678
What is it with humanity?
What kind of a world do we live in?

63
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:17,723
What?

64
00:03:18,089 --> 00:03:20,159
There's a woman over there
looks really familiar.

65
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:22,001
Dark hair, striped shirt.

66
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:23,397
I've never seen her before.

67
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:25,400
I know this woman.

68
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:28,242
This is gonna drive me crazy.

69
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:33,049
- Excuse me.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

70
00:03:34,649 --> 00:03:36,002
Did you see that? Those people-

71
00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:37,841
Look, they're getting a table.

72
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,408
Maybe they were here from before.

73
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:41,446
No, no, they weren't here before.

74
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:44,563
Are you gonna be much longer?

75
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:46,879
I have to make a very important call.

76
00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:55,478
Find out what's going on.

77
00:03:56,889 --> 00:03:58,527
Excuse me.

78
00:03:58,689 --> 00:04:01,044
Didn't those people just come in?

79
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:03,598
- I believe we were ahead of them.
- Yeah.

80
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:05,760
- What's your name?
- Seinfeld.

81
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:17,519
No, no. They were here before.

82
00:04:18,129 --> 00:04:20,404
Kackige, two.

83
00:04:22,849 --> 00:04:27,127
You ever notice how happy people are
when they finally get a table?

84
00:04:27,289 --> 00:04:30,804
They feel so special because
they've been chosen.

85
00:04:31,609 --> 00:04:33,042
It's enough to make you sick.

86
00:04:33,529 --> 00:04:36,168
Boy, you are really hungry.

87
00:04:38,969 --> 00:04:40,288
Hey.

88
00:04:50,329 --> 00:04:52,445
If anything happens here,
can I count on you?

89
00:04:53,369 --> 00:04:54,563
What?

90
00:04:55,369 --> 00:04:56,688
If we decide to go at it.

91
00:04:57,729 --> 00:05:00,368
Yeah, I wanna get into a rumble.

92
00:05:00,529 --> 00:05:03,282
I have to get in touch with Tatiana.

93
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:05,485
Look at his little outfit.

94
00:05:05,649 --> 00:05:08,925
It's all so coordinated.
The little socks match the little shirt.

95
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:10,920
I really hate this guy.

96
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:15,285
Oh, I'm gonna faint.

97
00:05:15,529 --> 00:05:17,167
George...

98
00:05:17,529 --> 00:05:19,759
...who is that woman
In the stripes?

99
00:05:20,369 --> 00:05:21,518
I don't know her.

100
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:23,600
She looks so familiar.

101
00:05:23,769 --> 00:05:26,488
It's not fair that people are seated
first come, first served.

102
00:05:26,649 --> 00:05:29,800
It should be based on
who's hungriest.

103
00:05:32,049 --> 00:05:34,358
I feel like walking over there
and taking some food...

104
00:05:34,529 --> 00:05:35,962
...off of somebody's plate.

105
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:37,687
I'll tell you what.

106
00:05:37,849 --> 00:05:40,079
There's 50 bucks in it for you
if you do it.

107
00:05:45,049 --> 00:05:46,402
What do you mean?

108
00:05:46,649 --> 00:05:48,480
You walk over to that table...

109
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:51,607
...you pick up an egg roll,
you don't say anything...

110
00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:55,120
...you eat it...

111
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:56,722
...say,"Thank you very much"...

112
00:05:57,489 --> 00:06:00,083
...wipe your mouth, walk away...

113
00:06:00,249 --> 00:06:01,841
...I give you 50 bucks.

114
00:06:03,849 --> 00:06:06,409
- What are they gonna do?
- They won't do anything. In fact...

115
00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:09,686
...you'll be giving them a story
to tell for the rest of their lives.

116
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:12,087
Fifty bucks?
You'll give me 50 bucks?

117
00:06:12,249 --> 00:06:13,398
Fifty bucks.

118
00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:15,287
That table over there.

119
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:16,723
The three couples.

120
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:20,359
Okay, I don't wanna go over there
and do it...

121
00:06:20,529 --> 00:06:23,760
...and then come back here and find
out there was some little loophole...

122
00:06:23,929 --> 00:06:26,568
...like I didn't put mustard on it
or something.

123
00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:28,959
No tricks.

124
00:06:29,649 --> 00:06:32,368
- Should I do it, George?
- For 50 bucks?

125
00:06:32,529 --> 00:06:35,441
I'd put my face in their soup
and blow.

126
00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:43,444
All right. All right.

127
00:06:43,609 --> 00:06:44,803
Here, hold this.

128
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:47,324
I'm doing it.

129
00:06:55,929 --> 00:06:58,807
I know this sounds crazy,
but the two men standing behind me...

130
00:06:58,969 --> 00:07:02,166
...will give me 50 bucks if I stand here
and eat one of your egg rolls.

131
00:07:04,129 --> 00:07:06,085
I'll give you 25 if you let me do it.

132
00:07:06,249 --> 00:07:08,240
- What?
- What is she talking about?

133
00:07:08,409 --> 00:07:10,320
What did she say?
What did she say?

134
00:07:10,489 --> 00:07:13,447
- Will someone tell me what she said?
- Twenty-five dollars?

135
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:18,120
- What happened?
- Did you see that?

136
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:20,325
- What were you telling them?
- I offered them 25.

137
00:07:20,489 --> 00:07:22,639
- They had no idea why.
- Oh, God.

138
00:07:23,129 --> 00:07:25,279
- George, the phone's free.
- Hallelujah.

139
00:07:28,809 --> 00:07:30,162
Excuse me. I was waiting here.

140
00:07:30,849 --> 00:07:33,488
- Where? I didn't see you.
- I've been here for 10 minutes.

141
00:07:33,649 --> 00:07:36,482
- I won't be long.
- That's not the point.

142
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:39,084
The point is I was here first.

143
00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:41,166
Well, if you were here first...

144
00:07:41,329 --> 00:07:43,081
...you'd be holding the phone.

145
00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:53,044
You know, we're living in a society!

146
00:07:53,369 --> 00:07:56,884
We're supposed to act
in a civilized way!

147
00:08:01,049 --> 00:08:03,404
Does she care? No.

148
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:06,606
Does anyone ever display
the slightest sensitivity...

149
00:08:06,769 --> 00:08:08,600
...over the problems
of a fellow individual?

150
00:08:08,769 --> 00:08:11,283
No. No! A resounding no.

151
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,838
- Hey, sorry I took so long.
- Oh, that's okay.

152
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:15,727
Really, don't worry about it.

153
00:08:17,209 --> 00:08:19,040
How do people fast?

154
00:08:19,209 --> 00:08:21,928
Did Gandhi get this crazy?

155
00:08:22,489 --> 00:08:25,049
I'm gonna go walk around
and see what dishes look good.

156
00:08:25,289 --> 00:08:27,849
I told my uncle I had a stomachache.
Think he bought that?

157
00:08:28,929 --> 00:08:31,523
Yeah, he probably bought it.

158
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:33,680
So, what happened with Tatiana?

159
00:08:34,129 --> 00:08:37,007
- I shouldn't even tell you.
- Come on.

160
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:39,603
After dinner last week,
she invites me to her apartment.

161
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,248
I'm with you.

162
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:45,881
Well, it's this little place
with this little bathroom.

163
00:08:46,049 --> 00:08:48,961
And it's, like, right there, you know?
It's not even...

164
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:51,597
...down a little hall or off in an alcove,
you understand?

165
00:08:51,769 --> 00:08:53,202
There's no...

166
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:54,643
...buffer zone.

167
00:08:57,089 --> 00:08:58,488
So...

168
00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:00,719
...we start to fool around...

169
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:04,564
...and it's the first time,
and it's early in the going...

170
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:08,639
...and I begin to perceive
this impending...

171
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,768
...intestinal requirement...

172
00:09:12,409 --> 00:09:15,321
...whose needs are going to surpass,
by great lengths...

173
00:09:15,489 --> 00:09:17,207
...anything in the sexual realm.

174
00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:20,719
So I know I'm gonna have to stop.

175
00:09:21,369 --> 00:09:25,521
And as this is happening, I'm thinking
even if I can somehow manage...

176
00:09:25,689 --> 00:09:27,122
...to momentarily...

177
00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:31,561
...extricate myself
from the proceedings...

178
00:09:31,809 --> 00:09:36,041
...and relieve this
unstoppable force...

179
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:38,643
...I know that that bathroom
is not gonna provide me...

180
00:09:38,809 --> 00:09:41,323
...with the privacy that I know
I'm going to need.

181
00:09:41,929 --> 00:09:44,204
This could only happen to you.

182
00:09:45,049 --> 00:09:46,323
So...

183
00:09:46,489 --> 00:09:49,367
...I finally stop and say:

184
00:09:50,929 --> 00:09:54,046
"Tatiana, I hope you don't take this
the wrong way...

185
00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:56,040
...but I think it would be best
if I left."

186
00:09:57,689 --> 00:10:00,044
You said this to her after?

187
00:10:00,849 --> 00:10:02,248
No.

188
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,043
During.

189
00:10:05,209 --> 00:10:06,483
- Oh, boy.
- Yeah.

190
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:08,082
Wow. So?

191
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:11,803
So I'm dressing,
and she's staring up at me...

192
00:10:11,969 --> 00:10:16,008
...struggling to compute this
unprecedented turn of events.

193
00:10:16,409 --> 00:10:18,127
I don't know what to say
to reassure her.

194
00:10:18,289 --> 00:10:20,564
And worst of all, I don't have
the time to say it.

195
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:24,284
The only excuse she might
possibly have accepted...

196
00:10:24,449 --> 00:10:27,600
...is if I told her I am,
in reality, Batman.

197
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:31,608
And I'm very sorry,
I just saw the Bat Signal.

198
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:36,925
It took me three days of phone calls
to get her to agree to see me again.

199
00:10:37,129 --> 00:10:41,008
Now she's waiting for me to call,
and she's still on the phone.

200
00:10:42,289 --> 00:10:44,200
I hate this place.

201
00:10:44,369 --> 00:10:47,964
I don't know why we came here.
I am never coming back here again.

202
00:10:48,129 --> 00:10:49,357
Who is that woman?

203
00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:54,557
Remember when you first went
out to eat with your parents?

204
00:10:54,969 --> 00:10:58,120
Remember?
It was such a treat to go.

205
00:10:58,289 --> 00:11:01,998
And they serve you this different food
that you never saw before.

206
00:11:02,369 --> 00:11:03,848
And they put it in front of you...

207
00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:07,763
...and it was such a delicious
and exciting adventure.

208
00:11:08,729 --> 00:11:11,766
And now I just feel
like a big sweaty hog...

209
00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:14,397
...waiting for them
to fill up the trough.

210
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,284
Oh, she's off.

211
00:11:20,249 --> 00:11:23,161
- Jerry, talk to that guy again.
- What am I gonna say?

212
00:11:23,329 --> 00:11:26,241
Tell him we wanna catch a movie
and that we're late.

213
00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:31,723
Hey. What stinks in here?

214
00:11:33,049 --> 00:11:36,246
Mr. Cohen, haven't seen you
for a couple of weeks.

215
00:11:36,409 --> 00:11:38,764
Well, I've been looking
for a better place.

216
00:11:38,929 --> 00:11:42,046
Better place! Want a-?
Want a table?

217
00:11:42,209 --> 00:11:45,167
No, just bring me a plate,
and I'll eat here.

218
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:48,844
Bring him a plate.
He'll eat here.

219
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:50,806
Come on, I'll give you a table.

220
00:11:53,809 --> 00:11:54,958
Excuse me.

221
00:11:56,769 --> 00:11:58,043
We've been waiting here.

222
00:11:58,209 --> 00:12:01,519
Now, I know we were ahead
of that guy. He just came in.

223
00:12:02,169 --> 00:12:04,637
Oh, no.
Mr. Cohen always here.

224
00:12:05,849 --> 00:12:08,841
He's always here? What does
that mean? What does that mean?

225
00:12:09,849 --> 00:12:12,124
Mr. Cohen, very nice man.

226
00:12:12,289 --> 00:12:14,245
He live on Park Avenue.

227
00:12:16,729 --> 00:12:18,765
Where am I?

228
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:21,800
Is this a dream?

229
00:12:22,489 --> 00:12:25,401
What in God's name
is going on here?

230
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:27,921
She's not there. She left.

231
00:12:28,089 --> 00:12:31,399
She must have waited and left,
because those people wouldn't get off.

232
00:12:31,649 --> 00:12:34,322
- Did you leave a message?
- Yeah, I told her to call me here...

233
00:12:34,489 --> 00:12:36,081
...and to tell anyone that answers...

234
00:12:36,249 --> 00:12:39,286
...to ask for a balding,
stocky man with glasses.

235
00:12:39,449 --> 00:12:41,804
I better tell them
I'm expecting a call.

236
00:12:42,969 --> 00:12:47,042
- Jerry, here comes that woman.
- Where do I know her?

237
00:12:48,689 --> 00:12:51,886
- Hi, Jerry.
- Hey.

238
00:12:54,809 --> 00:12:56,242
How are you doing?

239
00:12:56,409 --> 00:13:00,288
- How is everything?
- Good, good.

240
00:13:02,409 --> 00:13:03,683
What's going on?

241
00:13:04,569 --> 00:13:06,446
I'm working hard. And you?

242
00:13:06,929 --> 00:13:10,001
Oh, you know, working around.

243
00:13:10,169 --> 00:13:12,046
Same stuff.

244
00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:13,757
Doing...

245
00:13:13,929 --> 00:13:15,647
...whatever.

246
00:13:16,849 --> 00:13:21,764
- You haven't been around in a while.
- I know. I know. Well...

247
00:13:21,929 --> 00:13:23,726
...you know.

248
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:25,757
You should come by.

249
00:13:26,249 --> 00:13:28,922
Definitely. I plan to.

250
00:13:29,089 --> 00:13:31,239
I'm not just saying that.

251
00:13:33,249 --> 00:13:36,525
- Hi. I'm Elaine.
- Oh, Lorraine Catalano.

252
00:13:37,489 --> 00:13:41,402
I'm sorry. Lorraine, this is Elaine.

253
00:13:48,569 --> 00:13:51,129
Well, it was nice seeing you, Jerry.
And nice meeting you.

254
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:54,599
Oh, nice to meet you too, Lorraine.

255
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:57,683
Oh, my God, Lorraine.

256
00:13:57,849 --> 00:13:59,965
That's Lorraine from
my uncle's office.

257
00:14:00,129 --> 00:14:02,165
I am in big, big trouble.

258
00:14:02,329 --> 00:14:05,799
- The one you broke the plans with?
- Yeah, she works in his office.

259
00:14:05,969 --> 00:14:07,607
Now she's gonna see him
tomorrow...

260
00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:09,964
...and tell him she saw me
here tonight.

261
00:14:10,129 --> 00:14:12,723
He's gonna tell his wife.
His wife's gonna call my mother.

262
00:14:14,129 --> 00:14:16,689
Oh, this is bad. You don't know.

263
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:20,518
The chain reaction of calls
this is gonna set off.

264
00:14:20,689 --> 00:14:25,285
New York, Long Island, Florida.
It's like the Bermuda Triangle.

265
00:14:25,569 --> 00:14:27,719
Unfortunately,
nobody ever disappears.

266
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,128
My uncle to my aunt,
my aunt to my mother...

267
00:14:31,289 --> 00:14:32,722
...my mother to my uncle.

268
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:38,480
My uncle to my cousin, my cousin
to my sister, my sister to me.

269
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:41,686
You should've just had dinner with him
tonight and gotten it over with.

270
00:14:41,849 --> 00:14:44,283
- It's just a movie.
- Just a movie?

271
00:14:44,449 --> 00:14:45,802
You don't understand.

272
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:48,722
This isn't Plans 1-8
from Outer Space.

273
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:50,163
This is Plan 9.

274
00:14:50,329 --> 00:14:52,047
This is the one that worked.

275
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:54,279
The worst movie ever made.

276
00:14:54,609 --> 00:14:56,520
I'm really looking forward to it.

277
00:14:57,689 --> 00:14:59,759
I got news for you.
If we're making this movie...

278
00:14:59,929 --> 00:15:01,328
...we gotta get a table
immediately.

279
00:15:01,489 --> 00:15:04,083
Let's stop fooling around.
Let's just slip him some money.

280
00:15:04,329 --> 00:15:06,718
In a Chinese restaurant?
Do they take money?

281
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,725
"Do they take money?"
Everyone takes money.

282
00:15:11,929 --> 00:15:14,921
I went out with a guy who did it all
the time. You slip them 20 bucks.

283
00:15:15,129 --> 00:15:16,721
Twenty bucks?

284
00:15:17,369 --> 00:15:18,802
Isn't that excessive?

285
00:15:19,289 --> 00:15:21,519
Well, what do you wanna
give him, change?

286
00:15:21,689 --> 00:15:22,883
It's more than the meal.

287
00:15:23,049 --> 00:15:25,768
Oh, come on, we'll divide it up
three ways.

288
00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:29,604
All right. Seven, seven, six.

289
00:15:30,489 --> 00:15:32,559
I'm not gonna eat that much.

290
00:15:32,889 --> 00:15:35,119
I'm counting your shrimps.

291
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,566
Okay, who's gonna do it?

292
00:15:38,329 --> 00:15:39,557
Oh, no, I can't do it.

293
00:15:39,729 --> 00:15:41,765
I'm not good at these things.
I get flustered.

294
00:15:41,929 --> 00:15:44,079
Once I tried to bribe an usher
at the Roller Derby.

295
00:15:44,249 --> 00:15:45,921
I almost got arrested.

296
00:15:46,489 --> 00:15:47,968
I guess it's you, Jer.

297
00:15:48,129 --> 00:15:52,008
- Me? What about you?
- Oh, I can't do that. It's a guy thing.

298
00:15:52,569 --> 00:15:55,288
The women's movement just can't
seem to make any progress...

299
00:15:55,449 --> 00:15:57,644
...in the world of bribery, can they?

300
00:15:59,089 --> 00:16:00,886
Give me the money.

301
00:16:14,449 --> 00:16:16,087
How's it going?

302
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:19,240
Very busy.

303
00:16:22,489 --> 00:16:27,324
Boy, we are really anxious
to sit down.

304
00:16:27,489 --> 00:16:29,844
Very good specials tonight.

305
00:16:34,889 --> 00:16:37,528
If there's anything you can do
to get us a table...

306
00:16:37,689 --> 00:16:39,600
...we'd really appreciate it.

307
00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:41,441
Oh, what is your name?

308
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:44,882
No, no, I wanna eat now.

309
00:16:45,249 --> 00:16:47,558
Yes, whole sea bass dinner tonight,
very fresh.

310
00:16:47,729 --> 00:16:49,924
Here. Take this. I'm starving.

311
00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:52,205
Take it. Take it.

312
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:58,638
Dennison, four!

313
00:16:59,609 --> 00:17:01,440
Your table is ready.

314
00:17:01,609 --> 00:17:03,486
No, no. I want that table.

315
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:05,879
I want that table!

316
00:17:06,409 --> 00:17:09,048
Come on, did you see that?
What was that?

317
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:11,279
He took the money.
He didn't give us a table.

318
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:14,601
- You lost the 20.
- Well, how could he do that?

319
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:16,964
- You didn't make it clear.
- Make it clear?

320
00:17:17,129 --> 00:17:19,848
What a sorry exhibition that was.

321
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:26,364
All right, let me get the money back.

322
00:17:30,489 --> 00:17:32,207
Excuse me.

323
00:17:32,369 --> 00:17:34,803
I realize this is extremely
embarrassing.

324
00:17:34,969 --> 00:17:38,405
My friend here apparently
made a mistake.

325
00:17:38,569 --> 00:17:40,287
Your name?

326
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,488
- Seinfeld.
- Yes, Seinfeld, four.

327
00:17:44,649 --> 00:17:47,447
No, no. Do you see the girl
over there with the long hair?

328
00:17:49,049 --> 00:17:50,562
Oh, yes, yes.

329
00:17:50,729 --> 00:17:54,278
Very beautiful girl. Very beautiful.
Your girlfriend?

330
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:57,009
Well, actually, we did date
for a while, but...

331
00:17:57,169 --> 00:17:59,399
That's really not relevant here.

332
00:17:59,569 --> 00:18:01,446
Relationships are difficult.

333
00:18:01,609 --> 00:18:03,839
It is very hard to stay together-

334
00:18:04,009 --> 00:18:05,681
All right, listen. All right.

335
00:18:05,849 --> 00:18:07,441
How much longer is it gonna be?

336
00:18:10,049 --> 00:18:11,767
Be about five, 10 minutes.

337
00:18:19,369 --> 00:18:20,882
So?

338
00:18:21,049 --> 00:18:24,803
There seems to be
a bit of a discrepancy.

339
00:18:24,969 --> 00:18:27,005
- So when are we gonna eat?
- Five, 10 minutes.

340
00:18:28,369 --> 00:18:30,439
We should've left earlier. I told you.

341
00:18:30,849 --> 00:18:33,079
I don't see any way we can eat
and make this movie.

342
00:18:33,249 --> 00:18:34,887
Oh, well, I have to eat.

343
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:37,005
Let's order it to go,
We'll eat it in the cab.

344
00:18:37,169 --> 00:18:39,399
Eat it in the cab?
Chinese food in a cab?

345
00:18:39,569 --> 00:18:42,322
- We'll eat it in the movie.
- Where do you think you're going?

346
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:44,366
You think they have
big picnic tables there?

347
00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:48,687
- Well, what do you suggest?
- I say we leave now...

348
00:18:48,849 --> 00:18:51,079
...we go to Sky Burger,
and we scarf them down.

349
00:18:51,249 --> 00:18:54,366
I'm not going to Sky Burger.
Besides, it's in the opposite direction.

350
00:18:54,569 --> 00:18:57,288
- Let's just eat popcorn or something.
- Cartwright?

351
00:18:57,649 --> 00:19:00,322
I can't have popcorn for dinner.

352
00:19:00,649 --> 00:19:02,924
- Cartwright!
- I have to eat.

353
00:19:05,529 --> 00:19:06,962
Well, they have hot dogs there.

354
00:19:07,129 --> 00:19:11,281
Oh, movie hot dogs?
I'd rather lick the food off the floor.

355
00:19:11,449 --> 00:19:14,361
I can't go anyway. I have to wait here
for Tatiana's call.

356
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:18,078
Let me just check. Excuse me,
I'm expecting a call. Costanza?

357
00:19:18,729 --> 00:19:20,606
Yes. I just got a call.

358
00:19:20,769 --> 00:19:24,842
I yell,"Cartwright? Cartwright!"
Just like that.

359
00:19:25,009 --> 00:19:27,045
Nobody came up. I hang up.

360
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:32,486
Well, was it for Costanza or...?

361
00:19:32,649 --> 00:19:35,402
Yes, yes, that's it.
Nobody answered.

362
00:19:37,849 --> 00:19:39,362
Was it a woman?

363
00:19:39,529 --> 00:19:40,882
Yes, yes.

364
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:43,244
I tell her you not here.

365
00:19:43,409 --> 00:19:45,559
She said curse word. I hang up.

366
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:51,647
She called.

367
00:19:52,569 --> 00:19:54,639
He yelled, "Cartwright."

368
00:19:55,009 --> 00:19:56,203
I missed her.

369
00:19:56,609 --> 00:19:57,803
Who's Cartwright?

370
00:19:59,169 --> 00:20:00,921
I'm Cartwright.

371
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:05,642
- You're not Cartwright.
- Of course I'm not Cartwright!

372
00:20:07,849 --> 00:20:11,364
Why don't you two go to the movies
by yourselves. I'm not in the mood.

373
00:20:11,569 --> 00:20:13,685
Well, me either.
I'm going to Sky Burger.

374
00:20:14,489 --> 00:20:16,764
- So you're not going?
- You don't need us.

375
00:20:16,969 --> 00:20:19,483
Well, I can't go to a bad movie
by myself.

376
00:20:19,649 --> 00:20:22,721
What, am I gonna make
sarcastic remarks to strangers?

377
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:25,605
I guess I'll just go to my uncle's.

378
00:20:25,769 --> 00:20:29,125
- Should we tell him we're leaving?
- What for? Let's just get out of here.

379
00:20:35,369 --> 00:20:37,041
Seinfeld, four!

380
00:20:38,169 --> 00:20:41,798
Hunger will make people
do amazing things.

381
00:20:41,969 --> 00:20:44,085
I mean, the proof of that
is cannibalism.

382
00:20:44,449 --> 00:20:46,087
Cannibalism. What-?

383
00:20:46,249 --> 00:20:48,888
What do they say? I mean,
they're eating, you know.

384
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:51,199
"This is good. Who is this?

385
00:20:52,449 --> 00:20:54,644
I like this person."

386
00:20:55,289 --> 00:20:56,608
You know, I mean...

387
00:20:56,769 --> 00:20:59,237
I would think the hardest thing
about being a cannibal...

388
00:20:59,409 --> 00:21:02,082
...is trying to get some really
deep sleep.

389
00:21:02,249 --> 00:21:05,082
You know what I mean?
I would think you'd be like:

390
00:21:05,249 --> 00:21:07,922
"What was that? Who's there?

391
00:21:08,089 --> 00:21:09,841
Who's there? Is somebody there?

392
00:21:10,009 --> 00:21:11,488
What do you want?
What do you want?

393
00:21:11,649 --> 00:21:13,480
You look hungry. Are you hungry?

394
00:21:13,649 --> 00:21:14,968
Get out of here."

395
00:22:01,129 --> 00:22:03,120
