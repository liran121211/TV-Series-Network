1
00:00:02,489 --> 00:00:06,767
So I was in the drugstore trying to get
a cold medication. You ever try this?

2
00:00:08,769 --> 00:00:10,282
It's an entire wall of medications.

3
00:00:10,449 --> 00:00:14,158
"All right, all right, okay.
What the hell am I...?

4
00:00:14,329 --> 00:00:18,607
This is quick-acting,
but this is long-lasting.

5
00:00:19,249 --> 00:00:22,161
When do I need to feel good?
Now or later?"

6
00:00:22,329 --> 00:00:23,967
It's a tough question.

7
00:00:24,129 --> 00:00:26,768
Then the commercials on TV
show you what's wrong with the guy.

8
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:30,444
They always show you the problems.
They show you the human body...

9
00:00:30,729 --> 00:00:33,118
...which is usually this guy:

10
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:36,163
No face, mouth open.

11
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:39,401
This is how drug companies
see the public.

12
00:00:40,209 --> 00:00:42,325
And he's always in, like,
a certain pain.

13
00:00:42,489 --> 00:00:44,798
Like, red, wavy lines are going
through him...

14
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:48,518
...or he's glowing.
Parts of him are on fire sometimes.

15
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:50,520
Lightning is attacking him.

16
00:00:51,089 --> 00:00:53,649
I never had a doctor say,
"Are you having pain?

17
00:00:53,809 --> 00:00:56,084
Are you having any lightning
with the pain?"

18
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:06,525
How did you get fleas?

19
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:10,398
My cousin's imbecile dog was outside
and they got in his carpet.

20
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:13,481
Maybe you could get yourself
a little bow tie flea collar.

21
00:01:13,649 --> 00:01:14,843
That's real funny.

22
00:01:15,369 --> 00:01:17,599
So are you coming to the party?

23
00:01:18,489 --> 00:01:20,639
I'd go, but Long Island,
it's so far out.

24
00:01:20,809 --> 00:01:22,367
It smacks of desperation.

25
00:01:22,529 --> 00:01:23,928
Everyone's gonna be saying:

26
00:01:24,089 --> 00:01:26,284
"You came all the way out
from Manhattan for this?"

27
00:01:26,449 --> 00:01:28,679
- You know, Ava's gonna be there.
- Who?

28
00:01:28,849 --> 00:01:30,601
The nice one that works
in my office.

29
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:34,128
- I'll drive!
- Oh, well, now you're talking.

30
00:01:34,289 --> 00:01:35,563
Supposed to be a good party.

31
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,284
Well, what does that mean?
Good dip?

32
00:01:38,929 --> 00:01:40,681
No. There'll be girls there.

33
00:01:40,849 --> 00:01:42,362
There's girls everywhere!

34
00:01:42,529 --> 00:01:44,520
I go out and there's girls
in the elevator.

35
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:47,567
They're in cafeterias, subways.
So what?

36
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:49,959
There's a hundred
different things here.

37
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:53,197
What's the difference
between these two?

38
00:01:53,809 --> 00:01:55,561
- You got propylparaben?
- Got it.

39
00:01:56,129 --> 00:01:57,642
You got isobutane 30?

40
00:01:57,809 --> 00:01:59,481
I got isobutane 20.

41
00:02:01,089 --> 00:02:03,808
You got sorbitan sesquioleate?

42
00:02:03,969 --> 00:02:05,561
- Got it.
- I have aloe.

43
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:07,720
You got aloe?
I love aloe.

44
00:02:07,889 --> 00:02:09,288
Where do they make yours?

45
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:10,928
- Jersey.
- White Plains.

46
00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:16,283
Girls.
There's girls right here in the store.

47
00:02:17,649 --> 00:02:20,402
Look. Look. There's one over there.
Look.

48
00:02:20,809 --> 00:02:22,128
There's another one.

49
00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:24,964
As soon as I walk outside,
there'll be girls.

50
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:26,888
What's the matter?

51
00:02:27,049 --> 00:02:29,040
I gave her a 20,
she gave me change for a 10.

52
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:32,599
Are you sure?
Oh, boy. Here we go.

53
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:35,044
Excuse me.
I gave you a $20 bill...

54
00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:36,927
...and you only gave me
change for a 10.

55
00:02:37,089 --> 00:02:39,728
- You gave me a 10.
- I'm positive I gave you a 20.

56
00:02:39,889 --> 00:02:41,481
I know what you gave me.

57
00:02:41,649 --> 00:02:43,048
You owe me $10.

58
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:44,358
Will you please step aside?

59
00:02:44,529 --> 00:02:46,121
- Next!
- All right, all right.

60
00:02:46,289 --> 00:02:48,849
Let's just examine the situation
for a second.

61
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,400
Who, in this situation, would be
more likely to make a mistake?

62
00:02:52,809 --> 00:02:56,563
Me, who had access to my wallet,
knew exactly what was in there...

63
00:02:56,729 --> 00:02:57,957
- ... or you?
- You.

64
00:02:58,529 --> 00:03:00,759
No, no, no. See, you're not
really listening.

65
00:03:00,929 --> 00:03:03,124
- What's the problem here?
- There's no problem.

66
00:03:03,289 --> 00:03:04,802
She just owes me $10. That's all.

67
00:03:04,969 --> 00:03:07,244
- He's claiming short.
- Let's just take it outside.

68
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:09,639
Oh, so you don't believe me either?!

69
00:03:09,809 --> 00:03:12,528
- Come on. Let's go.
- All right. You haven't won.

70
00:03:12,689 --> 00:03:15,123
You may think you've won,
but you haven't won. Know why?

71
00:03:15,289 --> 00:03:16,961
It's not over. This is not over.

72
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:20,201
I'm not forgetting what's happening
here. You have my $10.

73
00:03:20,369 --> 00:03:23,202
I will get it back. All right.
Don't worry.

74
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,405
And it's not over.
I'm going now.

75
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:28,242
Goodbye. I will be back.

76
00:03:35,289 --> 00:03:37,166
Well, don't stand here.
Let's walk in.

77
00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:38,478
Blend in. Blend in.

78
00:03:38,649 --> 00:03:41,083
No, let's survey first.
Camp here.

79
00:03:41,249 --> 00:03:42,762
Ava.

80
00:03:44,289 --> 00:03:46,723
What could possess anyone
to throw a party?

81
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:50,438
I mean, to have a bunch of strangers
treat your house like a hotel room.

82
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:54,841
- Guess who just sold 129 West 81 st.
- Oh, no, you didn't.

83
00:03:55,009 --> 00:03:56,522
- Get out! When?
- Yesterday.

84
00:03:56,889 --> 00:03:58,607
- I don't believe it.
- Ask Mark.

85
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:01,329
Mark, is this true?

86
00:04:04,649 --> 00:04:09,325
Yeah, this has got "disaster"
written all over it.

87
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:13,801
How did I let you talk me into this?
I must have been out of my mind.

88
00:04:13,969 --> 00:04:15,880
Listen, let's keep an eye
on each other.

89
00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:18,768
In case one of us gets
in a bad conversation...

90
00:04:18,929 --> 00:04:22,365
...we should have a signal
so the other one can get us out of it.

91
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:25,364
- How old are you?
- Thirty-six.

92
00:04:26,209 --> 00:04:27,608
What's the signal?

93
00:04:28,809 --> 00:04:31,721
How about this: chicken wing.

94
00:04:32,089 --> 00:04:34,523
No, no, no.
I got a better one:

95
00:04:34,689 --> 00:04:36,202
Head-patting.

96
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:38,601
Whatever you want.

97
00:04:42,529 --> 00:04:44,565
You came all the way out
from Manhattan for this?

98
00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:46,447
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

99
00:04:47,369 --> 00:04:49,360
So, what do you do?

100
00:04:52,649 --> 00:04:55,561
- I'm a comedian.
- Are you?

101
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:58,562
Let me ask you something.
Where do you get your material?

102
00:04:58,729 --> 00:05:01,323
- I hear a voice.
- What kind of voice?

103
00:05:01,489 --> 00:05:05,323
A man's voice. But he speaks in
German, so I have to get it translated.

104
00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:08,640
How come you keep tapping
your head?

105
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,128
It's a nervous tick.

106
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:11,927
I'm on L-dopa.

107
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:15,844
On the other hand, you take a guy
like George Washington Carver.

108
00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:19,240
The man devoted his whole life
to the peanut.

109
00:05:19,409 --> 00:05:22,481
Imagine having so much passion
for something.

110
00:05:24,049 --> 00:05:26,768
You know, people tell me
I'm a funny guy.

111
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:32,482
I've often wondered if he ever worked
with the pecan.

112
00:05:33,329 --> 00:05:35,081
Yeah. Me too.

113
00:05:35,249 --> 00:05:39,242
Now, is that considered a nut?
I know the cashew is a legume.

114
00:05:42,929 --> 00:05:44,999
- How's it going?
- Great. How about you?

115
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:47,367
I can't believe
what's happening here.

116
00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:49,440
She hasn't taken her hands
off me all night.

117
00:05:49,609 --> 00:05:52,362
She was always friendly around
the office, but that was it.

118
00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:54,485
- How do you account for this?
- I don't know.

119
00:05:54,649 --> 00:05:56,685
Maybe a safe fell on her head.

120
00:05:57,809 --> 00:05:59,481
Well, she obviously
liked you all along.

121
00:05:59,649 --> 00:06:01,241
No. I would have picked up on it.

122
00:06:01,409 --> 00:06:04,719
I can always tell. Women always
somehow let you know.

123
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:07,244
With me, they could torture me,
I wouldn't tell them.

124
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:09,479
I try to make them think
I don't like them.

125
00:06:09,649 --> 00:06:11,844
Then they think,
"Oh, this guy's not even looking.

126
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:13,920
He must have something
going for him."

127
00:06:14,089 --> 00:06:16,045
Anyway, I'm ready to go.

128
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,518
- Now?
- Well, if not now, when?

129
00:06:19,249 --> 00:06:22,082
- Give me a half-hour.
- Okay. Half-hour.

130
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:26,083
Peanut brittle, peanut butter,
peanut oil...

131
00:06:26,249 --> 00:06:27,568
Can I talk to you for a second?

132
00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:29,401
Oh, excuse me.

133
00:06:31,049 --> 00:06:35,406
What have you been doing? I've
been smacking myself senseless.

134
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:37,881
People think I'm a mental patient.

135
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:39,888
Hey, I was dying over there.

136
00:06:40,129 --> 00:06:42,085
This guy's going off on the peanut.

137
00:06:42,249 --> 00:06:43,841
Now, pay attention.

138
00:06:44,089 --> 00:06:46,205
Yeah, I think I've seen you in a club.

139
00:06:46,369 --> 00:06:49,088
- You talk about everyday things, right?
- Right.

140
00:06:49,249 --> 00:06:51,319
Yeah. I remember you.

141
00:06:53,809 --> 00:06:55,640
I wonder what happened
to my fiancé.

142
00:06:56,169 --> 00:06:57,488
I know he's here somewhere.

143
00:06:57,969 --> 00:07:00,483
Ellen, have you seen my fiancé?

144
00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:02,605
- He's upstairs.
- Are you going upstairs?

145
00:07:02,769 --> 00:07:05,158
Tell my fiancé I'm looking for him.

146
00:07:05,329 --> 00:07:09,322
I have lost my fiancé,
the poor baby.

147
00:07:11,809 --> 00:07:13,800
Maybe the dingo ate your baby.

148
00:07:17,329 --> 00:07:18,557
What?

149
00:07:18,969 --> 00:07:22,006
The dingo ate your baby.

150
00:07:30,089 --> 00:07:31,238
You ready?

151
00:07:31,849 --> 00:07:32,998
Listen, I...

152
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:34,761
...have a tremendous favour to ask.

153
00:07:34,929 --> 00:07:36,123
I do favours.

154
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:39,157
- I think something's happening here.
- What?

155
00:07:39,729 --> 00:07:41,321
I think she wants me
to take her home.

156
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:46,286
- What should I do?
- Go. What can you do?

157
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:48,685
- What about you and Elaine?
- We'll get a ride.

158
00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:50,999
- You're sure?
- We'll be fine. What did she say?

159
00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:52,843
She told me she-

160
00:07:55,089 --> 00:07:57,808
She told me she wants me
to make love to her.

161
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:01,478
- What? She said that?
- Yeah.

162
00:08:02,209 --> 00:08:04,598
- Get out of here.
- I swear.

163
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:07,482
- What did you say?
- I...

164
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:10,728
- Oh, I can't.
- Come on. What did you say?

165
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:12,800
- Please, it's, it's...
- What?

166
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:15,248
"I..."

167
00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:18,761
"I..."

168
00:08:21,049 --> 00:08:23,404
"I long for you."

169
00:08:23,689 --> 00:08:25,327
- "I long for you"?
- I was so shocked...

170
00:08:25,489 --> 00:08:29,641
- ... I was lucky I said anything.
- It's okay. That's not bad.

171
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:33,245
I don't like when a woman says
"Make love to me."It's intimidating.

172
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:36,845
The last time a woman said that to me,
I wound up apologizing to her.

173
00:08:37,569 --> 00:08:39,048
- Really?
- That's a lot of pressure.

174
00:08:39,209 --> 00:08:42,599
"Make love to me."
What am I, in the circus?

175
00:08:42,769 --> 00:08:44,566
- What if I can't deliver?
- Oh, come on.

176
00:08:44,729 --> 00:08:46,287
I can't perform under pressure.

177
00:08:46,689 --> 00:08:49,840
That's why I never play anything
for money. I choke.

178
00:08:50,009 --> 00:08:52,045
I could choke tonight.

179
00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:54,086
And she works in my office.
Can you imagine?

180
00:08:54,249 --> 00:08:56,524
If she goes around telling everyone
what happened...

181
00:08:56,689 --> 00:08:59,328
Maybe I should cancel.
I have a very bad feeling about this.

182
00:08:59,489 --> 00:09:04,517
- George, you're thinking too much.
- I know, I know. I can't stop it.

183
00:09:05,969 --> 00:09:09,325
Well, right now I'm reading
manuscripts for Pendant Publishing.

184
00:09:09,489 --> 00:09:12,049
Pendant? Those bastards.

185
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:14,404
Excuse me.

186
00:09:16,929 --> 00:09:19,568
Listen, George is going home
with this Ava from his office.

187
00:09:19,889 --> 00:09:21,481
Really?

188
00:09:21,689 --> 00:09:23,407
What a world.

189
00:09:24,209 --> 00:09:27,087
- So we can go now.
- No, he's taking the car.

190
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:30,687
- What are we gonna do for a ride?
- I don't know.

191
00:09:32,129 --> 00:09:35,201
- You don't know?
- Maybe Kramer can come pick us up.

192
00:09:36,369 --> 00:09:39,566
Great. Oh, this is great.
How could you let him take the car?

193
00:09:39,729 --> 00:09:42,323
There's nothing I could do.
It's part of the code.

194
00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:46,798
All plans between men are tentative.

195
00:09:47,089 --> 00:09:50,240
If one man should suddenly have
an opportunity to pursue a woman...

196
00:09:50,409 --> 00:09:53,446
...it's like these two guys never met
each other ever in life.

197
00:09:53,609 --> 00:09:56,442
This is the male code.

198
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:59,527
And it doesn't matter how important
the arrangements are.

199
00:09:59,689 --> 00:10:02,522
Most of the time, they screw up
a space shuttle mission, it's because...

200
00:10:02,689 --> 00:10:05,522
...one of the astronauts met someone
on his way to the launch pad.

201
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:07,884
They hold that countdown.

202
00:10:08,049 --> 00:10:09,801
He's leaning against the rocket:

203
00:10:09,969 --> 00:10:13,598
"So when I get back, what do you say
we get together for some Tang?"

204
00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:16,997
Oh, look at what she's wearing.
You see what she's wearing?

205
00:10:17,169 --> 00:10:18,363
Yeah, yeah, all right.

206
00:10:18,529 --> 00:10:20,679
I can't believe
she's walking around in that.

207
00:10:20,849 --> 00:10:23,079
- Just don't make a scene.
- Hey, is that real fur?

208
00:10:23,249 --> 00:10:25,126
- Oh, boy.
- It better be.

209
00:10:25,289 --> 00:10:26,961
Or my ex-husband owes me
an explanation.

210
00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:28,357
Good night.

211
00:10:28,689 --> 00:10:30,884
You don't care that innocent,
defenceless animals...

212
00:10:31,049 --> 00:10:32,482
...are tortured so you look good?

213
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:34,401
Could we talk about this
some other time?

214
00:10:34,569 --> 00:10:36,685
- Are you a vegetarian?
- Here we go.

215
00:10:36,849 --> 00:10:38,760
Yeah. I eat fish occasionally.

216
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:40,328
- So you're a hypocrite.
- Hey!

217
00:10:40,489 --> 00:10:42,878
I've eaten frogs, so nobody's perfect.

218
00:10:43,049 --> 00:10:44,198
Anyway...

219
00:10:44,369 --> 00:10:47,566
- Talk to me when you stop eating fish.
- Fish don't feel any pain.

220
00:10:47,729 --> 00:10:49,640
How do you know?
Do you communicate with fish?

221
00:10:49,809 --> 00:10:51,686
Well, they're not kept in little cages.

222
00:10:51,849 --> 00:10:53,601
- Ever seen a goldfish?
- Goldfish!

223
00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:55,964
Yeah. Yeah, I've seen goldfish.
They're not unhappy.

224
00:10:56,129 --> 00:10:57,881
Right. Swim around a bowl
for two weeks...

225
00:10:58,049 --> 00:11:00,358
...and get flushed down the toilet.
That's a good life.

226
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:01,962
Oh, yeah. That's right.

227
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:04,518
Go ahead. Go ahead.
Maybe you can run over a squirrel!

228
00:11:04,689 --> 00:11:08,045
Yeah, well, that's why we're here
in America.

229
00:11:08,449 --> 00:11:11,043
- You're beautiful.
- Call Kramer.

230
00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:12,801
All right.

231
00:11:12,969 --> 00:11:15,199
Excuse me.
This is your party, right?

232
00:11:15,369 --> 00:11:17,963
- No. I just live here.
- Can I use your phone?

233
00:11:18,129 --> 00:11:19,357
What's in it for me?

234
00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:21,645
- A bigger bill.
- Go for it.

235
00:11:25,649 --> 00:11:27,207
Kram, Sein.

236
00:11:27,369 --> 00:11:28,961
What are you doing?

237
00:11:29,409 --> 00:11:31,559
Well, I'm stuck out here
on Long Island.

238
00:11:31,729 --> 00:11:33,924
What are your thoughts
about taking a ride?

239
00:11:34,089 --> 00:11:35,647
You're sure?

240
00:11:35,809 --> 00:11:38,846
Okay, but don't leave me
hanging here.

241
00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:40,727
Okay, great.
Let me give you directions.

242
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:50,325
You sure you don't need any help?

243
00:11:50,489 --> 00:11:52,445
No, not really.

244
00:11:52,609 --> 00:11:54,565
I'm sure he'll be here any minute.

245
00:11:54,729 --> 00:11:56,287
I want them out of here.

246
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:59,686
- Call him again.
- I called. What should I do?

247
00:12:00,449 --> 00:12:02,246
We really appreciate this.

248
00:12:03,169 --> 00:12:04,966
It's 2:00 in the morning.

249
00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:06,926
Oh, you got the Civil War book.

250
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:11,640
I saw some of that show.
It was wonderful.

251
00:12:11,809 --> 00:12:14,767
620 million people died.

252
00:12:14,929 --> 00:12:16,078
Thousand.

253
00:12:16,249 --> 00:12:18,809
Thousand! 620,000.

254
00:12:18,969 --> 00:12:21,164
The horror. The horror!

255
00:12:21,329 --> 00:12:23,718
The wife keeps giving us dirty looks.

256
00:12:23,889 --> 00:12:26,767
Are you sure you gave him
the right directions?

257
00:12:26,929 --> 00:12:28,726
- You sure there's nothing we can do?
- No!

258
00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:30,925
I am not going to bed
with them in our house.

259
00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:32,317
This is ridiculous.

260
00:12:32,489 --> 00:12:36,198
You know, a friend of my father's
used to live right around here.

261
00:12:36,849 --> 00:12:38,362
Mike Wichter.

262
00:12:40,489 --> 00:12:42,127
He sold plastic straws.

263
00:12:42,289 --> 00:12:43,438
You know the ones?

264
00:12:43,609 --> 00:12:45,122
You could bend them.

265
00:12:47,249 --> 00:12:52,198
Have you noticed? People don't use
straws as much as they used to.

266
00:12:52,369 --> 00:12:55,122
You know, it doesn't look
as if your friend is coming.

267
00:12:55,289 --> 00:12:56,278
Oh, he's coming.

268
00:12:56,449 --> 00:12:59,725
Maybe you should take a look
at a train schedule.

269
00:13:01,689 --> 00:13:03,327
That's him.

270
00:13:03,729 --> 00:13:05,447
I'm going to bed!

271
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,722
- Thanks a lot.
- Thanks.

272
00:13:08,249 --> 00:13:09,887
Great party.

273
00:13:12,569 --> 00:13:14,764
- Hey, how you doing?
- Look who's here.

274
00:13:16,569 --> 00:13:17,968
- I'm sorry.
- Hey, it's okay.

275
00:13:18,129 --> 00:13:20,245
I had the directions on the seat
right next to me.

276
00:13:20,409 --> 00:13:22,206
They flew out the window.

277
00:13:23,049 --> 00:13:24,607
Then how did you find the place?

278
00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:27,078
Well, I knew the exit
on the Long Island Expressway...

279
00:13:27,249 --> 00:13:31,686
...and I thought that the address
was 8713 Riviera Drive.

280
00:13:31,849 --> 00:13:33,885
So I drove around...

281
00:13:34,049 --> 00:13:36,404
...knocking on everybody's doors
that had those numbers.

282
00:13:36,569 --> 00:13:41,245
8317, 7813, 3718, 1837...

283
00:13:42,009 --> 00:13:44,125
Finally, I hit it. 8173.

284
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:48,078
Anyway, thanks a lot for letting us
stay here, Steve. I really owe you one.

285
00:13:48,249 --> 00:13:49,443
No problem.

286
00:13:49,609 --> 00:13:51,406
And if you're ever in the city...

287
00:13:51,569 --> 00:13:53,799
...you wanna come to a comedy club,
whatever.

288
00:13:53,969 --> 00:13:55,880
Hey, I might take you up on that.

289
00:13:56,049 --> 00:13:58,244
Here's my address and number.

290
00:13:58,409 --> 00:13:59,967
And, really, thanks again.

291
00:14:01,409 --> 00:14:02,603
Well, you better zip up.

292
00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:05,239
I couldn't get the top
on the convertible up.

293
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:11,158
- But it's cold out.
- Wait till we get on the Expressway.

294
00:14:16,049 --> 00:14:19,359
George, I've been sick all week.
Elaine was too.

295
00:14:19,529 --> 00:14:22,362
Eighty miles an hour, 40 degree
temperature for 50 minutes.

296
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,201
Do the math.

297
00:14:25,249 --> 00:14:26,967
Yeah, maybe I will get out.

298
00:14:27,129 --> 00:14:30,246
But let me just stop off
at the drugstore first.

299
00:14:30,409 --> 00:14:33,321
Meet me down there in 15 minutes,
then we'll go do something.

300
00:14:33,489 --> 00:14:34,968
Yeah, Selwyn's.

301
00:14:35,129 --> 00:14:36,323
Okay, bye.

302
00:14:41,329 --> 00:14:44,048
- Who is it?
- Mr. Pocatillo!

303
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:47,519
- Who?
- You don't recognize my voice?

304
00:14:48,449 --> 00:14:51,202
- Jerry, baby!
- Do I know you?

305
00:14:51,609 --> 00:14:54,919
- Boy, this comedy's frying your brain.
- I'm sorry...

306
00:14:55,089 --> 00:14:57,967
See, this is the kind of lasting
impression I make on people.

307
00:14:58,129 --> 00:15:01,599
- Oh, okay.
- You said if I was ever in the city.

308
00:15:02,209 --> 00:15:03,642
I'm in the city!

309
00:15:03,809 --> 00:15:06,084
You certainly are.

310
00:15:07,249 --> 00:15:08,364
What's going on?

311
00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:11,965
I'm just waiting for a lift back.
He won't be ready until 11.

312
00:15:12,169 --> 00:15:13,568
I figured I'd give you a break...

313
00:15:13,729 --> 00:15:16,368
...see what it's like to hang out
with someone in show business.

314
00:15:16,529 --> 00:15:20,283
Listen, I'm really sorry, but I'm just
on my way out to meet a friend.

315
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:23,407
Oh, come on. You can come up
with something better than that.

316
00:15:23,569 --> 00:15:25,605
No, really, I just got off the phone
with him.

317
00:15:26,489 --> 00:15:28,127
I understand.

318
00:15:28,689 --> 00:15:31,078
Look, you can hang out here
if you want.

319
00:15:32,329 --> 00:15:33,728
Don't be so enthusiastic.

320
00:15:33,929 --> 00:15:36,807
- No, it's...
- I'm not gonna steal anything.

321
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:39,324
No, of course not. Just...

322
00:15:39,489 --> 00:15:41,161
...close the door when you leave.

323
00:15:41,329 --> 00:15:44,241
- I think I can do that.
- Really, I'm sorry.

324
00:15:44,409 --> 00:15:45,637
Maybe another time.

325
00:15:46,049 --> 00:15:47,607
Yeah. Let's have lunch.

326
00:15:48,929 --> 00:15:51,204
The guy's in my house right now.

327
00:15:51,369 --> 00:15:54,759
What a mistake that party was.
I never should've gone.

328
00:15:54,929 --> 00:15:57,238
- Yeah, me either.
- Oh, come on.

329
00:15:57,809 --> 00:16:00,846
What "come on"? Have you ever dated
a woman that worked in your office?

330
00:16:01,129 --> 00:16:04,678
- I never had a job.
- Know that anxiety you feel on a date?

331
00:16:04,849 --> 00:16:07,682
That's what I have every day now.
My worst nightmare's come true.

332
00:16:07,849 --> 00:16:09,567
Every day is a date.

333
00:16:09,729 --> 00:16:13,642
That's one of Dante's nine stages
of hell, isn't it?

334
00:16:13,809 --> 00:16:15,765
Ava was one of the reasons
I used to like work.

335
00:16:15,929 --> 00:16:17,248
She was a friend.

336
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:20,640
Now we sleep together and suddenly
I don't know how to talk to her.

337
00:16:20,809 --> 00:16:23,039
Every time I go to the bathroom,
I pass her desk.

338
00:16:23,209 --> 00:16:26,246
I have to plan little patter.
I spend half my day writing.

339
00:16:26,409 --> 00:16:29,162
Then afterwards I sit in my office
and analyse how it went.

340
00:16:29,329 --> 00:16:32,765
If it was a good conversation, I don't
go to the bathroom the rest of the day.

341
00:16:32,929 --> 00:16:35,159
I see her laughing
and talking with other people.

342
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:37,399
They're all so loose and relaxed.
I think:

343
00:16:37,569 --> 00:16:40,322
"That used to be me.
I wanna go back there again."

344
00:16:40,489 --> 00:16:43,049
- What are you gonna do?
- I have no choice.

345
00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:44,688
I'm quitting.

346
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:50,803
The party, Long Island.

347
00:16:51,089 --> 00:16:52,966
- Kramer, right?
- Yeah.

348
00:16:53,129 --> 00:16:55,404
- Hey, what are you doing here?
- Waiting for my ride.

349
00:16:55,569 --> 00:16:57,799
- Where's Jerry?
- He split.

350
00:16:57,969 --> 00:16:59,960
Let me ask you something.

351
00:17:00,129 --> 00:17:03,041
Is there anything to drink in here?
Or is that a stupid question?

352
00:17:04,249 --> 00:17:06,046
Jerry, he doesn't have anything.

353
00:17:07,249 --> 00:17:09,160
But I might have something.

354
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:12,920
I'm gonna get this.
This looks good.

355
00:17:13,969 --> 00:17:16,483
- How much is that?
- $9.60.

356
00:17:17,009 --> 00:17:18,681
$9.60?

357
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:20,684
Give it to me.

358
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:22,202
- Why?
- Don't worry, I got it.

359
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:24,525
- What do you mean, you got it?
- I got it.

360
00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:28,045
Since when are you treating me
to medicine? What are you doing?

361
00:17:28,489 --> 00:17:31,447
- You're stealing this, aren't you?
- I'm not stealing. They owe me $10.

362
00:17:31,609 --> 00:17:33,247
- They stole from me.
- You're a lunatic.

363
00:17:33,409 --> 00:17:35,081
I have to. It's a matter of honour.

364
00:17:35,649 --> 00:17:37,207
What do you say
to a person like you?

365
00:17:37,409 --> 00:17:38,888
Just walk.
You don't even know me.

366
00:17:41,209 --> 00:17:42,483
Excuse me.

367
00:17:44,369 --> 00:17:45,563
What do you got there?

368
00:17:46,929 --> 00:17:50,126
- What?
- What do you got in your shirt?

369
00:17:54,769 --> 00:17:56,646
- I was gonna pay for this.
- Come with me.

370
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:59,004
Where are you taking me?
I was gonna pay for it.

371
00:17:59,169 --> 00:18:01,637
- Don't think I remember you?
- What are you talking about?

372
00:18:01,809 --> 00:18:03,481
I know who you are!
I was watching you.

373
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:05,799
What are you gonna do?
You gonna call the police?

374
00:18:05,969 --> 00:18:08,039
- Come on!
- Where-!

375
00:18:09,049 --> 00:18:12,200
Can I still buy this
or is this evidence now?

376
00:18:12,369 --> 00:18:14,599
So I'm chasing these doves
down the street...

377
00:18:14,769 --> 00:18:17,488
...and she's screaming
at the top of her lungs...

378
00:18:17,649 --> 00:18:20,083
...and then when the magician
comes back from Europe...

379
00:18:20,249 --> 00:18:22,126
...two of them turn brown!

380
00:18:22,289 --> 00:18:25,201
Well, I followed the instructions!

381
00:18:30,889 --> 00:18:32,925
They turned brown!

382
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:38,605
- Brown!
- Brown!

383
00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:49,484
So let me ask you something.
You know any women we could call?

384
00:18:49,649 --> 00:18:51,321
Not really.

385
00:18:51,849 --> 00:18:54,079
Maybe we should call
one of those escort services.

386
00:18:54,249 --> 00:18:55,318
Yeah.

387
00:18:55,729 --> 00:18:59,165
I saw one of them advertised
before on the cable station.

388
00:18:59,329 --> 00:19:01,081
555-LOVE.

389
00:19:02,929 --> 00:19:04,681
- Are you in on this?
- Oh, no, no.

390
00:19:04,849 --> 00:19:07,409
I got a girl in the next building.

391
00:19:10,929 --> 00:19:14,365
Now, I want my money, mister!
And I ain't leaving till I get it.

392
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,480
Now, I am through
playing games with you.

393
00:19:19,649 --> 00:19:21,321
I got things to do.

394
00:19:22,849 --> 00:19:24,646
Oh, Jerry, Jerry.

395
00:19:24,809 --> 00:19:26,401
Look who's here.
It's Jerry.

396
00:19:26,569 --> 00:19:27,718
What the hell-?

397
00:19:27,889 --> 00:19:31,086
- Jerry, this is Patti.
- Nice to meet you.

398
00:19:31,249 --> 00:19:32,921
A pleasure to make
your acquaintance.

399
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:34,442
What the hell is going on here?

400
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:36,839
I don't know,
but I gotta do this more often.

401
00:19:39,689 --> 00:19:41,645
There's my ride, finally.

402
00:19:41,809 --> 00:19:44,642
I'm not gonna go anywhere
until I get the rest of my money.

403
00:19:44,889 --> 00:19:48,279
See you, Jer, and tell Kramer thanks.
I'll call him tomorrow.

404
00:19:48,449 --> 00:19:49,723
Oh, Kramer.

405
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:51,766
Yeah, he's a hoot.

406
00:19:53,489 --> 00:19:54,968
Goodbye, my dear.

407
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:01,807
Weekend of the 26th, come on out.
We're having another party.

408
00:20:03,449 --> 00:20:04,643
I ain't leaving.

409
00:20:05,409 --> 00:20:07,843
- Patti.
- You got anything to drink?

410
00:20:08,889 --> 00:20:11,881
- All right, how much does he owe you?
- $50.

411
00:20:13,209 --> 00:20:15,006
Fifty dollars...

412
00:20:19,529 --> 00:20:21,485
- Is this your apartment?
- Yeah, but-

413
00:20:21,649 --> 00:20:25,483
- You're under arrest for solicitation.
- Oh, wait a second. I...

414
00:20:26,569 --> 00:20:27,968
I have chicken soup.

415
00:20:30,449 --> 00:20:31,643
Is that real fur?

416
00:20:31,809 --> 00:20:33,561
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, boy.

417
00:20:36,489 --> 00:20:39,083
You had Sergeant Chadway?
Me too.

418
00:20:39,449 --> 00:20:41,758
- He was a nice guy.
- Oh, great guy.

419
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:44,840
Was there a redheaded guy there?

420
00:20:45,009 --> 00:20:46,761
- The one with the long sideburns?
- Yeah!

421
00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:48,408
- Where does he come off?
- I know.

422
00:20:48,569 --> 00:20:50,924
There's no call
for that kind of attitude.

423
00:20:51,569 --> 00:20:53,924
One of the guys in my cell
threw a piece of gum at him.

424
00:20:54,089 --> 00:20:56,319
We all hated him.

425
00:20:57,169 --> 00:20:59,399
There's two types of favours:
big favour, small favour.

426
00:20:59,569 --> 00:21:01,639
You can measure the size
of the favour...

427
00:21:01,809 --> 00:21:06,405
...by the pause that a person takes
after they ask you to "do me a favour."

428
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:09,921
Small favour, small pause:
"Do me a favour? Hand me that pencil."

429
00:21:10,089 --> 00:21:11,363
No pause at all.

430
00:21:11,529 --> 00:21:14,123
Big favours are:
"Could you do me a favour?"

431
00:22:02,289 --> 00:22:04,280
