1
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:05,120
I'm not a foodie.

2
00:00:05,289 --> 00:00:06,483
I don't:

3
00:00:06,649 --> 00:00:08,446
"Oh, this is too rare.
Oh, it's too salty."

4
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:11,647
Just eat it and shut up.

5
00:00:11,809 --> 00:00:14,243
I'll eat anywhere,
whatever they're having.

6
00:00:14,409 --> 00:00:19,119
I've eaten rolls off of
room-service trays in hotel hallways.

7
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:21,120
I have. That's not a joke.

8
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:22,517
This is my life.

9
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:25,768
I don't know, somebody left it.

10
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:28,648
Why would somebody poison a roll
and leave it in the hallway...

11
00:00:28,809 --> 00:00:31,323
...for some comic coming down
at 2:00 in the morning?

12
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:33,440
Why would they do that?

13
00:00:34,089 --> 00:00:37,320
Sometimes you go to a restaurant,
they put the check in a little book.

14
00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:40,208
What is this,
the story of the bill?

15
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:45,402
"Once upon a time, there were some
very hungry people."What is this?

16
00:00:45,569 --> 00:00:48,720
Little gold tassel hanging down.
Am I graduating from the restaurant?

17
00:00:48,889 --> 00:00:50,447
What is this about?

18
00:00:59,689 --> 00:01:01,202
You want some of mine?

19
00:01:01,689 --> 00:01:04,965
- Take some of mine.
- Why do I get pesto?

20
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:07,324
Why do I think I'll like it?

21
00:01:07,489 --> 00:01:09,047
I keep trying to like it.

22
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:11,723
- Like I have to like it.
- Who said you have to like it?

23
00:01:11,889 --> 00:01:13,447
Everybody likes pesto.

24
00:01:13,609 --> 00:01:16,521
You walk into a restaurant,
that's all you hear. Pesto. Pesto.

25
00:01:16,809 --> 00:01:20,563
- I don't like pesto.
- Where was pesto 10 years ago?

26
00:01:22,209 --> 00:01:23,608
Look at that guy.

27
00:01:26,049 --> 00:01:28,165
I'll bet you he's getting
hair transplants.

28
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:34,085
Anytime you see a guy that age
wearing a baseball cap, 10-1, plugs.

29
00:01:35,809 --> 00:01:39,245
The thing about that painting
is with the colours and...

30
00:01:39,649 --> 00:01:41,446
Oh, yeah, plugola.

31
00:01:42,609 --> 00:01:45,123
One more thing about the car.
Let it warm up for a minute.

32
00:01:45,529 --> 00:01:47,087
Yeah, that's a tough minute.

33
00:01:47,249 --> 00:01:50,605
It's like waiting in the shower
for the conditioner to work.

34
00:01:51,769 --> 00:01:53,680
I don't understand why
he couldn't take a cab.

35
00:01:53,849 --> 00:01:56,727
- Who?
- Elaine is having...

36
00:01:56,889 --> 00:01:58,288
...a houseguest.

37
00:01:58,449 --> 00:02:00,405
She's picking him up
at the airport tonight.

38
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:03,606
- A guy?
- Yes, it's a guy.

39
00:02:03,769 --> 00:02:07,205
He's from Yakima, right?

40
00:02:07,849 --> 00:02:10,568
- Seattle.
- Everybody's moving to Seattle.

41
00:02:10,849 --> 00:02:12,567
It's the pesto of cities. So?

42
00:02:13,529 --> 00:02:14,723
Well, you tell.

43
00:02:15,089 --> 00:02:20,038
Well, from what I can piece together,
our friend here met a gentleman-

44
00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:22,245
- Ed.
- Who was in town...

45
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:25,606
...on a business venture, and...?

46
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:29,682
We shared
an interpersonal experience.

47
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:33,680
- Go on.
- So they went out a few times...

48
00:02:34,169 --> 00:02:36,558
...but, apparently, when the fellow
returned home...

49
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:40,563
...he discovered that the Benes tattoo
does not wash off so easily.

50
00:02:40,729 --> 00:02:43,084
On some people.

51
00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:45,646
So he's coming to stay with her
for a week.

52
00:02:45,809 --> 00:02:49,358
It was just gonna be a weekend,
but then, somehow, it became a week.

53
00:02:52,689 --> 00:02:54,042
- Wait a second.
- All right, okay.

54
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:56,564
- All right, all right, okay.
- What happened?

55
00:02:56,729 --> 00:03:02,486
Oh, the busboy left the menu
a little close to the candle.

56
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:04,002
I'm sorry for the disturbance.

57
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:06,400
- I'm never eating here again.
- Yeah.

58
00:03:08,809 --> 00:03:10,322
- Nice going.
- Thank you.

59
00:03:10,929 --> 00:03:13,124
- That ought to get us a free dessert.
- Yeah.

60
00:03:14,089 --> 00:03:15,442
I think the busboy's in trouble.

61
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:20,325
Did I get him in trouble
because of what I said?

62
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:22,957
I just told him what happened.
He didn't do it on purpose.

63
00:03:24,089 --> 00:03:25,408
He pointed at me.

64
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:28,402
- Why did they point at me?
- I said I would never eat here again...

65
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:30,480
...but he had to know I was kidding.

66
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:33,040
I didn't say anything.

67
00:03:34,809 --> 00:03:37,198
I can't believe it. He's going.
He's fired.

68
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:41,647
- Oh, I said it in a kidding way.
- I didn't know he'd get fired.

69
00:03:41,809 --> 00:03:44,164
He'll probably kill his family
over this.

70
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:46,640
What if he's waiting for me outside?

71
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,481
He pointed at me.
Did you see him point?

72
00:03:48,649 --> 00:03:50,765
Lot of ex-cons become busboys.

73
00:03:51,929 --> 00:03:53,999
They seem to gravitate towards it.

74
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:55,921
- Was it my fault?
- Was it my fault?

75
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,446
Maybe I'll try that pesto.

76
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:04,720
Look, I feel bad for him too,
but he'll get another job.

77
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:08,006
Let's face it, it's not a profession
where you embellish your résumé...

78
00:04:08,169 --> 00:04:11,206
...and undergo a series
of gruelling interviews.

79
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:15,643
- Like you really know busboys.
- Oh, like you do.

80
00:04:15,809 --> 00:04:18,277
- Hey, at least I was a camp waiter.
- Camp.

81
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:21,361
It was a fat camp.
Those kids depended on me.

82
00:04:25,409 --> 00:04:27,206
- Elaine?
- Yeah.

83
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:31,449
Busboys are always changing jobs.
That's the business.

84
00:04:31,609 --> 00:04:33,281
I know, I work with these guys.

85
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:35,679
I talk with them in the kitchens
at the comedy clubs.

86
00:04:35,849 --> 00:04:37,362
Why don't you get him another job?

87
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:39,963
I'd love to. But I don't know
anything about him.

88
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:44,042
He could walk around the street
pricking people with pins.

89
00:04:47,369 --> 00:04:49,360
I don't know if you people
are aware of this...

90
00:04:49,529 --> 00:04:51,520
...but I am one clever chickadee.

91
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:53,361
What, did you get
the busboy's number?

92
00:04:53,529 --> 00:04:56,885
His phone's been disconnected,
but I was able to obtain an address.

93
00:04:57,049 --> 00:05:00,200
1324 Amsterdam Avenue,
apartment 4D.

94
00:05:01,289 --> 00:05:03,120
Now, I did my job.

95
00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:06,486
- May I have the car keys, please?
- How did you get all this?

96
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:09,527
Does the word "charm"
mean anything to you?

97
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:10,963
No.

98
00:05:14,809 --> 00:05:17,277
Now you're going to his apartment?
I think this is nuts.

99
00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:21,283
I'd like to apologize. I wanna tell him
I didn't mean to get him in trouble.

100
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:23,246
- So you're going now?
- Yeah.

101
00:05:23,409 --> 00:05:25,206
I'm gonna see if there's anything
I can do.

102
00:05:25,369 --> 00:05:27,439
Get him another job.
Maybe I'll hear of something.

103
00:05:27,609 --> 00:05:29,645
Maybe the fat camp.

104
00:05:31,809 --> 00:05:33,083
- You're not going?
- I would...

105
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,365
...but I have to pick up Ed
at the airport.

106
00:05:35,529 --> 00:05:37,599
I just don't think
you should go alone.

107
00:05:37,769 --> 00:05:40,237
- Can't you wait till after my set?
- It will take too long.

108
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:41,603
- Hey.
- Hey.

109
00:05:41,769 --> 00:05:43,566
Take the K-Man.

110
00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:45,685
A little support.

111
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:49,043
- I don't...
- What? What? Take me where?

112
00:05:49,209 --> 00:05:50,961
Where?

113
00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:00,524
Look, I really appreciate
your coming...

114
00:06:00,689 --> 00:06:04,045
...but if you wouldn't mind...

115
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:07,080
...try not to say too much.

116
00:06:09,409 --> 00:06:11,127
What am I gonna say?

117
00:06:12,089 --> 00:06:13,602
I don't know.

118
00:06:13,849 --> 00:06:15,601
Well, I'm not an idiot.

119
00:06:18,089 --> 00:06:19,568
Certainly not.

120
00:06:20,409 --> 00:06:21,842
Then we're cool.

121
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,528
Yeah.

122
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:26,998
Yeah, we're cool.

123
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:45,088
I'm sorry to bother you.
I was in the restaurant earlier...

124
00:06:45,249 --> 00:06:48,719
...and I was wondering if I could
talk to you about what happened.

125
00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:55,601
Thanks.

126
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:08,679
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
It's just that...

127
00:07:08,849 --> 00:07:13,047
...I think I may have,
without realizing it...

128
00:07:13,689 --> 00:07:16,203
...been responsible
for getting you fired.

129
00:07:18,809 --> 00:07:20,128
And I just-

130
00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:24,043
I wanted you to know that I did
not intend for that to happen.

131
00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:27,328
He's a hell of a guy.

132
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:29,368
This is...

133
00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:32,045
...a guy I know. Kramer.

134
00:07:33,249 --> 00:07:34,807
Oh, my God.

135
00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:40,881
Waterbed?

136
00:07:43,849 --> 00:07:45,726
Anyway, I...

137
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:50,485
I just wanted to let you know
that I'm really sorry that happened.

138
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:55,040
And if I can help out in any way,
I'll certainly be glad to do that.

139
00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:00,038
Well, I guess that's about it.

140
00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:02,480
You got anything to drink?

141
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:07,608
- We really should be going.
- Let me get a glass of water.

142
00:08:07,929 --> 00:08:09,362
Hurry up.

143
00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:12,401
Paquita?

144
00:08:16,689 --> 00:08:18,327
Paquita?

145
00:08:26,249 --> 00:08:28,285
His cat's gone.

146
00:08:51,969 --> 00:08:53,448
Who left the door open?

147
00:08:57,209 --> 00:09:00,167
Who left the door open?

148
00:09:06,929 --> 00:09:09,921
Come on! Come on! Help me look!

149
00:09:26,609 --> 00:09:29,567
You know, the cats,
they run away all the time.

150
00:09:29,729 --> 00:09:33,927
You know, my aunt, she had a cat,
ran away, showed up three years later.

151
00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:35,761
You never know.

152
00:09:35,929 --> 00:09:38,966
They got things in their brains.
They remember where they're from.

153
00:09:40,689 --> 00:09:44,079
Unless somebody starts feeding her.
See, that's what you gotta worry about.

154
00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:53,004
Once again, Antonio,
I can't even begin to say...

155
00:09:53,169 --> 00:09:58,197
...how deeply, deeply sorry
I am about everything.

156
00:09:58,929 --> 00:10:00,203
The job...

157
00:10:00,369 --> 00:10:01,768
...the cat...

158
00:10:05,049 --> 00:10:06,323
The lamp.

159
00:10:08,689 --> 00:10:10,805
There's wire sticking out.

160
00:10:22,169 --> 00:10:23,602
Yeah.

161
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:27,599
Here's my card.

162
00:10:27,809 --> 00:10:29,686
I'm in real estate.

163
00:10:29,849 --> 00:10:33,239
So if you're ever looking for
something bigger, something nicer...

164
00:10:34,809 --> 00:10:36,720
Maybe not right away.

165
00:10:36,889 --> 00:10:38,766
Anyway...

166
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,039
You ought to get that wire fixed.

167
00:10:50,729 --> 00:10:52,481
I got the door.

168
00:10:59,049 --> 00:11:02,439
George, stop worrying about this guy.
It wasn't your fault.

169
00:11:02,609 --> 00:11:05,487
Come on. He's not stalking you.

170
00:11:06,609 --> 00:11:07,598
- Hey.
- Hey.

171
00:11:07,929 --> 00:11:10,124
He doesn't even know where you live.

172
00:11:10,289 --> 00:11:12,962
Who told you to give him
your business card?

173
00:11:14,209 --> 00:11:15,927
That's Elaine.

174
00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:17,681
Kramer.

175
00:11:17,849 --> 00:11:20,727
George wants to know when
you wanna go look for the cat again.

176
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:24,040
Well, it's been a week.
It's up to the cat now.

177
00:11:26,489 --> 00:11:29,003
Kramer says it's up to the cat now.

178
00:11:29,169 --> 00:11:30,648
It'll be on your conscience.

179
00:11:30,969 --> 00:11:33,688
- Oh, how do you figure?
- How do you figure?

180
00:11:33,849 --> 00:11:35,441
You're the one who left
the door open.

181
00:11:35,609 --> 00:11:37,839
Why was I in charge
of closing the door?

182
00:11:38,009 --> 00:11:40,648
Why was he in charge
of closing the door?

183
00:11:40,809 --> 00:11:42,162
Because you came in after him.

184
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:44,401
- So?
- So?

185
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:47,523
- Last person in should close the door.
- Let me talk to him.

186
00:11:47,689 --> 00:11:49,759
Talk- Call him from your house.

187
00:11:50,569 --> 00:11:52,525
He's calling you now.

188
00:11:52,689 --> 00:11:54,168
Okay.

189
00:11:55,209 --> 00:11:57,006
Ed's downstairs.
Can I have the car keys?

190
00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:00,918
- No "hello"?
- You got any aspirin?

191
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,203
Hello.

192
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:06,768
Now, lookit, you guarantee me...

193
00:12:06,929 --> 00:12:09,841
...this car's gonna get me
to the airport tomorrow, no problem?

194
00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:12,079
Guarantee? Hey, it's a car.

195
00:12:12,249 --> 00:12:15,798
Because if there's even
the slightest chance of any problem...

196
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:19,120
...I don't wanna take it. If I don't
get this guy on a plane to Seattle...

197
00:12:19,289 --> 00:12:23,965
...and out of my life, I'm gonna kill him
and anyone who tries to stop me.

198
00:12:25,489 --> 00:12:27,957
So did you have
a nice week together?

199
00:12:30,809 --> 00:12:33,528
I heard a little ping in the car last time.
What was that ping?

200
00:12:33,689 --> 00:12:36,044
There's no ping.
Why are you so wacky?

201
00:12:37,489 --> 00:12:40,799
Jerry, you cannot imagine
how much I hate this guy.

202
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:44,086
And he hasn't even done anything.
It's this situation.

203
00:12:44,249 --> 00:12:47,446
He's a wonderful guy,
but I hate his guts.

204
00:12:48,489 --> 00:12:50,320
So have you two been...?

205
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:52,288
No!

206
00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:56,843
I told him I've been having my period
the last five days.

207
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:59,921
And I'm sleeping all squished
over on the edge of my bed.

208
00:13:00,089 --> 00:13:02,808
But I've only got 14 hours to go,
and nothing can go wrong now.

209
00:13:02,969 --> 00:13:05,961
I've taken care of everything.
I've confirmed the plane reservation...

210
00:13:06,129 --> 00:13:08,165
- ... checked weather-
- What's your airport route?

211
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,399
I got it all mapped out.
I'm taking the tunnel.

212
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:12,839
What about the Van Wyck?

213
00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:14,798
I spoke to a cab driver.

214
00:13:14,969 --> 00:13:18,962
For 5 bucks, he turned me onto
the Rockaway Boulevard shortcut.

215
00:13:19,369 --> 00:13:22,281
Now look, his plane leaves at 10: 15,
we're getting up at about 8.

216
00:13:22,449 --> 00:13:25,168
- Gives us enough time, right?
- You still using that alarm clock?

217
00:13:25,329 --> 00:13:28,002
No, I bought a new one today.
It's got everything.

218
00:13:28,169 --> 00:13:32,208
If you oversleep, a hand comes out
and slaps you in the face.

219
00:13:33,369 --> 00:13:36,406
Flying doesn't make me nervous.
Driving to the airport...

220
00:13:36,569 --> 00:13:39,129
...can make you very nervous.

221
00:13:39,289 --> 00:13:41,519
Because when you're flying,
getting on a plane...

222
00:13:41,689 --> 00:13:44,157
...if you miss that plane,
there's no alternative.

223
00:13:44,329 --> 00:13:45,648
On the ground, you have options.

224
00:13:45,809 --> 00:13:48,277
You have buses, you have taxis,
you have trains.

225
00:13:48,449 --> 00:13:51,441
But when you're taking a flight,
if you miss it, that's it.

226
00:13:51,609 --> 00:13:54,567
No airline goes, "Well, you missed
the flight. We do have a cannon...

227
00:13:54,729 --> 00:13:57,960
...leaving in 10 minutes.
Would you be interested in that?

228
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:02,725
It's not a direct cannon. You have
to change cannons after you land."

229
00:14:04,569 --> 00:14:06,287
"Sir, where are you going,
Chicago?

230
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:11,838
Oh, Dallas. All right. Wait a second.

231
00:14:12,049 --> 00:14:15,246
Dallas, that's about Dallas. Texas,
anyway. You should hit Texas. Ready?

232
00:14:16,729 --> 00:14:18,162
Get out of the net immediately...

233
00:14:18,329 --> 00:14:20,524
...because we shoot the luggage in
right after you."

234
00:14:30,489 --> 00:14:34,482
Get up. The alarm didn't go off.
You're gonna miss the plane, it's 9: 15.

235
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:38,244
15?
- Yeah. It's 9: 15!

236
00:14:38,409 --> 00:14:40,127
We'll never make it.
I'll leave tomorrow.

237
00:14:40,289 --> 00:14:43,042
Tomorrow? Are you crazy?
No. Now, now, let's go.

238
00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:45,006
Let's go. You get dressed,
you get dressed.

239
00:14:45,169 --> 00:14:47,763
- Can I shower?
- Shower? Are you out of your mind?

240
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:50,238
I gotta shower. I'll feel dirty all day.

241
00:14:50,409 --> 00:14:54,004
Forget the shower. The shower's out.
Just move it. Put your clothes on.

242
00:14:54,809 --> 00:14:56,288
- Where are you going?
- The kitchen.

243
00:14:56,449 --> 00:14:58,440
- The kitchen?
- Got a bag of cashews in there.

244
00:14:58,609 --> 00:15:01,407
No, they're not making it.
Here, put your pants on.

245
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:03,287
- Put your pants on.
- What's the big deal?

246
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:06,725
- I'll go tomorrow or the next day.
- No, you have your ticket.

247
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:08,686
- You have to go now.
- We'll never make it.

248
00:15:09,329 --> 00:15:13,038
- Don't say that.
- Well, it takes 45 minutes to get-

249
00:15:13,489 --> 00:15:16,561
It takes 45 minutes to get there.
That will only leave me five minutes...

250
00:15:16,729 --> 00:15:18,799
- ... to get to the plane.
- Shut up and pack!

251
00:15:18,969 --> 00:15:22,041
And what if I don't make the plane?
You'll have left. Then what do I do?

252
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:23,961
You're talking too much.

253
00:15:24,129 --> 00:15:26,120
- Where's my sweater?
- What?

254
00:15:26,329 --> 00:15:27,921
- My brown sweater.
- What sweater?

255
00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:30,319
- My brown sweater.
- You didn't bring a brown sweater.

256
00:15:30,489 --> 00:15:32,878
- I got a brown sweater.
- Here. You want a sweater?

257
00:15:33,049 --> 00:15:35,165
You want a brown sweater,
you got a brown sweater.

258
00:15:35,329 --> 00:15:38,526
- I can't take your sweater.
- It's brown!

259
00:15:40,249 --> 00:15:41,728
What are you doing?

260
00:15:41,889 --> 00:15:44,961
No. There's no time for folding,
no time for folding. I think that's it.

261
00:15:45,129 --> 00:15:47,882
- My shoes, you packed my shoes.
- Shoes? Shoes?

262
00:15:48,049 --> 00:15:50,279
Shoes weren't invented till
the fourth century.

263
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,883
People walked around
for thousands of years without them!

264
00:15:53,049 --> 00:15:55,882
I have this! Let's go. Let's go.

265
00:15:59,489 --> 00:16:01,798
- Anywhere in the city?
- Anywhere in the city.

266
00:16:01,969 --> 00:16:03,766
I'll tell you the best public toilet.

267
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:05,328
Okay...

268
00:16:05,489 --> 00:16:06,888
...54th and Sixth.

269
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:10,124
Sperry-Rand building,
14th floor, Morgan Apparel.

270
00:16:10,289 --> 00:16:12,883
Mention my name,
she'll give you the key.

271
00:16:15,289 --> 00:16:18,326
All right, 65th and 1 Oth.

272
00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:21,681
Are you kidding?

273
00:16:21,849 --> 00:16:24,602
Lincoln Center, Alice Tully Hall,
the Met.

274
00:16:24,769 --> 00:16:26,919
Magnificent facilities.

275
00:16:33,449 --> 00:16:36,088
I never knew I could drive like that.

276
00:16:36,409 --> 00:16:38,559
I was going faster
than I've ever gone before.

277
00:16:38,729 --> 00:16:41,721
And yet it all seemed
to be happening in slow motion.

278
00:16:41,889 --> 00:16:44,403
I was seeing three
and four moves ahead...

279
00:16:44,569 --> 00:16:49,518
...weaving in and out of lanes like an
Olympic skier on a gold-medal run.

280
00:16:50,329 --> 00:16:53,924
I knew I was challenging
the very laws of physics.

281
00:16:54,089 --> 00:16:57,161
At Queens Boulevard,
I took the shoulder.

282
00:16:57,369 --> 00:17:00,167
At Jewel Avenue, I used the median.

283
00:17:00,329 --> 00:17:03,765
I had it. I was there. And then...

284
00:17:05,289 --> 00:17:07,325
...I hit the Van Wyck.

285
00:17:08,489 --> 00:17:11,128
They say no one's ever beaten
the Van Wyck...

286
00:17:11,769 --> 00:17:15,284
...but, gentlemen, I tell you this:

287
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:19,683
I came as close as anyone ever has.

288
00:17:21,409 --> 00:17:26,164
And if it hadn't been
for that five-car pileup...

289
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:29,321
...on Rockaway Boulevard...

290
00:17:29,489 --> 00:17:32,242
...that numbskull...

291
00:17:32,409 --> 00:17:37,005
...would be on a plane
for Seattle right now...

292
00:17:37,169 --> 00:17:40,127
...instead of looking
for a parking space...

293
00:17:40,289 --> 00:17:42,484
...downstairs.

294
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:44,882
- You did everything.
- You tried.

295
00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:46,243
The busboy's coming.

296
00:17:46,689 --> 00:17:50,079
- The busboy's coming.
- The busboy's coming?

297
00:17:50,249 --> 00:17:52,888
- You don't mean here.
- I buzzed him in. He's on his way up.

298
00:17:53,049 --> 00:17:54,846
He's coming up?
I'll check you out later.

299
00:17:55,009 --> 00:17:56,886
- Where are you going?
- I'm the one he wants.

300
00:17:57,049 --> 00:18:00,200
- He's coming to settle the score.
- No. You three all know each other.

301
00:18:00,369 --> 00:18:02,644
There's no point in me
getting involved at this stage.

302
00:18:02,809 --> 00:18:05,767
No, he's not gonna do anything.
I guarantee it.

303
00:18:05,929 --> 00:18:08,238
The hell with it! Let him kill me, I-

304
00:18:08,689 --> 00:18:11,442
Antonio! Antonio, in here.

305
00:18:14,249 --> 00:18:16,479
Hey, Antonio, how's it going?

306
00:18:17,689 --> 00:18:19,441
Three nights ago...

307
00:18:20,209 --> 00:18:23,679
...a gas main beneath
the restaurant exploded...

308
00:18:23,849 --> 00:18:26,647
...killing five people in my section...

309
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:29,039
...including the busboy
who replaced me.

310
00:18:31,249 --> 00:18:35,003
If I'm not fired that night
because of you...

311
00:18:35,169 --> 00:18:38,639
...and your thoughtless,
stupid, insensitive remarks...

312
00:18:39,889 --> 00:18:41,368
...it would have been me.

313
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:47,247
You saved my life!

314
00:18:49,609 --> 00:18:51,088
Come on.

315
00:18:54,249 --> 00:18:56,126
- Yeah?
- It's Eddie.

316
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:59,481
- He's coming up.
- And the same night of the accident...

317
00:18:59,649 --> 00:19:01,480
...while looking for Paquita...

318
00:19:01,649 --> 00:19:03,879
...I find a job in a restaurant
where they pay me...

319
00:19:04,049 --> 00:19:06,085
...almost twice
what I was making before.

320
00:19:07,289 --> 00:19:09,962
And, when I returned
to the apartment...

321
00:19:10,129 --> 00:19:12,882
...Paquita, perhaps frightened
from the explosion...

322
00:19:13,209 --> 00:19:15,200
...had miraculously returned.

323
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:18,643
Well...

324
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:22,882
...now I must go, for today
I am starting my new, wonderful job...

325
00:19:23,049 --> 00:19:25,768
...and I am very late.

326
00:19:27,729 --> 00:19:29,208
Thank you.

327
00:19:29,609 --> 00:19:31,759
Thank you. Thank you all.

328
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:42,807
Hey, watch where you're going.
You almost knocked my head off.

329
00:19:42,969 --> 00:19:44,880
Why don't you watch
where you're going, okay?

330
00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:48,439
- Because you bumped into me.
- Who do you think you're talking to?

331
00:19:48,609 --> 00:19:51,123
Hey, get your hands off me!

332
00:19:51,289 --> 00:19:52,688
You go to hell!

333
00:20:06,129 --> 00:20:07,642
He'll get another job.

334
00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:09,363
He's a busboy.

335
00:20:09,729 --> 00:20:11,321
It won't be for a while.

336
00:20:11,489 --> 00:20:13,286
At least not till after the cast
comes off.

337
00:20:13,449 --> 00:20:15,440
That fall down the stairs,
that's what did it.

338
00:20:15,609 --> 00:20:17,042
That's not how it happened.

339
00:20:17,209 --> 00:20:19,279
It's when he fell on him
with his knee.

340
00:20:19,449 --> 00:20:22,122
That was awful. Poor Antonio.

341
00:20:23,609 --> 00:20:24,803
Thanks.

342
00:20:25,249 --> 00:20:27,444
So, much longer?

343
00:20:27,889 --> 00:20:32,485
Till when? Till he goes back to Seattle
or till he can feed himself?

344
00:20:35,489 --> 00:20:37,207
I guess it's not important.

345
00:20:40,529 --> 00:20:42,645
Take care of yourselves.

346
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:45,846
I should probably get going too.

347
00:20:46,009 --> 00:20:49,718
If I don't feed Paquita by 7,
she goes all over everything.

348
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,841
Take it easy.

349
00:20:52,009 --> 00:20:53,362
Yeah.

350
00:20:56,409 --> 00:20:57,967
How you doing?

351
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:02,962
First of all, I can't believe
that people actually do fight.

352
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:05,927
People have fistfights in life.
I can't really believe...

353
00:21:06,089 --> 00:21:08,728
...that we have boxing, either.
It's really an amazing thing.

354
00:21:09,209 --> 00:21:11,769
The problem with boxing,
you have two guys having a fight...

355
00:21:11,929 --> 00:21:13,681
...that have no prior argument.

356
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:17,642
Why don't they have the boxers
come into the ring in little cars...

357
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:20,403
...drive around a bit,
have a little accident, they get out:

358
00:21:20,569 --> 00:21:22,639
"Didn't you see my signal?
Look at that fender!"

359
00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:24,481
Then you'd see a real fight.

360
00:22:02,449 --> 00:22:04,440
