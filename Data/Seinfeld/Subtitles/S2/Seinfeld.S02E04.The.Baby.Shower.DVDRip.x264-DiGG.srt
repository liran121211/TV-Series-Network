1
00:00:02,049 --> 00:00:03,198
Men...

2
00:00:04,369 --> 00:00:07,406
...flip around the television
more than women, I think.

3
00:00:08,929 --> 00:00:10,601
Men get that remote control
in their hands...

4
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:12,725
They don't even know
what they're not watching.

5
00:00:12,889 --> 00:00:15,244
"Rerun, don't wanna watch it."
"What are you watching?"

6
00:00:15,409 --> 00:00:17,161
"Don't care.""Who was that?"
"Don't know."

7
00:00:17,329 --> 00:00:20,048
"Isn't that your father?"
"Doesn't matter, I gotta keep going."

8
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:23,559
Women don't do that.
See, now, women...

9
00:00:23,729 --> 00:00:26,926
...will stop and go,"Well,
let me see what the show is...

10
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:29,159
...before I change the channel."

11
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:31,524
You see, but men just fly.
Because women...

12
00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:34,999
You see, women nest,
and men hunt.

13
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:37,319
That's why we watch TV differently.

14
00:00:39,249 --> 00:00:43,208
Before there was flipping around,
before there was television...

15
00:00:43,369 --> 00:00:45,405
...kings and emperors
and pharaohs and such...

16
00:00:45,569 --> 00:00:47,844
...had storytellers that would
tell them stories.

17
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:49,237
That was their entertainment.

18
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:53,084
I always wonder in that era if they
would get 30 storytellers together...

19
00:00:53,249 --> 00:00:55,080
...so they could still flip around.
Just go:

20
00:00:55,249 --> 00:00:57,524
"Tell me your story.
I don't wanna hear anymore.

21
00:00:57,689 --> 00:00:59,600
Shut up. Next guy.
What are you talking about?

22
00:00:59,769 --> 00:01:01,566
Is there a girl in that story?
No? Shut up.

23
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:03,606
What have you got?
I don't wanna hear that.

24
00:01:03,769 --> 00:01:05,805
What are you talking about?
Don't wanna hear it.

25
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:08,437
Now, the whole of you,
get out of here. I'm going to bed."

26
00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:15,448
She's pregnant?

27
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:19,598
Leslie is pregnant?
Oh, see, there is no justice.

28
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:21,327
She's the performance artist, right?

29
00:01:21,489 --> 00:01:24,447
Yeah, performance artist.
She's a performer, a real trouper.

30
00:01:24,729 --> 00:01:27,243
What's her husband's name again?
Chip?

31
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:28,637
Kip?

32
00:01:28,849 --> 00:01:30,077
Skip?

33
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:32,645
- Todd.
- Todd.

34
00:01:32,809 --> 00:01:34,800
Oh, yeah.

35
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:36,721
- He's a Kennedy.
- No, he's not.

36
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:40,165
- Come on, he's a third cousin.
- By marriage.

37
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:42,924
Oh, by marriage, yeah.
We went to the wedding.

38
00:01:43,089 --> 00:01:45,000
Should've heard them talk
about Chappaquiddick.

39
00:01:45,169 --> 00:01:47,729
Tried to blame the whole thing
on bad directions.

40
00:01:47,889 --> 00:01:50,449
That woman was unequivocally
the worst date of my life.

41
00:01:51,169 --> 00:01:55,367
Pardon me for setting you up
with a beautiful, intelligent woman.

42
00:01:55,529 --> 00:01:58,441
What, you don't think I can attract
beautiful, intelligent women?

43
00:01:58,609 --> 00:02:02,284
Thin ice, George, very thin ice.

44
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:05,601
Maybe for her new performance
piece, she'll give birth on-stage.

45
00:02:06,449 --> 00:02:07,962
She stopped performing.

46
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:10,927
What a huge blow to the culture.

47
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:14,286
You believe this guy?
He holds a grudge like Khomeini.

48
00:02:14,449 --> 00:02:16,121
She dragged me down
to that warehouse...

49
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:19,361
...on the waterfront in Brooklyn
to see one of her performances.

50
00:02:19,729 --> 00:02:22,880
Oh, and she's on-stage cooking
dinner for some celebrity?

51
00:02:23,369 --> 00:02:24,643
God.

52
00:02:24,809 --> 00:02:26,959
She's cooking dinner for God.

53
00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:29,006
She's yelling,
and the next thing I know...

54
00:02:29,169 --> 00:02:32,525
...she throws a big can of chocolate
syrup all over my new red shirt.

55
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:34,919
- It was an accident.
- Oh, yeah, accident, right.

56
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:37,649
She was aiming at me,
like she was putting out a fire.

57
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:41,201
So for the rest of the show I'm sitting
there with chocolate all over me.

58
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:43,837
Flies are landing on me.

59
00:02:44,009 --> 00:02:47,081
I'm boiling, I'm fantasizing
all the things I'm gonna say to her.

60
00:02:47,249 --> 00:02:49,319
Later, finally, backstage,
when I talk to her...

61
00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:51,445
...I'm like a little grovelling worm:

62
00:02:51,609 --> 00:02:53,725
"What kind of chocolate was that?"

63
00:02:53,889 --> 00:02:56,039
"Do you throw any other foods?"
You know...

64
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:57,528
He thought he still had a shot.

65
00:02:58,449 --> 00:03:01,043
Then, then, then...

66
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:03,040
...she leaves with somebody else.

67
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:05,801
Never even-
Never even said goodbye.

68
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:08,278
Never called me back.
Never apologized. Nothing.

69
00:03:08,449 --> 00:03:10,201
Like I was dirt.

70
00:03:11,249 --> 00:03:13,285
What ever happened with the shirt?

71
00:03:14,329 --> 00:03:15,557
I still have it.

72
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:18,647
The collar's okay.
I wear it under sweaters.

73
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:20,888
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

74
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:23,085
She asked me to give her
a baby shower.

75
00:03:23,249 --> 00:03:25,763
Asked you?
You're not gonna do that, are you?

76
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:29,326
Anyone else, never.
But Leslie...

77
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:31,081
I have a problem saying no to her.

78
00:03:31,249 --> 00:03:33,319
For some reason,
I seem to want her approval.

79
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:36,447
Let Maria Shriver
give her a baby shower.

80
00:03:36,609 --> 00:03:39,077
Ask not what I can do for you,
ask what you can do for me.

81
00:03:39,249 --> 00:03:40,398
Ich bin ein sucker.

82
00:03:41,969 --> 00:03:43,880
Would you two stop
with the Kennedys?

83
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:46,802
Why does everyone make such
a big deal about the Kennedys?

84
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:51,201
I mean, what is this fascination?
Who cares? It's all so boring.

85
00:03:51,369 --> 00:03:53,246
Look, she doesn't deserve
a baby shower.

86
00:03:53,409 --> 00:03:56,845
She deserves a baby monsoon.
She deserves Rosemary's baby.

87
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:02,242
I do have one teeny
little problem, though.

88
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:05,048
Never said goodbye.
Never apologized. Nothing.

89
00:04:07,369 --> 00:04:11,760
See, I was gonna give
the shower in my apartment...

90
00:04:11,929 --> 00:04:14,841
- But?
- My roommate has Lyme disease.

91
00:04:15,009 --> 00:04:17,728
Lyme disease? I thought she had
Epstein-Barr syndrome.

92
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:20,449
She has this in addition
to Epstein-Barr.

93
00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:23,999
It's like Epstein-Barr
with a twist of Lyme disease.

94
00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:27,366
- How'd she get Lyme disease?
- I don't know.

95
00:04:27,529 --> 00:04:30,805
She did some outdoor version of Hair
in Danbury, Connecticut.

96
00:04:30,969 --> 00:04:33,278
- They still do that play?
- It's a classic.

97
00:04:33,609 --> 00:04:35,406
- With the nudity?
- I guess.

98
00:04:36,049 --> 00:04:39,246
She must've rolled over
on a tick during the love-in.

99
00:04:41,809 --> 00:04:44,721
Never said goodbye. Goodbye.

100
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:47,679
Explain to me how
this baby shower thing works.

101
00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:49,483
What do you want to know?

102
00:04:49,649 --> 00:04:53,164
Well, I mean does it ever erupt
into a drunken orgy of violence?

103
00:04:54,649 --> 00:04:56,207
Rarely.

104
00:04:56,369 --> 00:04:59,884
There's no hazing of the foetus
or anything, is there?

105
00:05:01,329 --> 00:05:02,842
No.

106
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:04,965
- When is this supposed to be?
- Saturday.

107
00:05:05,129 --> 00:05:08,883
Saturday. Well, I have a show
in Buffalo on Saturday.

108
00:05:09,049 --> 00:05:11,085
They're not gonna bust up
my apartment, are they?

109
00:05:11,249 --> 00:05:13,001
No, I'll take full responsibility.

110
00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:14,682
Because I've seen pregnant women...

111
00:05:14,849 --> 00:05:17,204
...and they sometimes
misjudge their foetal girth.

112
00:05:17,369 --> 00:05:18,563
And they'll...

113
00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:22,324
Just, like, one wrong turn, the whole
buffet is, like, right off the table.

114
00:05:22,929 --> 00:05:25,489
Someday, before I die,
mark my words...

115
00:05:25,649 --> 00:05:27,844
...I'm gonna tell that woman
what I think of her.

116
00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:30,728
I'll never be able
to forgive myself until I do.

117
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:32,925
- And if you do?
- I still won't forgive myself...

118
00:05:33,089 --> 00:05:35,398
...but at least it won't be about this.

119
00:05:44,049 --> 00:05:46,324
What are you doing this for?
Look at you.

120
00:05:46,489 --> 00:05:49,162
- Quiet. I'm trying to get a picture.
- But you don't have to.

121
00:05:49,329 --> 00:05:52,002
- The guy is waiting in my house.
- Leave me alone.

122
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:54,478
It's a one-time fee, 150 bucks.

123
00:05:54,649 --> 00:05:58,085
- Why live like this?
- I'm not getting illegal cable.

124
00:05:58,689 --> 00:06:02,443
So you're gonna wait for the cable
companies to resolve their dispute?

125
00:06:02,769 --> 00:06:04,043
They'll be in court for years.

126
00:06:04,209 --> 00:06:05,961
- I read in the paper-
- Oh, the paper...

127
00:06:06,129 --> 00:06:09,360
- They might hook us up again.
- Oh, God. You're so naive.

128
00:06:09,529 --> 00:06:13,158
All the cable companies care about
is the big"mamoo."

129
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:18,279
Look at you. You're banging things.
You're just pathetic.

130
00:06:18,529 --> 00:06:20,679
Just wasting your life.

131
00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:23,409
I'm offering you 56 channels.

132
00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:28,563
Movies, sports, nudity,
and it's free for life!

133
00:06:28,849 --> 00:06:30,760
Stop shouting.
You're ruining the reception.

134
00:06:30,929 --> 00:06:32,726
Can you hear yourself?
Can-?

135
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:35,119
Do you know what you're saying?

136
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:38,565
- What you're suggesting is illegal.
- It's not illegal.

137
00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:41,562
- It's against the law.
- Well, yeah.

138
00:06:44,369 --> 00:06:46,360
Just hold this.
Can you hold that?

139
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:48,997
Look, will you at least
let me bring the guy over?

140
00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:51,444
He's an amazing man.
He's a Russian immigrant.

141
00:06:51,609 --> 00:06:53,201
He escaped from the Gulag.

142
00:06:53,369 --> 00:06:56,327
He's like the Sakharov of cable guys.

143
00:06:56,689 --> 00:06:59,806
He'll slow down your gas meter.
He sells slugs, Jerry.

144
00:06:59,969 --> 00:07:02,722
Slugs for the subway.

145
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:05,528
- He's a real human-rights nut, huh?
- Yeah.

146
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:07,208
He's intense, man.

147
00:07:07,729 --> 00:07:09,082
I don't know.

148
00:07:09,249 --> 00:07:11,558
- What if I get caught?
- You're not gonna get caught.

149
00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:15,927
Let me get him in. It's the '90s.
It's Hammer Time. Come on.

150
00:07:16,089 --> 00:07:17,886
Just let me get him.

151
00:07:18,049 --> 00:07:20,358
Jerry, Jerry,
this is the cable man.

152
00:07:23,849 --> 00:07:25,646
You know, why don't we wait...

153
00:07:25,809 --> 00:07:27,720
...because I'm going
out of town tomorrow...

154
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:29,720
Tomorrow okay.

155
00:07:29,969 --> 00:07:32,199
No problem. You'll have
the whole thing installed...

156
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:33,518
...by the time you get back.

157
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:36,920
No, every time I turn on a TV,
sirens are gonna go off.

158
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:39,444
They're gonna track me down
like a dog, I know it.

159
00:07:39,609 --> 00:07:42,601
Look, now, Jerry, it's no risk.
I swear.

160
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:46,763
The Mets have 75 games
on cable this year.

161
00:07:51,049 --> 00:07:52,243
Put it in.

162
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:53,643
You won't regret it.

163
00:07:53,809 --> 00:07:58,280
Yeah, Jerry's gonna be a cab/e boy
A cab/e boy, a cab/e boy

164
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,809
- Mr. Steinfeld?
- Seinfeld.

165
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:08,962
We're with the FBl. You wanna
tell us about your cable hookup?

166
00:08:09,969 --> 00:08:11,561
My cable hookup?
What about it?

167
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:13,481
It's been illegally installed.

168
00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:16,323
It has? I've been out of town.
How did you know?

169
00:08:17,089 --> 00:08:21,640
Jerry, I had to tell them.
I had to. I had no choice.

170
00:08:22,089 --> 00:08:24,842
They were onto the scam
from the very beginning.

171
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:27,045
You're in very serious trouble,
Mr. Steinfeld.

172
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:29,928
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Hold on. We're just patsies.

173
00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:32,364
We're just a couple of users.
We never sold the stuff.

174
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:35,248
What about the Russian guy?
The Russian guy's the guy you want.

175
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:39,038
Mr. Seinfeld? Agent Stone,
FBl undercover.

176
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:44,966
No, Jerry!

177
00:09:01,169 --> 00:09:02,921
No!

178
00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:08,881
Cable boy?

179
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,926
Cable boy?

180
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:16,360
What have you done
to my little cable boy?

181
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,726
Excuse me, could I get
something to drink?

182
00:09:24,889 --> 00:09:26,607
I'm afraid not.

183
00:09:28,249 --> 00:09:30,604
What's with this airline?
You're cutting out the drinks?

184
00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:34,406
No, sir, we're flying into a blizzard.
Please fasten your seat belt.

185
00:09:34,569 --> 00:09:36,207
We're making an emergency landing.

186
00:09:38,889 --> 00:09:41,357
Are they gonna go over
the instructions again?

187
00:09:42,729 --> 00:09:44,924
My name is Bill.

188
00:09:45,089 --> 00:09:48,684
I might be the last person
you ever see.

189
00:09:55,249 --> 00:09:58,127
I'm not afraid of flying, although
many people do have fear of flying.

190
00:09:58,449 --> 00:10:01,486
And I have no argument with that.
I think fear of flying...

191
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:05,005
...is quite rational,
because human beings cannot fly.

192
00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:10,280
Humans have fear of flying,
same way fish have fear of driving.

193
00:10:11,409 --> 00:10:15,641
You put a fish behind the wheel,
and they go,"This isn't right.

194
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:18,885
I shouldn't be doing this.

195
00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:21,565
I don't belong here."

196
00:10:24,369 --> 00:10:25,961
- Sounds like a rough trip.
- Well...

197
00:10:26,129 --> 00:10:28,848
...there were fire engines and
ambulances all on the runway.

198
00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:32,524
And then when we landed safely,
they all seemed so disappointed.

199
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:34,442
So the college cancelled the gig?

200
00:10:34,609 --> 00:10:36,565
There was so much snow,
the roads were closed.

201
00:10:36,729 --> 00:10:38,959
I really appreciate
you picking me up. Thanks again.

202
00:10:39,169 --> 00:10:41,888
- Forget it.
- No, really, an airport run.

203
00:10:42,049 --> 00:10:43,482
It's nothing.

204
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:46,322
It's one thing if I asked you,
"Could you do me a favour?"

205
00:10:46,489 --> 00:10:47,683
But to suggest it...

206
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:50,598
When you told me what
you went through on the plane...

207
00:10:50,769 --> 00:10:52,521
...it makes you stop and think.

208
00:10:52,849 --> 00:10:55,044
I appreciate having a real friend.

209
00:10:55,209 --> 00:10:57,165
If Richie Brandis did this,
I'd be suspicious.

210
00:10:57,329 --> 00:10:59,763
You know how he's always got
some ulterior motive?

211
00:11:00,609 --> 00:11:02,600
Ulterior motive...

212
00:11:03,569 --> 00:11:05,764
Wait a minute. Don't take
the bridge. Get off here.

213
00:11:05,929 --> 00:11:08,443
We can't go back to my place.
Elaine's having the shower.

214
00:11:08,609 --> 00:11:12,318
- What, tonight? Now?
- Yeah. Yeah, I forgot all about it.

215
00:11:12,489 --> 00:11:14,286
No big deal.
We'll go back to your place.

216
00:11:14,449 --> 00:11:18,078
My place? No, no. I hate my place.
I don't wanna go back to my place.

217
00:11:18,249 --> 00:11:19,728
Well, you wanna get a bite?

218
00:11:19,889 --> 00:11:23,120
Well, yeah, I would. It's just that
I just ate a whole pot roast.

219
00:11:25,489 --> 00:11:27,400
Well, so, what should we do?

220
00:11:28,449 --> 00:11:31,202
You know, shouldn't we
at least drop off your bag?

221
00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:36,598
Red shirt! Red shirt!
That's the red shirt!

222
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:39,602
- What are you talking about?
- You're wearing the chocolate shirt!

223
00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:41,805
I am. What a strange coincidence.

224
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:47,240
Nice try, my friend, but you gotta
get up pretty early in the morning.

225
00:11:47,409 --> 00:11:48,683
You gotta let me go over there.

226
00:11:48,849 --> 00:11:52,205
What, you're gonna badger a pregnant
woman at her own baby shower?

227
00:11:52,369 --> 00:11:54,963
You're gonna take it off and
make her rinse it in club soda?

228
00:11:55,129 --> 00:11:57,962
No. I'm gonna hold it under her nose
so she can smell the scent...

229
00:11:58,129 --> 00:12:00,597
...of stale Bosco that I had
to live with for three years.

230
00:12:00,769 --> 00:12:03,329
Then I'm gonna say,"Remember
this shirt, baby? Well, now...

231
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:04,717
...it's payback time!"

232
00:12:09,249 --> 00:12:11,365
We just bought an apartment
on Riverside Drive.

233
00:12:11,569 --> 00:12:14,367
Bernard Goetz's mother
used to live there.

234
00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:18,601
- So where's Todd?
- Up in Hyannisport.

235
00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:21,881
Oh, my God, Hyannisport?
With the Kennedys?

236
00:12:22,049 --> 00:12:25,166
Who else is up there?
Is Rose up there?

237
00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:29,283
- So when's your due date?
- March 20th, 9 a. m.

238
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:32,247
- You know the time?
- I'm having a planned C-section.

239
00:12:32,409 --> 00:12:36,084
My therapist told me if I go
through labour, I might get psychotic.

240
00:12:36,249 --> 00:12:39,161
Leslie, Leslie, what ever
happened to Sargent Shriver?

241
00:12:39,329 --> 00:12:42,048
Is he still with them? You don't hear
much about him these days.

242
00:12:42,209 --> 00:12:45,007
Is he, like, out of the loop, or...?

243
00:12:45,489 --> 00:12:48,526
Elaine, who catered this, Sears?

244
00:12:54,409 --> 00:12:56,479
What is this?
What are you doing here?

245
00:12:56,649 --> 00:12:58,287
- We're putting in the cable.
- The cable?

246
00:12:58,449 --> 00:13:00,644
No, I'm having a party here.
You can't do this now.

247
00:13:00,809 --> 00:13:03,323
Oh, we have to do this now.

248
00:13:03,489 --> 00:13:05,878
- Who is this guy?
- Which one?

249
00:13:06,049 --> 00:13:09,007
- Both of them.
- They're Soviet cable guys.

250
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:10,888
Okay. Does Jerry know about this?

251
00:13:11,049 --> 00:13:13,324
Oh, yeah, yeah.
It's all authorized. Yeah.

252
00:13:13,489 --> 00:13:16,561
- You can't. You can't do this now!
- Elaine...

253
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:19,084
Do you know how booked up
this guy is?

254
00:13:19,249 --> 00:13:22,764
If I send him away now, it's gonna take
Jerry months to get him back.

255
00:13:22,929 --> 00:13:24,123
He won't like that.

256
00:13:24,649 --> 00:13:27,402
All right. Just do it fast,
and then get out.

257
00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:30,887
Anatole? Giddap. Go.

258
00:13:33,089 --> 00:13:34,681
It's only gonna take
a few minutes.

259
00:13:34,849 --> 00:13:36,680
Then you and the gals
can take a load off...

260
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:39,124
...and watch something on Lifetime.

261
00:13:43,249 --> 00:13:45,843
What if we go up there,
what are you gonna say to her?

262
00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:48,398
- What am I gonna say?
- Yeah.

263
00:13:50,249 --> 00:13:52,160
"What did you go out
with me for?

264
00:13:52,329 --> 00:13:56,368
Just to dump chocolate on my shirt,
and then dump me altogether?

265
00:13:56,529 --> 00:13:58,918
I don't deserve
that kind of treatment.

266
00:13:59,409 --> 00:14:03,448
You don't have the common courtesy
to return my calls? To apologize?

267
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:07,807
You think I'm some sort of a loser
that likes to be abused and ignored?

268
00:14:07,969 --> 00:14:11,405
Whose shirt can be ruined
without financial restitution?

269
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,562
Some sort of a masochist
who enjoys being humiliated?

270
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:18,563
You think you can just avoid me
like I have some disease?

271
00:14:18,729 --> 00:14:20,959
You have the disease!
You have the disease!

272
00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:23,848
You may be beautiful and
rich and physically...

273
00:14:24,009 --> 00:14:25,806
...just unbelievable,
but you sicken me.

274
00:14:25,969 --> 00:14:29,325
You disgust me.
You and everyone like you."

275
00:14:30,409 --> 00:14:33,321
- You'll never say that to her face.
- Watch me.

276
00:14:33,489 --> 00:14:38,119
Yeah, I eat the whole apple.
Core, stem, seeds, just everything.

277
00:14:39,969 --> 00:14:41,641
Kramer. Kramer, look at him.

278
00:14:41,809 --> 00:14:45,563
- Look. He's eating all the food.
- Yeah, yeah.

279
00:14:45,729 --> 00:14:47,685
Well, you know,
there are many differences...

280
00:14:47,849 --> 00:14:50,807
...between American and Soviet
cultures that you're not aware of.

281
00:14:51,569 --> 00:14:55,642
See, in Russia, the cable guy,
they got the whole run of the house.

282
00:14:55,809 --> 00:14:57,800
Yeah, that's tradition.

283
00:14:58,929 --> 00:15:01,443
You ever eat the bark
off of a pineapple?

284
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,605
- Kramer! Kramer!
- Excuse me.

285
00:15:09,169 --> 00:15:10,397
Wow, man!

286
00:15:23,929 --> 00:15:26,363
What are you doing here?
I thought you were out of town.

287
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:28,406
The show was cancelled.
There was a blizzard.

288
00:15:28,569 --> 00:15:31,720
I can't believe you told Kramer
to install cable during the shower.

289
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:34,642
Jerry, look, look.
They've eaten everything.

290
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:36,879
Jerry, what a surprise.
I thought you'd left town.

291
00:15:37,129 --> 00:15:40,519
Well, Leslie, sometimes
the road less travelled...

292
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,247
...is less travelled for a reason.

293
00:15:45,169 --> 00:15:49,606
George, don't even think about it.
Don't even dream about it.

294
00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:51,248
- About what?
- Kramer!

295
00:16:08,489 --> 00:16:09,968
Leslie.

296
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:12,157
Yeah?

297
00:16:12,969 --> 00:16:14,482
George.

298
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:18,761
George Costanza.

299
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:21,401
Hi.

300
00:16:25,969 --> 00:16:28,324
I guess you don't remember me...

301
00:16:28,489 --> 00:16:31,925
...but we actually went out
a couple years ago...

302
00:16:32,089 --> 00:16:35,047
...once. Remember?

303
00:16:35,249 --> 00:16:36,568
- Vaguely.
- Yeah.

304
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:39,562
You took me to see one
of your shows.

305
00:16:40,689 --> 00:16:42,441
And?

306
00:16:42,809 --> 00:16:44,800
And...

307
00:16:45,329 --> 00:16:47,206
...it was quite good.

308
00:16:47,369 --> 00:16:51,760
In fact, you even incorporated me
into the show.

309
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:55,717
I'm not actually a performer,
although my parents felt I had talent-

310
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,607
Jerry?

311
00:16:57,969 --> 00:16:59,766
Remember me?

312
00:17:00,569 --> 00:17:03,879
- I'm sorry...
- Mary Contardi. No?

313
00:17:04,049 --> 00:17:06,927
Doesn't ring a bell, Jerry?
We had a date three years ago.

314
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:08,807
You took me to one of your shows.

315
00:17:09,169 --> 00:17:11,558
- I think I remember.
- Told me you had a great time.

316
00:17:11,729 --> 00:17:14,289
- Said you'd call me the next day.
- I'm sure I meant to call.

317
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:16,201
- I probably just lost your-
- Liar!

318
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,597
Liar!

319
00:17:17,769 --> 00:17:19,282
You were never going to call me.

320
00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:22,486
You thought you could waltz through
life and never bump into me again.

321
00:17:22,649 --> 00:17:25,004
But you were wrong, Jerry.
You were wrong.

322
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:28,324
What do you think?
I'm some poor pathetic wretch?

323
00:17:28,489 --> 00:17:30,798
- I didn't think that.
- To be dismissed and ignored.

324
00:17:30,969 --> 00:17:32,368
Some insignificant piece of dust?

325
00:17:32,529 --> 00:17:34,838
Some person who doesn't
deserve respect and attention?

326
00:17:35,009 --> 00:17:37,842
Well, you're the one who doesn't
deserve my respect and attention!

327
00:17:38,009 --> 00:17:40,842
You're the insignificant piece of dust!

328
00:17:49,009 --> 00:17:51,523
Actually, I never had
any formal training.

329
00:17:51,689 --> 00:17:54,806
I guess I'd be better suited
for improvs or something-

330
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:57,606
Thanks a lot.

331
00:18:02,089 --> 00:18:03,568
Oh, bye.

332
00:18:03,969 --> 00:18:07,245
- Oh, I'm so sorry you have to go.
- Yeah, I really have to be going.

333
00:18:07,769 --> 00:18:10,727
All right, listen. I've changed my mind.
I don't want the cable.

334
00:18:11,329 --> 00:18:13,160
- Jerry, don't be a fool.
- You don't want?

335
00:18:13,329 --> 00:18:16,048
No, I don't want. Tell me what
I owe you for your trouble...

336
00:18:22,529 --> 00:18:23,723
Four hundred dollars.

337
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:30,119
Four hundred dollars.

338
00:18:30,369 --> 00:18:32,200
You told me 150.

339
00:18:32,769 --> 00:18:34,725
Oh, well...

340
00:18:38,129 --> 00:18:40,199
I'm going. Obviously.

341
00:18:40,689 --> 00:18:44,238
Oh, Leslie, I am so sorry about
everything that went on here tonight.

342
00:18:44,409 --> 00:18:45,603
- I had no idea-
- Elaine...

343
00:18:45,769 --> 00:18:48,124
...I was watching you tonight,
and I realized something.

344
00:18:48,289 --> 00:18:49,802
You're just like you were
in college.

345
00:18:50,849 --> 00:18:52,840
Thank you.

346
00:18:55,249 --> 00:18:57,479
What was I like in college?

347
00:18:58,729 --> 00:19:00,447
Come on, let's go.

348
00:19:10,329 --> 00:19:11,887
Be right back.

349
00:19:14,009 --> 00:19:18,321
I'm not paying $400.
I don't even want the thing.

350
00:19:18,849 --> 00:19:20,487
What are you gonna do?

351
00:19:29,089 --> 00:19:31,683
Every woman on the face
of the earth...

352
00:19:31,849 --> 00:19:34,761
...has complete control of my life...

353
00:19:35,929 --> 00:19:38,204
...and yet I want them all.

354
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,846
Is that irony?

355
00:19:41,969 --> 00:19:44,722
Why can't I meet a Kennedy?

356
00:19:45,689 --> 00:19:49,079
I saw John Jr. once downtown.
I was on a bus.

357
00:19:49,249 --> 00:19:50,807
I hit the...

358
00:19:50,969 --> 00:19:52,561
...ding.

359
00:19:53,209 --> 00:19:55,086
It didn't stop.

360
00:19:56,089 --> 00:19:59,161
All right. I said I had
a good time and I'd call...

361
00:19:59,329 --> 00:20:01,604
...but who takes that literally?

362
00:20:02,529 --> 00:20:05,646
Hey, come on over. Doctor Zhivago's
on cable in five minutes.

363
00:20:07,409 --> 00:20:09,479
I'm making popcorn!

364
00:20:11,849 --> 00:20:16,047
What do you do at the end
of a date when you know...

365
00:20:16,209 --> 00:20:20,521
...you don't want to see this person
ever again for the rest of your life?

366
00:20:20,689 --> 00:20:22,964
What do you say? What do you say?

367
00:20:23,129 --> 00:20:26,565
It doesn't-
No matter what you say, it's a lie.

368
00:20:27,449 --> 00:20:29,405
"I'll see you around.

369
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:32,120
See you around.

370
00:20:32,849 --> 00:20:35,238
If you're around and I'm around...

371
00:20:35,849 --> 00:20:38,807
...I'll see you around that area.

372
00:20:39,569 --> 00:20:42,925
You'll be around other people,
you won't be around me...

373
00:20:43,089 --> 00:20:45,523
...but you will be around.

374
00:20:46,649 --> 00:20:48,367
Take care now."

375
00:20:48,529 --> 00:20:51,680
You ever say that to somebody?
"Take care now.

376
00:20:52,889 --> 00:20:56,279
Take care... now.

377
00:20:57,369 --> 00:21:00,008
Because I'm not gonna be
taking care of you...

378
00:21:00,169 --> 00:21:03,366
...so you should take care now."

379
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:07,238
"Take care, take care."
What does that mean?"Take care."

380
00:21:07,409 --> 00:21:10,287
"Take off."Isn't that what
you really wanna say?

381
00:21:10,449 --> 00:21:12,360
"Take off now.

382
00:21:13,129 --> 00:21:14,881
Get out of here."

383
00:22:01,769 --> 00:22:03,760
