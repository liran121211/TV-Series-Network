1
00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:04,878
Give me an explanation
why the pharmacist has to be...

2
00:00:07,489 --> 00:00:10,765
...two and a half feet up
above everybody else.

3
00:00:11,089 --> 00:00:14,718
What the hell is he doing he can't be
on the floor with you and me?

4
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:18,598
Brain surgeons, airline pilots, nuclear
physicists, we're on the same level.

5
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:21,966
Oh, no, he's gotta be
two and a half feet up.

6
00:00:22,129 --> 00:00:25,485
"Look out, everybody,
I'm working with pills.

7
00:00:25,809 --> 00:00:27,720
Spread out, give me some room."

8
00:00:28,249 --> 00:00:30,888
The only hard part of his whole job
that I could see...

9
00:00:31,089 --> 00:00:33,808
...is typing everything
onto that little, tiny label.

10
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:36,849
And has to try and get
all the words on there...

11
00:00:37,009 --> 00:00:40,445
...keep the little piece of paper
in the roller of the typewriter.

12
00:00:40,609 --> 00:00:43,567
Oh, no. He's gotta be
two and a half feet up.

13
00:00:43,729 --> 00:00:47,847
"Yeah, I'd like to get this
prescription filled."

14
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:51,365
"All right. You wait down there.

15
00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:53,241
Only I'm allowed up here."

16
00:00:59,569 --> 00:01:01,764
- Where'd you meet her?
- I met her on an elevator.

17
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:04,648
On an elevator?
You met a woman on an elevator?

18
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:07,562
- Impossible, right?
- You got less than 60 seconds.

19
00:01:07,729 --> 00:01:10,084
That's like dismantling a time bomb.

20
00:01:10,449 --> 00:01:13,088
- What got into you?
- I don't know. She was so beautiful...

21
00:01:13,249 --> 00:01:14,967
...it was a pure reflex. The words...

22
00:01:15,129 --> 00:01:17,962
- ... just came out of my mouth.
- Wow. What did you say?

23
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:23,244
You know, I'm the one responsible
for those crop circles in England.

24
00:01:25,609 --> 00:01:27,804
- Can you believe I did that?
- What did she say?

25
00:01:27,969 --> 00:01:29,960
What crop circles?

26
00:01:31,729 --> 00:01:34,004
- Not a good sign.
- Not everybody knows...

27
00:01:34,169 --> 00:01:37,161
...what the crop circles are.
You know what the crop circles are?

28
00:01:37,329 --> 00:01:39,399
Crop circles?
Why don't you buy something?

29
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:41,328
You got something in your teeth.

30
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:43,487
- What?
- It's green.

31
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:47,642
Oh, man, spinach. I've been
walking around like this all afternoon.

32
00:01:47,809 --> 00:01:51,438
- You bump into anybody you knew?
- I had a job interview.

33
00:01:51,849 --> 00:01:54,124
- How did it go?
- Take a guess.

34
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:57,326
Well, Mr. Costanza, we have nothing
available at the present time...

35
00:01:57,489 --> 00:01:59,684
...but should anything open up,
we'll be in touch.

36
00:02:00,089 --> 00:02:01,886
Okay, thanks.

37
00:02:03,009 --> 00:02:04,681
You don't need a job.
You got Audrey.

38
00:02:04,849 --> 00:02:06,601
Yeah. Right.

39
00:02:07,329 --> 00:02:09,240
- What's the matter?
- No. Nothing.

40
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,999
- What?
- You won't think I'm a bad person?

41
00:02:12,329 --> 00:02:13,808
Too late for that.

42
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:17,723
Because, believe me, I would only say
this to you and maybe a psychiatrist.

43
00:02:18,089 --> 00:02:19,602
What is it?

44
00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:21,202
Well...

45
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,606
Her nose is a little big.

46
00:02:26,249 --> 00:02:27,568
Yeah, she's got a big nose.

47
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:31,044
I mean, big would even be okay.

48
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:32,797
It's beyond big.

49
00:02:34,249 --> 00:02:36,046
It's a schnoz.

50
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:38,760
I'm aware that my own
physical dimensions...

51
00:02:38,929 --> 00:02:41,568
- ... are a little short of perfection.
- A little.

52
00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:43,964
Who am I to be thinking
about someone's nose?

53
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:48,202
I should be grateful someone like her
looks at me. I have no job, nothing.

54
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:50,646
But I have to say,
I think about the nose.

55
00:02:51,169 --> 00:02:54,764
I don't wanna think about it, I don't ask
to think about it, but I think about it.

56
00:02:54,929 --> 00:02:58,888
I go to bed, I tell myself, "Don't
think about the nose."I think about it.

57
00:02:59,089 --> 00:03:01,967
I look at her, I see the nose.

58
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:05,244
Stop being so concerned with looks.

59
00:03:12,809 --> 00:03:16,358
- Have you said anything to her?
- No. Could never do that.

60
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,565
The ironic thing is,
if she had a smaller nose...

61
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:22,802
...I never could've dated her. She'd be
out of my league with a smaller nose.

62
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:26,361
And I really like her. I know that.

63
00:03:26,529 --> 00:03:28,485
And I know one other thing:

64
00:03:28,969 --> 00:03:31,005
I'm not getting past that nose.

65
00:03:32,529 --> 00:03:34,201
All right, shut up. Here they come.

66
00:03:34,809 --> 00:03:37,403
How can I not think about it?
Look at the size of this thing.

67
00:03:39,249 --> 00:03:43,322
My mother's going out with this guy
who leaves a jacket in her house.

68
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:47,607
She gives to me. Well, two years later,
he shows up and takes it back.

69
00:03:47,969 --> 00:03:51,484
Now he's in prison.
Got arrested for mail fraud.

70
00:03:51,929 --> 00:03:56,445
So, Elaine, go over to the apartment,
tell the landlord you're his daughter...

71
00:03:56,609 --> 00:03:58,361
...and you wanna bring him
the jacket.

72
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:00,997
Won't the landlord know
I'm not the daughter?

73
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:03,558
No, he's never met her.
She's in California.

74
00:04:04,689 --> 00:04:08,045
- Are you coming with me?
- Yeah, I have to. I'm your fiancé.

75
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:12,007
Peter Von Nostrand.

76
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,205
Why don't you just
commit yourself already?

77
00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:17,087
What is so special
about this jacket?

78
00:04:17,249 --> 00:04:19,444
- No, you don't wanna know.
- God...

79
00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:23,568
He believes it possesses some
extraordinary power over women.

80
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:25,481
What's that splotch on your hand?

81
00:04:25,649 --> 00:04:28,482
I got stamped at the
reggae lounge last night.

82
00:04:28,649 --> 00:04:31,959
I'm going back there tonight. I'm not
gonna pay another cover charge.

83
00:04:33,369 --> 00:04:34,688
You didn't wash all day?

84
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:38,046
Yeah, I washed. Just not the hand.

85
00:04:39,809 --> 00:04:42,642
You wouldn't believe the women
at this club. Man.

86
00:04:42,929 --> 00:04:45,648
It's amazing how many
beautiful women live in New York.

87
00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:47,726
I actually find it kind of intimidating.

88
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:50,608
You're as pretty as any of them.
Just need a nose job.

89
00:04:56,969 --> 00:04:59,563
- Kramer!
- What? What?

90
00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:01,799
How could you say
something like that?

91
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:04,199
What do you mean?
I just said she needs a nose job.

92
00:05:04,369 --> 00:05:07,167
No, no. There's nothing wrong
with her nose.

93
00:05:07,329 --> 00:05:10,048
- God, I'm so sorry, Audrey.
- Oh, it's okay.

94
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:13,485
- What did you have to say that for?
- I was just trying to help out.

95
00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:18,441
Yeah, well, you can kiss that jacket
goodbye, Mr. Von Nausen.

96
00:05:20,329 --> 00:05:22,365
You see what happens
when you try to be nice?

97
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:25,925
But what would the world be like...

98
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:28,245
...if people said whatever
they were thinking...

99
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:31,084
...all the time,
whenever it came to them?

100
00:05:31,409 --> 00:05:34,446
How long would a blind date last?

101
00:05:34,609 --> 00:05:36,520
About 13 seconds, I think.

102
00:05:36,929 --> 00:05:39,682
"Sorry, your rear end is too big."
"Okay, your breath stinks."

103
00:05:39,849 --> 00:05:42,807
"See you later. No problem. Goodbye."
"Okay, thank you very much."

104
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:46,287
Elaine said I can stay with her
another month till Tina gets back.

105
00:05:47,249 --> 00:05:48,682
What are you thinking about?

106
00:05:49,569 --> 00:05:51,287
Thinking? Nothing.

107
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:53,644
What could I possibly be thinking?

108
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:56,477
You look like you've got something
on your mind.

109
00:05:56,649 --> 00:06:00,528
Yeah, right. I wish I had
something on my mind.

110
00:06:05,409 --> 00:06:06,762
So how about that Kramer?

111
00:06:07,329 --> 00:06:09,320
Yeah, how about him?

112
00:06:09,489 --> 00:06:13,118
- The way he just says stuff.
- He sure does.

113
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,086
Yeah, yeah.

114
00:06:15,929 --> 00:06:17,920
Yeah, he's quite a character.

115
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:21,005
So, what did you think?

116
00:06:21,369 --> 00:06:22,722
About the pizza?

117
00:06:23,369 --> 00:06:25,599
No. About the nose job.

118
00:06:26,249 --> 00:06:29,366
Oh, the nose job. Yeah...

119
00:06:29,649 --> 00:06:31,082
I don't know. I-

120
00:06:31,689 --> 00:06:35,398
- Well, what did you think?
- Well, I've thought about it...

121
00:06:35,649 --> 00:06:38,288
- ... but I don't know.
- Yeah.

122
00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:43,406
You know, not that I care
one way or the other...

123
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:47,244
...but these doctors today do amazing
things. If you were so inclined.

124
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:51,886
- And again, I'm not suggesting.
- I know. They're good.

125
00:06:52,049 --> 00:06:53,641
Peter Jennings had one.

126
00:06:53,809 --> 00:06:55,879
- Really?
- Probably. They all do.

127
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:58,961
In my high school,
half my graduating class had them.

128
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:01,404
Of course,
I'm from Long Island, so...

129
00:07:05,329 --> 00:07:07,559
It's really nothing.
It's like going to the dentist.

130
00:07:08,289 --> 00:07:11,486
- I hate the dentist.
- It's a cleaning.

131
00:07:13,249 --> 00:07:14,921
So you really think I should do this.

132
00:07:15,609 --> 00:07:19,568
If it makes you happy.
I don't focus on these things.

133
00:07:21,329 --> 00:07:23,047
I will tell you this, though.

134
00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:26,160
Unfortunately...

135
00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:28,923
...we live in a very
superficial society.

136
00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:31,807
I don't condone it...

137
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:34,117
...but it's a fact of life.

138
00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:37,280
Well, maybe I should.

139
00:07:37,809 --> 00:07:40,846
- What the hell?
- Now you talked her into a nose job?

140
00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:44,046
- Me? I didn't say anything.
- You encouraged her to get one.

141
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:46,928
- I didn't encourage. No encourage.
- "Peter Jennings had one"?

142
00:07:47,609 --> 00:07:48,837
It's possible.

143
00:07:49,129 --> 00:07:52,485
- You should accept her for who she is.
- No, George is right.

144
00:07:52,649 --> 00:07:54,924
- I wanna get one.
- I think it's a mistake.

145
00:07:55,089 --> 00:07:56,681
Me too. Really.

146
00:07:58,169 --> 00:08:00,046
Unless you'd really like one, then...

147
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,046
I'm going straight to hell.

148
00:08:06,209 --> 00:08:07,403
No two ways about it.

149
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:10,242
It might not be hell,
but you're gonna run into bad dudes.

150
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,764
Get the check.
She takes the bandages off at 4:00.

151
00:08:14,929 --> 00:08:16,521
We have time.

152
00:08:17,489 --> 00:08:19,525
It's exciting.
She's gonna have a new face.

153
00:08:20,049 --> 00:08:23,564
- It is exciting.
- Not as exciting as Miss Crop Circles.

154
00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:27,087
Please, please. Isabel?

155
00:08:27,249 --> 00:08:30,446
She is the most despicable woman
I have ever met in my life.

156
00:08:30,609 --> 00:08:34,284
I have never been so repulsed
by someone mentally...

157
00:08:34,449 --> 00:08:37,964
...and so attracted to them physically
at the same time.

158
00:08:38,129 --> 00:08:41,644
It's like my brain is facing my penis
in a chess game.

159
00:08:46,289 --> 00:08:47,881
And I'm letting him win.

160
00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:50,923
You're not letting him win.
He wins till you're 40.

161
00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:54,525
- Then what?
- He still wins, but it's not a blowout.

162
00:08:56,689 --> 00:08:58,122
She wants to be an actress.

163
00:08:58,289 --> 00:09:02,043
She makes me read these moronic
acting scenes with her, and I do it.

164
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:06,925
Because I'm so addicted to the sex,
I'm helpless. I'll do anything.

165
00:09:07,169 --> 00:09:09,319
So, finally, Kramer comes in
the other day.

166
00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:11,805
I don't want to see this woman
anymore...

167
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:14,437
...but I haven't got the willpower
to throw out her number.

168
00:09:14,609 --> 00:09:16,247
Please help me.

169
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,442
Help me.

170
00:09:23,169 --> 00:09:24,363
I'm proud of you.

171
00:09:26,929 --> 00:09:29,648
So I'm never gonna see her again.
I'm going cold turkey.

172
00:09:29,809 --> 00:09:31,128
Good for you.

173
00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:35,089
I'll tell you, the sex...

174
00:09:36,489 --> 00:09:38,923
I was like an animal.

175
00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:41,159
I mean, it was just
completely uninhibited.

176
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:46,446
It's like going to the bathroom in front
of a lot of people, and not caring.

177
00:09:50,929 --> 00:09:52,840
It's not like that at all.

178
00:09:57,209 --> 00:09:59,200
How do you even know
the jacket is there?

179
00:10:00,049 --> 00:10:01,323
Well, I don't. I'm guessing.

180
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:04,847
Okay, look, Audrey,
before you take the bandage off...

181
00:10:05,249 --> 00:10:08,082
...just remember, I was the one
that encouraged you to do this.

182
00:10:08,289 --> 00:10:11,964
Now that you're gonna be a great
beauty, let's not forget how this began.

183
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:14,404
- If you listened to your friend Elaine-
- George.

184
00:10:14,729 --> 00:10:16,082
- Yeah?
- Enough.

185
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:17,648
- Right, enough.
- Are we ready?

186
00:10:17,809 --> 00:10:19,606
Come on,
let's get this show on the road.

187
00:10:19,809 --> 00:10:22,198
- You sure you want us here for this?
- Yes.

188
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:25,805
- Shouldn't a doctor do it?
- No, he said I could do it.

189
00:10:25,969 --> 00:10:27,721
Okay, here goes.

190
00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:31,404
This is very exciting. Very exciting.
It's like watching a birth.

191
00:10:36,049 --> 00:10:37,801
It looks good.

192
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:41,237
- Great job.
- You got butchered.

193
00:10:48,289 --> 00:10:50,280
Head hurt.
No, I'm good. I'm fine.

194
00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:52,406
Let's put him over here.

195
00:10:53,489 --> 00:10:55,559
- Where are you going?
- To that doctor.

196
00:10:55,769 --> 00:10:57,600
Wait, wait, wait! I'll go with you.

197
00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:08,841
How you feeling?

198
00:11:09,809 --> 00:11:12,403
Too much salt in my diet.

199
00:11:13,209 --> 00:11:15,564
- Can I get you anything?
- I'm good.

200
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:18,279
You sure? Anything.

201
00:11:20,329 --> 00:11:21,762
No.

202
00:11:25,169 --> 00:11:27,603
Boy, it really didn't come out
too well, did it?

203
00:11:27,889 --> 00:11:31,199
No, it didn't. No, it didn't.

204
00:11:32,289 --> 00:11:33,688
It's, like, all dented.

205
00:11:35,249 --> 00:11:36,967
Seems to be.

206
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:41,520
Well, I'm sure
they'll be able to fix it.

207
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:46,445
You can't stop modern science.
Can't stop it. Can't stop science.

208
00:11:46,609 --> 00:11:49,487
Can't be stopped. No way, no how.
Science just marches-

209
00:11:49,649 --> 00:11:51,605
Shut up, George.

210
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:55,844
- Shut up?
- Yeah.

211
00:11:57,929 --> 00:11:59,487
Interesting.

212
00:12:02,369 --> 00:12:04,360
Come on, Kramer.
Seriously, give me her number!

213
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:06,042
- I threw it out.
- You're lying.

214
00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:08,359
- You've got it. I want the number.
- I threw it out.

215
00:12:08,569 --> 00:12:10,560
- Give it to me.
- You said not to.

216
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:13,323
- You made me promise.
- I changed my mind. I want it.

217
00:12:13,489 --> 00:12:15,366
You said no matter what,
I'm not to give it to you.

218
00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:17,599
- I was lying. Give it to me.
- You told me not to.

219
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:20,567
- I want the number!
- All right! You want it? Yeah!

220
00:12:20,969 --> 00:12:24,041
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah.
Yeah, look at you.

221
00:12:24,329 --> 00:12:26,240
Look at what you've sunk to.

222
00:12:26,409 --> 00:12:27,728
Look at what you've become.

223
00:12:28,009 --> 00:12:30,921
Look in the mirror, because you
need help, Jerry. You need help.

224
00:12:31,409 --> 00:12:35,084
Because I can't stand by and do it
anymore. It's turning my stomach.

225
00:12:35,249 --> 00:12:38,559
I can't stand around here
watching you destroy yourself!

226
00:12:38,729 --> 00:12:41,004
It's eating me up inside!

227
00:12:52,049 --> 00:12:56,998
The doctor said they need to build the
lateral wall of the septum. Over here.

228
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:58,437
Yeah.

229
00:12:58,609 --> 00:13:01,282
- You see this paranasal sinus cavity?
- Oh, I got it.

230
00:13:01,449 --> 00:13:05,806
See how it's collapsed?
That's what's causing this huge dent.

231
00:13:05,969 --> 00:13:08,244
Yeah. Rough, rough.

232
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:11,525
So anyway, you know what
I was thinking about?

233
00:13:12,049 --> 00:13:13,277
What?

234
00:13:13,449 --> 00:13:16,202
Remember we talked
about taking a trip together?

235
00:13:16,409 --> 00:13:20,482
- We did?
- We talked about going to Hawaii.

236
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:23,045
- Hawaii?
- Anyway, I think it would be great...

237
00:13:23,209 --> 00:13:25,677
...to get away after all this.

238
00:13:26,289 --> 00:13:27,722
Well, you-

239
00:13:29,849 --> 00:13:32,204
You know, Hawaii could be
a little tricky now.

240
00:13:32,369 --> 00:13:35,088
There's high-pressure winds
down there this time of year.

241
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:38,241
There's a lot of debris
constantly flying around, a lot of...

242
00:13:38,409 --> 00:13:40,445
...wood and lava.

243
00:13:40,809 --> 00:13:42,288
It could be dangerous.

244
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:45,925
- I never heard that.
- Oh, yeah. My friend lived there, so...

245
00:13:46,249 --> 00:13:48,683
We could go to the Caribbean.

246
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:52,607
I have to tell you something.
You couldn't get me on a plane now.

247
00:13:52,889 --> 00:13:54,766
I get those FAA reports directly.

248
00:13:54,969 --> 00:13:57,802
My uncle sends them to me.
He used to be a pilot, so...

249
00:13:58,329 --> 00:14:00,047
Big investigation in the...

250
00:14:00,689 --> 00:14:05,080
What's the word there?
Offing. It's in the offing.

251
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:10,767
But you shouldn't let that stop you
from going. You could go. I don't mind.

252
00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:13,526
- George?
- Yeah.

253
00:14:13,849 --> 00:14:15,919
I don't think this is working.

254
00:14:17,009 --> 00:14:21,924
Ever since you came back from
the Army, you've changed.

255
00:14:22,689 --> 00:14:27,240
I swear, Nelson, I don't even know
who you are anymore.

256
00:14:27,489 --> 00:14:29,480
I'm Nelson.

257
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:34,284
- That's not the line, Jerry.
- All right, all right, I'm sorry.

258
00:14:35,569 --> 00:14:39,562
Nothing's changed, Elma.
I just need more time.

259
00:14:41,129 --> 00:14:45,281
I swear, Nelson, sometimes at
night when you're not around...

260
00:14:46,049 --> 00:14:49,485
...I just go crazy thinking
about you.

261
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,368
Well, you just need to relax.

262
00:14:53,129 --> 00:14:54,767
Maybe a hobby. Bowling is fun.

263
00:14:55,849 --> 00:14:59,398
Yeah, bowling's good,
if you're really gross and ugly.

264
00:15:00,049 --> 00:15:02,438
Uh-oh. My organs
are playing chess again.

265
00:15:02,609 --> 00:15:06,443
I'm getting tired of this. What do you
say we play one for all the marbles?

266
00:15:06,609 --> 00:15:09,965
Oh, brain, what are you doing?
You cannot beat me.

267
00:15:10,129 --> 00:15:13,485
Do you have any idea who you're
dealing with? Forget about it.

268
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:15,082
I can't take her anymore.

269
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:18,764
- I hate reading her little acting scenes.
- Oh, so what?

270
00:15:18,929 --> 00:15:20,647
So you read from a little play.

271
00:15:20,809 --> 00:15:24,165
You can't put up with that for an hour
to make me happy? You're so selfish.

272
00:15:24,329 --> 00:15:25,921
Give me one hour.

273
00:15:26,369 --> 00:15:29,167
Then I will take over. You won't
have to think for the rest of the night.

274
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:30,682
What about tomorrow morning?

275
00:15:30,849 --> 00:15:34,285
Do you have any idea what
that's like for me? Do you care?

276
00:15:34,449 --> 00:15:35,882
No, you don't care.

277
00:15:36,049 --> 00:15:39,485
So long as you get to do
whatever it is you do.

278
00:15:39,649 --> 00:15:42,083
- You disgust me.
- Oh, go read a book.

279
00:15:42,249 --> 00:15:45,127
Enough chatter. Let's play.

280
00:15:45,969 --> 00:15:48,802
I'm only doing this because
you took Audrey to the hospital.

281
00:15:49,009 --> 00:15:52,206
Yeah. Yeah. Okay, now, you're clear?
You got everything?

282
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:53,882
- Yeah.
- Wait, wait, wait.

283
00:15:55,449 --> 00:15:56,677
Here.

284
00:15:57,129 --> 00:16:00,360
- What do I need this for?
- Because we're engaged.

285
00:16:01,009 --> 00:16:03,079
We're engaged?

286
00:16:03,449 --> 00:16:05,121
Kramer, this is too big.

287
00:16:05,609 --> 00:16:08,806
- It's my mom's.
- Hello!

288
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:13,247
Oh, hi. I'm Wanda Pepper.
I'm Albert Pepper's daughter.

289
00:16:13,409 --> 00:16:15,877
My father asked me to pick up
his jacket for him.

290
00:16:16,049 --> 00:16:18,279
Hello, Miss Pepper.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

291
00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:20,759
And you must be
Professor Von Nostrand.

292
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:22,123
Yes. Yes, I am.

293
00:16:22,889 --> 00:16:26,404
I've read your book, professor,
and I was quite intrigued by it.

294
00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:29,722
- Yes, well, it's very intriguing.
- Tell me...

295
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:33,006
...is it your contention that
Shakespeare was an impostor?

296
00:16:33,169 --> 00:16:34,602
- My contention?
- Your contention.

297
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:37,761
- Well, yes, that's my contention.
- I heard him contend that.

298
00:16:38,089 --> 00:16:39,920
It's too bad about your father.

299
00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:43,684
- It was a frame-up.
- A fine man. He spoke often of you.

300
00:16:43,849 --> 00:16:46,079
He's very proud of the work
you're doing.

301
00:16:46,449 --> 00:16:50,078
- We're all proud of the work I'm doing.
- Yes, she does fine work.

302
00:16:50,289 --> 00:16:54,601
Your father gave me strict orders
not to turn the jacket over to anyone...

303
00:16:54,769 --> 00:16:57,329
...but I suppose I can make
an exception in your case.

304
00:16:57,489 --> 00:16:59,559
- The closet's this way.
- How kind of you.

305
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:02,761
You know, your father has a very
extensive wardrobe.

306
00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:04,521
Yes.

307
00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:11,078
What's the matter, fella?
You look a little tired.

308
00:17:12,049 --> 00:17:13,960
Nelson, don't you see?

309
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,559
You are a part of me.

310
00:17:18,289 --> 00:17:19,961
And I...

311
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:23,083
I am a part of you.

312
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:25,162
She's killing me.

313
00:17:31,449 --> 00:17:32,848
That's your move?

314
00:17:33,009 --> 00:17:35,648
- Yeah.
- Well, that's trouble, my friend.

315
00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:37,561
That's big trouble.

316
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:39,202
Checkmate.

317
00:17:41,809 --> 00:17:44,369
Getting weak. Losing power.

318
00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:48,200
You haven't seen the last of me.
I'll be back.

319
00:17:48,689 --> 00:17:52,318
You're nothing without me.
Nothing.

320
00:17:54,329 --> 00:17:56,047
Little punk.

321
00:17:58,569 --> 00:18:01,720
Isabel, I don't think this is working.

322
00:18:05,609 --> 00:18:08,282
Daddy certainly does have
an extensive wardrobe.

323
00:18:08,449 --> 00:18:13,159
He is a fine dresser. I don't have to tell
you he's quite popular with the ladies.

324
00:18:13,409 --> 00:18:16,719
My father? Really? I had no idea.

325
00:18:16,889 --> 00:18:18,117
They're crazy about him.

326
00:18:18,289 --> 00:18:21,645
One in particular came around
about two years ago.

327
00:18:22,209 --> 00:18:24,928
Looked a lot like you, professor.
Could have been your mother.

328
00:18:25,329 --> 00:18:27,479
What was her name again?

329
00:18:27,969 --> 00:18:30,119
Carter? Kramer. That's it.

330
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:33,481
Babs Kramer. Nasty woman.

331
00:18:33,649 --> 00:18:35,799
Many a night I had to
throw her on the street...

332
00:18:35,969 --> 00:18:38,358
- ... drunken stumblebum.
- You don't say.

333
00:18:38,529 --> 00:18:41,760
- I found it!
- She walked around here half-naked...

334
00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:45,080
...sucking Colt 45 from a can.

335
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:49,162
Her big, fat stomach hanging out,
orthopaedic hose up to her knees...

336
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:51,047
...screaming down the hall:

337
00:18:51,209 --> 00:18:53,962
"Come back to bed, Albert,
you big hairy ape!

338
00:18:54,129 --> 00:18:57,724
And bring back that box of Danish!"

339
00:18:59,209 --> 00:19:01,803
- So I grabbed the guy by the collar.
- Yeah, and I yelled out:

340
00:19:01,969 --> 00:19:04,324
"Kramer, Kramer, you're killing him."

341
00:19:04,889 --> 00:19:07,403
- So I assume the jig was up.
- Yeah, pretty much.

342
00:19:07,569 --> 00:19:09,241
But look.

343
00:19:09,569 --> 00:19:11,002
Yes.

344
00:19:12,209 --> 00:19:15,007
- Hi. Here are your keys.
- Hi. Thank you.

345
00:19:15,169 --> 00:19:17,080
- Hello.
- Audrey.

346
00:19:18,249 --> 00:19:21,241
My God, you look incredible.
I can't believe it.

347
00:19:21,969 --> 00:19:24,961
Well, it was his doctor.
He was wonderful.

348
00:19:25,249 --> 00:19:27,001
So will I see you later tonight?

349
00:19:27,529 --> 00:19:29,485
Not sure.

350
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:33,883
Well, I'll check you guys out later.

351
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:36,440
- Ready?
- I didn't wash.

352
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:38,440
Neither did I.

353
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,324
We're off to the reggae lounge.

354
00:19:48,329 --> 00:19:51,958
My nose, my nose.
My kingdom for a nose.

355
00:19:52,569 --> 00:19:56,881
Isn't she beautiful? Her nose
is in such perfect proportions...

356
00:19:57,049 --> 00:19:59,563
...to the rest of her face.
She's breathtaking.

357
00:19:59,729 --> 00:20:02,118
- Who would have thought, she's-?
- Elaine...

358
00:20:02,649 --> 00:20:04,207
...shut up.

359
00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:08,562
The technical term
for a nose job is...?

360
00:20:08,769 --> 00:20:11,681
- Rhinoplasty.
- Rhinoplasty.

361
00:20:12,369 --> 00:20:15,486
Rhino. Okay?

362
00:20:16,529 --> 00:20:21,319
Do we really need to insult the person
at this moment of their lives?

363
00:20:21,489 --> 00:20:24,401
They know they have a big nose.
That's why they're coming in.

364
00:20:24,569 --> 00:20:27,925
Do they really need the abuse
of being compared to a rhinoceros...

365
00:20:28,129 --> 00:20:30,199
...on top of everything else?

366
00:20:30,569 --> 00:20:32,799
When someone has a
hair transplant, they don't go:

367
00:20:32,969 --> 00:20:36,200
"We're going to perform a
cue ball-ectomy on you, Mr. Johnson.

368
00:20:36,929 --> 00:20:40,478
We're going to attempt to remove
the skinheadia...

369
00:20:40,649 --> 00:20:43,880
...of your chromedomus,
which is what we-

370
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:46,483
The technical term..."

371
00:21:31,369 --> 00:21:33,360
