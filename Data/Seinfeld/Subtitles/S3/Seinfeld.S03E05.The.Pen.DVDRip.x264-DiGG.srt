1
00:00:04,369 --> 00:00:06,929
I have never seen an old person
in a new bathing suit...

2
00:00:07,089 --> 00:00:10,047
...in my life. I don't know where
they get their bathing suits.

3
00:00:10,609 --> 00:00:13,328
But my father has bathing suits
from other centuries.

4
00:00:13,489 --> 00:00:14,842
My parents live in Florida.

5
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:17,807
And if you go down there and
you forget your bathing suit...

6
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:20,358
...then they want you
to wear one of theirs.

7
00:00:20,689 --> 00:00:22,008
You know how that gets?

8
00:00:22,169 --> 00:00:24,967
"You need trunks, son?
I got trunks for you.

9
00:00:25,129 --> 00:00:26,926
You can wear my trunks."

10
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:29,683
Fathers don't wear bathing
suits, they wear trunks.

11
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:33,239
It's kind of the same thing a tree
would wear if it went swimming.

12
00:00:33,769 --> 00:00:37,125
So I get in the water in this thing,
and it's, like, floating around me...

13
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:39,041
...somewhere.

14
00:00:39,209 --> 00:00:41,484
You ever put on a bathing suit
that you don't know...

15
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:43,719
...exactly where you are
inside the bathing suit?

16
00:00:43,889 --> 00:00:46,039
You bump into somebody,
"No, I'm parasailing.

17
00:00:46,209 --> 00:00:48,120
I'm waiting for the boat
to come back."

18
00:00:54,209 --> 00:00:56,439
It was supposed to be here at 7:30.

19
00:00:56,609 --> 00:00:59,248
- Call the airlines again.
- What happened to the Scotch tape?

20
00:00:59,409 --> 00:01:00,888
Who takes the Scotch tape?

21
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:03,483
Nobody returns anything
around here.

22
00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:05,162
Oh, I think that's them.

23
00:01:05,329 --> 00:01:06,887
Know what I'll do next time?

24
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:08,528
I'll hide it so nobody can find it.

25
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:12,522
- Hi! Welcome!
- Hi!

26
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:14,168
- Welcome.
- How are you?

27
00:01:14,329 --> 00:01:17,526
- Welcome to Florida!
- Hi, Mr. Seinfeld.

28
00:01:17,689 --> 00:01:19,964
Hey, there's the old man.

29
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:22,484
So, what took you so long?

30
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:25,083
We waited 35 minutes
in the rent-a-car place.

31
00:01:25,249 --> 00:01:27,399
I don't know why.
We would have picked you up.

32
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:29,719
- What's the difference?
- You could use our car.

33
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:31,322
I don't want to use your car.

34
00:01:31,489 --> 00:01:33,525
- What's wrong with our car?
- Nothing. It's fine.

35
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:35,407
- What if you want to use it?
- We don't.

36
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:38,288
- What? We use it.
- If you were using it, we wouldn't.

37
00:01:38,449 --> 00:01:39,677
So, what, you'd hitch?

38
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,283
- How much is a rent-a-car?
- I don't know, 25 bucks a day.

39
00:01:42,449 --> 00:01:45,327
- What? Oh, you're crazy.
- Plus the insurance.

40
00:01:45,489 --> 00:01:46,922
Oh, I didn't get the insurance.

41
00:01:47,089 --> 00:01:49,239
How could you not
get the insurance?

42
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:50,883
We'll pay for the car.

43
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:53,085
- You're not paying for it.
- Morty.

44
00:01:54,249 --> 00:01:56,126
God, it's so hot in here.

45
00:01:57,849 --> 00:01:59,601
Why don't you put on
the air conditioning?

46
00:01:59,769 --> 00:02:03,398
You don't need the air conditioner.
Do you have your speech all ready?

47
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:05,161
Do I have to make a speech?

48
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:07,968
Of course. They're giving
a testimonial for your father.

49
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:10,199
- You could do your comic routines.
- Oh, yeah.

50
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:13,008
That'll go over real well
with that crowd.

51
00:02:13,249 --> 00:02:14,841
You have a lake.

52
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:16,921
- The lake isn't real.
- The lake is real.

53
00:02:17,089 --> 00:02:18,681
Are you kidding? They built the lake.

54
00:02:18,849 --> 00:02:21,363
But it's real, it's water.

55
00:02:22,249 --> 00:02:25,161
- Where are you going with those?
- I'll put Elaine's stuff in here.

56
00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:27,160
Don't sleep in there.
Sleep in the bedroom.

57
00:02:27,609 --> 00:02:28,928
I can't take your bedroom.

58
00:02:29,089 --> 00:02:32,206
- I'm up at 6:00 in the morning.
- I can't kick you out of your bed.

59
00:02:32,369 --> 00:02:34,360
We don't even sleep.

60
00:02:34,809 --> 00:02:36,925
- Ma.
- It's a sofa bed.

61
00:02:37,089 --> 00:02:39,000
- You'll be uncomfortable.
- What about you?

62
00:02:39,169 --> 00:02:40,363
Why should I be comfortable?

63
00:02:41,609 --> 00:02:43,679
- What about him?
- Don't worry. He's comfortable.

64
00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:45,805
I'll sleep standing up. I'll be fine.

65
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:50,285
- Will you stop?
- Yeah, I'll just stay in here.

66
00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:52,767
Jerry.

67
00:02:55,529 --> 00:02:58,282
Jerry, you don't have to stay
on the couch on my account.

68
00:02:58,449 --> 00:03:01,327
- You two can stay in there together.
- That's not a good idea.

69
00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:04,208
- I thought that you-
- Not now. She's right inside.

70
00:03:04,369 --> 00:03:05,722
What happened?

71
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:08,767
I don't know. We decided we
don't really work as a couple.

72
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:11,165
- What does that mean?
- Well-

73
00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:13,160
Why are you whispering?

74
00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:15,645
- Nothing, nothing.
- Elaine.

75
00:03:15,809 --> 00:03:17,765
- What about her?
- Would you please be-?

76
00:03:19,369 --> 00:03:22,122
You know, look at the
sun-dried tomatoes.

77
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:24,484
Where were they five years ago?

78
00:03:24,649 --> 00:03:27,004
It just goes to show you,
you never know what-

79
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:29,399
What, you know, could happen...

80
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:33,159
...to a vegetable. It could just
take right off at any time.

81
00:03:36,529 --> 00:03:38,281
We've tried all kinds
of arrangements...

82
00:03:38,449 --> 00:03:41,088
...but we can't seem to be friends
when we sleep together.

83
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:43,763
Why do you need more friends?

84
00:03:43,929 --> 00:03:45,408
You've got plenty of friends.

85
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:48,687
- He's an idealist.
- What are you looking for?

86
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:51,363
- I'm looking. I like looking.
- He likes looking.

87
00:03:51,529 --> 00:03:53,042
- So look.
- But how long can you look?

88
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:55,200
I'm going for the record.

89
00:03:57,329 --> 00:03:59,968
Your father wouldn't say so,
but he's really glad you came.

90
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:02,040
- Oh, come on.
- This is a big thing for him.

91
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:04,598
Outgoing president
of the condo association.

92
00:04:08,369 --> 00:04:10,758
So they arrived safely.

93
00:04:10,929 --> 00:04:13,284
- Remember Jack and Doris?
- Nice to see you.

94
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:15,041
- This is Elaine.
- Hi.

95
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:16,608
- Nice to meet you. Hello.
- Hello.

96
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:18,521
- Pleased to meet you.
- Hey, Jerry...

97
00:04:18,689 --> 00:04:21,249
...you came all the way
down here for this?

98
00:04:21,409 --> 00:04:22,683
And scuba diving.

99
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,760
Scuba diving?
Who's going scuba diving?

100
00:04:24,929 --> 00:04:26,760
We're going. We'll be back in time.

101
00:04:26,929 --> 00:04:28,647
What do you have to go
scuba diving for?

102
00:04:28,809 --> 00:04:30,606
- For fun.
- For fun?

103
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:32,441
Jack, have some sponge cake.

104
00:04:33,369 --> 00:04:35,246
No. Thanks, no.

105
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:36,603
Jack is emceeing tomorrow.

106
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:40,081
- He's in charge of the whole thing.
- So, Jerry, your mother tells me...

107
00:04:40,249 --> 00:04:42,888
...you're gonna do one of your
little comedy skits tomorrow.

108
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:45,483
- I don't think so.
- No?

109
00:04:45,649 --> 00:04:48,038
Listen, Morty, you want to
settle up for last night?

110
00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:53,158
All right. I owe you $19.45.

111
00:04:53,329 --> 00:04:55,399
What did you have?
You had the minute steak.

112
00:04:55,569 --> 00:04:57,161
- Yeah.
- Did you have a Coke or what?

113
00:04:57,329 --> 00:04:59,718
I did not have a Coke.

114
00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:01,083
Somebody had a Coke.

115
00:05:01,329 --> 00:05:03,160
- I had a Coke.
- Oh, and I had the scampi.

116
00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:07,199
So, that's $17.10,
and the tax and the tip.

117
00:05:07,569 --> 00:05:09,560
All right, make it 20 bucks.

118
00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:13,005
It's $19.45, Morty.

119
00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:14,727
$19.45?

120
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:16,522
See, you know your father.

121
00:05:16,689 --> 00:05:18,725
You got to get it right
to the penny.

122
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:21,323
But that's why he was
such a good president.

123
00:05:21,769 --> 00:05:23,043
Hey, what kind of pen is that?

124
00:05:24,529 --> 00:05:25,803
- This pen?
- Yeah.

125
00:05:25,969 --> 00:05:28,437
Oh, this is an astronaut pen.

126
00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:31,647
It writes upside down.
They use this in space.

127
00:05:31,809 --> 00:05:35,643
Oh, that's the astronaut pen. I heard
about that. Where did you get it?

128
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:39,087
- It was a gift.
- Because a lot of times I write in bed...

129
00:05:39,249 --> 00:05:42,241
...and I have to turn and lean on
my elbow to make the pen work.

130
00:05:44,329 --> 00:05:45,728
- Take the pen.
- Oh, no.

131
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:46,924
- Go ahead.
- I couldn't.

132
00:05:47,089 --> 00:05:48,238
- Take it.
- I can't take it.

133
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:50,525
- Do me a personal favour.
- No, I'm not comfortable.

134
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:52,486
- I cannot take it.
- Take the pen.

135
00:05:52,649 --> 00:05:55,686
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive. Take the pen.

136
00:05:56,209 --> 00:05:59,997
Okay, thank you very much.
Thank you. Gee, boy.

137
00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:02,239
- Jack, what are you doing?
- Stop it.

138
00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:04,047
Jack, we should go.

139
00:06:06,049 --> 00:06:08,165
It was nice meeting you.

140
00:06:08,329 --> 00:06:09,728
- Nice to meet you.
- Thanks again.

141
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:11,408
Come on!

142
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:13,446
She's adorable.

143
00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:18,888
What did you take his pen for?

144
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:22,924
- He gave it to me.
- But you didn't have to take it.

145
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:25,205
She's gotta make a big deal
out of everything.

146
00:06:25,369 --> 00:06:28,122
- He offered it to me.
- Because you made such a big fuss.

147
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:30,678
Well, I liked it. Should I
have said I didn't like it?

148
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:33,443
You shouldn't have said anything.
What did you expect?

149
00:06:33,609 --> 00:06:36,362
He could have said, "Thank you,"
and put it back in his pocket.

150
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:39,202
- He loves that pen.
- Come on.

151
00:06:39,369 --> 00:06:42,122
He talks about it all the time.
He goes on and on...

152
00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:44,803
...about how it writes upside down,
how astronauts use it.

153
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:46,607
He never should have offered it.

154
00:06:46,769 --> 00:06:49,567
- He didn't think you'd accept.
- Well, he was wrong.

155
00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:53,328
I know his wife.
She has some mouth on her.

156
00:06:53,489 --> 00:06:56,765
She'll tell everyone in the condo now
that you made him give you the pen.

157
00:06:57,169 --> 00:06:59,000
They're talking about it right now.

158
00:06:59,249 --> 00:07:01,558
- So you want me to return it?
- Yes.

159
00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:03,959
He's not gonna return that pen.
That's ridiculous.

160
00:07:04,129 --> 00:07:05,721
I don't even want the pen now.

161
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:08,687
Jack can afford to give away a pen
with all his money, believe me.

162
00:07:08,849 --> 00:07:11,363
He gives me a check for $19.45.

163
00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:14,089
He didn't have a Coke.

164
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,646
Here, let me see it.

165
00:07:19,809 --> 00:07:22,881
- Hey, it writes upside down.
- Yeah.

166
00:07:33,249 --> 00:07:35,126
Come in.

167
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:38,288
You okay in here?

168
00:07:39,529 --> 00:07:42,362
Why is it so hot in here?

169
00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:45,241
How can they sleep like this?

170
00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:46,967
It's only for three days.

171
00:07:47,129 --> 00:07:48,801
Today's over.
Then we have tomorrow.

172
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,881
We leave on Sunday.
It's one day, really.

173
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:57,163
What is with this bar?

174
00:07:57,849 --> 00:08:00,124
It's right in my back. It's killing me.

175
00:08:00,289 --> 00:08:02,200
You wanna switch?
I'm on a love seat.

176
00:08:02,369 --> 00:08:05,679
I got my feet up in the air
like I'm in a space capsule.

177
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:08,007
I am never gonna fall asleep.

178
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:10,558
Oh, no, don't say that.
You'll jinx me.

179
00:08:12,209 --> 00:08:14,439
How can they not put
the air conditioning on?

180
00:08:14,609 --> 00:08:16,759
They're nuts with temperature.

181
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:21,967
This bar is right in my back.

182
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:26,325
It's making a dent.

183
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:33,000
How about that guy
writing a check for $19.45?

184
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:35,242
I'm sweating here.

185
00:08:36,129 --> 00:08:39,087
I'm in bed, sweating.

186
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:41,001
It's one day.

187
00:08:41,329 --> 00:08:43,081
Half a day, really.

188
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:47,561
I mean, you subtract showers
and meals, it's like 20 minutes.

189
00:08:47,849 --> 00:08:49,805
It'll go by like that.

190
00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:54,286
Stay on 95 South
to Biscayne Boulevard.

191
00:08:55,689 --> 00:08:56,838
Then you make a left turn.

192
00:08:57,409 --> 00:09:00,481
Put your blinker on immediately,
there's an abutment there.

193
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:03,721
Then you're gonna merge over
very quickly, but stay on Biscayne.

194
00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:05,641
Don't get off Biscayne,
you understand me?

195
00:09:05,809 --> 00:09:07,686
Stay on Biscayne.

196
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:09,962
You're going underwater?

197
00:09:10,129 --> 00:09:12,962
Yes, generally, that's where
scuba diving is done.

198
00:09:13,249 --> 00:09:16,047
What do you have to go for?
What's down there that's so special?

199
00:09:17,169 --> 00:09:18,887
What's so special up here?

200
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:22,723
What's the matter?

201
00:09:22,889 --> 00:09:25,278
- My back.
- What happened?

202
00:09:25,449 --> 00:09:26,848
That- That bed.

203
00:09:27,009 --> 00:09:29,318
The bar was right in my back.

204
00:09:29,489 --> 00:09:31,445
I told you to let us sleep in there.

205
00:09:31,609 --> 00:09:33,281
Then you would be hunched over.

206
00:09:34,289 --> 00:09:36,757
I don't even know if
I can go scuba diving.

207
00:09:36,929 --> 00:09:39,159
- You can't go?
- So stay home.

208
00:09:39,689 --> 00:09:41,441
- You can go.
- Without you?

209
00:09:41,609 --> 00:09:43,008
That's the reason you came down.

210
00:09:43,169 --> 00:09:44,966
- Don't go.
- You sure?

211
00:09:45,129 --> 00:09:46,403
Maybe you should see a doctor.

212
00:09:46,649 --> 00:09:49,163
- We'll stay in a hotel tonight.
- No, we'll stay in there.

213
00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:50,603
Why don't you get a new sofa?

214
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:52,920
Nobody uses it.

215
00:09:53,289 --> 00:09:54,927
I'm buying you a new sofa.

216
00:09:55,089 --> 00:09:56,408
Jerry, don't talk crazy.

217
00:09:56,569 --> 00:09:58,446
Mrs. Seinfeld, please...

218
00:09:58,689 --> 00:10:00,645
...I am begging you:

219
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:04,722
Put the air conditioner on.

220
00:10:08,049 --> 00:10:09,641
You're hot?

221
00:10:10,929 --> 00:10:13,489
I've lost six pounds.

222
00:10:13,929 --> 00:10:15,521
I don't even know how to work it.

223
00:10:15,689 --> 00:10:18,078
I keep telling her
it's like an oven in here.

224
00:10:19,729 --> 00:10:21,003
Is everybody up?

225
00:10:21,169 --> 00:10:22,841
Hi, how are you?

226
00:10:23,009 --> 00:10:24,442
Hello, Jerry.

227
00:10:24,609 --> 00:10:26,088
Evelyn, this is Elaine.

228
00:10:26,329 --> 00:10:27,523
Hi, Evelyn.

229
00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:31,125
Jerry, you got thin.

230
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:32,842
- Too thin?
- Oh, stop worrying...

231
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:34,442
...so much about how you look.

232
00:10:36,489 --> 00:10:38,241
So where's the new pen?

233
00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:49,406
- What?
- The pen.

234
00:10:49,569 --> 00:10:51,525
The one Jack Klompus gave you.

235
00:10:51,889 --> 00:10:54,244
- How did you know that?
- Blanche told me.

236
00:10:54,409 --> 00:10:57,924
- Blanche?
- That's some good pen.

237
00:10:58,089 --> 00:11:01,206
- Writes upside down.
- Yeah.

238
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:05,001
- The astronauts use them.
- What did Blanche say?

239
00:11:05,169 --> 00:11:07,524
I don't know, she said
Jerry wanted the pen.

240
00:11:07,689 --> 00:11:09,759
I never really wanted the pen.

241
00:11:09,929 --> 00:11:11,726
- He gave him the pen.
- Morty.

242
00:11:11,889 --> 00:11:14,449
- Why? You don't like the pen?
- No, no, I-

243
00:11:14,609 --> 00:11:16,520
Because if you don't,
give it back to him.

244
00:11:16,689 --> 00:11:18,566
- Is that what she said?
- Who?

245
00:11:18,729 --> 00:11:20,845
- Blanche.
- What are you talking about?

246
00:11:23,929 --> 00:11:25,123
Hello?

247
00:11:25,289 --> 00:11:28,042
Oh, hello, Gussy. What?

248
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:31,406
Jerry wouldn't do that.
Jack gave it to him.

249
00:11:32,849 --> 00:11:35,568
All he said was he liked it.

250
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:37,685
I mean, nobody put
a gun to his head.

251
00:11:37,849 --> 00:11:40,363
You're giving him back that pen.

252
00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:43,762
Somebody, please.

253
00:11:43,929 --> 00:11:45,567
The air conditioner.

254
00:11:45,889 --> 00:11:47,527
Oh, my God, I forgot all about it.

255
00:11:47,689 --> 00:11:51,318
All I said was, "I like the pen."

256
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:54,438
How the hell do you
work this thing?

257
00:11:57,929 --> 00:12:00,204
Maybe you shouldn't go tonight.

258
00:12:00,369 --> 00:12:02,325
Oh, no, no, I wanna go.

259
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:03,888
But your back hurts.

260
00:12:04,049 --> 00:12:06,244
Maybe a couple of muscle
relaxers would help.

261
00:12:06,609 --> 00:12:08,167
Oh, okay.

262
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,679
You can turn down the air
conditioning if you want.

263
00:12:12,849 --> 00:12:14,567
No, I'm fine.

264
00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:17,648
- You're not too cold?
- No.

265
00:12:19,129 --> 00:12:21,802
- Don't be alarmed.
- Oh, my God.

266
00:12:21,969 --> 00:12:23,846
- What the hell happened to you?
- I'm okay.

267
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:26,569
- My capillaries burst.
- Your capillaries?

268
00:12:26,729 --> 00:12:29,243
- Do you know what you look like?
- How you doing?

269
00:12:29,409 --> 00:12:31,081
Having a good time.

270
00:12:31,249 --> 00:12:33,638
Is it my imagination
or is it freezing in here?

271
00:12:33,809 --> 00:12:35,242
What happened to your eyes?

272
00:12:35,409 --> 00:12:37,969
- Well, I started to go under-
- With the instructor?

273
00:12:38,129 --> 00:12:39,562
Yeah, I got about 10 feet down...

274
00:12:39,729 --> 00:12:42,402
...and felt this tremendous
pressure on my mask...

275
00:12:42,569 --> 00:12:45,402
...like my eyeballs were being
sucked out of their sockets.

276
00:12:45,569 --> 00:12:46,797
I told you.

277
00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:48,522
Excuse me.

278
00:12:48,689 --> 00:12:51,487
Doris would like to borrow
your red pocketbook...

279
00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:53,207
...to go with her shoes.

280
00:12:53,369 --> 00:12:55,166
The shoes have to match
the pocketbook.

281
00:12:56,089 --> 00:12:57,966
What's she doing, yoga?

282
00:12:58,649 --> 00:13:00,526
- My back hurts.
- Morty, better hurry up.

283
00:13:00,689 --> 00:13:02,600
- Get ready.
- We got plenty of time.

284
00:13:02,769 --> 00:13:04,839
- What happened?
- I got in a fistfight...

285
00:13:05,009 --> 00:13:07,284
...with one of the ladies at the pool.

286
00:13:07,769 --> 00:13:09,168
It's from scuba diving.

287
00:13:09,449 --> 00:13:10,928
What's there to see underwater?

288
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:13,126
Listen, Mr. Klompus...

289
00:13:13,289 --> 00:13:17,168
...it was a nice gesture to give me
the pen, but I don't really need it.

290
00:13:18,329 --> 00:13:20,047
- You what?
- It's a terrific pen...

291
00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:21,767
...but I think you should keep it.

292
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:24,041
- Well, I mean-
- Take it.

293
00:13:24,689 --> 00:13:26,247
All right.

294
00:13:26,409 --> 00:13:29,765
You know, Jack, you got a hell
of a nerve taking that kid's pen.

295
00:13:29,969 --> 00:13:31,402
- Whose pen?
- His pen.

296
00:13:31,569 --> 00:13:32,763
This happens to be my pen.

297
00:13:32,929 --> 00:13:35,523
- You didn't give it to him?
- What are you talking about?

298
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:37,247
He practically begged me for it.

299
00:13:37,929 --> 00:13:39,442
Where do you come off
with this crap?

300
00:13:39,609 --> 00:13:42,521
Listen, do you think I take
everything everybody offers me?

301
00:13:42,849 --> 00:13:44,601
You offered me
sponge cake yesterday.

302
00:13:44,769 --> 00:13:46,566
- Did I take it?
- You didn't want it.

303
00:13:46,729 --> 00:13:49,801
Of course I wanted it!
I love sponge cake.

304
00:13:49,969 --> 00:13:51,607
Who said you couldn't have it?
I mean...

305
00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:54,124
...what the hell do I care whether
you have sponge cake?

306
00:13:54,289 --> 00:13:56,359
Because I saw the look
on your face last week...

307
00:13:56,529 --> 00:13:58,247
...when I took the Scotch tape.

308
00:13:58,689 --> 00:14:00,361
So you got the Scotch tape.

309
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:02,838
- I've been looking all over for it.
- I'll give it back.

310
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,920
- I don't want it.
- I don't want it!

311
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:07,999
You know, Jack,
do me a favour, will you?

312
00:14:08,169 --> 00:14:11,366
Take the pen and the Scotch tape
and get the hell out of here.

313
00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:13,167
Listen, do you think I give a damn?

314
00:14:17,169 --> 00:14:19,842
Nerve of that guy,
taking back that pen.

315
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:21,488
Well, that's it for them.

316
00:14:21,649 --> 00:14:25,085
What is going on
in this community?

317
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:27,241
Are you people aware
of what's happening?

318
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:29,764
What is driving you
to this behaviour?

319
00:14:29,929 --> 00:14:32,045
Is it the humidity? Is it the Muzak?

320
00:14:32,209 --> 00:14:34,040
Is it the white shoes?

321
00:14:34,609 --> 00:14:38,045
I have no use for either one of them.
I don't want them there tonight.

322
00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:39,528
Isn't he supposed to emcee?

323
00:14:39,889 --> 00:14:41,607
Yeah, he's supposed
to be the emcee.

324
00:14:42,289 --> 00:14:44,325
Well, this should be
a very interesting evening.

325
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:49,165
What about those muscle relaxers?

326
00:14:52,969 --> 00:14:55,085
Say "astronaut."

327
00:14:55,849 --> 00:14:57,646
Say what?

328
00:14:58,169 --> 00:15:00,205
Say what?

329
00:15:00,369 --> 00:15:02,644
You took too many of those pills.

330
00:15:03,089 --> 00:15:04,841
- Astronaut?
- Say it.

331
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:08,206
- Astronaut!
- Astro...

332
00:15:11,849 --> 00:15:12,998
Good. Okay.

333
00:15:13,169 --> 00:15:15,399
Last year, I took him
to the hospital every day.

334
00:15:15,569 --> 00:15:17,480
Did he ever say thank you?

335
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:19,162
Oh, God.

336
00:15:19,329 --> 00:15:21,001
Uncle Leo.

337
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:23,317
Hello!

338
00:15:24,969 --> 00:15:27,881
- Morty, are you nervous?
- What nervous?

339
00:15:28,049 --> 00:15:30,563
What's with the sunglasses?
Who are you, Van Johnson?

340
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:31,878
I got a black eye.

341
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:34,367
Hello.

342
00:15:34,929 --> 00:15:36,999
Oh, Elaine...

343
00:15:37,649 --> 00:15:39,082
...this is my Aunt Stella.

344
00:15:40,049 --> 00:15:42,085
Stella!

345
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:46,760
Stella!

346
00:15:47,849 --> 00:15:49,919
Her back hurts.

347
00:15:52,449 --> 00:15:54,565
We saw you on
The Tonight Show last week.

348
00:15:54,729 --> 00:15:57,289
I thought Johnny
was very rude to you.

349
00:15:57,449 --> 00:16:00,441
- He didn't even let you talk.
- No, no.

350
00:16:00,609 --> 00:16:01,928
You need some new material.

351
00:16:02,089 --> 00:16:05,399
I've heard you do that
dog routine three times already.

352
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:08,609
Stella!

353
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:10,766
Stella!

354
00:16:12,169 --> 00:16:15,718
You should get your cousin Jeffrey
to write some material for you.

355
00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:18,449
What? Jeffrey works for
the Parks Department.

356
00:16:18,609 --> 00:16:20,918
You should read
the letters he's written.

357
00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:23,398
He's funnier than
the whole bunch of you.

358
00:16:23,689 --> 00:16:26,283
Oh, here's Jack.
We should sit down.

359
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:32,399
This better be good.
I'm missing Golden Girls for this.

360
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:36,723
I hate her like poison.

361
00:16:39,569 --> 00:16:41,685
Hey, Jack, let's get started.

362
00:16:47,369 --> 00:16:49,963
Ladies and gentlemen,
as you know...

363
00:16:50,329 --> 00:16:55,084
...every year, phase two
of the Pines of Mar Gables...

364
00:16:55,249 --> 00:16:57,968
...honours the previous
year's president.

365
00:16:58,129 --> 00:16:59,926
And this year, we are honouring...

366
00:17:00,089 --> 00:17:01,488
...Morty Seinfeld.

367
00:17:01,649 --> 00:17:03,367
Morty!

368
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:09,640
A man who slept more hours
on the job than Ronald Reagan.

369
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:14,200
Slept on the job?

370
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:17,122
Being president of the condo
is not easy.

371
00:17:17,289 --> 00:17:20,406
It requires hard work, dedication,
and commitment.

372
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:25,438
And unfortunately, he possesses
none of these qualities.

373
00:17:28,049 --> 00:17:29,801
I wonder what he ever did.

374
00:17:29,969 --> 00:17:31,880
He's joking.

375
00:17:32,049 --> 00:17:35,200
His administration did
excel in one department:

376
00:17:35,369 --> 00:17:37,803
The hiring of incompetents.

377
00:17:38,129 --> 00:17:39,926
That's what you say.

378
00:17:40,089 --> 00:17:43,047
But we do owe him
a debt of gratitude...

379
00:17:43,209 --> 00:17:46,758
...because by not fixing
the crack in the sidewalk...

380
00:17:46,929 --> 00:17:51,286
...it put Mrs. Ziven out of
commission for a few weeks.

381
00:17:52,409 --> 00:17:54,525
Tell them about when you
took my son's pen back.

382
00:17:54,689 --> 00:17:56,327
Tell them about that.

383
00:17:56,529 --> 00:17:57,803
Dad.

384
00:17:57,969 --> 00:18:00,483
He gave my son a pen,
and then he takes it back.

385
00:18:00,649 --> 00:18:02,207
- Tell them that!
- I took it back?

386
00:18:02,369 --> 00:18:04,519
- He gave it to me!
- That's enough. Sit down.

387
00:18:04,689 --> 00:18:07,203
- I'm not finished!
- Give me that microphone. Give it!

388
00:18:07,369 --> 00:18:09,758
- Morty, give me that.
- Give him the pen.

389
00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:13,484
You broke my dental plate.

390
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:15,880
Doris! He broke my dental plate.

391
00:18:16,049 --> 00:18:18,199
You son of a bitch. I'll sue you.

392
00:18:18,369 --> 00:18:19,722
Jerry, do your act.

393
00:18:19,929 --> 00:18:21,726
I can't. Nobody's even listening.

394
00:18:21,889 --> 00:18:23,402
Well, they're all gonna leave.

395
00:18:23,849 --> 00:18:26,283
- I got witnesses here.
- Even your wife is on my side.

396
00:18:26,449 --> 00:18:28,485
How you folks doing tonight?

397
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:32,005
Hey, have you ever noticed how they
give you the peanuts on the planes?

398
00:18:32,169 --> 00:18:34,888
- Not my Harry! He flies first class!
- Who thought the thing...

399
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:37,244
...everybody wants on a plane
is a peanut?

400
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:40,526
- I'd rather have a bottle of Scotch!
- Do the dog routine.

401
00:18:41,369 --> 00:18:44,441
All I said was, "I like the pen!"

402
00:18:46,409 --> 00:18:50,118
Stella!

403
00:18:51,209 --> 00:18:52,528
You could aggravate it.

404
00:18:53,209 --> 00:18:55,165
I wouldn't go anywhere
for at least five days.

405
00:18:55,649 --> 00:18:57,367
Five days?

406
00:18:57,529 --> 00:18:59,884
You want me to stay here
for five more days?

407
00:19:00,049 --> 00:19:01,801
There must be some mistake.

408
00:19:02,209 --> 00:19:03,722
I'm afraid not.

409
00:19:03,889 --> 00:19:05,959
Five days. Here.

410
00:19:06,249 --> 00:19:09,286
So we have you for five more days.

411
00:19:09,969 --> 00:19:12,358
There's no point in me staying.
You're just gonna be-

412
00:19:12,529 --> 00:19:14,042
Excuse me?

413
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:16,008
Nothing.

414
00:19:17,649 --> 00:19:20,004
- Good morning.
- Hi, Evelyn.

415
00:19:20,249 --> 00:19:23,207
Has Morty decided on a lawyer yet?

416
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:25,679
- I don't think so.
- Because my nephew Larry...

417
00:19:25,849 --> 00:19:27,885
...could do it. He's a brilliant lawyer.

418
00:19:28,049 --> 00:19:30,085
He says Jack has no case.

419
00:19:30,329 --> 00:19:32,206
I'll ask him when he gets up.

420
00:19:32,369 --> 00:19:34,246
Oh, and I spoke to Arnold...

421
00:19:34,569 --> 00:19:38,960
...and he says that according to the
bylaws of the condo constitution...

422
00:19:39,129 --> 00:19:43,361
...they need six votes to throw you out
for unruly behaviour.

423
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:45,323
Not five.

424
00:19:45,609 --> 00:19:48,282
Dr. Chernov is the one
you'll have to suck up to.

425
00:19:52,489 --> 00:19:53,842
Oh, my back.

426
00:19:54,009 --> 00:19:55,806
Oh, my back.

427
00:19:55,969 --> 00:19:59,086
That bar. Who the hell
could sleep on that thing?

428
00:19:59,409 --> 00:20:01,923
- I was very comfortable.
- Morty...

429
00:20:02,089 --> 00:20:05,161
...Arnold says they need
six votes to throw you out.

430
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,728
It's in the constitution.

431
00:20:06,889 --> 00:20:09,767
- Who are you?
- I'm a chiropractor.

432
00:20:09,929 --> 00:20:12,159
What, are you kidding me?

433
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:14,608
Five more days?

434
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:19,799
Well, today's almost over,
and weekdays always go by fast.

435
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:22,437
And Friday, we're leaving,
so it's like two days, really.

436
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,925
It's like a cup of coffee.

437
00:20:26,289 --> 00:20:28,200
It'll go by like that.

438
00:20:28,809 --> 00:20:32,119
Is Florida not hot and muggy
enough for these people?

439
00:20:32,289 --> 00:20:33,768
They love heat.

440
00:20:33,929 --> 00:20:36,284
If they ever decide to
land men on the sun...

441
00:20:36,449 --> 00:20:39,202
...I think these old retired guys
will be the only ones...

442
00:20:39,369 --> 00:20:41,678
...that will be able to handle it.
They'll sit there...

443
00:20:41,849 --> 00:20:45,159
...on the redwood benches,
washcloth on their head, going:

444
00:20:45,609 --> 00:20:47,964
"I'm trying to get a sweat going."

445
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:33,280
