1
00:00:02,049 --> 00:00:04,802
Does it seem to you
that the ventriloquist dummy...

2
00:00:06,369 --> 00:00:09,725
...has a very active sexual,
social life?

3
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:13,479
He's always talking about dates
and women that he knows...

4
00:00:13,649 --> 00:00:15,844
...and bringing them back
to the suitcase at night.

5
00:00:16,009 --> 00:00:19,365
There's always a sawdust joke
in there somewhere, you know.

6
00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:22,077
He says kinky things,
because he's made out of wood...

7
00:00:22,249 --> 00:00:23,762
...and he can spin his head around.

8
00:00:24,129 --> 00:00:26,882
We're somehow expected to believe...

9
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:29,849
...because the face is so animated...

10
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:32,921
...they think we're not noticing
the feet are just swinging there.

11
00:00:33,089 --> 00:00:35,159
Dummy feet never look
really right, do they?

12
00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:38,844
They're just kind of dangling there.
Always kind of askew, you know.

13
00:00:39,009 --> 00:00:40,362
You always see a little ankle.

14
00:00:40,529 --> 00:00:43,441
Those little thin, fabric ankles
that they have, you know.

15
00:00:43,609 --> 00:00:46,328
You think,
"I don't think this thing is real."

16
00:00:49,529 --> 00:00:51,485
Are you kidding me?

17
00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:53,765
Let me speak with the head librarian.
It's absurd.

18
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:59,998
An overdue book from 1971?

19
00:01:00,169 --> 00:01:03,002
This is a joke, right? What are you,
from a radio station?

20
00:01:03,169 --> 00:01:06,764
Okay, you got me. I fell for it.

21
00:01:07,169 --> 00:01:08,568
All right. Okay.

22
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:11,004
I can be down there
in, like, a half-hour.

23
00:01:11,169 --> 00:01:12,363
Bye.

24
00:01:12,849 --> 00:01:15,124
- What's the problem?
- This, you're not gonna believe.

25
00:01:15,289 --> 00:01:17,723
The New York Public Library...

26
00:01:17,889 --> 00:01:22,360
...says that I took out
Tropic of Cancer in 1971...

27
00:01:22,529 --> 00:01:24,087
...and never returned it.

28
00:01:24,249 --> 00:01:26,809
Do you know how much
that comes to?

29
00:01:27,009 --> 00:01:29,364
That's a nickel a day for 20 years.

30
00:01:29,529 --> 00:01:31,804
- It's gonna be $50,000.
- It doesn't work like that.

31
00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:33,880
If it's a dime a day,
it could be 100,000.

32
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:35,641
It's not gonna be anything.

33
00:01:35,809 --> 00:01:38,164
I returned the book.
I remember it very vividly...

34
00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:40,126
...because I was with Sherry Becker.

35
00:01:40,289 --> 00:01:43,645
She wore this orange dress. It's the
first time I saw her in a dress like that.

36
00:01:43,809 --> 00:01:47,006
I'd known her since ninth grade. She
was developing this body in secret...

37
00:01:47,169 --> 00:01:49,399
...under these loose clothes
for, like, two years.

38
00:01:49,569 --> 00:01:51,048
And then one day...

39
00:01:51,929 --> 00:01:54,045
...this orange dress.

40
00:01:55,089 --> 00:01:58,843
- It's burned in my memory.
- Oh, memory burn, huh?

41
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:01,569
- I wonder whatever happened to her.
- How did they find you?

42
00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:05,404
Oh, computers. They're cracking down
now on overdue books.

43
00:02:05,569 --> 00:02:08,447
The whole thing's
completely ridiculous.

44
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:12,444
It's George. Wait till he finds out we're
going to the library. He'll be thrilled.

45
00:02:12,609 --> 00:02:15,965
- You know, I never got a library card.
- I'm coming down.

46
00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:18,359
It's all a bunch of cheapskates
in there anyway.

47
00:02:18,529 --> 00:02:20,440
People sitting around
reading the newspaper...

48
00:02:20,609 --> 00:02:23,123
...attached to those huge
wooden sticks...

49
00:02:23,289 --> 00:02:25,359
...trying to save a quarter.

50
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:28,124
Look, I gotta go to the library.
You wanna go?

51
00:02:28,289 --> 00:02:30,519
Yeah, yeah. Let's go.

52
00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:42,802
The Dewey Decimal System.
What a scam that was.

53
00:02:42,969 --> 00:02:47,167
Boy, this Dewey guy
really cleaned up on that deal.

54
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:49,320
Where's George?

55
00:02:49,729 --> 00:02:52,482
Look. Trying to save a quarter.

56
00:02:52,649 --> 00:02:56,164
I kind of like those sticks.
I'd like to get them in my house.

57
00:03:01,809 --> 00:03:04,198
This woman's completely
ignoring me.

58
00:03:04,369 --> 00:03:05,722
Look at her.

59
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:09,564
This is a lonely woman
looking for companionship.

60
00:03:10,449 --> 00:03:12,405
A spinster.

61
00:03:12,809 --> 00:03:14,845
Maybe a virgin.

62
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:20,247
Maybe she got hurt a long time ago.
She's a schoolgirl...

63
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:22,525
...there was a boy. It didn't work out.

64
00:03:22,689 --> 00:03:27,558
So now she needs a little tenderness.
She needs a little understanding.

65
00:03:27,729 --> 00:03:29,959
Needs a little Kramer, huh?

66
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:35,488
Then she'll need
a little shot of penicillin.

67
00:03:37,249 --> 00:03:39,001
- Yes?
- Yeah, I called before.

68
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:41,319
I got this notice in the mail.

69
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:46,968
Tropic of Cancer. Henry Miller.

70
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:51,966
This case has been turned over to our
investigations officer, Mr. Bookman.

71
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:53,323
Bookman?

72
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:56,765
The library investigator's name is
actually Bookman?

73
00:03:56,929 --> 00:03:58,203
- Come on.
- It's true.

74
00:03:58,369 --> 00:03:59,563
That's amazing.

75
00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:02,687
That's like an ice-cream man
named Cone.

76
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:05,204
Well, Lieutenant Bookman's
been working here 25 years...

77
00:04:05,369 --> 00:04:06,688
...so he's heard all the jokes.

78
00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:09,523
- Can I speak with this Bookman?
- Just a second.

79
00:04:13,009 --> 00:04:15,159
Jerry.

80
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:16,683
What?

81
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:18,848
I think I saw him.

82
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:20,920
- I think it's him.
- Who?

83
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:23,319
Did you see the homeless guy
on the library steps...

84
00:04:23,489 --> 00:04:25,684
...screaming obscenities
and doing callisthenics?

85
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:29,000
- Yeah.
- I think that's Mr. Heyman.

86
00:04:29,409 --> 00:04:31,001
The gym teacher from our high school.

87
00:04:33,929 --> 00:04:36,523
- Heyman? Are you sure?
- He's older...

88
00:04:36,689 --> 00:04:41,240
...completely covered in filth,
no whistle. But I think it's him.

89
00:04:42,929 --> 00:04:44,920
George got him fired.
He squealed on him.

90
00:04:45,089 --> 00:04:47,284
- Oh, tattletale.
- I didn't tattle.

91
00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:51,481
Well, what did this guy do?
What happened?

92
00:04:51,649 --> 00:04:53,719
There was an incident.
I'd rather not discuss it.

93
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:55,959
- Oh, come on. You can tell me.
- Some other time.

94
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,926
What, tonight?

95
00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:02,843
- I never figured you for a squealer.
- He sang like a canary.

96
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:04,647
- Mr. Bookman's not here.
- Not here?

97
00:05:04,809 --> 00:05:07,960
- Why was I told to come down here?
- He'll be out all afternoon on a case.

98
00:05:08,129 --> 00:05:11,166
He's out on a case?
He actually goes out on cases?

99
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:13,408
What am I supposed to do now?

100
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:15,446
I'll have Mr. Bookman
get in touch with you.

101
00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:17,927
All right. Thanks.

102
00:05:18,089 --> 00:05:20,239
- Come on, let's go.
- Let's go see if it's Heyman.

103
00:05:20,409 --> 00:05:24,402
- It's not him.
- Hey, I'll see you boys later, huh?

104
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:32,927
So, what's a guy gotta do around here
to get a library card?

105
00:05:43,489 --> 00:05:46,162
- Where's Karen?
- She went to pick up lunch.

106
00:05:47,489 --> 00:05:48,683
Well...

107
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:51,804
...she didn't ask me what I wanted.

108
00:05:51,969 --> 00:05:54,199
She must've forgot.

109
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:57,125
How could she forget?
I've been ordering lunch...

110
00:05:57,289 --> 00:05:59,007
...every day for three and a half years.

111
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:01,686
Is there something
you're not telling me...

112
00:06:01,849 --> 00:06:03,965
...because I'm getting, like,
a really weird vibe.

113
00:06:05,209 --> 00:06:07,245
Is Lippman getting rid of me?
You can tell me.

114
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:10,003
- I won't say anything.
- I don't know anything.

115
00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:13,439
You don't know. You see,
"I don't know anything"...

116
00:06:13,609 --> 00:06:16,521
...means there's something to know.
If you really didn't, you'd say:

117
00:06:16,689 --> 00:06:18,281
"You're crazy."

118
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:21,327
- Oh, hi, Mr. Lippman.
- Elaine.

119
00:06:22,809 --> 00:06:24,845
I was wondering
if you got a chance...

120
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:27,967
...to look at that biography
of Columbus I gave you.

121
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:29,926
Yes, I did.

122
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:32,960
Yes, I did.

123
00:06:34,209 --> 00:06:38,282
- Marie, this water is still too cold.
- Oh, yeah. It's freezing.

124
00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:42,439
Hurts your teeth.

125
00:06:47,329 --> 00:06:49,479
I'm telling you,
something is going on.

126
00:06:49,649 --> 00:06:53,119
He never likes anything I recommend,
and then that lunch thing.

127
00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:55,325
So they forgot to get your lunch.
Big deal.

128
00:06:55,489 --> 00:06:58,208
What do you know?
You've never worked in an office.

129
00:06:58,369 --> 00:07:00,724
See, you've worked in an office,
George. You understand.

130
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:04,120
Jerry thinks I'm overreacting,
but you understand lunch.

131
00:07:04,489 --> 00:07:06,923
I don't understand lunch.
I don't know anything about it.

132
00:07:07,289 --> 00:07:10,838
Just because I got the guy fired doesn't
mean I turned him into a bum, does it?

133
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:12,488
- What did he do?
- He purposely...

134
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:14,401
...mispronounced my name.

135
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:16,366
Instead of saying Costanza...

136
00:07:16,529 --> 00:07:20,761
...he'd say, "Can't stand you.
Can't stand you."

137
00:07:21,289 --> 00:07:24,167
Remember, he made me smell
my own gym socks once?

138
00:07:24,329 --> 00:07:28,083
I remember he made you wear a jock
on your head for a whole class.

139
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:31,680
- And the straps were hanging down...
- Okay, okay.

140
00:07:31,849 --> 00:07:33,248
You never even had him for gym.

141
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:35,798
I had him for hygiene.
Remember his teeth?

142
00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:38,039
It was like from an exhumed corpse.

143
00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:40,923
Little baked beans.

144
00:07:42,369 --> 00:07:45,247
Come on, tell me what happened.

145
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:47,641
Well, okay.

146
00:07:47,809 --> 00:07:50,277
As I said, the guy had it in for me.

147
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:53,998
He actually failed me in gym. Me.

148
00:07:54,529 --> 00:07:57,407
And those spastic Schnitzer twins.

149
00:07:57,689 --> 00:07:59,919
- Can't stand you!
- Yes, Mr. Heyman?

150
00:08:00,089 --> 00:08:03,081
Your underwear was sticking out
of your shorts during gym class.

151
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,240
Well, that's because
I wear boxer shorts.

152
00:08:05,409 --> 00:08:07,001
Boxer shorts, huh?

153
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:09,239
- What brand?
- I'm not really sure. I-

154
00:08:09,409 --> 00:08:11,684
Yeah, well, let's take a look!

155
00:08:12,849 --> 00:08:14,362
He gave me a wedgie.

156
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:16,599
And he got fired the next day.

157
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:18,362
Why do they call it a "wedgie"?

158
00:08:18,529 --> 00:08:22,078
Because the underwear is pulled up
from the back until it...

159
00:08:22,249 --> 00:08:24,080
...wedges in.

160
00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:27,488
They also have an atomic wedgie.

161
00:08:27,649 --> 00:08:30,880
Now, the goal there is to actually
get the waistband...

162
00:08:31,049 --> 00:08:33,085
...on top of the head.

163
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:35,280
It's very rare.

164
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:38,877
- Boys are sick.
- Well, what do girls do?

165
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:42,724
We just tease someone till they
develop an eating disorder.

166
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:46,165
I gotta go back to the library
and talk to him.

167
00:08:46,329 --> 00:08:49,162
I gotta find out if I'm the guy
that ruined his life.

168
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:51,160
Hey, babaloo, you better get home.

169
00:08:51,329 --> 00:08:54,002
This guy Bookman from the library,
he's waiting for you.

170
00:08:54,969 --> 00:08:56,448
What's amazing about the library...

171
00:08:56,609 --> 00:08:58,440
...is here's a place
where you can go in...

172
00:08:58,609 --> 00:09:01,123
...take out any book you want.
They just give it to you...

173
00:09:01,289 --> 00:09:03,757
...and say, "Bring it back
when you're done."

174
00:09:03,929 --> 00:09:06,523
Reminds you of that pathetic friend
everybody had as a kid...

175
00:09:06,689 --> 00:09:10,238
...that would let you borrow any of his
stuff if you would just be his friend.

176
00:09:10,409 --> 00:09:14,197
That's what the library is. It's
a government-funded pathetic friend.

177
00:09:14,369 --> 00:09:16,280
That's why everybody
bullies the library.

178
00:09:16,449 --> 00:09:18,679
"I'll bring it back on time,
I'll bring it back late.

179
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:21,204
What are you gonna do,
charge me a nickel?"

180
00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:25,284
I'm glad you're here so we can
straighten this out.

181
00:09:25,449 --> 00:09:26,802
- Cup of tea?
- Got any coffee?

182
00:09:26,969 --> 00:09:28,038
- Coffee?
- Yeah, coffee.

183
00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:30,040
- No, I don't drink coffee.
- You don't?

184
00:09:30,209 --> 00:09:31,961
- How about instant coffee?
- No, I don't-

185
00:09:32,129 --> 00:09:33,881
- No instant coffee?
- Well, I don't-

186
00:09:34,049 --> 00:09:36,085
- Who doesn't have instant coffee?
- I don't.

187
00:09:36,249 --> 00:09:39,480
Buy a jar of Folgers crystals, put it in
the cupboard, you forget about it.

188
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:41,605
When you need it, it's there.
It lasts forever.

189
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:44,237
It's freeze-dried.
Freeze-dried crystals.

190
00:09:45,809 --> 00:09:47,481
Really? I'll have to remember that.

191
00:09:47,809 --> 00:09:51,119
- You took this book out in 1971.
- Yes, and I returned it in 1971.

192
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:53,678
Yeah, '71, that was my first year
on the job.

193
00:09:53,849 --> 00:09:56,443
Bad year for libraries.
Bad year for America.

194
00:09:57,089 --> 00:09:58,920
Hippies burning library cards.

195
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:01,649
Abbie Hoffman telling everybody
to steal books.

196
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:04,278
I don't judge a man by hair length
or musical taste.

197
00:10:04,449 --> 00:10:05,643
Rock was never my bag.

198
00:10:05,969 --> 00:10:09,041
But you put on a pair of shoes
in the New York Public Library, fella.

199
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:11,359
Look, Mr. Bookman...

200
00:10:13,089 --> 00:10:15,762
...I returned that book.
I remember it very specifically.

201
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:17,885
You're a comedian.
You make people laugh.

202
00:10:18,049 --> 00:10:20,563
- I try.
- You think this is all a big joke?

203
00:10:22,369 --> 00:10:23,768
No, I don't.

204
00:10:23,929 --> 00:10:26,523
I saw you on TV once.
I remembered your name from my list.

205
00:10:26,689 --> 00:10:29,078
I looked it up.
Sure enough, it checked out.

206
00:10:29,249 --> 00:10:32,241
You think because you're a celebrity,
somehow the law doesn't apply?

207
00:10:32,409 --> 00:10:34,161
- You're above the law?
- Certainly not.

208
00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:36,763
Well, let me tell you something,
funny boy.

209
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:40,241
You know that little stamp, the one
that says "New York Public Library"?

210
00:10:40,409 --> 00:10:41,888
That may not mean anything to you.

211
00:10:42,049 --> 00:10:44,438
But that means a lot to me.
One whole hell of a lot.

212
00:10:44,609 --> 00:10:47,681
Sure, go ahead. Laugh if you want to.
I've seen your type before.

213
00:10:47,849 --> 00:10:51,478
Flashy, making a scene,
flaunting convention.

214
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:53,162
Yeah, I know what you're thinking:

215
00:10:53,329 --> 00:10:55,968
"Why's this guy making such a stink
about old library books?"

216
00:10:56,529 --> 00:10:58,997
Well, let me give you a hint, junior.

217
00:10:59,489 --> 00:11:02,561
Maybe we can live without libraries,
people like you and me. Maybe.

218
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:04,765
Sure, we're too old
to change the world.

219
00:11:04,929 --> 00:11:07,807
But what about that kid sitting down
opening a book right now...

220
00:11:07,969 --> 00:11:09,880
...in a branch at the local library...

221
00:11:10,049 --> 00:11:13,405
...and finding drawings
of pee-pees and wee-wees...

222
00:11:15,169 --> 00:11:18,798
...in The Cat in the Hat
and The Five Chinese Brothers?

223
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,163
Doesn't he deserve better?

224
00:11:20,329 --> 00:11:23,480
Look, if you think this is about
overdue fines and missing books...

225
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:26,209
...you better think again.
This is about that kid's right...

226
00:11:26,369 --> 00:11:28,599
...to read a book without
getting his mind warped.

227
00:11:28,769 --> 00:11:30,805
Or maybe that turns you on, Seinfeld.

228
00:11:30,969 --> 00:11:34,723
Maybe that's how you get your kicks,
you and your good-time buddies.

229
00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:37,722
Well, I got a flash for you, joy-boy:

230
00:11:40,969 --> 00:11:42,197
Party time is over.

231
00:11:43,249 --> 00:11:45,922
You got seven days, Seinfeld.

232
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:48,679
That is one week.

233
00:11:53,489 --> 00:11:56,799
- What's wrong?
- It's Bookman, the library cop.

234
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:59,968
- So? I didn't do anything wrong.
- I'm supposed to be at work.

235
00:12:00,129 --> 00:12:03,439
I could get fired.
I never should've come here.

236
00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:07,078
Why don't you leave?

237
00:12:10,289 --> 00:12:12,678
I can't.

238
00:12:14,129 --> 00:12:18,839
There's no way I'm paying that!
I returned that book in 1971!

239
00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:21,364
I have a witness. Sherry Becker.

240
00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:23,918
She wore an orange dress.

241
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:25,727
She gave me a piece
of Black Jack gum.

242
00:12:25,889 --> 00:12:29,120
I said, "Liquorice gum.
What will they think of next?"

243
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:30,927
I remember it!

244
00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:38,279
Becker, Becker...

245
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:51,607
Kevin went to a public school.

246
00:12:51,769 --> 00:12:53,248
He's the 14 year old.

247
00:12:53,409 --> 00:12:56,321
We were gonna send Marsha
to a private school...

248
00:12:56,729 --> 00:12:59,323
...because in some ways, they don't...

249
00:12:59,489 --> 00:13:02,208
...learn enough, I think.

250
00:13:02,369 --> 00:13:05,884
So, Sherry, what do you remember
about that day at the library?

251
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:09,566
I remember it like it was yesterday.

252
00:13:09,729 --> 00:13:11,640
It was a Friday afternoon.

253
00:13:11,809 --> 00:13:15,040
- I wore a purple dress.
- Purple?

254
00:13:15,209 --> 00:13:17,723
- You sure it wasn't orange?
- Positive.

255
00:13:17,889 --> 00:13:20,608
And I was chewing Dentyne.

256
00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:23,806
I always chewed Dentyne.

257
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,847
Remember, Jerry? Dentyne?

258
00:13:28,489 --> 00:13:32,277
- No Black Jack?
- Liquorice gum? Never.

259
00:13:32,449 --> 00:13:34,201
What else?

260
00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:35,723
We were...

261
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:39,962
...reading passages to each other
from that Henry Miller book you had.

262
00:13:40,129 --> 00:13:42,689
- Tropic of Cancer.
- No.

263
00:13:42,849 --> 00:13:44,441
Tropic of Capricorn.

264
00:13:44,969 --> 00:13:49,008
- Tropic of Capricorn?
- Remember?

265
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,638
"What holds the world together...

266
00:13:51,809 --> 00:13:55,882
...as I have learned from
bitter experience...

267
00:13:56,049 --> 00:13:59,121
...is sexual intercourse."

268
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:05,885
Wait a second, wait a second.
You're right. I had both of them.

269
00:14:06,049 --> 00:14:07,607
We read from Tropic of Capricorn.

270
00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:11,648
I was all set to return Tropic of Cancer.
And then...

271
00:14:12,689 --> 00:14:14,486
- George, here's the book.
- Oh, man.

272
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:17,083
Don't let anybody see it.
Don't let anything happen to it.

273
00:14:17,249 --> 00:14:19,843
Jerry, it's me, George. Don't worry.
I'll return it tomorrow.

274
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:23,319
All right. I'll see you after school.
I'm late for Heyman's hygiene.

275
00:14:25,249 --> 00:14:27,922
- Where are you going?
- It was nice seeing you again.

276
00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:30,000
I just remembered something.
I've gotta go.

277
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:33,524
It was George!

278
00:14:35,489 --> 00:14:37,286
Read another poem.

279
00:14:37,569 --> 00:14:41,448
Pressed chest
Fleshed out west

280
00:14:41,609 --> 00:14:43,600
Might be the saviour

281
00:14:43,769 --> 00:14:45,407
Or a garden pest

282
00:14:46,609 --> 00:14:50,158
That is great poetry.
You should be published.

283
00:14:50,329 --> 00:14:52,206
It's great.

284
00:14:54,569 --> 00:14:57,083
Well, the library's kind of a cool place
when it's closed.

285
00:14:57,249 --> 00:14:59,638
Oh, yeah. You don't have to be quiet.

286
00:14:59,809 --> 00:15:01,322
Listen to the echo.

287
00:15:01,489 --> 00:15:03,241
- Hello!
- Hello!

288
00:15:03,409 --> 00:15:05,684
- Hello!
- Hello!

289
00:15:05,849 --> 00:15:07,328
- Hello!
- Hello.

290
00:15:10,769 --> 00:15:11,963
Mr. Bookman.

291
00:15:12,129 --> 00:15:15,485
I remember when the librarian was
a much older woman.

292
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:18,209
Kindly, discreet, unattractive.

293
00:15:18,809 --> 00:15:20,765
We didn't know anything
about her private life.

294
00:15:20,929 --> 00:15:22,999
We didn't wanna know
about her private life.

295
00:15:23,169 --> 00:15:25,558
She didn't have a private life.

296
00:15:25,729 --> 00:15:27,640
When you think about that,
think about this:

297
00:15:27,809 --> 00:15:30,369
The library closes at 5:00,
no exceptions.

298
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:32,201
This is your final warning.

299
00:15:32,369 --> 00:15:34,678
Got that, kewpie doll?

300
00:15:38,609 --> 00:15:41,203
Lippman wants to see me
in his office.

301
00:15:41,369 --> 00:15:45,078
- See me. That can't be good.
- Maybe you're getting a raise.

302
00:15:45,249 --> 00:15:47,638
Maybe I'm getting a wedgie.

303
00:15:51,009 --> 00:15:52,965
- What?
- It's George.

304
00:15:53,129 --> 00:15:57,202
- George is on his way up.
- Wait till I tell him about the book.

305
00:15:58,609 --> 00:16:00,406
Are you okay?

306
00:16:00,569 --> 00:16:05,723
- What?
- It's- It's Marion's poetry.

307
00:16:05,889 --> 00:16:09,404
- I can't take it!
- Oh, Kramer.

308
00:16:13,569 --> 00:16:16,129
Remember that biography
I recommended?

309
00:16:16,289 --> 00:16:18,678
- My boss hated it!
- I'm right here.

310
00:16:18,849 --> 00:16:20,760
Oh, sorry.

311
00:16:21,569 --> 00:16:25,881
- Remember that Columbus book?
- Columbus. Eurotrash.

312
00:16:37,689 --> 00:16:39,964
Well, it's definitely him.

313
00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:45,399
- Him? Him who?
- Him who?

314
00:16:45,569 --> 00:16:47,321
Heyman him.

315
00:16:47,489 --> 00:16:49,241
Heyman, the gym teacher?

316
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:52,242
- You found him?
- Oh, I found him.

317
00:16:52,409 --> 00:16:54,525
He was sitting on the steps
of the library.

318
00:16:54,689 --> 00:16:55,963
I sat down next to him.

319
00:16:56,729 --> 00:16:59,641
He smelled like the locker room
after that game against Erasmus.

320
00:16:59,809 --> 00:17:01,686
That was double overtime.

321
00:17:01,929 --> 00:17:03,601
I said, "Mr. Heyman...

322
00:17:03,769 --> 00:17:06,283
...it's me, George Costanza.

323
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:08,883
JFK, '71."

324
00:17:09,049 --> 00:17:10,926
He doesn't move.

325
00:17:11,129 --> 00:17:12,767
So I said:

326
00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:16,922
"Can't stand you. Can't stand you."

327
00:17:17,289 --> 00:17:19,883
He turns and smiles.

328
00:17:20,049 --> 00:17:22,688
The little baked-bean teeth.

329
00:17:23,169 --> 00:17:25,239
I get up to run away...

330
00:17:25,409 --> 00:17:28,719
...but something was holding me back.

331
00:17:29,569 --> 00:17:31,480
It was Heyman.

332
00:17:33,249 --> 00:17:35,001
He had my underwear.

333
00:17:37,729 --> 00:17:42,519
Here I was on the steps
of the 42nd Street library...

334
00:17:42,689 --> 00:17:44,884
...a grown man...

335
00:17:45,569 --> 00:17:47,400
...getting a wedgie.

336
00:17:49,729 --> 00:17:51,128
At least it wasn't atomic.

337
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:55,080
It was.

338
00:17:58,889 --> 00:18:03,007
So, Georgie boy, guess what
happened to Tropic of Cancer.

339
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:05,478
- How should I know?
- Because I gave it to you.

340
00:18:05,649 --> 00:18:06,843
- Me?
- Yeah, think.

341
00:18:07,009 --> 00:18:09,284
Don't you remember?
You kept begging me to see it.

342
00:18:09,449 --> 00:18:11,167
Then finally, I agreed.

343
00:18:11,529 --> 00:18:14,123
You were supposed to return it.

344
00:18:14,289 --> 00:18:17,247
I met you in the gym locker room
and gave it to you.

345
00:18:18,209 --> 00:18:19,403
The locker room.

346
00:18:20,129 --> 00:18:22,006
- George, here's the book.
- Oh, man.

347
00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:24,603
Don't let anybody see it.
Don't let anything happen to it.

348
00:18:24,769 --> 00:18:27,078
It's me, George. Don't worry.
I'll return it tomorrow.

349
00:18:27,249 --> 00:18:30,764
All right. I'll see you after school.
I'm late for Heyman's hygiene.

350
00:18:34,529 --> 00:18:36,565
- Can't stand you!
- Yes, Mr. Heyman?

351
00:18:36,729 --> 00:18:40,039
Your underwear was sticking out
of your shorts during gym class.

352
00:18:40,209 --> 00:18:43,326
- That's because I wear boxer shorts.
- Boxer shorts, huh?

353
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:45,559
- What brand?
- I'm not really sure.

354
00:18:45,729 --> 00:18:47,959
Yeah, well, let's take a look!

355
00:19:00,369 --> 00:19:03,805
Anyway, I hope there's
no hard feelings.

356
00:19:05,409 --> 00:19:08,560
Hard feelings? What do you know
about hard feelings?

357
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,766
Ever have a man die in your arms?
Ever kill somebody?

358
00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:15,999
- What is your problem?
- What's my problem?

359
00:19:16,169 --> 00:19:18,808
Punks like you. That's my problem.

360
00:19:18,969 --> 00:19:20,607
You better not
screw up again, Seinfeld.

361
00:19:20,769 --> 00:19:23,806
Because if you do, I'll be all over you
like a pit bull on a poodle.

362
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:29,967
That is one tough monkey.

363
00:19:30,849 --> 00:19:34,683
- So you were saying?
- So I took your suggestion...

364
00:19:34,849 --> 00:19:37,079
...and I gave my boss
Marion's poems...

365
00:19:37,249 --> 00:19:39,001
...the ones that affected
Kramer so much.

366
00:19:39,169 --> 00:19:43,128
- Oh, beautiful. Did he like them?
- No, he didn't.

367
00:19:44,489 --> 00:19:47,208
No, he didn't.

368
00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:51,966
- Was he out there?
- No, he's gone.

369
00:19:52,449 --> 00:19:56,283
- I wonder what happened to him.
- I guess we'll never know.

370
00:20:03,009 --> 00:20:04,442
Can't stand you.

371
00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:09,046
Can't stand you. Can't stand you.

372
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:11,769
Can't stand you.

373
00:20:13,609 --> 00:20:15,884
Any day that you had gym...

374
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:18,165
...was a weird school day.

375
00:20:18,329 --> 00:20:20,524
You know what I mean?
It started off kind of normal.

376
00:20:20,689 --> 00:20:23,487
You have, like, English, geometry,
social studies...

377
00:20:23,649 --> 00:20:26,721
...and then suddenly, you're, like,
in Lord of the Flies for 40 minutes.

378
00:20:26,889 --> 00:20:29,961
You're hanging from a rope.
You have hardly any clothes on.

379
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:33,405
Teachers are yelling at you,
"Where's your jockstrap?"You know.

380
00:20:33,569 --> 00:20:37,687
Kids are throwing dodge balls at you.
You're trying to survive.

381
00:20:38,129 --> 00:20:39,801
Then it's history...

382
00:20:39,969 --> 00:20:41,766
...science, language.

383
00:20:41,929 --> 00:20:45,080
There's something off
in the whole flow of that day.

384
00:21:30,729 --> 00:21:32,720
