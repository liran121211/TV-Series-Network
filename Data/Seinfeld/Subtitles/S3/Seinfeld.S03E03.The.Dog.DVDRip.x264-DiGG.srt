1
00:00:02,449 --> 00:00:03,882
So I'm on the plane. We left late.

2
00:00:05,209 --> 00:00:08,963
Pilot says, "We're going to be making
up some time."Isn't that interesting?

3
00:00:09,129 --> 00:00:10,323
They just make up time.

4
00:00:10,489 --> 00:00:12,286
That's why you have to
reset your watch.

5
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:14,725
Of course when they say
they're making up time...

6
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:18,404
...obviously, they're increasing
the speed of the aircraft.

7
00:00:18,569 --> 00:00:21,481
Now my question is,
if you can go faster...

8
00:00:21,649 --> 00:00:24,527
...why don't you just go
as fast as you can...

9
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:26,247
...all the time?

10
00:00:26,409 --> 00:00:30,118
Come on. There's no cops up here.
Nail it. Give it some gas.

11
00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:32,359
We're flying.

12
00:00:36,609 --> 00:00:39,203
Travelling, of course,
is the best education.

13
00:00:39,369 --> 00:00:40,563
You know, last year...

14
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:46,561
...I was ill for 40, 45 countries...

15
00:00:46,729 --> 00:00:50,608
...and I would've gone to more,
but I'd just got a puppy.

16
00:00:50,769 --> 00:00:52,964
And he was too young
to take with me.

17
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:55,563
But not now.
I won't travel without him.

18
00:00:55,729 --> 00:00:58,118
- Is he on the plane now?
- Oh, yes.

19
00:00:59,249 --> 00:01:01,683
Yes, he's in
the baggage compartment.

20
00:01:01,849 --> 00:01:05,239
I don't know why they won't
let him sit up here with me.

21
00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:08,048
He's a lot better behaved
than most of the dregs...

22
00:01:08,209 --> 00:01:10,518
...you find onboard here.

23
00:01:13,209 --> 00:01:14,927
You have any pets?

24
00:01:15,089 --> 00:01:16,522
Just my next-door neighbour.

25
00:01:16,689 --> 00:01:17,917
Well...

26
00:01:18,089 --> 00:01:20,398
...you are missing out
on a relationship...

27
00:01:20,569 --> 00:01:24,960
...that could enrich your life in ways
that you never even thought possible.

28
00:01:25,129 --> 00:01:28,280
How about picking up their-?
You know.

29
00:01:28,449 --> 00:01:30,360
You find that enriching?

30
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:35,564
- What's the matter?
- Oh, I'm feeling a bit...

31
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,208
...queasy.

32
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:41,328
Sir, we're gonna make
an emergency landing in Chicago...

33
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:43,320
...and get you to a hospital.

34
00:01:43,849 --> 00:01:45,805
My dog.

35
00:01:45,969 --> 00:01:47,368
What about my dog?

36
00:01:47,529 --> 00:01:48,848
You have a dog?

37
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:50,886
Do you know anyone
on the plane, Mr. Palone?

38
00:01:56,129 --> 00:01:58,120
Jerry.

39
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:00,088
How you feeling?

40
00:02:00,249 --> 00:02:02,888
Would you take care of Farfel?

41
00:02:03,889 --> 00:02:05,117
Farfel?

42
00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:08,087
It's his dog. We're landing in
Chicago to get him to a hospital.

43
00:02:08,249 --> 00:02:11,878
- Could you take his dog to New York?
- The dog?

44
00:02:12,289 --> 00:02:14,757
- The dog?
- I'm sure it's only for a day or two.

45
00:02:15,089 --> 00:02:16,841
But, you know-
What if, you know...?

46
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:19,398
Give me your address
and phone number. I'll call you.

47
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,368
The dog?

48
00:02:25,689 --> 00:02:27,088
Let go, Farfel.

49
00:02:27,249 --> 00:02:28,887
Let go. Give me that.

50
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:32,121
Give me that sneaker,
you stupid idiot.

51
00:02:33,729 --> 00:02:35,242
Shut up!

52
00:02:36,249 --> 00:02:37,477
So, what would you do?

53
00:02:37,649 --> 00:02:40,368
It's only been three days.
I'm sure he's gonna call.

54
00:02:41,169 --> 00:02:43,603
Stop it! Shut up!

55
00:02:45,169 --> 00:02:47,729
Do you believe this?
Do you believe what I'm dealing with?

56
00:02:47,889 --> 00:02:49,720
I got a wild animal in the house.

57
00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:53,359
He'd deranged. Maybe he's got
rabies. I can get lockjaw.

58
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:56,848
- If only.
- Look at this place.

59
00:02:58,009 --> 00:02:59,442
He's going everywhere.

60
00:02:59,609 --> 00:03:02,806
I can't go out of the house at night.
I haven't performed in three days.

61
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:05,278
This will be my first night out
since I got back.

62
00:03:05,449 --> 00:03:08,361
Hey, when you walk him, do you...?

63
00:03:09,169 --> 00:03:10,397
Do I what?

64
00:03:11,089 --> 00:03:13,444
Do you pick it up?

65
00:03:15,009 --> 00:03:17,125
Yes, I pick it up.

66
00:03:17,289 --> 00:03:19,564
- You pick it up?
- Well, you have to.

67
00:03:19,729 --> 00:03:22,448
Oh, boy, would I love to see that.

68
00:03:24,969 --> 00:03:26,482
Shut up!

69
00:03:26,649 --> 00:03:28,844
Shut up, Farfel! Stop it!

70
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:30,442
I don't know what to do.

71
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:33,442
What if I take it to the pound,
then the guy shows up?

72
00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:36,043
You should call the airline.
They might know where he is.

73
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:39,246
No, I tried. They don't know anything.
You gotta put the syrup in first.

74
00:03:39,409 --> 00:03:41,604
- No, milk.
- I'm telling you. The guy's a drunk.

75
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:43,725
He's probably on a bender.

76
00:03:44,449 --> 00:03:46,405
What is a bender anyhow?

77
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:49,800
I don't know. They drink and they
bend things at the bar. I don't know.

78
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:53,644
I can't believe he hasn't called.

79
00:03:53,809 --> 00:03:55,367
Two hundred seats on a plane...

80
00:03:55,529 --> 00:03:58,965
...I gotta wind up next to Yukon Jack
and his dog Cujo.

81
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:02,397
Shut up!

82
00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:04,878
One more day,
and you are pound-bound!

83
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:07,400
Hey, I'm sorry. I can't
watch the dog tonight.

84
00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:09,560
- Why?
- We're going to the movies.

85
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:11,367
We're gonna see
Prognosis Negative.

86
00:04:11,529 --> 00:04:13,485
I can't. I gotta get this Ellen
out of my life.

87
00:04:13,649 --> 00:04:16,288
- You're breaking up?
- Oh, yeah.

88
00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:18,724
The sooner the better.
I can't wait to do it.

89
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:21,164
You know some people
you worry about whether or not...

90
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:24,446
...you're gonna hurt their feelings?
With her, I'm looking forward to it.

91
00:04:24,609 --> 00:04:26,008
Boy, I'd like to get it on video.

92
00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:28,046
Watch it in slow motion
and freeze-frame it.

93
00:04:31,609 --> 00:04:34,043
Kramer, I don't know how you
lasted as long as you did.

94
00:04:34,329 --> 00:04:35,557
You didn't like her?

95
00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:38,038
If you could see her personality...

96
00:04:38,209 --> 00:04:40,359
...it'd be like one of the
Elephant Man exhibits...

97
00:04:40,529 --> 00:04:43,202
...where they pull off the sheet
and everyone gasps.

98
00:04:43,369 --> 00:04:46,122
I can't believe someone
hasn't killed her yet.

99
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:48,002
How come you never said anything?

100
00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:50,763
You can't tell someone how you feel
about their girlfriend...

101
00:04:50,929 --> 00:04:52,681
- ... till after they stop-
- I tell you.

102
00:04:52,849 --> 00:04:54,919
You. I'm talking about people.

103
00:04:56,849 --> 00:04:58,601
Are we still going
to the movies tonight?

104
00:04:58,769 --> 00:05:01,761
No, I can't. I gotta watch Farfel.
You and George can go without me.

105
00:05:02,209 --> 00:05:04,484
- Just me and George?
- Sure.

106
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:05,923
But we need you.

107
00:05:06,089 --> 00:05:07,681
What do you need me for?

108
00:05:08,929 --> 00:05:10,567
Because.

109
00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:15,041
- Yeah?
- Prognosis Negative.

110
00:05:15,769 --> 00:05:18,522
Because I relate to George
through you.

111
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:20,247
We're more like...

112
00:05:20,409 --> 00:05:24,197
...friends-in-law. Besides, we said
we'd see Prognosis Negative together.

113
00:05:24,369 --> 00:05:26,439
Can't you put some newspapers
down or something?

114
00:05:26,609 --> 00:05:30,204
No, I can't trust him. He gets insane.
I won't enjoy myself.

115
00:05:30,849 --> 00:05:33,317
That's right, Farfel,
I'm talking about you!

116
00:05:33,969 --> 00:05:36,483
Just me and George alone?

117
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:41,727
Let's go, people. Let's go.
It's Prognosis Negative time.

118
00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:43,562
I can't go.

119
00:05:43,929 --> 00:05:46,921
- You can't go? Why not?
- Because I have to watch idiot Farfel.

120
00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:50,486
- I thought Kramer was watching him.
- He's breaking up with his girlfriend.

121
00:05:50,649 --> 00:05:52,526
What's the problem?
Just put newspaper down.

122
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:54,725
No, I don't want that smell
in the house.

123
00:05:54,889 --> 00:05:57,119
- You spritz a little Lysol on it-
- No.

124
00:05:57,289 --> 00:05:58,768
It's like BO and cologne.

125
00:05:58,929 --> 00:06:03,081
They combine forces into some kind
of strange mutant funk.

126
00:06:03,249 --> 00:06:04,523
So we're not going?

127
00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:06,247
Nah. You two go.

128
00:06:10,129 --> 00:06:11,881
You still wanna go?

129
00:06:12,809 --> 00:06:14,720
Do you?

130
00:06:15,049 --> 00:06:16,482
If you want.

131
00:06:17,249 --> 00:06:19,080
- It's- It's up to you.
- Go ahead.

132
00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:25,038
Well, I really wanted to see
Prognosis Negative with Jerry.

133
00:06:25,209 --> 00:06:27,677
You wanna see Ponce de Leon?

134
00:06:27,849 --> 00:06:29,965
Ponce de Leon?

135
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:31,722
Okay.

136
00:06:32,369 --> 00:06:34,837
- You sure you don't wanna go?
- I want to, but I can't.

137
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:37,079
Oh! I tell you what.

138
00:06:37,249 --> 00:06:40,286
How about if I come back here first
and I clean everything up?

139
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:43,122
And I open up the windows,
and if you're still not satisfied...

140
00:06:43,289 --> 00:06:46,281
- ... we switch apartments for the night.
- No.

141
00:06:47,729 --> 00:06:49,959
- What about this-?
- Forget it.

142
00:06:50,129 --> 00:06:52,165
Go ahead. You'll have a good time.

143
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:55,082
- I know. It's not that.
- I just want you to go.

144
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:57,485
Well, thank you very much.

145
00:06:58,129 --> 00:07:01,485
I'm telling you, one more day,
stink breath!

146
00:07:01,649 --> 00:07:04,038
On my block, a lot of people
walk their dogs...

147
00:07:04,209 --> 00:07:07,565
...and I always see them walking
along with their little poop bags...

148
00:07:07,729 --> 00:07:10,448
...which to me is just
the lowest function of human life.

149
00:07:10,609 --> 00:07:14,124
If aliens are watching this
through telescopes...

150
00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:17,167
...they're gonna think the dogs
are the leaders.

151
00:07:17,769 --> 00:07:20,488
If you see two life forms,
one of them is making a poop...

152
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:23,561
...the other one's carrying it for him...

153
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:27,089
Who would you assume
is in charge?

154
00:07:34,289 --> 00:07:35,961
So how long did you live there?

155
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:38,286
About three years.

156
00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:41,967
That's pretty long.

157
00:07:45,649 --> 00:07:47,958
- It's not that long, really.
- Yeah.

158
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:51,007
- Do you-?
- So-

159
00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:55,842
- And then you came here.
- Yeah.

160
00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:00,883
So I've been here about six years.

161
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:06,599
'86, '87, '88, '89, '90...

162
00:08:06,769 --> 00:08:08,999
...'91.

163
00:08:10,689 --> 00:08:11,963
Yep.

164
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:13,403
Bad dog.

165
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:14,763
Bad dog!

166
00:08:14,929 --> 00:08:16,521
You go outside!

167
00:08:16,689 --> 00:08:18,566
Outside!

168
00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:21,084
What do you want from me? Tell me.

169
00:08:21,249 --> 00:08:23,205
Money? You want money?

170
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:25,007
I'll give you money. How much?

171
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:29,321
I must have been out of my mind.
Look at you.

172
00:08:29,489 --> 00:08:32,049
Why don't you do something
with your life?

173
00:08:32,209 --> 00:08:36,521
You sit around here all day.
You contribute nothing to society!

174
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:40,038
You're just taking up space!

175
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:44,279
I mean, how can I be
with someone like you?

176
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:47,162
Wouldn't respect myself.

177
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:50,680
I like herbal tea.

178
00:08:52,969 --> 00:08:55,119
Chamomile's good.

179
00:08:57,409 --> 00:08:59,240
Lemon Lift.

180
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:03,600
Almond Pleasure.

181
00:09:17,209 --> 00:09:19,723
Jerry likes Morning Thunder.

182
00:09:21,849 --> 00:09:24,522
- Jerry drinks Morning Thunder?
- Yeah.

183
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,965
Morning Thunder has caffeine in it.
Jerry doesn't drink caffeine.

184
00:09:28,129 --> 00:09:30,723
Jerry doesn't know
Morning Thunder has caffeine in it.

185
00:09:32,289 --> 00:09:34,280
- You don't tell him?
- No.

186
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,679
And you should see him.
Man, he gets all hyper.

187
00:09:36,849 --> 00:09:38,726
He doesn't even know why.
He loves it.

188
00:09:38,889 --> 00:09:41,483
He walks around going,
"God, I feel great!"

189
00:09:42,969 --> 00:09:45,483
- You don't tell him?
- No.

190
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,319
- That is so funny.
- I know.

191
00:09:49,729 --> 00:09:51,082
Have you ever seen him throw up?

192
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:56,728
Please!

193
00:09:57,649 --> 00:09:59,560
Please!

194
00:10:00,729 --> 00:10:02,287
I take it all back!

195
00:10:02,449 --> 00:10:05,009
Everything. I take it all back!
Every word!

196
00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:07,080
I love you!

197
00:10:07,929 --> 00:10:09,760
I love you!

198
00:10:10,849 --> 00:10:14,125
I can't live without you!
I'll do anything!

199
00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:19,880
That's right. Gavin Palone.

200
00:10:20,049 --> 00:10:22,643
What? You're sure?

201
00:10:22,809 --> 00:10:24,322
He was released on Monday?

202
00:10:24,489 --> 00:10:26,445
Last Monday?

203
00:10:27,289 --> 00:10:29,757
Did he leave a phone number
or address?

204
00:10:30,289 --> 00:10:32,086
Unbelievable.

205
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:35,357
Well, thank you. Thanks.
Thanks very much.

206
00:10:36,049 --> 00:10:39,485
That's it, Farfel. Party's over.

207
00:10:39,649 --> 00:10:44,359
Start packing up your little squeeze
toys, buddy boy. You're checking out.

208
00:10:47,929 --> 00:10:50,762
It was weird because George
and I get along so great...

209
00:10:50,929 --> 00:10:52,157
...in so many situations...

210
00:10:52,329 --> 00:10:54,843
...but this was the first time
we went one-on-one.

211
00:10:55,009 --> 00:10:57,807
One-on-one's a whole
different game. Can't pass off.

212
00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:02,206
The only time it wasn't uncomfortable
was when we were making fun of you.

213
00:11:05,689 --> 00:11:09,159
Hello. Boy George, about time.

214
00:11:09,329 --> 00:11:11,001
Beautiful. How soon?

215
00:11:11,169 --> 00:11:12,682
Okay, here's the plan:

216
00:11:12,849 --> 00:11:16,683
We take the dog to the pound,
we go right to the movies.

217
00:11:16,849 --> 00:11:19,204
Right. You, me and Elaine.

218
00:11:19,729 --> 00:11:21,481
Yes, all three of us.

219
00:11:22,369 --> 00:11:24,439
I am going.

220
00:11:24,609 --> 00:11:26,918
Okay, see you in five minutes.

221
00:11:34,489 --> 00:11:36,127
- What?
- Do you have to?

222
00:11:36,289 --> 00:11:39,087
What am I supposed to do?
I don't want to do it.

223
00:11:39,249 --> 00:11:41,160
I like dogs.

224
00:11:41,329 --> 00:11:43,479
I'm not sure this is a dog.

225
00:11:44,409 --> 00:11:46,525
You know the guy might have
just lost your number.

226
00:11:46,689 --> 00:11:48,998
I'm in the book,
and I have a machine.

227
00:11:49,169 --> 00:11:52,525
Jerry, do you know what they do
to dogs at the pound?

228
00:11:52,689 --> 00:11:56,045
They keep them there for a week.
If nobody claims them, they kill them.

229
00:11:56,209 --> 00:11:57,483
Really?

230
00:11:57,649 --> 00:11:59,401
How late are they open?

231
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,840
- What?
- What is it?

232
00:12:07,289 --> 00:12:09,644
I went back with Ellen.

233
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:12,282
- That's great.
- Great.

234
00:12:13,849 --> 00:12:15,362
- Terrific.
- Yeah.

235
00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:17,520
I really think you guys
are good together.

236
00:12:17,689 --> 00:12:21,648
Yes. She understands you,
and she is not demanding.

237
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:25,563
Do you think that I forgot
what you two said about her?

238
00:12:25,729 --> 00:12:28,197
- We're just trying to be supportive.
- Yes.

239
00:12:28,369 --> 00:12:30,121
- We knew you were upset-
- From now on...

240
00:12:30,289 --> 00:12:33,008
...when we pass each other,
I don't know you, you don't know me.

241
00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:36,117
Oh, Kramer. We didn't mean it.

242
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:38,928
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting my pot.

243
00:12:39,729 --> 00:12:42,118
- Kramer, we like her.
- Kramer...

244
00:12:44,169 --> 00:12:46,524
What did we say that was so bad?

245
00:12:46,689 --> 00:12:51,683
I believe I referred to her personality
as a potential science exhibit.

246
00:12:52,249 --> 00:12:54,888
I said, "How come
no one's killed her?"

247
00:12:56,929 --> 00:12:58,123
- Well.
- Well.

248
00:12:58,289 --> 00:13:00,041
Probably shouldn't have
said anything.

249
00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:02,769
I mean, everybody knows
the first breakup never takes.

250
00:13:05,249 --> 00:13:08,844
- Yeah?
- Prognosis Negative.

251
00:13:11,329 --> 00:13:15,800
Great. Okay, Farfel,
put your shoes on.

252
00:13:17,009 --> 00:13:19,159
Jerry, can't you just give it
one more day?

253
00:13:19,329 --> 00:13:21,843
- It's not his fault.
- It's not my dog.

254
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,886
I don't know where
this booze hound is.

255
00:13:25,769 --> 00:13:27,088
All right, I tell you what.

256
00:13:27,249 --> 00:13:29,683
How about if you and George
go to the movies...

257
00:13:29,849 --> 00:13:31,407
...and I stay here
and watch the dog?

258
00:13:31,569 --> 00:13:34,037
I can't let you do that.
What about Prognosis Negative?

259
00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:36,120
We'll see it Sunday.

260
00:13:37,129 --> 00:13:40,087
Tonight's the night, right?
Prognosis Negative.

261
00:13:40,729 --> 00:13:42,845
I'm not going.
I'm gonna watch the dog.

262
00:13:43,369 --> 00:13:45,087
- What does this mean?
- Well...

263
00:13:45,249 --> 00:13:49,481
...we'll go see something else tonight.
We'll see Ponce de Leon.

264
00:13:49,649 --> 00:13:52,527
What is with this dog? I thought
we were taking it to the pound.

265
00:13:52,689 --> 00:13:54,327
She talked me into one more day.

266
00:13:54,489 --> 00:13:56,127
Talk. I'm going to the bathroom.

267
00:13:56,289 --> 00:13:58,723
Jerry, how long are you
gonna be in there?

268
00:13:59,729 --> 00:14:02,562
I don't know, regular human time.

269
00:14:02,729 --> 00:14:05,118
Why don't you wait
and go at the movies?

270
00:14:07,169 --> 00:14:09,922
- Why shouldn't I go here?
- Well, you know.

271
00:14:10,089 --> 00:14:12,842
Sometimes it's good to get there
and make sure you get seats...

272
00:14:13,009 --> 00:14:14,442
...and then go to the bathroom.

273
00:14:14,609 --> 00:14:16,759
- And isn't it more fun using the urinal?
- Yeah.

274
00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:21,649
Oh, yeah, George. Urinals are fun.

275
00:14:23,409 --> 00:14:25,320
- Can I go?
- Hey, go.

276
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:28,208
- Who's stopping you?
- What, are you doing me a favour?

277
00:14:29,489 --> 00:14:32,049
Like we care if you go
to the bathroom.

278
00:14:37,809 --> 00:14:39,765
- How's it going?
- Good.

279
00:14:41,809 --> 00:14:43,879
- You?
- Things are good.

280
00:14:57,769 --> 00:15:00,841
- Boy, he takes such a long time.
- I know.

281
00:15:02,129 --> 00:15:04,120
You know what he does
in there? He gargles.

282
00:15:04,289 --> 00:15:06,120
Jerry gargles?
That why he takes so long?

283
00:15:06,289 --> 00:15:08,280
Yeah, he does it
like six times a day.

284
00:15:08,689 --> 00:15:11,044
- How come we never hear him?
- Because he does it quiet.

285
00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:14,087
He does it quiet. Lookit-
Just like this. Watch.

286
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:22,562
Wait, wait. Did you ever
see him throw up?

287
00:15:23,649 --> 00:15:25,640
We talked about that already.

288
00:15:29,969 --> 00:15:32,005
I have nothing to say
to anybody anymore.

289
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:34,879
I'm so uninteresting.

290
00:15:35,049 --> 00:15:36,528
I'm think I'm out of conversation.

291
00:15:36,929 --> 00:15:39,159
So why do you call me
six times a day?

292
00:15:39,969 --> 00:15:41,800
All I know about is sports. That's it.

293
00:15:41,969 --> 00:15:44,119
No matter how depressed,
I can always read sports.

294
00:15:44,289 --> 00:15:46,883
I could read the sports section
if my hair was on fire.

295
00:15:48,089 --> 00:15:50,728
You know what,
Ponce de Leon is sold out.

296
00:15:52,249 --> 00:15:54,558
It is. Oh, yeah, you're right.
What else is playing?

297
00:15:54,729 --> 00:15:56,799
Nothing except Prognosis Negative.

298
00:15:58,169 --> 00:16:00,478
Boy, I know she really wants
to see that with me.

299
00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:02,287
Give me that jacket, mud face.

300
00:16:02,449 --> 00:16:04,201
This is not Seinfeld
you're dealing with.

301
00:16:04,369 --> 00:16:07,361
When I get through with you,
you'll be begging to go to the pound.

302
00:16:09,849 --> 00:16:11,202
Shut up.

303
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:13,362
Shut up!

304
00:16:14,289 --> 00:16:16,007
Hello?

305
00:16:16,689 --> 00:16:19,123
No. Who's calling?

306
00:16:21,889 --> 00:16:24,722
Oh, my God. The dog guy.

307
00:16:25,289 --> 00:16:27,007
Well, where have you been?

308
00:16:27,729 --> 00:16:30,197
Yeah? Well, you better pick up
your dog tonight...

309
00:16:30,369 --> 00:16:32,519
...or he has humped his last leg.

310
00:16:35,569 --> 00:16:38,003
I could understand if there was
something else playing...

311
00:16:38,169 --> 00:16:39,966
...but it's this or nothing.

312
00:16:40,409 --> 00:16:43,048
- I don't know what to do.
- What is this saving movies thing?

313
00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:45,564
- Something's playing, you go.
- I know. I know.

314
00:16:45,729 --> 00:16:47,048
So we're gonna do nothing now?

315
00:16:47,209 --> 00:16:48,847
- This is crazy.
- It is kind of silly.

316
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:51,398
- Of course it is.
- I mean, it's just a movie-

317
00:16:51,569 --> 00:16:54,208
- Exactly.
- It's not like she's in the movie.

318
00:16:54,369 --> 00:16:55,563
Right.

319
00:16:55,729 --> 00:16:58,243
We're supposed to ruin the night
because she wants to see it?

320
00:16:58,409 --> 00:17:00,081
If I could have seen it
with her, fine.

321
00:17:00,249 --> 00:17:02,638
But I can't control these
circumstances and schedules...

322
00:17:02,809 --> 00:17:05,198
- ... and people's availabilities.
- She'll still see it.

323
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:08,122
- You're not stopping her-
- How does sitting next to a person...

324
00:17:08,289 --> 00:17:10,200
...in a movie theatre
increase the enjoyment?

325
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:12,360
You can't talk during a movie.

326
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:15,837
This is stupid. Come on.

327
00:17:16,009 --> 00:17:17,408
- Let's just go.
- Good.

328
00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:20,528
- Saving movies.
- Ridiculous.

329
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:23,157
Two for Prognosis Negative.

330
00:17:25,409 --> 00:17:28,321
- I'm in big trouble.
- Oh, you're dead.

331
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:33,125
Bell's Palsy.

332
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:37,168
The entire side of-
Of my face...

333
00:17:37,329 --> 00:17:39,559
...was paralysed.

334
00:17:39,729 --> 00:17:41,321
Farfel.

335
00:17:42,369 --> 00:17:45,247
You know, I couldn't- I couldn't-
I couldn't even feed myself.

336
00:17:45,409 --> 00:17:47,684
I was completely incapacitated.

337
00:17:48,209 --> 00:17:49,767
Quiet, Farfel!

338
00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:51,157
- Farfel.
- It's interesting...

339
00:17:51,329 --> 00:17:52,842
...because I called the hospital...

340
00:17:53,009 --> 00:17:54,920
...and they said you were
released on Monday.

341
00:17:55,329 --> 00:17:57,718
Yes, that's true...

342
00:17:57,889 --> 00:18:03,202
...but then, see, I was taken
to the Bell's Palsy Centre.

343
00:18:03,889 --> 00:18:05,880
In- In Rockville.

344
00:18:06,049 --> 00:18:08,643
Absolutely first-
First-rate facility.

345
00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:11,482
Top- Top-notch physicians.

346
00:18:11,929 --> 00:18:14,363
Hey, come on. Come on.
Get off me.

347
00:18:14,529 --> 00:18:16,838
He won't hurt you. He's just playing.

348
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:18,608
Now you keep that mutt
away from me.

349
00:18:18,769 --> 00:18:22,125
Mutt? I'll wager his parents
are more pure than yours.

350
00:18:23,409 --> 00:18:25,001
Kramer, are you coming?

351
00:18:25,169 --> 00:18:27,842
- Oh, hi, Ellen.
- Get in here.

352
00:18:32,049 --> 00:18:34,882
Listen, it's been a pleasure
taking care of your dog for a week...

353
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:36,926
...but if you don't mind...

354
00:18:37,089 --> 00:18:41,002
Prediction: You'll be calling me to ask
if you can come and visit him...

355
00:18:41,169 --> 00:18:42,887
...before the month is out.

356
00:18:43,529 --> 00:18:47,363
Prediction: I never see you
or him again for the rest of my life.

357
00:18:53,009 --> 00:18:54,601
We made plans.

358
00:18:55,049 --> 00:18:56,846
Why don't we just rent a movie?

359
00:18:57,009 --> 00:18:59,682
I thought you wanted to see
Prognosis Negative.

360
00:18:59,849 --> 00:19:04,798
No. It's supposed to be
really bad. Really bad.

361
00:19:04,969 --> 00:19:07,688
I mean, it's long. There's no story.

362
00:19:07,849 --> 00:19:12,206
It's so unbelievably boring-
I heard. I...

363
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,525
Jerry, you promised me we'd go.

364
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:18,761
Well, George told me
the whole story, line for line.

365
00:19:18,929 --> 00:19:22,365
I almost feel like I've seen it already
and walked out on it.

366
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:26,647
Wait. George saw the movie? I saw
him yesterday. He didn't mention it.

367
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:28,961
You and George got together?

368
00:19:29,129 --> 00:19:32,519
Yeah. I wanted to talk about how
we had nothing to talk about.

369
00:19:34,369 --> 00:19:35,563
Hello.

370
00:19:35,729 --> 00:19:37,003
Hi, hi, hi.

371
00:19:37,169 --> 00:19:38,397
What's up?

372
00:19:38,569 --> 00:19:40,048
Well, you were right.

373
00:19:40,209 --> 00:19:42,120
- About what?
- Ellen.

374
00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:44,849
We broke up again.

375
00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:47,482
Too bad.

376
00:19:47,649 --> 00:19:50,288
I thought she was the one.

377
00:19:51,609 --> 00:19:53,645
I'll bring back the pot.

378
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:56,207
Okay, come on. It's movie time.

379
00:19:56,369 --> 00:19:58,439
- Hey, what are you gonna see?
- Prognosis Negative.

380
00:19:58,609 --> 00:20:00,327
- That's supposed to be great.
- It's not.

381
00:20:00,489 --> 00:20:03,401
- Well, how do you know?
- I have an instinct for these things.

382
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:07,039
I had a parakeet when I was a kid.
That was the only pet I really enjoyed.

383
00:20:07,369 --> 00:20:08,961
We used to let him out of his cage...

384
00:20:09,129 --> 00:20:11,563
...and he would fly around.
And my mother had built-

385
00:20:11,729 --> 00:20:14,926
One entire wall of our living room
was mirrored...

386
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:17,125
...she felt this gives you
a feeling of space.

387
00:20:17,289 --> 00:20:19,439
Have you ever heard this
interior-design principle?

388
00:20:19,609 --> 00:20:21,839
The mirror makes it seem like
you have another room.

389
00:20:22,009 --> 00:20:23,408
Who walks up
to a mirror and goes:

390
00:20:23,569 --> 00:20:26,527
"Hey, look. There's a whole
other room in there.

391
00:20:27,249 --> 00:20:29,968
There's a guy in there,
looks just like me"?

392
00:20:32,049 --> 00:20:35,086
But the parakeet will fall for this.
You let him out. He flies around.

393
00:20:35,249 --> 00:20:38,605
Bang! With his little head.
He would just go:

394
00:20:38,769 --> 00:20:42,079
I'd always think, even if he thinks
the mirror is another room...

395
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:46,647
...why doesn't he at least try and
avoid hitting the other parakeet?

396
00:21:30,929 --> 00:21:32,920
