1
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:04,085
The transplant, the hair plug...

2
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:08,760
...is really quite amazing.
Hair on your shower soap yesterday...

3
00:00:08,929 --> 00:00:10,920
...can be in your head tomorrow.

4
00:00:11,089 --> 00:00:12,408
How do they do the transplant?

5
00:00:12,569 --> 00:00:14,764
Did they have the guy take
a shower, get his soap...

6
00:00:14,929 --> 00:00:16,282
...rush it in by helicopter?

7
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:19,486
You know, keep the soap alive
on the soap-support system?

8
00:00:20,209 --> 00:00:21,847
Then eventually move it over?

9
00:00:22,009 --> 00:00:25,001
"We got the hairs,
but I think we lost the Zest."

10
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:27,838
Sometimes the body
rejects the transplant...

11
00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:30,887
...with organs. Is it possible
that a head could reject...

12
00:00:31,049 --> 00:00:32,448
...a hair transplant?

13
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:35,567
The guy's just standing
around. Suddenly:

14
00:00:38,289 --> 00:00:40,678
It lands in someone's
frozen yoghurt.

15
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:47,358
You see, the gaskets
that you have here...

16
00:00:47,529 --> 00:00:49,167
...are asymmetrical.

17
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:52,048
- Really?
- So I took off the motor relay...

18
00:00:52,209 --> 00:00:56,361
...on the compressor because
you've got some discoloration.

19
00:00:56,529 --> 00:00:58,759
- Oh, whatever you have to do.
- I was working...

20
00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:00,521
...with one mount at a time.

21
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:02,725
You know, because
you don't want to disturb...

22
00:01:02,889 --> 00:01:06,279
- ... the position of the compressor.
- No, you don't.

23
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:10,803
Hey, what are you listening to?

24
00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:12,163
My show from last night.

25
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:14,968
- Oh, you taped it?
- Yeah, I was doing some new material.

26
00:01:15,129 --> 00:01:17,324
Did you ever do that thing
on the toes that I said?

27
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:21,645
You know, how, like, the big toe
is, like, the captain of the toes.

28
00:01:21,809 --> 00:01:24,528
But sometimes the toe
next to the big toe gets so big...

29
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:26,441
...that there's, like,
a power struggle.

30
00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:28,679
And the second toe assumes
control of the foot.

31
00:01:28,849 --> 00:01:30,919
- The coup d'é-toe.
- Yeah.

32
00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:33,288
- Did you do it?
- Yeah.

33
00:01:33,449 --> 00:01:34,928
- So?
- Nothing.

34
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,208
Nothing at all.

35
00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:38,882
- I need the phone.
- Who you calling?

36
00:01:39,049 --> 00:01:40,448
China.

37
00:01:41,329 --> 00:01:42,728
- China?
- Yeah, I'll pay for it.

38
00:01:42,889 --> 00:01:44,447
- What for?
- What for?

39
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:46,998
I'll tell you what for.
For hair.

40
00:01:47,769 --> 00:01:50,124
- Hair?
- The Chinese have done it, my friend.

41
00:01:50,649 --> 00:01:52,844
- The Chinese have done it.
- Done what?

42
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:55,807
- Discovered the cure for baldness.
- Did you see that last night?

43
00:01:55,969 --> 00:01:58,961
It was on CNN. This
Chinese doctor, Zang Zhao...

44
00:01:59,129 --> 00:02:00,482
...has cured baldness.

45
00:02:00,649 --> 00:02:02,924
- What's this?
- Oh, I just got it.

46
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:04,681
Spector gave it to me.

47
00:02:04,849 --> 00:02:06,601
He's giving everything away.

48
00:02:06,769 --> 00:02:09,203
He's becoming a minimalist.

49
00:02:10,089 --> 00:02:11,568
Is that the guy
who likes fat women?

50
00:02:11,729 --> 00:02:13,082
Yeah.

51
00:02:13,249 --> 00:02:16,798
Doesn't the fat fetish conflict
with the minimalism?

52
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:22,204
You. You should have watched
that report on CNN last night.

53
00:02:22,369 --> 00:02:24,519
I did. I'm trying to call China.

54
00:02:24,689 --> 00:02:26,361
You can't call China now.

55
00:02:26,529 --> 00:02:28,838
It's like, what, 3:00
in the morning there.

56
00:02:29,009 --> 00:02:31,079
- Oh, my God.
- What?

57
00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:34,358
Oh, God.

58
00:02:35,529 --> 00:02:36,962
Man.

59
00:02:38,089 --> 00:02:40,080
Oh, brother.

60
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:43,245
I can't believe
what I'm hearing.

61
00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:45,479
This woman's talking to me
on my tape recorder...

62
00:02:45,649 --> 00:02:46,798
...while I was on stage.

63
00:02:47,409 --> 00:02:48,967
This is wild.

64
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:51,085
I never heard
anything like this. Listen.

65
00:02:51,249 --> 00:02:54,286
I want to slide my tongue
around you lik e a s-

66
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:58,042
Oh, my God.

67
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:00,165
- Let me hear.
- Wait, wait, wait.

68
00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:03,719
- Who is this woman?
- I don't know. I have no idea.

69
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:05,607
I was just listening,
and she came on.

70
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:08,078
This is like a Penthouse letter.

71
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:10,886
- Why can't I meet women like this?
- Come on.

72
00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:12,880
Wait! Wait!

73
00:03:14,289 --> 00:03:17,008
- Where was the tape recorder?
- Back of the room, on the ledge.

74
00:03:17,169 --> 00:03:19,205
She must have been sitting
right in front of it.

75
00:03:19,369 --> 00:03:21,007
- My God.
- All right, come on.

76
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:23,399
- It's my turn.
- All right. All right. All right.

77
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:26,288
- How you gonna find out who this is?
- Good question.

78
00:03:26,449 --> 00:03:28,087
Where's the volume?

79
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:33,007
What do the Chinese
have to gain...

80
00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:35,478
...by faking a cure
for baldness?

81
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:38,117
If it was real, they'd never
let it out of the country.

82
00:03:38,289 --> 00:03:39,483
Imagine no baldness.

83
00:03:39,649 --> 00:03:41,685
It would be like
a nation of supermen.

84
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:43,528
- Hi, boys.
- Hello.

85
00:03:43,689 --> 00:03:45,805
- Hello.
- What's happening?

86
00:03:45,969 --> 00:03:48,119
Tell her.
I want to hear her reaction.

87
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:51,483
This woman left this sexy
message on Jerry's tape-

88
00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:53,128
Not that, you idiot!

89
00:03:53,289 --> 00:03:55,325
- What?
- The Chinese!

90
00:03:55,489 --> 00:03:57,002
The Chinese bald cure!

91
00:03:57,169 --> 00:03:59,637
- Oh, I thought you meant that-
- No, I meant the bald cure.

92
00:03:59,809 --> 00:04:01,640
We were talking
about the bald cure!

93
00:04:01,809 --> 00:04:02,958
What did she say?

94
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:05,168
Seinfeld.

95
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:07,362
Hey, is that Beder?

96
00:04:07,529 --> 00:04:09,167
I can't believe it.

97
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:11,240
Get me a cup of decaf.

98
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:13,680
So did you hear this message?

99
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:16,158
Man, it was unbelievable.

100
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:18,607
- Really?
- I can't get over it.

101
00:04:19,689 --> 00:04:21,122
Sexy?

102
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:23,723
This woman drove us
out of our minds.

103
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:25,959
Like, how did she sound?

104
00:04:26,129 --> 00:04:29,724
She had this throaty,
sexy kind of whisper.

105
00:04:30,129 --> 00:04:32,848
Really? Like...
Like:

106
00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:35,083
Jerry...

107
00:04:35,249 --> 00:04:38,844
...I want to slide my tongue
around you like a snake.

108
00:04:50,809 --> 00:04:53,164
Oh, my God.

109
00:04:53,809 --> 00:04:55,208
You?

110
00:04:55,369 --> 00:04:57,325
You?

111
00:04:58,049 --> 00:04:59,880
That was you!

112
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:02,119
- How did you-?
- I stopped in the club to see him.

113
00:05:02,289 --> 00:05:04,200
I was standing in the back
while he was on.

114
00:05:04,369 --> 00:05:06,599
There was this tape
recorder there.

115
00:05:06,769 --> 00:05:08,407
And I got this impulse.

116
00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:15,845
- What?
- No, nothing. Nothing.

117
00:05:17,369 --> 00:05:19,246
Now listen, promise me
you won't tell him.

118
00:05:19,409 --> 00:05:21,001
I want to have
a little fun with this.

119
00:05:21,409 --> 00:05:24,446
I had no idea you
were filled with such...

120
00:05:25,009 --> 00:05:27,079
...sexuality.

121
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:30,117
Oh, that was nothing.

122
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:31,881
So listen,
what about this bald thing?

123
00:05:32,049 --> 00:05:35,246
Some bald thing, a bald thing.
I don't know. It's nothing.

124
00:05:36,209 --> 00:05:37,642
- Remember Beder?
- Beder?

125
00:05:37,809 --> 00:05:39,128
Yeah, you remember Beder.

126
00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:41,359
I told you he went
to the track that one time...

127
00:05:41,529 --> 00:05:43,087
...and he was yelling
at this jockey.

128
00:05:43,249 --> 00:05:46,480
And the jockey got off the horse
and started chasing him.

129
00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:50,366
So listen. What about this girl
on your tape recorder?

130
00:05:50,529 --> 00:05:52,326
Oh, Elaine.

131
00:05:53,969 --> 00:05:58,281
What do you think an enraptured
female fan of mine might say?

132
00:05:58,689 --> 00:06:00,247
I don't know.

133
00:06:00,409 --> 00:06:03,719
She went on in some detail
about certain activities...

134
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:06,801
...illegal in some states,
for consenting adults.

135
00:06:06,969 --> 00:06:09,005
Things you would
know very little about.

136
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:11,239
- Oh, really?
- Well...

137
00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:13,559
...this type of thing
is very common...

138
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:15,879
...when you're in show business.

139
00:06:16,849 --> 00:06:18,282
So, what?
You gonna ask her out?

140
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:20,201
No, she didn't leave
her name or number.

141
00:06:20,369 --> 00:06:22,325
Bummer. Okay.

142
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:24,526
Good luck finding her.
I'm taking off.

143
00:06:24,849 --> 00:06:26,919
- Where are you going?
- Home.

144
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:28,523
What are you going home for?

145
00:06:30,129 --> 00:06:31,244
I just came from the gym-

146
00:06:31,409 --> 00:06:33,843
- Unless I can shower at your place.
- Sure.

147
00:06:40,089 --> 00:06:41,408
Oh, my God.

148
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:45,641
Oh, man.

149
00:06:45,809 --> 00:06:47,003
I don't get it.

150
00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:50,286
Why would a woman do that and then
leave no way to get in touch with her?

151
00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:52,246
Maybe she realized
she couldn't have you...

152
00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:55,082
...and jumped off the
George Washington Bridge.

153
00:06:55,769 --> 00:06:57,202
Yes. Operator.

154
00:06:57,369 --> 00:06:58,927
Beijing.

155
00:07:00,369 --> 00:07:03,247
- Why are you doing this?
- Why do I do anything?

156
00:07:03,409 --> 00:07:04,808
For women.

157
00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:06,925
Elaine, have you ever
gone out with a bald man?

158
00:07:07,089 --> 00:07:09,284
- No.
- Know what that makes you? A baldist.

159
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:12,121
Oh, this I need.

160
00:07:12,289 --> 00:07:15,804
Hello, is this
the hair restoration clinic?

161
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:18,119
Yeah, yeah.
Does anyone speak English?

162
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:20,041
You're taping.

163
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:22,279
Just be yourselves.

164
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:24,679
Oh, okay.

165
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:27,886
Well, we're talking
with Elaine Benes...

166
00:07:28,049 --> 00:07:29,801
...adult film star...

167
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:32,928
...on the set
of her new picture...

168
00:07:33,089 --> 00:07:35,398
...Elaine Does
the Upper West Side.

169
00:07:37,489 --> 00:07:39,798
Hi, how you doing?

170
00:07:39,969 --> 00:07:42,358
Well, I'm doing fine.

171
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:44,997
Do you speak English?
English!

172
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:47,160
Oh, here's the director,
Jerry Seinfeld.

173
00:07:47,329 --> 00:07:49,320
Jerry, you discovered
Elaine Benes.

174
00:07:49,489 --> 00:07:51,002
Well, yes I did. That's true.

175
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:54,445
Couple of guys I knew
in the Coast Guard told me about her.

176
00:07:56,209 --> 00:08:00,043
And I sensed that she had
the anger and intensity...

177
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:03,042
...that I needed
to make this film work.

178
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,002
English!

179
00:08:05,729 --> 00:08:07,003
Does anybody speak English?

180
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:08,363
Nobody speaks English.

181
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:11,248
So, what scene are you getting
ready to shoot now, Elaine?

182
00:08:11,409 --> 00:08:14,560
In this scene, my co-star,
who's right over here...

183
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:17,482
Follow me.
Is George Costanza.

184
00:08:17,649 --> 00:08:19,719
And he plays an airline pilot...

185
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:21,322
...who's just returned
from Rome.

186
00:08:21,489 --> 00:08:24,845
And I'm about to show him
how much I've missed him.

187
00:08:25,849 --> 00:08:27,726
That's my Chinese food.

188
00:08:29,369 --> 00:08:31,724
So, George, is this your
first movie with Elaine?

189
00:08:33,009 --> 00:08:34,488
I don't know.

190
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:40,442
So, Elaine, in your movies,
is the sex real, or is it simulated?

191
00:08:40,609 --> 00:08:42,759
Oh, it's always simulated...

192
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:44,408
...except with George.

193
00:08:44,569 --> 00:08:46,446
That's in my contract.

194
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,042
Al right, Kramer.
That's enough.

195
00:08:48,209 --> 00:08:50,279
That's enough. Yeah, hello?

196
00:08:50,449 --> 00:08:51,643
Yeah, hello?

197
00:08:51,809 --> 00:08:53,083
English!

198
00:08:53,249 --> 00:08:54,762
Does anyone speak English?

199
00:08:54,929 --> 00:08:56,442
- How much do I owe you?
- $15.90

200
00:08:56,609 --> 00:08:58,884
- $15.90?
- Excuse me?

201
00:08:59,049 --> 00:09:01,324
- Do you speak Chinese?
- Chinese? Yeah.

202
00:09:01,489 --> 00:09:02,888
Oh, look!

203
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:06,121
I'm on with Beijing
at the hair restoration clinic.

204
00:09:06,289 --> 00:09:07,722
Could you talk to them for me...

205
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:10,119
...and tell them
I'd like to place an order?

206
00:09:20,689 --> 00:09:23,249
They've got a billion people over
there. He found a relative.

207
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:27,560
If you send money,
they send cream.

208
00:09:27,729 --> 00:09:29,003
They send me. All right.

209
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:30,682
Ask them, does it really work?

210
00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:36,842
They say you grow hair.
Look like Stalin.

211
00:09:39,569 --> 00:09:41,958
Ask them,
are there any side effects?

212
00:09:44,729 --> 00:09:46,606
Impotence.

213
00:09:48,849 --> 00:09:52,205
Oh, funny.
He's a funny guy, yeah.

214
00:09:52,369 --> 00:09:54,360
Get a money order
from the Bank of China.

215
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:56,326
Be here three days
after they get check.

216
00:09:56,489 --> 00:09:57,922
All right, thank you. Thank you.

217
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:19,128
Excuse me.

218
00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:21,318
Kind of an expensive call.

219
00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:25,128
Thanks for driving me home.

220
00:10:25,289 --> 00:10:26,642
What did I do to deserve this?

221
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:28,288
You do plenty.

222
00:10:29,369 --> 00:10:32,645
So, what are you doing?
You're- You're going in.

223
00:10:32,809 --> 00:10:34,640
Well, yeah. I guess so.

224
00:10:34,809 --> 00:10:36,527
Why, you want to do something?

225
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:40,639
Yeah, I don't-
I don't know. What?

226
00:10:43,129 --> 00:10:44,357
There's really nothing to do.

227
00:10:44,529 --> 00:10:47,043
Yeah, no. There's-
There's nothing.

228
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:49,006
Can you think of anything?

229
00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:52,201
No, no. Not really.

230
00:10:52,809 --> 00:10:54,686
I am up for anything.

231
00:10:54,849 --> 00:10:56,680
Really?

232
00:11:00,049 --> 00:11:01,960
I have to say...

233
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:04,848
...you were really good
doing that porno thing.

234
00:11:05,009 --> 00:11:06,761
You're- You're talented.

235
00:11:06,929 --> 00:11:08,647
I was just kidding around.

236
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:12,209
That thing you said about
the sex not being simulated...

237
00:11:14,449 --> 00:11:15,723
That was really funny.

238
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:19,484
Yeah, that was fun.

239
00:11:22,409 --> 00:11:24,764
So I'll speak to you
through Jerry and everything.

240
00:11:24,929 --> 00:11:26,567
Okay.

241
00:11:26,729 --> 00:11:28,924
- Thanks a lot for the ride.
- Yeah, anytime.

242
00:11:38,289 --> 00:11:39,802
Thanks a million. I appreciate this.

243
00:11:39,969 --> 00:11:41,880
You're sure this was
the woman at the table...

244
00:11:42,049 --> 00:11:44,199
...where I had
my tape recorder?

245
00:11:44,369 --> 00:11:46,041
Okay, great.

246
00:11:46,209 --> 00:11:48,040
Thanks, again. Bye.

247
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:53,604
Who do these women
think they're dealing with?

248
00:11:55,449 --> 00:11:58,282
Did she think she was gonna leave
this incredibly erotic message...

249
00:11:58,449 --> 00:12:00,485
...on my tape,
and I was just gonna let it go?

250
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:03,727
Not bloody likely.

251
00:12:04,969 --> 00:12:06,118
What is that?

252
00:12:06,289 --> 00:12:08,359
- It's my cockney accent.
- No, no. That's no good.

253
00:12:09,489 --> 00:12:10,763
Let's hear yours.

254
00:12:10,929 --> 00:12:13,159
Not bloody likely.

255
00:12:16,449 --> 00:12:19,043
That's the worst cockney accent
I ever heard in my life.

256
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,559
Hey, Georgie boy,
guess what I got.

257
00:12:22,729 --> 00:12:24,447
Guess what I got.

258
00:12:24,609 --> 00:12:25,803
Oh, is that the bald stuff?

259
00:12:25,969 --> 00:12:27,561
From China.
All the way from China.

260
00:12:27,729 --> 00:12:29,162
Wait, wait.
Let me get the camera.

261
00:12:29,329 --> 00:12:33,083
No, don't get the camera.
We don't need the camera.

262
00:12:33,249 --> 00:12:35,638
I know you're sceptical,
but I believe in the Chinese.

263
00:12:35,809 --> 00:12:37,003
Yes, I am sceptical.

264
00:12:37,649 --> 00:12:40,038
Why do you have to be
so suspicious of everyone?

265
00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:42,245
This is a great man,
Zang Zhao.

266
00:12:42,409 --> 00:12:44,127
He wants to help bald people.

267
00:12:44,289 --> 00:12:46,928
Wait, wait. Let's videotape
your head for the before picture.

268
00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:48,761
So we can watch
how it grows and stuff.

269
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:50,965
- Here, sit down.
- All right.

270
00:12:56,049 --> 00:12:58,085
All right, lean back.

271
00:12:59,969 --> 00:13:01,721
A little bit to the right.

272
00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:03,880
Now make sure
you get this area here.

273
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:05,767
- That's where he needs help.
- All right.

274
00:13:07,849 --> 00:13:09,965
Well, he's a happy
camper, huh?

275
00:13:10,129 --> 00:13:13,326
Happy camper. Yeah,
I don't hear that expression enough.

276
00:13:13,849 --> 00:13:15,407
Remember that guy
who took my jacket?

277
00:13:15,569 --> 00:13:17,082
The one I found
at my mother's house?

278
00:13:17,449 --> 00:13:18,598
- Yeah.
- My mother told me...

279
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:20,407
...that he got arrested
for mail fraud.

280
00:13:20,569 --> 00:13:22,287
- No kidding.
- Yeah, he's in jail.

281
00:13:22,449 --> 00:13:24,326
What about the jacket?
He take it with him?

282
00:13:24,489 --> 00:13:26,764
That's what I intend
to find out.

283
00:13:30,049 --> 00:13:31,960
Well, you can see it.

284
00:13:32,129 --> 00:13:34,120
Are you gonna
walk around like that?

285
00:13:34,569 --> 00:13:35,797
And it stinks.

286
00:13:35,969 --> 00:13:37,368
Can you smell that?

287
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:39,326
You stink.

288
00:13:41,449 --> 00:13:43,405
How long are you supposed
to leave it on for?

289
00:13:43,569 --> 00:13:45,127
All day.

290
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:50,804
- Hello?
- Helo, it's Elaine Marie Benes.

291
00:13:50,969 --> 00:13:52,448
- Well, hello.
- Helo.

292
00:13:52,609 --> 00:13:54,122
Did you find out
who that woman was?

293
00:13:54,289 --> 00:13:56,120
Yes, I got her number.

294
00:13:56,289 --> 00:13:58,245
- Hey, is that Elaine?
- Yeah.

295
00:13:58,409 --> 00:14:00,081
Hi, Elaine!

296
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:03,726
So I guess you figure
you're in for a pretty wild night.

297
00:14:03,889 --> 00:14:05,083
Well, as I said...

298
00:14:05,249 --> 00:14:08,127
...this type of thing is
very common in show business.

299
00:14:08,769 --> 00:14:11,237
Wel, listen, I'm at Arlene's.
You want me to stop by?

300
00:14:11,409 --> 00:14:12,762
- Sure.
- Okay, bye.

301
00:14:12,929 --> 00:14:14,408
Bye.

302
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:16,845
- Did she say "hello"?
- What? Oh, I don't know.

303
00:14:17,729 --> 00:14:21,324
What do you mean? She heard me
say hello. Did she say hello back?

304
00:14:21,489 --> 00:14:23,480
I don't know.
Who keeps track of hellos?

305
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:26,846
Isn't it polite to say hello
when somebody says hello?

306
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:30,368
She's coming up.

307
00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:32,520
- Elaine's coming up?
- Yeah, why? What's wrong?

308
00:14:35,169 --> 00:14:37,763
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere, nowhere. I'll be right out.

309
00:14:38,569 --> 00:14:40,480
How often do you
cut your toenails?

310
00:14:43,929 --> 00:14:46,568
I would say every two and a half
to eight weeks.

311
00:14:48,689 --> 00:14:50,919
Because the other night
I was sleeping with Marion...

312
00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:53,967
...and I rolled over, and I
cut her ankle with my big toe.

313
00:14:55,409 --> 00:14:57,639
The big toe, the captain.

314
00:14:58,289 --> 00:15:00,644
- What?
- The captain of the toes.

315
00:15:05,329 --> 00:15:06,762
- Hello?
- Jerry?

316
00:15:06,929 --> 00:15:08,157
- Yeah.
- Jerry, listen.

317
00:15:08,329 --> 00:15:10,524
I got too much to do.
I can't come over. Forget it.

318
00:15:10,689 --> 00:15:11,883
Oh, okay, too bad.

319
00:15:12,049 --> 00:15:13,960
So when are you
gonna cal her?

320
00:15:14,129 --> 00:15:16,404
As soon as I get off
the phone with you.

321
00:15:16,569 --> 00:15:19,037
- Good luck.
- Okay.

322
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,927
- Bye.
- Bye.

323
00:15:21,649 --> 00:15:24,721
- What happened? You took it off?
- Yeah. That was enough.

324
00:15:25,609 --> 00:15:26,758
That's it? You gave up?

325
00:15:26,929 --> 00:15:28,760
No, I'm working on a system.
Who was that?

326
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:32,046
That was Elaine. She changed
her mind. She's not coming over.

327
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:41,527
- Helo?
- Hello, is this Alisha?

328
00:15:41,689 --> 00:15:44,283
- Yes.
- This is Jerry Seinfeld.

329
00:15:53,649 --> 00:15:55,241
- So?
- I don't get this woman.

330
00:15:55,409 --> 00:15:58,640
We're having a great time,
couple of laughs. Everything's nice.

331
00:15:58,809 --> 00:16:00,527
End of the night,
I go in for contact.

332
00:16:00,689 --> 00:16:02,281
I get the pullback.

333
00:16:02,689 --> 00:16:06,125
This woman, she said the filthiest
things I ever heard in my life.

334
00:16:06,849 --> 00:16:08,646
And I get the pullback.

335
00:16:11,089 --> 00:16:12,238
- Yeah?
- It's George.

336
00:16:12,409 --> 00:16:13,967
Come on up.

337
00:16:14,289 --> 00:16:15,722
What is he doing here now?

338
00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:17,800
So you blew it?

339
00:16:19,249 --> 00:16:20,921
She must be psychotic
or something.

340
00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:23,205
Let me have the number.

341
00:16:23,369 --> 00:16:24,848
I'm not giving you the number.

342
00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:26,761
I know how to handle
these psychotics.

343
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:34,167
Sheriff.

344
00:16:36,849 --> 00:16:38,680
What's with the hat?

345
00:16:40,529 --> 00:16:42,281
Boy, you stink.

346
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,924
- What are you doing here now?
- I have to talk to you.

347
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:47,886
Let's take a look here,
see what we got.

348
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:52,201
Wait a second.

349
00:16:52,849 --> 00:16:55,204
I think I see
something here, George.

350
00:16:55,369 --> 00:16:59,408
- Let's go to the videotape.
- Oh, Kramer. No, no.

351
00:17:01,409 --> 00:17:02,922
- What's up?
- I can't tell you now.

352
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:04,841
- He'll be back in 10 seconds.
- Start it.

353
00:17:05,009 --> 00:17:06,158
- I can't.
- Oh, come on.

354
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:09,321
He'll be over there for a half-hour.
He gets lost over there.

355
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:11,685
- Come on. What is this about?
- All right.

356
00:17:14,129 --> 00:17:15,562
I've become attracted to Elaine.

357
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:18,808
All right.

358
00:17:20,769 --> 00:17:22,361
- Sit down.
- Could we do this later?

359
00:17:22,529 --> 00:17:24,440
No, I got the tape right here.

360
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:26,520
Kramer, let's do this later.

361
00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:28,042
Okay, now...

362
00:17:28,769 --> 00:17:31,124
This is the tape
that we made earlier.

363
00:17:32,169 --> 00:17:33,648
And I think...

364
00:17:33,809 --> 00:17:36,448
...that I see a couple of buds...

365
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:39,965
...right here.

366
00:17:40,129 --> 00:17:41,767
- Really? You think?
- Yeah.

367
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:44,568
Kramer, I would like to talk
to George for a minute, please.

368
00:17:44,729 --> 00:17:46,367
- About what?
- It's kind of private.

369
00:17:46,529 --> 00:17:48,167
Like the big toe captain? What?

370
00:17:48,329 --> 00:17:51,241
- Oh, so you're doing my bit?
- I'm not doing the bit!

371
00:17:51,729 --> 00:17:53,481
All right.
Okay, all right.

372
00:17:53,649 --> 00:17:56,038
I'm gonna take
a look at this, huh?

373
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:02,528
- Does she know?
- No.

374
00:18:02,689 --> 00:18:05,283
- How did it happen?
- I can't say.

375
00:18:05,449 --> 00:18:07,724
- Well, why can't you say?
- Because I promised her.

376
00:18:07,889 --> 00:18:10,119
- I thought you said she doesn't know.
- She doesn't.

377
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:12,598
- So how can you promise her?
- Because she asked me to.

378
00:18:12,769 --> 00:18:14,839
What is this,
an Abbott and Costello routine?

379
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:18,606
All right, you really want to know?

380
00:18:19,489 --> 00:18:22,128
It all started
when she told me...

381
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:24,764
...that she was the voice
on your tape recorder.

382
00:18:25,369 --> 00:18:26,438
What? Elaine?

383
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:29,965
Yeah. She made me promise not
to tell. It was supposed to be a joke.

384
00:18:30,129 --> 00:18:32,040
- That was Elaine?
- Yeah, let me hear.

385
00:18:32,209 --> 00:18:35,326
- Wait a second! Give me a second-
- You heard it 50 times already-

386
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,957
She's my ex-girlfriend.
I think I have precedence.

387
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:45,561
- Yeah?
- Hi, it's Elaine.

388
00:18:45,729 --> 00:18:47,765
Is this a bad time?

389
00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:49,277
Yeah.

390
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,881
Don't tell her I told you!
She'll kill me!

391
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:54,199
Okay, I promise!

392
00:19:01,369 --> 00:19:03,087
Oh, man.

393
00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:05,760
Oh, God.

394
00:19:06,369 --> 00:19:08,644
Oh, brother.

395
00:19:11,329 --> 00:19:15,481
- What's the matter?
- I got a pain in my side...

396
00:19:16,369 --> 00:19:17,961
- ... from, you know-
- Hi, George.

397
00:19:18,129 --> 00:19:19,847
Hi, how you doing?

398
00:19:21,049 --> 00:19:23,358
Something stinks in here.

399
00:19:28,129 --> 00:19:29,323
What are you doing here?

400
00:19:30,089 --> 00:19:33,001
I was the one who talked
into your tape recorder.

401
00:19:33,169 --> 00:19:34,887
I know. George told me.

402
00:19:39,089 --> 00:19:42,126
- You told him?
- He threatened me.

403
00:19:43,369 --> 00:19:45,758
Where did you come up
with all that stuff?

404
00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:48,159
- Oh, that was nothing.
- Elaine...

405
00:19:49,729 --> 00:19:51,526
- I have to tell you something.
- George, no.

406
00:19:51,689 --> 00:19:53,247
- No, no.
- George, I'm telling you-

407
00:19:53,409 --> 00:19:54,762
What is it?

408
00:19:54,929 --> 00:19:56,647
I'm very attracted to you.

409
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:58,523
I found a hair!

410
00:19:59,609 --> 00:20:00,803
Yes!

411
00:20:00,969 --> 00:20:03,324
Okay, come here. Come here.
Take a look at this.

412
00:20:03,489 --> 00:20:07,243
Ever since I found out that you left
the message on Jerry's tape recorder-

413
00:20:10,529 --> 00:20:13,202
- That was you?
- It was a joke.

414
00:20:13,569 --> 00:20:15,878
Wait.

415
00:20:16,369 --> 00:20:18,758
Oh, my God.

416
00:20:19,289 --> 00:20:21,120
Oh, yeah.

417
00:20:22,249 --> 00:20:25,161
Elaine, I can't believe
that that is you.

418
00:20:32,369 --> 00:20:33,882
I think I'll get going.

419
00:20:34,049 --> 00:20:35,721
Stick around a while.

420
00:20:35,889 --> 00:20:38,278
- It's early.
- We'll order Chinese.

421
00:20:42,369 --> 00:20:45,167
Give me the tape.
Give me the tape.

422
00:20:52,609 --> 00:20:54,725
A woman left a message
on my phone machine...

423
00:20:54,889 --> 00:20:56,527
...with kind of a breathy voice.

424
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:59,840
No matter what a woman says, if it's
in that breathy voice, you know...

425
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:00,998
"You have cancer."

426
00:21:01,169 --> 00:21:02,966
"Really?"

427
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:06,201
Sounds pretty good.

428
00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:10,238
The stewardess could lean over
and whisper in my ear:

429
00:21:10,409 --> 00:21:11,762
"Would you put
on your seat belt.

430
00:21:11,929 --> 00:21:14,921
We're about to go
into a mountain."

431
00:21:15,089 --> 00:21:17,080
I'd go, "Really, so
what are you doing later...

432
00:21:17,249 --> 00:21:20,082
...by the ruptured remains
of the fuselage?

433
00:21:20,249 --> 00:21:23,047
How about some peanuts
over by the black box?

434
00:21:23,729 --> 00:21:24,923
I'll meet you there."

435
00:21:30,449 --> 00:21:31,438
