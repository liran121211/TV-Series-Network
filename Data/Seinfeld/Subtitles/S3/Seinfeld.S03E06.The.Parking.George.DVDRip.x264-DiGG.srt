1
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:04,723
It's hard to find a store in a mall.
They have a directory...

2
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:09,519
...but the problem with it is,
even if you figure out where you are...

3
00:00:09,689 --> 00:00:11,247
...and where you wanna go...

4
00:00:11,409 --> 00:00:14,446
...you still don't really know,
sometimes, which way to walk...

5
00:00:14,609 --> 00:00:16,839
...because it's an upright map.

6
00:00:17,009 --> 00:00:20,524
If you had, like, suction-cup feet,
then you could just walk right up on it.

7
00:00:20,689 --> 00:00:24,398
Then you could tell, you could be
on it going, "All right, I'm here.

8
00:00:24,569 --> 00:00:26,366
I wanna go to the Gap.
That's down there.

9
00:00:26,529 --> 00:00:28,042
All right, I'll just walk that way."

10
00:00:31,569 --> 00:00:35,244
But people would know. They would
see you walking down the mall going:

11
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:38,444
They'd go, "That's one
of those suction-cup guys.

12
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:42,318
I heard about that guy.
He's never lost."

13
00:00:46,169 --> 00:00:47,488
One left. What a joke.

14
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:49,924
- You can have this one.
- That's not enough BTUs...

15
00:00:50,089 --> 00:00:52,523
...for my living room.
This was a waste of time.

16
00:00:52,689 --> 00:00:53,883
I didn't get one either.

17
00:00:54,049 --> 00:00:55,562
Why do I always have the feeling...

18
00:00:55,729 --> 00:00:58,243
...everybody's doing something
better than me on Saturdays?

19
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:00,127
- This is what people do.
- No, they don't.

20
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:02,928
They're out on some big picnic,
they're cooking burgers...

21
00:01:03,089 --> 00:01:05,000
...making out on blankets.

22
00:01:05,169 --> 00:01:06,761
They're not at some mall in Jersey...

23
00:01:06,929 --> 00:01:10,285
...watching their friends trying to find
the world's cheapest air conditioner.

24
00:01:10,449 --> 00:01:13,521
You should see what my father used
to do before he bought a new car.

25
00:01:13,689 --> 00:01:16,522
He'd go from state to state.
He was away for weeks at a time.

26
00:01:16,689 --> 00:01:19,408
Like he's running for president
and going through the primaries.

27
00:01:19,569 --> 00:01:21,287
We'd get phone calls
from New Hampshire.

28
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:23,526
We took a little ride,
what's the big deal?

29
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:25,805
At least you accomplished something.
You got fish.

30
00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:27,004
Oh, big accomplishment.

31
00:01:27,169 --> 00:01:29,125
Fish. What do they do?

32
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:31,803
- What do you do?
- Hey, this way!

33
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:35,561
Jerry, what time do you have?

34
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,321
I have 5:00.

35
00:01:37,489 --> 00:01:40,481
- Always late. Always late.
- You're not late.

36
00:01:40,649 --> 00:01:43,117
I told them to meet me
in front of my building at 6: 15.

37
00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:46,087
- Who?
- My parents. It's their anniversary.

38
00:01:46,249 --> 00:01:48,638
I'm taking them out to dinner
and a show tonight.

39
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:51,118
- Think we'll hit traffic?
- Of course. It's rush hour.

40
00:01:51,289 --> 00:01:53,280
- Isn't it the other way?
- There's no other way.

41
00:01:53,449 --> 00:01:55,041
Everybody goes every way
all the time.

42
00:01:55,209 --> 00:01:58,087
- But it's Saturday.
- You got the picnic and burger traffic.

43
00:01:58,249 --> 00:02:00,717
- There's picnic traffic?
- As my grandfather used to say:

44
00:02:00,889 --> 00:02:02,925
"Sometimes even a picnic's
no picnic."

45
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:07,844
I always get myself in this position.
Can't be on time. Gotta rush.

46
00:02:08,689 --> 00:02:10,361
What's the matter?

47
00:02:13,649 --> 00:02:15,002
I have to go to the bathroom.

48
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:17,399
Why do they hide the bathrooms
in these malls?

49
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:21,203
- You want me to help you with that?
- No, I got it.

50
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,367
What do you think, Georgie boy?

51
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,246
Did I need that pointed out for me?

52
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:34,401
What is that gonna do for me?
How does that help me, to see her?

53
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:36,958
I'm trying to live my life.
Don't show me that.

54
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:38,926
Well, if you like her, go and talk to her.

55
00:02:39,089 --> 00:02:41,478
Yeah, women love to get approached
in parking garages.

56
00:02:41,649 --> 00:02:45,164
I'll go up and say, "Hi, how you doing?
Would you like a glass of white wine?"

57
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:48,287
You get within 15 feet, she'd have
her finger on the Mace button.

58
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:50,724
That was a guy.

59
00:02:50,889 --> 00:02:53,244
- That was a guy?
- Where's the car?

60
00:02:53,409 --> 00:02:55,081
Well, I thought it was here.

61
00:02:55,249 --> 00:02:57,444
You don't know where we parked?

62
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:02,079
- Oh, this is great.
- Look, I thought it was Green 22.

63
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:04,319
I remember Orange.
I thought it was Orange.

64
00:03:05,009 --> 00:03:07,364
- I didn't pay attention.
- This is just what I need.

65
00:03:07,529 --> 00:03:08,962
I'm sure it's right around here.

66
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:11,199
Yeah, it looks familiar.
I remember the elevator.

67
00:03:11,369 --> 00:03:15,203
There's elevators all over!
Everything looks the same!

68
00:03:15,369 --> 00:03:18,122
We're like rats in some experiment.

69
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:21,168
It's over there. I know where it is.

70
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:24,529
- It's black, right?
- Well, it's dark brown.

71
00:03:24,689 --> 00:03:26,998
In a parking lot, you write it down.
How hard is that?

72
00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:28,522
There it is.

73
00:03:28,689 --> 00:03:30,088
No, no.

74
00:03:30,249 --> 00:03:32,126
That's a Toyota.

75
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:37,002
- I thought it was...
- Hey, didn't we come in over there?

76
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:41,204
I thought we came in over there.

77
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:44,767
How long can fish live
in one of these plastic bags?

78
00:03:44,929 --> 00:03:47,159
I don't know. Maybe two hours.

79
00:03:48,009 --> 00:03:49,647
You better find this car.

80
00:03:49,809 --> 00:03:51,322
Let's try this way.

81
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:54,447
I really have to go to the bathroom.

82
00:03:55,089 --> 00:03:57,887
Why don't you just go
behind one of these cars.

83
00:03:58,449 --> 00:04:01,600
- Why? There's nobody around.
- I'll wait.

84
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:05,159
You hold it in like that, you can cause
a lot of damage to your bladder.

85
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:07,047
That's what happens to truck drivers.

86
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:09,120
They hold it in all the time
and eventually...

87
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:12,087
- ... it starts to come out involuntarily.
- All right.

88
00:04:12,529 --> 00:04:17,319
Jerry, are you aware that adult diapers
are a $600-million-a-year industry?

89
00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:20,686
Maybe I should just go any time I get
the urge, like you, wherever I am.

90
00:04:20,849 --> 00:04:24,046
There's too much urinary freedom
in this society. I'm proud to hold it in.

91
00:04:24,209 --> 00:04:25,358
It builds character.

92
00:04:25,529 --> 00:04:27,406
- Is that it?
- No.

93
00:04:28,209 --> 00:04:30,086
Hey! Watch it!

94
00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:32,122
Maniac.

95
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:36,681
You sure you don't want help
with that?

96
00:04:36,849 --> 00:04:39,204
I'm gonna put it down
behind that car.

97
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:42,197
Worried somebody's gonna pee on it?

98
00:04:47,409 --> 00:04:50,879
- It's Purple 23. Remember that.
- Oh, I got it.

99
00:04:51,049 --> 00:04:54,837
That I'm supposed to remember.
Where the car is, that's insignificant.

100
00:04:55,249 --> 00:04:57,240
I think they're labouring.

101
00:04:57,409 --> 00:05:00,321
Look at this place! It's huge!

102
00:05:03,249 --> 00:05:05,319
All right, let me say this to you:

103
00:05:05,489 --> 00:05:09,801
If I am not in front of my building
at 6: 15, when my parents get there...

104
00:05:09,969 --> 00:05:12,529
...they're gonna put me on
an aggravation instalment plan...

105
00:05:12,689 --> 00:05:14,805
...that will compound, with interest,
for decades.

106
00:05:14,969 --> 00:05:16,482
Parents never forget a foul-up.

107
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,163
I once left my jacket on a bus
when I was 14.

108
00:05:19,329 --> 00:05:22,241
I was flying to Chicago,
last week, on a plane:

109
00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:24,081
"Make sure you hang on
to your jacket."

110
00:05:24,249 --> 00:05:25,648
There's no way you can call them?

111
00:05:25,809 --> 00:05:28,607
- Yeah, I'll call them on their car phone.
- What would it take...

112
00:05:28,769 --> 00:05:31,647
- ... for his parents to get a car phone?
- Hypnosis by aliens.

113
00:05:31,809 --> 00:05:34,642
- Where the hell is this car, Kramer?
- We need a system.

114
00:05:34,809 --> 00:05:36,037
Well, it's gotta be here.

115
00:05:36,209 --> 00:05:38,439
Why are they using so many colours?

116
00:05:38,609 --> 00:05:41,248
The numbers go up to 40.

117
00:05:41,489 --> 00:05:43,923
Maybe it's not on this level.

118
00:05:45,689 --> 00:05:47,759
- What?
- There's four different levels.

119
00:05:47,929 --> 00:05:49,681
Maybe we're on the wrong level.

120
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,841
- How long was the escalator ride up?
- It felt like a couple of levels.

121
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:55,045
You should always bring
a pad and a pen.

122
00:05:55,209 --> 00:05:57,803
I can't carry a pen.
I'm afraid I'll puncture my scrotum.

123
00:05:57,969 --> 00:05:59,288
I got a pen.

124
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:01,599
Where is the bathroom in this mall?

125
00:06:01,769 --> 00:06:04,203
There's 600 stores,
I didn't see one bathroom.

126
00:06:04,369 --> 00:06:05,768
What is this, like, a joke?

127
00:06:05,929 --> 00:06:09,604
Don't they consult with a urologist
when they build one of these places?

128
00:06:12,409 --> 00:06:14,445
- What's with you?
- My ear itches.

129
00:06:14,609 --> 00:06:17,248
Don't you dare talk to me like that,
you hear me?

130
00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:21,163
I told you, I don't care!
You'll have to wait!

131
00:06:21,329 --> 00:06:23,797
Hey, hey, is that really necessary?

132
00:06:23,969 --> 00:06:25,880
Why don't you mind
your own business.

133
00:06:26,049 --> 00:06:29,280
Well, I think hitting a defenceless child
is my business.

134
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:31,440
- You're ugly.
- What?

135
00:06:31,609 --> 00:06:33,406
- You're ugly.
- You are.

136
00:06:33,569 --> 00:06:35,560
- You are.
- That's what you think.

137
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,924
That's what I know.

138
00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:45,479
- I found it!
- He's got it!

139
00:06:47,329 --> 00:06:50,207
- No, no, no.
- All right, that's it.

140
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:53,998
From now on, no more calling out
"I found it"unless we're sitting in it.

141
00:06:54,169 --> 00:06:56,160
Jerry, look at my fish.

142
00:06:56,329 --> 00:06:58,718
- His eyes look a little cloudy.
- See?

143
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:00,845
Oh, those are your eyes.

144
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,801
Oh, they are gonna be furious.

145
00:07:02,969 --> 00:07:04,641
- Who's got the tickets?
- I do.

146
00:07:04,809 --> 00:07:06,037
I thought you knew this mall.

147
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:08,359
- You said you'd been here.
- It was easy last time.

148
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:10,759
Okay, my fish are dying
right in front of me.

149
00:07:10,929 --> 00:07:14,001
We've gotta get someone to drive us
around to us help look for the car.

150
00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:16,603
No one's gonna do that.

151
00:07:17,489 --> 00:07:18,888
Excuse me. Hi.

152
00:07:19,049 --> 00:07:23,247
We can't seem to find our car. I was
wondering if it would be possible...

153
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:26,924
...to drive us around the garage
for five minutes so we can look.

154
00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:28,727
Sorry.

155
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:31,562
- Just five minutes.
- Can't do it.

156
00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:34,598
We're not skinheads.

157
00:07:38,489 --> 00:07:41,640
Excuse me.
I can't seem to find my car.

158
00:07:41,809 --> 00:07:44,243
Do you think you could drive me-?

159
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:49,688
Oh, that's funny? Is that funny?
Hey, tell me if you think this is funny:

160
00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:52,841
These fish are dying.

161
00:07:53,609 --> 00:07:55,839
In an hour they'll be belly-up!

162
00:07:57,089 --> 00:07:59,080
Excuse me.

163
00:07:59,329 --> 00:08:01,285
Excuse me.

164
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:05,005
Hey, sorry to have disturbed you.
Terribly sorry.

165
00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:08,286
But the fish will be dead!
You do know that?

166
00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:10,758
They can't live in plastic.

167
00:08:10,929 --> 00:08:14,205
That's not me talking, that's science!

168
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:17,167
It's amazing how shopping
makes me have to go.

169
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:20,048
How does my bladder know
I'm in a department store?

170
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:22,279
Why don't you just go.

171
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:24,007
No, I can't.

172
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:27,081
- Don't you get tired of following rules?
- You think I'm too cautious?

173
00:08:27,249 --> 00:08:30,207
Why be uncomfortable
if you don't have to?

174
00:08:30,369 --> 00:08:33,281
- It's organic.
- Organic. So is Buddy Hackett.

175
00:08:33,449 --> 00:08:35,679
- Buddy Hackett?
- He's a comedian.

176
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:37,083
I know.

177
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:41,005
- All right, all right.
- Hey, you can go over here.

178
00:08:42,569 --> 00:08:44,605
I can manage.

179
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:48,446
George!

180
00:08:57,769 --> 00:08:58,963
- Okay, let's go.
- But-

181
00:08:59,129 --> 00:09:00,482
Come on.

182
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:02,765
Kramer.

183
00:09:07,289 --> 00:09:10,326
I'm telling you, I've had this condition
since I was 11 years old.

184
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:12,765
I've been in and out of hospitals
my whole life.

185
00:09:12,929 --> 00:09:14,840
I have no control over it.

186
00:09:15,009 --> 00:09:17,398
Doctors have told me
that when I feel it...

187
00:09:17,569 --> 00:09:19,525
...the best thing to do
is just release it.

188
00:09:19,689 --> 00:09:21,281
Otherwise...

189
00:09:21,449 --> 00:09:22,802
...I could die.

190
00:09:23,489 --> 00:09:24,968
Do you hear what
I'm saying to you?

191
00:09:25,129 --> 00:09:28,758
I'm telling you
that if I don't go, I could die.

192
00:09:28,929 --> 00:09:31,489
Die! Is it worth dying for?

193
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:35,039
- That's up to you.
- Oh, so you don't care if I die.

194
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:38,679
What I care about is the sanitary
condition of the parking facility.

195
00:09:38,849 --> 00:09:40,885
Why would I do it
unless I was in mortal danger?

196
00:09:41,049 --> 00:09:43,085
- I know it's against the law.
- I don't know.

197
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:47,003
Because I could get "uromysitisis"
poisoning and die, that's why.

198
00:09:48,929 --> 00:09:50,999
You think I enjoy living like this?

199
00:09:51,169 --> 00:09:53,842
The shame? The humiliation?

200
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:56,239
You know, I've been issued
a public urination pass...

201
00:09:56,409 --> 00:09:58,161
...by the city because of my condition.

202
00:09:58,329 --> 00:10:01,719
Unfortunately, my little brother ran out
of the house with it this morning.

203
00:10:01,929 --> 00:10:04,762
Him and his friends are probably
peeing all over the place.

204
00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:07,887
Jerry!

205
00:10:08,329 --> 00:10:11,605
Jerry!

206
00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:13,566
Unbelievable.

207
00:10:13,729 --> 00:10:15,845
I'm never gonna get out of here.

208
00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:17,847
Guy goes to pee,
he never comes back.

209
00:10:18,009 --> 00:10:19,601
It's like a science-fiction story.

210
00:10:20,529 --> 00:10:22,520
Maybe he went
to one of the other levels.

211
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:24,600
- I'm gonna look for him.
- Now you're gonna go?

212
00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:26,566
- Be back in five minutes.
- If you go now...

213
00:10:26,729 --> 00:10:30,244
...we'll find the car, Jerry will show up
and we'll never find you!

214
00:10:30,409 --> 00:10:32,286
I'll be right back.

215
00:10:33,809 --> 00:10:37,006
What's the difference?
We'll all be dead eventually.

216
00:10:37,809 --> 00:10:39,879
Does that bother you?

217
00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:42,207
Yeah, it bothers me.

218
00:10:42,369 --> 00:10:45,645
- Doesn't it bother you?
- Not at all.

219
00:10:45,969 --> 00:10:48,199
Now, that bothers me even more
than dying bothers me.

220
00:10:48,369 --> 00:10:50,246
Because people like you
live to be 120...

221
00:10:50,409 --> 00:10:52,047
...because you're not bothered by it.

222
00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:53,927
How can it not bother you?

223
00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:58,367
Well, I once saw this thing on TV
with people who are terminally ill.

224
00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:00,759
Every one of them believed
that the secret of life...

225
00:11:00,929 --> 00:11:02,601
...is just to live every moment.

226
00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:04,521
Yeah, I've heard that.

227
00:11:04,689 --> 00:11:08,682
Meanwhile, I'm here with you
in a parking garage in Jersey.

228
00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:11,406
That's a nice jacket.
Where'd you get that?

229
00:11:11,569 --> 00:11:14,641
Some guy left it
over at my mother's house.

230
00:11:14,809 --> 00:11:18,518
First of all, you don't even know,
technically, that I went.

231
00:11:18,689 --> 00:11:20,008
That's for starters.

232
00:11:20,169 --> 00:11:22,842
I mean, I could have been pouring
a bottle of water out there.

233
00:11:23,569 --> 00:11:26,447
- I know what you did.
- Oh, really? Do you? Well...

234
00:11:26,609 --> 00:11:28,918
...it just so happens
that I did pour water out.

235
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:32,684
I had a bottle of very tepid water
and I poured it out.

236
00:11:32,849 --> 00:11:34,441
I could see how you made
a mistake...

237
00:11:34,609 --> 00:11:38,648
...because pouring water out sounds
very much like a person urinating.

238
00:11:38,809 --> 00:11:40,845
And, you know,
when you think about it...

239
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:44,206
...it's really quite an amusing case
of mistaken identity.

240
00:11:44,369 --> 00:11:45,961
And that's all it is.

241
00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:48,962
And now he's gone.
I'm sure he's looking for the car.

242
00:11:49,129 --> 00:11:51,245
Five minutes, that's all.
I just wanna find him.

243
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:54,048
- I can't do it.
- But why? Why can't you do it?

244
00:11:54,209 --> 00:11:55,608
I can't.

245
00:11:55,769 --> 00:11:58,203
That's not a reason, "You can't."
You just don't want to.

246
00:11:58,609 --> 00:11:59,928
That's right.

247
00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:01,841
But why? Why don't you want to?

248
00:12:02,609 --> 00:12:04,201
I don't know.

249
00:12:05,009 --> 00:12:08,001
Well, wouldn't you get any satisfaction
out of helping someone out?

250
00:12:08,169 --> 00:12:10,763
No, I wouldn't.

251
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:19,285
All right. All right.

252
00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:22,247
I... I want to apologize.

253
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:23,762
I was frightened.

254
00:12:23,929 --> 00:12:26,045
I said crazy things,
I obviously offended you...

255
00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:28,279
...I insulted your intelligence.

256
00:12:28,449 --> 00:12:31,521
The uromysitisis, the water bottle...

257
00:12:31,689 --> 00:12:33,407
...I made all that up.

258
00:12:33,569 --> 00:12:35,764
And now I'm gonna tell you the truth.

259
00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:39,684
Today my parents are celebrating...

260
00:12:39,849 --> 00:12:43,205
...their 50th-
Well, I'm jumping ahead here.

261
00:12:43,369 --> 00:12:45,758
Their 47th wedding anniversary.

262
00:12:45,929 --> 00:12:49,126
And we made plans to spend
the evening together.

263
00:12:49,289 --> 00:12:52,201
They're meeting me
in front of my building at 6: 15.

264
00:12:52,369 --> 00:12:54,280
What I haven't told you...

265
00:12:54,569 --> 00:12:57,003
...or anyone else, for that matter...

266
00:12:58,129 --> 00:13:00,404
...is that my father's been
in a Red Chinese prison...

267
00:13:00,569 --> 00:13:02,685
...for the past 14 years.

268
00:13:03,129 --> 00:13:04,926
I mean, the guy had a fat fetish.

269
00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:08,445
The inspector never dated a woman
under 250 pounds.

270
00:13:08,609 --> 00:13:12,204
- Really.
- What did he do with all that fat?

271
00:13:12,369 --> 00:13:14,325
Does he just jump up and down on it?

272
00:13:14,489 --> 00:13:17,162
Or does he gouge it
like Killer Kowalski?

273
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:19,638
- Who's Killer Kowalski?
- He was a wrestler.

274
00:13:19,809 --> 00:13:21,242
He would get down on his knees...

275
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:23,525
...and he'd grab ahold
of someone's stomach...

276
00:13:23,689 --> 00:13:25,088
...and squeeze it till they gave.

277
00:13:25,249 --> 00:13:28,286
Hey, hey, hey.
I have to go to the bathroom.

278
00:13:28,449 --> 00:13:30,007
Why don't you just go.

279
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:32,165
What, here?

280
00:13:32,849 --> 00:13:34,999
You and Jerry. It's...

281
00:13:36,609 --> 00:13:37,962
Okay.

282
00:13:38,369 --> 00:13:40,758
All right, I'm gonna
go down this row.

283
00:13:52,689 --> 00:13:56,238
What? What did I do?
I didn't do anything.

284
00:13:56,409 --> 00:13:59,799
Kramer! Kramer!

285
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:06,161
What? Don't you believe me?
It's their 47th anniversary.

286
00:14:06,449 --> 00:14:08,041
You know, this is gonna kill them.

287
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:10,279
You're aware of that? Kill them.

288
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:12,121
On the biggest night of their life.

289
00:14:12,289 --> 00:14:14,849
Your folks have
an anniversary today too?

290
00:14:17,769 --> 00:14:20,283
Was your father also
in a Red Chinese prison?

291
00:14:20,809 --> 00:14:22,128
Red Chinese prison?

292
00:14:24,409 --> 00:14:27,207
George!

293
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:30,009
George!

294
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:32,842
Jerry!

295
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:37,319
Jerry!

296
00:14:38,009 --> 00:14:39,886
You know when you're walking
with someone...

297
00:14:40,049 --> 00:14:42,961
...and you assume
that they know where the car is?

298
00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:47,407
And you're fine until you see them
do this move. Once they do this:

299
00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:54,919
When they look back from
where they came from...

300
00:14:55,089 --> 00:14:56,238
No, you're in bad shape now.

301
00:14:56,409 --> 00:14:59,719
Nobody that knows
where they're going does that.

302
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:03,848
Pilots on planes don't open
the cockpit door and go:

303
00:15:06,009 --> 00:15:07,362
Well, what happened was...

304
00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:10,646
...my father was staying with
one of China's great military leaders...

305
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:13,403
...General Chang, who, by the way,
came up with the recipe...

306
00:15:13,569 --> 00:15:16,720
...for General Chang's chicken. The
one with red pepper and orange peel...

307
00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:19,039
- ... at Szechwan Gardens?
- I eat it all the time. Spicy.

308
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,200
Apparently, General Chang
is a flamboyant man.

309
00:15:21,369 --> 00:15:24,247
Complete failure as a general,
but a hell of a cook.

310
00:15:25,449 --> 00:15:26,928
Look at this.

311
00:15:27,089 --> 00:15:29,523
Look at this. Will you look at this?

312
00:15:29,689 --> 00:15:33,364
He doesn't have enough with the
Mercedes, he has to have two spaces.

313
00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:36,566
I tell you, you know what I'd like
to do? I'd like to spit on it.

314
00:15:36,729 --> 00:15:38,481
I would like to see that.

315
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:41,482
- Should I? Should I do it?
- Teach him a lesson he'll never forget.

316
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,879
- Who does he think he is?
- Someone's gotta stop him.

317
00:15:44,049 --> 00:15:47,166
- It's against the law, isn't it?
- Well, it certainly should be.

318
00:15:48,049 --> 00:15:49,607
Okay.

319
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:55,042
This is some machine.

320
00:15:55,209 --> 00:15:57,404
Leave it to the Germans.

321
00:15:58,409 --> 00:16:00,320
Let me ask you something.

322
00:16:00,489 --> 00:16:02,957
What do they get
for a tune-up on this?

323
00:16:05,809 --> 00:16:07,367
- Jerry!
- Elaine!

324
00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:08,723
Where have you been?

325
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:11,323
- I was arrested for urinating.
- Me too.

326
00:16:11,489 --> 00:16:13,719
- You what?
- I have uromysitisis.

327
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,368
It's very serious, you know.

328
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:17,247
Jerry, look at my fish.

329
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:21,318
- Is he...?
- No, but he's not looking good.

330
00:16:22,609 --> 00:16:25,203
Please. We can't find our car.

331
00:16:25,369 --> 00:16:28,805
Please, just drive us around
the parking lot to find our car.

332
00:16:28,969 --> 00:16:31,039
- My fish are dying.
- Sorry. Can't do it.

333
00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:33,882
I can see not caring
what happens to us. We're human.

334
00:16:34,049 --> 00:16:37,325
But what about the fish? The fish?

335
00:16:37,489 --> 00:16:38,808
Sorry.

336
00:16:39,089 --> 00:16:40,727
That's right, go.

337
00:16:40,889 --> 00:16:42,607
Go home to your dumbbells.

338
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:47,365
Go work on your pecs and your lats.
We're all really impressed.

339
00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:49,599
Yeah, that's right. You heard me.

340
00:16:49,769 --> 00:16:54,001
- You got a problem with that?
- Elaine, shut up.

341
00:16:54,169 --> 00:16:57,241
Don't worry, I'm packing heat.

342
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:59,128
Hey, hey. Where's Kramer?

343
00:16:59,289 --> 00:17:01,041
- I don't know.
- I thought he was with you.

344
00:17:01,209 --> 00:17:03,120
Oh, see? See? I knew
this was gonna happen.

345
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:04,961
Look at the time. All right, that's it.

346
00:17:05,129 --> 00:17:07,085
Did we look over there?
We check that side?

347
00:17:07,249 --> 00:17:09,809
- We came in over there.
- We didn't come in over there.

348
00:17:09,969 --> 00:17:11,687
- Where's Kramer?
- Look at these cars...

349
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:13,248
...they all look exactly alike.

350
00:17:17,009 --> 00:17:18,806
The fumes.

351
00:17:18,969 --> 00:17:20,288
I can't breathe.

352
00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:23,361
I'm having trouble breathing.

353
00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:30,009
Hey, George, there she is again.

354
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:32,761
What are you doing?
You're killing me.

355
00:17:33,449 --> 00:17:35,724
Ask her to drive us around.
There's your opening.

356
00:17:38,369 --> 00:17:40,405
That is an opening.

357
00:17:42,369 --> 00:17:45,281
Excuse me. I'm really...

358
00:17:45,449 --> 00:17:47,041
See, what happened...

359
00:17:47,209 --> 00:17:50,804
- ... my friend forgot where he parked...
- Sure, I'll drive you around.

360
00:17:51,329 --> 00:17:52,682
- You will?
- Sure.

361
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:54,438
Thank you. Thank you.

362
00:17:54,609 --> 00:17:58,124
We're late and my parents are waiting
for me and we're stuck here.

363
00:17:58,289 --> 00:18:01,167
Well, I wouldn't wanna get lost in here.
It smells like a toilet.

364
00:18:01,329 --> 00:18:03,638
- People are such animals.
- You're telling me.

365
00:18:03,809 --> 00:18:05,128
Filthy pigs.

366
00:18:05,809 --> 00:18:07,640
It's a brown Ford.

367
00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:10,323
This has happened to me too.
It's very frustrating.

368
00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:14,001
I've asked several people.
They wouldn't even answer me.

369
00:18:14,169 --> 00:18:16,558
I'm happy to do it.

370
00:18:17,649 --> 00:18:18,923
I'm Michele.

371
00:18:19,409 --> 00:18:22,845
Hi, Michele. I'm George.

372
00:18:31,809 --> 00:18:35,279
- Get out!
- But I didn't mean anything by it.

373
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:40,045
I don't even know L. Ron Hubbard.
I didn't know you were with that group.

374
00:18:40,209 --> 00:18:41,961
What about my fish?

375
00:18:42,129 --> 00:18:45,087
Boy, those Scientologists,
they can be pretty sensitive.

376
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,967
I'll say.

377
00:18:47,129 --> 00:18:49,848
What is it? The car!

378
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:51,806
- The car!
- The car!

379
00:18:51,969 --> 00:18:56,247
- The car!
- I can't believe it!

380
00:18:56,409 --> 00:18:59,879
Kramer. Kramer's not here.
I knew it.

381
00:19:00,049 --> 00:19:01,687
I knew it. I knew this would happen.

382
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,966
- Kramer! Kramer!
- Kramer!

383
00:19:05,609 --> 00:19:08,043
Kramer!

384
00:19:14,769 --> 00:19:16,361
Hey, look.

385
00:19:16,609 --> 00:19:19,077
Boy, I had a hell of a time finding
that air conditioner.

386
00:19:19,249 --> 00:19:20,762
You know I looked everywhere?

387
00:19:20,929 --> 00:19:23,727
I completely forgot where I hid it.

388
00:19:23,889 --> 00:19:25,481
You know where it was?

389
00:19:25,649 --> 00:19:29,358
- Purple 23.
- Right. Purple 23.

390
00:19:29,529 --> 00:19:31,087
I could have used you.

391
00:19:31,249 --> 00:19:33,683
Sometimes it's good to write
those things down.

392
00:19:33,849 --> 00:19:36,522
Oh, boy. What time is it?

393
00:19:36,689 --> 00:19:38,327
7:45.

394
00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:42,517
Well, at least there'll be no traffic.

395
00:19:43,489 --> 00:19:44,842
Right.

396
00:19:45,969 --> 00:19:47,561
Oh, boy.

397
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,759
- What time does that play start?
-8:00.

398
00:19:54,329 --> 00:19:55,648
Well, that could be a problem.

399
00:19:56,889 --> 00:19:59,084
Where's your little bag of...

400
00:20:01,129 --> 00:20:03,643
All right, let's giddyup.

401
00:20:25,249 --> 00:20:27,319
See, the problem
with the mall garage...

402
00:20:27,489 --> 00:20:30,879
...is that everything looks the same.

403
00:20:31,089 --> 00:20:33,080
They try to differentiate it.

404
00:20:33,249 --> 00:20:36,286
They put up different colours,
different numbers, different letters.

405
00:20:36,449 --> 00:20:38,440
What they need to do
is name the levels like:

406
00:20:38,609 --> 00:20:40,645
"Your mother's a whore."
You know what I mean?

407
00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:42,367
You would remember that.

408
00:20:42,529 --> 00:20:45,487
You'd go, "I know, I'm parked at
'My father's an abusive alcoholic.'

409
00:20:45,649 --> 00:20:47,526
I know where I parked."

410
