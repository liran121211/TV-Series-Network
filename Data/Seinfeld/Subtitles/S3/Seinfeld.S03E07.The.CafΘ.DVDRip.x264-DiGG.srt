1
00:00:03,609 --> 00:00:06,248
There's always one location
in your neighbourhood, one store...

2
00:00:06,409 --> 00:00:08,718
...that's constantly changing hands.

3
00:00:08,929 --> 00:00:11,443
Everybody has this in their
neighbourhood. It's a leather store...

4
00:00:11,609 --> 00:00:13,725
...then it's a yoghurt shop,
it's a pet supply.

5
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:16,244
It's constantly changing.
Nobody can do business there.

6
00:00:16,409 --> 00:00:18,718
It's like some sort of
Bermuda Triangle of retail.

7
00:00:18,889 --> 00:00:22,962
Stores open up and then
they just disappear without a trace.

8
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:24,528
Nobody knows what happened.

9
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:28,807
Eventually, when aliens land and the
mothership from Close Encounters-

10
00:00:29,009 --> 00:00:32,558
The bottom will slowly open and all
these store owners will wander out...

11
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:36,563
...in a daze, going, "I thought there
was gonna be more walk-in traffic."

12
00:00:39,369 --> 00:00:40,358
She thinks I'm nice.

13
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:44,008
- Women don't want nice.
- Amazing.

14
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:46,922
I haven't seen one person go in
that restaurant since it opened.

15
00:00:47,249 --> 00:00:50,127
- Poor guy.
- Why is nice bad?

16
00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:53,326
What kind of a sick society are
we living in when nice is bad?

17
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:55,207
What's that smell?
What are you wearing?

18
00:00:55,369 --> 00:00:57,121
What? A little cologne.

19
00:00:57,489 --> 00:00:58,524
Manly.

20
00:00:58,729 --> 00:01:01,004
- Monica wants me to wear it.
- Why didn't you say no?

21
00:01:01,169 --> 00:01:02,397
I'm too nice.

22
00:01:02,569 --> 00:01:05,641
Look at this poor guy. His family's
probably back in Pakistan waiting...

23
00:01:05,809 --> 00:01:07,242
...for him to send back money.

24
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:09,320
This is horrible.

25
00:01:09,489 --> 00:01:10,763
She wants me to take an IQ test.

26
00:01:10,929 --> 00:01:13,397
It's because you're stupid enough
to wear the cologne.

27
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:17,478
No. She's taking this course
in education for her master's.

28
00:01:17,649 --> 00:01:20,482
It's part of her research project,
so I have to be a guinea pig.

29
00:01:20,649 --> 00:01:23,482
I've never been a guinea pig.
Been a sheep, been a toady...

30
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,608
I can't talk to you anymore.

31
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:28,203
All right, I'm sorry. Go ahead.
You're taking the IQ test.

32
00:01:28,369 --> 00:01:29,961
She's gonna find out I'm a moron.

33
00:01:30,249 --> 00:01:33,082
People think I'm smart,
but I'm not smart.

34
00:01:33,249 --> 00:01:35,080
Who thinks you're smart?

35
00:01:35,249 --> 00:01:36,841
I won't break 100 on this thing.

36
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:39,569
- What thing?
- You don't listen anymore.

37
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:41,560
Oh, the IQ thing. Yeah.

38
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:44,040
I'm sure I have a low IQ.

39
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:46,245
I've been lying about my SAT scores
for 15 years.

40
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:49,401
- What did you get?
- What did I get, or what do I say I got?

41
00:01:49,569 --> 00:01:51,844
- What do you say?
- I say 1409.

42
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:54,119
-1409, that's a good score.
- You're telling me.

43
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:55,881
What did you really get?

44
00:01:56,089 --> 00:01:57,488
- You're my friend.
- Of course.

45
00:01:57,649 --> 00:01:59,401
- I tell you everything, right?
- I hope so.

46
00:01:59,569 --> 00:02:02,481
Well, this I take to the grave.

47
00:02:02,809 --> 00:02:05,369
He's serving Mexican,
Italian, Chinese.

48
00:02:05,649 --> 00:02:08,038
He's all over the place.
That's why no one's going in.

49
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:10,086
Why do you keep watching?

50
00:02:10,249 --> 00:02:12,365
I don't know. I'm obsessed with it.

51
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:17,407
It's like a spider in the toilet,
struggling for survival.

52
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:19,721
And even though you know
he's not gonna make it...

53
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,800
...you root for him for a second.

54
00:02:21,969 --> 00:02:23,402
Then you flush.

55
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:26,765
Well, it's a spider.

56
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:29,761
Sometimes people
won't go in a place...

57
00:02:29,929 --> 00:02:32,363
...if they don't see anyone else
in there.

58
00:02:32,529 --> 00:02:36,886
Do you have to do that? Jerry, don't
do that. That is so annoying.

59
00:02:37,249 --> 00:02:38,523
Bazooka Joe.

60
00:02:46,849 --> 00:02:48,805
- The buzzer?
- It's your house.

61
00:02:49,449 --> 00:02:52,839
My house. You gotta be on the lease
to press the buzzer.

62
00:02:53,809 --> 00:02:55,288
- Yeah?
- It's George.

63
00:02:55,449 --> 00:02:56,848
Come on up.

64
00:02:57,009 --> 00:02:59,682
- Casus beli.
- What's that?

65
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:03,398
It's Latin. I read it in some book.
I just wanted to say it out loud.

66
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:04,843
Come on, go in.

67
00:03:05,369 --> 00:03:06,961
Go in.

68
00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:10,522
- Have you gone in there?
- No. I'm afraid we'll start talking...

69
00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:12,998
...and I'll wind up going partners
with him.

70
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:15,248
Hey.

71
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:24,321
I could probably shoot him from here.
I'd be doing us both a favour.

72
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:30,887
I'm wearing some cologne, all right?

73
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:33,006
Sure. Fine.

74
00:03:33,369 --> 00:03:35,246
Casus beli.

75
00:03:36,369 --> 00:03:38,837
Casus beli.

76
00:03:39,409 --> 00:03:42,082
- What's that?
- Since when do you wear cologne?

77
00:03:42,249 --> 00:03:43,841
Why is what I do so important?

78
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:46,159
Why must I always be the focal point
of attention?

79
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:48,160
Let me just be. Let me live.

80
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:53,161
- How'd you do on that IQ test?
- I didn't take it yet.

81
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:54,967
- What IQ test?
- What's casus beli?

82
00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:58,280
- Oh, it's nothing.
- Is it about me?

83
00:03:58,449 --> 00:04:00,644
Why must you always be
the focal point of attention?

84
00:04:00,809 --> 00:04:03,562
Why can't you just be?
Why can't you live?

85
00:04:05,169 --> 00:04:09,321
It's just a Latin phrase. It does not
mean anything. Now, what is this test?

86
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:12,606
This woman he's dating is making him
take this IQ test for this course.

87
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:14,919
- Oh, that sounds like fun.
- Yeah, fun.

88
00:04:15,609 --> 00:04:19,079
IQ tests are totally bogus.
They prove nothing.

89
00:04:19,249 --> 00:04:22,082
- You'll do well. You're smart.
- No, see, he's not smart.

90
00:04:22,249 --> 00:04:25,480
People think he's smart,
but he's not.

91
00:04:25,649 --> 00:04:27,446
What did you get on your SATs?

92
00:04:28,089 --> 00:04:29,761
It varies.

93
00:04:30,849 --> 00:04:34,922
- I don't even know my IQ.
- Mine's 145.

94
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:38,288
- One forty-five!
- Get out of here.

95
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:40,679
- You get out of here.
- You get out of here.

96
00:04:42,209 --> 00:04:44,120
Maybe you should take the test for me.

97
00:04:44,289 --> 00:04:47,361
That would be something,
cheating on an IQ test.

98
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:49,924
Remember in college when you
passed Lettick the test...

99
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:51,317
...out the window?

100
00:04:51,489 --> 00:04:54,606
- You became a legend after that.
- Yeah.

101
00:04:54,769 --> 00:04:57,488
Yeah, I really had some guts
back then.

102
00:04:58,929 --> 00:05:01,489
- Why don't we do it again?
- What?

103
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:03,241
You could take the IQ test for me.

104
00:05:03,409 --> 00:05:06,242
I'll pass it to you out of a window.
She lives on the first floor.

105
00:05:06,409 --> 00:05:07,728
- You serious?
- Why not?

106
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:09,720
Where would I take the test?

107
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:12,687
She lives around the corner.
Take it here or go to the coffee shop.

108
00:05:12,849 --> 00:05:14,885
- No, too noisy.
- Take it at the Dream Café.

109
00:05:15,049 --> 00:05:16,243
You won't hear a peep.

110
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:21,244
- Hey, what do you think?
- Hey, I love a good caper.

111
00:05:22,769 --> 00:05:26,921
Yeah, that's what it is, isn't it?
A caper.

112
00:05:27,089 --> 00:05:28,568
You'll do it?

113
00:05:29,489 --> 00:05:32,049
- What the hey.
- Yeah! Beautiful!

114
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:34,120
Sorry.

115
00:05:39,529 --> 00:05:44,444
- Welcome to the Dream Café.
- Well, I've been looking forward to it.

116
00:05:44,609 --> 00:05:46,759
How did you hear about us?

117
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,840
People. People are talking.

118
00:05:50,929 --> 00:05:53,807
Smoking or nonsmoking?
We are proud to offer both.

119
00:05:53,969 --> 00:05:56,039
- Nonsmoking would be great.
- Very good.

120
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:59,884
My name is Babu Bhatt.
I will be your waiter.

121
00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:02,763
A steaming hot, folded face cloth
for your pleasure.

122
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:05,807
- Thank you.
- Our specials are tacos...

123
00:06:05,969 --> 00:06:08,005
...moussaka and franks and beans.

124
00:06:09,249 --> 00:06:12,047
Well, what do you recommend,
my good fellow?

125
00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:15,048
- The turkey.
- Well, the turkey it'll be.

126
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:17,769
May I say you have a splendid
establishment here, my friend.

127
00:06:17,929 --> 00:06:20,921
I'm sure you'll flourish at this location
for many, many years.

128
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,239
You're a very kind man.
Very kind. Thank you.

129
00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:25,328
Very kind.

130
00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:29,486
Very kind. I am a kind man.

131
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:32,522
Who else would do something
lik e this? Nobody.

132
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,004
Nobody thinks about people
the way I do.

133
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:36,848
Snap out of it, you stupid jerk.

134
00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:39,398
You're eating a turk ey sandwich.
You want a Nobel Prize?

135
00:06:39,729 --> 00:06:42,038
You go in the living room,
I'll take the test in here.

136
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:43,403
But why?

137
00:06:43,929 --> 00:06:46,124
I won't be able to concentrate
in front of you.

138
00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:50,123
I think you're making too much of this.
IQ tests don't mean anything.

139
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:51,608
Are you kidding me?

140
00:06:52,529 --> 00:06:56,363
This is the best tool we have today
of measuring a person's intelligence.

141
00:06:56,529 --> 00:06:59,089
Well, I certainly don't place
any importance on it.

142
00:06:59,249 --> 00:07:01,319
Well, I think you're wrong about that.

143
00:07:02,609 --> 00:07:06,443
And now, if you'll excuse me,
I'd really like to get started, please.

144
00:07:07,249 --> 00:07:08,648
- Good luck.
- Don't need it.

145
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,999
What's going on?
I've been here 20 minutes.

146
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:17,285
I'm sorry. Here's the test.
Thanks for doing this.

147
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:20,202
- What time do you want me back?
- Twenty to 3.

148
00:07:20,409 --> 00:07:21,683
- Okay.
- Thanks again.

149
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:25,126
And don't settle for 145.
You can do better. You're a genius.

150
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:34,045
Thank you, Babu.

151
00:07:34,929 --> 00:07:39,002
You have quite a flair. You are
quite the restaurateur, I must say.

152
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,882
- It is indeed my pleasure.
- Oh, please.

153
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:45,727
Welcome to the Dream Café.

154
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:49,719
- Our specials today-
- Oh, no, no. I'll just have tea and toast.

155
00:07:51,049 --> 00:07:53,882
- Tea and toast.
- Eat something! Babu.

156
00:07:55,329 --> 00:07:56,523
Okay.

157
00:07:56,849 --> 00:07:59,727
Well, I'll have the rigatoni.

158
00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:03,359
Oh, very good choice.
Very good.

159
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:07,361
So you got the test. You're cheating.

160
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:09,761
I know.

161
00:08:10,049 --> 00:08:12,324
- Hey.
- Hey.

162
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:16,607
Oh, boy.

163
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:20,367
Jerry, let me ask you something.

164
00:08:20,529 --> 00:08:22,247
- Hi, Elaine.
- Hey.

165
00:08:22,489 --> 00:08:26,277
This guy leaves this jacket
at my mother's house two years ago.

166
00:08:26,689 --> 00:08:30,841
She hasn't spoken to him since and
now he says he wants the jacket back.

167
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:33,882
- So?
- Well, I'm not giving it back.

168
00:08:34,489 --> 00:08:35,524
Why not?

169
00:08:35,689 --> 00:08:39,318
Because I meet a lot of women in
this jacket. They're attracted to it.

170
00:08:39,489 --> 00:08:41,798
Why do you think my mother
went out with him?

171
00:08:44,809 --> 00:08:46,447
- You all right?
- Yeah. Okay.

172
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,440
What?

173
00:08:53,729 --> 00:08:55,765
Anyway, it's been two years.

174
00:08:56,129 --> 00:08:58,768
I mean, isn't there, like, a statue
of limitations on that?

175
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:00,522
Statute.

176
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:03,603
- What?
- Statute of limitations.

177
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:05,646
It's not a statue.

178
00:09:06,449 --> 00:09:07,643
No, it's statue.

179
00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:10,923
Fine. It's a sculpture of limitations.

180
00:09:11,689 --> 00:09:14,965
Wait a minute. Just wait a minute.
Elaine. Elaine.

181
00:09:15,329 --> 00:09:19,163
Now, you're smart. Is it "statue"
or "statute"of limitations?

182
00:09:19,329 --> 00:09:22,958
- Statute.
- Oh, I really think you're wrong.

183
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:27,243
Kramer, I have to take this test.
I don't have a lot of time.

184
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:29,807
What test?

185
00:09:30,609 --> 00:09:34,045
- An IQ test.
- Why are you taking an IQ test?

186
00:09:34,209 --> 00:09:36,359
- It's for George.
- George?

187
00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:39,159
Look, can I explain it to you later?

188
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,320
But why are you taking
an IQ test for George?

189
00:09:41,489 --> 00:09:42,763
Would you please?!

190
00:09:42,969 --> 00:09:45,767
- Is it for a job or something?
- Later!

191
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:51,806
- You're positive it's statute?
- Yes! Yes!

192
00:09:52,329 --> 00:09:54,763
Welcome, welcome.
A steaming hot face cloth-

193
00:10:06,169 --> 00:10:09,002
- George?
- Yeah?

194
00:10:09,569 --> 00:10:11,400
The door's locked.

195
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,161
Oh, it's locked?

196
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:15,685
I need to get something.

197
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:19,200
Monica, I'm really focused here.
This stuff's a killer.

198
00:10:19,569 --> 00:10:22,129
- George!
- Wish I could.

199
00:10:31,689 --> 00:10:33,088
Babu!

200
00:10:33,329 --> 00:10:35,797
If you don't mind...
Okay.

201
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:39,678
- I'll get this.
- Oh, my God! It's all over the test!

202
00:10:39,849 --> 00:10:43,398
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Oh, man!

203
00:10:43,569 --> 00:10:46,083
- I'm out of time, anyway.
- Please forgive me. Please.

204
00:10:46,249 --> 00:10:48,046
Go ahead. I'll take care of it.

205
00:10:48,929 --> 00:10:50,920
Please, I'm very sorry.

206
00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:53,366
Tell your friends.

207
00:11:02,609 --> 00:11:05,077
It's all right.
She was cheating anyway.

208
00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:08,365
You're a very kind man.

209
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:10,288
Babu...

210
00:11:11,009 --> 00:11:14,763
- You're Pakistani, right?
- Yes, Pakistani. Yes.

211
00:11:15,449 --> 00:11:17,917
Babu, may I say something?

212
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:20,364
Of course. You're very smart man.
I listen.

213
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:24,681
I am not a restaurateur by any means,
but it occurred to me that perhaps...

214
00:11:24,849 --> 00:11:27,682
...you might serve some dishes
from your native Pakistan...

215
00:11:27,849 --> 00:11:30,761
...as opposed to, say,
the franks and beans, for example.

216
00:11:31,409 --> 00:11:33,877
- There are no Pakistani people here.
- It doesn't matter.

217
00:11:34,049 --> 00:11:37,166
You would have the only authentic
Pakistani restaurant...

218
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:38,762
...in the whole neighbourhood.

219
00:11:39,489 --> 00:11:41,161
Yes.

220
00:11:41,609 --> 00:11:44,646
You see everything, don't you?

221
00:11:45,169 --> 00:11:49,003
Well, you know, not everything.
I do what I can.

222
00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:55,002
I close down today. And when I open
again, it will be a Pakistani restaurant.

223
00:11:55,489 --> 00:11:59,038
Thank you. Thank you so much.
You're a very special person.

224
00:11:59,209 --> 00:12:00,688
Very special.

225
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,720
I am such a great guy.

226
00:12:04,969 --> 00:12:07,563
Who else would've gone to the
trouble to help this immigrant?

227
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:11,245
I am special. My mother was right.

228
00:12:11,409 --> 00:12:15,846
Of course, I've never had
Pakistani food. How bad could it be?

229
00:12:20,049 --> 00:12:24,122
- It was an accident.
- What, did you go on a picnic?

230
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,724
Babu Bhatt did it.

231
00:12:28,929 --> 00:12:30,885
Babu Bhatt?

232
00:12:31,569 --> 00:12:34,447
- How am I going to explain this?
- Time's up, George.

233
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:37,760
Okay.

234
00:12:44,049 --> 00:12:45,323
- Here you go.
- How did you do?

235
00:12:45,489 --> 00:12:48,447
- Piece of cake.
- What happened to the test?

236
00:12:48,609 --> 00:12:51,248
What? Oh, I spilled some food on it.

237
00:12:53,049 --> 00:12:55,165
Food? What food?

238
00:12:55,569 --> 00:12:56,843
What are you talking about?

239
00:12:57,489 --> 00:12:58,717
Where did you get food?

240
00:12:59,049 --> 00:13:01,244
- From my pocket.
- Your pocket?

241
00:13:03,129 --> 00:13:05,723
I had a sandwich in my pocket.

242
00:13:06,969 --> 00:13:09,927
- And coffee?
- Yeah. Had some coffee, yeah.

243
00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:14,764
- Where did you get the coffee?
- Where did I get the coffee?

244
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:17,568
Where do you think I got the coffee?
At the grocery store.

245
00:13:17,969 --> 00:13:19,880
- How did you get there?
- I walked.

246
00:13:20,489 --> 00:13:23,003
How did you get out?
I didn't see you leave.

247
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:26,684
- I climbed out the window.
- You climbed out the window?

248
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:29,488
- Of course.
- Why didn't you go out the door?

249
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,447
The door?

250
00:13:33,089 --> 00:13:36,684
Why would I go out the door?
The window's right here.

251
00:13:39,409 --> 00:13:42,048
You're a fascinating man,
George Costanza.

252
00:13:45,209 --> 00:13:47,803
The average person sees a situation
like this...

253
00:13:48,329 --> 00:13:49,808
...they walk right by it.

254
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:53,607
- Not me.
- You're very special.

255
00:13:55,849 --> 00:13:57,077
Hey, do me a favour.

256
00:13:57,249 --> 00:14:00,446
Some guy comes looking for me,
tell him you don't know where I am.

257
00:14:00,609 --> 00:14:02,600
Of course. I always do.

258
00:14:02,969 --> 00:14:06,439
No, no, it's that guy. He's really
been bugging me about the jacket.

259
00:14:06,609 --> 00:14:09,077
- Just give it back to him.
- He'll have to kill me.

260
00:14:14,529 --> 00:14:17,646
- Hey, Georgie!
- I'm coming up.

261
00:14:17,849 --> 00:14:20,283
How did you do on the IQ test?

262
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:22,121
Eighty-five!

263
00:14:24,449 --> 00:14:30,046
- What?
- Eighty-five, Jerry! 85 IQ.

264
00:14:32,209 --> 00:14:33,562
Eighty-five?

265
00:14:33,729 --> 00:14:36,482
Well, well, well...

266
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:38,728
He's coming up?

267
00:14:38,929 --> 00:14:40,442
Well, I'm no genius...

268
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:45,279
...but according to my calculations,
he should be here in a few seconds.

269
00:14:46,369 --> 00:14:48,837
Yeah, but an 85?
Jerry, that's ridiculous.

270
00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:51,239
Well, maybe the test
was gender-biased.

271
00:14:51,409 --> 00:14:54,242
You know, a lot of questions
on hunting and testicles.

272
00:15:00,529 --> 00:15:03,202
Oh, hello, professor.

273
00:15:06,449 --> 00:15:08,917
- George, I cannot believe-
- Please.

274
00:15:09,129 --> 00:15:13,327
- No, there's gotta be a mistake.
- You should have seen her face.

275
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:15,287
It was the same look
my father gave me...

276
00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:18,168
...when I told him I wanted
to be a ventriloquist.

277
00:15:21,169 --> 00:15:22,682
But an 85?

278
00:15:22,929 --> 00:15:24,965
Listen, there were too many
distractions there.

279
00:15:25,129 --> 00:15:30,123
Babu whatever his name was.
And Kramer. I couldn't concentrate.

280
00:15:30,289 --> 00:15:32,883
It was a madhouse.

281
00:15:33,449 --> 00:15:35,246
Jerry, it was.

282
00:15:35,409 --> 00:15:37,798
- Let me take it again.
- Forget it.

283
00:15:37,969 --> 00:15:40,927
Oh, come on. Come on.
I'll guarantee you 140.

284
00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:43,080
- What do you have to lose?
- You could do worse!

285
00:15:43,249 --> 00:15:46,207
No. No, come on. I guarantee it.

286
00:15:46,929 --> 00:15:50,604
- All right, I'll ask her.
- Okay. Now, where am I gonna take it?

287
00:15:50,769 --> 00:15:54,603
Take it here. I'll leave.
There will be no distractions.

288
00:16:01,489 --> 00:16:04,765
Well, congratulations, my friend.

289
00:16:04,969 --> 00:16:08,200
Sorry I missed the grand reopening.
I was out of town for about a week.

290
00:16:08,529 --> 00:16:10,599
You see how I listen?

291
00:16:10,889 --> 00:16:13,608
I work very hard, borrow more money.

292
00:16:14,049 --> 00:16:17,803
I think it's fantastic. It has
a certain indefinable charm.

293
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:22,886
- You wish to eat?
- Let me tell you something, Babu.

294
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:26,439
You go back in that kitchen,
tell your chef I want the works.

295
00:16:26,769 --> 00:16:28,487
Very good.

296
00:16:31,689 --> 00:16:33,088
Very good?

297
00:16:33,249 --> 00:16:34,762
No, not very good...

298
00:16:34,929 --> 00:16:36,362
...very great.

299
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:39,601
I am very, very great.

300
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:53,767
The IQ tests always have that
sample question at the beginning...

301
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:56,284
...where they show you how
to fill in the circle.

302
00:16:57,289 --> 00:16:59,644
This should be the first
elimination point right there.

303
00:16:59,809 --> 00:17:01,288
Anybody goes outside that circle:

304
00:17:01,449 --> 00:17:04,646
"You wanna come with us, please?
Yeah, you're done. Your test is over.

305
00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:07,369
You went outside the circle, okay?"

306
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:22,565
- What are you doing?
- Quiet. Don't say anything.

307
00:17:22,729 --> 00:17:26,404
- What's going on?
- Hey, Kramer! I saw you go in there!

308
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:29,163
I'm not leaving till you
give me that jacket!

309
00:17:29,569 --> 00:17:32,208
- Open up, Kramer!
- What did you come in here for?

310
00:17:32,369 --> 00:17:35,247
Well, I thought I'd throw him off.
See, he knows where I live.

311
00:17:36,049 --> 00:17:39,086
Look, Kramer, I have to return
this test. I've gotta get out of here.

312
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:42,362
- I thought you took the test.
- I had to take it again.

313
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:44,838
- How come?
- What's the difference?!

314
00:17:45,169 --> 00:17:46,887
- Well, you can't leave now.
- What?

315
00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:49,438
Come on, Kramer,
I want that jacket back!

316
00:17:50,089 --> 00:17:51,966
Never!

317
00:17:54,929 --> 00:17:57,079
Come on, George, open up.

318
00:18:04,969 --> 00:18:07,767
- Well?
- How you doing?

319
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:11,127
Where's the test?

320
00:18:11,409 --> 00:18:13,798
You know, it's the damnedest thing.

321
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:16,927
I went out the window again
to get a cup of coffee...

322
00:18:23,489 --> 00:18:25,002
Babu...

323
00:18:26,129 --> 00:18:27,642
Babu.

324
00:18:31,689 --> 00:18:33,122
Babu...

325
00:18:33,369 --> 00:18:38,682
...you know, I've gotta tell you,
I never do this, but the shrimp...

326
00:18:39,169 --> 00:18:40,648
...it's just a little stringy.

327
00:18:42,009 --> 00:18:44,603
- You have any chicken?
- The shrimp is stringy?

328
00:18:44,769 --> 00:18:47,044
- Well, maybe you refrigerated-
- Quiet!

329
00:18:48,129 --> 00:18:49,881
- No, I-
- You shut up!

330
00:18:50,049 --> 00:18:53,200
You make me change restaurant,
but nobody come!

331
00:18:53,369 --> 00:18:57,248
You say make Pakistani. Babu Bhatt
have only Pakistani restaurant.

332
00:18:57,729 --> 00:19:01,438
But where are people? You see
people? Show me people!

333
00:19:01,609 --> 00:19:03,167
There are no people!

334
00:19:04,169 --> 00:19:06,444
- I think I'll just take the check.
- You bad man!

335
00:19:06,609 --> 00:19:08,839
You very, very bad man.

336
00:19:10,529 --> 00:19:14,283
Bad man? Could my mother
have been wrong?

337
00:19:23,969 --> 00:19:25,880
Are you looking for George?

338
00:19:26,129 --> 00:19:27,881
Well...

339
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:29,927
Kind of.

340
00:19:30,729 --> 00:19:32,367
George left.

341
00:19:34,129 --> 00:19:36,404
Is that the test?

342
00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:39,846
This?

343
00:19:40,809 --> 00:19:42,481
Yeah.

344
00:19:43,409 --> 00:19:45,400
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

345
00:19:47,249 --> 00:19:49,809
I hope you do a lot better this time.

346
00:19:53,089 --> 00:19:54,442
Actually, I think I did.

347
00:19:54,609 --> 00:19:59,399
The first time,
I couldn't really concentrate.

348
00:20:06,609 --> 00:20:09,123
You know what it was?
Bad location.

349
00:20:09,289 --> 00:20:12,520
Come on, let's not stand here
too long. We might run into her.

350
00:20:12,729 --> 00:20:15,038
Aren't you cold?
Where's your jacket?

351
00:20:15,609 --> 00:20:19,238
- Oh, sorry.
- I'm going upstairs.

352
00:20:20,729 --> 00:20:25,041
Hey, guys. I just ran into Monica.
You know what my IQ is?

353
00:20:25,489 --> 00:20:28,208
One fifty-one.

354
00:20:28,369 --> 00:20:30,599
- One fifty-one?
- Yeah.

355
00:20:32,369 --> 00:20:33,882
That's a good score.

356
00:20:34,169 --> 00:20:36,080
So, what are you up for?
How about Mexican?

357
00:20:36,249 --> 00:20:38,524
- Italian.
- No, Chinese.

358
00:20:38,929 --> 00:20:40,806
You know what would be great?

359
00:20:53,649 --> 00:20:57,164
It's tough to do a good deed. Let's look
at your professional good-deed doers:

360
00:20:57,329 --> 00:20:59,399
Your Lone Rangers, your Supermen...

361
00:20:59,649 --> 00:21:02,641
...your Batmen, your Spider-Men,
your Elastic Men.

362
00:21:03,289 --> 00:21:06,759
They're all wearing disguises. Masks
over their faces, secret identities.

363
00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:11,366
Don't want people to know
who they are. Too much aggravation.

364
00:21:12,089 --> 00:21:13,761
"Superman,
thanks for saving my life...

365
00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:16,568
...but did you have
to come through my wall?

366
00:21:16,969 --> 00:21:21,884
I'm renting here. They got a security
deposit. What am I supposed to do?"

367
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,280
