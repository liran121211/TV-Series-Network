1
00:00:02,289 --> 00:00:05,247
Every time somebody recommends
a doctor, he's always the best.

2
00:00:06,769 --> 00:00:09,647
"This guy's the best."
They can't all be the best.

3
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:11,606
There can't be this many bests.

4
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:14,682
Someone's graduating
at the bottom of these classes.

5
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:16,760
Where are these doctors?

6
00:00:17,049 --> 00:00:19,085
Is somewhere someone
saying to their friend:

7
00:00:19,249 --> 00:00:21,717
"You should see my doctor.
He's the worst.

8
00:00:22,049 --> 00:00:24,768
Oh, yeah. He's the worst.
He's the absolute worst there is.

9
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:28,205
Whatever you've got,
it'll be worse after you see him.

10
00:00:28,449 --> 00:00:31,202
He's just a- He's a butcher.
The man's a butcher."

11
00:00:32,089 --> 00:00:36,162
Then there's always that, "Make sure
you tell him that you know me."

12
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:38,320
Why? What's the difference?
He's a doctor.

13
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:40,844
What is he-?
"Oh, you know Bob.

14
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:44,206
Oh, okay, I'll give you
the real medicine.

15
00:00:45,009 --> 00:00:47,239
Everybody else
I'm giving Tic Tacs."

16
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:57,642
And usually for lunch, I'll have a salad.
And for dinner, I eat whatever I want.

17
00:00:58,369 --> 00:01:01,202
What do you think
the worst part of being blind is?

18
00:01:03,769 --> 00:01:04,963
Excuse me?

19
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:06,608
You know, if you were blind...

20
00:01:06,769 --> 00:01:09,363
...what do you think
the worst part of it would be?

21
00:01:10,369 --> 00:01:11,688
I don't know.

22
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:15,765
I think it would be not being able to tell
if there was bugs in my food.

23
00:01:19,849 --> 00:01:22,158
How could you ever
enjoy a meal like that?

24
00:01:22,329 --> 00:01:25,799
I'd constantly be feeling around
with my lips and my tongue.

25
00:01:26,929 --> 00:01:30,763
Well, that's how my 5-year-old eats.
He's a very picky eater.

26
00:01:30,929 --> 00:01:34,444
Hear about that kid that was kidnapped
the other day in Pennsylvania?

27
00:01:34,609 --> 00:01:36,122
No.

28
00:01:36,289 --> 00:01:39,008
He was at a carnival with his mother.
She gets a hot dog...

29
00:01:39,169 --> 00:01:42,081
...next thing you know,
she turns around, boom, he's gone.

30
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:46,482
Imagine how sick a person has to be
to do something like that.

31
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:49,004
And these people
are all over the place.

32
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:52,366
You never know who's crazy.
I could be one of these people.

33
00:01:54,609 --> 00:01:56,679
Have you seen any good movies?

34
00:01:56,849 --> 00:01:58,601
Who takes care of your boy
during the day?

35
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:01,078
We have a woman. Why?

36
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:04,004
- No, I'm just saying.
- She had references.

37
00:02:04,169 --> 00:02:06,763
I'm sure she did.
I'm sure they're impeccable.

38
00:02:06,929 --> 00:02:08,965
I'm talking about the ones
that forge them.

39
00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:15,725
You know,
I think this is really helping.

40
00:02:15,889 --> 00:02:17,527
I don't live near here, you know.

41
00:02:21,969 --> 00:02:25,041
So she's giving me the massage
and I'm just making conversation.

42
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:28,724
- I don't like to talk during a massage.
- Neither do I, but I do it for them.

43
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:30,959
- I figure they're bored.
- Yeah, I do that too.

44
00:02:31,129 --> 00:02:35,008
I feel guilty about getting the pleasure.
I feel like I don't deserve it, so I talk.

45
00:02:35,169 --> 00:02:36,887
It stops me from enjoying it.

46
00:02:37,049 --> 00:02:38,528
There's nothing to eat in here.

47
00:02:39,089 --> 00:02:41,478
- I forgot to tell you.
- I'm in the middle of a story.

48
00:02:41,649 --> 00:02:44,004
- Okay, go ahead.
- Why don't you ever go shopping?

49
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:46,285
It's not like it's a really funny story.

50
00:02:46,449 --> 00:02:49,964
- What happened?
- So she mentioned that she had a son.

51
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:51,687
And then for some reason...

52
00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:55,524
...I launch into the story about the kid
from Pennsylvania who was abducted.

53
00:02:55,689 --> 00:02:57,964
- Oh, wasn't that terrible?
- Yes, it was.

54
00:02:58,129 --> 00:02:59,323
Not even an apple.

55
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:01,480
She doesn't wanna hear that.
That was stupid.

56
00:03:01,649 --> 00:03:04,004
- I know it was stupid.
- Really stupid.

57
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:05,648
Hey, I just said it was stupid.

58
00:03:05,809 --> 00:03:07,879
- What about this Chinese food?
- Take it.

59
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:11,246
- I can't believe you said that.
- Hey, would you stop it already.

60
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,082
So, what did she say?

61
00:03:13,249 --> 00:03:15,160
She actually seemed
to get a little paranoid.

62
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:18,681
This is terrible.
What is this, ginger?

63
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:21,568
I hate ginger. I can't understand
how anyone can eat ginger.

64
00:03:21,729 --> 00:03:23,765
- I have a good masseuse.
- No, she's really good.

65
00:03:23,929 --> 00:03:26,238
She's not just a masseuse.
She's a physical therapist.

66
00:03:26,409 --> 00:03:28,764
There's a big difference.
She uses the ultrasound.

67
00:03:28,929 --> 00:03:30,282
It's a real medical procedure.

68
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:33,919
In fact, if you get a doctor's note,
it's covered by insurance.

69
00:03:36,289 --> 00:03:38,166
Physical therapy is covered
by insurance?

70
00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:39,557
Yeah.

71
00:03:39,729 --> 00:03:43,199
- You don't pay for the massage?
- Not if you have a doctor's note.

72
00:03:43,369 --> 00:03:45,007
So where do you get this note?

73
00:03:45,169 --> 00:03:47,399
I've never actually done it,
but if I wanted to...

74
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:49,958
...I could probably get one from Roy,
the dentist.

75
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:51,642
Right. Your friend Roy.

76
00:03:51,809 --> 00:03:53,640
What's the name
of this physical therapist?

77
00:03:53,809 --> 00:03:57,245
I'll tell you, but don't ask her anything
about her kid. She's a little off.

78
00:03:57,409 --> 00:03:59,479
And you don't have to pay?

79
00:04:01,249 --> 00:04:03,080
We have 3:00 appointments.

80
00:04:03,249 --> 00:04:05,319
- George and Elaine, right?
- Right.

81
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:07,719
Could you fill these out, please?

82
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:10,608
And, Elaine,
you'll be seeing Julianna.

83
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:13,727
And, George,
you'll be with Raymond.

84
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:20,360
Excuse me. Did you say Raymond?

85
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:21,797
Yes.

86
00:04:24,369 --> 00:04:27,645
But Raymond is a man.

87
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,282
That's right.

88
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:40,082
I can't get a massage from a man.

89
00:04:41,089 --> 00:04:42,568
- Why not?
- What, are you crazy?

90
00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:45,004
I can't have a man touching me.

91
00:04:45,289 --> 00:04:46,768
Switch with me.

92
00:04:46,929 --> 00:04:48,362
I don't want the man either.

93
00:04:49,809 --> 00:04:52,642
What? You're a woman.
They're supposed to be touching you.

94
00:04:52,809 --> 00:04:56,119
- He'd just be touching your back.
- He'd just be touching your back too.

95
00:04:56,289 --> 00:04:59,042
- No, it could get sexual.
- I know.

96
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:02,440
That's the point. If it's gonna get
sexual, it should get sexual with you.

97
00:05:02,609 --> 00:05:05,328
- I wouldn't be comfortable.
- I would?

98
00:05:05,489 --> 00:05:08,526
- What if something happens?
- Oh, what could happen?

99
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:12,200
What if it felt good?

100
00:05:14,609 --> 00:05:17,646
- It's supposed to feel good.
- I don't want it to feel good.

101
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:21,519
- Then why get the massage?
- Exactly.

102
00:05:26,569 --> 00:05:27,888
George.

103
00:05:31,849 --> 00:05:34,283
- Yes.
- I'm Raymond.

104
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:37,482
Hello.

105
00:05:39,209 --> 00:05:40,767
Are you ready?

106
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:53,926
And then Julianna asked me if
I wanted to join her here in the office.

107
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:55,238
Really?

108
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:57,559
Used to be a flight attendant.

109
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:02,207
Oh, boy.

110
00:06:02,369 --> 00:06:06,203
Why don't you open those pants.
It's gonna be a lot easier that way.

111
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:22,721
- So, what do you do?
- What?

112
00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:25,000
I said, what do you do?

113
00:06:25,209 --> 00:06:26,722
I don't know.

114
00:06:27,409 --> 00:06:29,798
- You don't know what you do?
- No.

115
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:31,721
Oh, come on.

116
00:06:32,529 --> 00:06:35,839
- You're very tense.
- Coffee. Too much coffee.

117
00:06:36,049 --> 00:06:38,609
Take off those pants.
I'll work the hamstring.

118
00:06:38,769 --> 00:06:41,158
Oh, the hamstring's fine.

119
00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:46,162
- But you wrote that it was tender.
- I wrote. I wrote.

120
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:48,362
I'll check it out.

121
00:06:49,129 --> 00:06:51,404
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Take them off.

122
00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:22,888
How did you hurt this?

123
00:07:23,049 --> 00:07:24,528
I don't know.

124
00:07:25,049 --> 00:07:26,926
- You don't know?
- No.

125
00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:28,761
- But you just told me.
- Korea.

126
00:07:29,329 --> 00:07:31,559
- You hurt it in Korea?
- What?

127
00:07:31,729 --> 00:07:34,118
- The hamstring.
- Korea.

128
00:07:34,769 --> 00:07:36,168
How?

129
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:37,887
Hamstring.

130
00:07:38,049 --> 00:07:40,279
How did you hurt the hamstring?

131
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:42,087
Hotel.

132
00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:50,885
How'd it go?

133
00:07:52,609 --> 00:07:54,167
George?

134
00:07:55,729 --> 00:07:59,165
No appointments at all?
Because my neck is still tight.

135
00:07:59,329 --> 00:08:01,001
What about Thursday?

136
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:02,761
And Friday?

137
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:06,759
Oh, boy. Okay. Thanks anyway.

138
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:12,761
What's with you?

139
00:08:14,209 --> 00:08:15,847
A...

140
00:08:16,489 --> 00:08:18,081
Yes. A...

141
00:08:18,369 --> 00:08:21,361
A man gave me...

142
00:08:22,689 --> 00:08:24,122
Yes. A man gave you...

143
00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:27,247
A man gave me...

144
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:30,481
...a massage.

145
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:33,163
- So?
- So he...

146
00:08:33,329 --> 00:08:36,082
...had his hands and...

147
00:08:36,369 --> 00:08:38,724
He was...

148
00:08:39,689 --> 00:08:43,398
- He was what?
- He- He was...

149
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:45,766
...touching and rubbing.

150
00:08:46,849 --> 00:08:48,202
That's a massage.

151
00:08:48,849 --> 00:08:51,079
- Then I took my pants off.
- You took your pants off?

152
00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:54,040
For my hamstring.

153
00:08:54,849 --> 00:08:56,521
He got about...

154
00:08:56,689 --> 00:08:58,725
...two inches from...

155
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:01,961
- ... there.
- Really?

156
00:09:03,289 --> 00:09:05,120
I think it moved.

157
00:09:07,169 --> 00:09:09,000
- It moved?
- It may have moved. I don't know.

158
00:09:10,169 --> 00:09:12,763
- I'm sure it didn't move.
- It moved!

159
00:09:12,929 --> 00:09:15,762
It was imperceptible, but I felt it.

160
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:18,682
Maybe it just wanted
to change positions. You know...

161
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:21,044
- ... shift to the other side.
- No, no.

162
00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:24,679
It wasn't a shift. I've shifted.
This was a move.

163
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:29,358
- Okay. So what if it moved?
- That's the sign, the test.

164
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:32,043
If a- If a man makes it move.

165
00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:34,769
That's not the test.
Contact is the test.

166
00:09:34,929 --> 00:09:38,365
If it moves as a result of contact.

167
00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:42,240
Do you think it's contact?
It has to be touched?

168
00:09:42,409 --> 00:09:44,684
That's what a gym teacher
once told me.

169
00:09:47,809 --> 00:09:49,481
- Hey.
- Hey.

170
00:09:49,649 --> 00:09:51,685
I just saw Joe DiMaggio
in Dinky Doughnuts.

171
00:09:52,689 --> 00:09:56,079
You know, I looked in there and there
he was having coffee and a doughnut.

172
00:09:56,249 --> 00:09:57,602
Joe DiMaggio?

173
00:09:57,769 --> 00:09:59,327
- In Dinky Doughnuts?
- Yes.

174
00:09:59,489 --> 00:10:01,639
- Joe DiMaggio.
- No. I'm sorry.

175
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:05,404
If Joe DiMaggio wants a doughnut,
he goes to a fancy restaurant.

176
00:10:05,569 --> 00:10:07,560
He's not sitting in Dinky Doughnuts.

177
00:10:07,729 --> 00:10:09,765
Well, maybe he likes
Dinky Doughnuts.

178
00:10:09,929 --> 00:10:11,885
I don't like to sit next
to men on airplanes...

179
00:10:12,049 --> 00:10:13,607
...because our knees might touch.

180
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:16,203
I can't see Joe DiMaggio
sitting at the counter...

181
00:10:16,369 --> 00:10:19,281
...at little, tiny, filthy,
smelly Dinky Doughnuts.

182
00:10:19,449 --> 00:10:21,838
Why can't he have a doughnut
like everybody else?

183
00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:25,524
He can have a doughnut,
but not a Dinky.

184
00:10:26,449 --> 00:10:29,646
I don't even like to use urinals.
Always been a stall man.

185
00:10:31,129 --> 00:10:32,881
Look, I'm telling-

186
00:10:34,609 --> 00:10:36,998
I'm telling you,
that was Joe DiMaggio.

187
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:41,966
The guy slept with Marilyn Monroe.
He's in Dinky Doughnuts.

188
00:10:42,129 --> 00:10:43,403
What about this doctor's note?

189
00:10:43,569 --> 00:10:45,639
- Let's go see Roy.
- I never said I'd do that.

190
00:10:45,809 --> 00:10:47,879
What are you talking about?
That's 75 bucks.

191
00:10:48,049 --> 00:10:50,040
I'm not working. I can't afford that.

192
00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:51,722
I don't know how I feel about it.

193
00:10:51,889 --> 00:10:54,278
Oh, what are you,
like a Quaker now?

194
00:10:55,409 --> 00:10:57,001
All right, all right.

195
00:10:57,169 --> 00:10:59,160
A stall man, huh?

196
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:04,921
So we were wondering if it was
possible for you to write us a note.

197
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:06,761
And if you can't,
believe me, it's fine.

198
00:11:06,929 --> 00:11:09,568
- He didn't say he can't.
- If you feel funny about it at all.

199
00:11:09,729 --> 00:11:11,242
- He doesn't feel funny.
- If he does.

200
00:11:11,409 --> 00:11:12,842
- Do you feel funny?
- Forget it.

201
00:11:13,009 --> 00:11:16,445
- He didn't say anything.
- He feels funny.

202
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:19,562
- You don't have to do this.
- He knows that!

203
00:11:19,729 --> 00:11:21,845
Should we go?
Is this a breach of our friendship?

204
00:11:22,009 --> 00:11:24,000
Oh, can you be any more dramatic?

205
00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:26,239
Don't be ridiculous.

206
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:31,168
Holyfield. He's a good friend
of one of my patients.

207
00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:33,081
He's got a hell of a body,
doesn't he?

208
00:11:33,249 --> 00:11:34,762
How would I know?

209
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:37,442
Do you like him?

210
00:11:37,809 --> 00:11:39,242
What do you mean, like him?

211
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:41,838
- Do you like him?
- Well, I mean, he's a good fighter...

212
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:44,364
...and a nice guy,
but I don't like him.

213
00:11:44,849 --> 00:11:47,204
- How come you don't like him?
- Why should I?

214
00:11:47,369 --> 00:11:49,485
- What is the matter with you?
- Nothing. Why?

215
00:11:49,649 --> 00:11:51,958
You think something's wrong?
Am I different?

216
00:11:52,409 --> 00:11:54,604
- So you want the notes?
- You don't have to, really.

217
00:11:54,769 --> 00:11:56,361
No, no. It's okay.

218
00:11:56,529 --> 00:11:59,680
We should probably get one
for Elaine too, right, George?

219
00:12:00,969 --> 00:12:02,118
George?

220
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:06,602
George.

221
00:12:09,009 --> 00:12:10,522
What about the week after?

222
00:12:13,369 --> 00:12:15,724
No appointments at all?

223
00:12:16,849 --> 00:12:18,407
What?

224
00:12:19,569 --> 00:12:21,048
Well, can I-?

225
00:12:21,209 --> 00:12:24,918
Can I at least just talk to her
so I can apologize?

226
00:12:25,889 --> 00:12:27,447
Forget it.

227
00:12:27,609 --> 00:12:31,443
I can't believe this.
I make one innocent comment...

228
00:12:31,609 --> 00:12:34,601
...about some lunatic in Pennsylvania,
and I'm cut off.

229
00:12:34,769 --> 00:12:37,158
This woman is insane.

230
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:39,600
What's with you?

231
00:12:40,169 --> 00:12:41,602
What?

232
00:12:41,889 --> 00:12:44,847
You were too close to me.
I was all scrunched in there.

233
00:12:45,169 --> 00:12:47,205
Hey, you scrunched me.

234
00:12:47,369 --> 00:12:49,803
I sat down here first.

235
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,202
Hey.

236
00:12:54,369 --> 00:12:57,167
I saw DiMaggio
in the doughnut shop again.

237
00:13:01,809 --> 00:13:03,561
- Yeah.
- Joe DiMaggio?

238
00:13:03,729 --> 00:13:06,721
Joe DiMaggio. This time I went in
and I sat down across from him...

239
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:08,288
...and I really watched him.

240
00:13:08,449 --> 00:13:10,599
I studied his every move.

241
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:13,966
For example, he dunks.

242
00:13:15,009 --> 00:13:17,364
- Joe DiMaggio dunks his doughnuts?
- That's right.

243
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:20,805
See, now I know it's not him.
Joe DiMaggio could not be a dunker.

244
00:13:20,969 --> 00:13:22,766
Oh, he's a dunker.

245
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:26,522
- Why couldn't he be a dunker?
- Nothing diverts his attention.

246
00:13:26,689 --> 00:13:29,442
Like, I'm sitting in there,
you know...

247
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:34,125
...and I start banging on the table
so that he'll look up.

248
00:13:34,289 --> 00:13:35,881
Like I'm sitting there, and I-

249
00:13:39,369 --> 00:13:43,408
He wouldn't move. So then I started
doing these yelping noises, like:

250
00:13:48,289 --> 00:13:52,248
No reaction, because the guy
is so focused, you see.

251
00:13:52,409 --> 00:13:55,287
He can just block out anything
that's going on around him.

252
00:13:55,449 --> 00:13:57,838
See, that's how he played baseball.

253
00:13:58,009 --> 00:14:00,364
He dunks like he hits.

254
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:02,121
- So then what?
- Well...

255
00:14:02,289 --> 00:14:05,042
...then the waitress, she comes up
and she tells me to shut up...

256
00:14:05,209 --> 00:14:07,006
...or they're gonna throw me out.

257
00:14:07,169 --> 00:14:09,808
Why didn't you just
call out his name?

258
00:14:14,569 --> 00:14:16,207
What happened to you?

259
00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:20,966
These kids called me a Mary.

260
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:23,723
A what?

261
00:14:23,889 --> 00:14:26,244
I was jumping over a puddle.

262
00:14:26,409 --> 00:14:29,606
For some reason, I went like this:

263
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:32,727
And they called me a Mary.

264
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:35,881
So I chased them
and I tripped and I fell.

265
00:14:36,049 --> 00:14:39,405
Yeah, you know kids.
They can be very perceptive.

266
00:14:40,049 --> 00:14:42,643
Hey, George. What is this?

267
00:14:42,809 --> 00:14:44,037
What is that?

268
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:46,325
No, really. What is that?

269
00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:52,442
Hello.

270
00:14:52,609 --> 00:14:54,440
Oh, hi, Roy.

271
00:14:54,609 --> 00:14:55,883
What?

272
00:14:56,209 --> 00:14:57,483
Oh, my God.

273
00:14:58,249 --> 00:15:00,205
How did this happen?

274
00:15:00,529 --> 00:15:02,406
What can I do?

275
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,003
I am so sorry.

276
00:15:06,289 --> 00:15:07,563
Okay.

277
00:15:07,729 --> 00:15:08,957
Bye.

278
00:15:09,129 --> 00:15:12,439
That was Roy. He's under
investigation for insurance fraud.

279
00:15:26,609 --> 00:15:28,201
- I told you.
- Told me what?

280
00:15:28,369 --> 00:15:30,883
- I told you we shouldn't do it.
- I didn't say anything.

281
00:15:31,049 --> 00:15:34,598
He's got a house, a family.
They could take away his license.

282
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:38,648
Three notes. How stupid was that?
We never should've got three notes.

283
00:15:38,809 --> 00:15:41,004
- Three notes?
- Yeah. You, me and George.

284
00:15:41,169 --> 00:15:42,568
- You got me a note?
- Yeah.

285
00:15:42,729 --> 00:15:44,287
- But I got my own note.
- You what?

286
00:15:44,449 --> 00:15:47,759
- I got a note from my gynecologist.
- Why'd you do that?

287
00:15:47,929 --> 00:15:50,762
- I didn't know you'd get me a note.
- Of course I'd get you a note.

288
00:15:50,929 --> 00:15:52,885
- You didn't say anything.
- Neither did you.

289
00:15:53,049 --> 00:15:55,961
That's how he got caught. We
sent in four notes from two doctors.

290
00:15:56,129 --> 00:15:58,438
How could you do that
to your friend?

291
00:15:59,689 --> 00:16:04,683
He's got a wife, kids
and a lot of other stuff.

292
00:16:04,849 --> 00:16:08,046
Oh, yeah.

293
00:16:12,609 --> 00:16:14,440
- Hi, Pam.
- Hello.

294
00:16:14,609 --> 00:16:16,167
Hello.

295
00:16:16,729 --> 00:16:19,402
I just thought maybe
I could talk to Roy if-

296
00:16:19,569 --> 00:16:22,527
Pam, did the x-ray
from Mrs. Sloane-?

297
00:16:22,689 --> 00:16:23,883
- Hi.
- Hi, Roy.

298
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:25,960
- How you doing?
- Come on back.

299
00:16:26,129 --> 00:16:28,040
I have a patient, but she's under.

300
00:16:28,849 --> 00:16:31,044
- I don't even know what to say.
- Me neither.

301
00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:33,962
- I knew this would happen.
- Me too.

302
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:38,245
I mean, the whole thing, it's just...

303
00:16:38,409 --> 00:16:40,798
- Tragic.
- Well, it's not tragic.

304
00:16:40,969 --> 00:16:42,925
- No?
- No. It's...

305
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:45,478
- Unsettling?
- Okay.

306
00:16:45,649 --> 00:16:49,528
- I mean, what if they-?
- I hope you're both happy.

307
00:16:52,489 --> 00:16:53,638
I'm not happy.

308
00:16:54,329 --> 00:16:57,480
Me, neither.
I've never been happy.

309
00:16:59,849 --> 00:17:02,761
I mean, I'm happy sometimes,
but not now.

310
00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:04,999
In college, maybe.

311
00:17:05,249 --> 00:17:08,685
- Those were fun times.
- Yeah, college was fun.

312
00:17:09,409 --> 00:17:12,765
You know the whole practice
is in jeopardy. You know that.

313
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:17,927
- Don't mind her.
- Oh, please. I love her.

314
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:20,683
I've just met her,
but I'm very impressed.

315
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:23,602
I've never had a problem
with these notes before.

316
00:17:23,769 --> 00:17:25,282
What's gonna happen now?

317
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:28,839
Nothing, as long as we get the physical
therapist to go along with our story.

318
00:17:29,009 --> 00:17:30,522
What? The physical therapist? Why?

319
00:17:30,689 --> 00:17:33,362
She has to say the complaint
was related to a dental problem.

320
00:17:37,729 --> 00:17:38,923
How you doing?

321
00:17:42,569 --> 00:17:44,525
Hi. Look, I know
I don't have an appointment...

322
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:47,203
...but it's really important
that I talk with Julianna.

323
00:17:47,369 --> 00:17:48,848
I'm sorry. She's not in.

324
00:17:49,009 --> 00:17:51,569
I know she's mad at me,
but I really have to speak with her.

325
00:17:51,729 --> 00:17:53,162
I told you she's not here.

326
00:17:53,329 --> 00:17:54,887
Look, you have to leave.

327
00:17:55,049 --> 00:17:56,482
Wait a second. Don't you-?

328
00:17:56,649 --> 00:17:58,765
Hi. Look,
I don't know what you think-

329
00:17:58,929 --> 00:18:00,362
- Please.
- But, you see...

330
00:18:00,529 --> 00:18:03,202
Let me talk to you for a second.
What I did is inadvertently-

331
00:18:03,369 --> 00:18:05,963
I treated you, so please
just get out of the office.

332
00:18:06,449 --> 00:18:07,723
Can't you listen to me?

333
00:18:07,889 --> 00:18:10,608
Run, Billy! Run to the office
and close the door.

334
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:12,038
Call the police.

335
00:18:12,889 --> 00:18:14,481
The police.

336
00:18:14,649 --> 00:18:15,968
What is the-?

337
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:17,642
Hi, George.

338
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:20,248
Hello.

339
00:18:21,329 --> 00:18:22,762
Raymond?

340
00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:29,162
Well, I mean,
it's only a six-month probation.

341
00:18:29,329 --> 00:18:30,762
It's a slap on the wrist.

342
00:18:30,929 --> 00:18:33,887
I still don't see any dinner invitations
forthcoming.

343
00:18:34,689 --> 00:18:36,998
Men have been popping
into my sexual fantasies.

344
00:18:39,249 --> 00:18:41,365
All of a sudden, I'll be in the middle.

345
00:18:42,409 --> 00:18:43,683
Of what?

346
00:18:46,729 --> 00:18:49,402
And a guy will appear
from out of nowhere.

347
00:18:49,569 --> 00:18:50,797
I said, "Get out of here.

348
00:18:50,969 --> 00:18:53,005
What do you want?
You don't belong here."

349
00:18:53,169 --> 00:18:55,888
- What do they do?
- They talk back.

350
00:18:56,049 --> 00:18:58,119
They go, "Hey, George,
how's it going?"

351
00:18:58,289 --> 00:19:00,678
I said, "Get the hell out of here."

352
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:02,840
Hey, it's the K-Man.

353
00:19:06,929 --> 00:19:08,840
Maybe it's time
you got a different hobby.

354
00:19:09,169 --> 00:19:11,558
Oh, man.

355
00:19:13,809 --> 00:19:15,959
Just came from Roy's.

356
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:18,288
I threw up from the gas.

357
00:19:22,449 --> 00:19:25,566
- Did he say anything?
- No, no. He's fine.

358
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:29,160
Oh, my God. It's...

359
00:19:29,329 --> 00:19:31,684
- What?
- Joe DiMaggio.

360
00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:34,364
Having a cup of coffee.

361
00:19:34,929 --> 00:19:36,999
- And he's dunking.
- Yeah.

362
00:19:38,729 --> 00:19:40,321
Look at him.

363
00:19:40,489 --> 00:19:42,923
The Yankee Clipper.

364
00:19:43,089 --> 00:19:44,363
Here.

365
00:19:44,569 --> 00:19:47,527
You see?
Now, that is a handsome man.

366
00:19:53,209 --> 00:19:54,437
Oh, please.

367
00:19:54,609 --> 00:19:56,725
Wait. Hold on a minute. Wait.

368
00:20:04,969 --> 00:20:06,687
See? I told you.

369
00:20:06,849 --> 00:20:08,202
What causes homophobia?

370
00:20:08,369 --> 00:20:12,760
What is it that makes
a heterosexual man worry?

371
00:20:12,969 --> 00:20:17,167
I think it's because men know
that deep down...

372
00:20:17,329 --> 00:20:19,399
...we have weak sales resistance.

373
00:20:19,809 --> 00:20:23,006
We're constantly buying shoes
that hurt us, pants that don't fit right.

374
00:20:23,449 --> 00:20:27,044
Men think, "Obviously,
I can be talked into anything.

375
00:20:27,249 --> 00:20:30,366
What if I accidentally wander
into some sort of homosexual store...

376
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:32,759
...thinking it's a shoe store,
and the salesman goes:

377
00:20:32,929 --> 00:20:36,888
'Just hold this guy's hand, walk
around the store. See how you feel.

378
00:20:37,489 --> 00:20:39,719
No obligation, no pressure,
just try it.

379
00:20:41,169 --> 00:20:43,399
Would you like to see him
in a sandal?"'

380
00:21:30,409 --> 00:21:32,400
