1
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:04,220
Most men like working on things.

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,950
Tools, objects, fixing things.
This is what men enjoy doing.

3
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:13,710
Ever noticed if a guy's in his driveway
working on something with tools...

4
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:15,900
...how all the other men
in the neighbourhood...

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,610
...are magnetically drawn
to this activity?

6
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:22,260
They just come wandering out
of the house like zombies.

7
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:28,000
Men... It's true. Men hear a drill,
it's like a dog whistle. Just:

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,170
They go running up
to the living-room curtain.

9
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:35,920
"Honey, I think Jim's working
on something over there."

10
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,010
So they run over to the guy.

11
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,890
They don't actually help the guy.

12
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:44,370
No. They just want to hang
around the area...

13
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,920
...where work is being done.

14
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,880
That's what men want to do.

15
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:54,380
We want to watch the guy.
We want to talk to him.

16
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:57,410
We want to ask him dumb questions.
You know...

17
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,690
"What are you using,
a Phillips head?"

18
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,920
You know, we feel involved.

19
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:07,210
That's why when they have
construction sites...

20
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,820
...they have to have those wood
panel fences around it.

21
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:12,740
That's just to keep the men out.

22
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,620
They cut those little holes for us...

23
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:17,430
...so we can see
what the hell is going on.

24
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:21,500
But if they don't cut those holes,
we are climbing those fences.

25
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:25,470
Right over there. "What are you using,
the steel girders down here?"

26
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,010
Yeah, that'll hold.

27
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,410
I had to say something.

28
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,490
Had to say something.

29
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,410
Everything was going so well.
I had to say something.

30
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,190
I don't think you did
anything wrong.

31
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,940
I told her I liked her. Why?

32
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,710
Why did I tell her I like her?

33
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:00,090
I have this sick compulsion
to tell women how I feel.

34
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,080
I like you. I don't tell you.

35
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,270
We can only thank God for that.

36
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,650
I'm out of the picture.
I am out of the picture.

37
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,050
Matter of time now.

38
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,220
- You're imagining this. Really.
- Oh, no. No, no.

39
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,120
I'll tell you when it happened too.

40
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:24,290
It's when that floss came
flying out of my pocket.

41
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,480
What floss? When?

42
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,780
In the lobby, during
the intermission of the play.

43
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,490
I was buying her one of those
containers of orange drink.

44
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,470
For $5.

45
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,560
I reach into my pocket
to pay for it. I look down.

46
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,680
There's this piece of green floss
hanging from my fingers.

47
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,610
- Mint.
- Of course.

48
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:45,990
So I'm looking at it.
I look up and see she's looking at it.

49
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,970
Our eyes lock.

50
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,310
It was a horrible moment. I just...

51
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,040
So let me get this straight.
She saw the floss.

52
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,270
You panicked, and you told her
you liked her.

53
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,150
If I didn't put floss in my pocket...

54
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,430
...l'd be crawling around her bedroom
right now, looking for my glasses.

55
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,700
- You sure the floss was the catalyst?
- Yes, I am.

56
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:14,040
You don't think it might have
had anything to do with that?

57
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,440
What, you don't like this?

58
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,670
Looks like your belt is digesting
a small animal.

59
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:25,620
They got a cure for cancer.
See, it's all big business.

60
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,750
Oh, hey! Jerry just walked in.

61
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,630
Hi, George!

62
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,650
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Take my number.

63
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:38,450
It's 555-8643.

64
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,640
Okay. Here he is.

65
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,040
- Who is it?
- Take it.

66
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,690
- Who is it?
- It's for you.

67
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,610
Hello?

68
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,430
Oh, hi, Joel.

69
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,550
No. I was out of town.
I just got back.

70
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:59,100
Kramer doesn't know anything.
He's just my next-door neighbour.

71
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,330
Nothing much. Tuesday?

72
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:07,030
Tuesday, no.
I'm meeting somebody.

73
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,740
Wednesday?

74
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:13,910
Wednesday's okay. All right.

75
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,730
I'm a little busy right now.
Can we talk Wednesday morning?

76
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,500
Okay. Yeah.

77
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:21,320
Right. Thanks. Bye.

78
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,510
Why do you put me
on the phone with him?

79
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,910
I hate just being handed a phone.

80
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:28,300
Well, it's your phone.
He wanted to talk to you.

81
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,490
Maybe I didn't want to talk to him.

82
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,580
- Well, why not?
- He bothers me.

83
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,880
I don't answer the phone anymore
because of him.

84
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,480
He's turned me into a screener.

85
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,510
Now I gotta see him on Wednesday.

86
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:43,220
What? I thought we had tickets
to the Knick game Wednesday.

87
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,780
We got seats behind the bench.

88
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,390
- What happened? We're not going?
- We're going.

89
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,580
That's next Wednesday.

90
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,960
- Who is this guy?
- His name's Joel Horneck.

91
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,780
He lived, like, three houses down
from me when I grew up.

92
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:00,010
He had a Ping-Pong table.
We were friends.

93
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,600
Should I suffer the rest of my life
because I like to play Ping-Pong?

94
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,000
I was 10!

95
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:10,750
I would've been friends with Stalin
if he had a Ping-Pong table.

96
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,600
He's so self-involved.

97
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,020
That's for me.

98
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,420
Kramerica Industries.

99
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,400
Hi, Mark.

100
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,050
No, no. Forget that.
I got a better idea.

101
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,240
A pizza place where you make
your own pie.

102
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:34,120
Can you conduct your business...

103
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,870
...elsewhere?
- No, I'm talking about a whole chain.

104
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,060
Yeah.

105
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,280
I don't know why you bother
with this Ping-Pong guy, I tell you.

106
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,630
I don't bother with him.

107
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,870
He's been calling me for seven years.
I never called him once.

108
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,680
He's got the attention span
of a 5-year-old.

109
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,350
Sometimes I sit there...

110
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,380
...and I make up things just to see
if he's paying attention.

111
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,980
I don't understand why
you spend time with this guy.

112
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,380
What can I do, break up with him?

113
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:05,720
Tell him, " I don't think we're right
for each other."

114
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,700
It's a guy.

115
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,890
At least with a woman
there's a precedent.

116
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,080
The relationship goes sour,
you end it.

117
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:16,570
No, no, no. You have to approach
this as if he was a woman.

118
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,180
- Just break up with him?
- Absolutely.

119
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,510
- You just tell him the truth.
- The truth?

120
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:29,610
No. As a guy, I don't know how
I can break up with another guy.

121
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:31,690
You know?
I don't know how to say:

122
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,610
"Bill, I feel I need to see other men."

123
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,320
Know what I mean?
There is nothing I can do.

124
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,830
I have to wait for someone to die.

125
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,960
I think that's the only way
out of this relationship.

126
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,420
It could be a long time.

127
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:48,800
See the great thing about guys
is that we can become friends...

128
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,090
...based on almost nothing.

129
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,580
Just two guys will just become friends
just because they're two guys.

130
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,390
That's almost all we need
to have in common.

131
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,360
Because sports and women
is really all we talk about.

132
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,590
If there was no sports and no women,
the only thing guys would say is:

133
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,990
"So, what's in the refrigerator?"

134
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,980
So my shrink wants me to bring
my mother in for a session.

135
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,060
I mean, this guy is a brilliant man.

136
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,840
Lenny Bruce used to go to him...

137
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,670
...and I think, Geraldo.

138
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,670
I read the Lenny Bruce biography.
I thought it was...

139
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,450
Hey, hey, hey! We're starving here!

140
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,050
...interesting...
- We've been waiting here 10 minutes.

141
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,720
...that he would...

142
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,420
So I'm thinking about going
to Iran this summer.

143
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,500
You know, I have to eat.

144
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,180
I mean, I'm hypoglycaemic.

145
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:49,450
Anyway, the Hezbollah
has invited me to perform.

146
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:58,110
- It's their annual terrorist luncheon.
- Yeah.

147
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,610
I'm gonna do it in Farsi.

148
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,530
Do you think I need a haircut?

149
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,100
Are you ready?

150
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,710
Yeah, I'll have the egg salad
on whole wheat.

151
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,360
Hey, let me ask you a question.
This turkey sandwich here...

152
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,550
...is that real turkey
or is it a turkey roll?

153
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,430
I don't want that processed turkey.

154
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,410
I hate it.

155
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,970
I think it's real turkey.

156
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:23,140
- Is there a real bird in the back?
- No, there's no bird, but...

157
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,960
How do you know for sure?
Why don't you do me a favour.

158
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:29,300
Why don't you go in the back
and find out, okay?

159
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,360
Unbelievable.

160
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,000
How can you talk
to someone like that?

161
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:42,860
Look, what are you saying?
What, you like turkey roll?

162
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,340
Listen, Joel. There's something
I have to tell you.

163
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,640
Wait.

164
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,350
You'll never guess who I ran into.

165
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,850
- Howard Metro.
- Howard Metro.

166
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:58,190
He asked me if I still saw you.
I said, "Sure, I see him all the time.

167
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:02,570
We're still great friends."
Anyway, Howard says hello.

168
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,370
Listen, Joel.

169
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,810
I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

170
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,420
What?

171
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:16,130
This friendship, it's not working.

172
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,320
Not working?
What are you talking about?

173
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,180
We're just not suited to be friends.

174
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:25,310
- But how can you say that?
- Look, you're a nice guy.

175
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:28,020
It's just that we don't have
anything in common.

176
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,100
Wait. What did I do?

177
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,400
Tell me what...
I want to know what I did.

178
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:36,050
You didn't do anything.
It's not you. It's me.

179
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:38,970
It's... This is very difficult.

180
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,890
Look, I know I call you too much.
Right? I mean, I know.

181
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,910
- You're a very busy guy.
- No, it's not that.

182
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:49,090
You're one of the few people
I can talk to.

183
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,800
Look, come on.
Now, that's not true.

184
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,880
I always tell everybody about you.

185
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:56,910
I tell everybody to go see his show!

186
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,290
I mean, I'm your biggest fan.

187
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,900
- I know, I know.
- I mean, you're my best friend.

188
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,030
Best friend? I've never been
to your apartment.

189
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,950
I cannot believe that this
is happening! I can't believe it.

190
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:13,600
Okay, okay, forget it.
It's okay. I didn't mean it.

191
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,580
- Didn't mean what?
- What I said.

192
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,130
- I've been under a lot of stress.
- Oh, you've been under a lot of stress.

193
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:24,030
Look, just... Can we just forget
the whole thing ever happened?

194
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,530
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.
I took it out on you.

195
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:30,600
We're still friends.
We're still friends. Still friends.

196
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:36,130
Okay, look. I tell you what.
I got Knick tickets. This Wednesday.

197
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:38,730
Great seats behind the bench.
You want to come with me?

198
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,610
Come on.

199
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,180
Tonight?

200
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:46,140
No, next Wednesday. If it was tonight,
I would've said tonight.

201
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,210
You really want me to go?

202
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:53,540
Yes.

203
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,700
- Okay.
- Here, take these.

204
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,140
Okay. Great. That would be...

205
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,750
That'd be great. So...

206
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,940
...next Wednesday.
- Next Wednesday.

207
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,900
Say, where is that waitress? Hey!

208
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:32,550
She calls me up at the office.
She says, "We have to talk."

209
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:36,830
The four worst words
in the English language.

210
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,690
That or, "Whose bra is this?"

211
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,520
That is worse.

212
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,920
So we order lunch,
and we're talking.

213
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,110
Finally, she blurts out
how it's not working.

214
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,470
Really.

215
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:51,590
So, I'm thinking, as she's saying this,
I'm thinking, "Great.

216
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,510
The relationship's over,
but the egg salad's on the way."

217
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:57,640
So now I have a decision.
Do I walk or do I eat?

218
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,730
You ate.

219
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,960
Sat there for 20 minutes, chewing.

220
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:05,990
Staring at each other
in a defunct relationship.

221
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,910
Someone says,
"Get out of my life."

222
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,620
And that doesn't affect
your appetite?

223
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,500
Have you ever had
their egg salad?

224
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:16,420
- It is unbelievable.
- It's unbelievable.

225
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:19,230
Tell you what else is unbelievable.
I picked up the check.

226
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,630
She didn't even offer.
She ended it.

227
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,870
The least she could do is
send me off with a sandwich.

228
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,730
How much could you
possibly have in there?

229
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:30,390
Look, it's my money.

230
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,900
All right? What should I do,
throw it out the window?

231
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,610
I know a guy who took
his vacation on his change.

232
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,900
Yeah? Where'd he go?
To an arcade?

233
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:41,030
That's funny. You're a funny guy.

234
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,430
Come on, move up.

235
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,200
Great. Ewing's hurt.

236
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:46,660
How long is he gonna be out?

237
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:50,000
Well, a couple days
at the most, but...

238
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,300
- Oh, God.
- I got scared there for a second.

239
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,650
The Knicks without Ewing.

240
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,680
Listen, George.
A little problem with the game.

241
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,760
- What about it?
- The thing is, yesterday...

242
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:01,270
...I kind of...

243
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:06,790
- What?
- I gave your ticket to Horneck.

244
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,410
- You what?
- Yeah.

245
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,120
I'm sorry.
I had to give it to Horneck.

246
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,150
No.

247
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,260
My ticket?

248
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,180
- You gave my ticket to Horneck?
- Come on. Go ahead. Move up.

249
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,850
What did you give him
my ticket for?

250
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:31,720
You didn't see him.
It was horrible.

251
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:34,120
Oh, come on, Jerry.
I can't believe this!

252
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,000
- I had to do it.
- Oh, please.

253
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:38,710
Can you change this into bills?

254
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,690
I'm sorry, sir, we can't do that.

255
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,360
Do you want to go with him?

256
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,660
- You go, I don't mind.
- I'm not going with him!

257
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,430
I don't even know the guy!

258
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,410
Look, they did this for me before.

259
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,540
Look, I can give you these,
and you can roll them yourself.

260
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,250
You want me to roll 6000 of these?

261
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,860
What, should I quit my job?

262
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:00,300
No, I do not like the bank.
I've heard the expression:

263
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:03,850
"Laughing all the way to the bank."
I've never seen anyone actually do it.

264
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,390
And those bank lines.

265
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,310
I hate it when there's
nobody on the line at all.

266
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,820
You now that part?
You go to the bank, it's empty...

267
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:16,050
...and you still have to go
through the little maze.

268
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,280
"Could you get some cheese for me?
I'm almost at the front.

269
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:22,200
I'd like a reward for this, please."

270
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,710
- Thirty-two, 33...
- George.

271
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,150
Not now, 33...

272
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,280
- Thirty...
- Could you stop the counting?

273
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,220
- What?
- Can I make it up to you?

274
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:38,790
I'll give you $50 for the jug.

275
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:40,870
Oh, yeah, sure. Keep your money.

276
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,060
Well, then I'm not gonna go
to the game either.

277
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:45,780
Okay, I'll give him both tickets.

278
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,070
Go. Go!

279
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,270
l... No, I don't want to go.

280
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,710
- He was really crying?
- I had to give him a tissue.

281
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,940
In fact, let me call his machine now,
and I'll make up some excuse...

282
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,550
...why I can't go to the game either.

283
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,780
Wait. Wait a minute. As long
as you're gonna lie to the guy...

284
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:11,850
...why don't you tell him that you lost
both of the tickets. Then we can go.

285
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,250
George, the man wept.

286
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:17,170
Hey, guys.

287
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:21,130
Man, I'm telling you, this pizza idea
is really gonna happen.

288
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:26,870
This is the thing where you go and
you have to make your own pizza?

289
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:28,230
We give you the dough.

290
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:31,770
You smash it. You pound it.
You fling it up in the air.

291
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,800
And then you get to put your sauce
and sprinkle your cheese.

292
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,550
And then,
you slide it into the oven.

293
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,520
You have to know how to do that.

294
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:46,270
You can't have people shoving
their arms into a 600-degree oven!

295
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,190
- It's all supervised.
- Oh, well...

296
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,860
All of it!

297
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:54,200
- You want to invest?
- My money's tied up in change.

298
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,970
You know, look. I'm telling you.

299
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,990
People, they really want to make
their own pizza pie.

300
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,440
I have to say something,
with all due respect.

301
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:05,670
I just never...
I can't imagine anyone...

302
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,590
...in any walk of life,
under any circumstance...

303
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,510
...wanting to make
their own pizza pie.

304
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,700
- But that's me.
- Well, okay.

305
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,890
- That's you.
- I'm just saying.

306
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,230
I just wanted to check with you guys.
This business is going to be big.

307
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,310
I just want to... Okay.

308
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:28,410
One day, you'll beg me
to make your own pie.

309
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:37,380
Hi, Joel. This is Jerry.
I hope you get this before you...

310
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,880
Oh, hi, Joel. Oh, you just came in.

311
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:44,680
Listen, I can't make it
to the game tonight.

312
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:47,080
I have to tutor my nephew.

313
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:49,890
Yeah, he's got an exam tomorrow.

314
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,080
Geometry.

315
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:54,800
You know, trapezoid, rhombus.

316
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,760
Anyway, listen, you take the tickets.
They're at the will-call window.

317
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:03,770
And I'm really sorry. Have a good time.
We'll talk next week, okay? Yeah.

318
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:06,370
Yeah. I don't... Fine.

319
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,350
Fine, bye.

320
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:11,800
"Trapezoid"?

321
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,930
I know. I'm really running out
of excuses with this guy.

322
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:17,640
I need some kind of excuse Rolodex.

323
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:27,650
Come on. Let's go do something.
I don't want to just sit around here.

324
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,530
- Wanna get something to eat?
- Where?

325
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,820
I don't care. I'm not hungry.

326
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,260
We could go to one of those
cappuccino places.

327
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:37,250
They let you just sit there.

328
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:39,540
What are we gonna do there, talk?

329
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:42,360
We can talk.

330
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,340
I'll go if I don't have to talk.

331
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,880
Then we'll just sit there.

332
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:51,220
Okay, I'm gonna check
my machine first.

333
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:58,310
"Picking someone up
at airport, jury duty...

334
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:02,490
...waiting for cable company."
- Okay, just hand that over, please.

335
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,990
- What is this?
- It's a list of excuses.

336
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,270
It's for that guy Horneck, who's
at the game tonight with my tickets.

337
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:13,120
I have that list now, so in case
he calls, I just consult it...

338
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,000
...and I don't have to see him.

339
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,590
- God.
- I need it.

340
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:23,350
- What are you doing?
- I got some for you.

341
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,850
- Oh, I don't need any more.
- No, no, no.

342
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:28,040
These are good. Listen, listen.

343
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,060
"You ran out of underwear,
you can't leave the house."

344
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,250
Very funny.

345
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,590
How about you've been diagnosed...

346
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,560
...as a multiple personality?
You're not even you.

347
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,640
You're Dan.

348
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm Dan.

349
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:48,590
- Can I have my list back, please?
- Here. Here.

350
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:52,030
Jerry Seinfeld, I cannot
believe you are doing this.

351
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,220
This is absolutely infantile.

352
00:18:56,930 --> 00:19:00,580
- What can I do?
- Deal with it. Be a man.

353
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,250
Oh, no.

354
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:07,880
That's impossible. I'd rather
lie to him the rest of my life...

355
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:09,860
...than go through that again.

356
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,320
He was crying.

357
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:15,180
Tears, accompanied by mucus.

358
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,100
You made a man cry?

359
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,400
I never made a man cry.

360
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:24,470
I even kicked a guy in the groin once,
and he didn't cry.

361
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,550
I got the cab.

362
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,930
A couple of tough monkeys.

363
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,210
Hi, Elaine.

364
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,980
Hey, you missed
a great game tonight.

365
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,440
- Game?
- Knick game.

366
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:41,780
Horneck took me. We're sitting
two rows behind the bench.

367
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:44,180
We were getting hit by sweat!

368
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,620
Wait. How does Horneck know you?

369
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:50,330
Last week, when I, you know,
gave you the phone.

370
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,210
He's really into my pizza place idea.

371
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,820
- This is too much.
- Wait. What pizza place idea?

372
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,800
Oh, no.

373
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:58,890
You get to make your own pie.

374
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:03,270
That sounds like a great idea.
It would be fun.

375
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,140
- Kramer!
- Yeah!

376
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,810
Perfect.

377
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,380
Hey!

378
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,030
Okay, who wants meat loaf?

379
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,220
- No, thanks.
- No, no.

380
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,410
It's gonna be hot in a minute.

381
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:19,640
So I thought you were
tutoring your nephew.

382
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:23,080
- We finished early.
- I'll bet.

383
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:27,460
So are you going to introduce me
to your nephew?

384
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:30,490
Elaine Benes, this is Joel Horneck.

385
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,200
Whoa, Nelson.

386
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:35,600
This is Elaine.

387
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:39,150
- I thought you guys split up.
- We're still friends.

388
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,540
So...

389
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:45,090
Thanks again for those tickets,
But next week, I'm gonna take you.

390
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,700
How about next Tuesday night?
Why don't you come along.

391
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:53,430
Oh, no, no. Tuesday's no good
because we've got choir practice.

392
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,420
Right.

393
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,400
- Forgot about choir.
- Yeah.

394
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,800
We're... We're doing that evening...

395
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,300
...of Eastern European
national anthems.

396
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,760
Right. You know...

397
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:06,470
...the wall being down and everything.

398
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:11,060
Well, what about Thursday night?
I mean, they're playing the Sonics.

399
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,900
Thursday is not good because
we've gotta get to the hospital...

400
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:20,450
...to see if we qualify
as those organ donors.

401
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,430
I should really try
something like that.

402
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,450
You really should.

403
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,900
Well, let's just take a look here.

404
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,670
Forty-one home games.

405
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:33,070
Let's see, Saturday night
we got the Mavericks.

406
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,680
If you don't like the Mavericks,
next Tuesday, Lakers.

407
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,450
I mean, you gotta like Magic, right?

408
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:40,270
Now, let's see. On the road,
on the road, on the road...

409
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:42,350
Back, back on the 14th.

410
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:45,690
They play the Bulls.
You can't miss Air Jordan...

411
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:49,860
I've come to the conclusion that there
are certain friends in your life...

412
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:53,090
...that they're just always your friends,
and you have to accept it.

413
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:56,120
You see them. You don't want
to see them. You don't call them.

414
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:57,890
They call you.

415
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,290
You don't call back,
they call again.

416
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,730
The way to get through talking
with people...

417
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,510
...you have nothing in common with...

418
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:08,430
...is to pretend you're hosting
your own little talk show.

419
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,350
This is what I do. Pretend there's
a little desk around you.

420
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:15,100
There's a little chair over there,
and you interview them.

421
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,190
The only problem is,
there's no way to say:

422
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,320
"Hey, it's been great having
you on the show.

423
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:21,780
We're out of time."
