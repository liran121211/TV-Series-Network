1
00:00:02,317 --> 00:00:04,069
I was thinking about the wig
historically.</i>

2
00:00:05,597 --> 00:00:07,952
The Revolutionary War
was the last war fought in wigs...</i>

3
00:00:08,117 --> 00:00:11,314
...and it seems like that must have
been hard. They're going into battle:</i>

4
00:00:11,477 --> 00:00:14,071
"Well, do I have my bullets?
Do I have my bobby pins?"</i>

5
00:00:14,237 --> 00:00:17,035
You gotta make sure you have
everything. Lot more to worry about.</i>

6
00:00:17,197 --> 00:00:20,155
"What if I get killed?
Is my wig on straight?"</i>

7
00:00:21,037 --> 00:00:24,154
I don't know when the whole wig thing
came into style for a man...</i>

8
00:00:24,317 --> 00:00:25,750
...but I know when it went out:</i>

9
00:00:25,917 --> 00:00:28,511
When the mirror was invented.</i>

10
00:00:28,677 --> 00:00:30,235
No guy is looking in a mirror...

11
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:33,355
...powdering a thatch of horsehair
on his head, going:</i>

12
00:00:33,517 --> 00:00:37,351
"All right, let's go
rap to the ladies."</i>

13
00:00:40,077 --> 00:00:43,035
- I'm looking for a crested blazer.
- A crested blazer.</i>

14
00:00:43,197 --> 00:00:46,553
I wore one once, and I really think
it did something for me.</i>

15
00:00:46,717 --> 00:00:48,469
Yes, I think we might
have something.</i>

16
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:52,950
The Joseph Abboud crested blazer
is the finest.</i>

17
00:00:53,117 --> 00:00:55,551
That's hand ticking
around the crest...</i>

18
00:00:55,717 --> 00:00:59,187
...and these are the world-famous
corisso buttons...</i>

19
00:00:59,357 --> 00:01:01,109
...made from
the finest antelope horn.</i>

20
00:01:02,237 --> 00:01:04,387
Then they'll match my sneakers.</i>

21
00:01:06,477 --> 00:01:09,355
It looks fabulous on you.
Shall I wrap it up?

22
00:01:09,517 --> 00:01:12,190
You know, I'm not sure.</i>

23
00:01:12,357 --> 00:01:13,836
I'll tell you what.</i>

24
00:01:13,997 --> 00:01:16,875
I'll come back later with someone,
see what they think.</i>

25
00:01:20,877 --> 00:01:24,074
- Really, I'll be back.
- Yeah.</i>

26
00:01:24,837 --> 00:01:28,307
So I didn't like the crest all that much,
but the guy spent 15 minutes with me.</i>

27
00:01:28,477 --> 00:01:31,833
To get out of the store, I said I wanted
to see what someone else thought.</i>

28
00:01:31,997 --> 00:01:34,272
Then he makes a face
like he doesn't believe me.</i>

29
00:01:34,437 --> 00:01:36,029
So he knew
you were making it up?</i>

30
00:01:36,197 --> 00:01:37,232
Yeah, he caught me.</i>

31
00:01:37,877 --> 00:01:39,276
So here's what I want you to do.</i>

32
00:01:39,437 --> 00:01:42,270
Come with me to the store,
and we'll pretend to look at the coat.</i>

33
00:01:42,677 --> 00:01:43,905
That's ridiculous.

34
00:01:44,077 --> 00:01:45,988
Why go back there
if you don't want the coat?</i>

35
00:01:46,317 --> 00:01:49,753
Because he thinks I was lying.
I wanna show him I wasn't.</i>

36
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:51,271
But you were.</i>

37
00:01:51,437 --> 00:01:54,395
But if you go back with me,
then I'm not.</i>

38
00:01:54,917 --> 00:01:56,794
All right, fine. Whatever.</i>

39
00:01:57,637 --> 00:01:59,275
Problems with the houseguest?</i>

40
00:01:59,437 --> 00:02:00,631
What houseguest?</i>

41
00:02:00,797 --> 00:02:03,550
This friend of Susan's
is staying with us for two weeks.</i>

42
00:02:03,717 --> 00:02:05,628
Now, am I wrong,
or is that excessive?</i>

43
00:02:06,517 --> 00:02:10,271
Well, Bob Sacamano, he stayed
with me once for a year and a half.</i>

44
00:02:10,877 --> 00:02:13,152
- Who is he?
- He's a wig master.</i>

45
00:02:14,157 --> 00:02:16,796
- What is a wig master?
- He's with the touring company...</i>

46
00:02:16,957 --> 00:02:19,551
...of Joseph and the Amazing
Technicolor Dreamcoat.</i>

47
00:02:19,717 --> 00:02:21,355
He's the guy in charge of the wigs.</i>

48
00:02:22,037 --> 00:02:26,474
Boy, imagine liking wigs to the point
it becomes a career choice.</i>

49
00:02:26,637 --> 00:02:29,390
So how about some tickets, George?
You know, I'd kill for a peek.</i>

50
00:02:29,557 --> 00:02:32,515
Yeah, yeah. Sure, sure, sure.
I gotta drop my car off at the new lot.</i>

51
00:02:32,677 --> 00:02:35,032
- What lot's that?
- Jiffy Park. It's incredible.</i>

52
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:36,516
Seventy-five dollars a month.</i>

53
00:02:36,677 --> 00:02:38,235
Seventy-five bucks a month?</i>

54
00:02:38,397 --> 00:02:40,194
You get this cool T-shirt
when you sign up.</i>

55
00:02:40,357 --> 00:02:41,426
Oh, I'm down.

56
00:02:42,757 --> 00:02:45,829
Remember me? I said I'd come back
with someone, and I did.</i>

57
00:02:46,597 --> 00:02:48,827
- Surprised?
- No, I believed you.</i>

58
00:02:49,037 --> 00:02:50,629
This is Elaine.</i>

59
00:02:50,797 --> 00:02:53,265
Oh, hello. I'm Craig.</i>

60
00:02:53,437 --> 00:02:54,870
Oh, hi.

61
00:02:55,317 --> 00:02:58,753
Well, here it is.</i>

62
00:03:00,637 --> 00:03:02,753
Joseph Abboud.</i>

63
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:05,670
And look at this hand ticking
around the crest.</i>

64
00:03:05,837 --> 00:03:07,270
You know your clothes.</i>

65
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:10,713
Well, I'm in the biz.
I work for J. Peterman.</i>

66
00:03:10,877 --> 00:03:14,233
I love J. Peterman.
I especially enjoy the catalog.</i>

67
00:03:14,397 --> 00:03:16,513
Those fanciful narratives
really take me away.</i>

68
00:03:16,677 --> 00:03:17,826
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.</i>

69
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:19,476
- You know what? I write those.
- No.</i>

70
00:03:19,637 --> 00:03:22,709
Elaine, what about the crest?
What do you think of the crest here?</i>

71
00:03:22,877 --> 00:03:24,469
Well, I love it.</i>

72
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:26,150
- You what?
- I think it's great.</i>

73
00:03:26,317 --> 00:03:29,070
- I think you should get it.
- Well...</i>

74
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:34,394
- Will it be check or credit card?
- Check.</i>

75
00:03:35,117 --> 00:03:38,029
I'll need you to write down your
phone number on the check for me.</i>

76
00:03:38,197 --> 00:03:39,835
Perhaps you could do the same.</i>

77
00:03:45,957 --> 00:03:47,356
You weren't supposed to say that.</i>

78
00:03:47,517 --> 00:03:49,712
- But I really did like it.
- That's not the point.</i>

79
00:03:49,877 --> 00:03:52,437
You put me in a position
where I had no choice.</i>

80
00:03:52,597 --> 00:03:53,632
Sorry.

81
00:03:53,917 --> 00:03:56,431
What about that guy
asking you out right in front of me?</i>

82
00:03:56,597 --> 00:03:58,508
What is the big deal?</i>

83
00:03:58,677 --> 00:04:01,794
It was very emasculating. He doesn't
know the nature of our relationship.</i>

84
00:04:01,957 --> 00:04:05,188
You're there approving new clothes.
That's a girlfriend job.</i>

85
00:04:05,357 --> 00:04:06,551
How dare he?</i>

86
00:04:06,717 --> 00:04:08,628
He dared.</i>

87
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:16,476
Hi, George. How was your day?</i>

88
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:19,193
Good. Good day.

89
00:04:19,997 --> 00:04:23,273
- You?
- I am getting so much work done.</i>

90
00:04:23,437 --> 00:04:26,474
- See?
- Very nice.</i>

91
00:04:26,637 --> 00:04:28,548
Hey, sweetie, how was your day?</i>

92
00:04:28,717 --> 00:04:30,947
I already asked him that.
He said, "Good. Good day."</i>

93
00:04:39,397 --> 00:04:41,035
Thank God you're home.
I'm locked out.</i>

94
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:42,789
I dropped my car at Jiffy Park...</i>

95
00:04:42,957 --> 00:04:45,266
...and I forgot to take
my apartment key off the ring.</i>

96
00:04:45,437 --> 00:04:48,873
- So you got my spare?
- No, I gave it back to you.</i>

97
00:04:49,037 --> 00:04:50,186
You did?

98
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:52,666
Well, look,
can you take me over there?</i>

99
00:04:52,837 --> 00:04:54,236
- Oh, come on.
- Oh, come on, Jerry.</i>

100
00:04:54,397 --> 00:04:57,469
- It's all the way over to 12th Avenue.
- I didn't tell you to park there.</i>

101
00:04:57,637 --> 00:05:00,197
Now someone's gotta drive you
every time you need your car?</i>

102
00:05:00,357 --> 00:05:02,712
- Take the bus.
- I'm not gonna take the bus.</i>

103
00:05:02,877 --> 00:05:04,833
That's why I got a car.

104
00:05:05,437 --> 00:05:07,826
- Forget it.
- I'm gonna get George to pick me up.</i>

105
00:05:07,997 --> 00:05:09,749
He won't take you.</i>

106
00:05:11,997 --> 00:05:14,557
Got it, got it. Hello?</i>

107
00:05:14,717 --> 00:05:16,230
Can you take me over to Jiffy Park?</i>

108
00:05:16,397 --> 00:05:19,992
Yeah, I'll pick you up right now.
All right. Okay. Gotta go.</i>

109
00:05:24,237 --> 00:05:25,795
So the wig mas-</i>

110
00:05:25,957 --> 00:05:28,551
The wig master said
you could stop by the theater tonight...</i>

111
00:05:28,717 --> 00:05:30,594
...and he'll show you around.</i>

112
00:05:31,237 --> 00:05:32,716
Would you pick a station!

113
00:05:32,877 --> 00:05:35,266
I like them all.</i>

114
00:05:38,117 --> 00:05:39,266
Oh, great.</i>

115
00:05:39,437 --> 00:05:41,826
Now the volume knob fell off.</i>

116
00:05:44,837 --> 00:05:45,986
What's this?

117
00:05:46,157 --> 00:05:48,466
- Oh, God.
- What?

118
00:05:48,637 --> 00:05:50,116
It's a c-

119
00:05:50,277 --> 00:05:52,552
It's a condom!

120
00:05:55,757 --> 00:05:58,476
How do you like working there
at The Andover Shop?</i>

121
00:05:58,637 --> 00:06:01,868
I mean, it's pretty swanky.
Upscale clientele.</i>

122
00:06:02,037 --> 00:06:03,914
Except for Jerry.</i>

123
00:06:06,077 --> 00:06:07,908
So did you see anything you liked?</i>

124
00:06:09,277 --> 00:06:11,188
Because I can get you
a considerable discount.</i>

125
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:13,593
Really? Well, actually,
yeah, I did see...</i>

126
00:06:13,757 --> 00:06:17,466
...this amazing little black dress.
It was sleeveless.</i>

127
00:06:17,637 --> 00:06:19,434
- The Nicole Miller.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

128
00:06:19,597 --> 00:06:21,428
- I'll take care of it.
- Really?</i>

129
00:06:21,597 --> 00:06:22,791
But I barely know you.</i>

130
00:06:22,957 --> 00:06:27,109
Well, we'll just have to
do something about that, won't we?</i>

131
00:06:37,157 --> 00:06:39,148
- Hey, Greg.
- It's Craig.</i>

132
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:41,114
Oh, right. Nice lunch with Elaine?</i>

133
00:06:42,157 --> 00:06:43,351
Yes, lovely.</i>

134
00:06:43,517 --> 00:06:46,475
You know, I'm just curious, how did
you know she wasn't my girlfriend?</i>

135
00:06:46,637 --> 00:06:49,026
Well, I could just sense it.</i>

136
00:06:49,197 --> 00:06:50,630
You know, we used to go out.</i>

137
00:06:50,797 --> 00:06:54,836
- Oh, you did?
- Oh, yeah, we went way out and wild.</i>

138
00:06:55,717 --> 00:06:58,106
- Hey, Jer.
- Hi, Elaine.</i>

139
00:06:58,277 --> 00:07:01,428
Would you like to buy a rose
for your wife?</i>

140
00:07:02,957 --> 00:07:05,346
How do you know
she's not my wife?</i>

141
00:07:07,277 --> 00:07:09,233
I wanna know,
how did that get into my car?</i>

142
00:07:09,397 --> 00:07:12,992
Hey, look, you walk in this city,
things are gonna stick to your foot.</i>

143
00:07:13,157 --> 00:07:15,671
You open your car and... condom.</i>

144
00:07:16,877 --> 00:07:19,107
That doesn't explain
the lipstick on the dashboard.</i>

145
00:07:19,277 --> 00:07:22,394
Here, take a few shirts.</i>

146
00:07:25,757 --> 00:07:27,588
- What?
- I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Kramer...</i>

147
00:07:27,757 --> 00:07:30,794
...but we can't get your car now.
The keys have been misplaced.</i>

148
00:07:30,957 --> 00:07:33,517
I need those keys. I won't be able
to get into my apartment.</i>

149
00:07:33,677 --> 00:07:37,033
Mr. Kramer, you like Cadillacs?</i>

150
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:40,625
Yeah, I like Cadillacs.
Why, what do you got on your mind?</i>

151
00:07:41,477 --> 00:07:44,150
Take that pink Cadillac Eldorado
over there.</i>

152
00:07:44,317 --> 00:07:45,750
It's a Mary Kay car.

153
00:07:45,917 --> 00:07:48,351
- Mary Kay?
- Mary Kay car.

154
00:07:48,517 --> 00:07:50,394
I'll see you later.
Thanks for driving me.</i>

155
00:07:50,557 --> 00:07:52,866
Hey, what's happening?</i>

156
00:07:53,037 --> 00:07:55,073
I'm gonna hang around here
a little while.</i>

157
00:07:55,237 --> 00:07:56,989
Something funny going on here.</i>

158
00:07:58,477 --> 00:08:01,275
You were wrong about Craig.
He's a very sweet guy.</i>

159
00:08:01,437 --> 00:08:02,790
Well, what about the ponytail?</i>

160
00:08:02,957 --> 00:08:04,390
- What about it?
- Come on.</i>

161
00:08:04,557 --> 00:08:06,832
Ponytail? Get real.</i>

162
00:08:07,437 --> 00:08:10,474
All I know is he promised me
a discount on that dress.</i>

163
00:08:10,637 --> 00:08:12,355
Of course he did.
The guy's working you.</i>

164
00:08:12,517 --> 00:08:15,509
Oh, Jerry, I've been around enough
to know when I'm being worked.</i>

165
00:08:15,677 --> 00:08:19,352
- Have you slept with him yet?
- I just met him this morning.</i>

166
00:08:20,237 --> 00:08:21,431
It's been known to happen.</i>

167
00:08:22,557 --> 00:08:24,229
I'm telling you right now, Elaine...</i>

168
00:08:24,397 --> 00:08:26,752
...this guy's gonna dangle that dress
in front of you...</i>

169
00:08:26,917 --> 00:08:29,795
...like a dirt farmer
dangles a carrot in front of a mule.</i>

170
00:08:30,557 --> 00:08:32,149
Well, this is all very flattering-</i>

171
00:08:32,317 --> 00:08:35,434
- Like a shark fisherman with chum.
- Okay.</i>

172
00:08:35,597 --> 00:08:38,395
- Like a shrimp farmer-
- Okay.</i>

173
00:08:39,877 --> 00:08:41,788
Well, that's the grand tour...</i>

174
00:08:41,957 --> 00:08:44,266
- ... but I saved the best for last.
- Oh, yeah.</i>

175
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:47,273
Behold, the Technicolor Dreamcoat.</i>

176
00:08:49,277 --> 00:08:50,915
Spectacular.</i>

177
00:08:52,477 --> 00:08:55,116
Excuse me. Would you mind
if I ask you a few questions?</i>

178
00:08:56,197 --> 00:08:57,425
Are you a cop?</i>

179
00:08:57,597 --> 00:09:00,794
Oh, no, no. No, I'm not a cop.
I work for the Yankees.</i>

180
00:09:01,557 --> 00:09:02,751
They stink.</i>

181
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:09,515
Nevertheless, I was wondering
if you and your friends...</i>

182
00:09:09,677 --> 00:09:12,475
...are doing business
here at the Jiffy Park?</i>

183
00:09:12,637 --> 00:09:15,754
You know,
what do you people call it?</i>

184
00:09:15,917 --> 00:09:17,794
Turning tricks?

185
00:09:19,557 --> 00:09:22,230
Anyway, see, the thing is,
I found a condom in my car.</i>

186
00:09:22,397 --> 00:09:23,910
Now, I'm not saying it's yours...

187
00:09:24,077 --> 00:09:26,386
...I just wanna know
if I should change parking lots.</i>

188
00:09:26,997 --> 00:09:29,431
Get lost, mister.
I'm trying to make a living here.</i>

189
00:09:29,597 --> 00:09:32,236
I'll pay for your time.
I just need some information.</i>

190
00:09:32,397 --> 00:09:34,467
How much do you want?
Ten? Fifteen?</i>

191
00:09:34,637 --> 00:09:36,355
- You have change for 20?
- Fifteen?</i>

192
00:09:36,517 --> 00:09:37,836
- Well...
- George?</i>

193
00:09:37,997 --> 00:09:39,476
Hi, honey.</i>

194
00:09:49,477 --> 00:09:52,708
- I hope that you're telling me the truth.
- Of course I'm telling the truth.</i>

195
00:09:52,877 --> 00:09:54,833
Because I have to be able
to trust you.</i>

196
00:09:54,997 --> 00:09:57,909
If I can't trust you,
there's no way that this can work.</i>

197
00:10:01,837 --> 00:10:03,395
Really?</i>

198
00:10:03,557 --> 00:10:04,990
Yeah.</i>

199
00:10:05,597 --> 00:10:07,906
Well, then you really have
something to think about...</i>

200
00:10:08,077 --> 00:10:10,716
...because, you know,
if there's any doubt in your mind-</i>

201
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:13,107
And it doesn't even have
to be a big doubt, you know.</i>

202
00:10:13,277 --> 00:10:14,915
Even a tiny doubt,
a dot of a doubt-</i>

203
00:10:15,077 --> 00:10:16,066
There's no doubt.</i>

204
00:10:16,237 --> 00:10:19,354
Because if there's any doubt at all,
I feel that we should cultivate it.</i>

205
00:10:19,757 --> 00:10:20,951
Cultivate it?</i>

206
00:10:21,517 --> 00:10:24,395
Yes, you know, deal with it.
We have to deal with the doubt, Susan.</i>

207
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,627
The doubt must be dealt with.</i>

208
00:10:26,797 --> 00:10:29,436
I have no doubt, George. Do you?</i>

209
00:10:31,477 --> 00:10:33,468
No.

210
00:10:35,077 --> 00:10:37,033
You know, I can't wait
to get that dress.</i>

211
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:39,234
Yeah, it should arrive imminently.</i>

212
00:10:39,397 --> 00:10:40,625
Arrive?</i>

213
00:10:40,797 --> 00:10:43,470
- Yes, from Milan.
- But you said it was in the store.</i>

214
00:10:43,637 --> 00:10:46,151
No, no, no. We sold out.
We've had to order some more.</i>

215
00:10:46,317 --> 00:10:49,309
- But I thought Nicole Miller was ma-
- Well-</i>

216
00:10:49,477 --> 00:10:51,672
- Ian.
- Hey, Craig.</i>

217
00:10:51,837 --> 00:10:53,156
Elaine, this is Ian.</i>

218
00:10:53,317 --> 00:10:55,273
- Oh, hi, Ian.
- Ian.

219
00:10:55,437 --> 00:10:57,268
- Ian.
- Ian.

220
00:10:57,437 --> 00:10:59,667
He's a friend of mine from England.</i>

221
00:10:59,837 --> 00:11:01,190
So tell me, how are you doing?</i>

222
00:11:01,357 --> 00:11:03,587
Well, I'm working over
at The Andover Shop, actually.</i>

223
00:11:03,757 --> 00:11:05,076
You should come by.</i>

224
00:11:05,237 --> 00:11:06,875
I'll get you a great discount.</i>

225
00:11:07,037 --> 00:11:08,470
Maybe I will.</i>

226
00:11:09,037 --> 00:11:11,392
- Nice meeting you.
- Oh, nice to meet you.</i>

227
00:11:11,557 --> 00:11:13,991
- Cheerio.
- Bye, Ian.</i>

228
00:11:14,677 --> 00:11:16,588
So you getting him a discount too?</i>

229
00:11:16,757 --> 00:11:18,668
Well, why so surprised?</i>

230
00:11:18,837 --> 00:11:20,395
No reason.</i>

231
00:11:24,677 --> 00:11:27,874
That clothing salesman had a lot of
nerve hitting on Elaine in front of me.</i>

232
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:31,588
He stands to make a big commission
too, on that jacket with the crest...</i>

233
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:33,509
...that nobody seems to like.</i>

234
00:11:34,157 --> 00:11:37,308
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna take that jacket back.</i>

235
00:11:37,557 --> 00:11:40,310
I'm putting this guy
right out of commission.

236
00:11:41,357 --> 00:11:44,315
All right. I'm gonna turn in.

237
00:11:44,477 --> 00:11:47,116
- Turn in?
- Yeah, I had a tough day.</i>

238
00:11:48,117 --> 00:11:49,345
It's only 9:00.

239
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:53,153
Yeah, well, you know,
I don't argue with the body, Jerry.</i>

240
00:11:53,317 --> 00:11:55,751
That's an argument you can't win.</i>

241
00:11:55,917 --> 00:11:57,350
I can't go to sleep at 9:00.</i>

242
00:11:58,037 --> 00:12:01,188
Well, you can
go to your room and read.</i>

243
00:12:02,997 --> 00:12:05,511
Hey, look, you know,
you're the one who's locked out.</i>

244
00:12:05,677 --> 00:12:07,986
I'm letting you stay here.
You're wearing my bathrobe.</i>

245
00:12:08,157 --> 00:12:09,351
You should adapt to me.</i>

246
00:12:09,517 --> 00:12:11,189
But I'm tired.</i>

247
00:12:11,357 --> 00:12:13,109
Why don't you go sleep
at Newman's?</i>

248
00:12:13,277 --> 00:12:14,949
Oh, he's got a girl up there.</i>

249
00:12:15,117 --> 00:12:18,587
This quilt is too thin.
I know I'm gonna get cold.</i>

250
00:12:18,757 --> 00:12:21,510
I don't even fit on this couch.</i>

251
00:12:22,357 --> 00:12:23,949
I don't even know if I'm gonna sleep.</i>

252
00:12:24,117 --> 00:12:25,311
Well, that's all I've got.</i>

253
00:12:27,517 --> 00:12:29,553
Well, can I sleep with you?</i>

254
00:12:33,517 --> 00:12:35,553
Well, you've got that big,
comfortable bed...</i>

255
00:12:35,717 --> 00:12:37,673
...and that nice, warm quilt.</i>

256
00:12:37,837 --> 00:12:40,954
Kramer, there's no way
you're sleeping with me.</i>

257
00:12:41,197 --> 00:12:42,516
- Why?
- Why?

258
00:12:42,677 --> 00:12:45,828
- Yeah.
- Do I really have to explain why?</i>

259
00:12:45,997 --> 00:12:47,430
- Well, I-
- Hey.</i>

260
00:12:47,597 --> 00:12:49,986
- Hey.
- What's that?</i>

261
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:54,225
Squire's walking stick.
I had to write about it for the catalog.</i>

262
00:12:55,877 --> 00:12:57,595
- You want it?
- Yeah.</i>

263
00:12:57,757 --> 00:12:59,554
You can have it.
I don't need it anymore.</i>

264
00:12:59,717 --> 00:13:02,277
Oh, mama.

265
00:13:06,117 --> 00:13:10,429
Okay, so I am positive
you are wrong about Craig.</i>

266
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:11,746
Yeah, why?</i>

267
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:15,910
Because he told a man he'd give him
a discount too. A man, Jerry.</i>

268
00:13:16,077 --> 00:13:18,307
- So? Who is he?
- Some friend of his from England.</i>

269
00:13:18,477 --> 00:13:20,388
Don't you see?</i>

270
00:13:20,557 --> 00:13:23,594
- It's all a big scam.
- You're nuts.</i>

271
00:13:23,757 --> 00:13:26,635
Well, how do you know he's not
wondering the same thing about you?</i>

272
00:13:27,357 --> 00:13:29,473
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?</i>

273
00:13:29,637 --> 00:13:33,186
Well, perhaps he thinks that
you're working him for the discount.</i>

274
00:13:33,357 --> 00:13:37,714
Shaking that little butt of yours
into big, big savings.</i>

275
00:13:37,877 --> 00:13:40,710
Then when you get it, you know,
you drop him like a hot potato.</i>

276
00:13:40,877 --> 00:13:41,992
Oh, please.</i>

277
00:13:42,157 --> 00:13:44,671
No, see, the two of you
need to work on trust.</i>

278
00:13:44,837 --> 00:13:46,190
And then, and only then...</i>

279
00:13:46,357 --> 00:13:49,588
...will there be a free exchange
of sex and discounts.</i>

280
00:13:51,117 --> 00:13:53,995
The cornerstones
of a healthy relationship.</i>

281
00:13:54,157 --> 00:13:58,116
And now, if you would excuse us...</i>

282
00:13:58,717 --> 00:14:00,833
...we need to get to bed.</i>

283
00:14:21,677 --> 00:14:23,429
Yeah.</i>

284
00:14:24,517 --> 00:14:27,270
This patio furniture's on sale.</i>

285
00:14:30,277 --> 00:14:33,075
Excuse me.
I think I made a big mistake.</i>

286
00:14:33,237 --> 00:14:36,229
- I'd like my deposit back, please.
- What's the problem?</i>

287
00:14:36,397 --> 00:14:39,230
You got hookers turning tricks
in my car. How's that for starters?</i>

288
00:14:39,397 --> 00:14:40,716
That is all hearsay.</i>

289
00:14:41,557 --> 00:14:44,025
All right, very good.
I'd like my car and deposit back.</i>

290
00:14:44,637 --> 00:14:46,946
- Can't do it.
- What do you mean?</i>

291
00:14:47,117 --> 00:14:49,756
If you read the agreement,
the deposit is nonrefundable.</i>

292
00:14:50,317 --> 00:14:51,909
Does it say anything
in the contract...</i>

293
00:14:52,077 --> 00:14:53,874
...about my car
being used as a whorehouse?</i>

294
00:14:54,037 --> 00:14:55,914
I don't remember reading
that clause either.</i>

295
00:14:56,797 --> 00:14:59,436
What can I tell you, buddy?
Take it up with Consumer Affairs.</i>

296
00:15:01,517 --> 00:15:04,350
All right, just give me my car
and let me get the hell out of here.</i>

297
00:15:04,517 --> 00:15:06,587
That's going to be a problem.</i>

298
00:15:08,397 --> 00:15:10,149
- Why?
- It's all the way in the back.</i>

299
00:15:10,317 --> 00:15:12,069
We can't get it out
for a couple of days.</i>

300
00:15:12,757 --> 00:15:15,669
What are you talking about?
I want my car.</i>

301
00:15:15,837 --> 00:15:17,987
We ask that you
please bear with us.</i>

302
00:15:18,397 --> 00:15:20,035
Bear with you?</i>

303
00:15:20,197 --> 00:15:21,550
This is a parking lot.

304
00:15:21,717 --> 00:15:23,867
People are supposed
to be able to get their cars.</i>

305
00:15:24,357 --> 00:15:26,109
Ideally.</i>

306
00:15:28,237 --> 00:15:29,989
Excuse me,
I'd like to return this jacket.</i>

307
00:15:30,157 --> 00:15:31,749
Certainly. May I ask why?</i>

308
00:15:32,517 --> 00:15:34,189
For spite.</i>

309
00:15:35,917 --> 00:15:37,555
Spite?</i>

310
00:15:37,717 --> 00:15:40,834
That's right. I don't care for
the salesman that sold it to me.</i>

311
00:15:40,997 --> 00:15:43,830
I don't think you can
return an item for spite.</i>

312
00:15:44,357 --> 00:15:46,917
- What do you mean?
- If there was some problem with it...</i>

313
00:15:47,077 --> 00:15:50,035
...if it were unsatisfactory in some way,
then we could do it for you.</i>

314
00:15:50,197 --> 00:15:53,826
But I'm afraid spite doesn't fit
any of our conditions for a refund.</i>

315
00:15:53,997 --> 00:15:56,557
I wanna return it. What's the difference
what the reason is?</i>

316
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:59,425
Let me speak with the manager.
Excuse me.</i>

317
00:15:59,597 --> 00:16:00,996
Bob?

318
00:16:01,157 --> 00:16:04,433
This gentleman...
Spite.</i>

319
00:16:07,757 --> 00:16:10,317
- What seems to be the problem?
- I wanna return this jacket.</i>

320
00:16:10,477 --> 00:16:13,514
She asked me why, I said, "For spite,"
and now she won't take it back.</i>

321
00:16:14,397 --> 00:16:19,187
That's true. We can't return an item
based purely on spite.</i>

322
00:16:19,717 --> 00:16:22,754
Well, so fine, then. Then I don't
want it. That's why I'm returning it.</i>

323
00:16:22,917 --> 00:16:25,954
Well, you already said spite, so...</i>

324
00:16:26,637 --> 00:16:29,834
- But I changed my mind.
- No, you said spite.</i>

325
00:16:29,997 --> 00:16:31,715
Too late.</i>

326
00:16:31,877 --> 00:16:36,075
- Nice hat.
- Get a calendar, honey. It's the '90s.</i>

327
00:16:36,637 --> 00:16:37,865
- Elaine.
- Oh, hey.</i>

328
00:16:38,037 --> 00:16:39,755
These are my friends,
Jerry and Elaine.</i>

329
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:41,191
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you doing?</i>

330
00:16:41,357 --> 00:16:42,949
- I'm Charmaine.
- I'm Ethan.</i>

331
00:16:43,117 --> 00:16:46,154
Yeah, she's the costume designer,
and he's the wig master for the show.</i>

332
00:16:46,317 --> 00:16:48,592
- Oh, you're staying with George.
- Right, George.</i>

333
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:50,554
I get the feeling
he doesn't want me there.</i>

334
00:16:50,717 --> 00:16:52,708
He doesn't even want himself there.</i>

335
00:16:53,717 --> 00:16:55,753
- Why don't you sit down and join us?
- All right.

336
00:16:55,917 --> 00:16:57,669
I can't. I've gotta go meet a friend.</i>

337
00:16:57,837 --> 00:17:00,226
Well, what are we, dog meat?</i>

338
00:17:00,397 --> 00:17:02,467
Another champagne coolie, please.</i>

339
00:17:02,637 --> 00:17:05,754
- You have really beautiful hair.
- Oh, thanks. Thanks very much.</i>

340
00:17:05,917 --> 00:17:08,385
Ever thought of selling it?
It would make a brilliant wig.</i>

341
00:17:08,557 --> 00:17:11,435
- They make wigs out of human hair?
- And pay plenty for them.</i>

342
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,508
Okay, well, you guys
are gonna have fun here.</i>

343
00:17:13,677 --> 00:17:15,588
- All right.
- See you later.</i>

344
00:17:15,757 --> 00:17:18,635
I just remembered, I gotta get
the Dreamcoat from the dry cleaner.</i>

345
00:17:18,797 --> 00:17:21,755
- You'll let me wear the other one?
- Yeah, but you have to be careful.</i>

346
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:24,511
- It's my only backup.
- Who do you think you're talking to?</i>

347
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:25,826
- Okay, bye-bye.
- Bye.</i>

348
00:17:25,997 --> 00:17:27,396
Bye.</i>

349
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:30,987
There's your champagne coolie.</i>

350
00:17:31,797 --> 00:17:34,106
Well, looks like
it's just you and me, cowboy.</i>

351
00:17:34,277 --> 00:17:35,710
Yeah, I guess so.</i>

352
00:17:36,477 --> 00:17:37,671
Well, here we are.</i>

353
00:17:37,837 --> 00:17:40,351
I am beat.</i>

354
00:17:41,357 --> 00:17:43,109
That's nice.</i>

355
00:17:44,557 --> 00:17:46,070
So...</i>

356
00:17:46,237 --> 00:17:50,150
So do you have any idea when
the Nicole Millers are coming in?</i>

357
00:17:50,917 --> 00:17:52,873
Oh, yeah, the Nicole Millers.</i>

358
00:17:53,037 --> 00:17:54,550
Well, the funniest thing.</i>

359
00:17:54,717 --> 00:17:57,026
I've learned that the new shipment's
coming by boat...</i>

360
00:17:57,197 --> 00:18:00,473
...which does tend to take a bit longer,
what with the waves and all.</i>

361
00:18:01,477 --> 00:18:05,595
So you'll just have to be
a little bit patient.</i>

362
00:18:05,757 --> 00:18:08,555
So you have no idea
when they'll arrive?</i>

363
00:18:08,717 --> 00:18:10,867
No, I'm really not sure.</i>

364
00:18:13,517 --> 00:18:15,906
How can you love a guy like that?
He's a mess.</i>

365
00:18:16,077 --> 00:18:17,510
I don't see them together at all.</i>

366
00:18:18,317 --> 00:18:20,148
- Ethan?
- Yes?</i>

367
00:18:20,317 --> 00:18:22,467
Hi, it's me, Jesse.</i>

368
00:18:22,637 --> 00:18:24,195
George Hamilton's
personal assistant.</i>

369
00:18:24,357 --> 00:18:27,713
- Right, right. How are you?
- Good. Good to see you.</i>

370
00:18:27,877 --> 00:18:29,276
- This is Jerry.
- Hello.</i>

371
00:18:29,437 --> 00:18:30,870
Yeah.</i>

372
00:18:31,037 --> 00:18:32,390
Ethan, what brings you to town?

373
00:18:32,557 --> 00:18:34,787
Joseph and the Amazing
Technicolor Dreamcoat.</i>

374
00:18:34,957 --> 00:18:39,030
You're kidding. Listen, maybe
you and I should get together.</i>

375
00:18:39,197 --> 00:18:41,950
Have you been on the slide
at Club USA? It's intense.</i>

376
00:18:42,117 --> 00:18:45,029
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Are you asking him out?</i>

377
00:18:45,517 --> 00:18:46,950
Yeah, I guess you could say that.</i>

378
00:18:47,117 --> 00:18:48,709
Right in front of me?</i>

379
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,469
How do you know
we're not together?</i>

380
00:18:50,637 --> 00:18:53,515
Two guys sitting, laughing,
drinking champagne coolies.</i>

381
00:18:54,157 --> 00:18:56,068
I don't know.
I just didn't think you were.</i>

382
00:18:56,237 --> 00:18:58,193
Well, we're sitting here together.</i>

383
00:18:58,357 --> 00:18:59,551
Why wouldn't you think that?

384
00:19:00,477 --> 00:19:01,956
I don't know. I just didn't.

385
00:19:02,117 --> 00:19:04,187
Well, it's very emasculating.</i>

386
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:12,911
- Hello?
- This is Bob from The Andover Shop.</i>

387
00:19:13,077 --> 00:19:15,750
I'm trying to reach Craig Stewart.
He left this number.</i>

388
00:19:17,117 --> 00:19:19,187
Oh, is it important?

389
00:19:19,357 --> 00:19:21,951
- Well...
- Hey, let me ask you something.</i>

390
00:19:22,117 --> 00:19:24,995
Do you know when the Nicole Millers
are coming in from Milan?</i>

391
00:19:25,157 --> 00:19:26,146
Nicole Milers?</i>

392
00:19:26,317 --> 00:19:30,469
We aren't expecting any Nicole Millers.
In fact, we have too many as it is.</i>

393
00:19:32,117 --> 00:19:35,268
Well, do you have any
in a size four?</i>

394
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,156
Yes, several.</i>

395
00:19:37,317 --> 00:19:40,150
Just tell him he doesn't have
to be in tomorrow until 11.</i>

396
00:19:40,317 --> 00:19:43,434
Oh, yeah, I'll make sure
he gets the message.</i>

397
00:19:47,997 --> 00:19:49,715
They mak e wigs out of human hair?</i>

398
00:19:49,877 --> 00:19:51,993
And pay plenty for them.</i>

399
00:20:40,557 --> 00:20:42,070
Oh, sweet Maria.</i>

400
00:20:43,997 --> 00:20:46,465
Hey, let's go.</i>

401
00:20:49,997 --> 00:20:51,510
What are you doing in my car?</i>

402
00:20:51,677 --> 00:20:53,395
Hey, hey, where are you going?</i>

403
00:20:53,557 --> 00:20:55,912
- Hey, you just cost me some money.
- Hey, cool it, lady.</i>

404
00:20:58,637 --> 00:21:01,151
Cool it. Cool it, lady. Cool it.

405
00:21:01,317 --> 00:21:03,956
Police officers, freeze right there.</i>

406
00:21:12,477 --> 00:21:15,230
Okay, big daddy, take the hat off.</i>

407
00:21:16,037 --> 00:21:18,153
All right, turn to your right.

408
00:21:18,317 --> 00:21:20,706
I said turn, pimp!

409
00:21:21,717 --> 00:21:23,753
I'm not a pimp.
