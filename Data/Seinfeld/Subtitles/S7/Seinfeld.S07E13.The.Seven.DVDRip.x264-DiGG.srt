1
00:00:02,487 --> 00:00:04,125
<i>I love it when people
are complimented on their clothes.</i>

2
00:00:05,727 --> 00:00:08,195
<i>And they accept the compliment
as if it was about them.</i>

3
00:00:08,367 --> 00:00:11,564
<i>Nice tie. Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.</i>

4
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:16,438
<i>The compliment is for the tie.
It's not for you. But we take it.</i>

5
00:00:16,647 --> 00:00:19,878
<i>And that's the job of clothes.
To get compliments for us.</i>

6
00:00:20,047 --> 00:00:22,163
<i>Because it's very hard
to get compliments...</i>

7
00:00:22,327 --> 00:00:25,637
<i>...based on your human qualities.
Right? Let's face it.</i>

8
00:00:25,807 --> 00:00:28,002
<i>No matter how nice you are,
nobody is gonna say:</i>

9
00:00:28,167 --> 00:00:30,123
<i>"Hey, nice person."</i>

10
00:00:30,807 --> 00:00:34,686
<i>It's much easier to be a bastard and
just try and match the colours up.</i>

11
00:00:39,207 --> 00:00:41,880
Oh, look at this.

12
00:00:42,047 --> 00:00:45,403
<i>Boy. Oh, I miss the days when
they made toys that could kill a kid.</i>

13
00:00:47,207 --> 00:00:49,437
Oh, cool. Look at that.

14
00:00:49,647 --> 00:00:51,638
<i>Yeah, I'm right there with you.</i>

15
00:00:51,807 --> 00:00:56,198
<i>That is a Schwinn Sting-Ray.
And it's the girls' model.</i>

16
00:00:56,367 --> 00:00:59,200
<i>Oh, I always wanted one
of these when I was little.</i>

17
00:00:59,407 --> 00:01:01,841
<i>What do you think, Jerry?</i>

18
00:01:02,967 --> 00:01:05,720
<i>Jerry. What do you think?</i>

19
00:01:05,887 --> 00:01:08,526
<i>Oh, yeah, it would be great
for your paper route.</i>

20
00:01:08,687 --> 00:01:10,086
<i>I love it. I'm getting it.</i>

21
00:01:10,287 --> 00:01:13,757
<i>Can you help me get it down, Jerr?
Jerry.</i>

22
00:01:13,967 --> 00:01:16,800
<i>- Your friend needs some help.
- The only way to really help her...</i>

23
00:01:16,967 --> 00:01:18,719
<i>...is to just let her be.</i>

24
00:01:26,847 --> 00:01:28,439
<i>Hey.</i>

25
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:36,480
<i>- A little baby girl?
- Doctor says it could be any day now.</i>

26
00:01:37,327 --> 00:01:41,366
<i>So, Carrie, you and Susan
are cousins.</i>

27
00:01:42,047 --> 00:01:45,756
<i>So your baby daughter is gonna be
Susan's second cousin, right?</i>

28
00:01:45,927 --> 00:01:48,964
<i>- So, what does that make me?
- It doesn't make you anything.</i>

29
00:01:49,847 --> 00:01:53,203
<i>Well, so, legally, I could
marry your daughter.</i>

30
00:01:59,727 --> 00:02:01,365
<i>So have you picked out a name yet?</i>

31
00:02:01,567 --> 00:02:03,717
<i>Well, we've narrowed
it down to a few.</i>

32
00:02:03,887 --> 00:02:05,115
<i>We like Kimberly.</i>

33
00:02:05,487 --> 00:02:07,762
Oh, boy.

34
00:02:07,967 --> 00:02:09,844
<i>You don't like Kimberly?</i>

35
00:02:11,367 --> 00:02:13,358
<i>- What else you got?
- How about Joan?</i>

36
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:15,876
<i>- Come on, I'm eating here.
- George.</i>

37
00:02:16,087 --> 00:02:18,760
<i>- Pamela?
- Pamela?</i>

38
00:02:19,727 --> 00:02:21,080
<i>All right. I'll tell you what.</i>

39
00:02:21,247 --> 00:02:23,556
<i>You look like nice people.
I'm gonna help you out.</i>

40
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:27,719
<i>You want a beautiful name? Soda.</i>

41
00:02:29,247 --> 00:02:30,805
- What?
- Soda.

42
00:02:31,167 --> 00:02:33,078
S- O-D-A. Soda.

43
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:35,437
<i>I don't know.
It sounds a little strange.</i>

44
00:02:36,047 --> 00:02:38,641
<i>All names sound strange
the first time you hear them.</i>

45
00:02:38,807 --> 00:02:41,002
<i>Are you telling me people
loved the name Blanche...</i>

46
00:02:41,167 --> 00:02:43,362
<i>...the first time they heard it?</i>

47
00:02:43,567 --> 00:02:46,559
<i>- Yeah, but Soda?
- Yeah, that's right.</i>

48
00:02:46,727 --> 00:02:48,843
<i>- It's working.
- We'll put it on the list.</i>

49
00:02:49,647 --> 00:02:52,878
<i>I solve problems.
That's just what I do.</i>

50
00:02:57,327 --> 00:02:59,795
<i>Yeah, let's look at that boy.</i>

51
00:03:00,527 --> 00:03:01,801
That's good.

52
00:03:01,967 --> 00:03:03,605
<i>You're going to town with that turkey.</i>

53
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,837
<i>Oh, yeah. I got a big appetite.</i>

54
00:03:07,327 --> 00:03:09,045
<i>Oh, Jerry. You got no mustard.</i>

55
00:03:09,247 --> 00:03:11,920
<i>- It's on the door.
- What, this yellow stuff?</i>

56
00:03:12,087 --> 00:03:13,918
<i>No, I said, mustard, Jerry. Dijon.</i>

57
00:03:15,407 --> 00:03:17,159
I still wanna do it.

58
00:03:18,927 --> 00:03:20,326
No.

59
00:03:22,167 --> 00:03:23,441
<i>That's bush league. No.</i>

60
00:03:24,127 --> 00:03:26,118
<i>Hey, wait. You're just gonna
leave it there?</i>

61
00:03:26,287 --> 00:03:28,437
<i>- It's half a pound of turkey.
- I can't eat that.</i>

62
00:03:28,607 --> 00:03:30,359
<i>You can't eat a sandwich
without Dijon.</i>

63
00:03:30,527 --> 00:03:33,997
<i>Yeah, you're right. I really should keep
more of your favourites on hand.</i>

64
00:03:34,727 --> 00:03:38,640
<i>Hey, hey, hey.
I'm getting a vibe here.</i>

65
00:03:39,367 --> 00:03:41,278
<i>What, are you unhappy
with our arrangement?</i>

66
00:03:42,087 --> 00:03:43,759
<i>What arrangement?</i>

67
00:03:43,967 --> 00:03:46,765
<i>I was under the impression that
I could take anything I wanted...</i>

68
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:48,997
<i>...from your fridge. You take
whatever from mine.</i>

69
00:03:49,207 --> 00:03:51,562
<i>Let me know when you get
something in there, and I will.</i>

70
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:54,441
<i>- Oh, hey.
- Hey.</i>

71
00:03:54,607 --> 00:03:57,440
<i>Hey. What's with your neck?</i>

72
00:03:58,367 --> 00:04:01,916
<i>It's still killing me from having
to get that bike off the wall...</i>

73
00:04:02,087 --> 00:04:03,406
<i>...by myself.</i>

74
00:04:03,687 --> 00:04:06,440
<i>Well, if it's any consolation,
I did get her number.</i>

75
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:08,683
<i>I think I really strained it.</i>

76
00:04:08,847 --> 00:04:10,963
<i>Oh, I doubt you strained it.
Maybe you pulled it.</i>

77
00:04:11,127 --> 00:04:12,719
<i>- Maybe.
- Did you twist it?</i>

78
00:04:12,887 --> 00:04:14,718
<i>- You could have twisted it?
- I don't know.</i>

79
00:04:14,927 --> 00:04:16,599
<i>Did you wrench it?
Did you jam it?</i>

80
00:04:16,767 --> 00:04:19,122
<i>- Maybe you squeezed it and turned it?
- Why don't you...</i>

81
00:04:19,287 --> 00:04:21,562
<i>- ... just shut the hell up.
- All right.</i>

82
00:04:22,607 --> 00:04:24,199
<i>God, man, this is killing me.</i>

83
00:04:24,367 --> 00:04:28,042
<i>I would give that bike to the person
who could make this pain go away.</i>

84
00:04:28,247 --> 00:04:32,479
<i>- You're really hurting, huh?
- Oh, Kramer, it's just awful.</i>

85
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,717
<i>Well, you're arterioles
have constricted.</i>

86
00:04:34,927 --> 00:04:36,485
<i>All right, lean forward. Relax.</i>

87
00:04:36,647 --> 00:04:38,763
<i>- What? What?
- Encounter shiatsu.</i>

88
00:04:38,927 --> 00:04:40,838
<i>Wait a minute. You know
what you're doing?</i>

89
00:04:41,007 --> 00:04:44,397
<i>Oh, yeah. A wise man once
taught me the healing power...</i>

90
00:04:44,567 --> 00:04:46,922
<i>...of the body's
natural pressure points.</i>

91
00:04:47,127 --> 00:04:49,118
<i>He sells T-shirts near
the World Trade Center.</i>

92
00:04:50,687 --> 00:04:52,006
<i>He's a genius.</i>

93
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:53,646
<i>Here we go.
Here we go.</i>

94
00:04:53,807 --> 00:04:55,684
<i>All right, from pain
will come pleasure.</i>

95
00:04:58,487 --> 00:04:59,886
Voilà.

96
00:05:00,607 --> 00:05:02,359
<i>- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.</i>

97
00:05:02,527 --> 00:05:06,315
<i>Wow, that is unbelievable.</i>

98
00:05:06,487 --> 00:05:08,682
<i>That pain is totally gone.</i>

99
00:05:08,847 --> 00:05:12,522
<i>What's even more amazing is
his formal training is in paediatrics.</i>

100
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:14,600
<i>All right. My work is done here.</i>

101
00:05:14,767 --> 00:05:16,883
<i>Oh, man. Kramer, thank you.</i>

102
00:05:17,087 --> 00:05:19,681
<i>- You can send that bike over any time.
- What?</i>

103
00:05:20,207 --> 00:05:22,596
<i>- What is he talking about?
- I don't know.</i>

104
00:05:22,767 --> 00:05:25,156
<i>You said you'd give the bike
to whoever fixes your neck.</i>

105
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:27,835
<i>- You really think he wants the bike?
- Oh, yeah.</i>

106
00:05:28,007 --> 00:05:29,360
<i>But it took him like 10 seconds.</i>

107
00:05:29,567 --> 00:05:32,525
<i>Well, that's the most he's
worked in the last four months.</i>

108
00:05:36,567 --> 00:05:39,286
<i>- I think they really went for that Soda.
- What are you, crazy?</i>

109
00:05:39,447 --> 00:05:41,642
<i>They hated it.
They were just humouring you.</i>

110
00:05:41,807 --> 00:05:43,923
<i>All right. Very good.
Believe me.</i>

111
00:05:44,087 --> 00:05:46,840
<i>- That kid's going to be called Soda.
- I can tell you...</i>

112
00:05:47,007 --> 00:05:48,804
<i>...I would never name my child Soda.</i>

113
00:05:49,007 --> 00:05:50,918
<i>Oh, no, no, no.
No, of course not.</i>

114
00:05:51,087 --> 00:05:53,806
<i>I got a great name for our kids,
a real original.</i>

115
00:05:54,007 --> 00:05:55,884
<i>You wanna hear what it is?
Are you ready?</i>

116
00:05:56,047 --> 00:05:57,446
<i>Yeah.</i>

117
00:05:59,607 --> 00:06:02,246
<i>- What is that, sign language?
- No.</i>

118
00:06:02,727 --> 00:06:04,638
<i>Seven.</i>

119
00:06:04,847 --> 00:06:06,997
<i>Seven Costanza. You're serious?</i>

120
00:06:07,207 --> 00:06:09,675
<i>Yeah, it's a beautiful name
for a boy or a girl.</i>

121
00:06:09,847 --> 00:06:12,998
<i>- Especially a girl. Or a boy.
- I don't think so.</i>

122
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:16,563
<i>- What, you don't like the name?
- It's not a name. It's a number.</i>

123
00:06:16,767 --> 00:06:18,758
<i>I know. It's Mickey Mantle's number.</i>

124
00:06:18,927 --> 00:06:21,077
<i>So not only is it
an all-around beautiful name...</i>

125
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:24,444
<i>- ... it is also a living tribute.
- It's awful. I hate it.</i>

126
00:06:25,287 --> 00:06:28,085
<i>- Well, that's the name.
- Oh, no it is not.</i>

127
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:31,802
<i>No child of mine is ever going
to be named Seven.</i>

128
00:06:32,007 --> 00:06:33,804
<i>All right. Let's just
stay calm here.</i>

129
00:06:33,967 --> 00:06:36,322
<i>Don't get all crazy on me.</i>

130
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,558
<i>Seven? Yeah, I guess
I could see it.</i>

131
00:06:39,727 --> 00:06:42,366
<i>Seven. Seven periods of school.
Seven beatings a day.</i>

132
00:06:43,527 --> 00:06:46,997
<i>Roughly seven stitches a beating,
and, eventually, seven years to life.</i>

133
00:06:47,167 --> 00:06:48,805
<i>You're doing that child
quite a service.</i>

134
00:06:49,007 --> 00:06:50,406
<i>Yes, I am.</i>

135
00:06:50,567 --> 00:06:52,956
<i>I defy you to come up
with a better name than Seven.</i>

136
00:06:53,207 --> 00:06:54,606
<i>All right. Let's see.</i>

137
00:06:54,767 --> 00:06:56,837
How about Mug?

138
00:06:57,047 --> 00:06:59,038
Mug Costanza.

139
00:06:59,207 --> 00:07:00,435
That's original.

140
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:03,485
<i>- Ketchup. Pretty name for a girl.
- Right. You having a good time?</i>

141
00:07:03,647 --> 00:07:06,286
<i>I got 50 right here in the cupboard.
How about Bisquick?</i>

142
00:07:06,687 --> 00:07:10,396
<i>Pimento? Gherkin? Sauce?</i>

143
00:07:10,567 --> 00:07:13,957
<i>- Maxwell House?
- All right, already.</i>

144
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,885
<i>This is a very key issue with me,
Jerry.</i>

145
00:07:16,047 --> 00:07:17,446
<i>I had this name for a long time.</i>

146
00:07:17,607 --> 00:07:19,006
<i>Oh, I forgot to call Christie.</i>

147
00:07:19,207 --> 00:07:20,720
<i>That's the one you met in the store?</i>

148
00:07:20,887 --> 00:07:23,526
<i>She had this great black and white
dress with a scoop neck.</i>

149
00:07:23,687 --> 00:07:25,598
<i>She looked like some
kind of superhero.</i>

150
00:07:25,967 --> 00:07:28,640
<i>And you met her in an antique store.
I don't know how you do it.</i>

151
00:07:28,847 --> 00:07:30,280
<i>I'm not engaged.</i>

152
00:07:32,927 --> 00:07:34,485
- I got it.
- Got what?

153
00:07:34,647 --> 00:07:37,241
<i>I got the answer, Jerry.
Refrigerator problem is solved.</i>

154
00:07:37,647 --> 00:07:39,842
<i>Oh, it's no problem.
You can take whatever you want.</i>

155
00:07:40,047 --> 00:07:42,197
<i>I will. But now I'm accountable.</i>

156
00:07:42,367 --> 00:07:44,198
<i>All right, I take what I want. Here.</i>

157
00:07:44,367 --> 00:07:45,686
<i>And I write it down.</i>

158
00:07:45,847 --> 00:07:47,997
<i>One cupcake.</i>

159
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:50,761
<i>And then I put it in the bowl.</i>

160
00:07:50,927 --> 00:07:53,122
<i>There. Very simple.</i>

161
00:07:53,327 --> 00:07:57,923
<i>- Sort of a mooching inventory.
- No, not mooching.</i>

162
00:07:58,087 --> 00:07:59,918
<i>Because at the end of the week
you add them.</i>

163
00:08:00,087 --> 00:08:01,805
<i>- And you give me the bill.
- All right.</i>

164
00:08:01,967 --> 00:08:03,366
<i>Look, I gotta run some errands.</i>

165
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:06,081
<i>When Elaine comes by with that bike,
hang on to it for me.</i>

166
00:08:06,287 --> 00:08:08,323
<i>Kramer, I don't know
if you're getting that bike.</i>

167
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:11,285
<i>Oh, yes, I am.
We had a verbal contract.</i>

168
00:08:11,447 --> 00:08:14,598
<i>If we can't take each other
at our word, all is lost.</i>

169
00:08:15,887 --> 00:08:17,445
<i>Oh, yeah, yeah, put that on my tab.</i>

170
00:08:21,407 --> 00:08:23,682
<i>Well, this is it.
The food is atrocious.</i>

171
00:08:23,847 --> 00:08:26,680
<i>But the busboys
are the best in the city.</i>

172
00:08:26,887 --> 00:08:30,800
<i>- May I take your coat, miss?
- Yes, thank you.</i>

173
00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:41,242
<i>- The same outfit?
- The exact same outfit.</i>

174
00:08:41,447 --> 00:08:43,722
<i>- How many days between encounters?
- Three.</i>

175
00:08:43,887 --> 00:08:48,358
<i>Three days. Well, maybe you caught
her on the cusp of a new wash cycle.</i>

176
00:08:48,807 --> 00:08:51,002
<i>You know, she did laundry
the day after she met you.</i>

177
00:08:51,167 --> 00:08:53,203
<i>Everything got clean.
She started all over again.</i>

178
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:58,716
<i>Possibly. But then shouldn't the outfit
only reappear at the end of the cycle?</i>

179
00:08:58,927 --> 00:09:01,122
<i>Maybe she moved it up
in the rotation.</i>

180
00:09:02,007 --> 00:09:05,443
<i>Why? It's our first date.
She's already in reruns.</i>

181
00:09:06,287 --> 00:09:08,482
<i>- Very curious.
- Indeed.</i>

182
00:09:08,687 --> 00:09:10,723
<i>Einstein wore the exact same outfit
every day.</i>

183
00:09:10,927 --> 00:09:13,760
<i>Well, if she splits the atom,
I'll let it slide.</i>

184
00:09:15,447 --> 00:09:18,041
<i>- All right. I'm heading home.
- Did Susan change her mind...</i>

185
00:09:18,207 --> 00:09:20,323
<i>- ... about the name?
- Not yet, but she's weakening.</i>

186
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:22,119
<i>Just because your life is destroyed...</i>

187
00:09:22,287 --> 00:09:24,517
<i>...don't destroy someone else's.</i>

188
00:09:24,727 --> 00:09:27,366
<i>It's Mickey Mantle, Jerry.
My idol.</i>

189
00:09:27,527 --> 00:09:30,280
<i>- How about Mickey?
- Mickey?</i>

190
00:09:30,927 --> 00:09:32,645
<i>Mickey...</i>

191
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:41,319
<i>- Is this your half a can of soda?
- Nope, that's yours.</i>

192
00:09:41,487 --> 00:09:43,364
<i>My half is gone.</i>

193
00:09:46,167 --> 00:09:47,520
<i>- What?
- Yeah.</i>

194
00:09:47,727 --> 00:09:50,161
<i>I put my half a can here in the tab.</i>

195
00:09:50,327 --> 00:09:54,206
<i>- Why? What's your beef?
- You cannot buy half a can of soda.</i>

196
00:09:54,367 --> 00:09:57,404
<i>- Well, why not?
- I don't wanna get into the physics of it.</i>

197
00:09:57,567 --> 00:09:59,956
<i>But you know the sound
a can makes when you open it?</i>

198
00:10:00,127 --> 00:10:01,401
<i>- Yeah.
- That is the sound...</i>

199
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:03,239
<i>...of you buying a whole can.</i>

200
00:10:03,407 --> 00:10:06,797
<i>And the same goes for this.
Okay?</i>

201
00:10:06,967 --> 00:10:10,403
<i>When you pierce the skin of a piece
of fruit, you've bought the whole fruit.</i>

202
00:10:10,567 --> 00:10:13,001
<i>Not a third of an apple.
Not a half of a banana.</i>

203
00:10:13,167 --> 00:10:14,885
<i>- All right.
- You bite it, you bought it.</i>

204
00:10:15,087 --> 00:10:17,282
<i>All right. I'll make
the necessary adjustments.</i>

205
00:10:17,447 --> 00:10:19,278
- All right.
- Thank you.

206
00:10:19,447 --> 00:10:21,802
<i>Oh, so how's the neck?</i>

207
00:10:22,007 --> 00:10:23,235
<i>Nice and loose?</i>

208
00:10:23,447 --> 00:10:25,642
<i>Lookit, Kramer, you are
not getting this bike.</i>

209
00:10:25,807 --> 00:10:28,958
<i>I don't even know why you want it.
I mean, it's a girls' bike.</i>

210
00:10:29,127 --> 00:10:31,038
<i>It's a verbal contract.
We had a deal.</i>

211
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:32,475
<i>No, we didn't.</i>

212
00:10:32,647 --> 00:10:34,160
<i>You take these things too literally.</i>

213
00:10:34,327 --> 00:10:37,558
<i>It's like saying you're hungry
enough to eat horse.</i>

214
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:40,839
<i>Well my friend Jay Riemenschneider
eats horse all the time.</i>

215
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:43,362
<i>He gets it from his butcher.</i>

216
00:10:43,527 --> 00:10:44,960
<i>This is not the point.</i>

217
00:10:45,127 --> 00:10:48,517
<i>The point is,
you just can't have the bike.</i>

218
00:10:48,687 --> 00:10:50,917
<i>Boy, I am really surprised at you.</i>

219
00:10:51,087 --> 00:10:54,124
<i>You are the last person I figured
would do something like this.</i>

220
00:10:54,327 --> 00:10:57,717
<i>I mean, George, yeah, I can see that.
Even Jerry.</i>

221
00:10:58,207 --> 00:11:01,756
<i>But not you, Elaine.
I always put you up here.</i>

222
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:04,236
<i>They're over here.</i>

223
00:11:04,407 --> 00:11:07,956
<i>Now you're all:</i>

224
00:11:12,407 --> 00:11:15,877
<i>- All right.
- Yeah.</i>

225
00:11:19,327 --> 00:11:21,716
<i>Come on. It's a fantastic name.</i>

226
00:11:21,927 --> 00:11:25,317
<i>It's a real original. Nobody else is
gonna have it. And I absolutely love it.</i>

227
00:11:25,527 --> 00:11:27,438
<i>Well, I don't know how original
it's gonna be.</i>

228
00:11:28,047 --> 00:11:30,402
<i>- Why not?
- Well, I was telling Carrie...</i>

229
00:11:30,567 --> 00:11:33,798
<i>...about our argument. And when I
told them the name, they just loved it.</i>

230
00:11:34,887 --> 00:11:38,038
<i>- So, what are you saying?
- They're naming their baby Seven.</i>

231
00:11:39,367 --> 00:11:41,323
<i>What? They're stealing the name?</i>

232
00:11:41,487 --> 00:11:42,715
<i>That's my name. I made it up.</i>

233
00:11:42,927 --> 00:11:44,440
<i>I can't believe they're using it.</i>

234
00:11:44,647 --> 00:11:46,205
<i>Now, it's not gonna be original.</i>

235
00:11:46,367 --> 00:11:47,880
<i>It's gonna lose all its cachet.</i>

236
00:11:48,047 --> 00:11:50,117
<i>I don't know how much
cachet it had to begin with.</i>

237
00:11:50,327 --> 00:11:51,760
<i>Oh, it's got cachet, baby.</i>

238
00:11:51,927 --> 00:11:54,600
<i>It's got cachet up the ying-yang.</i>

239
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:01,764
Oh, God.

240
00:12:02,367 --> 00:12:04,835
Oh, God.

241
00:12:06,167 --> 00:12:07,646
<i>Kramer.</i>

242
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:15,719
<i>Watch your step.</i>

243
00:12:18,327 --> 00:12:19,760
<i>Oh, stupid Kramer.</i>

244
00:12:19,967 --> 00:12:22,606
<i>Excuse me, Elaine.</i>

245
00:12:22,767 --> 00:12:24,325
<i>Over here.</i>

246
00:12:24,487 --> 00:12:26,364
<i>I thought that was you.
You're Jerry's friend.</i>

247
00:12:26,567 --> 00:12:28,398
<i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

248
00:12:28,567 --> 00:12:31,286
<i>- Christie?
- Yes, how you doing?</i>

249
00:12:31,487 --> 00:12:33,125
<i>I'm fine.</i>

250
00:12:33,287 --> 00:12:35,437
<i>Well, I gotta run.
It was good to see you.</i>

251
00:12:35,647 --> 00:12:38,207
<i>Okay. It was good to...</i>

252
00:12:38,367 --> 00:12:40,164
<i>Good to see you.</i>

253
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:43,636
<i>- Looking good.
- Hey, Cosmo.</i>

254
00:12:43,807 --> 00:12:46,275
<i>- Nice wheels.
- You got that right.</i>

255
00:12:46,447 --> 00:12:49,120
<i>- Hey, you're riding a girls' bike.
- Kramer.</i>

256
00:12:49,487 --> 00:12:51,125
<i>Kramer.</i>

257
00:12:54,167 --> 00:12:55,964
<i>- He/o.
- Hello, Ken.</i>

258
00:12:56,127 --> 00:12:58,197
<i>It's George Costanza.</i>

259
00:12:58,367 --> 00:13:00,244
<i>I think we need to talk.</i>

260
00:13:01,767 --> 00:13:03,359
<i>Kramer.</i>

261
00:13:04,727 --> 00:13:06,877
<i>- Kramer!
- Hey.</i>

262
00:13:07,047 --> 00:13:09,925
<i>God. Is Kramer back
from his little joyride yet?</i>

263
00:13:10,327 --> 00:13:13,797
<i>- Haven't seen him. How's the neck?
- His chiropractic job was a crock.</i>

264
00:13:13,967 --> 00:13:16,276
<i>I mean, it's even worse
than it was before.</i>

265
00:13:16,487 --> 00:13:18,205
<i>I'd think Kramer
would have a knack...</i>

266
00:13:18,367 --> 00:13:20,244
<i>...for moving a person's spine
around.</i>

267
00:13:21,687 --> 00:13:23,086
<i>Hey, you know what?</i>

268
00:13:23,247 --> 00:13:25,477
<i>I think I ran into that girl
from the antique store.</i>

269
00:13:25,647 --> 00:13:28,798
<i>- What's her name, Christie?
- You saw her? What was she wearing?</i>

270
00:13:30,447 --> 00:13:33,086
<i>I don't know. I couldn't see.
I couldn't look down...</i>

271
00:13:33,247 --> 00:13:35,602
<i>- ... because of my neck.
- Didn't you get a glimpse?</i>

272
00:13:35,767 --> 00:13:37,485
<i>- An impression?
- What do you care?</i>

273
00:13:37,687 --> 00:13:39,882
<i>Both times I've seen her,
she's worn the same dress.</i>

274
00:13:44,367 --> 00:13:46,927
<i>- Did you have a nice ride?
- Oh, great ride.</i>

275
00:13:47,087 --> 00:13:49,965
<i>Oh, that's good,
because it was your last.</i>

276
00:13:52,047 --> 00:13:53,844
<i>What are you talking about?
We had a deal.</i>

277
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:56,959
<i>You gotta give me back that bike.
Look at this! Look!</i>

278
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,038
<i>I couldn't even crawl
out of bed this morning.</i>

279
00:13:59,207 --> 00:14:02,199
<i>Bed? You should be sleeping on
a wooden board for at least a week.</i>

280
00:14:02,407 --> 00:14:05,763
<i>- What? You never told me that.
- Well, it's common sense.</i>

281
00:14:05,927 --> 00:14:08,077
<i>What is he talking about?
He's being ridiculous.</i>

282
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:09,839
<i>Look, Jerry, you know
the whole story.</i>

283
00:14:10,007 --> 00:14:11,406
<i>- You should settle this.
- Yeah.</i>

284
00:14:11,567 --> 00:14:13,319
<i>I'm flattered you'd
appeal to my wisdom.</i>

285
00:14:13,487 --> 00:14:15,717
<i>But, unfortunately,
my friendship to each of you...</i>

286
00:14:15,887 --> 00:14:17,718
<i>...precludes my getting involved.</i>

287
00:14:17,887 --> 00:14:20,196
<i>What you need is
an impartial mediator.</i>

288
00:14:20,407 --> 00:14:22,796
<i>Yeah, I'd go for that.
Would you go for that?</i>

289
00:14:22,967 --> 00:14:24,844
All right, I'm down.

290
00:14:25,367 --> 00:14:27,722
<i>It would have to be someone
who hasn't heard the story.</i>

291
00:14:27,887 --> 00:14:30,879
<i>Someone who is unencumbered
by any emotional attachment.</i>

292
00:14:31,047 --> 00:14:32,526
<i>Someone whose heart is so dark...</i>

293
00:14:32,687 --> 00:14:36,646
<i>...it cannot be swayed by pity, emotion
or human compassion of any kind.</i>

294
00:14:37,207 --> 00:14:38,845
<i>So that's the situation.</i>

295
00:14:40,367 --> 00:14:43,484
<i>You present an interesting dilemma.</i>

296
00:14:44,247 --> 00:14:47,523
<i>Each of you seemingly
has a legitimate claim to the bicycle.</i>

297
00:14:47,847 --> 00:14:52,159
<i>And yet the bicycle can have
only one rightful owner.</i>

298
00:14:52,327 --> 00:14:54,443
<i>Quite the conundrum.</i>

299
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:58,237
<i>As a federal employee,
I believe the law is all we have.</i>

300
00:14:58,407 --> 00:15:00,523
<i>It's all that separates us
from the savages...</i>

301
00:15:00,687 --> 00:15:02,598
<i>...who don't deserve
the privilege of mail.</i>

302
00:15:02,767 --> 00:15:05,076
<i>Stuffing parcels in mailboxes,
where they don't belong.</i>

303
00:15:05,287 --> 00:15:06,959
<i>Newman!</i>

304
00:15:10,727 --> 00:15:15,198
<i>But you must promise
that you will abide by my decision...</i>

305
00:15:15,367 --> 00:15:19,246
<i>...no matter how unjust
it may seem to either of you.</i>

306
00:15:19,407 --> 00:15:21,318
<i>Do I have your word?</i>

307
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:23,318
<i>- All right, yeah.
- Yeah.</i>

308
00:15:23,487 --> 00:15:26,604
<i>All right. Let's begin.</i>

309
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:28,685
My cocoa.

310
00:15:29,967 --> 00:15:31,320
<i>Why can't we use Seven?</i>

311
00:15:31,527 --> 00:15:34,803
<i>It's my name. I made it up.
You can't just steal it.</i>

312
00:15:35,007 --> 00:15:36,998
<i>Well, it's not as if Susan's pregnant.</i>

313
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:39,965
<i>You already postponed the wedding.
Who knows if you'll get married.</i>

314
00:15:40,167 --> 00:15:43,364
<i>Hey, hey, don't worry about me.
I'm not a waffler. I don't waffle.</i>

315
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:45,438
<i>Look, we're both big
Mickey Mantle fans.</i>

316
00:15:45,607 --> 00:15:47,325
<i>And we love the name.
It's very unusual.</i>

317
00:15:47,487 --> 00:15:50,047
<i>What happened to Soda?
I thought we all agreed on Soda.</i>

318
00:15:50,247 --> 00:15:52,556
<i>- We don't care for Soda.
- You don't care for Soda?</i>

319
00:15:52,767 --> 00:15:54,485
<i>No, no. We don't like Soda at all.</i>

320
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:57,679
<i>How do you not like Soda?
It's bubbly. It's refreshing.</i>

321
00:15:57,847 --> 00:15:59,166
<i>- What is it?
- I felt something.</i>

322
00:15:59,327 --> 00:16:01,124
<i>- Are you okay?
- I'm going into labour.</i>

323
00:16:01,287 --> 00:16:04,085
<i>Oh, God. Okay, let's not panic.
Let's just get to the hospital.</i>

324
00:16:04,247 --> 00:16:06,602
<i>- Okay.
- I got the suitcase packed right here.</i>

325
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:08,803
<i>- Let's go.
- What about Six?</i>

326
00:16:09,367 --> 00:16:11,562
<i>Nine? Thirteen?
Thirteen is no good.</i>

327
00:16:11,727 --> 00:16:13,843
<i>Fourteen. Fourteen.</i>

328
00:16:19,087 --> 00:16:21,396
<i>Are you okay, Jerry?
You seem quiet.</i>

329
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:24,361
<i>No, I'm just a little worn-out.</i>

330
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:27,798
<i>- I know exactly what you mean.
- Oh, I'm sure you do.</i>

331
00:16:28,007 --> 00:16:30,282
<i>What in God's name
is going on here?</i>

332
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:32,642
<i>Is she wearing the same thing
over and over again?</i>

333
00:16:32,807 --> 00:16:35,275
<i>Or does she have a c/oset fu/
of these /ik e Superman?</i>

334
00:16:35,447 --> 00:16:37,642
<i>I've got to un/ock this mystery.</i>

335
00:16:37,807 --> 00:16:39,877
Oh, my God.

336
00:16:40,927 --> 00:16:43,725
<i>I can't go to the movies like this.</i>

337
00:16:44,887 --> 00:16:47,321
<i>Do you mind if we go back
to my apartment so I can change?</i>

338
00:16:47,847 --> 00:16:51,886
<i>Change? Yes, I think
that's a super idea.</i>

339
00:16:53,647 --> 00:16:56,525
<i>- Are we almost there?
- Just keep breathing, okay?</i>

340
00:16:56,687 --> 00:16:58,405
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.

341
00:16:58,567 --> 00:17:02,606
<i>You know, the thing is, I kind
of promised the widow Mantle...</i>

342
00:17:02,767 --> 00:17:04,644
<i>...that I would name my baby Seven.</i>

343
00:17:04,807 --> 00:17:07,321
<i>Now's not the best time, George.</i>

344
00:17:08,567 --> 00:17:10,876
<i>It's just that I know her.
And, boy-</i>

345
00:17:11,047 --> 00:17:12,924
<i>George, she's in labour.</i>

346
00:17:13,807 --> 00:17:15,559
So am I.

347
00:17:18,647 --> 00:17:23,675
<i>Well, you both presented
very convincing arguments.</i>

348
00:17:24,007 --> 00:17:26,123
<i>On the one hand, Elaine...</i>

349
00:17:26,287 --> 00:17:28,721
<i>...your promise was given in haste.</i>

350
00:17:28,927 --> 00:17:31,122
<i>But was it not still a promise?</i>

351
00:17:32,807 --> 00:17:37,085
<i>And, Kramer, you did provide a
service in exchange for compensation.</i>

352
00:17:37,247 --> 00:17:40,876
<i>But does the fee, once paid,
not entitle the buyer...</i>

353
00:17:41,047 --> 00:17:44,323
<i>...to some assurance
of reliability?</i>

354
00:17:46,247 --> 00:17:50,365
<i>These were not easy questions
to answer.</i>

355
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:51,880
Not for any man.

356
00:17:52,367 --> 00:17:54,927
<i>But I have made a decision.</i>

357
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:58,638
<i>We will cut the bike
down the middle...</i>

358
00:17:58,807 --> 00:18:00,718
<i>...and give half to each of you.</i>

359
00:18:00,927 --> 00:18:02,963
What? This is your solution?

360
00:18:03,127 --> 00:18:04,845
<i>To ruin the bike?</i>

361
00:18:05,007 --> 00:18:07,396
<i>All right. Fine, fine.
Go ahead.</i>

362
00:18:07,567 --> 00:18:10,445
<i>- Cut the stupid thing in half.
- No, no, no. Give it to her.</i>

363
00:18:10,607 --> 00:18:12,916
<i>I'd rather it belong to another
than see it destroyed.</i>

364
00:18:13,087 --> 00:18:14,918
<i>Newman, give it to her.
I beg you.</i>

365
00:18:15,087 --> 00:18:18,443
<i>- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Not so fast, Elaine.</i>

366
00:18:18,607 --> 00:18:20,279
<i>Only the bike's true owner...</i>

367
00:18:20,447 --> 00:18:23,200
<i>...would rather give it away
than see it come to harm.</i>

368
00:18:23,367 --> 00:18:25,881
<i>- Kramer, the bike is yours.
- What?</i>

369
00:18:26,047 --> 00:18:29,084
<i>Sweet justice.
Newman, you are wise.</i>

370
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,646
But this isn't fair.

371
00:18:30,847 --> 00:18:33,998
<i>Lookit, my neck is still hurting me.
And now you have the bike?</i>

372
00:18:34,207 --> 00:18:35,720
<i>Well, tell it to the judge, honey.</i>

373
00:18:36,367 --> 00:18:38,676
<i>I'm going for a ride.</i>

374
00:18:39,807 --> 00:18:41,081
<i>Here we are.</i>

375
00:18:41,727 --> 00:18:44,719
<i>So this is the fortress of solitude.</i>

376
00:18:45,807 --> 00:18:47,240
<i>Well, I guess I'll go change.</i>

377
00:18:47,447 --> 00:18:51,281
<i>Yes, change. By all means, change.</i>

378
00:19:03,087 --> 00:19:04,759
<i>August 17 th, 1992.</i>

379
00:19:04,967 --> 00:19:06,446
<i>The same dress.</i>

380
00:19:06,607 --> 00:19:09,644
<i>She never changes. Oh, my God.</i>

381
00:19:09,927 --> 00:19:12,236
<i>She's gotta have hundreds
of these dresses.</i>

382
00:19:12,407 --> 00:19:15,240
<i>There must be a secret stash
around here somewhere.</i>

383
00:19:20,247 --> 00:19:22,841
<i>- Are you looking for something?
- I thought you were changing.</i>

384
00:19:23,047 --> 00:19:25,436
<i>You know, maybe we should
just call it a night.</i>

385
00:19:25,647 --> 00:19:27,877
<i>No, no, no. Come on.
Put something else on.</i>

386
00:19:28,047 --> 00:19:29,446
<i>It's early. Let's go out.</i>

387
00:19:29,887 --> 00:19:32,082
<i>I think I'm just gonna go to bed.</i>

388
00:19:33,327 --> 00:19:36,922
<i>You know, I'm kind of tired myself.
I'll just sleep here on the couch.</i>

389
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:40,477
<i>In the morning, we'll walk out together.
Both dressed, different clothes.</i>

390
00:19:40,687 --> 00:19:41,915
<i>I'll be in the same clothes.</i>

391
00:19:42,087 --> 00:19:44,237
<i>You'll be in different clothes,
as it's your place.</i>

392
00:19:44,407 --> 00:19:47,080
<i>We'll go down. Me in my same
clothes, you in different clothes.</i>

393
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:49,164
<i>Jerry, I don't think so.</i>

394
00:19:51,047 --> 00:19:52,639
<i>- Wanna throw something on,
walk me...</i>

395
00:19:52,847 --> 00:19:54,166
<i>- ... to a cab?
- Get out.</i>

396
00:19:54,327 --> 00:19:57,524
<i>Tell me what you're wearing tomorrow.
I'll help you lay it out on the bed.</i>

397
00:19:59,967 --> 00:20:03,039
<i>- Okay, breathe, honey. Breathe.
- You're really being very selfish.</i>

398
00:20:03,247 --> 00:20:05,522
<i>Be nice if you'd think
of someone other than yourself.</i>

399
00:20:05,687 --> 00:20:07,882
<i>- I'm having a baby.
- You're not getting Seven.</i>

400
00:20:08,047 --> 00:20:10,163
<i>- Now, get out of here.
- Please, I have so little.</i>

401
00:20:10,327 --> 00:20:12,477
- I'm sorry, sir. Family only.
- I'm family.

402
00:20:12,647 --> 00:20:14,444
<i>I'm having sex with the cousin.</i>

403
00:20:14,607 --> 00:20:18,520
<i>Seven! Seven!</i>

404
00:20:19,847 --> 00:20:23,123
<i>Hello, Christie. I was wondering
if we could get together again.</i>

405
00:20:23,407 --> 00:20:24,920
<i>Oh, really?</i>

406
00:20:25,087 --> 00:20:27,043
<i>You can't break up
with me over the phone.</i>

407
00:20:27,247 --> 00:20:29,886
<i>You gotta do this in person.
It doesn't have to be one-on-one.</i>

408
00:20:30,047 --> 00:20:32,038
<i>Bring a group of friends.
I just wanna see you.</i>

409
00:20:32,207 --> 00:20:35,563
<i>Don't hang up on me. Why do you
always wear the same dress? Hello?</i>

410
00:20:37,367 --> 00:20:39,437
<i>Jerry, if you're gonna be
snacking on these...</i>

411
00:20:39,607 --> 00:20:41,677
<i>...you can't expect me to pay
for the whole box.</i>

412
00:20:42,167 --> 00:20:44,283
<i>All right, Hobo Joe.</i>

413
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,477
<i>I didn't wanna put a damper
on your smorgasbord.</i>

414
00:20:47,647 --> 00:20:50,719
<i>But it's the end of the week,
so I added up your tab.</i>

415
00:20:52,327 --> 00:20:54,079
<i>I know, pretty steep.</i>

416
00:20:54,247 --> 00:20:55,919
<i>Well, I don't have this kind of cash.</i>

417
00:20:56,127 --> 00:20:59,119
<i>- Few do.
- I'm good for it.</i>

418
00:20:59,327 --> 00:21:02,444
<i>Yeah, well, until this bill is paid,
the food court is closed.</i>

419
00:21:02,607 --> 00:21:05,201
<i>Closed? All right.</i>

420
00:21:05,367 --> 00:21:09,155
<i>I'll get that money for you in five
minutes. And don't eat any more.</i>

421
00:21:12,807 --> 00:21:14,035
<i>Hey, that's my bike.</i>

422
00:21:16,247 --> 00:21:18,238
<i>- Gangway.
- This is my bike.</i>

423
00:21:18,447 --> 00:21:21,120
<i>Oh, no. No, no, no.
I bought it from Kramer.</i>

424
00:21:21,567 --> 00:21:23,080
<i>He was hard up for cash.</i>

425
00:21:23,247 --> 00:21:25,761
<i>Fifty bucks. Can you believe it?</i>

426
00:21:26,447 --> 00:21:28,199
<i>I had to make some
minor modifications.</i>

427
00:21:28,567 --> 00:21:30,558
<i>Solid tires, reinforced seat post...</i>

428
00:21:30,767 --> 00:21:33,998
<i>...heavy-duty shocks.
But, baby, this is one sweet ride.</i>

429
00:21:34,207 --> 00:21:36,926
<i>No, you gotta give me back that bike.
Newman, give it.</i>

430
00:21:37,287 --> 00:21:39,403
<i>Elaine, Elaine.
Help me. Help me.</i>

431
00:21:39,567 --> 00:21:41,637
<i>Help. Help. Help.</i>
