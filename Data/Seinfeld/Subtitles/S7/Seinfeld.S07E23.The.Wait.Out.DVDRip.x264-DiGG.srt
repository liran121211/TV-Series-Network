1
00:00:04,527 --> 00:00:06,279
<i>The concept of being separated
is strange.</i>

2
00:00:06,447 --> 00:00:08,278
<i>It's like you're engaged
to be divorced.</i>

3
00:00:08,447 --> 00:00:11,484
<i>"We're gonna try and make
not being together work.</i>

4
00:00:11,647 --> 00:00:14,286
<i>First we were separated, then we met,
then we were together.</i>

5
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:16,358
<i>Now we're gonna try
being separated again.</i>

6
00:00:16,527 --> 00:00:19,963
<i>We think actually some sort of giant
rubber band might be the solution."</i>

7
00:00:20,127 --> 00:00:21,879
<i>Of course, when you were
a kid in school...</i>

8
00:00:22,047 --> 00:00:24,242
<i>...you'd get separated
for having too good a time.</i>

9
00:00:24,407 --> 00:00:26,682
"If you two kids don't stop laughing
and having fun...

10
00:00:26,847 --> 00:00:28,678
<i>...I'm gonna have to separate you."</i>

11
00:00:29,367 --> 00:00:31,642
<i>Then the kid finds out his parents
are breaking up...</i>

12
00:00:31,807 --> 00:00:35,561
<i>...thinks it's because they got caught
fooling around, which is probably true.</i>

13
00:00:42,287 --> 00:00:44,118
<i>- Hairdo?
- Yeah.</i>

14
00:00:44,287 --> 00:00:46,482
<i>You look like Brenda Starr.</i>

15
00:00:47,207 --> 00:00:49,801
<i>- Is that good?
- Better than Dondi.</i>

16
00:00:51,407 --> 00:00:53,398
<i>Hey, my God, look at that.</i>

17
00:00:53,567 --> 00:00:55,159
<i>It's David and Beth Lukner.</i>

18
00:00:55,327 --> 00:00:58,842
<i>You know, I heard a rumour
their marriage is a little rocky.</i>

19
00:00:59,007 --> 00:01:01,885
<i>Really? You know, I have
a little thing for Beth Lukner.</i>

20
00:01:02,047 --> 00:01:03,400
<i>Well...</i>

21
00:01:03,567 --> 00:01:08,197
<i>I have to admit I've always thought
David was kind of sponge-worthy.</i>

22
00:01:09,487 --> 00:01:12,559
<i>Yeah, I've been waiting out
their marriage for three years.</i>

23
00:01:12,727 --> 00:01:15,321
<i>Me too. Well, I've been waiting out
two or three marriages...</i>

24
00:01:15,487 --> 00:01:17,682
<i>...but this is the one I really
had my eye on.</i>

25
00:01:18,727 --> 00:01:21,878
<i>This car out there is taking up
like three parking spaces.</i>

26
00:01:22,047 --> 00:01:23,639
<i>That's mine.</i>

27
00:01:24,007 --> 00:01:27,079
<i>- You have a car?
- My friend lent it to me for the week.</i>

28
00:01:27,247 --> 00:01:29,238
<i>- She's out of town.
- I've never seen you drive.</i>

29
00:01:29,407 --> 00:01:30,999
<i>- Me neither.
- Jerry?</i>

30
00:01:31,167 --> 00:01:34,000
<i>- Elaine, hi.
- Hi, David.</i>

31
00:01:34,167 --> 00:01:35,316
<i>Hi, Beth.</i>

32
00:01:36,127 --> 00:01:38,322
<i>Oh, George,
this is my husband, David.</i>

33
00:01:38,487 --> 00:01:39,806
<i>- Oh, hi, David.
- Hello.</i>

34
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:42,435
<i>George, you're the one who works
for the Yankees, right?</i>

35
00:01:42,607 --> 00:01:43,926
<i>Yeah. Why, what do you do?</i>

36
00:01:44,087 --> 00:01:47,238
<i>Well, I sell insurance, but Beth
used to be Don Mattingly's doctor.</i>

37
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:48,601
<i>- Really?
- Yeah.</i>

38
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,956
<i>A physician married to a salesman.</i>

39
00:01:52,127 --> 00:01:55,039
<i>I gotta tell you, Beth, you could have
done a lot better than him.</i>

40
00:02:03,647 --> 00:02:05,558
<i>- Hey.
- Hey. Hey, Mickey, what's going on?</i>

41
00:02:05,727 --> 00:02:08,480
<i>I'm nervous. I'm auditioning to be
in the Actors Studio tonight.</i>

42
00:02:08,647 --> 00:02:12,435
<i>- Really?
- It's Method, Jerry. It's intense.</i>

43
00:02:12,607 --> 00:02:14,563
<i>- Kramer's my scene partner.
- Kramer?</i>

44
00:02:14,727 --> 00:02:16,126
<i>He doesn't have to say anything.</i>

45
00:02:16,287 --> 00:02:18,403
<i>He just has to sit there.
I'm playing a detective.</i>

46
00:02:18,567 --> 00:02:20,523
<i>I'm playing a businessman
accused of murder.</i>

47
00:02:20,687 --> 00:02:22,040
Oh, boy.

48
00:02:22,207 --> 00:02:24,243
<i>I gotta meet Elaine
and run some errands, so...</i>

49
00:02:24,767 --> 00:02:26,120
<i>Look at this, Mickey.</i>

50
00:02:26,287 --> 00:02:27,640
<i>These pants are falling apart.</i>

51
00:02:27,807 --> 00:02:30,162
<i>When I met you, you used
to wear jeans all the time.</i>

52
00:02:30,327 --> 00:02:31,885
<i>Well, I was a different man then.</i>

53
00:02:32,047 --> 00:02:34,038
<i>With a different body.</i>

54
00:02:34,927 --> 00:02:40,240
<i>Hey, I got the body of a taut,
preteen Swedish boy.</i>

55
00:02:42,127 --> 00:02:43,958
I don't know.

56
00:02:44,127 --> 00:02:47,244
<i>What are you thinking? You think that
I'm not able to wear jeans anymore?</i>

57
00:02:47,407 --> 00:02:50,843
<i>Is that what you're saying?
Because I'll go and I'll buy some jeans.</i>

58
00:02:52,247 --> 00:02:54,317
<i>I swear to God, I will.</i>

59
00:02:54,767 --> 00:02:56,359
<i>Don't think I won't, Jerry.</i>

60
00:02:58,367 --> 00:03:00,597
All right. That's it.

61
00:03:03,167 --> 00:03:05,806
<i>God, it is so great to drive again.</i>

62
00:03:05,967 --> 00:03:08,322
I miss it so much.

63
00:03:08,927 --> 00:03:12,283
<i>How about a left turn signal,
you moron!</i>

64
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:15,285
<i>I'm so nauseous.</i>

65
00:03:15,447 --> 00:03:16,926
<i>She's the worst driver.</i>

66
00:03:17,087 --> 00:03:20,682
<i>You know what,
on my first road test, I hit a dog.</i>

67
00:03:22,167 --> 00:03:23,646
<i>I think it was a golden retriever.</i>

68
00:03:23,807 --> 00:03:25,718
<i>No, no, no, it was a yellow lab.</i>

69
00:03:26,727 --> 00:03:28,922
<i>I gotta check my messages.</i>

70
00:03:31,327 --> 00:03:32,726
<i>Hey.</i>

71
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:35,278
<i>I'm so carsick I'm gonna v omit.</i>

72
00:03:35,967 --> 00:03:37,161
<i>Oh, my God, Jerry.</i>

73
00:03:38,047 --> 00:03:39,799
<i>My friend Kim called.</i>

74
00:03:39,967 --> 00:03:42,037
<i>David and Beth
got separated last night.</i>

75
00:03:42,207 --> 00:03:44,926
<i>- Yeah?
- They're getting divorced!</i>

76
00:03:50,567 --> 00:03:52,717
<i>So now, what is our move?
What do we do?</i>

77
00:03:52,887 --> 00:03:54,684
<i>I don't know,
but we don't have much time.</i>

78
00:03:54,847 --> 00:03:57,077
<i>City's teeming with people
waiting out that marriage.</i>

79
00:03:57,247 --> 00:03:58,521
Right.

80
00:03:58,687 --> 00:04:01,155
<i>It's like when a tenant dies
in a rent-controlled building.</i>

81
00:04:01,327 --> 00:04:02,999
<i>You gotta take immediate action.</i>

82
00:04:03,407 --> 00:04:05,841
<i>But David and Beth are gonna need
their grieving time.</i>

83
00:04:06,007 --> 00:04:08,646
<i>Their grieving time is a luxury
I can't afford.</i>

84
00:04:08,807 --> 00:04:11,367
<i>I'm calling Beth tonight,
and if you want a shot at David...</i>

85
00:04:11,527 --> 00:04:13,085
<i>- ... I suggest you do likewise.
- Yeah.</i>

86
00:04:13,247 --> 00:04:15,920
<i>But we gotta make it seem like
we're not calling for dates.</i>

87
00:04:16,087 --> 00:04:17,725
<i>Then why are we calling?</i>

88
00:04:18,447 --> 00:04:21,359
<i>- Good question. Why are we calling?
- Why are we calling?</i>

89
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:25,566
<i>- Calling, calling, calling.
- Why are we calling? Why do we call?</i>

90
00:04:27,487 --> 00:04:29,478
<i>I got it. I've got it.</i>

91
00:04:29,647 --> 00:04:32,764
<i>We're calling just to say:</i>

92
00:04:32,927 --> 00:04:35,885
<i>"I'm there for you."</i>

93
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,046
<i>I'm there for you.</i>

94
00:04:38,207 --> 00:04:41,756
<i>Then, after a period
of being there for you...</i>

95
00:04:41,927 --> 00:04:46,364
<i>...we slowly remove
the two words "for you"...</i>

96
00:04:46,527 --> 00:04:50,202
<i>...and we're just there.</i>

97
00:04:51,247 --> 00:04:52,441
<i>- Hey.
- Hey.</i>

98
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,359
<i>Remember Beth and David
from yesterday?</i>

99
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:56,597
<i>- They got separated.
- Really?</i>

100
00:04:57,607 --> 00:05:01,077
<i>Well, you don't think it had anything
to do with what I said, do you?</i>

101
00:05:02,807 --> 00:05:03,956
What did you say?

102
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:07,199
<i>You know, that thing
about her being too good for him.</i>

103
00:05:07,367 --> 00:05:10,962
<i>I mean, I was just being folksy.
They could tell I was being folksy?</i>

104
00:05:11,127 --> 00:05:14,005
<i>- Yeah, I thought you were being folksy.
- Totally folksy.</i>

105
00:05:40,047 --> 00:05:41,878
<i>Hey...</i>

106
00:05:45,247 --> 00:05:46,999
<i>- What did you get?
- I bought dungarees.</i>

107
00:05:48,087 --> 00:05:50,203
<i>Kramer, they're painted on.</i>

108
00:05:51,247 --> 00:05:52,919
<i>Well, they're the slim fit.</i>

109
00:05:54,007 --> 00:05:55,725
<i>- Slim fit?
- Yeah, they're streamlined.</i>

110
00:05:56,287 --> 00:05:58,596
<i>You're walking like Frankenstein.</i>

111
00:05:59,527 --> 00:06:02,246
<i>They just gotta be worked in
a little bit, that's all.</i>

112
00:06:03,367 --> 00:06:04,846
<i>See you.</i>

113
00:06:07,487 --> 00:06:10,843
<i>Well, David, it happens.</i>

114
00:06:11,007 --> 00:06:13,805
<i>Sure, Beth, these things happen.</i>

115
00:06:13,967 --> 00:06:17,084
<i>So have you told many people yet?</i>

116
00:06:17,247 --> 00:06:19,920
<i>Because it's really
nobody's business.</i>

117
00:06:20,087 --> 00:06:22,647
<i>Anyway, I just called
to tell you that...</i>

118
00:06:22,807 --> 00:06:24,763
<i>...I'm there for you.</i>

119
00:06:25,247 --> 00:06:27,442
<i>There is...</i>

120
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,447
<i>...anywhere you want me to be.</i>

121
00:06:30,607 --> 00:06:32,279
<i>Sure. Dinner would be fine.</i>

122
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:36,281
<i>And I can just be there for you.</i>

123
00:06:37,367 --> 00:06:39,119
<i>- Jerry, you gotta help me.
- What's wrong?</i>

124
00:06:39,287 --> 00:06:42,006
<i>I can't get my pants off.
Mickey's audition is in 20 minutes.</i>

125
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:44,522
<i>I'm supposed to be a businessman.
I gotta be in costume.</i>

126
00:06:44,687 --> 00:06:46,996
<i>All right. Undo them,
I'll help you get them off.</i>

127
00:06:47,167 --> 00:06:50,204
<i>- I already did, and it won't come off.
- You just gotta wiggle your hips.</i>

128
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,925
Pull down.

129
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,845
All right. All right.
That's no good.

130
00:06:56,007 --> 00:06:57,963
<i>Let me try getting them
from the bottom.</i>

131
00:06:58,127 --> 00:06:59,640
<i>Just give me...</i>

132
00:06:59,807 --> 00:07:02,367
<i>Wait. Jerry, wait a minute.</i>

133
00:07:02,527 --> 00:07:04,677
<i>Man, these are tight.</i>

134
00:07:04,847 --> 00:07:07,680
- Squinch your hips in.
- I am squinching my hips.

135
00:07:07,887 --> 00:07:09,320
<i>Keep squinching them.</i>

136
00:07:12,207 --> 00:07:14,596
All right, that's not gonna work.
That's not gonna work.

137
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,997
<i>Let me just think for a second here.</i>

138
00:07:17,167 --> 00:07:19,203
<i>You better get me.</i>

139
00:07:23,207 --> 00:07:25,163
<i>Get me up, get me up.</i>

140
00:07:25,327 --> 00:07:26,999
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

141
00:07:27,167 --> 00:07:30,204
<i>Look, you're gonna need the
Jaws of Life to get out of those things.</i>

142
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,005
<i>I don't have time.
I'm gonna be late.</i>

143
00:07:32,167 --> 00:07:35,159
<i>- Maybe you could soak in a tub.
- You better get the door.</i>

144
00:07:45,807 --> 00:07:47,160
<i>It was nice to get your call.</i>

145
00:07:47,487 --> 00:07:50,524
<i>Well, I just want you to know
I'm there for you.</i>

146
00:07:50,767 --> 00:07:52,246
<i>Of course, now I'm here for you...</i>

147
00:07:52,407 --> 00:07:54,637
<i>...but when I'm not here for you,
I'm there for you.</i>

148
00:07:55,327 --> 00:07:58,205
<i>Well, wherever you are,
I appreciate it.</i>

149
00:07:58,367 --> 00:07:59,641
<i>So how did this all happen?</i>

150
00:08:00,207 --> 00:08:03,961
<i>Well, actually, it had a lot to do
with George's comment.</i>

151
00:08:06,287 --> 00:08:09,723
<i>- Is that right?
- I thought maybe I could do better.</i>

152
00:08:10,927 --> 00:08:12,360
<i>Maybe, maybe.</i>

153
00:08:12,527 --> 00:08:14,006
<i>Well, it wasn't just that.</i>

154
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:15,964
<i>I realized after
three years of marriage...</i>

155
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:18,516
<i>...that David's little quirks
were getting on my nerves.</i>

156
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:21,804
<i>Three years is a long time
to be married.</i>

157
00:08:24,927 --> 00:08:29,000
<i>In the middle of our fight last night,
he did this thing that he always does...</i>

158
00:08:29,167 --> 00:08:32,000
<i>...where he asks questions
to himself aloud...</i>

159
00:08:32,167 --> 00:08:33,361
<i>...and then answers them.</i>

160
00:08:33,527 --> 00:08:36,917
<i>Am I happy Beth left me?
Of course not.</i>

161
00:08:37,087 --> 00:08:39,806
<i>Can I hope to pick up the pieces
and move on? Absolutely.</i>

162
00:08:40,367 --> 00:08:42,642
<i>You're gonna pick up the pieces.</i>

163
00:08:42,807 --> 00:08:44,843
<i>We just had
our third anniversary on April 8th.</i>

164
00:08:45,007 --> 00:08:45,962
<i>- Tenth.
- Right.</i>

165
00:08:46,127 --> 00:08:47,401
Right.

166
00:08:49,247 --> 00:08:53,718
<i>You know, as far as I'm concerned,
this whole thing is George's fault.</i>

167
00:08:53,887 --> 00:08:57,562
<i>Well, David, the thing
about George is that...</i>

168
00:08:57,727 --> 00:08:59,957
<i>...he's an idiot.</i>

169
00:09:02,647 --> 00:09:05,480
<i>All right. Auditioning next
is Mickey Abbott...</i>

170
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,477
<i>...doing a scene from
the Terence Klufer play...</i>

171
00:09:09,647 --> 00:09:11,000
<i>...Flesh Wounds in Ithaca.</i>

172
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:15,796
<i>I'm sorry, my scene partner
isn't here yet so I guess-</i>

173
00:09:18,527 --> 00:09:20,165
<i>- Sorry I'm late.
- What's with the jeans?</i>

174
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:21,840
<i>- You're a businessman.
- Long story.</i>

175
00:09:22,007 --> 00:09:23,804
<i>Well, just get up here.</i>

176
00:09:32,607 --> 00:09:35,644
<i>So, Bradley...</i>

177
00:09:35,807 --> 00:09:38,605
<i>...I guess this is the last place
you expected to find yourself.</i>

178
00:09:38,767 --> 00:09:41,725
<i>Well, we're gonna be here a while,
so take a seat.</i>

179
00:09:48,047 --> 00:09:50,356
<i>If it hadn't been
for that secretary of yours...</i>

180
00:09:50,887 --> 00:09:52,240
I said, sit down.

181
00:09:54,767 --> 00:09:57,406
<i>Are you deaf, Bradley?
I said, sit down.</i>

182
00:09:59,927 --> 00:10:03,363
<i>Bradley, it's very important
that you sit down.</i>

183
00:10:04,967 --> 00:10:06,639
<i>Now, for the last time...</i>

184
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:10,686
...try again to sit down!

185
00:10:10,847 --> 00:10:13,566
<i>Sit down, you big, stupid ape!</i>

186
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,927
<i>Did I have a great time with
David Lukner last night?</i>

187
00:10:21,367 --> 00:10:22,516
<i>I sure did.</i>

188
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,243
<i>Do I think there's a future here?</i>

189
00:10:26,407 --> 00:10:28,079
<i>I don't see why not.</i>

190
00:10:28,247 --> 00:10:33,640
<i>I'll tell you, that "there for you"crap
was a stroke of genius.</i>

191
00:10:34,527 --> 00:10:36,483
<i>- Oh, please.
- Never mind.</i>

192
00:10:36,647 --> 00:10:37,921
<i>- Oh, come on.
- You're a genius.</i>

193
00:10:38,087 --> 00:10:39,440
All right.

194
00:10:40,367 --> 00:10:41,880
<i>Hey.</i>

195
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,515
<i>- Georgie!
- Hey, there he is!</i>

196
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:46,917
<i>Georgie boy!</i>

197
00:10:49,447 --> 00:10:50,926
- What's going on?
- What's going on?

198
00:10:51,087 --> 00:10:53,237
<i>You're the man of the hour,
that's what's going on.</i>

199
00:10:53,407 --> 00:10:54,681
<i>- Right.
- What do you mean?</i>

200
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:58,078
<i>Well, thanks to you and your little
comment there to David and Beth...</i>

201
00:10:58,247 --> 00:11:00,761
<i>...Jerry and I
are in prime pouncing position...</i>

202
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:05,364
<i>...to scoop these two up
before they know what hit them.</i>

203
00:11:08,247 --> 00:11:10,158
<i>So it was my comment
that broke them up?</i>

204
00:11:10,367 --> 00:11:12,119
<i>- According to them.
- Yeah.</i>

205
00:11:12,287 --> 00:11:14,243
<i>I feel terrible.</i>

206
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:17,080
<i>I can't be responsible
for breaking up a marriage.</i>

207
00:11:17,247 --> 00:11:18,600
<i>- Oh, no.
- Where are you going?</i>

208
00:11:18,767 --> 00:11:20,359
<i>Well, I gotta go talk to Beth.</i>

209
00:11:20,527 --> 00:11:22,438
<i>- Talk to Beth?
- I gotta undo what I did.</i>

210
00:11:22,607 --> 00:11:24,757
<i>You're not undoing anything.</i>

211
00:11:24,927 --> 00:11:26,918
<i>- Oh, yes, I am.
- Oh, no, you're not.</i>

212
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:28,759
<i>All right, get out of my way.</i>

213
00:11:31,207 --> 00:11:33,801
<i>All right, don't make me
get physical here!</i>

214
00:11:35,007 --> 00:11:36,725
<i>You be careful, George.</i>

215
00:11:48,447 --> 00:11:51,325
<i>- George.
- Hi, Beth.</i>

216
00:11:56,527 --> 00:11:58,882
<i>Anyway, Jerry told me that...</i>

217
00:11:59,047 --> 00:12:02,517
<i>...it might have been my comment
in the coffee shop that broke you up.</i>

218
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:05,365
<i>Well, you know,
it's funny, George...</i>

219
00:12:05,527 --> 00:12:08,280
<i>...sometimes you don't know
how you're feeling about something...</i>

220
00:12:08,447 --> 00:12:11,484
<i>...until a person like you comes along
and articulates it so perfectly.</i>

221
00:12:12,287 --> 00:12:14,039
<i>Articulate?</i>

222
00:12:14,487 --> 00:12:18,366
<i>Me? I've never articulated anything.
I'm completely incoherent.</i>

223
00:12:18,927 --> 00:12:20,599
I don't know about that.

224
00:12:20,767 --> 00:12:23,361
<i>Hold on. Hello.</i>

225
00:12:23,527 --> 00:12:24,960
Hi.

226
00:12:25,127 --> 00:12:28,119
<i>Yeah, last night. I did too.</i>

227
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:31,165
<i>Really? That's so funny,
he's here right now.</i>

228
00:12:31,327 --> 00:12:33,079
<i>Can you put him on?
I'd love to say hello.</i>

229
00:12:33,247 --> 00:12:35,920
<i>Sure. George, it's Jerry.</i>

230
00:12:36,127 --> 00:12:37,958
<i>- He wants to talk to me?
- Yeah.</i>

231
00:12:38,127 --> 00:12:41,244
<i>- He says he wants to say hello.
- Sweet guy.</i>

232
00:12:46,847 --> 00:12:48,439
<i>Hello?</i>

233
00:12:48,847 --> 00:12:50,485
<i>What the hell are you doing
over there?</i>

234
00:12:50,647 --> 00:12:53,081
<i>Mind your own business.
Now, stay out of my affairs!</i>

235
00:12:53,247 --> 00:12:55,078
<i>Jerry, Jerry,
that is so sweet of you...</i>

236
00:12:55,247 --> 00:12:57,238
<i>...but actually, I already ate.</i>

237
00:12:57,407 --> 00:12:59,159
<i>Ate? What the hell
are you talking about?</i>

238
00:12:59,327 --> 00:13:01,124
<i>Listen to me.
Get out of that apartment.</i>

239
00:13:01,327 --> 00:13:04,956
<i>- If you screw this up for me, I swear-
- Chocolate chip mint?</i>

240
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,477
<i>Actually, Jerry,
I prefer chocolate chip.</i>

241
00:13:08,647 --> 00:13:10,842
<i>What is it about the chocolate
and the mint...</i>

242
00:13:11,007 --> 00:13:13,202
<i>...that makes it go so well together?</i>

243
00:13:13,647 --> 00:13:16,445
<i>- What are you talking about?
- Oh, of course you can use it. Sure.</i>

244
00:13:16,607 --> 00:13:20,043
<i>- Okay. Bye-bye.
- Don't hang up on me, George, I-</i>

245
00:13:24,807 --> 00:13:26,763
<i>- Hey.
- Hey.</i>

246
00:13:26,927 --> 00:13:29,202
<i>Are you still wearing those things?</i>

247
00:13:29,367 --> 00:13:30,516
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

248
00:13:30,687 --> 00:13:33,247
<i>Yeah, I think they're starting
to loosen up a bit.</i>

249
00:13:35,487 --> 00:13:38,047
<i>- Oh, hi, Mrs. Zanfino.
- Kramer, would you do me a favour?</i>

250
00:13:38,207 --> 00:13:41,244
<i>My babysitter hasn't shown up.
Could you watch Joey for an hour?</i>

251
00:13:41,407 --> 00:13:42,442
<i>Yeah, sure, Mrs. Zanfino.</i>

252
00:13:42,607 --> 00:13:45,201
<i>He's sleeping already.
You don't have to do anything.</i>

253
00:13:46,527 --> 00:13:48,882
<i>- See you later, buddy.
- See you later.</i>

254
00:13:50,687 --> 00:13:52,598
<i>- Hello?
- Hi, Jerry. It's Beth.</i>

255
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,644
<i>- Oh, hi, Beth.
- Hi.</i>

256
00:13:54,847 --> 00:13:56,838
<i>I've been doing
a lot of thinking today...</i>

257
00:13:57,007 --> 00:13:59,760
<i>...and I don't know,
maybe I made a huge mistake.</i>

258
00:14:00,087 --> 00:14:03,159
<i>- George.
- I'm just feeling very confused.</i>

259
00:14:04,727 --> 00:14:07,799
- I'll call you back, okay?
- Okay.

260
00:14:08,767 --> 00:14:09,836
<i>- Trouble.
- What?</i>

261
00:14:10,007 --> 00:14:11,326
<i>- George. Yeah.
- Is it? Damn.</i>

262
00:14:11,487 --> 00:14:12,920
<i>- What do we do?
- What do we do?</i>

263
00:14:13,087 --> 00:14:14,998
<i>You get your ass
over to Beth's tout de suite.</i>

264
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:17,635
<i>Turn on some of that so-called charm
you tell me about.</i>

265
00:14:17,967 --> 00:14:21,084
<i>- Yeah, I can try and do that.
- You don't try, you do it.</i>

266
00:14:21,247 --> 00:14:24,284
<i>I got the loser in this relationship.
I'm breathing new life into him.</i>

267
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:27,007
<i>Give me three more days,
he won't remember her name.</i>

268
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:28,680
<i>You got the winner, the easy part.</i>

269
00:14:28,887 --> 00:14:30,923
<i>Let's go. I'll drive you over there.
Come on.</i>

270
00:14:31,087 --> 00:14:33,920
<i>- You go on ahead. I'll take the bus.
- What? I'm parked outside.</i>

271
00:14:34,087 --> 00:14:36,521
<i>- I'll take the subway.
- It doesn't matter. I'll take you.</i>

272
00:14:36,687 --> 00:14:38,325
<i>- I can hitchhike.
- What's your problem?</i>

273
00:14:38,487 --> 00:14:40,523
<i>- It's really not necessary.
- What's your problem?</i>

274
00:14:55,207 --> 00:14:56,879
<i>The...</i>

275
00:14:57,047 --> 00:14:59,322
<i>The shoelaces
that you bought me...</i>

276
00:14:59,487 --> 00:15:01,398
<i>...they worked out well.</i>

277
00:15:02,447 --> 00:15:04,915
<i>Well, you know,
if you need some more...</i>

278
00:15:05,087 --> 00:15:07,078
<i>...I can get them for you.</i>

279
00:15:08,247 --> 00:15:10,636
<i>It should be a while, though.</i>

280
00:15:16,927 --> 00:15:18,804
<i>That was close.</i>

281
00:15:21,727 --> 00:15:23,319
<i>Confide in her. Open up to her.</i>

282
00:15:23,487 --> 00:15:24,681
<i>You know, women like that.</i>

283
00:15:25,087 --> 00:15:27,203
<i>I don't feel so good.</i>

284
00:15:27,967 --> 00:15:29,241
<i>Anyway, Beth...</i>

285
00:15:29,407 --> 00:15:31,318
<i>You know, I was thinking
on my way over...</i>

286
00:15:31,487 --> 00:15:34,684
<i>...how when I was 9,
I wanted these handball sneakers.</i>

287
00:15:34,847 --> 00:15:36,200
<i>They were all black.</i>

288
00:15:36,367 --> 00:15:38,756
<i>But they only came in adult sizes.</i>

289
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:43,925
<i>So, you know,
I never got the sneakers.</i>

290
00:15:45,927 --> 00:15:47,406
<i>Oh, really?</i>

291
00:15:47,567 --> 00:15:49,797
<i>My father left us when I was 9...</i>

292
00:15:49,967 --> 00:15:53,562
<i>...so I guess that's why
I have such a fear of abandonment.</i>

293
00:15:53,727 --> 00:15:56,844
<i>- Wow, that's so touching.
- Yes, it is.</i>

294
00:15:58,487 --> 00:16:00,921
<i>Hey, it's George.</i>

295
00:16:01,087 --> 00:16:03,396
<i>Oh, maybe we should go
someplace else.</i>

296
00:16:03,567 --> 00:16:04,761
<i>No, let's go in.</i>

297
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:12,636
<i>- Oh, hi. Hi, David.
- Hi, George.</i>

298
00:16:12,807 --> 00:16:14,763
<i>- Elaine.
- Hi.</i>

299
00:16:14,927 --> 00:16:18,044
<i>Listen, David, I want to apologize
about that comment-</i>

300
00:16:18,207 --> 00:16:20,437
<i>George, please, please. I'm fine.</i>

301
00:16:20,607 --> 00:16:22,199
<i>Oh, yeah, this is my fiancée.</i>

302
00:16:22,367 --> 00:16:24,005
- Susan, this is David.
- David.

303
00:16:24,207 --> 00:16:27,722
<i>Oh, fiancée? Boy, you could've
done a lot better than him.</i>

304
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:32,437
<i>Come on, Elaine, let's go.</i>

305
00:16:58,687 --> 00:17:01,281
<i>It's Frankenstein! It's Frankenstein!</i>

306
00:17:01,447 --> 00:17:02,960
<i>Joey.</i>

307
00:17:03,847 --> 00:17:05,041
<i>Joey.</i>

308
00:17:05,207 --> 00:17:10,042
<i>Mickey, you were so incredible
in that scene yesterday.</i>

309
00:17:10,207 --> 00:17:11,925
<i>- The rage.
- Right.</i>

310
00:17:12,087 --> 00:17:13,964
<i>The rage. Tons of rage.</i>

311
00:17:14,447 --> 00:17:16,324
<i>I don't believe this.</i>

312
00:17:22,287 --> 00:17:23,481
<i>- Hello.
- Mickey.</i>

313
00:17:23,647 --> 00:17:24,796
<i>Oh, hi, Kramer.</i>

314
00:17:24,967 --> 00:17:27,561
<i>- What do you want? I'm busy.
- You gotta do me a favour.</i>

315
00:17:27,727 --> 00:17:30,321
<i>- What? Now? I can't.
- Hey, you owe me.</i>

316
00:17:30,527 --> 00:17:31,880
<i>I got you in the Actors Studio.</i>

317
00:17:32,047 --> 00:17:33,719
<i>They thought what we did
was the scene.</i>

318
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:36,196
<i>All right, all right. I'll be right over.</i>

319
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:40,280
<i>You ready?</i>

320
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,684
<i>You know what, George...</i>

321
00:17:43,847 --> 00:17:45,678
<i>...why don't you go ahead.</i>

322
00:17:46,047 --> 00:17:48,607
<i>I think I'd like
to be alone for a while.</i>

323
00:17:49,207 --> 00:17:50,640
<i>Oh, sure.</i>

324
00:17:50,807 --> 00:17:53,321
<i>Sure, you want to be alone?
Sure, I understand that.</i>

325
00:17:53,487 --> 00:17:55,842
<i>You want a little time to think?
Think. Ponder things.</i>

326
00:17:56,007 --> 00:17:57,725
<i>You know, ruminate.</i>

327
00:17:57,887 --> 00:17:59,639
<i>You go ahead.
A lot of stuff on your mind.</i>

328
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,035
You think things out. Think.

329
00:18:01,207 --> 00:18:04,517
Mull, just mull. Do a lot of mulling.

330
00:18:05,807 --> 00:18:07,035
I gotta go find this kid.

331
00:18:07,207 --> 00:18:09,675
<i>All you gotta do is lay here
and pretend you're asleep...</i>

332
00:18:09,847 --> 00:18:11,644
<i>...in case she gets back.
Here, the covers.</i>

333
00:18:11,807 --> 00:18:14,037
<i>Why don't you just cut the pants
and get them off.</i>

334
00:18:14,207 --> 00:18:16,767
<i>- I'm breaking them in.
- What am I gonna do in here?</i>

335
00:18:16,927 --> 00:18:19,521
<i>Just keep the lights out
and your eyes closed. I'll be back.</i>

336
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:24,123
<i>Jerry, Jerry!</i>

337
00:18:24,607 --> 00:18:27,246
<i>Jerry, Jerry, the most
unbelievable thing has happened.</i>

338
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:28,556
<i>It is so unbelievable!</i>

339
00:18:28,727 --> 00:18:31,036
<i>I'm sitting in the coffee shop,
I'm talking to Susan...</i>

340
00:18:31,207 --> 00:18:32,925
<i>...we're talking
about shoelaces... right?</i>

341
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:37,000
<i>So in walks David, right?
He walks right up to the table, right?</i>

342
00:18:37,167 --> 00:18:39,806
<i>I introduce him to Susan,
and he says- Now, get this.</i>

343
00:18:39,967 --> 00:18:42,527
<i>He says, "Boy, you could do
a lot better than this guy."</i>

344
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:45,323
<i>He said the exact same thing
that I said to him...</i>

345
00:18:45,487 --> 00:18:46,681
<i>...just to get back at me.</i>

346
00:18:46,847 --> 00:18:51,557
<i>And then she says she wants
to be alone for a while. Alone, Jerry.</i>

347
00:18:51,727 --> 00:18:55,163
<i>I think that she thinks
that she could do better.</i>

348
00:18:55,327 --> 00:18:56,760
<i>Do you appreciate this?</i>

349
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,201
<i>You see the irony of this?</i>

350
00:18:58,367 --> 00:18:59,880
<i>You see what's going on here?</i>

351
00:19:00,407 --> 00:19:01,556
<i>What's the matter?</i>

352
00:19:01,727 --> 00:19:03,558
<i>I'm nauseous.</i>

353
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:05,319
<i>That what's hurting
your appreciation?</i>

354
00:19:05,487 --> 00:19:06,556
<i>A little.</i>

355
00:19:06,727 --> 00:19:08,240
It's a good story,
don't you think?

356
00:19:08,407 --> 00:19:09,396
<i>- It's not bad.
- Yeah.</i>

357
00:19:17,567 --> 00:19:19,797
<i>Joey, there you are. Hey, Joey!</i>

358
00:19:19,967 --> 00:19:21,559
<i>It's a monster!</i>

359
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,797
<i>I'm the babysitter.</i>

360
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:36,165
<i>Good night, honey.</i>

361
00:19:36,647 --> 00:19:38,160
Good night.

362
00:19:45,567 --> 00:19:48,035
<i>It's gotta have
something to do with Kramer.</i>

363
00:19:55,887 --> 00:19:57,081
<i>Elaine...</i>

364
00:19:58,167 --> 00:19:59,725
<i>...here's to you being there.</i>

365
00:19:59,887 --> 00:20:01,559
<i>And here.</i>

366
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,279
<i>Excuse me.</i>

367
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:10,199
<i>- Beth.
- David.</i>

368
00:20:18,567 --> 00:20:19,966
<i>I'll tell you, it's not bad.</i>

369
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,206
<i>- George?
- Yeah?</i>

370
00:20:41,367 --> 00:20:44,598
<i>- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Yeah, sure, sure.</i>

371
00:20:46,447 --> 00:20:49,086
<i>I've been doing a lot of thinking
about the wedding and all...</i>

372
00:20:54,647 --> 00:20:57,559
<i>...and I've decided
to go with the chicken.</i>

373
00:21:12,607 --> 00:21:16,486
<i>So chasing little kids, huh?
You're in a lot of trouble, mister.</i>

374
00:21:16,687 --> 00:21:19,155
<i>- No, look, I was babysitting-
- Yeah, yeah, all right.</i>

375
00:21:19,327 --> 00:21:20,885
Sit down.

376
00:21:25,727 --> 00:21:29,037
<i>What are you, deaf?
I said, sit down.</i>

377
00:21:32,687 --> 00:21:38,000
<i>- Hey, for the last time, sit down.
- Oh, yeah.</i>
