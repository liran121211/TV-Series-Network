1
00:00:02,697 --> 00:00:03,686
People can be so vain.

2
00:00:05,217 --> 00:00:07,685
I have a friend, wears eyeglasses,
no prescription...

3
00:00:07,857 --> 00:00:09,848
...because he thinks
he looks more intelligent.

4
00:00:10,017 --> 00:00:12,087
Now, why? Why do we think...

5
00:00:12,257 --> 00:00:14,817
...that glasses makes us look
more intelligent?

6
00:00:14,977 --> 00:00:18,014
Is it from the endless hours of reading
and studying and researching...

7
00:00:18,177 --> 00:00:20,816
...that this person supposedly
blew out their eyeballs?

8
00:00:20,977 --> 00:00:23,537
And that's why
they need the glasses?

9
00:00:23,697 --> 00:00:26,575
It's a corrective device. If you see
someone with a hearing aid...

10
00:00:26,737 --> 00:00:29,490
...you don't think, "Oh, they must
have been listening real good.

11
00:00:29,657 --> 00:00:33,616
Yeah, to a lot of important stuff."
No, they're deaf.

12
00:00:34,097 --> 00:00:35,416
They can't hear.

13
00:00:38,817 --> 00:00:40,535
- Hey, boys and girls.
- Hey.

14
00:00:40,697 --> 00:00:43,165
I need you both to sponsor me
in the AIDS Walk.

15
00:00:43,337 --> 00:00:46,807
- Isn't that tomorrow?
- Yeah, yeah. So get... Get...

16
00:00:46,977 --> 00:00:49,969
Well, I admire you for joining
the fight against AIDS.

17
00:00:50,137 --> 00:00:53,447
Yeah, well, if I didn't do something,
I wouldn't be able to live with myself.

18
00:00:53,617 --> 00:00:56,006
It's hard enough living next door.

19
00:00:56,377 --> 00:00:58,254
Some people,
they just wear a ribbon...

20
00:00:58,417 --> 00:01:00,533
...and they think they're
doing something. Not me.

21
00:01:00,697 --> 00:01:03,291
I talk the talk
and I walk the walk, baby.

22
00:01:04,577 --> 00:01:06,374
Yeah, I'm gonna be right back.

23
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,893
- New jeans?
- Yeah.

24
00:01:11,057 --> 00:01:13,696
- Still a 31 waist?
- Yep, since college.

25
00:01:15,017 --> 00:01:18,726
- Hey, Lena Small is on this list.
- Lena Small?

26
00:01:18,897 --> 00:01:23,209
Yeah, that girl I was gonna call
for a date, she was unlisted...

27
00:01:23,377 --> 00:01:26,369
...and now here's her number.
- Oh, you're not gonna...

28
00:01:26,537 --> 00:01:30,325
...cop a girl's phone number
off an AIDS charity list.

29
00:01:30,497 --> 00:01:34,172
Elaine, you should admire me.
I'm aspiring to date a giving person.

30
00:01:34,497 --> 00:01:36,931
- But you're a taking person.
- That's why I should date...

31
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,133
...a giving person.
If I date a taking person...

32
00:01:39,297 --> 00:01:42,494
... everyone's taking, taking, taking.
No one's giving. It's bedlam.

33
00:01:42,657 --> 00:01:44,613
She's gonna ask
how you got her number.

34
00:01:44,777 --> 00:01:48,133
Oh, I'll tell her I met some guy
who knew her and he gave it to me.

35
00:01:48,297 --> 00:01:50,492
- What's he look like?
- I didn't pay much attention.

36
00:01:50,657 --> 00:01:52,568
I'd just come
from buying a speedboat.

37
00:01:52,897 --> 00:01:55,695
- You're buying a speedboat?
- See, we're already off the subject...

38
00:01:55,857 --> 00:01:57,290
...of how I got her number.

39
00:01:57,457 --> 00:02:00,096
All I do is get past the first
phone call and I'm home free.

40
00:02:00,257 --> 00:02:02,373
- I don't know.
- Lf Billy got your number...

41
00:02:02,537 --> 00:02:05,210
...off the AIDS Walk list,
you wouldn't have gone out with him?

42
00:02:05,377 --> 00:02:06,651
- Well...
- Yeah.

43
00:02:07,097 --> 00:02:10,328
- So you really like this guy?
- Very much.

44
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:15,048
- How's the sexual chemistry?
- Haven't been in the lab yet.

45
00:02:15,857 --> 00:02:18,325
But I am
birth-control shopping today.

46
00:02:19,217 --> 00:02:21,890
- Are you still on the pill?
- Oh, Kramer...

47
00:02:22,057 --> 00:02:25,049
No, I think birth control should
be discussed in an open forum.

48
00:02:25,337 --> 00:02:27,328
- The Sponge, okay?
- Sponge?

49
00:02:27,497 --> 00:02:29,055
The Today Sponge.

50
00:02:29,537 --> 00:02:31,255
But wasn't that taken off
the market?

51
00:02:31,697 --> 00:02:34,211
Off the market? The Sponge?
No, no. No way.

52
00:02:34,377 --> 00:02:37,608
- Everybody loves the Sponge.
- I read it in Wa// Street Week.

53
00:02:37,777 --> 00:02:39,369
Louis Rukeyser.

54
00:02:42,497 --> 00:02:45,773
Hello, Lena?
Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld.

55
00:02:45,937 --> 00:02:47,609
How did I get your number?

56
00:02:47,777 --> 00:02:50,530
I met a guy that knows you,
he gave it to me.

57
00:02:50,897 --> 00:02:54,094
I don't remember his name.
I think it began with a W, maybe a Q.

58
00:02:54,737 --> 00:02:57,171
I wasn't paying attention.
I'd just come from shopping...

59
00:02:57,337 --> 00:02:58,770
...for a speedboat.

60
00:03:00,377 --> 00:03:03,050
You know, I really like those
new jeans Jerry was wearing.

61
00:03:03,217 --> 00:03:05,128
He's really thin.

62
00:03:06,657 --> 00:03:08,773
Not as thin as you think.

63
00:03:09,097 --> 00:03:12,806
Why? He's a 31.
I saw the tag on the back.

64
00:03:13,097 --> 00:03:14,974
The tag, huh?

65
00:03:15,977 --> 00:03:18,411
Let me tell you something
about that tag.

66
00:03:18,737 --> 00:03:23,049
It's no 31,
and let's just leave it at that.

67
00:03:23,857 --> 00:03:26,246
What are you talking about?

68
00:03:26,737 --> 00:03:30,332
He scratches off a 32
and he puts in "31."

69
00:03:30,497 --> 00:03:33,569
What? Oh, how could
he be so vain?

70
00:03:33,737 --> 00:03:36,729
Well, this is the Jerry Seinfeld
that only I know.

71
00:03:38,097 --> 00:03:40,850
- I can't believe I just told you that.
- Why not?

72
00:03:41,017 --> 00:03:43,087
Well, Jerry doesn't want
anyone to know.

73
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:45,487
It's all right, I'm your fiancée.
Everyone assumes...

74
00:03:45,657 --> 00:03:47,375
...you'll tell me everything.

75
00:03:48,377 --> 00:03:51,767
- Where did you get that from?
- Well, we're a couple. It's understood.

76
00:03:52,737 --> 00:03:55,205
- I never heard of that.
- Well, you've never been a couple.

77
00:03:55,377 --> 00:03:56,856
I've coupled. I've coupled.

78
00:03:57,497 --> 00:03:59,453
Keeping secrets.

79
00:03:59,617 --> 00:04:02,415
This is just like
your secret bank code.

80
00:04:02,577 --> 00:04:06,092
This is totally different. That was
my secret. This is Jerry's secret.

81
00:04:06,257 --> 00:04:08,487
There's attorney- client
privileges here.

82
00:04:08,657 --> 00:04:11,569
If I play it by your rule,
no one will ever confide in me again.

83
00:04:11,737 --> 00:04:13,773
I'll be cut out of the loop.

84
00:04:15,897 --> 00:04:17,774
- Hey.
- Hey.

85
00:04:18,017 --> 00:04:20,485
- What's the matter?
- I had a fight with Susan.

86
00:04:20,657 --> 00:04:21,931
What about?

87
00:04:23,657 --> 00:04:25,613
Clothing something, I don't know...

88
00:04:26,097 --> 00:04:29,373
- So, what are you doing tonight?
- I got a date with that girl Lena.

89
00:04:29,777 --> 00:04:33,213
- Lena? How did you meet her?
- I actually met her a few weeks ago...

90
00:04:33,377 --> 00:04:35,129
...but...

91
00:04:37,497 --> 00:04:42,571
Jerry got Lena's unlisted number
from Kramer's AIDS Walk list.

92
00:04:42,737 --> 00:04:46,730
Monica, Jerry got Lena's unlisted
number off of an AIDS Walk list.

93
00:04:46,897 --> 00:04:49,457
He got her number
off an AIDS Walk list?

94
00:04:52,577 --> 00:04:54,408
You met her
a few weeks ago, but?

95
00:04:54,577 --> 00:04:57,216
I didn't call her till today.

96
00:05:00,537 --> 00:05:02,732
So, wanna double?

97
00:05:02,897 --> 00:05:05,206
- What?
- Well, you know, I just had a fight.

98
00:05:05,377 --> 00:05:06,810
I need a group dynamic.

99
00:05:07,337 --> 00:05:09,055
- I don't know.
- Hey.

100
00:05:09,217 --> 00:05:11,447
- Hey.
- Well, Kramer was right.

101
00:05:11,617 --> 00:05:13,926
My friend Kim told me
the Sponge is off the market.

102
00:05:14,097 --> 00:05:15,769
- What are you gonna do?
- I'll tell you.

103
00:05:15,937 --> 00:05:19,009
I'm gonna do a hard target search
of every drug store, general store...

104
00:05:19,177 --> 00:05:22,647
...health store, grocery store
in a 25 block radius:

105
00:05:23,697 --> 00:05:24,891
Just for these Sponges?

106
00:05:25,137 --> 00:05:27,731
Hey, women are really loyal
to their birth-control methods.

107
00:05:27,897 --> 00:05:31,207
- What does Susan use?
- I don't know.

108
00:05:32,977 --> 00:05:35,366
- You don't now?
- I...

109
00:05:36,017 --> 00:05:37,894
Figure it's something.

110
00:05:42,897 --> 00:05:46,412
- What are you all out of breath from?
- The elevator just broke.

111
00:05:46,657 --> 00:05:49,091
I had to walk up five flights.

112
00:05:49,257 --> 00:05:52,408
And you got the AIDS Walk
tomorrow.

113
00:05:52,577 --> 00:05:54,807
You're never gonna make it.
You're in horrible shape.

114
00:05:54,977 --> 00:05:58,014
- I'm in tiptop shape.
- Tiptop?

115
00:05:58,177 --> 00:06:01,613
- Better than you.
- I got a 31 waist, mister.

116
00:06:02,457 --> 00:06:04,573
Well, I'm walking for charity.
What are you doing?

117
00:06:04,737 --> 00:06:09,049
What am I doing? I'm dating a woman
who happens to be sponsoring...

118
00:06:09,217 --> 00:06:11,447
...one of these walkers.

119
00:06:13,897 --> 00:06:16,365
Do you have any Today Sponges?

120
00:06:22,297 --> 00:06:24,970
Do you carry Today Sponges?

121
00:06:27,897 --> 00:06:31,048
- Can I help you?
- Do you have any Today Sponges?

122
00:06:31,217 --> 00:06:34,653
- I know they're off the market...
- Actually, we have a case left.

123
00:06:34,817 --> 00:06:37,854
A case? A case of Sponges?

124
00:06:38,377 --> 00:06:42,336
I mean, a case.

125
00:06:46,857 --> 00:06:49,212
How many come in a case?

126
00:06:49,377 --> 00:06:50,856
Sixty.

127
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:52,974
Sixty?

128
00:06:55,097 --> 00:06:57,008
- Well, I'll take three.
- Three?

129
00:06:57,177 --> 00:06:59,372
Yeah. Make it 10.

130
00:06:59,737 --> 00:07:02,854
- Ten?
- Twenty Sponges should be plenty.

131
00:07:03,977 --> 00:07:06,889
- Did you say 20?
- Yeah, 25 Sponges is just fine.

132
00:07:07,057 --> 00:07:08,809
- Twenty-five?
- Yeah.

133
00:07:08,977 --> 00:07:11,013
- You're set with 25?
- Yeah. Yeah.

134
00:07:11,177 --> 00:07:13,771
Just give me the whole case,
I'll be on my way.

135
00:07:17,457 --> 00:07:21,211
Hey, I have found the best-smelling
detergent. Lena, smell my shirt.

136
00:07:22,497 --> 00:07:24,806
- Very nice.
- It's All TempaCheer.

137
00:07:26,777 --> 00:07:28,813
I use Planet. It's biodegradable...

138
00:07:28,977 --> 00:07:30,569
...and it doesn't pollute the oceans.

139
00:07:30,737 --> 00:07:33,456
Yeah, the oceans are really
getting very sudsy.

140
00:07:34,577 --> 00:07:38,092
Can you wrap up all the leftovers
on the table, please?

141
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:40,089
I always take the leftovers.

142
00:07:40,257 --> 00:07:43,329
I work in a soup kitchen
every morning at 6 a.m.

143
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:45,852
They serve soup at 6 a. M?

144
00:07:46,017 --> 00:07:48,008
Yeah, that's all they have.

145
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:51,169
Do the bums ever complain,
"Soup again?"

146
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:53,134
- I'd get tired of it.
- How could you not?

147
00:07:53,297 --> 00:07:56,972
- Guess who volunteered last week.
- Mick Jagger.

148
00:07:57,897 --> 00:07:59,296
No.

149
00:07:59,537 --> 00:08:01,926
- Maya Angelou.
- Oh, the poet.

150
00:08:02,257 --> 00:08:06,375
So let me ask you something. These
people eat soup three times a day?

151
00:08:06,537 --> 00:08:08,414
- I don't know.
- Did you get to talk to her?

152
00:08:08,577 --> 00:08:10,727
- Talk to who?
- Is it a lot of cream soups?

153
00:08:10,897 --> 00:08:13,855
- Maya Angelou, the poet.
- No, I didn't get the chance.

154
00:08:14,017 --> 00:08:17,089
You know, I'm sure you can reach her.
She's a poet, you know.

155
00:08:17,257 --> 00:08:19,293
What does a poet need
an unlisted number for?

156
00:08:20,217 --> 00:08:23,527
- I'm going to the ladies' room.
- I'll go with you.

157
00:08:25,377 --> 00:08:26,890
Why are you
looking at me like that?

158
00:08:27,057 --> 00:08:29,173
Why did you have to mention
"unlisted number"?

159
00:08:29,337 --> 00:08:31,851
- What are you talking about?
- I gotta tell you something...

160
00:08:32,017 --> 00:08:33,575
...but you cannot tell Susan.

161
00:08:36,737 --> 00:08:40,491
Jerry got her phone number
off of an AIDS Walk list?

162
00:08:40,657 --> 00:08:42,852
- Oh, that's awful.
- I know, but don't say anything.

163
00:08:43,017 --> 00:08:44,575
He told me not to tell you.

164
00:08:44,737 --> 00:08:46,216
But you told me anyway?

165
00:08:46,697 --> 00:08:49,575
Well, you know, I was thinking
about what you said before...

166
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:53,616
...and you're right, I've never really
been a couple, so if that's the rule...

167
00:08:53,777 --> 00:08:56,245
...l'm gonna go by the rule.
- Thank you, honey.

168
00:08:56,977 --> 00:09:01,528
So you wanna go home
and make up officially?

169
00:09:01,897 --> 00:09:04,491
- Can we stop by a drug store first?
- What for?

170
00:09:04,737 --> 00:09:06,090
I'm out of birth control stuff.

171
00:09:06,257 --> 00:09:08,213
Oh, yeah.

172
00:09:08,377 --> 00:09:11,210
- Where am I gonna park?
- No, don't park. I'll just sit in the car.

173
00:09:11,377 --> 00:09:15,006
- You can run in.
- Me run in? Why don't you run in?

174
00:09:15,177 --> 00:09:17,452
You don't know what I use
for birth control, do you?

175
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:20,974
- Of course I do.
- You do? What?

176
00:09:21,297 --> 00:09:25,131
- You know, you use the:
- The what?

177
00:09:25,297 --> 00:09:27,686
You know, the:

178
00:09:27,857 --> 00:09:29,529
Just get me some Sponges, please.

179
00:09:29,697 --> 00:09:32,416
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
They don't have them anymore.

180
00:09:32,577 --> 00:09:34,693
- What?
- I just found out they're off the market.

181
00:09:34,857 --> 00:09:37,690
- Off the market? The Sponge?
- So you gotta use something else.

182
00:09:37,857 --> 00:09:41,736
I can't. I love the Sponge.
I need the Sponge.

183
00:09:43,097 --> 00:09:44,689
Okay.

184
00:09:45,657 --> 00:09:47,852
I think I know where we can get one.

185
00:09:56,537 --> 00:09:58,607
Kramer, what the hell
is going on in here?

186
00:09:58,777 --> 00:10:02,406
It's a poker game.
And I'm kicking some serious butt!

187
00:10:02,577 --> 00:10:05,011
Are you out of your mind?
You got the AIDS Walk tomorrow.

188
00:10:05,177 --> 00:10:08,487
- Hey, Kramer, are you in?
- Oh, you gotta be kidding...

189
00:10:08,657 --> 00:10:12,286
You see those two ladies
I got showing? Do they look scared?

190
00:10:12,457 --> 00:10:14,812
- What were you saying?
- You're never gonna make it.

191
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,485
Let's go! Let's go!
Rack them up! Come on!

192
00:10:25,617 --> 00:10:27,335
Do you?

193
00:10:27,857 --> 00:10:30,166
Do you wanna go in the bedroom?

194
00:10:32,737 --> 00:10:33,965
Okay.

195
00:10:34,137 --> 00:10:36,128
- Hold on just a second.
- Okay.

196
00:10:39,337 --> 00:10:41,089
Elaine, it's me, George.

197
00:10:44,937 --> 00:10:46,893
- Hey, sorry to bother you so late.
- Yeah.

198
00:10:47,057 --> 00:10:48,809
Hey, how you doing?

199
00:10:49,217 --> 00:10:52,095
- Did you get any of those Sponges?
- Yeah.

200
00:10:52,417 --> 00:10:54,885
Cleaned out the whole West Side.

201
00:10:57,137 --> 00:10:58,570
Why?

202
00:10:59,177 --> 00:11:02,408
- Well, Susan.
- Oh, Susan uses the Sponge.

203
00:11:02,577 --> 00:11:05,455
- Susan loves the Sponge.
- Yeah, I'm sorry, George.

204
00:11:05,617 --> 00:11:07,847
- I can't help you out.
- What?

205
00:11:08,017 --> 00:11:10,167
I can't do it. No way.
There's no how.

206
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,487
Wait... Elaine.
Let me explain something to you.

207
00:11:12,657 --> 00:11:15,046
You see, this is not just
a weekend routine.

208
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:17,048
I'm on the verge
of make- up sex here.

209
00:11:17,217 --> 00:11:18,855
- You know about make- up sex?
- Oh, yeah.

210
00:11:19,017 --> 00:11:22,214
George, I know all about
make- up sex and I'm really sorry.

211
00:11:22,377 --> 00:11:23,605
But, Elaine...

212
00:11:23,777 --> 00:11:26,575
Elaine, can I just explain
something to you very privately.

213
00:11:26,737 --> 00:11:30,013
Susan and I have been together
many, many times now...

214
00:11:30,177 --> 00:11:33,249
...and just between you and me,
there's really no big surprises here...

215
00:11:33,417 --> 00:11:36,215
...so make- up sex
is all that I have left.

216
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:41,376
I'm sure you'll have
another fight, George.

217
00:11:44,817 --> 00:11:46,250
Hold that thought.

218
00:12:00,537 --> 00:12:02,050
Oh, so listen to this.

219
00:12:02,377 --> 00:12:04,129
But don't tell anyone.

220
00:12:04,297 --> 00:12:07,175
Jerry Seinfeld,
he got a woman's number...

221
00:12:07,337 --> 00:12:09,453
...off an AIDS Walk list.

222
00:12:09,617 --> 00:12:12,415
He got her number
off an AIDS Walk list?

223
00:12:12,577 --> 00:12:14,568
He what?

224
00:12:18,297 --> 00:12:19,855
How did you find out?

225
00:12:20,177 --> 00:12:22,691
A friend of a friend
of a friend knows Susan.

226
00:12:22,857 --> 00:12:25,087
- George!
- Pardon?

227
00:12:25,657 --> 00:12:28,808
- Pardon?
- Nothing. Listen, I'm sorry. I just...

228
00:12:28,977 --> 00:12:32,572
It's okay. There's nothing
to be sorry about. I don't mind.

229
00:12:33,137 --> 00:12:35,697
You don't mind that I got your number
off the AIDS Walk list?

230
00:12:35,857 --> 00:12:38,769
No, not at all. No problem.

231
00:12:45,137 --> 00:12:47,014
Call me later, okay?

232
00:12:49,497 --> 00:12:53,536
You're lucky you're walking out of here
with a pair of pants on!

233
00:12:54,617 --> 00:12:56,573
Kramer, you went all night?

234
00:12:56,737 --> 00:13:00,491
- Jerry, breakfast on me.
- Kramer, are you out of your mind?

235
00:13:00,657 --> 00:13:02,295
You got the AIDS Walk
in three hours.

236
00:13:02,457 --> 00:13:05,096
- You're never gonna make it.
- AIDS Walk, that's a cake walk.

237
00:13:05,257 --> 00:13:06,656
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

238
00:13:09,537 --> 00:13:11,767
- So, George...?
- Yeah.

239
00:13:12,497 --> 00:13:15,807
Guess what? Lena found out
how I got her number.

240
00:13:17,137 --> 00:13:21,255
- Really? How did she do that?
- A friend of a friend of Susan's.

241
00:13:21,617 --> 00:13:24,085
- My Susan?
- Why did you tell her?

242
00:13:24,497 --> 00:13:27,694
I had to, Jerry. It's a couple rule.
We have to tell each other everything.

243
00:13:27,857 --> 00:13:29,768
- You know what this means?
- What?

244
00:13:29,937 --> 00:13:32,326
You're cut off!
You're out of the loop!

245
00:13:33,417 --> 00:13:35,851
You're cutting me off?
No, no, Jerry, don't cut me off.

246
00:13:36,017 --> 00:13:38,008
You leave me no choice.
You're the media now...

247
00:13:38,177 --> 00:13:40,213
...as far as I'm concerned.
- Oh, Jerry, come on.

248
00:13:40,377 --> 00:13:41,730
Please, it won't happen again.

249
00:13:41,897 --> 00:13:44,969
If you were in the Mafia, would you tell
her every time you killed someone?

250
00:13:45,137 --> 00:13:48,254
Hey, a hit is a totally different story.

251
00:13:48,417 --> 00:13:52,456
- I don't know, George.
- So Lena was upset, huh?

252
00:13:52,617 --> 00:13:54,847
You know what,
that was the amazing thing.

253
00:13:55,017 --> 00:13:57,690
- What? It didn't bother her?
- No, she said it was fine.

254
00:13:57,857 --> 00:13:59,688
Something very strange
about this girl.

255
00:13:59,857 --> 00:14:01,176
What?

256
00:14:01,937 --> 00:14:03,609
- She's too good.
- Too good?

257
00:14:03,777 --> 00:14:06,575
I mean, she's giving and caring
and generally concerned...

258
00:14:06,737 --> 00:14:10,366
...about the welfare of others.
I can't be with someone like that.

259
00:14:10,657 --> 00:14:12,932
- I see what you mean.
- I admire the hell out of her.

260
00:14:13,097 --> 00:14:15,372
You can't have sex
with someone you admire.

261
00:14:15,737 --> 00:14:17,967
- Where is the depravity?
- No depravity.

262
00:14:18,137 --> 00:14:21,209
I mean, I look at her.
I can't imagine she even has sex.

263
00:14:21,617 --> 00:14:23,812
On the other hand...

264
00:14:26,737 --> 00:14:29,934
- What?
- Thanks again for last night.

265
00:14:30,097 --> 00:14:32,486
- Hey, I didn't even use one.
- Yeah.

266
00:14:32,657 --> 00:14:34,568
- I thought you said it was imminent.
- It was.

267
00:14:34,737 --> 00:14:38,935
But then I just couldn't decide
if he was really spongeworthy.

268
00:14:40,217 --> 00:14:41,411
Spongeworthy?

269
00:14:41,577 --> 00:14:43,693
Yeah, Jerry, I have to conserve...

270
00:14:43,857 --> 00:14:45,609
...these Sponges.
- But you like this guy.

271
00:14:45,777 --> 00:14:47,608
- Isn't that what the Sponges are for?
- Yes.

272
00:14:47,777 --> 00:14:50,814
Before they went off the market.
But now I've got to re- evaluate...

273
00:14:50,977 --> 00:14:52,410
...my whole screening process.

274
00:14:52,577 --> 00:14:54,886
I can't afford to waste any of them.

275
00:14:56,017 --> 00:14:58,690
You know, you're nuts
with these Sponges.

276
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:01,325
George is getting frustrated.

277
00:15:06,937 --> 00:15:08,814
Cosmo Kramer.

278
00:15:08,977 --> 00:15:10,695
- Okay. You're checked in.
- Thank you.

279
00:15:10,857 --> 00:15:12,449
- Here's your AIDS ribbon.
- No, thanks.

280
00:15:12,937 --> 00:15:14,734
- You don't wanna wear one?
- No, no.

281
00:15:14,897 --> 00:15:17,127
- But you have to wear an AIDS ribbon.
- I have to?

282
00:15:17,497 --> 00:15:19,613
- Yes.
- See, that's why I don't want to.

283
00:15:19,777 --> 00:15:23,167
But everyone wears the ribbon.
You must wear the ribbon.

284
00:15:24,417 --> 00:15:26,726
You know what you are?
You're a ribbon bully.

285
00:15:26,897 --> 00:15:30,651
Hey! Hey, you, come back here!
Come back here and put this on!

286
00:15:33,497 --> 00:15:36,773
Elaine and her Sponges. She's got
like a war chest full of them.

287
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:38,848
I don't see
why you can't just use condoms.

288
00:15:39,257 --> 00:15:42,169
Oh, no, no.
No, condoms are for single men.

289
00:15:42,337 --> 00:15:45,727
The day that we got engaged, I said
goodbye to the condom forever.

290
00:15:46,417 --> 00:15:48,453
Just once, for the make- up sex.

291
00:15:48,617 --> 00:15:50,414
Make- up sex?
You have to have that...

292
00:15:50,577 --> 00:15:52,488
...right after the fight.
We're way past that.

293
00:15:52,657 --> 00:15:54,852
- Come on, just once.
- No, no, I hate the condom.

294
00:15:55,017 --> 00:15:56,655
Why?

295
00:15:56,817 --> 00:15:59,490
I can never get the package
open in time.

296
00:15:59,697 --> 00:16:03,053
- Well, you just tear it open.
- It's not that easy.

297
00:16:03,217 --> 00:16:05,777
It's like Beat the C/ock.
There's a lot of pressure there.

298
00:16:09,617 --> 00:16:11,972
- Hey, where's your ribbon?
- Oh, I don't wear the ribbon.

299
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,651
You don't wear the ribbon?
Aren't you against AIDS?

300
00:16:14,817 --> 00:16:17,889
Yeah, I'm against AIDS.
I mean, I'm walking, aren't I?

301
00:16:18,057 --> 00:16:20,491
- I just don't wear the ribbon.
- Who do you think you are?

302
00:16:20,657 --> 00:16:23,330
- Put the ribbon on.
- Hey, Cedric, Bob.

303
00:16:23,497 --> 00:16:24,976
This guy won't wear a ribbon.

304
00:16:26,217 --> 00:16:29,129
Who? Who doesn't
want to wear the ribbon?

305
00:16:32,937 --> 00:16:35,735
- So you think you're spongeworthy?
- Yes, I think I'm spongeworthy.

306
00:16:35,897 --> 00:16:38,252
I think I'm very spongeworthy.

307
00:16:38,737 --> 00:16:41,695
Run down your case for me again.

308
00:16:41,857 --> 00:16:45,691
Well, we've gone out several times.
We obviously have a good rapport.

309
00:16:45,857 --> 00:16:48,815
I own a very profitable
electronics distributing firm.

310
00:16:48,977 --> 00:16:51,935
I eat well. I exercise.
Blood tests, immaculate.

311
00:16:52,657 --> 00:16:56,969
And if I can speak frankly,
I'm actually quite good at it.

312
00:16:59,057 --> 00:17:00,456
You gonna do something...

313
00:17:00,617 --> 00:17:02,926
...about your sideburns?
- Yeah, I told you.

314
00:17:03,417 --> 00:17:05,248
I'm gonna trim my sideburns.

315
00:17:05,537 --> 00:17:08,654
- And the bathroom in your apartment?
- Cleaned it this morning.

316
00:17:08,817 --> 00:17:12,492
- The sink, the tub, everything clean?
- Everything. It's spotless.

317
00:17:14,537 --> 00:17:16,767
- All right, let's go.
- Okay.

318
00:17:22,577 --> 00:17:23,771
- Hi.
- Hi.

319
00:17:24,337 --> 00:17:27,932
Hey, look at this. I just got a citation
in the mail for my work with shut-ins.

320
00:17:28,097 --> 00:17:29,894
Oh, the shut-ins, that's nice.

321
00:17:30,057 --> 00:17:32,287
You know, they're
a very eccentric group...

322
00:17:32,457 --> 00:17:36,291
...because they're shut in.
Of course, they're not locked in...

323
00:17:36,457 --> 00:17:38,254
...they're free to go at any time.

324
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:42,536
Oh, by the way, I checked at the soup
kitchen, they do have cream soups.

325
00:17:42,697 --> 00:17:44,574
Hey, that's dynamite.
You know, Lena...

326
00:17:44,737 --> 00:17:48,173
...I wanted to talk to you
about something.

327
00:17:48,577 --> 00:17:51,137
You know, because
you're such a good person...

328
00:17:51,297 --> 00:17:53,049
...that l...
- Oh, hang on to that thought.

329
00:17:53,217 --> 00:17:55,856
I'm rinsing a sweater.
I left the water running.

330
00:17:56,017 --> 00:17:58,577
Hey, Jerry, can you get me a towel
out of my bedroom closet?

331
00:17:58,737 --> 00:18:00,375
Oh, okay.

332
00:18:06,017 --> 00:18:08,531
Oh, my God.
Look what's going on here.

333
00:18:10,057 --> 00:18:12,366
She is depraved.

334
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,565
- There you are.
- Thanks.

335
00:18:21,217 --> 00:18:24,175
- So you were saying?
- What? Nothing.

336
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:26,646
No, you said I was a good person...

337
00:18:28,217 --> 00:18:29,969
You seem like
you wanna tell me something.

338
00:18:30,177 --> 00:18:32,896
Tell you something? I do.

339
00:18:33,057 --> 00:18:35,525
What is it, Jerry?
You can tell me anything.

340
00:18:36,977 --> 00:18:40,014
- You see these jeans I'm wearing?
- Yeah?

341
00:18:40,177 --> 00:18:42,850
I change the 32 waist on the label...

342
00:18:43,017 --> 00:18:46,612
...to a 31 on all my jeans.

343
00:18:47,217 --> 00:18:49,253
So you know...

344
00:18:49,457 --> 00:18:51,527
That's it.

345
00:18:54,897 --> 00:18:57,570
- Come on, George, just rip it open.
- I'm trying, damn it.

346
00:18:57,737 --> 00:19:00,171
- Tear it from the side.
- I tried to tear it from the side.

347
00:19:00,337 --> 00:19:02,897
I can't get a good grip.
You gotta do it like a bag of chips.

348
00:19:03,057 --> 00:19:04,331
- Give it to me.
- Wait a second.

349
00:19:04,497 --> 00:19:06,453
- Give it to me. Give it to me.
- Wait a second.

350
00:19:06,617 --> 00:19:08,494
You see? You see?

351
00:19:08,657 --> 00:19:10,454
I got it.

352
00:19:10,897 --> 00:19:12,489
Come on.

353
00:19:12,897 --> 00:19:14,376
Come on.

354
00:19:15,817 --> 00:19:17,728
It's too late.

355
00:19:18,377 --> 00:19:20,686
So, what's it going to be?

356
00:19:20,857 --> 00:19:22,688
Are you going to wear the ribbon?

357
00:19:23,057 --> 00:19:24,968
No. Never.

358
00:19:25,137 --> 00:19:27,526
But I'm wearing the ribbon.
He's wearing the ribbon.

359
00:19:27,697 --> 00:19:29,289
We are all wearing the ribbon.

360
00:19:29,457 --> 00:19:31,368
So why aren't you
going to wear the ribbon?

361
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:34,210
This is America. I don't have to wear
anything I don't want to!

362
00:19:34,377 --> 00:19:37,733
- What are we gonna do with him?
- I guess we're just going to...

363
00:19:37,897 --> 00:19:40,457
...have to teach him
to wear the ribbon.

364
00:19:48,817 --> 00:19:51,490
- It completely turned her off.
- Well, I can see that.

365
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:54,694
Why do you have to do that for?
Who cares about your pant size?

366
00:19:54,857 --> 00:19:56,927
I don't wanna be a 32.

367
00:19:57,657 --> 00:19:59,488
I'd kill to be a 32.

368
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:03,491
She said I wasn't spongeworthy.
Wouldn't waste a Sponge on me.

369
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:06,849
I wish I had one.
That condom killed me.

370
00:20:07,017 --> 00:20:09,929
Why do they have to make
the wrappers so hard to open?

371
00:20:10,097 --> 00:20:14,090
It's probably so the woman has
one last chance to change her mind.

372
00:20:14,417 --> 00:20:17,887
You never run out, do you?
Where's Kramer?

373
00:20:18,057 --> 00:20:20,776
- Everything's finished here.
- I told him he'd never make it.

374
00:20:20,937 --> 00:20:23,053
He was up all night.

375
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:27,208
Oh, my God. Kramer?

376
00:20:46,777 --> 00:20:49,166
Look at you. I told you.

377
00:20:49,337 --> 00:20:52,056
Up all night playing poker.

378
00:20:52,457 --> 00:20:54,049
Come on.

379
00:20:56,737 --> 00:20:58,967
Hey, where's your AIDS ribbon?

380
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:12,973
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

381
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:15,210
How did you sleep?

382
00:21:16,137 --> 00:21:17,775
Great.

383
00:21:17,937 --> 00:21:20,167
- You?
- Fine, fine.

384
00:21:20,337 --> 00:21:23,056
Everything okay?

385
00:21:23,497 --> 00:21:25,931
- Yep.
- No regrets?

386
00:21:26,417 --> 00:21:28,009
Nope.

387
00:21:30,257 --> 00:21:33,533
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean?

388
00:21:33,697 --> 00:21:36,211
Oh, I don't think so.

389
00:21:36,817 --> 00:21:39,331
Why not? I thought you said
everything was fine.

390
00:21:39,497 --> 00:21:42,728
I wish I could help you,
but I can't afford two of them.
