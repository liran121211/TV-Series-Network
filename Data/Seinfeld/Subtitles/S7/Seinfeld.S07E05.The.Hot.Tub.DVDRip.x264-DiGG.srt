1
00:00:04,477 --> 00:00:06,832
I feel bad for the silver-medal winner
in the Olympics.</i>

2
00:00:06,997 --> 00:00:08,874
I mean, how do you live with that?</i>

3
00:00:09,037 --> 00:00:12,393
"How much did you lose by?"
I don't even know.</i>

4
00:00:12,557 --> 00:00:16,755
It was like from now to now.
Now to now. Now, now, now."</i>

5
00:00:17,597 --> 00:00:19,474
It was... and that was it, I lost.

6
00:00:19,637 --> 00:00:21,548
I trained, I worked out, I exercised.</i>

7
00:00:21,717 --> 00:00:23,036
I was doing pushups, sit-ups.

8
00:00:23,197 --> 00:00:25,188
I never did anything but exercise
for 20 years.</i>

9
00:00:25,357 --> 00:00:27,268
I flew halfway around the world...</i>

10
00:00:29,797 --> 00:00:33,267
And that was that.
It was a photo finish.

11
00:00:33,637 --> 00:00:35,514
Silver, gold.</i>

12
00:00:36,357 --> 00:00:39,076
"If I had a pimple, I would have won."</i>

13
00:00:43,357 --> 00:00:45,587
Can't believe you write
for the J. Peterman catalogue.</i>

14
00:00:45,757 --> 00:00:49,352
Get this one,
"I packed my rod and reel.</i>

15
00:00:49,517 --> 00:00:51,951
Thirty hours later, lost in the fjord...</i>

16
00:00:52,117 --> 00:00:53,596
...a welcoming smile.</i>

17
00:00:53,757 --> 00:00:58,069
Thank God she spotted the epaulets
on my Norwegian ice-fishing vest."</i>

18
00:00:59,037 --> 00:01:01,597
This catalogue is all about
how to score in a foreign country.</i>

19
00:01:01,757 --> 00:01:03,987
- Yeah, what do you do all day?
- Not that much.</i>

20
00:01:04,437 --> 00:01:06,871
I thought that new promotion
was supposed to be more work?</i>

21
00:01:07,037 --> 00:01:08,186
When the season starts.</i>

22
00:01:08,357 --> 00:01:10,234
Right now, I sit around
pretending I'm busy.</i>

23
00:01:10,397 --> 00:01:13,628
- How do you pull that off?
- I always look annoyed.</i>

24
00:01:14,677 --> 00:01:18,511
When you look annoyed all the time,
people think that you're busy.</i>

25
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,629
Think about it.

26
00:01:24,597 --> 00:01:25,586
Yeah, you do.</i>

27
00:01:25,757 --> 00:01:27,190
- He looks busy.
- He looks very busy.</i>

28
00:01:27,357 --> 00:01:28,710
I know what I'm doing.

29
00:01:28,877 --> 00:01:31,596
In fact, Mr. Wilhelm gave me
one of those little stress dolls.</i>

30
00:01:31,757 --> 00:01:34,874
All right. Back to work.

31
00:01:38,157 --> 00:01:39,909
So did you come up
with a stupid story...</i>

32
00:01:40,077 --> 00:01:41,829
...for the Himalayan
walking shoe yet?</i>

33
00:01:41,997 --> 00:01:44,147
No, I'm completely blocked.</i>

34
00:01:44,317 --> 00:01:46,831
In fact, I'm gonna work on it tonight.

35
00:01:47,077 --> 00:01:48,476
Oh, no.

36
00:01:48,637 --> 00:01:52,630
I can't. I got that marathon runner
coming in tonight.</i>

37
00:01:52,797 --> 00:01:54,025
What marathon runner?</i>

38
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,994
You know, this guy, Jean-Paul...?</i>

39
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:58,034
I met him when I was
working at Pendant...</i>

40
00:01:58,197 --> 00:01:59,516
...editing a book on running.</i>

41
00:01:59,837 --> 00:02:02,397
- Oh, wait Jean-Paul Jean-Paul.
- Yes.</i>

42
00:02:02,557 --> 00:02:04,627
He overslept at the Olympics
four years ago...</i>

43
00:02:04,797 --> 00:02:06,992
...missed the marathon.</i>

44
00:02:07,717 --> 00:02:08,911
Yeah, that's him.</i>

45
00:02:09,077 --> 00:02:11,033
He's from Trinidad and Tobago,
right?</i>

46
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:14,314
Yeah, he's
Trinidadian and Tobagan.</i>

47
00:02:16,357 --> 00:02:18,188
How do you oversleep
at the Olympics?</i>

48
00:02:18,397 --> 00:02:19,989
I know. I know.

49
00:02:20,157 --> 00:02:21,909
It's like the biggest event
of your life.</i>

50
00:02:22,077 --> 00:02:23,874
You'd think you'd have
six alarm clocks...</i>

51
00:02:24,037 --> 00:02:26,505
...paying off little kids
to come banging on your door.</i>

52
00:02:26,677 --> 00:02:28,156
Well, he was pretty devastated.</i>

53
00:02:28,317 --> 00:02:30,547
This is his first race in three years.</i>

54
00:02:31,037 --> 00:02:32,948
That's a big responsibility
on your hands.</i>

55
00:02:33,277 --> 00:02:35,507
What responsibility?
I don't have any responsibility.</i>

56
00:02:35,677 --> 00:02:38,032
Well, you gotta wake him up.</i>

57
00:02:39,357 --> 00:02:41,029
He'll get up.</i>

58
00:02:41,437 --> 00:02:43,029
- Hi, Judy.
- Hi, Elaine, how are you?</i>

59
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:44,471
Fine.</i>

60
00:02:44,637 --> 00:02:46,229
- I've seen her in your building.
- Yeah.</i>

61
00:02:46,397 --> 00:02:48,547
- I didn't know she was married.
- She's not.</i>

62
00:02:49,757 --> 00:02:52,908
And the guy just took off.</i>

63
00:02:54,357 --> 00:02:56,552
- Don't say anything.
- Who am I gonna tell?</i>

64
00:02:56,717 --> 00:02:59,151
I know, it's just something
you have to say.</i>

65
00:03:09,917 --> 00:03:11,987
George, we just got
the final budget numbers.</i>

66
00:03:12,157 --> 00:03:13,909
We went over budget
on some of the items...</i>

67
00:03:14,077 --> 00:03:16,591
...but I don't think
there's gonna be a problem.</i>

68
00:03:16,757 --> 00:03:18,349
I'll let you get back to work,
George.</i>

69
00:03:28,437 --> 00:03:30,075
He overslept
and missed the whole race.</i>

70
00:03:30,237 --> 00:03:32,353
- Isn't that amazing?
- I'll tell you what happened.</i>

71
00:03:32,517 --> 00:03:35,031
I bet he got
the a. m.- p. m. mixed up.</i>

72
00:03:36,557 --> 00:03:38,070
My money's on the snooze.</i>

73
00:03:38,237 --> 00:03:41,388
I bet he hit the snooze for an extra five,
and it never came back on.</i>

74
00:03:43,197 --> 00:03:45,313
Imagine, your whole life riding
on an alarm clock.</i>

75
00:03:45,477 --> 00:03:48,435
Alarm clocks? No, I never use them.
Don't trust them.</i>

76
00:03:48,597 --> 00:03:51,236
- What do you do?
- I have a mental alarm.</i>

77
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,786
I set my head
for quarter to 7...</i>

78
00:03:53,957 --> 00:03:56,346
...and... I get up.</i>

79
00:03:56,517 --> 00:03:58,269
- It always works?
- It never fails.</i>

80
00:03:58,437 --> 00:04:00,029
See, it's based on your body clock.</i>

81
00:04:00,197 --> 00:04:03,553
Your body has an internal mechanism.
It knows what time it is.</i>

82
00:04:04,397 --> 00:04:08,470
- What's with the bucket?
- Lomez, he sold me his hot tub.</i>

83
00:04:08,637 --> 00:04:10,389
- Hot tub?
- Yeah, it's in my living room.</i>

84
00:04:10,557 --> 00:04:11,546
I just gotta fill it.

85
00:04:12,037 --> 00:04:14,676
You put a hot tub
in your living room?

86
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:17,635
It's a beauty. It's got these
high-volume accusage jets...</i>

87
00:04:17,797 --> 00:04:22,348
...oscillating and pulsating,
soothing your every aching muscle.</i>

88
00:04:22,517 --> 00:04:25,714
That water's gonna get
over 120 degrees.</i>

89
00:04:26,637 --> 00:04:29,947
- Is that tolerable?
- Oh, it's tolerable.</i>

90
00:04:30,917 --> 00:04:34,148
Isn't that the same temperature
of the coffee that scalded you?</i>

91
00:04:35,077 --> 00:04:38,069
I think it's a little cooler than that.</i>

92
00:04:39,557 --> 00:04:41,309
He doesn't have any running water?</i>

93
00:04:41,477 --> 00:04:43,388
I don't ask those kind
of questions anymore.</i>

94
00:04:45,797 --> 00:04:46,866
Jerry, this is Jean-Paul.</i>

95
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:49,392
- Hi, Jean-Paul, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.</i>

96
00:04:49,557 --> 00:04:52,993
- Sorry about the Olympics.
- Me too.</i>

97
00:04:53,637 --> 00:04:56,834
Listen, I'm gonna go call work,
see if I can get my deadline extended.</i>

98
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:59,227
I can't come up
with anything for this thing.</i>

99
00:04:59,397 --> 00:05:00,750
Catalogue-writer's block?</i>

100
00:05:01,437 --> 00:05:03,393
Yeah, that's funny.</i>

101
00:05:09,277 --> 00:05:10,949
So, what happened?</i>

102
00:05:12,157 --> 00:05:13,954
The snooze alarm, wasn't it?</i>

103
00:05:14,117 --> 00:05:15,709
No, man, it wasn't the snooze.</i>

104
00:05:15,877 --> 00:05:19,233
Most people think it was the snooze,
but no, no snooze.</i>

105
00:05:19,397 --> 00:05:23,390
- A.m. -p. m?
- Man, it wasn't the a. m.- p. m.</i>

106
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:24,910
It was the volume.</i>

107
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:28,348
- Oh, the volume.
- Yes, the volume.</i>

108
00:05:28,517 --> 00:05:31,031
There was a separate knob
for the radio alarm.</i>

109
00:05:31,437 --> 00:05:35,555
- Oh, separate knob.
- Yeah, separate knob.</i>

110
00:05:35,717 --> 00:05:39,551
Why separate knob!
Why separate knob!</i>

111
00:05:39,717 --> 00:05:42,914
Some people like to have the alarm
a little louder than the radio.</i>

112
00:05:43,077 --> 00:05:45,875
Oh, please, man, please!</i>

113
00:05:46,037 --> 00:05:49,666
It's not gonna happen again.
Not if I have anything to say about it.</i>

114
00:05:49,837 --> 00:05:52,431
Elaine, what's the alarm clock
situation at your house?</i>

115
00:05:52,597 --> 00:05:54,553
- Jerry...
- It's a simple question.</i>

116
00:05:54,717 --> 00:05:57,470
I've got an alarm, okay?</i>

117
00:05:57,637 --> 00:06:00,834
That old one? Didn't I miss a flight
to Cleveland because of that clock?</i>

118
00:06:00,997 --> 00:06:02,749
- Flight to Cleveland?
- It works.</i>

119
00:06:02,917 --> 00:06:05,989
- Elaine.
- It works.</i>

120
00:06:08,917 --> 00:06:12,671
"Singing duo, Captain and..."?</i>

121
00:06:16,077 --> 00:06:17,908
Tennille!</i>

122
00:06:21,277 --> 00:06:23,188
Come on.</i>

123
00:06:26,957 --> 00:06:28,356
George...</i>

124
00:06:28,517 --> 00:06:30,747
...I think you may be
taking work too seriously.</i>

125
00:06:30,917 --> 00:06:33,272
Well, I've got a lot to do.</i>

126
00:06:33,437 --> 00:06:35,393
George, I'll tell you
what I'd like you to do.</i>

127
00:06:35,557 --> 00:06:39,072
I'd like you to drop everything.
I have this fun little assignment.</i>

128
00:06:39,237 --> 00:06:41,307
There are some reps in
from the Houston Astros...</i>

129
00:06:41,477 --> 00:06:43,149
...for talks on
that Interleague Play...</i>

130
00:06:43,317 --> 00:06:45,467
...and I want you
to show them a good time.</i>

131
00:06:49,797 --> 00:06:52,265
Hey. Sorry I'm late.</i>

132
00:06:52,437 --> 00:06:53,950
You're 40 minutes late.</i>

133
00:06:54,117 --> 00:06:56,836
- What happened?
- I got held up.</i>

134
00:06:56,997 --> 00:06:59,716
- Do you mind if I heat this muffin up?
- No.</i>

135
00:06:59,957 --> 00:07:02,107
What? What is the problem?</i>

136
00:07:02,277 --> 00:07:04,313
You said you were gonna be here
a certain time...</i>

137
00:07:04,477 --> 00:07:06,229
...and you weren't.</i>

138
00:07:07,557 --> 00:07:09,149
And this all means what?</i>

139
00:07:09,317 --> 00:07:11,387
It means that a man
has come from very far away...</i>

140
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:13,309
...to compete in
a very difficult race...</i>

141
00:07:13,477 --> 00:07:15,786
...put his faith in you,
and I'm a little concerned.</i>

142
00:07:15,957 --> 00:07:17,754
- Oh, are you?
- Yes, I am.</i>

143
00:07:17,917 --> 00:07:20,590
Hey, I'm not running
in the marathon, he is.</i>

144
00:07:20,757 --> 00:07:21,826
- Yeah, I know that.
- Yeah.</i>

145
00:07:21,997 --> 00:07:24,511
I've got enough to think about
trying to come up with...</i>

146
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:26,588
...some crap for that
Himalayan walking shoe.</i>

147
00:07:26,757 --> 00:07:28,987
I've given him a place to stay,
I'll set an alarm...</i>

148
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,625
...but I'm not gonna turn my life
completely upside down.</i>

149
00:07:31,797 --> 00:07:35,710
I'm not talking about upside down,
I'm talking about waking him up.</i>

150
00:07:36,157 --> 00:07:37,829
Hey, Jean-Paul.</i>

151
00:07:38,757 --> 00:07:40,509
Jean-Paul, how was your soak?
A good soak?</i>

152
00:07:40,677 --> 00:07:44,511
Oh, man, very good soak.
The soak of the year.</i>

153
00:07:45,277 --> 00:07:47,074
What's burning?

154
00:07:48,037 --> 00:07:49,789
My muffin.

155
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:52,031
Shoot.

156
00:07:52,197 --> 00:07:53,755
- What happened?
- I don't know.</i>

157
00:07:53,917 --> 00:07:55,396
I set this thing for 20 seconds.</i>

158
00:07:55,557 --> 00:07:58,276
This was for two minutes, see?</i>

159
00:07:58,437 --> 00:07:59,711
Don't say anything.

160
00:07:59,877 --> 00:08:01,788
Don't say anything.

161
00:08:01,957 --> 00:08:04,027
You mis-set the timer?</i>

162
00:08:04,957 --> 00:08:08,029
Jean-Paul, it's not
my microwave, okay? Okay?</i>

163
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:10,427
All right, listen, let's just go.
Come on, Jean-Paul.</i>

164
00:08:10,597 --> 00:08:12,394
- Let's go.
- Okay.</i>

165
00:08:13,397 --> 00:08:15,627
- We'll see you at the race, okay?
- Yeah, I hope so.</i>

166
00:08:15,797 --> 00:08:17,355
Oh, that's cute.</i>

167
00:08:18,597 --> 00:08:21,236
Kramer, I'm telling you,
Elaine doesn't know what she's doing.</i>

168
00:08:21,397 --> 00:08:23,911
I gotta take over
this whole operation.</i>

169
00:08:25,237 --> 00:08:27,114
Jerry, look how tense you are.</i>

170
00:08:27,277 --> 00:08:29,347
You need to take a soak.</i>

171
00:08:29,757 --> 00:08:30,906
I'm not taking a soak...

172
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:34,228
...in that human bacteria frappe
you got going there.</i>

173
00:08:34,397 --> 00:08:37,230
I'm telling you, it's great.
I opened up all the windows.</i>

174
00:08:37,397 --> 00:08:40,309
The air is cold,
the tub is boiling hot.</i>

175
00:08:40,477 --> 00:08:42,195
It's like Sweden, man.</i>

176
00:08:42,357 --> 00:08:44,871
Sweden.</i>

177
00:08:56,717 --> 00:09:00,187
Oh, yeah.</i>

178
00:09:06,717 --> 00:09:08,150
Till this bastard over here says:</i>

179
00:09:08,317 --> 00:09:10,911
"Let's call the sons of bitches,
go visit them in New York."</i>

180
00:09:12,757 --> 00:09:14,873
Well, we're certainly glad
that you could make it.</i>

181
00:09:15,037 --> 00:09:16,993
I like your organization, George.</i>

182
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:20,593
We've been talking to a friendly
son of bitch in the front office.</i>

183
00:09:20,757 --> 00:09:24,113
- Wilhelm, I think his name is.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, Mr. Wilhelm.</i>

184
00:09:24,277 --> 00:09:28,668
He told us George Costanza's gonna
be taking us bastards out on the town.</i>

185
00:09:28,837 --> 00:09:32,750
We said, "That son of a bitch doesn't
know what he's got in store for him."</i>

186
00:09:32,917 --> 00:09:35,067
- Finish your drink?
- Oh, yeah, almost. Almost.</i>

187
00:09:35,237 --> 00:09:38,274
Let's get that bastard
to bring us another round, huh?</i>

188
00:09:39,317 --> 00:09:40,750
You a big drinker, George?</i>

189
00:09:41,317 --> 00:09:43,512
Well, maybe not
as much as this bastard.</i>

190
00:09:44,797 --> 00:09:46,196
I can hold my own.

191
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:15,513
Jean-Paul, I asked you down here
because I am concerned.</i>

192
00:10:15,677 --> 00:10:19,716
Concerned that tomorrow is perhaps
the biggest race of your entire career...</i>

193
00:10:19,877 --> 00:10:23,711
...and the person with whom
you have chosen to stay is...</i>

194
00:10:23,877 --> 00:10:27,665
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying, get the hell out of there!</i>

195
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:30,186
Let me put you in a hotel.
You'll be comfortable.</i>

196
00:10:30,357 --> 00:10:33,588
You'll be near the starting line,
and most importantly...</i>

197
00:10:33,757 --> 00:10:36,191
...you'll have a wake-up call,
Jean-Paul.</i>

198
00:10:36,357 --> 00:10:39,076
- A wake-up call.
- Wake-up call?</i>

199
00:10:39,237 --> 00:10:40,306
These people never fail.</i>

200
00:10:40,477 --> 00:10:43,435
They sit in a room
with a big clock all night long...</i>

201
00:10:43,597 --> 00:10:45,792
...just waiting to make that call.</i>

202
00:10:46,637 --> 00:10:49,310
No, I will stay with Elaine,
it would be rude.</i>

203
00:10:49,477 --> 00:10:51,388
Hey, you bastards.</i>

204
00:10:53,637 --> 00:10:54,786
Hey, so how was the meeting?</i>

205
00:10:54,957 --> 00:10:57,187
I really like those sons of bitches.</i>

206
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:59,268
- Sons of bitches?
- Yeah. That's how they talk.</i>

207
00:10:59,437 --> 00:11:01,712
You know, everyone's a bastard
or a son of a bitch.</i>

208
00:11:01,877 --> 00:11:04,994
Yeah, it's like, "Boy, that son of a bitch
Boggs can really hit."</i>

209
00:11:05,157 --> 00:11:06,272
- Really?
- Yeah.</i>

210
00:11:06,437 --> 00:11:08,712
That's how they talk
in the major league.</i>

211
00:11:09,717 --> 00:11:11,275
Oh, boy.

212
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:12,506
Hey.</i>

213
00:11:13,637 --> 00:11:17,710
- How many sweaters you got on?
- Four.</i>

214
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:20,914
Could I have a cup of tea,
boiling hot?</i>

215
00:11:21,277 --> 00:11:22,869
What's going on?

216
00:11:23,037 --> 00:11:26,188
I fell asleep in the hot tub,
and the heat pump broke.</i>

217
00:11:26,357 --> 00:11:28,996
Water went down to 58 degrees.</i>

218
00:11:29,157 --> 00:11:31,955
I can't get
my core temperature back up.</i>

219
00:11:32,517 --> 00:11:33,552
Your core temperature?</i>

220
00:11:33,917 --> 00:11:36,477
Here, feel my hand.
Yeah, feel.</i>

221
00:11:36,637 --> 00:11:39,390
This son of a bitch is ice cold.</i>

222
00:11:41,477 --> 00:11:43,866
- Helo?
- Is that you, George?</i>

223
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,595
Yeah, it's me. Is this Clayton?</i>

224
00:11:45,757 --> 00:11:49,147
Well, listen, you son of a bitch,
you know where we are?</i>

225
00:11:49,317 --> 00:11:52,389
Thirty thousand feet
above your head, you bastard.</i>

226
00:11:52,597 --> 00:11:54,588
What are they doing
letting you on an airplane?</i>

227
00:11:54,757 --> 00:11:56,713
Don't they know
that's against FAA regulation?</i>

228
00:11:56,877 --> 00:11:58,435
Hush up now. I can't hear.</i>

229
00:11:58,597 --> 00:12:01,634
Listen, I want you to send those
agreements the minute you land.</i>

230
00:12:01,797 --> 00:12:03,674
Our boys can't wait
to kick your butts.

231
00:12:03,837 --> 00:12:05,429
When's that bastard
coming to Houston?</i>

232
00:12:05,597 --> 00:12:08,350
Zeke wants to know when you
bastards are coming to Houston?</i>

233
00:12:08,517 --> 00:12:12,305
Hey, you tell that son of a bitch
no Yankee is ever coming to Houston.</i>

234
00:12:12,477 --> 00:12:14,627
Not as long as you bastards
are running things.</i>

235
00:12:14,797 --> 00:12:17,072
Speak up, George, I can't hear you.</i>

236
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,353
You tell that son of a bitch...</i>

237
00:12:19,517 --> 00:12:22,031
...no Yankee
is ever coming to Houston.</i>

238
00:12:22,197 --> 00:12:24,631
Not as long as you bastards
are running things.</i>

239
00:12:24,797 --> 00:12:27,072
- George! Get ahold of yourself.
- Mr. Wilhelm.</i>

240
00:12:27,237 --> 00:12:29,307
What's the matter with you?</i>

241
00:12:32,837 --> 00:12:37,308
It was a cold winter's night
in Timbuktu.</i>

242
00:12:38,237 --> 00:12:40,467
This stinks.</i>

243
00:12:41,517 --> 00:12:45,112
Come on. Come on.</i>

244
00:12:50,757 --> 00:12:52,110
- Hello.
- Hello.</i>

245
00:12:52,277 --> 00:12:54,586
- I'm a friend of Elaine's.
- Oh, hi.</i>

246
00:12:54,757 --> 00:12:59,114
Oh, look at that cute little bastard.</i>

247
00:12:59,277 --> 00:13:03,065
You are mommy's little bastard,
aren't you?</i>

248
00:13:04,797 --> 00:13:06,594
What are you doing
harassing my tenants?</i>

249
00:13:06,757 --> 00:13:10,432
Oh, come on, you son of a bitch,
I'm just trying to be friendly.</i>

250
00:13:10,717 --> 00:13:12,230
All right, that's it. Let's go.</i>

251
00:13:12,397 --> 00:13:13,830
Man, I got a race tomorrow.</i>

252
00:13:18,277 --> 00:13:20,950
- It's like a furnace in here.
- What the hell is going on?</i>

253
00:13:21,117 --> 00:13:22,106
I turned up the heat.</i>

254
00:13:22,277 --> 00:13:23,949
Turn up the heat
in your own apartment.</i>

255
00:13:24,117 --> 00:13:25,630
I'm freezing.</i>

256
00:13:25,797 --> 00:13:27,389
I just need
to get my hot tub running.</i>

257
00:13:27,917 --> 00:13:29,794
I'm waiting for my new heat pump.</i>

258
00:13:29,957 --> 00:13:31,993
Well, what's in this giant box
out in the hall?</i>

259
00:13:32,997 --> 00:13:34,828
- Oh, that must be it.
- It's huge.</i>

260
00:13:34,997 --> 00:13:38,512
Yeah, I got the biggest one they had.
Yeah, it's industrial strength.</i>

261
00:13:38,677 --> 00:13:41,475
Sixteen thousand Btu's.</i>

262
00:13:45,077 --> 00:13:46,556
Hello.</i>

263
00:13:46,717 --> 00:13:49,231
Yeah, I can be there
in 10 minutes.</i>

264
00:13:49,477 --> 00:13:51,866
You can count on me.</i>

265
00:13:52,517 --> 00:13:53,870
- What?
- I got the call.</i>

266
00:13:54,037 --> 00:13:56,028
- Jean-Paul?
- Jean-Paul.</i>

267
00:14:00,197 --> 00:14:02,108
Very lucky to find this hotel,
Jean-Paul.</i>

268
00:14:02,277 --> 00:14:03,949
Man, I just want to get some sleep.</i>

269
00:14:04,757 --> 00:14:07,555
All right.
Let's check out the clock.</i>

270
00:14:07,717 --> 00:14:09,355
Notch good.

271
00:14:09,517 --> 00:14:11,553
6:50.

272
00:14:12,037 --> 00:14:13,993
Volume check.</i>

273
00:14:18,997 --> 00:14:20,669
What kind of music
you wanna wake up to?</i>

274
00:14:20,837 --> 00:14:22,987
- Top 40, Classical?
- Man, whatever.</i>

275
00:14:23,157 --> 00:14:25,796
- How about adult contemporary?
- Fine, adult contemporary.</i>

276
00:14:25,957 --> 00:14:28,312
- Just pick one.
- All right.</i>

277
00:14:28,477 --> 00:14:32,026
We're going with adult contempo.</i>

278
00:14:33,517 --> 00:14:36,509
Now the fail-safe.</i>

279
00:14:37,157 --> 00:14:38,431
The wake-up guy.</i>

280
00:14:38,597 --> 00:14:40,747
Yes, yes, the wake-up guy.</i>

281
00:14:40,917 --> 00:14:42,794
- Front desk.
- Yes, this is room 419.</i>

282
00:14:42,957 --> 00:14:46,029
I'd like a wake-up call
for 6:50 a. m. tomorrow morning.</i>

283
00:14:46,197 --> 00:14:47,425
Yes, sir.</i>

284
00:14:47,597 --> 00:14:50,907
That's room 419, 6:50 a. m.

285
00:14:51,077 --> 00:14:53,545
Four-one-niner.</i>

286
00:14:54,157 --> 00:14:56,955
Yes, I got it, sir.
You only had to say it once.</i>

287
00:14:57,117 --> 00:15:00,393
But it's a very important wake-up call,
and I don't wanna take any chances.</i>

288
00:15:00,557 --> 00:15:02,275
Every wak e-up cal I mak e
is important.</i>

289
00:15:02,437 --> 00:15:04,473
You're no more important
than any of our guests.</i>

290
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:07,105
Well, I don't want to get into
a thing with you here, but-</i>

291
00:15:07,277 --> 00:15:10,952
- Are you through?
- Yeah, I am, but I just-</i>

292
00:15:16,637 --> 00:15:18,673
What is it?

293
00:15:18,997 --> 00:15:21,227
I think I offended the wake-up guy.</i>

294
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:23,833
- No, no.
- No, no, I did.

295
00:15:23,997 --> 00:15:26,716
- I think he's got it in for me.
- He doesn't have it in for you.</i>

296
00:15:26,877 --> 00:15:29,266
- What if he doesn't call out of spite?
- It is his job.</i>

297
00:15:34,117 --> 00:15:35,755
I'm not comfortable.</i>

298
00:15:36,197 --> 00:15:38,153
For God's sake.</i>

299
00:15:43,117 --> 00:15:44,994
Jean-Paul?</i>

300
00:15:45,797 --> 00:15:47,753
Hey, Jean-Paul?</i>

301
00:15:49,637 --> 00:15:51,389
Jean-Paul?</i>

302
00:15:53,117 --> 00:15:54,755
Jean-Paul?</i>

303
00:15:54,917 --> 00:15:56,873
Oh, man.

304
00:16:00,357 --> 00:16:03,394
- Oh, machine.
- I'm not here. Leave a message.</i>

305
00:16:03,557 --> 00:16:07,914
Jerry, Jerry, Jean-Paul is missing.
He's alone in the city. Call me back.</i>

306
00:16:13,797 --> 00:16:16,994
- Judy, hi, listen-
- You have got some nerve, Elaine.</i>

307
00:16:17,157 --> 00:16:19,625
I told you about that baby
in confidence.</i>

308
00:16:20,357 --> 00:16:21,631
Oh, I didn't tell anyone.</i>

309
00:16:22,557 --> 00:16:25,993
Well, your friend certainly seemed
to know all about it.</i>

310
00:16:28,917 --> 00:16:30,589
Jerry!</i>

311
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,267
I feel much better here
at my home base, Jean-Paul.</i>

312
00:16:35,437 --> 00:16:36,836
It's a controlled environment.</i>

313
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:38,874
It's a marathon, you know?
Twenty-six miles.</i>

314
00:16:39,037 --> 00:16:40,186
I need to get some sleep.</i>

315
00:16:40,437 --> 00:16:43,235
Hey, believe me, if I had been
with you there in Barcelona...</i>

316
00:16:43,397 --> 00:16:46,434
...you'd be polishing that medal
right now.</i>

317
00:16:47,077 --> 00:16:49,545
I left a comfortable hotel bed for this.</i>

318
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,867
That wake-up guy was trouble.</i>

319
00:16:52,397 --> 00:16:54,308
All right, I'll be right back.</i>

320
00:17:03,917 --> 00:17:05,145
Man, that thing is noisy.

321
00:17:05,317 --> 00:17:09,151
We're cranking along pretty good.
We're almost up to 80 degrees.</i>

322
00:17:09,317 --> 00:17:12,673
Listen, do me a favour, set your mental
alarm for 6:30 and give me a call.</i>

323
00:17:12,837 --> 00:17:14,395
Okay.

324
00:17:16,997 --> 00:17:18,191
Done.</i>

325
00:17:19,717 --> 00:17:23,266
He's put his faith in you.
He's put his faith in you.</i>

326
00:17:23,437 --> 00:17:25,473
I trust Elaine, she is my friend.</i>

327
00:17:25,637 --> 00:17:27,548
I trust Elaine, she is my friend.</i>

328
00:17:28,157 --> 00:17:29,954
Frankly, I'm a little concerned.</i>

329
00:17:31,997 --> 00:17:33,794
I'm exhausted.</i>

330
00:17:33,957 --> 00:17:36,630
I've been on this street
1000 times.</i>

331
00:17:36,797 --> 00:17:39,027
It's never look ed so strange.</i>

332
00:17:39,197 --> 00:17:41,472
The faces, so cold.</i>

333
00:17:42,797 --> 00:17:45,265
In the distance, a child is crying.</i>

334
00:17:45,437 --> 00:17:46,756
Fatherless.</i>

335
00:17:46,917 --> 00:17:49,306
A bastard child, perhaps.</i>

336
00:17:49,757 --> 00:17:51,713
My back aches.</i>

337
00:17:51,877 --> 00:17:54,437
My heart aches, but my feet...</i>

338
00:17:56,277 --> 00:17:59,587
My feet are resilient.</i>

339
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:03,996
Thank God I took off my heels
and put on my...</i>

340
00:18:04,157 --> 00:18:06,432
...Himalayan walking shoes!</i>

341
00:18:43,237 --> 00:18:45,148
4:02?

342
00:18:47,237 --> 00:18:49,797
8:47? Jean-Paul!
Wake up, wake up!</i>

343
00:18:50,237 --> 00:18:53,627
Jean-Paul, the electricity went out!
Wake up, wake up, we've gotta go!</i>

344
00:18:53,797 --> 00:18:56,027
- It's 8:47!
-8:47?

345
00:18:56,517 --> 00:18:59,554
Come on. Just put your clothes on.
You'll get dressed in the car.</i>

346
00:19:00,517 --> 00:19:02,428
Idiot, I trusted you!</i>

347
00:19:02,837 --> 00:19:04,907
Kramer, what happened?
The electricity went out.</i>

348
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:07,466
Yeah, the heat pump
blew all the fuses.</i>

349
00:19:07,837 --> 00:19:09,634
What happened to your mental alarm?</i>

350
00:19:10,277 --> 00:19:11,869
Well, I guess I hit the snooze.</i>

351
00:19:30,917 --> 00:19:32,828
Make way. Watch out.
I've got a runner here.</i>

352
00:19:32,997 --> 00:19:34,146
Get out of the way.</i>

353
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:36,873
Make way, make way.
Make way, he's a contender.</i>

354
00:19:37,037 --> 00:19:39,949
- Hey, hold it.
- I'm late, man. I'm in the race.</i>

355
00:19:40,117 --> 00:19:41,516
- Go ahead.
- Thank you, Jerry.</i>

356
00:19:41,677 --> 00:19:43,713
You're a wonderful driver.
Fantastic route, man.</i>

357
00:19:43,877 --> 00:19:45,868
All right, go.
It's a race. Come on.</i>

358
00:19:48,197 --> 00:19:51,155
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes, George, come in, come in.</i>

359
00:19:51,317 --> 00:19:53,672
Word has it you've been
cracking under the pressure.</i>

360
00:19:53,837 --> 00:19:55,828
Can't cope, can't stand the heat.
Spit the bit.</i>

361
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:57,636
Mr. Steinbrenner, I can explain-</i>

362
00:19:57,797 --> 00:19:59,992
We all get a little cuckoo.
I used to be like you.</i>

363
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:02,990
Berating personnel, calling managers
on the field during a game.</i>

364
00:20:03,157 --> 00:20:05,717
Threatening to move the team
to New Jersey to upset people.</i>

365
00:20:05,877 --> 00:20:07,071
Then I found a way to relax.</i>

366
00:20:07,237 --> 00:20:08,989
I've got two words
to say to you, George.</i>

367
00:20:09,157 --> 00:20:10,715
Hot tub.

368
00:20:12,437 --> 00:20:14,667
I'm telling you, I never told
anyone about that baby.</i>

369
00:20:14,837 --> 00:20:16,350
I never even went near your building.</i>

370
00:20:16,517 --> 00:20:19,475
- Then how did she find out, Jerry?
- You should check with the rabbi.</i>

371
00:20:20,037 --> 00:20:22,870
- You want some hot tea?
- Oh, no, thank you.</i>

372
00:20:23,037 --> 00:20:24,914
Oh, there's some runners.
Here they come.</i>

373
00:20:28,037 --> 00:20:29,868
There's Jean-Paul.
He's out front.</i>

374
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:34,111
- He's leading! Go, Jean-Paul!
- Yeah!</i>

375
00:20:34,277 --> 00:20:35,392
Come on!</i>

376
00:20:39,557 --> 00:20:42,594
- One mile to go, Jean-Paul.
- Go, Jean-Paul!</i>

377
00:21:08,477 --> 00:21:11,833
How are you enjoying it, George?
Melts that tension away, doesn't it?</i>

378
00:21:11,997 --> 00:21:14,591
You gotta get that jet
on the good spot.</i>

379
00:21:14,757 --> 00:21:17,066
Yes, that feels good.
Yes, that's real good.</i>

380
00:21:17,237 --> 00:21:18,955
Yeah, that's where I keep
all my tension.</i>

381
00:21:19,117 --> 00:21:20,391
Right under that chicken bone.</i>

382
00:21:20,557 --> 00:21:23,390
I get my wife to stick her thumb
right in there like a screwdriver.</i>

383
00:21:23,557 --> 00:21:25,115
The Phillips head, not the flat one.</i>

384
00:21:25,277 --> 00:21:27,188
Oh, God, those flat ones
frustrate me.</i>

385
00:21:27,357 --> 00:21:30,474
You got it in, but it slips out.
Put it in again, it slips out again.

386
00:21:30,637 --> 00:21:33,151
- You a single man, George?
- Well, I just recently-</i>

387
00:21:33,317 --> 00:21:35,547
You wanna get something wild
going on in your life...</i>

388
00:21:35,717 --> 00:21:37,389
...get a girl and
bring her in one of these.</i>

389
00:21:37,557 --> 00:21:39,195
It's like four shots of Wild Turkey.</i>

390
00:21:39,357 --> 00:21:41,075
She'll think you're Hopalong Cassidy.</i>

391
00:21:41,237 --> 00:21:43,148
Terrible about that Mickey Mantle,
wasn't it?</i>

392
00:21:43,317 --> 00:21:46,195
You know, we used to talk.
I don't think he liked me very much.</i>
