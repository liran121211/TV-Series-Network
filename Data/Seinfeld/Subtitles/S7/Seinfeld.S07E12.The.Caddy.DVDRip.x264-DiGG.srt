1
00:00:02,877 --> 00:00:04,071
Why are people surprised...

2
00:00:05,597 --> 00:00:07,872
...when someone
gets hit with a golf ball?

3
00:00:08,037 --> 00:00:09,789
Have you watched
the tournaments on TV?

4
00:00:09,957 --> 00:00:12,835
You got 600 people
crowding around a hole that big...

5
00:00:12,997 --> 00:00:14,874
...and no one believes it
when a Titleist...

6
00:00:15,037 --> 00:00:16,789
...bounces off someone's coconut.

7
00:00:16,957 --> 00:00:20,472
You know, you throw a rock into
a crowd, that's considered terrorism.

8
00:00:20,637 --> 00:00:24,915
But if you have a nice follow-through,
you know, that's golf.

9
00:00:25,357 --> 00:00:27,473
I'm always impressed
with the golf cameraman...

10
00:00:27,637 --> 00:00:31,425
...whose job it is to follow the golf ball
when it's in the sky.

11
00:00:31,597 --> 00:00:34,714
It's a little white ball doing 100 miles
an hour on a white background.

12
00:00:34,877 --> 00:00:37,072
"I got it. I lost it. I got it. I lost it."

13
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:39,797
Why bother? Aim the camera
at the sky. Aim it at the ground.

14
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:41,868
Take a ball out of your pocket.
Throw it down.

15
00:00:42,037 --> 00:00:44,232
Who's gonna know
where the hell it came from?

16
00:00:48,477 --> 00:00:50,229
How did you lock your keys
in your car?

17
00:00:50,397 --> 00:00:51,989
How? Because I'm an idiot.

18
00:00:53,437 --> 00:00:55,473
- Why didn't you get a locksmith?
- I was going to.

19
00:00:55,637 --> 00:00:59,186
Then I found out the Auto Club has
free locksmith service, so I signed up.

20
00:00:59,357 --> 00:01:01,917
Just waiting
for the membership to kick in.

21
00:01:03,357 --> 00:01:06,155
How long has your car been sitting
in the Yankee parking lot?

22
00:01:06,517 --> 00:01:08,906
I don't know. About three days.

23
00:01:11,877 --> 00:01:13,435
Hello, boys.

24
00:01:14,037 --> 00:01:16,346
- You're not playing golf?
- Yes, indeed.

25
00:01:16,517 --> 00:01:19,350
Calendar says winter,
but the gods of spring are out.

26
00:01:19,517 --> 00:01:22,350
- And the course is open?
- No, no.

27
00:01:23,477 --> 00:01:26,867
I sneak in with Stan the Caddy.
We go through the caddies' entrance.

28
00:01:27,037 --> 00:01:28,789
- No kidding.
- I'll tell you something else.

29
00:01:28,957 --> 00:01:32,552
Stan's advice has transformed
my game. He's never wrong.

30
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:36,995
He thinks eventually I'll have a shot
at making it big on the Senior Tour.

31
00:01:37,157 --> 00:01:38,476
Oh, that's my dream, Jerry.

32
00:01:38,637 --> 00:01:42,596
- Really, you're getting that good?
- Oh, I'm the real deal.

33
00:01:44,397 --> 00:01:47,514
Yeah, here, Stan. In here.
There he is.

34
00:01:47,677 --> 00:01:50,237
Jerry, George, this is Stan the Caddy.

35
00:01:50,397 --> 00:01:51,796
- How you doing?
- Hi.

36
00:01:51,957 --> 00:01:52,946
Nice to meet you.

37
00:01:53,117 --> 00:01:54,789
- Ready to hit the links?
- You betcha.

38
00:01:56,997 --> 00:01:59,750
- What are those, cotton pants?
- Yeah, yeah.

39
00:01:59,917 --> 00:02:01,111
What, is it too cold out?

40
00:02:02,117 --> 00:02:04,506
Here's what you do.
You bring a lightweight jacket.

41
00:02:04,677 --> 00:02:07,589
That way, the sun comes out,
you play the jacket off the sweater.

42
00:02:07,757 --> 00:02:10,635
Oh, that makes sense.
That's a good call, Stan.

43
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,230
All right. We'll see you later.

44
00:02:12,397 --> 00:02:14,388
- Yeah, we'll see you.
- See you.

45
00:02:16,277 --> 00:02:18,393
- Stan the Caddy.
- Stan the Caddy.

46
00:02:20,317 --> 00:02:21,466
Elaine?

47
00:02:23,117 --> 00:02:24,436
Hi.

48
00:02:24,597 --> 00:02:28,226
Oh, great. It's the bra/ess wonder.

49
00:02:28,397 --> 00:02:30,069
Who does she think she's kidding?

50
00:02:30,237 --> 00:02:32,751
Look at her,
she's tota//y out of contro/.

51
00:02:32,917 --> 00:02:35,590
I was thinking, "That woman
looks like Elaine Benes."

52
00:02:35,757 --> 00:02:38,225
Yeah. What have you been up to?

53
00:02:38,397 --> 00:02:41,036
- Just been hanging out.
- I see.

54
00:02:41,197 --> 00:02:43,427
Listen, I'm having a birthday party
tomorrow evening.

55
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:46,065
- I'd love it if you came by.
- Oh, tomorrow.

56
00:02:46,237 --> 00:02:47,875
- I don't know if I can.
- No?

57
00:02:48,037 --> 00:02:52,872
- No, I'm just really, really busy.
- Oh, that's too bad.

58
00:02:53,037 --> 00:02:54,948
Well, I hope you can
get me a gift anyway.

59
00:03:00,837 --> 00:03:02,714
- George.
- Mr. Wilhelm.

60
00:03:03,477 --> 00:03:05,911
I'm sorry to interrupt you,
but Mr. Steinbrenner and I...

61
00:03:06,077 --> 00:03:09,114
...want you to know we appreciate
all the hours you've been putting in.

62
00:03:09,277 --> 00:03:11,313
Oh, and confidentially...

63
00:03:11,477 --> 00:03:15,152
...Sozonkel, assistant to the general
manager, hasn't been working out...

64
00:03:15,317 --> 00:03:17,626
...and the boss thinks
you're the man for the job.

65
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:20,231
So keep it under your hat.

66
00:03:25,237 --> 00:03:28,149
Assistant to the general manager!
Do you know what that means?

67
00:03:28,317 --> 00:03:30,547
He could be asking my advice
on trades.

68
00:03:30,717 --> 00:03:32,947
Trades, Jerry. I'm a heartbeat away.

69
00:03:34,077 --> 00:03:36,545
That's a hell of an organization
they're running up there.

70
00:03:37,397 --> 00:03:40,707
I can't understand why they haven't
won a pennant in 15 years.

71
00:03:40,877 --> 00:03:43,311
And it is all because of that car.

72
00:03:43,477 --> 00:03:46,310
See, Steinbrenner is, like,
the first guy in at the crack of dawn.

73
00:03:46,477 --> 00:03:49,071
He sees my car.
He figures I'm the first guy in.

74
00:03:49,237 --> 00:03:52,035
Then the /ast person to /eave
is Wi/he/m.

75
00:03:52,197 --> 00:03:54,950
He sees my car. He figures
I'm burning the midnight oi/.

76
00:03:55,117 --> 00:03:57,915
Between the two of them, they
think I'm working an 18-hour day.

77
00:03:59,757 --> 00:04:03,272
Locking your keys in your car is
the best career move you ever made.

78
00:04:03,997 --> 00:04:05,715
- Hey.
- Hey. How you doing?

79
00:04:05,877 --> 00:04:08,232
- Better now.
- Yeah? What happened?

80
00:04:08,397 --> 00:04:10,991
- You know Sue Ellen Mischke?
- Sue Ellen Mischke?

81
00:04:11,157 --> 00:04:13,148
Yeah, the woman I grew up with
in Maryland.

82
00:04:13,317 --> 00:04:15,547
- She moved here last year.
- Sounds familiar.

83
00:04:15,717 --> 00:04:18,277
The heiress to the
Oh Henry! Candy-bar fortune?

84
00:04:18,437 --> 00:04:20,905
- You mentioned her.
- Yes. I ran into her today.

85
00:04:21,277 --> 00:04:25,907
This woman has never, not once ever,
as long as I have known her...

86
00:04:26,077 --> 00:04:27,795
...worn a bra.

87
00:04:27,957 --> 00:04:30,517
- That is shameless.
- Well, she's disgusting. She's a pig.

88
00:04:30,677 --> 00:04:32,907
- There's no reason. That's wrong.
- The woman's a pig.

89
00:04:33,077 --> 00:04:35,033
- It's rude.
- All right. There's no point.

90
00:04:35,197 --> 00:04:38,109
- Come on. Come on. We're sorry.
- We're only kidding.

91
00:04:38,277 --> 00:04:40,586
You don't understand.
See, she hasn't changed at all.

92
00:04:40,757 --> 00:04:43,351
She stole my boyfriend
when I was in high school.

93
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:46,156
I was at this party, and I was
dating this rea//y cute guy.

94
00:04:46,317 --> 00:04:47,989
His name was
Tom Cos/ey, by the way.

95
00:04:48,157 --> 00:04:50,955
And she goes wa/king by
in this /itt/e f/oozy outfit...

96
00:04:51,117 --> 00:04:53,187
... and he fo//ows her
right out the door.

97
00:04:54,517 --> 00:04:56,633
She's your Lex Luthor.

98
00:04:57,277 --> 00:05:01,714
Her birthday's coming up, see?
So I decided to get her a little present.

99
00:05:01,877 --> 00:05:04,437
- What are you gonna get her?
- A very traditional...

100
00:05:04,597 --> 00:05:06,588
...a very supportive...

101
00:05:06,757 --> 00:05:08,475
...brassiere.

102
00:05:09,197 --> 00:05:13,031
- There's nothing subtle about that.
- No, no, she might just think it's a gift.

103
00:05:13,197 --> 00:05:15,916
Have I ever bought you
a jockstrap as a gift?

104
00:05:18,997 --> 00:05:20,635
Hey.

105
00:05:21,277 --> 00:05:23,745
What are you doing here?
Aren't you supposed to be at work?

106
00:05:23,917 --> 00:05:26,226
I'm thinking of leaving town
with Susan for a few days.

107
00:05:26,397 --> 00:05:27,750
Her parents rebuilt the cabin.

108
00:05:29,237 --> 00:05:30,750
So you're just taking off from work?

109
00:05:30,917 --> 00:05:34,068
Yeah, well, they won't know.
I got the car there.

110
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:38,068
Is this a good idea, with you being
on the verge of this big promotion?

111
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:41,707
My presence in that office
can only hurt my chances.

112
00:05:43,997 --> 00:05:46,511
Sue E//en Mischk e to see you.

113
00:05:46,677 --> 00:05:48,952
Sue Ellen Mischke?

114
00:05:49,477 --> 00:05:51,672
All right. Send her in.

115
00:05:53,637 --> 00:05:55,468
Hi, Elaine.

116
00:05:55,677 --> 00:05:57,395
Hello.

117
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:58,785
I was in the neighbourhood...

118
00:05:58,957 --> 00:06:02,029
...so I thought I'd stop in
and thank you for your lovely gift.

119
00:06:02,837 --> 00:06:06,716
Oh, you're welcome.

120
00:06:06,877 --> 00:06:08,708
Is anything wrong?

121
00:06:09,037 --> 00:06:11,551
Well, Sue Ellen, it's...

122
00:06:11,717 --> 00:06:13,992
It's not a top.

123
00:06:14,157 --> 00:06:15,510
It's a bra.

124
00:06:16,077 --> 00:06:17,351
Oh, I know.

125
00:06:17,517 --> 00:06:19,587
Thanks again.

126
00:06:23,077 --> 00:06:25,466
This is the life, isn't it, huh, kid?

127
00:06:25,637 --> 00:06:28,549
- You wanna check out a swap meet?
- Yeah, maybe.

128
00:06:28,717 --> 00:06:30,912
- Where'd you get that?
- It was on the windshield...

129
00:06:31,077 --> 00:06:33,545
...when we came out
of that rest stop.

130
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:40,109
- Hello.
- Hey, hey, it's George.

131
00:06:40,277 --> 00:06:41,915
- I need a favour.
- What's going on?

132
00:06:42,077 --> 00:06:44,830
I just remembered. There's a
restaurant near Yankee stadium...

133
00:06:44,997 --> 00:06:47,147
...that puts fliers on all the cars.
- Yeah, so?

134
00:06:47,317 --> 00:06:50,992
This is what you gotta do. Go to the
parking lot, take the fliers off my car.

135
00:06:51,157 --> 00:06:53,796
Last time you had me throwing
bread up three floors to you.

136
00:06:53,957 --> 00:06:55,549
Now you want me
to go to the Bronx...

137
00:06:55,717 --> 00:06:58,026
...take fliers off your car.
Where does it end?

138
00:06:58,197 --> 00:07:02,349
All right, fine. I'll drive the three hours
each way and take them off myself.

139
00:07:02,517 --> 00:07:04,633
All right. I'll do it.

140
00:07:05,157 --> 00:07:06,670
- Hey, what are you up to?
- Nothing.

141
00:07:06,837 --> 00:07:09,271
You wanna go to the Bronx
and see if there's fliers...

142
00:07:09,437 --> 00:07:11,029
...on George's car?
- Sure.

143
00:07:13,037 --> 00:07:15,756
- I could have said just about anything.
- Yeah.

144
00:07:24,157 --> 00:07:27,308
Oh, man, look at this mess.

145
00:07:27,477 --> 00:07:29,468
You know what will happen
if they see this?

146
00:07:29,637 --> 00:07:30,865
What are we gonna do?

147
00:07:31,037 --> 00:07:33,346
- I don't know.
- Well, we gotta get it washed.

148
00:07:34,477 --> 00:07:36,832
Oh, the keys are locked inside.

149
00:07:39,077 --> 00:07:40,795
Wait a second.

150
00:07:40,957 --> 00:07:44,632
- What are you gonna do?
- I'll just snag the lock with this.

151
00:07:45,037 --> 00:07:47,073
There we go.

152
00:07:47,837 --> 00:07:50,192
This is quite a life I lead here.

153
00:07:53,957 --> 00:07:56,869
- George has to be happy about this.
- Yeah, yeah.

154
00:07:57,597 --> 00:07:59,906
Oh, my God, Kramer,
is that woman just wearing a bra?

155
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:02,274
Oh, mama.

156
00:08:03,757 --> 00:08:05,156
Kramer!

157
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:13,029
My God, are you okay?

158
00:08:13,197 --> 00:08:15,267
I got a cut on my head
and I banged my shoulder.

159
00:08:15,437 --> 00:08:18,952
I guess I have to bring his car back up
to the stadium. If it can make it.

160
00:08:19,117 --> 00:08:21,677
- So how did this happen?
- He was staring at some woman.

161
00:08:21,837 --> 00:08:24,305
Well, I couldn't help it.
You saw what she was wearing.

162
00:08:25,157 --> 00:08:27,034
- What woman?
- There was a beautiful woman...

163
00:08:27,197 --> 00:08:29,108
...walking down the street
wearing just a bra.

164
00:08:29,277 --> 00:08:31,427
I can't get that image
out of my mind.

165
00:08:32,797 --> 00:08:35,231
- Oh, my God.
- What?

166
00:08:35,397 --> 00:08:38,389
- Was it a tall woman in a black blazer?
- Yeah.

167
00:08:40,117 --> 00:08:42,631
- That's Sue Ellen Mischke.
- Sue Ellen Mischke?

168
00:08:42,797 --> 00:08:46,836
That's the bra I gave her.
She's wearing it as a top.

169
00:08:47,517 --> 00:08:50,634
A woman is walking around in broad
daylight with nothing but a bra on.

170
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:53,436
She's a menace to society.

171
00:08:53,997 --> 00:08:56,352
Hey, you know, my arm really hurts.

172
00:08:56,797 --> 00:08:58,867
I wonder if it's gonna affect
my golf swing.

173
00:09:03,397 --> 00:09:05,353
I got your message.
How's the shoulder?

174
00:09:05,517 --> 00:09:08,987
- It's my left arm. I can't swing it.
- Oh, no, not the left arm!

175
00:09:09,157 --> 00:09:11,034
What happens if I can't play
like I was?

176
00:09:11,197 --> 00:09:13,506
What about the tour
and all my dreams?

177
00:09:14,957 --> 00:09:16,276
I got it!

178
00:09:16,437 --> 00:09:17,995
Let's sue her.

179
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:20,717
- Sue her?
- Yeah, she's loaded.

180
00:09:20,877 --> 00:09:23,152
She's the heiress to the
Oh Henry! Candy-bar fortune.

181
00:09:23,317 --> 00:09:25,672
I can't. I learned my lesson
from that coffee company.

182
00:09:25,837 --> 00:09:27,475
Kramer, listen to me.

183
00:09:27,637 --> 00:09:30,071
Listen. This is
a once- in-a-lifetime opportunity.

184
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:31,590
Your dreams have been shattered.

185
00:09:31,757 --> 00:09:33,748
Somebody's gotta be
held accountable.

186
00:09:33,917 --> 00:09:37,273
Come on. We'll take her
for every penny she's got.

187
00:09:39,237 --> 00:09:41,307
What do you think, Stan?

188
00:09:42,117 --> 00:09:44,472
Let's go for the green.

189
00:09:44,997 --> 00:09:46,749
You know a good lawyer?

190
00:09:48,557 --> 00:09:49,831
So you're driving in the car.

191
00:09:49,997 --> 00:09:52,591
You're with your friend,
minding your own business.

192
00:09:52,757 --> 00:09:54,509
- Then what happened?
- We saw this woman...

193
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,747
...and she was wearing a bra
with no top.

194
00:09:56,917 --> 00:09:58,873
No top? She didn't have a top on?

195
00:09:59,037 --> 00:10:02,393
Yeah, so I got distracted
and I crashed the car.

196
00:10:02,557 --> 00:10:04,036
How would you describe
this woman?

197
00:10:04,197 --> 00:10:05,755
Would you say she was attractive?

198
00:10:06,237 --> 00:10:08,626
- Oh, yeah.
- So we got an attractive woman...

199
00:10:08,797 --> 00:10:11,675
...wearing a bra, no top,
walking around in broad daylight.

200
00:10:11,837 --> 00:10:13,429
She's flouting society's conventions.

201
00:10:13,597 --> 00:10:15,986
- She was flouting.
- That's totally inappropriate.

202
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:19,672
It's lewd, lascivious, salacious,
outrageous.

203
00:10:19,837 --> 00:10:21,156
It was outrageous.

204
00:10:21,317 --> 00:10:23,990
And she's the heir to
the Oh Henry! Candy-bar fortune.

205
00:10:24,597 --> 00:10:26,508
Could you repeat that?

206
00:10:26,677 --> 00:10:29,589
I said, she's the heir to
the Oh Henry! Candy-bar fortune.

207
00:10:29,757 --> 00:10:31,429
Oh Henry!?

208
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,833
That's one of our
top-selling candy bars.

209
00:10:33,997 --> 00:10:36,386
It's got chocolate, peanuts, nougat.

210
00:10:36,557 --> 00:10:39,435
It's delicious, scrumptious,
outstanding.

211
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,827
- Have you been to a doctor?
- No.

212
00:10:41,997 --> 00:10:46,070
Suzy, call Dr. Bison.
Set up an appointment for Mr. Kramer.

213
00:10:46,237 --> 00:10:48,432
Tell him it's for me.

214
00:10:49,117 --> 00:10:51,506
So, what do you think, Jackie?
I mean, we got a case?

215
00:10:51,997 --> 00:10:53,430
Like taking candy from a baby.

216
00:10:58,877 --> 00:11:00,629
I think I got it. How about this?

217
00:11:00,797 --> 00:11:02,867
We trade Jim Leyritz
and Bernie Williams...

218
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,868
...for Barry Bonds.
What do you think?

219
00:11:05,037 --> 00:11:07,232
Then I have Griffey and
Bonds in the same outfield.

220
00:11:07,397 --> 00:11:08,796
Now you got a team.

221
00:11:08,957 --> 00:11:11,869
I don't know, George.
I'm still worried about this car thing.

222
00:11:12,037 --> 00:11:14,870
- Would you stop worrying?
- Well, what about the fliers?

223
00:11:15,037 --> 00:11:19,827
Jerry took the fliers off the car.
I got the whole thing covered.

224
00:11:43,517 --> 00:11:45,030
Come in.

225
00:11:45,477 --> 00:11:46,876
- Wilhelm.
- Mr. Steinbrenner...

226
00:11:47,037 --> 00:11:49,267
...I am very concerned about
George Costanza.

227
00:11:49,437 --> 00:11:51,997
- How about a "good morning"?
- Yes, sir. Good morning, sir.

228
00:11:52,157 --> 00:11:53,146
Good morning, Wilhelm.

229
00:11:53,317 --> 00:11:56,832
Anyway, his car is in the parking lot,
the front end is bashed in...

230
00:11:56,997 --> 00:11:59,716
...and there's blood in the car,
and we can't find him anywhere.

231
00:11:59,877 --> 00:12:02,789
Obviously, he was in some sort of
a terrible car accident...

232
00:12:02,957 --> 00:12:06,074
...and trouper that he is,
he tried to make it into work, sir.

233
00:12:06,237 --> 00:12:08,307
Wilhelm, listen to me.
I want the stadium scoured.

234
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:10,035
He could be bleeding in the bullpen.

235
00:12:10,197 --> 00:12:12,791
Everyone on alert.
Check hospitals, clinics, shelters.

236
00:12:12,957 --> 00:12:14,675
- We've gotta find that kid.
- Yes, sir.

237
00:12:14,837 --> 00:12:16,395
- We must find George.
- Yes, sir.

238
00:12:16,557 --> 00:12:18,548
- Find him, Wilhelm.
- Yes, sir.

239
00:12:25,917 --> 00:12:28,306
Excuse me. Do you know
the gentleman across the hall?

240
00:12:30,077 --> 00:12:31,510
Yes. Yes, I do.

241
00:12:31,997 --> 00:12:33,749
Do you know if he'll
be back anytime soon?

242
00:12:34,317 --> 00:12:36,592
No, I don't.

243
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:39,152
Is there something
I can help you with?

244
00:12:39,317 --> 00:12:41,592
No, I really just needed
to speak with him.

245
00:12:42,237 --> 00:12:44,307
Well, you can wait for him in here
if you like.

246
00:12:46,077 --> 00:12:48,386
Well, maybe I will.

247
00:12:48,557 --> 00:12:50,787
- Lf you don't mind.
- No, no, not at all.

248
00:12:50,957 --> 00:12:52,868
- Thanks.
- I'm Jerry Seinfeld.

249
00:12:55,397 --> 00:12:58,469
What is with these people?
All day long. Come in. Come in.

250
00:13:01,677 --> 00:13:03,986
Mr. Steinbrenner, you know,
we've searched everywhere.

251
00:13:04,157 --> 00:13:05,510
There's no sign of him.

252
00:13:05,677 --> 00:13:08,953
Not even anyone who
remotely fits his description, sir.

253
00:13:09,117 --> 00:13:10,675
Oh, my God.

254
00:13:10,837 --> 00:13:12,828
- Do you know what this means?
- What, sir?

255
00:13:12,997 --> 00:13:15,636
He's dead. Costanza's dead.

256
00:13:15,797 --> 00:13:18,550
- No, no, sir. You see...
- As quickly as he came, he's gone.

257
00:13:18,717 --> 00:13:20,912
The poor little guy.

258
00:13:21,077 --> 00:13:23,307
Easy, Big Stein, get it together.

259
00:13:23,477 --> 00:13:24,705
- Okay, Wilhelm.
- Yes, sir.

260
00:13:24,877 --> 00:13:27,835
Find out where his parents live.
I'm gonna personally notify them.

261
00:13:27,997 --> 00:13:31,148
And line up some candidates
to fill that assistant position.

262
00:13:31,317 --> 00:13:32,875
- Yes, sir.
- We can't grieve forever.

263
00:13:33,037 --> 00:13:34,311
Gotta get back to business.

264
00:13:34,477 --> 00:13:36,752
- Back to business, Wilhelm.
- Yes, sir.

265
00:13:39,357 --> 00:13:41,632
Well, buddy, he's taking the case.

266
00:13:41,797 --> 00:13:45,676
Jackie Chiles is right on it.
Right on it. He's all over it.

267
00:13:46,277 --> 00:13:48,950
- Oh, really?
- Why? What's wrong? Come on.

268
00:13:49,117 --> 00:13:51,836
I don't know. So the woman was
walking around in a bra.

269
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,431
I mean, it's no big deal.
You're still driving.

270
00:13:54,597 --> 00:13:56,667
You should have been
watching the road.

271
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:58,907
Well, your attitude
has certainly changed.

272
00:13:59,077 --> 00:14:00,590
I don't think it's changed.

273
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,349
Listen, I'm gonna need you
to testify.

274
00:14:02,517 --> 00:14:05,270
- I don't know if I can.
- Jerry, you gotta testify.

275
00:14:05,437 --> 00:14:06,870
- Kramer, I don't think l...
- Listen.

276
00:14:07,037 --> 00:14:11,269
This is a million dollars we're talking
about, Jerry. This is the big league.

277
00:14:11,437 --> 00:14:16,272
- I need you on my team, Jerry.
- Well, I'm not sure how I feel about it.

278
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:19,866
All right, what's gotten into you?
What's happened?

279
00:14:20,917 --> 00:14:23,192
Nothing's happened.

280
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:30,476
What's this?

281
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:34,516
- No, wait a second. Wait a second.
- Oh, I see. Yes.

282
00:14:34,677 --> 00:14:37,589
Little Miss Candy Bar
paid a visit, didn't she?

283
00:14:37,757 --> 00:14:41,193
- Kramer, it is not what you think.
- I know what I think.

284
00:14:41,357 --> 00:14:43,996
I think you're gaga over this dame.

285
00:14:44,157 --> 00:14:46,387
She's twisted you around
her little finger...

286
00:14:46,557 --> 00:14:49,469
...and now you're willing to sell
me and Elaine...

287
00:14:49,637 --> 00:14:52,310
...and whoever else you have to
right down the river.

288
00:14:52,477 --> 00:14:53,876
And what about you?

289
00:14:54,037 --> 00:14:56,756
Trying to bilk an innocent bystander
out of a family fortune...

290
00:14:56,917 --> 00:15:00,307
...built on sweat and toil manufacturing
quality Oh Henry! Candy bars...

291
00:15:00,477 --> 00:15:03,355
...for honest, hardworking Americans.
- You're just out for sex!

292
00:15:03,517 --> 00:15:04,745
You're just out for money!

293
00:15:12,997 --> 00:15:15,033
- Mrs. Costanza?
- Yes.

294
00:15:15,197 --> 00:15:16,471
My name is George Steinbrenner.

295
00:15:16,637 --> 00:15:19,674
I'm afraid I have some very sad news
about your son.

296
00:15:20,957 --> 00:15:25,428
I can't believe it. He was so young.
How could this have happened?

297
00:15:25,597 --> 00:15:26,996
He'd been logging heavy hours.

298
00:15:27,157 --> 00:15:30,308
First one in, last one to leave.
The kid was a human dynamo.

299
00:15:30,477 --> 00:15:33,196
Are you sure you're talking
about George?

300
00:15:33,357 --> 00:15:34,790
You are Mr. And Mrs. Costanza?

301
00:15:35,277 --> 00:15:37,745
What the hell did you
trade Jay Buhner for?

302
00:15:37,917 --> 00:15:41,432
He had 30 home runs
and over 100 RBls last year.

303
00:15:41,597 --> 00:15:43,349
He's got a rocket for an arm.

304
00:15:43,517 --> 00:15:46,031
You don't know what the hell
you're doing!

305
00:15:46,197 --> 00:15:48,347
Buhner was a good prospect.
No question about it.

306
00:15:48,517 --> 00:15:50,473
But my baseball people
loved Ken Phelps' bat.

307
00:15:50,637 --> 00:15:52,070
They kept saying, "Ken Phelps."

308
00:15:52,477 --> 00:15:54,195
I'm not here. Leave a message.

309
00:15:54,357 --> 00:15:55,790
Jerry, it's Frank Costanza.

310
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:59,592
Mr. Steinbrenner's here.
George is dead. Ca// me back.

311
00:16:05,357 --> 00:16:07,154
- Hello?
- Hey, it's George.

312
00:16:07,317 --> 00:16:08,875
- Where have you been?
- What?

313
00:16:09,037 --> 00:16:11,028
I just got a bizarre message
from your father.

314
00:16:11,197 --> 00:16:13,427
Steinbrenner's at your house.
They think you're dead.

315
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,986
- Dead?
- And we had an accident with the car.

316
00:16:16,157 --> 00:16:18,193
It's a little crumpled.

317
00:16:18,357 --> 00:16:20,188
- My car's a little crumpled?
- Yeah, yeah.

318
00:16:20,357 --> 00:16:22,871
I didn't know what to do,
so I put it back at the stadium.

319
00:16:23,197 --> 00:16:24,596
Wait a second. Wait a second.

320
00:16:24,757 --> 00:16:28,670
They saw the car and the blood, that's
why Steinbrenner thinks you're dead.

321
00:16:28,837 --> 00:16:31,988
I gotta head back right away.
I gotta figure something out here.

322
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:35,115
- You gotta call your parents.
- I can't. Steinbrenner might be there.

323
00:16:35,277 --> 00:16:37,745
Aren't you gonna tell your parents
you're still alive?

324
00:16:37,917 --> 00:16:38,952
They could use the break.

325
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:46,712
Elaine, do you see this?

326
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:49,588
Do you see what I'm holding
in my hands?

327
00:16:49,957 --> 00:16:51,515
Yeah, it's a bra.

328
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:56,190
I saw a woman in our hallway
wearing one of these as a top.

329
00:16:56,357 --> 00:16:57,949
What exquisite beauty.

330
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:00,153
I ran down the hallway
to talk to her...

331
00:17:00,317 --> 00:17:03,627
...but the elevator door closed.
It was not to be.

332
00:17:03,797 --> 00:17:05,867
Perhaps our paths
will cross again someday.

333
00:17:06,997 --> 00:17:08,350
What is this all about?

334
00:17:08,517 --> 00:17:11,987
I want to market this item as
a new direction in women's fashion.

335
00:17:12,397 --> 00:17:14,467
We're gonna sell this as a top.

336
00:17:14,637 --> 00:17:17,470
Here's the angle. Zelda Fitzgerald...

337
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:18,831
...somebody of the '20s...

338
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:22,831
...wearing this at wild parties,
driving all the men crazy.

339
00:17:23,237 --> 00:17:25,512
Have it on my desk
by the end of the week.

340
00:17:29,997 --> 00:17:31,669
Come in. Come in.

341
00:17:32,557 --> 00:17:33,751
Mr. Steinbrenner.

342
00:17:35,837 --> 00:17:37,065
Is it you?

343
00:17:37,717 --> 00:17:39,867
Yeah, it's me, sir.

344
00:17:40,037 --> 00:17:42,312
It's been a harrowing few days.

345
00:17:42,477 --> 00:17:46,106
After the car accident,
I crawled into a ditch.

346
00:17:46,277 --> 00:17:47,915
I managed to survive...

347
00:17:48,077 --> 00:17:52,628
...on grubs and puddle water until a
kindly old gentleman picked me up.

348
00:17:52,797 --> 00:17:55,516
Grubs, huh? Gotta admit,
I never tasted one of those.

349
00:17:55,677 --> 00:17:57,315
Anyway, as I was lying
in the puddle...

350
00:17:57,477 --> 00:18:00,389
...I think I may have found a way
for us to get Bonds and Griffey...

351
00:18:00,557 --> 00:18:02,149
...and we wouldn't
give up that much.

352
00:18:02,317 --> 00:18:05,593
Don't tell it to me. Tell it to the
new assistant to the general manager.

353
00:18:05,757 --> 00:18:07,156
I didn't get the job?

354
00:18:07,317 --> 00:18:10,434
You were dead. We couldn't sit on
our hands. We had to make a move.

355
00:18:10,637 --> 00:18:12,355
But you still have your old job.

356
00:18:12,517 --> 00:18:14,633
Of course we'll have to
dock the time you missed.

357
00:18:14,797 --> 00:18:16,071
We're running a ball club.

358
00:18:16,237 --> 00:18:19,673
If I give special treatment to you,
everyone will want it. Next, it's chaos.

359
00:18:19,837 --> 00:18:23,034
And I can tell you this: Chaos does
not work for the New York Yankees.

360
00:18:23,197 --> 00:18:25,233
Not as long
as I'm running the show!

361
00:18:26,717 --> 00:18:29,675
So it was the meeting on the street
that prompted you to buy the bra.

362
00:18:29,837 --> 00:18:32,556
- Would you say that was correct?
- Yes.

363
00:18:32,717 --> 00:18:34,389
Yes. That's correct.

364
00:18:37,637 --> 00:18:40,026
And you have also brought with you
another bra...

365
00:18:40,997 --> 00:18:45,275
... exactly like the one that she
so flagrantly exhibited herself in?

366
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:47,350
Yes, that's correct.

367
00:18:47,517 --> 00:18:49,747
What was your golf score
the last round you played...

368
00:18:49,917 --> 00:18:52,477
...before your shoulder was injured?
- Three under par.

369
00:18:53,637 --> 00:18:55,514
Three under par.

370
00:18:56,797 --> 00:18:58,867
That's what the professionals shoot,
isn't it?

371
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:00,675
Well, if they're lucky.

372
00:19:04,517 --> 00:19:05,745
Would you tell this jury...

373
00:19:05,917 --> 00:19:09,227
... exactly what you saw at the corner
of 83rd Street and Columbus?

374
00:19:12,637 --> 00:19:14,707
I don't remember.

375
00:19:17,117 --> 00:19:19,756
Did you or did you not see
the defendant wearing the bra?

376
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:21,476
I don't know. Maybe.

377
00:19:21,637 --> 00:19:24,071
Mr. Seinfeld, I might remind you
that you are under oath.

378
00:19:24,237 --> 00:19:25,670
Now, I ask you again.

379
00:19:25,837 --> 00:19:28,635
Did you or did you not
see this woman wearing a bra?

380
00:19:32,477 --> 00:19:34,866
All right, I saw her. I saw her.

381
00:19:36,157 --> 00:19:39,945
And she was beautiful in that bra.
I'm crazy about her.

382
00:19:40,117 --> 00:19:43,154
I love her whole free- swinging,
freewheeling attitude.

383
00:19:43,317 --> 00:19:44,636
This court will come to order.

384
00:19:44,797 --> 00:19:48,073
- No further questions, Your Honour.
- You may step down.

385
00:19:48,237 --> 00:19:50,228
Well, Kramer,
I think we got this wrapped up.

386
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,955
Yeah, yeah.

387
00:19:52,117 --> 00:19:53,914
What's your read, Stan?

388
00:19:54,077 --> 00:19:56,637
You're close. You're on the green.

389
00:19:56,797 --> 00:19:59,516
You just have to go for the cup.

390
00:19:59,677 --> 00:20:02,066
- What do you mean?
- Have her try on the bra.

391
00:20:02,237 --> 00:20:04,546
- See if it fits.
- No, no, no, no.

392
00:20:04,717 --> 00:20:07,151
Do it, Jackie. Stan's the man.

393
00:20:07,317 --> 00:20:09,990
- Stan? Who the hell is Stan?
- He's my caddy.

394
00:20:10,157 --> 00:20:12,830
Your caddy? This is a big mistake.

395
00:20:14,677 --> 00:20:16,235
Your Honour...

396
00:20:16,397 --> 00:20:20,515
...we request at this time
that Miss Mischke try on the bra.

397
00:20:22,437 --> 00:20:24,632
This court will come to order.

398
00:20:24,797 --> 00:20:26,867
Go ahead, Miss Mischke, try it on.

399
00:20:42,037 --> 00:20:45,313
It doesn't fit. I can't put it on.

400
00:20:45,917 --> 00:20:49,512
You damn fools! Look at that.
We got nothing now. Nothing.

401
00:20:49,677 --> 00:20:52,510
I've been practicing law for 25 years,
you're listening to a caddy.

402
00:20:52,677 --> 00:20:54,156
This is a public humiliation.

403
00:20:54,317 --> 00:20:56,956
You can't let the defendant
control the key piece of evidence.

404
00:20:57,117 --> 00:21:00,553
Plus, she's trying it on over a leotard.
Of course it won't fit over a leotard.

405
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:05,074
A bra's gotta fit right up against
a person's skin. Like a glove!

406
00:21:14,237 --> 00:21:16,797
Hey, Elaine. How about some lunch?

407
00:21:17,837 --> 00:21:19,668
No, I don't think so.

408
00:21:19,837 --> 00:21:23,034
Great job on the Gatsby Swing Top.
It's a winner.

409
00:21:23,197 --> 00:21:24,755
Yeah. Yeah, thanks.

410
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:26,987
Sure you don't wanna go?
We have reservations.

411
00:21:27,157 --> 00:21:29,591
Oh, I don't think you'll have
any trouble getting a table.

412
00:21:30,397 --> 00:21:32,627
- Ciao.
- Bye- bye.
