1
00:00:02,497 --> 00:00:04,010
<i>You get to a point
with your parents...</i>

2
00:00:05,617 --> 00:00:08,609
<i>...where all you can do with them
is eat. You can't talk anymore...</i>

3
00:00:08,777 --> 00:00:11,974
<i>...but you wanna at least try
and keep your mouths moving.</i>

4
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:14,446
<i>And they're so anxious for it,
you know. You come in:</i>

5
00:00:14,617 --> 00:00:16,448
<i>"How was the plane?
You must be hungry.</i>

6
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:18,289
<i>How did you sleep?
Ready for breakfast?"</i>

7
00:00:18,497 --> 00:00:21,091
<i>My mother will argue with me
about what I like.</i>

8
00:00:21,257 --> 00:00:24,294
<i>"Can I have a piece of pumpkin pie?"
"You don't like pumpkin pie."</i>

9
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:26,687
<i>"Yes, I do."
"Since when?"</i>

10
00:00:26,857 --> 00:00:28,449
<i>"What's the difference?
Can I have it?"</i>

11
00:00:28,617 --> 00:00:32,053
<i>"No. I have never seen you eat
a piece of pumpkin pie."</i>

12
00:00:36,297 --> 00:00:38,333
<i>Mr. Peterman sent me over here
for a physical...</i>

13
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:40,613
<i>...because as you may
or may not know...</i>

14
00:00:40,817 --> 00:00:43,889
<i>...he and I are going on a trip
to Kenya.</i>

15
00:00:44,777 --> 00:00:46,449
Africa.

16
00:00:47,017 --> 00:00:49,690
<i>It's my first such mission
for the company.</i>

17
00:00:50,377 --> 00:00:52,937
<i>The Masai Bushmen
wear these great sandals...</i>

18
00:00:53,097 --> 00:00:55,565
<i>...and we're gonna knock them off.</i>

19
00:00:55,937 --> 00:00:58,405
<i>Not the Masai, the sandals.</i>

20
00:00:58,777 --> 00:01:01,769
<i>- I'll need a urine sample.
- Right.</i>

21
00:01:03,177 --> 00:01:05,566
<i>Africa? Do you know how hot
it gets there?</i>

22
00:01:05,777 --> 00:01:08,052
<i>Like 150 degrees.</i>

23
00:01:08,217 --> 00:01:10,811
<i>Your skin is gonna be
simmering with boils.</i>

24
00:01:11,017 --> 00:01:13,053
<i>Oh, come on.</i>

25
00:01:13,217 --> 00:01:14,696
<i>You coming to The Tonight Show?</i>

26
00:01:14,857 --> 00:01:17,007
<i>Yeah, yeah. My parents wanna
come too, is that okay?</i>

27
00:01:17,217 --> 00:01:19,572
<i>- Sure. My parents will be there.
- The Tonight Show?</i>

28
00:01:19,737 --> 00:01:21,250
<i>Yeah, they're in town.
You wanna go?</i>

29
00:01:21,457 --> 00:01:23,288
<i>- Are you doing new material?
- No.</i>

30
00:01:23,457 --> 00:01:24,731
I don't think so.

31
00:01:27,417 --> 00:01:30,090
<i>Hey, the super's in my bathroom
changing my showerhead.</i>

32
00:01:30,297 --> 00:01:32,765
<i>- Have they changed yours?
- No, he's doing mine next.</i>

33
00:01:32,937 --> 00:01:36,213
<i>- They're low-flow, you know.
- Low-flow?</i>

34
00:01:36,377 --> 00:01:38,732
<i>Well, I don't like the sound of that.</i>

35
00:01:40,457 --> 00:01:42,607
<i>So, what are your parents
doing here in New York?</i>

36
00:01:42,817 --> 00:01:44,091
<i>Well, they were humiliated.</i>

37
00:01:44,257 --> 00:01:46,771
<i>After the impeachment,
my father left office in disgrace.</i>

38
00:01:47,537 --> 00:01:50,051
<i>- So, what are their plans?
- Well, this is the problem.</i>

39
00:01:50,217 --> 00:01:53,095
<i>They're moving into this new
development. Here's the pamphlet.</i>

40
00:01:53,297 --> 00:01:55,857
<i>"Del Boca Vista."But they're
not quite ready to go back...</i>

41
00:01:56,017 --> 00:01:58,850
<i>...so they're in seclusion here
for a while at Uncle Leo's.</i>

42
00:01:59,057 --> 00:02:00,649
<i>The three of them
in that tiny apartment?</i>

43
00:02:00,857 --> 00:02:03,417
<i>No, Leo's not there.
He's got a girlfriend, Lydia.</i>

44
00:02:03,577 --> 00:02:07,365
<i>- In fact, he moved in with her.
- Uncle Leo's having regular sex?</i>

45
00:02:07,577 --> 00:02:10,091
<i>Yeah, I know, it devalues
the whole thing.</i>

46
00:02:14,057 --> 00:02:15,649
<i>- Hello.
- What time do we have to be...</i>

47
00:02:15,817 --> 00:02:17,296
<i>...at The Tonight Show on Thursday?</i>

48
00:02:17,657 --> 00:02:21,332
<i>- You gotta be there at 4:30.
- But it comes on at 11:30.</i>

49
00:02:21,537 --> 00:02:24,813
<i>Yeah, well, they tape it in the
afternoon and then they air it at 11:30.</i>

50
00:02:25,017 --> 00:02:28,168
<i>- How long they been doing this?
- Thirty years.</i>

51
00:02:28,377 --> 00:02:31,414
<i>Helen, did you know that they
tape this thing in the afternoon?</i>

52
00:02:31,617 --> 00:02:33,608
<i>All right. I'll see you later.</i>

53
00:02:33,817 --> 00:02:36,012
<i>Georgie, how come your parents
never moved to Florida?</i>

54
00:02:38,737 --> 00:02:40,329
<i>Yeah, that is odd, isn't it?</i>

55
00:02:40,537 --> 00:02:42,528
<i>- Yeah, it is.
- I mean, they're retired.</i>

56
00:02:42,697 --> 00:02:44,653
<i>There's no economic reason
for them to be here.</i>

57
00:02:45,057 --> 00:02:46,536
<i>They have no friends.</i>

58
00:02:46,697 --> 00:02:48,415
<i>No social reason for them
to be here.</i>

59
00:02:48,617 --> 00:02:51,848
<i>- You're all grown-up.
- Yeah, they're through ruining my life.</i>

60
00:02:52,017 --> 00:02:54,133
<i>What the hell
are they still doing here?</i>

61
00:02:54,337 --> 00:02:56,248
<i>Let me see this pamphlet.</i>

62
00:02:58,737 --> 00:03:00,455
<i>All right, I'll...</i>

63
00:03:00,617 --> 00:03:02,414
<i>I'll get back to you.</i>

64
00:03:06,817 --> 00:03:08,375
<i>- Hello?
- Where can I buy some ice?</i>

65
00:03:08,537 --> 00:03:10,209
<i>Your father likes a lot of ice.</i>

66
00:03:11,177 --> 00:03:13,372
<i>I don't know.
Maybe get an ice tray?</i>

67
00:03:13,577 --> 00:03:16,137
<i>- I can do that.
- You know, Dad just called me.</i>

68
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:18,413
<i>Yeah, I know.
His phlebitis is acting up.</i>

69
00:03:18,617 --> 00:03:20,733
<i>Yeah. All right.
Well, I got some people here.</i>

70
00:03:20,937 --> 00:03:22,370
<i>- Okay.
- All right, bye.</i>

71
00:03:22,537 --> 00:03:23,811
<i>- You see this?
- What?</i>

72
00:03:23,977 --> 00:03:26,013
<i>Any thought pops into their head,
they call me...</i>

73
00:03:26,177 --> 00:03:28,088
<i>...because it's a local call now.</i>

74
00:03:28,297 --> 00:03:31,255
<i>I'm used to a 1200-mile buffer zone.</i>

75
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:34,534
<i>I can't handle this. Plus, I got
the dinners, I got the pop-ins.</i>

76
00:03:34,697 --> 00:03:38,212
<i>- They pop in. It's brutal.
- Any idea when they're going back?</i>

77
00:03:38,377 --> 00:03:40,891
<i>The only way out is if
Leo breaks up with his girlfriend...</i>

78
00:03:41,057 --> 00:03:43,969
<i>...and moves back in. Then they
would have to go back to Florida.</i>

79
00:03:44,417 --> 00:03:45,406
<i>How's that gonna happen?</i>

80
00:03:46,737 --> 00:03:49,809
<i>It's about time you called your uncle.
We gotta do this once a week.</i>

81
00:03:51,137 --> 00:03:53,093
<i>Once a week?</i>

82
00:03:53,537 --> 00:03:54,856
So how's Lydia?

83
00:03:55,017 --> 00:03:56,735
<i>She's a real tiger.</i>

84
00:03:57,177 --> 00:03:58,576
I don't know how you do it.

85
00:03:58,897 --> 00:04:01,365
<i>- What?
- Well, a man like you...</i>

86
00:04:01,537 --> 00:04:05,325
<i>...limiting yourself to one woman.
I don't know. It's none of my business.</i>

87
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:07,493
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

88
00:04:07,817 --> 00:04:10,490
<i>- Well-
- Look at this.</i>

89
00:04:10,657 --> 00:04:13,217
<i>I told them medium rare.
It's medium.</i>

90
00:04:13,417 --> 00:04:16,614
<i>- It happens.
- I bet that cook is an anti-Semite.</i>

91
00:04:16,817 --> 00:04:18,296
<i>He has no idea who you are.</i>

92
00:04:18,457 --> 00:04:21,972
<i>They don't just overcook
a hamburger, Jerry.</i>

93
00:04:22,177 --> 00:04:24,088
<i>Fine. Anyway, the point
I was making...</i>

94
00:04:24,257 --> 00:04:27,408
<i>...before Goebbels
made your hamburger here is this:</i>

95
00:04:27,577 --> 00:04:30,853
<i>A man like you could be
dating women 20 years younger.</i>

96
00:04:31,057 --> 00:04:33,776
<i>Come on, Uncle Leo,
I've seen the way women look at you.</i>

97
00:04:33,977 --> 00:04:37,686
<i>When's the last time you looked
in the mirror? You're an Adonis.</i>

98
00:04:37,857 --> 00:04:40,007
<i>You've got beautiful features,
lovely skin.</i>

99
00:04:40,217 --> 00:04:43,653
<i>You're in the prime of your life here.
You should be swinging.</i>

100
00:04:43,857 --> 00:04:46,417
<i>If I were you,
I'd tell this Lydia character:</i>

101
00:04:46,617 --> 00:04:47,891
<i>"It's been real."</i>

102
00:04:48,057 --> 00:04:50,776
<i>Move back into that bachelor pad
and put out a sign:</i>

103
00:04:50,937 --> 00:04:53,451
<i>"Open for business."</i>

104
00:04:53,897 --> 00:04:55,250
<i>Believe me, I thought about it...</i>

105
00:04:55,417 --> 00:04:59,296
<i>...but she is so perfect in every way,
I can't see a flaw.</i>

106
00:04:59,497 --> 00:05:01,453
<i>Well, keep looking.</i>

107
00:05:03,097 --> 00:05:04,894
<i>Oh, hi, Mr. Peterman.</i>

108
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:07,736
<i>Do you realize how short
the Kalahari Bushmen are?</i>

109
00:05:07,937 --> 00:05:10,849
<i>I'm gonna look like a giant
to those guys.</i>

110
00:05:12,337 --> 00:05:14,055
<i>I'm afraid I have
some bad news, Elaine.</i>

111
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:17,132
<i>It appears you will not be
accompanying me to Africa.</i>

112
00:05:17,577 --> 00:05:19,772
What? Why not?

113
00:05:19,977 --> 00:05:22,366
<i>I'm afraid it's your urine, Elaine.</i>

114
00:05:22,537 --> 00:05:25,574
<i>You've tested positive for opium.</i>

115
00:05:25,777 --> 00:05:27,768
<i>- Opium?
- That's right, Elaine.</i>

116
00:05:27,977 --> 00:05:30,013
<i>White Lotus. Yam-yam.</i>

117
00:05:30,177 --> 00:05:32,407
Shanghai Sally.

118
00:05:32,617 --> 00:05:35,609
<i>Well, that's impossible.
I've never done a drug in my life.</i>

119
00:05:35,777 --> 00:05:37,768
<i>Dr. Strugatz must have
made a mistake.</i>

120
00:05:37,977 --> 00:05:39,569
<i>Not a chance.</i>

121
00:05:39,737 --> 00:05:43,013
<i>I'm afraid I'll just have to find someone
else to accompany me on my journey.</i>

122
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:45,850
<i>The Dark Continent
is no place for an addict, Elaine.</i>

123
00:05:46,537 --> 00:05:49,210
<i>Obviously, Mr. Peterman,
there's something wrong with this test.</i>

124
00:05:49,417 --> 00:05:51,294
<i>I don't take opium.</i>

125
00:05:51,457 --> 00:05:54,255
<i>Let me take another one, please?
I'll call the doctor right now.</i>

126
00:05:54,417 --> 00:05:56,328
<i>I'll take a pop urine test.</i>

127
00:05:57,457 --> 00:06:01,416
<i>- All right, Elaine.
- Oh, thank you, Mr. Peterman.</i>

128
00:06:02,777 --> 00:06:04,927
<i>I'll be ready in three minutes.</i>

129
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,414
<i>Boy, it's cold outside, huh?</i>

130
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:12,250
<i>Oh, these New York winters.</i>

131
00:06:12,417 --> 00:06:13,770
<i>Bitter cold. Bitter.</i>

132
00:06:13,977 --> 00:06:16,730
<i>I was out for five minutes before.
I couldn't feel my extremities.</i>

133
00:06:16,937 --> 00:06:19,212
<i>What extremities?</i>

134
00:06:20,057 --> 00:06:23,493
<i>You know what the temperature
in Florida is today?</i>

135
00:06:23,657 --> 00:06:25,295
<i>Seventy-nine.</i>

136
00:06:25,497 --> 00:06:27,215
That's almost 80.

137
00:06:27,857 --> 00:06:30,849
<i>Yeah, I read someplace,
the life expectancy in Florida...</i>

138
00:06:31,017 --> 00:06:35,056
<i>...is 81. And in Queens, 73.</i>

139
00:06:35,257 --> 00:06:37,896
<i>So, George, why are you here?</i>

140
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:42,375
<i>What, I can't stop by
and visit my parents?</i>

141
00:06:42,537 --> 00:06:44,050
What's this?

142
00:06:44,257 --> 00:06:47,215
<i>That's where the Seinfelds
are moving. They got a great deal.</i>

143
00:06:47,377 --> 00:06:49,527
<i>- Yeah?
- You know what they got in Florida?</i>

144
00:06:49,697 --> 00:06:51,050
Jai alai.

145
00:06:51,217 --> 00:06:53,731
<i>You bet on the games,
you clean up.</i>

146
00:06:53,937 --> 00:06:56,451
<i>- I don't bet.
- Well, what about the dolphins?</i>

147
00:06:56,617 --> 00:06:58,096
<i>You can swim
with the dolphins there.</i>

148
00:06:58,297 --> 00:07:00,367
I don't swim.

149
00:07:00,777 --> 00:07:02,335
<i>Well, you could pet them.</i>

150
00:07:02,497 --> 00:07:04,692
<i>They come right out of the water
onto the sidewalks.</i>

151
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,889
<i>Are you trying to get rid of us?</i>

152
00:07:12,377 --> 00:07:13,856
<i>I care about your comfort.</i>

153
00:07:14,057 --> 00:07:15,490
<i>Be it here in Queens...</i>

154
00:07:15,657 --> 00:07:18,296
<i>...or 1200 miles away.</i>

155
00:07:23,217 --> 00:07:24,650
No?

156
00:07:28,257 --> 00:07:30,487
<i>Jerry. Jerry!</i>

157
00:07:33,417 --> 00:07:35,533
<i>- You too, huh?
- Yeah.</i>

158
00:07:36,817 --> 00:07:39,126
<i>These showers are horrible.
There's no pressure.</i>

159
00:07:39,297 --> 00:07:41,891
<i>- I can't get the shampoo out.
- Me either.</i>

160
00:07:42,097 --> 00:07:45,726
<i>If I don't have a good shower, I am not
myself. I feel weak and ineffectual.</i>

161
00:07:45,897 --> 00:07:47,728
<i>- I'm not Kramer.
- You? What about me?</i>

162
00:07:47,897 --> 00:07:49,216
<i>I got The Tonight Show tonight.</i>

163
00:07:49,377 --> 00:07:51,686
<i>I'm gonna have to shower
in the dressing room.</i>

164
00:07:52,297 --> 00:07:55,414
<i>- Where you going?
- Well, I gotta find another shower.</i>

165
00:08:01,137 --> 00:08:03,332
<i>- They got you too?
- This is awful.</i>

166
00:08:03,497 --> 00:08:05,055
<i>I'm not Newman.</i>

167
00:08:08,057 --> 00:08:12,209
<i>"Rid"? Ma, come on.
The word is "care.""Care."</i>

168
00:08:11,377 --> 00:08:13,891
<i>- Oh, Elaine. Yeah.
- Kramer, you look terrible.</i>

169
00:08:14,057 --> 00:08:17,015
<i>Yeah. I need the keys to your
apartment. I gotta take a shower.</i>

170
00:08:17,217 --> 00:08:20,254
<i>- What's wrong with your shower?
- There's no water pressure.</i>

171
00:08:20,457 --> 00:08:22,652
<i>- Why didn't you go see Jerry?
- Jerry's got nothing.</i>

172
00:08:22,817 --> 00:08:25,695
<i>Newman's got nothing. You're
the one who's got the good stuff.</i>

173
00:08:25,897 --> 00:08:29,333
<i>And I need it bad, baby, because I feel
like I got bugs crawling up my skin.</i>

174
00:08:29,537 --> 00:08:32,415
<i>- Now, you gotta help me out.
- Not on my watch!</i>

175
00:08:32,617 --> 00:08:35,051
<i>I won't have you turning my office
into a den of iniquity!</i>

176
00:08:35,217 --> 00:08:37,492
<i>- What's wrong with you?
- Get your fix somewhere else!</i>

177
00:08:37,897 --> 00:08:39,967
<i>Go on, beat it!</i>

178
00:08:43,017 --> 00:08:47,568
<i>- Mr. Peterman, what are you doing?
- Elaine, you're out of control.</i>

179
00:08:47,737 --> 00:08:49,136
<i>You need help.</i>

180
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,853
<i>I know what you're going through.</i>

181
00:08:52,017 --> 00:08:54,815
<i>I, too, once fell under the spell
of opium.</i>

182
00:08:55,017 --> 00:08:57,451
<i>It was 1979.
I was traveling the Yangtze...</i>

183
00:08:57,617 --> 00:08:59,369
<i>...in search
of a Mongolian horsehair vest.</i>

184
00:08:59,577 --> 00:09:01,056
<i>Oh, for God's sake.</i>

185
00:09:01,257 --> 00:09:04,613
<i>I had got to the market after sundown.
All of the clothing traders had gone.</i>

186
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:06,733
<i>But a different sort of trader
still lurked.</i>

187
00:09:10,297 --> 00:09:14,006
<i>Mr. Peterman, I don't know
what's going on here.</i>

188
00:09:14,177 --> 00:09:17,374
<i>I am not addicted to anything.</i>

189
00:09:17,577 --> 00:09:19,807
<i>Oh, Elaine.</i>

190
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:23,731
<i>The toll road of denial
is a long and dangerous one.</i>

191
00:09:23,937 --> 00:09:26,531
<i>The price? Your soul.</i>

192
00:09:28,457 --> 00:09:31,767
<i>Oh, and by the way, you have
till 5:00 to clear out your desk.</i>

193
00:09:31,937 --> 00:09:33,370
<i>You're fired.</i>

194
00:09:37,257 --> 00:09:40,215
<i>- All they serve is chicken?
- There's more food down the hall.</i>

195
00:09:40,417 --> 00:09:42,567
<i>Here, wrap it up. We'll take it home.</i>

196
00:09:44,457 --> 00:09:46,368
<i>- Oh, hey.
- Oh, hi.</i>

197
00:09:46,537 --> 00:09:47,731
<i>Hello, Seinfelds.</i>

198
00:09:47,897 --> 00:09:49,774
<i>- Hello.
- Hi, Estelle.</i>

199
00:09:49,977 --> 00:09:52,537
<i>This is your dressing room?
They treat you like Toscanini.</i>

200
00:09:53,297 --> 00:09:56,289
<i>Oh, Jerry, I don't know
how you can do this.</i>

201
00:09:56,457 --> 00:09:58,288
<i>I'm so nervous for you.</i>

202
00:09:58,497 --> 00:09:59,850
Actually, I'm drunk.

203
00:10:01,177 --> 00:10:03,327
<i>Hey. Hey, how is Florida, huh?</i>

204
00:10:03,537 --> 00:10:05,289
<i>We just bought a new place
down there.</i>

205
00:10:05,497 --> 00:10:07,567
<i>I know. We were looking
at the brochure.</i>

206
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:10,094
<i>"Just a taste,"he said.
That was all it took.</i>

207
00:10:07,777 --> 00:10:09,449
- You what?
- Why, you thinking of moving?

208
00:10:09,657 --> 00:10:11,693
<i>- Not really.
- Because if you are, you shouldn't.</i>

209
00:10:11,857 --> 00:10:13,449
<i>There's nothing available there.</i>

210
00:10:13,657 --> 00:10:17,536
<i>Are you telling me there's not one
condo available in Del Boca Vista?</i>

211
00:10:17,737 --> 00:10:20,535
<i>That's right.
They went like hotcakes.</i>

212
00:10:20,697 --> 00:10:22,369
<i>- How'd you get yours?
- Got lucky.</i>

213
00:10:22,857 --> 00:10:25,610
<i>Are you trying to keep us out
of Del Boca Vista?</i>

214
00:10:25,817 --> 00:10:27,648
<i>I know this doesn't seem
like work to you...</i>

215
00:10:27,817 --> 00:10:30,854
<i>...but if you'd conduct the psychopath
convention down the hall...</i>

216
00:10:31,057 --> 00:10:34,254
<i>...so I could just get
a little personal space.</i>

217
00:10:36,297 --> 00:10:38,652
<i>How could I have
tested positive twice?</i>

218
00:10:38,857 --> 00:10:41,655
<i>Once, I can understand.
That's a mistake. But twice?</i>

219
00:10:41,857 --> 00:10:43,449
<i>Yeah, it's hard to figure.</i>

220
00:10:43,617 --> 00:10:46,290
<i>I mean, I've lost my job.
I can't go to Africa.</i>

221
00:10:46,497 --> 00:10:48,727
<i>I was gonna meet
the Bushmen of the Kalahari.</i>

222
00:10:48,937 --> 00:10:50,893
<i>- The Bushmen?
- And the Bushwomen.</i>

223
00:10:51,097 --> 00:10:53,292
<i>Excuse me.
I couldn't help overhearing.</i>

224
00:10:53,497 --> 00:10:55,533
<i>I notice you're eating
a poppy seed muffin there.</i>

225
00:10:55,737 --> 00:10:57,329
<i>Yeah, I eat these muffins
all the time.</i>

226
00:10:57,537 --> 00:10:59,414
<i>Well, you know what opium
is made from.</i>

227
00:11:01,897 --> 00:11:03,410
<i>Poppies!</i>

228
00:11:06,377 --> 00:11:08,288
<i>Welcome back.
Talking with Jerry Seinfeld.</i>

229
00:11:08,457 --> 00:11:10,766
<i>Jerry, let me ask you,
I saw some people back there...</i>

230
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:14,009
<i>- ... they look lik e family. Is that family?
- I got some family backstage.</i>

231
00:11:14,177 --> 00:11:15,530
<i>My family's nuts. They're crazy.</i>

232
00:11:15,697 --> 00:11:17,608
<i>- Yeah?
- Yeah.</i>

233
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,813
<i>My Uncle Leo,
I had lunch with him the other day.</i>

234
00:11:19,977 --> 00:11:22,047
<i>He's one of these guys
that anything goes wrong...</i>

235
00:11:22,217 --> 00:11:23,491
<i>...he blames anti-Semitism.</i>

236
00:11:23,697 --> 00:11:26,734
<i>Know what I mean? The spaghetti's
not al dente? Cook, anti-Semite.</i>

237
00:11:26,897 --> 00:11:28,774
<i>- Right there, yeah.
- Loses a bet on a horse?</i>

238
00:11:28,937 --> 00:11:32,486
<i>- Secretariat, anti-Semitic.
- Even the horse- Even the animal.</i>

239
00:11:32,657 --> 00:11:34,966
<i>The High Holy Days in the temple?
Rabbi, anti-Semite.</i>

240
00:11:42,257 --> 00:11:45,727
<i>Listen to this. My Uncle Leo broke up
with his girlfriend because of my bit.</i>

241
00:11:45,897 --> 00:11:48,775
<i>She thought it was funny, so he
accused her of being an anti-Semite.</i>

242
00:11:48,937 --> 00:11:51,326
<i>They had a fight, now he's
moving back to his apartment.</i>

243
00:11:51,497 --> 00:11:53,965
<i>Know what this means? My parents
are gonna go back to Florida.</i>

244
00:11:54,137 --> 00:11:55,490
What?

245
00:11:55,657 --> 00:11:57,488
<i>What number is this?</i>

246
00:11:58,537 --> 00:12:00,607
<i>Oh, I'm terribly sorry.</i>

247
00:12:02,457 --> 00:12:05,733
<i>Kramer, my parents are gonna have to
move back to Florida. Isn't that great?</i>

248
00:12:06,057 --> 00:12:07,695
<i>Yeah, well, I'm really happy for you.</i>

249
00:12:08,617 --> 00:12:11,927
<i>Hey, you're not giving it to me, man.
What's wrong?</i>

250
00:12:12,257 --> 00:12:15,010
<i>I just took a bath, Jerry. A bath.</i>

251
00:12:15,377 --> 00:12:18,130
- No good?
- It's disgusting.

252
00:12:18,297 --> 00:12:22,051
<i>I'm sitting there in a tepid pool
of my own filth.</i>

253
00:12:22,217 --> 00:12:26,733
<i>All kinds of microscopic parasites
and organisms...</i>

254
00:12:26,897 --> 00:12:29,127
<i>...having sex all around me.</i>

255
00:12:30,137 --> 00:12:32,014
<i>Well, you used to sit
in that hot tub.</i>

256
00:12:32,217 --> 00:12:36,005
<i>Jerry, that was super-heated water.
Nothing could live in that.</i>

257
00:12:36,217 --> 00:12:38,651
<i>- Chicken?
- Oh, yeah.</i>

258
00:12:39,457 --> 00:12:41,175
<i>Well, this you're not gonna believe.</i>

259
00:12:41,377 --> 00:12:44,016
<i>I found out why
I was testing positive for opium.</i>

260
00:12:44,177 --> 00:12:46,486
<i>- Poppy seeds.
- Poppy seeds.</i>

261
00:12:46,697 --> 00:12:48,528
<i>- Yep, that makes sense.
- Yeah.</i>

262
00:12:48,697 --> 00:12:50,528
<i>- Here you want some chicken?
- Yeah, thanks.</i>

263
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:53,456
<i>So I'm gonna get tested again later.</i>

264
00:12:53,617 --> 00:12:58,008
<i>Hopefully I'll get my job back,
and I will be on my way to Africa.</i>

265
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,813
<i>Hello, Newman.</i>

266
00:13:03,217 --> 00:13:08,735
<i>Hello, Jerry. Well, I may have
a solution to our little problem.</i>

267
00:13:10,537 --> 00:13:12,607
<i>- Elaine, will you excuse us?
- Oh, come on, Newman.</i>

268
00:13:12,817 --> 00:13:15,251
<i>I have a private matter to discuss
with my fellow tenants.</i>

269
00:13:15,417 --> 00:13:16,896
<i>If you don't mind...</i>

270
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:18,849
<i>- Jerry-
- Look, sister, go get yourself...</i>

271
00:13:19,017 --> 00:13:21,008
<i>...a cup of coffee, all right? Beat it.</i>

272
00:13:23,097 --> 00:13:25,930
<i>All right. Now, here's the lowdown.
Through a certain connection...</i>

273
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:28,657
<i>...I've been able to locate
some black-market showerheads.</i>

274
00:13:28,857 --> 00:13:30,973
<i>They're all made
in the former Yugoslavia.</i>

275
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:34,169
<i>And from what I hear, the Serbs
are fanatic about their showers.</i>

276
00:13:34,377 --> 00:13:36,572
<i>Not from the footage I've seen.</i>

277
00:13:40,137 --> 00:13:42,856
<i>Nevertheless,
sometime this afternoon...</i>

278
00:13:43,017 --> 00:13:46,089
<i>...behind the market diner,
an unmarked van will be waiting.</i>

279
00:13:46,257 --> 00:13:48,817
<i>I'm expecting the call at any time.</i>

280
00:13:48,977 --> 00:13:51,252
<i>- Are you in?
- I'm down.</i>

281
00:13:51,417 --> 00:13:52,930
<i>Jerry?</i>

282
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:02,369
<i>So, Georgie,
we have some big news for you.</i>

283
00:14:02,537 --> 00:14:05,370
<i>- Big news?
- We're moving to Florida.</i>

284
00:14:05,937 --> 00:14:07,450
What?

285
00:14:07,657 --> 00:14:10,046
<i>You're moving to Florida?</i>

286
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:13,607
<i>That's wonderful. I'm so happy!</i>

287
00:14:13,777 --> 00:14:16,132
For you! I'm so happy for you!

288
00:14:16,297 --> 00:14:18,686
<i>Oh, what do you need
this cold weather for?</i>

289
00:14:18,897 --> 00:14:20,171
<i>Has nothing to do with weather.</i>

290
00:14:20,337 --> 00:14:22,373
<i>- It's because of the Seinfelds.
- What do you mean?</i>

291
00:14:22,577 --> 00:14:25,091
<i>They don't want us there,
so we're going.</i>

292
00:14:26,057 --> 00:14:29,493
<i>We're moving right into
Del Boca Vista!</i>

293
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,767
<i>- So you're moving there for spite.
- Absolutely.</i>

294
00:14:34,097 --> 00:14:36,736
<i>No one tells Frank Costanza
what to do!</i>

295
00:14:36,937 --> 00:14:40,327
<i>That's right! Who the hell are they?
How dare they?</i>

296
00:14:42,697 --> 00:14:45,416
<i>So, Georgie, are you gonna
come to visit us?</i>

297
00:14:45,577 --> 00:14:49,570
<i>Oh, every chance I get.</i>

298
00:14:51,617 --> 00:14:54,256
<i>Jerry, Jerry!
I'm busting, I'm busting!</i>

299
00:14:54,457 --> 00:14:57,096
<i>- Well, what's going on?
- My parents are moving to Florida!</i>

300
00:14:57,297 --> 00:14:59,811
<i>- Are you kidding?
- Can you believe it? It's happening!</i>

301
00:14:59,977 --> 00:15:02,366
<i>It's finally happening, I'm free!</i>

302
00:15:02,577 --> 00:15:05,250
<i>- Well, where are they moving to?
- Del Boca Vista.</i>

303
00:15:05,457 --> 00:15:07,095
<i>That's where my parents
are gonna live.</i>

304
00:15:07,297 --> 00:15:08,889
<i>- I know.
- We can visit together.</i>

305
00:15:09,097 --> 00:15:10,371
<i>Every five years!</i>

306
00:15:12,617 --> 00:15:15,529
<i>- That's incredible.
- You know why they're moving there?</i>

307
00:15:15,697 --> 00:15:17,415
<i>- Why?
- To spite your parents.</i>

308
00:15:17,577 --> 00:15:18,851
<i>- To spite my parents?
- Yeah.</i>

309
00:15:19,017 --> 00:15:21,577
<i>- Your parents are crazy.
- I know, they're out of their mind.</i>

310
00:15:21,777 --> 00:15:23,130
<i>- I don't believe it.
- Fantastic.</i>

311
00:15:23,337 --> 00:15:25,453
<i>- My parents are moving back too.
- Beautiful!</i>

312
00:15:27,617 --> 00:15:31,371
<i>I'm sorry Leo's moving back here.
I'm not ready to go back to Florida.</i>

313
00:15:31,577 --> 00:15:35,570
<i>He was getting along so well
with that woman. What happened?</i>

314
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,211
<i>Hello?</i>

315
00:15:39,377 --> 00:15:42,847
<i>- This is Frank Costanza.
- What do you want?</i>

316
00:15:43,017 --> 00:15:45,736
<i>You think you can k eep us
out of Florida?</i>

317
00:15:45,937 --> 00:15:49,293
<i>We're moving in
lock, stock and barrel.</i>

318
00:15:49,457 --> 00:15:51,175
<i>We're gonna be in the pool.</i>

319
00:15:51,337 --> 00:15:53,168
<i>We're gonna be in the clubhouse.</i>

320
00:15:53,337 --> 00:15:56,056
<i>We're gonna be all over
that shuffleboard court...</i>

321
00:15:56,217 --> 00:15:59,766
<i>...and I dare you to keep me out!</i>

322
00:16:01,697 --> 00:16:03,892
<i>I'm sorry, we can't go back
to Florida.</i>

323
00:16:10,817 --> 00:16:12,694
<i>I can't believe
I didn't push for this sooner.</i>

324
00:16:12,897 --> 00:16:15,809
<i>You have no idea how your life
is gonna improve as a result of this.</i>

325
00:16:15,977 --> 00:16:17,535
<i>Food tastes better.</i>

326
00:16:17,697 --> 00:16:19,733
<i>The air seems fresher.
You'll have more energy...</i>

327
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:22,616
<i>...and self-confidence
than you ever dreamed of.</i>

328
00:16:24,297 --> 00:16:26,174
<i>- Hello.
- Hello, Jerry, it's your father.</i>

329
00:16:26,377 --> 00:16:27,730
- Oh, hi, Dad.
- Is it all right...

330
00:16:27,897 --> 00:16:30,536
<i>...if we move in with you
for a little while?</i>

331
00:16:31,417 --> 00:16:34,807
<i>- What was that?
- Nothing. A bottle broke, that's all.</i>

332
00:16:34,977 --> 00:16:36,933
<i>What do you mean,
you're gonna move in here?</i>

333
00:16:37,137 --> 00:16:39,605
<i>Because the Costanzas
are moving in to Del Boca Vista.</i>

334
00:16:39,817 --> 00:16:42,377
<i>- But it's a big complex.
- You don't understand.</i>

335
00:16:42,577 --> 00:16:44,772
<i>You gotta have a buffer zone.</i>

336
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:48,448
<i>All right, fine. Come over here.</i>

337
00:16:49,177 --> 00:16:50,610
What?

338
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:53,337
<i>They're not going back to Florida.</i>

339
00:16:53,497 --> 00:16:55,613
<i>- They're moving here.
- What? Why?</i>

340
00:16:55,817 --> 00:16:58,047
<i>Because your parents
are going down there.</i>

341
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:01,607
<i>My buffer zone just went from
1200 miles down to two feet.</i>

342
00:17:01,777 --> 00:17:02,766
<i>You gotta do something.</i>

343
00:17:03,497 --> 00:17:05,886
<i>Hey, I'm sorry. You had
your buffer zone for many years.</i>

344
00:17:06,057 --> 00:17:08,446
<i>It's my time to live, baby.</i>

345
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:13,769
<i>You know what you're doing,
don't you?</i>

346
00:17:13,937 --> 00:17:15,495
<i>You're killing independent Jerry.</i>

347
00:17:17,057 --> 00:17:19,446
<i>I gotta go see my Uncle Leo.</i>

348
00:17:19,617 --> 00:17:22,256
<i>I think he may have made
a big mistake.</i>

349
00:17:23,017 --> 00:17:24,894
<i>- Move back with Lydia?
- Come on.</i>

350
00:17:25,057 --> 00:17:26,649
<i>You're lucky to have anybody.</i>

351
00:17:27,617 --> 00:17:30,768
<i>Last week you told me I was
in my prime. I should be swinging.</i>

352
00:17:30,977 --> 00:17:33,445
<i>Swinging?
What, are you out of your mind?</i>

353
00:17:33,617 --> 00:17:35,335
<i>Look at you. You're disgusting.</i>

354
00:17:36,377 --> 00:17:37,651
<i>You're bald. You're paunchy.</i>

355
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:41,054
<i>All kinds of sounds are emanating
from your body 24 hours a day.</i>

356
00:17:41,297 --> 00:17:44,972
<i>If there's a woman that can take your
presence for more than 10 seconds...</i>

357
00:17:45,137 --> 00:17:47,207
<i>...you should hang on to her
like grim death.</i>

358
00:17:47,377 --> 00:17:49,686
<i>Which is not far off, by the way.</i>

359
00:17:49,897 --> 00:17:53,446
<i>- But she's an anti-Semite.
- Can you blame her?</i>

360
00:17:54,617 --> 00:17:56,812
<i>You don't think he minds
us staying here, do you?</i>

361
00:17:57,017 --> 00:17:59,770
<i>Why would he mind?
We're his parents.</i>

362
00:18:02,417 --> 00:18:03,975
<i>- Hi, Elaine.
- Hello.</i>

363
00:18:04,457 --> 00:18:07,096
<i>- Jerry's not here?
- No.</i>

364
00:18:08,297 --> 00:18:11,494
- Oh, my God.
- What?

365
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:13,773
<i>A poppy seed.</i>

366
00:18:13,937 --> 00:18:16,087
<i>It must have been in the chicken.</i>

367
00:18:16,257 --> 00:18:18,009
<i>Oh, I'm dead.</i>

368
00:18:18,177 --> 00:18:20,133
<i>I'm going to the doctor's
in a half an hour.</i>

369
00:18:20,337 --> 00:18:22,612
- Why?
- It's a long story.

370
00:18:22,817 --> 00:18:24,887
<i>Just a second.
I have to go to the bathroom.</i>

371
00:18:26,737 --> 00:18:28,887
<i>Wait. What are you gonna do
in there?</i>

372
00:18:29,057 --> 00:18:30,536
<i>What am I gonna do
in the bathroom?</i>

373
00:18:30,697 --> 00:18:31,732
<i>You gotta do me a favour.</i>

374
00:18:32,097 --> 00:18:34,691
<i>- Elaine, I really have-
- Hold on a second, Mrs. Seinfeld.</i>

375
00:18:34,897 --> 00:18:37,092
<i>I need your sample.</i>

376
00:18:37,257 --> 00:18:38,656
<i>You want my urine?</i>

377
00:18:38,857 --> 00:18:40,973
<i>I need a clean urine sample
from a woman.</i>

378
00:18:41,177 --> 00:18:43,850
<i>- I don't know.
- Oh, please, Mrs. Seinfeld, please?</i>

379
00:18:44,057 --> 00:18:45,649
<i>Well, what am I gonna do it in?</i>

380
00:18:46,697 --> 00:18:49,655
<i>- Well, one of those glasses.
- Jerry's glasses?</i>

381
00:18:49,857 --> 00:18:53,896
<i>Oh, yeah. He won't mind.
Come on, you're his mom.</i>

382
00:18:55,137 --> 00:18:57,651
<i>I could- Should I use a coffee cup?</i>

383
00:18:57,817 --> 00:19:00,490
<i>- Yeah, coffee cup's fine.
- Or maybe I could use a juice glass.</i>

384
00:19:00,657 --> 00:19:02,773
<i>Yes, yes. Fine, fine.
A juice glass. It's perfect.</i>

385
00:19:02,977 --> 00:19:05,252
<i>- This one is kind of scratched.
- It doesn't matter.</i>

386
00:19:05,417 --> 00:19:08,489
<i>- All right. How-? A milk glass.
- A milk glass, a juice glass.</i>

387
00:19:08,657 --> 00:19:11,490
<i>- Any glass, just pick a glass.
- Jerry really doesn't...</i>

388
00:19:11,657 --> 00:19:14,535
<i>- ... wash these very well.
- Mrs. Seinfeld, choose a glass.</i>

389
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:17,092
<i>Pick a glass, Mrs. Seinfeld.</i>

390
00:19:18,377 --> 00:19:20,129
<i>All right. I got everything here.</i>

391
00:19:20,297 --> 00:19:22,094
<i>I got the Cyclone F series...</i>

392
00:19:22,297 --> 00:19:25,255
<i>...Hydra Jet Flow, Stockholm
Superstream, you name it.</i>

393
00:19:25,457 --> 00:19:26,856
<i>What do you recommend?</i>

394
00:19:27,057 --> 00:19:29,412
<i>- What are you looking for?
- Power, man, power.</i>

395
00:19:29,577 --> 00:19:30,851
<i>Like Silkwood.</i>

396
00:19:31,017 --> 00:19:33,895
- That's for radiation.
- That's right.

397
00:19:34,097 --> 00:19:35,928
Now, what is this?

398
00:19:36,137 --> 00:19:38,128
<i>That's the Commando 450.
I don't sell that one.</i>

399
00:19:38,337 --> 00:19:40,089
<i>No, that's what we want,
the Commando 450.</i>

400
00:19:40,297 --> 00:19:42,891
<i>No, believe me. That's only used
in the circus for elephants.</i>

401
00:19:43,097 --> 00:19:44,894
<i>- Just give it to us.
- We'll pay anything.</i>

402
00:19:45,057 --> 00:19:47,173
<i>- Give me the money.
- We've got the...</i>

403
00:19:47,337 --> 00:19:49,851
<i>- What about Jerry?
- He couldn't handle that.</i>

404
00:19:50,017 --> 00:19:51,291
<i>He's delicate.</i>

405
00:19:52,497 --> 00:19:55,569
<i>It's nice being back at Leo's.
Jerry's place was too small.</i>

406
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:57,529
<i>First Leo breaks up,
then he goes back.</i>

407
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,688
<i>What the hell's going on?</i>

408
00:19:59,857 --> 00:20:01,848
<i>- Who is it?
- It's the super.</i>

409
00:20:02,017 --> 00:20:06,135
<i>We're installing new low-flow
showerheads in all the bathrooms.</i>

410
00:20:06,297 --> 00:20:07,696
Low-flow?

411
00:20:07,857 --> 00:20:09,973
<i>I don't like the sound of that.</i>

412
00:20:10,937 --> 00:20:13,974
<i>So as a result of your test
being free of opium...</i>

413
00:20:14,137 --> 00:20:17,413
<i>- ... I am reinstating you.
- Oh, yes!</i>

414
00:20:17,577 --> 00:20:19,533
What a load off.

415
00:20:19,737 --> 00:20:21,932
<i>So when are we going to Africa?</i>

416
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:23,655
<i>I'm afraid I can't take you.</i>

417
00:20:24,777 --> 00:20:26,210
What? Why not?

418
00:20:26,377 --> 00:20:29,414
<i>Elaine, according to your
urine analysis, you're menopausal.</i>

419
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:33,486
<i>You have the metabolism
of a 68-year-old woman.</i>

420
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:35,330
<i>But I wanted to see the Bushmen.</i>

421
00:20:35,697 --> 00:20:37,449
<i>Oh, and one more thing.</i>

422
00:20:37,617 --> 00:20:39,016
<i>You may have osteoporosis.</i>

423
00:20:41,217 --> 00:20:43,492
<i>- Well, it's been a great visit.
- Jerry, I'll tell you.</i>

424
00:20:43,657 --> 00:20:46,694
<i>First thing I'm gonna do when
I get back to Florida is take a shower.</i>

425
00:20:46,897 --> 00:20:49,252
<i>At least the Costanzas
changed their mind about moving.</i>

426
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:52,608
<i>- They couldn't bear leaving George.
- George must be happy about that.</i>

427
00:20:53,137 --> 00:20:55,048
<i>You have no idea.</i>

428
00:20:56,777 --> 00:20:58,927
<i>Take my swim trunks.
I won't need them.</i>

429
00:20:59,137 --> 00:21:01,731
<i>What does he want
with your swim trunks?</i>

430
00:21:02,017 --> 00:21:03,689
<i>Why should they go to waste?</i>

431
00:21:12,737 --> 00:21:14,614
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>
