1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,298
I've never been any place
there was no coffee.

2
00:00:05,787 --> 00:00:07,698
And people constantly try
to give you coffee.

3
00:00:07,867 --> 00:00:10,745
"Who's having coffee?
Can I get you some coffee?"

4
00:00:10,907 --> 00:00:12,943
Coffee's one of the only things
you can have...

5
00:00:13,107 --> 00:00:15,575
...that people continue
to try and give it to you.

6
00:00:15,827 --> 00:00:18,978
Waitresses ask, "Can I fill it up?
Can I warm it up? Can I top it off?"

7
00:00:19,147 --> 00:00:20,626
You could lift up a manhole cover:

8
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:23,221
"We just made a fresh pot.
Would you like some?"

9
00:00:25,787 --> 00:00:27,015
It has taken over humanity.

10
00:00:27,187 --> 00:00:30,304
There are coffee machines
we have to call "mister."

11
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:37,137
"Coffee anyone?"
"Hey, that's Mr. Coffee to you."

12
00:00:42,907 --> 00:00:46,104
Then I hear this rabbi on television.
I mean, imagine.

13
00:00:46,267 --> 00:00:48,383
I'm really sorry, George.

14
00:00:48,547 --> 00:00:52,506
I wasn't jealous of you.
It was just the whole marriage thing.

15
00:00:52,667 --> 00:00:54,419
You know, I was just
a little surprised.

16
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:57,226
Why would anyone eat canned fruit?

17
00:00:57,387 --> 00:00:59,696
I mean, can anybody answer that?

18
00:00:59,867 --> 00:01:03,064
- What about all the "loser"stuff?
- I don't know where the rabbi got that.

19
00:01:03,227 --> 00:01:08,176
You know, I never said that.
I said, "I've never seen you looser."

20
00:01:08,987 --> 00:01:11,057
I could see the can
if you're in the Army.

21
00:01:11,227 --> 00:01:14,025
But fresh fruit, it's available.
It's there.

22
00:01:14,187 --> 00:01:16,098
It's two aisles over.

23
00:01:17,267 --> 00:01:20,100
Well, scintillating as always.

24
00:01:20,267 --> 00:01:22,827
- Where you going?
- I'm going shopping with Susan.

25
00:01:22,987 --> 00:01:25,103
- What kind of shopping?
- Clothes shopping.

26
00:01:25,267 --> 00:01:26,905
- Where you going?
- Ross'.

27
00:01:27,067 --> 00:01:28,944
- That's a nice store.
- It's her uncle's.

28
00:01:29,187 --> 00:01:32,065
- Discount?
- One would hope.

29
00:01:34,907 --> 00:01:36,977
So my friend and I,
we were going to the movies...

30
00:01:37,147 --> 00:01:39,615
...and we stopped off
and bought this café latte.

31
00:01:39,787 --> 00:01:41,743
- Is that Italian coffee?
- Yeah, that's right.

32
00:01:41,907 --> 00:01:44,023
- Half milk, half coffee?
- Yeah.

33
00:01:44,627 --> 00:01:47,221
- You take a sip?
- Yes, I did.

34
00:01:47,387 --> 00:01:49,059
When you did,
did you notice it was hot?

35
00:01:49,227 --> 00:01:50,899
Could you sip it
in your normal fashion?

36
00:01:51,267 --> 00:01:53,861
No, I wasn't able to sip it
in my normal fashion.

37
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:55,899
All right, all right.

38
00:01:56,467 --> 00:01:57,616
You take big sips?

39
00:01:58,307 --> 00:01:59,979
Well, I think I take a normal sip.

40
00:02:00,147 --> 00:02:02,661
Okay, you take normal sips.
Nothing wrong with that.

41
00:02:02,827 --> 00:02:05,295
- Then what happened?
- Well, you know...

42
00:02:05,467 --> 00:02:08,664
...they don't allow outside drinks
in the movie theatre...

43
00:02:08,827 --> 00:02:10,977
...so I had to put it in my shirt
and sneak it in.

44
00:02:11,147 --> 00:02:13,456
Yeah, see, they like
to sell their own coffee.

45
00:02:13,627 --> 00:02:15,857
- Is that gonna be a problem?
- Yeah, it's a problem.

46
00:02:16,027 --> 00:02:17,346
It'll be a problem for them.

47
00:02:17,507 --> 00:02:19,702
It's a clear violation of
your rights as a consumer.

48
00:02:19,867 --> 00:02:21,778
An infringement
on your constitutional rights.

49
00:02:21,947 --> 00:02:24,780
It's outrageous,
egregious, preposterous.

50
00:02:25,227 --> 00:02:27,218
It's definitely preposterous.

51
00:02:27,387 --> 00:02:28,979
So then what happened?

52
00:02:29,147 --> 00:02:33,538
Well, I was trying to get to my seat,
and I had to step over someone...

53
00:02:33,707 --> 00:02:35,937
...and I kind of got pushed,
and it spilled on me.

54
00:02:36,107 --> 00:02:38,177
- Was there a top on it?
- Yeah.

55
00:02:38,347 --> 00:02:40,815
Did you put the top on,
or did they put it on for you?

56
00:02:40,987 --> 00:02:43,217
- They put the top on.
- And they made the top.

57
00:02:43,387 --> 00:02:45,378
You didn't make the top, did you?

58
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,261
Suzy, I want you to go down
to Java World.

59
00:02:50,427 --> 00:02:52,895
Get me a café latte with a top.

60
00:02:53,067 --> 00:02:54,978
We're gonna run
some tests on that top.

61
00:02:56,987 --> 00:02:59,057
- Have you been to the doctor?
- No. No, I haven't.

62
00:02:59,627 --> 00:03:01,538
Suzy, call Dr. Bison.

63
00:03:01,707 --> 00:03:04,301
Set up an appointment for Mr. Kramer.
Tell him it's for me.

64
00:03:04,467 --> 00:03:07,379
- So, what do you think, Mr. Chiles?
- Jackie.

65
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:11,382
- Jackie. I mean, we got a chance?
- Do we have a chance?

66
00:03:11,547 --> 00:03:13,265
Get me one coffee drinker
on that jury...

67
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:15,179
...you gonna walk out of there
a rich man.

68
00:03:19,107 --> 00:03:21,382
I don't like it. It's red.
It's too flashy.

69
00:03:21,547 --> 00:03:23,458
Well, you could use a little flash.

70
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:26,859
All right, don't change me.
Susan, don't change me.

71
00:03:27,027 --> 00:03:30,656
There's a lot of women that would love
to be in your position right now.

72
00:03:31,507 --> 00:03:33,065
Name one.

73
00:03:33,227 --> 00:03:34,819
So did you find anything?

74
00:03:34,987 --> 00:03:38,263
Oh, he is impossible
to shop for, Uncle Ned.

75
00:03:39,547 --> 00:03:41,105
I'm going on vacation to Costa Rica.

76
00:03:41,267 --> 00:03:42,985
Maybe I'll see you
in a couple of weeks.

77
00:03:43,147 --> 00:03:45,263
Excuse me, Mr. Ross.

78
00:03:47,547 --> 00:03:49,902
- See, now, this I don't get.
- What?

79
00:03:50,107 --> 00:03:52,257
- The security guard.
- What about him?

80
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:53,986
Why does he have to stand?

81
00:03:55,507 --> 00:03:57,577
Because he's a security guard.

82
00:03:57,747 --> 00:03:59,021
I mean, look at him.

83
00:03:59,187 --> 00:04:02,020
He's gotta be on his feet like that
all day? I mean, that's brutal.

84
00:04:02,187 --> 00:04:04,985
- I'm gonna say something to your uncle.
- George, you just met him.

85
00:04:05,147 --> 00:04:07,058
Don't say anything to him.

86
00:04:07,227 --> 00:04:09,582
Aren't you concerned
about the security guard?

87
00:04:09,947 --> 00:04:11,141
Not really.

88
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:15,223
She's not concerned
about the security guard.

89
00:04:15,387 --> 00:04:16,536
What kind of person is this?

90
00:04:16,827 --> 00:04:18,624
I'm marrying a person
who doesn't care...

91
00:04:18,787 --> 00:04:20,698
...this man has to stand
eight hours a day...

92
00:04:20,867 --> 00:04:22,346
...when he could easily
be sitting.

93
00:04:22,507 --> 00:04:24,975
All right, George.
What do you think?

94
00:04:27,707 --> 00:04:30,699
- So, what did you do last night?
- Nothing.

95
00:04:30,867 --> 00:04:32,505
I know, but what did you
actually do?

96
00:04:32,667 --> 00:04:36,660
Literally nothing.
I sat in a chair and I stared.

97
00:04:37,227 --> 00:04:39,946
- Wow, that really is nothing.
- I told you.

98
00:04:40,667 --> 00:04:41,861
- Hey.
- Hey.

99
00:04:42,027 --> 00:04:43,221
What are you dressed up for?

100
00:04:43,387 --> 00:04:46,026
I just came from a meeting
with my lawyer.

101
00:04:46,187 --> 00:04:48,417
- How's that looking?
- I'll tell you how it's looking.

102
00:04:48,587 --> 00:04:51,147
My lawyer says if there's
one coffee drinker on that jury...

103
00:04:51,307 --> 00:04:53,138
...I'm gonna be a rich man.

104
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,663
Oh, that's despicable.

105
00:04:55,827 --> 00:04:58,261
How does he know
how all coffee drinkers will vote?

106
00:04:58,427 --> 00:05:01,863
I'm a coffee drinker. If I was on
that jury, I wouldn't give you a nickel.

107
00:05:02,027 --> 00:05:05,656
Well, you wouldn't be on that jury.
He would've weeded you out.

108
00:05:07,667 --> 00:05:09,544
Frankly, I'm surprised
you're so litigious.

109
00:05:09,707 --> 00:05:11,937
Oh, I can be quite litigious.

110
00:05:12,107 --> 00:05:13,335
Whoever heard of this anyway?

111
00:05:13,507 --> 00:05:16,419
Suing a company
because their coffee is too hot?

112
00:05:16,587 --> 00:05:20,819
- Coffee is supposed to be hot.
- But Jackie says the top was faulty.

113
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,865
Jackie says the top was faulty.

114
00:05:26,707 --> 00:05:28,140
- Hey, Maestro.
- Kramer.

115
00:05:28,307 --> 00:05:29,945
- I'm in here. How's it going?
- Fine.

116
00:05:30,107 --> 00:05:31,825
Hi, Bob.

117
00:05:32,987 --> 00:05:35,979
I'm sorry. Maestro.

118
00:05:36,147 --> 00:05:37,865
Oh, boy. This is a surprise.
Look at you.

119
00:05:38,027 --> 00:05:41,736
I just wanted to drop off
this Chinese balm for your burns.

120
00:05:41,907 --> 00:05:44,580
It's supposed to be great stuff.
It's all herbal.

121
00:05:44,747 --> 00:05:48,660
Oh, Maestro, what are you doing?
You don't have to do this.

122
00:05:48,827 --> 00:05:51,022
- Do you believe this Maestro?
- It's nothing.

123
00:05:51,187 --> 00:05:53,143
You know, you haven't
been around for a while.

124
00:05:53,307 --> 00:05:55,059
Oh, yeah. I've been
at my house in Tuscany.

125
00:05:55,227 --> 00:05:58,060
Tuscany, huh? You hear that, Jerry?
That's in Italy. Yeah.

126
00:05:58,427 --> 00:05:59,655
I hear it's beautiful there.

127
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:02,899
Well, if you're thinking
of getting a place there, don't bother.

128
00:06:03,067 --> 00:06:05,376
There's really nothing available.

129
00:06:06,827 --> 00:06:08,977
- Hello.
- Well, hello.

130
00:06:09,147 --> 00:06:12,184
- And who might you be?
- I might be Elaine.

131
00:06:12,347 --> 00:06:14,383
- This is Bob Cobb.
- Maestro.

132
00:06:15,787 --> 00:06:19,223
- Maestro?
- It is my very great pleasure.

133
00:06:23,027 --> 00:06:24,779
- I have to get going.
- I have to be going.

134
00:06:24,947 --> 00:06:26,983
Jinx. Buy me a Coke.

135
00:06:27,147 --> 00:06:30,378
- I love it when that happens.
- I know, I know. That is so...

136
00:06:30,547 --> 00:06:32,378
- Coincidental.
- Yeah.

137
00:06:32,547 --> 00:06:34,299
- Okay, bye, you guys.
- Yeah, yeah.

138
00:06:34,467 --> 00:06:36,185
- Ciao.
- Yeah, see you. Oh, hey.

139
00:06:36,347 --> 00:06:39,623
Thanks for the balm. Yeah.

140
00:06:45,147 --> 00:06:47,217
You know
you hurt the Maestro's feelings.

141
00:06:47,387 --> 00:06:49,981
- Because I didn't call him Maestro?
- That's right.

142
00:06:50,147 --> 00:06:52,422
I feel a little funny
calling somebody Maestro.

143
00:06:52,587 --> 00:06:54,976
- Why?
- It's a stupid thing to be called.

144
00:06:55,147 --> 00:06:57,138
- Jerry, he's a conductor.
- Oh, conductor?

145
00:06:57,307 --> 00:07:00,982
He conducts the Policemen's
Benevolent Association Orchestra.

146
00:07:01,147 --> 00:07:02,899
Well, he's still a conductor.

147
00:07:03,067 --> 00:07:04,898
He sure worked
pretty fast with Elaine.

148
00:07:05,067 --> 00:07:07,376
You should see him do
"Flight of the Bumblebee."

149
00:07:07,547 --> 00:07:09,378
He just...

150
00:07:11,227 --> 00:07:12,706
New shirt?

151
00:07:12,987 --> 00:07:15,501
- Yeah, you like it?
- No. Not particularly.

152
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:17,146
- Why? The colour?
- Yeah.

153
00:07:17,307 --> 00:07:19,775
- Too flashy?
- Yeah, it's burning my retina.

154
00:07:22,707 --> 00:07:24,425
Susan picked that out
for you, right?

155
00:07:24,587 --> 00:07:26,020
No.

156
00:07:27,867 --> 00:07:30,176
All right, what's it gonna be here?

157
00:07:30,347 --> 00:07:31,780
Let me ask you something.

158
00:07:31,947 --> 00:07:33,858
When you're in a store,
does it bother you...

159
00:07:34,027 --> 00:07:36,621
...that they make the security guard
stand there all day?

160
00:07:37,467 --> 00:07:39,059
No.

161
00:07:39,467 --> 00:07:41,344
See, it didn't bother Susan either.

162
00:07:41,507 --> 00:07:42,906
That's why I'm different.

163
00:07:43,067 --> 00:07:45,945
I can sense
the slightest human suffering.

164
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:49,142
Are you sensing anything
right now?

165
00:07:53,147 --> 00:07:54,296
Let me just say this.

166
00:07:54,467 --> 00:07:56,697
It's inhumane to make a man stand
on his feet...

167
00:07:56,867 --> 00:07:58,778
...in one spot for eight hours a day.

168
00:07:58,947 --> 00:08:00,824
Why shouldn't he have a chair?

169
00:08:01,067 --> 00:08:03,786
What about criminal activity?
He's gotta be alert.

170
00:08:03,947 --> 00:08:06,381
He can't jump out of the chair?
How long does that take?

171
00:08:06,547 --> 00:08:09,380
Look at this. Here, watch.
Criminals. Boom, I'm up.

172
00:08:09,547 --> 00:08:11,856
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

173
00:08:12,827 --> 00:08:15,136
Maybe they offered him a chair
and he turned it down.

174
00:08:15,307 --> 00:08:17,741
Would you get out of here.
Who's gonna turn down a chair?

175
00:08:17,907 --> 00:08:20,626
I'd be very interested to know
how he felt about all this.

176
00:08:20,787 --> 00:08:23,062
- Maybe I'll have a talk with him.
- I know you will.

177
00:08:23,227 --> 00:08:25,138
Hey, hey. Listen to this.

178
00:08:25,307 --> 00:08:26,979
- Jackie just called.
- Who?

179
00:08:27,147 --> 00:08:28,865
- His lawyer.
- Java World wants to settle.

180
00:08:29,027 --> 00:08:30,585
- What?
- Yeah, I'm gonna be rich.

181
00:08:31,267 --> 00:08:34,100
- Why are they settling?
- They're afraid of bad publicity.

182
00:08:34,267 --> 00:08:36,303
All this because
you spilled coffee on yourself?

183
00:08:36,467 --> 00:08:38,458
Yeah, that's right.

184
00:08:39,507 --> 00:08:43,136
I'm gonna need a coffee here!
Very hot! Boiling!

185
00:08:44,027 --> 00:08:46,461
And then, about four years ago...

186
00:08:46,627 --> 00:08:51,701
...I was on holiday in Tuscany,
and I fell in love with this house.

187
00:08:51,867 --> 00:08:53,619
Are you ready to order?

188
00:08:54,427 --> 00:08:55,860
Gosh, what are you getting, Bob?

189
00:08:59,267 --> 00:09:02,020
Good question.
We'll need a few minutes.

190
00:09:02,187 --> 00:09:03,984
Thanks.

191
00:09:05,627 --> 00:09:08,141
You know, I'm sorry, but...

192
00:09:08,747 --> 00:09:13,741
I didn't mention it earlier, but,
actually, I prefer to be called Maestro.

193
00:09:15,067 --> 00:09:18,901
- Excuse me?
- Well, you know, I am a conductor.

194
00:09:19,227 --> 00:09:20,740
Yeah. So?

195
00:09:20,907 --> 00:09:24,422
I suppose it's okay for Leonard
Bernstein to be called Maestro...

196
00:09:24,587 --> 00:09:26,862
...because he conducted
the New York Philharmonic.

197
00:09:27,027 --> 00:09:29,461
So he gets to be called Maestro
and I don't.

198
00:09:32,507 --> 00:09:35,544
Well, don't you think
that he was probably called Maestro...

199
00:09:35,707 --> 00:09:38,426
...while he was conducting.
Not in social situations.

200
00:09:38,587 --> 00:09:40,737
I mean, his friends
probably just called him Lenny.

201
00:09:40,907 --> 00:09:45,423
I happen to know for a fact that he was
called Maestro in social situations.

202
00:09:45,587 --> 00:09:47,543
I once saw him in a bar,
and somebody said:

203
00:09:47,707 --> 00:09:51,461
"Hello, Maestro, how about a beer?"
Okay? So that's a fact.

204
00:09:52,747 --> 00:09:54,817
Maestro, huh?

205
00:09:55,747 --> 00:09:57,465
Okay.

206
00:09:57,827 --> 00:09:59,340
Maestro.

207
00:10:08,467 --> 00:10:10,822
Jerry! Jerry!

208
00:10:13,547 --> 00:10:16,345
Jerry, my burn, it's gone, look.

209
00:10:17,027 --> 00:10:19,143
- What do you mean?
- I put that Chinese balm on it.

210
00:10:19,307 --> 00:10:21,298
- Look, it healed it.
- So?

211
00:10:21,467 --> 00:10:23,935
So my lawsuit. I'm finished.

212
00:10:24,107 --> 00:10:27,179
- I thought they wanted to settle.
- What happens if they wanna see it?

213
00:10:27,947 --> 00:10:30,177
- Then you're in a lot of trouble.
- Yeah!

214
00:10:49,187 --> 00:10:51,985
- Tired?
- No.

215
00:10:53,227 --> 00:10:55,343
How come no chair?

216
00:10:56,267 --> 00:10:57,780
What?

217
00:10:57,947 --> 00:11:00,905
I couldn't help but notice
that you don't have a chair.

218
00:11:01,067 --> 00:11:03,535
- I don't need a chair.
- I didn't mean to imply you did.

219
00:11:03,707 --> 00:11:06,585
You're obviously
a very well-proportioned individual.

220
00:11:07,987 --> 00:11:10,296
What I was just wondering is...

221
00:11:10,907 --> 00:11:12,818
...have they ever
offered you a chair?

222
00:11:13,107 --> 00:11:15,701
- No.
- Would you like a chair?

223
00:11:15,867 --> 00:11:17,903
I suppose if they gave me one
I'd sit down.

224
00:11:18,827 --> 00:11:20,021
You would, wouldn't you?

225
00:11:20,187 --> 00:11:22,747
Obviously I'd rather sit,
if that's what you're asking.

226
00:11:22,907 --> 00:11:24,943
- That's exactly my point.
- Who wouldn't?

227
00:11:25,587 --> 00:11:27,179
Because, I tell you, frankly...

228
00:11:27,347 --> 00:11:30,942
...I'd like to walk in here one day
and find you sitting down.

229
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,985
That would give me
a lot of pleasure.

230
00:11:34,387 --> 00:11:35,661
Call me crazy.

231
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,177
You put the balm on?
Who told you to put the balm on?

232
00:11:40,347 --> 00:11:42,577
I didn't tell you to.
Why'd you put the balm on?

233
00:11:42,747 --> 00:11:44,305
You haven't even been
to the doctor.

234
00:11:44,467 --> 00:11:46,378
Let a doctor put a balm on.

235
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:50,224
- I guess I screwed up, huh, Jackie?
- You're damn right, you screwed up.

236
00:11:50,387 --> 00:11:52,025
Where'd you get
that damn balm anyway?

237
00:11:52,187 --> 00:11:53,939
- The Maestro.
- The who?

238
00:11:54,107 --> 00:11:56,575
- What you talking about, Maestro?
- My friend's a conductor.

239
00:11:57,187 --> 00:11:59,781
So a maestro tells you
to put a balm on, and you do it?

240
00:11:59,947 --> 00:12:01,619
Well, my stomach was burning.

241
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:04,096
I'll tell you what this is.
It's a public humiliation.

242
00:12:04,267 --> 00:12:07,543
- I didn't know the balm would work.
- Do you know what a balm is?

243
00:12:07,707 --> 00:12:10,426
You ever seen a balm?
Didn't you read the instructions?

244
00:12:10,587 --> 00:12:14,057
No one can tell what a balm's
gonna do. They're unpredictable.

245
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,341
All right, I'm sorry, Jackie.

246
00:12:17,467 --> 00:12:20,982
- Pull over here, driver. This is it.
- Yeah, get over.

247
00:12:22,227 --> 00:12:24,422
- You have a good time?
- Yeah, he's very interesting.

248
00:12:24,587 --> 00:12:27,181
Did you know that Mozart died
while writing the "Requiem"?

249
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:30,145
Yeah. Everyone knows that.
It was in Amadeus.

250
00:12:30,307 --> 00:12:31,706
Really?

251
00:12:31,907 --> 00:12:34,216
What about the name?
Did he make you call him Maestro?

252
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:36,457
- Yeah, I called him Maestro.
- You didn't mind?

253
00:12:36,747 --> 00:12:40,262
Well, I did at first,
but, actually, I kind of got used to it.

254
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,895
Okay, from now on, I want you
to call me Jerry the Great.

255
00:12:43,067 --> 00:12:45,979
- I'm not calling you Jerry the Great.
- Why not? You call him Maestro.

256
00:12:46,147 --> 00:12:48,024
- He is a maestro.
- Well, I'm great.

257
00:12:48,187 --> 00:12:50,303
So you say.

258
00:12:50,907 --> 00:12:52,977
What about his house in Tuscany?
He mention that?

259
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,217
Yeah. I'm invited.

260
00:12:55,387 --> 00:12:58,902
When I told him it was beautiful there,
out of the clear blue sky, he says:

261
00:12:59,067 --> 00:13:02,264
"There's nothing to rent,"as if
he doesn't want anyone else there.

262
00:13:02,427 --> 00:13:03,621
Why?

263
00:13:03,787 --> 00:13:05,505
Maybe he's embarrassed
by Americans.

264
00:13:05,667 --> 00:13:07,783
Well, maybe there aren't
any houses to rent there.

265
00:13:07,947 --> 00:13:10,415
In all of Tuscany? I wonder.

266
00:13:12,587 --> 00:13:15,704
I say we offer him $50,000, that's it.
Take it or leave it.

267
00:13:15,867 --> 00:13:18,062
How do we know
how severe the burns are?

268
00:13:18,227 --> 00:13:19,819
Let's have him
examined by a doctor.

269
00:13:19,987 --> 00:13:22,296
Listen, the faster
we dispose of this, the better.

270
00:13:22,467 --> 00:13:24,503
This thing gets into the paper,
it'll kill us.

271
00:13:24,667 --> 00:13:27,818
All right, we'll start with 50,000
and free coffee at all of our stores.

272
00:13:29,467 --> 00:13:33,255
- Yes?
- Mr. Chiles and Mr. Kramer are here.

273
00:13:33,427 --> 00:13:34,985
Send them in.

274
00:13:39,067 --> 00:13:40,500
Gentlemen.

275
00:13:41,627 --> 00:13:43,379
Gentlemen, come in.

276
00:13:46,427 --> 00:13:48,816
Now, we don't want to take up
much of your time.

277
00:13:48,987 --> 00:13:50,659
Let's make this short and sweet.

278
00:13:52,027 --> 00:13:55,417
We're prepared to offer you
all the free coffee you want...

279
00:13:55,587 --> 00:13:58,659
...at any of our stores throughout
North America and Europe, plus-

280
00:13:58,827 --> 00:14:00,658
I'll take it!

281
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:11,823
"I'll take it"? "I'll take it"?
Who told you to take it?

282
00:14:11,987 --> 00:14:13,420
- Did I tell you to take it?
- No.

283
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:15,657
The Maestro didn't tell you to.
He wasn't there.

284
00:14:15,827 --> 00:14:18,261
- We were lucky to get anything.
- Free coffee?

285
00:14:18,427 --> 00:14:20,179
- Yeah.
- I don't want free coffee.

286
00:14:20,347 --> 00:14:22,383
It's not hard to get coffee.
I can get it myself.

287
00:14:22,547 --> 00:14:24,344
I wanna know
what came after that "plus."

288
00:14:24,507 --> 00:14:26,577
I didn't hear any "plus."

289
00:14:26,747 --> 00:14:29,261
Twenty years, I've never experienced
anything like this.

290
00:14:29,427 --> 00:14:31,736
Look, Java World.
Hey, listen, I'm getting out here.

291
00:14:31,907 --> 00:14:34,705
I'm gonna get myself
a free café latte.

292
00:14:43,627 --> 00:14:45,219
Hey.

293
00:14:45,387 --> 00:14:47,059
Hi, Maestro.

294
00:14:55,267 --> 00:14:57,178
- "Beethoven's 7th."
- Yeah.

295
00:14:57,347 --> 00:14:59,178
- We were just talking about you.
- Oh, yeah?

296
00:14:59,347 --> 00:15:02,339
The other day, you mentioned
there were no houses in Tuscany.

297
00:15:02,507 --> 00:15:04,020
You didn't find one, did you?

298
00:15:04,187 --> 00:15:07,941
- No. Not really looking.
- Nor should you.

299
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:11,816
But are you telling me there's not
one house to rent in all of Tuscany?

300
00:15:11,987 --> 00:15:14,740
The houses are passed down
from generation to generation.

301
00:15:14,907 --> 00:15:16,625
It's very hard.

302
00:15:16,787 --> 00:15:20,666
I can't get a sublet,
a guest room, a cot, nothing?

303
00:15:20,827 --> 00:15:24,706
- It's booked solid.
- It's booked, Jerry.

304
00:15:24,867 --> 00:15:26,664
- How'd you get yours?
- Got lucky.

305
00:15:26,827 --> 00:15:30,820
Come on, Elaine, let's take a ride.
I was about to pop in some Verdi.

306
00:15:39,067 --> 00:15:41,297
Maybe I'll check out France.

307
00:15:43,227 --> 00:15:44,979
Hey, George.
Hey, you believe this guy?

308
00:15:45,147 --> 00:15:46,899
- Who?
- Bob Cobb.

309
00:15:47,067 --> 00:15:50,696
- Bob Cobb?
- You know, the Maestro.

310
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:51,856
I missed the Maestro?

311
00:15:52,027 --> 00:15:55,702
Get this, he tells me there are no
houses anywhere in Tuscany to rent.

312
00:15:57,467 --> 00:16:00,300
- You renting a house in Tuscany?
- No.

313
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:01,941
So, what do you care?

314
00:16:07,507 --> 00:16:10,579
I wish I could figure out if this guy's
trying to keep me out of Tuscany.

315
00:16:10,747 --> 00:16:13,978
Of course he is. There's got
to be houses for rent in Tuscany.

316
00:16:14,147 --> 00:16:16,502
- Do you know how big Tuscany is?
- I have no idea.

317
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:19,181
It's huge.
It's probably like North Dakota.

318
00:16:19,347 --> 00:16:22,384
- Oh, no way it's that big.
- It's a big region.

319
00:16:22,547 --> 00:16:24,503
You know how big
North Dakota is, stupid?

320
00:16:26,427 --> 00:16:29,100
- Why do I bother talking to you?
- There's no gun to your head.

321
00:16:29,267 --> 00:16:30,700
All right.

322
00:16:32,987 --> 00:16:35,376
- So I spoke to the security guard.
- Yeah? And?

323
00:16:35,547 --> 00:16:37,026
It was tough to get a good read...

324
00:16:37,187 --> 00:16:40,384
...but I think if I brought him
a chair, he'd sit.

325
00:16:40,747 --> 00:16:43,864
- So you're gonna get him a chair?
- Yeah. It's a question of what kind.

326
00:16:44,027 --> 00:16:46,461
- Thinking about a barstool.
- That'd give him some height.

327
00:16:46,627 --> 00:16:49,141
Be able to check things out.
With a back or without?

328
00:16:49,307 --> 00:16:50,535
I think I'd go for the back.

329
00:16:50,707 --> 00:16:52,777
- Swivel?
- I suppose he could swivel.

330
00:16:55,027 --> 00:16:58,099
- Maybe one of those director's chairs.
- That's kind of a pompous look.

331
00:17:00,627 --> 00:17:03,300
My parents had a kitchen chair
that would've been perfect.

332
00:17:03,467 --> 00:17:04,820
- One of those vinyl things?
- Yes.

333
00:17:04,987 --> 00:17:06,978
Vinyl, yeah. Maybe.

334
00:17:07,387 --> 00:17:11,824
How can I figure out if there's
any places to rent in Tuscany?

335
00:17:12,187 --> 00:17:14,826
Wait a minute.
Poppie's from Tuscany.

336
00:17:15,227 --> 00:17:17,297
- I'm gonna go call him.
- Yeah, good luck.

337
00:17:18,267 --> 00:17:20,178
Hey, I'll meet you outside.

338
00:17:31,387 --> 00:17:34,743
Poppie told me to talk to his cousin.
He lives down in Little Italy.

339
00:17:34,907 --> 00:17:36,784
What do you think
about a rocking chair?

340
00:17:36,947 --> 00:17:39,256
You can't limit my café lattes.
It says so right here.

341
00:17:39,427 --> 00:17:42,624
And no dirty looks. If I want
a café latte, you give me a café latte.

342
00:17:42,787 --> 00:17:45,017
If I have any problems,
I'll get my lawyer down here.

343
00:17:45,187 --> 00:17:46,506
You'll be in big trouble.

344
00:17:47,227 --> 00:17:49,741
Hey, hey, slow down, Eddie.
What's the matter?

345
00:17:49,907 --> 00:17:52,216
They're making faces
because I've had some café lattes.

346
00:17:52,387 --> 00:17:55,459
But I can have as many café lattes
as I want. That was the settlement.

347
00:17:55,627 --> 00:17:57,902
- That's it?
- That's it. You want one, George?

348
00:17:58,067 --> 00:18:00,581
Jerry, you want one?
They're delicious. My pleasure.

349
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:03,978
You've got to stop it.
You're all hopped up on the caffeine.

350
00:18:04,147 --> 00:18:07,059
- I feel like I'm talking a little faster.
- You're racing.

351
00:18:07,227 --> 00:18:09,138
Well, I got things to do.
See you later. Bye.

352
00:18:19,747 --> 00:18:21,180
Oh, Bob.

353
00:18:21,347 --> 00:18:22,826
Bob.

354
00:18:23,427 --> 00:18:25,657
Maestro.

355
00:18:26,067 --> 00:18:27,659
Maestro.

356
00:18:33,907 --> 00:18:36,580
Excuse me. Can I help you?

357
00:18:36,747 --> 00:18:39,386
No. Just giving a chair
to the security guard.

358
00:18:39,547 --> 00:18:41,378
Did Mr. Ross tell you to do this?

359
00:18:45,907 --> 00:18:48,501
- What's your name?
- Evan Fane.

360
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:50,703
I'm engaged to Mr. Ross' niece.

361
00:18:50,867 --> 00:18:52,858
I'll be taking over this whole
place someday...

362
00:18:53,027 --> 00:18:55,063
...so if I were you,
I'd stay on my good side.

363
00:18:55,587 --> 00:18:57,145
I'm terribly sorry. I didn't know.

364
00:18:57,307 --> 00:18:59,104
Innocent mistake.

365
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:05,225
Well, here you go.
What do you think?

366
00:19:05,507 --> 00:19:06,986
Mr. Ross said this was okay?

367
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:09,263
I'm his nephew, all right?
Don't worry about it.

368
00:19:09,427 --> 00:19:11,338
Go ahead. Check it out.

369
00:19:12,987 --> 00:19:14,181
Well...

370
00:19:20,987 --> 00:19:22,659
Not bad.

371
00:19:23,307 --> 00:19:25,138
Not bad at all.

372
00:19:31,707 --> 00:19:34,426
Excuse me,
I'm looking for a Mr. Ciccio.

373
00:19:35,547 --> 00:19:36,775
I'm Ciccio.

374
00:19:37,187 --> 00:19:39,064
Poppie sent me
to see you, Mr. Ciccio.

375
00:19:39,227 --> 00:19:40,626
Sì, sì, Poppie.

376
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:44,386
Did he mention to you why I called?

377
00:19:44,907 --> 00:19:47,467
- The house in Toscana.
- Yeah, right, right.

378
00:19:47,627 --> 00:19:49,299
So is there anything there to rent?

379
00:19:50,427 --> 00:19:52,622
Two million lire.
You give me the check.

380
00:19:52,787 --> 00:19:56,939
- No, I didn't actually want to rent it.
- The keys. Here are the keys.

381
00:19:57,107 --> 00:20:00,019
You give me the check.
Two million lire.

382
00:20:00,627 --> 00:20:03,619
Seventeen-hundred American.

383
00:20:14,027 --> 00:20:15,745
No, see...

384
00:20:16,187 --> 00:20:18,747
...I didn't say that I wanted to rent it.

385
00:20:18,907 --> 00:20:22,582
I was just wondering
if there were houses there to rent.

386
00:20:24,987 --> 00:20:26,705
This one.

387
00:20:56,787 --> 00:21:00,018
It's been a rough couple of weeks.
I really needed to get away.

388
00:21:00,187 --> 00:21:01,779
I told you.

389
00:21:01,947 --> 00:21:03,665
It's paradise.

390
00:21:03,827 --> 00:21:06,341
You were right, Maestro.

391
00:21:18,267 --> 00:21:20,019
Come on, Jerry, this guy's crazy.
Get out.

392
00:21:20,187 --> 00:21:22,860
I'm getting out.
You didn't have to push me.

393
00:21:24,467 --> 00:21:27,220
- How much did you pay that guy?
- Seventy-five thousand lire.

394
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:29,855
Seventy-five thousand lire?
Are you out of your mind?

395
00:21:30,027 --> 00:21:32,063
Kramer, you don't understand
the conversion rate.

396
00:21:32,227 --> 00:21:33,376
The conversion rates.

397
00:21:33,547 --> 00:21:36,505
- I don't even know why I brought you.
- Nobody put a gun to your head.

398
00:21:40,827 --> 00:21:42,021
- Not bad.
- Yeah.
