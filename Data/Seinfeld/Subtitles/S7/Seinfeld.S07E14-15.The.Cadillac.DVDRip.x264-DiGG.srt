1
00:01:02,838 --> 00:01:04,556
Old people in Florida,
they drive slow...

2
00:01:06,038 --> 00:01:07,756
...and they sit low.

3
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:11,269
Right? That is their motto.

4
00:01:11,558 --> 00:01:13,549
The state flag of Florida should be...

5
00:01:13,718 --> 00:01:16,073
...a steering wheel with a hat
and two knuckles on it.

6
00:01:21,798 --> 00:01:23,390
And that left-turn signal on...

7
00:01:23,558 --> 00:01:26,197
...from when they left the house
that morning.

8
00:01:26,358 --> 00:01:29,668
Right? That's a legal turn in Florida.

9
00:01:30,038 --> 00:01:32,916
It's known as an eventual left.

10
00:01:33,518 --> 00:01:36,430
And old people
get to a certain age...

11
00:01:36,598 --> 00:01:38,554
...where, when they back out
of the driveway...

12
00:01:38,718 --> 00:01:40,356
...they don't look.

13
00:01:40,518 --> 00:01:42,270
You know what I mean?
They just feel like:

14
00:01:42,438 --> 00:01:45,874
"Well, I'm old, and I'm coming back.

15
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:48,668
I survived. Let's see if you can."

16
00:01:57,838 --> 00:02:00,352
- Hey, you're back!
- Oh, I'm back, baby.

17
00:02:00,518 --> 00:02:02,668
- How was it?
- One of the best jobs I ever had.

18
00:02:02,838 --> 00:02:04,510
- Good for you.
- I killed.

19
00:02:04,678 --> 00:02:06,475
- You killed.
- Wiped the floor with them.

20
00:02:06,638 --> 00:02:09,152
And not only that,
the money was unbelievable.

21
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:12,435
- Unbelievable.
- Yeah, highest-paying job I ever had.

22
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:13,872
How much?

23
00:02:14,038 --> 00:02:15,630
- I'd rather not.
- Oh, come on.

24
00:02:15,798 --> 00:02:18,517
It's not good to talk about money.
It can affect the friendship.

25
00:02:18,678 --> 00:02:20,031
I tell you how much I make.

26
00:02:20,198 --> 00:02:21,677
And I'm always impressed.

27
00:02:21,838 --> 00:02:23,794
Just show me the check. Come on.

28
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:25,789
- You wanna see it?
- I wanna see it.

29
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:27,471
Okay.

30
00:02:27,998 --> 00:02:29,795
Check that out.

31
00:02:32,558 --> 00:02:34,708
- This is unbelievable.
- I told you.

32
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:37,346
My God, you're rich.

33
00:02:37,518 --> 00:02:38,746
Oh, yeah.

34
00:02:38,918 --> 00:02:41,352
I didn't know you made
that kind of money.

35
00:02:41,918 --> 00:02:43,556
- Gee.
- What?

36
00:02:43,718 --> 00:02:47,313
I just don't think
I can talk to you anymore.

37
00:02:47,878 --> 00:02:49,072
I feel inferior.

38
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:50,997
I never should have told you.

39
00:02:51,158 --> 00:02:54,036
You know, Jerry, I think
this changes the relationship.

40
00:02:54,198 --> 00:02:55,916
I mean, I feel it. Do you feel it?

41
00:02:56,078 --> 00:02:57,716
No, I can't feel anything.

42
00:02:57,878 --> 00:02:59,470
What are you gonna do with all that?

43
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:02,471
I was thinking of donating
a large portion of it to charity.

44
00:03:02,638 --> 00:03:04,356
- Really?
- No.

45
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:07,197
Well, you should, Jerry.

46
00:03:07,358 --> 00:03:10,156
To tell you the truth, I was thinking
of buying my father a car.

47
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:12,354
- You see, that's nice.
- Yeah, maybe a Cadillac.

48
00:03:12,518 --> 00:03:13,837
Cadillac.

49
00:03:13,998 --> 00:03:15,272
Yeah.

50
00:03:15,438 --> 00:03:17,588
That would blow his mind.
He's always wanted one...

51
00:03:17,758 --> 00:03:20,147
...his whole life. He's never
been able to afford it.

52
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:22,229
- I'll do it.
- You're gonna score big points...

53
00:03:22,398 --> 00:03:23,751
...with the man upstairs.

54
00:03:23,918 --> 00:03:26,034
Oh, isn't that what it's all about?

55
00:03:30,038 --> 00:03:31,915
Who was Pippi Longstocking?

56
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:35,070
Pippi Longstocking? I don't know.

57
00:03:35,238 --> 00:03:37,991
Did she have anything
to do with Hitler?

58
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:40,035
Hitler? Maybe.

59
00:03:40,198 --> 00:03:42,837
- Hey.
- Hey, George.

60
00:03:42,998 --> 00:03:45,956
Have you seen Jerry?
I told him 2:00.

61
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:49,153
You remember Katy?

62
00:03:49,678 --> 00:03:50,952
Oh, hi.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

63
00:03:51,118 --> 00:03:53,678
We met skiing that time.
You're married to the eye guy.

64
00:03:53,838 --> 00:03:56,636
Also ear, nose and throat.

65
00:03:57,478 --> 00:03:58,991
Nose.

66
00:03:59,638 --> 00:04:01,708
What's the worst
that could happen to a nose?

67
00:04:01,878 --> 00:04:03,709
What does it get, stuffed?

68
00:04:04,758 --> 00:04:08,228
- He's funny.
- You don't have to tell me.

69
00:04:08,398 --> 00:04:10,229
Ladies, please, please.

70
00:04:10,398 --> 00:04:12,354
Oh, you know what?
He got engaged.

71
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:14,986
Oh, you did?

72
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:17,069
What, is that bad?

73
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:19,706
I actually would have set you up
with a friend of mine.

74
00:04:19,878 --> 00:04:22,312
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

75
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:25,470
You'd be perfect for her.
She loves quirky, funny guys.

76
00:04:26,638 --> 00:04:29,357
- Bald?
- Loves bald.

77
00:04:29,518 --> 00:04:31,349
Loves bald.

78
00:04:32,638 --> 00:04:33,832
Who-?

79
00:04:34,198 --> 00:04:36,428
- Who is she?
- Marisa Tomei.

80
00:04:40,118 --> 00:04:42,678
- The actress?
- Yeah.

81
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:44,910
You're friends with Marisa Tomei?

82
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:46,667
That's right.

83
00:04:46,838 --> 00:04:49,352
That's incredible. My Cousin Vinny-

84
00:04:49,518 --> 00:04:51,986
I love her. She was fantastic.

85
00:04:52,598 --> 00:04:53,792
Yeah, I know.

86
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,630
You were gonna fix me up with her?

87
00:04:55,798 --> 00:04:57,231
She's just been sitting home.

88
00:04:57,398 --> 00:04:59,753
Marisa Tomei's sitting home, Elaine.

89
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:02,113
Why didn't you tell me
Katy was friends with Marisa?

90
00:05:02,278 --> 00:05:04,917
Oh, I don't know
what I was thinking.

91
00:05:06,078 --> 00:05:07,477
I want this baby fully loaded.

92
00:05:08,758 --> 00:05:10,316
Well, how soon can you get it there?

93
00:05:10,758 --> 00:05:12,111
Oh, that's terrific.

94
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:14,917
Okay, thanks, bye.
Hey, guess what.

95
00:05:15,078 --> 00:05:18,036
- I just bought my father a Cadillac.
- Really?

96
00:05:18,198 --> 00:05:19,870
- Wow, you are quite the good son.
- Yeah.

97
00:05:20,038 --> 00:05:21,266
I'm a very good boy.

98
00:05:21,438 --> 00:05:23,474
I'm flying down there
and surprising them.

99
00:05:23,638 --> 00:05:26,596
- You gonna sleep on the foldout?
- Yeah.

100
00:05:26,758 --> 00:05:28,157
I guess.

101
00:05:28,318 --> 00:05:30,195
Let me ask you something.

102
00:05:30,758 --> 00:05:32,191
You ever hear of Marisa Tomei?

103
00:05:33,358 --> 00:05:34,427
- The actress?
- Yeah.

104
00:05:34,598 --> 00:05:37,396
- She's- She's something, isn't she?
- Oh, yeah.

105
00:05:37,558 --> 00:05:40,516
- Well, you know Katy, Elaine's friend?
- Yeah.

106
00:05:40,678 --> 00:05:42,509
She happens to be
good friends with her.

107
00:05:42,678 --> 00:05:44,350
Marisa Tomei?

108
00:05:44,518 --> 00:05:47,555
- How does she know Marisa Tomei?
- I don't know. I didn't ask.

109
00:05:47,718 --> 00:05:50,437
You didn't ask
how she knows Marisa Tomei?

110
00:05:50,598 --> 00:05:53,237
- Not the point. Can I finish?
- All right.

111
00:05:53,798 --> 00:05:56,631
Go ahead.
Seems like a reasonable question.

112
00:05:56,798 --> 00:05:59,107
That's all I'm saying.
I would have asked her.

113
00:05:59,278 --> 00:06:00,996
All right!

114
00:06:01,398 --> 00:06:04,435
So she said that she could have
fixed me up with her.

115
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:06,077
What do you mean, "could have"?

116
00:06:06,278 --> 00:06:08,075
Well, you know, if I wasn't engaged.

117
00:06:12,118 --> 00:06:14,109
Could have fixed me up
with Marisa Tomei.

118
00:06:14,278 --> 00:06:15,631
She said I was just her type.

119
00:06:15,798 --> 00:06:17,709
- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah.

120
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:20,676
Do you know the odds
of me being anyone's type?

121
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,271
I have never been anyone's type.

122
00:06:22,438 --> 00:06:26,909
But, apparently, this Marisa Tomei
loves funny, quirky bald men.

123
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:29,674
You know, she won
an Academy Award.

124
00:06:30,358 --> 00:06:32,155
Like I don't know that.

125
00:06:32,318 --> 00:06:34,229
My Cousin Vinny, I loved it.

126
00:06:34,398 --> 00:06:37,913
I, George Costanza, could be
on a date with an Oscar winner.

127
00:06:38,078 --> 00:06:40,467
An Oscar winner, Jerry.
Do you know what that's like?

128
00:06:40,638 --> 00:06:43,357
If 50 years ago someone had fixed
me up with Katharine Hepburn.

129
00:06:43,518 --> 00:06:45,156
Same thing.

130
00:06:45,718 --> 00:06:48,357
Now there's a match,
you and Katharine Hepburn.

131
00:06:48,918 --> 00:06:51,227
- I mean, you've seen her?
- Katharine Hepburn? Yeah.

132
00:06:51,398 --> 00:06:53,389
- Marisa Tomei!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

133
00:06:53,558 --> 00:06:56,118
I mean, she's beautiful, right.
She's just my type.

134
00:06:56,278 --> 00:06:58,269
The dark hair, the full lips.

135
00:06:58,438 --> 00:07:00,269
- You like full lips.
- Oh, I love full lips.

136
00:07:00,438 --> 00:07:03,316
Something you can really
put the lipstick on.

137
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:08,118
Too bad you're engaged.

138
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:12,427
Yeah, too bad, too bad.

139
00:07:13,878 --> 00:07:15,596
This is no good.

140
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:20,237
- Hi.
- Hi.

141
00:07:20,638 --> 00:07:23,106
Excuse me, I'm with Plaza Cable.
I'm sorry to bother you.

142
00:07:23,278 --> 00:07:25,394
I'm looking for the guy
who lives over here.

143
00:07:25,558 --> 00:07:28,311
Been waiting about two hours.

144
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:29,797
You happen to know where he is?

145
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:31,232
No.

146
00:07:31,398 --> 00:07:33,468
Could you tell him
the cable company was here?

147
00:07:33,638 --> 00:07:35,788
- Sure.
- Thank you.

148
00:07:37,878 --> 00:07:39,550
- Nice people.
- Yeah.

149
00:07:40,118 --> 00:07:42,427
Listen, let me ask you a question.

150
00:07:42,718 --> 00:07:44,595
What if I got a cup of coffee
with her?

151
00:07:45,358 --> 00:07:46,757
Well, what about Susan?

152
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:48,510
I can't have a coffee with a person?

153
00:07:48,678 --> 00:07:49,997
I'm not allowed to have coffee?

154
00:07:50,158 --> 00:07:51,432
Would you tell Susan about it?

155
00:07:52,358 --> 00:07:53,837
Not necessarily.

156
00:07:53,998 --> 00:07:56,751
If you can't tell Susan about it,
then there's something wrong.

157
00:07:56,918 --> 00:07:59,148
Of course there's something wrong.

158
00:07:59,318 --> 00:08:00,671
We had a pact.

159
00:08:02,718 --> 00:08:05,073
- Hey, cable guy's looking for you.
- Oh, yeah?

160
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:06,992
Yeah.

161
00:08:07,558 --> 00:08:09,230
Yeah, I've been getting HBO
for free.

162
00:08:09,398 --> 00:08:12,071
They found out about it.
Now they wanna come and take it out.

163
00:08:12,238 --> 00:08:14,832
Well, said he was waiting two hours.
Seemed a little put out.

164
00:08:15,318 --> 00:08:16,797
Oh, was he?

165
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:20,997
Well, I guess the cable man
doesn't like to be kept waiting.

166
00:08:22,318 --> 00:08:23,876
You don't seem too bothered by it.

167
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:26,268
Do you remember what they did to me
10 years ago?

168
00:08:26,438 --> 00:08:28,747
"Oh, we'll be there in the morning
between 9 and 1...

169
00:08:28,918 --> 00:08:32,433
...or we'll be there between 2 and 6."

170
00:08:32,598 --> 00:08:35,635
And I sat there, hour after hour...

171
00:08:36,198 --> 00:08:37,995
...without so much as a phone call.

172
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:40,308
Finally, they show up.

173
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,706
No apology.

174
00:08:41,878 --> 00:08:44,551
Tracking mud all over
my nice, clean floors.

175
00:08:44,718 --> 00:08:48,427
And now they want me
to accommodate them.

176
00:08:48,598 --> 00:08:49,792
Well...

177
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:53,314
...looks like the shoe
is on the other foot, doesn't it?

178
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:57,473
- I've never seen you like this.
- You don't wanna get on my bad side.

179
00:09:00,118 --> 00:09:01,551
- marks without Positraction...

180
00:09:01,718 --> 00:09:05,711
...which was not available
on the '64 Buick Skylark.

181
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,470
Hey.

182
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:09,869
Hey, what are you watching?

183
00:09:10,838 --> 00:09:13,227
What is that, My Cousin Vinny?

184
00:09:13,998 --> 00:09:15,750
- Yeah.
- I thought you saw that before.

185
00:09:15,918 --> 00:09:17,715
How come you're watching
that again?

186
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:20,513
I don't know.

187
00:09:20,678 --> 00:09:23,909
Did you know Marisa Tomei
won an Oscar for that?

188
00:09:24,078 --> 00:09:27,150
Boy, she's beautiful, don't you think?
I wish I looked like that.

189
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:33,030
Turn it off.
You're making me jealous.

190
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,712
I'm gonna think you like her
more than you like me.

191
00:09:45,558 --> 00:09:47,230
- Helo?
- Elaine, it's me, George.

192
00:09:47,398 --> 00:09:49,229
- How come you're whispering?
- Never mind.

193
00:09:49,398 --> 00:09:51,787
Never mind.
I need you to do me a favour.

194
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,347
Remember what we were talking
about at the coffee shop?

195
00:09:54,518 --> 00:09:55,792
No.

196
00:09:56,758 --> 00:09:57,986
Think a second.

197
00:09:58,158 --> 00:10:00,991
You know, your friend was talking
about me and, you know...

198
00:10:01,158 --> 00:10:03,991
George, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

199
00:10:04,158 --> 00:10:06,114
- The actress.
- What?

200
00:10:06,678 --> 00:10:08,350
Marisa Tomei!

201
00:10:08,518 --> 00:10:11,316
- What?
- Nothing. Nothing.

202
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:12,672
Oh, yeah.

203
00:10:12,838 --> 00:10:15,398
- Yeah, what about her?
- Well...

204
00:10:15,558 --> 00:10:17,150
- ... I think I'd like to do it.
- What?

205
00:10:17,318 --> 00:10:18,512
What?

206
00:10:18,678 --> 00:10:20,987
George, no way. You're engaged.

207
00:10:21,158 --> 00:10:22,716
A coffee.
That doesn't mean anything.

208
00:10:23,318 --> 00:10:25,229
- No, George.
- Elaine.

209
00:10:25,398 --> 00:10:27,787
- Forget it.
- Elaine.

210
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:30,028
Elaine! Don't!

211
00:10:31,718 --> 00:10:35,313
The judge! I hate this guy.

212
00:10:38,118 --> 00:10:40,348
I can't believe you're buying
your father a car.

213
00:10:40,518 --> 00:10:42,429
And best of all, it's a Cadillac.

214
00:10:43,798 --> 00:10:45,948
A Cadillac?

215
00:10:47,798 --> 00:10:51,950
I had no idea you had
this kind of money.

216
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:55,796
I don't like to talk about it.

217
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,347
Yeah, I mean,
I thought you were doing okay.

218
00:10:58,518 --> 00:11:02,227
I just didn't think you were
in this kind of, you know...

219
00:11:03,198 --> 00:11:04,916
...position.

220
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,556
It's just money.

221
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:09,715
So when are you getting back
from Florida?

222
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:13,554
Oh, I don't know.
I'll play it by ear. Why?

223
00:11:14,198 --> 00:11:15,392
I don't know, just...

224
00:11:15,558 --> 00:11:18,914
Things seem a little more exciting
when you're around.

225
00:11:20,198 --> 00:11:21,711
That's all.

226
00:11:23,158 --> 00:11:24,671
Are you okay?

227
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:27,557
Sure, sure.

228
00:11:27,718 --> 00:11:29,151
- What was that?
- Quiet, quiet.

229
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,872
Hey, you know the guy
who lives here?

230
00:11:34,038 --> 00:11:36,506
- Yeah.
- All morning I've been waiting here.

231
00:11:36,678 --> 00:11:39,146
- All morning.
- Oh, this is...

232
00:11:40,438 --> 00:11:44,113
The guy says he's gonna be home.
I show up, and all I do is wait.

233
00:11:46,758 --> 00:11:48,988
I'm getting pretty sick and tired of it.

234
00:11:49,158 --> 00:11:50,955
I'm not gonna put up with it
much longer.

235
00:11:51,118 --> 00:11:53,234
I'm loving this.

236
00:11:56,398 --> 00:11:57,877
Hey, there's a guy out here that-

237
00:11:58,038 --> 00:11:59,630
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know, I know.

238
00:12:01,478 --> 00:12:04,117
Thanks very much for yesterday,
by the way.

239
00:12:04,278 --> 00:12:07,156
Jerry, he wants me to fix him up
with Marisa Tomei.

240
00:12:07,318 --> 00:12:09,149
I am not gonna be a part of this.

241
00:12:09,318 --> 00:12:12,230
"Fixed up"? A cup of coffee.
A cup of coffee is not a fix-up.

242
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,071
You wanna meet her.
You wanna see if she likes you?

243
00:12:15,238 --> 00:12:17,877
- So what? So what if I do?
- You're engaged!

244
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:20,427
I'm aware! I'm aware!

245
00:12:20,598 --> 00:12:23,590
But this is Marisa Tomei, Elaine.
An Oscar winner.

246
00:12:23,758 --> 00:12:25,350
How can I live the rest of my life...

247
00:12:25,518 --> 00:12:27,156
...knowing I could have been
with her?

248
00:12:27,318 --> 00:12:28,592
She said I was just her type.

249
00:12:28,758 --> 00:12:31,556
She loves short, stocky,
balding funnymen.

250
00:12:32,198 --> 00:12:33,631
I notice you threw "stocky"in.

251
00:12:33,798 --> 00:12:35,231
Yeah, what the hell.

252
00:12:35,398 --> 00:12:37,389
George, it's cheating.

253
00:12:37,558 --> 00:12:40,118
It's not cheating if there's no sex.

254
00:12:40,278 --> 00:12:42,348
Yes, it is. Jerry.

255
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:48,114
Hundred. Hold on a second.

256
00:12:50,158 --> 00:12:52,388
I'm sorry.
I didn't hear what you said.

257
00:12:54,638 --> 00:12:55,787
Elaine, come on.

258
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:58,028
Would you make the call?
Please, make the call.

259
00:12:58,198 --> 00:13:00,029
Yeah. Yeah, fine. I'll call.

260
00:13:02,918 --> 00:13:05,352
- Eight fifty.
- Oh, right.

261
00:13:08,518 --> 00:13:10,270
So...

262
00:13:10,438 --> 00:13:14,033
...how are you getting to the airport?
Do you need a ride, or...?

263
00:13:14,438 --> 00:13:16,998
- Don't be silly. I've arranged a car.
- You sure? You sure?

264
00:13:17,158 --> 00:13:18,910
Because, you know...

265
00:13:21,798 --> 00:13:24,756
- Maybe I'll let you pick me up.
- Okay.

266
00:13:27,118 --> 00:13:28,710
Oh, hi.

267
00:13:28,878 --> 00:13:30,755
Is Katy there?

268
00:13:33,398 --> 00:13:34,592
What?

269
00:13:34,758 --> 00:13:36,589
Oh, really?

270
00:13:36,758 --> 00:13:38,988
Well, could you tell her
Elaine called?

271
00:13:39,158 --> 00:13:40,955
Yeah, thanks.

272
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:44,518
She's in the hospital.
She has an arrhythmia.

273
00:13:45,718 --> 00:13:48,073
What about Marisa Tomei?

274
00:13:56,198 --> 00:13:58,268
Morty, what do you have to open
this box for?

275
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:00,394
There's already
a box of cookies open.

276
00:14:00,558 --> 00:14:01,707
I wanted a Chip Ahoy.

277
00:14:01,878 --> 00:14:03,869
I don't want all these open boxes.

278
00:14:04,038 --> 00:14:05,596
Look, I got a few good years left.

279
00:14:05,758 --> 00:14:08,591
If I want a Chip Ahoy, I'm having it.

280
00:14:09,998 --> 00:14:11,397
Surprise!

281
00:14:11,558 --> 00:14:13,992
- Jerry!
- Oh, my God!

282
00:14:14,158 --> 00:14:16,877
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I'm a good son.

283
00:14:17,038 --> 00:14:18,676
Just like that? No call?

284
00:14:18,838 --> 00:14:20,954
- Just like that.
- Oh, you are really something.

285
00:14:21,118 --> 00:14:22,517
To what do we owe this honour?

286
00:14:22,678 --> 00:14:24,191
You wanna know, come on outside.

287
00:14:24,358 --> 00:14:25,677
Outside? What's going on?

288
00:14:25,838 --> 00:14:28,147
Whenever Jerry comes,
something exciting happens.

289
00:14:28,318 --> 00:14:29,717
Come on, come on.

290
00:14:36,118 --> 00:14:38,507
- Well, what do you think?
- Look at this.

291
00:14:39,158 --> 00:14:40,910
Look at this.

292
00:14:41,078 --> 00:14:42,511
You bought a Cadillac?

293
00:14:42,678 --> 00:14:44,475
I bought it for you. It's yours.

294
00:14:44,638 --> 00:14:46,833
You what?
You bought me a Cadillac?

295
00:14:46,998 --> 00:14:49,068
I bought you a Cadillac.
Here you go.

296
00:14:49,238 --> 00:14:50,671
Are you out of your mind?

297
00:14:50,838 --> 00:14:52,271
- What?
- We can't take this.

298
00:14:52,438 --> 00:14:53,996
You don't want it? Are you kidding?

299
00:14:54,158 --> 00:14:56,626
- He's not buying us a Cadillac.
- What are you, nuts?

300
00:14:56,798 --> 00:14:59,266
This is a very nice gesture, Jerry,
but take it back.

301
00:14:59,438 --> 00:15:00,917
Can you believe this?

302
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:03,956
I'm not letting him buy us a Cadillac.
He hasn't got the money.

303
00:15:04,118 --> 00:15:06,916
- How do you know?
- Oh, get out of here, Mr. Big Shot.

304
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:08,591
Why can't I buy my father a car?

305
00:15:08,758 --> 00:15:10,635
- Your father doesn't need a car.
- Yes, I do.

306
00:15:10,798 --> 00:15:12,390
- Oh, Morty.
- We're keeping it.

307
00:15:12,558 --> 00:15:14,753
Over my dead body.
Give me those. Give me-

308
00:15:14,918 --> 00:15:17,148
Well, this worked out
just as I had hoped.

309
00:15:24,158 --> 00:15:26,353
- Giddyup.
- Yeah, this is Nick Stevens...

310
00:15:26,518 --> 00:15:28,076
...from Plaza Cable.

311
00:15:28,238 --> 00:15:30,354
Wel, I waited al morning again.

312
00:15:30,518 --> 00:15:32,429
You said you were gonna be there
from 9 to 1.

313
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,987
I was there. Where were you?

314
00:15:35,158 --> 00:15:36,432
I got nothing better to do...

315
00:15:36,598 --> 00:15:39,431
...than stand outside al morning
waiting for you to show up?

316
00:15:39,598 --> 00:15:42,032
You're not gonna
get away with this.

317
00:15:42,638 --> 00:15:44,390
Hey, Jerry, look at this.

318
00:15:44,558 --> 00:15:46,947
My seat's got a memory,
in case somebody moves it.

319
00:15:47,118 --> 00:15:48,437
I could be in prison for years.

320
00:15:48,598 --> 00:15:50,634
I come out, my seat goes back
to where I like it.

321
00:15:50,798 --> 00:15:52,277
That's what I was thinking.

322
00:15:52,998 --> 00:15:54,636
Hello, Jerry.

323
00:15:54,798 --> 00:15:56,117
Hiya, Jack.

324
00:15:56,278 --> 00:15:57,677
So...

325
00:15:57,838 --> 00:15:59,157
...how do you like this?

326
00:15:59,318 --> 00:16:01,070
- Whose car?
- It's mine.

327
00:16:01,238 --> 00:16:02,751
- Yours?
- That's right.

328
00:16:02,918 --> 00:16:05,068
- My son bought it for me.
- He what?

329
00:16:05,238 --> 00:16:06,432
My son bought me the car.

330
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:07,792
It's a present.

331
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,188
- You bought it?
- That's right. I bought it.

332
00:16:10,358 --> 00:16:11,586
You ever see one so nice?

333
00:16:11,758 --> 00:16:12,907
Some car.

334
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:15,308
- You wanna take a ride?
- No, thank you.

335
00:16:15,478 --> 00:16:17,355
- Come on, take a ride.
- I don't wanna ride.

336
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,588
- Why not?
- I don't feel like taking a ride.

337
00:16:19,758 --> 00:16:21,077
Do I have to take a ride?

338
00:16:21,238 --> 00:16:22,671
He doesn't wanna take a ride.

339
00:16:22,838 --> 00:16:25,227
What do you think,
I've never ridden in a Cadillac?

340
00:16:25,398 --> 00:16:28,276
Believe me, I have ridden
in a Cadillac hundreds of times.

341
00:16:28,438 --> 00:16:30,190
- Thousands.
- Thousands?

342
00:16:30,358 --> 00:16:33,395
You think you're such a big shot now
because you got a Cadillac?

343
00:16:35,478 --> 00:16:37,673
Did you believe that guy?

344
00:16:39,678 --> 00:16:42,192
Anyway, I was thinking
about what you said...

345
00:16:42,718 --> 00:16:46,506
...about me and Marisa, you know,
the two of us getting together.

346
00:16:46,838 --> 00:16:48,829
And I know that I said
that I was engaged...

347
00:16:48,998 --> 00:16:53,389
...but, you know, it's really just
something you say, you know.

348
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:56,789
It's like going steady, you know.
Going steady, engaged.

349
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,313
It's all just stuff you say.

350
00:17:00,118 --> 00:17:02,678
Anyway, I was watching
My Cousin Vinny...

351
00:17:02,838 --> 00:17:06,626
...on the tape the other day
and I was thinking that...

352
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:10,507
...you know, the two of us
might take a meeting, as they say.

353
00:17:11,638 --> 00:17:13,549
So, what do you think?

354
00:17:14,998 --> 00:17:17,193
Move a pinkie if it's yes.
Can you move a pinkie?

355
00:17:26,038 --> 00:17:28,632
- Hello.
- Hi, Mr. Kramer.

356
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:30,948
This is McNab
down at the phone company.

357
00:17:31,118 --> 00:17:34,349
We got a report
about some trouble on your line.

358
00:17:34,758 --> 00:17:37,067
Well, I haven't had any trouble.

359
00:17:37,238 --> 00:17:40,594
Thing is, we happen to have a man
right in your neighbourhood.

360
00:17:42,518 --> 00:17:46,670
Is that right? Well, I have been having
a little trouble with my call waiting.

361
00:17:46,838 --> 00:17:48,749
We can fix that. We can fix that.

362
00:17:48,918 --> 00:17:50,476
Oh, can you?

363
00:17:50,638 --> 00:17:52,788
Well, that's funny.
Because as it happens...

364
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,835
...I don't have call waiting.

365
00:17:54,998 --> 00:17:58,195
Seems to me that the phone company
would know that.

366
00:17:58,358 --> 00:17:59,837
Oh, right, I'm sorry.

367
00:17:59,998 --> 00:18:03,468
I was looking at the wrong
work order.

368
00:18:03,638 --> 00:18:05,071
Could you hold on for a second?

369
00:18:05,238 --> 00:18:07,957
I've got something on the stove.

370
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:22,354
Hey, McNab!
Chunnel's on HBO tonight!

371
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,986
Why don't you stop by!

372
00:18:29,878 --> 00:18:31,948
All right. Next thing on the agenda:

373
00:18:32,118 --> 00:18:34,632
The restoration of the fence
at the Broward Gate.

374
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:37,870
At the present time,
we are still accepting bids.

375
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:39,869
It's been broken
for six months already.

376
00:18:40,038 --> 00:18:41,232
What the hell are you doing?

377
00:18:41,398 --> 00:18:44,037
Well, I, as your president,
have to find the best price.

378
00:18:44,198 --> 00:18:46,996
And right now, I, for one,
do not think it's cost-feasible.

379
00:18:47,158 --> 00:18:49,672
I'll bet you don't.

380
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:50,907
What's that?

381
00:18:51,078 --> 00:18:54,036
Come on, Morty. The jig is up.

382
00:18:54,198 --> 00:18:55,950
- What are you talking about?
- I'm sorry.

383
00:18:56,118 --> 00:18:59,235
I'm sitting here the whole meeting
holding my tongue.

384
00:18:59,398 --> 00:19:02,834
I know you a long time, Morty,
but I cannot hold it in any longer.

385
00:19:02,998 --> 00:19:05,558
- What's going on, Jack?
- I'll tell you what's going on.

386
00:19:05,718 --> 00:19:09,233
Morty Seinfeld has been
stealing funds from the treasury.

387
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,229
- Stealing?
- What proof do you have?

388
00:19:11,398 --> 00:19:12,751
Proof? You want proof?

389
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:15,273
He's driving around
in a brand-new Cadillac.

390
00:19:15,438 --> 00:19:16,757
What more proof do you want?

391
00:19:16,918 --> 00:19:18,476
My son bought me that car.

392
00:19:18,638 --> 00:19:22,108
Your son? Your son could never
afford that car.

393
00:19:22,278 --> 00:19:25,236
We all saw his act
last year at the playhouse.

394
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,914
He's lucky he can pay his rent.

395
00:19:28,078 --> 00:19:30,751
Jack's right. He stinks.

396
00:19:30,918 --> 00:19:32,112
It's his material.

397
00:19:32,278 --> 00:19:34,667
I tell you, he bought it for me.

398
00:19:34,838 --> 00:19:37,875
- I move for a full investigation.
- I second.

399
00:19:42,678 --> 00:19:44,430
- Impeachment?
- That's right.

400
00:19:44,598 --> 00:19:46,236
Have you ever heard anything
like that?

401
00:19:46,398 --> 00:19:48,912
- Can they do that?
- If they get the votes.

402
00:19:49,078 --> 00:19:51,228
Told you we shouldn't have let him
give us the car.

403
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:54,037
Didn't you tell them I got the bill?
That proves I paid for it.

404
00:19:54,198 --> 00:19:57,349
It doesn't make a difference.
They think we're in cahoots.

405
00:19:58,358 --> 00:20:01,395
You could put a fence around these
condos and call it an insane asylum.

406
00:20:01,558 --> 00:20:03,150
Nobody would know the difference.

407
00:20:03,318 --> 00:20:05,149
No one's ever
been impeached before.

408
00:20:05,318 --> 00:20:08,594
I couldn't live here.
We'd have to move to Boca.

409
00:20:09,478 --> 00:20:10,991
Hello?

410
00:20:11,158 --> 00:20:14,036
- Oh, hi, Evelyn.
- Hello, Jerry.

411
00:20:14,598 --> 00:20:17,396
I just got off the phone
with Sol Brandes.

412
00:20:17,558 --> 00:20:20,914
- What did he say?
- He's voting to impeach.

413
00:20:21,398 --> 00:20:23,389
Not because he thinks
you stole the money...

414
00:20:23,558 --> 00:20:25,708
...but mainly because you never
thanked him...

415
00:20:25,878 --> 00:20:28,915
...for giving you his aisle seat
at Freddy Roman's show.

416
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:31,357
I did so thank him.

417
00:20:31,518 --> 00:20:34,191
No, he never heard you.
I told you he didn't hear you.

418
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,110
He's deaf anyway.

419
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:39,793
Now, my sources tell me...

420
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:42,347
...there's three votes
for impeachment...

421
00:20:42,518 --> 00:20:44,315
...three votes
against impeachment...

422
00:20:44,478 --> 00:20:46,514
...and one undecided.

423
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:48,589
- Who's that?
- Mrs. Choate.

424
00:20:48,758 --> 00:20:50,032
- Who's she?
- Oh, that one?

425
00:20:50,198 --> 00:20:52,428
She's been a member of the board
longer than anybody.

426
00:20:52,598 --> 00:20:53,917
She's very tough to deal with.

427
00:20:54,078 --> 00:20:57,673
Maybe we should have her over
for coffee and explain our side of it.

428
00:20:57,838 --> 00:21:00,272
- That's a good idea.
- Okay.

429
00:21:00,438 --> 00:21:02,474
I'll see you
at the Lichtenbergs' tonight.

430
00:21:02,638 --> 00:21:05,391
- The Lichtenbergs'?
- Yes, they're having a party.

431
00:21:05,558 --> 00:21:07,116
We weren't invited.

432
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:09,391
Well.

433
00:21:09,718 --> 00:21:11,948
Probably they think
you're too good for them.

434
00:21:12,118 --> 00:21:14,678
You know, because of the car.

435
00:21:17,438 --> 00:21:19,952
We're losing all our friends.

436
00:21:24,998 --> 00:21:26,829
- Hello?
- Helo, Mr. Kramer?

437
00:21:26,998 --> 00:21:28,590
This is John Hanaran from Con Ed.

438
00:21:28,758 --> 00:21:31,875
- Oh, it's Hanaran now, is it?
- Yes.

439
00:21:32,038 --> 00:21:34,836
We've had some reports
of power surges in your building.

440
00:21:34,998 --> 00:21:36,750
It seems some jok ers
were up on the roof.

441
00:21:36,918 --> 00:21:38,670
They must have damaged
some of the wires.

442
00:21:38,838 --> 00:21:41,068
Oh, you don't say.

443
00:21:41,238 --> 00:21:43,547
Either way, we need to get
into your apartment...

444
00:21:43,718 --> 00:21:45,231
...and do a safety check.

445
00:21:46,198 --> 00:21:48,393
Oh, you're good.

446
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:51,152
You are really good.

447
00:21:52,118 --> 00:21:53,517
What are you talking about?

448
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:02,107
I guess I should just
go introduce myself, huh?

449
00:22:02,278 --> 00:22:05,156
Hey, what are you watching?

450
00:22:06,918 --> 00:22:08,749
Only You?

451
00:22:09,358 --> 00:22:11,553
That's another Marisa Tomei movie.

452
00:22:11,718 --> 00:22:13,310
And you've seen that one too.

453
00:22:13,478 --> 00:22:15,753
What, do you have a thing for her?

454
00:22:17,078 --> 00:22:20,753
Yeah. Yeah, I have a thing
for Marisa Tomei.

455
00:22:20,918 --> 00:22:24,877
Like she would ever go out
with a short, stocky, bald man.

456
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:26,596
Like that's her type.

457
00:22:26,758 --> 00:22:28,555
She's an Oscar winner.

458
00:22:29,238 --> 00:22:30,990
Besides, I don't even know her.

459
00:22:31,158 --> 00:22:34,036
It's not like anyone's
trying to fix us up.

460
00:22:34,358 --> 00:22:36,747
Who would try and fix me up
with Marisa Tomei?

461
00:22:36,918 --> 00:22:39,227
What are you talking about?

462
00:22:59,398 --> 00:23:02,196
Have I told you
how much I love you today?

463
00:23:03,318 --> 00:23:05,229
Not in the last 15 minutes.

464
00:23:05,798 --> 00:23:07,789
Well, I do love you very much.

465
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:10,028
And I love you, Marisa.

466
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:13,595
Well, then. Come on, get dressed.

467
00:23:13,758 --> 00:23:15,635
We're going to be late
for the premiere.

468
00:23:42,358 --> 00:23:44,428
Stupid foldout.

469
00:23:44,598 --> 00:23:47,749
Why do they put the bar
in the middle of the bed?

470
00:23:58,118 --> 00:24:01,076
- Hello?
- Hi, Jerry.

471
00:24:01,798 --> 00:24:03,834
Elaine? What's going on?

472
00:24:04,918 --> 00:24:08,797
I was thinking. I mean, I'm not really
doing that much this weekend...

473
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:11,313
...and I thought, "Well, what the hell.

474
00:24:11,478 --> 00:24:14,197
Maybe I'll come down there
and hang out a little."

475
00:24:14,358 --> 00:24:16,553
You wanna hang out here...

476
00:24:16,718 --> 00:24:19,391
...at Phase Two
in the Pines of Mar Gables?

477
00:24:24,758 --> 00:24:25,952
Well...

478
00:24:26,118 --> 00:24:28,029
...it's just two hours by plane.

479
00:24:28,198 --> 00:24:30,473
Gee, I don't know what to tell you.

480
00:24:31,158 --> 00:24:32,750
Damn it. I got another call.

481
00:24:32,918 --> 00:24:35,307
Hang on. Don't hang up, Jerry.

482
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:37,712
- Yeah?
- Elaine...

483
00:24:37,878 --> 00:24:39,914
...you have got to get me
Marisa Tomei's number.

484
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:43,753
Okay, George, I'm on the other line.
I promise you, I'll get you her number.

485
00:24:44,758 --> 00:24:47,318
- Yeah.
- Goodbye.

486
00:24:48,758 --> 00:24:50,191
Hi.

487
00:24:50,758 --> 00:24:52,111
Hi.

488
00:24:52,638 --> 00:24:53,832
So, what do you think?

489
00:24:54,718 --> 00:24:56,071
I don't think so.

490
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:59,391
I'll be back on Monday.

491
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:02,835
Well, if you need that ride...

492
00:25:03,318 --> 00:25:04,751
...just give me a call.

493
00:25:04,918 --> 00:25:06,670
I can meet you at the gate, Jerr.

494
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,112
Yeah, yeah. Whatever.

495
00:25:08,278 --> 00:25:10,428
- All right, I'll see you.
- Jerr, Jerry?

496
00:25:10,598 --> 00:25:12,554
- Yeah?
- Bye.

497
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:15,957
Bye.

498
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:20,470
Yeah, sure. No, that's fantastic.

499
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:22,436
I'll- I'll see you then.

500
00:25:22,598 --> 00:25:24,111
Okay.

501
00:25:26,038 --> 00:25:28,074
I just got off the phone
with Marisa Tomei.

502
00:25:28,238 --> 00:25:30,798
I just spoke to Marisa Tomei.

503
00:25:30,958 --> 00:25:32,596
And I wasn't even that nervous.

504
00:25:32,758 --> 00:25:35,113
I can't remember calling
a woman without being nervous.

505
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:38,748
Usually I'm pacing all over the room.
I write down things to say.

506
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:41,913
Okay, well, that's all the time
we have for today.

507
00:25:42,078 --> 00:25:44,592
Why don't we pick up
with this next week?

508
00:25:44,758 --> 00:25:46,510
- Where are you going?
- I got stuff to do.

509
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:48,589
- What? You can't leave yet.
- Why not?

510
00:25:48,758 --> 00:25:51,033
- We have to discuss my alibi.
- Alibi?

511
00:25:51,198 --> 00:25:53,587
- What does that have to do with me?
- I spend Saturday...

512
00:25:53,758 --> 00:25:55,874
...with Susan. She'll wanna know
what I'm doing.

513
00:25:56,038 --> 00:25:58,029
I can't use Jerry.
He's in Florida.

514
00:25:58,198 --> 00:26:00,837
- So you wanna say you were with me?
- Yes.

515
00:26:01,638 --> 00:26:03,276
Okay, fine. You were with me.

516
00:26:03,438 --> 00:26:05,474
Wait a second. Wait a second.
What were we doing?

517
00:26:05,638 --> 00:26:07,947
Where were we?
Why are we together?

518
00:26:08,278 --> 00:26:10,917
- What is the difference?
- Because if you ever see her...

519
00:26:11,078 --> 00:26:14,195
...and it comes up,
we have to be in sync.

520
00:26:18,758 --> 00:26:20,271
Okay. Now...

521
00:26:21,238 --> 00:26:24,116
Why do I have to see you?

522
00:26:28,358 --> 00:26:30,872
Because I'm going to the dentist...

523
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:32,596
...and I'm afraid...

524
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:34,988
...and I want you to go with me.

525
00:26:35,478 --> 00:26:37,070
That's no good.

526
00:26:37,918 --> 00:26:40,273
Okay, fine.

527
00:26:40,438 --> 00:26:41,587
What?

528
00:26:41,758 --> 00:26:44,272
I don't like the way you
just rejected my suggestion.

529
00:26:44,438 --> 00:26:47,430
Hey, let's not get so defensive here.
This is a give-and-take process.

530
00:26:47,598 --> 00:26:50,032
I thought that
my suggestion was good.

531
00:26:50,198 --> 00:26:52,268
I think you could have
been a little more tactful.

532
00:26:52,438 --> 00:26:55,794
Okay, look, we've never
worked together on a lie.

533
00:26:55,958 --> 00:26:58,756
You don't understand how I work.
I have a certain way of working.

534
00:26:58,918 --> 00:27:01,716
Jerry and I have worked together
a few times. He knows how I work.

535
00:27:01,878 --> 00:27:05,951
Not a personal thing. We're just trying
to come up with the best possible lie.

536
00:27:06,118 --> 00:27:07,631
- That's what this is about.
- Okay.

537
00:27:07,798 --> 00:27:09,151
- Okay. Fine.
- Okay?

538
00:27:09,318 --> 00:27:11,627
- Good.
- Fine, fine, fine.

539
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,550
Okay.

540
00:27:16,078 --> 00:27:17,875
Okay, how about this?

541
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:19,471
- What?
- You are having problems...

542
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:23,472
...with your boyfriend, and I am
meeting you to discuss the situation.

543
00:27:23,638 --> 00:27:24,991
I don't have a boyfriend.

544
00:27:25,238 --> 00:27:27,308
She doesn't know that.
We say that you do.

545
00:27:29,718 --> 00:27:31,595
It's good. Believe me.

546
00:27:31,758 --> 00:27:34,272
I thought my idea was just as good.

547
00:27:34,438 --> 00:27:37,555
- The dentist thing?
- Yeah, right. The dentist thing.

548
00:27:37,718 --> 00:27:40,630
- The dentist thing was not good.
- Okay, all right.

549
00:27:40,798 --> 00:27:42,516
What is his name? Who is he?

550
00:27:43,398 --> 00:27:44,592
Art Vandelay.

551
00:27:45,438 --> 00:27:47,235
Art Vandelay?

552
00:27:47,398 --> 00:27:49,548
- This is my boyfriend?
- That's your boyfriend.

553
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:51,630
What does he do?

554
00:27:51,798 --> 00:27:54,835
- He's an importer.
- Just imports? No exports?

555
00:27:55,958 --> 00:27:57,869
He's an importer-exporter.
Okay?

556
00:27:59,638 --> 00:28:03,108
So I'm dating Art Vandelay.

557
00:28:03,438 --> 00:28:05,235
What is the problem
we're discussing?

558
00:28:06,638 --> 00:28:08,117
Yes, yes.

559
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:14,877
How about this?

560
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:18,348
How about he's thinking
of quitting the exporting...

561
00:28:18,518 --> 00:28:21,351
...and just focusing in
on the importing.

562
00:28:21,518 --> 00:28:25,636
And this is causing a problem.
Because why not do both?

563
00:28:28,718 --> 00:28:31,471
Oh, what? You don't like
that suggestion either?

564
00:28:32,078 --> 00:28:33,989
It's very complicated.

565
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:37,595
You know, it seems to me
that it's all you...

566
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:39,635
...and none of my ideas
are getting in.

567
00:28:39,798 --> 00:28:44,349
You know, I mean, you just know it all.
And I am Miss Stupid, right?

568
00:28:47,998 --> 00:28:49,829
What are you doing?
Are you making coffee?

569
00:28:49,998 --> 00:28:52,273
- Yeah.
- You better make a pot of tea too.

570
00:28:52,438 --> 00:28:53,996
Morty, you're driving me crazy.

571
00:28:54,158 --> 00:28:55,830
Look, I don't want anything
to go wrong.

572
00:28:55,998 --> 00:28:58,512
If this woman votes to impeach me,
I'll be a laughingstock.

573
00:28:58,678 --> 00:29:02,353
You wanna drive a Cadillac,
expect to pay the consequences.

574
00:29:02,518 --> 00:29:04,156
There she is.

575
00:29:06,718 --> 00:29:07,946
Hello. Hello, Mrs. Choate.

576
00:29:08,118 --> 00:29:10,268
- Hello.
- Oh, come in. May I take your coat?

577
00:29:10,438 --> 00:29:13,316
No, no. I prefer to wear it.
Nobody's taking my coat.

578
00:29:13,478 --> 00:29:15,309
How about a cup
of coffee or something?

579
00:29:15,478 --> 00:29:16,752
Coffee?

580
00:29:17,078 --> 00:29:19,546
I'll take hot water
with lemon if you have it.

581
00:29:19,718 --> 00:29:21,231
Please, have a seat.

582
00:29:21,398 --> 00:29:24,470
That's a lovely scarf you're wearing.
Where did you get it?

583
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:26,674
They're a dime a dozen.

584
00:29:26,838 --> 00:29:29,671
Oh, hi, Jerry. Mrs. Choate,
this is my son, Jerry.

585
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:34,037
- Give me that rye.
- Stop it.

586
00:29:34,198 --> 00:29:35,711
Help! Someone help!

587
00:29:35,878 --> 00:29:38,346
- Shut up, you old bag.
- Thief!

588
00:29:38,518 --> 00:29:42,033
Stop him! Stop him,
he's got my rye!

589
00:29:44,598 --> 00:29:47,158
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

590
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:49,548
Jerry lives in New York.
You just came from New York?

591
00:29:49,718 --> 00:29:52,994
Yeah, I was visiting my daughter.
And I'll never go back.

592
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:55,587
The crime there is just terrible.

593
00:29:55,758 --> 00:29:59,148
Do you know I got mugged
for a marble rye right on the street?

594
00:29:59,318 --> 00:30:02,993
Oh, that's terrible. They stole a rye?
Why would they steal a rye?

595
00:30:03,158 --> 00:30:05,877
That's what the city's turning into.
They'll steal anything.

596
00:30:06,038 --> 00:30:07,153
They're like savages.

597
00:30:07,318 --> 00:30:10,515
Yeah, there are some sickos
out there.

598
00:30:10,678 --> 00:30:13,636
You look very familiar.
Have we ever met?

599
00:30:14,478 --> 00:30:16,912
You ever go to Camp Tioga?

600
00:30:17,078 --> 00:30:18,591
Maybe you've seen him
on television.

601
00:30:18,758 --> 00:30:22,034
- Jerry's a comedian.
- No, I don't watch TV.

602
00:30:22,198 --> 00:30:23,950
- It was nice meeting you.
- Jerry, don't go.

603
00:30:24,118 --> 00:30:25,790
No, I think I'll go.

604
00:30:26,998 --> 00:30:29,558
So, Morty, what's this all about?
What do you want?

605
00:30:30,758 --> 00:30:32,589
Hey, where are you going?

606
00:30:32,758 --> 00:30:34,191
Oh, I- I didn't tell you?

607
00:30:34,358 --> 00:30:36,235
I gotta go meet Elaine.

608
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:38,150
Elaine? What for?

609
00:30:38,318 --> 00:30:41,390
I don't know. She's having some
problems with this guy she's seeing.

610
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:43,271
I didn't know
she was dating anyone.

611
00:30:43,438 --> 00:30:46,510
Yeah, yeah. She's seeing
this guy, Art Vandelay.

612
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:49,872
- So, what does he do?
- He's an importer-exporter.

613
00:30:50,038 --> 00:30:51,790
What kind of problems
are they having?

614
00:30:52,078 --> 00:30:54,433
Well, he...

615
00:30:54,838 --> 00:30:58,956
He wants to quit
the exporting and...

616
00:30:59,518 --> 00:31:01,748
...focus just on the importing.

617
00:31:02,918 --> 00:31:05,478
And it's a problem because
she thinks the exporting...

618
00:31:05,638 --> 00:31:08,277
...is as important as the importing.

619
00:31:08,438 --> 00:31:10,508
Are you having
an affair with Elaine?

620
00:31:12,758 --> 00:31:15,033
Right. Come on.

621
00:31:15,198 --> 00:31:19,316
I'm having an affair with Elaine?
If I was having an affair with Elaine...

622
00:31:19,478 --> 00:31:21,389
...I wouldn't tell you
I'm seeing Elaine.

623
00:31:21,558 --> 00:31:23,992
I would make up another person
to tell you I would see...

624
00:31:24,158 --> 00:31:26,513
...and then I would go see Elaine.

625
00:33:03,998 --> 00:33:06,671
I'll get you! I'll get you, Kramer!

626
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,468
You won't get away with this.

627
00:33:13,318 --> 00:33:14,831
All right, are you ready to eat?

628
00:33:15,798 --> 00:33:19,154
Oh, right, let's go. Jerry, let's go.
It's time to eat. We're going to dinner.

629
00:33:20,918 --> 00:33:23,876
- Dinner? Well, what time is it?
- It's 4:30.

630
00:33:24,438 --> 00:33:26,906
Four thirty?
Who eats dinner at 4:30?

631
00:33:27,078 --> 00:33:29,546
By the time we sit down,
it'll be quarter to 5.

632
00:33:29,878 --> 00:33:31,630
I don't understand
why we have to eat now.

633
00:33:31,798 --> 00:33:34,995
We gotta catch the early-bird.
It's only between 4:30 and 6.

634
00:33:35,158 --> 00:33:38,673
Yeah, they give you a tenderloin,
a salad and a baked potato for $4.95.

635
00:33:38,838 --> 00:33:41,147
You know what that
costs you after 6?

636
00:33:41,318 --> 00:33:44,276
Can't we eat at a decent hour?
I'll treat. Okay?

637
00:33:44,438 --> 00:33:45,951
You're not buying us dinner.

638
00:33:46,278 --> 00:33:48,553
I'm not force-feeding
myself a steak at 4:30...

639
00:33:48,718 --> 00:33:51,027
...to save a couple bucks.
I'll tell you that.

640
00:33:52,358 --> 00:33:53,757
All right.

641
00:33:53,918 --> 00:33:55,351
We'll wait.

642
00:33:55,798 --> 00:33:57,390
But it's unheard of.

643
00:34:02,038 --> 00:34:04,347
So anyway, if you think about it...

644
00:34:04,518 --> 00:34:06,395
..."manure"is not really
that bad a word.

645
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:09,356
I mean, it's "newer,"which is good.

646
00:34:09,518 --> 00:34:12,590
And a "ma"in front of it,
which is also good.

647
00:34:12,758 --> 00:34:15,318
"Manure."It's really not that bad.

648
00:34:15,758 --> 00:34:17,908
You're so right.
I never thought of it like that.

649
00:34:18,078 --> 00:34:21,388
"Manure.""Ma"and the "newer."

650
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:23,746
Did you just make that up?

651
00:34:24,358 --> 00:34:25,871
What, you think I'm doing material?

652
00:34:26,038 --> 00:34:27,312
No, no.

653
00:34:27,478 --> 00:34:31,312
It's hard to believe anyone
could be so spontaneously funny.

654
00:34:31,478 --> 00:34:33,548
And I'm a little tired.

655
00:34:34,838 --> 00:34:36,271
So tell me:

656
00:34:36,438 --> 00:34:38,747
How is it that a man like you...

657
00:34:38,918 --> 00:34:42,831
...so bald and so quirky
and funny...?

658
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:45,592
How is it you're not taken?

659
00:34:46,958 --> 00:34:48,755
Well, Marisa...

660
00:34:48,918 --> 00:34:51,068
...you see, the thing is...

661
00:34:53,078 --> 00:34:55,148
...I'm sort of engaged.

662
00:34:57,398 --> 00:34:58,672
What?

663
00:34:58,838 --> 00:35:01,636
I'm, you know, "engaged."

664
00:35:09,238 --> 00:35:13,629
- Hey, look, there's a spot right in front.
- Always, Jerry. Always.

665
00:35:17,678 --> 00:35:19,953
Was that delicious or what?

666
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,676
Where you gonna get
a better meal?

667
00:35:21,838 --> 00:35:23,112
It's better than Danny's.

668
00:35:23,278 --> 00:35:25,234
Danny's? Come on.

669
00:35:25,398 --> 00:35:26,672
- Hello, Jack.
- Doris.

670
00:35:26,838 --> 00:35:28,556
- Hi, Jack. Hi, Doris.
- Jerry.

671
00:35:28,718 --> 00:35:30,549
Hello, Morty.

672
00:35:31,558 --> 00:35:34,197
Well, you missed the early-bird.

673
00:35:34,358 --> 00:35:35,916
Yeah? So?

674
00:35:36,838 --> 00:35:40,353
Must be nice to have
that kind of money.

675
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:42,357
Bernie.

676
00:35:42,518 --> 00:35:44,986
Look who's eating at 6:00.

677
00:35:45,158 --> 00:35:48,275
Your suddenly well-to-do president.

678
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:50,315
Stop it, Jack.

679
00:35:50,478 --> 00:35:53,390
You enjoy your last meal in office.

680
00:35:53,558 --> 00:35:55,310
Tomorrow, when they kick you out...

681
00:35:55,478 --> 00:35:59,391
...you'll have plenty of time
to drive around in your Cadillac.

682
00:35:59,558 --> 00:36:01,514
They're not kicking me out.

683
00:36:01,678 --> 00:36:03,475
You don't have the votes.

684
00:36:03,638 --> 00:36:05,151
That's what you think.

685
00:36:05,318 --> 00:36:07,468
- We'll see.
- Yes, we will.

686
00:36:07,758 --> 00:36:10,192
All right, let's eat already.

687
00:36:17,598 --> 00:36:19,270
- Hi, Susan.
- Hi.

688
00:36:19,438 --> 00:36:23,067
Hi. Come in. Come in.

689
00:36:23,238 --> 00:36:26,275
- Have a seat.
- Elaine, I have to ask you a question.

690
00:36:26,438 --> 00:36:29,077
- Oh, sure.
- Are you having an affair with George?

691
00:36:29,238 --> 00:36:30,830
What?

692
00:36:37,518 --> 00:36:40,271
Don't be ridiculous.

693
00:36:40,438 --> 00:36:42,508
I mean, why would
anyone wanna sleep-?

694
00:36:46,038 --> 00:36:47,949
Well, obviously...

695
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:50,989
You know- Of- Of-

696
00:36:51,158 --> 00:36:53,877
Why would you think I was
having an affair with George?

697
00:36:54,038 --> 00:36:58,350
Oh, because he said that he had to
talk with you earlier about some...

698
00:36:58,518 --> 00:37:00,156
...problem that you were having.

699
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:02,832
Yeah. Yeah, I did have
to talk with him.

700
00:37:02,998 --> 00:37:05,273
I definitely had to talk with him.

701
00:37:05,438 --> 00:37:09,636
I was having a problem
with my boyfriend.

702
00:37:09,798 --> 00:37:12,437
- Art Vandelay?
- Yeah, Art Vandelay.

703
00:37:12,598 --> 00:37:14,987
I'm sorry.
I- I feel like an idiot.

704
00:37:15,158 --> 00:37:16,989
No, no.

705
00:37:17,158 --> 00:37:18,989
That's okay.

706
00:37:19,158 --> 00:37:21,228
- Forget that we ever talked.
- It is so forgotten.

707
00:37:21,398 --> 00:37:22,672
- All right.
- Okay.

708
00:37:22,838 --> 00:37:24,908
Okay. It's no problem.

709
00:37:28,398 --> 00:37:30,673
So was George helpful at all?

710
00:37:30,838 --> 00:37:34,831
Yeah. Oh, yes.
Yes, he was very helpful.

711
00:37:36,478 --> 00:37:39,072
Because Art and I were
getting into this whole thing...

712
00:37:39,238 --> 00:37:41,706
...about his business.

713
00:37:41,878 --> 00:37:44,028
- You know he's an importer-exporter?
- Yeah.

714
00:37:44,198 --> 00:37:47,270
George felt that I was too
adamant in my stand...

715
00:37:47,438 --> 00:37:50,236
...that Art should focus
on the exporting...

716
00:37:50,398 --> 00:37:52,354
...and forget about the importing.

717
00:37:52,518 --> 00:37:55,908
Wait a minute. I thought that Art
wanted to give up the exporting.

718
00:37:56,078 --> 00:37:58,751
- What did I say?
- The importing.

719
00:37:58,918 --> 00:38:00,829
I did?

720
00:38:01,558 --> 00:38:04,595
So, what does he import?

721
00:38:05,878 --> 00:38:07,550
Chips.

722
00:38:08,558 --> 00:38:10,992
- What kind of chips?
- Potato.

723
00:38:11,158 --> 00:38:13,388
- Some corn.
- And what does he export?

724
00:38:14,398 --> 00:38:16,354
Diapers.

725
00:38:16,518 --> 00:38:19,669
- I'm sorry to bother you.
- Oh, no, it's okay.

726
00:38:21,078 --> 00:38:22,670
Okay.

727
00:38:28,318 --> 00:38:29,546
Come on, George, pick up.

728
00:38:29,718 --> 00:38:31,834
Oh, pick up. Oh, pick up.

729
00:38:36,518 --> 00:38:38,110
- Hi.
- Hi. So, George...

730
00:38:38,278 --> 00:38:40,746
...what does Art Vandelay import?

731
00:38:42,198 --> 00:38:45,634
Matches. Really long matches.

732
00:38:52,478 --> 00:38:55,834
There she is. Okay, if I could have
your attention for a minute here.

733
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:59,796
We're calling this emergency meeting
of the board of Phase Two...

734
00:38:59,958 --> 00:39:03,314
...to consider a motion of impeachment
of our president, Morty Seinfeld.

735
00:39:03,958 --> 00:39:05,949
- Nervous, Jack?
- What for?

736
00:39:06,158 --> 00:39:08,353
Because I have the votes.

737
00:39:08,518 --> 00:39:10,793
- Nice to see you, Mrs. Choate.
- Hello, Morty.

738
00:39:11,158 --> 00:39:14,946
Building A, are you for or against
the motion to impeach?

739
00:39:15,118 --> 00:39:18,076
- What does that mean?
- It means if you're for the motion...

740
00:39:18,238 --> 00:39:19,637
...you're against Morty.

741
00:39:19,798 --> 00:39:21,231
So why don't you say that?

742
00:39:21,398 --> 00:39:23,309
Hey. I'm running the meeting.

743
00:39:23,718 --> 00:39:25,549
If you think so.

744
00:39:26,038 --> 00:39:27,915
- Building A.
- For impeachment.

745
00:39:28,078 --> 00:39:30,797
- Building B.
- Against impeachment.

746
00:39:30,958 --> 00:39:33,472
- Building C.
- For impeachment.

747
00:39:33,638 --> 00:39:36,106
- Building D.
- Against impeachment.

748
00:39:36,278 --> 00:39:38,997
I can't believe you got that old bag.

749
00:39:41,718 --> 00:39:43,151
Help! Someone help!

750
00:39:43,318 --> 00:39:44,546
Shut up, you old bag.

751
00:39:45,038 --> 00:39:47,154
Thief! Thief!

752
00:39:47,758 --> 00:39:48,907
It's him.

753
00:39:50,358 --> 00:39:52,076
It's your son.

754
00:39:52,238 --> 00:39:53,717
Now I know where I saw him.

755
00:39:53,878 --> 00:39:55,869
He stole my marble rye.

756
00:39:56,038 --> 00:39:58,506
My son never stole anything.
He's a good boy.

757
00:39:58,678 --> 00:40:00,828
They should lock him up.

758
00:40:01,198 --> 00:40:04,235
Like father, like son.

759
00:40:04,758 --> 00:40:06,589
I change my vote.

760
00:40:06,758 --> 00:40:08,271
I vote to impeach.

761
00:40:08,438 --> 00:40:10,998
Me too. I change my vote.

762
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:13,274
- All those in favour say aye.
- Aye!

763
00:40:13,438 --> 00:40:14,791
All opposed?

764
00:40:14,958 --> 00:40:17,153
The ayes have it.
The motion passes.

765
00:40:17,318 --> 00:40:20,913
Morty Seinfeld, you are officially
dismissed as condo president.

766
00:40:21,078 --> 00:40:22,955
As vice president, Jack Klompus...

767
00:40:23,118 --> 00:40:25,268
...in accordance with
the Phase Two constitution...

768
00:40:25,438 --> 00:40:27,474
...is hereby installed as president.

769
00:40:27,638 --> 00:40:29,390
Hear, hear, Jack.

770
00:40:29,558 --> 00:40:31,753
Good for you, honey.

771
00:40:36,438 --> 00:40:38,429
All right, I know you're in there.

772
00:40:38,598 --> 00:40:40,395
I know you can hear me.

773
00:40:40,558 --> 00:40:42,992
You win, okay? You win.

774
00:40:43,318 --> 00:40:45,513
I can't do it anymore.

775
00:40:46,038 --> 00:40:48,677
What do you want from me,
an apology?

776
00:40:48,838 --> 00:40:50,317
All right.

777
00:40:50,478 --> 00:40:51,911
I'm sorry.

778
00:40:52,078 --> 00:40:55,548
There, I said it.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

779
00:40:55,718 --> 00:40:59,791
I see now how we made you feel
when we made you sit home waiting.

780
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:02,995
I don't know why we do it.
I guess maybe we just kind of enjoy...

781
00:41:03,158 --> 00:41:05,592
...taking advantage of people.

782
00:41:05,798 --> 00:41:08,073
But all that's gonna change.

783
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:11,716
From now on, no more 9 to 12,
no more 1 to 5.

784
00:41:11,878 --> 00:41:14,028
We'll kind of have appointments.

785
00:41:14,198 --> 00:41:16,234
Eleven o'clock is gonna
mean 11:00...

786
00:41:16,398 --> 00:41:20,914
...and if we can't make it,
I'm gonna call you, tell you why.

787
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:24,673
For God's sakes, if a doctor can do it,
why can't we?

788
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,990
Anyway...

789
00:41:29,558 --> 00:41:31,230
...that's it.

790
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:40,467
I'm sorry, bub.

791
00:42:04,758 --> 00:42:06,988
The bags are in the car.
And I guess we'd better go.
