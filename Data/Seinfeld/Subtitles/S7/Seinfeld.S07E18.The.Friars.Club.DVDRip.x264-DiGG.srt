1
00:00:02,627 --> 00:00:04,538
I love when you're in
the middle of a dream...</i>

2
00:00:06,067 --> 00:00:09,616
...and your alarm goes off, you
incorporate the sound into the dream...</i>

3
00:00:09,787 --> 00:00:11,345
...so you can keep sleeping.</i>

4
00:00:11,507 --> 00:00:14,146
And you'll make any adjustment
in the dream to do it.</i>

5
00:00:14,307 --> 00:00:16,775
I was with Marie Antoinette
in a dream last night.</i>

6
00:00:16,947 --> 00:00:19,222
She was on the guillotine,
the blade came down...</i>

7
00:00:19,387 --> 00:00:21,298
...her head fell in the basket,
rolled over...</i>

8
00:00:21,467 --> 00:00:24,903
...and she started singing
Neil Diamond's "Solitary Man."</i>

9
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:29,187
And I thought,
"That is not my alarm going off.

10
00:00:29,347 --> 00:00:31,736
This is actually happening."</i>

11
00:00:35,747 --> 00:00:38,307
It's June! Hey!</i>

12
00:00:38,947 --> 00:00:43,099
It's June! It's June, June, June!</i>

13
00:00:43,587 --> 00:00:46,385
It's June! June! June!</i>

14
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:50,698
It's June!</i>

15
00:00:53,827 --> 00:00:56,785
June! June, baby!</i>

16
00:00:56,947 --> 00:00:58,938
- What?
- The catering hall screwed up.</i>

17
00:00:59,107 --> 00:01:01,177
The wedding is delayed until June.</i>

18
00:01:01,347 --> 00:01:04,544
- It's like a stay of execution.
- Dead man walking.</i>

19
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:07,746
This is my lucky day.

20
00:01:07,907 --> 00:01:09,659
Well, one out of 20,000.
That's not bad.</i>

21
00:01:09,827 --> 00:01:12,705
Yeah. Hey, wait a second.
You know, good news for you too.</i>

22
00:01:12,867 --> 00:01:15,222
Susan's friend, Hallie,
broke up with her boyfriend.</i>

23
00:01:15,387 --> 00:01:16,661
- She did?
- Yeah.</i>

24
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:19,261
- So? Wheels?
- In motion.</i>

25
00:01:19,427 --> 00:01:21,577
- The wheels are in motion.
- Beautiful.</i>

26
00:01:21,747 --> 00:01:23,624
Hey, if this works out, forget about it.</i>

27
00:01:23,787 --> 00:01:26,904
Vacations together, movies together,
dinner together.</i>

28
00:01:27,067 --> 00:01:29,023
It's almost as good
as if I didn't get married.</i>

29
00:01:29,187 --> 00:01:31,417
Set it up. We can have
dinner at the Friars Club.</i>

30
00:01:31,707 --> 00:01:33,538
- The Friars Club?
- I'm thinking of joining.</i>

31
00:01:33,707 --> 00:01:36,380
Pat Cooper said he would
put me up for membership.</i>

32
00:01:36,547 --> 00:01:40,745
Hey. Listen, do me a favor, will you?
I got a hot date tonight with Connie.</i>

33
00:01:40,907 --> 00:01:42,579
Wake me up in 20 minutes,
all right?</i>

34
00:01:42,747 --> 00:01:45,215
- Catnap?
- No, no, no, no. This is evolutionary.</i>

35
00:01:45,387 --> 00:01:48,220
I've been reading this book
on Leonardo da Vinci.</i>

36
00:01:48,387 --> 00:01:50,776
See, that means "from Vinci."
Did you know that?</i>

37
00:01:50,947 --> 00:01:52,141
- Must be some book.
- Yeah.</i>

38
00:01:52,307 --> 00:01:56,095
Well, it turns out that the master slept
only 20 minutes every three hours.</i>

39
00:01:56,267 --> 00:01:58,144
That works to two and a half
extra days...</i>

40
00:01:58,307 --> 00:02:00,218
...that I'm awake per week,
every week.</i>

41
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:06,144
Which means if I live to be 80, I will
have lived the equivalent of 105 years.</i>

42
00:02:06,307 --> 00:02:07,820
Not to mention how much
you'll accomplish.</i>

43
00:02:07,987 --> 00:02:10,296
- I got a lot in the hopper.
- Didn't know you had one.</i>

44
00:02:10,467 --> 00:02:13,345
Oh, I got a hopper. A big hopper.</i>

45
00:02:14,547 --> 00:02:15,741
All right, people...</i>

46
00:02:15,907 --> 00:02:18,944
...I'd like to begin with a hearty
"hail and well met, good fellow"...</i>

47
00:02:19,107 --> 00:02:21,416
...to Bob Grossberg,
joining us from Business Affairs.</i>

48
00:02:21,587 --> 00:02:23,896
Thanks. Hi, everybody.</i>

49
00:02:24,827 --> 00:02:28,137
Bob, we have a little baptism by fire
for you, so to speak.</i>

50
00:02:28,547 --> 00:02:30,424
Poor bastard.

51
00:02:30,587 --> 00:02:32,862
You handle all the fact-checking
and copyediting...</i>

52
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:34,221
...for the new catalog.</i>

53
00:02:34,867 --> 00:02:36,061
Could you repeat that?</i>

54
00:02:37,067 --> 00:02:39,535
Why don't you handle
all the copyediting?</i>

55
00:02:39,707 --> 00:02:42,938
- I'm sorry. What?
- Copyediting.</i>

56
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,305
Never mind.</i>

57
00:02:45,467 --> 00:02:46,695
Elaine, you do it.</i>

58
00:02:53,787 --> 00:02:56,540
Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld. Pat Cooper
made a reservation for me.</i>

59
00:02:56,707 --> 00:02:59,426
Yes, Mr. Seinfeld,
but all gentlemen are required...</i>

60
00:02:59,587 --> 00:03:01,498
...to wear jackets
in the dining room.</i>

61
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:03,225
Oh, I'm sorry.

62
00:03:03,387 --> 00:03:05,696
How embarrassing
this must be for you.</i>

63
00:03:05,867 --> 00:03:07,266
You just bought your own dinner.</i>

64
00:03:08,107 --> 00:03:11,019
- No problem. Please, follow me.
- Excuse me.</i>

65
00:03:11,467 --> 00:03:14,379
Funny. Isn't he funny? Funny guy.</i>

66
00:03:15,067 --> 00:03:16,625
Friars.

67
00:03:17,467 --> 00:03:19,662
Hey, not bad.
I kind of like this little thing here.</i>

68
00:03:19,827 --> 00:03:21,465
- It's nice.
- This way, please.</i>

69
00:03:21,787 --> 00:03:24,460
Here we go. Here we go.</i>

70
00:03:25,907 --> 00:03:27,579
Come on.</i>

71
00:03:27,747 --> 00:03:30,307
I'm telling you, I can coach
in the NFL. It's not that hard.</i>

72
00:03:30,467 --> 00:03:32,662
That might be the stupidest thing
you've ever said.</i>

73
00:03:32,827 --> 00:03:34,055
- Get out of here.
- Come on.</i>

74
00:03:34,227 --> 00:03:37,299
No, the stupidest thing was when you
said Steve Kroft from 60 Minutes...</i>

75
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,866
...is the guy from Seals & Croft.</i>

76
00:03:39,027 --> 00:03:41,143
Watch the videos.
I'm telling you, look at them.</i>

77
00:03:41,307 --> 00:03:42,456
Oh, come on.</i>

78
00:03:47,507 --> 00:03:49,418
This is nice.</i>

79
00:03:51,107 --> 00:03:53,018
- Morning.
- Morning?

80
00:03:53,187 --> 00:03:55,178
- Yeah, what time is it?
- Ten-thirty.</i>

81
00:03:55,907 --> 00:03:57,898
See, I got the whole night
ahead of me.</i>

82
00:03:58,067 --> 00:04:01,776
- Boy, that's a nice jacket.
- Oh, I don't believe this.</i>

83
00:04:01,947 --> 00:04:04,302
I forgot to give it back.
It belongs to the Friars Club.</i>

84
00:04:04,467 --> 00:04:06,537
Yeah, I like that crest.</i>

85
00:04:06,707 --> 00:04:08,060
All right.

86
00:04:08,227 --> 00:04:09,421
- Breakfast?
- Oh, yeah.</i>

87
00:04:09,587 --> 00:04:11,259
Most important meal of the day.</i>

88
00:04:11,427 --> 00:04:13,895
- This da Vinci sleep is working?
- I'm percolating, Jerry.</i>

89
00:04:14,067 --> 00:04:18,822
I tell you, I have never felt so fertile.
I'm mossy, Jerry. My brain is mossy.</i>

90
00:04:18,987 --> 00:04:20,181
Listen to this idea:</i>

91
00:04:20,347 --> 00:04:22,907
A restaurant that serves
only peanut butter and jelly.</i>

92
00:04:23,307 --> 00:04:25,059
- What do you call it?
- PB and J's.

93
00:04:25,227 --> 00:04:28,185
- What do you think?
- I think you need more sleep.</i>

94
00:04:28,347 --> 00:04:30,178
So how'd your date
work out with Connie?</i>

95
00:04:30,347 --> 00:04:32,702
I am telling you,
this woman is strange.</i>

96
00:04:32,867 --> 00:04:34,539
She never wants to leave
the apartment.</i>

97
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:36,698
It's like she doesn't wanna
be seen with me.</i>

98
00:04:36,867 --> 00:04:38,380
- Now you're being ridiculous.
- Yeah.</i>

99
00:04:38,547 --> 00:04:41,619
- No milk?
- Oh, I'll be back.</i>

100
00:04:56,947 --> 00:04:58,699
Jerry?</i>

101
00:04:59,947 --> 00:05:00,936
Hey, Jerry.</i>

102
00:05:02,547 --> 00:05:03,980
Come on, buddy.</i>

103
00:05:04,147 --> 00:05:05,136
Kramer.</i>

104
00:05:05,307 --> 00:05:07,741
- Are you awake?
- Why? What time is it?</i>

105
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:09,545
- It's 4.
- Four in the morning?</i>

106
00:05:09,707 --> 00:05:10,901
Yeah.</i>

107
00:05:11,067 --> 00:05:13,376
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm bored.</i>

108
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:16,459
All this free time, I don't know what
to do. You wanna do something?</i>

109
00:05:16,627 --> 00:05:19,016
No. Would you just get out?</i>

110
00:05:19,187 --> 00:05:21,542
- Well, you wanna rent a movie?
- No.</i>

111
00:05:22,707 --> 00:05:24,698
Well, what am I gonna do?</i>

112
00:05:26,307 --> 00:05:27,945
- Ready for lunch?
- I'm stuck here...</i>

113
00:05:28,107 --> 00:05:31,463
...editing the stupid catalog
because of stupid Bob Grossberg.</i>

114
00:05:32,627 --> 00:05:35,539
Listen, there's something
really suspicious about this guy.</i>

115
00:05:35,707 --> 00:05:38,824
Every time Mr. Peterman
tries to assign him any work...</i>

116
00:05:38,987 --> 00:05:41,626
...he says he can't hear.
And it all gets dumped on me.</i>

117
00:05:41,787 --> 00:05:43,425
- You think he's faking?
- I don't know.</i>

118
00:05:43,587 --> 00:05:45,657
I'd like to try that earpiece,
see if it's real.</i>

119
00:05:45,827 --> 00:05:47,385
Hey, Elaine.</i>

120
00:05:47,707 --> 00:05:48,856
Oh, you have a friend.</i>

121
00:05:50,547 --> 00:05:52,026
Just wanted to say hi.</i>

122
00:05:52,187 --> 00:05:54,143
Bob, you know what?

123
00:05:54,307 --> 00:05:57,777
I'm kind of swamped here. Could you
give me a hand with the catalog?</i>

124
00:05:57,947 --> 00:06:01,656
- I'm sorry. What?
- I'm kind of swamped.</i>

125
00:06:02,107 --> 00:06:04,063
Thank you.

126
00:06:04,667 --> 00:06:06,897
I'm having lunch with Mr. P.

127
00:06:07,587 --> 00:06:09,578
I better get going.</i>

128
00:06:11,627 --> 00:06:14,221
Did you see that?
Did you see that, Jerry?</i>

129
00:06:14,387 --> 00:06:15,581
- That was him?
- Yes.</i>

130
00:06:15,747 --> 00:06:19,023
- Somehow I thought he'd be taller.
- All right. Listen.</i>

131
00:06:19,187 --> 00:06:21,542
We'll have to do this some other time.
I got work to do.</i>

132
00:06:21,707 --> 00:06:23,186
- See you later.
- All right.</i>

133
00:06:33,867 --> 00:06:35,585
Hey, Bob.</i>

134
00:06:36,387 --> 00:06:38,139
Bob?

135
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,416
Hey, Bobby, over here.</i>

136
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:43,100
Bob?

137
00:06:43,267 --> 00:06:45,178
Oh, Bob?

138
00:06:45,787 --> 00:06:47,459
Bob?

139
00:06:51,187 --> 00:06:52,745
Hey.</i>

140
00:06:54,867 --> 00:06:56,505
- Elaine.
- Hi.</i>

141
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:58,066
I was just in the bathroom.</i>

142
00:06:58,227 --> 00:07:00,457
Okay, Jerry, please, please.
I'm really busy here.</i>

143
00:07:00,627 --> 00:07:02,379
No, no. I was in the bathroom
with Bob.</i>

144
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:05,141
- So what?
- No, I kind of tried to test his hearing.</i>

145
00:07:05,307 --> 00:07:07,343
Get out! What did you do?</i>

146
00:07:07,507 --> 00:07:10,544
I snuck up behind him at the urinal,
tried to see if he could hear me.</i>

147
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:15,181
- And?
- Well, he flinched sort of.</i>

148
00:07:16,187 --> 00:07:17,939
What do you mean, sort of?
What did he do?</i>

149
00:07:18,107 --> 00:07:20,177
Well, he kind of moved his head,
you know?</i>

150
00:07:20,347 --> 00:07:22,224
But it might have been
on the zip-up.</i>

151
00:07:22,587 --> 00:07:25,181
- So you don't know anything?
- Actually, no.

152
00:07:25,347 --> 00:07:28,020
- All right. Good job.
- Right.

153
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:33,466
Come in.</i>

154
00:07:37,267 --> 00:07:40,179
Last night, huh? Was that something
or was that something?</i>

155
00:07:40,347 --> 00:07:42,383
- That was something.
- She's great, isn't she?</i>

156
00:07:42,547 --> 00:07:44,299
Fantastic. Fantastic woman.

157
00:07:44,467 --> 00:07:46,901
- I told you.
- I'm nuts about her.</i>

158
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:48,625
Do you think she could be an it?</i>

159
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:50,739
- She could be.
- We might have an it!</i>

160
00:07:51,307 --> 00:07:53,423
- "It"written all over her.
- She's got everything.</i>

161
00:07:53,587 --> 00:07:56,055
She's intelligent, smart,
got a great sense of humor.</i>

162
00:07:56,227 --> 00:07:58,787
- I don't know. I didn't really talk to her.
- She's smart.</i>

163
00:07:58,947 --> 00:08:01,336
- You take my word for it.
- Whatever.</i>

164
00:08:01,507 --> 00:08:03,179
We could be like the Gatsbys.</i>

165
00:08:03,347 --> 00:08:05,656
Didn't they always have
a bunch of people around...</i>

166
00:08:05,827 --> 00:08:07,818
...and they were all best friends?</i>

167
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,818
- That doesn't sound right.
- No.</i>

168
00:08:09,987 --> 00:08:12,455
Tonight she's got tickets
for that show she's working on...</i>

169
00:08:12,627 --> 00:08:15,187
- ... The Flying Sandos Brothers.
- Flying Sandos, beautiful.</i>

170
00:08:15,347 --> 00:08:16,541
Great, 7:30, all right?</i>

171
00:08:16,707 --> 00:08:18,379
- Walk me down to the Friars.
- Sure.</i>

172
00:08:18,547 --> 00:08:22,062
So, Jerry, there's an empty apartment
in my building.</i>

173
00:08:22,227 --> 00:08:25,185
If you and Hallie want,
we could try to hold it maybe.</i>

174
00:08:26,107 --> 00:08:27,665
- It's not here.
- What?</i>

175
00:08:27,827 --> 00:08:29,818
The jacket. It's not here.
It's gotta be here.</i>

176
00:08:30,867 --> 00:08:33,017
Oh, boy.

177
00:08:33,187 --> 00:08:35,747
Thanks for that 4 a. m.
wake-up call last night.</i>

178
00:08:35,907 --> 00:08:37,499
Where the hell is that jacket?</i>

179
00:08:38,467 --> 00:08:40,697
- Oh, the one with the crest?
- Yeah.</i>

180
00:08:40,867 --> 00:08:43,700
- That's at the cleaner's.
- The cleaner's? How did it get there?</i>

181
00:08:43,867 --> 00:08:45,346
Well, I borrowed it last night...</i>

182
00:08:45,507 --> 00:08:47,657
- ... and it got a little dirty.
- Great.</i>

183
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:51,900
Somehow I dozed off
and woke up in a pile of garbage.</i>

184
00:08:52,067 --> 00:08:55,662
Somehow? You've had an hour
and 20 minutes sleep in three days.</i>

185
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:59,137
Well, so look, the cleaner's said
you could pick it up tonight at 6.</i>

186
00:08:59,307 --> 00:09:02,140
All right. I just hope I can get it
to the Friars before the show.</i>

187
00:09:02,307 --> 00:09:04,377
Won't be a problem,
don't worry about it.</i>

188
00:09:05,547 --> 00:09:07,265
Hey.</i>

189
00:09:07,827 --> 00:09:10,341
- Hey!
- Watch out, boy.</i>

190
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:16,538
Can you give us a hand
with some of these boxes, Bob?</i>

191
00:09:18,067 --> 00:09:19,739
Bob?

192
00:09:24,867 --> 00:09:27,939
I want you so bad, Bob.

193
00:09:28,107 --> 00:09:31,816
You turn me on so much.</i>

194
00:09:32,667 --> 00:09:35,579
You're so damn sexy.</i>

195
00:09:36,467 --> 00:09:38,776
I'm starting to unbutton.

196
00:09:39,667 --> 00:09:42,625
Anything getting through? Bob?</i>

197
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:49,977
- They perform all over. Europe mostly.
- European tours.</i>

198
00:09:50,147 --> 00:09:51,785
- Sorry. Sorry I'm late.
- Hey, Jerry.</i>

199
00:09:51,947 --> 00:09:54,302
- You're wearing the jacket?
- It wasn't ready on time.</i>

200
00:09:54,467 --> 00:09:57,027
- I have to return it after the show.
- Sure, sure, sure.</i>

201
00:09:57,187 --> 00:09:59,542
How about these seats?
Are these fantastic, huh?</i>

202
00:09:59,707 --> 00:10:00,981
I feel like Lincoln.</i>

203
00:10:01,147 --> 00:10:03,502
Well, let's hope this evening
turns out a little better.</i>

204
00:10:15,267 --> 00:10:18,418
So are you sure you don't
wanna go to the movies?</i>

205
00:10:18,587 --> 00:10:21,181
No, Cosmo. I like
just being here with you.</i>

206
00:10:21,347 --> 00:10:23,178
Well, it's...</i>

207
00:10:23,627 --> 00:10:26,061
It's a bold adventure, huh?</i>

208
00:10:27,107 --> 00:10:30,304
This is risky business, huh?</i>

209
00:10:30,467 --> 00:10:32,059
I'm all atwitter.</i>

210
00:11:07,107 --> 00:11:10,304
How would you kind people like
to lend me a hand with our next trick?</i>

211
00:11:10,467 --> 00:11:13,504
- I don't think so.
- Please, take off your jacket.</i>

212
00:11:13,667 --> 00:11:15,498
- My jacket?
- Yes, the jacket.</i>

213
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:18,386
What do you say,
ladies and gentlemen?</i>

214
00:11:18,547 --> 00:11:19,741
You can't argue with that.</i>

215
00:11:19,907 --> 00:11:20,896
- Come on.
- Do it.</i>

216
00:11:21,067 --> 00:11:23,900
- Come on, Jerry. Do it!
- Give him the jacket. Go ahead.</i>

217
00:11:24,067 --> 00:11:26,183
All right.

218
00:11:29,307 --> 00:11:32,856
And now we say
the magic word:</i>

219
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,585
And we make it disappear.</i>

220
00:11:42,707 --> 00:11:44,937
Oh, Cosmo.

221
00:11:45,107 --> 00:11:46,665
Cosmo.

222
00:11:46,827 --> 00:11:48,704
Oh, Cosmo.

223
00:11:49,707 --> 00:11:51,663
Honey, can you move a little?
This hurts.</i>

224
00:11:52,787 --> 00:11:54,857
Cosmo?

225
00:11:56,187 --> 00:11:57,984
Oh, my God. Cosmo, wake up.</i>

226
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,338
Cosmo?

227
00:12:02,507 --> 00:12:05,817
Oh, my God. He's dead.</i>

228
00:12:05,987 --> 00:12:07,818
He's dead.</i>

229
00:12:15,507 --> 00:12:18,385
Yeah, Tommy, this is Connie.
You gotta help me.</i>

230
00:12:18,547 --> 00:12:21,186
Some guy dropped dead
on top of me.</i>

231
00:12:21,347 --> 00:12:24,976
I can't call the cops
because Joey might find out.</i>

232
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:29,496
I can't. I'm stuck.
You gotta help me.</i>

233
00:12:36,707 --> 00:12:39,904
This is very exciting.
The inner sanctum here.</i>

234
00:12:41,987 --> 00:12:44,421
Hi, I was in the audience earlier.
You threw my jacket.</i>

235
00:12:44,587 --> 00:12:47,226
- I just wanted to pick it up.
- Jacket?</i>

236
00:12:47,387 --> 00:12:49,662
- What jacket?
- I had a jacket with a crest on it.</i>

237
00:12:49,827 --> 00:12:51,818
You came into the audience,
you threw it away.</i>

238
00:12:53,747 --> 00:12:55,100
Are you sure it was me?</i>

239
00:12:55,267 --> 00:12:59,146
- It was you or one of your brothers.
- Well, two of them have left already.</i>

240
00:13:03,947 --> 00:13:05,426
- No.
- It doesn't even belong to me.</i>

241
00:13:05,587 --> 00:13:08,897
- It belongs to the Friars Club.
- Sorry.</i>

242
00:13:09,987 --> 00:13:12,626
- Jerry, I'm sure it'll turn up.
- I'm sure it won't.</i>

243
00:13:12,787 --> 00:13:14,618
Don't worry. I'll get the jacket back.</i>

244
00:13:14,787 --> 00:13:16,903
There you go.
She's gonna get the jacket back.</i>

245
00:13:17,067 --> 00:13:19,058
So let's go get some coffee, huh?</i>

246
00:13:19,467 --> 00:13:22,459
- I'm a little tired. I think I'll go home.
- Oh, that's too bad.</i>

247
00:13:22,627 --> 00:13:23,901
Yeah, we'll do it another time.</i>

248
00:13:24,307 --> 00:13:26,218
George, we'll go.</i>

249
00:13:43,867 --> 00:13:45,937
Broke a shoelace today.</i>

250
00:13:46,107 --> 00:13:47,586
I can get you shoelaces tomorrow.</i>

251
00:13:49,027 --> 00:13:50,426
Okay.

252
00:13:53,187 --> 00:13:55,178
So, what color?

253
00:13:56,347 --> 00:13:57,939
Brown.

254
00:13:59,907 --> 00:14:01,226
Maybe a black.</i>

255
00:14:01,387 --> 00:14:04,902
- More coffee?
- No, check. Please.</i>

256
00:14:15,707 --> 00:14:18,619
That nut is always up to something.</i>

257
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:02,940
Hey! Hey!</i>

258
00:15:05,347 --> 00:15:07,417
Mama!

259
00:15:09,507 --> 00:15:11,304
No!

260
00:15:11,467 --> 00:15:12,866
Help!</i>

261
00:15:13,027 --> 00:15:14,540
Help!</i>

262
00:15:16,347 --> 00:15:21,137
Elaine, I think I've been working you
a little too hard lately.</i>

263
00:15:21,947 --> 00:15:27,419
So I have two tickets for you to The
Flying Sandos Brothers magic show.</i>

264
00:15:27,587 --> 00:15:29,657
It is a real hoot.</i>

265
00:15:29,827 --> 00:15:32,580
- Well, thank you, Mr. Peterman.
- The tickets are for tonight...</i>

266
00:15:32,747 --> 00:15:36,865
...so you and Bob can knock off
a little early so you both can get ready.</i>

267
00:15:37,987 --> 00:15:39,705
Mr. Peterman, you-</i>

268
00:15:39,867 --> 00:15:41,823
There's no need to deny it, Elaine.</i>

269
00:15:41,987 --> 00:15:44,057
I heard every word you said.</i>

270
00:15:44,587 --> 00:15:47,181
And I know you wouldn't be
just having fun with his handicap.</i>

271
00:15:47,627 --> 00:15:51,905
That kind of cruelty
would be grounds for dismissal.</i>

272
00:15:52,347 --> 00:15:54,303
Of course, Mr. Peterman.</i>

273
00:15:54,707 --> 00:15:57,096
Tell him I'll come down
and talk to him. Okay. Bye.</i>

274
00:15:58,307 --> 00:15:59,820
Well, that was the Friars Club.</i>

275
00:15:59,987 --> 00:16:02,785
Think they're gonna let
a jacket stealer join? I don't think so.</i>

276
00:16:02,947 --> 00:16:04,938
They're gonna charge me
$800 for the jacket...</i>

277
00:16:05,107 --> 00:16:06,620
...and I gotta deal with Pat Cooper.</i>

278
00:16:06,787 --> 00:16:08,698
What kind of show
is that Sandos Brothers?</i>

279
00:16:09,107 --> 00:16:12,338
They take your jacket and just
throw it? I never heard of that.</i>

280
00:16:12,507 --> 00:16:14,259
It was a little unusual.</i>

281
00:16:14,427 --> 00:16:17,578
So Susan and I were thinking dinner
at our house Saturday night.</i>

282
00:16:17,747 --> 00:16:20,341
- Just the four of us.
- No, I don't think so.</i>

283
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:23,586
- Why not?
- I don't know. I'm a little turned off.</i>

284
00:16:24,307 --> 00:16:26,218
Come on,
what are you talking about?</i>

285
00:16:26,387 --> 00:16:28,378
I'm... I'm kind of soured.</i>

286
00:16:28,547 --> 00:16:30,026
- You're soured?
- Yeah, I'm soured.</i>

287
00:16:30,187 --> 00:16:32,018
- Don't be soured.
- I'm sorry. I'm soured.</i>

288
00:16:32,187 --> 00:16:33,939
Are you kidding?
We were getting along.</i>

289
00:16:34,107 --> 00:16:35,335
Where is this coming from?</i>

290
00:16:35,507 --> 00:16:38,067
Frankly, I didn't think she was
concerned about my jacket.</i>

291
00:16:38,227 --> 00:16:40,661
What are you talking about?
She's very concerned.</i>

292
00:16:40,827 --> 00:16:43,864
- She said she was gonna get it back.
- Yeah, we'll see.</i>

293
00:16:44,027 --> 00:16:46,541
If she gets it back, then you'll have
no reason to be sour.</i>

294
00:16:46,707 --> 00:16:48,026
You'll de-sour, right?</i>

295
00:16:48,867 --> 00:16:51,097
- I'll try and de-sour.
- That's not good enough.</i>

296
00:16:51,267 --> 00:16:53,656
You don't try and de-sour.
You have to sweeten too.</i>

297
00:16:53,827 --> 00:16:56,466
I'll try. I'll try and de-sour
and sweeten.</i>

298
00:16:57,147 --> 00:16:59,217
I wanna get it back
to when we were the Gatsbys.</i>

299
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,979
- I still don't know what that means.
- Yeah.</i>

300
00:17:04,227 --> 00:17:05,626
God.

301
00:17:05,787 --> 00:17:09,223
- Oh, my God, what happened to you?
- She tried to kill me, Jerry.</i>

302
00:17:09,627 --> 00:17:11,026
- Who?
- Connie!</i>

303
00:17:11,187 --> 00:17:13,462
- What did she do?
- I don't know.</i>

304
00:17:13,627 --> 00:17:16,699
But I woke up
in the Hudson River in a sack!</i>

305
00:17:17,827 --> 00:17:20,944
I think she drugged me. But she's
a murderer, and I'm calling the cops.</i>

306
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:22,460
Why would she try and kill you?</i>

307
00:17:22,627 --> 00:17:26,586
Well, isn't it obvious? She doesn't
want anybody else to have me.</i>

308
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:33,186
- Hey, there's Uncle Miltie.
- Yeah, it is.</i>

309
00:17:33,347 --> 00:17:34,621
And there's David Steinberg.</i>

310
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:37,665
- The comedian or the manager?
- The manager.</i>

311
00:17:38,347 --> 00:17:39,746
Hey, there's Pat. Hey, Pat.</i>

312
00:17:39,907 --> 00:17:42,023
What went wrong?
What's the matter with you?</i>

313
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:45,099
- What, are you a kleptomaniac?
- I forgot to take it off.</i>

314
00:17:45,267 --> 00:17:46,746
You forgot to take it off?</i>

315
00:17:46,907 --> 00:17:50,946
Oh, you go into a department store,
you put a suit on and walk right out.</i>

316
00:17:51,107 --> 00:17:53,143
- What, are you some sort of an idiot?
- I'm sorry.</i>

317
00:17:53,307 --> 00:17:55,537
- Where's the jacket?
- One of the Gypsies took it.</i>

318
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:56,935
Oh, the Gypsies took it.</i>

319
00:17:57,107 --> 00:17:59,018
Of course,
New York has a lot of Gypsies.</i>

320
00:17:59,187 --> 00:18:02,099
- On every block, there's a Gypsy.
- Well, it's true. I saw it.</i>

321
00:18:02,267 --> 00:18:04,656
Excuse me, are you an entertainer?</i>

322
00:18:04,827 --> 00:18:07,261
- Are you in show business?
- No, I-</i>

323
00:18:07,427 --> 00:18:10,419
Then what am I talking to you for?
Bring the jacket back tomorrow.</i>

324
00:18:10,587 --> 00:18:12,179
All right.

325
00:18:14,307 --> 00:18:16,696
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Look at that guy.</i>

326
00:18:16,867 --> 00:18:19,427
Isn't that guy from the show?
He's wearing the jacket.</i>

327
00:18:21,027 --> 00:18:23,746
- Oh, my God. You're right.
- Come on.</i>

328
00:18:23,907 --> 00:18:26,546
Wait a second.
Excuse me, gentlemen.</i>

329
00:18:26,707 --> 00:18:28,663
- Are you members?
- I'm a prospective member.</i>

330
00:18:28,827 --> 00:18:31,057
Until then, that's the way out.</i>

331
00:18:31,227 --> 00:18:32,740
- That guy has my jacket.
- Let's go.</i>

332
00:18:32,907 --> 00:18:35,137
Excuse me. The guy is wearing
a jacket that my-</i>

333
00:18:35,307 --> 00:18:36,296
- Come on.
- Let's go.</i>

334
00:18:36,467 --> 00:18:37,946
- If I could talk to the guy-
- Hey!</i>

335
00:18:38,627 --> 00:18:40,822
These seats are fantastic.</i>

336
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:43,455
It was nice of Mr. Peterman
to give us these tickets.</i>

337
00:18:43,627 --> 00:18:46,221
Yeah. Yeah, it was nice.</i>

338
00:18:47,747 --> 00:18:49,339
Yeah...</i>

339
00:18:50,227 --> 00:18:53,583
...we got our own little private box
here, don't we?</i>

340
00:18:55,907 --> 00:18:57,659
Get off of me. Stop it.</i>

341
00:18:57,827 --> 00:19:00,705
Stop it. Get off of me!</i>

342
00:19:03,947 --> 00:19:08,020
Get ahold of yourself!
Bob, get ahold of yourself!</i>

343
00:19:19,307 --> 00:19:21,298
I don't know how that guy
gave us the slip.</i>

344
00:19:21,467 --> 00:19:22,786
He probably went out the back.</i>

345
00:19:25,627 --> 00:19:27,424
Hey, it's you.</i>

346
00:19:27,587 --> 00:19:30,545
- That's my Friars Club jacket.
- No, it is not. This is my jacket.</i>

347
00:19:30,707 --> 00:19:33,904
No, no, that's my jacket. Give it back.
Come on. I need this jacket.</i>

348
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:37,021
I wanna join.
I need it to become a member.</i>

349
00:19:37,187 --> 00:19:38,540
Help! Help!</i>

350
00:19:40,427 --> 00:19:42,383
What is he yelling about?
They're stealing.</i>

351
00:19:42,547 --> 00:19:44,219
I can't believe it.</i>

352
00:19:44,387 --> 00:19:46,457
- Hey, George, you know what?
- What?</i>

353
00:19:46,627 --> 00:19:49,095
I think this crest is different.</i>

354
00:19:49,387 --> 00:19:51,264
It's got a moose on it.</i>

355
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:54,900
- Moose?
- Yeah.</i>

356
00:19:55,267 --> 00:19:58,464
- I don't think this is the jacket.
- No, it's not.</i>

357
00:20:00,947 --> 00:20:02,141
This is the jacket.</i>

358
00:20:04,227 --> 00:20:08,220
She got the jacket back. Thank you.</i>

359
00:20:08,387 --> 00:20:11,902
It got dirty, so they wanted to clean it
before they gave it back to you.</i>

360
00:20:12,067 --> 00:20:13,785
- That's nice of them.
- That is nice.</i>

361
00:20:13,947 --> 00:20:15,824
- This is nice.
- Yeah.</i>

362
00:20:15,987 --> 00:20:18,740
Let's call Susan.
We'll go have coffee.</i>

363
00:20:19,347 --> 00:20:21,303
I'll see you at the wedding.</i>

364
00:20:41,587 --> 00:20:43,339
Great. Now she's sour.</i>

365
00:20:43,507 --> 00:20:45,975
- Maybe she'll sweeten.
- She won't sweeten. And I'm bitter.</i>

366
00:20:46,587 --> 00:20:48,339
There they are!</i>

367
00:20:48,507 --> 00:20:50,463
Here. Here, we'll leave it
there for you.</i>

368
00:21:12,307 --> 00:21:13,501
That's her, officer.</i>

369
00:21:13,667 --> 00:21:15,385
Kramer. Oh, my God.
I thought you were-</i>

370
00:21:15,547 --> 00:21:18,220
What, sleeping with the fishes?
I guess I woke up.</i>

371
00:21:18,387 --> 00:21:21,424
You're under arrest for the
attempted murder of Cosmo Kramer.</i>

372
00:21:21,587 --> 00:21:23,543
- I didn't do anything.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.</i>

373
00:21:23,707 --> 00:21:26,744
- Get your coat. We gotta take you in.
- Can I call my lawyer?</i>

374
00:21:26,907 --> 00:21:28,784
Okay. Go ahead.</i>

375
00:21:32,547 --> 00:21:35,903
Meet me at the police station. They're
arresting me for attempted murder.</i>

376
00:21:36,067 --> 00:21:39,104
- Attempted murder? Of who?
- This guy, Kramer.</i>

377
00:21:40,267 --> 00:21:42,542
- Cosmo Kramer?
- Yeah, that's right.</i>

378
00:21:42,707 --> 00:21:45,016
I don't want nothing to do with it.
