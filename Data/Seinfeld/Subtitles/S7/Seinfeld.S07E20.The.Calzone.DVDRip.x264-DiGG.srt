1
00:00:04,287 --> 00:00:07,359
Have you noticed that every place
has that tip jar on the counter?</i>

2
00:00:07,527 --> 00:00:09,995
What is the service that
this tip is for, anyway?</i>

3
00:00:10,167 --> 00:00:13,523
I mean, isn't the man basically
just turning around?</i>

4
00:00:13,687 --> 00:00:15,598
Isn't that really all it is?

5
00:00:15,767 --> 00:00:20,238
I think we're tipping people now just
for the absence of outright hostility.</i>

6
00:00:20,767 --> 00:00:22,803
"Thanks very much,
and here's something extra...

7
00:00:22,967 --> 00:00:24,161
...for not taking my head...

8
00:00:24,327 --> 00:00:26,682
...and smashing my face
through the glass countertop.</i>

9
00:00:26,847 --> 00:00:29,361
Really good service here."</i>

10
00:00:33,607 --> 00:00:37,441
Well, currently the doors on the
bathroom stalls here at the stadium...</i>

11
00:00:37,607 --> 00:00:39,837
...don't offer much by way of privacy.</i>

12
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:43,124
I was thinking, if we extend the doors
all the way down to the floor...</i>

13
00:00:43,287 --> 00:00:45,482
Are you out of your mind?
You'd suffocate in there.</i>

14
00:00:45,647 --> 00:00:47,956
You're lucky to have doors.
When I was in the Army...</i>

15
00:00:48,127 --> 00:00:50,641
Costanza, what is that you're eating?
Looks pretty tasty.</i>

16
00:00:50,807 --> 00:00:52,604
- It's a calzone, sir.
- Calzone, huh?</i>

17
00:00:52,767 --> 00:00:54,803
Let's see it. Pass that down.
Let's get a look.</i>

18
00:00:54,967 --> 00:00:56,685
Big Stein wants a little taste.
Come on.</i>

19
00:00:56,847 --> 00:00:58,246
Pass it down. That's a good boy.

20
00:00:58,407 --> 00:01:00,716
Okay, let's...
Hey, what's in this thing?

21
00:01:01,247 --> 00:01:03,124
Cheese, pepperoni, eggplant.</i>

22
00:01:03,287 --> 00:01:04,925
Eggplant, huh?
That's a hell of a thing.

23
00:01:05,087 --> 00:01:06,884
All right. Back to business.
Here you go.</i>

24
00:01:07,047 --> 00:01:08,400
Very good. Very good. Excellent.

25
00:01:08,567 --> 00:01:10,797
Excellent little calzone you got there,
Costanza.</i>

26
00:01:10,967 --> 00:01:13,037
Okay. A little jealous.
All right. Here we go.</i>

27
00:01:13,207 --> 00:01:14,356
Like I told you last week...</i>

28
00:01:14,527 --> 00:01:17,041
...the renovation of the press box
is taking too long.</i>

29
00:01:17,207 --> 00:01:18,720
That eggplant was very good.

30
00:01:18,887 --> 00:01:20,923
Everybody out.
I've got eggplant on my mind.</i>

31
00:01:21,087 --> 00:01:23,282
Costanza, go get me a couple
of calzones right now.</i>

32
00:01:23,447 --> 00:01:24,675
Pronto. Move it out.</i>

33
00:01:24,847 --> 00:01:27,486
Big Stein wants an eggplant calzone.
He must have one.</i>

34
00:01:27,647 --> 00:01:29,365
Everybody out. Hurry up, hurry up.

35
00:01:30,487 --> 00:01:31,761
Who are you having dinner with?</i>

36
00:01:32,127 --> 00:01:35,836
Oh, one of these fabric wholesalers,
this guy Todd Gack.</i>

37
00:01:36,367 --> 00:01:38,323
- I won a bet from him.
- Yeah, what bet?</i>

38
00:01:38,487 --> 00:01:43,766
He bet me that Dustin Hoffman
was in Star Wars.</i>

39
00:01:45,007 --> 00:01:47,202
- Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars?
- Yeah.</i>

40
00:01:47,367 --> 00:01:50,882
Short Jewish guy against Darth Vader?
I don't think so.

41
00:01:51,247 --> 00:01:52,726
Yeah, that's what I said.

42
00:01:52,887 --> 00:01:55,162
So the bet was the loser
has to buy dinner?</i>

43
00:01:55,327 --> 00:01:56,885
Yeah.

44
00:01:58,167 --> 00:02:00,556
- What?
- No, nothing.

45
00:02:04,567 --> 00:02:05,966
- What's with you?
- Feel this.</i>

46
00:02:07,247 --> 00:02:08,760
- Wow, that's hot.
- Yes, piping hot.

47
00:02:08,927 --> 00:02:10,326
It's fresh out of the dryer.</i>

48
00:02:10,807 --> 00:02:12,718
Hey, Elaine, you gotta
feel my pants.</i>

49
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:14,961
I'll see you later.</i>

50
00:02:15,767 --> 00:02:17,917
All right. You don't know
what you're missing.</i>

51
00:02:18,087 --> 00:02:19,281
I'm loving this.

52
00:02:19,607 --> 00:02:21,518
I'll never put on another
piece of clothing...</i>

53
00:02:21,687 --> 00:02:23,359
...unless it's straight from the dryer.</i>

54
00:02:23,527 --> 00:02:26,121
Every time you get dressed,
you'll use the basement dryer?</i>

55
00:02:26,287 --> 00:02:28,960
Oh, yeah. It's a warm
and wonderful feeling, Jerry.

56
00:02:29,127 --> 00:02:31,561
- So, what are you doing later?
- I got a date with Nicki.</i>

57
00:02:31,727 --> 00:02:35,197
- Oh, yeah, she's a beauty.
- Oh, yeah. She's also quite bold.</i>

58
00:02:35,607 --> 00:02:37,837
Bold and beautiful.

59
00:02:38,407 --> 00:02:39,556
This calzone is fantastic.</i>

60
00:02:39,727 --> 00:02:42,116
And look, the pita pocket
prevents it from dripping.</i>

61
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,276
The pita pocket.</i>

62
00:02:45,327 --> 00:02:46,646
Yeah, what is it, Watson?

63
00:02:46,807 --> 00:02:49,196
A lost and found, huh?
No, I don't think we need that.</i>

64
00:02:49,367 --> 00:02:51,517
If people can't hold onto things,
tough luck.

65
00:02:51,687 --> 00:02:53,678
You got a little junk on your lip,
by the way.</i>

66
00:02:53,847 --> 00:02:55,917
You know, a lost and found
could be a good idea.</i>

67
00:02:56,087 --> 00:02:57,281
Hold it, Watson.

68
00:02:57,447 --> 00:02:59,563
- You like the lost and found, George?
- Definitely.</i>

69
00:03:00,207 --> 00:03:01,435
All right. A lost and found.

70
00:03:01,607 --> 00:03:05,077
But there's gotta be a time limit.
We're not running a pawnshop here.</i>

71
00:03:07,927 --> 00:03:10,805
- Hey, Elaine.
- Jerry, hi.</i>

72
00:03:10,967 --> 00:03:12,116
- This is Nicki.
- Hi.

73
00:03:12,287 --> 00:03:14,005
Hello. This is Todd Gack.

74
00:03:14,167 --> 00:03:16,044
Oh, of course, Todd Gack.</i>

75
00:03:16,207 --> 00:03:18,323
Who did you bet was in Star Wars?
Sammy Davis Jr?</i>

76
00:03:21,287 --> 00:03:22,879
So, what movie are you guys
gonna see?</i>

77
00:03:23,047 --> 00:03:24,685
Means to an End.</i>

78
00:03:24,847 --> 00:03:27,202
We were gonna see that too,
but it's sold out.</i>

79
00:03:27,367 --> 00:03:29,676
So we're going to see
Blame It On The Rain.</i>

80
00:03:30,607 --> 00:03:32,802
- Why don't you see what you can do.
- Okay.</i>

81
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:36,241
What 's she gonna do?
They don't have any more tickets.</i>

82
00:03:36,567 --> 00:03:37,716
We'll see.</i>

83
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:39,440
Hey, Jerry, you like cigars?</i>

84
00:03:39,607 --> 00:03:41,837
- Yeah, why?
- I'm going to Montreal tomorrow.

85
00:03:42,007 --> 00:03:43,679
They sell Cubans there dirt cheap.</i>

86
00:03:43,847 --> 00:03:45,678
That's a nice idea
for George's wedding.</i>

87
00:03:45,847 --> 00:03:48,236
- Should I get you a box?
- Lf they're cheap, why not?</i>

88
00:03:48,407 --> 00:03:50,716
All right, I'll buy them
and get them to Elaine.</i>

89
00:03:50,887 --> 00:03:52,081
Okay. Two tickets.

90
00:03:52,247 --> 00:03:53,965
- Means to an End.
- Told you.</i>

91
00:03:54,607 --> 00:03:57,599
- How did you do that?
- I just talked to the manager.</i>

92
00:03:57,847 --> 00:04:02,557
- All right, enjoy Blame It On The Rain.
- Nice meeting you.</i>

93
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:09,486
So they're putting in
a lost and found because of me.</i>

94
00:04:09,647 --> 00:04:12,081
I mean, there's a time limit, but still.</i>

95
00:04:13,047 --> 00:04:16,437
They're really building
a Utopian society up there.</i>

96
00:04:17,287 --> 00:04:19,755
- And you attribute this to the calzone?
- Yeah.</i>

97
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:21,997
I'm like a drug dealer.
I got the guy hooked.</i>

98
00:04:22,167 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm having lunch at his desk every day
this week, just him and me.</i>

99
00:04:25,167 --> 00:04:27,556
He doesn't make a move without me.
It's very exciting.</i>

100
00:04:27,727 --> 00:04:31,606
Boy, with you two guys at the helm,
the last piece of the puzzle is in place.</i>

101
00:04:31,767 --> 00:04:33,041
Yeah.

102
00:04:33,887 --> 00:04:35,957
So let me ask you a question
about the tip cup...</i>

103
00:04:36,127 --> 00:04:39,085
...because I had a little thing with
the calzone guy there this week.</i>

104
00:04:39,767 --> 00:04:41,723
I go to drop a buck in the tip jar...</i>

105
00:04:41,887 --> 00:04:44,924
...and just as I'm about to drop it in,
he looks the other way.</i>

106
00:04:45,087 --> 00:04:47,760
So then, as I'm leaving,
he gives me a look like:

107
00:04:47,927 --> 00:04:49,485
"Thanks for nothing."</i>

108
00:04:49,647 --> 00:04:51,205
- You got no credit.
- Exactly.

109
00:04:51,367 --> 00:04:52,880
It's like I'm throwing a buck away.</i>

110
00:04:53,047 --> 00:04:55,515
I mean, if they don't notice it,
what's the point?</i>

111
00:04:55,887 --> 00:04:59,084
So you don't make a habit of
giving to the blind?</i>

112
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:03,597
Not bills.

113
00:05:05,207 --> 00:05:08,677
Remember I was telling you how Nicki
always gets whatever she wants?</i>

114
00:05:08,847 --> 00:05:10,883
We're at the movies last night,
it's sold out...</i>

115
00:05:11,047 --> 00:05:13,277
...Nicki goes and talks
to the manager... right in.</i>

116
00:05:13,967 --> 00:05:16,527
Beautiful women.
You know, they get away with murder.</i>

117
00:05:16,687 --> 00:05:19,645
You never see one of them
lift anything over three pounds.</i>

118
00:05:19,807 --> 00:05:21,445
They do what they want,
when they want.</i>

119
00:05:21,607 --> 00:05:25,202
- Nobody can stop them.
- She's like a beautiful Godzilla.</i>

120
00:05:25,527 --> 00:05:28,724
And I'm thousands of
fleeing Japanese.</i>

121
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:35,085
Hey.

122
00:05:35,647 --> 00:05:36,875
What the hell is all this?</i>

123
00:05:37,527 --> 00:05:39,119
It's my change.</i>

124
00:05:39,647 --> 00:05:42,002
I need quarters for the dryer.</i>

125
00:05:44,247 --> 00:05:46,556
Why can't you do this on your table?</i>

126
00:05:46,967 --> 00:05:49,037
Because I don't have a table.</i>

127
00:05:51,047 --> 00:05:53,117
- Hey.
- Hey.

128
00:05:53,447 --> 00:05:56,200
Hey, so how was
Blame It On The Rain?</i>

129
00:05:57,007 --> 00:05:58,759
Hey, thanks for getting
us tickets too.

130
00:06:00,607 --> 00:06:03,997
Elaine, let me ask you a question.</i>

131
00:06:04,167 --> 00:06:06,965
Was the movie part of the bet?</i>

132
00:06:07,127 --> 00:06:09,516
No, we were both
in the mood for one.</i>

133
00:06:10,847 --> 00:06:12,565
You know, Elaine...</i>

134
00:06:13,487 --> 00:06:16,877
...it's not my way to intrude on
the personal lives of close friends...</i>

135
00:06:17,047 --> 00:06:18,321
- Oh, is that so?
- Absolutely.

136
00:06:18,487 --> 00:06:21,524
- But I feel I must inform you
that what happened last night...</i>

137
00:06:21,687 --> 00:06:23,279
...was more than a simple bet.</i>

138
00:06:23,447 --> 00:06:25,199
- What are you talking about?
- Come on.</i>

139
00:06:25,367 --> 00:06:26,641
Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars?</i>

140
00:06:26,807 --> 00:06:28,559
He made a bet he knew
he was gonna lose...</i>

141
00:06:28,727 --> 00:06:30,160
...just to take you to dinner.</i>

142
00:06:30,647 --> 00:06:32,126
Oh, that doesn't make any sense.</i>

143
00:06:32,287 --> 00:06:35,085
I mean, if he wanted to ask me out,
why didn't he just ask me?</i>

144
00:06:35,247 --> 00:06:37,397
If he doesn't ask you out,
he doesn't get rejected.</i>

145
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:40,081
He's found a dating loophole.</i>

146
00:06:42,087 --> 00:06:43,281
I don't buy it.

147
00:06:48,087 --> 00:06:49,361
What happened after the movie?</i>

148
00:06:49,967 --> 00:06:51,605
Nothing. He walked me home.</i>

149
00:06:51,767 --> 00:06:53,598
- To the door?
- Yeah.</i>

150
00:06:53,767 --> 00:06:55,883
- That's a date.
- No, it's not.</i>

151
00:06:56,047 --> 00:06:57,366
But I never walk you home.</i>

152
00:06:57,527 --> 00:07:00,087
That's just because
you're a jackass.</i>

153
00:07:01,167 --> 00:07:02,839
I found a quarter. Okay.

154
00:07:03,007 --> 00:07:05,521
- Anybody want their clothes heated up?
- No, no, no, thanks.</i>

155
00:07:08,447 --> 00:07:09,402
How'd you leave it?</i>

156
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,603
I'm supposed to meet him
to pick up your cigars.</i>

157
00:07:12,247 --> 00:07:13,805
That's another loophole.</i>

158
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:16,037
That's two dates
without asking you out.</i>

159
00:07:16,247 --> 00:07:19,284
- You're crazy.
- Crazy like a man.</i>

160
00:07:22,127 --> 00:07:25,199
- Number 49.
- You know, my last name is Costanza.</i>

161
00:07:25,367 --> 00:07:26,356
That's Italian.

162
00:07:26,527 --> 00:07:29,997
So you and I are kind of like
countrymen. Paisanos.</i>

163
00:07:30,167 --> 00:07:31,919
- Six fifty your change.
- Yes.</i>

164
00:07:32,087 --> 00:07:35,363
And I always take care of my paisanos,
so here's a little something...</i>

165
00:07:35,527 --> 00:07:36,801
Antonio!

166
00:07:41,687 --> 00:07:44,076
Hey, hey, you steal my money?

167
00:07:44,247 --> 00:07:46,283
No, you don't understand.
I wasn't taking it out.

168
00:07:46,447 --> 00:07:48,358
I know what you tried to do.
Get out of here.</i>

169
00:07:48,527 --> 00:07:49,846
Don't come back again, ever.</i>

170
00:07:50,007 --> 00:07:52,999
- Or I break your head open like a...!
- Oh, my God.</i>

171
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,399
I got the calzones, Mr. Steinbrenner.</i>

172
00:07:55,567 --> 00:07:57,205
Oh, beautiful. I'm starving, George.</i>

173
00:07:57,367 --> 00:08:00,803
So I thought tomorrow
maybe we'd try a little corned beef.</i>

174
00:08:00,967 --> 00:08:02,798
Corned beef?</i>

175
00:08:02,967 --> 00:08:05,686
I don't think so.
It's a little fatty, don't you think?</i>

176
00:08:05,847 --> 00:08:07,439
- How about Chinese?
- Chinese?</i>

177
00:08:07,607 --> 00:08:10,201
No, too many containers.
Big mess. Big mess, very sloppy.

178
00:08:10,367 --> 00:08:12,961
We're gonna stick with
the calzones from Paisano's.</i>

179
00:08:13,127 --> 00:08:14,162
That's the ticket.</i>

180
00:08:14,607 --> 00:08:17,565
I just thought it'd be nice,
a little variety.</i>

181
00:08:17,727 --> 00:08:19,001
No, no, no.

182
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:21,397
When I find something I like,
I stick with it.</i>

183
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:23,922
From 1973 to 1982,
I ate the exact same lunch every day.</i>

184
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,839
Turkey chilli in a bowl
made out of bread.</i>

185
00:08:26,007 --> 00:08:28,237
Bread bowl. You eat the chilli,
then you eat the bowl.</i>

186
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:30,796
Nothing more satisfying than
looking down after lunch...</i>

187
00:08:30,967 --> 00:08:32,116
...and seeing just a table.</i>

188
00:08:34,487 --> 00:08:35,681
Thanks for dinner.

189
00:08:35,847 --> 00:08:38,805
I had to give you these cigars.
And since we were both hungry...</i>

190
00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:41,765
Hey, Todd,
let me ask you a question.</i>

191
00:08:43,847 --> 00:08:48,079
Was this whole bet thing
just a way of asking me out?</i>

192
00:08:48,247 --> 00:08:54,117
- What?
- I mean, Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars?</i>

193
00:08:54,287 --> 00:08:56,084
Come on.</i>

194
00:08:57,047 --> 00:08:59,845
Elaine, that was a legitimate bet.
I lost, so I bought you dinner.</i>

195
00:09:01,127 --> 00:09:04,164
- All right. Well, good night.
- Yeah.

196
00:09:04,327 --> 00:09:07,524
If you're not doing anything Saturday
night, you wanna meet somewhere?</i>

197
00:09:08,927 --> 00:09:10,326
Now, what is that?

198
00:09:10,487 --> 00:09:11,681
Is that a date?</i>

199
00:09:12,287 --> 00:09:14,517
Why? Why can't two people
just go and do something...

200
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:16,484
...without it being a date?</i>

201
00:09:16,647 --> 00:09:18,285
All right, all right. I'm sorry.

202
00:09:18,447 --> 00:09:20,244
- It's not a date.
- No way.</i>

203
00:09:20,407 --> 00:09:22,921
- So I'll see you Saturday?
- All right.</i>

204
00:09:23,327 --> 00:09:24,885
Pick you up at 8.

205
00:09:36,127 --> 00:09:38,163
Know what the posted speed limit
is on this road?</i>

206
00:09:38,647 --> 00:09:41,525
- Gotta be 55.
- That's right, it is.</i>

207
00:09:41,687 --> 00:09:45,362
- You know how fast you were going?
- A lot faster than that.</i>

208
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:48,082
- Step out of the car, sir.
- Okey- doke.</i>

209
00:09:51,367 --> 00:09:53,119
Can I have your license
and registration?</i>

210
00:09:53,287 --> 00:09:55,198
Absolutely.

211
00:09:55,367 --> 00:09:56,641
- Nicki?
- Yeah?

212
00:09:56,807 --> 00:09:58,763
Would you mind bringing
the registration?</i>

213
00:09:58,927 --> 00:10:00,804
Not at all.

214
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:04,723
I got you on the radar
at 93 miles per hour.</i>

215
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:08,562
Must have been when
I slowed down to take that curve...</i>

216
00:10:08,727 --> 00:10:11,764
...because for a while there,
I was doing well over 100.</i>

217
00:10:12,167 --> 00:10:13,361
Officer.

218
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:15,361
Hi.

219
00:10:15,527 --> 00:10:17,802
Do you really
have to give us a ticket?</i>

220
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:23,364
All right, Nick. Let's hit it.

221
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:29,158
Hey, buddy.

222
00:10:29,327 --> 00:10:32,478
- I'm waiting for my shirt.
- You got your shirt in my oven?

223
00:10:32,647 --> 00:10:34,558
I didn't have enough
quarters for the dryer...</i>

224
00:10:34,727 --> 00:10:36,524
...but this is better
and more convenient.</i>

225
00:10:36,687 --> 00:10:38,962
- Oh, for both of us.
- And I've got a lot more control.</i>

226
00:10:39,127 --> 00:10:42,915
I got a shirt going
for 10 minutes at 325.</i>

227
00:10:43,647 --> 00:10:44,875
What's wrong with your oven?

228
00:10:45,047 --> 00:10:47,117
I'm baking a pie.</i>

229
00:10:50,327 --> 00:10:51,476
- Yeah?
- Yeah.</i>

230
00:10:51,647 --> 00:10:53,046
- Come on up.
- You got cigars?</i>

231
00:10:53,207 --> 00:10:54,845
I got some Cubans
for George's wedding.</i>

232
00:10:55,007 --> 00:10:57,316
It was more than I wanted to spend,
but what the hell.</i>

233
00:10:57,487 --> 00:10:59,239
Oh, baby, yeah.

234
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:02,925
What are these?</i>

235
00:11:03,087 --> 00:11:05,681
"Producto de Peru."</i>

236
00:11:05,847 --> 00:11:08,077
Jerry, you think those are Cubans?</i>

237
00:11:08,247 --> 00:11:09,566
Peru?

238
00:11:09,727 --> 00:11:11,319
I paid 300 bucks for these.</i>

239
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:14,126
I could have got a house in Peru
for 300 bucks.</i>

240
00:11:14,327 --> 00:11:15,919
You got rooked, buddy.

241
00:11:16,087 --> 00:11:17,679
I gotta pay Todd Gack 300 bucks...

242
00:11:17,847 --> 00:11:21,203
...just so he has some excuse to see
Elaine again without asking her out?</i>

243
00:11:21,367 --> 00:11:24,040
That's a nice name, Todd Gack.</i>

244
00:11:24,487 --> 00:11:26,364
What is that, Dutch?

245
00:11:26,527 --> 00:11:29,041
Oh, baby, here we go.</i>

246
00:11:31,767 --> 00:11:33,962
Oh, mama.

247
00:11:37,167 --> 00:11:39,806
Be right back.
Hey, George, hey.</i>

248
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:45,477
Well, this is really bad now.
I really am in a bad situation now.

249
00:11:45,647 --> 00:11:48,115
What's Steinbrenner gonna do
if he doesn't get his calzone?</i>

250
00:11:48,287 --> 00:11:50,482
What's he gonna do?
That's exactly the point.</i>

251
00:11:50,647 --> 00:11:52,478
Nobody knows what this guy
is capable of.</i>

252
00:11:52,647 --> 00:11:55,605
He fires people like
it's a bodily function.</i>

253
00:11:57,447 --> 00:12:00,325
Why don't you get somebody else
from the office to go to Paisano's?</i>

254
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:02,478
Before you know it,
he's having lunch with him.

255
00:12:02,647 --> 00:12:04,399
You know how
interoffice politics work.

256
00:12:04,567 --> 00:12:06,558
No, I never had a job.</i>

257
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:09,122
I decided to go with the brown ones.</i>

258
00:12:11,087 --> 00:12:12,759
What the hell is this?</i>

259
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:15,157
Kramer's cooking up some corduroy.</i>

260
00:12:15,847 --> 00:12:18,441
There's gotta be some way
to get back into Paisano's.</i>

261
00:12:18,607 --> 00:12:21,405
Oh, Paisano's. That's that place
by the stadium, isn't it?</i>

262
00:12:21,927 --> 00:12:24,043
- Yeah, you've heard of it?
- Newman raves about it.</i>

263
00:12:24,207 --> 00:12:26,482
It's on his mail route.
He stops by there every day.</i>

264
00:12:27,407 --> 00:12:28,886
I'll see you guys later.</i>

265
00:12:30,647 --> 00:12:33,286
- What kind of pie you cooking?
- Huckleberry.</i>

266
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:39,360
Well, you certainly are in a bind.</i>

267
00:12:40,407 --> 00:12:42,841
Yeah, and I thought since
you go by there every day...</i>

268
00:12:43,007 --> 00:12:46,158
...maybe we could
help each other out.</i>

269
00:12:47,927 --> 00:12:50,395
Let me be perfectly blunt.</i>

270
00:12:50,567 --> 00:12:53,206
I don't care for you, Costanza.</i>

271
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:56,565
You hang out on the west side
of the building with Seinfeld all day...</i>

272
00:12:56,727 --> 00:12:59,321
...just laughing it up,
wasting your lives.

273
00:12:59,527 --> 00:13:01,882
- You gonna help me or not?
- All right. I'll help you.</i>

274
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:03,560
I will help you...

275
00:13:03,727 --> 00:13:07,686
...but I will expect
something in return.

276
00:13:07,847 --> 00:13:09,485
- What?
- Well, for starters...

277
00:13:09,647 --> 00:13:11,524
...I want a calzone of my own.</i>

278
00:13:12,407 --> 00:13:13,635
All right.

279
00:13:13,807 --> 00:13:16,480
And a slice of pepperoni pizza.</i>

280
00:13:16,647 --> 00:13:18,478
And a large soda.</i>

281
00:13:18,807 --> 00:13:21,685
And three times a week,
I shall require a cannoli.</i>

282
00:13:22,007 --> 00:13:23,565
A bit steep, don't you think?</i>

283
00:13:23,727 --> 00:13:26,605
You know, I hear that
Mr. Steinbrenner can be a bit erratic.</i>

284
00:13:26,767 --> 00:13:28,723
I'd hate to see him
when he's hungry.</i>

285
00:13:28,887 --> 00:13:31,355
- All right! All right!
- Do we have a deal?</i>

286
00:13:31,527 --> 00:13:33,279
Just make sure you get them
to me by 1:00.</i>

287
00:13:33,447 --> 00:13:36,803
- He's regimented about his meals.
- I know exactly how he feels.</i>

288
00:13:36,967 --> 00:13:41,199
Well, nice doing business with you.
Do come again.</i>

289
00:13:52,247 --> 00:13:54,761
- Oh, this is nice.
- Hi.</i>

290
00:13:54,927 --> 00:13:56,724
Gack, party of four.

291
00:13:57,207 --> 00:13:59,198
Party of four? Who are we meeting?</i>

292
00:13:59,367 --> 00:14:01,927
Mom, Dad.

293
00:14:02,127 --> 00:14:04,163
- This is Elaine.
- Hello.</i>

294
00:14:04,967 --> 00:14:07,959
Hello.

295
00:14:12,567 --> 00:14:14,444
It was nice meeting you.</i>

296
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:17,205
Bye, Ma.</i>

297
00:14:17,687 --> 00:14:19,439
She's wonderful.

298
00:14:23,287 --> 00:14:26,199
- What the hell was that?
- What?</i>

299
00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:28,403
Why did you
introduce me to your parents?</i>

300
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:31,161
They're nice people.
I thought you'd like them.</i>

301
00:14:31,327 --> 00:14:35,161
Come on, Todd.
Admit it. This is a date.</i>

302
00:14:35,647 --> 00:14:37,000
Why is this a date?</i>

303
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,761
Saturday night with your parents?

304
00:14:39,927 --> 00:14:43,124
I mean, unless I'm your sister,
this is a date.</i>

305
00:14:43,527 --> 00:14:45,995
I don't understand why
you can't meet someone's parents...</i>

306
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:47,759
...without classifying it as a date.</i>

307
00:14:47,927 --> 00:14:51,283
- Well, if it's not a date, then what is it?
- It's a lovely evening together.</i>

308
00:14:53,047 --> 00:14:54,446
I don't believe this.</i>

309
00:14:54,607 --> 00:14:55,926
I'm gonna get a cab. Join me?</i>

310
00:14:56,087 --> 00:14:57,998
No, that's okay. I'll just walk home.</i>

311
00:14:58,167 --> 00:15:00,681
All right. Well, good night.

312
00:15:01,327 --> 00:15:03,841
Now, what is that?

313
00:15:17,687 --> 00:15:19,166
Hello.

314
00:15:19,687 --> 00:15:21,120
What's this?

315
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:24,882
Well, I was dropping off
the calzone money for the week.</i>

316
00:15:25,447 --> 00:15:27,836
- Shouldn't you be at work by now?
- Work?</i>

317
00:15:28,007 --> 00:15:29,645
It's raining.

318
00:15:30,607 --> 00:15:32,404
So?

319
00:15:32,887 --> 00:15:36,197
I called in sick. I don't work in the rain.</i>

320
00:15:36,607 --> 00:15:38,643
You don't work in the rain?</i>

321
00:15:38,807 --> 00:15:40,126
You're a mailman.</i>

322
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:43,996
Neither rain nor sleet nor...
It's the first one!</i>

323
00:15:44,807 --> 00:15:47,116
I was never that big on creeds.</i>

324
00:15:47,607 --> 00:15:49,916
You're supposed to deliver
my calzones. We had a deal.</i>

325
00:15:50,087 --> 00:15:54,558
I believe the deal was that
I get your calzones on my route.</i>

326
00:15:54,727 --> 00:15:58,686
Well, today I won't be going
on my route, will I?</i>

327
00:15:58,847 --> 00:16:00,326
Perhaps tomorrow.

328
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:03,321
- But I'm paying you.
- Yes, thank you.

329
00:16:06,647 --> 00:16:08,399
Newman!

330
00:16:09,687 --> 00:16:10,802
Peru?

331
00:16:10,967 --> 00:16:12,878
I thought you wanted cigars
from Cuba.</i>

332
00:16:13,047 --> 00:16:14,196
I did.

333
00:16:14,367 --> 00:16:16,437
If these aren't what you wanted,
why pay him?</i>

334
00:16:16,607 --> 00:16:17,801
Well, what could I do?

335
00:16:18,327 --> 00:16:19,919
Unless...

336
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:22,246
...you paid him a visit.

337
00:16:23,247 --> 00:16:24,600
Okay.

338
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:28,720
Kramer?

339
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:31,156
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

340
00:16:31,327 --> 00:16:34,000
I need you to do me a favour.
Get me lunch at Paisano's.</i>

341
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:36,840
- Wait, what happened to Newman?
- He called in sick.</i>

342
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,755
Oh, right. Yeah, it's raining.

343
00:16:40,407 --> 00:16:41,635
Listen, can you do it?

344
00:16:41,807 --> 00:16:44,241
- Well, what time you want it?
- 1:00. You need some money?</i>

345
00:16:44,407 --> 00:16:47,285
No, no, I got eight tons of change.
I gotta unload it.</i>

346
00:16:47,447 --> 00:16:48,960
All right.

347
00:16:57,167 --> 00:16:59,806
Hey, hold that bus!

348
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:02,080
Hey!

349
00:17:10,247 --> 00:17:11,919
Hey, buddy.

350
00:17:12,087 --> 00:17:14,920
- It's really wet out there, huh?
- What can I get you?</i>

351
00:17:15,087 --> 00:17:18,284
- I hear you make a mean "calazon."
- Calzone.</i>

352
00:17:18,447 --> 00:17:20,119
- Yeah, calzone, yeah.
- The best.</i>

353
00:17:20,287 --> 00:17:22,801
All right. Well, lay them on me.
I'll have three of them.</i>

354
00:17:23,247 --> 00:17:25,363
- Three calzone.
- Yeah, yeah.</i>

355
00:17:31,367 --> 00:17:34,677
Boy, that's a... That's a big oven.

356
00:17:40,327 --> 00:17:43,876
Hey, listen, I wonder if
you could do me a favour?</i>

357
00:17:49,407 --> 00:17:51,398
- Hey, Todd.
- Hi, Elaine.</i>

358
00:17:51,567 --> 00:17:53,319
- Hi.
- You know Nicki, right?

359
00:17:53,487 --> 00:17:56,001
- Hi, yeah, sure.
- Wait, Elaine will settle this.</i>

360
00:17:56,167 --> 00:17:59,239
Elaine, what does the M stand for
in Richard M. Nixon?</i>

361
00:17:59,407 --> 00:18:03,036
- Milhous.
- I told you so. He said it was Moe.</i>

362
00:18:04,887 --> 00:18:06,843
You owe me a dinner.</i>

363
00:18:12,687 --> 00:18:15,121
All right. Your order is ready.</i>

364
00:18:15,607 --> 00:18:17,040
Three calzones...</i>

365
00:18:17,807 --> 00:18:20,321
...and one hot shirt and jacket.
- Oh, yeah.</i>

366
00:18:23,087 --> 00:18:25,396
This is all burned up. Look at this.</i>

367
00:18:25,567 --> 00:18:27,922
What the hell do I know about
cooking a shirt?</i>

368
00:18:28,087 --> 00:18:29,600
Seven fifty for calzones.</i>

369
00:18:30,247 --> 00:18:32,124
Burned up. I don't know.</i>

370
00:18:39,767 --> 00:18:42,201
- What the hell is this? Pennies?
- Yeah.</i>

371
00:18:42,367 --> 00:18:44,517
- You're paying in change?
- That's all I got.</i>

372
00:18:44,687 --> 00:18:46,996
No, you've got to have bills,
paper money.</i>

373
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,123
- You can't pay with this.
- That's all I got.

374
00:18:49,287 --> 00:18:51,721
- Then you got no calzones.
- Wait a minute! Wait!</i>

375
00:19:03,647 --> 00:19:05,842
What happened to you?
Where are the calzones?</i>

376
00:19:06,007 --> 00:19:08,726
He wouldn't give them to me
because I wanted to pay in change.</i>

377
00:19:08,887 --> 00:19:12,436
- What the hell happened to your shirt?
- He overcooked it.</i>

378
00:19:13,567 --> 00:19:15,398
It's all ruined.

379
00:19:16,247 --> 00:19:19,284
Your clothes smell
just like Paisano's.</i>

380
00:19:20,207 --> 00:19:23,961
There's another Italian place
on Jerome. Maybe I can fool him.</i>

381
00:19:30,327 --> 00:19:32,283
You want me to say it again?
I'll say it again.</i>

382
00:19:32,447 --> 00:19:35,439
I haven't had a pimple since I was 18.
I don't care if you believe me.</i>

383
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:37,677
And how's this? You're fired.</i>

384
00:19:38,007 --> 00:19:40,567
Okay, you're not.
I'm just a little hungry. I'm sorry.</i>

385
00:19:40,727 --> 00:19:42,479
This Costanza. Where's my calzone?</i>

386
00:19:42,647 --> 00:19:44,080
It's 1: 15. He's late.</i>

387
00:19:45,527 --> 00:19:48,724
Wait a second. I gotta call you back.

388
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:51,117
That smell. I know that smell.

389
00:19:51,287 --> 00:19:53,755
He's in the building.
Costanza is in the building.</i>

390
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:55,280
And he's not in this office.</i>

391
00:19:55,447 --> 00:19:57,563
He's got the calzone! Costanza!</i>

392
00:19:57,727 --> 00:19:59,843
I catch you, I'm killing you,
Costanza!

393
00:20:04,887 --> 00:20:06,115
Stupid cigars.

394
00:20:06,287 --> 00:20:08,323
If I didn't send Nicki
over to Todd with these...</i>

395
00:20:08,487 --> 00:20:10,364
...they never would have
gotten together.</i>

396
00:20:10,527 --> 00:20:11,721
These are terrible.</i>

397
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:14,521
It's like trying to smoke
a chicken bone.</i>

398
00:20:17,487 --> 00:20:20,843
What kind of a name is
Todd Gack anyway?</i>

399
00:20:21,207 --> 00:20:23,198
I think it's Dutch.

400
00:20:27,367 --> 00:20:29,119
I gotta get going.</i>

401
00:20:29,287 --> 00:20:30,640
Where are you going?</i>

402
00:20:30,807 --> 00:20:34,277
I promised Nicki
I'd walk her dog for her.</i>

403
00:20:34,447 --> 00:20:36,563
- But she dumped you.
- I know, I know.</i>

404
00:20:36,727 --> 00:20:39,878
But somehow she explained it to me,
I couldn't say no.</i>

405
00:20:40,047 --> 00:20:42,003
- Smells like a rubber fire.
- What's that?</i>

406
00:20:42,167 --> 00:20:44,397
I said "rubber fire."</i>

407
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,644
Did you end up paying Todd
for these things?</i>

408
00:20:50,807 --> 00:20:52,718
Actually, it's being taken care of
right now.</i>

409
00:20:59,447 --> 00:21:01,199
- Hey, you Gack?
- Yeah.

410
00:21:01,367 --> 00:21:03,358
Yeah, here's your money.

411
00:21:11,927 --> 00:21:13,804
What did he do with it?
It's gotta be here.</i>

412
00:21:13,967 --> 00:21:16,242
I'm not crazy. I can smell it.

413
00:21:18,127 --> 00:21:19,355
These clothes.</i>

414
00:21:19,527 --> 00:21:21,836
Costanza, how come these
clothes smell like calzones?</i>

415
00:21:22,647 --> 00:21:25,161
My friend put them
in the pizza oven.</i>

416
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:27,716
Put them in a pizza oven?
What for?</i>

417
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:29,600
To heat them up.</i>

418
00:21:30,087 --> 00:21:33,397
That is not a bad idea.
What about this?

419
00:21:33,567 --> 00:21:36,035
We'll put all the uniforms in
pizza ovens before the game.</i>

420
00:21:36,207 --> 00:21:38,402
That's fantastic.
Keep those muscles loosey- goosey.</i>

421
00:21:38,567 --> 00:21:40,683
This could be big.
Clean up this mess, will you?</i>

422
00:21:40,847 --> 00:21:42,166
Big Stein's onto something.

423
00:21:42,327 --> 00:21:45,524
I smell a pennant!
