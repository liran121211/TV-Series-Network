1
00:00:04,047 --> 00:00:05,878
Gum is one of the weirdest
human inventions.

2
00:00:06,047 --> 00:00:08,322
It's not a liquid. It's not a solid.
It's not a food.

3
00:00:08,847 --> 00:00:11,281
What is it?
It isn't really anything.

4
00:00:11,447 --> 00:00:15,645
You know, I mean, it's like
a stationary bike for your jaw.

5
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:18,685
Remember when you were in school
and teachers would get riled up...

6
00:00:18,847 --> 00:00:20,200
...if they caught you with gum?

7
00:00:20,367 --> 00:00:22,562
When you're a kid,
you think what's the big deal?

8
00:00:22,727 --> 00:00:24,206
As an adult, I can understand it...

9
00:00:24,367 --> 00:00:28,042
...because when you're chewing gum,
you don't look thrilled with anything.

10
00:00:28,207 --> 00:00:30,596
World War ll, that was
an important historical event?

11
00:00:30,767 --> 00:00:32,166
Yeah, I'm sure.

12
00:00:37,167 --> 00:00:39,203
They landed a man
on the moon in 1969?

13
00:00:39,367 --> 00:00:41,005
Yeah, right.

14
00:00:42,247 --> 00:00:44,283
Yeah, I buy that, teach.

15
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:51,923
Do you think she's happy?

16
00:00:52,447 --> 00:00:53,960
- Who?
- The cashier.

17
00:00:55,327 --> 00:00:57,397
- Ruthie Cohen?
- You know her name?

18
00:00:57,567 --> 00:00:58,556
Sure.

19
00:00:58,727 --> 00:01:01,685
- I don't think I've ever spoken to her.
- Maybe that's why she's happy.

20
00:01:03,247 --> 00:01:06,683
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- What is this?

21
00:01:06,847 --> 00:01:10,965
Well, it's the latest offering
from the Alex Theatre.

22
00:01:11,127 --> 00:01:15,279
- That stinky old movie house?
- Well, you should smell it now.

23
00:01:15,447 --> 00:01:18,041
- We fixed up the place.
- With Spartacus?

24
00:01:18,207 --> 00:01:20,960
Well, it's a rare archival print.

25
00:01:22,447 --> 00:01:26,235
Twelve extra minutes,
full wide-screen Cinemascope.

26
00:01:26,407 --> 00:01:30,480
And if you come to the 1:00 show,
you can hear Jeffrey Haarwood.

27
00:01:30,767 --> 00:01:33,076
- Jeffrey who?
- Haarwood.

28
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:36,160
He was the assistant
wardrobe man on Spartacus.

29
00:01:36,327 --> 00:01:38,841
He has some fascinating insights
into the production.

30
00:01:39,207 --> 00:01:42,597
Why would you spend $7 to see
a movie that I could watch on TV?

31
00:01:42,767 --> 00:01:44,325
Well, why go to a fine restaurant...

32
00:01:44,487 --> 00:01:46,762
...when you can just stick something
in the microwave?

33
00:01:46,927 --> 00:01:51,876
Why go to the park and fly a kite
when you can just pop a pill?

34
00:01:52,687 --> 00:01:55,645
You guys haven't seen Lloyd Braun,
have you? I'm supposed to meet him.

35
00:01:55,807 --> 00:01:57,286
Lloyd Braun? What for?

36
00:01:57,447 --> 00:01:59,881
Well, he's using his connections
in the mayor's office...

37
00:02:00,047 --> 00:02:02,197
...to get the theatre landmark status.

38
00:02:02,367 --> 00:02:04,358
I thought he screwed up
the Dinkins campaign.

39
00:02:04,527 --> 00:02:07,883
Well, he did. After that,
he had a nervous breakdown.

40
00:02:08,047 --> 00:02:10,607
Had to spend a few months
in an institution.

41
00:02:10,807 --> 00:02:13,879
- Really?
- Yeah, but he's doing a lot better now.

42
00:02:14,047 --> 00:02:16,561
- I've taken him under my wing.
- Oh, then I'm not worried.

43
00:02:16,727 --> 00:02:18,558
But he still needs all of our support.

44
00:02:18,807 --> 00:02:21,401
When he gets here,
treat him like he's one of the gang.

45
00:02:21,567 --> 00:02:22,761
Breakdown, huh?

46
00:02:22,927 --> 00:02:24,997
- Hey, Kramer.
- Hey, Lloyd. Hey, buddy.

47
00:02:25,167 --> 00:02:26,964
- How you doing? Hi, Jerry.
- Lloyd.

48
00:02:27,127 --> 00:02:29,482
- George.
- Hello, Lloyd.

49
00:02:29,647 --> 00:02:33,162
- How you doing?
- Well, he's doing fine, George.

50
00:02:33,727 --> 00:02:35,683
- Gum.
- That's an interesting package.

51
00:02:35,847 --> 00:02:37,405
Yeah, it's from China.

52
00:02:37,567 --> 00:02:38,795
Go ahead, try a piece.

53
00:02:38,967 --> 00:02:41,765
Tell me that's not the most
delicious gum you've ever tasted.

54
00:02:41,927 --> 00:02:46,682
Yes, yes, we shall all try a piece
and tell you how delicious it is.

55
00:02:47,087 --> 00:02:49,476
- George.
- I don't chew gum.

56
00:02:50,127 --> 00:02:51,799
It's different. Where did you get it?

57
00:02:51,967 --> 00:02:53,923
A friend of mine in Chinatown
gave it to me.

58
00:02:54,087 --> 00:02:56,442
- I can ask him where he got it.
- No, don't bother.

59
00:02:56,607 --> 00:02:58,086
- It's no problem.
- I don't want it.

60
00:02:58,247 --> 00:03:00,203
Jerry, Lloyd says it's no problem.

61
00:03:00,367 --> 00:03:03,484
He's capable of locating the gum.

62
00:03:04,087 --> 00:03:08,603
- All right.
- Boy, this is- This is delicious.

63
00:03:15,247 --> 00:03:18,045
You know what? I think this Ruthie
Cohen gave me the wrong change.

64
00:03:18,207 --> 00:03:20,721
Didn't I pay with a 20?
I'm sure I paid with a 20.

65
00:03:20,887 --> 00:03:21,876
- Hey.
- Hey.

66
00:03:22,047 --> 00:03:24,766
I think I finally figured out
what the flavour is in this gum.

67
00:03:24,927 --> 00:03:27,077
It's a little lo meiny.

68
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:29,884
- What kind is that?
- It's Chinese gum.

69
00:03:30,047 --> 00:03:33,562
- Lloyd Braun gave it to me.
- Lloyd Braun. How's he doing?

70
00:03:33,727 --> 00:03:36,844
After Dinkins lost the election,
he had a complete nervous breakdown.

71
00:03:37,007 --> 00:03:38,759
They had to lock him up.

72
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,043
That's around the same time
I broke up with Lloyd.

73
00:03:41,207 --> 00:03:44,165
You don't think that I had anything
to do with his breakdown, do you?

74
00:03:44,327 --> 00:03:47,717
I remember, when we parted company,
I was babbling incoherently for months.

75
00:03:47,887 --> 00:03:49,639
Yeah, well, I've got news for you.

76
00:03:49,807 --> 00:03:52,480
While I was growing up
all I heard from my mother was:

77
00:03:52,647 --> 00:03:55,036
"Why can't you be more
like that Lloyd Braun?"

78
00:03:55,207 --> 00:03:57,801
And in the end, Lloyd Braun
became more like you.

79
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,881
- Right, gotta get going.
- Aren't you coming to Spartacus?

80
00:04:01,047 --> 00:04:03,083
I gotta deliver Christmas
presents to my parents.

81
00:04:03,247 --> 00:04:06,717
- I thought they were out of town.
- Why do you think I'm going now?

82
00:04:10,287 --> 00:04:12,482
- Georgie.
- Hey, Mr. Lazzari.

83
00:04:12,647 --> 00:04:14,126
Back in the old neighbourhood, huh?

84
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:16,562
Yeah, yeah, just delivering
some presents to my folks.

85
00:04:16,727 --> 00:04:18,843
Oh, snazzy car.

86
00:04:19,367 --> 00:04:21,801
- LeBaron?
- Yeah, '83.

87
00:04:21,967 --> 00:04:23,559
It used to belong to Jon Voight.

88
00:04:23,727 --> 00:04:26,446
- The actor, right?
- Something like that.

89
00:04:26,607 --> 00:04:28,837
- Mind if I look under the hood?
- No, go ahead, Pop.

90
00:04:29,007 --> 00:04:31,567
- You always knew your cars.
- Yeah.

91
00:04:31,727 --> 00:04:33,843
Oh, Deena, Deena.
Deena, look who's here.

92
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:37,966
- George Costanza, is that you?
- Hey, Deena. Come on, give us a hug.

93
00:04:38,127 --> 00:04:40,846
Oh, my gosh, you look as pretty
as you did back in high school.

94
00:04:41,007 --> 00:04:43,077
Boy, those were some crazy times.

95
00:04:43,247 --> 00:04:47,525
Yeah, yeah. Speaking of crazy,
did you hear about Lloyd Braun?

96
00:04:49,327 --> 00:04:53,479
The Alex was built in 1922, during
the golden age of movie palaces.

97
00:04:53,647 --> 00:05:00,200
Minor restorations in
1941, '47, '52, '58, '63...

98
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:04,201
...and currently to our present
period of time.

99
00:05:04,367 --> 00:05:06,278
- You're really getting into this?
- I am.

100
00:05:06,447 --> 00:05:09,996
The icing on the cake would be
that landmark status from the city.

101
00:05:10,167 --> 00:05:12,681
We're hoping Lloyd Braun
can pull a few strings.

102
00:05:12,847 --> 00:05:14,280
Oh, can on Lloyd really do that?

103
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:18,281
Lloyd Braun can do anything
he puts his mind to. He's fine, Jerry.

104
00:05:18,447 --> 00:05:19,960
You should
say hello to him, Elaine.

105
00:05:20,127 --> 00:05:21,879
What? Lloyd's here?
No, no, I'd rather-

106
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:25,960
- Hi, Elaine.
- Lloyd. Yes, hello.

107
00:05:26,127 --> 00:05:27,162
Did Kramer tell you?

108
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,046
We reserved some special seats
so we can all sit together.

109
00:05:31,767 --> 00:05:37,160
Oh, well, actually, Lloyd, Jerry and I
have to sit in the front row...

110
00:05:37,327 --> 00:05:40,842
...because-
Because he forgot his glasses.

111
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:45,922
So thanks for getting us the-
We'll see you afterwards.

112
00:05:46,087 --> 00:05:47,361
Come on.

113
00:05:48,127 --> 00:05:49,958
That was odd.

114
00:05:50,167 --> 00:05:53,000
Am I crazy
or does Jerry not wear glasses?

115
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:56,204
You're not crazy.
Jerry does wear glasses.

116
00:05:56,367 --> 00:05:58,597
He just forgot them, that's all.

117
00:05:59,807 --> 00:06:01,445
Not crazy.

118
00:06:03,687 --> 00:06:06,884
We're all the way in the front row?
Couldn't we sit in the special seats?

119
00:06:07,047 --> 00:06:10,084
I'm sorry, but I didn't want Lloyd
thinking I was leading him on again.

120
00:06:10,247 --> 00:06:12,920
Seeing him made me feel
very uncomfortable.

121
00:06:17,887 --> 00:06:20,447
No, you don't want
to be uncomfortable.

122
00:06:20,887 --> 00:06:25,085
- Poor Lloyd.
- I know. Completely bonkers.

123
00:06:25,807 --> 00:06:28,640
I'm sorry I can't be so flip
about this kind of thing.

124
00:06:28,807 --> 00:06:30,923
You know, after what
happened to Pop.

125
00:06:32,047 --> 00:06:34,925
Pop? What happened to Pop?

126
00:06:35,087 --> 00:06:36,759
I thought you heard.

127
00:06:36,927 --> 00:06:38,599
He had a nervous breakdown
last year.

128
00:06:38,767 --> 00:06:40,280
That's why I'm taking care of him.

129
00:06:40,447 --> 00:06:42,677
I tell you, they don't build them
like this anymore.

130
00:06:42,847 --> 00:06:46,601
He doesn't have
the auto shop anymore?

131
00:06:46,767 --> 00:06:48,678
It was too much for him.

132
00:06:50,807 --> 00:06:52,001
- I gotta go.
- What?

133
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:54,283
I just remembered
I gotta be someplace.

134
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:56,563
That's enough, Pop.
Put down the wrench, Pop.

135
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:24,044
Pop! Pop!

136
00:07:25,087 --> 00:07:26,122
- Great movie, huh?
- Yeah.

137
00:07:26,287 --> 00:07:29,404
- Sorry you forgot those glasses.
- I don't know what I was thinking.

138
00:07:29,567 --> 00:07:33,321
- How did you like that gum?
- He loved it.

139
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:36,126
Kramer, you know,
there isn't a light in the ladies room.

140
00:07:36,287 --> 00:07:38,278
Yeah, it's being repaired.

141
00:07:39,567 --> 00:07:40,761
Oh, God.

142
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:45,398
- You all right?
- I sat too close to the screen.

143
00:07:46,127 --> 00:07:48,322
I just gotta stretch out
in a hot bath.

144
00:07:48,487 --> 00:07:50,717
It was nice see you again, Lloyd.

145
00:08:01,527 --> 00:08:05,406
Officer. Officer, is there some reason
this man has too be using a hose.

146
00:08:05,607 --> 00:08:07,199
I mean, he's flooding the sidewalk.

147
00:08:07,367 --> 00:08:10,245
It's a waste of water.
Couldn't he just use a broom?

148
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:11,999
Lady, you sold me.

149
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:13,486
Hey, you with the hose.

150
00:08:18,607 --> 00:08:19,801
Here, put these glasses on.

151
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,527
- What's this for?
- Lloyd's gonna be here any minute.

152
00:08:22,687 --> 00:08:25,804
- So what?
- Well, he thinks you wear those.

153
00:08:25,967 --> 00:08:28,527
They're from the lost and found
at the Alex.

154
00:08:28,687 --> 00:08:30,996
This is ridiculous.
I'm not gonna put these on.

155
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:32,395
Oh, okay.

156
00:08:32,567 --> 00:08:35,604
So he'll just think that the two of you
didn't sit with him on purpose.

157
00:08:35,767 --> 00:08:39,077
Oh, yeah, that's very nice.
Very nice.

158
00:08:40,207 --> 00:08:42,880
Excuse me,
I was in here this morning...

159
00:08:43,047 --> 00:08:45,641
...and I believe I paid you
with a 20-dollar bill...

160
00:08:45,807 --> 00:08:48,765
...but you only gave me
change for a 10.

161
00:08:48,927 --> 00:08:51,157
- I don't think so.
- Oh, I think so.

162
00:08:51,327 --> 00:08:52,555
And I can prove it.

163
00:08:52,727 --> 00:08:54,319
You see, I was doodling
on the bill...

164
00:08:54,487 --> 00:08:57,923
...and so if you have a 20 in there
with big lips on it...

165
00:08:58,087 --> 00:08:59,076
...well, that's mine.

166
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,999
Would you mind
opening up the register?

167
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:02,520
Not unless you buy something.

168
00:09:03,527 --> 00:09:06,758
Okay. Fine, I'll buy a pack of gum.

169
00:09:06,927 --> 00:09:08,519
Hey, George.

170
00:09:09,127 --> 00:09:11,561
- Thought you didn't chew gum.
- I don't.

171
00:09:11,727 --> 00:09:13,206
Take a look.

172
00:09:18,927 --> 00:09:20,485
I know I gave it to you.

173
00:09:20,647 --> 00:09:22,558
George, you mind?
I'm kind of in a hurry.

174
00:09:24,967 --> 00:09:28,084
Fine, fine. Excuse me.

175
00:09:28,247 --> 00:09:31,557
Think I'm gonna forget about this?
I haven't forgotten. I don't forget easily.

176
00:09:33,847 --> 00:09:35,963
Hey, Jerry, look who's here.

177
00:09:36,127 --> 00:09:38,436
- Oh, Lloyd.
- Hi, Jerry.

178
00:09:38,607 --> 00:09:41,167
- Got some more of that gum.
- Oh, the gum.

179
00:09:41,607 --> 00:09:44,121
Yeah, let's all enjoy a chew, huh?

180
00:09:44,607 --> 00:09:46,359
- All right.
- Oh, boy.

181
00:09:46,527 --> 00:09:47,516
Sit down.

182
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:50,679
Yeah, now, see, this is what
the holidays are all about.

183
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:53,486
Three buddies sitting around
chewing gum, huh?

184
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:57,320
Yeah.

185
00:09:58,367 --> 00:10:01,120
So, you know, Lloyd,
he thinks he can get more of this.

186
00:10:01,647 --> 00:10:03,558
Well, Lloyd
is a very industrious fellow.

187
00:10:03,727 --> 00:10:07,197
I'm sure he can accomplish anything
he sets his mind to.

188
00:10:07,727 --> 00:10:09,638
Actually, the importer
is right in Chinatown.

189
00:10:09,807 --> 00:10:12,002
I'll introduce you.
You can get it get it whenever.

190
00:10:12,167 --> 00:10:13,919
It's not necessary.

191
00:10:14,087 --> 00:10:16,681
Hey, Jerry, you know,
Lloyd wants to do you a favour.

192
00:10:16,847 --> 00:10:18,599
I know that, Kramer.

193
00:10:18,767 --> 00:10:20,678
- If you don't want to...
- Sure, he wants to.

194
00:10:20,847 --> 00:10:24,283
And it's very kind of you.
Yeah, Jerry, he appreciates it.

195
00:10:24,447 --> 00:10:27,996
- Don't you, Jerry?
- Yes, I do, Kramer.

196
00:10:28,847 --> 00:10:32,283
- So how about that Elaine today?
- Oh, baby.

197
00:10:32,447 --> 00:10:35,007
What is that all about, huh?

198
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:37,806
She was practically undressing
in front of me at the theatre.

199
00:10:37,967 --> 00:10:41,960
- I didn't see anything.
- You really missed a show, buddy.

200
00:10:43,527 --> 00:10:45,279
Yeah.

201
00:10:53,927 --> 00:10:57,158
You're probably wondering
why I wanted to see you again.

202
00:10:57,447 --> 00:10:58,562
Well, you know...

203
00:11:01,087 --> 00:11:02,884
It's understandable.

204
00:11:03,887 --> 00:11:05,320
I'm glad you feel that way.

205
00:11:05,487 --> 00:11:07,796
Because since my father's
breakdown...

206
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:10,197
...I've become very sensitive
to the warning signs.

207
00:11:10,767 --> 00:11:15,477
- Warning signs?
- Nervousness, irritability, paranoia.

208
00:11:15,647 --> 00:11:17,319
What?

209
00:11:17,687 --> 00:11:20,485
What are you talking about?
I'm not the one with the problem.

210
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:23,207
Lloyd Braun was in the nuthouse,
not me.

211
00:11:23,367 --> 00:11:26,439
Yeah, and taking pleasure
in the misfortunes of others.

212
00:11:26,647 --> 00:11:29,366
- All my friends do that.
- George, I'm only trying help.

213
00:11:29,527 --> 00:11:30,846
I'm concerned.

214
00:11:31,487 --> 00:11:32,476
George?

215
00:11:35,207 --> 00:11:37,482
- Are you listening to me?
- Do you see that woman?

216
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:42,240
She stole $20 from me.

217
00:11:42,407 --> 00:11:44,841
I might have gotten it back,
but Lloyd Braun interfered.

218
00:11:45,007 --> 00:11:47,396
So again it all comes back to Lloyd.

219
00:11:47,567 --> 00:11:48,886
Hey. Hey, you!

220
00:11:49,047 --> 00:11:52,835
Get back here!
Don't gallop away. I'm on to you.

221
00:11:56,447 --> 00:11:58,039
So you're saying
she was on a horse?

222
00:11:58,367 --> 00:12:01,723
I'm telling you, that cashier
is riding horses on my money.

223
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,525
Well, here's what I propose.

224
00:12:03,687 --> 00:12:05,518
Go down to the stables,
snoop around.

225
00:12:05,687 --> 00:12:10,238
See if any high-flying cashier has been
throwing $20 bills around with big lips.

226
00:12:11,967 --> 00:12:14,481
- Hey.
- Well, if it isn't Chesty Larue.

227
00:12:14,647 --> 00:12:17,923
- What?
- I was chewing gum with Lloyd Braun.

228
00:12:18,087 --> 00:12:20,442
He was bragging about
the show you gave him at the Alex.

229
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:24,646
Oh, God. I lost a button,
so my blouse was wide open.

230
00:12:24,807 --> 00:12:26,206
I must've left it at the theatre.

231
00:12:26,367 --> 00:12:28,164
- Maybe it's in the lost and found.
- I know.

232
00:12:28,327 --> 00:12:30,477
I have to go check it out.
It's a beautiful button.

233
00:12:30,647 --> 00:12:32,365
It's antique ivory.
It was my mother's.

234
00:12:32,527 --> 00:12:35,644
You know, the way you were wolfing
down that popcorn, maybe you ate it.

235
00:12:38,207 --> 00:12:41,279
Mr. Haarwood, what an unexpected
surprise to have you back at the Alex.

236
00:12:41,447 --> 00:12:44,962
Well, I'm in a bit of a quandary.
I've misplaced my spectacles.

237
00:12:45,127 --> 00:12:48,085
Well, let's look in lost and found,
shall we?

238
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:49,800
They're half glasses.

239
00:12:50,647 --> 00:12:52,797
- Brown?
- Yes, yes.

240
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:57,879
Yeah, well, if they're not in the box,
I'm sure they'll turn up soon.

241
00:12:58,127 --> 00:12:59,879
Listen, could you keep
an eye on the place?

242
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:01,685
I wanna go get some paraffin wax...

243
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:04,805
...and bring out the lustre
of this vintage countertop.

244
00:13:04,967 --> 00:13:06,764
Yes, certainly.

245
00:13:10,847 --> 00:13:12,678
Oh, my goodness.

246
00:13:12,847 --> 00:13:14,599
What a spanking button.

247
00:13:23,207 --> 00:13:26,040
All right, all right.

248
00:13:27,567 --> 00:13:30,127
Hang on. It's warming up.

249
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:36,922
Hey, what is your problem?

250
00:13:37,607 --> 00:13:40,280
Oh, hello. It's you.

251
00:13:40,447 --> 00:13:42,881
Listen, lady, I've got
six minutes left on that meter...

252
00:13:43,047 --> 00:13:45,959
...and I'm not budging until
you admit you stole my $20.

253
00:13:46,887 --> 00:13:49,959
You're not so stuff tough when you're
not on your horse, are you, Ruthie?

254
00:13:50,127 --> 00:13:51,640
Your car's on fire.

255
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:55,886
Merry Christmas.

256
00:13:56,047 --> 00:13:57,639
Fire!

257
00:13:59,487 --> 00:14:02,604
- Your hose! Where's your hose?
- The cop made me disconnect it.

258
00:14:15,727 --> 00:14:17,319
What happened to your car, buddy?

259
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,677
The Jon Voight car is no more.

260
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:25,124
Well, don't you sweat it. You can
use my car anytime you want to.

261
00:14:25,647 --> 00:14:27,797
- No kidding?
- No kidding.

262
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:30,197
Hey, thanks. I owe you a big one.

263
00:14:30,887 --> 00:14:34,926
- Yeah, merry Christmas.
- Whatever.

264
00:14:37,767 --> 00:14:40,520
- All right. I'm here. Where's Braun?
- What? He's not here yet?

265
00:14:40,687 --> 00:14:43,406
Look. I'll go downtown to Chinatown
with him, but that is it.

266
00:14:43,567 --> 00:14:45,285
- I need those glasses.
- Why?

267
00:14:45,447 --> 00:14:47,642
They're Jeffrey Haarwood's.

268
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,482
Here, try this pair.

269
00:14:53,287 --> 00:14:55,562
Wow, these are really...

270
00:14:56,527 --> 00:14:59,360
Hey, gum-buddy. Nice frames.

271
00:14:59,527 --> 00:15:02,087
- You ready to go?
- Yeah, yeah.

272
00:15:02,247 --> 00:15:04,203
Yeah, he's all ready to go.

273
00:15:04,367 --> 00:15:07,404
- Anybody see Elaine today?
- Oh, yeah, she called a little earlier.

274
00:15:07,567 --> 00:15:10,400
She's coming over
to check out lost and found.

275
00:15:10,927 --> 00:15:13,441
Maybe I'll stick around
and see what she's wearing today.

276
00:15:13,607 --> 00:15:15,359
Or not wearing,
if you know what I mean.

277
00:15:15,527 --> 00:15:17,438
Absolutely, let's just stick around.

278
00:15:17,607 --> 00:15:19,404
I'll tell you what,
they're expecting us.

279
00:15:19,567 --> 00:15:22,001
- Let me just grab a hot dog here.
- Oh, yeah.

280
00:15:22,727 --> 00:15:23,876
I'd like a hot dog, please.

281
00:15:25,927 --> 00:15:27,406
Are you out of your mind?

282
00:15:29,327 --> 00:15:30,999
What's the problem here?

283
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:33,635
This hot dog's been here
since the silent era.

284
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:36,719
- You'd have to be insane to eat it.
- No, no, this man is not insane.

285
00:15:36,887 --> 00:15:38,445
There's nothing wrong
with it or you.

286
00:15:38,607 --> 00:15:40,120
- Kramer-
- No, no, I'll show you.

287
00:15:40,687 --> 00:15:43,485
- One hot dog, please.
- Okay.

288
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,322
Doesn't that smell good, huh?

289
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,478
Here we go. Yeah.

290
00:15:49,167 --> 00:15:51,556
Oh, that's delicious.

291
00:15:51,727 --> 00:15:54,480
This is a perfectly sane food to eat.

292
00:15:56,727 --> 00:15:58,922
Interesting texture.

293
00:15:59,087 --> 00:16:00,964
It's chewy.

294
00:16:03,407 --> 00:16:05,796
I gotta get some air.

295
00:16:24,607 --> 00:16:26,325
Excuse me. Excuse me.

296
00:16:26,487 --> 00:16:28,603
Weren't you told
to stop using that hose?

297
00:16:29,087 --> 00:16:32,841
- How would you happen to know that?
- Well...

298
00:16:33,007 --> 00:16:36,044
You're that lady that was
talking to the cops, aren't you?

299
00:16:38,487 --> 00:16:42,719
- Hey, Joe!
- Oh, wait, wait! Stop it!

300
00:16:44,367 --> 00:16:47,564
- Hey, everybody.
- Whoa, Elaine!

301
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:51,720
Once again you've managed
to top yourself.

302
00:16:53,767 --> 00:16:56,486
Come on, Jerry, let's go.
The car is out front.

303
00:17:05,327 --> 00:17:06,919
Lloyd.

304
00:17:11,247 --> 00:17:12,441
Lloyd.

305
00:17:12,607 --> 00:17:14,802
What is Lloyd's problem?

306
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:17,800
Look, honey, I know you're trying
to get Lloyd to notice you...

307
00:17:17,967 --> 00:17:19,400
...but this is too much.

308
00:17:19,847 --> 00:17:22,236
Parading around in a wet T-shirt.

309
00:17:23,087 --> 00:17:25,999
I got sprayed with a hose.

310
00:17:26,167 --> 00:17:28,761
Yeah, well, I'm sorry,
but the Alex is a family theatre...

311
00:17:28,927 --> 00:17:30,724
...not one of your swing joints.

312
00:17:36,567 --> 00:17:39,479
So you want my father
to pay for this?

313
00:17:39,647 --> 00:17:41,797
Well, you saw him.
He was fiddling with the engine.

314
00:17:41,967 --> 00:17:43,400
God knows what he did there.

315
00:17:43,567 --> 00:17:46,286
And I suppose Lloyd Braun
had something to do with it too?

316
00:17:46,447 --> 00:17:49,598
- Not Lloyd Braun, but the cashier.
- What cashier?

317
00:17:49,767 --> 00:17:52,804
You remember the woman
on the horse? She wanted my spot.

318
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:56,001
- To park her horse?
- No, she wasn't on the horse.

319
00:17:56,687 --> 00:17:57,961
So your car caught fire...

320
00:17:58,127 --> 00:18:01,119
...because of my father
and the woman on the horse.

321
00:18:01,287 --> 00:18:04,120
That's right. And him.

322
00:18:05,247 --> 00:18:07,602
- The man with the flowers?
- Yeah, yeah, the flower guy.

323
00:18:07,767 --> 00:18:10,679
Listen, I know this all sounds
a little crazy, but-

324
00:18:10,847 --> 00:18:12,599
I can't believe it.
That's Jerry Seinfeld.

325
00:18:12,767 --> 00:18:14,405
- Who?
- Jerry Seinfeld, my best friend.

326
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:16,683
He can explain all of this.
Jerry, Jerry!

327
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:19,077
Over here, Jerry. It's me!

328
00:18:19,247 --> 00:18:21,966
Where are you going?
It's- What are you-?

329
00:18:23,887 --> 00:18:25,366
- That was your best friend?
- Yeah.

330
00:18:25,527 --> 00:18:28,678
- But he doesn't wear glasses.
- That man was wearing glasses.

331
00:18:28,847 --> 00:18:31,680
Don't you see? He was doing it
to fool Lloyd Braun.

332
00:18:37,247 --> 00:18:38,646
I'll run in and get the gum.

333
00:18:38,807 --> 00:18:40,798
- All right.
- Got any money?

334
00:18:48,247 --> 00:18:50,158
Here.

335
00:18:51,567 --> 00:18:53,319
I'll be back.

336
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:58,157
Look, Deena, I know you think
I'm crazy, but I'm not.

337
00:18:58,327 --> 00:19:01,000
This is just a series
of bad coincidences.

338
00:19:01,167 --> 00:19:03,317
I don't know, George.
I don't know what to believe.

339
00:19:04,047 --> 00:19:07,323
Believe me, I am not crazy.

340
00:19:07,807 --> 00:19:10,560
Well, I guess it's possible.

341
00:19:16,007 --> 00:19:17,804
Here you go.

342
00:19:17,967 --> 00:19:19,559
- All this?
- Yeah.

343
00:19:19,727 --> 00:19:22,605
- A hundred dollars worth.
- I gave you a hundred dollars?

344
00:19:22,767 --> 00:19:23,995
You sure did.

345
00:19:24,167 --> 00:19:27,842
- Am I crazy or is that a lot of gum?
- It's a lot of gum!

346
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,163
Mr. Haarwood, I found your glasses.

347
00:19:32,327 --> 00:19:33,806
Oh, splendid.

348
00:19:33,967 --> 00:19:36,356
Welcome to the
Institute for the Preservation...

349
00:19:36,527 --> 00:19:39,485
...of Motion Picture Costumes
and Wardrobes.

350
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,877
The I.P.M.P.C.W.

351
00:19:42,647 --> 00:19:44,797
We prefer to call it the Institute.

352
00:19:44,967 --> 00:19:47,083
- Is that from Henry VIII?
- Yes, yes, it is.

353
00:19:47,247 --> 00:19:49,920
Yeah, well, you know, we're
screening that tonight at the Alex.

354
00:19:50,087 --> 00:19:52,521
You think that I could wear
that to promote the theatre?

355
00:19:52,687 --> 00:19:55,679
Well, I'd love to lend it to you,
but I doubt if it would fit a man...

356
00:19:55,847 --> 00:19:59,317
...of your impressive
Raymond Massey-like physique.

357
00:19:59,487 --> 00:20:02,559
The only person who could
really fit into this costume...

358
00:20:02,727 --> 00:20:07,084
...would have to be a short, stocky man
of somewhat generous proportion.

359
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,163
You don't say.

360
00:20:12,047 --> 00:20:14,163
You're really helping
me out with this, buddy.

361
00:20:14,327 --> 00:20:17,399
- Kids are gonna be so thrilled.
- Yeah, yeah.

362
00:20:17,567 --> 00:20:19,956
You really cashed in
on that favour pretty quick.

363
00:20:20,127 --> 00:20:23,085
Remember, you are a king.
You must project a royal bearing.

364
00:20:23,247 --> 00:20:25,715
Oh, I'm going to give you
a royal bearing.

365
00:20:25,967 --> 00:20:28,561
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Let me get a pack of gum.

366
00:20:30,527 --> 00:20:32,916
Can I get a pack of gum, please?

367
00:20:34,087 --> 00:20:35,839
I beg your pardon, Your Majesty...

368
00:20:36,007 --> 00:20:38,726
...but we don't accept bills
with lipstick on the president.

369
00:20:39,727 --> 00:20:41,160
What?

370
00:20:43,047 --> 00:20:45,766
So I had it all along.
How do you like that?

371
00:20:45,927 --> 00:20:48,725
I guess I owe that cashier
an apology.

372
00:20:52,247 --> 00:20:54,442
Oh, my God.

373
00:20:55,127 --> 00:20:57,482
No, no, Deena,
it's not what you think.

374
00:20:57,647 --> 00:21:00,115
This isn't mine.
I got it from the Institute.

375
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,437
The Institute!

376
00:21:12,927 --> 00:21:14,121
Mr. Haarwood.

377
00:21:14,287 --> 00:21:16,676
Well, you certainly know
how to dress for a premiere.

378
00:21:16,847 --> 00:21:17,996
Well, thank you.

379
00:21:18,167 --> 00:21:21,876
- Where is your friend, King Henry?
- He ran away.

380
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:25,120
- Hey, Kramer.
- Let me talk to you.

381
00:21:25,287 --> 00:21:27,881
You know, that button
looks very familiar.

382
00:21:28,047 --> 00:21:30,083
Yes, it's antique ivory.

383
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:31,566
I think that's my button.

384
00:21:31,727 --> 00:21:33,558
You know, I've been
looking all over for it.

385
00:21:33,767 --> 00:21:35,997
- Did you find it here?
- It was in the lost and found.

386
00:21:36,207 --> 00:21:37,640
- Shall I undo it?
- Yes, of course.

387
00:21:37,807 --> 00:21:40,799
- Oh, thank you.
- I'm a little ticklish.

388
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:42,639
Tickle, tickle.

389
00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:45,522
We really gotta get
that Elaine a boyfriend.

390
00:21:45,687 --> 00:21:47,484
Oh, tell me about it.
