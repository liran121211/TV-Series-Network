1
00:00:02,747 --> 00:00:04,465
The pilot comes on
with his announcements:</i>

2
00:00:05,787 --> 00:00:07,539
"I'm going over this.
I'm going over that.</i>

3
00:00:07,707 --> 00:00:10,175
I'm taking a left. I'm bringing it up.
I'm taking it down.</i>

4
00:00:10,347 --> 00:00:12,622
I'm going right. I'm going this way.
Going that way."

5
00:00:12,787 --> 00:00:15,984
And we're back there,
"Yeah, that's all fine.</i>

6
00:00:17,107 --> 00:00:21,339
Just do whatever the hell you gotta do.
I don't know what the hell is going on."</i>

7
00:00:21,947 --> 00:00:24,336
Do I bother him? Do I go knocking
on the cockpit door?</i>

8
00:00:24,507 --> 00:00:26,623
"I'm having the peanuts now.</i>

9
00:00:28,187 --> 00:00:32,544
Just thought you might
like to know what we're doing."</i>

10
00:00:36,987 --> 00:00:38,818
Thank you. Good night.

11
00:00:40,347 --> 00:00:42,907
- Jerry!
- Hey, hey.</i>

12
00:00:43,067 --> 00:00:46,298
Sally Weaver. Susan Ross' roommate
from college?</i>

13
00:00:46,467 --> 00:00:49,186
- Hello?
- Right. Oh, I'm sorry.</i>

14
00:00:49,347 --> 00:00:52,419
- Oh, so you saw the show?
- Saw it? I loved it.</i>

15
00:00:52,587 --> 00:00:54,817
And thank you for the free tickets.
You are so funny.</i>

16
00:00:54,987 --> 00:00:56,545
- Oh, thanks.
- No, no, I mean it.</i>

17
00:00:56,707 --> 00:00:59,062
- You're very funny.
- I believe you.</i>

18
00:00:59,227 --> 00:01:00,819
Well, anyway, let me
show you Memphis.</i>

19
00:01:00,987 --> 00:01:03,455
- I am taking you out to dinner.
- Oh, I'm sorry, I can't...</i>

20
00:01:03,627 --> 00:01:06,221
- ... I'm going straight to the airport.
- Oh, that's too bad.</i>

21
00:01:06,387 --> 00:01:10,016
Susan thought we'd really get along.
I guess because we're both wacko.</i>

22
00:01:10,187 --> 00:01:13,418
You know what, you have to
give this to them for me. Okay?</i>

23
00:01:13,587 --> 00:01:15,179
Here, it's a wedding present.</i>

24
00:01:15,347 --> 00:01:18,100
Oh, and Jerry, be careful with it,
okay? Be very careful.</i>

25
00:01:20,467 --> 00:01:21,741
George, as you may be aware...</i>

26
00:01:21,907 --> 00:01:25,263
...your mother and I are not
moving to Del Boca Vista, Florida.</i>

27
00:01:25,427 --> 00:01:28,339
- I am aware.
- I was wondering, would it be okay...</i>

28
00:01:28,507 --> 00:01:30,975
...if I turned your room
into a billiard parlor?</i>

29
00:01:31,547 --> 00:01:32,741
A billiard parlor?

30
00:01:33,187 --> 00:01:36,543
Regulation table with a hi-fi,
maybe even a bar.</i>

31
00:01:36,707 --> 00:01:39,221
Give it some real authenticity.</i>

32
00:01:40,027 --> 00:01:43,702
- Well, that's- Elaine.
- Oh, hi, Frank.</i>

33
00:01:43,867 --> 00:01:48,497
- Sit down. Join us, please.
- Actually, I've gotta get to the thing.</i>

34
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:50,339
The thing's canceled. Sit down.</i>

35
00:01:51,707 --> 00:01:53,345
Okay.

36
00:01:55,507 --> 00:01:59,056
So, Frank, did George
ever show you that photo?</i>

37
00:01:59,387 --> 00:02:00,422
What photo?

38
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:03,226
The photo I took in Tuscany
of the man in front of the sign...</i>

39
00:02:03,387 --> 00:02:05,947
- ... that said Costanza.
- There's a Costanza in Tuscany?</i>

40
00:02:06,427 --> 00:02:08,782
Did he look like me?
Did you talk to him?</i>

41
00:02:08,947 --> 00:02:11,700
I didn't talk to anyone. I was just
walking by and saw the sign.</i>

42
00:02:11,867 --> 00:02:13,698
I thought George
might get a kick out of it.</i>

43
00:02:13,987 --> 00:02:16,057
I gotta get that picture.</i>

44
00:02:16,227 --> 00:02:18,900
- It could be my cousin, Carlo.
- Who is that?</i>

45
00:02:19,067 --> 00:02:22,662
When the Costanzas came here,
one brother stayed behind.</i>

46
00:02:22,827 --> 00:02:25,102
I played with his son every day
until the age of 4...</i>

47
00:02:25,267 --> 00:02:28,339
- ... when we were separated.
- So you weren't born here?</i>

48
00:02:28,507 --> 00:02:31,579
No. That's why
I could never be president.</i>

49
00:02:31,747 --> 00:02:33,226
It always hurt me.</i>

50
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:37,016
That's why, even at an early age,
I had no interest in politics.</i>

51
00:02:37,187 --> 00:02:40,145
I refuse to vote. They don't want me,
I don't want them!</i>

52
00:02:40,307 --> 00:02:42,025
I don't know why
you're getting riled up.</i>

53
00:02:42,187 --> 00:02:43,825
There's probably
a million Costanzas-</i>

54
00:02:43,987 --> 00:02:45,705
Don't bring me down.</i>

55
00:02:47,307 --> 00:02:50,583
- You have another copy of that photo?
- No, I don't.</i>

56
00:02:50,747 --> 00:02:53,466
- But, well, the Maestro might.
- The Maestro? What Maestro?</i>

57
00:02:53,627 --> 00:02:55,697
He's this guy
that I went to Tuscany with.</i>

58
00:02:55,867 --> 00:02:59,496
He's a great guy, but I just wouldn't
feel comfortable calling him.</i>

59
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:00,895
Really? Why?</i>

60
00:03:01,067 --> 00:03:03,865
Because he hasn't called me
since we got back.</i>

61
00:03:04,027 --> 00:03:08,896
I spilled wine on this 8-by-10 photo of
one of his favorite Italian opera stars.</i>

62
00:03:09,067 --> 00:03:10,466
Who?

63
00:03:10,627 --> 00:03:14,097
- You know the Three Tenors?
- Yeah, Pavarotti, Domingo...</i>

64
00:03:14,267 --> 00:03:16,656
- ... and the other guy.
- The other guy.</i>

65
00:03:21,307 --> 00:03:23,138
Can I take that box for you?</i>

66
00:03:23,427 --> 00:03:25,861
Well, you better not.
I'm supposed to be careful with it.</i>

67
00:03:26,027 --> 00:03:28,097
Then I'll have to put your bag
in the overhead.</i>

68
00:03:28,267 --> 00:03:30,178
Oh, okay.

69
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:39,625
There we go.</i>

70
00:03:42,187 --> 00:03:44,496
- Oh, look at this.
- What?

71
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:46,703
I bought a bottle
of barbecue sauce in Memphis.</i>

72
00:03:46,867 --> 00:03:48,346
I think the stewardess broke it...</i>

73
00:03:48,507 --> 00:03:51,499
...when she jammed it in the overhead
because of this stupid thing.</i>

74
00:03:51,667 --> 00:03:53,385
Don't press the panic button.</i>

75
00:03:53,707 --> 00:03:55,823
I'm sure that we can
still salvage some sauce.</i>

76
00:03:55,987 --> 00:03:57,625
I don't care about the sauce.</i>

77
00:03:57,787 --> 00:04:00,540
It came in this funny bottle
and there was a guy on the label...</i>

78
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:02,982
- ... looked exactly like Charles Grodin.
- I see.</i>

79
00:04:03,147 --> 00:04:05,945
No, you don't see. Because I'm going
on the show this week...</i>

80
00:04:06,107 --> 00:04:07,938
...and this was gonna be
my bit on the show.</i>

81
00:04:08,107 --> 00:04:09,938
- Why don't you do your material?
- I'm out.</i>

82
00:04:11,707 --> 00:04:13,186
Boy, you better get to work.</i>

83
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:15,778
Thanks for the tip.</i>

84
00:04:16,387 --> 00:04:19,220
- Hey, buddies.
- Hey. Hey, this is for you.</i>

85
00:04:19,387 --> 00:04:21,457
It's from Susan's roommate, Sally.</i>

86
00:04:21,627 --> 00:04:23,265
Oh, yeah, Sally called Susan.</i>

87
00:04:23,427 --> 00:04:26,703
- Said you guys really hit it off.
- Nobody hit anything off.</i>

88
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:28,937
She just gave me the box.</i>

89
00:04:31,867 --> 00:04:35,223
- What the hell are you doing?
- Well, I'm salvaging the sauce.</i>

90
00:04:35,387 --> 00:04:36,581
What's the matter with you?</i>

91
00:04:37,947 --> 00:04:39,505
Hey, hey, hey, come on. Come on.</i>

92
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:41,897
Jerry, why don't you do a bit
on Styrofoam?</i>

93
00:04:42,067 --> 00:04:45,298
- Like what?
- You know, "What is all this stuff?</i>

94
00:04:45,467 --> 00:04:47,662
Why do we need this stuff?</i>

95
00:04:47,827 --> 00:04:51,536
And why do they make them
so small?"</i>

96
00:04:53,387 --> 00:04:54,979
Where's the punch line?</i>

97
00:04:55,547 --> 00:04:57,538
It's all attitude.</i>

98
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,498
This is certainly a crappy gift.</i>

99
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:04,020
A doormat?

100
00:05:04,187 --> 00:05:06,018
That's what she had me lug up
from Memphis?</i>

101
00:05:06,187 --> 00:05:09,145
Pretty chintzy, huh?
Considering the money she makes.</i>

102
00:05:09,307 --> 00:05:11,343
She's a big executive
for Federal Express.</i>

103
00:05:11,667 --> 00:05:13,305
Federal Express?</i>

104
00:05:13,467 --> 00:05:15,697
Is she out of her mind?
Why didn't she just ship it?</i>

105
00:05:15,867 --> 00:05:19,382
Look, it's personalized.
"The Costanzas."</i>

106
00:05:19,547 --> 00:05:22,266
No. No, forget it. I don't want it.
Let's just get rid of it.</i>

107
00:05:22,427 --> 00:05:24,338
Maybe your father
would be interested in that.</i>

108
00:05:24,507 --> 00:05:27,067
I doubt it.
You know what he's doing now?</i>

109
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:29,616
He's putting a pool table
in my old bedroom.</i>

110
00:05:29,867 --> 00:05:34,065
Oh, yeah? Maybe I'll go out there and
knock a few balls around with him.</i>

111
00:05:34,227 --> 00:05:37,344
You know, show him a thing or two.

112
00:05:40,187 --> 00:05:42,906
So, what's your game?
What do you like to play?</i>

113
00:05:43,547 --> 00:05:45,458
- Eight ball.
- No, nothing doing.

114
00:05:45,627 --> 00:05:48,664
Let's you and me
play a game of straight pool.</i>

115
00:05:48,987 --> 00:05:50,898
You like to gamble, Cosmo?</i>

116
00:05:51,067 --> 00:05:54,855
Yeah, now and then.
You know how it is.</i>

117
00:05:55,027 --> 00:05:57,780
- Five dollars a game, huh?
- I'll break.</i>

118
00:05:57,947 --> 00:05:59,585
Okay.

119
00:06:37,947 --> 00:06:40,507
That's it. That's it. Seven.</i>

120
00:06:47,867 --> 00:06:49,585
What's-? What's all this?

121
00:06:49,947 --> 00:06:51,938
Oh, I'm just moving in
some more of my stuff.</i>

122
00:06:52,107 --> 00:06:54,302
More of her stuff.</i>

123
00:06:55,747 --> 00:06:57,465
Oh, I put up my doll collection.</i>

124
00:06:59,387 --> 00:07:01,378
Oh, my God.

125
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:04,778
- What is that?
- What? What is it?

126
00:07:05,587 --> 00:07:07,305
This doll looks like my mother.</i>

127
00:07:08,147 --> 00:07:10,741
- George, it's a doll.
- I know it's a doll.</i>

128
00:07:10,907 --> 00:07:12,977
But it looks like my mother.</i>

129
00:07:13,147 --> 00:07:15,707
Oh, get out of here.</i>

130
00:07:20,347 --> 00:07:22,338
- Seven, low.
- What's going on in here?</i>

131
00:07:23,987 --> 00:07:28,105
Are you two still playing?
You've been up here three hours.</i>

132
00:07:28,267 --> 00:07:30,986
- We haven't finished the first game.
- First game?</i>

133
00:07:31,147 --> 00:07:34,378
Well, we're still learning
the subtleties of the table.</i>

134
00:07:34,547 --> 00:07:36,902
He knows the Maestro.
He could have the picture.</i>

135
00:07:37,067 --> 00:07:40,264
Oh, forget about it.
It's not your cousin.</i>

136
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:42,099
You don't know that!

137
00:07:43,627 --> 00:07:46,903
- We gonna go see him, huh?
- As soon as the game is over.</i>

138
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:50,582
- Oh, boy.
- Eleven, the corner pocket.</i>

139
00:07:55,547 --> 00:07:57,299
What is this thing doing here?</i>

140
00:07:57,467 --> 00:08:01,142
Oh, I used to love to sleep
with my dolls when I was a little girl.</i>

141
00:08:01,307 --> 00:08:03,377
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

142
00:08:03,547 --> 00:08:06,107
- Why?
- I feel like I'm in bed with my mother.</i>

143
00:08:06,267 --> 00:08:08,019
Stop it.

144
00:08:17,507 --> 00:08:20,817
Hey, Elaine, you have to buy this
new electric toothbrush I just got.</i>

145
00:08:20,987 --> 00:08:22,420
- The Oro-Dent.
- Oh, yeah?</i>

146
00:08:22,587 --> 00:08:25,579
Every time you use it, you feel like
you just came from the dentist.</i>

147
00:08:25,747 --> 00:08:26,736
That's dynamite.</i>

148
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:29,375
Wanna come see me on
The Char/es Grodin Show tomorrow?</i>

149
00:08:29,547 --> 00:08:32,015
- Who else is on the show?
- One of the Three Tenors.</i>

150
00:08:32,187 --> 00:08:36,578
- The Three Tenors? Which one?
- It's not Pavarotti, it's not Domingo-</i>

151
00:08:36,747 --> 00:08:38,499
- The other guy?
- Yeah, the other guy.</i>

152
00:08:39,267 --> 00:08:42,703
My God, I can't believe the other guy
is gonna be on the show.</i>

153
00:08:42,867 --> 00:08:45,097
- Why?
- I ruined this autographed picture...</i>

154
00:08:45,267 --> 00:08:47,940
...of him that belonged to the Maestro.
You think I could go?</i>

155
00:08:48,107 --> 00:08:50,063
- I could get his autograph?
- Why not?</i>

156
00:08:51,347 --> 00:08:53,622
The other guy.</i>

157
00:08:56,427 --> 00:08:58,657
Hey, you look awful.</i>

158
00:08:58,827 --> 00:09:00,818
I'm on no sleep, bro.</i>

159
00:09:00,987 --> 00:09:04,980
- Problem in the bedroom?
- Susan has this doll collection.</i>

160
00:09:05,147 --> 00:09:08,184
One of the dolls looks
exactly like my mother.</i>

161
00:09:09,427 --> 00:09:12,100
She likes to sleep with it.</i>

162
00:09:12,787 --> 00:09:15,381
You were in bed with your mother
last night?</i>

163
00:09:15,907 --> 00:09:17,465
It felt like it.</i>

164
00:09:18,587 --> 00:09:20,464
I tell you, this doll is pretty spooky.</i>

165
00:09:21,307 --> 00:09:23,343
It's really freaking me out, man.</i>

166
00:09:24,187 --> 00:09:27,065
And now I gotta go back out there
and pick up this doormat.</i>

167
00:09:27,227 --> 00:09:29,787
- I thought you didn't want the doormat.
- I don't.</i>

168
00:09:29,947 --> 00:09:32,381
Susan wants to have it out
when Sally comes tomorrow.</i>

169
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,426
- Sally?
- Yeah.</i>

170
00:09:34,587 --> 00:09:36,259
Wait a minute.
She's coming to New York?</i>

171
00:09:36,427 --> 00:09:38,941
- Yeah, Susan said you'd be excited.
- Excited?</i>

172
00:09:39,107 --> 00:09:41,302
I'm gonna kill her.
She knew she was coming here...</i>

173
00:09:41,467 --> 00:09:43,935
- ... and she made me carry that box?
- Who is Sally?</i>

174
00:09:44,107 --> 00:09:46,780
- Susan's college roommate.
- It's her fault that bottle broke...</i>

175
00:09:46,947 --> 00:09:49,017
...that I was gonna give
to Charles Grodin.</i>

176
00:09:49,187 --> 00:09:51,223
Call her and tell her
to bring you another one.</i>

177
00:09:51,387 --> 00:09:54,026
- She'll be delighted to talk to you.
- Oh, I will. Don't worry.</i>

178
00:09:54,187 --> 00:09:56,223
I'll have her bring up
a whole case of the stuff.</i>

179
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:59,379
It'll be really heavy. Let's see
if she likes sitting on a plane...</i>

180
00:09:59,547 --> 00:10:03,017
- ... with a big box on her lap.
- That sounds pretty juvenile.</i>

181
00:10:03,307 --> 00:10:05,582
Hey, a dinosaur!</i>

182
00:10:07,187 --> 00:10:09,018
His name was Carlo Costanza.</i>

183
00:10:09,187 --> 00:10:10,984
We played together
every day until I was 4.</i>

184
00:10:11,147 --> 00:10:13,456
If I could look at your photos,
maybe I can recognize him.</i>

185
00:10:13,787 --> 00:10:16,347
Unfortunately, those photographs
are at home.</i>

186
00:10:16,507 --> 00:10:19,658
If you bring them by, maybe we
could interest you in a game of pool.</i>

187
00:10:20,027 --> 00:10:21,824
Frank here,
he's got his own billiard room.</i>

188
00:10:21,987 --> 00:10:25,377
Yes, it's- It's-
What do you call it, Kramer?</i>

189
00:10:25,547 --> 00:10:27,936
- It's a billiard room.
- No.

190
00:10:28,107 --> 00:10:29,540
- The name?
- The billiard-</i>

191
00:10:29,707 --> 00:10:32,346
Not billiard- Not the billiards-
It was-</i>

192
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:33,860
Come on, already. Come on.</i>

193
00:10:34,027 --> 00:10:35,745
- We call it the-
- The place to be.</i>

194
00:10:35,907 --> 00:10:37,704
The place to be!
Yes, it's the place to be.</i>

195
00:10:37,867 --> 00:10:39,585
Then I shall be there.</i>

196
00:10:39,827 --> 00:10:44,139
Now, gentlemen, if you will excuse me,
I must prepare for the symphony.</i>

197
00:10:44,307 --> 00:10:46,502
- Oh, yeah.
- Right.</i>

198
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:53,142
My pants.

199
00:10:53,307 --> 00:10:56,344
It's an old conductor's trick
I learned from Leonard Bernstein.</i>

200
00:10:56,507 --> 00:10:58,975
- Really?
- You keep a perfect crease...</i>

201
00:10:59,147 --> 00:11:01,536
...by not sitting in them
before the performance.</i>

202
00:11:01,987 --> 00:11:03,625
That is...</i>

203
00:11:03,987 --> 00:11:05,943
That's good thinking.

204
00:11:11,427 --> 00:11:12,701
You see?</i>

205
00:11:13,067 --> 00:11:14,102
You see?</i>

206
00:11:15,547 --> 00:11:17,219
It doesn't look exactly like her.</i>

207
00:11:17,867 --> 00:11:20,301
Jerry, come on.
If my mother keeps shrinking...</i>

208
00:11:20,467 --> 00:11:22,981
...this is exactly what she's
gonna look like in 10 years.</i>

209
00:11:23,147 --> 00:11:25,183
- Why don't you just get rid of it?
- I tried.</i>

210
00:11:25,347 --> 00:11:27,941
I almost threw it down the incinerator.
But I couldn't do it.</i>

211
00:11:28,107 --> 00:11:30,905
The guilt was too overwhelming.
Susan's so attached to it.</i>

212
00:11:31,067 --> 00:11:34,104
Well, where you going?
Don't take your dolly and go home.</i>

213
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:36,419
Hi, Elaine.</i>

214
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,501
- Did you see that?
- I'm just glad it's out of here.</i>

215
00:11:43,467 --> 00:11:47,858
- What's that?
- Oh, it's a poster of the Three Tenors.</i>

216
00:11:48,827 --> 00:11:50,818
- Yeah.
- It's Sa/y.</i>

217
00:11:50,987 --> 00:11:52,659
Did you bring
the barbecue sauce?</i>

218
00:11:52,827 --> 00:11:55,057
- A who/e case.
- Excellent.</i>

219
00:11:55,427 --> 00:11:57,736
Did you buy that electric toothbrush
I told you about?</i>

220
00:11:57,907 --> 00:12:00,262
- No.
- How come? I told you, it's fantastic.</i>

221
00:12:00,427 --> 00:12:03,146
- Yeah, I like mine.
- I've had yours.</i>

222
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:06,538
I'm telling you, this one is 10 times
better. Don't you believe me?</i>

223
00:12:07,387 --> 00:12:09,139
- I don't want it.
- I don't understand.</i>

224
00:12:09,307 --> 00:12:12,697
Why not get something that's better
if I'm telling you it's better?</i>

225
00:12:12,867 --> 00:12:15,586
And it's not a little better.
It's much better.</i>

226
00:12:16,547 --> 00:12:17,821
It doesn't matter to me.</i>

227
00:12:19,867 --> 00:12:21,061
Come in.</i>

228
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:23,220
Well, here I am.</i>

229
00:12:23,387 --> 00:12:25,776
- Oh, hi. Elaine, this is Sally.
- Hi.</i>

230
00:12:25,947 --> 00:12:28,984
- How was your flight? Uncomfortable?
- The seat next to me was empty...</i>

231
00:12:29,147 --> 00:12:31,342
...so there was no problem at all.</i>

232
00:12:32,867 --> 00:12:36,257
Wait. This isn't the sauce
that I asked for.</i>

233
00:12:36,427 --> 00:12:38,895
That's right.
It's a special gourmet sauce.</i>

234
00:12:39,067 --> 00:12:40,261
The pride of Memphis.</i>

235
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:44,340
No, I wanted the one with the guy on it
that looks like Charles Grodin.</i>

236
00:12:44,507 --> 00:12:47,021
This is much better.
And frankly, in Memphis...</i>

237
00:12:47,187 --> 00:12:50,338
...we think that other sauce
is kind of a joke.</i>

238
00:12:50,507 --> 00:12:53,067
I know it's a joke.
It's supposed to be a joke.</i>

239
00:12:53,227 --> 00:12:55,900
Now I'm going on The Char/es
Grodin Show with nothing.</i>

240
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:58,183
- Nothing!
- You could just do your material.</i>

241
00:12:58,347 --> 00:13:01,419
- I don't have any material!
- He's got nothing!</i>

242
00:13:08,987 --> 00:13:12,662
Georgie, don't eat with your hands.</i>

243
00:13:14,667 --> 00:13:17,465
Why do you eat so fast?
You can't even taste it!</i>

244
00:13:17,627 --> 00:13:19,822
Don't tell me how to eat.</i>

245
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:25,502
Sti/ wearing that shirt?
You've had it for five years a/ready.</i>

246
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:27,976
Why don't you buy a new shirt?</i>

247
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:30,862
Because I like this one.</i>

248
00:13:33,787 --> 00:13:35,425
Come on, let's go.</i>

249
00:13:35,587 --> 00:13:37,225
Let's go.</i>

250
00:13:37,787 --> 00:13:39,300
Oh, hi, Deena.</i>

251
00:13:46,707 --> 00:13:48,982
That man should really be
in a sanitarium.</i>

252
00:13:50,107 --> 00:13:52,177
Oh, this is remarkable.
I'm lounging...</i>

253
00:13:52,347 --> 00:13:54,417
...and yet my pants remain
perfectly creased.</i>

254
00:13:54,587 --> 00:13:57,659
It's him. It's Carlo Costanza.

255
00:13:57,827 --> 00:14:00,625
- Come on. Are you sure?
- I'd know him anywhere.</i>

256
00:14:00,787 --> 00:14:03,620
I've seen that man in Tuscany.
Eccentric fellow.</i>

257
00:14:03,787 --> 00:14:06,779
Reputation of being
kind of a village idiot.</i>

258
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:08,266
I still say we're related.</i>

259
00:14:08,427 --> 00:14:11,100
Oh, I love this piece.</i>

260
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,780
Come on, Frank, it's your shot.</i>

261
00:14:12,947 --> 00:14:15,063
- I can't make anything.
- Because you don't know...</i>

262
00:14:15,227 --> 00:14:17,377
- ... how to follow through correct.
- Follow through?</i>

263
00:14:17,547 --> 00:14:19,742
Here, let me show you.
Take hold of your stick.</i>

264
00:14:19,907 --> 00:14:24,537
- Yeah, I got it.
- Get down. Bring it back slowly.</i>

265
00:14:25,947 --> 00:14:28,825
It's a little unnatural,
but I think I'm getting the hang of it.</i>

266
00:14:29,107 --> 00:14:31,143
Oh, my God.

267
00:14:32,147 --> 00:14:35,264
I'm such an idiot. I was gonna do
this whole bit on that bottle.</i>

268
00:14:35,427 --> 00:14:39,056
- Now I got nothing to talk about.
- Have you ever considered writing...</i>

269
00:14:39,227 --> 00:14:40,785
...new material?</i>

270
00:14:41,307 --> 00:14:44,538
Maybe if I didn't have so many people
in my apartment all the time...</i>

271
00:14:44,707 --> 00:14:46,265
...I'd be able
to get some work done.</i>

272
00:14:46,627 --> 00:14:50,825
- Me? Are you talking about me?
- No, you're never here.</i>

273
00:14:52,667 --> 00:14:55,864
- That doll was really freaky, wasn't it?
- Yeah, really.</i>

274
00:14:56,027 --> 00:14:58,177
Hey, maybe I could talk about that
on the show.</i>

275
00:14:58,587 --> 00:15:00,339
- What?
- Show the doll. Show a picture...</i>

276
00:15:00,507 --> 00:15:04,295
...of George's mother. It's pretty funny.
I'm gonna call him.</i>

277
00:15:06,867 --> 00:15:08,744
- Hello?
- Hello, Susan, it's Jerry.</i>

278
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:10,181
Hi, Jerry, it's Sally.</i>

279
00:15:11,147 --> 00:15:12,421
Is George there?</i>

280
00:15:12,587 --> 00:15:14,737
- No, but he should be home soon.
- This is important.</i>

281
00:15:14,907 --> 00:15:17,865
Tell him to meet me at the TV studio
with a picture of his mother...</i>

282
00:15:18,027 --> 00:15:21,144
- ... and that doll that looks like her.
- Is this for your comedy routine?</i>

283
00:15:21,307 --> 00:15:24,185
- Yes.
- Don't worry, I'm on the case.</i>

284
00:15:29,147 --> 00:15:32,059
I think I'll get some air.</i>

285
00:15:32,227 --> 00:15:33,501
Yeah.</i>

286
00:15:36,067 --> 00:15:37,978
This is no good.

287
00:15:39,067 --> 00:15:40,420
Hey, the baton.</i>

288
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:46,976
Yeah, I've got a hunch, fat man,
I can't miss. Thirteen, in the side.</i>

289
00:15:47,627 --> 00:15:48,821
Giddyup.

290
00:15:48,987 --> 00:15:50,818
Six, in the corner.</i>

291
00:15:52,787 --> 00:15:54,345
This table's mine.</i>

292
00:16:01,907 --> 00:16:03,022
You know where it's going.</i>

293
00:16:10,067 --> 00:16:11,216
- Hey.
- Hey.</i>

294
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,218
- Is George here?
- Not yet.</i>

295
00:16:13,387 --> 00:16:14,900
The other guy.</i>

296
00:16:16,587 --> 00:16:18,179
It's...

297
00:16:19,507 --> 00:16:22,419
...you. It's really you.</i>

298
00:16:23,907 --> 00:16:26,819
I'm such a huge fan of yours.</i>

299
00:16:27,307 --> 00:16:29,582
Would you mind
signing this poster for me?</i>

300
00:16:29,747 --> 00:16:32,307
- My pleasure.
- Oh, thank you so much.</i>

301
00:16:32,467 --> 00:16:34,105
Here you go.</i>

302
00:16:35,187 --> 00:16:40,056
Thank you so much, Mr. Camaro.

303
00:16:41,827 --> 00:16:43,943
Mr. Casea.</i>

304
00:16:45,147 --> 00:16:46,626
Well, whatever.</i>

305
00:16:47,187 --> 00:16:48,666
I'm gonna take this to the Maestro.</i>

306
00:16:48,827 --> 00:16:50,897
He's playing at
the Queens Convalescent Center.</i>

307
00:16:51,067 --> 00:16:54,662
Yeah, that's a hell of a gig.
Hey, look, I got something for you.</i>

308
00:16:54,827 --> 00:16:55,942
The Oro-Dent.</i>

309
00:16:58,107 --> 00:16:59,142
Thank you.

310
00:17:01,027 --> 00:17:03,985
What-? Why does a toothbrush
come in such a big box?</i>

311
00:17:04,147 --> 00:17:06,741
Well, it's a delicate mechanism,
it needs a lot of packing.</i>

312
00:17:06,907 --> 00:17:08,738
How am I supposed to carry
this thing?</i>

313
00:17:12,507 --> 00:17:15,783
- What are you doing?
- Well, I wanna sit down.</i>

314
00:17:16,107 --> 00:17:18,541
- So?
- It's a trick I just learned from Kramer.</i>

315
00:17:18,707 --> 00:17:20,982
Keeps a crease in the pants.</i>

316
00:17:33,907 --> 00:17:38,139
Madam, you have been
an extremely gracious hostess.</i>

317
00:17:39,867 --> 00:17:41,459
Thank you, Maestro.</i>

318
00:17:41,747 --> 00:17:44,739
- Here, take a look at this.
- Yeah, what is it?</i>

319
00:17:44,907 --> 00:17:47,467
It's Carlo. I found him.

320
00:17:47,627 --> 00:17:50,266
You've been cooped up
in this room too long.</i>

321
00:17:50,427 --> 00:17:53,703
You never support me! Let's see
what George says about this.</i>

322
00:17:53,867 --> 00:17:55,585
Where are my pants?</i>

323
00:17:57,707 --> 00:17:59,504
Oh, beautiful.</i>

324
00:18:03,827 --> 00:18:06,216
- Hey there, Mr. Hairy Legs.
- Where's George?</i>

325
00:18:06,387 --> 00:18:09,459
Don't worry, I brought your doll.

326
00:18:10,747 --> 00:18:12,738
No, that's the wrong doll.</i>

327
00:18:12,907 --> 00:18:16,217
Jerry, I saw the doll you were
talking about. Not funny.</i>

328
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:19,823
This doll is much funnier. Look,
it has a bow tie and a cute little hat.</i>

329
00:18:19,987 --> 00:18:21,739
I think it's a riot.

330
00:18:22,627 --> 00:18:24,140
This is a nightmare.</i>

331
00:18:24,827 --> 00:18:28,183
Well, I'll be watching.
Don't screw up.</i>

332
00:18:31,147 --> 00:18:32,819
Too much sauce.</i>

333
00:18:36,027 --> 00:18:39,656
- My pants!
- Mr. Seinfeld, you're on.</i>

334
00:19:09,187 --> 00:19:11,655
Elaine. What a surprise.</i>

335
00:19:11,827 --> 00:19:15,945
I know you're very busy, but I just
wanted to come by and give you this.</i>

336
00:19:16,107 --> 00:19:19,304
Oh, Oro-Dent, that electric toothbrush.
I've heard so much about it.</i>

337
00:19:19,467 --> 00:19:22,743
No, no, no. Not the toothbrush.
This.</i>

338
00:19:32,147 --> 00:19:34,217
What a sweet gesture.
An autographed poster...</i>

339
00:19:34,387 --> 00:19:37,220
...of my favorite tenor
with those two other guys.</i>

340
00:19:37,947 --> 00:19:41,144
Oh, Elaine, this is magnifico.</i>

341
00:19:41,467 --> 00:19:43,935
I just felt so bad
about what happened in Tuscany-</i>

342
00:19:44,107 --> 00:19:46,223
Maestro, you're on.</i>

343
00:19:46,907 --> 00:19:49,740
Elaine, wait for me
after the concert.</i>

344
00:19:49,907 --> 00:19:53,058
- We'll celebrate.
- Oh, okay.</i>

345
00:20:28,787 --> 00:20:31,699
I wanna know why you took
my doll out of the house.</i>

346
00:20:31,867 --> 00:20:33,937
I just wanted a second opinion.</i>

347
00:20:39,227 --> 00:20:41,946
Take a look at this. Does that
look like my flesh and blood?</i>

348
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:45,144
- Of course, your mother-
- Oh, stop bothering everybody...</i>

349
00:20:45,307 --> 00:20:47,696
...with that picture. It's ridicu/ous.</i>

350
00:20:47,867 --> 00:20:52,179
Ridiculous? I'll show you ridiculous!
Come here!</i>

351
00:20:52,347 --> 00:20:54,736
No, Mr. Costanza- No!

352
00:20:55,507 --> 00:20:56,656
There.</i>

353
00:20:56,827 --> 00:20:59,660
Now what have you got
to say for yourself?</i>

354
00:21:00,347 --> 00:21:01,939
I told you it looked like her.</i>

355
00:21:15,867 --> 00:21:19,143
Carlo. It's me, Frank.</i>

356
00:21:27,067 --> 00:21:30,184
I'm your cousin, Frank.
Aren't you Carlo?</i>

357
00:21:30,347 --> 00:21:32,941
Carlo? No.

358
00:21:36,107 --> 00:21:37,825
What do you know?

359
00:21:38,227 --> 00:21:41,219
All right. I guess I was wrong.</i>
