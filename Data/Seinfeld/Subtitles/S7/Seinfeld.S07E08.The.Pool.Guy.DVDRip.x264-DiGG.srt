1
00:00:04,107 --> 00:00:06,416
<i>When did tick-tack-toe
become the pound sign?</i>

2
00:00:06,587 --> 00:00:07,781
Why not call it what it is?

3
00:00:07,947 --> 00:00:11,462
<i>"Leave your numeric message now,
and then press Archie's head."</i>

4
00:00:12,147 --> 00:00:14,342
<i>And what is that redial button?
Let's face it.</i>

5
00:00:14,507 --> 00:00:17,465
<i>You'll either get the person, the
machine or they have call waiting.</i>

6
00:00:17,627 --> 00:00:19,504
<i>Who is redialling and redialling?</i>

7
00:00:19,667 --> 00:00:22,739
<i>This is like the harassment key
for people in a fight, you know.</i>

8
00:00:22,907 --> 00:00:25,137
<i>Hey, I'm not through.</i>

9
00:00:25,707 --> 00:00:28,062
<i>You can't do that to me.</i>

10
00:00:28,227 --> 00:00:30,218
<i>And another thing.</i>

11
00:00:35,307 --> 00:00:37,298
<i>Who would win a fight
between you and me?</i>

12
00:00:37,467 --> 00:00:38,661
<i>What do you mean?</i>

13
00:00:38,827 --> 00:00:41,466
<i>If you and I ever got into
a really serious fight, you know...</i>

14
00:00:41,627 --> 00:00:43,777
<i>...and the punches started flying,
who would win?</i>

15
00:00:44,467 --> 00:00:46,776
<i>Well, I think that's pretty obvious.</i>

16
00:00:48,107 --> 00:00:49,859
<i>Yeah, me too.</i>

17
00:00:51,547 --> 00:00:52,741
<i>- Hey, Elaine.
- Hey.</i>

18
00:00:52,907 --> 00:00:54,977
<i>Who do you think would win
a fight between me...</i>

19
00:00:55,147 --> 00:00:57,217
<i>...and gorgeous George here?</i>

20
00:00:57,387 --> 00:01:00,902
<i>- You mean a real "fight"fight?
- Mano a baldo.</i>

21
00:01:01,787 --> 00:01:03,300
<i>George.</i>

22
00:01:04,107 --> 00:01:06,667
<i>- Why?
- George fights dirty.</i>

23
00:01:06,827 --> 00:01:08,055
<i>Really? What would you do?</i>

24
00:01:08,227 --> 00:01:12,425
<i>Pull hair, poke eyes, groin stuff.
Whatever I gotta do.</i>

25
00:01:13,547 --> 00:01:16,823
<i>So listen, you're not doing
anything tomorrow, are you?</i>

26
00:01:16,987 --> 00:01:21,856
<i>Because I have an extra ticket to the
historical clothing exhibit at the Met.</i>

27
00:01:22,027 --> 00:01:23,779
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:25,187 --> 00:01:26,336
<i>George?</i>

29
00:01:26,507 --> 00:01:29,704
<i>Would I want to see what
Mary Todd wore to Lincoln's funeral?</i>

30
00:01:29,867 --> 00:01:31,619
<i>There's nobody I can go with.</i>

31
00:01:32,747 --> 00:01:36,786
<i>You know what?
I don't have one female friend left.</i>

32
00:01:36,947 --> 00:01:40,144
<i>Well, no, of course, you don't.
You're a man's woman.</i>

33
00:01:40,307 --> 00:01:42,343
<i>You hate other women
and they hate you.</i>

34
00:01:42,507 --> 00:01:43,701
Thank you.

35
00:01:43,867 --> 00:01:46,256
<i>So, Jerry, what time
are we going to the movies?</i>

36
00:01:46,427 --> 00:01:49,225
<i>- How about the 8:30?
- Saddle up and ride.</i>

37
00:01:49,387 --> 00:01:52,504
<i>- You wanna get something to eat first?
- No, I'm good.</i>

38
00:01:54,467 --> 00:01:56,981
<i>I wonder if Susan-?</i>

39
00:01:58,547 --> 00:02:00,299
<i>No, I better just go.</i>

40
00:02:00,467 --> 00:02:02,901
<i>All right. See you.</i>

41
00:02:03,067 --> 00:02:07,060
<i>There's nothing more pathetic than
a grown man who's afraid of a woman.</i>

42
00:02:08,107 --> 00:02:10,575
<i>Hey, why don't you ask Susan?</i>

43
00:02:10,747 --> 00:02:12,260
<i>- George's Susan?
- Yeah.</i>

44
00:02:12,747 --> 00:02:14,817
<i>Yeah, why not Susan?</i>

45
00:02:14,987 --> 00:02:16,420
<i>I should be friends with Susan.</i>

46
00:02:16,587 --> 00:02:19,021
<i>Of course, Susan.</i>

47
00:02:19,947 --> 00:02:22,336
<i>Okay. I'll see you guys. Bye.</i>

48
00:02:24,587 --> 00:02:25,781
<i>That's gonna be trouble.</i>

49
00:02:27,867 --> 00:02:29,698
<i>- Why?
- Jerry, don't you see?</i>

50
00:02:29,867 --> 00:02:32,745
<i>This world here,
this is George's sanctuary.</i>

51
00:02:32,907 --> 00:02:37,059
<i>If Susan comes into contact
with this world, his worlds collide.</i>

52
00:02:38,067 --> 00:02:39,261
<i>You know what happens then?</i>

53
00:02:45,827 --> 00:02:47,579
<i>Did I tell you I'm getting
a new number?</i>

54
00:02:47,747 --> 00:02:49,863
<i>- How come?
- Chicks, man.</i>

55
00:02:50,027 --> 00:02:51,938
<i>Too many chicks know my number.</i>

56
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:57,063
<i>Hey, Jerry, how are you,
Mr. Backstroke?</i>

57
00:02:57,227 --> 00:02:59,582
<i>Kramer, this is Ramon
from the new health club I joined.</i>

58
00:02:59,747 --> 00:03:01,066
<i>- You know what happened?
- What?</i>

59
00:03:01,387 --> 00:03:02,581
<i>They fired me.</i>

60
00:03:02,747 --> 00:03:04,066
<i>- Really?
- Yeah.</i>

61
00:03:04,227 --> 00:03:06,138
<i>Said I put too much chlorine
in the pool.</i>

62
00:03:07,547 --> 00:03:10,857
<i>- Hey, well, stay out of the deep end.
- Okay. See you later.</i>

63
00:03:12,627 --> 00:03:14,743
<i>What's in the deep end?</i>

64
00:03:16,987 --> 00:03:18,306
<i>- Hello.
- Hey, George.</i>

65
00:03:18,467 --> 00:03:20,378
<i>- Hey, Laney, what's going on?
- Nothing much.</i>

66
00:03:20,547 --> 00:03:21,775
Can I talk to Susan?

67
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:26,058
<i>Yeah, right. Hang on.
I'll get her for you.</i>

68
00:03:26,227 --> 00:03:28,104
<i>Seriously, what's up?</i>

69
00:03:29,067 --> 00:03:31,535
<i>No, George, really,
can I talk to Susan?</i>

70
00:03:31,907 --> 00:03:33,056
Susan, why?

71
00:03:33,227 --> 00:03:36,105
<i>Because I wanna ask her to lunch
and to the Met tomorrow.</i>

72
00:03:36,267 --> 00:03:38,735
Oh, I don't think you wanna do that.

73
00:03:38,987 --> 00:03:41,706
<i>- Why not?
- Well, what would be the point of that?</i>

74
00:03:42,947 --> 00:03:44,221
<i>Will you put her on the phone?</i>

75
00:03:44,387 --> 00:03:46,457
<i>Where did this come from
all of a sudden?</i>

76
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:48,697
<i>Are you gonna let me
talk to Susan or not?</i>

77
00:03:48,867 --> 00:03:52,098
<i>I really think I should have
been consulted about this.</i>

78
00:03:53,907 --> 00:03:56,421
<i>Here. Something.</i>

79
00:03:57,707 --> 00:03:59,937
<i>Hello?</i>

80
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:03,702
<i>Oh, that sounds great.
Oh, I love that sort of stuff.</i>

81
00:04:04,627 --> 00:04:05,855
<i>- You wanna sit here?
- Yeah.</i>

82
00:04:07,067 --> 00:04:08,261
<i>Over there.</i>

83
00:04:08,787 --> 00:04:10,266
<i>- Why?
- A little buffer zone.</i>

84
00:04:12,387 --> 00:04:16,096
<i>If we were at my place on the couch,
would we sit right next to each other?</i>

85
00:04:16,267 --> 00:04:18,144
- No, you got a point.
- All right.

86
00:04:21,187 --> 00:04:22,779
I can't.

87
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:26,339
<i>- What are you doing?
- Well, these seats have no lumbar.</i>

88
00:04:30,227 --> 00:04:32,900
<i>Oh, hey, there's Ramon.
Pretend we're talking.</i>

89
00:04:33,427 --> 00:04:35,304
<i>- We are talking.
- Pretend it's interesting.</i>

90
00:04:35,987 --> 00:04:39,138
<i>So, well, then I had to kill him
and the police are still looking for me.</i>

91
00:04:39,307 --> 00:04:41,343
<i>- Yeah, that's...
- Hey, hi, Jerry.</i>

92
00:04:41,507 --> 00:04:43,225
<i>- Hey, Ramon.
- I took a lot of napkins.</i>

93
00:04:43,387 --> 00:04:44,706
<i>- You want some?
- Oh, no, thanks.</i>

94
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:46,186
<i>Hey, is this seat taken?</i>

95
00:04:46,347 --> 00:04:47,826
No.

96
00:04:52,107 --> 00:04:54,667
<i>And the worst part is, after the movie
he leeched onto us...</i>

97
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:57,057
<i>...we wound up having
coffee with him for two hours.</i>

98
00:04:57,227 --> 00:04:59,787
<i>Then he walks us home, all the way
back to the building.</i>

99
00:04:59,947 --> 00:05:03,098
<i>Finally, I said, "Look, Ramon,
I gotta go to bed now."</i>

100
00:05:04,667 --> 00:05:07,659
<i>- Have you spoken to Elaine yet today?
- No, why?</i>

101
00:05:07,827 --> 00:05:09,306
<i>She called Susan last night.</i>

102
00:05:09,467 --> 00:05:11,139
<i>Oh, yeah, I know.</i>

103
00:05:11,307 --> 00:05:13,980
<i>- How do you know?
- It was my idea.</i>

104
00:05:14,827 --> 00:05:16,545
<i>- Your idea?
- Yeah?</i>

105
00:05:16,707 --> 00:05:17,856
What'd you do that for?

106
00:05:18,547 --> 00:05:20,902
<i>She was looking for someone
to go to the show with.</i>

107
00:05:21,227 --> 00:05:23,741
<i>Well, that was really a stupid thing.</i>

108
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:26,421
<i>- You know what's gonna happen now?
- Worlds collide.</i>

109
00:05:26,787 --> 00:05:28,345
<i>Yeah.</i>

110
00:05:30,347 --> 00:05:32,099
<i>Because this world is
your sanctuary...</i>

111
00:05:32,267 --> 00:05:35,577
<i>- ... and if it comes in contact with this-
- Yes, it blows up.</i>

112
00:05:35,747 --> 00:05:37,544
<i>If you know,
what did you tell Elaine for?</i>

113
00:05:37,707 --> 00:05:39,698
<i>I didn't know. Kramer told me
about the worlds.</i>

114
00:05:39,867 --> 00:05:42,461
<i>You couldn't figure out
the worlds theory for yourself?</i>

115
00:05:42,627 --> 00:05:44,106
<i>It's just common sense.</i>

116
00:05:44,267 --> 00:05:48,021
<i>Anybody knows
you gotta keep your worlds apart.</i>

117
00:05:48,187 --> 00:05:49,825
<i>Yeah, I guess I slipped up.</i>

118
00:05:51,027 --> 00:05:52,255
<i>- Hey.
- Hey.</i>

119
00:05:52,427 --> 00:05:53,985
<i>He knows the worlds theory.</i>

120
00:05:54,147 --> 00:05:55,944
What? Is it blowing up?

121
00:06:00,947 --> 00:06:02,505
Cosmo, go.

122
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:05,340
No, no, no, no.

123
00:06:06,107 --> 00:06:08,063
<i>This new telephone number
is driving me crazy.</i>

124
00:06:08,227 --> 00:06:09,945
<i>Wrong numbers every five minutes.</i>

125
00:06:10,107 --> 00:06:13,224
<i>- What is it?
- Well, it's 555-3455.</i>

126
00:06:13,627 --> 00:06:16,699
<i>-555-3455.
- Yeah.</i>

127
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:21,626
555-3455.

128
00:06:21,787 --> 00:06:25,223
<i>Well, wait a second.
Don't you see? That's 555-FILK.</i>

129
00:06:25,387 --> 00:06:26,979
- What's "filk"?
- Filk's nothing.

130
00:06:27,147 --> 00:06:29,945
<i>But 555-FILM is Moviefone.</i>

131
00:06:30,107 --> 00:06:31,460
<i>Oh, Moviefone.</i>

132
00:06:31,627 --> 00:06:34,619
<i>Yeah, so people are just dialling it
by mistake and getting you.</i>

133
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:38,463
<i>- So I'm filk.
- You're filk.</i>

134
00:06:38,627 --> 00:06:40,458
Oh, Mama.

135
00:06:41,227 --> 00:06:43,661
<i>Well, but what about that number
Susan B. Anthony wore...</i>

136
00:06:43,827 --> 00:06:45,783
<i>...to the 19th Amendment party, huh?</i>

137
00:06:47,027 --> 00:06:50,656
<i>Quite the décolletage
for a suffragette.</i>

138
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,864
<i>Well, it must have been
one hell of a party.</i>

139
00:06:54,027 --> 00:06:55,779
<i>Oh, I know what I wanted to tell you.</i>

140
00:06:55,947 --> 00:06:57,346
What?

141
00:06:58,387 --> 00:06:59,581
<i>Forget it.</i>

142
00:06:59,747 --> 00:07:02,659
<i>What? You can tell me.
I'll put it in the vault.</i>

143
00:07:02,827 --> 00:07:04,419
<i>The vault?</i>

144
00:07:07,587 --> 00:07:10,784
<i>Mr. Seinfeld, we heard
you went to the movies with Ramon.</i>

145
00:07:10,947 --> 00:07:13,097
<i>I didn't actually go with Ramon.
I bumped into him.</i>

146
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:15,383
<i>It's good he has friends
like you to cheer him up.</i>

147
00:07:15,547 --> 00:07:18,061
<i>- Tell him to call us.
- Tell him Dustin says hello.</i>

148
00:07:18,227 --> 00:07:20,058
<i>- All right. I gotta go.
- To see Ramon?</i>

149
00:07:24,907 --> 00:07:26,135
<i>What else did you two do?</i>

150
00:07:26,307 --> 00:07:28,741
<i>Oh, I don't know.
You know, girlie stuff.</i>

151
00:07:29,667 --> 00:07:32,340
<i>So flower shows and shopping
for pretty bows...</i>

152
00:07:32,507 --> 00:07:35,897
<i>And then back to her place, strip down
to bra and panties for a tickle fight?</i>

153
00:07:42,947 --> 00:07:44,824
That's what you think girls do,
isn't it?

154
00:07:45,307 --> 00:07:47,616
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

155
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:49,625
Alrighty.

156
00:07:49,787 --> 00:07:53,985
<i>Hey, you know, George isn't too happy
about your new friendship.</i>

157
00:07:54,147 --> 00:07:56,422
<i>Yeah, well, I don't really give a sh-</i>

158
00:07:58,027 --> 00:08:00,097
<i>Hey, buddy, what's going on?</i>

159
00:08:02,387 --> 00:08:04,059
<i>Yeah, hello.</i>

160
00:08:04,227 --> 00:08:06,946
<i>Yeah, no, no, no. Hold on.</i>

161
00:08:11,787 --> 00:08:15,018
<i>Yeah, Cupid's Rif/e.
Eight-thirty, Sony Lincoln Square.</i>

162
00:08:15,187 --> 00:08:17,940
<i>Yeah, no, no, no.
No problem. Yeah.</i>

163
00:08:19,107 --> 00:08:21,575
<i>You're looking up movies
for people now?</i>

164
00:08:21,747 --> 00:08:23,465
<i>I got time.</i>

165
00:08:24,867 --> 00:08:26,266
And this.

166
00:08:26,427 --> 00:08:28,065
<i>Cosmo here.</i>

167
00:08:28,227 --> 00:08:31,264
<i>Yeah. No, no, no. I'll help.</i>

168
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:33,543
<i>Yeah, Firestorm's good.
I saw it yesterday.</i>

169
00:08:33,707 --> 00:08:35,425
<i>My buddy Jerry,
he's seen it twice.</i>

170
00:08:35,587 --> 00:08:37,020
You wanna talk to him?

171
00:08:37,187 --> 00:08:39,143
<i>- Here.
- No, Kramer. I don't wanna talk to-</i>

172
00:08:39,307 --> 00:08:42,743
<i>Just tell him about the picture.
What's the matter with you? Stop it.</i>

173
00:08:42,907 --> 00:08:45,137
<i>Yes, are you still there?
Look, I'm sorry about that.</i>

174
00:08:45,307 --> 00:08:48,458
<i>All right, there's an 8:30
and a 10: 15 showing.</i>

175
00:08:50,107 --> 00:08:51,540
<i>Oh, that's George. Yeah?</i>

176
00:08:51,707 --> 00:08:53,060
<i>Hey, it's Ramon.</i>

177
00:08:53,227 --> 00:08:55,582
<i>- What?
- It's Ramon, Jerry. I'm coming up.</i>

178
00:08:56,307 --> 00:08:57,501
Oh, okay.

179
00:08:57,667 --> 00:08:59,066
<i>What is he doing here?</i>

180
00:08:59,227 --> 00:09:01,661
<i>- Who? Who is Ramon?
- He's the pool guy.</i>

181
00:09:01,827 --> 00:09:03,306
<i>- What pool guy?
- Do me a favour.</i>

182
00:09:03,467 --> 00:09:05,537
<i>- Stick around while he's here.
- Yeah, no problem.</i>

183
00:09:05,707 --> 00:09:08,096
<i>Hey, Jerry, how are you, crazy guy?</i>

184
00:09:09,387 --> 00:09:12,424
<i>- So, Ramon, this is my friend Elaine.
- Yeah, and I was just leaving.</i>

185
00:09:15,707 --> 00:09:17,379
<i>Bye-bye, Jerry.</i>

186
00:09:19,907 --> 00:09:22,467
<i>- What are you doing around here?
- I was in the neighbourhood.</i>

187
00:09:22,627 --> 00:09:25,346
<i>- I figured I'd check you out.
- I kind of had some things to do.</i>

188
00:09:25,507 --> 00:09:27,225
<i>Oh, yeah?
Where are you going?</i>

189
00:09:27,387 --> 00:09:30,220
Just, you know, I don't know.
Stuff I gotta do.

190
00:09:30,387 --> 00:09:33,220
<i>Hey, that's cool.
I'm up for some stuff.</i>

191
00:09:33,867 --> 00:09:35,425
All right.

192
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:40,903
<i>So get this. I get down there...</i>

193
00:09:41,067 --> 00:09:43,979
<i>...and right away
I see the drain is clogged.</i>

194
00:09:44,147 --> 00:09:47,935
<i>- It's obvious. Can you believe that?
- All right, Ramon. I'm gonna get going.</i>

195
00:09:49,467 --> 00:09:52,504
<i>- I think we should separate here.
- What are you trying to say, Jerry?</i>

196
00:09:52,667 --> 00:09:55,625
<i>Look. You're a nice guy,
but I actually only have three friends.</i>

197
00:09:55,787 --> 00:09:57,061
<i>I really can't handle any more.</i>

198
00:09:57,227 --> 00:09:59,104
<i>I see. It's because I clean pools,
right?</i>

199
00:09:59,267 --> 00:10:01,497
That has nothing to do with it.

200
00:10:04,707 --> 00:10:06,584
<i>Yeah, we got along real well.</i>

201
00:10:06,747 --> 00:10:10,023
<i>Because, you know,
she has no female friends.</i>

202
00:10:10,187 --> 00:10:12,257
You know that, don't you?

203
00:10:12,427 --> 00:10:15,464
<i>Something strange about a woman
whose friends are all men.</i>

204
00:10:15,627 --> 00:10:19,063
<i>Yeah, I know.
We talked all about that.</i>

205
00:10:19,227 --> 00:10:21,183
<i>- You talked all about that?
- Oh, yeah.</i>

206
00:10:21,347 --> 00:10:24,225
<i>Elaine opened up her vault.</i>

207
00:10:26,187 --> 00:10:27,461
Did you just say "vault"?

208
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,379
<i>Yeah, why? Did I use it wrong?</i>

209
00:10:29,707 --> 00:10:30,901
<i>You got that from Elaine?</i>

210
00:10:31,067 --> 00:10:33,456
<i>Yeah. So what?</i>

211
00:10:33,627 --> 00:10:35,538
<i>Well, it's a little strange.</i>

212
00:10:35,707 --> 00:10:38,540
<i>Are you gonna start
to talk like Elaine from now on?</i>

213
00:10:38,707 --> 00:10:39,901
I don't know.

214
00:10:40,067 --> 00:10:42,422
<i>Anyway, I thought
we'd all go to a movie on Friday.</i>

215
00:10:42,587 --> 00:10:44,578
<i>We'd all go to a movie on Friday?</i>

216
00:10:44,747 --> 00:10:46,066
<i>Yeah.</i>

217
00:10:46,267 --> 00:10:48,417
This is not good.

218
00:10:48,587 --> 00:10:51,055
<i>Worlds are colliding.</i>

219
00:10:51,227 --> 00:10:53,695
<i>George is getting upset!</i>

220
00:10:59,147 --> 00:11:02,184
<i>You have no idea
of the magnitude of this thing.</i>

221
00:11:02,347 --> 00:11:05,100
<i>If she is allowed
to infiltrate this world...</i>

222
00:11:05,267 --> 00:11:08,862
<i>...then George Costanza,
as you know him, ceases to exist.</i>

223
00:11:09,547 --> 00:11:12,937
<i>You see, right now,
I have relationship George...</i>

224
00:11:13,107 --> 00:11:16,702
<i>...but there is also
independent George.</i>

225
00:11:16,867 --> 00:11:19,620
<i>That's the George you know,
the George you grew up with.</i>

226
00:11:19,787 --> 00:11:24,258
<i>Movie George, coffee-shop George,
liar George, bawdy George.</i>

227
00:11:24,427 --> 00:11:29,262
<i>- I love that George.
- Me too. And he's dying, Jerry.</i>

228
00:11:29,427 --> 00:11:32,260
<i>If relationship George
walks through this door...</i>

229
00:11:32,427 --> 00:11:34,816
<i>...he will kill independent George.</i>

230
00:11:35,867 --> 00:11:39,940
<i>A George divided against itself
cannot stand.</i>

231
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:47,025
<i>You're killing independent George.
You know that, don't you?</i>

232
00:11:47,187 --> 00:11:48,666
<i>George, I don't even wanna get-</i>

233
00:11:48,827 --> 00:11:52,263
<i>You know what word Susan
used last night? "Vault."</i>

234
00:11:52,427 --> 00:11:54,816
<i>- So?
- She got that from you.</i>

235
00:11:54,987 --> 00:11:56,579
<i>Well, I didn't tell her to say it.</i>

236
00:11:56,747 --> 00:11:59,625
<i>Is she the only girl in the whole world?
Can't you find your own?</i>

237
00:11:59,787 --> 00:12:01,345
<i>I like her.</i>

238
00:12:01,507 --> 00:12:04,305
<i>You see? You see?</i>

239
00:12:04,467 --> 00:12:06,583
<i>You see what I'm talking about?</i>

240
00:12:06,747 --> 00:12:10,217
It's all just slipping away.

241
00:12:10,387 --> 00:12:12,184
<i>And you're all letting it happen.</i>

242
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:17,065
<i>- So you wanna catch a movie later?
- Yeah, sure.</i>

243
00:12:17,627 --> 00:12:20,141
<i>I don't have a paper, though.</i>

244
00:12:24,667 --> 00:12:27,261
<i>Hello, and welcome to Moviefone.</i>

245
00:12:27,427 --> 00:12:31,466
<i>Brought to you by
The New York Times and Hot 97.</i>

246
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:33,857
<i>Coming to theatres this Friday:</i>

247
00:12:34,027 --> 00:12:36,302
<i>Kevin Bacon, Susan Sarandon.</i>

248
00:12:36,467 --> 00:12:38,503
<i>You've got to get me
over that mountain!</i>

249
00:12:38,667 --> 00:12:40,817
No!

250
00:12:45,467 --> 00:12:50,495
<i>There's no higher place
than Mountain High. Rated R.</i>

251
00:12:50,667 --> 00:12:54,023
<i>If you know the name of the movie
you'd like to see, press one.</i>

252
00:12:54,187 --> 00:12:57,145
<i>Kramer, is that you?</i>

253
00:12:57,867 --> 00:12:59,698
<i>Elaine?</i>

254
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:06,017
<i>What time does Chow Fun start?</i>

255
00:13:07,627 --> 00:13:09,265
I don't know.

256
00:13:13,067 --> 00:13:16,298
<i>Well, well, look who's here.</i>

257
00:13:16,467 --> 00:13:18,822
<i>What are you doing here?
You could get in trouble.</i>

258
00:13:18,987 --> 00:13:20,500
<i>No, I don't think so, Jerry.</i>

259
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:22,339
<i>You see, they gave me my job back.</i>

260
00:13:22,507 --> 00:13:26,022
- What?
- I'm a pool boy again.

261
00:13:26,187 --> 00:13:29,543
<i>Look, Ramon, about the other day,
I'm sorry if I offended you.</i>

262
00:13:29,707 --> 00:13:31,299
<i>I get a little crabby on the subway.</i>

263
00:13:31,467 --> 00:13:32,741
Oh, do you?

264
00:13:33,507 --> 00:13:34,986
<i>What happened to all the towels?</i>

265
00:13:35,787 --> 00:13:38,665
<i>I guess they must have
disappeared.</i>

266
00:13:39,587 --> 00:13:44,217
<i>Hey, Jerry, look at all the towels they
gave me. I really hit the jackpot.</i>

267
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:50,060
<i>It's been a terrible situation down there
the past couple of days.</i>

268
00:13:50,227 --> 00:13:52,343
<i>He's really making things
uncomfortable for me.</i>

269
00:13:52,507 --> 00:13:55,226
<i>There's always a big pile
of dirty towels in front of my locker.</i>

270
00:13:55,387 --> 00:13:57,696
<i>Then when I come out of pool,
my towel is always gone.</i>

271
00:13:57,867 --> 00:14:00,779
<i>- So frustrating.
- Tell me about it.</i>

272
00:14:00,947 --> 00:14:04,257
<i>So you wanna join me and Susan
for lunch at the coffee shop?</i>

273
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:07,146
<i>- You're meeting at the coffee shop?
- Yeah.</i>

274
00:14:07,307 --> 00:14:09,377
<i>I'm meeting George
for lunch at the coffee shop.</i>

275
00:14:11,787 --> 00:14:14,585
<i>Well, this should be very interesting.</i>

276
00:14:18,587 --> 00:14:22,023
<i>- Hey, Elaine, Jerry. Over here.
- Oh, there they are.</i>

277
00:14:22,187 --> 00:14:23,381
<i>- Look who I ran into.
- Great.</i>

278
00:14:23,547 --> 00:14:26,141
<i>- Yeah.
- Yeah.</i>

279
00:14:27,187 --> 00:14:28,779
<i>Come on. Aren't you gonna
join us?</i>

280
00:14:28,947 --> 00:14:31,586
<i>You know, I'm supposed to meet...</i>

281
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:32,896
<i>...someone.</i>

282
00:14:33,067 --> 00:14:35,786
<i>- I'll wait for him outside.
- Wait here. Come on, sit down.</i>

283
00:14:35,947 --> 00:14:37,938
<i>What's the matter with you?</i>

284
00:14:38,387 --> 00:14:40,742
<i>This is gonna be ugly.</i>

285
00:14:41,187 --> 00:14:45,897
<i>- What's that, Jerry?
- I said, boy, am I ugly.</i>

286
00:14:47,427 --> 00:14:49,543
<i>Hey, hey, Georgie boy, over here.</i>

287
00:15:02,827 --> 00:15:04,579
<i>One, two...</i>

288
00:15:05,707 --> 00:15:07,220
<i>...three...</i>

289
00:15:08,747 --> 00:15:10,021
...four.

290
00:15:15,467 --> 00:15:18,982
<i>- Hey, George!
- No, we'll pull up another chair.</i>

291
00:15:34,147 --> 00:15:36,138
<i>I see you there, Ramon.</i>

292
00:15:36,307 --> 00:15:38,980
<i>Hey, I'm not done.</i>

293
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:41,536
<i>I know what you're up to, Ramon.</i>

294
00:15:42,387 --> 00:15:45,538
<i>Because I'm a member here,
this is my place to swim.</i>

295
00:15:45,707 --> 00:15:48,380
<i>Now, you better cut it out, Ramon.
Just stop it.</i>

296
00:15:53,627 --> 00:15:54,980
<i>Ollie, ollie, oxen free!</i>

297
00:15:57,547 --> 00:15:59,458
No!

298
00:16:04,947 --> 00:16:08,417
<i>I think he's gonna need
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.</i>

299
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:10,655
Mouth-to-mouth?

300
00:16:12,107 --> 00:16:13,301
<i>Yeah.</i>

301
00:16:17,587 --> 00:16:18,815
<i>Well...</i>

302
00:16:19,867 --> 00:16:20,982
<i>...go ahead.</i>

303
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,865
You go.

304
00:16:25,227 --> 00:16:27,024
<i>You knocked him out.</i>

305
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:28,540
<i>Yeah, but you pulled him in.</i>

306
00:16:28,707 --> 00:16:31,540
<i>Come on, Newman. Do it.</i>

307
00:16:32,467 --> 00:16:33,946
No.

308
00:16:36,307 --> 00:16:38,184
<i>He might die.</i>

309
00:16:38,347 --> 00:16:40,099
<i>Yeah. Maybe.</i>

310
00:16:42,507 --> 00:16:44,498
<i>Jerry, we'll meet you
at the theatre. Okay.</i>

311
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:46,737
<i>Next showing's at 9:00.
We can't wait any longer.</i>

312
00:16:46,907 --> 00:16:49,375
<i>Where could he be?
It's not like George to just disappear.</i>

313
00:16:49,547 --> 00:16:51,458
<i>Look, let's just leave him
a note, okay?</i>

314
00:16:51,627 --> 00:16:53,185
<i>- I don't know.
- Oh, come on. Come on.</i>

315
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:54,746
<i>"George.</i>

316
00:16:54,907 --> 00:17:00,459
<i>Elaine and I went
to see Chunne/...</i>

317
00:17:00,627 --> 00:17:02,026
<i>...with Jerry."</i>

318
00:17:02,787 --> 00:17:04,106
<i>- "Love"?
- Yeah.</i>

319
00:17:04,267 --> 00:17:06,735
<i>"Love, Susan."</i>

320
00:17:07,347 --> 00:17:09,178
<i>So eventually these people came...</i>

321
00:17:09,347 --> 00:17:11,383
<i>...and somebody gave him
mouth-to-mouth.</i>

322
00:17:11,547 --> 00:17:12,900
<i>He could have died.</i>

323
00:17:13,347 --> 00:17:14,746
<i>Yeah, it was a gamble.</i>

324
00:17:14,907 --> 00:17:16,545
<i>Why didn't you give him
mouth-to-mouth?</i>

325
00:17:19,467 --> 00:17:22,106
<i>How can you possibly
show your face there again?</i>

326
00:17:22,267 --> 00:17:23,939
<i>Oh, I can't.
They revoked my membership.</i>

327
00:17:24,107 --> 00:17:27,065
<i>Newman too. No, we can't go
anywhere near there.</i>

328
00:17:27,227 --> 00:17:33,063
<i>Hi. Three for Chunne/.
