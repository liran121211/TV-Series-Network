1
00:00:04,577 --> 00:00:07,296
I love when the car place
puts that paper mat on the floor.

2
00:00:07,457 --> 00:00:10,255
Like they're so obsessed
with cleanliness.

3
00:00:10,417 --> 00:00:12,647
They don't even want their shoes
to touch the carpet.

4
00:00:12,817 --> 00:00:15,172
The mechanic comes out,
he looks like Al Jolson.

5
00:00:15,337 --> 00:00:19,012
He's covered in goo from head to toe.
You can't even see him.

6
00:00:19,377 --> 00:00:22,494
I prefer that to when they have the
lab coat, the clipboard, the glasses.

7
00:00:22,657 --> 00:00:24,613
Now you know
you're getting screwed.

8
00:00:25,177 --> 00:00:26,166
"Can I see it?"

9
00:00:26,337 --> 00:00:29,135
"You better not.
It's idling quietly right now.

10
00:00:29,297 --> 00:00:30,730
I think it should stay overnight.

11
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:33,969
We want to keep an eye on it,
and want to keep the bill running up."

12
00:00:40,177 --> 00:00:42,247
Tell the players that
I reimbursed the trainer...

13
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:43,896
...for the cigarettes and shakes.

14
00:00:44,057 --> 00:00:46,207
- The players will be reimbursed?
- The trainer.

15
00:00:46,377 --> 00:00:48,174
Tell the players
I reimbursed the trainer.

16
00:00:48,417 --> 00:00:50,647
This is the third time
I've had to repeat myself.

17
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:52,569
- Sorry.
- Sorry doesn't cut it.

18
00:00:52,737 --> 00:00:54,329
We're running
a ball club here, George.

19
00:00:54,497 --> 00:00:56,374
You've got to pay attention.

20
00:00:56,537 --> 00:00:57,811
I know. It won't happen again.

21
00:00:57,977 --> 00:01:00,696
Let me see.
I had an assignment for you.

22
00:01:01,537 --> 00:01:04,210
Let me... Let me think here.

23
00:01:12,097 --> 00:01:13,291
Elaine.

24
00:01:13,457 --> 00:01:14,731
Hi, Mr. Peterman.

25
00:01:14,897 --> 00:01:18,333
You know what a huge fan
I am of John F. Kennedy.

26
00:01:18,497 --> 00:01:20,010
I do.

27
00:01:20,177 --> 00:01:22,532
The Peace Corps gave me
my start in this business.

28
00:01:22,697 --> 00:01:25,928
Clothing the naked natives
of Bangtubesh.

29
00:01:26,097 --> 00:01:27,576
The Pygmy pullover.

30
00:01:29,857 --> 00:01:32,451
Sotheby's is having an auction
of JFK's memorabilia.

31
00:01:32,617 --> 00:01:35,575
One item in particular
has caught my eye.

32
00:01:35,737 --> 00:01:37,216
The presidential golf clubs.

33
00:01:37,777 --> 00:01:41,929
To me, they capture that indefinable
romance that was Camelot.

34
00:01:42,097 --> 00:01:43,086
Whatever.

35
00:01:43,257 --> 00:01:45,452
Unfortunately, I will be
out of town with my lady...

36
00:01:45,617 --> 00:01:47,528
...and therefore unable
to bid on the lot.

37
00:01:47,697 --> 00:01:49,494
I was hoping you would go
in my stead.

38
00:01:49,657 --> 00:01:52,410
Oh, yeah. I'd be happy to.

39
00:01:52,577 --> 00:01:56,889
How much do you want this thing?
How high are you willing to go?

40
00:01:57,057 --> 00:02:01,448
I would see no trouble in spending
up to, say, $10,000.

41
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,215
Have my secretary give you a check.

42
00:02:10,177 --> 00:02:12,566
- When you're done, George,
and bring it directly to me.

43
00:02:12,737 --> 00:02:15,570
Mr. Steinbrenner is
very interested in this.

44
00:02:16,657 --> 00:02:18,648
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, George.

45
00:02:18,817 --> 00:02:20,933
I want you to make this project
a top priority.

46
00:02:21,097 --> 00:02:22,735
I will, sir. Top priority.

47
00:02:22,897 --> 00:02:25,457
- Top priority, George.
- Top priority.

48
00:02:30,577 --> 00:02:33,296
So he walks out of the stall.
He's been talking the whole time.

49
00:02:33,457 --> 00:02:35,573
- He pulled an LBJ on you.
- LBJ?

50
00:02:35,737 --> 00:02:38,092
Lyndon Johnson used to do that
to his staffers.

51
00:02:38,257 --> 00:02:39,246
- No kidding?
- Oh, yeah.

52
00:02:39,417 --> 00:02:41,328
He'd hold national security
meetings in there.

53
00:02:41,497 --> 00:02:44,887
He planned the Hanoi bombing
after a bad Thai meal.

54
00:02:45,417 --> 00:02:47,135
I don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

55
00:02:47,297 --> 00:02:49,049
I don't even know
what my assignment is.

56
00:02:49,217 --> 00:02:51,287
Ask him to repeat it.
Tell him there was an echo.

57
00:02:51,457 --> 00:02:53,766
I can't. He's been on me
about not paying attention.

58
00:02:53,937 --> 00:02:56,007
It's too late.
I already told him I heard him.

59
00:02:56,697 --> 00:02:59,006
You know what you do?
Ask him a follow-up question.

60
00:02:59,177 --> 00:03:02,249
Tell him you're having trouble getting
started, and you want his advice.

61
00:03:03,377 --> 00:03:06,096
Yeah, follow-up question.
That'll work.

62
00:03:06,497 --> 00:03:07,532
- Hey, bud.
- Hey.

63
00:03:07,697 --> 00:03:08,846
- Can I have my keys...
- Yeah.

64
00:03:09,017 --> 00:03:10,086
- Back please.

65
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:12,532
- You should have come, Jerry.
- We made quite a haul.

66
00:03:12,697 --> 00:03:14,653
- Where did you go?
- Price Club.

67
00:03:14,817 --> 00:03:17,536
- Why didn't you take your car?
- Oh, the steering wheel fell off.

68
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,892
I don't know where it is.

69
00:03:20,057 --> 00:03:21,809
What are you doing?
Don't throw that away.

70
00:03:21,977 --> 00:03:24,889
Well, I'm not paying the 5 cents
for that stupid recycling thing.

71
00:03:25,057 --> 00:03:27,412
You don't pay 5 cents.
You get 5 cents back.

72
00:03:27,577 --> 00:03:28,566
Read the label.

73
00:03:28,737 --> 00:03:30,807
"Vermont, Connecticut,
Massachusetts, New York.

74
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:32,410
Refund, 5 cents."

75
00:03:32,577 --> 00:03:33,771
- Refund?
- Yeah.

76
00:03:33,937 --> 00:03:36,246
Well, what do you think
the hobos are doing?

77
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:39,090
I don't know. They're deranged.

78
00:03:39,937 --> 00:03:42,212
Listen. Can you give me
a lift back to my place?

79
00:03:42,377 --> 00:03:45,847
No, I can't. I've gotta pick up Elaine.
I'm taking her to this Kennedy auction.

80
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:48,212
- All right. I'll see you later.
- All right.

81
00:03:48,377 --> 00:03:51,608
- What is this "MI, 10 cents"?
- That's Michigan.

82
00:03:51,777 --> 00:03:53,290
In Michigan you get 10 cents.

83
00:03:53,457 --> 00:03:54,651
- Ten cents?
- Yeah.

84
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:57,536
Wait a minute, you mean you get
5 cents here and 10 cents there?

85
00:03:57,697 --> 00:03:59,927
You could round up bottles
and run them to Michigan.

86
00:04:00,097 --> 00:04:01,769
- No, it doesn't work.
- What do you mean?

87
00:04:01,937 --> 00:04:02,972
You get enough bottles...

88
00:04:03,137 --> 00:04:06,129
You overload your inventory, and you
blow your margins on gasoline.

89
00:04:06,297 --> 00:04:07,446
Trust me. It doesn't work.

90
00:04:07,617 --> 00:04:10,177
You're not talking that Michigan
deposit-bottle scam?

91
00:04:10,337 --> 00:04:12,328
- No, I'm off that.
- You tried it?

92
00:04:12,497 --> 00:04:14,886
Oh, yeah. Every which way.
Couldn't crunch the numbers.

93
00:04:15,057 --> 00:04:16,729
It drove me crazy.

94
00:04:18,897 --> 00:04:20,330
You keep an eye on each other?

95
00:04:20,497 --> 00:04:21,850
- No problem.
- You bet.

96
00:04:29,417 --> 00:04:32,250
Are you sure you didn't hear
my car making a funny noise?

97
00:04:32,417 --> 00:04:34,294
I know those two idiots did
something to it.

98
00:04:34,457 --> 00:04:36,891
No, I didn't hear anything.

99
00:04:37,537 --> 00:04:40,256
Oh, my God. Look who's here.

100
00:04:40,417 --> 00:04:45,935
Sue Ellen Mischke, the braless,
Oh Henry! Candy bar heiress.

101
00:04:47,337 --> 00:04:51,091
Well, hello, Elaine, Jerry.

102
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:53,009
- Hi, Sue Ellen.
- Hi, Sue Ellen.

103
00:04:53,177 --> 00:04:54,690
I'm surprised to see you here.

104
00:04:54,857 --> 00:04:56,848
Come to catch a glimpse
of high society?

105
00:05:00,297 --> 00:05:03,653
No, no, I'm actually here to bid,
Sue Ellen.

106
00:05:03,817 --> 00:05:05,648
I mean,
that is if anything's to my liking.

107
00:05:06,177 --> 00:05:09,965
I'm here to catch
a glimpse of high society.

108
00:05:10,137 --> 00:05:12,731
Well, I hope you find something
that fits your budget.

109
00:05:15,137 --> 00:05:16,809
I hate that woman.

110
00:05:21,257 --> 00:05:22,246
I don't understand.

111
00:05:23,257 --> 00:05:24,485
You fill an 18-wheeler.

112
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,296
No, an 18-wheeler's no good.
Too much overhead.

113
00:05:27,457 --> 00:05:29,687
You got permits,
weigh stations, tolls.

114
00:05:29,857 --> 00:05:31,688
Look, you're way out of your league.

115
00:05:32,257 --> 00:05:33,815
I wanna learn.

116
00:05:33,977 --> 00:05:36,445
I want to know why.

117
00:05:42,497 --> 00:05:45,216
Oh, those are handsome.

118
00:05:45,377 --> 00:05:46,810
Look at that set.

119
00:05:46,977 --> 00:05:49,650
Yeah, think I might bid on those.

120
00:05:50,577 --> 00:05:52,408
Lot number 745.

121
00:05:52,577 --> 00:05:54,408
We have a full set of golf clubs...

122
00:05:54,577 --> 00:05:57,045
...that were owned
by President John F. Kennedy...

123
00:05:57,217 --> 00:06:01,051
...as seen in the famous photo of the
president chipping at Burning Tree...

124
00:06:01,217 --> 00:06:03,128
...on the morning
of the Bay of Pigs Invasion.

125
00:06:03,297 --> 00:06:08,894
The set is in perfect condition,
and we will start the biding at $4000.

126
00:06:09,057 --> 00:06:11,651
Four thousand dollars?
Do I have $4000? I have $4000.

127
00:06:11,817 --> 00:06:14,968
Do I have 5? Five thousand dollars?
I have $5000. Do I have 6?

128
00:06:15,217 --> 00:06:17,651
Six thousand dollars
for this set of beautiful clubs.

129
00:06:17,817 --> 00:06:21,332
Six? I have $6000.
Can I have 6500?

130
00:06:21,697 --> 00:06:25,451
Sixty-five hundred
to the dark-haired person on the right.

131
00:06:25,937 --> 00:06:29,293
We are at 6500.
Do I hear 6600?

132
00:06:29,457 --> 00:06:31,527
The president's own golf clubs.

133
00:06:31,697 --> 00:06:33,449
Leisure life at Camelot.

134
00:06:33,617 --> 00:06:35,289
Sixty-five hundred going once.

135
00:06:35,617 --> 00:06:36,766
Eight thousand.

136
00:06:36,937 --> 00:06:41,613
Eight thousand. We have 8000.
The bid is now $8000.

137
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:43,290
What is she doing?

138
00:06:43,457 --> 00:06:46,096
She's starting in on the biding now?

139
00:06:46,257 --> 00:06:47,610
Eighty-five hundred.

140
00:06:47,777 --> 00:06:50,337
- We have 85.
- Nine thousand.

141
00:06:50,497 --> 00:06:52,169
Nine thousand dollars.

142
00:06:52,337 --> 00:06:53,531
I think she wants those clubs.

143
00:06:53,697 --> 00:06:56,052
Do I hear 95?
Ninety-five hundred.

144
00:06:56,217 --> 00:06:58,447
- Ninety-five hundred.
- Ten thousand.

145
00:06:59,217 --> 00:07:02,254
Ten thousand
to the shapely woman on the left.

146
00:07:04,417 --> 00:07:05,975
Ten thousand going once.

147
00:07:06,137 --> 00:07:08,651
- That's you're ceiling.
- Ten thousand going twice.

148
00:07:08,817 --> 00:07:11,047
- Eleven thousand.
- Twelve thousand.

149
00:07:11,457 --> 00:07:13,846
- Thirteen thousand.
- Fourteen thousand.

150
00:07:14,137 --> 00:07:16,492
Fifteen thousand.

151
00:07:20,057 --> 00:07:21,729
Peterman is gonna kill me.

152
00:07:21,897 --> 00:07:23,808
I really thought
you had her there at 17,000.

153
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:25,695
Why didn't you stop me?

154
00:07:25,857 --> 00:07:27,051
Do you hear this clunking?

155
00:07:29,057 --> 00:07:30,251
A little.

156
00:07:36,297 --> 00:07:39,209
Oh, you know what?
I'm gonna grab these from you later.

157
00:07:39,377 --> 00:07:41,845
You'll take care of them.
Okay? Okay.

158
00:07:42,017 --> 00:07:43,370
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

159
00:07:43,537 --> 00:07:46,097
- Alrighty. Bye.
- Bye.

160
00:07:48,257 --> 00:07:50,327
What is going on here?

161
00:07:51,177 --> 00:07:53,771
Oh, my God.

162
00:08:00,257 --> 00:08:03,567
Oh, you idiots!

163
00:08:05,217 --> 00:08:07,128
So we could put the bottles
in a U-Haul.

164
00:08:07,297 --> 00:08:09,686
- Go lean and mean.
- Newman, it's a dead end. Come on.

165
00:08:10,217 --> 00:08:11,411
- Hey, there he is.
- Hey.

166
00:08:11,577 --> 00:08:13,807
You put your groceries under
the hood of my car?

167
00:08:14,217 --> 00:08:15,889
Oh, that's right.
We forgot about those.

168
00:08:16,057 --> 00:08:17,649
That's where my missing soda is.

169
00:08:17,817 --> 00:08:19,967
And your crab legs?
And a thing of cheese?

170
00:08:20,137 --> 00:08:23,288
The AAA guy said I was close to
sucking a muffin down the carburettor.

171
00:08:23,457 --> 00:08:26,654
- What were you thinking?
- We ran out of space.

172
00:08:26,817 --> 00:08:29,285
Now I gotta take the car to Tony
and get it checked out.

173
00:08:29,457 --> 00:08:30,606
- He's good.
- He's real good.

174
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:32,608
But he's so obsessive
about the car.

175
00:08:32,777 --> 00:08:35,132
He makes me feel guilty about
everything wrong with it.

176
00:08:35,297 --> 00:08:38,016
I gotta get it washed before
I take it down or he'll yell at me.

177
00:08:38,337 --> 00:08:41,374
- Choke?
- No, thank you.

178
00:08:41,937 --> 00:08:44,007
Oh, yeah.

179
00:08:44,177 --> 00:08:48,375
I remember this car. Beautiful car.

180
00:08:48,537 --> 00:08:51,370
Yeah, so anyway, the engine's been
idling a little rough.

181
00:08:51,537 --> 00:08:54,734
I thought it might be time
for a check-up.

182
00:08:54,897 --> 00:08:56,649
There's nothing wrong on the inside.

183
00:08:56,817 --> 00:08:58,808
The shift knob is loose.
You know about that?

184
00:08:58,977 --> 00:09:01,616
- No, I hadn't noticed.
- Have you been picking at it?

185
00:09:02,377 --> 00:09:03,526
Have I been picking at it?

186
00:09:04,137 --> 00:09:06,332
No, you know,
it's just wear and tear.

187
00:09:06,497 --> 00:09:08,806
Wear and tear, I see.

188
00:09:08,977 --> 00:09:11,047
The engine's the only thing
that needs checking.

189
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,287
- You been rotating the tires?
- Try to.

190
00:09:13,457 --> 00:09:14,890
You don't try to. You do it.

191
00:09:15,057 --> 00:09:17,173
Fifty-one percent of all turns
are right turns.

192
00:09:18,497 --> 00:09:20,010
That's right.

193
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,445
Twenty thousand dollars?

194
00:09:23,617 --> 00:09:26,051
Elaine, that's twice the amount
I authorized you to spend.

195
00:09:26,217 --> 00:09:28,526
I know, Mr. Peterman,
but once I saw them...

196
00:09:28,697 --> 00:09:31,609
...I just couldn't stand to let anyone
else have them, you know.

197
00:09:31,777 --> 00:09:33,813
Certainly not some
stuck-up candy-bar heiress...

198
00:09:33,977 --> 00:09:36,093
...who flaunts herself in public
without regard...

199
00:09:36,257 --> 00:09:38,293
Well, where are they?

200
00:09:38,817 --> 00:09:40,250
They should be here today.

201
00:09:48,657 --> 00:09:50,568
- Mr. Wilhelm.
- Yes, George.

202
00:09:51,417 --> 00:09:53,533
Hi, I was just...

203
00:09:53,697 --> 00:09:56,495
I just had one little question
about my assignment.

204
00:09:56,657 --> 00:09:58,375
Well, I trust things are
moving smoothly.

205
00:09:58,537 --> 00:10:00,050
Mr. Steinbrenner's counting on you.

206
00:10:00,377 --> 00:10:02,288
Yes, yes, very smooth,
super smooth.

207
00:10:02,457 --> 00:10:06,496
But I really want to attack this thing.
You know, sink my teeth into it.

208
00:10:06,657 --> 00:10:08,613
So I was just wondering...

209
00:10:08,777 --> 00:10:12,770
...what do you think would be
the very best way to get started?

210
00:10:12,937 --> 00:10:15,405
Get started?
I don't understand, George.

211
00:10:15,577 --> 00:10:17,772
- I was wondering...
- You haven't been to Payroll?

212
00:10:18,657 --> 00:10:20,807
- No, I haven't done that.
- What's the problem?

213
00:10:20,977 --> 00:10:23,935
Now, come on, George. I told
the big man you were moving on this.

214
00:10:24,097 --> 00:10:25,769
Now, don't let him down!

215
00:10:27,977 --> 00:10:29,649
Payroll!

216
00:10:37,377 --> 00:10:41,609
Hello there.
I'm George Costanza.

217
00:10:41,777 --> 00:10:42,812
Yes.

218
00:10:43,537 --> 00:10:46,005
Assistant to the travelling secretary.

219
00:10:46,177 --> 00:10:49,294
I'm working on the project.

220
00:10:50,497 --> 00:10:54,809
- What project?
- The payroll project.

221
00:10:54,977 --> 00:10:56,615
Wilhelm?

222
00:10:56,777 --> 00:10:59,132
Big, big payroll project.

223
00:10:59,297 --> 00:11:02,289
You're gonna have to fill me in.

224
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:06,008
You know what?
I'll look around for awhile.

225
00:11:06,177 --> 00:11:08,896
- I'll just browse around.
- Hey, wait. Excuse me.

226
00:11:09,057 --> 00:11:10,490
You can't come back here.

227
00:11:11,057 --> 00:11:12,888
I'm under direct orders
from Mr. Wilhelm.

228
00:11:13,057 --> 00:11:15,287
If you have a problem,
you just take it up with him.

229
00:11:15,937 --> 00:11:16,926
Well, maybe I will.

230
00:11:18,657 --> 00:11:21,376
You know what?
I urge you to take it up with him.

231
00:11:21,537 --> 00:11:22,811
Go ahead. Give him a call.

232
00:11:22,977 --> 00:11:25,411
He'll tell you what I'm doing here.
Then you can tell me.

233
00:11:25,577 --> 00:11:27,932
Mr. Wilhelm,
this is Lafarge in Payroll.

234
00:11:28,097 --> 00:11:32,329
There's a Costanza here,
says he's working on some project.

235
00:11:35,457 --> 00:11:40,690
Oh, I see. Interesting.
Well, that's quite a project.

236
00:11:41,257 --> 00:11:43,088
All right. Thank you.

237
00:11:45,017 --> 00:11:48,168
I'm sorry that I doubted you.

238
00:11:49,857 --> 00:11:52,530
Whatever you need,
just make yourself at home.

239
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:54,929
So he explained it all to you?

240
00:11:55,617 --> 00:11:57,926
Yes, he explained it all very clearly.

241
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:01,851
- What did he tell you?
- Look, you were right, I was wrong.

242
00:12:02,017 --> 00:12:03,928
You don't have
to humiliate me about it.

243
00:12:22,097 --> 00:12:23,655
Damn.

244
00:12:26,937 --> 00:12:29,497
Oh, Mother's Day.

245
00:12:30,297 --> 00:12:31,776
Wait a second.

246
00:12:31,937 --> 00:12:34,007
Mother's Day.

247
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,889
Yes!

248
00:13:01,297 --> 00:13:03,447
Come on, Kramer!

249
00:13:04,097 --> 00:13:06,372
- What?
- It's the truck, Kramer, the truck.

250
00:13:06,537 --> 00:13:08,448
Look, Newman,
I told you to let this thing go.

251
00:13:08,617 --> 00:13:09,845
No, no, no, listen to me.

252
00:13:10,017 --> 00:13:12,406
Most days, the post office sends
one truckload of mail...

253
00:13:12,577 --> 00:13:15,887
...to the second domestic regional
sorting facility in Saginaw, Michigan.

254
00:13:16,057 --> 00:13:19,049
But on the week before holidays,
we see a surge.

255
00:13:19,217 --> 00:13:20,855
On Valentine's Day,
we send two trucks.

256
00:13:21,017 --> 00:13:23,326
On Christmas, four,
packed to the brim.

257
00:13:23,497 --> 00:13:26,136
And tomorrow,
if history is any guide...

258
00:13:26,297 --> 00:13:29,528
...we'll see some spillover
into a fifth truck.

259
00:13:29,857 --> 00:13:34,009
- Mother's Day.
- The mother of all mail days.

260
00:13:34,177 --> 00:13:36,850
And guess who's signed up
for the truck?

261
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:39,248
A free truck?

262
00:13:39,417 --> 00:13:42,090
Oh, boy, that completely changes
our cost structure.

263
00:13:42,257 --> 00:13:44,213
Our G and A goes down 50 percent.

264
00:13:44,377 --> 00:13:46,652
We carry a couple of bags of mail,
the rest is ours!

265
00:13:46,817 --> 00:13:49,695
Newman, you magnificent bastard,
you did it!

266
00:13:49,857 --> 00:13:51,131
Let the collecting begin!

267
00:14:59,937 --> 00:15:02,656
So did you go down to Payroll?

268
00:15:02,817 --> 00:15:04,375
Yes, Payroll. Yes, I did.

269
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:06,971
Very productive. Payroll paid off.

270
00:15:07,137 --> 00:15:09,605
Then I guess
you'll be heading downtown, huh?

271
00:15:10,697 --> 00:15:14,531
Oh, yeah. Downtown, definitely.

272
00:15:14,697 --> 00:15:17,052
I'm very interested
to see how this thing turns out.

273
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:20,892
You said it. Excuse me, Mr. Wilhelm,
do you really think...?

274
00:15:21,057 --> 00:15:23,287
Well...

275
00:15:23,457 --> 00:15:28,577
Is this downtown trip really necessary,
you know, for the project?

276
00:15:28,737 --> 00:15:31,012
Oh, no, you've got
to go downtown, George.

277
00:15:31,177 --> 00:15:33,168
It's all downtown.

278
00:15:33,337 --> 00:15:36,329
- Just like the song says.
- The song?

279
00:15:36,817 --> 00:15:40,571
There's your answer, "Downtown."

280
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:46,888
The song "Downtown"?
The Petula Clark song?

281
00:15:47,057 --> 00:15:48,092
Yeah.

282
00:15:48,257 --> 00:15:51,135
You're sure he didn't mention it
because you were going downtown?

283
00:15:51,297 --> 00:15:54,494
I think he was trying to tell me
something, like it had some meaning.

284
00:15:55,137 --> 00:15:56,331
Okay, so how does it go?

285
00:15:56,937 --> 00:16:01,374
When you're alone
And life is making you lonely

286
00:16:01,537 --> 00:16:03,971
You can always go

287
00:16:05,217 --> 00:16:06,889
Downtown

288
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:11,011
Maybe you know
Some little places to go to

289
00:16:11,177 --> 00:16:13,008
Where they never close

290
00:16:14,017 --> 00:16:15,769
- Downtown
- Wait a second.

291
00:16:15,937 --> 00:16:18,895
Little places to go that never close.
What little place never closes?

292
00:16:19,777 --> 00:16:22,496
- 7-Eleven.
- Maybe.

293
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:28,445
Just listen to the music
Of the traffic in the city

294
00:16:28,617 --> 00:16:32,053
Linger on the sidewalk
Where the neon lights are pretty

295
00:16:32,217 --> 00:16:35,289
Where the neon lights are pretty.
The Broadway area?

296
00:16:35,457 --> 00:16:37,288
No, that's midtown.

297
00:16:37,457 --> 00:16:38,446
Midtown.

298
00:16:39,617 --> 00:16:42,768
The lights are much brighter there

299
00:16:42,937 --> 00:16:47,886
You can forget all your troubles
Forget all your cares

300
00:16:48,057 --> 00:16:49,285
Just go

301
00:16:49,457 --> 00:16:51,925
Downtown

302
00:16:52,097 --> 00:16:55,612
Things will be great
When you're

303
00:16:57,857 --> 00:16:59,495
Downtown

304
00:17:00,097 --> 00:17:02,657
I got nothing, Jerry, nothing.

305
00:17:02,977 --> 00:17:07,732
Well, don't hang around
and let your troubles surround you.

306
00:17:07,897 --> 00:17:09,694
There are movie shows.

307
00:17:10,577 --> 00:17:12,568
You think I should come clean?

308
00:17:12,737 --> 00:17:14,728
What do you think?
You think I should confess?

309
00:17:14,897 --> 00:17:16,774
How can you lose?

310
00:17:26,697 --> 00:17:29,609
Yeah, Jerry,
it's Tony Abado at the shop.

311
00:17:29,777 --> 00:17:31,574
Look, we gotta talk.
You better come down.

312
00:17:31,737 --> 00:17:33,853
Anytime after 4.

313
00:17:38,897 --> 00:17:40,216
- Hello.
- Hi, it's me.

314
00:17:40,377 --> 00:17:42,095
- Oh, hi.
- Listen, I need to come over...

315
00:17:42,257 --> 00:17:43,576
...and pick up the clubs.

316
00:17:43,737 --> 00:17:47,207
- Oh, you know what?
- Oh, no. What?

317
00:17:47,537 --> 00:17:49,653
No, it's no big deal.
I left the clubs in the car.

318
00:17:49,817 --> 00:17:52,012
You left them in the car?

319
00:17:52,177 --> 00:17:55,135
- How could you leave them in the car?
- I forgot.

320
00:17:55,297 --> 00:17:57,015
Oh, go down and get them.

321
00:17:57,177 --> 00:17:58,690
I can't.
The car's at the mechanic's.

322
00:17:58,897 --> 00:18:00,410
Oh, this is great.

323
00:18:00,577 --> 00:18:01,976
All right. Where's the mechanic?

324
00:18:02,137 --> 00:18:03,729
I'll just go and pick them up myself.

325
00:18:03,897 --> 00:18:06,127
No, no, you can't.
He's working on the car right now.

326
00:18:06,297 --> 00:18:08,652
You cannot disturb him
while he's working.

327
00:18:09,537 --> 00:18:12,051
I'm going there in an hour
if you wanna meet me there.

328
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:13,889
You know the place.
It's on 56th Street.

329
00:18:14,057 --> 00:18:17,049
Oh, okay. All right. Fine.

330
00:18:19,497 --> 00:18:20,896
Hey, Tony.

331
00:18:21,057 --> 00:18:23,571
- Thanks for coming in, Jerry.
- Sure.

332
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:28,374
I think I know what's going on here,
and I just want to hear it from you.

333
00:18:29,457 --> 00:18:31,493
But I want you
to be straight with me.

334
00:18:31,657 --> 00:18:33,329
Don't lie to me, Jerry.

335
00:18:34,217 --> 00:18:36,253
You know that motor oil
you're putting in there?

336
00:18:36,417 --> 00:18:38,328
It's from those
quickie- lube places, isn't it?

337
00:18:38,497 --> 00:18:43,173
- Well, I change it so often. I mean...
- Motor oil is the lifeblood of a car.

338
00:18:43,337 --> 00:18:46,249
You put in a low-grade oil,
you can damage vital engine parts.

339
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:49,853
Okay, see this gasket?
I have no confidence in that gasket.

340
00:18:50,017 --> 00:18:53,407
- Tony, I really don't...
- Here's what I wanna do.

341
00:18:53,577 --> 00:18:55,693
I wanna overhaul the entire engine.

342
00:18:55,857 --> 00:18:58,417
But it's gonna take
a major commitment from you.

343
00:18:58,577 --> 00:19:01,250
You're gonna have to keep it under
60 miles an hour for awhile.

344
00:19:01,417 --> 00:19:05,092
You gotta come in, and you gotta get
the oil changed every 1000 miles.

345
00:19:05,257 --> 00:19:06,975
How much money is
this gonna cost me?

346
00:19:09,537 --> 00:19:11,129
I don't understand you.

347
00:19:11,937 --> 00:19:13,655
It's your own car
we're talking about.

348
00:19:14,057 --> 00:19:16,412
You know, you wrote
the wrong mileage down on the form.

349
00:19:16,577 --> 00:19:17,566
You barely know the car.

350
00:19:17,737 --> 00:19:19,614
Don't know the mileage,
the tire pressure.

351
00:19:19,777 --> 00:19:21,847
When's the last time you checked
the washer fluid?

352
00:19:22,017 --> 00:19:24,736
- But the washer fluid is fine.
- The washer fluid is not fine!

353
00:19:27,297 --> 00:19:29,527
You know what...

354
00:19:29,897 --> 00:19:33,412
...I just wanna take my car and
I'm gonna bring it someplace else.

355
00:19:33,937 --> 00:19:36,656
- What do you mean?
- Just can I have my car.

356
00:19:36,817 --> 00:19:38,808
I'm gonna to pay my bill
and be on my way.

357
00:19:39,537 --> 00:19:42,005
- Well, the car's on a lift.
- Well, just get it down.

358
00:19:42,497 --> 00:19:43,930
All right.

359
00:19:44,497 --> 00:19:48,251
Okay. Well, wait here and I'll...
I'll bring it around.

360
00:19:48,417 --> 00:19:50,772
Okay. Thank you very much.

361
00:19:54,737 --> 00:19:56,648
Hey, where's the car?

362
00:19:56,817 --> 00:19:58,808
- He's bringing it.
- Good.

363
00:20:11,257 --> 00:20:12,656
Okay. Thank you.

364
00:20:12,817 --> 00:20:14,011
So, what did they say?

365
00:20:14,177 --> 00:20:16,213
They're sending
a detective tomorrow.

366
00:20:16,377 --> 00:20:18,971
What the hell were you thinking
leaving my clubs in that car?

367
00:20:19,137 --> 00:20:22,334
Well, I didn't count on my mechanic
pulling a Mary Beth Whitehead, did I?

368
00:20:22,497 --> 00:20:24,089
Well, what kind of maniac
is this guy?

369
00:20:24,257 --> 00:20:26,248
He's a very special maniac.

370
00:20:26,777 --> 00:20:29,337
- What do I tell Mr. Peterman?
- I don't know.

371
00:20:29,497 --> 00:20:32,409
Why couldn't
you take better care of that car?

372
00:20:33,537 --> 00:20:37,007
- Well, are they here?
- Mr. Peterman...

373
00:20:38,417 --> 00:20:40,567
...there seems to be a bit of a snag.

374
00:20:41,617 --> 00:20:42,732
Snag?

375
00:20:42,897 --> 00:20:47,209
It seems that
a psychotic mechanic...

376
00:20:47,377 --> 00:20:50,733
...has absconded
with my friend's car.

377
00:20:50,897 --> 00:20:52,569
What does that have
to do with my clubs?

378
00:20:52,737 --> 00:20:54,932
They happened to be
in the back seat at the time.

379
00:20:59,457 --> 00:21:01,891
What was the suspect wearing
at the time of the incident?

380
00:21:02,057 --> 00:21:06,653
You know, like mechanic's pants,
a shirt that said "Tony."

381
00:21:06,817 --> 00:21:09,206
Let me ask you,
have you ever seen a case like this?

382
00:21:09,377 --> 00:21:12,414
All the time. The mechanic forms
an emotional attachment...

383
00:21:12,577 --> 00:21:16,126
...thinks he's gonna lose the car.
He panics and does something rash.

384
00:21:16,577 --> 00:21:18,329
I'm gonna ask you
some personal questions.

385
00:21:18,497 --> 00:21:21,534
I'm sorry if I touch a nerve,
but I think it will help with the case.

386
00:21:22,057 --> 00:21:24,617
Had you been
taking good care of the car?

387
00:21:24,777 --> 00:21:26,813
- Had I been taking...?
- Did you leave the AC on?

388
00:21:26,977 --> 00:21:30,447
Do you zip over speed bumps?
Ride the clutch? Things like that?

389
00:21:30,617 --> 00:21:34,326
What does it matter? It's my car.
I can do whatever I want with it.

390
00:21:35,137 --> 00:21:38,015
Not that I would think
of doing such things.

391
00:21:38,177 --> 00:21:41,886
All right, Mr. Seinfeld,
we'll let you know if we find anything.

392
00:21:42,057 --> 00:21:43,775
I gotta be honest with you.

393
00:21:43,937 --> 00:21:45,529
These cases never end up well.

394
00:21:46,297 --> 00:21:48,857
Well, whatever you can do.
Thanks.

395
00:21:53,177 --> 00:21:55,532
Mr. Wilhelm, about the project, sir.

396
00:21:55,697 --> 00:21:57,176
That's what I came to talk about.

397
00:21:57,337 --> 00:22:00,409
Great job, George.
You really nailed it.

398
00:22:01,537 --> 00:22:03,653
- I did?
- Yes, I read through it this morning.

399
00:22:03,817 --> 00:22:07,605
I couldn't have done it better myself.
I turned it over to Mr. Steinbrenner.

400
00:22:07,777 --> 00:22:09,210
Good work, George.

401
00:22:12,217 --> 00:22:13,206
I don't get it.

402
00:22:13,377 --> 00:22:15,937
He assigns it to you,
you don't do it...

403
00:22:16,097 --> 00:22:17,371
...somehow it gets done...

404
00:22:17,537 --> 00:22:19,812
...and now he's telling you
what a great job you did.

405
00:22:19,977 --> 00:22:22,491
Maybe somebody did it
and didn't take credit for it.

406
00:22:22,657 --> 00:22:25,694
Maybe it was already done and
didn't need doing in the first place.

407
00:22:26,017 --> 00:22:28,577
I have no idea who did it...

408
00:22:28,737 --> 00:22:31,126
...what they did,
or how they did it so well.

409
00:22:31,297 --> 00:22:32,491
And you know what?

410
00:22:32,657 --> 00:22:35,569
Jimmy crack corn and I don't care.

411
00:22:36,657 --> 00:22:39,933
The gardener did a nice job planting
the rose bushes, didn't he, dear?

412
00:22:40,097 --> 00:22:42,975
You planted the rose bushes, dear.

413
00:22:44,337 --> 00:22:47,807
- I did?
- Yesterday. You remember.

414
00:22:47,977 --> 00:22:49,649
That's right.

415
00:22:51,057 --> 00:22:53,571
- Oh, what's for dinner?
- We just ate.

416
00:22:53,737 --> 00:22:56,649
Did you forget
to take your medicine?

417
00:22:59,897 --> 00:23:02,457
The point is,
however it got done, it's done.

418
00:23:02,617 --> 00:23:04,847
So any luck with the car?

419
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:06,245
No, the police have no leads.

420
00:23:06,417 --> 00:23:08,851
And I just found out today
my insurance doesn't cover it.

421
00:23:09,017 --> 00:23:10,814
- Why not?
- They don't consider it stolen...

422
00:23:10,977 --> 00:23:13,047
...if you wilfully
give the guy the keys.

423
00:23:14,057 --> 00:23:15,536
- Hey.
- Hey.

424
00:23:15,697 --> 00:23:16,891
What did the detective say?

425
00:23:18,097 --> 00:23:19,689
They're looking.

426
00:23:20,017 --> 00:23:21,211
I gotta go.

427
00:23:23,377 --> 00:23:24,696
- Hello.
- Mr. Seinfeld?

428
00:23:24,857 --> 00:23:26,654
- Yeah.
- It's Detective McMahon.

429
00:23:26,817 --> 00:23:29,695
I'm at the warehouse on pier 38.

430
00:23:30,657 --> 00:23:32,295
I think you'd better get down here.

431
00:23:32,457 --> 00:23:34,493
Yeah, okay.
They may have found the car.

432
00:23:35,017 --> 00:23:36,336
Are the clubs in it? Ask him.

433
00:23:36,497 --> 00:23:38,089
Are there golf clubs in the back?

434
00:23:38,257 --> 00:23:40,407
We really can't tell.

435
00:23:40,737 --> 00:23:43,410
You better bring
your service records.

436
00:23:47,377 --> 00:23:48,730
Watch where you step.

437
00:23:48,897 --> 00:23:52,412
There's quite a bit of grease.

438
00:23:52,577 --> 00:23:54,169
Detective, Jerry Seinfeld is here.

439
00:23:55,137 --> 00:23:56,729
How do you do?
Thanks for coming down.

440
00:23:56,897 --> 00:23:58,535
This is Elaine Benes.

441
00:23:58,697 --> 00:24:00,733
We used to date
but now we're just friends.

442
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:02,569
- I see.
- You know.

443
00:24:03,257 --> 00:24:05,976
I'm sorry to make you go through this,
but we need to make sure.

444
00:24:06,137 --> 00:24:07,729
What's going on?
What is this thing?

445
00:24:07,897 --> 00:24:10,934
One of our patrolmen
stumbled over this.

446
00:24:11,097 --> 00:24:12,246
Oh, my God.

447
00:24:12,697 --> 00:24:14,813
The block is nearly split apart.

448
00:24:14,977 --> 00:24:17,650
We found the overhead cams
30 feet away.

449
00:24:17,817 --> 00:24:19,853
We can only hope
the body's sold for scrap.

450
00:24:20,177 --> 00:24:21,610
Oh, my God.

451
00:24:21,857 --> 00:24:23,256
And we know it's a Saab.

452
00:24:23,417 --> 00:24:26,773
The angle on the V6
is definitely a '92.

453
00:24:26,937 --> 00:24:30,896
The model is hard to determine
because the drive train is all burnt out.

454
00:24:31,097 --> 00:24:33,008
What is that smell?

455
00:24:33,177 --> 00:24:34,815
Look at the clutch.

456
00:24:34,977 --> 00:24:36,569
Excuse me.

457
00:24:37,377 --> 00:24:40,050
Whoever did this
didn't just dismantle it.

458
00:24:40,217 --> 00:24:42,651
I mean, they took their time,
they had fun...

459
00:24:42,817 --> 00:24:44,409
...they were very systematic.

460
00:24:44,577 --> 00:24:47,137
They went out of the way
to gouge the sides of every piston.

461
00:24:47,297 --> 00:24:49,686
And the turbo was separated
from the housing...

462
00:24:49,857 --> 00:24:52,576
...and shoved right up
the exhaust pipe.

463
00:24:53,337 --> 00:24:54,895
Wait a second. Turbo?

464
00:24:55,057 --> 00:24:57,617
- I didn't have a turbo.
- Your car is not a turbo?

465
00:24:57,777 --> 00:24:59,927
No, it's a 900 S.

466
00:25:00,257 --> 00:25:02,452
It's a turbo, Elaine. A turbo.

467
00:25:02,617 --> 00:25:04,096
It's a turbo!

468
00:25:06,497 --> 00:25:08,010
Excuse me.
Did you say "Turbo"?

469
00:25:09,777 --> 00:25:12,086
Saab Turbo 9000?

470
00:25:12,417 --> 00:25:14,772
Is it midnight blue?

471
00:25:15,497 --> 00:25:17,089
Yes, ma'am.

472
00:25:19,097 --> 00:25:22,646
9999 bottles and cans in the truck

473
00:25:22,817 --> 00:25:25,695
9999 bottles and cans

474
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:30,533
At $0. 10 a bottle and $0. 10 a can
We're pulling in $500 a man

475
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:33,928
9998 bottles and cans in the truck

476
00:25:34,097 --> 00:25:37,055
9998 bottles and cans

477
00:25:37,217 --> 00:25:39,651
We fill up with gas
We count up our cash

478
00:25:39,817 --> 00:25:44,368
9997 bottles and cans in the truck

479
00:25:50,217 --> 00:25:53,050
- Hello.
- Hey, Jerry. It's Tony.

480
00:25:53,497 --> 00:25:54,646
Tony, where are you?

481
00:25:54,817 --> 00:25:57,377
Oh, look, I just want you to know
that the car is fine.

482
00:25:57,537 --> 00:25:58,731
Got her all fixed up.

483
00:25:58,897 --> 00:26:01,934
We're in a nice area,
no potholes, no traffic.

484
00:26:02,097 --> 00:26:04,088
So there's nothing
to worry about, okay?

485
00:26:04,257 --> 00:26:05,576
In fact, here.

486
00:26:05,737 --> 00:26:07,932
Somebody wants to talk to you.

487
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:13,211
Tony, you better
bring that car back.

488
00:26:13,377 --> 00:26:14,890
Nobody's giving anything back.

489
00:26:15,057 --> 00:26:16,331
You tried to take it from me.

490
00:26:16,497 --> 00:26:17,691
I don't forget that.

491
00:26:17,857 --> 00:26:20,325
Tony, it is my car,
and I want it back.

492
00:26:20,497 --> 00:26:22,772
Oh, your car?
You want your car back?

493
00:26:22,977 --> 00:26:24,410
- Tony...
- Listen.

494
00:26:24,577 --> 00:26:26,807
That registration may have
your name on it, Jerry...

495
00:26:26,977 --> 00:26:30,811
...but this engine's running
on my sweat and my blood.

496
00:26:33,737 --> 00:26:35,932
Where do I find these guys?

497
00:26:40,897 --> 00:26:44,731
- How much gas we got?
- Three quarters of a tank.

498
00:26:46,177 --> 00:26:47,451
Better than we estimated.

499
00:26:48,097 --> 00:26:52,887
- Seven dollars and 22 cents better.
- Oh, baby.

500
00:26:53,057 --> 00:26:56,766
- Maybe we could stop for a snack.
- No, that's not in the budget.

501
00:26:57,137 --> 00:27:00,686
Well, the budget changed, you know.
I mean, it might be a good investment.

502
00:27:00,857 --> 00:27:03,371
That's not a good investment.
That's a loss.

503
00:27:05,297 --> 00:27:06,730
Hey, you see that car?

504
00:27:07,457 --> 00:27:09,413
It looks like Jerry's.

505
00:27:09,577 --> 00:27:11,613
I'm gonna check out
that license plate.

506
00:27:13,777 --> 00:27:15,449
Yeah, those are New York plates.

507
00:27:15,617 --> 00:27:17,448
- Is that Jerry's number?
- I don't know.

508
00:27:17,617 --> 00:27:21,371
But that's New York and we're in Ohio.
Those are pretty good odds.

509
00:27:21,537 --> 00:27:23,050
- What are you doing?
- Calling Jerry.

510
00:27:23,217 --> 00:27:26,334
- On what?
- I brought my phone.

511
00:27:30,057 --> 00:27:31,285
- Hello.
- Hey, Jerry.

512
00:27:31,457 --> 00:27:33,527
- What's your license plate number?
- What's up?

513
00:27:33,697 --> 00:27:35,335
Yeah, well,
I think I spotted your car.

514
00:27:35,497 --> 00:27:38,489
Oh, my God, you're kidding.
Hang on a second.

515
00:27:39,137 --> 00:27:42,493
- It's JVN728.
- Hey, that's it.

516
00:27:42,657 --> 00:27:44,727
That's it.
Hey, look, we got him.

517
00:27:44,897 --> 00:27:46,455
We're driving behind him
in a truck.

518
00:27:46,617 --> 00:27:49,131
Oh, my God. Yeah.
He said he brought it to the country.

519
00:27:49,297 --> 00:27:51,413
We're in the country,
and we're right on his tail.

520
00:27:51,577 --> 00:27:53,329
Good work, Kramer.
This is incredible.

521
00:27:53,497 --> 00:27:54,646
Yeah, don't worry, Jerry.

522
00:27:54,817 --> 00:27:57,570
We're right on this guy
like stink on a monkey.

523
00:27:57,737 --> 00:27:59,568
I'll check back with you.

524
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:02,331
Elaine Benes.

525
00:28:02,497 --> 00:28:04,215
Yeah, it's me.
Kramer found the car.

526
00:28:04,697 --> 00:28:05,971
Oh, my God. Where is it?

527
00:28:06,137 --> 00:28:08,093
Somewhere in the country.
They're following him.

528
00:28:08,537 --> 00:28:10,732
- The clubs there?
- I don't know. They're tailing him.

529
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:14,253
- I'm waiting for them to call me back.
- All right. I'm heading over right now.

530
00:28:17,937 --> 00:28:20,405
- What's the status?
- Last check-in, they were still on him.

531
00:28:20,817 --> 00:28:22,170
Have they called the police yet?

532
00:28:22,337 --> 00:28:24,373
- They won't call the police.
- What? Why not?

533
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:26,334
They'll get in trouble
for using the truck.

534
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:28,567
- Kramer doesn't want a record.
- Kramer has one.

535
00:28:28,737 --> 00:28:30,090
Not a federal record.

536
00:28:33,497 --> 00:28:34,486
- Kramer?
- Kramer?

537
00:28:34,657 --> 00:28:36,010
- What's going on?
- Yeah, nothing.

538
00:28:36,177 --> 00:28:37,371
We're still following him.

539
00:28:38,897 --> 00:28:41,047
Wait a second. He's getting off.

540
00:28:41,217 --> 00:28:43,526
Yeah, he's gonna be going south
on the 135.

541
00:28:43,697 --> 00:28:46,131
- Keep following him.
- All right. I'll follow him.

542
00:28:46,297 --> 00:28:47,935
We can't.
We're going north to Michigan.

543
00:28:48,337 --> 00:28:51,534
Yeah, hey, listen, I can't.
It's gonna be taking us out of our way.

544
00:28:51,737 --> 00:28:54,331
- I need those clubs.
- Kramer, I want my car.

545
00:28:54,497 --> 00:28:57,409
- Well, I don't know what to do!
- We got 10,000 deposit bottles here.

546
00:28:57,577 --> 00:28:59,215
This guy could be going
to Arkansas.

547
00:28:59,417 --> 00:29:00,896
Keep following.
Don't let me down.

548
00:29:01,057 --> 00:29:03,935
We can't afford a detour.
Our budget won't hold it.

549
00:29:04,097 --> 00:29:05,496
I don't know what to do, man!

550
00:29:05,657 --> 00:29:08,091
Stay left! Stay left!
Left, left, left. Stay left!

551
00:29:08,257 --> 00:29:09,610
- Right! Go right!
- Go south!

552
00:29:09,777 --> 00:29:12,610
All right, all right. I'm getting off.
I'm gonna go on the ramp.

553
00:29:12,777 --> 00:29:14,449
I hope you realize
what you've done.

554
00:29:14,617 --> 00:29:16,494
You've destroyed
our whole venture.

555
00:29:16,657 --> 00:29:18,170
This ramp is steep.

556
00:29:18,337 --> 00:29:21,534
All my work, my planning, my genius,
all for naught.

557
00:29:21,697 --> 00:29:23,050
We're pulling too much weight.

558
00:29:23,217 --> 00:29:25,811
- He's getting away. Take the wheel.
- Hey, what are you doing?

559
00:29:25,977 --> 00:29:28,616
- I'm gonna get something.
- Are you crazy?

560
00:29:29,537 --> 00:29:31,209
Keep your foot on the gas.

561
00:29:33,217 --> 00:29:35,856
Hey, you're not dumping those
bottles back there, are you?

562
00:29:38,657 --> 00:29:42,969
Kramer, those have wholesale value.
We can cut our losses.

563
00:29:43,137 --> 00:29:45,571
Bottles below!

564
00:29:53,537 --> 00:29:56,335
I love this magnifying glass.
I feel like a scientist.

565
00:29:56,497 --> 00:29:58,772
- Oh, yeah.
- You wanted to see me, sir?

566
00:29:59,337 --> 00:30:01,328
Come in, George. Come in.

567
00:30:01,497 --> 00:30:04,773
Wilhelm gave me
this project you worked on.

568
00:30:04,937 --> 00:30:06,575
- Yes, sir.
- Let me ask you something.

569
00:30:06,737 --> 00:30:09,535
Having any personal problems?
Girl trouble? Love trouble?

570
00:30:10,457 --> 00:30:12,049
- No, sir.
- What about drugs?

571
00:30:12,217 --> 00:30:14,333
Doing some of that crack cocaine?
You on the pipe?

572
00:30:15,457 --> 00:30:17,448
- No, sir.
- Are you seeing a psychiatrist?

573
00:30:17,617 --> 00:30:20,256
I got a flash for you, young man.
You're non compos mentis.

574
00:30:20,417 --> 00:30:22,135
You got some bats in the belfry.

575
00:30:23,377 --> 00:30:24,605
What are you talking about?

576
00:30:24,817 --> 00:30:27,615
George, I read this report.
It's troubling. Very troubling indeed.

577
00:30:27,777 --> 00:30:30,166
It's a sick mind at work here.
Okay, come on, boys.

578
00:30:30,337 --> 00:30:32,134
Come in here.
George, this is Herb and Dan.

579
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:34,606
They're gonna take you
to where you can get some help.

580
00:30:34,777 --> 00:30:37,211
Very friendly people there.
My brother- in-law was there.

581
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:38,969
Man was obsessed
with lactating women.

582
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:41,207
They cured him.
Although he eats a lot of cheese.

583
00:30:42,217 --> 00:30:45,289
But you see... You see, I didn't
write that report. That's not mine.

584
00:30:45,457 --> 00:30:47,288
Of course you didn't.
You didn't write it.

585
00:30:47,457 --> 00:30:49,732
I didn't do it! It just got done!

586
00:30:49,897 --> 00:30:52,252
I don't know how it got done
but it did!

587
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:53,532
Of course, it got done.

588
00:30:53,697 --> 00:30:55,813
Things get done all the time.
I understand.

589
00:30:55,977 --> 00:30:58,332
Your job will be waiting for you
when you get back.

590
00:30:58,497 --> 00:31:01,455
Get better, George!
Get better!

591
00:31:06,537 --> 00:31:08,368
Man, I don't understand this.

592
00:31:08,537 --> 00:31:11,290
I ditched every bottle and can,
and we still can't gain.

593
00:31:11,457 --> 00:31:13,049
It's like we're...

594
00:31:14,017 --> 00:31:15,609
...sluggish.

595
00:31:15,777 --> 00:31:19,486
We collected all those bottles and
all those cans for what? What a waste.

596
00:31:19,657 --> 00:31:22,251
I'm really gonna catch hell
for those missing mailbags.

597
00:31:22,617 --> 00:31:25,609
Hey, wasn't that a pie stand
back there?

598
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,616
- A pie stand?
- Oh, yeah.

599
00:31:27,777 --> 00:31:29,608
Homemade pies, 200 yards back.

600
00:31:29,777 --> 00:31:31,893
Oh, come on, pull over.
Pull over, will you?

601
00:31:36,977 --> 00:31:38,171
Where? I don't see it.

602
00:31:38,337 --> 00:31:41,215
Well, open the door.
You'll get a better look.

603
00:31:41,377 --> 00:31:43,049
I don't see any pie.

604
00:31:45,257 --> 00:31:46,451
Kramer!

605
00:31:46,617 --> 00:31:49,848
I'm sorry, Newman,
you were holding us back.

606
00:31:50,017 --> 00:31:51,575
Kramer!

607
00:31:54,497 --> 00:31:57,933
Jerry, we've lost the fat man
and we're running lean.

608
00:31:58,097 --> 00:32:00,088
We're back on track, buddy.

609
00:32:02,177 --> 00:32:04,088
Federal employee.

610
00:32:19,497 --> 00:32:21,169
I hate corn.

611
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:01,816
- Hello, stranger.
- Look, I'm sorry to bother you...

612
00:33:01,977 --> 00:33:03,456
...but I'm a U.S. Postal worker...

613
00:33:03,617 --> 00:33:05,528
...and my mail truck
was just ambushed...

614
00:33:05,697 --> 00:33:08,575
...by a band of backwoods,
mail-hating survivalists.

615
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:10,250
You just calm down now.
Calm down.

616
00:33:10,417 --> 00:33:12,089
Don't worry. We'll take care of you.

617
00:33:12,257 --> 00:33:15,454
This farm ain't much,
but you're welcome to what we have.

618
00:33:15,617 --> 00:33:20,008
- Hot bath, hearty meal, clean bed.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

619
00:33:20,177 --> 00:33:21,656
I just have one rule.

620
00:33:21,817 --> 00:33:24,012
Keep your hands off my daughter.

621
00:33:30,697 --> 00:33:33,336
Jerry, we got him.
I'm riding his tail.

622
00:33:33,497 --> 00:33:36,091
There's no escape.
He's running scared, buddy.

623
00:33:36,257 --> 00:33:39,135
- How's the gas situation?
- I got enough to get to Memphis.

624
00:33:39,857 --> 00:33:41,176
He's reaching in back.

625
00:33:41,337 --> 00:33:44,090
Keeps grabbing at something.
He's pulling out a gun.

626
00:33:44,257 --> 00:33:46,452
- He's got a gun, Jerry!
- Duck, Kramer, duck.

627
00:33:49,657 --> 00:33:51,648
It's a golf club. There's no gun.

628
00:33:51,817 --> 00:33:53,933
He threw a golf club at me!

629
00:33:54,097 --> 00:33:55,849
Those are JFK's golf clubs.

630
00:33:59,017 --> 00:34:00,245
Hey, I'm under fire.

631
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:03,453
I'm under heavy fire here.

632
00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:07,408
Jeez, there goes a five- iron.

633
00:34:07,617 --> 00:34:09,369
Stop the truck, Kramer.
Pick up the clubs.

634
00:34:09,537 --> 00:34:12,256
No, don't stop, Kramer.
Keep going. Don't let him get away.

635
00:34:12,497 --> 00:34:14,692
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I think he's done.

636
00:34:14,857 --> 00:34:16,654
Oh, no, he's taking out the woods!

637
00:34:23,457 --> 00:34:25,607
You'll have to do
a lot better than that!

638
00:34:31,297 --> 00:34:33,049
What's happening?

639
00:34:33,377 --> 00:34:36,255
This truck is dying.
We're losing him.

640
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:52,249
- I think we lost him.
- Damn it.

641
00:34:52,417 --> 00:34:54,328
Can you stop
and pick up those clubs, Kramer?

642
00:34:54,657 --> 00:34:56,773
Yeah, yeah, I'll get them.

643
00:35:36,577 --> 00:35:38,374
Enjoying that mutton?

644
00:35:38,977 --> 00:35:40,171
It's delicious mutton.

645
00:35:40,337 --> 00:35:43,056
This is... This is out of sight.

646
00:35:43,217 --> 00:35:47,256
I would... I would love to get the recipe.
It's very good.

647
00:36:00,897 --> 00:36:02,296
That cider too strong for you?

648
00:36:02,457 --> 00:36:05,654
No, no, I love strong cider.

649
00:36:05,817 --> 00:36:09,696
I'm a big strong-cider guy.

650
00:36:11,017 --> 00:36:13,690
Gonna milk the Holsteins
in the morning, if you'd lend a hand.

651
00:36:14,817 --> 00:36:17,536
You know, I don't know much about...
I don't have any...

652
00:36:17,697 --> 00:36:20,257
- I don't think I know much about that.
- Susie will teach you.

653
00:36:21,017 --> 00:36:22,928
Just gotta pull on the teets a little.

654
00:36:25,697 --> 00:36:29,815
It's nice having
a big, strong man around.

655
00:36:32,577 --> 00:36:34,772
You know, those mailbags,
they get mighty heavy.

656
00:36:35,297 --> 00:36:36,571
I...

657
00:36:36,737 --> 00:36:38,807
I Nautilus, of course.

658
00:36:43,297 --> 00:36:45,094
Can I have some gravy?

659
00:36:49,177 --> 00:36:51,930
Steinbrenner had me committed!
I'm in the nuthouse.

660
00:36:52,097 --> 00:36:54,008
I'll be back
same time next week, Pop.

661
00:36:54,177 --> 00:36:55,815
They took my belt, Jerry.

662
00:36:55,977 --> 00:36:57,456
I got nothing to hold my pants up.

663
00:36:58,337 --> 00:37:00,248
You gotta come over here now!

664
00:37:00,417 --> 00:37:03,375
Just tell him what we talked about,
how I didn't do the project.

665
00:37:03,537 --> 00:37:05,050
George?

666
00:37:06,497 --> 00:37:08,249
I see you're finally
getting some help.

667
00:37:08,417 --> 00:37:12,410
Oh, Deena, thank God.
Thank God, you're here.

668
00:37:12,577 --> 00:37:13,851
Listen, you gotta help me.

669
00:37:14,017 --> 00:37:15,894
You gotta tell these people
that I'm okay.

670
00:37:16,057 --> 00:37:18,332
You know
that I don't belong in here.

671
00:37:18,937 --> 00:37:21,849
George, this is
the best thing for you.

672
00:37:23,897 --> 00:37:27,048
What? No, no, Deena.
Deena, wait! Deena, help!

673
00:37:27,217 --> 00:37:28,411
It's not what it looks like.

674
00:37:28,577 --> 00:37:30,533
Is that little Georgie C?

675
00:37:31,377 --> 00:37:32,969
How's the folks?

676
00:37:33,137 --> 00:37:35,446
You still got that nice little car?

677
00:37:58,017 --> 00:38:00,247
- What are you doing?
- Kramer, help me, help me!

678
00:38:02,417 --> 00:38:04,328
I told you to keep away
from my daughter.

679
00:38:07,617 --> 00:38:09,289
No, Daddy, you'll hurt him.

680
00:38:09,457 --> 00:38:11,129
I love him.

681
00:38:11,297 --> 00:38:15,609
Goodbye, Norman! Goodbye!

682
00:38:23,577 --> 00:38:26,045
Elaine, you found the clubs.
That's wonderful news.

683
00:38:26,217 --> 00:38:28,333
- Where are they?
- Yep.

684
00:38:28,737 --> 00:38:30,489
Let me get them for you,
Mr. Peterman.

685
00:38:30,657 --> 00:38:34,013
I'll be inaugurating them this weekend
with none other than Ethel Kennedy.

686
00:38:34,897 --> 00:38:36,888
A woman whose triumph
in the face of tragedy...

687
00:38:37,057 --> 00:38:40,413
...is exceeded only
by her proclivity to procreate.

688
00:38:53,657 --> 00:38:54,976
The...

689
00:38:55,537 --> 00:38:59,576
The letter of authenticity
is in the side pocket there.

690
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:01,170
Elaine.

691
00:39:02,777 --> 00:39:05,007
I never knew Kennedy
had such a temper.

692
00:39:09,377 --> 00:39:10,969
Oh, yeah.

693
00:39:11,817 --> 00:39:14,490
The only thing worse was his slice.

694
00:39:17,337 --> 00:39:20,647
- See you on Monday.
- Have a good game.
