1
00:00:06,886 --> 00:00:08,524
Well, you got no place to go.

2
00:00:11,126 --> 00:00:13,435
Your problem is you brought
your queen out too fast.

3
00:00:14,046 --> 00:00:17,516
What do you think, she's a feminist
looking to get out of the house?

4
00:00:18,006 --> 00:00:23,126
No, the queen is old-fashioned.
Likes to stay home, cook.

5
00:00:23,286 --> 00:00:25,675
Take care of her man.
Make sure he feels good.

6
00:00:28,886 --> 00:00:30,558
Checkmate.

7
00:00:38,086 --> 00:00:40,839
I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

8
00:00:56,046 --> 00:00:57,365
Shut up!

9
00:00:57,526 --> 00:01:02,998
Shut up, you stupid mutt!

10
00:01:04,326 --> 00:01:06,715
You broke up with her
because she beat you at chess?

11
00:01:06,886 --> 00:01:07,875
That's pretty sick.

12
00:01:08,046 --> 00:01:11,436
I don't see how I could perform
sexually after something like that.

13
00:01:11,646 --> 00:01:14,479
I was completely emasculated.

14
00:01:14,646 --> 00:01:16,204
Anyway, it's not the only reason.

15
00:01:16,366 --> 00:01:18,641
- Yeah, what else?
- All right.

16
00:01:18,806 --> 00:01:21,366
You wanna know what
one of her favourite expressions is:

17
00:01:21,526 --> 00:01:23,437
"Happy, pappy?"

18
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:25,679
"Happy, pappy?"
What does that mean?

19
00:01:25,846 --> 00:01:28,565
If she wants to know if I'm pleased
with something, she'll say:

20
00:01:28,726 --> 00:01:30,239
"Happy, pappy?"

21
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:32,394
- Oh, you're pappy.
- I'm pappy.

22
00:01:32,566 --> 00:01:35,126
- Oh, I get it. I see.
- Yeah.

23
00:01:35,646 --> 00:01:38,001
- So that's not so bad.
- Come on. What, are you kidding?

24
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:39,519
So tell her not to say it.

25
00:01:40,126 --> 00:01:42,924
I'm much more comfortable
criticizing people behind their backs.

26
00:01:44,566 --> 00:01:46,841
Look who's talking.
You just broke up with Melanie...

27
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:49,042
...because she shushed you
while you watched TV.

28
00:01:49,206 --> 00:01:51,766
Hey, I got a real thing
about shushing.

29
00:01:53,126 --> 00:01:54,525
What is this?

30
00:01:54,686 --> 00:01:58,235
You ever get the feeling like you had
a haircut, but you didn't have one?

31
00:01:58,406 --> 00:02:00,681
I'm all itchy back here.

32
00:02:05,446 --> 00:02:07,801
- What?
- What is this?

33
00:02:07,966 --> 00:02:09,285
What are we doing?

34
00:02:09,726 --> 00:02:11,762
What in God's name are we doing?

35
00:02:11,926 --> 00:02:14,599
- What?
- Our lives.

36
00:02:14,766 --> 00:02:16,757
What kind of lives are these?

37
00:02:16,926 --> 00:02:21,636
- We're like children. We're not men.
- No, we're not. We're not men.

38
00:02:21,806 --> 00:02:24,559
We come up with all these stupid
reasons to break up with women.

39
00:02:24,726 --> 00:02:26,956
I know, I know. That's what I do.
That's what I do.

40
00:02:28,246 --> 00:02:31,204
Are we gonna be sitting here
when we're 60, like two idiots?

41
00:02:31,366 --> 00:02:33,755
We should be having dinner
with our sons when we're 60.

42
00:02:33,926 --> 00:02:38,044
- We're pathetic, you know that?
- Like I don't know that I'm pathetic.

43
00:02:39,446 --> 00:02:41,755
- Why can't I be normal?
- Yes, me too.

44
00:02:41,926 --> 00:02:44,201
I wanna be normal. Normal!

45
00:02:44,366 --> 00:02:46,482
It would be nice
to care about someone.

46
00:02:46,646 --> 00:02:49,683
Yes. Yes, care.

47
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:56,236
You know who I think about a lot?

48
00:02:56,846 --> 00:02:59,360
Remember Susan,
the one that used to work for NBC?

49
00:02:59,526 --> 00:03:01,642
I thought she became a lesbian.

50
00:03:01,926 --> 00:03:03,598
No, it didn't take.

51
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:08,723
Did I tell you I ran into her last week?
She looked great.

52
00:03:08,886 --> 00:03:11,275
You thought she was
good-looking, right?

53
00:03:11,446 --> 00:03:14,165
See, there you go again.
What is the difference what I think?

54
00:03:14,326 --> 00:03:17,204
- I was just curious.
- Well, this is it.

55
00:03:17,366 --> 00:03:19,436
I'm really gonna do something
about my life.

56
00:03:19,606 --> 00:03:22,404
I think I'm gonna call Melanie again.
So what if she shushed me?

57
00:03:22,566 --> 00:03:25,000
George, I am really
gonna make some changes.

58
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:27,282
- Yes, changes.
- I'm serious about it.

59
00:03:27,446 --> 00:03:28,799
- Think I'm not?
- I'm not kidding.

60
00:03:28,966 --> 00:03:30,638
Me too.

61
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:34,157
Melanie, you can shush me
at every opportunity.

62
00:03:34,446 --> 00:03:36,482
So we're all straightened out?

63
00:03:36,646 --> 00:03:38,557
You happy, pappy?

64
00:03:40,886 --> 00:03:43,081
Oh, it's just an expression.

65
00:03:43,926 --> 00:03:47,999
All right. That's very sweet of you.
Okay, I'll call you later. All right. Bye.

66
00:03:48,326 --> 00:03:49,361
Hey.

67
00:03:49,526 --> 00:03:54,884
Well, I had a very interesting lunch
with George Costanza today.

68
00:03:55,046 --> 00:03:56,843
- Really?
- We were talking about our lives...

69
00:03:57,006 --> 00:03:59,315
...and we both kind of realized...

70
00:03:59,486 --> 00:04:01,681
...we're kids. We're not men.

71
00:04:01,846 --> 00:04:04,963
So then you asked yourselves,
"Isn't there something more to life?"

72
00:04:05,126 --> 00:04:07,117
Yes, we did.

73
00:04:07,286 --> 00:04:09,356
Yeah. Well, let me clue you in
on something:

74
00:04:09,526 --> 00:04:10,800
There isn't.

75
00:04:14,646 --> 00:04:17,114
- There isn't?
- Absolutely not.

76
00:04:17,286 --> 00:04:20,835
I mean, what are you thinking
about, Jerry? Marriage? Family?

77
00:04:21,486 --> 00:04:23,795
- Well-
- They're prisons.

78
00:04:23,966 --> 00:04:27,117
Man-made prisons. You're doing time.

79
00:04:27,286 --> 00:04:29,516
You get up in the morning,
she's there.

80
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,438
You go to sleep at night,
she's there.

81
00:04:31,606 --> 00:04:34,916
It's like you gotta ask permission
to use the bathroom.

82
00:04:35,086 --> 00:04:38,715
"Is it all right
if I use the bathroom now?"

83
00:04:39,006 --> 00:04:41,122
- Really?
- You can forget about watching TV...

84
00:04:41,286 --> 00:04:43,117
...while you're eating.

85
00:04:43,286 --> 00:04:46,005
- I can?
- Oh, yeah!

86
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:49,317
You know why?
Because it's dinnertime.

87
00:04:49,486 --> 00:04:51,397
- And you know what you do at dinner?
- What?

88
00:04:51,726 --> 00:04:53,842
You talk about your day.

89
00:04:54,006 --> 00:04:55,075
"How was your day today?

90
00:04:55,246 --> 00:04:57,999
Did you have a good day or
a bad day? What kind of day was it?"

91
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,999
"I don't know. How about you?
How was your day?"

92
00:05:01,446 --> 00:05:03,437
- Boy.
- It's sad, Jerry.

93
00:05:03,606 --> 00:05:05,324
It's a sad state of affairs.

94
00:05:05,646 --> 00:05:09,924
- I'm glad we had this talk.
- Oh, you have no idea.

95
00:05:44,086 --> 00:05:45,314
- Hey.
- Hey.

96
00:05:45,486 --> 00:05:48,159
Three hours of sleep again last night.

97
00:05:48,326 --> 00:05:51,602
Three hours of sleep
because of that dog.

98
00:05:51,966 --> 00:05:54,161
- What dog?
- Why don't you call the police?

99
00:05:54,326 --> 00:05:57,363
- I did, Jerry. They won't do anything.
- Yeah. What dog?

100
00:05:57,526 --> 00:06:01,280
There is this dog in the courtyard
across from my bedroom window...

101
00:06:01,446 --> 00:06:03,835
...that never, ever stops barking.

102
00:06:04,646 --> 00:06:07,365
I lost my voice
just screaming at this thing.

103
00:06:07,526 --> 00:06:09,994
I can't sleep. I can't work.

104
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,475
I mean, I just moved.
I can't move again.

105
00:06:12,646 --> 00:06:15,524
What am I gonna do? What?
What am I gonna do?

106
00:06:15,686 --> 00:06:19,156
- Well, there is something you can do.
- What? Kramer, I'll do anything.

107
00:06:19,326 --> 00:06:23,444
Well, what if there should be
an unfortunate accident?

108
00:06:25,526 --> 00:06:27,118
You're gonna rub out the dog?

109
00:06:28,646 --> 00:06:30,398
No, no. Not me.

110
00:06:30,566 --> 00:06:32,636
I just happen to know someone
who specializes...

111
00:06:32,806 --> 00:06:36,640
...in exactly these kinds
of sticky situations.

112
00:06:38,246 --> 00:06:39,998
What, you're considering this?

113
00:06:42,406 --> 00:06:45,478
Just meet with him. See what he has
to say. You got nothing to lose.

114
00:06:48,766 --> 00:06:52,759
I- I don't really know why I'm here.
Kramer talked me into coming here...

115
00:06:52,926 --> 00:06:55,520
...but obviously I could never
really do anything.

116
00:06:55,806 --> 00:06:57,603
Of course.

117
00:07:00,006 --> 00:07:01,200
Obviously.

118
00:07:01,446 --> 00:07:04,404
Well, so anyway,
I'm sorry for wasting your time.

119
00:07:04,566 --> 00:07:07,524
What kind of dog did you say it was?

120
00:07:08,726 --> 00:07:13,846
- I don't know. I've never really seen it.
- I see many dogs on my mail route.

121
00:07:14,006 --> 00:07:17,362
I'll bet there's not one type of mutt
or mongrel I haven't run across.

122
00:07:17,526 --> 00:07:21,075
If you ask me, they have no business
living amongst us. Vile, useless-

123
00:07:21,246 --> 00:07:23,760
Newman! Newman!

124
00:07:23,926 --> 00:07:25,439
Stop it.

125
00:07:26,326 --> 00:07:28,715
- Anyway.
- Yeah.

126
00:07:29,646 --> 00:07:31,398
Well, I was just curious...

127
00:07:31,566 --> 00:07:36,594
...if I were interested
in availing myself of your services...

128
00:07:36,766 --> 00:07:38,597
...what exactly would you do?

129
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:42,201
Well, Elaine...

130
00:07:43,006 --> 00:07:46,157
...there's any number of things
that I could do.

131
00:07:46,326 --> 00:07:48,476
But I can promise you this, though:

132
00:07:48,646 --> 00:07:51,922
This vicious beast
will never bother you again.

133
00:07:52,086 --> 00:07:53,280
So, what's it gonna be?

134
00:07:54,126 --> 00:07:56,162
No, I'm sorry. I can't hurt a dog.

135
00:07:56,326 --> 00:07:58,920
- I can't hurt a dog. I can't.
- Wait a minute. I got it.

136
00:07:59,086 --> 00:08:02,522
We'll kidnap it. We'll kidnap the dog,
we'll drop him off upstate.

137
00:08:02,686 --> 00:08:05,041
Then he won't bother you anymore
and he won't get hurt.

138
00:08:05,206 --> 00:08:07,515
Yeah, I suppose.

139
00:08:08,966 --> 00:08:11,844
I'd have to think about it.
I doubt it, though. I'll let you know.

140
00:08:12,006 --> 00:08:14,042
Of course, take your time.

141
00:08:14,206 --> 00:08:16,595
I'll be here.

142
00:09:10,526 --> 00:09:12,517
All right. Let's do it.

143
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,638
Excellent.

144
00:09:15,726 --> 00:09:17,557
Excellent.

145
00:09:25,926 --> 00:09:28,235
How come you eat your peas
one at a time?

146
00:09:28,406 --> 00:09:30,522
Well, what's the hurry?

147
00:09:39,326 --> 00:09:40,520
Who is it?

148
00:09:40,686 --> 00:09:42,563
- It's George.
- George?

149
00:09:44,566 --> 00:09:45,760
George, what is it?

150
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:50,355
Will you marry me?

151
00:09:57,086 --> 00:10:00,237
- Hello?
- Ma, guess what?

152
00:10:00,406 --> 00:10:03,762
- Oh, my God.
- No, it's nothing bad.

153
00:10:03,926 --> 00:10:06,121
- I'm getting married!
- You what?

154
00:10:06,286 --> 00:10:09,995
- I'm getting married!
- Oh, my God. You're getting married?

155
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,918
- Yes.
- Oh, I can't believe it.

156
00:10:12,086 --> 00:10:14,646
- Frank, come here.
- You come here.

157
00:10:14,806 --> 00:10:17,036
- Georgie's getting married.
- What?

158
00:10:17,206 --> 00:10:19,845
- Georgie's getting married!
- Get the hell out of here.

159
00:10:20,006 --> 00:10:21,325
- He's getting married?
- Yes.

160
00:10:21,486 --> 00:10:23,397
- To a woman?
- Of course a woman.

161
00:10:23,566 --> 00:10:24,715
What does she /ook /ik e?

162
00:10:24,886 --> 00:10:26,114
I'm sure she's gorgeous.

163
00:10:26,286 --> 00:10:28,720
- What differences does it make?
- Is she pretty?

164
00:10:28,886 --> 00:10:30,638
Yes. What difference does to make?

165
00:10:30,806 --> 00:10:32,080
I'm just curious!

166
00:10:32,246 --> 00:10:34,476
- She's not pretty?
- Let me talk to her.

167
00:10:34,646 --> 00:10:35,874
She wants to talk to you.

168
00:10:37,046 --> 00:10:40,516
- Hello?
- Congratulations.

169
00:10:40,686 --> 00:10:43,723
I just want you to know
that I love your son very much.

170
00:10:43,886 --> 00:10:45,035
- You do?
- Yes.

171
00:10:45,206 --> 00:10:46,400
- Really?
- Yes.

172
00:10:46,566 --> 00:10:49,319
- May I ask why?
- Okay, let me talk to her.

173
00:10:49,486 --> 00:10:52,239
- Will you stop? I'm on the telephone.
- Can I talk to her, please?

174
00:11:03,486 --> 00:11:04,680
- Hey.
- Hey.

175
00:11:04,846 --> 00:11:07,280
- What are you up to?
- Nothing.

176
00:11:08,006 --> 00:11:09,200
What's the rope for?

177
00:11:12,326 --> 00:11:14,920
Well, how do you like that?
I got rope.

178
00:11:16,886 --> 00:11:18,114
Well, I gotta go.

179
00:11:18,566 --> 00:11:21,034
- The dog. You're getting the dog!
- Kramer, where you going?

180
00:11:21,206 --> 00:11:24,642
- Out!
- Don't go. Kramer! Come back.

181
00:11:24,806 --> 00:11:27,161
I got great news!

182
00:11:29,046 --> 00:11:30,479
Well...

183
00:11:30,846 --> 00:11:32,757
...I did it.

184
00:11:33,086 --> 00:11:36,078
- Did what?
- I got engaged. I'm getting married.

185
00:11:36,246 --> 00:11:39,079
I asked Susan to marry me.
We're getting married this Christmas.

186
00:11:39,246 --> 00:11:42,363
- You're getting married?
- Yes!

187
00:11:43,766 --> 00:11:46,326
- Oh, my God!
- I asked her to get married.

188
00:11:46,486 --> 00:11:49,398
I'm a man. Jerry, I'm a man.

189
00:11:50,326 --> 00:11:52,396
And do you know why?

190
00:11:52,566 --> 00:11:54,636
It's because of that talk we had.

191
00:11:54,806 --> 00:11:57,923
You were my inspiration.
Do you believe it? You.

192
00:11:58,086 --> 00:12:00,395
That lunch was the defining moment
of my life.

193
00:12:01,406 --> 00:12:03,715
- I'm blown away!
- Are you blown?

194
00:12:03,886 --> 00:12:05,763
- Blown!
- You like that?

195
00:12:05,926 --> 00:12:08,360
- And she said yes?
- Well...

196
00:12:08,526 --> 00:12:11,598
...it took a couple hours of convincing,
but I was persistent.

197
00:12:11,766 --> 00:12:14,234
I was just like those guys
in the movies, and it worked.

198
00:12:14,406 --> 00:12:17,045
She said yes.
I can't believe my luck...

199
00:12:17,206 --> 00:12:20,881
...that she was still available,
a beautiful woman like that.

200
00:12:21,046 --> 00:12:22,957
You think she's good-looking, right?

201
00:12:23,446 --> 00:12:25,004
You're gonna have gorgeous kids.

202
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,361
She's got great skin.
She's got a rosy glow.

203
00:12:27,526 --> 00:12:29,721
- A pinkish hue?
- Oh, she's got the hue.

204
00:12:31,806 --> 00:12:35,799
So, what's going on with Melanie?
I know you're not getting married...

205
00:12:35,966 --> 00:12:38,275
- ... but things are happening?
- Well...

206
00:12:38,446 --> 00:12:42,280
...actually, we kind of broke up.

207
00:12:42,726 --> 00:12:43,761
You what?

208
00:12:44,046 --> 00:12:46,799
Well, we were having dinner,
and she's got the strangest habit.

209
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:49,844
She eats her peas one at a time.

210
00:12:50,086 --> 00:12:53,158
You've never seen anything like it.
It takes her an hour to finish them.

211
00:12:53,326 --> 00:12:54,839
We've had dinner other times.

212
00:12:55,006 --> 00:12:58,601
I've seen her eat corn niblets,
but she scooped them.

213
00:13:00,726 --> 00:13:03,604
- She scooped the niblets?
- Yes.

214
00:13:03,766 --> 00:13:06,280
That's what was so vexing.

215
00:13:11,926 --> 00:13:13,757
- What about the pact?
- What?

216
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:15,405
What happened to the pact?

217
00:13:15,566 --> 00:13:17,602
We were gonna change.
We shook hands on a pact.

218
00:13:17,766 --> 00:13:19,597
Did you not shake my hand
on a pact?

219
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:23,076
You stuck your hand out,
so I shook it.

220
00:13:23,246 --> 00:13:24,520
I don't know about a pact.

221
00:13:24,686 --> 00:13:26,995
Anyway, you should be happy.
You're engaged.

222
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,565
You're getting married.

223
00:13:29,566 --> 00:13:33,115
Well, it's not that. I just- You know,
I thought that we were both-

224
00:13:33,286 --> 00:13:35,242
You thought
I was gonna get married?

225
00:13:35,406 --> 00:13:37,442
Well, maybe not married, but-

226
00:13:37,606 --> 00:13:39,403
I mean, you love Susan, right?

227
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,679
Yeah.

228
00:13:41,846 --> 00:13:44,235
You wanna spend
the rest of your life with her.

229
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:48,719
Yeah.

230
00:13:49,366 --> 00:13:51,084
So?

231
00:13:52,886 --> 00:13:54,604
Yeah.

232
00:13:55,046 --> 00:13:57,606
- This doesn't make any difference.
- No.

233
00:13:58,806 --> 00:14:01,798
- So we're still on to see Firestorm?
- Yeah.

234
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,355
I'll pick you up at your apartment.
We'll go to the 8.

235
00:14:04,646 --> 00:14:07,365
- Yeah.
- Hey, wait a second. Wait a second!

236
00:14:08,286 --> 00:14:11,164
Celebrate!
How about some champagne?

237
00:14:11,326 --> 00:14:12,884
- Champagne?
- Yes, come on!

238
00:14:13,046 --> 00:14:14,923
How often do you get engaged?

239
00:14:15,086 --> 00:14:17,156
- Come on.
- Okay. All right.

240
00:14:22,006 --> 00:14:23,883
You know what?

241
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:28,998
No champagne.

242
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:39,122
Anyway, I'll see you later.

243
00:14:40,326 --> 00:14:41,475
Yeah.

244
00:14:48,606 --> 00:14:50,722
That's it. That's it.
Stop right here.

245
00:14:50,886 --> 00:14:53,446
How much is that doggie
In the window?

246
00:14:53,606 --> 00:14:55,244
Will you shut up?

247
00:14:55,406 --> 00:14:57,203
Is that a new song?

248
00:14:57,366 --> 00:14:58,879
All right, give me the rope.

249
00:14:59,046 --> 00:15:00,798
What? What do you need
a rope for?

250
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:03,480
- Look, I don't have time to explain.
- Oh, I don't know.

251
00:15:03,646 --> 00:15:05,318
I'm thinking
maybe we shouldn't do this.

252
00:15:05,486 --> 00:15:07,841
- I knew you'd back out.
- Are we doing a bad thing?

253
00:15:08,006 --> 00:15:11,715
Look, we drop the dog off in front
of somebody's house in the country.

254
00:15:11,886 --> 00:15:13,524
They find it and adopt it.

255
00:15:13,686 --> 00:15:17,645
Now the dog is prancing in the fields,
dancing and prancing.

256
00:15:17,806 --> 00:15:19,762
Fresh air, dandelions.

257
00:15:19,926 --> 00:15:22,076
We're doing this dog a huge favour.

258
00:15:22,926 --> 00:15:23,915
Yeah, yeah.

259
00:15:27,046 --> 00:15:29,606
- That's him.
- All right.

260
00:15:29,766 --> 00:15:30,755
I'm going in.

261
00:15:31,566 --> 00:15:33,397
Keep the motor running.

262
00:15:36,366 --> 00:15:37,515
Ready?

263
00:15:38,686 --> 00:15:41,758
- I don't really think I can go.
- Oh, how come?

264
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:44,282
Well, I didn't really tell Susan
about it...

265
00:15:44,446 --> 00:15:47,358
...and she doesn't really
have anything else to do.

266
00:15:47,526 --> 00:15:48,754
She can come.

267
00:15:49,526 --> 00:15:52,324
Well, she doesn't
really wanna see Firestorm.

268
00:15:54,566 --> 00:15:55,760
She...

269
00:15:56,326 --> 00:15:59,159
She wants to see The Muted Heart.

270
00:16:00,806 --> 00:16:04,958
Oh, The Muted Heart. Glenn Close,
Sally Field. That should be good.

271
00:16:05,126 --> 00:16:07,959
- Yeah. I guess I'll see you later.
- Wait. We can share a cab.

272
00:16:08,126 --> 00:16:10,924
- They're playing at the same Cineplex.
- George, better get ready.

273
00:16:12,646 --> 00:16:14,079
I am ready.

274
00:16:14,566 --> 00:16:15,760
You're wearing that shirt?

275
00:16:20,766 --> 00:16:23,234
- Okay, I guess I'll see you down there.
- Yeah.

276
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:27,245
- What time you got?
- No, I don't wear a watch.

277
00:16:27,726 --> 00:16:30,559
- Well, what do you do?
- Well, I tell time by the sun.

278
00:16:30,726 --> 00:16:33,798
- How close do you get?
- Well, I can guess within an hour.

279
00:16:35,406 --> 00:16:38,921
Well, I can guess within the hour, and
I don't even have to look at the sun.

280
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:41,484
What about at night?
What do you then?

281
00:16:41,646 --> 00:16:44,718
Well, night's tougher.
But it's only a couple of hours.

282
00:16:44,886 --> 00:16:47,525
- Okay, let's go. Move.
- You got it?

283
00:16:47,686 --> 00:16:49,722
What do you think?
Drive! Drive!

284
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,405
Where is it? Where is it?

285
00:16:56,086 --> 00:16:57,439
This?

286
00:16:57,606 --> 00:17:00,074
- This is the dog?
- Yep.

287
00:17:00,246 --> 00:17:02,919
- But it's so small.
- Yeah, but he's a fighter.

288
00:17:03,086 --> 00:17:05,646
That can't be the dog.
You sure you got the right one?

289
00:17:05,806 --> 00:17:08,081
You said the second courtyard.
He was there.

290
00:17:08,246 --> 00:17:10,123
- How could that be it?
- Get him to bark.

291
00:17:10,286 --> 00:17:12,675
- Yeah, I'll know it if it barks.
- All right. Bark.

292
00:17:12,846 --> 00:17:13,995
- Bark!
- Bark!

293
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,519
- Bark!
- Bark!

294
00:17:15,686 --> 00:17:16,880
- Bark!
- Bark!

295
00:17:18,406 --> 00:17:21,603
- Did you like it?
- Yes, it was very, very good.

296
00:17:22,926 --> 00:17:26,475
- Do you think he'll ever find her?
- Oh, I sure hope so.

297
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:28,716
How about when Ford
jumped out of that plane...

298
00:17:28,886 --> 00:17:30,638
...and was shooting back
as he was falling?

299
00:17:30,806 --> 00:17:34,003
- What about the underwater escape?
- Oh, man.

300
00:17:39,126 --> 00:17:41,799
Let's put the radio on.
Maybe there's a news report about it.

301
00:17:41,966 --> 00:17:43,445
Let's dump it. I'm getting antsy.

302
00:17:43,606 --> 00:17:45,961
- Think we're far enough?
- We're nearly to Monticello.

303
00:17:46,126 --> 00:17:49,482
Yeah. I think this looks right.

304
00:17:50,686 --> 00:17:52,563
All right. Give me the dog.

305
00:17:53,046 --> 00:17:56,038
- Yeah, that's it. Yeah.
- There.

306
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:00,475
Okay, boy. This is it.

307
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,796
This is your new home.

308
00:18:03,446 --> 00:18:04,799
Let go. Let go of my shirt.

309
00:18:04,966 --> 00:18:08,197
Come on. Let go of my shirt!
This shirt is from Rudy's!

310
00:18:20,206 --> 00:18:22,083
- Hello.
- MSG's rerunning the Yankee game.

311
00:18:22,246 --> 00:18:23,440
- You watching?
- They are?

312
00:18:23,606 --> 00:18:27,645
George, are you coming to bed?
I taped Mad About You.

313
00:18:29,846 --> 00:18:31,518
Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.

314
00:18:31,686 --> 00:18:32,880
What was that?

315
00:18:33,046 --> 00:18:35,435
- Nothing. I gotta go.
- Oh, Mattingly just singled.

316
00:18:35,766 --> 00:18:38,326
You know, it was very wrong of you
to back out on that deal.

317
00:18:38,486 --> 00:18:41,762
- I just shook your hand.
- That's a deal where I come from.

318
00:18:41,926 --> 00:18:43,598
We come from the same place.

319
00:18:43,766 --> 00:18:45,802
George, I'm starting it.

320
00:18:45,966 --> 00:18:48,002
I gotta go.

321
00:19:36,286 --> 00:19:38,800
Roxy, where have you been?

322
00:19:38,966 --> 00:19:42,402
We've been worried sick about you.

323
00:19:43,246 --> 00:19:44,918
What's this?

324
00:19:51,286 --> 00:19:54,642
No. No, it's impossible.

325
00:19:54,966 --> 00:19:57,321
It's impossible.

326
00:19:58,846 --> 00:20:01,997
I don't know how it happened.
We were practically in Monticello.

327
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:05,476
I mean, how could that thing have
found its way back? There is no way.

328
00:20:05,846 --> 00:20:07,325
- Very strange.
- I know.

329
00:20:07,486 --> 00:20:10,159
So tell me, anyway,
who was the big mastermind?

330
00:20:11,326 --> 00:20:14,921
I can't, Jerry. I'm sworn to secrecy.

331
00:20:15,686 --> 00:20:20,202
All right. But then I can't tell you
the big news.

332
00:20:21,606 --> 00:20:23,597
News? What news?

333
00:20:23,766 --> 00:20:25,438
Sorry.

334
00:20:25,606 --> 00:20:28,564
What? What?

335
00:20:29,366 --> 00:20:31,357
All right, Elaine.
But this is beyond news.

336
00:20:31,526 --> 00:20:33,835
This is like Pearl Harbor
or the Kennedy assassination.

337
00:20:34,006 --> 00:20:35,997
It's, like, not even news,
it's total shock.

338
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:40,205
Oh, come on, Jerry. Please, please,
please, please, please.

339
00:20:40,886 --> 00:20:43,559
George Costanza...

340
00:20:44,806 --> 00:20:46,159
Yeah?

341
00:20:46,326 --> 00:20:47,839
...is getting married!

342
00:20:48,726 --> 00:20:50,557
Get out!

343
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:58,280
Hi.

344
00:20:58,446 --> 00:21:00,641
- You Cosmo Kramer?
- Yes. Yeah.

345
00:21:01,406 --> 00:21:04,045
- You recognize this piece of fabric?
- Yeah. Yeah, that's-

346
00:21:04,206 --> 00:21:05,559
What?

347
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:07,355
Nothing.

348
00:21:07,526 --> 00:21:09,198
- You're under arrest.
- Arrest?

349
00:21:09,366 --> 00:21:11,960
I have a receipt for a rental car
with your signature...

350
00:21:12,126 --> 00:21:15,118
...including a report of some damage
to the rear seat.

351
00:21:15,606 --> 00:21:17,642
It seems as if the springs
were so compressed...

352
00:21:17,806 --> 00:21:20,843
- ... that they collapsed the right side.
- Newman!

353
00:21:28,406 --> 00:21:30,795
What took you so long?

354
00:21:34,006 --> 00:21:37,078
- What do you think they'll do to us?
- Don't worry about a thing.

355
00:21:37,246 --> 00:21:40,158
In 20 minutes, that place
will be swarming with mailmen.

356
00:21:40,326 --> 00:21:43,841
We'll be back on the street
by lunch.

357
00:21:44,566 --> 00:21:46,318
I gotta make some changes.

358
00:21:46,486 --> 00:21:49,717
I'm not a woman. I'm a child.

359
00:21:50,366 --> 00:21:52,402
What kind of life is this?
