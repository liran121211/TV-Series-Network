1
00:00:10,847 --> 00:00:11,882
- Hey.
- Hey.</i>

2
00:00:12,047 --> 00:00:15,437
Big news. The dog problem
has been solved.</i>

3
00:00:15,607 --> 00:00:16,596
Really? What happened?</i>

4
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:18,678
Well, there's this rabbi
in my building-</i>

5
00:00:18,847 --> 00:00:20,724
You've met him.
He's a very nice man.</i>

6
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:23,765
- Is he the one with the show on cable?
- Yeah, yeah, that's the one.</i>

7
00:00:23,927 --> 00:00:27,158
So I spoke to him about the dog,
he went down, talked to the owner...</i>

8
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:29,795
...and she agreed to keep the dog
inside from now on.</i>

9
00:00:29,967 --> 00:00:32,401
- That's great.
- I know.</i>

10
00:00:47,727 --> 00:00:50,719
- That looks pretty good.
- He's in.</i>

11
00:00:53,207 --> 00:00:55,767
Hey, so, you know, we haven't
discussed George's engagement.</i>

12
00:00:55,927 --> 00:00:58,964
- What's to discuss?
- Come on. George is getting married.</i>

13
00:00:59,127 --> 00:01:00,321
Is he happy?</i>

14
00:01:01,247 --> 00:01:03,636
I will never understand
the bathrooms in this country.</i>

15
00:01:03,807 --> 00:01:07,436
Why is it that the stall doors do not
come all the way down to the floor?</i>

16
00:01:07,607 --> 00:01:10,326
Maybe it's so you can see
if there's someone in there.</i>

17
00:01:10,607 --> 00:01:12,359
Isn't that why we have locks
on the doors?</i>

18
00:01:12,527 --> 00:01:15,280
Well, as a backup system,
in case the lock is broken...</i>

19
00:01:15,447 --> 00:01:17,199
...you can see if it's taken.</i>

20
00:01:17,367 --> 00:01:19,437
A backup system?</i>

21
00:01:20,007 --> 00:01:22,316
We're designing bathroom doors
with our legs exposed...</i>

22
00:01:22,487 --> 00:01:25,399
...in anticipation
of the locks not working?</i>

23
00:01:26,287 --> 00:01:29,643
That's not a system. That's
a complete breakdown of the system.</i>

24
00:01:29,807 --> 00:01:31,684
Can we change the subject, please?</i>

25
00:01:31,847 --> 00:01:34,077
Why, what's wrong with it?
This is a bad subject?</i>

26
00:01:34,247 --> 00:01:37,319
No, fine. If you wanna keep
talking about it, we'll talk about it.</i>

27
00:01:37,807 --> 00:01:39,718
It's not that I wanna keep
talking about it.</i>

28
00:01:39,887 --> 00:01:43,084
I just think the subject should resolve
itself based on its own momentum.</i>

29
00:01:43,247 --> 00:01:46,000
Well, I didn't think
that it had any momentum.</i>

30
00:01:47,767 --> 00:01:49,359
How am I gonna do this?</i>

31
00:01:49,527 --> 00:01:52,883
I'm engaged to this woman?
She doesn't even lik e me.</i>

32
00:01:53,047 --> 00:01:56,005
Change the subject?
Toilets were the subject.</i>

33
00:01:56,167 --> 00:01:58,761
We don't even share
the same interests.</i>

34
00:02:02,887 --> 00:02:06,960
- Yeah, he seems pretty happy.
- Well, that's all that counts, I guess.</i>

35
00:02:08,767 --> 00:02:10,166
What's the matter?</i>

36
00:02:10,327 --> 00:02:12,318
What? Nothing.

37
00:02:13,207 --> 00:02:15,721
You don't seem too enthused
about the whole thing.</i>

38
00:02:15,887 --> 00:02:17,559
Well, what do you want me to do?</i>

39
00:02:18,727 --> 00:02:21,195
I thought you'd have
some reaction to it.</i>

40
00:02:23,687 --> 00:02:25,359
Well, I don't.</i>

41
00:02:27,127 --> 00:02:28,799
I think maybe you're a little jealous.</i>

42
00:02:28,967 --> 00:02:31,765
Oh, what, you think
I wanna marry George?</i>

43
00:02:31,927 --> 00:02:35,078
No, but maybe you wish it was you
who was getting married, not him.</i>

44
00:02:35,247 --> 00:02:38,239
Oh, please.
That is the last thing that I want.</i>

45
00:02:38,407 --> 00:02:40,398
Oh, yeah. Right.</i>

46
00:02:40,567 --> 00:02:42,000
Yeah, right.</i>

47
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:45,443
- Laney.
- Jerry.</i>

48
00:02:45,607 --> 00:02:47,723
- You don't wanna get married?
- Yeah, that's right.</i>

49
00:02:47,887 --> 00:02:49,639
- I don't wanna get married.
- Oh, come on.</i>

50
00:02:49,807 --> 00:02:51,399
- Oh, you come on.
- It's such-</i>

51
00:02:51,567 --> 00:02:52,556
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.</i>

52
00:02:52,727 --> 00:02:56,003
Hey, Elaine, listen, I was talking
to a friend about this dog business.</i>

53
00:02:56,167 --> 00:02:59,842
Do you realize this is going to be
on our permanent records?</i>

54
00:03:00,007 --> 00:03:01,360
Are you aware of this?</i>

55
00:03:01,847 --> 00:03:03,917
- Oh, dear.
- It can never be erased.</i>

56
00:03:04,087 --> 00:03:07,124
It'll follow us wherever we go
for the rest of our lives.</i>

57
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:11,246
I'll never be able to get a job.
I mean, doesn't that concern you?</i>

58
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:14,286
Everything I've worked for,
down the drain...</i>

59
00:03:14,447 --> 00:03:16,085
...because of one stupid mistake.</i>

60
00:03:16,247 --> 00:03:19,045
I mean, aren't we entitled
to make one mistake in our lives?</i>

61
00:03:19,207 --> 00:03:20,925
- We gotta change the system.
- Yes!</i>

62
00:03:21,087 --> 00:03:23,043
I could care less.</i>

63
00:03:23,447 --> 00:03:26,484
I hope it is on our record.
I'm just sorry they didn't lock me up.</i>

64
00:03:37,127 --> 00:03:39,357
- Oh, hello, Rabbi Kursham.
- Elaine.</i>

65
00:03:39,527 --> 00:03:41,279
Always a pleasure to see you.</i>

66
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:44,361
Thanks again for taking care
of that dog for us.</i>

67
00:03:44,527 --> 00:03:48,361
Elaine, oftentimes in life
there are problems...</i>

68
00:03:48,527 --> 00:03:51,405
...and just as often
there are solutions.</i>

69
00:03:52,087 --> 00:03:53,600
Yeah, yeah, I suppose.</i>

70
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:58,966
Elaine, you don't seem yourself today.
You seem, if I may say, troubled.</i>

71
00:03:59,847 --> 00:04:01,758
No, Rabbi, I'm not myself.</i>

72
00:04:02,327 --> 00:04:05,637
Come upstairs. We'll have a talk.</i>

73
00:04:07,767 --> 00:04:08,995
Hey.</i>

74
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:10,964
I want your honest opinion
about something.</i>

75
00:04:11,127 --> 00:04:14,005
- Have I ever been less than forthright?
- No, you haven't.</i>

76
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:16,522
Well, maybe you have.
What do I know?</i>

77
00:04:16,687 --> 00:04:19,360
I probably have. Of course I have.
What am I talking about?</i>

78
00:04:19,527 --> 00:04:22,644
Okay, tell me what you think
about this idea:</i>

79
00:04:22,807 --> 00:04:26,595
Extend the doors on the toilet stalls
at Yankee Stadium...</i>

80
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:27,916
...all the way to the floor.</i>

81
00:04:28,327 --> 00:04:33,640
Extend the doors on the toilet stalls
at Yankee Stadium to the floor?</i>

82
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:36,002
Door comes down,
hides your feet.</i>

83
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:39,716
- Yes, I like it. I like it a lot.
- It's good, right?</i>

84
00:04:39,887 --> 00:04:42,640
I think it's fantastic.
I think it's a fantastic idea.</i>

85
00:04:42,807 --> 00:04:44,081
- You do?
- Yes, I do.</i>

86
00:04:44,247 --> 00:04:47,523
Well, I told it to Susan before
and she didn't like it.</i>

87
00:04:48,207 --> 00:04:50,402
Yeah. Not only that,
this is what she said to me:</i>

88
00:04:50,567 --> 00:04:51,886
"Can we change the subject?"</i>

89
00:04:52,047 --> 00:04:53,878
- See, now, that I don't care for.
- Right.</i>

90
00:04:54,047 --> 00:04:56,561
I mean, we're on a subject.
Why does it have to be changed?</i>

91
00:04:56,727 --> 00:04:58,638
It should resolve of its own volition.</i>

92
00:04:58,807 --> 00:05:01,321
That's exactly what I said,
but I used the word "momentum."</i>

93
00:05:01,487 --> 00:05:04,206
- "Momentum,"same thing.
- Same thing.</i>

94
00:05:05,047 --> 00:05:07,515
My God, I'm getting married
in December. Do you know that?</i>

95
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,446
Yeah, I know.</i>

96
00:05:09,607 --> 00:05:12,041
How am I gonna make December?
I need a little more time.</i>

97
00:05:12,207 --> 00:05:13,606
Look at me,
I'm a nervous wreck.</i>

98
00:05:13,767 --> 00:05:16,076
My stomach aches.
My neck is killing me. I can't turn.</i>

99
00:05:16,247 --> 00:05:18,317
Look, look.

100
00:05:18,487 --> 00:05:21,524
- You're turning.
- No, that's not a good turn.</i>

101
00:05:21,687 --> 00:05:23,757
December! December!</i>

102
00:05:23,927 --> 00:05:27,124
Don't you think we should have a little
more time to get to know each other?</i>

103
00:05:27,807 --> 00:05:29,843
If you need more time,
you should have more time.</i>

104
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:33,045
- What, you think I could postpone it?
- Sure you can. Why not?</i>

105
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:36,085
- You're allowed to postpone?
- I don't see why not.</i>

106
00:05:36,887 --> 00:05:39,117
- So I could do that?
- Sure, go ahead.</i>

107
00:05:42,007 --> 00:05:45,317
All right. All right.

108
00:05:45,487 --> 00:05:47,637
I'll tell you what, how about this?
I got the date.</i>

109
00:05:47,807 --> 00:05:50,082
March 21 st, the first day of spring.</i>

110
00:05:50,247 --> 00:05:52,715
- Spring, of course.
- You know, spring.</i>

111
00:05:52,887 --> 00:05:55,765
Rejuvenation, rebirth,
everything's blooming.</i>

112
00:05:55,927 --> 00:05:57,724
All that crap.

113
00:05:58,967 --> 00:06:00,400
Beautiful.</i>

114
00:06:00,607 --> 00:06:03,724
- She's not gonna like it.
- No, she's not.</i>

115
00:06:04,887 --> 00:06:07,447
You know, I think
I'm a little bit scared of her.</i>

116
00:06:07,727 --> 00:06:11,117
She's 5'3", like 100 pounds,
I'm frightened to death of her.</i>

117
00:06:11,727 --> 00:06:15,276
Well, she's a women.
They don't like to be disappointed.</i>

118
00:06:15,447 --> 00:06:17,165
Especially her.</i>

119
00:06:17,327 --> 00:06:19,795
She does not like disappointment.</i>

120
00:06:21,327 --> 00:06:22,316
Well, I have to do it.</i>

121
00:06:22,487 --> 00:06:24,557
I can't make December.
No way I can make December.</i>

122
00:06:24,727 --> 00:06:26,638
You can see that, right?
I mean, look at me.</i>

123
00:06:26,807 --> 00:06:30,482
Can I make December? I can't
make December, right? Look! Look!</i>

124
00:06:30,647 --> 00:06:33,241
- Yeah, you'd better shoot for March.
- March 21 st.</i>

125
00:06:33,407 --> 00:06:35,523
Hey. So you're gonna
back me on this, right?</i>

126
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:38,485
- Oh, all the way.
- You are a good friend.</i>

127
00:06:38,647 --> 00:06:41,525
You know what, even if you killed
somebody, I wouldn't turn you in.</i>

128
00:06:43,607 --> 00:06:45,518
Is that so?

129
00:06:45,687 --> 00:06:48,963
Hey, Kramer, if I killed somebody,
would you turn me in?</i>

130
00:06:49,687 --> 00:06:51,484
Definitely.</i>

131
00:06:52,327 --> 00:06:54,795
- You're kidding.
- No, no, I would turn you in.</i>

132
00:06:56,127 --> 00:06:59,915
- You would turn me in?
- I wouldn't even think about it.</i>

133
00:07:00,647 --> 00:07:02,603
You're supposed to be
a friend of mine.</i>

134
00:07:02,767 --> 00:07:05,600
Well, what kind of person are you,
going around killing people?</i>

135
00:07:05,767 --> 00:07:07,598
Well, I'm sure I had a good reason.</i>

136
00:07:07,767 --> 00:07:10,645
Well, if you killed this person,
who's to say I wouldn't be next?</i>

137
00:07:10,807 --> 00:07:13,844
- But you know me.
- I thought I did.</i>

138
00:07:17,527 --> 00:07:21,281
I really appreciate your taking time
to talk with me, Rabbi.</i>

139
00:07:21,447 --> 00:07:25,042
You know, I'm not of your faith.
In fact, I'm not a very religious person.</i>

140
00:07:25,207 --> 00:07:29,678
But I do feel as if I'm in need
of some guidance here.</i>

141
00:07:29,847 --> 00:07:32,839
Would you care for a snack
of some kind?</i>

142
00:07:33,207 --> 00:07:36,404
I have the SnackWells,
which are very popular...</i>

143
00:07:36,567 --> 00:07:40,321
...although I think sometimes
with the so-called fat-free cookies...</i>

144
00:07:40,487 --> 00:07:45,481
...people may overindulge, forgetting
that they may be high in calories.</i>

145
00:07:45,647 --> 00:07:49,356
No. No, thank you.
I'm not very hungry.</i>

146
00:07:49,527 --> 00:07:51,518
Anyway...

147
00:07:52,687 --> 00:07:56,077
...this friend of mine, George,
got engaged.</i>

148
00:07:56,247 --> 00:07:58,078
- How wonderful.
- Yeah, yeah.</i>

149
00:07:58,247 --> 00:08:02,525
Well, for some reason...</i>

150
00:08:03,687 --> 00:08:06,645
...well, I find myself
just overcome...</i>

151
00:08:06,807 --> 00:08:09,765
...with feelings of jealousy
and resentment.</i>

152
00:08:09,927 --> 00:08:13,317
Doesn't it give you any joy
to see your friend...</i>

153
00:08:13,487 --> 00:08:16,365
...enter into this holiest of unions?</i>

154
00:08:16,527 --> 00:08:18,722
No, no. No, it doesn't.</i>

155
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:23,041
No joy. No joy whatsoever. It just-
The whole thing makes me...</i>

156
00:08:23,207 --> 00:08:24,845
...sick.

157
00:08:26,167 --> 00:08:27,646
You know, Elaine...</i>

158
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:31,402
...very often we cannot see
the forest for the trees.</i>

159
00:08:31,567 --> 00:08:33,523
Yeah, I don't know
what that means.</i>

160
00:08:34,487 --> 00:08:37,206
Well, for example,
say there's a forest-</i>

161
00:08:37,367 --> 00:08:41,519
Yeah, see, the thing is, Rabbi,
it should've been me.</i>

162
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:45,521
You know? I'm smart.
I'm attractive.</i>

163
00:08:45,687 --> 00:08:49,202
You know, my temple
has many single functions.</i>

164
00:08:49,367 --> 00:08:50,766
Oh, no, that's okay.

165
00:08:50,927 --> 00:08:55,637
My nephew Alex is someone who's
also looking. Perhaps I could...?</i>

166
00:08:55,887 --> 00:08:57,366
No, I don't think so.

167
00:08:57,527 --> 00:09:02,078
He owns a flower store.
Very successful.</i>

168
00:09:04,087 --> 00:09:05,839
So you're nothing but a stoolie.
Admit it.</i>

169
00:09:06,007 --> 00:09:08,885
Hey, don't do the crime
if you can't do the time.</i>

170
00:09:09,167 --> 00:09:11,601
- Another caffe latte?
- Yeah, you better believe it.</i>

171
00:09:11,767 --> 00:09:15,203
- Since when are you so trendy?
- Hey, baby, I set the trends.</i>

172
00:09:15,367 --> 00:09:17,403
Who do you think
started this caffe latte thing?</i>

173
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,523
I don't recall you
drinking caffe lattes.</i>

174
00:09:19,687 --> 00:09:22,042
I've been drinking caffe lattes
since the fifth grade...</i>

175
00:09:22,207 --> 00:09:23,356
...and haven't looked back.</i>

176
00:09:23,527 --> 00:09:25,882
Look, Plan 9 from Outer Space
is playing tomorrow night.</i>

177
00:09:26,047 --> 00:09:27,958
- One show only.
- I've always wanted to see it.</i>

178
00:09:28,127 --> 00:09:29,924
I was supposed to see this
five years ago.</i>

179
00:09:30,087 --> 00:09:32,317
I was in a Chinese restaurant
with George and Elaine.</i>

180
00:09:32,487 --> 00:09:33,920
We got screwed up
and missed it.</i>

181
00:09:34,087 --> 00:09:35,600
- Well, let's do it, huh?
- All right.</i>

182
00:09:35,767 --> 00:09:38,964
Look at this, Jerry.
Dropping paper on the ground.</i>

183
00:09:39,127 --> 00:09:40,719
See, that's littering.</i>

184
00:09:40,887 --> 00:09:43,117
Maybe you ought to call the cops
and turn me in.</i>

185
00:09:43,607 --> 00:09:45,359
Maybe I will.</i>

186
00:09:51,127 --> 00:09:53,038
- Hi.
- Hey, how was your day?</i>

187
00:09:53,207 --> 00:09:54,799
Good. Good day.

188
00:09:54,967 --> 00:09:57,686
- How was-? How was your day?
- Oh, it was okay.

189
00:09:58,287 --> 00:10:00,847
- So, what's going on?
- Oh, nothing much.

190
00:10:01,007 --> 00:10:04,317
You know, went over to Jerry's,
talked to Jerry.</i>

191
00:10:04,487 --> 00:10:07,684
Oh, the Lauers wanna get together
with us on Friday night.</i>

192
00:10:07,847 --> 00:10:09,326
The Lauers? Really?</i>

193
00:10:09,487 --> 00:10:12,399
- Do you not wanna go?
- No, no. I wanna go.

194
00:10:12,647 --> 00:10:14,922
So, what did Jerry have to say?</i>

195
00:10:15,087 --> 00:10:18,716
Oh, nothing much.
You know, we were talking.</i>

196
00:10:25,847 --> 00:10:27,599
I had an unbelievable idea
today.</i>

197
00:10:27,767 --> 00:10:29,837
Oh, yeah, the toilets. You told me.</i>

198
00:10:30,007 --> 00:10:32,441
Yeah. No, it's not the toilets.
It's something else.</i>

199
00:10:32,607 --> 00:10:33,881
- You ready for this?
- Yeah.</i>

200
00:10:34,047 --> 00:10:35,275
- Okay, how about this?
- What?

201
00:10:35,447 --> 00:10:36,516
- All right.
- Okay.

202
00:10:36,847 --> 00:10:38,963
We get married...</i>

203
00:10:39,127 --> 00:10:41,595
...March 21 st,
the first day of spring.</i>

204
00:10:42,007 --> 00:10:44,316
What do you mean?
You wanna postpone the wedding?</i>

205
00:10:44,487 --> 00:10:46,637
No, no, this has got nothing
to do with postponing.

206
00:10:46,807 --> 00:10:49,844
I just think the first day of spring
is the perfect day to get married.</i>

207
00:10:50,007 --> 00:10:53,682
Spring! Rejuvenation, rebirth,
everything is blooming. All that-</i>

208
00:10:54,167 --> 00:10:59,287
If you don't wanna marry me, George,
just say so. Just say so!</i>

209
00:10:59,447 --> 00:11:00,846
No, no, still marry. Still marry.

210
00:11:01,007 --> 00:11:05,125
- No, you don't love me.
- No, no, still love. Still love.</i>

211
00:11:05,607 --> 00:11:07,643
My friends told me
that you were too neurotic...</i>

212
00:11:07,807 --> 00:11:11,083
- ... and that I was making a mistake.
- No, no, no. No mistake. No mistake.</i>

213
00:11:11,247 --> 00:11:13,203
Listen, we're gonna get married
over Christmas.</i>

214
00:11:13,367 --> 00:11:16,325
Really, it doesn't make
any difference to me. It's fine, really.</i>

215
00:11:16,487 --> 00:11:18,876
- You sure?
- Yeah, yeah. Sure, sure. Christmas.</i>

216
00:11:19,047 --> 00:11:23,279
Snow, Santa, all that stuff.

217
00:11:24,727 --> 00:11:25,842
Let me take a guess.</i>

218
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:29,201
She cried and you caved.</i>

219
00:11:30,487 --> 00:11:33,957
- How did you know that?
- I live and breathe, my friend.</i>

220
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:37,199
I live and breathe.</i>

221
00:11:37,367 --> 00:11:40,484
I felt terrible. I thought she was
gonna collapse and kill herself.</i>

222
00:11:40,647 --> 00:11:43,844
Yes, it's very difficult.
Few men have the constitution for it.</i>

223
00:11:44,007 --> 00:11:45,838
That's why breakups
take two or three tries.</i>

224
00:11:46,007 --> 00:11:47,440
You gotta build up your immunity.

225
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:49,837
You see those tears,
you don't know what to do.</i>

226
00:11:50,007 --> 00:11:52,805
It's like she was on fire.
I was just trying to put her out.</i>

227
00:11:54,687 --> 00:11:58,600
Well, at least you probably had some
pretty good make-up sex afterwards.</i>

228
00:11:59,367 --> 00:12:01,642
I didn't have any sex.</i>

229
00:12:01,927 --> 00:12:05,317
You didn't have make-up sex?
How could you not have make-up sex?</i>

230
00:12:05,487 --> 00:12:07,842
That's the best feature
of the heavy relationship.</i>

231
00:12:08,447 --> 00:12:11,325
I missed out on the make-up sex.</i>

232
00:12:12,687 --> 00:12:13,676
In your situation...

233
00:12:13,847 --> 00:12:16,407
...the only sex you're gonna have
better than make-up sex...</i>

234
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:19,479
...is if you're sent to prison
and you have a conjugal visit.</i>

235
00:12:20,087 --> 00:12:23,762
Yeah, conjugal-visit sex.
That is happening.</i>

236
00:12:29,007 --> 00:12:33,762
Look, I can tell you're very upset,
but I'm sorry, I'm not going.</i>

237
00:12:36,407 --> 00:12:37,840
Did you hear that?</i>

238
00:12:38,367 --> 00:12:42,565
I can't believe this. Look at this guy.
He's eating a sandwich.</i>

239
00:12:42,727 --> 00:12:45,036
Are you gonna eat those fries?</i>

240
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,241
This is amazing.

241
00:12:54,847 --> 00:12:57,486
Thank you. Thank you very much.</i>

242
00:12:57,647 --> 00:12:58,875
I'm going back in.

243
00:13:00,207 --> 00:13:01,686
Feel better.</i>

244
00:13:02,647 --> 00:13:04,524
Poor bastard.

245
00:13:12,087 --> 00:13:13,486
Good evening, Rabbi.</i>

246
00:13:13,647 --> 00:13:16,081
Good evening. And how does
this evening find you?</i>

247
00:13:16,247 --> 00:13:17,839
Well, Rabbi. Well.</i>

248
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:20,521
I trust you're here
to see your friend, Elaine?</i>

249
00:13:20,687 --> 00:13:23,997
- Yeah, that's right.
- I hope she's feeling better.</i>

250
00:13:24,207 --> 00:13:25,401
What do you mean?</i>

251
00:13:25,567 --> 00:13:27,364
- She didn't tell you?
- No.</i>

252
00:13:28,047 --> 00:13:30,720
Well, it seems the engagement
of her friend George...</i>

253
00:13:30,887 --> 00:13:33,196
...has left her feeling
bitter and hostile.</i>

254
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,956
- Is that so?
- Oh, yes.</i>

255
00:13:37,127 --> 00:13:39,038
In fact, she told me
that she wishes...</i>

256
00:13:39,207 --> 00:13:41,437
...she was the one
who was getting married.</i>

257
00:13:42,247 --> 00:13:43,566
Really?</i>

258
00:13:43,727 --> 00:13:47,276
- She came off as pretty desperate.
- I didn't know any of this.</i>

259
00:13:47,447 --> 00:13:51,440
Apparently, she doesn't think much
of this George fellow either.</i>

260
00:13:51,607 --> 00:13:56,203
I recall the word "loser"peppered
throughout our conversation.</i>

261
00:13:57,447 --> 00:13:59,278
Well, this all comes as news to me.</i>

262
00:14:03,047 --> 00:14:05,038
- Hi.
- Hi, how was your day?

263
00:14:05,207 --> 00:14:06,640
Good. Good day.

264
00:14:06,807 --> 00:14:09,560
- How was your day?
- Oh, it was okay.

265
00:14:09,727 --> 00:14:13,959
- So, what's going on?
- Oh, nothing much, you know.

266
00:14:14,127 --> 00:14:17,403
I went over to Jerry's.
You know, talked to Jerry.</i>

267
00:14:21,847 --> 00:14:24,315
Could I-?
Could I talk to you for a minute?</i>

268
00:14:24,487 --> 00:14:25,966
Yeah, sure.</i>

269
00:14:26,167 --> 00:14:27,600
All right.

270
00:14:29,207 --> 00:14:30,959
You see, this is the thing.</i>

271
00:14:37,247 --> 00:14:40,876
I just feel like I can't do this
in December.</i>

272
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:45,165
I just feel like I need a little more time
because I feel like I'm not ready yet.</i>

273
00:14:45,327 --> 00:14:47,921
I'm frightened and I'm scared.</i>

274
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:53,286
And I just feel we need a little
more time to get to know each other.</i>

275
00:14:55,447 --> 00:14:58,439
But I could do it in March.
I promise. I promise.</i>

276
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:01,997
No more postponements. I just
need three more months, please.</i>

277
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:04,727
Oh, George, George.</i>

278
00:15:04,887 --> 00:15:06,161
Of course.</i>

279
00:15:06,327 --> 00:15:09,637
Of course it can wait till March
if that's what you want.</i>

280
00:15:09,807 --> 00:15:12,196
- Yeah?
- Oh, don't worry.</i>

281
00:15:12,367 --> 00:15:16,326
Yes, of course, of course.</i>

282
00:15:21,527 --> 00:15:23,119
I have that magazine article for you.</i>

283
00:15:24,047 --> 00:15:26,436
You know, I had a little talk
with the rabbi outside.</i>

284
00:15:26,607 --> 00:15:28,677
- Oh, you did?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

285
00:15:28,847 --> 00:15:31,520
Understand you had
a little talk with him too.</i>

286
00:15:31,687 --> 00:15:33,405
Yeah, we talked earlier.</i>

287
00:15:33,567 --> 00:15:36,161
Yes, I know, I know.</i>

288
00:15:39,367 --> 00:15:42,643
- What does that mean?
- Nothing. Nothing.</i>

289
00:15:48,167 --> 00:15:50,442
- He didn't mention...?
- Yes, he did.</i>

290
00:15:50,607 --> 00:15:54,441
- He told you about the conversation?
- Oh, we had quite a little chat.</i>

291
00:15:54,607 --> 00:15:58,122
- He told you about-?
- Yes, how you are jealous of George.</i>

292
00:15:58,287 --> 00:16:00,642
How you wish you were
getting married instead of him.</i>

293
00:16:00,807 --> 00:16:02,320
He told you that? How could he?</i>

294
00:16:02,487 --> 00:16:05,126
And it didn't take much
prodding either, I have to say.</i>

295
00:16:05,287 --> 00:16:08,165
- Can he do that?
- He did.</i>

296
00:16:08,327 --> 00:16:11,922
But he's a rabbi. How can a rabbi
have such a big mouth?</i>

297
00:16:12,087 --> 00:16:13,839
That's what's so fascinating.

298
00:16:15,807 --> 00:16:17,843
You better finish your
little caffe latte there.</i>

299
00:16:18,007 --> 00:16:20,043
- They'll never let you in with it.
- Why not?</i>

300
00:16:20,207 --> 00:16:23,119
Because they don't allow
outside drinks into the movie.</i>

301
00:16:23,447 --> 00:16:26,120
- Well, that's stupid.
- That's the rule.</i>

302
00:16:26,287 --> 00:16:29,199
Yeah, well, we'll just see if
we can't get around that.</i>

303
00:16:35,367 --> 00:16:37,597
Oh, Elaine, come in, come in.</i>

304
00:16:38,127 --> 00:16:40,277
- So nice to see you again.
- Yeah.</i>

305
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:43,678
Can I offer you some
kasha varnishkes?</i>

306
00:16:43,847 --> 00:16:47,123
No, no. Listen, Rabbi,
I'd like to ask you a question.</i>

307
00:16:47,287 --> 00:16:51,200
Why? Why did you tell my friend
Jerry what I talked to you about?</i>

308
00:16:51,367 --> 00:16:55,997
- Was that a problem for you?
- Of course it was problem for me!</i>

309
00:16:56,407 --> 00:16:59,444
You didn't-? You didn't tell
anyone else about this, did you?</i>

310
00:16:59,607 --> 00:17:01,518
Well, let's see...</i>

311
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:07,042
I seem to recall a conversation
with Mrs. Winston in 1 F.</i>

312
00:17:07,207 --> 00:17:08,196
Mrs. Winston?

313
00:17:08,567 --> 00:17:10,797
Yes, we were waiting
for our mail to arrive...</i>

314
00:17:10,967 --> 00:17:13,322
...and I happened to mention
to her...</i>

315
00:17:13,487 --> 00:17:16,240
...how you felt it was never
going to "happen"for you.</i>

316
00:17:18,487 --> 00:17:21,923
What about Don Ramsey? You didn't
mention anything to him, did you?</i>

317
00:17:22,247 --> 00:17:23,236
Don Ramsey?</i>

318
00:17:23,407 --> 00:17:26,444
You know, that tall good-looking guy,
he lives on the fifth floor?</i>

319
00:17:26,607 --> 00:17:28,245
Oh, him.

320
00:17:28,407 --> 00:17:31,717
Well, this morning I happened
to find myself in the elevator with him.</i>

321
00:17:31,887 --> 00:17:33,843
Oh, my God, you didn't.

322
00:17:36,367 --> 00:17:37,880
Excuse me.</i>

323
00:17:38,167 --> 00:17:40,044
Pardon me. Excuse us.</i>

324
00:17:43,327 --> 00:17:44,840
My coffee!</i>

325
00:17:53,927 --> 00:17:56,395
Hey, hey, what's going on?
What just happened here?</i>

326
00:17:56,567 --> 00:17:57,682
Nothing. Nothing.

327
00:17:57,847 --> 00:18:00,566
What do you got? One of those
caffe lattes in your shirt?</i>

328
00:18:00,727 --> 00:18:03,719
I don't have anything. What?
Ask him.</i>

329
00:18:05,607 --> 00:18:07,359
All right. Come on, coffee boy.</i>

330
00:18:07,527 --> 00:18:09,961
- What?
- Come on, now. Here we go.</i>

331
00:18:12,927 --> 00:18:16,806
I mean, the whole thing is a mess.
He told everyone in the building.</i>

332
00:18:16,967 --> 00:18:18,878
I ran into that cute guy
on the fifth floor...</i>

333
00:18:19,047 --> 00:18:21,402
...I mean, he could barely
bring himself to nod.</i>

334
00:18:22,607 --> 00:18:26,282
Elaine, if I could say a word here
about the Jewish people.</i>

335
00:18:27,287 --> 00:18:29,881
That man in no way
represents our ability...</i>

336
00:18:30,047 --> 00:18:33,835
...to take in a nice piece of juicy gossip
and keep it to ourselves.</i>

337
00:18:34,007 --> 00:18:35,759
You didn't say anything
to George, did you?</i>

338
00:18:35,927 --> 00:18:37,121
No.

339
00:18:37,287 --> 00:18:40,245
About how you wish it was you who
was getting married instead of him.</i>

340
00:18:40,407 --> 00:18:44,366
- Feelings of resentment, hostility.
- Yeah, yeah. So what?</i>

341
00:18:45,007 --> 00:18:50,161
- Hey.
- Georgie, congratulations!</i>

342
00:18:50,327 --> 00:18:54,081
Oh, my God, I haven't seen you
since it happened.</i>

343
00:18:54,247 --> 00:18:56,681
I couldn't be happier for you.</i>

344
00:18:57,247 --> 00:18:58,475
Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot.

345
00:18:58,727 --> 00:19:03,118
Oh, come on. Come on.
You really, really deserve it.</i>

346
00:19:03,687 --> 00:19:05,439
Deserve?
I don't know about deserve.</i>

347
00:19:05,607 --> 00:19:06,596
Are you kidding?</i>

348
00:19:06,767 --> 00:19:09,565
I have seen the changes in you
the past couple of years.</i>

349
00:19:09,727 --> 00:19:13,515
Man, you have grown.
You've matured.</i>

350
00:19:13,807 --> 00:19:15,604
Yeah, I guess I'm getting older.</i>

351
00:19:15,967 --> 00:19:19,562
Well, I just think it's wonderful.
Honestly.</i>

352
00:19:19,727 --> 00:19:24,164
I've gotta run, but please,
please give my best to Susan.</i>

353
00:19:24,327 --> 00:19:25,555
My most just...

354
00:19:25,727 --> 00:19:28,082
- ... heartfelt congratulations.
- Yeah, thanks.</i>

355
00:19:28,247 --> 00:19:29,680
Listen, if you ever get a date...</i>

356
00:19:29,847 --> 00:19:32,361
...maybe the four of us
could go out together sometime.</i>

357
00:19:34,287 --> 00:19:36,005
Yes. Yes, yes. Sure.</i>

358
00:19:36,167 --> 00:19:38,840
Wasn't there some guy in your
building that you said you liked?</i>

359
00:19:39,007 --> 00:19:41,202
He lived up on the fifth floor
or something?</i>

360
00:19:41,367 --> 00:19:43,403
- Yes. Yes, yes, yes.
- Yeah.</i>

361
00:19:45,007 --> 00:19:47,726
- Boy, she is something, isn't she?
- Yeah, she's something else.</i>

362
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:50,276
Hey, so, what happened?
Did you hold your ground or...?</i>

363
00:19:50,447 --> 00:19:54,645
- Nope. I wept like a baby.
- What?</i>

364
00:19:54,807 --> 00:19:57,924
Well, I started to tell her, and then
all of a sudden, for some reason...</i>

365
00:19:58,087 --> 00:19:59,839
...I just burst into tears.</i>

366
00:20:00,007 --> 00:20:02,441
- You cried?
- I bawled uncontrollably.</i>

367
00:20:02,607 --> 00:20:06,122
I just poured my guts out. And
I'll tell you, Jerry, it was incredible.</i>

368
00:20:06,407 --> 00:20:08,796
I never realized how powerful
these tears are.</i>

369
00:20:08,967 --> 00:20:12,243
I could have postponed it
another five years if I wanted to.</i>

370
00:20:12,767 --> 00:20:13,802
- Hey.
- Hey.</i>

371
00:20:13,967 --> 00:20:16,356
Sorry about that movie thing.
I was joking around.</i>

372
00:20:16,527 --> 00:20:17,960
Sorry? Are you kidding?</i>

373
00:20:18,127 --> 00:20:19,765
You did me the biggest favour
of my life.</i>

374
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:23,636
I spoke to a lawyer.
We're suing for millions.</i>

375
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:27,766
- Suing? What for?
- The coffee was too hot.</i>

376
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,844
- It's supposed to be hot.
- Not that hot.</i>

377
00:20:39,127 --> 00:20:43,245
The prophet Isaiah tells us
that without friends...</i>

378
00:20:43,407 --> 00:20:46,319
...our lives are empty
and meaningless.</i>

379
00:20:46,487 --> 00:20:49,763
Wait a minute. That's the rabbi
from Elaine's building.</i>

380
00:20:49,927 --> 00:20:52,122
I just met this guy the other day.</i>

381
00:20:53,367 --> 00:20:56,882
A young lady I know,
let's cal her Elaine...</i>

382
00:21:00,087 --> 00:21:02,726
...happened to find herself
overwhelmed...</i>

383
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:06,846
...with feelings of resentment
and hostility for her friend...</i>

384
00:21:07,007 --> 00:21:08,645
...let's cal him George.</i>

385
00:21:10,927 --> 00:21:13,805
She felt that George
was somewhat of a loser...</i>

386
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:18,804
...and that she was the one
who deserved to be married first.</i>

387
00:21:19,127 --> 00:21:23,837
She also happened to mention to me
that her friend had wondered...</i>

388
00:21:24,007 --> 00:21:28,876
...if going to a prostitute while you're
engaged is considered cheating.</i>

389
00:21:32,527 --> 00:21:34,119
His feeling was...</i>

390
00:21:34,287 --> 00:21:36,323
...they're never going
to see each other again...</i>

391
00:21:36,487 --> 00:21:38,682
...so, what's the difference?</i>

392
00:21:39,207 --> 00:21:42,756
But that is a subject
for another sermon.</i>

393
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:46,636
And now I'd lik e to close
with a psalm.</i>
