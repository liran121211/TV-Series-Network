1
00:00:03,857 --> 00:00:05,290
<i>They got us trained
to use the cash machine.</i>

2
00:00:05,457 --> 00:00:06,651
<i>We're chickens in an experiment...</i>

3
00:00:06,817 --> 00:00:08,887
<i>...waiting for that pellet
to come down the shoot.</i>

4
00:00:09,097 --> 00:00:12,328
<i>You see people at the cash machine.
They're just there.</i>

5
00:00:15,297 --> 00:00:16,571
<i>Waiting for the sound.</i>

6
00:00:16,737 --> 00:00:19,649
<i>You're waiting for the sound.
That's what we're trained to hear.</i>

7
00:00:19,817 --> 00:00:22,456
<i>The here-comes-the-money sound,
you know?</i>

8
00:00:24,737 --> 00:00:27,126
<i>It's exciting. Don't you get excited?</i>

9
00:00:28,657 --> 00:00:30,807
"It's coming. It's coming.

10
00:00:30,977 --> 00:00:33,207
<i>They're giving me money."</i>

11
00:00:39,137 --> 00:00:41,697
<i>Hey, I gotta get some cash.
I'm gonna run down to the ATM.</i>

12
00:00:41,897 --> 00:00:44,047
<i>- Yeah, I gotta grab some too.
- I'll get it for you.</i>

13
00:00:44,217 --> 00:00:45,969
<i>Just give me your card.</i>

14
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:49,647
<i>- Are you sure?
- Yeah, just tell me your code.</i>

15
00:00:52,137 --> 00:00:53,490
<i>My code?</i>

16
00:00:54,977 --> 00:00:58,049
<i>- So why didn't you tell her the code?
- No way.</i>

17
00:00:58,217 --> 00:01:01,368
<i>George, you're gonna
marry this woman, most likely.</i>

18
00:01:01,657 --> 00:01:03,693
<i>It says very clearly,
"For your protection...</i>

19
00:01:03,857 --> 00:01:06,576
<i>...do not give your secret code
to anyone."</i>

20
00:01:06,777 --> 00:01:09,735
<i>So you're taking relationship advice
from Chemical Bank now?</i>

21
00:01:10,457 --> 00:01:13,017
<i>Why does everything have to be "us"?
Is there no "me"left?</i>

22
00:01:13,177 --> 00:01:16,533
<i>Why can't there be some things
just for me? Is that so selfish?</i>

23
00:01:16,737 --> 00:01:18,967
<i>Actually, that's the definition
of selfish.</i>

24
00:01:19,177 --> 00:01:20,690
<i>Have you given your code
to anyone?</i>

25
00:01:20,897 --> 00:01:24,048
<i>No one's ever asked. Do you want it?
It's Jor-El.</i>

26
00:01:24,257 --> 00:01:26,771
<i>- Superman's father on Krypton.
- Of course.</i>

27
00:01:27,097 --> 00:01:29,247
<i>Come on, Georgie,
you know you wanna tell me.</i>

28
00:01:29,657 --> 00:01:31,648
<i>It's eating you up inside.</i>

29
00:01:32,377 --> 00:01:33,730
<i>Sing it, sister.</i>

30
00:01:33,937 --> 00:01:38,010
<i>No. No, I am not giving my code
to anyone for any reason.</i>

31
00:01:38,417 --> 00:01:40,214
<i>What if my life depended on it?</i>

32
00:01:41,337 --> 00:01:44,215
<i>If you're in some situation where
fast cash will save your life...</i>

33
00:01:44,377 --> 00:01:46,095
<i>...I'll give you the code.</i>

34
00:01:47,937 --> 00:01:50,292
<i>- What's the matter with your leg?
- My foot fell asleep.</i>

35
00:01:50,457 --> 00:01:52,846
<i>- How did your foot fall asleep?
- I crossed my legs.</i>

36
00:01:53,017 --> 00:01:54,689
<i>I forgot to alternate.</i>

37
00:01:54,857 --> 00:01:56,176
<i>- Hey, Jerry, George.
- Hey, Fred.</i>

38
00:01:56,337 --> 00:01:57,975
<i>- Hey, Freddie.
- Foot fell asleep.</i>

39
00:01:58,177 --> 00:02:00,691
<i>You're lucky. At least you got
something to do.</i>

40
00:02:02,897 --> 00:02:04,376
<i>- Hey, Fred, do you know Elaine?
- No.</i>

41
00:02:04,537 --> 00:02:06,971
<i>Nice to meet you. Well, I'm out of here.
See you, guys.</i>

42
00:02:07,177 --> 00:02:08,735
<i>- All right, Fred.
- See you.</i>

43
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:12,931
<i>Did you hear that?
He said, "Nice to meet you."</i>

44
00:02:13,337 --> 00:02:16,295
<i>- So?
- So we've met before.</i>

45
00:02:16,457 --> 00:02:19,449
<i>At Katie Ash's party.
We talked for, like, 10 minutes.</i>

46
00:02:19,657 --> 00:02:21,409
<i>And he didn't remember you?</i>

47
00:02:22,057 --> 00:02:25,686
<i>- Where are you going?
- I gotta go talk to him.</i>

48
00:02:26,817 --> 00:02:28,853
<i>Excuse me. Excuse me, Fred.</i>

49
00:02:29,017 --> 00:02:30,973
<i>- Yeah.
- Hi.</i>

50
00:02:31,177 --> 00:02:34,294
<i>You just said, "Nice to meet you,"
but actually we've met before.</i>

51
00:02:34,497 --> 00:02:37,057
<i>- We have?
- Yeah. Yeah, at Katie Ash's party.</i>

52
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:38,690
<i>What was your name again?</i>

53
00:02:38,857 --> 00:02:41,690
<i>Elaine. You don't remember
our conversation?</i>

54
00:02:41,857 --> 00:02:43,893
<i>I talked about how
my uncle worked...</i>

55
00:02:44,057 --> 00:02:46,776
<i>...in the book depository building
with Lee Harvey Oswald.</i>

56
00:02:47,737 --> 00:02:49,011
<i>Not ringing a bell.</i>

57
00:02:49,177 --> 00:02:52,055
<i>When my uncle said to him,
"The president's been shot"...</i>

58
00:02:52,217 --> 00:02:55,129
<i>...Oswald winked at him and said,
"I'm gonna go catch a movie."</i>

59
00:02:57,137 --> 00:02:59,093
<i>- No.
- Right when we were in front of...</i>

60
00:02:59,257 --> 00:03:01,646
<i>- ... the bathroom door.
- The bathroom door.</i>

61
00:03:01,817 --> 00:03:05,287
<i>I remember someone had played
tic-tac-toe on it and the X's won.</i>

62
00:03:05,457 --> 00:03:09,166
<i>They went diagonally from
the top left to the bottom right.</i>

63
00:03:14,097 --> 00:03:16,213
<i>Sounds great. I'd love to do
some TV commercials.</i>

64
00:03:16,377 --> 00:03:17,890
<i>That should really be fun.</i>

65
00:03:18,977 --> 00:03:22,447
<i>Okay. All right, bye.
How do you like that?</i>

66
00:03:22,657 --> 00:03:25,171
<i>I'm gonna do TV spots
for Leapin' Larry's Appliance Store.</i>

67
00:03:25,337 --> 00:03:27,897
<i>That was Leapin' Larry himself.
I'm gonna meet him tomorrow.</i>

68
00:03:28,057 --> 00:03:30,013
<i>Leapin' Larry.
That's where I bought this.</i>

69
00:03:30,217 --> 00:03:32,731
<i>- What is that?
- It's an emergency-band scanner.</i>

70
00:03:32,897 --> 00:03:36,526
<i>It picks up everything:
fires, harbour patrol, even the police.</i>

71
00:03:36,697 --> 00:03:39,257
<i>I'm watching the watchers, Jerry.</i>

72
00:03:41,497 --> 00:03:43,886
<i>We got a big fire on 115th.</i>

73
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:47,572
<i>I tell you, if I could do it over again,
I'd give it all up to be a fireman.</i>

74
00:03:47,777 --> 00:03:50,575
<i>Yeah, those civil servants who
risk their lives really got it made.</i>

75
00:03:50,737 --> 00:03:54,013
<i>Yeah. When I was a kid,
all I ever dreamed of...</i>

76
00:03:54,177 --> 00:03:56,771
<i>...was steering the back
of that big hook-and-ladder.</i>

77
00:03:56,977 --> 00:03:59,127
<i>You're lucky they let you drive a car.</i>

78
00:04:00,217 --> 00:04:02,287
<i>No, no, no. They're taking
the West Side Highway.</i>

79
00:04:02,457 --> 00:04:04,288
<i>At this time of day? That's insane.</i>

80
00:04:04,457 --> 00:04:07,017
<i>They're heading
straight into gridlock.</i>

81
00:04:07,217 --> 00:04:09,208
<i>Oh, those fools.</i>

82
00:04:10,457 --> 00:04:12,652
What was that? All right.

83
00:04:12,817 --> 00:04:15,456
<i>So get a load of this.</i>

84
00:04:15,617 --> 00:04:16,970
<i>This guy, Fred Yerkes...</i>

85
00:04:17,137 --> 00:04:21,016
<i>...remembers every little thing
about that night except me.</i>

86
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:23,566
<i>Really? I'm surprised.
He doesn't meet that many women.</i>

87
00:04:25,017 --> 00:04:26,496
<i>So, what are you saying?</i>

88
00:04:26,937 --> 00:04:29,690
<i>What's to be said.
He didn't remember you.</i>

89
00:04:29,897 --> 00:04:32,730
<i>Yeah, but why? I mean...</i>

90
00:04:34,417 --> 00:04:35,850
...you know.

91
00:04:36,017 --> 00:04:37,291
I know.

92
00:04:37,497 --> 00:04:39,374
<i>- You know?
- Yeah, I know.</i>

93
00:04:40,617 --> 00:04:42,926
<i>- You got the new catalogue.
- Yeah. Good piece...</i>

94
00:04:43,097 --> 00:04:45,770
<i>- ... on the Himalayan Walking Shoe.
- Too good. Peterman was so pleased...</i>

95
00:04:45,937 --> 00:04:48,371
<i>...now he wants to take me
out to dinner tomorrow.</i>

96
00:04:48,537 --> 00:04:50,846
<i>- Maybe you wanna come.
- Why would I wanna do that?</i>

97
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:52,615
<i>Please, Jerry.
Please, please, please.</i>

98
00:04:52,777 --> 00:04:54,847
<i>I can't sit with him.
He tells these stories.</i>

99
00:04:55,017 --> 00:04:57,212
<i>It's gonna be awful.</i>

100
00:04:57,377 --> 00:04:58,651
<i>Yeah, sounds like fun.</i>

101
00:05:01,257 --> 00:05:02,929
<i>I want you to tell me, George.</i>

102
00:05:03,097 --> 00:05:04,735
<i>Why? Why is my code
so important?</i>

103
00:05:04,897 --> 00:05:06,694
<i>Because it's part of our relationship.</i>

104
00:05:06,857 --> 00:05:08,529
It's an indication of trust.

105
00:05:08,697 --> 00:05:10,927
<i>We're not supposed to
keep secrets from one another.</i>

106
00:05:11,137 --> 00:05:13,173
<i>I'm sure you have secrets from me.</i>

107
00:05:13,337 --> 00:05:15,897
<i>I don't know anything
about your cycles.</i>

108
00:05:16,857 --> 00:05:19,735
<i>- My cycles?
- I never know what's going on there.</i>

109
00:05:21,097 --> 00:05:24,487
<i>Well, from now on,
I'll keep you apprised of my cycles.</i>

110
00:05:24,697 --> 00:05:26,733
<i>- Please.
- Anything else?</i>

111
00:05:27,897 --> 00:05:29,649
<i>We're out of Bosco.</i>

112
00:05:31,257 --> 00:05:33,566
<i>How about this?
"Come on down to Leapin' Larry's.</i>

113
00:05:33,777 --> 00:05:35,893
<i>If you beat our prices,
we'll give you the store."</i>

114
00:05:37,657 --> 00:05:39,329
<i>You know, I've always liked
your comedy.</i>

115
00:05:39,497 --> 00:05:42,330
<i>- You don't take cheap shots.
- No, I don't.</i>

116
00:05:42,537 --> 00:05:46,212
<i>I'm sorry for keeping you so long.
Again, I apologize for the mess.</i>

117
00:05:46,617 --> 00:05:48,812
<i>This renovation is killing me.</i>

118
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,615
<i>My foot's asleep again.</i>

119
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:53,570
<i>When I lost my leg
in the boating accident last year...</i>

120
00:05:53,777 --> 00:05:57,167
<i>...I got so depressed
about this damn prosthetic...</i>

121
00:05:57,337 --> 00:05:59,897
<i>...I thought I was gonna have to
give up the business.</i>

122
00:06:00,057 --> 00:06:03,254
<i>But now, I'm rejuvenated.</i>

123
00:06:03,417 --> 00:06:05,772
<i>Let me show you around the store.</i>

124
00:06:05,937 --> 00:06:08,497
<i>You know what,
I'll be with you in a minute.</i>

125
00:06:15,577 --> 00:06:19,092
<i>That is a great impression.</i>

126
00:06:24,937 --> 00:06:26,848
<i>Larry, wait, you don't understand.</i>

127
00:06:27,577 --> 00:06:31,286
<i>I just came from Leapin' Larry's.
What, making fun of crippled people?</i>

128
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:32,856
<i>Is that what you've sunk to?</i>

129
00:06:33,057 --> 00:06:35,730
<i>No, I didn't do it on purpose.
My foot fell asleep.</i>

130
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,336
<i>Oh, your foot fell asleep.</i>

131
00:06:37,537 --> 00:06:41,576
<i>You know, the guy has one leg and
he still calls himself Leapin' Larry.</i>

132
00:06:41,737 --> 00:06:43,409
<i>You'd think he'd have
a sense of humour.</i>

133
00:06:43,617 --> 00:06:47,087
<i>You just joked yourself out of that
commercial, didn't you, munjamba?</i>

134
00:06:49,017 --> 00:06:50,655
<i>Yeah.</i>

135
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:53,650
Oh, boy. Look at that.

136
00:06:53,817 --> 00:06:56,012
<i>See, that's that fire
I was listening to yesterday.</i>

137
00:06:56,697 --> 00:06:58,050
<i>The whole building burned down.</i>

138
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:00,048
<i>They just don't know
what street to take.</i>

139
00:07:00,257 --> 00:07:03,169
<i>Remember I got us to Yankee Stadium
in rush hour in 15 minutes?</i>

140
00:07:03,337 --> 00:07:05,407
<i>- Of course.
- It's all up here, Jerry.</i>

141
00:07:05,577 --> 00:07:08,137
<i>All up here. It's innate.</i>

142
00:07:08,337 --> 00:07:10,726
<i>The amazing thing is
you never have any place to go.</i>

143
00:07:13,137 --> 00:07:14,411
<i>Where are we gonna eat?</i>

144
00:07:14,577 --> 00:07:16,807
<i>We're gonna meet Elaine and
Peterman at the Chinese place.</i>

145
00:07:17,177 --> 00:07:19,008
<i>Nobody mentioned
anything about Peterman.</i>

146
00:07:19,217 --> 00:07:20,855
<i>If I did, would you have gone?</i>

147
00:07:21,057 --> 00:07:22,331
<i>- No way.
- There you go.</i>

148
00:07:22,537 --> 00:07:23,811
<i>I don't even know Peterman.</i>

149
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:26,537
<i>Now how am I gonna relax?
I'm gonna have to be on all night.</i>

150
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:29,006
<i>I don't like being on, Jerry.
I'd much rather be off.</i>

151
00:07:29,217 --> 00:07:30,969
<i>Trust me, you're off.</i>

152
00:07:34,857 --> 00:07:36,131
<i>Oh, hi, Fred.</i>

153
00:07:37,337 --> 00:07:38,770
<i>Hello.</i>

154
00:07:38,977 --> 00:07:41,730
<i>- It's Elaine.
- Oh, yeah. Right.</i>

155
00:07:41,937 --> 00:07:44,451
<i>- Yeah. How you doing?
- I'm depressed.</i>

156
00:07:44,617 --> 00:07:46,767
<i>I got this new shirt.
The button fell off.</i>

157
00:07:46,937 --> 00:07:49,656
<i>Once the button falls off, that's it.
I'll never fix it.</i>

158
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:54,135
<i>- Yeah, that's too bad.
- Yeah, I'm gonna get some vitamins.</i>

159
00:07:54,297 --> 00:07:56,606
<i>- I feel depleted.
- I never take them.</i>

160
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:58,608
<i>They make you nauseous, right?</i>

161
00:07:58,817 --> 00:08:01,854
<i>Yeah. Yeah, that's right.
You remembered.</i>

162
00:08:02,057 --> 00:08:03,968
<i>Do you wanna have dinner tonight?</i>

163
00:08:05,337 --> 00:08:07,692
<i>- Tonight?
- What, you have other plans?</i>

164
00:08:08,177 --> 00:08:11,169
<i>No, no, no. None that I can...</i>

165
00:08:11,337 --> 00:08:13,248
<i>...remember.</i>

166
00:08:15,857 --> 00:08:20,055
<i>All right. You're locked up in a prison
in Turkey. I have your wallet.</i>

167
00:08:20,217 --> 00:08:22,492
<i>The only way I can bribe the guards
to get you out...</i>

168
00:08:22,697 --> 00:08:24,255
<i>...is for you to give me
your ATM code.</i>

169
00:08:24,417 --> 00:08:26,055
<i>- Call the embassy.
- They're closed.</i>

170
00:08:26,457 --> 00:08:28,413
<i>- Why?
- Bomb threat.</i>

171
00:08:29,617 --> 00:08:31,608
<i>- We're in Turkey?
- Midnight Express, my friend.</i>

172
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:34,446
<i>My card won't work.
They're not on the PLUS system.</i>

173
00:08:35,777 --> 00:08:38,166
<i>You must be Jerry Seinfeld.</i>

174
00:08:38,377 --> 00:08:40,208
<i>Yes. Hi, Mr. Peterman.</i>

175
00:08:40,417 --> 00:08:42,294
<i>This is George Costanza.</i>

176
00:08:42,457 --> 00:08:43,776
<i>J. Peterman.</i>

177
00:08:43,937 --> 00:08:45,495
<i>J. Crew.</i>

178
00:08:48,617 --> 00:08:50,175
<i>So is Elaine here?</i>

179
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:54,328
<i>Oh, Elaine just called.
She won't be joining us.</i>

180
00:08:54,537 --> 00:08:59,088
<i>But not to worry. I'll tell the maître d'
it'll just be the three bulls.</i>

181
00:09:02,457 --> 00:09:04,493
<i>What? He still wants to have dinner
with us?</i>

182
00:09:04,697 --> 00:09:07,086
<i>- Without Elaine? What for?
- What is he, crazy?</i>

183
00:09:07,937 --> 00:09:09,450
<i>Oh, we gotta get out of here.</i>

184
00:09:09,617 --> 00:09:11,255
<i>Come on, weave your web,
liar-man.</i>

185
00:09:13,297 --> 00:09:16,733
<i>- I got nothing. I- I'm blank.
- Come on, George...</i>

186
00:09:16,897 --> 00:09:19,889
<i>- ... what's the matter with you?
- I'm choking.</i>

187
00:09:20,457 --> 00:09:23,369
<i>Oh, Fong has been
most accommodating.</i>

188
00:09:23,537 --> 00:09:25,846
<i>- Shall we?
- Actually, I just remembered...</i>

189
00:09:26,017 --> 00:09:28,531
<i>...I promised this comedy club
that I'd do a set tonight.</i>

190
00:09:28,697 --> 00:09:31,530
<i>- I'm terribly sorry.
- I understand. No hard feelings.</i>

191
00:09:32,377 --> 00:09:34,208
<i>George and I
will miss your company.</i>

192
00:09:34,377 --> 00:09:36,971
<i>Fong, it will just
be two this evening.</i>

193
00:09:38,137 --> 00:09:39,809
<i>Well, George...</i>

194
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,647
<i>...we dine.</i>

195
00:09:45,137 --> 00:09:48,209
<i>I can't believe this.
This guy's standing me up?</i>

196
00:09:52,097 --> 00:09:57,217
<i>And there, tucked into the river's bend,
was the object of my search...</i>

197
00:09:57,417 --> 00:09:59,931
<i>...the Guangia River Market.</i>

198
00:10:00,097 --> 00:10:03,976
<i>Fabrics and spices
traded under a starlit sky.</i>

199
00:10:04,777 --> 00:10:07,974
<i>It was there that I discovered
the Pamplona Beret.</i>

200
00:10:08,537 --> 00:10:12,530
<i>Sizes seven and a half through
eight and three quarters. Price, $35.</i>

201
00:10:16,057 --> 00:10:19,094
What about sports?
You follow sports?

202
00:10:19,297 --> 00:10:22,448
<i>It's fourth and inches and
the Giants are going for it.</i>

203
00:10:22,617 --> 00:10:24,847
<i>You've gotta love sports.</i>

204
00:10:25,857 --> 00:10:29,133
<i>You know, this is very nice,
but I really could take a cab, really-</i>

205
00:10:29,297 --> 00:10:31,253
<i>Nonsense, George.</i>

206
00:10:31,457 --> 00:10:34,335
<i>Besides, it gives me a chance to
tell you about my trip to Burma.</i>

207
00:10:34,977 --> 00:10:37,775
<i>I discovered a very unusual
corduroy.</i>

208
00:10:41,537 --> 00:10:43,050
<i>Peterman here.</i>

209
00:10:44,057 --> 00:10:46,617
What? Oh, no.

210
00:10:47,217 --> 00:10:49,094
<i>All right. I'll be right there.</i>

211
00:10:49,257 --> 00:10:51,771
<i>It's my mother.
She's at death's door.</i>

212
00:10:51,977 --> 00:10:53,410
- What?
- I just pray to God...

213
00:10:53,617 --> 00:10:55,414
<i>...we can make it there in time.</i>

214
00:10:57,817 --> 00:11:00,047
<i>I can't believe you blew us off.
We did you a fav our.</i>

215
00:11:00,217 --> 00:11:01,969
<i>Well, Fred asked me out.</i>

216
00:11:02,657 --> 00:11:05,012
<i>- Fred?
- Yeah, and then he stood me up.</i>

217
00:11:05,177 --> 00:11:06,656
<i>I don't get this guy.</i>

218
00:11:06,857 --> 00:11:08,210
<i>You see what's going on here.</i>

219
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:10,652
<i>You're attracted to him because
he can't remember you.</i>

220
00:11:10,817 --> 00:11:12,967
I am? But that's so sick.

221
00:11:13,177 --> 00:11:14,610
That's God's plan.

222
00:11:14,777 --> 00:11:17,211
<i>He doesn't really want anyone
to get together.</i>

223
00:11:18,897 --> 00:11:20,216
<i>Anyway, so how was the dinner?</i>

224
00:11:20,857 --> 00:11:22,495
<i>Well, when I heard
you weren't coming...</i>

225
00:11:22,657 --> 00:11:24,807
<i>...I made an excuse and
got the hell out of there.</i>

226
00:11:25,097 --> 00:11:26,371
<i>What about Georgie?</i>

227
00:11:27,097 --> 00:11:29,486
<i>He didn't make it.</i>

228
00:11:31,737 --> 00:11:34,092
<i>- Doctor, how is she?
- She's too weak to talk.</i>

229
00:11:34,257 --> 00:11:38,773
<i>- She'll be happy to hear you.
- Mama, it's me, Jacobo.</i>

230
00:11:38,977 --> 00:11:41,093
<i>I'm here for you, Mama.</i>

231
00:11:46,217 --> 00:11:48,333
<i>I'm George Costanza.</i>

232
00:11:48,817 --> 00:11:51,012
<i>I was having dinner with your son.</i>

233
00:12:01,537 --> 00:12:03,528
<i>Shake off the dew, my friend.</i>

234
00:12:03,697 --> 00:12:05,176
Oh, man.

235
00:12:05,337 --> 00:12:07,328
<i>- What time is it?
- It's morning.</i>

236
00:12:07,497 --> 00:12:09,647
<i>Thanks for seeing me
through the night.</i>

237
00:12:09,817 --> 00:12:11,694
<i>I'll make us a pot of coffee, George.</i>

238
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:13,131
<i>Watch her, won't you?</i>

239
00:12:13,297 --> 00:12:15,288
- Who?
- Mama.

240
00:12:15,497 --> 00:12:17,055
<i>Just talk to her, George.</i>

241
00:12:17,257 --> 00:12:19,691
<i>The doctor seems to think it helps.</i>

242
00:12:29,337 --> 00:12:31,692
Hi. You know, I- I-

243
00:12:31,897 --> 00:12:36,095
<i>I really should be getting back
to my fiancée. You know, we...</i>

244
00:12:36,257 --> 00:12:39,055
<i>We had this big fight yesterday...</i>

245
00:12:40,457 --> 00:12:44,291
<i>...and, well, she wants to know
my secret code.</i>

246
00:12:45,017 --> 00:12:47,815
<i>I don't know. I can't tell her.</i>

247
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:54,125
<i>The funny thing is, you know,
I would really love to tell someone...</i>

248
00:12:54,297 --> 00:12:56,857
<i>...because it's killing me.</i>

249
00:13:03,897 --> 00:13:06,172
You wanna know what it is?

250
00:13:08,617 --> 00:13:10,494
It's Bosco.

251
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:12,409
<i>You know, the chocolate syrup.</i>

252
00:13:12,577 --> 00:13:16,411
<i>I love that stuff. I pour it in milk.
It's my favourite drink.</i>

253
00:13:18,817 --> 00:13:20,569
<i>Boy, that is a relief.</i>

254
00:13:21,737 --> 00:13:23,011
Bosco.

255
00:13:24,657 --> 00:13:26,454
Bosco.

256
00:13:27,417 --> 00:13:28,736
- Bosco.
- Mama?

257
00:13:28,937 --> 00:13:31,895
<i>- Quiet, quiet. It's a secret.
- Bosco! Bosco!</i>

258
00:13:32,057 --> 00:13:36,448
<i>- Shut up. It's a secret.
- Mama, what are you trying to say?</i>

259
00:13:36,657 --> 00:13:38,773
Bosco.

260
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:45,654
<i>She's gone.</i>

261
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:50,767
Bosco?

262
00:13:55,217 --> 00:13:56,775
<i>This never would have happened...</i>

263
00:13:56,937 --> 00:13:59,974
<i>- ... if you hadn't bailed out on me.
- I did not bail out on you.</i>

264
00:14:00,137 --> 00:14:02,014
<i>Why couldn't you include me
in your excuse?</i>

265
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:03,935
<i>Why didn't you
come up with your own?</i>

266
00:14:04,097 --> 00:14:05,769
<i>I froze.</i>

267
00:14:05,937 --> 00:14:07,655
<i>- I think I'm losing it.
- Oh, come on.</i>

268
00:14:07,817 --> 00:14:10,092
<i>- Maybe you're just in a slump.
- No, no.</i>

269
00:14:10,257 --> 00:14:13,249
<i>I reached down
and there was nothing there.</i>

270
00:14:14,137 --> 00:14:16,253
<i>Now Peterman wants me
to go to the funeral.</i>

271
00:14:16,457 --> 00:14:18,971
<i>Oh, come on, just tell me
your code already. What is it?</i>

272
00:14:19,457 --> 00:14:21,766
<i>I am not giving you my code.</i>

273
00:14:22,617 --> 00:14:25,415
<i>- I bet I can guess it.
- Yeah, right.</i>

274
00:14:25,937 --> 00:14:28,531
<i>Oh, all right. Yeah.</i>

275
00:14:28,697 --> 00:14:31,006
<i>Let's see.</i>

276
00:14:31,177 --> 00:14:34,806
<i>Well, we can throw out birthdays
immediately. That's too obvious.</i>

277
00:14:35,017 --> 00:14:37,212
<i>And no numbers for you.
You're a word man.</i>

278
00:14:37,497 --> 00:14:39,135
<i>All right. Let's go deeper.</i>

279
00:14:39,737 --> 00:14:41,853
<i>What kind of man are you?</i>

280
00:14:42,017 --> 00:14:44,292
<i>Well, you're weak, spineless.</i>

281
00:14:44,937 --> 00:14:47,087
<i>A man of temptations.</i>

282
00:14:47,577 --> 00:14:48,851
<i>But what tempts you?</i>

283
00:14:50,297 --> 00:14:52,447
<i>You're a portly fellow...</i>

284
00:14:52,617 --> 00:14:54,847
<i>...a little long in the waistband.</i>

285
00:14:55,537 --> 00:14:57,368
<i>So, what's your pleasure?</i>

286
00:14:58,337 --> 00:15:00,897
<i>Is it the salty snacks you crave?</i>

287
00:15:01,057 --> 00:15:03,013
No, no, no.

288
00:15:03,177 --> 00:15:05,611
<i>Yours is a sweet tooth.</i>

289
00:15:06,977 --> 00:15:09,366
<i>- Get out of here.
- Oh, you may stray...</i>

290
00:15:09,537 --> 00:15:12,654
<i>...but you'll always return
to your dark master...</i>

291
00:15:12,817 --> 00:15:14,933
<i>...the cocoa bean.</i>

292
00:15:15,097 --> 00:15:17,895
<i>- I'm leaving.
- And only the purest syrup nectar...</i>

293
00:15:18,057 --> 00:15:19,410
- ... can satisfy you.
- I gotta go.

294
00:15:19,577 --> 00:15:21,647
<i>If you could,
you'd guzzle it by the gallon.</i>

295
00:15:21,817 --> 00:15:25,856
<i>- Ovaltine, Hershey's, Nestlé's Quik.
- Shut up! Shut up!</i>

296
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:29,014
- What was that?
- What?

297
00:15:29,177 --> 00:15:31,771
<i>You just checked your watch.
Are you thinking of bailing?</i>

298
00:15:32,257 --> 00:15:34,327
<i>I got a date.</i>

299
00:15:34,497 --> 00:15:37,330
<i>- Oh, Mr. Peterman.
- Oh, Elaine.</i>

300
00:15:37,497 --> 00:15:38,976
<i>George.</i>

301
00:15:39,177 --> 00:15:41,816
<i>When Mama said "Bosco"...</i>

302
00:15:41,977 --> 00:15:43,888
<i>...she must have been
communicating something.</i>

303
00:15:44,057 --> 00:15:45,854
<i>Her legacy. A dying wish, perhaps.</i>

304
00:15:46,057 --> 00:15:47,695
<i>Mothers say things.</i>

305
00:15:47,857 --> 00:15:51,406
<i>My mother goes babbling on and on
like a crazy person.</i>

306
00:15:51,577 --> 00:15:52,851
<i>Mr. Peterman...</i>

307
00:15:53,017 --> 00:15:55,577
<i>...you have my deepest sympathies.</i>

308
00:15:56,417 --> 00:15:58,533
<i>Unfortunately, I've gotta get going.</i>

309
00:15:58,937 --> 00:16:02,168
<i>- You do?
- Yes, actually we both do.</i>

310
00:16:02,777 --> 00:16:04,733
<i>I have a personal commitment.</i>

311
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:08,492
<i>- Well, personal- I mean, we both...
- What is it?</i>

312
00:16:08,657 --> 00:16:11,967
<i>I'm speaking at a
woman's rights conference.</i>

313
00:16:13,497 --> 00:16:17,775
<i>Yes, and I'm speaking
at a men's conference.</i>

314
00:16:17,937 --> 00:16:19,973
<i>I don't believe that for a minute.</i>

315
00:16:20,857 --> 00:16:23,291
<i>- Elaine, it was good of you to stop by.
- My pleasure.</i>

316
00:16:23,457 --> 00:16:28,451
<i>Fortunately, I still have George here
to help me through this.</i>

317
00:16:29,297 --> 00:16:33,654
<i>You know, George, growing up
as a boy in Costa Rica...</i>

318
00:16:33,817 --> 00:16:36,968
<i>...I heard a rumour that
Mama had taken a lover.</i>

319
00:16:37,137 --> 00:16:40,413
<i>Perhaps Bosco was this man's name.</i>

320
00:16:42,297 --> 00:16:44,208
<i>You wanna come to
the fire station with me?</i>

321
00:16:44,377 --> 00:16:47,175
<i>- Fire station?
- Yeah, I made a map of my shortcuts.</i>

322
00:16:47,337 --> 00:16:48,850
<i>I'm gonna rock their world.</i>

323
00:16:49,017 --> 00:16:50,609
<i>I gotta go down to Leapin' Larry's.</i>

324
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:52,813
<i>- He took you back?
- Yeah, we straightened it out.</i>

325
00:16:52,977 --> 00:16:54,296
<i>- All is forgiven.
- You know...</i>

326
00:16:54,457 --> 00:16:56,812
<i>...the important thing is that
you learned something.</i>

327
00:16:56,977 --> 00:16:59,047
No, I didn't.

328
00:17:00,697 --> 00:17:03,575
<i>Well, Mr. Kramer, your list of shortcuts
is most impressive.</i>

329
00:17:03,737 --> 00:17:05,295
<i>This is just
the Upper West Side.</i>

330
00:17:05,497 --> 00:17:07,089
<i>Wait until I get to the Village.</i>

331
00:17:07,257 --> 00:17:09,612
<i>Then you're gonna see a magic show.</i>

332
00:17:09,817 --> 00:17:12,411
<i>Mr. Kramer, almost every week
some hothead like yourself...</i>

333
00:17:12,617 --> 00:17:15,370
<i>...saunters in here
talking about faster routes...</i>

334
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:17,568
<i>- ... and snazzier colours for the truck.
- Well, I-</i>

335
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:21,730
<i>The fact is, we feel things are
fine the way they are.</i>

336
00:17:23,217 --> 00:17:26,095
<i>Thanks for having me back and
sorry about the misunderstanding.</i>

337
00:17:26,257 --> 00:17:28,054
<i>Water under the bridge.</i>

338
00:17:28,217 --> 00:17:31,289
<i>Come on. I never did get a chance to
show you around the store.</i>

339
00:17:31,497 --> 00:17:32,896
<i>Oh, sure.</i>

340
00:17:33,897 --> 00:17:35,888
Oh, again.

341
00:17:39,417 --> 00:17:41,328
<i>I'll be right there.</i>

342
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:48,694
<i>Attention, company 390.
Structure fire...</i>

343
00:17:48,857 --> 00:17:51,246
<i>...at Leapin' Larry's
Appliance Warehouse.</i>

344
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,490
<i>Leapin' Larry's? Hey, that's uptown.
You gotta take Amsterdam.</i>

345
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:58,206
<i>- Stay out of this, Kramer.
- All right, men, let's move it.</i>

346
00:18:03,297 --> 00:18:04,730
<i>Pull those doors.</i>

347
00:18:05,737 --> 00:18:07,568
<i>Move. Move.</i>

348
00:18:07,737 --> 00:18:09,648
Giddyup.

349
00:18:14,857 --> 00:18:16,813
<i>Are you okay, cowboy?</i>

350
00:18:17,377 --> 00:18:22,326
<i>- Where do you need to go?
- I drive the back of the truck.</i>

351
00:18:25,177 --> 00:18:27,327
<i>You'd better take it easy.</i>

352
00:18:27,497 --> 00:18:30,170
<i>All right, 48, let's go. Let's go!</i>

353
00:18:34,457 --> 00:18:36,368
<i>Sorry about the other night.
My mother called.</i>

354
00:18:36,537 --> 00:18:38,892
<i>She couldn't find her pills.
I had to go into Brooklyn...</i>

355
00:18:39,057 --> 00:18:41,173
<i>...help her find the pills
and they were right in...</i>

356
00:18:41,337 --> 00:18:44,249
<i>...the medicine cabinet.
Could you believe that?</i>

357
00:18:44,417 --> 00:18:47,090
<i>The worst part is getting from
the subway station to the house.</i>

358
00:18:47,257 --> 00:18:48,576
<i>There's no transportation.</i>

359
00:18:48,777 --> 00:18:50,449
<i>What am I doing?</i>

360
00:18:50,617 --> 00:18:55,247
<i>I'm on a date with this guy
because he didn't remember me?</i>

361
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:56,930
<i>He's demented. Listen to him.</i>

362
00:18:57,097 --> 00:19:00,373
<i>I could take a cab, but if my mother
saw me in a cab, she would yell at me:</i>

363
00:19:00,537 --> 00:19:03,449
<i>"Freddie, what are you taking
a cab for? It's so expensive."</i>

364
00:19:03,737 --> 00:19:05,011
<i>She's out of her mind.</i>

365
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:07,691
<i>Eventually, you'll meet her.</i>

366
00:19:08,377 --> 00:19:10,174
Bosco.

367
00:19:12,057 --> 00:19:14,127
Bosco.

368
00:19:14,497 --> 00:19:15,850
Bosco.

369
00:19:16,217 --> 00:19:19,812
<i>There's a big fire down the street.
The whole block is going up in flames.</i>

370
00:19:23,377 --> 00:19:26,016
<i>George.</i>

371
00:19:28,697 --> 00:19:30,528
<i>We're gonna make a left
onto Broadway.</i>

372
00:19:30,697 --> 00:19:33,814
<i>No, I would advise against that.</i>

373
00:19:33,977 --> 00:19:35,933
<i>- Who is this?
- It's Kramer.</i>

374
00:19:36,937 --> 00:19:38,848
<i>Kramer?</i>

375
00:19:39,417 --> 00:19:41,009
<i>What are you doing back there?</i>

376
00:19:41,177 --> 00:19:44,169
<i>Desota's down,
but Cosmo's got the caboose.</i>

377
00:19:47,617 --> 00:19:50,415
<i>- How did this start?
- Beats me.</i>

378
00:19:51,097 --> 00:19:54,487
<i>Where the hell is the fire department?
I'm gonna lose the whole store.</i>

379
00:19:55,897 --> 00:19:57,489
<i>Kramer, get the hel out of there.</i>

380
00:19:57,657 --> 00:19:59,568
<i>You're not trained to
operate this equipment.</i>

381
00:19:59,737 --> 00:20:01,455
<i>- Hey, Kramer!
- Hey!</i>

382
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,414
<i>Pay attention, Kramer!</i>

383
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:06,045
<i>Hey, try the scanner.
See if you can pick up anything.</i>

384
00:20:09,017 --> 00:20:11,247
<i>What are you doing, Kramer?
You're al over the road.</i>

385
00:20:11,417 --> 00:20:14,329
<i>- Don't worry, cap, I can handle it.
- Kramer?</i>

386
00:20:17,737 --> 00:20:19,489
<i>You're losing control.</i>

387
00:20:19,657 --> 00:20:22,649
<i>Hard right! Hard right!</i>

388
00:20:23,177 --> 00:20:25,327
<i>We're never gonna to mak e it!</i>

389
00:20:28,657 --> 00:20:30,215
<i>That's a shame.</i>

390
00:20:30,417 --> 00:20:32,692
<i>This fire's gonna eat up
this entire block.</i>

391
00:20:33,337 --> 00:20:35,771
<i>George, look. There's a man in there.</i>

392
00:20:35,937 --> 00:20:37,336
<i>Get out. You're in danger.</i>

393
00:20:37,497 --> 00:20:40,648
<i>My sleeve, it's stuck in the machine.
It ate my card.</i>

394
00:20:40,817 --> 00:20:42,375
<i>George, give me your ATM card.</i>

395
00:20:42,537 --> 00:20:44,289
<i>I don't have my ATM card.</i>

396
00:20:44,457 --> 00:20:46,732
<i>George, you're obviously lying.
Anyone can see that.</i>

397
00:20:52,537 --> 00:20:53,970
<i>It's jammed.</i>

398
00:20:54,137 --> 00:20:56,571
<i>I'll slide it under the door.</i>

399
00:20:58,337 --> 00:21:00,328
<i>- Now give me your code.
- What? Why?</i>

400
00:21:00,497 --> 00:21:02,294
<i>The machine won't open
without the code.</i>

401
00:21:02,497 --> 00:21:04,055
<i>- George, give him your code.
- But I-</i>

402
00:21:04,217 --> 00:21:06,731
<i>George, there's no time.
Tell him your code.</i>

403
00:21:06,897 --> 00:21:08,410
<i>Shout out your code, man.</i>

404
00:21:08,617 --> 00:21:10,972
<i>Code! The code!</i>

405
00:21:21,217 --> 00:21:23,094
Hi.

406
00:21:25,097 --> 00:21:27,611
<i>- Here's your cash, George.
- Thanks.</i>

407
00:21:27,777 --> 00:21:29,176
<i>And here's your card back.</i>

408
00:21:31,897 --> 00:21:34,047
<i>Anyone for Bosco?</i>

409
00:21:35,457 --> 00:21:37,527
Oh, my God.

410
00:21:37,697 --> 00:21:39,415
- Look at this.
- What?

411
00:21:39,577 --> 00:21:41,693
<i>It's the new J. Peterman catalogue.
Look, look.</i>

412
00:21:43,217 --> 00:21:44,696
<i>"The Rogue's Wallet.</i>

413
00:21:44,857 --> 00:21:48,293
<i>It's where he kept his card,
his dirty little secret.</i>

414
00:21:48,457 --> 00:21:51,449
<i>Short, devious, balding...</i>

415
00:21:51,617 --> 00:21:54,085
<i>...his name was Costanza.</i>

416
00:21:54,257 --> 00:21:56,487
<i>He killed my mother."</i>
