1
00:00:08,927 --> 00:00:12,397
I can't believe
I'm going out with this guy.

2
00:00:12,687 --> 00:00:15,565
He's so cool.

3
00:00:16,087 --> 00:00:19,204
Maybe he'll write a song about me.
That would be amazing.

4
00:00:19,367 --> 00:00:22,325
"Oh, Elaine, you are so beautiful.

5
00:00:22,487 --> 00:00:24,762
So, so beautiful.

6
00:00:24,927 --> 00:00:28,715
Not to mention your personality,
which is so, so interesting.

7
00:00:28,887 --> 00:00:32,800
If you want, you can quit your job
and never work again. "

8
00:00:44,687 --> 00:00:47,759
Jerry, you have got to come see him.
He is so terrific.

9
00:00:47,927 --> 00:00:50,999
- Maybe he'll write a song about you.
- Yeah, right.

10
00:00:51,327 --> 00:00:53,124
Like that really matters.

11
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:55,039
So I take it he's sponge- worthy.

12
00:00:55,767 --> 00:00:58,804
Oh, yeah.

13
00:00:59,687 --> 00:01:01,723
He's a musician.
They're supposed to be very...

14
00:01:01,887 --> 00:01:04,560
...you know, uninhibited and free.

15
00:01:04,887 --> 00:01:08,004
Well, actually, he's not that way at all.

16
00:01:08,167 --> 00:01:10,920
- Oh, no?
- Yeah, in fact...

17
00:01:12,527 --> 00:01:14,245
Come on.

18
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,557
- Come on.
- I don't wanna.

19
00:01:16,727 --> 00:01:19,844
Elaine, you're among friends.

20
00:01:21,607 --> 00:01:27,364
Well, actually,
he doesn't really like to do...

21
00:01:28,247 --> 00:01:29,999
... everything.

22
00:01:33,447 --> 00:01:35,244
Yeah.

23
00:01:36,887 --> 00:01:40,800
- It's surprising.
- Yes, it is. It is surprising.

24
00:01:41,047 --> 00:01:43,277
- Does that bother you?
- No. No, it doesn't bother me.

25
00:01:43,447 --> 00:01:45,278
I mean, it would be nice.

26
00:01:45,447 --> 00:01:50,760
I'm not gonna lie to you
and say it wouldn't be nice.

27
00:01:50,927 --> 00:01:54,806
- Sure. Why not? You're there.
- Exactly.

28
00:01:54,967 --> 00:01:57,197
You said he was coming out
of a serious relationship.

29
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:00,484
Maybe he's, you know,
still kind of... He's...

30
00:02:00,807 --> 00:02:02,877
It's not gonna happen.

31
00:02:03,607 --> 00:02:06,963
Hey, Jerry. Listen, I need you
to help me get my stuff out of the car.

32
00:02:07,247 --> 00:02:09,442
- What stuff?
- I just came from the Price Club.

33
00:02:09,607 --> 00:02:12,804
- I'm loaded up, baby.
- All right.

34
00:02:16,727 --> 00:02:18,445
What, are you out of your mind?

35
00:02:18,607 --> 00:02:20,359
Look at this.
What did you buy here?

36
00:02:21,127 --> 00:02:23,687
You will never be able
to finish all this stuff.

37
00:02:23,847 --> 00:02:25,678
Of course I will.
These are all staples.

38
00:02:26,127 --> 00:02:28,880
A 4-pound can of black olives,
that's a staple?

39
00:02:29,047 --> 00:02:30,400
Lindsay olives, Jerry.

40
00:02:31,127 --> 00:02:35,484
A 48-pack of Eggo waffles.
A gallon of barbecue sauce.

41
00:02:35,647 --> 00:02:39,356
- Ten pounds of cocktail meatballs.
- $17.50. You can't beat that.

42
00:02:40,407 --> 00:02:43,558
- Look at this can of tuna.
- Yeah, StarKist, Jerry.

43
00:02:43,727 --> 00:02:46,161
- Most tuna don't make their cut.
- This isn't for a person.

44
00:02:46,327 --> 00:02:47,601
It's for Biosphere 3.

45
00:02:48,127 --> 00:02:49,924
- Hey, Clyde.
- Hey, Kramer.

46
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:53,284
- What's happening, dude?
- Yeah. Hey, this is Jerry.

47
00:02:53,447 --> 00:02:54,926
- How you doing?
- Hi.

48
00:02:55,087 --> 00:02:56,566
He plays backup
with John Germaine.

49
00:02:56,727 --> 00:02:58,001
John Germaine?

50
00:02:58,167 --> 00:03:00,556
That's amazing. I was just
talking about him with Elaine.

51
00:03:00,727 --> 00:03:01,921
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

52
00:03:02,087 --> 00:03:03,725
My friend Elaine and him
are going out.

53
00:03:03,887 --> 00:03:06,640
- They're pretty hot-and-heavy.
- Is that right?

54
00:03:06,807 --> 00:03:09,321
How about giving me a hand,
bring some of this stuff up?

55
00:03:09,887 --> 00:03:12,196
Sorry, Kramer.
I got to watch the hands.

56
00:03:12,367 --> 00:03:14,756
My hands are my life.

57
00:03:17,927 --> 00:03:20,316
Georgie, can you zip me up?

58
00:03:21,407 --> 00:03:22,886
Yeah.

59
00:03:23,047 --> 00:03:24,605
- Yeah, one second.
- Well, come on.

60
00:03:24,767 --> 00:03:27,281
All right. All right.
Let's not get into panic mode!

61
00:03:27,447 --> 00:03:30,405
Let's not make a big deal out of this,
or we'll never get through it.

62
00:03:30,567 --> 00:03:33,764
Well, I'm meeting your in-laws.
I think I should look nice.

63
00:03:33,927 --> 00:03:36,839
- My in-laws. Oh, my God.
- So, what do you think?

64
00:03:37,007 --> 00:03:39,123
Your old man can look good
when he wants to, huh?

65
00:03:39,287 --> 00:03:41,517
- I don't like that tie.
- What's wrong with this tie?

66
00:03:41,687 --> 00:03:43,917
- I've hardly worn it.
- It's too thin.

67
00:03:44,087 --> 00:03:45,679
They're wearing wide now.

68
00:03:46,007 --> 00:03:47,884
How do you know
what kind of ties they wear?

69
00:03:48,287 --> 00:03:51,199
Go to any office building
on Seventh Avenue...

70
00:03:51,367 --> 00:03:55,485
...and tell me if there's anyone there
wearing a thin tie like that.

71
00:03:55,647 --> 00:03:57,877
- Go ahead.
- Oh, get the hell out of here.

72
00:03:58,047 --> 00:03:59,526
Seventh Avenue?

73
00:03:59,687 --> 00:04:01,917
George, do you think
he should wear a tie like that?

74
00:04:02,767 --> 00:04:05,361
I think he should wear
whatever tie he wants.

75
00:04:05,527 --> 00:04:08,360
We gotta stop off and pick up
a marble rye from Schnitzer's.

76
00:04:08,527 --> 00:04:10,085
It's out of our way.

77
00:04:10,247 --> 00:04:13,045
Why can't we pick up something
at Lords? It's right over here.

78
00:04:13,207 --> 00:04:14,640
No, we have to go to Schnitzer's.

79
00:04:14,807 --> 00:04:17,196
I'll show these people
something about taste.

80
00:04:18,487 --> 00:04:20,557
This is gonna be fun.

81
00:04:22,167 --> 00:04:25,000
Hey, you'll never guess who
I bumped into. This guy Clyde...

82
00:04:25,167 --> 00:04:27,362
...he's in your friend
John Germaine's band there.

83
00:04:28,087 --> 00:04:29,520
- What did he have to say?
- Nothing.

84
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:32,155
I told him you two
were pretty hot-and-heavy.

85
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:35,205
"Hot-and-heavy"?

86
00:04:35,367 --> 00:04:38,598
- You said "hot-and-heavy"?
- Yeah.

87
00:04:39,167 --> 00:04:40,998
What did you do that for?

88
00:04:41,487 --> 00:04:43,603
- What?
- What if he tells John?

89
00:04:43,927 --> 00:04:46,919
Then John's gonna think that
I think that we're hot-and-heavy.

90
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:50,318
I don't want John thinking I'm
hot-and-heavy if he's not.

91
00:04:52,487 --> 00:04:56,162
I'm trying to get a little squirrel
to come over to me here.

92
00:04:56,327 --> 00:04:58,795
I don't wanna make any
big, sudden movements.

93
00:04:58,967 --> 00:05:02,482
- I'll frighten him away.
- Well, Clyde might not tell him.

94
00:05:03,207 --> 00:05:05,038
How do you know that?

95
00:05:06,767 --> 00:05:10,123
I should have helped Kramer
with those packages.

96
00:05:16,407 --> 00:05:18,079
- I'll give you a hand.
- Thanks.

97
00:05:18,247 --> 00:05:20,715
Hey, Kramer, I wonder,
could you do me a favour?

98
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:23,526
I'm taking the family
to Disney World next week.

99
00:05:23,687 --> 00:05:27,157
- I wonder, can you pick up my mail?
- Yeah, sure, sure.

100
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,797
In fact, you know what, how'd you
like my hansom-cab for the week?

101
00:05:31,167 --> 00:05:33,965
- Drive the horse?
- It'll just be sitting there.

102
00:05:34,127 --> 00:05:36,436
You can really clean up.
Five hundred bucks a day.

103
00:05:36,607 --> 00:05:38,279
I'll split it with you.

104
00:05:38,447 --> 00:05:40,244
Giddyup.

105
00:05:46,807 --> 00:05:49,037
This is delicious, Mrs. Ross.

106
00:05:49,207 --> 00:05:51,880
Why are you complimenting her?
She didn't make it. Rowena did.

107
00:05:54,647 --> 00:05:58,720
- What is this thing anyway?
- It's Cornish game hen.

108
00:05:59,087 --> 00:06:03,285
- What is that, like a little chicken?
- No, it's not a little chicken.

109
00:06:03,607 --> 00:06:07,566
- "Little chicken." No, it's a game bird.
- Game bird?

110
00:06:07,727 --> 00:06:10,764
- What do you mean, like, you hunt it?
- Yes.

111
00:06:11,327 --> 00:06:12,965
How hard can it be to kill this thing?

112
00:06:14,687 --> 00:06:18,760
I couldn't help but notice,
but you have quite a library in there.

113
00:06:19,687 --> 00:06:24,477
If I had a dime for every book
he's actually read...

114
00:06:24,647 --> 00:06:26,478
...l'd be broke.

115
00:06:28,487 --> 00:06:31,126
- More wine, anyone?
- Yeah, I'll take more. Thank you.

116
00:06:31,287 --> 00:06:33,847
- How do you like the merlot?
- Merlot? I never heard of it.

117
00:06:34,007 --> 00:06:36,646
- Did they just invent it?
- Oh, brother.

118
00:06:36,887 --> 00:06:40,084
She's heard of the merlot.

119
00:06:40,487 --> 00:06:42,284
Let me understand.

120
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:45,360
You got the hen, the chicken
and the rooster.

121
00:06:45,527 --> 00:06:47,757
The rooster goes with the chicken.

122
00:06:47,927 --> 00:06:49,804
So who's having sex with the hen?

123
00:06:50,487 --> 00:06:53,320
- We'll talk about it another time.
- But you see my point here?

124
00:06:53,487 --> 00:06:56,797
You only hear of a hen,
a rooster and a chicken.

125
00:06:57,127 --> 00:07:00,085
- Something's missing!
- Something's missing, all right.

126
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:02,762
They're all chickens.

127
00:07:02,927 --> 00:07:04,883
The rooster has sex with all of them.

128
00:07:06,647 --> 00:07:09,036
- That's perverse.
- So has anybody seen Firestorm?

129
00:07:09,207 --> 00:07:11,038
Firestorm, that's a hell of a picture.

130
00:07:11,207 --> 00:07:13,846
Remember when they had
the helicopter land on top of that car?

131
00:07:14,007 --> 00:07:15,281
Hey! I haven't seen it yet.

132
00:07:15,447 --> 00:07:18,439
- It has nothing to do with the plot!
- Still, I like to go in fresh!

133
00:07:18,967 --> 00:07:21,003
Oh, Mother of God.

134
00:07:27,167 --> 00:07:29,044
And of course, this is Central Park.

135
00:07:29,967 --> 00:07:33,516
This was designed in 1850
by Joe Pepitone...

136
00:07:34,127 --> 00:07:36,800
...built during the Civil War
so the Northern armies...

137
00:07:36,967 --> 00:07:40,323
...could practice fighting on grass.

138
00:07:42,367 --> 00:07:43,959
Oh, yeah.

139
00:07:44,887 --> 00:07:46,639
On, Rusty.

140
00:07:48,807 --> 00:07:51,879
Thank you. Now I'd like to play
something that...

141
00:07:52,047 --> 00:07:54,925
Well, actually, it's my latest,
so it's nice and fresh...

142
00:07:56,047 --> 00:07:58,003
...called "Hot-and-Heavy."

143
00:08:04,247 --> 00:08:05,680
Thank God that's over.

144
00:08:06,207 --> 00:08:10,325
The mother seems to hit the sauce
pretty hard. I didn't like that.

145
00:08:10,487 --> 00:08:13,001
And who doesn't serve cake
after a meal?

146
00:08:13,167 --> 00:08:15,123
What kind of people?

147
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:17,960
Would it kill them to put out
a pound cake? Something.

148
00:08:18,127 --> 00:08:20,243
So they didn't give you
a piece of cake. Big deal.

149
00:08:20,407 --> 00:08:23,797
It is a big deal. You're supposed
to serve cake after a meal.

150
00:08:23,967 --> 00:08:25,923
I'm sorry, it's impolite.

151
00:08:26,087 --> 00:08:28,920
It's not impolite. It's stupid,
that's what it is.

152
00:08:29,087 --> 00:08:32,762
- You gotta be stupid to do that.
- Your father is absolutely right.

153
00:08:32,927 --> 00:08:35,122
We're sitting there like idiots...

154
00:08:35,287 --> 00:08:37,847
...drinking coffee
without a piece of cake.

155
00:08:39,647 --> 00:08:41,319
What is this?

156
00:08:42,087 --> 00:08:44,317
The marble rye?

157
00:08:44,487 --> 00:08:48,719
Oh, dear, I forgot to put out
that bread they brought.

158
00:08:48,887 --> 00:08:51,879
- We forgot to bring it in.
- No, I brought it in.

159
00:08:52,047 --> 00:08:53,275
They never put it out.

160
00:08:53,447 --> 00:08:55,677
- Where is it?
- I don't know. Where'd you put it?

161
00:08:55,847 --> 00:08:58,441
- Right over there.
- Well, it's gone.

162
00:08:58,607 --> 00:08:59,756
You stole the bread?

163
00:08:59,927 --> 00:09:02,157
What do you mean?
It's my bread. They didn't eat it.

164
00:09:02,327 --> 00:09:05,444
- Why should I leave it there?
- Because we brought it for them.

165
00:09:05,607 --> 00:09:08,326
Apparently it wasn't good enough
for them to serve.

166
00:09:08,487 --> 00:09:10,318
Is it possible they took it back?

167
00:09:10,487 --> 00:09:12,557
Who would bring a bread
and take it back?

168
00:09:12,727 --> 00:09:15,241
Those people, that's who.
I think they're sick.

169
00:09:15,407 --> 00:09:18,843
- People take buses to get that rye.
- Maybe they forgot to put it out.

170
00:09:19,007 --> 00:09:21,601
No, they didn't forget to put it out.
It's deliberate.

171
00:09:21,767 --> 00:09:24,122
Deliberate, I tell you!

172
00:09:29,327 --> 00:09:32,285
- He stole back the rye?
- Yeah.

173
00:09:32,527 --> 00:09:34,961
- Why?
- Why? Why?

174
00:09:35,127 --> 00:09:37,687
Because he's off his rocker,
that's why.

175
00:09:37,847 --> 00:09:41,203
- So do the Rosses know?
- They're all very suspicious.

176
00:09:41,367 --> 00:09:43,722
Why wouldn't they be?
Rye bread doesn't just disappear.

177
00:09:43,887 --> 00:09:48,722
Now because of that rye, I gotta keep
them separated for the rest of my life.

178
00:09:49,687 --> 00:09:51,757
Bad situation.

179
00:09:52,167 --> 00:09:54,965
I tell you what I'd like to do.
I'd like to replace that rye.

180
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:57,960
- What do you mean, replace it?
- You know, go out, get another rye.

181
00:09:58,127 --> 00:10:00,766
Of course, it would have to be
the same one from Schnitzer's.

182
00:10:00,927 --> 00:10:04,078
You put it in the kitchen somewhere
and say, "Oh, there it is."

183
00:10:04,247 --> 00:10:06,602
Well, there you go.
What's so hard about that?

184
00:10:06,767 --> 00:10:09,645
What's so hard about that?
I can't just walk in with it.

185
00:10:09,807 --> 00:10:13,243
- I have to get the Rosses out of there.
- All right. Don't panic.

186
00:10:13,407 --> 00:10:15,477
Let's just think about it.

187
00:10:15,767 --> 00:10:18,327
The Rosses out of the apartment.
Can't be so hard.

188
00:10:18,487 --> 00:10:21,081
Wait a minute. Wait a second.
Wait a second.

189
00:10:21,247 --> 00:10:23,283
You know, Kramer's
been driving that hansom-cab.

190
00:10:23,767 --> 00:10:26,327
- So?
- He'll take them around for a while.

191
00:10:27,807 --> 00:10:30,162
And it's their anniversary
Friday night.

192
00:10:30,327 --> 00:10:31,999
I can send them
for a hansom-cab ride.

193
00:10:32,167 --> 00:10:34,078
- You think they'd like that?
- People love it.

194
00:10:34,247 --> 00:10:36,807
There's something about
the clip-clop. They're nuts for it.

195
00:10:36,967 --> 00:10:39,197
So they go. When they
come back, the bread is there.

196
00:10:39,367 --> 00:10:41,005
- What about Susan?
- She's working late.

197
00:10:41,167 --> 00:10:44,477
We're suppose to have dinner at 8:00,
so I'll set up the rye for 7:00.

198
00:10:44,647 --> 00:10:47,366
- Beautiful.
- You think Kramer will do it?

199
00:10:47,527 --> 00:10:49,643
Of course I'll do it. I'd be happy to.

200
00:10:49,807 --> 00:10:51,877
- So I gotta be there at 7?
- Just take them out...

201
00:10:52,047 --> 00:10:54,277
...and ride around for half an hour.
- Sounds easy.

202
00:10:57,127 --> 00:10:59,880
- What the hell are you doing there?
- That's Beef- a-Reeno.

203
00:11:00,047 --> 00:11:01,526
And I got 50 cans.

204
00:11:01,687 --> 00:11:04,565
- Well, do you want some?
- No. No, thanks.

205
00:11:04,727 --> 00:11:08,037
Jerry, I think I bought too much
at that Price Club.

206
00:11:08,207 --> 00:11:10,163
I don't have any room for it all.

207
00:11:10,327 --> 00:11:11,601
Hold on. Wait a minute.

208
00:11:11,767 --> 00:11:13,962
How am I gonna get the rye bread
into the apartment?

209
00:11:14,127 --> 00:11:16,595
- Put it under your shirt.
- Have you seen a Schnitzer's rye?

210
00:11:16,767 --> 00:11:19,361
- It's huge.
- I tell you what, I'll bring it over.

211
00:11:19,527 --> 00:11:23,122
I'll stop by Schnitzer's,
I'll come by right after they leave.

212
00:11:24,007 --> 00:11:27,602
Oh, well, this is all locking in now.
It is all locking in.

213
00:11:28,327 --> 00:11:30,761
- Hey. Is that your horse outside?
- That's Rusty.

214
00:11:30,927 --> 00:11:33,521
Why, he's outside?
Come on, I wanna see him.

215
00:11:33,687 --> 00:11:36,838
- Let's go. I'll show you the horsie.
- Laney, wanna see the horsie?

216
00:11:40,007 --> 00:11:42,441
You really did me in this time,
didn't you?

217
00:11:42,607 --> 00:11:47,283
First guy I like in a really long time.
I mean, we're getting along...

218
00:11:47,447 --> 00:11:49,563
... everything is just...

219
00:11:49,727 --> 00:11:54,801
- great. I mean, all right,
so he doesn't do everything...

220
00:11:55,207 --> 00:11:59,280
...and then you have to come along
with your "hot" and your "heavy."

221
00:11:59,447 --> 00:12:02,644
- So you think Clyde told him?
- He wrote a song about it.

222
00:12:02,807 --> 00:12:05,367
- Well, maybe it's a good thing.
- No, it's not a good thing.

223
00:12:05,527 --> 00:12:06,801
It's a bad thing.

224
00:12:06,967 --> 00:12:11,245
Do you know what this is like, to have
no control over a relationship?

225
00:12:11,407 --> 00:12:14,558
And you feel sick to your stomach
all the time?

226
00:12:14,727 --> 00:12:17,878
- Do you know what that's like?
- No, no.

227
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:21,756
But I've read articles, and I must say,
it doesn't sound very pleasant.

228
00:12:21,927 --> 00:12:23,519
You know, one of these days...

229
00:12:23,687 --> 00:12:27,600
...something terrible
is gonna happen to you.

230
00:12:28,087 --> 00:12:31,079
- It has to.
- No, I'm gonna be just fine.

231
00:12:31,247 --> 00:12:33,681
But as far as your situation,
you're seeing him tonight...

232
00:12:33,847 --> 00:12:36,407
...so talk to him about it.
- I can't.

233
00:12:36,567 --> 00:12:40,242
He's got a big showcase for record
producers at his late show tonight.

234
00:12:40,407 --> 00:12:44,605
I don't wanna upset him.
Oh, what the hell, I'll upset him.

235
00:12:46,367 --> 00:12:48,881
George, I gotta tell you,
this is a very nice gesture.

236
00:12:49,047 --> 00:12:51,925
- We really appreciate it.
- Well, it's your anniversary.

237
00:12:52,087 --> 00:12:53,566
It's the least I can do.

238
00:12:53,727 --> 00:12:56,878
I just want you guys to go out
and have a good time.

239
00:12:57,047 --> 00:12:59,117
So you think we should
get downstairs?

240
00:12:59,287 --> 00:13:00,959
We got about 20 minutes.

241
00:13:01,287 --> 00:13:04,404
You seem a little nervous, George.
Anything wrong?

242
00:13:04,567 --> 00:13:08,401
Oh, no. No, no, no. Nothing.
I'm fine. Everything's fine. Fine.

243
00:13:08,567 --> 00:13:11,161
Just get a little nervous
on the weekends, that's all.

244
00:13:11,447 --> 00:13:14,644
- Could I get a glass of water?
- We've got water.

245
00:13:14,807 --> 00:13:18,482
I don't think we have any bread,
but we've got water.

246
00:13:21,527 --> 00:13:24,405
There you go, big fella.
That's Beef- a-Reeno.

247
00:13:24,567 --> 00:13:27,479
I'm so k een-o
On Beef-a-Reeno

248
00:13:27,647 --> 00:13:31,117
What a delicious cuisine-o
Fit for a king and queen-o

249
00:13:31,487 --> 00:13:34,877
Yeah, eat up.
I got 34 more cans.

250
00:13:38,967 --> 00:13:41,527
Nice night for a
hansom-cab ride, eh, George?

251
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:45,157
You know, George,
we haven't done anything...

252
00:13:45,327 --> 00:13:49,957
...romantic like this in years.

253
00:13:51,087 --> 00:13:53,123
Oh, my God. It's 7:01.

254
00:13:53,287 --> 00:13:55,926
What have I done? My whole plan
is depending on Kramer?

255
00:13:56,087 --> 00:13:57,839
Have I learned nothing?

256
00:13:58,007 --> 00:13:59,838
How could I have made
such a stupid mistak e?

257
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:01,998
He'll never show up.

258
00:14:07,207 --> 00:14:10,563
There he is. Right on time,
as usual.

259
00:14:12,207 --> 00:14:14,960
- Fifty-three.
- Fifty-three.

260
00:14:15,127 --> 00:14:18,005
I'd like a marble rye.
No plastic. In a bag.

261
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,164
You're lucky, it's our last one.

262
00:14:20,847 --> 00:14:22,724
Wait a second,
that's your last marble rye?

263
00:14:22,887 --> 00:14:24,718
- That's right.
- There's none left?

264
00:14:24,887 --> 00:14:27,117
That's what I said.

265
00:14:27,687 --> 00:14:29,040
Number 54.

266
00:14:30,087 --> 00:14:31,759
Excuse me.

267
00:14:31,927 --> 00:14:34,725
I know this is gonna sound crazy,
but I have to have that rye.

268
00:14:34,887 --> 00:14:38,482
It's a long story, but a person's
whole future may depend on it.

269
00:14:38,647 --> 00:14:41,036
Well, I'm sorry, but you should've
got here earlier.

270
00:14:41,207 --> 00:14:43,357
Yes, well, be that as it may...

271
00:14:43,527 --> 00:14:46,087
...if you could just find it
within yourself to give it up...

272
00:14:46,247 --> 00:14:49,364
- You're not getting this rye.
- All right. All right.

273
00:14:49,527 --> 00:14:50,880
I'll tell what I'm gonna do.

274
00:14:51,047 --> 00:14:53,277
I will give you double
what you paid for it.

275
00:14:53,447 --> 00:14:55,756
You're in my way.

276
00:14:58,967 --> 00:15:01,527
Mr. Ross, Mrs. Ross,
my name is Cosmo...

277
00:15:01,687 --> 00:15:03,439
...and I'll be your driver this evening.

278
00:15:03,607 --> 00:15:06,326
We have blankets for your comfort.
I also have hot chocolate...

279
00:15:06,487 --> 00:15:09,206
...if the mood should strike you.
- My favourite.

280
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:12,040
Well, if we're all set to go,
why don't you two hop aboard...

281
00:15:12,207 --> 00:15:15,722
...and let me show you
a little taste of old New York...

282
00:15:15,887 --> 00:15:17,320
...the way it once was.

283
00:15:18,367 --> 00:15:19,720
Happy anniversary.

284
00:15:19,967 --> 00:15:21,036
On, Rusty!

285
00:15:31,407 --> 00:15:34,524
All right. Look, I'll tell
you what, I'll give you $50.

286
00:15:34,687 --> 00:15:39,238
Now, be reasonable. You cannot
turn down $50 for a $6 rye.

287
00:15:39,527 --> 00:15:41,358
No? Watch me.

288
00:15:41,967 --> 00:15:43,605
- Give me that rye.
- Stop it.

289
00:15:43,767 --> 00:15:46,486
- I want that rye, lady.
- Help! Someone help!

290
00:15:46,647 --> 00:15:49,366
- Shut up, you old bag.
- Stop, thief!

291
00:15:49,527 --> 00:15:52,724
Stop him! Stop him,
he's got my marble rye.

292
00:15:54,407 --> 00:15:56,557
I'm sorry to just show up
unexpectedly like this.

293
00:15:56,727 --> 00:15:59,116
I know you've got your big
showcase coming up later.

294
00:15:59,287 --> 00:16:02,324
I know how important it is. I know
how hard you've worked for this...

295
00:16:02,487 --> 00:16:06,799
...but I just had too tell you that
I never told Jerry "hot-and-heavy."

296
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:10,596
I didn't think we were hot-and-heavy.
I mean, who's hot and who's heavy?

297
00:16:10,767 --> 00:16:12,485
Hold on, Elaine.

298
00:16:12,807 --> 00:16:15,446
- I'm kind of disappointed.
- Disappointed?

299
00:16:15,887 --> 00:16:17,525
Yeah, I mean...

300
00:16:17,807 --> 00:16:19,763
...I was excited
when Clyde told me that.

301
00:16:20,807 --> 00:16:22,923
- You were?
- Absolutely.

302
00:16:27,607 --> 00:16:29,518
I am so relieved.

303
00:16:29,687 --> 00:16:34,761
Listen, I've still got a couple of hours
to kill before the next show.

304
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:37,157
My place is only a few blocks
from here.

305
00:16:38,447 --> 00:16:40,085
- Really?
- Yeah.

306
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:43,964
And you know what,
I've been thinking about what we do...

307
00:16:44,127 --> 00:16:47,085
...and I'm thinking of...

308
00:16:47,567 --> 00:16:51,765
...adding a new number to my,
you know, repertoire.

309
00:17:19,167 --> 00:17:20,919
What is that?

310
00:17:22,327 --> 00:17:25,239
I think it's the horse.

311
00:17:25,407 --> 00:17:26,635
Oh, my God.

312
00:17:27,127 --> 00:17:29,641
How's everything?
You need anything?

313
00:17:29,807 --> 00:17:32,560
This is really intolerable.

314
00:17:32,727 --> 00:17:35,287
Excuse me.
What do you feed this animal?

315
00:17:35,447 --> 00:17:37,403
Oh, you know, oats and hay.

316
00:17:37,567 --> 00:17:40,286
Yeah, they like that stuff.

317
00:17:41,367 --> 00:17:42,561
I can't take this.

318
00:17:46,247 --> 00:17:48,078
Get me out of this thing!

319
00:17:48,247 --> 00:17:52,877
Turn this thing around. We've had it.
We can't breathe back here.

320
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:56,883
- And hurry it up.
- Rusty!

321
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,204
Rusty!

322
00:18:20,887 --> 00:18:23,003
What happened?
What are you doing back so soon?

323
00:18:23,167 --> 00:18:26,159
- Ask Rusty.
- I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Ross.

324
00:18:26,327 --> 00:18:29,842
One never knows how the intestinal
workings of the equine will function.

325
00:18:30,007 --> 00:18:33,966
Thanks for nothing. Come on,
George, let's go upstairs.

326
00:18:34,127 --> 00:18:37,164
- What the hell happened?
- The horse is gassy.

327
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:40,604
- Must've been the Beef- a-Reeno.
- Beef- a-Reeno?

328
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:44,157
- You fed the horse Beef- a-Reeno?
- Well, I overbought.

329
00:18:44,327 --> 00:18:45,840
George!

330
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,965
What's going on? Where is he?

331
00:19:00,207 --> 00:19:02,163
- He'll be here soon.
- I'll give him 10 minutes.

332
00:19:02,327 --> 00:19:04,283
I'm not gonna stay here all night.

333
00:19:07,127 --> 00:19:09,197
- How much did you give him?
- Just a can.

334
00:19:09,367 --> 00:19:13,645
- He really liked it, though.
- Jerry, up here.

335
00:19:13,807 --> 00:19:15,763
Yeah, what do you
want me to do with this?

336
00:19:15,927 --> 00:19:18,316
I can't come out. They're
right by the door. Throw it.

337
00:19:18,487 --> 00:19:21,957
- Really?
- Yeah, it's the only way. Come on.

338
00:19:24,047 --> 00:19:25,196
What, are you kidding me?!

339
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:28,035
Can you get this horse
out of here? He's killing me.

340
00:19:28,207 --> 00:19:31,244
- I don't wanna go back on there.
- Come on.

341
00:19:45,047 --> 00:19:47,322
Hey, hey. Wait a second.

342
00:19:47,487 --> 00:19:49,239
I got an idea.

343
00:19:50,727 --> 00:19:53,525
No, no. Don't be silly, John.
You were very good.

344
00:19:53,807 --> 00:19:56,719
You just don't have to try so hard.

345
00:19:56,967 --> 00:19:59,037
Good luck, honey.

346
00:20:00,847 --> 00:20:03,680
- Come on. Come on.
- Would you just wait a second.

347
00:20:03,847 --> 00:20:06,520
I never baited a hook
with a rye before.

348
00:20:07,007 --> 00:20:10,317
Your hook is too small.
This is for, like, a muffin.

349
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:12,646
All right, take it away.

350
00:20:18,487 --> 00:20:19,761
Come on.

351
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,485
Yeah. Yeah.

352
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:40,085
Schnitzer's.

353
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:52,722
Ladies and gentlemen,
John Germaine.
