1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,634
<i>Every morning, when you wake up,
it's like you're born all over again.</i>

2
00:00:07,157 --> 00:00:09,193
<i>You can't see, you can't talk.</i>

3
00:00:09,357 --> 00:00:12,429
<i>You're on your way to the bathroom
trying to remember, "How do I walk?"</i>

4
00:00:12,597 --> 00:00:14,110
<i>Like you've never
been alive before.</i>

5
00:00:14,277 --> 00:00:16,950
<i>But if any invention marks
the decline of human civilization...</i>

6
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:18,835
<i>...it would have to be
the snooze alarm.</i>

7
00:00:18,997 --> 00:00:20,669
<i>The snooze alarm
is based on the idea...</i>

8
00:00:20,837 --> 00:00:23,590
<i>...that when the alarm goes off,
you are not getting up.</i>

9
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:26,191
<i>You're not even awake,
you're already a failure.</i>

10
00:00:26,357 --> 00:00:29,269
<i>They should sell the snooze alarm
with an unemployment application...</i>

11
00:00:29,437 --> 00:00:30,711
<i>...and a bottle of tequila.</i>

12
00:00:30,877 --> 00:00:34,347
<i>Just make it a complete
pathetic-loser kit.</i>

13
00:00:46,037 --> 00:00:48,392
<i>- Hello.
- This is your wake-up service.</i>

14
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:53,392
Oh, God.

15
00:00:53,557 --> 00:00:56,947
<i>Oh, I could use
a few more hours sleep.</i>

16
00:00:57,117 --> 00:01:00,234
<i>- Hot date last night?
- I wish.</i>

17
00:01:00,397 --> 00:01:02,035
<i>A woman with a sexy voice
lik e yours...</i>

18
00:01:02,197 --> 00:01:04,836
<i>...it's hard to believe
you're waking up alone.</i>

19
00:01:06,157 --> 00:01:07,715
<i>Really?</i>

20
00:01:07,877 --> 00:01:09,071
Thank you...

21
00:01:09,237 --> 00:01:12,912
<i>...Tri-State Wake-Up Service
person.</i>

22
00:01:13,077 --> 00:01:17,548
<i>- Cal me James.
- Oh, all right, James.</i>

23
00:01:20,477 --> 00:01:22,149
<i>The wake-up guy asked you out?</i>

24
00:01:22,317 --> 00:01:23,466
<i>Yeah, I've never seen him...</i>

25
00:01:23,637 --> 00:01:26,834
<i>...but I feel like we have
this weirdly intimate relationship.</i>

26
00:01:26,997 --> 00:01:29,147
<i>You know, I mean, I'm lying in bed.</i>

27
00:01:29,317 --> 00:01:31,114
<i>I'm wearing my nightie.</i>

28
00:01:31,277 --> 00:01:32,596
<i>I don't know. A blind date?</i>

29
00:01:33,157 --> 00:01:35,796
<i>You wanna go out with
my cousin Holly. You've never met her.</i>

30
00:01:35,957 --> 00:01:37,549
<i>Yeah, but I've seen pictures of her.</i>

31
00:01:37,717 --> 00:01:39,275
<i>At least I've spoken to my guy.</i>

32
00:01:39,437 --> 00:01:41,667
<i>You're going out on a deaf date.</i>

33
00:01:41,837 --> 00:01:44,192
<i>I think I'd rather go on a deaf date
than a blind date.</i>

34
00:01:44,357 --> 00:01:47,315
<i>The question is, would you rather
date the blind or the deaf?</i>

35
00:01:47,477 --> 00:01:49,513
<i>- Now, you're off on a topic.
- That's interesting.</i>

36
00:01:49,677 --> 00:01:52,669
<i>See, now, I think
I would rather date the deaf.</i>

37
00:01:52,837 --> 00:01:54,031
<i>Because I think the blind...</i>

38
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,586
<i>...would probably be
a little messy around the house.</i>

39
00:01:56,757 --> 00:01:59,829
<i>I mean, let's face it,
they're not gonna get all the crumbs.</i>

40
00:01:59,997 --> 00:02:02,033
<i>You're constantly
walking around with a sponge.</i>

41
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:05,306
<i>See, I disagree.
I would rather date the blind.</i>

42
00:02:05,477 --> 00:02:08,947
<i>You know, you could let the house go,
you let yourself go.</i>

43
00:02:09,557 --> 00:02:10,831
A good-looking blind woman...

44
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:13,067
<i>...doesn't know
you're not good enough for her.</i>

45
00:02:13,237 --> 00:02:15,467
<i>I think she'd figure it out
soon enough.</i>

46
00:02:17,597 --> 00:02:19,110
What?

47
00:02:19,277 --> 00:02:20,756
What is this?

48
00:02:20,917 --> 00:02:23,477
<i>Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit.</i>

49
00:02:23,637 --> 00:02:26,515
<i>Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit?
What are you turning into?</i>

50
00:02:26,677 --> 00:02:28,633
<i>A healthy person.</i>

51
00:02:30,677 --> 00:02:32,872
<i>- You squirted me.
- Oh, sorry.</i>

52
00:02:33,037 --> 00:02:35,107
Boy, that stings.

53
00:02:38,037 --> 00:02:40,187
<i>George, have you seen Morgan?</i>

54
00:02:40,597 --> 00:02:42,713
<i>- No.
- He's been coming in later and later.</i>

55
00:02:42,877 --> 00:02:46,506
<i>- Is there something wrong?
- No, not that I know of.</i>

56
00:02:47,637 --> 00:02:49,195
<i>Really?</i>

57
00:02:49,357 --> 00:02:50,631
<i>Well, make sure he signs this.</i>

58
00:02:50,797 --> 00:02:53,470
<i>George, if there's a problem
with Morgan, you can tell me.</i>

59
00:02:53,637 --> 00:02:56,105
<i>Morgan? No, he's doing a great job.</i>

60
00:02:56,797 --> 00:02:58,196
<i>I understand.</i>

61
00:03:00,877 --> 00:03:03,186
<i>I still can't believe
you're going out on a blind date.</i>

62
00:03:03,357 --> 00:03:05,666
<i>I'm not worried.
He sounds like he's good-looking.</i>

63
00:03:06,517 --> 00:03:09,350
<i>You're going by sound?
What are we, whales?</i>

64
00:03:10,397 --> 00:03:11,591
<i>I think I can tell.</i>

65
00:03:11,757 --> 00:03:13,827
<i>What percentage of people
are good-looking?</i>

66
00:03:13,997 --> 00:03:16,511
<i>- Twenty-five percent.
- Twenty-five percent?</i>

67
00:03:16,677 --> 00:03:19,111
<i>No way. It's like 4 to 6 percent.</i>

68
00:03:19,277 --> 00:03:20,596
It's a 20-1 shot.

69
00:03:20,757 --> 00:03:22,395
<i>- You're way off.
- Way off?</i>

70
00:03:22,557 --> 00:03:26,106
<i>You been to the Motor Vehicle Bureau?
It's a leper colony down there.</i>

71
00:03:26,877 --> 00:03:28,754
<i>So basically, what you're saying...</i>

72
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,226
<i>...is 95 percent of the population
is undateable?</i>

73
00:03:31,397 --> 00:03:33,035
<i>Undateable.</i>

74
00:03:33,197 --> 00:03:35,153
<i>Then how are all these people
getting together?</i>

75
00:03:35,317 --> 00:03:36,830
Alcohol.

76
00:03:37,277 --> 00:03:38,471
<i>What is your problem?</i>

77
00:03:39,717 --> 00:03:41,673
<i>No problem here.</i>

78
00:03:41,837 --> 00:03:44,112
<i>You keep winking at me.
That's really obnoxious.</i>

79
00:03:44,877 --> 00:03:47,710
<i>- I had no idea.
- Right there. You just did it again.</i>

80
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:49,665
<i>Wait a minute. Wait a minute.</i>

81
00:03:49,837 --> 00:03:51,907
<i>It's from that grapefruit
Jerry squirted at me.</i>

82
00:03:52,077 --> 00:03:53,396
<i>Oh, your eye still hurts?</i>

83
00:03:53,557 --> 00:03:57,027
<i>Yeah, yeah, you must have squirted
a piece of pulp in it too.</i>

84
00:03:57,197 --> 00:03:58,835
<i>Pulp couldn't make it
across the table.</i>

85
00:03:58,997 --> 00:04:01,113
<i>Pulp can move, baby.</i>

86
00:04:01,597 --> 00:04:03,110
<i>Why can't you eat a real breakfast?</i>

87
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:05,996
<i>I eat healthy. If I have to take out
an eye, that's the breaks.</i>

88
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:09,511
<i>Wait a minute. I must have
been winking down at the office.</i>

89
00:04:09,677 --> 00:04:12,032
<i>That's why Mr. Wilhelm
was acting so misterioso.</i>

90
00:04:13,237 --> 00:04:16,070
<i>What did he think,
you were flirting with him?</i>

91
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:19,312
<i>No, he thought I was hiding
something about Morgan.</i>

92
00:04:20,797 --> 00:04:22,833
<i>- Hey, guys.
- Hi, Jughead.</i>

93
00:04:22,997 --> 00:04:26,307
<i>Hello, Archie, Veronica,
Mr. Weatherbee.</i>

94
00:04:28,397 --> 00:04:29,876
<i>Hey.</i>

95
00:04:30,357 --> 00:04:32,507
<i>- Is this Don Mattingly's signature?
- Yeah.</i>

96
00:04:32,677 --> 00:04:33,871
<i>And Buck Showalter's?</i>

97
00:04:34,037 --> 00:04:37,313
<i>It's an interoffice envelope. It gets
passed around all over the office.</i>

98
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:39,149
<i>Hey, can I show this
to my buddy Stubs?</i>

99
00:04:39,317 --> 00:04:40,830
<i>He runs a sports-memorabilia store.</i>

100
00:04:40,997 --> 00:04:42,669
<i>He'll pay top-dollar
for pro autographs.</i>

101
00:04:43,397 --> 00:04:46,116
<i>Yeah, like I'm gonna risk my job
with the New York Yankees...</i>

102
00:04:46,277 --> 00:04:47,790
<i>...to make a few extra bucks.</i>

103
00:04:47,957 --> 00:04:49,310
<i>No, of course not.</i>

104
00:04:52,437 --> 00:04:54,826
<i>No, you see, Don Mattingly
signed this envelope.</i>

105
00:04:54,997 --> 00:04:56,794
<i>Then he sent it to room 318...</i>

106
00:04:56,957 --> 00:05:00,233
<i>...where it was received and signed for
by manager Buck Showalter.</i>

107
00:05:00,397 --> 00:05:02,388
<i>I don't know. An envelope?</i>

108
00:05:02,557 --> 00:05:04,275
<i>- It doesn't really cut it.
- Why?</i>

109
00:05:04,677 --> 00:05:06,315
And what is this?

110
00:05:06,477 --> 00:05:08,433
A birthday card.

111
00:05:08,597 --> 00:05:11,873
<i>Signed by the entire
Yankee organization?</i>

112
00:05:13,437 --> 00:05:14,995
<i>This could be worth something.</i>

113
00:05:15,637 --> 00:05:17,867
<i>- Is that the lovely Mrs. Morgan?
- Hello.</i>

114
00:05:18,037 --> 00:05:19,595
You got that birthday card?

115
00:05:20,597 --> 00:05:23,350
<i>- Birthday card?
- Mr. Steinbrenner's birthday card.</i>

116
00:05:23,517 --> 00:05:25,314
<i>Wilhelm said you'd have it
for me to sign.</i>

117
00:05:25,477 --> 00:05:29,356
<i>Oh, yeah. I'll have that for you
right after lunch.</i>

118
00:05:29,517 --> 00:05:33,066
<i>- Fine. I'll be back after my massage.
- Of course, your massage.</i>

119
00:05:33,237 --> 00:05:35,387
<i>Enjoy your massage.</i>

120
00:05:47,717 --> 00:05:49,389
<i>- Hello?
- Elaine?</i>

121
00:05:50,077 --> 00:05:52,147
<i>- James.
- Yes.</i>

122
00:05:53,277 --> 00:05:55,108
<i>Hello.</i>

123
00:05:59,637 --> 00:06:01,548
<i>I can't believe Elaine's
never taken you here.</i>

124
00:06:01,717 --> 00:06:03,389
<i>I'm really not
much of a meat eater.</i>

125
00:06:04,157 --> 00:06:05,272
<i>You don't eat meat?</i>

126
00:06:05,437 --> 00:06:07,871
<i>- What are you, one of those-?
- No, I'm not one of those.</i>

127
00:06:09,757 --> 00:06:10,951
<i>When we were little girls...</i>

128
00:06:11,117 --> 00:06:13,711
<i>...Grandma Mema would take us
to a matinee and dinner here.</i>

129
00:06:13,877 --> 00:06:16,755
<i>- Grandma Mema?
- Elaine must have mentioned Mema.</i>

130
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:18,748
<i>No, I think I would have
remembered Mema.</i>

131
00:06:18,917 --> 00:06:21,511
<i>Oh, well, that's typical.
Elaine never liked Grandma Mema.</i>

132
00:06:21,917 --> 00:06:23,111
<i>Ready?</i>

133
00:06:23,277 --> 00:06:26,474
<i>I'll have the porterhouse, medium rare,
baked potato with sour cream.</i>

134
00:06:26,997 --> 00:06:28,749
<i>What do you recommended
besides a steak?</i>

135
00:06:28,917 --> 00:06:30,669
<i>The lamb chops are good.</i>

136
00:06:30,837 --> 00:06:33,829
<i>Anything lighter?
How do you prepare the chicken?</i>

137
00:06:33,997 --> 00:06:37,148
<i>It's a full bird, stuffed with ham,
topped with Gorgonzola.</i>

138
00:06:38,637 --> 00:06:40,036
<i>You know, I'll just have a salad.</i>

139
00:06:43,117 --> 00:06:44,869
Thank you.

140
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:46,516
<i>Just a salad.</i>

141
00:06:46,677 --> 00:06:48,156
<i>Just a salad.</i>

142
00:06:48,317 --> 00:06:49,670
<i>Just a salad.</i>

143
00:06:49,837 --> 00:06:51,429
<i>Here you are. Hey, boys.</i>

144
00:06:51,597 --> 00:06:53,235
<i>Hey, you. Hey, you. Hi.</i>

145
00:06:54,237 --> 00:06:55,431
<i>These are your dogs?</i>

146
00:06:55,597 --> 00:06:57,872
<i>Yeah, when you live alone,
your dogs are all you have.</i>

147
00:06:58,037 --> 00:06:59,755
<i>Do you like dogs?</i>

148
00:07:00,197 --> 00:07:05,351
<i>Shut up, you stupid little mutt!</i>

149
00:07:06,157 --> 00:07:10,275
<i>- Dogs? Oh, I love dogs.
- Boys, this is Elaine.</i>

150
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,906
<i>I'm sorry.
They're usually very friendly.</i>

151
00:07:17,077 --> 00:07:18,476
<i>Hey.</i>

152
00:07:19,997 --> 00:07:22,147
<i>Hey, Mr. Morgan,
how was your massage?</i>

153
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:25,150
<i>I had to cancel it. For some reason
my wife got it into her head...</i>

154
00:07:25,317 --> 00:07:26,989
<i>...that it was more
than just a massage.</i>

155
00:07:27,717 --> 00:07:30,026
<i>- Really?
- We got into this big fight at lunch.</i>

156
00:07:30,197 --> 00:07:32,791
<i>- I'll be sleeping on the couch.
- Listen, don't oversleep.</i>

157
00:07:32,957 --> 00:07:34,834
<i>- You can't afford to be late again.
- I know.</i>

158
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:38,706
<i>Somebody's been giving Wilhelm
the impression I've been slacking off.</i>

159
00:07:39,197 --> 00:07:42,030
<i>Hey, you know, you should try
my friend's wake-up service.</i>

160
00:07:42,197 --> 00:07:43,550
<i>She's swears by this thing.</i>

161
00:07:43,717 --> 00:07:45,389
<i>You may be my only friend
around here.</i>

162
00:07:45,557 --> 00:07:48,594
<i>- By the way, you got that card?
- Not yet.</i>

163
00:07:48,757 --> 00:07:50,952
<i>Make sure Steinbrenner
doesn't get it till I sign it.</i>

164
00:07:51,117 --> 00:07:52,106
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

165
00:07:52,397 --> 00:07:54,069
<i>I mean, I just don't understand it.</i>

166
00:07:54,237 --> 00:07:57,035
<i>As soon as I met these dogs,
they started growling at me.</i>

167
00:07:57,197 --> 00:08:01,110
<i>Well, maybe his dogs heard about
how you tried to kidnap that other dog.</i>

168
00:08:01,277 --> 00:08:03,666
<i>These mutts like to gossip.</i>

169
00:08:03,877 --> 00:08:05,071
<i>So have you talked to Holly?</i>

170
00:08:06,197 --> 00:08:07,550
<i>Did she mention our lunch?</i>

171
00:08:08,437 --> 00:08:10,746
<i>- Kind of.
- Well, what do you mean, "Kind of"?</i>

172
00:08:11,637 --> 00:08:15,550
<i>I mean, she thought it was
kind of strange to just order a salad.</i>

173
00:08:15,957 --> 00:08:19,427
You know, for a man.

174
00:08:20,557 --> 00:08:22,513
<i>Like a quiche thing?</i>

175
00:08:23,157 --> 00:08:24,909
<i>You're in the ballpark.</i>

176
00:08:25,077 --> 00:08:26,590
Salad? What was I thinking?

177
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:28,429
<i>Women don't respect salad eaters.</i>

178
00:08:28,597 --> 00:08:30,189
You got that right.

179
00:08:30,357 --> 00:08:32,917
<i>You're going over there
for dinner tonight, right?</i>

180
00:08:33,077 --> 00:08:37,070
<i>- What is she making?
- I don't know. I'm sure it had parents.</i>

181
00:08:40,117 --> 00:08:41,755
<i>Call her up.
She won't mind if you come.</i>

182
00:08:41,917 --> 00:08:45,307
<i>Oh, don't worry, I'll be there.
And I'll be packing an artery.</i>

183
00:08:48,397 --> 00:08:50,194
<i>Well, Mr. Weatherbee.</i>

184
00:08:51,037 --> 00:08:52,436
<i>Do you have
that Yankee envelope?</i>

185
00:08:52,797 --> 00:08:54,310
<i>I sure do.</i>

186
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,550
<i>- There you are.
- Hey.</i>

187
00:08:56,717 --> 00:08:59,390
<i>Think you're gonna be very pleased
when you see what's inside.</i>

188
00:09:01,477 --> 00:09:03,707
<i>- What is this?
- Your cut of the loot.</i>

189
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,071
<i>Stubs gave me $200...</i>

190
00:09:05,237 --> 00:09:07,546
<i>...for the autographed birthday card
that was inside.</i>

191
00:09:07,717 --> 00:09:09,230
<i>Who told you to sell the card?</i>

192
00:09:10,837 --> 00:09:13,271
- You did.
- No, I didn't.

193
00:09:13,437 --> 00:09:14,665
<i>Well, not in so many words...</i>

194
00:09:14,837 --> 00:09:17,351
<i>...but I believe
we had an understanding.</i>

195
00:09:18,437 --> 00:09:20,075
I was not winking, you idiot.

196
00:09:20,237 --> 00:09:22,193
<i>That was the grapefruit.
It's like acid.</i>

197
00:09:22,357 --> 00:09:25,155
<i>I need that card back.
It's Steinbrenner's. I was responsible.</i>

198
00:09:25,317 --> 00:09:28,275
<i>Well, Stubs sold it to some guy
whose kid is in the hospital.</i>

199
00:09:28,437 --> 00:09:31,235
<i>Well, get it back.
It's very important.</i>

200
00:09:32,677 --> 00:09:34,429
<i>Look, you want me
to get it back or not?</i>

201
00:09:35,037 --> 00:09:37,346
<i>Get it back!</i>

202
00:09:38,397 --> 00:09:41,389
<i>This is such a lovely
table setting, Holly.</i>

203
00:09:41,557 --> 00:09:44,196
<i>- Where did you get these napkins?
- They were Grandma Mema's.</i>

204
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,509
<i>- I don't remember them.
- You wouldn't.</i>

205
00:09:46,677 --> 00:09:49,191
<i>She only used them
on special occasions.</i>

206
00:09:50,317 --> 00:09:52,877
<i>Special occasions? It wasn't special
when my family visited?</i>

207
00:09:53,037 --> 00:09:55,597
<i>Everybody like mutton?</i>

208
00:09:56,357 --> 00:09:58,029
Mutton.

209
00:09:58,797 --> 00:10:01,186
<i>Hope you didn't cut the fat off.</i>

210
00:10:04,397 --> 00:10:06,627
<i>- Are you Bobby?
- Yes.</i>

211
00:10:07,157 --> 00:10:10,194
<i>Well, I heard that you have
a very special birthday card...</i>

212
00:10:10,357 --> 00:10:12,427
<i>...with all the Yankee
autographs on it.</i>

213
00:10:12,597 --> 00:10:15,828
<i>- Sure do, mister.
- Oh, boy. Yeah, yeah, that's it. Yeah.</i>

214
00:10:15,997 --> 00:10:18,192
<i>Boy, Stubs sure went to town
with this thing, huh?</i>

215
00:10:18,357 --> 00:10:20,552
<i>Yeah, well, Bobby,
what if I told you...</i>

216
00:10:20,717 --> 00:10:23,151
<i>...that a very important person
at the New York Yankees...</i>

217
00:10:23,317 --> 00:10:24,545
<i>...needed this card back?</i>

218
00:10:24,717 --> 00:10:28,392
<i>Oh, no. I'd never part with this card
for anything in the world.</i>

219
00:10:28,557 --> 00:10:31,071
<i>Well, Bobby...</i>

220
00:10:32,197 --> 00:10:34,631
<i>- Who's your favourite Yankee?
- Paul O'Neill.</i>

221
00:10:34,797 --> 00:10:37,709
<i>What if I get Paul O'Neill
to hit a home run just for you?</i>

222
00:10:37,877 --> 00:10:41,074
<i>- Really? Paul O'Neill would do that?
- For you, he would.</i>

223
00:10:41,237 --> 00:10:42,909
<i>Could he hit two home runs?</i>

224
00:10:43,077 --> 00:10:44,510
Two?

225
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:47,555
<i>Sure, kid. But then you gotta promise
you'll do something for me.</i>

226
00:10:47,717 --> 00:10:50,675
<i>I know. Get out of this bed one day
and walk again.</i>

227
00:10:50,837 --> 00:10:53,226
<i>Yeah, that would be nice,
but I just need the card.</i>

228
00:10:57,877 --> 00:10:59,151
<i>What about this candelabra?</i>

229
00:10:59,317 --> 00:11:01,069
<i>That was Grandma Mema's also.</i>

230
00:11:01,237 --> 00:11:03,228
<i>She bought it on her trip to Europe
in 1926.</i>

231
00:11:03,957 --> 00:11:07,154
<i>Jerry, I'm thrilled you like my mutton.
I was afraid you only ate salad.</i>

232
00:11:07,317 --> 00:11:11,595
<i>Hey, salad's got nothing
on this mutton.</i>

233
00:11:12,477 --> 00:11:14,354
<i>That is so funny.
Did you just make that up?</i>

234
00:11:14,517 --> 00:11:16,109
<i>I wish I could take credit for it.</i>

235
00:11:16,277 --> 00:11:19,872
<i>It's actually a line my butcher uses
when we're chewing the fat.</i>

236
00:11:22,197 --> 00:11:24,028
<i>How about that beautiful desk
over there?</i>

237
00:11:26,357 --> 00:11:29,076
<i>Yeah, that was in Mema's study.</i>

238
00:11:29,237 --> 00:11:30,989
<i>I love that desk.</i>

239
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:33,387
<i>What did you do,
ransack the place after she died?</i>

240
00:11:33,557 --> 00:11:35,787
<i>This is some fine mutton.</i>

241
00:11:35,957 --> 00:11:37,868
<i>You know what?
I'm getting out of here.</i>

242
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:39,830
<i>Can I borrow your jacket?</i>

243
00:11:39,997 --> 00:11:42,227
<i>- Well, the thing is-
- It's cold out, okay?</i>

244
00:11:42,397 --> 00:11:44,115
<i>I didn't bring my own, okay? Jerry.</i>

245
00:11:44,277 --> 00:11:45,869
<i>Jerry!</i>

246
00:11:46,037 --> 00:11:47,948
<i>God forbid I should
borrow one from Holly.</i>

247
00:11:48,277 --> 00:11:50,347
<i>It might have belonged
to Grandma Mema.</i>

248
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,390
Thanks for mutton.

249
00:11:58,477 --> 00:12:00,672
<i>Nice doggy.</i>

250
00:12:00,837 --> 00:12:02,156
<i>I'm a nice person.</i>

251
00:12:02,317 --> 00:12:03,636
<i>Don't believe what you hear.</i>

252
00:12:03,797 --> 00:12:07,551
<i>I love dogs. I really do.</i>

253
00:12:08,357 --> 00:12:10,791
<i>- Where are the napkins?
- What?</i>

254
00:12:10,957 --> 00:12:14,029
<i>Grandma Mema's napkins.
Two are missing.</i>

255
00:12:15,237 --> 00:12:16,511
<i>Elaine took them, didn't she?</i>

256
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:18,948
I don't know about that.

257
00:12:19,117 --> 00:12:21,870
<i>- Have you got any floss?
- You heard her. She coveted them.</i>

258
00:12:22,037 --> 00:12:23,948
<i>I bet she took them just to spite me.</i>

259
00:12:24,117 --> 00:12:26,187
<i>She's probably having a laugh
about it right now.</i>

260
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:29,114
Down, doggy!

261
00:12:40,997 --> 00:12:42,715
<i>What are you doing
in this neighbourhood?</i>

262
00:12:42,877 --> 00:12:45,232
<i>- Did you hide the dogs?
- Yeah, they're in the kitchen.</i>

263
00:12:45,957 --> 00:12:49,552
<i>It's okay. Okay. Quiet!</i>

264
00:12:50,677 --> 00:12:51,951
- What's going on?
- Oh, God.

265
00:12:52,117 --> 00:12:53,345
<i>These dogs were chasing me.</i>

266
00:12:53,517 --> 00:12:54,666
<i>And no cabs were stopping.</i>

267
00:12:54,837 --> 00:12:57,305
<i>I had to get off the street.
I remembered you lived here.</i>

268
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:58,830
<i>Why were dogs chasing you?</i>

269
00:12:58,997 --> 00:13:01,192
<i>They just don't like me.
It's a long story.</i>

270
00:13:01,357 --> 00:13:03,712
<i>I can tell you about it someday,
but not right now.</i>

271
00:13:04,077 --> 00:13:07,752
<i>I would ask you to stay, but I only have
the sofa bed, and it's where I sleep.</i>

272
00:13:09,717 --> 00:13:11,628
<i>Well, we'll have to sleep
head-to-toe.</i>

273
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,027
<i>- Head-to-toe?
- Head-to-toe.</i>

274
00:13:35,597 --> 00:13:38,907
<i>Hey, wake up.</i>

275
00:13:40,437 --> 00:13:43,270
<i>It's 8:30. You were supposed
to wake me up at 7: 15.</i>

276
00:13:43,437 --> 00:13:47,112
<i>I'm sorry. I didn't get any sleep.
You kept kicking me in the face.</i>

277
00:13:47,277 --> 00:13:49,427
<i>You're a wake-up guy.
Don't you have calls to make?</i>

278
00:13:49,597 --> 00:13:51,747
<i>I'll make them later.</i>

279
00:13:58,917 --> 00:14:00,509
<i>- Have you seen Morgan?
- He's not here?</i>

280
00:14:00,677 --> 00:14:01,871
<i>No, he's late again.</i>

281
00:14:02,037 --> 00:14:03,993
<i>That's impossible.
I got him a wake-up service.</i>

282
00:14:04,157 --> 00:14:05,636
<i>You don't have to cover for him.</i>

283
00:14:05,797 --> 00:14:06,912
<i>He's gonna be gone soon...</i>

284
00:14:07,077 --> 00:14:09,511
<i>...and I'm gonna recommended you
for his job.</i>

285
00:14:09,677 --> 00:14:10,951
<i>Gone?</i>

286
00:14:11,477 --> 00:14:13,547
<i>Sounds like all that winking
got you a promotion.</i>

287
00:14:13,717 --> 00:14:16,277
<i>I don't want Morgan's job.
He's got a lot of work to do.</i>

288
00:14:16,437 --> 00:14:18,951
<i>Hey, Elaine, your friend
never woke up Mr. Morgan.</i>

289
00:14:19,117 --> 00:14:21,233
<i>Yeah, well, he was tired.
He had feet in his face.</i>

290
00:14:22,557 --> 00:14:25,071
<i>My cousin Holly
is completely insane.</i>

291
00:14:25,237 --> 00:14:28,434
<i>She keeps calling and accusing me
of stealing her napkins.</i>

292
00:14:28,597 --> 00:14:30,349
<i>- Napkins?
- I mean, why?</i>

293
00:14:30,517 --> 00:14:32,269
<i>Why would I take
her stupid napkins?</i>

294
00:14:32,437 --> 00:14:35,315
<i>Because they were in the pockets
of my jacket.</i>

295
00:14:35,477 --> 00:14:36,671
<i>- They were?
- Yes.</i>

296
00:14:36,837 --> 00:14:39,431
<i>I was using them
to spit out the mutton.</i>

297
00:14:40,117 --> 00:14:41,675
You spit it out?

298
00:14:41,837 --> 00:14:45,068
<i>I had dogs chasing me for that.</i>

299
00:14:45,797 --> 00:14:48,357
<i>I was almost mauled
because of that mutton.</i>

300
00:14:48,517 --> 00:14:50,235
<i>- What exactly is mutton?
- I don't know.</i>

301
00:14:50,397 --> 00:14:52,433
And I didn't wanna find out.

302
00:14:52,597 --> 00:14:54,030
<i>So where's my jacket?</i>

303
00:14:55,837 --> 00:14:57,236
<i>I must have left it at James'.</i>

304
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,627
<i>Spent the night at James', did we?</i>

305
00:14:59,797 --> 00:15:02,516
<i>Yeah, but we reversed positions,
so there was no funny business.</i>

306
00:15:03,157 --> 00:15:06,354
<i>- Reversed positions?
- Yeah, you know, head-to-toe.</i>

307
00:15:07,837 --> 00:15:11,307
<i>So what?
Your genitals are still lined up.</i>

308
00:15:13,597 --> 00:15:16,111
<i>No, because I slept
with my back to him.</i>

309
00:15:22,517 --> 00:15:23,745
<i>- Mr. O'Neill?
- Yeah.</i>

310
00:15:23,917 --> 00:15:25,669
<i>Yeah, look, you don't know me.</i>

311
00:15:25,837 --> 00:15:27,748
<i>All right. I can give you
an autograph here...</i>

312
00:15:27,917 --> 00:15:31,956
<i>...but my pen's kind of screwed up and
you'll probably only get, like, half a P.</i>

313
00:15:32,117 --> 00:15:34,312
<i>No, it's not that.
It's about a boy in the hospital.</i>

314
00:15:34,477 --> 00:15:37,196
<i>I was wondering if you could
do something to lift his spirits.</i>

315
00:15:37,357 --> 00:15:40,429
<i>- I can help you there.
- I promised you'd hit two home runs.</i>

316
00:15:40,597 --> 00:15:42,952
<i>- You what?
- Yeah, you know, a couple of dingers.</i>

317
00:15:43,117 --> 00:15:45,711
<i>You promised a kid in the hospital
I'd hit two home runs?</i>

318
00:15:45,877 --> 00:15:48,186
<i>- Yeah, what? No good?
- No, it's no good. It's terrible.</i>

319
00:15:48,357 --> 00:15:49,836
<i>You don't hit home runs like that.</i>

320
00:15:49,997 --> 00:15:52,352
<i>It's hard to hit home runs.
Where did you get two from?</i>

321
00:15:52,517 --> 00:15:54,348
<i>Well, two is better than one.</i>

322
00:15:54,517 --> 00:15:56,747
<i>That's ridiculous.
I'm not a home-run hitter.</i>

323
00:15:56,917 --> 00:15:58,987
<i>- Well, Babe Ruth did it.
- He did not.</i>

324
00:15:59,157 --> 00:16:00,909
<i>You're saying
that Babe Ruth was a liar?</i>

325
00:16:01,077 --> 00:16:04,194
<i>I'm not calling him a liar, but he wasn't
stupid enough to promise two.</i>

326
00:16:04,357 --> 00:16:06,507
<i>Well, maybe I did
overextend myself.</i>

327
00:16:06,677 --> 00:16:08,269
<i>How did you get in here anyway?</i>

328
00:16:11,077 --> 00:16:14,706
<i>Oh, hi, Elaine. You know, I lost
all of my 6:30 clients because of you.</i>

329
00:16:14,877 --> 00:16:18,028
<i>Yeah, well, why did you
have to stick your feet in my face?</i>

330
00:16:18,517 --> 00:16:21,236
<i>Yes, I have the jacket. Hold on.</i>

331
00:16:23,037 --> 00:16:24,436
<i>Fellas.</i>

332
00:16:25,077 --> 00:16:26,430
What do you got?

333
00:16:28,917 --> 00:16:32,114
<i>The Yank ees tak e the field
on a beautiful afternoon.</i>

334
00:16:32,277 --> 00:16:34,313
<i>It's hot in here.</i>

335
00:16:34,477 --> 00:16:37,071
<i>Hey, Bobby,
can I have some of your juice?</i>

336
00:16:37,637 --> 00:16:39,867
<i>After Paul O'Neill
hits his first home run.</i>

337
00:16:46,397 --> 00:16:47,796
<i>- Yeah?
- It's Holy.</i>

338
00:16:47,957 --> 00:16:52,428
<i>- Come on up.
- And the two-and-one pitch to O'Neil.</i>

339
00:16:52,597 --> 00:16:55,907
<i>Towering shot to deep right field,
and it's gone!</i>

340
00:16:56,117 --> 00:16:58,790
<i>- Yeah!
- A home run for Paul O'Neil.</i>

341
00:16:58,957 --> 00:17:02,393
<i>- The Yanks lead 1-nothing.
- Oh, yeah!</i>

342
00:17:02,557 --> 00:17:04,309
All right.

343
00:17:04,477 --> 00:17:05,705
<i>Yeah.</i>

344
00:17:06,237 --> 00:17:07,465
<i>One more to go.</i>

345
00:17:09,717 --> 00:17:11,594
<i>Hey, what's all this?</i>

346
00:17:11,757 --> 00:17:13,987
<i>I decided I'm gonna
make you dinner.</i>

347
00:17:14,157 --> 00:17:15,636
<i>Oh, I thought we were going out.</i>

348
00:17:15,797 --> 00:17:17,355
<i>After you scarfed up my mutton...</i>

349
00:17:17,517 --> 00:17:20,190
<i>...I had the irresistible urge
to make pork chops for you.</i>

350
00:17:21,877 --> 00:17:23,549
<i>Well, I said hello to Franco for you.</i>

351
00:17:24,517 --> 00:17:26,826
<i>- Franco?
- Your butcher down the street.</i>

352
00:17:29,197 --> 00:17:31,313
<i>I bet he acted all aloof
like he didn't know me.</i>

353
00:17:31,477 --> 00:17:35,072
<i>- A little.
- That is so Franco.</i>

354
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:38,834
<i>Bottom of the eighth.
Score tied at 1 apiece.</i>

355
00:17:38,997 --> 00:17:41,465
<i>Two and one to Paul O'Neil.</i>

356
00:17:41,637 --> 00:17:45,391
<i>Bobby, it's hard to hit two home runs
in one game, even for Paul O'Neill.</i>

357
00:17:45,557 --> 00:17:47,036
<i>He can do it, Mr. Kramer.</i>

358
00:17:47,197 --> 00:17:49,552
<i>I know he can. He'll do it for me.</i>

359
00:17:50,077 --> 00:17:55,629
<i>Long fly bal into deep left field,
and it drops just over Bele's head.</i>

360
00:17:55,797 --> 00:17:58,948
<i>O'Neil's rounding second,
the bal roling back to the wal.</i>

361
00:17:59,117 --> 00:18:01,028
<i>- O'Neil heading for third.
- Come on!</i>

362
00:18:01,197 --> 00:18:03,870
<i>O'Neil rounds third,
being waved in.</i>

363
00:18:04,037 --> 00:18:05,231
<i>Yeah! Go! Go!</i>

364
00:18:05,397 --> 00:18:08,833
<i>And Martinez throws it
over Alomar's head.</i>

365
00:18:08,997 --> 00:18:12,273
<i>O'Neil is safe at home,
the Yank ees tak e the lead.</i>

366
00:18:13,157 --> 00:18:14,954
<i>Inside-the-park home run!</i>

367
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:18,026
<i>- Yes, he did it.
- All right.</i>

368
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:19,789
<i>Yeah, well,
I guess I'll be on my way.</i>

369
00:18:19,957 --> 00:18:22,949
<i>Now, that's being scored
a triple for Paul O'Neil...</i>

370
00:18:23,117 --> 00:18:26,393
<i>...with a throwing error
charged to Martinez.</i>

371
00:18:26,557 --> 00:18:27,751
<i>Hey.</i>

372
00:18:27,917 --> 00:18:29,396
<i>That's not a home run.</i>

373
00:18:29,557 --> 00:18:31,036
<i>Well, maybe not technically, but-</i>

374
00:18:31,197 --> 00:18:32,994
<i>You said he would hit
two home runs.</i>

375
00:18:33,157 --> 00:18:35,625
<i>Come on, Bobby.
Bobby, that's just as good.</i>

376
00:18:35,797 --> 00:18:38,789
<i>- Well, you're not taking that card.
- Now, Bobby, Bobby. We had a deal.</i>

377
00:18:38,957 --> 00:18:41,232
<i>Come on, give me that.</i>

378
00:18:41,397 --> 00:18:43,957
<i>So is the chop
the way you like it?</i>

379
00:18:44,117 --> 00:18:46,187
<i>I usually like mine
with an angioplasty.</i>

380
00:18:54,357 --> 00:18:56,268
<i>Something really stinks to high-</i>

381
00:18:56,437 --> 00:18:58,348
Holly.

382
00:18:58,517 --> 00:18:59,711
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

383
00:18:59,877 --> 00:19:01,868
<i>What everyone does here.
Cooking pork chops.</i>

384
00:19:02,597 --> 00:19:04,667
<i>Listen, I'm meeting James here.</i>

385
00:19:04,837 --> 00:19:06,350
<i>He's bringing over your jacket.</i>

386
00:19:06,517 --> 00:19:08,314
<i>- And what about the napkins?
- Oh, God.</i>

387
00:19:08,477 --> 00:19:10,195
<i>I didn't take your napkins.</i>

388
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:12,552
<i>- Then who did?
- Ask Jerry.</i>

389
00:19:12,717 --> 00:19:14,992
<i>Hey, we can argue all night
over who took the napkins.</i>

390
00:19:15,157 --> 00:19:19,070
<i>The point is, in today's modern world,
it just doesn't seem relevant.</i>

391
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:22,671
<i>I still wanna know what happened
to that birthday card.</i>

392
00:19:22,837 --> 00:19:26,193
<i>- Now, Morgan, did you ever sign it?
- No, sir. George never gave it to me.</i>

393
00:19:26,357 --> 00:19:27,551
That's right. I didn't.

394
00:19:27,717 --> 00:19:30,311
<i>I take full responsibility
for the card not being here, I-</i>

395
00:19:30,477 --> 00:19:32,593
- I got it.
- What's this?

396
00:19:32,757 --> 00:19:35,715
<i>Oh, it's a birthday card. Yeah.</i>

397
00:19:36,557 --> 00:19:38,115
<i>George, by the way,
tomorrow night...</i>

398
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:40,871
<i>...Paul O'Neill has to catch
a fly ball in his hat.</i>

399
00:19:42,397 --> 00:19:44,865
<i>George, this is beautiful.</i>

400
00:19:45,037 --> 00:19:47,312
<i>Why didn't you tell me
you were gonna have it mounted?</i>

401
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:50,196
<i>Yeah, you were probably
just gonna stick it in an envelope.</i>

402
00:19:53,077 --> 00:19:55,796
<i>George, keep up the good work.</i>

403
00:19:57,317 --> 00:20:00,195
<i>Well, you screwed me again,
Costanza.</i>

404
00:20:00,357 --> 00:20:02,154
<i>How am I supposed
to sign the card now, huh?</i>

405
00:20:02,317 --> 00:20:03,636
<i>It's already under glass.</i>

406
00:20:06,837 --> 00:20:08,270
<i>Hi, James. Oh, this is-</i>

407
00:20:08,757 --> 00:20:11,317
<i>Excuse me.
What are those dogs wearing?</i>

408
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:13,786
<i>Oh, bandanas. Aren't they cute?</i>

409
00:20:13,957 --> 00:20:16,187
<i>You gave Mema's napkins
to some dogs?</i>

410
00:20:16,637 --> 00:20:18,036
<i>Hey, what happened to my jacket?</i>

411
00:20:18,197 --> 00:20:20,427
<i>Oh, the dogs did that,
but it wasn't their fault.</i>

412
00:20:20,597 --> 00:20:22,792
<i>Somebody stuffed
some strange meat in the pockets.</i>

413
00:20:22,957 --> 00:20:25,551
<i>- Was it mutton?
- Could have been.</i>

414
00:20:25,717 --> 00:20:27,708
<i>You always stuff
meat in your pockets?</i>

415
00:20:29,717 --> 00:20:32,106
<i>Sometimes I use the sofa.</i>

416
00:20:36,317 --> 00:20:37,636
<i>You wanted to see me?</i>

417
00:20:37,797 --> 00:20:39,594
<i>Yes, George.
Please, come in, come in.</i>

418
00:20:39,757 --> 00:20:42,032
<i>Thanks for the card. I loved it.
It made me feel good.</i>

419
00:20:42,197 --> 00:20:44,267
<i>Word has it you were
the brains behind the thing.</i>

420
00:20:44,437 --> 00:20:46,871
<i>No, no, not just me.
The whole organization.</i>

421
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,231
<i>Especially Mr. Morgan.</i>

422
00:20:48,397 --> 00:20:50,957
<i>Morgan, Morgan. You know,
his name is absent from this card.</i>

423
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:52,914
<i>Like he went out of his way
not to sign it.</i>

424
00:20:53,077 --> 00:20:54,749
Oh, no, Morgan is a good man, sir.

425
00:20:54,917 --> 00:20:57,067
<i>You can stop.
Congratulations, you've got his job.</i>

426
00:20:57,557 --> 00:21:00,594
<i>Well, thank you, sir. You know,
I'm not quite sure I'm right for it.</i>

427
00:21:00,757 --> 00:21:02,429
<i>It's done, George.
He's out, you're in.</i>

428
00:21:02,597 --> 00:21:03,950
<i>- It's a lot more work.
- I know.</i>

429
00:21:04,117 --> 00:21:05,550
<i>A lot more responsibility.</i>

430
00:21:05,717 --> 00:21:07,355
- Long, long hours.
- I know.

431
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:08,996
<i>Not much more money.</i>

432
00:21:09,157 --> 00:21:11,625
<i>But you'll finally
get the recognition you deserve.</i>

433
00:21:11,797 --> 00:21:13,025
That's what I'm afraid of.

434
00:21:13,197 --> 00:21:14,346
<i>You know, Mr. Steinbrenner-</i>

435
00:21:14,517 --> 00:21:17,748
<i>George, as painful as it is, I've had
to let a few people go over the years.</i>

436
00:21:17,917 --> 00:21:20,556
<i>Yogi Berra, Lou Piniella...</i>

437
00:21:20,717 --> 00:21:23,311
<i>...Bucky Dent, Billy Martin...</i>

438
00:21:23,477 --> 00:21:24,796
<i>...Dallas Green...</i>

439
00:21:24,957 --> 00:21:26,788
<i>...Dick Hauser, Bill Virdon...</i>

440
00:21:26,957 --> 00:21:28,470
...Billy Martin...

441
00:21:28,637 --> 00:21:30,787
<i>...Stump Merrill, Billy Martin...</i>

442
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:33,232
<i>...Bob Lemon, Billy Martin...</i>

443
00:21:33,397 --> 00:21:35,467
<i>...Gene Michael, Buck Showalter-</i>

444
00:21:35,637 --> 00:21:37,548
<i>George, you didn't hear that
from me.</i>

445
00:21:37,717 --> 00:21:39,355
<i>George!</i>
