1
00:00:02,567 --> 00:00:04,603
If wedding invitations
were left up to men...

2
00:00:04,767 --> 00:00:07,440
...we'd just drive around
sticking fliers in windshields.

3
00:00:08,847 --> 00:00:09,996
Not even typed up either.

4
00:00:10,167 --> 00:00:12,681
Just magic markers,
xeroxed, you know:

5
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:14,565
"Party."

6
00:00:16,847 --> 00:00:19,042
What's needed
is a divorce announcement.

7
00:00:19,207 --> 00:00:21,926
"Mr. And Mrs. Fred Johnson
request the honour of your presence...

8
00:00:22,087 --> 00:00:27,639
...at the returning of their daughter
back to Mr. And Mrs. Fred Johnson."

9
00:00:34,007 --> 00:00:35,759
- Hi.
- Hi, can I help you?

10
00:00:35,927 --> 00:00:39,442
- Yes, we'd like wedding invitations.
- Oh, well, congratulations.

11
00:00:39,607 --> 00:00:40,881
- Thank you.
- Yeah, thank you.

12
00:00:41,047 --> 00:00:42,241
- When's the wedding?
- June.

13
00:00:42,407 --> 00:00:47,037
- Late June.
- We have quite a few to pick from.

14
00:00:47,207 --> 00:00:50,563
They're arranged in order of price.
The most expensive are in the front.

15
00:00:56,727 --> 00:00:58,319
I don't know, what about this one?

16
00:00:59,247 --> 00:01:02,796
To tell you the truth, they haven't
made those for a number of years.

17
00:01:02,967 --> 00:01:05,322
I might have some boxes
in our warehouse in New Jersey.

18
00:01:05,487 --> 00:01:08,126
- I'd have to check.
- Oh, no. George, that's so ugly.

19
00:01:08,287 --> 00:01:09,640
We don't want that.

20
00:01:09,807 --> 00:01:12,879
What's the difference?
You just read it and mail it right back.

21
00:01:13,047 --> 00:01:15,242
- These ones.
- Why don't they make them anymore?

22
00:01:15,407 --> 00:01:19,195
Well, for one thing,
the glue isn't very adhesive.

23
00:01:19,367 --> 00:01:21,517
It takes a lot of moisture
to make them stick.

24
00:01:21,807 --> 00:01:24,082
So we pick up some Elmer's.

25
00:01:27,007 --> 00:01:28,520
All right.

26
00:01:28,727 --> 00:01:30,604
Do you see what I do for you?

27
00:01:32,487 --> 00:01:34,125
- Hey, Kramer.
- Hey, George.

28
00:01:34,847 --> 00:01:37,361
- Lilly.
- No, Susan.

29
00:01:37,527 --> 00:01:40,564
- No, no, it's Lilly.
- I think I know my own name.

30
00:01:40,727 --> 00:01:41,955
It's Susan.

31
00:01:42,767 --> 00:01:45,804
Well, you look like a Lilly.

32
00:01:49,687 --> 00:01:51,200
It's coming, Jerry, it's coming.

33
00:01:51,367 --> 00:01:54,006
- What's coming?
- The day.

34
00:01:54,167 --> 00:01:55,998
The day.

35
00:01:56,167 --> 00:01:58,806
We ordered
the wedding invitations today.

36
00:01:58,967 --> 00:02:01,606
Nothing can stop it now, nothing.

37
00:02:02,047 --> 00:02:04,402
It's here. It's happening.

38
00:02:04,567 --> 00:02:07,798
Can I do this? I can't do this.
Look at me. Look at me, I can't do this.

39
00:02:07,967 --> 00:02:09,923
I can't do it.
Help me, Jerry, help me.

40
00:02:10,087 --> 00:02:12,521
Just break it off with her.
Tell her it's over.

41
00:02:13,207 --> 00:02:14,481
I can't.

42
00:02:14,647 --> 00:02:16,399
- Why not?
- Because I can't face that scene.

43
00:02:16,567 --> 00:02:18,478
You know what kind of a scene
that would be?

44
00:02:18,647 --> 00:02:21,605
I'd rather be unhappy for the rest
of my life than to go through that.

45
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:25,521
I can't. I've tried to psych myself up
a million times. I can't go through that.

46
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,598
All right, take it easy.
Just take it easy.

47
00:02:29,767 --> 00:02:32,042
- What about a letter?
- A letter?

48
00:02:32,207 --> 00:02:34,163
I write a letter
and then I go to China.

49
00:02:35,607 --> 00:02:39,122
I disappear in a sea of people
for, like, six months, a year.

50
00:02:39,287 --> 00:02:41,960
You know,
just while things simmer down.

51
00:02:42,447 --> 00:02:45,519
"Dear Susan, I'm sorry.

52
00:02:45,767 --> 00:02:47,678
I made a terrible mistake.

53
00:02:47,847 --> 00:02:51,123
I'm really, really sorry."

54
00:02:52,087 --> 00:02:54,965
- That's it?
- What, too short?

55
00:02:55,127 --> 00:02:57,243
- Seems a little short, yeah.
- A little short.

56
00:02:57,527 --> 00:02:59,597
You can't go to China.
What about your job?

57
00:02:59,767 --> 00:03:02,122
Right. My job.

58
00:03:02,287 --> 00:03:04,596
So write a letter
and move to Staten Island.

59
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:07,759
It's easier to blend into a sea of people
in Staten Island than China.

60
00:03:08,607 --> 00:03:11,280
Yeah, yeah. Staten Island.

61
00:03:11,687 --> 00:03:14,963
- How do I get the rest of my clothes?
- You come back for your clothes.

62
00:03:15,127 --> 00:03:18,005
- I'm not going back in there.
- So forget about your clothes.

63
00:03:18,487 --> 00:03:21,763
Well, I'm not starting up
a whole new wardrobe now!

64
00:03:22,927 --> 00:03:26,078
Freedom and no clothes is a lot better
than no freedom with clothes.

65
00:03:26,567 --> 00:03:28,558
If she would just
take a plane somewhere.

66
00:03:28,727 --> 00:03:30,001
And what, hope for a crash?

67
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:32,242
It happens.

68
00:03:32,407 --> 00:03:34,762
Do you know the odds on a crash?
It's a million to one.

69
00:03:35,287 --> 00:03:39,041
It's something. It's hope.

70
00:03:40,407 --> 00:03:41,726
- Hey. Hey!
- Hey.

71
00:03:41,887 --> 00:03:43,764
Georgie, you know
what I just realized?

72
00:03:44,087 --> 00:03:47,204
The wedding is like a month away.

73
00:03:47,767 --> 00:03:49,200
- Elaine.
- What?

74
00:03:49,367 --> 00:03:52,325
Oh, by the way, what am I gonna
get to be in the wedding party?

75
00:03:53,047 --> 00:03:55,117
- What do you mean?
- Jerry's gonna be best man...

76
00:03:55,287 --> 00:03:57,357
...and Kramer's the usher.
What am I gonna be?

77
00:03:57,607 --> 00:03:59,120
I don't think you're anything.

78
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:03,599
Well, I have to be something.
I'm a close friend.

79
00:04:03,967 --> 00:04:06,800
- What about being a bridesmaid?
- Well, those are Susan's friends.

80
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:12,405
- Then how about being an usher?
- All right, I'll ask Susan about it later.

81
00:04:12,567 --> 00:04:15,923
You don't ask. You tell.

82
00:04:19,007 --> 00:04:20,998
What about the letter?
Should I think about it?

83
00:04:21,167 --> 00:04:23,397
Elaine, if a guy wanted
to end a relationship...

84
00:04:23,567 --> 00:04:24,636
...what could he do?

85
00:04:25,927 --> 00:04:27,599
Start smoking.

86
00:04:28,207 --> 00:04:29,959
Smoking.

87
00:04:30,127 --> 00:04:32,402
- Does she hate cigarettes?
- Yes, she hates cigarettes.

88
00:04:32,967 --> 00:04:34,639
But you don't smoke.

89
00:04:35,247 --> 00:04:37,124
No.

90
00:04:39,127 --> 00:04:41,846
You know, I think I'm getting
depressed about George's wedding.

91
00:04:42,007 --> 00:04:44,567
- Really?
- Yeah, once he gets married, that's it.

92
00:04:44,727 --> 00:04:47,195
She'll probably get pregnant.
They'll move to Westchester.

93
00:04:47,367 --> 00:04:50,165
- I'll never see him again.
- Yeah, you're probably right.

94
00:04:50,327 --> 00:04:53,000
- Then it'll be just me, you and Kramer.
- No, not me, pal.

95
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,635
I can't keep this up much longer.
I'm sick of being single.

96
00:04:55,807 --> 00:04:58,275
- I'm getting out.
- So it's just gonna be me and Kramer?

97
00:04:58,447 --> 00:05:00,563
Yeah, just you and Kramer.

98
00:05:00,727 --> 00:05:02,126
See you.

99
00:05:03,047 --> 00:05:04,958
Me and Kramer.

100
00:05:06,087 --> 00:05:08,362
Hey, buddy.

101
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:11,998
Hey, I thought of
a great invention for driving.

102
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:15,125
A periscope in a car,
so you can see traffic.

103
00:05:15,287 --> 00:05:16,561
How are you gonna drive...

104
00:05:16,727 --> 00:05:19,036
...while you're
looking through a periscope?

105
00:05:19,207 --> 00:05:20,845
Besides which, it's not a submarine.

106
00:05:21,007 --> 00:05:22,963
There's no room for a periscope
on a car.

107
00:05:23,127 --> 00:05:25,846
- Oh, you make a higher roof.
- They're not making higher roofs.

108
00:05:26,127 --> 00:05:27,765
Well, why can't you
make a higher roof?

109
00:05:28,487 --> 00:05:30,318
Because it's a stupid idea.

110
00:05:30,487 --> 00:05:33,638
No one's gonna go for it.
Don't you understand? It's stupid!

111
00:05:35,447 --> 00:05:37,005
Stupid. It's stupid.

112
00:05:38,487 --> 00:05:39,840
Hey, hey, hey, look out!

113
00:05:40,887 --> 00:05:42,923
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

114
00:05:43,087 --> 00:05:45,681
Yeah, thanks.

115
00:05:45,847 --> 00:05:47,724
Oh, my God. You saved my life.

116
00:05:47,887 --> 00:05:50,606
Shouldn't there be
some kind of reward for that?

117
00:05:51,647 --> 00:05:53,399
You should be careful
crossing the street.

118
00:05:53,567 --> 00:05:55,683
Otherwise you could die,
if that bothers you.

119
00:05:56,487 --> 00:05:59,604
- Well, yeah...
- See? To me, this is a waste.

120
00:06:00,007 --> 00:06:01,838
- What?
- The shirt under your sweater.

121
00:06:02,007 --> 00:06:03,759
It sits in a drawer for three weeks...

122
00:06:03,927 --> 00:06:07,078
...and when it finally comes out,
it only sticks up out of your collar.

123
00:06:07,447 --> 00:06:09,438
- I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
- Jeannie Steinman.

124
00:06:09,847 --> 00:06:13,362
- Same initials. How do you like that?
- I like it.

125
00:06:14,487 --> 00:06:17,797
Listen, I was talking to Elaine today,
and she said...

126
00:06:17,967 --> 00:06:20,527
...that she would really like
to be an usher at the wedding.

127
00:06:21,367 --> 00:06:23,198
No, out of the question.

128
00:06:23,367 --> 00:06:25,358
I don't want any women ushers
at my wedding.

129
00:06:25,527 --> 00:06:28,758
And while we're on the subject,
Kramer's not an usher either.

130
00:06:28,927 --> 00:06:31,395
- Why not?
- He doesn't even know my name.

131
00:06:31,887 --> 00:06:34,401
- That was an honest mistake.
- No, he's too weird.

132
00:06:34,567 --> 00:06:37,001
He'd fall or something.
He'd ruin the whole ceremony.

133
00:06:38,487 --> 00:06:40,557
Yeah, you're probably right.

134
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:45,639
What are you doing?

135
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:49,686
Since when do you smoke?

136
00:06:51,287 --> 00:06:53,198
I've always smoked.

137
00:06:53,887 --> 00:06:58,039
- I've never seen you smoke.
- Oh, yeah, well, big smoker.

138
00:06:58,327 --> 00:07:01,000
I gave it up for a while,
but it was too tough.

139
00:07:01,167 --> 00:07:04,682
You know, I don't got the willpower.

140
00:07:04,927 --> 00:07:09,398
- Oh, I don't like this one bit.
- Well, I can't stop now.

141
00:07:11,887 --> 00:07:14,606
I'm addicted.
They've gotten a hold on me.

142
00:07:15,127 --> 00:07:16,879
Well, you are gonna have to quit.

143
00:07:22,847 --> 00:07:24,405
- Menus?
- No, I know what I want.

144
00:07:24,567 --> 00:07:25,795
- The usual?
- Yeah.

145
00:07:25,967 --> 00:07:28,401
- And for you?
- A bowl of Cheerios, not too much milk.

146
00:07:28,567 --> 00:07:30,159
Okay, two bowls of Cheerios.

147
00:07:33,527 --> 00:07:34,880
- You too?
- Yeah.

148
00:07:37,247 --> 00:07:39,920
Hey, did you hear
the bank on the corner...

149
00:07:40,087 --> 00:07:43,762
...is offering $100 if you go in there
and they don't greet you with a "hello."

150
00:07:44,247 --> 00:07:45,646
Oh, really? That's nice.

151
00:07:46,847 --> 00:07:49,315
- Come on. What's with you?
- I think I'm in love.

152
00:07:50,367 --> 00:07:52,244
Oh, come on.

153
00:07:52,527 --> 00:07:54,882
No, it's true.
This woman saved my life.

154
00:07:55,047 --> 00:07:57,277
I was crossing the street.
I was almost hit by a car.

155
00:07:57,447 --> 00:07:58,641
And then we talked...

156
00:07:58,807 --> 00:08:01,162
...and the whole thing
just seemed like a dream.

157
00:08:01,327 --> 00:08:04,558
If a guy saved your life,
you'd be in love with him too.

158
00:08:05,447 --> 00:08:07,438
No, this woman is different.
She's incredible.

159
00:08:07,927 --> 00:08:10,839
She's just like me.
She talks like me. She acts like me.

160
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:14,556
She ordered cereal in a restaurant.
We even have the same initials.

161
00:08:15,767 --> 00:08:18,076
- Wait, I just realized what's going on.
- What?

162
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:20,920
Now I know what I've been
looking for all these years.

163
00:08:21,087 --> 00:08:22,679
Myself.

164
00:08:25,167 --> 00:08:28,318
I've been waiting
for me to come along.

165
00:08:28,487 --> 00:08:31,445
And now I've swept myself
off my feet.

166
00:08:33,287 --> 00:08:36,563
Will you stop it, man?
You're freaking me out.

167
00:08:36,727 --> 00:08:38,445
Jeez.

168
00:08:43,207 --> 00:08:44,401
- Hey.
- Hey.

169
00:08:44,727 --> 00:08:47,719
- Wait a second, you didn't say "hello."
- Yes, I did.

170
00:08:47,887 --> 00:08:50,162
No. No, you didn't.
Hundred dollars. I get $100.

171
00:08:50,327 --> 00:08:52,682
- No, no, I said "hello."
- No, no, you said "hey."

172
00:08:52,847 --> 00:08:54,997
Well, "hey" is "hello." Same thing.

173
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:58,239
The ad said the bank will pay $100
if you're not greeted with a "hello."

174
00:08:58,407 --> 00:09:00,557
You're taking that much too literally.

175
00:09:00,727 --> 00:09:02,683
Now, sir, do you have
any business to transact?

176
00:09:02,847 --> 00:09:05,156
- I wanna speak with the manager.
- He's not here.

177
00:09:05,647 --> 00:09:07,285
Then I'll be back.

178
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:10,158
- So I'm not gonna be an usher?
- No.

179
00:09:10,487 --> 00:09:11,920
So I'm nothing?

180
00:09:12,087 --> 00:09:16,046
Jerry is best man,
Kramer is an usher, and I am nothing?

181
00:09:16,367 --> 00:09:18,961
- Kramer's not an usher anymore.
- What are you talking about?

182
00:09:19,127 --> 00:09:20,879
- You've been demoted.
- Why?

183
00:09:21,047 --> 00:09:23,038
Because you called her
by the wrong name.

184
00:09:23,767 --> 00:09:26,076
But she really looks like a Lilly.

185
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:30,642
Jerry. Hey, Jerry, Susan says
I can't be an usher at the wedding.

186
00:09:30,807 --> 00:09:32,240
Yeah, me neither.

187
00:09:32,407 --> 00:09:34,557
George, I wanna bring a date
to the wedding.

188
00:09:34,727 --> 00:09:36,797
- Who?
- I just met her. She's incredible.

189
00:09:36,967 --> 00:09:39,765
Oh, this is great!

190
00:09:39,927 --> 00:09:44,045
Now I'm gonna be stuck
at the singles' table with all the losers?

191
00:09:45,287 --> 00:09:47,801
- You can go with Kramer.
- No, no, no.

192
00:09:47,967 --> 00:09:50,401
Weddings are a great place
to meet chicks.

193
00:09:50,567 --> 00:09:52,876
I have to be unfettered.

194
00:09:53,847 --> 00:09:55,803
Do you see
what this is turning into?

195
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,765
Do I need this?
I have got to get out of this thing.

196
00:09:58,927 --> 00:10:01,964
- Did you try the cigarettes?
- Yeah, they made me sick.

197
00:10:02,127 --> 00:10:05,199
All right, all right.
Let's get down here.

198
00:10:06,847 --> 00:10:08,565
You really wanna get out
of this thing?

199
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,559
- Yeah.
- All right. I got two words for you:

200
00:10:12,727 --> 00:10:14,638
Prenup.

201
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:16,566
Prenup, what does that mean?

202
00:10:16,727 --> 00:10:21,005
- Ask her to sign a prenup.
- What does that do?

203
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:23,283
Because most women,
when asked to sign a prenup...

204
00:10:23,447 --> 00:10:25,961
...are so offended,
they back out of the marriage.

205
00:10:27,007 --> 00:10:28,565
They are?

206
00:10:29,167 --> 00:10:31,886
- Elaine?
- I wouldn't sign one.

207
00:10:34,127 --> 00:10:37,358
Prenup, of course.

208
00:10:38,327 --> 00:10:41,046
- Kramer.
- Get out of here.

209
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:47,006
- Hi.
- Hi.

210
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,806
Hey, I've been going over the list.
Wanna invite The Drake?

211
00:10:49,967 --> 00:10:52,356
Oh, got to invite The Drake.

212
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:53,960
Listen.

213
00:10:54,367 --> 00:10:56,198
There's something
that's been on my mind...

214
00:10:56,367 --> 00:11:00,155
...and we haven't really talked about it
and it's kind of important to me.

215
00:11:00,647 --> 00:11:01,841
What is it?

216
00:11:02,007 --> 00:11:04,680
Well, I've put a lot of thought
into this...

217
00:11:04,847 --> 00:11:08,522
...and I think that I would like you
to sign a prenuptial agreement.

218
00:11:09,567 --> 00:11:11,842
- A prenup?
- Yeah.

219
00:11:16,127 --> 00:11:17,924
What's so funny?

220
00:11:18,807 --> 00:11:22,004
You don't have any money.
I make more money than you do.

221
00:11:25,967 --> 00:11:28,925
Yeah, give me the papers,
I'll sign them.

222
00:11:30,927 --> 00:11:32,280
A prenup.

223
00:11:57,167 --> 00:11:58,964
Excuse me.

224
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:04,805
Jerry.

225
00:12:06,007 --> 00:12:07,679
- Hey, Jeannie.
- Hello.

226
00:12:07,847 --> 00:12:09,803
- Remember I told you about the bank?
- Yeah.

227
00:12:09,967 --> 00:12:13,039
Well, I went in there
and they said, "hey."

228
00:12:13,807 --> 00:12:15,559
"Hey" is the same as "hello."
What do you think?

229
00:12:15,727 --> 00:12:17,558
Yeah, I think it's the same thing.

230
00:12:18,127 --> 00:12:20,687
Oh, big surprise.

231
00:12:27,087 --> 00:12:30,159
- Delivery from Melody Stationers.
- Oh, those are the invitations.

232
00:12:30,327 --> 00:12:32,204
- Just sign here.
- Yeah.

233
00:12:33,287 --> 00:12:34,720
Thank you.

234
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:36,924
- See you later.
- Oh, these are so cheap.

235
00:12:37,087 --> 00:12:39,203
Don't forget tomorrow.
We're shopping for rings...

236
00:12:39,367 --> 00:12:43,076
...so don't make any plans.
And this time we're not skimping.

237
00:12:44,407 --> 00:12:45,886
- Hey.
- Hey.

238
00:12:46,047 --> 00:12:47,924
- Jeannie left?
- Yeah, she's coming to see...

239
00:12:48,087 --> 00:12:50,601
...my act tonight.
- Oh, yeah? Well, that's nice.

240
00:12:50,767 --> 00:12:53,361
I'm sure that's right up her alley.

241
00:12:53,527 --> 00:12:54,926
- What's with you?
- Nothing.

242
00:12:55,087 --> 00:12:56,236
- Something on your mind?
- No.

243
00:12:56,407 --> 00:12:57,635
- Looks like there is.
- No.

244
00:12:57,807 --> 00:13:00,321
Come on, something's
on your mind. Out with it.

245
00:13:00,527 --> 00:13:02,597
I don't like her!

246
00:13:02,887 --> 00:13:04,479
- You don't like her?
- That's right.

247
00:13:04,647 --> 00:13:07,684
I don't like her.
I never liked her from the get- go.

248
00:13:08,167 --> 00:13:10,635
- What's wrong with her?
- Everything she thinks, you think.

249
00:13:10,807 --> 00:13:13,116
Everything you think, she thinks.
No, I can't take it.

250
00:13:13,287 --> 00:13:16,518
I can't take it, Jerry.
It's too much. It's too much.

251
00:13:16,687 --> 00:13:18,803
If you can't take her,
maybe you can't take me.

252
00:13:19,087 --> 00:13:21,965
- So that's how it's gonna be?
- That's how it's gonna be.

253
00:13:22,127 --> 00:13:25,005
Oh, God help us!

254
00:13:33,007 --> 00:13:34,486
Awful.

255
00:14:17,407 --> 00:14:19,762
- Can I help you?
- Yeah.

256
00:14:21,087 --> 00:14:23,760
I was in here the other day,
and I went up to that teller...

257
00:14:23,927 --> 00:14:25,360
...and he didn't say "hello."

258
00:14:26,127 --> 00:14:28,960
Well, then you are entitled to $100.
That's our policy.

259
00:14:29,127 --> 00:14:31,118
Yeah, but he wouldn't
give me the money.

260
00:14:31,447 --> 00:14:33,199
Jim, can I see you for a second?

261
00:14:33,767 --> 00:14:37,680
- Yes, can you give me a minute?
- Yeah.

262
00:14:37,847 --> 00:14:40,884
He'll be right over.

263
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,035
What is this, oak?

264
00:14:55,087 --> 00:14:58,238
- I think it's pine.
- Pine is good.

265
00:14:58,567 --> 00:15:00,558
Yeah, pine's okay.

266
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:05,681
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

267
00:15:05,847 --> 00:15:08,680
Jim, the man here
says he came in the other day...

268
00:15:08,847 --> 00:15:11,156
...you didn't say "hello."
- No, that's not true.

269
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:14,239
I said "hey." You know,
like a friendly greeting, "hey."

270
00:15:14,407 --> 00:15:17,046
- Yeah, but that's not "hello."
- That's a tough one.

271
00:15:18,687 --> 00:15:20,518
Let me bring
some other people in on this.

272
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:24,885
Barbara, Jane, Mike,
can I see you, please?

273
00:15:27,567 --> 00:15:29,046
- How you doing?
- What's happening?

274
00:15:29,207 --> 00:15:30,686
What's up?

275
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:35,157
Can you excuse us
for just one minute? Just one minute.

276
00:15:36,007 --> 00:15:37,486
Thanks.

277
00:15:41,847 --> 00:15:43,519
How's it going?

278
00:15:44,767 --> 00:15:46,644
Thanks. Thanks, everybody.

279
00:15:48,567 --> 00:15:51,320
Sir, have a seat.

280
00:15:54,527 --> 00:15:58,315
Well, we've discussed this.
Here's the feeling.

281
00:15:58,567 --> 00:16:01,206
You got a greeting. It starts with an H.
How's 20 bucks sound?

282
00:16:01,367 --> 00:16:02,880
- I'll take it.
- All right, sir.

283
00:16:19,647 --> 00:16:21,683
Will you marry me?

284
00:16:36,007 --> 00:16:39,079
I would like to propose a toast...
Wait a second!

285
00:16:39,247 --> 00:16:41,681
George! George Costanza,
come in here!

286
00:16:41,847 --> 00:16:43,485
- Georgie boy.
- George, big news.

287
00:16:43,647 --> 00:16:45,603
- I'm getting married.
- Married? What?

288
00:16:45,767 --> 00:16:49,476
September 21 st, first day of autumn.
Leaves changing, beautiful colours.

289
00:16:49,647 --> 00:16:50,875
- All that crap.
- You see?

290
00:16:51,047 --> 00:16:53,356
- I kept up my end of the pact.
- Oh, good for you.

291
00:16:53,527 --> 00:16:55,358
- And look, champagne.
- Hey.

292
00:16:55,527 --> 00:16:57,995
- To our future wives.
- Oh, yeah.

293
00:16:58,167 --> 00:16:59,725
Yeah.

294
00:17:12,167 --> 00:17:14,886
This has been quite a night.
I could sure use a cup of coffee.

295
00:17:15,047 --> 00:17:17,561
Hey, what's the deal with decaf?

296
00:17:17,727 --> 00:17:19,479
How do they get the caffeine
out of there?

297
00:17:19,647 --> 00:17:22,480
- And then where does it go?
- I don't know.

298
00:17:25,807 --> 00:17:27,365
That's a shame.

299
00:17:28,807 --> 00:17:31,116
- I'll just have a cup of coffee.
- Bowl of corn flakes.

300
00:17:32,527 --> 00:17:34,404
More cereal?
That's your third bowl today.

301
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:38,037
- You had it for breakfast and lunch.
- Hey. So, what's the deal with brunch?

302
00:17:38,207 --> 00:17:40,198
If it's a combination
of breakfast and lunch...

303
00:17:40,367 --> 00:17:43,200
...how come there's no "lupper,"
or no "linner"?

304
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:49,646
Hey!

305
00:17:50,007 --> 00:17:52,567
Frank just called me.
Congratulations.

306
00:17:52,727 --> 00:17:55,924
- Thanks. Thanks.
- Look, I'm sorry about before.

307
00:17:56,087 --> 00:17:59,204
- I'm sure I'll learn to like her, Jerry.
- Yeah, yeah.

308
00:17:59,367 --> 00:18:02,040
Come on, come on.
What's the matter?

309
00:18:03,287 --> 00:18:05,357
I think I may have
made a big mistake.

310
00:18:06,807 --> 00:18:09,275
- Oh, come on.
- No, all of a sudden it hit me.

311
00:18:09,447 --> 00:18:10,926
I realized what the problem is.

312
00:18:11,087 --> 00:18:13,043
I can't be with someone like me.

313
00:18:13,207 --> 00:18:15,198
I hate myself!

314
00:18:15,567 --> 00:18:17,876
I need to be with someone
the complete opposite of me.

315
00:18:18,047 --> 00:18:20,959
It's too much, Kramer.
I can't take it! I can't take it!

316
00:18:22,407 --> 00:18:25,160
It's too bad you got engaged.

317
00:18:25,727 --> 00:18:27,604
Yeah, too bad.

318
00:18:29,087 --> 00:18:30,964
Hello? Oh, hey, George.

319
00:18:31,127 --> 00:18:34,039
What? Really?

320
00:18:34,207 --> 00:18:36,402
I'll call Elaine.
We'll meet you down there.

321
00:18:36,567 --> 00:18:38,797
- What happened?
- They took Susan to the hospital.

322
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:42,642
- So she was just lying there?
- Yeah.

323
00:18:42,807 --> 00:18:44,559
- I wonder what happened.
- I don't know.

324
00:18:44,727 --> 00:18:46,797
There's the doctor.

325
00:18:47,887 --> 00:18:49,525
Excuse me, are you the husband?

326
00:18:50,207 --> 00:18:56,362
- Well, not yet. Fiancé.
- Yes. Well, I'm sorry.

327
00:18:56,527 --> 00:18:58,165
She's gone.

328
00:19:00,847 --> 00:19:02,326
What's that?

329
00:19:04,087 --> 00:19:05,361
She expired.

330
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,399
Are you sure?

331
00:19:12,047 --> 00:19:13,366
Yes, of course.

332
00:19:13,927 --> 00:19:16,122
So...

333
00:19:16,287 --> 00:19:17,515
...she's dead?

334
00:19:19,927 --> 00:19:21,201
Yes.

335
00:19:26,007 --> 00:19:27,326
Let me ask you...

336
00:19:27,487 --> 00:19:32,925
...had she been exposed
to any kind of inexpensive glue?

337
00:19:35,567 --> 00:19:37,523
- Why?
- We found traces...

338
00:19:37,687 --> 00:19:40,326
...of a certain toxic adhesive...

339
00:19:40,487 --> 00:19:44,321
...commonly found
in very low-priced envelopes.

340
00:19:45,447 --> 00:19:48,041
Well, she was sending out
our wedding invitations.

341
00:19:48,967 --> 00:19:51,401
That's probably what did it.

342
00:19:52,247 --> 00:19:54,966
We were expecting
about 200 people.

343
00:19:57,367 --> 00:20:01,599
Well, thank you, doctor.

344
00:20:18,247 --> 00:20:20,124
She's...

345
00:20:21,047 --> 00:20:22,480
...gone.

346
00:20:23,927 --> 00:20:25,440
Dead?

347
00:20:26,727 --> 00:20:31,482
I'm so sorry, George.

348
00:20:32,407 --> 00:20:34,284
Yeah, me too.

349
00:20:37,047 --> 00:20:38,196
Poor Lilly.

350
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:40,198
- Susan.
- Susan.

351
00:20:45,367 --> 00:20:47,835
- How did it happen?
- Apparently the glue...

352
00:20:48,007 --> 00:20:51,124
...in the wedding invitations was...

353
00:20:52,327 --> 00:20:53,965
...toxic.

354
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,719
Well, that's weird.

355
00:21:00,327 --> 00:21:02,204
So I guess...

356
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:05,919
...you're not getting married.
- Yeah.

357
00:21:07,727 --> 00:21:09,160
But...

358
00:21:10,807 --> 00:21:14,595
- Yeah?
- Well, now I'm engaged.

359
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:16,201
Yeah?

360
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:18,478
Well, I thought
we'd both be getting married.

361
00:21:19,527 --> 00:21:21,995
Hey, what can I tell you?

362
00:21:22,287 --> 00:21:23,436
All right.

363
00:21:25,047 --> 00:21:26,958
Well, let's get some coffee.

364
00:21:28,167 --> 00:21:30,476
We had a pact!

365
00:21:37,807 --> 00:21:41,117
Yes, I'd like to speak
with Marisa Tomei, please.

366
00:21:42,767 --> 00:21:46,760
Marisa, hi. It's George Costanza.

367
00:21:46,967 --> 00:21:51,358
I'm the short, funny, quirky
bald man you met a little while ago.

368
00:21:51,527 --> 00:21:53,882
Yeah, I was just calling
because I wanted you to know...

369
00:21:54,047 --> 00:21:57,198
...that I'm not engaged anymore.

370
00:21:57,727 --> 00:22:00,002
Well, she died.

371
00:22:00,767 --> 00:22:03,884
Toxic glue
from the wedding invitations.

372
00:22:04,567 --> 00:22:07,286
Well, we were expecting
about 200 people.

373
00:22:07,647 --> 00:22:12,402
Yeah. Anyway,
I've got the funeral tomorrow...

374
00:22:13,927 --> 00:22:16,395
...but my weekend
is pretty wide open...

375
00:22:17,207 --> 00:22:20,404
...and, you know,
I was wondering... Hello?

376
00:22:20,567 --> 00:22:22,159
Hello?
