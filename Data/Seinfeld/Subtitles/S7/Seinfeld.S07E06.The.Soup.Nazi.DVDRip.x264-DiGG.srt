1
00:01:02,207 --> 00:01:03,401
Yes, I'm a very lazy eater.</i>

2
00:01:04,767 --> 00:01:08,077
That's why I like soup.
First of all, it looks half-digested...</i>

3
00:01:08,247 --> 00:01:10,602
...so you feel like half the work
is done already.</i>

4
00:01:10,767 --> 00:01:13,235
I'm hoping Campbell's comes out
with an IV line of soup...</i>

5
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,921
...that you could just jam
right into your arm, you know?

6
00:01:16,087 --> 00:01:18,362
Campbell's tomato intravenous.</i>

7
00:01:18,527 --> 00:01:20,279
Mainline gumbo.</i>

8
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:23,007
Everyone just sitting around
at dinner with their soup IV...</i>

9
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:25,397
...hanging on the hook there,
you know?</i>

10
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:29,603
How's yours, Grandpa?

11
00:01:29,767 --> 00:01:31,962
Oh, chunky style.</i>

12
00:01:37,167 --> 00:01:38,964
What theatre do you wanna
go to tonight?</i>

13
00:01:39,127 --> 00:01:42,597
We got 61 st and 3rd
or 84th and Broadway.</i>

14
00:01:42,967 --> 00:01:44,559
Which one you wanna go to,
Schmoopie?</i>

15
00:01:44,727 --> 00:01:46,524
You called me "Schmoopie."
You're Schmoopie.</i>

16
00:01:46,687 --> 00:01:48,200
- You're Schmoopie.
- You're Schmoopie.</i>

17
00:01:48,367 --> 00:01:50,597
You're Schmoopie.</i>

18
00:01:50,767 --> 00:01:53,759
All right, Schmoopies,
what's it gonna be?</i>

19
00:01:53,927 --> 00:01:56,043
- Pick a theatre.
- We'll go to 3rd Avenue.</i>

20
00:01:56,367 --> 00:01:58,119
So can you come with us
to the soup place?</i>

21
00:01:58,287 --> 00:02:01,359
No, you have a good lunch.
I'll meet you here for the movie.</i>

22
00:02:01,727 --> 00:02:02,716
- Hey.
- Hey.</i>

23
00:02:02,887 --> 00:02:04,445
- Hi, Elaine.
- Hi, Sheila.</i>

24
00:02:04,607 --> 00:02:06,996
All right, then I'll see you later.</i>

25
00:02:07,167 --> 00:02:09,078
- Bye, Schmoopie.
- Bye, Schmoopie.</i>

26
00:02:12,527 --> 00:02:14,040
Okay, we ready to go?</i>

27
00:02:14,207 --> 00:02:16,357
Yes, please. Please, let's go.</i>

28
00:02:16,527 --> 00:02:18,119
I'm in the mood for a cheeseburger.</i>

29
00:02:18,287 --> 00:02:20,517
- No, we gotta go to the soup place.
- What soup place?</i>

30
00:02:20,687 --> 00:02:22,757
There's a soup stand.
Kramer's been going there.</i>

31
00:02:22,927 --> 00:02:23,916
He's always raving.</i>

32
00:02:24,087 --> 00:02:26,396
I finally got a chance to go,
and I tell you this:</i>

33
00:02:26,567 --> 00:02:27,886
You will be stunned.</i>

34
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:29,321
Stunned by soup?</i>

35
00:02:29,487 --> 00:02:32,524
You can't eat this soup standing up.
Your knees buckle.</i>

36
00:02:32,687 --> 00:02:34,166
All right, let's go. Come on.</i>

37
00:02:34,327 --> 00:02:35,919
There's only one caveat.</i>

38
00:02:36,087 --> 00:02:38,396
Guy who runs the place
is a little temperamental.</i>

39
00:02:38,567 --> 00:02:40,876
Especially about
the ordering procedure.</i>

40
00:02:41,047 --> 00:02:44,119
He's secretly referred to
as the "Soup Nazi."</i>

41
00:02:44,447 --> 00:02:46,165
What happens
if you don't order right?</i>

42
00:02:46,327 --> 00:02:48,887
- He yells, and you don't get your soup.
- What?</i>

43
00:02:49,047 --> 00:02:51,242
Just follow the procedure
and you will be fine.</i>

44
00:02:51,407 --> 00:02:53,443
- All right, let's go over that again.
- All right.</i>

45
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:57,839
As you walk in the place,
move immediately to your right.</i>

46
00:02:58,007 --> 00:03:00,282
Okay, the main thing
is to keep the line moving.</i>

47
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:03,007
You hold out your money,
speak your soup in a clear voice...</i>

48
00:03:03,167 --> 00:03:05,123
- ... step to the left, and receive soup.
- Right.</i>

49
00:03:05,287 --> 00:03:07,323
It's very important not
to embellish your order.</i>

50
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:10,638
No extraneous comments,
no questions, no compliments.</i>

51
00:03:10,807 --> 00:03:13,401
- Oh, boy, I'm really scared.
- Elaine.</i>

52
00:03:13,567 --> 00:03:15,762
Jerry, that's enough now
about the Soup Nazi.</i>

53
00:03:17,967 --> 00:03:19,241
Look at this.

54
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:22,638
You know what this is?
This is an antique armoire.</i>

55
00:03:24,127 --> 00:03:26,322
It's French, armoire.</i>

56
00:03:26,487 --> 00:03:28,125
Armoire.</i>

57
00:03:28,287 --> 00:03:30,039
- How much is this?
- I was asking 250.

58
00:03:30,207 --> 00:03:32,357
But you got a nice face.
Two even.</i>

59
00:03:34,607 --> 00:03:37,644
Two hundred. You know, I've always
wanted one of these things.</i>

60
00:03:37,807 --> 00:03:41,436
- He gave you the nice-face discount.
- Yeah. All right, you guys go ahead.</i>

61
00:03:41,607 --> 00:03:44,679
- What about the soup?
- I'm getting an armoire, Jerry.</i>

62
00:03:44,847 --> 00:03:46,519
Pardon.

63
00:03:47,767 --> 00:03:48,961
This line is huge.</i>

64
00:03:49,127 --> 00:03:50,606
And it's like this all the time.</i>

65
00:03:50,767 --> 00:03:53,201
Isn't that that Bania guy?

66
00:03:53,727 --> 00:03:56,764
Oh, no. It is. Just be still.</i>

67
00:03:56,927 --> 00:03:59,316
Too late. I think
he picked up the scent.</i>

68
00:04:00,127 --> 00:04:02,561
Hey, Jerry, I didn't know
you liked soup.</i>

69
00:04:02,767 --> 00:04:04,200
Hard to believe.</i>

70
00:04:04,367 --> 00:04:06,835
This guy makes the best soup
in the city, Jerry. The best.</i>

71
00:04:07,007 --> 00:04:08,918
You know what they call him?
"Soup Nazi."</i>

72
00:04:09,087 --> 00:04:10,122
All right, Bania.

73
00:04:10,287 --> 00:04:12,881
- I'm not letting you cut in line.
- Why not?</i>

74
00:04:13,047 --> 00:04:15,003
If he catches us,
we'll never get soup again.</i>

75
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:16,600
Okay, okay.

76
00:04:26,287 --> 00:04:28,642
Medium turkey chili.</i>

77
00:04:31,247 --> 00:04:33,078
Medium crab bisque.</i>

78
00:04:39,167 --> 00:04:42,284
- I didn't get any bread.
- Just forget it. Let it go.</i>

79
00:04:44,687 --> 00:04:46,996
Excuse me.
I think you forgot my bread.</i>

80
00:04:47,167 --> 00:04:48,520
Bread, $2.00 extra.</i>

81
00:04:48,687 --> 00:04:51,155
Two dollars? But everyone
in front of me got free bread.</i>

82
00:04:51,487 --> 00:04:53,079
- You want bread?
- Yes, please.</i>

83
00:04:53,247 --> 00:04:54,839
Three dollars!</i>

84
00:04:55,447 --> 00:04:56,926
- What?
- No soup for you!

85
00:05:07,487 --> 00:05:09,637
What do you mean,
I can't bring it in? I live here.</i>

86
00:05:09,807 --> 00:05:11,638
It's Sunday.
There's no moving on Sunday.</i>

87
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:14,196
- That's the rule.
- But I didn't know, Tom.</i>

88
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:17,518
Can't you just make an exception?
Please? I've got a nice face.</i>

89
00:05:18,327 --> 00:05:19,965
Tomorrow, okay?
You move it in tomorrow.</i>

90
00:05:20,127 --> 00:05:21,321
I'll even give you a hand.</i>

91
00:05:22,647 --> 00:05:25,207
- You're gonna have to hold it.
- I'm the guy on the sidewalk.</i>

92
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:26,641
I don't have layaway.</i>

93
00:05:26,807 --> 00:05:29,082
Oh, no. Please don't go.</i>

94
00:05:29,247 --> 00:05:31,920
Please. Please don't walk away.</i>

95
00:05:33,287 --> 00:05:35,005
Oh, man.

96
00:05:38,727 --> 00:05:41,321
Oh, this is fantastic.

97
00:05:43,767 --> 00:05:45,723
How does he do it?</i>

98
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:49,325
I don't see how you can sit there
eating, and not even offer me any?</i>

99
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,684
I gave you a taste.
What do you want?</i>

100
00:05:51,887 --> 00:05:54,526
- Why can't we share?
- I told you not to say anything.</i>

101
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:58,043
You can't go in there, flout the rules,
and then think I'm gonna share.</i>

102
00:05:58,207 --> 00:06:01,324
- Do you hear you yourself?
- I'm sorry.</i>

103
00:06:01,487 --> 00:06:04,684
This is what comes
from living under a Nazi regime.</i>

104
00:06:05,447 --> 00:06:07,642
Well, I gotta go back there
and try again.</i>

105
00:06:08,687 --> 00:06:09,881
- Hi.
- Hi.

106
00:06:10,047 --> 00:06:11,321
- Hi, Schmoopie.
- Hi, Schmoopie.</i>

107
00:06:11,487 --> 00:06:13,842
- No, you're Schmoopie.
- You're Schmoopie.</i>

108
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:15,963
- Going.
- Hey, listen...</i>

109
00:06:16,127 --> 00:06:18,357
...so we'll meet you and Susan
at the movie tonight?</i>

110
00:06:19,167 --> 00:06:21,317
You know what? I changed my mind.
I don't think so.</i>

111
00:06:21,487 --> 00:06:23,876
- Why?
- I just don't feel like it anymore.</i>

112
00:06:24,127 --> 00:06:27,483
- Just like that?
- Just like that.</i>

113
00:06:29,087 --> 00:06:30,998
Boy, he's a weird guy, isn't he?</i>

114
00:06:31,727 --> 00:06:33,558
- Hey.
- Hey.</i>

115
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:37,722
Yeah.</i>

116
00:06:37,887 --> 00:06:40,526
Hey, hey, hey.
What are you doing?</i>

117
00:06:40,687 --> 00:06:43,042
Elaine has to leave her armoire
on the street all night.</i>

118
00:06:43,207 --> 00:06:44,606
I'm gonna guard it for her.</i>

119
00:06:44,767 --> 00:06:46,519
I need something to sit on.</i>

120
00:06:46,687 --> 00:06:48,598
Well, sit on one of your cushions.</i>

121
00:06:48,767 --> 00:06:51,440
But this is so nice and thick.</i>

122
00:06:55,847 --> 00:06:57,075
Ahoy, there.</i>

123
00:06:57,247 --> 00:06:59,203
Oh, Kramer, thank God.</i>

124
00:06:59,367 --> 00:07:02,518
- I really appreciate your doing this.
- Well, you asked for it, you got it.</i>

125
00:07:02,687 --> 00:07:04,245
Do you need anything?</i>

126
00:07:04,407 --> 00:07:06,841
Well, a hot bowl of mulagatani
would hit the spot.</i>

127
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,884
- Mulagatani?
- Yeah, it's an Indian soup.</i>

128
00:07:09,367 --> 00:07:10,516
Simmered to perfection...</i>

129
00:07:10,687 --> 00:07:13,201
...by one of the great
soup artisans in the modern era.</i>

130
00:07:14,327 --> 00:07:15,806
Who, the Soup Nazi?</i>

131
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,116
He's not a Nazi.</i>

132
00:07:17,287 --> 00:07:19,642
He just happens to be
a little eccentric.</i>

133
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,240
You know, most geniuses are.</i>

134
00:07:22,207 --> 00:07:23,720
- I'll be back.
- Wait a second.</i>

135
00:07:23,887 --> 00:07:25,878
- You don't know how to order.
- No, I got it.</i>

136
00:07:26,047 --> 00:07:28,607
- No, Elaine.
- Hey, I got it.</i>

137
00:07:33,767 --> 00:07:36,839
Hey, didn't you already get soup?</i>

138
00:07:37,007 --> 00:07:38,884
No, I didn't get it.</i>

139
00:07:39,247 --> 00:07:41,124
Why? What happened?</i>

140
00:07:41,287 --> 00:07:43,198
I made a mistake.</i>

141
00:07:43,807 --> 00:07:45,320
Well, we'll see
what happens to you.</i>

142
00:07:45,487 --> 00:07:47,478
Yeah, no, listen, George,
I am quite certain...</i>

143
00:07:47,647 --> 00:07:50,161
...I'm walking out of there
with a bowl of soup.</i>

144
00:07:50,327 --> 00:07:52,079
Let me ask you something.
Is it just me...</i>

145
00:07:52,247 --> 00:07:55,000
...or do you find it unbearable
to be around Jerry and that girl?</i>

146
00:07:55,167 --> 00:07:56,919
Oh, I know.

147
00:07:57,087 --> 00:07:58,236
It's awful.

148
00:07:58,407 --> 00:08:00,045
Why do they do that
in front of people?</i>

149
00:08:00,207 --> 00:08:02,243
- I don't know.
- What is that with the Schmoopie?</i>

150
00:08:02,407 --> 00:08:04,318
- Schmoopie.
- Oh, stop it. I know.</i>

151
00:08:04,487 --> 00:08:07,604
I had to listen to a discussion on
which one is actually called Schmoopie.</i>

152
00:08:07,767 --> 00:08:09,837
I cancelled plans
to go to the movies with them.</i>

153
00:08:10,007 --> 00:08:12,680
- You know, we should say something.
- We absolutely should.</i>

154
00:08:12,847 --> 00:08:15,759
I mean, why does he do that?
Doesn't he know what a turnoff that is?</i>

155
00:08:15,927 --> 00:08:17,440
- He can be so weird sometimes.
- Yes.</i>

156
00:08:17,607 --> 00:08:19,279
- I haven't figured him out.
- Me neither.</i>

157
00:08:19,887 --> 00:08:21,684
I gotta focus.
I'm shifting into soup mode.</i>

158
00:08:21,847 --> 00:08:23,644
Oh, God.

159
00:08:29,407 --> 00:08:31,398
Good afternoon.</i>

160
00:08:31,807 --> 00:08:34,685
One large crab bisque to go.</i>

161
00:08:40,927 --> 00:08:43,157
Bread. Beautiful.</i>

162
00:08:43,327 --> 00:08:45,921
You're pushing your luck, little man.</i>

163
00:08:48,767 --> 00:08:51,565
Sorry. Thank you. Thank you.

164
00:08:51,767 --> 00:08:53,246
Hey, there.</i>

165
00:08:57,607 --> 00:09:02,123
Oh, one mulagatani, and...</i>

166
00:09:02,527 --> 00:09:04,199
What is that there?
Is that lima bean?</i>

167
00:09:04,527 --> 00:09:07,519
- Yes.
- Never been a big fan.</i>

168
00:09:10,367 --> 00:09:11,402
You know what?

169
00:09:11,567 --> 00:09:14,127
Has anyone ever told you
you look exactly like Al Pacino?</i>

170
00:09:15,487 --> 00:09:17,443
You know, Scent of a Woman.</i>

171
00:09:20,367 --> 00:09:21,925
Very good. Very good.</i>

172
00:09:22,087 --> 00:09:24,203
You know something?
No soup for you!</i>

173
00:09:24,607 --> 00:09:26,916
- What?
- Come back, one year!</i>

174
00:09:27,847 --> 00:09:28,882
Next!</i>

175
00:09:30,607 --> 00:09:33,201
- Look at this.
- It's an antique.</i>

176
00:09:33,367 --> 00:09:35,961
It's all handmade,
and I love the inlay.</i>

177
00:09:36,127 --> 00:09:37,640
Yes, yes. Me too.</i>

178
00:09:38,807 --> 00:09:41,082
It's gorgeous, completely. Pick it up.</i>

179
00:09:41,487 --> 00:09:43,796
- Pick it up from the bottom.
- Wait, what are you doing?</i>

180
00:09:43,967 --> 00:09:46,356
What does it look like we're doing?
We're taking this.</i>

181
00:09:46,727 --> 00:09:49,036
You can't take this.
This belongs to a friend of mine.</i>

182
00:09:49,207 --> 00:09:50,799
Look, you wanna get hurt?</i>

183
00:09:51,207 --> 00:09:54,358
I don't think you wanna get hurt.
If you wanna get hurt, I can hurt you.</i>

184
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:55,721
Now, just back off.

185
00:09:56,167 --> 00:09:57,919
- Bob.
- Just pick it up.

186
00:09:58,087 --> 00:09:59,600
Hey, what is this, huh?</i>

187
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:02,645
You have some kind of problem?
What is it you're not understanding?</i>

188
00:10:02,807 --> 00:10:05,162
We're taking the armoire,
and that's all there is to it.</i>

189
00:10:05,327 --> 00:10:06,919
Okay?

190
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:17,766
I mean, is he allowed to do this?</i>

191
00:10:17,927 --> 00:10:19,246
It's discrimination.

192
00:10:19,407 --> 00:10:21,318
I'm gonna call the state's
attorney's office.</i>

193
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:23,921
This is fabulous, my God.
Elaine, you have to taste this.</i>

194
00:10:24,087 --> 00:10:25,725
All right, all right.
Give me a taste.</i>

195
00:10:30,567 --> 00:10:33,400
- Oh, my God. I've gotta sit down.
- Yeah.</i>

196
00:10:39,127 --> 00:10:41,482
What happened?
Where's my armoire?</i>

197
00:10:42,207 --> 00:10:43,925
- It was stolen.
- What?</i>

198
00:10:44,087 --> 00:10:45,725
These street toughs,
they robbed me.</i>

199
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:48,922
Street toughs took my armoire?</i>

200
00:10:49,087 --> 00:10:51,362
Yeah, it was very frightening.</i>

201
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:52,846
My life was in danger.</i>

202
00:10:53,007 --> 00:10:54,918
You should've seen
the way they talked to me.</i>

203
00:10:55,607 --> 00:10:57,996
- I can't believe this!
- So where's the soup?</i>

204
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:00,198
The Soup Nazi threw me out.</i>

205
00:11:01,087 --> 00:11:02,998
Yeah!</i>

206
00:11:05,767 --> 00:11:08,361
- What are you gonna get?
- I'll decide at the last minute.</i>

207
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:10,319
You better decide, sister.
You're on deck.</i>

208
00:11:11,247 --> 00:11:12,805
Sheila!</i>

209
00:11:14,647 --> 00:11:16,558
What is this?
You're kissing in my line?</i>

210
00:11:16,727 --> 00:11:18,206
Nobody kisses in my line.</i>

211
00:11:19,087 --> 00:11:22,636
- I can kiss anywhere I want to.
- You just cost yourself a soup.</i>

212
00:11:23,287 --> 00:11:24,436
How dare you?</i>

213
00:11:24,607 --> 00:11:26,996
Come on, Jerry, we're leaving.</i>

214
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:30,921
Jerry?</i>

215
00:11:37,207 --> 00:11:39,277
Do I know you?

216
00:11:44,927 --> 00:11:48,761
So essentially,
you chose soup over a woman?</i>

217
00:11:49,567 --> 00:11:51,523
It was a bisque.</i>

218
00:11:52,767 --> 00:11:54,598
Yeah, you know what
I've just realized?</i>

219
00:11:54,767 --> 00:11:58,203
Suddenly, George has become
much more normal than you.</i>

220
00:11:58,367 --> 00:12:00,437
- Really?
- Yeah. Well, I mean, think about it.</i>

221
00:12:00,607 --> 00:12:02,359
He's engaged to be married.</i>

222
00:12:02,527 --> 00:12:04,757
Your top priority is soup.

223
00:12:04,927 --> 00:12:06,440
Have you tasted the soup?</i>

224
00:12:07,207 --> 00:12:09,516
Yeah, all right.
You made the right decision.</i>

225
00:12:10,407 --> 00:12:13,160
See, it's much easier
to patch things up with Sheila...</i>

226
00:12:13,327 --> 00:12:14,840
...than with the Soup Nazi.</i>

227
00:12:16,047 --> 00:12:17,924
- Hey.
- Hey.</i>

228
00:12:18,087 --> 00:12:19,759
- Oh, thanks.
- There he is.</i>

229
00:12:19,927 --> 00:12:22,680
Elaine, I'm really sorry
about the armoire.</i>

230
00:12:22,847 --> 00:12:23,882
Yeah, I know. Me too.</i>

231
00:12:24,047 --> 00:12:26,845
- So did these thieves want any money?
- No.</i>

232
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,885
- They just wanted the armoire?
- Yeah, they were quite taken with it.</i>

233
00:12:31,567 --> 00:12:33,080
Yeah.</i>

234
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,247
Have you noticed
George is acting a little strange lately?</i>

235
00:12:37,407 --> 00:12:38,635
No. In what way?

236
00:12:38,807 --> 00:12:41,799
I don't know. A lot of attitude,
like he's better than me.</i>

237
00:12:41,967 --> 00:12:44,765
I don't think George has ever thought
he's better than anybody.</i>

238
00:12:45,447 --> 00:12:47,085
- Hello.
- Hello.</i>

239
00:12:47,247 --> 00:12:48,600
- Hello.
- Hello.</i>

240
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:52,435
Were you just talking about me?
What's going on?</i>

241
00:12:53,567 --> 00:12:54,841
Absolutely not.</i>

242
00:12:55,807 --> 00:12:57,445
- Something's going on here.
- All right.</i>

243
00:12:57,607 --> 00:12:58,960
I'm gonna go get some soup.</i>

244
00:12:59,127 --> 00:13:01,402
One of these days,
that guy is gonna get his.</i>

245
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,159
So how was the movie?</i>

246
00:13:03,327 --> 00:13:05,966
We didn't go.
Sheila and I are kind of on the outs.</i>

247
00:13:06,487 --> 00:13:08,125
Oh, yeah?</i>

248
00:13:09,167 --> 00:13:10,361
Yeah.</i>

249
00:13:12,287 --> 00:13:13,925
What, are you happy?</i>

250
00:13:14,647 --> 00:13:17,115
- Happy? Why should I be happy?
- I don't know.</i>

251
00:13:17,287 --> 00:13:19,164
But you look like you're happy.</i>

252
00:13:19,327 --> 00:13:20,646
Why should I care?</i>

253
00:13:20,847 --> 00:13:22,075
You can't fool me.</i>

254
00:13:22,247 --> 00:13:24,442
Don't insult me,
because I know when you're happy.</i>

255
00:13:25,447 --> 00:13:27,802
All right, I am happy.
And I'll tell you why.</i>

256
00:13:27,967 --> 00:13:31,118
The two of you were making me
and every one of your friends sick.</i>

257
00:13:31,287 --> 00:13:33,278
Right, Elaine?</i>

258
00:13:36,767 --> 00:13:37,961
Is that so?

259
00:13:38,127 --> 00:13:41,597
Yeah. With all that kissing and the
"Schmoopie, Schmoopie, Schmoopie."</i>

260
00:13:41,767 --> 00:13:44,201
- Out in public like that. It's disgusting.
- Disgusting?</i>

261
00:13:44,367 --> 00:13:46,597
People who do that
should be arrested.</i>

262
00:13:46,847 --> 00:13:49,236
I guess I have all the more reason
to get back with her.</i>

263
00:13:49,407 --> 00:13:52,126
And we had a pact, you know.</i>

264
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:55,956
- What?
- You shook my hand.

265
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:57,560
You're still with the pact?</i>

266
00:13:57,727 --> 00:14:00,082
- You reneged.
- All I did was shake your hand.</i>

267
00:14:05,207 --> 00:14:08,085
And then they just ran off
with the armoire, just like that.</i>

268
00:14:08,487 --> 00:14:09,681
This city.

269
00:14:11,207 --> 00:14:12,765
One large jambalaya, please.</i>

270
00:14:20,407 --> 00:14:24,002
- So continue.
- My friend is awfully disappointed.</i>

271
00:14:24,167 --> 00:14:26,078
You know, she's very emotional.</i>

272
00:14:26,847 --> 00:14:28,405
Thank you.

273
00:14:33,887 --> 00:14:36,003
Jambalaya.

274
00:14:37,047 --> 00:14:39,481
All right, now listen to me.
You have been a good friend.</i>

275
00:14:39,647 --> 00:14:41,080
I have an armoire in my basement.</i>

276
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:43,442
If you want to pick it up,
you're welcome to it.</i>

277
00:14:43,607 --> 00:14:45,563
So take it, it's yours.</i>

278
00:14:45,727 --> 00:14:47,479
How can I possibly thank you?

279
00:14:47,647 --> 00:14:49,399
You are the only one
who understands me.</i>

280
00:14:49,567 --> 00:14:52,127
- You suffer for your soup.
- Yes, that is right.</i>

281
00:14:52,287 --> 00:14:55,165
You demand perfection
from yourself, from your soup.</i>

282
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:57,522
How can I tolerate any less
from my customers?</i>

283
00:14:58,327 --> 00:14:59,919
Gazpacho, por fav or.</i>

284
00:15:00,247 --> 00:15:03,478
- "Por fav or"?
- Oh, I'm part Spanish.</i>

285
00:15:03,967 --> 00:15:05,480
Adios, muchacho.</i>

286
00:15:06,567 --> 00:15:08,922
You heard him. Get out.</i>

287
00:15:11,687 --> 00:15:13,086
It was stupid of me.</i>

288
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:14,521
Well, it was very insulting.</i>

289
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:16,757
No, I know.
I was really sort of half kidding.</i>

290
00:15:17,287 --> 00:15:19,926
Well, behind every joke
there's some truth.</i>

291
00:15:20,167 --> 00:15:22,203
Well, what about that
Bavarian cream pie joke?</i>

292
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,595
There's no truth to that.</i>

293
00:15:23,767 --> 00:15:25,803
Nobody with a terminal illness
goes to Europe...</i>

294
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:27,639
...for a piece of Bavarian cream pie...</i>

295
00:15:27,807 --> 00:15:31,243
...and then when they don't have it,
he says, "I'll just have some coffee."</i>

296
00:15:31,447 --> 00:15:35,156
- There's no truth to that.
- Well, I guess you're right.</i>

297
00:15:35,607 --> 00:15:39,122
- So am I forgiven, Schmoopie?
- Yes, Schmoopie.</i>

298
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:43,638
- Hey, Jerry.
- Oh, hi, Susan.</i>

299
00:15:43,807 --> 00:15:45,399
George. You remember Sheila.</i>

300
00:15:45,567 --> 00:15:47,876
- Oh, yes. Hello.
- Hello. Won't you join us?</i>

301
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:50,083
- No, thanks. Yes.
- Of course.</i>

302
00:15:52,767 --> 00:15:54,962
So...

303
00:15:55,127 --> 00:15:56,924
...you sit on the same side
in a booth?</i>

304
00:15:57,087 --> 00:15:59,123
Yeah, that's right.
You got a problem?</i>

305
00:16:00,367 --> 00:16:04,918
I just think it's a little unusual
for two people to sit on one side...</i>

306
00:16:05,087 --> 00:16:06,998
...and leave the other side empty.</i>

307
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,078
Well, we're changing the rules.</i>

308
00:16:09,247 --> 00:16:10,839
Well, good for you.</i>

309
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,202
What are you getting, George?</i>

310
00:16:14,687 --> 00:16:17,884
I don't know, honey.
What do you wanna get?</i>

311
00:16:18,047 --> 00:16:21,084
I want you to get anything you want.</i>

312
00:16:22,167 --> 00:16:25,159
Because I love you so much,
and I want you to be happy.</i>

313
00:16:25,327 --> 00:16:26,760
Okay, sweetie?</i>

314
00:16:26,927 --> 00:16:28,758
Oh, George, you're so sweet.</i>

315
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:31,760
Well, I can be a little
sweetie-tweetie-wheetie-wheetie.</i>

316
00:16:33,567 --> 00:16:35,683
What about you, Schmoopie?
How about a little tuna?</i>

317
00:16:35,847 --> 00:16:39,237
- You want a little tuna fishy?
- Yeah, a little tuna fishy.</i>

318
00:16:39,807 --> 00:16:41,206
Fishy.

319
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:42,959
Come here.</i>

320
00:16:53,727 --> 00:16:55,399
And voilà!

321
00:16:55,567 --> 00:16:58,365
- Yeah.
- Oh, I love it!</i>

322
00:16:58,527 --> 00:16:59,960
I absolutely love it!</i>

323
00:17:00,127 --> 00:17:02,197
Yeah, did the K-Man do it
or did the K-Man do it?</i>

324
00:17:02,367 --> 00:17:04,119
- The K-man did it!
- Yeah!</i>

325
00:17:04,287 --> 00:17:06,596
- How much did you pay for this?
- How about zero?</i>

326
00:17:06,767 --> 00:17:09,327
What? What? Whose was it?
Where'd you get it?</i>

327
00:17:09,527 --> 00:17:10,755
I'll tell you where I got it.</i>

328
00:17:10,927 --> 00:17:13,646
From the guy you callously
refer to as the Soup Nazi.</i>

329
00:17:13,807 --> 00:17:15,763
Get out!</i>

330
00:17:18,367 --> 00:17:20,961
The Soap Nazi gave it to you?
Why?</i>

331
00:17:21,127 --> 00:17:24,676
Well, I told him the whole story,
and he just let me have it.</i>

332
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,044
Yeah, he's a wonderful man.</i>

333
00:17:27,207 --> 00:17:29,721
Yeah, you know,
a little bit misunderstood, but...</i>

334
00:17:29,887 --> 00:17:31,923
I'm gonna go down there
and personally thank him.</i>

335
00:17:32,087 --> 00:17:34,521
I mean, I had this guy all wrong.
This is wonderful.</i>

336
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:36,120
Yeah, well, he's a dear.</i>

337
00:17:39,167 --> 00:17:41,635
How much tip
do you leave on 8.15?</i>

338
00:17:41,807 --> 00:17:43,320
You know, sweetie...</i>

339
00:17:43,487 --> 00:17:46,160
...I just want you to know
that I was so proud of you today...

340
00:17:46,327 --> 00:17:49,160
...expressing your feelings
so freely in front of Jerry and all.</i>

341
00:17:49,327 --> 00:17:51,636
Just knowing that you're
not afraid of those things...</i>

342
00:17:51,807 --> 00:17:54,401
...it's such a great step forward
in our relationship.</i>

343
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:03,555
Because you love
your little Kiki, don't you?</i>

344
00:18:09,287 --> 00:18:12,120
- How is he today?
- I think he's in a good mood.</i>

345
00:18:13,407 --> 00:18:15,284
Hi.

346
00:18:15,447 --> 00:18:19,804
Kramer gave me the armoire,
and it is so beautiful.</i>

347
00:18:19,967 --> 00:18:24,563
I mean, I just can't tell you
how much I appreciate it.</i>

348
00:18:24,727 --> 00:18:28,686
You? If I knew it was for you,
I never would have given it to him!</i>

349
00:18:28,847 --> 00:18:31,964
I would have taken a hatchet
and smashed it to pieces.</i>

350
00:18:32,127 --> 00:18:33,799
Now, who wants soup?

351
00:18:34,007 --> 00:18:36,077
Next, speak up.</i>

352
00:18:42,007 --> 00:18:44,123
I'm headed over to Elaine's.</i>

353
00:18:44,407 --> 00:18:47,843
Jerry, those are the guys
that mugged me for the armoire.</i>

354
00:18:48,047 --> 00:18:49,878
- Those two? Are you sure?
- That's them.</i>

355
00:18:50,727 --> 00:18:52,524
- Let's confront them.
- No, let's get a cop.</i>

356
00:18:52,687 --> 00:18:54,598
There's no cops around.
They're gonna leave.</i>

357
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:55,756
Come on, let's go.</i>

358
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:57,246
Wow, look,
that one is gorgeous.</i>

359
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,760
I would just kill for that one.</i>

360
00:18:58,927 --> 00:19:00,724
No, not in blue.
Blue does not go at all.</i>

361
00:19:00,887 --> 00:19:02,479
Do you know what
you're talking about?</i>

362
00:19:02,647 --> 00:19:05,798
I don't think you know what you're
talking about. Take a look at that.</i>

363
00:19:05,967 --> 00:19:07,036
Excuse me.</i>

364
00:19:08,327 --> 00:19:10,045
- Are you talking to me?
- Well...</i>

365
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:12,596
I said, are you talking to me?</i>

366
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,883
Well, maybe he was talking to me.</i>

367
00:19:15,047 --> 00:19:16,241
Was you talking to him?

368
00:19:16,407 --> 00:19:18,363
Because you was
obviously talking to one of us.</i>

369
00:19:18,527 --> 00:19:21,246
So what is it? Who?
Who was you talking to?

370
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,755
We were kind of
talking to each other.</i>

371
00:19:26,927 --> 00:19:28,724
Weren't we?</i>

372
00:19:34,647 --> 00:19:37,559
I mean, you know, I've never been
so insulted in my entire life.</i>

373
00:19:37,727 --> 00:19:39,683
There's something really wrong
with this man.</i>

374
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:41,724
He is a Soup Nazi.</i>

375
00:19:43,647 --> 00:19:47,003
- What? What is that?
- I don't know.

376
00:19:47,167 --> 00:19:48,998
"Five cups chopped
porcini mushroom...</i>

377
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:51,806
...half a cup of olive oil,
three pounds of celery...</i>

378
00:19:51,967 --> 00:19:53,446
- ... chopped parsley-"
- Let me see.</i>

379
00:19:54,447 --> 00:19:56,483
You know what this is?
This is a recipe for soup.</i>

380
00:19:56,647 --> 00:19:58,842
Look at this. There are like
30 different recipes.</i>

381
00:19:59,007 --> 00:20:00,759
These are his recipes.</i>

382
00:20:00,927 --> 00:20:02,519
- So?
- So?

383
00:20:02,967 --> 00:20:04,844
His secret's out. Don't you see?</i>

384
00:20:05,007 --> 00:20:07,157
I could give these
to every restaurant in town.</i>

385
00:20:07,327 --> 00:20:08,601
I could have them published.</i>

386
00:20:08,767 --> 00:20:11,964
I could drop fliers
from a plane above the city.</i>

387
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:13,845
Wait, where do you think
you're going?</i>

388
00:20:14,007 --> 00:20:14,996
What do you care?</i>

389
00:20:15,167 --> 00:20:17,556
I don't want you causing trouble
down at that soup stand.</i>

390
00:20:17,727 --> 00:20:18,796
I love that soup.</i>

391
00:20:19,007 --> 00:20:22,363
- Get out of my way, Jerry.
- Elaine, let the man make his soup.</i>

392
00:20:22,527 --> 00:20:24,882
Don't make me hurt you, Jerry.</i>

393
00:20:25,247 --> 00:20:26,999
Look, they have it in blue.</i>

394
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:28,646
For my baby bluey.</i>

395
00:20:28,807 --> 00:20:32,356
- Are you my baby bluey?
- Oh, yes, I'm your baby bluey.</i>

396
00:20:32,527 --> 00:20:34,518
Oh, yes.</i>

397
00:20:35,087 --> 00:20:36,600
Well, well.</i>

398
00:20:36,767 --> 00:20:39,804
- Hi, Jerry.
- Hey, Susan, George.</i>

399
00:20:39,967 --> 00:20:41,719
You know, I really like Sheila a lot.</i>

400
00:20:41,887 --> 00:20:45,357
Oh, really? Because we're kind of
not seeing each other anymore.</i>

401
00:20:45,567 --> 00:20:47,478
Oh, no, that's too bad.

402
00:20:47,647 --> 00:20:50,207
Yeah, well, she was
very affectionate, which I love.</i>

403
00:20:50,367 --> 00:20:51,641
You know I love that.</i>

404
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:55,676
But mentally we couldn't quite
make a connection.</i>

405
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:57,081
- Really?
- Yeah.</i>

406
00:20:57,247 --> 00:21:00,239
Too bad. You gotta have the affection,
which you obviously have.</i>

407
00:21:00,447 --> 00:21:03,598
I think it's great that you're so open
with your affections in public.</i>

408
00:21:03,767 --> 00:21:05,405
See, we had that.</i>

409
00:21:05,567 --> 00:21:07,603
- You did?
- Oh, yes.</i>

410
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,878
But the mental thing...</i>

411
00:21:10,047 --> 00:21:11,799
But, anyway...</i>

412
00:21:11,967 --> 00:21:14,356
- I'll see you.
- Yeah.</i>

413
00:21:14,887 --> 00:21:16,115
See you.</i>

414
00:21:16,487 --> 00:21:18,478
Go on, leave. Get out!</i>

415
00:21:18,647 --> 00:21:21,081
- But I didn't do anything.
- Next.</i>

416
00:21:24,647 --> 00:21:26,399
Hello.</i>

417
00:21:27,167 --> 00:21:28,316
You?

418
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:30,682
You think you can get soup?</i>

419
00:21:30,847 --> 00:21:32,519
Please, you're wasting
everyone's time.</i>

420
00:21:33,447 --> 00:21:35,005
I don't want soup.

421
00:21:35,167 --> 00:21:37,727
I can make my own soup.</i>

422
00:21:38,287 --> 00:21:41,245
"Five cups chopped
porcini mushrooms...</i>

423
00:21:41,407 --> 00:21:43,318
...half a cup of olive oil...</i>

424
00:21:43,487 --> 00:21:45,398
...three pounds celery."</i>

425
00:21:45,567 --> 00:21:47,478
That is my recipe for
wild mushroom.</i>

426
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:50,601
Yeah, that's right. I got them all.</i>

427
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:53,406
Cold cucumber,
corn and crab chowder.</i>

428
00:21:53,567 --> 00:21:55,637
- Mulagatani.
- Mulagatani?

429
00:21:56,127 --> 00:21:59,005
You're through, Soup Nazi.
Pack it up.</i>

430
00:21:59,487 --> 00:22:01,717
No more soup for you.</i>

431
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:03,559
Next!</i>

432
00:22:14,047 --> 00:22:15,162
Jerry, Jerry, Jerry!</i>

433
00:22:15,327 --> 00:22:17,238
- What is it?
- Something happened to Soup Nazi.</i>

434
00:22:17,407 --> 00:22:19,796
- What is the matter?
- Elaine's causing a commotion.</i>

435
00:22:19,967 --> 00:22:23,164
She got ahold of his recipes, and she's
gonna drive him out of business.</i>

436
00:22:23,327 --> 00:22:26,125
Now that his recipes are out
he's not gonna make any more soup!</i>

437
00:22:26,327 --> 00:22:28,602
He's moving out of the country!
Moving to Argentina!</i>

438
00:22:28,767 --> 00:22:30,837
No more soup, Jerry.
No more for any of us!</i>

439
00:22:31,007 --> 00:22:33,043
- Where you going?
- He's giving away what's left.</i>

440
00:22:33,207 --> 00:22:35,198
I gotta go home and get a big pot.</i>
