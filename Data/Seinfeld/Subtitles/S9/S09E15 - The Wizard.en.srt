1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:05,700
When are they gonna learn that 
any news about China is an instant page-turner?

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,200
What's that?

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,500
It's a Wizard electronic organizer for my dad. 

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm going to Florida for his birthday.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,700
How much was it?

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,300
Two hundred. 
But I'll tell him it's fifty. 

7
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,400
He doesn't care about the gift. 
He gets excited about the deal.

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,100
Where are you getting a Wizard for fifty dollars?

9
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,100
Ah, I'll tell him I got it 
on the street, and maybe it's hot. 

10
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,500
That's his favorite.

11
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,800
I got a message from the Rosses 
at work today.

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,400
Susan's parents? 
When's the last time you talked to them?

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,500
At the funeral, 
give or take. 

14
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,800
Deep down, I always kinda felt 
that they blamed me for Susan's death.

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,700
Why, because you picked out 
the poisoned envelopes? 

16
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,600
That's silly.

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,800
Oh, um... Darryl. 

18
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,300
These are... people I know. 

19
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,300
Jerry, George.

20
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,800
Nice meeting you. 

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,600
Ah, I gotta run, Elaine. 
I'll see you later.

22
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,400
OK.

23
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,700
Still no Puddy?

24
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:00,700
I think his answering machine's broken, 
so I just gave up. 

25
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,400
What do you think?

26
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,000
What? About you dating a black guy? 
What's the big deal?

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,200
What black guy?

28
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,900
Darryl. 
He's black, isn't he?

29
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,000
He is?

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,300
No, he isn't.

31
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,600
Isn't he, Elaine?

32
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,400
You think?

33
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,800
I thought he looked Irish.

34
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,500
What's his last name?

35
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,300
Nelson.

36
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,400
That's not Irish.

37
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,500
I think he's black.

38
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,000
Should we be talking about this?

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,800
I think it's OK.

40
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,800
No, it isn't.

41
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,600
Why not?

42
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,500
Well, it would be OK 
if Darryl was here.

43
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,700
If he's black.

44
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,800
Is he black?

45
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,900
Does it matter?

46
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,400
No, course not. 
I mean, I'd just like to know.

47
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,600
Oh, so you need to know?

48
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,600
No, I don't need to know. 
I just think it would be nice if I knew.

49
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,400
Should I take that?

50
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,500
Uh, one second.
- Oh, here.

51
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,500
Uh, yeah. Hang on.

52
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,400
Uh, Mrs. Ross? 
It's-it's George.

53
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,900
Who?

54
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,900
George Costanza. 
Susan's, uh, friend? 

55
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,600
Long time no speak.

56
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,600
We're all out of lime juice. 
I told that woman to buy more.

57
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
George, the Susan Ross Foundation 
is having an event this weekend.

58
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,600
Oh, I just, uh, leased a house out in the Hamptons, 

59
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,400
and I have got to get out there 
this weekend and sign the papers.

60
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,800
I'm going back to bed.

61
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,200
Thank you for calling, George.

62
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,200
Oh, sure. 

63
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,000
I mean, after all, 
you were almost my, uh... 

64
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
OK, I gotta go.

65
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,300
House in the Hamptons?

66
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,300
Well, you know, I've been lying 
about my income for a few years. 

67
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,100
I figured I could afford 
a fake house in the Hamptons.

68
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,400
Well.
- Hey.

69
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,500
Well, grab a cigar, boys.

70
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,100
Yeah, it's time to celebrate.

71
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,300
Wow. What are we celebrating?

72
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,000
Uh, you remember my coffee table book?

73
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
With the little legs?

74
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
That's the one. 

75
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
A big Hollywood so-and-so 
optioned it for a movie.

76
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,100
How are they gonna make 
that book into a movie?

77
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,700
You remember that photo book 
on toy ray guns?

78
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,700
Yeah?

79
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:08,100
Independence Day?

80
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,400
How much are they paying you?

81
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,300
Let's just say that I don't have to 
worry about working for a while.

82
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,700
A long while.

83
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,700
That's funny because 
I haven't seen you working for a while. 

84
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,400
A long while.

85
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,800
And you're not going to, 
because I'm hanging it up. 

86
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,200
Boys, I'm retiring.

87
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,800
From what?

88
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,200
From the grind. 
I mean, who needs it? 

89
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,000
I've accomplished everything 
I've set out to do.

90
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,900
What's that?

91
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,700
Oh. 

92
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,700
Bought myself a little retirement gift. Gold watch.

93
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,800
Ooh!

94
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,100
Well, it's not really gold.

95
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:48,100
Aww.

96
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,400
Hey.
- Hey.

97
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,600
Great music.

98
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,400
Oh, it's my neighbor.

99
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,800
They blast that stuff 24 hours a day.
I hate it.

100
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,800
Yo, you! 
Turn it down!

101
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,500
Oh, wow, these are nice.

102
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,700
Do they have any cultural significance?

103
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,500
They're... African.

104
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,800
Right. 
African.

105
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,800
Well, not Africa, actually. 
South Africa.

106
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,900
South Africa.

107
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,000
My family used to live there, 

108
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,700
but, we got out years ago, 
for obvious reasons. 

109
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,300
You know how it is.

110
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,000
Maybe.

111
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,500
You must hate hot dogs, huh? 

112
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,500
Or else, you really like them 
and that's why you do this.

113
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,300
I'll tell you, 
if I had one of these things, 

114
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,600
I'd be eating hot dogs all the time.

115
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,600
Are you gonna buy a hot dog or not?

116
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,600
Mmm... no.

117
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,800
Rise and shine, sleepyhead!

118
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,800
It's 5:30 in the morning!

119
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,700
We let you sleep in.

120
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,300
Well, as long as I'm up. 

121
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,800
Dad, I got you a birthday present. 

122
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,700
Here. 
Happy Birthday.

123
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,000
Aw, Jerry. 
I should be buying you presents.

124
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,900
What does that mean?

125
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,900
Leave your father alone. 
It's his birthday.

126
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,400
Oooh! 
It's a radar detector.

127
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,400
Radar detector? I've never seen you 
go over twenty miles an hour.

128
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,800
You're like the Grand Marshall 
of the Rose Bowl Parade.

129
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,000
It's a Wizard organizer.

130
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,400
This looks like too much money.

131
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,100
Nah, I got it from a guy on the street. 

132
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,400
It was, like, fifty bucks.

133
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,100
You think it's hot?

134
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,300
Could be.

135
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,600
Attaboy! 

136
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,100
Helen, Jerry got me a hot Wizard computer!

137
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,100
I'm right here.

138
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,200
And you can do everything with it. 

139
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,700
You can get email, fax, 
there's a calculator.

140
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,000
So, I can use it in the restaurant 
to figure out the tip?

141
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,200
Yeah, I guess. 

142
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,200
But the really cool thing 
is the daily planner.

143
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,600
Helen, we got into restaurants 
and figure out the tips.

144
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,600
Jerry, 
you're getting your father too excited.

145
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,600
Hey, buddy. 
When'd you get here?

146
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Kramer, what are you doing here?

147
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I told you I was retiring. 
I moved in next door.

148
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,400
Mr. Kornstein died, 
and it's a beautiful apartment.

149
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,400
Yeah, your folks said it was for rent, 
so I jumped on it.

150
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:31,300
Kramer, you can't live down here. 
This is where people come to die.

151
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,200
Not you. 
Older people.

152
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,100
Don't eat cookies for breakfast!

153
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,700
I'll fix you something. 
How 'bout a feta cheese omelette?

154
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,800
Mmmm, that sounds great, Mom.

155
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,600
If you feed him, 
he'll never leave.

156
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,600
We don't have any feta. 
How about cottage cheese and Egg Beaters?

157
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,100
I guess.

158
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,300
I don't believe this.

159
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:59,300
I know, I know. 
Don't I look more relaxed?

160
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,300
So George, do you have any thoughts 
on this Darryl situation?

161
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,000
Actually, I did have a thought.

162
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,600
Oh.

163
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,800
Why don't you just ask him?

164
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,800
Because if I ask him, 
then it's like I really want to know.

165
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,500
Maybe he's, um...

166
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,200
... mixed.

167
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,700
Is that the right word?

168
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,800
I really don't think we're supposed 
to be talking about this.

169
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,400
Yeah.

170
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,600
I'm just gonna go to the bathroom.

171
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,000
You know what, I'm leaving.
- Yeah.

172
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'll just talk to Jerry 
when he gets back.

173
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,300
Oh. 
Mrs. Ross, Mr. Ross.

174
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,900
Oh, you're George's friend.

175
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,100
We saw him in the city this weekend. 

176
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,600
What happened to his 
place in the Hamptons?

177
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,600
The Hamptons? 
George Costanza? 

178
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,500
I don't think so. 

179
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,500
Have a good one.

180
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,200
Rosses.

181
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,200
George, we were just talking about you.

182
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,800
Well, sorry I missed that, uh, 
charity thing. 

183
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,800
But this was one of those truly glorious 
Hampton weekends that you always hear about.

184
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,700
Really?

185
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,900
Yeah, I may move out there.

186
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,800
I mean it, 
I'll do it! 

187
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,000
OK, I'll see you later.

188
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Keep it real!

189
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,700
Another fine meal, 
and now for my Wizard tip calculator.

190
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,000
Dad, it's got lots of other functions.

191
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,800
Don't worry. 
I'll get to the other functions.

192
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,100
I can't get it open.

193
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,100
Yay! Jerry got it open.

194
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,200
The service was slow. 
And God forbid they should refill the water.

195
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,300
How does 12.4% sound?

196
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:30,300
Well, your tip is 4 dollars 
and 36.6666 cents.

197
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,400
We'll round down.

198
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,800
Jerry, it was so nice of you 
to come down here on your father's birthday. 

199
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,300
You've helped take his mind 
off the condo election.

200
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:40,900
Oh, right. 

201
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,300
You can't run for condo president because 
you were impeached at the other condo.

202
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,500
I was never impeached! 
I resigned!

203
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,400
Even so, 
the press would bury him!

204
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,700
What press?

205
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,500
The condo newsletter, 
the Boca Breeze.

206
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,500
Pinko Commie rag.

207
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,700
Hey, Morty.

208
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:05,700
Your boy here, he just got a date 
with that young aquacise instructor.

209
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,400
She's fifty.

210
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,600
You know what he's got? 

211
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,600
He's got charisma. 
That's my man.

212
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,200
All right, 
I'll see you guys.

213
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:20,400
Yeah.

214
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,500
Morty, what're you looking at?

215
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,200
I'll tell you what I'm looking at: 

216
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,200
the next condo president 
of Del Boca Vista, Phase Three.

217
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,500
Elaine, thank you for the Wizard!

218
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,000
Wow, it's got so many functions.

219
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,700
Yeah, yeah. 
Forget about all that. 

220
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:46,700
First thing is first. 
Warranty information. 

221
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,100
Name, we know that. 

222
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,200
Uh, hobbies. 
Skiing, racquetball...

223
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,100
Well, I don't do that stuff.

224
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,400
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, 
it doesn't matter. 

225
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,000
Oh, here's one: race.

226
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,300
Isn't that optional?

227
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,300
It certainly should be.

228
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,300
It's nobody's damn business! 

229
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,500
But they really would like to know.

230
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,800
All right, then... 
Asian.

231
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,400
What?

232
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,900
Just to mess with 'em.

233
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:15,800
Oh. Right. 
Good one.

234
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,900
Average income, uh...

235
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,300
over a hundred thousand.

236
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,200
Really?

237
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,600
Does that matter?

238
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,600
No, but... 

239
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,600
it is very nice to know.

240
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,700
So did you figure out Darryl's... 

241
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,400
you know.

242
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,400
Ah, I've given up. 

243
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,300
So, now we're going to 
a bunch of Spanish restaurants. 

244
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,700
I figure that'll cover us either way.

245
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,300
You're a master of race relations.

246
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:49,800
Hey, so Kramer's running for 
president of the condo?

247
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,500
Yeah, it's all my father's doing.

248
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,500
He wants to install Kramer in a puppet regime 
and then wield power from behind the scenes. 

249
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,400
Preferably from the sauna in the clubhouse.

250
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,900
Who are they running against?

251
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:06,800
Common sense 
and a guy in a wheelchair.

252
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,600
Jerry?

253
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,300
He's still 
down with his folks.

254
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,400
What are you doing here?

255
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,500
Elaine, Elaine--

256
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,100
I'm getting his mail.

257
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,800
Oh, no.

258
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,100
He asked you to get the mail?

259
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,400
Mm-hmm.

260
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,300
Jerry, why is Elaine 
getting your mail?

261
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,300
George, listen to me. 
I have a very important job for you. 

262
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,100
I want you to come by twice a day 
and flush the toilet,

263
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:30,100
so the gaskets don't dry out and leak.

264
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,700
What?

265
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,600
What about the mail?

266
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,600
This is far more important. 
You must exercise the gaskets, George.

267
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,800
All right, Jerry. 
I'll do it. 

268
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,700
See you.

269
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,500
So, I ran into the Rosses again.

270
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,200
Oh, right, at the coffee shop. 

271
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,200
Where did they get the idea that 
you have a place in the Hamptons?

272
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,500
From me.

273
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,200
What did you say?

274
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,600
I told them 
I have a place in the Hamptons. 

275
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,100
What did you say?

276
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,800
I told them you didn't. 

277
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,800
And I laughed and I laughed.

278
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,900
So, they knew?

279
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,400
Those liars!

280
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,800
But you lied first.

281
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,000
Yeah, but they let me go on and on 
all about the Hamptons!

282
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,200
They never said a thing! 

283
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,000
You don't let somebody lie 
when they know you're lying.

284
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,400
You call them a liar!

285
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,400
Like you're a liar!

286
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,700
Yes. Thank you! 
Is that so hard?

287
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,400
So, this is over, not over? 

288
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,100
I'm betting, not over.

289
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,000
Not by a long shot. 

290
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,800
I'm calling up the Rosses and inviting them 
up to my non-existent place in the Hamptons. 

291
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,000
Then we'll see who blinks first.

292
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,700
Haven't you done enough 
to these people?

293
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,200
This is not about them. 

294
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,200
Now, if you'll excuse me, 
I have to exercise Jerry's gaskets.

295
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,900
Vote for Kramer.

296
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,000
Cosmo Kramer. 
I'm running for condo president.

297
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I'd like your vote. 
Thanks.

298
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Remember, ma'am, 
a vote for me is a vote for Kramer.

299
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,500
Can you cut my meat?

300
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,500
Gladly.

301
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:33,800
Coffee?

302
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,700
Sure.

303
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,700
Are you black?

304
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,500
Or should I bring some cream.

305
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,700
I'm black.

306
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,600
Oh, you know what? 
Bring a little cream.

307
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,900
Look at that.

308
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,100
Did you hear that?

309
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,000
What?

310
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,400
God, there are still people 
who have trouble with an interracial couple.

311
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,100
Interracial? 
Us?

312
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,200
Isn't that unbelievable?

313
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,500
Yes, it's awful!

314
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,400
They're upset because 
we're an interracial couple.

315
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,000
That is racism!

316
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,200
I don't feel like eating.

317
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:11,200
Me neither. 
Well, maybe this turkey club.

318
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,500
So... here I am.

319
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,300
Ready to take you to the Hamptons.

320
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,600
Sounds grand.

321
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,800
Do you have your bathing suits?

322
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,600
It's March.

323
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,600
Speak now, or we are 
headed to the Hamptons. 

324
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,900
It's a two-hour drive.

325
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:35,900
Once you get in that car, 
we are going all the way... 

326
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:40,900
to the Hamptons. 

327
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,100
All right, you wanna get nuts? 
Come on. 

328
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:50,100
Let's get nuts!

329
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,300
Hey, Dad.

330
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:56,300
You know you can program this thing 
to beep every time you need to take a vitamin.

331
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,100
Dad, you look so different.

332
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,900
Oh, no. 
We're campaigning, Jerry. 

333
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,900
To rule the people, 
one must walk among them.

334
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,300
This is the home stretch. 
Tomorrow's the election!

335
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,000
Right. Yeah. 

336
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
The polls close after dinner, 
3 o'clock. 

337
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,600
But then when we win, 

338
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,600
the celebration goes all night 
until the break of 8pm.

339
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,700
You know, you can put that whole schedule 
right in your daily planner.

340
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,100
Daily what?

341
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,400
Have you read 
today's Boca Breeze?

342
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,500
Hey, look at that. 
Picture of me, huh?

343
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,500
Candidate Cosmo Kramer 
caught barefoot in clubhouse.

344
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,600
Barefoot in the clubhouse?
Kramer!

345
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,800
Don't you realize 
this is against the rules?

346
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,500
Well, I couldn't find my shoes.

347
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,000
Kramer, these people 
work and wait their whole lives 

348
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,100
to move down here, 
sit in the heat, 

349
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,600
pretend it's not hot, 
and enforce these rules.

350
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,800
Who wants hot chocolate?

351
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,200
Oh, yeah! 
Me.

352
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,700
This is a huge scandal! 
We need damage control.

353
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,100
All right, look. 

354
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,200
People seem to like 
those tip calculators, huh?

355
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,000
Wizards!

356
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,400
Yeah, well, how 'bout if we give one out 
to every member on the condo board.

357
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,000
Kramer...

358
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,800
There are twenty people on the board.

359
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,400
Thank God you can get that deal.

360
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,700
Payoffs. 
Now we're playing politics. 

361
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,100
All right, 
what do we do next, Morty, huh? 

362
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,200
Wiretaps, slush funds?

363
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,900
First, I need a nap.

364
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:17,900
Oh, I'll get your electric blanket!

365
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,500
Kramer, I can't get that many Wizards.

366
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,400
Well, what about your deal, huh?

367
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,600
I didn't have a deal! 

368
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,400
They're two hundred dollars a pop.
What do I do?

369
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,000
Well, don't worry about it. 
I know a guy.

370
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,700
Down here?

371
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:30,700
Yeah, Bob Saccamano's father.

372
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,700
And that leads 
into the master bedroom.

373
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,400
Tell us more.

374
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,200
You want to hear more? 

375
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,400
The master bedroom 
opens into the solarium.

376
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,800
Another solarium?

377
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,500
Yes, two solariums. 
Quite a find. 

378
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,000
And I have horses, too.

379
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
What are their names?

380
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,600
Snoopy and Prickly Pete. 

381
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,900
Should I keep driving?

382
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,200
Oh, look, an antique stand. 

383
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,200
Pull over. 
We'll buy you a housewarming gift.

384
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,800
Housewarming gift.

385
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,800
All right, 
we're taking it up a notch!

386
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Here you go.

387
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,800
Long day?

388
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,600
Yeah, I just worked a triple shift.

389
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,800
I hear ya, Sister.

390
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,200
Sister?
- Yeah. 

391
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,900
It's OK. 
My boyfriend's black.

392
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,100
Here he is. 
See?

393
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,100
Hi, Elaine.
- Hey.

394
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,200
He's black?

395
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,300
Yeah.

396
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,000
I'm black?

397
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Aren't you?

398
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I'll give you a couple minutes 
to decide.

399
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,500
What are you talking about?

400
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,400
You're black. 
You said we were an interracial couple.

401
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,400
We are. 
Because you're Hispanic.

402
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,400
I am?

403
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,300
Aren't you?

404
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,400
No. 
Why would you think that?

405
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,800
Your name's Benes. 
Your hair.

406
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,700
And you kept taking me 
to those Spanish restaurants.

407
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,900
That's because 
I thought you were black.

408
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,500
Why would you take me to a 
Spanish restaurant because I'm black?

409
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,200
I don't think we should 
be talking about this.

410
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,100
So, what are you?

411
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,400
I'm white.

412
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,400
So, we're just a 
couple of white people?

413
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,000
I guess.

414
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,500
Oh.

415
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,200
Yeah. 

416
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,400
So do you want to go to the Gap?

417
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,400
Sure.

418
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,400
Oh, well...

419
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,000
I handed out all the Wizards. 

420
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,500
Polls close in one hour. 

421
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,800
I think we've got this baby 
all sewn up, huh? 

422
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,400
Oh, uh, there was an extra one. 

423
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,400
Norman Burgerman, he won't be 
leaving any tips where he is.

424
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,900
Congratulations, Mr. President.

425
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,700
Congratulations, Mr. Puppetmaster.

426
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,900
Hey, Morty, what's wrong with 
these tip calculators?

427
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,200
What are you talking about?

428
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,600
It's overtipping. 
I just left five bucks for a BLT.

429
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,700
Let me see that.

430
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,500
This isn't a Wizard, 
it's a Willard.

431
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,200
A Willard? 
Saccamano senior screwed me!

432
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,700
Mine doesn't have a seven!

433
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,100
I'm ruined!

434
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,200
Jerry, why didn't you get them Wizards?

435
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,900
Because a real Wizard's $200!

436
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,900
You didn't have a deal?

437
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,900
No deal. 
Not hot.

438
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:14,400
Morty, you, and Kramer, 
you're finished.

439
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:14,900
What?

440
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,500
Everyone vote for 
the guy in the wheelchair!

441
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,400
Let's go!

442
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,200
The people have spoken. 

443
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,200
Well, that's it for me. 
I'm heading back to New York.

444
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,300
Dad, I'm sorry.

445
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,500
You should be! 

446
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,300
How could you spend $200 
on a tip calculator?

447
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:37,300
It does other things!

448
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,100
Where are we, George?

449
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,200
Almost there.

450
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,600
Well, this is the end of Long Island.

451
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,200
Where's your house?

452
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,600
We, uh, we go on foot from here.

453
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,600
All right.

454
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,100
There's no house! 

455
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,400
It's a lie! 

456
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,400
There's no solarium. 
There's no Prickly Pete. 

457
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,600
There's no other solarium.

458
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,200
We know.

459
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,600
Then, why? 

460
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,200
Why did you make me drive 
all the way out here? 

461
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,200
Why didn't you say something? 

462
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,800
Why? Why? Why?

463
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,800
We don't like you, George.

464
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:42,100
And we always blamed you 
for what happened to Susan.

465
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,100
Oh.

466
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:50,100
All right! 
Let's head back.
