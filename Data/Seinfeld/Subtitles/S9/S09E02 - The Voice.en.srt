1
00:00:02,714 --> 00:00:05,126
George, you’re not really
handicapped, are you?

2
00:00:06,038 --> 00:00:07,728
I’ve had my difficulties.

3
00:00:09,158 --> 00:00:10,942
I saw you running down
Amsterdam Avenue

4
00:00:11,165 --> 00:00:14,740
lifting that 200 pound motorized cart
with one hand.

5
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,470
Mr. Thomassoulo during times
of great stress,

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,358
people are capable of
super human strength.

7
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:23,766
Have you ever seen the Incredible Hulk, sir?
- No.

8
00:00:24,286 --> 00:00:26,406
How about the old Spider Man
live action show?

9
00:00:27,621 --> 00:00:30,477
George, I’ve realized we’ve signed
a one-year contract with you,

10
00:00:30,576 --> 00:00:33,582
but at this point I think it’s best
that we both go our separate ways.

11
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:35,965
I don’t understand.

12
00:00:36,206 --> 00:00:40,669
We don’t like you. We want you to leave.
Clearer

13
00:00:43,966 --> 00:00:45,565
So you’re staying at Play Now?

14
00:00:45,701 --> 00:00:47,589
Why not? Pay is good.

15
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,480
I got dental, private access to one

16
00:00:49,481 --> 00:00:51,923
of the great handicapped
toilets in the city.

17
00:00:52,669 --> 00:00:54,277
But they not you aren’t handicapped,
aren’t you ashamed?

18
00:00:54,396 --> 00:00:56,910
They’re the ones who
should be ashamed.

19
00:00:57,037 --> 00:00:58,541
They signed me to
a one-year contract.

20
00:00:58,989 --> 00:01:02,374
As long as I show up for work
every day, they have to pay me.

21
00:01:03,133 --> 00:01:06,005
Hey
Hello-o-o-o!

22
00:01:06,181 --> 00:01:07,525
Hello-o-o-o Elaine!
What’s that?

23
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,636
Oh, it’s just this stupid thing.

24
00:01:09,846 --> 00:01:13,606
Well, I’m sure it’s stupid.
It’s not about me, is it?

25
00:01:14,176 --> 00:01:16,253
No-o-o-o.
Not at all.

26
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,423
Tell me!
All right.

27
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,291
You know this girl Clare I am seeing?
Yeah.

28
00:01:20,292 --> 00:01:21,998
Well, he and I starting joking that when

29
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,790
she falls asleep her stomach stays awake

30
00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:26,333
all night and talks to me.
- How is it talking?

31
00:01:26,404 --> 00:01:33,374
Well, her belly button is like a mouth.
"I’m bored. Talk to me."

32
00:01:33,444 --> 00:01:36,424
Oh, I gotta start taking these "stupid"
warnings more seriously.

33
00:01:37,391 --> 00:01:39,108
Hey, look whose here - Puddy.

34
00:01:39,589 --> 00:01:41,252
My Puddy?
But we broke up.

35
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,287
And yet he continues
to live.

36
00:01:44,996 --> 00:01:47,179
Hey Benes,
How are you?

37
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,443
I’m doing great.

38
00:01:48,499 --> 00:01:51,093
Great.
See ya.

39
00:01:51,568 --> 00:01:54,475
Well, that’s it.
You two are back together.

40
00:01:54,779 --> 00:01:55,708
What?

41
00:01:55,724 --> 00:01:58,843
The bump into. The bump into
always leads to the backslide.

42
00:01:58,876 --> 00:02:02,107
David and I will not be getting
back together.

43
00:02:02,635 --> 00:02:05,403
Elaine, breaking up is like knocking
over a coke machine.

44
00:02:05,524 --> 00:02:09,475
You can’t do it in one push, you got
to rock it back   and forth a few times,

45
00:02:09,724 --> 00:02:12,100
and then it goes over.
That’s beautiful.

46
00:02:13,642 --> 00:02:15,018
What about you?

47
00:02:15,019 --> 00:02:17,043
ou were even engaged, and
you cut  it off just like that.

48
00:02:17,187 --> 00:02:18,530
That’s different.

49
00:02:18,531 --> 00:02:22,404
I didn’t have feelings for those people.
But you, you’ll backslide

50
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:23,954
You want to bet?
Stakes?

51
00:02:25,635 --> 00:02:27,235
All right. Witness?
Witness.

52
00:02:27,418 --> 00:02:28,611
Done.
Percentage?

53
00:02:28,963 --> 00:02:30,075
No.

54
00:02:33,546 --> 00:02:35,041
So I’ll call you tonight?
Yeah.

55
00:02:35,426 --> 00:02:36,386
What’s wrong with
the belt?

56
00:02:36,387 --> 00:02:37,915
I went to the movies last night,

57
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:40,523
I went to the bathroom and
I unbuckled a little wobbly

58
00:02:40,914 --> 00:02:42,576
wobbly and the buckle kind of banged

59
00:02:42,577 --> 00:02:44,745
against the side of the
urinal. So...that’s it!

60
00:02:45,881 --> 00:02:48,252
So, you’re insane?
Oh yes, quite.

61
00:02:49,147 --> 00:02:51,988
Hello!
Of course it’s a sliding scale.

62
00:02:52,309 --> 00:02:56,937
Catch you later.
Hello-o-o-o!

63
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:00,067
La la la.
La la la.

64
00:03:01,339 --> 00:03:04,048
Look at this, they are redoing
the Cloud Club.

65
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:05,832
Oh, that restaurant on top
of the Chrysler building?

66
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,128
Yeah, that’s a good idea.

67
00:03:07,471 --> 00:03:09,063
Of course it’s a good idea,
it’s my idea.

68
00:03:09,207 --> 00:03:11,376
I conceived this whole project
two years ago.

69
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,175
Which part?

70
00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:15,266
The renovating the
restaurant you don’t own

71
00:03:15,267 --> 00:03:17,126
part or spending the two hundred million

72
00:03:17,127 --> 00:03:18,593
you don’t have part?

73
00:03:18,855 --> 00:03:20,383
You see I come up with
these things,

74
00:03:20,607 --> 00:03:22,519
I know they’re gold, but nothing
happens. You know why?

75
00:03:22,688 --> 00:03:25,423
No resources, no skill, no talent,
no ability, no brains.

76
00:03:25,445 --> 00:03:29,168
No, no...time! It’s all this
meaningless time.

77
00:03:29,264 --> 00:03:31,493
Laundry, grocery, shopping,
coming in here talking to you.

78
00:03:32,183 --> 00:03:35,287
Do you have any idea how much time
I waste in this apartment?

79
00:03:37,766 --> 00:03:39,206
I can ball park it.

80
00:03:41,143 --> 00:03:42,983
Hello-o-o-o!

81
00:03:43,158 --> 00:03:44,510
Here we go; now she
comes in.

82
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,367
Now my whole day is shot!

83
00:03:47,476 --> 00:03:49,166
Hey, I called you last night,
where were you?

84
00:03:49,494 --> 00:03:51,754
I went out with a friend.

85
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:55,767
George?
No, no...no.

86
00:03:56,038 --> 00:03:57,795
Well, I was here,
that’s everyone

87
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,799
Are those the same shoes
as yesterday?

88
00:04:07,078 --> 00:04:10,135
Oh, you know I wear these
shoes all the time.

89
00:04:10,143 --> 00:04:12,781
Your hair, it’s somewhat
de-poofed.

90
00:04:14,126 --> 00:04:16,701
It’s the new look.
You know Heroin Cheek?

91
00:04:21,253 --> 00:04:23,937
Wait a second,
what’s going on here?

92
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,814
Nothing, nothing.

93
00:04:27,021 --> 00:04:31,021
You’re wearing the same clothes
as yesterday!!! You saw Puddy!

94
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,180
Hoochie moochie.

95
00:04:34,229 --> 00:04:35,493
Hand it over. Pay up.

96
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:40,030
No! It’s an isolated, sexual incident.
We are not back together!

97
00:04:40,093 --> 00:04:41,621
Then what do you call it?

98
00:04:41,709 --> 00:04:43,302
People don’t just bump into
each other and have sex.

99
00:04:43,364 --> 00:04:44,597
This isn’t cinemax.

100
00:04:45,557 --> 00:04:47,147
It was no big deal OK?

101
00:04:47,292 --> 00:04:50,005
I mean we fooled around, then we went
out and grabbed a little dinner.

102
00:04:50,413 --> 00:04:53,662
Ah, dinner! That’s it, you’re
all the way back!

103
00:04:54,164 --> 00:04:57,772
Sex, that’s meaningless, I can understand
that, but dinner; that’s heavy.

104
00:04:57,813 --> 00:04:59,536
That’s like an hour.

105
00:05:00,012 --> 00:05:05,541
Man, 2.9 percent financing on a Toyota
Onedun . That was my idea too!

106
00:05:09,292 --> 00:05:11,198
Good Morning!
Go to hell!

107
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,539
Hi Allison, that’s a
nice dress

108
00:05:13,627 --> 00:05:14,699
Don’t even look at me.

109
00:05:15,403 --> 00:05:17,555
Hey Glenn!
Hey, go tell hell!

110
00:05:18,442 --> 00:05:19,778
Heard that one already.

111
00:05:23,314 --> 00:05:25,706
...So that’s the bedroom.
Here’s the bathroom.

112
00:05:26,843 --> 00:05:28,787
If you need to, you can familiarize
yourself with the kitchen...

113
00:05:29,314 --> 00:05:31,203
Yeah, go ahead and look through
some of the drawers.

114
00:05:33,442 --> 00:05:34,762
And you are?

115
00:05:35,137 --> 00:05:37,780
Oh, hey, I’m Darren.
I’m new here

116
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:41,370
Yeah, that’s Jerry, you don’t have
to worry about him.

117
00:05:41,747 --> 00:05:44,170
Why don’t you go across the hall
and get started on that mail.

118
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:48,475
Right!
He’s a go getter!

119
00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:51,865
Who’s he?
My intern from NYU.

120
00:05:52,907 --> 00:05:56,722
Well, you remember my corporation,
Kramerica Industries.

121
00:05:57,194 --> 00:05:58,642
Alright.

122
00:05:58,778 --> 00:06:01,826
Well, apparently NYU is very enthusiastic
about their students getting

123
00:06:01,988 --> 00:06:04,722
some real world corporate experience.

124
00:06:04,834 --> 00:06:07,961
But you only provide fantasy
world corporate experience.

125
00:06:08,128 --> 00:06:10,354
Well, this will really
free up my time

126
00:06:10,626 --> 00:06:13,195
so I can focus on more important
things, like my bladder system.

127
00:06:13,657 --> 00:06:15,052
Alright, it’s time to go.

128
00:06:15,336 --> 00:06:17,585
Jerry, it’s not for people,
it’s for oil tankers.

129
00:06:17,624 --> 00:06:18,286
I know!

130
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:21,670
You see the idea is for a rubber ball
inside the tanker so if it crashes,

131
00:06:22,023 --> 00:06:25,736
the oil won’t spill out.
Actually, that is not a bad idea.

132
00:06:25,814 --> 00:06:28,086
yeah!
Now, it’s time to go.

133
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:33,847
Hello
Hello-o-o-o.

134
00:06:35,678 --> 00:06:40,007
Seize montality, Jerry.
They really want me out of here.

135
00:06:40,198 --> 00:06:42,703
They’ve downgraded me to
some sort of a bunker.

136
00:06:42,799 --> 00:06:44,662
I’m like Hitler’s last days here.

137
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,198
So, are you going to leave?

138
00:06:46,254 --> 00:06:47,846
Oh no! I’m vigilant.

139
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,854
They’ll never get me out.
I’m like a weed, Jerry.

140
00:06:50,855 --> 00:06:52,495
I thought you’re like Hitler
in the bunker?

141
00:06:52,926 --> 00:06:54,702
I’m a weed in Hitler’s bunker.

142
00:06:55,486 --> 00:06:57,870
I’m getting a little uncomfortable
with the Hitler stuff.

143
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,398
I’m getting another call,
see ya... Hello!

144
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,645
Hi, this is Darren
from Kramer’s office.

145
00:07:02,834 --> 00:07:07,286
Mr. Kramer would like to schedule
a lunch with you at Monk’s coffee shop.

146
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:10,394
Really? When?

147
00:07:10,603 --> 00:07:14,156
In 10 minutes. Do you need directions?
No, I don’t.

148
00:07:14,317 --> 00:07:16,190
Well, I’ll call back in 5 minutes
to confirm.

149
00:07:16,191 --> 00:07:17,096
Yeah, 5.

150
00:07:18,061 --> 00:07:20,365
Hey!
Hey! So, where’s my money?

151
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:23,972
No money, I am Puddy free.
So, are we eating or what?

152
00:07:23,973 --> 00:07:25,100
Oh yeah, hold on.

153
00:07:27,191 --> 00:07:29,069
Hello Darren, this is Jerry
from Jerry’s office.

154
00:07:29,707 --> 00:07:31,610
We’re going to be three
for lunch.

155
00:07:35,651 --> 00:07:37,842
Hey, Elaine is going to come
with us, alright?

156
00:07:37,878 --> 00:07:39,758
What? When did this happen?
Well, just...

157
00:07:39,934 --> 00:07:42,058
DARREN!

158
00:07:45,294 --> 00:07:50,582
I am not calling Puddy.
What did I do with my gloves?

159
00:07:51,982 --> 00:07:54,150
Oh, I bet I left them over at Puddy’s.

160
00:07:54,495 --> 00:07:59,992
I should call him. I need those gloves.
No, I better not. I’ll call.

161
00:08:01,729 --> 00:08:05,910
Oh, look at that! There are the gloves.
I was just about to call.

162
00:08:06,213 --> 00:08:07,870
There they are. That’s funny.

163
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:11,591
That’s really funny.
That’s really really funny.

164
00:08:12,646 --> 00:08:15,086
You know who loves
funny stories, David Puddy.

165
00:08:17,087 --> 00:08:18,757
Well, Play Now is through playing.

166
00:08:18,758 --> 00:08:20,767
They turned the heat
way up in my office.

167
00:08:21,313 --> 00:08:22,992
They tried to sweat me out.

168
00:08:22,993 --> 00:08:25,510
Do you have to write
all this stuff down.

169
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,158
Well, Mr. Kramer is in a meeting with

170
00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:28,919
Mr. Lohmase and he didn’t
want to miss anything.

171
00:08:31,663 --> 00:08:32,983
So, how hot did it get?

172
00:08:33,398 --> 00:08:35,336
I don’t know, 120, 130...

173
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:39,215
Then they sent some guys
to sandblast for 6 hours.

174
00:08:39,734 --> 00:08:42,230
Tomorrow they are putting
in asbestos.

175
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,727
I guess you can take anything,
but actual work.

176
00:08:44,728 --> 00:08:46,128
Bring it on!

177
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:49,550
Hello-o-o-o Kramer!
Wel-l-l-c-o-m-e!

178
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,501
Sorry I couldn’t get out of there,
what did I miss?

179
00:08:54,237 --> 00:08:56,207
Well, after ordering, Mr. Seinfeld
and Mr. Costanza

180
00:08:56,448 --> 00:08:59,493
debated on whether or not iron
man wore some sort under garment

181
00:08:59,797 --> 00:09:01,541
between his skin and his iron suit...
Uh huh...

182
00:09:01,701 --> 00:09:02,988
And I still say he’s
naked under there!

183
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:05,357
Oh that makes a lot of sense.
Oh, shut up!

184
00:09:05,614 --> 00:09:07,268
...Then Mr. Seinfeld went
to the restroom,

185
00:09:07,628 --> 00:09:09,552
at which point Mr. Costanza scooped ice

186
00:09:09,553 --> 00:09:11,969
out of Mr. Seinfeld’s
drink with his bare hands

187
00:09:12,097 --> 00:09:15,477
using it to wash up  then Mr. Costanza

188
00:09:15,478 --> 00:09:19,034
remarked to me, "This never happened."

189
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,103
What’s so funny?
Oh, nothing.

190
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,744
What are you laughing about?
Tell me.

191
00:09:33,848 --> 00:09:36,895
Oh all right, this is really dumb,
really stupid.

192
00:09:38,376 --> 00:09:41,416
We’ve been doing this silly,
dumb voice.

193
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:45,361
So is it fun humiliating me?
No, it’s not you.

194
00:09:45,687 --> 00:09:50,375
It’s your stomach, he’s taking with
this funny, booming, jovial voice.

195
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,776
Hello-o-o-o.
So you think I’m fat?

196
00:09:54,096 --> 00:09:54,169
No it’s...

197
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,047
Mr. Kramer says, "hey buddy!"

198
00:09:56,048 --> 00:09:57,418
Hey, we’re kind of in the middle
of something here.

199
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:58,895
Would you mind coming
back later?

200
00:09:58,896 --> 00:10:01,143
Oh yeah sure, sure. Should we set
something up now?

201
00:10:01,664 --> 00:10:04,194
GET OUT!
I’m leaving too.

202
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:08,864
No body said you’re fat. He’s a loving
character, like the Kool-ade guy.

203
00:10:09,095 --> 00:10:10,559
He is fat!

204
00:10:10,914 --> 00:10:12,759
No, he’s just a little bloated.

205
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:16,073
Good-bye!
It’s mostly water weight.

206
00:10:16,915 --> 00:10:19,064
Boysenberry, the kid is still learning.

207
00:10:19,144 --> 00:10:21,516
Mr. Kramer...Dean, my internship
is on line two,

208
00:10:21,557 --> 00:10:23,093
she wants to set up a meeting.

209
00:10:23,173 --> 00:10:25,590
Yeah, well nothing before noon.
Line two?

210
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,580
Yeah, your phone is line one.

211
00:10:29,022 --> 00:10:29,735
Oh...

212
00:10:30,837 --> 00:10:34,608
So the gloves were right by
the phone. That is pretty funny.

213
00:10:35,174 --> 00:10:37,369
See, this is what Jerry’s
doesn’t understand.

214
00:10:38,151 --> 00:10:40,168
We can see each other.
We can see each other every day,

215
00:10:40,189 --> 00:10:41,429
but it doesn’t mean we
are back together.

216
00:10:41,822 --> 00:10:44,189
I mean I love just seeing you
and having sex

217
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:49,157
Not having to do all that...
you know...work.

218
00:10:49,293 --> 00:10:50,613
Well, either way...

219
00:10:50,614 --> 00:10:52,893
All that calling you,
and buying you stuff...

220
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,148
David...

221
00:10:54,149 --> 00:10:57,009
Caring about how everyone at work
isn’t as smart as you. It’s brutal.

222
00:10:58,188 --> 00:11:01,140
Alright that’s it!
We’re back together!

223
00:11:01,381 --> 00:11:02,886
Oh, no.
Oh, yeah.

224
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,835
Look Elaine, be reasonable.

225
00:11:06,131 --> 00:11:07,233
Get those clothes off.

226
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:08,687
You’re going to spend the night
and we’re going to cuddle.

227
00:11:08,857 --> 00:11:11,114
What?
You heard me. Strip!

228
00:11:25,009 --> 00:11:28,896
Alright......OK....

229
00:11:50,156 --> 00:11:53,656
Hello Margery, George Costanza.
How are you sweet heart?

230
00:11:54,009 --> 00:11:56,647
Listen, can you give Mr. Thomassoulo
a message for me? ...

231
00:11:57,201 --> 00:12:02,767
Yes. If he needs me, tell him
I’M IN MY OFFICE! Thanks.

232
00:12:04,848 --> 00:12:06,902
Dean Jones, you wanting
to talk to me?

233
00:12:07,007 --> 00:12:09,587
I’ve been reviewing Darren’s
internship journal. Doing laundry...

234
00:12:09,999 --> 00:12:11,473
...Yeah.

235
00:12:11,905 --> 00:12:17,394
...Mending chicken wire, hi-tea
with a Mr. Newman.

236
00:12:17,545 --> 00:12:19,138
I know it sounds pretty glamorous,

237
00:12:19,193 --> 00:12:21,498
but it’s business as usual
at Kramerica.

238
00:12:22,466 --> 00:12:26,944
As far as I can tell your entire enterprise
is more than a solitary man

239
00:12:26,945 --> 00:12:29,769
with a messy apartment which
may or may not contain a chicken.

240
00:12:32,167 --> 00:12:36,053
And with Darren’s help,
we’ll get that chicken.

241
00:12:36,167 --> 00:12:39,668
I’m sorry, but we can’t allow
Darren to continue working with you.

242
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:43,732
Well, I have to say this seems
capricious and arbitrary.

243
00:12:43,859 --> 00:12:45,878
You fly is open.

244
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,780
So you’re sure you’re not still
angry about last night?

245
00:12:50,077 --> 00:12:51,077
No, I’m fine.

246
00:12:51,077 --> 00:12:53,646
Just as long as you don’t ever
do that voice again.

247
00:12:53,967 --> 00:12:55,488
Never?
Never.

248
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,460
What about if you’re not around?
No!

249
00:12:57,638 --> 00:13:00,309
So I have to choose between
seeing you and doing the voice?

250
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,733
That’s right.
I can do that.

251
00:13:01,788 --> 00:13:03,427
So what’s your decision?
I don’t know.

252
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:34,489
Jerry...HI.

253
00:13:35,827 --> 00:13:39,636
Hello-o-o-o. La-la-la.

254
00:13:42,548 --> 00:13:44,427
You broke up with her?
Why?

255
00:13:44,887 --> 00:13:46,767
So we could do the voice.

256
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,819
La-la-la. What’s the matter?

257
00:13:51,396 --> 00:13:53,300
I think I’m getting tired of it.

258
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:56,426
I mean is that all it does?
Hello? La-la-la?

259
00:13:56,427 --> 00:13:58,007
No, it can do anything.

260
00:13:58,008 --> 00:14:02,919
It can be Spanish.
Hola. Hello-o-o-o.

261
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,417
I think I like the girl better
than the voice.

262
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:06,512
Really?

263
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,728
Hello-o-o-o.

264
00:14:08,991 --> 00:14:10,689
Still?
I told you.

265
00:14:11,423 --> 00:14:13,927
Alright, here you go,
choke on it

266
00:14:13,928 --> 00:14:16,136
See, never bet against the backslide.

267
00:14:16,144 --> 00:14:17,798
I knew you two would
get back together.

268
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:20,272
Yeah, well not for long.
I’m breaking up with him.

269
00:14:20,273 --> 00:14:22,709
No, I don’t think so.
I’ve seen you two together.

270
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:25,263
You make each other miserable.
It’s kismet.

271
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:27,033
Double or nothing.
Done.

272
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:29,856
Witness?
You’re in there again.

273
00:14:29,938 --> 00:14:32,608
I think Play Now is putting
something in my food.

274
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,560
Alright, I’m out of here.

275
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,837
What is this?
I don’t know.

276
00:14:38,838 --> 00:14:41,135
I found them in your closet.

277
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:46,039
Ever since Darren left I haven’t been
able to find anything.

278
00:14:46,231 --> 00:14:48,735
He took all my clothes
to some cleaners.

279
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:53,055
I’m clueless.
Is that clock right?

280
00:14:53,055 --> 00:14:54,318
Yeah. Nine o’clock.

281
00:14:54,319 --> 00:14:57,621
I was supposed to pick up Newman
at the zoo twelve hours ago.

282
00:14:57,623 --> 00:15:00,440
Good-bye Kramer.

283
00:15:00,495 --> 00:15:01,326
Jerry, buddy, I got to
tell you something.

284
00:15:01,327 --> 00:15:03,968
That voice is played.
Really?

285
00:15:04,398 --> 00:15:09,350
So played.
I told you.

286
00:15:17,129 --> 00:15:20,829
Darren? What are you doing here?
The college canceled the internship.

287
00:15:21,012 --> 00:15:24,332
I don’t care about the internship.
I care about Kramerica.

288
00:15:25,437 --> 00:15:26,868
Kramerica is no more.

289
00:15:26,869 --> 00:15:28,796
What about the oil tanker bladder system?

290
00:15:28,965 --> 00:15:31,277
We were going to put an
end to maritime oil spills.

291
00:15:32,236 --> 00:15:36,309
Probably. Darren, you go home.
Forget about Kramerica.

292
00:15:41,069 --> 00:15:43,795
Well, you’re still here?
I haven’t had time to leave.

293
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,980
Well, I haven’t changed my mind.

294
00:15:49,341 --> 00:15:51,799
Well, you are a tenacious little monkey.

295
00:15:51,828 --> 00:15:56,702
Alright, I’ll do it. Kramerica industries lives!
Let’s get back to work!

296
00:15:58,276 --> 00:16:00,357
Let’s see what Jerry
has to eat.

297
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,396
You win George. We’ve had it.

298
00:16:05,404 --> 00:16:10,293
If you leave right now, Play Now will give you
six months pay.

299
00:16:10,452 --> 00:16:15,587
That’s half of your entire contract.
Please...just go.

300
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:20,947
You see if I stay the whole year,
I get it all.

301
00:16:21,012 --> 00:16:23,611
Want to play hand ball huh? Fine.

302
00:16:24,687 --> 00:16:27,676
Attention Play Now employees, George

303
00:16:27,677 --> 00:16:31,412
Costanza’s handicapped
bathroom is now open

304
00:16:31,836 --> 00:16:35,268
on the sixteenth floor
to all employees and their families.

305
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,691
Well played.
I’ll see you in hell Costanza.

306
00:16:38,692 --> 00:16:40,092
Clare thanks for giving me
a second chance.

307
00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:49,494
Our relationship is certainly worth more
than some silly, stupid voice.

308
00:16:49,729 --> 00:16:51,848
Hold on one second. So
we definitely don’t want

309
00:16:51,849 --> 00:16:52,951
to do the voice anymore?

310
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:55,934
Alright, we’re back together again,
great. Bye bye.

311
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:03,629
Hey.
Trouble down at the plant?

312
00:17:04,687 --> 00:17:05,807
It’s a tank of oil.

313
00:17:06,221 --> 00:17:08,798
Darren and I are finally going
to test out my bladder system.

314
00:17:08,889 --> 00:17:10,373
You have to drink
that whole thing?

315
00:17:11,358 --> 00:17:13,502
No. No. No. It’s for oil tankers.

316
00:17:13,855 --> 00:17:16,783
All I need to do is fill some sort
of rubber container with oil

317
00:17:16,821 --> 00:17:19,829
and then drop it to see whether
or not it can restrain the impact.

318
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:24,638
I understand
Would a giant rubber ball work?

319
00:17:25,598 --> 00:17:27,133
Conceivably.

320
00:17:27,174 --> 00:17:30,287
Well, Play Now has all kinds
of different rubber balls.

321
00:17:30,369 --> 00:17:33,406
Why don’t we test your
bladder system at my office?

322
00:17:33,407 --> 00:17:34,253
You’re not...

323
00:17:34,508 --> 00:17:38,136
Oh, yes I am. Mr. Thomassoulo
likes to play dirty.

324
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:43,306
Well, there’s nothing dirtier
than a giant ball of oil.

325
00:17:44,088 --> 00:17:49,130
Hey, you want to split a root beer
I don’t think so David, we’re through.

326
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:52,527
Oh...That’s a nice sweater

327
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,436
Whew that was a dozy.

328
00:18:02,947 --> 00:18:04,213
Go again?
Book it.

329
00:18:04,408 --> 00:18:05,428
Witness.

330
00:18:06,756 --> 00:18:10,048
David I know this hurts,
but it’s the way it has to be

331
00:18:12,356 --> 00:18:15,077
Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha.

332
00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:21,251
I’m going to get some popcorn.

333
00:18:22,862 --> 00:18:24,750
So, how did it end?

334
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,719
They got away.
uh.

335
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:31,430
Listen David, I’ve got to run.
Can you lend me fifty bucks?

336
00:18:35,569 --> 00:18:38,128
Hey.
Did you bring the video camera?

337
00:18:38,608 --> 00:18:40,230
Yeah, I put a six hour tape in.

338
00:18:40,261 --> 00:18:43,013
That should cover the experiment,
the arrest,and most of your trial.

339
00:18:44,021 --> 00:18:45,381
Alright, I’ll see ya.

340
00:18:45,461 --> 00:18:47,222
Oh, you might want
to stick around Jerry.

341
00:18:47,229 --> 00:18:49,398
Mr. Thomassoulo picked the wrong man

342
00:18:49,399 --> 00:18:51,928
to hire because he was fake handicapped.

343
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:56,253
I can’t. I got to meet Clare.
You gave up the voice?

344
00:18:56,477 --> 00:18:59,127
Yeah, I thought it was stupid.
Unless you guys are liking it again.

345
00:18:59,691 --> 00:19:00,368
No. No

346
00:19:00,369 --> 00:19:02,309
Darren?
Sorry Mr. Seinfeld.

347
00:19:02,388 --> 00:19:05,188
Uh, bathroom.
Hey, use mine. I’ll let you in.

348
00:19:05,569 --> 00:19:09,453
I thought it was open to the public.
I uh, took care of that.

349
00:19:17,069 --> 00:19:24,517
Wow! Zanadu . No wonder you’re putting
in so many hours. May I?

350
00:19:25,092 --> 00:19:30,291
I insist. I’ll fix us a drink.
I got it.

351
00:19:32,948 --> 00:19:34,460
Whew. You know Darren,

352
00:19:34,468 --> 00:19:37,059
if you would have told me
twenty-five years ago that some day

353
00:19:37,293 --> 00:19:40,245
I’d be standing here about to solve
the worlds energy problems,

354
00:19:40,397 --> 00:19:44,326
I would’ve said you’re
crazy... Now let’s push

355
00:19:44,327 --> 00:19:47,732
this giant ball of oil out the window.

356
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:51,968
So, check out my view.

357
00:19:53,116 --> 00:19:56,610
Wow! Hey, there’s Clare.
I better go down.

358
00:19:56,956 --> 00:19:58,908
Hey, there’s Kramer & Darren.

359
00:19:59,355 --> 00:20:05,004
There’s the giant ball of oil.
Clare’s right underneath that thing.

360
00:20:05,051 --> 00:20:11,787
Clare! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o!
Hello-o-o-o!

361
00:20:12,107 --> 00:20:15,243
I don’t believe this.
I am not looking up

362
00:20:15,244 --> 00:20:17,781
if you’re going to do that voice.

363
00:20:17,782 --> 00:20:24,703
Bombs away
This is going to be a shame.

364
00:20:28,194 --> 00:20:32,175
Hello.
Well, that didn’t work.

365
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:38,294
Hey, how about this...ketchup and mustard
in the same bottle?

366
00:20:38,318 --> 00:20:40,691
Oh that sounds interesting sir.
Yeah.

367
00:20:48,797 --> 00:20:51,571
Clare won her lawsuit against Play Now.

368
00:20:51,572 --> 00:20:54,488
Gee, Play Now is filing for bankruptcy.

369
00:20:54,781 --> 00:20:56,050
I guess you’re not going in anymore.
No

370
00:20:56,659 --> 00:20:57,794
So they’re not paying you your...
No.

371
00:20:58,034 --> 00:20:59,186
So you’re pretty much...
Yeah.

372
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,722
What ever happened to Darren?

373
00:21:03,769 --> 00:21:06,442
Darren is going away for a long
long time.

374
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:12,466
So Clare sure looked real funny
covered in oil like that...

375
00:21:12,577 --> 00:21:17,058
Hello-o-o-o I got beamed with
a giant ball of oil...

376
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:21,265
I’m slippery as an eel...
La la la.

377
00:21:22,706 --> 00:21:24,609
I’m just so glad it’s back.

378
00:21:26,915 --> 00:21:30,336
See, this is good. This is the way
it should be.

379
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:34,339
You know why are we fooling ourselves.
We belong together.

380
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:37,128
I want to break up.
Ah nuts!
