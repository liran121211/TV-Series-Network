1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
It seems like whenever these office people 
call you in for a meeting, 

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,200
the whole thing is about the sitting down.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,900
I would really like to sit down with you.

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,900
I think we need to sit down and talk.

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,700
Why don't you come in, and we'll sit down.

6
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,400
Well, sometimes the sitting down doesn't work.

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,300
People get mad at the sitting.

8
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,700
You know, we've been sitting here 
for I don't know how long.

9
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,000
How much longer are we just going to sit here?

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,800
I'll tell you what I think we should do.

11
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,200
I think we should all sleep on it.

12
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,100
Maybe we're not getting down low enough.

13
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:33,100
Maybe if we all lie down, 
then our brains will work.

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,600
I can't eat this without ketchup.

15
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,200
Would it kill her to check up on us?

16
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,500
Would that be a terrible thing?

17
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,000
"How's everything?"

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,700
"Do you need anything?"

19
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,100
"What can I do for you?"

20
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,400
I know what you mean.
- Do you?

21
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,600
It's like going out with someone 
and you never hear from them again.

22
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,500
Same thing!

23
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,800
Not really, but it's something.

24
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,700
Ask the people behind you.

25
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,900
Excuse me.

26
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,300
Are you using your ketchup?

27
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:03,800
What do you think?

28
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,500
You want to give him the ketchup?

29
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,700
It's up to you.

30
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,300
You know what?
 I don't think so.

31
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:14,300
I'm going to need it from time to time.

32
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,000
So what are you doing later?
You want to go to the movies?

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,400
Nah - what for?

34
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,200
To see a movie.

35
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,400
I've been to the movies.

36
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,600
Not this movie.

37
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,800
They're all the same.

38
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,600
You go, you sit, 
you eat popcorn, you watch.

39
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,300
I'm sick of it.

40
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,400
Did you shower today?

41
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,400
Yeah.

42
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,000
That's usually the kind of mood 
I'm in when I haven't showered.

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,600
When is it going to be my turn, Jerry?

44
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,100
When do I get my 15 minutes?

45
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,600
I want my 15 minutes!

46
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,500
Oh, quit complaining.

47
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,300
At least you have your health.

48
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,500
Ah! Health's not good enough.

49
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,200
I want more than health.

50
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,500
Health's not doing it for me anymore.

51
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,800
I'm sick of health.

52
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,200
All right, we're done.
You can have it now.

53
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,200
Oh, very gracious.

54
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,600
Nice day.

55
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,500
Yeah.

56
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,200
What is that?

57
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,500
Hey! JoJo!

58
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,200
Hey, hey!

59
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,700
All right, 
thanks for the ride, Kramer.

60
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,400
No, thank you.

61
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,100
So what are you doing?

62
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:15,900
Nothing.

63
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,100
Come on, let's go to the beach.

64
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,100
What, are you crazy?

65
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,500
What? It's a beautiful day.

66
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,600
Have a good time.

67
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,800
Yeah, there's something in the air today.

68
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,700
You feel it?

69
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,100
There's something in the air.

70
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,800
You know you're turning into Burt Lancaster?

71
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,800
Yeah, there's something in the air.

72
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:36,100
Oh, I forgot to call Jill.

73
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,500
Jill.
Hi, it's Elaine.

74
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,700
How is your father?

75
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,700
Is everything okay?

76
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,300
What?

77
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,800
I can't hear you so good.
There's a lot of static.

78
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,400
Wha--?

79
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,800
I'm going to call you back.

80
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,200
Jill's father is in the hospital 

81
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,600
and you call to ask about him 
on a cell phone?

82
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,600
What? No good?

83
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,600
Faux pas.

84
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,300
Faux pas?

85
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,500
Big hefty stinking faux pas.

86
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:00,900
Why?

87
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,000
You can't make a health inquiry 
on a cellphone.

88
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,600
It's like saying,

89
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,700
"I don't want to take up 
any of my important time in my home, 

90
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,300
so I'll just get it out of the way 
on the street."

91
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:12,000
And the street cellphone call 
is the lowest phone call you can make.

92
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,300
It's an act of total disregard.
It's selfish.

93
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:14,900
It's dismissive.

94
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,100
It's pompous.

95
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:20,100
Why don't you think 
before you do something?

96
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,200
Here's a thought--

97
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,900
Bye bye.

98
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,900
Too much?

99
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,200
Boy, I'm really surprised at Elaine. 

100
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,200
That whole phone business. 
She should know better than that.

101
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,600
Hey - hey - hey!

102
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,300
What?

103
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:47,300
Where do you think this relationship is?

104
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,400
If you are thinking of instituting 
an open-door urination policy, 

105
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,500
let me disabuse you of that notion 
right now, my friend.

106
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,000
You're so uptight.

107
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,700
Uptight? 
Let's all just have a big pee party.

108
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,300
Hey everybody, grab a bucket.

109
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,300
We're going up to Jerry's.

110
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:07,300
It's a pee party.

111
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,200
<i>Jerry, this is Elizabeth Clark calling 
from James Kimbrough's office at NBC.

112
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,500
<i>Could you please give us a call?

113
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,500
<i>Thanks.

114
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:22,900
Hello? 

115
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,900
Yeah, hi, this is Jerry Seinfeld 
calling for James Kimbrough.

116
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,400
Hello?

117
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,700
Hi.

118
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,000
Uh huh--

119
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,800
Really?

120
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,100
Uh, no problem.

121
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,700
Definitely.

122
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,100
OK.

123
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,000
Bye-bye.

124
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,700
That was James Kimbrough.

125
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,500
Who's he?

126
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,600
He is the new president of NBC.

127
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,400
He wants to sit down with us
and talk about "Jerry".

128
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,500
Our show, "Jerry"?

129
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,900
Right.

130
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,900
"Jerry", oh my God.

131
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,000
He wants to talk about "Jerry"?

132
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,600
Yeah!

133
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,100
When?

134
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,300
Today, like right now.

135
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,700
Right now?

136
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,300
"Jerry"?

137
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:58,700
"Jerry"!

138
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,000
He wants to talk about "Jerry"?

139
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,200
He wants to talk about "Jerry"!

140
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,600
"Jerry"!

141
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,700
Can I go like this?

142
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,400
Sure!

143
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,900
No sports jacket?
I don't need a sports jacket?

144
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,000
Writers wear sports jackets.

145
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Forget the sports jacket.

146
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,800
I won't feel like a writer.

147
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,700
You're not a writer.

148
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,700
Right!

149
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,400
Water.

150
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,400
Need some water!

151
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,200
Water here!

152
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,200
OK, now listen.

153
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,200
I don't want any scenes in here 
like the last time.

154
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,800
Don't worry, don't worry, 
no scenes.

155
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,600
Don't blow this.

156
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,700
I will not blow this.

157
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,200
If he says he doesn't want it to be 
a show about nothing, don't go nuts.

158
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,600
It's fine, 
it doesn't have to be about nothing.

159
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,700
He might not want nothing.

160
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,600
Something, nothing, I could care less.

161
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,500
He might want a show 
about anything and everything.

162
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,200
Anything, everything, something, nothing -
Who the hell cares?

163
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,000
Put me down.
I'm down!

164
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,800
All right.

165
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,700
Mr. Kimbrough is ready to see you.

166
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,600
Magic time.

167
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,700
What?

168
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,000
Mr. Kimbrough.

169
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,400
Hey, Jerry, good to see you.

170
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,800
Hey, hey, hey!
- How you been?

171
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,100
Good, good.
You remember George.

172
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,100
George, good to see you.

173
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,100
Hello Stu.

174
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,500
You remember Jay Crespi.

175
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,100
Jay Crespi!
How am I gonna forget Jay Crespi?

176
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,400
This is James Kimbrough.

177
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,900
Nice to meet you, pleasure, 
thanks for coming in.

178
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,900
Kimbrough.

179
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,500
Don't spell.

180
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,200
K-I-M-B-R-O-U-G-H

181
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:17,900
That's right.

182
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,900
It's a talent I have.

183
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,700
Why don't we sit down.
Glad you're here.

184
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:26,200
Some day out there.
You ever see weather like that?

185
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,600
It's crisp.
It's crispy crisp.

186
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,200
Shut up, George.

187
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,500
Can I get you anything?

188
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,800
What do we have in the fruit department?

189
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,000
Oy.

190
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,200
Pineapple.

191
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,800
Oh, that's a dangerous fruit.

192
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,100
It's like a weapon, that thing.
Got spikes on the end.

193
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,800
You can get killed 
from one of those things.

194
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,100
Anyway, let me tell you why I called.

195
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,500
When I took over here last month, 

196
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,900
I reviewed what was in development,

197
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,900
and it was pretty much 
same old, same old.

198
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,500
Been there, done that.

199
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,200
Right.

200
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,700
I was looking for something different.

201
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,100
Something that would have people 
talking at the water coolers.

202
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,000
Water coolers?

203
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,900
We call it a water-cooler show.

204
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,200
Because the next day in the offices, 

205
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,200
people gather around the water coolers 
to talk about it, right?

206
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,700
See, I think people would talk about it 
at the coffee machines.

207
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,700
It's probably just easier to say 
"water cooler show" than "coffee machine show".

208
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,600
It's really not accurate.

209
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,400
Nobody drinks from a water cooler 
anymore - they use bottles.

210
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,800
But I think Mr. Kimbrough makes a good point.

211
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,600
Anyway, Stu here started telling me 

212
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,800
about a show, "Jerry", 
that he developed five years ago.

213
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,100
I have always loved it.

214
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,800
He said it was a show about nothing.

215
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,500
So, I saw the pilot,

216
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,400
and I've got to tell you - 
I flipped out.

217
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,000
He totally flipped out.

218
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,700
What I want to do is 
put it on the air.

219
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,500
13-episode commitment.

220
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,800
Start it off on Wednesday night, 
build an audience.

221
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,300
This show needs time to grow.

222
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,700
I love that Kramer guy.

223
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,800
He's a little off the wall.

224
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,000
Oh yeah.

225
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,500
Kramer.

226
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,600
And Elaine -

227
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,100
I wouldn't mind seeing 
something happening between you two.

228
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,200
Definitely.

229
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,000
I tell you, 

230
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I really don't think so-called relationship humor 
is what this show is all about.

231
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,000
Or we could not do the show 
altogether, how about that?

232
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Or we could get them together.

233
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:16,100
Yeah!
- Yeah!

234
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,700
Jill, hi, it's Elaine.

235
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,800
Well, I'm calling from my home.

236
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,900
Indoors.

237
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:32,900
Well, I was just calling 
to see how your fa...

238
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,200
I'm sorry, I'm getting another call.

239
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,300
Hang on just a second.

240
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,200
Hello?

241
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,500
Hi. Elaine, it's me.

242
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,700
Jerry, I'm on the other line.

243
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,200
No, no, this is an emergency. 
Get off the phone.

244
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,900
I'm sorry, Jill.

245
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,400
I'm going to have to take this call.

246
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,200
Jerry, what's the emergency?

247
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,300
The "Jerry"'s back on - the TV show!

248
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,700
George and I are moving to California!

249
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,300
That's the emergency?

250
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,800
Did you hear what I said?

251
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,700
I was on the other line 
talking to Jill.

252
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,800
Jill?

253
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,300
Well, why didn't you say so?

254
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,300
You said it was an emergency.

255
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,700
So now she's lost a phone face-off?

256
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:10,700
That's even worse than your 
cell phone walk-and-talk.

257
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,000
Congratulations, 
they're doing the show.

258
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,300
They should have put that show on 
five years ago.

259
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,600
Bunch of idiots at that network.

260
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,100
Can I tell you something, Jerry?

261
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,000
It's all crap on TV.

262
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,900
The only thing I watch is 
"Xena the Warrior Princess".

263
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,600
She must be about six-six.

264
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,200
She's not six-six.

265
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,500
Jerry, you ever watch that?

266
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,800
Yeah, it's pretty good.

267
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,900
They picked up the show?

268
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,600
I'm moving to California.

269
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,300
Oh baby-doll, 
this kid's going places, I told you.

270
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,100
The NBC guy liked it?

271
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,300
Of course he liked it.

272
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,500
He told you he liked it?

273
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,600
He wouldn't put it on 
if he didn't like it.

274
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,400
Well, what are you doing?

275
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,900
I'm writing.

276
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,100
You know how to write?

277
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,500
Without the writing, you have nothing.

278
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,300
You're the ones that make them look good.

279
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,800
Since when do you know how to write?

280
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,800
I never saw you write anything.

281
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,000
Ma?

282
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,800
I don't know how you're gonna 
write all those shows.

283
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,900
And where are you gonna get all the ideas?

284
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,300
Would you leave him alone?

285
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,000
You'll shatter his confidence!

286
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I don't need any ideas.

287
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's a show about nothing.

288
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Nothing. Please.

289
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'll tell you the truth -
the whole thing sounds pretty stupid to me.

290
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,800
NBC is letting me use their private jet?

291
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,300
And I can go anywhere I want?

292
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,700
That's fantastic!

293
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,900
Thanks.

294
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,900
Great.
Okay, bye.

295
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,100
Oh hey!

296
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,100
Hey - how was the beach?

297
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,700
Oh, you missed it, buddy.

298
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:37,300
Lot of femininas - some major femininas.

299
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:41,300
I had a little meeting today at NBC.

300
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,100
What are you doing?

301
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,000
You know, I went swimming and 
I can't get this water out of my ear.

302
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,600
So do you remember five years ago, 
we did that pilot, "Jerry"?

303
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,100
Well, the new guy at NBC wants to do it.

304
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,300
They're putting it on the air!

305
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,000
They're giving us a 13-episode commitment.

306
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,400
George and I are moving to California!

307
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,300
You're moving to California?

308
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,900
Yeah, but only for a while.

309
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,600
Yeah, but Jerry, 
what happens if the show's a hit?

310
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,100
You could be out there for years!

311
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,200
You might never come back.

312
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,300
No, I'll be back.

313
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,100
Jerry.

314
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,100
It's L.A.

315
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,800
Nobody leaves.

316
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,800
She's a seductress, she's a siren, 
she's a virgin, she's a whore.

317
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,900
And my agent said, as a bonus 
I can use their private jet. 

318
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,900
So we'll all go somewhere. 
The four of us. 

319
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,600
One big fling before 
George and I go to California.

320
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,600
Fling!

321
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,200
So we can go anywhere we want?

322
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,500
Anywhere.

323
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,900
Why are they doing this?

324
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,000
I think they want to make it up to us,

325
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,900
cause they let this thing 
sit on their shelf for five years.

326
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,900
This is all very exciting.

327
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,800
So? Where are we going?

328
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,400
I say Japan.

329
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,200
Why Japan?

330
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,500
Oh - geishas.
They cater to your every whim.

331
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,000
They're shy at first, but they're 
quite skilled at conversation.

332
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,500
They can discuss anything from 
world affairs to the fine art of fishing.

333
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,800
Or baking.

334
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,000
Oh! I got it. 
How about Russia?

335
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,100
Russia, it's so bleak.

336
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,300
It's not bleak. 
It's springtime.

337
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,700
It's still bleak.

338
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,300
You can't be bleak in spring.

339
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,900
You can be bleak in spring.

340
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,900
If you're bleak, you're bleak.

341
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,000
What about Switzerland?

342
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,900
Oh - Switzerland - 
the Von Trapp family, huh?

343
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:30,000
It's a bit hilly - no?

344
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You're not going to do any walking.

345
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,500
What if I want to walk around a little?

346
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,500
So then you'll walk down the hill 
and we'll pick you up.

347
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,800
What if I'm at the bottom?

348
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,100
All right! You know what, just forget it!

349
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,600
Alright - come on - come on now, people.

350
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,100
Let's face it, we're not all 
going to agree on anything.

351
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,100
Why don't we all just go to Paris?

352
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,700
I'll go to Paris.

353
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,500
Me too.

354
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,500
Oh yeah - oui oui.

355
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:05,300
So that's it. It's settled. 
We're going to Paris.

356
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:10,100
Yeah!

357
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,600
Hey.

358
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,600
NBC limo is downstairs.

359
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,000
I'm just going to call Jill 
one more time before we go.

360
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,600
Wait, you can't make a call like that 
on your way out.

361
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,700
You can't rush that conversation.

362
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,500
Well, I can't call from the limo.

363
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,600
Can I call from the plane?

364
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,200
First you make a cell-phone walk-and-talk, 

365
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,000
then she loses a call-waiting face-off, 

366
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,800
now you're talking about a plane call?

367
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,800
All right, I'll just have to 
call her from Paris.

368
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,200
Hello, Jerry.

369
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,600
Hello, Newman.

370
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,600
What gives?

371
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,200
I was speaking earlier with Kramer,

372
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,900
and he mentioned something 
about a private jet to Paris?

373
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,100
Yeah, that's right.

374
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,200
Well, I hear it's quite beautiful there 
this time of year, 

375
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,700
and of course you know 
I'm one-quarter French.

376
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,500
Really.

377
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,900
Oh yes, in fact 
I still have family there.

378
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,500
This probably won't interest you, 

379
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,500
but I have a cousin there 
who's suffering very badly.

380
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,900
She's lost all use of her muscles.

381
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,600
She can only communicate by blinking.

382
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,500
I would so love to see her.

383
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,700
Bring a ray of sunshine 
into her tragic life.

384
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,500
But alas, I can't afford it, 

385
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,500
for I am, as you know,
but a simple postal worker.

386
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,800
That's a shame.

387
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,200
Take me! Take me!

388
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,000
Oh, forget it.

389
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,200
Pull yourself together.

390
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,200
You're making me sick.

391
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,400
Be a man!

392
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,600
All right!

393
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,100
But hear me and hear me well.

394
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,700
The day will come.

395
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:43,700
Oh yes. Mark my words, Seinfeld. 
Your day of reckoning is coming.

396
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,700
When an evil wind will blow 
through your little playworld

397
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,300
and wipe that smug smile 
off your face.

398
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,300
And I'll be there, 
in all my glory, watching - 

399
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,800
watching as it all comes crumbling down.

400
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,800
Ah, Jerry?
- Yeah.

401
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,500
I'm Captain Maddox. 
This is my co-pilot, Kurt Adams.

402
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,700
Ready to go to Paris?

403
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,800
All set.

404
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,900
We'll just grab the bags.

405
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,900
Don't worry about that.

406
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,200
We'll take care of them for you.

407
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,200
Just keeps on getting better and better.

408
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,200
Not bad.

409
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,700
Wow!

410
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,900
The only way to fly.

411
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,900
This is it?

412
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:44,500
I'm sorry.

413
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,000
I have to say, I'm a little disappointed.

414
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I thought it would be a lot nicer.

415
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,400
You're complaining about a private jet?

416
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,600
You think this is the plane 
that Ted Danson gets?

417
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,400
Ted Danson is not even on the network anymore.

418
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,500
Still, I bet when they gave him a plane, 
it was a lot nicer than this one.

419
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,000
Will you shut up?

420
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,100
You are ruining the whole trip.

421
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,800
This is a real piece of junk.

422
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,700
I don't even feel safe on this thing.

423
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,000
I have a good mind to 
write a letter to Mr. Kimbrough.

424
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,800
You're not writing any letters!

425
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,300
Would you turn around?

426
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,100
Why?

427
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,700
You are annoying me sitting like that.

428
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,300
It's effeminate.

429
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,000
It's effeminate to sit like this?

430
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,600
Yes, I think it's a little effeminate.

431
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,200
How is this effeminate?

432
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:31,200
I don't know - it just is.

433
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,000
Kramer, what are you doing?

434
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,200
Still got water in your ear?

435
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,400
Can't get rid of it.

436
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,800
Maybe it leaked inside my brain.

437
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,400
Would you stop that?

438
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,500
It's not safe to be 
jumping up and down on a plane.

439
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,800
I got to get it out, 
I can't take this anymore.

440
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,000
Kramer, don't be fooling around up here.

441
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,200
Kramer!

442
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,600
Hey, get the hell out of here!

443
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,800
What is that?

444
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,800
Oh my God!

445
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,300
What is that noise?
What is that noise?

446
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,300
Kramer, what the hell did you do?

447
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,600
I lost my balance.

448
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,100
Oh my God!

449
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,000
What's going on?

450
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Kramer!

451
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,200
It was an accident.

452
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,500
I told you to stop with the hopping.

453
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,900
Oh my God, we're going down.

454
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,800
We're going to die!

455
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,200
Just when I was doing great.

456
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,700
I told you 
God wouldn't let me be successful.

457
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,800
Is this it?

458
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,400
Is this how it ends?

459
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,500
It can't!

460
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,500
It can't end like this!

461
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,600
I'm ready! I'm ready!

462
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,000
Glory hallelujah!

463
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,400
Jerry?

464
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,400
Jerry, can you hear me?

465
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,500
Yeah.

466
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,900
There's something I have to tell you.

467
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,100
What? What is it?

468
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,600
I cheated in the contest.

469
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,300
What?
- What?

470
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,700
The contest - I cheated.

471
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,400
Why?

472
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,100
Because I'm a cheater!

473
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,500
I had to tell you.

474
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,900
Great - I won.

475
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:53,600
Jerry, I gotta tell you something too.

476
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,400
Yeah, Elaine, I got something 
I want to say to you.

477
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,300
No no - me first.

478
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,900
Alright.

479
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,900
Jerry, I've always ...

480
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,200
Hey - What's going on?

481
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,500
We're straightening out!

482
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,400
We're straightening out?

483
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,800
We're straightening out!
- We're straightening out!

484
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,800
Yeah!

485
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,000
Well, again, 
sorry about that little mishap.

486
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,700
But once you get everything checked out, 
there shouldn't be anymore problems.

487
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,700
Where are we?

488
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,100
Latham, Massachusetts.

489
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,100
Why don't you take a cab into town, 
get yourself something to eat.

490
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,600
I got your beeper number - 
I'll beep you as soon as we're ready.

491
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,800
Okay.
Yeah, okay.

492
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,800
We'll see you later.

493
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,100
Well, what are we going to do about Paris?

494
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,600
I mean, are we actually 
going to get back on this plane?

495
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,700
I say we go back to New York, 
and take a regular flight.

496
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,800
I'm not getting on a regular plane now.

497
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,700
I'm all psyched up to go on a private jet.

498
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,900
No way I'm getting on a regular plane.

499
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,700
Well, I'm sure that they 
would fly us first class.

500
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,200
First class doesn't make it anymore.

501
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,400
Now you get on the phone with Kimbrough, 

502
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,600
tell him what happened and tell him 
to get another plane down here, 

503
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,500
but this time, the good one - 
the Ted Danson plane.

504
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,800
Alright, I'll feel him out.

505
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,900
Yeah, just tell him to hurry it up.

506
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,700
Nice day.

507
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,500
Another one?

508
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,200
Alright fatso, out of the car.

509
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,200
I want to capture this.

510
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,200
Come on! 

511
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:27,700
Gimme your wallet.

512
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,700
Don't shoot.

513
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,100
Well, there goes the money for the lipo.

514
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,200
See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy 
is, it's an easy getaway.

515
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,700
You know? 
They can't really chase ya!

516
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,300
He's actually doing him a favor.

517
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,400
It's less money for him to buy food.

518
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,400
I want your wallet.

519
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,100
Come on. Come on, come on.

520
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,200
That's a shame.

521
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,700
Alright, I'm gonna call NBC.

522
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,900
Officer, he's stealing my car!

523
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,100
Officer, I was carjacked.

524
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,200
I was held up at gunpoint!

525
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,600
He took my wallet, everything!

526
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,200
Okay, thanks anyway.

527
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,700
They can't get another plane.

528
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,200
All right, what's wrong 
with the plane we got?

529
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,200
They're just checking it out.

530
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,900
Forget it.
- No, no, no.

531
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,700
We're not getting on there.

532
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,600
Come on, let's go get something to eat 
in Sticksville.

533
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,000
All right, hold it right there.

534
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
What?

535
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,900
You're under arrest.

536
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,600
Under arrest? What for?

537
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,000
Article 223-7 of the 
Latham County Penal Code.

538
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,800
What?

539
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,400
No, no - we didn't do anything.

540
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,800
That's exactly right.

541
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,300
The law requires you to 
help or assist anyone in danger 

542
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,500
as long as it's reasonable to do so.

543
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,900
I never heard of that.

544
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,700
It's new.

545
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:34,700
It's called the Good Samaritan Law.

546
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,700
Let's go.

547
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,300
The Good Samaritan Law?
Are they crazy?

548
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,300
Why would we want to help somebody?

549
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:44,900
I know.

550
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,800
That's what nuns and 
Red Cross workers are for.

551
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,800
The Samaritans were an ancient tribe. 
Very helpful to people.

552
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,800
Alright. 
Um, excuse me?

553
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,700
Hi, could you tell me 
what kind of law this is?

554
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,000
Well, they just passed it last year.

555
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,800
It's modeled after the French law.

556
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,700
I heard about it after 
Princess Diana was killed 

557
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,100
and all those photographers 
were just standing around.

558
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,500
Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

559
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,500
You're the first ones to be arrested on it, 
probably in the whole country.

560
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,300
All right, so what's the penalty here?

561
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,700
Let's pay the fine or something 
and get the hell out of here.

562
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,900
Well, it's not that easy.

563
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,800
See now, the law calls for 
a maximum fine of $85,000 

564
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,800
and as much as five years in prison.

565
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,000
What?

566
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,200
Oh no, no no no - 
we have to be in California next week.

567
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,900
We're starting a TV show.

568
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,500
California?

569
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,200
Oh gosh, I don't think so.

570
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,600
Yeah, my guess is 
you're gonna be prosecuted.

571
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,600
Better get yourselves a good lawyer.

572
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,600
Who told you to put the cheese on?

573
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,800
Did I tell you to put the cheese on?

574
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,500
I didn't tell you to put the cheese on.

575
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,700
Jerry Seinfeld on the phone.

576
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,900
You people with the cheese.

577
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,300
It never ends.

578
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:54,300
Hello?

579
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,000
Good Samaritan Law?

580
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,300
I never heard of it.

581
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,600
You don't have to help anybody.

582
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,100
That's what this country's all about.

583
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,500
That's deplorable, 
unfathomable, improbable.

584
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,900
Hold on.

585
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,300
Suzie, cancel my appointment 
with Dr. Bison.

586
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,000
And pack a bag for me.

587
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I want to get to 
Latham, Massachusetts right away.

588
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,000
So they got Jackie Chiles, huh?

589
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,100
Uh huh. 
You know what that means.

590
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:22,100
This whole place is going to be swarming 
with media by the time this thing is over.

591
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,700
You're not going to be able to 
find a hotel room in this town.

592
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,100
The whole country 
is going to be watching us.

593
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,700
Now we got to do 
whatever it takes to win it, 

594
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,300
no matter what the cost.

595
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:37,300
The big issue in this trial 
is going to be character.

596
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,400
I want you to find out 
everything you can about these people.

597
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,400
And I mean everything.

598
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,200
Mmmm, this is pretty good chow, huh?

599
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,800
Would it kill him to check up on us?

600
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,700
No - drops off the meals and that's it.

601
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,700
I realize we're prisoners, 
but we're still entitled to ketchup!

602
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,200
I guess we could've called for help.

603
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,600
But then we would have 
missed the whole thing.

604
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,600
I still had it on video.

605
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,300
We could have watched it later.

606
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,600
Yeah, he's right.

607
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,400
I forgot about the video.

608
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,200
Sure. Video.

609
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,200
What is that?

610
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,200
Plane's ready.
