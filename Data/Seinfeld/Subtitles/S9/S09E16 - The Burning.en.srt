1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,700
Alright, be careful with the car, babe.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:04,600
Yeah, yeah.

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,400
And don't move the seat, 
I got it right where I like it.

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,500
Goodbye?

5
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,300
Two and ten, babe.

6
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,200
Okay.

7
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,200
Don't peel out.

8
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,200
I won't.

9
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,400
<i>Jesus is one, Jesus is all, 
Jesus picks me up when I fall.</i>

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,000
<i>And he said unto Abraham...</i>

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,200
<i>Amen! Amen!</i>

12
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,000
<i>So we pray...</i>

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
<i>Saved!</i>

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,600
<i>Jey-sus!</i>

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,600
Jesus?

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,300
According to our latest quarterly... 
thing,

17
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:50,300
Kruger Industrial Smoothing is 
heading into the red. 

18
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,500
Or the black, 
or whatever the bad one is. 

19
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,600
Any thoughts?

20
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,600
Well, I know when I'm a little strapped, 

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,600
I sometimes drop off my rent check 
having "forgotten" to sign it. 

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That could buy us some time.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,100
Works for me. Good thinking, George.

24
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,900
Alright, George.
- Way to go man.

25
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,600
Or we don't even send the check,

26
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,600
and then when they call, we pretend we're the cleaning service. 

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
<i>"Hello? I sorry, no here Kruger."</i>

28
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,600
Are you done? 

29
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,600
Silly voices. 
Come on, people, let's get real.

30
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,900
Good one.

31
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,900
That was bad.

32
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,300
I had 'em, Jerry. They loved me.

33
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,200
And then?

34
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,100
I lost them. 

35
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,600
I can usually come up with one good comment 
during a meeting,

36
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,600
but by the end it's buried under 
a pile of gaffes and bad puns.

37
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,200
Showmanship, George. 

38
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,600
When you hit that high note, 
you say goodnight and walk off.

39
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,900
I can't just leave.

40
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,200
That's the way they do it in Vegas.

41
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,400
You never played Vegas.

42
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,400
I hear things.

43
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,800
Here's one.

44
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,300
I borrowed Puddy's car, 

45
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,300
and all the presets on his radio 
were Christian rock stations.

46
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,500
I like Christian rock. 

47
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,500
It's very positive. 

48
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,500
It's not like those real musicians 
who think they're so cool and hip.

49
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,100
So, you think that Puddy 
actually believes in something?

50
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,100
It's a used car, he probably 
never changed the presets.

51
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,800
Yes, he is lazy.

52
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,800
Plus he probably doesn't even know 
how to program the buttons.

53
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,200
Yes, he is dumb.

54
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,800
So you prefer dumb and lazy to religious?

55
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,300
Dumb and lazy, I understand.

56
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,400
Tell you how you could check.

57
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,200
How?

58
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,800
Reprogram all the buttons, 
see if he changes them back. 

59
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,500
You know? The old switcheroo.

60
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,900
No, no, the old switcheroo is:

61
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,900
You poison your drink, 
and then you switch it with the other person's.

62
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,000
No, it's doing the same thing 
to someone that they did to you.

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yeah, Elaine's gonna do the same thing 
to Puddy's radio that the radio did to her.

64
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,900
Well that's the gist of it!

65
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,400
Quiet! 

66
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,900
So where is this Sophie?

67
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,400
Oh, she's picking me up in a few minutes.

68
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,700
How long have you two been together?

69
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,200
I dunno. Since the last one. 

70
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,000
Oh, here she is. You wanna meet her?

71
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Nah.

72
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,700
By the way, how did Puddy 
get back in the picture?

73
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,700
I needed to move a bureau.

74
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,500
Hey Jerry, you got any pepper?

75
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,100
Hey Jerry.

76
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,100
Hey Mickey. Check the pepper shaker.

77
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:45,100
Yeah. 

78
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,200
See? It should sound like that, 
something like that.

79
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,900
A little wetter. 
See, I didn't believe it.

80
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,400
What's with the fake sneezing?

81
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,800
Yeah, we're going down to 
Mt. Sinai Hospital.

82
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,800
See, they hire actors 
to help the students practice diagnosing.

83
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,200
They assign you a specific disease, 
and you act out the symptoms. 

84
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,200
It's an easy gig.

85
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,900
Do medical schools actually do this?

86
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,800
Well the better ones. 

87
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,100
Alright, let's practice retching.

88
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,600
Ready?

89
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,900
I think the phone is ringing.

90
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,500
Would you hold it a second?! 

91
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,700
Thank you, will you get out of here 
with that stuff?

92
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:33,700
Mickey, DTs.

93
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,400
Hello?

94
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,600
Hey. It's me.

95
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,400
Elaine?

96
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,200
No, it's me.

97
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,700
George??

98
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,600
Jerry, it's Sophie. 

99
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,400
I can't believe 
you don't recognize my voice.

100
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,400
Oh, I knew it was you, I was joking. 

101
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,100
I'm a comedian.

102
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,700
You got any Ipecac?

103
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,000
Ipecac? 

104
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,100
Kramer, I really think you guys 
are going too far with this.

105
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,800
No, Mickey, he swallowed twelve aspirin.

106
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,000
Did he overdose?

107
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
No, it's just too much.

108
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,600
... And it gets worse. 

109
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,600
The team working on the statue in 
Lafayette Square kind of over-smoothed it. 

110
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:16,200
They ground the head down to 
about the size of a softball.

111
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,900
And that spells trouble.

112
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,200
Alright, well, why don't we 
smooth the head down to nothing, 

113
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,200
stick a pumpkin under its arm 
and change the nameplate to Ichabod Crane?

114
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,900
Alright! That's it for me. 
Goodnight everybody.

115
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,900
In your package you will find 
the disease you have been assigned 

116
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,800
and the symptoms you will need to exhibit.

117
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,800
Bacterial Meningitis. 
Jackpot!

118
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,800
Gonorrhea? 

119
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,200
You wanna trade?

120
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,900
Sorry, buddy, this is the Hamlet of diseases. 

121
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,900
Severe pain, nausea, delusions--
it's got everything.

122
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,600
How 'bout you, 
you wanna trade?

123
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,200
Sure.

124
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,200
Okay, what do you got?

125
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,200
The surgeon left a sponge inside me.

126
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,300
Good luck with that.

127
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,300
I knew I had hit my high note, 
so I thanked the crowd and I was gone.

128
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,700
What did you do the rest of the day?

129
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,300
I saw "Titanic". 

130
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:31,300
So that old woman--
she's just a liar, right?

131
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,800
And a bit of a tramp if you ask me.

132
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,100
Hello boys.
- Hey!

133
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,900
So did you give that radio 
the old switcheroo?

134
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,500
I did.

135
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,300
And the Christian rock?

136
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,600
Ressurected! 

137
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,300
And look what I pried off of his bumper...

138
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:51,100
A Jesus fish!

139
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,100
Jerry, do you have any fishsticks?

140
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,900
No. 

141
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,600
So you're disappointed 
that he's a spiritual person?

142
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,100
Well, yeah.

143
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,900
I got him because he 
seemed so one-dimensional. 

144
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,300
I feel misled.

145
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,800
I think it's neat. 

146
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,800
You don't hear that much 
about God anymore.

147
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,900
I hear things. 

148
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,400
Hey, so Sophie gave me the "It's me" 
on the phone today.

149
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,700
"It's me?" 
Isn't it a little premature?

150
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,800
I thought so.

151
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,300
She's not a "me". 
I'm a "me".

152
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,100
I'm against all "It's me"s. 

153
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,000
So self-absorbed and egotistical.

154
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's like those hip musicians 
with their complicated shoes!

155
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,600
Well--
I got gonorrhea.

156
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,700
That seems about right.

157
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,100
That's what they gave me.

158
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,000
They? 

159
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,100
The Government?

160
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,700
No, no. 

161
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:56,400
He's pretending he's got gonorrhea 
so med students can diagnose it.

162
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,200
And it's a waste of my talent. 

163
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,600
It's just a little burning. 

164
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,000
Mickey, he got bacterial meningitis.

165
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I guess there are no small diseases, 
only small actors.

166
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:14,200
Alright, that's it for me! 
Good night everybody.

167
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,600
What was that?

168
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,700
Showmanship. George is trying to 
get out on a high note.

169
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,000
See, showmanship. Maybe that's 
what my gonorrhea is missing.

170
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Yes! Step into that spotlight and 
belt that gonorrhea out to the back row.

171
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,100
Yes, yes I will! 

172
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:33,100
I'm gonna make people feel my gonorrhea, 
and feel the gonorrhea in themselves.

173
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,600
And are you experiencing any discomfort?

174
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,300
Just a little burning during urination.

175
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,000
Okay, any other pain?

176
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The haunting memories of lost love. 

177
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,200
May I? 

178
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,200
Lights? 

179
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,800
Our eyes met across the crowded hat store. 

180
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,900
I a customer, 
and she a coquettish haberdasher.

181
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,500
Oh, I pursued and she withdrew, 

182
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,200
and then she pursued and I withdrew, 

183
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,900
and so we danced. 

184
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,100
And I burned for her. 

185
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:27,100
Much like the burning during urination 
that I would experience soon afterwards.

186
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,300
Gonorrhea!

187
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:33,300
Gonorrhea!

188
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,400
One message. 
Hope it's not from you.

189
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,900
<i>Hey Jerry, it's me. 
Call me back.</i>

190
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,100
Sophie.

191
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,300
She's still doing that?

192
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,200
Yep.

193
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,800
Alright, I'll tell you what you do. 

194
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,200
You call her back 
and give her the "it's me", heh? 

195
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,400
Pull the old switcheroo.

196
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,400
I think that's a "what's good for 
the goose is good for the gander".

197
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,000
What the hell is a gander, anyway?

198
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It's a goose that's had 
the old switcheroo pulled on it. 

199
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,200
Hi Sophie, it's me.

200
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,700
Hey Rafe.

201
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,000
She thinks it's someone named Rafe.

202
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,800
Good, let her think it.

203
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,800
So, what's going on?

204
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,500
Not a lot.

205
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,000
Ask about you, 
ask about you.

206
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,600
So, uh, how are things with Jerry?

207
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,100
Oh, I really like him, but--

208
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,400
Well, I still haven't told him 
the tractor story.

209
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,000
Right, right, the tractor story.

210
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,900
Are you sick, Rafe? 
You sound kinda funny.

211
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:36,900
I sound funny?

212
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,400
Abort! Abort!

213
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,400
Yeah, I better get to a doctor, bye. 

214
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,900
That was close! 

215
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,000
What drives me to take chances like that?

216
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,400
That was very real.

217
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,200
She said there's some tractor story 
that she hasn't told me about.

218
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,200
Whoa, back it up, back it up. 
Beep, beep, beep. 

219
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,900
Tractor story?

220
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:04,900
Beep, beep, beep? 
What are you doing?

221
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,800
So where do you wanna eat?

222
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,300
Feels like an Arby's night.

223
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,300
Arby's. Beef and cheese and-- 

224
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,100
Do you believe in God?

225
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,200
Yes.

226
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,300
Oh. 

227
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,900
So, you're pretty religious?

228
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,700
That's right.

229
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,600
So is it a problem 
that I'm not really religious?

230
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,900
Not for me.

231
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,900
Why not?

232
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,900
I'm not the one going to hell.

233
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,100
You know what I think? 
I bet she stole a tractor.

234
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:52,100
No one's stealing a tractor. 
It's a five-mile-an-hour getaway. 

235
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,600
We're dancing around the obvious. 
It's gotta be disfigurement.

236
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,800
Does she walk around 
holding a pen she never seems to need?

237
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,800
No, she looks completely normal.

238
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,500
Oh. Okay, here it is, I got it. 

239
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,500
She lost her thumbs in a tractor accident 
and they grafted her big toes on. 

240
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,800
They do it every day.

241
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,900
You think she's got toes for thumbs?

242
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,900
How's her handshake? 

243
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:24,700
A little firm, isn't it? 
Maybe a little too firm?

244
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,900
I don't know.

245
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,100
Hands a little smelly?

246
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,100
Why do I seek your counsel?

247
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,500
Well, I'm going to hell.

248
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,100
That seems about right.

249
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,800
According to Puddy.

250
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,900
Hey, have you heard the one 
about the guy in hell,

251
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,100
with the coffee 
and the doughtnuts and--

252
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,700
I'm not in the mood.

253
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,000
I'll have some coffee and a doughnut.

254
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,700
What do you care? You don't believe in hell.

255
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,500
I know, but he does.

256
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,300
So it's more of a relationship problem 
than the final destination of your soul.

257
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,600
Well, relationships are 
very important to me.

258
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,200
Maybe you can strike one up 
with the prince of darkness 

259
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,200
as you burn for all eternity.

260
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:04,300
And a slice of Devil's fruitcake.

261
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,600
Hey. 

262
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,200
Where is everyone?

263
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,100
They're all off the project. 

264
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,700
They were boring. 

265
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,900
George, you are my main man.

266
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,000
I am?

267
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,900
I don't know what it is, 
I can't put my finger on it, 

268
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,500
but lately you have just seemed 'on'. 

269
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,500
And you always leave me wanting more.

270
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,400
This is a huge project 
involving--

271
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,100
lots of numbers and papers and folders.

272
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:42,100
Ah, I'm not too worried about it. 
Let's get started.

273
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,600
Okay.

274
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,600
George? Check it out. 

275
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,600
Three times around, no feet.

276
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,900
And?

277
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:55,900
All me.

278
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,000
Alright, and here are 
your ailments for this week. 

279
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
By the way, Mr. Kramer, 
you were excellent.

280
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,800
Oh, thank you.

281
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,100
Cirrhosis of the liver with jaundice! 

282
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,400
Alright, I get to wear make-up! 

283
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,700
What did you get?

284
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,900
Gonorrhea? 

285
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,200
Excuse me, I think there's been a mistake.
See, I had gonorrhea last week.

286
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,200
Oh, it's no mistake. 
We loved what you did with it.

287
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,400
I don't believe this. 
I'm being typecast!

288
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,000
I move my knight... 

289
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,700
here. 

290
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,900
Check.

291
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:34,900
They should update these pieces, 
nobody rides horses anymore. 

292
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,900
Maybe they should change it to a tractor.

293
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,700
Jerry, are you embarrassed 
that you're losing?

294
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,300
Losing? 

295
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:46,300
You know, yesterday I lost control of my car, 
almost bought the farm.

296
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,200
Bought the farm?

297
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,600
Tractor!

298
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,600
This is an odd side of you, Jerry. 
I feel uncomfortable.

299
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,500
Wait, don't go. 
Let's thumb wrestle.

300
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,500
A scar?

301
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:10,500
A big long scar, where her leg 
would dangle when she's riding a...?

302
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,800
A tractor.

303
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,200
I'm sure she's a little self-conscious 
and doesn't like to talk about it.

304
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,900
I don't see why's she more self-conscious 
about that than her toe thumbs.

305
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:21,500
She doesn't have toe thumbs.

306
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,100
Well, if she keeps 
horsing around with that tractor--

307
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,500
Alright. 

308
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,600
So how's the two-man operation at Kruger?

309
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,700
Two-man? It's all me. 

310
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,100
Kruger doesn't do anything.

311
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,700
Disappears for hours at a time, 
gives me fake excuses. 

312
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,500
This afternoon I found him 
with sleep creases on his face. 

313
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,000
The only reason I got out 
to get a bite today was 

314
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
that he finally promised to buckle down 
and do some actual work. 

315
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,600
Oh, I don't believe this.

316
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:53,900
This is what I 
have to put up with, Jerry. 

317
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,900
Mr. Kruger? 

318
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:59,800
Who said he was going to do 
some actual work today? Who?

319
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,100
I'm not too worried about it.

320
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,500
Well I am. 

321
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:07,300
Couldn't you try to go through 
some of that stuff I put in your shoebox?

322
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,300
Alright, alright, I'm going.

323
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,200
Have you ever seen anything like this?

324
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,200
Never.

325
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:24,300
Elaine, they forgot to 
deliver your paper today. 

326
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,300
Why don't you just grab that one.

327
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,800
'Cause that belongs to 
Mr. Potato Guy, that's his.

328
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,900
C'mon, get it.

329
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,700
Well if you want it, 
you get it.

330
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:37,700
Sorry, thou shalt not steal.

331
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,900
Oh, but it's ok for me?

332
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,300
What do you care. 
You know where you're going.

333
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,500
Alright, that is it! 
I can't live like this.

334
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,600
Nah.

335
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,200
C'mon.

336
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,400
Alright, what did I do?

337
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,400
David, I'm going to hell! 
The worst place in the world! 

338
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:59,300
With devils and those caves 
and the ragged clothing! 

339
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,300
And the heat! 
My God, the heat! 

340
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,600
What do you think about all that?

341
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,500
Gonna be rough.

342
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,000
You should be trying to save me!

343
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,400
Don't boss me!

344
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,600
This is why you're going to hell.

345
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,100
I am not going to hell.

346
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,800
And if you think I'm going to hell, 

347
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,800
you should care that I'm going to hell, 
even though I am not.

348
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,700
You stole my Jesus fish, didn't you?

349
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:25,700
Yeah, that's right!

350
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,000
Oh, my liver! 
Why did I drink all those years? 

351
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,900
Why did I look for love in a bottle?

352
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,900
Mr. Kramer? You're up.

353
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,200
Wait a minute. 
- What?

354
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,700
You are doing gonorrhea, aren't you?

355
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,500
Well, we'll see.

356
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,800
Student #2: So, what seems to be 
bothering you today, Mr. Kramer?

357
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,900
Well, I guess it started 
about twenty years ago 

358
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,900
when I got back from Viet Nam, 
and this was the only friend I had left.

359
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:03,700
Hey! That's my cirrhosis! He's stealing my cirrhosis! 

360
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:07,700
You wanna be sick? 
I'll make you sick.

361
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:11,700
Student #2: Cirrhosis of the liver and--
PCP addiction?

362
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,000
Let me see if I understand this. 

363
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,500
You're concerned that he 
isn't concerned that you're going to hell. 

364
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,200
And you feel that she's too bossy.

365
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,400
Yeah, that's right.

366
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,400
Well, oftentimes in cases of 
inter-faith marriages, couples have difficulty--

367
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,900
Woah, woah, woah! 
No one's getting married here.

368
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,500
You aren't?

369
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,700
No.

370
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,900
Oh.

371
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,900
We're just, you know, 
having a good time.

372
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,500
Oh.

373
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,400
Well, then it's simple. 
You're both going to hell.

374
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,400
No way. 
This is bogus, man!

375
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,400
Well, thank you, Father.

376
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,100
Oh, did you hear the one 
about the new guy in hell 

377
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,000
who's talkng to the devil 
by the coffee machine?

378
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,200
I'm really not in the mood. 
I'm going to hell.

379
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,200
Oh, lighten up. 
It'll only feel like an eternity.

380
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,100
You know, Jerry, there's this thing 
that I haven't told you about.

381
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:21,100
See, there was this tractor and--

382
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,300
Oh boy, this is really difficult.

383
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:29,300
Sophie, it's me. ,

384
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:33,900
I know about the tractor story 
and I'm fine with it.

385
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,200
How could you know?

386
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,100
It's not important. 

387
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,900
What's important is, I'm not gonna 
let a little thing like that 

388
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:48,900
ruin what could be a very long-term 
and meaningful relationship.

389
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,400
... I didn't say that, no.

390
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,400
You gave me gonorrhea, 
you didn't even tell me!

391
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,800
Well, I'm sorry. 

392
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,300
I gave you gonorrhea because 
I thought you'd have fun with it.

393
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,700
Hey, hey! 
I'm with someone.

394
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,700
Oh. 
Hello.

395
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:07,400
No, I understand. 
This could be a tough thing to deal with. 

396
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,400
The important thing is that 
you have a partner who's supportive.

397
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,300
You know? 
She's right.

398
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,200
Unfortunately, 
I didn't have a partner. 

399
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,700
I got gonorrhea from a tractor.

400
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,200
You got gonorrhea from a tractor?

401
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,600
And you call <i>that</i> the tractor story?

402
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,200
You can't get it from that.

403
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,000
But I did. 

404
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
My boyfriend said I got gonorrhea 
from riding the tractor in my bathing suit.

405
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,800
Alright, that's it for me. 

406
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,800
You've been great. 
Goodnight everybody.

407
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,000
Would you mind helping me out 
with some of this stuff?

408
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,800
You seem like you've got 
a pretty good handle on it.

409
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,500
No! I don't! 

410
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,100
Don't you even care? 

411
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,600
This is your company! 

412
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,400
It's your name 
on the outside of the building! 

413
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,100
Speaking of which--

414
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:16,000
the 'R' fell off 
and all it says now is K-uger!

415
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,900
K-Uger, that sounds like 
one of those old-time car horns, huh?

416
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,900
K-Uger! K-Uger!

417
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,600
You are too much, Mr. Kruger! 
Too much!

418
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,300
Thank you George, you've been great. 
That's it for me.

419
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,200
Oh no, you're not going out 
on a high note with me, Mr. Kruger!

420
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,100
It's K-Uger!

421
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,300
No! No!

422
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:41,300
Goodnight everybody!
