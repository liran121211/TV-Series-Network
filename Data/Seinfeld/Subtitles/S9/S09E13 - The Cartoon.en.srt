1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,000
So you're saying UNICEF is a scam?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It's the perfect cover 
for a money laundering operation. 

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
No one can keep track of all those kids 
with the little orange boxes of change.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,800
Oh no. It's Sally Weaver.

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,400
Your old college roommate, huh?

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,000
No, it's Susan Ross's old college roommate.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
She moved to New York a few years ago. 
She's trying to become an actress.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,600
Ah, dramatica comedia.

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,700
Untalented.

10
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,700
She's always inviting me to see her in some bad play
in a tiny room without ventilation.

11
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,400
It's really depressing.

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,400
We don't go to enough theater.

13
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,500
She should just give up.

14
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,700
Heeyyy!

15
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,900
Hey there, Mister 
"Too big to come to my shows"!

16
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,200
I just came from tap, 
I'm all "whooo"!

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,600
I'm on my way to an audition. 
Still looking for that big break.

18
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,400
Why don't you just give up?

19
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,700
Kramer!!!

20
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,700
Well, that's what Jerry says. 

21
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,100
Now face it. If it hasn't happened, 
it's not gonna happen.

22
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:59,100
All right, we go grab some bouffe. 
Join us?

23
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:06,900
So... 
Susan's dead...

24
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,800
I think she was happy 
someone finally said it.

25
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,000
Why did you have to say anything to her?

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,900
I felt the conversation was lagging.

27
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,500
Why can't you ever 
keep your big mouth shut?

28
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,800
I come in here to get a pleasant meal, 

29
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,800
and if we're not gonna have one, 
I'll grab a bite to eat at your place.

30
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,200
You know, maybe Kramer was right. 

31
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,300
Some people should just give up. 
I have.

32
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,600
What did you wanna be?

33
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,600
I don't remember. 
But it certainly wasn't this. 

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,400
Look at this cartoon in the New Yorker.
I don't get this.

35
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,400
Me neither.

36
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,300
And you're on the fringe 
of the humor business!

37
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,700
Hey!

38
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,400
Hey! George, look at this.

39
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,200
That's cute.

40
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,500
You got it?

41
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,000
No, never mind.

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Come on. We're two intelligent people here. 
We can figure this out. 

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,800
Now, we got a dog and a cat in an office.

44
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,800
It looks like my accountant's office 
but there's no pets working there.

45
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,500
And the cat is saying 
"I've enjoyed reading your email".

46
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,800
Maybe it's got something to do 
with that "42" in the corner.

47
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,100
It's a page number.

48
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,100
Well, I can't crack this one.

49
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,000
Aahh! This has got to be a mistake.

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Try shaking it.

51
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,000
Well, Janet should be here any minute.

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,900
You've been hiding her from us. 
You must really like her?

53
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,600
Oh, Jerry. The minute I saw this girl, 
we just clicked. 

54
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,200
She's got such a nice face. 

55
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,700
Her eyes, her mouth... 
nose...

56
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,800
We know what a face consists of.

57
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,900
I'm sorry I'm late.

58
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,800
Jerry, Elaine, I give you-- 
Janet.

59
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,500
Nice to meet you.

60
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,200
Hi.
- Hi.

61
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,300
Do we still have time to make the movie?

62
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:57,300
We just can't go to the supermarket 
to get some candy.

63
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,000
Jerry, she looks exactly like you.

64
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,300
She does not.

65
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:14,300
Well maybe she doesn't, I don't care.

66
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,700
Hey, Kramer.
- Hey. You got some messages.

67
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,400
George, George, Elaine, 
George again, Elaine.

68
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,700
Newman, but that was a crank call.

69
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,300
And some Sally woman called, 
says "Thanks a lot,

70
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,400
she's quitting the business, 
you ruined her life."

71
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,000
What? 
You're the one who ruined her life.

72
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,700
Well, that's not how she remembers it.

73
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,500
Well, I got to talk her out of this.

74
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,200
I thought you said she stinks.

75
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,600
She does stink. And she should quit. 

76
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,400
But I don't want it to be because of me. 

77
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,200
It should be the traditional route:
 
78
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,200
years of rejection and failure, until 
she's spit out the bottom of the porn industry.

79
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,200
Yeah...

80
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,800
Hey! George and Janet.

81
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,900
Oh! Who's Janet?

82
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,000
George's girlfriend.

83
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Elaine thinks she looks like me. 
But I think it's, as you would say, kookie talk.

84
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You know what woman I always thought 
you looked like? Leena Horne.

85
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,100
Hey, Hey!
- Hey, George.

86
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:17,100
And you must... look exactly like Jerry. 

87
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,900
You don't see this? You're like twins!

88
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,600
This is eerie!

89
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,900
Kramer, what are you talking about?

90
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,200
Janet doesn't look anything like Jerry.

91
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,700
Well, maybe we do 
look a little like each other.

92
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:33,700
No! What do you know about 
what you look like?

93
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,300
Come on, George, relax. 

94
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,300
Just because they look alike, that doesn't mean 
you're secretly in love with Jerry.

95
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,500
All right, we're going now. Bye-bye.

96
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,500
We just got here, George.

97
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,500
Well - it's getting dark.

98
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,700
She's a nice girl. 

99
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,600
Kinda quiet though.

100
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,700
What are you doing? 

101
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,000
Don't tell a woman she looks like a man!

102
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,200
And George doesn't want to hear 
his girlfriend looks like me.

103
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,200
Frankly, neither do I.

104
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,300
Well, how should I have 
broached the subject?

105
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,200
You don't "broach", 
you keep your mouth shut!

106
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,700
Well, sounds like 
someone's having a bad day.

107
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,300
Yeah. 
Because of you.

108
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,300
Well, then I think 
one of us should leave.

109
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,500
Sally, you can't quit the business. 

110
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,400
This is all because of me.

111
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,500
You can't give up. 

112
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,900
You don't think people tell me I stink?

113
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,700
When I'm on stage that's all I hear.

114
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,700
"You stink. You suck. 
We like magic."

115
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,400
Really?

116
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,700
Of course.

117
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,400
I stink, you stink. 

118
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,000
It's showbiz. Everybody stinks.

119
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Yeah! 
You've been stinking since the Eighties.

120
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,200
All right, I think 
we've covered my act. 

121
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,100
Now you get out there 
and stink it up with everybody else.

122
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,800
All right! Yes! 

123
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,800
Thank you! 
I'm gonna do it.

124
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,100
Now!

125
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:08,100
I've asked everyone at work, 
and no one gets this cartoon. 

126
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,300
I mean, I don't understand 
why no one can explain it, 

127
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,900
but I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.

128
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,600
Oh! I think we're at the bottom.

129
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,400
Hey, George.

130
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,500
Janet seems really nice. 

131
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,500
And she's quite a-- 
handsome woman.

132
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,200
What does that mean?

133
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
Yeah, what does that mean?

134
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,000
What do you mean by that?

135
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Enjoy.

136
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,800
Elaine, huh?

137
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,100
She's completely...
- Oh! I know.

138
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,900
Cause-- you don't think Janet...?
- No...

139
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,900
Why would I...

140
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,900
It's ludicrous..

141
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,100
Yes.

142
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,400
I mean, neither one of us..

143
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:46,900
No...

144
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:47,500
So...

145
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,600
Exactly.

146
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,600
I'm not gay.

147
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:58,200
... neither am I.

148
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,700
Kramer, get in here!
- Kramer!

149
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,300
Where's the crazy man? 
Come on up!

150
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,300
Come on in here.

151
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:11,700
What are you doing? 
Come and talk to us.

152
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,100
I've made an important life decision.

153
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,700
Let's talk about that.
- Don't leave.

154
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,400
All right. I--

155
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,300
I know I've been 
shooting off at the mouth lately.

156
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,200
First with that girl 
whose life you destroyed...

157
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,500
and then about 
George dating a lady Jerry.

158
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,800
What's the decision?

159
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,100
I know you want me to 
keep my big mouth shut. 

160
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,000
Well, that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

161
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,600
I'm never gonna talk again.

162
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,400
Yeah, right.

163
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,400
What do I need to talk for, huh?

164
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,400
What, the blab to the neighbors about how George has a new fem-Jerry friend?

165
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,400
Or to tell everybody at the coffee shop 
how George is all mixed up 

166
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,400
in a perverse sexual amalgam 
of some girl and his best friend?

167
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,700
See now, I've done all that.

168
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,700
Now it's time for silence.

169
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,300
Silence! Yes!

170
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,600
Kramer, you're never gonna be able 
to completely stop talking.

171
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,500
Jerry, 94% of communication is non-verbal. 

172
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,500
Here, watch.

173
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,100
What does this mean?

174
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,400
Well, it's Frank and Estelle's reaction 

175
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,600
of hearing about 
George's man-love towards she-Jerry.

176
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,300
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

177
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,000
That's the idea.

178
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,800
Kramer, there's no way you stick to this.

179
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,800
Oh! you're gonna start now?

180
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,800
That's right.

181
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,800
Right-- now.

182
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,900
Now!

183
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,400
So J. Peterman wants to 
hire some of our cartoonists 

184
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,800
to illustrate your catalog?

185
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,300
Well, we're hoping that 
if perhaps the catalog is a little funnier,

186
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:57,300
people won't be so quick 
to return the clothes.

187
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,200
For example, I--I really do...

188
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,600
well, I love this one.

189
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,600
Oh, yeah. 

190
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,600
That's a rather clever jab 
at inter-office politics, don't you think?

191
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,700
Uh-huh... Yeah... 

192
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:17,700
But why is it that 
the animals enjoy reading the email?

193
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,900
Well, Miss Benes, 

194
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,900
cartoons are like gossamer 
and one doesn't dissect gossamer.

195
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,800
Well, you don't have to dissect it,

196
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,800
if you can just tell me 
why this is supposed to be funny.

197
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Oh, it's merely a commentary 
on contemporary mores.

198
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,800
But, what is the comment? 

199
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,800
It's a slice of life.

200
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,600
No, it isn't.

201
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,300
A pun?

202
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,400
I don't think so.

203
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,700
Vorshtein?

204
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,300
That's not a word.

205
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,800
You have no idea what this means, 
do you?

206
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,500
No.

207
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,800
Then why did you print it?

208
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,200
I liked the kitty.

209
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,000
You know what? 

210
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,300
You people 
should be ashamed of yourself.

211
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,200
You know, you doodle 
a couple of bears at a cocktail party 

212
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,100
talking about the stock market, 
you think you're doing comedy.

213
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,500
Actually, that's not bad.

214
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,500
Well, you know-- 
I have others.

215
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,800
Sally, I can't believe 
you're already doing a one-woman show.

216
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,000
No, it's just 
a little performance piece I wrote.

217
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You know what? You really inspired me, okay? 
A tear?

218
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,800
Ah! There you are.

219
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,100
Oh, right, code of silence.

220
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:36,100
How's that going?

221
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,600
Thank you.

222
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,300
Hi, everybody.

223
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,200
I think you're really going to like this, 
'cos it's about me.

224
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,700
All right, it's not just about me.

225
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:49,700
It's about me and this guy, 
Jerry Seinfeld, 

226
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,100
who I like to call The Devil.

227
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,600
Okay, so... 
I run into this Jerry on the street,

228
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,300
and he says to me, "Hey Sally, 
you stink, you should give up acting." 

229
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,600
Oh! 
I'm doing Jerry now, okay?

230
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,600
So you have to imagine I have 
horns, a tail and hooks instead of feet. 

231
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,800
 to Kramer Oh, shut up!

232
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,000
She does a full hour 
about how you're the devil? 

233
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,300
I got to go see this thing.

234
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,900
Good luck. 
It's sold out for the next three weeks.

235
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,800
Well, I bet I can get in 
once I mention I'm from--

236
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,100
the New Yorker.

237
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,000
The New Yorker?

238
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,900
Yes, The New Yorker.

239
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,700
I met with their cartoon editor,

240
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,700
and I got him to admit that that cartoon

241
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,200
made no sense!

242
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,900
Wow! Good work, Nancy Drew!

243
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,700
Then we ended up going out to lunch,

244
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,200
and he had some great gossip 
about James Thurber.

245
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,900
Nodding off...

246
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:51,900
And he said I could submit 
some of my own cartoons.

247
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,000
Wow! That's incredible!

248
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,100
But you don't draw.

249
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,100
I do too.

250
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,200
What, your sad little horsies? 

251
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,600
The house with the little curl of smoke?

252
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,900
The sunflower with the smiley face?

253
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,500
The transparent cube...  as she leaves

254
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,600
It's better than 
your drawings of naked Lois Lane.

255
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,600
Where did you see that? 
Those are private!

256
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,100
Jerry, sorry I'm late. 

257
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,800
Channel Nine is doing 
a piece on my show. 

258
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,300
Isn't that great? 

259
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,000
Do you hate me?

260
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,900
No, no, I tought 
the show was terrific. 

261
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:27,900
I was just wondering if you have to keep saying
"Jerry Seinfeld is the devil."

262
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,500
Well, that is the title.

263
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,400
I know, but I thought maybe 
you could mention how I apologized, 

264
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,000
then encouraged you to stick with it.

265
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,600
You know I workshopped that and, uh-- 

266
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,400
Snoozers! 

267
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,400
But I'll tell you what, 
I'll tinker.

268
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,200
It's all a journey.

269
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,400
Thanks.

270
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,600
You got a little shmootz there.

271
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,500
Excuse me.

272
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,400
Miss Weaver? 
Oh, my God, it is you! 

273
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,100
I--I've seen your show six times!

274
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,500
What a surprise.

275
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,000
You're great. 
It's great.

276
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It's so great to see a show 
that's about something.

277
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,900
Where to?

278
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,300
<i>My friends are idiots. She doesn't look like Jerry.</i>

279
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,600
<i>She doesn't look like anybody.</i>

280
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,800
<i>And so what if she does look like Jerry?</i>

281
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,800
<i>What does that mean?</i>

282
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,100
<i>That I could have everything I have with Jerry, </i>

283
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,500
<i>but because it's a woman I could also have sex with her.</i>

284
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,500
<i>And somehow, that would be exactly what I always wanted.</i>

285
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,900
<i>She doesn't even look like Jerry!</i>

286
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,800
You know I really do look a lot like your friend Jerry.

287
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,800
I know.

288
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,800
Thanks for watching Nine News. 

289
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,100
We leave you tonight with a scene 
from Sally Weaver's one woman show.

290
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:02,100
OK, so I go to meet Jerry Seinfeld 
at this horrible coffee shop, right? 

291
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,900
And he's like,
"Hey, stop doing your show!" 

292
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,300
And I'm like, 
"Hello! It's a free country!" 

293
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,600
So then he goes, 
"Okay, Shmootsie."

294
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,600
And he starts 
pulling at my sweater, right?

295
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,700
He's getting all, you know, 
Hands Across America.

296
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,900
There really was shmootz! 
I didn't try and grab her!

297
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:18,900
And this is what he looks like 
when he is eating.

298
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,400
Get out of my house!

299
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,600
Well boys, I did it. 

300
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,800
I had to stay up all night,

301
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,800
but I finally came up 
with a great New Yorker cartoon.

302
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:35,900
I've stayed up all night, 
I fix myself up a little before I go out.

303
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,800
That is not the point.

304
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,500
Some mouthwash, 
a hat, something.

305
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,000
Just read it!

306
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,700
glances at it Pretty good.

307
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,200
Pretty good? Wha--

308
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,600
This is a gem!

309
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,200
Kramer, look at it!

310
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:54,900
What?

311
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,300
It's funny!

312
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,000
It's a pig 
at a complaint department.

313
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Yeah, and he's saying, 
"I wish I was taller"!

314
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,900
See? That's his complaint.

315
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,900
I get it.

316
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,800
Do you?

317
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,600
Because that's not a normal complaint.

318
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,300
How 'bout if it was something like, 

319
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:17,300
"I can't find my receipt. 
My place is a sty."

320
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,900
Everything with you 
has to be so jokey.

321
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,400
I'm a comedian.

322
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,400
"I wish I was taller", that's-- 
nice. That's real.

323
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:35,100
Well, I got a complaint. 
This cartoon stinks.

324
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,300
I'll tell you 
who doesn't think it stinks.

325
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,100
The New Yorker. 

326
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,600
That's right. 
They're publishing it in their next issue. 

327
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,200
Oh! You know what? 

328
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,200
I just ran into Newman in the hall. 
He said you tried to grope Sally Weaver?

329
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,400
That's it. 
I'm gonna put an end to this.

330
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,300
Wha--

331
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:01,300
The pig says, 
"My wife is a slut"?

332
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,600
Now that's a complaint.

333
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,200
Hello Sally. 
Yeah, this is Jerry.

334
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,400
I just wanted to leave you a message 
to let you know 

335
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,200
I caught your little piece on TV, and...

336
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,300
<i>...I'm getting a little tired 
of hearing about how horrible I am,</i>

337
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:23,300
and I would appreciate it if you would 
leave me out of your act all together.

338
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,900
That's it. 
I'm calling in the big guns.

339
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:31,900
"To cease and desist on behalf of 
my client, Jerry Seinfeld."

340
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,800
Crybaby Jerry Seinfeld's Lawyer.

341
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,700
OK, well, I got two words for you, 
Jerry Seinfeld:

342
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:43,700
---- you!

343
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,200
How could she say that on TV?

344
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:50,200
And how did she get a cable special? I 've never gotten a cable special!

345
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,000
Well, that's it. 

346
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I'm not giving her any more material. 
We are incomunicado.

347
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:01,300
Exactly.

348
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:05,400
Check it out, 
from the new issue of the New Yorker.

349
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,400
It's funny, isn't it?

350
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,700
Look at it. 
The pig wants to be taller. 

351
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,200
And what's this guy gonna say, huh?

352
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,900
Nothin'!

353
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,900
Elaine, I'm afraid 
I have incurred yet another flat tire.

354
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,400
Can I fix that after lunch, sir?

355
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,000
Oh, no. Right away, chop chop.

356
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,900
Oh! a new cartoon.

357
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:29,900
"I wish I was taller."

358
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,500
I'd like to see 
that complaint get rectified.

359
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,400
You see? See? 

360
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,400
Smart people think this is funny. 
And you want to know why?

361
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,700
'Cause I wrote it.

362
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:46,400
You shouldn't make fun of pigs.

363
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,200
Flash of lightning, Elaine. 
I just realized why I like this cartoon so much.

364
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,600
Oh! Do tell, sir?

365
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,200
It's a Ziggy!

366
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,300
A Ziggy?

367
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,100
That irreverence, that wit! 
I'd recognize it anywhere. 

368
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:01,100
Some charlatan has stolen a Ziggy 
and passed it off as his own. 

369
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,700
I can prove it. 

370
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,700
Quick Elaine, to my archives.

371
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,500
You know what's great 
about our relationship?

372
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,000
It's not about looks.

373
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,600
It's not?

374
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,100
No. It can't be.

375
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:19,900
OK.

376
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:23,900
For instance I remember, when we first met
we had a great conversation.

377
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,600
I remember you said 
I was the prettiest girl at the party.

378
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:33,000
But then after that 
we really talked, didn't we?

379
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Well, you told me how familiar I looked,
and that you must have seen me somewhere before.

380
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,900
This relationship 
has got to be about something, 

381
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:47,900
and fast, 
or I'm in very serious and weird trouble.

382
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,700
What else happened?

383
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,700
You asked for a piece of gum because 
you thought your breath smelled like hummus.

384
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,500
All right, yes! 
Gum!

385
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,300
Good enough. 
I'll take it.

386
00:18:59,300 --> 00:18:59,700
I like gum.

387
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,200
I do, too. 

388
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,000
You see, 
that's what we're about. 

389
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
You don't remind me of anyone
and we love gum.

390
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,500
I have gum in my hair.

391
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,500
I'm losin' it.

392
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,100
Hey! You're Jerry's friend! 
You're Kooky!

393
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,400
Mind if I sit?

394
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,200
My show is going really well. 
Have you seen it yet?

395
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,900
You should. 
Everybody else in town has.

396
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,900
Oh, you know what? 
I got recognized the other day!

397
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,300
How weird is that? 

398
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,400
I know. 

399
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,200
At first I liked the attention, 
but after a while it's like,

400
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,200
"Whoa! Take three steps back. 
Get a life, okay?"

401
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,800
But there wouldn't be a Sally Weaver 
without the fans, you know what I mean?

402
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,500
But who am I anyway? 

403
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,400
I mean there's Sally Weaver the woman, 

404
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,000
Sally Weaver the artist, 
Sally Weaver the person...

405
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
No, you gotta shut up!

406
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,600
I'm sorry, I--I haven't spoken in days.

407
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,100
Well, lay it on me, string bean.

408
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,300
Let me get this gum out of my hair, 
and then I'll be ready for bed.

409
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,800
OK, look, 
the gum isn't cutting it for me. 

410
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,100
We need to be about something else.

411
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:01,700
Anything. Please.

412
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,100
George.

413
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,600
Your hair?

414
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,600
Well I had to cut the gum out, 
and I had a little trouble getting it even. 

415
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,800
So why don't you get undressed, George?

416
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,800
George is in big trouble!

417
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,800
You ripped off a Ziggy?

418
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,900
It must've seeped into my subconscious.

419
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:29,500
Puddy has Ziggy bed sheets.

420
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,300
D'you read the comics today?

421
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,600
I see Ziggy's back at the complaint department.

422
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,000
"The New Yorker's stealing my ideas."

423
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,700
See that's funny.

424
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,000
'Cause it's real.

425
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,300
Hey, look it! Sally's cable show's on!

426
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,300
Hey, Kramer! Come on in. 

427
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,400
You've got to watch this. 

428
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,700
This will be funny. Now she's got nothing.

429
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,400
Master of Evil Jerry Seinfeld 
broke off all contact with me.

430
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,300
That's right, sister. 
Why don't you just give up?

431
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,700
Why are you yelling at the TV?

432
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,700
OK, get this. 

433
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:04,700
I heard he makes his best friend 
date women who look just like him.

434
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,400
Hello, issues!

435
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,500
Elaine, have you been talking to her?

436
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,400
Hey, I'm just a fan.

437
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,500
Oh, and speaking of issues. 

438
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,600
Guess who got a no-polish manicure 

439
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,600
and begged his neighbor 
not to tell anyone?

440
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,700
I thought you stopped talking?

441
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:25,700
All right. 
Starting-- now.

442
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,400
You broke up with her just because 
she cut her hair? How short?

443
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,800
Like that.

444
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,600
You mean like...

445
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,900
... that.

446
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,700
So she...

447
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,500
Yes.

448
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,200
And you don't...

449
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:42,600
No.

450
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,100
So...

451
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:47,100
Exactly.

452
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:51,100
We... must never ever speak of this again.

453
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:55,100
No. No.

454
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,100
Hey, you want to go see a movie?

455
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:03,100
Actually, I think 
I'm gonna take a few days off.

456
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:07,100
I think that's for the best.
