1
00:00:02,076 --> 00:00:04,363
I got no leg room back here.
Move your seat forward.

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,371
That's as far as it goes.

3
00:00:06,463 --> 00:00:08,154
There's a mechanism. You just pull it,

4
00:00:08,155 --> 00:00:09,444
and throw your body weight.

5
00:00:09,498 --> 00:00:11,778
I pulled it. It doesn't go.

6
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:13,384
If you want the leg room, say you want

7
00:00:13,385 --> 00:00:15,523
the leg room! Don't blame the mechanism!

8
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,133
All right, Dad, we're five blocks

9
00:00:17,134 --> 00:00:18,609
from the house.  Sit sideways.

10
00:00:18,626 --> 00:00:21,258
Like an animal. Because of her,
I have to sit here like an animal!

11
00:00:21,602 --> 00:00:24,953
Serenity now! Serenity now!
What is that?

12
00:00:25,309 --> 00:00:27,568
Doctor gave me a relaxation cassette.

13
00:00:27,918 --> 00:00:30,211
When my blood pressure
gets too high, the man

14
00:00:30,212 --> 00:00:32,855
on the tape tells me
to say, 'Serenity now!'

15
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:34,807
Are you supposed to yell it?

16
00:00:34,974 --> 00:00:37,195
The man on the tape wasn't specific.

17
00:00:37,894 --> 00:00:40,038
What happened to the screen door?
It blew off again?

18
00:00:40,093 --> 00:00:44,956
I told you to fix that thing.
Serenity nowww!

19
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,310
So I told Bobby and Lisa that  we'd try

20
00:00:50,397 --> 00:00:52,718
the new Chinese Spanish  place
La Caridad on Saturday.

21
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,973
Oh, I thought we had tickets
for the Knicks home opener.

22
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,237
Well I thought this would be more fun
so I gave the tickets away.

23
00:00:58,085 --> 00:01:02,952
What? All right, fine.
Are you mad at me?

24
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:07,141
No, I love a good Chinese Spanish
whatever it is.

25
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,907
You know... I've never seen you mad.
I get peeved.

26
00:01:12,069 --> 00:01:13,614
Mad.
Miffed.

27
00:01:13,653 --> 00:01:14,630
*Mad*.
Irked?

28
00:01:16,301 --> 00:01:19,629
I'd like to see you get *really* mad.

29
00:01:22,644 --> 00:01:26,165
Why does she want you to be mad?
She says I suppress my emotions.

30
00:01:26,501 --> 00:01:30,134
So what do you care what she thinks.
Good body.

31
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:33,806
She probably gets that impression
because you're cool.

32
00:01:33,887 --> 00:01:36,597
You're under control. Like me.
Nothing wrong with that.

33
00:01:37,767 --> 00:01:40,445
But I get upset, I've yelled.
You've heard me yell.

34
00:01:40,486 --> 00:01:43,621
Not really. Your voice kind of raises
to this comedic pitch.

35
00:01:45,877 --> 00:01:49,428
Kramer, I am so sick of you comin' in here
and eatin' all my food.

36
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:52,453
Now shut that door and get
the hell out of here!

37
00:01:58,405 --> 00:02:00,462
What is that, a new bit?

38
00:02:01,597 --> 00:02:04,269
I told ya. Hey, any of you guys
want to come out

39
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,219
and help me fix  my father's screen
door in Queens?

40
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,857
Sorry, I'm fixing a screen door in the Bronx.
I'll do it.

41
00:02:09,886 --> 00:02:12,823
Really? You wanna come?
Yeah, I love going to the country.

42
00:02:18,316 --> 00:02:20,660
Where are they goin'?
Fix a screen door in Queens.

43
00:02:22,076 --> 00:02:25,767
That's funny. Hey, listen, what are
you doin' Saturday night?

44
00:02:25,768 --> 00:02:27,648
Not goin' to the Knick game.

45
00:02:27,891 --> 00:02:31,008
I need someone to go with me
to Mr. Lippman's son's Bar Mitzvah.

46
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:33,800
You know, if you don't bring a guest
they save a catering.

47
00:02:33,807 --> 00:02:35,535
You should be able to buy
a cheaper gift.

48
00:02:35,679 --> 00:02:38,863
Oh, I don't think that's possible.

49
00:02:42,207 --> 00:02:48,824
Get in a little closer.
I can't see the screen door. Perfect.

50
00:02:49,057 --> 00:02:51,133
Dad, the hinges are all rusted here.

51
00:02:51,134 --> 00:02:53,687
That's why the wind keeps
blowing the door off.

52
00:02:53,813 --> 00:02:59,247
I hate that old door. Throw it out!
Serenity now!

53
00:02:59,433 --> 00:03:02,119
It might be time to just let her go,
Frank. She's worked hard for ya.

54
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:03,726
Will you put her to rest for me?

55
00:03:03,741 --> 00:03:05,560
Oh yeah, I'll take good care of her.

56
00:03:12,388 --> 00:03:16,791
Get George to put those
boxes in the garage.

57
00:03:17,104 --> 00:03:20,047
Dad, what's all this?
It's junk.

58
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:22,051
My computers. I've been selling them

59
00:03:22,052 --> 00:03:24,000
for two months now. Shut up!

60
00:03:25,674 --> 00:03:28,743
You're selling computers?
Two months ago,

61
00:03:28,977 --> 00:03:31,320
I saw a provocative movie
on cable TV.

62
00:03:31,384 --> 00:03:34,766
It was called The Net, with
that girl from the bus.

63
00:03:35,222 --> 00:03:39,975
I did a little reading, and I realize,
it wasn't that farfetched.

64
00:03:40,173 --> 00:03:43,749
Dad, you know what it takes
to compete with Microsoft and   IBM?

65
00:03:43,878 --> 00:03:49,888
Yes, I do. That's why I got
a secret weapon... my son.

66
00:03:53,397 --> 00:03:56,669
Damn it, they gave me cream!
I asked for nonfat milk!

67
00:03:58,037 --> 00:04:00,132
I think they have 1% over there.

68
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:04,039
1%?! They can kiss 1% of my ass!

69
00:04:05,227 --> 00:04:07,825
OK, Jerry, enough.
I'm not buying it.

70
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:10,403
You're damn right you're not buying it!

71
00:04:11,204 --> 00:04:13,788
You shouldn't have to try.
It's just being open.

72
00:04:14,244 --> 00:04:17,313
I'm open. There's just nothing
in there.

73
00:04:17,996 --> 00:04:21,011
Oh, you think I'm lying about this?
I think you are.

74
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,933
Well, I'm not.
Yes, you are, liar.

75
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,533
Oh, stop it.
OK, liar.

76
00:04:24,679 --> 00:04:27,164
That's enough!
Ooh, that was good.

77
00:04:27,438 --> 00:04:29,149
Really? It felt good.

78
00:04:30,589 --> 00:04:36,555
Congratulations, Mr. Lippman.
Oh, Elaine. My boy's a man today

79
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:48,103
Can you believe it? He's a man.
I'm a man!

80
00:04:51,173 --> 00:04:53,086
Tongue?
Yeah.

81
00:04:56,052 --> 00:04:58,781
Wow! I didn't try
that 'til I was 23.

82
00:05:00,124 --> 00:05:02,101
Well this kid's not just a man.
He's a man's man.

83
00:05:03,566 --> 00:05:05,845
And I think he's been
telling his friends.

84
00:05:05,846 --> 00:05:08,577
I got invitations to
six more Bar Mitzvahs.

85
00:05:10,575 --> 00:05:13,005
Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld.

86
00:05:13,173 --> 00:05:17,005
No, no, no, I do not want to
stop over in Cincinnati.

87
00:05:17,325 --> 00:05:21,989
Well, then you upgrade me.
That's right, you should thank me.

88
00:05:23,836 --> 00:05:27,589
Hey, I'm flyin' first class.
Where did that come from?

89
00:05:27,745 --> 00:05:31,210
Patty showed me how to get mad.
You gotta problem with that?

90
00:05:32,781 --> 00:05:33,774
No.
Good.

91
00:05:34,036 --> 00:05:36,037
All right, relax, tough guy.

92
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,924
I got to go out to my father's
garage, help him sell some computers.

93
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,628
What? The two of you workin' in that

94
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:42,671
garage is like a steel cage death match.

95
00:05:47,528 --> 00:05:48,796
Kramer.
Yeah.

96
00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:52,469
What-what are you doing?
Oh, I'm putting up Frank's screen door.

97
00:05:52,564 --> 00:05:54,812
This beauty's got a
little life in her yet.

98
00:05:54,939 --> 00:05:59,732
What do you need it for?
he cool evening breezes of Anytown, USA.

99
00:06:00,236 --> 00:06:05,788
Let's see how this baby closes.
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

100
00:06:07,381 --> 00:06:09,476
Morning, ma.
You're late!

101
00:06:12,363 --> 00:06:13,564
Morning, dad.

102
00:06:13,643 --> 00:06:16,259
I'm not 'dad' in the workplace.
My professional name is Mr. Costanza

103
00:06:16,307 --> 00:06:19,595
and I will refer to you
as 'Costanza'. Morning, Braun.

104
00:06:19,787 --> 00:06:22,883
Morning, George.
Two cream, no sugar.

105
00:06:24,224 --> 00:06:28,603
What is Lloyd Braun doing here?
Your mother recommended him.

106
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:29,266
Yeah, of course she did.

107
00:06:29,267 --> 00:06:30,670
That's all I ever heard growing up

108
00:06:30,671 --> 00:06:32,969
is 'Why can't you be
more like Lloyd Braun?'

109
00:06:32,978 --> 00:06:37,252
Did you know he was in a mental institution?
I didn't read his resume.

110
00:06:38,275 --> 00:06:41,853
Another sale, Mr. Costanza.
Chalk me up on the big board.

111
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:48,636
What is this?
This is your lagging. Good work, Braun.

112
00:06:49,099 --> 00:06:51,411
Good for you, Lloyd!

113
00:06:53,084 --> 00:06:57,365
So Adam, I just talked to your father,
and, apology
accepted.

114
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:01,236
I'm not apologizing. It was great.
I told everyone.

115
00:07:02,531 --> 00:07:05,387
Yeah, I know. Uh, by the way,
could you do me a favor

116
00:07:06,036 --> 00:07:07,475
and tell Mitchell
Tanenbaum that I will be

117
00:07:07,476 --> 00:07:09,013
unable to attend this Saturday.

118
00:07:10,204 --> 00:07:16,366
Are you free Friday night?
I am, but that is not the point.

119
00:07:16,531 --> 00:07:20,879
You are thirteen, and I am
in my early... 20s.

120
00:07:21,812 --> 00:07:25,634
But I'm a man. The rabbi said so.
No. You are not a man.

121
00:07:25,635 --> 00:07:27,907
It takes a *long* time to become
a man.

122
00:07:27,955 --> 00:07:30,947
I mean, half my friends
aren't even there yet.

123
00:07:31,255 --> 00:07:34,796
Well, if I'm not a man, then this
whole thing was a sham!

124
00:07:34,946 --> 00:07:36,507
First,they said I was gonna get great

125
00:07:36,508 --> 00:07:38,469
gifts, and then, somebody gives me

126
00:07:40,637 --> 00:07:42,996
I renounce my religion!
Who wants cookies?

127
00:07:42,997 --> 00:07:46,727
As of this moment, I am no
longer Jewish. I quit!

128
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:50,940
What?
Walnuts, mmmmmm.

129
00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:53,169
You're late again, Costanza,
so listen up.

130
00:07:53,981 --> 00:07:56,394
Starting tonight, we're
having a little sales contest.

131
00:07:56,398 --> 00:07:59,086
The loser gets fired, the winner
gets a Waterpik.

132
00:07:59,348 --> 00:08:04,109
You're not giving away our Waterpik!
Serenity now!

133
00:08:04,338 --> 00:08:07,267
You know what?
It doesn't matter, because I quit!

134
00:08:07,309 --> 00:08:08,862
I guess your mother was right

135
00:08:08,932 --> 00:08:12,078
You never could compete
with Lloyd Braun!

136
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,811
You wanna sell computers?

137
00:08:17,812 --> 00:08:21,110
I will show *you* how to sell computers!

138
00:08:24,118 --> 00:08:29,830
Hello, Mr. Farneman. You wanna buy
a computer? No? Why not?

139
00:08:30,901 --> 00:08:34,844
All right, I see! Good answer!
Thank you!

140
00:08:37,276 --> 00:08:40,077
Serenity now!

141
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:45,728
Adam, you don't become a man
overnight. Look at your father.

142
00:08:46,047 --> 00:08:49,116
It takes time. Patience, experience.

143
00:08:49,117 --> 00:08:53,096
Uh, several careers of varying success.

144
00:08:53,128 --> 00:08:56,568
And these are things
I look for in a man.

145
00:08:56,624 --> 00:09:00,424
Well, that does me a lot of
good. 'Early 20s'!

146
00:09:02,144 --> 00:09:04,318
Well, I'm sorry, sir, I tried.

147
00:09:04,394 --> 00:09:06,496
So, that's the type of guy
you're looking for?

148
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,728
Uhh. I guess so. Why?

149
00:09:13,669 --> 00:09:19,688
What is this?
Anytown, U.S.A. Hello?

150
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:25,654
Is Kramer home? Oh, hey.
Hello, neighbor.

151
00:09:25,709 --> 00:09:28,053
Boy, those azaleas are really
coming in nicely.

152
00:09:28,189 --> 00:09:31,787
Oh, you gotta mulch. You've got to.
You barbecuing tonight?

153
00:09:31,788 --> 00:09:42,180
Right after the fireworks.
So, where do you want to eat tonight?

154
00:09:42,252 --> 00:09:44,619
How about La Caridad again?

155
00:09:45,396 --> 00:09:48,169
Again!? How much flan
can a person eat!?

156
00:09:48,628 --> 00:09:51,180
Jerry, you've been yelling
at me all afternoon.

157
00:09:51,492 --> 00:09:53,846
Well, I don't think more flan
is the answer!

158
00:09:54,418 --> 00:09:56,211
Maybe I should just leave.
'Maybe'!?

159
00:09:56,572 --> 00:09:59,356
Good-bye!
Double good-bye!

160
00:10:03,452 --> 00:10:07,628
Hey, buddy!
Hey. Happy New Year!

161
00:10:08,516 --> 00:10:15,528
Y'all come back reeeaall...
Did you and Patty just break up?

162
00:10:15,611 --> 00:10:17,479
Yeah! In fact, she broke up with me!

163
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,850
And I don't want to talk about it!

164
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,491
Well, then you're free tonight.

165
00:10:22,515 --> 00:10:25,699
You know what, I heard about
this great place called La Caridad.

166
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:28,226
That's the last thing she said to me.

167
00:10:28,435 --> 00:10:31,073
She wanted to go there also,
but I wasn't in the mood.

168
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:35,154
Whoa. What is the matter?
It's Patty.

169
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:38,827
Jerry, you break up with
a girl every week.

170
00:10:42,811 --> 00:10:49,227
What-what is this salty discharge?
Oh my God. You're crying.

171
00:10:49,283 --> 00:10:53,490
This is horrible! I care!

172
00:10:56,667 --> 00:11:00,370
Patty won't call me back.
I don't know if I can live without her.

173
00:11:00,522 --> 00:11:02,705
She's really gotten to you,
hasn't she?

174
00:11:02,738 --> 00:11:04,250
I don't know what's happening to me.

175
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:08,266
Simple. You let out one emotion,
all the rest will come  with it.

176
00:11:08,326 --> 00:11:10,283
It's like Endora's box.

177
00:11:10,314 --> 00:11:13,753
That was the mother on
Bewitched. You mean Pandora.

178
00:11:13,834 --> 00:11:16,138
Yeah, well, she... had one, too.

179
00:11:18,194 --> 00:11:20,533
Jerry, can I talk to you for a second?

180
00:11:27,026 --> 00:11:28,802
That's it, that's it!

181
00:11:28,847 --> 00:11:32,053
I warned you kids. I told you not
to play in front of my house.

182
00:11:32,193 --> 00:11:38,090
This time, I'm keepin' it. And you're not
getting back your rock either!

183
00:11:43,874 --> 00:11:46,098
Are you still down in
the dumps? Come on.

184
00:11:46,154 --> 00:11:47,424
It's just a chick.

185
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:49,666
You ever heard of a little thing
called feelings?

186
00:11:49,696 --> 00:11:53,728
Well, I got just the thing
to cheer you up. A computer!

187
00:11:54,385 --> 00:11:56,521
Huh? We can check porn,
and stock quotes.

188
00:11:58,433 --> 00:12:02,721
Porn quotes... I'm so lucky to have
a friend like you, George.

189
00:12:03,409 --> 00:12:10,784
Ever  tell you how much I love you?
What?

190
00:12:11,537 --> 00:12:15,727
I love you, George. Come here.
I-I'm already here.

191
00:12:16,246 --> 00:12:16,930
I'm here. I'm here.
Uh, you know what?

192
00:12:16,931 --> 00:12:19,115
If you want a computer,
call me. I-I gotta go.

193
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,462
Go wherever you want.
I'm still gonna love you.

194
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:24,784
Look what they did. Look what
they did to my house!

195
00:12:24,807 --> 00:12:26,127
I turn my back for two seconds,

196
00:12:26,128 --> 00:12:28,529
and they put shaving
cream all over my door.

197
00:12:28,575 --> 00:12:31,887
You, I see
you! I'll teach these kids a lesson.

198
00:12:32,055 --> 00:12:34,144
Where's that house I put
under your sink?

199
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,433
Hose under my sink.
I love *you*, Kramer!

200
00:12:37,014 --> 00:12:39,558
I love you, too, buddy, and George
I don't want to hear it, Kramer!

201
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:40,891
Listen, when I give you the signal,

202
00:12:40,892 --> 00:12:42,611
I want you to turn this
water on full blast.

203
00:12:42,612 --> 00:12:46,332
What signal? What-what signal?
I'll yell, uh, 'Hoochie mama!'

204
00:12:46,407 --> 00:12:49,052
If I do it, will you buy a computer?
On the signal, George. On the signal.

205
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,908
Only if you buy. I gotta make a sale.
I love you, Costanza.

206
00:12:53,049 --> 00:12:54,289
Will you shut up?!

207
00:12:54,508 --> 00:12:56,035
Now! Now, George!
Turn on the faucet!

208
00:12:56,036 --> 00:13:00,324
George, turn on the faucet!
Hoochie mama! Hoochie mama!

209
00:13:05,135 --> 00:13:08,168
So now the *other* Lippman kissed me.
Well, sure.

210
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:10,351
Well, sure. They're Jewish, and you're
a shiksa.  What?

211
00:13:10,487 --> 00:13:13,167
It means a non-Jewish woman.
I know what it means,

212
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:15,446
but what does being a shiksa
have to do with it?

213
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,006
You've got 'shiksappeal'.

214
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:17,834
Jewish men love the idea of meeting

215
00:13:17,835 --> 00:13:19,110
a woman that's not like their mother.

216
00:13:19,494 --> 00:13:20,845
Oh, that's insane.

217
00:13:20,886 --> 00:13:22,248
I'll tell you what's insane:

218
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:24,839
the price that I could get you
on a new desktop computer.

219
00:13:24,934 --> 00:13:27,527
I am not buying a computer from you.
There's porn.

220
00:13:27,982 --> 00:13:30,274
Even so.
Damn it!

221
00:13:33,302 --> 00:13:35,174
Don't get me wrong, Mr. Lippman.

222
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:38,487
I-I'm very flattered that
you found me attractive enough to...

223
00:13:38,493 --> 00:13:43,629
lunge at me. Huh. But the only reason
you like me is because I'm a shiksa.

224
00:13:43,677 --> 00:13:45,974
That's simply not true.

225
00:13:46,036 --> 00:13:48,334
If you weren't Jewish, you
wouldn't be interested in me.

226
00:13:48,413 --> 00:13:51,070
You are wrong. I'll prove it.
Oh, no. Don't!

227
00:13:51,214 --> 00:13:54,751
I renounce Judaism!
Oy vey!

228
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:58,948
What happened to you, pal?

229
00:13:59,087 --> 00:14:01,426
Joey Zanfino and some
of the neighborhood kids.

230
00:14:01,526 --> 00:14:03,842
They ambushed me
with a box of 'Grade A's.

231
00:14:04,487 --> 00:14:06,813
Are you all right?
Oh, no. I'm fine.

232
00:14:06,915 --> 00:14:11,355
Serenity now. Serenity now.
Serenity now.

233
00:14:12,054 --> 00:14:14,575
So, you're using Frank's
relaxation method?

234
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:18,439
Jerry, the anger, it just melts
right off. Serenity now.

235
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:26,410
Look at this. Serenity now!

236
00:14:30,862 --> 00:14:33,776
Hey, what happened to you?
Serenity!

237
00:14:34,517 --> 00:14:38,911
Well. You are not gonna believe this.
Now Lippman is renounced.

238
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:43,452
This shiksa thing is *totally* out of control.
What is  *with* you people?

239
00:14:46,367 --> 00:14:50,331
What are you looking at?
Sit down, Elaine.

240
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:53,039
Oh, no. Jerry, I can't take
any more gentle sobbing.

241
00:14:53,175 --> 00:14:55,550
I've been thinking about what
it means to be complete.

242
00:14:55,655 --> 00:14:57,320
Do you have an apple or anything?

243
00:14:57,351 --> 00:14:59,820
Look at us, hurtling through
space on this big, blue marble.

244
00:14:59,821 --> 00:15:01,648
Or a nectarine? I would absolutely
love a nectarine.

245
00:15:01,649 --> 00:15:03,969
Looking everywhere for
some kind of meaning...

246
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:06,205
Why am I in such a fruit mood?
Ahh, banana!

247
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:08,008
When all the while, the real secret

248
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,822
to happiness has been
right in  front of us!

249
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:13,335
What?
Elaine...

250
00:15:15,287 --> 00:15:17,888
Jerry, I've found a way
to beat Lloyd Braun!

251
00:15:17,989 --> 00:15:20,421
I buy the computers myself, I
store 'em in your apartment.

252
00:15:20,493 --> 00:15:22,318
Then, after I win the
contest, I bring 'em

253
00:15:22,469 --> 00:15:24,173
all back and get my money back.

254
00:15:25,228 --> 00:15:28,671
Ha ha! It's brilliant. What? What's
wrong with your leg?

255
00:15:29,316 --> 00:15:31,229
I'm asking Elaine to marry me.

256
00:15:37,252 --> 00:15:39,533
I'll store these over
at Kramer's apartment.

257
00:15:44,797 --> 00:15:47,012
Elaine?
Uhh, Jerry,

258
00:15:47,996 --> 00:15:51,237
I've got a lot goin' on with, uh,
Lippman  right now.

259
00:15:51,349 --> 00:15:56,069
Lippman?
Yeah, and him too. What?!

260
00:15:56,397 --> 00:16:00,188
Oh, yeah! I think George is calling me,

261
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,316
so I'm gonna go give him a hand

262
00:16:03,149 --> 00:16:06,189
Come on! Come on!
Can I help you?

263
00:16:06,965 --> 00:16:08,604
No. Stay! Stay. Stay.

264
00:16:08,605 --> 00:16:11,133
Hey, Braun, Costanza's kicking your butt!

265
00:16:11,568 --> 00:16:18,348
Watch how it's done. Oh, hello,
Mr. Vandelay?

266
00:16:20,221 --> 00:16:24,758
Would you like to buy a computer?
Oh, really? Two dozen?

267
00:16:25,955 --> 00:16:28,012
Costanza, you're white hot!

268
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:32,434
If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up and--

269
00:16:32,556 --> 00:16:34,931
Hey, Braun, I got good news
and bad news.

270
00:16:35,076 --> 00:16:36,900
And they're both the same: you're fired.

271
00:16:37,084 --> 00:16:39,212
Costanza, you've won the water pik!

272
00:16:39,595 --> 00:16:41,796
You're not gonna give away
that water pik!

273
00:16:41,963 --> 00:16:45,181
You wanna bet? Serenity now,
serenity now!

274
00:16:45,299 --> 00:16:49,596
You know, you should tell your dad
that 'serenity now' thing doesn't work.

275
00:16:49,598 --> 00:16:53,388
It just bottles up the anger,
and eventually, you blow.

276
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,327
What do you know?
You were in the nut house.

277
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:57,328
What do you think put me there?

278
00:16:57,329 --> 00:16:59,379
I heard they found a family
in your freezer

279
00:17:00,243 --> 00:17:04,369
Serenity now. Insanity later.

280
00:17:05,795 --> 00:17:07,730
What happened here,
Kramer?

281
00:17:08,167 --> 00:17:10,237
Serenity now, serenity now...
Kramer!

282
00:17:11,227 --> 00:17:14,707
Geez! Jerry, I didn't here you come in.

283
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:18,689
Yeah, the children,  they've
done sum redecorating.

284
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:21,794
Serenity now, serenity now.
You don't look well.

285
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:26,170
Well, that's odd, 'cause I feel perfectly
at peace with the world- uh!

286
00:17:28,977 --> 00:17:30,746
eggs! you! Serenity now, serenity now,
serenity now.

287
00:17:30,806 --> 00:17:33,843
Oh, I'm sorry. Look at me, I stepped
on your last rose.

288
00:17:33,906 --> 00:17:37,545
Jerry, come on. Don't get upset about
it.There's always next spring.

289
00:17:37,545 --> 00:17:43,546
Now will you excuse me for a moment.
Serenity nooooooooww!

290
00:17:43,673 --> 00:17:47,089
Jerry! I did it! Haha! I beat Braun!
Serenity now!

291
00:17:47,171 --> 00:17:49,141
Come on, wanna give me a hand
with the computers?

292
00:17:49,547 --> 00:17:51,994
Serenity nooooowwwww!

293
00:17:52,066 --> 00:17:54,737
Why couldn't you squeeze
one of those stupid

294
00:17:54,738 --> 00:17:56,986
rubber balls to get your stress out?

295
00:17:56,987 --> 00:18:00,608
Why did you have to destroy
*twenty-five* computers?

296
00:18:01,139 --> 00:18:16,595
George, you listen to me. I owe ya one.
He's incorrigible.

297
00:18:17,146 --> 00:18:18,435
You want to talk about it?

298
00:18:18,538 --> 00:18:21,612
Oh, please don't tell me you love me again,
Jerry, I can't handle it.

299
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:24,962
George, letting my emotions out was
the best thing I've ever done.

300
00:18:25,811 --> 00:18:28,171
Sure I'm not funny anymore, but there's

301
00:18:28,172 --> 00:18:30,288
more to life than making shallow,

302
00:18:30,538 --> 00:18:41,427
fairly-obvious observations. How about you?
All right... here goes...

303
00:18:45,206 --> 00:18:49,209
Rabbi, is there anything I can do
to combat this Shiks-appeal?

304
00:18:49,369 --> 00:18:53,248
Ha! Elaine, shiks-appeal is a myth,
like the Yeti,

305
00:18:53,371 --> 00:18:57,697
or his North
American cousin, the Sasquatch.

306
00:18:58,171 --> 00:18:59,736
Well, something's goin' on here,

307
00:19:00,024 --> 00:19:02,664
'cause every able-bodied
Israelite in the county

308
00:19:02,728 --> 00:19:04,735
is driving pretty strong to the hoop.

309
00:19:04,736 --> 00:19:08,153
Elaine, there's much you don't understand
about the Jewish religion.

310
00:19:08,241 --> 00:19:12,287
For example, did you know that rabbis
are allowed to date?

311
00:19:13,617 --> 00:19:15,272
Well, what does that have to do...?

312
00:19:15,273 --> 00:19:19,464
You know, a member of my congregation
has a timeshare in Myrtle  Beach.

313
00:19:19,647 --> 00:19:21,614
Perhaps, if you're
not too busy, we could

314
00:19:21,903 --> 00:19:24,545
wing on down after  the High Holidays?

315
00:19:25,056 --> 00:19:28,714
Elaine? 'Lainie?

316
00:19:30,624 --> 00:19:33,663
So, that's it. All of my darkest fears,

317
00:19:34,719 --> 00:19:38,155
and... everything I'm
capable of. That's me.

318
00:19:42,256 --> 00:19:46,088
Yikes. Well, good look with all that.

319
00:19:48,415 --> 00:19:52,495
Where you going? I-I thought I could count
on you for a little compassion.

320
00:19:52,544 --> 00:19:58,684
I think you scared me straight
All right, Jerome, I'm in.

321
00:19:58,767 --> 00:19:59,532
What?

322
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:01,276
Maybe we should get married.

323
00:20:01,324 --> 00:20:04,365
Maybe everything we need is
right here in front of us.

324
00:20:04,852 --> 00:20:10,045
Jer... let's do it.
I tell ya, I don't see it happening.

325
00:20:10,508 --> 00:20:12,314
What? What happened to the new Jerry?

326
00:20:12,315 --> 00:20:13,828
He doesn't work here anymore.

327
00:20:16,116 --> 00:20:20,048
Oh, well that's just *great!*
I love you, Jerry.

328
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:22,740
Right back at ya, Slick.

329
00:20:26,876 --> 00:20:29,380
You know, all these years,

330
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:33,331
I've always wanted to see the
two of you get back together.

331
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:36,196
Well, that's because you're an idiot.

332
00:20:46,091 --> 00:20:48,981
You single-handedly
brought Costanza and Son

333
00:20:48,982 --> 00:20:50,779
to the brink of bankruptcy.

334
00:20:50,931 --> 00:20:53,729
Well what about all the Lloyd Braun sales?
He's crazy.

335
00:20:53,730 --> 00:21:00,595
His phone wasn't even hooked up.
He just liked ringing
that bell.

336
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:06,723
I told you to clean out this garage.
I have to put my car in!

337
00:21:06,852 --> 00:21:09,860
This is a place of business.
I told you never to come in here.

338
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:13,538
Serenity now!
All right...

339
00:21:16,915 --> 00:21:20,526
Dad, you really should lay off
the 'serenity now' stuff.

340
00:21:20,607 --> 00:21:24,457
So, what am I supposed to say?
'Hoochie mama'?

341
00:21:27,106 --> 00:21:30,090
Move your crap,
I'm comin' in!

342
00:21:32,561 --> 00:21:38,834
No you're not! Hoochie mama!
Hoochie mama!
