1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:02,600
Cup of tea with lemon.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:03,500
What happened to your voice?

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,500
I was screaming at hecklers all night. 
The last time I open for a rodeo.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,000
Well, Jerry, I been thinking. 

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,400
I've gotten as far as I can go 
with George Costanza.

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,500
Is this the suicide talk 
or the nickname talk?

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,100
The nickname. 

8
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,500
George. What is that? 
It's nothing. 

9
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,400
It's got no snap, no zip.

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,100
I need a nickname 
that makes people light up.

11
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,500
You mean like...
Liza!

12
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,300
But I was thinking...

13
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,000
T-bone.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,800
But there's no "T" in your name. 
What about G-bone?

15
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,400
There's no G-bone.

16
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,400
There's a G-spot.

17
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,800
That's a myth.

18
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,800
T-bone, the ladies 
are gonna love ya.

19
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,300
Why did they hire you for a rodeo?

20
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,200
They heard I opened 
for Kenny Rogers once.

21
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,800
Didn't he throw you off a bus 
in the middle of Alabama?

22
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,600
Oh, I had that coming to me.

23
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,600
You know, Kenny Rogers has a--

24
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,100
Why did you get a maid?

25
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:10,100
You don't have to whisper. 
She knows she's a maid.

26
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,000
Where did you get her?

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,800
I hired her from a service!

28
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,800
All done.

29
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,300
Thank you. Nice job.

30
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:18,900
Is this mine?

31
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,900
Yeah.

32
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,000
What?

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,800
Come on, Jerry. 
You didn't notice?

34
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,100
Notice what? 

35
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,600
She's not really even a maid.

36
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,300
Oh.

37
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,100
She wants to be an actress.

38
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,900
Or a, uh, model...

39
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,400
or a dancer...

40
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,200
or a... news woman.
- News woman, uh-huh.

41
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,500
Hey. 

42
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,400
Well, bad news, boys. 

43
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,800
My life is over. 
My girlfriend's moving away.

44
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,000
You have a girlfriend?

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,400
Jerry, where have you been?

46
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,400
At a rodeo. 

47
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,700
Where's she moving?

48
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,100
Downtown.

49
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,300
Downtown New York?

50
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:05,300
Yeah. I don't know if I can handle 
one of these long-distance relationships.

51
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,000
It's like 10 minutes by subway.

52
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I don't know.

53
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,900
Well, you've got a maid. 

54
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,900
It's a whole different world downtown.

55
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,200
Different Gap, different Tower Records--

56
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,300
And she's a 646.

57
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,400
What? What is that?

58
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,800
That's the new area code. 

59
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,200
They've run out of 212s, 
so all the new numbers are 646.

60
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,200
I was a 718 when I first moved here. 
I cried every night.

61
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,500
Listen. Heads up, Elaine. 

62
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,300
I'm gonna have to stop by later
and pick up a fax.

63
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,200
At work?

64
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,700
No. At your apartment.

65
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,100
I don't have a fax machine.

66
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,300
Here we go.

67
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,300
Well, now what are we gonna do? 

68
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,300
 See? This is why you should get 
a fax and a Xerox.

69
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,800
And a dead bolt.

70
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,000
Are you sure you don't have one? 

71
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,600
Because there's a lot of stuff 
in my apartment I've never seen.

72
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,100
Then maybe you have a fax machine.

73
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:59,100
You just blew my mind.

74
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,500
Let's order lunch.

75
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,600
Mary, I will have a chef's salad.

76
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,300
Turkey sandwich.

77
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,600
T-bone steak.

78
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,700
For lunch?

79
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,500
Well, I am just a T-bone kinda guy. 

80
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,700
Love that T-bone.

81
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,000
In fact, you might as well call me--

82
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,700
That sounds good. 
I'll have one, too.

83
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,400
Watkins, you're having a T-bone?

84
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,500
I love 'em.

85
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,500
Well, then we should call you T-bone.

86
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,900
Uh, no. No, we shouldn't.

87
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,200
T-bone!

88
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,200
T-bone! T-bone! T-bone! 
T-bone! T-bone! 

89
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Hello?

90
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,100
What?

91
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:59,100
<i>You have 57 messages. 
Message one...

92
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,700
<i>Message two...

93
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,600
<i>Message three...

94
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,300
<i>Hey, it's George. Listen, I-

95
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:14,200
<i>Message four...

96
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,200
Kramer!

97
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,400
Hello?

98
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,900
Well Cindy, the place looks great.

99
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,400
Thanks Jerry. 
Gotta run.

100
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,400
Ok, I'll see ya.

101
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:50,100
Hi, Elaine.

102
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,500
All right! 

103
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:02,700
Fooling around with your maid. 
That is a wise decision.

104
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:07,000
Elaine, do you think I would go 
willy-nilly into a situation 

105
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
so obviously fraught with 
potential complications?

106
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,900
You are paying a woman to 
come to your house and sleep with you.

107
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,000
No. I pay her to clean. 
The rest is--

108
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,900
What? A health plan?

109
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,900
I was going to say, 
"Being a good host."

110
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,600
But the point is,

111
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,400
we have our personal relationship, 
and we have our work relationship. 

112
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,700
They're separate and, I think, 
somewhat sophisticated.

113
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,800
So you consider this a relationship?

114
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,800
Yes, I do.

115
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,600
Oh. Have you been out?

116
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,300
Yes, we have.

117
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,800
Where did you go?

118
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,300
The store.

119
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,600
To get what?

120
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,100
Stuff.

121
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,300
Cleaning supplies?

122
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,100
And gum.

123
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:56,100
There's nothing more sophisticated than 
diddling the maid and then chewing some gum.

124
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,700
She's not a maid. 
She might be a news woman!

125
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,400
Hey. 

126
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,500
Well, I just saw Madeline off. 

127
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,500
Yeah. She's in a cab and--

128
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,500
on her way. 
I miss her already.

129
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:12,500
Hey, Kramer--

130
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,500
What was it you were having 
faxed to my house every 30 seconds?

131
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,300
Well, I signed up for 
a food delivery service.

132
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,300
"Now We're Cooking". 
That's a play on words. 

133
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,200
You know, they're faxing me 
the menus from some restaurants.

134
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,000
Which ones?

135
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,700
Well, all of them. 
It's the deluxe package.

136
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,500
So this is never gonna stop?

137
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,500
Well, it better not. 
Paid for the whole year. 

138
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,900
So, should I pick those up later?

139
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,900
You can pick 'em up right now.

140
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,000
I wonder if anyone knows he's here. 

141
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,800
If he just disappeared...

142
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,500
would anybody notice?

143
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,400
All right, miss Benes, all finished.

144
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,800
Here's your new number.

145
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,100
646? What is this?

146
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,400
That's your new area code.

147
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,800
I thought 646 was 
just for new numbers.

148
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,300
This is a new number.

149
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,300
No, no, no, no. 
It's not a new number. 

150
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,100
It's-- just a changed number. 

151
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,100
See? It's not different. 
It's the same, just-- changed.

152
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,700
Look. 
I work for the phone company. 

153
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,200
I've had a lot of experience 
with semantics, 

154
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,200
so don't try to lure me 
into some maze of circular logic.

155
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,700
You know, I could've killed you, 
and no one would've known.

156
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,700
I could've killed you, 
and no one would've known.

157
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,200
Kramer, you're still on the phone?

158
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,800
Madeline and I are watching Quincy together. 

159
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,600
Jerry, you know this comes on 
at the same time here as it does there?

160
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,800
Really? It's Tuesday here. 
What day is it there?

161
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,300
Jerry's teasing. 

162
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,800
Uh-oh! Commercial. 

163
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,600
Oh, you going to the bathroom? 
Yeah. I'll go, too.

164
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,600
Madeline stays here.

165
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,700
Hey, T-bone!

166
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,600
No. No T-bone.

167
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,400
No T-bone?

168
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,400
Hey, is that T-bone?!

169
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,100
No! There's no T-bone!

170
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,000
Well, why no T-bone?

171
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,100
Why no T-bone?

172
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:17,100
'Cause Neil Watkins from accounting 
is T-bone!

173
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,700
I'm back. 

174
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,500
Hey, you wanna play cards over the phone?

175
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,100
Oh, hey, uh, listen, Jerry, uh, 
laundry's piling up there. 

176
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:30,100
You might want to tell your girlfriend.

177
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,900
Your girlfriend is doing your laundry?

178
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:38,900
He's sleeping with his maid!

179
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,400
You're sleeping with the maid?

180
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,900
Yes.

181
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,900
I've done that. 
Did you ever eat an ostrich burger?

182
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:50,900
No.

183
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,300
You're probably one of those women 
who doesn't like to give out her number.

184
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,000
No, I'm not. 
Here you go.

185
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,300
646?

186
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,800
It's a new area code.

187
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,500
What area? 
New Jersey?

188
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,600
No, no. It's right here in the city. 

189
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,600
It's the same as 212. 
They just multiplied it by 3, 

190
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
and then they added one 
to the middle number. It's the same.

191
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:20,300
Do I have to dial a one first?

192
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm really kinda seeing somebody.

193
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Yeah? Well, so am I!

194
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,200
Excuse me. Can I talk to you 
for a second there, Watkins?

195
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,100
It's T-bone.

196
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,900
The thing is...

197
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,900
I'm supposed to be T-bone.

198
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,900
You're not a T-bone. 
You're a perfect George.

199
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:43,700
What? 
Now, you listen to me!

200
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,700
Hey, look at George. 
He's giving it to T-bone. 

201
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:52,700
He's jumping up and down 
like some kind of monkey. 

202
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,600
Hey, what was the name of that monkey 
that could read sign language?

203
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,600
All right, you can have T-bone. 
Stop crying.

204
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,300
I'm not crying. 

205
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,000
And I shouldn't have said that 
about your wife. 

206
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Please accept my apologies.

207
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,100
OK, everybody, uh...

208
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,700
I have an announcement to make. 

209
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,600
From now on, I will be known as--

210
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,600
Koko the monkey.

211
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,300
What?

212
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:34,300
Koko! Koko! Koko! 
Koko! Koko! Koko! 

213
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,000
Thank you both for being here.

214
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,100
Um, excuse me. 

215
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,600
I live in the building. 
Did something happen to Mrs. Krantz?

216
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,900
She passed.

217
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,200
Oh, I'm so sorry.

218
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,100
Thank you.

219
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,900
A quick question-- 

220
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:51,900
Did she by any chance 
have a 212 phone number?

221
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,100
I can't find my earring.

222
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,600
Oh, here it is.

223
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,200
Listen, can I borrow your suitcases?

224
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,500
Yeah. It's in your closet.

225
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,500
No, no, no. I looked.

226
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,600
They're behind my skis and my tennis racket.

227
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,300
Thanks, buddy.

228
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,500
Where you going?

229
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,800
Well, I'm getting out of town. 

230
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,900
I'm gonna visit Madeline for the weekend. 

231
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,300
You know, this place 
is looking kinda messy. 

232
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,400
What happened to Cindy?

233
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,500
Well, she's here. 
She just didn't get around to it.

234
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,100
Hi, Kramer.

235
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:23,100
Thanks, Jerry. 
Bye.

236
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,200
Now, what's the matter?

237
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,100
What did I just pay for?

238
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:34,100
Uh-oh. 
You're a john.

239
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,000
Koko?

240
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,400
Koko.

241
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,900
Well, it's probably 
the most intelligent ape there is.

242
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,200
Yeah. 

243
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,600
So, how's Cindy the maid?

244
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,600
Everything's going great 
except, basically, I'm paying for sex.

245
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,600
Tell me about it. 

246
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,000
I went out with this girl last week. 
First I had to pay for dinner, then--

247
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,400
No, George. 
She's coming over and not cleaning. 

248
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,100
It's like I'm seeing a prostitute.

249
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,300
How much you pay this maid?

250
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:04,900
40.

251
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,000
40? 
I'm paying 60 to my maid. 

252
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,900
She doesn't do laundry 
and I'm getting nothing. 

253
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:13,400
Once she pinched my ass, 
but I don't know what that was.

254
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,800
I don't know what this is.

255
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,400
Hey, hey, hey. 
Look at that.

256
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,700
Ooh.

257
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,300
Jerry, you wouldn't believe 
what it's like down there. 

258
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,300
Taxicab drivers are insane. 
You know, everybody is in a hurry.

259
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,300
I can't eat with you leaning over like this. 
Just look straight forward.

260
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,900
Well, now I can't see Jerry.

261
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,900
I look about the same.

262
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,600
What?

263
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,700
I was talking to him.

264
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,500
What?

265
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,000
Never mind.

266
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,600
Come on. What'd he say?

267
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,500
Never mind.

268
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,900
Jerry, come on. What'd you say?

269
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,200
What?

270
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,100
Come on. Where'd you go?

271
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,300
Go back.

272
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,200
Come on. What did you say?

273
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,900
I said, never mind.

274
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,700
Yeah. I know that.

275
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,500
I hate the counter.

276
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:53,900
Hey.

277
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,200
Hey.

278
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,700
I hate the counter.

279
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,400
Who's that?

280
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,400
Well, I got a 212 number 

281
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,600
from this little old lady 
in my building, Mrs. Krantz.

282
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,500
Oh, she didn't mind?

283
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,200
No. She died.

284
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,500
Hey, that's great.

285
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,500
What happened to Mrs. Krantz?

286
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,800
Elaine got a new number 
because she died.

287
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,700
Newman died?

288
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,200
What did he say?

289
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,500
Some new kind of pie.

290
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,500
I'll try a piece.

291
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,800
All right, who's down there?

292
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,300
Hey, there's a booth.

293
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,300
Hey, Elaine.

294
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,400
Oh, hi.

295
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,700
Did you hear about Newman?

296
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,500
What?

297
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,300
Hey.

298
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,000
So how's it going at work? 
They get tired of it?

299
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Oh, yeah.

300
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,300
Double zero?

301
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,300
It's "oo".

302
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,100
As in "oo oo ah ah."

303
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,400
Your nickname's Koko? 

304
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,200
One of the girls down at the maid service 
is named Coco.

305
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,000
Really? Coco?

306
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Yeah. Coco. 
That girl's all right.

307
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,700
You know, if I could get 
this Coco woman down to Kruger, 

308
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,600
they wouldn't be able 
to call me Koko anymore 

309
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,600
because Kruger would never allow 2 Kokos.

310
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,000
Sounds like he runs a real tight ship.

311
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,800
Say good-bye to Koko.

312
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,800
Good-bye, Koko.

313
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,200
Good-bye, Koko. 

314
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,500
Jerry, this relationship is killing me. 

315
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,300
The distance, the longing, 
the distance, the-- 

316
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:15,000
You know, I didn't realize it,
but I'm a needy person.

317
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,800
Kramer, maybe 
this relationship isn't for you.

318
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,100
Oh, yeah?

319
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,200
So what am I supposed to do, 
be more like you? 

320
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,200
All sealed up in here, 
emotionally unavailable, 

321
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,100
paying scrubwomen 
for sexual favors? 

322
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,300
No! Jerry, I won't be like you!

323
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:31,300
Never! I'll never be like you!

324
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,900
What was that?

325
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,600
I didn't hear anything.

326
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,400
All right, I'm taking off. 
- OK.

327
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,800
Aren't you forgetting something?

328
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,700
Oh, right! 

329
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:45,300
Hey, it was great seeing you again. 
I love your outfit.

330
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,500
No. My money.

331
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,700
For what?

332
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,900
For my maid services. 
You booked me for today.

333
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,300
But you didn't really do any work.

334
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,600
I made the bed.

335
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,900
But you took a nap in it.

336
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,000
So?

337
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,100
I thought that was kind of 
girlfriend bedmaking.

338
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,400
No. That was the maid.

339
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,500
Well, who took the nap?

340
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,200
The girlfriend.

341
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,300
$40 seems kind of steep 
for a nap.

342
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,300
So, what are you saying? 

343
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,700
That I'm a bad maid 
or some kind of a prostitute?

344
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:15,000
Ho, ho... ho! 

345
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Hold on. 
Let's keep this sophisticated.

346
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,800
You know, I don't think I want to be 
your girlfriend <i>or</i> your maid.

347
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,600
So is this a breakup/quitting?

348
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,000
Yeah. Don't ever call me 
or hire me again.

349
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,200
Oh, yeah? 

350
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,200
Well, then we're through! 
And you're fired!

351
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,000
Sign here.

352
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Yes! 212.

353
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,100
Hey, what happened to the guy 
I had last time?

354
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,900
Oh, you know, it's an odd thing. 

355
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,900
He went out on a job, never came back. 

356
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,900
Nobody knows what happened.

357
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,700
All right! 
I am back in the game.

358
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,900
Hello?

359
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,000
Gammy!

360
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
No. You got the wrong number, kid.

361
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,300
Gammy Krantz?
It's your grandson Bobby. 

362
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,400
Why haven't you called?

363
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,900
Oh...nuts.

364
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:05,900
Do you hate me 
'cause of my lazy eye?

365
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:09,900
No. It's just that I've been 
kind of buried over here.

366
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,900
So the kid doesn't know 
his grandmother is dead? G-5?

367
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:20,800
Hit. No, I guess his parents 
didn't want to tell him. B-2?

368
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,700
Miss.

369
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,400
He called 6 times yesterday. 

370
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,700
What a nightmare it must be 
to have a real family.

371
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,700
I wouldn't worry about it. 

372
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,800
B-6?

373
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,000
Hit. Uhh...
you sank my submarine.

374
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Elaine...

375
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,900
Hello?

376
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,200
<i>You have a collect call from--

377
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,500
<i>Hey, buddy, don't say no!

378
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,900
I accept.

379
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,900
I went down to Madeline's. 

380
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,800
I told her, 
"You gotta move, or it's over."

381
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,900
Well, what happened?

382
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,100
I think it's over. 

383
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,300
We had a big fight, 
she threw me out, 

384
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,500
I started walking, 
and now I'm lost downtown! 

385
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,300
I don't have any money. 
I don't recognize anybody. 

386
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:06,300
I miss home, and I don't even 
know how to get there.

387
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,100
What's around you?

388
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,200
I'm looking at Ray's Pizza. 
You know where that is?

389
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,400
Is it Famous Ray's?

390
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,800
No. It's Original Ray's.

391
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,400
Famous Original Ray's?

392
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,500
It's just Original, Jerry!

393
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,400
Well, what street are you on?

394
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,900
Hey, I'm on First and First. 

395
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,300
How can the same street 
intersect with itself? 

396
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,100
I must be at the 
nexus of the universe.

397
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,400
Just wait there. 
I'll pick you up.

398
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,700
And, Kramer--
 stay alive!

399
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,700
No matter what occurs, 
I will find you!

400
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,700
You Steinfeld?

401
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,500
Yeah.

402
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,900
My name is Maxwell.

403
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,600
I'm from "Maid To Order". 

404
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,300
It's a pun. 

405
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,300
I sent one of my girls 
over to your place.

406
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,000
Cindy.

407
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,500
She says she had 
a little problem with you. 

408
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,400
You didn't pay.

409
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,700
You know, she didn't really do 
what she was supposed to do.

410
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,100
Oh, yeah? 
She told me what you like. 

411
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,800
You're a little sickie, aren't you? 

412
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,000
Disinfectant on the blinds, 
vacuuming the couch--

413
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,700
Hey, come on. Come on. 
I gotta live around here.

414
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,900
You know what I do to 
people who stiff me on a job?

415
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,100
What?

416
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,100
Well, it kinda depends 
on the situation.

417
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,200
But if I don't get my money from you, 
I'm gonna get it from her.

418
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,700
I don't want her in trouble. 
You want the money? Here.

419
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,100
Hey! Wait, wait, wait! Whoa! 

420
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,900
Give it to the girl. 

421
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:19,900
I'm an independent contractor. 
Tax purposes.

422
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,200
Bobby, you gotta stop 
calling your Gammy. 

423
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,800
Why? 

424
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,100
Because sometimes you call 
very early in the morning 

425
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:34,100
when Gammy has been out late 
the night before, 

426
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,500
and sometimes 
when Gammy's not alone. 

427
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,500
Your parents still haven't said 
anything to you about your Gammy? 

428
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:46,500
 All right, here we go. 

429
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,500
 Gammy doesn't feel so good. 

430
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,300
I think Gammy might be dying. 

431
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,400
Yep. Yep. 

432
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,900
OK. Good-bye, Bobby. 

433
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,500
Don't call anymore. 

434
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,500
I'm dead now. Gotta go.

435
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,500
9-1-1.

436
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,900
Nexus of the universe. 

437
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:11,100
Hey!

438
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,000
Cindy. Cindy.

439
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,900
What do you want?

440
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,400
Here. I got your money.

441
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,900
I don't want any money from you.

442
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:21,800
Come on. Take it. 
It's money. Let me give it to ya.

443
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,300
Looking for a good time, sir?

444
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:28,300
You wanna step out of the car, sickie?

445
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,600
Well, this is all 
very sophisticated.

446
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
All right, hang on, Gammy! 
You're gonna make it!

447
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,700
Hey, you look a little lost. 
You from around here?

448
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,800
Uh, no.

449
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,000
You know where you're going?

450
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,800
Not really. 

451
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,500
My friend was supposed to pick me up, 
but I don't know where he is.

452
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,800
Doesn't sound like much of a friend.

453
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,200
You got any money?

454
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,300
Uh, no.

455
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,200
You wanna make some?

456
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,900
OK.

457
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:06,000
Do you know how to use 
a mop wringer?

458
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,800
Yeah, yeah.

459
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,800
Why don't you get in the car?

460
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Hi. 

461
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
These are soft seats.

462
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,900
Hey, Koko, who's this?

463
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:35,700
This is our new 
Vice-president of Acquisitions, sir.

464
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,300
So you're just 
hiring new people now? 

465
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:43,300
That's your job, to hire people?

466
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,200
Yes.

467
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,200
OK, good enough for me, Koko.

468
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,600
Now, what's your name?

469
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,500
My name is Coco. 
Coco Higgins.

470
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,500
Coco?

471
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,700
We can't have 2 Cocos.

472
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,600
So I guess you're back to being George.

473
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,700
Well, it was a hell of a ride.

474
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:06,500
All right, the Grace building. 

475
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,500
There's a big stain on the front. 
How do we get it off?

476
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,000
When I was a little girl in Jamaica,

477
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,800
my Gammy taught me 
to take a wet rag and in a circ--

478
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,800
Ah, excuse me, Vice-president Coco, 
no one cares about your Gammy.

479
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,000
What did you say about my Gammy?

480
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Forget Gammy.

481
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,700
Who's Gammy?

482
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,100
There's no Gammy.

483
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,300
Maybe there should be a Gammy.

484
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,000
Oh, no.

485
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
George.

486
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,700
Gammy! Gammy! Gammy! 
Gammy! Gammy! Gammy! Gammy!

487
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:40,700
Gammy's getting upset!
