1
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,700
So, Elaine, 
are you going to sleep with me or what?

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,800
George, I just got off 
a twenty-three hour plane ride. 

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,100
I'm too tired to even vomit at the thought.

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,500
Fine. I'll ask you again 
when you're rested.

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,900
Oh, I'm sure she'll come around.

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,300
Yeah, I hope so. For your sake!

7
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,600
I said I was sorry.

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,600
You can stuff you sorries in a sack, mister!

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,900
Would you please stop saying that?!

10
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:29,700
What's up with you two?

11
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,400
I don't want to talk about it.

12
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,400
So how was the big trip?

13
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,300
I don't want to talk about it!

14
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,200
Well, what happened to your nose?

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,900
I don't want to talk ab-ow!-t it! 

16
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,000
Well, you gotta give me something! 

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,800
Come on, how was the wedding? 
Was the bride radiant?

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,500
She.. was.

19
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,700
'Till she found out Elaine slept with the groom.

20
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,800
Ooohh. 
That sounds juicy. 

21
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,200
Listen, I gotta go to the bathroom, 
but I want to hear all about it. 

22
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,200
You know, I didn't go to the bathroom 
the entire time we were in India.

23
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,200
I can't believe we went all the way to India 
for a wedding!

24
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,000
That's it! 
The wedding's off.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,400
What? 
But, Sue Ellen -

26
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,000
Elaine, you were my maid of honor 
and you slept with my Pinter?!

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,500
No, no, no! 
It was years ago - before you met him. 

28
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,800
And, and I got to tell you - 
it was very mechanical.

29
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,100
I have never been so humiliated!

30
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,300
Idiots! This is all your fault!

31
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,000
Not me! Him! His fault! He betrayed me!

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,100
George, I'm sorry..

33
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,400
You can stuff your sorries in a sack, Mister!

34
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,500
I don't know what that means.

35
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,800
Alright, Nina, you have to decide right now. 

36
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,200
Jerry or me?

37
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,700
Alright.. Neither.

38
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,000
What?! 

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,200
Well, what are you doing here?

40
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,900
A free trip to India. 

41
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,900
And by the way, you can take off those boots. 
Everyone knows you're 5'6".

42
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,000
5'8"! 

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
5'7"!

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,400
See? See the way they are?! 

45
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,500
We're - we're still best friends, right?

46
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,200
No.  

47
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,500
And take that stupid thing out of your nose!

48
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,100
That's got to hurt, 
I don't care where you're from!

49
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,100
What time is our flight back? 
I got to go to the bathroom.

50
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,200
Hey.
- Hey.

51
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,000
What happened last night?

52
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,300
Oh, you were pretty loaded.

53
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,200
I know. I woke up with this.

54
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,200
Oh. Hello, Tetanus.

55
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,600
George, I've used the bathroom. 
3It's fine.

56
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,700
No, no, no, no. 
I can walk it off. 

57
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,700
It's a hundred and twenty degrees in here. 
I'll sweat it out.

58
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,100
Hey. 

59
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,200
Are those Timberlands...

60
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,200
painted black?

61
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,700
Is your nose pierced?

62
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,800


63
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,300
Yeah.  Sit down there. 

64
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,700


65
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,800
I believe you know Nina.

66
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,100
George, we need to talk.

67
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,900
I think you've done a lot more than talk! 
You betrayed me!

68
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,400
Alright, I admit it. 
I slept with Nina, but that's all.

69
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,800
"That's all"?! That's everything! 

70
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,300
I don't know what all the rest of it 
is for anyway!

71
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,400
I'm really sorry.

72
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,800
You can stuff your sorries in a sack, mister!

73
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,500
Where'd you get that one?

74
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,200
It's an expression.

75
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,200
Hey! Shhh!

76
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,400
Look, we are gonna settle this right now! 

77
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,000
I demand reparations! 

78
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,100
I should get to sleep with Elaine. 
That's the only way to punish you!

79
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,700
That doesn't punish me. 
It punishes Elaine! 

80
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,900
And cruelly, I might add.

81
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,400
Funny guy!

82
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,600
Hey! Monkeys! 
Knock it off. 

83
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,100
My best friend 
is trying to get married up here!

84
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,100
Elaine, you have to sleep with me.

85
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,600
I'm not gonna sleep with you.

86
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,600
Reparations!

87
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,800
Would you grow up, George?! 

88
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,900
What is the difference? 

89
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,700
Nina slept with  him, he slept with me, 
I slept with Pinter. 

90
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,300
Nobody cares! It's all ancient history.

91
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:53,300
You slept with the groom?!

92
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Oh, thank you, FDR!

93
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,500
I stuck a rock in there too.
- I felt that.

94
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,800
Alright, FDR. 
This wish is for all the marbles. 

95
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,100
You win, you get your wish - 
I drop dead. 

96
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,900
I win, I don't drop dead, 

97
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,900
and I get one-hundred percent 
anti-drop-dead protection. Forever.

98
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,000
Alright.

99
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,900
Oh, man! 

100
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,400
Well, then, come on. 

101
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,000
There's got to be something 
that'll change your mind, FDR. 

102
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Something...

103
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,200
What, you want my kidney? 

104
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,700
Mama!..

105
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,800
George knows that you slept with Nina. 
That's why he was acting so weird.

106
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,900
How did he find out?

107
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,600
He schnapped me.

108
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,600
You know you're not supposed to drink 
while you're keeping a secret! 

109
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,500
Is there anything else?

110
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,000
I can't tell you.

111
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Here, drink this.

112
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,700
I slept with the groom.

113
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,700
Pinter?

114
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,300
He used to be called Peter.

115
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,900
So? Who cares about that?

116
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,100
Sue Ellen! 

117
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,400
If she knew, 
she'd call off the whole wedding.

118
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,700
Oh, nobody's calling off any weddings. 

119
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,800
Alright, it's time to go. 

120
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,800
Come on. Up.

121
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,200
Do you know what 'Jerry' is in Indian?

122
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,700
No, what?

123
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,400
Jugdish.

124
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,700
Yes, jugdish.

125
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:59,700
Hey, what if I got my nose pierced? 

126
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,600
That would be pretty freaky.

127
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,000
Yes, I think it's a fine idea. 

128
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Well, good night. 

129
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:18,100
Good night, Jugdish!

130
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,300
Bless you.

131
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,300
Thank you..

132
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,200
Hello FDR.

133
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,200
I'll have a hot one, everything on it.

134
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,300
These things will kill you.

135
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,800
But so what? You're already gonna drop dead.

136
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,900
Well, guess what, FDR? 

137
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:47,900
I made a wish on a shooting star last night, 
and I wished against your wish.

138
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,600
That's funny. 

139
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,600
As it happens, I saw the same shooting star, 
and I double-wished you to drop dead.  

140
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,200
Here's your change.

141
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,700
Alright, I'm triple-wishing! 

142
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,000
Yep!

143
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Then I'm quadruple-wishing!

144
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,600
Alright -

145
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,800
how do you like this?

146
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,800
I like it a lot.  

147
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,700
Oh, God, it's so hot!  

148
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,300
What is that smell?

149
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,100
I think it's the stench of death.

150
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,800
George, you've been wearing those boots 
since I met you. 

151
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,300
You're not gonna wear them to the wedding, 
are you?

152
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,300
No.. I'm gonna wear black shoes.

153
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,500
Oh boy. There's Sue Ellen. 

154
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,500
She didn't want me at this wedding, 
but here I am with a bunch of my idiot friends!

155
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,300
This is gonna be great!

156
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:57,300
Elaine? Oh! Oh, I am so happy to see you!

157
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,900
You are?

158
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,400
Well, of course! 

159
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,700
No one else was even 
willing to come to India. 

160
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:07,000
I mean, not even Pinter's parents - 
and they're Indian.

161
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,100
Come on, Sue Ellen. 

162
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:11,500
You don't wear a bra, you're tall -
 we hate each other!

163
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,500
Elaine, I know. 
I know we've had our problems, but -

164
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:20,100
I want you to be my maid of honor - 
and my best friend.

165
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,100
Huh.. alright. I guess.

166
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,000
Uh, this is my fiance, Pinter. 

167
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,300
Say hello.

168
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,600
Hello.

169
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,800
Peter?

170
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,400
Uh, no. It's Pinter. 

171
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,200
Does anyone want to use the bathroom?

172
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,600
Oh, no. No. We're good. 

173
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,900
Let's get goin'. Alright. 

174
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,700
Watch it, funny man!

175
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,900
Elaine, have you noticed 
George was acting strange the whole flight?

176
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,800
No. What? Like what? 
What? Strange... No. I...

177
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,800
Look what they had on the plane. 
Schnapps.

178
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,600
Ooohh.

179
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,300
Come on.. Come on. 

180
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,700
Yes!  
There's one!

181
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,900
I wish I don't drop dead!!

182
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,800
Hey, shut up up there!

183
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,800
You shut up!

184
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,800
Aw, drop dead!

185
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,000
Hello, friend. 
Enjoying the flight?

186
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,900
Coach to India - The only way to go.

187
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,500
Good one. Very funny. 

188
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,500
You're very funny, Jerry. 
That's what I always tell people. 

189
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,200
Jerry Seinfeld's a funny guy!

190
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:28,900
You all right?

191
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:32,900
Of course I'm all right. 
I'm here with my girl. Nina. 

192
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:37,100
And what better way to pass the time 
than gabbing with my best friend,

193
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,600
with whom there are no secrets. 

194
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,300
Like this. Since fourth grade.

195
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,200
Hey, didn't I beat you up 
in the fourth grade?

196
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,700
Funny guy!

197
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,600
Right here!

198
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,600
By the way, you never said anything 
to George about Jerry and me, did you?

199
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,400
Oh please.
It's in the vault.

200
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,400
Ho, ho! Jerry Seinfeld's a funny guy!

201
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,100
Hey, what time is it?

202
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:11,000
You just asked me two minutes ago.

203
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,700
Hey, what time is it?

204
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,200
I'm not wearing a watch.

205
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,600
Is this tooth chipped?

206
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,300
Yeah. How'd you do that?

207
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,100
I have no idea.

208
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,100
Watch this. 

209
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:34,100
Oh, God.

210
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,000
So, Jerry and Nina, huh?

211
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,100
Oh, m-m. 

212
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,100
I'm not gonna tell you any more things.

213
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,600
You already told me everything.

214
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,600
Okey-dokey.

215
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,100
I mean, we had a deal, Newman. 

216
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,300
You were supposed to 
give my your birthday wish. 

217
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,900
And now you've wasted it!

218
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,300
Did I?

219
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,500
Newman, I'm bored.

220
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,500
Aww.

221
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,200
Does your girlfriend have to be here?

222
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,500
Does yours?

223
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,800
I'm just hanging out in this hellhole
because of George.

224
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,400
Alright, come on, Newman. Now you gotta help me! 

225
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,500
What am I gonna do about FDR?

226
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,700
Why don't you just make another wish?

227
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,700
And how am I gonna do that, Toots?

228
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,100
What about a shooting star?

229
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,500
That's perfect.

230
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,500
Beauty... and brains.

231
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,500
Oh, come on. 
You know he's a postman, don't ya?

232
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,600
Here's your plane ticket.

233
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,700
What are you talking about?

234
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,700
Sue Ellen sends me an invitation 
one week before her wedding in India.

235
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,000
I'll show her.

236
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,600
By flying halfway around the world?

237
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,900
Spite never sleeps!

238
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:50,400
Wish you wouldn't have gotten a layover in Sarajevo.

239
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,200
Hey.

240
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,000
Here. You're going to India with us tomarrow.

241
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,700
For how long?

242
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,300
Three days.

243
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,000
Great.  

244
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,400
Jerry, I gotta tell you, I had the best time with that Nina last night. 

245
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,600
I think I'm in love with her already. 

246
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,600
You are a great friend. A great, great friend.

247
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,500
Hey, Kramer, what are you doing? 

248
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,700
You want to borrow something? You want to eat something? Come on in!

249
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,800
You want to go to India?

250
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,300
I can't.  I'm gonna drop dead!

251
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,000
Great! Nina could go, huh? 

252
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,900
Jerry, this is great. You and Elaine. Me and Nina..

253
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,200
Hey, Kramer, wait up. I'll go with you.

254
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,200
I'm goin' to Newman's!

255
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,800
Great, I love Newman!

256
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,600
Jerry seem a little weird when I mentioned Nina?

257
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,000
Nina? Nina? No. Psshhh.. Not weird. No. Nina.

258
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,200
Why do you keep saying Nina?

259
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,200
I don't know. Nina. Nina!  

260
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,700
I'm gonna go grab a bite.

261
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:40,700
Uhh.. I'll meet you down there. 

262
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,800
Cereal, cereal -

263
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,400
Peach schnapps.

264
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,400
Come on, Lomez! We're gonna be late for the movie.

265
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,400
You see, my dear, all certified mail is registered, 
but registered mail is not necessarily certified.

266
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,300
I could listed to you talk about mail all day.

267
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,200
Anything you wish.. 

268
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,200
I'll tell you a little secret about ZIP codes: 
They're meaningless! 

269
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Wish?! Newman!

270
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,600
Lomez, I'm leaving!

271
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,500
..And you smell like one, too.

272
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,200
Make a wish, Newman! 
We've gotta get back to work in three hours!

273
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,500
Newman, wait!

274
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,300
Kramer! 
I'm with people.

275
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,900
Yeah, yeah. 
And thanks for inviting me!

276
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,500
I did invite you.

277
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,500
Your invitation must've gotten - 
lost in the mail.

278
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,000
Well, Newman, I need your wish 
to protect me from FDR.

279
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,700
Can't do it. 
I'm on an unbelievable birthday-wish hot streak! 

280
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,700
My last five birthday wishes came true.

281
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,300
Come on! 
Look, I'll give you my next birthday wish, huh?

282
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,100
Your next.. fifty wishes.

283
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,000
Forty-eight.

284
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,700
Fourty-nine.

285
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,900
Done!

286
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,500
Sucker.

287
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,500
Alright, alright, back, savages. 
Back! I haven't made my wish yet..

288
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,600
Well, this Mischke mish-mash is just gettin' worse.

289
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,200
I talked with the groom's parents

290
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,300
and it's so obvious that they don't want me to go.

291
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,000
And the only reason she sent me an invitation 
was that so I'd send her a gift.

292
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,100
Jerry?

293
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,300
Uh, well, you know, 
a coffee grinder is nice. 

294
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,900
Or a coffee maker. Everyone likes coffee. 
Anything to do with coffee. 

295
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,600
Maybe you should go get some coffee.

296
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,000
Oh. Hi.

297
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,400
Hi.

298
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,400
Oh, I should.. um..

299
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,900
Sure.

300
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,900
Bye.
- Bye-bye. 

301
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,400
Who else ya got back there?

302
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,400
Look, there was an awkward moment in the conversation. 
It never happened before.

303
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,300
You slept with Nina? 
What are you gonna tell George?

304
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,700
Nothing. And neither will you. 

305
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,400
George can never know about this. 
It'll crush him.

306
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,900
Uh. Alright, alright. 
I'll put it in the vault.

307
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,100
No good. 
Too many people know the combination.

308
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,600
What combination?

309
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,100
Don't be ridiculous.

310
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,400
Oh my god. 
This drawer is filled with Fruit Loops!

311
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,900
So what?

312
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,900
And milk.

313
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,000
Oh, geez.

314
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Hello?

315
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,800
Hi. 
Mr and Mrs Ranawat?

316
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,500
Please, call us Usha and Zubin.

317
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,300
Oh. 
Well, Usha...

318
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,200
I'm Zubin.

319
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,200
Anyway, your son is marrying 
my friend, Sue Ellen Mischke...

320
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,400
You're not going to the wedding, are you?

321
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:52,900
Well...

322
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:56,900
Don't go. 
India is a dreadful, dreadful place.

323
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,700
You know, it's the only country 
that still has the plague? 

324
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:04,500
I mean, the plague! Please!

325
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,900
Here's the registry. 

326
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:09,500
Send her a gift, 
and be glad you did not have to go.

327
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,500
Right. Don't go. Send a gift. 

328
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,600
I think I understand.

329
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,600
If I had to go to India, 
I wouldn't go to the bathroom the entire trip.

330
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,000
That's fantastic.

331
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
And I'm not so crazy about Manhattan, either.

332
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,500
Oh, you were going to tell me all about George.

333
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,100
Ah, just remember when you see him tomorrow night 
to tell him that the waiter liked him.

334
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,700
Really?

335
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:39,200
Believe me. 
You know, I forgot how much fun it is hanging out with you.

336
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,000
I know. 
You know, we never had a bad conversation.

337
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,200
I know. No awkward pauses. 

338
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,900
Probably the reason we never fooled around.

339
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,900
Heh... yeah.

340
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:54,700
Probably the reason...

341
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Are - are you dense? 
I said I wanted you to drop dead. Now.. drop dead! 

342
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,100
I knew it. 
Stupid Jerry.

343
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,900
Kramer, I know what I'm talking about. 
There's no way FDR wants you to drop dead.

344
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:24,800
But you haven't seen...
- Just go back and ask him again. 

345
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,800
That's right. 
My birthday wish was that you drop dead.

346
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,000
Well, why?

347
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,600
I have my reasons.

348
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,500
Woah, wait, wait, wait. 

349
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,500
If you make a birthday wish out loud, 
it doesn't come true.

350
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:39,500
That's just a silly superstition. 

351
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:46,300
Hey, FDR wants me to drop dead.

352
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,100
FDR?

353
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,100


354
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:53,100
I go to his birthday party, 
and just before he blew out his candles, he gives me this look...

355
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,800
Stink eye?

356
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,700
Crook eye?

357
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,400
<i>Evil</i> eye.

358
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,400
Well, everybody's a little cranky on their birthday.

359
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,500
Oh, it's a bad day. 

360
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,200
You got everyone in your house, 
you're thinking, "these are my friends?"

361
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,000
Everyday is my birthday.

362
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I can't have this hanging over my head. 
It's bad mojo.

363
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,300
Hi.

364
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,300
You're not gonna believe 
what I got in the mail. 

365
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,600
Invitation to Sue Ellen Mischke's wedding.

366
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,200
Well, at least the wedding gown 
will give her some support.

367
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,600
Not the point. 

368
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,600
The wedding is in one week. 
I got this today.

369
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,700
So you think it's a non-vite?

370
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,800
It's an un-vitation!  

371
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,400
Hey, are you gettin' taller?

372
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,600
Timberlands.

373
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,000
Ah.  

374
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,900
Hey, look at this. 

375
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,900
'Pinter Ranawat'. 
I wonder if he's related to that guy I dated, Peter Ranawat..

376
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,800
Ah, it's probably like Smith over there.

377
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,600
Jerry, would you make the call already?

378
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,300
What call?

379
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,600
He wants me to set him up 
with this girl, Nina Stengal.

380
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,200
Oh, the great conversation girl. 

381
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,500
The one you think can replace me?

382
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,600
I was kidding when I said that!

383
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,500
Told me the same thing.

384
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,900
Nina, Hi. It's Jerry.

385
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,400
You-you sure you never slept with her?  

386
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,600
Perfect.

387
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,300
Hey, how 'bout my friend, George? 
Quite a guy, huh?

388
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,300
Ooh.. Something's not sitting right..

389
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,800
I'll have the clams Casino.

390
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,900
Get outta here.

391
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,600
"Chef recommends"

392
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,500
I think she likes me.

393
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,000
Sure.

394
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
So, how come nothing ever happened 
between you and Nina?  

395
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,400
Is there a problem with her? 
Is she a man?

396
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,300
Are you?

397
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,700
Well, what's the reason?

398
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,800
We were too compatible. 
Our conversations were so engrossing.

399
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,900
How engrossing?

400
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:30,900
If we ever had a problem with Elaine, 
we could bring in Nina and not lose a step.

401
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:36,900
You don't, huh, have a replacement 
lined up for me, do ya?

402
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,300
Anyway, like I was saying, 
I couldn't make the trasition from conversation to sex. 

403
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,700
There were no awkward pauses.
I need an awkward pause.

404
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,500
I'm all awkward pauses. 
Fix me up with her. 

405
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,100
Wait a minute, 
Nina just saw me in my Timberlands! 

406
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,800
Now I have to wear them 
every time I see her.

407
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,700
Why?

408
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,300
In any other shoe, 
I lose two inches. 

409
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,100
I can't have a drop down. 

410
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,900
We were eye to eye, 
I can't go eye to chin!

411
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,600
So, you're gonna wear them 
no matter what the situation?

412
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,600
In every situation. 
No matter how silly I look. 

413
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,500
Hm... tastes a little funky.

414
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,500
Oh, I'm sure it's fine.

415
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,100
...to you!

416
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:14,800
Come on, make a wish! Make a wish!

417
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,800
Yeah!

418
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,900
Ah, this is the kind of day 
that almost makes you feel good to be alive.

419
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,400
Almost. 

420
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,300
Hey, new Timberlands?

421
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,700
Yeah, and a whole new me. 
I'm up two inches in these babies!

422
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,300
Really?

423
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:39,300
Five' eight. Five' seven.

424
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:39,800
Jerry?

425
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,000
Nina?
- Hi.

426
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,200
It's been years!
- Yeah!

427
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,300
George, this is Nina.

428
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:47,300
Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

429
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,500
India? 

430
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:59,500
Yeah, right.  
I'm going to India.

431
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,300
And they call it the World Wide Web. 
You can e-mail anyone!

432
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,000
What are you, a scientist?!

433
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,400
Ah, I gotta go. 
- Ah.

434
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,100
It's great talkin'.

435
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,500
Great talkin' to you.  

436
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,800
What the hell is e-mail?

437
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,900
How was the date?

438
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:25,900
Pretty good. I think she might be the one.
- No.

439
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,500
Oh, French fries.

440
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,800
Fat, George.

441
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,900
Baked, uh, potato.

442
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,700
Sorry.

443
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,400
Yeah, you stuff your sorries in a sack, mister.

444
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,400
Hey, hey. 

445
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,400
Yeah, check it out. 
It's packin' tight! 

446
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,600
What are you bringing snowballs in here for?

447
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,100
I need some water. 
Ice it up nice and hard. 

448
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,000
And when you throw it - 

449
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,600
Oh look,  there's my friend, FDR. 

450
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,000
I'm gonna nail him in the back of the head. 

451
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It's gonna be great! 

452
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,600
Hi, Elaine.
- Hey!

453
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,600
Hey, let's go someplace else, 
okay, Peter?

454
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,300
Oh, hey, how you doing?

455
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,900
Oh, hi. I-I'm Jerry Seinfeld. 
I'm movin' in. 

456
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,000
I saw your name on the buzz. 
You must be Kessler.

457
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,300
Uh, no. 
Actually, it's Kramer.

458
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,500
You need any help, or...?

459
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,400
No, thanks. 

460
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,400
But I ordered a pizza. 
You want some of it?

461
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,800
Uh, no, no, no. 
I couldn't impose.

462
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,800
Why not? We're neighbors. 
What's mine is yours. 

463
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,800
Really?

464
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,800
<i>Good night, Jugdish!</i>
