1
00:00:03,949 --> 00:00:06,976
Any second now. Light is on

2
00:00:06,977 --> 00:00:10,925
Light is on! waffles are ready.

3
00:00:11,204 --> 00:00:14,468
Oh, fantastic! I'm starving.

4
00:00:14,995 --> 00:00:18,755
How about that.

5
00:00:26,978 --> 00:00:29,167
She ate breakfast naked?

6
00:00:29,168 --> 00:00:31,269
She didn't even want a napkin.

7
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:35,307
I've had bedroom naked, I've had
walk- to-the-bathroom naked...

8
00:00:35,308 --> 00:00:37,307
I have never had living-room naked.

9
00:00:38,557 --> 00:00:41,985
Oh, it's a scene.
- It's
like you're livin' in the Playboy

10
00:00:41,986 --> 00:00:44,871
Mansion! Did she, uh, did
she did she frolic?

11
00:00:45,326 --> 00:00:47,381
I don't really have enough room.

12
00:00:48,141 --> 00:00:50,333
Yeah. Hey, Lainie, Puddy.

13
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:56,715
Back together?
- His apartment
was being fumigated,

14
00:00:56,716 --> 00:00:59,037
so we thought we'd give
it another shot.

15
00:00:59,038 --> 00:01:02,163
So guess who called me
last night? Jason Hanke.

16
00:01:02,164 --> 00:01:05,019
'Stanky Hanke'? What did he want?

17
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,153
He called to apologize for standing

18
00:01:07,154 --> 00:01:09,427
me up five years ago.
- Why now?

19
00:01:09,807 --> 00:01:12,090
A.A. It's one of the Twelve Steps.

20
00:01:12,091 --> 00:01:13,999
Step number Nine is you have to

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,645
apologize to anyone
you've ever wronged.

22
00:01:17,002 --> 00:01:21,860
Ho ho ho ho! I can't wait for
Hanke to come crawling back to me.

23
00:01:21,861 --> 00:01:24,719
Still with the neck hole?
- Still upset. Very upset.

24
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,214
What neck hole?

25
00:01:26,215 --> 00:01:28,640
Remember that New Year's
party he threw a few years ago? He

26
00:01:28,641 --> 00:01:31,388
had that very drafty apartment, you
know, I think on Ninth Avenue.

27
00:01:31,389 --> 00:01:32,095
Faster.

28
00:01:32,096 --> 00:01:35,320
I asked if I could borrow a sweater.

29
00:01:35,321 --> 00:01:39,525
A cashmere sweater.
- I said
preferably cashmere, , for warmth.

30
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:42,991
So in front of the
whole party, he says, 'No. I

31
00:01:42,992 --> 00:01:45,808
don't want you
stretching out the neck hole.'

32
00:01:46,736 --> 00:01:49,101
Oh, yeah, sure, laugh it
up. Everybody else did!

33
00:01:49,559 --> 00:01:51,897
Well, it's funny. I
mean, you have a big head.

34
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:56,333
Or is it 'cause of your neck?

35
00:01:56,748 --> 00:01:59,345
No, I think the head does
most of the stretching.

36
00:01:59,346 --> 00:02:02,273
Regardless. I had to walk
around for the rest

37
00:02:02,274 --> 00:02:05,315
of the party in some cheap
Metlife windbreaker.

38
00:02:05,316 --> 00:02:07,100
Now, it is payback time.

39
00:02:07,101 --> 00:02:09,700
I really think it's the size
of your neck.
- It's my head!

40
00:02:14,278 --> 00:02:17,182
Isn't this great? With
those nerds in accounting

41
00:02:17,183 --> 00:02:20,609
moved, you and I are the
only ones who use this bathroom.

42
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,069
Yeah. Great.

43
00:02:30,123 --> 00:02:32,798
You went to the
coffee shop without me? I told

44
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:35,282
ya, I just wanted to hop in the shower.

45
00:02:35,741 --> 00:02:37,909
That was an hour ago. What were
you doing in there?
- Showering.

46
00:02:38,088 --> 00:02:40,546
How long does it take
you?
- Ten minutes.

47
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:43,753
Ten minutes? That's kooky talk.

48
00:02:44,714 --> 00:02:46,833
Hey Elaine, how long do
you spend in the shower?

49
00:02:47,235 --> 00:02:50,639
Ten minutes.
- Let me smell
you.
- All right. Whiff away.

50
00:02:53,733 --> 00:02:58,273
Uh... that's not bad at
all.
- Hup! That's it.

51
00:02:58,665 --> 00:03:01,699
So get this. I'm in
the bathroom at work today,

52
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,438
and I see Peggy using a seat protector.

53
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:07,256
So?
- So... we're the
only women on the floor.

54
00:03:07,256 --> 00:03:09,722
I mean, we're like roommates.
Would-would

55
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:12,798
you use a seat
protector if you had a roommate?

56
00:03:14,455 --> 00:03:17,279
I think the damage is
probably already done.

57
00:03:17,803 --> 00:03:22,510
All right! I'll get that. Well, maybe
she just practices good hygiene.

58
00:03:22,568 --> 00:03:24,889
Yeah, you're
probably right. She's probably

59
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,997
one of those neurotic clean freaks.

60
00:03:27,362 --> 00:03:31,613
Well, here's my shower routine.
Maybe I can make some changes.

61
00:03:31,614 --> 00:03:34,686
Get  wash cloth mittens and maybe some

62
00:03:34,687 --> 00:03:37,920
liquid soap, and
just... -pop- focus!

63
00:03:39,003 --> 00:03:41,722
Zephyr? That is not a word.

64
00:03:41,723 --> 00:03:44,057
Do you challenge?
- No, I do not challenge.

65
00:03:44,243 --> 00:03:46,401
66 points. Ha ha.

66
00:03:46,402 --> 00:03:49,682
I'd accuse you of cheating, but I
don't know where you'd hide the tiles.

67
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:52,409
You want some more ice tea?
- Sure.

68
00:03:56,137 --> 00:03:57,591
Wrong  pipe.

69
00:04:04,255 --> 00:04:07,821
So she coughed.
- Coughing... naked...

70
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:11,086
It's a turn-off, man.

71
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:13,846
Everything goes with naked.

72
00:04:13,948 --> 00:04:16,327
When you cough, there are thousands of

73
00:04:16,328 --> 00:04:19,657
unseen muscles that suddenly
spring into action.

74
00:04:19,808 --> 00:04:22,069
It's like watching that fat guy catch a

75
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,620
cannonball in his
stomach in slow motion.

76
00:04:25,661 --> 00:04:27,866
Oh, you spoiled, spoiled man.

77
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:30,280
Do you now how much mental
energy I expend

78
00:04:30,281 --> 00:04:32,556
just trying to picture women naked?

79
00:04:32,694 --> 00:04:36,489
But the thing you don't realize is
that there's good naked and bad naked.

80
00:04:36,617 --> 00:04:43,847
Naked hair brushing, good; naked
crouching, bad. Hey, there's Hanke.

81
00:04:43,848 --> 00:04:47,169
All right. It's grovel
time.
- Hey, George. Jerry.

82
00:04:47,531 --> 00:04:51,467
Listen, I just got sober, so I've
been going through the Twelve Steps.

83
00:04:51,468 --> 00:04:54,536
What are you up to now, uh, Step Nine?

84
00:04:55,325 --> 00:04:58,776
Yeah. Making amends.
- Important step.

85
00:04:58,777 --> 00:05:00,926
Maybe the most important.

86
00:05:01,515 --> 00:05:04,601
Anyway, uh, Jerry, you
know, this may sound dumb, but,

87
00:05:04,602 --> 00:05:07,997
you know, when we first met
I thought your name was Gary.

88
00:05:08,329 --> 00:05:11,429
And, I think I may even have
called you Gary a couple of times, and...

89
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:14,991
I don't know if you noticed, but I always
felt bad about it, so, I'm sorry.

90
00:05:15,013 --> 00:05:19,276
Thank you. I did notice, and
I appreciate you rectifying it.

91
00:05:19,761 --> 00:05:27,724
Great. Great. Well,
I'll see you guys later.

92
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:33,828
Well, I just got out
of a 27-minute shower.

93
00:05:33,829 --> 00:05:36,926
I made some good cuts, and I
didn't lose anything I needed.

94
00:05:36,927 --> 00:05:39,646
Yeah, I think what I
kept is even stronger now.

95
00:05:39,647 --> 00:05:42,149
You got some suds over here.

96
00:05:43,011 --> 00:05:46,565
Wha...? Oh, man! Geez!

97
00:05:47,436 --> 00:05:48,952
Look at that! I'm all lathery. Jerry,

98
00:05:48,953 --> 00:05:50,713
you got to show me
what I'm doing wrong.

99
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:53,576
Oh, come on!
- No, I
mean it, man. I'm lost!

100
00:05:53,685 --> 00:05:56,248
You promise you'll
never come in here again?

101
00:05:56,377 --> 00:05:58,496
Oh, Jerry, you know I can't do that.

102
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:02,275
Now my sense of it is that
you're probably wasting time

103
00:06:02,276 --> 00:06:04,723
working piecemeal, first cleaning
one area, then another.

104
00:06:04,724 --> 00:06:07,228
Well, that's how cats do it.

105
00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:11,724
But, when you have a faucet instead
of a tongue, you want to use gravity.

106
00:06:11,821 --> 00:06:14,208
OK. Let's turn the water on now. 

107
00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:16,936
No, I told you, it's just a dry run.

108
00:06:17,135 --> 00:06:19,742
Well, Hanke's moved on to Step Ten. He

109
00:06:19,743 --> 00:06:22,482
was spotted taking personal inventory.

110
00:06:22,483 --> 00:06:24,598
That's Step Ten?
- All
he has to do now is

111
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:27,058
count his blessings, say
a prayer, and he's done.

112
00:06:27,059 --> 00:06:28,300
Do you believe this?

113
00:06:28,394 --> 00:06:30,642
Come on, Jerry. How
about a-a baggy swimsuit?

114
00:06:30,643 --> 00:06:32,469
You're not gettin' any skin, Kramer.

115
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:36,485
Well, this has all been one big tease!

116
00:06:38,235 --> 00:06:42,176
These proofs look pretty
good. Oh. Can I move this?

117
00:06:45,049 --> 00:06:49,043
Yup. I think this will work.

118
00:06:49,414 --> 00:06:52,342
I'm... gonna  get
another bottle of water.

119
00:06:52,343 --> 00:06:55,075
Here, take mine.
There's a little left.

120
00:07:06,757 --> 00:07:10,022
Guys, there's no doubt
that the pay is good. But I don't

121
00:07:10,023 --> 00:07:13,015
just know if I see
myself working with ice cream.

122
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:17,233
You get pretty buff forearms.
- I don't know if I'm into that.

123
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,208
Oh, hello, Hanke, others.

124
00:07:20,548 --> 00:07:22,925
You know, Jason, I, uh, I couldn't

125
00:07:22,926 --> 00:07:24,245
help notice, I... I

126
00:07:24,246 --> 00:07:26,250
didn't get my  apology.

127
00:07:26,305 --> 00:07:29,162
Apology? For what?
- A drafty apartment?

128
00:07:29,174 --> 00:07:34,878
A... sweaterless friend? A ball-game
giveaway Metlife windbreaker?

129
00:07:35,016 --> 00:07:36,385
George, come on, not that neck

130
00:07:36,386 --> 00:07:37,710
hole thing.
- Yeah, the neck

131
00:07:37,711 --> 00:07:40,992
hole thing, and I would appreciate
it if you would  say you're sorry.

132
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:44,147
No way, you would've
completely stretched it out.

133
00:07:44,148 --> 00:07:49,799
You're an alcoholic! You have to
apologize. Step Nine! Step Nine.

134
00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:53,032
All right, George,
all right. I'm sorry.

135
00:07:54,473 --> 00:07:56,490
I'm very, very sorry. I'm so sorry that

136
00:07:56,491 --> 00:07:59,723
I didn't want your rather
bulbous head struggling to find its

137
00:07:59,724 --> 00:08:03,363
way through the normal-size
neck hole of my finely knit sweater.

138
00:08:12,641 --> 00:08:17,955
Now see, that's smart.
Constant motion. Wow.

139
00:08:18,935 --> 00:08:21,114
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I-I'm watching you, too. But

140
00:08:21,115 --> 00:08:23,256
this guy's really showing me something!

141
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:27,990
You got a steak?
- What happened to you?

142
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:31,022
Ah, people in this city
are crazy.
- Here ya go.

143
00:08:33,671 --> 00:08:37,189
Thanks, buddy. Oh... yes! Hey, you
got any A1, 'cause I'm cooking a steak.

144
00:08:37,264 --> 00:08:40,073
What?
- Yeah, a different one.

145
00:08:40,851 --> 00:08:43,278
OK, Jerry. I fixed that bike.

146
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,352
Oh. That wasn't really necessary.
I don't ride it. It's just for show.

147
00:08:46,696 --> 00:08:50,027
I should really clean those bearings.
Hold this. Look at all that gunk.

148
00:08:50,028 --> 00:08:53,715
Please don't crouch.
- Ouch! Caught my skin.

149
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:56,468
Oh, that's bad. Especially that area.

150
00:08:56,469 --> 00:09:00,538
You got anything to
snack on?
- Oh, pickles!

151
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:06,585
Unnhhhh! It's a tough one.

152
00:09:06,586 --> 00:09:10,525
Look, please stop! Let
me help you with that!

153
00:09:12,378 --> 00:09:14,993
Unnnnh! Oooh. That's gonna
leave a welt. Look at that.

154
00:09:15,418 --> 00:09:20,788
I can't. I can't look anymore.
I-I-I've seen too  much.

155
00:09:22,347 --> 00:09:27,802
Peggy, we've got to talk. What is it
about me that you find so  offensive?

156
00:09:27,918 --> 00:09:31,579
You seem to be with
a lot of men.
- What!?

157
00:09:31,998 --> 00:09:35,568
I happen to have a
very steady boyfriend.

158
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,461
You know, I mean,
we broke up a few times

159
00:09:38,462 --> 00:09:41,646
and there has been an
occasional guy here or...

160
00:09:42,054 --> 00:09:44,227
or there, but, wh-why
is this your business?

161
00:09:44,228 --> 00:09:46,894
It's not. Good day.

162
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:51,483
Oh. All right. You
think I've got germs?

163
00:09:51,484 --> 00:09:55,376
I'll give you some germs. How about
some for your keyboard, huh? Huh?

164
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:58,619
Oooh, how about for your stapler. Hmmm?

165
00:09:58,739 --> 00:10:04,033
That's good, isn't it? You
have a happy and a healthy.

166
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:13,037
Well, technically he did apologize.

167
00:10:13,062 --> 00:10:15,954
Jerry, I felt like a
straight man in some

168
00:10:15,955 --> 00:10:19,866
horrible sketch. He was riffing!
Riffing! On my pain!

169
00:10:19,867 --> 00:10:23,517
So now you want an apology for the
apology, plus the original apology?

170
00:10:23,518 --> 00:10:25,816
That's right. I'm two in the hole!

171
00:10:26,174 --> 00:10:29,098
Well, I hit the wall
yesterday with Lady Godiva.

172
00:10:29,099 --> 00:10:31,672
She did a full body
flex on a pickle jar.

173
00:10:32,176 --> 00:10:35,933
Did you explain to her about
the good naked and the bad naked?

174
00:10:35,934 --> 00:10:40,510
Where am I gonna get a
fat guy and a cannonball?

175
00:10:42,298 --> 00:10:44,839
Well... what if you showed up bad

176
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,476
naked, huh? You still
got that belt sander?

177
00:10:48,499 --> 00:10:52,571
Well, you on all fours, that
thingvibratin', kickin'

178
00:10:52,572 --> 00:10:56,151
up sawdust, ho ho! She'll
get the picture!

179
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:01,467
Hello?
- Hey, Jerry, guess
where I'm calling from!

180
00:11:01,468 --> 00:11:04,618
World War I plane?
- No, I'm in my shower.

181
00:11:04,619 --> 00:11:07,302
Well, you know, I'm trying to get
out of the shower sooner, and

182
00:11:07,303 --> 00:11:10,059
then I ask myself, 'Why?' I mean
this is where I want to be.

183
00:11:10,405 --> 00:11:13,111
So I got a waterproof phone,
I shaved, I brushed my teeth,

184
00:11:13,112 --> 00:11:15,605
and now I ordered a
pair of chinos from J. Crew.

185
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:20,269
When are ya gettin' out?
- I'm
not! I'll see ya later, buddy.

186
00:11:21,403 --> 00:11:26,383
Bad news, people. Peggy
is home sick.
- Oh, please.

187
00:11:26,384 --> 00:11:30,579
She's stuffed up, achy, and
suffering from intense malaise.

188
00:11:30,802 --> 00:11:35,133
Oh, come on, we all have
intense malaise. Right?

189
00:11:35,134 --> 00:11:40,029
I just spoke with her,
Elaine. She's in bed.

190
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:42,705
Yeah, let me tell you something:
this is all in her

191
00:11:42,706 --> 00:11:45,330
mind, OK? She is insane.
She thinks I made her sick

192
00:11:45,331 --> 00:11:47,653
because I coughed on her
doorknob, rubbed her

193
00:11:47,654 --> 00:11:50,629
stapler in my armpit, and put
her keyboard on my butt.

194
00:11:51,864 --> 00:11:54,442
Yeah, she's a  wacko.

195
00:11:56,944 --> 00:11:59,550
So you're Jason Hanke's
supervisor?
- Sponsor.

196
00:11:59,784 --> 00:12:02,857
Whatever. Listen, I'm very
concerned about this guy.

197
00:12:02,858 --> 00:12:05,492
He's doing very well. He's
already on to Step Ten.

198
00:12:05,493 --> 00:12:07,052
Yeah, well when you don't actually
do the steps, you can

199
00:12:07,053 --> 00:12:08,945
go through them pretty quick.
You can get through six a day.

200
00:12:10,478 --> 00:12:14,122
Is there some unresolved
issue between you and Jason?

201
00:12:14,123 --> 00:12:18,118
I don't know. A little
thing called Step Nine? Instead of

202
00:12:18,119 --> 00:12:22,082
an apology, he was
beboppin' and scattin' all over me.

203
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:25,841
I'm not sure what you want me to
do.
- Well, aren't you the boss of him?

204
00:12:25,881 --> 00:12:29,119
You shouldn't let him move up! When
I was in the Cub Scouts, I got

205
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,714
stuck on Weebolos for three years

206
00:12:30,715 --> 00:12:32,958
'cause I kept
losing the Pinewood Derby.

207
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,142
You're quite upset, George.
- Well, I think

208
00:12:35,143 --> 00:12:37,110
you should drop him down to Step Two.

209
00:12:37,111 --> 00:12:38,461
Admit there's a higher power?

210
00:12:38,462 --> 00:12:40,596
Yeah, let him chew
on that for a while.

211
00:12:41,217 --> 00:12:43,389
You know George, I
think I can help you. We're

212
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,587
having a meeting tomorrow.

213
00:12:44,588 --> 00:12:46,034
Why don't you just come by?

214
00:12:46,035 --> 00:12:49,284
All right. That's
more like it. Thank you very

215
00:12:49,285 --> 00:12:53,139
much.
- By the way, my
uncle was an alcoholic, so...

216
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:59,514
Lomez, you're not listenin'.
Jerry likes the

217
00:12:59,515 --> 00:13:03,350
naked, just some of the
things she does when she's naked.

218
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:06,495
Calm down, I'm on your side.

219
00:13:06,589 --> 00:13:12,995
Geez. Hey, hold on a second. I
got a clog, I'll call ya back.

220
00:13:16,227 --> 00:13:18,045
What are you doing?

221
00:13:18,069 --> 00:13:20,082
I found a rough spot
on the kitchen floor, I

222
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,952
thought I'd polish it up with
this belt sander I have here.

223
00:13:23,298 --> 00:13:26,865
No, not that. Why are you naked?

224
00:13:26,888 --> 00:13:31,337
I thought naked is good.
- This isn't good naked.

225
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:39,287
George, here, have a
seat.
- Where's Hanke?

226
00:13:40,564 --> 00:13:44,599
OK, let's get started. Welcome
to Rage-aholics Anonymous.

227
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,701
What? Rate-aholics?
- George, this can help you.

228
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:48,949
George, this can help you.
- Hey, I am

229
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,523
not here for rage. I'm
here for revenge.

230
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:54,483
Excuse me. We have a 'no
yelling' policy at these meetings.

231
00:13:54,675 --> 00:13:59,341
Excuse me. Am I talking
to you, Pinhead? Am I?!

232
00:14:00,123 --> 00:14:05,580
Please don't call me
'Pinhead'.
- I'm losin' it!

233
00:14:06,859 --> 00:14:09,227
He took you to Rage-aholics? Why?

234
00:14:09,228 --> 00:14:13,147
Probably because this
whole Universe is against me!

235
00:14:13,859 --> 00:14:16,784
You've got a little rage.
- I know. And now they

236
00:14:16,785 --> 00:14:19,675
want me to bottle it up.
It makes me so mad!

237
00:14:20,108 --> 00:14:23,364
By the way, my bad naked
demo didn't quite

238
00:14:23,365 --> 00:14:26,228
work.
- This bread has nuts in it!

239
00:14:26,467 --> 00:14:29,007
Oh, great. Elaine. What is wrong with my

240
00:14:29,008 --> 00:14:31,747
body?
- Chicken wing shoulder blades.

241
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:35,792
That's it?
- No, but
that's one problem. Why?

242
00:14:35,954 --> 00:14:38,352
Well, I was walking
around naked in front of Melissa

243
00:14:38,353 --> 00:14:40,395
the other day--
- Whoa! Walking around naked?

244
00:14:40,396 --> 00:14:43,990
hh... that is not a
good look for a man.

245
00:14:45,091 --> 00:14:47,981
Why not? It's a good look for a woman.

246
00:14:48,233 --> 00:14:52,890
Well, the female body
is a... work of art. The male

247
00:14:52,891 --> 00:14:58,363
body is utilitarian, it's
for gettin' around, like a jeep.

248
00:14:58,654 --> 00:15:02,628
So you don't think it's
attractive?
- It's hideous.

249
00:15:02,667 --> 00:15:08,076
The hair, the... the
lumpiness. It's simian.

250
00:15:08,489 --> 00:15:13,669
Well, some women like
it.
- Hmm. Sickies.

251
00:15:14,696 --> 00:15:18,726
Installing your
Clarkman garbage disposal.

252
00:15:18,727 --> 00:15:21,883
Dismantle latch hasp beneath main

253
00:15:21,884 --> 00:15:25,612
drainage lot. Oh, come on, Clarkman.

254
00:15:31,018 --> 00:15:33,453
Is, uh, David Puddy
there?" This is Puddy.

255
00:15:34,127 --> 00:15:36,913
Well, this is Kramer.
- I know.

256
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,981
Um, listen, you're a mechanic. Could

257
00:15:38,982 --> 00:15:41,026
you help me install a garbage disposal?

258
00:15:41,027 --> 00:15:42,901
Well, it's a big job.
You've got to dismantle

259
00:15:42,902 --> 00:15:45,055
the latch hasp from the
auxiliary drainage line.

260
00:15:45,196 --> 00:15:46,595
No. It says 'main line'.
- It's a

261
00:15:46,596 --> 00:15:48,281
misprint. What do you got, a Clarkman?

262
00:15:48,351 --> 00:15:50,654
Yeah."  "Hey, man, I'll call you back.

263
00:15:50,655 --> 00:15:54,379
I'll talk you through it.
- Oh,
OK. Well, thanks, buddy.

264
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,039
Hey, Puddy.

265
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,758
Hey, Babe, your boss called. You

266
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:58,789
owe five bucks for a balloon bouquet.

267
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,093
Yeah, he says you can just give it

268
00:16:00,094 --> 00:16:01,473
to him tomorrow when you see him.

269
00:16:01,474 --> 00:16:05,781
Balloon bouquet? For who?
- Peggy took a turn for the worst.

270
00:16:06,368 --> 00:16:08,700
Peggy. Oh, great. I suppose she's

271
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:11,649
still blaming me?
- That's what he said.

272
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:15,616
I don't believe this
woman.
- Talk to me, Babe.

273
00:16:16,354 --> 00:16:19,252
She's this crazy woman who is convinced

274
00:16:19,253 --> 00:16:23,007
that my germs make her sick.
- Oh, germ-o-phobe.

275
00:16:23,008 --> 00:16:25,482
I know what that's about.

276
00:16:27,365 --> 00:16:31,790
I'm a recovering
germ-o-phobe. Ten years.

277
00:16:32,506 --> 00:16:36,416
What is this symbol?
- It's a germ.

278
00:16:38,827 --> 00:16:42,709
Elaine, it was very nice of you
to bring the man you're currently

279
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,029
sleeping with over to talk to me, but I

280
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:48,261
assure you, I don't
have any problem with germs.

281
00:16:48,376 --> 00:16:52,639
Don't you? Elaine.
- Please!

282
00:16:53,151 --> 00:16:56,957
I know it looks bleak. I've been
there. Ten years ago waking up in

283
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,173
bed next to a woman like this would've

284
00:16:59,174 --> 00:17:01,272
sent me running for the Phisohex.

285
00:17:01,273 --> 00:17:01,701
Really?

286
00:17:01,702 --> 00:17:04,465
I still have trouble 
looking at those disgusting

287
00:17:04,466 --> 00:17:06,750
old bedroom slippers
she slogs around in.

288
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,896
Hey, I've had those since college.

289
00:17:08,897 --> 00:17:11,590
They're bunnies.
- They're bacteria traps.

290
00:17:11,591 --> 00:17:16,111
So you... just learned to live
with it?
- For the most part.

291
00:17:16,238 --> 00:17:19,415
OK, we're broken up
for the rest of the day.

292
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,281
So I'm glad we had a
talk and worked this out.

293
00:17:22,282 --> 00:17:23,642
Don't you feel this is better?

294
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:27,667
This is nice.
- Yes,
clothes. This is normal.

295
00:17:28,271 --> 00:17:30,889
Hey, what are you doing tomorrow?

296
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:34,123
I was thinking that we could go down...

297
00:17:34,124 --> 00:17:38,831
Jerry? Jerry, are you listening to me?

298
00:17:39,194 --> 00:17:40,746
Oh... yeah. What? I'm sorry.

299
00:17:40,747 --> 00:17:43,429
I wanted to know what
you're doing tomorrow.

300
00:17:43,965 --> 00:17:49,258
Oh, maybe a haircut, and,
I don't know, maybe a...

301
00:17:54,242 --> 00:17:57,907
So you broke up?
- We couldn't
carry on a conversation.

302
00:17:57,908 --> 00:18:00,075
I kept trying to picture her naked, she

303
00:18:00,076 --> 00:18:02,242
kept trying to not picture me naked.

304
00:18:02,951 --> 00:18:05,335
Hang on.

305
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,613
So what are you up to?

306
00:18:08,614 --> 00:18:11,812
Oh, just cooking up a little
thank you for Puddy.

307
00:18:11,813 --> 00:18:14,547
Hey, how do you
make those radish roses?

308
00:18:14,548 --> 00:18:16,699
Insert a knife into the
center and twist. Then,

309
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,752
to make it bloom, soak it in
water for thirty to forty minutes.

310
00:18:19,776 --> 00:18:22,241
No problem there.

311
00:18:24,693 --> 00:18:26,810
George. Thanks for
coming down to talk to me.

312
00:18:26,811 --> 00:18:28,857
I wanted to see you right
away, but my hours

313
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:31,513
here aren't very
flexible. I just started yesterday.

314
00:18:31,601 --> 00:18:33,644
Well, I'm here. What is it?

315
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:35,837
Well, I talked to my sponsor, and,

316
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:38,869
uh, I've thought it over,
and, you know, my apology

317
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,774
at the coffee shop was sarcastic,

318
00:18:40,775 --> 00:18:43,339
and rude, and you deserve much better.

319
00:18:43,829 --> 00:18:47,603
Well, thank you.
- You're welcome.

320
00:18:47,604 --> 00:18:50,830
Can I get a Triple Minute Man
Mint?
- Waffle or sugar cone?

321
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:55,058
Uh, excuse me, uh, um, Jason. I don't

322
00:18:55,059 --> 00:18:58,275
want to get into a
big thing here, but...

323
00:18:58,276 --> 00:19:01,400
I'm not sure if, technically, what you

324
00:19:01,401 --> 00:19:05,100
just said was actually
an apology.
- What?

325
00:19:05,201 --> 00:19:06,612
Can you get on that cone?

326
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:09,174
Would you hang on just
a second, son? about?

327
00:19:09,175 --> 00:19:10,532
George, what are you talking.

328
00:19:10,533 --> 00:19:13,386
Well, it's just, all you said
was 'your welcome', which is

329
00:19:13,387 --> 00:19:16,477
nice. It's very nice. But...
I feel I gotta get the apology.

330
00:19:16,478 --> 00:19:18,696
Is there anybody else here but you?

331
00:19:18,995 --> 00:19:21,966
I'm alone, and it's my second
day. You know, I don't even think we

332
00:19:21,967 --> 00:19:24,653
have that flavor so... George,
really, enough, ok? You know,

333
00:19:24,654 --> 00:19:25,886
I-I admitted I was wrong, so

334
00:19:25,887 --> 00:19:27,447
what more do you want from me?

335
00:19:27,448 --> 00:19:30,361
I would like an apology.
- All right, look, you know--

336
00:19:30,362 --> 00:19:31,103
Did you try it?

337
00:19:31,104 --> 00:19:32,715
No, this guy doesn't know what he's

338
00:19:32,716 --> 00:19:34,660
doing.
- Oh, yes I do. Yes, I do. OK?

339
00:19:35,111 --> 00:19:36,423
I'm interacting with someone here, if

340
00:19:36,424 --> 00:19:37,947
you can understand
that. Now, I'm sorry.

341
00:19:37,948 --> 00:19:39,576
Baah! There it is!
You just said it! That's

342
00:19:39,577 --> 00:19:41,620
what I want! Now say it
again, and tell it to me.

343
00:19:41,954 --> 00:19:46,060
I'm not saying anything to you.
I'm not sorry. I was never sorry. It

344
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:48,137
was cashmere. I hate Step Nine!

345
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:51,420
Where's that Rum Raisin?
Where is it? Can't

346
00:19:51,421 --> 00:19:56,394
find anything. I need a drink. Ah,
daquiri ice. Here we go. What are

347
00:19:56,395 --> 00:20:01,855
you looking at? Get out! Come on,
can't you see we're closed?! Get out!

348
00:20:04,255 --> 00:20:06,371
Mmm. This food is fantastic,

349
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:09,344
And what a pretty radish rose, huh?

350
00:20:09,556 --> 00:20:12,600
Well, thank you.
- Here's to Peggy, on

351
00:20:12,601 --> 00:20:15,956
her first week of
being germ-free, free.

352
00:20:16,023 --> 00:20:20,159
Yeah. And here's to David
Puddy for helping me install

353
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:25,381
a much needed and much appreciated
garbage disposal in my bathtub.

354
00:20:26,277 --> 00:20:28,771
You have a garbage
disposal in your bathtub?

355
00:20:28,772 --> 00:20:30,831
Oh, yeah, and I use it all the time.

356
00:20:30,917 --> 00:20:34,092
I made this whole meal in  there.

357
00:20:34,093 --> 00:20:41,546
This food was in the shower with you?
- Mm-hmm. I prepared it as I bathed.

358
00:20:41,547 --> 00:20:43,639
Oh, germs. Germs. Germs!

359
00:20:51,397 --> 00:20:55,950
Excuse me. Is this, uh,
Rage-aholics?
- No, germ-o-phobes.

360
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:59,798
Thanks. What are you
guys doin' here?
- Kramer.

361
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:01,151
Right.

362
00:21:01,592 --> 00:21:08,054
Hi, I'm, uh, Jason. I'm a
rage-aholic.
- Hi, Jason.

363
00:21:08,461 --> 00:21:13,174
Uh, this is my first meeting.
- Step-skipper. That man is a step-skipper!

364
00:21:13,175 --> 00:21:16,868
He skips Step Nine!
- Please. Step Nine.

365
00:21:16,869 --> 00:21:19,713
That's right! He never
apologized to me for saying

366
00:21:19,714 --> 00:21:22,954
that I would stretch out the
neck hole of his sweater.

367
00:21:22,955 --> 00:21:24,135
It wasn't funny.

368
00:21:24,136 --> 00:21:28,921
It was a very nice sweater. Take a
look at his neck, not to mention

369
00:21:28,922 --> 00:21:34,039
the melon sitting on top of it. 
I don't know if I'd trust him with a V-neck.

370
00:21:34,579 --> 00:21:37,959
He's beboppin' and
scattin', and I'm losin' it!
