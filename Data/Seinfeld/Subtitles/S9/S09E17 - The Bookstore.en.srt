1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,700
I'm doing a set tonight, 
you hangin' out?

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,700
Yeah, yeah.
- Alright.

3
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,100
I don't believe this.

4
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,700
I read somewhere that this Brentano's 
is the place to meet girls in New York.

5
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,200
First it was the health club, 
then the supermarket, now the bookstore. 

6
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,200
They could put it anywhere they want, 
no one's meetin' anybody.

7
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,000
Jerry, look at all these pagodas, huh? 

8
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,500
I gotta get over to Hong Kong 
before it all goes back to China...

9
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,900
You better hurry.

10
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,500
I'm gonna hit the head.

11
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,600
Oh, boy, look at this. 
Hong Kong's outlawed the rickshaw. 

12
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,800
See, I always thought 
those would be perfect for New York.

13
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,800
Yes, the city needs more 
slow-moving wicker vehicles.

14
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,700
Hmm, Elaine's been to Hong Kong. 
I should give her a call.

15
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,000
She's at that annual Peterman party tonight. 
You know, the one she danced at last year?

16
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,800
No, that wasn't dancing.

17
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,000
Hey, there's Leo.

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,100
Oh? Who's Leo?

19
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,200
Uncle Leo.

20
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,300
Oh, yeah. Right. Uncle, Leo. 

21
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:35,300
Forgot his first name...

22
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,700
Did I just see that?!

23
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,700
Well, that oughta keep you busy 
for a couple of days, huh?

24
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,300
So, Elaine-- 
are you going to dance this year?

25
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,300
Maybe...

26
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,300
All over your face!

27
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,500
If you do dance, 
the cooks want to know--

28
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,500
so they can be brought out of the kitchen. 

29
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,500
They missed it last year.

30
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,800
My friends, a toast. 

31
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,800
As the wooly-haired Melanesians 
of Papua-New Guinea once said:

32
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,500
All right! 
Who's dancing? 

33
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,400
No one?

34
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,400
Alright, I'll just have to 
get things started. 

35
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,500
Hi, I'm Zach.

36
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,500
Hi, I'm miserable. 

37
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,200
Excuse me, Sir. 
What are you doing?

38
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,500
I'm all set.

39
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,500
Did you take that book 
with you into the bathroom?

40
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:02,200
What do you want to hear?

41
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,700
They made me buy it!

42
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,100
A hundred bucks this thing cost me. 

43
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,100
How dare they?

44
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:07,900


45
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,300
If it wasn't for the toilet, 
there would be no books.

46
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:15,100
Yeah. I understand Gutenberg used to 
spend a fair amount of time in there.

47
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:19,100
They're selling coffee, bran muffins-- 
you're surrounded by reading material. 

48
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,300
It's entrapment!

49
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,300
"French Impressionist Paintings"?

50
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,800
I find the soothing pastorial images 
very conduc-

51
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,100
Thank you very much.

52
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,200
I'm gonna go back there later and return it 
when there's different people working. 

53
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,600
You want to catch a movie?

54
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,700
I can't. 
I'm meeting Uncle Leo. 

55
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,700
I saw him shoplifting at the bookstore.

56
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:42,700
Alright, Leo! 
Stickin' it to the man!

57
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,500
Sleeping in the car again?

58
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,300
Cocktail flu.

59
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,000
Oh, right. 
The big party.

60
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You, uh-- 
didn't dance again, did you?

61
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,500
No, I found a better way 
to humiliate myself. 

62
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,500
There was this guy, 
and we had a few too many...

63
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,600
You went home with him?

64
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,400
Worse. 

65
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,400
We made out at the table 
like our plane was going down!

66
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,000
Ah, the drunken make-out. 
An office classic. 

67
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,800
Did you end up xeroxing anything?

68
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,300
Do you know how embarrassing this is 
to someone in my position?

69
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,800
What's your position?

70
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,100
I am an associate.

71
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,500
Hey, me too.

72
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,400
Yeah, me too.

73
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,400
Oh God. Why did I do this? 
Now I'm the office skank.

74
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,900
Well, unless you tell everybody 
you're dating.

75
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,300
Ohh... right. 

76
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,300
Cause if we're dating, 

77
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,300
what everyone saw was just 
a beautiful moment between two lovers.

78
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,900
As opposed to a spirited bout 
of Skanko-Roman wrestling.

79
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,100
Oh, bravo.

80
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,500
Oh, hey. Can I fix you fellas 
some drinks and sandwiches?

81
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,300
No, we've already eaten.

82
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,200
But you can clear 
some of this stuff out of the way.

83
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,300
Jerry, check this out.  

84
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,600
Remember my idea about 
rickshaws in New York? 

85
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,600
Well, we're gonna make it happen!

86
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,400
No, you're not.

87
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,200
Newman, he knows a guy 
in the Hong Kong post office...

88
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,800
No, he doesn't.

89
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,600
He's shipping us a rickshaw. 
It can't miss!

90
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,900
Yes, it can.

91
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,800
We'll start out with one, 

92
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,500
and they when it catches on, 
we're gonna have a whole fleet!

93
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,500
It's the romance of the Hansom cab 
without the guilt or dander of the equine.

94
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,900
So, who's gonna pull this thing?

95
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,200
Well, I just assumed 
that you would.

96
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,900
Yeah, but I thought--

97
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,900
My, isn't this an awkward moment?

98
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,200
What about the homeless?

99
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,000
Can't we worry about them later?

100
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,800
To pull the rickshaw.

101
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,100
They do have 
an intimate knowledge of the street.

102
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,700
They're always walkin' around the city. 

103
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,500
Why not just strap something to them?

104
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,500
Now, that's the first sensible idea 
I've heard all day.

105
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,400
Jerry, hello! 

106
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,500
So, Leo, how's everything? 
You doin' okay?

107
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,500
I still have the ringing in the ears. 
Sounds like the phone.

108
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,600
Yeah, yeah. But what about money? 

109
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,100
Are you strapped? 
Do you need a little?

110
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,900
Are you kidding? 
I should be loaning <i>you</i> money! 

111
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,400
But I'm not.

112
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,000
Leo, I saw you 
in Brentano's yesterday.

113
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,300
Why didn't you say hello?

114
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,100
Because you were too busy 
stealing a book.

115
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,800
You still say hello.

116
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,400
Leo, I saw you steal.

117
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,200
Oh, they don't care. 
We all do it.

118
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,800
Who, criminals?

119
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,300
Senior citizens. 
No big deal.

120
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,400
You could get arrested.

121
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,600
Arrested? Come on! 

122
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,200
I'm an old man. I'm confused! 
I thought I paid for it. 

123
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,000
What's my name? 
Can you take me home?

124
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,100
Leo...

125
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:02,900
Alright, alright, Mr. Goody Two-Shoes. 
You made your point.

126
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,100
Thank you.

127
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:08,100
Will somebody answer that damn phone?

128
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,700
Of course Zach and I 
have been dating. 

129
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,100
What did you think, 
I was the office skank?

130
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,300
Well...

131
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,500
"Well"? We've been 
dating for three months. 

132
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,500
Between you and me, and... 
anyone else you want to tell.

133
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,800
Oh man.

134
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,000
Isn't that Zach?

135
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,100
Yeah.

136
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,000
Aren't you upset?

137
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Yes. 
Oh, man! Oh!

138
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,500
Alright, listen up. 

139
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,500
Now, you three have been hand-picked 
out of possibly dozens that applied. 

140
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,600
Now, what we're looking for are 

141
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,600
motivated, hard-working, homeless gentlemen 
like yourselves to pull rickshaws. 

142
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,200
Now, I don't care where you're from, 
or how you got here, 

143
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,200
or what happened to your homes. 
But you will have to be physically fit.

144
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
The government!

145
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,100
Because to pull rickshaws 
means more than just strong legs. 

146
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,100
You're also going to need 
a well-toned upper body.

147
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,800
Or a shirt...

148
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,800
Alright, who's first?

149
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,100
Hey
- Name, please.

150
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,200
Rusty.

151
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,300
Rusty.

152
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,600
You know, I once knew a horse 
named Rusty. No offence.

153
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,500
Alright, now take it down to 
the end of the block. 

154
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,300
Make a controlled turn, 
and bring her back. 

155
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,900
Let's see what you've got! 

156
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,200
Ok? Ready, and go!

157
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,800
Giddy up! 

158
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,900
Good form.

159
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:32,500
Alright, pace yourself, 

160
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,500
'cause you're gonna have to do this 
all day for very little money.

161
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,500
Hey, what's he doin'?

162
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,300
I think he stealing our rickshaw!

163
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,000
Well, then, he's out!

164
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'll take the job. 
Potato salad!

165
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,300
Yes, I, uh, I need to 
return this book.

166
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,300
I'm sorry, we can't 
take this book back.

167
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,000
Why not?

168
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,700
It's been flagged.

169
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,700
Flagged?

170
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,600
It's been in the bathroom.

171
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,000
It says that on the computer?

172
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Please take it home. 
We don't want it near the other books.

173
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,300
Well, you just lost 
a lot of business! 

174
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:15,300
Because I love to read!

175
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,700
I don't believe this! 

176
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,300
Excuse me--
I wonder if you could do me a favor? 

177
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,400
My uncle's having 
a little problem with shoplifting...

178
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,900
Mm-hmm. Where's your uncle?

179
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,700
He's over there in the overcoat. 

180
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,400
If you could just 
kind of put a scare into him... 

181
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,600
You know, set him straight...

182
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,600
We have a 51-50 in paperbacks. 
All units respond.

183
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,500
"51-50"? 

184
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,600
That - that's just a scare, right?

185
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,600
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to 
stand out of the way and let us handle this. 

186
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,400
Swarm! Swarm!

187
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,400
What?

188
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,300
I'm an old man! I'm confused!

189
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,800
You're under arrest.

190
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,400
I just wanted you to scare him.

191
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,900
Jerry, you ratted me out?

192
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,200
Hello?

193
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,200
Hello.

194
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,600
Mom, I didn't rat out Uncle Leo. 
I just wanted the guard to scare him straight.

195
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,000
Jerry, he won't last a day in prison.

196
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Prison? 
I'm sure it's just a fine.

197
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,500
He's got priors.

198
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,800
Prior convictions? Leo?

199
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,500
It was a crime of passion. 
Leave it alone.

200
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,400
Besides, it's not stealing 
if it's something you need.

201
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,600
What does that mean?

202
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,500
Nobody pays for everyting.

203
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,300
You're stealing too?

204
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,600
<i>What are you stealing?</i>

205
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,100
Nothing. 

206
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,400
Well, they wear out so quick.

207
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,700
Mom, you too?

208
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,700
Sometimes your father forgets, 
so I have to steal them.

209
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,400
Alright, I'll talk to you later.

210
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,500
Well, the rickshaw's gone. 

211
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,600
We strapped it to a homeless guy 
and he-- 

212
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,900
he bolted.

213
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,900
85% of all homeless rickshaw businesses 
fail within the first three months.

214
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,900
See, we should've gotten 
some collateral from him.

215
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,500
Like his bag of cans, or... 

216
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:06,500
his other bag of cans.

217
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,700
We gotta find that rickshaw. 

218
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,200
You check the sewers and dumpsters. 

219
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,200
I'll hit the soup kitchens, 
bakeries, and smorgasbords.

220
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,500
To the Idiotmobile!

221
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,400
So, even though you're not really going out 
with this guy, he's cheating on you?

222
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,600
That is correct. 

223
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,200
But here's the beauty part:

224
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,200
Now I stand up for myself by telling everybody 
I'm dumping his sorry ass, 

225
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,000
and I'm the office--

226
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,800
Tina Turner?

227
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,800
Alright.

228
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,200
Well, I've been to every Brentano's. 

229
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,500
This thing's flagged 
in every database in town!

230
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,500
Is it so horrible 
to have to keep a book?

231
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,400
I don't understand what the big deal is. 
They let you try on pants.

232
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,200
Not underpants.

233
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,900
Hey, that's your Uncle Leo.

234
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,000
Uncle Leo. Hello!

235
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,800
Jerry.

236
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,100
Uncle Leo, I'm sorry. 

237
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,400
I didn't know about your... past.

238
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,400
You mean my crime of passion? 

239
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,500
If anyone betrays me, I never forget!

240
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,500
Uncle Leo, wait! Hello?

241
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,700
French impressionism. 
Oh, I love this. 

242
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,500
Now, what is the problem with this book?

243
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,200
Nothing.

244
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,300
How much do you want for it?

245
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:28,000
You know, I could let it go for... 
say, $125.

246
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,100
Leo's furious. 

247
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:33,000
What is that doing on the table?

248
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,700
Jerry, simmer down.

249
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:38,300
I'm not eating anything 
in the vicinity of that book.

250
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,100
What is wrong with this book?

251
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:40,700
Simmer!

252
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,600
That book has been on a wild ride. 

253
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,400
George took it into the bathroom 
with him and--

254
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,200
Alright! 

255
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,200
Everyone clear! 
Biohazard coming through! 

256
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,600
Clear! Clear!

257
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,600
May I ask, what do you 
read in the bathroom?

258
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,800
I don't read in the bathroom.

259
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,800
Well, aren't you something?

260
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:11,300
Elaine, do you have a moment? 
It's about your lover.

261
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:15,300
Oh yes. I know all about 
his little performance in the break room.

262
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,300
Elaine--

263
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:21,300
Who among us hasn't snuck into the break room 
to nibble on a love newton?

264
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,500
Love newton?

265
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm afraid 
the problem with Zach is more serious. 

266
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
He's back on the horse, Elaine. 

267
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Smack. White palace. 
The Chinaman's nightcap.

268
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,500
An addict?  

269
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,300
Well, it just keeps getting better!

270
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,100
And, in a tiny way, 
I almost feel responsible. 

271
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:46,100
I'm the one who sent him to Thailand, 
in search of low-cost whistles. 

272
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,200
Filled his head with pseudoerotic tales 
of my own Opium excursions. 

273
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Plus I have him some phone numbers of 
places he could score near the hotel.

274
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,800
Look, uh, Mr. Peterman, 
the fact is that 

275
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,600
I was planning on 
breaking up with Zach anyway. 

276
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,300
He was cheating on me!

277
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,800
Damn it, Elaine. 
That wasn't Zach. 

278
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,700
That was the yam-yam. 

279
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,800
Now, he is going cold turkey. 
And you will be at his side.

280
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,900
Oh. Well, you know, 
I had planned to, uh-

281
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,100
No buts, Elaine. 

282
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:18,300
Or I will strip you 
of your "associate" status. 

283
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:22,300
Uh, P.S.: 
the first 24 hours are the worst.

284
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,500
Better bring a poncho.

285
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,600
It was a crime of passion.

286
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,500
If anyone betrays me, I never forget.

287
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,500
He won't last a day in prison.

288
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,800
Jerry.

289
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,000
Hello. 

290
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Jerry. 

291
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,200
Hello. 

292
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,900
Jerry.  

293
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:58,900
Answer that damn phone!

294
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,000
Hello?

295
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,200
Hey, it's me.

296
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,200
Uncle Leo?

297
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,900
Oh, that's nice. 
What are you up to?

298
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,100
Nightmares. You?

299
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,900
My fake boyfriend 
is going through real withdrawals.

300
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,700
I'm burning up!

301
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,800
Eat your soup!

302
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,400
You're not feeding him, are you?

303
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,500
Why? 

304
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,900
I told you, away from the curtains. 

305
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,400
Away.  

306
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,200
Use your bucket.  

307
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,700
There you go, that's it.  

308
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:31,700
You know what? I gotta go.

309
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,900
Hey, buddy.

310
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,200
Kramer!

311
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:39,500
I thought I heard you.

312
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,700
Get out of here!

313
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,300
Kramer? 
There you are.

314
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,600
Will everybody please leave?!

315
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,300
I just heard that a postman 
spotted a rickshaw down in Battery Park.

316
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,000
Our rickshaw?

317
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It's entirely possible.

318
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,800
I want everyone out!

319
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,800
Let's talk in Jerry's kitchen. 
I'll make some cocoa.

320
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,800
Good night, Jerry.

321
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,800
Good night, Newman.

322
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,300
There it is!

323
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,100
Rusty!

324
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,500
Oh, there you are. 

325
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,900
Oh, do I get the job?

326
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,500
Yeah, yeah. We'll get back to you. 

327
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,500
Let's get this baby home.

328
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,200
What?

329
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,800
You know, when you think about it, 

330
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,800
it's kind of silly for us both to 
pull this thing all the way back uptown. 

331
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,200
I mean, after all, 
it is a conveyance.

332
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,900
Yes, that's true.

333
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,800
So, which one of us is gonna pull?

334
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,700
Well, there's only one way 
to settle this. 

335
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:40,400
One spot, two spot, zig, zag, tear, 
pop-die, pennygot, tennyum, tear, 

336
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,700
harum, scare 'em, 
rip 'em, tear 'em, 

337
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,300
tay, taw, toe...

338
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,000
Yeah.

339
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,600
Best two out of three? 
One spot, two spot...

340
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,600
Hey, boy. Smooth it out up there. 
Too much jostling!

341
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,600
So, you want to donate this to charity?

342
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,200
Well, I assume 
there's some sort of write-off.

343
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,500
What's the value of the book?

344
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,100
Uh, about two hundred dollars, 
Miss DeMooney.

345
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:08,100
It's DeMornay. 
Rebecca DeMornay.

346
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,200
Oh, wait a second. 

347
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,200
This book has been in the bathroom.

348
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,400
What are you talking about? 

349
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,600
That - that's ridiculous.

350
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,700
It's been flagged. 

351
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,700
I know. 
I used to work in a Brentano's. 

352
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,800
Mister, we're trying to 
help the homeless here. 

353
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:27,800
It's bad enough that we have some nut out there 
trying to strap them to a rickshaw!

354
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,600
Alright, I, I'll just take fifty. 

355
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,700
Do we have a deal?

356
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,900
Yeah, and here it is: 

357
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,500
You get your toilet book out of here, 

358
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,500
and I won't jump over this counter 
and punch you in the brain!

359
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,700
I could take it in merchandise...

360
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,700
Here I come...

361
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,500
So, this book'll tell me 
how to get puke out of cashmere?

362
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,900
Yeah.

363
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,100
Great.

364
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,300
So, the worst is over?

365
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:59,300
Yeah. 
Now I can break up with him. 

366
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,700
He's clean, 
and I'm the office hero.

367
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,100
Seems like you're better 
at fake relationships than real ones.

368
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,100
Yeah, huh. I even got an idea out of it. 

369
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,100
The Detox Poncho.

370
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,800
See ya.

371
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,500
I'd like to speak with the manager, please.

372
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,000
Mind your pace, Boy. 
Chop, chop!

373
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Oh, I can't go on. 
I gotta take a break. 

374
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Well, don't tarry. 
I'm behind schedule as it is.

375
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,000
Boy... 

376
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,400
Boy! 

377
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,400
Kramer!

378
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,400
Whoa! Wait!

379
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:39,100
Well, this is the first day 
of the rest of my life!

380
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,300
George? 
What are you doing here?

381
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,100
I can't sell the book. 
It's been marked.

382
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,400
It certainly has.

383
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,900
So, I'm gonna steal another one, 
and then I'm gonna return it. 

384
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,300
That way, everything is even.

385
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:16,300
You defile one book, steal another, 
ask for your money back-- 

386
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,800
and to you that's even?

387
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,300
I'm goin' in!

388
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,200
Did you want to speak to the manager?

389
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,100
Yes. My Uncle Leo was caught 
shoplifting here the other day...

390
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,200
Yes, Uncle Leo. 
I remember him. 

391
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,000
I'm sorry, our policy is, 
we prosecute all shoplifters.

392
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,900
Oh, come on. 
He's just a lonely old man. 

393
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,500
All old people steal.

394
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,300
That's right. 
That's why we stopped carrying batteries. 

395
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,000
Look, I'll be honest with you.
We've had a lot of trouble with theft lately.

396
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,600
And my boss said
I have to make an example to someone.

397
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,200
So it could be anyone?

398
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,200
I... guess. As long as 
we catch him in the act.

399
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:53,700
That guy! 

400
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,500
Swarm! Swarm!

401
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:00,500
No! Jerry!
