1
00:00:02,209 --> 00:00:03,847
The old-fashioned barbershop...</i>

2
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:08,521
...is, unfortunately, becoming a thing
of the past. What went wrong?</i>

3
00:00:08,689 --> 00:00:13,638
First of all, he needs a $20,000 chair
to make a three dollar tip.</i>

4
00:00:13,809 --> 00:00:17,404
I say, cut back on the chair,
update the magazines.</i>

5
00:00:18,049 --> 00:00:20,609
Why do barbers always display
that license?</i>

6
00:00:20,769 --> 00:00:22,361
There's no laws in haircutting...</i>

7
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:25,123
...except show every customer
the back of their head.</i>

8
00:00:25,489 --> 00:00:26,638
I don't wanna see the back.</i>

9
00:00:26,809 --> 00:00:29,403
Why see something that I'm never
gonna see at any other time?</i>

10
00:00:29,569 --> 00:00:30,888
When I buy pants...</i>

11
00:00:31,049 --> 00:00:34,962
...two salesmen don't lift me up and
go, "How do you like the crotch?"</i>

12
00:00:35,129 --> 00:00:37,518
If I wanted to see everything,
I would've been a fly.</i>

13
00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:44,767
Well, George, we here at Sanalac...</i>

14
00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:47,318
...like to think of ourselves
as fairly progressive.</i>

15
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:49,798
We have a small but prestigious
group of clients.</i>

16
00:00:49,969 --> 00:00:54,087
A lot of people consider me
small and prestigious.</i>

17
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:56,681
That's funny, George.</i>

18
00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:58,487
- You're very quick.
- Oh, well.</i>

19
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:00,128
I feel like I don't...</i>

20
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:02,883
I don't have to explain
every little thing to you.</i>

21
00:01:03,049 --> 00:01:04,687
You understand everything
immediately.</i>

22
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:06,919
I enjoy understanding.</i>

23
00:01:08,289 --> 00:01:10,041
I want you to have this job.</i>

24
00:01:10,209 --> 00:01:11,961
- Of course-
- Stu Zimmer's on line two.</i>

25
00:01:12,129 --> 00:01:14,085
Great. Thanks.</i>

26
00:01:14,249 --> 00:01:16,524
I've gotta take this call. Listen...</i>

27
00:01:16,689 --> 00:01:18,680
...I'm really glad that you came in.</i>

28
00:01:20,769 --> 00:01:22,839
"I want you to have this job.</i>

29
00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:25,565
Of course..."</i>

30
00:01:25,889 --> 00:01:28,119
- Yeah?
- That's it.</i>

31
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:30,038
- What do you mean?
- What?</i>

32
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:32,803
He never finished. He got a call.
That was the end.</i>

33
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:35,483
- "Of course"was the last thing?
- Maybe he was gonna say:</i>

34
00:01:35,649 --> 00:01:38,243
"Of course, I have to check
with my associates."</i>

35
00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:41,446
"I want you to have this job.
Of course, the board of directors...</i>

36
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:43,759
...is under indictment
and will be serving time."</i>

37
00:01:43,929 --> 00:01:46,841
"I want you to have this job.
Of course, sodomy is a prerequisite."</i>

38
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:49,000
All right. All right.

39
00:01:49,169 --> 00:01:50,727
Why don't you just call him.

40
00:01:50,889 --> 00:01:54,040
He made a big deal about how
I understand everything immediately.</i>

41
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:55,403
That's what impressed him.</i>

42
00:01:55,569 --> 00:01:58,402
So if you call to ask if you have
the job, you might lose it.</i>

43
00:01:58,569 --> 00:02:02,528
- If I don't call...
- You have it, but you'll never know it.</i>

44
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,759
- What kind of company?
- Rest stop supply.</i>

45
00:02:04,929 --> 00:02:07,523
Oh, good for you.

46
00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:09,088
- Yeah, yeah.
- Hey.</i>

47
00:02:09,249 --> 00:02:10,682
- Hey.
- Hey.</i>

48
00:02:10,849 --> 00:02:13,727
- Shower?
- Haircut. I'm very happy with this.</i>

49
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:15,561
- Who'd you use? Gino?
- Of course.</i>

50
00:02:15,729 --> 00:02:18,118
- Wouldn't let that butcher cut my hair.
- What butcher?</i>

51
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:20,757
The uncle. Enzo.
That's the guy Jerry uses.</i>

52
00:02:20,929 --> 00:02:24,126
I've been going to him for 12 years.
I can't switch. I'd hurt his feelings.</i>

53
00:02:24,289 --> 00:02:27,008
- You never get good haircuts.
- You can get a good one today.</i>

54
00:02:27,169 --> 00:02:30,206
It's Enzo's day off.
Gino's there all by himself.</i>

55
00:02:30,369 --> 00:02:31,563
- Really?
- Yeah.</i>

56
00:02:31,729 --> 00:02:34,562
You should go get one, to look good
for my bachelor auction.</i>

57
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:36,048
What bachelor auction?</i>

58
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:39,645
This thing where they auction
off dates with bachelors for charity.</i>

59
00:02:39,809 --> 00:02:41,083
And you didn't ask me?</i>

60
00:02:41,249 --> 00:02:43,809
I could raise enough money
to cure polio.</i>

61
00:02:44,089 --> 00:02:46,364
They've had a cure for polio
for quite some time.</i>

62
00:02:46,689 --> 00:02:48,122
Polio?

63
00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:52,761
Will you go ahead?
You need a haircut.</i>

64
00:02:52,929 --> 00:02:54,203
- Okay.
- Yeah.</i>

65
00:02:55,169 --> 00:02:57,239
- What are you all dressed up for?
- Job interview.</i>

66
00:02:57,409 --> 00:02:59,559
- Yeah? How'd it go?
- Good.</i>

67
00:02:59,729 --> 00:03:01,685
Of course...</i>

68
00:03:07,809 --> 00:03:10,243
- Oh, Jerry!
- Hi, Enzo.</i>

69
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:12,764
- You come for the haircut?
- No.</i>

70
00:03:12,929 --> 00:03:14,521
- Actually, I was-
- It's my day off.

71
00:03:14,689 --> 00:03:17,806
But I take care of you
because you my favourite customer.</i>

72
00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:20,199
You been with me for so long.</i>

73
00:03:20,369 --> 00:03:21,722
You so loyal.

74
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:23,557
Well...</i>

75
00:03:23,729 --> 00:03:25,959
- If it's your day off-
- What's the difference?</i>

76
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:28,768
- It takes 10 minutes.
- Well, it's...</i>

77
00:03:31,009 --> 00:03:34,445
Jerry, today I'm gonna do
something special for you.</i>

78
00:03:34,609 --> 00:03:37,885
- I don't wanna take too much off.
- Hey, who's your barber, huh?</i>

79
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:41,405
You tell the joke. I cut the hair.</i>

80
00:03:42,529 --> 00:03:44,440
Gino, you've outdone yourself
this time.</i>

81
00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:47,521
This is the best haircut
I've ever had.</i>

82
00:04:00,089 --> 00:04:02,842
- He massacred you!
- I know.</i>

83
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:04,806
You look like you're 5 years old.</i>

84
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:09,317
What if I shampoo?
Sometimes a shampoo helps.</i>

85
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:11,127
You gotta start seeing
somebody else.</i>

86
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:13,405
Get out of this relationship.</i>

87
00:04:13,969 --> 00:04:16,722
I can't. He loves me.
He says I'm his most loyal customer.</i>

88
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:20,279
Plus, he's on the corner. I'd have
to pass him every day when I go by.</i>

89
00:04:20,449 --> 00:04:23,964
- Well, you gotta do it.
- I can't, I can't. I'd break his heart.</i>

90
00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:29,000
No way my Gino did that.

91
00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:33,086
- It's an Enzo.
- You told me he wouldn't be there.</i>

92
00:04:33,249 --> 00:04:35,285
- So what?
- So I didn't wanna hurt his feelings.</i>

93
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:38,839
You can't continue seeing him.
You're destroying yourself.</i>

94
00:04:41,369 --> 00:04:44,042
I'm not gonna let you.
Now, if you don't call him, I will.</i>

95
00:04:44,209 --> 00:04:46,200
No, no, Kramer, you can't do that.</i>

96
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:49,486
I'll call Gino. You'll see him.
We're gonna get that haircut fixed.</i>

97
00:04:49,649 --> 00:04:52,482
- I don't want you to call him.
- All right.

98
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:54,847
You're crazy.</i>

99
00:04:55,849 --> 00:04:58,317
So I still haven't heard
about that job.</i>

100
00:04:58,489 --> 00:05:00,923
That's a tough one.
What are you gonna do about that?</i>

101
00:05:01,249 --> 00:05:02,398
Well, I have an idea.</i>

102
00:05:03,049 --> 00:05:05,882
- Yeah?
- I show up.</i>

103
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:11,278
- What do you mean, you show up?
- I show up.</i>

104
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:13,440
I pretend I have the job.</i>

105
00:05:13,609 --> 00:05:16,646
The guy's on vacation.
If I have the job, it's fine.</i>

106
00:05:16,809 --> 00:05:20,597
If I don't, by the time he comes back,
I'm ensconced.</i>

107
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:24,759
- Not bad.
- What's the worst that could happen?</i>

108
00:05:24,929 --> 00:05:28,126
You'd be embarrassed and humiliated
in front of a large group of people...</i>

109
00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:31,167
...and have to walk out in shame
with your tail between your legs.</i>

110
00:05:32,089 --> 00:05:33,886
Yeah. So?</i>

111
00:05:34,689 --> 00:05:38,204
Yeah. I see what you mean.
I forgot who I was dealing with.</i>

112
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:41,762
Good morning. Morning.

113
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:43,847
Good morning.

114
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:45,886
Morning. Hi. Nice to see you.
How are you?</i>

115
00:05:46,049 --> 00:05:48,404
Good morning. Good morning.

116
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:50,038
Good morning.

117
00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:53,243
- How can I help you?
- The name's George Costanza.</i>

118
00:05:53,409 --> 00:05:56,560
I'm starting work here today.
I was wondering if you could...</i>

119
00:05:56,729 --> 00:05:59,289
- ... tell me where my office is?
- I wasn't aware that-</i>

120
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:01,599
Mike. This is George Costanza.</i>

121
00:06:01,769 --> 00:06:03,600
He's starting here today.</i>

122
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:05,248
Welcome aboard.</i>

123
00:06:05,409 --> 00:06:07,001
Thanks, Mike. Nice to be aboard.</i>

124
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:09,524
I didn't know Mr. Tuttle
was finished interviewing.</i>

125
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:12,726
Oh, he was probably just
getting anxious to start his vacation.</i>

126
00:06:14,369 --> 00:06:17,122
- He wants to know where his office is.
- Oh, well...</i>

127
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:18,688
Let's see. We've got two.</i>

128
00:06:18,849 --> 00:06:21,488
There's the big one down the hall
and the small one here.</i>

129
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:23,958
- I should ask Jack.
- Oh, leave Jack alone.</i>

130
00:06:24,129 --> 00:06:26,404
Jack's got enough problems.</i>

131
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:28,525
- I'll just take the small office.
- Really?</i>

132
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:30,247
Yes. I like to feel cosy.</i>

133
00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:33,242
I have a small apartment.
I like to feel tucked in, nestled in.</i>

134
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:35,081
Love to be nestled.</i>

135
00:06:35,249 --> 00:06:37,524
All right. It's 808, right down there.</i>

136
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:41,045
Meanwhile, I'll get you the Pensky file.
You can start working on that.</i>

137
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:43,040
Yes, of course. The Pensky file.</i>

138
00:06:43,209 --> 00:06:45,677
Can't wait to sink my teeth into that.</i>

139
00:06:45,849 --> 00:06:47,487
Wow, that Pensky.</i>

140
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:50,117
Well, we'll straighten him out.</i>

141
00:07:32,929 --> 00:07:34,282
What do you do there all day?</i>

142
00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:37,125
They gave me the Pensky file.</i>

143
00:07:37,649 --> 00:07:40,721
- So it's a nice place to work?
- You know, I'm enjoying it very much.</i>

144
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:43,039
I think my coworkers
are really taking to me.</i>

145
00:07:43,209 --> 00:07:44,642
We're like a family.</i>

146
00:07:44,809 --> 00:07:47,687
In fact, yesterday
was Grace's birthday.</i>

147
00:07:48,329 --> 00:07:50,081
She's such a sweet woman.</i>

148
00:07:50,249 --> 00:07:54,003
We had a little party
with cak e and champagne.</i>

149
00:07:54,569 --> 00:07:56,161
I made a toast.</i>

150
00:07:57,489 --> 00:07:59,684
What about your boss,
the guy who interviewed you?</i>

151
00:08:00,089 --> 00:08:02,239
He'll be back on Monday.</i>

152
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:04,798
- Hi.
- Hey.</i>

153
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,207
How come you're wearing a hat?</i>

154
00:08:08,929 --> 00:08:10,248
I got a haircut.

155
00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:12,479
Oh, yeah? Can I see it?</i>

156
00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:14,517
There's nothing to see.</i>

157
00:08:14,689 --> 00:08:16,645
- Come on. Let me see it.
- Forget it.</i>

158
00:08:16,809 --> 00:08:19,198
Come on.</i>

159
00:08:19,809 --> 00:08:21,288
All right.

160
00:08:41,369 --> 00:08:42,518
Very good. Thank you.</i>

161
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,327
I'm sorry.

162
00:08:44,489 --> 00:08:46,286
I'm sorry.

163
00:08:47,809 --> 00:08:50,323
You can forget about me going
to that bachelor auction.</i>

164
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:52,918
What? No, Jerry. You have to go.</i>

165
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:55,683
You know, Elaine, I'd do it,
but I'm working that day.</i>

166
00:08:55,849 --> 00:08:58,124
Yeah. Too bad.</i>

167
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:05,040
This is the worst haircut
Jerry's ever had. You gotta fix it.</i>

168
00:09:05,249 --> 00:09:06,921
Sure.</i>

169
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:10,047
I fix. But you gotta make sure
you no tell anybody.</i>

170
00:09:10,729 --> 00:09:11,923
He's a little crazy.</i>

171
00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:15,001
I don't know what he do
if he find out I touch Jerry's hair.</i>

172
00:09:15,489 --> 00:09:17,798
So, I love that
Edward Scissorhands.</i>

173
00:09:17,969 --> 00:09:19,561
That's the best movie I ever see.</i>

174
00:09:20,489 --> 00:09:23,447
Again with the
Edward Scissorhands.</i>

175
00:09:23,609 --> 00:09:25,918
How can you have a hand
like a scissor?</i>

176
00:09:26,089 --> 00:09:28,284
Show me one person who's got
a hand like a scissor.</i>

177
00:09:28,449 --> 00:09:31,486
Hey, it's a beautiful dream.
I love to be this man.</i>

178
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:36,439
Did you ever think about what
you're going to do on the toilet?</i>

179
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:39,567
What are you going to do
on the toilet?!</i>

180
00:09:39,729 --> 00:09:42,368
I'd like to have shoehorn hands.</i>

181
00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:47,723
- Hey.
- Hey.</i>

182
00:09:47,889 --> 00:09:50,039
- Hey.
- Okay, now listen to me.</i>

183
00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:52,279
I talked to Gino. He'll fix the haircut.</i>

184
00:09:52,729 --> 00:09:55,004
Great. Then you can go
to the bachelor auction.</i>

185
00:09:55,169 --> 00:09:56,648
- Yeah, but-
- No buts.</i>

186
00:09:56,809 --> 00:09:59,084
His apartment tonight, 8:00.</i>

187
00:09:59,249 --> 00:10:02,207
- Can he fix it?
- I don't know.</i>

188
00:10:05,249 --> 00:10:09,800
Boy, you got a beautiful head of hair.</i>

189
00:10:09,969 --> 00:10:11,163
Well, thank you.</i>

190
00:10:11,329 --> 00:10:14,685
I bet Uncle Enzo,
he tell you that all the time.</i>

191
00:10:14,849 --> 00:10:18,478
Actually, Enzo hasn't said that
to me in a while.</i>

192
00:10:19,169 --> 00:10:23,685
I don't think Uncle Enzo realize
what a lucky barber he is.</i>

193
00:10:23,849 --> 00:10:26,238
That's nice of you to say.</i>

194
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:28,808
Just a second.</i>

195
00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:33,924
- Yes?
- It's your Uncle Enzo.</i>

196
00:10:35,449 --> 00:10:38,407
It's Uncle Enzo! Quick.
Go in there. I'll clean up.</i>

197
00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:41,877
Come on up.</i>

198
00:10:55,769 --> 00:10:57,839
Uncle Enzo,
what are you doing here?</i>

199
00:10:58,009 --> 00:11:00,807
- I come to apologize.
- Apologize?</i>

200
00:11:00,969 --> 00:11:03,688
I rented the movie
Edward Scissorhands.</i>

201
00:11:03,849 --> 00:11:06,238
That Johnny Depp, he make me cry.</i>

202
00:11:07,369 --> 00:11:10,327
He make me cry too.
You want something to drink?</i>

203
00:11:11,049 --> 00:11:14,200
Hey! What's all this?</i>

204
00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:17,125
Nothing. It's just hair.

205
00:11:17,769 --> 00:11:20,806
- You do haircut in the apartment?
- No.</i>

206
00:11:20,969 --> 00:11:23,847
Pizza man was here.
Maybe some fall off.</i>

207
00:11:24,009 --> 00:11:25,886
He's going bald.</i>

208
00:11:26,289 --> 00:11:28,849
It looks very familiar.</i>

209
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:38,882
In the one minute he worked on me,
I could tell he was good.</i>

210
00:11:39,049 --> 00:11:40,846
Yeah. Slow, gentle, attentive.</i>

211
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:42,681
- Yeah.
- Yeah.</i>

212
00:11:42,849 --> 00:11:46,159
- Didn't I tell you?
- But Enzo picked up one of my hairs.</i>

213
00:11:46,329 --> 00:11:48,001
- Yeah? So?
- I think he knew.</i>

214
00:11:48,169 --> 00:11:50,922
- No, he doesn't know.
- He knows my hair.</i>

215
00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:53,125
You're imagining things.
He doesn't know a thing.</i>

216
00:11:53,289 --> 00:11:56,804
- Come on. Pull yourself together.
- Okay, okay.</i>

217
00:11:59,689 --> 00:12:01,281
What happened?
It looks the same.</i>

218
00:12:01,449 --> 00:12:04,998
He didn't get to finish. His uncle
came in. We almost got caught!</i>

219
00:12:06,369 --> 00:12:09,361
Jerry, the auction is in a few hours.</i>

220
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:11,645
- Take the K-Man.
- Yeah.</i>

221
00:12:12,369 --> 00:12:14,121
You can still go.

222
00:12:14,569 --> 00:12:17,367
What, are you kidding?
Look at him. He's grotesque.</i>

223
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:20,362
- Do you think?
- Do I think? He's repugnant.</i>

224
00:12:25,049 --> 00:12:28,359
- What would you wear?
- Whatever it takes.</i>

225
00:12:31,129 --> 00:12:34,246
See, Newman is a good customer.</i>

226
00:12:34,409 --> 00:12:38,721
Once I find a barber, I stick with him.
I almost went to barber school.</i>

227
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:41,005
I always felt I had a talent for it.</i>

228
00:12:41,169 --> 00:12:43,729
Not everybody like Newman,
so loyal.</i>

229
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:46,483
Yeah, just the way that I was raised.</i>

230
00:12:46,889 --> 00:12:48,800
I'm special.</i>

231
00:12:49,489 --> 00:12:52,003
You know, I don't mind
if somebody's funny...</i>

232
00:12:52,169 --> 00:12:55,241
...but I no like the funny business.</i>

233
00:12:59,849 --> 00:13:01,646
I'm gonna go out for a little bit.</i>

234
00:13:01,809 --> 00:13:04,846
- I'll be right back.
- Take your time.</i>

235
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:11,363
You happy with the haircut?</i>

236
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:14,362
It's okay. A little crooked.</i>

237
00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:17,478
How you like to have a free haircut
for six months?</i>

238
00:13:17,649 --> 00:13:21,562
- What's the catch?
- You get me a sample of Jerry's hair.</i>

239
00:13:22,609 --> 00:13:24,804
That job sounds like
it might be worth...</i>

240
00:13:24,969 --> 00:13:29,679
...a year's free haircuts.
And a comb.</i>

241
00:13:37,169 --> 00:13:39,524
Mr. Costanza,
Mr. Pensky's here to see you.</i>

242
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:45,962
Mr. Pensky?</i>

243
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:47,403
Of the Pensky file?</i>

244
00:13:47,569 --> 00:13:49,287
Costanza?

245
00:13:49,449 --> 00:13:50,802
Arthur Pensky.</i>

246
00:13:50,969 --> 00:13:52,721
Mr. Pensky.</i>

247
00:13:53,449 --> 00:13:56,247
I- I was just working on your file.</i>

248
00:13:56,409 --> 00:13:57,603
I was...

249
00:13:57,769 --> 00:14:00,329
...transferring the contents
of the file into this...</i>

250
00:14:00,489 --> 00:14:02,844
...flexible, accordion-style folder to-</i>

251
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,159
- Where's Tuttle?
- He's on vacation.</i>

252
00:14:05,329 --> 00:14:09,004
He was on vacation the last time
I dropped by. Give me my file.</i>

253
00:14:13,049 --> 00:14:15,005
Looks like you put
a lot of work into this.</i>

254
00:14:15,649 --> 00:14:18,607
Well, in college they used to call me
"the little bulldog."</i>

255
00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:22,045
Yeah, you are Pensky material.</i>

256
00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:25,645
Would you ever consider
coming to work directly for me?</i>

257
00:14:25,809 --> 00:14:28,039
- Really?
- You are aware-</i>

258
00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:29,847
- Mr. Costanza?
- Not now, Clarisse.</i>

259
00:14:30,009 --> 00:14:33,319
I thought Mr. Pensky should know
they're towing his car.</i>

260
00:14:33,489 --> 00:14:34,888
Damn this city!

261
00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:37,483
I am aware...? I am aware...?</i>

262
00:14:39,009 --> 00:14:41,000
He knows. He knows about us.</i>

263
00:14:41,169 --> 00:14:42,727
- How do you know?
- Because I know.</i>

264
00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:47,405
He's crazy. All morning, he looking
at the hair. He staring at the hair.</i>

265
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:51,045
- Who is it?
- It's Newman!</i>

266
00:14:51,209 --> 00:14:53,723
He was in the shop with Enzo.
He can't see me here.</i>

267
00:14:53,889 --> 00:14:57,279
Go in the bedroom. Open the window.
You can go out the fire escape.</i>

268
00:15:01,449 --> 00:15:03,565
- What do you want?
- Could I use your bathroom?</i>

269
00:15:04,969 --> 00:15:06,402
What's wrong with yours?

270
00:15:06,569 --> 00:15:08,446
- My toilet's clogged.
- You can't unclog it?</i>

271
00:15:08,609 --> 00:15:10,042
- Did you ask Kramer?
- He's out.</i>

272
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:11,801
- Number one?
- Yes, yes.</i>

273
00:15:12,489 --> 00:15:13,638
- May I go?
- Go ahead.</i>

274
00:15:13,809 --> 00:15:15,640
- I gotta go very badly.
- Flush twice.</i>

275
00:15:15,809 --> 00:15:17,447
Thank you!

276
00:15:21,329 --> 00:15:22,887
No.</i>

277
00:15:23,049 --> 00:15:24,641
Jackpot.</i>

278
00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:27,526
I don't believe this.</i>

279
00:15:27,689 --> 00:15:29,327
There's no hair in this thing.</i>

280
00:15:29,489 --> 00:15:33,767
I've never seen a person that didn't
have at least one hair in a brush.</i>

281
00:15:35,049 --> 00:15:36,243
Unbelievable.</i>

282
00:15:36,409 --> 00:15:37,967
Nothing.</i>

283
00:15:48,689 --> 00:15:50,042
- All right?
- Yeah, yeah.</i>

284
00:15:50,209 --> 00:15:52,325
- I'll see you later.
- What are you doing?</i>

285
00:15:52,489 --> 00:15:54,127
I'm watching Edward Scissorhands.</i>

286
00:15:55,049 --> 00:15:57,927
Could I watch a little?
It's my favourite movie.</i>

287
00:15:58,609 --> 00:16:00,247
Yeah, all right.</i>

288
00:16:04,729 --> 00:16:07,482
- You want something to drink?
- No, no.</i>

289
00:16:15,449 --> 00:16:18,805
If you wanna watch, sit down.
You're making me nervous.</i>

290
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:24,804
I tell you, this Scissorhands
is a hell of a barber.</i>

291
00:16:24,969 --> 00:16:26,846
Gotta go.

292
00:16:27,089 --> 00:16:29,649
Oh, I dropped a nickel.</i>

293
00:16:30,409 --> 00:16:32,001
Yeah.</i>

294
00:16:32,169 --> 00:16:34,046
See you, Jerry.</i>

295
00:16:47,689 --> 00:16:49,486
Did you get it?</i>

296
00:16:54,169 --> 00:16:56,967
Oh, you done good, Newman.</i>

297
00:16:57,129 --> 00:16:59,040
It was a cinch.

298
00:16:59,209 --> 00:17:00,244
Where you going?</i>

299
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:14,201
Nine hundred!
Do I hear 1000?</i>

300
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:18,408
Ladies, he is a Harvard graduate.</i>

301
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:21,641
- A thousand.
- A thousand. Okay, a thousand once.</i>

302
00:17:21,809 --> 00:17:23,083
A thousand twice.</i>

303
00:17:23,249 --> 00:17:25,285
A thousand three times.
Sold...</i>

304
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:28,122
...to the lucky lady in the third row.</i>

305
00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:31,042
Congratulations.
Thank you so much.

306
00:17:31,729 --> 00:17:34,926
Okay, our next bachelor is number...</i>

307
00:17:35,089 --> 00:17:37,842
...124 on your program.

308
00:17:38,009 --> 00:17:39,442
He...</i>

309
00:17:41,129 --> 00:17:42,721
He is...</i>

310
00:17:42,889 --> 00:17:44,641
He's a high school graduate.</i>

311
00:17:44,809 --> 00:17:46,686
Equi...</i>

312
00:17:47,889 --> 00:17:49,845
Equivalency.</i>

313
00:17:50,009 --> 00:17:52,648
A high school equivalency
program graduate.</i>

314
00:17:53,609 --> 00:17:54,928
He's...</i>

315
00:17:55,089 --> 00:17:57,239
...self-employed.</i>

316
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,762
He's...</i>

317
00:17:58,929 --> 00:18:03,366
...I don't know, 6'3", 190 pounds.

318
00:18:03,969 --> 00:18:06,119
He likes...</i>

319
00:18:06,689 --> 00:18:08,520
...fruit.

320
00:18:08,969 --> 00:18:11,722
And he just got a haircut.</i>

321
00:18:13,689 --> 00:18:14,838
Kramer!</i>

322
00:18:15,009 --> 00:18:16,488
Kramer!</i>

323
00:18:17,369 --> 00:18:19,485
Okay, why don't we start
the bidding.</i>

324
00:18:20,889 --> 00:18:23,198
Do I hear 5 bucks?</i>

325
00:18:25,289 --> 00:18:29,282
I don't get this Scissorhands. Is he
a superhero? Like Green Lantern?</i>

326
00:18:29,449 --> 00:18:30,723
What's with this guy?

327
00:18:32,689 --> 00:18:34,486
I'm just asking.

328
00:18:35,969 --> 00:18:38,244
- Who is it?
- Enzo Manganero!</i>

329
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:40,320
Oh, my God!

330
00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:44,519
One second!
Go. Go in the bedroom.</i>

331
00:18:51,249 --> 00:18:54,161
It was you that was at Gino's
apartment the other night!</i>

332
00:18:54,329 --> 00:18:56,923
- No, I wasn't there.
- Don't lie!</i>

333
00:18:57,089 --> 00:18:58,408
I know it was you!

334
00:18:58,569 --> 00:19:00,958
I get a sample of your hair.
I match them up.</i>

335
00:19:01,129 --> 00:19:02,642
Sample?</i>

336
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,481
Newman.</i>

337
00:19:06,249 --> 00:19:08,888
I was there, but I was just
dropping off a book.</i>

338
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:10,198
Don't, Jerry.</i>

339
00:19:10,369 --> 00:19:12,519
So, it's true!</i>

340
00:19:12,689 --> 00:19:14,441
Yes.</i>

341
00:19:14,609 --> 00:19:16,361
Is true.</i>

342
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:19,687
I'm gonna kill the both of you!</i>

343
00:19:33,769 --> 00:19:35,839
Mr. Tuttle! You're back.</i>

344
00:19:36,449 --> 00:19:37,848
George.</i>

345
00:19:38,009 --> 00:19:39,920
I'm surprised to find you here.</i>

346
00:19:40,489 --> 00:19:43,845
- You are?
- I thought you'd take the larger office.</i>

347
00:19:46,169 --> 00:19:47,363
Really?</i>

348
00:19:47,529 --> 00:19:49,599
I guess I didn't make it clear
when I hired you.</i>

349
00:19:50,729 --> 00:19:53,163
So where's that Pensky file?</i>

350
00:19:53,729 --> 00:19:55,606
Let's see what you've been
up to all week.</i>

351
00:19:55,769 --> 00:19:56,963
Here it is.</i>

352
00:20:03,129 --> 00:20:04,642
What have you been
doing all week?</i>

353
00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:06,925
You missed a lovely party for Grace.</i>

354
00:20:07,089 --> 00:20:09,000
You haven't done anything with this.</i>

355
00:20:09,729 --> 00:20:12,562
Well, bear in mind,
I am in the smaller office.</i>

356
00:20:13,969 --> 00:20:17,006
I'm beginning to wonder
if you understand anything.</i>

357
00:20:17,169 --> 00:20:20,684
You are aware that Pensky
is interested in me.</i>

358
00:20:21,449 --> 00:20:23,121
You're not Pensky material.</i>

359
00:20:23,849 --> 00:20:28,479
Really? Well, we'll just
see about that.</i>

360
00:20:28,649 --> 00:20:31,880
Ta-ta, Tuttle.</i>

361
00:20:49,129 --> 00:20:50,448
Jerry.</i>

362
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:13,678
George, I'm sorry I gave you
the wrong impression.</i>

363
00:21:13,849 --> 00:21:15,601
What I was gonna say was:

364
00:21:15,769 --> 00:21:20,968
Now, you are aware that our
board of directors has been indicted...</i>

365
00:21:21,129 --> 00:21:22,448
...myself included.</i>

366
00:21:23,529 --> 00:21:28,000
We're prohibited from doing business
until the investigation is completed.</i>

367
00:21:28,169 --> 00:21:29,921
So obviously...

368
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:31,841
...we would have no use for you.</i>

369
00:21:32,649 --> 00:21:33,923
Obviously.

370
00:21:35,209 --> 00:21:38,963
- Yes?
- Mr. Costanza's car is being towed.</i>

371
00:21:45,809 --> 00:21:47,800
Subtitles by
SDl Media Group</i>

372
00:21:48,049 --> 00:21:49,721
So when are you gonna
be able to go out?</i>

373
00:21:49,889 --> 00:21:51,322
Not for a while.</i>
