1
00:00:02,209 --> 00:00:03,801
<i>At a hospital, the treatment
is to lie in a bed.</i>

2
00:00:05,129 --> 00:00:07,404
<i>Whatever's wrong with
a human being, lie down.</i>

3
00:00:07,569 --> 00:00:10,641
<i>Doctor never says, "Well, your
condition isn't as bad as we thought.</i>

4
00:00:10,809 --> 00:00:14,279
<i>We want you to kind of lean against
a doorjamb for seven to 10 days.</i>

5
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:16,201
<i>See how that feels."</i>

6
00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:18,599
<i>Always a bed. Unless you
go to the emergency room...</i>

7
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:21,237
<i>...then it's a chair. You've been shot,
stabbed, run over:</i>

8
00:00:21,409 --> 00:00:22,762
<i>"Have a seat."</i>

9
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:27,847
<i>There's always an interesting cultural,
ethnic mix to the hospital staff.</i>

10
00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:29,727
<i>It's like a local news team in there.</i>

11
00:00:29,889 --> 00:00:32,687
<i>The doctor's the anchorman.
He's got white hair, he's in charge.</i>

12
00:00:32,849 --> 00:00:34,760
<i>The nurse is the feature reporter,
you know.</i>

13
00:00:34,929 --> 00:00:38,604
<i>You listen to her, but it's always,
"And now, back to your doctor."</i>

14
00:00:38,769 --> 00:00:40,760
<i>The orderlies come in
with food and bedpans.</i>

15
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:43,045
<i>That's like your sports and weather.</i>

16
00:00:48,369 --> 00:00:51,042
<i>Then the baby's head comes out,
and I'm screaming.</i>

17
00:00:51,209 --> 00:00:53,245
<i>My brother, who's videotaping,
turns green.</i>

18
00:00:53,409 --> 00:00:55,445
<i>His eyes roll up in his head,
and he blacks out.</i>

19
00:00:55,609 --> 00:00:57,247
<i>He drops the camera,
the camera breaks.</i>

20
00:00:57,409 --> 00:01:00,128
<i>And then the placenta
comes flying out.</i>

21
00:01:02,369 --> 00:01:05,725
<i>- And then a doctor says-
- Hey, thanks. That's enough.</i>

22
00:01:05,889 --> 00:01:09,564
<i>Will you look at that kid. Sucking
away like there's no tomorrow.</i>

23
00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:12,527
Suck, suck, suck.

24
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:14,281
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

25
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:17,566
<i>- Look at that, Jerry, look at that.
- Yeah, I looked. I saw it.</i>

26
00:01:18,009 --> 00:01:20,967
<i>- Does this make you uncomfortable?
- No, no.</i>

27
00:01:21,129 --> 00:01:22,562
<i>Uncomfortable? Not at all.</i>

28
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:25,641
<i>My friend's wife's breasts are out.
Why would I be uncomfortable?</i>

29
00:01:25,809 --> 00:01:27,367
Look at him.

30
00:01:27,529 --> 00:01:29,565
<i>- So how long do they do this?
- Year or two.</i>

31
00:01:30,129 --> 00:01:31,801
<i>No break?</i>

32
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:35,603
<i>- After that comes the weaning.
- After sucking comes weaning?</i>

33
00:01:35,769 --> 00:01:37,680
<i>- First sucking, then weaning.
- You gotta wean.</i>

34
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:39,521
<i>- Gotta wean.
- Must wean.</i>

35
00:01:43,849 --> 00:01:47,080
<i>- What about that spot I got, huh?
- Yeah. I saw the spot.</i>

36
00:01:47,249 --> 00:01:48,602
<i>You open the door to the car...</i>

37
00:01:48,769 --> 00:01:51,806
<i>...you walk right into the hospital.
You can't beat that spot.</i>

38
00:01:52,689 --> 00:01:55,522
<i>I am on a roll. Yeah.</i>

39
00:01:55,689 --> 00:01:57,566
<i>I'm just willing these
great parking spots.</i>

40
00:01:57,729 --> 00:01:59,287
<i>George.</i>

41
00:02:00,849 --> 00:02:03,204
<i>Maybe the baby would
like to see the spot.</i>

42
00:02:03,369 --> 00:02:06,281
<i>A positive, uplifting message
to start his life out with, huh?</i>

43
00:02:06,449 --> 00:02:10,408
<i>You can still get a great spot
in this city if you apply yourself.</i>

44
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:12,161
<i>Where's Kramer?
Shouldn't he be here?</i>

45
00:02:12,329 --> 00:02:14,604
<i>- Did you give him the room number?
- Yeah, 1397.</i>

46
00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:17,237
1937.

47
00:02:18,249 --> 00:02:20,319
1937, 1937.

48
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:22,764
<i>Excuse me. Do you know
where the elevator is?</i>

49
00:02:22,929 --> 00:02:26,717
<i>Yeah, it's right around
the corner there. 1937.</i>

50
00:02:37,009 --> 00:02:38,920
Oh, God!

51
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:41,685
It's a pig-man.

52
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:44,518
A pig-man!

53
00:02:45,649 --> 00:02:48,766
<i>So anyway, Jerry, Elaine, we have
something we wanna ask you.</i>

54
00:02:48,929 --> 00:02:51,568
<i>You gotta look. I pulled
it in perfectly equidistant...</i>

55
00:02:51,729 --> 00:02:54,687
<i>- ... from the car in front and behind.
- Would you shut up, George?</i>

56
00:02:54,849 --> 00:02:57,409
<i>I'm taking a cab home.
I can't take this anymore.</i>

57
00:02:57,569 --> 00:02:59,799
<i>You were saying, Stan.
I'm sorry about this.</i>

58
00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:01,925
<i>Myra and I would like
you and Elaine...</i>

59
00:03:02,089 --> 00:03:04,205
<i>...to be the godparents of Steven.</i>

60
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:07,639
<i>- Me? A godfather?
- Yes.</i>

61
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:11,243
<i>Never go against the family, Elaine.</i>

62
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:13,957
What?

63
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:17,166
<i>Hey, I just saw a pig-man.
A pig-man.</i>

64
00:03:17,609 --> 00:03:20,123
<i>He was sleeping, and then
he woke up and he looked at me...</i>

65
00:03:20,289 --> 00:03:23,326
<i>...and he made
this horrible sound, this:</i>

66
00:03:26,529 --> 00:03:28,167
<i>Kramer, what are you talking about?</i>

67
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:31,719
<i>I'm talking about a pig-man. I walked
in the wrong room, and there he was.</i>

68
00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:35,484
- A pig-man?
- A pig-man. Half pig, half man.

69
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:36,923
<i>That's great, Kramer.</i>

70
00:03:37,089 --> 00:03:40,365
<i>Anyway, tell us what's involved
in being a godparent.</i>

71
00:03:40,529 --> 00:03:42,520
<i>Elaine, never ask me
about my business.</i>

72
00:03:43,689 --> 00:03:45,680
<i>Godfather?</i>

73
00:03:46,529 --> 00:03:48,759
<i>The most important thing
is you help with the bris.</i>

74
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:50,885
<i>- The bris?
- A bris?</i>

75
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:53,324
<i>- You mean, circumcision?
- Yeah.</i>

76
00:03:54,009 --> 00:03:56,443
<i>I would advise against that.</i>

77
00:03:57,409 --> 00:03:58,762
<i>Kramer, it's a tradition.</i>

78
00:03:58,929 --> 00:04:02,046
<i>So was sacrificing virgins
to appease the gods...</i>

79
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:05,804
<i>- ... but we don't do that anymore.
- Well, maybe we should.</i>

80
00:04:06,609 --> 00:04:07,803
<i>Hey...</i>

81
00:04:07,969 --> 00:04:10,483
<i>...why are all those people
milling around my car?</i>

82
00:04:10,649 --> 00:04:13,766
<i>- I don't know.
- Maybe they're admiring your spot.</i>

83
00:04:13,929 --> 00:04:17,319
<i>- They're looking up.
- Hey, there's a guy up on the roof.</i>

84
00:04:18,129 --> 00:04:20,882
<i>That's the guy I told
where the elevator was.</i>

85
00:04:22,769 --> 00:04:25,920
<i>Oh, God, I hope he doesn't jump-
Oh, my God!</i>

86
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:30,281
My car!

87
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:33,088
My car!

88
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:39,086
<i>A mohel? What the hell is a mohel?</i>

89
00:04:39,249 --> 00:04:42,207
<i>A mohel is the person that
performs a circumcision.</i>

90
00:04:42,369 --> 00:04:44,644
<i>Well, where am I gonna find
a mohel?</i>

91
00:04:44,809 --> 00:04:47,084
<i>Motels, models...</i>

92
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:50,004
<i>How do you find a mohel?</i>

93
00:04:50,529 --> 00:04:52,759
<i>Finding a mohel's easy.
Any idiot can find a mohel.</i>

94
00:04:52,929 --> 00:04:55,489
<i>I have to hold the baby
while they do it.</i>

95
00:04:55,649 --> 00:04:58,288
<i>That's a tough job.
How would you like that?</i>

96
00:04:58,569 --> 00:05:00,287
<i>Hey, Jerry, you ever seen one?</i>

97
00:05:01,049 --> 00:05:03,404
<i>- Oh, you mean, that wasn't...?
- Yeah.</i>

98
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:06,561
<i>- No, you?
- Yeah.</i>

99
00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:09,441
What'd you think?

100
00:05:11,289 --> 00:05:13,598
<i>It had no face, no personality.</i>

101
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:20,768
<i>It was like a Martian.</i>

102
00:05:21,409 --> 00:05:24,003
<i>- But, hey, you know, that's me.
- Hey.</i>

103
00:05:24,849 --> 00:05:26,282
<i>Well, I got the estimate.</i>

104
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:28,963
<i>It'll cost more to repair the roof
than the car is worth.</i>

105
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:31,689
<i>I'm going over and seeing
that hospital administrator today.</i>

106
00:05:31,849 --> 00:05:34,363
<i>Someone is gonna pay for this,
and it's not gonna be me!</i>

107
00:05:34,529 --> 00:05:37,248
<i>- Oh, you're screwed.
- I know.</i>

108
00:05:38,769 --> 00:05:42,205
<i>Swan dives from 20 floors up,
lands right on top.</i>

109
00:05:42,369 --> 00:05:44,678
<i>What, do I got a bull's-eye
up there?</i>

110
00:05:44,849 --> 00:05:47,363
<i>He couldn't move over
two feet, huh?</i>

111
00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:51,204
<i>Land on the sidewalk,
it's city property.</i>

112
00:05:51,649 --> 00:05:53,879
<i>Well, I have to interview a mohel.</i>

113
00:05:54,049 --> 00:05:56,199
<i>How about our little Elaine, huh?</i>

114
00:05:56,369 --> 00:05:58,758
<i>Attended the finest schools
on the eastern seaboard...</i>

115
00:05:58,929 --> 00:06:02,558
<i>...equestrian competitions,
debutante balls. Look at her now.</i>

116
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:05,243
<i>Interviewing mohels.</i>

117
00:06:06,129 --> 00:06:07,926
<i>Yeah!</i>

118
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:11,368
<i>- What's the matter?
- You all right?</i>

119
00:06:11,529 --> 00:06:14,999
<i>Don't ever question my instincts,
because my instincts are honed.</i>

120
00:06:15,169 --> 00:06:17,558
- Look at that. Look, look.
- What now?

121
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:20,448
<i>"Hospital receives grant
to conduct DNA research.</i>

122
00:06:20,609 --> 00:06:23,965
<i>Government funds genetic research
at area hospital."Yeah, so?</i>

123
00:06:24,129 --> 00:06:26,927
Pig-man, baby, pig-man.

124
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:30,407
<i>If I have to hear about this pig-man
one more time-</i>

125
00:06:30,569 --> 00:06:33,003
<i>Hey, I'm telling you,
the pig-man is alive.</i>

126
00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:36,445
<i>The government's been experimenting
with pig-men since the '50s.</i>

127
00:06:36,609 --> 00:06:38,918
<i>Just because the hospital's
conducting DNA research...</i>

128
00:06:39,089 --> 00:06:41,125
<i>...doesn't mean they're
creating mutant pig-men.</i>

129
00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:45,123
<i>Jerry, will you wake up to reality?
It's a military thing.</i>

130
00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:49,043
<i>They're probably creating
a whole army of pig warriors.</i>

131
00:06:51,929 --> 00:06:55,205
<i>I'll tell you something.
I wish there were pig-men.</i>

132
00:06:55,369 --> 00:06:59,248
<i>Get a few pig-men walking around,
suddenly I'm looking a lot better.</i>

133
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:03,527
<i>If someone wanted to fix me up, they
could say, "At least he's no pig-man."</i>

134
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:06,362
<i>Believe me, there'd be plenty
of women going for these pig-men.</i>

135
00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:09,841
<i>Whatever the deformity, there's
always some group attracted to it.</i>

136
00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:12,803
<i>"That little tail really turns me on."</i>

137
00:07:12,969 --> 00:07:14,846
<i>That's just about enough.</i>

138
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:17,569
<i>- This doesn't interest you?
- Oh, no, it's fascinating...</i>

139
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:19,082
<i>...but could you do me a favour?</i>

140
00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:20,678
<i>Could you tape...</i>

141
00:07:20,849 --> 00:07:24,000
<i>...the rest of the "pig-men and the
women who love them"discussion?</i>

142
00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:26,808
<i>And I'll listen to it
the next time I'm here.</i>

143
00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:28,607
<i>I gotta go find a mohel.</i>

144
00:07:28,769 --> 00:07:32,000
<i>You know, you should call that off,
Elaine. It's a barbaric ritual.</i>

145
00:07:32,929 --> 00:07:38,128
<i>Perhaps one day when the pig-men
roam free, it will be stopped, Kramer.</i>

146
00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:41,565
<i>Until then, off with their heads.</i>

147
00:07:43,609 --> 00:07:47,045
<i>- Kramer, isn't it a question of hygiene?
- It's a myth.</i>

148
00:07:47,409 --> 00:07:49,001
<i>Besides, it makes sex
more pleasurable.</i>

149
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:52,206
<i>Yeah. So how does that help me?</i>

150
00:07:52,369 --> 00:07:54,758
<i>- George, you ever see one?
- Yeah, my roommate in college.</i>

151
00:07:54,929 --> 00:07:56,760
<i>Yeah, what'd you think?</i>

152
00:07:57,409 --> 00:07:59,161
<i>I got used to it.</i>

153
00:08:01,409 --> 00:08:03,877
<i>All right, I wanna see the pig-man.
Show me the pig-man.</i>

154
00:08:04,049 --> 00:08:06,563
<i>Don't worry, I'll show you.
And you'll never be the same.</i>

155
00:08:06,729 --> 00:08:08,685
<i>Maybe he's just a guy
with a nose like this:</i>

156
00:08:08,849 --> 00:08:12,205
<i>A lot of people have a nose like this.
They're not necessarily pig-men.</i>

157
00:08:12,369 --> 00:08:14,519
<i>Believe me, Jerry,
somewhere in this hospital...</i>

158
00:08:14,689 --> 00:08:17,123
<i>...the anguished oink of pig-man
cries out for help.</i>

159
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:20,440
<i>Yeah, well, if I hear
an anguished oink, I'm out of here.</i>

160
00:08:20,609 --> 00:08:22,201
<i>I don't see any pig-men.</i>

161
00:08:22,529 --> 00:08:25,646
<i>I see human, human, human.</i>

162
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:26,958
<i>- Wait a second.
- What?</i>

163
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:29,165
<i>Oh, it's George.</i>

164
00:08:29,969 --> 00:08:32,802
<i>The administrator's on the third floor.
I'll meet you at the car.</i>

165
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:36,166
<i>Wait, George. You got room
in the car for the pig-man, huh?</i>

166
00:08:36,329 --> 00:08:38,445
<i>The pig-man can take the bus.</i>

167
00:08:38,609 --> 00:08:41,806
<i>George, if the pig-man had a car,
he would give you a ride.</i>

168
00:08:42,769 --> 00:08:45,567
<i>How do you know? What if
the pig-man had a two-seater?</i>

169
00:08:45,729 --> 00:08:48,004
<i>Be realistic, George.</i>

170
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:54,600
<i>I'll tell you what, if pig-man shows up,
we'll squeeze him in.</i>

171
00:08:54,929 --> 00:08:56,362
<i>- I'll see you later.
- Yeah.</i>

172
00:08:56,529 --> 00:08:59,407
<i>- Mr. Costanza, come in, come in.
- Thank you.</i>

173
00:08:59,569 --> 00:09:02,845
<i>It's been a very trying couple of days
around the hospital.</i>

174
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,569
<i>Doctors, patients, everyone...</i>

175
00:09:05,729 --> 00:09:08,641
<i>...just grief-stricken over
this unfortunate occurrence.</i>

176
00:09:08,809 --> 00:09:10,606
<i>Well, I join them in their grief.</i>

177
00:09:11,329 --> 00:09:15,720
<i>Horrible thing. Flew right
past the children's wing.</i>

178
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:19,848
<i>All the sick children in the playroom,
looking out the window...</i>

179
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:22,284
<i>...just traumatized by the incident.</i>

180
00:09:22,449 --> 00:09:25,919
<i>Apparently they thought he was flying.
You know how children are.</i>

181
00:09:26,089 --> 00:09:29,161
"Oh, look, a man is flying.
A man is flying!"

182
00:09:29,329 --> 00:09:31,604
<i>And then splat.</i>

183
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:34,204
<i>That's where I come in.</i>

184
00:09:34,369 --> 00:09:36,439
On "splat."

185
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:40,204
<i>You see, Mrs. Sweedler- Or is it
Hospital Administrator Sweedler?</i>

186
00:09:40,369 --> 00:09:43,600
<i>- Mrs. Sweedler is fine.
- Mrs. Sweedler. Thank you very much.</i>

187
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:48,843
<i>You see, this tragedy
has affected me in a very...</i>

188
00:09:49,009 --> 00:09:50,488
<i>A very personal way.</i>

189
00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:54,085
<i>- How is that?
- Yes, well, you see...</i>

190
00:09:54,249 --> 00:09:56,126
<i>...the deceased...</i>

191
00:09:56,289 --> 00:09:58,280
<i>...landed on my car.</i>

192
00:09:58,449 --> 00:10:03,921
<i>The splat, as it were, actually
occurred on the roof of my car.</i>

193
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:07,320
<i>Now, of course,
I can't help but feel that...</i>

194
00:10:07,489 --> 00:10:11,277
<i>...had it been a convertible, this whole
tragedy might have been averted.</i>

195
00:10:11,449 --> 00:10:14,407
<i>But I've never really been
the kind of guy to buy a convertible...</i>

196
00:10:14,569 --> 00:10:17,720
<i>...what with the baldness
and everything.</i>

197
00:10:18,289 --> 00:10:21,645
<i>Well, I have known bald men
who owned convertibles.</i>

198
00:10:21,809 --> 00:10:23,367
<i>They wore a hat.</i>

199
00:10:23,529 --> 00:10:28,045
<i>Yes, but then everything's all
pulled down, and it's- Anyway.</i>

200
00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:31,326
<i>The damage, unfortunately...</i>

201
00:10:31,489 --> 00:10:33,957
<i>...has marred an otherwise
fine automobile...</i>

202
00:10:34,129 --> 00:10:36,802
<i>...rendering it virtually undrivable.</i>

203
00:10:37,449 --> 00:10:39,167
<i>Yes, well, that is a shame.</i>

204
00:10:39,329 --> 00:10:43,038
<i>Yes. A shame.
That is exactly how I would put it.</i>

205
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:47,487
<i>Now, Mrs. Sweedler, with all
due discretion and sensitivity...</i>

206
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:50,925
<i>...and taking in the whole scope
of the situation...</i>

207
00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:53,398
<i>...I just can't help but think...</i>

208
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:57,562
<i>...that the hospital is somehow
responsible for compensating...</i>

209
00:10:57,729 --> 00:11:03,599
<i>...the other still-living victim of this
horrendous, horrendous tragedy.</i>

210
00:11:04,249 --> 00:11:05,967
<i>- Mr. Costanza.
- Yes.</i>

211
00:11:06,129 --> 00:11:09,565
<i>A man plummeted tragically
to his ultimate demise...</i>

212
00:11:09,729 --> 00:11:12,846
<i>- Yes.
- ... and you greedily, callously...</i>

213
00:11:13,009 --> 00:11:15,125
...want to profit from it?

214
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:17,445
<i>Well, profit...</i>

215
00:11:17,609 --> 00:11:22,558
<i>I think you'll see from the estimate
that I'm not really profiting that much.</i>

216
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:25,085
<i>It might be a little high, but...</i>

217
00:11:25,249 --> 00:11:28,958
<i>Get out. Get out now.
Get out of my office!</i>

218
00:11:31,489 --> 00:11:33,400
<i>- Should I just leave-?
- Get out!</i>

219
00:11:34,929 --> 00:11:36,760
This is it.

220
00:11:45,249 --> 00:11:46,443
<i>Wait, excuse me.</i>

221
00:11:47,049 --> 00:11:49,517
<i>What happened to the guy
that was in there before?</i>

222
00:11:49,689 --> 00:11:53,477
<i>- I don't know what you're talking-
- No, you know. He had this:</i>

223
00:11:54,409 --> 00:11:55,728
<i>- He was...
- No.</i>

224
00:11:55,889 --> 00:11:57,481
<i>This doesn't look familiar to you?</i>

225
00:11:57,649 --> 00:12:01,847
- Sir-
- Look, I know what's going on.

226
00:12:02,009 --> 00:12:04,398
<i>The oink, oink.</i>

227
00:12:04,569 --> 00:12:06,605
<i>Yes, if you'll excuse me,
I have some patients-</i>

228
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:08,043
<i>Listen, you little quack.</i>

229
00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:11,679
<i>There was a half man, half pig in that
room over there. Now, where is he?</i>

230
00:12:11,849 --> 00:12:13,328
<i>- Where is he?!
- Half what?</i>

231
00:12:13,489 --> 00:12:16,242
<i>You know what I mean!
Pork. Sausage.</i>

232
00:12:16,409 --> 00:12:18,684
"That's all, folks."

233
00:12:19,329 --> 00:12:23,083
<i>I think he's been released.</i>

234
00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:25,882
Good.

235
00:12:26,049 --> 00:12:28,358
<i>- He's lying!
- All right, enough of this.</i>

236
00:12:28,529 --> 00:12:31,521
<i>- I gotta go find George.
- All right, you go ahead.</i>

237
00:12:31,689 --> 00:12:33,247
<i>Kramer.</i>

238
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:40,806
<i>- Where's the mohel?
- He'll be here.</i>

239
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:42,766
<i>- He's late already.
- Relax.</i>

240
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,489
<i>You'd think you were
getting whacked.</i>

241
00:12:46,529 --> 00:12:48,485
<i>I don't know why he asked me
to be godfather.</i>

242
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:51,004
<i>We're not close. Because
we're on the softball team...</i>

243
00:12:51,169 --> 00:12:54,206
<i>...I'm pitcher, he's catcher, he thinks
we have a special relationship?</i>

244
00:12:54,369 --> 00:12:56,803
<i>I thought pitchers and catchers
had a special rapport.</i>

245
00:12:56,969 --> 00:13:00,518
<i>Maybe in hardball, with all the signals,
but I'm just lobbing it in.</i>

246
00:13:00,689 --> 00:13:01,838
<i>We don't have conferences.</i>

247
00:13:02,009 --> 00:13:04,443
<i>He doesn't come out to the mound
and encourage me.</i>

248
00:13:04,609 --> 00:13:08,045
<i>What about me? I just watched
a few games with her in the stands.</i>

249
00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:11,201
<i>Don't they have friends? They're
level-jumping on our friendship.</i>

250
00:13:11,369 --> 00:13:13,325
<i>Yes, it is level-jumping.</i>

251
00:13:18,609 --> 00:13:20,520
So...

252
00:13:20,689 --> 00:13:22,088
<i>...you been to a bris before?</i>

253
00:13:23,049 --> 00:13:24,687
No.

254
00:13:25,169 --> 00:13:26,966
<i>I've been to a few of them.</i>

255
00:13:27,729 --> 00:13:31,688
<i>If you start to get woozy later,
which is quite common...</i>

256
00:13:31,849 --> 00:13:34,443
<i>...stay close to me.
I'll get you through it.</i>

257
00:13:34,609 --> 00:13:37,123
<i>I'm a cardiologist. I think I'll manage.</i>

258
00:13:39,329 --> 00:13:40,967
<i>We're not talking about a manicure.</i>

259
00:13:41,129 --> 00:13:43,120
<i>Imagine, this is gonna
be his first memory...</i>

260
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:46,281
<i>...of his parents just standing there
while some stranger...</i>

261
00:13:46,449 --> 00:13:50,920
<i>...cuts off a piece of his manhood
and then serves a catered lunch.</i>

262
00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:53,319
<i>- Myra?
- She'll be okay.</i>

263
00:13:54,049 --> 00:13:56,324
<i>- Kramer, what's the matter with you?
- Me?</i>

264
00:13:56,489 --> 00:13:58,445
<i>- Oh, that's the mohel.
- He's here.</i>

265
00:13:59,849 --> 00:14:00,998
<i>It's about time.</i>

266
00:14:01,169 --> 00:14:02,363
<i>- Hi.
- Hello.</i>

267
00:14:02,529 --> 00:14:04,167
<i>- Hello, I'm the mohel.
- Oh, hello.</i>

268
00:14:04,329 --> 00:14:06,399
<i>It's very nice to meet you all.</i>

269
00:14:06,569 --> 00:14:08,685
<i>What was that? Jeez,
it scared the hell out of me!</i>

270
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:11,966
<i>I mean, my God,
I almost had a heart attack!</i>

271
00:14:12,129 --> 00:14:14,563
<i>Okay, I'm fine, I'm fine. Anyway...</i>

272
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:18,278
<i>...we're here to perform
the mitzvah of the bris.</i>

273
00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:21,723
<i>Is the baby gonna cry like that?
Is that how he cries...</i>

274
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:25,438
<i>...with that loud, sustained, squealing
cry? That could pose a problem.</i>

275
00:14:25,609 --> 00:14:27,247
<i>Do have any control over your child?</i>

276
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:30,207
<i>This would be the time to exercise it,
when baby is crying...</i>

277
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:34,681
<i>...in that high-pitched squealing tone
that can drive you insane!</i>

278
00:14:37,289 --> 00:14:39,849
<i>- Did you find the place all right?
- Did I find it all right?</i>

279
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:41,806
<i>Could you send me to
a more dangerous area?</i>

280
00:14:41,969 --> 00:14:43,721
<i>I'm dreading walking back
to the subway...</i>

281
00:14:43,889 --> 00:14:46,005
<i>...someone shouldn't smack me
and steal my bag.</i>

282
00:14:46,169 --> 00:14:49,479
<i>Because I'll be lying there, and people
will spit on me and empty my pockets.</i>

283
00:14:49,649 --> 00:14:53,961
<i>I'll be lying in the gutter like a bum,
a dog, a mutt, a mongrel, an animal!</i>

284
00:14:54,129 --> 00:14:56,484
<i>God forbid anybody should
help me or call an ambulance.</i>

285
00:14:56,649 --> 00:14:59,641
<i>That's too much trouble, to pick
up a phone and press a few buttons.</i>

286
00:14:59,809 --> 00:15:01,720
<i>What's the point?</i>

287
00:15:03,049 --> 00:15:05,404
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

288
00:15:05,569 --> 00:15:07,639
<i>Darling, you see where
that glass is?</i>

289
00:15:07,809 --> 00:15:09,322
<i>See how the glass
is near the edge?</i>

290
00:15:09,489 --> 00:15:11,400
<i>You've got the whole table
to put the glass.</i>

291
00:15:11,569 --> 00:15:16,279
<i>Why you chose the absolute edge so
half the glass is hanging off the table.</i>

292
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:19,646
<i>You breathe, and it falls over. Then
you've got broken glass on the carpet.</i>

293
00:15:19,809 --> 00:15:24,087
<i>Embedded in the carpet fibres,
deep in the shag, broken glass.</i>

294
00:15:24,249 --> 00:15:26,285
<i>Bits of broken glass
you can never get up.</i>

295
00:15:26,449 --> 00:15:27,723
<i>Can't get it up with a vacuum.</i>

296
00:15:27,889 --> 00:15:29,959
<i>Even on your knees
with a magnifying glass...</i>

297
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:32,643
<i>...you'll never get all the pieces.
You think you got it.</i>

298
00:15:32,809 --> 00:15:34,527
<i>Two years later, you're barefoot...</i>

299
00:15:34,689 --> 00:15:36,680
<i>...you step on broken glass
and kill yourself!</i>

300
00:15:36,849 --> 00:15:40,205
Is that what you want? I don't think
that's what you want. Do you?

301
00:15:45,289 --> 00:15:47,678
<i>He's very highly recommended,
so...</i>

302
00:15:48,049 --> 00:15:49,801
<i>You're holding the baby?</i>

303
00:15:49,969 --> 00:15:52,005
<i>- No, no.
- Hello. Who's holding the baby?</i>

304
00:15:52,169 --> 00:15:54,763
<i>- Who's holding the baby?!
- Jerry is. Jerry, do you wanna...?</i>

305
00:15:54,929 --> 00:15:56,328
<i>Yeah. I'm holding the baby.</i>

306
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:59,799
- Okay, go.
- I'm going. All right, I am. I'm going.

307
00:15:59,969 --> 00:16:01,641
<i>- Don't push me.
- Okay, you sit there.</i>

308
00:16:01,809 --> 00:16:03,765
<i>Now I need the baby.
Bring me the baby.</i>

309
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:05,965
<i>I need the baby!</i>

310
00:16:06,609 --> 00:16:10,397
<i>- No, I'm not gonna let them.
- What are you doing? Come back!</i>

311
00:16:12,369 --> 00:16:16,123
<i>People, people. Compose yourself.
This is a bris!</i>

312
00:16:16,289 --> 00:16:18,678
<i>We're performing a bris here,
not a burlesque show.</i>

313
00:16:18,849 --> 00:16:23,161
<i>This is not a school play. This is not
a baggy-pants farce. This is a bris!</i>

314
00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:25,001
<i>A sacred, ancient ceremony...</i>

315
00:16:25,169 --> 00:16:28,206
<i>...symbolizing the covenant
between God and Abraham.</i>

316
00:16:28,369 --> 00:16:30,200
<i>Or something.</i>

317
00:16:31,249 --> 00:16:33,888
No, don't touch anything.
Don't touch a thing.

318
00:16:34,489 --> 00:16:37,208
<i>I could have been a kosher butcher
like my brother.</i>

319
00:16:37,369 --> 00:16:40,486
<i>The money's good.
It's got a union with benefits.</i>

320
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:42,207
<i>And cows don't have families.</i>

321
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:45,327
<i>You make a mistake with a cow,
you move on with your life.</i>

322
00:16:46,609 --> 00:16:48,361
Anyway.

323
00:16:54,609 --> 00:16:57,487
<i>- Hurry up, George. Step on it!
- All right, all right.</i>

324
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:59,560
<i>That damn mohel!
He circumcised my finger.</i>

325
00:16:59,729 --> 00:17:02,607
<i>- The mohel circumcised my finger.
- You flinched.</i>

326
00:17:02,769 --> 00:17:05,237
<i>Flinched? I did not flinch.
George, did I flinch?</i>

327
00:17:05,409 --> 00:17:08,287
<i>Oh, how would he know?
He blacked out. He fainted.</i>

328
00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:10,121
<i>It was very traumatic.</i>

329
00:17:10,289 --> 00:17:13,247
<i>Last thing I remember was you
flinching. Then everything went black.</i>

330
00:17:13,409 --> 00:17:15,639
<i>Who's got tissues?
I need more tissues.</i>

331
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:17,640
<i>Look at this thing.
It's my phone finger!</i>

332
00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:20,721
<i>- Careful. You're getting blood all over.
- What about the baby?</i>

333
00:17:20,889 --> 00:17:23,562
<i>The baby's fine. They took him
to the hospital as a precaution.</i>

334
00:17:23,729 --> 00:17:25,367
<i>But look at me.
I'm the one who's hurt!</i>

335
00:17:25,529 --> 00:17:28,202
<i>Will you stop it? You're just
gonna need a few stitches.</i>

336
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:30,280
<i>A few stitches?
I've never had stitches.</i>

337
00:17:30,729 --> 00:17:32,526
<i>I'll be deformed. I can't live with that.</i>

338
00:17:32,689 --> 00:17:34,486
<i>Goes against my personality.
It's not me.</i>

339
00:17:34,649 --> 00:17:37,959
<i>Hey, look at that.
Boy, are you lucky!</i>

340
00:17:38,129 --> 00:17:40,040
<i>Another great spot
in front of the hospital.</i>

341
00:17:40,209 --> 00:17:42,848
<i>In an emergency yet!
How lucky are you, huh?</i>

342
00:17:43,009 --> 00:17:46,479
<i>Is that unbelievable?
How unbelievable is that, huh?</i>

343
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,799
<i>Come on, give it to me.
Give it to me.</i>

344
00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:54,002
<i>- I've never seen a mohel like that.
- That was a one-in-a-million mohel.</i>

345
00:17:54,169 --> 00:17:55,568
- I said I'm sorry.
- Look at this.

346
00:17:55,729 --> 00:17:59,517
<i>- You'll be okay. I'll see you later, huh?
- Where is he going?</i>

347
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,524
I'm gonna look for a bathroom.

348
00:18:04,809 --> 00:18:06,686
<i>Well, if it isn't Shaky the Mohel.</i>

349
00:18:06,849 --> 00:18:09,488
<i>Nice circumcision, but it's not
supposed to be a finger.</i>

350
00:18:09,649 --> 00:18:12,322
<i>Circumcision was perfect.
That was your fault. You flinched!</i>

351
00:18:12,489 --> 00:18:15,162
<i>Oh, who made you a mohel? You
get your degree from a matchbook?</i>

352
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:17,320
<i>You see? He flinched again.</i>

353
00:18:17,489 --> 00:18:19,081
<i>Nice. You picked a hell of a mohel!</i>

354
00:18:19,249 --> 00:18:21,763
<i>One more peep, and I'll slice you
like a smoked sturgeon.</i>

355
00:18:21,929 --> 00:18:24,682
<i>- Oh, don't threaten me, butcher boy.
- Butcher boy?</i>

356
00:18:24,849 --> 00:18:26,407
<i>Yeah, what was this?</i>

357
00:18:26,569 --> 00:18:28,321
What was this?
What was this, huh?

358
00:18:28,689 --> 00:18:30,680
<i>Careful, Jerry,
the mohel's got a knife!</i>

359
00:18:30,849 --> 00:18:32,760
<i>Hey, what's going on out here?</i>

360
00:18:32,929 --> 00:18:34,920
<i>You should be ashamed of yourself,
both of you.</i>

361
00:18:35,089 --> 00:18:37,808
<i>- Blood.
- Oh, how's the baby?</i>

362
00:18:37,969 --> 00:18:40,802
<i>- There's nothing wrong with the baby.
- The circumcision went fine.</i>

363
00:18:40,969 --> 00:18:44,086
<i>Thank God the flincher
didn't harm the baby.</i>

364
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:46,558
<i>I'll get you for this.
This is my business, my life!</i>

365
00:18:46,729 --> 00:18:48,765
<i>No one ruins it for me, no one!</i>

366
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:50,487
<i>Here's my card.</i>

367
00:18:50,649 --> 00:18:52,958
<i>Get out of my way!</i>

368
00:19:04,369 --> 00:19:06,166
I can't do it.

369
00:19:06,329 --> 00:19:10,766
<i>Look what they did to my boy.
They massacred my boy.</i>

370
00:19:10,929 --> 00:19:15,923
<i>You really do the worst Godfather
I've ever heard. You're not even close.</i>

371
00:19:17,329 --> 00:19:19,240
<i>Oh, that's the flicks.</i>

372
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:21,286
<i>It's a '76 Chevy Impala.</i>

373
00:19:21,449 --> 00:19:24,009
<i>They stole it right in front
of the hospital.</i>

374
00:19:24,409 --> 00:19:27,082
<i>I saw the guy drive off in it.</i>

375
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:30,719
<i>Well, he's about 5 feet tall...</i>

376
00:19:30,889 --> 00:19:32,641
<i>...hairless...</i>

377
00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:35,039
<i>...pink complexion.</i>

378
00:19:35,209 --> 00:19:37,518
<i>Looks like a pig.</i>

379
00:19:37,689 --> 00:19:39,520
<i>Yeah, all right, thank you.
Thank you.</i>

380
00:19:40,369 --> 00:19:41,688
<i>Yeah.</i>

381
00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:45,645
<i>So any word from the pig-man?</i>

382
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:47,640
- No.
- No.

383
00:19:47,809 --> 00:19:50,721
<i>And he's not a pig-man, is he?</i>

384
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:55,087
<i>No, he's not. He's just
a fat little mental patient.</i>

385
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:57,757
Myra. Stan.

386
00:19:58,129 --> 00:19:59,881
<i>- Don't touch him.
- What's the matter?</i>

387
00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:03,041
<i>You're out, Jerry. Out as godfather.
You too, Elaine. You're both out.</i>

388
00:20:03,209 --> 00:20:06,724
<i>- But I didn't do any-
- No buts. We've made up our minds.</i>

389
00:20:07,369 --> 00:20:11,328
<i>We want Kramer. He showed us
how much he cares about Steven.</i>

390
00:20:13,889 --> 00:20:17,040
<i>Don't ever go against the family,
Jerry.</i>

391
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:24,368
<i>Godfather.</i>

392
00:20:24,529 --> 00:20:26,918
<i>- Godfather.
- Yes.</i>

393
00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:44,719
<i>To me, what's really amazing, that for
every job that there is in the world...</i>

394
00:20:44,889 --> 00:20:46,686
<i>...there's someone willing to do it.</i>

395
00:20:46,849 --> 00:20:49,488
<i>Someone goes, "I will stand in
the tunnel breathing exhaust...</i>

396
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:52,368
<i>...watching the cars go by,
making sure everything's okay."</i>

397
00:20:52,529 --> 00:20:56,408
<i>Someone goes, "I will work behind
the elephant with the big shovel."</i>

398
00:20:56,569 --> 00:20:58,799
<i>Doctors go, "Yes, I will
confine myself...</i>

399
00:20:58,969 --> 00:21:01,961
<i>...to one particularly objectionable
part of the human body...</i>

400
00:21:02,129 --> 00:21:06,327
<i>...all day, every day. I will do it."</i>

401
00:21:06,569 --> 00:21:10,448
<i>I think people that are unemployed
are not really unable to find work...</i>

402
00:21:10,609 --> 00:21:12,406
<i>...they're just easily disgusted.</i>

403
00:21:12,569 --> 00:21:15,561
<i>"Yes, I'm starving, and my family
has no clothing or shelter...</i>

404
00:21:15,729 --> 00:21:18,163
<i>...but I'm not cleaning that up."</i>
