1
00:00:01,994 --> 00:00:04,224
How about the seedless
watermelon? What an invention.

2
00:00:04,394 --> 00:00:05,952
Scientists are working on this.

3
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:10,068
Other scientists devote their lives
to fighting cancer, AIDS.

4
00:00:10,234 --> 00:00:12,748
These guys go,
"No, I'm focusing on melon.

5
00:00:12,914 --> 00:00:15,144
Oh, sure, thousands of people
are dying needlessly...

6
00:00:15,314 --> 00:00:17,953
...but this, that's gotta stop.

7
00:00:19,834 --> 00:00:23,509
You ever try and pick a wet one up
off the floor? It's almost impossible.

8
00:00:23,674 --> 00:00:25,744
I'm devoting my life to that."

9
00:00:26,114 --> 00:00:29,948
So I guess if they can get rid
of the seeds, the rind is going next.

10
00:00:30,114 --> 00:00:32,309
What do we need that for?
They're not gonna stop...

11
00:00:32,474 --> 00:00:34,544
...until they're making
ready-to-eat fruit cups...

12
00:00:34,714 --> 00:00:36,625
...growing right out of the ground.

13
00:00:42,394 --> 00:00:44,191
- So, what's her name?
- Karen.

14
00:00:44,354 --> 00:00:45,582
- She nice?
- Great.

15
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,267
- So you like her?
- I think so.

16
00:00:48,074 --> 00:00:49,792
You don't know?

17
00:00:49,954 --> 00:00:52,149
I can't tell anymore.

18
00:00:52,554 --> 00:00:55,273
- Well, do you feel anything?
- Feel? What's that?

19
00:00:56,994 --> 00:00:59,827
Let me ask you this. When she
comes over, you cleaning up a lot?

20
00:00:59,994 --> 00:01:01,586
- Yeah.
- Straightening up or cleaning?

21
00:01:01,754 --> 00:01:03,028
- Cleaning.
- You do the tub?

22
00:01:03,194 --> 00:01:05,310
- Yeah.
- On your knees, Ajax...

23
00:01:05,474 --> 00:01:07,590
- ... hands, scrubbing, the whole deal?
- Yeah.

24
00:01:07,754 --> 00:01:09,745
Okay. I think you're in love.

25
00:01:11,274 --> 00:01:13,583
- Tub is love?
- Tub is love.

26
00:01:14,834 --> 00:01:16,950
You got a nice girl
and a clean apartment.

27
00:01:17,114 --> 00:01:18,706
Yep.

28
00:01:18,874 --> 00:01:20,785
Just one little problem.

29
00:01:21,754 --> 00:01:23,665
- Sexual?
- Yeah.

30
00:01:27,834 --> 00:01:29,347
Well...

31
00:01:30,394 --> 00:01:34,910
...I've never really felt confident...

32
00:01:35,754 --> 00:01:38,712
...in one particular aspect.

33
00:01:40,754 --> 00:01:43,109
- Below the equator?
- Yeah.

34
00:01:47,354 --> 00:01:49,424
Nobody does.

35
00:01:50,074 --> 00:01:52,144
You know, nobody knows
what to do.

36
00:01:52,314 --> 00:01:55,351
You just close your eyes,
you hope for the best.

37
00:01:56,514 --> 00:01:58,948
I really think they're happy
if you just make an effort.

38
00:02:00,794 --> 00:02:02,705
I don't know.

39
00:02:03,394 --> 00:02:05,350
Last time I got the tap.

40
00:02:06,834 --> 00:02:08,552
You got the tap?

41
00:02:08,834 --> 00:02:12,190
You're going along,
you think everything's all right...

42
00:02:12,354 --> 00:02:15,551
...and all of a sudden
you get that tap.

43
00:02:17,994 --> 00:02:20,667
It's like, "All right, that's enough.
You're through."

44
00:02:20,834 --> 00:02:22,233
Yeah.

45
00:02:22,754 --> 00:02:25,222
- The tap is tough.
- It's like the manager coming out...

46
00:02:25,394 --> 00:02:27,908
- ... and asking you for the ball.
- Yeah.

47
00:02:28,634 --> 00:02:30,590
Maybe she wanted to move on
to other business.

48
00:02:30,754 --> 00:02:32,745
No, no, this wasn't moving on.

49
00:02:33,234 --> 00:02:35,429
I got the hook.

50
00:02:35,594 --> 00:02:37,550
I wish I could get a lesson in that.

51
00:02:37,914 --> 00:02:39,825
It's a very complicated area.

52
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:42,349
You could go crazy trying
to figure that place out.

53
00:02:42,754 --> 00:02:45,188
It's a hazy mystery.

54
00:02:45,354 --> 00:02:47,185
Anyway, I think everything else
is okay...

55
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,984
...unless, of course, she's faking.

56
00:02:50,154 --> 00:02:52,543
- Who's faking?
- Nothing.

57
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,386
- Faking what?
- Nobody's faking.

58
00:02:55,194 --> 00:02:58,186
- Orgasms?
- She's not faking.

59
00:02:58,874 --> 00:03:01,434
- How do you know?
- I know. I can tell.

60
00:03:01,594 --> 00:03:03,585
It's one of my powers.

61
00:03:04,194 --> 00:03:05,593
Why? Did you ever fake?

62
00:03:05,914 --> 00:03:07,313
- Of course.
- Really?

63
00:03:08,034 --> 00:03:10,070
- You've faked?
- On occasion.

64
00:03:10,234 --> 00:03:12,270
- And the guy never knows?
- No.

65
00:03:12,434 --> 00:03:14,311
How can he not know that?

66
00:03:14,474 --> 00:03:16,783
Because I was good.

67
00:03:17,554 --> 00:03:21,069
I guess after that many beers,
he's probably a little groggy anyway.

68
00:03:23,274 --> 00:03:26,232
Well, you didn't know.

69
00:03:28,194 --> 00:03:29,912
What's that?

70
00:03:30,554 --> 00:03:32,465
You didn't know.

71
00:03:32,834 --> 00:03:36,543
- Are you saying-?
- I think I'll have a piece of cake.

72
00:03:36,714 --> 00:03:38,147
- With me?
- Well...

73
00:03:38,314 --> 00:03:40,145
- You faked with me?
- Yeah.

74
00:03:40,314 --> 00:03:41,747
- You faked with me?
- Yes.

75
00:03:41,914 --> 00:03:44,144
- No. You faked it?
- Yes. I faked it.

76
00:03:44,314 --> 00:03:46,874
That whole thing, the whole
production, it was all an act?

77
00:03:47,434 --> 00:03:49,584
Not bad, huh?

78
00:03:49,754 --> 00:03:52,587
What about the breathing, the panting,
the moaning, the screaming?

79
00:03:52,754 --> 00:03:55,268
Fake, fake, fake, fake.

80
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,788
I'm stunned. I'm shocked.

81
00:03:59,074 --> 00:04:01,269
How many times did you do this?

82
00:04:02,714 --> 00:04:04,545
- All the time.
- All the time?

83
00:04:05,034 --> 00:04:07,423
I think I'll have
a chocolate malted here.

84
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:09,670
But I'm so good.

85
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:11,108
I'm sure you are.

86
00:04:11,514 --> 00:04:14,392
Jerry, listen, it wasn't you.
I just didn't have them back then.

87
00:04:15,554 --> 00:04:17,431
She faked.

88
00:04:20,514 --> 00:04:23,312
- Maybe they've all been faking.
- I'm sure they're not.

89
00:04:23,994 --> 00:04:26,349
Maybe Karen is faking.

90
00:04:29,314 --> 00:04:32,670
- She was probably joking.
- No, no. It was no joke.

91
00:04:32,834 --> 00:04:34,950
- She didn't have any?
- No, none.

92
00:04:35,114 --> 00:04:38,151
- She faked them all?
- Faked them all.

93
00:04:40,594 --> 00:04:42,232
Well, so she faked them. So what?

94
00:04:42,394 --> 00:04:45,431
The woman had an orgasm
under false pretences.

95
00:04:45,594 --> 00:04:47,983
That's sexual perjury.

96
00:04:48,474 --> 00:04:51,511
You know, I heard her screaming
from my apartment.

97
00:04:52,354 --> 00:04:53,673
She woke me up a few times.

98
00:04:53,834 --> 00:04:56,553
How did she do it?
She's like Meryl Streep, this woman.

99
00:04:56,714 --> 00:04:58,272
And I know how to work
the equipment.

100
00:04:58,434 --> 00:04:59,992
I'm not unskilled, I'm in the union.

101
00:05:00,154 --> 00:05:02,793
I mean, if she'd told me,
maybe I could have done something.

102
00:05:02,954 --> 00:05:04,945
Yeah, I could've helped you out.

103
00:05:08,354 --> 00:05:11,505
- What could you have done?
- I could've given you some pointers.

104
00:05:11,674 --> 00:05:14,632
I know how to press those buttons,
buddy.

105
00:05:18,194 --> 00:05:21,869
Well, I'm feeling very inadequate
about the whole thing. Don't:

106
00:05:22,034 --> 00:05:25,344
I'm supposed to do something with
her later. I don't even wanna see her.

107
00:05:27,474 --> 00:05:28,873
Hello?

108
00:05:29,034 --> 00:05:30,672
Oh, hello, Elaine.

109
00:05:31,354 --> 00:05:32,628
So we having dinner tonight?

110
00:05:32,794 --> 00:05:34,864
I don't know.
I'm not really in the mood.

111
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:36,387
Why? What's wrong?

112
00:05:36,674 --> 00:05:38,869
You're not still thinking
about earlier, are you?

113
00:05:39,034 --> 00:05:41,867
What, the grilled cheese?
No, they always burn the toast.

114
00:05:43,034 --> 00:05:44,433
No, the other thing.

115
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:47,108
Oh, that. Well...

116
00:05:47,274 --> 00:05:50,391
Oh, come on, Jerry. You're making
too much of a big deal about it.

117
00:05:50,554 --> 00:05:53,352
- I guess. So you wanna meet at 7:30?
- Okay.

118
00:05:53,514 --> 00:05:56,551
- All right. Bye.
- All right, see you later. Bye.

119
00:05:57,034 --> 00:05:59,070
Renee, can you
come here a second?

120
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:01,065
Let me ask you something.

121
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:04,904
Have you ever, you know...

122
00:06:05,794 --> 00:06:08,103
- ... faked it?
- Yeah, sometimes.

123
00:06:08,274 --> 00:06:10,868
- Really, like when?
- If we went to a Broadway show...

124
00:06:11,034 --> 00:06:14,549
- ... if we had really good seats.
- Yeah, well...

125
00:06:19,034 --> 00:06:21,912
You know, if it's enough already,
and I just wanna get some sleep.

126
00:06:26,234 --> 00:06:29,510
- I really don't feel like seeing her.
- You know, I faked it.

127
00:06:36,234 --> 00:06:38,065
- What?
- Yeah.

128
00:06:38,234 --> 00:06:39,667
- You faked it?
- Yeah.

129
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:41,870
- Why would you do that?
- Well, you know...

130
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:45,424
...if it's enough already,
and I just wanna get some sleep.

131
00:06:49,394 --> 00:06:51,828
Yeah, but why would you-?

132
00:06:56,754 --> 00:06:59,427
- Bad peach?
- It's terrible!

133
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:02,388
- Did you get that at Joe's?
- Of course I got it at Joe's.

134
00:07:02,554 --> 00:07:04,431
Surprising.
His fruit's usually the best.

135
00:07:04,594 --> 00:07:07,267
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna return this.

136
00:07:07,434 --> 00:07:12,110
- You're returning used fruit?
- Jerry, this peach is subpar.

137
00:07:15,074 --> 00:07:17,588
- So, what do you want me to do?
- I want restitution.

138
00:07:17,754 --> 00:07:20,507
Restitution? You want restitution?

139
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:22,790
- Why should I give you restitution?
- It's no good.

140
00:07:22,954 --> 00:07:25,673
- Once I put it out, it ends for me.
- It's still your fruit.

141
00:07:25,834 --> 00:07:28,428
- You gotta stand behind your fruit.
- I stand behind my fruit.

142
00:07:28,594 --> 00:07:30,073
- So?
- Hey, you got a bad peach...

143
00:07:30,234 --> 00:07:33,590
...that's an act of God. He makes
the peaches. I sell the peaches.

144
00:07:33,754 --> 00:07:35,233
You got a problem, you talk to him.

145
00:07:35,394 --> 00:07:37,749
You know, this whole place
is going... downhill.

146
00:07:37,914 --> 00:07:40,872
I could've come in here last week
with a bad plum, but I let it go.

147
00:07:41,034 --> 00:07:43,753
Take your business elsewhere.
I don't want your business.

148
00:07:43,914 --> 00:07:45,666
- Now you don't want my business?
- I don't.

149
00:07:45,834 --> 00:07:49,224
And at this moment, you're banned
from this store. You're banned!

150
00:07:49,394 --> 00:07:51,271
But what am I gonna do for fruit?

151
00:08:13,954 --> 00:08:16,787
You seem like you really enjoyed
your risotto.

152
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,633
You have a very contented air
over there.

153
00:08:20,794 --> 00:08:23,513
You look very contented,
very satisfied.

154
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,632
- Are you satisfied?
- I'm very satisfied.

155
00:08:27,794 --> 00:08:31,753
I'm sure if you weren't satisfied, you
would say something, wouldn't you?

156
00:08:31,914 --> 00:08:34,189
- I probably would.
- Sure.

157
00:08:34,354 --> 00:08:36,424
But then again, I'm an enigma.

158
00:08:39,474 --> 00:08:43,353
Hey, listen, instead of the movie...

159
00:08:43,514 --> 00:08:46,392
...maybe we'll go back and...

160
00:08:46,554 --> 00:08:48,306
...you know...

161
00:08:51,754 --> 00:08:53,506
Maybe.

162
00:08:57,194 --> 00:08:59,105
So...

163
00:08:59,274 --> 00:09:02,311
...you feel okay
about that whole thing...

164
00:09:02,474 --> 00:09:03,907
...what we do in there.

165
00:09:04,074 --> 00:09:06,349
You're generally okay
with everything in there?

166
00:09:06,874 --> 00:09:08,353
Generally.

167
00:09:09,954 --> 00:09:12,752
Do you feel the way you feel
after the risotto?

168
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:17,346
Well, no. I feel full after the risotto.

169
00:09:18,394 --> 00:09:19,588
Yeah.

170
00:09:23,034 --> 00:09:24,945
Oh, God.

171
00:09:37,274 --> 00:09:38,866
Satisfied?

172
00:09:39,034 --> 00:09:42,151
Hey, you know what? You wanna go
see that new Meryl Streep movie?

173
00:09:44,434 --> 00:09:46,629
- Meryl Streep?
- You don't like her?

174
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:48,787
She's okay.

175
00:09:48,954 --> 00:09:51,422
God, I love her, Jerry.
She's so authentic.

176
00:09:51,594 --> 00:09:55,030
You believe everything is actually
happening to her. No acting there.

177
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:58,709
- Yeah. You don't want coffee, do you?
- I really admire actors, you know.

178
00:09:58,874 --> 00:10:01,672
It's just such an incredible skill
to pull that off.

179
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:03,426
Yeah, yeah. Can we get off of this?

180
00:10:04,794 --> 00:10:07,183
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

181
00:10:08,034 --> 00:10:09,945
You're not still thinking
about that, are you?

182
00:10:10,114 --> 00:10:12,469
- No, no.
- Oh, good.

183
00:10:13,954 --> 00:10:15,865
Give me another shot.

184
00:10:22,394 --> 00:10:25,192
- What?
- Another shot. I want another shot.

185
00:10:26,354 --> 00:10:27,912
- You mean...?
- Yes.

186
00:10:28,074 --> 00:10:31,032
- Oh, no. I don't think so.
- Come on.

187
00:10:31,194 --> 00:10:33,344
One shot. I could do it.
I know I could do it.

188
00:10:35,514 --> 00:10:38,824
Jerry, we're friends. We can't do that.
It would ruin our friendship.

189
00:10:38,994 --> 00:10:41,747
Oh, friendship.
Friendship, schmiendship.

190
00:10:42,234 --> 00:10:45,670
- No, that's important to me.
- We won't ruin the friendship.

191
00:10:45,834 --> 00:10:47,745
- Yes, we will.
- Elaine.

192
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:49,745
No, Jerry, it is out of the question.

193
00:10:49,914 --> 00:10:52,382
You know what sex does
to a friendship. It kills it.

194
00:10:52,554 --> 00:10:54,670
Half-hour. Give me a half-hour.

195
00:10:54,834 --> 00:10:56,187
- No.
- Okay, 15 minutes.

196
00:10:56,354 --> 00:10:58,629
I guarantee you, 15 minutes,
I can make it happen.

197
00:10:59,754 --> 00:11:01,426
No.

198
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:04,506
You're worried I'll be able to do it,
aren't you?

199
00:11:05,074 --> 00:11:07,986
No, it doesn't matter.
Jerry, I don't care.

200
00:11:08,154 --> 00:11:10,714
No, that's it. That's it.
You like having this over me.

201
00:11:10,874 --> 00:11:13,991
- You don't want me to do it.
- That is so ridiculous.

202
00:11:14,154 --> 00:11:15,553
- Come on, Elaine!
- No.

203
00:11:15,714 --> 00:11:17,989
- Elaine.
- No!

204
00:11:41,274 --> 00:11:43,105
- It's Jerry's fault.
- Jerry?

205
00:11:43,274 --> 00:11:46,664
Jerry and Elaine.
They made me nuts.

206
00:11:46,834 --> 00:11:51,112
Oh, I don't care, George.
Really, it's all right.

207
00:11:51,274 --> 00:11:53,026
So you feel okay?

208
00:11:53,194 --> 00:11:56,982
Well, it's not like after the risotto.

209
00:12:01,194 --> 00:12:02,786
Well, good night.

210
00:12:03,194 --> 00:12:06,664
I still don't understand why we
had to walk out on that movie.

211
00:12:06,834 --> 00:12:09,871
Oh, that Meryl Streep,
she's such a phoney baloney.

212
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:13,107
Good night.
Thanks for a really fabulous evening.

213
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:16,584
- Oh, what, you're upset?
- Yes, I'm upset. Can't you tell?

214
00:12:16,754 --> 00:12:18,551
No, I can't. Maybe you're faking.

215
00:12:20,354 --> 00:12:22,993
I'm really, really sorry
I told you that.

216
00:12:23,154 --> 00:12:25,509
- I'm sorry too.
- Well, stop being such a baby.

217
00:12:25,674 --> 00:12:28,586
- You're a baby!
- You're a baby!

218
00:12:34,794 --> 00:12:36,227
It's all your fault.

219
00:12:36,394 --> 00:12:38,589
You and Elaine, all that orgasm talk.

220
00:12:38,754 --> 00:12:42,144
She did have an orgasm, she didn't.
Orgasm this, orgasm that.

221
00:12:42,314 --> 00:12:43,793
I got so focused on it.

222
00:12:43,954 --> 00:12:47,071
I started to panic and... I lost it.

223
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:49,270
I tried everything.
I was talking to him.

224
00:12:49,434 --> 00:12:51,504
"Please wake up. Do something."

225
00:12:51,994 --> 00:12:54,383
They're mysterious little fellows,
aren't they?

226
00:12:54,554 --> 00:12:56,272
I hate him.

227
00:12:56,874 --> 00:13:00,310
You know, it happens to everybody.
Happened to Houdini.

228
00:13:00,474 --> 00:13:03,034
And he could get out of a trunk
with his hands in chains.

229
00:13:03,194 --> 00:13:05,230
But he had a problem with that.

230
00:13:05,394 --> 00:13:08,750
- The miracle is that it ever happens.
- It's like a magic trick.

231
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:11,667
Sometimes I think it would be easier
to bend a spoon mentally...

232
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:13,825
...than to make that transformation.

233
00:13:15,514 --> 00:13:17,027
- Hey.
- Hey.

234
00:13:17,194 --> 00:13:18,547
Listen...

235
00:13:19,394 --> 00:13:22,545
...if I give you money, will you
go out and get me some fruit?

236
00:13:27,074 --> 00:13:29,588
- Why can't you get it?
- Well, I got banned from the store.

237
00:13:29,754 --> 00:13:31,312
I can't go back in there now.

238
00:13:31,594 --> 00:13:35,189
- What happened?
- We had a fight over the peach...

239
00:13:35,354 --> 00:13:36,867
...and Joe doesn't want
my business.

240
00:13:37,034 --> 00:13:40,151
- Hey, is that a joke about Houdini?
- No.

241
00:13:40,634 --> 00:13:43,944
- I told you not to say anything.
- What am I gonna do for fruit?

242
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:46,867
- You'll have to go to the supermarket.
- The supermarket?

243
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:50,071
Impossible. They don't have a decent
piece of fruit at the supermarket.

244
00:13:50,234 --> 00:13:52,111
The apples are mealy.
The oranges are dry.

245
00:13:52,274 --> 00:13:54,469
I don't know what's going on
with the papayas.

246
00:13:56,514 --> 00:13:58,869
You gotta go to Joe's.
You gotta get me some fruit.

247
00:13:59,034 --> 00:14:01,104
So, what, am I gonna buy
all your fruit now?

248
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:05,108
Well, if Houdini couldn't do it,
what chance do I have?

249
00:14:11,594 --> 00:14:14,062
Hello? Oh, hi, Patty.
Thanks for calling me back.

250
00:14:14,234 --> 00:14:16,464
I wanted to ask a question.
When we were going out...

251
00:14:16,634 --> 00:14:18,545
...did you have orgasms?

252
00:14:18,914 --> 00:14:21,269
Okay. Thanks. No, that's it.

253
00:14:21,434 --> 00:14:24,904
Yeah. Okay, bye.
Patty Lawrence had them.

254
00:14:25,074 --> 00:14:28,225
- I'll make you a fruit list, all right?
- Yeah.

255
00:14:28,794 --> 00:14:30,625
Hello, Elaine?
Patty Lawrence had orgasms.

256
00:14:30,794 --> 00:14:32,227
What do you think about that?

257
00:14:32,394 --> 00:14:35,511
And I got calls in to six other women.
I bet they confirm an orgasm too.

258
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:37,426
So, what do you have
to say now, Elaine?

259
00:14:38,074 --> 00:14:39,473
Hello?

260
00:14:43,394 --> 00:14:46,545
- I feel like I'm doing something wrong.
- All right, now here's the list.

261
00:14:46,714 --> 00:14:48,466
All this? It's too much.

262
00:14:48,634 --> 00:14:50,864
- What do you need five mangoes for?
- I like mangoes.

263
00:14:51,434 --> 00:14:53,584
Avocado? I don't know how
to pick out an avocado.

264
00:14:53,754 --> 00:14:55,506
- Well, they gotta be soft.
- How soft?

265
00:14:55,674 --> 00:14:57,107
But not too soft.

266
00:14:57,274 --> 00:14:59,993
See, better too hard
than too soft.

267
00:15:00,154 --> 00:15:03,032
I'm not going through this
every week. I'll you that right now.

268
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:05,105
What are these, plums?
What is that?

269
00:15:05,274 --> 00:15:07,583
Yeah. Now, get the ones
that are red on the inside.

270
00:15:07,754 --> 00:15:09,585
How do I know
what they look like inside?

271
00:15:09,754 --> 00:15:11,426
What do they look like
on the outside?

272
00:15:11,594 --> 00:15:14,154
- Oh, and get some plantains.
- Plantains?

273
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:15,508
- Yes.
- What's a plantain?

274
00:15:15,674 --> 00:15:17,505
It's in the banana family.
It's a delicacy.

275
00:15:17,674 --> 00:15:19,187
You're not getting any plantains.

276
00:15:26,674 --> 00:15:29,268
- Hey, Joe.
- How's it going?

277
00:15:29,634 --> 00:15:32,944
Good. Just getting some fruit
for myself.

278
00:15:34,874 --> 00:15:36,944
Gotta have fruit in the house.

279
00:15:37,114 --> 00:15:39,674
I like it as a snack. Wholesome...

280
00:15:39,834 --> 00:15:41,984
...natural, chock-full of vitamins.

281
00:15:43,194 --> 00:15:45,424
All right, let's see...

282
00:15:45,594 --> 00:15:47,664
Mangoes.

283
00:15:48,474 --> 00:15:51,830
Four plums with red on the inside.

284
00:15:54,394 --> 00:15:56,749
An avocado.

285
00:15:57,594 --> 00:15:58,947
Just right.

286
00:16:00,634 --> 00:16:05,424
And three plantains ought to do it.

287
00:16:05,794 --> 00:16:08,433
- All right, just hold it right there.
- What?

288
00:16:08,594 --> 00:16:10,312
This fruit isn't for you.

289
00:16:12,354 --> 00:16:15,073
- What are you talking about?
- You think I don't know, huh?

290
00:16:15,234 --> 00:16:19,022
Mangoes, plantains, plums with
the red on the inside? That's Kramer.

291
00:16:19,674 --> 00:16:23,144
- I can't buy mangoes and plantains?
- All right, get out.

292
00:16:23,834 --> 00:16:27,463
- You're making a big mistake, Joe.
- I don't want your business either.

293
00:16:27,634 --> 00:16:31,024
- Are you banning me from the store?
- That's exactly what I'm saying.

294
00:16:31,194 --> 00:16:33,424
- I'm banned?
- You're banned.

295
00:16:38,194 --> 00:16:40,424
- All right, where do you want it?
- Put it over there.

296
00:16:40,594 --> 00:16:41,993
Yes.

297
00:16:43,154 --> 00:16:44,951
- This stuff is heavy.
- Oh, great.

298
00:16:45,114 --> 00:16:48,629
What do you got? Look at these.
These mangoes are beautiful.

299
00:16:48,794 --> 00:16:50,546
Oh, those are beautiful.
You did good.

300
00:16:50,714 --> 00:16:52,670
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

301
00:16:52,834 --> 00:16:55,587
- All right, I gotta get going.
- What are you doing?

302
00:16:55,754 --> 00:16:57,585
I got a date with Karen.

303
00:16:57,754 --> 00:16:59,710
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

304
00:16:59,874 --> 00:17:02,547
There's nothing happening
down there.

305
00:17:02,714 --> 00:17:05,433
You're thinking about too much,
putting too much emphasis on it.

306
00:17:05,594 --> 00:17:08,347
I knew this was gonna happen
someday. It was inevitable.

307
00:17:08,514 --> 00:17:11,631
I've known it ever since I was
a little kid. I've been waiting for it.

308
00:17:13,034 --> 00:17:14,467
This mango is delicious.

309
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:17,194
That reminds me. I'm not getting
you guys any more fruit.

310
00:17:17,354 --> 00:17:20,426
That guy was eyeballing me
the whole time. Gave me the creeps.

311
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:23,348
All right, you owe me 28.60.

312
00:17:23,514 --> 00:17:25,789
Gee, sorry, I don't have any cash.

313
00:17:26,074 --> 00:17:28,304
I only got hundreds.

314
00:17:30,074 --> 00:17:31,302
You see, I- I knew it.

315
00:17:31,474 --> 00:17:33,544
Come on, we're gonna pay you.
Have some mango.

316
00:17:33,714 --> 00:17:37,150
- I don't want any mango.
- Come on, take some. It's good.

317
00:17:37,554 --> 00:17:38,828
Yeah.

318
00:17:39,474 --> 00:17:41,146
It's very good.

319
00:17:41,314 --> 00:17:43,669
Juicy. Ripe.

320
00:17:44,234 --> 00:17:47,146
Boy, this Joe's got
some terrific fruit.

321
00:17:48,354 --> 00:17:49,946
What?

322
00:17:50,114 --> 00:17:52,469
I feel like I got a B12 shot.

323
00:17:52,634 --> 00:17:54,829
- This is like a taste explosion.
- I told you.

324
00:17:56,754 --> 00:17:58,346
What is it?

325
00:17:59,674 --> 00:18:01,505
I think it moved.

326
00:18:02,394 --> 00:18:04,862
Oh, my God. I think it moved.
Here, give me the big piece.

327
00:18:05,914 --> 00:18:07,745
- I'll see you later.
- Hey, George.

328
00:18:07,914 --> 00:18:10,633
I'm back, baby! I'm back!

329
00:18:12,114 --> 00:18:15,345
- Do you want some mango?
- No, thanks.

330
00:18:16,514 --> 00:18:19,904
Well, well. If it isn't the first lady
of the American theatre.

331
00:18:22,754 --> 00:18:24,153
What brings you here?

332
00:18:24,314 --> 00:18:27,351
Just gonna return some of your things
that were in my house.

333
00:18:27,834 --> 00:18:29,870
And I've got some things
of yours here.

334
00:18:30,034 --> 00:18:31,513
- I know.
- Well, I'll get them.

335
00:18:31,674 --> 00:18:33,949
- I'm waiting.
- All right then.

336
00:18:34,834 --> 00:18:36,745
- You got my fins?
- Yeah, I got your fins.

337
00:18:36,914 --> 00:18:39,144
- Do you have my poker chips?
- I got your poker chips.

338
00:18:39,314 --> 00:18:41,544
- You got my goggles?
- They're next to the fins.

339
00:18:41,714 --> 00:18:45,024
- You got my cards?
- They're next to the poker chips.

340
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:49,873
All right.

341
00:18:50,914 --> 00:18:54,589
- Guess that just about does it.
- I guess.

342
00:18:55,674 --> 00:18:59,508
- Okay, well, see you around.
- Yeah, see you.

343
00:19:03,554 --> 00:19:05,863
All right, let's go.
I'll give you half an hour.

344
00:19:09,194 --> 00:19:11,150
- What?
- Come on.

345
00:19:11,314 --> 00:19:13,066
- Are you serious?
- Look, Jerry...

346
00:19:13,234 --> 00:19:15,828
...we have to have sex
to save the friendship.

347
00:19:17,434 --> 00:19:20,312
Sex to save the friendship.

348
00:19:23,234 --> 00:19:27,068
Well, if we have to, we have to.

349
00:19:31,474 --> 00:19:33,624
Oh, George.

350
00:19:36,034 --> 00:19:38,753
Please, it's not necessary.

351
00:19:38,914 --> 00:19:41,030
What's not necessary?

352
00:19:41,194 --> 00:19:43,992
The little extra moan
you threw in there.

353
00:19:44,154 --> 00:19:46,714
Laying it on a bit thick,
don't you think?

354
00:19:46,874 --> 00:19:50,264
- What are you talking about?
- What am I talking about? Come on.

355
00:19:50,434 --> 00:19:52,106
You don't think I bought all that.

356
00:19:52,834 --> 00:19:55,985
- Bought what?
- No, you're very good.

357
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:58,588
Very good with the moanings
and the gyrations.

358
00:19:58,754 --> 00:20:01,029
You really had me going there
for a minute.

359
00:20:01,554 --> 00:20:03,465
You think I was faking?

360
00:20:04,114 --> 00:20:07,663
Come on. With the,
"Oh, George. Oh, George!"

361
00:20:07,834 --> 00:20:09,347
Come on.

362
00:20:09,514 --> 00:20:12,631
Not that I don't appreciate the effort
that was put into the performance.

363
00:20:15,354 --> 00:20:17,265
I'd like you to leave.

364
00:20:17,794 --> 00:20:20,627
- What?
- I said, I would like you to leave.

365
00:20:20,794 --> 00:20:23,672
- Just get your clothes on and get out.
- But why?

366
00:20:23,834 --> 00:20:26,348
Because I said so!

367
00:20:27,194 --> 00:20:29,071
- I can't find my glasses.
- Well, hurry up.

368
00:20:29,234 --> 00:20:32,226
- Let me look for my glasses.
- Get out.

369
00:20:32,754 --> 00:20:35,029
Get out.

370
00:20:35,554 --> 00:20:36,873
Get out.

371
00:20:50,114 --> 00:20:51,547
It's all George's fault.

372
00:20:51,714 --> 00:20:54,433
All that talk about impotence,
it got to me.

373
00:20:54,594 --> 00:20:57,108
And that orgasm stuff.
Orgasm this and orgasm that.

374
00:20:57,274 --> 00:20:59,026
It's a lot of pressure.

375
00:20:59,194 --> 00:21:00,343
I'm a little hungry.

376
00:21:00,514 --> 00:21:02,709
You wouldn't happen to have
any of that mango left?

377
00:21:12,874 --> 00:21:15,672
The female orgasm,
it's kind of like the Batcave.

378
00:21:15,834 --> 00:21:17,392
Very few people know where it is.

379
00:21:17,554 --> 00:21:19,272
And if you're lucky enough
to see it...

380
00:21:19,434 --> 00:21:21,470
...you probably don't know
how you got there...

381
00:21:21,634 --> 00:21:23,989
...and you can't find your way back
after you leave.

382
00:21:25,834 --> 00:21:29,986
There are two types of female
orgasm, the real and the fake.

383
00:21:30,154 --> 00:21:33,908
And I'll tell you right now,
as a man, we don't know.

384
00:21:34,074 --> 00:21:36,827
We do not know. Because to men,
sex is like a car accident...

385
00:21:36,994 --> 00:21:39,554
...and determining the female orgasm
is like being asked:

386
00:21:39,714 --> 00:21:42,547
"What did you see after the car
went out of control?"

387
00:21:42,714 --> 00:21:45,274
"I heard a lot of screeching sounds.

388
00:21:45,434 --> 00:21:48,471
I remember I was facing
the wrong way at one point.

389
00:21:48,634 --> 00:21:51,273
And in the end,
my body was thrown clear."

390
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:00,224
