1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:04,603
<i>There's no way
that moving in with your parents...</i>

2
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:08,769
<i>...is a sign that your life
is right on track.</i>

3
00:00:08,929 --> 00:00:11,079
<i>There's no way
that you could fake this even.</i>

4
00:00:11,249 --> 00:00:13,922
<i>"Things are great.
I met a terrific girl, I got a great job...</i>

5
00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:16,364
<i>...and if everything goes
according to plan...</i>

6
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:19,919
<i>...I'm gonna be moving back in
with my parents soon."</i>

7
00:00:21,169 --> 00:00:23,239
<i>It's like getting busted
on a parole violation...</i>

8
00:00:23,409 --> 00:00:25,161
<i>...and thrown back
into the slammer.</i>

9
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:29,004
<i>"In the opinion of the board, you
need further rehabilitation, I'm afraid."</i>

10
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:33,000
<i>And you go back into that little room
of yours, you feel so huge.</i>

11
00:00:33,169 --> 00:00:36,047
<i>It's like you could take your bed
and just crush it in your hands.</i>

12
00:00:36,209 --> 00:00:38,279
<i>You can hold your parents
between your fingers.</i>

13
00:00:38,449 --> 00:00:40,917
<i>"Why was I so afraid of you people
when I was growing up?"</i>

14
00:00:45,769 --> 00:00:48,408
<i>- I can't believe this.
- It won't be for that long.</i>

15
00:00:48,569 --> 00:00:51,288
<i>How can I do this? How can I
move back in with those people?</i>

16
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:53,565
<i>Please, tell me.
They're insane, you know that.</i>

17
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:55,799
<i>Hey, my parents are
as crazy as your parents.</i>

18
00:00:55,969 --> 00:00:57,800
<i>How can you compare
your parents to mine?</i>

19
00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:01,882
<i>My father has never
thrown anything out ever.</i>

20
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:07,406
<i>My father wears his sneakers
in the pool. Sneakers.</i>

21
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:11,323
<i>My mother has never set foot
in a natural body of water.</i>

22
00:01:14,129 --> 00:01:16,040
<i>Listen carefully.</i>

23
00:01:17,169 --> 00:01:19,319
<i>My mother has never laughed.</i>

24
00:01:19,489 --> 00:01:24,517
<i>Ever. Not a giggle,
not a chuckle, not a tee-hee.</i>

25
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:27,157
<i>Never went, "Ha."</i>

26
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:29,399
<i>- A smirk?
- Maybe.</i>

27
00:01:29,569 --> 00:01:32,641
<i>- And I'm moving back in there.
- I'll lend you the money for the rent.</i>

28
00:01:32,809 --> 00:01:35,721
<i>No, no, no. Borrowing money
from a friend is like having sex.</i>

29
00:01:35,889 --> 00:01:37,800
<i>It just completely changes
the relationship.</i>

30
00:01:39,889 --> 00:01:41,641
<i>- Hey.
- Hey.</i>

31
00:01:41,809 --> 00:01:43,162
<i>All right, I'm ready.</i>

32
00:01:43,329 --> 00:01:46,844
<i>I still don't understand. Why do you
want to move back with your parents?</i>

33
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:51,048
<i>I don't want to. I'm out of money.
I got $714 in the bank.</i>

34
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:54,087
<i>- Well, move in here.
- What's that?</i>

35
00:01:54,929 --> 00:01:56,601
<i>Why doesn't he just move in here?</i>

36
00:01:56,769 --> 00:01:59,647
<i>Yeah, I'll move in with him.
He doesn't let you use the toilet.</i>

37
00:01:59,809 --> 00:02:02,039
<i>You can move in with me
if you want.</i>

38
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:06,441
<i>Thank you. I...</i>

39
00:02:06,609 --> 00:02:08,725
That might not work out.

40
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:15,120
<i>Careful. Careful with the suitcases.
We just painted.</i>

41
00:02:15,289 --> 00:02:17,325
<i>- Hello, Mrs. Costanza.
- Hello, Kramer.</i>

42
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:19,400
<i>- Close the door.
- I gotta bring in more stuff.</i>

43
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:22,561
<i>- More stuff? How much is there?
- There's more.</i>

44
00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:26,278
<i>- So how are you, Jerry?
- Fine, Mrs. Costanza.</i>

45
00:02:26,449 --> 00:02:30,283
<i>- Hey, I got a terrific joke for you.
- I'm not interested.</i>

46
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:33,521
<i>No, no. It's really funny.</i>

47
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:36,522
<i>- There's these two guy-
- Tell it to the audience.</i>

48
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:39,880
<i>Here, I made some
bologna sandwiches.</i>

49
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:42,005
<i>Bologna? Nobody eats
bologna anymore.</i>

50
00:02:42,169 --> 00:02:44,524
<i>What are you talking about?
Have a sandwich.</i>

51
00:02:44,689 --> 00:02:46,919
- No, thanks.
- Oh, stop it.

52
00:02:47,089 --> 00:02:49,808
<i>- You don't want one, Kramer?
- No, thanks.</i>

53
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:52,199
<i>I think you're all
a little touched in the head.</i>

54
00:02:52,369 --> 00:02:55,167
<i>You're so worried about your health?
You're young men.</i>

55
00:02:55,329 --> 00:02:58,685
<i>- I really don't eat it.
- What will I do with these sandwiches?</i>

56
00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:01,807
<i>Will you take them home, give them
to someone in your building?</i>

57
00:03:03,369 --> 00:03:07,408
<i>I don't feel comfortable handing out
bologna sandwiches in the building.</i>

58
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:11,084
<i>- All right. That's it. Anything else?
- No, that's it.</i>

59
00:03:12,809 --> 00:03:15,846
<i>- I gotta go move the car.
- Well, I guess we'll be going.</i>

60
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:18,764
<i>- What, you're going?
- Yeah.</i>

61
00:03:21,009 --> 00:03:23,159
<i>Well, what are you doing later?</i>

62
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:25,638
<i>Elaine and I are having dinner
with Kramer and his new girlfriend.</i>

63
00:03:25,809 --> 00:03:27,720
<i>- Really?
- Yeah. You can't believe this woman.</i>

64
00:03:27,889 --> 00:03:30,403
<i>She's one of these low-talkers.
You can't hear a word.</i>

65
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:33,129
<i>You're always going,
"Excuse me? What was that?"</i>

66
00:03:33,289 --> 00:03:35,200
<i>- Maybe I'll meet you.
- No, George.</i>

67
00:03:35,369 --> 00:03:38,520
<i>We're going out to eat tonight
with your father.</i>

68
00:03:40,689 --> 00:03:41,963
Okay.

69
00:03:43,649 --> 00:03:46,368
<i>- I'll talk to you later.
- Yeah, take it easy.</i>

70
00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:58,445
Oh, my God.

71
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:05,487
<i>- Yeah?
- I had this idea for a pizza place...</i>

72
00:04:05,649 --> 00:04:08,209
<i>- ... where you make your own pie.
- Right.</i>

73
00:04:08,369 --> 00:04:09,927
<i>- You remember?
- That was a good one.</i>

74
00:04:10,089 --> 00:04:11,568
<i>Well...</i>

75
00:04:15,369 --> 00:04:16,518
<i>- What's that?
- Excuse me?</i>

76
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:24,039
<i>- Yeah? Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah.</i>

77
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:29,243
<i>You know that Leslie's
in the clothing business?</i>

78
00:04:29,409 --> 00:04:30,603
<i>She's a designer.</i>

79
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:34,318
<i>She's come up with a new one that'll
be the big new look in men's fashions.</i>

80
00:04:34,489 --> 00:04:37,049
<i>It's, like, a puffy shirt.</i>

81
00:04:37,209 --> 00:04:39,769
<i>Well, yeah, it's all puffy.</i>

82
00:04:39,929 --> 00:04:41,248
<i>Like the pirates used to wear.</i>

83
00:04:42,289 --> 00:04:44,086
- Oh, a puffy shirt.
- Puffy.

84
00:04:44,249 --> 00:04:47,878
<i>Yeah. See, I think people
wanna look like pirates.</i>

85
00:04:48,049 --> 00:04:49,323
<i>It's the right time for it.</i>

86
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:53,164
<i>To be all puffy
and devil-may-care, you know.</i>

87
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:56,163
<i>Yeah.</i>

88
00:04:58,849 --> 00:05:01,079
<i>That's true.</i>

89
00:05:03,409 --> 00:05:06,128
<i>I'll be right back.</i>

90
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:17,005
<i>Jerry's gonna be
on the Today show on Friday.</i>

91
00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:20,684
<i>- Yeah, that's right.
- Yep. He's promoting...</i>

92
00:05:20,849 --> 00:05:22,282
<i>...a benefit for Goodwill.</i>

93
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:25,725
<i>You know, they clothe the poor
and the homeless.</i>

94
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:27,686
<i>- And the indigent.
- And the indigent, yeah.</i>

95
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:31,967
<i>I do volunteer work for them. I set the
whole thing up and got Jerry to do it.</i>

96
00:05:37,329 --> 00:05:38,967
<i>- Sure. Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.</i>

97
00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:40,767
<i>Yeah. Yep.</i>

98
00:05:44,809 --> 00:05:46,242
<i>Yep.</i>

99
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:48,804
<i>Yep, yep.</i>

100
00:05:50,929 --> 00:05:52,999
<i>Maybe you should take
a civil-service test.</i>

101
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:57,242
<i>- I'm not taking a civil-service test.
- Look at this, George.</i>

102
00:05:57,409 --> 00:05:58,888
<i>You ever seen a silver dollar?</i>

103
00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:01,487
<i>Yes, I've seen a silver dollar.</i>

104
00:06:01,649 --> 00:06:03,560
<i>Why don't you wanna take
a civil-service test?</i>

105
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:06,721
<i>To do what? Work in the post office?
Is that what you want me to do?</i>

106
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:12,122
<i>Would you believe when I was 18
I had a silver-dollar collection?</i>

107
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,883
<i>I don't understand.
You get job security.</i>

108
00:06:16,049 --> 00:06:19,086
<i>- You get a paycheck every week.
- I'm a college graduate.</i>

109
00:06:19,249 --> 00:06:20,602
<i>You want me to be a mailman?</i>

110
00:06:20,769 --> 00:06:23,841
<i>You know, I couldn't bring myself
to spend one of these.</i>

111
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:26,318
<i>I got some kind of a...</i>

112
00:06:26,489 --> 00:06:27,842
...phobia.

113
00:06:30,769 --> 00:06:33,158
<i>- So, what are you gonna do?
- I don't know.</i>

114
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:36,526
<i>I do know that I have some kind
of a talent, something to offer.</i>

115
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:38,361
<i>I just don't know what it is yet.</i>

116
00:06:38,529 --> 00:06:43,649
<i>I bet that collection would be worth
a lot of money today.</i>

117
00:06:47,729 --> 00:06:49,799
Oh, my God.

118
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:54,285
<i>I don't like this waiter.</i>

119
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:57,161
Look at him.

120
00:06:57,489 --> 00:06:59,525
<i>He sees us.</i>

121
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:01,805
<i>Doesn't wanna come over.</i>

122
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,159
<i>I need some air.</i>

123
00:07:05,649 --> 00:07:09,642
<i>- George, where you going?
- I got a lot of thinking to do.</i>

124
00:07:13,049 --> 00:07:15,085
<i>Oh, I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry.</i>

125
00:07:15,249 --> 00:07:17,365
<i>Look what you've done.
You've spilled my bag.</i>

126
00:07:17,529 --> 00:07:19,645
<i>- Here, let me help you.
- No, no. It's all right.</i>

127
00:07:19,809 --> 00:07:22,198
<i>It's just that I'm here
with my parents...</i>

128
00:07:22,369 --> 00:07:24,803
<i>...and my mother wants me to take
a civil-service test...</i>

129
00:07:24,969 --> 00:07:27,881
<i>...and to tell you the truth,
I don't even think I'd pass it.</i>

130
00:07:28,969 --> 00:07:30,448
What?

131
00:07:32,929 --> 00:07:35,568
<i>- Your hands.
- What about them?</i>

132
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:39,719
<i>They're quite exquisite.</i>

133
00:07:40,489 --> 00:07:42,127
<i>They are?</i>

134
00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:44,519
Extraordinary.

135
00:07:44,689 --> 00:07:46,680
<i>Have you ever done
any hand modelling?</i>

136
00:07:47,289 --> 00:07:49,325
<i>Hand modelling? No.</i>

137
00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:51,760
<i>Here's my card.</i>

138
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,487
Why don't you...

139
00:07:53,649 --> 00:07:55,560
<i>...give me a call?</i>

140
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:04,643
<i>I don't get it.</i>

141
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:07,323
<i>Me neither.</i>

142
00:08:07,489 --> 00:08:09,764
- What is it?
- I don't know.

143
00:08:09,929 --> 00:08:12,443
<i>- They're hands.
- This woman set me up for a job.</i>

144
00:08:12,609 --> 00:08:13,883
<i>Well, what about my hands?</i>

145
00:08:14,049 --> 00:08:16,688
<i>I don't see how your hands
are any better than my hands.</i>

146
00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:18,282
<i>What, are you kidding?</i>

147
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:20,724
<i>The knuckles
are all out of proportion.</i>

148
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:24,120
<i>You got hair there. Where do you
get off comparing your hands to mine?</i>

149
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:27,159
<i>This is a one-in-a-million hand.</i>

150
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:31,319
<i>That's what comes from avoiding
manual labour your whole life.</i>

151
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:36,004
<i>This is it.
It's happened to me, Jerry.</i>

152
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:39,764
<i>I was sitting in the restaurant,
the two nutjobs were talking.</i>

153
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:41,203
<i>I couldn't take it anymore.</i>

154
00:08:41,369 --> 00:08:43,803
<i>I get up from the table,
and... I bop into this woman.</i>

155
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:45,561
<i>It's just like in the movies.</i>

156
00:08:46,049 --> 00:08:47,880
<i>- Hey.
- Hey.</i>

157
00:08:48,369 --> 00:08:50,929
<i>- Hey, George.
- Hey.</i>

158
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:54,682
<i>- Are you crazy?! Are you crazy?!
- What? What?</i>

159
00:08:54,849 --> 00:08:58,888
<i>- You could've damaged my hands!
- What? It's just a toy.</i>

160
00:08:59,049 --> 00:09:00,926
<i>George has become a hand model.</i>

161
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:02,841
<i>- A hand model?
- Yes.</i>

162
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,398
<i>Really? Let me see your hands.</i>

163
00:09:05,569 --> 00:09:08,447
<i>You can look at them,
but do not touch them.</i>

164
00:09:11,169 --> 00:09:12,841
<i>Let's see.</i>

165
00:09:13,049 --> 00:09:15,404
<i>Oh, those are nice.</i>

166
00:09:15,569 --> 00:09:17,639
<i>You know,
I never noticed this before.</i>

167
00:09:17,809 --> 00:09:19,322
<i>They're smooth.</i>

168
00:09:19,489 --> 00:09:20,922
<i>Creamy.</i>

169
00:09:21,089 --> 00:09:24,126
<i>Delicate yet masculine.</i>

170
00:09:25,289 --> 00:09:27,484
<i>All right. I gotta get going.</i>

171
00:09:29,489 --> 00:09:30,683
<i>Oven mitts?</i>

172
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:35,520
It's all I could find.

173
00:09:36,369 --> 00:09:39,406
<i>- Would you mind getting the door?
- All right.</i>

174
00:09:41,329 --> 00:09:43,240
<i>- Thank you very much.
- Yep.</i>

175
00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:48,600
<i>You won't believe
what's up with Leslie.</i>

176
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:51,237
<i>Since you agreed to wear
the puffy shirt on Today...</i>

177
00:09:51,409 --> 00:09:54,879
<i>...she's getting all these orders
from boutiques and department stores.</i>

178
00:09:56,289 --> 00:09:58,041
<i>Since I what?</i>

179
00:09:58,929 --> 00:10:02,080
<i>- Agreed to wear the puffy shirt.
- What are you talking about?</i>

180
00:10:02,609 --> 00:10:06,284
<i>You said that you would agree to wear
the puffy shirt on the Today show.</i>

181
00:10:17,329 --> 00:10:19,240
<i>- This?
- Yeah.</i>

182
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:23,247
<i>- I agreed to wear this?
- Yeah, yeah.</i>

183
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,443
<i>Well, when did I do that?</i>

184
00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:27,719
<i>When we went to dinner
the other night.</i>

185
00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:29,959
<i>What, are you crazy?</i>

186
00:10:30,409 --> 00:10:32,764
<i>What were you talking about
when I went to the bathroom?</i>

187
00:10:32,929 --> 00:10:35,159
<i>I don't know.
I couldn't understand a word she said.</i>

188
00:10:35,329 --> 00:10:37,240
<i>- I was just nodding.
- There you go.</i>

189
00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:39,283
<i>Where I go?</i>

190
00:10:39,449 --> 00:10:42,088
<i>You mean she was asking me
to wear this ridiculous shirt...</i>

191
00:10:42,249 --> 00:10:45,639
<i>- ... on national TV, and I said yes?
- Yes, yes. You said it.</i>

192
00:10:45,809 --> 00:10:48,448
<i>I didn't know what she was
talking about. I couldn't hear her.</i>

193
00:10:48,609 --> 00:10:53,239
<i>- Well, she asked you.
- I can't wear this puffy shirt on TV.</i>

194
00:10:53,409 --> 00:10:55,639
<i>I mean, look at it. It looks ridiculous.</i>

195
00:10:56,129 --> 00:10:57,562
<i>Well, you gotta wear it now.</i>

196
00:10:57,729 --> 00:10:59,242
<i>All those stores are stocking it...</i>

197
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,718
<i>...based on the condition
you'll wear this on the show.</i>

198
00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:04,449
<i>The factory in New Jersey
is already making them.</i>

199
00:11:04,609 --> 00:11:06,918
<i>They're making these?</i>

200
00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:08,522
<i>Yes, yes.</i>

201
00:11:08,689 --> 00:11:10,725
<i>This pirate trend
she's come up with, Jerry...</i>

202
00:11:10,889 --> 00:11:12,686
<i>This is gonna be
the new look for the '90s.</i>

203
00:11:12,849 --> 00:11:14,601
<i>You're gonna be the first pirate.</i>

204
00:11:14,769 --> 00:11:17,124
<i>But I don't wanna be a pirate.</i>

205
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:26,047
<i>I knew it. I knew it. I always knew
you had beautiful hands.</i>

206
00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:27,403
<i>I used to tell people-</i>

207
00:11:27,569 --> 00:11:30,083
<i>Frank, didn't I use to
talk about his hands?</i>

208
00:11:30,249 --> 00:11:32,638
<i>Who the hell did you ever
mention his hands to?</i>

209
00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:34,606
<i>I mentioned his hands
to plenty of people.</i>

210
00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:36,043
<i>You never mentioned them to me.</i>

211
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:39,604
<i>Hand me an emery board.</i>

212
00:11:41,129 --> 00:11:45,645
<i>I always talk about your hands,
how they're so soft and milky white.</i>

213
00:11:45,809 --> 00:11:49,643
<i>- No, you never said milky white.
- I said milky white!</i>

214
00:11:53,569 --> 00:11:55,400
Scissor.

215
00:11:57,129 --> 00:11:59,848
<i>Don't hand them to me
with the point facing out!</i>

216
00:12:00,009 --> 00:12:01,647
<i>- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?</i>

217
00:12:01,809 --> 00:12:04,642
<i>I'll try to be more careful.</i>

218
00:12:05,249 --> 00:12:07,479
<i>I hope so.</i>

219
00:12:11,009 --> 00:12:12,761
<i>Georgie-</i>

220
00:12:14,409 --> 00:12:17,321
<i>Georgie, would you like
some Jell-O?</i>

221
00:12:17,489 --> 00:12:19,798
<i>Why'd you put
the bananas in there?</i>

222
00:12:19,969 --> 00:12:23,359
<i>- George likes the bananas!
- So let him have bananas on the side!</i>

223
00:12:23,529 --> 00:12:27,920
<i>All right, please. Please,
I cannot have this constant bickering.</i>

224
00:12:28,929 --> 00:12:32,365
<i>Stress is very damaging
to the epidermis.</i>

225
00:12:33,729 --> 00:12:35,765
<i>I have an important
photo session in the morning.</i>

226
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:37,965
<i>My hands have got to be
in tiptop shape.</i>

227
00:12:38,129 --> 00:12:41,485
<i>So, please, keep the television down
and the conversation to a minimum.</i>

228
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:45,598
<i>But, Georgie,
what about the Jell-O?</i>

229
00:12:46,609 --> 00:12:47,803
<i>I'll take it in my room.</i>

230
00:12:53,529 --> 00:12:55,326
<i>Yeah, come in.</i>

231
00:12:55,489 --> 00:12:57,400
<i>Wanted to let you know
he's got five minutes.</i>

232
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:59,241
<i>Yep, yep.</i>

233
00:13:01,009 --> 00:13:03,398
<i>Jerry, five minutes.</i>

234
00:13:11,569 --> 00:13:14,129
<i>Now, that's a great-looking shirt.</i>

235
00:13:14,289 --> 00:13:17,326
<i>Aye, captain. Yeah.</i>

236
00:13:17,489 --> 00:13:19,957
<i>See, I'm glad I ironed it. It's perfect.</i>

237
00:13:20,129 --> 00:13:22,927
Look at it. It's fantastic.

238
00:13:23,089 --> 00:13:25,728
<i>Kramer, how am I gonna wear this?
I can't wear this.</i>

239
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:28,528
<i>Hey, this looks better
than anything you own.</i>

240
00:13:28,689 --> 00:13:33,080
<i>In two months' time, everybody's
gonna be wearing the pirate look.</i>

241
00:13:36,209 --> 00:13:38,677
<i>- Yeah.
- Hi, Kramer. I just saw Bryant Gumbel.</i>

242
00:13:38,849 --> 00:13:41,647
<i>- He said he might help at the benefit.
- Great.</i>

243
00:13:48,889 --> 00:13:52,245
<i>- What is that?
- It's the puffy shirt. Look at it, huh?</i>

244
00:13:52,409 --> 00:13:54,286
What do you think?
Is it cool or what?

245
00:13:55,529 --> 00:13:58,566
<i>- Why are you wearing this now?
- Why am I wearing it now?</i>

246
00:13:58,729 --> 00:14:00,799
<i>I'll tell you why I'm wearing it now.</i>

247
00:14:00,969 --> 00:14:03,403
<i>Because the low-talker
asked me to, that's why.</i>

248
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:08,048
<i>And I said yes. Do you know why?
Because I couldn't hear her.</i>

249
00:14:09,489 --> 00:14:11,719
<i>When did she-?
When did she ask you this?</i>

250
00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:13,880
<i>At dinner,
when Kramer went to the bathroom.</i>

251
00:14:14,049 --> 00:14:15,960
<i>- I didn't hear anything.
- Of course not!</i>

252
00:14:16,129 --> 00:14:18,689
<i>Nobody hears anything
when this woman speaks.</i>

253
00:14:19,769 --> 00:14:21,407
<i>Well, you can't wear that
on the show.</i>

254
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,082
<i>- Elaine, you wanna stop it?
- What-?</i>

255
00:14:24,009 --> 00:14:26,398
<i>What? No, Jerry,
you are promoting a benefit...</i>

256
00:14:26,569 --> 00:14:30,528
<i>...to clothe homeless people.</i>

257
00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:34,603
<i>You can't come out
dressed like that.</i>

258
00:14:34,769 --> 00:14:36,885
<i>You're all puffed up.</i>

259
00:14:37,729 --> 00:14:39,959
<i>You look like
the Count of Monte Cristo.</i>

260
00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:42,763
<i>I have to wear it.
The woman has orders for this shirt...</i>

261
00:14:42,929 --> 00:14:44,840
<i>- ... based on me wearing it on TV.
- Yeah.</i>

262
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,681
<i>They're producing them
as we speak.</i>

263
00:14:46,849 --> 00:14:49,727
<i>Yeah, but you're supposed to be
a compassionate person...</i>

264
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,641
<i>...that cares about poor people.</i>

265
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:54,846
<i>You look like you're gonna swing in
on a chandelier.</i>

266
00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:01,519
<i>Okay, let's go.</i>

267
00:15:02,129 --> 00:15:04,040
<i>Is that what you're wearing?</i>

268
00:15:06,409 --> 00:15:08,525
<i>I've never seen
hands like these before.</i>

269
00:15:08,689 --> 00:15:11,078
<i>They're so soft and milky white.</i>

270
00:15:11,249 --> 00:15:13,638
<i>You know whose hands
they remind me of?</i>

271
00:15:13,809 --> 00:15:16,960
<i>Ray McKigney.</i>

272
00:15:17,129 --> 00:15:18,847
<i>- Ray.
- He was it.</i>

273
00:15:19,409 --> 00:15:20,558
<i>Who was he?</i>

274
00:15:20,729 --> 00:15:22,720
<i>The most exquisite hands
you've ever seen.</i>

275
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:24,208
<i>Oh, he had it all.</i>

276
00:15:24,849 --> 00:15:26,202
<i>What happened to him?</i>

277
00:15:30,689 --> 00:15:34,125
Tragic story, I'm afraid.

278
00:15:34,289 --> 00:15:36,803
<i>He could've had
any woman in the world...</i>

279
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:40,518
<i>...but none could match the beauty
of his own hand.</i>

280
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:44,238
<i>And that became his one true love.</i>

281
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:51,847
<i>- You mean...
- Yes.</i>

282
00:15:52,009 --> 00:15:55,922
<i>He was not master of his domain.</i>

283
00:15:59,449 --> 00:16:01,360
<i>- But how...?
- The muscles...</i>

284
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:04,043
<i>...became so strained
with overuse...</i>

285
00:16:04,209 --> 00:16:07,246
<i>...that eventually the hand locked
into a deformed position...</i>

286
00:16:07,409 --> 00:16:09,286
<i>...and he was left
with nothing but a claw.</i>

287
00:16:11,089 --> 00:16:13,557
<i>He travelled the world
seeking a cure.</i>

288
00:16:13,729 --> 00:16:17,642
<i>Acupuncturists, herbalists, swamis.</i>

289
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:19,083
<i>Nothing helped.</i>

290
00:16:20,209 --> 00:16:23,326
<i>Towards the end,
his hands became so frozen...</i>

291
00:16:23,489 --> 00:16:25,320
<i>...he was unable
to manipulate utensils...</i>

292
00:16:25,489 --> 00:16:29,562
<i>...and was dependent
on Cub Scouts to feed him.</i>

293
00:16:29,849 --> 00:16:34,127
<i>I hadn't seen another pair of hands
like Ray McKigney's until today.</i>

294
00:16:34,289 --> 00:16:36,359
<i>You are his successor.</i>

295
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:40,363
<i>I only hope you have
a little more self-control.</i>

296
00:16:44,569 --> 00:16:46,958
<i>You don't have to worry about me.</i>

297
00:16:47,369 --> 00:16:49,599
<i>I won a contest.</i>

298
00:16:55,249 --> 00:16:57,968
<i>Okay, let's get to work.</i>

299
00:17:01,209 --> 00:17:04,519
<i>Back now, 7:46. On Tuesday
the 19th, here in New York...</i>

300
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:06,839
<i>...there'll be a benefit
for Goodwill Industries...</i>

301
00:17:07,009 --> 00:17:10,001
<i>...a used-clothing organization
that provides services to the needy.</i>

302
00:17:10,169 --> 00:17:12,205
<i>One of the performers
will be Jerry Seinfeld.</i>

303
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:14,599
<i>- Jerry, good morning.
- Thank you, Bryant.</i>

304
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:18,478
<i>Speaking of clothing, that is a very,
very unusual shirt you have on.</i>

305
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,081
<i>Yeah.</i>

306
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:24,759
<i>You're all kind of-
Kind of puffed up.</i>

307
00:17:24,929 --> 00:17:27,966
<i>- Yeah, it's a puffy shirt.
- You look kind of like a pirate.</i>

308
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:30,968
<i>Like a pirate.</i>

309
00:17:31,129 --> 00:17:34,485
<i>Anyway, you know, we're hoping
to raise enough money-</i>

310
00:17:34,649 --> 00:17:38,244
<i>Do you know-? You know- Look,
I'm sorry, it's just a very unusual shirt.</i>

311
00:17:38,409 --> 00:17:41,481
<i>It could be a whole new look for you.
You could put a patch over an eye.</i>

312
00:17:41,649 --> 00:17:45,324
<i>- You could be the pirate comedian.
- Yeah.</i>

313
00:17:46,129 --> 00:17:49,280
<i>- Will you wear the puffy shirt at the-?
- Look, it's not my shirt.</i>

314
00:17:49,449 --> 00:17:51,405
<i>- Whose shirt is it?
- What's the difference?</i>

315
00:17:51,569 --> 00:17:52,843
<i>I agreed to wear it.</i>

316
00:17:53,009 --> 00:17:56,081
<i>It's a puffy shirt.
I feel ridiculous in it.</i>

317
00:17:56,249 --> 00:17:59,719
<i>I think it's the stupidest shirt I've ever
seen, to be perfectly honest with you.</i>

318
00:17:59,889 --> 00:18:02,039
You bastard!

319
00:18:02,529 --> 00:18:05,168
<i>- Did you hear that?
- That I heard.</i>

320
00:18:08,609 --> 00:18:10,008
<i>All right, a little to the left.</i>

321
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:11,761
<i>Little higher. Good, perfect.</i>

322
00:18:11,929 --> 00:18:13,965
<i>- Like that?
- Just like that. Hold it. Good.</i>

323
00:18:14,129 --> 00:18:17,326
<i>Okay, let me get one more.
One more. Good.</i>

324
00:18:17,489 --> 00:18:19,286
<i>That's it. You're done.</i>

325
00:18:19,449 --> 00:18:21,121
- That's it?
- That's it.

326
00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:23,405
<i>And here's your check.</i>

327
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,844
<i>Thank you very much.
It was an honour.</i>

328
00:18:26,009 --> 00:18:27,601
Thank you.

329
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:34,999
<i>It was great working with you.
Your hands are beautiful.</i>

330
00:18:37,089 --> 00:18:39,444
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

331
00:18:39,609 --> 00:18:41,201
<i>You know, I was wondering...</i>

332
00:18:41,369 --> 00:18:44,566
<i>...if you're not doing anything later,
maybe you'd like to get together.</i>

333
00:18:56,409 --> 00:18:58,320
<i>You ruined me!
You ruined my career!</i>

334
00:18:58,529 --> 00:19:00,918
<i>Oh, just keep your voice down,
everyone can hear you.</i>

335
00:19:01,089 --> 00:19:02,408
<i>Well, I don't give a damn!</i>

336
00:19:02,569 --> 00:19:05,481
<i>If you talked this loud to begin with,
I wouldn't be in this costume.</i>

337
00:19:06,049 --> 00:19:09,007
<i>Hey, hey. You can't believe this.
Look at this check.</i>

338
00:19:09,169 --> 00:19:11,603
<i>They said I had the most
beautiful hands they ever saw...</i>

339
00:19:11,769 --> 00:19:15,603
<i>...except for this McKigney guy. This
girl gave me her number. I got it all.</i>

340
00:19:15,769 --> 00:19:17,407
<i>I'm busting. Jerry, I'm busting.</i>

341
00:19:17,569 --> 00:19:19,685
<i>I've never noticed your hands before,
let me see.</i>

342
00:19:19,849 --> 00:19:21,646
All right.

343
00:19:22,969 --> 00:19:24,846
<i>Yeah. Real nice.</i>

344
00:19:28,409 --> 00:19:29,558
<i>Nice shirt.</i>

345
00:19:31,969 --> 00:19:34,563
<i>What is this? Is this what
you wore on the show?</i>

346
00:19:34,729 --> 00:19:37,721
<i>- Yeah.
- Have you completely lost your mind?</i>

347
00:19:37,889 --> 00:19:39,561
<i>- Hey.
- Who's dressing you?</i>

348
00:19:39,729 --> 00:19:41,879
<i>You look like a complete idiot.</i>

349
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:43,323
<i>I wouldn't wipe my-</i>

350
00:19:51,809 --> 00:19:54,164
<i>- You ready?
- Yeah.</i>

351
00:19:58,209 --> 00:19:59,961
Hot, hot.

352
00:20:00,769 --> 00:20:04,887
<i>- I'm sorry.
- McKigney had a few good years.</i>

353
00:20:05,409 --> 00:20:07,001
<i>How do you forget
to turn off an iron?</i>

354
00:20:07,169 --> 00:20:09,603
<i>I was excited Jerry was putting on
the puffy shirt.</i>

355
00:20:09,769 --> 00:20:12,158
<i>My whole life is ruined
because of the puffy shirt.</i>

356
00:20:12,329 --> 00:20:16,083
<i>It didn't do me any good either. That
benefit was the worst show I ever did.</i>

357
00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:18,638
<i>Some of those heckles
were really uncalled for.</i>

358
00:20:18,809 --> 00:20:22,165
<i>"Avast ye, matey"?
What the hell does that mean?</i>

359
00:20:22,329 --> 00:20:24,047
<i>"Twenty degrees
off the starboard side.</i>

360
00:20:24,209 --> 00:20:27,007
<i>It's a Spanish galleon."
There's no comeback for that.</i>

361
00:20:28,129 --> 00:20:30,518
<i>Well, it got me fired
from the benefit committee.</i>

362
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:33,408
<i>You know, all those stores
cancelled out on her.</i>

363
00:20:33,569 --> 00:20:35,002
<i>She's finished.</i>

364
00:20:35,169 --> 00:20:37,285
<i>- We're finished.
- Really? What happened?</i>

365
00:20:37,449 --> 00:20:41,601
<i>I just can't be with someone
whose life is in complete disarray.</i>

366
00:20:43,729 --> 00:20:47,358
<i>- What happened to all the shirts?
- They gave them to Goodwill.</i>

367
00:20:48,769 --> 00:20:51,488
Puffy shirt. Puffy shirt.

368
00:20:55,729 --> 00:20:58,721
<i>Can you spare a little change
for an old buccaneer?</i>

369
00:21:00,729 --> 00:21:03,482
<i>You know, it's really not
a bad-looking shirt.</i>

370
00:21:12,769 --> 00:21:17,365
<i>Why do we always have to say,
"Excuse me"...</i>

371
00:21:17,529 --> 00:21:19,360
<i>...when we can't hear
what someone's saying?</i>

372
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:22,123
<i>Why are we so guilty and so-?
"Excuse me.</i>

373
00:21:22,289 --> 00:21:25,645
<i>Pardon me. I'm sorry."
Why can't, just once, I go:</i>

374
00:21:25,809 --> 00:21:28,243
<i>"Nope. Not loud enough"?</i>

375
00:21:28,409 --> 00:21:30,320
Why can't I do that?

376
00:21:31,889 --> 00:21:34,847
<i>Just once I would
like to have the guts...</i>

377
00:21:35,249 --> 00:21:36,762
<i>...you know, to make that judgment.</i>

378
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:40,046
<i>Someone mumbles something,
and you go, "Your fault.</i>

379
00:21:40,209 --> 00:21:43,565
<i>I'm not sorry,
because it's your fault."</i>
