1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,071
Professional tennis-

2
00:00:04,402 --> 00:00:06,962
I don't understand the shushing.
Why are they always shushing?

3
00:00:07,122 --> 00:00:09,636
Don't the players know
that we're there?

4
00:00:10,482 --> 00:00:14,157
Should we duck behind the seats
so they don't see us watching them?

5
00:00:14,322 --> 00:00:16,278
To me, tennis is basically
just Ping-Pong...

6
00:00:16,442 --> 00:00:19,115
...and the players
are standing on the table.

7
00:00:19,282 --> 00:00:21,113
That's all it is.

8
00:00:21,282 --> 00:00:22,715
And that goofy scoring.

9
00:00:22,882 --> 00:00:25,874
You win one point, all of a sudden
you're up by 15.

10
00:00:26,882 --> 00:00:30,636
Two points, 30-love. 30-love.

11
00:00:30,802 --> 00:00:33,680
Sounds like an English call girl.
"That'll be 30, love.

12
00:00:34,722 --> 00:00:38,078
And could you be a little quieter
next time, please?"

13
00:00:44,202 --> 00:00:46,955
Are these seats unbelievable,
or what?

14
00:00:47,122 --> 00:00:50,159
- Hey, where's the sunblock?
- Here.

15
00:00:50,882 --> 00:00:53,112
Twenty-five? You don't have
anything higher?

16
00:00:53,282 --> 00:00:57,116
- What, are you on Mercury?
- I need higher.

17
00:00:57,282 --> 00:00:59,842
This has PABA in it.
I need PABA-free.

18
00:01:00,682 --> 00:01:03,480
- You got a problem with PABA?
- I have a problem with PABA.

19
00:01:03,642 --> 00:01:07,157
- You don't even know what PABA is.
- I know enough to stay away from it.

20
00:01:10,082 --> 00:01:11,071
Thirty-love.

21
00:01:11,242 --> 00:01:14,632
- So you going to Todd's party?
- If somebody else drives. You going?

22
00:01:14,802 --> 00:01:17,600
- Gwen really wants to go.
- You're bringing a date to a party?

23
00:01:17,922 --> 00:01:19,150
No good?

24
00:01:19,322 --> 00:01:22,234
A party's a bad date situation.
It doesn't matter who you're with.

25
00:01:22,402 --> 00:01:23,994
You could be with J. Edgar Hoover.

26
00:01:24,162 --> 00:01:27,677
You don't wanna sit and talk with
Hoover all night. You want to circulate.

27
00:01:29,402 --> 00:01:32,041
Why'd you pick Hoover?
Is he that interesting to talk to?

28
00:01:32,202 --> 00:01:34,921
Well, with the law enforcement
and the cross-dressing...

29
00:01:35,082 --> 00:01:37,118
...seems like an interesting guy.

30
00:01:37,282 --> 00:01:38,510
Yeah, I guess.

31
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:40,593
What can I do?
I gotta take her with me.

32
00:01:40,762 --> 00:01:42,992
Todd introduced us. I'm obligated.

33
00:01:43,162 --> 00:01:45,881
That woman is absolutely stunning.

34
00:01:46,202 --> 00:01:49,035
- Who, the Croat?
- No, not the Croat. The lineswoman.

35
00:01:49,202 --> 00:01:51,921
That is the most beautiful lineswoman
I've ever seen.

36
00:01:52,082 --> 00:01:53,913
Yeah, she's a BL.

37
00:01:54,082 --> 00:01:57,677
- BL?
- Beautiful lineswoman.

38
00:01:59,362 --> 00:02:02,195
I'm gonna go to the concession stand
to get some real sunblock.

39
00:02:02,362 --> 00:02:04,717
You want anything? Jerry?

40
00:02:05,282 --> 00:02:06,510
Jerry?

41
00:02:09,042 --> 00:02:12,034
You know, I just heard
the Lexington line is out.

42
00:02:12,202 --> 00:02:14,955
You are kidding me. How am I
supposed to get to this meeting?

43
00:02:15,122 --> 00:02:16,919
Take a car service.
We have an account.

44
00:02:17,082 --> 00:02:18,834
No, forget it. I hate those.

45
00:02:19,002 --> 00:02:22,312
Every time I've taken one,
the driver will not stop talking to me.

46
00:02:22,482 --> 00:02:25,633
No matter how disinterested I seem,
he just keeps yakking away.

47
00:02:28,002 --> 00:02:30,357
Why does everything have
to have a social component?

48
00:02:30,522 --> 00:02:33,594
See, the stagecoach. Now, that
would've been a good situation for me.

49
00:02:33,762 --> 00:02:36,401
I'm in the coach, and the driver's
way up there on the stage.

50
00:02:36,562 --> 00:02:39,952
You're not gonna get a cab now,
4:30 on a Friday afternoon.

51
00:02:40,122 --> 00:02:41,874
Bring a magazine.
Keep your head down.

52
00:02:42,042 --> 00:02:43,475
Yeah, I guess that could work.

53
00:02:59,522 --> 00:03:03,037
And that is it.
Match to Ms. Natalia Baudone.

54
00:03:03,802 --> 00:03:05,758
Coming up next, men's singles.

55
00:03:05,922 --> 00:03:10,040
But for now, let's stop and look at
our beautiful tennis-centre backdrop.

56
00:03:10,402 --> 00:03:11,994
Hey!

57
00:03:12,482 --> 00:03:13,881
There's George.

58
00:03:14,042 --> 00:03:16,761
Holy cow. It's a scorcher.

59
00:03:18,122 --> 00:03:20,352
Boy, I bet you that guy
could cover a lot of court.

60
00:03:20,522 --> 00:03:24,151
Hey, buddy, they got a new
invention. It's caled a napkin.

61
00:03:24,322 --> 00:03:27,519
Wel, we'l tak e a station break
and continue with more action.

62
00:03:29,762 --> 00:03:32,481
Dag Hammarskjold Plaza, huh?

63
00:03:34,322 --> 00:03:37,632
Pendant Publishing,
that's books, right?

64
00:03:38,162 --> 00:03:39,720
Miss?

65
00:03:39,882 --> 00:03:42,157
- Pardon me?
- Books. That's what you do?

66
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:43,960
Yeah.

67
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:48,681
Yeah, I don't read much myself.
Well, you know, besides the paper.

68
00:03:48,842 --> 00:03:51,675
Yeah, a lot of people read to relax.
Not me.

69
00:03:51,842 --> 00:03:53,594
You know what I do?

70
00:03:53,762 --> 00:03:58,153
You know, I'm having a lot of trouble
hearing you back here, so...

71
00:03:58,322 --> 00:04:01,280
I said, you know what I do
when I want to relax?

72
00:04:02,162 --> 00:04:03,436
The jumble.

73
00:04:04,482 --> 00:04:06,552
Hey, do you make a book
of jumbles?

74
00:04:06,722 --> 00:04:10,078
I'm gonna have to be
honest with you.

75
00:04:10,242 --> 00:04:12,119
I'm going deaf.

76
00:04:12,282 --> 00:04:14,318
- Going deaf?
- What?

77
00:04:15,202 --> 00:04:17,352
Oh, I... I'm sorry.

78
00:04:17,522 --> 00:04:20,480
It can be very frustrating.

79
00:04:20,642 --> 00:04:23,031
Hey, what about a hearing aid?

80
00:04:23,202 --> 00:04:27,195
Am I fearing AIDS? Oh, yeah, sure.
Who isn't?

81
00:04:27,362 --> 00:04:29,592
But, you know,
you gotta live your life.

82
00:04:29,762 --> 00:04:32,435
No, no, no. I said-

83
00:04:32,602 --> 00:04:33,921
Forget it.

84
00:04:42,242 --> 00:04:44,039
I can't take my eyes
off this lineswoman.

85
00:04:44,202 --> 00:04:46,158
The woman is absolutely
mesmerizing.

86
00:04:46,322 --> 00:04:49,553
- Boy, you are really smitten.
- I gotta talk to her.

87
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:51,394
- What do you think?
- Cold?

88
00:04:51,562 --> 00:04:53,917
How you gonna do that?
You're not one of those guys.

89
00:04:54,082 --> 00:04:58,234
I'll psych myself into it like those
people that walk across the hot coals.

90
00:04:58,402 --> 00:05:01,917
But they're not mocked and humiliated
when they get to the other side.

91
00:05:02,082 --> 00:05:04,073
I have to. I won't be able
to live with myself.

92
00:05:04,242 --> 00:05:06,119
Wait. Jerry, there's
a bigger issue here.

93
00:05:06,282 --> 00:05:08,796
If you go through that wall
and become one of those guys...

94
00:05:08,962 --> 00:05:11,032
...I'll be left here on this side.

95
00:05:11,842 --> 00:05:14,561
- Take me with you.
- I can't.

96
00:05:16,322 --> 00:05:18,358
What are you gonna say?

97
00:05:18,522 --> 00:05:20,877
I don't know."Hi."

98
00:05:21,682 --> 00:05:25,197
You think you're going
to the other side with "hi"?

99
00:05:25,362 --> 00:05:27,273
You're not gonna make it.

100
00:05:29,322 --> 00:05:32,997
- Base to 92, come in.
- Yeah, this is 92.

101
00:05:33,162 --> 00:05:35,915
Yeah, after this, go back
to the city for a 6:00 pickup.

102
00:05:36,082 --> 00:05:37,117
Rightio.

103
00:05:37,282 --> 00:05:40,240
749 Bleek er.
The party's Hanks. Tom Hanks.

104
00:05:40,642 --> 00:05:41,995
Tom Hanks?

105
00:05:42,162 --> 00:05:45,837
After me, you're picking up
Tom Hanks? I love him.

106
00:05:46,362 --> 00:05:49,877
So I guess your hearing
goes in and out, huh?

107
00:05:50,762 --> 00:05:53,595
- Yeah. Yes, it-
- Yeah, you know what I think?

108
00:05:53,762 --> 00:05:55,639
I think you made
that whole thing up.

109
00:05:55,802 --> 00:05:58,794
- No, no. I-
- Yeah, yeah. I know your type.

110
00:05:58,962 --> 00:06:01,840
You're too good to make conversation
with someone like me.

111
00:06:02,002 --> 00:06:05,312
Oh, God forbid you
could discuss the jumbles.

112
00:06:05,762 --> 00:06:08,196
But to go so far as to pretend
you're almost deaf?

113
00:06:08,362 --> 00:06:11,115
I mean, that is
truly disgusting, miss.

114
00:06:11,282 --> 00:06:12,715
And Mr. Tom Hanks-

115
00:06:13,002 --> 00:06:17,314
May I say he, too, would be
disgusted by your behaviour.

116
00:06:20,362 --> 00:06:22,239
Excuse me.

117
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:23,910
Excuse me.

118
00:06:25,042 --> 00:06:26,475
Oh, that's nice.

119
00:06:26,642 --> 00:06:29,600
That's right, ignore me.
That's real polite.

120
00:06:29,762 --> 00:06:33,038
Yeah, nobody's even talking to you.
Oh, you're a big lineswoman.

121
00:06:33,202 --> 00:06:36,717
Oh, like that's some kind
of a cool job. I know your type.

122
00:06:36,882 --> 00:06:39,521
Think you're too good for everyone.
But it's women like you-

123
00:06:39,682 --> 00:06:42,071
Oh, well- What, are you deaf?

124
00:06:42,682 --> 00:06:44,877
Bingo.

125
00:06:48,562 --> 00:06:52,316
- And you're saying she's deaf?
- I'm not saying she's deaf. She's deaf.

126
00:06:52,482 --> 00:06:54,313
- Can't hear a thing.
- Can't hear a thing.

127
00:06:54,482 --> 00:06:56,791
- You're gonna go out with her?
- Isn't that something?

128
00:06:56,962 --> 00:06:57,997
- Hey.
- Hi.

129
00:06:58,162 --> 00:07:00,153
- Yeah, you know, I know how to sign.
- Really?

130
00:07:00,322 --> 00:07:03,473
When I was 8, I had a deaf cousin
who lived with us for about a year.

131
00:07:03,642 --> 00:07:07,635
Of course, you know, I haven't
been able to do it in a while.

132
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:08,791
What is this about?

133
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:11,357
I met this deaf lineswoman
at the tennis match.

134
00:07:11,522 --> 00:07:14,639
You are kidding. That is amazing.

135
00:07:15,162 --> 00:07:16,800
I just took a car service from work.

136
00:07:16,962 --> 00:07:19,920
To get the driver not to talk to me,
I pretended I was going deaf.

137
00:07:20,322 --> 00:07:23,155
- Good plan.
- It didn't work. He caught me hearing.

138
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,677
All right. It's terrible,
but I'm not terrible.

139
00:07:26,842 --> 00:07:27,991
- No.
- No.

140
00:07:28,162 --> 00:07:31,677
No. When I shoo squirrels away,
I always say, "Get out of here."

141
00:07:31,842 --> 00:07:34,754
I never, ever throw things at them
and try to injure them...

142
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:36,560
- ... like other people.
- That's nice.

143
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:39,839
Yeah. And when I see freaks in the
street, I never, ever stare at them.

144
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:41,594
And yet I'm careful
not to look away.

145
00:07:41,762 --> 00:07:45,198
See, because I wanna make
the freaks feel comfortable.

146
00:07:46,682 --> 00:07:48,354
- That's nice for the freaks.
- Yeah.

147
00:07:48,522 --> 00:07:50,513
I don't pouf my hair when I go
to the movies...

148
00:07:50,682 --> 00:07:52,001
...so people behind me can see.

149
00:07:52,162 --> 00:07:55,359
I gotta make it up to this guy.
I won't be able to live with myself.

150
00:07:55,522 --> 00:07:57,877
- What can I do?
- Why don't you get him some tickets.

151
00:07:58,042 --> 00:08:00,237
- Your friend works at a ticket agency.
- Yeah. Pete.

152
00:08:00,402 --> 00:08:02,313
- He can get you tickets to something.
- Really?

153
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,154
Like a rock concert.
Whatever you like.

154
00:08:04,322 --> 00:08:07,359
- Oh, great. Thanks, Kramer.
- Yeah. You got it.

155
00:08:07,522 --> 00:08:10,514
Hey, Jerry, do me a favour.
Next time you see that lineswoman...

156
00:08:10,682 --> 00:08:13,037
...ask her how those ball boys
get those jobs.

157
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:14,874
I would love to be able to do that.

158
00:08:15,042 --> 00:08:18,637
I think perhaps you've overlooked
one of the key aspects of this activity.

159
00:08:18,802 --> 00:08:24,001
It's ball boys, not ball men.
There are no ball men.

160
00:08:25,082 --> 00:08:27,198
I think he's right.
I've never seen a ball man.

161
00:08:27,362 --> 00:08:30,638
- Well, there ought to be ball men.
- All right, I'll talk to her.

162
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:35,034
You wanna be a ball man, go ahead.
Break the ball barrier. Hey!

163
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:39,357
A friend of mine from work said
she saw George at the tennis match...

164
00:08:39,522 --> 00:08:41,911
- ... on TV yesterday.
- Yeah. Yeah, me too.

165
00:08:42,082 --> 00:08:44,880
He was at the snack bar
eating a hot fudge sundae.

166
00:08:45,042 --> 00:08:47,351
He had it all over his face.

167
00:08:47,522 --> 00:08:49,752
He's wearing that chocolate
on his face like a beard.

168
00:08:49,922 --> 00:08:53,073
And they got in there
really nice and tight, and he's:

169
00:08:56,962 --> 00:08:58,998
- I'm sorry, George.
- But...

170
00:08:59,682 --> 00:09:02,879
...I don't understand.
Things were going so great.

171
00:09:03,322 --> 00:09:05,278
What happened?
Something must've happened.

172
00:09:05,762 --> 00:09:07,798
It's not you. It's me.

173
00:09:08,642 --> 00:09:12,635
You're giving me
the "it's not you, it's me"routine?

174
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:17,273
I invented "it's not you, it's me."
Nobody tells me it's them, not me.

175
00:09:17,442 --> 00:09:20,002
- If it's anybody, it's me.
- All right.

176
00:09:20,162 --> 00:09:23,632
- George, it's you.
- You are damn right it's me.

177
00:09:23,962 --> 00:09:26,476
- I was just trying to-
- I know what you were trying to do.

178
00:09:26,642 --> 00:09:29,839
- Nobody does it better than me.
- I'm sure you do it very well.

179
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:34,473
Yes, well, unfortunately, you'll never
get the chance to find out.

180
00:09:37,282 --> 00:09:40,957
- But I thought things were going great.
- Yeah, so did I.

181
00:09:41,402 --> 00:09:43,154
- Did she say why?
- No.

182
00:09:43,922 --> 00:09:47,358
She tried to give me
the "it's not you, it's me"routine.

183
00:09:47,842 --> 00:09:50,754
- But that's your routine.
- Yeah.

184
00:09:51,922 --> 00:09:54,390
Well, apparently word's out.

185
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:58,834
Hey. Hey, Georgie,
I saw you on TV yesterday.

186
00:10:00,162 --> 00:10:01,436
Really? At the tennis match?

187
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:04,162
Yeah. You were at the snack bar
eating the hot fudge sundae.

188
00:10:04,322 --> 00:10:06,711
Get out of here.
I didn't see any cameras there.

189
00:10:06,882 --> 00:10:09,271
Oh, the camera was... there.

190
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,479
And the announcers, they made
a couple of cracks about you.

191
00:10:14,482 --> 00:10:16,074
Cracks?

192
00:10:16,402 --> 00:10:18,040
What were they saying?

193
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:19,999
That you had ice cream
all over your face.

194
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:22,312
They were talking about
how funny you looked.

195
00:10:22,482 --> 00:10:26,077
Oh, my God. Maybe Gwen saw it.
Maybe that's what did it.

196
00:10:26,242 --> 00:10:28,517
Well, I'll tell you,
it wasn't a pretty sight.

197
00:10:30,042 --> 00:10:32,476
She must've seen me
eating it on TV.

198
00:10:32,642 --> 00:10:34,872
She sees you with hot fudge
on your face and ends it?

199
00:10:35,042 --> 00:10:39,001
- You think she'd be that superficial?
- Why not? I would be.

200
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:44,710
Hello? Oh, hi, Dad.

201
00:10:44,882 --> 00:10:46,440
You saw him?

202
00:10:46,882 --> 00:10:50,636
Really, with the ice cream?
All right, I'll talk to you later. Bye.

203
00:10:50,802 --> 00:10:52,315
- Your parents saw me on TV?
- Yeah.

204
00:10:52,482 --> 00:10:54,552
This is a nightmare.
Kramer, how long was I on?

205
00:10:54,722 --> 00:10:56,599
It felt like eight seconds.

206
00:10:56,762 --> 00:10:59,401
One-1000. Two-1000.
Three-1000-

207
00:10:59,562 --> 00:11:03,271
I heard you really inhaled that thing.
Did anyone tape it?

208
00:11:04,322 --> 00:11:05,835
Can we move on?

209
00:11:06,602 --> 00:11:08,399
- What?
- He thinks Gwen broke up with him...

210
00:11:08,562 --> 00:11:10,996
...because she saw him
eating the ice cream on TV.

211
00:11:11,162 --> 00:11:13,676
Come on. If she's that superficial,
you don't want her.

212
00:11:13,842 --> 00:11:15,912
Yes, I do.

213
00:11:18,562 --> 00:11:20,712
I guess you're not going
to Todd's party on Friday.

214
00:11:20,882 --> 00:11:22,713
Well, I can't now.
Gwen's gonna be there.

215
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,634
She should be the one
that shouldn't go.

216
00:11:24,802 --> 00:11:28,158
If a couple breaks up with plans to go
to a neutral place, who withdraws?

217
00:11:28,322 --> 00:11:30,597
- What's the etiquette?
- Excellent question.

218
00:11:30,762 --> 00:11:32,354
I mean, I think she should withdraw.

219
00:11:32,522 --> 00:11:36,674
She's the breaker. He's the breakee.
He needs to get on with his life.

220
00:11:36,842 --> 00:11:38,241
- I beg to differ.
- Really?

221
00:11:38,562 --> 00:11:40,314
He's the loser.

222
00:11:43,882 --> 00:11:49,115
She's the victor. To the victor
belong the spoils.

223
00:11:49,282 --> 00:11:51,591
Well, I don't care.
I don't want to go anyway.

224
00:11:51,762 --> 00:11:53,673
I don't wanna fight that traffic
on Friday.

225
00:11:53,842 --> 00:11:55,400
We can take my office's car service.

226
00:11:55,562 --> 00:11:57,200
- Really?
- Yeah. They don't know.

227
00:11:57,362 --> 00:11:58,954
- All right. I'll see you later.
- Okay.

228
00:11:59,122 --> 00:12:01,761
- Hey, Georgie, you coming?
- Yeah.

229
00:12:02,082 --> 00:12:04,915
"To the victor go the spoils."

230
00:12:07,682 --> 00:12:08,876
What are you doing tonight?

231
00:12:09,042 --> 00:12:12,239
I got a date with Laura,
the lineswoman.

232
00:12:13,082 --> 00:12:14,834
Why?

233
00:12:16,882 --> 00:12:20,921
- What are you doing?
- I was just gonna wander the streets.

234
00:12:21,082 --> 00:12:24,472
I don't want to tag along with you
or anything.

235
00:12:26,842 --> 00:12:28,560
You wanted to come with us?

236
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:31,034
Jerry, please.

237
00:12:31,202 --> 00:12:33,158
It's very nice, but...

238
00:12:33,322 --> 00:12:35,358
Where would we be going?

239
00:12:37,922 --> 00:12:43,280
So I've got ice cream all over my face.
There were no napkins there.

240
00:12:43,442 --> 00:12:46,354
Whoever is responsible for stocking
that concession stand...

241
00:12:46,522 --> 00:12:48,001
...cost me a relationship.

242
00:12:48,682 --> 00:12:51,196
- They never have napkins there.
- Let's get the check.

243
00:12:53,242 --> 00:12:57,030
Is this considered signing? Do you
do this when you ask for the check?

244
00:12:57,202 --> 00:13:00,399
Really? I know a sign.
That's my first sign.

245
00:13:04,162 --> 00:13:06,039
That couple is breaking up.

246
00:13:07,562 --> 00:13:09,280
They're breaking up?

247
00:13:09,442 --> 00:13:11,592
- How do you know?
- She reads lips.

248
00:13:12,722 --> 00:13:14,394
What are they saying now?

249
00:13:15,522 --> 00:13:18,559
"It's not you. It's me."

250
00:13:24,242 --> 00:13:25,755
Oh, my God.

251
00:13:25,922 --> 00:13:28,152
I just had a great idea.

252
00:13:28,602 --> 00:13:32,436
She could come to the party tomorrow
and read Gwen's lips for me.

253
00:13:34,002 --> 00:13:35,754
What?

254
00:13:36,602 --> 00:13:38,638
We bring her to the party...

255
00:13:38,842 --> 00:13:42,118
...and she tells me what Gwen
is saying about me.

256
00:13:43,642 --> 00:13:45,473
She's not a novelty act, George...

257
00:13:45,642 --> 00:13:49,112
...that you hire out for weddings
and bar mitzvahs.

258
00:13:49,282 --> 00:13:52,797
Look, it's a skill, just like juggling.

259
00:13:52,962 --> 00:13:55,681
She probably enjoys showing it off.

260
00:13:57,282 --> 00:14:01,594
I don't know, George.
I'm not sure about this.

261
00:14:02,562 --> 00:14:04,996
Would you ask her? Just ask her.

262
00:14:06,402 --> 00:14:09,474
- If she says no, case closed.
- All right.

263
00:14:12,322 --> 00:14:16,873
- Laura, George was wondering if-
- Sure. I'll do it.

264
00:14:19,722 --> 00:14:22,316
- So I really had a good time.
- Yeah, me too.

265
00:14:22,482 --> 00:14:24,916
- Wanna go to the party on Friday?
- Yeah.

266
00:14:25,082 --> 00:14:27,038
All right, we're taking a car service.

267
00:14:27,202 --> 00:14:29,158
So we'll swing by and pick you up.

268
00:14:29,762 --> 00:14:32,230
How about 6?

269
00:14:32,402 --> 00:14:34,313
Six is good.

270
00:14:35,362 --> 00:14:37,751
You got a problem with 6?

271
00:14:39,682 --> 00:14:42,242
What? What?

272
00:14:48,082 --> 00:14:49,913
Okay, listen up, people.

273
00:14:50,082 --> 00:14:53,199
There are plenty of you here,
but we've only got two spots to fill.

274
00:14:53,362 --> 00:14:54,795
So good luck.

275
00:14:54,962 --> 00:14:58,875
Hey, pops, isn't there a better way
to spend your twilight years?

276
00:14:59,522 --> 00:15:02,400
Well, I may be old, but I'm spry.

277
00:15:03,562 --> 00:15:07,191
The tryout lasts three and a half
to four hours.

278
00:15:07,362 --> 00:15:10,081
- Are you up for it?
- Oh, I'll be up for it, punk.

279
00:15:26,042 --> 00:15:29,512
See, I was saying "six,"
but she thought I was saying "sex."

280
00:15:29,682 --> 00:15:31,354
We straightened
the whole thing out.

281
00:15:31,522 --> 00:15:33,513
- She confused "six"with "sex"?
- Yeah.

282
00:15:33,922 --> 00:15:37,198
If she can't tell "six"from "sex,"how's
she gonna lip read across a room?

283
00:15:37,362 --> 00:15:40,957
- "Six"and "sex"are close.
- It's two completely different sounds:

284
00:15:41,122 --> 00:15:42,555
And:

285
00:15:44,322 --> 00:15:45,550
It seems like a problem.

286
00:15:45,722 --> 00:15:48,634
Well, I'm not dating
any other deaf women.

287
00:15:49,242 --> 00:15:51,995
Hey, guess who's gonna be
the new ball man for the finals?

288
00:15:52,162 --> 00:15:53,277
- You're kidding.
- Yeah.

289
00:15:53,442 --> 00:15:56,240
They said they never saw anybody
go after balls with such gusto.

290
00:15:56,882 --> 00:15:58,918
- When is that car service coming?
- Five minutes.

291
00:15:59,082 --> 00:16:02,074
It's gonna pick us up, then Elaine.
Laura's gonna meet us there.

292
00:16:02,242 --> 00:16:05,518
If this lip-reading thing works tonight,
you know how incredible it'll be?

293
00:16:05,682 --> 00:16:08,799
- It's like having Superman for a friend.
- I know. It's like x-ray vision.

294
00:16:08,962 --> 00:16:12,796
If we could just harness this power
and use it for our own personal gain...

295
00:16:12,962 --> 00:16:15,157
- ... there'd be no stopping us.
- Hey, hey, hey.

296
00:16:15,322 --> 00:16:18,712
I hear you got some lip reader
working for you. Let me use her once.

297
00:16:18,882 --> 00:16:20,361
- Can't do it, Newman.
- But, Jerry...

298
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:22,558
...we got this new supervisor
at the post office.

299
00:16:22,722 --> 00:16:25,031
He's working behind glass.
They're talking about me.

300
00:16:25,202 --> 00:16:28,433
They're gonna transfer me. I know it!
Two hours. Give me two hours.

301
00:16:28,602 --> 00:16:30,558
It's not gonna happen!

302
00:16:31,042 --> 00:16:34,352
All right. All right.
All right, you go ahead.

303
00:16:34,522 --> 00:16:37,400
You go ahead. You keep it secret.
But you remember this:

304
00:16:37,562 --> 00:16:42,955
When you control the mail,
you control information.

305
00:16:45,442 --> 00:16:47,353
Just pull over right by
that stop sign.

306
00:16:47,522 --> 00:16:50,082
- Pardon me, sir?
- I said, pull over by the stop sign.

307
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:54,679
Oh, sorry. You'll have to forgive me.
I can't hear a damn thing.

308
00:16:54,842 --> 00:16:57,117
Went to a rock concert
last night at the Garden.

309
00:16:57,602 --> 00:17:00,560
My seats were right up
against the speaker.

310
00:17:00,722 --> 00:17:03,680
It's a heavy metal group,
Metalli-something.

311
00:17:03,842 --> 00:17:04,831
Ca.

312
00:17:05,002 --> 00:17:06,560
- What?
- Ca.

313
00:17:06,722 --> 00:17:09,031
My ears are still ringing.

314
00:17:09,642 --> 00:17:12,714
Some woman's idea of a joke.

315
00:17:14,682 --> 00:17:16,798
- Hey.
- Hi.

316
00:17:18,762 --> 00:17:20,514
- Get out. Get out!
- We'll never get there.

317
00:17:20,682 --> 00:17:21,671
- Go on!
- Okay.

318
00:17:21,842 --> 00:17:24,515
Hey! Shut the door.

319
00:17:29,522 --> 00:17:34,152
The whole idea of the car service
was so I wouldn't have to fight traffic.

320
00:17:36,482 --> 00:17:38,438
I know, I'm late. Hey,
now I know two signs.

321
00:17:38,602 --> 00:17:40,479
"Check"and "late."

322
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:43,554
Hey, this is my friend you helped
become the first ball man.

323
00:17:43,722 --> 00:17:44,950
Congratulations.

324
00:17:53,402 --> 00:17:56,280
She doesn't know
what she's talking about.

325
00:17:58,002 --> 00:17:59,754
Guys, you made it.

326
00:18:00,482 --> 00:18:01,631
- Hey.
- Hey, buddy.

327
00:18:01,802 --> 00:18:04,714
- Hey, Todd.
- Sorry to hear about Gwen.

328
00:18:04,882 --> 00:18:07,635
Why, did she say something
about why she broke up with me?

329
00:18:07,802 --> 00:18:10,396
No. Tonight will be the first chance
I've had to talk to her.

330
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:11,996
Really?

331
00:18:12,162 --> 00:18:14,153
Look, George,
I'm friends with both of you...

332
00:18:14,322 --> 00:18:18,554
...but I can't betray her confidence
by telling you anything.

333
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:22,920
I wouldn't hear of it, Todd.
It's none of my business.

334
00:18:23,082 --> 00:18:26,074
But you should try and find out
everything you possibly can.

335
00:18:26,242 --> 00:18:29,871
In fact, I'll even stay all the way
over on the other side of the room...

336
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:33,512
...just so there's no chance
of me overhearing anything.

337
00:18:33,682 --> 00:18:36,719
- You are so centred.
- Hey.

338
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:38,634
I've grown up.

339
00:18:38,802 --> 00:18:41,794
Oh, my God. There she is.
Go ahead. Go ahead.

340
00:18:42,602 --> 00:18:45,275
- Let's go, let's go. Get in position.
- What?

341
00:18:46,562 --> 00:18:49,554
All right, all right.
What are they saying?

342
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:52,632
- "Hi, Gwen.""Hi, Tide."
- High tide?

343
00:18:52,802 --> 00:18:54,838
"Hi, Todd."

344
00:18:55,042 --> 00:18:56,794
"You got something
between your teeth."

345
00:18:56,962 --> 00:18:59,760
- Where?
- No, that's what he said.

346
00:19:00,642 --> 00:19:04,157
"That's interesting. I love carrots,
but I hate carrot soup.

347
00:19:04,642 --> 00:19:07,520
And I hate peas,
but I love pea soup."

348
00:19:07,682 --> 00:19:10,150
- So do I.
- This is so wild.

349
00:19:10,322 --> 00:19:12,074
Can I borrow her
for a few hours tomorrow?

350
00:19:12,242 --> 00:19:14,039
No. Then I'd have to lend her
to everybody.

351
00:19:14,522 --> 00:19:16,831
I don't envy you, Todd.
This place is gonna be a mess.

352
00:19:17,002 --> 00:19:20,551
Maybe you can stick around,
and we can sweep together.

353
00:19:20,722 --> 00:19:23,998
"Why don't you stick around,
and we can sleep together."

354
00:19:24,162 --> 00:19:26,232
- What?
- "You want me to sleep with you?"

355
00:19:26,402 --> 00:19:29,280
- I don't wanna sweep alone.
- He says, "I don't wanna sleep alone."

356
00:19:29,442 --> 00:19:32,639
And she says- Oh, boy.
"Love to."

357
00:19:32,802 --> 00:19:34,554
All right, that's it.

358
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:37,515
You get rid of me, now the two
of you are gonna sleep together?

359
00:19:37,682 --> 00:19:40,879
- What? You're crazy.
- "What? You're crazy."

360
00:19:41,042 --> 00:19:43,920
- I heard your whole conversation.
- How?

361
00:19:45,202 --> 00:19:47,193
- "How?"
- I can read lips.

362
00:19:47,362 --> 00:19:51,037
- You said, "Let's sleep together."
- No, I didn't. I said "sweep."

363
00:19:51,202 --> 00:19:53,397
Let's sweep together,
like with a broom.

364
00:19:53,562 --> 00:19:54,711
- Cleaning up.
- "Cleaning up."

365
00:19:54,882 --> 00:19:56,031
Sweep?

366
00:19:56,202 --> 00:19:57,760
- Yes. Sweep.
- "Yes. Sweep."

367
00:19:57,922 --> 00:19:59,355
- Cut it.
- George says, "Cut it."

368
00:19:59,522 --> 00:20:00,511
- Cut it.
- George says-

369
00:20:00,682 --> 00:20:03,196
Cut it. Would you stop signing?!

370
00:20:03,362 --> 00:20:05,432
- What?
- They said "sweep together,"idiots.

371
00:20:05,602 --> 00:20:07,513
Not "sleep together."

372
00:20:09,202 --> 00:20:11,113
Look, I know how to sign.

373
00:20:11,282 --> 00:20:13,512
My eye! My eye!

374
00:20:14,882 --> 00:20:18,318
This is really amazing, getting to see
Monica Seles play in the finals.

375
00:20:18,482 --> 00:20:21,235
I know. And in the first tournament
of her comeback.

376
00:20:38,522 --> 00:20:42,151
Thus ends the great
ball man experiment.

377
00:20:51,522 --> 00:20:54,320
- You with the tennis centre?
- Yeah.

378
00:20:54,882 --> 00:20:57,521
Hey, how about that ball man
injuring Monica Seles?

379
00:20:57,682 --> 00:21:00,719
- Wasn't that something?
- I'm deaf.

380
00:21:12,042 --> 00:21:16,194
I've always been a big fan
of the little check move, you know?

381
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:19,715
"Can I get the check? The check."

382
00:21:19,882 --> 00:21:22,601
Unless the waiter's not too sharp.
Then you gotta total it up.

383
00:21:22,762 --> 00:21:23,990
"I want the check."

384
00:21:24,922 --> 00:21:26,560
They come over,
"Do you want the check?"

385
00:21:26,722 --> 00:21:29,555
"No, I want to be pen pals.
Can't you see what I'm doing here?

386
00:21:29,722 --> 00:21:32,953
I'm trying to be cool
and impress people."

387
00:21:53,282 --> 00:21:55,273
