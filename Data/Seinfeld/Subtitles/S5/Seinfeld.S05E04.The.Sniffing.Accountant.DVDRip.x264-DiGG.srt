1
00:00:02,209 --> 00:00:03,278
To me, government...</i>

2
00:00:04,809 --> 00:00:06,447
...is basically parents for adults.</i>

3
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:10,121
Especially the IRS. The IRS is like
Ward and June Cleaver...</i>

4
00:00:10,689 --> 00:00:13,157
...and we're all
Wally and the Beaver.</i>

5
00:00:13,329 --> 00:00:15,126
And your accountant
is Eddie Haskell...</i>

6
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:17,883
...showing you all these neat tricks
to get away with stuff.</i>

7
00:00:18,609 --> 00:00:20,122
That's fine, unless you get audited.</i>

8
00:00:20,289 --> 00:00:22,723
Then you don't want some
wise guy in a suit going:</i>

9
00:00:22,889 --> 00:00:26,040
"You have a very
lovely office here, sir."</i>

10
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:29,406
Because jail is the government's
way of sending you to your room.</i>

11
00:00:29,569 --> 00:00:32,845
And when you meet Whitey
and Lumpy in the joint...</i>

12
00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:36,766
...there's really gonna be
something wrong with the Beaver.</i>

13
00:00:42,529 --> 00:00:44,121
- Does he like you?
- What do you think?</i>

14
00:00:44,289 --> 00:00:46,325
- Do you like him?
- Yeah, I like him. Definitely.</i>

15
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:47,683
I like him a lot.</i>

16
00:00:47,849 --> 00:00:50,283
- So, what's wrong with him?
- Nothing, and I've looked.</i>

17
00:00:50,449 --> 00:00:52,644
Well, I'm sure you'll find something.</i>

18
00:00:52,809 --> 00:00:54,527
- So how'd you meet him?
- In the office.</i>

19
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:56,441
- So he's a writer?
- Yeah.</i>

20
00:00:56,609 --> 00:00:59,282
- Yeah, big surprise.
- I was sitting on the reception desk.</i>

21
00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:01,440
I was looking pretty hot.</i>

22
00:01:01,609 --> 00:01:04,362
- I was wearing my slingback pumps.
- What are those?</i>

23
00:01:04,529 --> 00:01:07,168
Ask your mother.
You live with her now, don't you?</i>

24
00:01:07,849 --> 00:01:09,328
Anyway...

25
00:01:09,489 --> 00:01:12,367
...then this guy comes up to me,
and he starts feeling my jacket...</i>

26
00:01:12,529 --> 00:01:14,918
...between his thumb
and forefinger like this.</i>

27
00:01:15,089 --> 00:01:17,364
- So, what'd you do?
- I said, "What do you think?"

28
00:01:17,529 --> 00:01:18,962
And he said, "Gabardine?"</i>

29
00:01:19,129 --> 00:01:21,882
And I said, "Yeah."That was it.</i>

30
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:26,482
- Just felt your material?
- Yeah. Jake Jarmel.</i>

31
00:01:27,169 --> 00:01:29,319
- Sounds like a cool guy.
- Sounds like a jerk.</i>

32
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:32,128
Felt your material, come on.</i>

33
00:01:32,289 --> 00:01:35,087
- Jerry, where'd you get that sweater?
- In the back of my closet.</i>

34
00:01:35,249 --> 00:01:38,127
I think that's what the back
of closets are for.</i>

35
00:01:39,089 --> 00:01:40,522
Hey, that's Barry.</i>

36
00:01:40,689 --> 00:01:42,122
Lookit. Barry.

37
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:43,768
- Hey.
- Hi.</i>

38
00:01:43,929 --> 00:01:46,568
- Who is that?
- That's Barry Prophet, our accountant.</i>

39
00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:49,084
I don't know how can you let
this guy handle your money.</i>

40
00:01:49,249 --> 00:01:52,161
Not my money. He handles
Jerry's money. He just does my taxes.</i>

41
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:53,808
- Barry, how you doing?
- How are you?</i>

42
00:01:53,969 --> 00:01:55,322
- This is my friend George.
- Hey.</i>

43
00:01:55,489 --> 00:01:57,207
What are you doing
in this neighbourhood?</i>

44
00:01:57,369 --> 00:01:58,848
Nothing, really.</i>

45
00:01:59,449 --> 00:02:01,485
- You... You eat here?
- Yeah.</i>

46
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:04,288
- So how's my money?
- Well, it's still green.</i>

47
00:02:04,449 --> 00:02:06,280
- What, do you got a cold?
- No. No.

48
00:02:06,929 --> 00:02:10,205
- Look at that ring.
- Oh, you like that?</i>

49
00:02:12,009 --> 00:02:13,442
Hey, say, where's the bathroom?</i>

50
00:02:13,609 --> 00:02:15,520
Bathroom?
Bathroom's right over there.</i>

51
00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:17,327
Great.</i>

52
00:02:19,089 --> 00:02:20,283
Did you see that?</i>

53
00:02:20,449 --> 00:02:22,246
- See what?
- Yes, I saw that.</i>

54
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:24,286
- What?
- What was all that sniffing?

55
00:02:24,449 --> 00:02:26,440
- I don't know.
- You don't think...?

56
00:02:26,609 --> 00:02:28,884
Oh, no. Come on, Jerry.</i>

57
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:31,563
He was definitely sniffing.</i>

58
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:34,844
I mean, what if-?
This guy's got all my money.</i>

59
00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:36,840
Plus, I got some of Kramer's money
with him.</i>

60
00:02:37,009 --> 00:02:39,079
He can write checks to himself
from my account.</i>

61
00:02:39,249 --> 00:02:41,604
I've known this guy since college.
He doesn't do drugs.</i>

62
00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:44,761
- Then what was all that sniffing?
- Maybe it's the cold weather.</i>

63
00:02:44,929 --> 00:02:46,282
Today's not cold.

64
00:02:46,449 --> 00:02:49,327
All right, I gotta get going.
My parents are expecting me.</i>

65
00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:53,084
Don't forget to wash
your hands before supper.</i>

66
00:02:58,049 --> 00:03:00,358
What do you need
all that ketchup for?</i>

67
00:03:01,929 --> 00:03:03,965
This is my ketchup.</i>

68
00:03:04,369 --> 00:03:05,643
I bought this ketchup...</i>

69
00:03:05,809 --> 00:03:08,721
...just so I could have
as much as I want.</i>

70
00:03:11,089 --> 00:03:14,206
So I...
I talked to Phil Kassikoff today.</i>

71
00:03:14,369 --> 00:03:15,848
Phil Kassikoff?

72
00:03:16,009 --> 00:03:18,079
Yeah. You know, my friend,
the bra salesman?</i>

73
00:03:18,609 --> 00:03:20,440
He says they're looking
for somebody...</i>

74
00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:23,077
...so I got you an interview
next Friday with his boss.</i>

75
00:03:23,249 --> 00:03:25,240
- Next Friday? What time?
- Two o'clock.</i>

76
00:03:25,809 --> 00:03:29,006
That's my whole afternoon.
I was gonna look for sneakers.</i>

77
00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:31,080
You can look for sneakers
the next day!</i>

78
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:35,077
He doesn't know anything
about bras.</i>

79
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:39,880
I know a little.</i>

80
00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:42,207
Besides, what do you
have to know?</i>

81
00:03:42,369 --> 00:03:46,442
Well, it wouldn't hurt to go in
and be able to discuss it intelligently.</i>

82
00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:48,679
Maybe you should take a look
at a few bras.</i>

83
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:50,680
Where's your bra?
Give him a bra to look at.</i>

84
00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:52,202
I'm not giving him a bra.

85
00:03:52,369 --> 00:03:55,406
- Why not?
- I don't need him looking at my bra.</i>

86
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,161
Fine. He'll go into the interview...</i>

87
00:03:57,329 --> 00:03:59,285
...he wouldn't know
what he's talking about.</i>

88
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:01,167
Do we have to...?</i>

89
00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:03,285
You don't even know
what they're made from.</i>

90
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:06,839
- They're made from Lycra spandex.
- Get out of here. Lycra spandex?</i>

91
00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:09,204
I think they are made
from Lycra spandex.</i>

92
00:04:09,369 --> 00:04:11,200
- Wanna bet? How much?
- I'm not betting.</i>

93
00:04:11,369 --> 00:04:15,078
- Take a look.
- All right, I'll get a bra.</i>

94
00:04:15,249 --> 00:04:18,002
I don't know what the big problem is
getting a bra.</i>

95
00:04:18,169 --> 00:04:19,648
She doesn't wanna get a bra.</i>

96
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:22,603
I'm not saying, "Go to the library
and read the history."</i>

97
00:04:22,769 --> 00:04:25,522
But it wouldn't kill you
to know a little bit about it.</i>

98
00:04:25,689 --> 00:04:27,759
All right, it wouldn't kill me.</i>

99
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:32,646
How long does it take to find a bra?</i>

100
00:04:33,009 --> 00:04:34,601
What's going on in there?</i>

101
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:37,966
You ask me to get a pair of
underwear, I'm back in two seconds.</i>

102
00:04:39,249 --> 00:04:41,717
You know about the cup sizes
and all?</i>

103
00:04:43,809 --> 00:04:48,007
- They have different cups.
- Yeah, I know about the cups.</i>

104
00:04:50,929 --> 00:04:52,806
You got the A...</i>

105
00:04:53,449 --> 00:04:54,723
...the B...</i>

106
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:56,368
...the C...</i>

107
00:04:56,769 --> 00:04:59,078
...the D. That's the biggest.</i>

108
00:05:00,289 --> 00:05:02,120
I know the D is the biggest.</i>

109
00:05:02,289 --> 00:05:05,884
I base my whole life on knowing
that the D is the biggest.</i>

110
00:05:06,049 --> 00:05:08,244
- Here. Here's the bra.
- Let me see it.</i>

111
00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:10,843
"One hundred percent
Lycra spandex."</i>

112
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:12,920
- Let me see.
- I told you.</i>

113
00:05:13,089 --> 00:05:16,206
Here. You think you know
everything.</i>

114
00:05:17,689 --> 00:05:19,247
That's surprising.

115
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:21,481
All right, what else?</i>

116
00:05:21,649 --> 00:05:23,879
You got the cups in the front...</i>

117
00:05:24,049 --> 00:05:26,609
...two loops in the back, all right?</i>

118
00:05:26,769 --> 00:05:30,205
- I guess that's about it.
- I got it. Cups in front, loops in back.</i>

119
00:05:30,369 --> 00:05:32,678
You got ketchup on it.</i>

120
00:05:38,929 --> 00:05:40,806
Sniffing? What do you mean,
sniffing?</i>

121
00:05:40,969 --> 00:05:43,961
- Sniffing. With his nose.
- Jerry, he probably had a cold.</i>

122
00:05:44,129 --> 00:05:46,962
- No, he didn't. I asked him.
- So, what are you saying?</i>

123
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:50,201
- I don't know. You know, what if...?
- Drugs?

124
00:05:50,369 --> 00:05:52,485
- You think he's on drugs?
- I don't know.</i>

125
00:05:52,649 --> 00:05:54,287
- Jerry-
- All I know is he was sniffing.</i>

126
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:56,519
- Listen, we went in on a CD together.
- I know.</i>

127
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,088
And Newman gave you money too.</i>

128
00:05:58,249 --> 00:06:00,717
See, I didn't even meet this guy.
We trusted you.</i>

129
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:03,039
Look, it doesn't necessarily
mean anything yet.</i>

130
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:05,962
- It just means he was sniffing.
- Well, what else? Was he nervous?</i>

131
00:06:06,129 --> 00:06:09,758
Did he use a lot of slang?
Did he use the word "man"?</i>

132
00:06:11,769 --> 00:06:13,088
No, he didn't use "man."</i>

133
00:06:13,249 --> 00:06:16,161
I mean, when he was leaving,
did he say, "I'm splitting"?</i>

134
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:19,364
No, but at one point,
he did use the bathroom.</i>

135
00:06:23,409 --> 00:06:25,969
- You think that's a bad sign?
- Yes, that's what they do.</i>

136
00:06:26,129 --> 00:06:27,528
They live in the bathroom.</i>

137
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:30,044
What are we gonna do?
We're gonna get our money, right?</i>

138
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:32,040
I don't know.
This sweater really itches me.</i>

139
00:06:32,209 --> 00:06:33,881
- You want it?
- Yeah.</i>

140
00:06:38,369 --> 00:06:40,929
Hello. Hel-</i>

141
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:43,721
Well, you notice anything?</i>

142
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:46,357
You have cleaned up
the whole apartment...</i>

143
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:48,360
...and you're making dinner.
You're perfect.</i>

144
00:06:48,529 --> 00:06:50,997
You're a perfect man.</i>

145
00:06:55,329 --> 00:06:57,206
- Did anyone call?
- You got a few messages.</i>

146
00:06:57,369 --> 00:06:59,087
- I wrote them down.
- Where are they?</i>

147
00:06:59,249 --> 00:07:02,559
Let's see, they are...
Here they are.</i>

148
00:07:02,729 --> 00:07:04,560
Thank you.

149
00:07:04,729 --> 00:07:07,289
Oh, yeah. I'll call you back.</i>

150
00:07:08,649 --> 00:07:11,402
Forget that-
Myra had the baby!</i>

151
00:07:11,569 --> 00:07:13,161
Oh, my God. That's wonderful.</i>

152
00:07:13,329 --> 00:07:14,603
- Who called?
- She did.</i>

153
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:16,999
She did? Oh, that's so great.</i>

154
00:07:17,409 --> 00:07:20,526
- Where do you keep the corkscrew?
- It's in the drawer on the right.</i>

155
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:25,882
What?

156
00:07:26,089 --> 00:07:27,568
No, it's nothing.

157
00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:29,879
- No, what is it?
- It's nothing.

158
00:07:30,129 --> 00:07:31,562
Tell me.</i>

159
00:07:32,089 --> 00:07:36,480
Well, I was just curious why you
didn't use an exclamation point.</i>

160
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:40,043
What are you talking about?</i>

161
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:42,439
Well, see right here? You wrote,
"Myra had the baby."</i>

162
00:07:42,609 --> 00:07:45,328
But you didn't use
an exclamation point.</i>

163
00:07:45,489 --> 00:07:47,002
So?

164
00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:49,558
So it's- Yeah, it's nothing.
Forget it. Forget it.</i>

165
00:07:49,729 --> 00:07:51,606
You know, I just found it curious.

166
00:07:51,769 --> 00:07:54,329
Wait, what's so curious about it?

167
00:07:54,489 --> 00:07:58,277
Well, I mean, if one of your
close friends had a baby...</i>

168
00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:01,566
...and I left you a message about it,
I would use an exclamation point.</i>

169
00:08:01,729 --> 00:08:03,765
Well, maybe I don't use
my exclamation points...</i>

170
00:08:03,929 --> 00:08:05,965
...as haphazardly as you do.

171
00:08:06,929 --> 00:08:09,489
You don't think
that someone having a baby...</i>

172
00:08:09,649 --> 00:08:11,401
...warrants an exclamation point?</i>

173
00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:13,446
Hey, look, I just jotted down
the message.</i>

174
00:08:13,609 --> 00:08:16,840
I didn't know that I was required
to capture the mood of each caller.</i>

175
00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:21,208
Well, I just thought you'd be a little
more excited about a friend of mine...</i>

176
00:08:21,369 --> 00:08:23,246
- ... having a baby.
- Okay, I'm excited.</i>

177
00:08:23,409 --> 00:08:25,639
I just don't happen to like
exclamation points.</i>

178
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:27,720
Well, Jake, you should
learn to use them.</i>

179
00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:30,642
Like, the way I'm talking now,
I'd put exclamation points...</i>

180
00:08:30,809 --> 00:08:34,165
...on the ends all of these sentences!
On this one! And on that one!</i>

181
00:08:34,329 --> 00:08:36,559
Well, you can put one on this one:</i>

182
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:38,208
I'm leaving!</i>

183
00:08:43,369 --> 00:08:45,087
- You're out of your mind.
- Why?</i>

184
00:08:45,249 --> 00:08:47,080
It's an exclamation point.</i>

185
00:08:47,249 --> 00:08:50,764
- It's a line with a dot under it.
- Well, I felt it called for one.</i>

186
00:08:50,929 --> 00:08:53,124
"Called for one."I thought
I'd heard of everything.</i>

187
00:08:53,289 --> 00:08:56,167
I never heard of a relationship
being affected by punctuation.</i>

188
00:08:56,329 --> 00:08:58,889
I found it very troubling
that he didn't use one.</i>

189
00:09:00,129 --> 00:09:02,689
George is right.
Didn't take you long.</i>

190
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:07,960
Anything new with that guy
on drugs?</i>

191
00:09:08,369 --> 00:09:09,927
He's not on drugs.</i>

192
00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:13,968
Then why the sniffing?
Who walks around... sniffing?</i>

193
00:09:14,129 --> 00:09:16,165
All right, here.
You call him right now, okay?</i>

194
00:09:16,329 --> 00:09:19,401
- See if he's sniffing right now.
- Good idea.</i>

195
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,448
- Prophet and Goldstein.
- Yes, Barry Prophet, please.</i>

196
00:09:26,609 --> 00:09:28,361
I'm sorry, he's out of town
this week.</i>

197
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:30,997
- Out of town?
- Yes. He went to South America.</i>

198
00:09:31,169 --> 00:09:33,558
- South America?
- South America?</i>

199
00:09:33,729 --> 00:09:35,321
I'll call back. Thank you.

200
00:09:35,489 --> 00:09:38,447
- He went to South America.
- Yeah!</i>

201
00:09:39,409 --> 00:09:40,762
So what?

202
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:44,843
- Who goes to South America?
- People go to South America.</i>

203
00:09:45,009 --> 00:09:48,160
Yeah, and they come back with
things taped to their large intestine.</i>

204
00:09:49,009 --> 00:09:50,681
So because of a few bad apples...</i>

205
00:09:50,849 --> 00:09:52,965
...you're gonna impugn
an entire continent?</i>

206
00:09:53,129 --> 00:09:54,926
Yes, I'm impugning a continent.</i>

207
00:09:55,089 --> 00:09:57,398
Well, I say we go and get
our money right now.</i>

208
00:09:57,849 --> 00:10:00,602
- Hey. Hey.
- Hello, Newman.</i>

209
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:02,680
Hello, Jerry.</i>

210
00:10:03,009 --> 00:10:04,328
So any news?</i>

211
00:10:04,489 --> 00:10:06,559
Yeah, he skipped out
and... went to South America.</i>

212
00:10:06,729 --> 00:10:07,878
South America?!</i>

213
00:10:08,049 --> 00:10:11,200
What kind of snow blower
did you get us mixed up with?</i>

214
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:15,278
Okay, gentlemen, the fact remains
you still have no proof.</i>

215
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:17,644
This is all speculation and hearsay.</i>

216
00:10:17,809 --> 00:10:20,960
Wait. There's one way to find out.
We set up a sting.</i>

217
00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:25,198
You know, like Abscam.
Like Abscam, Jerry.</i>

218
00:10:25,809 --> 00:10:26,958
What are you gonna do?</i>

219
00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:30,405
You gonna put on phoney beards
and dress up like Arab sheiks...</i>

220
00:10:30,569 --> 00:10:32,241
...and sit around
in some hotel room?</i>

221
00:10:32,409 --> 00:10:34,718
- I mean, come on.
- Wait a second.</i>

222
00:10:34,889 --> 00:10:36,959
Maybe there is a way to tempt him
and find out.</i>

223
00:10:37,129 --> 00:10:41,008
If we put our three heads together,
we should come up with something.</i>

224
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:52,688
- What's today?
- It's Thursday.

225
00:10:52,849 --> 00:10:54,202
Really?</i>

226
00:10:54,369 --> 00:10:56,360
Feels like Tuesday.</i>

227
00:10:57,009 --> 00:10:58,806
Tuesday has no feel.</i>

228
00:10:58,969 --> 00:11:01,039
Monday has a feel.</i>

229
00:11:01,249 --> 00:11:02,887
Friday has a feel.</i>

230
00:11:03,049 --> 00:11:04,198
Sunday has a feel.</i>

231
00:11:04,369 --> 00:11:07,088
- I feel Tuesday and Wednesday.
- Shut up, the both of you.</i>

232
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:08,523
You're making me nervous.</i>

233
00:11:09,609 --> 00:11:12,362
Where is he already? He should've
been out of work by now.</i>

234
00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:13,882
Hey, this is kind of fun.</i>

235
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:16,643
Yeah. Maybe we ought to become
private detectives.</i>

236
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:18,128
Yeah, maybe you should.</i>

237
00:11:18,289 --> 00:11:21,247
- Maybe I will.
- Yeah, me too.</i>

238
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:23,401
All right, what are you
gonna say to him?</i>

239
00:11:23,569 --> 00:11:25,799
Just gonna find out
if he's interested.</i>

240
00:11:25,969 --> 00:11:27,561
Hey, maybe I should go in with him.</i>

241
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,685
- No, you stay in the car.
- Who made you leader?</i>

242
00:11:29,849 --> 00:11:33,205
All right, Newman. One more peep
out of you, you're out of the operation.</i>

243
00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:37,323
There he is.
He's going into that bar.</i>

244
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,007
All right...

245
00:11:41,809 --> 00:11:43,800
- ... I'm going in.
- Be careful, Kramer.</i>

246
00:11:47,049 --> 00:11:48,277
I should've gone in with him.</i>

247
00:11:48,449 --> 00:11:50,440
No, you stay here in the car.
I may need you.</i>

248
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:52,042
What do you need me
in the car for?</i>

249
00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:54,643
I might need you to get me a soda.</i>

250
00:12:04,049 --> 00:12:06,244
I'll have a brewski, Charlie.</i>

251
00:12:06,409 --> 00:12:08,206
The name's Mitch.</i>

252
00:12:08,369 --> 00:12:10,929
Well, there's nothing like a cold one
after a long day, huh?</i>

253
00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:12,841
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.</i>

254
00:12:13,009 --> 00:12:15,967
Yeah, I've been known to drink
a beer or two.</i>

255
00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:19,360
But then again, I've been known
to do a lot of things.</i>

256
00:12:31,129 --> 00:12:32,960
- Cigarette?
- No, no. I never touch them.</i>

257
00:12:33,329 --> 00:12:34,523
Well...</i>

258
00:12:34,689 --> 00:12:37,647
...I suck them down like Coca-Cola.</i>

259
00:12:39,489 --> 00:12:40,683
Well...</i>

260
00:12:40,849 --> 00:12:43,647
...here's to feeling good
all the time, huh?</i>

261
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:03,686
Looks like you got yourself
a little cold there, huh, fella?</i>

262
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:06,761
- I don't think so.
- Me neither.</i>

263
00:13:13,809 --> 00:13:16,448
You should try this new
dental floss, Glide. It's fantastic.</i>

264
00:13:16,609 --> 00:13:18,759
- I use Dentotape.
- You should try this.</i>

265
00:13:19,609 --> 00:13:21,804
- I don't wanna.
- Not even once?</i>

266
00:13:22,289 --> 00:13:25,406
- No.
- You know, you're an idiot.</i>

267
00:13:25,569 --> 00:13:27,048
Why, because I use Dentotape?</i>

268
00:13:27,209 --> 00:13:30,724
Right. Anyone who uses Dentotape
is an idiot.</i>

269
00:13:31,129 --> 00:13:32,847
- South America, huh?
- Yeah, yeah.</i>

270
00:13:33,009 --> 00:13:34,328
That's a burgeoning continent.</i>

271
00:13:34,489 --> 00:13:37,162
Well, they are expanding
their economic base, yeah.</i>

272
00:13:37,329 --> 00:13:38,557
Tell me about it.</i>

273
00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:40,840
Excuse me, I gotta go
to the bathroom.</i>

274
00:13:41,009 --> 00:13:42,442
I'm hip.

275
00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:47,758
- Hip to what?
- To the whole scene.</i>

276
00:13:48,689 --> 00:13:51,681
- What scene?
- The bathroom scene.</i>

277
00:13:53,449 --> 00:13:55,917
Listen, don't take this personally,
but when I come back...</i>

278
00:13:56,089 --> 00:13:59,206
- ... I'm sitting over there.
- Whatever turns you on.</i>

279
00:14:04,209 --> 00:14:06,962
- No, no, I don't like it.
- What do you mean, you don't like it?</i>

280
00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:10,007
- How could you not like it?
- I like the thick tape.</i>

281
00:14:32,209 --> 00:14:35,246
Hey. What kind of nut are you?</i>

282
00:14:38,009 --> 00:14:42,241
So basically, George,
the job here is quite simple.</i>

283
00:14:42,409 --> 00:14:44,047
Selling bras.</i>

284
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:46,928
That interests me very much,
Mr. Farkus. Very much indeed, sir.</i>

285
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:49,000
Have you ever sold
a woman's line before?</i>

286
00:14:49,169 --> 00:14:51,160
No, but...

287
00:14:51,329 --> 00:14:53,718
...I have a very good rapport
with women.</i>

288
00:14:53,889 --> 00:14:55,641
Very good. Comfortable.</i>

289
00:14:55,809 --> 00:14:59,848
And from the first time I laid eyes
on a brassiere...</i>

290
00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:01,567
...I was enthralled.</i>

291
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,327
Tell me about it.</i>

292
00:15:05,809 --> 00:15:08,243
Well, I was 14 years old...</i>

293
00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:10,604
...I was in my friend's bathroom...</i>

294
00:15:10,769 --> 00:15:14,478
...his mother's brassiere
was hanging over the shower rod.</i>

295
00:15:14,729 --> 00:15:16,208
I picked it up.</i>

296
00:15:16,369 --> 00:15:18,166
I studied it.</i>

297
00:15:18,529 --> 00:15:20,042
I thought:

298
00:15:20,209 --> 00:15:21,403
"I like this."</i>

299
00:15:21,569 --> 00:15:24,959
I didn't know in what way
or on what level, but I knew...</i>

300
00:15:25,129 --> 00:15:27,518
...I wanted to be around brassieres.</i>

301
00:15:27,689 --> 00:15:30,249
That's an incredible story.</i>

302
00:15:30,969 --> 00:15:34,518
You have a remarkable passion
for brassieres.</i>

303
00:15:34,689 --> 00:15:37,761
Well, they're more than just
underwear to me, Mr. Farkus.</i>

304
00:15:38,249 --> 00:15:39,967
Two cups in the front...</i>

305
00:15:40,129 --> 00:15:42,120
...two loops in the back...</i>

306
00:15:42,369 --> 00:15:43,404
...how do they do it?</i>

307
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:45,761
Well, I think I can say...</i>

308
00:15:45,929 --> 00:15:47,885
...barring some
unforeseen incident...</i>

309
00:15:48,049 --> 00:15:51,200
...that you will have a very bright
future here at E.D. Granmont.</i>

310
00:15:51,969 --> 00:15:54,437
Thank you, Mr. Farkus.
Thank you very much indeed, sir.</i>

311
00:15:54,609 --> 00:15:55,962
See you Monday, 9:00.</i>

312
00:15:56,569 --> 00:15:58,241
If you don't mind, sir...

313
00:15:58,409 --> 00:16:00,001
...I'll be here at 8.</i>

314
00:16:00,329 --> 00:16:01,808
Excellent.</i>

315
00:16:02,089 --> 00:16:04,080
So long, Mr. Farkus.

316
00:16:14,609 --> 00:16:17,328
- What do you think you're doing?
- Nothing. What?</i>

317
00:16:17,489 --> 00:16:18,922
Farkus, get out here.</i>

318
00:16:19,409 --> 00:16:21,320
Oh, yes, Ms. De Granmont?</i>

319
00:16:21,489 --> 00:16:22,717
Farkus...

320
00:16:22,889 --> 00:16:25,005
...who is this perverted little weasel?</i>

321
00:16:25,169 --> 00:16:27,729
This is Costanza,
he's our new bra salesman.</i>

322
00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:29,641
He's supposed to start on Monday.</i>

323
00:16:30,049 --> 00:16:32,199
If he's here on Monday, you're not.</i>

324
00:16:32,369 --> 00:16:33,961
Take your pick.</i>

325
00:16:34,929 --> 00:16:38,239
Get out. I'm terribly sorry,
Ms. De Granmont.</i>

326
00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:41,401
You wanted to see me,
Mr. Lippman?</i>

327
00:16:41,569 --> 00:16:45,687
I was just going over
the Jake Jarmel book...</i>

328
00:16:45,849 --> 00:16:48,841
...and I understand you worked
with him very closely on this.</i>

329
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:51,045
Yes- Yes, I did.</i>

330
00:16:51,209 --> 00:16:54,087
And anyway, I was just reading
your final edit...</i>

331
00:16:54,249 --> 00:16:59,642
...and there seems to be an inordinate
number of exclamation points.</i>

332
00:17:00,049 --> 00:17:06,079
Well, I- I felt that the writing lacked
a certain emotion and intensity.</i>

333
00:17:06,249 --> 00:17:07,523
You know, it's...</i>

334
00:17:07,689 --> 00:17:12,763
"It was a damp and chilly afternoon,
so I decided to put on my sweatshirt!"</i>

335
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:14,523
Right. Well-</i>

336
00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:16,805
You put an exclamation point
after "sweatshirt."</i>

337
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:21,167
That's correct. I felt that the character
doesn't like to be chilly.</i>

338
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:22,478
I see.</i>

339
00:17:22,649 --> 00:17:25,959
"I pulled the lever on the machine,
but the Clark bar didn't come out!"</i>

340
00:17:26,769 --> 00:17:28,521
- Again, exclamation point.
- Yeah.</i>

341
00:17:28,689 --> 00:17:30,600
Well, you know how frustrating
that can be...</i>

342
00:17:30,769 --> 00:17:33,488
...when you keep putting quarters
and quarters into a machine...</i>

343
00:17:33,649 --> 00:17:36,925
- ... and... nothing comes out.
- Get rid of the exclamation points.</i>

344
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:38,886
- Okay, I will.
- I hate exclamation points.</i>

345
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:40,528
Okay.

346
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:43,406
Just- I'll-

347
00:17:44,729 --> 00:17:46,321
"Dear Barry, consider this letter...</i>

348
00:17:46,489 --> 00:17:49,242
...the termination of our relationship,
effective immediately."</i>

349
00:17:49,409 --> 00:17:51,206
- Exclamation point.
- Right.

350
00:17:52,449 --> 00:17:54,087
You still have no proof.</i>

351
00:17:54,249 --> 00:17:56,285
Elaine, he was sniffing like crazy
around me.</i>

352
00:17:56,449 --> 00:17:59,009
"I will expect all funds in the form
of a cashier's check...</i>

353
00:17:59,169 --> 00:18:00,602
...no later than the 18th."</i>

354
00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:03,078
Double exclamation point.</i>

355
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:05,487
- Will that take care of ours too?
- Yep.</i>

356
00:18:05,649 --> 00:18:07,879
I'll give you yours as soon as
I get my money back.</i>

357
00:18:08,049 --> 00:18:09,641
Want me to mail it?
I'm on my way out.</i>

358
00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:13,085
- Yeah, thanks.
- All right. Be my pleasure.</i>

359
00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:18,926
See you later.</i>

360
00:18:19,689 --> 00:18:21,486
You know, this is-

361
00:18:22,529 --> 00:18:24,520
- Hey, Ralph.
- What's up, fellas?</i>

362
00:18:24,689 --> 00:18:26,520
- That'll be 14.30.
- All right.</i>

363
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:29,283
- Mushrooms? You got mushrooms.
- Yeah.</i>

364
00:18:30,169 --> 00:18:32,888
- What's the matter, you got a cold?
- No, man.</i>

365
00:18:33,049 --> 00:18:35,483
- Kramer, what is this?
- It's a sweater.</i>

366
00:18:35,649 --> 00:18:38,288
- What is it made out of?
- I don't know. Jerry gave it to me.</i>

367
00:18:38,449 --> 00:18:40,838
- It's mohair, I think.
- Mohair. That figures.</i>

368
00:18:41,009 --> 00:18:42,567
I'm allergic to mohair.</i>

369
00:18:42,729 --> 00:18:45,004
- You mean, you just started sniffing?
- Yeah.</i>

370
00:18:45,169 --> 00:18:46,727
Mohair does it to me every time.</i>

371
00:18:48,489 --> 00:18:51,242
I was wearing that sweater in the
coffee shop when Barry came in.</i>

372
00:18:51,409 --> 00:18:55,243
- Jerry, I was wearing it in the bar.
- The sweater made him sniff.</i>

373
00:18:55,409 --> 00:18:57,798
See? I told you he wasn't
a drug addict.</i>

374
00:18:57,969 --> 00:18:59,118
Oh, no, the letter.</i>

375
00:18:59,289 --> 00:19:02,440
Newman- It's got
exclamation points all over it.</i>

376
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:05,407
Not to mention the picture of him
on the toilet.</i>

377
00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:10,683
The what?</i>

378
00:19:20,849 --> 00:19:22,999
- After you.
- Thank you.</i>

379
00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:26,841
Get your hands off of me!</i>

380
00:19:27,129 --> 00:19:29,723
Johnny! Johnny!

381
00:19:34,929 --> 00:19:36,681
What do you mean,
you felt her material?</i>

382
00:19:36,849 --> 00:19:38,362
What? With your fingers, like this?</i>

383
00:19:38,529 --> 00:19:40,679
So what? What's so bad about that?

384
00:19:40,849 --> 00:19:43,409
Who goes around
feeling people's material?</i>

385
00:19:43,569 --> 00:19:46,925
What can be gained
by feeling a person's material?</i>

386
00:19:47,089 --> 00:19:48,363
It's insanity.

387
00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:51,168
Whatever happened to, "My,
that's a lovely dress you have on.</i>

388
00:19:51,329 --> 00:19:52,523
May I have this dance?"</i>

389
00:19:58,609 --> 00:20:01,919
You know, you are really lucky
Newman never mailed that letter.</i>

390
00:20:02,689 --> 00:20:05,601
Sorry I'm late. I just came from
a meeting with my lawyer.</i>

391
00:20:05,769 --> 00:20:07,248
- Hey.
- What is this?</i>

392
00:20:07,409 --> 00:20:11,038
It's a letter from your friend
Barry Prophet's lawyer.</i>

393
00:20:11,889 --> 00:20:13,880
He's filing Chapter 11?</i>

394
00:20:14,049 --> 00:20:16,040
What's going on?
Why is he filing Chapter 11?</i>

395
00:20:16,209 --> 00:20:17,483
Bankruptcy.

396
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:20,527
Bankruptcy. As in, "I've taken
your money and spent it on drugs."</i>

397
00:20:21,449 --> 00:20:23,201
What? I thought it was the sweater.</i>

398
00:20:23,369 --> 00:20:25,325
- What about the money?
- What about the money?</i>

399
00:20:25,489 --> 00:20:27,445
If I had dissolved my relationship
with him...</i>

400
00:20:27,609 --> 00:20:30,521
...prior to his filing Chapter 11,
I could've got the money back.</i>

401
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:31,883
Which I would've done...</i>

402
00:20:32,049 --> 00:20:35,883
...if a certain imbecile had been able
to get to a mailbox and mail a letter.</i>

403
00:20:41,489 --> 00:20:43,366
Pair of bear claws, please.</i>

404
00:20:49,729 --> 00:20:51,162
Nice.</i>

405
00:20:51,329 --> 00:20:53,160
- Think so?
- Yeah, what is it?</i>

406
00:20:53,489 --> 00:20:55,366
Half silk, half cotton, half linen.</i>

407
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:59,559
How can you go wrong?

408
00:21:07,569 --> 00:21:09,958
My accountant actually did...

409
00:21:10,129 --> 00:21:13,246
...take a big chunk of money from me
and use it to buy drugs.</i>

410
00:21:13,409 --> 00:21:16,048
The thing that was hardest for me
to comprehend about this...</i>

411
00:21:16,209 --> 00:21:20,521
...is the life choice of drug abuse
and accounting.</i>

412
00:21:21,689 --> 00:21:24,157
It makes sense. Why would
an athlete or musician take drugs?</i>

413
00:21:24,329 --> 00:21:25,648
They have an interesting job.</i>

414
00:21:25,809 --> 00:21:29,279
But an accountant? If ever a job
required hallucinogenic support...</i>

415
00:21:29,449 --> 00:21:31,087
...this is the job.</i>

416
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:33,479
That should be the legal defence.</i>

417
00:21:33,649 --> 00:21:36,209
"You're charged with
possession of illegal narcotics."</i>

418
00:21:36,369 --> 00:21:39,202
"But, Your Honour,
I'm an accountant."

419
00:21:39,889 --> 00:21:41,083
Bang."Case closed.</i>

420
00:21:41,249 --> 00:21:44,605
Bailiff, give this man his peyote
and tequila back for the drive home.</i>

421
00:21:44,769 --> 00:21:47,078
Sorry to bother you, sir.
Terribly sorry."</i>

422
