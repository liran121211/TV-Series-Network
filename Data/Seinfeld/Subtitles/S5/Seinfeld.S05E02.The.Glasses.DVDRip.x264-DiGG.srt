1
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:07,399
I stay up late. I'm "night guy."
Night guy wants to stay up late.</i>

2
00:00:07,569 --> 00:00:11,039
"Getting up after five hours' sleep?"
"That's morning guy's problem.</i>

3
00:00:11,209 --> 00:00:13,643
That's not my problem.
I'm night guy.</i>

4
00:00:13,809 --> 00:00:15,083
I stay up as late as I want."</i>

5
00:00:15,249 --> 00:00:18,082
So you get up in the morning,
you're exhausted, groggy.</i>

6
00:00:18,249 --> 00:00:20,046
"Oh, I hate that night guy!"</i>

7
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:23,649
See, night guy always screws
morning guy.</i>

8
00:00:23,809 --> 00:00:25,879
There's nothing morning guy can do.</i>

9
00:00:26,049 --> 00:00:28,199
The only thing morning guy can do
is oversleep...</i>

10
00:00:28,369 --> 00:00:32,521
...so that day guy loses his job
and night guy has no money to go out.</i>

11
00:00:38,769 --> 00:00:40,600
Do you ever spit
on anybody from here?</i>

12
00:00:40,769 --> 00:00:42,202
No. You?

13
00:00:42,369 --> 00:00:44,087
No.

14
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:46,606
- Do you ever think about it?
- Yeah.</i>

15
00:00:46,769 --> 00:00:48,361
Me too.</i>

16
00:00:49,889 --> 00:00:52,039
- Hey.
- Hey.</i>

17
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:55,199
- Well, I got it.
- You got me the air conditioner?</i>

18
00:00:55,369 --> 00:00:56,848
- What do you think?
- Beautiful.</i>

19
00:00:57,009 --> 00:00:58,124
What air conditioner?</i>

20
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:01,406
My buddy works in an appliance
store. He got us 30 percent off.</i>

21
00:01:01,569 --> 00:01:04,800
- Is it a good one?
- Good one? It's a Commando 8.</i>

22
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:07,642
- Commando 8?
- Twelve thousand BTUs.</i>

23
00:01:07,809 --> 00:01:10,607
You hate air conditioning.
You've never had an air conditioner.</i>

24
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:15,047
- But Amy likes air conditioning.
- Oh, an air conditioner for Amy.</i>

25
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:20,283
Amy doesn't like the temperature
up here. She's a little hot.</i>

26
00:01:20,449 --> 00:01:23,043
- All right.
- Okay. So...</i>

27
00:01:23,209 --> 00:01:25,245
- I'm gonna measure the window up.
- Yeah.</i>

28
00:01:28,329 --> 00:01:30,763
Yeah. Rock on!</i>

29
00:01:32,769 --> 00:01:34,919
I gotta get out of this city.</i>

30
00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:37,877
So you're tunnelling
to the centre of the Earth?</i>

31
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:41,563
I'm at the health club.</i>

32
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:45,005
And while I'm in the pool,
some guy walks off with my glasses.</i>

33
00:01:45,169 --> 00:01:48,525
Who steals prescription glasses?</i>

34
00:01:50,609 --> 00:01:54,318
- You don't have an old pair?
- I broke them playing basketball.</i>

35
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:57,003
He was running from a bee.</i>

36
00:01:59,129 --> 00:02:01,768
Now if I wanna see anything,
I gotta wear these.</i>

37
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:04,848
George, those are prescription
goggles?</i>

38
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:07,400
What is there to see
in a health club pool?</i>

39
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:09,241
There's a lot of change down there.</i>

40
00:02:09,409 --> 00:02:11,525
When I find that guy,
this much I vow:</i>

41
00:02:11,689 --> 00:02:14,920
Those glasses will be returned
to their rightful owner.</i>

42
00:02:15,089 --> 00:02:18,081
We're behind you, Aquaboy.
Godspeed.</i>

43
00:02:18,849 --> 00:02:21,807
What kind of a sick, demented person
wants another person's glasses?</i>

44
00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:24,358
Yeah, especially those frames.</i>

45
00:02:25,169 --> 00:02:28,764
You know what you ought to do?
Go see Dwayne at J&T Optical.</i>

46
00:02:28,929 --> 00:02:30,123
He'll give you 30 percent off.</i>

47
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:31,483
Yeah. Come on.</i>

48
00:02:31,649 --> 00:02:34,527
Hey, he just got me 30 percent off
on an air conditioner.</i>

49
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:37,567
- Really?
- Retail is for suckers.</i>

50
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:41,445
- What do I have to do?
- Just mention my name.</i>

51
00:02:41,609 --> 00:02:43,565
- That's it?
- That's it.

52
00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:51,081
What about these?</i>

53
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:53,480
They look good.
I liked the other one too.</i>

54
00:02:53,649 --> 00:02:55,799
I've liked about five of them.</i>

55
00:02:55,969 --> 00:02:59,279
Well, it's a tough decision.
I have to wear these every day.</i>

56
00:02:59,449 --> 00:03:01,804
- I'm deciding on a new face.
- Come on, George.</i>

57
00:03:01,969 --> 00:03:03,880
Pick a face and go with it.</i>

58
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:07,958
Now, those look good.
They're very bold.</i>

59
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:11,120
Yes, they are bold.</i>

60
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:13,968
Jerry, what do you think?</i>

61
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:17,201
These women would be good-looking
if they weren't wearing glasses.</i>

62
00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:19,997
Hi there, little doggy.</i>

63
00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:22,603
- Do you mind if I pet your dog?
- It's okay with me.</i>

64
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,327
Hi, little doggy.</i>

65
00:03:24,969 --> 00:03:26,368
You can't have that dog in here.</i>

66
00:03:26,529 --> 00:03:30,158
- You okay? Did he bite you?
- Can you believe that guy?</i>

67
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:32,001
I'm okay. It's just a nip.

68
00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:34,046
He just walked away.</i>

69
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:37,645
And once again I'm standing here
like a little man.</i>

70
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:40,726
Well, not this time.</i>

71
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,964
You! Dog man!

72
00:03:50,529 --> 00:03:53,680
- My leg looks pretty bad.
- I'll take you to the emergency room.</i>

73
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:56,522
- Okay.
- Hey. Any luck? Did you catch him?</i>

74
00:03:57,449 --> 00:03:58,802
No. No.

75
00:03:58,969 --> 00:04:01,767
- I'll take Elaine to the hospital.
- Good, good. Do that.</i>

76
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:05,567
- What's the matter?
- Oh, no. Nothing.</i>

77
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:07,162
What is it?

78
00:04:07,689 --> 00:04:08,838
I can't tell you.</i>

79
00:04:09,529 --> 00:04:11,884
- Jerry, can we go?
- Yeah, yeah. In a second.</i>

80
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:14,244
- You can't tell me?
- I can't tell you.</i>

81
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:15,728
- Don't ask.
- I'm asking.

82
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:19,279
- Jerry, my leg.
- Yeah, here. Take care of it.</i>

83
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:21,801
Come on, George. What is it?</i>

84
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:25,962
I saw Amy making out
with your cousin Jeffrey.</i>

85
00:04:26,929 --> 00:04:28,760
- What?
- They were right outside.</i>

86
00:04:29,249 --> 00:04:31,809
- Amy and Jeffrey?
- Yes.</i>

87
00:04:32,409 --> 00:04:34,286
- Are you sure?
- Yes. Positive.</i>

88
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:37,327
But you can't see.
There's no lenses in those frames.</i>

89
00:04:38,609 --> 00:04:41,407
I know. I was squinting.

90
00:04:41,569 --> 00:04:45,801
Jerry, you just catch up with me.
You can just follow the trail of blood.</i>

91
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:49,004
We're gonna have to
talk about this later.</i>

92
00:04:50,529 --> 00:04:52,201
Thank you.

93
00:04:52,969 --> 00:04:54,607
Taxi!

94
00:04:57,689 --> 00:05:00,044
Excuse me.
What do you think of these?</i>

95
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:03,566
We just got those in.
It's a very exciting new frame.</i>

96
00:05:04,769 --> 00:05:07,078
Yes, it is exciting.</i>

97
00:05:07,249 --> 00:05:08,682
This is gonna be my new face.</i>

98
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:11,682
- Do you have a prescription?
- Yeah.</i>

99
00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:17,367
Kramer.</i>

100
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:22,323
What?

101
00:05:22,969 --> 00:05:24,197
Kramer.</i>

102
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:29,485
- What about him?
- You do know Kramer.</i>

103
00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:33,964
- Yes.
- Well, I'm mentioning his name.</i>

104
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:38,087
Why?

105
00:05:38,329 --> 00:05:40,285
Because, you know...</i>

106
00:05:40,929 --> 00:05:43,727
No, I don't know. Look,
I'm gonna need a deposit on these.</i>

107
00:05:48,769 --> 00:05:50,839
Oh, come on. Cousin Jeffrey?</i>

108
00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:53,318
- It's not possible.
- Why not? They could've met.</i>

109
00:05:53,489 --> 00:05:55,798
She loves the park.
He works for the Parks Department.</i>

110
00:05:57,969 --> 00:05:59,641
Jerry, that is so ridiculous.</i>

111
00:05:59,809 --> 00:06:02,039
George didn't even have
his glasses on.</i>

112
00:06:02,209 --> 00:06:03,688
But he was squinting.</i>

113
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:07,603
So what? Squinting doesn't make
that much of a difference.</i>

114
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:09,919
Are you kidding?
I've seen him squint.</i>

115
00:06:10,089 --> 00:06:13,240
He can squint his way
down to like 20-30 vision.</i>

116
00:06:14,409 --> 00:06:17,162
Once we drove down from the
Catskills and he lost his glasses.</i>

117
00:06:17,329 --> 00:06:21,288
He squinted his way from Wurtsboro
down to the Tappan Zee Bridge.</i>

118
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:23,838
He was spotting raccoons
on the road.</i>

119
00:06:26,529 --> 00:06:28,406
- Okay.
- Okay?

120
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:30,525
That's it?
I don't need a shot?</i>

121
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:33,283
No shot. Dog bite.</i>

122
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:36,685
No, I know I wasn't shot.

123
00:06:36,849 --> 00:06:38,362
Do I need a shot?</i>

124
00:06:38,529 --> 00:06:40,963
Not shot. Dog bite.</i>

125
00:06:41,809 --> 00:06:43,800
Woof-woof. Not bang-bang.

126
00:06:50,729 --> 00:06:53,084
- Look at this. The cable's out.
- That's okay.</i>

127
00:06:53,249 --> 00:06:56,480
- We don't have to watch TV.
- No, no. No trouble at all.</i>

128
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:59,083
It's the principle of the thing.</i>

129
00:07:00,409 --> 00:07:03,560
I like them to know that I know
what's going on...</i>

130
00:07:03,729 --> 00:07:08,041
...that they're not getting away
with anything.</i>

131
00:07:09,249 --> 00:07:10,887
I'm on hold.

132
00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:13,648
So, what did you do yesterday?</i>

133
00:07:14,089 --> 00:07:16,239
- Yesterday?
- Yeah.</i>

134
00:07:16,409 --> 00:07:18,604
You remember yesterday.</i>

135
00:07:18,769 --> 00:07:21,806
Beautiful day.
Good day to be out.</i>

136
00:07:22,489 --> 00:07:26,402
- I didn't do anything.
- Well, you must've done something.</i>

137
00:07:29,209 --> 00:07:32,360
- No. Nothing really.
- Didn't go out of the house?</i>

138
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:38,362
Didn't take a walk
on Columbus Avenue?</i>

139
00:07:38,529 --> 00:07:40,485
- Well, I did go out for a little while.
- Well.</i>

140
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:43,641
Your day's getting
more interesting already.</i>

141
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:46,408
Oh, see?</i>

142
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:50,278
Told me they'd be back in a minute,
and they lied.</i>

143
00:07:52,489 --> 00:07:55,162
- You can't trust anyone.
- No, you can't.</i>

144
00:07:55,329 --> 00:07:57,160
Well, let's cut the bull, sister!</i>

145
00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:01,087
I know about you swapping spit
with somebody on Columbus.</i>

146
00:08:01,249 --> 00:08:03,968
- What are you talking about?
- Look, my friend saw you.</i>

147
00:08:04,129 --> 00:08:05,403
Saw me? With who?</i>

148
00:08:05,969 --> 00:08:07,288
You tell me.</i>

149
00:08:08,369 --> 00:08:09,882
There's nothing to tell.</i>

150
00:08:11,529 --> 00:08:13,281
There isn't?</i>

151
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:14,928
No.

152
00:08:17,929 --> 00:08:19,760
All right.

153
00:08:19,929 --> 00:08:21,487
Wanna get some pizza?</i>

154
00:08:24,369 --> 00:08:26,280
I had a feeling this was
too good to be true.</i>

155
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:28,565
- Why?
- There had to be another side to you.</i>

156
00:08:28,729 --> 00:08:32,199
- No, there's no side.
- There is a side, an ugly side.</i>

157
00:08:32,369 --> 00:08:34,439
No, no ugly side.</i>

158
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:36,926
- Look, I think I'm gonna go.
- Why?

159
00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:41,002
- It's really hot in here.
- So we can still go out on Friday?</i>

160
00:08:41,609 --> 00:08:43,520
Yeah. When are you getting
an air conditioner?</i>

161
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:47,807
It's coming.
It's a Commando 8, 12,000 BTUs.

162
00:08:48,049 --> 00:08:50,358
It's gonna be like
a meat locker in here.</i>

163
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:55,607
- I was an idiot for listening to you.
- Hey, I saw what I saw.</i>

164
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:58,488
Everything was going so well.
She hadn't seen any flaws in me.</i>

165
00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:00,844
- Now she sees a side.
- What side?</i>

166
00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:03,284
- A bad side, an ugly side.
- So what?</i>

167
00:09:03,449 --> 00:09:06,566
I wasn't planning on showing
that side for another six months.</i>

168
00:09:07,409 --> 00:09:10,321
You made me throw off
the whole learning curve.</i>

169
00:09:10,489 --> 00:09:13,083
- Why don't you just ask Jeffrey.
- He'd just deny it.</i>

170
00:09:13,849 --> 00:09:16,966
- There must be some way to find out.
- Amy said nothing happened.</i>

171
00:09:17,129 --> 00:09:19,643
You're taking her word over mine?
I'm your best friend.</i>

172
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,720
But you're blind as a bat.</i>

173
00:09:22,449 --> 00:09:25,646
I was squinting! Remember that
drive from Wurtsboro?</i>

174
00:09:26,329 --> 00:09:28,968
I was spotting those raccoons.</i>

175
00:09:30,209 --> 00:09:33,599
They were mailboxes, you idiot.
I didn't have the heart to tell you.</i>

176
00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:41,325
Hey, look. A dime.</i>

177
00:09:47,409 --> 00:09:49,001
Mercury head.</i>

178
00:09:49,169 --> 00:09:51,763
- You mind?
- No, keep it.</i>

179
00:09:58,049 --> 00:09:59,687
What happened?
You buzzed five minutes ago.</i>

180
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,999
There was a dog in front,
and it spooked me.</i>

181
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:05,320
- I couldn't come in until he left.
- A little white dog?</i>

182
00:10:06,169 --> 00:10:08,160
- Yeah.
- Snowball?</i>

183
00:10:09,969 --> 00:10:11,687
You're afraid of Snowball?</i>

184
00:10:12,049 --> 00:10:13,607
I'm afraid of dogs now.

185
00:10:14,929 --> 00:10:17,124
He's like a squirrel.</i>

186
00:10:18,569 --> 00:10:19,797
Well, he frightened me.</i>

187
00:10:21,489 --> 00:10:24,606
- Did you get the shot?
- No. He said I didn't need a shot.</i>

188
00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:27,329
You got bit by a strange dog,
and you didn't get a shot?</i>

189
00:10:27,489 --> 00:10:29,002
You think I should have?</i>

190
00:10:29,649 --> 00:10:31,241
Just go back to the optical store...</i>

191
00:10:31,409 --> 00:10:33,604
...and ask Dwayne if he knows
the dog's owner.</i>

192
00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:35,327
Good idea. I'm gonna do that.</i>

193
00:10:39,409 --> 00:10:40,842
The AC's on its way.</i>

194
00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:43,398
Pardon me.
I went to see your friend Dwayne.</i>

195
00:10:43,569 --> 00:10:44,922
There was no discount.</i>

196
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:46,727
- What?
- That's right. No discount.

197
00:10:46,889 --> 00:10:49,357
- Did you mention my name?
- Yes, I mentioned your name.</i>

198
00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:51,087
- And?
- Bupkis.

199
00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:55,239
I don't believe this.
That guy owes me big time.</i>

200
00:10:55,409 --> 00:10:57,320
I got him off sugar!

201
00:10:57,489 --> 00:10:59,400
I'm gonna go down there
with you right now.</i>

202
00:10:59,569 --> 00:11:01,764
All right, let me just grab an apple.</i>

203
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:06,002
- Kramer, Elaine's afraid of Snowball.
- Little Snowball?</i>

204
00:11:06,169 --> 00:11:07,921
He runs on batteries.</i>

205
00:11:09,409 --> 00:11:10,762
You know, George...</i>

206
00:11:10,929 --> 00:11:12,362
...that's an onion.

207
00:11:19,609 --> 00:11:21,486
Yes, it is.</i>

208
00:11:25,169 --> 00:11:27,888
He couldn't tell an apple
from an onion...</i>

209
00:11:28,049 --> 00:11:30,279
...and he's your eyewitness.</i>

210
00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:33,403
I saw them making out.
You can believe it.</i>

211
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:36,208
I don't know what to believe.
Eating onions, spotting dimes.</i>

212
00:11:36,369 --> 00:11:38,678
I don't know what the hell
is going on!</i>

213
00:11:40,849 --> 00:11:44,125
Look, all you gotta do is get Amy
and Jeffrey together somewhere.</i>

214
00:11:44,289 --> 00:11:46,200
- That's it.
- Hey, wait a second.</i>

215
00:11:46,369 --> 00:11:49,645
I'm going over to Jeffrey's tomorrow
to pick up these Paul Simon tickets.</i>

216
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:52,846
I'm gonna surprise Amy.
All I gotta do is bring her with me.</i>

217
00:11:53,009 --> 00:11:56,126
Then when Jeffrey opens the door,
it's Howdy Doody time.</i>

218
00:11:56,289 --> 00:11:58,598
Right this way, Mr. Doody.

219
00:11:59,809 --> 00:12:01,879
You'll see. I'm right.</i>

220
00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:10,560
- Hey, Dwayney.
- Hello, Kramer.</i>

221
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:13,448
- What is going on here?
- What are you talking about?</i>

222
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:15,839
I'm talking about
the 30 percent discount.</i>

223
00:12:16,009 --> 00:12:17,237
Excuse me.</i>

224
00:12:17,409 --> 00:12:20,321
- A man came in here-
- Don't interrupt, they're discounting.</i>

225
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,286
Who said anything
about a discount?

226
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:25,527
Oh, how quickly we forget.</i>

227
00:12:25,689 --> 00:12:27,520
- You owe me, buddy.
- For what?</i>

228
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,280
- Remember this?
- What are you doing?</i>

229
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:32,360
You were eating four of those
for breakfast...</i>

230
00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:35,680
...and chasing it with a Ring Ding
and two Butterfingers on the train.</i>

231
00:12:35,849 --> 00:12:37,567
- Sound familiar?
- Put that away.

232
00:12:37,729 --> 00:12:39,720
Remember when I found you
at Dinky Doughnuts?</i>

233
00:12:39,889 --> 00:12:43,882
You were all hopped up
on cinnamon swirls!</i>

234
00:12:45,129 --> 00:12:46,926
They wouldn't serve you anymore.</i>

235
00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:49,523
You wouldn't have teeth
if it wasn't for me taking you...</i>

236
00:12:49,689 --> 00:12:52,681
...to Joe's fruit stand and stuffing
cantaloupe down your throat.</i>

237
00:12:52,849 --> 00:12:56,285
But so much for gratitude.
Yeah! Yeah!</i>

238
00:12:56,449 --> 00:12:58,167
All right! All right!

239
00:12:59,569 --> 00:13:02,163
I'll give him the discount.
Just put that thing away!</i>

240
00:13:02,769 --> 00:13:04,043
But this squares us.</i>

241
00:13:04,969 --> 00:13:06,721
- Could I just have the name-?
- Out!</i>

242
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:08,686
We'll see you, Dwayne.</i>

243
00:13:13,329 --> 00:13:15,889
I don't know what to tell you, Elton.</i>

244
00:13:17,449 --> 00:13:21,158
Listen to this. This is not good.
Listen to these symptoms for rabies:</i>

245
00:13:21,329 --> 00:13:23,524
Anxiety. Irritability.</i>

246
00:13:23,689 --> 00:13:25,486
I've got those. I'm irritable.</i>

247
00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:29,080
- Who picked these out?
- I did.</i>

248
00:13:29,249 --> 00:13:30,967
They're ladies' glasses.</i>

249
00:13:31,129 --> 00:13:34,599
All you need is a chain so you can
wear them while playing canasta.</i>

250
00:13:37,489 --> 00:13:39,480
Elaine was supposed to help me.</i>

251
00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:41,719
Hey, I got bit by a dog!</i>

252
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:44,119
I had to go to the hospital!
I was bleeding to death!</i>

253
00:13:44,289 --> 00:13:46,723
I can't solve every problem you have!</i>

254
00:13:46,889 --> 00:13:48,117
Hey, hey.</i>

255
00:13:51,209 --> 00:13:53,643
I'm sorry. Sorry.

256
00:13:55,409 --> 00:13:57,639
Commando 8 has arrived!</i>

257
00:13:57,809 --> 00:14:00,369
- I'll get the window.
- Twelve thousand BTUs...</i>

258
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:03,089
...of raw cooling power.</i>

259
00:14:04,729 --> 00:14:06,447
Yeah.</i>

260
00:14:07,369 --> 00:14:09,166
Installed.</i>

261
00:14:15,449 --> 00:14:17,326
That's it?
You don't have to screw it in?</i>

262
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:20,447
No. Just plug it in,
and the Commando 8 does the rest.</i>

263
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,281
- I'll seal it up later.
- Yeah.</i>

264
00:14:22,449 --> 00:14:25,441
- Just in time for Amy.
- When are you gonna execute that?</i>

265
00:14:25,609 --> 00:14:28,043
Oh, God.
I've got such a headache.</i>

266
00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:30,518
Oh, that's another symptom.</i>

267
00:14:30,689 --> 00:14:32,680
- Of what?
- Rabies.</i>

268
00:14:32,849 --> 00:14:34,521
That's fatal. You don't want that.

269
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:36,927
I know I don't want it.

270
00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:39,125
I don't need you to tell me
what I don't want...</i>

271
00:14:39,289 --> 00:14:40,517
...you stupid hipster doofus!</i>

272
00:14:40,689 --> 00:14:43,681
Hey, hey, what is this?</i>

273
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:45,123
What's going on here?</i>

274
00:14:45,289 --> 00:14:46,768
I'm sorry, Kramer. I'm sorry.</i>

275
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:48,362
No, it's all right.

276
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:50,440
I had a friend who had rabies once.</i>

277
00:14:52,049 --> 00:14:54,119
May I have one of those, madam?</i>

278
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:03,880
Madam? What are you
calling me madam for?</i>

279
00:15:04,049 --> 00:15:06,119
They're ladies' glasses.</i>

280
00:15:06,769 --> 00:15:08,282
Look, see? It's right here.</i>

281
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,519
"Gloria Vanderbilt Collection."</i>

282
00:15:12,449 --> 00:15:14,758
He sold me ladies' glasses!</i>

283
00:15:14,929 --> 00:15:16,521
I...</i>

284
00:15:16,689 --> 00:15:19,920
I think I'm-
I'm having trouble swallowing.</i>

285
00:15:22,609 --> 00:15:24,440
I- I can't swallow.

286
00:15:24,609 --> 00:15:28,363
She's got rabies,
just like my friend Bob Sacamano.</i>

287
00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:32,847
Look at that, she's delirious.
She's foaming at the mouth!</i>

288
00:15:37,529 --> 00:15:40,168
- Is this gonna hurt?
- Yes, very much.</i>

289
00:15:45,289 --> 00:15:47,803
- What if Jeffrey's not home?
- He'll be home.</i>

290
00:15:47,969 --> 00:15:50,244
Friday night, the big night
on the Nature Channel.</i>

291
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:51,603
Let me tell you something.</i>

292
00:15:51,769 --> 00:15:53,680
There is no way
cousin Jeffrey's dating Amy.</i>

293
00:15:53,849 --> 00:15:56,363
- He looks like a horse.
- He does look like a horse.</i>

294
00:15:56,529 --> 00:15:59,646
Yeah, he's got a real horse face.</i>

295
00:16:01,329 --> 00:16:02,603
Hey, look at this.</i>

296
00:16:02,769 --> 00:16:04,646
It's the guy with the dog.</i>

297
00:16:04,809 --> 00:16:06,925
Hey! Hey, you, down there!</i>

298
00:16:07,089 --> 00:16:08,283
Remember me?!</i>

299
00:16:08,449 --> 00:16:11,202
I had to get shots
because of your stupid dog!</i>

300
00:16:11,369 --> 00:16:13,041
Who are you calling stupid?</i>

301
00:16:13,209 --> 00:16:16,007
- Hey, should we spit on him?
- No, no. Come on. Let's go down.</i>

302
00:16:20,329 --> 00:16:21,728
The air conditioner!</i>

303
00:16:33,169 --> 00:16:34,966
I think it got the dog!</i>

304
00:16:41,689 --> 00:16:43,407
Oh, boy.

305
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:46,848
Excuse me. I'm new here.</i>

306
00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:49,318
Would you mind walking me
back to my locker?</i>

307
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:52,162
Sure, why not.</i>

308
00:16:52,729 --> 00:16:54,287
There you go.</i>

309
00:16:56,089 --> 00:16:57,681
- Hey, that's the guy.
- What guy?</i>

310
00:16:57,849 --> 00:16:59,328
The guy that stole my glasses.</i>

311
00:16:59,489 --> 00:17:01,764
This time I got him!</i>

312
00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:05,966
- Could you pick it up a little?
- Where the hell are we going?</i>

313
00:17:06,129 --> 00:17:07,881
He's getting on a bus. Damn.</i>

314
00:17:09,489 --> 00:17:10,763
Those are nice glasses.</i>

315
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:13,318
I don't like them.
They pinch my nose.</i>

316
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:16,486
Is that right?

317
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:20,964
My friend and I would like
to exchange frames.</i>

318
00:17:21,129 --> 00:17:23,518
Could you put his lenses
in my frames and mine in his?</i>

319
00:17:23,889 --> 00:17:25,322
Yeah, we can do that.</i>

320
00:17:25,489 --> 00:17:27,400
Excuse me one second.</i>

321
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:29,082
And I'd like a discount.</i>

322
00:17:29,809 --> 00:17:31,083
Why should I?

323
00:17:31,249 --> 00:17:33,479
You're lucky I'm not asking
for a whole refund.</i>

324
00:17:33,649 --> 00:17:35,401
You gave me ladies' frames.</i>

325
00:17:35,569 --> 00:17:37,127
What's that about ladies' frames?</i>

326
00:17:39,609 --> 00:17:43,602
Say, I'm trying to track down that lady
that was in here the other day.</i>

327
00:17:43,769 --> 00:17:45,646
Well, she's trying
to track you down.</i>

328
00:17:45,809 --> 00:17:47,765
Well, I would love to talk with her.</i>

329
00:17:47,929 --> 00:17:50,727
- She lives on 81 st Street, right?
- That's Jerry.</i>

330
00:17:50,889 --> 00:17:52,038
Really?</i>

331
00:17:52,209 --> 00:17:54,439
You wouldn't happen to know
what apartment he's in?</i>

332
00:17:54,609 --> 00:17:55,803
Yeah, 5A.</i>

333
00:17:56,769 --> 00:17:57,963
Thanks a lot.

334
00:18:00,129 --> 00:18:02,927
- What are we doing here?
- Oh, you'll find out.</i>

335
00:18:03,089 --> 00:18:05,159
I don't know.
You're acting very mysteriously.</i>

336
00:18:05,329 --> 00:18:07,797
Well, I'm very mysterious by nature.</i>

337
00:18:08,729 --> 00:18:11,880
- A lot of women find that attractive.
- I find it annoying.</i>

338
00:18:16,009 --> 00:18:17,886
Hello!</i>

339
00:18:18,769 --> 00:18:21,806
- Uncle Leo.
- Come on in.</i>

340
00:18:22,529 --> 00:18:24,326
- This is Amy.
- Hello, Amy.</i>

341
00:18:24,489 --> 00:18:27,242
- What are you doing here?
- Jeffrey went out tonight.</i>

342
00:18:27,729 --> 00:18:29,481
Very convenient.</i>

343
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:32,403
I'm supposed to tape
this nature show for him.</i>

344
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:34,924
He loves nature, botany, zoology.</i>

345
00:18:35,089 --> 00:18:38,604
You know, his botany teacher from
college stays in close touch with him.</i>

346
00:18:38,769 --> 00:18:40,885
- They became friends.
- Really?</i>

347
00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:42,926
That's pretty rare!</i>

348
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:44,568
I mean, actual friends!</i>

349
00:18:44,729 --> 00:18:46,447
Like equals.</i>

350
00:18:46,609 --> 00:18:48,565
They have dinner together,
discussions.</i>

351
00:18:48,729 --> 00:18:52,165
Uncle Leo, did he leave
any tickets here for me?</i>

352
00:18:52,329 --> 00:18:53,682
Oh, yeah. I'll get them.</i>

353
00:18:53,849 --> 00:18:55,362
Thank you.

354
00:18:55,529 --> 00:18:59,078
- What tickets?
- The Paul Simon "Concert in the Park."</i>

355
00:18:59,249 --> 00:19:02,321
- We're going to the concert?
- That's right, lady.</i>

356
00:19:02,489 --> 00:19:05,128
- What a great surprise!
- I thought you'd like that.</i>

357
00:19:05,889 --> 00:19:08,403
So that's why you've been acting
so mysteriously.</i>

358
00:19:08,569 --> 00:19:11,800
Now you know.
That and that alone is the reason.</i>

359
00:19:12,849 --> 00:19:15,443
You know Jeffrey's favourite animal?</i>

360
00:19:15,609 --> 00:19:17,600
The leopard.</i>

361
00:19:18,409 --> 00:19:22,288
- Why is that?
- He likes the spots.</i>

362
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:25,727
- Oh, here's the tickets.
- Thank you.</i>

363
00:19:26,329 --> 00:19:28,160
Oh, he asked me to give you
a message.</i>

364
00:19:28,329 --> 00:19:29,808
He said that...</i>

365
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:33,644
...he's very sorry,
and he hopes you'll forgive him.</i>

366
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:38,277
So it's true!
You were making out with him.</i>

367
00:19:38,449 --> 00:19:40,838
What are you talking about?
I don't know Jeffrey.</i>

368
00:19:41,329 --> 00:19:43,240
So this is why
you brought me up here.</i>

369
00:19:43,409 --> 00:19:45,877
Very convincing,
but it's not gonna work this time.</i>

370
00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:48,005
What are you talking about?</i>

371
00:19:48,169 --> 00:19:52,799
All he meant was that he was sorry
that the seats aren't very good.</i>

372
00:19:59,729 --> 00:20:01,640
Wanna get some pizza?</i>

373
00:20:09,489 --> 00:20:14,517
- Boy, these really do pinch the nose.
- Tough luck. A deal's a deal.</i>

374
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:16,317
Oh, my God. It is them.</i>

375
00:20:37,489 --> 00:20:40,799
I still don't know how you spotted
that dime. I think you planted it.</i>

376
00:20:41,369 --> 00:20:43,564
Plus, I gotta pay that vet bill
for the stupid dog.</i>

377
00:20:43,729 --> 00:20:45,765
I don't know how that guy
got my name.</i>

378
00:20:47,529 --> 00:20:49,121
Yeah.</i>

379
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:52,958
Boy, these really do pinch.</i>

380
00:20:53,129 --> 00:20:56,917
If I ever find the son of a bitch
that stole my glasses...</i>

381
00:21:07,609 --> 00:21:11,568
When did glasses go from being
this carefully crafted apparatus...</i>

382
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:13,560
...to just this mall impulse item?</i>

383
00:21:13,729 --> 00:21:17,085
"Honey, I'm going out for yogurt
and trifocals. Need anything?"</i>

384
00:21:17,489 --> 00:21:19,002
"Glasses in a about an hour."</i>

385
00:21:19,169 --> 00:21:23,845
"How much?""Seventy-five bucks."
"Well, here's 72. It's about 75."</i>

386
00:21:24,009 --> 00:21:26,762
What, you're trying to coordinate
with the one-hour photo place?</i>

387
00:21:26,929 --> 00:21:31,002
"Hurry up! Give me the glasses. My
pictures are coming. I need to see!"</i>

388
00:21:31,849 --> 00:21:34,317
Then they have those
Woolworth glasses.</i>

389
00:21:34,489 --> 00:21:36,639
They're there. They're there now.</i>

390
00:21:36,849 --> 00:21:39,044
No exam. You don't have any idea
what's wrong.</i>

391
00:21:39,209 --> 00:21:41,803
And the glasses are made up.
They're ready and waiting.</i>

392
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:44,529
"Thank you."
You just walk into a wall.

393
