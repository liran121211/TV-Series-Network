1
00:00:02,209 --> 00:00:03,528
<i>I had glasses when I was 10.</i>

2
00:00:04,889 --> 00:00:06,766
<i>Anybody beat that?
Anybody got them younger?</i>

3
00:00:06,929 --> 00:00:08,681
<i>- Seven.
- Seven?</i>

4
00:00:09,049 --> 00:00:10,482
Two?

5
00:00:14,209 --> 00:00:17,360
<i>Anybody born with glasses?
Come out...</i>

6
00:00:17,529 --> 00:00:19,918
<i>Actually come out
of the birth canal and go:</i>

7
00:00:20,089 --> 00:00:23,047
<i>"That was a hell of a delivery,
I'll tell you that.</i>

8
00:00:26,089 --> 00:00:28,239
<i>Can I clean these?</i>

9
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:30,919
<i>Does anybody have one
of those little cloths?</i>

10
00:00:31,089 --> 00:00:33,649
<i>I was just born. They're a little...</i>

11
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:35,288
<i>A little smudgy."</i>

12
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:43,799
- Fantastic.
- I told you. How good is this?

13
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:45,322
- It's good.
- How good?

14
00:00:45,489 --> 00:00:46,478
<i>- Very good.
- I know.</i>

15
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:49,527
<i>They put real blueberries in this.
What kind did you get?</i>

16
00:00:49,689 --> 00:00:52,078
<i>Coffee. They grind up
the coffee beans and put it in!</i>

17
00:00:52,249 --> 00:00:54,444
<i>Let me test-taste that.</i>

18
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:02,287
<i>- And it's non-fat.
- How could this not have any fat?</i>

19
00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:04,087
<i>- It's too good.
- You wanna taste mine?</i>

20
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:06,560
<i>- Oh, you wanna taste mine.
- No, I don't.</i>

21
00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:09,846
<i>If you wanna taste mine, you don't
have to offer me some of yours.</i>

22
00:01:10,169 --> 00:01:12,239
<i>All right, let's just forget it.</i>

23
00:01:12,609 --> 00:01:14,486
<i>Kramer's gonna clean up
on this place.</i>

24
00:01:14,649 --> 00:01:16,287
<i>- What do you mean?
- He invested in it.</i>

25
00:01:16,449 --> 00:01:18,758
<i>- No kidding?
- We've been coming here every day.</i>

26
00:01:18,929 --> 00:01:22,319
This is so f*****g good!

27
00:01:22,489 --> 00:01:24,002
<i>Jerry!</i>

28
00:01:24,769 --> 00:01:26,999
Oh, I'm sorry.

29
00:01:27,809 --> 00:01:29,561
<i>- That's nice.
- All right.</i>

30
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:32,766
<i>We should get going, but I'm gonna
get a little bit more, okay?</i>

31
00:01:34,569 --> 00:01:37,322
<i>- Oh, God, look who's here.
- Who is it?</i>

32
00:01:37,489 --> 00:01:40,208
<i>This guy from my old neighbourhood,
Lloyd Braun.</i>

33
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:44,078
<i>He's a big adviser to Mayor Dinkins.
He thinks he's so cool.</i>

34
00:01:44,249 --> 00:01:45,762
<i>Really?</i>

35
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:48,960
<i>Hey, George.</i>

36
00:01:49,129 --> 00:01:51,484
<i>Hey, Lloyd!</i>

37
00:01:52,129 --> 00:01:53,357
<i>Hey!</i>

38
00:01:53,529 --> 00:01:55,281
<i>My friend Jerry.</i>

39
00:01:55,809 --> 00:01:58,118
<i>So I hear you're living back home now,
or something?</i>

40
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:02,724
<i>Yeah, there was a fire
in my apartment.</i>

41
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:04,607
<i>A fire.</i>

42
00:02:05,089 --> 00:02:07,842
<i>There's a lot of major chicks
in this place, huh?</i>

43
00:02:09,609 --> 00:02:11,520
<i>Something wrong with your arm?</i>

44
00:02:14,089 --> 00:02:16,080
<i>Yeah, actually.</i>

45
00:02:16,689 --> 00:02:20,921
<i>I bumped my elbow on a desk
and injured something...</i>

46
00:02:21,089 --> 00:02:23,922
<i>...and now it sort of
moves involuntarily.</i>

47
00:02:25,529 --> 00:02:27,087
That's a bitch, huh?

48
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:30,128
<i>- So how are your parents doing?
- Oh, pretty good.</i>

49
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:36,359
<i>- This place does some business, huh?
- Yeah, this is my first time here.</i>

50
00:02:36,969 --> 00:02:38,925
<i>Hey, she's a doll.</i>

51
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,603
Hi.

52
00:02:40,849 --> 00:02:43,363
<i>- Hello.
- Elaine, this is Lloyd.</i>

53
00:02:43,529 --> 00:02:45,281
<i>- Hi.
- Hi. Very nice to meet you.</i>

54
00:02:45,449 --> 00:02:46,802
<i>Nice to meet you too.</i>

55
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:51,843
<i>Boy, I'm really sorry
I gotta run now.</i>

56
00:02:53,529 --> 00:02:55,918
<i>- Well, take it easy, huh, George?
- Yeah, yeah.</i>

57
00:02:56,089 --> 00:02:57,761
<i>- Bye-bye.
- Bye.</i>

58
00:03:00,369 --> 00:03:03,406
<i>- Boy, he is really cute.
- He's a jerk.</i>

59
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:05,799
<i>- He's gone, George.
- All right, all right.</i>

60
00:03:09,809 --> 00:03:11,401
<i>So there were a lot of people there?</i>

61
00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:13,639
<i>That yogurt place-
You're gonna make a fortune.</i>

62
00:03:13,809 --> 00:03:16,482
<i>- They're doing incredible business.
- I told you to go in on it.</i>

63
00:03:16,649 --> 00:03:19,607
<i>- How did you know?
- Well, I tasted it at the one downtown.</i>

64
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:21,646
<i>It's got a remarkable texture.</i>

65
00:03:21,809 --> 00:03:23,561
<i>You'd never know it was non-fat.</i>

66
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:28,601
<i>- Yeah?
- Me.</i>

67
00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:32,119
<i>Hey, I had the show of my life
last night.</i>

68
00:03:32,289 --> 00:03:35,087
<i>- I ad-libbed, like, 10 new minutes.
- Yeah, but did you tape it?</i>

69
00:03:35,249 --> 00:03:37,126
<i>- Yeah.
- Right there. I got it.</i>

70
00:03:37,289 --> 00:03:38,927
<i>I did this thing on
the Ottoman Empire:</i>

71
00:03:39,089 --> 00:03:42,286
<i>What, was this a whole empire
based on putting your feet up?</i>

72
00:03:42,929 --> 00:03:45,648
<i>I'm telling you, I got a whole
new Tonight Show here.</i>

73
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:49,487
<i>- Hi.
- Hey.</i>

74
00:03:49,649 --> 00:03:51,321
<i>What's the matter?</i>

75
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:53,445
<i>I was having lunch
and I bit down on the fork.</i>

76
00:03:53,809 --> 00:03:56,118
<i>It's hard to believe
with so much biting experience...</i>

77
00:03:56,289 --> 00:03:58,484
<i>...a person could still
make a mistake like that.</i>

78
00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:02,361
<i>- What?
- You're getting heavy.</i>

79
00:04:03,929 --> 00:04:07,365
<i>- What?
- You look like you put on 5...</i>

80
00:04:07,529 --> 00:04:08,848
...10 pounds.

81
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:11,921
<i>- Kramer!
- I'll tell you something else...</i>

82
00:04:12,089 --> 00:04:13,841
<i>...you're looking
a little chunky yourself.</i>

83
00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:15,318
<i>- Me?
- Yeah.</i>

84
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:18,083
<i>- No.
- Where's your bathroom scale?</i>

85
00:04:23,089 --> 00:04:26,126
<i>Oh, my God! I've gained 7 pounds!</i>

86
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:28,804
<i>- I've gained 8!
- I told you.</i>

87
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:31,881
<i>I thought I'd put on a couple, but
7 pounds, how did I gain 7 pounds?</i>

88
00:04:32,049 --> 00:04:34,119
<i>- How did I gain 8?
- I don't get it.</i>

89
00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:37,281
<i>I've been doing the same exercises.
I haven't been eating different.</i>

90
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:38,802
<i>Me either.</i>

91
00:04:38,969 --> 00:04:40,880
<i>Wait a second.
Maybe it's that yogurt.</i>

92
00:04:41,049 --> 00:04:44,598
<i>- No, no. That's 100-percent non-fat.
- How else could this have happened?</i>

93
00:04:44,769 --> 00:04:46,919
<i>- Maybe it's the Oreos.
- I don't eat Oreos.</i>

94
00:04:47,089 --> 00:04:49,887
<i>You don't eat Oreos?
The way you break them open...</i>

95
00:04:51,329 --> 00:04:53,001
<i>You're practically having
sex with them.</i>

96
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:55,683
<i>- What about me?
- You? You're getting old.</i>

97
00:04:56,369 --> 00:05:00,567
<i>- Maybe your yogurt isn't so non-fat.
- Oh, guess again, tubby.</i>

98
00:05:02,249 --> 00:05:04,240
<i>There's gotta be a way
we can find that out.</i>

99
00:05:04,409 --> 00:05:06,445
<i>There must be a kind of lab
that would do that.</i>

100
00:05:06,929 --> 00:05:09,841
<i>I've got it! I'll call
the Food and Drug Administration.</i>

101
00:05:12,849 --> 00:05:14,567
<i>Hey, I'll tell you what, chubs.</i>

102
00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:19,245
<i>If that yogurt has fat in it, I will
put myself on an all-yogurt diet...</i>

103
00:05:19,409 --> 00:05:21,969
<i>- ... for a week.
- Well, let's start the insanity.</i>

104
00:05:23,769 --> 00:05:25,168
Giddyup.

105
00:05:28,609 --> 00:05:31,282
<i>"Tommy Tune
is a very good dancer."</i>

106
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:35,684
<i>You ever see Tommy Tune dance?</i>

107
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:42,959
<i>- No.
- I like tap-dancing.</i>

108
00:05:43,129 --> 00:05:45,484
<i>Tap-dancing. Anyone can tap-dance.
It's those shoes.</i>

109
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:48,721
<i>Are you kidding?
They practice for years, those people.</i>

110
00:05:49,209 --> 00:05:50,767
<i>What's for supper?</i>

111
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:53,600
<i>Somebody's at the door.</i>

112
00:05:53,769 --> 00:05:55,088
<i>Tommy Tune is very tall.</i>

113
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:58,767
<i>That helps. It makes him lankier.</i>

114
00:05:59,929 --> 00:06:02,762
<i>- Lloyd!
- Hello, Mrs. Costanza.</i>

115
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:05,284
<i>Georgie, Lloyd Braun is here.</i>

116
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:08,327
<i>- Hey, Lloyd!
- What are you doing here?</i>

117
00:06:08,489 --> 00:06:11,606
<i>Well, I was just visiting my mother,
so I thought I'd drop by, say hello.</i>

118
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:13,959
<i>Georgie, come here and say hello.</i>

119
00:06:14,129 --> 00:06:16,518
<i>How you doing? I hear
you're a big adviser for Dinkins.</i>

120
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:21,166
<i>- That's right. Hey, George.
- Hey, Lloyd. How's it going?</i>

121
00:06:21,329 --> 00:06:23,445
<i>I ran into George yesterday
in the city.</i>

122
00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:29,519
<i>What's the matter with you?</i>

123
00:06:30,529 --> 00:06:31,803
<i>So how's the arm?</i>

124
00:06:31,969 --> 00:06:34,085
<i>- Oh, it's good.
- What's the matter with your arm?</i>

125
00:06:34,249 --> 00:06:36,558
<i>- Nothing.
- Yeah, his arm moves like this.</i>

126
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:40,085
<i>Your arm moves like this? I've never
seen your arm move like this.</i>

127
00:06:40,249 --> 00:06:42,444
<i>- Me either.
- Well, it comes and goes.</i>

128
00:06:42,609 --> 00:06:44,281
<i>It's like some kind of...</i>

129
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:46,087
<i>- ... a spasm.
- Yeah.</i>

130
00:06:46,369 --> 00:06:48,803
<i>I asked Mr. Dinkins if he knew
any good orthopaedists.</i>

131
00:06:48,969 --> 00:06:52,803
<i>He said he had the best. So I made
an appointment for you. Dr. Dekter.</i>

132
00:06:52,969 --> 00:06:55,608
<i>Mayor Dinkins got
an appointment for him?</i>

133
00:06:55,769 --> 00:06:58,237
<i>You mentioned George's name
to Mayor Dinkins?</i>

134
00:06:58,409 --> 00:07:00,923
<i>You discussed George
with the mayor of New York?</i>

135
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:05,680
<i>Dinkins was talking about you.
He was discussing you!</i>

136
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,000
<i>You know, Lloyd,
I've been to the doctor.</i>

137
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:09,807
<i>- There's nothing they can do.
- Hey!</i>

138
00:07:09,969 --> 00:07:11,561
<i>Mayor Dinkins set this up for you.</i>

139
00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:13,959
<i>You know what kind of a doctor
he must be?</i>

140
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:16,245
All right. All right, I'll go.

141
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:17,963
<i>Well, that's great.</i>

142
00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:21,360
<i>And I'll be very interested
to hear the diagnosis.</i>

143
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:28,882
<i>Okay, well, we're coming down.
All right. Okay.</i>

144
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:31,722
<i>I got a place that can analyze it.
It's in Brooklyn.</i>

145
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:34,005
<i>- They said they could do it?
- Yeah. It's 45 bucks.</i>

146
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:37,366
<i>All right, let's go to the yogurt store
and get a specimen.</i>

147
00:07:40,049 --> 00:07:42,199
<i>- Well, I hope you're satisfied.
- What?</i>

148
00:07:42,369 --> 00:07:45,361
<i>Every word out of my son's
mouth now is f**k, f**k, f**k.</i>

149
00:07:48,249 --> 00:07:50,479
<i>You know what he said to me
five minutes ago?</i>

150
00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:52,281
<i>"Where's my f*****g cupcake?"</i>

151
00:07:54,929 --> 00:07:56,601
<i>Gee, I'm really sorry.</i>

152
00:07:56,769 --> 00:07:59,408
<i>He wants to be like you
because you're a comedian.</i>

153
00:07:59,569 --> 00:08:01,844
<i>- Maybe you could talk to him.
- I'd be happy to.</i>

154
00:08:02,009 --> 00:08:03,203
Thank you.

155
00:08:03,369 --> 00:08:06,486
<i>Mary, we've been eating
a lot of your husband's yogurt...</i>

156
00:08:06,649 --> 00:08:09,209
<i>...at the yogurt place.
Does that have any fat in it?</i>

157
00:08:09,369 --> 00:08:11,599
No f*****g way.

158
00:08:15,449 --> 00:08:20,079
<i>- It was very nice seeing you again.
- Oh, it was good seeing you.</i>

159
00:08:21,649 --> 00:08:24,607
<i>By the way, who was that gorgeous
woman I saw you with the other day?</i>

160
00:08:26,329 --> 00:08:28,684
<i>- Just a friend of mine.
- You must mean Elaine.</i>

161
00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:31,158
<i>- Isn't she adorable?
- She is, she is.</i>

162
00:08:31,329 --> 00:08:33,843
<i>How about giving me her number?</i>

163
00:08:34,009 --> 00:08:36,204
<i>You know, Lloyd,
I really don't have it.</i>

164
00:08:36,369 --> 00:08:39,167
<i>She works at Pendant Publishing.</i>

165
00:08:39,569 --> 00:08:41,560
<i>Elaine Benes.</i>

166
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,765
<i>- Great. Thanks a lot.
- Yeah.</i>

167
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:45,999
<i>- Bye-bye.
- Bye.</i>

168
00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:52,165
<i>Oh, that Lloyd Braun,
he is something, isn't he?</i>

169
00:08:54,889 --> 00:08:57,119
<i>I wouldn't hear of it.
I said, "Nice try, granny"...</i>

170
00:08:57,289 --> 00:08:59,644
<i>...and I sent her to the back
of the line.</i>

171
00:09:05,849 --> 00:09:07,441
<i>Hello, Newman.</i>

172
00:09:08,889 --> 00:09:10,288
<i>Hello, Jerry.</i>

173
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:13,839
<i>Say, this yogurt is really something,
huh? And it's non-fat!</i>

174
00:09:14,009 --> 00:09:18,207
<i>I've been waiting for something like
this my whole life, and it's finally here!</i>

175
00:09:20,409 --> 00:09:22,001
<i>Hey, Seinfeld.</i>

176
00:09:22,249 --> 00:09:25,207
<i>I'd appreciate if you'd stop using
obscenities around my son, huh?</i>

177
00:09:25,369 --> 00:09:27,599
<i>It was an accident.
I'm gonna talk to him.</i>

178
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:30,602
<i>I'll have a small plain vanilla
in a cup to go.</i>

179
00:09:31,329 --> 00:09:33,684
- That's non-fat, right?
- That's right.

180
00:09:33,849 --> 00:09:34,884
<i>I'm on a special diet.</i>

181
00:09:35,049 --> 00:09:37,961
<i>- The doctor said I can't have any fat.
- Yeah, well, there is no fat.</i>

182
00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:40,597
<i>Hey, another round of strawberry
for me and my friends!</i>

183
00:09:45,089 --> 00:09:47,478
<i>- Hurry, Jerry, hurry.
- How's it doing?</i>

184
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:48,638
Not so good.

185
00:09:48,809 --> 00:09:50,845
<i>You can't have this tested now.
It's melting.</i>

186
00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:53,364
<i>- So what?
- It changes the molecules.</i>

187
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:55,281
<i>You don't know
what you're talking about.</i>

188
00:09:55,449 --> 00:09:58,725
<i>Hey, fatso, I got a 90 in biology.</i>

189
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:01,403
<i>You call me fatso again,
you're gonna be walking back.</i>

190
00:10:05,209 --> 00:10:07,928
<i>Hi. I called earlier about
getting the yogurt tested?</i>

191
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:10,967
<i>Oh, right.
Would you fill this out, please?</i>

192
00:10:11,129 --> 00:10:13,848
<i>- Does it matter if it's melted?
- No.</i>

193
00:10:16,889 --> 00:10:19,164
<i>- This is gonna take a couple of days.
- That's okay.</i>

194
00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:21,408
<i>Hello there.</i>

195
00:10:22,969 --> 00:10:24,561
<i>Hello.</i>

196
00:10:25,449 --> 00:10:26,802
<i>Test tubes.</i>

197
00:10:26,969 --> 00:10:28,243
Cool.

198
00:10:28,449 --> 00:10:32,044
<i>- What do you got there?
- Actually, this is Mr. Giuliani's blood.</i>

199
00:10:32,209 --> 00:10:34,598
<i>We're doing a cholesterol workup on it.</i>

200
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:36,441
<i>Okay, I'm done.</i>

201
00:10:37,289 --> 00:10:41,282
<i>- It was really nice meeting you.
- Well, the pleasure's all mine.</i>

202
00:10:45,129 --> 00:10:47,563
<i>- You can't take that chemist out.
- Why not?</i>

203
00:10:47,729 --> 00:10:50,197
<i>Because she's like the jury.
She's gotta be sequestered.</i>

204
00:10:50,369 --> 00:10:53,167
<i>I'm not taking her out
just to influence the results.</i>

205
00:10:53,329 --> 00:10:56,321
<i>- I think the whole thing stinks.
- It smells. Smells bad.</i>

206
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,968
<i>- Smells really bad.
- That's enough.</i>

207
00:10:58,129 --> 00:10:59,357
<i>- What?
- With the smells.</i>

208
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:05,041
<i>So he made an appointment for me
to see Dinkins' doctor.</i>

209
00:11:05,209 --> 00:11:07,404
<i>He's just trying to humiliate me.</i>

210
00:11:07,569 --> 00:11:11,323
<i>And I have to go. If I don't go,
he'll know I'm lying.</i>

211
00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:15,362
<i>What are you gonna do,
sit in the doctor's office doing this?</i>

212
00:11:15,529 --> 00:11:17,804
<i>He's gonna think
you're a mental patient.</i>

213
00:11:18,849 --> 00:11:20,202
<i>I don't care.</i>

214
00:11:20,369 --> 00:11:22,439
<i>Look, Lloyd doesn't know
what he's up against.</i>

215
00:11:22,609 --> 00:11:24,520
<i>This is nothing to me.</i>

216
00:11:24,689 --> 00:11:26,759
<i>My whole life is a lie.</i>

217
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:30,128
<i>- Hey.
- Hey.</i>

218
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:31,802
<i>So guess who called me.</i>

219
00:11:31,969 --> 00:11:35,405
<i>- Oh, don't tell me. Lloyd?
- We're going out tomorrow night.</i>

220
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:38,879
<i>All right, look, he's gonna ask you
about my arm.</i>

221
00:11:39,049 --> 00:11:41,165
<i>So just tell him I banged it
against a desk...</i>

222
00:11:41,329 --> 00:11:43,445
<i>...and it's been moving involuntarily
ever since.</i>

223
00:11:43,609 --> 00:11:44,803
I can't say that.

224
00:11:45,489 --> 00:11:47,605
<i>- Why not?
- What if I like him?</i>

225
00:11:47,769 --> 00:11:50,806
<i>- I'm gonna start out lying to this guy?
- So you're taking his side?</i>

226
00:11:50,969 --> 00:11:52,687
<i>No, but what if we get married?</i>

227
00:11:52,849 --> 00:11:55,124
<i>We'll always have that between us.</i>

228
00:11:55,289 --> 00:11:57,484
<i>Already you're marrying this guy?</i>

229
00:11:57,649 --> 00:11:59,241
<i>- You never know.
- Believe me...</i>

230
00:11:59,409 --> 00:12:02,401
<i>- ... you're not gonna marry him.
- What if we become a couple?</i>

231
00:12:02,569 --> 00:12:05,766
<i>Every time we see you, you're gonna
be walking around going like this?</i>

232
00:12:05,929 --> 00:12:07,487
<i>Even you can't keep that up.</i>

233
00:12:07,649 --> 00:12:09,446
<i>Oh, I believe he can.</i>

234
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:15,968
- Hi.
- Hi.

235
00:12:16,129 --> 00:12:19,485
<i>- You know Jerry.
- Of course. He's a funny f****r.</i>

236
00:12:22,289 --> 00:12:23,483
<i>See?</i>

237
00:12:26,769 --> 00:12:30,079
<i>Listen, Matthew, I want to explain
something to you.</i>

238
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:35,045
<i>Now, cursing is not something
that most comedians do.</i>

239
00:12:36,369 --> 00:12:39,805
<i>- You did it.
- That's true, but it was an accident.</i>

240
00:12:39,969 --> 00:12:42,563
<i>I haven't done it since,
and I would never do it again.</i>

241
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,965
<i>If you continue cursing,
you'll never become...</i>

242
00:12:45,129 --> 00:12:46,721
<i>...a comedian like me
when you grow up.</i>

243
00:12:48,329 --> 00:12:49,921
<i>Excuse me one second.</i>

244
00:12:53,729 --> 00:12:56,801
<i>You know, Lloyd advises Dinkins
on everything he does.</i>

245
00:12:56,969 --> 00:13:00,325
<i>- Yeah, yeah. Big adviser.
- He tells him what soap to use.</i>

246
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:06,568
<i>What the f**k are you doing,
you little piece of s**t?!</i>

247
00:13:15,409 --> 00:13:17,798
<i>We don't want to disturb
the security guard.</i>

248
00:13:17,969 --> 00:13:19,243
<i>Where's the lights?</i>

249
00:13:20,369 --> 00:13:23,805
<i>- How about this?
- Yeah.</i>

250
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,641
<i>A Bunsen burner.</i>

251
00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:37,644
<i>You want a taste? It's cappuccino.</i>

252
00:13:42,609 --> 00:13:43,758
<i>It's delicious.</i>

253
00:13:44,049 --> 00:13:46,404
<i>- I hear you.
- Non-fat?</i>

254
00:13:46,569 --> 00:13:47,763
<i>Well...</i>

255
00:13:48,089 --> 00:13:49,442
<i>...you tell me.</i>

256
00:13:50,289 --> 00:13:51,802
<i>Is the verdict in yet?</i>

257
00:13:52,689 --> 00:13:54,327
No.

258
00:13:54,729 --> 00:13:56,003
<i>Well...</i>

259
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,558
<i>...this is in case there's a tie.</i>

260
00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:14,527
<i>As far as I know,
he bumped his arm into a door...</i>

261
00:14:14,689 --> 00:14:16,725
...and it's kind of got...

262
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:21,360
<i>...this involuntary movement.
It's some sort of a spasm.</i>

263
00:14:22,849 --> 00:14:25,761
<i>So anyway, you're a big adviser
to Dinkins, huh?</i>

264
00:14:25,929 --> 00:14:28,238
<i>Yeah, yeah. It's coming
right down the wire.</i>

265
00:14:29,289 --> 00:14:31,405
Know what I would do
if I was running for mayor?

266
00:14:31,569 --> 00:14:33,480
<i>One of my campaign themes
would be...</i>

267
00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:37,198
<i>...that everybody should wear
nametags to make the city friendlier.</i>

268
00:14:37,369 --> 00:14:39,758
<i>- Nametags, huh?
- Everybody would know everybody.</i>

269
00:14:39,929 --> 00:14:42,079
<i>It would be like a small town.</i>

270
00:14:42,369 --> 00:14:45,327
<i>- Maybe I'll mention that to him.
- Really?</i>

271
00:14:47,569 --> 00:14:50,367
<i>- You sure you don't want any yogurt?
- No, I'm watching my weight.</i>

272
00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:53,647
<i>- Oh, it's non-fat.
- Yeah, so they say.</i>

273
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:56,198
<i>- Well, shall we go?
- Yeah, okay.</i>

274
00:15:05,609 --> 00:15:07,804
<i>Three days he hasn't called me,
and you know why?</i>

275
00:15:07,969 --> 00:15:10,085
<i>Because he thinks I'm too fat.</i>

276
00:15:10,249 --> 00:15:11,568
<i>- He said that?
- No.</i>

277
00:15:11,729 --> 00:15:14,482
<i>But I saw the look on his face
when he put his arm around me.</i>

278
00:15:14,849 --> 00:15:18,762
<i>Then we went to his apartment,
and I sat on one of his chairs...</i>

279
00:15:18,929 --> 00:15:20,123
<i>...and it broke.</i>

280
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:24,964
<i>And he says,
"Boy, you're a lot of woman."</i>

281
00:15:28,049 --> 00:15:30,609
<i>Hey, so hear anything
on the yogurt?</i>

282
00:15:30,769 --> 00:15:34,921
<i>- No, but I expect to hear any time.
- Well, I wouldn't get your hopes up.</i>

283
00:15:35,089 --> 00:15:37,649
<i>- Why do you say that?
- No reason.</i>

284
00:15:38,529 --> 00:15:40,360
<i>Did you hear about that Dinkins?</i>

285
00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:42,565
<i>- What about him?
- You didn't hear?</i>

286
00:15:42,729 --> 00:15:46,847
<i>He's proposing a plan where everyone
in the city should wear nametags.</i>

287
00:15:47,849 --> 00:15:49,601
<i>- Nametags?
- So people can go around...</i>

288
00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:51,122
<i>...saying hello to one another.</i>

289
00:15:51,289 --> 00:15:55,328
<i>Oh, I see. So you go, "Hey, you know
who I saw wilding today? Herb!"</i>

290
00:15:55,489 --> 00:15:56,922
<i>He's becoming a laughingstock!</i>

291
00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:01,401
<i>The Times has already stated it could
cost him the election. Nametags!</i>

292
00:16:04,769 --> 00:16:05,758
<i>Hello?</i>

293
00:16:06,409 --> 00:16:07,762
<i>Yes.</i>

294
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:10,038
<i>Yeah-</i>

295
00:16:10,529 --> 00:16:11,962
<i>Oh, really?</i>

296
00:16:12,449 --> 00:16:14,565
<i>Okay. Thank you very much.</i>

297
00:16:14,729 --> 00:16:17,004
<i>Bye-bye. Well...</i>

298
00:16:17,249 --> 00:16:19,365
<i>...the yogurt verdict is in.</i>

299
00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:21,201
Fat!

300
00:16:25,969 --> 00:16:27,800
<i>The next morning, I woke up...</i>

301
00:16:29,369 --> 00:16:32,042
<i>...and it was going like this.</i>

302
00:16:32,649 --> 00:16:35,959
<i>I can control it
if I really concentrate...</i>

303
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:37,721
<i>...but otherwise-</i>

304
00:16:39,849 --> 00:16:43,080
<i>Yes, well, I'm going to have to be
perfectly honest with you.</i>

305
00:16:43,249 --> 00:16:45,001
<i>- Please, doctor.
- I've examined you...</i>

306
00:16:45,169 --> 00:16:47,080
<i>...I've looked at your x-rays...</i>

307
00:16:47,249 --> 00:16:50,241
<i>...and I find that there's absolutely
nothing wrong with you.</i>

308
00:16:54,769 --> 00:16:56,361
<i>Really?</i>

309
00:16:56,769 --> 00:16:57,997
- Nothing?
- Nothing...

310
00:16:58,169 --> 00:17:00,319
<i>...that would indicate
involuntary spasms.</i>

311
00:17:02,849 --> 00:17:04,919
<i>Well, it's kind of a mystery, isn't it?</i>

312
00:17:05,489 --> 00:17:07,684
<i>- No, not really.
- How so?</i>

313
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:10,363
<i>May I suggest the possibility
that you're faking.</i>

314
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:12,362
Faking?

315
00:17:12,969 --> 00:17:15,164
<i>What makes you think
that I have time...</i>

316
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:17,684
<i>...to see doctors take x-rays,
make appointments...</i>

317
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:19,885
<i>...when there's absolutely nothing
wrong with me?</i>

318
00:17:20,049 --> 00:17:22,244
<i>What kind of a person
would do a thing like that?</i>

319
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:25,128
<i>I don't know what kind of person
would do something like that.</i>

320
00:17:25,289 --> 00:17:27,519
<i>Obviously a very sick person.</i>

321
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,363
<i>A very immature person.</i>

322
00:17:30,369 --> 00:17:34,123
<i>A person who has no regard for
wasting other people's valuable time.</i>

323
00:17:34,449 --> 00:17:36,405
<i>- Goodbye.
- Now see here, doctor-</i>

324
00:17:36,569 --> 00:17:38,366
<i>I said, goodbye.</i>

325
00:17:39,009 --> 00:17:40,158
<i>Fine.</i>

326
00:17:47,329 --> 00:17:49,559
<i>Jerry, come on, look.
Let's go to that yogurt store.</i>

327
00:17:49,729 --> 00:17:53,119
<i>I've been thinking about this. This
has gotta be a massive conspiracy.</i>

328
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:55,166
<i>Who knows how deep it goes?</i>

329
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:58,369
<i>Hey, look, wait a second.
Kramer, turn that up.</i>

330
00:17:58,769 --> 00:18:01,237
<i>Rudy Giuliani, who underwent
a physicallast week...</i>

331
00:18:01,409 --> 00:18:03,400
<i>...received some
startling news today...</i>

332
00:18:03,569 --> 00:18:07,164
<i>...when his cholesterol count
turned out to be a whopping 375.</i>

333
00:18:08,729 --> 00:18:12,358
<i>What effect this wil have on the minds
of the v oters remains to be seen.</i>

334
00:18:12,529 --> 00:18:14,804
<i>In another development,
Mayor Dinkins has fired...</i>

335
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:17,961
<i>...his top adviser, Lloyd Braun,
who was believed responsible...</i>

336
00:18:18,129 --> 00:18:19,403
<i>...for the nametag fiasco.</i>

337
00:18:19,569 --> 00:18:21,560
<i>We now tak e you
to Giuliani headquarters...</i>

338
00:18:21,729 --> 00:18:24,163
<i>...where Rudy Giuliani
is about to mak e a statement.</i>

339
00:18:24,329 --> 00:18:27,366
<i>It's hard to understand. I've been
doing everything I normaly do.</i>

340
00:18:27,529 --> 00:18:30,441
<i>I've been watching my diet very
carefuly, I exercise regularly.</i>

341
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,999
<i>My only indulgence, I guess, would be
that I eat a lot of frozen yogurt...</i>

342
00:18:34,169 --> 00:18:35,488
<i>...but it's non-fat.</i>

343
00:18:35,689 --> 00:18:41,559
<i>Non-fat yogurt? Oh, my God. They got
the Giuliani, and he doesn't know it!</i>

344
00:18:41,729 --> 00:18:44,641
<i>- Now look what you've done.
- We've gotta do something.</i>

345
00:18:44,809 --> 00:18:46,800
<i>I'm calling Giuliani's headquarters.</i>

346
00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:50,847
<i>Nametags! Nametags!</i>

347
00:18:51,009 --> 00:18:54,001
<i>What kind of an idiot thinks anybody
would be interested in that idea?</i>

348
00:18:54,169 --> 00:18:57,639
<i>I don't think it's so bad.
People should wear nametags.</i>

349
00:18:58,289 --> 00:18:59,881
<i>Everyone would be a lot friendlier.</i>

350
00:19:00,049 --> 00:19:02,688
<i>"Hello, Sam."
"How you doing, Joe?"</i>

351
00:19:04,289 --> 00:19:07,406
<i>Hey, your arm. It moved again.</i>

352
00:19:08,249 --> 00:19:09,602
<i>I thought you said it went away.</i>

353
00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:12,568
<i>I banged it on the desk
in the doctor's office.</i>

354
00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:15,438
<i>Quiet!</i>

355
00:19:15,649 --> 00:19:18,243
<i>They're starting the press conference.</i>

356
00:19:18,409 --> 00:19:21,446
<i>My campaign staff has received
some very disturbing information...</i>

357
00:19:21,609 --> 00:19:24,806
<i>...regarding the fat content in yogurt
being sold throughout the city.</i>

358
00:19:26,129 --> 00:19:28,359
<i>I pledge to you now
that if I'm elected mayor...</i>

359
00:19:28,529 --> 00:19:31,805
<i>...as my first order of business,
I'l appoint a special task force...</i>

360
00:19:31,969 --> 00:19:33,402
<i>...to investigate this matter.</i>

361
00:19:33,569 --> 00:19:35,321
<i>I promise you,
my felow New York ers...</i>

362
00:19:35,489 --> 00:19:38,128
<i>...that Mayor Giuliani
wil do everything possible...</i>

363
00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:42,077
<i>...to cleanse the city
of this falsified non-fat yogurt.</i>

364
00:19:43,129 --> 00:19:46,519
<i>The old yogurt was so much better.
Oh, this is terrible.</i>

365
00:19:46,689 --> 00:19:48,759
<i>- Oh, it stinks.
- Mine too.</i>

366
00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:50,760
<i>- I got one more day.
- I can't eat this.</i>

367
00:19:50,929 --> 00:19:52,999
<i>Hey, Jerry.</i>

368
00:19:53,769 --> 00:19:56,488
<i>Thanks a lot. I hope you're happy.</i>

369
00:19:56,649 --> 00:20:00,085
<i>- It had fat in it. It's not good for you.
- I don't care!</i>

370
00:20:00,529 --> 00:20:02,918
<i>It was good! I was enjoying it.</i>

371
00:20:03,089 --> 00:20:05,319
<i>Had to interfere,
couldn't leave well enough alone.</i>

372
00:20:05,489 --> 00:20:08,049
<i>I will get even with you for this.
You can count on it.</i>

373
00:20:08,689 --> 00:20:11,157
<i>Hey, you guys, listen to this.
Listen to this.</i>

374
00:20:11,329 --> 00:20:14,287
<i>"Apparently some blood spilled
into Mr. Giuliani's test tube...</i>

375
00:20:14,449 --> 00:20:16,121
<i>...causing his cholesterol count...</i>

376
00:20:16,289 --> 00:20:19,361
<i>...to be 150 points higher
than was initially reported.</i>

377
00:20:19,529 --> 00:20:22,521
<i>Ironically, the mishap, by bringing
the non-fat-yogurt scandal...</i>

378
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:26,602
<i>...to the attention of the public, probably
clinched the election for the Republican.</i>

379
00:20:26,769 --> 00:20:29,488
<i>It was the one issue which seemed
to electrify the voters...</i>

380
00:20:29,649 --> 00:20:31,765
<i>...and swept Giuliani into office."</i>

381
00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:34,523
<i>So in effect, the yogurt
won him the election.</i>

382
00:20:34,689 --> 00:20:36,964
<i>I wonder what actually happened
in that lab.</i>

383
00:20:37,129 --> 00:20:39,199
<i>Yeah. Me too.</i>

384
00:20:40,649 --> 00:20:42,367
<i>I can't eat this.</i>

385
00:20:47,529 --> 00:20:50,805
<i>Thanks for ruining my daddy's
business, you fat f**k.</i>

386
00:21:01,889 --> 00:21:04,528
<i>There's nothing more fun
than cursing when you're a kid.</i>

387
00:21:04,689 --> 00:21:06,645
<i>I mean, it's like getting
the keys to the car.</i>

388
00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:09,448
<i>You're doing something
you're not supposed to do.</i>

389
00:21:09,609 --> 00:21:12,203
<i>And there's nothing less fun
than when you're an adult...</i>

390
00:21:12,369 --> 00:21:14,803
<i>...and having to use
those wholesome curses:</i>

391
00:21:15,449 --> 00:21:16,723
<i>Fudge!</i>

392
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:20,247
Sugar!

393
00:21:20,729 --> 00:21:22,720
Consarnit!

394
00:21:23,329 --> 00:21:25,559
<i>What the hell is "consarnit"anyway?</i>

395
00:21:25,729 --> 00:21:27,720
<i>You stub your toe
and say, "Consarnit"...</i>

396
00:21:27,889 --> 00:21:30,198
<i>...you might as well say, "Yippee!"</i>

397
00:21:31,449 --> 00:21:34,247
<i>If you've been to a foreign country,
the first thing you learn...</i>

398
00:21:34,409 --> 00:21:35,728
<i>...are the curse words. Right?</i>

399
00:21:35,889 --> 00:21:39,564
<i>You travel halfway around the world to
experience some exotic civilization...</i>

400
00:21:39,729 --> 00:21:42,687
<i>...the first thing you ask is,
"How do they say 'doodie' here?"</i>
