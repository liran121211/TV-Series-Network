1
00:00:03,529 --> 00:00:05,884
With a serial killer,
it's safest to be a neighbour.</i>

2
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:08,922
They never kill the neighbour.
The neighbour survives to do...</i>

3
00:00:09,089 --> 00:00:11,808
...the interview afterwards, right?
"He was kind of quiet."</i>

4
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:14,119
These neighbours,
they're never disturbed...</i>

5
00:00:14,289 --> 00:00:16,598
...by the sounds of murdering.
Just stereo.</i>

6
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:18,527
Chain saws, people screaming, fine.</i>

7
00:00:18,689 --> 00:00:20,919
Just keep the music down.</i>

8
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:23,405
And women who fall in love
with the killer.</i>

9
00:00:23,569 --> 00:00:27,198
They write to him in prison. Here's
a woman that's hard to disappoint.</i>

10
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:29,167
She's only upset
when she finds out...</i>

11
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:31,399
...he's stopped killing people.
And she goes:</i>

12
00:00:31,569 --> 00:00:35,039
"You know, sometimes I feel like I don't
even know who you are anymore."</i>

13
00:00:41,049 --> 00:00:43,279
No. Eight years
isn't such a long streak.</i>

14
00:00:43,449 --> 00:00:46,600
- It isn't?
- No. I haven't vomited in 13 years.</i>

15
00:00:47,889 --> 00:00:51,802
- Get out.
- Not since June 29th, 1980.</i>

16
00:00:52,009 --> 00:00:53,681
You remember the date?</i>

17
00:00:53,889 --> 00:00:59,521
Yes. Because my previous vomit
was also June 29th, 1972.</i>

18
00:00:59,689 --> 00:01:03,079
That's why during the '80 vomit
I was yelling to George:</i>

19
00:01:03,249 --> 00:01:07,447
"Can you believe it?
I'm vomiting on June 29th again."</i>

20
00:01:07,889 --> 00:01:10,528
When Joel told me he hadn't thrown up
in eight years...</i>

21
00:01:10,689 --> 00:01:13,601
- ... I was wondering if he was normal.
- No, Elaine, he's normal.</i>

22
00:01:13,809 --> 00:01:16,323
Your boyfriend is normal.
He just has the same name...</i>

23
00:01:16,489 --> 00:01:18,719
...as one of the worst serial killers
in history.</i>

24
00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:22,559
Oh, Jer, I gotta go. I gotta go.</i>

25
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:24,287
- Hi.
- Hey.</i>

26
00:01:24,449 --> 00:01:26,326
We just saw your boyfriend
at a bus stop.</i>

27
00:01:26,529 --> 00:01:28,724
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. What's his name?</i>

28
00:01:28,929 --> 00:01:30,726
- Joel.
- Joel what?</i>

29
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:32,283
Rifkin.

30
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:36,477
- Rifkin? Joel Rifkin?
- Yeah. It's just a coincidence...</i>

31
00:01:36,649 --> 00:01:38,401
- ... obviously.
- Guess you better...</i>

32
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:40,161
...keep on his good side.</i>

33
00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:42,846
Very funny. That's very funny.</i>

34
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:46,001
Yeah, I wouldn't sleep
with my back to him if I were you.</i>

35
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:48,245
Yeah. Well, that's
enough of that. Enough.</i>

36
00:01:48,449 --> 00:01:51,009
If you smell anything
decaying in his car's trunk-</i>

37
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:53,359
Look, this is my boyfriend
we're talking about.</i>

38
00:01:53,569 --> 00:01:56,163
He's a gentleman. He's good-looking,
he's a good shaver.</i>

39
00:01:56,329 --> 00:01:59,924
And he hasn't thrown up in eight years,
so just shut up about him. Shut up!</i>

40
00:02:03,009 --> 00:02:05,648
The whole city is talking
about this monster, Joel Rifkin.</i>

41
00:02:05,809 --> 00:02:07,561
And I am dating a Joel Rifkin.</i>

42
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:12,405
- But you like your Joel Rifkin.
- Yeah. I wish he had a different name.</i>

43
00:02:12,609 --> 00:02:14,167
Ask him to change it.</i>

44
00:02:14,329 --> 00:02:16,889
You can't ask a person
to change their name.</i>

45
00:02:17,049 --> 00:02:19,279
- Why not?
- Would you change yours?</i>

46
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:21,445
If someone asked me nicely.</i>

47
00:02:22,249 --> 00:02:23,523
I'm Claude Seinfeld.</i>

48
00:02:25,169 --> 00:02:27,444
Hey, how many people
did Rifkin strangle, 18?</i>

49
00:02:27,609 --> 00:02:28,928
Yeah, 18 strangles.</i>

50
00:02:29,089 --> 00:02:31,125
You know why Rifkin
was a serial killer?</i>

51
00:02:31,289 --> 00:02:33,245
Because he was adopted.</i>

52
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:37,200
Just like Son of Sam was adopted.</i>

53
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:40,162
So apparently, adoption leads
to serial killing.</i>

54
00:02:44,009 --> 00:02:46,318
Joel and I have an extra ticket
to the Giants game.</i>

55
00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:47,922
- I'll go.
- Okay.

56
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:53,004
- I'll leave a ticket for you at will call.
- Yeah!</i>

57
00:02:55,289 --> 00:02:56,722
Should I have asked George?</i>

58
00:02:56,929 --> 00:02:59,124
Hey, did you hear George
got back with Karen?</i>

59
00:02:59,289 --> 00:03:01,041
- Karen?
- Risotto.</i>

60
00:03:01,369 --> 00:03:03,166
I feel full after the risotto.</i>

61
00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:06,879
- Oh, the risotto broad.
- Yeah.</i>

62
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:10,007
He's got a good thing with her.
I'm doubling with them tonight.</i>

63
00:03:10,529 --> 00:03:12,485
- You don't like double dates.
- George does.</i>

64
00:03:12,649 --> 00:03:14,844
He feels it's a good
personality showcase.</i>

65
00:03:15,009 --> 00:03:16,920
He likes a date to see him
with a friend...</i>

66
00:03:17,089 --> 00:03:19,523
...so she gets a window
into his non-date personality.</i>

67
00:03:19,929 --> 00:03:23,285
I've looked through that window and
screamed at him to shut the blinds.</i>

68
00:03:25,449 --> 00:03:27,167
He feels he's funnier, more relaxed.</i>

69
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:30,002
- And you're taking...?
- Jodi, the masseuse.</i>

70
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:32,279
- Hey, did you get a massage yet?
- No.</i>

71
00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:35,566
How many times do I have to go out
with her before I get a massage?</i>

72
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:39,279
Jerry, she gives massages all day. She
doesn't want to give them on dates.</i>

73
00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:42,686
Yeah, I know. She just wants
to have sex.</i>

74
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,208
So what?

75
00:03:44,369 --> 00:03:46,803
It's like going to Idaho
and eating carrots.</i>

76
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:50,724
I like carrots, but I'm in Idaho,
I want a potato.</i>

77
00:03:53,529 --> 00:03:57,363
So I go into this clothing store,
and the saleswoman is wearing this...</i>

78
00:03:57,569 --> 00:03:59,002
...low-cut thing.

79
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:01,239
So I said to her,
"Can I ask you a question?</i>

80
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:04,958
When you put on a top like that,
what's your thought process?</i>

81
00:04:05,169 --> 00:04:07,239
What's going on in your mind?"

82
00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:09,087
That is so funny.

83
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:14,246
- You listening to this?
- Yeah, I heard you.</i>

84
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:16,878
Boy, my neck is killing me.</i>

85
00:04:17,369 --> 00:04:19,678
It's right in this spot.
Very tender over here.</i>

86
00:04:19,849 --> 00:04:21,567
So, what did she say?</i>

87
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:24,806
Well, nothing.
I didn't actually say that.</i>

88
00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:27,443
You just said you said it.

89
00:04:27,609 --> 00:04:30,123
Sweetheart, I was exaggerating.</i>

90
00:04:30,329 --> 00:04:32,889
I'm learning a lot
about you tonight, George.</i>

91
00:04:33,049 --> 00:04:34,687
I've never seen you like this.</i>

92
00:04:36,369 --> 00:04:39,281
It's like somebody's
pulling on wires back here.</i>

93
00:04:39,849 --> 00:04:42,409
It's like, you never see
a really attractive woman...</i>

94
00:04:42,569 --> 00:04:44,161
...getting a traffic ticket.</i>

95
00:04:44,329 --> 00:04:47,685
How can you say that?
My sister got a ticket last week.</i>

96
00:04:47,849 --> 00:04:50,488
Are you saying she's not attractive?</i>

97
00:04:50,929 --> 00:04:53,602
Obviously, these are not
hard-and-fast rules.</i>

98
00:04:53,809 --> 00:04:56,243
Darling, the tea is getting
a little cold, sweetheart.</i>

99
00:04:56,449 --> 00:04:58,405
- Can we go?
- So soon?</i>

100
00:04:58,569 --> 00:05:00,878
- Yeah. Good seeing you again, Karen.
- Yeah.</i>

101
00:05:01,089 --> 00:05:04,047
- Nice meeting you, Karen.
- Yeah, I'll call about that massage.</i>

102
00:05:04,249 --> 00:05:05,728
- Yeah.
- Let's do this again soon.</i>

103
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,686
Yeah.</i>

104
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:14,997
- I strained my neck last night.
- Really, how?</i>

105
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:17,603
I tried brushing my teeth
by holding the brush...</i>

106
00:05:17,769 --> 00:05:20,283
...and moving my head
from side to side.</i>

107
00:05:20,929 --> 00:05:22,362
It didn't work.

108
00:05:22,729 --> 00:05:25,323
So, what's the deal
with your friend George?</i>

109
00:05:25,489 --> 00:05:26,842
No deal. Why?</i>

110
00:05:27,009 --> 00:05:30,126
What was all that "attractive women
not getting tickets"nonsense?</i>

111
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:33,526
Well, he was just showcasing
his non-date personality.</i>

112
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:36,127
How can you hang out with him?

113
00:05:36,289 --> 00:05:39,599
Yeah, sometimes
it really makes me tense.</i>

114
00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:42,805
Did you see
the way that he was eating?</i>

115
00:05:42,969 --> 00:05:44,880
Yeah, he's disgusting.</i>

116
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:48,198
I have to tell you,
I really don't like him.</i>

117
00:05:48,369 --> 00:05:51,247
- Yeah, me either.
- It's just I hate that type.</i>

118
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:53,206
He's a bad seed.</i>

119
00:05:55,169 --> 00:05:58,320
Now, you, however, you, I like.</i>

120
00:05:58,849 --> 00:06:03,001
- What are you doing?
- What do you think I'm doing?</i>

121
00:06:05,769 --> 00:06:09,045
- So, what do you think?
- Really enjoyed it.</i>

122
00:06:09,249 --> 00:06:11,001
- Jodi's nice.
- She's very nice.</i>

123
00:06:11,649 --> 00:06:13,799
Let's discuss this later.</i>

124
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:16,398
You think she liked me?
She seemed to like me.</i>

125
00:06:17,249 --> 00:06:22,118
- I was personable, don't you think?
- You were extremely personable.</i>

126
00:06:22,329 --> 00:06:25,082
Because I thought I picked up
a little something.</i>

127
00:06:25,249 --> 00:06:27,809
I'm very good at this.
Did you pick up anything?</i>

128
00:06:28,009 --> 00:06:32,446
- I didn't pick up anything.
- The second time I sent noodles back...</i>

129
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:35,127
...I thought she made a face.</i>

130
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:36,962
I didn't see a face.</i>

131
00:06:38,209 --> 00:06:39,801
I thought I saw a face.</i>

132
00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:42,722
- What is the difference?
- No difference. I could care less.</i>

133
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:46,643
- She's Jerry's girlfriend.
- George, instead of talking about this...</i>

134
00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:48,840
...we could be... You know.</i>

135
00:06:50,929 --> 00:06:52,521
So you think she liked me?</i>

136
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:03,122
- What are you doing?
- Massaging your neck.</i>

137
00:07:06,489 --> 00:07:09,367
Of course. Massaging.</i>

138
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:11,442
Boning up on football?

139
00:07:11,649 --> 00:07:14,004
Yeah. Yeah. You know what?</i>

140
00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:17,764
There are a lot of players
named Deion these days.</i>

141
00:07:18,249 --> 00:07:20,638
What a cool name, Deion.</i>

142
00:07:20,809 --> 00:07:23,243
If I were gonna change my name,
I'd go with Deion.</i>

143
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:26,086
Deion Benes?</i>

144
00:07:26,289 --> 00:07:27,927
Well, as a woman, it makes no sense.</i>

145
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,758
But I mean...
Well, let's say I was you.</i>

146
00:07:31,929 --> 00:07:34,079
And I decided I was gonna
change my name-</i>

147
00:07:34,249 --> 00:07:36,524
For no real reason whatsoever.</i>

148
00:07:36,809 --> 00:07:39,198
Deion Rifkin.</i>

149
00:07:40,969 --> 00:07:43,881
That is so cool.

150
00:07:45,209 --> 00:07:46,608
Deion Rifkin?</i>

151
00:07:47,369 --> 00:07:49,166
Well, maybe you're not
the Deion type.</i>

152
00:07:49,329 --> 00:07:53,720
Okay, then let's see, let's see,
what do we got? Oh, oh, oh, O.J.</i>

153
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:57,484
O.J. Rifkin. Oh, you don't even use
a name. It's just initials.</i>

154
00:07:57,689 --> 00:08:00,726
Oh, please, please, change your name
to O.J. It would be so great.</i>

155
00:08:00,929 --> 00:08:03,159
Elaine, what is going on?</i>

156
00:08:06,409 --> 00:08:09,685
- She stayed over?
- Yeah.</i>

157
00:08:10,129 --> 00:08:14,008
- Sex wasn't so good?
- No. Sex was fabulous.</i>

158
00:08:14,649 --> 00:08:18,358
- So?
- I want the massage.</i>

159
00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:21,400
- Did you ask her?
- I put her hands there.</i>

160
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:24,208
She just pulls it away immediately.
She's not into it.</i>

161
00:08:24,409 --> 00:08:26,843
- Why not?
- I guess because it's her job.</i>

162
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:29,477
It's very frustrating.</i>

163
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:33,401
So we had a good time,
the four of us.</i>

164
00:08:33,569 --> 00:08:35,127
- Yeah.
- We all got along.</i>

165
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:37,678
- Everyone seemed very pleasant.
- Yeah.</i>

166
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:40,323
- What did Jodi say?
- She had a good time.</i>

167
00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:42,326
- Is that it?
- Pretty much.</i>

168
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:46,486
She say anything about...?</i>

169
00:08:46,689 --> 00:08:48,884
- What?
- No, no. It's all right. Great.</i>

170
00:08:49,049 --> 00:08:50,368
She had a good time.</i>

171
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:53,445
Yeah.</i>

172
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:55,844
- You hesitated.
- I was blowing on the coffee.</i>

173
00:08:56,049 --> 00:08:57,721
She didn't like me.</i>

174
00:08:58,969 --> 00:09:01,563
It's not like you'll be spending
a lot of time with her.</i>

175
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:03,088
So she doesn't like me?</i>

176
00:09:03,289 --> 00:09:05,200
No.

177
00:09:07,409 --> 00:09:09,240
- She said that?
- Yes.</i>

178
00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:12,439
- She told you she doesn't like me?
- Yes.</i>

179
00:09:12,809 --> 00:09:15,164
- What were her exact-?
- "I don't like him."</i>

180
00:09:20,449 --> 00:09:21,768
Why didn't she like me?</i>

181
00:09:21,969 --> 00:09:24,164
- Not everybody likes everybody.
- I wasn't nice?</i>

182
00:09:24,369 --> 00:09:27,566
- You were very nice.
- I bent over backwards for that woman!</i>

183
00:09:27,729 --> 00:09:31,005
- Was it what I said about her sister?
- It has nothing to do with her.</i>

184
00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:34,007
I don't even know her sister!
But if she's getting tickets...</i>

185
00:09:34,169 --> 00:09:36,319
...she's not that good-looking!</i>

186
00:09:38,449 --> 00:09:40,041
You vomited in 1987.</i>

187
00:09:40,209 --> 00:09:42,006
Oh, no. That was the dry heaves.</i>

188
00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:43,961
- Jodi.
- Hi, Jerry.</i>

189
00:09:44,129 --> 00:09:48,247
- Hey!
- What are you doing here?</i>

190
00:09:48,449 --> 00:09:51,805
- I was giving Kramer a massage.
- Kramer.</i>

191
00:09:53,289 --> 00:09:54,768
Gotta run, I have an appointment.</i>

192
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:56,647
- Let me take your table.
- That's okay.</i>

193
00:09:56,809 --> 00:09:58,208
Please. I love to help people.</i>

194
00:09:58,369 --> 00:10:01,805
This is what I do.
Come on, I'm going this way.</i>

195
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:03,527
I'll see you tonight.</i>

196
00:10:06,249 --> 00:10:09,241
Hey! I am looser than creamed corn.</i>

197
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:12,287
Who told you to get a massage?
I haven't gotten one from her!</i>

198
00:10:12,449 --> 00:10:15,759
Oh, you don't know
what you're missing, buddy.</i>

199
00:10:15,969 --> 00:10:17,846
No one hails a cab like me.</i>

200
00:10:18,009 --> 00:10:19,840
My hailing technique is unmatched.</i>

201
00:10:20,009 --> 00:10:22,000
See, I get the wrist going
side to side and:</i>

202
00:10:22,169 --> 00:10:24,888
Cabs are crashing into themselves
to just pick me up.</i>

203
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:28,041
All right, here we go.
Let me get the door.</i>

204
00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:30,769
Feminists aside,
I know women like the door-holding.</i>

205
00:10:30,929 --> 00:10:34,319
Here we are. Alrighty. Good. Okay.</i>

206
00:10:34,489 --> 00:10:36,002
Let's get together again soon.</i>

207
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:38,285
- Say hello to your sister.
- You've never met.</i>

208
00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:42,362
Whatever. If I wasn't involved right
now, I wouldn't mind being set up.</i>

209
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:45,566
Something tells me she's a knockout!</i>

210
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:47,680
But first, she sets
the mood perfectly...</i>

211
00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:51,723
...with this New Age music
played over ocean sounds.</i>

212
00:10:51,889 --> 00:10:53,959
Then she lays you out on this table.</i>

213
00:10:54,489 --> 00:10:59,847
And she proceeds to rub oil
over your entire body.</i>

214
00:11:00,049 --> 00:11:03,758
And she rubs long and deep.</i>

215
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:06,363
Jerry, she rubs with love.</i>

216
00:11:08,129 --> 00:11:12,884
Every muscle she touches
just oozes...</i>

217
00:11:13,449 --> 00:11:15,644
...beneath those silky, soft fingers.</i>

218
00:11:16,329 --> 00:11:18,524
You can scarcely
contain yourself, buddy.</i>

219
00:11:18,689 --> 00:11:20,645
- So you had a good time, huh?
- Oh, yeah.</i>

220
00:11:20,809 --> 00:11:23,004
- Enjoyed yourself?
- Very much.</i>

221
00:11:23,169 --> 00:11:26,206
All right, now, you listen,
and you listen good!</i>

222
00:11:26,609 --> 00:11:28,008
- What?
- The massages are out!</i>

223
00:11:28,169 --> 00:11:30,239
- What-?
- They're out!</i>

224
00:11:30,409 --> 00:11:33,207
- Why?
- If I can't get one, you're not!</i>

225
00:11:33,409 --> 00:11:37,322
Wait a minute. I need my massages.
Can't you see I'm burned out?</i>

226
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:45,560
- I'm sorry, Kramer.
- Why, why? Look, I paid for her!</i>

227
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:49,004
Don't you ever
talk about her like that!</i>

228
00:11:49,169 --> 00:11:52,684
- Yeah, but why?!
- Final!</i>

229
00:11:55,729 --> 00:11:58,607
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Giants Stadium.</i>

230
00:11:58,809 --> 00:12:01,084
- Oh, you have photos in your wallet?
- Yeah.</i>

231
00:12:01,249 --> 00:12:04,047
- Why, is that weird?
- No, it's normal.</i>

232
00:12:04,249 --> 00:12:08,481
You're very normal.
You're totally normal.</i>

233
00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:13,281
- Who's this?
- That's my mother.</i>

234
00:12:13,569 --> 00:12:15,560
Oh, yeah. I see the resemblance.</i>

235
00:12:15,729 --> 00:12:18,527
- No, there's no resemblance.
- Yeah, there is. Right here-</i>

236
00:12:18,689 --> 00:12:20,839
Elaine, I was adopted.</i>

237
00:12:21,649 --> 00:12:24,482
Oh, that's nice.</i>

238
00:12:24,689 --> 00:12:28,602
Oh, the game's about to start.
I wonder where your friend Kramer is.</i>

239
00:12:32,929 --> 00:12:35,568
Yeah, a ticket for Kramer?</i>

240
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:39,479
- Here it is. I need some ID.
- Oh, yeah.</i>

241
00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:46,959
- You know, I forgot my wallet.
- Well, I can't give it to you then.</i>

242
00:12:47,329 --> 00:12:49,843
- Are you kidding me?
- I'm afraid not.</i>

243
00:12:50,049 --> 00:12:54,247
Come on, just look at me.
Now tell me I'm not Kramer.</i>

244
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:58,567
- I'm sorry. I need proof.
- Look, I'll drive out here tomorrow...</i>

245
00:12:58,729 --> 00:13:00,128
...and I'll show you the ID.</i>

246
00:13:00,289 --> 00:13:02,120
I got nothing to do all day.

247
00:13:02,329 --> 00:13:04,638
Neither do I.</i>

248
00:13:04,809 --> 00:13:06,606
But without ID...

249
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:09,681
...I need confirmation
from the person who left the ticket.</i>

250
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,039
Where's a phone?</i>

251
00:13:13,369 --> 00:13:17,726
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention, please.</i>

252
00:13:18,169 --> 00:13:22,447
Would Joel Rifkin
report to the stadium office.</i>

253
00:13:22,609 --> 00:13:25,681
Joel Rifkin, telephone.</i>

254
00:13:25,969 --> 00:13:28,688
Who would be calling me here?</i>

255
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:32,237
He's not the murderer.</i>

256
00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:42,209
Oh, God.

257
00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:46,121
- What's the matter with you?
- Jerry, I need another massage.</i>

258
00:13:46,329 --> 00:13:48,604
You just had one.
What do you need another one for?</i>

259
00:13:48,809 --> 00:13:51,369
Because of the Giant game.
I told you, it went overtime.</i>

260
00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:53,918
You know those seats.
They're very unforgiving.</i>

261
00:13:54,129 --> 00:13:56,848
- Oh, please.
- And then the game-winning field goal...</i>

262
00:13:57,009 --> 00:14:01,924
...went over the net and into the crowd,
and I dove over three rows.</i>

263
00:14:02,129 --> 00:14:04,245
My back, it's killing me.</i>

264
00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:06,999
It's killing me, Jerry!</i>

265
00:14:07,289 --> 00:14:10,725
- Well, did you get the ball?
- Oh, I got the ball.</i>

266
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:13,005
I never caught a foul ball
at a baseball game.</i>

267
00:14:13,209 --> 00:14:15,643
Well, it's quite a thrill.</i>

268
00:14:15,809 --> 00:14:18,721
- Well, get somebody else.
- Nobody does it like she does.</i>

269
00:14:18,889 --> 00:14:20,959
- She's the best.
- Tonight's the night.</i>

270
00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:23,438
I'm getting one. No ifs, ands or buts.</i>

271
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:27,642
- Well, what about my massage?
- Ask Newman.</i>

272
00:14:30,809 --> 00:14:33,562
So I lugged that table,
that big, heavy massage table...</i>

273
00:14:33,729 --> 00:14:35,401
...all the way down to the cab!</i>

274
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:38,887
- You ever see one of those things?
- Of course.</i>

275
00:14:39,409 --> 00:14:41,286
Well, I don't know.
Maybe you haven't.</i>

276
00:14:41,449 --> 00:14:43,644
You know. Not everybody's seen
a massage table.</i>

277
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:45,441
You think I've never had a massage?</i>

278
00:14:45,649 --> 00:14:48,925
Anyway, I don't even get a thank you.
I don't get it.</i>

279
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:52,166
George, frankly, I'm getting
a little tired of hearing about her.</i>

280
00:14:52,369 --> 00:14:54,405
I wanna know what I did
to this woman.

281
00:14:54,649 --> 00:14:56,321
You got a little thing for her?</i>

282
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:59,726
No, no. She's going out
with a friend of mine.</i>

283
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:02,244
It's only courteous
to try and like each other.</i>

284
00:15:02,449 --> 00:15:05,043
What's the difference?
Who cares if she doesn't like you.</i>

285
00:15:05,209 --> 00:15:07,245
Does everybody in the world
have to like you?</i>

286
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:11,647
Yes. Yes. Everybody has to like me.
I must be liked.</i>

287
00:15:14,169 --> 00:15:18,321
Of course I support your decision
to change your name.</i>

288
00:15:18,889 --> 00:15:24,009
After the Giant game, I realized
that this problem isn't going away.</i>

289
00:15:24,289 --> 00:15:26,120
Well, listen, I just want you to know...</i>

290
00:15:26,289 --> 00:15:29,565
...that I was more than willing
to stick it out with Joel Rifkin.</i>

291
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:32,329
Sure.</i>

292
00:15:34,249 --> 00:15:36,604
- Okay, you got your list?
- Yeah, yeah. Ten names.</i>

293
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,078
- Great.
- Okay, and if somebody objects...</i>

294
00:15:39,249 --> 00:15:40,682
- ... you can just veto it.
- Okay.</i>

295
00:15:40,849 --> 00:15:43,886
Okay, you start.
What's your first choice?</i>

296
00:15:44,489 --> 00:15:46,525
- Stuart.
- No. Second choice.</i>

297
00:15:47,609 --> 00:15:49,088
Stuart's no good?

298
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:52,925
I have never met a normal guy
named Stuart.</i>

299
00:15:53,489 --> 00:15:57,801
Okay. My second choice is Todd.</i>

300
00:15:58,449 --> 00:16:00,644
Todd.

301
00:16:00,929 --> 00:16:02,487
No. Veto.</i>

302
00:16:02,689 --> 00:16:04,327
All right.

303
00:16:04,929 --> 00:16:07,159
Hey, I think you're gonna like
my third choice.</i>

304
00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:09,365
- Oh, great.
- Alex.</i>

305
00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:14,928
I gotta tell you, I have
a bad association with the name Alex.</i>

306
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:19,361
- Bad association?
- In college, I sat next to an Alex...</i>

307
00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:21,565
...in art history.
He always drank coffee...</i>

308
00:16:21,729 --> 00:16:24,118
...and after every sip, he would go:</i>

309
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:28,924
I mean, every two seconds:</i>

310
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:32,047
And he would take, like, 40 sips,
and after every one:</i>

311
00:16:33,169 --> 00:16:34,841
I had to drop the class.</i>

312
00:16:37,689 --> 00:16:39,247
- Hey.
- Hi.</i>

313
00:16:39,409 --> 00:16:41,639
I was running late,
and I didn't have a chance...</i>

314
00:16:41,809 --> 00:16:43,765
...to drop off my stuff
before I came over.</i>

315
00:16:43,929 --> 00:16:45,726
Oh, no problem. That's fine.</i>

316
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:48,206
What's with this music?

317
00:16:48,369 --> 00:16:50,803
It's New Age music.</i>

318
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:53,085
Sounds of the forest.</i>

319
00:16:53,249 --> 00:16:54,648
I find it soothing.

320
00:16:56,009 --> 00:16:58,364
Look at this. What do you know?
A massage table.</i>

321
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:01,158
This is great.</i>

322
00:17:01,329 --> 00:17:04,002
- What are you doing?
- Just checking it out.</i>

323
00:17:04,169 --> 00:17:06,444
Look at how this thing is made.</i>

324
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:09,919
Can I tell you something?
That's a hell of a piece of equipment.</i>

325
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:15,442
- Actually, I should get a new one.
- Nonsense. This one's fine.</i>

326
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:19,284
- So where do you wanna go?
- Go? Why go anywhere?</i>

327
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:22,725
That feels good.</i>

328
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:25,638
Yeah, that's...</i>

329
00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:27,959
That's good.

330
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:37,328
Yeah, that's nice.
That's very nice.</i>

331
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:40,401
No. No, this isn't good.
I can't do this.

332
00:17:40,569 --> 00:17:42,161
Why? What's wrong?

333
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:44,718
- I can't.
- No. Yes, you can.</i>

334
00:17:44,889 --> 00:17:47,039
- No, I can't.
- Yes. Come on, I know...</i>

335
00:17:47,209 --> 00:17:48,642
...it's something you wanna do.</i>

336
00:17:54,729 --> 00:17:56,447
You know what?

337
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,208
I should go talk to her.</i>

338
00:17:58,729 --> 00:18:01,323
Nothing confrontational.
Just two adults sitting down...

339
00:18:01,489 --> 00:18:02,842
...trying to clear the air.</i>

340
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:05,558
I know if I could spend
some time alone with her...</i>

341
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:08,364
- I've got to. I've got to.
- You're going now?</i>

342
00:18:08,529 --> 00:18:10,201
Well, I think I can still catch her.</i>

343
00:18:10,449 --> 00:18:13,122
All right, George, I have had
just about enough of this.</i>

344
00:18:13,329 --> 00:18:16,480
- What are you talking about?
- I am talking about you and Jodi.</i>

345
00:18:16,649 --> 00:18:18,526
You're completely obsessed with her.</i>

346
00:18:19,129 --> 00:18:21,518
I know. I know.

347
00:18:21,849 --> 00:18:23,965
Who is more important to you,
her or me?</i>

348
00:18:24,129 --> 00:18:27,439
I like you, she doesn't.
Who you gonna pick?</i>

349
00:18:33,249 --> 00:18:34,841
I'm sorry, Karen. I care for you...</i>

350
00:18:35,009 --> 00:18:37,318
...but I can't stand
when someone doesn't like me.</i>

351
00:18:37,529 --> 00:18:41,442
- Well, now I hate you!
- That, I'm used to.</i>

352
00:18:42,129 --> 00:18:44,689
- Ned?
- What is wrong with Ned?</i>

353
00:18:46,089 --> 00:18:50,924
Ned's a guy who buys
irregular underwear. Next.</i>

354
00:18:52,849 --> 00:18:56,285
- Ellis.
- Ellis? You might as well go with Alex.</i>

355
00:18:56,449 --> 00:19:00,203
- It's the same thing.
- Ellis and Alex aren't even close.</i>

356
00:19:00,409 --> 00:19:02,604
- Next!
- Oh, what's the point?</i>

357
00:19:02,769 --> 00:19:06,648
- Now, no, come on!
- Okay. Okay.</i>

358
00:19:07,409 --> 00:19:09,923
Remy.</i>

359
00:19:11,369 --> 00:19:13,325
Remy Rifkin?</i>

360
00:19:13,489 --> 00:19:16,049
Should I get a beret?</i>

361
00:19:16,569 --> 00:19:18,685
Oh, Stuart's a lot better.</i>

362
00:19:18,849 --> 00:19:22,478
Little Stuart Rifkin
likes to go shopping with his mother.</i>

363
00:19:25,769 --> 00:19:27,202
What do you mean, no?</i>

364
00:19:27,409 --> 00:19:28,922
No means no.</i>

365
00:19:29,129 --> 00:19:31,120
Who you kidding?
You come to my apartment...</i>

366
00:19:31,289 --> 00:19:35,521
...with your table and your little oils.
I'm not supposed to expect anything?</i>

367
00:19:35,889 --> 00:19:37,845
You're a massage teaser.</i>

368
00:19:39,529 --> 00:19:42,327
Listen, I massage who I want
when I want.</i>

369
00:19:42,489 --> 00:19:45,481
I don't submit to forcible massage.</i>

370
00:19:50,729 --> 00:19:53,880
- I'm getting out of here.
- Fine, go.</i>

371
00:20:02,889 --> 00:20:05,278
Jerry, could you excuse us
for a few minutes, please?</i>

372
00:20:05,449 --> 00:20:08,009
- What for?
- We need to talk.</i>

373
00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:10,364
- You need to talk?
- We have nothing to talk about.</i>

374
00:20:10,569 --> 00:20:13,163
Look, it's no secret
what's going on between us.</i>

375
00:20:13,729 --> 00:20:16,243
She doesn't like me.
Now, Jerry, if you don't mind...</i>

376
00:20:16,409 --> 00:20:20,243
George, anything you have to say
to her, you can say in front of me.</i>

377
00:20:23,649 --> 00:20:25,560
Jerry...</i>

378
00:20:25,729 --> 00:20:28,687
...this woman hates me so much...</i>

379
00:20:28,849 --> 00:20:31,158
...I'm starting to like her.</i>

380
00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:35,239
- What?
- She just dislikes me so much...</i>

381
00:20:35,889 --> 00:20:38,483
...it's irresistible.</i>

382
00:20:38,689 --> 00:20:41,886
- I can see that.
- I'm getting out of here.</i>

383
00:20:42,329 --> 00:20:45,207
- Don't call me.
- Don't worry.</i>

384
00:20:46,769 --> 00:20:50,808
A woman that hates me this much
comes along once in a lifetime.</i>

385
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:54,245
You're a lucky guy.</i>

386
00:20:54,529 --> 00:20:56,201
I gotta go after her.</i>

387
00:20:56,369 --> 00:20:57,722
George.</i>

388
00:20:58,449 --> 00:21:00,440
I wouldn't push for the massage.</i>

389
00:21:02,369 --> 00:21:04,121
Jodi!

390
00:21:13,049 --> 00:21:16,678
Swedes are big massagers. They like
Swedish meatballs, Swedish massage.</i>

391
00:21:16,849 --> 00:21:19,647
They like having meat in their hands,
these people.</i>

392
00:21:19,809 --> 00:21:21,959
But it's weird.
They have a high suicide rate.</i>

393
00:21:22,129 --> 00:21:24,040
They're always rubbing
each other's necks.</i>

394
00:21:24,209 --> 00:21:26,359
For a neutral country,
they seem kind of tense.</i>

395
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:29,559
I don't like the idea of
a professional massage.</i>

396
00:21:29,769 --> 00:21:33,159
I don't want people touching me
that don't wanna have sex with me.</i>

397
00:21:33,329 --> 00:21:35,968
You get me all loosened up,
juices flowing, then:</i>

398
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:39,246
"That's it. Okay, you're done."</i>

399
00:21:39,449 --> 00:21:41,519
Like having chocolate
rubbed over your face.</i>

400
00:21:41,689 --> 00:21:45,762
You wanna go, "Excuse me.
I think you missed a spot."</i>

401
00:21:53,289 --> 00:21:55,280
