George locks his keys in his car and leaves it in the Yankees parking lot. Elaine, out of spite, buys Sue Ellen a bra for a birthday gift as she has never worn one. George, having successfully convinced Wilhelm and Steinbrenner that he's putting in extra hours, decides to skip town with Susan after learning that her father rebuilt the cabin. So George asks Kramer and Jerry to go to Yankee Stadium and take the fliers off of his car. The car is really dirty, and Jerry and Kramer decide to go take it to the car wash. But along the way, they see Sue Ellen wearing the bra as a top. Jerry and Kramer get distracted and crash George's car. They return the damaged car back to Yankee Stadium. Steinbrenner, having seen the damage, and with George nowhere in sight, thinks George is dead. Kramer injures his arm in the accident, and his golf game is ruined. Elaine decides that Sue Ellen is a menace to society, and Kramer hires smooth-talking attorney Jackie Chiles to represent them. Unfortunately, the trial is jeopardized when Kramer asks Stan The Caddy for advice.\u2014halo1k", "Elaine plots a little revenge against old nemesis Sue Ellen Mishckie who many years before had lured Elaine's boyfriend away by going bra-less.
