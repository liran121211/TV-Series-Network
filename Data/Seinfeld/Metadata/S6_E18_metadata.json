Elaine asks Jimmy to go to the benefit for the Able Mentally Challenged Adults organization starring Mel Torme. Thanks to Jimmy's shoes and getting too much Novocaine at Whatley's office, Kramer is mistaken for a mentally challenged man when he encounters the head of the AMCA. Jerry suspects Tim Whatley and his assistant are using patients for sexual pleasures when he finds pornographic magazines in Whatley's waiting room and thinks that he was violated while under the gas. George cuts a deal with Jimmy to sell Jimmy's shoes, but Jimmy gets injured thanks to Kramer's drooling. The deal, plus some spicy chicken, also helps Wilhelm accuse George of stealing some of the Yankee's batting equipment.\u2014halo1k", "George and Jerry are more than just a bit annoyed with basketball-playing acquaintance Jimmy who is always referring to himself in the third person such as 'Jimmy had a good game today' or \"Jimmy likes...' this or that. It all leads to Elaine ending up on a date with him. It also leads George to try and make a buck selling basketball shoes similar to those Jimmy plays in. Jerry begins to wonder just what his dentist Tim Whately is really up to when he finds a Penthouse magazine in the waiting room. Kramer meanwhile finds himself getting a seat at the head table of a major fund-raiser for the mentally handicapped after his own dental appointment.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0697714", "rating": 8.9, "votes": 4894, "number_of_episodes": 172}
