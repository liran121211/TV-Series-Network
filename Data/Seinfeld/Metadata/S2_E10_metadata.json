Kramer meanwhile has been after Jerry to get an illegal cable hook-up from his Russian friends. Jerry reluctantly agrees - but he has visions of the FBI descending upon him. When Jerry returns home unexpectedly after bad weather cancels his trip, he arrives in the middle of the baby shower as do the oafish Russians to install the cable.
