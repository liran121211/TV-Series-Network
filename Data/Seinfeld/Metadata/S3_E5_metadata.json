He's certain he returned it - a copy of Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer - but the library's chief investigator, a no-nonsense tough guy right out of a bad Hollywood movie, doesn't want to hear excuses. George is shaken when he goes to the library with Jerry only to see a homeless man on the step who is the spitting image of his high school tormentor, gym teacher Mr. Heyman. It was George's complaint that got the man fired and he now thinks he may have ruined his life. Kramer meanwhile starts dating the librarian and Elaine is convinced that her boss is out to fire her.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0697721", "rating": 8.5, "votes": 5577, "number_of_episodes": 172}
