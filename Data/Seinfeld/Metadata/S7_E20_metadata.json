She gets into a bidding war with her long-time rival Sue Ellen but eventually wins, paying double the price Peterman had authorized. After Kramer and Newman borrow his car, Jerry has to take it into his temperamental mechanic Tony who takes off with the car - that still has the JFK clubs on the backseat. At work, George is given a special project by his boss Wilhem but he hasn't a clue what it's about and he's afraid to ask him what he wants. George later learns that he's done a great job on the project - but he has no idea who did it or what it was about.
