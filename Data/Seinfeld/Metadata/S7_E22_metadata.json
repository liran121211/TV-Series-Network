George doesn't think he can go through with the wedding. But when Susan puts George in charge of the wedding invitations, George gets the cheapest ones in the lot, knowing that the glue for the envelopes is cheap. Unfortunately for Susan, the glue is also toxic and licking the envelopes has fatal consequences. Meanwhile, Jerry courts a woman just like him named Jeannie Steinman and holds up his end of George's \"pact\" (see episode \"The Engagement\").\u2014Anonymous", "George is as his wits end - his wedding day is approaching and he just knows he'll be unhappy for the rest of his life if he goes ahead with it.
