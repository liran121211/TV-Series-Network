Kramer helps solve a parking ticket mystery.", "When George learns that their friend Gary never had cancer as he claimed, he promises to keep it secret from Jerry--of course, George can keep a secret for about two seconds. Elaine gets all tied up in knots when she learns that someone said hi to her ex-boyfriend on her behalf. She goes out of her way to let him know otherwise, which seems to defeat the purpose.
