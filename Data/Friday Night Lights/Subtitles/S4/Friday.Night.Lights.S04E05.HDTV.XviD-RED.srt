1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,143
- Give me my wallet back.
- Oh!

2
00:00:01,177 --> 00:00:03,512
[police sirens]

3
00:00:03,546 --> 00:00:05,313
- We are at
a crossroads right now.

4
00:00:05,348 --> 00:00:08,150
You are gonna cut
the tough guy crap.

5
00:00:08,184 --> 00:00:10,719
- My mother never took me
shopping for a pageant gown,

6
00:00:10,753 --> 00:00:12,053
And because of that

7
00:00:12,088 --> 00:00:14,456
I never placed at miss texas.

8
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:15,657
- [chuckles]

9
00:00:16,091 --> 00:00:19,294
- Mrs. Saracen?
- [sobbing]

10
00:00:19,328 --> 00:00:21,963
- It's your dad.

11
00:00:21,997 --> 00:00:23,565
He was killed.

12
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:26,835
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:29,104 --> 00:00:31,773
- It's late in the game
here at east dillon, folks.

14
00:00:31,807 --> 00:00:34,642
And once again, the lions
are going gently

15
00:00:34,677 --> 00:00:36,144
Into that good night.
- You understand me?

16
00:00:36,178 --> 00:00:37,946
All right, let's get some points
out of this thing.

17
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,647
- Hey, water! Let's go!

18
00:00:39,682 --> 00:00:41,082
- Down 24,

19
00:00:41,116 --> 00:00:42,851
Another short gain
for east dillon.

20
00:00:42,885 --> 00:00:44,586
- They know what we're
gonna do before we do it.

21
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:45,820
- What do you want me to do?

22
00:00:45,855 --> 00:00:47,822
- Let's run wildcat.

23
00:00:47,857 --> 00:00:49,357
- No, no, no.
Coach said we ain't ready.

24
00:00:49,391 --> 00:00:50,959
- I'm ready, all right?

25
00:00:50,993 --> 00:00:52,694
Let's go out there and get
some of our pride back,

26
00:00:52,728 --> 00:00:54,362
Some dignity.

27
00:00:54,396 --> 00:00:56,097
- All right, he's gonna kick
our asses all over the state.

28
00:00:56,131 --> 00:00:58,433
I hope you know that.
- Yeah, coach can't catch me.

29
00:00:58,467 --> 00:01:00,501
- Hey!

30
00:01:04,039 --> 00:01:05,306
- All right, guys,
we're gonna go with right--

31
00:01:05,341 --> 00:01:06,875
- Nah, nah, nah,
new play, new play.

32
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:08,977
All right, we're gonna go with
spread texas "a," skinny max.

33
00:01:09,011 --> 00:01:10,178
- That's not what coach said.

34
00:01:10,212 --> 00:01:11,746
- Shut up. You get your ass
out to "x"

35
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,981
And make some blocks,
all right?

36
00:01:13,015 --> 00:01:14,549
Listen, we're going
option right, all right?

37
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:16,551
On one, on one.

38
00:01:16,585 --> 00:01:17,819
Ready?
All: Break!

39
00:01:17,853 --> 00:01:20,388
âª âª

40
00:01:20,422 --> 00:01:22,190
- Look at this.

41
00:01:22,224 --> 00:01:24,659
Coach taylor's come out
in a texas spread, ace set.

42
00:01:24,693 --> 00:01:26,394
Cafferty to the outside.

43
00:01:26,428 --> 00:01:27,528
- What are you doing?

44
00:01:27,563 --> 00:01:28,663
- Here we go.
This could be fun, folks.

45
00:01:28,697 --> 00:01:30,131
- It's cafferty
on the counter.

46
00:01:30,165 --> 00:01:31,699
He cuts inside.

47
00:01:31,734 --> 00:01:35,837
Oh, wait a second, folks!
It's a pitch to vince howard.

48
00:01:35,871 --> 00:01:38,373
Oh, and he smokes the safety!

49
00:01:38,407 --> 00:01:41,075
One man to beat.
Oh, my! What a move!

50
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,710
Howard taking it to the barn,
folks.

51
00:01:42,745 --> 00:01:44,512
Touchdown east dillon.

52
00:01:44,546 --> 00:01:47,181
Touchdown dillon!

53
00:01:47,216 --> 00:01:49,584

âª âª

55
00:01:54,356 --> 00:01:56,090
- My goodness!
Vince howard absolutely mudholed

56
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:57,592
The free safety.

57
00:01:57,626 --> 00:01:59,260
- Good call, coach!

58
00:01:59,295 --> 00:02:02,463
- 54 yards--the best run
from scrimmage all season,

59
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:05,566
And a hell of a read
from luke cafferty.

60
00:02:08,771 --> 00:02:09,904
- Come here!

61
00:02:09,939 --> 00:02:11,105
Come here!
Who called that?

62
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,774
Who called that play?
- It happened so fast.

63
00:02:12,808 --> 00:02:15,043
- Who called the play?
- I blacked out, coach.

64
00:02:15,077 --> 00:02:16,911
- Who called the play?
Cafferty, who called the play?

65
00:02:16,946 --> 00:02:19,213
- I don't know
who called the play.

66
00:02:19,248 --> 00:02:20,715
- Who called the play?

67
00:02:20,749 --> 00:02:23,051
- Get out there on kickoff.
Get out there. Let's go!

68
00:02:26,255 --> 00:02:27,422
[cheers and applause]

69
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:29,624
- You want to get
some more of that?

70
00:02:29,658 --> 00:02:32,360
- Yeah.

71
00:02:32,394 --> 00:02:35,863
- If you want some more of that,
get the damn ball back.

72
00:02:35,898 --> 00:02:38,099
- 41. Number?

73
00:02:38,133 --> 00:02:41,035
- 4-3.
- 4-3?

74
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,571
- [shouting plays]

75
00:02:43,605 --> 00:02:45,540
Hike!

76
00:02:45,574 --> 00:02:46,908
- South pines
back to pass.

77
00:02:46,942 --> 00:02:49,711
Vince howard coming off the edge
on the speed rush.

78
00:02:49,745 --> 00:02:51,879
Oh, and he strips him
on the playing side!

79
00:02:51,914 --> 00:02:54,115
Ball's on the court,
but who wants it?

80
00:02:54,149 --> 00:02:58,786
- Get there, get there,
get there.

81
00:02:58,821 --> 00:03:01,155
- Oh, dallas tinker pounces
on the ball.

82
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,858
East dillon has come up with it.
First down east dillon.

83
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:06,260

- Listen up here.
Listen up.

86
00:03:11,967 --> 00:03:13,735
Hey, I call the play.
You understand?

87
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:15,570
- Yes, sir.
- I call the play.

88
00:03:15,604 --> 00:03:18,072
You run the play.
You got that?

89
00:03:18,107 --> 00:03:19,340
- You got it.

90
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:21,843
- Wildcat gun "x" throwback.
You understand me?

91
00:03:21,877 --> 00:03:22,910
- Wait, you want me
to throw it?

92
00:03:22,945 --> 00:03:24,278
- No, I want you to stand here.

93
00:03:24,313 --> 00:03:25,313
I want to talk about it
all night.

94
00:03:25,347 --> 00:03:26,547
Yes, I want you to throw it.

95
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:28,149
I want you to hit him
in-stride, you got me?

96
00:03:28,183 --> 00:03:30,518
- Yeah.
- Hit him in-stride.

97
00:03:30,552 --> 00:03:31,753
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

98
00:03:31,787 --> 00:03:33,554
- Let's go!
- Here we go!

99
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:36,958
- Watch this.
- Make it count.

101
00:03:40,496 --> 00:03:41,796
- Here we go, folks.

102
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,598
Vince howard on the wildcat
sweep going right.

103
00:03:43,632 --> 00:03:45,566
Oh, he pulls out
looking backside.

104
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:47,301
Going deep to cafferty.
A littlerickeration.

105
00:03:47,336 --> 00:03:51,439
He's wide open.
Oh, my. Pay dirt!

106
00:03:51,473 --> 00:03:53,941
Touchdown east dillon.
Touch down lions.

107

[cheers and applause]

108
00:03:55,144 --> 00:03:56,377

âª âª

110
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:03,284
- Real strong finish to a game
that could not be won, folks.

111
00:04:03,318 --> 00:04:05,987
But a monster game
out of vince howard.

112
00:04:06,021 --> 00:04:08,589
A little light for a team
that's been stuck in the dark

113
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:10,091
All season.

114
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,427
[excited chatter]

115
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:14,395
- All right, hey!

00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,899
- Listen up!
- Hey!

117
00:04:17,933 --> 00:04:20,301
Y'all got nothing
to be ashamed of.

118
00:04:20,335 --> 00:04:22,503
Y'all got nothing
to be ashamed of.

119
00:04:22,538 --> 00:04:23,738
Let's hear it.

120
00:04:23,772 --> 00:04:26,808
[cheering]

121
00:04:26,842 --> 00:04:28,142
Hey, listen up now.

122
00:04:28,177 --> 00:04:29,644
Listen up.
Y'all do me a favor.

123
00:04:29,678 --> 00:04:32,814
Y'all take a knee real quick.
- Yes, sir.

124
00:04:32,848 --> 00:04:34,782
- Most of you know
matt saracen.

125
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:37,452
Some of you know him
better than others.

126
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:39,954
A few of you have played
with him before.

127
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,957
You might have heard that
his father passed away.

128
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,927
The funeral's gonna be
in a couple days.

129
00:04:45,961 --> 00:04:47,929
Thought it'd be nice
if maybe we say a word for him

130
00:04:47,963 --> 00:04:49,764
And his family.

131
00:04:49,798 --> 00:04:51,099
Lands.

132
00:04:51,133 --> 00:04:53,968
- Bow your heads.

133
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,537
Our father,
who art in heaven.

134
00:04:56,572 --> 00:04:58,773
All: Hallowed be thy name.

135
00:04:58,807 --> 00:05:00,942
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done,

136
00:05:00,976 --> 00:05:03,678
On earth as it is in heaven.

137
00:05:03,712 --> 00:05:05,713
- Hello. This is first sergeant
henry saracen

138
00:05:05,747 --> 00:05:07,448
In mosul, iraq.

139
00:05:07,483 --> 00:05:08,449
It's your son.

140
00:05:08,484 --> 00:05:12,453
It's dad, it's me.

141
00:05:12,488 --> 00:05:15,490
I wish you, mom,
and you, matt,

142
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:18,192
Want to wish the two of you
a merry christmas.

143
00:05:18,227 --> 00:05:19,193
[knock at door]

144
00:05:19,228 --> 00:05:21,162
- You got company.

145
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,231
- Okay.

146
00:05:26,502 --> 00:05:29,570
- Bad movie night, matt.
It's not an option.

147
00:05:29,605 --> 00:05:30,571
- Hey.

148
00:05:30,606 --> 00:05:32,206
- Hey.

149
00:05:32,241 --> 00:05:34,008
- Okay, grandma's sleeping,

150
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,276
So keep it down.

151
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,511
I'll make some popcorn
for you.

152
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:40,114
- Thanks.

153
00:05:40,149 --> 00:05:41,816
How was the game?

154
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,885
- Uh, it was good.

155
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,387
Twinkle toes over here
kicked two points.

156
00:05:46,421 --> 00:05:48,156
- Twinkle toes?
- Twinkle toes.

157
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,323
- That is not my nickname.

158
00:05:49,358 --> 00:05:50,558
- I think it should be.

159
00:05:50,592 --> 00:05:52,093
- It's golden foot.

160
00:05:52,127 --> 00:05:54,829
I think I like
this one, matt.

161
00:05:56,632 --> 00:05:58,766
A lot of hands.

162
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,569
- Yeah, I guess.

163
00:06:01,603 --> 00:06:04,071
- What's this?

164
00:06:04,106 --> 00:06:06,073
- Uh, it's just
this video

165
00:06:06,108 --> 00:06:08,576
That my dad sent me
a couple christmases ago.

166
00:06:11,113 --> 00:06:13,481
- Matt, I sent you
something in the mail.

167
00:06:13,515 --> 00:06:15,883
Hopefully,
by now you got it.

168
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:17,852
This hat looks dumb.

169
00:06:17,886 --> 00:06:21,489
- 50 bucks.

170
00:06:21,523 --> 00:06:23,357
- We're doing
a good job here.

171
00:06:23,392 --> 00:06:25,693
Gonna be out of here soon.

172
00:06:25,727 --> 00:06:28,029
So I just wanted
to wish you a merry christmas.

173
00:06:30,499 --> 00:06:32,200
That's good.

174
00:06:32,234 --> 00:06:34,669
- That's nice.

175
00:06:34,703 --> 00:06:38,873
- Yeah.

176
00:06:38,907 --> 00:06:40,541
What do y'all
think of this one?

177
00:06:40,576 --> 00:06:43,010
- Is that a hand?

178
00:06:43,045 --> 00:06:44,478
I liked it.

179
00:06:44,513 --> 00:06:46,814
- It's good.
- Let's go watch the movie.

- hello.

183
00:07:52,481 --> 00:07:55,650
- Hey, did you read
the paper today?

184
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:57,351
- Paper?

185
00:07:57,386 --> 00:07:58,786
I don't get a paper, coach.

186
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,755
- Well, you got your face
in the paper

187
00:08:00,789 --> 00:08:02,623
As one of the co-conference
players of the week.

188
00:08:02,658 --> 00:08:05,526
- My picture?
How do I look?

189
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,029
- You look like an idiot.
That's how you look.

190
00:08:08,063 --> 00:08:10,064
- Okay.
- Picture looks great.

191
00:08:10,098 --> 00:08:12,033
- Yeah, but we still lost.
- I understand that.

192
00:08:12,067 --> 00:08:14,001
It means you played
a hell of a game though.

193
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:15,403
Listen,
what they want you to do

194
00:08:15,437 --> 00:08:17,471
Is they want you to come over
for the pancake breakfast.

195
00:08:17,506 --> 00:08:18,806
It's at 1:00.

196
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,675
They have you speak to,
you know, the little guys,

197
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,209
The pop warner kids
and stuff.

198
00:08:22,244 --> 00:08:23,511
You do that?

199
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:25,346
- Yeah, but why is it called
called a breakfast?

200
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,014
It's at 1:00.
Wouldn't it be, like, a lunch?

201
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:28,482
- Son, I don't know
why they do that.

202
00:08:28,517 --> 00:08:29,984
That's just what they call it.
Can you do it though?

203
00:08:30,018 --> 00:08:31,519
Can you be there then, right?

204
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:33,154
- I like pancakes.
- All right, good-bye.

205
00:08:33,188 --> 00:08:34,989
- Daddy, we need you
off the phone now.

206
00:08:53,308 --> 00:08:55,943
- Hey, mom,
we ain't got no electrics.

207
00:08:55,977 --> 00:08:57,712
No nothing.

208
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:59,480
Mom!

209
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,898

Mom, come on.

Come on.

00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:57,104
- I think the best thing
she could do right now

215
00:09:57,139 --> 00:09:58,506
Is just quit.

216
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,808
I'm serious.
That's just wrong.

217
00:10:00,842 --> 00:10:03,210
- Hush.
- Why the xylophone?

218
00:10:03,245 --> 00:10:06,380
This whole thing is confusing.

219
00:10:06,415 --> 00:10:09,016
- Shiftless son of a bitch.

220
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:11,218
- What?

221
00:10:11,253 --> 00:10:13,754
- My ex, her dad.

222
00:10:13,789 --> 00:10:15,689
Gonna miss her singing again.

223
00:10:15,724 --> 00:10:19,326
Always gone somewhere.
He never shows up.

Next up in the miss young

00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,402
We have miss becky sproles...

00:10:28,437 --> 00:10:30,104
- Whoo!
- Of east dillon.

229
00:10:30,138 --> 00:10:31,872

235
00:10:50,258 --> 00:10:51,792
- So you just have
to know, matt,

236
00:10:51,827 --> 00:10:53,327
That what your dad did--

237
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:55,062
What your daddy did
was important.

238
00:10:55,096 --> 00:10:58,132
I mean, right now I know
it seems real far away,

239
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:00,768
But we're over there
for a reason.

240
00:11:00,802 --> 00:11:02,837
And your daddy knew that.
- [sobbing]

241
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:04,472
- He was a hero.

242
00:11:04,506 --> 00:11:06,273
And that will
give you strength.

243
00:11:06,308 --> 00:11:08,275
- Thank you, mr. Garrity.
- Remember that.

244
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,577
- I will.
- Excuse me.

245
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:17,985
- Matty, you haven't moved
from that chair in an hour.

246
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:21,021
- I don't really need to.

247
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:22,823
Everybody just keeps
coming up to me.

248
00:11:22,858 --> 00:11:25,493
All I gotta do
is say thank you.

249
00:11:25,527 --> 00:11:26,961
And grandma's over there.

250
00:11:30,765 --> 00:11:32,800
He stepped on an I.E.D.

251
00:11:35,203 --> 00:11:39,173
How long do these things
go for?

252
00:11:39,207 --> 00:11:40,508
- You know what?
Screw you, bull.

253
00:11:40,542 --> 00:11:43,811
The pageant goes
for another two days.

254
00:11:43,845 --> 00:11:46,080
You know what,
you can still get here.

255
00:11:46,114 --> 00:11:48,082
I don't care!

256
00:11:48,116 --> 00:11:50,284
I really don't care
if you're hauling pieces

257
00:11:50,318 --> 00:11:52,553
Of jesus' cross
back to bethlehem.

258
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:54,388
You promised her
you were gonna be here,

259
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,756
And you are gonna be here.

260
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,057
This is so damn
typical of you, you--

261
00:11:57,092 --> 00:11:58,526
- Please.

262
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,160
- Do you have any idea what
you're doing to this girl?

263
00:12:00,195 --> 00:12:01,829
Any idea?

264
00:12:01,863 --> 00:12:03,330
She was so disappointed today.

265
00:12:03,365 --> 00:12:05,399
She sang her heart out for you,
and you didn't hear anything.

Excuse me.

It's the telephone
for you, tim.

272
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,610
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

273
00:12:16,645 --> 00:12:17,912
- Why are you
getting a phone call?

274
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:20,047
- I don't know.

275
00:12:20,081 --> 00:12:21,315
Hello.

276
00:12:21,349 --> 00:12:23,551
- Hey, tim.

277
00:12:23,585 --> 00:12:24,952
- Becky?

278
00:12:24,986 --> 00:12:27,187
- Well, I know.
I just--I tried your cell,

279
00:12:27,222 --> 00:12:28,989
And I tried you at work,
so I figured you must

280
00:12:29,024 --> 00:12:30,257
Be at matt saracen's.

281
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:32,092
- What are you doing right now?
I'm at a wake.

282
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,327
Do you know
what a wake is?

283
00:12:33,361 --> 00:12:34,962
- Yeah, I just--

284
00:12:34,996 --> 00:12:36,830
I figured that you weren't
close to the dead guy,

285
00:12:36,865 --> 00:12:38,933
But if you are, I'm sorry.
I'll hang up now.

286
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:40,801
- What's the problem?

287
00:12:40,835 --> 00:12:42,836
What is it, the trailer's
on fire or what?

288
00:12:42,871 --> 00:12:46,206
- No, I just--

289
00:12:46,241 --> 00:12:49,677
I just wanted
to tell you that, um,

290
00:12:49,711 --> 00:12:52,246
Thanks for coming today.

291
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,181
It meant a lot to me.

292
00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:00,588
- [sigh]
you're welcome.

293
00:13:00,622 --> 00:13:03,057
You did good,
and good luck.

294
00:13:03,091 --> 00:13:07,161
You'll probably win,
so don't blow it.

295
00:13:07,195 --> 00:13:08,896
- You really think so?

296
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:11,865
- All right, I gotta go.

297
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,568
- Oh, yeah.
Thanks, bye.

298
00:13:14,603 --> 00:13:15,970
- I'll see you around.

299
00:13:30,619 --> 00:13:32,920
- Wait, so your job

300
00:13:32,954 --> 00:13:34,989
Is, like, to see the bodies
home or something?

301
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:37,091
- I'm a recruiter,
mostly here in west texas.

302
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,093
But this is an honor job.

303
00:13:39,127 --> 00:13:41,061
- So you didn't
even know my dad?

304
00:13:41,096 --> 00:13:42,663
- No.

305
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:44,565
But I do my best to find out
about every man.

306
00:13:44,599 --> 00:13:48,936
Heard he was quite the joker
in his unit.

307
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,638
A funny guy.

308
00:13:50,672 --> 00:13:52,072
- My dad?

309
00:13:52,107 --> 00:13:53,607
- Yeah.

310
00:13:53,642 --> 00:13:55,609
He always kept up morale.

311
00:13:55,644 --> 00:13:57,978
Did practical jokes and such.

312
00:13:58,013 --> 00:13:59,313
It's important, matt.

313
00:13:59,347 --> 00:14:00,681
- Yeah, no, I'm sure it is,

314
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:02,516
But I'm also sure
that wasn't my dad.

315
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,985
I bet he was
a really good soldier

316
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,620
And all that,
but he wasn't a funny guy.

317
00:14:06,655 --> 00:14:08,255
He was not funny ever.

318
00:14:08,289 --> 00:14:09,757
So maybe you talked
to the wrong people.

319
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,025
Maybe it was another guy
who was the joker,

320
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:12,292
But my dad was not,
all right?

321
00:14:12,327 --> 00:14:13,794
I've never even seen him
smile in his life.

322
00:14:13,828 --> 00:14:15,162
So I can't--
- excuse me, matt.

323
00:14:15,196 --> 00:14:16,397
I think someone's--
someone's asking for you.

324
00:14:16,431 --> 00:14:17,798
- Yeah, it was good
talking to you.

325
00:14:17,832 --> 00:14:20,100
- Yeah, you too.
Thank you for coming.

326
00:14:20,135 --> 00:14:21,602
- Are you okay?
- I don't know.

327
00:14:21,636 --> 00:14:23,404
And I don't even understand
why they send this guy.

328
00:14:23,438 --> 00:14:25,239
He's never even seen my dad
before in his life.

329
00:14:25,273 --> 00:14:27,074
We all know that he was not
a very funny--

330
00:14:27,108 --> 00:14:28,409
- I know, I know.

331
00:14:28,443 --> 00:14:31,345
That's why the riggins clan
and myself,

332
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:34,314
We're gonna take you
out of here tomorrow night,

333
00:14:34,349 --> 00:14:37,518
Away from all the death
and the dying

334
00:14:37,552 --> 00:14:39,019
And the deviled eggs.

335
00:14:39,054 --> 00:14:40,621
- Yeah, fine.
Whatever, fine.

336
00:14:40,655 --> 00:14:42,589
I just don't want...
[knock on door]

337
00:14:42,624 --> 00:14:44,324
Someone talking about
my dad anymore.

338
00:14:44,359 --> 00:14:45,826
- Okay.
- Hello.

339
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:49,229
- Hey, matt.
- Our condolences.

340
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:51,298
On behalf of the boosters--
- are you serious?

341
00:14:51,332 --> 00:14:53,067
- Excuse me?

342
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:54,401
On behalf of the boosters

343
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:55,669
And the entire
panther organization,

344
00:14:55,704 --> 00:14:57,204
We just--

345
00:15:00,675 --> 00:15:03,410
- Ah.

346
00:15:10,085 --> 00:15:11,652
[horn honks]

347
00:15:14,155 --> 00:15:15,789
- 'sup cafferty?

348
00:15:15,824 --> 00:15:18,459
- I'm running, man.

349
00:15:18,493 --> 00:15:20,694
- I think he's--
you know, I think he's mad

350
00:15:20,729 --> 00:15:22,830
That I'm co-conference
player of the week.

351
00:15:22,864 --> 00:15:24,231
- Yeah, that's what
I'm pissed about.

352
00:15:24,265 --> 00:15:26,133
- See this right here?
Look, hey, luke.

353
00:15:26,167 --> 00:15:27,634
That's me.
That's j.D. Mccoy right there.

354
00:15:27,669 --> 00:15:29,970
But I'm sharing this
with this guy.

355
00:15:30,004 --> 00:15:31,472
I don't know who this guy is.
What's his name, vince howard?

356
00:15:31,506 --> 00:15:32,840
Do you know a guy
by that name?

357
00:15:32,874 --> 00:15:34,341
- Yeah, come to think of it,
I do recall spending

358
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:36,376
A couple hours in jail
with someone by that name.

359
00:15:36,411 --> 00:15:37,678
I don't know how I got there,

360
00:15:37,712 --> 00:15:40,247
Considering my friends
were with me at the time,

361
00:15:40,281 --> 00:15:42,349
Kevin and--what did you say
your name was, j.D. Mcdick?

362
00:15:42,383 --> 00:15:44,151
- Oh, come on, man.
Look, the cops were there, okay?

363
00:15:44,185 --> 00:15:45,385
We took off.
I'm sorry.

364
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,520
- You're a jackass, dude.

365
00:15:46,554 --> 00:15:47,855
- Look, what do you
want me to do?

366
00:15:47,889 --> 00:15:49,089
You want me to get out
and get on my hands and knees,

367
00:15:49,124 --> 00:15:50,691
Is that what you want me to do?
I'll do it.

368
00:15:50,725 --> 00:15:52,359
- Look, man.
Buddy, we're both sorry.

369
00:15:52,393 --> 00:15:54,394
All right, but we're going
paintballing tomorrow night.

370
00:15:54,429 --> 00:15:55,829
We want you to come.

371
00:15:55,864 --> 00:15:57,197
It'll be fun, man.
Come on, please.

372
00:15:57,232 --> 00:15:58,732
- I'll think about it.
- Think about it.

373
00:15:58,767 --> 00:16:00,267
- All right, but hey, luke,
right here, man.

374
00:16:00,301 --> 00:16:01,435
Give it to me.

375
00:16:01,469 --> 00:16:03,003
- Luke, we'll see you
around, man.

376
00:16:03,037 --> 00:16:05,172
We're sorry.
Later, bud.

377
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:09,743
- Julie will sit here
with you.

378
00:16:09,778 --> 00:16:13,280
- Good idea.
- Thank you, julie.

379
00:16:13,314 --> 00:16:14,782
- You don't think
she'll get hot in there?

380
00:16:14,816 --> 00:16:15,949
- No, she'll be fine.

381
00:16:15,984 --> 00:16:17,151
Julie's with her.
She'll be okay.

382
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:18,418
Don't you worry, okay,
hon?

383
00:16:18,453 --> 00:16:19,720
- Uh-huh.

384
00:16:19,754 --> 00:16:21,889
- What you've got here
is what we like to call

385
00:16:21,923 --> 00:16:24,291
Our american hero
memorial package.

386
00:16:24,325 --> 00:16:26,160
Now, this comes
with your choice

387
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:28,729
Of a mahogany
or cherry wood casket.

388
00:16:28,763 --> 00:16:30,531
The standard outer
burial container.

389
00:16:30,565 --> 00:16:32,900
- What--
what's that?

390
00:16:32,934 --> 00:16:35,869
- Well, over time,
the caskets themselves

391
00:16:35,904 --> 00:16:38,338
Deteriorate in the soil,
the moisture.

392
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:39,606
- Oh.

393
00:16:39,641 --> 00:16:41,608
- And since veteran affairs
will be picking up

394
00:16:41,643 --> 00:16:43,744
Most of the bill,
you can honor your father

395
00:16:43,778 --> 00:16:46,079
In a manner he deserves.

396
00:16:46,114 --> 00:16:47,381
- Right, thanks.

397
00:16:47,415 --> 00:16:49,249
- So there's the embalming.

398
00:16:49,284 --> 00:16:53,453
- Is--is my dad here?

399
00:16:53,488 --> 00:16:55,923
- Oh, he's being prepared
right now.

400
00:16:55,957 --> 00:16:57,991
- Do I see him?

401
00:16:58,026 --> 00:17:00,961
- I think, in this case,

402
00:17:00,995 --> 00:17:03,297
A closed casket
is most appropriate.

403
00:17:03,331 --> 00:17:05,632
- Right, right.

404
00:17:05,667 --> 00:17:06,967
- Okay. So--

405
00:17:07,001 --> 00:17:08,168
- Actually, if that's
the case,

406
00:17:08,203 --> 00:17:09,403
Can I just ask
one quick question?

407
00:17:09,437 --> 00:17:10,704
Sorry to interrupt.

408
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,906
This viewing/visitation day,

409
00:17:12,941 --> 00:17:15,008
Use of facilities,
use of staff, day prior.

410
00:17:15,043 --> 00:17:17,477
That wouldn't be necessary
if it's a closed casket,

411
00:17:17,512 --> 00:17:18,779
Is that right?
- Of course.

412
00:17:18,813 --> 00:17:20,781
- Okay, so we can
get rid of those charges.

413
00:17:20,815 --> 00:17:22,583
That would be great.
Thank you.

414
00:17:22,617 --> 00:17:25,619
- Now see,
the rest is laid out.

415
00:17:25,653 --> 00:17:27,788
This is for
the funeral service escort.

416
00:17:27,822 --> 00:17:29,223
- I don't understand
that either.

417
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:31,825
The funeral service escort,
what does that mean exactly?

418
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,160
- Well, those are the cars
that will--

419
00:17:33,194 --> 00:17:34,461
You know, for the family,
friends.

420
00:17:34,495 --> 00:17:36,530
- Well, they have cars.
I mean, we all have cars.

421
00:17:36,564 --> 00:17:38,832
- Yeah, and, um--

422
00:17:38,867 --> 00:17:40,634
And my grandma's
in the car right now.

423
00:17:40,668 --> 00:17:43,170
So can we just decide
whatever this is and--

424
00:17:43,204 --> 00:17:44,738
- You know, why don't you--
you go on out there.

425
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,073
I can finish up with him.

426
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,574
I think we're just about
at the end of it anyway.

427
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:48,976
You go on out.
- You sure?

428
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:50,510
- Yeah, I think so.
I think so.

429
00:17:50,545 --> 00:17:52,145
All right,
I think this is just--

430
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,447
- Thank you.

431
00:17:53,481 --> 00:17:54,648
- You have any questions,
call me.

432
00:17:54,682 --> 00:17:56,016
- Yes, sir.

433
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:57,818
Thank you.
- I'll be right there.

434
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,521
I need to ask you
a quick question.

435
00:18:01,556 --> 00:18:03,490
With all due respect,
does that boy look like

436
00:18:03,524 --> 00:18:05,592
He can pay $9,000
to bury his father?

437
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:07,794
- Well, veterans affairs
will be picking up--

438
00:18:07,829 --> 00:18:09,563
- You look me in the eye,
you tell me veterans affairs

439
00:18:09,597 --> 00:18:12,266
Is gonna pick up
a $9,000 bill.

440
00:18:14,035 --> 00:18:16,103
- No, not the entire $9,000.

441
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:17,204
- Mm-hmm.

442
00:18:17,238 --> 00:18:18,672
- But they do pick up
a large portion.

443
00:18:18,706 --> 00:18:20,340
- Okay, well, I think--
we need to start over

444
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:21,508
From the beginning, okay?

445
00:18:21,542 --> 00:18:22,910
And let's do this quickly,
please.

446
00:18:22,944 --> 00:18:24,478
Do you have another listing
you can give me?

447
00:18:24,512 --> 00:18:26,313
- Keep your hands
to yourself, man.

448
00:18:26,347 --> 00:18:28,215
We're looking
for old cars like this.

449
00:18:28,249 --> 00:18:30,017
- What is this, man?

450
00:18:30,051 --> 00:18:31,451
- Old models, man,
all right?

451
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:32,719
You see when they stop
making the cars,

452
00:18:32,754 --> 00:18:33,921
They stop making the parts.

453
00:18:33,955 --> 00:18:35,722
It makes the parts worth more,
you feel me?

454
00:18:35,757 --> 00:18:37,324
- Like a bunch of junk parts in
here, man.

455
00:18:37,358 --> 00:18:38,825
- You see a new car,

456
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,761
Think it's sharp,
think it's fly,

457
00:18:40,795 --> 00:18:41,828
You need to walk away.

458
00:18:41,863 --> 00:18:43,664
- Walk away? Why?

459
00:18:43,698 --> 00:18:46,266
- Oh, it's 'cause they got
that lojack, man.

460
00:18:46,301 --> 00:18:47,634
- Man, we're in west texas.

461
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:49,136
Ain't nobody
got no lojack.

462
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,138
You walk away
'cause half them new cars

463
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:52,306
Got them steering locks.

464
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,974
Lojack.
Man, what's wrong with you?

465
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:55,809
- I told him his braids
too tight sometimes.

466
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,511
He don't listen.
- Hey, man, watch out.

467
00:18:57,545 --> 00:18:59,212
- Watch out, what?
Watch out.

468
00:18:59,247 --> 00:19:01,014
- Yo, yo, both of you
need to shut up.

469
00:19:01,049 --> 00:19:02,416
This here is school,

470
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:04,184
And the more you talk,
the more you miss.

471
00:19:04,218 --> 00:19:05,686
The more you miss, the more
likely your bitch asses

472
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,287
Are gonna
do something stupid.

473
00:19:07,322 --> 00:19:11,224
All right, this place where
you put the keys in,

474
00:19:11,259 --> 00:19:12,726
It's called a tumbler.

475
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,894
You stick your
screwdriver in it,

476
00:19:13,928 --> 00:19:15,162
Jiggle it a little bit.

477
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:16,897
Sometimes the dashboard
might come on.

478
00:19:16,931 --> 00:19:18,799
Sometimes the engine.
Yo, don't panic.

479
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:22,803
Be cool and get paid.

480
00:19:22,837 --> 00:19:24,972
[engine starts]

481
00:19:25,006 --> 00:19:26,340
Most of the times,
this ain't an option.

482
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:28,275
Then you gotta
hot box the bitch.

483
00:19:28,309 --> 00:19:31,011
Come in closer.
This is the magic.

484
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:32,512
- Honey, we're gonna leave
in just a minute.

485
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:34,548
- Yeah, all right.

486
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:40,821
Hey.

487
00:19:40,855 --> 00:19:44,124
- Hi.

488
00:19:44,158 --> 00:19:46,360
That was really nice
of your mom.

489
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:48,762
I appreciate it.

490
00:19:48,796 --> 00:19:50,697
- She's good in crisis.

491
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:53,767
She's pretty much
built for crisis.

492
00:19:53,801 --> 00:19:55,802
- Yeah.

493
00:19:59,007 --> 00:20:02,109
- She's invited you over
for dinner tonight

494
00:20:02,143 --> 00:20:03,343
If you want to come.

495
00:20:03,378 --> 00:20:05,345
I said you probably
had family stuff to do,

496
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:08,582
But if you want to get away
for an hour or something,

497
00:20:08,616 --> 00:20:10,917
I'd love to see you.

498
00:20:10,952 --> 00:20:13,053
- Wkay.

499
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:16,089
- Okay, you'll come or...?

500
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:20,660
- Um...

501
00:20:20,695 --> 00:20:21,962
Yeah, okay, I'll--

502
00:20:21,996 --> 00:20:23,997
Okay, I'll come.

503
00:20:26,734 --> 00:20:28,969
- Are you all right?

504
00:20:29,003 --> 00:20:32,906
- Yeah, I'm fine.
I just--

505
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,875
You know,
this stuff happens.

506
00:20:34,909 --> 00:20:37,277
Right now
it's happening to me.

507
00:20:37,311 --> 00:20:39,079
Someday it's gonna
happen to you.

508
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:41,114
And--

509
00:20:43,384 --> 00:20:46,319
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it like that.

510
00:20:46,354 --> 00:20:48,855
That was a stupid thing
to say.

511
00:20:53,194 --> 00:20:56,029
- It's okay.

512
00:20:56,064 --> 00:20:59,299
- So what time
is this dinner?

513
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:05,872
- Koala bears--
you know what they eat?

514
00:21:05,907 --> 00:21:07,674
Do you know
what koala bears eat?

515
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:10,744
- And that's more than enough
for a first down.

516
00:21:10,778 --> 00:21:12,913
That makes it six carries
for 38 yards.

517
00:21:12,947 --> 00:21:15,348
I'm not saying
this young man's ready to start,

518
00:21:15,383 --> 00:21:16,850
But brian "smash" williams

519
00:21:16,884 --> 00:21:18,185
Is making the most
of this blowout.

520
00:21:18,219 --> 00:21:20,053
- Look at him run, huh?
Look at him go.

521
00:21:20,088 --> 00:21:21,354
- Hey.
- How 'bout that?

522
00:21:21,389 --> 00:21:24,224
- Look at y'all.
- Mmm.

523
00:21:24,258 --> 00:21:26,426
- Hi, sweet girl.

524
00:21:26,461 --> 00:21:27,594
Hey.
- Hey, how you doing?

525
00:21:27,628 --> 00:21:28,762
- Did y'all have fun?

526
00:21:28,796 --> 00:21:30,430
- It's almost time
for a nap for you.

527
00:21:30,465 --> 00:21:31,798
- Mm-hmm.
- How'd it go?

528
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,835
- It went.
Somebody ready for a nap?

529
00:21:34,869 --> 00:21:36,236
- "no, no."

530
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:39,272
- Maybe we'll both
lie down together for a nap.

531
00:21:39,307 --> 00:21:40,907
- [whispering] here, here, here,
here, here.

532
00:21:40,942 --> 00:21:44,478
Take that with you.

533
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:46,513
- All right.

534
00:21:55,223 --> 00:21:56,656
- How's he holding up?

535
00:21:56,691 --> 00:21:58,692
- Um...

536
00:22:02,663 --> 00:22:04,798
He's trying.

537
00:22:06,801 --> 00:22:08,802
- Oh.

538
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:32,792
I'm not going anywhere.

539
00:22:43,638 --> 00:22:44,604
- Who's your favorite
football player?

540
00:22:44,639 --> 00:22:45,605
- You ever heard
of johnny unitas?

541
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,606
- Mm-hmm.

542
00:22:46,641 --> 00:22:48,041
- My old coach over there

543
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:49,276
Used to tell me
about johnny unitas.

544
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:51,278
Said I remind him a lot
of johnny unitas.

545
00:22:51,312 --> 00:22:52,412
See that old man
over there in the back,

546
00:22:52,446 --> 00:22:54,147
One of the oldest guys
in this room?

547
00:22:54,182 --> 00:22:55,382
[laughter]

548
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:56,850
That's my dad.

549
00:22:56,884 --> 00:22:58,718
He taught me
everything I know.

550
00:22:58,753 --> 00:22:59,953
You gotta be fast.

551
00:22:59,987 --> 00:23:01,288
You gotta know
what plays you're calling.

552
00:23:01,322 --> 00:23:02,656
You gotta look around.
You gotta see everything moving.

553
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:03,957
When I step to the line,

554
00:23:03,991 --> 00:23:05,759
I see everything happening
way before it happens.

555
00:23:05,793 --> 00:23:08,195
I'm a good one or two seconds
ahead of the coverage.

556
00:23:08,229 --> 00:23:10,263
- The boy scout's
pretty arrogant.

557
00:23:10,298 --> 00:23:12,532
- You guys are all the team,
okay?

558
00:23:12,567 --> 00:23:13,867
- He's got a hell of an arm.

559
00:23:13,901 --> 00:23:16,269
- All right, be a hero,
win championships.

560
00:23:16,304 --> 00:23:18,805
I see it in you.
All right?

561
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:21,408
[applause]

562
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:23,076
- Thank you, j.D.

563
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,945
<i>Now for our other

00:23:24,979 --> 00:23:26,880

567
00:23:33,521 --> 00:23:35,822
Now some of you kids here,
this is your first year

568
00:23:35,856 --> 00:23:37,224
Playing pop warner,
but guess what.

569
00:23:37,258 --> 00:23:39,960
This is vince's
first year too.

570
00:23:39,994 --> 00:23:41,795
So pay attention,
all right?

571
00:23:41,829 --> 00:23:43,096
You've got a role model here.

572
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,464
What do you say, vince?

573
00:23:44,498 --> 00:23:46,299
You got some words
for these players here?

574
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,574
- What am I supposed to say?

575
00:23:54,609 --> 00:23:56,476
- Just talk about the game.

576
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:58,178
Just tell 'em about it.

577
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:08,388
- Don't panic,
all right?

578
00:24:08,422 --> 00:24:11,691
Stay cool,
and you'll get paid.

579
00:24:11,726 --> 00:24:13,493
- Yeah!

580
00:24:13,527 --> 00:24:15,829
[applause]

581
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:29,976
- Stop.
- Hold on, one--

582
00:24:30,011 --> 00:24:31,945
- Seriously, get away from me.
- Two, say it.

583
00:24:31,979 --> 00:24:33,380
- No regrets.
- No regret.

584
00:24:35,449 --> 00:24:36,449

586
00:24:39,153 --> 00:24:40,320
- Ahh!

587
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:41,855
That feels good.

588
00:24:41,889 --> 00:24:43,323
- That was really close.

589
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:44,724
- Hey, you guys remember
the state finals game

590
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:46,593
Three years ago?
- Uh-uh.

591
00:24:46,627 --> 00:24:47,894
- No, billy.
- What game?

592
00:24:47,928 --> 00:24:50,163
- Who played in it?
- Stop messing with me, man.

593
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:53,033
- Are you really reminiscing
about three years ago?

594
00:24:53,067 --> 00:24:54,067
- You guys remember,
there was, like,

595
00:24:54,101 --> 00:24:55,068
Ten seconds
left on the clock.

596
00:24:55,102 --> 00:24:56,703
We had matt "mayday" saracen

597
00:24:56,737 --> 00:24:59,673
Sitting back there
behind the center.

598
00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:01,508
- Never has he been called
"mayday."

599
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:03,543
- Well, we need to come up
with a nickname.

600
00:25:03,577 --> 00:25:05,378
I like "cobra."
it's got a good sound to it.

601
00:25:05,413 --> 00:25:06,813
Hey, cobra, think fast.

602
00:25:06,847 --> 00:25:08,348
You're cobra.

603
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:09,582
- Dude.

604
00:25:09,617 --> 00:25:12,018
- Why would you kill
cobra's beer?

605
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:13,219
- I know.
Hey, let's see your hands.

606
00:25:13,254 --> 00:25:14,521
- You guys know
I have to give a eulogy

607
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:16,489
At this thing tomorrow?

608
00:25:16,524 --> 00:25:20,760
I got to get up there
in front of everybody

609
00:25:20,795 --> 00:25:25,165
And say good stuff
about this man.

610
00:25:26,801 --> 00:25:29,269
And all I really
want to say is,

611
00:25:29,303 --> 00:25:31,871
"here lies henry saracen.

612
00:25:31,906 --> 00:25:34,507
"his mother annoyed him.

613
00:25:34,542 --> 00:25:36,776
"his wife couldn't stand him.

614
00:25:36,811 --> 00:25:38,611
"and he didn't want to be a dad,
so he took off

615
00:25:38,646 --> 00:25:41,715

'cause that was the only way

617
00:25:43,551 --> 00:25:45,185
"and ditch
all your responsibilities

00:25:45,219 --> 00:25:46,553
"and no one could
call you out on it.

00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:48,188
"and that worked out great,
so you just decided

"and now here you are.

"and all you got left,
all you left behind

"and a son

Thank you for coming,
100 people I do not know."

628
00:26:13,247 --> 00:26:14,547
And you know what
the worst part is?

629
00:26:14,582 --> 00:26:15,982
Even if I did get up there
and say that,

630
00:26:16,016 --> 00:26:18,451
Even if I finally did, like,
say all that to him,

631
00:26:18,486 --> 00:26:20,186
I don't even know
if I'd be saying it to him

632
00:26:20,221 --> 00:26:22,555
Because I don't even know
if he's in that damn box.

633
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:24,257
It's a closed casket.

634
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,259
For all I know,
it's someone else.

635
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:28,528
It's someone funnier.

636
00:26:28,562 --> 00:26:31,698
Or a bunch of rocks.
I don't ev--

637
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,137
- Well...

638
00:26:37,171 --> 00:26:40,240
- There's only one way
to find out then.

639
00:26:42,243 --> 00:26:45,812
Right?

640
00:26:45,846 --> 00:26:47,347
Cobra, you got the key.

641
00:26:47,381 --> 00:26:48,848
- There's no key.

642
00:26:48,883 --> 00:26:50,717
- Break the window.
- There's probably a door--

643
00:26:50,751 --> 00:26:51,951
- Just break it.
- It's stuck.

644
00:26:51,986 --> 00:26:53,286
- Yeah.
- Go.

645
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,687
- All right, go in.

646
00:26:54,722 --> 00:26:56,356
- You sure we're supposed
to be doing--

647
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:58,591
- You're wasted.
- Where is he?

648
00:26:58,626 --> 00:27:00,059
Where is he?

649
00:27:00,094 --> 00:27:02,562
- That's where
I saw him before.

650
00:27:02,596 --> 00:27:04,063
Hold on.

651
00:27:04,098 --> 00:27:06,366
All right, it's this guy,
it's this guy.

652
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,700
Hey.

653
00:27:07,735 --> 00:27:09,636
- Hey, matt.

654
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:12,505
- Hey, my friend--
- hey, hold on.

655
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:15,308
- My friend wants to see
his old man.

656
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,544
- I want to see my dad.

657
00:27:17,578 --> 00:27:19,879
- Um, well, I thought
we agreed earlier

658
00:27:19,914 --> 00:27:21,881
That that probably
wasn't a very good idea.

659
00:27:21,916 --> 00:27:23,817
- Look, buddy,
he wants to see his dad.

660
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:26,519
- Hey, hey.
Just hey, stop, stop, stop.

662
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,690
Look, I know what
we decided earlier,

663
00:27:30,724 --> 00:27:34,994
But now...
I want to see my dad. Now.

664
00:27:57,017 --> 00:28:00,353
That's him?
- Yeah.

665
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,856
Son, I really don't think
this is a very good idea.

666
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,291
- I appreciate that,

667
00:28:05,326 --> 00:28:07,827
But please just open it.
- Okay.

668
00:28:31,051 --> 00:28:33,820
- Thank you.

669
00:28:40,628 --> 00:28:42,695
- Matt, you all right?

670
00:28:55,509 --> 00:28:56,809
- Hey, kevin,
right here, man.

[paintball guns shooting]
pictures, baby.

672

- Dude, I thought we were going
to the field, man, come on.

673
00:29:00,681 --> 00:29:02,048
- We are going to the field.

674
00:29:02,082 --> 00:29:03,917
We're just getting
a little practice in first.

675
00:29:03,951 --> 00:29:05,385
- Kevin, cut that out, dude.

676
00:29:05,419 --> 00:29:07,353
You're getting paint
on my truck, man, come on.

677
00:29:07,388 --> 00:29:09,022
- This truck's
a piece of crap anyways.

678
00:29:09,056 --> 00:29:10,557
Don't worry about it.
- Yeah, it's a piece of crap

679
00:29:10,591 --> 00:29:11,758
I had to pay for
with my own money, dumbass.

680
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:13,226
- Hey, yo, yo.
- All right, bud.

681
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,394
- Get this pedestrian
right here.

682
00:29:14,428 --> 00:29:15,728
- Hey, don't shoot him.

683
00:29:15,763 --> 00:29:19,265
Don't shoot him.
- Whoo!

684
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,867
- Oh, my god.
What are you doing?

685

[tires squeal]

686
00:29:23,337 --> 00:29:25,705
- What are you
stopping the car for?

687
00:29:25,739 --> 00:29:27,373
- Get out of the truck.
Get out of the truck!

688
00:29:27,408 --> 00:29:29,042
- Hey, yo, relax.
Just chill out.

689
00:29:29,076 --> 00:29:30,743
You got some kind
of chip on your shoulder, man.

690
00:29:30,778 --> 00:29:32,312
- I'm fine.
- Look, that school you go to

691
00:29:32,346 --> 00:29:34,247
Is a dump, okay?
We all know this.

692
00:29:34,281 --> 00:29:35,715
Do you want us
to pretend it's not

693
00:29:35,749 --> 00:29:36,950
And lie about it to you?

694
00:29:36,984 --> 00:29:38,318
- Oh, okay, so every time
we get to hang out,

695
00:29:38,352 --> 00:29:40,053
That means I get to be the one
that you all look down on?

696
00:29:40,087 --> 00:29:42,255
- We don't look down on you.
- [scoffs]

697
00:29:42,289 --> 00:29:44,257
- We look down on you
with you.

698
00:29:44,291 --> 00:29:45,592
- [laughs] that's right.
That was a good one.

699
00:29:45,626 --> 00:29:47,560
- All right, jokers.
All right, that's funny.

700
00:29:47,595 --> 00:29:49,095
- What?
Come on, luke.

701
00:29:49,129 --> 00:29:50,730
- Get out.
- Why you gotta do this?

702
00:29:50,764 --> 00:29:51,898
- Get out of the truck.

703
00:29:51,932 --> 00:29:53,299
- What's your problem
tonight, man?

704
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:55,602
- What's my problem?
You're my problem, idiot.

705
00:29:55,636 --> 00:29:57,437
- What are you doing?
- Ah, god!

706
00:29:57,471 --> 00:29:58,805
- What are you doing, dude?

707
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:00,573
- I'm not going paintballing
is what I'm doing.

708
00:30:00,608 --> 00:30:02,442
- You know what,
screw you, luke.

709
00:30:02,476 --> 00:30:04,944
How's it feel being second best
on the worst team in texas?

710
00:30:04,979 --> 00:30:06,245
- All right,
better watch it.

711
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:10,149
Ah!

712
00:30:10,184 --> 00:30:11,918
- Come on, man.

713
00:30:11,952 --> 00:30:13,186
Luke, I'm sorry.

714
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,487
- Oh, yeah, I'm sorry too.

715
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:15,555
You're done, dude.
You're done.

716
00:30:15,589 --> 00:30:16,956
- Come on, luke.

717
00:30:16,991 --> 00:30:20,360
- Get off my truck!
Get off my truck.

718
00:30:21,428 --> 00:30:22,629
- Screw you, luke!

719
00:30:22,663 --> 00:30:24,931
[firing]

720
00:30:44,251 --> 00:30:46,185
- Hey.

721
00:30:49,757 --> 00:30:51,758
- Hey.

722
00:31:00,401 --> 00:31:03,136
How'd it go?

723
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:05,304
- Second runner-up.

724
00:31:08,676 --> 00:31:12,011
- That's, um--
that's third, right?

725
00:31:12,046 --> 00:31:13,179
- Yeah.

726
00:31:13,213 --> 00:31:16,015
- Then I guess
it's not really--

727
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:17,884
- Third place sucks.
- Yeah, it's crap.

728
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:25,158
Yep.

729
00:31:25,192 --> 00:31:27,627
- So how was your day?

730
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:32,165
- Weird.

731
00:31:32,199 --> 00:31:34,267
- Weird how?

732
00:31:37,171 --> 00:31:40,373
- I saw something that, uh--

733
00:31:43,444 --> 00:31:46,746
Or rather I saw someone
see something that...

734
00:31:51,719 --> 00:31:55,521
You ever just feel
completely useless?

735
00:31:55,556 --> 00:31:58,558
- You're not useless.

736
00:31:58,592 --> 00:32:01,260
- Right.

737
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:07,166
- Close your eyes.

738
00:32:07,201 --> 00:32:08,901
Just do it.

739
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,484
- [clears throat]

740
00:32:25,753 --> 00:32:28,287
No.

741
00:32:28,322 --> 00:32:30,990
This--

742
00:32:31,024 --> 00:32:32,425
This can't happen.

743
00:32:32,459 --> 00:32:35,261
I can't do this.

744
00:32:38,432 --> 00:32:39,766
Good night.

745
00:32:44,438 --> 00:32:52,345
âª âª

746
00:32:52,379 --> 00:32:53,446
- Hi.

747
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,747
- You got I.D.?

748
00:32:54,782 --> 00:32:56,516
- Oh, it's for my mama.

749
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:57,917
She ain't feeling too good.

750
00:32:57,951 --> 00:32:59,552
- I need to see I.D.

751
00:32:59,586 --> 00:33:01,120
- Okay, you know what,
I walked all--

752
00:33:01,155 --> 00:33:03,256
- Hey bud,
you're almost out of soap.

753
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:06,092
Hey.
Becky, right?

754
00:33:06,126 --> 00:33:07,260
- Yeah.

755
00:33:07,294 --> 00:33:09,061
- There you go.

756
00:33:09,096 --> 00:33:10,363
- That doesn't look good.

757
00:33:10,397 --> 00:33:11,931
- Mm-mm.

758
00:33:11,965 --> 00:33:13,866
What do you think?

759
00:33:13,901 --> 00:33:15,902
- I think you ought
to buy something.

760
00:33:15,936 --> 00:33:20,039
- We're together.
This is my stuff.

761
00:33:20,073 --> 00:33:23,342
âª âª

762
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:24,877
Here's my I.D.

763
00:33:26,613 --> 00:33:28,014
- Thanks.

764
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:30,383
- Sure.

765
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:35,521
- Well, thanks again.

766
00:33:35,556 --> 00:33:37,123
- Yeah, yeah.

767
00:33:37,157 --> 00:33:38,658
My name's luke.

768
00:33:38,692 --> 00:33:40,393
- I know who you are.

769
00:33:40,427 --> 00:33:41,861
- Oh.
Here you go.

770
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:43,763
- Yeah.
See you later.

771
00:33:43,797 --> 00:33:47,633
- All right, night.

772
00:33:47,668 --> 00:33:49,335
Hey, you want to go
to a car wash?

773
00:33:49,369 --> 00:33:51,904
I got to go
to a car wash.

774
00:33:51,939 --> 00:33:54,173
Look at that thing.

775
00:33:57,644 --> 00:34:00,112
- Sure.
Why the hell not?

776
00:34:00,147 --> 00:34:02,548
- All right.
Why the hell not?

777
00:34:05,118 --> 00:34:06,152
[knocking at door]

778
00:34:06,186 --> 00:34:08,487
- You want to get that,
sweetie?

779
00:34:15,362 --> 00:34:16,529
- Hey.

780
00:34:16,563 --> 00:34:17,496
- Hey.

781
00:34:17,531 --> 00:34:19,599
- Sorry, um,

782
00:34:19,633 --> 00:34:22,935
I know I'm really late.

783
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:25,771
- It's okay.

784
00:34:25,806 --> 00:34:28,207
We saved you a plate.

785
00:34:28,242 --> 00:34:29,976
- Thank you.
Thank you.

786
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:31,644
Mrs. Taylor, I'm sorry.
I know that--

787
00:34:31,678 --> 00:34:33,913
- Oh, you're fine, honey.
We saved you a plate.

788
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:35,615
We saved our dessert
for now.

789
00:34:35,649 --> 00:34:37,516
We'll have dessert with you.
You're fine.

790
00:34:37,551 --> 00:34:39,719
- Thank you.
- Come on, sit down.

791
00:34:39,753 --> 00:34:40,887
Don't you worry.
- You drive?

792
00:34:40,921 --> 00:34:42,722
- No, sir, no, no.

793
00:34:42,756 --> 00:34:44,490
I had a nice walk though.

794
00:34:51,565 --> 00:34:54,200
- Well?

795
00:34:56,169 --> 00:34:59,605
- You don't have to eat it
if you don't want to.

796
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,741
- I'm hungry.

797
00:35:01,775 --> 00:35:04,043
- Well, do you want
something else, hon?

798
00:35:04,077 --> 00:35:06,245
You don't--
- no, it's--

799
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,147
I'm sorry, mrs. Taylor,

800
00:35:08,181 --> 00:35:09,582
I don't like carrots.

801
00:35:09,616 --> 00:35:11,517
- Oh, well, then--

802
00:35:11,551 --> 00:35:14,687
- And I don't like when
they touch the meat so...

803
00:35:14,721 --> 00:35:16,188
- Well, I'll just
take it away then.

804
00:35:16,223 --> 00:35:17,957
- No, look, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

805
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:19,325
- No, no, no, no.
- No, it's fine.

806
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:21,060
I'm being rude.
I'm sorry, I don't--

807
00:35:21,094 --> 00:35:22,495
- Honey, you're fine.

808
00:35:22,529 --> 00:35:24,864
- I don't like being rude.
I don't like being rude.

809
00:35:24,898 --> 00:35:26,098
- It's okay.

810
00:35:26,133 --> 00:35:28,401
- I'm just having
a moment here.

811
00:35:28,435 --> 00:35:31,003
I just--

812
00:35:31,038 --> 00:35:34,173
I'm just having a moment.
I don't think I'm okay.

813
00:35:34,207 --> 00:35:35,808
- Matt.

814
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:37,810
- [sobbing]

815
00:35:41,448 --> 00:35:43,316
I hate him.

816
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:46,152
And I don't--

817
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:49,455
I don't like hating people.

818
00:35:49,489 --> 00:35:52,091
But I just put
all my hate on him

819
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:54,927
So I don't have to hate
anybody else

820
00:35:54,962 --> 00:35:59,131
And so that I could be
a good person, you know,

821
00:35:59,166 --> 00:36:02,668
To my grandmother
and to my friends.

822
00:36:04,738 --> 00:36:06,973
To your daughter.

823
00:36:07,007 --> 00:36:08,341
That's all I want to say.

824
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:10,876
I just want to tell him
to his face that I hate him.

825
00:36:13,413 --> 00:36:15,047
But he doesn't
even have a face.

826
00:36:16,583 --> 00:36:17,750
I'm sorry, mrs. Taylor.

827
00:36:17,784 --> 00:36:20,553
I'm--I'll see y'all
tomorrow.

828
00:36:20,587 --> 00:36:21,887
- Matt.

829
00:36:21,922 --> 00:36:23,122
Matt, you don't have to go.

830
00:36:23,156 --> 00:36:24,557
- It's all right.
- Matt!

831
00:36:24,591 --> 00:36:26,359
- Honey, honey.

832
00:36:26,393 --> 00:36:28,160
Come here, sweetie.
It's okay.

833
00:36:28,195 --> 00:36:29,495
- You're just gonna
let him go like that?

834
00:36:29,529 --> 00:36:30,963
- Shh.

835
00:36:30,998 --> 00:36:33,132
I'll get him.
I'll get him.

836
00:36:33,166 --> 00:36:34,967
It'll be all right.
It'll be all right.

837
00:36:35,002 --> 00:36:36,669
Be all right.

838
00:36:36,703 --> 00:36:38,104
Be all right.

839
00:36:38,138 --> 00:36:39,972
- It's okay.

840
00:36:40,007 --> 00:36:41,974
- I have to do something.

841
00:36:42,009 --> 00:36:44,443
I can't just let him
hurt like that.

842
00:36:46,146 --> 00:36:47,747
- Matt.

843
00:36:47,781 --> 00:36:49,749
Matt!

844
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:16,108
I'm gonna walk you home.

845
00:37:19,713 --> 00:37:21,981
- Okay.

846
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,123
- Looks good.
- It's pretty.

847
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:05,458
- Thank you.

848
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:55,207
- The picture.
Look at his picture.

849
00:38:55,242 --> 00:38:56,408
- Yeah.

850
00:38:56,443 --> 00:38:58,077
- Lead us not
into temptation,

851
00:38:58,111 --> 00:38:59,678
But deliver us
from evil.

852
00:38:59,713 --> 00:39:02,748
For thine is the kingdom
and the power

853
00:39:02,782 --> 00:39:04,683
And the glory forever
and ever.

854
00:39:04,718 --> 00:39:05,818
Amen.

855
00:39:05,852 --> 00:39:08,254
Now, matt would like to share

856
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:11,290
Some words of remembrance
with us.

857
00:39:16,463 --> 00:39:20,199
- Um...

858
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:24,303
I'm just gonna tell you
one story I remember,

859
00:39:24,337 --> 00:39:28,274
And that'll be it.

860
00:39:28,308 --> 00:39:31,477
We were at the...

861
00:39:31,511 --> 00:39:33,379
Supermarket.

862
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:38,050
It was me and my mom,

863
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:39,385
Grandma...

864
00:39:43,523 --> 00:39:44,924
And my dad--

865
00:39:44,958 --> 00:39:47,660
All four of us,
our whole family.

866
00:39:47,694 --> 00:39:49,228
My dad was pushing the cart,

867
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:52,031
And he stopped to grab
some toilet paper

868
00:39:52,065 --> 00:39:54,133
And put it in the cart,
and my grandma said,

869
00:39:54,167 --> 00:39:55,701
"no, that's not
the right one.

870
00:39:55,735 --> 00:40:00,005
That's not the right toilet
paper that we use."

871
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,540
She grabbed
the right toilet paper

872
00:40:01,575 --> 00:40:03,108
And put it in the cart

873
00:40:03,143 --> 00:40:06,812
And stormed off.

874
00:40:06,846 --> 00:40:09,715
And my dad just kinda
stared off at her.

875
00:40:09,749 --> 00:40:12,651
And then he just started
grabbing all the toilet paper

876
00:40:12,686 --> 00:40:15,554
Off the shelf
and putting it in the cart.

877
00:40:15,589 --> 00:40:17,223
I mean, he just
stacked it full of--

878
00:40:17,257 --> 00:40:18,891
And it wasn't spiteful
or nothing.

879
00:40:18,925 --> 00:40:20,392
He--

880
00:40:20,427 --> 00:40:22,494
I don't know,
maybe you had to be there,

881
00:40:22,529 --> 00:40:24,697
But as a six-year-old,

882
00:40:24,731 --> 00:40:27,333
It was the funniest thing
I'd ever seen in my life,

883
00:40:27,367 --> 00:40:29,335
And I just laughed about it
for weeks.

884
00:40:31,871 --> 00:40:34,807
I guess...

885
00:40:34,841 --> 00:40:39,478
My dad was just a funnier
person than he really let on.

886
00:40:39,512 --> 00:40:41,513
He was kinda private
in that way,

887
00:40:41,548 --> 00:40:45,351
And I don't really know y.

888
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:49,455
But one thing
that he wasn't private about

889
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:51,223
Was his service.

890
00:40:51,258 --> 00:40:53,859
He was in the army
for 20 years,

891
00:40:53,893 --> 00:40:56,228
And that was something
that he was--

892
00:40:56,263 --> 00:40:58,831
He was proud of.

893
00:40:58,865 --> 00:41:01,800
And he missed--

894
00:41:01,835 --> 00:41:03,736
He missed
some of my birthdays,

895
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:05,904
And he missed

896
00:41:05,939 --> 00:41:10,409
A lot of me growing up.

897
00:41:10,443 --> 00:41:14,480
But I think the point
is that I got to grow up.

898
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:16,582
And I got to have
those birthdays.

899
00:41:18,885 --> 00:41:20,686
You know,
he went and did a job

900
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:25,357
That not many people
want to do.

901
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,261
Because of that,
we all get to be here,

902
00:41:29,296 --> 00:41:30,429
And we get to grow up,

903
00:41:30,463 --> 00:41:32,631
And we get to have
our birthdays.

904
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:40,506
And I think that's
something to be proud of.

905
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:45,744
So thank you
for being here.

906
00:41:45,779 --> 00:41:48,247
And my family thanks you.

907
00:41:48,281 --> 00:41:56,522
âª âª

908
00:41:59,759 --> 00:42:01,860
- On behalf of the president
of the United States

909
00:42:01,895 --> 00:42:03,262
And our grateful nation,

910
00:42:03,296 --> 00:42:05,731
For the faithful service
rendered by your loved one.

911
00:42:05,765 --> 00:42:08,367
- Thank you.

912
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:09,702
Thank you.

913
00:42:12,605 --> 00:42:16,075
- Fire.
[gunshot]

914
00:42:16,109 --> 00:42:18,243
Fire.
[gunshot]

915
00:42:18,278 --> 00:42:21,714
Fire.
[gunshot]

916
00:42:21,748 --> 00:42:23,749
- Y'all are invited now

917
00:42:23,783 --> 00:42:26,085
To the saracen house
for a reception.

918
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:28,654
So we hope to see you there.
