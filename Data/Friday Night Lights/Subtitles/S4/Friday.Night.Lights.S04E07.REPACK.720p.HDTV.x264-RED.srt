1
00:00:00,065 --> 00:00:01,699
Kissing you was great.

2
00:00:01,733 --> 00:00:02,900
- Uh
-huh.

3
00:00:02,934 --> 00:00:04,435
There's this part of me

4
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:07,838
That's still hung up on this other girl.

5
00:00:07,873 --> 00:00:09,607
Touchdown, east dillon!

6
00:00:09,641 --> 00:00:12,343
Looks like the lions may
have found a quarterback

7
00:00:12,377 --> 00:00:14,378
That is the real deal.

8
00:00:14,412 --> 00:00:15,779
Maybe I should have left already.

9
00:00:15,814 --> 00:00:17,014
Do you even want me to stay?

10
00:00:17,048 --> 00:00:19,016
Of course I want you to stay!

11
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,685
He's leaving. He's really leaving.

12
00:00:42,707 --> 00:00:44,341
hey.

13
00:00:44,376 --> 00:00:46,677
I'm trying to hear if she's still crying.

14
00:00:46,711 --> 00:00:47,845
Take her.

15
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:49,680
he'll call eventually.

16
00:00:49,714 --> 00:00:52,983
He hasn't called yet.

17
00:00:53,018 --> 00:00:56,654
- You want some coffee?
- Yes, please.

18
00:00:56,688 --> 00:00:58,589
Hi, sweetie.

19
00:00:58,623 --> 00:01:01,525
- Hey.
- How you doing?

20
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,194
Fine.

21
00:01:05,597 --> 00:01:06,697
Go, cattle, go, cattle!

22
00:01:06,731 --> 00:01:09,867
Sook, sook, whoop! Hup, hup!

23
00:01:09,901 --> 00:01:11,869
We'll be all right, maggie.
Yep! Get up, cow!

24
00:01:11,903 --> 00:01:14,371
They can't get out, they can't get stolen.

25
00:01:14,406 --> 00:01:16,373
What kind of an idiot
would steal these cows?

26
00:01:16,408 --> 00:01:18,442
- Cow rustlers.
- Cow rustlers?

27
00:01:18,476 --> 00:01:20,344
What is this, the wild west? This sucks.

28
00:01:20,378 --> 00:01:23,180
Luke, don't say sucks. Have a vocabulary.

29
00:01:23,215 --> 00:01:24,949
I'm sorry, mom.

30
00:01:24,983 --> 00:01:26,016
Luke and I'll get that fence fixed.

31
00:01:26,051 --> 00:01:27,384
We'll be fine.

32
00:01:27,419 --> 00:01:29,687
Luke, you'd best plan on
missing some school this week.

33
00:01:29,721 --> 00:01:31,288
You want me to miss school for a week

34
00:01:31,323 --> 00:01:33,057
'cause some idiot's been
stealing our cows, dad?

35
00:01:33,091 --> 00:01:34,491
I got to go to school.

36
00:01:34,526 --> 00:01:36,293
If I don't go to school,
they won't let me practice.

37
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:38,762
We got a huge game coming up.
I got to practice.

38
00:01:38,797 --> 00:01:40,197
We can win this game.

39
00:01:40,232 --> 00:01:42,066
I'd hire someone if I could, luke.

40
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,569
We don't have any money.
What do you want me to say?

41
00:01:45,604 --> 00:01:47,104
Yah!

42
00:01:47,138 --> 00:01:49,306
Go.

43
00:01:49,341 --> 00:01:50,975
You saw, yeah?

44
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:53,344
wait, shh, shh, shh.

45
00:01:53,378 --> 00:01:55,746
- What's going on?
- Nothing is going on...

46
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,749
Except for the fact that you
won us a blue ribbon award

47
00:01:58,783 --> 00:02:00,618
For academic excellence!

48
00:02:03,154 --> 00:02:05,656
- Congratulations, tami.
- Take a look.

49
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:06,890
Tami, one year as principal,

50
00:02:06,925 --> 00:02:08,826
And you got dillon the blue ribbon award.

51
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,893
Incredible.

52
00:02:09,928 --> 00:02:12,162
Dillon high is a blue ribbon school.

53
00:02:12,197 --> 00:02:14,498
This is great news!

54
00:02:14,532 --> 00:02:16,033
How about that? - It's yours!

55
00:02:17,469 --> 00:02:20,604
He's here, he's here, he's here!

56
00:02:22,807 --> 00:02:25,643
Daddy!

57
00:02:25,677 --> 00:02:27,211
Ha ha!

58
00:02:27,245 --> 00:02:29,280
oh, he's cute!

59
00:02:29,314 --> 00:02:31,115
Hey.

60
00:02:31,149 --> 00:02:32,950
- I missed you.
- Look at you!

61
00:02:32,984 --> 00:02:35,552
Look the hell at you! Stop growing up.

62
00:02:35,587 --> 00:02:37,321
Oh, well, there's not
much I can do about that.

63
00:02:37,355 --> 00:02:39,356
- Hey.
- Hey, cheryl.

64
00:02:39,391 --> 00:02:40,691
Put your stuff in the guest room.

65
00:02:40,725 --> 00:02:41,892
I rented out the airstream.

66
00:02:41,926 --> 00:02:43,260
You all set? You got to go to school.

67
00:02:43,295 --> 00:02:45,062
I've been driving all night.
I'll take her.

68
00:02:45,096 --> 00:02:46,664
Well, you know what?
We got all her stuff ready.

69
00:02:46,698 --> 00:02:48,832
Go settle in. You'll see her later.

70
00:02:48,867 --> 00:02:50,200
Come on, becky. - All right.

71
00:02:50,235 --> 00:02:52,403
- Bye.
- Bye, bye.

72
00:02:53,905 --> 00:02:55,706
How you doing?

73
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,775
You threnter?

74
00:02:57,809 --> 00:02:59,843
I am, yeah. Just...

75
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:03,113
I'm tim, by the way.

76
00:03:03,148 --> 00:03:05,349
Nice to meet you.

77
00:03:11,523 --> 00:03:13,624
Let's go, bring it in!

78
00:03:13,658 --> 00:03:16,160
Come on, let's go.

79
00:03:16,194 --> 00:03:18,362
Hey, listen now.

80
00:03:18,396 --> 00:03:21,465
Campo park--two weeks.

81
00:03:21,499 --> 00:03:24,034
This is a game we are gonna win.

82
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:25,569
And I'll tell you something,

83
00:03:25,603 --> 00:03:29,340
We're gonna be going into this
game a little bit different.

84
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,945
You've got about 30 seconds

85
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:36,447
Before this gentleman puts on that uniform

86
00:03:36,481 --> 00:03:37,848
And get some licks on him,

87
00:03:37,882 --> 00:03:39,883
'cause you're looking
at our new quarterback.

88
00:03:44,723 --> 00:03:47,925
Let's go. We got work to do!

90
00:04:38,076 --> 00:04:39,443
Um, julie may I ask...

91
00:04:39,477 --> 00:04:41,078
Why you are signing up

92
00:04:41,112 --> 00:04:43,380
For every club that is available?

93
00:04:43,415 --> 00:04:45,048
'cause I can.

94
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,383
You're really signing up

95
00:04:46,418 --> 00:04:48,118
For the school beautification committee?

96
00:04:48,153 --> 00:04:49,920
And you're signing up for the book club,

97
00:04:49,954 --> 00:04:51,422
Which would normally be fine,

98
00:04:51,456 --> 00:04:54,124
<i>Except for this week's
book is twilight.</i>

99
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:56,293
Just leave me alone, okay?

100
00:04:56,327 --> 00:04:59,496
You do realize that he was
my best friend too, you know?

101
00:04:59,531 --> 00:05:01,632
Yep. And that's why I signed you up

102
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,634
For the academic smackdown.

103
00:05:03,668 --> 00:05:06,403
- What is that?
- It's like quiz bowl.

104
00:05:06,438 --> 00:05:09,039
It's after school.
I'll see you in the cafeteria.

105
00:05:11,476 --> 00:05:12,943
Right. Well, I--

106
00:05:12,977 --> 00:05:15,412
Yeah. We got the invoice two days ago.

107
00:05:15,447 --> 00:05:17,347
Well, I can't pay the invoice a week ago

108
00:05:17,382 --> 00:05:19,349
If I just got it two days ago.

109
00:05:19,384 --> 00:05:20,884
Hang on one second, would you, please?

110
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:22,686
Come here.

111
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,955
You were absent today.
You can't go to practice.

112
00:05:24,989 --> 00:05:26,323
You got a good excuse? - Yes, sir.

113
00:05:26,357 --> 00:05:28,358
My dad's making me fix our fence at home.

114
00:05:28,393 --> 00:05:29,827
- You have to fix a fence?
- Yeah.

115
00:05:29,861 --> 00:05:32,162
- Are you kidding with me?
- We don't have any money.

116
00:05:32,197 --> 00:05:34,598
We can't hire nobody.
Can I tell you something?

117
00:05:34,632 --> 00:05:36,633
We need you. You understand that?

118
00:05:36,668 --> 00:05:38,335
You're absent, you can't come to practice.

119
00:05:38,369 --> 00:05:40,304
You can't come to practice,
you're not playing.

120
00:05:40,338 --> 00:05:42,606
So here's what you need to do.
You need to fix your fence.

121
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,374
You can fix it in the middle
of the night--I don't care.

122
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:46,210
You can fix it in the morning
before you come to school.

123
00:05:46,244 --> 00:05:48,111
But you make it to school on time.

124
00:05:48,146 --> 00:05:50,013
You get here on time. You go to practice.

125
00:05:50,048 --> 00:05:52,049
- Okay.
- Good. I'll see you tomorrow.

126
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,684
Don't be absent again.

127
00:05:53,718 --> 00:05:55,819
Go.

128
00:05:55,854 --> 00:05:57,321
Hey, you there?

129
00:05:57,355 --> 00:05:59,990
Yeah, listen, we just
got the invoice, though.

130
00:06:01,826 --> 00:06:03,694
Hey, move that piece already!

131
00:06:03,728 --> 00:06:05,395
- Calm down!
- Hey! Stop.

132
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,564
- What?
- I got a buck.

133
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:09,900
Sorry...Funding right now.

134
00:06:09,934 --> 00:06:11,869
Billy I need more. One sec.

135
00:06:11,903 --> 00:06:13,737
God, the baby's-- baby on board.

136
00:06:13,771 --> 00:06:15,506
$1.75.

137
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,875
It's that simple. - I got it, 37 cents.

138
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:18,876
- Oh, god!
- What?

139
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:21,044
- No, please stop.
- Calm down!

140
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:22,679
What is wrong with you? - Contraction.

141
00:06:22,714 --> 00:06:24,848
Oh, god! - Still not there? What?

142
00:06:24,883 --> 00:06:26,850
- Contraction.
- You're seven months pregnant.

143
00:06:26,885 --> 00:06:28,485
You're not contracting.
Please go to the hospital.

144
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,720
- We got food right here--
- oh!

145
00:06:29,754 --> 00:06:31,522
Oh, god. Please go.

146
00:06:31,556 --> 00:06:33,156
- Get the food.
- Oh, god!

147
00:06:33,191 --> 00:06:34,691
thanks.

148
00:06:34,726 --> 00:06:38,495
Go, go, go, go, go!

149
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:39,830
Uh! Oh...

150
00:06:39,864 --> 00:06:41,865
- You okay?
- Oh, god!

151
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,267
Do you have any idea

152
00:06:43,301 --> 00:06:46,837
What kind of losers are gonna
be at academic smackdown?

153
00:06:46,871 --> 00:06:50,007
You realize the irony behind
the term academic smackdown?

154
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:53,076
Shut up, landry.

155
00:06:57,649 --> 00:06:58,615
Hey.

156
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:00,083
goody.

157
00:07:00,118 --> 00:07:02,419
Is this one taken here?

158
00:07:05,056 --> 00:07:06,957
Fancy seeing you here.

159
00:07:06,991 --> 00:07:10,360
This isn't gonna be awkward
or anything, is it?

160
00:07:10,395 --> 00:07:13,430
Well, if it's gonna be
awkward for you, you can leave.

161
00:07:13,464 --> 00:07:15,299
I do this smackdown every single year,

162
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:18,569
So you being here is of
no consequence to me.

163
00:07:19,971 --> 00:07:21,638
Hey.

164
00:07:21,673 --> 00:07:25,909
Welcome to east dillon
academic smackdown team...

165
00:07:25,944 --> 00:07:27,744
Who have an event this weekend

166
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:30,080
Against another school in our district

167
00:07:30,114 --> 00:07:33,417
At west dillon, our sister school,

168
00:07:33,451 --> 00:07:35,886
Our blue ribbon sister school.

169
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,388
I need you to perform well at this.

170
00:07:38,423 --> 00:07:40,223
All right, study.

171
00:07:40,258 --> 00:07:42,726
This is exciting.

172
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,095
Learning...

173
00:07:47,498 --> 00:07:50,467
Your mom is gonna kill me.

174
00:07:50,501 --> 00:07:52,803
Well, what's she gonna do, divorce you?

175
00:07:52,837 --> 00:07:55,472
Oh, wait. She already did that.

176
00:07:55,506 --> 00:07:57,608
A dog's a lot of work, beck.

177
00:07:57,642 --> 00:07:59,676
A lot of work. - I know.

178
00:07:59,711 --> 00:08:01,011
I can do it.

179
00:08:01,045 --> 00:08:04,681
Besides, I get really
lonely when mom's at work.

180
00:08:04,716 --> 00:08:08,151
Do you ever think you're gonna move home?

181
00:08:08,186 --> 00:08:11,154
I mean, I know you and mom
aren't gonna get back together,

182
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:15,025
But if you lived in town,
we could see each other more.

183
00:08:15,059 --> 00:08:16,693
Give me a little time, all right?

184
00:08:16,728 --> 00:08:19,363
I'm working on it.

185
00:08:19,397 --> 00:08:20,831
Puppies!

186
00:08:20,865 --> 00:08:23,800
I like this one.

187
00:08:25,303 --> 00:08:27,571
- He's gonna do 50 sit-ups in 30 seconds.

188
00:08:27,605 --> 00:08:29,506
Hit the floor. Let's go.
You're challenging me.

189
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,643
Yeah. Let's go. You ready?

190
00:08:32,677 --> 00:08:35,245
- You ready?
- Go.

191
00:08:47,825 --> 00:08:49,526
Coach.

192
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,861
Hey, levi--

193
00:08:50,895 --> 00:08:52,996
Hey.

194
00:08:53,031 --> 00:08:56,033
- Gentlemen.
- We need to see vincent howard.

195
00:08:56,067 --> 00:08:57,701
What's going on?

196
00:08:57,735 --> 00:09:00,003
We got a report that he
had a gun on school grounds.

197
00:09:00,038 --> 00:09:01,938
These officers need to search his locker.

198
00:09:01,973 --> 00:09:03,507
Report from who?

199
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:06,276
We need to check the locker.

200
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:07,878
Well, look, maybe we should, uh...

201
00:09:07,912 --> 00:09:09,179
- Coach...
- Clear something--

202
00:09:09,213 --> 00:09:12,249
The police are here.

203
00:09:18,456 --> 00:09:21,892
Second one on the end.

204
00:09:23,461 --> 00:09:25,896
It's got a name on it.

205
00:09:55,093 --> 00:09:58,261
- It's clean.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

206
00:09:58,296 --> 00:10:01,798
I'll meet you in front.

207
00:10:16,247 --> 00:10:18,648
All right, dad, I'll be back later.

208
00:10:18,683 --> 00:10:20,484
- Where you going?
- School, dad.

209
00:10:20,518 --> 00:10:21,651
I'm going to school.

210
00:10:21,686 --> 00:10:23,286
Luke, get back here.

211
00:10:23,321 --> 00:10:26,256
Dad, I cannot miss practice.

212
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,891
I cannot miss school.
I will build your fence.

213
00:10:27,925 --> 00:10:29,726
I'll stay up till midnight.
I will get up at dawn.

214
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:31,995
But I'm going to school.

215
00:10:32,029 --> 00:10:34,931
Luke, you get your ass back here now.

216
00:10:34,966 --> 00:10:38,502
I'll be back later, dad.

217
00:10:38,536 --> 00:10:40,804
son of a bitch.

218
00:10:40,838 --> 00:10:43,006
I want to admit you to
the hospital overnight.

219
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,775
She needs to be on the magnesium sulfate

220
00:10:44,809 --> 00:10:46,977
For at least 24 hours.

221
00:10:47,011 --> 00:10:48,678
Everything's gonna be okay, right?

222
00:10:48,713 --> 00:10:51,081
I mean, the baby and everything.
She's gonna be fine.

223
00:10:51,115 --> 00:10:54,351
It should be, but she's going
to need to go on bed rest.

224
00:10:54,385 --> 00:10:55,519
Okay, um...

225
00:10:55,553 --> 00:10:57,487
For how long? - For two months.

226
00:10:57,522 --> 00:10:58,855
Until the baby's full-term.

227
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:02,259
I'll check back with you later.

228
00:11:02,293 --> 00:11:04,094
Oh, my god.

229
00:11:04,128 --> 00:11:06,530
Everything's gonna be fine, okay?

230
00:11:06,564 --> 00:11:08,198
You aren't gonna have to do anything.

231
00:11:08,232 --> 00:11:10,033
Me and tim are gonna
take care of everything.

232
00:11:10,067 --> 00:11:13,503
You won't have to lift a finger, all right?

233
00:11:13,538 --> 00:11:15,639
Uh, doc? Doc.

234
00:11:15,673 --> 00:11:17,874
Uh, look...

235
00:11:17,909 --> 00:11:20,043
I don't exactly have insurance right now.

236
00:11:20,077 --> 00:11:23,346
I mean, I was--I was gonna pay
for the birth out of pocket,

237
00:11:23,381 --> 00:11:26,683
But, uh, I wasn't exactly
expecting it to cost this much.

238
00:11:26,717 --> 00:11:28,685
Is there anything...

239
00:11:28,719 --> 00:11:32,289
We might be able to work out
or some kind of deal or...?

240
00:11:32,323 --> 00:11:35,358
Uh, you know, it-- it costs what it costs.

241
00:11:35,393 --> 00:11:39,029
There are payment plans, but still...

242
00:11:39,063 --> 00:11:40,630
The contractions are waning.

243
00:11:40,665 --> 00:11:42,666
You can take her home
and keep her on her side

244
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,167
And well-hydrated.

245
00:11:44,202 --> 00:11:46,269
It may be enough.

246
00:11:46,304 --> 00:11:50,340
Then, um...We'll keep her here overnight.

247
00:11:50,374 --> 00:11:52,075
Uh, you know, premature labor

248
00:11:52,109 --> 00:11:54,878
Is something that usually
happens more than once.

249
00:11:54,912 --> 00:11:56,813
Okay? - Yeah.

250
00:11:59,617 --> 00:12:01,251
What am I supposed to do? It's the police.

251
00:12:01,285 --> 00:12:03,286
It's not like I have
much of a choice anyway.

252
00:12:03,321 --> 00:12:05,355
No...I mean, I guess not.
I mean, I don't know.

253
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:07,524
You know, if they'd come in saying...

254
00:12:07,558 --> 00:12:08,658
Open up landry's locker,

255
00:12:08,693 --> 00:12:10,427
Would you have just done that?

256
00:12:10,461 --> 00:12:12,762
I don't know what I would have done then.

257
00:12:12,797 --> 00:12:15,432
I think the real question is
do you think that he has a gun?

258
00:12:15,466 --> 00:12:17,467
Well, I sure as hell hope not.

259
00:12:17,501 --> 00:12:20,003
But do you think it's possible?

260
00:12:20,037 --> 00:12:23,373
I-I don't know, honey.
Anything's possible, isn't it?

261
00:12:23,407 --> 00:12:25,709
Seems like maybe you
ought to just ask him.

262
00:12:25,743 --> 00:12:27,944
I mean, he's never gonna trust
you unless you trust him.

263
00:12:27,979 --> 00:12:29,579
You know what I mean?

264
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:33,950
Okay.

265
00:12:33,985 --> 00:12:36,019
What year was the battle of stalingrad?

266
00:12:36,053 --> 00:12:37,821
19...1941.

267
00:12:37,855 --> 00:12:39,990
- Wrong.
- 1942.

268
00:12:40,024 --> 00:12:42,158
- Thank you.
- Can you lighten up?

269
00:12:42,193 --> 00:12:43,960
Jeez, you're making me go blank.

270
00:12:43,995 --> 00:12:45,028
I'm making you go blank?

271
00:12:45,062 --> 00:12:46,496
How do you think you're gonna feel

272
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:48,732
When you're having to answer these questions

273
00:12:48,766 --> 00:12:50,834
In front of all those people? - Shh!

274
00:12:50,868 --> 00:12:52,535
Hey, julie. Hey, come here.
Hey, come here.

275
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,070
These are very basic
questions I'm asking right now.

276
00:12:54,105 --> 00:12:55,705
Julie, come here and let
me tell you something.

277
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,407
What? He knows nothing about world war ii!

278
00:12:57,441 --> 00:12:59,309
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come here, come here.

279
00:12:59,343 --> 00:13:00,343
What?

280
00:13:00,378 --> 00:13:02,812
Take a deep breath, okay?

281
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,781
I understand that you're
going through a lot,

282
00:13:04,815 --> 00:13:06,349
That you're in a lot of pain--

283
00:13:06,384 --> 00:13:07,751
This has nothing to do with matt.

284
00:13:07,785 --> 00:13:10,353
I want to do well on the smackdown, okay?

285
00:13:10,388 --> 00:13:11,888
- You know what? Just--
- you're lying, it's about matt.

286
00:13:11,923 --> 00:13:13,790
Just climb off my back,
okay? It's not about matt.

287
00:13:13,824 --> 00:13:16,092
Just deal with the fact that it's about--

288
00:13:20,231 --> 00:13:21,865
Vince.

289
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:24,367
Come here.

290
00:13:26,137 --> 00:13:29,639
Close the door.

291
00:13:29,674 --> 00:13:32,809
Sit down. - What's up?

292
00:13:37,415 --> 00:13:39,582
How you doing?

293
00:13:39,617 --> 00:13:40,884
I'm good.

294
00:13:40,918 --> 00:13:44,187
A little sore, but I'm good.

295
00:13:44,221 --> 00:13:46,356
I got to ask you a question.

296
00:13:52,363 --> 00:13:54,764
You got a gun?

297
00:13:56,968 --> 00:14:00,704
I'm just asking you straight up.
Have you got a gun?

298
00:14:00,738 --> 00:14:02,539
Do you have gun, do you carry a gun,

299
00:14:02,573 --> 00:14:03,940
Do you have a gun in your locker,

300
00:14:03,975 --> 00:14:05,775
Do you have a gun on the
premises--I don't know.

301
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:08,845
A gun. Give me an answer. Talk to me.

302
00:14:10,982 --> 00:14:12,282
No.

303
00:14:12,316 --> 00:14:15,185
No, I ain't got no gun.

304
00:14:19,256 --> 00:14:21,424
That's all I wanted to know.

305
00:14:24,662 --> 00:14:28,498
I don't know.
Do the swaddle-and-shush thing.

306
00:14:28,532 --> 00:14:31,601
Babe, I don't know.
I'm not a friggin' midwife.

307
00:14:31,635 --> 00:14:33,236
So I don't know.

308
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,472
I'll be home in a few days, all right?

309
00:14:35,506 --> 00:14:38,108
Then I'm yours. Yeah, yours and the baby's.

310
00:14:38,142 --> 00:14:39,576
All right, yeah.

311
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:42,779
Love--love you back.

312
00:14:42,813 --> 00:14:45,749
Trouble at home, huh?

313
00:14:45,783 --> 00:14:48,518
Uh... Becky says you were, uh,

314
00:14:48,552 --> 00:14:51,121
Some kind of big football deal around here.

315
00:14:51,155 --> 00:14:52,956
Is that it? - Something like that.

316
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:55,158
Yeah. I bet that was
pretty good times, huh?

317
00:14:55,192 --> 00:14:56,993
Yeah, it had its moments.

318
00:14:57,028 --> 00:14:58,862
you're young yet. It'll change.

319
00:14:58,896 --> 00:15:00,730
Believe me. You're not married, are you?

320
00:15:00,765 --> 00:15:03,466
- - Don't ever get married.

321
00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:05,068
Don't ever have kids.

322
00:15:05,102 --> 00:15:08,371
You don't like your kids?

323
00:15:08,406 --> 00:15:10,407
No, I love my kids.

324
00:15:10,441 --> 00:15:12,909
It's just that it-- it never ends.

325
00:15:12,943 --> 00:15:16,079
Right. I mean... A baby and all.

326
00:15:16,113 --> 00:15:18,281
I'm sure it's a lot.

327
00:15:20,117 --> 00:15:21,551
All right, look,

328
00:15:21,585 --> 00:15:24,154
I got a baby with this girl in seattle.

329
00:15:24,188 --> 00:15:26,623
You know how it goes, right? - Hmm.

330
00:15:26,657 --> 00:15:28,391
Now she wants to get married.

331
00:15:28,426 --> 00:15:30,126
There's just never enough to go around.

332
00:15:30,161 --> 00:15:33,096
Yeah. You're spreading
yourself pretty thin.

333
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:35,498
Becky know about seattle? - Oh, no, no.

334
00:15:35,533 --> 00:15:38,768
No. No. And I don't want her to.

335
00:15:38,803 --> 00:15:40,336
It was a present!

336
00:15:40,371 --> 00:15:42,872
Forget it! I'm walking!

337
00:15:42,907 --> 00:15:44,841
I'm not going anywhere with you!

338
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,643
Becky, you are being ridiculous.

339
00:15:46,677 --> 00:15:48,678
- Cheryl, what the hell--
- you've got one hell of a nerve

340
00:15:48,712 --> 00:15:50,346
Bringing that dog in here without asking.

341
00:15:50,381 --> 00:15:52,248
There's nothing wrong with
her having a little dog.

342
00:16:18,676 --> 00:16:20,443
Julie.

343
00:16:20,478 --> 00:16:23,279
Julie taylor. - Hey, mrs. Saracen.

344
00:16:23,314 --> 00:16:26,683
Oh, it's so good to see you.
Come in here, sweetie.

345
00:16:26,717 --> 00:16:28,585
Shelby, look who's here. It's julie.

346
00:16:28,619 --> 00:16:29,686
- Hi.
- Hey.

347
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,788
Oh, it's so good to see you.

348
00:16:31,822 --> 00:16:33,656
- How you doing?
- Good.

349
00:16:33,691 --> 00:16:35,959
Well, we're doing just fine, honey.

350
00:16:35,993 --> 00:16:39,062
Shelby here, she's taking
real good care of me.

351
00:16:39,096 --> 00:16:40,964
Well, I'm trying.

352
00:16:40,998 --> 00:16:42,432
That's good to hear.

353
00:16:42,466 --> 00:16:46,369
I'm sure this whole matt
thing must be so hard on you.

354
00:16:46,403 --> 00:16:48,671
Oh, lord, julie, at first...

355
00:16:48,706 --> 00:16:50,673
It was just awful.

356
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:53,009
But, you know, now that I know he's fine,

357
00:16:53,043 --> 00:16:55,845
Then I'm fine.

358
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,714
- You talked to matt?
- Oh, yeah.

359
00:16:57,748 --> 00:16:59,616
He even called again yesterday,
bless his heart,

360
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,284
And let us know he got the place.

361
00:17:01,318 --> 00:17:03,319
He told you, I'm sure.

362
00:17:03,354 --> 00:17:06,489
Yeah, he did.

363
00:17:06,524 --> 00:17:08,158
Well, you know what?

364
00:17:08,192 --> 00:17:10,927
We were just about to have
an ice cream sandwich.

365
00:17:10,961 --> 00:17:12,162
Let me get you one.

366
00:17:12,196 --> 00:17:13,796
hey.

367
00:17:13,831 --> 00:17:16,232
He's just going through a lot, you know?

368
00:17:16,267 --> 00:17:19,435
He'll call. He'll be in touch soon.

369
00:17:33,751 --> 00:17:37,353
* *

370
00:17:37,388 --> 00:17:39,355
You're broke. I'm broke.

371
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,491
We got to sell something.
What do we have to sell, tim?

372
00:17:41,525 --> 00:17:43,993
We don't have anything
to sell besides kit kat.

373
00:17:44,028 --> 00:17:46,529
No. We're not selling kit kat.
He's the face of riggins' rigs.

374
00:17:46,564 --> 00:17:47,764
You're right. You're right.

375
00:17:47,798 --> 00:17:49,365
I love that damn cow.

376
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,467
Cheers, boys. Couple beers on me.

377
00:17:51,502 --> 00:17:53,603
- Thank you, thank you.
- How's my girl doing?

378
00:17:53,637 --> 00:17:55,138
She's doing good. She's doing better.

379
00:17:55,172 --> 00:17:57,273
I mean, her mom's taking
care of her right now,

380
00:17:57,308 --> 00:17:58,541
Give tim and I a little break

381
00:17:58,576 --> 00:18:00,810
From the ringing of the
bell every five seconds.

382
00:18:00,844 --> 00:18:02,145
That bell...

383
00:18:02,179 --> 00:18:04,013
What? I don't want her
to stress out about things.

384
00:18:04,048 --> 00:18:05,448
Hey, me and the girls been talking,

385
00:18:05,482 --> 00:18:07,951
And we want to throw mindy a baby shower.

386
00:18:07,985 --> 00:18:09,452
- Oh, that's really nice.
- Sweet.

387
00:18:09,486 --> 00:18:11,254
Okay, but we also want
to tie in a fundraiser.

388
00:18:11,288 --> 00:18:15,124
Make it a co-ed shower,
girls dance and whatnot,

389
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:17,327
Guys pay admission and whatnot.

390
00:18:17,361 --> 00:18:20,430
All the proceeds go to help mindy, baby,

391
00:18:20,464 --> 00:18:22,765
And all the medical bills.

392
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,934
- Yeah. No, I-I like this.

393
00:18:24,969 --> 00:18:27,237
I mean, mindy and I have been
friends since she was 17, okay?

394
00:18:27,271 --> 00:18:29,472
She's like a sister to me.
I want to do this.

395
00:18:29,506 --> 00:18:31,774
Where--where would we do it, though?

396
00:18:31,809 --> 00:18:34,277
- Your place isn't big enough?
- Not for something like thi

397
00:18:34,311 --> 00:18:35,845
- I can't host it.
- No, he can't host it.

398
00:18:35,879 --> 00:18:40,116
He lives in a trailer. - uh, yeah...

399
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,252
What about...? - Riggins' rigs.

400
00:18:42,286 --> 00:18:44,087
That may be the smartest thing

401
00:18:44,121 --> 00:18:45,655
You've ever said in your whole entire life.

402
00:18:45,689 --> 00:18:47,957
- That could work.
- Riggins' rigs.

403
00:18:47,992 --> 00:18:49,158
- Sounds like a plan, okay?
- Yeah.

404
00:18:49,193 --> 00:18:50,460
- Enjoy the beers.
- Thank you.

405
00:18:50,494 --> 00:18:52,028
Thank you. Great call.

406
00:18:52,062 --> 00:18:53,763
- Thank you, hannah!
- Yeah.

407
00:18:53,797 --> 00:18:55,431
What about stephen crane?

408
00:18:55,466 --> 00:18:57,800
Does anybody need to read
stephen crane anymore?

409
00:18:57,835 --> 00:18:59,802
You know, I think we can
do without stephen crane,

410
00:18:59,837 --> 00:19:01,537
Go on to something a little fresher.

411
00:19:01,572 --> 00:19:03,206
- Okay.
- Did you, uh, get a chance

412
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,308
To go out and celebrate last night?

413
00:19:05,342 --> 00:19:07,810
Um...Well, we kind of did.

414
00:19:07,845 --> 00:19:08,878
Kind of?

415
00:19:08,912 --> 00:19:10,913
We had a little dinner last night.

416
00:19:10,948 --> 00:19:13,850
There's a lot going on in
my house at the moment.

417
00:19:13,884 --> 00:19:15,051
There's a lot going on, so it was...

418
00:19:15,085 --> 00:19:16,486
Sort of a celebration.

419
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,655
Well, you know, I mean,
this is kind of a big deal.

420
00:19:18,689 --> 00:19:20,790
You know, you ought to take a
night for yourself, go out,

421
00:19:20,824 --> 00:19:22,492
You know, cut it loose.

422
00:19:22,526 --> 00:19:23,960
How about this?

423
00:19:23,994 --> 00:19:25,295
What would you think

424
00:19:25,329 --> 00:19:27,630
If I got a group of the teachers together,

425
00:19:27,665 --> 00:19:30,333
Some of the staff, and all of us together--

426
00:19:30,367 --> 00:19:32,168
We went out, and we celebrated you

427
00:19:32,202 --> 00:19:33,736
And your accomplishment?

428
00:19:33,771 --> 00:19:35,338
I think that would be so much fun.

429
00:19:35,372 --> 00:19:36,873
It doesn't have to be about me.

430
00:19:36,907 --> 00:19:38,441
I think it's about celebrating everybody.

431
00:19:38,475 --> 00:19:40,343
- Definitely.
- I think that's a great idea.

432
00:19:40,377 --> 00:19:43,746
How about this-- you,
me, the staff...Karaoke?

433
00:19:43,781 --> 00:19:45,915
- - let's do it.

434
00:19:45,949 --> 00:19:47,350
Yeah.

435
00:20:02,966 --> 00:20:05,368
Hey, man. What's going on, man?

436
00:20:05,402 --> 00:20:06,869
You dead or something?

437
00:20:06,904 --> 00:20:09,405
Doing this whole drun
k-out wino thing in the cafeteria, man,

438
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,507
That ain't gonna get you
nowhere with the ladies, dude.

439
00:20:11,542 --> 00:20:13,409
No, I was just-- I was up all night.

440
00:20:13,444 --> 00:20:15,611
Probably gonna be up all
night every night this week.

441
00:20:15,646 --> 00:20:17,180
So what the hell was you doing?

442
00:20:17,214 --> 00:20:19,182
Got to rebuild the entire
fence at the ranch, man.

443
00:20:19,216 --> 00:20:22,018
Some idiot's been stealing all the cows.

444
00:20:22,052 --> 00:20:23,453
Man, maybe I can ask the team.

445
00:20:23,487 --> 00:20:26,122
Maybe some of us come
out and give you a hand.

446
00:20:26,156 --> 00:20:27,690
Right. You think they'd do that?

447
00:20:27,725 --> 00:20:29,859
Man, I'll ask. It don't hurt to ask, dude.

448
00:20:29,893 --> 00:20:31,728
All right, you do that,

449
00:20:31,762 --> 00:20:34,430
And I'll just be here sleeping, all right?

450
00:20:34,465 --> 00:20:37,834
Okay, cool.

451
00:20:37,868 --> 00:20:39,435
Mmm. Damn.

452
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:42,739
These are pretty good fries. Mmm, mmm!

453
00:20:46,777 --> 00:20:49,946
- Can I help you?
- I'm vincent's mother...

454
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,314
Regina.

455
00:20:51,348 --> 00:20:54,817
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. How are you?

456
00:20:54,852 --> 00:20:56,252
I'm well.

457
00:20:56,286 --> 00:20:59,756
I'm afraid the last time
you saw me, I was, uh...

458
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:01,491
In not such good shape.

459
00:21:01,525 --> 00:21:03,292
Well, I'm working on it.

460
00:21:03,327 --> 00:21:05,161
That's good.

461
00:21:07,331 --> 00:21:11,834
I just wanted to come
by and say thank you...

462
00:21:11,869 --> 00:21:14,704
Thank you for making my son quarterback.

463
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,776
You know, things like that
ain't supposed to happen to us.

464
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:22,979
we don't get a lot of good breaks.

465
00:21:23,013 --> 00:21:25,615
You should have seen the look on his face

466
00:21:25,649 --> 00:21:28,684
When he told me, um...

467
00:21:28,719 --> 00:21:32,021
It was like he was a kid again.

468
00:21:32,055 --> 00:21:35,425
I haven't seen that face
in a really long time.

469
00:21:35,459 --> 00:21:38,961
I didn't give it to him. He earned it.

470
00:21:38,996 --> 00:21:43,633
I thank you... For believing in my boy.

471
00:21:43,667 --> 00:21:47,203
He's a good kid.

472
00:21:49,339 --> 00:21:52,208
* working at the car wash *

473
00:21:54,378 --> 00:21:55,978
* car wash *

474
00:21:56,013 --> 00:21:58,548
Whoo! Ooh, yeah!

475
00:21:58,582 --> 00:22:00,349
* work and work *

476
00:22:00,384 --> 00:22:01,884
* *

477
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,053
* at the car wash *

478
00:22:04,087 --> 00:22:05,455
* oh, yeah *

479
00:22:05,489 --> 00:22:08,391
- Whoo!
- Nice.

480
00:22:08,425 --> 00:22:11,260
That was great! I can't believe that.

481
00:22:11,295 --> 00:22:13,429
Have some shots coming
to the table, folks.

482
00:22:13,464 --> 00:22:15,698
Pass them around, pass them around.

483
00:22:15,732 --> 00:22:17,500
- Who ordered shots?
- I ordered shots.

484
00:22:17,534 --> 00:22:19,669
Everybody's taking a taxi home.

485
00:22:19,703 --> 00:22:21,103
That's it. Thank you, glenn.

486
00:22:21,138 --> 00:22:23,339
- Thank you!
- So I, uh...

487
00:22:23,373 --> 00:22:25,141
I would like to propose a toast.

488
00:22:25,175 --> 00:22:27,376
We've all been at dillon for a while now,

489
00:22:27,411 --> 00:22:29,378
And I think most of us know what it was like

490
00:22:29,413 --> 00:22:30,847
Before tami got here.

491
00:22:30,881 --> 00:22:33,082
- Yeah, it sucked.
- It did suck.

492
00:22:34,418 --> 00:22:36,219
But what matters most is that we all know

493
00:22:36,253 --> 00:22:37,620
What it's like now that you're here.

494
00:22:37,654 --> 00:22:38,955
To a job well done.

495
00:22:38,989 --> 00:22:41,224
Always smart, always professional.

496
00:22:41,258 --> 00:22:43,392
That's right, you get
the job done every time,

497
00:22:43,427 --> 00:22:46,295
In spite of all of that,
you know, that political crap

498
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:49,198
And that football stuff and just
the district and everything.

499
00:22:49,233 --> 00:22:50,800
- Oh, lord help us.
- No, I mean, it's--

500
00:22:50,834 --> 00:22:52,702
It's really meant a lot to us and to me.

501
00:22:52,736 --> 00:22:54,203
To you, to our fearless leader.

502
00:22:54,238 --> 00:22:56,606
Well, to all of y'all. To everybody.

503
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,241
Congratulations. - Cheers!

504
00:22:58,275 --> 00:23:00,910
- Well done.
- Cheers.

505
00:23:00,944 --> 00:23:02,645
* *

506
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:04,981
* hey, hey, hey, hey *

00:23:05,015 --> 00:23:06,916

00:23:17,828 --> 00:23:20,830
* won't you come see about me? *

512
00:23:20,864 --> 00:23:22,932

516
00:23:32,676 --> 00:23:33,643
* ha *

517
00:23:33,677 --> 00:23:36,479
Ah...

518
00:23:36,513 --> 00:23:38,881
When do you think the cabs come?

519
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:43,252
I don't know. They'll be here in a minute.

520
00:23:43,287 --> 00:23:45,555
That was, uh--that was
pretty awesome, wasn't it?

521
00:23:45,589 --> 00:23:47,089
That was really fun.

522
00:23:47,124 --> 00:23:49,158
We should do it more often, you know?

523
00:23:49,192 --> 00:23:50,793
We should do it all the time.

524
00:23:50,827 --> 00:23:52,795
Well, I don't know if you'll
feel that way tomorrow morning

525
00:23:52,829 --> 00:23:54,263
When you wake up and your head is banging...

526
00:23:54,298 --> 00:23:55,831
Be totally worth it.

527
00:23:55,866 --> 00:23:57,700
I wanted you to have a good night, you know?

528
00:23:57,734 --> 00:24:00,536
You're so sweet. Thank you.

529
00:24:00,571 --> 00:24:02,271
Well, there you go. The, uh...

530
00:24:02,306 --> 00:24:03,940
Oh, here's a cab. Great, great, great.

531
00:24:03,974 --> 00:24:06,709
You go ahead. I'll, um,
wait for the next one.

532
00:24:06,743 --> 00:24:08,077
All right, I'm gonna take you up on it,

533
00:24:08,111 --> 00:24:09,145
'cause you're a gentleman.

534
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:10,846
All right, thank you, that was--oh.

535
00:24:10,881 --> 00:24:12,949
It was such a-- such a fun thing,

536
00:24:12,983 --> 00:24:14,884
And it was good for everybody, I thought.

537
00:24:14,918 --> 00:24:16,719
You're the best, tami. You are the best.

538
00:24:16,753 --> 00:24:19,388
Thank you.

539
00:24:19,423 --> 00:24:22,124
Oh--glenn!

540
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,693
Oh...

541
00:24:23,727 --> 00:24:25,461
- I
-I'm so sorry.

542
00:24:25,495 --> 00:24:28,097
- No, it's okay, I--
- no, it's--

543
00:24:28,131 --> 00:24:30,333
You get yourself he safe, okay?

544
00:24:30,367 --> 00:24:32,735
I'll see--I'll see you at school, all right?

545
00:24:48,719 --> 00:24:51,554
Why are you here?

546
00:24:51,588 --> 00:24:55,224
How you doing?

547
00:24:58,762 --> 00:25:01,197
You like being quarterback?

548
00:25:01,231 --> 00:25:02,398
Yeah.

549
00:25:02,432 --> 00:25:03,966
Quarterback's a leader.

550
00:25:04,001 --> 00:25:06,535
Quarterback makes decisions, makes choices.

551
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:11,073
Quarterback has got to be clear
on what has got to be done.

552
00:25:11,108 --> 00:25:14,543
You've got to make a decision.

553
00:25:14,578 --> 00:25:18,014
Why do you care about what I do so much?

554
00:25:18,048 --> 00:25:19,548
What you getting out of this?

555
00:25:19,583 --> 00:25:21,450
Ain't I just another player
that can throw the ball

556
00:25:21,485 --> 00:25:22,918
And run fast?

557
00:25:22,953 --> 00:25:25,087
Coach, if I break my ankle and
can't play for you no more,

558
00:25:25,122 --> 00:25:26,689
You still gonna come around here?

559
00:25:26,723 --> 00:25:29,992
You still gonna check up on me?

560
00:25:30,027 --> 00:25:32,028
This is my life.

561
00:25:32,062 --> 00:25:34,764
I been living here ten years

562
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:36,432
And seen three of my best friends get killed

563
00:25:36,466 --> 00:25:38,734
Walking to school.

564
00:25:38,769 --> 00:25:40,736
When I leave your practice,

565
00:25:40,771 --> 00:25:42,538
I'm the one looking over my shoulder,

566
00:25:42,572 --> 00:25:44,373
Hoping I don't get jumped,

567
00:25:44,408 --> 00:25:47,043
Robbed, killed.

568
00:25:49,546 --> 00:25:52,048
You get in any more trouble with the law,

569
00:25:52,082 --> 00:25:53,683
You're going straight to juvie.

570
00:25:53,717 --> 00:25:56,252
Who puts the food up there on the table?

571
00:25:56,286 --> 00:25:59,288
Who makes sure the bills get paid?

572
00:26:02,793 --> 00:26:07,463
Who's gonna take care of
that if you're locked up?

573
00:26:07,497 --> 00:26:10,399
I'm offering you...

574
00:26:10,434 --> 00:26:12,735
Everything I got.

575
00:26:12,769 --> 00:26:17,406
This is not just about football.

576
00:26:17,441 --> 00:26:20,109
Think about that.

577
00:26:26,717 --> 00:26:31,053
I beg of you, think about what I just said.

578
00:26:41,798 --> 00:26:44,467
Welcome to the 2009 academic smackdown.

579
00:26:44,501 --> 00:26:45,634
Testing, testing.

580
00:26:45,669 --> 00:26:47,136
Hi, glenn.

581
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:49,171
Hey.

582
00:26:51,007 --> 00:26:52,174
How you doing today?

583
00:26:52,209 --> 00:26:54,276
Good. Good, good, good.

584
00:26:54,311 --> 00:26:56,946
Almost set up.

585
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,814
How you feeling today?

586
00:27:03,186 --> 00:27:04,954
I feel like the, uh...

587
00:27:04,988 --> 00:27:06,789
Like the biggest idiot that ever lived.

588
00:27:06,823 --> 00:27:08,858
- It's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

589
00:27:08,892 --> 00:27:11,660
I mean, I-I-I practically
raped you, you know?

590
00:27:11,695 --> 00:27:13,562
No, you didn't.

591
00:27:13,597 --> 00:27:15,131
Well, no, I mean, not-- not literally,

592
00:27:15,165 --> 00:27:17,032
But with my mouth-
it's like I mouth-raped you.

593
00:27:17,067 --> 00:27:18,901
- No.
- I can't believe I did that.

594
00:27:18,935 --> 00:27:20,469
I mean, I'm mr. Liberal, you know?

595
00:27:20,504 --> 00:27:23,806
I-I grab a beautiful married woman,

596
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,341
And I-I-I kiss her

597
00:27:25,375 --> 00:27:27,176
Like I'm some sort of, you know,

598
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:30,946
Neanderthal, unevolved caveman or something,

599
00:27:30,981 --> 00:27:32,748
And I am not that type of person.

600
00:27:32,783 --> 00:27:34,450
I'm not somebody who
does something like that.

601
00:27:34,484 --> 00:27:35,684
I know. Glenn, I know.

602
00:27:35,719 --> 00:27:37,820
I don't want you to beat
yourself up about it.

603
00:27:37,854 --> 00:27:40,456
Listen, you did such a nice
thing for all those people

604
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:42,191
Last night, for me and for everybody,

605
00:27:42,225 --> 00:27:45,795
And it was such a nice
party that you planned.

606
00:27:45,829 --> 00:27:47,563
And--and that last part...

607
00:27:47,597 --> 00:27:50,299
Can't ever happen again, that's all.

608
00:28:27,537 --> 00:28:35,544
* *

609
00:29:00,503 --> 00:29:03,305
Okay, this is for east dillon high.

610
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,808
Name the first novel and the last novel

611
00:29:05,842 --> 00:29:10,679
By the mid-century american
novelist thomas wolfe,

612
00:29:10,714 --> 00:29:13,382
Both of which deal with the american theme

613
00:29:13,416 --> 00:29:16,552
Of the wanderer.

614
00:29:16,586 --> 00:29:19,722
- I
-I know this.

615
00:29:19,756 --> 00:29:21,724
- You do?
- Okay.

616
00:29:21,758 --> 00:29:24,894
Anyone want to take this?

617
00:29:27,631 --> 00:29:30,966
Here we go.

618
00:29:31,001 --> 00:29:34,103
- hey...
- Shh.

619
00:29:34,137 --> 00:29:36,972
The first and last novel

620
00:29:37,007 --> 00:29:39,675
By mid-century american
novelist thomas wolfe,

621
00:29:39,709 --> 00:29:45,447
Both which deal with the
american theme of...

622
00:29:45,482 --> 00:29:49,551
Wanderer...

623
00:29:49,586 --> 00:29:51,387
the first is

624
00:29:51,421 --> 00:29:54,223
<i>Look homeward, angel...</i>

625
00:29:54,257 --> 00:29:56,425
And the second is

626
00:29:56,459 --> 00:29:59,662
<i>You can't go home again.</i>

627
00:30:04,034 --> 00:30:05,768
That is correct.

628
00:30:05,802 --> 00:30:10,072
East dillon takes the lead.

629
00:30:10,106 --> 00:30:12,741
And now for remington high.

630
00:30:12,776 --> 00:30:14,810
hey...Take a break.

631
00:30:14,844 --> 00:30:16,912
We got you covered.

632
00:30:16,947 --> 00:30:19,815
<i>-...Who wrote the books galapagos...</i>

633
00:30:22,852 --> 00:30:25,254
* *

634
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:29,792
Come here, sweetie.

635
00:30:29,826 --> 00:30:31,627
Come here.

636
00:30:36,366 --> 00:30:40,035
He called his grandmother...

637
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:42,738
And his mom.

638
00:30:45,241 --> 00:30:47,509
I thought he was the one.

639
00:30:47,544 --> 00:30:50,112
I know.

640
00:30:50,146 --> 00:30:53,515
He can't even call after three years?

641
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:56,819
I don't know what to do.

642
00:30:56,853 --> 00:30:59,388
I'm so tired of feeling like this.

643
00:30:59,422 --> 00:31:00,789
I know.

644
00:31:00,824 --> 00:31:03,292
And you're gonna survive,

645
00:31:03,326 --> 00:31:06,795
And good things are gonna
start to happen again.

646
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,764
And one day, you may even look back,

647
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:12,901
And even this will not be such a bad thing.

648
00:31:26,282 --> 00:31:28,350
Who the hell's that?

649
00:31:28,385 --> 00:31:30,819
Hey! I thought you were
bringing the whole team.

650
00:31:30,854 --> 00:31:32,988
They all had some party to go to.

651
00:31:33,023 --> 00:31:34,423
- - who is he?

652
00:31:34,457 --> 00:31:35,724
That's tinker. He's on my team.

653
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:37,526
He came to help out.

654
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,895
Hey, thanks for coming, tink.

655
00:31:39,929 --> 00:31:43,032
Hello, tyra.

656
00:31:43,066 --> 00:31:46,135
This is landry clarke calling.

657
00:31:46,169 --> 00:31:50,839
I am here at the designated rest stop

658
00:31:50,874 --> 00:31:54,076
That we agreed upon.

659
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:57,212
It's kind of obvious that you are, uh...

660
00:31:57,247 --> 00:31:59,515
Not gonna show up, which is fine.

661
00:31:59,549 --> 00:32:03,018
I just kind of wanted to,
you know, see you face-to-face

662
00:32:03,053 --> 00:32:05,721
And kind of find out what the deal is,

663
00:32:05,755 --> 00:32:07,790
If I'm supposed to be waiting on you or not.

664
00:32:07,824 --> 00:32:09,458
Because if I'm supposed to
be waiting on you, tyra,

665
00:32:09,492 --> 00:32:10,993
I will wait.

666
00:32:11,027 --> 00:32:12,394
I will...

667
00:32:12,429 --> 00:32:14,863
Wait like one of those

668
00:32:14,898 --> 00:32:17,466
British foot guards outside
of buckingham palace.

669
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,035
I will keep my eyes straight ahead.

670
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:22,304
I won't look to the left or to the right.

671
00:32:22,338 --> 00:32:24,473
Uh...

672
00:32:28,011 --> 00:32:32,114
I kind of have a feeling
that you're probably...

673
00:32:32,148 --> 00:32:35,217
Looking to the left or the right

674
00:32:35,251 --> 00:32:38,353
Or both...

675
00:32:38,388 --> 00:32:41,457
Which is fine.

676
00:32:41,491 --> 00:32:44,927
I guess I kind of...

677
00:32:44,961 --> 00:32:48,630
Just answered my own question.

678
00:32:48,665 --> 00:32:52,067
I guess I will...

679
00:32:52,102 --> 00:32:55,037
See you around, then.

680
00:33:06,149 --> 00:33:12,888
* *

681
00:33:12,922 --> 00:33:15,491
Everybody, thank you
very much for coming out.

682
00:33:15,525 --> 00:33:17,793
Remember that every raffle
ticket that you buy,

683
00:33:17,827 --> 00:33:19,995
Every dollar that you
stick between the thighs

684
00:33:20,029 --> 00:33:22,798
Of one of these luscious,
luscious, beautiful women

685
00:33:22,832 --> 00:33:24,833
Goes to help me, goes to help you,

686
00:33:24,868 --> 00:33:27,836
Goes to help my family and
my future kid, all right?

687
00:33:27,871 --> 00:33:30,172
Thank you for coming out.

688
00:33:30,206 --> 00:33:32,207
I can't--I can't open it.
You got to help me.

689
00:33:32,242 --> 00:33:35,744
Everybody rip it!

690
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,081
Oh, my god.

691
00:33:39,115 --> 00:33:40,582
Aw!

692
00:33:40,617 --> 00:33:48,023
* *

693
00:33:48,057 --> 00:33:49,525
Come here. Let me holler at you.

694
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:50,993
- Uh
-huh.

695
00:33:51,027 --> 00:33:53,095
It's a nice place you got right here.

696
00:33:53,129 --> 00:33:55,063
Well, thank you.

697
00:33:55,098 --> 00:33:57,099
Ready to make some real money?

698
00:33:57,133 --> 00:34:00,435
Yeah, I... I need to make some money.

699
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:02,037
I got a business opportunity

700
00:34:02,071 --> 00:34:04,339
That can really make you
a rich man, all right?

701
00:34:04,374 --> 00:34:06,542
What kind of business opportunity

702
00:34:06,576 --> 00:34:07,843
You talking about?

703
00:34:07,877 --> 00:34:10,045
I can't talk about that right now, man.

704
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,414
- Okay.
- But, uh...

705
00:34:12,448 --> 00:34:14,383
Let me holler at my man.
I'll get back to you.

706
00:34:14,417 --> 00:34:15,918
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

707
00:34:15,952 --> 00:34:18,020
Hey, congratulations on the kid, man.

708
00:34:18,054 --> 00:34:19,154
Thanks.

709
00:34:19,189 --> 00:34:22,024
Yeah.

710
00:34:26,396 --> 00:34:28,764
That is pretty good. Can I see 100?

711
00:34:28,798 --> 00:34:30,933
Hey, tim riggins.

712
00:34:30,967 --> 00:34:33,001
What are you doing here?

713
00:34:33,036 --> 00:34:34,670
Surprised to see me?

714
00:34:34,704 --> 00:34:36,538
Yes, I am surprised to see you.

715
00:34:36,573 --> 00:34:38,440
What are you doing here? - Mom's at work.

716
00:34:38,474 --> 00:34:40,509
Dad's at a bar.

717
00:34:40,543 --> 00:34:42,511
Mom gave the dog back.

718
00:34:42,545 --> 00:34:44,112
Right.

719
00:34:44,147 --> 00:34:47,449
You know, she always has
to have everything her way.

720
00:34:47,483 --> 00:34:50,619
Can't wait till my dad comes back.

721
00:34:50,653 --> 00:34:52,387
* *

722
00:34:52,422 --> 00:34:55,157
Come on, let's dance.

723
00:35:00,063 --> 00:35:01,763
Becks, come here for a second.

724
00:35:01,798 --> 00:35:05,067
Come here, listen to me for one second.

725
00:35:05,101 --> 00:35:08,270
Your dad's not coming back.

726
00:35:08,304 --> 00:35:10,339
How would you know what
my dad is or isn't doing?

727
00:35:10,373 --> 00:35:11,940
I know he's not coming back,

728
00:35:11,975 --> 00:35:13,642
Because I heard him on the phone.

729
00:35:13,676 --> 00:35:15,944
He's got a kid. He lives in seattle.

730
00:35:15,979 --> 00:35:18,146
He's got a whole family there.

731
00:35:18,181 --> 00:35:20,816
That's why he bought you a dog.

732
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:22,451
Listen to me.

733
00:35:22,485 --> 00:35:23,752
This is what they do--

734
00:35:23,786 --> 00:35:26,255
Your dad, my dad.

735
00:35:26,289 --> 00:35:27,856
They leave, and they don't come back.

736
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:31,426
They--they buy you these things
so it's not uncomfortable

737
00:35:31,461 --> 00:35:33,762
For the five minutes a
year they're in your face.

738
00:35:33,796 --> 00:35:36,298
You start to blame yourself,
the people around you,

739
00:35:36,332 --> 00:35:37,766
Because they've tried, and you pushed--

740
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,967
No, listen...

741
00:35:39,002 --> 00:35:41,336
could you not do it here, please?

742
00:35:41,371 --> 00:35:42,771
I want you to know it's not...

743
00:35:42,805 --> 00:35:44,172
Can we just talk about this at home?

744
00:35:44,207 --> 00:35:47,376
Can we just talk about this at home?

745
00:35:54,651 --> 00:35:57,519
Tink, where'd you learn
how to build like this?

746
00:35:57,553 --> 00:35:59,454
My granddad worked in construction.

747
00:35:59,489 --> 00:36:03,325
Well, you know what you're doing.

748
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:05,694
Yes, sir.

749
00:36:05,728 --> 00:36:07,729
Hey. Thank you.

750
00:36:07,764 --> 00:36:11,133
No big deal. Luke's a good guy.

751
00:36:11,167 --> 00:36:12,801
He's one of those players

752
00:36:12,835 --> 00:36:14,303
That's holding this team together.

753
00:36:14,337 --> 00:36:17,205
He's pretty much a star.
Never acts like it, though.

754
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,675
You know, I figure you know that.

755
00:36:19,709 --> 00:36:21,343
Anyways, I figure if I'm helping out luke,

756
00:36:21,377 --> 00:36:24,212
I'm helping out the team.

757
00:36:24,247 --> 00:36:27,749
Yeah. You're a good man.

758
00:36:34,791 --> 00:36:35,957
I told you not to tell her!

759
00:36:35,992 --> 00:36:38,193
- What?
- I said I was gonna tell her.

760
00:36:38,227 --> 00:36:40,462
I told you not to tell her.
What the hell did you do?

761
00:36:40,496 --> 00:36:42,164
Look, you and I both know
you weren't gonna say a thing.

762
00:36:42,198 --> 00:36:43,765
You think you're hot stuff,
don't you, kid, huh?

763
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,601
I find out you touched my daughter,
I'm gonna kick your--

764
00:36:46,636 --> 00:36:49,137
Funny thing is, you don't
give a damn about your daughter.

765
00:36:49,172 --> 00:36:53,442
You know what else is funny?
I had sex with your wife.

766
00:37:23,873 --> 00:37:25,340
Hi.

767
00:37:25,375 --> 00:37:27,409
I know it's late. I'm sorry.

768
00:37:27,443 --> 00:37:28,677
But is coach home?

769
00:37:28,711 --> 00:37:30,746
Yeah. One sec.

770
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:31,780
Hon?

771
00:37:34,384 --> 00:37:35,484
- Hey.
- Hey.

772
00:37:35,518 --> 00:37:37,185
What you doing here? You all right?

773
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,855
Yeah. I'm getting there.

774
00:37:43,826 --> 00:37:45,560
There you go.

775
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:48,997
All right.

776
00:37:49,031 --> 00:37:51,533
Sorry for coming by so late.
It's all right.

777
00:38:21,631 --> 00:38:24,666
that kid trusts me.

778
00:38:27,837 --> 00:38:29,671
What do we do with it?

779
00:38:31,808 --> 00:38:34,776
It's gonna disappear.

780
00:38:38,181 --> 00:38:41,249
It's been a strange week.

781
00:39:13,483 --> 00:39:15,750
Hey. How you doing?

782
00:39:16,585 --> 00:39:20,388
Um, I'm here to get a dog about way big.

783
00:39:20,422 --> 00:39:23,124
A disgruntled redhead
dropped him off yesterday.

784
00:39:23,158 --> 00:39:26,060
And you're not gonna
bring him back tomorrow?

785
00:39:26,094 --> 00:39:27,328
No.

786
00:39:27,362 --> 00:39:29,630
Because people aren't
always very responsible

787
00:39:29,665 --> 00:39:31,098
About these dogs.

788
00:39:31,133 --> 00:39:34,902
Are you gonna be a responsible person?

789
00:39:34,936 --> 00:39:37,305
Yes, ma'am.

790
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,574
After this pen, you want to call it a day?

791
00:39:40,609 --> 00:39:41,876
If we don't finish up now,

792
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:44,445
We're just gonna have
to do it again tomorrow.

793
00:39:44,479 --> 00:39:46,047
All right, then. Round them up.

794
00:39:46,081 --> 00:39:48,282
Nobody says that anymore.

795
00:39:48,317 --> 00:39:51,519
Just did.

796
00:39:51,553 --> 00:39:53,020
ho!

797
00:39:53,055 --> 00:39:54,455
Get up, get up!

798
00:39:54,489 --> 00:39:57,758
Ahc

799
00:39:57,793 --> 00:40:00,461
Ah! Dad!

800
00:40:00,495 --> 00:40:02,196
Ah!

801
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:05,299
Get out of there, luke. Get out!

802
00:40:05,334 --> 00:40:07,134
You all right?

803
00:40:07,169 --> 00:40:09,937
- Where'd he get you?
- Uhh...Ah...

804
00:40:09,971 --> 00:40:11,706
- Son, you all right?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

805
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,808
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

806
00:40:13,842 --> 00:40:15,509
Ah!

807
00:40:20,582 --> 00:40:24,118
Hey, jess.

808
00:40:26,555 --> 00:40:28,189
I actually-- I was looking for you,

809
00:40:28,223 --> 00:40:29,790
'cause I wanted to ask you something.

810
00:40:29,825 --> 00:40:31,625
Plus, I was hungry,

811
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:34,362
And you make an unbelievable
pulled-pork sandwich,

812
00:40:34,396 --> 00:40:37,331
So...

813
00:40:37,366 --> 00:40:39,433
Will you go out with me?

814
00:40:39,468 --> 00:40:43,671
Things between me and tyra are 100% over.

815
00:40:43,705 --> 00:40:46,273
My life is no longer complicated,

816
00:40:46,308 --> 00:40:48,442
And I really would like to go out with you.

817
00:40:48,477 --> 00:40:52,380
I'm really happy for you. Congratulations.

818
00:40:52,414 --> 00:40:54,682
Just--just one date.

819
00:40:54,716 --> 00:40:56,884
why would I do that?

820
00:40:56,918 --> 00:41:00,154
I don't--I'm-- I have a car.

821
00:41:00,188 --> 00:41:01,155
Play guitar.

822
00:41:01,189 --> 00:41:03,057
I might write you a song someday.

823
00:41:03,091 --> 00:41:05,126
Then you'd be the girl in the so-
-I don't know.

824
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,361
Would you please go on a date with me?

825
00:41:07,396 --> 00:41:09,864
So, yes?

826
00:41:11,433 --> 00:41:13,367
All right, you tell me
what your name's gonna be,

827
00:41:13,402 --> 00:41:14,869
All right?

828
00:41:14,903 --> 00:41:16,704
'cause julien it's not. Yeah, I know.

829
00:41:16,738 --> 00:41:18,205
It is boring, isn't it?

830
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,708
How about skeeter?

831
00:41:20,742 --> 00:41:22,376
Oh, look at that.

832
00:41:22,411 --> 00:41:25,679
Yeah, skeeter it is. Yes.

833
00:41:25,714 --> 00:41:29,350
It's skeeter. Your new name is skeet man.

834
00:41:29,384 --> 00:41:30,818
You're the skeeter.

835
00:41:30,852 --> 00:41:33,354
You're still whining, and I don't know why.

836
00:41:33,388 --> 00:41:35,556
Whatever you do, don't go in here, okay?

837
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:38,826
That's lesson-- lesson number one.

838
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:40,327
- - here. Here, no.

839
00:41:40,362 --> 00:41:43,497
Here, don't go in here.
We're gonna pull in right now.

840
00:41:43,532 --> 00:41:44,732
Here we go.

841
00:41:44,766 --> 00:41:48,602
Just please don't go in my truck.

842
00:41:48,637 --> 00:41:50,471
- - I'm gonna let you go.

843
00:41:53,942 --> 00:41:55,643
Okay. Do your thing.

844
00:41:55,677 --> 00:41:58,345
Do your thing, skeeter.

845
00:42:12,227 --> 00:42:15,596
It's pretty great.
