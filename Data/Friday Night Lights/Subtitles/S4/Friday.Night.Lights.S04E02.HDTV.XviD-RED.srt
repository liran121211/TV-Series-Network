1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:04,253
<i>The fields are brown,
this town has been divided.</i>

2
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:07,423
We need to acknowledge the huge part
you played in this redistricting effort.

3
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:11,010
We just brought this kid in.

4
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:13,429
Next stop is juvie for him,
and that's a bad path.

5
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:15,973
- If I need you to be here at 6 a.m.?
- I'll be here.

6
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:19,277
- How is it to have been Tim Riggins?
- I'm still Tim Riggins.

7
00:00:19,402 --> 00:00:21,687
Yeah, but you know
what I mean, though.

8
00:00:22,049 --> 00:00:24,815
You're all the center of universe
in Texas one year, and the next...

9
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:26,442
Boom, fall off a cliff.

10
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,074
<i>This is as bad as anything
I've ever seen on a football field.</i>

11
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:32,365
Game is over.
Dillon has forfeited.

12
00:00:50,241 --> 00:00:51,340
Wake up.

13
00:00:52,836 --> 00:00:55,846
Come on, get up. You can't be here,
this is private property.

14
00:00:56,593 --> 00:00:59,058
Aren't you...
Aren't you Tim Riggins?

15
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:00,226
Yes, sir.

16
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:05,231
You need to get yourself together
and get outta here. You can't be here.

17
00:01:36,584 --> 00:01:37,642
Hey, Coach.

18
00:01:38,213 --> 00:01:39,056
Hey, dad.

19
00:01:39,964 --> 00:01:41,559
Morning.
Morning, Gracie Belle.

20
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,607
- We made coffee.
- Did you bring the paper in yet?

21
00:01:49,486 --> 00:01:50,943
- I'll go get it.
- I'll get it.

22
00:01:51,068 --> 00:01:52,987
I'll get the paper...
I'll get my own paper.

23
00:01:56,402 --> 00:01:58,039
Thank you for the coffee.

24
00:01:58,937 --> 00:02:00,202
You're welcome.

25
00:02:10,746 --> 00:02:11,547
Morning.

26
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:14,671
Hey, hon.

27
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:18,986
Babe, just go on. Come on now,
just let me just do this.

28
00:02:31,969 --> 00:02:33,613
That's a hell of a combo.

29
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:36,238
Boy, I can smell State.

30
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,365
State! State! State!

31
00:02:55,087 --> 00:02:56,759
They know
they're supposed to be here.

32
00:02:57,228 --> 00:02:58,279
I know.

33
00:02:58,587 --> 00:03:00,924
I've looked everywhere.
I went to the training room,

34
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:02,699
I went to the bus stop...

35
00:03:02,846 --> 00:03:04,141
Nobody's here, Coach.

36
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,887
Nowhere in the building.

37
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:22,686
Hey friend!

38
00:03:23,524 --> 00:03:25,274
Come on, come go with me.

39
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:27,957
I'm not in the mood.
I don't have time right now.

40
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,792
I got to show you something, Eric.

41
00:03:30,213 --> 00:03:31,255
Please.

42
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,800
Come here.

43
00:03:33,084 --> 00:03:34,088
Please.

44
00:03:39,913 --> 00:03:41,554
Do you know what you're looking at?

45
00:03:43,006 --> 00:03:44,515
No, why don't you fill me in?

46
00:03:44,944 --> 00:03:47,393
This is the address
for Luke Cafferty.

47
00:03:48,047 --> 00:03:50,437
Star Running Back.
Dillon Panthers.

48
00:03:50,671 --> 00:03:52,606
Future Super Star, Luke.

49
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,191
This is the address they have.

50
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,527
Where does he really live?

51
00:03:57,035 --> 00:03:58,261
East Dillon...

52
00:03:59,876 --> 00:04:01,676
He's supposed to be yours.

53
00:04:09,522 --> 00:04:12,626
Friday Night Lights 4x02
- After The Fall -

54
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:17,923
Subtitles: Team Lions
With the participation of:

55
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,468
Benj!, Collioure, DarKsh,
GillesSilb, Jenn, Ju, Nam, Tactactac

56
00:04:58,458 --> 00:04:59,715
Here she is!

57
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:02,843
They were thinking that we were not
gonna notice that it's an empty field

58
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,700
out there?
Do they think we're stupid?

59
00:05:04,825 --> 00:05:07,598
We wouldn't have known
unless Buddy told us. Come on, Julie!

60
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,765
That's another thing,
don't say anything about that

61
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:12,436
because he's afraid half the town
will boycott his dealership.

62
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:15,115
Well, I don't blame him.
I'm a little worried myself.

63
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,280
- Julie, let's go!
- They considered kind of a...

64
00:05:17,405 --> 00:05:19,735
- Mrs Coach kind of a mood.
- You don't have to worry.

65
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,438
You didn't do anything wrong.

66
00:05:21,563 --> 00:05:24,949
I know but these people are all about
doing the wrong thing. They don't care.

67
00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:27,826
And I feel just terrible
for poor Luke Cafferty.

68
00:05:27,951 --> 00:05:30,788
That poor boy...
I'm gonna have to tell him about this.

69
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:34,169
I feel so sorry for him, that he has
to come to my school and be on my team.

70
00:05:34,294 --> 00:05:36,054
- That's awful.
- Honey, come on now.

71
00:05:36,179 --> 00:05:37,795
- Let's go.
- Ready to go, dad?

72
00:05:38,057 --> 00:05:41,186
- Yes, I'm very ready.
- Are you ready for your big first day?

73
00:05:41,766 --> 00:05:43,970
It should be fun.
New teachers,

74
00:05:44,095 --> 00:05:46,456
news friends, new school...

75
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:54,144
- Let's go to school half naked.
- Be careful.

76
00:05:55,008 --> 00:05:57,731
It's a high school, mom.
Not a prison yard.

77
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,511
- Bye, I love you.
- I love you too.

78
00:06:01,636 --> 00:06:02,861
Bye, honey.

79
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,162
- What's up?
- You know who did this?

80
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:02,380
- Do what?
- Put flags on my locker.

81
00:07:02,662 --> 00:07:05,200
I ain't see no one,
I'll tell ya if I'd seen him.

82
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,135
Come on, man.
You know me better than that.

83
00:07:22,097 --> 00:07:25,819
I took the liberty of putting up
in a internship,

84
00:07:26,323 --> 00:07:29,446
with a local artist out here.
His name is Richard Sherman.

85
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:31,470
He selected you.

86
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:33,033
He did?

87
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:36,428
It's quite a honor,
the guy is a genious.

88
00:07:36,918 --> 00:07:38,665
Can you go this afternoon?

89
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:42,173
Yeah, of course.

90
00:07:42,298 --> 00:07:44,678
But why did you put me up
for internship?

91
00:07:44,803 --> 00:07:47,091
Because you have
whatever important artist needs.

92
00:07:48,581 --> 00:07:50,135
- What's that?
- Pluck.

93
00:07:53,054 --> 00:07:54,454
- Thanks.
- Sure.

94
00:08:04,731 --> 00:08:05,859
Excuse me.

95
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,057
Excuse me, I just need to...
If I squeezed by you here...

96
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,212
It's a open...

97
00:08:28,232 --> 00:08:30,050
Oh my God, are you okay?

98
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:31,941
What the hell, uh?

99
00:08:32,951 --> 00:08:35,141
Look what you did to my bike,
you freaking idiot.

100
00:08:35,266 --> 00:08:39,245
I mean, honestly, you're not even
wearing a helmet or something...

101
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,769
Come on, are you serious?

102
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:44,022
You know what, junior? I think I might
need to explain something to you.

103
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,233
- I'm listening.
- It took me a lot of months

104
00:08:46,865 --> 00:08:48,915
to save up for that bike, okay?

105
00:08:50,428 --> 00:08:52,128
So it means a lot to me.

106
00:08:52,413 --> 00:08:55,617
Because not everybody gets a car
bought from their dad.

107
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,996
So you're gonna pay me damages.

108
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:00,974
- That's right.
- For my bike.

109
00:09:02,058 --> 00:09:03,792
- What's your name?
- Landry Clarke.

110
00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:07,376
- What's your name?
- Jess Merriweather.

111
00:09:07,567 --> 00:09:08,910
Nice to meet you.

112
00:09:09,141 --> 00:09:12,843
M-E-R-R-I-W-E-A-T-H-E-R.

113
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,929
That's how you spell my last name. Don't
forget that when you make up the check.

114
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:56,762
What the hell
is so important out here?

115
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,362
Nothing, I'm sorry...

116
00:09:58,487 --> 00:10:00,766
I think I've a wrong adress.
I just can't find this artist...

117
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,160
Who?

118
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:04,790
Richard Sherman,
I'm gonna take off.

119
00:10:04,915 --> 00:10:07,421
- I'm sorry I bothered you.
- I'm Richard Sherman, dumbass.

120
00:10:07,703 --> 00:10:10,192
I'm Matt Saracen,
I'm your new intern.

121
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,070
I got a bunch of crap in here,
I need you to start moving it.

122
00:10:13,339 --> 00:10:16,950
Come on in, there's shards on the front,
I don't want any crap about it.

123
00:10:17,508 --> 00:10:20,231
- You got shoes on?
- Yes, I wear shoes.

124
00:10:20,356 --> 00:10:21,606
Close the door.

125
00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:29,049
There's the coach.

126
00:10:31,441 --> 00:10:32,965
I'm gonna go ahead and take off.

127
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:34,919
I'll see you all later.

128
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:39,971
Can I talk to you for a minute?

129
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:43,308
I don't know what's going on with
my football players, I need your help.

130
00:10:43,756 --> 00:10:46,056
Why did you forfeit the game, Coach?

131
00:10:48,033 --> 00:10:49,033
I'm sorry?

132
00:10:49,456 --> 00:10:52,711
- I said why'd you forfeit the game?
- I heard your question.

133
00:10:54,909 --> 00:10:57,439
You have an answer to that
cause I don't understand.

134
00:10:57,564 --> 00:11:00,909
Let me tell you something. I don't have
to explain my decisions to you, Landry.

135
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,828
I can explain to you
that everyone gave

136
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,397
everything they had out there
and you just quit on us?

137
00:11:05,522 --> 00:11:07,863
Do you know what it feels like?
It's not a good feeling.

138
00:11:07,988 --> 00:11:10,438
So I'm done
and everyone else is done.

139
00:11:20,371 --> 00:11:21,710
Give me some piece!

140
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,390
Gimme something to work with!

141
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,430
There you go, babe!

142
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:35,945
Come here, son.

143
00:11:38,216 --> 00:11:39,615
Hey, Principal Taylor.

144
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:42,034
- Did you see that?
- I... that was amazing.

145
00:11:42,586 --> 00:11:44,554
- That was amazing.
- Thank you.

146
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:47,049
- I need to talk to you.
- Yes, ma'am.

147
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,733
I need you to tell me
where you live.

148
00:11:50,531 --> 00:11:51,877
2268 Oakdale Rd.

149
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:55,380
- Is that where you live?
- Yes.

150
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,934
2268 Oakdale Rd.

151
00:11:57,648 --> 00:12:01,053
You know that's an empty field
with a mailbox in front of it, right?

152
00:12:01,909 --> 00:12:03,909
You live on Kilroy, don't you?

153
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,558
And you know that Kilroy is zoned
for East Dillon High,

154
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:07,994
isn't that right?

155
00:12:11,113 --> 00:12:14,130
I've worked so hard for the Panthers
and this team means everything to me.

156
00:12:14,255 --> 00:12:16,109
I mean,
there's no team at East Dillon.

157
00:12:16,371 --> 00:12:18,654
There is a team actually.
They're starting one.

158
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:19,910
Well, I mean...

159
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:22,647
Is there anything that we can do?
Can you write...

160
00:12:22,772 --> 00:12:24,724
a letter to the Governor or somehow?

161
00:12:24,989 --> 00:12:28,539
I tell you what. The only thing,
the only thing you could do

162
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,329
is your parents could move.
That's the only thing.

163
00:12:31,454 --> 00:12:34,204
- That's not gonna happen.
- I'm sorry, son.

164
00:12:35,518 --> 00:12:37,632
Go over there, you have
to pack up your stuff.

165
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,326
Starting tomorrow you're going
at East Dillon High.

166
00:12:40,451 --> 00:12:41,451
What?

167
00:12:41,743 --> 00:12:42,743
That's it?

168
00:12:43,049 --> 00:12:44,049
That's it.

169
00:12:45,945 --> 00:12:46,945
I mean...

170
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,019
I will get an A
in every single class.

171
00:12:52,144 --> 00:12:54,808
- I know, you're a good student.
- Every one. I promise you that.

172
00:12:55,755 --> 00:12:56,755
I will...

173
00:12:57,012 --> 00:12:59,695
I will do anything, I swear to you,
I will do anything...

174
00:13:00,892 --> 00:13:02,364
I'm... begging you.

175
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,216
Sorry, son.

176
00:13:04,341 --> 00:13:06,827
I hate that it has
to be this way, too.

177
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,490
No, I'm okay, I'm okay...
Thank you.

178
00:13:10,615 --> 00:13:13,755
- You gonna be alright?
- I'm fine. Thank you very much.

179
00:13:13,945 --> 00:13:15,077
Go on, now.

180
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,569
Principal Taylor! Hey!

181
00:13:23,326 --> 00:13:26,096
I'm real sorry for lying to you.
For the whole time

182
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:29,558
and for lying to you right now
to your face. I'm real sorry, okay?

183
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:32,352
I appreciate that, Luke.
I do appreciate that.

184
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,065
- It'll be alright, son.
- No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

185
00:13:35,701 --> 00:13:36,701
Thank you.

186
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:40,725
I'll be right there, coach!

187
00:13:46,056 --> 00:13:49,017
Why hasn't the part
for Mrs. Carlson's Taurus come in yet?

188
00:13:49,142 --> 00:13:50,279
I don't know.

189
00:13:50,404 --> 00:13:53,415
The part was ordered ten days ago.
Did you order from Tahiti?

190
00:13:53,668 --> 00:13:55,353
Finish this transmission, man.

191
00:13:55,478 --> 00:13:58,170
Finish it today. You were
working on it all day yesterday.

192
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:02,924
Just throwing it out there...
It's been well over two weeks,

193
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:06,052
- you think I'll get paid or?
- I'm waiting on money to come in.

194
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,137
When?

195
00:14:07,428 --> 00:14:09,843
Seriously, could you back off
for two seconds?

196
00:14:09,968 --> 00:14:12,225
Do you have any clue
what I've got on my plate right now?

197
00:14:12,755 --> 00:14:13,945
Seriously, man.

198
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:16,562
I'm trying to run a garage,
I gotta a pregnant wife,

199
00:14:16,687 --> 00:14:20,479
and I haven't slept for two weeks
because Mindy's reading some stupid book

200
00:14:20,604 --> 00:14:23,369
about what's supposed to happen
every 2 seconds of your pregnant life

201
00:14:23,494 --> 00:14:26,582
and now every time she farts,
she's thinking her water's breaking.

202
00:14:26,707 --> 00:14:30,243
Or, or that's she's going
into contractions. So back off!

203
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,249
Billy, could you pass me
that violin please?

204
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,542
Would you shut up?!

205
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,294
- You're hogging it!
- Shut up!

206
00:14:42,095 --> 00:14:44,845
No, that wasn't
directed towards you, ma'am.

207
00:14:46,713 --> 00:14:47,719
Where are you?

208
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,276
We'll send a truck out
as soon as we can.

209
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:54,463
When you're done with it,
I need the violin.

210
00:14:54,588 --> 00:14:56,226
Get your ass up, okay?

211
00:14:56,933 --> 00:14:58,933
Get your ass up, we got a tow.

212
00:15:04,893 --> 00:15:06,364
Principal Taylor.

213
00:15:06,871 --> 00:15:07,921
Hey, y'all.

214
00:15:09,092 --> 00:15:10,492
What's it gonna take?

215
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,006
What conversation we're having here?
What is all about?

216
00:15:13,131 --> 00:15:14,481
I think you know.

217
00:15:15,168 --> 00:15:18,625
- Are we talking about Luke?
- Yeah, we're talking about Luke.

218
00:15:19,035 --> 00:15:20,245
So what's it gonna take?

219
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:23,338
New books for the library,
new instruments for the orchestra, what?

220
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:27,210
Are you all coming to me
in the school parking lot

221
00:15:27,335 --> 00:15:28,777
and offering me a bribe?

222
00:15:28,902 --> 00:15:31,462
You need to be reasonable
about this, Tami.

223
00:15:31,587 --> 00:15:33,348
It's gonna hurt this kid.

224
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:36,184
We can't let that happen to him
or to our team.

225
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,186
- Or to the school.
- Or to you.

226
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:41,219
I mean, what's gonna happen to you
if this goes down?

227
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:43,608
You're gonna get lynched.

228
00:15:43,948 --> 00:15:46,522
That is so sweet.
You are so sweet to think about me.

229
00:15:46,647 --> 00:15:49,069
I appreciate that so much.
I can take care of myself, thank you.

230
00:15:49,194 --> 00:15:52,305
Think of this: that first win'll have
to be forfeited because of this.

231
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:54,460
If that happens
we might not make it back from that.

232
00:15:54,585 --> 00:15:56,871
That means we might not make it
to state this year.

233
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:00,542
- Now do you want that?
- That boy was enrolled here illegally.

234
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,920
Ironically, he just happens
to be going to a school

235
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,172
where your husband
is the football coach.

236
00:16:08,709 --> 00:16:11,148
Would you do me a favor?
Would you go home

237
00:16:11,358 --> 00:16:13,023
and ask your husband one thing.

238
00:16:13,148 --> 00:16:15,599
Ask him who put up that mailbox.

239
00:16:16,987 --> 00:16:19,644
Because the Dillon Panthers
have been using that mailbox

240
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,354
long before I got here.

241
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,440
And if I want to do
a little digging around...

242
00:16:24,804 --> 00:16:26,109
things could come up.

243
00:16:26,859 --> 00:16:30,071
I think games could be forfeited.
I think rings...

244
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,030
could be lost.

245
00:16:51,985 --> 00:16:53,685
You gotta be kidding me.

246
00:16:56,206 --> 00:16:58,856
Hey, Tim Riggins
who used to be a Panther.

247
00:17:00,243 --> 00:17:01,269
Good morning.

248
00:17:01,805 --> 00:17:03,229
Tell me you need a tow.

249
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:07,240
Yeah, no,
but I do need a ride to school.

250
00:17:07,365 --> 00:17:09,792
Which would be awesome
because my mom's not here,

251
00:17:09,917 --> 00:17:12,066
I don't know what she's doing,
she's MIA for some reason

252
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:14,783
and I had to find my dog this morning
cuz little Squirt

253
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:17,790
got out again and I missed the bus
and my hair was doing this weird

254
00:17:17,915 --> 00:17:20,246
flip thing that I wasn't
really too sure about

255
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,457
and it was a really rough morning
altogether so...

256
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,418
Let's get on the road!
Let's get going. I'm gonna be late.

257
00:17:25,868 --> 00:17:27,618
Don't ever do this again.

258
00:17:31,003 --> 00:17:34,010
I mean, all I did all day
was carrying big, rusty, dirty

259
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,054
pieces of metal in a junk yard.
It sucked.

260
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,392
- I still can't believe you were naked.
- No, I wasn't naked. He was naked.

261
00:17:41,623 --> 00:17:44,108
Whatever.
He never even asked me about my art.

262
00:17:44,233 --> 00:17:46,982
Why does he think I'm there?
He thinks I like manual labor?

263
00:17:47,364 --> 00:17:49,359
Maybe he thinks, you know,

264
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:52,067
you're not a great artist
cuz you go to community college

265
00:17:52,554 --> 00:17:54,989
No offense.
I didn't mean it to sound...

266
00:17:55,403 --> 00:17:56,408
It's fine.

267
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:57,867
I'm just saying that...

268
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,863
you need to get him excited.
You need to show him who you are

269
00:18:00,988 --> 00:18:03,957
and your art
and just take the bull by the horns.

270
00:18:04,643 --> 00:18:07,113
You know I have been told
that I have pluck.

271
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,540
Really?

272
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,440
I don't know what that means.

273
00:18:53,348 --> 00:18:55,592
I'm Coach Taylor
from over at the high school.

274
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,483
Are you Vince's mother by chance?

275
00:18:58,676 --> 00:18:59,554
Yeah, why?

276
00:19:01,086 --> 00:19:04,601
Well, I just wanted to...
talk with him, that's all.

277
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:09,604
I just came by to talk him.
He missed practice for few days.

278
00:19:09,729 --> 00:19:11,138
That's his business.

279
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:13,985
There ain't no laws
about missing no practice.

280
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,240
Ma'am...

281
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,808
I'm just trying to help your son.

282
00:19:26,302 --> 00:19:28,160
You got twenty bucks?

283
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:34,210
Please?

284
00:19:47,801 --> 00:19:50,109
Lincoln and Victory.

285
00:19:51,268 --> 00:19:52,718
Almost every night.

286
00:20:00,187 --> 00:20:02,687
Hey, do you know
how to get to Lubbock?

287
00:20:04,941 --> 00:20:07,222
You gotta take 61 up to 23.

288
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:11,868
Dillon East, right?

289
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,650
You're the coach at Dillon East.

290
00:20:14,917 --> 00:20:16,548
You've lost your inner pirate.

291
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:21,235
* have you ever heard
"swing your sword"?

292
00:20:21,807 --> 00:20:24,065
You're supposed
to swing your sword like this.

293
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,307
You're swinging yours like this.

294
00:20:27,281 --> 00:20:29,352
I mean, you gotta find
your inner pirate.

295
00:20:29,981 --> 00:20:32,931
A lot of times,
things just happen for a reason.

296
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,493
We don't know
why God wants it that way,

297
00:20:35,618 --> 00:20:39,622
but you can't make the best out of it
until you get back your inner pirate.

298
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:44,420
You might be the luckiest man alive
and not even know it.

299
00:21:10,738 --> 00:21:11,738
Hey, babe.

300
00:21:15,028 --> 00:21:16,429
- Smells good.
- Babe?

301
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,280
What?

302
00:21:20,828 --> 00:21:23,244
Did you know that that mailbox

303
00:21:23,369 --> 00:21:25,547
was out there by that empty field?

304
00:21:25,672 --> 00:21:27,072
Did you know that?

305
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:33,413
- What are you talking about?
- Joe McCoy told me today

306
00:21:33,538 --> 00:21:36,711
that that mailbox has been out there
since you were in the Panthers.

307
00:21:38,629 --> 00:21:39,631
Did you know?

308
00:21:42,328 --> 00:21:43,176
Listen.

309
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:44,621
I don't follow...

310
00:21:44,898 --> 00:21:48,306
what the boosters and parents do.
That's not my job.

311
00:21:48,812 --> 00:21:52,477
There's a lot of different ways
that people try to get kids on the team.

312
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:54,887
What does that mean?

313
00:21:55,012 --> 00:21:57,214
That means you sure were paying
a lot of attention

314
00:21:57,339 --> 00:22:00,735
the last 2 days when you were trying
to get Luke Cafferty on your team.

315
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:03,863
And you know, now I'm in
a really bad position because Joe McCoy

316
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,800
is about to go out and do
all kinds of research and digging

317
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:09,202
into things like State Titles...

318
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,805
Don't talk to me like that.

319
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,580
I'm talking about your State Title.

320
00:22:13,449 --> 00:22:15,499
And not just you but your team.

321
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:19,011
Well, you know what, honey?
I may not even have a team.

322
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:21,285
- Of course you have.
- No, I might not.

323
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:24,258
I'm surprised your friend Joe
didn't inform you that my team

324
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,552
hasn't been showing up for practice
since the forfeit.

325
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:31,391
- I didn't know. Sorry to hear that.
- I'm glad you're sorry. I'm, too.

326
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:34,482
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I tried to get Landry to get together

327
00:22:34,607 --> 00:22:36,624
bring the team out there
and you know what he did?

328
00:22:36,749 --> 00:22:39,983
In the middle of the cafeteria,
he looks at me and basically says,

329
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:41,442
"Hey, Coach, go to Hell."

330
00:22:42,431 --> 00:22:44,028
Babe, I'm sorry to hear that,

331
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,365
but you still...

332
00:22:46,106 --> 00:22:48,199
- shouldn't have lied to me.
- I didn't.

333
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:52,203
I wish you had told me...
You should have told me you knew that.

334
00:22:52,451 --> 00:22:53,451
Knew what?

335
00:22:53,582 --> 00:22:56,624
I don't know who put the mailbox!
You saying I put the mailbox there?

336
00:22:56,792 --> 00:23:00,128
- Anyone else say I did? Cuz I didn't!
- Don't raise your voice.

337
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:04,298
I'm not raising my voice! I don't want
to come home and be accused!

338
00:23:05,296 --> 00:23:08,054
- Then don't lie to me next time!
- I didn't lie to you!

339
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:10,054
- Where are you going?
- Get some milk.

340
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:34,300
What the hell, man?

341
00:23:34,881 --> 00:23:36,414
Say, V. Vince!

342
00:23:37,913 --> 00:23:39,584
Hey, you came to the wrong gym.

343
00:23:41,635 --> 00:23:43,129
Vince, let me talk to you.

344
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:45,381
- Can't you see we're hooping?
- Yeah, I can see.

345
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:48,092
I can see, I understand.
He's not in school, is he?

346
00:23:48,511 --> 00:23:50,461
You're making a mistake, man.

347
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:53,681
Officer Shaw keeps calling.

348
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:56,099
I can't keep him away forever, man.

349
00:23:57,528 --> 00:23:59,609
I've been watching
those game tapes, man.

350
00:24:00,016 --> 00:24:03,290
You're running the 40 in under 5
a full pass. You got all the moves, man.

351
00:24:03,415 --> 00:24:06,444
You've got a lot of talent,
I'm telling you. Don't throw it away.

352
00:24:06,724 --> 00:24:08,356
You're gonna talk to me?

353
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,406
You gonna throw it away?

354
00:24:10,872 --> 00:24:13,117
You gonna throw that away?
Last chance.

355
00:24:13,711 --> 00:24:15,892
I'm not gonna waste my time anymore.

356
00:24:26,037 --> 00:24:27,653
Your choice, Big Man.

357
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:52,323
There's some Chevy parts
in the back,

358
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,284
I want you to move them here
because I gotta start cutting them.

359
00:24:57,151 --> 00:24:58,151
Yes, sir.

360
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:09,713
Excuse me.

361
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,782
Can you get me the sausage
from out back?

362
00:25:13,907 --> 00:25:16,764
- Alright. You want the spicy kind?
- Yeah, that'll do. Here you go.

363
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:22,228
Maam. Extra BBQ sauce.

364
00:25:23,475 --> 00:25:25,731
There you go.
Enjoy.

365
00:25:27,223 --> 00:25:28,703
There your pickles, ma'am.

366
00:25:38,758 --> 00:25:39,881
I got it...

367
00:25:42,219 --> 00:25:44,579
- You wanted the spicy kind, right?
- Yeah.

368
00:25:47,314 --> 00:25:50,514
- I could... You want me to...
- No, no. You're good.

369
00:25:51,223 --> 00:25:53,021
- There you go.
- What are you doing?

370
00:25:53,146 --> 00:25:54,698
What's your problem?

371
00:25:55,617 --> 00:25:57,583
I don't have a problem.
I was just...

372
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:01,474
She looked busy, I just thought I'd help
her out. We go to school together.

373
00:26:02,547 --> 00:26:03,547
This is...

374
00:26:03,672 --> 00:26:04,520
Landry.

375
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:06,852
My dad...

376
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:09,108
- Landry?
- Yeah.

377
00:26:09,991 --> 00:26:11,068
Here, Landry.

378
00:26:11,601 --> 00:26:13,485
Take that out, man.
Thanks for the help.

379
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:16,042
Yeah. Very nice kitchen, cool.

380
00:26:18,836 --> 00:26:19,785
Landry?

381
00:26:22,562 --> 00:26:24,321
I'll get back... Yeah.

382
00:26:28,144 --> 00:26:29,494
What do you want?

383
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:36,228
Here's what we're gonna do.

384
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:40,169
- Special practice Saturday night.
- Saturday?

385
00:26:40,385 --> 00:26:42,634
If it doesn't work out,
we're gonna start over.

386
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:45,061
What exactly does that mean,
start over?

387
00:26:47,241 --> 00:26:50,195
I don't know, Stan.
I don't know what start over means.

388
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:52,108
Saturday night.

389
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:35,987
Tim, how're you doin'?

390
00:27:36,255 --> 00:27:39,730
I heard you were back.
How come you're not back at college?

391
00:27:40,727 --> 00:27:41,617
I...

392
00:27:42,155 --> 00:27:43,155
You what?

393
00:27:43,385 --> 00:27:46,289
I'm working full-time with my brother,
making some money.

394
00:27:47,261 --> 00:27:49,125
You... look different.

395
00:27:49,757 --> 00:27:52,407
- It's the color.
- Yeah, it's pretty red.

396
00:27:57,938 --> 00:27:59,302
I heard about the forfeit.

397
00:28:00,738 --> 00:28:01,738
And...

398
00:28:02,246 --> 00:28:03,746
it's a shaky start, so...

399
00:28:04,528 --> 00:28:07,560
I mean, I'd love to be a part of it
if I could help in any way.

400
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:13,232
- You're offering your help to me?
- Yes, sir.

401
00:28:16,231 --> 00:28:17,381
Come with me.

402
00:28:18,727 --> 00:28:19,727
Come on.

403
00:28:26,772 --> 00:28:28,414
Do we have the latest injury report

404
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:31,167
for Rural Rock?
Is that middle linebacker of theirs

405
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:34,587
still messed up? Cuz if he is,
boy, it's gonna be party time...

406
00:28:35,096 --> 00:28:37,017
- He's out?
- Left knee...

407
00:28:37,142 --> 00:28:38,674
Yeah?
Excellent, thank you.

408
00:28:39,124 --> 00:28:41,369
And Buddy, are we looking...

409
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:43,888
- to talk to that...
- Sorry.

410
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:46,390
I hate to interrupt.
How are you? Good to see you, Sam.

411
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:50,061
Don't mean to interrupt, I just...
Can I have a quick word with you, Joe?

412
00:28:50,509 --> 00:28:52,497
Talk amongst yourselves.

413
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:57,943
I wanted to make sure that we didn't
have any misunderstanding the other day

414
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:00,227
when we had that conversation
in the parking lot.

415
00:29:00,352 --> 00:29:02,615
You know, with the golf cart
and all of that stuff...

416
00:29:02,783 --> 00:29:04,575
And I just wanted to make sure
I was clear

417
00:29:04,871 --> 00:29:07,597
that my decision
has been made and is made

418
00:29:07,722 --> 00:29:10,122
and that Luke Cafferty
is going to East Dillon High.

419
00:29:13,506 --> 00:29:15,398
Are you clear about what I told you?

420
00:29:15,523 --> 00:29:16,921
Oh, yeah, I think I heard you.

421
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:19,006
You mean about
doing an investigation

422
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:22,718
and retroactively taking away Panther
State titles? That's the thing you said?

423
00:29:23,411 --> 00:29:24,470
Because I just want

424
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:28,059
to make sure that you also checked
with all these gentlemen about that,

425
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:30,097
because as you said...

426
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:33,777
you know, that's gonna mean
rings being taken away

427
00:29:33,902 --> 00:29:36,982
and things like that, and I can betcha
there are a lot of rings in this group.

428
00:29:37,352 --> 00:29:39,119
Family and what not.

429
00:29:39,537 --> 00:29:42,238
So, you do what you have to do.
I know you're going to,

430
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:44,990
but I wanted to make sure I've been
clear with you where I stand on it.

431
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:49,036
So, I'll let you all get back to it.
Thank you so much y'all!

432
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:50,204
Enjoy.

433
00:30:01,878 --> 00:30:03,259
Hey, I cut my hand

434
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:06,384
and I don't have a tetnus shot,
so I'm gonna have to go get one.

435
00:30:07,313 --> 00:30:10,024
- That was brilliant.
- Thank you, that was brilliant.

436
00:30:10,149 --> 00:30:13,602
- Thanks for everything, see you later.
- What the hell is your problem?

437
00:30:14,565 --> 00:30:16,160
I don't know what your deal is.

438
00:30:16,285 --> 00:30:19,734
You're rude, nasty and that's fine,
that's your thing, you're an artist.

439
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:22,339
And I'll carry all your crap,
but I'm here and doing all this

440
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:24,752
is 'cause I wanna
be an artist, alright?

441
00:30:24,877 --> 00:30:27,783
So, the least you could do
is say something about it.

442
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:31,002
- You want me to say something?
- I would like you to say something.

443
00:30:31,127 --> 00:30:33,038
Alright, then I'll say something.

444
00:30:38,365 --> 00:30:39,920
That's very helpful.

445
00:30:43,045 --> 00:30:44,717
Yeah, just wrinkle them up.

446
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:49,263
Are you...

447
00:30:56,036 --> 00:30:58,606
Alright, this part here
doesn't make me wanna puke.

448
00:31:00,996 --> 00:31:02,896
Try to work from this place.

449
00:31:05,843 --> 00:31:06,947
Okay.

450
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,716
You're not my father.

451
00:31:27,212 --> 00:31:28,712
I support my family.

452
00:31:30,602 --> 00:31:32,997
She had no business
taking that from you.

453
00:31:34,635 --> 00:31:36,666
You shouldn't have gave it to her.

454
00:31:41,354 --> 00:31:42,354
Sit down.

455
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:45,100
Sit down...

456
00:31:55,549 --> 00:31:56,549
I'm sorry.

457
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:05,781
Don't quit on me.

458
00:32:08,658 --> 00:32:10,308
Don't quit on yourself.

459
00:32:15,047 --> 00:32:17,297
I'm gonna ask you to do me a favor.

460
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,288
This team is broken all to hell.

461
00:32:24,451 --> 00:32:27,820
I could use somebody to help me
put those pieces back together again.

462
00:32:31,707 --> 00:32:33,757
I don't know where I'm going...

463
00:32:36,097 --> 00:32:37,847
but I'll get another job.

464
00:32:40,106 --> 00:32:42,306
This job doesn't work out for you,

465
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:44,879
we both know where you're going.

466
00:32:49,789 --> 00:32:51,089
Bring 'em to me.

467
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:52,970
Talk to 'em and bring 'em to me.

468
00:32:53,286 --> 00:32:54,645
Talk to 'em for me.

469
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:57,558
Talk to 'em and bring 'em to me
tomorrow night.

470
00:32:58,067 --> 00:33:00,144
Special practice,
ten o'clock, out here...

471
00:33:01,193 --> 00:33:02,509
At the field.

472
00:33:03,117 --> 00:33:04,998
Just us, just the Lions.

473
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:06,567
Hey, talk to 'em.

474
00:33:43,095 --> 00:33:44,156
We are...

475
00:33:44,607 --> 00:33:45,606
Panthers!

476
00:33:46,045 --> 00:33:47,107
We are...

477
00:33:47,669 --> 00:33:48,761
Panthers!

478
00:33:59,024 --> 00:34:01,312
Welcome, Panthers!

479
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:10,838
We have a big game coming up,

480
00:34:11,357 --> 00:34:13,040
with West Cambria.

481
00:34:22,665 --> 00:34:24,114
I will wait.

482
00:34:26,799 --> 00:34:27,815
We want Luke!

483
00:34:28,058 --> 00:34:29,066
We want Luke!

484
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,870
I'm Luke Cafferty.

485
00:34:59,322 --> 00:35:01,390
I'm here for special practice,
Coach Taylor called.

486
00:35:02,447 --> 00:35:03,934
- Nice to see you.
- Welcome

487
00:35:04,103 --> 00:35:06,403
- to East Dillon, son.
- Thank you.

488
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,360
Luke, how are you doing?
Good to see you.

489
00:35:11,669 --> 00:35:13,318
- Stan Traub.
- How are you?

490
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:15,959
- Great admirer.
- Nice to meet you. Thanks.

491
00:35:19,642 --> 00:35:21,034
Where's the team?

492
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:44,302
How are you doing, fellas?

493
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:54,725
- Coach.
- How are you doing, Tinker?

494
00:35:57,802 --> 00:35:59,362
Good evening, gentlemen.

495
00:36:00,498 --> 00:36:01,798
Good to see you.

496
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:04,495
Listen...

497
00:36:06,262 --> 00:36:08,123
Last week, we got our asses beat

498
00:36:08,292 --> 00:36:11,168
doing our best,
there is no shame in that, gentlemen.

499
00:36:11,854 --> 00:36:13,670
But I'll tell you what,
I've got shame.

500
00:36:14,336 --> 00:36:16,715
I've got shame
and I apologize to you.

501
00:36:18,655 --> 00:36:21,637
I apologize
for not giving you the chance

502
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:23,355
to finish your fight.

503
00:36:25,753 --> 00:36:27,863
I wanna finish that fight with you.

504
00:36:28,363 --> 00:36:31,363
And I'm asking you,
right here, right now,

505
00:36:31,488 --> 00:36:33,941
to allow me to help you
finish that fight.

506
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:04,990
See this, gentlemen?

507
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:07,558
This right here, this is the past.

508
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,644
Who wants to finish this fight?

509
00:37:17,231 --> 00:37:19,361
Who'll finish this fight with me?

510
00:37:52,505 --> 00:37:53,605
I will, sir.

511
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:11,321
Glad to have you on board, Tinker.

512
00:38:18,223 --> 00:38:19,523
Let's finish it.

513
00:38:21,005 --> 00:38:22,305
Let's finish it!

514
00:38:24,638 --> 00:38:26,138
Let's do this, boys!

515
00:38:41,242 --> 00:38:42,342
Hey, sailor.

516
00:38:45,892 --> 00:38:48,152
Looks like
you haven't slept in a week.

517
00:38:49,555 --> 00:38:50,805
Feels that way.

518
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:56,708
Kinda looking for a place
if you know any.

519
00:38:57,234 --> 00:38:58,585
It shouldn't be so hard.

520
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:00,671
It is when you don't have
first and last.

521
00:39:06,789 --> 00:39:09,638
I do have this trailer...
in my backyard.

522
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:14,227
I'll charge you a $100 a month.

523
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,725
You can stay there
until you find a place.

524
00:39:19,966 --> 00:39:21,149
It's very sweet.

525
00:39:22,218 --> 00:39:25,361
Don't get me wrong,
that was unbelievable,

526
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:28,782
but I'm not that into you.

527
00:39:29,641 --> 00:39:33,036
More importantly, you're not into me,
so who really needs to go there, right?

528
00:39:33,755 --> 00:39:35,998
I'm not gonna come
banging on your door

529
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:38,861
in the middle of the night,
you know what I mean?

530
00:39:39,125 --> 00:39:40,618
But I could use the cash.

531
00:39:41,371 --> 00:39:42,371
When?

532
00:39:44,478 --> 00:39:45,778
Start right now.

533
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:48,176
- Let me get you the keys.
- Like tonight?

534
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:49,944
Remember where I live?

535
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,508
I'm gonna give my daughter a call.

536
00:39:53,767 --> 00:39:55,600
She's not gonna know you from Adam.

537
00:39:56,604 --> 00:39:58,601
I don't want you to scare her.

538
00:40:03,361 --> 00:40:04,452
Here you go.

539
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:07,278
Thank you.

540
00:41:05,484 --> 00:41:06,934
What are you doing?

541
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,280
Drinking wine.

542
00:41:21,532 --> 00:41:22,632
How are you?

543
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:28,009
How did everything go today?

544
00:41:33,886 --> 00:41:36,160
I got booed at the pep rally.

545
00:41:37,211 --> 00:41:38,861
What do you mean booed?

546
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:42,282
I mean booed.

547
00:41:51,829 --> 00:41:54,629
But I did get one little bit
of satisfaction.

548
00:41:57,334 --> 00:42:00,950
Just being able to stand up
to those good old boys,

549
00:42:01,344 --> 00:42:02,994
Joe McCoy and his crew.

550
00:42:06,561 --> 00:42:08,277
So I got that going for me.

551
00:42:08,402 --> 00:42:09,500
And wine.

552
00:42:15,923 --> 00:42:17,273
How was your day?

553
00:42:20,014 --> 00:42:21,264
They showed up.

554
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,760
They did?

555
00:42:25,288 --> 00:42:26,438
It's a start.

556
00:42:27,412 --> 00:42:28,563
That's great.

557
00:42:35,658 --> 00:42:37,008
I'm sorry I lied.

558
00:42:39,148 --> 00:42:40,148
I know.
