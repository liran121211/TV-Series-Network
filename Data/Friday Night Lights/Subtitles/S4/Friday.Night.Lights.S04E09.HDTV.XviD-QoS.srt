1
00:00:35,319 --> 00:00:38,387
- To you, to our fearless leader!
- To all of y'all, to everybody!

2
00:00:38,642 --> 00:00:39,689
Oh, Glenn!

3
00:00:40,532 --> 00:00:42,191
You wanna go to car wash?

4
00:00:43,393 --> 00:00:44,261
Sure.

5
00:00:44,524 --> 00:00:45,795
Why the hell not?

6
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:47,227
You have a gun? Yes or no?

7
00:00:49,025 --> 00:00:50,066
There you go.

8
00:00:50,234 --> 00:00:52,443
I'm offering you
everything I've got.

9
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,770
This is not just about football.

10
00:00:54,938 --> 00:00:56,939
- This is it.
- It's beautiful.

11
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,382
How you doing, today?

12
00:01:06,507 --> 00:01:09,207
I'm Coach Taylor,
I was looking for Dallas.

13
00:01:09,578 --> 00:01:12,328
- Are you his sister?
- Yeah, he's not here.

14
00:01:12,589 --> 00:01:16,292
Hasn't showed up for practice for days,
I was wondering where he is.

15
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:19,128
You wanna find him?
He's probably at Carrol Park.

16
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:21,964
- He hangs there all the time.
- Carrol Park?

17
00:01:23,534 --> 00:01:26,194
You do me a favor, if you see him,
you tell him I stopped by?

18
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,571
- All right.
- All right, thank you.

19
00:02:05,129 --> 00:02:08,344
I know you get this a lot,
but how accurate are your tests?

20
00:02:09,223 --> 00:02:11,073
But they can be wrong, right?

21
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,453
Yeah.

22
00:02:14,315 --> 00:02:16,218
Okay, so I just take it again?

23
00:02:16,597 --> 00:02:17,550
Thanks.

24
00:02:24,528 --> 00:02:26,395
We'll hold on to this and...

25
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,831
I'll give you a call
if something opens up.

26
00:02:28,999 --> 00:02:32,134
I thought we were gonna do an interview.
On the phone, that's what you said.

27
00:02:32,433 --> 00:02:35,691
We're not really ready
to make a decision right now, but...

28
00:02:35,982 --> 00:02:38,617
I'll definitely keep
your application on file.

29
00:02:38,903 --> 00:02:41,510
- "On file"? What does that mean?
- We'll call you.

30
00:02:41,678 --> 00:02:43,679
If something opens up,
I'll call you.

31
00:02:43,847 --> 00:02:45,844
This is the number
right here, right?

32
00:02:46,528 --> 00:02:47,828
Yeah, that's it.

33
00:02:48,654 --> 00:02:49,608
Thanks.

34
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:07,770
Farmer's up.

35
00:03:26,945 --> 00:03:27,945
Excuse me.

36
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,031
May I ask you a question?

37
00:03:30,156 --> 00:03:32,061
Looking for a fellow
named Dallas Tinker.

38
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:34,697
You know him by chance?
He's a player of mine, I'm his coach.

39
00:03:34,865 --> 00:03:37,066
- Heard he would be out in this park.
- Tinker who?

40
00:03:37,386 --> 00:03:38,486
Tinkerbell?

41
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:40,937
Y'all do me favor if you would...

42
00:03:41,105 --> 00:03:43,639
If you see him, just tell him
his coach is looking for him.

43
00:03:44,172 --> 00:03:46,375
Look like some damn messager
to you, Coach?

44
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:09,623
Everybody get back, please!
Sheriff department.

45
00:04:09,748 --> 00:04:13,448
43 County, we're out in Carrol
and we have a shooting victim...

46
00:04:17,567 --> 00:04:19,175
Everybody step back.
Step back!

47
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,812
Are there any witnesses around here?
You guys seen anything?

48
00:04:23,056 --> 00:04:24,951
Can you tell me how old you are?

49
00:04:25,924 --> 00:04:28,150
Great.
Are you having any trouble breathing?

50
00:04:28,318 --> 00:04:30,586
Notify EMS
that he's having trouble breathing.

51
00:04:31,649 --> 00:04:33,699
4x09: THE LIGHTS OF CARROL PARK

Subtitles: Team Lions
With the participation of:

53
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:43,766
Benj!, Collioure, DarKsh,

54
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:26,008
Hey, hon.
Good morning.

55
00:05:27,153 --> 00:05:29,145
- How are ya?
- Good. Where is dad?

56
00:05:29,457 --> 00:05:31,438
He had to go down
the police station,

57
00:05:31,563 --> 00:05:34,383
you know, for that whole thing
that happened last night.

58
00:05:35,343 --> 00:05:38,653
Feel like you guys are never in the same
place at the same time anymore.

59
00:05:39,181 --> 00:05:40,606
I kind of do, too.

60
00:05:42,784 --> 00:05:45,535
Are you excited
for Habitat for Humanity today?

61
00:05:48,322 --> 00:05:49,599
I'm getting there.

62
00:05:50,378 --> 00:05:52,602
Good.
Think you're gonna enjoy it.

63
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,456
Yeah, you should know, you're the one
who forced me to sign up for it.

64
00:05:55,581 --> 00:05:59,130
I did not force you to sign... No!

65
00:05:59,316 --> 00:06:03,179
You did. "Juls, it's gonna look great on
your applications, you should sign up."

66
00:06:03,347 --> 00:06:06,248
It's gonna be great
for your college applications.

67
00:06:07,036 --> 00:06:08,551
Get ready. We got to go.

68
00:06:09,715 --> 00:06:11,120
How did that boy do last night?

69
00:06:11,823 --> 00:06:13,573
The kid is gonna be okay.

70
00:06:13,986 --> 00:06:15,549
Let me ask you something, Coach.

71
00:06:15,674 --> 00:06:18,289
I saw your name on the witness list.

72
00:06:18,526 --> 00:06:20,930
- What were you doing there?
- Got 1 of my players not showing up

73
00:06:21,098 --> 00:06:23,351
for practice,
I was looking for him, he's fine.

74
00:06:23,476 --> 00:06:25,620
Said that, that park I saw
was that dangerous at night?

75
00:06:25,745 --> 00:06:28,371
Look, Coach,
you can't man a park 24/7.

76
00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:31,634
I'm not asking you that. I got
a lot of players that live in the area.

77
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,022
So I'm trying to find out

78
00:06:33,147 --> 00:06:35,745
if we can get one extra person down
there and get the lights turned on.

79
00:06:35,913 --> 00:06:37,713
Look, Coach,
I completely urderstand,

80
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:41,183
but I've been to Mayor Rodell myself
and she can't even do anything for me.

81
00:06:41,308 --> 00:06:44,028
Now it's all about
a matter of resources, all right?

82
00:06:44,472 --> 00:06:45,755
And we just ain't got them.

83
00:06:47,103 --> 00:06:49,332
It's always about the money,
isn't it?

84
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,390
How you doing?

85
00:06:58,969 --> 00:07:00,569
I was due for rinse,

86
00:07:00,737 --> 00:07:03,454
so I had to borrow your shower,
if that's cool.

87
00:07:05,121 --> 00:07:05,947
Cool.

88
00:07:07,497 --> 00:07:08,597
Hey, just...

89
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:12,623
Are you all right?

90
00:07:13,077 --> 00:07:14,127
Yeah, fine.

91
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:19,780
Good times.

92
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:21,992
Hey, Coach!

93
00:07:22,117 --> 00:07:23,267
Coach Taylor.

94
00:07:24,028 --> 00:07:26,429
- Hey, Glenn, how are you?
- Good. How you doing?

95
00:07:26,597 --> 00:07:28,831
- How's everything on the west side?
- It's good.

96
00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:31,667
- Sorry to drop in on you like this.
- It's all right, what do you need?

97
00:07:32,282 --> 00:07:33,282
Look, I...

98
00:07:33,695 --> 00:07:36,639
I just wanna say I really appreciate you
just taking the high road

99
00:07:36,807 --> 00:07:38,016
like this, I really do.

100
00:07:38,141 --> 00:07:40,810
I mean, I'm a science teacher,
I know how these things work

101
00:07:40,978 --> 00:07:43,145
with adrenaline and hormones...
And by all accounts,

102
00:07:43,313 --> 00:07:45,681
you got every right to just deck me,
just tell me go to hell...

103
00:07:45,849 --> 00:07:47,316
What are you talking about?

104
00:07:48,288 --> 00:07:49,327
Does she not...

105
00:07:50,705 --> 00:07:52,722
Did Tami not tell you
what happened the other night?

106
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:54,701
No...

107
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:02,333
This is a little awkward, I just...

108
00:08:04,545 --> 00:08:05,995
I kissed your wife.

109
00:08:06,484 --> 00:08:08,546
Please, please don't hit me.
I just...

110
00:08:08,671 --> 00:08:11,907
I came here to apologize
and to explain myself, I...

111
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,343
We were at this karaoke bar,
everybody having a great time,

112
00:08:14,655 --> 00:08:18,214
and I just got a little excited, boy,
I was walking her to her cab, and...

113
00:08:18,382 --> 00:08:20,350
next thing I know, my lips are
on hers, I thought,

114
00:08:20,475 --> 00:08:22,587
"Wow, my mouth
is on Tami Taylor's mouth."

115
00:08:22,712 --> 00:08:25,364
And she pushed me back, and she told me,
"That can never happen again."

116
00:08:25,489 --> 00:08:27,089
And that's why I came here, Coach.

117
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:28,879
I had to get if off my chest.

118
00:08:37,978 --> 00:08:39,502
I don't know what else to say.

119
00:08:42,295 --> 00:08:44,073
I guess I'll see you around
at the game

120
00:08:44,241 --> 00:08:46,275
- or something.
- You'll see me sooner than that.

121
00:08:48,174 --> 00:08:49,174
I'm sorry.

122
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,013
I'm really sorry, I'm sorry.

123
00:08:54,941 --> 00:08:56,218
I appreciate you coming in.

124
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:00,556
Well, I needed to talk to you
because we had a problem with J.D.

125
00:09:00,724 --> 00:09:03,593
He called his math teacher a bitch,

126
00:09:03,862 --> 00:09:05,762
and was disrespectful to me.

127
00:09:06,027 --> 00:09:08,230
And he will be in detention
for the next week,

128
00:09:08,398 --> 00:09:10,512
which means he will miss
some practice.

129
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:12,535
I wanted to let you know that.

130
00:09:15,694 --> 00:09:17,940
Well, I think that's for the best.

131
00:09:19,445 --> 00:09:21,095
- You do?
- Yes, I do.

132
00:09:22,188 --> 00:09:24,638
J.D. has been
a real handful, of late.

133
00:09:25,249 --> 00:09:27,918
I tried to talk to him,
he won't listen to me...

134
00:09:28,726 --> 00:09:32,426
You know, he's just cannot go around
treating people like crap.

135
00:09:34,384 --> 00:09:35,633
Well, that's right.

136
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,910
There need to be consequences.

137
00:09:38,095 --> 00:09:39,729
There do need to be consequences.

138
00:09:40,742 --> 00:09:41,931
I mean, he has...

139
00:09:42,341 --> 00:09:44,900
acted out a lot since the split.

140
00:09:45,068 --> 00:09:46,810
I'm not trying to make excuses...

141
00:09:46,935 --> 00:09:49,029
When you say "split", I'm sorry...

142
00:09:49,508 --> 00:09:51,307
You don't mean you and Katie?

143
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:55,715
- You didn't know?
- No, I'm so sorry.

144
00:09:57,574 --> 00:09:59,081
Feels like everybody in town knows.

145
00:09:59,249 --> 00:10:01,249
No, I didn't know, I'm sorry.

146
00:10:04,297 --> 00:10:05,797
It happens, I guess.

147
00:10:07,322 --> 00:10:09,425
I guess it can happen to anybody.

148
00:10:12,563 --> 00:10:13,663
Yes, it can.

149
00:10:14,998 --> 00:10:17,333
One, two, three

150
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:20,953
four, five, six, seven...

151
00:10:21,342 --> 00:10:24,440
- You talked to Mayor Rodell lately?
- No, not too much.

152
00:10:24,608 --> 00:10:26,670
She's not too happy
with me after that...

153
00:10:27,013 --> 00:10:28,444
mailbox incident.

154
00:10:29,635 --> 00:10:31,835
Was over at Carrol Pak last night.

155
00:10:32,483 --> 00:10:34,730
12-year-old kid got shot over there.

156
00:10:34,985 --> 00:10:37,620
Most of them are living in that area.
I wanted to talk to the mayor,

157
00:10:37,788 --> 00:10:41,724
- maybe get the lights turned on.
- Yeah, I'm sorry about that, Eric.

158
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:43,273
But that's a good idea.

159
00:10:43,398 --> 00:10:46,295
- Take back the park, I love that.
- I'm not trying to take anything back.

160
00:10:46,463 --> 00:10:49,065
- Just want to get it cleaned up a bit.
- Okay, I'll talk to her.

161
00:10:49,374 --> 00:10:51,033
Maybe we can raise money.

162
00:10:51,201 --> 00:10:52,841
What? You said she was mad at you.

163
00:10:52,966 --> 00:10:54,980
Well, she is.
But you know, we go back.

164
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:57,296
We have a little history, you know?

165
00:10:57,421 --> 00:10:59,241
Before she starts playing
for the other team.

166
00:10:59,762 --> 00:11:01,043
You know what I mean?

167
00:11:03,267 --> 00:11:05,917
- I'll talk to her.
- All right, let's go!

168
00:11:10,755 --> 00:11:12,688
It's looking good, Julie.
Nice work.

169
00:11:13,608 --> 00:11:14,565
Thanks.

170
00:11:15,857 --> 00:11:16,859
It's Ryan, right?

171
00:11:18,673 --> 00:11:20,382
It's harder the first day.

172
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,931
To work out.

173
00:11:23,588 --> 00:11:26,198
It's a lot harder to Habitat
*** than I thought.

174
00:11:26,323 --> 00:11:27,723
I know, it can be.

175
00:11:28,301 --> 00:11:30,016
It's kind of why
I hate to tell you this,

176
00:11:30,141 --> 00:11:32,028
but this is the closet,

177
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:35,244
and you were supposed
to tile the bathroom.

178
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:39,706
- You're joking?
- It's an easy mistake to make.

179
00:11:39,831 --> 00:11:41,689
It happens a lot
when we move this fast.

180
00:11:41,814 --> 00:11:44,325
So what? I take it all out and...

181
00:11:44,964 --> 00:11:46,222
retile over there?

182
00:11:46,804 --> 00:11:48,057
That's pretty much it.

183
00:11:50,327 --> 00:11:53,304
I'm sorry, I should have been
more focused on it, I just have....

184
00:11:53,605 --> 00:11:56,098
so much many things going on
right now and I just...

185
00:11:56,266 --> 00:11:57,416
I don't know.

186
00:11:57,966 --> 00:11:59,874
Well, building is a little like...

187
00:12:00,571 --> 00:12:02,204
meditation, you have to...

188
00:12:02,372 --> 00:12:04,204
keep your brain in the moment.

189
00:12:04,726 --> 00:12:06,475
Believe me, I learned the hard way.

190
00:12:08,164 --> 00:12:09,211
No worries, though.

191
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:12,763
I'm gonna give you a hand,
we're gonna get this done in no time.

192
00:12:13,426 --> 00:12:14,656
It's the fun part.

193
00:12:14,781 --> 00:12:15,735
Thanks.

194
00:12:21,258 --> 00:12:22,608
You got a second?

195
00:12:29,497 --> 00:12:30,499
What you need?

196
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:33,169
I need some cash.

197
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:36,427
I need to bring it in
like yesterday.

198
00:12:36,908 --> 00:12:38,758
I've been trying to find some work,

199
00:12:39,055 --> 00:12:41,777
but there's not a lot of jobs out there
that's cool with me having a record.

200
00:12:43,255 --> 00:12:45,419
And I was wondering
if you could help.

201
00:12:46,303 --> 00:12:48,084
You're asking me
to look around for you?

202
00:12:48,861 --> 00:12:50,575
If you hear of anything.

203
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,562
An application has references.

204
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,279
And I wanted to know if...

205
00:12:55,588 --> 00:12:58,814
you were cool with me giving your number
as a reference, if they call, you...

206
00:12:59,124 --> 00:13:00,994
just say I'm playing
football for you,

207
00:13:01,119 --> 00:13:03,199
and I'm doing good.

208
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:06,399
And stuff.

209
00:13:08,685 --> 00:13:09,805
You do that

210
00:13:09,973 --> 00:13:11,568
and I'll look around for you.

211
00:13:11,915 --> 00:13:12,642
Really?

212
00:13:12,908 --> 00:13:15,344
You ask me to ask around for you,
I'm gonna ask around for you.

213
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:19,200
Thanks.

214
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:21,017
I appreciate it.

215
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:41,835
I need to talk to you.

216
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:46,850
Yeah, it's funny because I wanted
to talk to for a while, actually.

217
00:13:47,239 --> 00:13:50,624
- I'm kind of feeling like we're just...
- I've got some bad news, okay?

218
00:13:51,084 --> 00:13:52,179
I'm pregnant,

219
00:13:52,304 --> 00:13:54,584
and it's yours,
and I need an abortion.

220
00:13:55,899 --> 00:13:58,154
It's really expensive,
it's like $300.

221
00:14:01,378 --> 00:14:03,059
I don't have all of it right now.

222
00:14:04,684 --> 00:14:07,663
But I can come up with half
if you can come up with the other half.

223
00:14:10,815 --> 00:14:12,201
You talked to your mom, right?

224
00:14:13,245 --> 00:14:14,370
I'm doing this.

225
00:14:14,538 --> 00:14:17,106
You don't have to be involved
or anything,

226
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:19,356
but I just really need help
with the money.

227
00:14:22,315 --> 00:14:23,116
Yes.

228
00:14:24,868 --> 00:14:26,616
Please, don't tell anyone.
Please.

229
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,282
Just let me know
if you can get the money.

230
00:14:49,977 --> 00:14:51,827
I ran into Glenn yesterday.

231
00:14:54,156 --> 00:14:55,564
Glenn science teacher?

232
00:14:55,689 --> 00:14:57,639
Yeah, he came over to school.

233
00:15:02,623 --> 00:15:03,819
What did he have to say?

234
00:15:04,587 --> 00:15:06,574
He just wanted to share
a little experience

235
00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:08,824
he had over at the karaoke party.

236
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:10,426
Honey, what did he tell you?

237
00:15:11,123 --> 00:15:12,929
Why don't you tell me
what he told me?

238
00:15:13,097 --> 00:15:16,822
Honey, he was so drunk.
He was so drunk.

239
00:15:16,947 --> 00:15:19,601
And I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
But I've been wanting to tell you

240
00:15:19,726 --> 00:15:22,338
- but we haven't really had one minute.
- You kissed Glenn?

241
00:15:22,669 --> 00:15:24,240
You didn't hit him, did you?

242
00:15:24,408 --> 00:15:27,109
No, I didn't hit him.
What do you worry about him for?

243
00:15:27,234 --> 00:15:29,837
You just happen to get kissed
by so many people over at school

244
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:32,448
you just forget to even talk about it,
is that why?

245
00:15:32,912 --> 00:15:35,729
Don't blame the victim.
I'm the victim here, honey.

246
00:15:35,854 --> 00:15:38,633
Do you realize by proxy
I have now kissed Glenn?

247
00:15:38,758 --> 00:15:41,657
- Honey, that's awful. That's awful.
- Yeah!

248
00:15:43,453 --> 00:15:45,303
Honey, did you hear that...

249
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:48,831
Joe and Katie McCoy
are getting a divorce?

250
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,680
Honey...

251
00:16:01,883 --> 00:16:03,512
I think we need a date.

252
00:16:04,118 --> 00:16:05,818
I got one date with you.

253
00:16:06,116 --> 00:16:08,384
- The post-baby damn date.
- All right.

254
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:10,264
- Crack open some wine...
- Really?

255
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:13,256
If we check to make sure
it's got some nice legs,

256
00:16:13,381 --> 00:16:16,095
check to make sure what year it is,
if you want bigger legs.

257
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,815
- Big M!
- Hey, Buddy.

258
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:18,945
How you doing?

259
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:21,859
- I'm good, man. How about yourself?
- Good, good.

260
00:16:22,108 --> 00:16:23,625
Well, let's see. I'll have...

261
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,534
You'll have some baby back ribs,

262
00:16:25,702 --> 00:16:28,008
a side of collard and fruitage.
You get 'em every damn time.

263
00:16:28,133 --> 00:16:29,872
- Let the money on the counter.
- And...

264
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,575
Extra BBQ sauce.
I know, I know.

265
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:35,411
Hey, where are you coming from?
Prom?

266
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:38,046
No, I went to see Mayor Rodell.

267
00:16:38,171 --> 00:16:41,231
Well, well, well...
Ain't you special?

268
00:16:41,356 --> 00:16:45,154
No, I'm just trying to get the lights
turned back on over at Carrol Park

269
00:16:45,322 --> 00:16:47,525
so we can clean
the park up a little bit.

270
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:49,225
- Is that right?
- That's right.

271
00:16:50,261 --> 00:16:51,827
You're an idiot, Buddy.

272
00:16:53,472 --> 00:16:54,363
What?

273
00:16:54,531 --> 00:16:55,731
You're an idiot.

274
00:16:55,856 --> 00:16:57,934
That's really funny, big M.
Why are you saying that?

275
00:16:58,102 --> 00:17:00,937
You're an idiot for thinking your Snow
White ass can make a difference.

276
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,173
Do you realize that the other night,
when that little boy got shot,

277
00:17:04,402 --> 00:17:06,190
Coach Taylor was in the park?

278
00:17:06,315 --> 00:17:07,583
Coach Taylor...

279
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:08,805
Yeah, it figures.

280
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:12,634
You know, we're trying to organize.
And maybe you could just

281
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:15,751
help us out a little bit
instead of criticizing.

282
00:17:16,206 --> 00:17:18,356
You're gonna get your ass kicked.

283
00:17:19,117 --> 00:17:20,122
Here's your food.

284
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:29,799
And I might need
some water, too, please.

285
00:17:40,043 --> 00:17:41,043
Look...

286
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:47,984
You gonna need somebody who can
talk to these kids. I know a guy.

287
00:17:48,492 --> 00:17:51,487
He's an ex gangster.
He does community work now.

288
00:17:56,322 --> 00:17:58,222
I'll get that water for you.

289
00:18:09,741 --> 00:18:10,841
I should go.

290
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,146
Yeah, I gotta work.

291
00:18:15,271 --> 00:18:17,510
You know,
that's why I gotta go, so...

292
00:18:18,027 --> 00:18:20,451
Well, can I see you later?

293
00:18:23,423 --> 00:18:26,287
I work until closing,
it's a restaurant, and...

294
00:18:26,412 --> 00:18:27,657
What about tomorrow night?

295
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,159
I work every night.

296
00:18:31,589 --> 00:18:35,197
This is, like, the first step
to us breaking up.

297
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:37,867
- You just pulled me off.
- Yeah. That's what this is.

298
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:40,982
- The beginning of the end?
- Yeah, I can't lie.

299
00:18:42,405 --> 00:18:44,674
Why don't you come after
closing tomorrow night?

300
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,960
Okay.

301
00:18:47,597 --> 00:18:48,947
Help me clean up?

302
00:18:49,771 --> 00:18:50,880
What does that mean?

303
00:18:51,355 --> 00:18:52,905
Use your imagination.

304
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:57,819
All right, Jess.

305
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:01,958
Looks pretty good, yeah?

306
00:19:04,461 --> 00:19:05,439
So...

307
00:19:06,753 --> 00:19:09,498
How long you've been doing this,
like, working for Habitat?

308
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:11,516
I've been doing it a while.

309
00:19:12,224 --> 00:19:14,581
I did my first one 'cause I thought
it'd be good for my résumé,

310
00:19:14,706 --> 00:19:16,205
and I just kinda got hooked.

311
00:19:17,433 --> 00:19:18,975
I can see how that would happen.

312
00:19:20,343 --> 00:19:23,039
So, I was gonna grab
some food after.

313
00:19:23,511 --> 00:19:25,561
Thought maybe you'd wanna come.

314
00:19:31,457 --> 00:19:34,596
Look, you're really nice...

315
00:19:35,361 --> 00:19:36,559
and really cute,

316
00:19:37,738 --> 00:19:39,016
but I wanna be honest.

317
00:19:39,141 --> 00:19:43,145
I got out of a really long,
very serious relationship, and...

318
00:19:45,537 --> 00:19:47,069
I'm still broken.

319
00:19:47,237 --> 00:19:50,837
You know what? I get it.
I really do. I've been there myself.

320
00:19:59,987 --> 00:20:00,850
But...

321
00:20:01,195 --> 00:20:02,345
What if we...

322
00:20:03,809 --> 00:20:06,222
didn't go to lunch or anything?
What if we...

323
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,624
just were spontaneous
and lived in the moment

324
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:11,998
and just kissed
and there'd be no strings attached?

325
00:20:13,632 --> 00:20:15,197
Would that be weird?

326
00:20:18,824 --> 00:20:20,202
No, that wouldn't be weird.

327
00:20:22,967 --> 00:20:24,141
That'd be okay.

328
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,535
All right, I'll give you a call.

329
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:46,495
I thought she would never go down.
She was crying so much.

330
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:49,432
Look, I got us the wine.
I need it right now.

331
00:20:52,069 --> 00:20:53,603
I need to take a rain check.

332
00:20:54,494 --> 00:20:56,906
Buddy just talked to Virgil,
Virgil knows a fella.

333
00:20:57,074 --> 00:21:00,509
If we could talk to him, he might be
able to help us with this park situation

334
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:02,389
but it's gotta be tonight.

335
00:21:04,465 --> 00:21:05,565
All right...

336
00:21:06,344 --> 00:21:07,544
You all right?

337
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,685
I mean...
What am I gonna do?

338
00:21:10,953 --> 00:21:11,954
Thank you.

339
00:21:12,122 --> 00:21:13,672
I'll just call Glenn.

340
00:21:13,797 --> 00:21:16,492
If you call Glenn, make sure
he doesn't drink all my scotch.

341
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,745
I'm not making any guarantees
about what Glenn is gonna do or not do.

342
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:21,812
I'll see you later tonight.

343
00:21:23,811 --> 00:21:24,811
Good luck.

344
00:21:28,227 --> 00:21:29,667
Eric Taylor, Elden Crumpler.

345
00:21:29,792 --> 00:21:31,874
Hey, how are you doin'?
Nice to meet you.

346
00:21:32,384 --> 00:21:33,976
Buddy Garrity. Good to meet you.

347
00:21:35,207 --> 00:21:36,257
Come on in.

348
00:21:38,982 --> 00:21:40,082
Thanks much.

349
00:21:40,714 --> 00:21:41,874
Nice place.

350
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,020
- How long have you been here?
- Since I got out of jail.

351
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,884
What exactly can I do for you?

352
00:21:49,964 --> 00:21:52,795
Well, we're trying
to clean up Carrol Park.

353
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,864
Take it back.

354
00:21:55,186 --> 00:21:56,332
Take it back from who?

355
00:21:56,744 --> 00:21:58,868
We're nice.
We don't wanna take anything back.

356
00:21:59,233 --> 00:22:03,005
We're trying to get the lights turned on
there. I got players who live there.

357
00:22:03,173 --> 00:22:07,043
We're trying to make some space for them
to have somewhere safe to be at night.

358
00:22:08,249 --> 00:22:10,012
I don't wanna offend you, Coach.

359
00:22:10,573 --> 00:22:13,516
I'm sure you're a great football man
like everybody say, but...

360
00:22:14,092 --> 00:22:16,552
there are more problems down there
than just the lights won't work.

361
00:22:17,292 --> 00:22:21,042
So my question to you is:
do you really wanna make a difference,

362
00:22:21,483 --> 00:22:24,226
or are you just feeling sad
because you saw a boy got shot?

363
00:22:28,024 --> 00:22:28,831
Both.

364
00:22:32,127 --> 00:22:33,569
This is what we need.

365
00:22:35,016 --> 00:22:36,672
We need money, for programs.

366
00:22:37,684 --> 00:22:39,942
We need some
of the local businesses like Virgil here

367
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,409
and Buddy here, to send a little
something-something our way.

368
00:22:43,534 --> 00:22:46,549
And not just this week
because there's a boy in a hospital.

369
00:22:47,188 --> 00:22:51,018
As far as the great white hope coming in
from the football field to save the day,

370
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:55,124
those kids can't see you as an outsider.
They'd smell that a mile away.

371
00:22:55,505 --> 00:22:56,926
It'd do more harm than good.

372
00:22:57,189 --> 00:22:59,295
We need to give them a reason
to believe in this thing,

373
00:22:59,714 --> 00:23:02,925
- whatever this thing is.
- Well, I got an idea.

374
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,234
I think we ought
to have a football game.

375
00:23:05,402 --> 00:23:07,870
- Football game?
- I think we ought to get the Lions

376
00:23:08,124 --> 00:23:09,662
versus the kids at the park,

378
00:23:11,608 --> 00:23:13,976
That doesn't sound like a bad idea.
Go ahead.

379
00:23:14,785 --> 00:23:16,142
Good clean fun.

380
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:19,701
No, no, wait.
Friday night, we got a by.

381
00:23:19,887 --> 00:23:21,887
We could do it saturday night.

382
00:23:23,251 --> 00:23:24,860
What do you think, Elden?

383
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:27,490
Well, the kids do love the football.

384
00:23:28,018 --> 00:23:29,492
Everyone loves football.

385
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:38,601
Most important is it's voluntary.
If you wanna be out there, that's great,

386
00:23:38,859 --> 00:23:41,771
if you don't, that's fine, too.
As a matter of fact, if you don't,

387
00:23:41,939 --> 00:23:43,501
I don't want you out there.

388
00:23:43,626 --> 00:23:47,576
But if you do, know there'll be some
rules. We're not gonna have street ball.

389
00:23:47,744 --> 00:23:50,079
We're gonna stick to those rules,
understood?

390
00:23:50,247 --> 00:23:51,814
- Yes, sir.
- Understood?

391
00:23:51,982 --> 00:23:54,317
- All right. Good. Tinker!
- Yes, sir!

392
00:23:54,485 --> 00:23:56,452
Break 'em down.
Vince, I wanna talk to you.

393
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,370
Let's go, baby, let's go!

394
00:23:58,717 --> 00:24:01,290
- What's up?
- Listen, I talked to Big Merri.

395
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:05,093
He's got something over there for you.
Possibly dishwasher or busboy.

396
00:24:05,218 --> 00:24:07,339
- At Ray's Barbeque?
- That's right.

397
00:24:08,059 --> 00:24:09,561
Coach, that wasn't...

398
00:24:09,811 --> 00:24:13,336
- That's not what I was expecting...
- What do you mean? It's a job.

399
00:24:13,504 --> 00:24:16,472
You show up, you work, you get paid.
That's why you want the job, right?

400
00:24:17,201 --> 00:24:19,779
All right. Then show up this afternoon
and see what he's got to say.

401
00:24:19,904 --> 00:24:22,364
Don't let me down,
I stuck my neck out for you.

402
00:24:23,678 --> 00:24:25,348
You be here all the time.

403
00:24:25,473 --> 00:24:28,918
Work hard. No flirting with the girls,
no jaw-jacking with the guys.

404
00:24:29,086 --> 00:24:32,255
Somebody come in and tell you how great
you was on friday night, you thank him,

405
00:24:32,423 --> 00:24:33,756
and you get back to work.

406
00:24:34,202 --> 00:24:36,576
- Yes, sir.
- We'll start you up at a minimum wage.

407
00:24:36,701 --> 00:24:39,462
If things work out, you'll get a raise
in another couple of months.

408
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:42,131
- That'll work. Thank you.
- It ain't gonna be a lot.

409
00:24:42,566 --> 00:24:45,301
- You ain't gonna get rich here.
- With all due respect, I want a job

410
00:24:45,999 --> 00:24:48,838
that, you know, keep me out of trouble,
plus the food on the table.

411
00:24:49,006 --> 00:24:50,006
That's it.

412
00:24:51,076 --> 00:24:52,126
Last thing:

413
00:24:53,053 --> 00:24:54,610
stay away from my daughter.

414
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:56,512
She don't want it,

415
00:24:57,094 --> 00:24:58,344
I don't either.

416
00:25:00,005 --> 00:25:02,451
- Understood.
- I ain't gonna remind you of that one.

417
00:25:02,966 --> 00:25:04,664
If I see anything I don't like,

418
00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:06,956
you got to find new employment
elsewhere. Are we clear?

419
00:25:07,918 --> 00:25:09,058
Crystal clear.

420
00:25:10,918 --> 00:25:12,461
Go in the back.
Get you an apron.

421
00:25:15,023 --> 00:25:17,733
- Thank you.
- Go in the back and get you an apron.

422
00:25:19,544 --> 00:25:20,544
Yes, sir.

423
00:25:29,193 --> 00:25:30,243
Hey, honey.

424
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:34,999
I just wanted to come by
and see how it's going. This is great!

425
00:25:35,124 --> 00:25:36,574
Pretty cool, right?

426
00:25:38,312 --> 00:25:40,686
You look like you know
what you're doing.

427
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:43,159
Kind of.

428
00:25:43,353 --> 00:25:44,353
Good.

429
00:25:44,595 --> 00:25:46,045
You're having fun?

430
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,097
I am. Actually,
I'm having a real good time.

431
00:25:48,617 --> 00:25:49,617
You are?

432
00:25:50,121 --> 00:25:51,126
I'm so glad.

433
00:25:51,251 --> 00:25:54,313
I'm so glad some smart person
encouraged you to do this.

434
00:25:54,438 --> 00:25:56,884
"So glad some smart person..."

435
00:25:58,609 --> 00:26:01,243
- Who is this, honey?
- Hold on. I'll be back.

436
00:26:01,411 --> 00:26:02,712
I'll watch your saw.

437
00:26:04,141 --> 00:26:07,249
So we need to get the measurements
on this railing, all right?

438
00:26:07,417 --> 00:26:11,220
I'm gonna use it on the pressure treated
wood out back. Can you handle it?

439
00:26:12,133 --> 00:26:15,191
I think I can handle it.
You're such a dork.

440
00:26:19,371 --> 00:26:21,097
No wonder
you're having such a good time.

441
00:26:22,239 --> 00:26:23,289
Who's that?

442
00:26:24,996 --> 00:26:27,303
That's Ryan.
He works for Habitat.

443
00:26:28,543 --> 00:26:30,043
Nice. He seems nice.

444
00:26:31,825 --> 00:26:34,076
Is there something
you wanna tell me about Ryan?

445
00:26:42,292 --> 00:26:43,292
But...

446
00:26:44,751 --> 00:26:47,051
I will say that I feel a lot better.

447
00:26:47,669 --> 00:26:48,824
I'm glad, honey.

448
00:26:50,215 --> 00:26:51,315
I really am.

449
00:27:03,278 --> 00:27:06,589
Make sure you get real good
underneath that one right there.

450
00:27:06,986 --> 00:27:09,946
I can clean up a toilet by myself,
thank you.

451
00:27:10,158 --> 00:27:12,006
I'm just saying
there's no point in paying you

452
00:27:12,182 --> 00:27:16,176
to do a job if I'm gonna have to follow
after everything and clean up after you.

453
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,696
Seems my little brother
has cleaned toilets.

454
00:27:18,821 --> 00:27:20,971
Well, I'm not your little brother.

455
00:27:27,367 --> 00:27:28,855
Yeah, you're not.

456
00:27:38,316 --> 00:27:40,316
I can't believe you hired him.

457
00:27:41,713 --> 00:27:43,763
I'm doing a favor for somebody.

458
00:27:44,348 --> 00:27:46,333
Can't you do me a favor
and tell him to go home?

459
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:47,849
No, I can't do that.

460
00:27:48,228 --> 00:27:50,163
Working hard, doing a good job.

461
00:27:50,288 --> 00:27:53,322
After all the grief you gave me
about spending time with him?

462
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:55,358
It just seemed
like the right thing to do.

463
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:59,528
Besides, I trust you to take care
of yourself and make smart choices.

464
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:02,550
I appreciate you're trusting me.

465
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:05,031
I'm gonna scrub that grill.

466
00:28:12,577 --> 00:28:15,536
Look, I'm not even
here on my behalf.

467
00:28:16,273 --> 00:28:17,818
Skeeter's upset.

468
00:28:19,721 --> 00:28:20,814
All day.

469
00:28:21,345 --> 00:28:23,219
All day.
Don't care.

470
00:28:23,387 --> 00:28:25,087
- What?
- There you go.

471
00:28:26,527 --> 00:28:28,524
Just get it out
in the open, all right?

472
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:30,518
This kiss.

473
00:28:31,045 --> 00:28:34,228
You've been just awkward
and avoiding me, and...

474
00:28:34,353 --> 00:28:36,365
It's just weird
and I don't like it, so...

475
00:28:37,374 --> 00:28:38,661
I apologize.

476
00:28:39,322 --> 00:28:42,071
All right? It won't happen again.
It was a mistake.

477
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:46,158
Are we cool?

478
00:28:49,196 --> 00:28:50,546
Yeah, we're cool.

479
00:28:51,131 --> 00:28:52,137
Thanks...

480
00:28:52,262 --> 00:28:53,262
so much.

481
00:28:56,216 --> 00:28:58,111
Okay. Somehow,
I don't think we're cool.

482
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,663
Go away!

483
00:29:08,829 --> 00:29:11,836
- What are you doing here?
- I just left my jacket.

484
00:29:12,027 --> 00:29:13,677
Yeah, well, hurry up.

485
00:29:28,049 --> 00:29:29,051
Good night.

486
00:29:30,838 --> 00:29:31,888
Good night.

487
00:29:59,895 --> 00:30:00,969
Hey, Vince.

488
00:30:04,975 --> 00:30:06,225
How's it going?

489
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,830
We got some homework...
to do.

490
00:30:18,627 --> 00:30:20,007
Sorry...

491
00:30:46,947 --> 00:30:50,468
Can I just say something? I don't
wanna get in your business, but...

492
00:30:52,547 --> 00:30:54,870
I just wanna make sure
that you thought through everything.

493
00:30:55,152 --> 00:30:56,511
Look, I'm 16.

494
00:30:57,865 --> 00:31:00,343
I'm 16 and by the time I'm 17,
I'm gonna be a single parent.

495
00:31:02,456 --> 00:31:03,806
Just like my mom.

496
00:31:05,593 --> 00:31:08,684
You know, if this is about the money,
I can figure it out. Just let me know.

497
00:31:08,852 --> 00:31:10,720
It's not the money, all right?
I have some.

498
00:31:10,978 --> 00:31:12,989
- Then what's the problem?
- I'm just...

499
00:31:13,157 --> 00:31:16,039
I'm worried, all right? I haven't been
able to sleep last few nights.

500
00:31:16,164 --> 00:31:19,297
- What are you worried about?
- I'm worried about you, Becky.

501
00:31:19,422 --> 00:31:20,538
And I just...

502
00:31:20,663 --> 00:31:22,513
I mean, I feel responsible.

503
00:31:25,561 --> 00:31:27,169
That's a two-way street.

504
00:31:27,337 --> 00:31:29,387
No, that's not what I'm saying.

505
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,341
You're pregnant, all right?

506
00:31:32,509 --> 00:31:34,309
Whatever you decide to do,

507
00:31:34,583 --> 00:31:36,209
that's a huge decision.

508
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:38,881
A decision you'll have
to live with the rest of your life.

509
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:40,997
And I'm gonna have to live with.

510
00:31:42,075 --> 00:31:44,378
And it's not like
I wanna be a dad, all right?

511
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:46,503
But there's something about...

512
00:31:47,252 --> 00:31:49,625
not being one, you know?

513
00:31:49,793 --> 00:31:51,243
You not being a mom

514
00:31:51,814 --> 00:31:53,724
just because we decide
to make the baby go away,

515
00:31:53,849 --> 00:31:56,933
and that just makes me
really, really uncomfortable.

516
00:31:58,172 --> 00:31:59,631
You know what I mean?

517
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,369
Will you just take me home?

518
00:32:17,356 --> 00:32:20,960
Yo, man, I'm so hungry right now
I might be able to eat a whole damn pig.

519
00:32:21,085 --> 00:32:22,235
That's right!

520
00:32:22,638 --> 00:32:24,226
Yeah, man.
Don't ask, don't tell.

521
00:32:24,729 --> 00:32:26,684
You already know what it is.

522
00:32:27,317 --> 00:32:28,230
What's up?

523
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,971
- I see you in a minute.
- They got you sweeping there?

524
00:32:32,096 --> 00:32:33,803
- It's the job.
- If you need some money,

525
00:32:33,971 --> 00:32:37,041
- holla to your boy Calvin, man.
- What's up? You need something?

526
00:32:37,166 --> 00:32:39,342
We was thinking you was gonna
bring us something to eat.

527
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,407
How about some of them ribs?
Some of them collard greens, yo.

528
00:32:42,532 --> 00:32:44,780
Go to the counter order to Big Merr.
He'll take care of you.

529
00:32:45,273 --> 00:32:47,183
Come on, dog.
Just bring in some damn food, man.

530
00:32:48,262 --> 00:32:50,119
You're hungry?
You wanna eat?

531
00:32:50,771 --> 00:32:52,221
Like I said before,

532
00:32:52,423 --> 00:32:54,991
you gotta go inside like everybody else,
and order at the counter.

533
00:32:55,633 --> 00:32:58,127
- You can't even hook up your boys?
- What kind of crap job is this?

534
00:32:58,295 --> 00:33:00,162
Who's this dude?
You better chill out...

535
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:02,214
You tell me to chill out?!

536
00:33:06,056 --> 00:33:07,256
That's enough.

537
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:09,154
We're closing up.

538
00:33:09,684 --> 00:33:11,134
That means goodbye.

539
00:33:12,473 --> 00:33:13,565
You heard the man.

540
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:15,140
They're closing up.

541
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:17,567
No trouble, man.
Let's roll out.

542
00:33:19,281 --> 00:33:20,449
Let's roll.

543
00:33:38,428 --> 00:33:40,336
Look, I know this job ain't fun.

544
00:33:41,041 --> 00:33:43,741
But it pays,
and it keeps you out of joint.

545
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,771
You're better than them.

546
00:33:56,003 --> 00:33:57,103
No, I'm not.

547
00:33:59,421 --> 00:34:01,023
You're here, ain't you?

548
00:34:07,459 --> 00:34:08,709
Let's close up,

549
00:34:09,275 --> 00:34:10,766
and get on over to the park.

550
00:34:12,723 --> 00:34:13,723
Yes, sir.

551
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,766
Eric, what's...
Eric, what's the deal with the lights?

552
00:34:43,934 --> 00:34:45,935
Honey, you know the lights
aren't coming on, right?

553
00:34:46,103 --> 00:34:47,770
Honey, I know the lights aren't on.

554
00:34:47,938 --> 00:34:50,640
That's why I'm on the phone with
the city guy trying to get some answers.

555
00:34:50,808 --> 00:34:53,042
- Trying to get the lights turned on.
- Can I do something?

556
00:34:53,356 --> 00:34:54,877
No, there's nothing you can do.

557
00:34:55,045 --> 00:34:57,046
Eric, we need to speak...
We might have a problem.

558
00:34:57,214 --> 00:34:59,315
What?
That's the other team.

559
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:02,667
Right.

560
00:35:09,027 --> 00:35:10,092
Hi, y'all.

561
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,427
Have a good game.

562
00:35:11,595 --> 00:35:13,563
- Thanks for coming.
- Good game.

563
00:35:13,731 --> 00:35:14,831
How are you?

564
00:35:15,662 --> 00:35:16,666
Good game.

565
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,003
Hey Elden.

566
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:24,110
- Can I talk to you? Excuse me.
- Yeah, yeah.

567
00:35:25,109 --> 00:35:27,310
- What's up?
- We got a problem with these lights.

568
00:35:27,718 --> 00:35:29,768
Well, you gotta get into
the switch box over there.

569
00:35:29,893 --> 00:35:32,983
Would you have any knowledge of
how we might get past the padlock

570
00:35:33,108 --> 00:35:34,517
that's on the switch box?

571
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:49,832
What are you laughing at?

572
00:35:50,115 --> 00:35:51,520
That was funny.

573
00:35:54,329 --> 00:35:55,829
You guys be careful.

574
00:35:58,005 --> 00:35:59,008
Here it is.

575
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,282
- How's it going, ya'll? How you doing?
- What's going on?

576
00:36:07,063 --> 00:36:08,164
Hey, Vince.

577
00:36:11,382 --> 00:36:15,524
I'm not sure if there's something that
you feel like you need to say or do,

578
00:36:16,029 --> 00:36:18,830
and I realize that you and Jess
have some sort of history, but...

579
00:36:18,955 --> 00:36:20,997
I really do like her a lot
so if you...

580
00:36:21,283 --> 00:36:24,286
wanna hit me or
whatever it is that you need to do,

581
00:36:24,411 --> 00:36:27,036
I'd really like to get
past that at some point,

582
00:36:27,204 --> 00:36:29,739
'cause this is kind of getting
a little silly.

583
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,129
Your honor.

584
00:36:51,207 --> 00:36:52,707
What does that mean?

585
00:36:58,802 --> 00:37:01,270
Alright,
I want this to be a clean game.

586
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:03,339
I don't wanna see any crap.

587
00:37:03,717 --> 00:37:06,008
If I see any crap,
I'm gonna call it.

588
00:37:07,996 --> 00:37:09,995
- Ya'll got it?
- You got it, sir.

589
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,081
- Y'all got that?
- Yes, sir.

590
00:37:14,488 --> 00:37:15,567
All right.

591
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:17,192
- Call it.
- Heads.

592
00:37:19,204 --> 00:37:21,257
- Heads it is...
- Let's go!

593
00:37:21,425 --> 00:37:24,293
Alright, we got the lights on.
Let's have some fun! Let's go!

594
00:37:26,966 --> 00:37:28,366
Go get 'em, Lions.

595
00:37:40,395 --> 00:37:42,645
Man, it's little Vince,
it's little Vince, baby.

596
00:37:42,813 --> 00:37:45,615
- Ain't you on the wrong side, homey?
- You'll see. Come on, man.

597
00:37:45,783 --> 00:37:46,783
Ready.

598
00:37:55,484 --> 00:37:57,827
I told you you was
on the wrong side.

599
00:37:57,995 --> 00:38:00,062
- Next time, I'll just snap you two.
- Just try.

600
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:02,980
- Should I say something to my guys?
- No...

601
00:38:03,405 --> 00:38:04,520
It'll be alright.

602
00:38:05,736 --> 00:38:06,986
All right.

603
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:09,672
Listen.
I know these dudes, all right?

604
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,008
To beat them, we can't give up,
and we can't back down.

605
00:38:12,444 --> 00:38:14,343
Let's have some fun.
Put it at work, all right?

606
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,280
- On 3. 38 Jet. 1, 2, 3...
- Break!

607
00:38:26,743 --> 00:38:28,791
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good.

608
00:39:22,579 --> 00:39:25,247
- What's that kid's name?
- It's Maurice.

609
00:39:27,411 --> 00:39:28,411
Come here!

610
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:32,185
- How old are you?
- 13.

611
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:34,157
- What school do you go to?
- Kilroy Middle.

612
00:39:34,282 --> 00:39:35,691
- You like football?
- Yes.

613
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:38,060
Next year, you wanna play
football with me?

614
00:39:38,228 --> 00:39:41,197
- Of course.
- You come find me next year? Promise?

615
00:39:41,439 --> 00:39:43,065
Don't make me come
looking after you.

616
00:39:43,233 --> 00:39:44,724
- No, sir.
- All right. Do that.

617
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:46,395
- Thanks, Coach.
- All right.

618
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:51,507
- You make sure he comes see me?
- Yeah, you got it.

619
00:39:51,675 --> 00:39:52,675
All right.

620
00:40:08,253 --> 00:40:10,927
You know that it's not lost
on me that I owe you a date.

621
00:40:11,439 --> 00:40:13,176
It's not lost on me either, honey.

622
00:40:13,301 --> 00:40:15,015
While we may not be the McCoy's,

623
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:18,734
I also realize that our relationship
needs nurturing.

624
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:23,873
- What are you laughing at?
- It's funny.

625
00:40:24,711 --> 00:40:25,738
Nurturing.

626
00:40:25,863 --> 00:40:27,977
I'm not trying to be funny.
I'm being serious.

627
00:40:28,145 --> 00:40:30,168
Oh, honey,
I love you to pieces for that.

628
00:40:30,647 --> 00:40:32,748
- Honey, go left. Go left.
- What?

629
00:40:33,009 --> 00:40:34,009
Why?

630
00:40:34,134 --> 00:40:36,485
- Where are we going now?
- Honey, you'll see.

631
00:40:37,562 --> 00:40:38,562
Oh, man...

632
00:40:40,624 --> 00:40:42,046
That's gorgeous.

633
00:40:45,415 --> 00:40:46,565
So beautiful.

634
00:40:47,247 --> 00:40:49,462
Does that ring
any bells for you, hon?

635
00:40:53,674 --> 00:40:56,327
Remember...
Okay, not our first date,

636
00:40:56,928 --> 00:40:58,307
but our first date.

637
00:40:58,475 --> 00:41:01,177
That'd be our first date,
or first date?

638
00:41:01,345 --> 00:41:02,395
First date.

639
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,342
- I think I remember.
- Do you?

640
00:41:04,467 --> 00:41:07,334
You think you remember?
I wanna remind you of that.

641
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:10,046
I mean, it's been a long time.

642
00:41:10,921 --> 00:41:13,871
And you're old.
You're really old and grouchy.

643
00:41:18,489 --> 00:41:19,789
Damn I love you.

644
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,283
Damn I love you too, babe...

645
00:41:43,027 --> 00:41:45,855
- Can we talk?
- Yeah, you wanna come in, or...

646
00:41:46,444 --> 00:41:48,852
- Can you get out here?
- Yeah, absolutely.

647
00:41:50,325 --> 00:41:51,327
What's up?

648
00:41:51,799 --> 00:41:53,749
Just a couple things, really.

649
00:41:54,809 --> 00:41:56,132
First, it really...

650
00:41:57,431 --> 00:42:00,569
It really hurt me that you said
that kissing me was a mistake.

651
00:42:01,513 --> 00:42:05,194
Because I didn't think it was a mistake,
and that meant something to me.

652
00:42:07,253 --> 00:42:08,303
How come...

653
00:42:09,789 --> 00:42:11,213
I don't mean to hurt you, ever.

654
00:42:11,673 --> 00:42:12,673
It just...

655
00:42:16,111 --> 00:42:19,626
Since the kiss, it's been different.
You've been avoiding me, and...

656
00:42:19,751 --> 00:42:21,324
to be honest, you seem lost.

657
00:42:22,316 --> 00:42:23,316
So...

658
00:42:23,904 --> 00:42:26,245
I didn't know what else to say,
you know?

659
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:27,370
I felt...

660
00:42:27,856 --> 00:42:29,865
I just don't want to ruin
what we had before.

661
00:42:30,451 --> 00:42:31,451
That's it.

662
00:42:31,826 --> 00:42:33,169
Tim, I'm pregnant.

663
00:42:34,706 --> 00:42:35,706
What?

664
00:42:39,505 --> 00:42:40,655
I'm pregnant.

665
00:42:43,461 --> 00:42:45,748
And I don't know what I'm gonna do.

666
00:42:46,171 --> 00:42:47,216
And I am...

667
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,586
so scared...

668
00:42:51,656 --> 00:42:52,656
Come here.

669
00:42:55,921 --> 00:42:57,360
You're gonna be fine.

670
00:42:58,287 --> 00:43:00,613
- I don't know...
- It's gonna be fine.
