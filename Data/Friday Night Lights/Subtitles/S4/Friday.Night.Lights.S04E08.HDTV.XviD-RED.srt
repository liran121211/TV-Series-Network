1
00:00:05,336 --> 00:00:06,304
Son, you all right? -

2
00:00:06,338 --> 00:00:07,972
- Oh, god! Contraction!
- You're seven months pregnant.

3
00:00:08,006 --> 00:00:09,206
You're not contracting.
Please go to the hospital.

4
00:00:09,241 --> 00:00:10,675
You're going to need to go on bed rest

5
00:00:10,709 --> 00:00:12,276
Until the baby's full-term.

6
00:00:12,311 --> 00:00:14,378
I don't exactly have insurance right now.

7
00:00:14,413 --> 00:00:15,479
I'll figure out something.

8
00:00:15,514 --> 00:00:16,981
I got a business opportunity

9
00:00:17,015 --> 00:00:18,115
That really could make you a rich man.

10
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,217
- Nice.
- Yeah.

11
00:00:20,252 --> 00:00:22,286
I thought he was the one.

12
00:00:22,321 --> 00:00:23,654
I know, sweetie.

13
00:00:23,689 --> 00:00:26,691
I'm sorry, babe. - Do your thg, skeeter.

14
00:00:26,725 --> 00:00:28,192
That's pretty great.

15
00:00:28,226 --> 00:00:30,928
Texas forever.

16
00:00:31,963 --> 00:00:33,464
I think either one of
them would be nice, hon.

17
00:00:34,198 --> 00:00:35,265
This one still has a tag on it.
Might as well wear that one.

18
00:00:35,299 --> 00:00:36,600
It's brand-new.

19
00:00:36,634 --> 00:00:38,035
Honey, you know you've got
to put your toiletries

20
00:00:38,069 --> 00:00:40,604
Into the plastic travel bag. These are ugly.

21
00:00:40,638 --> 00:00:41,705
I'm not bringing those. - Don't take those.

22
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:42,839
Have you seen my bright blue shirt?

23
00:00:42,874 --> 00:00:44,841
Gracie doesn't have any pants.

24
00:00:44,876 --> 00:00:46,109
It's in with the dry cleaning.
Let me get it.

25
00:00:46,144 --> 00:00:47,377
But now get that stuff together.
We've got to go.

26
00:00:47,412 --> 00:00:48,512
Do you know where gracie's pants are?

27
00:00:48,546 --> 00:00:49,713
We've got less than a half an hour.

28
00:00:49,747 --> 00:00:50,714
Do you know where fracie's pants are?

29
00:00:50,748 --> 00:00:51,715
Hi, sweet angel.

30
00:00:51,749 --> 00:00:52,916
They're in the bottom drawer.

31
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:53,917
You're gonna help your
daddy find your pants.

32
00:00:53,951 --> 00:00:55,318
The bottom drawer, sweetie.

33
00:00:55,353 --> 00:00:56,853
You realize none of my
outfits are gonna work

34
00:00:56,888 --> 00:00:57,854
Unless I have that shirt.

35
00:00:57,889 --> 00:00:59,556
I'm getting it right now.

36
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:00,924
They're not in the bottom drawer.

37
00:01:00,958 --> 00:01:03,026
Well, if not, then check in the dryer.

38
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:04,561
Come on. Bring your spaceman.

39
00:01:04,595 --> 00:01:05,762
I know. We got to get your pants on.

40
00:01:05,797 --> 00:01:06,763
Mom, every outfit you packed

41
00:01:06,798 --> 00:01:07,998
I look like a realtor in.

42
00:01:08,032 --> 00:01:09,366
All right now. Hey, y'all need to pack up...

43
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,667
Honey, you're gonna look
amazing and beautiful

44
00:01:10,702 --> 00:01:11,735
For your interviews. - And let's get going.

45
00:01:11,769 --> 00:01:12,969
You give 'em hell up there,

46
00:01:13,004 --> 00:01:14,271
You understand me? - See.
You found the pants.

47
00:01:14,305 --> 00:01:15,872
That's great. - All right?

48
00:01:15,907 --> 00:01:17,874
All right, time to go.
You were five minutes late

49
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:18,942
Five minutes ago. - Bye, dad.

50
00:01:18,976 --> 00:01:20,010
- Good
-bye.

51
00:01:20,044 --> 00:01:21,344
You're gonna be great for your daddy.

52
00:01:21,379 --> 00:01:23,513
Oh, shoot, I got to grab my briefcase.

53
00:01:23,548 --> 00:01:25,549
Andnot that anybody cares we have

54
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:28,584
The league's two last-place teams facing off

55
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:30,686
This Friday-- the east dillon lions

56
00:01:30,721 --> 00:01:33,089
Versus the campo park timberwolves.

57
00:01:33,123 --> 00:01:35,691
Folks, I don't mean to be crude,

58
00:01:35,726 --> 00:01:36,759
But I understand that this game

59
00:01:36,793 --> 00:01:38,461
Has unofficially been called

60
00:01:38,495 --> 00:01:40,262
The toilet bowl.

61
00:01:40,297 --> 00:01:41,363
If you're coach taylor,

62
00:01:41,398 --> 00:01:42,531
You got to see this game

63
00:01:42,566 --> 00:01:44,934
As a singular opportunity

64
00:01:44,968 --> 00:01:47,837
To get a "w" on the books this season.

65
00:02:00,818 --> 00:02:03,387
Hey, ma, do I have a follo
w-up with the doctor?

66
00:02:04,122 --> 00:02:05,789
He said he didn't need to see you again

67
00:02:05,824 --> 00:02:08,358
Unless it's still hurting
in a couple of weeks.

68
00:02:08,393 --> 00:02:09,993
It's doing good, right?

69
00:02:10,028 --> 00:02:11,995
I mean, you've been going
to practice and everything.

70
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,097
Yeah. No, I'm good.

71
00:02:14,132 --> 00:02:17,234
I've been driving by this property and...

72
00:02:17,268 --> 00:02:18,368
yeah.

73
00:02:18,403 --> 00:02:20,003
Wow.

74
00:02:20,038 --> 00:02:23,540
It doesn't have a price on there,

75
00:02:23,575 --> 00:02:25,809
And I was just... - Yeah. A steal.

76
00:02:25,844 --> 00:02:27,344
$85,000.

77
00:02:27,378 --> 00:02:31,515
$75,000 if you could pay half
the purchasing price up front.

78
00:02:31,549 --> 00:02:33,016
Might that be an option?

79
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,621
Um...

80
00:02:46,231 --> 00:02:48,899
Hey, yeah, I know that we
hang out all the time--

81
00:02:48,933 --> 00:02:51,201
Exactly. So why we got to call it a date?

82
00:02:51,236 --> 00:02:53,036
Because there's a very distinct difference

83
00:02:53,071 --> 00:02:55,906
In just hanging out and an actual date.

84
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,209
I would be wearing a nice button-up shirt.

85
00:02:59,244 --> 00:03:01,812
And you would probably be wearing,
like, a nice skirt

86
00:03:01,846 --> 00:03:02,813
Or something like that. - Yeah.

87
00:03:02,847 --> 00:03:03,914
And it would be nighttime.

88
00:03:03,948 --> 00:03:05,549
When you say a nice shirt, though,

89
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:07,885
You don't mean the one
with the periodic table.

90
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:09,853
I have other really nice shirts.

91
00:03:09,888 --> 00:03:12,022
I have a bunch of really nice shirts.

92
00:03:12,056 --> 00:03:15,926
Yeah, um, I have Wednesday night off.

93
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,694
- Perfect.
- So Wednesday night?

94
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:18,862
Wednes--I love wednesdays.

95
00:03:18,897 --> 00:03:19,863
Yeah. - Okay.

96
00:03:19,898 --> 00:03:20,864
- Great.
- All right.

97
00:03:20,899 --> 00:03:22,165
- Good night.
- Cool.

98
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,368
Okay.

99
00:03:31,876 --> 00:03:34,044
Full-pad Monday. Everyone ought to be happy.

100
00:03:34,078 --> 00:03:35,345
You know what, it doesn't matter

101
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,581
Whether you win or lose,

102
00:03:37,615 --> 00:03:39,883
It's how you plaz the gam
e- who's heard that before?

103
00:03:39,918 --> 00:03:42,686
Well, that doesn't apply
to this team anymore.

104
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,887
Listen to me.

105
00:03:43,922 --> 00:03:45,522
Individually, we ought to be damn proud

106
00:03:45,557 --> 00:03:46,723
Of where we come from

107
00:03:46,758 --> 00:03:48,091
And where we are right now.

108
00:03:48,126 --> 00:03:49,726
Collectively, I think we've got

109
00:03:49,761 --> 00:03:52,429
A hell of a football team here.

110
00:03:52,463 --> 00:03:53,797
But we're not scrappers anymore.

111
00:03:53,831 --> 00:03:56,400
We're lions.

112
00:03:56,434 --> 00:03:59,970
And this is our time.

113
00:04:00,004 --> 00:04:02,906
This is your time.

114
00:04:02,941 --> 00:04:05,108
We got a week for this game coming up.

115
00:04:05,143 --> 00:04:06,777
I want you to know I'm proud

116
00:04:06,811 --> 00:04:07,811
To take the field with you.

117
00:04:09,347 --> 00:04:11,081
Let's practice.

118
00:04:17,689 --> 00:04:20,691
Let's go!

119
00:04:30,101 --> 00:04:32,102
What's going on?

120
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:50,187
* *

121
00:05:29,527 --> 00:05:37,534
* *

122
00:06:06,698 --> 00:06:08,865
So we have a fabulous contradiction here.

123
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,600
Chaucer is the founder

124
00:06:10,635 --> 00:06:11,902
Of modern english poetry,

125
00:06:11,936 --> 00:06:14,504
But he also uses words

126
00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:16,640
Like "ass" and "fart."

127
00:06:16,674 --> 00:06:20,711
So what does chaucer's very deliberate use

128
00:06:20,745 --> 00:06:21,845
Of language tell us?

129
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:24,514
Anyone?

130
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:29,586
Someone. Come on, really.

131
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,955
Yes, ma'am?

132
00:06:31,989 --> 00:06:33,390
Do you want to answer?

133
00:06:33,424 --> 00:06:35,225
Oh, no, I'm just observing.

134
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:36,393
Oh, no, that's okay.

135
00:06:36,427 --> 00:06:37,828
It seems you have a thought.

136
00:06:37,862 --> 00:06:39,362
Please, share.

137
00:06:39,397 --> 00:06:43,900
Oh, well, would it have
to do with the context?

138
00:06:43,935 --> 00:06:46,503
You know, who's speaking?

139
00:06:46,537 --> 00:06:48,238
Exactly.

140
00:06:48,272 --> 00:06:50,474
- - context. Who's speaking.

141
00:06:50,508 --> 00:06:52,642
Think about the knight's tale.

142
00:06:52,677 --> 00:06:53,977
- Mm
-hmm.

143
00:06:54,011 --> 00:06:55,712
A story of romantic love...

144
00:06:57,915 --> 00:06:59,583
To the middle!

145
00:07:01,219 --> 00:07:02,419
Whoo!

146
00:07:02,453 --> 00:07:04,020
Let's see you throw it like that

147
00:07:04,055 --> 00:07:06,757
Without tipping off the
safety with your shoulders.

148
00:07:09,227 --> 00:07:10,660
All right, looking good.

149
00:07:10,695 --> 00:07:11,928
Looking good!

150
00:07:14,632 --> 00:07:17,434
Yeah!

151
00:07:17,468 --> 00:07:18,769
- Let's blitz.
- Here we go.

152
00:07:18,803 --> 00:07:20,537
Hit to hurt, gentlemen. Let's go.

153
00:07:21,973 --> 00:07:25,075
Down the field. That's it, that's it.

154
00:07:27,612 --> 00:07:31,681
Fours, come here.

155
00:07:31,716 --> 00:07:33,850
You all right?

156
00:07:33,885 --> 00:07:34,951
- Yeah.
- You sure?

157
00:07:34,986 --> 00:07:36,219
- Mm-hmm.
- All right, let's go.

158
00:07:38,923 --> 00:07:41,124
Grab the ball, luke. Here we go.

159
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,365
Whoo!

160
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:50,901
Look what the cat drug in.

161
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:54,104
Ain't got any need for a toilet, do you?

162
00:07:54,138 --> 00:07:55,705
No, I don't.

163
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,641
I've never heard such malarkey
in my life. Hey, eric.

164
00:07:57,675 --> 00:07:59,576
- Good to see you.
- You too.

165
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:02,045
joe, keep the elbow up.

166
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:05,115
Toilet bowl, god help us.

167
00:08:05,149 --> 00:08:08,051
I just want to tell you that I...

168
00:08:08,085 --> 00:08:10,620
I used to be something

169
00:08:10,655 --> 00:08:12,923
For the dillon panthers.

170
00:08:12,957 --> 00:08:15,659
And I want to be that way here.

171
00:08:15,693 --> 00:08:17,360
I can help you.

172
00:08:17,395 --> 00:08:18,562
I'm gonna do that.

173
00:08:18,596 --> 00:08:20,564
I just want to let you know that.

174
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:24,167
All right.

175
00:08:28,206 --> 00:08:29,306
keep your hands--

176
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,740
No, no, put it back.

177
00:08:30,775 --> 00:08:33,410
darius!

178
00:08:33,444 --> 00:08:35,111
darius! Caleb!

179
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,585
Let go!

180
00:08:41,619 --> 00:08:43,753
What's up? Look, look, look, look.

181
00:08:43,788 --> 00:08:45,322
We're gonna run a pos
t-route with the sunflower seeds.

182
00:08:45,356 --> 00:08:48,491
Go, go, go. - Look at this.

183
00:08:48,526 --> 00:08:50,594
Are you seriously teaching
them to throw food in a--

184
00:08:50,628 --> 00:08:52,362
Oh, you can't teach that.
That was a great job.

185
00:08:52,396 --> 00:08:53,630
What's wrong with you?

186
00:08:53,664 --> 00:08:54,764
- That's talent.
- Hey.

187
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:55,932
Look at all you boys.

188
00:08:55,967 --> 00:08:57,434
I haven't seen you in such a long time.

189
00:08:57,468 --> 00:08:58,702
You've grown.

190
00:08:58,736 --> 00:09:00,370
Darius, did anybody tell you you look

191
00:09:00,404 --> 00:09:01,671
More and more like your daddy?

192
00:09:01,706 --> 00:09:02,672
Yes, ma'am.

193
00:09:02,707 --> 00:09:04,274
I bet they do.

194
00:09:04,308 --> 00:09:05,508
You know, I tell you what,

195
00:09:05,543 --> 00:09:06,643
I'm cooking dinner next week,

196
00:09:06,677 --> 00:09:08,078
And I want you to be there.

197
00:09:10,014 --> 00:09:10,981
- Me?
- Yup.

198
00:09:11,015 --> 00:09:12,949
Oh, no, I wouldn't want

199
00:09:12,984 --> 00:09:14,117
To impose on...

200
00:09:14,151 --> 00:09:15,385
No, no, no, you're not imposing.

201
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:17,053
I'm gonna cook for us,

202
00:09:17,088 --> 00:09:18,655
And I expect you to be there, okay?

203
00:09:18,689 --> 00:09:19,823
Final answer.

204
00:09:19,857 --> 00:09:22,058
Hey, you boys be good now.

205
00:09:22,093 --> 00:09:23,960
Listen to what she tells you to do, okay?

206
00:09:23,995 --> 00:09:25,195
Yes, ma'am.

207
00:09:25,229 --> 00:09:27,664
I'll see you. Come on, baby. Come on.

208
00:09:27,698 --> 00:09:29,399
Keep those.

209
00:09:29,433 --> 00:09:30,533
Let 'em have the pancakes.

210
00:09:30,568 --> 00:09:31,701
Can I get the pancakes, please?

211
00:09:31,736 --> 00:09:32,736
- No, you can't.
- Let 'em.

212
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:34,304
Stop. You hush.

213
00:09:37,174 --> 00:09:39,276
I mean, honestly, before you
were a guidance counselor,

214
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,343
I don't think  got any applications

215
00:09:40,378 --> 00:09:41,678
From your district.

216
00:09:41,712 --> 00:09:43,246
Well, you know, I think once y'all came down

217
00:09:43,281 --> 00:09:45,282
To the fair, it just put
a face to the school

218
00:09:45,316 --> 00:09:46,983
And let the kids realize

219
00:09:47,018 --> 00:09:49,419
It's not so far away,

220
00:09:49,453 --> 00:09:50,620
And it's a real opportunity for 'em.

221
00:09:50,655 --> 00:09:51,788
Well, I'm just so glad you came up to b.C.

222
00:09:51,822 --> 00:09:53,123
We are too.

223
00:09:53,157 --> 00:09:54,858
Julie, how do you like it so far?

224
00:09:54,892 --> 00:09:57,727
Um, it looks exactly like the brochure.

225
00:09:57,762 --> 00:09:58,929
Beautiful.

226
00:09:58,963 --> 00:10:00,830
Did you get a chance to
sit in on any classes?

227
00:10:00,865 --> 00:10:02,799
Yeah, an english class.

228
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,334
Oh, great. How was it?

229
00:10:04,368 --> 00:10:05,969
It was good.

230
00:10:06,003 --> 00:10:06,970
It was great.

231
00:10:07,004 --> 00:10:08,138
We had so much fun.

232
00:10:08,172 --> 00:10:09,606
It was professor paulson's class.

233
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,007
Oh, vanessa.

234
00:10:11,042 --> 00:10:13,276
Her class is like being at
some fabulous dinner party.

235
00:10:13,311 --> 00:10:15,312
<i>- It made me want to go
get the canterbury tales,</i>

236
00:10:15,346 --> 00:10:17,380
Just read it for fun all over again.

237
00:10:17,415 --> 00:10:19,015
- Mm-hmm.
- Jules loves to read too,

238
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,183
Don't you, honey?

239
00:10:20,217 --> 00:10:22,185
I think she got that from me.

240
00:10:22,219 --> 00:10:23,887
This place is so gorgeous.

241
00:10:23,921 --> 00:10:26,790
You have a big game coming up this weekend.

242
00:10:26,824 --> 00:10:28,024
What do you have to say about it?

243
00:10:30,594 --> 00:10:31,861
All right.

244
00:10:34,865 --> 00:10:37,334
Yeah.

245
00:10:37,368 --> 00:10:39,636
Some chick named mindy's
on the phone for you,

246
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,937
And she sounds really crazy,

247
00:10:40,972 --> 00:10:42,205
So do you want me to just blow her off?

248
00:10:42,239 --> 00:10:43,406
No.

249
00:10:43,441 --> 00:10:45,709
Hey, skeeter.

250
00:10:45,743 --> 00:10:47,711
Hi. - Mins.

251
00:10:47,745 --> 00:10:50,313
Hey, tim, I can't get a hold of billy,

252
00:10:50,348 --> 00:10:51,414
And the toilet's backed up,

253
00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:53,249
And I need you to get over here.

254
00:10:53,284 --> 00:10:55,885
Um, see, I've had a few too many,

255
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,420
So I can't drive.

256
00:10:57,455 --> 00:10:59,889
Actually, this isn't about you
and your drinking problem.

257
00:10:59,924 --> 00:11:01,091
It's about me and my baby,

258
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:02,225
And the toilet is toxic.

259
00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:03,927
And I pee every five minutes.

260
00:11:03,961 --> 00:11:04,995
And I don't know where your brother is,

261
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:06,396
And I really need you to be here.

262
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,064
So go in the bathtub.

263
00:11:08,099 --> 00:11:09,499
I'm not gonna go in the bathtub!

264
00:11:09,533 --> 00:11:11,868
I am on bed rest. Get your ass over here!

265
00:11:16,774 --> 00:11:18,742
Can you drive stick?

266
00:11:20,611 --> 00:11:23,213
Remember, the clutch is
your best friend, okay?

267
00:11:23,247 --> 00:11:26,116
I'm not really sure what
you mean when you say that.

268
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,351
Just let--

269
00:11:28,386 --> 00:11:30,520
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

270
00:11:30,554 --> 00:11:35,191
I don't have air bags, by the way.

271
00:11:35,226 --> 00:11:37,961
Relax. Relax.

272
00:11:39,864 --> 00:11:41,264
So why were you in a suit today?

273
00:11:41,298 --> 00:11:46,269
Oh, that's a good question.

274
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,271
Some guys aren't meant to be in a suit,

275
00:11:48,305 --> 00:11:51,674
And some guys are.

276
00:11:55,046 --> 00:11:57,447
It's green.

277
00:11:57,481 --> 00:11:59,282
The light's green. Here we go.

278
00:12:00,785 --> 00:12:02,052
Wrench me.

279
00:12:02,086 --> 00:12:04,387
- Ew.
- Where is billy anyways?

280
00:12:04,422 --> 00:12:07,157
Doing some big job down at the rig.

281
00:12:07,191 --> 00:12:08,425
This late?

282
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:10,760
You didn't know that?

283
00:12:10,795 --> 00:12:13,496
Yeah, I knew that.

284
00:12:15,633 --> 00:12:18,068
He's been working a lot of nights lately.

285
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:20,703
Yeah, well, it's getting busy, min,

286
00:12:20,738 --> 00:12:21,805
Which is a good thing.

287
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,540
It's not a big deal, right?

288
00:12:23,574 --> 00:12:24,541
What do you mean?

289
00:12:24,575 --> 00:12:27,710
Like, if I call him,

290
00:12:27,745 --> 00:12:31,081
And he's all distracted,
and he's tired all the time,

291
00:12:31,115 --> 00:12:35,051
And if I walk into a room
and he's on the phone,

292
00:12:35,086 --> 00:12:37,720
Then he hangs up really quickly?

293
00:12:37,755 --> 00:12:41,991
Mins, what you're saying is not happening.

294
00:12:42,026 --> 00:12:44,160
He is having an affair, isn't he?

295
00:12:44,195 --> 00:12:45,762
No, he's not.

296
00:12:45,796 --> 00:12:47,263
I don't even want to know.

297
00:12:47,298 --> 00:12:48,398
That's the sad part.

298
00:12:48,432 --> 00:12:49,399
How pathetic am I?

299
00:12:49,433 --> 00:12:50,567
I don't even want to know

300
00:12:50,601 --> 00:12:51,701
If my husband's cheating on me

301
00:12:51,735 --> 00:12:52,969
Because I'm a total mess.

302
00:13:03,481 --> 00:13:05,181
Yeah, I mean, this is an emerging team.

303
00:13:05,216 --> 00:13:08,485
Equals emerging opportunity.

304
00:13:17,962 --> 00:13:19,129
- Oh, no, no.
- He thinks you want free time.

305
00:13:19,163 --> 00:13:21,064
I understand. I'm a businessman.

306
00:13:21,098 --> 00:13:23,133
I understand that.

307
00:13:23,167 --> 00:13:24,534
This is a new demographic for you--

308
00:13:24,568 --> 00:13:25,735
Football.

309
00:13:25,769 --> 00:13:27,604
- Football.
- American football, yeah.

310
00:13:31,542 --> 00:13:33,076
- No, no, I understood that.
- Buddy.

311
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,477
American football.

312
00:13:34,512 --> 00:13:35,512
And I understand you.

313
00:13:35,546 --> 00:13:38,081
<i>- Uno momento. Yeah, what?</i>

314
00:13:38,115 --> 00:13:39,782
You think this is really necessary?

315
00:13:39,817 --> 00:13:41,618
If they want to talk trash about us,
the hell with them.

316
00:13:41,652 --> 00:13:43,119
Let's just get out of here. I'm an investor.

317
00:13:43,154 --> 00:13:44,354
They understand that.

318
00:13:44,388 --> 00:13:47,724
This is a chance for us to have a voice.

319
00:13:47,758 --> 00:13:49,259
We can stop all the trash talk

320
00:13:49,293 --> 00:13:51,528
That's going on. This can make a difference.

321
00:13:51,562 --> 00:13:53,163
Do you think we can do this
within another five minutes?

322
00:13:53,197 --> 00:13:54,264
Yes.

323
00:13:54,298 --> 00:13:56,266
Just...Keep going.

324
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,300
<i>- Senor. - Yes.</i>

325
00:13:57,334 --> 00:13:58,635
Yes.

326
00:13:58,669 --> 00:14:01,104
You say you want english
on a spanish station?

327
00:14:01,138 --> 00:14:02,338
Just--just for the football games.

328
00:14:04,542 --> 00:14:06,376
What the hell you doing?

329
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:09,212
Mornin'.

330
00:14:09,246 --> 00:14:11,014
Yeah, morning.

331
00:14:11,048 --> 00:14:12,182
You can be honest with me, man.

332
00:14:12,216 --> 00:14:14,684
I'm just-- are you messing around on mindy?

333
00:14:16,453 --> 00:14:19,822
No. No.

334
00:14:19,857 --> 00:14:21,558
'cause I know you've been working late

335
00:14:21,592 --> 00:14:23,293
And all that kind of stuff,
and I was over there,

336
00:14:23,327 --> 00:14:25,061
And she's all worried and stressed out.

337
00:14:25,095 --> 00:14:26,262
And maybe-- - I'm not cheating on mindy.

338
00:14:26,297 --> 00:14:27,463
All right?

339
00:14:27,498 --> 00:14:29,999
- What's all this late
-night stuff then?

340
00:14:30,034 --> 00:14:34,537
Just doing a little afte
r-hours work, that's all.

341
00:14:34,572 --> 00:14:37,006
- What kind of after
-hours work?

342
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,342
You know, it's the kind of after-hours work

343
00:14:39,376 --> 00:14:41,144
That you can't really do in the daytime.

344
00:14:41,178 --> 00:14:44,647
You get it? - No, billy, I don't get it.

345
00:14:44,682 --> 00:14:46,449
That's why I'm asking. What do you mean?

346
00:14:46,483 --> 00:14:48,651
After-hours-- - okay.

347
00:14:48,686 --> 00:14:50,987
A couple guys came to me a couple weeks ago,

348
00:14:51,021 --> 00:14:54,057
And they gave me a little proposition, and--

349
00:14:54,091 --> 00:14:56,826
What kind of proposition?

350
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,662
Once or twice a week,
they come by with a car,

351
00:14:59,697 --> 00:15:01,698
And I break it down to its component parts.

352
00:15:01,732 --> 00:15:05,068
They need it turned around in a quick time,

353
00:15:05,102 --> 00:15:06,836
And they pay really well... - Chop shop.

354
00:15:10,841 --> 00:15:13,476
That's the stupidest...

355
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,511
Yeah, well, it's a plan, tim.

356
00:15:15,546 --> 00:15:16,512
You got a better plan?

357
00:15:16,547 --> 00:15:19,048
Yeah, billy.

358
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:20,216
We had a plan.

359
00:15:20,251 --> 00:15:22,151
I mean, we just had a party here

360
00:15:22,186 --> 00:15:24,354
And raised buckets of money.
Buckets of money?

361
00:15:24,388 --> 00:15:25,355
Where's all that money then, billy?

362
00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:26,489
Buckets of money. You want to know

363
00:15:26,523 --> 00:15:27,523
Where that money is, tim? - Yeah, I do.

364
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,962
One meeting with a specialist.

365
00:15:28,996 --> 00:15:30,396
That money's gone.

366
00:15:30,431 --> 00:15:32,031
You got any other plans, tell me about 'em.

367
00:15:32,066 --> 00:15:33,032
Yeah, billy.

368
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:34,968
This.

369
00:15:35,002 --> 00:15:36,836
This was our plan, billy.

370
00:15:36,871 --> 00:15:38,838
Riggins' rigs.

371
00:15:38,873 --> 00:15:41,107
Tim, it's a temporary thing.

372
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:43,776
- Temporary thing
--you have no idea what you're risking.

373
00:15:43,811 --> 00:15:45,378
Look, nobody's getting hurt here, man.

374
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:46,779
You keep reminding me,

375
00:15:46,814 --> 00:15:48,781
Like, every week that you have a family,

376
00:15:48,816 --> 00:15:53,019
And this mechanic shop
is some dream of yours.

377
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:55,088
Tim, that's the whole
reason I'm doing this, okay?

378
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:57,357
The whole reason I'm doing
this is for my family.

379
00:15:57,391 --> 00:16:00,193
This is gonna prevent
me from going bankrupt.

380
00:16:00,227 --> 00:16:01,928
It's gonna make sure

381
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:03,897
That mindy's gonna be okay and
that my baby's gonna be okay.

382
00:16:03,931 --> 00:16:05,131
All right?

383
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:06,566
And once it's over with,

384
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,635
Everything will go back to normal.

385
00:16:08,669 --> 00:16:12,105
I can't...

386
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:22,515
oh, I love this school.

387
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:24,183
I know. It's your favorite.

388
00:16:24,218 --> 00:16:28,254
Did I ever tell you this
was my first-choice school?

389
00:16:28,289 --> 00:16:29,756
Only, like, a million times.

390
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,658
But no pressure or anything, right?

391
00:16:31,692 --> 00:16:34,761
What do you mean? Of course, no pressure.

392
00:16:37,298 --> 00:16:39,699
You'd have disowned me if I
didn't apply to this college.

393
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:42,936
What are you talking about?

394
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:46,839
You've just been staring over my shoulder,

395
00:16:46,874 --> 00:16:49,742
Looking at every syllable that
I've put into every application

396
00:16:49,777 --> 00:16:51,177
Since I started the college process.

397
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:53,646
Wait a minute. You decided
where you wanted to apply.

398
00:16:53,681 --> 00:16:54,681
I have been trying to help you

399
00:16:54,715 --> 00:16:57,450
In that process.

400
00:16:57,484 --> 00:17:00,053
But, honey, it's up to you
what school you go to.

401
00:17:00,087 --> 00:17:01,621
It's not up to me.

402
00:17:01,655 --> 00:17:02,922
All I'm trying to do

403
00:17:02,957 --> 00:17:05,191
Is--is support you as
you're making that decision,

404
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:06,926
That's all.

405
00:17:06,961 --> 00:17:09,062
You get me?

406
00:17:09,096 --> 00:17:10,763
Yeah.

407
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:11,798
You sure about that?

408
00:17:14,568 --> 00:17:16,002
Yeah.

409
00:17:18,672 --> 00:17:22,308
- * shoobie
-doo-wah *

410
00:17:22,343 --> 00:17:24,477
* shoobie-doo-wah *

411
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:27,647
* shoobie-doo-wah *

412
00:17:27,681 --> 00:17:30,149
* *

413
00:17:30,184 --> 00:17:31,284
* oh *

414
00:17:31,318 --> 00:17:33,786
* strange *-- hold on.

415
00:17:33,821 --> 00:17:35,989
* oh *

416
00:17:36,023 --> 00:17:39,225
* oh * - * feel strange *

417
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:40,660
I can't hit that note.

418
00:17:40,694 --> 00:17:42,028
I'm sorry.

419
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:43,229
Is something the matter today, landry?

420
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:44,364
No, I just couldn't hit that note,

421
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:46,099
And I got frustrated. - He got stood up.

422
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:48,801
I did not get stood up, jimmy.

423
00:17:48,836 --> 00:17:50,470
Actually, the date was rescheduled

424
00:17:50,504 --> 00:17:51,938
Because of conflicts.

425
00:17:51,972 --> 00:17:53,806
And that might be a good thing

426
00:17:53,841 --> 00:17:58,611
Because Thursday is more of,
like, a sexual night anyways.

427
00:17:58,645 --> 00:17:59,812
So we're just gonna go

428
00:17:59,847 --> 00:18:02,281
Through the whole psychoanalytic breakdown?

429
00:18:02,316 --> 00:18:04,117
No, I'm saying, by 7:00 p.M.

430
00:18:04,151 --> 00:18:07,086
On Thursday, your brain
has basically clicked in

431
00:18:07,121 --> 00:18:08,454
That it's pretty much the weekend,

432
00:18:08,489 --> 00:18:10,690
But Wednesday's closer to Monday.

433
00:18:10,724 --> 00:18:13,126
And no one's getting busy on Monday, but...

434
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,660
Get busy?

435
00:18:15,863 --> 00:18:19,032
Every now and then, people want to get busy.

436
00:18:21,902 --> 00:18:23,469
Ms. Howard, can I help you out in there?

437
00:18:23,504 --> 00:18:25,805
Oh, no, no, no, you stay put.

438
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:28,708
I know you've been working hard.

439
00:18:28,742 --> 00:18:30,376
- You need help with that?
- Oh, no, baby, I got it.

440
00:18:30,411 --> 00:18:33,346
mm. Wow.

441
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,981
So, jess, I must say bless your heart

442
00:18:35,015 --> 00:18:36,249
For joining us

443
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:37,750
'cause I ain't never seen this boy

444
00:18:37,785 --> 00:18:39,819
Wear anything but a t-shirt.

445
00:18:41,155 --> 00:18:42,422
How you been?

446
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:44,424
Oh, well, you know, I can't complain.

447
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,659
Well, you know, I lost
my job down at the hotel,

448
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:48,194
But that was because it was closing

449
00:18:48,228 --> 00:18:49,429
And whatnot, but, you know,

450
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:51,097
I'm keeping myself really busy,

451
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:53,566
So, um, I did some part-time work

452
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,202
For this cleaning company,

453
00:18:56,236 --> 00:18:58,871
And, you know, that just
really didn't pan out.

454
00:18:58,906 --> 00:19:00,673
I think it was just because of doing

455
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:02,275
The night school thing down at tech.

456
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:03,509
You know, things start changing--

457
00:19:03,544 --> 00:19:05,378
Mama, these mashed potatoes are delicious.

458
00:19:05,412 --> 00:19:06,679
- Yeah, I know, baby.
- It's good.

459
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:09,715
- So I'm planning, and...
- That's good.

460
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,852
Yeah. My aunt said to tell you hello.

461
00:19:12,886 --> 00:19:14,854
- Oh.
- She's working down at this--

462
00:19:14,888 --> 00:19:16,456
For this new company-
you know what, honey?

463
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,892
Do you know how amazing you are?

464
00:19:19,927 --> 00:19:21,394
I mean, do you know how amazing you are?

465
00:19:21,428 --> 00:19:24,797
'cause, when you were a little girl,

466
00:19:24,832 --> 00:19:29,168
I mean, this light would
just shine through you.

467
00:19:29,203 --> 00:19:30,536
And--and now look at you.

468
00:19:30,571 --> 00:19:33,773
You've become a beautiful young woman.

469
00:19:33,807 --> 00:19:37,076
- Thank you.
- Vincent, isn't she beautiful?

470
00:19:37,111 --> 00:19:38,711
- - I mean, look at her.

471
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:40,012
Isn't she beautiful?

472
00:19:40,047 --> 00:19:42,081
- Oh, stop it.
- She's gorgeous.

473
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:46,619
Mm. Yeah.

474
00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:49,589
Coach, you know you doomed,

475
00:19:49,623 --> 00:19:51,624
Unless you can come up with
some kind opassing game.

476
00:19:51,658 --> 00:19:53,526
Hey, why don't you let
coach worry about his game?

477
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:57,096
Y'all need to worry about buying
some of this radio airtime.

478
00:19:57,131 --> 00:19:58,698
You know, buddy called me the other day.

479
00:19:58,732 --> 00:20:01,534
That man is on a mission.

480
00:20:01,568 --> 00:20:05,104
The roto-rooter talk's not
exactly morale-boosting, is it?

481
00:20:05,139 --> 00:20:06,372
Who are you telling?

482
00:20:06,406 --> 00:20:08,374
I bought 60 seconds, I'm a damn preacher.

483
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:11,711
Hey, sure hope you make it
worth my while, come Friday.

484
00:20:11,745 --> 00:20:13,246
We'll do our best.

485
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,981
Hey, this is pretty good brisket here.

486
00:20:15,015 --> 00:20:17,216
Thank you. Now I can die happy.

487
00:20:17,251 --> 00:20:19,685
He's warming up to me.

488
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,958
Great. The internet's not working.

489
00:20:25,993 --> 00:20:27,293
I'm sorry, honey.

490
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:30,229
Want to call downstairs?

491
00:20:30,264 --> 00:20:33,966
No.

492
00:20:34,001 --> 00:20:36,035
Jules.

493
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:39,071
You all right, honey?

494
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:47,046
I know I should be excited about this trip,

495
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,582
And I know that we've been planning it

496
00:20:49,616 --> 00:20:53,553
For a really long time, and it's...

497
00:20:53,587 --> 00:20:56,556
Everything's just-- just happening so fast.

498
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:59,559
I know. I know it seems like it.

499
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:02,361
I know I'm letting yo.

500
00:21:02,396 --> 00:21:04,197
- Hey, huh
-uh.

501
00:21:04,231 --> 00:21:07,767
No, ma'am. Don't go there.

502
00:21:07,801 --> 00:21:10,102
How could you be letting me down?

503
00:21:10,137 --> 00:21:12,305
I feel like such a stupid mess.

504
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:14,740
Like, hi, here I am. I got dumped.

505
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:16,442
And I'm hanging out at
all these universities

506
00:21:16,476 --> 00:21:17,810
Where I don't belong.

507
00:21:17,844 --> 00:21:19,245
Of course you do.

508
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,047
You belong anywhere you want.

509
00:21:21,081 --> 00:21:22,748
I don't know. It's like,
all these interviews,

510
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:25,785
It's like... I'm expected to recite

511
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:27,019
All these factoids about myself

512
00:21:27,054 --> 00:21:28,321
And tell them how perfect I am

513
00:21:28,355 --> 00:21:30,723
And why I'd be a good student,

514
00:21:30,757 --> 00:21:32,258
And it's just...

515
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:35,661
It just seems fake.

516
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:42,835
Well, I'll tell you what.

517
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:44,237
The only thing you need to do

518
00:21:44,271 --> 00:21:48,608
In all these interviews
is go in and just be you.

519
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:53,980
Just, you know,
look at this as an opportunity.

520
00:21:54,014 --> 00:21:57,116
This is an opportunity for your future.

521
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:00,119
It's exciting.

522
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:04,991
I'm gonna go take a shower.

523
00:22:18,405 --> 00:22:19,472
- Yo.
- What's up, man?

524
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:21,274
- What up, c?
- Chillin'.

525
00:22:21,308 --> 00:22:23,042
Another day.

526
00:22:23,076 --> 00:22:26,445
I know you hungry.
Go ahead and eat something.

527
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,382
What's up?

528
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:31,384
Getting kind of boring stealing
these cars without you.

529
00:22:31,418 --> 00:22:34,020
Need my road dawg.

530
00:22:34,054 --> 00:22:36,522
I can't, man.

531
00:22:36,556 --> 00:22:38,424
I wish I could, but, you know,

532
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:39,625
Gotta study these plays, you know.

533
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,960
Right. Right. Plays.

534
00:22:40,994 --> 00:22:42,295
Plays. Yo.

535
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:47,166
You know, ty and some of his boys

536
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,135
Are gonna be down at the
park hooping later, man.

537
00:22:49,169 --> 00:22:50,770
You should definitely roll.
We could take 'em.

538
00:22:50,804 --> 00:22:52,371
I mean, you ain't that good,

539
00:22:52,406 --> 00:22:53,906
But, you know, you got me on your team,

540
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,041
So we solid.

541
00:22:55,075 --> 00:22:56,042
Yeah, bro.

542
00:22:56,076 --> 00:22:58,044
Can't do it.

543
00:22:58,078 --> 00:22:59,645
Practice, you know.

544
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,447
Coach is on my butt about it, so...

545
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:03,849
Coach come first, huh?

546
00:23:05,419 --> 00:23:06,819
All right.

547
00:23:06,853 --> 00:23:08,454
It's not even like that, man.

548
00:23:08,488 --> 00:23:09,955
Listen, look, we gonna be hanging

549
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,791
Real soon.

550
00:23:11,825 --> 00:23:13,826
I just can't get caught up, you know.

551
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,395
My p.O., you know how it is.

552
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:18,864
Yeah, I know how it is, man.

553
00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:20,666
All right.

554
00:23:27,374 --> 00:23:30,910
Okay, so when you walk in,
you want to have a presence.

555
00:23:30,944 --> 00:23:32,845
So smile-- are you paying attention?

556
00:23:32,879 --> 00:23:35,047
- Yeah.
- Okay. Walk tall.

557
00:23:35,082 --> 00:23:37,249
Come in. Sit.

558
00:23:39,686 --> 00:23:41,153
With your shoulders pulled back,

559
00:23:41,188 --> 00:23:43,222
Like there's a beam of energy
coming out of your chest.

560
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:46,025
I don't think I'm trying
to be a superhero here.

561
00:23:46,059 --> 00:23:47,259
I just want a job.

562
00:23:47,294 --> 00:23:48,928
okay, now, get up,

563
00:23:48,962 --> 00:23:50,429
And let's do it from the beginning.

564
00:23:50,464 --> 00:23:53,566
Oh. It's my turn.

565
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,234
Okay. You ready for this?

566
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:57,436
I am so ready. -

567
00:23:57,471 --> 00:24:00,306
- Walk tall.
- Walking tall.

568
00:24:09,716 --> 00:24:11,550
That's my resume, sir.

569
00:24:11,585 --> 00:24:14,086
So, mr. Riggins,

570
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:16,222
I understand you're applying for a job here.

571
00:24:16,256 --> 00:24:19,992
What kind of situation are you looking for?

572
00:24:20,026 --> 00:24:23,496
I'm looking for a situation
where I can achieve something,

573
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:25,197
Be proud of it,

574
00:24:25,232 --> 00:24:28,100
And do it, start to finish,

575
00:24:28,135 --> 00:24:30,436
On my own.

576
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:34,006
You know what I think?

577
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,108
What?

578
00:24:36,143 --> 00:24:37,710
I think you're a strong person,

579
00:24:37,744 --> 00:24:40,780
An honest worker,

580
00:24:40,814 --> 00:24:44,683
And I think you can grow up
to be whoever you want to be,

581
00:24:44,718 --> 00:24:46,085
Tim riggins.

582
00:24:52,459 --> 00:24:57,163
I'm guessing that's for you.

583
00:24:57,197 --> 00:24:59,331
What are you doing here?

584
00:24:59,366 --> 00:25:02,568
Just came to talk to tim riggins.

585
00:25:02,602 --> 00:25:05,404
Oh.

586
00:25:05,439 --> 00:25:07,139
- It's for you.
- Yep.

587
00:25:07,174 --> 00:25:09,241
How are you doing?

588
00:25:09,276 --> 00:25:10,810
- Fine.
- Good.

589
00:25:13,747 --> 00:25:17,483
Fours.

590
00:25:17,517 --> 00:25:18,751
What can I do you for?

591
00:25:18,785 --> 00:25:23,756
Um, I got hurt real bad at the farm.

592
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:25,991
I mean, it's like,
when I push off and when I get hit,

593
00:25:26,026 --> 00:25:29,128
It's like someone's trying to
rip my leg off with a crowbar.

594
00:25:29,162 --> 00:25:31,330
What about the meds the doc gave you?

595
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:32,865
It's like three weeks of meds.

596
00:25:32,899 --> 00:25:33,866
I went through 'em in one.

597
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:38,838
All right.

598
00:25:38,872 --> 00:25:40,673
This is what I need you to do, all right?

599
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:42,308
- Mm-hmm.
- Dr. Cooney.

600
00:25:42,342 --> 00:25:43,676
Mental note this, all right?

601
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,911
When you see him, first thing you got to do,

602
00:25:45,946 --> 00:25:47,680
Tell him how great he was at tmu.

603
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:49,882
Bring up your hip.
And then there's four questions.

604
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:51,317
One-word answers.

605
00:25:51,351 --> 00:25:56,322
- Mm-hmm.
- No, no, yes, no.

606
00:25:56,356 --> 00:25:57,623
That's it.

607
00:25:57,657 --> 00:26:00,159
All right. Okay.

608
00:26:00,193 --> 00:26:03,095
well, the joke is on you,

609
00:26:03,129 --> 00:26:06,365
Mr. Kangaroo, for my sword
was dipped in poison.

610
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:08,200
Okay. Yay! Whoo!

611
00:26:08,235 --> 00:26:09,335
Whoo!

612
00:26:09,369 --> 00:26:10,803
Yay, thanks, landry, for the story.

613
00:26:10,837 --> 00:26:12,471
Now it's bedtime.

614
00:26:12,506 --> 00:26:13,506
What?

615
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,507
Come on.

616
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:15,841
Now be careful with those swords.

617
00:26:15,876 --> 00:26:16,976
And start the--

618
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,213
You're trying to scare me.

619
00:26:21,248 --> 00:26:22,882
Aren't you gonna kiss?

620
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:24,717
- Go inside.
- No.

621
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:25,751
Start the bathwater.

622
00:26:25,785 --> 00:26:27,820
Vince is gonna kick your butt.

623
00:26:27,854 --> 00:26:29,021
He's gonna kick who's butt?

624
00:26:29,055 --> 00:26:31,023
this is gonna be fun!

625
00:26:31,057 --> 00:26:33,526
Jess likes the punter!

626
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,327
She's gonna kiss him!

627
00:26:35,362 --> 00:26:37,196
Smoochy!

628
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:39,365
What'd he say about vince?

629
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:43,202
I don't-- I don't know.

630
00:26:43,236 --> 00:26:45,104
I think they like--yeah.

631
00:26:45,138 --> 00:26:47,506
Well, either way,
I had a really good time tonight.

632
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:51,710
I did too.

633
00:26:57,017 --> 00:26:59,552
I'll see you tomorrow at school.

634
00:26:59,586 --> 00:27:01,220
- Yeah.
- Thanks for the sword.

635
00:27:01,254 --> 00:27:03,756
- Be careful.
- And for the story.

636
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,724
That--thanks.

637
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:07,026
All right.

638
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:10,429
Good night.

639
00:27:13,199 --> 00:27:15,301
Yeah.

640
00:27:18,305 --> 00:27:22,074
Well, I got a toy.

641
00:27:22,108 --> 00:27:24,877
All right, it's a vegetarian place,

642
00:27:24,911 --> 00:27:26,478
And it's around here somewhere.

643
00:27:26,513 --> 00:27:27,513
It's supposed to be great.

644
00:27:27,547 --> 00:27:29,014
I read a review about it.

645
00:27:29,049 --> 00:27:31,784
Can't we just go back
and order room service?

646
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:33,419
What are you talking about?

647
00:27:33,453 --> 00:27:35,521
This is gonna be fun.

648
00:27:35,555 --> 00:27:36,822
I just want to go back.

649
00:27:36,856 --> 00:27:38,357
Hey, hon, come here, come here,

650
00:27:38,391 --> 00:27:40,426
Come here, come here, come here, listen.

651
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,728
I know you're sad about matt leaving,

652
00:27:42,762 --> 00:27:44,363
And I am sorry for that.

653
00:27:44,397 --> 00:27:46,565
But we're here. All right?

654
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,301
This is a great opportunity for you.

655
00:27:49,336 --> 00:27:51,837
I just want to make sure you're
seeing the bigger picture.

656
00:27:51,871 --> 00:27:55,741
I don't know what that big picture is.

657
00:27:55,775 --> 00:27:58,043
It's you. It's your life.

658
00:27:58,078 --> 00:27:59,345
It's your future.

659
00:27:59,379 --> 00:28:01,447
It's getting into the school of your dreams.

660
00:28:01,481 --> 00:28:02,815
You mean the school of your dreams.

661
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:03,849
Hey.

662
00:28:03,883 --> 00:28:06,118
Stop acting like you're here

663
00:28:06,152 --> 00:28:07,386
Because of me, like I've been

664
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,388
Masterminding your
applications and all that.

665
00:28:09,422 --> 00:28:11,357
No, you've always wanted
to go to a great school

666
00:28:11,391 --> 00:28:12,691
Your whole life.

667
00:28:12,726 --> 00:28:13,959
I am just here to support you.

668
00:28:13,994 --> 00:28:15,494
You get that?

669
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:17,529
Well, I'm sorry I'm not giving
you the command performance

670
00:28:17,564 --> 00:28:18,931
That you deserve. - Well, you know what?

671
00:28:18,965 --> 00:28:20,199
You've got an opportunity tomorrow.

672
00:28:20,233 --> 00:28:22,034
And you can either show
up and be your best self,

673
00:28:23,271 --> 00:28:24,438
But if you blow it off
because of a break-up,

674
00:28:24,472 --> 00:28:25,472
You are gonna regret that.

675
00:28:25,507 --> 00:28:27,074
So what do you want me to do?

676
00:28:27,108 --> 00:28:29,009
I want you to pull it together, girl.

677
00:28:29,043 --> 00:28:30,577
Yeah, well, I'm trying to
pull it together, okay?

678
00:28:30,612 --> 00:28:33,046
- Well, try harder.
- Try harder?

679
00:28:33,081 --> 00:28:34,815
Yes.

680
00:28:37,318 --> 00:28:38,886
Thanks for your support, mom.

681
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,188
Jules, come-- jules, come here.

682
00:28:41,222 --> 00:28:43,190
Come here. Jules.

683
00:28:46,961 --> 00:28:47,928
<i>- We were assigned a
christmas memory last year,</i>

684
00:28:47,962 --> 00:28:49,463
And, after that, I started reading

685
00:28:49,497 --> 00:28:50,998
All of capote's short stories.

686
00:28:51,032 --> 00:28:52,299
They're really great.

687
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:53,534
Well, that's impressive.

688
00:28:53,568 --> 00:28:55,469
You know what I think is really amazing?

689
00:28:55,503 --> 00:28:58,172
Is that he and harper lee were best friends.

690
00:28:58,206 --> 00:29:00,541
That, in a little town, two great artists

691
00:29:00,575 --> 00:29:01,742
Found each other when they were kids.

692
00:29:01,776 --> 00:29:05,012
Hmm. I never thought of it that way.

693
00:29:05,046 --> 00:29:07,314
Now, julie,

694
00:29:07,348 --> 00:29:09,383
Is there anything else you
want to say about yourself,

695
00:29:09,417 --> 00:29:12,719
Something that we wouldn't pick
up from reading your transcript?

696
00:29:12,754 --> 00:29:15,722
Um...

697
00:29:18,026 --> 00:29:22,162
When I started high school,

698
00:29:22,197 --> 00:29:24,164
I couldn't wait to get out of dillon.

699
00:29:24,199 --> 00:29:27,701
I thought that every book I
read was like a rung on a ladder

700
00:29:27,735 --> 00:29:29,570
That I built to escape this town

701
00:29:29,604 --> 00:29:32,706
That was all about high school
football and nothing else.

702
00:29:35,977 --> 00:29:39,713
And now that I'm actually
getting close to leaving,

703
00:29:39,747 --> 00:29:42,916
I'm starting to appreciate

704
00:29:42,951 --> 00:29:47,454
That I was shaped by my town,

705
00:29:47,488 --> 00:29:53,193
That I have different viewpoint
than every other person.

706
00:29:53,228 --> 00:29:58,899
I guess what I'm trying to say is that...

707
00:29:58,933 --> 00:30:00,901
I'm surprised by how happy I am

708
00:30:00,935 --> 00:30:04,671
To be from where I'm from.

709
00:30:04,706 --> 00:30:06,506
Does that make any sense?

710
00:30:08,076 --> 00:30:10,010
Yes, it does.

711
00:30:13,314 --> 00:30:14,948
Thanks for coming in.

712
00:30:14,982 --> 00:30:16,583
Well, I appreciate you taking the meeting.

713
00:30:16,617 --> 00:30:18,251
- Absolutely.
- Great.

714
00:30:18,286 --> 00:30:20,120
So anything you want to
add before we're done?

715
00:30:20,154 --> 00:30:21,855
- Resume seems pretty up
-to-date

716
00:30:21,889 --> 00:30:24,691
And, I mean, the state
champ's on there and stuff.

717
00:30:24,726 --> 00:30:25,859
Yeah. Hey, that was impressive, man.

718
00:30:25,893 --> 00:30:27,661
I know I could really come

719
00:30:27,695 --> 00:30:30,230
Into this kind of workplace and
have a sense of achievement.

720
00:30:30,264 --> 00:30:32,466
Well, tim, I think you'd be a good fit here.

721
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,402
- Awesome. Great.
- Great.

722
00:30:35,436 --> 00:30:38,004
- Yeah.
- And so we'll be in touch.

723
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:40,307
Okay.

724
00:30:40,341 --> 00:30:41,475
You take care.

725
00:30:41,509 --> 00:30:45,045
Yeah. You too.

726
00:30:55,556 --> 00:31:01,061
- Hey.
- Hi.

727
00:31:01,095 --> 00:31:02,562
So?

728
00:31:02,597 --> 00:31:04,631
Is that you asking me how it went?

729
00:31:04,665 --> 00:31:06,366
I mean, you know,

730
00:31:06,401 --> 00:31:07,801
I'm not pressuring you.

731
00:31:07,835 --> 00:31:09,770
You tell me if you want to tell me.

732
00:31:09,804 --> 00:31:11,405
It went well.

733
00:31:11,439 --> 00:31:14,541
Good.

734
00:31:14,575 --> 00:31:18,111
Actually, it went great.

735
00:31:18,146 --> 00:31:20,614
And I went in there,
and I totally kicked ass.

736
00:31:23,684 --> 00:31:25,085
Oh.

737
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:28,855
Oh, I'm so proud of you.

738
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:30,290
But you know what, hon?

739
00:31:30,324 --> 00:31:33,126
You know I'd be proud of
you no matter what, right?

740
00:31:33,161 --> 00:31:34,261
I know.

741
00:31:34,295 --> 00:31:36,797
And this whole thing about the fact

742
00:31:36,831 --> 00:31:38,265
That I applied to this school--

743
00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:39,866
I know, I know. It's your dream.

744
00:31:39,901 --> 00:31:41,868
No, honey, honey, that's the thing.

745
00:31:41,903 --> 00:31:44,337
I got my dream.

746
00:31:44,372 --> 00:31:46,339
I went to a good school,

747
00:31:46,374 --> 00:31:47,908
I got the degree I wanted,

748
00:31:47,942 --> 00:31:50,343
I met your dad,

749
00:31:50,378 --> 00:31:52,746
And I had you.

750
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,314
You're my dream, baby.

751
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:57,717
I got what I wanted.

752
00:31:57,752 --> 00:32:00,420
I got it all.

753
00:32:02,089 --> 00:32:06,059
And now it's your job to
dream up whatever you want,

754
00:32:06,093 --> 00:32:10,497
And I will support you to the
ends of the earth to do that.

755
00:32:16,938 --> 00:32:18,338
Our plane's not till tonight.

756
00:32:18,372 --> 00:32:20,774
We could go-- go to a museum

757
00:32:20,808 --> 00:32:24,444
Or go get a hot fudge sundae and celebrate.

758
00:32:24,479 --> 00:32:29,883
Could we just go home?

759
00:32:29,917 --> 00:32:33,420
Sure we can, sweetie.

760
00:32:41,462 --> 00:32:43,830
You allergic to any medication?

761
00:32:43,865 --> 00:32:45,065
No.

762
00:32:45,099 --> 00:32:46,333
Use alcohol?

763
00:32:46,367 --> 00:32:48,068
No.

764
00:32:48,102 --> 00:32:50,804
You ever try any ove
r-the-counter medications?

765
00:32:50,838 --> 00:32:52,939
Yes.

766
00:32:52,974 --> 00:32:54,174
They do any good for the pain?

767
00:32:54,208 --> 00:32:56,476
- No.
- Hmm.

768
00:32:58,713 --> 00:33:00,947
Who's gonna win the bcs?

769
00:33:00,982 --> 00:33:02,682
Tmu, sir.

770
00:33:05,386 --> 00:33:07,287
At least your head's in the right spot.

771
00:33:07,321 --> 00:33:08,788
Here you go.

772
00:33:08,823 --> 00:33:10,156
Thank you very much.

773
00:33:10,191 --> 00:33:11,324
- Good luck tonight.
- Yes, sir.

774
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:13,226
They said I came close,

775
00:33:13,261 --> 00:33:16,162
Whatever that means.

776
00:33:16,197 --> 00:33:19,666
And they'll--they'll, of course,
keep the resume close by.

777
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,134
So you never know.

778
00:33:21,168 --> 00:33:25,405
There's no accounting for taste.

779
00:33:25,439 --> 00:33:26,940
That's what my mom always says.

780
00:33:26,974 --> 00:33:30,377
I've heard that a few times myself.

781
00:33:35,383 --> 00:33:38,018
So this is it, huh?

782
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:45,125
This is it.

783
00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:46,560
It's beautiful.

784
00:33:46,594 --> 00:33:48,395
You know what?

785
00:33:48,429 --> 00:33:51,064
I didn't want that job anyways.

786
00:33:53,501 --> 00:33:56,703
See those trees right there?

787
00:33:56,737 --> 00:33:57,904
That little ridge?

788
00:33:57,939 --> 00:33:59,406
That's where the house is gonna go.

789
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,707
And then I want that deck

790
00:34:00,741 --> 00:34:02,309
That goes all the way around.

791
00:34:02,343 --> 00:34:03,376
- A wraparound.
- Yeah.

792
00:34:03,411 --> 00:34:05,345
Maybe even a little guest house.

793
00:34:05,379 --> 00:34:06,513
You never know.

794
00:34:06,547 --> 00:34:08,114
You see the tree line right there,

795
00:34:08,149 --> 00:34:10,350
I mean, I've walked this
property a few times,

796
00:34:10,384 --> 00:34:14,654
And it goes way, way beyond that.

797
00:34:14,689 --> 00:34:16,890
It's endless.

798
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:23,063
I wanted to--

799
00:34:23,097 --> 00:34:28,268
I wanted to thank you...

800
00:34:28,302 --> 00:34:32,205
For helping me with...

801
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:35,075
The process.

802
00:34:35,109 --> 00:34:38,912
So thank you.

803
00:34:57,465 --> 00:34:59,599
I'm sorry.

804
00:35:18,653 --> 00:35:19,619
Welcome, folks, and all the fans

805
00:35:19,654 --> 00:35:20,854
Of the east dillon lions.

806
00:35:20,888 --> 00:35:23,823
We invite you tonight to the radio debut

807
00:35:23,858 --> 00:35:27,394
Of lions football on 1040 a.M., el fuego.

808
00:35:27,428 --> 00:35:29,396
Now over to my partner

809
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:31,631
And your play-by-play man willie gault.

810
00:35:31,666 --> 00:35:32,832
Thank you, buddy garrity,

811
00:35:32,867 --> 00:35:34,601
And thank you to all you fans who tuned in

812
00:35:34,635 --> 00:35:36,536
To hear a game that has been given

813
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:38,204
A very special billing--

814
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:39,406
The toilet bowl.

815
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,008
One, two, three! All: Lions!

816
00:35:42,043 --> 00:35:49,315
* *

817
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:50,583
Oh!

818
00:35:57,391 --> 00:35:59,325
Go! Go! Go!

819
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,168
There's the snap. Looking left.

820
00:36:08,202 --> 00:36:10,336
He cuts up the middle.

821
00:36:10,371 --> 00:36:12,105
Too late. Makes a move.

822
00:36:13,808 --> 00:36:16,743
Touchdown! - There we go.

823
00:36:18,746 --> 00:36:20,847
And the lions draw first blood.

824
00:36:20,881 --> 00:36:22,182
What an impressive first series

825
00:36:22,216 --> 00:36:24,384
That coach eric taylor

826
00:36:24,418 --> 00:36:26,052
Has designed here in east dillon tonight.

827
00:36:26,087 --> 00:36:27,287
Yeah!

828
00:36:27,321 --> 00:36:29,622
I tell you what, vince howard is gunned up,

829
00:36:29,657 --> 00:36:31,024
He is yoked up, and he is playing

830
00:36:31,058 --> 00:36:34,527
Like he's been playing
quarterback his whole life.

831
00:36:34,562 --> 00:36:36,396
And this touchdown was brought to you

832
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:40,233
By el amigo restaurant.

833
00:36:40,267 --> 00:36:45,872
* *

834
00:36:45,906 --> 00:36:49,109
Vince howard comes back out in the spread.

835
00:36:49,143 --> 00:36:51,745
He's got his a back setup in the slot.

836
00:36:51,779 --> 00:36:55,248
Rolling right to throw back.

837
00:36:55,282 --> 00:36:59,786
* *

838
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:03,656
Oh! Beautiful pass!

839
00:37:07,128 --> 00:37:09,562
Oh, he overthrew him. It's incomplete.

840
00:37:10,998 --> 00:37:12,265
Would you look at the gun on that kid?

841
00:37:12,299 --> 00:37:15,068
Howard has just thrown the ball

842
00:37:15,102 --> 00:37:16,102
It looks like 60 yards, willie.

843
00:37:16,137 --> 00:37:18,238
It seems like inexperience

844
00:37:18,272 --> 00:37:19,606
Finally caught up with young howard.

845
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,740
Landry!

846
00:37:20,775 --> 00:37:21,908
Field goal.

847
00:37:21,942 --> 00:37:23,576
But it's on the 25 yard line.

848
00:37:23,611 --> 00:37:25,011
Just go kick the damn thing.

849
00:37:25,045 --> 00:37:26,579
go, landry, go!

850
00:37:31,452 --> 00:37:32,952
* *

851
00:37:44,198 --> 00:37:45,598
Ladies and gentlemen,

852
00:37:45,633 --> 00:37:48,501
Landry clarke has hit a 42-yard field goal.

853
00:37:48,536 --> 00:37:50,837
East dillon lions go into halftime

854
00:37:50,871 --> 00:37:52,972
With a 17 to 7 lead.

855
00:38:13,294 --> 00:38:16,262
You scared the crap out of me.

856
00:38:16,297 --> 00:38:18,998
What's with the monkey suit?

857
00:38:31,312 --> 00:38:34,113
How much money are we talking about?

858
00:38:34,148 --> 00:38:38,718
Tim.

859
00:38:38,752 --> 00:38:41,221
I don't want you involved in this.

860
00:38:41,255 --> 00:38:42,555
How much?

861
00:38:46,527 --> 00:38:48,094
You'll make more money in two months

862
00:38:48,128 --> 00:38:49,796
Than you could in two years.

863
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:52,065
Two months?

864
00:38:52,099 --> 00:38:54,534
Two months max.

865
00:39:05,279 --> 00:39:07,313
- It's 17
-7, east dillon,

866
00:39:07,348 --> 00:39:09,549
And the way the lions
have been playing tonight,

867
00:39:09,583 --> 00:39:11,584
I hope coach taylor just lets 'em play.

868
00:39:11,619 --> 00:39:12,819
All right, go on one. Ready? All: Break.

869
00:39:12,853 --> 00:39:14,120
Howard over center.

870
00:39:14,154 --> 00:39:15,154
There's your snap.

871
00:39:15,189 --> 00:39:16,489
He's looking left.

872
00:39:16,523 --> 00:39:18,324
Under pressure, throws the ball.

873
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:19,325
Oh, it's picked off!

874
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,661
Oh, what are you doing?

875
00:39:21,695 --> 00:39:24,163
Timberwolves have it. Going the other way!

876
00:39:24,198 --> 00:39:27,500
The pack on the move.
Touchdown, timberwolves.

877
00:39:31,872 --> 00:39:33,573
You know what,

878
00:39:33,607 --> 00:39:36,009
A good quarterback's got a short memory.

879
00:39:38,245 --> 00:39:44,217
* *

880
00:39:44,251 --> 00:39:45,652
Cafferty's looking for a place to go.

881
00:39:45,686 --> 00:39:46,886
There's nowhere to run.

882
00:39:46,921 --> 00:39:49,255
And cafferty gets swarmed
by the timberwolf team.

883
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:51,925
- Come on!
- Oh, my, fumble!

884
00:39:51,959 --> 00:39:54,294
Campo picks it up.
Looks like reservations for six.

885
00:39:54,328 --> 00:39:55,695
Touchdown, timberwolves!

886
00:39:57,164 --> 00:39:59,599
Another timberwolf touchdown.

887
00:39:59,633 --> 00:40:01,034
This cannot be.

888
00:40:01,068 --> 00:40:02,435
The lions have squandered their lead.

889
00:40:02,469 --> 00:40:03,469
Now how did this happen?

890
00:40:03,504 --> 00:40:05,271
I think I'm gonna be sick, willie.

891
00:40:07,241 --> 00:40:11,878
let's go, lions, let's go!

892
00:40:11,912 --> 00:40:19,919
* *

893
00:40:44,278 --> 00:40:46,479
Hey, hey, time out. Time.

894
00:40:46,513 --> 00:40:48,748
Hey, you all right? - Yeah, I'm fine.

895
00:40:48,782 --> 00:40:50,316
You all right till next series?

896
00:40:50,351 --> 00:40:51,617
Yeah. Let's go. Yes, sir.

897
00:40:51,652 --> 00:40:52,785
- Okay.
- Let's do it.

898
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:55,488
60 seconds left in the game,

899
00:40:55,522 --> 00:40:57,590
The lions third and goal
from the two-yard line.

900
00:40:57,624 --> 00:40:58,958
Coach taylor out of time-outs.

901
00:40:59,993 --> 00:41:01,393
You know, sometimes, willie,

902
00:41:01,427 --> 00:41:03,061
There are other forces at work.

903
00:41:03,096 --> 00:41:06,398
Damn it, coach taylor
has inspired these boys,

904
00:41:06,432 --> 00:41:07,399
He's worked these boys,

905
00:41:07,433 --> 00:41:09,301
And these boys are a team.

906
00:41:09,335 --> 00:41:16,108

907
00:41:20,813 --> 00:41:21,880
Go, go, go!

908
00:41:27,487 --> 00:41:29,021
Yeah!

909
00:41:29,055 --> 00:41:31,156
The east dillon lions win! We won!

910
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,290
We won a game!

911
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,134
Yeah.

912
00:41:42,168 --> 00:41:49,374

913
00:41:53,146 --> 00:41:55,480
I got to admit,
my man's been insane tonight.

914
00:41:55,515 --> 00:41:58,183
No doubt.

915
00:42:04,524 --> 00:42:08,326
I'll see you later.

916
00:42:08,361 --> 00:42:11,363
Hey, landry! - Hey there.
