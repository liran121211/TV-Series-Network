1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:02,084
It's up for discussion
at the board meeting.

2
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:04,879
I love my job, I'm good at it,
and I'd like to keep it.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,047
I love you,

4
00:00:07,217 --> 00:00:08,758
I just think we should break up.

5
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:11,672
You're the only one who's never left me.
I'm not gonna leave you.

6
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:13,679
I'm gonna stay here. For good.

7
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,640
You're gonna go to college
and get a degree.

8
00:00:15,897 --> 00:00:16,955
Do you hear me?

9
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,143
They offered the job to Wade Aikmen.

10
00:00:20,917 --> 00:00:23,984
The board would like to offer you
the position of head coach

11
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:25,490
at East Dillon High.

12
00:00:35,145 --> 00:00:37,316
<i>I'm Sammy Meade,
and folks, let me tell you,</i>

13
00:00:37,441 --> 00:00:41,764
<i>the sky is dry, the fields are brown,
the drought is long</i>

14
00:00:41,889 --> 00:00:43,273
<i>and it has happened:</i>

15
00:00:43,603 --> 00:00:46,354
<i>this town has been divided.</i>

16
00:00:53,913 --> 00:00:54,927
Thanks, babe.

17
00:00:55,839 --> 00:00:56,843
Good luck.

18
00:00:59,501 --> 00:01:00,637
I love you.

19
00:01:31,743 --> 00:01:33,551
- Wade, listen to me!
- Buddy, I know.

20
00:02:05,276 --> 00:02:07,057
<i>¿Qué estás haciendo aquí, tú?</i>

21
00:02:07,182 --> 00:02:08,187
Sorry...

22
00:02:08,797 --> 00:02:10,177
- Coach Taylor.
- <i>¿Quién?</i>

23
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,463
Coach Taylor, football team.
Coach Taylor.

24
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:15,217
- Here, <i>no hay</i> football team.
- The new coach for the football team.

25
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:17,716
- New football team?
- That's right.

26
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:20,682
Don't kick my door, <i>por favor</i>.

27
00:02:47,264 --> 00:02:49,251
You know there's a raccoon in here?

28
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:03,015
On the ground! On your stomach!

29
00:03:03,258 --> 00:03:06,523
On your stomach! Right now!
Let's go! Buddy, it's over.

30
00:03:06,648 --> 00:03:08,187
On the ground!

31
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:13,220
Next, let's go, come on!
Name?

32
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:15,027
- Calvin.
- Take the chain off.

33
00:03:17,272 --> 00:03:18,488
Take the chain off.

34
00:03:18,784 --> 00:03:21,325
Do you see this man?
It's 18 G's right here, dawg.

35
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:25,662
Take the chain off
and you're gonna call me Coach Taylor.

36
00:03:27,171 --> 00:03:28,730
Landry, hey, what's up?

37
00:03:30,182 --> 00:03:31,201
Kenny...

38
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:33,204
Olsen, from JV.

39
00:03:33,859 --> 00:03:36,010
- What position you want to play?
- Quarterback.

40
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,889
- What are you going out for?
- Let's go, next.

41
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,346
- I'm...
- I'm going out for quarterback.

42
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:45,182
- What position you wanna play?
- You know, quarterback.

43
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,170
- Quarterback.
- Quarterback.

44
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:50,852
We found our quarterback, gentlemen!

45
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:52,213
Step off, next!

46
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:57,896
All the way up!

47
00:03:58,774 --> 00:04:00,070
All the way down!

48
00:04:32,436 --> 00:04:33,271
Listen up!

49
00:04:35,112 --> 00:04:36,942
Called you out here today
to see what we got.

50
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,321
And after 18 minutes,
I think I've seen enough.

51
00:04:43,731 --> 00:04:46,409
I want you all to go home tonight
and think long and hard...

52
00:04:47,117 --> 00:04:48,777
on how much you want this,

53
00:04:49,413 --> 00:04:50,915
on whether you want this.

54
00:04:52,306 --> 00:04:54,823
If you don't, that's fine,
there's no shame in that.

55
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:58,046
I don't want you wasting my time
and I don't wanna waste yours either.

56
00:04:59,588 --> 00:05:00,921
If you do want it,

57
00:05:01,932 --> 00:05:04,678
then be out here tomorrow morning
at 6 a.m, we'll get after it.

58
00:05:05,153 --> 00:05:08,411
But get your rest tonight, 'cause
I promise you you're gonna need that.

59
00:05:26,335 --> 00:05:27,424
Hey, Coach.

60
00:05:29,672 --> 00:05:31,935
Good, good.
Ken Shaw. 12th precinct.

61
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:34,599
Your brother used
to play ball for me?

62
00:05:34,724 --> 00:05:36,970
- Sure did. Mike Shaw.
- That's right, Mike.

63
00:05:37,095 --> 00:05:38,545
Linebacker. How's he doing?

64
00:05:38,816 --> 00:05:41,089
He's doing pretty good,
speaks very highly of you.

65
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:43,816
- He ended up playing?
- He played for a couple of years,

66
00:05:43,951 --> 00:05:46,213
but he got hurt,
so he had to step out.

67
00:05:46,338 --> 00:05:47,868
- Tell him I said hello.
- I will.

68
00:05:48,033 --> 00:05:49,355
What d'you got here?

69
00:05:50,572 --> 00:05:52,309
You've heard
of Cops 'N' Jocks, right?

70
00:05:53,075 --> 00:05:55,362
- Second chance.
- Yeah, second chance program.

71
00:05:55,487 --> 00:05:57,678
Well, we just brought this kid
in this morning.

72
00:05:57,897 --> 00:06:00,900
You know, he's a decent kid,
but he's got a record now.

73
00:06:01,068 --> 00:06:03,529
Next stop is juvie for him
and that's a bad path.

74
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:07,198
- What kind of record?
- Minor stuff, nothing major.

75
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:09,442
I'm talking about
breaking and entering...

76
00:06:09,567 --> 00:06:10,910
Did he kill anyone?

77
00:06:11,203 --> 00:06:12,433
Not animals?

78
00:06:13,691 --> 00:06:16,001
Like I said, these are
mostly non-violent offenses.

79
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:18,562
- What do you mean, mostly?
- You can help him out.

80
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:22,461
You wanna meet him?

81
00:06:23,414 --> 00:06:24,702
Since you brought him,

82
00:06:24,827 --> 00:06:26,818
- I guess I should.
- I hope so, yeah.

83
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:31,951
How you doing, son?
Coach Taylor.

84
00:06:33,069 --> 00:06:34,642
- Vince.
- Vince?

85
00:06:35,647 --> 00:06:37,061
You've ever played football?

86
00:06:37,473 --> 00:06:39,356
Yeah, all the time.
Madden.

87
00:06:39,689 --> 00:06:40,565
How's that?

88
00:06:40,998 --> 00:06:42,233
- Madden.
- Madden?

89
00:06:43,085 --> 00:06:45,341
- Madden?
- It's a video game, Coach, Madden.

90
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,119
Madden football.

91
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:49,326
You ever play any real football?

92
00:06:50,437 --> 00:06:53,077
- Threw the ball around with my friends.
- Do you like to run?

93
00:06:53,678 --> 00:06:55,872
He can run, Coach.
The boy is fast, real fast.

94
00:06:56,734 --> 00:06:58,417
- You like to hit?
- Hit what?

95
00:06:58,650 --> 00:06:59,657
People.

96
00:07:00,706 --> 00:07:01,805
I like that.

97
00:07:03,153 --> 00:07:06,591
But what would you say if I needed you
to be here tomorrow at 6 a.m. sharp?

98
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:09,976
6 a.m. sharp means 5:45.

99
00:07:13,722 --> 00:07:14,783
I'll be here.

100
00:07:16,767 --> 00:07:19,267
Friday Night Lights 4x01
- East Of Dillon -

101
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,689
Subtitles: Team Lions

102
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,318
With the participation of:

103
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:28,905
Benj!, Collioure, DarKsh, Gates44
GillesSilb, Jenn, Ju, Nam, Tactactac

104
00:08:02,212 --> 00:08:05,564
Buddy, you know those people.
You can get them to refile their papers.

105
00:08:06,175 --> 00:08:08,311
We can handle that,
that's not a big deal.

106
00:08:08,436 --> 00:08:10,989
- We can fix that...
- Gentlemen, Tami Taylor!

107
00:08:13,021 --> 00:08:14,867
Not necessary, thank you.

108
00:08:15,035 --> 00:08:16,423
Thank you very much.

109
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:20,581
We need to acknowledge the huge part
you played in this redistricting effort.

110
00:08:20,786 --> 00:08:24,309
Because of it, our athletic program
is already seeing the positive effects.

111
00:08:25,651 --> 00:08:28,605
Good, good. I hope y'all get
everything you deserve this year.

112
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:31,467
Thank you for stepping up
and doing the right thing.

113
00:08:32,537 --> 00:08:33,669
Good, good.

114
00:08:34,843 --> 00:08:37,060
Are we gonna talk about football?

115
00:08:37,185 --> 00:08:39,767
Were your ears burning,
'cause we were just talking about you?

116
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,352
Yeah, we were.

117
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,104
Talking about Friday's festivities.

118
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:45,690
We would love for you
to do the coin toss this Friday.

119
00:08:46,155 --> 00:08:49,235
The coin toss?
Ain't that Mayor Roddell's...

120
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:52,405
I'll handle Lucy. I'll handle her.
We want you.

121
00:08:53,732 --> 00:08:56,567
We think it is very important
that all of us show

122
00:08:56,943 --> 00:08:58,703
that we are all in this together.

123
00:08:59,515 --> 00:09:01,423
So, it would be an honor

124
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,499
and it would mean a lot to us

125
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:06,210
and we're thinking that maybe
you should call "heads".

126
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:13,217
We're just kidding.
You call whatever you wanna call!

127
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:17,430
You can call whatever you want
in the coin toss.

128
00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:19,890
I'm honored. Thank you.

129
00:09:20,239 --> 00:09:22,852
- Make sure you think about it.
- Okay, I'm thinking about it.

130
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:26,688
"... your thoughts are my own thoughts.
My daughter should be yours,

131
00:09:26,813 --> 00:09:28,941
"and you my son-in-law,"
so he's entreating there,

132
00:09:29,254 --> 00:09:32,227
"if you remained."
That's the difference of going home.

133
00:09:32,352 --> 00:09:34,990
Every hero has a journey.

134
00:09:35,431 --> 00:09:37,633
Early literature is obsessed
with the journey.

135
00:09:37,758 --> 00:09:39,049
Strain the hero.

136
00:09:39,174 --> 00:09:43,331
Odysseus's journey is like a process
to help him appreciate his earlier life,

137
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,061
his love, Penelope, right...

138
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:46,946
the home he left.

139
00:09:47,294 --> 00:09:50,296
So why don't we pick up then
where we left off yesterday?

140
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,620
Come on now!
Look alive, look alive!

141
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,961
That's awful!
Get 'em in a huddle, right now.

142
00:10:31,129 --> 00:10:34,010
You gotta clip your hips, right.
Push' em up, right?

143
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,132
Put your hands down on your knees.

144
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:39,001
Heads up, alright?
This is called a huddle.

145
00:10:39,217 --> 00:10:41,063
You gotta understand
what a huddle is.

146
00:10:41,213 --> 00:10:43,565
This is your quarterback here.
He's gonna tell you what to do.

147
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:46,810
Toss us the rock, man, for real.
It's boring as hell, man.

148
00:10:46,935 --> 00:10:49,605
You can have the ball
when you can actually run a play.

149
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:54,172
Alright, now knock it off.
It's called a huddle.

150
00:10:54,486 --> 00:10:56,660
It's called a rock
and it looks like I got it now.

151
00:10:57,374 --> 00:10:59,865
- You think that's funny?
- I'm just joking man.

152
00:11:03,302 --> 00:11:04,954
My bad.
Man, I was just joking.

153
00:11:05,568 --> 00:11:07,706
Somebody get somebody!
I'm sorry.

154
00:11:07,874 --> 00:11:09,160
Coach, you all right?

155
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,276
- I'm done. I'm done.
- What's wrong?

156
00:11:11,918 --> 00:11:13,932
I'm done! I'm done!

157
00:11:14,553 --> 00:11:16,917
Where you going?
Coach, where you going?

158
00:11:22,303 --> 00:11:23,103
So...

159
00:11:23,419 --> 00:11:26,510
is your focus in metal works
or electronics?

160
00:11:26,893 --> 00:11:28,384
My focus is in art.

161
00:11:29,621 --> 00:11:31,605
What kind of art
are you interested in?

162
00:11:33,852 --> 00:11:35,991
I don't know.
The kind that I do, I guess.

163
00:11:36,286 --> 00:11:39,113
Well, that's the thing.
I don't know I would call this art.

164
00:11:41,781 --> 00:11:43,297
What would you call it?

165
00:11:43,654 --> 00:11:46,078
I would call it drawing,
without a point of view.

166
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:48,559
It's not that I don't like it.

167
00:11:48,684 --> 00:11:51,625
- But it's not saying anything.
- They thought the opposite

168
00:11:51,793 --> 00:11:54,379
at the Art Institute in Chicago
when they accepted me.

169
00:11:54,611 --> 00:11:57,304
And that's a much better art school
than Dillon Tech.

170
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:59,716
Then why are you here
in Dillon Tech?

171
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:04,263
Kiddo, so do you have a plan...

172
00:12:04,497 --> 00:12:06,265
- Something?
- What do you mean?

173
00:12:06,433 --> 00:12:07,330
For life.

174
00:12:07,764 --> 00:12:08,705
For life?

175
00:12:08,986 --> 00:12:10,477
- To do...
- Riggins Riggs.

176
00:12:10,774 --> 00:12:12,341
That's your plan?

177
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,398
Awesome.

178
00:12:14,566 --> 00:12:16,980
So, where are you gonna stay?

179
00:12:17,845 --> 00:12:19,881
- What do you mean?
- Like live.

180
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:22,108
- Billy, tater me.
- In Dillon?

181
00:12:22,545 --> 00:12:24,715
- I'm gonna stay right here.
- Here?

182
00:12:26,268 --> 00:12:27,077
Here.

183
00:12:29,177 --> 00:12:31,559
That's great.
Baby, can I...

184
00:12:31,859 --> 00:12:34,335
talk to you, for a second?
Over here.

185
00:12:34,711 --> 00:12:35,600
Thanks.

186
00:12:36,747 --> 00:12:38,790
- So good.
- Yeah, it's really good.

187
00:12:40,258 --> 00:12:41,383
How are you?

188
00:12:42,701 --> 00:12:44,065
Good to see you.

189
00:12:45,408 --> 00:12:47,264
How you doing?
How's you dad?

190
00:12:47,544 --> 00:12:49,516
Gentlemen, how you doing?
How's it going?

191
00:12:49,684 --> 00:12:51,148
Same old time, you?

192
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,436
Skeletons.

193
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:55,784
I hear Wade's got a golf cart
out there, is that the case?

194
00:12:56,048 --> 00:12:58,025
The man loves his ride, he does.

195
00:12:58,193 --> 00:13:01,862
We move the ball 15 yards down field,
he drives to the next hole.

196
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:05,783
Why don't you all come on over?

197
00:13:06,636 --> 00:13:08,310
Why dontcha all come over?

198
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:10,071
That'd be nice.

199
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:12,914
I don't think
I could explain it to Susan.

200
00:13:14,317 --> 00:13:16,022
Job security and all that stuff.

201
00:13:16,844 --> 00:13:18,999
Not young enough to take pay cut.

202
00:13:19,426 --> 00:13:20,968
All those chances, you know.

203
00:13:21,093 --> 00:13:22,966
- All right.
- Ladies and gentlemen.

204
00:13:23,134 --> 00:13:25,635
- Principal Taylor.
- Hey, everybody.

205
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:29,799
Nice to see y'all.
Thanks for coming out.

206
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,427
And I just...

207
00:13:31,552 --> 00:13:33,643
I'm thrilled to welcome everybody

208
00:13:33,768 --> 00:13:36,526
to another great year
in Dillon High.

209
00:13:36,651 --> 00:13:39,270
And, before I get going
with the events tonight...

210
00:13:39,395 --> 00:13:41,568
- I wanna thank you...
- I have a question.

211
00:13:42,402 --> 00:13:45,489
- We're gonna have a Q&A at the end.
- Why is my child being forced?

212
00:13:46,147 --> 00:13:48,950
- Nobody is being forced...
- That's exactly what's happened!

213
00:13:49,992 --> 00:13:53,121
Why you making my brother
go to a different school?

214
00:13:53,963 --> 00:13:56,209
First, I'd like to clarify,
we're gonna have a Q&A...

215
00:13:56,334 --> 00:13:58,251
My parents went to this school

216
00:13:58,419 --> 00:14:00,587
before you ever heard
of Dillon High.

217
00:14:00,893 --> 00:14:02,088
Yeah, exactly.

218
00:14:02,256 --> 00:14:06,176
I wanna know why our daughter
is being sent out

219
00:14:06,344 --> 00:14:07,719
to that hellhole

220
00:14:07,887 --> 00:14:09,596
- with that element.
- First of all,

221
00:14:09,764 --> 00:14:12,933
let's not refer to East Dillon
in this way, okay?

222
00:14:13,101 --> 00:14:14,643
I do not tolerate...

223
00:14:14,811 --> 00:14:17,104
Would you say
the two schools are equal?

224
00:14:17,577 --> 00:14:19,689
- Yes, I would.
- You'd send your child there?

225
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:24,027
I would. She has been zoned
for West Dillon and she's going there.

226
00:14:24,152 --> 00:14:27,489
- Her dad works there...
- I do look at the 2 schools as equal.

227
00:14:31,878 --> 00:14:33,678
You should send her there.

228
00:14:41,012 --> 00:14:44,339
This is impossible to get anything
accomplished this way, y'all.

229
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,452
Hey, how you doin' today?

230
00:15:01,642 --> 00:15:04,297
- Haven't seen one in a while.
- Something wrong with it,

231
00:15:04,422 --> 00:15:06,596
and gotta get it repaired
if that's alright.

232
00:15:06,911 --> 00:15:08,120
I won't do it.

233
00:15:08,371 --> 00:15:09,948
- What?
- Sir, it's garbage.

234
00:15:10,256 --> 00:15:12,367
It's garbage now
and it was back in 1992.

235
00:15:12,631 --> 00:15:15,203
It wasn't purchased here.
If you think I'm gonna let

236
00:15:15,371 --> 00:15:17,425
the finest football coach
in the state of Texas

237
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,458
walk out that door with a box
of garbage, you do not know me.

238
00:15:21,843 --> 00:15:24,170
- You got a manager around here?
- Stan Traub.

239
00:15:24,518 --> 00:15:26,596
I'm a great admirer of Coach Taylor.

240
00:15:27,216 --> 00:15:28,925
Well... Thank you, Stan.

241
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:32,512
Traub... How I know that name?

242
00:15:32,886 --> 00:15:35,569
Nobeck County.
Pop Warner Coach of the Year 2005.

243
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:38,325
Second place finisher
in 2006, 7 and 8.

244
00:15:40,116 --> 00:15:42,647
I also faxed 5 or 6 of my resumes
to you at East Dillon.

245
00:15:43,494 --> 00:15:45,651
I left you messages
on the voicemail.

246
00:15:45,776 --> 00:15:46,984
Oh yeah, that's it.

247
00:15:47,445 --> 00:15:49,663
- How you'll handle South King?
- How's that?

248
00:15:49,788 --> 00:15:52,365
They run that spread,
but that QB's gonna freeze up on you

249
00:15:52,533 --> 00:15:54,417
- if you blitz...
- You had a repair guy?

250
00:15:54,542 --> 00:15:56,411
- I can help you.
- I need to get this...

251
00:15:58,441 --> 00:15:59,664
I got you covered.

252
00:16:00,069 --> 00:16:01,916
I'm the real deal. I'm good,

253
00:16:02,449 --> 00:16:04,711
I'm cheap. I'm volunteer cheap.

254
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:06,421
You will not regret this.

255
00:16:07,851 --> 00:16:09,132
I think it'll be fun.

256
00:16:09,485 --> 00:16:13,075
- It's a Panther party.
- It's not a Panther party.

257
00:16:13,664 --> 00:16:16,269
Beth is a cheerleader,
Friday is the first game.

258
00:16:16,394 --> 00:16:18,892
We can acquiesce to the fact
that it's a Panther party.

259
00:16:19,197 --> 00:16:21,414
Devin and Landry
are going to be there.

260
00:16:21,539 --> 00:16:22,941
It's like a kick-back.

261
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:25,385
Fine. You know what,
let's stay in,

262
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,569
and watch
the Deadliest Catch marathon.

263
00:16:27,694 --> 00:16:31,112
- We can get pizza after your shift.
- Fine, we'll go.

264
00:16:31,477 --> 00:16:33,573
I have to deliver a pizza right now.

265
00:16:41,827 --> 00:16:43,278
Here are your pizzas.

266
00:16:45,753 --> 00:16:48,838
So, do you make your girlfriend
deliver pizza with you all the time?

267
00:16:52,325 --> 00:16:53,426
$18.75.

268
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:57,010
It sucks you didn't go to Chicago
like you were supposed to.

269
00:16:58,104 --> 00:17:00,016
I was gonna go
after Julie this year.

270
00:17:01,664 --> 00:17:02,904
I'm just kidding.

271
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,104
Weren't these supposed
to have cinnamon sticks?

272
00:17:08,634 --> 00:17:09,968
Thanks for the tip.

273
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:11,361
Let's go! Hustle up!

274
00:17:16,461 --> 00:17:18,646
Hey, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

275
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:19,911
What are you doing?

276
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,032
What hole are you going through?
Was it 24-power?

277
00:17:22,157 --> 00:17:23,436
- 4 hole.
- The 4 hole?

278
00:17:23,561 --> 00:17:25,713
- Then go through the 4 hole!
- The 4 hole!

279
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:26,969
Come on, now.

280
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,255
What are you doing now?
Wait a sec!

281
00:17:32,023 --> 00:17:34,709
- What are you doing? You're killing me.
- I'm moving closer!

282
00:17:34,834 --> 00:17:37,303
- You're moving closer...
- So I can get to the 4 hole!

283
00:17:37,811 --> 00:17:40,777
Don't talk back to me!
Those fellas in stripped uniforms,

284
00:17:40,902 --> 00:17:42,725
they'll throw flags,
how many yards it'll be?

285
00:17:43,022 --> 00:17:44,381
- 5.
- Right, 5 yards.

286
00:17:44,506 --> 00:17:46,569
Here's what you're wanna do,
right over here.

287
00:17:46,694 --> 00:17:48,854
This is the 4 hole,
you'll go through the 4 hole

288
00:17:48,979 --> 00:17:51,764
and once you get through there
you're keep going downhill.

289
00:17:51,889 --> 00:17:53,653
- Yes, sir.
- Come on, let's go!

290
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:04,812
Goddamn, I didn't expect that.

291
00:18:05,187 --> 00:18:08,167
I cannot believe what I witnessed.
That's genius, Coach.

292
00:18:08,544 --> 00:18:10,974
This is exactly why I am here,
I'm serious.

293
00:18:11,099 --> 00:18:13,589
- I got goose-bumps.
- That's good.

294
00:18:14,055 --> 00:18:15,171
Hey, Vince.

295
00:18:15,843 --> 00:18:17,843
That was damn nice.
Damn nice.

296
00:18:19,417 --> 00:18:21,222
What do we got next? Let's go!

297
00:18:29,784 --> 00:18:32,537
- Ignore it.
- So pretty rough over at East Dillon?

298
00:18:32,662 --> 00:18:34,403
It's rough, to say the least.

299
00:18:34,528 --> 00:18:36,916
I'm constantly, like, ready.

300
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,782
I got a piece on me at all times.

301
00:18:44,321 --> 00:18:45,329
Julie Taylor!

302
00:18:46,443 --> 00:18:48,657
- How are you?
- Hey, J.D.

303
00:18:48,926 --> 00:18:51,075
So where's pizza man?

304
00:18:52,713 --> 00:18:54,293
He's gonna meet me later.

305
00:18:55,174 --> 00:18:58,648
My mom said she'd die
before she'd send me there.

306
00:18:58,886 --> 00:19:01,512
Like, she would literally
end her life?

307
00:19:01,836 --> 00:19:03,292
Hunger strike probably.

308
00:19:03,417 --> 00:19:04,844
Hey, you know Luke?

309
00:19:09,104 --> 00:19:11,480
You come watch me
make history on Friday night?

310
00:19:11,792 --> 00:19:13,566
Actually, I'm gonna go
see the Lions.

311
00:19:14,118 --> 00:19:15,526
I have news for you.

312
00:19:15,694 --> 00:19:18,559
Your dad's coaching a team
that's not gonna have one "W".

313
00:19:19,556 --> 00:19:20,364
But...

314
00:19:20,945 --> 00:19:22,241
I'm liking your chances.

315
00:19:25,621 --> 00:19:27,413
He's been kicking a few back.

316
00:19:27,581 --> 00:19:30,583
You know what, your dad could still
be coaching for Dillon.

317
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:32,957
My dad gave your dad a shot.

318
00:19:36,923 --> 00:19:38,132
Your dad's an ass.

319
00:19:38,656 --> 00:19:41,093
Okay, so now
I gotta throw you in the pool.

320
00:19:41,261 --> 00:19:43,429
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Hey, J.D.

321
00:19:43,597 --> 00:19:45,848
- What? Hey!
- Gonna throw you in the pool.

322
00:19:46,841 --> 00:19:48,430
Get the hell off her!

323
00:19:49,686 --> 00:19:52,021
What are you doing? Get off her!
Don't put your hands

324
00:19:52,189 --> 00:19:54,440
- on my girlfriend, okay?
- What's your problem?

325
00:19:55,656 --> 00:19:56,941
Shut the hell up!

326
00:20:04,117 --> 00:20:06,243
- What, Landry?
- Get off him!

327
00:20:08,689 --> 00:20:10,789
Coach shouldn't have
taken me out of the game!

328
00:20:11,322 --> 00:20:12,708
He just felt sorry for you.

329
00:20:16,445 --> 00:20:18,589
- Just shut up!
- You suck!

330
00:20:19,425 --> 00:20:21,383
I'm really glad
this wasn't a Panther party.

331
00:20:21,551 --> 00:20:23,001
It's my Dillon now!

332
00:20:29,751 --> 00:20:33,373
Billy, gotta be honest with you.
This is kind of gross.

333
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:37,280
I mean, whatever just happened
to pink or blue?

334
00:20:37,698 --> 00:20:38,722
Boy or girl?

335
00:20:39,124 --> 00:20:41,961
Mindy doesn't wanna know,
so we gotta use neutral tones.

336
00:20:42,086 --> 00:20:45,364
- Which is puke in this case?
- It's mustard, jackass.

337
00:20:45,489 --> 00:20:48,535
If I threw up on this wall
you wouldn't know it, this color's puke.

338
00:20:48,703 --> 00:20:49,794
It's mustard.

339
00:20:50,132 --> 00:20:53,108
- Agree to disagree.
- Seriously, do you have a problem?

340
00:20:54,029 --> 00:20:55,719
- Whatever.
- Whatever?

341
00:20:57,781 --> 00:21:00,276
- Billy, watch yourself.
- Shut your mouth.

342
00:21:00,401 --> 00:21:03,021
- Watch yourself.
- Or what? What are you gonna do?

343
00:21:06,944 --> 00:21:08,448
Billy, what the hell?

344
00:21:08,807 --> 00:21:10,759
You come into my house
and act like this?

345
00:21:11,268 --> 00:21:12,434
Get off me!

346
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,145
What the hell was that?

347
00:21:15,495 --> 00:21:16,605
I made a joke.

348
00:21:16,773 --> 00:21:18,396
It's not a freaking joke!

349
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,319
You're throwing away your life!

350
00:21:23,103 --> 00:21:26,227
I busted my ass for 8 years
to try and put you into college

351
00:21:26,352 --> 00:21:27,950
and you can't even make a month.

352
00:21:28,118 --> 00:21:29,451
You and Lyla...

353
00:21:30,007 --> 00:21:32,329
wanted me to go to college,
I never said once...

354
00:21:32,713 --> 00:21:34,998
- I wanna go to college.
- What you gonna do?

355
00:21:36,848 --> 00:21:39,043
I don't know
what you're thinking sometimes.

356
00:21:39,168 --> 00:21:42,379
That you're gonna waltz back in here
and everything's gonna be okay?

357
00:21:42,918 --> 00:21:44,466
I got a wife, Tim.

358
00:21:45,381 --> 00:21:46,866
I'm about to be a dad.

359
00:21:51,715 --> 00:21:53,513
There's no room for you here.

360
00:21:56,192 --> 00:21:57,588
Guess you're right.

361
00:21:59,565 --> 00:22:01,011
You know what, Billy?

362
00:22:03,717 --> 00:22:05,671
All I want to do is come home.

363
00:22:15,662 --> 00:22:17,625
I don't like
that we have to do this.

364
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,532
Nine students here
have been notified their transfer

365
00:22:20,657 --> 00:22:24,036
and are refusing to change schools.
What choice do we have?

366
00:22:29,493 --> 00:22:31,847
Ms. Cody?
I'm sorry to interrupt...

367
00:22:32,198 --> 00:22:32,998
y'all.

368
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:35,526
Devin, honey,

369
00:22:35,651 --> 00:22:39,396
- I'm gonna need you to come with me.
- Should I bring all my stuff?

370
00:22:39,936 --> 00:22:41,189
That'd be good.

371
00:22:51,742 --> 00:22:52,784
Thank you.

372
00:23:12,138 --> 00:23:16,141
You just have to pull the slot machine
and elbow the midget in the face.

373
00:23:16,309 --> 00:23:17,950
You understand though,

374
00:23:18,221 --> 00:23:20,270
I'm always gonna be a Panther

375
00:23:20,438 --> 00:23:21,755
- in my heart.
- Who cares?

376
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,572
They're a bunch of idiots this year.

377
00:23:23,697 --> 00:23:25,984
But a bunch
of talented, fast idiots.

378
00:23:26,152 --> 00:23:27,756
We're just a bunch of sucky idiots.

379
00:23:27,881 --> 00:23:30,363
Alright, so in the Panthers,
you're a scrub right?

380
00:23:30,531 --> 00:23:33,543
On the Lions, you might play.
You might even start!

381
00:23:33,801 --> 00:23:36,490
So you're trying to encourage me
by saying that the Lions

382
00:23:36,657 --> 00:23:39,313
are bad enough
that someone as bad as me might

383
00:23:39,438 --> 00:23:41,124
actually see some playing time?

384
00:23:41,728 --> 00:23:42,918
Yeah, basically.

385
00:23:43,086 --> 00:23:44,239
Yeah, grandma.

386
00:23:44,516 --> 00:23:47,723
Why aren't you throwing the ball?
You know you got a game Friday night.

387
00:23:47,848 --> 00:23:50,305
Coach Taylor
is gonna expect you to be ready.

388
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,387
Remember,
I'm not on the team anymore.

389
00:23:52,512 --> 00:23:53,850
Coach isn't either...

390
00:23:53,975 --> 00:23:55,963
Yeah, that'll be the day,
I adore you.

391
00:23:56,088 --> 00:23:57,914
Coach Taylor not a Panther...

392
00:24:00,566 --> 00:24:02,687
Stop throwing the ball,
you look like a girl.

393
00:24:02,855 --> 00:24:06,338
- I'm gonna throw one more.
- No, you look like a girl!

394
00:24:06,505 --> 00:24:09,611
- You're just a funny looking creature.
- It's good seeing you.

395
00:24:10,357 --> 00:24:11,863
She seems to be doing well.

396
00:24:12,404 --> 00:24:14,616
You think it's a bad sign
Julie ain't call me back?

397
00:24:15,509 --> 00:24:17,051
Probably not a good sign.

398
00:24:17,266 --> 00:24:19,658
You did look like a jackass
at the party the other night.

399
00:24:19,783 --> 00:24:20,914
J.D. is a chump!

400
00:24:21,386 --> 00:24:22,977
He's pretentious, he's...

401
00:24:23,144 --> 00:24:25,001
Aren't you supposed
to rise above that?

402
00:24:25,169 --> 00:24:27,345
Aren't you supposed
to turn the other cheek?

403
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:30,173
In your typical
Matt Saracen kind of way.

404
00:24:31,442 --> 00:24:32,815
Take the high road.

405
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:35,502
Right. Take the high road.
What Matt always does.

406
00:24:35,627 --> 00:24:37,026
Get behind me Satan...

407
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:45,397
Dog?

408
00:24:48,255 --> 00:24:49,067
Brother.

409
00:24:54,781 --> 00:24:55,831
Bottoms up.

410
00:25:02,822 --> 00:25:03,873
What's your name?

411
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,566
Olan, you need
to tighten up your splits.

412
00:25:08,691 --> 00:25:10,843
We're gonna run the ball,
play defense.

413
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:11,989
Defense!

414
00:25:12,527 --> 00:25:15,525
You need to figure out...
why it is you're out here.

415
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:17,466
This dude can talk, man.

416
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:19,799
Like that dude from the infomercial.

417
00:25:23,819 --> 00:25:25,774
You're a funny looking dude, man.

418
00:25:26,541 --> 00:25:27,981
Kinda look like Opie.

419
00:25:29,212 --> 00:25:31,360
You understand?
Maybe if I shine you up...

420
00:25:32,608 --> 00:25:35,318
Do you need a toy or something
to keep your attention?

421
00:25:35,485 --> 00:25:38,121
Will you please
just shut up and listen to him?

422
00:26:06,195 --> 00:26:07,195
Cowards!

423
00:26:09,229 --> 00:26:12,153
Cowards, that's what you all look like.
A bunch of cowards.

424
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:15,296
You all look like
a bunch of dumb asses out there.

425
00:26:16,711 --> 00:26:19,054
You don't fight on my field!

426
00:26:21,126 --> 00:26:23,953
Y'all wanna fight?
Go ahead and fight, but not on my field

427
00:26:24,162 --> 00:26:25,712
and not in my colors.

428
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:28,041
You got me?

429
00:26:28,391 --> 00:26:30,161
- Is that understood?
- Yes, sir.

430
00:26:30,286 --> 00:26:32,225
You don't fight in my house!

431
00:26:32,361 --> 00:26:35,465
Let me tell you something else,
there's no talking back on the field.

432
00:26:36,151 --> 00:26:37,879
There's no wearing earrings.

433
00:26:38,046 --> 00:26:39,531
There's no jewelry.

434
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:42,531
There's no damn necklaces out there!

435
00:26:42,698 --> 00:26:44,662
There's no talking to each other.

436
00:26:45,225 --> 00:26:46,809
There's you shutting up

437
00:26:46,977 --> 00:26:48,539
and there's me talking!

438
00:26:53,634 --> 00:26:54,534
You two.

439
00:26:54,701 --> 00:26:56,889
You two are gonna make it right,
right now!

440
00:26:57,056 --> 00:26:58,529
Make it right, right now.

441
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:04,305
I apologize.

442
00:27:09,845 --> 00:27:12,357
- Screw you, Rudy.
- Get your stuff and get out of here!

443
00:27:12,524 --> 00:27:15,053
You get your stuff
and get out of here right now!

444
00:27:15,591 --> 00:27:17,840
Get it right now
and get out of my house!

445
00:27:18,271 --> 00:27:20,051
Get the hell out of my house!

446
00:27:20,488 --> 00:27:22,845
Go, go!
Pack it up and get out!

447
00:27:23,315 --> 00:27:27,016
If anyone else in here
doesn't wanna be here, get out now!

448
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:30,728
Get the hell out of my house

449
00:27:31,139 --> 00:27:32,926
if you don't wanna be here!

450
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:35,107
Get out now!

451
00:27:35,597 --> 00:27:37,679
You don't wanna be here, then leave!

452
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:47,902
Anybody else?

453
00:27:48,455 --> 00:27:49,346
No, sir.

454
00:27:51,007 --> 00:27:52,157
Anybody else?

455
00:27:52,979 --> 00:27:53,829
No, sir.

456
00:27:57,881 --> 00:27:58,972
We're good?

457
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:03,638
I wanna play, Coach.

458
00:28:06,397 --> 00:28:07,547
I wanna play.

459
00:28:48,765 --> 00:28:50,474
Aren't you Tim Riggins?

460
00:28:53,084 --> 00:28:54,601
Panthers Tim Riggins?

461
00:28:55,021 --> 00:28:56,868
I know you hear me talking.

462
00:28:58,076 --> 00:29:00,056
I wonder if my mom
knows she slept with you?

463
00:29:00,181 --> 00:29:02,201
Well, she knows it, but...

464
00:29:02,326 --> 00:29:05,444
maybe it was dark,
she didn't realize it was Tim Riggins.

465
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:07,951
So, is she alive back there?

466
00:29:09,636 --> 00:29:10,736
She's alive.

467
00:29:10,983 --> 00:29:14,039
Is she gonna be
in any condition to drive anytime soon?

468
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:17,626
That's what I thought.

469
00:29:17,999 --> 00:29:19,865
Look, whatever you did to her,

470
00:29:20,421 --> 00:29:22,878
way to go #33,
but I need a ride to school.

471
00:29:27,445 --> 00:29:28,888
OK, try it again.

472
00:29:33,351 --> 00:29:35,519
- Your truck always break down?
- Sometimes.

473
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,878
Why don't you get a new truck?

474
00:29:39,449 --> 00:29:41,497
So did you hear me singing
this morning?

475
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,277
Sounded good, huh?

476
00:29:43,671 --> 00:29:46,385
Kinda makes you wanna stand up
and put your hand over your heart.

477
00:29:46,552 --> 00:29:48,240
- Like Faith Hill.
- For real?

478
00:29:48,408 --> 00:29:49,528
I love her!

479
00:29:50,547 --> 00:29:53,203
- I could sing for you if you wanted to.
- Try it again.

480
00:29:59,201 --> 00:30:01,628
What's it like being the guy
who used to be Tim Riggins?

481
00:30:01,998 --> 00:30:03,548
I'm still Tim Riggins.

482
00:30:04,509 --> 00:30:06,508
But, you know what I mean, though.

483
00:30:06,717 --> 00:30:09,785
You're all center of the universe
in Texas one year and the next,

484
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:13,487
- fall off a cliff.
- I haven't really thought about it.

485
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:15,893
What do you do with yourself now?

486
00:30:16,061 --> 00:30:18,041
How far is your school from here?

487
00:30:18,447 --> 00:30:20,824
- Not far, why?
- You gonna need to walk.

488
00:30:28,996 --> 00:30:31,542
Guys don't usually do
repeat performances with my mom,

489
00:30:31,667 --> 00:30:33,244
so guess I won't be seeing you.

490
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,163
Good luck, Tim Riggins.

491
00:30:38,288 --> 00:30:40,165
Hope you find
what you're looking for.

492
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,936
There's only eighteen here.

493
00:30:45,061 --> 00:30:47,592
Guess more of them decided
to take up on your offer to leave.

494
00:30:48,087 --> 00:30:50,562
That was a risky move.
That might not have paid off.

495
00:30:50,687 --> 00:30:51,862
I wish you'd learn

496
00:30:51,987 --> 00:30:54,139
to filter your thoughts better.
That'd be helpful.

497
00:30:54,987 --> 00:30:56,396
Filter my thoughts.

498
00:30:58,966 --> 00:31:00,366
Malcolm left, too?

499
00:31:01,312 --> 00:31:02,648
Malcolm left, too.

500
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:06,901
Malcolm left too.

501
00:31:08,343 --> 00:31:09,655
Here's what we'll do.

502
00:31:10,087 --> 00:31:12,969
We're gonna line up in the power Iowa
and perfect the 5 and the 6.

503
00:31:13,094 --> 00:31:14,201
Perfect 5 and 6.

504
00:31:14,369 --> 00:31:17,537
We're gonna power the ball downfield
and keep the ball away from South King.

505
00:31:18,966 --> 00:31:20,513
You need to stop doing that.

506
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,157
You need to stop repeating
everything I say!

507
00:31:26,532 --> 00:31:28,057
It's freaking me out.

508
00:31:34,462 --> 00:31:36,891
You know we got no chance
to win this game.

509
00:31:37,293 --> 00:31:38,684
What are you doing here?

510
00:31:39,749 --> 00:31:42,521
- I came to coach them up.
- Not with that hat on, you know.

511
00:31:43,136 --> 00:31:44,402
You got another one?

512
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,528
The last one I got.
We're outta money.

513
00:31:49,292 --> 00:31:50,413
It's alright.

514
00:31:54,385 --> 00:31:55,929
<i>Folks, it is here.</i>

515
00:31:56,054 --> 00:31:56,896
<i>D-Day.</i>

516
00:31:57,021 --> 00:32:00,583
<i>Not one, but two football games
in our little town.</i>

517
00:32:01,249 --> 00:32:03,969
<i>Will redistricting destroy
Dillon football as we know it?</i>

518
00:32:04,094 --> 00:32:05,691
Smells funny in there...

519
00:32:08,005 --> 00:32:10,146
OK, you look nice.
We need some more cream.

520
00:32:10,271 --> 00:32:11,849
I'll try to get it this weekend.

521
00:32:12,303 --> 00:32:16,040
Can you see that hook back there?
Can you get it for me, thank you.

522
00:32:16,764 --> 00:32:20,038
I can't believe I'll miss your game.
The first game of our relationship.

523
00:32:20,163 --> 00:32:22,671
- A good one to miss.
- I'm sad about it.

524
00:32:22,796 --> 00:32:25,721
- You flip the coin, critical role.
- Are you sad, stressed out?

525
00:32:25,846 --> 00:32:28,040
- Don't be brave.
- Nothing to be stressed out.

526
00:32:28,165 --> 00:32:29,526
There you go, I gotcha.

527
00:32:29,694 --> 00:32:31,945
Tell you what I'm gonna do,
I'll flip my coin.

528
00:32:33,212 --> 00:32:36,575
And then I'm gonna sneak out,
and come over to East Dillon.

529
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,767
- And gonna watch y'all get your "W".
- Flip the coin!

530
00:32:41,176 --> 00:32:44,479
- Gross, gross, gross...
- Hi, honey!

531
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:47,053
Are you ready for school?

532
00:32:47,314 --> 00:32:49,421
I think I'm gonna go
to East Dillon this year.

533
00:32:50,232 --> 00:32:51,047
What?

534
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:53,884
Well, I mean...

535
00:32:54,343 --> 00:32:57,756
Devin goes there, Landry goes there,
all my other friends have graduated.

536
00:32:57,881 --> 00:33:00,562
So I think
that it's a really good move for me.

537
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,729
You keep saying how East Dillon
is just as good as West Dillon.

538
00:33:05,897 --> 00:33:07,272
And I just think

539
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,811
it would be beneficial to our family
if I went to East Dillon.

540
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:14,625
Alright.

541
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:16,865
Good. It's decided.

542
00:33:21,967 --> 00:33:23,167
Say something.

543
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:37,677
<i>I am on the battlefield</i>

544
00:33:37,845 --> 00:33:40,335
<i>For my Lord.</i>

545
00:33:41,725 --> 00:33:44,659
<i>I'm on the battlefield</i>

546
00:33:45,269 --> 00:33:47,520
<i>For my Lord,</i>

547
00:33:48,372 --> 00:33:51,733
<i>And I promise Him that I...</i>

548
00:33:52,596 --> 00:33:55,704
<i>I will serve Him 'til I die.</i>

549
00:33:56,418 --> 00:33:59,449
<i>I'm on the battlefield...</i>

550
00:33:59,618 --> 00:34:01,451
<i>For my Lord.</i>

551
00:34:02,796 --> 00:34:04,204
Here we go. Take a knee!

552
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:07,540
How we doing on time?
Good? Alright.

553
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,878
Everybody got what they need?

554
00:34:12,047 --> 00:34:13,912
Everybody squared the way
with equipment?

555
00:34:17,023 --> 00:34:19,636
Listen up, now.
A few of you have been here before.

556
00:34:20,061 --> 00:34:21,606
A few of you have not.

557
00:34:21,731 --> 00:34:25,392
One thing we've all got to do tonight,
is we've got to focus.

558
00:34:26,576 --> 00:34:27,993
The game plan.

559
00:34:28,437 --> 00:34:30,480
The fundamentals.
Moving the sticks,

560
00:34:30,649 --> 00:34:32,232
that's what we're gonna do.

561
00:34:32,996 --> 00:34:34,526
And listen, fellas.

562
00:34:35,391 --> 00:34:37,631
There's a joy in this game,
is there not?

563
00:34:38,899 --> 00:34:42,575
There's a passion to this game
as a reason why we're all out here.

564
00:34:43,467 --> 00:34:46,246
Other than the fact
that the pride that it gives us

565
00:34:46,858 --> 00:34:49,415
and the respect that it demands,

566
00:34:49,715 --> 00:34:52,377
we love to play the game,
so let's go out there

567
00:34:52,545 --> 00:34:54,212
and let's have fun tonight.

568
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:57,382
Do you understand me?
Because tomorrow...

569
00:34:57,551 --> 00:35:01,302
if you give a 100% of yourself tonight,
people will look at you differently.

570
00:35:01,722 --> 00:35:04,264
People are gonna
think of you differently.

571
00:35:05,279 --> 00:35:06,563
And I promise you...

572
00:35:08,318 --> 00:35:10,979
You're gonna look and think
differently about yourselves.

573
00:35:13,899 --> 00:35:16,603
Clear eyes, full hearts...

574
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:22,115
Can't lose.

575
00:35:22,725 --> 00:35:24,617
Clear eyes, full hearts...

576
00:35:24,785 --> 00:35:26,119
Can't lose!

577
00:35:26,288 --> 00:35:29,288
Let's hear it, gentlemen.
Clear eyes, full hearts...

578
00:35:29,457 --> 00:35:32,000
- Can't lose!
- Let's go play some football.

579
00:35:36,547 --> 00:35:37,803
Let's go!

580
00:35:47,474 --> 00:35:49,934
<i>Opening night here
in Panther Stadium.</i>

581
00:35:50,103 --> 00:35:53,229
And I tell you,
this crowd is pumped up!

582
00:35:53,639 --> 00:36:00,027
<i>O say, does that star-spangled</i>

583
00:36:00,196 --> 00:36:05,862
<i>banner yet wave</i>

584
00:36:06,702 --> 00:36:11,622
<i>O'er the land of the free</i>

585
00:36:13,822 --> 00:36:16,655
<i>and the home</i>

586
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:20,673
<i>of the brave.</i>

587
00:36:25,095 --> 00:36:28,306
You've got four quarters to play
your hearts out. You understand that?

588
00:36:28,475 --> 00:36:30,725
- Yes, sir!
- Go for it!

589
00:36:36,176 --> 00:36:39,400
Listen up, we win the toss,
we wanna go D, okay?

590
00:36:39,977 --> 00:36:42,612
That means we're kicking off,
we wanna go D.

591
00:36:42,781 --> 00:36:44,155
Defense, we're kicking off!

592
00:36:44,324 --> 00:36:47,909
- Let's go, boys!
- Tami, we like heads!

593
00:36:50,204 --> 00:36:52,583
- How you doing? Tami Taylor.
- Good evening.

594
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,291
- Shake your hands, please.
- Well done.

595
00:36:55,751 --> 00:36:57,347
Nice to meet you.
Welcome.

596
00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:00,276
Principal Taylor is honorary captain,
she's gonna call the toss.

597
00:37:00,401 --> 00:37:02,960
We have heads, we have tails.
What are you gonna call?

598
00:37:03,085 --> 00:37:05,426
- Tails.
- The call is tails.

599
00:37:06,884 --> 00:37:08,554
Tails it is.

600
00:37:08,723 --> 00:37:11,700
- Choice?
- We will take the ball. Offense.

601
00:37:12,035 --> 00:37:13,267
What did she say?

602
00:37:13,436 --> 00:37:16,312
- No, we wanted defense.
- Please step around right here.

603
00:37:16,481 --> 00:37:20,386
What did she say?
Offense? Offense?

604
00:37:20,693 --> 00:37:23,027
Y'all have a great game, now.

605
00:37:23,196 --> 00:37:26,656
Change of plans!
Listen up!

606
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,992
<i>And here we go, folks.</i>

607
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:32,953
<i>Oh, it's a long, high,
beautiful kick.</i>

608
00:37:33,122 --> 00:37:36,791
<i>And East Dillon football is back.
It's Vince Howard to the goal line.</i>

609
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,126
<i>He finds a lane to the outside.</i>

610
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,712
Run it, baby!

611
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,422
<i>Look at this kid go, he is fast.</i>

612
00:37:44,841 --> 00:37:46,133
<i>Brutal hit!</i>

613
00:37:46,302 --> 00:37:48,511
<i>Vince Howard is down.
Oh, my!</i>

614
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,222
- <i>I can't believe he's getting up.</i>
- 24-power!

615
00:37:51,391 --> 00:37:53,724
Keep you focus, alright?
Get him out there.

616
00:37:53,893 --> 00:37:56,018
Keep focus, gentlemen.
Let's go!

617
00:37:56,427 --> 00:37:59,313
24-power, on one.
Ready?

618
00:38:00,412 --> 00:38:03,425
<i>This is it, folks.
Olsen bringing the Lions to the line.</i>

619
00:38:03,837 --> 00:38:04,841
Set!

620
00:38:06,157 --> 00:38:09,052
<i>There's the snap. Oh, my!
I think that went right through.</i>

621
00:38:09,177 --> 00:38:11,408
- What are you doing?
- <i>Fumble!</i>

622
00:38:11,784 --> 00:38:15,412
<i>The first play from scrimmage,
we are not off to a pretty start here.</i>

623
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,883
Come on, now!

624
00:38:17,008 --> 00:38:19,818
<i>Olsen opens left.
Quick toss to Howard.</i>

625
00:38:19,943 --> 00:38:23,100
<i>Trying to get to the outside,
he's got nowhere to go.</i>

626
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,509
Don't give me that!

627
00:38:28,678 --> 00:38:31,011
<i>Vince Howard gets drilled
to the backfield.</i>

628
00:38:31,393 --> 00:38:33,685
<i>He got decimated
on that play, folks.</i>

629
00:38:35,964 --> 00:38:37,101
Shut up!

630
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:38,686
Barracuda right trips.

631
00:38:38,855 --> 00:38:40,782
What? That's not the play.

632
00:38:42,581 --> 00:38:46,569
- Oklahoma right trip.
- Oklahoma right! Ready?

633
00:38:47,409 --> 00:38:49,863
<i>Olsen back to pass.
Pressure coming!</i>

634
00:38:52,044 --> 00:38:54,059
- <i>Olsen goes down hard.</i>
- What is that?

635
00:38:54,369 --> 00:38:56,912
- Why is that?
- Come on, open your eye!

636
00:38:58,008 --> 00:39:01,083
<i>South King on the speed's way,
he's got the outside.</i>

637
00:39:01,252 --> 00:39:04,309
<i>Fantastic blocking.
He could go, folks.</i>

638
00:39:05,046 --> 00:39:06,505
<i>Here we go!</i>

639
00:39:06,674 --> 00:39:09,008
<i>Touchdown, South King.</i>

640
00:39:09,177 --> 00:39:12,803
Someone to get him off the field?
Get him off the field!

641
00:39:12,971 --> 00:39:15,293
<i>Late in second quarter,
South King back to pass.</i>

642
00:39:15,418 --> 00:39:20,144
<i>He's got a man. Reservation for six.
Another South King touchdown.</i>

643
00:39:20,462 --> 00:39:23,564
Alright. Come on, guys.
28-bounce.

644
00:39:24,068 --> 00:39:25,566
28-bound!

645
00:39:25,735 --> 00:39:28,402
- Can't even feel my arms, man.
- We need you!

646
00:39:29,613 --> 00:39:32,434
28-bounce, on one. Ready?

647
00:39:33,742 --> 00:39:35,951
<i>Olsen back to pass.
They need something here.</i>

648
00:39:36,501 --> 00:39:39,413
<i>Across the middle.
Oh, it's picked up by South King!</i>

649
00:39:40,874 --> 00:39:44,126
<i>He's got a lane to the outside.
Howard's got an angle.</i>

650
00:39:45,406 --> 00:39:47,296
<i>And Vince Howard is cracked</i>

651
00:39:47,465 --> 00:39:50,174
<i>at the 40, and another
South King touchdown.</i>

652
00:40:02,729 --> 00:40:05,105
<i>This is getting
flat out ugly, folks.</i>

653
00:40:05,531 --> 00:40:08,506
<i>Coach Taylor is known for his
remarkable half-time adjustments,</i>

654
00:40:08,631 --> 00:40:11,105
<i>but I don't know if there is
an adjustment to this.</i>

655
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:15,221
<i>This is as bad as anything
I have ever seen on a football field.</i>

656
00:40:16,993 --> 00:40:18,577
Can you flex it for me?

657
00:40:20,452 --> 00:40:21,997
We'll unwrap it.

658
00:40:27,337 --> 00:40:29,286
Easy, just relax.

659
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:31,632
I can't stop it from twitching.

660
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:45,979
He didn't break it, but he's got
a hell of a high ankle sprain.

661
00:40:46,484 --> 00:40:48,750
Tell him.
Tell him I'll still go.

662
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,186
Alright, we'll tape it and see.

663
00:40:51,635 --> 00:40:53,570
- I can play.
- I hear you.

664
00:40:55,824 --> 00:40:58,200
- What you got? Let me see.
- Stitches.

665
00:40:58,369 --> 00:41:00,147
He didn't say anything.

666
00:41:03,984 --> 00:41:05,207
How you doing?

667
00:41:05,778 --> 00:41:06,708
I'm solid.

668
00:41:10,956 --> 00:41:12,466
- You alright?
- Yes, sir.

669
00:41:12,591 --> 00:41:14,732
- What you got?
- Nothing, just...

670
00:41:16,636 --> 00:41:19,229
- Does this hurt?
- I think it's alright.

671
00:41:39,682 --> 00:41:41,794
Hey, Coach,
you got a few more minutes.

672
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:49,209
We gotta call the game.

673
00:41:49,603 --> 00:41:52,384
- What?
- I said we gotta call the game.

674
00:41:53,589 --> 00:41:56,179
- Are you sure...
- Yeah, I gotta call the end game.

675
00:41:56,647 --> 00:41:58,844
- Just like that?
- You want a dissertation?

676
00:41:59,013 --> 00:42:00,929
- I understand you're upset.
- Fine.

677
00:42:01,298 --> 00:42:03,723
We would like to forfeit the game,
how does that sound?

678
