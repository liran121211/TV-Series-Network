1
00:00:02,944 --> 00:00:04,245
- No.

2
00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:06,547
I can't do this.

3
00:00:06,581 --> 00:00:09,650
- My name's luke.
- I know who you are.

4
00:00:09,684 --> 00:00:11,919
- It's your dad.

5
00:00:11,953 --> 00:00:13,153
He was killed.

6
00:00:13,188 --> 00:00:14,989
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:15,023 --> 00:00:17,992
Are you all right?

8
00:00:18,026 --> 00:00:20,661
- Yeah, I'm fine.

9
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:32,573
- And this Friday's game between
the east dillon lions

10
00:00:32,607 --> 00:00:35,242
And the mcnulty mavericks
promises to be a barn burner,

11
00:00:35,277 --> 00:00:38,479
At least on one side
of the ball.

12
00:00:38,513 --> 00:00:40,681
Mcnulty is the favorite to upset
the panthers' reign this year,

13
00:00:40,715 --> 00:00:44,385
And their undefeated record
has them in prime position

14
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:46,320
For that playoff spot.

15
00:00:46,354 --> 00:00:48,322
You got to wonder
how fast and how often

16
00:00:48,356 --> 00:00:50,224
This mcnulty offense
is gonna score

17
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:52,026
On this poor lions' defense.

18
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,527
Flip the tv on
for this game.

19
00:00:53,561 --> 00:00:55,162
It's gonna be a track meet.

20
00:00:55,196 --> 00:00:57,031
- You hear that, man?

21
00:00:57,065 --> 00:00:58,032
You one sorry, brother.
You know that, vince?

22
00:00:58,066 --> 00:00:59,667
- Go ahead, cal.

23
00:00:59,701 --> 00:01:01,936
- I mean, it's one thing
to be on the team that sucks.

24
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:03,904
It's a whole other thing
to be on a team

25
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:06,807
That suck on tv,
all right?

26
00:01:06,841 --> 00:01:09,343
Everybody watching too?

27
00:01:09,377 --> 00:01:11,111
- Calvin, shut up.
- Couldn't be me, man.

28
00:01:11,146 --> 00:01:12,212
- All right, yeah, I know.

29
00:01:12,247 --> 00:01:13,213
- That's why I quit that
sorry-ass team.

30
00:01:13,248 --> 00:01:14,848
You know what
I'm saying?

31
00:01:14,883 --> 00:01:17,651
- Mcnulty's averaging
53 points a game.

32
00:01:17,686 --> 00:01:20,587
They got the second ranked
offense in the state.

33
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,723
Coach, they've only punted twice
the whole damn season.

34
00:01:22,757 --> 00:01:24,525
- Friday, we are gonna
keep it simple.

35
00:01:24,559 --> 00:01:26,093
- These are offensive plays.

36
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:27,594
- "offensive," stan.

37
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:28,896
"offensive" plays.

38
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,164
- Listen up now.

39
00:01:30,198 --> 00:01:32,333
Mcnulty's undefeated.
Game's televised.

40
00:01:32,367 --> 00:01:34,335
It's a game-changer.
I don't like it.

41
00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:36,503
- That's what
I'm talking about.

42
00:01:36,538 --> 00:01:38,372
- What we're gonna do
is we're gonna

43
00:01:38,406 --> 00:01:40,274
Go down to the field
with the media.

44
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:44,278
We're gonna talk briefly
with the reporters.

45
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:49,016
- All right,
let's keep it simple.

46
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:50,918
- I'm not finished.

47
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,394
- Wait, wait, wait.

48
00:02:00,428 --> 00:02:01,962
I totally just
remembered something.

49
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:03,931
- Oh, no.
What? You're pregnant?

50
00:02:03,965 --> 00:02:05,799
- you are, aren't you?

51
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:08,435
- I'm having twins actually,
but they're aliens.

52
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,937
- Damn it!
I don't want twins.

53
00:02:09,971 --> 00:02:12,506
- So I bought these tickets

54
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,175
For the austin
indie music festival,

55
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,944
And it was supposed
to be a surprise, but--

56
00:02:16,978 --> 00:02:18,846
- Oh, but then my dad died.
- Yeah.

57
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,748
I can give 'em to devin
or something.

58
00:02:20,782 --> 00:02:23,117
- No, no, no, no, no.
We ought to go.

59
00:02:23,151 --> 00:02:24,718
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

60
00:02:24,753 --> 00:02:26,687
And you know what?

61
00:02:26,721 --> 00:02:29,423
Actually someone gave me, like,
this grieving handbook thing,

62
00:02:29,457 --> 00:02:31,658
And chapter two said,
"when your dad dies,

63
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,527
"you should most
likely probably go

64
00:02:33,561 --> 00:02:36,397
To a music festival,
preferably in austin."

65
00:02:36,431 --> 00:02:38,832
- You're such a liar.
- I'm not a liar.

66
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,667
- Are you sure
you're gonna be okay?

67
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,836
- I'll be fine.
Look, he's--

68
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,204
He's dead, all right?

69
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,940
And I'm--I'm alive.

70
00:02:46,975 --> 00:02:48,942
So let's go.

71
00:02:48,977 --> 00:02:50,144
- Okay.

72
00:02:50,178 --> 00:02:52,780
- Hey, guys.
How you doing?

73
00:02:52,814 --> 00:02:54,381
Hey, mike. How are you?

74
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:57,384
- Coach, what are your goals
going into this game?

75
00:02:57,419 --> 00:02:58,685
- Goals going into the game?

76
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,953
Well, we'd like
to stop their offense

77
00:02:59,988 --> 00:03:01,388
And put a few holes
in their defense.

78
00:03:01,423 --> 00:03:03,257
- How do you intend to measure
your success in doing that?

79
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:04,792
- Well, we're gonna use
the scoreboard

80
00:03:04,826 --> 00:03:06,560
To measure that success.

81
00:03:06,594 --> 00:03:07,928
- What do you hope
to accomplish there?

82
00:03:07,962 --> 00:03:10,164
I mean, what do you want
the score to reflect?

83
00:03:10,198 --> 00:03:12,399
- I would like
for the score to reflect

84
00:03:12,434 --> 00:03:14,568
That we left everything
on the field that we had.

85
00:03:14,602 --> 00:03:16,070
- So are you saying you're
gonna win this game, coach?

86
00:03:16,104 --> 00:03:17,671
- Well, what I'm saying is--

87
00:03:17,705 --> 00:03:19,339
- We can win
and we will win.

88
00:03:19,374 --> 00:03:20,974
- Are you guaranteeing
a victory?

89
00:03:21,009 --> 00:03:22,676
- I am guaranteeing a victory.

90
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,611
We got to start practice,
okay?

91
00:03:24,646 --> 00:03:25,746
- Good. Let's do this.

92
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,081
- Get these fine young
men out here

93
00:03:27,115 --> 00:03:28,782
Who are gonna be putting
their blood on the field!

94
00:03:30,385 --> 00:03:33,687
Becky, come on.

95
00:03:41,863 --> 00:03:43,630
- Hey.

96
00:03:43,665 --> 00:03:47,734
- Hey.

97
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,837
Nice place.

98
00:03:49,871 --> 00:03:52,706
- Yeah, it's,
um, something.

99
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,408
So I saw you at the funeral.

100
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,410
- Yeah, I saw you too.

101
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:58,479
- Thought you'd be back
at college by now.

102
00:03:58,513 --> 00:04:01,148
- Midterm break.

103
00:04:01,182 --> 00:04:02,649
I stayed to see my dad.

104
00:04:02,684 --> 00:04:07,087
- Oh.
That's nice.

105
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:08,489
- "that's nice."
that's it?

106
00:04:08,523 --> 00:04:12,459
- I mean...
It's not nice?

107
00:04:14,996 --> 00:04:17,264
Oh, you are something, huh?

108
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:20,167
You stop calling.
You disappear.

109
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:22,069
That's nice.

110
00:04:22,103 --> 00:04:24,438
My dad says you threw away
the scholarship.

111
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,006
- Mm-hmm.

112
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,244
Yeah, I did.

113
00:04:30,278 --> 00:04:32,613
- Wow.

114
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:36,483
I am--
I'm so glad I came over.

115

116
00:05:36,277 --> 00:05:37,444
- No, no, no.
- Mom!

117
00:05:37,478 --> 00:05:38,979
It's two days.
It's not a week.

118
00:05:39,013 --> 00:05:41,648
- It is two nights
in austin during exams.

119
00:05:41,683 --> 00:05:43,917
Absolutely not.
It's a ridiculous thing.

120
00:05:43,952 --> 00:05:45,185
You haven't even been
accepted into college yet.

121
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,787
- So if I would have gotten
into college,

122
00:05:46,821 --> 00:05:48,722
This would be a completely
conversation because...

123
00:05:48,756 --> 00:05:49,990
- If you had passed
your exams already

124
00:05:50,024 --> 00:05:51,959
And you had gotten accepted
into three schools

125
00:05:51,993 --> 00:05:54,528
Early decision then, yes,
you can go to austin, texas,

126
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:57,231
On two school nights
and enjoy a music show.

127
00:05:57,265 --> 00:06:00,067
Yes, I think in that situation,
I'd be all right with it.

128
00:06:00,101 --> 00:06:02,236
- Matt's dad just died, mom.

129
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,972
- I'm not gonna dignify
that with even a response.

130
00:06:05,006 --> 00:06:06,306
Come on, jules.

131
00:06:06,341 --> 00:06:07,874
- What's going on?

132
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,544
- Dad, can I go to the music
festival with matt?

133
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,279
- Hi, sweet girl--
the music festival

134
00:06:12,313 --> 00:06:15,249
In the middle of the week
in austin, texas, sweetheart.

135
00:06:15,283 --> 00:06:17,150
- No, I don't think you're gonna
be going to austin with matt.

136
00:06:17,185 --> 00:06:19,820
- You guys are awful!

137
00:06:19,854 --> 00:06:22,623
- Oh.

138
00:06:22,657 --> 00:06:24,191
Look, matt, I'm sorry.

139
00:06:24,225 --> 00:06:25,726
- You should be, man.
You suck.

140
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,194
I been working
with you a lot lately--

141
00:06:27,228 --> 00:06:28,662
- That is not at all
what I was talking about.

142
00:06:28,696 --> 00:06:30,030
I was talking about your dad,
so thanks.

143
00:06:30,064 --> 00:06:31,732
- I know. I know.

144
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,400
You know they--

145
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,435
They're giving us,
like, a death gratuity.

146
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,304
- A what?
Death gratuity?

147
00:06:37,338 --> 00:06:39,439
- Yeah, it's, like, $100,000.

148
00:06:39,474 --> 00:06:41,141
- Does it come in a tip jar?

149
00:06:41,175 --> 00:06:43,176
- No.
They just--

150
00:06:43,211 --> 00:06:46,880
I guess they tack it on with
the life insurance policies,

151
00:06:46,914 --> 00:06:48,415
So grandma's--

152
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,916
You know, she's just set up
for the rest of her life.

153
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:53,387
- Well, that's good.
What about you?

154
00:06:53,421 --> 00:06:57,891
- What about me?

155
00:06:57,925 --> 00:06:59,126
- I don't know.

156
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,827
How are you doing,
I guess?

157
00:07:00,862 --> 00:07:01,862
- I'm fine, man.

158
00:07:01,896 --> 00:07:02,863
I don't understand
why people keep

159
00:07:02,897 --> 00:07:03,864
Asking me how I'm doing.

160
00:07:03,898 --> 00:07:04,865
I'm fine.

161
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:06,033
People just keep saying,
"are you okay?"

162
00:07:06,067 --> 00:07:07,034
- Well, matt,
I don't really know

163
00:07:07,068 --> 00:07:08,101
What to say
in this situation.

164
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,336
- Well, then don't say--

165
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,504
You don't have
to say anything, all right?

166
00:07:10,538 --> 00:07:11,805
It's over with.
We took care of all that,

167
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:13,006
And now we're just
throwing a football.

168
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:14,508
Is that okay?
Is that okay with you?

169
00:07:14,542 --> 00:07:15,842
- I'm really start
to get the feeling

170
00:07:15,877 --> 00:07:17,377
That you just want
to fight.

171
00:07:17,412 --> 00:07:18,545
I don't know if you
want me to give you

172
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:20,847
Some kind of big, uh, speech.

173
00:07:20,882 --> 00:07:23,717
I don't know what it is
that you want me to do.

174
00:07:23,751 --> 00:07:24,985
But I'm not gonna do that.

175
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:26,320
I don't care what you do.

176
00:07:26,354 --> 00:07:29,489
But either way, I'm gonna
be your best friend,

177
00:07:29,524 --> 00:07:33,026
'cause you've been my best
friend since we were five.

178
00:07:33,061 --> 00:07:37,664
- Yeah, all right.

179
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:39,333
- Hey, honey.

180
00:07:39,367 --> 00:07:40,734
Hey, y'all.

181
00:07:40,768 --> 00:07:42,336
Oh, messages, messages?

182
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,670
- Of course.
Of course.

183
00:07:43,705 --> 00:07:46,940
The pta meeting has been changed
to Friday the 28th.

184
00:07:46,974 --> 00:07:48,375
Clint wants you
to meet the new hire

185
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:50,644
For ap spanish,
and mrs. Corrigan called

186
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,646
To request that her son
be moved out of calculus.

187
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,714
- Oh, goodness.
- Her number's here--

188
00:07:53,748 --> 00:07:55,415
- Okay, thank you so much.

189
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,250
- Oh, and your daughter
called and she said

190
00:07:57,285 --> 00:07:58,518
For you not to worry
about anything.

191
00:07:58,553 --> 00:07:59,753
She'd see you on Saturday.

192
00:07:59,787 --> 00:08:02,456
- Wait.
What was that?

193
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,523
- Yeah, she said--

194
00:08:03,558 --> 00:08:05,158
She said she was going
to austin.

195
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,226
- She did?

196
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,061
- Called 15 minutes ago,
maybe.

197
00:08:08,096 --> 00:08:09,496
- All right.

198
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,997
Could you just, um,
get that door?

199
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:14,968
Thank you very much.

200
00:08:15,002 --> 00:08:17,537
Julie, this is your
mother calling.

201
00:08:17,572 --> 00:08:18,839
I just got
the strangest message

202
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,707
From the secretary
in the office

203
00:08:20,742 --> 00:08:22,676
That you have gone
to austin,

204
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,244
Which I know cannot
be true,

205
00:08:24,278 --> 00:08:26,179
Considering the fact that both
your father and I told you

206
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,547
That you could not go
to austin.

207
00:08:27,582 --> 00:08:28,982
So you had best
call me back right away.

208
00:08:29,016 --> 00:08:31,585
Thank you very much.

209
00:08:37,425 --> 00:08:39,326
- Hello, stranger.

210
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,161
- So look, I think--
I think the best thing

211
00:08:41,195 --> 00:08:43,864
To do here in this situation
is just completely mature

212
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,365
About all this.

213
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,800
- Uh-huh?
- You know?

214
00:08:46,834 --> 00:08:49,102
And first off,
I just want to say

215
00:08:49,137 --> 00:08:52,539
Kissing you was great.

216
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:54,040
You know?

217
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,042
Um, you're--that was great.
You're great.

218
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,445
So just know that
bottom line, you know?

219
00:08:58,479 --> 00:08:59,913
- Uh-huh?

220
00:08:59,947 --> 00:09:02,549
- Well, you see,
there's this part of me

221
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,117
That's like,
maybe we should just kind of

222
00:09:04,152 --> 00:09:05,652
See where it goes,
see what happens,

223
00:09:05,686 --> 00:09:07,454
Not really think
about it too much.

224
00:09:07,488 --> 00:09:09,055
Then there's
this other really, really

225
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,124
Kind of tiny part
of me

226
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:15,295
That's still hung up
on this other girl tyra,

227
00:09:15,329 --> 00:09:19,399
Who's, like, embedded
in the back of my mind,

228
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:22,736
So I think
the mature thing--

229
00:09:26,707 --> 00:09:29,776
I really didn't
see that coming.

230
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:36,450
- Will I see you later?

231
00:09:36,484 --> 00:09:37,818
- Like when?

232
00:09:37,852 --> 00:09:39,419
- Five minutes.

233
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:44,491
Maybe three.

234
00:09:44,525 --> 00:09:46,359
- I go back to school
in three days.

235
00:09:46,394 --> 00:09:48,328
- You go back to school
in three days.

236
00:09:48,362 --> 00:09:50,096
See, I don't know
if you know this,

237
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,532
But I'm kind of a
moment-to-moment kind of guy,

238
00:09:52,567 --> 00:09:54,768
So three days...
- Uh-huh?

239
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,002
- I can work with that.

240
00:09:56,037 --> 00:09:57,504
- What's that mean exactly?

241
00:09:57,538 --> 00:09:59,005
That you can
"work with that?"

242
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,241
- No.

243
00:10:01,275 --> 00:10:04,044
I could probably tell you,
but...

244
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:05,645
- I'm dying to know.

245
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,448
- showing you might be
even better.

246
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,984
I can show you what it means
to work with it.

247
00:10:13,387 --> 00:10:14,921
- Ow!
- They're sharp, I know.

248
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,925
- How you doing?
- I'm good.

249
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,028
- Good.
I'll miss you.

250
00:10:23,731 --> 00:10:25,432
- Tim riggins!

251
00:10:25,466 --> 00:10:26,867
Okay, look,
I know you're inhere.

252
00:10:26,901 --> 00:10:28,401
- Just 'cause there's
a girl at my door,

253
00:10:28,436 --> 00:10:31,438
I don't have a girlfriend.

254
00:10:31,472 --> 00:10:33,340
- Okay, you're not ignoring me,
right?

255
00:10:33,374 --> 00:10:34,841
Because I just want
to let you know that

256
00:10:34,876 --> 00:10:37,110
I'm not gonna jump on you every
time I see you or anything.

257
00:10:37,144 --> 00:10:42,382
- Yeah, hi.
- Oh, hey.

258
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:47,220
- Lyla, becky.
Becky, lyla.

259
00:10:47,255 --> 00:10:48,989
- Hi.
- Hi.

260
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,091
- Yeah, I was just gonna ask
for a ride to school,

261
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:52,359
But it's cool.

262
00:10:52,393 --> 00:10:53,894
I know you're busy.
- Okay.

263
00:10:53,928 --> 00:10:55,929
- I'll see you later.

264
00:10:58,599 --> 00:11:03,703
- That was, um,
the landlord's daughter.

265
00:11:03,738 --> 00:11:04,738
- Mm-hmm.

266
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:09,809
- How are you gonna play
this Friday night?

267
00:11:09,844 --> 00:11:10,810
- We've been through the storm.

268
00:11:10,845 --> 00:11:11,811
We've been through the rain.

269
00:11:11,846 --> 00:11:13,013
Now we fixing
to bring the pain.

270
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,714
- Well, emily, I think,
you know,

271
00:11:14,749 --> 00:11:17,617
I scored a perfect score
on my math portion of the s.A.T.

272
00:11:17,652 --> 00:11:19,619
So, you know,
if the pressure's on,

273
00:11:19,654 --> 00:11:22,622
I think I'm the guy
to go to, emily.

274
00:11:22,657 --> 00:11:24,357
- Do you have anything more
to say about

275
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:27,727
That guaranteed win?

276
00:11:27,762 --> 00:11:31,731
- Well, I'm more of the brains
and brawn, you know?

277
00:11:31,766 --> 00:11:33,233
I got it all.
I'm the total package, baby.

278
00:11:33,267 --> 00:11:34,234
- Are you gonna win?

279
00:11:40,141 --> 00:11:42,475
- Coach, could we talk about
your history of quitting,

280
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,578
First with the panthers
back in '06,

281
00:11:44,612 --> 00:11:47,180
And more recently,
forfeiting your first game

282
00:11:47,214 --> 00:11:48,815
As head coach of the lions?

283
00:11:48,849 --> 00:11:50,350
- Don't know why you
come out here

284
00:11:50,384 --> 00:11:51,952
And waste people's time
with this.

285
00:11:55,156 --> 00:11:57,190
- This is romantic.

286
00:11:57,224 --> 00:11:58,858
Nice breeze.
It's perfect.

287
00:11:58,893 --> 00:12:01,595
- Mmm.
Good sandwiches.

288
00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:04,297
- Good sandwiches that I put
my heart and soul into.

289
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,567
- It's hard making
peanut butters.

290
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:12,939
your phone's ringing.

291
00:12:12,974 --> 00:12:14,774
- It's just devin.

292
00:12:14,809 --> 00:12:16,209
I'll call her back later.

293
00:12:16,243 --> 00:12:18,078
- You sure?
- Uh-huh.

294
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,180
We're having our romantic picnic
right now, okay?

295
00:12:20,214 --> 00:12:21,648
- Yeah, that's right.

296
00:12:21,682 --> 00:12:24,784
- Uh-uh. Wait.

297
00:12:24,819 --> 00:12:25,852
- Excuse me, miss.

298
00:12:25,886 --> 00:12:30,557
Can I get some service,
please?

299
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:33,760
Excuse me, miss?

300
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,929
Can I get some menus over here
and some service?

301
00:12:39,934 --> 00:12:41,534
Thank you.

302
00:12:41,569 --> 00:12:43,236
- I'm sorry.

303
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:45,105
Okay, vince, you really need
to go away.

304
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,473
- I can't get some food?
- No.

305
00:12:46,507 --> 00:12:47,907
It don't make no sense
you being here.

306
00:12:47,942 --> 00:12:49,209
- Why not?

307
00:12:49,243 --> 00:12:51,044
You know your dad got
the best ribs in town.

308
00:12:51,078 --> 00:12:53,613
- What you want?

309
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:55,281
- Hey, mr. Merriweather.

310
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,584
I was just talking
to your daughter jess.

311
00:12:57,618 --> 00:12:59,252
About to order some
of them baby back ribs.

312
00:12:59,286 --> 00:13:00,587
- Mm-hmm?

313
00:13:00,621 --> 00:13:02,022
Well, you can get that over
at the counter to go.

314
00:13:02,056 --> 00:13:04,724
- No, that's cool.
I was gon' sit here and eat it.

315
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:07,527
- Get your ass over
to the counter.

316
00:13:07,561 --> 00:13:11,097
- Yes, sir.

317
00:13:11,132 --> 00:13:12,232
Here.

318
00:13:12,266 --> 00:13:13,400
It was a pleasure talking
to you, jess.

319
00:13:13,434 --> 00:13:15,735
I'll see you around school.

320
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:24,878
- Hey, it's the girl
who loves her candy.

321
00:13:24,912 --> 00:13:27,113
Got you some gummy bears.

322
00:13:27,148 --> 00:13:29,516
- Okay, look...

323
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,718
Our little thing
the other night,

324
00:13:31,752 --> 00:13:33,520
That was a mistake,
okay?

325
00:13:33,554 --> 00:13:35,288
That was a big mistake.

326
00:13:35,322 --> 00:13:36,990
And I would really
appreciate it

327
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,292
If you didn't try to treat me
like a girlfriend or anything,

328
00:13:39,326 --> 00:13:40,794
And I don't need you
buying me stuff.

329
00:13:40,828 --> 00:13:42,362
I don't want anything
from you.

330
00:13:42,396 --> 00:13:43,630
Especially not for you
to talk about me

331
00:13:43,664 --> 00:13:44,931
To your little
football buddies.

332
00:13:44,965 --> 00:13:47,333
- I didn't say anything
to my football buddies.

333
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,502
- Yeah, I'll bet you didn't.

334
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:50,837
Just forget it.

335
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:53,106
We just don't have to talk
at all anymore, okay?

336
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,340
- Sorry.
I just--

337
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,809
I think you're cute
and I just

338
00:13:55,843 --> 00:13:59,312
Would really love to go
out again sometime, but...

339
00:13:59,346 --> 00:14:00,513
I must be, uh--

340
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,148
Yeah.
I don't know.

341
00:14:02,183 --> 00:14:07,153
Sorry.

342
00:14:08,622 --> 00:14:11,324
- Julie, I know that
you probably do not

343
00:14:11,358 --> 00:14:13,026
Think this is a big deal,
but I assure you

344
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,527
This is a gigantic deal.

345
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,863
You had best turn around from
wherever you are right now

346
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,532
And get yourself home,
and you answer the phone

347
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:22,335
When I call you!

348
00:14:23,471 --> 00:14:26,840
You are my favorite daughter.

349
00:14:26,874 --> 00:14:28,875
Be right back, sweetie.

350
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,115
- Five, six, seven, eight.

351
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:36,316
Wait, no.
You know what?

352
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,350
I think we should go--
because that would add--

353
00:14:37,384 --> 00:14:38,885
- Jess.
Jess.

354
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,520
No, come on.
Seriously, it's fine.

355
00:14:40,554 --> 00:14:42,155
- Is fine okay for tv?

356
00:14:42,189 --> 00:14:43,656
'cause if y'all okay
with fine,

357
00:14:43,691 --> 00:14:44,891
Then we can stop right now.

358
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:46,326
Come on.
Five, six, seven, eight.

359
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,628
All right, five, six,
seven, eight.

360
00:14:48,662 --> 00:14:52,065
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.

361
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,566
- Three, two, one.

362
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,301
- Bring it in, guys.
Let's go.

363
00:14:55,336 --> 00:14:57,570
here we go, here we go.

364
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:58,638
- Hey, listen up.

365
00:14:58,672 --> 00:15:00,106
Who can tell me
mcnulty's record?

366
00:15:00,141 --> 00:15:01,341
- Yeah, coach,
they never lost.

367
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,342
- That's right.
They haven't.

368
00:15:02,376 --> 00:15:03,710
But we're gonna
change that,

369
00:15:03,744 --> 00:15:04,878
And here's how we're gonna
do it, gentlemen.

370
00:15:04,912 --> 00:15:07,247
We're gonna play 11
on offense today,

371
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,082
But we are gonna
do 13 on defense,

372
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:11,684
Because if you can punch
one hole into 13,

373
00:15:11,719 --> 00:15:13,520
You damn well ought
to be able to punch

374
00:15:13,554 --> 00:15:14,721
2 holes into 11.

375
00:15:14,755 --> 00:15:16,523
Understood?

376
00:15:16,557 --> 00:15:18,024
Yes, sir.

377
00:15:18,058 --> 00:15:20,160
- We got tim and billy
coming over to help.

378
00:15:20,194 --> 00:15:21,394
- Ah, here we go.

379
00:15:21,428 --> 00:15:23,830
- You boys ever play
a couple state champions?

380
00:15:23,864 --> 00:15:25,165
- Here we go!

381
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,666
- Show 'em your ring, tim.

382
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,934
- All the guys in yellow
on defense,

383
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:29,102
Over there,
huddle 'em up.

384
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,037
Over here, offense.
- Let's go, boys!

385
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,105
Here we go!

386
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,306
Feel good!

387
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,241
We feel good!

388
00:15:35,276 --> 00:15:36,743
How you guys feel?

389
00:15:36,777 --> 00:15:38,044
- Let's go!
- Here we go!

390
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:39,479
Here we go!
Let's go!

391
00:15:39,513 --> 00:15:40,780
Let's go, d!

392
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:43,750
- Strong red, strong red,
strong red!

393
00:15:51,725 --> 00:15:53,660
- you was open on that one?

394
00:15:53,694 --> 00:15:55,361
- I got hit before
I even got the ball.

395
00:15:55,396 --> 00:15:56,729
- Guy's all over the place.

396
00:15:56,764 --> 00:15:58,097
So fast.

397
00:15:58,132 --> 00:16:00,233
- All right,
let's do it.

398
00:16:00,267 --> 00:16:02,402
- Let's go.

399
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,040
Oh!

400
00:16:07,074 --> 00:16:09,442
- yeah!

401
00:16:09,476 --> 00:16:10,944
- It's like playing against
a brick wall over here.

402
00:16:10,978 --> 00:16:12,011
Come on.
- I know.

403
00:16:12,046 --> 00:16:13,246
I can feel it.

404
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,447
- We're not ready for this.

405
00:16:14,481 --> 00:16:16,182
- Here we go.

406
00:16:18,319 --> 00:16:19,619
- Here we go.
Come on, come on, come on.

407
00:16:19,653 --> 00:16:22,422
- Go, go, go, go.

408
00:16:22,456 --> 00:16:24,224
Go, go, go, go.
Aww!

409
00:16:24,258 --> 00:16:26,025
Copeland, you got
to respond to that!

410
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,760
- They're getting there.

411
00:16:27,795 --> 00:16:29,095
They're getting there.
- Touch down!

412
00:16:29,129 --> 00:16:30,230
- Love it, love it.

413
00:16:30,264 --> 00:16:37,904
âTª âTª

414
00:16:37,938 --> 00:16:39,973
- âTª you've got a way âTª

415
00:16:40,007 --> 00:16:41,941
âTª to make my heart sing âTª

416
00:16:41,976 --> 00:16:43,810
- Seriously, I mean,
I'm telling you right now,

417
00:16:43,844 --> 00:16:46,746
If we had to play a game
tomorrow, I would be a madman.

418
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,948
- Okay, so here's what I want.
- Honestly I was running--

419
00:16:48,983 --> 00:16:50,483
- I want you guys to just stop
talking about football.

420
00:16:50,517 --> 00:16:51,985
- How's being pregnant?

421
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:53,586
- Oh, it's great, you know?

422
00:16:53,621 --> 00:16:54,787
I mean, she just thinks her
water's gonna break,

423
00:16:54,822 --> 00:16:55,788
Like, every 15 minutes,
but--

424
00:16:55,823 --> 00:16:57,757
- Really?
I mean, I know

425
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,959
You have the belly,
but not the baby,

426
00:16:59,994 --> 00:17:01,527
'cause she asked me what it was
like to be pregnant.

427
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,296
What you could do is you
could just thank me

428
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,597
For always being
your designated driver.

429
00:17:04,632 --> 00:17:06,933
- I do.
I thank you constantly.

430
00:17:06,967 --> 00:17:08,301
I thank you constantly, baby.
- Mm-hmm.

431
00:17:08,335 --> 00:17:09,869
- 'cause I love you.
- Mm-hmm.

432
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:10,870
- It's true.

433
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:12,672
What?

434
00:17:12,706 --> 00:17:14,774
- Y'all know what I miss?
- What?

435
00:17:14,808 --> 00:17:17,210
- Getting on that bull
and letting off some steam.

436
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:18,244
- I'd ride that bull.

437
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:19,412
- No, you shouldn't.

438
00:17:19,446 --> 00:17:20,446
- I would ride that bull.

439
00:17:20,481 --> 00:17:22,148
- Hey, lyla, not a good call.

440
00:17:22,182 --> 00:17:23,216
- It's totally a good call.

441
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,450
- No, it's not a good call.

442
00:17:24,485 --> 00:17:25,818
Don't get on the death ride.

443
00:17:25,853 --> 00:17:27,053
- I'm riding the bull.

444
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,187
- Yeah, you're riding the bull.

445
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:31,424
- What'd you just do?

446
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:32,425
- Amazing.

447
00:17:32,459 --> 00:17:33,660
- Can I go next?

448
00:17:33,694 --> 00:17:34,961
- Sure, little lady.

449
00:17:34,995 --> 00:17:37,730
- This might not end well.

450
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:40,533
- Oh, my god.

451
00:17:40,567 --> 00:17:42,168
- Whoo!
I'm ready!

452
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,674
- Whoa!

453
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,842
She's pretty good.

454
00:17:49,877 --> 00:17:52,278
- Ow!

455
00:17:52,313 --> 00:17:54,213
Whoo!

456
00:18:04,892 --> 00:18:05,959
- That's very smooth.

457
00:18:05,993 --> 00:18:08,194
- You missed me.

458
00:18:08,228 --> 00:18:10,229
- You have no idea.

459
00:18:18,272 --> 00:18:19,472
- Ll see you later.
- All right, buddy.

460
00:18:19,506 --> 00:18:21,040
- Landry!
- Bye.

461
00:18:21,075 --> 00:18:22,475
- Hey, landry.
- Hey.

462
00:18:22,509 --> 00:18:23,609
- How are you doing?

463
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,511
- I'm doing good.
- Good to see you.

464
00:18:25,546 --> 00:18:27,246
- Good to see you over here
at east dillon.

465
00:18:27,281 --> 00:18:28,581
- I know.

466
00:18:28,615 --> 00:18:30,783
Well, you know, I had to drop
off something for coach.

467
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,518
Rushing off to my school.

468
00:18:32,553 --> 00:18:34,220
- Right.

469
00:18:34,254 --> 00:18:36,155
- Hey, have you talked
to matt and jules

470
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,791
Since they've gone off
on their big trip to austin?

471
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,593
- No, not since they left.

472
00:18:40,627 --> 00:18:41,728
- Yeah.
- What?

473
00:18:41,762 --> 00:18:43,129
- Listen, I'm just
gonna be

474
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,398
Real straightforward
with you, landry.

475
00:18:45,432 --> 00:18:47,667
My daughter's awol
and I'm sick about it,

476
00:18:47,701 --> 00:18:50,336
And if you could shed
any light on where they are

477
00:18:50,371 --> 00:18:52,372
And when they're gonna be there,
anything like that,

478
00:18:52,406 --> 00:18:54,841
It would just be real--
real helpful to me.

479
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:56,376
- Well, I mean,
I don't know.

480
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:57,910
Obviously I don't know
their whole schedule...

481
00:18:57,945 --> 00:18:59,379
- You know, I--
well, just--

482
00:18:59,413 --> 00:19:02,348
- I think they were planning on
seeing the heartless bastards

483
00:19:02,383 --> 00:19:03,950
At emo's tomorrow night.

484
00:19:03,984 --> 00:19:05,318
- Okay, that's good to--

485
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:06,619
- Like 7:30 or 8:00
or something.

486
00:19:06,653 --> 00:19:08,121
But other than that, I don't--
- uh-huh.

487
00:19:08,155 --> 00:19:09,455
And you know where
they're staying

488
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:10,857
Or anything like that?

489
00:19:10,891 --> 00:19:12,692
- Are you going?
Are you gonna go visit?

490
00:19:12,726 --> 00:19:14,794
- No.
I don't--no.

491
00:19:14,828 --> 00:19:16,829
But I just--I'm a mother.

492
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:19,032
Um, all right, well,
I got to--

493
00:19:19,066 --> 00:19:20,800
I'll have to get over
to my school now, but--

494
00:19:20,834 --> 00:19:22,535
- Okay, well, it's--
- nice to see you.

495
00:19:22,569 --> 00:19:23,970
- It was good to see you.
- Okay.

496
00:19:24,004 --> 00:19:25,138
Thank you.

497
00:19:35,949 --> 00:19:38,351
- Hi.
Becky, right?

498
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:39,585
- Yeah.

499
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,953
- I'm lyla.

500
00:19:40,988 --> 00:19:42,155
- Yeah, I remember.

501
00:19:42,189 --> 00:19:43,656
- Is tim around?

502
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:45,625
- Oh, no.
I, um--I haven't seen him.

503
00:19:45,659 --> 00:19:48,127
- Okay.

504
00:19:48,162 --> 00:19:50,163
- So you're in college,
right?

505
00:19:50,197 --> 00:19:52,131
Is it great?

506
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:53,366
- Yeah.

507
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,468
It's pretty cool.

508
00:19:55,502 --> 00:19:57,036
Guess I've been a little
homesick lately.

509
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:59,772
- For dillon?

510
00:19:59,807 --> 00:20:01,941
- Yeah, I didn't expect
that either.

511
00:20:01,975 --> 00:20:03,643
- Did you come back
'cause you miss tim?

512
00:20:03,677 --> 00:20:08,014
- No.

513
00:20:08,048 --> 00:20:11,384
You know, I really don't know
what I'm doing here.

514
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:16,956
Um, you go away
to college and, uh...

515
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,991
You think you're getting over
the whole thing,

516
00:20:19,026 --> 00:20:21,627
'cause being away helps
with that.

517
00:20:21,662 --> 00:20:24,897
But...

518
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:29,135
Now I'm here
and here we are.

519
00:20:29,169 --> 00:20:30,837
- I'll tell tim
you stopped by.

520
00:20:34,741 --> 00:20:38,177
You're so lucky.

521
00:20:38,212 --> 00:20:40,213
So pretty.

522
00:20:50,057 --> 00:20:51,491
- This is the mcnulty film.

523
00:20:51,525 --> 00:20:52,758
I want y'all to watch
this together.

524
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:53,993
You understand?
- Yes, sir.

525
00:20:54,027 --> 00:20:57,063
- All right, good enough.

526
00:20:57,097 --> 00:20:58,397
Anything confusing about that?

527
00:20:58,432 --> 00:20:59,599
- Where?

528
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,334
- Wherever you can find
out to watch 'em.

529
00:21:01,368 --> 00:21:04,237
Would you step out of my way
so I can see the tv, please?

530
00:21:04,271 --> 00:21:08,341
- Okay.

531
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:11,043
Why do we have
to get killed on tv?

532
00:21:11,078 --> 00:21:12,245
- I don't know.

533
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:13,346
I don't know
what we're gonna do.

534
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:17,416
- Gotta do something.

535
00:21:17,451 --> 00:21:19,418
- Oh.

536
00:21:19,453 --> 00:21:21,120
Look who it is.

537
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:22,388
- Look who it is.

538
00:21:22,422 --> 00:21:23,723
- What are you guys doing?

539
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:27,527
- Watching game tape?
- What's it look like, genius?

540
00:21:27,561 --> 00:21:30,396
- In sears?
- Funny.

541
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,465
- Yeah, I'm surprised you
haven't stolen one of these.

542
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:35,401
- Dude, shut up.

543
00:21:35,435 --> 00:21:36,536
- Got a problem?

544
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:40,473
- Nah, but I can get one
real quick.

545
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,441
- Can I help you boys?

546
00:21:42,476 --> 00:21:44,010
- Yeah.
- You know what?

547
00:21:44,044 --> 00:21:45,344
Why don't you get the hell out
of my department

548
00:21:45,379 --> 00:21:46,512
And the hell out
of my store?

549
00:21:46,547 --> 00:21:47,747
- For what?

550
00:21:47,781 --> 00:21:49,148
- 'cause I'm just
one jackass comment

551
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:50,883
Away from doing
some serious damage,

552
00:21:50,918 --> 00:21:54,353
And if that happens,
I would lose my job...

553
00:21:54,388 --> 00:21:56,088
And I love my job.

554
00:21:56,123 --> 00:21:58,124
You get me?

555
00:21:58,158 --> 00:21:59,358
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

556
00:21:59,393 --> 00:22:01,360
- Let's go, man.

557
00:22:01,395 --> 00:22:03,996
- Yeah.

558
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,231
- From the east side.

559
00:22:05,265 --> 00:22:07,567
Coach, I didn't even know.
What's up?

560
00:22:07,601 --> 00:22:09,001
- Down.

561
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,937
Look for the gaps.
- Okay.

562
00:22:10,971 --> 00:22:12,905
- Yes, sir.

563
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:17,843
- Matt, get off the bedspread.

564
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,278
- What?
- They don't wash it.

565
00:22:19,313 --> 00:22:20,413
There's, like,
bugs that live in it.

566
00:22:20,447 --> 00:22:21,714
Get off, off, off,
off, off, off, off.

567
00:22:21,748 --> 00:22:23,082
- Okay, sorry, sorry.

568
00:22:23,116 --> 00:22:25,351
- It's getting--get some
kind of disease.

569
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:26,786
- Jesus.

570
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,454
- There.
Now you can sit down.

571
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:33,492
- Would you like to dance?

572
00:22:33,527 --> 00:22:35,428
- Are you being serious?

573
00:22:35,462 --> 00:22:40,066
- Yeah, it's pretty music.

574
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,801
- Wow. Mr. Romance.

575
00:22:41,835 --> 00:22:43,803
- Shut up.
Stop ruining the moment.

576
00:22:43,837 --> 00:22:45,137
- I am not ruining the moment.

577
00:22:45,172 --> 00:22:47,406
- Shut up and enjoy it.

578
00:22:47,441 --> 00:22:52,178
- We're in a hotel dancing.

579
00:22:52,212 --> 00:22:53,246
- Whoo.

580
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,114
- This is real romantical.

581
00:22:55,148 --> 00:22:56,215
- Yeah and it's beautiful.

582
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,750
Look, we're in austin.

583
00:22:57,784 --> 00:22:59,785
- It's the capital.

584
00:23:07,027 --> 00:23:09,528
- Hi.
- Hi.

585
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:17,069
Thanks for coming back.

586
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,875
- You're welcome.

587
00:23:28,382 --> 00:23:31,417
- Now I can't believe
my son

588
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:33,619
Gon' be on tv.

589
00:23:33,654 --> 00:23:37,156
- Yeah, your son's gon' get his
butt whooped on tv too.

590
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:40,960
- Man, you don't know that.

591
00:23:40,994 --> 00:23:45,264
Oh, I got to find something
to wear.

592
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:46,799
- Wear for what?

593
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:48,801
- To the game.

594
00:23:48,835 --> 00:23:49,969
- You don't got
to come all the way up

595
00:23:50,003 --> 00:23:52,171
To mcnulty just
to see me lose.

596
00:23:52,205 --> 00:23:54,807
- Well, um...

597
00:23:54,841 --> 00:23:58,044
Selena said she'd drop me off.

598
00:23:58,078 --> 00:24:01,781
Look, I need to see you play.

599
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:04,884
- I do.

600
00:24:04,918 --> 00:24:08,187
- Okay.

601
00:24:08,221 --> 00:24:10,189
- Look, I won't--

602
00:24:10,223 --> 00:24:12,325
I won't make no scenes
or nothing.

603
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:14,627
You know, I'll be cleaned up.

604
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:17,396
- I'm going
to austin tomorrow.

605
00:24:17,431 --> 00:24:19,131
- You're what?

606
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,100
- I'm going to find our daughter
in austin tomorrow.

607
00:24:21,134 --> 00:24:22,435
- Now listen, babe--

608
00:24:22,469 --> 00:24:24,704
- Because I don't care
that she is 17 years old.

609
00:24:24,738 --> 00:24:26,605
She bald-faced lied to us

610
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,407
And she went there
without our permission.

611
00:24:28,442 --> 00:24:29,675
We told her not to go.

612
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:31,777
We expressly said,
"do not go to austin,"

613
00:24:31,812 --> 00:24:34,046
And she went off
without telling us.

614
00:24:34,081 --> 00:24:36,549
Even though we told her not
to go, she's there.

615
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:38,284
- You can't go down--find her
in a music festival.

616
00:24:38,318 --> 00:24:40,586
- She's not answered one
single one of my phone calls.

617
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,388
I have no idea where she is.

618
00:24:42,422 --> 00:24:44,123
She has not called us.

619
00:24:44,157 --> 00:24:45,791
She could be--

620
00:24:45,826 --> 00:24:48,427
I have no idea if she's okay.

621
00:24:48,462 --> 00:24:49,862
I am concerned.

622
00:24:49,896 --> 00:24:52,898
I can't think
of another thing right now.

623
00:24:52,933 --> 00:24:55,167
Can't focus on anything,
so I'm just gonna

624
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,936
Go to austin
and I'm going to find her.

625
00:25:01,508 --> 00:25:03,676
- And I support
your decision 100%.

626
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:06,779
- Thank you, babe.

627
00:25:06,813 --> 00:25:09,448
It's so darn selfish.

628
00:25:09,483 --> 00:25:11,617
- But more importantly--

629
00:25:11,651 --> 00:25:12,952
More importantly,
riggins rigs--

630
00:25:12,986 --> 00:25:14,687
Yeah, granted,
it's not doing so well.

631
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:15,755
I understand that.

632
00:25:15,789 --> 00:25:17,123
Hence me in the trailer
right now.

633
00:25:17,157 --> 00:25:18,290
That will change.

634
00:25:18,325 --> 00:25:22,061
So give me six months,
a year.

635
00:25:22,095 --> 00:25:23,629
He's got his kid and
all this kind of stuff.

636
00:25:23,663 --> 00:25:24,697
It's gonna get busy.

637
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:26,265
I'm pitching away,
doing my thing.

638
00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:27,933
Handing out cards.
All this kind of stuff.

639
00:25:27,968 --> 00:25:29,301
It's gonna get super busy.

640
00:25:29,336 --> 00:25:30,736
I'll be under that car
all the time.

641
00:25:30,771 --> 00:25:33,839
That's where you come in,
miss garrity.

642
00:25:33,874 --> 00:25:35,674
We're gonna need someone
to manage it

643
00:25:35,709 --> 00:25:38,511
When it gets, like,
just super busy.

644
00:25:38,545 --> 00:25:40,379
I mean, granted, yeah,
it's a simple life,

645
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:42,181
But, I mean, that--
it's kind of a great life.

646
00:25:42,215 --> 00:25:43,282
- That's your pitch?

647
00:25:43,316 --> 00:25:44,650
- Yeah.

648
00:25:44,684 --> 00:25:46,519
- Wow.
- Yeah.

649
00:25:46,553 --> 00:25:49,088
Take that.

650
00:25:49,122 --> 00:25:50,656
That's a hard one
to walk away from.

651
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:53,192
- So don't.

652
00:25:53,226 --> 00:25:56,462
- Tim--
- I'm serious.

653
00:26:03,203 --> 00:26:04,703
- What do you want?

654
00:26:04,738 --> 00:26:06,238
- You.

655
00:26:16,817 --> 00:26:18,417
- What else do you want?

656
00:26:23,824 --> 00:26:25,825
- You.

657
00:26:51,184 --> 00:26:52,651
- Hey, what's wrong?

658
00:26:52,686 --> 00:26:54,386
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

659
00:26:54,421 --> 00:26:57,189
Hey, hey, hey.
What's going on?

660
00:26:57,224 --> 00:26:58,891
- Why would she do that?

661
00:26:58,925 --> 00:27:01,560
Scare us to death like that?

662
00:27:01,595 --> 00:27:04,230
- I trust julie.

663
00:27:04,264 --> 00:27:06,165
I trust matt.

664
00:27:06,199 --> 00:27:08,968
And I know that she's safe
anywhere, all right?

665
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,736
- I don't know that.

666
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:12,571
I don't know at all
that she's safe.

667
00:27:12,606 --> 00:27:15,541
She has not returned
one single phone call.

668
00:27:15,575 --> 00:27:17,877
I don't know why
she would do that.

669
00:27:17,911 --> 00:27:20,112
- Because she's 17 years old.
That's why.

670
00:27:20,146 --> 00:27:23,616
- Just breaks my heart.

671
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:25,751
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

672
00:27:28,121 --> 00:27:29,755
The more we make
her try to stay,

673
00:27:29,789 --> 00:27:31,390
The more she's gonna stray.

674
00:27:31,424 --> 00:27:32,458
You know that.

675
00:27:32,492 --> 00:27:33,692
- I know, but I hate it.

676
00:27:33,727 --> 00:27:36,862
I don't want her to go.

677
00:27:36,897 --> 00:27:40,799
But I know
she's gonna go and...

678
00:27:40,834 --> 00:27:44,236
I don't want her to.

679
00:27:44,271 --> 00:27:47,239
- You're not going then?

680
00:27:47,274 --> 00:27:48,507
- To austin?

681
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:51,076
- Mm-hmm.

682
00:27:51,111 --> 00:27:54,046
- No.

683
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,315
Seems kind of silly,
I guess.

684
00:27:56,349 --> 00:27:58,951
I'm just gonna beat her ass
when she gets home.

685
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:07,426
- Mm.

686
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,494
- Hello?

687
00:28:08,528 --> 00:28:11,263
- Hey, matt.
How you doing?

688
00:28:11,298 --> 00:28:12,298
- Yeah, no, it's good.

689
00:28:12,332 --> 00:28:13,766
Um, we saw him
yesterday

690
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,468
And we're about to go see
the heartless bastards tonight.

691
00:28:16,503 --> 00:28:18,237
- That sounds like
a lot of fun.

692
00:28:18,271 --> 00:28:21,540
Um, just a--kind of a fyi.

693
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:25,044
Miss taylor kind of cornered me
at school yesterday

694
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,946
And started drilling me
with all these questions

695
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:29,048
About where you
and julie might be.

696
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:31,951
- Wait, what?

697
00:28:31,985 --> 00:28:33,719
- And I kind of panicked
and told her

698
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:36,388
That y'all were going to
the heartless bastards tonight,

699
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,324
Which, now thinking back,
I might not should have done.

700
00:28:38,358 --> 00:28:39,725
- What?

701
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,093
- Just wanted to give you
the heads-up.

702
00:28:41,127 --> 00:28:42,962
It's probably fine.
- Wait, she doesn't know--

703
00:28:42,996 --> 00:28:45,798
- I'm sure she's not gonna come
to austin or anything.

704
00:28:45,832 --> 00:28:47,733
But I just wanted
to let you know.

705
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,268
So there it is.

706
00:28:49,302 --> 00:28:51,136
- So she doesn't know
that she's in austin with me?

707
00:28:51,171 --> 00:28:52,404
- Oh, great.

708
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,106
Well, I think I'm gonna go
'cause I just

709
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,541
Let another cat out
of the bag.

710
00:28:55,575 --> 00:28:57,209
I guess I'll talk to you later.
Bye.

711
00:28:57,243 --> 00:28:58,744
- Thanks.

712
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:00,613
- Aren't you ready?

713
00:29:00,647 --> 00:29:05,985
- Um...You lied
to your parents?

714
00:29:06,019 --> 00:29:08,354
- I didn't lie
to my parents, matt.

715
00:29:08,388 --> 00:29:09,755
- Okay, well,
'cause that was landry

716
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:12,091
And he said that your mom was
interrogating landry

717
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,425
About where you were.

718
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,027
- Yeah, well, I told them
I was gonna be in austin.

719
00:29:15,061 --> 00:29:16,362
I left them a message.

720
00:29:16,396 --> 00:29:18,030
- Oh, you left them a message
that you were in austin.

721
00:29:18,064 --> 00:29:19,365
That's good.

722
00:29:19,399 --> 00:29:20,432
- Look, you're blowing it
out of proportion.

723
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:21,667
It's--matt, it's rlly--

724
00:29:21,701 --> 00:29:23,569
- No, it is a big deal,
'cause you know what?

725
00:29:23,603 --> 00:29:25,070
I actually care what your
parents think about me.

726
00:29:25,105 --> 00:29:26,472
I really don't want them
to hate me,

727
00:29:26,506 --> 00:29:27,773
Which is what's gonna happen
if they think

728
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:29,208
That I just ran away
to austin with you.

729
00:29:29,242 --> 00:29:31,210
- I told them where I was
gonna be and I'm sorry!

730
00:29:31,244 --> 00:29:33,012
I did this whole thing
to make you happy, okay?

731
00:29:33,046 --> 00:29:35,180
I bought the music festival
tickets so you could get out

732
00:29:35,215 --> 00:29:36,949
Of dillon, because I know
how much you hate dillon.

733
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:38,250
- I don't--I don't hate dillon.

734
00:29:38,284 --> 00:29:40,185
I don't know what
you're talking about.

735
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,353
- Look, you hate dillon.

736
00:29:41,388 --> 00:29:42,721
You only stay there
because of me

737
00:29:42,756 --> 00:29:44,456
And maybe for once I don't
want the responsibility

738
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,992
Of you having
to stay in dillon.

739
00:29:53,733 --> 00:29:57,069
- Look, hey.
I'm sorry, okay?

740
00:29:57,103 --> 00:30:00,873
I didn't--

741
00:30:00,907 --> 00:30:04,677
I didn't mean--I didn't mean
to freak out.

742
00:30:04,711 --> 00:30:09,048
So let's just go see this
concert, all right?

743
00:30:09,082 --> 00:30:11,383
- I'm sorry too.
I didn't mean to yell.

744
00:30:11,418 --> 00:30:16,088
- No, that's--it's fine.
It's fine.

745
00:30:16,122 --> 00:30:18,123
- Yeah.

746
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:35,708
âTª âTª

747
00:30:40,914 --> 00:30:45,117
- Folks, we are just one hour
away from kickoff.

748
00:30:45,151 --> 00:30:48,554
Mcnulty's rolling in
an undefeated, top-ranked team.

749
00:30:48,588 --> 00:30:49,922
Versus the east dillon lions,

750
00:30:49,956 --> 00:30:52,491
A team that has yet
to name a quarterback.

751
00:30:52,525 --> 00:30:54,727
Coach taylor's put this team
together with spit

752
00:30:54,761 --> 00:30:57,429
And scotch tape, and tonight,
this monumental mismatch

753
00:30:57,464 --> 00:31:00,132
Is gonna be captured
on television.

754
00:31:00,166 --> 00:31:02,468
It's a beautiful night
for football, folks.

755
00:31:02,502 --> 00:31:04,203
Vince howard in shotgun.

756
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:05,971
- Let's go, o!

757
00:31:06,005 --> 00:31:07,773
- Cafferty goes in motion.
There's the snap.

758
00:31:07,807 --> 00:31:09,575
It's a speed sweep,
going left.

759
00:31:09,609 --> 00:31:11,176
Oh! Howard keeps it
going right.

760
00:31:11,211 --> 00:31:13,112
- Got a lane.
This could be something, folks.

761
00:31:13,146 --> 00:31:14,513
Oh, and he trucks
the quarterback.

762
00:31:15,882 --> 00:31:21,286
- First down to the 41.
Roll lions.

763
00:31:21,321 --> 00:31:22,688
- Coach taylor's moving
luke cafferty

764
00:31:22,722 --> 00:31:23,789
Under center for the snap.

765
00:31:23,823 --> 00:31:26,792
It's a little speed draw.

766
00:31:26,826 --> 00:31:29,294
Lanes are up the middle.
Got some room.

767
00:31:29,329 --> 00:31:31,764
Oh, nice run by luke cafferty

768
00:31:31,798 --> 00:31:32,931
The lions, believe it or not,

769
00:31:32,966 --> 00:31:34,800
Got a little something-something
going, folks.

770
00:31:34,834 --> 00:31:36,368
No one saw this coming,

771
00:31:36,402 --> 00:31:41,807
But this could turn out to be
one hell of a football game.

772
00:31:45,712 --> 00:31:47,579
East dillon lions
in the red zone.

773
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:50,516
This could be big, folks.
Howard at quarterback.

774
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:52,184
There's the snap.

775
00:31:52,218 --> 00:31:53,285
Howard takes off.

776
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:55,053
On a little speed draw up
the middle.

777
00:31:55,088 --> 00:31:56,155
Got a little room.

778
00:31:56,189 --> 00:32:00,325
This kid's got something.

779
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,394
Oh, my goodness.
A touchdown, east dillon lions!

780
00:32:02,428 --> 00:32:03,662
Touchdown!

781
00:32:03,696 --> 00:32:06,198
East scores, and that
is the first touchdown

782
00:32:06,232 --> 00:32:08,967
Mcnulty has given up
in four games.

783
00:32:09,002 --> 00:32:11,336
It looks like
the east dillon lions

784
00:32:11,371 --> 00:32:12,738
Have found an identity,
folks.

785
00:32:12,772 --> 00:32:16,809
And quite possibly a quarterback
that is the real deal.

786
00:32:16,843 --> 00:32:18,477
- Yeah!

787
00:32:18,511 --> 00:32:20,679
- Here we go.
Late in the second half.

788
00:32:20,713 --> 00:32:22,548
These lions have battled
these mavericks

789
00:32:22,582 --> 00:32:23,882
All night long,

790
00:32:23,917 --> 00:32:25,684
And they are just seven
points away

791
00:32:25,718 --> 00:32:27,085
From tying this game up--

792
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,987
Something no one,
including yours truly,

793
00:32:29,022 --> 00:32:31,089
Thought was even remotely
possible.

794
00:32:32,525 --> 00:32:35,227
- Good job!
Good job!

795
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:40,499
- Howard takes the snap.

796
00:32:40,533 --> 00:32:42,768
He rolls left.
Pressure coming.

797
00:32:42,802 --> 00:32:45,704
- Upfield, go!

798
00:32:45,738 --> 00:32:49,074
- This could be big, folks.

799
00:32:49,108 --> 00:32:51,510
Inside the ten-yard line.

800
00:32:51,544 --> 00:32:52,644
First down, lions.

801
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,381
- Get your ass up.
Let's go!

802
00:32:56,416 --> 00:32:58,483
- Hey, hey, hey!

803
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,352
Let's go, let's go.

804
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:08,927
Howard takes the snap.

805
00:33:08,962 --> 00:33:10,229
- Right there, right there,
right there!

806
00:33:10,263 --> 00:33:13,765
- Under pressure.
Great spin move.

807
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,268
Howard trying to make a play.

808
00:33:16,302 --> 00:33:18,036
He's gonna have to get rid
of the ball!

809
00:33:18,071 --> 00:33:20,873
Oh, and he gets pasted,
in the back field,

810
00:33:20,907 --> 00:33:22,541
The clock winds out,

811
00:33:22,575 --> 00:33:25,210
And the upset is not to be,
folks.

812
00:33:25,245 --> 00:33:26,378
- Get off me, man.

813
00:33:26,412 --> 00:33:28,881
We have seen a team emerge
tonight,

814
00:33:28,915 --> 00:33:31,917
Lead by a young quarterback,
vince howard,

815
00:33:31,951 --> 00:33:33,619
The rising star of the east
dillon lions.

816
00:33:33,653 --> 00:33:35,020
- Hey, let's go.
Bring it in.

817
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:36,355
Bring it in. Let's go.

818
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:37,522
- Here we go.

819
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:40,359
- Come on, fellas.
Let's go.

820
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:41,627
Hey, listen to me.
Listen, everyone.

821
00:33:41,661 --> 00:33:44,663
Listen up right now.

822
00:33:44,697 --> 00:33:46,765
Every single person
out here--

823
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:50,235
Every single person out here
respects you fellas.

824
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:52,337
Every one.
I respect you.

825
00:33:52,372 --> 00:33:54,039
You need to respect yourselves.

826
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:56,675
Hell of a job.
Hell of a job.

827
00:33:56,709 --> 00:33:58,744
Take that with you,
carry it,

828
00:33:58,778 --> 00:34:01,046
And we're gonna
build on it.

829
00:34:04,183 --> 00:34:08,186
- âTª I want to stay âTª

830
00:34:08,221 --> 00:34:11,490
âTª out here in the sun âTª

831
00:34:11,524 --> 00:34:13,892
âTª a while âTª

832
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:16,228
âTª and I saw âTª

833
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:18,730
âTª I saw the wide old world âTª

834
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:20,832
- Hey, do you want to leave?

835
00:34:20,867 --> 00:34:22,100
- No, they just started playing.

836
00:34:22,135 --> 00:34:23,101
Let's finish the set.

837
00:34:23,136 --> 00:34:28,540
- No, do you want me
to leave?

838
00:34:28,574 --> 00:34:30,008
Maybe you were right.

839
00:34:30,043 --> 00:34:31,910
I mean, maybe I should have
left already.

840
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:35,247
Do you even want me to stay?

841
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:37,783
- Of course I want you
to stay!

842
00:34:37,817 --> 00:34:40,018
I was just--I was saying
stupid things.

843
00:34:40,053 --> 00:34:42,120
I'm sorry!
I love you, okay?

844
00:34:42,155 --> 00:34:43,822
I'm sorry!
I was being stupid!

845
00:34:43,856 --> 00:34:45,223
Don't think about it,
okay?

846
00:34:45,258 --> 00:34:47,459
- Okay.

847
00:34:47,493 --> 00:34:50,996
- I love you!

848
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,831
- I love you.

849
00:34:52,865 --> 00:34:58,103
- âTª out into âTª

850
00:34:58,137 --> 00:35:01,206
âTª out into âTª

851
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,408
âTª out into âTª

852
00:35:03,443 --> 00:35:07,579
âTª the world âTª

853
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:32,371
- Morning.

854
00:35:32,405 --> 00:35:34,406
- Morning.

855
00:35:54,093 --> 00:35:56,561
- Good-bye, lyla garrity.

856
00:36:01,401 --> 00:36:03,902
- Good-bye.

857
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:58,323
- Really cool festival.
Thank you.

858
00:36:58,357 --> 00:37:01,326
- I'm glad you had
a good time.

859
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,362
It was nice just
to get away with you.

860
00:37:19,412 --> 00:37:21,980
- I love you, julie.

861
00:37:22,014 --> 00:37:24,783
- I love you, matty.

862
00:37:30,056 --> 00:37:33,024
I, um--

863
00:37:33,059 --> 00:37:36,228
I better go.

864
00:37:36,262 --> 00:37:38,263
- Yeah.

865
00:37:42,535 --> 00:37:47,439
I'll see you later.

866
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:49,474
- Yeah.

867
00:38:14,901 --> 00:38:17,269
- That better have been
a great concert, babe.

868
00:38:17,303 --> 00:38:20,739
- I'm sorry.

869
00:38:20,773 --> 00:38:24,342
- Well, we have been
worried sick.

870
00:38:24,377 --> 00:38:27,078
- Sorry.

871
00:38:27,113 --> 00:38:29,114
I'm sorry.

872
00:38:33,252 --> 00:38:35,453
- What happened, hon?
Did something happen?

873
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:40,892
I think he's leaving.

874
00:38:51,304 --> 00:38:54,072
- Okay.

875
00:38:54,106 --> 00:38:56,107
It's okay.

876
00:39:01,447 --> 00:39:02,914
- That's good.

877
00:39:02,949 --> 00:39:05,116
That's better.
- Is it better?

878
00:39:05,151 --> 00:39:06,751
Let me move these
and you watch and see

879
00:39:06,786 --> 00:39:08,720
If those lines come off.

880
00:39:08,754 --> 00:39:10,455
Do you really think
we need a new tv?

881
00:39:10,489 --> 00:39:11,790
Look, this is working
just fine.

882
00:39:11,824 --> 00:39:14,926
- No, I mean, it might be
something to invest in.

883
00:39:14,961 --> 00:39:16,261
- Well--
- that's--

884
00:39:16,295 --> 00:39:17,696
- Ooh, that is--
go back.

885
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,798
Let's watch that channel,
'cause it looks better.

886
00:39:19,832 --> 00:39:21,967
I don't really care.
Okay.

887
00:39:22,001 --> 00:39:23,935
And I guess we could think
about getting a new tv.

888
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:26,571
- Lorraine,
you'd be shocked.

889
00:39:26,606 --> 00:39:28,406
- Would we want to get
a bigger screen, you think?

890
00:39:28,441 --> 00:39:29,674
- Yeah.
- Really?

891
00:39:49,462 --> 00:39:51,463
- How's lyla?

892
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,501
- Gone.

893
00:40:01,574 --> 00:40:05,443
- Do you have a broken heart?

894
00:40:05,478 --> 00:40:09,447
- I don't know.

895
00:40:09,482 --> 00:40:11,483
- Is she the love of your life?

896
00:40:27,333 --> 00:40:28,800
Maybe there's more
than one soul mate

897
00:40:28,834 --> 00:40:31,936
For everybody, you know?

898
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:34,606
'cause, like, say I'm born
in texas, right?

899
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,243
And my soul mate's born all
the way over in sri lanka.

900
00:40:38,277 --> 00:40:41,446
That seems randomly unfair.

901
00:40:45,051 --> 00:40:47,786
It only makes sense that there
would be more than one.

902
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,321
You know,
'cause you have your first,

903
00:40:49,355 --> 00:40:54,392
And it's new, and you
feel things that you never

904
00:40:54,427 --> 00:40:58,196
Thought you'd feel
and they break your heart.

905
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:02,967
Then you cry about it
and you're sad over it...

906
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:06,504
And then you meet someone else.

907
00:41:06,539 --> 00:41:09,607
And for that time,
they're your new soul mate,

908
00:41:09,642 --> 00:41:15,180
Because they made you feel
things the other one couldn't.

909
00:41:15,214 --> 00:41:17,482
And then they break your heart.

910
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:19,718
- Becky...

911
00:41:19,752 --> 00:41:25,623
- Yeah?

912
00:41:25,658 --> 00:41:27,659
- Shut up.

913
00:41:32,465 --> 00:41:34,466
Please?

914
00:41:39,472 --> 00:41:49,440
