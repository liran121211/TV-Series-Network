1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,919
Pack up your stuff. Starting tomorrow,
you're gonna go to East Dillon High.

2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:07,214
- Kind of looking for a place.
- I do have this trailer.

3
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:09,300
I'm gonna give my daughter a call.

4
00:00:10,327 --> 00:00:11,510
Don't you scare her!

5
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:15,640
I'm your new intern.

6
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:18,309
I've got a bunch of crap in here,
I need you to start moving it.

7
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:20,645
Why did you forfeit the game?
You just quit on us?

8
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:23,022
I've got shame
and I apologize to you.

9
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,232
Who wants to finish this fight?

10
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:28,069
Let's finish it!
Let's finish it!

11
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:40,950
Hey, listen!

12
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,834
Ten of you are gonna push the car.
Once we get out there,

13
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:46,189
the rest of you hold the helmets
and collect the money.

14
00:00:46,314 --> 00:00:48,506
Be careful, don't get
your feet run over.

15
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:51,008
- Any questions?
- Matter of fact, I do.

16
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,427
- What is it, Tinker?
- Why are we pushing this damn car?

17
00:00:53,792 --> 00:00:55,012
One, watch your language.

18
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,349
Two, next time, I want whatever that
is on your upper lip shaved off.

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,685
And I'll tell you
why we're pushing the car,

20
00:01:00,933 --> 00:01:03,145
because
it's a fun football fundraiser.

21
00:01:03,372 --> 00:01:07,608
And we're gonna have fun, so we're gonna
put smiles on our faces right about now.

22
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:10,614
Team comes out, town comes out,
money gets exchanged.

23
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:12,363
It's a good thing. Understood?

24
00:01:12,613 --> 00:01:13,614
Got it, Coach!

25
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:15,574
Let's be kind
and courteous out there.

26
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,201
<i>Hello, neighborhood!</i>

27
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,619
<i>We're the Lions!</i>

28
00:01:21,724 --> 00:01:23,133
<i>Let's hear it, guys!</i>

29
00:01:25,457 --> 00:01:28,355
Even at church, everyone is
really not being nice to me

30
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,339
about this whole
Luke Cafferty thing.

31
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,084
That's our congregation.

32
00:01:32,442 --> 00:01:34,892
All sweet and holy
inside the church,

33
00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:37,516
then as soon as
they get out the door,

34
00:01:37,924 --> 00:01:40,725
- bitchy and judgmental.
- Well, welcome to the world, honey.

35
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:42,803
It's not gonna be my world.

36
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:44,353
What isn't?

37
00:01:44,846 --> 00:01:47,156
Going to church
with a bunch of hypocrites.

38
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,651
Hypocrites are everywhere.
It has nothing to do with church.

39
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:53,487
That's no way to think about it.
There's always gonna be some bad apples,

40
00:01:54,107 --> 00:01:56,615
but church is about you and God...

41
00:01:57,221 --> 00:01:59,869
So if it's just about me and God,
why can't I just worship at home?

42
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:02,913
I mean, I think that church
is also about community

43
00:02:03,475 --> 00:02:06,525
and family and you know,
there's just a lot to it.

44
00:02:07,803 --> 00:02:10,463
<i>We need your quarters,
your dollar bills,</i>

45
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:13,716
<i>your good wishes
in monetary fashion!</i>

46
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,134
<i>Let's hear it, boys!</i>

47
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,595
Not feeling love out there.
You feeling love?

48
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:18,963
Tink, shut up,

49
00:02:19,413 --> 00:02:22,718
stop sweating on me
and push this piece of junk, okay?

50
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:26,854
<i>We got forty bucks, people!
Thank you, good people of the street!</i>

51
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:29,482
Good to see ya!
Thank you very much!

52
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,775
Thank you very much!

53
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:32,526
<i>We are the East Dillon Lions!</i>

54
00:02:33,058 --> 00:02:34,814
<i>Feed us! Feed us!</i>

55
00:02:35,847 --> 00:02:37,239
- I'm out.
- What do you mean?

56
00:02:37,571 --> 00:02:39,241
- I'm out of money.
- What do you mean?

57
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,766
- I'm out of money.
- Listen to me.

58
00:02:42,474 --> 00:02:44,330
It's all I got left.
That's about a 100 bucks.

59
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,415
Don't give it all to one person.
Spread it out.

60
00:02:46,846 --> 00:02:50,211
- I'm trying, some are taking it.
- Give it to people who don't take it.

61
00:02:50,676 --> 00:02:53,798
<i>Look at these boys
pushing this car for ten miles!</i>

62
00:03:03,341 --> 00:03:04,941
There's your tricycle.

63
00:03:06,026 --> 00:03:07,812
- What?
- The tricycle!

64
00:03:10,133 --> 00:03:11,283
That's great.

65
00:03:11,527 --> 00:03:14,819
I need you to drive me to Clearwater
on Tuesday. I need to pick up some metal

66
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:16,821
so I can finish this piece of crap.

67
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:19,497
Why do you call
everything you work on crap?

68
00:03:19,622 --> 00:03:21,199
Because it is all crap.

69
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,285
I call the Mona Lisa crap.

70
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,371
In fact, the Mona Lisa is crap.

71
00:03:25,822 --> 00:03:28,122
There are better things I call crap.

72
00:03:30,618 --> 00:03:32,002
Clearwater is 200 miles away.

73
00:03:32,505 --> 00:03:33,671
- Just about.
- Right.

74
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:36,294
And I got a shift I gotta do so...

75
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,251
I mean, I can't take the whole day
and chauffeur you up there.

76
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,263
You're here to learn about art
from an artist!

77
00:03:43,536 --> 00:03:47,142
You can't take a day off because
you got a shift to deliver pizza?!

78
00:03:56,549 --> 00:03:58,814
We already have uniforms.
Why do we need new ones?

79
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:01,162
- Because I burned the uniforms.
- Taylor...

80
00:04:01,749 --> 00:04:04,118
I burned them. That's what you do.
They were damn 30 years old.

81
00:04:04,977 --> 00:04:07,658
This is not like I just burned them
for no reason.

82
00:04:08,015 --> 00:04:10,233
You end the old cycle,
you start the new, Levi.

83
00:04:10,358 --> 00:04:12,293
You know, you get rid of the past.

84
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:14,407
Fact of the matter is
the team and I we went out

85
00:04:14,538 --> 00:04:16,911
and we made up a good amount
of money, it's just that...

86
00:04:17,036 --> 00:04:19,049
Now we're just a little shy
of what we need

87
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:22,542
and all I'm asking is you
and the school is, you know...

88
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:25,115
if you'd help us with the downpayment.
We can pay for the rest.

89
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,558
I don't think you understand
the financial situation here.

90
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:30,329
We ain't close to talking about
more money for football.

91
00:04:30,454 --> 00:04:32,771
Levi, it's expensive starting up
a new football program...

92
00:04:33,114 --> 00:04:35,816
Starting up a new football program
is a little premature.

93
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:39,528
Let's see if we can finish up some games
before we start writing checks.

94
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:41,347
What is that supposed to mean?

95
00:04:41,472 --> 00:04:44,116
If you can't finish games,
I can't keep this program going.

96
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:45,701
Students are getting hurt.

97
00:04:45,987 --> 00:04:48,996
I don't want no jokes down
at the school board meetings. I'm tired.

98
00:04:49,611 --> 00:04:52,200
Either you turn it around
or we're gonna shut it down.

99
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:55,044
What do you mean?
You're gonna shut down the program?

100
00:04:55,747 --> 00:04:57,630
You weren't even supposed
to take this job!

101
00:04:58,124 --> 00:04:59,381
Or to be here.

102
00:04:59,683 --> 00:05:02,433
So you're the only
that didn't get the joke.

103
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,760

106
00:06:03,895 --> 00:06:06,073
Morning! I made you toast.

107
00:06:06,972 --> 00:06:07,992
Are you serious?

108
00:06:09,735 --> 00:06:10,869
It's worth it, eat it.

109
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:12,621
What time is it?

110
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:16,458
Morning. And since you're up, anyways,
can you give me a ride to school?

111
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,921
Come on. Put some pants on.
Watch your head. Watch your head!

112
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:24,221
Hurry up!

113
00:06:24,446 --> 00:06:26,093
I'll be waiting in the truck.

114
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,904
Here you go, sweetheart.
There.

115
00:06:30,564 --> 00:06:31,964
Here's your sippy.

116
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:34,184
- Hey, Honey.
- Good Morney, Grace.

117
00:06:34,571 --> 00:06:37,730
You know, yesterday in church,
all that stuff you were saying...

118
00:06:38,581 --> 00:06:40,679
Do you feel like
we're making you go to church or...

119
00:06:40,804 --> 00:06:43,205
It's not like you're making me
go to church, it's just...

120
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:46,804
You know, something
that we all do as a family.

121
00:06:46,929 --> 00:06:48,365
It's like a tradition, but...

122
00:06:49,378 --> 00:06:52,578
If you stop going, then I don't think
I'd probably keep going.

123
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:57,506
Coach Taylor at half-time,
"We"re done!"

124
00:06:57,868 --> 00:07:00,819
"We're beat up,
we can play anymore."

125
00:07:01,765 --> 00:07:03,215
I can't believe it.

126
00:07:04,028 --> 00:07:05,049
Hey, guys.

127
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,596
You're waiting on me.
You're backing up. Let's go.

128
00:07:10,926 --> 00:07:13,057
We missed you
at the game Friday night, Buddy.

129
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:15,267
Yeah,
I had to listen to it on the radio.

130
00:07:15,755 --> 00:07:17,589
I was really sick, it was terrible.

131
00:07:17,714 --> 00:07:20,355
Anything you feel like
sharing with us, Buddy?

132
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,339
Anything about a certain mailbox

133
00:07:24,464 --> 00:07:26,779
or an old friend of yours
named Eric Taylor?

134
00:07:29,644 --> 00:07:30,994
I don't think so.

135
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:33,801
I don't know what you're implying.

136
00:07:34,198 --> 00:07:37,498
I think this Luke deal has made
everybody go a little crazy.

137
00:07:37,733 --> 00:07:39,010
You know, Joe,

138
00:07:39,415 --> 00:07:42,125
I was a Panther
before everybody here.

139
00:07:42,647 --> 00:07:43,647
So,

140
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,798
I'll pretend you didn't say that.

141
00:07:47,195 --> 00:07:48,945
Go ahead with the agenda.

142
00:07:51,735 --> 00:07:52,977
Alright then.

143
00:07:53,792 --> 00:07:55,099
Gentlemen,

144
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:57,667
there is a 13-year old quarterback
in a Pop Warner League

145
00:07:57,792 --> 00:07:59,955
down in Little Tree
that needs a closer look at.

146
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,480
Who's gonna go down there?

147
00:08:02,443 --> 00:08:04,566
Lions in the house.
Let me hear you say, "Oh yeah!"

148
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,694
- What is that dude so happy about?
- I don't know what he is happy about.

149
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,405
I guess he thinks he gonna come out here
and kick our asses.

150
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:13,575
- Something, man.
- He's all, I'm a Panther.

151
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:15,702
Let's go!

152
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:18,583
Execute!

153
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,397
You're a long way from home, boy.

154
00:08:26,314 --> 00:08:27,131
I guess so.

155
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:32,136
Come on, get after him.
Pick him up.

156
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:33,846
Come on, Vince.

157
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,933
What are you doing?
You're dancing out here. Dancing.

158
00:08:38,388 --> 00:08:41,395
Don't start my day off like this.
Why is it I'm always talking to you?

159
00:08:41,806 --> 00:08:45,456
I spend half my day and my practice,
out here, talking to you.

160
00:08:45,864 --> 00:08:47,714
Get in the front. Do it again.

161
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,428
Get in the front.
Let me see it.

162
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:52,030
Luke, come here.

163
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,409
- I want you at the defensive backs.
- I don't play D, coach.

164
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:57,953
If I tell you to get down
to the defensive backs, you do.

165
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:00,209
Get on the defensive backs.

166
00:09:00,334 --> 00:09:02,040
Tim, you wanna take him down?

167
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,701
If you'd like to hurry that up,
that'd be just fine.

168
00:09:04,826 --> 00:09:06,376
It's a pleasure, man.

169
00:09:06,635 --> 00:09:09,381
Do it again. Let me see it again.
Get after him!

170
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,200
Move him! Come on,
let me see some of the speed!

171
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,421
How you doing?

172
00:09:14,546 --> 00:09:16,991
I mean, I'm alright,
that's just I don't play DB.

173
00:09:17,116 --> 00:09:18,266
It's alright.

174
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:20,418
What are you doing here?
Coaching now?

175
00:09:20,543 --> 00:09:22,943
- I'm helping out when I can.
- Nice.

176
00:09:24,322 --> 00:09:25,822
I saw you win State.

177
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:29,776
There you go.
DB it up.

178
00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:33,491
"His last installment
at the Austin Museum of Modern Art

179
00:09:33,616 --> 00:09:35,663
"is nothing short of mind bending.

180
00:09:35,788 --> 00:09:38,834
"A violent fusion of metal and artistry
that invokes somehow

181
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,164
"both anger and beauty through a complex
interplay of architecture and light.

182
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,815
"Brilliant, visceral,
and ultimately, ethereal,

183
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,635
"this work is not to be missed."

184
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,756
- You got the right Richard Sherman?
- Yep, it's him.

185
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,216
"Brilliant and ethereal"?

186
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:55,344
- It's what it says.
- The dude is an angry, abusive idiot.

187
00:09:55,742 --> 00:09:58,013
I don't understand
how he can get described as ethereal.

188
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,848
I don't know.

189
00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:02,059
Maybe it's his evil twin.

190
00:10:02,847 --> 00:10:04,102
Yeah, maybe.

191
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,770
Clearwater and back.

192
00:10:06,537 --> 00:10:08,987
This is going to be 400 miles
of hell.

193
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:12,697
Hey, coach.

194
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,406
Hey, Doug, how you doing?

195
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:15,948
I'm good.

196
00:10:18,834 --> 00:10:19,934
Nicely done.

197
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:22,871
- How is everything?
- Good, good.

198
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,448
The uniforms look great,
they're coming along, look beautiful.

199
00:10:25,573 --> 00:10:26,959
You're gonna be real happy.

200
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:30,206
Look, I know... I know I'm late
on payment and all this but...

201
00:10:30,331 --> 00:10:33,066
I know things are
rough here right now.

202
00:10:33,191 --> 00:10:35,008
It's just
if we're gonna deliver on Friday...

203
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:38,178
Well, I understand. We've had a few
little hiccups with our fundraising.

204
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:39,954
- Sure.
- And...

205
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:45,178
Look, Coach, you've been a friend
of Under Armor for a long while and...

206
00:10:45,434 --> 00:10:48,664
that's why we're doing this at our cost
and I'm gonna throw in some...

207
00:10:49,014 --> 00:10:51,692
hats and polos for your staff,
'cause you helped me out

208
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,269
when I was starting off.
So I won't forget that.

209
00:10:54,394 --> 00:10:56,844
I appreciate that,
I appreciate the...

210
00:10:57,898 --> 00:10:59,819
But I'm gonna need
a little something

211
00:10:59,944 --> 00:11:01,994
- to take back to Baltimore.
- Sure, I understand.

212
00:11:02,377 --> 00:11:05,581
How much?
How much is it that you need today?

213
00:11:06,311 --> 00:11:07,311
Five.

214
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:09,783
Five thousand?

215
00:11:13,921 --> 00:11:14,921
Alright...

216
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,226
You give me

217
00:11:18,132 --> 00:11:20,752
three now and two more on delivery

218
00:11:21,405 --> 00:11:23,231
and we'll let it go with that.

219
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,803
Alright. That's good, thank you.

220
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,792
Listen, I appreciate that very much.
I appreciate your understanding.

221
00:11:41,071 --> 00:11:43,402
- Is this a personal check, Coach?
- Yes, it is.

222
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,340
This gonna be okay with you?

223
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,247
If it's okay with you,
it is with me.

224
00:11:48,547 --> 00:11:51,526
- Alright. I'll get it going.
- Thank you very much.

225
00:11:52,334 --> 00:11:53,337
Alrighty.

226
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,185
Julie the other day
was talking about

227
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,184
how she doesn't want to go
to church anymore.

228
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,936
Like she's questioning her faith
or something.

229
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,688
You know what?
She's a teenager.

230
00:12:12,377 --> 00:12:15,077
You give her a week
and she'll turn around.

231
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:17,165
Be a hundred and eighty degrees.

232
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:19,428
But who knows
where she'll go from there.

233
00:12:19,553 --> 00:12:22,578
I don't think she's going to hell
anytime soon so don't worry about it.

234
00:12:22,703 --> 00:12:24,951
I gotta go meet with Buddy.
I'm gonna try to figure out

235
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,982
how in the hell
you're supposed to...

236
00:12:27,107 --> 00:12:29,831
- beg money from the Boosters.
- I hate that.

237
00:12:30,363 --> 00:12:31,833
Alright. Hey, listen.

238
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:33,752
Did you write a check...

239
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,714
and not put it in the book?
Because there's a check missing.

240
00:12:38,129 --> 00:12:39,925
Yeah, it's for Reds.

241
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:43,116
It's for the Dry Cleaners.
It's for $45.

242
00:12:44,226 --> 00:12:47,244
- Sorry.
- You've got to put that in the book.

243
00:12:47,369 --> 00:12:48,600
I can't keep track.

244
00:12:57,214 --> 00:12:58,688
- I'm here.
- Come on, let's go.

245
00:12:58,813 --> 00:13:01,405
- We got 200 miles to cover.
- We're taking my car?

246
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:05,166
- I hope you're paying for gas.
- I'm teaching you the meaning of life

247
00:13:05,467 --> 00:13:08,713
- and I'm supposed to cover for gas too?
- Meaning of life...

248
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,270
Maybe I should get you a lunch
and how about a damn souvenir?

249
00:13:12,395 --> 00:13:15,201
I'm just saying
this is a non-paying internship, okay?

250
00:13:15,326 --> 00:13:18,789
- Smells like old pizza in here, man.
- Well, that's how I pay for gas.

251
00:13:19,928 --> 00:13:22,440
I'm glad you're masking it
with cigarette smoke.

252
00:13:22,733 --> 00:13:24,094
- That's cool.
- Let's roll.

253
00:13:27,145 --> 00:13:28,831
- Yes, sir?
- Come here.

254
00:13:29,632 --> 00:13:30,642
Yeah, coach?

255
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:34,688
I want you on special teams today
working on punting.

256
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:37,899
- Yeah. I'd love to catch some punts.
- Good.

257
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,986
I don't want you catching.
I want you to work on the punting.

258
00:13:41,803 --> 00:13:44,103
You want me, like, kicking the ball?

259
00:13:44,228 --> 00:13:45,654
I don't know if I've ever...

260
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:47,733
That's what you do
when you punt the ball.

261
00:13:47,858 --> 00:13:50,871
- I understand. I know what it is.
- Special teams punting.

262
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:54,776
- Can you do that for me?
- Yes. I'm only considering myself...

263
00:13:55,372 --> 00:13:56,376
a hands man.

264
00:13:56,829 --> 00:13:59,004
I need a punter.
So if you would consider

265
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,631
hang times and couffin corners,
I'd appreciate that.

266
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,916
- Thank you very much.
- I'll go start practicing right now.

267
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:06,391
Thank you, coach.

268
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:13,143
- Coach, can I have a word please?
- Sure. Come on in.

269
00:14:14,158 --> 00:14:17,481
I think we got off on the wrong foot
and I wanted to clear everything out.

270
00:14:18,112 --> 00:14:19,401
I just wanna say...

271
00:14:19,665 --> 00:14:23,665
I don't hold anything against you
for the thing between me and your wife.

272
00:14:23,865 --> 00:14:24,865
And...

273
00:14:25,171 --> 00:14:27,365
I'm not here to give you a hard time
but to play football.

274
00:14:29,178 --> 00:14:30,535
Good, I'm glad.

275
00:14:31,212 --> 00:14:32,954
'Coz I don't think you should be.

276
00:14:33,355 --> 00:14:36,846
As far as my wife's concerned, she was
not the one who caused these problems.

277
00:14:36,971 --> 00:14:39,534
You caused these problems
for yourself, isn't it?

278
00:14:39,909 --> 00:14:43,256
You were doing something knowingly wrong
and you got caught, yeah?

279
00:14:43,974 --> 00:14:47,978
That lands yourself responsible
so take that responsibility.

280
00:14:49,142 --> 00:14:52,432
As far as the rest, we'll see
what you got when you're out there.

281
00:14:56,115 --> 00:14:57,315
Thanks, coach.

282
00:15:02,813 --> 00:15:05,509
You see stuff like this, okay?
Get that, too.

283
00:15:05,634 --> 00:15:06,634
All right.

284
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:12,895
When you're looking at all this rusty,
metal stuff, it's all dirty...

285
00:15:13,098 --> 00:15:14,948
do you see something in it?

286
00:15:16,232 --> 00:15:17,916
Do I see something in it?

287
00:15:18,573 --> 00:15:21,545
I mean, like something,
for your art.

288
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,933
I see the face of God.

289
00:15:36,043 --> 00:15:38,693
- Right.
- I don't know, man! I don't know.

290
00:15:38,902 --> 00:15:40,480
You ask too many damn questions.

291
00:15:41,028 --> 00:15:42,028
Questions.

292
00:15:42,286 --> 00:15:44,818
- It was one question.
- Gonna take a little break.

293
00:15:45,238 --> 00:15:46,438
Not you, but...

294
00:15:47,602 --> 00:15:49,072
let's get the rest in there.

295
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,240
Yeah.

296
00:15:58,284 --> 00:16:00,500
I had to borrow your bathroom,
'coz mine's not working.

297
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,919
I talked to your mom about it.
She said it's cool, so...

298
00:16:03,453 --> 00:16:05,885
Okay, I don't care.
Hey, which one do you like better?

299
00:16:06,554 --> 00:16:07,654
The red one?

300
00:16:09,217 --> 00:16:10,218
Or the pink one?

301
00:16:10,634 --> 00:16:12,971
- For what?
- I have a pageant coming up

302
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:16,398
and these are kinda old
but I don't think they're too short.

303
00:16:16,523 --> 00:16:17,559
What do you think?

304
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:21,199
I don't think I'm qualified. I think
it's best to ask your mom for this.

305
00:16:21,324 --> 00:16:24,608
She's not here, and it's just a dress.
Which one do you prefer?

306
00:16:24,822 --> 00:16:26,902
- Where's your mom?
- She's working.

307
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:29,529
Every night?
She can't help out with this ever?

308
00:16:30,148 --> 00:16:31,742
Yeah. It's not a big deal.

309
00:16:32,482 --> 00:16:34,909
- I can try it on if that's easier?
- What?

310
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,455
- I can try them on for you.
- I don't know.

311
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,659
- I don't think I...
- Wait, which one?

312
00:16:39,784 --> 00:16:41,416
You're good. Pink for sure!

313
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,085
Get the pink.
You'll win with that.

314
00:16:44,848 --> 00:16:45,962
Good luck.

315
00:16:53,581 --> 00:16:56,585
Alright, so how about I just throw
my last two pucks and we take off?

316
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:57,515
Why?

317
00:16:57,913 --> 00:17:00,101
I got stuff to do.
I got people to take care of.

318
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,686
We're doing anything here.

319
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:05,190
- We're just playing shuffleboard.
- Alright, let's talk then.

320
00:17:05,885 --> 00:17:07,776
- You want to talk now?
- I can talk.

321
00:17:08,567 --> 00:17:10,195
I'm not a dick all the time.

322
00:17:10,586 --> 00:17:13,239
- So talk. Talk.
- Okay.

323
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:16,215
Fine.
What would you say is the most

324
00:17:16,804 --> 00:17:19,329
important tool
for an artist to have?

325
00:17:19,927 --> 00:17:23,249
- What's with you and these questions?
- You just told me to talk.

326
00:17:23,746 --> 00:17:26,169
I meant, you know,
talk about yourself while

327
00:17:26,771 --> 00:17:29,089
I'm secretly mocking you in my head.

328
00:17:29,602 --> 00:17:33,510
You know what? How about I settle up
our tab and then we'll take off.

329
00:17:35,356 --> 00:17:36,356
Watch out.

330
00:17:36,869 --> 00:17:39,705
The most important tool
an artist can have

331
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,317
is selfishness.

332
00:17:42,703 --> 00:17:43,978
- Selfishness?
- Yeah.

333
00:17:44,242 --> 00:17:46,227
It means
you're gonna spend your life

334
00:17:46,661 --> 00:17:48,561
trying to express some quiet

335
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,153
dark corner, deep, deep inside you.

336
00:17:52,687 --> 00:17:54,739
You will put aside love,

337
00:17:55,433 --> 00:17:56,282
God,

338
00:17:57,008 --> 00:17:58,008
life...

339
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:00,890
in order to follow this craving.

340
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:03,540
So my advice to you is

341
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,626
to just screw everybody else
and maybe you got a chance.

342
00:18:10,658 --> 00:18:11,965
I wrote a personal check.

343
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:14,267
I've got to get that money together
and quick.

344
00:18:14,392 --> 00:18:16,949
I don't know how to talk to boosters.
You do.

345
00:18:17,074 --> 00:18:19,931
I don't know how to ask for money.
You're great at asking for money.

346
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,148
All I'm doing is asking your help.

347
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,369
I know and I'd like to Eric

348
00:18:24,494 --> 00:18:28,231
but I got Joe McCoy and thoses guys
breathing down my neck.

349
00:18:28,796 --> 00:18:31,526
They think I'm the one
who told you about the mailbox.

350
00:18:32,547 --> 00:18:35,321
- You are the one who told me.
- I know,

351
00:18:35,689 --> 00:18:38,139
but I've got to unknow that
right now.

352
00:18:38,597 --> 00:18:40,410
They may be having me followed.

353
00:18:41,128 --> 00:18:44,414
They probably got my phone tapped
or maybe bugged. You know the guys,

354
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:47,709
- they're crazy, man!
- A little crazy, but let me tell you.

355
00:18:48,117 --> 00:18:50,067
Levi, now, Principal Burnwell

356
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:53,931
has informed me he's willing
to shut down the football at the school,

357
00:18:54,142 --> 00:18:55,269
if need be.

358
00:18:55,896 --> 00:18:58,617
That's what I'm up against.
I'm asking you for your help.

359
00:18:58,742 --> 00:18:59,804
That's terrible.

360
00:19:00,204 --> 00:19:01,994
And I'm sorry to say this

361
00:19:02,258 --> 00:19:04,890
but I cannot help you right now.

362
00:19:05,284 --> 00:19:06,434
I just can't.

363
00:19:07,923 --> 00:19:09,397
- You know what?
- What?

364
00:19:10,464 --> 00:19:14,095
You need to polish that ring of yours.
It's looking a bit tarnished.

365
00:19:24,921 --> 00:19:27,082
An earthquake in West Texas?

366
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:28,933
Yeah.

367
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,766
They have 'em. Odessa?

368
00:19:31,052 --> 00:19:34,366
Odessa's on the permian basin
and that's a fault line, honey.

369
00:19:34,491 --> 00:19:36,674
They have 'em.
What would you do? Would you pray?

370
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:40,720
I'd probably check on you
and Gracie and Dad

371
00:19:41,644 --> 00:19:43,598
and then I'd stand under a doorway.

372
00:19:44,236 --> 00:19:47,977
Alright, I hear you. That's great.
It's all good but would you pray?

373
00:19:48,352 --> 00:19:49,354
How about...

374
00:19:49,604 --> 00:19:50,626
next time...

375
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,483
there's an earthquake in West Texas
I'll let you know?

376
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,737
Come on, now!

377
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:08,122
Way to bring the wood, Cafferty!
Bring that wood!

378
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,172
All right!

379
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:31,062
Come on!
Hey, Vince, what are you doing, man?

380
00:20:31,415 --> 00:20:34,733
You've got to make that play.
You've gotta catch that ball.

381
00:20:35,088 --> 00:20:36,484
How can you miss that?

382
00:20:37,254 --> 00:20:40,655
You're not gonna make that play today,
how are you gonna make it Friday?

383
00:20:40,946 --> 00:20:41,948
Look at me.

384
00:20:42,362 --> 00:20:45,251
You can't make that play,
what are you out here for?

385
00:20:46,009 --> 00:20:47,829
Hey guys, let's bring it in!

386
00:20:52,402 --> 00:20:53,251
Good job.

387
00:20:53,596 --> 00:20:55,920
What am I, the Invisible Man out here?
Did you see that?

388
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,965
It's like he's not even seeing me
work my butt off out there.

389
00:20:59,367 --> 00:21:01,718
- What do you mean?
- Coach didn't even look at me.

390
00:21:02,051 --> 00:21:05,388
He's got a lot on his plate, that's why.
Keep doing what you're doing though.

391
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:07,056
Thank you for noticing.

392
00:21:10,172 --> 00:21:11,572
I'll see ya later.

393
00:21:13,758 --> 00:21:14,808
Who's that?

394
00:21:16,934 --> 00:21:18,818
I'm renting a room from her mom,
that's it.

395
00:21:19,035 --> 00:21:21,520
- You're what?
- I'm renting a room from her mom.

396
00:21:21,645 --> 00:21:23,943
Wish I was renting a room
from her mom.

397
00:21:26,065 --> 00:21:27,165
Just joking.

398
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:33,758
Look man. You make sure he know
the difference between coach and dad.

399
00:21:33,883 --> 00:21:37,128
He's always yelling at me, you know,
on the field. Telling me what to do.

400
00:21:37,253 --> 00:21:39,255
Pushing me. Grabbing my jersey.

401
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:42,675
He embarrass me in front of everyone.
That's not how I get down, dude.

402
00:21:43,014 --> 00:21:45,064
That white boy sucks.
Why's he all up in my face?

403
00:21:45,189 --> 00:21:48,556
Coming up where I hang out,
at my house, talking to my moms.

404
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:51,976
And you already know my mom's situation.
You know how I feel about that.

405
00:21:52,413 --> 00:21:54,020
It's alright though, it's cool

406
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:56,920
'coz he's bringing that white boy Luke.
He think he gonna take over.

407
00:21:57,045 --> 00:21:58,942
He's supposed to be
a Panther's star.

408
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:03,112
That's my spot. That's my team.
I'm the Running Back.

409
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,073
Look man! At the end of the day,

410
00:22:05,307 --> 00:22:08,368
white man gonna stick with the white.
They're gonna look out for each other.

411
00:22:08,601 --> 00:22:10,211
That's what we gotta do.

412
00:22:10,336 --> 00:22:12,247
We gotta look out for us, alright?

413
00:22:14,942 --> 00:22:15,942
25 more.

414
00:22:17,332 --> 00:22:19,921
Hey, Riggins, why don't you wear
your Panthers state ring?

415
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:23,383
I don't know. That's a good question.
I guess I don't like rings.

416
00:22:24,216 --> 00:22:26,594
What was it like, going to State
and winning that ring?

417
00:22:27,504 --> 00:22:28,971
It's pretty good, man.

418
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,140
You gotta give this team a chance.

419
00:22:32,813 --> 00:22:36,187
Dude, be serious.
This team is not the Dillon Panthers.

420
00:22:36,995 --> 00:22:38,371
The Coach doesn't like me.

421
00:22:38,496 --> 00:22:40,487
He's been pretty clear on the field.

422
00:22:40,612 --> 00:22:44,040
In practice, sticking me on D,
no disrespect, that's not what I do.

423
00:22:44,165 --> 00:22:47,073
He's mad about his wife
getting all backlash

424
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:49,993
for throwing me off the Panthers.
I want to play football, man.

425
00:22:50,677 --> 00:22:51,869
I want a State ring.

426
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,129
Like I said,

427
00:22:53,254 --> 00:22:55,873
give it a chance, trust the coach.

428
00:22:59,774 --> 00:23:00,920
- What?
- How're you?

429
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,741
- Good, what's up?
- Where you going?

430
00:23:02,866 --> 00:23:06,342
Drum up some business from local leaders
in the form of cash. What do you need?

431
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,264
As you know I've been working
with Luke, a lot. And he's good.

432
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:14,954
Damn good. And I think he's worth
getting a tougher look at.

433
00:23:15,689 --> 00:23:18,938
- What's that supposed to mean?
- He thinks you hate him

434
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:20,445
is what I'm trying to say.

435
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:23,151
I don't have the time or resources
for sensitivity training.

436
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:27,030
He's got to get rid of the concept
that we're gonna kiss his ass 24/7

437
00:23:27,511 --> 00:23:30,867
'coz he's gracing us with his presence.
Tell him to shut up and work him hard.

438
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:34,185
- I'll deal with the rest later. Thanks.
- Yes, sir.

439
00:23:41,043 --> 00:23:42,143
Can we play?

440
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,393
I mean, I was supposed to be...

441
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:48,346
working on my punting
but if you all want to play afterwards

442
00:23:48,544 --> 00:23:51,429
- or if you want to watch...
- Yeah! Let's do it!

443
00:23:55,887 --> 00:23:56,893
You suck!

444
00:23:57,224 --> 00:23:58,227
That's nice.

445
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:02,523
- I'm sorry.
- The ball's supposed to go straight.

446
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,525
See that was actually all planned...

447
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,173
Want some pointers?

448
00:24:07,209 --> 00:24:08,863
Do you know a lot about punting?

449
00:24:09,551 --> 00:24:11,051
Yeah, actually I do.

450
00:24:11,176 --> 00:24:12,483
Here look, you wanna...

451
00:24:12,608 --> 00:24:15,036
Okay, I can show you 3 steps, alright?
You wanna make sure

452
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:18,247
that you keep that lean forward position
so keep your head down.

453
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:21,167
Make sure
that you hit the middle of the ball

454
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:24,379
with this part of your foot, okay?
So point your toes, okay?

455
00:24:24,706 --> 00:24:27,507
And make sure you follow through
all the way with your leg.

456
00:24:27,853 --> 00:24:30,968
But don't be stiff.
Like, loosen up, okay?

457
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,929
- But don't think!
- Okay.

458
00:24:37,139 --> 00:24:39,310
- Well, that was better.
- That was good.

459
00:24:39,549 --> 00:24:42,230
I'm good, right?
Yeah, I'm good.

460
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:44,315
I don't think
that's ever gonna happen again.

461
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:45,485
Yeah, it will...

462
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:48,611
Especially not whenever all the
thousands of screaming fans are around.

463
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:52,198
- What fans?
- I mean, one away game or something...

464
00:24:54,344 --> 00:24:57,787
- Can you all go get the balls?
- Let's go!

465
00:24:59,615 --> 00:25:00,830
My little men...

466
00:25:00,955 --> 00:25:02,542
You just gotta keep doing it, okay?

467
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,902
Over and over.

468
00:25:04,027 --> 00:25:06,796
Do it thousands of times
'coz you'll get that muscle memory.

469
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:08,869
Just forget about the...

470
00:25:08,994 --> 00:25:11,926
you know, the guys,
the big guys charging at you,

471
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:14,432
the fans, the chaos...
Just like zone in,

472
00:25:14,557 --> 00:25:16,264
zone in inside yourself

473
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:20,101
and forget it all.
Let all chaos just go...

474
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:23,987
Just let it go...

475
00:25:24,173 --> 00:25:25,356
Let it go, you know?

476
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:29,193
Where'd you learn so much
about football?

477
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,863
My... my father.

478
00:25:32,168 --> 00:25:34,615
He used to play football,
he was a quarterback.

479
00:25:35,078 --> 00:25:36,756
He almost went pro, too,

480
00:25:36,881 --> 00:25:39,787
but now he can't stand it.
Thinks it's a big waste of time.

481
00:25:40,034 --> 00:25:41,872
Where'd you learn so much
about the...

482
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:44,542
Did you study Buddhism?

483
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:47,587
No, no, no, I just...
It's my life,

484
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:48,755
you know?

485
00:25:54,851 --> 00:25:58,855
How'd it go trying to get the Boosters
together and all that what not?

486
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:05,056
I went to about
twelve of the local businesses

487
00:26:05,635 --> 00:26:06,731
and found out

488
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:09,164
that they either don't know
there's a football team,

489
00:26:09,289 --> 00:26:11,819
or they could give a damn less.

490
00:26:12,497 --> 00:26:13,821
Sorry about that.

491
00:26:14,134 --> 00:26:16,449
Yeah...
And I stopped over at the bar

492
00:26:17,353 --> 00:26:20,411
and I had a drink and I left the car
over there and Alan gave me a ride home.

493
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,977
So if you could take me
to get it, I'd appreciate it.

494
00:26:23,102 --> 00:26:23,915
Okay.

495
00:26:25,387 --> 00:26:28,836
You know yesterday, you asked me
about the check for the Dry Cleaners?

496
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:32,381
It wasn't for the Dry Cleaners.
It wasn't for $45 dollars.

497
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,800
It was for Under Armor.
It was for gear for the team

498
00:26:35,059 --> 00:26:36,709
and it was for $3,000.

499
00:26:36,834 --> 00:26:38,346
You wrote a check for $3,000?

500
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:41,098
- We don't have $3,000 in our account!
- I know that.

501
00:26:41,947 --> 00:26:43,634
But when I wrote the check...

502
00:26:44,092 --> 00:26:47,480
It's not gonna be run through right away
so you don't have to worry about it.

503
00:26:47,816 --> 00:26:49,860
I would have appreciated
if you had talked to me.

504
00:26:49,985 --> 00:26:51,359
I didn't have time to.

505
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:53,664
- You didn't have time to talk about it?
- No, I didn't.

506
00:26:53,789 --> 00:26:55,363
I'm telling you about it now.

507
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:58,616
Listen, I know you're having
a hard time, but come on now.

508
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:00,859
Why would you not
talk to me about that?

509
00:27:00,984 --> 00:27:03,461
They said if I don't write the check,
I don't have uniforms.

510
00:27:03,586 --> 00:27:06,415
Without team, I don't make money anyway,
so what the hell does it matter?

511
00:27:06,783 --> 00:27:09,085
If I can get the money from Burnwell
who I've been talking to,

512
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:11,285
which I think I can do,
everything will be fine.

513
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:13,339
It's just a matter of doing it.
I just need time.

514
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:16,300
- I'm just telling you for the sake...
- Don't raise your voice.

515
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,969
I'm not raising my voice.

516
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:20,846
Why don't you just stay calm
and stop getting all riled up?

517
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:24,016
You'll get your damn uniforms, but in
the meantime, what about our accounts?

518
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,894
You write yourself
a check for $3,000

519
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:30,606
without talking to me about it, you lie
to me about it, we don't have that money

520
00:27:31,465 --> 00:27:33,526
and then you come in here
and yell at me?

521
00:27:34,504 --> 00:27:35,854
I don't think so.

522
00:28:30,386 --> 00:28:33,085
Hey, Luke!
Your football coach is here.

523
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:36,005
He's got work to do before school.

524
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:38,779
- I won't take much time at all.
- I appreciate it.

525
00:28:39,404 --> 00:28:40,747
Morning, Coach.

526
00:28:40,872 --> 00:28:42,470
- I'm alright. And you?
- Good.

527
00:28:43,308 --> 00:28:44,847
- Why are you here?
- I understand

528
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:46,849
you're not happy at practice.
Wanna talk?

529
00:28:48,442 --> 00:28:51,004
No disrespect, Coach,
I just feel like I'm not being used.

530
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:52,897
You're not giving me
a chance out there.

531
00:28:53,355 --> 00:28:54,607
What do you want from me?

532
00:28:55,152 --> 00:28:58,195
First of all, I haven't gotten a chance
to play offense, which is what I do.

533
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,113
You'll get your chance.
You'll get it when I give it to you.

534
00:29:01,441 --> 00:29:02,923
I'm trying to put a team together.

535
00:29:03,048 --> 00:29:05,318
I got 18 other players
I'm trying to pay attention to.

536
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:08,120
I can't put you up on a pedestal
and pay all the attention to you.

537
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:11,582
I want to get out of here, alright?
That's why I'm playing football.

538
00:29:11,884 --> 00:29:14,293
I mean, this is it for me.
This is all I care about.

539
00:29:14,549 --> 00:29:17,713
All I ever cared about. My parents don't
help me out with this, they don't care.

540
00:29:18,406 --> 00:29:21,709
I was on my fast track, got to Dillon
Panthers and I'm not there anymore.

541
00:29:21,834 --> 00:29:24,720
But here I am, willing to kill myself
'coz I want to get out of here.

542
00:29:25,463 --> 00:29:27,431
I just want a chance to play ball.

543
00:29:28,088 --> 00:29:29,558
I want a chance to get noticed.

544
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:31,052
I understand...

545
00:29:31,177 --> 00:29:34,397
that you're helluva player. You can run
circles around all the people out there.

546
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:36,524
I understand everything
you've been through.

547
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:39,523
I understand what it's like
to wanna be a Panther.

548
00:29:39,738 --> 00:29:41,654
Believe me, that's not lost on me.

549
00:29:43,636 --> 00:29:44,949
Anything else that you need?

550
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:48,577
What I need? I need a scholarship to
a good school so I can get out of here.

551
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:50,533
Listen, I'll tell you what.

552
00:29:51,413 --> 00:29:53,457
I will do everything in my power

553
00:29:53,929 --> 00:29:55,394
to get you just that,

554
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:58,462
if you do one thing for me.

555
00:29:58,781 --> 00:29:59,588
What?

556
00:29:59,889 --> 00:30:01,317
I need you to lead.

557
00:30:02,601 --> 00:30:03,601
Alright.

558
00:30:04,382 --> 00:30:06,130
Do you understand what I'm saying?

559
00:30:06,255 --> 00:30:07,793
- Yeah.
- Lead...

560
00:30:08,777 --> 00:30:10,227
Alright, thank you.

561
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:14,691
- Want a slap on the back? You earn it.
- Alright.

562
00:30:15,678 --> 00:30:18,682
- See you out there this afternoon.
- Alright, see you out there.

563
00:30:23,374 --> 00:30:24,447
Thanks for the ride.

564
00:30:24,691 --> 00:30:26,279
Yeah. You got a boyfriend?

565
00:30:26,706 --> 00:30:27,707
No, why?

566
00:30:27,832 --> 00:30:31,469
That's the guy that should be doing
all this, giving you rides everywhere.

567
00:30:31,793 --> 00:30:34,832
Since you're already doing it,
you'd be more efficient if you were.

568
00:30:37,853 --> 00:30:38,946
I'm just kidding.

569
00:30:40,218 --> 00:30:42,923
Have you ever run
into that new Cafferty kid?

570
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:44,592
- Luke?
- Yeah, Luke.

571
00:30:44,835 --> 00:30:45,985
He likes you.

572
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:49,180
I've been working with him
on the field and everything and...

573
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:51,474
he doesn't stop
talking about you, so...

574
00:30:51,642 --> 00:30:52,452
And?

575
00:30:52,577 --> 00:30:56,498
I'm just giving you a heads up,
just in case you want a boyfriend.

576
00:30:57,099 --> 00:30:58,712
He's a pretty good guy.

577
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:02,518
I'll talk to him.

578
00:31:04,609 --> 00:31:05,609
Good.

579
00:31:18,305 --> 00:31:21,128
I just thought I'd swing by
on my way home from work.

580
00:31:23,377 --> 00:31:24,381
I'm sorry.

581
00:31:24,969 --> 00:31:26,369
I appreciate that.

582
00:31:27,908 --> 00:31:29,822
Doug called from Under Armor.

583
00:31:29,947 --> 00:31:32,309
He said he's willing to wait
for the school to pay for the 2,000

584
00:31:32,434 --> 00:31:35,234
and the other 3,000,
he's gonna take it easy on me.

585
00:31:35,906 --> 00:31:37,353
And I will get it paid.

586
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:38,897
OK.

587
00:31:40,626 --> 00:31:42,726
Honey, don't ever do that again.

588
00:31:43,171 --> 00:31:44,171
I won't.

589
00:31:45,325 --> 00:31:47,863
And I'm sorry
you're having such a hard time.

590
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:58,332
Sounds like Coach is gonna be
moving up Sobel

591
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,960
- to take Luke's spot, tonight.
- Yeah, meanwhile, Luke Cafferty

592
00:32:01,128 --> 00:32:03,629
is on his way of being massacred
in his first Lions game.

593
00:32:04,443 --> 00:32:05,593
What a waste.

594
00:32:06,071 --> 00:32:08,092
One good thing is gonna
come out of this, tough.

595
00:32:08,602 --> 00:32:10,636
McCoy is gunning
for Principal Taylor.

596
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:12,846
What are you talking about, Lester?

597
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:15,068
McCoy'll figure a way
to get that bitch out of there.

598
00:32:15,193 --> 00:32:18,243
- There you go.
- I can't even believe you, Moore.

599
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,865
I got something to say to everybody.

600
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,631
I hate to...

601
00:32:25,042 --> 00:32:26,402
spoil the party, but...

602
00:32:26,818 --> 00:32:29,071
This is to everybody.
You know what?

603
00:32:29,456 --> 00:32:31,115
I'm not a Panther anymore.

604
00:32:31,465 --> 00:32:34,278
You used to be my friends,
I don't know who you are.

605
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:37,121
I don't know what you believe in,
but it's not the Panthers.

606
00:32:37,906 --> 00:32:41,125
It's not the Panthers I believed in,
it's not the Panthers we grew up with.

607
00:32:41,487 --> 00:32:43,794
I'll tell you that right now,
you wanna know another thing?

608
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,630
I'm the one who told Eric
about the mailbox.

609
00:32:49,181 --> 00:32:52,928
I can't live with myself anymore,
I put that mailbox in, 12 years ago.

610
00:32:53,282 --> 00:32:55,472
In the middle of the night,
I dug that hole and put it in.

611
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,183
It's my mailbox, I can do
whatever I want to with it.

612
00:32:59,099 --> 00:33:00,099
And Joe...

613
00:33:00,384 --> 00:33:01,186
I tried,

614
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,981
but ever since you got here,
you've been a cancer to me,

615
00:33:04,479 --> 00:33:08,068
you've been a cancer to my friends
and you've been a cancer to this team.

616
00:33:08,981 --> 00:33:11,250
And just one more thing I wanna say.

617
00:33:11,707 --> 00:33:13,157
It's clear eyes,

618
00:33:13,571 --> 00:33:14,575
full hearts,

619
00:33:15,525 --> 00:33:16,575
can't lose.

620
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:32,244
- I just gotta drop this off real quick.
- Yeah, no problem, take your time.

621
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,286
Who the hell are you, little girl?

622
00:34:00,256 --> 00:34:01,978
Hi, I'm Julie.

623
00:34:03,426 --> 00:34:05,070
Matt's girlfriend.
He went inside

624
00:34:05,195 --> 00:34:07,189
to drop off that tool
you asked him to pick up.

625
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:10,130
So you're the ball and chain
that keep dragging him down.

626
00:34:12,786 --> 00:34:15,686
I think I married you
about 20 years ago, babe.

627
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,426
Thought we'll get new uniforms. What are
we doing, playing in our practice stuff?

628
00:34:35,551 --> 00:34:39,118
Tinker, why don't you do less talking
and more thinking about the game, son?

629
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:42,860
Let's go.

630
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:52,013
Let's go, gentlemen.
Let's go!

631
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:03,308
Look at this!
Alright!

632
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:09,800
Oh, these are official right here.

633
00:35:25,984 --> 00:35:27,406
Hey, listen up!

634
00:35:28,171 --> 00:35:29,460
Listen up, gentlemen.

635
00:35:29,715 --> 00:35:30,715
Listen up!

636
00:35:31,711 --> 00:35:33,228
They may be new...

637
00:35:33,787 --> 00:35:35,174
but they're still work clothes.

638
00:35:37,744 --> 00:35:39,094
Let's go to work!

639
00:35:53,933 --> 00:35:55,764
All of a sudden,
he was talking to me.

640
00:35:55,889 --> 00:35:58,387
That's the first time
I have a real conversation with him.

641
00:35:58,512 --> 00:36:00,824
He's actually a really smart guy.

642
00:36:01,257 --> 00:36:05,208
He had real interesting things to say,
it was crazy.

643
00:36:06,642 --> 00:36:08,415
Do you think I'm holding you back?

644
00:36:11,157 --> 00:36:11,963
No.

645
00:36:12,315 --> 00:36:13,128
Why?

646
00:36:13,521 --> 00:36:15,214
I was outside waiting for you...

647
00:36:15,967 --> 00:36:18,717
and Richard Sherman came out
and started talking to me.

648
00:36:19,425 --> 00:36:20,427
About what?

649
00:36:21,604 --> 00:36:24,598
He said I was the ball and chain
holding you back.

650
00:36:27,464 --> 00:36:28,625
That's stupid.

651
00:36:29,596 --> 00:36:31,855
You're the most
important thing in my life.

652
00:36:33,068 --> 00:36:34,818
What if that's the point?

653
00:36:35,774 --> 00:36:37,373
No, that's not the point.

654
00:36:38,002 --> 00:36:41,031
The point is that he's stupid,
that he was drunk.

655
00:36:41,706 --> 00:36:43,356
He don't know about us.

656
00:36:44,286 --> 00:36:45,786
Eat your bean curd.

657
00:36:46,308 --> 00:36:47,880
- Alright.
- Alright.

658
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,167
<i>Lions down, 27-0 late in the fourth.</i>

659
00:36:52,855 --> 00:36:55,534
<i>They are definitely
gonna finish this one, folks.</i>

660
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:58,799
<i>Cafferty on the Bronco blitz.
He hits him in the backfield!</i>

661
00:36:59,088 --> 00:37:01,468
<i>Luke Cafferty has been
bringing it all night!</i>

662
00:37:01,714 --> 00:37:02,719
Nice hit, Luke!

663
00:37:02,972 --> 00:37:05,323
<i>If the Lions could just
get on the board, tonight,</i>

664
00:37:05,448 --> 00:37:08,433
<i>it'd make a whole heck of a lot
of difference to this football team.</i>

665
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:10,394
- That's it!
- <i>It drops back in the pocket.</i>

666
00:37:11,723 --> 00:37:14,401
<i>And Howard gets burned
on the wheel route.</i>

667
00:37:14,811 --> 00:37:16,151
<i>He's got a man open.</i>

668
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:17,998
<i>He's got the outside!</i>

669
00:37:18,123 --> 00:37:21,006
<i>Luke Cafferty makes
another touchdown saving hit.</i>

670
00:37:21,131 --> 00:37:23,819
<i>Vince Howard has just gotten smoked
all night long.</i>

671
00:37:23,944 --> 00:37:26,824
<i>A real disappointment
after such a promising start.</i>

672
00:37:26,949 --> 00:37:27,953
Stay in it!

673
00:37:28,551 --> 00:37:30,654
Huddle up, defense.
Huddle up, defense!

674
00:37:30,779 --> 00:37:32,958
Vince, don't jump on the front,
it's 3 & 10.

675
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:35,022
Who made you coach?
That's what I thought.

676
00:37:36,377 --> 00:37:37,573
4-3-code 2.

677
00:37:37,698 --> 00:37:39,799
- 4-3-code 2. Ready?
- Break.

678
00:37:40,773 --> 00:37:43,875
<i>Never say die, never quit.
30 seconds left in the game.</i>

679
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,096
<i>Let's see if Cafferty and Howard
can put some pressure</i>

680
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:48,891
<i>on this Rattler offense
and make something happen.</i>

681
00:37:50,694 --> 00:37:52,129
<i>And back to pass.</i>

682
00:37:53,063 --> 00:37:55,363
<i>Looking to cross the middle.
Fires!</i>

683
00:37:57,025 --> 00:38:00,319
<i>Luke Cafferty! Interception!
He's bringing it the other way!</i>

684
00:38:01,538 --> 00:38:02,946
- There you go!
- <i>Here we go!</i>

685
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,115
<i>He's got a line up the sideline,
look at it go!</i>

686
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,783
<i>Man, is this kid fast!</i>

687
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,952
<i>One man to beat,
he's got a blocker on front!</i>

688
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:10,204
<i>He could go!</i>

689
00:38:10,473 --> 00:38:12,372
- Stop him, Vince!
- <i>Oh, mercy!</i>

690
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,042
What was that?

691
00:38:15,424 --> 00:38:17,711
<i>Luke Cafferty is up
and I'll tell you what,</i>

692
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:21,251
<i>he's not happy about it,
Vince Howard is getting an earful.</i>

693
00:38:21,376 --> 00:38:24,509
- You are your own problem, Vince!
- Too fast, man. You're too fast.

694
00:38:24,805 --> 00:38:26,178
Vince, what was that?

695
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:28,252
- What was that?
- I didn't have an angle!

696
00:38:28,377 --> 00:38:31,113
What do you mean, didn't have an angle?
You could've run circles around him!

697
00:38:31,238 --> 00:38:34,102
- Don't waste no energy, Coach!
- Let me tell you something!

698
00:38:34,227 --> 00:38:36,731
You know why I always pick on you?
'Coz you're good, that's why.

699
00:38:36,899 --> 00:38:40,087
You know why you have a problem?
'Coz you're your own worst damn enemy!

700
00:38:40,212 --> 00:38:42,500
- Fine! Get out of my face!
- No! You get out of my face

701
00:38:42,625 --> 00:38:44,935
and let me tell you something:
put that damn helmet right now.

702
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:48,450
Don't you dare talk to me like that.
You change it right now.

703
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:50,994
Or you will be out of this game
so damn fast you will never...

704
00:38:51,875 --> 00:38:53,121
- Yes, sir!
- Understood?

705
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:55,457
- Landry!
- Yes, Coach.

706
00:38:55,973 --> 00:38:59,711
- Get out there. Get us a field goal.
- Field goal! Here we go! Here we go!

707
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:01,672
You're on the field goal team!

708
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,966
Get in there, then!

709
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:06,343
Don't you ever take that helmet off
in front of me. Do you understand me?

710
00:39:06,942 --> 00:39:09,888
<i>Taylor lining up for the field goal.
Trying to get on the board.</i>

711
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,598
<i>Clock is ticking, folks.</i>

712
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,141
Snap the ball!

713
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:16,934
- Snap the ball!
- <i>There's the snap. It's over his head.</i>

714
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:19,558
<i>Bouncing around the carpet.
That was not pretty.</i>

715
00:39:19,683 --> 00:39:21,835
<i>Clark picks it up.
I don't know what he's going to do.</i>

716
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,527
<i>Oh, he shovels it forward.</i>

717
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,445
<i>Vince Howard on the outside.</i>

718
00:39:26,118 --> 00:39:27,823
Oh, what a move!
Just on the edge!

719
00:39:28,564 --> 00:39:30,450
Howard could go.
This could be it folks!

720
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:32,582
Oh my, touchdown!

721
00:39:32,856 --> 00:39:34,037
Touchdown, East Dillon!

722
00:39:36,171 --> 00:39:37,611
<i>Vince Howard has scored.</i>

723
00:39:37,736 --> 00:39:41,169
<i>Coach Taylor and the East Dillon Lions
are on the board.</i>

724
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:42,937
<i>Touchdown, hallelujah!</i>

725
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,924
Alright, Lions!

726
00:39:58,479 --> 00:39:59,688
How was your date?

727
00:40:01,253 --> 00:40:03,249
- It was good.
- It was?

728
00:40:03,549 --> 00:40:04,649
It was good.

729
00:40:06,109 --> 00:40:07,362
I've been thinking.

730
00:40:08,282 --> 00:40:10,282
I think I want you to come
to church with me,

731
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,951
'cause it makes me feel like family.

732
00:40:13,643 --> 00:40:17,437
And I like having you sit next to me,
at least for a little bit longer.

733
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:21,376
And I think it's good
that you're questioning your faith.

734
00:40:22,449 --> 00:40:24,989
I just want you to have faith
in something.

735
00:40:26,686 --> 00:40:28,216
Something that can hold you...

736
00:40:29,091 --> 00:40:31,497
when I'm not going to be able
to hold you anymore.

737
00:40:36,404 --> 00:40:38,276
I'll be there Sunday.

738
00:40:40,436 --> 00:40:43,786
I'm sorry, but you're always
going to be my little girl.

739
00:40:50,266 --> 00:40:51,266
Richard!

740
00:41:25,245 --> 00:41:27,596
- Get up!
- Ah, screw you.

741
00:41:29,277 --> 00:41:30,849
Alright, screw you, too.

742
00:41:33,646 --> 00:41:34,991
What are you doing?

743
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,824
I'm just looking at this thing.

744
00:41:38,136 --> 00:41:39,496
That's a piece of crap.

745
00:41:41,061 --> 00:41:42,791
That's a beautiful piece of crap.

746
00:41:43,589 --> 00:41:44,589
Thank you.

747
00:42:01,291 --> 00:42:03,019
I'll get the money together somehow.

748
00:42:04,757 --> 00:42:06,907
- I know you will.
- I love you.

749
00:42:08,326 --> 00:42:09,515
I love you, too.

750
00:42:11,442 --> 00:42:12,645
And you know what?

751
00:42:13,889 --> 00:42:16,852
Now that you've gotten
all the way through the game,

752
00:42:17,646 --> 00:42:19,870
you gotta feel
pretty good about that.

753
00:42:20,995 --> 00:42:23,017
Bet you'll sleep better tonight.
