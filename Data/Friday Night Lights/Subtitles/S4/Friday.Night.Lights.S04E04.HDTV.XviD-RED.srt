1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,267
- Hey, you got a boyfriend?
- No. Why?

2
00:00:01,302 --> 00:00:03,269
- 'cause that's the guy
that should be doing all this,

3
00:00:03,303 --> 00:00:04,770
Giving you rides everywhere.

4
00:00:04,805 --> 00:00:07,039
- Maybe it'd be more efficient
if you were my boyfriend.

5
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:08,240
- Got luke here, a new player.

6
00:00:08,275 --> 00:00:10,242
Y'all make sure
that he is welcome.

7
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:11,410
- You're a long way
from home, boy.

8
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:12,712
- I guess so.

9
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:14,413
- I'm julie,
matt's girlfriend.

10
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:16,148
- So you're the ball and chain
that keeps dragging him down.

11
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:18,584
- Do you think
I'm holding you back?

12
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:20,486
- No, you're the most important
thing in my life.

13
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,655
- If you can't finish games,
I can't keep this program going.

14
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,257
You turn it around,
or we gonna shut it down.

15
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:26,425
[cheering]

16
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,694
- Vince howard
puts the lions on the board

17
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:30,262
For their first touchdown.

18
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:32,598
[cheering]

19
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,071
- It's still
a sad state of affairs

20
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:40,506
For the panthers.

21
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,573
In a single week,

22
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:42,875
The team got a forfeit
on the books,

23
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:45,677
And a great player,
luke cafferty,

24
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,012
Shipped out of school.

25
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:48,213
Callers, you say what?

26
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:49,815
- Sammy, I got to correct you
on something.

27
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:51,750
That cafferty kid
wasn't shipped out.

28
00:00:51,784 --> 00:00:53,852
He was hand-delivered
by principal taylor

29
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,722
To east dillon,
her husband's team,

30
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:57,923
And everybody knows it.

31
00:00:57,957 --> 00:01:01,627
- [sighs]

32
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:02,895
- Taylor.

33
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:05,864
- Good morning, levi.

34
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:09,067
- I see you finished
the game last night,

35
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:10,602
Way to go.

36
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:13,205
Sis boom bah.
Rah, rah, rah.

37
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,874
- Hey, levi.
- Huh?

38
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:19,077
- Pep rallies...

39
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:20,512
They build excitement.

40
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:23,415
They're good for the school,
good for the team.

41
00:01:23,449 --> 00:01:26,218
- Pep rallies
don't cost, correct?

42
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,587
- Nope.

43
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:31,657
- Good.
Don't let me get in your way.

44
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:36,395
- Come on, how much
retyping you got to do?

45
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:39,965
Just put your test scores in,
tell them how awesome you are,

46
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:41,500
And we can move along.

47
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:42,701
- It's too long.

48
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:44,303
I have to cut it down
at least by half.

49
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:46,405
Did you hear that brown
used to make you

50
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,640
Handwrite your essays?
- Wow.

51
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:51,543
Well, that's so that they could
weed out the serial killers.

52
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:54,279
- [chuckles]

53
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:56,882
- So what's the, uh--what's
the final list of schools?

54
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:58,817
- Um...

55
00:01:58,851 --> 00:02:01,987
U.C. Berkeley,
u.C.S.B.,

56
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:04,690
Brown, amherst,

57
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:08,060
Um, mount holyoke,

58
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:10,762
N.Y.U.,

59
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,965
U.T. Austin--

60
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:14,633
Hook 'em horns.

61
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,335
[chuckles]

62
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,775
- Good splits, good splits!

63
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,544
Come off the ball, now.
Come off the ball.

64
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:27,579
- Step up.
Come on up.

65
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,982
- Fumble!
- Oh, man.

66
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,316
- Come on, now, 5.

67
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,118
- Get it together out there.
- What are you doing?

68
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:34,353
- Do you know how to read
the "d," man.?

69
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:35,454
Read the end, dude.

70
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,688
- That defensive end
didn't move.

71
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:38,023
- He did move.
You're supposed to take him.

72
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:39,791
- Next time, give me the ball
and get out my way.

73
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,126
- Come here, come here.
Shut up.

74
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,929
Shut your mouth.
Come here.

75
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:46,298
You read the end.
You stay in the pitch lane.

76
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,433
You keep your personal crap
off this field,

77
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:50,168
And you quit
letting me down

78
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:51,670
And quit letting
the team down,

79
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:53,839
'cause we are all
getting tired of it.

80
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:55,307
Is that understood?
- Yes, sir.

81
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,776
- Yes, sir.

82
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,046
- Let's go, now.
Come on.

83
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,648
- All right, huddle up.

84
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,049
Let's go.
Get in the huddle.

85
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,785
Good jab step, three-two.
Good jab step.

86
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:08,520
Good fake in there.
Now let's go.

87
00:03:08,554 --> 00:03:09,855
Right there.

88
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:11,523
[overlapping shouting]

89
00:03:11,557 --> 00:03:14,826
- Come on, now.
That's on you.

90
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,062
- What the hell?
You trying to be funny?

91
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:18,797
I didn't even have time
to make a move out there.

92
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:20,332
- I don't understand.
Why aren't you in the end zone?

93
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,401
I got out of your way.
- I will break you up, boy.

94
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:23,735
Next time
you give me the ball,

95
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:24,970
You make sure you mean
to give it to me.

96
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:26,705
[overlapping shouting]

97
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:28,073
You, you,
you're my problem.

98
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:29,808
- You're your problem
right now.

99
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:31,843
- No, you're my problem.
- That's enough.

100
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,133
- Yeah.

101
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:29,401
Deer and beer, here we come,
two days away.

102
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,535
Let's get after it, billy.

103
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,770
- Tim, what the hell
are you doing?

104
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:33,305
This is how accidents happen.

105
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:34,773
- Minds, I don't think
they're loaded. We're fine.

106
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:36,608
- Tim, just put them
in the corner or something.

107
00:04:36,642 --> 00:04:38,543
All right, she's not supposed
to have any stress right now.

108
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:39,978
- Where's the gun cleaner?

109
00:04:40,012 --> 00:04:43,415
- Why do you have
to clean your guns?

110
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,617
- Wait.

111
00:04:47,653 --> 00:04:49,621
You didn't tell her, did you?

112
00:04:49,655 --> 00:04:50,689
- I totally see now.

113
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:51,857
So y'all just get to go hunting

114
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:53,592
And get drunk
and leave me here by myself.

115
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:54,993
- No.
No, no, no, no, no.

116
00:04:55,027 --> 00:04:56,128
- I have an ultrasound
this week.

117
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:57,295
- I understand that.

118
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,064
And I want to be there
for that ultrasound.

119
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:00,665
- So I just get to shove this
fat ass behind a steering wheel

120
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,401
And drive myself to the doctor,
is that what's gonna happen?

121
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,636
- Baby, I will be there
for that ultrasound, okay?

122
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,171
Timmy and I
can go hunting anytime.

123
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:07,539
- No, we can't.

124
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:08,974
That's why it's called
hunting season, billy.

125
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:11,343
- Seriously, I'm gonna put
your head through a wall.

126
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:13,745
Would you shut up?

127
00:05:16,048 --> 00:05:17,816
[whistle blows]
- let's go.

128
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:23,488

130
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,630
Go!
Let's go!

131
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:32,664
Go!

132
00:05:32,698 --> 00:05:34,800
[players shout]

133
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,186
- All right, jokers.

134
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,489
Who took my wallet?

135
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,958
Seriously, it's not funny.

136
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:03,962
- You know what I do
when I lose something?

137
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:06,298
I retrace my steps.

138
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:08,633
Maybe that's what
you should do, retrace them.

139
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:09,968
- I didn't lose it.

140
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:11,636
It was in my locker,
and now it's missing.

141
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:12,737
- I mean, you want us
to get together?

142
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:13,772
We could help you
look for it if you want.

143
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:14,906
- All right, cut the crap.

144
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:16,208
Seriously, I'm not gonna
tell you again.

145
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:17,809
Give me my wallet back.

146
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:20,712
- You're so sure I took it.

147
00:06:20,746 --> 00:06:23,014
- Mm-hmm.

148
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:27,085
- Go and get it, then.

149
00:06:31,123 --> 00:06:32,757
- Oh, oh.

150
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:35,427
[overlapping shouting]

151
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:36,862
- All right, all right,
all right.

152
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,331
- I got a pep rally
to organize this week.

153
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:41,933
I have got papers to grade.
I've got a family to raise.

154
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:43,401
I've got a wife to love,

155
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:45,437
And then I've got
you two bozos,

156
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:47,339
Trying to teach
you two something

157
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:49,941
You seem just damned determined
not to learn.

158
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:53,645
What makes you think
he took your wallet?

159
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:55,146
- It's obvious, coach.
- It obvious?

160
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:56,815
You're gonna make a hell
of a lawyer, aren't you?

161
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:58,517
Do you know where
his wallet is?

162
00:06:58,551 --> 00:06:59,584
- No, sir.

163
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:00,986
- You don't know
where his wallet is?

164
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,521
- This is a bunch
of bull, coach.

165
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,589
- Hey, coach crowley!

166
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,224
- Yes, sir?

167
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,159
- Coach, would you take
these two gentlemen

168
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:09,427
To the gymnasium?

169
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:11,196
Have them run those stairs
for the next 30 minutes

170
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,998
Or until a wallet shows up,

171
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:14,466
Whichever one might come first.

172
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,201
- You bet.
- Thank you, coach.

173
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:18,069
Y'all enjoy.
- Let's go, boys.

174
00:07:22,808 --> 00:07:24,943

- 7.

177
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,086
- Riggs, what's up?

178
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,889
- Slinging dough instead
of 60-yard bombs now, huh?

179
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:39,624
No chicago?

180
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,426
- Nah, I kind of felt
like I should stay here,

181
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,527
Take care of my grandma.

182
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:44,129
- Right.

183
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:45,463
- San antonio?

184
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:47,232
- Negative.

185
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:48,934
- What else is new?

186
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,802
- You playing any ball?

187
00:07:50,836 --> 00:07:52,270
- No, not really.

188
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,239
I've been working with this
artist on some art stuff.

189
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:55,707
Yeah, and then working here,
you know?

190
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:57,642
- Right.
I forgot about that.

191
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:59,511
- You, uh, gonna be watching
any football this weekend?

192
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:02,914
- No, I'm going hunting
this weekend, my friend.

193
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,616
- Oh, yeah?
- Get me some whitetail.

194
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,051
Maybe wrestle down some boars.

195
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:08,820
- Nice.

196
00:08:08,854 --> 00:08:11,556
- That's my weekend.
- All right.

197
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:13,024
- Anyways,
it's good to see you.

198
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:14,826
- You too, buddy.
- Let's go for a beer sometime.

199
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:19,464
- Yeah, sure.

200
00:08:19,498 --> 00:08:22,567
Hey, riggins, actually, um...

201
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:26,171
Is it cool if maybe I go
hunting with you this weekend?

202
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:28,406
- You hunt?

203
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,609
- Well, I mean,
my--my dad took me

204
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:32,577
A couple times
when I was little.

205
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:34,946
- Thursday morning...

206
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:36,781
5:15.
- All right.

207
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:39,184
- See you there.
- Yeah, man.

208
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:41,753
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

209
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:44,556
- It's nasty.
It's nothing but used goods.

210
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,524
Oh, landry, hey.

211
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,027
- Hey. What's going on?
You know devin.

212
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:50,962
- Hi. Hi.
- Hello.

213
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,564
- How you doing?

214
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:54,265
- You have a car.

215
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,467
He hit me with it.

216
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:57,402
- Yeah, I heard about that.

217
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:58,937
- Yeah, we all know
about it.

218
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:00,972
- I think you should use
that car

219
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:02,874
To drop me and my friends off
to this party

220
00:09:02,908 --> 00:09:04,309
In kilroy tomorrow.

221
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:05,543
Yeah.

222
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:08,980
- That's an idea, huh?
- Yeah.

223
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:10,882
- Although I think
I might have to decline,

224
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:13,318
'cause I've kind of been down
that road before,

225
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:15,053
Where a girl asked me
to do something,

226
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:16,721
And I just kind of said yes.

227
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:18,256
And all of a sudden,
everyone's calling me a word

228
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:19,691
That I don't like to use.

229
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,293
- You're invited to the party.
You are too.

230
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,663
- Well, you could've just
said that to begin with.

231
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:26,331
- Thanks for the invitation.

232
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:27,666
- So you cool?
You want to come?

233
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,334
- Yeah, I think
that sounds great.

234
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:30,702
- It's gonna be a lot of fun.
- It's gonna be fun.

235
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,171
- All right, see you later.
- Okay, bye.

236
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:34,572
- Okay.
- All right.

237
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:37,108
- So you're gonna go
to a party in kilroy.

238
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:39,077
- Yeah, I am.
What is that?

239
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:40,545
Why with that tone?

240
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:42,847
- But I have to tell you
that when I die,

241
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:44,849
I hope people will say
that she gave

242
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:46,351
More than she took.

243
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:48,720
That would be
true success to me.

244
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:53,324
Mom.
I'm in.

245
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:54,659
- Oh, my god!

246
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:57,495
I could not be any prouder
of you, becky.

247
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,297
You make it look so easy,
and it's not.

248
00:09:59,331 --> 00:10:01,733
It is not easy at all.
It is such hard work.

249
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:02,934
- Thanks, mom.

250
00:10:02,968 --> 00:10:04,369
- You know what?
You need a new gown.

251
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:05,637
- Yeah?
- Absolutely.

252
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:07,872
A portrait neckline.

253
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:10,275
I know, how about tomorrow
before my shift,

254
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:12,410
We could go find
the perfect dress,

255
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,279
The perfect shoes,
and then get a bite to eat.

256
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:15,547
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

257
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:16,948
- Yeah, tomorrow's great.
- Okay.

258
00:10:16,982 --> 00:10:20,485
I can't wait to watch those
other girls eat your dust.

259
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:21,753
- I got to ask you something,

260
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:25,256
And I need you
to not be weird about it.

261
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,125
- What's up?

262
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,330
- There's this place
right outside of dillon

263
00:10:32,364 --> 00:10:34,799
Called steers,

264
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,835
And I was wondering
if you'd go there with me.

265
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:38,269
- Steers?

266
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,338
- It's--

267
00:10:40,372 --> 00:10:41,706
It's gay.

268
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:45,343
I mean, it's a gay place.

269
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:49,614
- Are you hitting on me?

270
00:10:49,648 --> 00:10:50,715
- No.

271
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,383
You're not my type.

272
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:55,754
- Oh, I'm not your type?

273
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:58,490
- Look, I just need somebody
to go there with me.

274
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:01,626
This is a new experience,
and it's kind of weird.

275
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:05,563
And it'd be nice
to have a friend go with me.

276
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,599
- I'll go.

277
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:10,502
See what your type is like.

278
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:11,936
[engine turning]

279
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:13,872
- Well, I think
where we need to focus

280
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:17,642
All our attention right now
is library, library, library.

281
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:20,945
It's been since 2005
since we've had any updates.

282
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,947
It'z where we should focus
our funds.

283
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:25,150
- Yeah, but, um, you know,
I'm--I'm really sorry.

284
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,318
Our budget is already
tapped out.

285
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,620
Maybe we can do this
next year.

286
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:29,954
- But, no, I mean, you know,

287
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:31,422
We had actually pushed it
last year,

288
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:32,891
And we had talked about
that this--

289
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:34,759
This would be where
our focus was this year.

290
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:35,960
- Look, there are
a lot of people

291
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:37,262
Who are pretty angry
out there, tami.

292
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:40,765
I mean, you realize
that a substantial portion

293
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,867
Of the school's revenue
is generated by football,

294
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:45,136
Don't you?

295
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:46,971
- Oh, so you mean
people are angry

296
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:49,374
Because I told luke cafferty
that he had to go

297
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:51,843
To the correct school
for his district?

298
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,578
That's why we're not gonna get
our library?

299
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:55,079
That seems like
a shame to me.

300
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:56,447
- Look, after what you did
with luke,

301
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:57,615
We're gonna be lucky

302
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,250
To reach half
the normal amount this year.

303
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:01,686
I mean, you cost yourself
and the school

304
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,056
Any chance we might have had
to improve that library.

305
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,724
Now, I'm sorry, tami,
if you'll excuse me,

306
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,359
I do have another meeting.

307
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:16,935
- [gasps]

308
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,206
What?

309
00:12:32,455 --> 00:12:34,589
- Hello, mr. Rc collins,
class of '79?

310
00:12:34,623 --> 00:12:38,660
Mr. Collins, I would like
to talk to you about football.

311
00:12:38,694 --> 00:12:39,994
I would like to talk to you

312
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:41,663
About east dillon
high school football

313
00:12:41,697 --> 00:12:43,598
And coach eric taylor.

314
00:12:43,632 --> 00:12:45,600
Hello?

315
00:12:48,037 --> 00:12:49,237
- Try the next one.

316
00:12:49,271 --> 00:12:51,373
- How's it going?
- Good.

317
00:12:51,407 --> 00:12:54,142
- What are you doing exactly?

318
00:12:54,176 --> 00:12:57,479
- We're looking up alumni from
the east dillon lions of past

319
00:12:57,513 --> 00:12:59,614
To try to get them
to join the pep rally.

320
00:12:59,648 --> 00:13:01,516
- Yeah, your husband
had the inspired idea

321
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,885
To make the pep rally
a sort of a homecoming.

322
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:05,754
- That is inspired.

323
00:13:05,788 --> 00:13:07,889
- The lions of east dillon
are not roaring.

324
00:13:07,923 --> 00:13:10,125
- He's not home.
- Try the nine, three--

325
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:12,293
- Honey, honey, come here.

326
00:13:12,328 --> 00:13:14,195
Come here.

327
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,464
- Hello, is this
mr. Eddie boare,

328
00:13:16,499 --> 00:13:17,866
Class of '79?

329
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,201
- Honey, you need food.
- Huh?

330
00:13:20,236 --> 00:13:22,003
- You need food
for these people.

331
00:13:22,037 --> 00:13:24,406
If you want to bring people in,
you got to make them some food,

332
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,108
Just like we do,
just like we've always done.

333
00:13:27,143 --> 00:13:29,978
- You offering to cook dinner?

334
00:13:30,012 --> 00:13:33,314
- Oh, lordy.
Well, perhaps I am.

335
00:13:33,349 --> 00:13:35,750
Perhaps I am offering
to cook dinner, babe, yeah.

336
00:13:35,785 --> 00:13:38,453
Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

337
00:13:38,487 --> 00:13:41,523
- Mm-hmm.

338
00:13:41,557 --> 00:13:42,857
You're welcome.

339
00:13:42,892 --> 00:13:45,794
- That's real sweet.

340
00:13:45,828 --> 00:13:48,096
- Thanks.
- Okay.

341
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:50,565
All right, well, I'm gonna
get myself ready for school.

342
00:13:50,599 --> 00:13:52,400
Y'all, good luck.
- Hi.

343
00:13:52,435 --> 00:13:54,135
- I'm stan traub,

344
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,937
Assistant coach.

345
00:13:55,971 --> 00:13:57,439
- Julie, daughter.

346
00:13:57,473 --> 00:13:58,973
[chuckles]
nice to meet you.

347
00:13:59,008 --> 00:14:00,842
- Hey, mom.

348
00:14:03,412 --> 00:14:06,481
Mom, are you ready to go?

349
00:14:19,495 --> 00:14:22,230
- What?

350
00:14:22,264 --> 00:14:24,098
- Can I borrow your truck?

351
00:14:24,133 --> 00:14:25,533
- No.
- Please.

352
00:14:25,568 --> 00:14:27,669
- You can't borr--you don't even
have your license.

353
00:14:27,703 --> 00:14:31,105
- I know how to drive.
- I don't care.

354
00:14:33,209 --> 00:14:35,410
- Thanks.

355
00:14:38,814 --> 00:14:40,582
- What's wrong?

356
00:14:43,118 --> 00:14:45,186
- My mom blew me off...

357
00:14:45,221 --> 00:14:46,554
Again.

358
00:14:48,824 --> 00:14:51,259
- There is a gay bar
in dillon?

359
00:14:51,293 --> 00:14:53,795
- It's not in dillon.
It's outside of dillon.

360
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:55,096
- It's the same difference.

361
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:57,765
- Mr. Matthew,
"za" is not a word.

362
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,334
- "za" is a word.

363
00:14:59,368 --> 00:15:01,302
And if you look at it,
it spells "za,"

364
00:15:01,337 --> 00:15:03,104
As in "pizza."

365
00:15:03,138 --> 00:15:05,206
It's vernacular
in certain places, but wait--

366
00:15:05,241 --> 00:15:06,441
- You are such a liar.

367
00:15:06,475 --> 00:15:08,176
- Don't try and distract me
from the fact

368
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:09,511
That you're going
to a gay bar.

369
00:15:09,545 --> 00:15:11,212
What are you gonna do
at--at a gay bar?

370
00:15:11,247 --> 00:15:14,582
- Dance and make out
with some chicks.

371
00:15:14,617 --> 00:15:15,917
- I-I knew it.

372
00:15:15,951 --> 00:15:17,752
I knew you wanted
to experiment.

373
00:15:17,786 --> 00:15:20,388
- No, I'm going for devin
to be her moral support.

374
00:15:20,422 --> 00:15:21,689
- Whatever,
I don't even care.

375
00:15:21,724 --> 00:15:23,591
I'm going hunting
with riggins anyway.

376
00:15:23,626 --> 00:15:24,692
- That's a joke.

377
00:15:24,727 --> 00:15:26,394
You're going hunting
with riggins?

378
00:15:26,428 --> 00:15:27,929
- It's not a joke.

379
00:15:27,963 --> 00:15:29,697
- So you're just gonna go shoot
some poor defenseless animals

380
00:15:29,732 --> 00:15:30,732
For the hell of it?

381
00:15:30,766 --> 00:15:33,134
- Uh...

382
00:15:33,168 --> 00:15:34,302
Yeah, well, to eat.

383
00:15:34,336 --> 00:15:35,370
- You are so much better
than that.

384
00:15:35,404 --> 00:15:36,638
Why would you stoop
to that level?

385
00:15:36,672 --> 00:15:38,306
- No, I'm not.
I'm not better than that.

386
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,541
- It's disgusting.
- Whoa, hold on.

387
00:15:39,575 --> 00:15:41,442
Hold the phone.
I live in dillon.

388
00:15:41,477 --> 00:15:42,977
And people in dillon,
what they do

389
00:15:43,012 --> 00:15:44,512
Is they go hunting
and shoot animals.

390
00:15:44,547 --> 00:15:45,780
That's just
the way it works.

391
00:15:45,814 --> 00:15:47,148
- That is an awful excuse,
first of all.

392
00:15:47,182 --> 00:15:48,149
And second of all,
I live in dillon.

393
00:15:48,183 --> 00:15:49,250
I don't go hunting.

394
00:15:49,285 --> 00:15:51,686
- You don't live
in dillon for long.

395
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,788
I need a word...

396
00:15:53,822 --> 00:15:55,390
Word.

397
00:15:55,424 --> 00:15:57,792
- Is this about
my college applications?

398
00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:02,363
- No, it's not about
your college applications.

399
00:16:02,398 --> 00:16:03,798
It's not even about you.

400
00:16:03,832 --> 00:16:06,434
I don't know why you think
everything's about you.

401
00:16:09,371 --> 00:16:11,439
- No.

402
00:16:11,473 --> 00:16:15,243
No.

403
00:16:15,277 --> 00:16:17,011
All of this says runner-up.

404
00:16:17,046 --> 00:16:20,949
None of this is good.

405
00:16:20,983 --> 00:16:23,117
- I'm sure your mom
wanted to be here for this.

406
00:16:23,152 --> 00:16:24,819
- Yeah, or she hooked up
with some dude.

407
00:16:24,853 --> 00:16:25,987
You know, whatever.

408
00:16:26,021 --> 00:16:27,221
- Hey, look, cut her some slack.
I'm sure--

409
00:16:27,256 --> 00:16:28,823
- Don't.

410
00:16:28,857 --> 00:16:30,658
[voice breaking]
okay, because every time

411
00:16:30,693 --> 00:16:32,627
Something really important
comes along,

412
00:16:32,661 --> 00:16:34,662
Every time, she does this.

413
00:16:34,697 --> 00:16:37,498
She has an emergency
or a date,

414
00:16:37,533 --> 00:16:39,434
Or she takes another shift
at that stupid bar.

415
00:16:39,468 --> 00:16:41,135
- Hey, look,
this one's nice.

416
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:43,871
It's pretty.

417
00:16:43,906 --> 00:16:45,840
- You think it's pretty?

418
00:16:45,874 --> 00:16:48,409
- Yeah.

419
00:16:48,444 --> 00:16:51,813
- Is that a portrait neckline?

420
00:16:51,847 --> 00:16:53,281
- Yeah.

421
00:16:53,315 --> 00:16:55,083
- This is stupid.
You don't even know.

422
00:16:55,117 --> 00:16:56,517
Can we go, please?

423
00:16:56,552 --> 00:16:58,386
- No, wait, we can't go.

424
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:01,189
We're here.
We got to pick something.

425
00:17:01,223 --> 00:17:02,790
And what's that saying?

426
00:17:02,825 --> 00:17:05,693
Doesn't the dress find you?

427
00:17:05,728 --> 00:17:09,497
- Can we please just go?
This was such a dumb idea.

428
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:17,171
- [sighs]

429
00:17:17,206 --> 00:17:19,040
I'm gonna tell you something,
all right?

430
00:17:19,074 --> 00:17:22,043
And you can't tell it
to anyone else.

431
00:17:25,781 --> 00:17:30,551
Well, my mother never took me
shopping for a pageant gown.

432
00:17:30,586 --> 00:17:33,721
And because of that...

433
00:17:33,756 --> 00:17:35,790
I never placed at miss texas.

434
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,562
That's why
I got into football.

435
00:17:41,597 --> 00:17:43,598
That's a fact.

436
00:17:46,735 --> 00:17:49,303
This is what
we're gonna do.

437
00:17:49,338 --> 00:17:52,607
We're gonna start
with the wheels,

438
00:17:52,641 --> 00:17:55,176
And then we'll work
our way up.

439
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:57,378
By then,
hopefully they'll have

440
00:17:57,413 --> 00:17:59,814
A new shipment
of dresses in.

441
00:17:59,848 --> 00:18:01,015
âª âª

442
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:03,518
- Hey, landry.

443
00:18:03,552 --> 00:18:05,687
Y'all, look at his shirt.

444
00:18:05,721 --> 00:18:07,689
- Oh, my god.
What does he have on?

445
00:18:07,723 --> 00:18:09,190
- How's it going?

446
00:18:09,224 --> 00:18:11,626
You all ready for some
good old-fashioned revelry?

447
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:14,128
- What's this music?

448
00:18:14,163 --> 00:18:16,397
- Oh, I'm glad you like it.
This is actually--

449
00:18:16,432 --> 00:18:18,566
It's this local band.
Their name is crucifictorious.

450
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,134
- Do we have to listen
to this the whole ride?

451
00:18:20,169 --> 00:18:22,136
I'm just saying.

452
00:18:22,171 --> 00:18:23,304
- You look nice.

453
00:18:23,338 --> 00:18:24,972
- Oh, thanks.
What's this music?

454
00:18:25,007 --> 00:18:26,407
- Here, hold on,
just give it a--

455
00:18:26,442 --> 00:18:28,543
âª âª

456
00:18:28,577 --> 00:18:30,011
- Feel his hair.

457
00:18:30,045 --> 00:18:31,713
It's like grass.

458
00:18:31,747 --> 00:18:33,848
[laughter]

459
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,584
[indistinct chatter]

460
00:18:43,726 --> 00:18:45,793
- Jess, you are looking
really good tonight.

461
00:18:45,828 --> 00:18:48,796
I'm surprised
to see you here.

462
00:18:48,831 --> 00:18:51,365
- Really?

463
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,102
- What's up with you?
What's your problem?

464
00:18:54,136 --> 00:18:56,704
- I ain't got
no problem with you.

465
00:18:56,739 --> 00:18:59,140
I think I'm the only person
who sees how disposable

466
00:18:59,174 --> 00:19:01,209
You treat girls.

467
00:19:01,243 --> 00:19:03,077
- Well, I can only
treat a girl

468
00:19:03,112 --> 00:19:06,013
How she allows me
to treat her.

469
00:19:06,048 --> 00:19:07,915
Maybe I been talking
to the wrong girls.

470
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,917
- See, now you're trying
to piss me off.

471
00:19:09,952 --> 00:19:12,854
- You're sitting here frontin'
like you don't--

472
00:19:12,888 --> 00:19:14,555
You don't think about me.

473
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:17,258
Not even a little bit?

474
00:19:19,194 --> 00:19:23,431
- You wish I thought
about you.

475
00:19:23,465 --> 00:19:26,434
I have a boyfriend.
- You got a boyfriend?

476
00:19:26,468 --> 00:19:32,173
âª âª

477
00:19:32,207 --> 00:19:33,608
- What's up with that, man?

478
00:19:33,642 --> 00:19:35,510
I know that ain't
that opie-looking dude

479
00:19:35,544 --> 00:19:37,812
I hit in football practice,
is it?

480
00:19:37,846 --> 00:19:39,280
- I guess so.

481
00:19:39,314 --> 00:19:42,049
- Looks like jess
hitting it now.

482
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,992
- Ah.

483
00:19:51,026 --> 00:19:53,227
It's over.

484
00:19:53,262 --> 00:19:55,730
I'm not a panther anymore.

485
00:19:55,764 --> 00:19:58,032
And it makes me--

486
00:19:58,066 --> 00:20:00,568
I feel ill.

487
00:20:00,602 --> 00:20:02,904
But I don't know why
I'm saying this to you.

488
00:20:02,938 --> 00:20:04,705
You know what it's like
to be a panther

489
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,975
And have it
taken away from you.

490
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:10,278
I'm sorry about it.

491
00:20:12,614 --> 00:20:15,183
I'm sorry
about all of it, eric.

492
00:20:20,489 --> 00:20:22,356
- Tami and I are having

493
00:20:22,391 --> 00:20:24,125
Some east dillon alumni over

494
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,328
This week for dinner.

495
00:20:27,362 --> 00:20:30,097
Why don't you
come over and join us?

496
00:20:33,836 --> 00:20:38,072
- You can't fake
"boosterism," eric.

497
00:20:38,106 --> 00:20:40,241
It comes from the heart.

498
00:20:42,544 --> 00:20:44,478
That's the beauty of it.

499
00:20:49,351 --> 00:20:50,518
- Hey, what's up, landry?

500
00:20:50,552 --> 00:20:52,286
I was surprised to see youat .

501
00:20:52,321 --> 00:20:53,788
You have fun?
- That was fun.

502
00:20:53,822 --> 00:20:54,956
That was a lot of fun.

503
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:57,124
Someone spilled something
on my shoes,

504
00:20:57,159 --> 00:20:58,926
But other than that,
it was fun.

505
00:20:58,961 --> 00:21:00,394
- You had a good time.
You was dancing and stuff.

506
00:21:00,429 --> 00:21:01,562
- Yeah, I had a good time.

507
00:21:01,597 --> 00:21:03,097
- Yeah, you had
a good time with jess?

508
00:21:03,131 --> 00:21:04,398
- Yeah.

509
00:21:04,433 --> 00:21:08,703
I mean, you know, just as...

510
00:21:08,737 --> 00:21:10,137
I was just her ride.

511
00:21:10,172 --> 00:21:13,374
- Really? 'cause she told me
you were her boyfriend.

512
00:21:13,408 --> 00:21:15,710
- Is--no.

513
00:21:15,744 --> 00:21:17,912
I'm definitely
not her boyfriend.

514
00:21:17,946 --> 00:21:19,113
She said that?

515
00:21:19,147 --> 00:21:20,882
- Yeah, she did.

516
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:23,384
- No.
That's crazy.

517
00:21:23,418 --> 00:21:26,888
- You're not lying to me,
are you?

518
00:21:26,922 --> 00:21:29,257
- No, I'm not.

519
00:21:30,926 --> 00:21:34,629
That's news to me.
[chuckles]

520
00:21:34,663 --> 00:21:36,264
- All right.

521
00:21:36,298 --> 00:21:37,932
You good.

522
00:21:37,966 --> 00:21:39,600
Be safe.

523
00:21:39,635 --> 00:21:41,435
- Okay.

524
00:21:43,505 --> 00:21:44,906
- Hey, how you doing?
- Hey.

525
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,808
- Uh...
- What'll it be?

526
00:21:47,843 --> 00:21:50,077
- You're not by chance
virgil merriweather?

527
00:21:50,112 --> 00:21:53,180
1983 state championship,
quarterback,

528
00:21:53,215 --> 00:21:54,649
East dillon lions?

529
00:21:54,683 --> 00:21:56,584
- What'll it be?

530
00:21:56,618 --> 00:21:58,819
- Well, I'll have

531
00:21:58,854 --> 00:22:01,122
A, uh, pound of brisket,
if you would, please.

532
00:22:01,156 --> 00:22:02,356
I'm eric taylor.

533
00:22:02,391 --> 00:22:03,958
I'm the new coach
over at east dillon.

534
00:22:03,992 --> 00:22:06,260
- $8.50.

535
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:09,730
- You don't by chance
rent this place out

536
00:22:09,765 --> 00:22:10,932
For events or anything,
do you?

537
00:22:10,966 --> 00:22:12,667
- Nope.

538
00:22:12,701 --> 00:22:14,001
- Well, that's too bad.

539
00:22:14,036 --> 00:22:16,837
We got our first pep rally,
homecoming coming up.

540
00:22:16,872 --> 00:22:19,640
- That's nice.

541
00:22:19,675 --> 00:22:21,909
- Look, this may sound odd,
but my wife and I

542
00:22:21,944 --> 00:22:24,211
Are having a dinner party
for some ex-lion players.

543
00:22:24,246 --> 00:22:25,980
- Nope.

544
00:22:26,014 --> 00:22:29,483
- I got some really great
kids on my team.

545
00:22:29,518 --> 00:22:30,685
They're good kids,

546
00:22:30,719 --> 00:22:32,520
And they could sure
use someone like you

547
00:22:32,554 --> 00:22:34,522
To come over and speak
some words to them.

548
00:22:34,556 --> 00:22:37,124
- Brisket will be out
in a few.

549
00:22:43,031 --> 00:22:44,799
- Hey, luke,
let me get this straight, man.

550
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:46,300
This guy steals your wallet,

551
00:22:46,335 --> 00:22:47,735
And you don't do anything
about it?

552
00:22:47,769 --> 00:22:49,570
- What do you want me to do?
- Get your wallet back.

553
00:22:49,604 --> 00:22:51,072
- Look, luke,

554
00:22:51,106 --> 00:22:53,808
I know east dillon's
like a prison or whatever,

555
00:22:53,842 --> 00:22:55,409
But I didn't think
you'd become someone's bitch.

556
00:22:55,444 --> 00:22:56,577
[laughter]

557
00:22:56,611 --> 00:22:58,679
- Hey, I know, right?

558
00:23:00,716 --> 00:23:02,683
- Stop the car.

559
00:23:02,718 --> 00:23:04,051
- What?
- Stop the car.

560
00:23:08,924 --> 00:23:10,791
- I see you brought
your boyfriends with you

561
00:23:10,826 --> 00:23:12,059
To help you look
for your wallet.

562
00:23:12,094 --> 00:23:13,995
- Why don't you shut up
and give it back?

563
00:23:14,029 --> 00:23:16,731
- You don't know
when to quit, do you?

564
00:23:16,765 --> 00:23:18,499
- Oh!

565
00:23:21,103 --> 00:23:22,403
- There you go, luke.
Take him down.

566
00:23:22,437 --> 00:23:24,238
- Don't know when to quit!

567
00:23:24,272 --> 00:23:25,473
[siren wails]

568
00:23:25,507 --> 00:23:27,475
- Come on.
Let's go.

569
00:23:27,509 --> 00:23:28,609
[siren wailing]

570
00:23:28,643 --> 00:23:30,811
- Go, go.
- Come on, man, let's go.

571
00:23:30,846 --> 00:23:32,013
- Forget him. Let's go.

572
00:23:35,617 --> 00:23:37,785
- Break it up, boys.
Break it up.

573
00:23:46,362 --> 00:23:47,662
- Hey, deacon,
how long have you

574
00:23:47,696 --> 00:23:48,997
Been over there
at bethel baptist?

575
00:23:49,031 --> 00:23:50,665
- 18 years.

576
00:23:50,699 --> 00:23:53,568
- That's a long time.

577
00:23:53,602 --> 00:23:56,004
- Coach taylor,
can I ask you something?

578
00:23:56,038 --> 00:23:57,071
- Yes, sir.

579
00:23:57,106 --> 00:23:58,540
- Why are we here?

580
00:23:58,574 --> 00:24:00,608
- Oh, lord have mercy, deacon.

581
00:24:00,643 --> 00:24:03,411
I'm trying to enjoy
my meal here.

582
00:24:03,445 --> 00:24:05,680
Man.

583
00:24:05,714 --> 00:24:09,050
- No, that's, uh--
that's a good question.

584
00:24:10,986 --> 00:24:12,787
Listen...

585
00:24:12,821 --> 00:24:15,256
I just started coaching
at this school.

586
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:17,225
I would imagine that you
would think of it

587
00:24:17,259 --> 00:24:18,726
As your high school too.

588
00:24:18,761 --> 00:24:20,562
With that said,

589
00:24:20,596 --> 00:24:24,666
We are facing--

590
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,935
I am facing a lot
of challenges over there.

591
00:24:26,969 --> 00:24:28,736
And we've got some problems
that I want--

592
00:24:28,771 --> 00:24:30,038
- With all due respect,

593
00:24:30,072 --> 00:24:31,806
People from your part of town

594
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,609
Pretty frequently tell us
about our problems,

595
00:24:34,643 --> 00:24:36,444
Our crime problems,
our education problems.

596
00:24:36,478 --> 00:24:38,580
You know how we got
these problems?

597
00:24:38,614 --> 00:24:40,748
Back in the '80s, the west side
of dillon got developed.

598
00:24:40,783 --> 00:24:43,284
They got the mall.
They got the hotel.

599
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:44,986
The west side of dillon
got the money.

600
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,788
- What did we get?
- We got forgotten.

601
00:24:46,822 --> 00:24:48,323
- We got
our high school closed.

602
00:24:48,357 --> 00:24:50,191
- And so listen, we thank you
for your hospitality,

603
00:24:50,225 --> 00:24:52,260
But I think I'm gonna
skip that lecture

604
00:24:52,294 --> 00:24:54,996
About our problems.

605
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:58,166
- Well, I know nobody
needs a lecture here,

606
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,467
That's for sure.

607
00:24:59,501 --> 00:25:01,502
- That's right.
- I think the truth is,

608
00:25:01,537 --> 00:25:03,504
We just--we just wanted
to get to know y'all

609
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:05,640
A little bit better,
and I was just hoping

610
00:25:05,674 --> 00:25:08,109
Y'all would get to know
my husband a little bit better,

611
00:25:08,143 --> 00:25:09,477
Because if there's
one thing about this man,

612
00:25:09,511 --> 00:25:10,812
He loves football.

613
00:25:10,846 --> 00:25:12,847
He loves football.
He loves those boys out there.

614
00:25:12,881 --> 00:25:14,015
Lives and breathes it.

615
00:25:14,049 --> 00:25:15,450
You know,
it's family to us.

616
00:25:15,484 --> 00:25:17,452
- Fact of the matter is
it's pretty damn hard

617
00:25:17,486 --> 00:25:19,420
Playing football when you've
got nobody out there

618
00:25:19,455 --> 00:25:22,590
Appreciating the effort
that you're putting into it.

619
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:25,760
- You like losing
with everybody watching?

620
00:25:25,794 --> 00:25:27,562
- Well, deacon, that's what
we're trying to fix.

621
00:25:27,596 --> 00:25:29,631
[doorbell chimes]
we're trying to fix that.

622
00:25:29,665 --> 00:25:31,099
- Hmm.

623
00:25:31,133 --> 00:25:32,834
- Hello.
- Oh, hey, buddy.

624
00:25:32,868 --> 00:25:35,269
How are you?
- How are you?

625
00:25:35,304 --> 00:25:36,638
- Is that buddy garrity?

626
00:25:36,672 --> 00:25:38,006
- You know buddy?

627
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,274
- Do I know buddy?
[chuckles]

628
00:25:40,309 --> 00:25:41,943
- Y'all,
this is buddy garrity.

629
00:25:41,977 --> 00:25:44,379
- Buddy garrity.
[laughter]

630
00:25:44,413 --> 00:25:47,415
- Mo hall,
you got to be kidding.

631
00:25:47,449 --> 00:25:49,017
Big mo lost some weight.

632
00:25:49,051 --> 00:25:51,285
- Nobody never hit harder
than buddy garrity,

633
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,620
I'll tell you.

634
00:25:52,655 --> 00:25:54,055
- Hey, buddy.

635
00:25:54,089 --> 00:25:56,024
- Damon gaston,
good to see you,

636
00:25:56,058 --> 00:25:57,558
Good to see you.
- Honey, buddy's here.

637
00:25:57,593 --> 00:25:58,559
- Buddy's here.

638
00:25:58,594 --> 00:26:00,061
- Hey.
- Hello, coach.

639
00:26:00,095 --> 00:26:02,296
- Hey, buddy, how are you?
It's good to see you.

640
00:26:02,331 --> 00:26:03,564
- Good to see you.
Good to see you.

641
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:04,565
Hello, deacon.

642
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:10,405
âª âª

643
00:26:10,439 --> 00:26:12,674
- So is this what you
expected it to be like?

644
00:26:12,708 --> 00:26:14,676
- Not exactly.

645
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:18,880
But I really like
the lighting in here.

646
00:26:18,914 --> 00:26:20,915
- [chuckles]

647
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:26,988
- I just don't know
how anybody meets anybody.

648
00:26:27,022 --> 00:26:30,725
- You are asking
the wrong person.

649
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:34,996
- But you've--you've got
the forever boyfriend, though.

650
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,631
- Yeah, well,

651
00:26:36,665 --> 00:26:39,033
Forever boyfriend is...

652
00:26:39,068 --> 00:26:40,401
I don't know.

653
00:26:40,436 --> 00:26:42,036
It's like he seems
pissed off

654
00:26:42,071 --> 00:26:43,705
About, like,
the stupidest things,

655
00:26:43,739 --> 00:26:45,339
And then we get
in these ridiculous arguments

656
00:26:45,374 --> 00:26:47,909
That go absolutely nowhere,
and it's like--

657
00:26:47,943 --> 00:26:50,344
It's like I don't know
how to fix us.

658
00:26:50,379 --> 00:26:53,948
It's like something that's
broken or--I don't know.

659
00:26:53,982 --> 00:26:55,783
You're not even
paying attention.

660
00:26:55,818 --> 00:26:57,185
What are you looking at?

661
00:26:57,219 --> 00:26:59,287
- Don't look over there.

662
00:26:59,321 --> 00:27:01,923
- Is that your type?

663
00:27:01,957 --> 00:27:05,626
She's cute.
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

664
00:27:05,661 --> 00:27:07,328
Don't flirt
while I'm gone, okay?

665
00:27:07,362 --> 00:27:11,232
- You know me.

666
00:27:11,266 --> 00:27:13,367
- Almost what?

667
00:27:13,402 --> 00:27:16,938
[laughs]

668
00:27:29,485 --> 00:27:32,086
- I was gonna help you
with those dishes,

669
00:27:32,121 --> 00:27:33,921
But I somehow got stuck
to the couch.

670
00:27:33,956 --> 00:27:35,523
- Mm-hmm,
so it seems.

671
00:27:35,557 --> 00:27:38,326
Thank you so much.
I think I got it.

672
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,027
- I almost made it
back in there.

673
00:27:40,062 --> 00:27:42,663
I just got
a little tired here.

674
00:27:42,698 --> 00:27:44,132
- Mmm.

675
00:27:44,166 --> 00:27:46,367
I heard deacon malone
say that he was gonna

676
00:27:46,401 --> 00:27:47,869
Make some calls for you.

677
00:27:47,903 --> 00:27:50,138
- That's because you make
a damn good steak,

678
00:27:50,172 --> 00:27:52,240
Is what it is.

679
00:27:54,376 --> 00:27:57,445
Hey.
- Hmm?

680
00:27:57,479 --> 00:28:00,548
- Thanks for tonight.

681
00:28:00,582 --> 00:28:02,984
- Don't thank me.
Thank buddy garrity.

682
00:28:03,018 --> 00:28:04,786
- Buddy garrity
ate all my damn steak.

683
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:07,421
- [chuckles]
he sure did.

684
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:12,326
- Hey, you know what?
- Hmm?

685
00:28:12,361 --> 00:28:14,929
- You're good at what you do.

686
00:28:14,963 --> 00:28:16,464
You wear a lot of hats.

687
00:28:16,498 --> 00:28:17,932
- Thank you.

688
00:28:24,106 --> 00:28:26,374
[phone rings]

689
00:28:26,408 --> 00:28:27,708
- Oh.

690
00:28:27,743 --> 00:28:29,510
- Goodness gracious.

691
00:28:29,545 --> 00:28:33,214
[ringing continues]

692
00:28:33,248 --> 00:28:34,816
- It's not buddy.

693
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:38,186
Hello?

694
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,453
Yes, sir.

695
00:28:42,057 --> 00:28:44,125
- The white kid,
he's got no record.

696
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:45,526
He can go.

697
00:28:45,561 --> 00:28:47,795
The black kid,
he's going to juvie.

698
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:50,131
- His name is vince.

699
00:28:50,165 --> 00:28:51,799
Has he made mistakes?

700
00:28:51,834 --> 00:28:53,501
Hell, yeah,
the kid's made mistakes.

701
00:28:53,535 --> 00:28:54,836
You know what, though?
He shows up.

702
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:56,504
He gets the job done.
He works hard.

703
00:28:56,538 --> 00:28:57,705
I vouch for him.

704
00:28:57,739 --> 00:28:59,373
All I'm asking, you give him
a second chance.

705
00:28:59,408 --> 00:29:02,543
- Coach, he's used up
his chances.

706
00:29:02,578 --> 00:29:03,644
- Can I see them?

707
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,046
Thank you.

708
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,814
- Coach, I can explain.
I didn't--

709
00:29:06,849 --> 00:29:08,983
- Shh.

710
00:29:09,017 --> 00:29:13,521
Just listen.

711
00:29:13,555 --> 00:29:16,490
We are at a crossroads
right now.

712
00:29:18,727 --> 00:29:22,230
You are gonna admit
that everything was your fault.

713
00:29:22,264 --> 00:29:23,731
- My dad--
- quiet.

714
00:29:23,765 --> 00:29:27,368
You are gonna cut
the tough-guy crap.

715
00:29:27,402 --> 00:29:29,503
You are both gonna say

716
00:29:29,538 --> 00:29:32,106
Exactly what
I tell you to say,

717
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,609
And we are gonna fix this.

718
00:29:34,643 --> 00:29:36,677
Understood?

719
00:29:36,712 --> 00:29:38,045
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

720
00:29:57,633 --> 00:30:00,835
- You get one chance
in life, fellas.

721
00:30:05,307 --> 00:30:08,476
You can either
take advantage of it,

722
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:12,213
Or you can piss it away.

723
00:30:12,247 --> 00:30:14,982
You do the latter,

724
00:30:15,017 --> 00:30:18,119
And you're gonna regret it
the rest of your lives.

725
00:30:21,757 --> 00:30:23,090
Get out.

726
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:25,159
[locks open]

727
00:30:25,193 --> 00:30:27,228
Get out of the car.

728
00:30:35,137 --> 00:30:36,570
- He really took off.

729
00:30:36,605 --> 00:30:39,173
He really did.

730
00:30:42,778 --> 00:30:45,680
- Hey, howard,
it's this way.

731
00:30:45,714 --> 00:30:47,715
- You sure?

732
00:30:53,488 --> 00:30:55,489
Thanks.

733
00:31:02,965 --> 00:31:04,966
- [scoffs]

734
00:31:12,841 --> 00:31:14,375
- Go, go, go, go.
Go. Go.

735
00:31:14,409 --> 00:31:16,043
Caleb, go ahead!
Beat him!

736
00:31:16,078 --> 00:31:18,379
[chuckles]

737
00:31:20,816 --> 00:31:23,417
Wait, y'all slow--
okay, be careful.

738
00:31:25,988 --> 00:31:27,254
- Lunches.

739
00:31:27,289 --> 00:31:28,622
Line up, line up, line up.

740
00:31:28,657 --> 00:31:29,857
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

741
00:31:29,891 --> 00:31:32,460
Pop! Pop! Pop!

742
00:31:32,494 --> 00:31:33,794
Hey, hey, come on,
get over here, boy.

743
00:31:33,829 --> 00:31:35,663
Come on over here.
Give me some.

744
00:31:35,697 --> 00:31:36,831
Ahh!
Go get on the bus.

745
00:31:36,865 --> 00:31:38,332
Hurry up, catch 'em.
Catch 'em, now.

746
00:31:38,367 --> 00:31:39,734
- Go get 'em!

747
00:31:39,768 --> 00:31:41,769
Daddy, they got pop warner
practice after school today.

748
00:31:41,803 --> 00:31:43,104
- Okay, you take your brothers,
and I'll make sure

749
00:31:43,138 --> 00:31:45,439
They get a ride
from mrs. Turner, all right?

750
00:31:45,474 --> 00:31:47,308
- Okay, you think maybe you can
stop by just for a second?

751
00:31:47,342 --> 00:31:49,176
- Look, go on before
you miss the bus.

752
00:31:50,912 --> 00:31:53,080
- Dada, I heard
what coach taylor

753
00:31:53,115 --> 00:31:55,883
Was talking to you about
the other day.

754
00:31:55,917 --> 00:31:57,618
- That ain't
your business, jess.

755
00:31:57,652 --> 00:32:00,888
- Daddy, oka
look, I'm sorry.

756
00:32:00,922 --> 00:32:02,790
I-I like football, okay?

757
00:32:02,824 --> 00:32:04,091
Andre loves football.

758
00:32:04,126 --> 00:32:05,926
Darius loves it so much,
he throws up

759
00:32:05,961 --> 00:32:08,529
Because he gets so nervous
before each game.

760
00:32:08,563 --> 00:32:09,764
But it's fine,
it really is.

761
00:32:09,798 --> 00:32:11,198
It's not your thing anymore.

762
00:32:11,233 --> 00:32:14,001
But it's still in us.

763
00:32:14,036 --> 00:32:16,170
We're still
a football family.

764
00:32:16,204 --> 00:32:17,605
- Jess, it ain't
for you to decide.

765
00:32:17,639 --> 00:32:19,573
- Daddy, I'm not trying
to decide anything.

766
00:32:19,608 --> 00:32:23,477
I'm just asking if we could
hold a pep rally here.

767
00:32:23,512 --> 00:32:26,013
It'd be fun, dad.

768
00:32:28,016 --> 00:32:30,051
- Get on before
you miss the bus.

769
00:32:31,787 --> 00:32:33,921
Go ahead,
take the boys to school.

770
00:32:33,955 --> 00:32:35,289
- Yes, sir.

771
00:32:39,761 --> 00:32:42,196
- I'm hoping we get something
over that fire tonight.

772
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:44,832
So keep the eyes peeled,
light feet.

773
00:32:44,866 --> 00:32:47,234
- What kind of things you think
we gonna--we gonna get?

774
00:32:47,269 --> 00:32:50,171
- Whitetail, boar.

775
00:32:52,941 --> 00:32:55,643
[gunshot]

776
00:32:55,677 --> 00:32:56,777
- 7, stop!
- What?

777
00:32:56,812 --> 00:32:59,213
- What was it?
- Well, I--

778
00:32:59,247 --> 00:33:02,817
I don't--I don't--
I don't know.

779
00:33:02,851 --> 00:33:04,852
- What do you mean
you don't know?

780
00:33:04,886 --> 00:33:06,053
The wind?

781
00:33:06,088 --> 00:33:07,421
- Well, I thought
I saw something,

782
00:33:07,456 --> 00:33:09,023
But I think it might have
been the wind.

783
00:33:09,057 --> 00:33:10,891
- So you're shooting--
give me that.

784
00:33:10,926 --> 00:33:12,359
- Hey!
- No gun.

785
00:33:12,394 --> 00:33:14,428
No gun.

786
00:33:16,898 --> 00:33:19,567
- Really? Come on,
let me have my gun back.

787
00:33:19,601 --> 00:33:23,537
- The number's 555-0101.

788
00:33:23,572 --> 00:33:26,440
- Sammy, this year the panthers
were destined for greatness.

789
00:33:26,475 --> 00:33:28,342
But now we got
to run the table

790
00:33:28,376 --> 00:33:30,144
Just to make it
to the playoffs.

791
00:33:30,178 --> 00:33:32,513
You ask me, tami taylor
should send a resignation

792
00:33:32,547 --> 00:33:35,449
And a written apology.

793
00:33:35,484 --> 00:33:43,457
âª âª

794
00:33:43,492 --> 00:33:45,493
- Come on, y'all.

795
00:33:48,797 --> 00:33:51,599
I just did what was right!
I did what I had to do!

796
00:33:51,633 --> 00:33:54,502
I'm sorry I messed up
football for everybody!

797
00:33:54,536 --> 00:34:02,910
âª âª

798
00:34:02,944 --> 00:34:05,112
Hey.

799
00:34:05,147 --> 00:34:07,081
I need some chocolate, please.

800
00:34:09,951 --> 00:34:12,186
So am I your boyfriend?

801
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:14,655
'cause it--it really seemed
like vince thought

802
00:34:14,689 --> 00:34:16,190
That I was your boyfriend.

803
00:34:16,224 --> 00:34:18,025
He said that
that's what you said.

804
00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:19,927
- I didn't say that
to him at all.

805
00:34:19,961 --> 00:34:22,096
I just said
I had a boyfriend.

806
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:23,564
- Oh, okay.

807
00:34:23,598 --> 00:34:25,199
Just wanted to clear that up.

808
00:34:25,233 --> 00:34:26,233
- But it's not like
we're dating,

809
00:34:26,268 --> 00:34:27,902
So what does it really matter?

810
00:34:27,936 --> 00:34:29,837
We're not.
- Okay, 100% not.

811
00:34:29,871 --> 00:34:30,838
Both: All right.

812
00:34:30,872 --> 00:34:32,439
- See you later.

813
00:34:35,143 --> 00:34:38,045
- College.

814
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:41,248
I'll tell you
what college was like.

815
00:34:41,283 --> 00:34:44,919
7:00 a.M. Mandatory wake-up.

816
00:34:44,953 --> 00:34:48,255
Then these fantastic
one-on-ones

817
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:50,090
With this robotic coach
that tells you

818
00:34:50,125 --> 00:34:52,092
What you're doing wrong
every single day--

819
00:34:52,127 --> 00:34:53,394
Nothing like coach taylor.

820
00:34:53,428 --> 00:34:55,729
We were spoiled.

821
00:34:55,764 --> 00:34:57,164
Plus, college is boring,

822
00:34:57,199 --> 00:34:59,833
And you get a curfew
every night.

823
00:35:03,038 --> 00:35:05,039
- You miss lyla, though?

824
00:35:08,476 --> 00:35:12,379
- I think we had
different paths.

825
00:35:12,414 --> 00:35:13,514
- So does that mean yes?

826
00:35:13,548 --> 00:35:14,748
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

827
00:35:14,783 --> 00:35:15,749
- Yeah.

828
00:35:15,784 --> 00:35:17,851
How about you?
How's dillon?

829
00:35:17,886 --> 00:35:19,420
- It's okay.

830
00:35:19,454 --> 00:35:23,290
Not as bad
as I thought it'd be.

831
00:35:23,325 --> 00:35:25,292
I mean, I'm getting to spend
a lot of time with my grandma,

832
00:35:25,327 --> 00:35:26,794
So that's good.

833
00:35:26,828 --> 00:35:28,996
And I don't know, I make a lot
more money delivering pizzas

834
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:31,031
With tips and stuff
than I used to make

835
00:35:31,066 --> 00:35:32,900
Over at the alamo freeze.

836
00:35:35,003 --> 00:35:38,005
- So basically you stayed
in dillon 'cause of jules.

837
00:35:40,508 --> 00:35:41,775
- Yeah.

838
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:45,045
- Yeah.

839
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,748
- Now she's--she's applying
to colleges and stuff, right?

840
00:35:47,782 --> 00:35:49,116
And I knew that was
gonna happen.

841
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:51,352
Obviously, I knew that she
was gonna go to college,

842
00:35:51,386 --> 00:35:53,053
But I guess
I just never realized

843
00:35:53,088 --> 00:35:55,089
The fact that all the colleges
she was gonna be applying to

844
00:35:55,123 --> 00:35:57,791
Were, like, on the other side
of the country.

845
00:35:59,628 --> 00:36:02,863
And now, you know, I started
just getting mad at her

846
00:36:02,897 --> 00:36:03,964
For no reason.

847
00:36:03,999 --> 00:36:05,766
It's like I resent it,

848
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,235
But she never asked me
to stay here, you know?

849
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:09,970
That was my decision.

850
00:36:10,005 --> 00:36:13,073
I decided to do that.

851
00:36:13,108 --> 00:36:15,109
I decided that.

852
00:36:17,279 --> 00:36:20,214
Well...

853
00:36:20,248 --> 00:36:24,151
Texas forever, right?

854
00:36:24,185 --> 00:36:25,919
- Yes.
Absolutely.

855
00:36:25,954 --> 00:36:27,955
Texas forever, 7.

856
00:36:36,665 --> 00:36:39,233
- I don't know
why he changed his mind.

857
00:36:39,267 --> 00:36:41,468
- Well, I think it's gonna be
a great pep rally.

858
00:36:41,503 --> 00:36:43,971
- We'll see about that.
Watch your step.

859
00:36:44,005 --> 00:36:46,440
- Hey, if it's not great,

860
00:36:46,474 --> 00:36:49,810
You still get
to come home with us.

861
00:36:49,844 --> 00:36:52,313
- There's always that.
- There's always that, right?

862
00:36:52,347 --> 00:36:54,048
Go ahead.

863
00:36:54,082 --> 00:37:02,389
âª âª

864
00:37:33,188 --> 00:37:34,922
- Hey.

865
00:37:34,956 --> 00:37:37,124
- Hey.

866
00:37:37,158 --> 00:37:38,258
Where's your brisket?

867
00:37:38,293 --> 00:37:41,528
- Oh, um,
I don't eat meat.

868
00:37:41,563 --> 00:37:43,263
- Oh, come on, let me
go get you a plate.

869
00:37:43,298 --> 00:37:44,465
- It's okay.

870
00:37:44,499 --> 00:37:46,066
Um, I actually
kind of wanted to talk to you

871
00:37:46,101 --> 00:37:47,201
About the other night.

872
00:37:47,235 --> 00:37:49,536
Um, I just wanted
to let you know

873
00:37:49,571 --> 00:37:51,839
That I'm not gonna
tell anybody or anything.

874
00:37:51,873 --> 00:37:54,341
- Tell anybody what?

875
00:37:54,376 --> 00:37:55,843
- I want to thank everybody
for coming out...

876
00:37:55,877 --> 00:37:57,177
- Uh, it's okay.

877
00:37:57,212 --> 00:37:58,946
- To east dillon's
first pep rally of the year.

878
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,447
[cheers and applause]

879
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:04,184
I'd like to introduce

880
00:38:04,219 --> 00:38:06,887
One of texas' great
high school football teams--

881
00:38:06,921 --> 00:38:10,023
1983 state champions
from east dillon high...

882
00:38:10,058 --> 00:38:12,226
[cheers and applause]

883
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,495
And what they brought home
to this school

884
00:38:14,529 --> 00:38:15,796
26 years ago.

885
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:17,765
[applause]

886
00:38:17,799 --> 00:38:18,866
Come on up, guys.

887
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,634
- Yeah!

888
00:38:20,668 --> 00:38:23,971
- Let us pray.

889
00:38:24,005 --> 00:38:27,341
Lord...

890
00:38:27,375 --> 00:38:29,977
We are gathered here today

891
00:38:30,011 --> 00:38:33,547
For a reason.

892
00:38:33,581 --> 00:38:38,519
We ask you, lord,
what is a group of lions?

893
00:38:38,553 --> 00:38:42,356
It is a pride.

894
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:46,326
And we stand before you
today, lord,

895
00:38:46,361 --> 00:38:48,562
Your pride.

896
00:38:50,398 --> 00:38:54,401
We need pride in this world.

897
00:38:54,436 --> 00:38:55,536
[man shouts]

898
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:58,038
- And what do we have here?

899
00:38:58,072 --> 00:39:00,007
I said, "what do we have here?"

900
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:02,042
All: Pride!

901
00:39:02,076 --> 00:39:03,444
[cheers and applause]

902
00:39:07,081 --> 00:39:09,316
We are the lions.

903
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:13,654
And we stand together.

904
00:39:13,688 --> 00:39:15,589
Who are we?

905
00:39:15,623 --> 00:39:17,724
All: Lions!
- Who are we?

906
00:39:17,759 --> 00:39:19,226
All: Lions!

907
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,395
[cheers and applause]

908
00:39:40,715 --> 00:39:41,882
- This--yeah.

909
00:39:41,916 --> 00:39:43,250
Put this one there.

910
00:39:43,284 --> 00:39:45,752
I never really wash this.

911
00:39:45,787 --> 00:39:47,421
It's kind of weird.
I just--

912
00:39:47,455 --> 00:39:55,429
âª âª

913
00:40:09,844 --> 00:40:12,913
- We're not dating, right?

914
00:40:12,947 --> 00:40:14,414
âª âª

915
00:40:14,449 --> 00:40:17,851
- Definitely not.
No.

916
00:40:17,886 --> 00:40:25,192
âª âª

917
00:40:49,951 --> 00:40:52,119
- Lorraine, I'm tossing
this half-and-half.

918
00:40:52,153 --> 00:40:54,588
- Well, all right, but we're
gonna have to go to the store.

919
00:40:54,622 --> 00:40:56,523
I cannot drink coffee
without cream.

920
00:40:56,558 --> 00:40:57,691
- Well, me neither.

921
00:40:57,725 --> 00:40:59,793
- Oh, I remember how you took
your coffee.

922
00:40:59,827 --> 00:41:01,328
[knock at door]

923
00:41:01,362 --> 00:41:04,531
Well, who could that be?

924
00:41:04,566 --> 00:41:06,800
[scoffs]
you failed me.

925
00:41:06,834 --> 00:41:08,535
âª âª

926
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:09,803
- Mrs. Saracen?

927
00:41:09,837 --> 00:41:17,844
âª âª

928
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,928
- Thanks.

929
00:41:34,963 --> 00:41:42,970
âª âª

930
00:41:51,145 --> 00:41:52,913
Hey, uh, look.

931
00:41:52,947 --> 00:41:56,083
I'm sorry, you know, that
I just stopped by, but I--

932
00:41:56,117 --> 00:41:59,486
What's the matter?

933
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,254
- Have you talked to your mom?

934
00:42:01,289 --> 00:42:04,524
- Why?

935
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:07,561
Is it--is--is something wrong
with grandma?

936
00:42:07,595 --> 00:42:09,429
- I'm sorry.

937
00:42:09,464 --> 00:42:12,232
- What's the matter?

938
00:42:12,266 --> 00:42:14,167
Julie.

939
00:42:14,202 --> 00:42:17,170
- It's your dad.

940
00:42:17,205 --> 00:42:19,940
He was killed.

941
00:42:19,974 --> 00:42:23,410
Sorry.

942
00:42:23,444 --> 00:42:24,811
I'm sorry.

943
00:42:24,846 --> 00:42:26,847
I'm sorry.
