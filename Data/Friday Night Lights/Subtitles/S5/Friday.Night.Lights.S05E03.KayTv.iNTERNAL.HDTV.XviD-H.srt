00:08:52,889 --> 00:08:55,524
You move your ass!
Nobody told you to slow down.

175
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:58,161
Y'all enjoy
that party this week?

176
00:08:58,195 --> 00:08:59,362
Y'all see the video?

177
00:08:59,396 --> 00:09:01,064
I know everyone else
in town did.

178
00:09:01,098 --> 00:09:03,600
Including that girl's parents,

179
00:09:03,634 --> 00:09:07,037
including her church members,
and her classmates.

180
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,238
Bring 'em over here, coach.

181
00:09:09,273 --> 00:09:11,373
Bring it in!

182
00:09:11,407 --> 00:09:13,542
Now, now, now!

183
00:09:13,576 --> 00:09:14,976
Let's go!

184
00:09:18,982 --> 00:09:21,282
You know what it is, fellas?
It's just damn shameful.

185
00:09:21,317 --> 00:09:23,084
That's what it is.

186
00:09:23,118 --> 00:09:25,720
And it's not gonna happen
out here again.

187
00:09:25,754 --> 00:09:28,789
You act like a bunch of thugs,
it reflects on all of us.

188
00:09:28,824 --> 00:09:30,625
I'm not holding you
to a higher standard.

189
00:09:30,659 --> 00:09:32,726
I'm holding you to our standard!

190
00:09:32,761 --> 00:09:34,294
Why you keep putting
everything on us,

191
00:09:34,328 --> 00:09:35,829
like we were
the only ones there?

192
00:09:35,863 --> 00:09:37,230
Coach, the whole school
was at that party.

193
00:09:37,264 --> 00:09:39,598
If you two don't know
the answer to that,

194
00:09:39,633 --> 00:09:41,667
you're dumber than you look.

195
00:09:41,701 --> 00:09:43,102
Is there anybody out here

196
00:09:43,136 --> 00:09:45,304
that doesn't understand
what our standard entails?

197
00:09:45,338 --> 00:09:47,406
No, sir.

198
00:09:47,441 --> 00:09:50,676
Y'all look at me
right in the eye.

199
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:55,948
Anyone, and I mean anyone...

200
00:09:55,982 --> 00:09:58,917
Who breaks our standard
will be off this team,

201
00:09:58,952 --> 00:10:01,553
and that is a promise.

202
00:10:05,324 --> 00:10:07,458
Get 'em back to it, coach.

203
00:10:07,493 --> 00:10:09,260
Let's go,
back in your lines, let's go!

204
00:10:09,295 --> 00:10:11,963
- Come on, let's go!
- Come on!

205
00:10:17,836 --> 00:10:21,473
[Muffled conversation]

206
00:10:21,507 --> 00:10:23,709
[Laughter]
You remember that, huh?

207
00:10:23,743 --> 00:10:26,178
- What you got up in there?
- Got some dressing...

208
00:10:26,212 --> 00:10:28,280
[Man laughing]
To put up on this...

209
00:10:28,314 --> 00:10:29,515
Okay?

210
00:10:29,549 --> 00:10:32,351
[Man laughing]

211
00:10:32,385 --> 00:10:35,288
Like old times?
Like old times.

212
00:10:35,322 --> 00:10:37,224
Hey, baby.

213
00:10:37,258 --> 00:10:39,459
- Oh...
- Um...

214
00:10:39,493 --> 00:10:41,795
Look at you. Ha.

215
00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:45,132
Say hi to your father, babe.

216
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,334
What's happening, little bread?

217
00:10:47,368 --> 00:10:49,803
I ain't so little no more.

218
00:10:49,838 --> 00:10:52,272
Ha ha, no, you all grown up.

219
00:10:52,307 --> 00:10:55,976
All right,
no more little kid names.

220
00:10:56,011 --> 00:10:58,679
What's happening, Vince?

221
00:10:58,713 --> 00:11:00,614
What's up, man?

222
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,922
Um, so listen, babe, Vince,
I got us some chicken,

223
00:11:08,957 --> 00:11:10,358
like old time's sake.

224
00:11:10,392 --> 00:11:11,992
What else we have?
We have some greens.

225
00:11:12,027 --> 00:11:15,397
Let's just do like we...
You know, like we used to.

226
00:11:15,431 --> 00:11:17,999
- I missed your cooking.
- I know that's right.

227
00:11:18,034 --> 00:11:20,268
- What the hell is this?
- What?

228
00:11:20,303 --> 00:11:23,704
- What's that?
- That's my suitcase, man.

229
00:11:28,109 --> 00:11:31,111
You didn't tell him.

230
00:11:31,145 --> 00:11:34,547
She didn't tell me
you were staying here.

231
00:11:36,951 --> 00:11:39,619
Uh, baby, just...
just go wash your hands.

232
00:11:39,653 --> 00:11:42,922
Baby, please.
Vince. Vince.

233
00:11:50,065 --> 00:11:51,466
Let's talk about
what happens in your body

234
00:11:51,501 --> 00:11:53,102
when you consume alcohol.

235
00:11:53,136 --> 00:11:55,805
One or two drinks

236
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,641
can impair your reasoning
and emotions,

237
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:02,446
which means you can decide
to do some dumb things

238
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,980
like drink more.
[Girls chattering]

239
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:07,150
As more alcohol
is consumed in the body,

240
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,786
your vision and speech
are impaired,

241
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,789
as well as your reflexes
and balance.

242
00:12:12,823 --> 00:12:15,458
Alcohol is a drug,
and it affects your brain,

243
00:12:15,493 --> 00:12:18,261
- Your heart, your lungs...
- 'Scuse me, Ms. Rene.

244
00:12:18,295 --> 00:12:20,796
Can I just interrupt you
for one second, please?

245
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,899
Y'all, I need to ask you
to put away the brush,

246
00:12:22,933 --> 00:12:24,667
put away the cell phones,

247
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:26,770
and pay attention.

248
00:12:26,804 --> 00:12:28,371
Mr. Burnwell
has brought this woman here

249
00:12:28,406 --> 00:12:31,107
to give you information
that you need.

250
00:12:31,142 --> 00:12:32,943
I know y'all...
at least some of you...

251
00:12:32,977 --> 00:12:34,377
have seen that video.

252
00:12:34,412 --> 00:12:39,116
It is sad, and it is disturbing.
I'm sure you will agree.

253
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:42,986
It's sad to see a girl
throwing up her guts.

254
00:12:45,256 --> 00:12:47,391
It's disturbing to see a girl

255
00:12:47,425 --> 00:12:50,327
being passed around at a party
like a rag doll.

256
00:12:50,361 --> 00:12:54,164
You think that's funny?

257
00:12:54,198 --> 00:12:57,166
I think that's awful.

258
00:12:57,201 --> 00:12:59,168
This discussion is part of...

259
00:12:59,203 --> 00:13:01,237
- Boring!
- A larger conversation...

260
00:13:01,271 --> 00:13:03,707
Excuse me?

261
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:06,042
What was that?

262
00:13:08,446 --> 00:13:11,048
You don't deserve to have
this conversation.

263
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:12,616
You can leave.

264
00:13:20,127 --> 00:13:22,228
You need to take care
of yourselves.

265
00:13:22,262 --> 00:13:24,263
'Cause one day real soon,

266
00:13:24,298 --> 00:13:27,667
there is not gonna be
anybody else to do it for you.

267
00:13:27,701 --> 00:13:32,272
I suggest you take
this opportunity and you listen.

268
00:13:32,306 --> 00:13:36,410
- Guys, guys, guys...
- Look at me, I'm a puppet!

269
00:13:36,445 --> 00:13:38,546
Look at me flappin' my arms!

270
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:41,182
Let's go.
Back in your group, let's go!

271
00:13:41,216 --> 00:13:42,416
Let's go, let's go!

272
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:44,985
- [Laughing]
- Hey, hey!

273
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,388
What the hell are you doin'?

274
00:13:48,422 --> 00:13:51,391
What the hell is that?

275
00:13:52,827 --> 00:13:53,927
You not hear what I said
yesterday?

276
00:13:53,961 --> 00:13:55,361
Was I not clear enough
yesterday?

277
00:13:55,396 --> 00:13:59,132
Jacob, you ever known me
to break a promise?

278
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:02,936
Wade, you ever known me
not to keep my promise?

279
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:06,406
Grab your helmets.
Get off this field.

280
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,974
Now!

281
00:14:13,816 --> 00:14:16,184
Get on the 50-yard-line
right now.

282
00:14:16,219 --> 00:14:17,753
Call it, coach!

283
00:14:17,787 --> 00:14:20,956
Two groups.
Spread out.

284
00:14:22,926 --> 00:14:25,694
It's a C-minus,
and I really have no idea why.

285
00:14:25,729 --> 00:14:29,431
What's wrong with it?

286
00:14:29,466 --> 00:14:30,933
There's nothing wrong it.

287
00:14:30,967 --> 00:14:33,001
I just feel like I've spent
a little time with you now,

288
00:14:33,035 --> 00:14:34,936
and there's more
to your thoughts

289
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:37,304
than you managed
to get on the page, that's all.

290
00:14:37,339 --> 00:14:39,773
Is it badly written?
Is it unclear?

291
00:14:39,807 --> 00:14:41,341
It felt safe.

292
00:14:43,277 --> 00:14:45,946
I think there's a very
interesting mind in there.

293
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,849
I just want you to feel
comfortable exercising it.

294
00:14:48,883 --> 00:14:51,551
Take some chances.

295
00:14:51,586 --> 00:14:53,820
So that's what college is for.

296
00:14:53,855 --> 00:14:55,756
First semester.

297
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:58,425
Look, it can take a while
to get your bearings.

298
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,161
You will.

299
00:15:00,195 --> 00:15:02,062
Okay.

300
00:15:04,966 --> 00:15:06,434
Hey, Julie.

301
00:15:06,468 --> 00:15:08,302
I've got an idea.

302
00:15:08,336 --> 00:15:11,271
Professor Nevins
holds these weekly salons

303
00:15:11,306 --> 00:15:13,206
for promising students.

304
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,175
I think you'd be great for it.
You interested?

305
00:15:17,478 --> 00:15:19,345
Um...

306
00:15:19,379 --> 00:15:20,580
Sure.

307
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:26,319
Y'all get on to
class now, okay?

308
00:15:26,353 --> 00:15:28,054
Hi, Jess.

309
00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:30,790
Hey, Mrs. Taylor.

310
00:15:30,825 --> 00:15:33,527
Hey, I'm sorry about
all of this today.

311
00:15:33,561 --> 00:15:35,362
Oh, you know...

312
00:15:35,396 --> 00:15:38,132
And if it means anything,
I was listening.

313
00:15:38,167 --> 00:15:40,835
Well, I'm glad.
It does mean something to me.

314
00:15:40,869 --> 00:15:43,571
- Thank you, Jess.
- Okay. You're welcome.

315
00:15:43,606 --> 00:15:46,207
- I tell you, these rally girls...
- Eh...

316
00:15:46,241 --> 00:15:48,242
And then I can
kind of understand them.

317
00:15:48,277 --> 00:15:52,680
'Cause everybody just wants
to feel a part of the team.

318
00:15:54,183 --> 00:15:56,551
Hey, Jess.

319
00:15:56,585 --> 00:15:58,753
- Come here.
- Yeah?

320
00:16:01,423 --> 00:16:02,590
I know coach is lookin' for

321
00:16:02,624 --> 00:16:03,858
an equipment manager
on the team.

322
00:16:03,892 --> 00:16:05,159
Mm-hmm.

323
00:16:05,194 --> 00:16:08,163
How would you like to be
equipment manager?

324
00:16:08,197 --> 00:16:10,131
Really?
You serious?

325
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,867
I mean, I don't know.
I don't know.

326
00:16:11,901 --> 00:16:13,768
- I'd have to ask him.
- I'd be great!

327
00:16:13,802 --> 00:16:15,470
I'd be better than anyone else!

328
00:16:15,504 --> 00:16:18,240
I think you would.
I'll tell him that.

329
00:16:18,274 --> 00:16:20,609
Okay. And tell him, too,
I'm really good with technique,

330
00:16:20,643 --> 00:16:23,244
'cause I, like, worked
with Vince over the summer.

331
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,746
I'm not making any promises.
I don't know.

332
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,848
Okay. You're...
Thank you!

333
00:16:26,882 --> 00:16:28,015
[Laughs] Yeah, you're welcome.

334
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,016
All right.

335
00:16:29,051 --> 00:16:30,218
We got everyone in here?

336
00:16:30,252 --> 00:16:31,752
Boys: Yes, sir.

337
00:16:31,787 --> 00:16:33,788
Go ahead,
take a knee if you want to.

338
00:16:37,092 --> 00:16:39,160
I'm not so sure
there aren't a few more of you

339
00:16:39,194 --> 00:16:41,029
that ought be kicked
off this team,

340
00:16:41,063 --> 00:16:43,731
maybe even
kicked outta the school.

341
00:16:43,766 --> 00:16:45,399
Maybe even the state of Texas!

342
00:16:45,434 --> 00:16:47,668
People are watchin' us.

343
00:16:47,703 --> 00:16:50,137
And it's just as important
what we do on the field

344
00:16:50,172 --> 00:16:52,574
as what we do off the field.

345
00:16:52,608 --> 00:16:54,609
Y'all know that.

346
00:16:54,644 --> 00:16:57,947
Tell you what we're gonna do.
We're gonna have a clean slate.

347

You were in a supply closet.

519
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:25,792
That's where they keep mops

520
00:24:25,826 --> 00:24:28,795
and brooms
and computer paper and...

521
00:24:28,829 --> 00:24:30,764
There's some rats in there.

522
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,667
Isn't that romantic?

523
00:24:33,702 --> 00:24:37,506
This is gonna get around
now, too.

524
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,807
And before you know it,

525
00:24:38,841 --> 00:24:40,776
you're gonna have yourself
quite a reputation.

526
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:42,845
Is that what you want?

527
00:24:42,879 --> 00:24:44,580
'Cause I happen to know
you're smart

528
00:24:44,614 --> 00:24:47,883
and I can see
that you're beautiful,

529
00:24:47,918 --> 00:24:49,218
and this is a time right now

530
00:24:49,252 --> 00:24:51,788
for you to choose
what your future is.

531
00:24:51,822 --> 00:24:53,022
And it's not just gonna be

532
00:24:53,056 --> 00:24:54,590
people around this school
talking

533
00:24:54,624 --> 00:24:56,625
and your friends talking.

534
00:24:56,659 --> 00:24:58,460
It's gonna be parents talking.

535
00:24:58,495 --> 00:25:01,463
It's gonna be college
admissions officers talking.

536
00:25:01,498 --> 00:25:04,867
So really think about
what you want, all right?

537
00:25:19,749 --> 00:25:22,084
- What's happening?
- Where'd you get the car?

538
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:24,086
Friend of mine.

539
00:25:24,121 --> 00:25:27,157
Gotta get it back
by midnight, you know.

540
00:25:27,191 --> 00:25:28,758
'Fore it turn into
a paddy wagon.

[Chuckling]

542
00:25:30,361 --> 00:25:32,929
I must have
just missed you earlier.

543
00:25:32,963 --> 00:25:34,197
You know, I went down

544
00:25:34,231 --> 00:25:36,299
to get some tickets
for your game on Friday.

545
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:38,334
- You went to my school?
- Yeah, man.

546
00:25:38,369 --> 00:25:40,670
Don't be going down there
lookin' for me.

547
00:25:40,704 --> 00:25:42,105
Hey, hey, come on, now.

548
00:25:42,139 --> 00:25:44,307
Your mama said you were
like superman out there.

549
00:25:44,341 --> 00:25:47,944
I want to see you play, son.

550
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:50,080
I'll be a'ight.

551
00:25:50,114 --> 00:25:52,182
Hey, hey, come on.
Hop in, hop in.

552
00:25:52,216 --> 00:25:53,816
We'll go get your mama at work,

553
00:25:53,851 --> 00:25:57,253
we'll get something to eat,
some ray's barbecue.

554
00:25:57,287 --> 00:25:59,722
Come on, man.

555
00:25:59,757 --> 00:26:02,291
Y'all go ahead and enjoy that.

556
00:26:02,326 --> 00:26:04,027
Come on, son.
You gotta eat, right?

557
00:26:04,061 --> 00:26:06,529
I'll be a'ight.

558
00:26:06,563 --> 00:26:08,765
You know,
I'm in this position where

559
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,767
everyone thinks
that I'm married,

560
00:26:10,801 --> 00:26:13,369
but I don't feel like I am.

561
00:26:13,404 --> 00:26:15,705
Is that why you don't
wear a wedding ring?

562
00:26:17,841 --> 00:26:19,175
I'm sorry.
You know what?

563
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,944
This is none of my business.

564
00:26:20,978 --> 00:26:23,947
- This is none of my business.
- No, you know what, it's okay.

565
00:26:23,981 --> 00:26:26,516
It's kind of liberating
to talk about it,

566
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:29,152
to hear it out loud.

567
00:26:29,186 --> 00:26:30,854
You know what,
we have some issues.

568
00:26:30,888 --> 00:26:33,223
Everyone in my life thinks
that we're happily married

569
00:26:33,257 --> 00:26:34,658
and that everything's great,

570
00:26:34,692 --> 00:26:37,260
but she's been gone
for six months on sabbatical,

571
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:39,329
and how are we supposed
to work on our issues

572
00:26:39,363 --> 00:26:42,132
if we're not even together?

573
00:26:42,166 --> 00:26:43,933
I probably shouldn't
have said any of that.

574
00:26:43,968 --> 00:26:46,002
I've had too much to drink.

575
00:26:46,036 --> 00:26:47,270
It's okay.

576
00:26:47,304 --> 00:26:51,674
I promise that
I will not tell a soul.

577
00:26:53,977 --> 00:26:56,179
You're an awesome girl,
Julie Taylor.

578
00:26:56,213 --> 00:27:01,083
In a different world,
different time...

579
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,687
Suffice it to say,

580
00:27:04,721 --> 00:27:06,888
I feel very comfortable
around you.

581
00:27:06,923 --> 00:27:09,591
I hope it's okay
that I said that.

582
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,828
Yeah, it's...
It's flattering.

583
00:27:13,862 --> 00:27:16,496
[Laughs]

584
00:27:16,531 --> 00:27:17,965
Good.

585
00:27:23,137 --> 00:27:25,039
Okay.

586
00:27:25,073 --> 00:27:27,542
Good night

587
00:27:27,576 --> 00:27:29,911
to you.

588
00:27:31,915 --> 00:27:33,916
Good night.

589
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:35,251
I'm gonna try that again

590
00:27:35,285 --> 00:27:37,120
and see if I can get
my legs to work.

It's been a lovely evening.

593
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:47,065
You know what you said about...

594
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:49,100
Taking chances?

595
00:27:49,135 --> 00:27:50,835
Yeah.

596
00:29:04,143 --> 00:29:07,145
The short part of your tie's
a little long, man.

597
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:10,815
You learn about ties
in the joint?

598
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:13,786
Uh-huh. You must have
took a tie class.

599
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:16,755
That's where your ass been
the last few years. Ha.

600
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:18,557
Don't worry about
where I learned it.

601
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:19,858
I learned it.

602
00:29:19,893 --> 00:29:21,826
- I don't care.
- That's enough, Vince.

603
00:29:21,861 --> 00:29:23,495
No, no, no.

604
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:26,330
It's okay.

605
00:29:26,365 --> 00:29:27,665
Come on.

606
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,367
Say what you need to say.

607
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:31,302
You don't get it, do you?

608
00:29:31,337 --> 00:29:33,404
We been doing just fine
without you.

609
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:35,073
And you come in here
and you expect us

610
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:37,709
to act like everything's cool,
but it's not.

611
00:29:37,743 --> 00:29:39,244
You ain't been here for us.

612
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:40,845
And if I had anything
to say about it,

613
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,647
your ass wouldn't even
be in this house.

614
00:29:42,681 --> 00:29:44,582
Hold up.
You gonna drop bombs?

615
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,417
- Oh!
- I got this.

616
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,487
You gonna drop bombs
and run like a little kid?

617
00:29:49,522 --> 00:29:53,025
Your house?

618
00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:55,794
You want to talk like a man,
we can do that.

619
00:29:58,031 --> 00:30:02,168
A man don't leave his family.

620
00:30:02,202 --> 00:30:06,106
Is that talkin' like a man?

621
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,008
And don't come
to my game tonight.

622
00:30:18,921 --> 00:30:21,423
Vince, wait.

623
00:30:21,458 --> 00:30:23,859
Vince, wait.

624
00:30:23,893 --> 00:30:25,694
Wait!

625
00:30:25,728 --> 00:30:27,863
Give him a chance.

626
00:30:27,897 --> 00:30:29,597
Okay, we give it a chance.
Then what?

627
00:30:29,631 --> 00:30:31,565
He starts robbing.
He starts stealing.

628
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:33,067
He'll end up
right back in prison.

629
00:30:33,101 --> 00:30:36,236
Okay, then do it for me.

630
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:40,706
Give him a chance for me.

631
00:30:40,741 --> 00:30:41,841
Okay?

632
00:30:43,844 --> 00:30:45,612
Let's be a family.

- For what?
- I don't know.

Didn't say.

early. Why?

Why not?

649
00:31:56,218 --> 00:31:58,719
Go ahead, say it.
Say what's on your mind.

650
00:31:58,754 --> 00:31:59,987
Well, first of all,
you didn't ask me

651
00:32:00,021 --> 00:32:02,123
how I felt
about Jess bein' on the team.

652
00:32:02,157 --> 00:32:03,357
Being in the locker room.

653
00:32:03,391 --> 00:32:04,959
I don't run personnel
decisions by you.

And all these new rules.
They're stupid.

and whatever high standards

you're lookin' for,
this ain't it.

657
00:32:10,567 --> 00:32:12,568
Close that door.

658
00:32:12,603 --> 00:32:13,936
Close that door.

659
00:32:26,551 --> 00:32:29,353
When I first met you,

660
00:32:29,388 --> 00:32:32,390
you were climbing out of
a police car.

661
00:32:32,424 --> 00:32:34,792
People said you were a punk

662
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,360
and you'd never last
on the field.

663
00:32:36,395 --> 00:32:38,096
You know
they still believe that?

664
00:32:38,131 --> 00:32:39,364
Screw them.

It's about character.

671
00:32:57,581 --> 00:33:01,950
It's about striving to be better
than everybody else.

672
00:33:06,989 --> 00:33:10,525
Coach, my dad
just got out of prison.

673

He's staying with me
at my house.

674

And I can't stand him.

675
00:33:16,499 --> 00:33:20,168
My mom,
she asked me to forgive him.

676
00:33:20,203 --> 00:33:22,338
To be better.

677
00:33:22,372 --> 00:33:26,075
And you're asking me
to be better.

678
00:33:26,109 --> 00:33:29,479
I don't know how to be better
'cause he never taught me how!

how to be better!

- He's not around!
- Hey, coach, we're going out.

681

- Ten minutes.
- Fine, coach.

682
00:33:36,155 --> 00:33:38,824
- I'm supposed to be better!
- Close that door.

Listen to me.

684
00:33:45,131 --> 00:33:48,600
I've said you need to strive

685
00:33:48,635 --> 00:33:51,736
to be better
than everyone else.

686
00:33:51,771 --> 00:33:54,406
I didn't say
you needed to be better

687
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,208
than everyone else.

688
00:33:57,242 --> 00:33:59,443
But you gotta try.

689
00:33:59,477 --> 00:34:02,312
And that's what character is.

690
00:34:02,346 --> 00:34:05,616

695
00:34:36,684 --> 00:34:38,586
Let's do this, a'ight?
On one. Ready?

696
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,154
All: Break.

697
00:34:40,188 --> 00:34:42,956
Late in the fourth quarter,
the Lions down by a touchdown.

698
00:34:42,991 --> 00:34:45,459
But they are still
in this game, folks.

699
00:34:45,493 --> 00:34:48,195
Howard to the line, looking
to get something started.

700
00:34:51,632 --> 00:34:54,167
Vince Howard
is taking no prisoners

701
00:34:54,201 --> 00:34:57,036
and finding Hastings
for another Lions first down.

702
00:34:58,872 --> 00:35:00,940
- Hike!
- Howard takes the snap.

703
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:02,374
Looking for a receiver.

704
00:35:02,409 --> 00:35:04,577
Oh, he's gonna
keep it on a scramble.

705
00:35:04,611 --> 00:35:06,345
- Take him out!
- Right there!

706
00:35:06,379 --> 00:35:09,448
Breaks the tackle.

707
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:12,284
Gain of 12, and the Lions
are knockin' on the door.

708
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:14,052
Howard drops.

709
00:35:14,086 --> 00:35:15,820
He throws.
He's got Russell.

710
00:35:15,854 --> 00:35:18,823
Touchdown!
An unbelievable pass!

711
00:35:18,857 --> 00:35:21,993
It's the Vince Howard show,
ladies and gentlemen.

712
00:35:22,027 --> 00:35:23,227
With a minute and a half to go,

713
00:35:23,262 --> 00:35:24,696
the Lions
have tied this ball game.

714
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:26,331
Defense!

715
00:35:26,366 --> 00:35:28,299
Defense!

716
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:32,038
[Chanting]
Defense! Defense!

717
00:35:32,072 --> 00:35:34,741
Comin' down to it, folks.
Dillon needs a stop.

718
00:35:34,775 --> 00:35:37,944
There's the snap.
Dragons are back.

719
00:35:37,979 --> 00:35:40,380
Cafferty's got a lane.
Big lick... boom!

720
00:35:40,415 --> 00:35:42,916
Ball is out.
Fumble!

721
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,284
Yeah!

722
00:35:44,318 --> 00:35:45,619
The ball is loose.
I don't know who's on it.

723
00:35:45,653 --> 00:35:47,721
Looks like Tinker fell on it.

724
00:35:47,755 --> 00:35:50,323
[Blows whistle]

725
00:35:50,358 --> 00:35:54,660
It's official, folks.
Lion's ball!

726
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:57,496
Under a minute to go, folks,
and there is life!

727
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,765
There is life in East Dillon.

728
00:36:02,268 --> 00:36:04,302
Okay, watch him, watch him.
Let's go, guys.

729
00:36:10,143 --> 00:36:11,643
Ready!

730
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:16,047
Set!

731
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,885
Hut!

732
00:36:19,919 --> 00:36:22,420
Howard in the pocket.

733
00:36:22,454 --> 00:36:25,122
He's got 88, Ruckle,
open over the middle.

734
00:36:25,157 --> 00:36:26,857
Complete.

735
00:36:26,891 --> 00:36:28,624
That is in bounds.
Time's still winding.

736
00:36:28,659 --> 00:36:31,860
The Lions are gonna
have to hurry.

737
00:36:31,895 --> 00:36:34,296
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.

738
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:36,431
Here we go, on the 20.
40 seconds left,

739
00:36:36,465 --> 00:36:38,198
and Vince Howard has been

740
00:36:38,233 --> 00:36:40,033
carrying this team
on his shoulders all night.

741
00:36:40,067 --> 00:36:42,468
He's got one last shot.

742
00:36:42,503 --> 00:36:43,969
Let's go!
Pick it up!

743
00:36:44,004 --> 00:36:46,572
Ready. Set.

744
00:36:46,606 --> 00:36:47,573
Hut!

745
00:36:47,608 --> 00:36:50,176
Pick it up!

746
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:04,424
Touchdown, Lions!

747
00:37:04,458 --> 00:37:06,659
Lions win!

748
00:37:06,693 --> 00:37:09,128
Vince "get the hell
outta my way" Howard

749
00:37:09,162 --> 00:37:10,763
has lit up this field tonight.

750
00:37:10,797 --> 00:37:13,066
What a show by this young man.

751
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:16,002
The Lions are 3 and 0.
What do you know?

752
00:37:16,036 --> 00:37:19,439
They call that
the Tinker shuffle.

753
00:37:19,473 --> 00:37:21,741
Gets 'em a flag
for excessive celebration,

754
00:37:21,776 --> 00:37:23,410
but you can't really
blame these kids.

755
00:37:23,444 --> 00:37:25,679
Another big night.

756
00:37:25,713 --> 00:37:28,982
Another big win
for these East Dillon Lions.

757
00:37:29,016 --> 00:37:30,984
Hey.

758
00:37:31,018 --> 00:37:33,119
That was a hell of an effort.

759
00:37:33,154 --> 00:37:34,854
Hell of an effort.

760
00:37:34,888 --> 00:37:36,456
I ain't got nothing left,
coach.

761
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:37,557
That's character, Vince.

762
00:37:43,664 --> 00:37:45,465
3 and 0!
3 and 0, man!

763
00:37:45,499 --> 00:37:47,034
3 and 0!

764
00:37:47,068 --> 00:37:49,269
We got it!
Let's go!

765
00:37:49,303 --> 00:37:52,072
[Cheering]

766
00:37:52,106 --> 00:37:53,507
East side, baby!

767
00:37:53,541 --> 00:37:55,876
East side!

768
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:58,045
Give it up.
Give it up.

769
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:01,381
You see it?
There it is.

770
00:38:02,683 --> 00:38:05,352
[All chanting]
3 and 0, East side!

771
00:38:05,386 --> 00:38:07,154
3 and 0, East side!

772
00:38:07,188 --> 00:38:10,224
3 and 0, East side!

773
00:38:10,258 --> 00:38:12,826
3 and 0, East side.

774
00:38:12,861 --> 00:38:15,195
3 and 0, East side.

775
00:38:15,229 --> 00:38:18,031
3 and 0, East side.

776
00:38:18,065 --> 00:38:21,435
[Telephone rings]

777
00:38:26,241 --> 00:38:28,775
- Hello?
- Pam.

778
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:30,243
Yeah.

779
00:38:30,278 --> 00:38:33,513
This is what I've decided.

780
00:38:33,548 --> 00:38:35,515
Send Buddy junior
home to Dillon.

781
00:38:35,549 --> 00:38:38,185
He needs his father.

782
00:38:38,219 --> 00:38:39,887
Are you sure?

783
00:38:39,921 --> 00:38:43,724
I've never been more sure
of anything in my life.

784
00:38:43,759 --> 00:38:47,228
Send my son home, Pam.

785
00:38:47,262 --> 00:38:50,197
Thank you.

786
00:38:58,541 --> 00:39:00,542
Hey.

787
00:39:00,576 --> 00:39:02,444
Hey.

788
00:39:02,479 --> 00:39:03,779
You okay?

789
00:39:03,814 --> 00:39:07,050
Yeah. Feelin' good.

790
00:39:07,084 --> 00:39:10,487
I'm really sorry.

791
00:39:10,521 --> 00:39:11,922
There's nothing
to be sorry about.

792
00:39:11,956 --> 00:39:13,290
No, no, there is.

793
00:39:13,324 --> 00:39:15,559
I mean, I shouldn't
have let that happen.

794
00:39:15,594 --> 00:39:17,695
I'm a teacher.
You're a student.

795
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,631
It wasn't a good idea.

796
00:39:19,665 --> 00:39:23,535
Right. No, I-I-I
totally agree with you.

797
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:27,171
So we're good then.

798
00:39:27,206 --> 00:39:28,839
Yeah.

799
00:39:28,874 --> 00:39:30,740
Okay.

800
00:39:30,775 --> 00:39:33,877
See you in class.

801
00:39:54,033 --> 00:39:56,634
I went to your game.

802
00:39:56,669 --> 00:40:00,438
I know you didn't want me to.

803
00:40:00,472 --> 00:40:02,574
But I did.

804
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:06,711
Look here.

805
00:40:06,746 --> 00:40:09,915
I-I want you to know, um...

806
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:16,856
I know how much
of your life I missed.

807
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:19,225
I really...

808
00:40:19,259 --> 00:40:21,761
I did some bad stuff.

809
00:40:21,795 --> 00:40:24,531
And I was gone.

810
00:40:27,101 --> 00:40:29,837
Time I'll never get back.

811
00:40:33,176 --> 00:40:35,778
Look at you.

812
00:40:35,812 --> 00:40:39,949
You only 17 years old.

813
00:40:39,984 --> 00:40:43,186
And you already better
than I ever was.

814
00:40:46,623 --> 00:40:48,458
And you were right.

815
00:40:50,594 --> 00:40:52,061
It's your house now.

816
00:40:52,095 --> 00:40:54,663
And you the man here.

817
00:40:54,698 --> 00:40:57,933
I didn't ask
if I could stay here.

818
00:40:57,967 --> 00:41:02,470
That was wrong.
Sorry.

819
00:41:08,343 --> 00:41:11,579
[Chuckles] Tonight...

820
00:41:13,349 --> 00:41:17,652
For the first time
in my life...

821
00:41:17,686 --> 00:41:20,721
I knew what pride felt like.

822
00:41:23,391 --> 00:41:26,327
Ha. I mean, boy, you...

823
00:41:26,362 --> 00:41:29,096
That was crazy out there.
[Laughs]

824
00:41:29,131 --> 00:41:31,999
You... you the man for real.

825
00:41:32,034 --> 00:41:35,904
Leaping over players
in a single bound, boy.

826

[Chuckling]

827
00:41:53,955 --> 00:41:57,157
I'm proud of you, Vincent.

[Door opens and closes]

829
00:42:16,644 --> 00:42:20,580
Hey, so, uh,
so where you gonna be?

830
00:42:20,615 --> 00:42:23,384
I'll be around.
