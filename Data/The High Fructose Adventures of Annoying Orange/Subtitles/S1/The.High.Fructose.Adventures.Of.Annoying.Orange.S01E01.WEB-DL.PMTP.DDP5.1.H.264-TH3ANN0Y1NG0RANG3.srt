173
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,081
-Yeah!

174
00:06:59,081 --> 00:07:00,734
-[firing]

175
00:07:00,734 --> 00:07:02,074
-(marshmallows)
Yay!

176
00:07:02,074 --> 00:07:02,942
[stomp!]

177
00:07:02,942 --> 00:07:05,609
-[chuckles evilly]
-Guys, we should help!

178
00:07:05,609 --> 00:07:06,999
Set blasters to "candy."

179
00:07:06,999 --> 00:07:09,212
-Yeah, let's light up
that dream killer!

180
00:07:09,212 --> 00:07:12,046
-Captain, we can't. We're on a
peaceful mission, remember?

181
00:07:12,046 --> 00:07:14,276
-She's right. Intergalactic law
doesn't allow us

182
00:07:14,276 --> 00:07:16,083
to interfere
with regional conflicts.

183
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:17,595
-Dang it! Oh, well.

184
00:07:17,595 --> 00:07:19,468
I guess we'll just sit back
and enjoy the show.

185
00:07:19,468 --> 00:07:22,022
[marshmallows cheering,
unicorn whinnies]

186
00:07:22,028 --> 00:07:24,726
-(burning marshmallow)
It tickles! [laughs]

187
00:07:24,726 --> 00:07:26,527
-Father, we're taking
heavy casualties.

188
00:07:26,527 --> 00:07:28,901
Shall we send in reinforcements?
Yay!

189
00:07:28,901 --> 00:07:32,272
-There aren't any, Winky. Things
have changes since you left.

190
00:07:32,272 --> 00:07:35,060
The Candy Monster has destroyed
most of our villages,

191
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,518
townships, suburbs, and even
that sad little trailer park

192
00:07:38,518 --> 00:07:39,985
out by Caramel Lake.

193
00:07:39,985 --> 00:07:41,686
[banjo plays]

194
00:07:41,686 --> 00:07:43,438
We can't hold him off
much longer.

195
00:07:43,438 --> 00:07:46,443
Soon all of Marshmalia
will be gone, I fear.

196
00:07:46,443 --> 00:07:50,523
But we're going to party until
the end 'cause that's how we do.

197
00:07:50,523 --> 00:07:54,246
-It's how we do!
-It's how we do!

198
00:07:54,246 --> 00:07:58,776
-DJ Princess Buttercup, kick out
the end-of-the-world jams!

199
00:07:58,776 --> 00:08:02,963
-Don't mind if I do!
-[laughs sinisterly]

200
00:08:02,963 --> 00:08:05,938
Soon I shall destroy
the last of you,

201
00:08:05,938 --> 00:08:10,106
and then rock candy will become
the main ingredient in s'mores

202
00:08:10,106 --> 00:08:12,225
and other
marshmallow-based desserts,

203
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,277
like marshmallow cookie pies

204
00:08:14,277 --> 00:08:16,655
and... some other things.

205
00:08:16,655 --> 00:08:18,941
-[singsong]: Thanks for
laying out your entire plan!

206
00:08:18,941 --> 00:08:23,691
-I said that out loud? Shoot!
It's a terrible affectation.

207
00:08:23,691 --> 00:08:25,159
-Maybe we can help you guys.

208
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:28,291
-We can't.
Intergalactic law says...

209
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,107
-Apple,
you're past your sell-by date.

210
00:08:30,107 --> 00:08:32,441
Pear, Passion,
check the intergalactic bylaws

211
00:08:32,441 --> 00:08:33,376
for a workaround.

212
00:08:33,376 --> 00:08:35,693
-The only way we can
interfere in regional affairs

213
00:08:35,693 --> 00:08:37,788
is if one of crew
was harmed in the conflict.

214
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:39,297
[boom!]
-(Apple) Ow!

215
00:08:39,297 --> 00:08:41,025
-(Orange)
Well, that's good enough for me.

216
00:08:41,025 --> 00:08:43,883
Now fire!
[blasters whirring]

217
00:08:43,884 --> 00:08:45,194
-[chuckles]

218
00:08:45,194 --> 00:08:46,689
-Captain, our weapons are useless.

219
00:08:46,689 --> 00:08:49,517
They're bouncin' off his skin.
It's like a reflective surface.

220
00:08:49,517 --> 00:08:54,359
-[laughs evilly] Your pathetic
laser weapons can't defeat me,

221
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:57,609
unless they can heat my body
to a consistent temperature

222
00:08:57,609 --> 00:09:00,901
and boil me down to liquid
sugar, which they can't.

223
00:09:00,901 --> 00:09:05,568
[grumbles]
Oh, said it out loud again!

224
00:09:05,568 --> 00:09:07,324
-Guys, I've got a crazy plan.

225
00:09:07,324 --> 00:09:09,527
Marshmallow, what's
the boiling point of caramel?

226
00:09:09,527 --> 00:09:12,838
-Really hot.
-Midget Apple, can you swim?

227
00:09:12,838 --> 00:09:14,831
-LITTLE Apple can bob.

228
00:09:14,831 --> 00:09:16,859
-[chuckles]

229
00:09:16,859 --> 00:09:20,723
-Okay, Bob, get swimmin'.
[laughs]

[Nerville grunts,

231
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:27,838
-Hey, Candy Man!
Here's a little peace offering!

232
00:09:27,838 --> 00:09:29,219
Come and get it!

233
00:09:29,219 --> 00:09:30,727
-[grunting]
-(Midget Apple) Whoa!

234

[Nerville grunts,

237
00:09:34,819 --> 00:09:36,439
-What the? I'm stuck.

238
00:09:36,439 --> 00:09:38,279
Did I say that out loud?

239
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,274
-Yeah. You kinda did.

240
00:09:40,274 --> 00:09:42,324
[lasers whirring]

241
00:09:43,754 --> 00:09:48,686
-Boiling caramel? Oh, that will
melt me to a sugary morass!

242
00:09:48,686 --> 00:09:53,134
Gah! There I go!
Giving away my secrets again.

Hey, Big Rock Candy Monster!

All hail Orange! We're saved!

-I can't thank you fruits enough
for saving our world

249
00:10:09,438 --> 00:10:12,898
from that horrible monster.
-No problem, Your Kingship.

250
00:10:12,898 --> 00:10:15,890
Glad to help "sweeten"
things up. [laughs]

-So long, Father!

See you next time we happen
to crash-land here! Yay!
