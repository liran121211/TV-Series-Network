1
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,880
How much further, Loesch?

2
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,120
Straight on.

3
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,120
- Pull over, Private.
- Stop.

4
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,840
Grab those shovels.

5
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,400
Show us, Loesch.

6
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,120
Spread out.

7
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,440
Here.

8
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,400
Start digging.

9
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,960
We got something.

10
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,040
Here it is.

11
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,560
What's he asking for?

12
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,640
Freedom in a country of his choice.

13
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,480
And a generous pension
to last the rest of his lifetime.

14
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,360
Well, let's see how good it is first.

15
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,720
Get it translated.

16
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,520
- Don't you knock?
- Sir.

17
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,960
Uh, gentlemen, may I help you?

18
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,280
Enter.

19
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,680
Sir.

20
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm going to need to speak
to the Prime Minister.

21
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,320
I need to see the King.

22
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,840
We all suspected it.

23
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,200
These papers must never see
the light of day, Winston. Ever.

24
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,720
Publication could do grave harm
to the national interest.

25
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,280
The gravest.

26
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:35,200
What is written here brings
the greatest shame upon this family.

27
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,600
Our people would, rightfully,
never forgive us.

36
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,280
<i>And when you turn...</i>

37
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,760
It's rare and not entirely reassuring
to see religious certainty

38
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,800
in someone so young.

39
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:35,240
- He's not young; he's my age.
- Precisely. A child.

40
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,640
I think moral authority
and spiritual guidance

41
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,160
should come from someone
with a little life experience.

42
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,360
Not from someone
who learned their trade selling brushes

43
00:08:44,385 --> 00:08:45,905
door to door in North Carolina.

44
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,320
But there's a humility to that
which I like.

45
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,800
Are those people crying?

46
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,360
<i> Billy Graham has spoken to</i>

47
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,964
<i>more than one and a half

- What's happening to this country?
<i>- Now, he sums up his crusade.</i>

49
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:58,110
The people of Great Britain
never cried during the war.

50
00:08:58,245 --> 00:09:00,405
Now they're weeping like children.

51
00:09:00,485 --> 00:09:03,820
<i> I'm calling for a revival</i>
<i>that will cause every man and woman</i>

52
00:09:03,845 --> 00:09:06,020
<i>to return to their offices and shops</i>

53
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:09,965
<i>and live out the teachings of Christ

00:09:10,045 --> 00:09:13,925
<i>I'm going to preach a gospel,
not of despair, but of hope.</i>

55
00:09:14,005 --> 00:09:19,045
<i>Hope for the individual,
hope for society, hope for the world.</i>

56
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,525
Turning out in droves
for an American zealot.

57
00:09:22,325 --> 00:09:23,485
He's not a zealot.

58
00:09:24,045 --> 00:09:25,925
He's shouting, darling.
Only zealots shout.

59
00:09:26,005 --> 00:09:27,845
<i>When you close your eyes,</i>

00:09:27,925 --> 00:09:30,405
<i>close your ears to God's way,</i>

61

<i>you will soon prefer your own ideas
to the ideas of God.</i>

62
00:09:35,565 --> 00:09:40,125
<i>You come to a stage where your own evil
seems to you good</i>

63
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:45,885
<i>and God's good seems to be evil.</i>

64
00:10:03,165 --> 00:10:04,165
- On three.

65
00:10:04,245 --> 00:10:06,245
Happy birthday, Trooper!

66
00:10:06,805 --> 00:10:07,805
Good boy.

67
00:10:11,045 --> 00:10:13,445
Good shot! Bravo.

68
00:10:14,965 --> 00:10:16,645
Well done.

69
00:10:27,925 --> 00:10:30,045
Now we are losing.

70
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,685
- Is it me?
- It's me, it's me!

71
00:10:32,525 --> 00:10:33,765
No, I don't want one.

72
00:10:33,845 --> 00:10:36,565
Oh, darling. Where's your pep?

73
00:10:48,605 --> 00:10:49,885
You look very dashing.

74
00:10:52,445 --> 00:10:53,645
A hat!

75
00:10:54,565 --> 00:10:56,645
<i>- Monsieur.
- Alors, qu'est-ce que vous pensez?</i>

76
00:10:56,725 --> 00:11:00,525
<i>- Magnifique! Parfait!</i>
- I don't like it.

77
00:11:17,365 --> 00:11:19,645
Oh, no, no, no, I cannot go like this.

78
00:11:19,765 --> 00:11:20,845
Why not?

79
00:11:21,285 --> 00:11:24,605
At least that way,
I get to be queen once.

80
00:12:24,245 --> 00:12:27,205
Would you like to know what my day
consisted of today?

81
00:12:28,325 --> 00:12:31,245
Don't tell me.
The same as every other day.

82
00:12:31,325 --> 00:12:35,325
I rose late. Past 11.
Then inspected the gardens.

83
00:12:35,405 --> 00:12:37,365
Then ate lunch with people
of no consequence.

84
00:12:37,445 --> 00:12:40,405
- My friends!
- People of no consequence.

85
00:12:41,445 --> 00:12:43,725
I never thought I'd hear myself say it,

86
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:46,645
but a life of pleasure
really has its limits.

87
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:48,765
Try a life spent living with you.

88
00:12:53,645 --> 00:12:59,645
My motto, as Prince of Wales,
was<i> "Ich dien."</i> "I serve."

89
00:13:01,285 --> 00:13:05,765
Deeply rooted within me
is a need to serve my country.

90
00:13:05,845 --> 00:13:09,005
I need a job, a purpose.

91
00:13:09,085 --> 00:13:10,605
- Not this again.
- Yes, this.

92
00:13:10,685 --> 00:13:13,045
Well, where do you intend to find one?

93
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:18,285
I will simply have to go to London
to set things in motion.

94
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:21,231
Shall I tell you what else is deeply
rooted within your family?

95
00:13:21,231 --> 00:13:22,251
Delusion.

96
00:13:22,525 --> 00:13:24,885
They won't let you in the country,
let alone give you a job.

97
00:13:24,965 --> 00:13:27,325
- That's not what my lawyer says.
- You've spoken to George?

98
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,085
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Well, I'm telling you now.

99
00:13:31,165 --> 00:13:34,405
I still have allies, you know,
important allies.

100
00:13:34,845 --> 00:13:37,565
Disciples of the truth,
advocates of justice,

101
00:13:37,645 --> 00:13:40,965
who could mobilize opinion,

102
00:13:41,045 --> 00:13:47,205
start a campaign... to have
a former king be forgiven.

103
00:13:58,365 --> 00:14:01,085
Finally, there's a request, ma'am,
from the government,

104
00:14:01,165 --> 00:14:03,845
for you to open the new airport
at Gatwick.

105
00:14:03,925 --> 00:14:05,798
Um, they've offered some dates.

106
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,749
Third of June works best for us, I think.

107
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:11,285
- Yes, all right.
- And that is it from me.

108
00:14:11,365 --> 00:14:12,805
Thank you, Michael.

109
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,845
- Oh, there was something.
- There was...

110
00:14:17,805 --> 00:14:18,805
Ma'am.

111
00:14:19,403 --> 00:14:22,231
If I wished to meet Reverend Graham,

112
00:14:22,256 --> 00:14:23,909
do you think that could be arranged?

113
00:14:26,205 --> 00:14:27,285
The evangelist, ma'am?

114
00:14:28,645 --> 00:14:29,845
Yes.

115
00:14:31,765 --> 00:14:35,605
Well, I should need
to give it some thought.

116
00:14:35,685 --> 00:14:36,685
Um...

117
00:14:37,405 --> 00:14:40,925
One might imagine
an invitation being extended

118
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:45,478
to preach at All Saints'
Chapel at Windsor

119
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,749
and a private lunch to follow?

120
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,285
Lovely.

121
00:14:49,965 --> 00:14:52,685
We should have to be careful,
though, ma'am,

122
00:14:52,765 --> 00:14:56,845
that any invitation to,
or association with, Reverend Graham,

123
00:14:56,925 --> 00:15:00,085
not be perceived as an endorsement
of his...

124
00:15:02,405 --> 00:15:03,685
crusades,

125
00:15:03,765 --> 00:15:05,358
which would not be compatible

126
00:15:05,383 --> 00:15:06,949
with your role as the head of the Church.

127
00:15:07,005 --> 00:15:09,125
I'm sure you'll handle it all perfectly,
Michael.

128
00:15:09,205 --> 00:15:10,765
And you had something?

129
00:15:11,445 --> 00:15:13,245
Yes, um...

130
00:15:13,845 --> 00:15:17,885
His Royal Highness, the Duke of Windsor,
has written with a request.

131
00:15:17,965 --> 00:15:20,125
- Oh.
- What for?

132
00:15:20,845 --> 00:15:23,805
- To be allowed to enter the country.
- Denied!

133
00:15:23,885 --> 00:15:26,485
To research a book
which he's planning to write.

134
00:15:26,565 --> 00:15:27,405
On what subject?

135
00:15:27,485 --> 00:15:31,005
<i>a Guidebook.</i>

136
00:15:31,085 --> 00:15:33,085
Mm.

137
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:34,805
He didn't say.

138
00:15:34,885 --> 00:15:37,085
I suppose we could let him stay
at Kensington Palace.

139
00:15:37,165 --> 00:15:39,565
He's intending to stay
with his friend Major Metcalfe.

140
00:15:39,645 --> 00:15:42,365
Fruity? But doesn't he live in Surrey?

141
00:15:42,445 --> 00:15:44,725
- Sussex, I believe.
- Oh, that's quite good.

142
00:15:44,805 --> 00:15:47,725
- Out of public eye.
- The further the better, if you ask me.

143
00:15:49,765 --> 00:15:51,325
So, that is a yes.

144
00:15:51,405 --> 00:15:52,365
- No!
- Yes.

145
00:15:52,925 --> 00:15:54,885
- No.
- Yes.

146
00:15:56,925 --> 00:15:58,445
Yes, let him come.

147
00:15:59,165 --> 00:16:00,165
Ma'am.

148
00:16:15,365 --> 00:16:17,285
- Morning.
- Good morning, sir.

149
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,598
Uh, did you finish that paperwork?

150
00:16:20,623 --> 00:16:21,508
Yes, sir.

151
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,245
- Thank you.
- This one's for Mr. Sweet.

152
00:16:23,325 --> 00:16:25,405
- This one for...
- Morning, Margaret.

153
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:28,325
Morning, sir. Monsieur Robert.

154
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:29,525
Yes, ma'am.

155
00:16:50,205 --> 00:16:51,605
Take a look at this.

156
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:55,445
It's practically an injunction.

157
00:16:55,725 --> 00:16:56,805
Sir.

158
00:16:59,205 --> 00:17:00,605
Are you aware of this?

159
00:17:05,485 --> 00:17:06,325
I am.

160
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:11,645
As historians, we have a duty to publish
the truth, no exceptions.

161
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:16,205
Otherwise, what are we all doing?
Protecting Nazis?

162
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,085
Protecting something else.

163
00:17:19,685 --> 00:17:20,765
My hands are tied.

164
00:17:20,845 --> 00:17:22,165
But his are not.

165
00:17:22,245 --> 00:17:23,645
That's right.

166
00:17:23,725 --> 00:17:26,485
I have access to the US State Department
duplicate files.

167
00:17:26,565 --> 00:17:28,085
Including this.

168
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:31,605
There's nothing to stop
the American government publishing

169
00:17:31,685 --> 00:17:33,085
if the British government won't.

170
00:17:44,085 --> 00:17:46,325
<i> "My dearest darling Peaches,</i>

171
00:17:46,405 --> 00:17:50,365
<i>let us hope the rest of the trip
is not as miserable as the journey.</i>

172
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:54,365
<i>It was a most disagreeable crossing,
due to bad weather.</i>

173
00:17:54,445 --> 00:17:57,285
<i>The company on the boat was dreadful too,</i>

174
00:17:57,365 --> 00:17:59,485
<i>common and uninteresting people,</i>

175
00:17:59,565 --> 00:18:03,045
<i>pestering me to join them for drinks
or play cards.</i>

176
00:18:05,565 --> 00:18:08,805
<i>On arrival in London,
my mood was lifted slightly</i>

177
00:18:08,885 --> 00:18:13,205
<i>by a large group of welcoming supporters
who cheered my name</i>

178
00:18:13,285 --> 00:18:15,325
<i>and removed their hats.</i>

179
00:18:15,405 --> 00:18:19,565
<i>And my niece, the Queen,
sent me one of the hearses.</i>

180
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:28,205
<i>Later in the evening I feared things
would go from bad to worse,</i>

181
00:18:28,285 --> 00:18:31,471
<i>as we arrived at Fruity's rather
drab little house,</i>

182
00:18:31,496 --> 00:18:33,229
<i>somewhere in Sussex."</i>

183
00:18:37,605 --> 00:18:38,805
Fruity.

184
00:18:38,885 --> 00:18:40,605
- Your Royal Highness.
- How are you?

185
00:18:40,685 --> 00:18:42,605
- Very well.
- Your Royal Highness.

186
00:18:42,685 --> 00:18:43,685
Baba dear.

187
00:18:43,765 --> 00:18:46,285
<i> "But George excelled, as ever, </i>

188
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,589
<i>and revealed the work
he had already done."</i>

189
00:18:48,645 --> 00:18:51,565
Of course the true purpose
of the visit can't be known to anybody.

190
00:18:51,645 --> 00:18:55,125
Should anyone get wind of any
"job hunting" by His Royal Highness,

191
00:18:55,205 --> 00:18:56,666
it might be seen as a

192
00:18:56,691 --> 00:18:59,669
violation of the agreement
made after the abdication

193
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:01,605
and His Royal Highness might find himself

194
00:19:01,685 --> 00:19:05,845
not only being asked to leave
the country, but also without a pension.

195
00:19:06,765 --> 00:19:11,405
So, this trip must be perceived,
first and foremost, as a literary one.

196
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:15,125
- I trust you came prepared.
- I brought quill and ink.

197
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,565
All that notwithstanding,

198
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,205
I've started a campaign,

199
00:19:22,165 --> 00:19:24,085
gathering friends and supporters.

200
00:19:24,165 --> 00:19:26,125
And early indications
are most encouraging.

201
00:19:26,205 --> 00:19:28,725
Walter Monckton has agreed
to host a dinner,

202
00:19:28,805 --> 00:19:31,685
and we've had "yesses"
from Lord Salisbury, Lord Beaverbrook,

203
00:19:31,765 --> 00:19:34,385
Lord Dudley, the American ambassador

204
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:37,269
and the Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd.

205
00:19:37,325 --> 00:19:39,805
Ooh, Cecil Beaton and Noel Coward

206
00:19:39,885 --> 00:19:42,325
have agreed to hold
a little supper party for you.

207
00:19:42,405 --> 00:19:45,205
Oh, dear Cecil...

208
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:47,125
...and his inedible food.

209
00:20:11,645 --> 00:20:16,325
- Do we really have to do this?
- Indulge me. I'm interested.

210
00:20:18,165 --> 00:20:21,405
Couldn't you just make up an excuse
and say I'm off sinning somewhere?

211
00:20:21,485 --> 00:20:22,485
No.

212
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,925
Lanky bugger, isn't he?

213
00:20:29,005 --> 00:20:30,645
I think he's rather handsome.

214
00:20:30,725 --> 00:20:34,005
A door-to-door salesman
in a hideous shiny suit.

215
00:20:34,885 --> 00:20:36,525
- Where's his box?
- What box?

216
00:20:36,605 --> 00:20:39,565
- The one containing his brushes.
- Oh, no, look.

217
00:20:39,645 --> 00:20:42,845
- Come on. We'll be late.
- Hair brushes. Floor brushes.

218
00:20:42,925 --> 00:20:45,645
- Toothbrushes.
- Do shut up, Philip.

219
00:20:45,725 --> 00:20:48,725
As I was thinking about
what to preach about today,

220
00:20:48,805 --> 00:20:52,125
I considered various topics
which speak to me personally,

221
00:20:52,205 --> 00:20:55,565
but I thought that I would start
with a simple question.

222
00:20:57,525 --> 00:20:59,365
What is a Christian?

223
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:03,125
The Bible tells us; Colossians 1:27 says

224
00:21:03,205 --> 00:21:09,045
that a Christian
is a person in whom Christ dwells.

225
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,645
It's Christ in you.

226
00:21:10,725 --> 00:21:12,445
The hope of glory.

227
00:21:12,525 --> 00:21:15,565
It means that you have
a personal relationship

228
00:21:15,645 --> 00:21:17,525
with the Lord Jesus Christ.

229
00:21:17,605 --> 00:21:20,485
That encounter has taken place.

230
00:21:20,565 --> 00:21:23,765
You have received Christ as savior.

231
00:21:25,045 --> 00:21:28,685
And that is what a Christian is.

232
00:21:35,645 --> 00:21:37,405
I enjoyed that very much.

233
00:21:37,485 --> 00:21:41,085
You do speak with such wonderful clarity
and certainty.

234
00:21:41,165 --> 00:21:43,045
I find it very reassuring.

235
00:21:44,085 --> 00:21:45,565
And it's not only me.

236
00:21:46,205 --> 00:21:48,445
The rest of the country are too,
I imagine.

237
00:21:48,525 --> 00:21:49,845
Yes.

238
00:21:49,925 --> 00:21:52,005
We've been surprised ourselves
at the turnout.

239
00:21:52,085 --> 00:21:53,605
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

240
00:21:53,685 --> 00:21:55,525
Well, you shouldn't be.

241
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:57,498
In an increasingly complex world,

242
00:21:57,523 --> 00:22:00,309
we all need certainty,
and you provide it.

243
00:22:00,365 --> 00:22:03,405
Well, that's not me.
The scriptures provide it.

244
00:22:03,925 --> 00:22:09,205
Yes, but you illuminate them so well.

245
00:22:09,285 --> 00:22:12,318
The great joy that I have
felt today was that of being

246
00:22:12,343 --> 00:22:13,871
a simple congregant,

247
00:22:13,896 --> 00:22:16,565
being taught, being led.

248
00:22:16,645 --> 00:22:19,205
You see, as head of the Anglican Church,
in terms of rank,

249
00:22:19,285 --> 00:22:23,645
even the great Archbishops of York
and Canterbury are below me.

250
00:22:24,765 --> 00:22:26,805
Above me there is only God.

251
00:22:26,885 --> 00:22:30,445
- Well, that must be lonely sometimes.
- Yes, it is.

252
00:22:32,805 --> 00:22:36,155
Which is why it's lovely, as Queen,

253
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:39,469
to be able to just disappear and be...

254
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,005
A simple Christian.

255
00:22:43,565 --> 00:22:44,965
Yes.

256
00:22:46,645 --> 00:22:51,685
Above all things, I do think of myself
as just a simple Christian.

257
00:22:53,165 --> 00:22:57,645
It's the values of Christian living
that root me, guide me.

258
00:22:58,925 --> 00:23:00,085
Define me.

259
00:23:05,365 --> 00:23:07,165
Have you always been such a good speaker?

260
00:23:07,885 --> 00:23:09,445
I was actually a shy child.

261
00:23:09,525 --> 00:23:11,325
- No.
- Mm-hm.

262
00:23:12,245 --> 00:23:13,885
Speaking as a shy child myself,

263
00:23:13,965 --> 00:23:16,365
I have to say that I find that
very hard to believe.

264
00:23:16,445 --> 00:23:18,605
No, ma'am, it's true.

265
00:23:19,445 --> 00:23:24,925
The first time I ever spoke in public,
I was 12 years old. At school.

266
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:28,925
The school principal told my mother
he thought I was a natural,

267
00:23:29,485 --> 00:23:33,365
<i>that, of all things, I had a gift.</i>

268
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:33,165
<i> I've no objection to his being here.</i>

269
00:24:33,965 --> 00:24:35,785
It's the word "crusade"

270
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:37,229
that troubles me.

271
00:24:39,565 --> 00:24:41,911
If the Reverend Graham is the crusader,

272
00:24:41,936 --> 00:24:43,859
the implication is that we're heathens!

273
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:46,283
Not sure I go along with it.

274
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:48,965
Mr. Wheeler-Bennett, sir.

275
00:24:49,525 --> 00:24:51,405
Ah, excuse me.

276
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:57,325
Prime Minister. Thank you for seeing me.

277
00:24:57,405 --> 00:25:02,485
You didn't give me much choice.
"A matter of the greatest urgency."

278
00:25:02,565 --> 00:25:05,365
Your team of troublesome historians?

279
00:25:05,445 --> 00:25:08,565
Committed historians.
Principled historians.

280
00:25:10,565 --> 00:25:13,565
- Is that the file in question?
- Yes.

281
00:25:14,765 --> 00:25:15,765
Let's make a start.

282
00:25:20,965 --> 00:25:23,845
Ah, there you are! Plotters all!

283
00:25:23,925 --> 00:25:25,245
Your Royal Highness.

284
00:25:25,325 --> 00:25:26,565
Are the curtains drawn?

285
00:25:26,645 --> 00:25:28,605
Does treason abound?

286
00:25:28,685 --> 00:25:30,325
George, thank you so much.

287
00:25:30,405 --> 00:25:32,205
- Cecil, it's so good of you to come.
- Sir.

288
00:25:32,285 --> 00:25:34,685
- Dear Bobbety. How are you?
- Hello, sir. I'm very well.

289
00:25:34,765 --> 00:25:36,405
Walter, thank you so much for all this.

290
00:25:36,485 --> 00:25:39,405
<i> We all know why we're here tonight.</i>

291
00:25:39,485 --> 00:25:42,405
To see if we can help our dear friend,

292
00:25:42,485 --> 00:25:47,405
His Royal Highness,
in his quest to find...

293
00:25:48,245 --> 00:25:51,085
A final act to this sad drama.

294
00:25:51,165 --> 00:25:54,845
And to turn it into a great history play.
He seeks a job.

295
00:25:55,405 --> 00:25:57,285
A purpose.

296
00:25:57,365 --> 00:26:01,965
Well, that's why I'm here.
To ask you all, my council of war,

297
00:26:02,045 --> 00:26:07,725
my... my<i> Brains Trust</i> of politicians,
artists and philosophers.

298
00:26:07,805 --> 00:26:10,445
- Something in the military, perhaps?
- Well, why not?

299
00:26:10,911 --> 00:26:12,612
I was made a major-general,

300
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:15,057
attached to the British
military mission in France

301
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,805
at the beginning of the war,
in a liaising role

302
00:26:16,885 --> 00:26:19,205
between us and the French,
and I very much enjoyed it.

303
00:26:19,285 --> 00:26:21,285
Or a position within the Board of Trade.

304
00:26:22,245 --> 00:26:23,765
Well, what kind of position?

305
00:26:23,845 --> 00:26:26,325
Helping promote Britain's
economic interests abroad.

306
00:26:27,405 --> 00:26:31,365
- Well... Yes.
- The right man in the right position

307
00:26:31,445 --> 00:26:33,965
could contribute
so much to Britain's economy,

308
00:26:34,045 --> 00:26:36,805
helping boost our much-needed
dollar reserves.

309
00:26:36,885 --> 00:26:40,005
- A man with charm, contacts, influence.
- Hmm.

310
00:26:40,645 --> 00:26:43,565
And the magic of being a former King.

311
00:26:45,205 --> 00:26:47,965
Look, doesn't it all feel
a little grubby, Walter,

312
00:26:48,045 --> 00:26:50,485
all those grasping
international businessmen,

313
00:26:50,565 --> 00:26:52,845
the whiff of profit and self-interest?

314
00:26:52,925 --> 00:26:54,198
No, I like the

315
00:26:54,223 --> 00:26:57,269
direction we were heading earlier,
the idea of a liaison post.

316
00:26:57,325 --> 00:27:01,445
- Then what about the diplomatic service?
- Oh, I like that idea.

317
00:27:01,525 --> 00:27:06,965
Don't the Americans have these unofficial
roving ambassadors nowadays?

318
00:27:07,045 --> 00:27:10,445
Yes, they have two in London
at the moment. Hmm.

319
00:27:10,525 --> 00:27:12,365
Well, something like that would be ideal.

320
00:27:12,445 --> 00:27:14,005
Well, I think we have...

321
00:27:14,085 --> 00:27:17,085
<i> "My dearest darling Peaches.</i>

322
00:27:17,165 --> 00:27:19,605
<i>What a weight is off my mind.</i>

323
00:27:19,685 --> 00:27:22,365
<i>Monckton really did come up
with the goods,</i>

324
00:27:22,445 --> 00:27:26,165
<i>and his friends really do seem
to want to help me.</i>

325
00:27:26,245 --> 00:27:28,205
<i>Now, all I must do is wait,</i>

326
00:27:28,285 --> 00:27:32,085
<i>while they discreetly make
representations on my behalf.</i>

327
00:27:33,525 --> 00:27:35,325
<i>I would say 'wait and pray, '</i>

328
00:27:36,045 --> 00:27:39,205
<i>but all taste for prayer has left me,
as I survey</i>

329
00:27:39,285 --> 00:27:42,525
<i>the madness involving
the American evangelist here.</i>

330
00:27:42,605 --> 00:27:46,045
<i>What has happened to the people
of this country,</i>

331
00:27:46,125 --> 00:27:50,405
<i>turning like lemmings to this
crusading showman from Charlotte</i>

332
00:27:50,485 --> 00:27:51,725
<i>for their inspiration?</i>

333
00:27:53,245 --> 00:27:56,965
<i>Rumor reached me that Shirley Temple
even invited the fool</i>

334
00:27:57,045 --> 00:27:59,285
<i>to preach at Windsor Chapel.</i>

335
00:27:59,365 --> 00:28:02,925
<i>Can you imagine the banality
of those exchanges?</i>

336
00:28:03,005 --> 00:28:06,645
<i>The smugness,
self-congratulation and hypocrisy.</i>

337
00:28:07,525 --> 00:28:10,365
<i>What a grotesque occasion
that must have been.</i>

338
00:28:11,605 --> 00:28:15,525
<i>Now bed calls, and for once,
as my head hits the pillow</i>

339
00:28:15,605 --> 00:28:21,125
<i>without yours beside me,
I can truthfully say, all is well.</i>

340
00:28:21,205 --> 00:28:24,085
<i>Today was a day worth living.</i>

341
00:28:24,165 --> 00:28:27,325
<i>Your loving husband, David."</i>

342
00:28:31,805 --> 00:28:33,885
- Good morning, sir.
- Primed and ready?

343
00:28:33,965 --> 00:28:35,405
Ready for you now, sir.

344
00:28:40,245 --> 00:28:43,685
I received a visit yesterday afternoon
from John Wheeler-Bennett,

345
00:28:45,325 --> 00:28:49,685
the senior historian in charge
of publishing the German war files,

346
00:28:49,805 --> 00:28:54,845
who informed me that this government
was now left with no choice

347
00:28:54,925 --> 00:28:56,645
but to publish certain material,

348
00:28:56,725 --> 00:28:59,765
which both my predecessor,
Winston Churchill,

349
00:28:59,845 --> 00:29:03,325
and yours, your late father,
tried to suppress.

350
00:29:03,405 --> 00:29:04,405
What material?

351
00:29:05,245 --> 00:29:07,125
The Marburg Files, ma'am.

352
00:29:46,085 --> 00:29:48,965
This was always going to come back
to haunt us.

353
00:29:54,205 --> 00:29:58,845
Shortly after the war ended,
some British troops...

354
00:29:58,925 --> 00:30:01,805
Uh... American.

355
00:30:04,565 --> 00:30:08,745
American troops arrested
a German soldier,

356
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:10,389
as he was retreating from...

357
00:30:11,725 --> 00:30:16,125
Treffurt. Near Eisenach.
In central Germany.

358
00:30:16,205 --> 00:30:18,085
I don't remember the soldier's name.

359
00:30:20,085 --> 00:30:22,165
<i>Leutnant </i>von Loesch.

360
00:30:22,965 --> 00:30:24,318
Turns out,

361
00:30:24,343 --> 00:30:27,109
this soldier was Hitler's personal
translator.

362
00:30:27,165 --> 00:30:28,725
Uh...

363
00:30:30,085 --> 00:30:32,885
The assistant to Hitler's
personal translator, ma'am.

364
00:30:32,965 --> 00:30:36,965
Hitler's personal translator
was Dr Schmidt, Dr Paul Schmidt.

365
00:30:37,045 --> 00:30:40,325
All right, you tell the story, Michael.
Please.

366
00:30:42,125 --> 00:30:43,245
Thank you, ma'am.

367
00:30:48,125 --> 00:30:51,245
When his offices were being evacuated...

368
00:30:54,245 --> 00:30:59,605
<i> ...Dr. Schmidt</i>
<i>asked his assistant, von Loesch,</i>

369
00:30:59,685 --> 00:31:02,392
<i>to dispose of all the top-secret papers,</i>

370
00:31:02,417 --> 00:31:04,869
<i>which he had placed in archives.</i>

371
00:31:06,405 --> 00:31:09,965
<i>Von Loesch duly burnt the vast majority.</i>

372
00:31:13,885 --> 00:31:18,085
<i>But, he secretly kept
the most valuable material,</i>

373
00:31:18,885 --> 00:31:23,925
<i>hoping to use it to negotiate
his freedom and to escape trial.</i>

374
00:31:47,885 --> 00:31:50,685
<i>Among the papers
which von Loesch kept back,</i>

375
00:31:50,765 --> 00:31:54,885
<i>there was one file pertaining
to Anglo-German relations,</i>

376
00:31:54,965 --> 00:31:58,285
<i>in particular, the relationship
of Nazi high command</i>

377
00:31:58,365 --> 00:32:00,765
<i>with His Royal Highness,
the Duke of Windsor.</i>

378
00:32:03,685 --> 00:32:08,565
I think it's fair to say, the reality
exceeded even our worst fears.

379
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:12,925
<i>- We did everything to contain this...</i>
- That's your lot.

380
00:32:13,005 --> 00:32:15,645
<i>...unaware that a copy
had been sent to the Americans...</i>

381
00:32:20,885 --> 00:32:24,805
...who are now insisting that this volume
of the Marburg Files...

382
00:32:26,285 --> 00:32:27,445
be published.

383
00:32:28,885 --> 00:32:30,432
And this is the man

384
00:32:30,457 --> 00:32:32,869
you inexplicably let
back into the country.

385
00:32:38,485 --> 00:32:40,245
I hope you have a strong stomach.

386
00:33:27,165 --> 00:33:28,765
Thank you, Joe.

387
00:33:52,925 --> 00:33:55,965
- Your Royal Highness.
- Foreign Secretary.

388
00:33:56,405 --> 00:33:57,885
- Please.
- Thank you.

389
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:02,885
You have loyal
and persistent friends, sir.

390
00:34:02,965 --> 00:34:04,325
Oh, thank you.

391
00:34:08,645 --> 00:34:11,965
Following their representations and...

392
00:34:12,045 --> 00:34:14,645
having given the matter careful thought,

393
00:34:14,765 --> 00:34:18,365
it looks like we now
have several options.

394
00:34:18,445 --> 00:34:19,685
Please.

395
00:34:19,765 --> 00:34:22,251
The first option I'd like you to look at

396
00:34:22,276 --> 00:34:25,309
would be the role
of ambassador to France.

397
00:34:35,845 --> 00:34:38,085
<i> To a happy and...</i>

398
00:34:38,565 --> 00:34:40,085
purposeful future.

399
00:34:40,165 --> 00:34:42,125
- Hear, hear!
- His Royal Highness.

400
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:44,245
His Royal Highness!

401
00:35:08,245 --> 00:35:12,445
<i> "My dearest darling one, I met</i>
<i>with the Foreign Secretary today</i>

402
00:35:12,525 --> 00:35:16,657
<i>who has managed to find three posts
where I could do something of value</i>

403
00:35:16,737 --> 00:35:20,245
<i>and importance. I am so happy.</i>

404
00:35:20,325 --> 00:35:23,645
<i>These posts would offer me the chance
to serve my country</i>

405
00:35:23,725 --> 00:35:25,165
<i>and make a difference.</i>

406
00:35:26,005 --> 00:35:30,925
<i>As to the green light, as far as
government is concerned, it's a go.</i>

407
00:35:31,725 --> 00:35:36,365
<i>Only one obstacle remains,
to get the blessing of the Crown,</i>

408
00:35:37,445 --> 00:35:40,965
<i>which involves a brief trip back
to that miserable mausoleum,</i>

409
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:43,245
<i>Buckingham Palace.</i>

410
00:35:48,205 --> 00:35:51,885
<i>Counting down the minutes
until I am back in your arms again.</i>

411
00:35:52,565 --> 00:35:57,885
<i>Your loving husband, David."</i>

412
00:36:21,925 --> 00:36:23,925
The Duke of Windsor, Your Majesty.

413
00:36:30,045 --> 00:36:32,485
Your Majesty.

414
00:36:37,005 --> 00:36:41,365
- Ah, yes. It's your first time back.
- In this room, yes.

415
00:36:42,525 --> 00:36:45,205
That color was me, French Gray.

416
00:36:50,845 --> 00:36:53,125
So, to what do we owe the pleasure?

417
00:36:53,205 --> 00:36:55,885
I assume it's about this new book
that you're writing.

418
00:36:56,405 --> 00:37:00,645
Oh, actually, I've come here today
on another matter. A job.

419
00:37:02,605 --> 00:37:05,045
That while I'm clearly
no longer a young man,

420
00:37:05,125 --> 00:37:07,205
I'm also not yet an old one

421
00:37:07,285 --> 00:37:10,245
and might be able
to usefully serve the Crown.

422
00:37:12,085 --> 00:37:16,325
You had a chance to serve this country,
the greatest chance.

423
00:37:17,725 --> 00:37:18,725
You gave it up.

424
00:37:20,205 --> 00:37:22,605
Well, I gave it up because of the way
my wife was treated,

425
00:37:22,685 --> 00:37:24,965
not because I no longer wished
to serve this country.

426
00:37:28,965 --> 00:37:33,845
Anyway, one or two ideas came up.
For jobs,

427
00:37:33,925 --> 00:37:37,485
which would require the blessing
both of government and Crown.

428
00:37:38,045 --> 00:37:40,205
Of course, before coming here
and bothering you,

429
00:37:40,285 --> 00:37:43,845
I made sure the support
would be given by government

430
00:37:43,925 --> 00:37:46,205
and I've been assured of that support.

431
00:37:46,285 --> 00:37:47,725
Support for what jobs?

432
00:37:47,805 --> 00:37:50,205
Well, three possibilities came up.

433
00:37:50,285 --> 00:37:53,005
The first is the ambassadorship
to France.

434
00:37:53,085 --> 00:37:55,525
The PM and Foreign Secretary aren't keen

435
00:37:55,605 --> 00:37:58,005
on the incumbent, Gladwyn Jebb.

436
00:37:58,085 --> 00:37:59,645
And the second option?

437
00:38:00,885 --> 00:38:03,725
Oh, uh, as a special
liaison to the Board of Trade.

438
00:38:05,685 --> 00:38:06,805
The third?

439
00:38:07,845 --> 00:38:09,858
As, uh, High Commissioner,

440
00:38:09,883 --> 00:38:12,429
working with the Commonwealth
Relations Office

441
00:38:12,485 --> 00:38:15,365
to protect and promote British interests
throughout the world.

442
00:38:15,445 --> 00:38:16,605
This would suit me, I think,

443
00:38:16,685 --> 00:38:21,205
uh, as it specializes
in the practical side of diplomatic work.

444
00:38:22,325 --> 00:38:23,525
Entertaining.

445
00:38:26,565 --> 00:38:31,605
Well, I'm sure that you'd do
all three jobs very well indeed.

446
00:38:34,925 --> 00:38:38,125
But in light of what I've recently
learned about...

447
00:38:38,205 --> 00:38:39,445
About what?

448
00:38:40,445 --> 00:38:45,085
About events that took place,
while you were in Lisbon during the war.

449
00:38:45,165 --> 00:38:48,085
- From whom?
- From state papers.

450
00:38:48,165 --> 00:38:49,605
Which state papers?

451
00:38:49,685 --> 00:38:51,405
German state papers...

452
00:38:53,685 --> 00:38:59,125
which American historians,
supported by the French and the British,

453
00:38:59,205 --> 00:39:01,325
are now threatening to publish.

454
00:39:01,845 --> 00:39:04,085
And what exactly is in these papers?

455
00:39:05,805 --> 00:39:08,445
Letters. And telegrams.

456
00:39:08,525 --> 00:39:09,985
Communications

457
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:13,389
detailing your relationship
with Nazi high command.

458
00:39:13,445 --> 00:39:15,125
Well, it's utter nonsense.

459
00:39:16,765 --> 00:39:18,925
In one telegram, from 1940,

460
00:39:19,445 --> 00:39:23,125
it states that you were considering
publicly going against the government

461
00:39:23,205 --> 00:39:25,525
and pledging your support
for peace with Germany,

462
00:39:25,605 --> 00:39:27,805
thereby breaking
with my father, the King.

463
00:39:27,885 --> 00:39:31,125
In another, it says that,
in return for your support,

464
00:39:31,205 --> 00:39:34,125
the German government
offered you a home in Spain,

465
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:37,645
where you could wait out the rest
of the war in peace and safety

466
00:39:37,725 --> 00:39:39,725
while your countrymen gave their lives.

467
00:39:39,805 --> 00:39:42,845
I went to the Bahamas
as the British government instructed.

468
00:39:42,925 --> 00:39:46,845
Yes, you were instructed to go
to the Bahamas because of your views.

469
00:39:49,605 --> 00:39:51,311
In these papers,

470
00:39:51,336 --> 00:39:54,909
you're quoted as saying
that the Führer's desire for peace

471
00:39:54,965 --> 00:39:58,645
was in complete agreement
with your own point of view.

472
00:40:07,365 --> 00:40:09,205
You were too young to remember.

473
00:40:10,045 --> 00:40:11,445
I, alas, not.

474
00:40:13,205 --> 00:40:16,925
Hitler and his henchmen
were once our friends.

475
00:40:17,005 --> 00:40:23,165
As King, I was committed to the idea,
passionately committed,

476
00:40:23,245 --> 00:40:25,885
that England and Germany
should never be enemies again

477
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:28,365
after the horrors of the Great War.

478
00:40:28,445 --> 00:40:33,685
People forget, there was no indication
of who Hitler would become.

479
00:40:34,285 --> 00:40:38,645
You could argue that we were the ones
that made a monster of him,

480
00:40:38,725 --> 00:40:41,965
by refusing to be his allies.
This is the point.

481
00:40:42,685 --> 00:40:43,685
People make stands.

482
00:40:43,765 --> 00:40:48,045
They grandstand to pat themselves
on the back for their great virtue.

483
00:40:48,125 --> 00:40:51,205
And what is the consequence?
Another grotesque war.

484
00:40:51,285 --> 00:40:53,245
Millions more dead.

485
00:40:54,125 --> 00:40:56,805
When peace was all that mattered to me.

486
00:40:59,045 --> 00:41:04,765
In that spirit, I am asking you to make
peace with me today.

487
00:41:07,525 --> 00:41:10,125
Elizabeth, the British
are a sensible people;

488
00:41:10,205 --> 00:41:12,685
they will never believe
these claims against me.

489
00:41:14,045 --> 00:41:17,725
They will dismiss these papers
for what they are:

490
00:41:19,325 --> 00:41:23,445
baseless rumors and German propaganda.

491
00:41:42,085 --> 00:41:43,485
Everything all right?

492
00:41:47,165 --> 00:41:51,565
- Can I ask your opinion?
- Of course. What about?

493
00:41:52,045 --> 00:41:53,805
Forgiveness.

494
00:41:54,485 --> 00:41:56,325
Goodness. What have I done now?

495
00:41:57,205 --> 00:41:58,645
No, not you.

496
00:41:59,325 --> 00:42:01,005
Uncle David.

497
00:42:02,765 --> 00:42:05,525
- I think it's time that he be forgiven.
- Are you mad?

498
00:42:05,605 --> 00:42:08,045
- You can't forgive that man.
- Why not?

499
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:09,605
What he did to this country.

500
00:42:09,685 --> 00:42:13,845
Those were different times.
He's explained all that to me.

501
00:42:13,925 --> 00:42:15,405
Mm, I bet he did.

502
00:42:16,085 --> 00:42:17,245
Philip.

503
00:42:18,965 --> 00:42:21,165
Forgiveness is very important to me.

504
00:42:22,245 --> 00:42:27,365
It's not often I say this, so perhaps
if I do, you will take it seriously.

505
00:42:32,125 --> 00:42:35,725
Ask Tommy Lascelles to come and see you.

506
00:42:37,045 --> 00:42:38,765
What?

507
00:42:38,845 --> 00:42:40,925
And tell him
of your proposed course of action.

508
00:42:41,005 --> 00:42:43,845
- I can't keep summoning him like that.
- Why not?

509
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:47,485
- Well, he's retired for one thing.
- Well, then go and see him,

510
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,245
in an unofficial capacity.

511
00:42:49,325 --> 00:42:51,445
For sherry or tea.

512
00:42:51,525 --> 00:42:53,965
Or human blood,
whatever that monster drinks.

513
00:42:54,765 --> 00:42:57,065
And ask him about your uncle.

514
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:59,483
He was his private secretary
while he was King.

515
00:42:59,885 --> 00:43:01,645
He knows everything there is to know.

516
00:43:39,445 --> 00:43:42,805
- Your Majesty.
- Tommy, is it terribly inconvenient?

517
00:43:46,725 --> 00:43:47,885
Ah!

518
00:43:47,965 --> 00:43:50,485
- You're mid-battle!
- Yes, ma'am.

519
00:43:51,445 --> 00:43:53,245
Now, don't say anything.

520
00:43:53,485 --> 00:43:54,485
Ah...

521
00:43:55,045 --> 00:43:56,965
Yes, those uniforms...

522
00:43:57,045 --> 00:43:59,685
- It's 19th century?
- Yes.

523
00:44:00,365 --> 00:44:02,445
And that standard
is the Duke of Wellington.

524
00:44:02,525 --> 00:44:03,645
Very good, ma'am.

525
00:44:04,205 --> 00:44:05,445
So it's Waterloo.

526
00:44:06,365 --> 00:44:07,965
- Salamanca.
- Ah.

527
00:44:09,925 --> 00:44:12,445
Ah... And these?

528
00:44:12,525 --> 00:44:15,765
Troops of Sir Edward Pakenham's
Third Infantry Division.

529
00:44:15,845 --> 00:44:18,283
Oh, they're lovely.
Did you have them made?

530
00:44:18,685 --> 00:44:20,285
A gift, ma'am.

531
00:44:20,365 --> 00:44:23,183
From your grandfather,
when I was in his service.

532
00:44:23,325 --> 00:44:24,325
Hmm.

533
00:44:25,045 --> 00:44:27,463
- Shall we, ma'am?
- Yes.

534
00:44:34,965 --> 00:44:39,485
I'm proposing to let the Duke of Windsor
back into public life.

535
00:44:40,645 --> 00:44:46,125
And, as an example of a Christian
in a Christian country, to forgive.

536
00:44:48,565 --> 00:44:51,165
Your Majesty, that would...

537
00:44:52,085 --> 00:44:54,085
In my view...

538
00:44:54,165 --> 00:44:55,205
Be a mistake.

539
00:44:57,365 --> 00:44:58,445
Why?

540
00:45:00,205 --> 00:45:01,845
Before you make your decision, ma'am,

541
00:45:01,925 --> 00:45:05,125
I believe you should be
in full possession of the facts.

542
00:45:05,205 --> 00:45:08,685
- I've read the Marburg Files.
- So have I.

543
00:45:08,765 --> 00:45:10,485
I said<i> full</i> possession.

544
00:45:12,605 --> 00:45:15,085
- You mean there's more.
- Yes, ma'am.

545
00:45:17,485 --> 00:45:19,917
<i> The Duke of Windsor</i>
<i>made his loyalties clear</i>

546
00:45:19,942 --> 00:45:21,510
<i>as soon as he became King.</i>

547
00:45:22,245 --> 00:45:25,845
<i>Surrounded himself
with a new breed of courtier,</i>

548
00:45:25,925 --> 00:45:30,765
<i>men such as Carl,
the Duke of Saxe-Coburg, a renowned Nazi.</i>

549
00:45:31,538 --> 00:45:35,458
<i>He also shared classified Allied
documents with the Duchess of Windsor,</i>

550
00:45:35,538 --> 00:45:39,418
<i>who was herself, we believe,
sharing a bed...</i>

551
00:45:39,498 --> 00:45:42,578
<i>forgive me, ma'am...
with the German ambassador,</i>

552
00:45:42,658 --> 00:45:44,298
<i>Herr Ribbentrop.</i>

553
00:46:00,938 --> 00:46:02,378
<i>It became so bad that the government</i>

554
00:46:02,458 --> 00:46:05,658
<i>had to stop putting secret
and sensitive papers in his red box.</i>

555
00:46:06,458 --> 00:46:11,178
<i>But we needn't have worried,
because then we had the abdication.</i>

556
00:46:15,458 --> 00:46:17,778
<i>Having promised to retire
from public life,</i>

557
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:20,178
<i>we now know that he had
no such intention.</i>

558
00:46:20,978 --> 00:46:24,538
Why else would the pair of them
decide to visit Hitler in Germany?

559
00:46:31,818 --> 00:46:32,818
<i> Heil Hitler!</i>

560
00:46:32,898 --> 00:46:34,098
<i> Heil Hitler!</i>

561
00:46:34,178 --> 00:46:38,138
<i> The Führer labeled the trip</i>
<i>an unofficial state visit,</i>

562
00:46:38,218 --> 00:46:41,418
<i>so it is unsurprising that it was
on that same trip,</i>

563
00:46:41,498 --> 00:46:45,418
<i>at the home of Herr Hess,
that the plan was hatched.</i>

564
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:53,258
A plan to reinstate the Duke of Windsor
as King of England...

565
00:46:54,498 --> 00:46:58,498
effectively betraying and dethroning
your dear late father,

566
00:46:58,578 --> 00:47:03,338
in return for German forces being given
free rein across Europe.

567
00:47:04,418 --> 00:47:08,531
<i>German troops were even promised
to quell a colonial rebellion,</i>

568
00:47:08,556 --> 00:47:10,362
<i>if necessary.</i>

569
00:47:10,418 --> 00:47:13,298
<i>And there were visits
to SS training schools</i>

570
00:47:13,378 --> 00:47:16,378
<i>and early versions
of the concentration camps.</i>

571
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:17,338
<i>Now, of course,</i>

572
00:47:17,418 --> 00:47:20,018
the full horrors were yet to come.

573
00:47:20,098 --> 00:47:22,858
Nonetheless, he visited.

574
00:47:30,218 --> 00:47:31,898
Shall I continue, ma'am?

575
00:47:36,938 --> 00:47:39,498
When a German aircraft crashed in Belgium

576
00:47:39,578 --> 00:47:43,018
carrying Hitler's entire military plan
for the invasion of France,

577
00:47:43,098 --> 00:47:47,058
the Duke wasted no time in letting
his Nazi friends know

578
00:47:47,138 --> 00:47:51,658
that Allied forces had, indeed,
recovered this priceless information,

579
00:47:51,738 --> 00:47:55,698
which gave Germany time
to change its plans.

580
00:47:55,778 --> 00:48:00,498
And, in less than a month,
Paris fell to German occupation.

581
00:48:01,538 --> 00:48:04,418
But perhaps worst of all, the Duke

582
00:48:04,498 --> 00:48:08,178
told the German government
that resolve in the United Kingdom

583
00:48:08,258 --> 00:48:10,258
in the face of the German
aerial bombardment

584
00:48:10,338 --> 00:48:14,258
was weakening
and that continued bombing...

585
00:48:14,338 --> 00:48:17,591
that is, the continued slaughter
of his fellow countrymen

586
00:48:17,616 --> 00:48:18,962
and former subjects,

587
00:48:19,018 --> 00:48:24,338
would, I quote,
"soon make Britain ready for peace."

588
00:48:50,698 --> 00:48:53,058
<i> The problems of the world</i>
<i>can be summed up</i>

589
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:55,138
<i>in one three-letter word:</i>

590
00:48:55,218 --> 00:48:58,138
<i>S-I-N.</i>

591
00:48:58,218 --> 00:48:59,218
<i>Sin.</i>

592
00:49:00,698 --> 00:49:04,658
<i>From Psalm 58, "The wicked
are estranged from the womb.</i>

593
00:49:04,738 --> 00:49:08,978
<i>They go astray as soon as they be born,
speaking lies."</i>

594
00:49:09,058 --> 00:49:13,138
<i>God looks deep down inside of you.</i>

595
00:49:13,218 --> 00:49:16,418
<i>God sees how you really are down inside.</i>

596
00:49:16,498 --> 00:49:20,058
<i>Now, you may be outwardly genteel,
refined, cultured,</i>

597
00:49:20,138 --> 00:49:22,818
<i>a churchman,
of good standing in the community,</i>

598
00:49:22,898 --> 00:49:25,618
<i>but is your heart far from God?</i>

599
00:49:31,858 --> 00:49:35,298
I've had a chance to think about
your request to serve your country.

600
00:49:37,698 --> 00:49:41,218
I was keen to help you
and, weighing it all up...

601
00:49:42,858 --> 00:49:48,378
the amount of time that has passed
and my affection for you, personally,

602
00:49:48,898 --> 00:49:50,618
all spoke in its favor.

603
00:49:52,418 --> 00:49:53,258
But?

604
00:49:56,818 --> 00:49:59,018
But, on balance...

605
00:50:00,978 --> 00:50:01,978
I think not.

606
00:50:04,138 --> 00:50:06,218
And I'm sure you don't need reminding

607
00:50:06,298 --> 00:50:09,018
that under the terms of the agreement
reached after the abdication,

608
00:50:09,098 --> 00:50:12,218
you are permitted to return to
the United Kingdom only at the pleasure

609
00:50:12,298 --> 00:50:13,898
and invitation of the sovereign.

610
00:50:15,658 --> 00:50:16,658
Yes?

611
00:50:17,858 --> 00:50:20,818
I find myself unable to grant
that permission.

612
00:50:24,498 --> 00:50:28,418
And who has fed you this poison?
Your mother?

613
00:50:29,698 --> 00:50:30,938
No.

614
00:50:31,898 --> 00:50:32,938
Tommy Lascelles?

615
00:50:33,418 --> 00:50:36,418
- I came to my own mind.
- But you have no mind of your own.

616
00:50:36,498 --> 00:50:38,458
That's why everyone's so thrilled
with you.

617
00:50:39,258 --> 00:50:40,965
The last royal to have
a mind of his own was me

618
00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:43,042
and that's why they threw me out.

619
00:50:43,098 --> 00:50:46,298
Fine. I will go.

620
00:50:47,418 --> 00:50:48,938
But let me ask you this.

621
00:50:50,658 --> 00:50:53,018
Who has done more damage to the monarchy?

622
00:50:53,098 --> 00:50:57,498
Me, with my willfulness, or you lot,
with your inhumanity?

623
00:51:02,138 --> 00:51:07,458
We all closed our eyes, our ears,
to what was being said about you.

624
00:51:08,658 --> 00:51:12,818
We dismissed it as fabrications,
as cruel chatter,

625
00:51:12,898 --> 00:51:15,058
in light of your decision
to give up the throne.

626
00:51:16,058 --> 00:51:18,218
But when the truth finally came out...

627
00:51:18,298 --> 00:51:19,618
The truth!

628
00:51:22,018 --> 00:51:25,138
It makes a mockery of even
the central tenets of Christianity.

629
00:51:25,938 --> 00:51:28,338
There is no possibility
of my forgiving you.

630
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:33,298
How on earth can you forgive yourself?

631
00:52:02,258 --> 00:52:04,498
- How was your trip?
- Sir!

632
00:52:04,578 --> 00:52:07,538
- How's the Duchess?
- Your Royal Highness!

633
00:52:09,818 --> 00:52:10,818
Sir!

634
00:52:18,378 --> 00:52:19,938
- Good morning, sir.
- Morning.

635
00:52:20,058 --> 00:52:22,658
- Morning.
- Morning, sir.

636
00:52:22,738 --> 00:52:25,178
- Morning, sir.
- Morning.

637
00:52:29,658 --> 00:52:31,258
We have the go-ahead to publish.

638
00:52:32,378 --> 00:52:33,738
Thank you, sir.

639
00:53:14,258 --> 00:53:15,898
Reverend Graham, Your Majesty.

640
00:53:16,778 --> 00:53:17,778
Your Majesty.

641
00:53:21,418 --> 00:53:23,418
You're very kind to find time
for me again.

642
00:53:26,658 --> 00:53:27,738
Oh, do sit down.

643
00:53:37,658 --> 00:53:39,498
Reverend Graham, uh...

644
00:53:40,338 --> 00:53:42,698
I asked you here today because...

645
00:53:42,778 --> 00:53:47,098
there's something that I'd very much like
to hear your views on.

646
00:53:48,098 --> 00:53:49,178
Ma'am?

647
00:53:51,138 --> 00:53:52,338
Forgiveness.

648
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:57,498
Are there any circumstances, do you feel,

649
00:53:57,578 --> 00:54:03,378
where one can be a good Christian
and yet not forgive?

650
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:12,258
Christian teaching's very clear on this.
No one is beneath forgiveness.

651
00:54:12,338 --> 00:54:13,871
Dying on the cross, Jesus

652
00:54:13,896 --> 00:54:16,802
himself asked the Lord to forgive
those that killed him.

653
00:54:18,738 --> 00:54:19,738
Yes.

654
00:54:22,338 --> 00:54:26,138
But... we must remember his words.

655
00:54:26,698 --> 00:54:28,658
"They know not what they do."

656
00:54:30,258 --> 00:54:32,938
That forgiveness, it was conditional.

657
00:54:33,658 --> 00:54:36,938
True, but he still forgave.

658
00:54:37,018 --> 00:54:42,658
God himself forgives us all. Who are we
to reject the example of God?

659
00:54:42,738 --> 00:54:44,098
Mere mortals.

660
00:54:45,138 --> 00:54:48,005
We are all mortals, that is our fate,

661
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:50,722
but we need not be un-Christian ones.

662
00:55:00,698 --> 00:55:03,938
The solution for being unable to forgive:

663
00:55:04,738 --> 00:55:07,898
one asks for forgiveness oneself.

664
00:55:07,978 --> 00:55:14,298
Humbly and sincerely, and one prays
for those that one cannot forgive.

665
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:31,458
Saying one for me?

666
00:56:32,578 --> 00:56:36,138
- Not on this occasion, no.
- Go on. Put a word in.

667
00:56:36,938 --> 00:56:39,738
We all know you have
the ear of the big man upstairs,

668
00:56:39,818 --> 00:56:42,778
- as, as head of his church.
- Oh, you're drunk.

669
00:56:42,858 --> 00:56:44,698
- I am. I don't deny it.
- Get off.

670
00:56:44,778 --> 00:56:48,658
But not nearly as drunk as either
of my drinking companions tonight.

671
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:50,898
- Care to take a guess?
- I wouldn't dare.

672
00:56:52,258 --> 00:56:54,618
Your de... your de...

673
00:56:54,698 --> 00:56:56,778
Your dear Ma was one.

674
00:56:57,858 --> 00:56:59,258
What?!

675
00:56:59,338 --> 00:57:01,698
And Tommy Lascelles the other.

676
00:57:01,778 --> 00:57:03,418
- No.
- Yes!

677
00:57:04,698 --> 00:57:07,138
I know. Hideous thought.

678
00:57:07,218 --> 00:57:11,018
But we all agreed to put aside
our historical differences

679
00:57:11,098 --> 00:57:13,338
to celebrate the one good thing
we all have in common.

680
00:57:13,418 --> 00:57:14,538
Which is?

681
00:57:15,498 --> 00:57:16,498
You.

682
00:57:17,938 --> 00:57:24,818
And the heroic way
you kicked that wretched fool out today,

683
00:57:24,898 --> 00:57:26,138
tail between his legs.

684
00:57:26,218 --> 00:57:27,385
It was hardly heroic.

685
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:29,082
On the contrary, it was entirely heroic.

686
00:57:29,138 --> 00:57:30,898
And don't, don't for one minute

687
00:57:30,978 --> 00:57:33,858
start on about it being
a failure of Christianity.

688
00:57:33,938 --> 00:57:36,578
- Uh, it is.
- No. It's not.
