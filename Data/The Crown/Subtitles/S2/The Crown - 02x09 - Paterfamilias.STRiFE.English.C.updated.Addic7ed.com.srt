1
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,280
Over here!

2
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:21,433
I'm afraid it's true.

3
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,117
His Royal Highness has struggled.

4
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,061
And whilst Her Majesty's desire to have

5
00:00:27,073 --> 00:00:29,295
her son be the first heir to the throne

6
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,680
to attend a normal school is laudable,

7
00:00:32,203 --> 00:00:35,203
and we were delighted
to have His Royal Highness at Cheam...

8
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,280
we should not delude ourselves...

9
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,160
that it has been entirely successful.

10
00:00:44,714 --> 00:00:45,867
Thank you.

11
00:00:47,473 --> 00:00:50,539
The press run stories
about him almost daily.

12
00:00:51,443 --> 00:00:53,963
The other boys read about him
in the newspapers.

13
00:00:54,619 --> 00:00:56,093
They see his detective.

14
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,851
We do what we can, but...

15
00:00:59,662 --> 00:01:01,320
boys that age can be cruel.

16
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,929
The fact is, His Royal
Highness is different.

17
00:01:08,018 --> 00:01:11,938
And not just because of who he is,
who his parents are.

18
00:01:12,842 --> 00:01:14,507
He's uncommonly shy.

19
00:01:15,335 --> 00:01:16,554
Sensitive.

20
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,240
Delicate.

21
00:01:21,587 --> 00:01:25,968
So, if you're asking me where,
in my professional opinion,

22
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:27,866
he should go to senior school...

23
00:01:29,164 --> 00:01:30,284
Yes, I am.

24
00:01:31,204 --> 00:01:35,604
I would say that in Eton College,
you have the perfect solution.

25
00:01:35,871 --> 00:01:37,210
Right on your doorstep.

26
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:42,046
Look, Charles!

27
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:45,309
Look, you'll be so much closer to us.

28
00:01:45,334 --> 00:01:49,334
The weekends, you can just run up
the hill and you'll be with us all.

29
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,680
And you can sleep in your own bed.

30
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:57,062
I have to ask Daddy,
but I'm sure he'll agree.

31
00:02:00,692 --> 00:02:02,052
Dear Uncle Dickie,

32
00:02:02,406 --> 00:02:04,660
Mommy told me that she had chosen Eton

33
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:06,760
College for me for senior school.

34
00:02:07,013 --> 00:02:10,835
I must say, I was very relieved
and now find myself very excited.

35
00:02:11,581 --> 00:02:13,812
Being at Eton makes so much sense.

36
00:02:14,276 --> 00:02:16,316
Am I right in thinking
that you went there, too?

37
00:02:17,101 --> 00:02:19,040
I was never at Eton.

38
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,400
I was tormented by a
particularly dull tutor at home.

39
00:02:23,488 --> 00:02:25,808
Then I was sent to the
Naval College in Osborne.

40
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,046
So, I'm very envious of Eton.

41
00:02:30,022 --> 00:02:32,242
What great fun you'll have there.

42
00:02:32,716 --> 00:02:36,796
And may I suggest a gentleman's
outing to meet Arthur Cunningham,

43
00:02:37,187 --> 00:02:40,734
head cutter of the finest House
in Savile Row?

44
00:02:40,872 --> 00:02:43,632
- Sir.
- Is that a two in the hand?

45
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,600
- Yes, sir.
- Also known as?

46
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,760
- The Eton knot.
- The Eton knot.

47
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,360
And shoot the cuffs.

48
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,570
I think slightly higher on the shoulder.

49
00:02:51,595 --> 00:02:53,075
Yes, sir. Quarter of an inch.

50
00:02:54,197 --> 00:03:00,637
And we position the hat with the thumbs.

51
00:03:01,371 --> 00:03:02,851
The Eton suit.

52
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:06,459
- Next size up?
- Five, sir.

53
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:07,619
Five?

54
00:03:07,644 --> 00:03:08,724
- Five.
- Five.

55
00:03:09,732 --> 00:03:11,652
Whites.

56
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,060
Breathe in.

57
00:03:17,935 --> 00:03:20,757
Good.

58
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,640
Thank you.

59
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,960
- Now, doesn't that lift the spirits?
- Yes, it does!

60
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,440
Finishing touch.

61
00:03:30,766 --> 00:03:31,966
Oh, yes!

62
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:40,515
synced and corrected by susinz
*www.addic7ed.com*

63
00:05:04,983 --> 00:05:06,303
Congratulations, sir!

64
00:05:12,774 --> 00:05:14,494
- Well done, you!
- Thank you!

65
00:05:14,574 --> 00:05:18,254
We won by half a length, which
is the nautical equivalent of a nose.

66
00:05:18,334 --> 00:05:22,234
- Ah. Neck! You've burnt your forehead.
- You should see my legs.

67
00:05:22,694 --> 00:05:23,934
Oh, thank you.

68
00:05:24,014 --> 00:05:27,614
We left it rather late admittedly.
But came good at the last marker.

69
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:30,976
Which is the nautical equivalent
of the final furlock.

70
00:05:31,601 --> 00:05:32,854
Furlong!

71
00:05:36,757 --> 00:05:38,654
After dinner you should
look in on Charles.

72
00:05:38,734 --> 00:05:40,854
To show him the trophy? Good idea.

73
00:05:40,934 --> 00:05:43,134
No. I thought to compliment
him on his uniforms.

74
00:05:43,214 --> 00:05:45,820
- What uniforms?
- His uniforms for Eton.

75
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:48,214
What are you talking about?
Charles is going to Gordonstoun.

76
00:05:48,294 --> 00:05:50,414
- Not necessarily.
- Yes, necessarily.

77
00:05:50,742 --> 00:05:52,774
- It's not set in stone.
- Give me a hammer and chisel

78
00:05:52,854 --> 00:05:54,054
and watch me carve it into one.

79
00:05:54,134 --> 00:05:54,642
Philip.

80
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:56,214
Gordonstoun is the right place for him.

81
00:05:56,294 --> 00:05:58,016
It's no exaggeration to say that school

82
00:05:58,028 --> 00:05:59,585
made me, and it can make Charles.

83
00:05:59,687 --> 00:06:01,374
He won't learn a thing
about himself at Eton.

84
00:06:01,454 --> 00:06:03,654
Yes, but he might just
survive or flourish.

85
00:06:03,734 --> 00:06:05,814
Or he might just become
another wet, namby-pamby,

86
00:06:05,894 --> 00:06:09,390
mollycoddled twit like the rest
of the British upper classes.

87
00:06:09,679 --> 00:06:12,554
Your Majesty, Your Royal Highness.

88
00:06:13,437 --> 00:06:15,342
Well, Dickie thinks it's
the right school for him.

89
00:06:15,367 --> 00:06:18,092
- It's none of Dickie's business.
- He's got a soft spot for Charles.

90
00:06:18,117 --> 00:06:19,534
- They write to one another.
- Since when?

91
00:06:19,614 --> 00:06:22,214
- He heard how unhappy Charles was.
- I wish he'd stop meddling.

92
00:06:22,294 --> 00:06:24,214
Well, meddling is what Dickie does.

93
00:06:24,371 --> 00:06:26,771
We would be betraying our son
if we let Eton have him.

94
00:06:26,906 --> 00:06:29,976
He's going to Gordonstoun,
and that's the end of it.

95
00:06:30,546 --> 00:06:32,574
All right, fine, if you feel
that strongly about it.

96
00:06:32,654 --> 00:06:35,134
- I do.
- We'll return the uniforms.

97
00:06:35,214 --> 00:06:36,992
You can burn them for all I care.

98
00:06:37,004 --> 00:06:39,254
But you can break it to Charles, not me.

99
00:06:40,014 --> 00:06:41,214
- Fine.
- Your Majesty.

100
00:06:41,294 --> 00:06:42,534
Thank you, James.

101
00:06:44,085 --> 00:06:47,654
I do like Scotland,
but isn't it a long way from home?

102
00:06:47,734 --> 00:06:49,814
- No.
- And a terrible inconvenience

103
00:06:49,894 --> 00:06:53,187
- for you to come and visit me there?
- No. Not at all.

104
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:58,375
I've already decided to fly you
up there myself as a special treat.

105
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:00,174
But...

106
00:07:00,574 --> 00:07:01,774
I won't lie to you.

107
00:07:02,765 --> 00:07:04,759
When I heard I was going to Gordonstoun,

108
00:07:04,771 --> 00:07:06,325
I felt exactly as you do now.

109
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,170
Wretched.

110
00:07:08,801 --> 00:07:11,481
I wanted to stay at home
with my dear, favorite sister.

111
00:07:12,427 --> 00:07:14,484
I wanted the easier, softer way.

112
00:07:14,648 --> 00:07:17,974
But in order to grow up properly,

113
00:07:18,054 --> 00:07:21,289
you need to get away
from all this nonsense.

114
00:07:23,374 --> 00:07:25,814
Would you like me to let you into
a big secret?

115
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,112
Please.

116
00:07:27,762 --> 00:07:32,609
This... is not the real world.

117
00:07:39,963 --> 00:07:41,923
John. Get rid of those.

118
00:07:43,101 --> 00:07:46,734
You can have my old jumper.
The uniform hasn't changed a bit.

119
00:07:46,814 --> 00:07:48,214
Pop your head through.

120
00:07:48,294 --> 00:07:49,734
That's the first lesson.

121
00:07:49,814 --> 00:07:53,054
Who we are is not what we
wear or what glitters.

122
00:07:53,571 --> 00:07:55,601
It's the spirit that defines us.

123
00:07:56,334 --> 00:07:57,534
In here.

124
00:08:06,042 --> 00:08:07,122
Philip?

125
00:08:08,428 --> 00:08:09,508
Philip?

126
00:08:32,694 --> 00:08:35,014
You're not really
going to fly him to school

127
00:08:35,094 --> 00:08:36,454
dressed for a funeral?

128
00:08:36,534 --> 00:08:37,534
Of course.

129
00:08:37,769 --> 00:08:40,009
One might as well be dressed
for the inevitable.

130
00:08:40,534 --> 00:08:42,781
If we land safely, I'll change.

131
00:08:45,116 --> 00:08:47,436
She's your sister!

132
00:08:51,494 --> 00:08:53,094
See you soon.

133
00:09:06,292 --> 00:09:07,732
Uh, yes, I'm Greek.

134
00:09:12,328 --> 00:09:14,568
Come along. Let's get this over with.

135
00:09:29,374 --> 00:09:31,214
Ja.

136
00:09:31,294 --> 00:09:36,014
Why did we do this? I hate flying.
We should have gone by train.

137
00:09:45,859 --> 00:09:47,499
Give me your hand.

138
00:09:49,934 --> 00:09:51,254
It's fine. Look at me.

139
00:09:51,334 --> 00:09:54,894
- It's all right. It's just air.
- Yes.

140
00:10:04,265 --> 00:10:06,694
- It's beautiful!
- It's freezing!

141
00:10:06,774 --> 00:10:08,774
Why couldn't I have stayed in Germany...

142
00:10:09,524 --> 00:10:10,724
and gone to school there?

143
00:10:11,245 --> 00:10:13,729
Because Father thought it very important

144
00:10:13,741 --> 00:10:15,925
that you be educated by a genius.

145
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:21,059
And since Dr. Hahn is a Jew,
staying in Germany was impossible.

146
00:10:21,611 --> 00:10:22,611
Fine.

147
00:10:23,602 --> 00:10:25,693
But why did the genius choose Scotland?

148
00:10:52,574 --> 00:10:54,094
Your Royal Highness.

149
00:10:54,934 --> 00:10:57,828
- Who's that?
- Some foreigner.

150
00:10:58,414 --> 00:11:00,304
- What's your name?
- Philip.

151
00:11:01,307 --> 00:11:02,507
Philip what?

152
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,069
It's just Philip.

153
00:11:05,483 --> 00:11:07,203
Hey. Back to work.

154
00:11:08,642 --> 00:11:11,242
Philip! Come along!

155
00:11:26,574 --> 00:11:30,134
Your Royal Highness!

156
00:11:30,214 --> 00:11:32,374
The big day began at London Airport,

157
00:11:32,539 --> 00:11:34,734
where the Duke of Edinburgh
surprised Prince Charles

158
00:11:34,814 --> 00:11:37,014
with the decision to fly him to school.

159
00:11:37,094 --> 00:11:39,294
This is the really modern
way to go to school.

160
00:11:39,374 --> 00:11:41,934
By airplane, piloted by your father,

161
00:11:42,014 --> 00:11:45,294
on this most important
day for our future king.

162
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,693
- Welcome!
- My dear Dr. Hahn.

163
00:12:02,718 --> 00:12:04,578
- Welcome home, sir.
- It's good to be back.

164
00:12:05,215 --> 00:12:07,175
Mr. Tennant, the head of Charles's year.

165
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,408
- Your Royal Highness.
- Pleasure.

166
00:12:10,044 --> 00:12:12,132
- Good morning, boys!
- Good morning, sir.

167
00:12:14,236 --> 00:12:17,117
- Your Royal Highness. Welcome.
- Thank you.

168
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:20,023
You know this school runs
in your father's blood.

169
00:12:20,296 --> 00:12:22,174
He was one of the first pupils here.

170
00:12:22,523 --> 00:12:25,742
- He helped build the place.
- I did, I built that wall.

171
00:12:26,226 --> 00:12:29,281
Yes. Things have changed
a little since your father's time.

172
00:12:29,742 --> 00:12:31,814
But not the important things.

173
00:12:31,953 --> 00:12:33,774
The principles remain unchanged.

174
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:36,854
- Yeah, good. You haven't gone soft.
- No.

175
00:12:37,803 --> 00:12:40,515
Don't want him mollycoddled
in some luxury hotel.

176
00:12:45,574 --> 00:12:47,294
This way, Prince Charles!

177
00:12:48,454 --> 00:12:50,014
Are you ready for how tough it is?

178
00:12:50,094 --> 00:12:51,654
How do you feel being far away, sir?

179
00:12:51,734 --> 00:12:53,640
All right. Good. Thank you.

180
00:12:53,726 --> 00:12:55,174
Is this good for him, sir?

181
00:12:55,254 --> 00:12:56,814
Is this the right school for him?

182
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:04,109
This was your father's dormitory.
We've even given you his old bed.

183
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:05,850
- Hello, boys.
- Morning, sir.

184
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,574
Simon Harper, sir, dormitory guardian.

185
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:10,031
Simon will teach you the
rules and look after you.

186
00:13:10,242 --> 00:13:11,953
We've given you the window,
Your Royal Highness.

187
00:13:11,978 --> 00:13:14,148
No, no. Don't call him that.
It's just Charles.

188
00:13:14,254 --> 00:13:15,454
Yes, sir. Charles.

189
00:13:15,768 --> 00:13:17,765
Thank you. That's awfully kind.

190
00:13:19,409 --> 00:13:20,809
This is Geddes.

191
00:13:23,562 --> 00:13:24,574
Charles.

192
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,260
This is Gilkinson.

193
00:13:27,694 --> 00:13:30,014
Memories flooding back, sir?

194
00:13:30,461 --> 00:13:31,341
Yes.

195
00:13:31,614 --> 00:13:33,214
Happy ones, I hope.

196
00:13:33,294 --> 00:13:34,414
This is Griffiths.

197
00:13:34,517 --> 00:13:36,875
The happiest. Who's that?

198
00:13:38,564 --> 00:13:39,924
The royal detective.

199
00:13:41,701 --> 00:13:44,281
The palace insisted.
In case of press intrusion.

200
00:13:45,138 --> 00:13:47,338
The whole point is the boy
learns to fend for himself.

201
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:51,031
Don't worry. We know
what's expected of us.

202
00:13:54,273 --> 00:13:57,521
The Duke wasted no time
before signing Prince Charles up

203
00:13:57,546 --> 00:13:59,617
to Gordonstoun's infamous
Annual Challenge,

204
00:13:59,773 --> 00:14:02,820
notorious for testing
endurance and determination

205
00:14:03,117 --> 00:14:05,195
in the inhospitable Scottish Highlands.

206
00:14:05,492 --> 00:14:07,458
At Gordonstoun, fitness is valued just

207
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:09,292
as highly as academic excellence.

208
00:14:10,171 --> 00:14:12,131
The prince is sure to be put
through his paces

209
00:14:12,204 --> 00:14:14,265
by their grueling physical regime.

210
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,335
This is surely the place
to make our young prince

211
00:14:17,443 --> 00:14:20,323
into a man ready to serve his country.

212
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:31,574
It doesn't close. The thing's broken.

213
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:35,171
- The rain's getting in.
- The frame's broken, idiot.

214
00:14:39,854 --> 00:14:41,989
- Now what are you doing?
- Moving the bed.

215
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:44,334
- Put it back!
- But the sheets are getting wet.

216
00:14:44,359 --> 00:14:45,968
Put it back or I'll put you on report.

217
00:14:57,414 --> 00:14:58,562
Lights out!

218
00:15:13,443 --> 00:15:15,483
Come on, we're going to be late.

219
00:15:16,688 --> 00:15:17,728
Faster!

220
00:15:18,294 --> 00:15:19,534
Come on, lads.

221
00:15:20,614 --> 00:15:22,814
- Push out.
- Hurry up! Let's get it over with!

222
00:15:22,894 --> 00:15:25,494
- Out of my way.
- Let's go!

223
00:15:25,574 --> 00:15:26,734
Hurry up!

224
00:15:26,814 --> 00:15:30,214
Get up! Your Royal Highness.

225
00:15:32,174 --> 00:15:33,187
Move.

226
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,814
What's wrong?

227
00:15:48,429 --> 00:15:49,537
It's freezing.

228
00:15:49,562 --> 00:15:52,334
Wait until you've had
your cold shower! Come on!

229
00:16:02,414 --> 00:16:04,334
One more lap. Come on!

230
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:20,854
Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi!

231
00:16:24,854 --> 00:16:26,334
Right. Come on then!

232
00:16:38,907 --> 00:16:40,267
Move!

233
00:17:08,134 --> 00:17:09,285
Come on.

234
00:17:26,249 --> 00:17:27,449
Oi.

235
00:17:29,534 --> 00:17:32,614
Hey! Get down here!

236
00:17:33,403 --> 00:17:36,440
This isn't optional.
It's your assigned work project.

237
00:17:36,465 --> 00:17:37,785
It's manual labor.

238
00:17:38,082 --> 00:17:41,334
If Hahn wants this place rebuilt,
he ought to pay the staff to do it.

239
00:17:43,878 --> 00:17:44,958
Staff...

240
00:17:50,254 --> 00:17:52,207
Do you think you're better than us?

241
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:54,262
Actually, I know I am.

242
00:17:57,454 --> 00:18:00,863
- Keep a lookout. Oi. This will be good.
- Will do.

243
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:05,294
Some mongrel European count?

244
00:18:05,963 --> 00:18:07,083
It's prince, actually.

245
00:18:08,091 --> 00:18:09,891
We know all about your lot.

246
00:18:12,276 --> 00:18:15,137
Your sisters are all Nazis.

247
00:18:16,551 --> 00:18:18,762
And your father's
washed his hands of you

248
00:18:18,774 --> 00:18:20,785
so he can be with his whore in Paris.

249
00:18:22,254 --> 00:18:23,567
Uh... It's Monaco.

250
00:18:24,174 --> 00:18:30,231
Your mother's a mental defective,
locked away in some asylum.

251
00:18:30,847 --> 00:18:33,607
You're no one,
and you're going to do the work.

252
00:18:34,043 --> 00:18:38,098
Why? Because I bloody well say so.

253
00:18:44,614 --> 00:18:46,614
Get off!

254
00:18:48,654 --> 00:18:50,454
Get off!

255
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:02,551
Here!

256
00:19:15,934 --> 00:19:17,614
Sit yourself down.

257
00:19:24,241 --> 00:19:25,881
Jim threw the first punch.

258
00:19:25,934 --> 00:19:29,512
Mnh-mnh. I understand injustice.

259
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:31,246
We're both exiles.

260
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:35,500
Both victims and I
understand your anger.

261
00:19:37,332 --> 00:19:39,331
But on its current path,

262
00:19:39,356 --> 00:19:42,699
the world will fill with anger
and soon will be destroyed.

263
00:19:42,762 --> 00:19:45,887
So here, away from the madness,
we must build a new way.

264
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:49,494
A new school. A new philosophy.
A new ethos.

265
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:51,922
The world needs saviors.

266
00:19:52,684 --> 00:19:55,054
A generation of remarkable young men

267
00:19:55,134 --> 00:19:57,134
who have put fury behind them,

268
00:19:58,156 --> 00:20:00,996
who embrace their pain
and their struggle.

269
00:20:02,387 --> 00:20:05,147
All men must step into the unknown.

270
00:20:05,668 --> 00:20:11,028
There, only there,
in the annihilation of hate and anger,

271
00:20:12,442 --> 00:20:16,637
and ego, is our salvation.

272
00:20:18,621 --> 00:20:19,701
Hmm?

273
00:20:23,481 --> 00:20:27,014
I can't stay here. They're all mad.
Completely mad.

274
00:20:27,262 --> 00:20:30,254
Cousin Louis' wedding falls
in your half-term.

275
00:20:30,442 --> 00:20:31,814
Don wants to fly.

276
00:20:32,082 --> 00:20:33,716
I'll tell him I won't go and you can

277
00:20:33,728 --> 00:20:35,374
come and stay with me, in Germany.

278
00:20:35,531 --> 00:20:38,331
- Just the two of us?
- Probably.

279
00:20:39,694 --> 00:20:40,694
What does that mean?

280
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:43,734
I didn't tell you. I'm expecting.

281
00:20:43,814 --> 00:20:44,894
Expecting what?

282
00:20:44,974 --> 00:20:47,414
- A little one.
- A-again?

283
00:20:47,494 --> 00:20:50,731
Don't be like that.
Castles need to be filled.

284
00:20:51,145 --> 00:20:52,877
And Herr Hitler is
encouraging us to have

285
00:20:52,902 --> 00:20:54,294
as many children as we can.

286
00:20:54,374 --> 00:20:56,734
As Germany grows,
she will need more soldiers.

287
00:21:01,935 --> 00:21:03,418
Hello?

288
00:21:08,574 --> 00:21:09,840
Hello?

289
00:21:30,334 --> 00:21:31,414
Idiot!

290
00:21:54,965 --> 00:21:57,294
I thought I would come up here

291
00:21:57,374 --> 00:21:59,294
and see how you were settling in.

292
00:22:00,106 --> 00:22:01,334
Have you made friends?

293
00:22:01,414 --> 00:22:03,294
One. I think.

294
00:22:03,606 --> 00:22:06,694
Although, it's quite hard to understand
what he says sometimes.

295
00:22:07,452 --> 00:22:10,092
Yes, I hear they've
let some local boys in.

296
00:22:13,376 --> 00:22:14,416
Charles.

297
00:22:15,414 --> 00:22:21,654
Even though I am close to your father,
I am not your father.

298
00:22:22,654 --> 00:22:28,294
Things you feel you cannot
show him or tell him

299
00:22:28,374 --> 00:22:31,254
because you feel they might upset him...

300
00:22:31,981 --> 00:22:35,894
- Yes, sir.
- Or even disappoint him...

301
00:22:37,793 --> 00:22:40,694
Those are the things you can say to me,

302
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:42,871
safe in the knowledge that they will

303
00:22:42,883 --> 00:22:44,770
never be repeated to anyone else.

304
00:22:45,145 --> 00:22:47,543
Anyone else on earth.

305
00:22:48,317 --> 00:22:49,440
Yes, sir.

306
00:22:49,465 --> 00:22:53,035
Charles, if you're not happy
here, you must tell me

307
00:22:53,506 --> 00:22:55,986
and I will take care of it.

308
00:23:00,355 --> 00:23:01,235
Dumbo!

309
00:23:23,449 --> 00:23:26,649
What are you doing in here?
Why aren't you dressed for dinner?

310
00:23:27,449 --> 00:23:30,889
- I need to talk to you.
- What about?

311
00:23:33,068 --> 00:23:34,468
Could you close the door?

312
00:23:45,598 --> 00:23:47,462
I've made the decision to take Charles

313
00:23:47,474 --> 00:23:49,449
out of Gordonstoun and bring him home.

314
00:23:49,749 --> 00:23:51,789
Decide what you like.
He's staying there.

315
00:23:51,942 --> 00:23:53,971
Dickie's just reported
his unhappiness to me.

316
00:23:53,996 --> 00:23:56,497
Dickie's a meddling, interfering
fool who knows nothing.

317
00:23:56,522 --> 00:23:58,996
Well, he knows an unhappy
child when he sees one.

318
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,700
And by all accounts,
Charles is wretched.

319
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:04,430
He's tormented from the
moment that he wakes up

320
00:24:04,455 --> 00:24:06,335
to the moment that he goes to sleep.

321
00:24:07,192 --> 00:24:09,470
Do you know what he calls the place?

322
00:24:09,482 --> 00:24:11,900
"Hell on earth, Colditz with kilts."

323
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,660
- I don't want to debate this.
- Well, you have to.

324
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:18,380
And not just because he's your son.
Because he's the future king.

325
00:24:21,267 --> 00:24:23,907
Bullied children are scarred for life.

326
00:24:24,707 --> 00:24:26,780
And scarred children
make destroyed adults.

327
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,620
You and I had an agreement.

328
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,380
A deal that ensured there would be

329
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:33,420
some level of equality
between us in the marriage.

330
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:37,540
It's my decision Charles go
to Gordonstoun... not now!

331
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,580
And that would be fine,
for all our other children.

332
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:49,020
But Charles is the future of the Crown.

333
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:52,620
And in the name of the
Crown and as his mother,

334
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:56,460
I have decided to take him out
of Gordonstoun and bring him home,

335
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,740
to Eton, to Windsor, where he belongs.

336
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:01,340
You can't always fall back on the Crown.

337
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,460
Oh, yes, I can. And I will.

338
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:06,820
Then you would do well to remember
the promises you made to me.

339
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:10,465
And the consequence breaking those
might have on the Crown.

340
00:25:12,001 --> 00:25:13,535
Charles's education...

341
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:16,410
is my responsibility.

342
00:25:17,811 --> 00:25:20,611
Yours is to honor your word...

343
00:25:22,181 --> 00:25:24,574
and keep your husband.

344
00:26:27,921 --> 00:26:30,801
- Charles.
- Hello, sir.

345
00:26:31,584 --> 00:26:33,424
Are you preparing
for the Annual Challenge?

346
00:26:33,774 --> 00:26:34,934
I am.

347
00:26:35,163 --> 00:26:37,763
The Duke of Edinburgh
is giving the prize this year.

348
00:26:38,726 --> 00:26:39,886
I know.

349
00:26:40,857 --> 00:26:42,505
He's spoken to me a great deal about

350
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:44,177
the significance of the Challenge.

351
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,125
The Challenge is one of this school's

352
00:26:47,137 --> 00:26:49,434
great traditions, but it is arduous.

353
00:26:50,618 --> 00:26:51,778
You don't think I'm up to it.

354
00:26:53,348 --> 00:26:57,620
Physical endurance is only one path
to self-determination.

355
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,085
You have your own particular challenge

356
00:27:00,097 --> 00:27:02,620
here at this school given who you are.

357
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:14,500
Your father struggled, too.

358
00:27:17,187 --> 00:27:19,892
He had difficulties of a different kind.

359
00:27:19,904 --> 00:27:22,145
Great difficulties, great pain.

360
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:28,871
But he never gave up, and then,
with help, he prevailed.

361
00:27:34,955 --> 00:27:37,675
I think I would still like
to do the Challenge, sir.

362
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:42,035
I think my father expects it.

363
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,020
Move!

364
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,540
- Come on, boys! Let's go!
- Give me a hand up!

365
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,620
- Come on!
- Go on!

366
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,500
- Pull up!
- Almost there.

367
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,820
Come on. Help me up!

368
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,100
Get up here!

369
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,420
Did you think I was going to let it go?

370
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,260
- Help me up!
- Philip!

371
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:07,319
- Are you all right, Jim?
- Serves him right!

372
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,684
I don't expect you
to get on with everyone.

373
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,983
What I do expect of all my pupils is

374
00:28:12,995 --> 00:28:15,049
to conform with Platonic ideals...

375
00:28:15,074 --> 00:28:18,918
to argue without quarreling,
to quarrel without suspecting,

376
00:28:18,949 --> 00:28:22,460
- to suspect without slandering.
- Sir...

377
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:25,220
You and James will have
extra building duties.

378
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,852
You can work on the main gate together.

379
00:28:26,877 --> 00:28:27,924
Look, in my defense...

380
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:34,820
I think we've all seen how you act
in your defense.

381
00:28:39,898 --> 00:28:41,218
Thank you.

382
00:28:45,666 --> 00:28:47,313
...and as a punishment we have to

383
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:49,285
build a gate together over half-term,

384
00:28:49,515 --> 00:28:52,955
- instead of coming to see you.
- Dr. Hahn telephoned me yesterday.

385
00:28:53,199 --> 00:28:55,460
He's going to keep you
at school over the holidays,

386
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:58,112
to help you settle. I'm afraid I agreed.

387
00:28:58,137 --> 00:29:00,420
- Are you going to be long?
- Piss off! You did what?

388
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,580
Which leaves me obliged
to fly to the wedding.

389
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,900
But that's in London.

390
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:06,012
Yes. We're at the airfield now.

391
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,060
Sorry, but I've got to go.

392
00:29:11,326 --> 00:29:14,286
Now you just settle and behave well.
That'll cheer me up.

393
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,180
Oi!

394
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,180
Prick!

395
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,957
Yeah.

396
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,140
Philip!

397
00:30:42,426 --> 00:30:43,420
Philip!

398
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,460
Hahn wants you!

399
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,020
Hurry up!

400
00:30:55,809 --> 00:30:57,395
After takeoff from Cologne,

401
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:01,180
bad weather meant
they couldn't land at Brussels.

402
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:07,039
While attempting to land in Ostend...

403
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:12,918
I'm afraid...

404
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:20,570
I'm afraid all 12 souls were lost.

405
00:31:27,263 --> 00:31:28,383
Twelve.

406
00:31:33,833 --> 00:31:35,426
Including the four crew.

407
00:31:39,324 --> 00:31:42,720
But with four crew, plus Cecile, Don,

408
00:31:42,732 --> 00:31:46,140
Ludwig and Alexander, that's eight.

409
00:31:47,009 --> 00:31:48,889
Also the Grand Duke's mother,

410
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:54,980
a nurse, Joachim Freiherr von Riedesel.

411
00:31:59,776 --> 00:32:00,816
Eleven.

412
00:32:04,098 --> 00:32:07,380
And your sister Cecile must have gone
into labor

413
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,900
on the flight.

414
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,949
A newborn was found in the wreckage.

415
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:39,763
Arrangements...

416
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,414
Where is he?

417
00:35:54,781 --> 00:35:56,980
- Philip!
- Philip, where are you?

418
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,523
Philip!

419
00:35:59,335 --> 00:36:01,615
- Come on, Philip!
- Philip!

420
00:36:02,015 --> 00:36:04,100
Philip! Come on!

421
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:06,100
- Philip!
- Philip!

422
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,851
Philip!

423
00:36:09,812 --> 00:36:12,023
- Philip!
- Philip!

424
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:15,476
- Over here! Dr. Hahn!
- He's in the lake!

425
00:36:15,536 --> 00:36:17,757
Come on!

426
00:36:26,073 --> 00:36:27,073
Sir!

427
00:36:40,401 --> 00:36:41,561
Go home!

428
00:36:43,674 --> 00:36:44,961
Back to the school!

429
00:36:46,197 --> 00:36:47,317
Give me the lantern.

430
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:49,437
You too.

431
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:55,620
The milk train will leave
Inverness station

432
00:36:55,645 --> 00:36:57,325
at 4:45 tomorrow morning.

433
00:36:58,914 --> 00:37:00,434
You will be on it.

434
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,728
From London, you will fly to Berlin and

435
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:07,020
then on to Darmstadt with your uncle,

436
00:37:07,484 --> 00:37:11,820
to attend the funeral
of your brother-in-law,

437
00:37:12,716 --> 00:37:16,593
your nephews and your sister.

438
00:37:18,409 --> 00:37:19,961
It will not be easy.

439
00:37:21,034 --> 00:37:24,984
But when you return,
we will be your family.

440
00:37:25,978 --> 00:37:28,445
This school will be your home.

441
00:37:30,816 --> 00:37:32,136
Now come!

442
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:34,784
Be strong!

443
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:37,860
Philip!

444
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,260
Philip.

445
00:40:24,974 --> 00:40:26,014
Philip.

446
00:40:30,982 --> 00:40:31,982
Go on.

447
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:34,820
Go on.

448
00:40:58,374 --> 00:40:59,484
Philip, come.

449
00:41:12,769 --> 00:41:14,969
Mama. It's Philip.

450
00:41:21,705 --> 00:41:22,745
Your son.

451
00:41:26,507 --> 00:41:28,421
I'm surprised he dare show himself here.

452
00:41:28,601 --> 00:41:29,648
Papa!

453
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:33,945
Had it not been for Philip
and his indiscipline...

454
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:38,641
she would never have taken that flight.

455
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:40,880
It's true.

456
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,100
Isn't it, boy?

457
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:51,187
You're the reason we're all here
burying my favorite child.

458
00:41:53,626 --> 00:41:55,666
- Papa.
- Get him out of here.

459
00:42:06,451 --> 00:42:08,811
You may hate him now,

460
00:42:10,226 --> 00:42:13,826
but one day, God willing,
you will be a father yourself.

461
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:18,220
And you will fall short,
as all parents do.

462
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,890
And be hated.

463
00:42:23,792 --> 00:42:25,688
And you will know what it is to pray

464
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,820
for the forgiveness from your own son.

465
00:42:56,664 --> 00:42:59,148
Philip. Where are you going?

466
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:47,100
Get inside.

467
00:44:08,609 --> 00:44:10,209
I think he needs help, sir.

468
00:44:11,362 --> 00:44:14,522
Not until he's asked for it. Come.

469
00:44:33,186 --> 00:44:35,066
- Sir?
- Move on!

470
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:34,300
He's here.

471
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:45,730
Help.

472
00:45:55,279 --> 00:45:56,479
Speak up.

473
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:04,895
I... I need help.

474
00:46:18,423 --> 00:46:19,823
So...

475
00:46:22,912 --> 00:46:23,952
Now we go.

476
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:45,500
Boys.

477
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:46,820
Come on, boys.

478
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:48,820
- Three, two...
- Hands on.

479
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:50,140
- One.
- Lift up!

480
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:54,012
- Steady.
- Careful.

481
00:46:54,434 --> 00:46:56,314
Stop. Pull back. Back.

482
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,325
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

483
00:47:13,505 --> 00:47:16,129
Good. Well done, boys.

484
00:47:25,986 --> 00:47:27,186
You too, Philip.

485
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:28,260
The challenge ahead is one
that faces every Gordonstounian.

486
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:31,580
Your route is 18-miles long.

487
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:32,780
Torch.

488
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:34,220
You are Gordonstounians,

489
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:37,856
and you are expected
to rise to the challenge.

490
00:48:38,591 --> 00:48:42,622
Plus est en vous, gentlemen.
There is more in each of you.

491
00:48:42,647 --> 00:48:43,950
Plus est en vous.

492
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:50,180
Hurry up!

493
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,060
- Go on!
- What?

494
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:53,020
Go on!

495
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:55,820
Get a move on, Charlie! Hurry up!

496
00:48:56,095 --> 00:48:56,744
Charles!

497
00:48:56,756 --> 00:48:58,575
Catch them up! Quick! Go on!

498
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:06,940
- Hurry up!
- Hurry up!

499
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:13,942
Hurry up!

500
00:49:19,838 --> 00:49:22,758
Just leave it. Keep going.

501
00:49:35,934 --> 00:49:38,215
Hello, sir! It's good to have you back!

502
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,590
It's my absolute pleasure.

503
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:41,180
How's he doing?

504
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:44,900
Well... they should all
be back at two o'clock.

505
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:03,380
- Grater. Hadden. Cann.
- Sorry, sir.

506
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:07,260
Never mind. And Pickering. Griffiths.

507
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:09,580
- Is Charles here?
- Let me have a look.

508
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:14,129
- Where's Charles?
- We lost him, quite early on.

509
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:18,460
Geddes. Right, everyone,
get changed quick as you can!

510
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:27,780
Thank you.

511
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:40,740
Mr. Peacock, the head of our studies.

512
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:42,780
How do you do? Good to see you.

513
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:00,740
Ah!

514
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:03,660
And finally, Team B.

515
00:51:17,729 --> 00:51:20,511
Well, I think we should start
the presentation.

516
00:51:23,138 --> 00:51:24,223
Ten more minutes.

517
00:51:26,232 --> 00:51:27,278
Of course.

518
00:51:39,969 --> 00:51:41,049
Charles?

519
00:52:07,705 --> 00:52:08,905
Charles?

520
00:52:15,074 --> 00:52:16,317
Charles?

521
00:52:20,667 --> 00:52:22,535
Right! That's it. Let's begin.

522
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:28,340
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you very much!

523
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:31,100
Well, it's a great joy to be here

524
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:36,020
and a great pleasure to see
so many happy, healthy, handsome faces.

525
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:39,140
The Annual Challenge is a unique test.

526
00:52:39,528 --> 00:52:41,811
In completing it, all participants will

527
00:52:41,823 --> 00:52:44,060
have shown great character, stamina,

528
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:45,629
and most of all...

529
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:51,340
It's him. Where's he been?

530
00:52:56,128 --> 00:52:58,817
...and most of all, courage.

531
00:53:13,515 --> 00:53:15,475
The ethos at Gordonstoun

532
00:53:16,584 --> 00:53:21,325
is to embrace the community
over the individual,

533
00:53:22,268 --> 00:53:25,068
the team over the star.

534
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:29,620
And so it gives me great pleasure
to present this wonderful trophy,

535
00:53:29,645 --> 00:53:32,820
the Duke of Edinburgh Cup,
to the winning team,

536
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:36,020
which I believe is Team C.

537
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:37,580
Led by Simon Harper.

538
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:43,780
Well, don't just sit there, boy!
Come and collect it!

539
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:47,340
Congratulations. Good work.

540
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:49,620
Well done! Good lad! Well done!

541
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:21,020
I want you to know,
if you're feeling bad

542
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:23,380
about where you finished
in that challenge today...

543
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:26,420
it's of no consequence to me.

544
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:31,170
I understand that these
sorts of physical

545
00:54:31,182 --> 00:54:32,684
tests don't come naturally to you.

546
00:54:32,723 --> 00:54:34,497
But you showed great courage

547
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:37,300
and determination.

548
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:40,660
Don't worry about it.

549
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:46,060
Whatever shame you may or may not
be feeling, I can assure you

550
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:49,340
it's nothing compared to the
shame I felt at your age,

551
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:51,980
over something I did.

552
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:57,140
- To my favorite sister.
- Oh!

553
00:54:57,220 --> 00:55:01,820
Cecile. She hated flying.

554
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:03,380
Loathed it, terrified of it.

555
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:08,020
She always dressed in black
when she flew, for her own funeral.

556
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:10,677
Anyway, the point is that Kurt Hahn

557
00:55:10,689 --> 00:55:12,460
and that school put me back together,

558
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:14,100
toughened me up. Charles...

559
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:15,860
The pain...

560
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:18,420
The struggle is a gift, Charles.

561
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,140
This is the moment you have to dig deep.

562
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:22,820
You put the work in now
and you won't struggle in the future.

563
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:25,700
But you've got to toughen up a little,
boy, for what is ahead of you.

564
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:29,020
Don't worry about it! It's just air!

565
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:32,567
I know there's more in you, Charles.

566
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:36,380
You've got to be strong,
and you've got to find it.

567
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:37,860
It's just air!

568
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:43,260
- Get him back here!
- Don't be so weak!

569
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,653
Don't be so bloody weak!

570
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:49,260
Charles, it's all right.

571
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:51,660
- Out! Get out!
- Charles!

572
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:55,020
It's all right.

573
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:14,090
Winds are picking up...

574
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:30,620
Daddy!

575
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,294
Daddy!

576
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,220
Daddy!

577
00:56:35,736 --> 00:56:37,736
Darling Anne!
How's my favorite little girl?

578
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:59,740
- Faster, Daddy!
- I'm coming, I'm coming!

579
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:16,860
Thank you.

580
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:20,620
You must be hungry.
Like me to make you a sandwich?

581
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:22,980
Yes, please. Hello, Martin!
