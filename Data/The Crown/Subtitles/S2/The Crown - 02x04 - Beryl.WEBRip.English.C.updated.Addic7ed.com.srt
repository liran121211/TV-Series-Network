1
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,560
 We are gathered together here
in the sight of God

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,920
and in the face of this congregation

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,520
to join together this man and this woman
in holy matrimony.

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,440
 Instituted of God
in the time of man's innocency,

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,200
signifying unto us

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,320
the mystical union
that is betwixt Christ and his Church.

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,080
Therefore, it is not by any
to be enterprised,

8
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,600
nor taken in hand, unadvisedly,
lightly or wantonly,

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,080
to satisfy men's carnal lusts
and appetites,

10
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,080
like brute beasts
that understand nothing.

11
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,480
But reverently, discreetly, advisedly,

12
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,360
soberly and in the fear of God.

13
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,280
Duly considering the causes
for which matrimony was ordained.

14
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,760
That's absolutely charming.
Thank you very much.

15
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,600
Very, very fresh.
Full of vitality, thank you.

16
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,320
And we're going to do another one
when we're ready, and...

17
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,680
Colin, chin down a little bit.
Very much down a little bit.

18
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,160
Thank you. To me, everyone, and flash.

19
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,920
- The bride and groom!
- The bride and groom.

20
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,160
Bloody awful things, weddings.

21
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,800
- Dreadfully upsetting.
- Unless it's one's own, of course.

22
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,920
Mm.

23
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,080
Another couple off to build a castle.

24
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,200
Lower the portcullis.
Pull up the drawbridge.

25
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,480
- What? How do you mean?
- Couples do that, don't they?

26
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,280
They turn to each other,
and all we see is their backs.

27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,680
So, what am I to do, Billy?

28
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,160
No one wants to take me on, apparently.

29
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,080
I'm too daunting a prospect.

30
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,840
I could give it a go.

31
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,760
Don't be silly, you're a friend.

32
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,160
Yes, but isn't that the first quality
one should look for in a husband?

33
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,880
In the olden days,
people weren't confused.

34
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,680
People married for sensible reasons.
Marriage was a consolidation of assets.

35
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,240
Also of other things.

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,400
Of friendship and values.

37
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,400
Outlooks.

38
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,560
We'd breed derby winners,
have an army of children...

39
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,760
- Billy...
- Look, and I'd know the ropes.

40
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,080
I know the rules. Your family all know
me, and I think are not averse.

41
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,960
- Oh, they adore you.
- And I you.

42
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,903
Always have.

43
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm your Old Faithful, after all.

44
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,080
 Mummy said something
interesting the other day.

45
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,000
Oh?

46
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,480
She said that the first ten years
of marriage are just an overture.

47
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,663
That there's often a crisis at ten years,

48
00:04:28,688 --> 00:04:30,944
but then you work it out and settle in...

49
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,560
and it's only then
that it really gets into its stride.

50
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,760
Oh.

51
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,640
Do you suppose
that's what's happened to us?

52
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,000
Possibly.

53
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,840
I was thinking, perhaps we should have

54
00:04:52,865 --> 00:04:55,344
a big anniversary party this year.

55
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,920
To celebrate hitting our stride.

56
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,200
All right.

57
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,680
Yes?

58
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,720
All right. It's Margaret.

59
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,120
 So how was it?

60
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,040
It somehow managed to lift the spirits

61
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,760
and make one want to kill oneself
in equal measure.

62
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,040
Took forever to get there.

63
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,240
- Mummy was a nightmare.
- Was she?

64
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,800
Mercifully, they sent a helicopter
to bring us back.

65
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,720
Hmm.

66
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,367
And I have this horrible
feeling that somewhere,

67
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,264
in the middle of it all...

68
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,094
I agreed to get married myself.

69
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:50,024
What?

70
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,080
- To whom?
- Billy Wallace.

71
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,960
Goodness!

72
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,120
Congratulations! Billy Wallace.

73
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,960
Oh, Christ!

74
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:10,880
So if I were to accept,
it would be a yes from you?

75
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,600
Yes, of course.

76
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,120
An emphatic yes.

77
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,280
And Philip and I
were just discussing having a party

78
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,280
for our tenth wedding anniversary,

79
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,000
and you and Billy could use the occasion
to announce your engagement,

80
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,120
if you wanted.

81
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,920
That's a nice idea.

82
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,520
Well, that's settled then.

83
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,520
- Thank you.
- My pleasure. Goodnight, Margaret.

85
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
...perhaps you'd explain why it is

86
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,480
that the satellite
keeps on circling the Earth

87
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,440
instead of either flying off into space
or dropping to the ground.

88
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,800
I'm not sure how I feel about
a Russian satellite circling the Earth...

89
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,120
just above our heads.
What's it doing up there?

90
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,440
Notionally, it's providing information

91
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,920
about the density
of the Earth's upper atmosphere.

92
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,240
Of course its darker purpose
is to demonstrate to everyone

93
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,440
the extent of Russian military power

94
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,240
- and technical capacity.
- Oh.

95
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,800
The same rocket
that launched this satellite

96
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,040
is capable of firing a nuclear warhead

97
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,320
into enemy territory
with pinpoint accuracy.

98
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,335
- Wow.
- Imagine the effect

99
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,680
this will have on the Americans.

100
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,240
A great crisis of self-doubt,
if I'm not very much mistaken.

101
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,440
We must seize this opportunity
to help the Americans

102
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,440
and work together in a joint effort
to meet the Russian threat.

103
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:05,280
That is the way to repair Anglo-American
relations, which, as you know,

104
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,520
have deteriorated terribly
due to the Suez Crisis.

105
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,880
Quite. You know,
after the war they said Eisen...

106
00:09:13,905 --> 00:09:17,680
I am absolutely determined
to restore the special relationship

107
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,480
that exists between our two countries.

108
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:24,440
We're bound by so much more
than just language and shared history.

109
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,120
It's a kind of marriage.

110
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,815
As in any marriage,
there'll be ups and downs,

111
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,600
but one must work
to get things back on track.

112
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,533
They say that listening's important.

113
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,000
In any marriage.

114
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,800
 Does that mean
that we can learn just as much

115
00:09:45,825 --> 00:09:47,465
from this satellite as the Russians?

116
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,240
And how are we going to do this?

117
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,680
I think the driver should drop me first,
then take you on to the station.

118
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,120
Or I could wait.

119
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,920
I don't think that would be wise.

120
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,680
Why? How long do you need with him?

121
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,160
A day. Maybe two.

122
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,120
It's the last time, I promise.

123
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,120
- Don't make promises you cannot keep.
- No.

124
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,646
I'm determined to end it. It's time.

125
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,800
- Now that you're Prime Minister.
- Yes, it is.

126
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,480
With a one, two, three, flash.

127
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,360
Oh, quite magnificent.

128
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,360
Why does it always have to be
Cecil Beaton

129
00:11:15,385 --> 00:11:18,360
- taking my official birthday portrait?
- What's wrong with Cecil?

130
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,280
When it came out last year,
everyone said how pretty you looked.

131
00:11:22,305 --> 00:11:24,585
No, they said how much I looked like you.

132
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,240
Well, quite.

133
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,440
Fairy tales.

134
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,800
Yes, but he does it so well.

135
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,920
And to me, Your Royal Highness.

136
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,080
A little less chin, and..

137
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,640
What do you think?

138
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,360
I asked my new lady-in-waiting
here today...

139
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,440
Your Majesty.

140
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,200
...to offer her opinion...

141
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,920
having at least one foot
in the real world.

142
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,240
I think birthday portraits
should evolve and mature with age.

143
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,840
Like the subject. Show change
in the character. Complexity.

144
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,623
Reality.

145
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,120
No one wants complexity
and reality from us.

146
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,160
Do sit down.

147
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,920
People have enough of that
in their own lives.

148
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,480
- They want us to help them escape.
- Indeed, Your Majesty.

149
00:12:17,966 --> 00:12:19,886
Imagine this, if you will...

150
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,680
a young woman, a commonplace creature.
She sits in her drab little scullery.

151
00:12:26,133 --> 00:12:29,453
So much work to do. So much washing-up.

152
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,320
How she longs for comfort, for hope.

153
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,040
And again. One, two, three and flash.

154
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:42,000
She wants to believe
her life has some meaning beyond chores.

155
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:46,600
She opens a magazine and she sees
Her Royal Highness's photograph.

156
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:53,160
For one glorious, transforming moment,
she becomes a princess, too.

157
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:58,440
She is lifted out of her miserable,
pitiful reality into a fantasy.

158
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,840
Later, she will step out of her house

159
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:11,120
in a new neckerchief, perhaps,
for which she has saved.

160
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,160
Oh, she will hold her head up high.
She is renewed.

161
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,520
And all thanks to you,
Your Royal Highness...

162
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,200
and to the ideal which you represent.

163
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,440
And now,
with a one, two, three and flash.

164
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,520
Quite marvelous.

165
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,560
It's good news all round.

166
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,960
In the 20 or so years we have known
the hapless, misshapen crane

167
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,920
that is Billy Wallace, has any woman ever

168
00:13:55,945 --> 00:13:58,024
looked at him as an object of desire?

169
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,280
I mean, even remotely?

170
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,800
Certainly not.

171
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,340
Then how can one begin to explain that?

172
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,760
Ma'am, Lord Blandford
just telephoned to apologize

173
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,480
and say that Mr. Wallace
may be indisposed this evening.

174
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,520
He can't be indisposed.
We're announcing our engagement.

175
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,800
Something about an injury.
Rather a serious injury.

176
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,680
- Where is he?
- Your Highness.

177
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,520
Uh...

178
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,200
Her Royal Highness, Princess Margaret.

179
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,320
- Out of my way.
- Oh, shit.

180
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,120
No, you must keep your leg up, sir.

181
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,103
Billy?

182
00:15:14,932 --> 00:15:16,132
It's all right, Simpson.

183
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,800
Well, what's going on?
It's our announcement this evening.

184
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,528
Unforeseen circs, I'm afraid.

185
00:15:31,553 --> 00:15:33,787
Rather a dust-up in the early hours.

186
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,040
Are you drunk?

187
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,280
Don't be like that.
I had to do something for the pain.

188
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,920
- Well, what happened?
- Wait till you hear.

189
00:15:42,406 --> 00:15:43,806
You'll laugh till you spit.

190
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,960
Your friend Tennant rather took offense
at something I did.

191
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,720
You came to blows with Colin?

192
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,880
I believe the word "duel" was mentioned.

193
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,680
A duel?

194
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,120
 Tennant issued the challenge.

195
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,360
A little childish in this day and age
if you ask me,

196
00:15:58,385 --> 00:16:00,505
but a duel is a duel,
so I stepped up to the mark.

197
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,560
That's what a gentleman does.

198
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,080
No!

199
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,670
If I'm completely honest,

200
00:16:11,695 --> 00:16:14,224
a little drink had
been taken during the night.

201
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,760
But we faced the dawn
with clear heads and strong hearts.

202
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,650
Now, Tennant wanted to motor up to Glen

203
00:16:22,675 --> 00:16:24,584
to get his father's old pistols.

204
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,920
It would've been quite ridiculous.
Much too far away.

205
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,400
So, Blandford offered his.

206
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,280
It was a bloody stupid mistake.

207
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,240
A duel is not just
a test of marksmanship.

208
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,200
It's a test of character.

209
00:16:38,292 --> 00:16:39,532
Ten paces.

210
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,320
One... two...

211
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,940
three... four...

212
00:16:46,913 --> 00:16:49,313
five... six...

213
00:16:50,012 --> 00:16:54,692
seven... eight... nine...

214
00:16:54,717 --> 00:16:55,637
ten.

215
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,160
Fucker shot me in the leg.
Bloody awful thing.

216
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,280
Anyway, I survived
with a small flesh wound.

217
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,320
And why was he angry with you?

218
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,755
It's the strangest thing,

219
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,944
but ever since word got
out about our engagement,

220
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,840
I've found myself
quite the center of attention.

221
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,400
It's as though
every good-looking girl on Earth

222
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,040
has taken the news
as a personal challenge.

223
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,640
I'm not used to the idea of being a beau,
much less a catch.

224
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,560
Seems to have gone to my head rather.

225
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,160
Had a bit of a fumble at Blenheim.

226
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,760
She was rather a beauty.
She's in pictures, you know. An actress.

227
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,160
Anyway, Tennant got wind of it
and got very cross.

228
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,920
Yes, with reason.

229
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,600
You pathetic, weak, contemptible fool.

230
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,288
I never even wanted to marry you.

231
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:02,664
You were only ever an act of charity.

232
00:18:03,106 --> 00:18:04,306
Or desperation.

233
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,000
And now you insult me? You?

234
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,637
People like you don't
get to insult people like me.

235
00:18:10,662 --> 00:18:12,184
You get to be eternally grateful.

236
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,800
You've quite the way with women.

237
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,409
Take a look at this face.

238
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:24,184
A picture of disappointment and disgust.

239
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,280
This is the look that every woman
you ever know will come to share.

240
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,760
This is what the next 40 years
of your life will look like.

241
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,560
Margaret...

242
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,400
Margaret!

243
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,120
Shit!

244
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,680
Ma'am, I've been asked to tell you

245
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,863
that Princess Margaret
will not be announcing

246
00:19:03,888 --> 00:19:05,584
the engagement this evening.

247
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,680
Her Royal Highness said
she'll explain everything later.

248
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,480
Yes, I'm sure she will.
Thank you, Michael.

249
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,560
Thank you, ma'am.

250
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,720
All right, all right, settle down.

251
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,056
So on my recent tour of the Pacific,

252
00:19:38,081 --> 00:19:40,784
I was introduced to a man who said to me,

253
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,440
"My wife is a doctor of philosophy
and much more important than I am."

254
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,720
To which I could only reply,

255
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,160
"Ah, yes, sir, we have that trouble
in our family too."

256
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,480
You know, when I imagined our marriage
in the early days,

257
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,328
I imagined two people

258
00:20:01,353 --> 00:20:04,944
welded together into some sort
of combined existence.

259
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:13,120
Ten years. Ten years has taught me
the secret of a successful marriage

260
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,680
is actually to have different interests.

261
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,640
Well, different interests,
but not entirely different.

262
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,560
It's a funny business.

263
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,240
One sees the whole of the other person,
you see even that part of them

264
00:20:31,265 --> 00:20:32,905
that they don't see themselves,

265
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:36,983
and presumably...
they see that hidden part of you.

266
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,753
One ends up knowing more
about one's partner

267
00:20:42,203 --> 00:20:44,024
than they know about themselves.

268
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,587
And it can be pretty tough

269
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:49,384
to keep quiet about it. So you have to...

270
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,040
You have to come to an accommodation,

271
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,243
an arrangement, a deal...

272
00:20:56,533 --> 00:20:58,745
if you like, to take
the rough with the smooth.

273
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,520
But the extraordinary thing is...

274
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,560
down there in the rough...

275
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,680
in the long reeds of difficulty
and pain...

276
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,440
that is where you find the treasure.

277
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,520
So I would like to propose a toast...

278
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,000
in the name of love.

279
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,400
In the name of our beloved country.

280
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,200
In the name of steadfastness.

281
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,560
In the name
of another ten marvelous years.

282
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,040
I give you mon petit chou...

283
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,440
Lilibet...

284
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,880
Elizabeth...

285
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,240
the Queen.

286
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,640
The Queen!

287
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,800
 We're sending you
to the newsroom at Alexandra Palace.

288
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,880
President Eisenhower has spoken warmly
of the special relationship

289
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,560
that exists between Britain
and the United States.

290
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,993
 Prime Minister Macmillan and I will

291
00:25:04,018 --> 00:25:05,664
do everything we can

292
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:11,680
to strengthen and repair the long-term
bonds which have bound together the...

293
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,200
But I can't. I can't.

294
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,320
I want only you.

295
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:26,400
I've tried again with Harold.
Tried and tried.

296
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,160
I know, I know.

297
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:34,080
I just can't.
I can't have him touch me, be near me.

298
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,720
His weakness repels me.

299
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:42,920
His love disgusts me.

300
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,960
Good morning!

301
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,520
Oh, darling, what a mess.

302
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:11,280
It is the most beautiful day.

303
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,120
I've brought something to cheer you up.

304
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,640
Cecil's magnificent work.

305
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,480
He's quite outdone himself this time.

306
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,220
I can tell you which one I would choose

307
00:26:26,245 --> 00:26:28,344
as the official birthday portrait,

308
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,280
and Cecil immediately agreed.

309
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,840
But of course, it's for you to decide.

310
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,920
And with regards to Billy Wallace...

311
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,880
Don't mention that name.

312
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,240
I've had him
on the telephone to me all morning,

313
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,680
quite distraught.

314
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,267
Then his mother, then his grandmother...

315
00:27:16,292 --> 00:27:18,264
I'm never speaking to him again.

316
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,440
Then we will find you someone else.

317
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,480
I don't want you to find me anyone.

318
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,560
Maurice Landgrave of Hesse.

319
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,720
He's a distant cousin.

320
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,680
Now his mother was a Catholic,
but their lands are still intact,

321
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,480
and he gives a very good show of himself
on the polo field...

322
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,600
No one!

323
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:42,400
Someone suggested
Prince Christian of Hanover,

324
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,480
a descendant of Queen Victoria.

325
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,560
Served in the Luftwaffe,
but we won't hold that against him.

326
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,120
I do know what the official duties
of a lady-in-waiting are.

327
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,520
Accompanying me on foreign trips,
dealing with my mail.

328
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,000
Do you suppose it might also include
helping me climb over the wall to escape?

329
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,680
I just can't bear it anymore.

330
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,520
I'm having some people
to dinner, tonight.

331
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,040
What, normal people?

332
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,160
 Yes, they're all normal.

333
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,960
But in their own way,
they're all quite exceptional, too.

334
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,320
You can go.

335
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,920
And possibly not deferential.

336
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,340
 That's fine.

337
00:28:22,365 --> 00:28:24,824
As long as they still meet the main
requirements.

338
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,280
Which are?

339
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,165
That none of them breeds
horses, owns land...

340
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:33,664
or knows my mother.

341
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,000
All right, all of you.

342
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,280
Hello.

343
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,360
Everyone.

344
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,680
I'd like you to say hello
to our guest of honor,

345
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,520
Her Royal Highness,
the Princess Margaret.

346
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,520
Hello.

347
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,880
Are you ready, ma'am?
Here come the introductions.

348
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,560
Here we have Dudley on the piano.

349
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,080
And this here is Shilpa.

350
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,146
Feeling a little left out...

351
00:30:02,283 --> 00:30:05,464
and you're thinking to yourself,

352
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,280
"These dabblers and freaks
seem to know one another very well."

353
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,280
Hmm?

354
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,480
Then you'd be absolutely right.

355
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,200
Now, be honest.

356
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,600
Can you remember any of the names?

357
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,600
No, not really.

358
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,240
Can't remember me either?

359
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,000
What, we've met?

360
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,040
We have.

361
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,120
Where have we met?

362
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,000
Perhaps it'll come to you.

363
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,360
Now, where to begin...

364
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,040
Ah. Far corner.

365
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,600
The irresistible so-and-so
with the mustard-colored polo neck.

366
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:50,760
- Irresistible?
- Oh, come on, a nine, surely?

367
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,880
Seven.

368
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,760
He's called Jeremy,
he's heir to a chocolate fortune.

369
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,080
Married to the blonde beauty opposite.

370
00:30:59,007 --> 00:31:01,247
- Oh, she's an eight.
- Isn't she?

371
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,080
Yes, they dazzle in public, those two.

372
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:09,160
They don't disappoint in private either.
More of that another time, I think.

373
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,360
Who's next?

374
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:14,120
Ah, yes.
Our flushed and fleshy friend in paisley.

375
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,480
His name's Ken Russell,
makes documentaries for the BBC.

376
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,320
Travels everywhere on a bus.

377
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,640
You've probably never been on a bus,
have you?

378
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,560
- No.
- Pity.

379
00:31:30,007 --> 00:31:31,447
You really do meet the best people.

380
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:38,480
Tell me about the woman
with the... extraordinary eyes.

381
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,200
Baroness Frankenstein.

382
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,280
She played opposite Boris Karloff
in that movie, you know. Actress.

383
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,840
- Oh.
- No one can quite make out

384
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,200
why she left
a rather brilliant film producer

385
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,000
for a dreary politician.

386
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,600
- Oh.
- His name's John Profumo.

387
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,800
Fucking dull.

388
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,280
It's true, it's true. But...

389
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,720
The older gentleman beside him...

390
00:32:04,745 --> 00:32:06,336
Oh, no, no, no. I know who that one is.

391
00:32:06,361 --> 00:32:07,889
That's John Betjeman, the poet.

392
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,480
Um...

393
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:15,600
"Books from Boots' and country lanes,
Free speech, free passes...

394
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,360
Class distinction.

395
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,800
Distinction.

396
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,520
- Democracy...
- Democracy...

397
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,280
and proper drains."

398
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,520
Just so.

399
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,880
Is it really true he has two wives?

400
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,560
I hope so.

401
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,920
Better if he has three.

402
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,880
We don't want
anyone conventional around here.

403
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,080
Now, tell me about you.

404
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,280
- Oh, God, you really don't remember.
- No.

405
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,520
Hm. I'm a photographer.

406
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,920
Oh, the wedding photographer?

407
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,440
Ah, that was a favor.
That's not my normal line of work.

408
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,360
What is?

409
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,440
This.

410
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:10,880
Ah.

411
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,960
- What, these are yours?
- Yes.

412
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,200
Portraits?

413
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:20,200
Mm, I don't like that word.
It's so stuffy and traditional.

414
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:23,200
Oh, sorry. What are they, then?

415
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,006
Mm, people, faces.

416
00:33:26,031 --> 00:33:28,944
They're the most interesting
subject I've found so far.

417
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,840
If you can think of anything
more interesting, do let me know.

418
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,040
Oh, I like them.

419
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:42,680
It's as if there's no camera at all.
You've caught them off guard.

420
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:46,760
- Ah, it's all luck, really.
- You've made the ugliness beautiful.

421
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,360
I despise posturing
and pretentiousness and humbug.

422
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,760
Don't you?

423
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,920
Is that why you took up photography?

424
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:58,960
Maybe.

425
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,760
Maybe it's just a good way
to get behind closed doors.

426
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,549
Somebody's door in particular?

427
00:34:04,574 --> 00:34:05,944
Just doors generally.

428
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,400
A facade is only useful as a marker

429
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,640
for something one has to get behind
or beyond.

430
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,902
The surface is so dreary,
don't you think?

431
00:34:12,927 --> 00:34:14,624
What people want to show of themselves,

432
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:17,080
the idealized version,
is of no interest to me.

433
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:21,960
What people hide... that interests me.

434
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,560
But you get so close.

435
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,640
Isn't it rather an intrusion?

436
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,000
It's very much an intrusion, yes.
That's exactly what photography is.

437
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,360
I use a small Leica, nothing fancy,

438
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,400
and natural light,
which means that I can prowl around.

439
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,320
All the while
I'm getting closer and closer,

440
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,960
and in the end, it's kind of like...

441
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,080
- Well, it's, uh...
- Intrusion.

442
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,560
Intimacy.

443
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,680
How would you feel
about taking my photograph?

444
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,040
Well, I'd consider it.

445
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,640
On one condition.

446
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,760
- Go on.
- When you come to my slum studio,

447
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,320
you leave the titles
and princess outside.

448
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,400
- I'd be happy to.
- And for the duration of the session,

449
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,800
you do everything I say.

450
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,160
Don't look like that.

451
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,920
You're dying to, admit it.

452
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,080
Dying to what?

453
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,400
Be a supplicant.

454
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,560
I can tell.

455
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,600
 It was the first room
I've ever been to where nobody got up,

456
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,920
bowed, curtsied.

457
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,034
Some just carried
on having conversations,

458
00:35:59,059 --> 00:36:00,424
as if I wasn't there at all.

459
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,200
Those that did talk to me
did with such indifference

460
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:09,600
or nonchalance, it
verged on impertinence.

461
00:36:10,279 --> 00:36:12,303
There was this one in particular.

462
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,920
- Tony.
- Anthony, surely?

463
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,360
No, he insisted.

464
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:20,720
Tony. Armstrong-Jones.
He's this photographer.

465
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,400
- Like Cecil?
- Oh, no, nothing like Cecil.

466
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,040
Couldn't be less like Cecil.

467
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,040
Well, maybe a bit like Cecil,
in that he's obviously queer.

468
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,960
Though interestingly,
Elizabeth denies it.

469
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,200
Elizabeth who?

470
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,727
Cavendish.

471
00:36:33,752 --> 00:36:36,144
I called her when I got home
last night and interrogated her.

472
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,013
"What are the five most important things

473
00:36:38,038 --> 00:36:39,704
I need to know about that man?"

474
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,856
Why five?

475
00:36:40,881 --> 00:36:42,904
I don't know. Felt like the right number.

476
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,440
- Why not three?
- He's more interesting than three.

477
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,880
So, what did she say?

478
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,880
One, that he's Welsh.

479
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,480
- Is that interesting?
- No, not particularly.

480
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,480
That he had polio as a child.

481
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,800
That he has a passion
for inventing things.

482
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,960
And he would never dream of being
anything as straightforward

483
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,320
as "simply queer."

484
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,880
What on earth does that mean?

485
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,760
I'm not altogether sure.

486
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:12,240
But I'm also not incurious to find out.

487
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,000
 What was number five?

488
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:14,960
You can go.

489
00:37:14,985 --> 00:37:15,960
- That was five.

490
00:37:15,985 --> 00:37:17,769
- No,
Margaret, that was four.

491
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,320
 All right. Five is...

492
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,440
I liked him.

493
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,240
Yes, I can tell that.

494
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,920
- There's a contempt in him.
- What for?

495
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,880
For me. For us.

496
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,440
For everything we represent.

497
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,640
I actually think you'd like him.

498
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,000
That's what's so dangerous about him.

499
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,600
Upstairs.

500
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,360
Right.

501
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,600
Wait there.

502
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,520
Back in a minute.

503
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,200
Don't smile like that.

504
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,000
It's lovely, but don't.

505
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,960
Too lovely?

506
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,240
- For my taste, yes.
- Oh, I see.

507
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:25,320
You'd prefer me to be unlovely?

508
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,240
I'd prefer you to be yourself.

509
00:41:28,265 --> 00:41:30,264
Though I realize that's asking the
impossible.

510
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,760
Why?

511
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,720
Because I'm uncooperative?

512
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,280
Because you have no idea who you are.

513
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,840
Look to the window.

514
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,960
- I know perfectly well.
- No, not the faintest idea.

515
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,480
Window.

516
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,840
We don't know who you are, either.

517
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,160
The rest of us, outside the palace gates.

518
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,480
That's because we keep feeding you
the fairy tale.

519
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,640
Like this.

520
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:21,560
Ah.

521
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,120
Jesus.

522
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,760
I'm sorry, but, uh...

523
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,440
Cecil is a disgrace.

524
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,120
Well, he's been good to the family.

525
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,320
Why would you care about the family?

526
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,800
Have they been good to you?

527
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,200
They're my family.

528
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:49,920
Yes.

529
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,320
But that business with Peter Townsend.

530
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,200
Cruel.

531
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,640
Was he really as dreary as he seemed?

532
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,240
He was decent and old-fashioned.

533
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,280
Easy qualities to mock.

534
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,520
Easy to miss, too.

535
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:14,920
Do you miss him?

536
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,080
Sometimes.

537
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:33,320
Got it. Right.
Back to my place for a drink?

538
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:39,880
- Your place? Where's that?
- Well, get dressed and I'll show you.

539
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:03,200
So, this is... home.

540
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,560
Oh, it's marvelous.

541
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:17,520
- Whiskey or Cinzano?
- Whiskey, please.

542
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:27,880
Who's she?

543
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,920
- A friend.
- What kind of friend?

544
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:35,560
A friend.

545
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,920
And this one? Ooh. Couldn't you
have cheered her up a little?

546
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,600
That's Sarah Macmillan,
the Prime Minister's daughter.

547
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,120
Or is she?

548
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,320
Word is not.

549
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,720
- That she's Bob Boothby's love child.
- No.

550
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,680
Mm. Thirty years they say
the affair's been going on,

551
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,720
right under the PM's nose.
Can you imagine?

552
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,720
I don't think I'm ever
going to get married.

553
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:04,080
Quite right.

554
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,560
Ghastly business.

555
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,320
It makes being happy so very difficult.

556
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:17,760
Oh, what's this?

557
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:21,400
Oh, it's something I'm working on.
A design.

558
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,600
It's fragile, get off.

559
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,040
Mm, sorry.

560
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:32,960
Here, come and have a look at this.
This might amuse you.

561
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:43,033
What, people have signed their names?

562
00:46:43,058 --> 00:46:44,624
Well, their nicknames, yes.

563
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:48,160
- Who's Tigger?
- Cleo Laine.

564
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:53,600
- Snitch?
- Dirk Bogarde.

565
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,200
Oh, look. You already have a princess.

566
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,120
Mm.

567
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,560
That's Tony Richardson.

568
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,080
Will you sign?

569
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,320
I keep a diamond for the purpose.

570
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:09,440
Go on.

571
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,480
I'm not sure I've ever had a nickname.

572
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:14,600
What shall I put?

573
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,960
Something that'll
throw them off the scent.

574
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:19,880
Beryl.

575
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,120
- Beryl?
- Mm.

576
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:24,560
All right.

577
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:42,560
It rhymes with peril.

578
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:49,960
Put it back.

579
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:55,200
Right.

580
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:59,680
- Shall we look at the photograph?
- Yes.

581
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:56,680
Right.

582
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:11,760
First...

583
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:15,240
the chemicals.

584
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:29,573
You know, when we first met...

585
00:49:29,598 --> 00:49:30,423
Mm?

586
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,760
...I was sure you were queer.

587
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:42,680
Why?

588
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,960
Just the way you talked to women.

589
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:47,760
Understood women.

590
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,920
Then you put it into the water.

591
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,840
- Here?
- Mm-hmm.

592
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:15,920
Not to mention your tidy little hips,
your vanity and fastidiousness.

593
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,280
I'm not vain.

594
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,960
You're insufferably vain.

595
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:26,840
But now I see you're not queer.

596
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:33,040
Then you put it into the fixer.

597
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:42,440
This whole routine
is far too practiced and well oiled.

598
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:46,720
Woman after woman has been here
before me.

599
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:50,880
Beautiful women.

600
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:52,920
Mm-hmm.

601
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:54,840
Then...

602
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,480
we hang her up.

603
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:15,680
What do you think?

604
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,040
It's a Margaret I've never seen before.

605
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:27,960
- No one's ever seen before.
- No.

606
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,160
Because in this photo,
you're not a princess anymore.

607
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,440
There's someone
I would like you to send it to.

608
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:43,880
Can I give you an address?

609
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:47,160
Sure.

610
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,120
- Then I must go.
- Mm.

611
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:55,680
You, um...

612
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,840
You won't stay a little longer?

613
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:01,560
No.

614
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:03,920
This is where the routine ends.

615
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:07,160
For now.

616
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:09,960
All right.

617
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:12,800
Did you come with a driver?

618
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:15,840
Yes, he's waiting outside.

619
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:17,960
Good. Then he can follow us.

620
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,040
We are most honored to have been guests

621
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:41,600
- in Your Majesty's beautiful home.
- Ah.

622
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:54,320
Hold tight.

623
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,473
Thank you so much for coming.

624
00:53:12,498 --> 00:53:13,704
It's been a pleasure.

625
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,720
Thank you very much.

626
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:21,200
- God, I thought that would never end.
- Yes, it did go on rather.

627
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:25,440
- On and on and on and on.
- Mm.

628
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:55,120
Definitely not queer.

629
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:00,703
Keep it.

630
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:32,800
Night.

631
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:34,200
Goodnight.

632
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:13,440
Good gracious!

633
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:28,000
Oh là là!

634
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:31,843
Mm-mm.

635
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:02,160
- There you are.
- Finally.

636
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,080
- Oh, I say.
- What is it?

637
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:31,280
It appears she's...

638
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:32,200
Naked.

639
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:35,640
Yes.
