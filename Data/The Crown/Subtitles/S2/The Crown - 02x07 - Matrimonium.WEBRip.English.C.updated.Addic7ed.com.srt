1
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,360
Your Royal Highness.

2
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,920
Get out.

3
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,200
Third of August, 1959.

4
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,800
Dearest Margaret,
I write to you with a heavy heart,

5
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,080
in hopes of preparing you...

6
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,600
...for an announcement I am to make.

7
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,653
As you are aware,

8
00:03:03,678 --> 00:03:07,264
I have just returned from a year
abroad around the world.

9
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,160
A young woman named Marie-Luce
accompanied me on this trip

10
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,640
as my secretary and photographer.

11
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,000
She is someone I have known
for a few years now

12
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,240
and her companionship has been
one of the few joys in my life.

13
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,000
I have decided to ask her to marry me.

14
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,160
Dearest Margaret, I know
you will feel betrayed by this decision.

15
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,160
When we parted,
I could never have imagined

16
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,520
falling in love with anyone else.

17
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,800
But these years apart

18
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:43,760
and the knowledge that I will
never be allowed to marry you,

19
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,880
or even, in time...

20

21
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,520
- I, uh...
- Mm?

22
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,760
I received a letter
this morning from Peter Townsend.

23
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,000
Ha! Group Captain Bore?

24
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,840
- Peter's not a bore.
- What?

25
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,800
- I said Peter's not a bore.
- Excuse me.

26
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,313
Straight-backed, obedient, decent.

27
00:05:53,338 --> 00:05:54,904
Missionary fashion, three quick minutes.

28
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,720
And that's your lot. Definitely a bore.
Probably pajamas, too.

29
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,440
He looks like a pajama man.

30
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,160
Striped and ironed.

31
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,280
And? What did he have to say?

32
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,240
He asked my permission to break our pact.

33
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,040
Pact? What pact?

34
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,728
We promised that if we couldn't
marry each other,

35
00:06:16,753 --> 00:06:18,144
we'd never marry anyone else.

36
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,040
Ah, I see.

37
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:26,240
Well... he now wishes to be released
from that pledge.

38
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,920
To get married?

39
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,440
- Yes.
- Who is the unfortunate?

40
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,440
Some girl he met in Brussels.

41
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,800
She's 19.

42
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,280
Really?

43
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,520
At his age?
Isn't that some sort of criminal offense?

44
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,840
Well, he wrote to me so I wouldn't
hear about it from anyone else.

45
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,000
How gallant.

46
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,240
And? How do you feel?

47
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,520
Yes, I feel a bit hurt that he should
have found happiness first.

48
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,160
Ah, don't be.

49
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,840
He hasn't found happiness.

50
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,880
He's found marriage,
the very opposite of happiness.

51
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,300
Ideally it would've been me
writing to him saying

52
00:07:10,325 --> 00:07:13,064
that I was the one getting married.

53
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,240
Uh-uh-uh. You said
you didn't want to get married.

54
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,360
"That's what dreary
conventional people do."

55
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:24,040
You don't think you and I could do it...
unconventionally?

56
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,400
Interestingly?

57
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,960
Christ. Only if we violated
each and every one of the god-awful vows

58
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,760
the Church would make us take.

59
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,440
- Tony.
- Ah, right, yes.

60
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,520
- You have to, uh, open the doors.
- No...

61
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,480
- You ready?
- You can't just leave it there.

62
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,240
Darling, we're half
an hour late as it is.

63
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,767
I've just effectively proposed.

64
00:07:47,792 --> 00:07:49,624
Oh, we can discuss this another time.

65
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,280
Fine. If what's important to me
isn't a priority for you...

66
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,360
- Is my car still outside?
- Yes, ma'am.

67
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,520
- Where are you going?
- Home.

68
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,880
But you came to support me.

69
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,440
Half those bloody journalists
have only come to see you.

70
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,080
Well, the work will have to speak
for itself. I'm sure it will.

71
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,640
Where's Her Royal Highness gone, Tony?

72
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,967
Oh, it's not really her sort of thing,

73
00:08:14,992 --> 00:08:17,504
but Larry Olivier's here
and Alec Guinness.

74
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,520
Marlene Dietrich, anyone?

75
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,480
That's her. Oi! Come on, lads.
She's coming out now.

76
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,880
Go. Go!

77
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,080
Ah, Lord and Lady Trenchard.
What a thrill.

78
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,173
Oh, you must come again.
It's been so long.

79
00:09:24,198 --> 00:09:26,184
I'd adore it. Much love, much love.

80
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,560
Ah!

81
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,640
- Hello, Mummy.
- Darling.

82
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,680
- I would like my usual, please.
- Very good.

83
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,360
Mnh-mnh.

84
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,880
So...

85
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,600
You didn't come to my exhibition.
After I reminded you, too.

86
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,320
There was a clash.

87
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,080
- Your brother...
- Half-brother.

88
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,600
...was on parade.

89
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,240
The Irish Guards are on parade
every month.

90
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,560
I have an opening like that once a year.

91
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,600
It was so important to him.

92
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,520
Well, there we are.

93
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,480
Michael.

94
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,480
The notices were favorable.

95
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,160
Very favorable, actually.

96
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,960
- Really? I read The Times.
- Mm.

97
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,040
The Times was the only naysayer.

98
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,440
Any mention of her?

99
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,400
Margaret? She wasn't there.

100
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,680
Oh.

101
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,120
- We had a tiff.
- What about?

102
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,560
Marriage, if you must know.

103
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,560
Mm-hmm.

104
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,960
- She's turned you down.
- No.

105
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,960
The other way round.

106
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,440
Are you mad?

107
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,280
You know, Mummy, for most parents...

108
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,520
there's never anyone good enough
for their children.

109
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,520
Your health.

110
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,000
What's the matter?

111
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,520
There's something I have to tell you.

112
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,320
- So I told Jacqui.
- How did she take it?

113
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,080
Not lying down.

114
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,240
Mind you,
she never takes anything lying down.

115
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,600
Far too conventional.

116
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:39,760
She really is the most dazzling fuck.

117
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:43,480
- Evidently.
- What is that supposed to mean?

118
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,960
Well, you've just become so much...

119
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,880
better since seeing her.

120
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,040
- Hear, hear.
- Have I?

121
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,000
I really can't keep up anymore.

122
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,280
- And you're more imaginative.
- Am I?

123
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,720
So don't give her up, whatever you do.

124
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,680
I won't.

125
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,880
Speaking of which,
I have to be in London on Thursday

126
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,480
and might have some time after lunch.

127
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,560
Is that a proposition?

128
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,960
It is. Any objections, Mr. Fry?

129
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,160
None at all, Mrs. Fry.

130
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,000
Can I get back to you on that?

131
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,280
I'm supposed
to be seeing Margaret that night.

132
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,320
That's all right.
I promise not to totally exhaust you.

133
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,040
I just thought that
I might pop the question to her then.

134
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,600
- Which question?
- That question.

135
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,520
You said she had thick ankles
and the face of a Jewish manicurist.

136
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,240
Well, she does.

137
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,400
But she's adorable, too.

138
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,680
- And with a quick temper.
- Oh, is that a plus?

139
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,520
It's not unsexy.

140
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,880
It doesn't mean you have to marry her.

141
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,120
I'm afraid I do.

142
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,640
Other reasons.

143
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,680
Don't ask me to explain.

144
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,200
Most of the species
in Galapagos are unique to the islands.

145
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:39,760
For instance,
this sea lion, uh, is a subspecies

146
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,440
found only in the Galapagos.

147
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,440
The land iguana,
not to be confused with the...

148
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,840
What's this?

149
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,400
Open it.

150
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,000
Will you forgive me
if I don't go down on one knee?

151
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,680
Hmm?

152
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,360
You won't defer to your princess,
even when you propose to her?

153
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,720
It's got nothing to do with deference.

154
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,680
They're chafed from fucking you.

155
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,600
Marry me.

156
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,920
I thought you hated the idea of marriage.

157
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,000
I do.

158
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,080
Then I hated the idea
of losing you even more.

159
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,080
You would have lost me.

160
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,720
You'd have come back.

161
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,800
Never.

162
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Promise me one thing.

163
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,680
Name it.

164
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,960
Not to bore me.

165
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,840
Fine.

166
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,560
Now promise me one thing in return.

167
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,960
Name it.

168
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,920
Not to hurt me.

169
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,280
I promise.

170
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,760
Tony has proposed marriage to me
and I've accepted.

171
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,600
That's marginally better than the "Oh,"

172
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,160
which was your reaction
to Peter Townsend's proposal.

173
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,200
Anyway, I do hope there won't be
any objections or obstacles this time.

174
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,400
No, of course not.

175
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,840
Be good enough to give me
that assurance again,

176
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:00,560
nice and audibly,
so we're both quite clear.

177
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,640
Margaret.

178
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,447
I promise that I will never do anything

179
00:23:11,472 --> 00:23:14,384
to block any marriage
of yours ever again.

180
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,320
Thank you.

181
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,767
So I have your blessing

182
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,584
to make the announcement
and start making plans?

183
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,640
- Yes...
- Good.

184
00:23:21,665 --> 00:23:22,980
Then forgive me for not staying longer.

185
00:23:23,005 --> 00:23:24,863
I'd just like to get cracking on this.

186
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:28,141
Peter wrote to me.

187
00:23:29,427 --> 00:23:31,030
He's marrying too.

188
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,800
She's 19.

189
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,800
- Oh, Margaret.
- So my announcement must come first.

190
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,760
Birr Castle. Good evening.

191
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,120
It's Tony Armstrong-Jones.
I'd like to speak to my mother.

192
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,080
I'll see if Lady Rosse is available.

193
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,880
Tell her it's important.

194
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,360
Lady Rosse is resting at the moment, sir.

195
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,440
She has asked
that you might call back again tomorrow.

196
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,320
Shit.

197
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,640
- Tony?
- Coming.

198
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,800
Ah.

199
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,440
Ma'am.

200
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,320
Do sit down, Michael.

201
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,600
So where shall we do it?
What do you fancy?

202
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,600
People will expect the abbey,

203
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,600
but since there's no danger
of my ever wearing the crown,

204
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,080
we can break with that, if we want.

205
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,360
And go to Gretna Green?

206
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,160
Why not?

207
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,320
Or Las Vegas.

208
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,360
I've been informed by Princess Margaret

209
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,120
that she's received a proposal
of marriage.

210
00:26:28,999 --> 00:26:30,547
She's accepted that proposal

211
00:26:30,572 --> 00:26:32,783
and now wishes to make
a public statement.

212
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,880
Would you kindly speak
to Commander Colville

213
00:26:34,905 --> 00:26:37,530
and the rest of the people
in the press office and

214
00:26:37,555 --> 00:26:39,009
ask them to help her?

215
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,840
Of course, ma'am.

216
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,200
And it is to be the photographer, ma'am?

217
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,040
Yes.

218
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:56,960
- Mr. Jones.
- Armstrong-Jones, I believe.

219
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,640
- I see.
- She's quite within her rights, Michael.

220
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,880
And she seems very determined.

221
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,880
And we can ill afford another drama
like Peter Townsend,

222
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,920
so I'm going to support it,
come what may.

223
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,200
Of course, ma'am.

224
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,880
There is one slight problem, though.

225
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,640
Wouldn't it be fun
if we did choose the abbey?

226
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,680
One half full of your friends,
one half full of mine.

227
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,560
New world, old world.

228
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,720
Like an eagle with two heads,
facing in opposite directions.

229
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,680
All right. Let's do the abbey.

230
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:50,640
And let's make it bigger
than my sister's. Let's eclipse her.

231
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,440
Let's shake this place to its core.

232
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,080
The decision we've come to

233
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:06,120
is a little announcement
followed by a big wedding...

234
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,360
at the abbey.

235
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,360
Ta-da!

236
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,707
I brought a copy of the statement

237
00:28:16,732 --> 00:28:18,704
which we'll give
to the newspapers tomorrow.

238
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,720
Well, what do you think?

239
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,680
It looks fine, but, uh...

240
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,080
No, don't come with "buts."

241
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,320
- We're going to have to delay it.
- Delay what?

242
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:46,040
The announcement. Just for a few months.

243
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,920
- Why?
- Because of the baby.

244
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,360
What baby?

245
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,400
Mine. I'm expecting.

246
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,200
Since when?

247
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,800
Fourteen weeks.

248
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,880
Why didn't you tell me that?

249
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,200
I've tried, but your head's been
in the clouds, understandably.

250
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:09,720
What has expecting
got to do with anything?

251
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:14,600
- Congratulations, by the way.
- Thank you. It's a protocol issue.

252
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,080
- Oh, pro... Oh, I understand!
- No, Margaret, you don't.

253
00:29:17,105 --> 00:29:18,147
This is just some

254
00:29:18,172 --> 00:29:20,621
scheme cooked up by all of you
to put me off the marriage.

255
00:29:20,646 --> 00:29:22,905
No. It's a tiresome protocol issue.

256
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,780
Until the sovereign's child is born,

257
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:26,384
no other family
announcements can be made.

258
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,400
Don't you see? Until we announce it,
we can't marry, either.

259
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,640
- No, just for six months.
- Another six months?

260
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,160
Margaret.

261
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,320
Most of that time will be taken up
with planning anyway.

262
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,080
Margaret. Margaret.

263
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:48,320
As indication of my support as Queen,
I intend to throw a party.

264
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:53,280
For the family. For your friends.
To show our support.

265
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,200
We never did that for Peter.

266
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,520
You never did anything for Peter.

267
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,880
Margaret, you have my word.
It's full steam ahead.

268
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:08,280
You will marry Tony.
We just can't announce it yet.

269
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,353
Mr. Aneurin Bevan, who

270
00:30:19,378 --> 00:30:21,464
if he isn't returned it'll be
a miracle, of course,

271
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,560
- with his enormous majority in...
- Bob.

272
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,760
Bob, I'll just interrupt you one second.
I'm being called for... Sorry.

273
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:32,640
I've stopped him now, so we'll just
confirm Edinburgh Pentlands.

274
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,320
Bob Mackenzie said
that Labour needed that swing,

275
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,120
two percent or more, to win the election.

276
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,960
At the beginning of the night,
it was all over the place.

277
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,760
One or two the other way
made us think we must hesitate,

278
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,480
but after 30 results it's settled down...

279
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,080
So it's most likely to be an earldom.

280
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,160
What they'll give me
to make me acceptable.

281
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,240
- An earldom?
- Mm.

282
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,720
Not a fucking dukedom.

283
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,560
Or a marquisate.

284
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,400
But as husband to the Queen's sister,

285
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,800
I'd still rank higher than the man
my mother took as her second husband,

286
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,080
the Irishman, when she left my father.

287
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,520
And I'd rank higher
than the son she gave him,

288
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:20,000
little Brendan, le vicomte.

289
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:27,520
On our trips to Ireland, he, Brendan,
would travel first class in the train

290
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,400
and my stepbrother would travel
in second class,

291
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,440
and I was made to travel third.

292
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:42,000
The runt son from the unsatisfactory
first marriage with no title.

293
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,880
And a polio-twisted leg.

294
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,040
Oh.

295
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,240
Could you? Would you? Thank you.

296
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,320
Love you.

297
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:02,680
27,055.

298
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:09,760
And this points to a Conservative
majority of 110 over Labour,

299
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,240
over 100 over all parties
in the next Parliament.

300
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,520
Are you in the mood for some questions?

301
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,040
It depends on the questions.

302
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,280
Does it hurt?

303
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:03,160
No, it doesn't hurt.

304
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,120
But it is uncomfortable,

305
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,846
especially if the baby's sitting
down in my pelvis or

306
00:33:12,513 --> 00:33:14,064
decides to kick me.

307
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,800
- No, you see, now you're not interested.
- I'm very interested.

308
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:23,935
One does feel cumbersome,
and I'm tired all the time

309
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:28,000
and I can't do anything
and I can't bend down.

310
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,640
It's rather like that journey
from Aberdeen to Balmoral.

311
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,560
- Don't.
- It just seems to go on forever.

312
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,280
And one's toes are disappearing.

313
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,480
Don't say that.

314
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,560
- I like your toes.
- My toes are hideous.

315
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,520
Don't be silly.
They're the second-best thing about you.

316
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,760
That's a horrible compliment.

317
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,040
There's no such thing
as a bad compliment.

318
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:54,080
That's true. Beggars can't be choosers.

319
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,320
What's the best thing?

320
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
What's the best thing?

321
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,520
Two things, really.

322
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,240
Oh!

323
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,400
Reason alone to have children, I'd say.
Enormous.

324
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,000
- Yes, all right.
- You milkmaid.

325
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,400
No. No, no. Barmaid.

326
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,280
- Oh.
- Go on, indulge me.

327
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,160
Pour me a pint.

328
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,200
Filthily. Go on.

329
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,120
- I haven't the faintest idea.
- Go on.

330
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,840
Like this.

331
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:44,000
Look me in the eyes
while you're doing it.

332
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,680
Go on.

333
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,373
I'd adore you to come to Birr in March.

334
00:35:38,398 --> 00:35:39,504
That's when we have the hunt.

335
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,280
- Really?
- Yes, and if you do...

336
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,880
- This way.
- Please, someone interesting.

337
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,240
Darling, this is John Beaufort.

338
00:35:50,265 --> 00:35:52,504
These are great friends of ours.

339
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,120
The little finger. The little finger.

340
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,960
Whiskey, please, darling.

341
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,520
What's the matter?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

342
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,720
Of course, in some ways, you have.

343
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,840
Hideous, redundant relics and specters,
all of them.

344
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,720
- No, it's not that.
- What?

345
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,120
- Two whiskeys, please.
- Certainly, sir.

346
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,760
I didn't want to tell you tonight.

347
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,640
What?

348
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,760
Tony, I'm pregnant.

349
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,040
Me?

350
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,720
- You can't be sure.
- I'm 99 percent.

351
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,480
Well, that still leaves one percent.

352
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,280
- Have you told Jeremy?
- Not yet. I daren't.

353
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,273
Well, he did Knollys House.

354
00:37:14,298 --> 00:37:15,344
Yes, yes.

355
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,960
And he adores it.
He's got it in his living room.

356
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,160
If any further evidence were needed

357
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,400
to prove that we are a changed country,
then this is it.

358
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,800
It's all changed so quickly.

359
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,840
- Within a generation.
- Yes.

360
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,760
Just 15 minutes ago, the British
government and establishment

361
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,680
were up in arms
about my joining this family.

362
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,461
- I remember.
- I was a royal prince

363
00:38:02,486 --> 00:38:03,704
from a royal house.

364
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,880
My great-great-grandmother
was Queen Victoria.

365
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,520
My father was a prince,
my grandfather was a king,

366
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,160
and everyone was mortified
at how inappropriate I was

367
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,640
and how low you were stooping.

368
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,480
- I know.
- I mean, this fella's mother...

369
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,840
- Stop it!
- ...is a ghastly social climber.

370
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,200
His father's a common-or-garden
contract lawyer who buggered off

371
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,520
with an airline stewardess

372
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,720
and everyone's throwing their hats
in the air, declaring it's a victory.

373
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,640
Not yet.

374
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,400
Pathetic.

375
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:34,960
Come on, Margaret. Now, follow me.

376
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,520
- Come on, everybody. Do join in.
- Please come on.

377
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,680
- Ma'am.
- Here we go.

378
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,920
- Michael.
- I'll lead the way.

379
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,560
If there was anything that one ought
to know about Mr. Armstrong-Jones

380
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,320
before he becomes part of this family,

381
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,160
it might be better to know
sooner rather than later.

382
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:01,120
What is it that Your Majesty
would like to know?

383
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,080
Coming through!

384
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,520
- Ma'am.
- Coming through.

385
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,160
Mind yourselves.

386
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,680
Whoa!

387
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,200
Lilibet.

388
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,280
- Michael.
- Morning, Tommy.

389
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:49,720
I hope Your Majesty
understands the context

390
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:53,320
in which this discreet
reconnaissance work was done

391
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,480
and that it in no way represents

392
00:39:55,560 --> 00:40:00,880
a prurient, moralistic
or censorious position.

393
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,720
Mr. Armstrong-Jones is perfectly entitled
in his private life

394
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,320
to make those choices he wishes,
indeed, to live as he wishes.

395
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:14,600
However, as with a great many artists,

396
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:19,440
the, uh, conventional approach to life
doesn't appear to fit.

397
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:24,120
It seems that what makes his work notable

398
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,720
is his willingness, his appetite,

399
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,440
to break barriers and conventions,

400
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:36,480
as he pushes his medium, photography,
I believe, to its boundaries,

401
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:40,040
and, um, as in art,

402
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,800
so, it would appear, in life.

403
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,720
I see.

404
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:56,160
The narrow path,
the straight, Christian path,

405
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,840
is not to his taste.

406
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,880
To the best of our knowledge...

407
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,320
...he is currently conducting

408
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:16,400
no fewer than three other
intimate relationships.

409
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,440
What?

410
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,800
With whom?

411
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:28,280
With a Miss Jacqui Chan,

412
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,040
an Oriental dancer and singer.

413
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:36,000
With Gina Ward, an actress.

414
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:41,680
And with a Miss Robin Banks,
his former assistant.

415
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,880
These, we should add...

416
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,240
Are just the natural ones.

417
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,480
What?

418
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:01,760
There is good reason
to suspect that Mr. Armstrong-Jones

419
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:04,800
has a taste for members of his own sex

420
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:09,040
and that his close friendship
with his proposed best man,

421
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,520
- Mr. Jeremy Fry, is...
- Yes.

422
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,000
- ...in fact...
- All right, Tommy.

423
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:20,400
Not to mention his wife.

424
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,560
- Please.
- Camilla.

425
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,080
Formerly Grinling.

426
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:30,200
An erstwhile girlfriend
of Armstrong-Jones.

427
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:33,960
Who is now expecting, herself.

428
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,120
Do you have a photograph of her?

429
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,200
We do.

430
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,600
Thank you, Michael.

431
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,480
If you agree, gentlemen, it's customary

432
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,520
to inform the Home Secretary
at this point.

433
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,160
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

434
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,680
- Christ, Jim.
- All right, all right, all right.

435
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,960
- OK?
- Right.

436
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,560
- Some twilight sleep, ma'am.
- Thank you.

437
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,647
I'm happy to tell you,

438
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:38,184
delivery of the Queen's child
is expected imminently.

439
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,080
Oh, well. Good gracious.

440
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,160
Well, um, perhaps a moment's prayer
on behalf of the government?

441
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:51,080
O Lord, our heavenly Father,
high and mighty,

442
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,120
king of kings, lord of lords...

443
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,280
There we are.

444
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,640
...the only ruler of princes,

445
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:01,640
who dost, from Thy throne,
behold all the dwellers upon Earth.

446
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:06,320
Most heartily, we beseech Thee,
with thy favor,

447
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:10,880
to behold our most gracious
Sovereign Lady, Queen Elizabeth,

448
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:16,000
and so replenish her
with the grace of thy Holy Spirit,

449
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,440
that she may always incline

450
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:21,960
to Thy will and walk in Thy way...

451
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:25,520
Endue her plenteously
with heavenly gifts.

452
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,480
Shit.

453
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,880
Grant her,
in health and wealth, long to live.

454
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,880
Strengthen her, that she may vanquish
and overcome all her enemies

455
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,360
and, finally, after this life...

456
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,120
Ah, shit!

457
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,880
...she may attain
everlasting joy and felicity

458
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:54,880
through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

459
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,960
- Amen.
- Amen.

460
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:22,440
Good baby. What a good baby.

461
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:25,560
This is London. Here is the news.

462
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:33,400
The new prince
will be second in line to the throne

463
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:36,480
and was born weighing
seven pounds and three ounces.

464
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,040
A name is expected to be announced soon.

465
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:43,440
Celebrations today include a 41-gun
salute by the Royal Horse Artillery

466
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:47,240
and a 21-gun salute by the Royal Navy.

467
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:50,160
This is the British
Broadcasting Corporation...

468
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,400
You have a new nephew, Your Highness.

469
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:09,200
Congratulations.

470
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,200
- Hello.
- Hello.

471
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,960
Look. He's beautiful.

472
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:24,840
- Thank you.
- Have you thought of a name?

473
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:30,203
Well, we briefly considered George,

474
00:47:30,585 --> 00:47:33,545
but there's been too many of those,
and anyway, no one could live up to Papa.

475
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,000
No.

476
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,520
And then we thought of Louis,
but that was a bit too...

477
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,200
- Foreign.
- Mm.

478
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:44,360
- So, we've decided upon Andrew.
- Oh...

479
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:45,560
After Philip's father.

480
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,840
Yes, the bankrupt philanderer.

481
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,080
Philip's father.

482
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:02,280
So, now the baby's here and healthy
and all is well, everybody's thrilled,

483
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:04,720
I would just like your blessing
for me and Tony to...

484
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:10,560
- Yes, you know what I'm about to say.
- Announce your engagement?

485
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:11,720
Yes.

486
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:15,440
Very well.

487
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,040
Thank you.

488
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:28,720
But before you announce it
and rush up the aisle...

489
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:37,160
are you sure that Tony's the right man?

490
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,520
- I can't believe you're doing this.
- Margaret.

491
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,280
In the first flush of a romantic love,
we're all blind.

492
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:53,280
We see only what we want to see.

493
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:58,120
- You hardly know him.
- And you know him even less.

494
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:02,680
I'm just concerned
that in a rush to heal wounds...

495
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:04,240
Wounds inflicted by you.

496
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:08,880
...you end up committing yourself
to something, someone,

497
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,760
that isn't quite right.

498
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,200
You told me yourself
you only embarked on this engagement

499
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:19,440
after you heard from Peter
that he intended to marry someone else.

500
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,400
I just want to make sure
that this isn't some kind of revenge.

501
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:28,320
Tony is no revenge.
Tony is a free choice.

502
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:32,415
Tony has given me reason
to hope and dream.

503
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:33,633
He makes me feel things

504
00:49:33,658 --> 00:49:36,704
no one ever has.

505
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,040
Things I didn't imagine possible.

506
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,400
I don't doubt that.

507
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:50,360
But he's also a very complicated man.

508
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:57,880
With a complicated past and, who knows,

509
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,520
a complicated present.

510
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,320
What is that supposed to mean?

511
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,200
Or is there something you know?

512
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,400
Because if there is, tell me now.

513
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,720
Tell me now.

514
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:31,240
I'm merely asking if he's the right man
for a lifelong commitment.

515
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,720
Is he really cut out for marriage
with all its ups and downs?

516
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,280
I will marry Tony
if it is the last thing I do.

517
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,940
At the Chelsea Registry Office,

518
00:50:42,965 --> 00:50:45,144
with a local drunk
as witness, if need be.

519
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:49,920
Because Tony makes sense of me,
defines me.

520
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:56,080
At long last, I know who I am
and what I represent.

521
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,520
And what is that?

522
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:04,840
A woman in my own right.

523
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,440
A woman for the modern age.

524
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,160
And, above all, a woman who is free.

525
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,680
Free to live, to love,

526
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,080
and free to break away.

527
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,880
But you're not breaking away.

528
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:28,080
Because you won't give up your title,
your rank, your privileges,

529
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,760
for one simple reason.

530
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,400
You enjoy it all too much.

531
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,200
The palaces, the privileges,
the deference.

532
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,920
It's always meant more to you
than it did to me.

533
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:44,320
Whereas all I wanted to do was...

534
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,080
give it all up...

535
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:51,480
disappear and become invisible.

536
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,400
Well, in that case, your achievement's
all the more remarkable.

537
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:04,447
As you've managed to disappear
and become invisible,

538
00:52:05,013 --> 00:52:06,864
while wearing the crown.

539
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,720
- Margaret...
- I'll see you in the abbey.

540
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
When the announcement of the betrothal

541
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:40,400
was made from Clarence House,

542
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:43,080
the reaction everywhere
was not only one of surprise

543
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,080
but also of the greatest pleasure.

544
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:54,480
Strange to be getting up
in a London street,

545
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:57,800
but you must have your hair looking
its best on a great day like this.

546
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,120
Before the great news was given,

547
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,880
the princess's fiancé was quite unknown
to the people of Britain.

548
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,660
Now everyone knows he's 29,

549
00:53:38,685 --> 00:53:40,904
the same age as Princess Margaret.

550
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,080
He was educated at Eton and at Cambridge,

551
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,880
where he coxed the winning crew in 1950,

552
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:48,560
and he's unconventional, talented
and very popular...

553
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:56,280
They spent some time
walking through the grounds

554
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:59,280
while the cameras continued
to make this delightful record.

555
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,120
Your father would have been proud.

556
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,560
Well, not bad, you'd have to say.

557
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
What?

558
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:47,720
For the son
that always brought you shame.

559
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:52,200
The son that you rejected.
The son that was never good enough.

560
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,760
I suppose I always thought
that eventually you'd find it in you

561
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,520
to admit that you're proud of me.

562
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,560
Perhaps even that you love me.

563
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:13,120
Darling, I do hope
you haven't done all this for me.

564
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:22,307
Antony Charles Robert,

565
00:57:22,332 --> 00:57:26,344
wilt thou have this woman
to thy wedded wife,

566
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:29,240
to live together after God's ordinance

567
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:32,440
in the holy estate of matrimony?

568
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:38,160
Wilt thou love her, comfort her,
honor and keep her,

569
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:41,120
in sickness and in health,

570
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:46,040
and, forsaking all other,
keep thee only unto her,

571
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:48,400
as long as ye both shall live?

572
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,000
I will.

573
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:02,440
Margaret Rose, wilt thou
have this man to thy wedded husband,

574
00:58:02,465 --> 00:58:07,865
to live together after God's ordinance
in the holy estate of matrimony?

575
00:58:07,890 --> 00:58:12,810
Wilt thou obey him and serve him,
love, honor and keep him,

576
00:58:12,835 --> 00:58:15,235
in sickness and in health,

577
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,720
and, forsaking all other...

578
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,880
...keep thee only unto him,

579
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:22,600
so long as ye both shall live?

580
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:23,960
I will.

581
00:58:25,213 --> 00:58:33,213
