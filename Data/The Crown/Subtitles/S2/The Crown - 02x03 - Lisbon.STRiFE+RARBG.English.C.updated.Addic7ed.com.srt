1
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,840
Now, Anne, what's this?

2
00:00:12,841 --> 00:00:14,722
- A penguin.
- Very good.

3
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:16,481
And, Charles, who do you suppose

4
00:00:16,482 --> 00:00:18,039
is surrounded by penguins at the moment?

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,039
- Daddy.
- Yes, that's right.

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,959
That's because he's in the
Antarctic, and from there,

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,764
he goes to the South Shetland Islands,

8
00:00:24,765 --> 00:00:26,839
then he goes on to the Falkland Islands.

9
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,719
And then he goes all the way
up here, to Ascension Island.

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,879
All these are British
Overseas Territories,

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,959
and they have to be visited
every once in a while,

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,119
so they don't feel
neglected or forgotten,

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,319
and don't get any silly ideas
like becoming independent.

14
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,199
- Right, brushed your teeth?
- Yes.

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,999
- Good. Have you said your prayers?
- Yes.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,760
- Jolly good. Right. Night-night.
- Night-night, Mommy.

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,519
Come along, children.

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,759
Oh, we might put a picture
of the Duke of Edinburgh

19
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,600
by the children's bed, so they
recognize him when he gets back.

20
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,119
Five months is a long time at that age.

21
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,440
Yes, ma'am.

22
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,440
- Oh, what's that?
- From His Royal Highness, ma'am.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,759
Footage from the Royal Tour.

24
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,920
How nice.

25
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,160
We might watch that
instead of our next film.

26
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,280
Kensington 3742.

27
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,520
Tommy.

28
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,879
The Prime Minister returns
after three weeks in Jamaica.

29
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,319
And here he is now!

30
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,000
Thank you. Thank you. It's
wonderful to be back amongst you.

31
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:45,280
As you know, I, uh... I went away
to concentrate on my health.

32
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,880
I'm now fully fit to resume my duties.

33
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,200
Thank you.

34
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,319
Quiet, everyone. Sit down you two.

35
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,559
- It's starting.
- Charles, come on, darling.

36
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,821
Now, he's sent some notes to accompany

37
00:04:01,822 --> 00:04:04,161
the footage, so I'll read aloud.

38
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,399
"Hello, all of you!"

39
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,459
Hello!

40
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,639
- "Hello, Daddy!"
- Hello, Daddy!

41
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,879
<i>"I can picture you all perfectly,</i>

42
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,199
<i>sitting there wishing it was</i>
Creature from the Black Lagoon.

43
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,719
But instead, this is just
boring old me arriving..."

44
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,279
- Penguins!
- That's not Daddy, is it?

45
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,599
"At King George Island..."

46
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,279
Look!

47
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,999
"A hundred miles off the
coast of Antarctica..."

48
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,559
- There's your daddy.
- Is that Daddy?

49
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,519
"And nestled between the white
bones of ancient whales.

50
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,879
Here we've made some new friends,
and Mike was rather smitten."

51
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,199
- Look how tame they are.
- He's got a beard!

52
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,999
Yes, yes. They're all growing beards.

53
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,319
It makes them look a bit shifty.

54
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,360
Oh, no, don't say that. It makes
him look like an explorer.

55
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,799
- What's that?
- This is very funny, Mommy.

56
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,759
Um, "We've even installed some signage
so we can find our way home."

57
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,959
Oh, Buckingham Palace! Oh,
that's good. I like that.

58
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,439
"It's a bit of a commute
to the office, though."

59
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,639
<i>"Luckily, we found some
friends for company,</i>

60
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,599
<i>the British Hunting
Aerosurvey teams, who make</i>

61
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,359
excellent tennis companions." Oh, look.

62
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,719
They're all playing
tennis. Isn't that silly?

63
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,999
Goodness me!

64
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,039
"Now, some things about
huskies that you never knew.

65
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,719
They have eyes of different colors."

66
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,600
- Oh, like the Kaiser.
- Oh, Mommy.

67
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,999
"But most of all, they really,
really like tennis balls."

68
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,239
Yes, we can see that.

69
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,919
"And they have claws to ensure
they don't slip on the ice."

70
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,000
Oh, look, now, Philip's on one.

71
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,920
"Joining our family of
animals are the penguins...

72
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,919
and seals, who send
their love to you all.

73
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,960
As do I.

74
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,960
Your loving papa...

75
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,800
<i>and husband.</i>

76
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,720
<i>Philip."</i>

77
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,380
Good morning.

78
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Tommy?

79
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,639
Your Majesty.

80
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,839
I thought you were supposed
to be in happy retirement.

81
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,680
- I am, ma'am.
- Then what on earth are you doing here?

82
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,899
Oh, dear. Either you missed the
place more than you could bear,

83
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,959
which would be...

84
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,160
- Tragic.
- Yes.

85
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,519
Or there's a serious problem, and
you've been called in to help.

86
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,679
Yep. Just a routine matter
with Colonel Adeane, ma'am.

87
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,560
It's hardly routine if he
sent one of the royal cars.

88
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,679
Well, in actual fact, that's my car.

89
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,919
We gave you a car?

90
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,919
You did, ma'am. As part
of the farewell package.

91
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,239
Not the driver too, surely?

92
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,280
The driver too.

93
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,081
- Was that me?
- I believe so.

94
00:07:18,082 --> 00:07:19,999
Well, you've always held
a very special place

95
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,961
in all of our hearts, Tommy.

96
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,939
Anyway, I must go.

97
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,040
Windsor, ma'am?

98
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,520
No, Sandringham.

99
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,719
Michael's re-arranged things to
give me a couple of days off.

100
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,080
Quite right.

101
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,520
<i> You did well to bring
this to me, Michael.</i>

102
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,960
I've served three generations of
the royal family, four monarchs...

103
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:56,719
and done a good many things to protect
them, mostly from themselves,

104
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,159
but this is the first
time I shall endeavor

105
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,080
to save someone else's marriage
in order to safeguard the Crown.

106
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,828
Not that we give a fig about the Parkers

107
00:08:06,829 --> 00:08:08,641
or their happiness, you understand.

108
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,120
Not a fig, Tommy.

109
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,800
<i> Dear Philip...</i>

110
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,280
<i>I cannot tell you how much we
enjoyed watching the film you sent.</i>

111
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,000
<i>It was lovely to set eyes on you again.</i>

112
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,200
<i>And the children were very impressed
by the whales and penguins.</i>

113
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,399
<i>You looked very handsome, I thought,</i>

114
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,960
<i>in your whaling outfit,</i>

115
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,279
<i>and hirsute, too.</i>

116
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,479
"And I can never forget what
my grandmother said to me

117
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,639
about being married to
a man with a beard."

118
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,639
<i>She goes on, but actually no,</i>

119
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,039
I'm not going to repeat that bit.

120
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,239
Oh, come on. Don't be a spoilsport.

121
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,199
- Come on!
- Ah!

122
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,119
Bloody hell!

123
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,999
I think we can safely say
a very, very warm welcome

124
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,199
awaits His Royal Highness's return.

125
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,840
Good morning.

126
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,160
Morning.

127
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,999
First of all, I must thank you

128
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,680
for the way in which you have
all carried on without me...

129
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,119
and for the manner in which
Rab has very competently

130
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,759
stood in for me in my absence.

131
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,416
You've kept me informed of
all the major decisions

132
00:10:11,417 --> 00:10:12,861
that had to be taken.

133
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:17,320
In all these months, we have
been a united government.

134
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,999
And we shall remain a united government.

135
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,079
But we're not a united government,

136
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,360
are we, Anthony?

137
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:30,239
The war you insisted on has left
us as divided as Caesar and Pompey

138
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,840
and the country in chaos.

139
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,839
There is no petrol in the pumps.
There are no tins on the shelves.

140
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,079
Our allies are aligned against us.

141
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,920
Our international
reputation is in tatters.

142
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,880
How adroitly your weather
vane spins, Harold.

143
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,319
You were for the war... as I remember.

144
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,080
Only as long as it was legal.

145
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,120
You...

146
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,360
liar!

147
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,800
Liar!

148
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,900
You wanted it every
bit as much as I did!

149
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,759
You'd have torn off Nasser's scalp

150
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,320
with your own fingernails
given the chance,

151
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,199
taken the oil from that canal
and set the Middle East ablaze!

152
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,000
You've lost the trust of the
people and of the party.

153
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,160
It's the end of the road.

154
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,280
A road which you willingly led me down!

155
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,320
And would you abandon me?

156
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,080
Here?

157
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,960
Hmm?

158
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,720
All of you.

159
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,880
Come now, Anthony...

160
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,360
you know as well as I...

161
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,680
there is no justice in politics.

162
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,720
Captain Lascelles?

163
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,440
Mrs. Parker.

164
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,000
- What brings you here?
- Oh.

165
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,359
A retired man must make friends

166
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,919
with all the good reading
spots in London.

167
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,519
What are you reading, may I ask?

168
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,600
Tell me that it's romantic poetry.

169
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,080
Military history.

170
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,640
The campaigns of Napoleon.

171
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,159
- Your son?
- Yes.

172
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,240
Lieutenant Commander
Parker must be very proud.

173
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,920
He might be. If he knew what
the children looked like.

174
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,119
He's away again. On tour.

175
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,800
You have my sympathy.

176
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,599
I know from my own wife how
difficult that can be.

177
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,439
Being left alone with
the children for days,

178
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,480
sometimes weeks on end.

179
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,280
Well, I'm sure that strong
marriages find a way through it.

180
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,560
I'm afraid it's broken ours.

181
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,160
I am sad to hear that.

182
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,399
Might I ask if you'll hold off on any

183
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,000
instruction or public announcement
just a little while longer?

184
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,839
As we both know, the Duke of Edinburgh

185
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,639
is performing important
royal duties on this tour,

186
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,759
and we wouldn't want any story
breaking in the newspapers

187
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,600
that might undermine his efforts.

188
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,640
Or impugn the royal marriage.

189
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,760
That's what you came here for, isn't it?

190
00:13:48,764 --> 00:13:51,319
This wasn't a coincidence at all.

191
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,179
You came here because you
knew it's where I'd be,

192
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,800
and you wanted to put in a word
on their behalf. It's pathetic.

193
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,960
Still their round-the-clock
lackey, even in retirement.

194
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,799
<i> Sorry to disturb you, ma'am.</i>

195
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,281
<i>I've just had a call
from Downing Street.</i>

196
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,201
The Prime Minister has
requested an audience,

197
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:30,879
as a matter of urgency.

198
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,080
He's on the train and will
be with us by three p.m.

199
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,440
<i>Platform one, London train.</i>

200
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,720
<i>Please stand back from the edge.</i>

201
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,999
Eden! Eden!

202
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,200
Thank you.

203
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,560
Eden must go!

204
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,919
Of course, I asked for second opinions.

205
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,480
I asked for third opinions.

206
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,679
I implored them to let me carry on.

207
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:22,120
But I'm afraid the doctors
were of one voice, one mind.

208
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,080
The time has come to put my
health above the country...

209
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,160
and to...

210
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,320
Uh...

211
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,160
To offer you my resignation.

212
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,720
I'm sorry if I, uh...

213
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,600
disappointed you.

214
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,560
Did I suggest that you had?

215
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,360
No, but I...

216
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,159
I think you thought it.

217
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I...

218
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:10,000
I did think that the decision
to go to war was rushed.

219
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,559
And I was sorry to see you lie
to the House, when you told them

220
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,040
that you had no prior knowledge
of the Israelis' intentions.

221
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,960
We both know that to be untrue.

222
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,160
But, wrong though it was...

223
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,280
I did have sympathy for you.

224
00:17:29,613 --> 00:17:31,800
To have waited in the wings for so long

225
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,519
and to have supported a great man

226
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:40,360
like Winston so patiently, so loyally.

227
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,534
And then to finally
have your opportunity

228
00:17:43,535 --> 00:17:45,601
to measure yourself against him.

229
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,399
To do nothing is

230
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,680
often the best course of action...

231
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:58,720
but I know from personal experience
how frustrating it can be.

232
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,720
History was not made by
those who did nothing.

233
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:12,200
So, I suppose it's only natural
that ambitious men, driven men...

234
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,560
want to go down in history.

235
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,840
Or make history by going down.

236
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,439
<i>I do think the time has come</i>

237
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,839
<i>where we have no option
but to tell Her Majesty</i>

238
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,479
<i>about the Parker divorce,</i>

239
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,799
<i>and to warn her</i>

240
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,079
<i>that regardless of how blameless
the Duke of Edinburgh is</i>

241
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,039
<i>or isn't in the matter,</i>

242
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:01,079
<i>that newspapers will be newspapers,
and questions will now</i>

243
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,959
<i>inevitably be asked about the
state of the royal marriage.</i>

244
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,000
Hmm.

245
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,760
I sense trepidation, Michael.

246
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,079
<i>If you'd rather, I can
always handle it myself.</i>

247
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,280
No, I'll take care of this...

248
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,579
<i>and try to find a moment on the
train to mention it to Her Majesty.</i>

249
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,760
Good luck, Michael.

250
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,572
<i> Sorry to disturb you, ma'am.</i>

251
00:19:29,573 --> 00:19:31,799
<i>A telegram arrived from Lord Salisbury,</i>

252
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,359
<i>and the recommendation is
that Sir Anthony's successor</i>

253
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,959
should be Mr. Macmillan.

254
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,520
Of course. Thank you.

255
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,560
- Yes, what is it, Michael?
- Uh, it's just to say...

256
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,879
and we could, of course,
discuss this on our return

257
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,159
to the palace if Her Majesty prefers.

258
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,960
No. Do sit down, Michael.

259
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,960
Thank you, ma'am.

260
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,000
Um, but it seems that...

261
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:08,679
Mrs. Parker, uh, who is the wife
of Lieutenant Commander Parker...

262
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,800
Yes, I know who Eileen is.

263
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:18,320
Um, she has decided to sue
her husband for divorce.

264
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,439
Goodness. Is that what you
wanted to talk to me about?

265
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,240
Yes. Um...

266
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,479
And that while, of course, there
is no suggestion whatsoever

267
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,839
of any impropriety on the
part of His Royal Highness,

268
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,839
the Duke of Edinburgh, we should
perhaps be bracing ourselves

269
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,359
for one or two irritating headlines.

270
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,280
Why? Whatever for?

271
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,160
What is it that she's alleging?

272
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,760
Cruelty, unlawful desertion and, uh...

273
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,240
Uh, adultery, ma'am.

274
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,639
We're just aware of the fact
that Lieutenant Commander Parker

275
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,719
is His Royal Highness's private
secretary, he's a close friend,

276
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,560
and there is this letter, I believe.

277
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,320
A letter?

278
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,314
Written by Lieutenant Commander Parker

279
00:21:08,315 --> 00:21:11,279
to his fellow members of the lunch club,

280
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:16,399
bragging about exploits
on the royal tour.

281
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,600
What sort of exploits?

282
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,279
- Uh...
- No...

283
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,600
I don't need an answer to that
question. Thank you, Michael.

284
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,760
Thank you, ma'am.

285
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,280
Mr. Macmillan, Your Majesty.

286
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Your Majesty.

287
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,120
I gather soundings have been taken,

288
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,879
and that you have been
chosen by your colleagues

289
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,439
as the man most able to unite the
government and lead this country

290
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,339
following Sir Anthony's resignation.

291
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,400
Yes, ma'am.

292
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,880
Congratulations.

293
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,159
Although I fear you've inherited
something of a poisoned chalice.

294
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:46,280
It's true. The storm is
now raging against us.

295
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,759
With Eden's war, we've
discarded the moral advantage

296
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,919
or any goodwill we once held.

297
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,320
Not to mention the dire
economic situation.

298
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,159
It's really been quite ruinous.

299
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:04,240
But it wasn't just Eden's war, was it?

300
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,800
It was a war prosecuted by a government

301
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:12,720
of which you, as chancellor,
were a major constituent part.

302
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,119
I also seem to remember that you
were one of the loudest voices

303
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,400
in support of the war in the beginning.

304
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:26,960
One always has to accept
one's own part, I believe...

305
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,680
in any mess.

306
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,240
Prime Minister.

307
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,480
Your Majesty.

308
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,000
Michael, could you ask them to
send 'round one of the cars?

309
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,039
<i>Bridge receiving. Go ahead.</i>

310
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,119
<i>D-Watch requests permission to leave.</i>

311
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,840
<i>Granted. Affirmative.</i>

312
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,319
<i>Ship's communication to bridge.</i>

313
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,799
<i>Bridge receiving. Go ahead.</i>

314
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,920
Do you have a moment?

315
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,640
What were you thinking?

316
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:10,320
You know the rules.
No letters to anyone.

317
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,120
I told Baron to be discreet.

318
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,879
But somehow the letter
got back to Eileen.

319
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,920
And now she has written to the palace...

320
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,840
to give notice of her intention
to sue me for divorce.

321
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,640
Which means it's got
back to you-know-who.

322
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,520
Yes.

323
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,600
<i>I think we have to assume so.</i>

324
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,520
Don't tease me like that.

325
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,000
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

326
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,440
I remember how we used
to do this in Malta.

327
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,840
Go grocery shopping together.

328
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,000
Feels like a long time ago.

329
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,920
Yes.

330
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,480
The reason I came here today is, uh...

331
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,440
because I heard, with great sadness,

332
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,120
that there are difficulties
in your marriage.

333
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,840
And I would like to know if
there's anything that I or...

334
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,919
anyone else can do to help.

335
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,240
My marriage to Mike is beyond help.

336
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:06,999
I see.

337
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,240
Our separation has been
inevitable for some time.

338
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,488
I had intended to
divorce Mike years ago,

339
00:27:12,489 --> 00:27:13,785
but because of the attention

340
00:27:13,786 --> 00:27:15,631
surrounding Group Captain Townsend

341
00:27:15,632 --> 00:27:17,041
and Princess Margaret...

342
00:27:17,867 --> 00:27:19,307
I decided to hold back.

343
00:27:19,308 --> 00:27:20,348
Thank you.

344
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,040
But that was then. This is now.

345
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,720
What's changed?

346
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,240
Nothing has changed. That's the problem.

347
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,039
It just got worse.

348
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,968
And while some women may elect

349
00:27:35,969 --> 00:27:38,439
to put up with this sort of humiliation,

350
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,565
I simply have too much
respect for myself

351
00:27:40,566 --> 00:27:42,961
and my children to bear it.

352
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,440
I'm afraid I don't know
what you're talking about.

353
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,160
Then read this.

354
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,240
Hmm.

355
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,400
Don't bury it, ma'am...

356
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,360
or sweep it away.

357
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,640
It's there, in black and white.

358
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,760
Might I ask you a favor?

359
00:28:48,333 --> 00:28:49,921
That you hold off your announcement,

360
00:28:49,922 --> 00:28:51,825
just while we work out what to do,

361
00:28:51,826 --> 00:28:53,119
in light of this?

362
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,640
I've had enough of favors to you people.

363
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,880
My entire adult life has
been favors to you.

364
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,408
You people aren't even remotely aware

365
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:05,632
of the cost of the damage to families

366
00:29:05,633 --> 00:29:07,320
and marriages in your service.

367
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,720
I've instructed a solicitor.
That's my decision.

368
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,993
Gentlemen,

369
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:23,279
I would like to make a brief
statement on behalf of my client,

370
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,920
Mrs. Eileen Parker.

371
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:32,200
"Having endured an unhappy
marriage for some years now,

372
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,159
I have come to the sad conclusion

373
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:37,400
that a formal separation is
the best option for us both.

374
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,959
My husband has shown no
inclination or enthusiasm

375
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,160
for the responsibilities of
parenthood or marriage...

376
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,440
and divorce remains the only solution."

377
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,240
Thank you.

378
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,640
Mr. Lewis!

379
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,759
Duke's best friend and wife
separate, read all about it!

380
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,320
Read all about it!

381
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,640
No.

382
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,600
Sir.

383
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Uh...

384
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,572
Telegram from my lawyer in London.

385
00:31:11,573 --> 00:31:14,681
His view is that, yes, the
newspaper coverage is bad,

386
00:31:14,682 --> 00:31:16,119
but it's not disastrous,

387
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:19,520
and he feels confident it'll
all die down in 48 hours.

388
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,840
He thinks we can ride it out.

389
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,000
You and I both know
that's wishful thinking.

390
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,640
I've had my own telegram from London.

391
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,440
I...

392
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,080
I hope you're not going to make
this next step difficult for me.

393
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,120
No.

394
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,719
You'll have my resignation first thing.

395
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,760
I'll need it now.

396
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,680
I hereby offer my resignation...

397
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,839
as Principal Private Secretary
to the Duke of Edinburgh.

398
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,000
Effective immediately.

399
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,200
Accepted.

400
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,880
You've worked for me for long
enough. You know the rules.

401
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,320
Who we are. How it works.

402
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:37,240
There is no room for mistakes.
There is no room for scandal.

403
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,360
There is no room for humanity.

404
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,840
I think you should probably
leave us in Gibraltar.

405
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,159
Might I suggest a policy of
"no comment" on all counts,

406
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,520
and especially no letters?

407
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,280
Yes, of course.

408
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,279
Commander Parker!

409
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,040
Did the Duke fire you, sir?

410
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,799
Just a few words? Just a few words, sir?

411
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,840
Piss off.

412
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,440
Go on, piss off.

413
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:45,880
Go on now. Go on! Go on, I've
got nothing to say. Piss off!

414
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,714
<i>Following the resignation</i>

415
00:33:48,715 --> 00:33:50,346
<i>of Lieutenant Commander Parker,</i>

416
00:33:50,347 --> 00:33:52,588
<i>the British press have fallen into line</i>

417
00:33:52,589 --> 00:33:54,842
<i>and been overwhelmingly supportive.</i>

418
00:33:54,843 --> 00:33:56,279
<i> But?</i>

419
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:00,520
<i> I'm afraid the foreign
newspapers have not been so kind.</i>

420
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,199
Yesterday, a story broke
in the<i> Baltimore Sun...</i>

421
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,440
- Where?
- Baltimore, Mommy.

422
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,719
Claiming that the capital
was awash with rumor

423
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:12,199
that the Duke of Edinburgh
was romantically involved

424
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:15,679
with an unnamed woman whom
he met on a regular basis

425
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:19,360
in the West End apartment of a
society photographer, Baron Nahum.

426
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:24,159
Nahum is also president of
the Thursday Club in Soho,

427
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,639
of which the Duke of Edinburgh
is a founder member.

428
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:30,699
Anyway, that story has
rather lit the touch paper.

429
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,656
The British press has caught on,

430
00:34:32,657 --> 00:34:35,159
with<i> The Manchester Guardian</i> reporting,

431
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,279
"Not since the first rumors of a romance

432
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,600
between the former King Edward
VIII and Mrs. Ernest Simpson

433
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:46,000
have Americans gobbled up the
London dispatches so avidly."

434
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,658
Go on.

435
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:51,801
The<i> Sunday Pictorial,</i> on its front page,

436
00:34:51,802 --> 00:34:53,719
reminds its readers
that the royal family

437
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:58,439
"is loved and envied throughout the
world because it is a family."

438
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:02,359
<i>Time</i> magazine has a headline:
"Too Much Thursdaying."

439
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:05,559
It goes on to say, "Not
since Wallis Simpson

440
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,681
stalked the corridors
of Buckingham Palace

441
00:35:07,682 --> 00:35:09,205
have the eyes of the world

442
00:35:09,206 --> 00:35:13,920
been turned so beadily towards
those chintz drapes."

443
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,560
I say we fly the Duke of
Edinburgh back straight away.

444
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,520
That's one thought, Your
Majesty. And it's a good one.

445
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,199
The devil's advocate might argue,

446
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,599
and I'd be interested to hear
Michael's thoughts on this,

447
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:44,599
that the Duke's early return, obviously
stage-managed by the palace,

448
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,839
might appear too much of a
concession to the newspapers

449
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:51,520
and pour even more petrol on the flames.

450
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,880
I would agree.

451
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,080
And we don't want that.

452
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,640
No.

453
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,680
So, what then?

454
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,360
What?

455
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,999
Yes?

456
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,280
The Admiral would like a word, sir.

457
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,719
That's fine. Tell him he can come.

458
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,560
As a matter of fact, he suggested
you go to see him, sir.

459
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,360
- Thank you, sir.
- Sir.

460
00:37:02,326 --> 00:37:03,700
But if something

461
00:37:03,701 --> 00:37:05,879
has to attack Chinese
currents in a Flycatcher

462
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,279
and then put down on the
deck of a Hermes...

463
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,320
Admiral.

464
00:37:10,699 --> 00:37:12,379
Oh, do come in, commander.

465
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,245
Thank you.

466
00:37:14,246 --> 00:37:15,879
Buckingham Palace has been in touch

467
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:19,079
regarding your reunion photo-call
with Her Majesty the Queen.

468
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,000
With you? Not me?

469
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,160
I am in command of this ship.

470
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,520
I am her husband.

471
00:37:26,846 --> 00:37:28,934
It's been agreed that Her
Majesty will fly out to Lisbon

472
00:37:28,935 --> 00:37:30,481
a day ahead of schedule.

473
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,441
- As I see it, your instructions...
- Instructions?

474
00:37:33,442 --> 00:37:35,239
Are to meet her at the airfield.

475
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:38,280
They've been quite specific for
how the reunion is to be managed.

476
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,720
Thank you.

477
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,160
Tie.

478
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,339
Not that one. One that's
fit for an adult.

479
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,679
Those were the instructions.

480
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,880
For God's sake. It has hearts on it.

481
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,239
And the hat, too?

482
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,399
- Yes, sir.
- I hate hats.

483
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,639
I believe its value on this occasion

484
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,159
is not in its being worn,
but in its being removed.

485
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,200
Ah.

486
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,519
"In a gesture of
chivalry and deference."

487
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,120
Before I enter the aircraft.

488
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,520
Before you reach the
stairs of the aircraft.

489
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,159
Michael.

490
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,640
Your hat, sir.

491
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,899
Yes, perhaps it would be prudent

492
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,445
to postpone the civic lunches...

493
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,320
Darling.

494
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,240
We'll talk later.

495
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,320
Shall we?

496
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,560
Your Majesty!

497
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:25,279
And here they are. Reunited
at last, but for how long?

498
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,480
Your Royal Highness!

499
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,680
Have you missed her?

500
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,119
...and display a united
front to the world.

501
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,880
This will do little to
quell rumors of a rift.

502
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,599
Unprecedented scenes here

503
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,599
as photographers from
all over the world...

504
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,399
The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh

505
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:20,080
hide from the world's eyes
on board the Royal Yacht.

506
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,839
Now the eyes of the world
turn towards the Royal Yacht,

507
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,680
on which they have sought shelter.

508
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,960
No, no. No, I see.

509
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,880
Thank you.

510
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,360
That was the palace press secretary.

511
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,774
In his view, the steps we've taken...

512
00:41:44,775 --> 00:41:46,593
The show we've put on.

513
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,080
The steps that we've taken
haven't quite done the trick.

514
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,720
The rumors still haven't gone away.

515
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,680
I think we both agree it
can't go on like this.

516
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,840
No.

517
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:34,400
So I thought we might
take this opportunity...

518
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,880
without the children,
without distraction...

519
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,960
to lay our cards on the table...

520
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,480
and talk frankly for once...

521
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:51,360
about what needs to change
to make this marriage work.

522
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,559
All right. Who goes first?

523
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,861
Stupid question. If I've
learned one thing by now,

524
00:42:56,862 --> 00:42:58,420
it's that I go second.

525
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,720
If I am to go first,
that's where I'd start.

526
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,760
Your complaining.

527
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,079
- My complaining?
- It's incessant.

528
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,999
Whining and whingeing like a child.

529
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,040
Are you surprised?

530
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,299
The way those god-awful mustaches
that run the palace continue

531
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,359
to infantilize me.

532
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,910
If you weren't behaving
like an infant...

533
00:43:17,911 --> 00:43:19,199
Giving me lists, instructions.

534
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,519
"Do this, don't do that,
wear this, don't wear that,

535
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,719
say this, not that."

536
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,292
Can you imagine anything
more humiliating?

537
00:43:24,293 --> 00:43:27,120
Yes. As a matter of fact, I can.

538
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,959
I've learned more about
humiliation in the past few weeks

539
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,800
than I hoped I would in a lifetime.

540
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:43,840
I've never felt more alone than
I have in the past five months.

541
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,840
And why do you think that was?

542
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,559
- Because of your behavior.
- Because you sent me away.

543
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:54,600
- Yes. And why do you think that was?
- I don't know. You tell me.

544
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,919
Because you're lost.

545
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:59,720
You're lost in your role, and
you're lost in yourself.

546
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,480
Christ!

547
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,320
Look...

548
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,434
I realize

549
00:44:07,435 --> 00:44:09,912
this marriage has turned out to
be something quite different

550
00:44:09,913 --> 00:44:12,119
- to what we both imagined.
- Understatement.

551
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,720
And that we both find ourselves in a...

552
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,080
Prison?

553
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:23,840
In a situation that is unique.

554
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,200
Our marriage is different to any
other in the country because

555
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:31,199
the exit route which is
open to everyone else...

556
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,240
Divorce?

557
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,600
Yes, divorce.

558
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,080
It's not an option for us.

559
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,360
Ever.

560
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:54,680
No.

561
00:45:04,207 --> 00:45:06,441
This... This restlessness of yours,

562
00:45:06,442 --> 00:45:08,248
it has to be a thing of the past.

563
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,600
It's what I need.

564
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,520
And it's what our family needs.

565
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,519
The monarchy's too fragile.

566
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:22,839
You keep telling me
yourself, one more scandal,

567
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:25,960
one more national embarrassment
and it would all be over.

568
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,640
So, what would make it easier on you?

569
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,880
To be in, not out.

570
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,520
What will it take?

571
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,720
You're asking my price?

572
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:56,040
I'm asking... what it will take.

573
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,400
All right.

574
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:16,160
To make it work... to
make it bearable...

575
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:20,520
I'll need the respect and acknowledgment
of the dreaded mustaches.

576
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,519
Please stop calling them that.

577
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:25,319
I'll stop calling them that
when they don't all have one.

578
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:28,279
An end to their snobbery and
prejudice, no more being sniffed at

579
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,919
for being a foreigner with a
background nobody understands.

580
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:33,039
You will earn their respect
with your behavior.

581
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,999
No. No. No.

582
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,356
I will earn their respect

583
00:46:36,357 --> 00:46:39,012
with the only thing those
creatures understand,

584
00:46:39,013 --> 00:46:40,319
a gesture, a statement.

585
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:43,279
Something irrefutable that shuts
them up and commands their respect.

586
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,719
Right now, I am currently outranked
by my eight-year-old son!

587
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,960
Well, yes, of course. He's
the heir to the throne.

588
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,200
I am his father, Elizabeth.

589
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,359
<i> Her Majesty the Queen</i>

590
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:15,800
has been pleased by Letters Patent
under the Great Seal of the Realm

591
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:20,559
bearing the date the
22nd of February, 1957,

592
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,440
to give and to grant

593
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,840
unto his Royal Highness,
the Duke of Edinburgh,

594
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:31,694
<i>the style and titular
dignity of a prince</i>

595
00:47:31,695 --> 00:47:36,441
<i>of the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland.</i>

596
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:43,239
<i>The Duke of Edinburgh
shall henceforth be known</i>

597
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:48,320
<i>as His Royal Highness, the Prince
Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.</i>

598
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,920
"O, famous son of England, this is he.

599
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:00,000
Great by land and great by sea.

600
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,239
Thine island loves thee well,

601
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:06,119
thou greatest sailor
since our world began."

602
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,840
Quite marvelous, sir. Thank you.

603
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:12,479
"Now to the roll of muffled drums,

604
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,239
to thee the greatest soldier comes.

605
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,879
For this is he, O give him welcome.

606
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:21,560
This is he, England's greatest son.

607
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:24,120
He that gained a hundred fights,

608
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,000
nor ever lost an English gun."

609
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,480
Quite magnificent, sir.

610
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:33,599
Quite marvelous.

611
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:36,599
Michael? Do you have a moment?

612
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:37,640
Of course, ma'am.

613
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,680
Sorry it's a bit gloomy.

614
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:23,560
A bit?

615
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:26,879
I was never much good around
the house without Eileen.

616
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,600
You could have at least put the fire on.

617
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:31,959
Hey. I've provided whiskey, all right?

618
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:34,879
I've burnt some sausages. Who
do you think you are, royalty?

619
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,040
Here you are.

620
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:53,199
- To our wives and sweethearts.
- May they never meet.

621
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,439
What will you do now?
Go back to the Navy?

622
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:01,280
No. I'm going back home.

623
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,080
The Navy is home.

624
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:04,920
My other home.

625
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,679
Australia.

626
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:07,720
Oh.

627
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,160
Can I come?

628
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,239
And I thought everything was
all sorted in your world.

629
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:17,200
Well, as sorted as it can
be. When you sell yourself.

630
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,479
- She wants more children.
- Ouch!

631
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,347
I told her the last
thing the world needs

632
00:52:32,348 --> 00:52:33,679
is more royal mouths to feed.

633
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:37,879
She said, "You should think
of it as a second act."

634
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:39,359
Of what? A Greek tragedy?

635
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:40,960
Of her life as a mother.

636
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:45,830
That makes sense, from her perspective.

637
00:52:45,831 --> 00:52:46,980
Hmm.

638
00:52:46,981 --> 00:52:49,040
Charles isn't a child to her, is he?

639
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:50,920
He's also the Crown.

640
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:55,960
A living embodiment of who will
replace her. Supersede her.

641
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,079
Loving a child who, through
no fault of his own,

642
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:02,079
represents your own death can't be easy.

643
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:05,400
- No.
- Because she's a little cold with him.

644
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,360
She tries her best.

645
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,920
Might be nice to have a couple
of kids that are just kids.

646
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,920
Not mortal threats.

647
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:16,840
Who she can actually love.

648
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:21,160
Ah.

649
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,600
It's the airport driver.

650
00:53:29,586 --> 00:53:31,046
What will I do without you?

651
00:53:31,606 --> 00:53:33,385
I'm always at the end of a telephone.

652
00:53:33,386 --> 00:53:34,680
That's it then?

653
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:36,760
End of an era.

654
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:43,400
Thank you for that era.

655
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,080
No. No, Mike.

656
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:49,800
Thank you.

657
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,160
- Sir.
- Philip.

658
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,280
Sir.

659
