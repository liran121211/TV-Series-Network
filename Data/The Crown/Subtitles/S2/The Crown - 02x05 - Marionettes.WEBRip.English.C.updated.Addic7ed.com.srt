1
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,680
Queen's critic is at it again!

2
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,280
Peer attacks the Queen!

3
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,280
Thank you.

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,920
Queen's critic!

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,640
Queen's critic is at it again!

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,400
- Good morning, Jack.
- Good morning, sir.

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,920
I'll take one of each
this morning, please.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
- And the Sunday as well.
- Oh, a bit of light reading, eh?

9
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,640
That's right.

10
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,880
Queen's critic is at it again!
Peer attacks the Queen!

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,560
No, I shan't have anything.

12
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,360
Sorry, dear.

13
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,160
- I think he's right.
- Do you?

14
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,840
Yeah. Now I think about it,
she is a bit priggish.

15
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,920
Here he comes, here he comes.

16
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,760
There he is.

17
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,560
- Please, gentlemen.
- Don't push.

18
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,920
- Lord Altrincham?
- Yes.

19
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,960
You traitor!

20
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,760
Really?

21
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,160
Really?

22
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,880
Really?

23
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,920
Well, I shall certainly let
Her Majesty know. Thank you.

24
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,160
Time and tide, Mr. Conservator.

25
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,880
Wait for no man, Private Secretary.

26
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,720
- Good afternoon to you.
- Good afternoon, sir.

27
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,440
What is it now?

28
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,120
Lord Altrincham has been struck.

29
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,880
Dumb, I hope.

30
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,800
Better than that, ma'am.

31
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,600
In the face.

32
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,200
Quite forcefully, I'm told.

33
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,400
By whom?
Which gallant and chivalrous individual?

34
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,280
Afraid we don't have
those details yet, ma'am.

35
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,600
The incident occurred
outside the television studios,

36
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,080
and the perpetrator is now on his way
to the Bow Street Police Station,

37
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,320
where we expect him to be released
without charge.

38
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,220
How very gratifying.

39
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,920
Yes. Very.

40
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,640
Which television studios?

41
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,920
The Independent Television
Network Studios, ma'am,

42
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,440
where Altrincham had
just recorded an interview.

43
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,600
For what?

44
00:04:13,033 --> 00:04:16,753
A program appropriately called<i> Impact.</i>

45
00:04:16,913 --> 00:04:17,913
When will it air?

46
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,560
Tonight, ma'am. Nine o'clock.

47
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,000
<i> Tell
the people. Tell them on television.</i>

48
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,200
<i>Questions in the public mind,
answered by people in the public eye.</i>

49
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,440
<i>This</i> is Impact, <i>the program that examines</i>

50
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,000
<i>the most important matters of the moment</i>

51
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,040
<i>- and brings the debate to you at home.</i>
- Sorry I'm late.

52
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,960
<i> Robin Day puts the questions.</i>

53
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,000
It's just starting.

54
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,920
<i>Tonight, we have a man who,
because of press activity in recent days,</i>

55
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,040
<i>probably needs no introduction,
Lord Altrincham.</i>

56
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,440
<i>In the space of just a few days,</i>

57
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,320
<i>his inflammatory
and deeply personal attacks on the Queen</i>

58
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:14,825

<i>have become the most pressing issue
of the day</i>

60
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,960
<i>and caused something
of a constitutional crisis.</i>

61
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,280
<i>So, I'd like to begin by asking
Lord Altrincham a simple question.</i>

62
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,120
<i>She's our head of state,</i>

63
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,920
<i>loved, respected and admired
throughout the world,</i>

64
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,920
<i>so why do you hate her so very much?</i>

...far too long.

71
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,720
People are beginning to notice,
and that is why the...

72
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,640
And that is why the ending
of doctrinal tests

73
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,000
and the introduction of women priests
is the only viable solution

74
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,560
for saving the Church of England,

75
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,400
an institution that is becoming

76
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,680
increasingly outdated and irrelevant
hour by hour.

77
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,120
Who's got a thousand words
for me on that?

78
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,440
- Hello, Patricia.
- Would anyone like some toffee?

79
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,040
Bring it over here, Patricia darling.

80
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,680
- Oh, divine.
- Much like Patricia herself.

81
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,120
Come, come, my dear. Be seated.

82
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,320
Right. If no one's keen
on the church story,

83
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,560
I can knock something up.

84
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,400
Now, a piece on
reforming the House of Lords.

85
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,640
Dermot, you were going to look at that,
weren't you?

86
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,040
- Something nutty about it?
- Mm, molasses.

87
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,320
And Europe,
we need to work out our official stance.

88
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,800
Are we for or against
a single European market?

89
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,600
Are we in or out?

90
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,080
- Toffee, John?
- Oh, you must try some, John.

91
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,640
I'm afraid I have a thing against toffee.

92
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,920
Why didn't I know that?

93
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,000
You can't know everything about me.

94
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,360
It's not the taste I object to so much.

95
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,280
I just have... painful memories.

96
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:36,360
As a child, I was sitting
in a dentist's chair

97
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,000
because of a piece of toffee I ate.

98
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,880
Mm.

99
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,120
Oh, Lord.

100
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,440
Not again.

101
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,360
Sorry.

102
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,640
I've...

103
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,120
"Perhaps you don't understand

104
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,960
that on your steadfastness
and ability to withstand

105
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,280
the fatigue of dull, repetitive work,

106
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,840
and your great courage in meeting
constant small adversities,

107
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,720
depend, in great measure,
the happiness and prosperity

108
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,720
of the community... as a whole.

109
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,160
The upward course of a nation's history

110
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,000
is due, in the long run,
to the soundness of heart

111
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,760
of its average men and women."

112
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,800
Um...

113
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,840
Working men and women?

114
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,800
It has a touch more dignity, uh...

115
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,520
No, I think "average" is fine.

116
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,520
Thought you might be interested
to see this.

117
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,720
It's a draft of the speech the Queen's
going to give in a week's time.

118
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,720
I don't mind telling you
I felt a bit uneasy about it.

119
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,480
Sir.

120
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,720
Yes?

121
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,280
Sir, forgive me if I'm interfering
beyond my station...

122
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,080
- Tommy.
- Martin.

123
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,000
You were about to interfere
beyond your station.

124
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,091
Uh, it's concerning the speech

125
00:10:48,116 --> 00:10:50,024
the Queen is due to give next week

126
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,320
at the Jaguar car factory.

127
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,800
- What about it?
- I was just... wondering

128
00:10:55,825 --> 00:10:57,145
if you were happy with it.

129
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,480
Well, obviously I'm happy with it,

130
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,800
or I wouldn't have shown it
to Her Majesty

131
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,240
for the approval
which she immediately gave.

132
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,920
- Did the Queen read it?
- She didn't need to.

133
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,160
She merely asked if I was happy.
I replied in the affirmative.

134
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,280
- That was good enough for Her Majesty.
- Hm.

135
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,920
But I can see that
the really important question is,

136
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,800
is it good enough for Colonel Charteris?

137
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,680
You don't think it strikes
the wrong tone?

138
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,680
In which sense?

139
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,440
In its... uh, paternalism.

140
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,520
May I?

141
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,120
Thank you.

142
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,240
I suppose if I had a concern...

143
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,480
it would be that, post-Suez,
in this new climate...

144
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,840
in this new Britain...

145
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,360
the tone of the speech is... somewhat...

146
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,040
Somewhat what?

147
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,720
Old-fashioned.

148
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,800
And would leave her open to attack.

149
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,920
- From whom?
- The newspapers.

150
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,840
People.

151
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,040
If I had a shilling for every time
someone of a progressive

152
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,040
or liberal disposition had warned
needlessly of a popular attack

153
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,400
against the Crown, I'd be a rich man.

154
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,680
The British people adore their sovereign.

155
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,800
It is what constitutes, indeed defines,
being British.

156
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,040
No, the worst I've ever encountered
is, uh, apathy,

157
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,440
where people simply accept
the King or Queen

158
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,680
as they accept the sky above their heads.

159
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,320
But it's a long way
from apathy to insurrection.

160
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,240
Now, as regards the newspapers,
the Crown can count on their support

161
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,880
first, there is nothing to attack.

162
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,480
That's the advantage
of a constitutional monarchy.

163
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,840
They have no power
so there's nothing to complain about.

164
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,160
And even if they wanted to,
they'd always let us know first.

165
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,440
The palace would then
threaten them with a boycott

166
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,360
on the next major royal event,

167
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,440
causing the newspapers immediately
to back down.

168
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,320
Because the very people you fear
will hate the Queen

169
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,280
are the same ones who buy copies
in their millions.

170
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,720
Why? Because they love her.

171
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,120
So I'm worrying unnecessarily?

172
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,207
Martin,

173
00:13:29,232 --> 00:13:34,544
I shall leave the drawing
of that inescapable conclusion to you.

174
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,880
I'm going to take it in
a little shorter, ma'am,

175
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,040
- and rounder at the back.
- Lovely.

176
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,960
Thank you. I... I... like it very much.

177
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,480
Ah.

178
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,080
Thank you.

179
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:13,080
I thought you were hoping
for more children from me.

180
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,920
I am.

181
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,320
Then why on earth would you do
something like that to your hair?

182
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,040
What's wrong with it?

183
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,720
I thought it was tidy and... sensible.

184
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,840
Adjectives to stir the loins.

185
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,320
Apparently it's very à la mode.

186
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,640
All the regimental wives
are wearing their hair like this now.

187
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,800
- Really?
- Yes.

188
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,640
Well, it's certainly very practical.

189
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,560
And should you ever feel compelled
to ride a motorcycle,

190
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,840
it could always double as a helmet.

191
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,560
Well, I like it.

192
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,840
No, I have nothing against it personally.

193
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,960
Stop it.

194
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,000
Sure it will provide ample protection
against any falling masonry.

195
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,400
But... if enlarging the family

196
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,080
and enticing your husband
to procreate is the goal...

197
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,440
It is.

198
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,960
...then you might take a look
at Jayne Mansfield...

199
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,920
or Rita Hayworth.

200
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,240
Ooh, Rita Hayworth.

201
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,040
Sir William Lyons, Your Majesty.

202
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,560
- Welcome, Your Majesty.
- Thank you. Hello.

203
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,760
How do you do?

204
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,000
It's very, uh, spacious.

205
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,200
This is our research
and development area.

206
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,760
Splendid. Now we're talking.

207
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,800
May I introduce you, ma'am,
to Nigel Willoughby?

208
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,320
He sketches all of our prototypes.

209
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,760
You studied drawing, did you?
Lovely. Very good to see it.

210
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,640
- And that's the chassis.
- It is, indeed.

211
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,480
A finished MK-1, Your Majesty.

212
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,440
Ah. It's lovely.

213
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,640
With top speeds
of over 100 miles per hour.

214
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,920
Quite the thing.

215
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I've always been interested
in the red leather.

216
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,520
Is it horse or cow?

217
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,720
Hello.

218
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,760
I wish first to express to you

219
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,200
my very great pleasure
at being here today.

220
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,560
My husband and I
have been most profoundly moved

221
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,520
by your hospitable welcome
and would like you to know

222
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,840
<i>how very grateful we are to you all...</i>

223
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,560
- Thank you.
<i>- ...for the work that you do.</i>

224
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,000
<i>We understand that in the turbulence</i>

225
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,840
of this anxious and active world,

226
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,360
many of you are leading
uneventful, lonely lives...

227
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,040
<i>where dreariness is the enemy.</i>

228
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,520
Perhaps you don't understand
that on your steadfastness and ability

229
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,120
to withstand the fatigue of dull,
repetitive work...

230
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,080
depend, in great measure, the happiness

231
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,600
and prosperity of the community
as a whole.

232
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,240
The upward course of a nation's history

233
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,440
is due, in the long run,

234
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,960
to the soundness of heart
of its average men and women.

235
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,720
<i>May you be proud to remember</i>

236
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,160
<i>how much depends on you,</i>

237
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,920
<i>and that even when your life
seems most monotonous...</i>

238
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:49,880
<i>what you do is always of real value
and importance to your fellow...</i>

239
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,080
Lord Altrincham?

240
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,440
Evening edition! <i>News Chronicle!</i>

241
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,360
Evening edition!

242
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,600
Ah. I need a favor, some typing.

243
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,120
Oh, you're going home.

244
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,960
I don't need to be.

245
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,600
I've just heard a ridiculous speech
by the Queen,

246
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,960
and I want to write
an immediate response.

247
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,560
No, I'll... I'll find someone else.

248
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,520
No, no, it's no trouble.

249
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,080
I had nothing else planned.

250
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,640
Thank you.

251
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,640
- I've had another thought.
- Super.

252
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,040
A rather heretical thought.

253
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,560
I got the idea
from something Walter Bagehot said

254
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,920
about the first duty of royalty
being to inspire.

255
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,080
Hello.

256
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,000
I trust you had a safe journey,
Your Majesty.

257
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,120
- Yes, very lovely.
- Good to be back.

258
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,400
Well, let's hope it brightens up later.

259
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,400
Good shot, ma'am.

260
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,720
<i> National and English</i>
<i>Review! National and English Review!</i>

261
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,240
Thank you. Two shillings
for<i> National and English Review.</i>

262
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,000
Thank you, sir. Morning.

263
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,000
Thank you, madam.

264
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,160
<i>National and English Review.</i>
Two shillings, thank you very much.

265
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:07,000
There we go, sir.
Thank you very much. Two shillings.

266
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,360
I see.

267
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,080
Right.

268
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,560
Well, thank you.

269
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,320
Sorry to disturb, Your Majesty,
Your Royal Highness.

270
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:17,400
Just to say it might be worth
avoiding certain newspapers this morning.

271
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,800
Why? What's your sister done now?

272
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,920
Nothing to do with
Princess Margaret, sir. Uh...

273
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,960
It's an article written
by Lord Altrincham.

274
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,040
Never heard of him. You?

275
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,360
Taken originally
from his own publication...

276
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,560
<i>The National and English Review.</i>

277
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,600
Never heard of that, either.

278
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:45,920
Which several newspapers have chosen
to run, partially or in full.

279
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,760
What kind of article?

280
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:53,520
It's quite a critical article, ma'am.

281
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,320
What gives him the right?

282
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,800
Tell me honestly, Mommy...

283
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,200
is there any part of you
that agrees with him?

284
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,880
Certainly not.

285
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,520
And that's not just your mother
saying that.

286
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,560
The palace press secretary called me
an hour ago to say

287
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,880
the vast majority of the country
not only disagrees with Altrincham

288
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,880
but is disgusted by him.

289
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,040
It's an irrelevant article

290
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,200
written by an irrelevant man
for an irrelevant publication...

291
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,160
only picked up because it's August,
people are on holiday,

292
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,080
government is in recess,
and there's nothing to write about.

293
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,200
Today, 85% of the country is against him.

294
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,560
By tomorrow, it will be 95%.

295
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,400
That man's going to wish
he'd never been born.

296
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,880
- Traitor!
- Coward!

297
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,680
Excuse me!

298
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,720
Excuse me. Thank you.

299
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,120
Excuse me. Excuse me. Thank you.

300
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,520
I asked you to come because
I had a phone call an hour ago

301
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,200
from a television producer,

302
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,280
inviting me to record
an interview this afternoon.

303
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,640
Which program?

304
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,280
<i>Impact.</i> With Robin Day.

305
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,280
I wish it weren't Day.

306
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,000
We all wish it weren't Day,
he's terrifying.

307
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,640
Don't be silly.

308
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,560
The fact that it's Day
is what makes it valuable.

309
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,640
You don't think I'm walking into a trap?

310
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,320
You walked into the trap
when you wrote the article.

311
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,800
Now you're the most unloved individual
in Britain.

312
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:47,200
Ironically, Day is the one person
who could help you.

313
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:51,200
Why?
You've seen how he interviews people.

314
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,600
He dismembers them. Tears them to shreds.

315
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,360
Yes, but keep your cool
under his scrutiny...

316
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:01,720
make your case politely,
respectfully, intelligently.

317
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,440
It could turn people around.

318
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,520
Thank you very much.

319
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,960
- Lord Altrincham. How do you do?
- How do you do?

320
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,120
- Shall we?
- Yes.

321
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,720
This way. Thank you for coming.

322
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,200
Not at all.
How long do we have until we start?

323
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,773
We'll pop into makeup quickly.

324
00:28:31,798 --> 00:28:33,344
We should start in ten minutes.

325
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,160
- Just here, if you will.
- Right.

326
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,000
- Help yourself to water.
- Thank you.

327
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,600
Shouldn't be too long.

328
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,640
- All good?
- All good.

329
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,360
He's standing by, sir.

330
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,920
- And he's prepared?
- Ready as he can be.

331
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,440
Let's make a start.

332
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,960
You've been told how all this works?

333
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,080
Recording now, transmission tonight?

334
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,000
- Stand by, studio.
- Yes. Thank you.

335
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,560
Five, four, three...

336
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,200
Tonight, we have a man who,

337
00:29:16,225 --> 00:29:18,184
because of press activity in recent days,

338
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,800
probably needs no introduction.
Lord Altrincham.

339
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,560
In the space of just a few days,

340
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,240
his inflammatory
and deeply personal attacks on the Queen,

341
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,680
in a periodical of which
he is also publisher,

342
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,920
have become the most pressing issue
of the day

343
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,760
and caused something
of a constitutional crisis.

344
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,680
So, I'd like to begin by asking
Lord Altrincham a simple question.

345
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,880
She's our head of state,

346
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,320
loved, respected and admired
around the world,

347
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,200
so why do you hate her so very much?

348
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,080
I... I don't.

349
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,760
Then why criticize her like this?

350
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,720
That's like asking
an art critic why he criticizes art.

351
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,480
I'm a passionate monarchist

352
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,600
who believes constitutional monarchy
is Britain's greatest invention.

353
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,320
Do you, indeed?

354
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,200
Yes, I do.
I believe that monarchy provides clarity.

355
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:08,520
A symbolic head of state,
transcending the self-serving interests

356
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,680
of the egocentric
and self-motivated politicians

357
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,840
who go in and out of office,

358
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:18,600
who, as King Lear wonderfully says,
"ebb and flow by the moon."

359
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,440
But when working at its best,

360
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,920
monarchy can rise above such matters
and unify a society.

361
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,640
<i>It can set the tone and become
the embodiment of the nation,</i>

362
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,400
<i>of national character.</i>

363
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,720
<i>But the problem is, at the moment,
it's... It's not doing that.</i>

364
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,280
It's doing very little right,
as far as you're concerned.

365
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,720
No, that's not true.

366
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:39,080
You would like to see Her Majesty
endowed with superhuman powers.

367
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,160
It's not superhuman
to be a little spontaneous.

368
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,520
Judging from your article,
you'd like the Queen to have

369
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,353
the qualities of a wit,

370
00:30:45,378 --> 00:30:49,104
you'd like her to be a better
orator, a TV personality,

371
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,629
in addition to being a diligent,

372
00:30:50,654 --> 00:30:53,504
dutiful and devoted monarch and a mother.

373
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,960
All I'm suggesting is that,
in her public speeches

374
00:30:55,985 --> 00:30:59,625
<i>and in her appearances,
she should be more, uh, natural.</i>

375
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,720
<i>Her style of speaking is, quite frankly,
a pain in the neck.</i>

376
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,000
<i>She sounds strangled.</i>

377
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,080
<i>I had the misfortune of hearing</i>

378
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,280
<i>one of the Queen's speeches
in a dental waiting room recently.</i>

379
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,680
<i>I was horrified</i>

380
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:18,440
<i>by the indifference and inertia
with which the speech was greeted.</i>

381
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,815
<i> But you'd accept that being Queen</i>

382
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,304
<i>and head of the Church of England</i>

383
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,200
<i>is not an easy job or a simple one?
If you'll forgive me,</i>

384
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:29,600
<i>it's arguably a harder job
than editing a small periodical.</i>

385
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:31,098
<i>No, I quite agree. </i>

386
00:31:31,123 --> 00:31:33,889
<i>Her Majesty has a seemingly
impossible task.</i>

387
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,273
<i>She has to be ordinary and extraordinary,</i>

388
00:31:36,298 --> 00:31:38,544
<i>touched by divinity and yet one of us,</i>

389
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:43,880
<i>but being ordinary doesn't have to mean
bland or ineffectual.</i>

390
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,560
<i>Or forgettable.</i>

391
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,120
<i> And against whom do you lay</i>
<i>the main charge? Her courtiers?</i>

392
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,933
<i> Well, in the end, if the court is wrong,</i>

393
00:31:50,958 --> 00:31:52,904
<i> if the setup is wrong,</i>

394
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,760
<i>you have no choice
but to criticize the boss.</i>

395
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,160
<i>The Queen?</i>

396
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,480
<i>Yes, because only the boss
can get rid of the bad servants.</i>

397
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,720
<i>She hires them.</i>

398
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,720
<i>She alone can fire them.</i>

399
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:07,360
<i>Now, they may be bad, I believe
some of them at the moment are.</i>

400
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,200
<i>They're quite dreadful, but it is
her responsibility, it's not theirs,</i>

401
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,280
<i>in the sense that they
are just hired hands.</i>

402
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:17,200
<i>And so the personal attack
on the monarch continues.</i>

403
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,400
<i> Let me just say this.</i>

404
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:23,960
<i>To criticize the monarchy,
to criticize Her Majesty, personally,</i>

405
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,680
<i>gives me no satisfaction.</i>

406
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,440
<i>But we have to remember that,
since the Second World War,</i>

407
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:32,160
<i>since Suez, Britain has changed
beyond recognition.</i>

408
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,360
<i>And yet the monarchy continues
its pre-war routines</i>

409
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,520
<i>as though nothing has happened.</i>

410
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,320
<i>I believe it would serve the Queen
and her courtiers well to remember</i>

411
00:32:40,345 --> 00:32:43,313
<i>that until recently,
monarchies were the rule</i>

412
00:32:43,338 --> 00:32:44,889
<i>and republics the exception,</i>

413
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,800
<i>but today, republics are the rule</i>

414
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,560
<i>and monarchies very much the exception.</i>

415
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,200
<i> Lord Altrincham, I have</i>
<i>to terminate the interview.</i>

416
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,760
<i>I'm obliged to you
for answering my questions.</i>

417
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:02,560
<i>Next week at the same time,</i>
<i>there will be another edition of</i> Impact.

418
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,240
<i>Good night.</i>

419
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,640
That went very well.

420
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:16,440
- Thank you again, Lord Altrincham.
- Thank you. Good day.

421
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,680
Thank you.

422
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,000
I thought he was even scarier
in real life than I, uh...

423
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,760
- Lord Altrincham?
- Yes.

424
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,120
You traitor!

425
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,520
- Is that him? It is, isn't it?
- Well done.

426
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,200
- Congratulations.
- Well done. Well done, sir.

427
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,360
- A glass of white?
- Well done.

428
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,680
Or something stronger?
What about a brandy?

429
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,760
Why not?

430
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,560
Well done.

431
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,000
Humphrey.

432
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,400
Well done. You looked incredibly calm.

433
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,600
- Really?
- Man of the hour. Really.

434
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,840
- Your Majesty.
- Yes, what is it, Michael?

435
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,960
There have been some reactions
in the newspapers

436
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:19,160
to last night's television interview,
and to the assault upon Lord Altrincham.

437
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:22,800
I'm afraid it's not quite as we'd hoped.

438
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,400
Why not?

439
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,840
Uh, well, the man that
struck Altrincham, it turns out,

440
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:36,240
is a member of the extreme right
League of Empire Loyalists,

441
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,987
which is a pressure group that campaigns

442
00:34:39,012 --> 00:34:41,584
against the dissolution of the Empire

443
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,240
and has a clear doctrine
of English racial supremacy.

444
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,120
Oh, dear.

445
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:51,400
And it seems that most people
have decided,

446
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,160
having watched Altrincham
on the television,

447
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,640
that he is eminently reasonable.

448
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:05,280
Now, almost half the country appears
to agree with his sentiments,

449
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,520
and there are new polls to support this.

450
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,960
Letters to the<i> Daily Mirror</i>
are running at four to one

451
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,560
in Altrincham's favor...

452
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:17,600
and even the normally conservative
<i>Daily Mail...</i>

453
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,440
changed its tune this morning.

454
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,920
Um, in addition,

455
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,760
and this, I believe,
reflects on his growing concern

456
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,640
at some of the telephone calls
he has been receiving...

457
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,227
the Prime Minister has suggested

458
00:35:34,252 --> 00:35:36,824
that he come up a week
earlier than planned,

459
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,320
in order to discuss it all
with you in person.

460
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,720
Goodness! A constitutional crisis.

461
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,680
Well, I hope you're going
to apologize to Mr. Macmillan, too.

462
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,600
Ma'am?

463
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,813
You're not going to deny this whole mess

464
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:53,064
springs from a badly written speech

465
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,720
which I gave, unquestioningly,
because I trusted you.

466
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,880
Perhaps Altrincham's right.

467
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,840
Perhaps I should surround myself
with younger, more dynamic people

468
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,520
with one foot in the real world!

469
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,880
Thank you, ma'am.

470
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,080
And you believe it's now
a government matter?

471
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,840
I do, ma'am.

472
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,600
Ambassadors from all around the world
have been calling me, concerned.

473
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,360
Her Majesty will hardly need reminding
a great many other countries

474
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:50,320
have overthrown their monarchies
and become republics in recent years.

475
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:55,840
Egypt, Bulgaria, Italy,
Tunisia only last month.

476
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,360
Of course we're not at that point.
Not at a red light.

477
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:06,000
We're not even at an amber.
But we'd hate it to become amber.

478
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,600
And so, it is my view,
the government's view,

479
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,720
that it would be wise
to contain this as soon as possible.

480
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,120
- And do what?
- The obvious thing.

481
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:21,720
Altrincham is a fire
which needs to be put out.

482
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,440
Got you!

483
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,560
Got you!

484
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:47,920
Got you!

485
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,880
The palace has offered up
a chap called Charteris.

486
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,880
To meet. I looked him up.

487
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,840
He used to be
her principal private secretary.

488
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,040
- Well, there you are.
- Before the King died.

489
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:15,880
- When she was princess.
- And now?

490
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:22,440
He's assistant private secretary,
so not quite a pawn,

491
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,880
but certainly not a bishop
or knight, either.

492
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,160
Go.

493
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,760
Go, in order to be fobbed off?

494
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,720
Go in the spirit of openness
and wanting to work together.

495
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,840
If they wanted to work together,

496
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,480
- they would have sent someone higher up.
- Go.

497
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
All right.

498
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,720
And take a list of suggestions.
Recommendations.

499
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,720
Don't go empty-handed.

500
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,200
Not yet! John!

501
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,040
Your tooth! John!

502
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:56,920
Sorry.

503
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,760
- Do you have a comment, sir?
- Sorry.

504
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,040
Lord Altrincham!

505
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,600
Lord Altrincham?

506
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,280
- Yes.
- This way, please.

507
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,160
Good to know I'm seeing the top man.

508
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,520
In one sense.

509
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,960
Here we are, Lord Altrincham.

510
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,200
Colonel Charteris
will be with you shortly.

511
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,320
- Thank you.
- Sir.

512
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:15,000
I see we have something in common.

513
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,160
And what would that be?

514
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,800
Your Majesty.

515
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:33,080
I was referring
to the photos of Eton and Sandhurst.

516
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:36,120
Hm. Which you attended too, I gather.

517
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,640
Yes.

518
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,800
Going on to become
an Officer of the Guards

519
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:43,560
at both St James's Palace
and Windsor Castle.

520
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,360
It doesn't quite fit the profile
of a revolutionary.

521
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,800
It's the assumption everyone has made.

522
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,600
Because I dare offer an opinion,
I must be trying to burn the temple down.

523
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:58,680
On the contrary,
I'm trying to make sure it survives.

524
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,160
Well, those of us in the temple
are very much looking forward

525
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,960
to hearing what it is we must do
in order to survive.

526
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,760
Shall we begin?

527
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:15,440
Is my voice all right?
You can understand me?

528
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,840
- Yes.
- Not too strangled?

529
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,280
Not too much a pain in the neck?

530
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,680
- No.
- Good.

531
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,840
So, what is it that you'd have me change?

532
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,600
It's not so much
what I'd have<i> you</i> change,

533
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,960
just an acknowledgment
that<i> it</i> has changed.

534
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,040
- What?
- Everything.

535
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:44,200
And to prepare yourself for the fact
we now live in a time where...

536
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,640
people like me...

537
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,760
- Can say exactly what they think.
- Yes.

538
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,640
- In any way they want.
- Yes.

539
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,960
And, remind me, why is that, exactly?

540
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,760
Because the age of deference is over.

541
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,920
And what is left without deference?

542
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,320
Anarchy?

543
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,720
Equality.

544
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,040
How can it be equality
when I cannot return the fire?

545
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,440
You can.

546
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,360
But I struggle to think of a moment
in history where it has worked

547
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:20,520
to a monarch's advantage
to return fire on their own people.

548
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:24,080
But you have managed to think
of how this monarch

549
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,520
might do something to her advantage.

550
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,440
I have.

551
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:31,040
And that same monarch
is sitting before, forgive me...

552
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:37,160
a failed politician
and an unrecognized journalist...

553
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:40,960
and taking his advice
on how to do her job.

554
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:45,800
The situation is as baffling to me
as it is to you, Your Majesty.

555
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:03,640
- Ah. You've got a list.
- I do.

556
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:08,760
As you might know from my article,
I made a series of observations,

557
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,387
recommendations of things to change, but

558
00:44:11,412 --> 00:44:13,064
for the purposes of this meeting,

559
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:17,160
I chose to limit those recommendations
to, um, six.

560
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,200
Six?

561
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:23,760
Three things to start
and three things to stop.

562
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:28,120
- Well, let's start with the "stops."
- Very well.

563
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:33,240
Ah, yes. Putting an end
to the debutantes' ball.

564
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:39,080
The idea that young women of a certain
class are presented to the sovereign,

565
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,960
and women who are not of that class
are not presented to the sovereign

566
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,680
and somehow not acceptable.

567
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,040
This is the sort of inequity
that should have died out

568
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:50,880
with our grandparents' generation,
certainly after the war.

569
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,406
Next.

570
00:44:59,040 --> 00:44:59,967
Uh...

571
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:06,120
Allow divorced people to move more freely
in royal circles.

572
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,160
Why?

573
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,400
The sovereign is head
of the Church of England,

574
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:14,160
and the Church does not recognize
divorced persons.

575
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,520
It's unkind. Discriminatory.

576
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,560
Quite possibly unlawful.

577
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,120
Next.

578
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:25,360
Uh...

579
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:30,240
I would recommend getting rid
of an entire generation of courtier.

580
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,200
The old school, stuck in the past.

581
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:37,480
Ostriches with their heads buried
in the sand.

582
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:41,040
They're stopping the palace evolve
in keeping with the rest of the world.

583
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:46,080
Those "ostriches" provide
an indispensable function of monarchy:

584
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,040
the preservation of tradition.

585
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:54,080
You asked for my recommendations, ma'am.

586
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,720
I'm respectfully passing them on.

587
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,720
What would you have me start?

588
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,880
Open up, ma'am.

589
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:08,400
Lower the drawbridge.

590
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:10,840
Let people get to know you.

591
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,600
I don't wish to be known.

592
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,920
Televise the Christmas speech.

593
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,160
Become more transparent, accessible.

594
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,800
- And finally...
- Oh, finally.

595
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,920
...spend time with normal people.

596
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,920
Not just courtiers
or the great and the good,

597
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,560
but real people, average people.

598
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,080
Working people.

599
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,600
Open the doors.

600
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:42,720
Make it more inclusive and egalitarian.

601
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:47,720
Let normal people get to know you, too.

602
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,520
Would you mind stepping out
into the corridor for a moment?

603
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,880
Not at all.

604
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,600
And would you ask
my private secretary to come in?

605
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:16,600
Of course.

606
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,240
Your Majesty.

607
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,960
Colonel Charteris?

608
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:48,760
Your Majesty.

609
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,840
Lord Altrincham. Please.

610
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:22,240
<i> When I went back</i>
<i>into the room, she was gone.</i>

611
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,960
<i>Vanished into thin air.</i>

612
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,160
Do sit down.

613
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:30,240
Charteris then went on to tell me that

614
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:33,080
no one can ever know
that I met the Queen,

615
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:36,960
and that should I ever claim that I did,
the palace would robustly deny it.

616
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,920
They will, however,
concede that I had an appointment

617
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,400
with Her Majesty's
assistant private secretary,

618
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:49,523
and that concessions might be made
to one or two of my recommendations.

619
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,040
May I ask which ones?

620
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,240
Let's get these lights in.
Quickly. Easy with that camera.

621
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:03,160
Right-o.

622
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,140
This one next.

623
00:49:05,165 --> 00:49:08,064
Well done. Now, let's have
the rest of the cables.

624
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,200
I feel like an actress.

625
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:22,920
A common little showgirl.

626
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,240
Don't be silly.

627
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,360
In what way am I different?

628
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:33,160
Memorizing lines and remembering angles,
wearing makeup?

629
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:36,360
Well, you're the Queen
of the United Kingdom for one thing.

630
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,360
Yes, who's memorizing lines

631
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:40,440
and remembering angles
and wearing makeup.

632
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,120
Your Majesty.

633
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,120
Right.

634
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:58,400
- Where do you want me?
- This way, please, ma'am.

635
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:33,400
Ma'am.

636
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:17,400
Five, four, three...

637
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:22,400
Happy Christmas.

638
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,920
Twenty-five years ago,
my grandfather broadcast

639
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,080
the first of these Christmas messages.

640
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,520
Today is another landmark,

641
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,853
<i>because television has made it possible</i>

642
00:51:37,878 --> 00:51:40,344
<i>for many of you to see me in your homes</i>

643
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,080
<i>on Christmas Day.</i>

644
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:47,120
<i>My own family often gather round
to watch the television,</i>

645
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:51,400
<i>as they are at this moment,
and that is how I think of you all now.</i>

646
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:56,600
I very much hope that this new medium
will make my Christmas message

647
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,720
more personal and direct.

648
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:03,547
It is inevitable

649
00:52:03,572 --> 00:52:07,464
that I should seem a rather
remote figure to many of you,

650
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,040
a successor to the kings
and queens of history,

651
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:16,520
someone whose face may be familiar
in newspapers and films

652
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,680
but who never really touches
your personal lives.

653
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:24,040
But now, at least for a few minutes,

654
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:28,320
I welcome you into the peace
of my own home.

655
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:36,160
That it is possible for some of you
to see me today

656
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:40,360
is just another example of the speed
at which things are changing

657
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,080
all around us.

658
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:50,760
I would like to read a few lines
from<i> Pilgrim's Progress.</i>

659
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:01,880
'"And though, with great difficulty,
I am got hither,

660
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:05,880
yet now I do repent me
of all the trouble I have been at

661
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:07,600
to arrive where I am.

662
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:13,440
My sword I give to him
that shall succeed me in my pilgrimage

663
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:18,320
and my courage and skill
to him that can get it.

664
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:23,680
My marks and scars I carry with me

665
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:29,480
to be a witness for me
that I have fought his battles

666
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:31,800
who now will be my rewarder."

667
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:43,600
I hope that 1958 may bring you
God's blessings

668
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,480
and all the things that you long for.

669
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:52,880
<i>And so I wish you all, young and old,
wherever you may be,</i>

670
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,840
<i>all the fun and enjoyment and peace</i>

671
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:59,240
of a very happy Christmas.

672
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:02,640
And we're off air.

673
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,800
Congratulations, ma'am.

674
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,080
- Ah, hello.
- My, my.

675
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:03,160
You look pretty. I like the dress.

676
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,000
- Thank you.
- And the hair.

677
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:06,400
- Very unregimental.
- Mm, yes.

678
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,287
Tony knew the top person, of course.

679
00:55:08,312 --> 00:55:10,304
The only stylist who could be trusted.

680
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:13,000
Does he have a name, this stylist?

681
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,160
I want to say Victor Gabon,
but that's not quite right.

682
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:17,160
Um...

683
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,080
Vidal Baboon?

684
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,760
- Vidal Baboon?
- Yes, I think.

685
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:23,880
Well, anyway, he talked endlessly
about hair as a geometric art form.

686
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,480
- It looks jolly pretty.
- Thank you.

687
00:55:25,505 --> 00:55:27,453
If you happen to have
a number for this Baboon,

688
00:55:27,478 --> 00:55:29,289
I might pass it on to my wife.

689
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:32,880
Is that appropriate, by the way,
that a red-blooded man

690
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,720
should know the correct hairdresser
for a woman?

691
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,400
There's almost nothing
that's appropriate about Tony,

692
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:40,360
but he's made it his mission in life
to improve me.

693
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:41,320
Mm.

694
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:44,800
- Your very own little Altrincham.
- Yes.

695
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,760
Just rather better in bed, I suspect.

696
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,880
- Oh, dear God.
- Look at them.

697
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,640
- There it is.
- Thank you very much.

698
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,480
Who do you suppose that is?

699
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:06,760
It could be Mr. David
Smith, a car dealer.

700
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:12,520
- And that?
- I believe...

701
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:16,640
that is Harry "The Hammer" Jones.

702
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:19,480
A boxer from the Old Kent Road.

703
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:25,920
Rounding up the numbers,
we have a local restaurateur,

704
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,320
a bus driver,

705
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,240
a bank clerk...

706
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,120
and a woman policeman.

707
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:35,640
All to open things up.

708
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:36,560
Yes.

709
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:39,760
Bring us more in line with the real
world. Democratize us.

710
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,240
And so it goes.

711
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:48,800
The stings and bites we suffer
as it slips away.

712
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:52,560
Bit by bit, piece by piece.

713
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:59,680
Our authority, our absolutism,
our divine rights.

714
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:04,160
Ma'am?

715
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,000
The history
of the monarchy in this country

716
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:13,160
is a one-way street of humiliation,
sacrifices and concessions

717
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:14,640
in order to survive.

718
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:18,400
First, the barons came for us,
then the merchants, now the journalists.

719
00:57:18,425 --> 00:57:20,500
Small wonder we make such
a fuss about curtsies,

720
00:57:20,525 --> 00:57:22,129
protocol and precedent.

721
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:23,520
It's all we have left.

722
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:28,400
The last scraps of armor as we go
from ruling to reigning to...

723
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,280
- To what?
- To being nothing at all.

724
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,360
Marionettes.

725
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,720
- Right, gloves on.
- Ah.

726
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:53,000
I told the master of the household
to rotate the guests between courses,

727
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:56,560
so if you get a dud, don't worry,
it'll be 15 minutes at worst.

728
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:18,800
Mr. and Mrs. David Smith.

729
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,920
- Ah, David. Lovely to meet you.
- Ma'am.

730
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,720
- Hello.
- Very nice to meet you.

731
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,800
- Mr. and Mrs. Patel.
- Hello there.

732
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,240
Thank you for coming.

733
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,648
Mr. Harry "The Hammer."

734
00:58:27,673 --> 00:58:29,344
I've heard so much about you.

735
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,840
- Thank you for coming.
- You look absolutely beautiful.

736
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:32,920
Mr. Martin Jones.

737
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,720
- Sergeant Ethel Danmyer.
- Ah, hello there.

738
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:41,240
Such a pleasure to have you here.

739
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:44,080
Oh, here they come, dog-dogs.
There they go.

740
00:58:44,299 --> 00:58:51,509
