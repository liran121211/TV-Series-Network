1
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,919
Unprecedented scenes here,

2
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,148
as photographers from
all over the world...

3
00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:39,719
The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh

4
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,079
hide from the world's eyes...

5
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,919
Rumors of a crisis in the marriage.

6
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,799
Now the eyes of the world turn
towards the Royal Yacht...

7
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,035
Intense speculation about relations

8
00:00:48,036 --> 00:00:50,682
between Her Majesty the Queen
and the Duke of Edinburgh.

9
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,479
Right.

10
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,920
No, no, no. I see.

11
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,960
Yes. Thank you.

12
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,560
That was the palace press secretary.

13
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,600
In his view, the steps that we've
taken haven't quite done the trick.

14
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,520
The rumors still haven't gone away.

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,600
I think we both agree, it
can't go on like this.

16
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,759
So I thought we might
take this opportunity,

17
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,400
without children, without distraction...

18
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,920
to lay our cards on the table...

19
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,280
and talk frankly, for once...

20
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,360
about what needs to change
to make this marriage work.

21
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,840
All right. Who goes first?

22
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,519
Stupid question.

23
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,803
If I've learned one thing by
now, it's that I go second.

24
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,560
If I am to go first,
that's where I'd start.

25
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,959
Your complaining.

26
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,839
- My complaining?
- It's incessant.

27
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,759
Whining and whingeing like a child.

28
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,920
Are you surprised?

29
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,875
The way those god-awful mustaches

30
00:02:43,876 --> 00:02:45,879
that run the palace
continue to infantilize me.

31
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,353
If you weren't behaving
like an infant...

32
00:02:47,354 --> 00:02:48,959
Giving me lists, sending
me instructions.

33
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,519
Can you imagine anything
more humiliating?

34
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,680
Yes. As a matter of fact, I can.

35
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,359
I've learned more about
humiliation in the last few weeks

36
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,120
than I hoped I would in a lifetime.

37
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,000
I've never felt more alone than
I have in the past five months.

38
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,920
And why do you think that was?

39
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,839
- Because of your behavior.
- Because you sent me away.

40
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,283
Yes, and why do you think that was?

41
00:03:12,284 --> 00:03:14,200
I don't know, Elizabeth. You tell me.

42
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,639
Because you're lost.

43
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,800
You're lost in your role, and
you're lost in yourself.

44
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,680
Look...

45
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,296
I realize this marriage has turned out

46
00:03:30,297 --> 00:03:31,599
to be something quite different

47
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,760
- to what we both imagined.
- Understatement.

48
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,280
And that we find ourselves in a...

49
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,360
Prison?

50
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,640
A situation... which is unique.

51
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,079
The exit route which is
open to everyone else...

52
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,219
Divorce.

53
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,919
Yes... divorce.

54
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,680
It's not an option for us.

55
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,640
Ever.

56
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,360
No.

57
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,040
So, what would make it easier on you?

58
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,480
To be in... not out.

59
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,960
What will it take?

60
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,280
You're asking my price?

61
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,560
I'm asking... what it will take.

62
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,279
Remind me. You fly first to?

63
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,039
- Gibraltar.
- Ah.

64
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,319
- And from there?
- Entebbe. Then Mombasa.

65
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,799
- Ah, yes. To meet the Royal Yacht.
- Yes.

66
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,279
- I've told you this already.
- Maybe I've forgotten.

67
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,120
Maybe you should listen a little
more carefully next time.

68
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,000
From there we sail to Port Victoria.
Then on to Colombo, New Guinea.

69
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,680
Then Australia.

70
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,520
- Yes. To open the Olympics.
- As instructed.

71
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:31,999
Then Gambia, Gibraltar again,
and finally, uh, Lisbon.

72
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,080
Goodness me.

73
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,600
Five months.

74
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,440
Ugh.

75
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,559
- Thank you.
- What for?

76
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,840
For doing the tour...

77
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,520
stepping into my shoes.

78
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,880
It is important.

79
00:06:48,773 --> 00:06:50,303
Actually, now I've made the decision,

80
00:06:50,304 --> 00:06:52,083
I'm rather looking forward to it.

81
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,319
And, we've managed to add
another leg to the journey.

82
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:01,239
- The South Pacific. And the Antarctic.
- Boys will be boys.

83
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,079
Excuse me. Sub-zero temperatures.

84
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,040
Men will be men.

85
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,470
<i>The annual presentation party</i>

86
00:07:11,471 --> 00:07:13,763
<i>for members of the diplomatic corps.</i>

87
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,159
- Do you remember last year?
- Yes, I do, unfortunately.

88
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,999
- It did go on rather.
- Five hours.

89
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,119
- One moment, Your Majesty.
- Oh, dear.

90
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,400
The last guests are just arriving.

91
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,760
You look nice.

92
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,880
Do I?

93
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,120
Even in full battle dress?

94
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,879
That stuff used to wear
you. Now you wear it.

95
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,680
Oh, dear. It's all right,
it's all right. I'll do it.

96
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,760
- What is it?
- Zip.

97
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,399
Everybody turn around, please.

98
00:07:55,407 --> 00:07:56,607
Stop it!

99
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,640
Ready for you now, ma'am.

100
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,000
<i>My fellow Egyptians.</i>

101
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,189
<i>The Suez Canal, which flows through</i>

102
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,603
<i>our country like a major artery...</i>

103
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,240
<i>was built by our fathers
and grandfathers</i>

104
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,799
<i>and belongs to us!</i>

105
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,612
<i>But the company</i>

106
00:08:36,613 --> 00:08:38,839
<i>that purportedly owns this canal</i>

107
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,400
<i>is British and French.</i>

108
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,000
<i>Well, I say they do not own it.</i>

109
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,040
<i>They stole it.</i>

110
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:55,280
<i>I imagined I had seen
Ferdinand de Lesseps...</i>

111
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,119
That's the code word.

112
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,999
Ferdinand de Lesseps.

113
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,800
Ferdinand de Lesseps...

114
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:12,440
<i>the engineer who built
the canal in 1869...</i>

115
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,479
<i>We have fought for years to eliminate</i>

116
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,279
<i>the odious effects of the past</i>

117
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,119
of the colonialism and despotism...

118
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,759
Excuse me. What the devil
do you think you're doing?

119
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,400
- Which have ruled us for centuries!
- Take your hands...

120
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,640
Tonight, fellow countrymen,
I am proud to inform you...

121
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,120
Gentlemen. Your hands
above your heads, please!

122
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,319
We have taken back the Suez Canal!

123
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,039
It is now in Egyptian hands.

124
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,840
And it will be run by Egyptians!

125
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,720
<i>Because today our time has come...</i>

126
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:07,839
<i>for freedom from colonial oppressors!</i>

127
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,719
<i>Freedom from colonial thieves!</i>

128
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,560
<i>Freedom!</i>

129
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,840
- Oh.
- Oh, what?

130
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,160
- I've woken up in this bed.
- Yes, you have.

131
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,400
- Where do you get your energy from?
- Oh, I don't know.

132
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,840
I am going to miss you.

133
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,239
Come back to bed.

134
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,200
No, I can't, darling. I've
got 20 star jumps to do.

135
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,120
You can do them here.

136
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,120
- Can I?
- Mm-hm.

137
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,519
Oh, well, why not?

138
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,199
- No! No!
- No, no!

139
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,999
- Out! Out!
- Sorry, sir.

140
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,959
- Thank you.
- Out, everyone.

141
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,439
Right. My car or yours? Or
is that a stupid question?

142
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,120
- It's a stupid question.
- All right.

143
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,479
Heads or tails to see who drives back.

144
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,919
- Whoop.
- Tails.

145
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,040
Heads. Your wife. You lose.

146
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,640
Now, now.

147
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,119
She and I are getting on
rather well at the moment.

148
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,800
- Oh, really?
- Yes, really.

149
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,720
Wish I could say the same.

150
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,479
<i>We're very fortunate to have
a former pupil, and now</i>

151
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,640
Prime Minister, come to say a
few words to us this morning.

152
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,840
Sir Anthony.

153
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,840
Thank you, Sir Claude.

154
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,799
Now there's been a lot of talk recently

155
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,360
about how much the world has
changed since the war...

156
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,680
and how much society in
Britain has changed...

157
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,279
or how much it jolly
well ought to change.

158
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,959
And that places like Eton
should no longer be seen

159
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,240
as the birthplace of Britain's leaders.

160
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:11,399
To which I, as a fully
paid up egalitarian

161
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,000
and progressive member of the
Conservative Party say...

162
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,559
what a lot of absolute nonsense.

163
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,000
<i>If Britain's leaders
aren't coming from Eton,</i>

164
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,039
then where should they be coming from?

165
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:34,279
You see before you the 16th
Etonian Prime Minister.

166
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,560
Sixteen... out of 40.

167
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,079
Not a bad percentage.

168
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,639
Harrow, incidentally,
only accounts for seven.

169
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,039
<i>Well, yes, you might well
argue that as a social pool,</i>

170
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,680
<i>it is a bit narrow.</i>

171
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,920
But narrowness at the top is
not necessarily a bad thing.

172
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,800
<i>For as any serviceman will tell you,</i>

173
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,600
in battle,

174
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,000
<i>when the heat is on,
one needs a shorthand,</i>

175
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,400
a shared language and understanding.

176
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,920
A clarity.

177
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:16,200
Eton has, for generations now,
provided Britain with that clarity.

178
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,440
That code.

179
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:24,440
That... shared language.

180
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,319
Sir, Nasser has seized
control of the Suez Canal

181
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,640
and taken command of
the company's offices.

182
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,799
I'm afraid we shall have to
leave it there, gentlemen.

183
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,040
Provost.

184
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,159
- You asked to see me, ma'am?
- Ah.

185
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,159
Yes, I wanted to leave
this letter and this gift

186
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,899
somewhere that the Duke of
Edinburgh might find it.

187
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,896
Preferably on the airplane. I
thought perhaps in his luggage?

188
00:15:11,897 --> 00:15:13,879
That travels separately.

189
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,279
I would suggest placing
it inside his briefcase.

190
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,519
Yes. Of course. Well, just let
me know when the coast is clear.

191
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,359
Actually, now, ma'am. He has an
appointment with his tailor,

192
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,680
followed by the lunch club
with Commander Parker.

193
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,880
Yes. It's Thursday. Of course.

194
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,560
Ma'am.

195
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,000
Boot polish, binoculars, rifle
and ammunition as well.

196
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,880
Ma'am.

197
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,440
Ma'am.

198
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,960
Ah.

199
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,199
Your Majesty. We've just had
a call from Downing Street.

200
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,720
The Prime Minister has
asked to see you urgently.

201
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,199
So sorry to have kept you waiting.

202
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,440
Your Majesty.

203
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,286
Late last night,

204
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:39,439
President Nasser's men
stormed the offices

205
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,519
of the Suez Canal Company and have now

206
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,643
seized control of the canal.

207
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,879
He claims to be doing this on
behalf of the Egyptian people.

208
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,640
In reality, it is the act of a thief.

209
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,280
A petty hoodlum, showing off for
the benefit of the Soviets.

210
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,080
But we've dealt with worse.

211
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,800
Appropriate measures are
being put in place.

212
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,680
We will simply pay the
pilots to leave their posts.

213
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,400
- Pilots?
- Suez Canal pilots, ma'am.

214
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,399
Highly-skilled mariners,
British and French,

215
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,750
who take the helm of any ship entering

216
00:18:22,751 --> 00:18:24,799
the canal to ensure its safe passage

217
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,319
through extremely challenging
and narrow waterways.

218
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,679
Ah. I see.

219
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,000
The Egyptians are not
a seafaring people.

220
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,600
They don't have the skills,
and they don't have the men.

221
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,839
Taking the pilots away will
simply paralyze the canal.

222
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,320
And it won't be long before...

223
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:48,520
President Nasser will come
back repentant and humiliated.

224
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,680
If you say so.

225
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,960
I do, ma'am. Hm.

226
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,960
It's a hell of a gamble.
I hope you told him so.

227
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,960
- What?
- The Prime Minister.

228
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,720
Yes.

229
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,480
Pulling the pilots out
of the Suez Canal.

230
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,520
How do you know he even intends to?

231
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,359
Aha.

232
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,879
Oh, no, don't tell me.
Contacts from your lunch club.

233
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,079
No need to say it like that.

234
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,079
Well, information like that could
only have come from inside Cabinet.

235
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,999
Or high up in the Foreign Office.
Or the intelligence services.

236
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,320
Our members come from
all corners, darling.

237
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,879
Well, I'm not entirely persuaded
that this club is a good thing.

238
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,040
It keeps me busy. Keeps me informed.

239
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,080
It keeps me sane.

240
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,399
It's a very good thing.
Would you like to know

241
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,231
why navigating the
canal is so difficult?

242
00:19:55,232 --> 00:19:56,359
Perhaps another time.

243
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,399
People think it's just
the water pressure,

244
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,999
but hydraulics are only the half of it.

245
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,440
The canal is narrow. The ships
are vast, great big things.

246
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,439
Uh, the tide is diurnal one
end, seasonal at the other.

247
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,510
So the wind whips in off the desert,

248
00:20:10,511 --> 00:20:12,399
your bow's always to the weather bank.

249
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,678
The pilots have to track a steady course

250
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:17,083
for the best part of a hundred miles.

251
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,960
Excuse me. What are you
doing? Put them back.

252
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,480
Sir.

253
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,160
They're my tankers.

254
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,240
I mean, it takes them seven
years to learn how to do it.

255
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,480
- Where are you going?
- I'm tired.

256
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,880
It's our last night in five months.

257
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,240
A bit more. A bit more. All right.

258
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,040
Michael, what's that?

259
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,960
- DC-4.
- Good man.

260
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,480
You know we will be separated
for Christmas again.

261
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,959
I know. Not ideal.

262
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,000
And your daughter's birthday. Again.

263
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,399
I'll call this time. I won't forget.

264
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,960
And our anniversary. Again.

265
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,760
What do you want me to say, Eileen?

266
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,199
You were as excited as I was
when Philip offered me this job.

267
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,619
You thought it would be good
for me, good for all of us.

268
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,080
I didn't expect the job
to become your life.

269
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,440
When I get back, I will make
it up to you. I promise.

270
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,400
Bye, Dad!

271
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,320
Goodbye, Daddy! Bye!

272
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,400
Bye!

273
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,560
- Ah. Hello.
- Your Majesty.

274
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,560
- Welcome aboard, sir.
- Hello.

275
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Good to see you.

276
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,040
Right, well. I suppose we'd
better say goodbye properly.

277
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,640
Charles.

278
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,840
Hm.

279
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,920
We're not in front of the
cameras now, are we, Charles?

280
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,400
No.

281
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,440
Come here.

282
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,919
Be a good boy.

283
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,080
- Look after your sister.
- Yes, I will.

284
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,200
Kiss.

285
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,120
Come on, darling.

286
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,800
- When you're ready, sir.
- Thank you.

287
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,320
Right, well, uh...

288
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,520
We won't keep you.

289
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,520
Have a safe journey.

290
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,520
- Are you all right?
- Splendid.

291
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,039
I tell you, the idiot that came
up with the idea of marriage

292
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,920
has a lot to answer for.

293
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,320
Well, you know what they say...

294
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,720
"Marriage is a wonderful
institution," but let's face it,

295
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,920
who wants to live in an institution?

296
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,639
<i>Assalamu alaikum.</i>

297
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,320
President Nasser. A
pleasure to meet you.

298
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,640
Thank you, Lieutenant. The
pleasure is all mine.

299
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,843
<i>In the wake of President
Nasser's seizure</i>

300
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:13,159
<i>of the Suez Canal,</i>

301
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,199
<i>Russian mariners have
been pouring into Egypt.</i>

302
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:20,159
<i>These Soviet master seamen are

303
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,599
<i>who are proving to be more adept

<i>have been dashed.</i>

307
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,679
<i>Britain now finds herself at

308
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,159

309
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,399
<i>And with only six weeks of oil reserves,</i>

310
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,239
<i>in an increasingly desperate
situation at home.</i>

311
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,199
<i>The United States is refusing</i>

312
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,683

313
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,919
<i>But with the Soviet Union

314
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,199
<i>commentators are calling this the
most serious international crisis</i>

315
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,080
<i>the world has faced since

316
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,400
Yes, yes.

317
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,800
- Yes.
- The Chancellor, sir.

318
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,160
Harold.

319
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:08,084
I'm afraid that, uh,

320
00:26:08,085 --> 00:26:11,759
"when sorrows come, they
come not single spies..."

321
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,680
- "...but in battalions."
- Indeed.

322
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,492
As the world now knows,

323
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:21,239
Nasser's ragtag collection
of part-time pilots

324
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:26,199
have somehow managed to
retain control of the canal.

325
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,599
And to make matters worse,

326
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,963
it seems they've been
helped by the Russians.

327
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,719
If they get away with this, we
will be a complete laughing stock.

328
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:40,199
Nasser will be able to close
the canal at any time

329
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,640
and cut us off from the oil on
which we absolutely depend.

330
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,240
We must, um...

331
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,280
We must attack.

332
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:54,159
We have no alternative. We must
attack. Swiftly and decisively.

333
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,480
We must restore the status quo.

334
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,760
What do you say?

335
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,600
I say it's the right thing...

336
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,520
for the country...

337
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,440
and for you, personally...

338
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,360
to finally step out from
Winston's long shadow.

339
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,440
"Take but degree away...

340
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,480
untune that string..."

341
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,840
"and, hark, what discord follows."

342
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,800
<i>Military action!</i>

343
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,919
Military action!

344
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:47,319
There is only one proven
way to deal with fascists.

345
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,199
Hear, hear!

346
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,319
And while I'm sure...

347
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:54,239
While I'm sure we all commend our
Prime Minister's confidence,

348
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,639
he seems to forget that there
can be no military action

349
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,839
without support from the UN.

350
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,400
Support we do not have.

351
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,960
We cannot go to war alone.

352
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,080
Ah. Don't you look smart?

353
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,000
- You've got your presents?
- Yes.

354
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,479
Mommy was hoping to come with you,

355
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,219
but I've got very behind.

356
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,599
So, could you send my apologies

357
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,200
- to Mrs. Parker?
- Of course, ma'am.

358
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,520
Enjoy yourselves. Mm?

359
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,120
And be good!

360
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,320
Who wants to play I Spy in the car?

361
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,840
Come here, you.

362
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,959
There you are!

363
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,159
Pow, pow, pow, pow!

364
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,559
Pow, pow, pow!

365
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,959
Daddy!

366
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,120
- Is that Daddy? Shall we speak to him?
- Yes!

367
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,600
Hello?

368
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,480
Uh, no. Seven o'clock will be fine.

369
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,840
Thank you.

370
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,920
It wasn't Daddy.

371
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,439
I'm sure he'll call later, all right?

372
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,479
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

373
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,319

- Why didn't Daddy telephone?
- I don't know.

378
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,240
He must be very busy.

379
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,240
He loves you very much.

380
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,160
Right?

381
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,920
Go to sleep now.

382
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,600
Good girl.

383
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,400
Hello?

384
00:31:09,866 --> 00:31:11,425
<i>Would you like to know the principal,</i>

385
00:31:11,426 --> 00:31:12,839
<i>perhaps only, advantage</i>

386
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,960
<i>of being the Chief Patron of the
English Bowling Association?</i>

387
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,200
Go on.

388
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:27,159
<i>My fellow patrons are frequently
too old or too ill to meet.</i>

389
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,919
Which means I find myself
unexpectedly free for lunch.

390
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,560
<i>Well, I've just woken up.</i>

391
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,319
- It's 11:30.
<i>- Yes.</i>

392
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,800
I got in at four.

393
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,879
I left strict instructions not
to be disturbed by anyone.

394
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,600
For any reason.

395
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,480
I can see a conspiracy to drive
me insane is well underway.

396
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,279
<i>We started at Mirabelle,</i>

397
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:56,760
and then went to the 400, and then
ended up at Les Ambassadeurs.

398
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,440
Who's "we"?

399
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,080
Just Colin, Johnny, Judy Montagu.

400
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,320
- Margot?
- Hm.

401
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,720
Is it possible that you're still drunk?

402
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,760
Do you know, I think I
might be, slightly.

403
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,880
- You need to be more careful.
- Yes, quite right.

404
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,559
Grain and grape don't mix.

405
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,600
No.

406
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,840
I meant about where you're
seen. And with whom.

407
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,680
You're drinking far
more than you used to.

408
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,080
Why do you think that is?

409
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Because I'm unhappier than I used to be.

410
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,199
And why is that? Because
I am still unmarried.

411
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,080
And why is that? Oh, because you
denied me my perfect match.

412
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,239
That's not fair.

413
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,585
As your sister,

414
00:32:47,586 --> 00:32:49,639
I would have been perfectly
happy for you to marry Peter.

415
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,560
- What?
- It was the Crown that forbade it.

416
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,240
Not to mention the fact
that he was a little old.

417
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,400
- Not really from the right...
- Don't you dare say "background."

418
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,960
Well... I just think it might
have all come back to haunt you.

419
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:08,119
What, did Philip's Nazi sisters
come back to haunt him?

420
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,120
Or his lunatic mother? Or his
womanizing, bankrupt father?

421
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,480
How is he?

422
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,920
- Philip?
- Yes.

423
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,280
He's fine. I think.

424
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,160
What, you don't know?

425
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,600
Where is he now?

426
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,120
Ceylon.

427
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,639
- No, Malaya.
- You don't know that either.

428
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,760
No.

429
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,560
- Is that bad?
- It's just a little odd.

430
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,480
A little remote. A little chilly.

431
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:59,160
- Doesn't he write to you?
- Hm. He's not much of a writer.

432
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,240
Neither of us is.

433
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,319
Mike telephoned from Mombasa

434
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,600
- to say that they'd arrived safely.
- Who's Mike?

435
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,640
His private secretary.

436
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,360
- Oh, yes. That little Australian.
- Yes.

437
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,480
- What do you make of him?
- I'm not sure I make anything of him.

438
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,600
He's Mike.

439
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,120
We were all very close in Malta.

440
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,880
The children sometimes
play together now.

441
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,439
Philip says he'd be lost without him.

442
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,480
Oh, just as long as he
isn't lost because of him.

443
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,560
What does that mean?

444
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,359
It means he's got something
of a reputation.

445
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,960
- Who, Mike?
- Yes, Mike.

446
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,599
Isn't he thick as thieves
with that sinister osteopath?

447
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,720
- What osteopath?
- The one who knows everyone.

448
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,000
Always arranging gentlemen's
weekends here and there with...

449
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,680
- actresses and...
- Ballerinas.

450
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,480
Yes.

451
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,560
How did you know that?

452
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,519
<i>I don't mind telling
you, everything else</i>

453
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,319
I've achieved in life:

454
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,880
Viceroy of India,

455
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,359
Supreme Allied Commander
in Southeast Asia,

456
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,680
even First Sea Lord...

457
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,080
all pale by comparison to this.

458
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,879
<i>To match my father</i>

459
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,781
<i>and be Admiral of the Fleet,
really is most satisfying.</i>

460
00:35:29,782 --> 00:35:32,720
- Sir.
- I said we were not to be disturbed.

461
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,160
It's the Minister of State
for Foreign Affairs, sir.

462
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,600
He said it was urgent.

463
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,799
I'm afraid I didn't know
who else to come and see.

464
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,200
Not at all.

465
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,480
Come on up.

466
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,639
- Hello, darling.
- Don't stay up.

467
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,679
Won't be back until late.

468
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,239
Have fun. Where are you off to?

469
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,799
I thought we agreed,
mysteries on both sides.

470
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,679
- We did.
- Then don't ask.

471
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,019
May I present Anthony Nutting?

472
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,719
Minister of State for Foreign Affairs.

473
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,319
- How do you do?
- Lady Mountbatten.

474
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,399
- I entirely approve of foreign affairs.
- Now, now, darling.

475
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,519
Mm, this one's even more
handsome than Eden.

476
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,959
A cabinet of dishes.

477
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,240
- You're very kind.
- How was the fitting, dear?

478
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,959
I'll let you into a secret, Mr. Nutting.

479
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,959
My husband cares for nothing and no one

480
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,120
in quite the same way he
cares for his uniforms.

481
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,759
We're fortunate enough to have
a ballroom in this house.

482
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,120
But is it the largest room here? No.

483
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,280
That's reserved for my
husband's uniforms.

484
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:33,759
One can only ask oneself
what it all compensates for.

485
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,600
I should have thought that was obvious.

486
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:40,479
The gaping wounds left by the
simplest encounter with you, my dear.

487
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,680
Hm.

488
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,680
Shall we?

489
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,443
I'm not saying I condone

490
00:36:45,444 --> 00:36:47,239
how Nasser is behaving, not at all.

491
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,799
The man clearly needs to
be put back in his place.

492
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,639
But my greater concern is that
our Prime Minister's response

493
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,760
to the whole situation is... personal.

494
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,540
Deeply personal, and that he will reach

495
00:36:59,541 --> 00:37:02,039
for the ultimate solution,
armed conflict,

496
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,079
without waiting for an international
coalition to join him.

497
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,080
Today,

498
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,479
<i>a delegation of French government
and intelligence officials</i>

499
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,800
<i>came to Downing Street for secret talks.</i>

500
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,800
Further secret talks are planned
with Israeli officials next week.

501
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,159
So, what have we got today?

502
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,519
Potted shrimp or deviled
crabmeat imperial.

503
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,080
Followed by cassoulets à la jockey club.

504
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,760
Lord Mountbatten, Your Majesty.

505
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,759
Thank you for seeing me.

506
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,159
Well, I've got a
long-standing commitment

507
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,399
at the theater, I'm afraid.

508
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,839
But I thought we'd have an
early supper before I go.

509
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:43,200
Mommy's most put out she
hasn't been invited. Hm.

510
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:49,839
Mm. Under normal circumstances, uh,

511
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:55,576
a mad rush to war might be
explained as a play for legacy.

512
00:37:55,577 --> 00:37:56,599
Mm-hmm.

513
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,719
He was in Winston's shadow for so long,

514
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:03,003
a quick and successful war
might look good on his record.

515
00:38:03,004 --> 00:38:04,632
But in this case,

516
00:38:04,633 --> 00:38:08,883
I think it boils down to an
irrational personal dislike.

517
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:14,159
The two men, he and Nasser,
just hate one another.

518
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,719
And the rest of us are just
getting caught up in it.

519
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,719
What are you suggesting
that I do about it?

520
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,239
You have your weekly private audience

521
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,839
in which the two of you are alone.

522
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:25,199
Observe him carefully.
Listen to him closely.

523
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,840
Read your cabinet minutes... minutely.

524
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,039
Speak your mind.

525
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,199
Yes, well, I'm not really
supposed to do that.

526
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,880
Even if it's in the interests
of national security?

527
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,360
All right. Fine.

528
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,800
I'll keep an eye on him.

529
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,440
Carefully.

530
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,160
Closely.

531
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,040
Minutely.

532
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,800
Thank you for supper.

533
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,319
You... You will let me know, won't you,

534
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,999
when I can take care of all this
and send you someone really good?

535
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
What?

536
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,799
- The food.
- What's wrong with it?

537
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,759
It belongs in a nursery. Everything
that should've been hot was cold.

538
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,479
Everything that should've
been soft was hard.

539
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,119
I've neither noticed or cared.

540
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:14,680
And frankly, Dickie, the
older and grander you get,

541
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,840
the more common you become.

542
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,880
- Have you heard from Philip?
- How's Philip?

543
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,400
No, no, not a word.

544
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,800
- They will be keeping him busy.
- Oh, yes, of course.

545
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,360
You married a wild spirit.

546
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,440
We both did.

547
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,080
Trying to tame them is no use.

548
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:43,239
There were times in India, it
was all right under my nose,

549
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:46,800
with Nehru of all people,
my opposite number.

550
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,920
The humiliation could not
have been more complete.

551
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,919
Of course I considered ending it.

552
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:59,440
And then I imagined how thin
and how poor life would be.

553
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,760
And I realized that when you
really adore someone...

554
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:10,800
as fully and as hopelessly
as I think you and I do...

555
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,600
you put up with anything.

556
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,280
Hm.

557
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,600
What's the play?

558
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,279
Did I say play? I meant ballet.

559
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,840
- Oh.
- Well, I should say Royal Ballet.

560
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,719
We've just given them a charter,
so I really do have to go.

561
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,680
- It's<i> Giselle.</i>
- Oh, isn't that Galina Ulanova?

562
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,719
- Yes.
- Lucky you.

563
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,479
They say she's quite the thing.

564
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,039
- Do they?
- That's what they say.

565
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,040
Hm.

566
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:58,680
They're wondering if you'd like
now to meet Miss Ulanova, ma'am.

567
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,560
No, thank you.

568
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,760
I've prepared some tea.
Would Her Majesty like...?

569
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,680
<i>All my life</i>

570
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,000
<i>I've been a man of peace.</i>

571
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,200
<i>Working for peace,</i>

572
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,960
<i>striving for peace,
negotiating for peace.</i>

573
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:02,760
<i>I could not be other, even if I wished.</i>

574
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:06,279
<i>And even though we are faced</i>

575
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:09,399
<i>with an illegal act of plunder</i>

576
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:13,159
<i>by a dangerous tyrant
in the Middle East,</i>

577
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:17,759
<i>which threatens our livelihood
and that of many nations,</i>

578
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:22,400
<i>I am determined to find
a peaceful solution.</i>

579
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,880
- Your Majesty.
- Prime Minister.

580
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:44,000
- Events are unfolding at great speed.
- Do sit down, Prime Minister.

581
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,480
Ah.

582
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:50,079
In the early hours of this morning,

583
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:54,559
the Israeli army launched an
attack into Egyptian territory,

584
00:45:54,560 --> 00:46:00,279
the Sinai Peninsula, and is rapidly
approaching the Suez Canal.

585
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:04,760
The Egyptian army has
mobilized a retaliatory force

586
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,880
and is about to engage.

587
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:13,159
Her Majesty's government
has now issued a deadline

588
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:16,400
to both Israel and Egypt

589
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:21,799
to halt all acts of war... and to allow

590
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:25,199
Anglo-French forces into the
country to preserve the peace.

591
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,753
The Israelis have
expressed a willingness

592
00:46:27,754 --> 00:46:30,363
to comply if the Egyptians
do, but alas...

593
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,600
President Nasser has thus far refused.

594
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,680
When does the deadline expire?

595
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,320
Tomorrow morning, ma'am.

596
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,679
And the next step, in
your view, would be?

597
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,439
Military intervention, ma'am.

598
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,200
- War?
- Indeed.

599
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:53,240
But to keep the peace.

600
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,720
It is the correct thing to do, ma'am.

601
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:03,640
Nasser is playing roulette with
the stability of the whole world.

602
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:08,160
Well... Thank you for your explanation.

603
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:17,360
Before you go, I do have
one or two questions.

604
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,400
When you mentioned that the
Israelis had launched an attack,

605
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,640
you didn't seem surprised.

606
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,079
Why would I seem surprised?

607
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:33,639
Unless I'm mistaken, the Israeli
position has always been

608
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,370
that they would, under no circumstances,

609
00:47:35,371 --> 00:47:37,923
launch a full-scale attack by themselves

610
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,480
for fear of diplomatic isolation.

611
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,680
And yet they've gone on
to do precisely that,

612
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:47,800
indicating that either
they changed their mind,

613
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:52,800
or... there'd been some
kind of collusion.

614
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,120
Have we?

615
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,040
Have we... what?

616
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,800
Colluded with Israel?

617
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,080
In any way?

618
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,800
Six days ago...

619
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,519
this government met with representatives

620
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:43,160
of the French and Israeli
governments in a small village

621
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,759
on the outskirts of Paris,

622
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,640
where a document was signed.

623
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:52,640
The Sèvres Protocol.

624
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:59,079
Which outlines plans for a
coordinated offensive against Egypt,

625
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:01,390
whereby the Israeli army would attack

626
00:49:01,391 --> 00:49:03,719
the Egyptian army near the Suez Canal,

627
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:07,000
<i>thus allowing the intervention
of Anglo-French forces.</i>

628
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:16,039
Who else knows about this?

629
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:18,160
Individual members of Cabinet.

630
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,680
- Senior members.
- But not Parliament?

631
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:24,120
- No.
- Or the United Nations?

632
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:28,560
When does all this begin?

633
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:33,839
Airstrikes begin tomorrow.

634
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:36,399
- You don't want to give it more time?
- No, ma'am.

635
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:40,640
The right thing to do is to
go in now, and to go in hard.

636
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:43,520
I was right about Mussolini.

637
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,920
I was right about Hitler, and
I am right about this fella.

638
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,320
Do I have your support?

639
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,760
The Prime Minister always has
the sovereign's support.

640
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:25,280
Majesty.

641
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:21,720
Amen.

642
