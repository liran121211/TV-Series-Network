1
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,228
Friends...

2
00:00:24,252 --> 00:00:25,351
Friends...

3
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:33,469
We meet here today
not as Ghanaians, Guineans,

4
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,720
Moroccans, Algerians,

5
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,312
Senegalese or Malians,

6
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,687
but as Africans...

7
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,098
tired of being
disrespected and abused...

8
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,484
...by the corrupt and imperial
powers of the past.

9
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,085
The time has come to
forge new alliances.

10
00:00:54,785 --> 00:00:59,305
Those who understand
the strategic importance of Africa

11
00:01:00,021 --> 00:01:03,701
and are willing to treat us as equals.

12
00:01:04,321 --> 00:01:06,281
Not as subordinates!

13
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,992
And not as slaves!

14
00:01:10,173 --> 00:01:12,173
This is our time.

15
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,450
We must choose our own destiny!

16
00:01:17,822 --> 00:01:19,542
A socialist Africa!

17
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:23,617
For Africans!

18
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:45,980
It's definitely seen better days, ma'am.

19
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:46,817
Mm.

20
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:49,032
We'll send in the foresters at the end
of the season, cut it back.

21
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:51,945
- Yes.
- The old oak, she's still hanging on.

22
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:55,250
- Just about.
- Oh, but she looks so old. Ancient.

23
00:01:55,275 --> 00:01:57,460
Well, she will have
to be felled in due course.

24
00:01:57,582 --> 00:01:59,688
- What a shame.
- Looks like it's set in for the day.

25
00:01:59,712 --> 00:02:01,710
You remember my grandson, Daniel, ma'am?

26
00:02:02,484 --> 00:02:05,023
Yes, of course.
I was at his christening.

27
00:02:05,187 --> 00:02:06,347
That's right.

28
00:02:07,237 --> 00:02:09,968
We ought to head back, ma'am.
Get you out of this rain.

29
00:02:09,993 --> 00:02:11,007
Right.

30
00:02:11,032 --> 00:02:13,492
I'll go get the jump leads;
The engine's packed in.

31
00:02:13,517 --> 00:02:14,837
What, again?

32
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:19,421
- Can I help, ma'am?
- Oh. Thank you.

33
00:02:22,154 --> 00:02:23,968
Pull! Pull!

34
00:02:24,261 --> 00:02:25,901
Oh! Aah!

35
00:02:26,553 --> 00:02:28,713
- Sorry, you all right, ma'am?
- Yes, fine, thank you.

36
00:02:29,335 --> 00:02:30,445
Oh.

37
00:02:47,696 --> 00:02:50,496
The ceremonial guard
awaited Mr. Kennedy's arrival.

38
00:02:50,521 --> 00:02:52,641
It has pleased the French
that he came to Paris

39
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:54,666
before going to Vienna
to meet Mr. Khrushchev...

40
00:02:54,672 --> 00:02:58,752
When is it, do you think,
if one's committed to a life of honesty,

41
00:02:58,832 --> 00:03:01,952
that one must start calling
oneself "middle-aged"?

42
00:03:02,512 --> 00:03:05,752
Oh, stop it. You're still a young girl!

43
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:08,032
I caught sight of myself
in a mirror today.

44
00:03:09,032 --> 00:03:10,432
I looked like an old woman.

45
00:03:10,512 --> 00:03:12,632
You haven't even finished
having children yet.

46
00:03:13,832 --> 00:03:14,832
True.

47
00:03:15,226 --> 00:03:18,912
So, finish your family,
let the first one go to school,

48
00:03:18,992 --> 00:03:21,112
and then let's talk about
being middle-aged.

49
00:03:21,192 --> 00:03:23,672
That won't be middle-aged,
that'll be ancient.

50
00:03:23,752 --> 00:03:25,632
Here he is arriving in Paris...

51
00:03:25,712 --> 00:03:27,592
Oh... no, no!

52
00:03:27,882 --> 00:03:29,882
Oh, not again!

53
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,834
- Mummy! Be careful.
- President...

54
00:03:33,859 --> 00:03:35,499
No, stop it! It's rented.

55
00:03:35,524 --> 00:03:36,524
Mu...

56
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,508
No.

57
00:03:41,352 --> 00:03:42,912
Oh no, yes, you've got it. Well done.

58
00:03:42,992 --> 00:03:45,832
This macaroni and cheese is heavenly.

59
00:03:45,912 --> 00:03:48,265
...to visit the faculty
of medicine in Paris.

60
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,132
This whole weekend has been heavenly.

61
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:51,368
It will be the first meeting...

62
00:03:51,392 --> 00:03:53,062
Sadly, I have to leave in the morning.

63
00:03:53,552 --> 00:03:57,398
- Whatever for?
- They're coming to dinner.

64
00:03:57,789 --> 00:03:58,782
The Kennedys?

65
00:03:58,807 --> 00:04:00,736
After Vienna with
Khrushchev, then Paris,

66
00:04:00,792 --> 00:04:01,992
they're coming to London.

67
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,573
So we're having an informal dinner
at Buckingham Palace.

68
00:04:04,598 --> 00:04:05,827
During the brief stay in Paris...

69
00:04:05,851 --> 00:04:08,851
She's so young. I always
thought she was the same age as you.

70
00:04:08,888 --> 00:04:09,937
She is.

71
00:04:10,272 --> 00:04:12,062
...a banquet at the Élysée Palace.

72
00:04:12,131 --> 00:04:13,651
Oh... No!

73
00:04:14,912 --> 00:04:15,912
Thank you.

74
00:04:18,072 --> 00:04:19,672
Oh, no, look, there she is.

75
00:04:19,752 --> 00:04:21,592
...was talking about the charm
and elegance

76
00:04:21,672 --> 00:04:23,289
of Mr. Kennedy's wife Jackie.

77
00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:26,459
Jackie, in fact, often
stole the picture.

78
00:04:33,287 --> 00:04:35,127
Oh, she is pretty, isn't she?

79
00:04:36,832 --> 00:04:37,921
Yes.

synced and corrected by susinz
*www.addic7ed.com*

81
00:06:38,739 --> 00:06:42,019
One overriding item
on the agenda today, ma'am.

82
00:06:42,257 --> 00:06:43,497
Ghana.

83
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,025
And our continued concern

84
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:47,632
for Nkrumah's growing hostility
to the West.

85
00:06:47,931 --> 00:06:50,091
You feel that he's drifting
from the Commonwealth?

86
00:06:50,265 --> 00:06:52,785
Not so much drifting
as bolting for the door.

87
00:06:52,865 --> 00:06:54,225
Into whose arms?

88
00:06:55,505 --> 00:06:56,825
The Russians', ma'am.

89
00:06:58,021 --> 00:07:00,501
Yesterday,
he received Brezhnev in Accra.

90
00:07:01,345 --> 00:07:02,465
Brezhnev?

91
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,385
The chairman of the Soviet Presidium,

92
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:08,039
who flew to Ghana for talks about
Nkrumah's precious dam project?

93
00:07:08,101 --> 00:07:09,825
- The Volta Dam.
- Yes, ma'am.

94
00:07:10,117 --> 00:07:12,721
But I thought Nkrumah had been talking
to the Americans about that.

95
00:07:12,745 --> 00:07:15,851
He had been,
but Russia sees this as an opportunity

96
00:07:16,221 --> 00:07:18,710
to outbid the Americans,
get a foothold in Africa,

97
00:07:18,789 --> 00:07:20,989
in an attempt to turn
the whole continent red.

98
00:07:22,246 --> 00:07:24,926
Well, shouldn't we ask the Americans
to improve their offer?

99
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,185
I will certainly speak
to President Kennedy

100
00:07:27,265 --> 00:07:29,145
- as soon as he arrives in London.
- Oh, good.

101
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:33,664
- Following his great triumph in Paris.
- Indeed.

102
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,346
I thought de Gaulle didn't care
for Mr. Kennedy.

103
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,665
Oh, he doesn't! Personally
or politically.

104
00:07:38,861 --> 00:07:42,341
- So what turned it all around?
- The First Lady, ma'am.

105
00:07:44,656 --> 00:07:47,305
- Why? What did she do?
- Dazzled le tout Paris.

106
00:07:47,385 --> 00:07:49,705
Had President de Gaulle
eating out of her hand.

107
00:07:50,905 --> 00:07:54,460
- How on earth did she do that?
- By speaking French fluently.

108
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:56,305
Yes, we can all do that.

109
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:59,665
And by debating with local philosophers
and intellectuals

110
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:02,398
until all anti-American sentiment
simply evaporated.

111
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:04,985
I suppose she is pretty.

112
00:08:07,335 --> 00:08:08,585
And they are French.

113
00:08:08,718 --> 00:08:11,665
She's also a formidably bright
woman in her own right,

114
00:08:11,745 --> 00:08:13,266
having studied at the Sorbonne

115
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:16,468
and the prestigious
École Libre des Sciences Politiques.

116
00:08:17,425 --> 00:08:20,625
"The most glamorous and intelligent
woman on earth."

117
00:08:21,305 --> 00:08:23,345
So they say.

118
00:08:25,475 --> 00:08:27,078
And now she's coming to London,

119
00:08:28,117 --> 00:08:29,718
so we'd better put our
best foot forward,

120
00:08:29,745 --> 00:08:31,225
hadn't we, Prime Minister?

121
00:08:31,905 --> 00:08:33,023
Your Majesty.

122
00:08:36,937 --> 00:08:40,345
Always important, I think,
when choosing a gown

123
00:08:40,502 --> 00:08:44,523
is to ask oneself what precisely
one wants to feel when wearing it.

124
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:46,671
Mm.

125
00:08:47,218 --> 00:08:51,185
I just think that one doesn't want
to feel... second best.

126
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:53,443
Quite. Especially if one is very much

127
00:08:53,455 --> 00:08:55,585
the senior of the two individuals.

128
00:08:56,197 --> 00:08:58,945
- Now, now.
- In terms of rank, ma'am, not age.

129
00:09:00,065 --> 00:09:03,185
To that end I have something
quite specific in mind.

130
00:09:03,539 --> 00:09:06,335
Mrs. Kennedy may have dazzled in Paris,

131
00:09:06,563 --> 00:09:08,923
but let's not forget
France is a republic.

132
00:09:10,235 --> 00:09:12,156
This is a monarchy.

133
00:09:13,065 --> 00:09:15,225
And if you've got it, flaunt it, I say.

134
00:09:32,545 --> 00:09:33,973
I had a look at the seating plan for

135
00:09:33,985 --> 00:09:35,585
dinner and I couldn't help noticing...

136
00:09:35,665 --> 00:09:37,745
Breathe in, ma'am.

137
00:09:37,969 --> 00:09:38,889
Just a bit more.

138
00:09:38,914 --> 00:09:40,905
You gave Mrs. Kennedy to Uncle Dickie.

139
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,705
- There.
- Yes, I did. At his request.

140
00:09:43,785 --> 00:09:45,385
He's been badgering me for weeks.

141
00:09:45,465 --> 00:09:47,789
As, incidentally, has
your brother-in-law.

142
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:49,265
- Berthold?
- Yes.

143
00:09:49,345 --> 00:09:50,345
The rascal.

144
00:09:50,425 --> 00:09:53,425
Not to mention our own Prime Minister
and the American ambassador.

145
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,765
Well, well, well.

146
00:09:55,187 --> 00:09:57,512
All desperate to
sit next to the First Lady.

147
00:09:58,947 --> 00:10:00,804
I could let it out a bit, ma'am.

148
00:10:02,385 --> 00:10:05,585
- No.
- What if I'm requesting her too?

149
00:10:05,742 --> 00:10:08,625
- I put you next to Theodora.
- She's my sister.

150
00:10:08,773 --> 00:10:10,705
Yes, whom you haven't seen in years.

151
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:13,785
No, she's still my sister
and this is, oh, you know...

152
00:10:14,054 --> 00:10:15,785
No. I don't know.

153
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,203
Her!

154
00:10:17,665 --> 00:10:21,225
Anyway, in terms of protocol,
isn't it my right, as your husband,

155
00:10:21,305 --> 00:10:23,225
to sit next to the most
senior female there?

156
00:10:23,305 --> 00:10:25,745
It's true. At a state dinner
you could've expected to sit

157
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:29,025
next to the most senior female
guest, but on this occasion,

158
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,231
Downing Street have asked us... begged

159
00:10:31,243 --> 00:10:33,065
us, not to make it a state dinner.

160
00:10:33,145 --> 00:10:34,145
Why?

161
00:10:34,225 --> 00:10:36,225
So as not to put
French noses out of joint.

162
00:10:36,305 --> 00:10:38,425
What's it got to do
with the bloody French?

163
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:41,305
Well, apparently de Gaulle
will resist us joining the EEC

164
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,865
if he thinks we're too
close to the Americans.

165
00:10:43,945 --> 00:10:46,665
- So it's a small, informal dinner.
- Well, fine.

166
00:10:46,745 --> 00:10:49,905
- Then it's a free-for-all seating-wise.
- Yes, I suppose it is.

167
00:10:49,985 --> 00:10:52,425
In which case, I could move
Dickie next to my sister

168
00:10:52,505 --> 00:10:55,305
and put myself next to the First Lady.

169
00:10:55,385 --> 00:10:56,734
If you must.

170
00:10:57,489 --> 00:10:58,809
Oh, well.

171
00:11:00,305 --> 00:11:01,545
I must.

172
00:11:21,185 --> 00:11:22,625
Thank you, gentlemen.

173
00:11:25,325 --> 00:11:26,405
And you!

174
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:37,745
The President and First Lady
are arriving, ma'am.

175
00:11:37,825 --> 00:11:38,825
Oh.

176
00:11:39,545 --> 00:11:41,185
There you are.

177
00:11:51,465 --> 00:11:54,505
Is it possible to think you could be
marginally less excited?

178
00:11:54,585 --> 00:11:55,785
No.

179
00:11:59,305 --> 00:12:00,505
Thank you very much.

180
00:12:00,585 --> 00:12:02,585
Porchey, what on earth is going on?

181
00:12:04,509 --> 00:12:05,869
They've all gone mad.

182
00:12:07,805 --> 00:12:09,132
Here they come!

183
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:20,425
Madam First Lady,
welcome to Buckingham Palace.

184
00:12:20,505 --> 00:12:22,305
- Thank you.
- Mr. President.

185
00:12:22,446 --> 00:12:23,446
Hello.

186
00:12:23,573 --> 00:12:26,053
Her Majesty's waiting for you
in the Blue Drawing Room.

187
00:12:30,425 --> 00:12:32,649
There's a brief
reception before dinner.

188
00:12:32,661 --> 00:12:33,406
Fantastic.

189
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:36,411
It's mass hysteria.
What extraordinary behavior.

190
00:12:36,436 --> 00:12:37,796
Quite extraordinary.

191
00:12:38,419 --> 00:12:39,843
- Ma'am.
- Thank you.

192
00:12:41,183 --> 00:12:42,343
Darling!

193
00:12:43,515 --> 00:12:44,529
For goodness' sake.

194
00:12:44,554 --> 00:12:47,496
- Come on, it's like royalty.
- Oh. Very funny.

195
00:12:58,923 --> 00:13:00,243
Gosh.

196
00:13:00,904 --> 00:13:02,718
President first, President first.

197
00:13:04,438 --> 00:13:05,638
Your Majesty.

198
00:13:06,046 --> 00:13:07,539
- No curtsy.
- No curtsy.

199
00:13:08,203 --> 00:13:11,273
- Mrs. Kennedy.
- Your Grace.

200
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,984
- Your Royal Highness.
- Mrs. Kennedy.

201
00:13:15,665 --> 00:13:17,625
Good evening, Your Royal Majesty.

202
00:13:18,366 --> 00:13:19,446
Oh, dear.

203
00:13:19,773 --> 00:13:21,116
Oh, for goodness' sake.

204
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,580
Mr. President.

205
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,960
- Mr. President.
- Your Grace.

206
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:29,179
- Did they not get the protocol sheet?
- Yes!

207
00:13:29,593 --> 00:13:31,046
He obviously didn't read it.

208
00:13:31,804 --> 00:13:33,976
Yes, well. Shall we?

209
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:35,734
Uh...

210
00:13:35,767 --> 00:13:37,127
Jackie.

211
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,914
- Where do you think she's going?
- Lord knows.

212
00:13:43,421 --> 00:13:46,022
Mrs. Kennedy.
I believe you know our Prime Minister...

213
00:13:46,065 --> 00:13:49,156
I feel like that went wrong
in about 10,000 different ways.

214
00:13:49,323 --> 00:13:51,859
I've seen worse. Though
I'm not sure when.

215
00:13:54,343 --> 00:13:56,148
- Drink?
- Please.

216
00:13:56,906 --> 00:13:59,505
- Sorry, sir.
- Bloody shambles.

217
00:13:59,585 --> 00:14:00,665
Hmm.

218
00:14:12,265 --> 00:14:13,804
My heart goes out to him.

219
00:14:15,078 --> 00:14:16,832
The word is that, behind closed doors

220
00:14:16,844 --> 00:14:18,705
in Vienna, Khrushchev humiliated him,

221
00:14:18,785 --> 00:14:21,718
ran rings round him,
treated him like a little boy.

222
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:24,345
No wonder the Cold War...

223
00:14:34,505 --> 00:14:37,921
Sensuality... We won't go there!

224
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:40,343
No, we won't.

225
00:14:46,425 --> 00:14:49,210
Oh, stop it.

226
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:57,390
- Ah.
- So, how was she?

227
00:14:58,545 --> 00:15:01,105
Oh, terrific. She's divine.

228
00:15:01,453 --> 00:15:03,765
- Is she?
- And frightfully clever.

229
00:15:04,494 --> 00:15:05,494
Yes.

230
00:15:06,816 --> 00:15:07,896
What are you doing?

231
00:15:08,148 --> 00:15:10,281
- She wants a tour of the place.
- Does she?

232
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:13,051
- Well, then I'll do it.
- No, it's all right, she asked me.

233
00:15:13,076 --> 00:15:16,265
No. It's my house. So I'll do it.

234
00:15:21,252 --> 00:15:22,772
Mrs. Kennedy.

235
00:15:24,121 --> 00:15:25,273
Are you OK there?

236
00:15:25,811 --> 00:15:28,771
I hope my wife isn't, uh,
causing too much trouble.

237
00:15:30,719 --> 00:15:34,079
You do know
you're the luckiest man on earth?

238
00:15:36,217 --> 00:15:37,297
Yes.

239
00:15:41,499 --> 00:15:44,259
Although people keep telling me
the same thing.

240
00:15:47,705 --> 00:15:48,825
Sure.

241
00:15:49,545 --> 00:15:50,705
Where are they going?

242
00:15:51,385 --> 00:15:53,505
I've absolutely no idea.

243
00:15:56,025 --> 00:15:57,825
Now, this is the Throne Room.

244
00:15:57,905 --> 00:16:00,406
In the early years
of Queen Victoria's reign,

245
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:02,985
various balls and
concerts were held here,

246
00:16:03,312 --> 00:16:05,745
but now it's principally used
for receptions,

247
00:16:05,825 --> 00:16:08,960
investitures and the taking
of royal wedding photographs.

248
00:16:14,627 --> 00:16:15,718
Shall we?

249
00:16:16,505 --> 00:16:18,476
Now, this is the Picture Gallery.

250
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,905
This is my
great-great-great-great-grandfather,

251
00:16:21,985 --> 00:16:26,265
George III, and he bought
Buckingham House in 1761

252
00:16:26,345 --> 00:16:28,164
for his wife, Queen Charlotte.

253
00:16:28,953 --> 00:16:30,070
Who's this?

254
00:16:30,814 --> 00:16:34,174
Ah. That's one of the Pitts.
The Younger.

255
00:16:35,025 --> 00:16:37,273
Known for something that's always rather

256
00:16:37,285 --> 00:16:39,545
endeared me to him: Crippling shyness.

257
00:16:40,788 --> 00:16:43,668
Apparently, he could barely
look people in the eye.

258
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,044
And yet he became our prime minister.

259
00:16:47,945 --> 00:16:49,465
I quite understand.

260
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,601
I'm also a shy person by nature.

261
00:16:59,964 --> 00:17:02,244
This leads to our private apartments.

262
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:06,492
It's a shortcut.

263
00:17:10,265 --> 00:17:13,093
This is about as private as it gets
in this place.

264
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:15,804
It's where one feels most comfortable.

265
00:17:16,465 --> 00:17:18,225
Oh, I quite understand.

266
00:17:19,142 --> 00:17:21,902
You have to have somewhere to escape to.

267
00:17:22,825 --> 00:17:26,465
I've often wondered how someone
who hates attention as much as I do

268
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,500
ended up in a goldfish bowl
like the White House.

269
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:33,745
But I realize there's actually
a perverse logic

270
00:17:33,825 --> 00:17:36,865
to a cripplingly shy person
ending up in this position.

271
00:17:36,945 --> 00:17:38,804
Oh, you'll have to
explain that one to me.

272
00:17:39,505 --> 00:17:43,025
Well, a shy person will seek out
someone strong to protect them.

273
00:17:44,218 --> 00:17:46,105
Yes. I'm with you so far.

274
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:50,335
And a strong character's often one
who enjoys public life.

275
00:17:50,834 --> 00:17:52,234
Who thrives on it.

276
00:17:53,164 --> 00:17:56,625
And then, before you know it,
the very person you've turned to

277
00:17:56,705 --> 00:18:00,065
in order to protect you
is the very reason you are exposed.

278
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,429
Jack's idea of heaven is a crowd.

279
00:18:05,105 --> 00:18:07,745
Campaigning, fund-raising, speechmaking.

280
00:18:07,825 --> 00:18:09,492
That's when he comes alive.

281
00:18:10,406 --> 00:18:15,025
He'd far sooner speak to 10,000 people
under the glare of spotlights

282
00:18:15,105 --> 00:18:18,545
than be alone... with me.

283
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,830
And what's your idea of heaven?

284
00:18:28,054 --> 00:18:32,085
I like my own company.
And to be alone in the countryside.

285
00:18:32,781 --> 00:18:34,225
And where do you go?

286
00:18:34,484 --> 00:18:37,453
A farm, Glen Ora, about an hour
from Washington.

287
00:18:37,529 --> 00:18:38,781
Maryland?

288
00:18:39,328 --> 00:18:41,398
- Virginia.
- Oh, yes.

289
00:18:44,185 --> 00:18:45,185
Ah.

290
00:18:47,492 --> 00:18:49,000
- Hello, Stuart.
- Ma'am.

291
00:18:49,148 --> 00:18:51,187
- They're eating.
- Yes, ma'am.

292
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,145
Oh, goodness!

293
00:18:53,414 --> 00:18:57,031
- Hello, puppies.
- Hello, what's your name?

294
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,904
Well, that's Sugar.

295
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,601
And these are her puppies.

296
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,425
Come here, come here, little one.

297
00:19:02,505 --> 00:19:04,695
- Whiskey and Sherry.
- Hello.

298
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:08,945
Oh, you're very clever to be cautious.

299
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,945
Oh, it's really one of the great
paradoxes of being in a position

300
00:19:13,025 --> 00:19:15,865
where I have to talk
to a great many people,

301
00:19:16,465 --> 00:19:19,125
but deep down, I'm
happiest with animals.

302
00:19:19,405 --> 00:19:20,695
That makes two of us.

303
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:27,021
I always think my sister
would've made, if not the better,

304
00:19:27,046 --> 00:19:28,695
the more natural First Lady.

305
00:19:28,789 --> 00:19:31,665
Oh, mine too. A born queen.

306
00:19:32,929 --> 00:19:36,225
And the greatest of British queens.
In her own mind, anyway.

307
00:19:40,265 --> 00:19:41,304
Hmm.

308
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:47,828
No, I liked her very much.
And I'd been all set to loathe her.

309
00:19:48,225 --> 00:19:50,465
But in the end, I was utterly charmed.

310
00:19:51,425 --> 00:19:53,025
- It's a timely reminder.
- Of what?

311
00:19:53,156 --> 00:19:56,185
Well, that people are
so rarely what they seem.

312
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:58,371
Well, then I don't know
what Patrick was talking about.

313
00:19:58,425 --> 00:19:59,585
- Patrick?
- Plunket.

314
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:02,145
- I saw him last night at Tartuffe.
- Oh, is that a restaurant?

315
00:20:02,185 --> 00:20:05,185
It's a play, dear.
A very famous French play.

316
00:20:05,265 --> 00:20:06,982
- Oh, I knew that.
- Did you?

317
00:20:07,007 --> 00:20:09,368
- Yes, it's a classic tragedy.
- Farce.

318
00:20:09,425 --> 00:20:11,305
- By Pissarro.
- Molière.

319
00:20:11,385 --> 00:20:13,570
- Oh.
- Pissarro was a painter!

320
00:20:16,265 --> 00:20:18,625
When was the last time you
even went to the theater?

321
00:20:18,921 --> 00:20:20,230
Or a gallery?

322
00:20:20,255 --> 00:20:21,460
Or even read a book?

323
00:20:21,905 --> 00:20:23,248
Oh, you're a savage.

324
00:20:23,273 --> 00:20:24,585
Oh, thank you.

325
00:20:25,094 --> 00:20:26,494
What about Patrick?

326
00:20:27,012 --> 00:20:29,835
Well, Patrick had dinner
at the Radziwills' last week,

327
00:20:30,678 --> 00:20:33,478
where your new best friend, Mrs.
Kennedy, was also a guest.

328
00:20:34,468 --> 00:20:36,705
He called me this morning to
tell me some of the things

329
00:20:36,785 --> 00:20:38,905
he'd overheard her say at dinner.

330
00:20:38,979 --> 00:20:40,398
Oh, what did she say?

331
00:20:40,761 --> 00:20:42,328
You'd have to ask Patrick.

332
00:20:42,945 --> 00:20:45,025
I must say, it did seem a little unkind.

333
00:20:45,757 --> 00:20:48,546
You know how reported speech
gets twisted in the re-telling.

334
00:20:50,254 --> 00:20:52,054
I'm quite sure it was nothing.

335
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:54,265
Don't worry!

336
00:21:01,705 --> 00:21:03,145
General salute!

337
00:21:03,225 --> 00:21:05,929
Present arms!

338
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,531
Shoulder arms!

339
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,859
Order arms!

340
00:21:17,678 --> 00:21:19,478
About turn!

341
00:21:21,937 --> 00:21:23,718
- Patrick.
- Your Majesty.

342
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:26,270
It's so kind of you to come.

343
00:21:28,905 --> 00:21:31,345
- It's really not far.
- Are you still just round the corner?

344
00:21:31,425 --> 00:21:33,132
- At Wellington Barracks?
- I am.

345
00:21:33,468 --> 00:21:35,081
And are you still traveling up
and down the country,

346
00:21:35,105 --> 00:21:37,305
recruiting for all the regiments
from the top schools?

347
00:21:37,385 --> 00:21:39,265
That's me.

348
00:21:41,854 --> 00:21:43,054
I gather...

349
00:21:44,105 --> 00:21:47,554
you saw the First Lady
at dinner recently.

350
00:21:48,095 --> 00:21:50,175
- Who?
- Mrs. Kennedy.

351
00:21:51,515 --> 00:21:52,956
- Margaret mentioned it.
- Did she?

352
00:21:52,981 --> 00:21:54,031
Yes.

353
00:21:56,244 --> 00:21:57,364
So how was that?

354
00:21:58,745 --> 00:22:01,382
Pleasant enough. Uneventful.

355
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:04,617
- You know how it is at the Radziwills'.
- No, I don't.

356
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,789
Well, the food's always good.

357
00:22:06,814 --> 00:22:08,694
Yes, well, I wasn't
asking about the food.

358
00:22:11,381 --> 00:22:13,061
I'd like to know what was said.

359
00:22:15,545 --> 00:22:17,425
Patrick, we grew up together

360
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,125
and we've always had a very frank
and a very open relationship.

361
00:22:21,703 --> 00:22:23,555
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, so...

362
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,578
Let's not break the habit of a lifetime.

363
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:30,385
All right.

364
00:22:32,639 --> 00:22:34,757
What I overheard the First Lady say...

365
00:22:36,109 --> 00:22:38,721
and I should mention,
I was several places along the table.

366
00:22:38,745 --> 00:22:40,385
- It's possible that I misheard.
- Yes.

367
00:22:43,105 --> 00:22:47,025
Was that she found Buckingham Palace

368
00:22:47,105 --> 00:22:49,750
second-rate, dilapidated and sad.

369
00:22:50,429 --> 00:22:52,882
Like a neglected provincial hotel.

370
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:59,039
And that one came away
with a sense of a tired institution

371
00:22:59,465 --> 00:23:01,865
without a place in the modern world.

372
00:23:05,535 --> 00:23:06,775
I see.

373
00:23:14,585 --> 00:23:17,437
And did she have anything
to say about me?

374
00:23:17,819 --> 00:23:19,054
- Oh, Lilibet.
- Patrick!

375
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:21,119
I was at the other end
of the table, I...

376
00:23:27,252 --> 00:23:29,632
But the words I think
I overheard were...

377
00:23:33,567 --> 00:23:36,137
that in our head of state, we had...

378
00:23:36,931 --> 00:23:38,476
a middle-aged woman...

379
00:23:38,958 --> 00:23:44,918
so incurious, unintelligent
and unremarkable...

380
00:23:47,664 --> 00:23:50,825
that Britain's new reduced place
in the world was not a surprise,

381
00:23:50,905 --> 00:23:52,585
but an inevitability.

382
00:24:07,185 --> 00:24:08,304
Well...

383
00:24:11,627 --> 00:24:13,382
We must have her again soon.

384
00:24:53,305 --> 00:24:55,476
Bad news, I'm afraid. Worse than bad.

385
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:57,942
Regarding Nkrumah's Volta Dam project.

386
00:24:57,954 --> 00:25:00,025
President Kennedy's pulled out.

387
00:25:02,188 --> 00:25:03,188
Why?

388
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:05,068
American involvement was conditional

389
00:25:05,148 --> 00:25:07,468
upon Ghana having severed all ties
with the Russians.

390
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:09,845
Turns out Nkrumah was
in Moscow yesterday

391
00:25:09,857 --> 00:25:11,562
to receive the Order of Lenin,

392
00:25:11,587 --> 00:25:12,907
highest military honor.

393
00:25:13,593 --> 00:25:15,593
From Khrushchev himself.

394
00:25:16,407 --> 00:25:18,882
- And what's the next step?
- I wish I knew.

395
00:25:19,028 --> 00:25:20,789
I wish I had an ace up my sleeve.

396
00:25:21,268 --> 00:25:24,148
The way President Kennedy
had his First Lady in Paris?

397
00:25:37,762 --> 00:25:39,162
Why don't you send me?

398
00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:43,809
Where?

399
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:48,268
To Ghana. On what would be seen
as a personal trip.

400
00:25:48,293 --> 00:25:49,348
Absolutely not.

401
00:25:49,373 --> 00:25:51,419
That would be out of
the question, ma'am.

402
00:25:51,431 --> 00:25:52,431
Why?

403
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:55,444
A visit from the Crown to Ghana
would be seen as a huge compliment.

404
00:25:55,468 --> 00:25:56,548
Too great a compliment.

405
00:25:56,628 --> 00:25:59,268
It would be singling out Ghana
as a preferred nation.

406
00:25:59,348 --> 00:26:02,468
And doing so, we risk alienating
Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Tanganyika.

407
00:26:02,548 --> 00:26:05,028
But surely, by singling out Ghana,
that might be just the thing

408
00:26:05,068 --> 00:26:07,548
to keep Nkrumah away from the Russians
and in the Commonwealth.

409
00:26:07,628 --> 00:26:09,268
Perhaps, but as queen,
you cannot be seen

410
00:26:09,308 --> 00:26:11,268
to be engaging
in the dirty business of politics!

411
00:26:11,348 --> 00:26:12,708
But as head of the Commonwealth,

412
00:26:12,788 --> 00:26:14,588
can I not be permitted
just once to defend it?

413
00:26:14,613 --> 00:26:16,015
Your Majesty.

414
00:26:17,131 --> 00:26:20,523
It would be unsafe.
It would be provocative.

415
00:26:21,894 --> 00:26:24,726
It would be, in my view,

416
00:26:25,327 --> 00:26:28,312
a profound misjudgment
to get on that plane.

417
00:26:43,656 --> 00:26:46,820
"The trip is impossible
to justify from any angle.

418
00:26:47,304 --> 00:26:49,068
It is unethical, unconstitutional,

419
00:26:49,148 --> 00:26:51,548
and indefensible that the Queen
should be going at all."

420
00:26:52,934 --> 00:26:55,454
Well, what would you have me do?
Nothing?

421
00:26:55,668 --> 00:26:57,641
I certainly wouldn't have you
get into a chess match

422
00:26:57,665 --> 00:26:59,625
with a wily operator like Nkrumah.

423
00:26:59,955 --> 00:27:01,275
You're just being cynical.

424
00:27:01,456 --> 00:27:02,816
And you're being naive!

425
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:07,108
When you last met him,
Nkrumah was just... Nkrumah.

426
00:27:07,188 --> 00:27:08,824
Now he's The Lion of Africa, playing

427
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:10,668
the Soviets off against the Americans,

428
00:27:10,748 --> 00:27:13,210
and you're a lamb
the lion will have for lunch.

429
00:27:14,851 --> 00:27:16,685
The best thing you can
do is stay at home

430
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,804
and be what you're supposed to be.

431
00:27:18,828 --> 00:27:21,348
- A puppet?
- A constitutional monarch!

432
00:27:21,428 --> 00:27:23,028
- A puppet.
- If you like.

433
00:27:23,841 --> 00:27:27,078
Well, that's the whole point.
I don't like.

434
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,239
Sir? She's here.

435
00:28:31,505 --> 00:28:34,105
Thank you. They're lovely.

436
00:28:42,038 --> 00:28:43,296
Shall we, ma'am?

437
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:47,163
- Stop.
- Stop.

438
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:49,507
Uh, one moment, please, ma'am.

439
00:28:50,414 --> 00:28:51,429
Yes.

440
00:28:51,856 --> 00:28:53,096
Reporters.

441
00:28:55,541 --> 00:28:57,901
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

442
00:29:09,348 --> 00:29:13,601
Your Majesty,
Ghana welcomes you. Humbly.

443
00:29:14,013 --> 00:29:15,013
Yes.

444
00:29:17,228 --> 00:29:19,070
- We're very happy to be here.
- Of course.

445
00:29:20,948 --> 00:29:24,078
Back, back, back, back, back. Back!

446
00:29:26,455 --> 00:29:27,507
Ready?

447
00:29:29,508 --> 00:29:31,788
Thank you, Your Majesty.

448
00:29:33,588 --> 00:29:35,548
Thank you.

449
00:29:35,628 --> 00:29:38,195
Well, you've given him
the photo he wanted.

450
00:29:39,414 --> 00:29:41,668
That'll be on the front page
of every African newspaper,

451
00:29:41,748 --> 00:29:44,218
making every other African leader
choke with jealousy.

452
00:29:44,313 --> 00:29:46,033
Yes, well, as long as it does the trick.

453
00:29:56,119 --> 00:29:59,439
Adeane here. Put him through.

454
00:29:59,992 --> 00:30:01,883
- I have a secure line to Ghana.
- Yes, sir.

455
00:30:03,398 --> 00:30:06,748
I thought he'd agreed
to suspend all contact with the Soviets.

456
00:30:06,828 --> 00:30:08,770
- Apparently not.
- Ready for you, sir.

457
00:30:08,794 --> 00:30:10,531
Gentlemen? Thank you.

458
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:19,687
Thank you.

459
00:30:20,961 --> 00:30:22,046
Out.

460
00:30:22,828 --> 00:30:23,828
Hello?

461
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,550
Your Majesty.

462
00:30:27,726 --> 00:30:28,773
Prime Minister.

463
00:30:29,004 --> 00:30:30,675
I've just received confirmation that

464
00:30:30,687 --> 00:30:32,324
a team of international engineers

465
00:30:32,351 --> 00:30:35,108
has arrived in Ghana to begin
work on Nkrumah's dam.

466
00:30:35,188 --> 00:30:39,308
Well...
I'd say that's good news, isn't it?

467
00:30:39,908 --> 00:30:41,937
We encouraged the Americans
to go back to Nkrumah.

468
00:30:41,962 --> 00:30:43,268
Soviet engineers, ma'am.

469
00:30:44,179 --> 00:30:45,882
It appears Nkrumah has been playing us

470
00:30:45,907 --> 00:30:47,627
all off against one another.

471
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:49,585
- What?
- Leading us a merry dance.

472
00:30:49,908 --> 00:30:51,601
I'm afraid you've been used, ma'am.

473
00:30:52,618 --> 00:30:53,827
Just as we'd feared.

474
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:02,239
Elizabeth! What's happened?

475
00:31:04,824 --> 00:31:06,504
Evening, sir. Martin.

476
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,640
Ah! Ah! Ah!

477
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,280
I wouldn't, if I were you.

478
00:31:11,293 --> 00:31:12,293
Sir?

479
00:31:13,108 --> 00:31:14,562
She's asked to be alone.

480
00:31:16,406 --> 00:31:17,750
She says she's thinking.

481
00:31:59,708 --> 00:32:00,828
Ma'am.

482
00:32:02,618 --> 00:32:03,738
What's going on?

483
00:32:05,434 --> 00:32:06,634
What are you doing?

484
00:32:08,588 --> 00:32:09,668
Elizabeth?

485
00:32:18,646 --> 00:32:20,171
Yes, this is Colonel Charteris.

486
00:32:20,494 --> 00:32:22,492
We have Martin Charteris
on the telephone.

487
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:24,593
A situation is developing in Ghana.

488
00:32:25,642 --> 00:32:26,642
Hello?

489
00:32:45,548 --> 00:32:47,679
What are you doing? Elizabeth?

490
00:32:56,948 --> 00:33:00,268
I think we both understand
the significance of this moment.

491
00:33:01,548 --> 00:33:02,648
Yes.

492
00:33:03,696 --> 00:33:05,835
But do we understand the terms?

493
00:33:09,493 --> 00:33:11,853
They appear to be in some
kind of negotiation.

494
00:33:11,878 --> 00:33:13,878
- What kind of negotiation?
- Get her out of there!

495
00:33:16,583 --> 00:33:17,943
Your Majesty?

496
00:33:22,023 --> 00:33:23,228
Oh, Lord!

497
00:33:23,308 --> 00:33:24,348
What's going on?

498
00:33:29,988 --> 00:33:31,875
He's taken her hand.

499
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:33,279
Two, three, four!

500
00:33:50,268 --> 00:33:51,988
They're... dancing.

501
00:33:53,761 --> 00:33:55,601
Our Queen is dancing, sir.

502
00:33:57,375 --> 00:33:58,507
With an African.

503
00:33:58,587 --> 00:34:01,227
What? Was this agreed?

504
00:34:01,307 --> 00:34:02,387
Was this agreed?

505
00:34:02,467 --> 00:34:04,267
This was definitely not agreed.

506
00:34:04,347 --> 00:34:06,281
- What are they doing?
- What are they doing?

507
00:34:07,707 --> 00:34:08,984
Hard to say.

508
00:34:09,627 --> 00:34:11,307
I believe it's the foxtrot.

509
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:14,190
The foxtrot, sir.

510
00:34:57,028 --> 00:35:00,335
Ladies and gentlemen,
the man I am proud to call

511
00:35:00,668 --> 00:35:02,948
the 35th President of the United States,

512
00:35:03,117 --> 00:35:06,968
but even more proud to call my brother,

513
00:35:07,868 --> 00:35:09,188
John F. Kennedy.

514
00:35:13,748 --> 00:35:15,268
Thank you, Bobby.

515
00:35:20,606 --> 00:35:22,921
What is it to be an American today?

516
00:35:25,137 --> 00:35:28,375
Prosperous, powerful, privileged.

517
00:35:30,072 --> 00:35:31,192
Certainly.

518
00:35:32,232 --> 00:35:35,792
And yet, it is also troubling.

519
00:35:37,028 --> 00:35:41,273
I look around me and find our people
divided as never before.

520
00:35:42,054 --> 00:35:45,188
Indeed, as at no time
since our Civil War.

521
00:35:45,854 --> 00:35:48,894
There has been a change, a slippage,

522
00:35:49,179 --> 00:35:51,820
in our moral
and our intellectual strength.

523
00:35:52,687 --> 00:35:57,257
Blight has descended on
our regulatory agencies and a dry rot,

524
00:35:57,375 --> 00:36:01,515
beginning in Washington,
is seeping into every corner of America.

525
00:36:02,065 --> 00:36:04,406
Too many of us have lost our way,

526
00:36:04,826 --> 00:36:08,306
our will and our sense
of historic purpose.

527
00:36:08,843 --> 00:36:14,228
It is time for a renewal,
a new generation of leadership,

528
00:36:14,437 --> 00:36:17,948
healing leadership,
but we cannot do it alone,

529
00:36:18,226 --> 00:36:23,548
and so I am asking each of you
to be pioneers in this renewal,

530
00:36:23,628 --> 00:36:28,187
in this healing, in the reclaiming
of great American values:

531
00:36:28,281 --> 00:36:31,788
Freedom, tolerance
and equality of opportunity.

532
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:34,548
Then we can claim our position

533
00:36:34,628 --> 00:36:38,628
and responsibilities
as leaders of a truly free world.

534
00:36:38,812 --> 00:36:42,588
God bless you all, and God bless
the United States of America!

535
00:36:54,988 --> 00:36:56,268
Thank you. Thank you.

536
00:37:00,308 --> 00:37:01,308
Thanks.

537
00:37:04,068 --> 00:37:06,188
- Thank you, sir.
- Fantastic.

538
00:37:06,268 --> 00:37:08,296
You've made this evening worthwhile.

539
00:37:13,668 --> 00:37:15,126
Ladies, if you'd like
to step over here.

540
00:37:15,138 --> 00:37:15,628
Sure.

541
00:37:25,068 --> 00:37:28,428
When the British royal
family visits a former colony,

542
00:37:28,508 --> 00:37:30,953
it doesn't normally make news in the US.

543
00:37:31,348 --> 00:37:34,428
But when Queen Elizabeth
dances with a former subject...

544
00:37:34,453 --> 00:37:35,453
What's up, honey?

545
00:37:35,478 --> 00:37:39,438
...a white monarch with an African
leader, the world pays attention.

546
00:37:39,682 --> 00:37:43,593
And so too did Ghanaian leader
President Nkrumah himself.

547
00:37:44,039 --> 00:37:45,919
Awed by the gesture, Nkrumah...

548
00:37:45,944 --> 00:37:48,757
I'm going to Glen Ora
with the kids in the morning.

549
00:37:49,648 --> 00:37:52,668
- It's not the weekend yet.
- ...that he was fast becoming allies...

550
00:37:52,748 --> 00:37:55,708
It's Wednesday.
It's weekend enough for me.

551
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:57,992
Don't be like that.

552
00:37:59,367 --> 00:38:02,429
Don't you take away my dignity
and then tell me how to be.

553
00:38:02,454 --> 00:38:04,534
I just wanted to thank you, that's all.

554
00:38:06,028 --> 00:38:09,108
For the second time in recent weeks,
you've been instrumental

555
00:38:09,188 --> 00:38:11,988
in changing a significant matter
of foreign policy.

556
00:38:14,382 --> 00:38:16,222
And an African state that was fast

557
00:38:16,234 --> 00:38:18,468
running into the arms of the Communists

558
00:38:18,828 --> 00:38:20,988
has been turned around
and kept in the West.

559
00:38:23,063 --> 00:38:25,156
Oh. What does that have to do with me?

560
00:38:26,146 --> 00:38:28,266
Dreary Queen Thick-Ankles?

561
00:38:30,061 --> 00:38:32,141
- What?
- Her Majestic Dullness?

562
00:38:32,998 --> 00:38:34,773
The Incurious Crown?

563
00:38:35,388 --> 00:38:37,436
Apparently, just some of the things you

564
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:39,508
said about her at a dinner in London,

565
00:38:39,588 --> 00:38:43,304
which then got back to Queen Elizabeth
and, it seems, spurred her on.

566
00:38:44,748 --> 00:38:46,810
Without those insults, she wouldn't have

567
00:38:46,822 --> 00:38:48,948
defied a Cabinet, risked her reputation

568
00:38:49,028 --> 00:38:50,828
and gone to Ghana, against all advice,

569
00:38:50,908 --> 00:38:54,007
to bring President Nkrumah
back on side, but she did.

570
00:38:55,992 --> 00:38:58,578
Pulled off some incredible
stunt with a dance.

571
00:38:58,603 --> 00:39:01,883
- And it's all thanks to you.
- They're ready for you.

572
00:39:02,797 --> 00:39:06,477
Relax. It's not like
you'll run into her in Glen Ora.

573
00:39:07,388 --> 00:39:08,781
Not Glen Ora, no.

574
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:13,375
But I am due back in London on my way
back from India and Pakistan.

575
00:39:13,668 --> 00:39:17,226
Then my advice would be
don't go to Buckingham Palace.

576
00:39:18,835 --> 00:39:22,390
- Sorry. "The provincial hotel."
- It's not so easy.

577
00:39:22,543 --> 00:39:25,406
Her sister set up a lunch
last time we were in town.

578
00:39:25,586 --> 00:39:26,786
Oh?

579
00:39:26,968 --> 00:39:28,208
Oh, that should be fun.

580
00:39:28,995 --> 00:39:32,715
Catfight!
I'll look forward to a full report.

581
00:39:33,988 --> 00:39:35,242
Come on, Bobby.

582
00:39:46,948 --> 00:39:50,868
We will shortly be reaching
a cruising altitude of 25,000 feet

583
00:39:50,948 --> 00:39:54,548
and I'm pleased to say that we
anticipate clear and calm conditions

584
00:39:54,628 --> 00:39:56,988
for the rest of our flight to London.

585
00:39:57,948 --> 00:40:01,710
Your Majesty, some more international
reactions to the Ghana trip.

586
00:40:03,181 --> 00:40:06,335
- Positive or negative?
- Overwhelmingly positive, ma'am.

587
00:40:10,081 --> 00:40:11,681
Well, just a quick look, then.

588
00:40:16,828 --> 00:40:18,132
So...

589
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:21,471
The New York Times calls it

590
00:40:21,496 --> 00:40:23,576
"shrewd strategic maneuvering,

591
00:40:23,908 --> 00:40:26,835
an example of impeccable
political brinkmanship."

592
00:40:27,375 --> 00:40:28,964
The Australian papers are very impressed

593
00:40:28,988 --> 00:40:30,708
with your commitment to the Commonwealth

594
00:40:30,788 --> 00:40:33,118
and The Illustrated London News call

595
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:35,668
it "an outstanding personal success."

596
00:40:35,748 --> 00:40:37,108
Hmm.

597
00:40:37,188 --> 00:40:38,708
Gloating doesn't suit you.

598
00:40:40,554 --> 00:40:44,148
The Ghanaian press
are calling you a socialist.

599
00:40:44,371 --> 00:40:45,411
Hmm!

600
00:40:45,828 --> 00:40:47,708
Goodness!

601
00:40:47,788 --> 00:40:49,351
One more thing.

602
00:40:49,511 --> 00:40:51,812
First Lady... Mrs. Kennedy.

603
00:40:55,104 --> 00:40:56,104
What about her?

604
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,548
Um...

605
00:40:57,628 --> 00:40:58,985
Her office has written requesting a

606
00:40:58,997 --> 00:41:00,406
private audience with Your Majesty

607
00:41:00,431 --> 00:41:02,367
prior to lunch on the 28th of March.

608
00:41:03,274 --> 00:41:04,394
Whatever for?

609
00:41:04,872 --> 00:41:06,265
Um, they didn't say.

610
00:41:07,432 --> 00:41:09,552
- Where's the lunch?
- Buckingham Palace, ma'am.

611
00:41:13,777 --> 00:41:17,092
Well, let's make the
audience Windsor Castle.

612
00:41:19,508 --> 00:41:21,748
Sometimes only a fortress will do.

613
00:41:23,588 --> 00:41:24,945
Windsor Castle.

614
00:41:42,788 --> 00:41:45,188
Eyes front!

615
00:41:45,268 --> 00:41:47,108
Hold your line!

616
00:41:51,948 --> 00:41:53,348
On the right, march!

617
00:41:59,847 --> 00:42:02,247
Make way for the Queen's Guard!

618
00:42:14,548 --> 00:42:15,988
Left, right, left...

619
00:42:16,068 --> 00:42:17,588
Good afternoon, Mrs. Kennedy.

620
00:42:18,948 --> 00:42:20,428
This way, please.

621
00:42:25,908 --> 00:42:28,228
Left, right, left, right...

622
00:42:28,308 --> 00:42:29,868
This way, Mrs. Kennedy.

623
00:42:41,828 --> 00:42:43,640
Mrs. Kennedy. This way, please.

624
00:42:59,286 --> 00:43:00,953
Mrs. Kennedy, Your Majesty.

625
00:43:02,668 --> 00:43:06,492
Your Majesty. Thank you for seeing me.

626
00:43:08,791 --> 00:43:09,831
Mrs. Kennedy.

627
00:43:11,903 --> 00:43:13,223
Do sit down.

628
00:43:17,783 --> 00:43:19,223
Thank you.

629
00:43:24,223 --> 00:43:25,343
Shall we have tea?

630
00:43:44,137 --> 00:43:47,671
I asked to speak to you in private
ahead of our lunch on Friday

631
00:43:48,523 --> 00:43:50,250
because I owe you an apology.

632
00:43:50,624 --> 00:43:51,704
Whatever for?

633
00:43:52,362 --> 00:43:54,842
I think we both know
the answer to that question.

634
00:43:59,908 --> 00:44:00,929
Thank you.

635
00:44:08,628 --> 00:44:12,348
At a social occasion,
shortly after our last visit,

636
00:44:12,428 --> 00:44:15,054
I... I made some comments,

637
00:44:15,539 --> 00:44:17,868
some foolish comments

638
00:44:17,948 --> 00:44:19,664
which I believe got back to you.

639
00:44:19,785 --> 00:44:21,505
There really is no need for this.

640
00:44:23,168 --> 00:44:24,640
Reports that you'd said...

641
00:44:25,906 --> 00:44:28,742
certain things did get back to me.

642
00:44:29,628 --> 00:44:32,710
And I'll confess
to being momentarily surprised,

643
00:44:32,976 --> 00:44:35,988
since they in no way reflected
what I understood to be the spirit

644
00:44:36,068 --> 00:44:37,515
of our meeting.

645
00:44:37,579 --> 00:44:40,437
But in this job, I've learned,
as I'm sure you have too,

646
00:44:41,094 --> 00:44:42,898
not to take things too seriously.

647
00:44:43,063 --> 00:44:45,898
People say things
for all sorts of reasons,

648
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:48,908
which get misquoted or misunderstood
and, before you know it,

649
00:44:48,988 --> 00:44:51,308
those words have turned
into something quite different

650
00:44:51,481 --> 00:44:54,226
and everyone's upset or up in arms.

651
00:44:55,429 --> 00:44:58,068
I'm quite sure that you meant
no harm, nor disrespect.

652
00:44:58,273 --> 00:45:02,132
After all, why would you?
We barely know one another.

653
00:45:02,726 --> 00:45:05,456
Still, it was inexcusable so I can't

654
00:45:05,468 --> 00:45:08,668
offer an excuse but, if you'll allow me,

655
00:45:08,748 --> 00:45:10,765
I'd like to offer an explanation.

656
00:45:13,167 --> 00:45:14,727
Yes, of course.

657
00:45:15,306 --> 00:45:18,976
Last time we were in London,
Jack and I probably seemed,

658
00:45:19,312 --> 00:45:21,668
at least from the outside,
to be riding on a high.

659
00:45:21,748 --> 00:45:23,428
Yes, I should say so.

660
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:26,735
The most celebrated
and most famous couple in the world.

661
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:32,080
The truth is that I was still suffering
from post-natal problems

662
00:45:32,246 --> 00:45:35,687
after the birth of our son,
and Jack had his own health issues.

663
00:45:36,261 --> 00:45:39,835
To say we were strained
would be an understatement.

664
00:45:41,053 --> 00:45:42,710
So, when we got to Paris...

665
00:45:44,108 --> 00:45:45,468
...I don't mind telling you,

666
00:45:45,493 --> 00:45:47,693
I took some pleasure in shining there.

667
00:45:48,348 --> 00:45:51,148
Then, at the Élysée Palace...

668
00:45:51,228 --> 00:45:54,508
I am the man who accompanied
Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris...

669
00:45:58,068 --> 00:45:59,348
I enjoyed it.

670
00:45:59,428 --> 00:46:02,588
Jack didn't appreciate being upstaged.

671
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:06,367
- Behind closed doors...
- I can imagine.

672
00:46:10,039 --> 00:46:12,039
There were other factors, too.

673
00:46:13,285 --> 00:46:14,565
Our doctor.

674
00:46:15,663 --> 00:46:18,235
Dr Jacobson routinely administers us

675
00:46:18,247 --> 00:46:20,903
his "cocktails" before major trips.

676
00:46:22,748 --> 00:46:24,028
Vitamins.

677
00:46:26,889 --> 00:46:28,593
But other substances too.

678
00:46:31,508 --> 00:46:34,628
To help pep us up or...

679
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,040
calm us down.

680
00:46:40,573 --> 00:46:43,527
On the occasion of that dinner,
he had given me something.

681
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:46,613
A little... booster.

682
00:46:47,621 --> 00:46:49,128
There were these beautiful paintings.

683
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:50,542
I told him I needed cheering up.

684
00:46:51,804 --> 00:46:53,684
But I guess it loosened my tongue.

685
00:46:55,633 --> 00:46:59,635
And then I heard some of these
terrible things got back to you and...

686
00:47:02,207 --> 00:47:04,967
I can't tell you how much distress
it's caused me.

687
00:47:06,424 --> 00:47:10,426
The idea that I might've
upset someone I admire so much.

688
00:47:11,606 --> 00:47:13,168
That's very kind of you to say.

689
00:47:13,889 --> 00:47:15,098
It's true.

690
00:47:15,936 --> 00:47:20,270
The way you do your job,
the way you cope with the pressure,

691
00:47:20,762 --> 00:47:24,068
the personal sacrifices you've made,

692
00:47:24,093 --> 00:47:27,816
not to mention
your composure and dignity.

693
00:47:30,306 --> 00:47:32,666
As a woman, it's so inspiring.

694
00:47:33,628 --> 00:47:35,316
And what you just did in Ghana.

695
00:47:36,548 --> 00:47:38,184
It was just extraordinary.

696
00:47:42,913 --> 00:47:47,340
What I should've said
was that I didn't do very much in Ghana.

697
00:47:48,268 --> 00:47:50,816
I got on a plane and I went.

698
00:47:51,708 --> 00:47:52,908
And the only reason I went

699
00:47:52,988 --> 00:47:56,668
was because I felt utterly useless
in comparison to you.

700
00:47:57,703 --> 00:47:59,223
And I was trying to compete.

701
00:48:00,338 --> 00:48:05,027
And if anything, I owe you
a huge debt of gratitude.

702
00:48:07,438 --> 00:48:08,878
But I didn't.

703
00:48:10,309 --> 00:48:11,762
I just sat there.

704
00:48:13,025 --> 00:48:14,745
And I let her say her piece.

705
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,809
- And savored your victory.
- Yes.

706
00:48:18,887 --> 00:48:22,308
And what do you want from me
now? A ticking-off?

707
00:48:22,388 --> 00:48:24,419
Well, don't you think
I'm deserving of one?

708
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:27,683
- No.
- But she was so broken.

709
00:48:28,708 --> 00:48:31,113
And fragile and lost.

710
00:48:33,009 --> 00:48:35,168
You did exactly the right thing.

711
00:48:37,304 --> 00:48:40,544
She insulted you, all of us,
and you're not a saint.

712
00:48:40,828 --> 00:48:42,788
- No.
- We know that already.

713
00:48:45,863 --> 00:48:48,623
There's ice in those veins
when there needs to be.

714
00:48:48,648 --> 00:48:49,648
Yes.

715
00:48:51,565 --> 00:48:53,125
Well, three cheers to that.

716
00:49:04,828 --> 00:49:06,828
Last one, ma'am,
but she's a big heavy one.

717
00:49:06,908 --> 00:49:09,508
Right, pick up the slack.

718
00:49:09,588 --> 00:49:10,828
Yes.

719
00:49:11,868 --> 00:49:13,828
That's it, you got it. Daniel!

720
00:49:13,908 --> 00:49:16,588
- No, it's caught.
- Keep going up the hill.

721
00:49:28,942 --> 00:49:30,504
- Ma'am.
- What is it?

722
00:49:30,529 --> 00:49:31,934
You're needed back at the house.

723
00:49:32,673 --> 00:49:33,673
Right.

724
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:41,119
- What's going on?
- I dunno, lad.

725
00:49:42,064 --> 00:49:43,395
Something's happened.

726
00:49:51,649 --> 00:49:52,649
Ma'am.

727
00:49:55,028 --> 00:49:58,108
There was absolute
pandemonium around the scene.

728
00:49:58,188 --> 00:50:01,188
People screamed and lay down
on the ground as shots were heard.

729
00:50:01,268 --> 00:50:03,321
Reporters saw President Kennedy lying

730
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:05,676
flat on his face on the seat of his car.

731
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:07,748
Men and women were screaming.

732
00:50:08,027 --> 00:50:10,520
He saw blood on the President's head.

733
00:50:10,788 --> 00:50:13,588
This is all we have
here in Washington at this moment.

734
00:50:13,668 --> 00:50:16,908
And for the moment, I return you
to Radio Newsreel in London.

735
00:50:16,988 --> 00:50:19,418
Hello, London.
I've just heard from Dallas

736
00:50:19,443 --> 00:50:21,412
that the President is still alive

737
00:50:21,468 --> 00:50:23,316
but in critical condition.

738
00:50:23,777 --> 00:50:26,068
He was apparently shot in the head

739
00:50:26,203 --> 00:50:30,184
and the Governor of Texas, Governor
Connally, was shot in the chest.

740
00:50:30,379 --> 00:50:34,028
Mrs. Kennedy was weeping,
trying to hold up her husband's head,

741
00:50:34,053 --> 00:50:38,253
when the reporters reached the car
as it dashed toward the hospital.

742
00:50:38,278 --> 00:50:41,785
Vice President Lyndon Johnson
was in the car behind the President.

743
00:50:42,108 --> 00:50:45,496
Blood transfusions are
being given to President Kennedy.

744
00:50:45,706 --> 00:50:49,168
However, one of the two priests
called into the room

745
00:50:49,193 --> 00:50:52,403
has administered
the Last Sacrament of the Church

746
00:50:52,428 --> 00:50:54,228
to President Kennedy.

747
00:50:55,007 --> 00:50:58,087
Mrs. Kennedy
and Mrs. Connally are stunned,

748
00:50:58,112 --> 00:51:01,192
but they are at the bedsides
of their husbands.

749
00:51:10,083 --> 00:51:11,203
He's dead.

750
00:51:50,668 --> 00:51:52,293
Late yesterday afternoon...

751
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:54,357
Didn't you say how unhappy she was?

752
00:51:55,176 --> 00:51:56,456
In the marriage?

753
00:51:58,822 --> 00:52:01,222
- Yes.
- ...accompanied the fallen President,

754
00:52:01,428 --> 00:52:04,228
- her clothes still...
- That's the thing about unhappiness.

755
00:52:04,308 --> 00:52:06,428
...of this most unthinkable
and senseless crime...

756
00:52:06,453 --> 00:52:09,013
All it takes is for something worse
to come along...

757
00:52:09,148 --> 00:52:10,543
...taken in a gray naval ambulance...

758
00:52:10,567 --> 00:52:13,456
...and you realize it was
actually happiness after all.

759
00:52:13,924 --> 00:52:16,120
...conveyed into the hospital in plain

760
00:52:16,132 --> 00:52:18,456
sight of thousands of waiting mourners

761
00:52:19,223 --> 00:52:22,183
as disbelieving and shaken,
tonight, as our entire nation.

762
00:52:22,208 --> 00:52:23,988
She's still wearing the same clothes!

763
00:52:25,948 --> 00:52:28,003
Couldn't they have found her
something else?

764
00:52:28,533 --> 00:52:30,293
The President's casket
was transferred...

765
00:52:30,318 --> 00:52:32,518
She's covered in her husband's blood.

766
00:52:32,543 --> 00:52:35,623
Relatives and loved ones
joined the grieving Mrs. Kennedy

767
00:52:35,648 --> 00:52:37,222
for a private mass in the East Room...

768
00:52:37,234 --> 00:52:38,503
No, I think it's deliberate.

769
00:52:38,528 --> 00:52:41,208
...before the body is moved
to the Rotunda of the Capitol.

770
00:52:41,456 --> 00:52:43,430
The last day in the life of the first

771
00:52:43,442 --> 00:52:45,696
Catholic President of the United States.

772
00:52:45,988 --> 00:52:47,748
Where are you going?

773
00:52:48,233 --> 00:52:51,553
Lyndon Johnson,
sworn in on Air Force One,

774
00:52:51,578 --> 00:52:52,858
less than 100 minutes

775
00:52:52,883 --> 00:52:55,120
after the official death
of President Kennedy...

776
00:53:04,519 --> 00:53:07,279
He begins his work
as the 36th President...

777
00:53:07,304 --> 00:53:09,815
- Your Majesty.
- Michael.

778
00:53:10,815 --> 00:53:13,051
I'd like everyone in the royal household

779
00:53:13,506 --> 00:53:15,456
to observe a full week
of court mourning.

780
00:53:17,468 --> 00:53:21,148
And I would like the bell rung
at Westminster Abbey.

781
00:53:23,313 --> 00:53:26,846
Ma'am, custom dictates

782
00:53:26,871 --> 00:53:28,428
that the bell only be rung...

783
00:53:28,508 --> 00:53:31,076
When a member of the
royal family dies.

784
00:53:31,088 --> 00:53:31,948
I know.

785
00:53:33,421 --> 00:53:39,143
But I would like it to be rung
every minute, for an hour,

786
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,510
from eleven o'clock until midday.

787
00:53:47,087 --> 00:53:48,207
Yes, ma'am.

788
00:53:48,239 --> 00:53:50,679
...join President Johnson

789
00:53:50,704 --> 00:53:52,862
in his prayer for God's help.

790
00:53:53,368 --> 00:53:56,128
May we all find some light and hope

791
00:53:56,529 --> 00:53:59,529
in the darkness of the days
that lie ahead.
