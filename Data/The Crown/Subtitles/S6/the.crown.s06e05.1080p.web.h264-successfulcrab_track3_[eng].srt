Would you like some of this muesli?

13
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,680

Are you sure
you're ready for this?

28
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,640
I spoke to your housemaster yesterday

29
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,040
and suggested you might attend
as a day pupil for a little while.

30
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,000
Why?

31
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,880
Well, just until
things get a little easier.

32
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,080
You could stay with me at Highgrove.

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,920
I'm fine.

34
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,400
Or with Granny at Windsor.

35
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,160
Well, obviously, it's your choice. I just...
I just want you to move at your own speed.

36
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,240
This is my speed.

37
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,760
I want things to go back to normal
as quickly as possible.

38
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,480
Sir.

39
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,360
How are you, William?

40
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,880
- Good to see you.
- Thank you.

41
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,360
- We're glad to have you back with us.
- Thank you, sir.

42
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,000
Hello?

43
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,600
<i>How did it go?</i>

44
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,600
You are kind.

45
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,040
It was all a little uncomfortable,
if I'm honest.

46
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,920
As if he's cross with me in some way.

47
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,720
Well...

48
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,440
- Give it time.
- <i>That's what I said, give it time.</i>

49
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,360
Everyone would understand, but...

50
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,520
he couldn't get back to school
and away from me quickly enough.

51
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,560
<i>You said he likes his housemaster.</i>

52
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,200
<i>Yes, Dr. Gailey.</i>

53
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,680
<i>That's encouraging.</i>

54
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,120
<i>I'm sure these days they've got better
at handling a situation like this.</i>

55
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,160
<i>Oh, let's hope so. I'd hate it
for him to be at Gordonstoun in my day.</i>

56
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,120
<i>Their idea of grief counseling</i>

57
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,200
<i>would've been a cold shower
and a long march, cross-country.</i>

58
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,400
What's wrong with that?

59
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,720
Better than having some awful fuss made
and being mollycoddled.

60
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,360
Yes. Well, we're different in that way.

61
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,400
<i>Mmm.</i>

62
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,160
<i>Does he have friends at school?</i>

63
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,040
Of course. What a question.

64
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,440
Why? You didn't.

65
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,160
<i>True.</i>

66
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,240
Well, it's better he's with his gang.

67
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,760
They'll look after him.

68
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,240
<i>Hmm.</i>

69
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,720
Sometimes, as parents,

70
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,920
we have to admit defeat.

71
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,760
Mmm.

72
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,720
<i>- All right. I'll talk to you soon.
- </i>  Right.

73
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,000
There are two deliveries.
This one's from the school.

74
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,360
More than 600 boys
felt moved to offer their condolences.

75
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,480
That's so kind.

76
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,720
And this one contains letters
from all around the world.

77
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,320
Mostly, I think, from young ladies.

78
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,240
If there's anything you need,
you know where I am.

79
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,480
<i>Dear William,
we don't know one another.</i>

80
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,440
<i>I'm two years above you
and in a different house,</i>

81
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,120
{\an8}<i>but I wanted to write
to offer my condolences.</i>

82
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,320
{\an8}<i>I can only imagine
what you must be going through.</i>

83
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,040
{\an8}<i>Please rest assured,
all of us in B block have your back.</i>

84
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,560
<i>Andrew Hartley Potts.</i>

85
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,400
<i>Dear Wills,</i>

86
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,520
<i>we're all so sorry for your loss.</i>

87
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,840
<i>Just know that all the boys in ALHG
are here for you</i>

88
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,680
<i>if you ever need anything,</i>

89
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:31,040
<i>including first dibs on the PlayStation
and unlimited cups of tea.</i>

90
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,000
<i>Dear William, all of us
on the water polo team are thinking of you</i>

91
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
<i>and are looking forward to having you back
when you feel ready.</i>

92
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,960
<i>Preferably sooner rather than later,</i>

93
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,000
<i>as Kindersley is
not a patch on you as keeper.</i>

94
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:53,320
<i>Dear William,
I feel so sad for your loss.</i>

95
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,480
<i>My mother has always loved
the royal family,</i>

96
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,520
<i>especially Princess Diana.</i>

97
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,520
<i>She said she was an angel,
and I know you're an angel too.</i>

98
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,760
<i>I have enclosed my picture.
My friends tell me I am very pretty...</i>

99
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,600
<i>Dear William,
you look so cute in a suit and tie.</i>

100
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,240
<i>I am sure you will look really sexy
when you have a crown on your head.</i>

101
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,680
<i>I bet you have a great body
as you play so many sports.</i>

102
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,360
<i>I've sent you my favorite teddy.</i>

103
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,040
<i>Like me, she's soft and cuddly.</i>

104
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,640
<i>Please hold her tight
when you lie in bed each night</i>

105
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,840
<i>and think of me.
I hope she will comfort you in your grief...</i>

106
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,080
<i>Dear William, you are so brave
for walking behind your mother's coffin.</i>

107
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,720
<i>I can't stop thinking about it.</i>

108
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,280
<i>I lost my mom last year to cancer,</i>

109
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,080
<i>and I think about her
every minute of the day.</i>

110
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,360
<i>I know how you feel inside.</i>

111
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,680
<i>You are not alone.</i>

112
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,880
<i>These people are waiting to see</i>

113
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,720
<i>the people's princess pass by
on her last journey.</i>

114
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,280
<i>And the royal family are
at the gates of Buckingham Palace,</i>

115
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,560
<i>waiting to do exactly the same thing.</i>

116
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,280
- Good shot, mate.
- Good shot.

117
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,640
- Great shot.
- Go on, mate!

118
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,280
Wales... Dr. Gailey
wants to see you in his study.

119
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,240
Okay. Take that.

120
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,520
<i>For a while,
I suspect it's going to feel</i>

121
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,560
<i>as though the only question
anyone asks is how you're feeling.</i>

122
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,320
But, as your housemaster, it, uh...

123
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,800
it is actually my job.

124
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,760
I'm fine.

125
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,520
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

126
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,760
I only ask
because the school has received a request

127
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,400
for your attendance at an official event.

128
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,320
As you know,
the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh

129
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,680
are celebrating their
golden wedding anniversary this year.

130
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,080
As you can imagine, there are
any number of commemorative events.

131
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,960
I insisted you be given
the right to refuse.

132
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,600
And I was reassured

133
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,000
everyone would understand perfectly
if you did.

134
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,960
No, it's fine. I'll do it.

135
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,080
Really?

136
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,600
Well, the good news is...
you'll only be required for half a day,

137
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,240
starting with

138
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,080
an official photograph
at Buckingham Palace,

139
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,920
followed by a thanksgiving service
at Westminster Abbey,

140
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,320
and then a lunch
at the Royal Naval College in Greenwich.

141
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,720
Listen, I've been speaking
with your tutor.

142
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,680
He tells me
you've been pushing yourself hard.

143
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,800
Long hours in the library.

144
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,480
Extra society meetings.

145
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,160
I know distraction helps.

146
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,160
A few years ago,
my wife received some bad news.

147
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,160
A, um...

148
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,960
a diagnosis of leukemia.

149
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,560
Mrs. Gailey is better now.

150
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,440
But at the time,

151
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,440
neither of us really allowed ourselves
to take a step back,

152
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,080
to take a moment to...

153
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,680
to slow down...

154
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,600
and process what was really going on.

155
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,200
Was there anything else
you wanted to see me about, sir?

156
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,920
No.

157
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,320
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

158
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,960
Thank you.

159
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,240
Three, two, one.

160
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,160
Sir, thank you. Three, two, one.

161
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,640
William, keep smiling, darling.

162
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,920
Three, two, one.

163
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,600
- Well, this is a riot.
<i>- </i>  Yeah.

164
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,800
Here.

165
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,080
- No, thanks.
- I filled it with champagne.

166
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,520
Come on, you know you want to.

167
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:38,040
I haven’t gotten through the day
without a mint since 1978. Imagine!

168
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,120
Ah...

169
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,320
There is nothing
that a peppermint fondant cream...

170
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,800
How's school?

171
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,760
Shit.

172
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,360
Same.

173
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,840
- Everyone's being so...
- Weird.

174
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,520
Actually, I was gonna say "kind."

175
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,800
That's what's weird.

176
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,080
How kind everyone's being.

177
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,640
I can't wait for everyone
to just go back to being normal.

178
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,760
Uh-oh. Pa alert. Two o'clock.

179
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,520
Right. Shall we?

180
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,240
<i>There's a couple
of names and faces</i>

181
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,040
you need to pretend to remember
when they come over to you.

182
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,200
Jean, Grand Duke of Luxembourg,

183
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,200
late seventies, white mustache.

184
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,600
Albert II, King of the Belgians,

185
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,320
large glasses, looks like a bank manager.

186
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,400
His wife, Queen Paola,
she's blond, Italian,

187
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,680
and, I'm willing to bet, comes
wearing an enormous, overly colorful hat.

188
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,200
And King Harald of, uh, Norway.

189
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,520
He's, uh, bald, and his head
is shaped like an egg.

190
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,960
Royal Troop!

191
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,120
Present arms!

192
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,080
Sir.

193
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:01,240
<i>It was madness.
Like the arrival of some pop star.</i>

194
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,760
I'm not surprised.

195
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,280
He's such a handsome boy.

196
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,680
<i>I don't think my family knew
quite what to make of it all.</i>

197
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,520
The whole thing has
a distinct feeling of déjà vu.

198
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,240
<i>You mean Diana?</i>

199
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,040
He does look remarkably like his mother.

200
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,160
<i>Yes.</i>

201
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,720
And it's painful to watch

202
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,760
because, unlike Diana,
Will is a shy old thing,

203
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,760
not comfortable
with that kind of attention.

204
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,080
<i>Well, who would be?</i>

205
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,880
So he needs your support.

206
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,360
<i>I'm trying, but... he doesn't make it easy.</i>

207
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,360
<i>He's so monosyllabic these days,
he's almost hostile.</i>

208
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,480
This isn't about
what you're getting from him.

209
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,440
<i>And it's not as if I was given
the best example to follow.</i>

210
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,480
<i>The Duke of Edinburgh was hardly
the most communicative or...</i>

211
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,880
<i>affectionate father to me.</i>

212
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,400
<i>Hardly surprising given the delinquency
of his own father's parenting.</i>

213
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,360
I'm afraid we don't do fathers and sons
very well in this family.

214
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,400
<i>And you know my attitude to that.</i>

215
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,880
It's no excuse.

216
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,160
<i>It really isn't.</i>

217
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,000
The boys need you now more than ever.

218
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,440
And if I may...

219
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,640
<i>Go on.</i>

220
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,240
You need them too.

221
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,320
<i>What kind of man
can look himself in the eye</i>

222
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,960
<i>if he is a father
and know that he's failed at that?</i>

223
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,040
A quick word?

224
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,560
Someone from
the Prince of Wales's office called

225
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,640
asking if your father
might come and see you.

226
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,240
Here?

227
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,680
I said you could use my office.

228
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,080
Valentine's Day.

229
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,840
Yeah.

230
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,920
Would you, um...

231
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,440
would you like me to dispose of them?

232
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,240
Thank you.

233
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,880
There's always next year.

234
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,080
Sir.

235
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,840
<i>I hope I'm not
dragging you away from anything.</i>

236
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,600
Just wanted to see

237
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,600
how you were.

238
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,280
Fine.

239
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,880
And school?

240
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,760
Fine.

241
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,120
Friends?

242
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,680
Fine.

243
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,600
Oh, I heard you, um, broke
you the school record

244
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,040
in, um, swimming the... 50 meters.

245
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,360
The junior record.

246
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,440
Well done.

247
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,640
Oh, I spoke with Harry yesterday, and, um...

248
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,960
I suggested to him
that it might be nice for us all to

249
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,080
visit Mummy's grave.

250
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,840
Place some flowers.

251
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,800
Maybe it's... maybe it's too soon.

252
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,880
Oh, there was something else.

253
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:26,120
I'd like both of you to join me
in a visit to Canada over Easter.

254
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,640
The idea is to combine
a few official engagements

255
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,920
with a four-day skiing holiday
in Whistler.

256
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:39,000
- Just the three of us.
- I had plans to see friends.

257
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,720
I think it'll be... it'll be good for us.

258
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,880
As a family.

259
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,400
And for you.

260
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,520
And... and Harry.

261
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,800
It was agony.

262
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:00,360
- <i>At least you made the effort.</i>
- Yes, and he pushed it back in my face.

263
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,960
<i>Well, that is his right.</i>

264
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,160
Imagine if I'd ever
spoken to my father like that.

265
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,840
<i>Different generation.</i>

266
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,680
Honestly, I'm black and blue.

267
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,760
<i>Well, it's all part of the job
of being a father,</i>

268
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,640
which, I believe, is probably
the most important job you'll ever have.

269
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,600
I know.

270
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,000
No, you don't know.

271
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,280
You think you know.
But it's obvious you really don't know.

272
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,000
I'll know when you know, and let you know.

273
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,520
Right!

274
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,920
Oh God, I miss you.

275
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,960
When can I see you?

276
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,760
<i>Not yet.</i>

277
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,720
- Yeah.
<i>- Too soon.</i>

278
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,800
Yes.

279
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,520
The prison of public opinion.

280
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,840
How are you in all this? You all right?

281
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,040
<i>I'm the last person
you should worry about.</i>

282
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,280
You've been so patient.

283
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,960
So gallant.

284
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,240
How you've suffered
throughout all this, my poor darling.

285
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,680
Boohoo, poor me.

286
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,280
These are exceptional circumstances.

287
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,360
<i>Mmm.</i>

288
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,080
I'm fine.

289
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,840
<i>Speak tomorrow.</i>

290
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,920
So, okay, well, that looks good.

291
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,680
Yeah, you can see
in the documents, the itineraries

292
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:34,000
that there's a... there's a few
moments of, uh... of rest for you.

293
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,440
Who's the Italian man?

294
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,160
- Massimo Bueno.
- Open wide.

295
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,240
We met him
at Highgrove that time...

296
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,160
Go on.

297
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,400
- Oh!
- He's rather good, isn't he?

298
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,240
I think he's very switched-on,
and apparently, they're planning...

299
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,280
a scheme to... to, uh, give placement...

300
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,200
...abroad...

301
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,760
to, um, disadvantaged young people.

302
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,240
They want the Prince's Trust
to be the lead partner.

303
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,120
- Well, that's encouraging.
- Yeah.

304
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,200
Which, um...

305
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,160
which, um...
countries were they thinking of?

306
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,320
It's a joint initiative
with Italy and Sweden, so I presume now...

307
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,320
Oh!

308
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,320
- Nice to see you, Your Royal Highness.
- Thank you very much.

309
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,880
- Thank you, Your Highness.
- Thank you so much.

310
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,320
- Welcome.
- Thank you very much.

311
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,520
- What's all this?
- Sorry, I had no idea.

312
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,320
- Did you know about this?
- No, sir.

313
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,600
<i>Charles, Prince of Wales,
and his sons, Princes William and Harry,</i>

314
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,360
<i>arrived in Vancouver tonight
for a six-day visit to British Columbia.</i>

315
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,560
<i>The three princes
will make public appearances</i>

316
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,000
<i>during the next two days</i>

317
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,080
<i>before retreating to Whistler
for a ski holiday.</i>

318
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,160
<i>CTV's Colin Gray reports.</i>

319
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,840
G and T or whiskey?

320
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,800
Beer's fine.

321
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,840
<i>Help me welcome our players today...</i>

322
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,200
<i>- How you doing?</i>
<i>- Hello.</i>

323
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,840
- <i>Nice to see you.</i>
<i>- Hello.</i>

324
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,840
<i>Wendy Goodson, born in, uh, Peru.</i>

325
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,400
<i>And part of the air force for five years.
In what capacity?</i>

326
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,880
- <i>Air force. Shipping cargo.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

327
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,600
<i>And you served Desert Storm
as part of that.</i>

328
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:44,920
<i>Welcome to the show. Playing with you here
is Matt Sutherland, just got married...</i>

329
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,040
To Mummy.

330
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,920
To Mummy.

331
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,760
You know he's lined up
some official visits for us tomorrow?

332
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,440
- Who?
- Pa.

333
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,400
Oh yeah, I heard.
A school for the deaf in the morning.

334
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:14,160
And a tour of some...
space center in the afternoon.

335
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,520
He assured me
they'd be shutting the place down.

336
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,360
To keep the girls out.

337
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,960
"Marry me, William! I love you!"

338
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,760
Fuck off.

339
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,640
I'm just jealous.

340
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,760
In the history of humankind, no one has
ever screamed for someone with red hair.

341
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,400
<i>There's a new teenage heartthrob in town.</i>

342
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,000
<i>Tall, blond, and blessed
with his mother's good looks,</i>

343
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,760
<i>Prince William is officially a sensation.</i>

344
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,040
<i>The world is gripped by Willsmania.</i>

345
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,200
<i>With his blushes and demure smile,</i>

346
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,800
<i>the young prince sometimes
seemed embarrassed by the limelight.</i>

347
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,800
<i>But for the many girls
who mobbed him and chanted his name,</i>

348
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,120
<i>this only added to his appeal.</i>

349
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,000
- He's the one and only Prince Charming!
- I love him.

350
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,280
And he said hi, and then he shook my hand.

351
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,480
I shook his hand!

352
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:17,200
The moon itself
is kept in orbit by forces of gravity,

353
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,520
which means it is
inextricably connected to the earth.

354
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,040
But... one mustn't
take this relationship for granted

355
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,840
because the moon does, in fact,

356
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,160
seem to have
a slow-burning will of its own...

357
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,840
I thought we'd start on
a gentle run called Mathew's Traverse,

358
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,960
and then either we come down the Saddle
here, which is a little trickier,

359
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:41,280
or, if we really fancy our chances,
there's the Couloir Extreme,

360
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:46,840
billed as "two and a half thousand feet
of thigh-burning hell."

361
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,960
Yes!

362
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,480
Couloir it is.

363
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,280
Now, I've told everyone
that for the next few days,

364
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,480
no more interruptions.

365
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,120
It's to be the three of us
on our own, family holiday.

366
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,680
Um...

367
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,640
There's just one... brief thing

368
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,320
that we... need to get out of the way first.

369
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,400
A photo-call
with a small group of invited journalists.

370
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,320
No.

371
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,680
And then we can head out.

372
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,920
Willy, that's the way it works.

373
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,600
We give them something,
and they leave us alone.

374
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,000
- You know I hate this stuff.
- It's really not much.

375
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,720
It's already been
a thousand times more than I agreed to.

376
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,520
And I've tried to protect you from it
as much as possible,

377
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,720
but I'm afraid it's just... something
we've all got to learn to live with.

378
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,800
But I hate it.

379
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,600
Hate the press. Hate the crowds.
Why tell us we're going somewhere alone,

380
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,440
then put us in front of the people
we hate most in the world?

381
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,040
I know.
It's insufferable, but... getting angry

382
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45,680
and refusing to go out there
is not the way to endear yourself.

383
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,680
I'm not the one
who needs to endear myself.

384
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,640
I'm not the one with the image problem.

385
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,400
That was pretty harsh.

386
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,120
He did always say we'd have to combine
official duties with the holiday.

387
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,640
I don't care.

388
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,800
It's true. He needs to hear it.

389
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,360
Over here, William!

390
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,720
Smile, sir!

391
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,120
- William!
- Back here, Your Royal Highness!

392
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,800
- William!
- Over here, William!

393
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,280
- Prince William!
- William!

394
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,440
<i>That's the word
he used? "Hate"?</i>

395
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,840
Again and again.

396
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,000
Hating the press is one thing.

397
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,560
After what happened to his mother,
who can blame him?

398
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,360
But having that attitude
towards the public...

399
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,040
Not ideal for a future heir to the throne.

400
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:30,400
Well, you know, we have to remember,
he is just a teenager.

401
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,720
Yes, but a teenager who went
back to school straight after the funeral

402
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:37,680
and struggles to express his feelings
about his mother's death.

403
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,800
Ah, well, that's not something
you can force.

404
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,080
It is something
you can encourage though.

405
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,120
But the danger is that he'll simply

406
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,520
shut all that away

407
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,800
with terrible consequences later in life.

408
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:57,320
Tears and self-pity aren't exactly
common currency in this family.

409
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,760
But it's not self-pity, is it?
It's grief.

410
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,880
And for his own sake,
he needs to let it all out.

411
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,800
Will you talk to him, Mummy?

412
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,080
Sometimes it's easier
when it's not the parent.

413
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,480
You know how fond he is of you.

414
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:17,640
But isn't this precisely
where a parent is most needed?

415
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,840
- Can I have one of the peppers?
- Yes.

416
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,240
There you are.

417
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,000
What would you like?

418
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,280
I had a telephone call.

419
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,240
The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh
would like to see you on Sunday for tea.

420
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,680
- Okay. Thank you, sir.
- Potato?

421
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,680
What would you like?

422
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,680
Sir.

423
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,320
Prince William, Your Royal Highness.

424
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,240
Granny and Grandpa?

425
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,520
Uh...

426
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,280
They decided to leave us to it.

427
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:09,120
Or rather they told me
that we should be left to it.

428
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,240
And I agreed that was best.

429
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,520
Why?

430
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,160
- Because you and I need to talk.
- What about?

431
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,520
You're angry with me.

432
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,960
I'm not angry with you.

433
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,360
Come on, it's obvious. I can feel it.

434
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,040
The press and all this unwanted
new attention that you've been getting,

435
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,040
they might have upset you,

436
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,760
but really all your frustrations
have been pointed at me.

437
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,120
Is it any wonder?

438
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,640
Well, to me, it is, yes.

439
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,320
Frankly, I'm at a loss.

440
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,360
Well, don't just smirk.

441
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,360
Help me to understand.

442
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,560
For a start, you...

443
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,040
you never talk about her.
<i>We</i> never talk about her.

444
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,200
I agree, and we should talk about her.
The more the better.

445
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,200
About her life, about

446
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,400
our memories of her.

447
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,960
Why do you think I wouldn't want that?

448
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:15,120
Perhaps you don't like
to be reminded how we got to this point.

449
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,320
Don't you think
there might be a connection

450
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,560
between where we all are now
and your part in it?

451
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,360
I hope you're not insinuating
what I think you are.

452
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,280
Let us be quite clear.

453
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,440
Your mother's death
was a terrible tragedy,

454
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:46,280
caused by one irresponsible man
drinking too much,

455
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,680
then getting behind the wheel of a car
and driving too fast

456
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,240
to escape from photographers.

457
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,520
Which you and I both know
she often encouraged.

458
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,160
The fact that she was in Paris?

459
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,160
- Her choice.
- With that man? Those people?

460
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,640
- Again, her choice.
- Without any royal protection!

461
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,280
That was not my doing. I always said
she needed police protection.

462
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:07,200
But she should never have
been anywhere near the Fayeds!

463
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:11,520
She should have been safe with us.
The fact that she wasn't <i>is</i> your fault.

464
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,080
No, you didn't actually drive the car,

465
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,400
but you drove her into the arms
of those that did.

466
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,880
By making her so unhappy.

467
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,800
By loving someone else.

468
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,880
Well, if you want to make that

469
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,000
connection, then...

470
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,680
that's your right, but...

471
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,560
I find it very upsetting, and

472
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,080
deeply unkind.

473
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,320
My responsibility for Mummy ended
a long time before she got to Paris.

474
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,240
That accident was not in any way my fault.

475
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,920
And to even suggest it was is...
is outrageous.

476
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,880
Is it?

477
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,240
Yes.

478
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,560
I resent the accusation.

479
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,280
With everything else
you've started to resent about me?

480
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,120
I don't know what you're talking about.
I could not be more proud of you.

481
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,960
Proud of how you've come through this,
proud of how you're growing up,

482
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,440
proud of your popularity.

483
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:32,040
Since when have you taken pleasure
in anyone else's popularity?

484
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,840
- We both know you struggle being upstaged.
- Nonsense.

485
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,840
It's true.

486
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:40,800
All those games of one-upmanship
you and Mummy used to play.

487
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,440
Stories in the press.
Stealing each other's headlines.

488
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:47,880
- Always tried to outshine one another.
- No one ever outshone your mother.

489
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,160
You think I'm just like her.
And you hate me for it.

490
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:53,920
William.

491
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,000
William, look, I admit, I...

492
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,920
It... it has been strange.

493
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:05,880
Unnerving, perhaps,
to see the... similarities.

494
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,680
The way the...

495
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,400
crowds connect with you, adore you,

496
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,520
the way you... move something in them.

497
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,640
And, yes, all right, I'm...
still getting used to it because I...

498
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,720
I do see her in you.

499
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,360
But that's not a bad thing.
In fact, it's a rather wonderful thing.

500
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,800
And it's only natural

501
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,720
between a son and his mother.

502
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,360
Look, I...

503
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,200
I know I haven't got everything right.

504
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:50,320
What parent does? I wish I had
half your mother's emotional intelligence.

505
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,320
And I'm sorry I haven't

506
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,760
risen to the occasion

507
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,000
in the way that you wanted me to, but

508
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,200
the thing that people don't understand is
that I've been grieving too.

509
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,040
Really?

510
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,920
<i>Your</i> grief.
You're talking to me about your grief?

511
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,520
Yes, of course.

512
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,720
What? You think I'm not shattered by this?

513
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,160
Your mother and I had just
patched up our differences. We'd--

514
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,840
Patched up your differences?

515
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,520
What planet are you on?

516
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,360
She still loved you,

517
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,200
and only wanted to be
in the South of France

518
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,480
so not to be there when you threw
a birthday party for the other one.

519
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,080
Oh.

520
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:53,200
I hope you don't mind.
Dr. Gailey let me in.

521
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,160
Sorry.

522
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,960
Oh, nothing to be ashamed of.

523
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,160
Do they have names?

524
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,560
That's, uh, Claudia Schiffer,
Cindy Crawford, and Naomi Campbell.

525
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:14,320
In my day, it was Rita Hayworth,
Betty Grable, and Lana Turner.

526
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,160
Mean anything to you?

527
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,440
- No.
- No, of course not.

528
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,160
That was reckless.

529
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:46,040
You went charging in
like some deranged Viking.

530
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:52,840
Oh!

531
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,960
And again.

532
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,120
Oh shit.

533
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,520
Language.

534
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,200
Oh...

535
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,000
Revenge?

536
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
No.

537
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,920
Not when you're in this state.

538
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:14,280
One should never play chess
with one's emotions.

539
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,720
So, what's going on?

540
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,880
Family.

541
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,280
Oh, family.

542
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,880
Psychologists are fairly evenly split

543
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:36,240
between those who think a child should
never be separated from its family

544
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:40,640
and those who think the sooner
it's rescued from its family the better.

545
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,880
It's not everyone in the family.

546
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,200
It's just you-know-who.

547
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,800
Yes, well,

548
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,960
before we talk about you and your father...

549
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,320
I'm assuming it's your father.

550
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,280
...I want to talk to you
about something else.

551
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,000
Back pain.

552
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,400
- What?
- I get it from time to time.

553
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,240
And when I do,
I find it easier to label it just that.

554
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,120
Back pain or neck pain or shoulder pain.

555
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:14,440
Rather than what's actually causing it.

556
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,880
Unresolved anger.

557
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,680
Feelings of guilt.

558
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,680
Or resentment.

559
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,920
I don't resent him.

560
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,880
He resents me.

561
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,760
Oh, no, for what it's worth,
I don't think that's true.

562
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,120
But maybe you're angry with your father

563
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,880
because it's more acceptable
than admitting

564
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,680
who you're really angry with.

565
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:51,320
It occurred to me when I was... watching you
in Greenwich with all those girls.

566
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,720
And then in Toronto.

567
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:54,720
Vancouver.

568
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:59,400
All of a sudden, you've become
a public figure. Public property.

569
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,040
And that isn't easy.

570
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,320
I hate it.

571
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,600
All the screaming and the shouting
and all the attention.

572
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,240
It's as if they think because I...

573
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,720
look like her, I'm <i>like</i> her.

574
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,200
You're not remotely like her.

575
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,400
I know that.

576
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:32,320
So, is it possible you're angry with her
for having been all the things you're not?

577
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,440
Comfortable in the spotlight.

578
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,560
Confident in front of an adoring crowd,

579
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,720
which you think you now have to be.

580
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,600
- And hate.
<i>- </i>  Hmm.

581
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,840
And is it possible
you're angry with her because,

582
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,360
well, because of her leaving you?

583
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,320
And leaving you to deal with that legacy?

584
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,560
Except,

585
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,920
what son can ever be angry
with his mother?

586
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:13,960
Especially when he's grieving... for her

587
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,520
and missing her so terribly.

588
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,440
So you take it out on someone else.

589
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,840
And blame him

590
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,520
for the fact that she's gone.

591
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:43,240
An accusation I'm sure
he's leveled at himself a hundred times.

592
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:46,680
As have we all.

593
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,120
But it's not our fault.

594
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,160
And it's not his fault.

595
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,040
And one day,

596
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,720
when you're a father

597
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:12,320
and your own son is staring at you
with murderous eyes,

598
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,280
and you're praying for his forgiveness,

599
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,960
as your father is
currently praying for yours...

600
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,960
...and as I have on

601
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,040
shamefully too few occasions
prayed for his...

602
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,120
well...

603
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,680
maybe remember this chat.

604
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,560
Off you go.

605
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,600
- Is my father in his study?
- In the garden, sir.

606
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:26,600
Thank you.

607
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:23,840
Hi, Pa.

608
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:25,800
Willy.

609
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,200
What are you doing here, old chap?

610
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,960
I thought you'd be at school.
