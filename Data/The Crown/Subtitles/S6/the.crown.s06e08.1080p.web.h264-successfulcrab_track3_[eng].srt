00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,640
<i>Yesterday morning,</i>

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,720
<i>at 2.41 a.m.</i>

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,800
<i>at Gen. Eisenhower's headquarters,</i>

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,000
<i>Gen. Jodl, the representative
of the German High Command,</i>

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,080
<i>signed the act of unconditional surrender</i>

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:32,040
<i>of all German land, sea,
and air forces in Europe.</i>

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:39,520
<i>Hostilities will end officially
at one minute after midnight tonight,</i>

8
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,280
<i>Tuesday the 8th of May.</i>

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,160
<i>We may allow ourselves
a brief period of rejoicing.</i>

10
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,800
<i>Today is Victory in Europe Day.</i>

11
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,440
<i>Long live the cause of freedom!</i>

12
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,880
<i>God save the King.</i>

13
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,480
Ready?

14
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,520
Margaret, I'm not sure
this is a good idea.

15
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,120
Come on, the war is over.
We have to celebrate.

16
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,840
What if something goes wrong?

17
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,480
We'll have Porchey
and Peter Townsend with us.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,720
What could possibly go wrong?

19
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,520
We're escaping from the Palace!

20
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,080
Quick! Out the servants' door
before anyone sees us!

21
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,360
- We can't just break out like this.
- Oh, shush! Hurry up.

22
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,800
Come on, girls.

23
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,000
Oh, hold your noses!

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,920
Why?

25
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,360
It stinks of alcohol!

26
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,080
And sweat!

27
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,720
It smells of life!

28
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,240
Now, Green Park or Trafalgar Square?

29
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,920
I say the Ritz.
It's where all the most elegant people go.

30
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,800
- And it's in <i>Jeeves and Wooster.</i>
- Good plan. The Ritz it is.

31
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,000
- Shouldn't we be in sight of the Palace?
- Why? So we can wave to Mummy and Papa?

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,480
Honestly, what's the matter with you?
Can't you be irresponsible just once?

33
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,480
Margaret.

34
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,360
Margaret.

35
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,480
Oh!

36
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,760
Next week

37
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,000
is May the 8th.

38
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,080
Do you know, it's been over 50 years,

39
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,520
and we've never done anything
to commemorate it?

40
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,240
What are you talking about?

41
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,920
As sovereign,

42
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,840
I attend VE Day celebrations every year.

43
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,480
No, I mean <i>our</i> VE Day.

44
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,120
It was quite a night.

45
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,160
Do you remember?

46
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,560
- Of course I remember.
<i>- </i>  We almost lost you.

47
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,520
And then we very much found you.

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,160
The <i>real</i> you.

49
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,960
The you that you gave up
in order to be the other you.

50
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,200
Yes, all right.

51
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,920
Don't you miss her? She was so much fun!

52
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,480
<i>♪ Oh, it ain't my fault ♪</i>

53
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,520
<i>♪ Oh, it ain't my fault ♪</i>

54
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,040
And as I recall,

55
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,640
we swore to keep
the events of that evening

56
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,160
secret.

57
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,360
Gin.

58
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,760
Well done.

59
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,880
Revenge?

60
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,160
I can't, I'm afraid.

61
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,080
Early start.

62
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,320
I'm expected
in Clapham Junction first thing.

63
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,400
Whatever for?

64
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,640
Something to do with...

65
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,160
the local council's
closed circuit television system.

66
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,160
- Do you not have anything tomorrow?
- No.

67
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,560
But

68
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,200
Mustique soon.

69
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,760
At the weekend.

70
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,320
Good.

71
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,160
Why?

72
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,440
I always think
that's where you're happiest.

73
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,560
Come on, dogs. Come on.

74
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,680
<i>Green with lust
And sick with shyness</i>

75
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,120
<i>Let me lick your lacquered toes</i>

76
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,920
<i>Gosh! Oh gosh, Your Royal Highness!</i>

77
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,160
<i>Put your finger</i>...

78
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,280
<i>...up my nose</i>

79
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,000
John Betjeman was so mad for me

80
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,360
that his friend Maurice Bowra wrote
this filthy poem about it.

81
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,760
<i>Pin your teeth upon my dress</i>

82
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,880
<i>Plant my head with watercress</i>

83
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,960
<i>Only you can make me happy</i>

84
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,160
<i>Wrap me in a woolen nappy</i>

85
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,080
Ma'am?

86
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,160
<i>In--</i>

87
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,800
<i>In a plush and...</i>

88
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,960
<i>...plated pram</i>

89
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,760
<i>Wheel me round St. James', ma'am</i>

90
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,480
<i>Let your--</i>

91
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,480
Ma'am?

92
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,840
<i>Let your--</i>

93
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,600
- Ma'am?
- Is she all right?

94
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,680
<i>Sleek and soft galoshes</i>

95
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,480
<i>Slide and slither on my skin</i>

96
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,040
Let go!

97
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,280
<i>Princess Margaret, Your Majesty.</i>

98
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,040
<i>Hello?</i>

99
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,400
Margaret. What on earth happened?

100
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,640
I'm afraid
I had a teeny, tiny stroke.

101
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,240
All a bit of a shock.

102
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,440
<i>One minute, I'm in full flow
at the Lawrences',</i>

103
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,400
and the next minute,
I'm in an air ambulance,

104
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,840
unable to... feel my arms and legs.

105
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,680
Where are you now?

106
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,840
<i>In hospital.</i>

107
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,520
In Barbados.

108
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,240
<i>Right.</i>

109
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,760
<i>You poor thing.</i>

110
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,880
The doctors

111
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,120
assure me I'm... going to be fine.

112
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,720
What? I can't hear you properly.

113
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,560
<i>That's because my mouth is still numb.</i>

114
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,800
I could bite off my own tongue,
and I wouldn't feel a thing.

115
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,880
<i>Are we bringing you home?</i>

116
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:18,160
Yes, tomorrow, apparently.
For... further tests.

117
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,600
And edible food.

118
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,000
With any luck.

119
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,600
<i>I'm smiling</i>

120
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,960
<i>as I say that.</i>

121
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,960
Not that you'd notice.

122
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,040
Well, goodbye, Lilibet.

123
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,560
<i>See you tomorrow.</i>

124
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,040
Oh.

125
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,600
<i>I'm happy to say
the stroke was relatively mild, ma'am,</i>

126
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,560
<i>and we ought to be able
to treat the condition effectively</i>

127
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,840
<i>with just an aspirin a day
to, uh, thin the blood,</i>

128
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,160
along with statins
to reduce your cholesterol

129
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,560
and atenolol to lower your blood pressure.

130
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,560
Righto.

131
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,920
But, uh... these alone
will not be enough, ma'am,

132
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,520
to prevent the risk
of a second, more serious stroke.

133
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,520
You will need to look more closely
at your lifestyle.

134
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,880
And... make one or two modifications.

135
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,280
<i>So,</i>

136
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,840
no more Chesterfields.

137
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,480
No more whiskey.

138
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,440
No more sweet treats.

139
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,320
Just lemon barley water...

140
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,520
Mmm.

141
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,880
...nicotine gum,

142
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,800
and lots of

143
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,560
"rehabilitation exercises."

144
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,160
No, I'm not an invalid.

145
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,360
<i>A flea and a fly in a flue</i>

146
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,680
were imprisoned, so what could they do?

147
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,520
So they flew--

148
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,840
<i>♪ If you had prepared 20 years ago ♪</i>

149
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,400

Mm.

Mmm... Mm-hmm. Mm.
<i>♪ Like some other men do? ♪</i>

158

<i>♪ Like some other men do? ♪</i>

Oh!

160
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,280
Oh.

161
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,920
Bad time? Good time?

162
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,960
Mm.

163
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,520
Honestly,

164
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:08,600
I take a nap, and everyone thinks
I've kicked the bucket.

165
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,960
And now you arrive,
unannounced, with anxious looks.

166
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,240
I just wanted to see how you are.

167
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,120
I'm well.

168
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,040
Thank you.

169
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,560
Of course you are.

170
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,840
But I do hope you're taking it easy.

171
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,040
And canceling official engagements?

172
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,200
Some of them, yes.

173
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,240
No need to cancel all of them.

174
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,240
You know how I hate an empty diary.

175
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,280
See?

176
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,320
There's that look again!

177
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,200
I'm fine, Lilibet.

178
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,080
Bouncing back, on the way up.

179
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,040
<i>Not</i> on the way out.

180
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,560
- Ma'am.
<i>- </i>  Thank you.

181
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,400
Hmm.

182
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,720
- Anne.
- Ah.

183
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,800
- Your Royal Highness.
- Mm.

184
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,800
Thank you.

185
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,640
I thought perhaps

186
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,640
a gentle stroll, nice siesta,

187
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,240
and then dinner on the terrace,
just the two of us.

188
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,200
Stroll, yes.

189
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:44,160
But then I'd like a picnic on the beach
with the whole gang,

190
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,880
cocktails at the Cotton Club, and dinner,

191
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,960
followed by general bacchanalia
at Basil's.

192
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,040
I'm only here for two weeks.

193
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,120
I intend to make the most of it.

194
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,880
All right.

195
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,120
You're the boss.

196
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,120
I most

197
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,200
certainly am.

198
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,440
Ma'am?

199
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,480
Ma'am? Can you hear me?

200
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,200
Ma'am? Help!

201
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,880
Thank you.

202
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,000
That's okay.

203
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,360
Yes.

204
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:39,120
The doctor saw instantly
that I'd had another stroke,

205
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,840
but that, as it turns out,
was the least of my problems.

206
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:49,680
Because even after he'd... stabilized me
with a cocktail of drugs,

207
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,760
the soles of my feet were so burnt,

208
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,840
it meant I couldn't stand,
never mind walk.

209
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,800
Then why didn't you come home sooner?

210
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:03,240
Because all manner
of humiliating preparations

211
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,760
needed to be made.

212
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:10,400
The car had to be specially modified.

213
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,400
Handrails put all over the place

214
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,920
like a home for geriatrics.

215
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,800
I don't have handrails anywhere.

216
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,480
Now I'm back,

217
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,920
the doctors want to use leeches on my feet

218
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,240
as an... as an ant--

219
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,280
an ant--

220
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,480
anticoagulant.

221
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,600
Her voice is a little odd.
What is she saying?

222
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,200
I think it was "anticoagulant."

223
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,720
They've given me
these Velcro slippers instead of shoes.

224
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,840
Gone are the days of heels!

225
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,120
Gone are the days of feet,
for that matter.

226
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,840
Why not try some gentle exercise?

227
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,080
You could use the Palace pool.
Exercise can help with moods too.

228
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,600
I'd rather die
than do exercise.

229
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,600
And,

230
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,960
seeing as
I'm going to be dead soon anyway,

231
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,560
I thought I might as well
go out with a bang.

232
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,080
It's my 70th birthday this year,

233
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:19,000
and I've decided I want to celebrate it
with a nice, big party.

234
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,120
What?

235
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,720
At the Ritz.

236
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,360
Because we love the Ritz.
Don't we, Lilibet?

237
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,480
Do we?

238
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,560
We do.

239
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,760
We have such special memories.

240
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,720
<i>♪ Oh, it ain't my fault ♪</i>

241
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,560
<i>♪ Oh, it ain't my fault ♪</i>

242
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,840
Have I missed something?

243
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,000
Look at how I'm dressed.
Do you think they will let us in?

244
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,840
Of course. Just tell them who you are.

245
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,960
That is the one thing
I am not going to do.

246
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,280
Then you're going to have to
bat your eyelids a little.

247
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,080
Go on.

248
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,360
Evening, miss. Through you go!

249
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,040
- Ah...
- Oh. Uh...

250
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,720
- I--
- Only pulling your leg, sir.

251
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,720
- Thank you.
- In you go.

252
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,880
Will you look at that.

253
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,200
Well, what do we do now?

254
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,960
Dive in, I suppose.

255
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,360
- Miss.
- Yes, please.

256
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,080
Cheers, big ears.

257
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,720
Cheers!

258
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,640
I'm going to put this in the cloakroom.

259
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,480
- Oh, let me escort you.
- No need.

260
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,600
Hello, miss.

261
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,320
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

262
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,040
{\an8}- Pass you that.
- Thanks.

263
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,400
Whoa.

264
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,720
Excuse me, ma'am.

265
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,000
Sorry. Have a nice evening.

266
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,120
Wait. Don't go up there.

267
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,120
Come with us.

268
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,840
Way more fun.

269
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,200
I wouldn't go down there if I were you.

270
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,760
Americans.

271
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,040
Ever heard of the jitterbug?

272
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,160
- I know about the doodlebug.
- It's a dance.

273
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,320
Banned here. And with good reason.

274
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,840
- It comes from Harlem.
- From where?

275
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,480
A ghetto. In New York.

276
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,720
Wait.

277
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,800
Don't I recognize you?

278
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,600
No, I don't think so.

279
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,480
Right.

280
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,480
I'll be off.

281
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,360
- Will you make my apologies?
- I will.

282
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:02,480
And wish the birthday girl
a very happy birthday.

283
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,840
I will.

284
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,120
You taking anyone?

285
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,040
Anne. And Porchey will be there.

286
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,000
Ah. Good old Porchey.

287
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,400
Yes, good old Porchey.

288
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,360
Always good company, never lets one down.

289
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,240
Is everything all right?

290
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:23,960
Sorry.

291
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,280
I just find myself
worrying about Margaret all the time.

292
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,920
Oh, well, hasn't it always been like that?

293
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,000
- Yes.
- Hm.

294
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,160
I suppose it has.

295
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,320
Mm.

296
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,760
Sorry, ma'am.

297
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,840
Mm.

298
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,920
Go on.

299
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,880
Margaret!

300
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,920
- Do you need a hand, ma'am?
- I'm all right.

301
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:39,160
- How are you feeling now, ma'am?
- Have you recovered, Your Royal Highness?

302
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,520
Are you still
smoking cigarettes, ma'am?

303
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,080
How are you feeling?

304
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,480
- I just wish you were there.
- Yeah, I know.

305
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,160
Thank you all for coming this evening.

306
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,000
As you know,

307
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:17,280
I've spent much of my time recently
lying in hospital beds

308
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,480
or sitting in wheelchairs,

309
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,400
staring out of windows at that

310
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:30,240
little patch of blue
that prisoners call the sky.

311
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,440
But

312
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,080
one thing that...

313
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,440
throughout it all sustained me.

314
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,160
- Memories.
- Mm.

315
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,720
As it turns out, I have

316
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:56,000
rather fond memories
of quite a few evenings at the Ritz...

317
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,240
...that I'd like to share with you.

318
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,840
One, in particular,

319
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,000
comes to mind,

320
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,200
when a very different side

321
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:13,120
of the young Princess Elizabeth
was revealed.

322
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,120
And I'm sure
everyone would love to hear about that.

323
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,040
Yes, they would, Lilibet,

324
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,800
which is why I'm telling it.

325
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,360
It would miss the point entirely
of why we're all here tonight.

326
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,160
To celebrate <i>you.</i>

327
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,040
Hear, hear.

328
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,440
As a child, I felt sorry for children
who didn't have a brother or a sister.

329
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,840
From the day she was born,

330
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,920
Margaret Rose has been
my constant companion.

331
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,160
Rarely able to see other children,
we relied on one another, and,

332
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,480
like Juno's swans, we were inseparable.

333
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,360
We... we shared a room,

334
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,480
wore the same clothes,
enjoyed the same activities.

335
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,880
In particular,

336
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:08,080
managing our collection
of wooden horses on wheels...

337
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,720
...that we would groom and water and race.

338
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,240
True.

339
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,080
And whenever we got into trouble,

340
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,120
Margaret would blame everything
on her imaginary friend, Cousin Halifax.

341
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,080
Oh, yes, I would.

342
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,040
No, there really wasn't anything
Cousin Halifax wouldn't do.

343
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:31,400
Sounding the air raid bell
to wake the guards.

344
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,280
Hiding the gardener's tools.
He really was very mischievous.

345
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,680
It's not always easy,

346
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,600
growing up in a family
where one person has to wear the crown,

347
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,080
being the number two.

348
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,400
But Margaret has been my ally,
day in, day out.

349
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,000
And that is the person
I wanted to tell you about tonight.

350
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,080
Not the dazzling,
you all know that already.

351
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,680
But the dutiful.

352
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,680
Never wavering.

353
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:08,000
My lifelong companion and support

354
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,800
without whom...

355
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,000
well...

356
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,960
it would be unimaginable.

357
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,640
Dearest Margaret...

358
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,640
many happy returns.

359
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,520
Happy birthday, Margaret.

360
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:38,000
- Happy birthday, Margaret.
- Happy birthday.

361
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,280
I don't know
whether to be touched or cross.

362
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,080
<i>Why?</i>

363
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:48,120
I've always wanted to
sing your praises in public.

364
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,160
Well,

365
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,680
it was both uncalled for

366
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,640
and rather thrilling.

367
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,320
Everyone is being so nice.

368
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,600
One should be seriously ill more often.

369
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,720
Listen to that cough.
You haven't started smoking again?

370
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,520
No, of course not.

371
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,560
That was

372
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,160
Cousin Halifax.

373
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,040
Good night, Lilibet.

374
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,120
<i>Good night.</i>

375
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,680
Mm.

376
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,600
Oh...

377
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,440
Oh...

378
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,440
Oh...

379
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,120
Mm...

380
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,680
Mm...

381
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,480
Hello, you.

382
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,640
Mm.

383
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,080
And... goodbye, you.

384
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,080
Stop it.

385
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,280
We'll have you up
and out of here in no time.

386
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,360
No.

387
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:42,080
I'm afraid it's... serious this time.

388
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,120
I can feel it.

389
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,280
Or can't feel it, more like.

390
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,720
I can't feel anything.

391
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,640
Or see anything.

392
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,560
My body's...

393
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,640
deserting me, one limb at a time.

394
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,960
The doctors tell me you aren't eating.

395
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,080
I'm

396
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,600
really not hungry.

397
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,840
Well, I brought you these.

398
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,160
Your favorite.

399
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,000
Jam tarts.

400
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,840
Now you're talking.

401
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,800
And...

402
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,560
a very pretty

403
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,880
walking stick.

404
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,080
For when you're back on your feet.

405
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,120
<i>We're on the air
with a special program</i>

406
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:26,480
<i>to bring you an update
on the appalling and incredible events</i>

407
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,920
<i>that were played out today
in the United States.</i>

408
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,320
<i>A day when terrorists struck
at the very heart</i>

409
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,560
<i>of the world's most powerful country.</i>

410
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:36,280
<i>A day of unimaginable chaos and confusion.</i>

411
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,440
<i>A day when untold thousands
were feared dead.</i>

412
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,120
<i>The terrorists' weapons,
four hijacked passenger planes.</i>

413
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:46,640
<i>Two crashed with awful effect
into the World Trade Center in New York,</i>

414
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,480
<i>the third into the Pentagon in Washington,</i>

415
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,280
<i>the fourth in Pennsylvania.</i>

416
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,440
<i>America spends
billions of dollars every year</i>

417
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,520
<i>gathering and assessing
intelligence reports</i>

418
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,640
<i>to prevent attacks like these...</i>

419
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,040
"A San Francisco husband

420
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:08,600
slept through his wife's call
from the World Trade Center."

421
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:13,360
"She left her last message to him
on the answering machine."

422
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:18,720
"There was really only one thing left
for her to say. 'I love you.'"

423
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:23,080
"She said it over and over
before the line went dead."

424
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,640
"And then

425
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
oblivion."

426
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,880
So sad.

427
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,040
And such terrible news
about Lord Carnarvon too.

428
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,280
Porchey?

429
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,960
Why? What's happened?

430
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,120
He collapsed
while he was watching the news.

431
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,080
Heart attack.

432
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,800
Poor Jean.

433
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,520
Poor you too.

434
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,600
He was such a special friend.

435
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,520
He would bring horse news, which is
the only news I ever really want to hear.

436
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,520
Used to hold up his mobile phone
when horse bidding was underway

437
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,040
so I could hear the action.

438
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,280
He was devoted to you.

439
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:27,240
And now all those closest to you
are abandoning you one by one.

440
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,120
What are you talking about?

441
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,280
Porchey.

442
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,760
Yes.

443
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,200
Mummy. Soon.

444
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,680
Yes.

445
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,200
- Me.
- Don't you dare.

446
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,800
It's the truth.

447
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:46,640
I'm not thrilled about it.
In fact, I'm furious about it.

448
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,280
I'm not ready
to leave this particular party.

449
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,120
But we need to discuss it.

450
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,640
I've written a very detailed plan
for my funeral.

451
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:03,040
You know what a planner I am.

452
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:09,240
And I want your reassurance
that it will go exactly as I intend.

453
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,000
Mm.

454
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,920
I want to wear my flower dress,

455
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,920
not some horrid black thing.

456
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:25,040
And please don't let them
put red lipstick on me.

457
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,200
For the chapel, I want roses and tulips,

458
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:35,320
and I want the finale to <i>Swan Lake</i>

459
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,640
playing on the organ as people arrive.

460
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,040
And one more thing.

461
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,880
Very important.

462
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,560
Yes, of course.

463
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,920
Promise me

464
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:55,920
that I will actually be dead
when they close the coffin.

465
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,760
Oh, for--

466
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,440
Oh, Mar--

467
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,160
"'Bertie, old egg,' said young Eustace."

468
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,480
"'Fancy meeting you here.'"

469
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,440
"'The one man in London who can support us
in the style we're accustomed to.'"

470
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:19,520
"'Oh, by the way,
you've never met old Dog-Face, have you?'"

471
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,680
"'Dog-Face, this is my cousin Bertie.'"

472
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,600
Hm.

473
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,680
Is this silly?

474
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,880
No, it's wonderful. Go on.

475
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,520
"'What are you doing in London?' I asked."

476
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:36,200
"'Oh, buzzing round.
We're just up for the day."

477
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,120
"'Flying visit, strictly unofficial.'"

478
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,080
"'We oil back on the 3:10.'"

479
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,360
"'We oil back on the 3:10.'"

480
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:51,280
"'And now, touching on that lunch
you very decently volunteered to stand us,

481
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,480
which shall it be? Ritz, Savoy, Carlton?'"

482
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,080
Ritz, please.

483
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,040
Because we love the Ritz, don't we?

484
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,160
Honestly! You and The Ritz.

485
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,200
No!

486
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,560
<i>You</i> and The Ritz.

487
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:11,200
If people don't know about that night,
they'll never fully understand.

488
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,040
How irresponsible I was?

489
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:17,320
The scale of the sacrifice you've made.

490
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,960
How much of your true self
you've locked up.

491
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,720
Hidden away.

492
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:31,840
You caused...
havoc that night.

493
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,960
It was the end of the war.

494
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,400
Now...

495
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,720
{\an8}you rest.

496
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,880
You came.

497
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,480
Actually, I'm with friends upstairs.
I really should go.

498
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,400
Why?

499
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,200
Down here is the place to be.

500
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,800
And why is that?

501
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,880
Because down here,
there's no rank or background.

502
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,760
Just music.

503
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,160
Well, in that case...

504
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,760
<i>♪ Well, no, it ain't my fault ♪</i>

519
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,120
And all the chaps had a little bit of...

520
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,120
You two haven't seen Elizabeth, have you?

521
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:16,080
Stop worrying about her.
She never does anything irresponsible.

522
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:19,280
She's been a long time.
I'm going to look for her.

523
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,560
I'll come with you, Porchey.

524
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,400
All right, wait for me.

Let's get her out of here.

532

No, don't!

533
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:09,640
Leave her.

534
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,000

You dark horse.

Who'd have known you could jive.

544
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,240
There must have been
50 men chasing you out.

545
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,480
- Don't exaggerate.
- What?

546
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,960
I said don't exaggerate.

547
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:50,920
It's hard to talk.

548
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,200
When you're sloshed?

549
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,360
When you're chewing gum.

550
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,720
When did you get that?

551
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,120
Well, I'm not sure.

552
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:03,440
I think it might have come after a kiss.

553
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,800
- Lilibet!
- Well, I didn't intend to kiss him.

554
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:09,320
It's just what everyone else was doing,
and I didn't want to be rude.

555
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,800
I think Porchey might have seen
and got a bit cross.

556
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,280
Oh dear.

557
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,440
Look.

558
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,400
The blossom's out.

559
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:33,880
Yes.

560
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:36,240
The sun is rising.

00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,280
What will this future hold

562
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:44,920
for us all?

563
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:52,880
Aren't you coming?

564
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,720
We can join Mummy and Papa for breakfast.

565
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:00,800
I'm afraid not.

566
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:07,040
But I will always... be by your side.
