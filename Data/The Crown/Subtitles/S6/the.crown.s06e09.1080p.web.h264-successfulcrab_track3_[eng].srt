1
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,920
Let us clear the set, please.

2
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,760
<i>Mohamed Al Fayed,</i>

3
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,080
<i>it has been more than four years
since the car crash</i>

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,760
<i>that tragically cut short
the life of your son and Princess Diana.</i>

5
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,040
<i>In that time, there have been
autopsies, coroner's reports,</i>

6
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,640
{\an8}not to mention a two-year investigation
led by a judge in France,

7
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,240
{\an8}all concluding that it was an accident.

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,480
{\an8}And yet you still refuse
to let this issue rest. Why?

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,440
Because it was not an accident.

10
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,960
It was murder.

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,040
Slaughter.

12
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,040
Committed by whom?

13
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,800
The Dracula British royal family.

14
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,320
These people are gangsters.

15
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,360
Terrorists.

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,680
When they discovered Princess Diana
was pregnant with a Muslim child,

17
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,080
they killed her.

18
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,920
So, the British royal family?

19
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,280
Not them personally.

20
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,160
Their intelligence services.
MI5, MI6, MI7.

21
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,840
All the James Bonds.

22
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,360
They murdered
that beautiful, innocent girl and my Dodi

23
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,480
with special military equipment
and flashing lights.

24
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,160
I have new evidence.

25
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,800
Expert witnesses and CCTV tapes.

26
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,640
And I will have my justice.

27
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:45,680
In recent weeks, Mr. Al Fayed has
spoken to NBC, CNN, ITV, and the BBC.

28
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,840
Not to mention <i>The Mirror</i>, which he has
used as a frequent forum for his views,

29
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,400
and it seems that sympathy
for his crackpot theories

30
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,600
has been growing.

31
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:02,360
One poll alleges that 78% of Britons
now believe some element of foul play

32
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,480
may have been involved in the crash.

33
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,880
Another makes the claim that 89%
now think it might have been murder.

34
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,800
So I'm afraid I don't think
we've heard the last of this.

35
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,200
<i>An official police inquiry
into the death of Princess Diana</i>

36
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,560
<i>was announced today.</i>

37
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,120
<i>This follows calls to re-examine
the circumstances around her death</i>

38
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,880
<i>in a car crash in August 1997.</i>

39
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,840
<i>The inquiry will be code-named
Operation Paget,</i>

40
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,920
<i>and it will be led by
the Metropolitan Police commissioner,</i>

41
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,240
<i>Sir John Stevens.</i>

42
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,400
<i>The announcement was
welcomed by Mohamed Al Fayed,</i>

43
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,960
<i>whose son, Dodi, also died in the crash.</i>

44
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,840
<i>Mr. Al Fayed has previously alleged
the involvement of the French police,</i>

45
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,760
<i>British intelligence services,</i>

46
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,840
<i>and the royal family in a cover-up.</i>

47
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,280
<i>Also, that the princess was pregnant
at the time of her death,</i>

48
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,440
<i>leading to speculation
that, as part of the investigation,</i>

49
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,360
<i>her body could be exhumed.</i>

50
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,760
<i>Opponents did not wait long
to express their anger,</i>

51
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,840
<i>saying the inquiry
threatens to open up old wounds,</i>

52
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,840
<i>expressing their concern, in particular,
for the princes William and Harry</i>

53
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,880
<i>at the thought they would have to relive
the trauma all over again.</i>

54
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,560
<i>Those poor boys.</i>

55
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,200
Will this subject never rest?

56
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,640
I suspect not while
it continues to sell newspapers

57
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,880
in the numbers it does,

58
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,560
which doesn't bode well
for my upcoming jubilee.

59
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,640
Mm.

60
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,280
The planning committee came today
with their latest suggestions.

61
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,520
Bigger than ever. My heart sank.

62
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,600
I keep telling them,
the timing is not right.

63
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,960
At this moment,
people don't want to celebrate me.

64
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,720
They're sick of me, quite frankly.

65
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,480
Better not to provoke them
with any grand displays.

66
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,480
But the list went on and on.

67
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,560
Mummy?

68
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,240
Don't go, please.

69
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,880
You can't leave me alone with it all.

70
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,880
Am I disturbing?

71
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,800
In so many ways.

72
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,400
I come with good news,
then more good news and even better news.

73
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,800
A little bit of bad news. What's first?

74
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,560
The good news.

75
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,080
Kate Middleton...

76
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,120
And you notice
I pause here for dramatic effect...

77
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,240
Go on.

78
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,480
...is single again.

79
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,120
That <i>is</i> good news.

80
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,080
The more good news is, she's modelling

81
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,800
in some university fashion show
this evening.

82
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,480
And I happen to know
the people organizing it.

83
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,680
And the even better news is,

84
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,600
I've been assured
that the tone of the show is...

85
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,680
risqué.

86
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,400
As in racy.

87
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,720
And outrageous!

88
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,640
Yeah, I know what risqué means.

89
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,960
So, what's the bad news?

90
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,400
The bad news is,
some local newspaper's been invited,

91
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,680
so your protection officer
will never let you go.

92
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,200
Fuck that.

93
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,320
I like your style.

94
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,240
No.

95
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,760
Seriously.

96
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,560
Fuck that.

97
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,760
Well, apparently
William's definitely coming.

98
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,280
<i>How do you know?</i>

99
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,840
He texted a friend in strict confidence,

100
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,840
<i>who texted another in strict confidence,</i>

101
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,120
<i>so pretty soon the whole place knew.</i>

102
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,080
<i>Better make sure
you don't fall over, then.</i>

103
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,840
<i>Heels, not flats.
You still wanna show off those legs.</i>

104
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,560
It's our duty to make use
of the assets God has given us.

105
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,120
- <i>Really?
- </i> Does he know you're back on the market?

106
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,040
Mum!

107
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,920
<i>Well, maybe find a way
of letting him know.</i>

108
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,480
Honestly, you're worse than Mrs. Bennet.

109
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,840
<i>Got to go. Bye.</i>

110
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,600

Does he always stare at you like that?

143
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,640
Only when he wants to kill me.

144
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:03,040
Which, for someone paid to keep me alive,
is more often than you'd think.

145
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,760
That was quite the outfit earlier.

146
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,760
Did you like it?

147
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,760
Like?

148
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,120
You looked incredible.

149
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,040
I just felt like doing something drastic.

150
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,120
To know,

151
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,400
one way or another...

152
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,320
What?

153
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,000
If you were interested.

154
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,760
Really? If I was interested?

155
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,720
Yes.

156
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,960
- Hello?
- Of course I'm interested.

157
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,920
I thought you weren't interested.
I thought I'd blown it in the library.

158
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,000
I'd started to worry
we'd drifted into the dreaded friend zone.

159
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,280
Oh no, I'd hate that.

160
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,400
So would I.

161
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,840
I've always been interested.

162
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,360
- Really?
- Bordering on obsessed.

163
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,520
To the point where
I thought if I couldn't be with you...

164
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,120
I'd sooner not be here at all.

165
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,160
Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to interrupt.

166
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,480
Can't I be allowed a private life
for one minute?

167
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,240
I'm afraid this can't wait, sir.

168
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,800
Operation Tay Bridge.

169
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,520
I'm really sorry.

170
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,280
<i>Oh, God of grace</i>

171
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,000
<i>I'm going now into the sleep</i>

172
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,160
<i>Be it that I in health shall wake</i>

173
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,720
<i>If death be to me in deathly sleep</i>

174
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,240
<i>Be it that in thine own arms keep</i>

175
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,080
<i>Oh, God of grace</i>

176
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,360
<i>To new life I wake</i>

177
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,440
<i>Oh, be it in thy dear arms keep</i>

178
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,480
<i>Oh, God of grace</i>

179
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,680
<i>That I shall awake</i>

180
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,720
Chin up.

181
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:36,040
- An extraordinary woman.
- Will you go check on Harry?

182
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,880
- My sincere and deepest condolences.
- Yes. Thank you. Thank you.

183
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,560
You all right?

184
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,760
- Can't say I'm looking forward to today.
- No.

185
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,200
We seem to do nothing
<i>but</i> go to funerals in this family.

186
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,400
Tell me about it.

187
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,560
Funerals are supposed to help
lay things to rest.

188
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,440
Now they're dredging up Mummy's accident,
all because of Al Fayed's crazy claims.

189
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,520
I know. And this time,
they even wanna interview me.

190
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,640
What for?

191
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,080
To determine Mummy's state of mind.

192
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,160
And why you?

193
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:19,240
Probably because I was older than you
at the time, more able to understand.

194
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,200
But I'm actually going through
what she went through on a daily basis.

195
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,640
Who gets picked on
and slagged off in the press,

196
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,120
so I know better than you
what it feels like.

197
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,400
- Don't ever do that.
- What?

198
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,160
Compare yourself to her.

199
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,240
- It's not remotely the same.
- Isn't it?

200
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,720
What she went through was far worse.

201
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,440
I get it. It's not easy
having no responsibility

202
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,680
and too much freedom,
but don't you think I'd enjoy the freedom

203
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,000
of not having to be the sensible one?
The reliable one?

204
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,880
And welcome the opportunity
to be the likable rogue.

205
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,120
- No chance.
- Why's that?

206
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,800
To be a likable rogue,
you first need to be likable.

207
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:08,680
<i>♪ Guide me, O thou great Redeemer ♪</i>

208
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:14,240
<i>♪ Pilgrim through this barren land ♪</i>

209
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,600
<i>♪ I am weak, but thou art mighty ♪</i>

210
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:25,320
<i>♪ Hold me with thy powerful hand ♪</i>

211
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:30,920
<i>♪ Bread of heaven, bread of heaven ♪</i>

212
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:43,520
<i>♪ Feed me now and evermore ♪</i>

213
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:50,080
<i>♪ Open thou the crystal fountain... ♪</i>

214
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,280
Sorry, that was dickish of me.

215
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,480
Come on, don't make me grovel.

216
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,440
It's okay.

217
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,240
Let's move on.

218
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,280
Everyone's happy
you didn't drop out of uni.

219
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,880
How's it going?

220
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,160
It's fine.

221
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,200
<i>♪ Be thou still my strength and shield... ♪</i>

222
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,280
So, what changed?

223
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,840
<i>♪ When I tread the verge of Jordan ♪</i>

224
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:38,000
<i>♪ Bid my anxious fears subside ♪</i>

225
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:43,680
<i>♪ Death of death, and hell's destruction ♪</i>

226
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,800
So, how was Texas
and President Bush?

227
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,240
Productive. And, uh... convivial.

228
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,600
Top of the agenda was, of course, Iraq.

229
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,520
The Americans believe, and we agree,
that Saddam Hussein has amassed

230
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,720
a vast stockpile
of chemical and biological weapons.

231
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,280
But I stressed that,
while Britain always stands ready

232
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,080
to support her number one ally,

233
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,760
in the case of regime change,
our involvement would be contingent

234
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,200
on securing
a second UN Security Council Resolution.

235
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,640
Saddam must allow
the weapons inspectors back in.

236
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,960
Only if he fails to do that

237
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,520
would he be forced to face
the most severe consequences.

238
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,160
War.

239
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,160
Yeah.

240
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,360
The problem with telling someone
you will always back them

241
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,920
and then making it conditional

242
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,120
is they tend to hear
only the offer of support

243
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,560
and not the conditions.

244
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,200
Nevertheless, I'm pleased
the meeting went well

245
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,480
and grateful to you
for... cutting your trip short

246
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,560
so you could be back
in time for the funeral.

247
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,440
It was a very moving ceremony.

248
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,160
And in the end, a great, um...

249
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,880
a great turnout up and down the country.

250
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,920
People needed no encouragement

251
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,560
to show their... their gratitude
for a remarkable public servant.

252
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,520
It gives one great confidence
for your golden jubilee.

253
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,000
If you felt that confident,
Prime Minister,

254
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,760
why have your colleagues
been suggesting to local councils

255
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,800
that they forego charging
for street parties?

256
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,280
Presumably because the interest
in celebrating was so small.

257
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,920
I honestly see no need for concern, but...

258
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,160
but if one wanted to be 100% sure,

259
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,760
there's sometimes, um...

260
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,880
an advantage in bringing
someone charismatic off the bench,

261
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,840
you know, a super sub to...

262
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,760
uh...

263
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,880
to, uh... expand your appeal.

264
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,720
The Prince of Wales already does so much.

265
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,160
Actually,
I was thinking about Prince William.

266
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,640
He's young, modern, sympathetic.

267
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,000
With enormous star quality.

268
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,520
If I can avoid it,
I don't want to disturb him

269
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,160
at a delicate time
in his university studies.

270
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,360
He's already so upset by the existence
of this police investigation.

271
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,920
I don't see
why they have to stir it all up again.

272
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,840
My understanding is that

273
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,840
since he was the last member
of the family to speak to the princess,

274
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,760
he will be required
at least to give a written statement.

275
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,520
Let's hope
they reach their conclusions quickly,

276
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,000
and we can all move on.

277
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,240
- Commissioner Stevens, welcome.
- Your Royal Highness.

278
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,400
Shall we go in?

279
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,160
<i>Sir, I must warn you,</i>

280
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,720
<i>some of these questions
are going to be difficult.</i>

281
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,240
Did Princess Diana
ever express any fears to you

282
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,640
that senior royals
and British intelligence services

283
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,640
were conspiring to plan
an accident in her car?

284
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,280
No.

285
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,520
Never.

286
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,200
Are you aware of a letter
written by the princess

287
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,800
and discovered by her butler,
Paul Burrell,

288
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,560
in which she wrote of her suspicions

289
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:53,520
that you were plotting
a deliberate brake failure in her vehicle

290
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,600
so as to remove
any obstacles to your remarriage?

291
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,520
What?! No.

292
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,280
We also have a note from
Lord Mishcon, the princess' solicitor,

293
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,240
following a meeting with the princess

294
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,600
and her then private secretary,
Patrick Jephson.

295
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,000
- During the meeting...
- Sir.

296
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:19,760
...she said that unnamed, reliable sources
had informed her of a conspiracy,

297
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,520
the purpose of which
was her murder or incapacitation.

298
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,800
When did she say these things?

299
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,560
We believe she began to
articulate these fears in October 1995.

300
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:34,240
I'm sorry, but you understand
why it is my duty to ask.

301
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,800
Did you ever contribute to any plans
to assassinate the princess?

302
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,520
Of course not.

303
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,920
I honestly had no idea.

304
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:52,040
If I'd known things had got... that bad,
I'd have done something. Immediately.

305
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,800
Helped.

306
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,800
This is terrible.

307
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,480
What a wretched state of mind she must
have been in even to imagine such things.

308
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,080
Can you, um... close the...

309
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,840
Did your sons,
William and Harry...

310
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,480
Your Royal Highness.

311
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,480
Excuse me, sir.
Her Majesty has asked to see you.

312
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,600
<i>You are sweet for coming.</i>

313
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,480
I hope I didn't drag you
all the way from Scotland.

314
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,160
Have I come far, you mean?

315
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,320
Oh yes.

316
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,120
Have you come far?

317
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,080
Granny.

318
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,080
Well, actually, it's...
it's been reading week.

319
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,600
- So I've been at Highgrove for a few days.
- Oh, that must be nice.

320
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,960
It's quite nice.

321
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,040
Though we had the police come in
to ask questions about Mummy

322
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,800
as part of that investigation.

323
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,240
That makes me so cross.

324
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,880
And things aren't too great
between Harry and Pa right now.

325
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,400
Yes, I heard that.
Something about a brawl at a local pub.

326
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,760
More than one. And the wacky baccy.

327
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,400
The what?

328
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,240
The ganja, Granny.

329
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,080
The marijuana?

330
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,080
Oh...

331
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,680
So now, whenever Pa goes away, he insists

332
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:18,240
Harry be sent to a family friend's
to be supervised, which Harry hates.

333
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,720
It's not easy being the number two.

334
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,480
Especially if you have a lot of spirit.

335
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,400
No.

336
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,400
It's not all that easy
being number one either, is it?

337
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,560
Well, you'd know.

338
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:38,000
University should be about having fun
and growing up.

339
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,320
But you can't have fun

340
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,520
when you've got photographers
and police officers with you

341
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,920
wherever you go.

342
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,000
You certainly can't go
on a date with a girl.

343
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,080
Ah, yes, I wanted to ask you
about all that.

344
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:53,120
Or even be seen with one without someone
predicting wedding bells before long.

345
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,080
And there's the other stuff.

346
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,840
What other stuff?

347
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,680
Speculation about how the monarchy,

348
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:05,320
in order to stay popular and relevant,
should skip a generation in favor of me.

349
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,240
Well, that's just nonsense.

350
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,840
Well, I know that. You know that.

351
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,320
But the people don't know that.
They only know what they read.

352
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,240
And then it gets really confusing

353
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,840
because... the more they believe
the rubbish they read,

354
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,800
the more it affects
the way they behave with me, and the more

355
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,280
it ends up becoming my reality somehow.

356
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,800
Yes.

357
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,720
I'm so pleased
you feel able to speak from the heart

358
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,320
and tell me these things.

359
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,920
I also wanted to...

360
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,720
to speak from the heart

361
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,480
and ask for your help
with my golden jubilee.

362
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,680
Because I don't mind admitting
I'm a little apprehensive about it.

363
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,960
Particularly the balcony.

364
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,640
The idea I might step out to no crowds,

365
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,360
just a big, empty space.

366
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,720
Or worse, booing.

367
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,720
And letting everyone down.

368
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,320
- It's never going to happen.
- You say that, but what if it does?

369
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,280
And I had hoped to be able to ask you

370
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,000
as a younger
and more glamorous member of the family

371
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,200
to come in and...

372
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,960
and prop me up.

373
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,040
But in the light of what you've
just told me, I'll say something else.

374
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,040
Stay well clear.

375
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,360
Are you sure?

376
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,080
Before I acceded to the throne,

377
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,360
Philip and I lived in Malta
as a young married couple.

378
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,840
Villa Guardamangia was our home.

379
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,080
Outside Valletta.

380
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,320
Some of the happiest years of my life.

381
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,640
Hm.

382
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,920
I used to go to the grocers, you know,
every day. With all the other wives.

383
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,000
And held dinner parties and picnics.

384
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,480
And went to the local hairdresser.

385
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,680
Out of the spotlight.
Living a perfectly normal life.

386
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,160
I want you to have that too.

387
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,080
As normal a life as possible.
For as long as possible.

388
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,880
- I'm doing my best.
- Good.

389
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,560
And on that note, since you wanted to ask...

390
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,480
Mm-hmm.

391
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,200
- I think I might have a girlfriend.
- Oh.

392
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,800
Well, do you or don't you?

393
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,840
I do.... I think.

394
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,520
It's generally good if they don't feel
you're in two minds.

395
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,040
I'm not in two minds.

396
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,720
She might be in two minds.

397
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,400
Why? Have you aimed high?

398
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,720
Impossibly high.

399
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,880
She could have anyone.

400
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,720
Some might say
you're a bit of a catch too.

401
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,960
- Did you meet her at university?
- Mm.

402
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,640
- Yes. We're on the same course.
- Oh. Is she Scottish?

403
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,440
I'm not sure there are
any real Scots at St. Andrews.

404
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,680
- She's from Berkshire.
- Nothing wrong with that.

405
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:07,320
- It's where we keep most of our horses.
- Her name is Catherine.

406
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,000
- Nothing wrong with that either.
- She wants me to meet her parents.

407
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,040
Mm. Isn't that a bit quick?

408
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,240
Well, not as a commitment thing.

409
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,720
Because... she likes being with them

410
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,680
and wants me to come and... hang out.

411
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,520
How nice.

412
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,240
Apparently, they eat together.

413
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,800
In the kitchen.

414
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,360
Why? Do they not have a dining room?

415
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,080
I think they do. They just--

416
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,840
Prefer to behave like staff?

417
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,160
We'll try not to hold that against them.

418
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,000
Yeah.

419
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,200
<i>Well, I told her all about you.</i>

420
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,720
Wow.

421
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,520
So the Queen knows who I am.

422
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,720
<i>More than that.</i>

423
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,600
She hopes to meet you one day.

424
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,880
<i>Amazing.</i>

425
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,560
Doesn't that terrify you?

426
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,280
Why?

427
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,520
You always say how great she is.

428
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,040
<i>Yeah, I do.</i>

429
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,720
And how protective she is of you.

430
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,000
<i>She really is.</i>

431
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,080
She just gave me a pass
to skip most of the jubilee events.

432
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,040
<i>So, you could come and watch with us?</i>

433
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,160
What, with your family?

434
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,160
You could give a running commentary.

435
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,560
With a unique insight.

436
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,800
Can we see how the next few days go first?
With the police inquiry.

437
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,520
<i>- They're about to publish their findings.
- </i>  Of course.

438
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,280
I didn't realize. I'm so sorry.

439
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,360
It's okay.

440
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,840
<i>I'll be thinking of you.</i>

441
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,600
Good afternoon.

442
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,360
As commissioner
of the Metropolitan Police,

443
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,640
I was asked to conduct a new inquiry

444
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:57,560
into the deaths of Diana,
Princess of Wales, and Dodi Fayed.

445
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,200
This investigation follows
a high-profile campaign

446
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,160
{\an8}by Mohamed Al Fayed,

447
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:06,280
{\an8}in which he accused
members of the British royal family

448
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,520
{\an8}of deliberately causing the accident.

449
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,000
<i>Prior to publication,</i>

450
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,760
<i>I have consulted with Princes William
and Harry about the report's conclusions.</i>

451
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,520
<i>They were given the opportunity
to ask questions and to express concerns,</i>

452
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:26,880
<i>and I assured them that the investigation
was evidence-led at all times.</i>

453
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,960
<i>We have interviewed
over 300 witnesses...</i>

454
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,160
- Welcome to the Ritz.
<i>- </i>  Monsieur Rocher.

455
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,080
<i>...returned to multiple locations...</i>

456
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,320
The Imperial Suite.

457
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:45,000
<i>...to conduct re-examinations,
and using the latest forensic technology,</i>

458
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,880
<i>we have collected and examined
over 600 pieces of evidence,</i>

459
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:53,120
<i>as well as reviewing
hundreds of hours of CCTV footage</i>

460
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,840
<i>in order to reconstruct
the events of that night.</i>

461
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:00,720
I'd like to respond
to some of Mr. Al Fayed's claims.

462
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,280
<i>From the evidence
of close friends and associates,</i>

463
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,480
<i>we learned that the princess
was not engaged,</i>

464
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,920
<i>nor about to get engaged,</i>

465
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,680
<i>nor, indeed, wished to get engaged.</i>

466
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,040
<i>We also found no evidence</i>

467
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,200
<i>that the princess was pregnant
at the time of her death,</i>

468
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,760
<i>and forensic tests carried out on blood
recovered from the Mercedes support this.</i>

469
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:31,200
<i>Another of Mr. Al Fayed's allegations
is that British security services</i>

470
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,640
<i>tampered with the blood sample
of the driver, Henri Paul,</i>

471
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,800
to create a false impression
of high alcohol levels.

472
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:43,320
<i>Our examination of toxicology reports
found no such evidence.</i>

473
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,480
<i>Indeed, several witnesses
saw Monsieur Paul</i>

474
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,800
<i>drinking in the Ritz Hotel
before electing to drive the car.</i>

475
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,840
Mr. Al Fayed has also
made varying allegations

476
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,160
surrounding the role of a white Fiat Uno.

477
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,600
<i>He has alternately claimed</i>

478
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,600
<i>that this vehicle
deliberately blocked the Mercedes' path,</i>

479
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,240
<i>clashed with it directly,</i>

480
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,480
<i>or forced it into pillar 13.</i>

481
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:13,720
<i>And while the Mercedes did have
a close encounter with the Fiat Uno,</i>

482
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:17,560
<i>forensic tests have determined
that this was not the cause of the crash.</i>

483
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,920
<i>Though no video footage exists
from the Pont de l'Alma tunnel,</i>

484
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:28,840
<i>using the latest advances
in 3D computer modeling,</i>

485
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,800
<i>we have been able to reconstruct
what took place.</i>

486
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:36,480
Mr. Al Fayed also alleges
that a bright flash of light

487
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,120
was seen in the tunnel
at the time of the crash,

488
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,760
designed to blind the driver.

489
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:47,000
Even if such a flash had existed,
it would have had little significance,

490
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:53,320
<i>as Monsieur Paul was traveling
at approximately 100 kilometers an hour...</i>

491
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,800
<i>...and had already lost control of the car
prior to entering the tunnel.</i>

492
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,320
{\an8}The most significant factor in the crash

493
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,880
{\an8}was the assignment
of Henri Paul as driver.

494
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,200
{\an8}Not only was he drunk,

495
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,560
{\an8}but he was unqualified
to drive the vehicle

496
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,240
<i>and driving
at twice the legal speed limit.</i>

497
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,200
<i>And to add to the safety risk,</i>

498
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,680
none of the passengers wore a seatbelt.

499
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,840
<i>Mr. Al Fayed has repeatedly insisted</i>

500
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,240
<i>that responsibility
for the princess' death</i>

501
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,480
<i>lies with the British establishment</i>

502
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:39,200
<i>and has amassed a vast legal team
to attempt to prove as much.</i>

503
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,280
<i>But this reaction must be viewed</i>

504
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,640
<i>in the light
of the immense personal heartbreak</i>

505
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,200
<i>and trauma involved in the loss of a son.</i>

506
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,600
<i>Yet the facts remain</i>

507
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,680
that on August 31st, 1997,

508
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,960
Princess Diana was in Paris,

509
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,200
being driven in an Al Fayed car

510
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,320
by a member of Mr. Al Fayed's staff

511
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,240
with bodyguards paid for by Mr. Al Fayed

512
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:15,080
and acting on a last-minute change of plan
instigated by Mr. Al Fayed's son.

513
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,200
This was a series of unfortunate incidents

514
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,720
leading to a tragic accident in a tunnel,

515
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,800
and it is the recommendation
of this inquiry

516
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:33,720
<i>that the princess should finally
be allowed to rest in peace.</i>

517
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,720
"For almost 40 years,

518
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,600
I have lived in the United Kingdom."

519
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:04,880
"Yet I am forced to leave

543
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,160
- Hiya.
- How are you?

544
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,440
- Good. How are you?
- Good. Good to see you.

545
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,640
Good to see you too.

546
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,920
- Thanks for inviting me.
- Thank you for coming.

547
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,040
- Pippa!
- Coming!

548
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,040
Yes. Yes, okay.

549
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,600
- Ready?
- I think so.

550
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,320
- Hello. Welcome.
- Hello.

551
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,440
Hello.

552
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,880
Thank you.

553
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,600
- There you go.
- Yeah, Mum.

554
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,920
- Awesome. Perfect.
- Come through, James.

555
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,600
- What's happening?
- They're about to start lunch.

556
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,680
- James, move, please.
- Could I have my tray?

557
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,520
Oh goodness, wait for me.

558
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,560
I like her hat.

559
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,920
- Oh, thank you.
- It's okay.

560
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,200
<i>...a lunch at the Guildhall,
hosted by the Lord Mayor of London.</i>

561
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,120
She doesn't like these sort of big events.

562
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,200
- Hm.
- She's actually quite shy.

563
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:37,200
We always say there's a...
a list of what she feels comfortable with.

564
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,240
Um...

565
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,440
Dogs, horses, men, then women.

566
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,800
Oh.

567
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,920
Tough luck, darling. Bottom of the list.

568
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,240
In conversation with her,
stick to the first two subjects,

569
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,520
and you'll always be all right.

570
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,200
Well, that's good to know.

571
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,280
- Am I doing all right?
- Brilliantly.

572
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,680
<i>In all the words written
and spoken about Your Majesty</i>

573
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,560
<i>in celebration of the jubilee,</i>

574
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,560
<i>two themes constantly recur.</i>

575
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:08,800
<i>First, everyone refers to the sheer scope
of the change over the 50 years.</i>

576
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,280
What does she think of him?

577
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,600
President Blair?

578
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,920
- Is that what she calls him?
- That was a joke.

579
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:19,240
- She never discusses her prime ministers.
- Oh, come on.

580
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,600
- Mum.
- No, seriously. Never.

581
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,360
And it's not like we don't ask her.

582
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,680
<i>So, if I could
put it this way, ma'am,</i>

583
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,760
<i>it is not only the quantity of your reign
we are celebrating today.</i>

584
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,720
<i>It is the quality.</i>

585
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:35,800
The only clue we get is the length
of their private audiences every week.

586
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,840
And his never last that long.

587
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,600
Ugh...

588
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,960
- She generally preferred his predecessor.
- Who? John Major?

589
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,720
Well, we preferred his predecessor,
didn't we, darling? Mrs. T.

590
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,560
Oh. Here comes Granny.

591
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,480
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

592
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,160
<i>this golden jubilee is an opportunity</i>

593
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,280
<i>to reflect on the country
and the Commonwealth</i>

594
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:05,040
<i>that it has been my pleasure to serve.</i>

595
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,320
- She's been so nervous about today.
<i>- Fifty years is a long time.</i>

596
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,640
You'd never guess.

597
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,560
No.

598
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,880
- She can be quite inscrutable like that.
- In what way?

599
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:19,440
Princess Margaret and the Queen Mother
always seemed to know

600
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,120
what was going on beneath the surface,
but... they're gone now.

601
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,520
And to the rest of us,
she can be quite an enigma.

602
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,840
But that's the trick, I suppose.

603
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,760
To maintain the mystery.

604
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,920
It's also how she manages
to keep us all on our toes.

605
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,920
<i>...this golden jubilee.</i>

606
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:49,040
<i>While it had not been my destiny at birth
to assume the throne,</i>

607
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,720
fate decreed otherwise.

608
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,280
I was fortunate to have
some remarkable role models to look up to.

609
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,240
My father and mother.

610
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,120
My grandparents, George V and Queen Mary.

611
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,800
<i>They instilled in me</i>

612
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,160
<i>one of my most enduring beliefs.</i>

613
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:17,880
That a life lived in service
is not a sacrifice,

614
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,800
but an honor.

615
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,240
<i>Thank you.</i>

616
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,480
You're naughty. You shouldn't be helping.
It should be James or Pippa!

617
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:40,040
- It's okay.
- Come on, give these to me.

618
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,280
Oh, wow.

619
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,160
Baked it herself.

620
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,840
- Mum!
- It smells amazing.

621
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,200
- Thank you.
- I'll take the plates through.

622
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,680
I put the cream on it
and then the strawberries,

623
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:01,360
but once it's cooled down,
otherwise, it just sort of melts and...

624
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,320
Are you all right?

625
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:10,120
I was just thinking,
after the lunch... she's got the parade.

626
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,800
And after the parade,
she's got the dreaded balcony, and...

627
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,720
Yeah.

628
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,920
I know she gave me a pass
to miss it all, but...

629
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,960
I can't help feeling...

630
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,400
that I should be with her.

631
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,160
It's time.

632
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,040
Are you all right?

633
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,120
I'm fine.

634
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,400
Come.

635
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:48,920
It's William!

636
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:10,680
<i>Well, that was a big hit.</i>

637
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:11,600
Yeah.

638
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:15,600
<i>And the Queen must have been so happy
that you went after all.</i>

639
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:17,360
I think so.

640
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:20,760
Are you okay?

641
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,600
<i>Yeah, it's just...</i>

642
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,360
it makes you realize
the pressures of the job.

643
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:32,800
A change of subject?

644
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:33,960
Please.

645
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,560
<i>So, when are you going back?</i>

646
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,280
Uh, to St. Andrews?

647
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,280
<i>Yeah.</i>

648
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:44,160
Uh... tomorrow. I'm looking at
a couple of houses for next year.

649
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,240
Oh.

650
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,120
Have you decided
who you're going to live with?

651
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:50,120
- <i>Fergus.</i>
- Of course.

652
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,720
- <i>And Olivia.
- </i>  Nice.

653
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,320
There's this place on Hope Street
which looks good.

654
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:57,120
Big windows.

655
00:46:58,680 --> 00:46:59,840
I like Hope Street.

656
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:05,360
But it's got four bedrooms,
and there's just three of us.

657
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:06,480
<i>Ah...</i>

658
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,520
Unless

659
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,680
you happen to know a fourth?

660
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,440
<i>Well, were you thinking a boy or a girl?</i>

661
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:18,560
<i>Probably a girl. To keep things...</i>

662
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,640
<i>Civilized.</i>

663
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:21,720
<i>Exactly.</i>

664
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,040
Looks very nice.

665
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,280
- <i>Would you consider it?</i>
<i>- Is that an invitation?</i>

666
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,560
- <i>I would have to ask the others.</i>
<i>- Of course.</i>

667
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,800
<i>But I'm sure they'll approve.</i>

668
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:09,640
- Evening, sir.
- Will!

669
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:11,880
Thanks, mate.

670
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:14,400
- Everything all right?
- Ah.

671
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,240
This arrived for you.

672
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,360
{\an8}Cheers, guys!

673
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,600
- To Hope Street!
- To Hope Street!
