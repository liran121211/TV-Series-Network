1
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,400
<i>You have
an investiture ceremony at 11:00,</i>

2
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,000
then lunch with
the Commonwealth secretary-general,

3
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,040
so I thought the black shoes and low heel,

4
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,360
which also works well
for the first meeting after breakfast.

5
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,280
Remind me.

6
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,280
The Duke of Edinburgh, Lord Chamberlain,
and the Duke of Norfolk.

7
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,600
Oh, yes. Did we ever discover
what that was about?

8
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,160
They wouldn't say.

9
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,600
That's not normally a good sign.

10
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,840
<i>Good morning.
The time is nine o'clock,</i>

11
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,880
<i>and here are the news headlines for today.</i>

12
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,560
<i>It has been almost two years</i>

13
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,920
<i>since the British
and American forces went to war with Iraq.</i>

14
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,520
<i>The justification for the invasion
at the time,</i>

15
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,160
<i>that Saddam Hussein had amassed</i>

16
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,120
<i>a huge stockpile
of weapons of mass destruction.</i>

17
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,240
<i>Now, with the secretary-general
of the UN openly...</i>

18
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,440
It's ridiculous.

19
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:07,360
<i>...as illegal, the IAEA hasn't been invited
to restart full inspections.</i>

20
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,360
Marry me.

21
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,200
<i>Instead, investigations into WMDs</i>

22
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,840
<i>are now carried out
by the Iraq Survey Group.</i>

23
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,360
<i>The search for...</i>

24
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,120
That's not a proposal. I can't do that
without my mother's permission,

25
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,440
but... I realize, more than anything
in the world, I want you to be my wife.

26
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,640
<i>...chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons</i>

27
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,640
<i>have still not been unearthed.</i>

28
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,600
<i>Many people who supported the war
are now asking...</i>

29
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,840
That's a complete disaster.

30
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,800
<i>...including the prime minister's claim that
Saddam's apparently non-existent weapons</i>

31
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,040
<i>could be deployed within 45 minutes.</i>

32
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,080
So the Scots Guards
will be here. The Coldstream Guards...

33
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,880
Rest on a platform near the High Altar.

34
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,040
Oh...

35
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,240
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning.

36
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,160
Your Majesty.

37
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,200
The purpose of this meeting is,

38
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,000
and it's not because we have
any reason to be fearful--

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,960
Oh, get on with it, David.

40
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:10,120
That we might really step up our planning
of Operation London Bridge.

41
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,320
That's the code name
for your funeral, ma'am.

42
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,040
We know what it is, Edward.

43
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,720
Is that really necessary?
I recently got a clean bill of health,

44
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,240
and in terms of age, I'm only--

45
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,520
- Eighty.
- Yes, all right. Not quite.

46
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,040
A matter of months.

47
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,800
Simply for reasons of prudence
and good order.

48
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,920
Why not start with the Duke of Edinburgh?

49
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,800
He's older than me. And, statistically,
men tend to die earlier.

50
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,520
Well, that's true, and that's why
we've been working on mine for years.

51
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,720
Operation Forth Bridge.

52
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,320
- Oh... Oh, don't say that.
- Why?

53
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,160
It's so sad.

54
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,040
No!

55
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,880
No, I'm finding it all rather stimulating.

56
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,800
You might too.

57
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,160
It's surprising what it all stirs up.
Isn't it, Edward?

58
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,720
Yes. So, with your permission, ma'am,
can we make a start?

59
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,040
As a template, we've used
the funeral of the late King George VI.

60
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,560
We would call on
an estimated 6,000 military personnel

61
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,520
for the procession.

62
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,080
A tri-service parade
embracing each of the armed services,

63
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,320
alongside representatives
from the 15 other Commonwealth realms.

64
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,480
The gun carriage
will be drawn by the Sovereign's Guard.

65
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,240
They will march at the customary rhythm
of 75 paces per minute...

66
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,760
{\an8}Out, out, out!

67
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,600
Out, out, out!

68
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,000
What's going on?

69
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,440
The prime minister's just coming out, sir.

70
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,120
- No! Hey! Hey!
- You war criminal!

71
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,040
You warmonger!

72
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,920
<i>Remember when
he first came to power?</i>

73
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,880
<i>They took to the streets and cheered.</i>

74
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,840
<i>Now they want to impeach him
for high crimes and misdemeanors.</i>

75
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,480
<i>And Tony Blair's become Tony B-liar.</i>

76
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,080
<i>One is reminded once again that
the career of prime ministers is nasty,</i>

77
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,720
brutish, and short.

78
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,600
He has no intention of stepping down.
His ambition is to become

79
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,840
the first Labour prime minister
to win a third successive term.

80
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,360
That's the thing.

81
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,480
Once people get a taste of life
at the top, they never want to leave.

82
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,520
Is that right?

83
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,680
They just want to keep... on and on.

84
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,160
Yes. Anyway, I'm sure this is not why
you've come to see me today.

85
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,120
No.

86
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,880
I've come to make a request
I wish I'd made 30 years ago.

87
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,120
To ask your blessing

88
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,280
to marry Camilla.

89
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,320
You can't say this has come
out of the blue, Mummy.

90
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,400
She and I have been in love now
for 30 years.

91
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,040
And every day of those 30 years,
she has been heroic.

92
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,480
You don't think ending her relationship
with you once you'd married Diana

93
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,840
would have been "heroic"?

94
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,760
She did.

95
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,760
Camilla is blameless in that regard.
She always wanted to keep her marriage.

96
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,040
Then why didn't she?

97
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,800
- Because her husband left.
- And why did he do that?

98
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,360
Because he'd had enough,
as I understand it,

99
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,920
of reading about her adultery with you
in the newspapers.

100
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,040
You and I both know Andrew is no angel.
He was serially unfaithful himself.

101
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,080
So, can we agree?
There's nothing heroic about any of this.

102
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,520
For years and years,
Camilla has suffered judgment and calumny

103
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,760
and never, ever complained. Not once.

104
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,600
<i>That</i> is heroic.

105
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,200
Instead, she's stayed silent.

106
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,400
And loyal, to you and the Crown.

107
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,080
With not a single thank you in return.

108
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,640
- A thank you?
- Yes, thank you.

109
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,560
Not just for her discretion,
but for loving and making happy

110
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,560
the person who's next in line.

111
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,320
That, surely, is in all our interests.

112
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,600
What is he doing?

113
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,000
Planning his funeral.

114
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,600
He wants that as his hearse.

115
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,280
You always said, Mummy,
that you couldn't do the job

116
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,920
without Papa by your side.

117
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,600
That he's your strength and stay.

118
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,160
Camilla is my strength.

119
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,120
And my stay.

120
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,760
I couldn't do it without her.

121
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,440
I will reflect on it,

122
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,960
take advice,

123
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,400
and give you an answer soon.

124
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,200
Thank you.

125
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,160
It will probably be fine.

126
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,000
You all have in front of you a first draft
of the plans for London Bridge.

127
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,760
Oh, for heaven's sake.

128
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,440
Yes, a little heavy at the moment, ma'am,

129
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,880
but it will shrink down nicely
as you begin to express your preferences.

130
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,680
My preference would be
a quiet service in Scotland,

131
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,640
out of sight, and over in 20 minutes.

132
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,400
Perfectly understandable.
But this is the funeral

133
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,640
of what we expect to be
the longest-serving monarch in history.

134
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,200
People will want to celebrate your reign
and mark the end of an era,

135
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,320
not just here, but all around the world.

136
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,760
So, I'd like to start with
the logistical contingencies

137
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,200
depending upon where the, uh,

138
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,920
forgive me, ma'am,
the, uh... death actually occurs.

139
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,120
If it's abroad, ma'am,
or here in the United Kingdom.

140
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,680
I shall do my best to keep it local.

141
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,640
Thank you, ma'am.

142
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:45,560
The first chapter is
if the event occurs on a foreign tour.

143
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,120
Please turn to page ten.

144
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,560
Watch out!

145
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,520
Are you guys going
to Harry Meade's birthday party?

146
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,880
- Definitely.
- When is it?

147
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,320
Next week.

148
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,880
- Bloody hell!
- Should be good. 250 people going.

149
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,160
- Fancy dress.
- I hate fancy dress.

150
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,400
You have to rent a costume,
which stinks of other people's BO.

151
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,560
Fucking royal twats.

152
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,920
Meet my brother, life and soul.

153
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,480
Oh!

154
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,480
What's the theme?

155
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,440
- You pricks!
- Colonials and natives.

156
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,520
Then there's that.

157
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,520
Think they could have picked
a more offensive theme?

158
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,200
You're such an undergraduate now.
You'd have never said that before uni.

159
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,920
- But now I am saying it.
- Cliché.

160
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,400
That's me done.
I'm out. You fucking idiots!

161
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,120
- Come on, love.
- You're shit. You can't fucking shoot me.

162
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,960
Fuck you. Fuck the rich.

163
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,040
- Well, hit him.
- Hold on. Hold on.

164
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,200
- He's going.
- Hold on.

165
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,200
Clip his arse!

166
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,040
That's fucking...

167
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,640
- You cunt!
- Oh my God.

168
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,400
Beautiful.

169
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,840
Your Royal Highnesses!

170
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,800
I've just had a call
from the Queen's private secretary.

171
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,960
- Can you come down?
- It's never good when they come in packs.

172
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,240
Yeah.

173
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,440
Your Majesty.

174
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,280
My Lord Bishops.

175
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,720
I asked you all here today

176
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:40,240
because the Prince of Wales has requested
my permission to marry Mrs. Parker Bowles.

177
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,120
And I think I'd like to grant it.

178
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,360
And, of course,
as head of the Church of England,

179
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,600
that is your right.

180
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,280
But it will not be straightforward.

181
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,880
Or, one suspects, popular?

182
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,880
Why? I was led to believe

183
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,320
the General Synod had eased its stance
on the marriage of divorcees.

184
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,160
Oh, it has,

185
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,920
but... many people
in this country still believe

186
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:19,480
that the relationship between
the Prince of Wales and Mrs. Parker Bowles

187
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,640
was responsible for the breakdown
of a royal marriage.

188
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,040
The Church, I think, needs to be satisfied

189
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,040
that permitting the new marriage

190
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:34,560
would not, in effect,
consecrate a past infidelity.

191
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,520
For the Church of England
to be seen to be blessing it

192
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,960
could risk a split
in the Anglican Communion.

193
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,760
One suggestion could be that,
and I would be interested

194
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,360
in hearing the Archbishop
of Canterbury's view,

195
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:55,040
that the prince and Mrs. Parker Bowles
marry in a civil ceremony

196
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,080
and then have
a church blessing afterwards.

197
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,480
In a registry office?

198
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,800
In the eyes of the Church, no marriage
service is more legitimate than another.

199
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,920
It's more a question of signals.

200
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,560
Appearances.

201
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:15,240
A condition of the blessing
could be some form of atonement.

202
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,040
Quite so. Some acknowledgment

203
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,680
of wrongdoing on the couple's part.

204
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,400
Ma'am.

205
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,800
The service might include
a prayer of penitence,

206
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,680
in which the couple
join with the congregation

207
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,760
in asking forgiveness for past

208
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,280
wickedness.

209
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:45,280
I've always taken comfort in the knowledge
that God retaineth not his anger forever

210
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,520
because he delighteth in mercy.

211
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,600
Whatever short-term risk
the marriage may present

212
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,560
to the integrity of the Church,

213
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,600
one has to imagine it would do less damage

214
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,880
than if I were to die a--

215
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,440
Well, it is going to happen one day.

216
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,800
...and my heir acceded to the throne

217
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,800
while living in sin.

218
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,880
Oi-oi.

219
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,920
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon, sir.

220
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,080
Your Royal Highnesses,
Her Majesty will see you now.

221
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,040
Come on, Harry.

222
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,560
Harry!

223
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,280
Granny.

224
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,680
Thank you both for coming.

225
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,000
Now, I need some air.

226
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,080
Would you be very cross
if I suggest we go for a walk?

227
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,160
I'd like to discuss
your dear papa.

228
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,200
- What's he done now?
- Nothing he's done.

229
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,600
It's what he wants to do.

230
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,520
How would you both feel...
about him getting married?

231
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,520
I knew it.

232
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,680
Why can't they carry on as they are?

233
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,040
'Cause Charles will be king one day,

234
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,960
and the last time we had an unmarried king
on the throne, it did not end well.

235
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,240
- But what's the--
- William.

236
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,520
Obviously, both of us
prefer to think of him with Mummy.

237
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,320
And anything other than that... feels...

238
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,600
Wrong. So wrong.

239
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,200
But, I suppose,
this is the reality.

240
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,600
And she does seem to make him happy.

241
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,480
Does she?

242
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,280
And having him happy
and settled is good for us.

243
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,120
And, ultimately, good for...

244
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,200
Good for...?

245
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,680
Well, as you say,
he is going to be king, isn't he? One day?

246
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,360
Yes.

247
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,320
Plus, then he might
finally shut up about it all.

248
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,400
So,

249
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,240
is that a yes?

250
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,280
Yes.

251
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,040
Thank you.

252
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,960
I didn't want to give my blessing
until you'd given yours.

253
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:36,920
Yes, good.

254
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,520
Yes?

255
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,240
Ah, yes, of course.

256
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,440
- It's the Queen.
- Your Royal Highness.

257
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,040
Yes, put her through, please.

258
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,720
Mummy.

259
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,560
I've spoken to
the Archbishop of Canterbury

260
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,360
and the Bishop of Salisbury.

261
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,800
- I can't believe you caved like that.
- I didn't cave. I'm just being a realist.

262
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,120
And changing your tune,
not saying what you feel.

263
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,440
- That's what being a realist is.
- You're such a fucking company man.

264
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,280
I'm just trying to be an adult.

265
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,320
I don't expect you
to understand what that feels like.

266
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,240
So... congratulations.

267
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,880
Thank you.

268
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,960
Thank you, Mummy.

269
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,160
It's done.

270
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,760
Darling...

271
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,440
How was it with the boys today?

272
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,520
Fine.

273
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,440
- That's a relief.
- They supported the idea of the marriage.

274
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,160
Slightly through gritted teeth.

275
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,160
Harry's more gritted than William's.

276
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,160
Hmm. I'm not surprised.

277
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,720
I worry about Harry.

278
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,520
Ah, well, we all do.

279
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,880
Some time in the army should sort him out.

280
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,120
Everything all right?

281
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,960
I think so.

282
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,280
Though, as you predicted,

283
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,560
all this talk of my funeral
has stirred things up a bit.

284
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,640
Anything you want to discuss?

285
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,000
Not yet.

286
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,640
Well, in that case,

287
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,840
good night.

288
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,080
Good night.

289
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,240
Wait. Wait.

290
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,480
Thank you.

291
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,240
Your Majesty.

292
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,600
- You asked to see me.
- I did.

293
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,440
I hope you know

294
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,800
how much everyone appreciates
your beautiful music every day.

295
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,800
I don't mind telling you, there are days
when I wake up and it all feels a bit...

296
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,440
Then I hear you play,
and all that goes away.

297
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,120
Thank you, ma'am.

298
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,320
They've got me planning my funeral
at the moment.

299
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,680
Just as a precaution.

300
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,920
And I'm in the process
of choosing the music

301
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:39,040
and wondered if there was a tune
for the pipes you thought might work.

302
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,640
Uh...

303
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,120
There are a number of laments

304
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,080
written for fallen soldiers, ma'am.

305
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,200
"I Will Go Home to Kintail"
springs to mind.

306
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,520
"Lord Lovat's Lament."

307
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,920
But is there
a particular one that you like?

308
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,880
What, me, ma'am?

309
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,240
Yes, Pipes. You.

310
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,160
Uh... there is...

311
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,520
there is one

312
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,000
that I particularly like.

313
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,240
It's "Sleep Dearie Sleep."

314
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,680
Will you play it for me?

315
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,920
What, now?

316
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,960
Why not?

317
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,920
Inside?

318
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,960
It's a hell of a din, ma'am.

319
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,440
It's not a din to me.

What about an astronaut?

331
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,200
- Or a cowboy?
- No, he's more of a goodie-goodie.

332
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,480
- Or a dick.
<i>- </i>  I'm going as a lion.

333
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,640
- Oh, the Lion King.
- Oh, arf-arf.

334
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,160
I'm going to go as... What about Biggles?

335
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,600
- What's that got to do with colonialism?
- Will.

336
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,240
Germany had an empire, didn't they?

337
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,640
What about this?

338
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,560
I don't know. Maybe cover the swastika?

339
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,680
Oh, come on. Wearing the outfit
doesn't make him a Nazi.

340
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,840
- Isn't that the joke?
- How about that wedding dress for you?

341
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,000
Come on. Don't pretend
you haven't already thought about it.

342
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,440
- Thanks, Harry. Nice touch.
- Your brother...

343
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,120
- Where's Guy?
- Oh, you've got...

344
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,680
- It's so cute.
- Hello!

345
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,600
The fuck?

346
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,040
Who stole my ganja?

347
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,640
- Oh my God.
- Whoo.

348
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,280

Queenie's here!

352
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,120
Hello! How you doing?

353
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,320
- All right, mate?
- I'm good.

354
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,800
This is incredible!

355
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,800
Granny, what are you doing?

00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,880

357
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,120
I'm being fun!

358
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,840
- They have a band.
- They have a band. They--

What are you doing?

360
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,440
Guy. Guy.

361
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,680
- That's naughty.
- Is he going onto the stage?

362
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,760
Excuse me! I'm sorry.

363
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,080

00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,040
Oh, Harry.

375
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,480
God.

376
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,520

Fuck.

379
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,680
I was a troublemaker at school.

380
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,480
Repeatedly caned by my housemaster.

381
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,120
Six of the best.

382
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,360
We all make mistakes
in the flushes of youth.

383
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,240
Rarely as gross a misjudgment as this.

384
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,960
A swastika armband
two weeks before Holocaust Memorial Day.

385
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,560
There's a great deal of affection
in the country for Harry.

386
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,960
An apology, followed by a...

387
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:47,000
a period of contrition...
should pave the way for forgiveness.

388
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,000
Is that the advice
you'll be giving yourself over Iraq?

389
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:56,480
I think we can agree things are
not working out too well over there.

390
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,720
My hope is that... the democratic elections
scheduled for the end of this month

391
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:07,360
will form the beginnings
of an exit strategy that should allow us

392
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,240
to close this chapter and move on.

393
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,720
Exit strategy.

394
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,040
Ma'am?

395
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,680
That's a subject
that's been coming up a lot recently.

396
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,560
You've got to thread it through.

397
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,560
No, thread--

398
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,640
Yes, all right, thank you.
I think-- I remember now. Thank you.

399
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,440
Must go through...

400
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,720
Thank you.

401
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,840
That's it. That's it.

402
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,840
No, why hasn't it gone through?

403
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,600
It's meant to go under here.

404
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,400
And it hasn't.

405
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,920
That's it. Right about...

406
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,600
Stop that.

407
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,120
No.

408
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,640
Yes!

409
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,040
Oh, bingo.

410
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,880
Oh, good.

411
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,840
Ma'am.

412
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,000
Oh! There you are.

413
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,240
- Yes, here I still am.
- No breakfast?

414
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,320
Wasn't hungry.

415
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,120
Not like you.

416
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,200
How was Harry?

417
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,880
A bit subdued.

418
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:57,440
His father's got him
mucking out pigs as punishment.

419
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,520
That feels a little Old Testament.

420
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,240
<i>I agree.</i>

421
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,480
<i>Harry was foolish to go to that party
dressed in that costume,</i>

422
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,960
<i>but he was bloody unlucky</i>

423
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,680
that a fellow guest
should go to the newspapers like that.

424
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,720
Yes.

425
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:17,440
So I phoned the costume rental shop,
gave them a piece of my mind.

426
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,800
Why?

427
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,880
<i>What will it take
to get you to understand, hmm?</i>

428
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,920
Should I draw it in sodding crayon?

429
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,200
The uniform was inaccurate.

430
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,200
The German Afrika Korps
never wore swastikas.

431
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,040
A fact I impressed upon
the Sandhurst top brass,

432
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,040
who happily agree this latest episode

433
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,240
should not prevent Harry
entering officer training.

434
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,240
Oh, well done.

435
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,920
- To ban him would be madness.
- Mmm.

436
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,160
And would only exacerbate
the real problem.

437
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,440
Which is?

438
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,560
A lack of a sense of purpose,

439
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,760
due to a failure of responsible parenting.

440
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,320
Yes.

441
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,520
Do you want to discuss anything
before I go?

442
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,560
About what?

443
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:15,080
Well, the funeral.
What it might have stirred up for you.

444
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,000
No.

445
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,920
Thank you.

446
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,440
Right, well, I'll be off.

447
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,400
Duty calls.

448
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,040
You coward. Why didn't you tell him?

449
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,920
What you've been thinking since
you first started working on your funeral.

450
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,000
In fact, since the golden jubilee.

451
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,880
How tired... no, not just tired,

452
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,200
exhausted you are by it all.

453
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,920
Yes.

454
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,280
How ready for a rest.

455
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,720
And, at the same time,
how ready he suddenly looks.

456
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:10,880
Who?

457
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,640
Charles.

458
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,880
Oh, him.

459
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,600
Yes.

460
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:32,640
You even have precedent. Queen Wilhelmina
of the Netherlands was 68

461
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,840
when she stepped down
in favor of her daughter.

462
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,080
Charlotte of Luxembourg
was also in her late sixties.

463
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:40,840
That's the Netherlands and Luxembourg.
Bicycle monarchies. Not the same thing.

464
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:44,160
It's exactly the same thing.
And, in both cases, a great success.

465
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,920
You've been on the throne
for over half a century.

466
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,400
- Longer than any queen.
- Apart from Queen Victoria.

467
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,520
How effective was she by the end?

468
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,480
Rheumatic and blind, weak and unwell.
Hidden away on the Isle of Wight.

469
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,160
You're almost 80 years old.

470
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,720
So everyone keeps reminding me.

471
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,560
That's nearly 20 years
past the retirement age for women.

472
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,360
- No need to go on.
- That's what I'm saying.

473
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,240
No need to go on.

474
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,680
Your first loyalty's
always been to the Crown.

475
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,320
Sometimes at the expense
of being a mother.

476
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:25,120
Stepping down... is the right thing to do.

477
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,760
As Queen and as a mother.

478
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,240
Your Majesty.

479
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,240
Everyone has now agreed on a date
for the wedding.

480
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,120
Ninth of April.
At the Guildhall in Windsor.

481
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:18,840
Oh, we also felt, given your role
as head of the Church of England

482
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:22,280
and the Church's position
that marriage is a lifelong commitment,

483
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:26,480
that it would be wrong
for you to attend the ceremony in person.

484
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,680
Mmm.

485
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,400
The idea being
you can watch the coverage on television

486
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,000
and, uh... and then join everyone
for the service at St. George's Chapel.

487
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,680
And the reception at Windsor Castle.

488
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,840
Has the prime minister
been invited to the reception?

489
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,280
Yes, ma'am.

490
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,960
- And the leader of the opposition?
- Yes.

491
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,000
And the Archbishop of Canterbury?

492
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,520
Yes.

493
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:53,640
And there will be an opportunity
for me to say a few words?

494
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:59,720
Oh, I'm sure everyone would be delighted.
Would you like me to draft something?

495
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,880
That won't be necessary.
I'll write something myself.

496
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,480
That's all. Thank you, Robin.

497
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,400
You were all for the uniform
in the costume shop. Egging me on.

498
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,640
- Suddenly you're Mr. Morality.
- Oh, right.

499
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,960
Stabbing me in the back.

500
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,240
How many faces does this man have?

501
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,200
Not sure I like who you're turning into.

502
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,720
- Not sure I like who you've been.
- Can you stop bickering? I beg you.

503
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,360
<i>How was supper?</i>

504
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,920
Well, I'm sad to say
it was all rather unpleasant.

505
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,880
- The boys were snapping at each other.
<i>- Well, that's just boys.</i>

506
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,760
Can I make one request?

507
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,680
That you don't make
my wedding day a misery.

508
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,280
I've waited too long for it.

509
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:58,560
<i>Yes, but you didn't witness it.
It was horrid how they were to each other.</i>

510
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,080
Vicious and unkind.

511
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,200
<i>They're young.
Riding the waves of emotion.</i>

512
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,480
<i>Understandable after
what they've been through.</i>

513
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:11,440
<i>Are they going to blame me,
do you think, and hold me responsible</i>

514
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,320
<i>for the way they've turned out?</i>

515
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:16,120
Well, being their father,
you <i>are</i> responsible.

516
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,280
For making it better.

517
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,680
<i>As soon as they're through tomorrow,
everything will be fine.</i>

518
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,280
Well, I do hope so.

519
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,160
<i>And how are you?</i>

520
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,080
Me?

521
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,240
I'm all right.

522
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:36,280
My sister persuaded me to get a fake tan,
so now I smell like the dog's blanket.

523
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,160
Are you having any last-minute doubts?

524
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,680
Not me.

525
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,120
I'm in.

526
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:51,880
For all of it?

527
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,680
For whatever being married to you
turns out to be.

528
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:01,440
Well, you might find out
what that entails sooner than you imagine.

529
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,040
<i>What's that supposed to mean?</i>

530
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,880
Well, I've been told
that the Queen intends to make a speech

531
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,360
at the reception afterwards.

532
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:12,040
<i>A speech which nobody's seen</i>

533
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:15,880
and which she's, um... written herself.

534
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:20,760
<i>It feels like
she's planning a big announcement.</i>

535
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,680
<i>My father met with Anne
to ask what she thought was in it,</i>

536
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,160
<i>but she's as baffled as the rest of us.</i>

537
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,400
<i>Then Anne rang Andrew,
and he went riding with the Queen,</i>

538
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,080
<i>but, well, you know Andrew.</i>

539
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,480
<i>Drew a complete blank.</i>

540
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,440
So if her intention was
to set tongues wagging,

541
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,120
she's certainly succeeded.

542
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:46,040
Don't give it any further thought.

543
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:47,680
<i>Yes.</i>

544
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,040
Just think about the boys.

545
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,240
Thank you, darling.

546
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:13,640
Here.

547
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,240
Dinner was weird.

548
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:21,960
Yeah.

549
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,720
When he overcompensates like that...

550
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,720
"This can be
an exciting new chapter for us all."

551
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,800
Barf.

552
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,680
A few years ago,
it would have pissed me off.

553
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:38,920
Now I just don't care.

554
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:47,280
I heard Granny's going to
make a speech at the wedding.

555
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,840
Would you like to know what else I heard?

556
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,040
That she's going to use the occasion
to tell the family she's standing down.

557
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,600
- After 50 years in the job.
- She'd never do that.

558
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,520
And even if she did, why on Pa's big day?

559
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,960
Because it's the wedding present
he most wants?

560
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,200
- He does want it, doesn't he?
- Craves it.

561
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,880
For him and for Camilla.

562
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:20,000
If she did, know what else it would mean?

563
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:22,960
It would be you next.

564
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,680
That'd make you William the...

565
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:26,600
Fifth.

566
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:28,400
Better than Second.

567
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,560
- He was assassinated by his brother.
- Was he?

568
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,840
Who, would you believe,
was also called Prince Harry.

569
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,720
He had William killed
in a shooting "accident,"

570
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:42,080
then galloped off to Winchester
to claim the throne for himself.

571
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,880
Don't worry, mate.
I wouldn't do that to you.

572
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,240
- Really?
- Yeah.

573
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,800
Good spot for it.

574
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:39,760
And a white one.

575
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,520
For the boys.

576
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:32,320
Hello.

577
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,200
Yeah.

578
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:35,760
Bye.

579
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:39,280
Hello.

580
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:44,480
<i>The cheers from the crowds
lining the streets of Windsor</i>

581
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,320
<i>can be heard for miles around</i>

582
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:49,040
<i>as Prince Charles
and Camilla Parker Bowles</i>

583
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:52,840
<i>pass through them on the way
to their civil marriage ceremony.</i>

584
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:55,360
<i>Wonderful scenes here
as the royal couple smiles</i>

585
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,520
<i>and waves to the hundreds of well-wishers</i>

586
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:00,720
<i>who have been waiting since dawn
to get the best view</i>

587
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,080
<i>of the happy couple.</i>

588
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,840
<i>And they've just arrived at the Guildhall,</i>

589
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:08,080
<i>stepping out of
the Queen's own Rolls-Royce Phantom VI,</i>

590
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:12,040
<i>which was originally
presented to Her Majesty in 1978.</i>

591
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:14,440
I don't know what you think you're doing.

592
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,040
I'm doing the sensible thing.

593
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,400
The responsible thing.

594
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:24,000
If we're not careful,
if I go on another 20, 25 years,

595
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,560
a tired, white-haired geriatric queen

596
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:30,320
will hand over to a tired,
white-haired geriatric Prince of Wales.

597
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,360
Those are the rules.

598
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,560
But if he were then to go on
another 20, 25 years,

599
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,880
it would mean
that for the next half century,

600
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,120
the British monarchy would be
a very decrepit experience indeed.

601
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,000
Is that the right thing
to do to the institution?

602
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,880
Charles is in the prime of his life now.

603
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,720
Honestly, I've never heard
so much nonsense.

604
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,760
Have you forgotten the oath that you took?
I declare...

605
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,760
...before you all that my whole life,

606
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,760
whether it be long or short,
shall be devoted to your service.

607
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:03,280
You're fit enough to ride and drive.
You're fit enough to wear the crown.

608
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,280
You remember what Queen Mary told you.

609
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:10,360
Another geriatric.

610
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:15,080
Monarchy is something you are,
not what you do.

611
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,200
The Crown is a symbol of permanence.

612
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,440
Of stability. Of continuity.

613
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:24,160
If you step down, you will be symbolizing
instability and impermanence.

614
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:28,480
You'll also be indicating
the luxury of choice,

615
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,440
which is the one thing we cannot have

616
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,840
if we claim the Crown is
also our birthright.

617
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:36,120
So you would have
a superannuated old lady running the show

618
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:38,920
while a fit,
energetic Prince of Wales watches on,

619
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,720
straining at the leash.

620
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:43,200
But I don't see you as decrepit.

621
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:46,920
Since the jubilee, since Mummy's death,
I see you as liberated.

622
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:49,520
Confident.

623
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:52,520
You say that Charles is in his prime.

624
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:55,960
Well, I see you in yours.

625
00:49:59,000 --> 00:49:59,960
And admit it.

626
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:06,400
You sometimes think there's a difference
between you and the rest of the family.

627
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:10,280
Yes.

628
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,400
It comes naturally to you.

629
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,080
They all seem to make such a mess of it.

630
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,040
I didn't say that.

631
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,640
No, but you've thought it.

632
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:25,600
Privately.

633
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:28,760
And with good reason.

634
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:34,600
This system is
a dreadful thing to inflict upon people.

635
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:37,120
It's not natural.

636
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,040
It's not fair.

637
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,200
It's not kind.

638
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,840
But you seem to thrive in it.

639
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:50,400
And, more importantly,
it seems to thrive under you.

640
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:56,440
So, shouldn't you stay
for every single day that you can?

641
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,640
But what about the life I put aside?

642
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:09,200
The woman I put aside

643
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,040
when I became Queen.

644
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,240
What sort of question is that?

645
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:20,520
For years now,

646
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:22,920
there has been just one Elizabeth.

647
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:26,160
Queen Elizabeth.

648
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,680
If you went looking for Elizabeth Windsor,

649
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,160
you wouldn't find her.

650
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:38,360
She's gone.

651
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:41,520
Long gone.

652
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,760
You buried her years ago.

653
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:07,000
<i>And here they are,
His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales</i>

654
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,200
<i>and Her Royal Highness
the Duchess of Cornwall</i>

655
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,680
<i>facing the public
for the first time as man and wife.</i>

656
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:16,440
<i>No fairy-tale kiss
from the happy couple for the onlookers.</i>

657
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:19,120
<i>Instead, smiles and a brief wave.</i>

658
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:26,840
Ready?

659
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:29,040
Yes, I think so.

660
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:32,240
This, um...

661
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,280
This speech you're about to make.

662
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,480
Yes?

663
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:40,280
Everyone's got their knickers in a twist
about it.

664
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:44,680
- Have they?
<i>- </i> You sure you don't want to discuss it?

665
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:46,160
Quite sure. Thank you.

666
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:50,960
Come on.

667
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:56,480
<i>♪ Praise, my soul ♪</i>

668
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:01,160
<i>♪ The King of Heaven ♪</i>

669
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:08,080
<i>♪ To his feet, thy tribute bring ♪</i>

670
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:13,960
<i>♪ Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven... ♪</i>

671
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,440
<i>Almighty God,</i>

672
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:18,720
<i>father of our Lord, Jesus Christ,</i>

673
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,520
<i>maker of all things,</i>

674
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,280
<i>judge of all men.</i>

675
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:27,960
We acknowledge and bewail
our manifold sins and wickedness,

676
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:31,760
which we from time to time
most grievously have committed

677
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:36,360
by thought, word, and deed
against thy divine majesty,

678
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:41,760
provoking most justly thy wrath
and indignation against us.

679
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,360
We do earnestly repent

680
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:48,040
and are heartily sorry
for these, our misdoings.

681
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:51,760
The remembrance of them is
grievous unto us.

682
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,400
The burden of them is intolerable.

683
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:59,600
Have mercy upon us,
have mercy upon us, most merciful Father.

684
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:02,080
Forgive us all that is past.

685
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:07,880
Grant that we may ever hereafter
serve and please thee in newness of life.

686
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:11,160
In the honor and glory of thy name.

687
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,760
- Amen.
- Amen.

688
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,960
Sorry. Excuse me. Beg your pardon.
Thank you very much.

689
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:54,400
Ready for you, ma'am.

690
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,480
Thank you.

691
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,480
Pray silence for Her Majesty the Queen.

692
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:25,240
Thank you.

693
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:33,600
I suppose one has to start these things
with an introduction.

694
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:37,960
For those of you who don't know me,
I am the mother of the groom.

695
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:46,880
Today has been a memorable day,

696
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:51,200
with a single happy event
bringing the whole nation together.

697
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:55,840
The Grand National steeplechase
finished 20 minutes ago,

698
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:59,440
and the results were as follows.
Hedgehunter, the 7-1 favorite,

699
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:02,880
ridden by Ruby Walsh,
trained by Willie Mullins,

700
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,200
won the race by 14 lengths.

701
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:08,560
Royal Eclair finished second,
Simply Gifted third.

702
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:11,800
In other news,

703
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:15,520
there is a small family wedding
in the Windsor area...

704
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,440
...which the police are
keeping their eyes on.

705
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,720
Chief Constable Darren Dedds said
he was hoping

706
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:27,000
that displays of excessive exuberance
would be kept to a minimum.

707
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,800
Is she looking at you? She is.

708
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,400
She means the boys.

709
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:34,400
Almost 650 years ago,

710
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:39,680
the chapel at Windsor played host
to the wedding of another Prince of Wales,

711
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,280
Edward, the Black Prince.

712
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:46,880
The young Edward was widely expected
to marry a European princess,

713
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,520
but Edward had other ideas.

714
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:52,320
He set his heart on a woman
he had known his whole life,

715
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,520
slightly his senior,

716
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:58,200
a mother who had previously been married.

717
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:05,000
What ensued was a devoted, loving marriage

718
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,200
that would last their whole lives.

719
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,280
Hear, hear.

720
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:11,440
Charles,

721
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,960
I know that over the years,
it hasn't been easy.

722
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,680
Being Prince of Wales is hardly
a recipe for happiness.

723
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,360
History has taught us that.

724
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:24,640
To be condemned to watch an old parent

725
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:29,720
do a job one can imagine oneself
doing better, for years and years...

726
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:36,800
It is to your great credit
that you have filled this vacuum

727
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:39,560
not, like several predecessors,

728
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:42,520
with idleness and excess,

729
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:47,320
but with a great swell of activity
and charitable endeavor.

730
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:49,760
Hear, hear.

731
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,040
- Harry. She skipped it.
- Skipped it?

732
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:59,200
And now,

733
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:02,000
a word of thanks to Camilla.

734
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:06,600
It can't have been easy for you either
over the years.

735
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:12,560
But your good cheer and warm humanity
work wonderfully in your favor...

736
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:14,160
Hear, hear.

737
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:18,640
...both as a strength and stay
for the Prince of Wales...

738
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:24,240
and as an addition to this family.

739
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,200
Thank you

740
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:29,920
for your patience and forbearance.

741
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:35,760
So, now will you all raise your glasses
to the young couple?

742
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:39,760
Charles and Camilla.

743
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:42,000
Charles and Camilla.

744
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,160
I'm gonna get you!

745
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:59,360
Girls! Oi!

746
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:02,840
This way!

747
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:06,200
No, can't get me!

748
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:09,600
Nice speech, Granny.

749
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:13,320
- Thank you.
- Though surprisingly short.

750
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:16,000
Sure you didn't forget half of it?

751
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:19,520
I don't know what you're talking about.

752
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:22,920
What do you think?

753
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:24,080
I've got you!

754
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:25,000
Lovely.

755
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,800
It's better than the beer cans
Harold wanted to tie to the bumper.

756
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,160
Be kind to him.

757
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:37,160
In many ways, it's harder
being number two than number one.

758
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:40,280
The system protects number one.

759
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:43,080
Number two tends to...

760
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,160
Go mad?

761
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:48,800
I was going to say,
"need extra care and attention."

762
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:50,920
- Got you!
- Harry, put me down!

763
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,640
- Ma'am.
- Ah.

764
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:53,760
Photographs.

765
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,080
Very good. Let's go inside, come on.

766
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:03,160
Very good.

767
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:08,920
- Come on.
- Your Royal Highnesses.

768
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:10,520
Your future Majesty.

769
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:13,440
Thank you.

770
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,960
Your Royal Highnesses,
thank you very much.

771
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:18,280
Ladies and gentlemen! <i>Tutti</i>!

772
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:19,400
Come on.

773
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:24,080
Girls, if you're gonna have them,
keep them down,

774
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:26,560
and shush. Be quiet.

775
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,240
Charles. Charles.

776
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:40,280
Where's Harry?

777
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:41,800
Harry!

778
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,640
- There's the Queen.
- Ready for you, Your Majesty.

779
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:47,920
Right. For goodness' sake!
Get out of the way!

780
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:50,520
This way, please, everyone!

781
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:53,000
Our revels now are ended.

782
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,200
These, our actors, as I foretold you,

783
01:00:56,200 --> 01:01:00,040
were all spirits and melted into air.

784
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:03,200
For God's sake,
take the bloody photograph, will you?

785
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,400
Here we go.

786
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:06,600
Good God.

787
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,840
All's well that ends well.

788
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,680
Still, it defines the Crown.

789
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:13,840
Oh Jesus Christ.

790
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:15,720
What e'er the course,

791
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:17,960
the end is the renown.

792
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,640
There you go.
That's it. All right.

793
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:22,640
There we go.

794
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:33,480
This way, please!
This way, everyone, please! Thank you!

795
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:36,280
Thank you. Well, that was a surprise.

796
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:38,120
Where did they get those?

797
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,160
Ah!

798
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:15,120
There you are.

799
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:16,120
Yes.

800
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:19,200
Here I still am.

801
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:25,960
Good day, I think.

802
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:27,280
Oh yes.

803
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:30,280
I had the winner
on three of the four races at Aintree.

804
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:32,120
How are you planning on celebrating?

805
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:33,880
Ooh, night on the town?

806
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:36,800
Joyriding? Ram-raiding?

807
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:40,000
Give Chief Constable Dedds
something to worry about after all.

808
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:42,240
Well done with the speech.

809
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:43,880
- Thank you.
- It was funny.

810
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:46,280
Don't sound so surprised.

811
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:49,840
And not a hint of the torment
you've been going through.

812
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:51,960
Was it that obvious?

813
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:52,880
Yes.

814
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:56,240
But the right decision has been made.

815
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:02,080
You will continue as Queen for as long as
you possibly can, for one reason.

816
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:04,480
- Because those are the rules.
- No.

817
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:09,400
Because those that come after you
are not remotely ready to take over.

818
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:13,400
No, but I wasn't either.
Remember? I was so young.

819
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:16,320
Ah, no, no. You were always ready.

820
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:18,320
You were born ready.

821
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:21,280
You are one of a kind.

822
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:25,080
By contrast, this lot...

823
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:27,720
Mmm?

824
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:31,640
The good thing is, it's not our problem.

825
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:35,880
This is where we will be, you and I.

826
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:38,120
Right under this stone.

827
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,160
We'll never hear the screams
from inside there.

828
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,080
Philip.

829
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:46,440
What?

830
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:48,240
You know I'm right.

831
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:53,600
The system makes no sense anymore
to those outside it,

832
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:55,600
nor to those of us <i>inside</i> it.

833
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:02,680
<i>All human things are subject to decay</i>

834
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:05,040
<i>And when fate summons</i>

835
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:07,920
<i>Even monarchs must obey</i>

836
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:14,280
We're a dying breed, you and I.

837
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:20,480
Oh, I'm sure everyone will carry on,
pretending all is well.

838
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,280
But the party's over.

839
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:28,360
The good news is,

840
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:32,800
that while Rome burns
and the temple falls,

841
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:37,600
we will sleep, dearie, sleep.

842
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:39,640
Oh!

843
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:41,000
You looked.

844
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,320
Yes.

845
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:45,400
A piper's lament.

846
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,720
Your sole musical choice.

847
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:52,200
It's very you.

848
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:57,480
And your coffin being driven
in an old Land Rover is very you.

849
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:58,720
Oh!

850
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:00,680
- You looked.
- I did.

851
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:04,600
Well...

852
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,240
I'll leave you to it.

853
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:13,760
Say one for me?
