00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,480
Hi, baba.

2
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,720
How is our special guest?

3
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,200
She seems happy. Sunbathing on deck.

4
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,160
Good.

5
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,640
Now you just have to close her.

6
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,200
And put a ring on her finger.

7
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,200
Give me a chance. It's still early days.

8
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,360
Then let me spell out what is at stake.

9
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,440
If you were to marry this girl,

10
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,200
overnight you would become a giant.
A colossus.

11
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,520
You will have money and power
beyond your wildest dreams.

12
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,320
And you would finally be my equal.

13
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,680
Your equal?

14
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,760
Really?

15
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,000
How?

16
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,480
Because I would make you my partner.
In everything.

17
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,560
The whole company.

18
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,720
You've never offered that before.

19
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,520
You never deserved it before!

20
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,200
Marrying her would eclipse
everything I have ever achieved.

21
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,480
The Ritz in Paris. Harrods. Everything.

22
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,480
And don't all sons
want to eclipse their fathers?

23
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,840
This is your chance. Don't waste it.

24
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,840
Going home? Already? Why?!

25
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,200
What happened?

26
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,360
She needs to work.

27
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,640
Is everything okay?

28
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,240
Everything is MORE than okay.
I took her shopping.

29
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,560
She picked a ring.

30
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,160
What kind of ring?

31
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,400
A gold star.

32
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,200
Covered in diamonds.

33
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,760
From a collection called Dis-Moi Oui.

34
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,440
Oh my God!

35
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,760
He shoots, he scores!!

36
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,480
-It's an engagement ring!
-I don't know.

37
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,440
Of course it's an engagement ring!
Dis-Moi Oui, it means, "Say yes to me."

38
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,200
My son!! You're a closer!!

39
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,520
You're a Fayed!!

40
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,920
Is she wearing it now?

41
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,200
I need a picture.

42
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,800
I haven't got it yet.

43
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,000
I rang the store after we left.

44
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,080
They have it in their Paris branch.

45
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,320
Then take her to Paris.

46
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,840
I would, but she wants to go home.

47
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,560
No.

48
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,040
Take her to Paris
and put the ring on her finger.

49
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,960
This is the greatest day of my life!!

50
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,040
I knew you would do it.

51
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,640
My son!!

52
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,920
My Fayed son!!

53
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,200
Bye.

54
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,200
Bye.

55
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,720
Straight to my apartment.

56
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,600
I have strict orders from Mr. Mohamed.

57
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,560
First to Villa Windsor
and then to the apartment.

58
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,880
The Princess has a set time
for a phone call with her sons.

59
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,320
Straight to my apartment.

60
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,680
Mr. Mohamed's specific instruction
was to take you to Villa Windsor.

61
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,200
Hi, baba.

62
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,000
This wasn't a good idea.

63
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,480
Relax. Give her to me.

64
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,400
It's not the right time. Trust me.
The deviation has irritated her.

65
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,720
Give her to me!

66
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,760
Please stop interfering.

67
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,000
It was all going fine.

68
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,600
I'm just trying to help.

69
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,160
Well, you're not helping.
She's stressed now.

70
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,720
Then go and calm her down.

71
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,480
Please, just leave this with me.

72
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:19,360
I know how important this is to you.
But I know what I'm doing.

73
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,560
Okay, smarty-pants. Bye.

74
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,760
Bye.

75
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,320
Can't we lose them?

76
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,680
Come on. Speed up.

77
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,880
-This is such a mess.
-I know, but I can't do anything about it.

78
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,680
Yes, but you have to try something!

79
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,440
Roses on the table.

80
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,240
-Roses. Understood.
-Lots of roses. This is very important.

81
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,000
Consider it done.

82
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,040
Would you like to see the ring?

83
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,760
-There.
-Ah yes. It is beautiful.

84
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,640
Not bad.

85
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,760
Come on. Let's go.

86
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,800
Make a right.

87
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,520
-Go, go, go! Turn right!
-You can't turn here, sir.

88
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,800
Philippe, change of plan.

89
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,960
Take us to the Ritz.

90
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,000
So,

91
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,240
have you done it?

92
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,720
Have you asked her?

93
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,560
Have you made my dreams come true?

94
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,200
You do?

95
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Tell me.

96
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,000
Are you there?

97
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,280
Are you smoking that or…?

98
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:14,440
No, I'm looking after it.

99
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,400
Okay.

100
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:18,080
-Cigars are in fashion.
-Do you want it?

101
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,880
No, I quit.

102
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,720
-You'd enjoy it though.
-Yes.

103
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:24,280
Next week maybe.

104
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,440
Henri, plans have changed.

105
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,200
Mr. Dodi needs you to drive.

106
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:31,840
Right away.

107
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:42,440
Put it on my tab.

108
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,080
In ten minutes.

109
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,280
They'll be out in ten minutes.

110
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,840
-Everything okay, Henri?
-Yes.

111
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:37,600
Are Philippe and Jean-François
out doing what I asked?

112
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,760
Yes, they're out front
doing the diversion.

113
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,760
No one will see us leave.

114
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:44,840
Trust me.

115
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,240
Good.

116
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,760
Don't try following us.
You'll never catch us.

117
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,760
Piss off.

118
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,440
-Ready. Let's go.
-Yes. Okay.

119
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,760
Come on. Let's go. Let's get out of here.
