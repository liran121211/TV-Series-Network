1
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,040
<i>And so,
Coronation Day is upon us</i>

2
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,440
<i>for the first time since 1953.</i>

3
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,800
<i>A three-day people's festival
has been declared</i>

4
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,360
<i>with concerts and street parties
up and down the country.</i>

5
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,440
<i>The former queen is
understood to be devastated</i>

6
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,760
<i>and is unlikely to attend the service.</i>

7
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,240
O God, The Crown and the Faithful.

8
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,800
<i>Many had been unable
to imagine life without Elizabeth II,</i>

9
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,000
<i>but after almost 50 years on the throne,</i>

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
<i>it's out with Queen Elizabeth</i>

11
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,960
<i>and in with King Tony.</i>

12
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,400
<i>New Britain has a new royal family.</i>

13
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,480
<i>The Labour Party.</i>

14
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,440
God save the King!

15
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:22,040
God save the King! God save the King!

16
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:27,000

Thank you.

40
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,920
<i>I'd like to talk briefly
about the prime minister, if I may.</i>

41
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,920
Ma'am.

42
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,880
Historically, I've not worried too much
about prime ministers' popularity.

43
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,040
It tends to come and go very quickly.

44
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,600
But I've a feeling
that could be different with Mr. Blair.

45
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:25,080
People really do seem to love him
and see him as a true son of England<i>,</i>

46
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,520
and a unifying national symbol
in a way they used to see,

47
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,240
well, me.

48
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,600
And with Mr. Blair scoring higher than me

49
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,800
in every survey one can find,

50
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,720
perhaps... now is the time.

51
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,760
Ma'am?

52
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,880
To find out what seems to have gone wrong
and how we could...

53
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,240
<i>I</i> could do better.

54
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,320
I understand the impulse,

55
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,280
but I'm not sure it's a good idea.

56
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,040
The Crown doesn't ask
existential questions of itself.

57
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,840
- Perhaps it should.
- It suggests a loss of confidence.

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,040
- It's putting blood in the water.
- It's just information, Robert.

59
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,440
I agree.

60
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,680
And I think, finally,
I'm ready to hear it.

61
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,840
Thanks. Name?

62
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,560
- Name?
- Simpson.

63
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,000
Upstairs, third floor.

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,480
Hi, folks, in you come.

65
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,800
If you'd like to find a seat.
Anywhere you like.

66
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,400
Take a seat, quick as you can.
Loos are on the right.

67
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,360
The focus groups you asked for,
ma'am, have now been conducted

68
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,800
<i>in Edinburgh, Leeds, London,</i>

69
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,240
<i>Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff,</i>

70
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,480
<i>Manchester, and Liverpool.</i>

71
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,480
The British royal family.

72
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,360
Professional layabouts.

73
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,040
<i>More than 2,000 subjects
over the age of 18</i>

74
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,840
<i>were asked a series
of yes or no questions about the monarchy.</i>

75
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:04,240
I consider the royal family to be
an important part of British society.

76
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,000
- I'd go along with that.
- You're being disrespectful.

77
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,040
<i>Followed by some,
at times, spirited debates.</i>

78
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,640
Let's keep it civil, please.

79
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,280
<i>Having reviewed the data,</i>

80
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,000
the pollsters have now
presented their findings.

81
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,400
Asked if the royal family were
out of touch with ordinary people,

82
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,720
69% said yes.

83
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,080
Badly advised,

84
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,640
62% said yes.

85
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,080
Asked if they were wasteful
of public money, 54% said yes.

86
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,880
Asked if they lacked compassion,

87
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,360
53% said yes.

88
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,560
Asked if they had failed
the Princess of Wales

89
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,840
as badly in death as in life,

90
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,360
a sobering 66% said yes.

91
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,120
Asked if Britain should have
a smaller, more informal monarchy

92
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,440
like the Netherlands or Scandinavia,

93
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,400
54% said yes.

94
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,160
And when asked if the monarchy
should continue in its present form,

95
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,480
the proportion that agreed was just 10%.

96
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,600
I'd like to propose my own survey.

97
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,240
How many of us think that polls
are a daft idea in the first place?

98
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,480
I don't see why
we should have to listen to these people.

99
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,000
Because we might
actually learn something.

100
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,520
The sample, as I understand it,

101
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,160
is selected to represent
society as a whole, isn't it?

102
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,320
It's still a folly to subject something
as enduring as the monarchy

103
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,200
to the whims of marketing men.

104
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,360
I do think it's significant
that our low numbers come at the same time

105
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,320
that we have a prime minister
of conspicuous popularity.

106
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,240
Yes.

107
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,040
Only Winston at his height
had this kind of support.

108
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,680
Have you learnt nothing
in the time you've been on the throne?

109
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,560
Prime ministers come in
on a blaze of popularity and goodwill--

110
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,920
And leave on a stretcher
a few years later with their reputations,

111
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,080
and usually their health, in tatters.

112
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,600
Yes, that's it, exactly.

113
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,160
Well, I think this one might be different.

114
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,080
Okay.

115
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,480
There he is.

116
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,520
Good evening.

117
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,560
<i>We hoped never to see war</i>

118
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,680
<i>in Central Eastern Europe again
in our lifetimes.</i>

119
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,440
<i>Sadly, it has come,</i>

120
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,920
<i>and it has consequences
for the whole world.</i>

121
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,480
Tonight,

122
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,640
NATO allies launched an offensive
against Serb military targets.

123
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,120
Slobodan Milosevic is
a monstrous dictator,

124
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,800
carrying out the systematic
and violent persecution

125
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,160
of innocent civilians.

126
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,760
He has to be stopped.

127
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,800
We have a moral duty
to ensure he does not succeed.

128
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,640
<i>To all of us in free countries</i>

129
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,200
who think this is a remote conflict

130
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,280
<i>and someone else's problem, I say this.</i>

131
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:40,240
If you value your freedom,
you cannot remain neutral.

132
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,480
<i>This is your war too.</i>

133
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,040
It's encouraging that our NATO partners
have come together against the Serbs

134
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,120
but, well, moral purpose is one thing.

135
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,880
Military success is... quite another.

136
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,440
Every bombing target
has to be approved by committee,

137
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,520
which makes decisions agonizingly slow.

138
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,280
We thought this aerial campaign
would be over in days. Instead, two weeks,

139
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,880
and little or no progress has been made.

140
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,840
The... the Serbs are laughing at us.

141
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,280
I read that the problem was cloud cover.

142
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,640
American stealth bombers need
good conditions to see their targets.

143
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,960
The most sophisticated weaponry
in the world,

144
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,720
and it can't handle the weather?

145
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,120
Which is why
we ultimately need ground troops.

146
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,280
I proposed to President Clinton
a limited invasion of 80,000 troops,

147
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,480
which would drive Serb forces
out of Kosovo

148
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,840
and create safe havens
for refugees to return,

149
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,520
but... he said most Americans
can't point to Yugoslavia on a map,

150
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,920
so why put US servicemen's lives at risk?

151
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,600
- Yes.
- It's most frustrating.

152
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,320
But I won't give up. Morally,

153
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,520
this is the right thing.

154
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,760
<i>Mr. Blair was
unusually resolute today.</i>

155
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,360
In my experience,

156
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:09,160
prime ministers tend to be
either domestic or foreign policy focused.

157
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:14,320
At this early stage, I'd say Mr. Blair
falls very firmly into the latter camp.

158
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,440
Yes.

159
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,880
Statesman syndrome.

160
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,280
Which am I, do you think?

161
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,760
A domestic or foreign policy queen?

162
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,280
Good question, ma'am.

163
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,320
And it's not immediately obvious.

164
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,120
The Commonwealth of Nations is
such an article of faith to you.

165
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,360
- One'd be inclined to say foreign.
- For you, sir.

166
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,280
Thank you.

167
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,800
Who else off the top of their heads

168
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,600
would be able to reel off
the name of the president of... Malawi?

169
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,000
Bakili Muluzi.

170
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,280
And the next member state
to have general elections?

171
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,680
Fiji. Their first since readmission.

172
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,640
Despite all that, it's your interest
in every part of the British Isles

173
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,200
that, I think, ultimately makes you
a domestic queen.

174
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,000
Take today's engagement
at the Women's Institute.

175
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,120
Composing the speech yourself with,
if I may say, evident enthusiasm.

176
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,320
Of course.

177
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:07,680
The uncomplaining, hardworking
countrywomen of Middle England,

178
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,600
you underestimate them at your peril.

179
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:17,360
<i>♪ And did those feet in ancient time ♪</i>

180
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:23,840
<i>♪ Walk upon England's mountains green? ♪</i>

181
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:29,400
<i>♪ And was the holy Lamb of God ♪</i>

182
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:35,720
<i>♪ On England's pleasant pastures seen? ♪</i>

183
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:41,640
<i>♪ And did the countenance divine ♪</i>

184
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:47,720
<i>♪ Shine forth upon our clouded hills? ♪</i>

185
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:51,240
<i>♪ And was Jerusalem... ♪</i>

186
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,880
The Women's Institute movement
came to Britain in 1915.

187
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,320
Since its humble beginnings
in a Welsh garden shed...

188
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:06,440
...our membership and our goals
have reached new and remarkable heights.

189
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,320
I've been a member of the WI
for longer than I've been queen.

190
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,600
Many of you will remember
how vital we were to the war effort,

191
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,000
from growing produce to hosting evacuees.

192
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,200
I have fond memories
of collecting rose hips

193
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,720
for rose hip syrup.

194
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,000
- Do you remember the rose hips?
- Yes.

195
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
For vitamin C deficiency.

196
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,720
There are approximately
250,000 members of the Women's Institute

197
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,160
in the United Kingdom.

198
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,720
Roughly the population of Hull.

199
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,440
Can you imagine a city
run and populated entirely by the WI?

200
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,560
Yes.

201
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,120
It would have
the tidiest streets in Britain.

202
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,160
Yes.

203
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,760
- Everything would run on time.
- Yes.

204
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,640
And we would take all the men's jobs.

205
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:16,120
No, I'm not trying to patronize you.
I'm not trying to make you look-- Yeah.

206
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,760
Yeah, yeah. No, I understand.
All right. Okay, bye-bye.

207
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,280
And then he said,
"Answer me this, Tony..."

208
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,320
Oh, no, please don't do the accent.

209
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,640
"How many ground troops
are y'all prepared to commit?"

210
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:37,840
So I say, "Look, Bill, um,
we can talk about numbers all day."

211
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,000
"This is about the bigger picture.
What if Milosevic wins?"

212
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,920
"NATO's credibility is at stake."

213
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,480
To which he said...

214
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,400
"NATO's credibility is
already a busted flush."

215
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,080
- So you're allowed to do the accent.
- I do it better.

216
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,240
He knows the fact
you're coming to him like this

217
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,480
means that NATO's air campaign has failed.

218
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,480
But he still won't do what it takes.
Commit American ground troops.

219
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,760
It's... he's worried about it
looking like another Vietnam

220
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,120
with no political upside
for him domestically.

221
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,640
Well, you're never going to persuade
the White House

222
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,640
by appealing to their interests.

223
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,920
So do what you do best.

224
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,160
Appeal to their consciences.

225
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,520
<i>While we meet here
in Chicago this evening,</i>

226
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,760
<i>terrible things are happening in Europe.</i>

227
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,080
<i>No one who has seen what has happened
in Kosovo to those refugees</i>

228
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:47,960
<i>can be in any doubt
that NATO's military action is justified.</i>

229
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:55,040
<i>But we must do more
than simply make our case.</i>

230
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,800
<i>We must also succeed.</i>

231
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,080
<i>For that,</i>

232
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,240
<i>we depend on you,</i>

233
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,640
<i>the United States.</i>

234
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,000
<i>You are the most powerful country
in the world,</i>

235
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,880
<i>and the richest.</i>

236
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,440
<i>You are a great nation.</i>

237
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,240
And it must be

238
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,360
difficult, and sometimes irritating,

239
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,320
to find yourself
the recipient of every demand.

240
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,320
To be called upon in every crisis.

241
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,760
To be expected always and everywhere

242
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,760
to do what needs to be done.

243
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:41,760
{\an8}The cry, "What's it got to do with us?"
must be heard fairly regularly.

244
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,080
{\an8}Yet those nations which have the power

245
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,880
have the responsibility to use it wisely.

246
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,840
We need you.

247
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,600
We need America engaged.

248
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,120
And so I say to you,

249
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:06,600
never fall again
for the doctrine of isolationism,

250
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,760
because the world truly cannot afford it.

251
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,440
{\an8}Stay, please, a country outward looking.

252
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,560
{\an8}With the vision and the imagination
which is the very best of your nature.

253
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,920
And realize, too, that in doing so,

254
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,440
you will find in Britain

255
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,320
a friend and an ally

256
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,040
that will stand with you.

257
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,200
Work with you.

258
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,640
Fashion, with you,

259
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,560
the design of a future
built on peace and prosperity for all,

260
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:46,120
which is the only dream
that makes humanity worth preserving.

261
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,840
Thank you.

262
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,360
Bravo!

263
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,160
Thank you.

264
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,960
What a speech!

265
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,760
A resounding success
for the prime minister in America.

266
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,480
<i>The New York Times</i> says
the prime minister has a new nickname.

267
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,600
King Tony.

268
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,120
<i>The Wall Street Journal</i>
has come out in emphatic support

269
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,000
of his attempts to persuade
a reluctant White House,

270
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,320
{\an8}but I think the best summary
is from the <i>Chicago Sun Times.</i>

271
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,400
{\an8}It claims Mr. Blair has beguiled the city
with his charms<i>,</i>

272
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,000
leaving Americans pining
to have him as their president instead.

273
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,080
Goodness.

274
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,320
I gather President Clinton
is now considering ground war,

275
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,240
which would leave Milosevic
and his Serb forces

276
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,200
with the option to either fight
and face total annihilation

277
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,560
or else withdraw.

278
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,000
And I suspect even they are
sensible enough to choose the latter.

279
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,400
So,

280
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,360
the prime minister pulled it off.

281
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,120
So it seems.

282
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,240
This is an extraordinary political feat.

283
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,080
- The prime minister, Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

284
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,880
I hope you didn't slip on the way here.

285
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,280
Ma'am?

286
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,880
It can't be easy
walking on water.

287
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,360
Hmm.

288
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,200
Please, do sit down.

289
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,840
So,

290
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,880
you insisted the West

291
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,440
no longer stand by
while genocide and slaughter take place.

292
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,840
And pulled it off
without a single NATO casualty in combat.

293
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,480
Great credit must go to the Americans.

294
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,040
When they signaled
their openness to a ground invasion,

295
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,160
Milosevic realized the game was up.

296
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,280
But Clinton's change of heart
is in great part thanks to you.

297
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,560
It's one thing to have popularity.

298
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,400
It's quite another to have influence.

299
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,440
So I offer you my congratulations.

300
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,160
You are, at this moment, by some margin,

301
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,720
the most celebrated leader
on the world stage,

302
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,720
with remarkable instincts.

303
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,800
And so,

304
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,600
in the light of that...

305
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:31,400
it's no secret that the Crown has not had
the best time of it in recent years.

306
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,120
Often, our values and those of the country
have not been perfectly aligned.

307
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,040
You, on the other hand,

308
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,000
since you entered Number 10,
you've shown an uncanny ability

309
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,760
to read the mood of the country
better than anyone.

310
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,880
And so I can't help but ask...

311
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,080
what would you do

312
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,600
to turn things around for us?

313
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,200
If you were in charge.

314
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,520
If I were in charge of the monarchy?

315
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,080
If you were in my shoes.

316
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,520
If I were king?

317
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,760
Yes.

318
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,160
Goodness.

319
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,480
For someone who so rarely
puts a foot wrong,

320
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,200
this seems to be
a dangerous loss of judgment.

321
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,800
She's asking for advice.
She doesn't need to take it.

322
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,040
But who is she asking?

323
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,920
- The prime minister.
- An avowed reformer and modernizer.

324
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,320
Her chief advisor.

325
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,640
I'm her chief advisor.

326
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,360
Actually... constitutionally, Robert,
I think you'll find he is.

327
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,720
Can we walk through the five big changes
that we wanna make?

328
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,800
Modernization.

329
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,400
We reduce expenditure.
Everyone's doing it.

330
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,120
It's only fair that the Queen
is doing it as well. Right?

331
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,760
- Some examples.
- Listen to this.

332
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,720
Royal train, fifteen hundred pounds
for catering per journey.

333
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,920
Time to get them
in line with New Labour.

334
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:10,440
Honestly, it's an anachronistic,
unrepresentative feudal system

335
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,160
based on a thousand years
of hereditary privilege.

336
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,200
You'd be better off
trying to modernize Stonehenge.

337
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,280
Let's do the monarchy first, and then
we can get round to prehistoric monuments.

338
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,280
Aren't those two things the same?

339
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,560
Okay, I know it's unexciting,
but administrative reform.

340
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,800
We run the royals
like we run the civil service.

341
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,400
- Yes!
- Accountability.

342
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,280
There's nothing else that matters.
It's just that.

343
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,920
I mean, not being allowed
to marry a Catholic.

344
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:41,240
The Human Rights Act states people have
the right to marry whoever they want.

345
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,600
Says the Queen's counsel.

346
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,360
Well, that's wrong too.
I should be called senior counsel.

347
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,160
<i>I think we can spin it like this.</i>

348
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,000
It would look really good

349
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,480
if it came from the Palace that they're
prepared to tighten the purses.

350
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,680
She knows that there has to be a change.

351
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,760
Yes, yes! The voters
don't wanna take down the monarchy.

352
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,160
Can you put a version of that
in the dossier?

353
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,320
<i>It's all wrong, Tony.</i>

354
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,080
Seriously. Wrong.

355
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,000
Needs changing.

356
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,760
I'd like to start by thanking you
for giving me the opportunity to do this.

357
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,880
Most of the time, we don't think seriously
about the monarchy in this country.

358
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,200
We just subject you all
to a lot of hurtful and frivolous gossip.

359
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,040
Really? I hadn't noticed.

360
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,520
But, uh, having consulted with
my closest advisors,

361
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,440
uh,

362
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,120
we do all agree that the institution
is in need of some reform.

363
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,400
That much was clear after the death
of Diana, Princess of Wales

364
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,960
when we saw an outpouring of grief

365
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,360
turn into a mass movement for change.

366
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:02,160
So I thought we might start with something
I know you're already considering.

367
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,440
Primogeniture.

368
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,360
Yes.

369
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,800
Demoting eldest daughters
in the line of succession,

370
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,600
I think we can all agree,
makes little sense in a modern society.

371
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,200
As an eldest daughter myself,
I don't object to that in principle.

372
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,960
But to turn over centuries
of royal legislation is no small task.

373
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,080
You'd have to consult with
the 15 other countries

374
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,280
where I'm head of state.

375
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:31,000
Where the will is there, these things
can usually change quickly. Um...

376
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,560
Another area is transparency.

377
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:37,280
My government will soon be introducing
a Freedom of Information Act.

378
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,160
I believe the monarchy
might benefit from something similar.

379
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:45,120
An annual report setting out performance,
assets, salaries. Total accountability.

380
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,680
Think of the Crown
as a public limited company

381
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,920
and the people of Britain
as shareholders, not subjects.

382
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,880
I see.

383
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,360
The, um...

384
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:00,120
It's now nearly 300 years since
William III signed the Act of Settlement

385
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,120
to a secure a Protestant monarchy, and

386
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,680
there have been growing calls
for a... a review

387
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,720
of some of
the more anti-Catholic provisions,

388
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,320
which surely have no place
in a plural society like ours.

389
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:20,440
I can understand permitting members
of the royal family to marry Catholics,

390
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,560
but for Catholics to be
in the direct line of succession

391
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,600
would open the way to a Catholic monarch.

392
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,360
Well, of course
there'll be technical issues.

393
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,840
Slightly more than technical issues.

394
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,680
It would be the disestablishment
of the Church of England.

395
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,720
We have to be willing
to look at the big questions.

396
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,920
It's no use nibbling around the periphery.

397
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,000
Should it be the monarch's role
to appoint the prime minister?

398
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,760
Of course. It's a government
in the sovereign's name.

399
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,920
But to be able to dissolve Parliament,
to give laws royal assent...

400
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,320
They don't in Sweden.

401
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,840
These functions can be carried out
by the speaker of the House of Commons.

402
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,720
Should the monarch be
commander-in-chief of the armed forces?

403
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,000
They aren't in Sweden, in the Netherlands,

404
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,200
which brings me to the...
to the matter of pomp and splendor.

405
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,640
I've been looking at
some of the ceremonial offices

406
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,080
in the royal household, and they include

407
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,280
a hereditary Grand Falconer.

408
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,880
Dear Murray. What about him?

409
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,160
Does the job
really need to depend on birth, not merit?

410
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:28,360
Um, the Queen's Herb Strewer
and the Washer of the Sovereign's Hands.

411
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,720
That is only once per reign,

412
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,960
and only when I'm in residence
at Holyroodhouse.

413
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,360
Still, a Royal Bargemaster
and 24 watermen,

414
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,760
even though there hasn't been
a royal barge since 1849.

415
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,640
A Warden of the Swans?

416
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,760
Someone has to oversee the swans
in England's inland waterways,

417
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,680
over which the Crown has
an ancient prerogative right.

418
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,560
But is that prerogative right?

419
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,440
I understand that the role
dates from the 12th century

420
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,440
as a way to claim swans
as delicacies for royal banquets.

421
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:02,040
Now that the swan has, one imagines,
fallen out of the culinary repertoire,

422
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,360
how does one justify the role today?

423
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,960
Kings and queens
might not be eating them anymore.

424
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,840
Someone has to care for them.

425
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,880
We check them for injuries.

426
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,120
Maintain their habitat.

427
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,240
Ring them with tags
from the British Trust for Ornithology.

428
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,320
Conservation.

429
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,360
And that's before
we get to the most anachronistic of all.

430
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,480
Ceremonies.
The State Opening of Parliament.

431
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,000
Do we really need ten heralds?

432
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,720
Including the Rouge Dragon Pursuivant
and the Maltravers Herald Extraordinary?

433
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,560
The Gold Stick in Waiting.
The Silver Stick in Waiting.

434
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,120
The Gentleman Usher of the Sword of State?

435
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,880
I think what we're suggesting is

436
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,000
a purge of honorifics,

437
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,440
a... a bonfire of sinecures
might be a useful concession...

438
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,880
and PR victory.

439
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,320
I obviously need to give
all this careful thought.

440
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,000
Your Majesty.

441
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,400
So, how was it?

442
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,200
- A little frosty.
- I'll bet.

443
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,200
But she promised to give our proposals
some further thought.

444
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,880
Oh... Well, If she doesn't,
and the people get fed up with them,

445
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,720
she'll only have herself to blame.

446
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,000
Britain is mature enough
as a country and a democracy

447
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,880
to live without this nonsense.

448
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,120
The preservation of the monarchy's
her life's work.

449
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:47,000
She must know that they have to change
in order to survive.

450
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,520
No, they don't want to change, Tony.

451
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,400
I mean, she probably thinks
the only way to survive

452
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,120
is to double down on the madness.

453
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,800
Like the Catholic Church.

454
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:03,680
- Let's not bring the church into this.
- Well, they modernized.

455
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,600
And the old guard
has never forgiven them for it.

456
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:11,680
Why? Because they got rid of the Latin
and the incense and the miracles

457
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,360
and the mystery,
and people stopped coming.

458
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,280
This is different.

459
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,840
Is it?

460
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,800
Mr. Hawkins next, please.

461
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,840
Yes.

462
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,760
<i>Please,
make yourself comfortable.</i>

463
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,800
Swans?

464
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,160
That's it. I'm the Warden of the Swans.

465
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,800
It says here your role is
one of the oldest in the household.

466
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,120
That's right, sir.

467
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,880
We've gone through several incarnations
over the years.

468
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,080
The Keeper of the King's Swans,

469
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,480
the King's Swan Master,
and now the Warden of the Swans.

470
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,160
And what is your precise title?

471
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,520
I am the Queen's Herb Strewer.

472
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,760
The Queen's Guide to the Sands.

473
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,200
Yeoman of the Glass and China Pantry.

474
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,760
Could you tell us what your role involves
day by day?

475
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:26,960
It's my job to supervise
the glassware and earthenware

476
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,280
across all the royal palaces.

477
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,480
I oversee stocks.

478
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:35,360
I guard against any damage and breakages.

479
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,160
What have you got there?

480
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,640
<i>Lawes, Orders and Customs for Swans.</i>

481
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:45,320
The authoritative text
for the Keeper of the King's Swans.

482
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,320
<i>It's been guiding us for centuries.
Since 1482, by my reckoning,</i>

483
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,840
<i>and the reign of Edward IV.</i>

484
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,440
Seen the bay change
in all manner of ways.

485
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:59,080
Years of high tides and heavy rainfall
will change sands beyond recognition.

486
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,480
Believe me, I've seen shallow gullies
turn into deep ravines.

487
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,720
<i>What is your official title?</i>

488
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,920
Astronomer Royal.

489
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,400
Piper to the Sovereign.

490
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,320
Lord High Admiral of the Wash, ma'am.

491
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,400
And my responsibilities
also include

492
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:19,480
folding all 170
of the embroidered white linen napkins.

493
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,120
<i>- </i> <i>Oh, that's you!
- Yes, ma'am.</i>

494
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,200
You are clever.
How on earth do you do that?

495
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,640
Few have truly mastered
the Dutch bonnet napkin fold.

496
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,040
"<i>The swan</i>

497
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,840
is a pure and graceful beast."

498
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,960
How is your 15th century calligraphy,
Robert?

499
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,440
A little rusty. Let's see...

500
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,600
"Her feathers are white as snow

501
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,880
and as brief in duration."

502
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:59,240
"For she signifieth
the passing nature of fair things."

503
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:05,320
"For though we wish our splendor
to be everlasting,

504
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:10,920
no thing must remain of what is passed."

505
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:20,320
The longer it went on,
the heavier my heart became.

506
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,840
I agree.

507
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,320
A sense of pride in the tradition.

508
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,600
I think my favorite

509
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,760
was the Yeoman Bed Hanger.

510
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,040
Yes.

511
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,800
Or the Lord High Admiral of the Wash.

512
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:48,360
So they don't want
Black Rod knocking on the door

513
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,200
or the Lord Great Chamberlain
walking backwards?

514
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,080
They've also suggested
getting rid of the cap of maintenance,

515
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,840
presumably on the grounds that it can
only be worn by a peer of the realm.

516
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:02,000
But it's so full
of color and character

517
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,240
and a glorious sea of vermilion.

518
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,800
Well, I think,
from a PR standpoint,

519
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,280
it might be sensible
to make one or two concessions.

520
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,200
Really?

521
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,480
Leave us less open
to charges of elitism and grandiosity.

522
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,200
But that's missing the point.

523
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,800
The whole purpose of the State Opening
is to humble the monarch.

524
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,280
The Crown's representative, Black Rod,

525
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:28,440
knocks on the door of the House of Commons
and is rebuffed three times.

526
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,520
Why?

527
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,440
Because the last time a king

528
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,280
overstepped the mark
and entered the Commons,

529
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,800
Charles I,

530
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,400
it led to civil war and his execution.

531
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,440
Parliament is warning the monarch.

532
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,360
"Never forget,

533
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,520
we are in charge."

534
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:54,000
She still arrives in the Irish state coach
with an escort of household cavalry

535
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,720
and hundreds of guardsmen
lining the route.

536
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,080
It doesn't immediately feel like
a lesson in humility.

537
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,320
Are we really being lectured on humility
by the Prince of Wales?

538
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,240
We are.

539
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,160
I just don't feel there's anything wrong
with running the monarchy on more

540
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,440
rational and democratic lines.

541
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,920
But monarchy isn't rational.

542
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,720
Or democratic or logical or fair.

543
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,360
Haven't we all learned that by now?

544
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,280
People don't want to come to a palace
and get what they could have at home.

545
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:31,320
When they come for an investiture
or a state visit,

546
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:35,040
when they brush up against us,
they want the magic and the mystery.

547
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,320
And the arcane and the eccentric
and the symbolic.

548
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,360
And

549
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,840
the transcendent.

550
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,440
They want to feel like
they've entered another world.

551
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,080
That is our duty.

552
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,560
To lift people up
and transport them into another realm,

553
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,240
not bring them down to earth
and remind them of what they already have.

554
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,440
Hear, hear.

555
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,680
<i>The world has been gripped
as the race for the White House</i>

556
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:07,080
<i>has boiled down to a recount
in the battleground state of Florida.</i>

557
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,520
<i>Many in the Labour Party
had hoped for a victory</i>

558
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,840
<i>for Vice President Al Gore.</i>

559
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:15,280
<i>But, in a dramatic late-night ruling,</i>

560
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,320
<i>the US Supreme Court voted 5-4
to stop the recount,</i>

561
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:24,240
<i>effectively handing the presidency
to Texas governor George W. Bush.</i>

562
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:28,680
<i>Blair's closest international ally will be
a man he has never spoken to or met.</i>

563
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,800
It couldn't have been
more awkward.

564
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,480
The Clintons were making
their farewell visit to the UK

565
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:37,400
and staying with us at Chequers
while the... the ruling was being made.

566
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:42,000
So... there we all were,
watching CNN in the middle of the night

567
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,840
as the election is being decided...

568
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,880
Oh dear.

569
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,320
The following day,
President Clinton had to deliver a speech

570
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:50,480
at the University of Warwick
with me giving the opening remarks.

571
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,120
Well, I had no choice

572
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:55,440
but to offer warm congratulations
to President-Elect Bush

573
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,560
in front of my good friend.

574
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,520
Will it be challenging for you?
To have a Republican White House?

575
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,440
I see no reason not to be optimistic.

576
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,960
Let's not forget,
I'll be the senior partner now,

577
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,920
so I hope to be able
to influence President Bush.

578
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,120
Mm.

579
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,760
Your Majesty.

580
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,840
Prime Minister.

581
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,080
Uh...

582
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:33,000
My office sent suggestions
ahead of the State Opening of Parliament.

583
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,960
I wondered if you had a chance
to look at them?

584
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:39,000
Rather more than that.
I discussed them with my family.

585
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,040
Believe it or not, for my first child,

586
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,640
it was still custom
to summon the home secretary

587
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,640
to witness a royal birth.

588
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,920
My father put a stop to it,
with my consent,

589
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,040
so I'm not against reform.

590
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,280
The question is, what is worth preserving
and where to draw the line.

591
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,480
Thank you.

592
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:03,280
We have now conducted a thorough review
of all the offices in my household,

593
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,600
and what we discovered
was not indefensible extravagance

594
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:10,600
or luxury or a collection
of empty Ruritanian titles,

595
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:14,360
but an extraordinary array
of precious expertise,

596
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:17,640
skills that had been passed down
for generations,

597
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,680
all from within the same families.

598
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,600
And the vehicle for that continuity
is the Crown.

599
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,240
The spell that we cast,

600
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,360
and have cast for centuries,
is our immutability.

601
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,480
Tradition is our strength.

602
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,280
Respect for our forebears

603
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:40,840
and the preservation of generations
of their wisdom and learned experience.

604
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,920
Modernity is not always the answer.

605
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,360
Sometimes antiquity is too.

606
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,640
Very good. Very good.
Are you ready? Are you ready?

607
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,480
All right, there.

608
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,920
Am I disturbing, ma'am?

609
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,880
Oh, Robert. No, not at all.

610
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,080
I just wanted to express my relief, ma'am.

611
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,160
That I came to my senses?

612
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,560
For a moment, we risked compromising
the very things that make us distinctive.

613
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,120
Please.

614
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,920
Which leads me to think...

615
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,760
that it might be best
if I personally were to move on.

616
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,920
Robert.

617
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,360
It's true, ma'am.

618
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,840
At crucial moments, the Palace
has failed to read the public mood.

619
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,200
And much of the blame rests with me.

620
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,600
- Surely not.
- It's a question of temperament.

621
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,600
Knowing when to be flexible.

622
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:52,800
My problem is, I'm an old stick.
I'd rather not change anything at all.

623
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,680
I tend to see things as binary.

624
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,080
Either you keep things as they are

625
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,320
or it's closing time
in the gardens of the West.

626
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:08,120
But you can make alterations
without tearing down the building.

627
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:12,760
My deputy, Robin Janvrin,
is far better placed to do that.

628
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,760
He's much more attuned.

629
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,360
And deserving of a step up.

630
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,280
Of course Robin will make
an excellent private secretary,

631
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,000
but he's still a young man.

632
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,800
Is there nothing I can do
to persuade you to stay?

633
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,440
Sometimes it's helpful to offer a scalp.

634
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,800
This way... everyone benefits.

635
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,720
The public gets sent a signal.

636
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,360
You get better advice
than I could ever possibly give.

637
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,160
I get to play more cricket.

638
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,120
I don't know how I'll manage.
I shall be utterly lost.

639
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,120
No, ma'am, you won't. You'll be just fine.

640
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,960
You've navigated this latest matter
perfectly without my help.

641
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,320
Every minute has been an honor, ma'am.

642
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,600
And finally, ma'am,
your visit to Brighton and Hove

643
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,360
as one of the government's
designated Millennium Cities.

644
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,320
Yes.

645
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,720
I have drafted a program of engagements

646
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:43,760
that I hope preserves the traditional
but adds a somewhat modern sensibility.

647
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,760
On the one hand, lunch at the Pavilion,

648
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,400
in tribute to your
great-great-great-great uncle George IV.

649
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,680
On the other,
a visit to the Sussex Innovation Center

650
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:58,920
to see a demonstration
of an insectoid robot called Maggie.

651
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,000
Right.

652
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,720
One last thing
you might be interested to know.

653
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,840
The prime minister...

654
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:11,760
Yes?

655
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,680
...uh, has chosen to address
the Women's Institute,

656
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:21,560
as part of his mission
to consolidate support in Middle England.

657
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,640
Really?

658
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,640
I wouldn't have said
they were his sort of crowd.

659
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:30,760
But his unerring judgment is what one
has always had to admire him for.

660
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:35,400
And his ability
to win over seemingly... anyone.

661
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,160
I'm sure this will be no exception.

662
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,680
<i>♪ And did those feet ♪</i>

663
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,880

{\an8}<i>- ♪ And did the countenance... ♪</i>
<i>- A modern voice for women.</i>

668
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,360
{\an8}It is a clear and admirable
statement of ideals.

669
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:22,360
But what does it mean
to be modern in a new Britain,

670
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,440
driven by change and innovation?

671
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,080
{\an8}Make no mistake, there are
many traditions we can be proud of,

672
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:32,840
{\an8}but we must never cling to tradition
for its own sake.

673
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,040
{\an8}In the 21st century,

674
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,280
{\an8}we must ask ourselves

675
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,800
what kind of values we want to promote.

676
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:46,120
We must take what's best from the past
but never be in thrall to it.

677
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:52,080
Old-fashioned practices
can sometimes hold progress back.

678
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,320
I believe, and the Labour Party believes,

679
00:42:55,840 --> 00:43:00,640
that a new, updated concept
of community is needed

680
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:04,680
to keep up with the fast pace of change
in the modern world.

681
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,560
I was elected leader of the Labour Party

682
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:10,720
because I understood
that we had a radical mission

683
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,760
to change not just
the politics of this country

684
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,480
but the constitution of this country.

685
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,640
The soul of this country.

686
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:23,080
"Radical" is not a word
to be frightened of.

687
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,560
It is a word to embrace.

688
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:31,920
Because I fear that if we are not radical,
we will not succeed in our mission.

689
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:35,360
Look at what we've done
in the House of Lords, taking...

690
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,760
...taking drastic action
against hereditary privilege.

691
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,440
Thank you very much.

692
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,360
Look, the world is changing fast.

693
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:50,760
Oh, okay, right.

694
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,240
And change is tough. We know that.

695
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:02,560
It's no wonder people feel worried
and wish to hold tight to the old ways,

696
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,400
<i>A run-in
with the Women's Institute</i>

697
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,600
<i>was surely not what
the prime minister had in mind</i>

698
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,800
<i>as he made his return
to the political fray.</i>

699
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,360
<i>The chairwoman of the WI says
that she had urged Mr. Blair</i>

700
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,240
<i>not to make his speech party political.</i>

701
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:18,320
<i>...take on the forces
that prevent vital change, the very--</i>

702
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:21,040
<i>Let the prime minister speak!</i>

703
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,200
No!

704
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:25,480
I'm glad we're having a good debate.

705
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:38,000
<i>He can charm America,
indeed, the whole world,</i>

706
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,880
but comes up short
with the Women's Institute.

707
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,960
I'm getting stick for it from my aides,
who all advised against doing it.

708
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,800
You were political with the WI,

709
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,040
the one thing
we pride ourselves on never being.

710
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,200
Well, as far as criticisms go,

711
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,080
being too political is
one I think I can live with.

712
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,800
It would be like someone
describing you as being too royal.

713
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,600
I think I've come to realize
there's no such thing as too royal.

714
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,640
If you're doing it, do it properly.

715
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:09,440
And unapologetically.

716
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,520
I understand.

717
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,520
So...

718
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,160
So...

719
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,800
I'm sure you're aware,

720
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:30,480
the EU has just published a draft
of its new Charter for Fundamental Rights

721
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,120
ahead of the forthcoming summit
in Portugal.

722
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:37,760
Our hope is that it will
reflect the original remit of the EU,

723
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,760
merely to summarize existing rights.
However, if it...
