1
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,240
Straight to the morgue, sir?

2
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,440
No. Take me to where it happened.

3
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,320
Pont de l'Alma.

4
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,360
There is no power
nor strength except by Allah.

5
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,200
There is no power
nor strength except by Allah.

6
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,040
We retrieved some of the princess' clothes

7
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,480
from Mr. Dodi's apartment.

8
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,560
Gifts she apparently bought for her sons,

9
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,640
and a poem, engraved on a silver plaque.

10
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,720
We believe
it was given to her by Mr. Dodi.

11
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,640
It was a love for the ages.

12
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,400
They were engaged to be married, you know.

13
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,720
Dodi proposed to her last night.

14
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,040
Return the possessions to her family.

15
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,400
I will also write to both the royal family
and the Spencer family.

16
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,480
This tragedy will bring us together.

17
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,680
I am their brother in sorrow.

18
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,280
Mr. President.

19
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,600
Still nothing from the Palace?

20
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,520
No.

21
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,320
But we sent flowers?

22
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,040
Yes.

23
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:14,240
And letters and gifts? No word at all?

24
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,080
No.

25
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,280
And the poem I sent
to be placed in Diana's coffin?

26
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,480
It was returned.

27
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,040
Without acknowledgement.

28
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,120
Why do they hate me?

29
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,000
Is it the fate of Arabs
to always be hated by the West?

30
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,360
Don't take it personally.

31
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,280
How can I not?

32
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:59,600
Look. There's no mention of you anywhere!

33
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,160
It's as if only one person died.

34
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:10,680
But in Cairo, Beirut, Baghdad,
across the whole Arab world,

35
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,320
they are calling me a hero.

36
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,400
You shouldn't look up to the West.

37
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,280
Of course I look up to the West.

38
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,280
You shouldn't.

39
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,920
Exalted expectations are not fair.

40
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,640
They can never be fulfilled.

41
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:48,200
Did I have unfair expectations of you?

42
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,160
Forgive me.

43
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,760
Forgive me.

44
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,360
For failing you.

45
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,000
You were perfect.

46
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,040
No, I wasn't.

47
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,440
Be honest about who I was.

48
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,400
Because wounds will only heal
with the truth.

49
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,640
No, Dodi, no!

50
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,240
Don't leave me!
