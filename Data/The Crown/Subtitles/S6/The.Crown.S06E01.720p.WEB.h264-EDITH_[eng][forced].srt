1
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,400
You going or not?

2
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,680
First, you want to go out, then you don't.

3
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,520
You want to pee, then you don't.

4
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,320
Which is it?

5
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,040
Okay. One last try.

6
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,600
Here? Yes?

7
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,360
Go on.

8
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,480
Hello? Emergency services?

9
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,640
I'm at Pont de l'Alma.
There's been a crash in the tunnel.

10
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,400
I think it's serious.

11
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,640
Hello?

12
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,120
Where are you?

13
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,200
Paris.

14
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:04,440
Choosing fabrics and bedding
for the Malibu house.

15
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,600
The wedding is in three weeks.

16
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,080
It's our last chance.

17
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,800
I don't know whether to laugh or cry.

18
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,960
The greatest opportunity
in history opens up,

19
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,280
and he's choosing fabrics.

20
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,120
I need you to come
to Saint-Tropez immediately.

21
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,880
I have a special guest I need help with.

22
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,560
-What special guest?
-You'll find out when you get here.

23
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,200
But it's a very special guest.

24
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,120
So come alone.

25
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,440
Don't bring Madame Bikini.

26
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,440
Who?

27
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,640
The gold digger.

28
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,400
Leave her in Paris with her swimwear.

29
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,440
Underwear. Fabrics. Pillowcases.

30
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,480
Raise your hand, boy.

31
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,640
What's going on?

32
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,040
What is all this?

33
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,760
Why am I here?

34
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,680
My son.

35
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,000
I would have thought
you would start with a "thank you."

36
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,800
For what?

37
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,640
For putting her on a plate for you.

38
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,480
Who? What are you talking about?

39
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,360
Wait!

40
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,040
What is this?

41
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,640
Are you out of your mind?

42
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,800
This is the craziest idea I ever heard.

43
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,800
Why?

44
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,560
First, because I'm about to get married.

45
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,720
Second, she's not
in the slightest bit interested in me.

46
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:34,040
Then make her interested. Isn't that
what you've always been able to do?

47
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,800
Make women fall in love with you.

48
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,000
This is your chance!

49
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:43,120
Your chance to finally make me
proud of you!
