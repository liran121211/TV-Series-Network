Ah. What about this one?

5
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,760
No.

6
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,760
God, you're 15, not 50.

7
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,400
I like this.

8
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,920
You can't have a Christmas party
without a bit of glitter.

9
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,160
It'll show off your figure,
which the boys'll love.

10
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,640
Mum!

11
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,200
{\an8}Can you remember where we parked?

12
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,440
- No.
- Serves us right for coming up to London.

13
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,480
Look.

14
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,640
Thank you. Merry Christmas.

15
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,040
Oh my God, it's Princess Diana.

16
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,680
Thank you. Merry Christmas.

17
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,080
Know what? Here, can we have
some more of yours? We're selling out.

18
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,280
- Diana, can I have one, please?
- Thank you very much.

19
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,200
Here's a pound.

20
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,480
No, more than that.

21
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,200
There you go.

22
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,840
- Merry Christmas.
- Here you go.

23
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,440
- Oh, sorry.
- Yeah.

24
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,040
Selling like hotcakes.

25
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,720
- Uh, here.
- Ooh, that's very generous.

26
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,440
- What's your name?
- Catherine.

27
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,840
Uh, Kate's fine.

28
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,080
- Say thank you to Kate.
- Uh...

29
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,000
Thank you.

30
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,080
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

31
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,880
Come on. Please.

32
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,280
Someone obviously made an impression.

33
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,920
He seems kind.

34
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,200
Has a nice face.

35
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,600
His mother's face is what he's got.

36
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,760
He has nice eyes too.

37
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,440
Well,

38
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,560
you never know.

39
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,400
Mummy, he's a royal prince.

40
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,840
So?

41
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,600
When I first met your father,
he was way out of my reach.

42
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,640
You know, I was just a lowly stewardess.

43
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,440
Trolley dolly.

44
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,400
While his grandmother had been friendly
with the Queen's aunt.

45
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,960
His father was an RAF pilot
who'd flown with Prince Philip.

46
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,080
I felt like
the luckiest woman in the world.

47
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,440
And then I started the family business

48
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,680
and became so successful
that your dad was able to leave his job

49
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,920
and come and work full-time
for something I'd created.

50
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,120
Then I realized
that maybe it was the other way around.

51
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,280
That he'd been lucky to have me.

52
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,080
Never underestimate yourself.

53
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,320
Never think there's anything in this world
you're not good enough for.

54
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,960
<i>♪ Happy birthday, dear William ♪</i>

55
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,760

56
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,680
{\an8}Drink! Drink! Drink!

57
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,160
Fuckers. Every one of them.

58
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,120
Scum of the earth.

59
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,120
Yeah.

60
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,840
Don't worry, bro.

61
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,680
I've got your back.

62
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,760
Happy birthday.

63
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,720
Thank you.

64
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,480
Until now,
there's been an agreement

65
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,480
that the press won't intrude on
your private life.

66
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,720
Now you're 18 and of age,
are you worried that will change?

67
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,960
I hope not.

68
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,920
Hello! Cup of tea?

69
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,880
Love one.

70
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,080
<i>...press and the public,
which hasn't been easy.</i>

71
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,600
<i>But by giving this interview</i>

72
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,320
<i>and allowing people in here to film me now
before I go to university,</i>

73
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,960
<i>I hope I'll be given
the same kind of freedom there too.</i>

74
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,760
- Have you enjoyed your time at Eton?
- I have. Thank you.

75
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,680
- What will you miss most?
- Me.

76
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,040
- Will you miss Harry?
- Of course.

77
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,760
He's my brother.

78
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,640
- And now it's off to university.
- Hopefully, yes.

79
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,520
Made your choice? There have been
reports you're considering Edinburgh.

80
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,600
<i>I am.</i>

81
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,720
<i>That's assuming I pass my exams first.</i>

82
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,880
He will. He's such a swot.

83
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,760
How do you think you might get along
with the other students?

84
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,920
Particularly those
who might be, uh, anti-monarchists.

85
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,720
He'll have their heads cut off.

86
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,920
I just want to go
to university and have fun.

87
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And girls?

88
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,800
<i>How will you handle the attention?</i>

89
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,640
<i>I'll have enough
to be getting on with</i>

90
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,560
<i>without worrying too much about girls.</i>

91
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,480
From your father, the Prince of Wales.
To wish you good luck with your exams.

92
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,040
A-level geographers,
that is the end of your time.

93
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,760
Finish the sentence you're writing
and then pens down.

94
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,040
Please place your exam script
on the left-hand side of your desk

95
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,600
to be collected.

96
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,480
Now Granny's here.

97
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,800
We can start.

98
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,760
Whatever they are,
just know we're already immensely proud.

99
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,040
What rot!

100
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,960
Only straight As will do.

101
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,960
Philip!

102
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,440
- Right.
- Well, come on.

103
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,760
Well?

104
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,360
Is that a... good frown?

105
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,280
Don't keep us in suspense.

106
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,600
C in biology.

107
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,840
- Oh, well...
- C in what?

108
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,800
Biology, Mummy.

109
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,960
- Oh.
- A in geography.

110
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,120
Oh, very good.

111
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,040
- Aren't you clever?
- A in what?

112
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,720
- Oh, someone tell her.
- Geography, Granny.

113
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,800
That must be
the only A ever in this family.

114
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,840
- And B in history of art.
- Bravo!

115
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,080
- B in what?
- Oh, somebody shoot her.

116
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,960
- History of art.
- What?

117
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,640
History of fart.

118
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,800
- Well done, William. You're in.
- Yeah.

119
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,840
- Well done.
- Well done. Here.

120
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,560
Since you'll be flying the nest soon.
And because accidents do happen.

121
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,520
- You'll all be thanking me later.
- Oh, what is it?

122
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,200
Oh, for God's sake, Harry, don't let--

123
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,960
What are they? Sweeties?

124
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,560
- Condom.
- Putting them in your mouth is optional.

125
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,800
- I'll have that.
- Just a bit of advice.

126
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,120
- What?
- Hmm? What?

127
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,040
<i>Prince William is due
to hold a press conference shortly.</i>

128
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,840
<i>We're expecting him to be announcing
his plans for university life after Eton.</i>

129
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,840
Okay. Yeah.

130
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,160
If you have any issues...

131
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,400
Yeah, okay, good.

132
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,760
Congratulations.
How's the proud father feeling today?

133
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,280
Oh, couldn't be happier.

134
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,840
Have you decided
where you're going yet, William?

135
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,640
Well, um, I was lucky enough

136
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:32,040
to meet the conditions of my first choice.
So it's going to be St. Andrews.

137
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,280
<i>Not Edinburgh?</i>

138
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,920
<i>No. I considered it,</i>

139
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,080
<i>but St. Andrews is closer to Balmoral.</i>

140
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,160
<i>And the academic course there
sounds excellent.</i>

141
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,440
Are you looking forward to Freshers' Week?

142
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,800
Uh, well, after thinking it all through,

143
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,000
and after a long discussion
with my father,

144
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,320
uh, we've decided
that I'm going to be taking a gap year.

145
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,480
It'll be character building.

146
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,600
And, of course, St. Andrews will still
be waiting for him when he gets home.

147
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,160
Do you know
how you'll be spending it yet?

148
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,160
Well, there's a survival course
I want to go on in Belize,

149
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,120
<i>then Chile
with the Raleigh International Expedition</i>

150
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,480
<i>where I'll be helping out at a school.</i>

151
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,600
<i>Then Botswana,</i>

152
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,440
<i>then Kenya, where I'll be
staying in a rhino sanctuary.</i>

153
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,800
<i>And then after that, St. Andrews.</i>

154
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,560
Yes, good boy.

155
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,560
No, no, no! No!

156
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,520
Yeah!

157
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,320
Lovely to meet you. Thank you very much.

158
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,840
Lovely to meet you. Sorry about the noise.

159
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,480
Nice to meet you.

160
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,400
Nice to meet you.

161
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,920
Hello. Are you students?

162
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,560
Right. I think it's time
for parents to disappear

163
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,000
and the wild parties to begin.

164
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,320
Not too much chance of wild parties
with him watching my every move.

165
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,480
Oh, I'm sure he can be persuaded
to look away sometimes.

166
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,960
I didn't say that.

167
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,280
Good luck.

168
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,840
<i>A bit of housekeeping
before we begin.</i>

169
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,280
<i>You should all now be able
to access information</i>

170
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,080
<i>through the student web portal.</i>

171
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,960
<i>In this, your first semester,</i>

172
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:33,440
<i>we'll be covering medieval
and Renaissance art up to 1600.</i>

173
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,720
<i>If you need to share books
or other material,</i>

174
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,360
<i>we've provided a list
of all your fellow students' names</i>

175
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,280
with email addresses
and telephone numbers.

176
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:49,760
40% of your assessment will be
based on a midterm visual analysis...

177
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,320
Hi, lovely to meet you.

178
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,800
- Could you sign the picture?
- Yeah, of course.

179
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,160
Sorry, can you take that off? Thank you.

180
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,320
There you go.
Yeah, I do really need to get to...

181
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,520
Uh, thank you. Thank you.

182
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,720
There you go. Okay, lovely to meet you.

183
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,840
Have a nice day, okay? Okay.

184
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,960
Any idea what this is?

185
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,040
<i>The Ognissanti Madonna.</i>

186
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,840
That's right. <i>The Madonna Enthroned.</i>

187
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,280
Which is considered by many

188
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,400
to be the first significant painting
of the Renaissance.

189
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,960
It encourages an emotional connection
with the viewer.

190
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,720
How do you think Giotto achieves this?

191
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,800
Is it by painting people
as quite lifelike and realistic?

192
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,960
Exactly.
Giotto was one of the first artists

193
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,800
to create three-dimensional figures
in Western European art.

194
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,480
Plan tonight?

195
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,200
- Pint, golf?
- Yeah.

196
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,240
- Ooh...
- Both at the same time.

197
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,160
- Go! Go, go.
- Wish me luck.

198
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,480
Absolutely.

199
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,760
- Very down for it.
- I would love--

200
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,480
Excuse me, Your Royal Highness...

201
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,480
- Oh, please don't call me that.
- Sorry.

202
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,960
Could you sign this, please?
It's for my grandma.

203
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,160
She's a huge fan of the royal family.

204
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,240
- Sure.
- Thank you.

205
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,880
Thanks.

206
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,800
At least you're a hit
with the grannies, Will.

207
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,640
Honestly, what I wouldn't give...

208
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,040
I'm gonna literally get all my...

209
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,800
- Hey!
- Oh, hi!

210
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,760
- These books on the list?
- I've got her phone number.

211
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,760
Already?

212
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,600
I salute you. Respect.

213
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,960
We're on the same course,
which means I automatically get it.

214
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,880
That's a bit lazy.

215
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,640
We've already crowned her
the fittest girl in Sallies.

216
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,680
Yeah, but not literally crowned,
of course.

217
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,600
- That's, you know, your thing.
- Ha-ha.

218
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,680
What's her name?

219
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,520
- Kate.
- Beautiful Kate.

220
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,560
- Puts the Kate in intoxic-Kate-ing.
- Oh, that was good.

221
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,600
Yeah. Yeah.

222
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,680
Mother runs some kind of party business
and used to be,

223
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,840
wait for it, an air hostess.

224
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,840
<i>So, how is university life?</i>

225
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,080
- <i>Still getting used to it all.</i>
- Do you know anyone there?

226
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,560
<i>Fergus Boyd,
Oli Chadwyck-Healey, Charlie Nelson.</i>

227
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,920
Anyone <i>not</i> from Eton?

228
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,440
What about girls?

229
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,080
Well, obviously,
there are girls.

230
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,960
Any, you know,

231
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:43,920
woof?

232
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,440
- Are you for real?
<i>- Are</i> you <i>for real, more like?</i>

233
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,720
You frigid weirdo.

234
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,120
University is just sex.

235
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
With books.

236
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,760
Get stuck in.

237
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:01,040
Sire some... illegitimate bastards
and alter the lines of succession.

238
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,040
Or

239
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,800
swallow some hallucinogenic mushrooms
and have a fist fight with the local oiks.

240
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:13,000
<i>Anything, just... promise me
you'll try not to be quite so...</i>

241
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,120
- What?
<i>- Uptight.</i>

242
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,200
Repressed.

243
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,520
Responsible and boring.

244
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,840
<i>If you want to be
treated like everyone else,</i>

245
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,160
<i>you've got to</i> act <i>like everyone else.</i>

246
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,760
<i>What are you so scared of?</i>

247
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,520
<i>Go mad.</i>

248
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,680
All right, I've gotta go, but...

249
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,640
speak to you later.

250
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,480
<i>♪ Love might bring us back together ♪</i>

251
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,360
<i>♪ Ooh, baby ♪</i>

252
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,000
<i>♪ I feel right

00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,400

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,920
<i>♪ I feel so good... ♪</i>

255
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,280
Come on. Let's go.

256
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,000
- Was that a smile?
- What?

257
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,560
- Did she smile when she went past?
- Didn't see.

258
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,120
You're useless.
You're supposed to see everything.

259
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,800
I'm on the lookout
for assassins and kidnappers.

260
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,840
Maybe this is more important. Keep up.

261
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,200
Jesus.

262
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,920
- William, is this your new girlfriend?
- Oh my God.

263
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,040
- On your way.
- Piss off. What's it to you, you pervert?

264
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,200
Come on. Come on!

265
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,400
- Is that your girlfriend?
- Come on, let's go!

266
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,400
Shit!

267
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,200
- Take your menu. Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

268
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,480
Come on!

269
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,920
Lola Airdale-Cavendish-Kincaid.

270
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,280
What?

271
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,840
From a family so posh
they had to name it thrice.

272
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,880
When it comes to bagging a prince,
only genuine blue bloods need apply.

273
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,560
Hi. I've got an apple,
cheese and pickle sandwich, and a water.

274
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,640
- Uh, it's three pounds fifteen.
- Okay.

275
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,680
There you go.

276
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,280
- Hey.
- Hi.

277
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,480
Sorry, could you help me
look for some books?

278
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,000
For an assignment?

279
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Uh, yes. Uh, history of art.

280
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,920
Uh, we are looking at the--

281
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,280
Reading list.

282
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,080
Oh, there.

283
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,760
Right.

284
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:51,960
<i>Essays in the Study of Sienese Painting.</i>

285
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,400
On loan.

286
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:01,440
<i>The Frescoes in Siena's Palazzo Pubblico.</i>

287
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,560
Volume 1.

288
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,000
Nope.

289
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,560
<i>Sienese Quattrocento Painting</i>,
definitely not.

290
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,080
Sorry, all out of luck here.

291
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,360
Miss Middleton beat you to it.

292
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,320
Thanks.

293
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,120
Psst.

294
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,920
So that's where all the material went.

295
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,040
- Hi.
- Hello.

296
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,800
Actually, I'm done with it now.

297
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,000
- Great.
- But I've promised it to someone else.

298
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,240
- I think she promised it to someone else.
- Yeah.

299
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,280
But you're welcome to the notes I made.
And the essay I've written if it'll help.

300
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,600
It's no masterpiece,
but I put the research in there.

301
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,520
Thanks, that--

302
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,080
- When you're done, text and let me know.
- Yeah.

303
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,440
Or cut a hole in your ceiling
and give it back.

304
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,480
I'm in the room directly above you.

305
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,200
Oh, so it's you
that's been keeping me up at night.

306
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,320
Oh, my roommate. If it's any consolation,
her noise keeps me up too.

307
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,440
Yeah.

308
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:16,160
I only know it's you in the room below
because they came to sweep us for bugs.

309
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:20,120
I told them if I was out to get you,
I could have just done that in Chile.

310
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,360
On the gap year
Raleigh International Expedition.

311
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,640
- Did you do that too?
- I did, yeah.

312
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,160
We missed each other by a week.

313
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,160
Really? Um...

314
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,400
It was...

315
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,560
- It was tough, wasn't it?
- It was, yeah.

316
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,040
Yeah, but hacking through rainforest...

317
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,880
Yeah.

318
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,640
Uh, how did you do?

319
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,400
All right, I think.
With my trusty machete.

320
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,480
Yeah.

321
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,040
I bet you excelled.

322
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,240
You seem like the type
who excels at everything.

323
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,600
There are people
with high expectations of me.

324
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,680
I don't want to let them down.

325
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,600
I'm sure I don't have to tell you
what that's like.

326
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,760
- Yeah.
- Hi.

327
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,120
Oh.

328
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,360
Hi. Hi.

329
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,160
Hi.

330
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,520
Sorry, Lola, Kate.

331
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,800
- Hi.
- Hi.

332
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,680
We were just discussing--

333
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,640
How Kate excels at everything she does.
I overheard.

334
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,920
Well, Lola is an exceptional person too.

335
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,640
In which area?
Apart from her hearing, that is.

336
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,880
Oh, drama.
She's done a bit of acting.

337
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,640
You're speaking for me now?
"This is Lola, my ventriloquist puppet."

338
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,080
And what is
your area of exceptionalism, Kate?

339
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,320
We were just discussing an expedition
we both did in South America.

340
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,000
You're speaking for her now too?

341
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,360
Which involved weeks
of long-distance hiking

342
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,040
and living off those ration packs.

343
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,360
Bathing in ice-cold buckets of water
each morning.

344
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,040
Bracing and outdoorsy.

345
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,680
Such fun.

346
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,080
I'm learning that about you.

347
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,000
We haven't been dating very long.

348
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,400
How much you like outdoorsy.

349
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,360
- Well, I do, actually.
- Sneaky.

350
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,600
After telling me you were interested in
cinema and politics.

351
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,120
I, uh...

352
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:11,080
Don't outdoorsy, cinema,
and politics go together?

353
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,320
Only as oxymorons, yeah.

354
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,200
And you also like flirting
as soon as my back is turned.

355
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,560
- And hitting on other people.
- What?

356
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,640
We're on the same course.

357
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,600
- We were just talking about an essay.
- And how exceptional Kate is.

358
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,360
- Would you mind signing this?
- Yes, as it happens, I would.

359
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,560
We're talking.

360
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,640
Just go away.

361
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,640
Please.

362
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,720
Oh, okay.

363
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,000
Wow.

364
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,960
What?

365
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,480
- That was--
- Weirdly rage-aholic.

366
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,040
They were only being friendly.

367
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,680
Interrupting someone when they're talking
is the opposite of friendly. It's rude.

368
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,680
- Okay. I really should go.
- Me too.

369
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,480
No, I don't think you understand.
I get that all the time.

370
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,480
You have no idea what it's like
to live with that day-in, day-out.

371
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,480
Don't we?

372
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,200
What, being ogled?

373
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,720
Looked at and judged constantly?

374
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,520
Try being a girl.

375
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,640
A fit girl.

376
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,360
No, try being <i>any</i> girl.

377
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,040
Failing that, you could
at least try to be a human being,

378
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,560
while not reducing every woman
to whether she's fit.

379
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,920
Oh f...

380
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,800
Can I just...

381
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,800
<i>Today, we'll be moving on
to another topic. Patronage.</i>

382
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:57,480
The system under which the arts flourished
in city states like Florence and Venice,

383
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,680
and the circumstances
under which the system came to exist.

384
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,640
To begin with, we'll discuss

385
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,400
some of the greatest patrons
in 15th century Florence.

386
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,120
Page two.

387
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,200
The Medici family,

388
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,920
who also ruled the city.

389
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,520
Now, one of the painters they employed...

390
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,680
- <i>I'm not coming.</i>
<i>- What do you mean?</i>

391
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,560
I've been given a cottage at Balmoral.
Invited some friends.

392
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,760
Oh, some real friends.
What are we, chopped liver?

393
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:28,760
You can't not go. Raisin Weekend
is a first-year rite of passage.

394
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,800
- Everyone goes.
- Twenty-four hours of drinking.

395
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,280
The largest outdoor
shaving cream fight on the planet.

396
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:37,000
You've got your whole life
to slaughter animals or peasants.

397
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,040
- You know, whatever you do up there.
- With your real friends.

398
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,520
When you going to get another
opportunity to do something like this?

399
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,120
Is this about Lola?

400
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,600
No. God no, that's over.

401
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,520
Or Kate?

402
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,440
Ollie said you made an arse
of yourself with her in the library.

403
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,120
- Thanks.
- Been kicking yourself since.

404
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,040
Can we just change the subject, please?

405
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,760
Okay.

406
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,920
<i>Just check that's empty.</i>

407
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:12,360
Willie, remember when Badger, like,
buzzed my hair and came straight for me?

408
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,960
He came straight for me.

409
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,440
- Thank you.
- Enjoy your day.

415
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,400
- What?
- Are you okay? Do you want some food?

416
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,840
- No. I'm not...
- It will help.

417
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,040
- I'm all right, I'm fine.
- Have some water.

418
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,440
I'm fine.

419
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,160
- I'm not thirsty. Why the fu--?
- Okay.

420
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,640
How's it going?

421
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,320
<i>I hate to say it, mate.
You are missing out.</i>

422
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:20,000
Not least because with your back turned,
Kate is getting a lot of attention.

423
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,040
Well, that's helpful.

424
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,600
Thanks, mate.

425
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,720
<i>You'll just have to woo her
when you get back.</i>

426
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,560
But you better make it quick.
The boat is sailing, my friend.

427
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,360
<i>Anyway, how's Balmoral?</i>

428
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,320
It's... Uh, it's good. Um...

429
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,360
Yes, it's not bad. We went...
We went shooting earlier.

430
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,720
And, uh, now we're just
back in the cottage, and...

431
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,840
- Listen, I...
- Chad, come on!

432
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,760
I have to go.

433
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,440
I'll talk to you later, yeah? Bye.

434
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,440
<i>It's been a long slog</i>

435
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:06,320

439
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,440
Wales, help me out.

440
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,400
Hi.

441
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,400
No.

442
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,360
Did you?

443
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,160
Sorry, Kate?

444
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:55,360
- From the drinking?
- Kate. Uh, have you got a second?

445
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,600
Excuse me. Um...

446
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,880
I... I just wanted to apologize

447
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,720
for, um, how I was.

448
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,920
In the library?

449
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,760
It was an awkward situation.

450
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,760
Even more awkward than this.

451
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,320
Sorry. Sorry, uh...

452
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,080
- Rupert, William.
- Hi. Finchie.

453
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,080
Hi. Um...

454
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,200
Yeah, I was out of my depth.
And I behaved like a real idiot.

455
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,400
Thanks.

456
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,480
- And I hope you patch things up with Lola.
- God no.

457
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,800
That was dead
the minute she found out I was outdoorsy.

458
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,280
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

459
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,040
Yeah.

460
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,120
Shall we?

461
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,360
Yeah, anyway, I'll, um...
I'll see you in lectures, I guess.

462
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,360
Uh, nice to meet you.

463
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,320
Yeah, you too.

464
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,560
Bye.

465
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:58,400
<i>♪ O little town of Bethlehem... ♪</i>

466
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,560
So tell us all about university. Mm?

467
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,320
Lots of lovely parties?

468
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,640
Uh...

469
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:09,600
A few parties.
But, um, nothing especially exciting.

470
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,360
You must have made new friends?

471
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,280
A couple.

472
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:17,800
But, um, St. Andrews can feel
quite small and... remote.

473
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,920
And the course.

474
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:24,520
I used to enjoy history of art at school.
But now I struggle to see the point in it.

475
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,480
- Oh, that's sad.
- Yeah.

476
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,440
The girl he likes
has found herself a <i>real</i> man.

477
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,120
I think that's why
he's feeling sorry for himself.

478
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,960
- Oh...
- Oh, what a shame.

479
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,880
- Thank you.
- Poor William, darling...

480
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,840
Really!

481
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,800
You'll stick it out.
You're not actually thinking of leaving?

482
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,520
Maybe changing subjects would help.

483
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,920
What was your other
favorite subject at school?

484
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,920
Geography.

485
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,120
Well, then, what better
when you're feeling a little lost?

486
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,640
- Yes.
- It is all orienteering.

487
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:55,680
The important thing
is these chocolates.

488
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,240
Knock, knock.

489
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:05,960
Granny.

490
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:10,800
- Oh God, sorry about the mess.
- I came to see if you were all right.

491
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,040
University hasn't been easy,
by the sounds of it.

492
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,120
No.

493
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,920
If what Harry said is true,

494
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,400
and your dissatisfaction
has more to do with

495
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,040
affairs of the heart...

496
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Well, what else would one call it?

497
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,800
Um...

498
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,920
- Dating.
- Oh, yes.

499
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,320
I don't know that word
because we didn't do that.

500
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,960
We met someone,
then married them and got on with it.

501
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,240
There's certainly no danger of marriage
in this case.

502
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,720
There's no danger of dating either.
I've made a mess of it.

503
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,880
And you don't want to hear
anything about other fish in the sea?

504
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,240
Or encouragement to make another go of it?

505
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,960
Well, if I did that, it would be
another word you don't know.

506
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,880
Stalking.

507
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,760
- Actually, I do know that word.
- Oh.

508
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,120
Don't lose faith.

509
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,480
I'm a firm believer

510
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,600
that what is meant for you
won't pass you by.

511
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,600
He makes sure of that.

512
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,080
Oh...

513
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,200
Are you all right?

514
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,880
- You okay?
- Yeah, looking forward to it.

515
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,480
Hello!

516
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,600
- Hello, sweetheart!
- Hi, Dad, how are you?

517
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,320
- Lovely to see you. Come on in.
- Good to see you. Hey, James.

518
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,960
- Rupert.
- Rupert, very nice to meet you. Come in.

519
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,400
- Hey, man. Rupert. Nice to meet you.
- I'm good.

520
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,720
- Hello, darling.
- Hi. Rupert. Nice to meet you.

521
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,920
- Merry Christmas.
- Happy Christmas, darling.

522
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,160
Mum, Dad, this is Rupert.

523
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,240
- Rupert. Nice to meet you.
- Rupert.

524
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,440
Covered in slime and God knows what,

525
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,400
and about a pint and a half
of rancid river water in my stomach.

526
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,200
God. Still got man of the match
though, right?

527
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,920
I mean, is there a name
for a hat trick of own goals?

528
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,520
- I don't know.
- Idiocy?

529
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,240
Thank you. Thank you.

530
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,160
- James is gonna be our little star.
- I can tell.

531
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,320
- He had a very good season.
- Really?

532
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,280
Yeah, he got four wickets.
Four for 20.

- Come on!
- What's that you're playing?

539
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:45,520
You've just walked in
on a very competitive game of Jenga.

540
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,840
- I'm gonna go and grab a cigarette.
- I'll come and join you in a second.

541
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,360
Harry? Where are you going?

542
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,160
- Uh, I'm just going outside.
- No, look, stay here.

543
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,000
What's the problem?

544
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,800
I want you
to stay with the family.

545
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,120
What's the problem?

546
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,440
I'm your father, so don't argue.

547
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,040
Sure you are. When it suits you.

548
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,520
- Harry.

551
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,240
Yeah, so much fun.

552
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,440
My dad loves the cricket talk.

553
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,640
Bye.

554
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,400
He seems nice.

555
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,280
You think so?

556
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,880
Very.

557
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,440
What's not to like?

558
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,560
He's polite. And handsome.

559
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,320
Is it serious?

560
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,120
Why does everyone keep asking me that?

561
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,880
Catherine?

562
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,920
Is it serious?

563
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,520
Quite.

564
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,240
If that's okay with you.

565
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,480
Course.

566
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,160
Why wouldn't it be?

567
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,280
'Cause you've always had your sights
on someone else for me.

568
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,920
Come on.

569
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,280
You've always loved the idea
of me and William together.

570
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,080
I was all set
to go to Edinburgh University

571
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,640
straight after school with all my friends.

572
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,320
Then <i>you</i> suggested
I change it to St. Andrews

573
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,120
after a gap year.

574
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,640
With none of my friends.

575
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,440
- That was no coincidence.
- Yes, it was.

576
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:08,600
Was it a coincidence you encouraged me
to sign up to the art course in Florence

577
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,440
where William was expected to go?

578
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:14,760
And then to the expedition
in Chile as well. Where he went.

579
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,320
I thought you'd thank me.

580
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,040
<i>You</i> said you liked him.

581
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,800
Yes, well, then I grew up.

582
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,560
Once you had the idea fixed in your head,
you never stopped.

583
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,640
Yes, but not for any sinister reason.

584
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,880
- Really?
<i>- </i>  Do you know what I think?

585
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,920
I think you're special.

586
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:41,400
I also happen to think
that poor boy needs a nice, normal girl.

587
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,400
You don't know him.

588
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,640
Well, I mean, what if William
isn't right for me?

589
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,920
What about what I want?

590
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,720
If what you really want is Finchie,
then that's fine.

591
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:57,120
I just don't want you to be seeing Finchie
'cause you're making a point to me.

592
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,960
Come on.

593
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:12,000
Especially since
I've heard on the grapevine that

594
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,200
William is miserable.

595
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,720
And wants to leave university.

596
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:35,840
All right?

597
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,400
Hello.

598
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,440
Thanks.

599
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,920
You're not really gonna do it.

600
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,600
What?

601
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,640
Leave uni.

602
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,520
Haven't decided.

603
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,400
Stop muscling in on my territory.

604
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:13,440
I know my job, to be the fuck-up
in this family. Don't you start too.

605
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,720
Go back to St. Andrews.

606
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,840
If not for your sake,
then for mine. I need a...

607
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,840
purpose in life.

608
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,600
Screw up and make you look

609
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,640
good.

610
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,440
What's going on with you and Pa?

611
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,320
He found out about the weed, didn't he?

612
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,360
Went ballistic.
Said I could have got myself expelled.

613
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,720
Now he wants me
to go to a treatment center

614
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,640
to spend the day with some addicts.

615
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,640
What?

616
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,560
"Bit of an overreaction," I said.

617
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:00,800
"Remorse and responsibility," he said.

618
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,040
Thanks.

619
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,800
'Cause it'll be in all the papers.

620
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,920
And make me look like a lost cause. Again.

621
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,360
People will say,
"Poor boy, ever since his mother died..."

622
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,760
But I guess
it's all working out perfectly.

623
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,520
'Cause there's no need
for a number two in this family.

624
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,520
Except as entertainment.

625
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:38,760
I can't be normal or a success, can I?
And eclipse you in any way.

626
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,840
That would make a mockery
of the whole show.

627
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:48,240
So it's Willy Gold Star,
Harry Black Sheep.

628
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,320
Willy Saint, Harry Sinner.

629
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,480
Willy Solid, Harry Lost.

630
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,040
A fucking treatment center.

631
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,800
Can you imagine
how people would freak out if

632
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,560
<i>you</i> were the one
who was going to a treatment center?

633
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,080
It would be like
the temple was falling down.

634
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,400
With me, it's just what people want.

635
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:22,600
Fucking up.

636
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,480
"Ah, that's Harry Wales' job."
