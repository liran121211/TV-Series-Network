00:00:29,165 --> 00:00:31,925
- [knocking at door]
- Yes.

5
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:41,125
Ah, there you are. Come in.

6
00:00:41,205 --> 00:00:46,485
I'm practicing for the big day tomorrow
and I need an Archbishop.

7
00:00:54,085 --> 00:00:57,765
Will you do me the honour? From here.

8
00:01:02,965 --> 00:01:05,845
"Is Your Majesty willing
to take the oath?"

9
00:01:07,165 --> 00:01:08,165
I am...

10
00:01:10,565 --> 00:01:11,565
willing.

11
00:01:12,725 --> 00:01:15,645
"Will you maintain and preserve in...

12
00:01:16,925 --> 00:01:18,005
invi..."

13
00:01:23,365 --> 00:01:25,845
Ah. Inviolably.

14
00:01:25,925 --> 00:01:31,845
It means... to make a promise
you can... you can never break.

15
00:01:32,765 --> 00:01:35,965
A very sacred promise indeed.

16
00:01:37,165 --> 00:01:38,925
- [knocking at door]
- Yes!

17
00:01:40,965 --> 00:01:44,485
- We're ready for you, sir.
- Oh, not yet, Tommy.

18
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:49,045
We haven't even reached the anointing.

19
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:53,365
You have to anoint me,
otherwise, I can't...

20
00:01:55,965 --> 00:01:56,965
be King.

21
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:00,365
Do you understand?

22
00:02:02,245 --> 00:02:04,765
When the holy oil touches me,

23
00:02:06,325 --> 00:02:10,445
I am tr... I am transformed.

24
00:02:12,405 --> 00:02:17,845
Brought into direct contact
with the divine.

25
00:02:20,365 --> 00:02:22,725
For... forever changed.

26
00:02:25,325 --> 00:02:26,565
Bound to God.

27
00:02:28,485 --> 00:02:33,365
It is the most important part
of the entire ceremony.

28
00:02:34,645 --> 00:02:38,325
So we had better practice,
hadn't we, archbishop?

29
00:02:42,285 --> 00:02:46,165
"Be thy hands, anointed, with holy oil.

30
00:02:52,285 --> 00:02:56,165
Be thy breast, anointed, with holy oil.

31
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:12,365
Be thy head, anointed, with holy oil.

32
00:03:14,205 --> 00:03:18,685
As kings, priests and prophets
were anointed."

33
00:03:29,085 --> 00:03:33,565
- Goodness. That's very heavy indeed.
- Five pounds, sir.

34
00:03:34,645 --> 00:03:39,125
Not to mention the, uh,
symbolic weight, hm?

35
00:03:51,685 --> 00:03:54,605
There's a sight I hoped I'd never see.

36
00:04:35,925 --> 00:04:38,045
It's not as easy as it looks.

37
00:04:39,885 --> 00:04:41,965
That's exactly what the King said.

38
00:04:44,245 --> 00:04:45,245
I remember.

39
00:04:48,525 --> 00:04:52,405
Do you suppose I could borrow it
for a couple of days?

40
00:04:52,485 --> 00:04:53,725
Just to practice.

41
00:04:54,805 --> 00:04:57,645
Borrow it, ma'am? From whom?

42
00:04:58,725 --> 00:05:02,085
If it's not yours, whose is it?

43
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:32,565
[Charles] Be quiet, Anne.

44
00:06:33,765 --> 00:06:34,765
[whispers] Ready?

45
00:06:41,845 --> 00:06:44,965
Close your eyes,
and don't open them until I say so.

46
00:06:52,885 --> 00:06:56,365
- Oh, any idea where the Duke is?
- His Royal Highness went flying, ma'am.

47
00:06:56,445 --> 00:06:58,005
[Anne] Daddy?

48
00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:59,085
Again?

49
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:06,285
So when's the big day?

50
00:07:07,765 --> 00:07:09,965
Pilot's exam? Two weeks.

51
00:07:10,925 --> 00:07:14,085
- Are you still on track for the record?
- I am. Just.

52
00:07:14,165 --> 00:07:18,405
- If I do nothing else.
- Oh, then you'll hate me.

53
00:07:18,485 --> 00:07:19,645
Why?

54
00:07:19,725 --> 00:07:21,845
There was something
I wanted you to help me with.

55
00:07:21,925 --> 00:07:23,845
It would've to be jolly important
to distract me

56
00:07:23,925 --> 00:07:26,765
from getting my wings faster than anyone
in British aviation history.

57
00:07:26,845 --> 00:07:30,685
It is. I'd like you to come aboard
my Coronation Committee.

58
00:07:33,485 --> 00:07:37,205
- In which capacity?
- As Chairman.

59
00:07:37,285 --> 00:07:40,725
But you already have one. Bernard.

60
00:07:40,805 --> 00:07:44,005
I'd ask the Duke of Norfolk
to make room for you.

61
00:07:44,085 --> 00:07:46,965
I want to make a public declaration
of my trust in you.

62
00:07:47,045 --> 00:07:49,725
- There's no need to matronize me.
- I'm not matronizing you.

63
00:07:49,805 --> 00:07:51,685
Yes, you are. You're taking pity on me

64
00:07:51,765 --> 00:07:54,005
and giving me a job,
for appearance's sake.

65
00:07:54,085 --> 00:07:55,605
No, it's not that.

66
00:07:55,685 --> 00:07:58,165
I was just thinking how I'd like us
to spend more time together.

67
00:07:58,245 --> 00:08:00,605
What are you talking about?
We spend all our time together.

68
00:08:00,685 --> 00:08:04,645
No, we don't. You're always off flying,
or lunching with strange men.

69
00:08:04,725 --> 00:08:07,725
A few hours a week, darling.
Anyway, what else am I supposed to do?

70
00:08:07,805 --> 00:08:10,045
Sit around and wait for you
while you're Queening?

71
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:12,925
- Queening?
- Yes. Queening.

72
00:08:13,005 --> 00:08:14,725
Maybe I'd like your help
with the Queening.

73
00:08:14,805 --> 00:08:17,725
Oh, in the same flattering way
you asked me to redecorate Clarence House?

74
00:08:17,805 --> 00:08:21,005
- Well, you did that jolly well.
- I felt like a sissy.

75
00:08:21,085 --> 00:08:23,325
Fussing about curtain fabrics
and paint charts.

76
00:08:23,405 --> 00:08:25,645
Honestly,
it's just queening of another sort.

77
00:08:27,765 --> 00:08:28,765
[chuckling]

78
00:08:35,445 --> 00:08:37,005
What would it entail?

79
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:41,245
Well,
the Duke of Norfolk will run the show

80
00:08:41,325 --> 00:08:44,725
from an organizational perspective,
look after the seating,

81
00:08:44,805 --> 00:08:47,485
the root of the procession,
but as Chairman of the Committee,

82
00:08:47,565 --> 00:08:52,005
you would have an input on ideas,
inspire everyone, lead them.

83
00:08:52,085 --> 00:08:54,485
They won't listen to me.
The grey, old men?

84
00:08:54,565 --> 00:08:56,085
The men with moustaches? They hate me.

85
00:08:56,165 --> 00:08:58,165
[cheering]

86
00:09:01,245 --> 00:09:03,565
- They do not hate you.
- They do.

87
00:09:04,525 --> 00:09:06,165
They treat me as an outsider.

88
00:09:07,365 --> 00:09:10,445
An irrelevance. Everyone does.

Total control or nothing at all.
Those are my terms.

All right.

94
00:09:39,165 --> 00:09:42,485
- [laughs]
- But don't go mad.

95
00:09:42,565 --> 00:09:45,725
- What does that mean?
- It means just don't go mad.

96
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,885
It's the Coronation.

a thousand years.

Miss...?

105
00:10:25,885 --> 00:10:28,205
[journalist] You must have been thrilled,
Your Highness.

106
00:10:28,285 --> 00:10:30,565
- Not Your Highness.
- Oh.

107
00:10:30,645 --> 00:10:33,685
- Sore point.
- Just a Duchess.

108
00:10:33,765 --> 00:10:36,565
Not H.R.H. So, "Ma'am."

109
00:10:38,165 --> 00:10:41,485
- Ma'am?
- Or, "Your Grace".

110
00:10:44,165 --> 00:10:46,325
What made you choose
this particular house?

111
00:10:46,405 --> 00:10:48,685
It has a two-acre park,
which gives us privacy.

112
00:10:49,365 --> 00:10:52,325
And its size means the Duke and I
can finally entertain properly

113
00:10:52,405 --> 00:10:54,405
and we very much enjoy entertaining.

114
00:10:54,485 --> 00:10:56,965
The Duchess is so very good at it.

115
00:10:57,045 --> 00:10:59,285
I believe our editor agreed
as part of the deal

116
00:10:59,365 --> 00:11:02,365
that you would give our readers
some tips for entertaining?

117
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:06,885
- Did we agree that?
- We did, darling, yes. They paid extra.

118
00:11:07,805 --> 00:11:08,645
Hmm.

119
00:11:08,725 --> 00:11:10,765
Okay. Big smiles.

120
00:11:12,325 --> 00:11:13,325
Perfect.

121
00:11:14,485 --> 00:11:17,125
[David] But having had a naval background,

122
00:11:17,205 --> 00:11:20,365
I don't much care
for fussy things or smells,

123
00:11:20,445 --> 00:11:24,205
but I do like a good, well-milled soap.

124
00:11:28,165 --> 00:11:31,525
What sartorial tips
would you give the young men of today?

125
00:11:31,605 --> 00:11:35,965
No matter what the fashion,
a well-cut suit in a beautiful fabric

126
00:11:36,045 --> 00:11:37,725
will take you anywhere.

127
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:41,965
Is that the sort of thing
you're looking for?

128
00:11:46,925 --> 00:11:48,805
You're very fortunate.

129
00:11:48,885 --> 00:11:53,445
He lets no one in here,
it's his private room. Full of secrets.

130
00:11:53,525 --> 00:11:56,965
Not secrets, darling.
Memories, precious memories.

131
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:03,125
I come in here
for a few moments every day

132
00:12:03,205 --> 00:12:08,005
to meditate and remember.

133
00:12:08,085 --> 00:12:13,285
- Goodness. Bagpipes, too?
- Yes, I play.

134
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:14,965
When he gets homesick.

135
00:12:16,845 --> 00:12:20,085
My favourite armchair.

136
00:12:20,165 --> 00:12:22,565
- And the briefcase?
- Box.

137
00:12:24,205 --> 00:12:29,765
As Monarch, one receives a daily red box
from the government.

138
00:12:30,725 --> 00:12:36,405
State papers, business of the day.
Matters requiring royal assent.

139
00:12:36,485 --> 00:12:43,245
That was the final box I received as King.
It contained my abdication papers.

140
00:12:44,845 --> 00:12:49,165
And all these photographs of you as King,
there are none with the crown.

141
00:12:49,245 --> 00:12:52,565
- Why is that?
- Well, I never made it that far.

142
00:12:58,685 --> 00:13:01,045
I never had a coronation.

143
00:13:07,045 --> 00:13:12,165
I forgot to mention,
I had a call today from Sir John Weir.

144
00:13:13,045 --> 00:13:16,165
- [Wallis] Who?
- My mother's doctor.

145
00:13:17,565 --> 00:13:22,605
Telling me that, in his opinion,
she was in her final days now,

146
00:13:23,885 --> 00:13:26,005
and my sister and I
should make our way over.

147
00:13:27,405 --> 00:13:28,525
With me?

148
00:13:32,165 --> 00:13:33,205
Probably best without.

149
00:13:39,005 --> 00:13:40,565
Even if she dies?

150
00:13:42,685 --> 00:13:44,165
Let's hope she does.

151
00:13:46,285 --> 00:13:47,965
Couldn't bear to go over twice.

152
00:13:49,365 --> 00:13:51,565
I shall have to be brave.

153
00:13:54,085 --> 00:13:55,845
My darling one.

154
00:14:01,845 --> 00:14:02,885
And go without you.

155
00:14:04,445 --> 00:14:06,165
To cold London.

156
00:14:08,405 --> 00:14:09,765
Brutal London.

157
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,725
Hellish London.

158
00:14:26,405 --> 00:14:27,885
Shall we fuck?

159
00:14:33,245 --> 00:14:35,245

<i>the Marshall of the Diplomatic Corp
and the Comptroller, Your Majesty.</i>

162
00:14:52,005 --> 00:14:54,725
I have asked you to join me
because I have made a decision

163
00:14:54,805 --> 00:14:56,565
regarding the Coronation Committee,

164
00:14:57,325 --> 00:15:01,205
which is that I would like my husband
to be the Chairman of that Committee.

165
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:11,165
That's impossible, ma'am.
There can only be one Chairman.

166
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:14,485
As far as I'm aware,
I only have one husband.

167
00:15:14,565 --> 00:15:17,445
And the Duke of Norfolk
will be expecting it to be him.

168
00:15:17,525 --> 00:15:20,165
- He is the Earl Marshall.
- That may be.

169
00:15:20,245 --> 00:15:22,165
And the Chief Butler of England,

170
00:15:22,245 --> 00:15:25,765
he would be the 16th Duke of Norfolk
to do it.

171
00:15:25,845 --> 00:15:31,285
He ran your father's coronation,
his father ran your grandfather's.

172
00:15:31,365 --> 00:15:35,205
And running the coronation,
it's what the Norfolks do.

173
00:15:37,885 --> 00:15:41,605
- Couldn't you give Philip some other job?
- Like what?

174
00:15:44,725 --> 00:15:46,365
Arrange the photographer?

175
00:15:50,805 --> 00:15:55,445
The chairmanship is what he wants.
With full autonomy.

176
00:15:55,525 --> 00:15:57,045
Therefore, it is what I want.

177
00:15:58,645 --> 00:16:02,565
- Norfolk can be vice-chair.
- Why don't you think about it?

178
00:16:02,645 --> 00:16:06,485
I have, and my decision stands.

179
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:07,565
Thank you.

180
00:16:13,565 --> 00:16:16,205
[Lascelles] Of course,
the Duke of Norfolk will be furious.

181
00:16:16,285 --> 00:16:20,285
[Queen Mother] Yes,
and Bernard does fury so well.

182
00:16:20,365 --> 00:16:22,765
What would Your Majesty suggest?

183
00:16:23,725 --> 00:16:28,245
I will throw my hat in with Bernard
and sanity will prevail.

184
00:16:28,325 --> 00:16:29,565
The Queen is young.

185
00:16:30,885 --> 00:16:33,965
And has to learn
what any young general has to learn.

186
00:16:34,045 --> 00:16:35,045
Namely?

187
00:16:36,165 --> 00:16:38,965
Which battles to fight and which to leave.

188
00:16:40,685 --> 00:16:44,765
- Let me know what you want me to do.
- The same as always, Tommy.

189
00:16:46,245 --> 00:16:47,765
Exactly as I tell you.

190
00:16:49,645 --> 00:16:53,205
Now, I've spoken
to the Archbishop of Canterbury

191
00:16:53,285 --> 00:16:57,525
who's agreed to help us
with our other delicate matter.

192
00:16:57,605 --> 00:16:59,085
The Duke of Windsor.

193
00:17:00,445 --> 00:17:02,565
- When does he arrive?
- This afternoon, I believe.

194
00:17:02,645 --> 00:17:03,765
God help us.

195
00:17:04,925 --> 00:17:08,565
- And when will you meet him?
- We thought tomorrow, ma'am.

196
00:17:10,085 --> 00:17:12,285
Good. Sooner the better.

197
00:17:13,405 --> 00:17:16,405
- Be sure to be firm, Tommy.
- Yes, ma'am.

198
00:17:16,485 --> 00:17:19,805
That one's like mercury.
He'll slip through the tiniest crack.

199
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,125
[reporters clamour]

200
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:28,245
[David] <i>Good afternoon.</i>

201
00:17:28,325 --> 00:17:33,725
<i>I have returned to London
to visit my mother, Queen Mary,</i>

202
00:17:33,805 --> 00:17:39,405
who I'm delighted to say has made
such good improvement in recent days.

203
00:17:39,965 --> 00:17:41,125
Thank you very much.

204
00:17:59,325 --> 00:18:01,085
[David] <i>My dearest, darling one...</i>

205
00:18:02,205 --> 00:18:05,285
<i>London is as awful and hellish</i>

206
00:18:05,365 --> 00:18:09,165
<i>and as full of my smug,
stinking relations as ever.</i>

207
00:18:10,405 --> 00:18:13,645
<i>Each day I call on Mama in the afternoon,</i>

208
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:17,845
<i>and although she doesn't look quite
as bad as the doctors warned me,</i>

209
00:18:17,925 --> 00:18:20,805
<i>she'll never again
be able to leave her rooms,</i>

210
00:18:20,885 --> 00:18:22,685
<i>far less go out in public.</i>

211
00:18:24,285 --> 00:18:25,885
[Queen Mary muttering]

212
00:18:40,445 --> 00:18:41,445
What?

213
00:18:44,325 --> 00:18:45,685
Don't go.

214
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,845
Not going anywhere, Mummy.

215
00:18:54,365 --> 00:18:55,365
Good.

216
00:18:55,445 --> 00:18:58,285
[David] <i>It's one of the hardest things
I've ever had to endure.</i>

217
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:02,565
<i>Spending so much time with a woman
who has been so vicious</i>

218
00:19:02,645 --> 00:19:06,485
<i>and inhumane to you, my beloved,
is wearing me down.</i>

219
00:19:06,565 --> 00:19:08,765
- [knocking on door]
- Come in.

220
00:19:14,245 --> 00:19:17,845
- Sorry to disturb, Your Royal Highness.
- What is it?

221
00:19:17,925 --> 00:19:20,965
The Archbishop of Canterbury's
private secretary called, sir.

222
00:19:21,045 --> 00:19:23,765
Requesting a meeting
between you and His Grace.

223
00:19:23,845 --> 00:19:25,445
Oh? What about?

224
00:19:25,525 --> 00:19:28,925
Didn't say, sir.
He hoped you could make tomorrow.

225
00:19:30,205 --> 00:19:35,045
Fine, I have a few errands planned,
but the Archbishop can come to lunch.

226
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:38,445
As a matter of fact,
they suggested 4 p.m.

227
00:19:38,525 --> 00:19:43,165
- Well, alright. We'll give him tea.
- At Lambeth Palace.

228
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:47,165
Of course.

229
00:19:49,005 --> 00:19:52,685
Now I'm no longer King, I go to them.

230
00:19:56,165 --> 00:19:59,565
- Thank you.
- Good night, Your Royal Highness.

231
00:20:11,565 --> 00:20:13,565
[choirboys shout playfully]

232
00:20:33,925 --> 00:20:36,845
His Royal Highness,
the Duke of Windsor, Your Grace.

233
00:20:38,565 --> 00:20:40,005
[David] Goodness. What is this?

234
00:20:40,965 --> 00:20:43,285
- An ambush?
- [Archbishop] Not at all, sir.

235
00:20:43,365 --> 00:20:46,765
No, just a gathering of old friends
who have come together

236
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:50,325
to appeal to you in person,

237
00:20:50,405 --> 00:20:56,365
in the hope that you will do
what we all think... would be...

238
00:20:58,365 --> 00:20:59,365
The right thing.

239
00:21:01,925 --> 00:21:05,045
- Regarding what?
- The coronation.

240
00:21:08,245 --> 00:21:09,685
What about the coronation?

241
00:21:13,925 --> 00:21:15,165
We acknowledge...

242
00:21:16,445 --> 00:21:17,445
as a...

243
00:21:18,685 --> 00:21:24,285
as a member of the Queen's close family,
you are entitled to attend,

244
00:21:24,365 --> 00:21:31,285
but also feel that the attendance
at this sacred ceremony

245
00:21:31,365 --> 00:21:34,365
by one who, however good his reasons,

246
00:21:34,445 --> 00:21:40,565
did not feel... capable of undertaking

247
00:21:40,645 --> 00:21:42,965
the obligations himself...

248
00:21:44,925 --> 00:21:50,765
It could strike a wrong note
and would be deeply upsetting.

249
00:21:50,845 --> 00:21:52,165
To whom?

250
00:21:52,245 --> 00:21:55,085
- [Lascelles] To everyone concerned.
- I didn't ask you, Tommy.

251
00:21:56,245 --> 00:22:00,645
This is Cookie's work, isn't it?
The Queen Mother's?

252
00:22:00,725 --> 00:22:03,325
It's got her pudgy little fingers
all over it.

253
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:08,485
She asked you to do her dirty work for her
and you agreed, Archbishop, shame on you.

254
00:22:08,565 --> 00:22:12,685
I will attend if I want.
And I do want and so does my wife.

255
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:15,045
Alas, no, sir.

256
00:22:15,725 --> 00:22:19,645
Of course the Royal Family is obliged
to extend an invitation to you,

257
00:22:19,725 --> 00:22:20,765
as a Royal Duke.

258
00:22:20,845 --> 00:22:24,725
But that obligation does not extend
to the Duchess of Windsor.

259
00:22:24,805 --> 00:22:28,525
And it is my duty to inform you
on behalf of the Royal Family

260
00:22:28,605 --> 00:22:32,485
and the government, with whom
we have worked in close consultation,

261
00:22:32,565 --> 00:22:36,525
that she will not be offered
an invitation.

262
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,045
Oh, that's madness.

263
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:45,925
The pusillanimity and vindictiveness
knows no limits.

264
00:22:46,005 --> 00:22:50,085
Seventeen years have elapsed
since the abdication.

265
00:22:52,565 --> 00:22:54,325
Shouldn't bygones be bygones?

266
00:22:54,405 --> 00:22:56,525
[Lascelles]
Some things can never be forgotten.

267
00:22:57,045 --> 00:22:59,405
Which of us, for example,
has forgotten the Somme?

268
00:22:59,485 --> 00:23:04,405
You would compare the love
and public commitment I made to my wife

269
00:23:04,485 --> 00:23:06,965
to slaughter in a world war?

270
00:23:25,165 --> 00:23:31,245
Why not use a celebration such as this,

271
00:23:31,325 --> 00:23:34,965
the investiture of a new sovereign,
a beautiful young child,

272
00:23:35,045 --> 00:23:39,845
symbol of modernity, change and progress,
to turn a page?

273
00:23:41,965 --> 00:23:44,245
Surely the sophistication of a society

274
00:23:44,325 --> 00:23:47,765
can be measured by its tolerance
and ability to forgive.

275
00:23:47,845 --> 00:23:52,845
Its weakness, too.
Sometimes lines just need to be drawn.

276
00:23:52,925 --> 00:23:56,565
You know, Tommy, you're an embarrassment
to the institution you serve,

277
00:23:56,645 --> 00:23:59,925
and to the country
that institution serves in turn.

278
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:03,885
And I will take a lecture on national
embarrassment from many people, sir,

279
00:24:03,965 --> 00:24:05,765
but not from you.

280
00:24:06,805 --> 00:24:10,085
Let's face it,
this whole thing is a charade.

281
00:24:10,165 --> 00:24:13,245
You knew already the answer to the choice
you have given me.

282
00:24:13,325 --> 00:24:15,845
It is simply the same as the choice
that caused all this offense

283
00:24:15,925 --> 00:24:17,005
in the first place.

284
00:24:17,085 --> 00:24:22,325
Namely, would I do anything that excludes
or disrespects the woman I love?

285
00:24:22,405 --> 00:24:26,285
No, never. I will therefore
not be attending the coronation

286
00:24:26,365 --> 00:24:28,605
of my own niece.

287
00:24:28,685 --> 00:24:30,925
Whose favourite uncle I have always been.

288
00:24:31,005 --> 00:24:34,005
Hers, you should know,
was one of the strongest voices involved.

289
00:24:34,085 --> 00:24:35,565
Oh, was it indeed?

290
00:24:35,645 --> 00:24:38,365
Well, we know from where
she gets that ice in her veins.

291
00:24:38,445 --> 00:24:40,925
And it wasn't from my own dear,
weak brother.

292
00:24:41,005 --> 00:24:43,805
[Lascelles] Nothing weak
about the late King, sir.

293
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:47,525
I'm sure I speak for everyone present
when I call him a hero.

294
00:24:47,605 --> 00:24:48,805
Hear, hear.

295
00:24:51,965 --> 00:24:54,565
"My Lord, Archbishop,

296
00:24:54,645 --> 00:24:57,325
what a scold you are.

297
00:24:57,405 --> 00:25:00,725
And when your man is down,
how very bold you are.

298
00:25:00,805 --> 00:25:07,805
Of Christian charity, how very scant
you are, you Auld Lang Swine,

299
00:25:08,565 --> 00:25:11,405
- how full of cant you are."
- [protests]

300
00:25:11,485 --> 00:25:17,925
A rhyme composed for your perfidious
predecessor at the time of my abdication.

301
00:25:18,005 --> 00:25:21,805
I find the sentiment
oddly applicable to you, too.

302
00:25:36,565 --> 00:25:42,125
If I were to release a statement,
could you have a look over it?

303
00:25:42,205 --> 00:25:43,245
Of course, sir.

304
00:25:46,725 --> 00:25:49,645
I'm aware that it's normal
for no reigning monarchs

305
00:25:49,725 --> 00:25:53,605
to be present at a coronation.

306
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:58,405
Perhaps we could extend that
to include former kings too.

307
00:25:58,485 --> 00:26:00,285
To spare my blushes.

308
00:26:00,365 --> 00:26:03,485
Might just throw
some of the vultures off the scent.

309
00:26:07,765 --> 00:26:09,965
It's an elegant solution, sir.

310
00:26:10,045 --> 00:26:13,765
And I'm quite sure Cabinet
will support it. Tommy?

311
00:26:15,405 --> 00:26:17,365
I'll speak to Their Majesties
and get back to you.

312
00:26:26,725 --> 00:26:28,845
We've just had a call
from Marlborough House.

313
00:26:29,805 --> 00:26:32,605
Regarding her Majesty, Queen Mary.

314
00:26:39,085 --> 00:26:41,165
[David] <i>My own darling sweetheart.</i>

315
00:26:42,485 --> 00:26:44,245
<i>Well, at last it's all over.</i>

316
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:47,765
<i>Mama took ill in the afternoon,</i>

317
00:26:47,845 --> 00:26:50,285
<i>then began haemorrhaging
in the early hours.</i>

318
00:26:51,285 --> 00:26:54,445
<i>Doctors plied her
with tranquilizers and morphine</i>

319
00:26:54,525 --> 00:26:57,165
<i>to ensure there was no suffering.</i>

320
00:26:57,245 --> 00:26:59,485
<i>In the end, she passed in her sleep.</i>

321
00:27:00,925 --> 00:27:02,085
<i>I was sad, of course,</i>

322
00:27:02,165 --> 00:27:06,565
<i>but let's not forget
how she clung to such hatred for me,</i>

323
00:27:06,645 --> 00:27:09,045
<i>her eldest, till the last.</i>

324
00:27:10,485 --> 00:27:14,525
<i>I'm afraid her blood ran as icy cold
when she was alive</i>

325
00:27:14,605 --> 00:27:16,725
<i>as it does now she's dead.</i>

326
00:27:18,925 --> 00:27:21,965
<i>Later in the day,
all the members of the family assembled</i>

327
00:27:22,045 --> 00:27:25,565
<i>to identify which of her personal
possessions they would most like.</i>

328
00:27:25,645 --> 00:27:26,965
Not entirely.

329
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:30,805
<i>I told Shirley Temple
what I had my eye on.</i>

330
00:27:30,885 --> 00:27:33,405
<i>Because I shan't be there
when the jackals descend</i>

331
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,485
<i>I don't suppose it will do much good.</i>

332
00:27:36,725 --> 00:27:41,045
<i>What a vile, tawdry rabble
my relatives are</i>

333
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:45,805
<i>and what a sad, desiccated bunch of
hyenas most of them have become.</i>

334
00:27:48,925 --> 00:27:51,045
<i>But I'm tired of talking about it.</i>

335
00:27:52,165 --> 00:27:55,525
<i>I yearn for our perfect life together,</i>

336
00:27:55,605 --> 00:27:58,645
<i>away from the snarling
and the sniping of the Court.</i>

337
00:27:59,885 --> 00:28:02,445
<i>I adore you, my sweetheart,</i>

338
00:28:02,525 --> 00:28:05,765
<i>more deeply than you will ever realize,</i>

339
00:28:05,845 --> 00:28:08,445
<i>and I am furiously mad
that you aren't here with me</i>

340
00:28:08,525 --> 00:28:10,845
<i>as you ought by right to be.</i>

341
00:28:15,845 --> 00:28:17,565
[Archbishop] While Queen Mary lived,

342
00:28:17,645 --> 00:28:23,285
something of the great reigns
of Queen Victoria and George V

343
00:28:23,365 --> 00:28:26,885
seemed to live on with her.

344
00:28:26,965 --> 00:28:32,885
Proving that character is,
as it will remain,

345
00:28:32,965 --> 00:28:35,645
the essential strength
of British Monarchy.

346
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:41,205
Wherever she went,
she was assured of an applause

347
00:28:41,285 --> 00:28:47,205
which sprang from some
deep-seated affection and respect.

348
00:28:47,285 --> 00:28:51,125
Have you noticed?
Identical to the funeral of your father.

349
00:28:51,205 --> 00:28:53,685
Nothing different. Not one detail.

350
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:54,965
Not one guest.

351
00:28:57,365 --> 00:29:00,485
And she always regarded herself

352
00:29:00,565 --> 00:29:06,565
as a servant of our country,
which she served to the end.

353
00:29:07,285 --> 00:29:10,485
No sooner does someone in the family
pop their clogs, they ask themselves:

354
00:29:10,565 --> 00:29:11,885
"Right. How was it done last time?

355
00:29:11,965 --> 00:29:14,405
Then let's do it
exactly the same way again." I mean...

356
00:29:16,285 --> 00:29:21,365
Meanwhile, the people who have come
to share in it are locked outside.

357
00:29:22,645 --> 00:29:24,605
I'm not going to let your coronation
be like this.

358
00:29:24,685 --> 00:29:27,565
You're a young woman. Symbol of a new era.

359
00:29:27,645 --> 00:29:32,125
In a fast-changing, modern world.

360
00:29:35,285 --> 00:29:37,885
And I think your coronation
should reflect that.

361
00:29:39,685 --> 00:29:42,085
- [whispers] Sorry.
- ...Almighty God of his great mercy.

362
00:29:42,165 --> 00:29:43,245
Sorry, darling.

363
00:29:53,725 --> 00:30:00,045
[Archbishop] Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

364
00:30:00,805 --> 00:30:06,165
In sure and certain hope
of the resurrection to eternal life

365
00:30:06,245 --> 00:30:11,325
through our Lord Jesus Christ,
who changed our vile body

366
00:30:11,405 --> 00:30:14,605
that it may be like
unto his glorious body...

367
00:30:22,525 --> 00:30:23,805
Ladies and gentlemen...

368
00:30:24,965 --> 00:30:26,965
[muttering]

369
00:30:42,245 --> 00:30:43,285
[knocking on door]

370
00:30:47,525 --> 00:30:48,565
We should go.

371
00:31:03,965 --> 00:31:05,045
Good morning.

372
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:09,325
Head's up.

373
00:31:10,845 --> 00:31:15,365
What is the collective noun
for a group of stuffy old Etonians?

374
00:31:17,725 --> 00:31:20,165
A herd? A pack?

375
00:31:21,685 --> 00:31:22,725
A school? [chuckles]

376
00:31:42,685 --> 00:31:43,685
Thank you.

377
00:31:48,685 --> 00:31:50,205
Gentlemen,

378
00:31:51,245 --> 00:31:53,765
I'd like to start by saying
how very honoured I feel

379
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:58,285
to be working with all the great minds
and talents here in this room today

380
00:31:58,365 --> 00:32:03,285
as we come together to organize
the very best coronation for my wife,

381
00:32:03,365 --> 00:32:04,365
the Queen.

382
00:32:06,565 --> 00:32:09,285
We all know the scale of the challenge
that faces us.

383
00:32:10,085 --> 00:32:13,085
The eyes of the world will be on us,
Britain will be on show

384
00:32:13,165 --> 00:32:16,765
and we must put our best foot forward.

385
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:21,965
In such circumstances, the temptation

386
00:32:22,045 --> 00:32:24,725
is to roll out the red carpet
and follow the precedents

387
00:32:24,805 --> 00:32:29,885
set by the grand
and successful coronations of the past.

388
00:32:29,965 --> 00:32:33,525
But looking to the past
for our inspiration

389
00:32:33,605 --> 00:32:35,525
would be a mistake in my view.

390
00:32:37,005 --> 00:32:39,925
Britain today
is not the Britain of past coronations.

391
00:32:40,005 --> 00:32:43,045
Assumptions made at the time
of my father-in-law's coronation

392
00:32:43,125 --> 00:32:46,365
17 years ago cannot be made anymore.

393
00:32:47,925 --> 00:32:51,325
That is why I think
we should adapt this ceremony.

394
00:32:53,485 --> 00:32:57,125
Make it less ostentatious.
More egalitarian.

395
00:32:57,205 --> 00:33:00,325
Show more respect
and sensitivity to the real world.

396
00:33:00,405 --> 00:33:03,845
We have a new sovereign,
young and a woman.

397
00:33:03,925 --> 00:33:08,485
Let us give her
a coronation that is befitting

398
00:33:08,565 --> 00:33:11,045
of the wind of change that she represents,

399
00:33:11,125 --> 00:33:14,805
modern and forward-looking
at a moment in time

400
00:33:14,885 --> 00:33:16,965
where exciting technological developments

401
00:33:17,045 --> 00:33:19,805
are making things possible
we never dreamt of.

402
00:33:19,885 --> 00:33:21,925
Which brings me to my next point...

403
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:38,045
It's an unconscionable vulgarization.

404
00:33:42,725 --> 00:33:46,325
How close are you proposing
that these cameras get?

405
00:33:46,405 --> 00:33:48,925
They will be kept
at a very discreet distance.

406
00:33:49,005 --> 00:33:50,965
No, no close-ups, sir?

407
00:33:53,605 --> 00:33:55,165
Zoom lenses.

408
00:33:55,245 --> 00:33:58,445
Oh, no, it will all be done
with the greatest sensitivity

409
00:33:58,525 --> 00:34:01,445
and respect for the occasion.

410
00:34:10,005 --> 00:34:15,285
But I have had one or two broader thoughts
about the service itself.

411
00:34:19,805 --> 00:34:20,645
What?

412
00:34:35,445 --> 00:34:37,245
We can both see what's going on here.

413
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,245
A young couple are playing marital games

414
00:34:39,325 --> 00:34:42,685
with the most cherished parts
of our history and pageantry.

415
00:34:44,085 --> 00:34:48,125
Our Queen wouldn't agree with a single one
of these radical proposals,

416
00:34:48,205 --> 00:34:50,485
television being just the tip
of the iceberg.

417
00:34:54,085 --> 00:34:57,325
She's simply trying to keep peace
in her own bed chamber

418
00:34:57,405 --> 00:35:00,445
by promoting her husband
and keeping him happy and occupied

419
00:35:00,525 --> 00:35:02,005
and virile.

420
00:35:04,805 --> 00:35:09,885
- That's what's going on here, Winston.
- Why? What else has he proposed?

421
00:35:14,685 --> 00:35:16,725
- Prime Minister.
- Your Majesty.

422
00:35:35,165 --> 00:35:37,365
Please tell me this has nothing to do
with my husband.

423
00:35:39,205 --> 00:35:40,725
I told him not to go mad.

424
00:35:43,325 --> 00:35:46,885
No one is questioning
the Duke of Edinburgh's motives

425
00:35:46,965 --> 00:35:49,485
or the sincerity of his beliefs.

426
00:35:49,565 --> 00:35:52,005
I see. He went mad.

427
00:35:53,245 --> 00:35:58,405
The changes he is proposing
to an ancient, sacred,

428
00:35:58,485 --> 00:36:02,005
never previously changed
liturgy and text...

429
00:36:04,725 --> 00:36:06,965
It went from top to toe.

430
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:11,405
And if it were just a business,
it would be applauded.

431
00:36:11,485 --> 00:36:14,285
But this isn't a business. It's the Crown.

432
00:36:17,165 --> 00:36:18,965
And one has to ask oneself...

433
00:36:19,045 --> 00:36:25,125
What is the purpose of the Crown?
What is the purpose of the monarchy?

434
00:36:25,205 --> 00:36:27,005
Does the Crown bend
to the will of the people

435
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:30,045
to be audited and accountable?

436
00:36:30,125 --> 00:36:34,645
Or should it remain
above temporal matters?

437
00:36:39,045 --> 00:36:40,525
What say you?

438
00:36:44,205 --> 00:36:49,285
No, ma'am. What say you?

439
00:36:49,365 --> 00:36:51,765
The decision is yours to make.

440
00:36:52,965 --> 00:36:56,525
We will take our lead from you.

441
00:37:37,365 --> 00:37:40,965
We just wondered if you might be available
for a brief moment in the vestry.

442
00:37:43,645 --> 00:37:44,645
Alright.

443
00:37:54,805 --> 00:37:57,765
- What is this? Hide and seek?
- I told you not to overstep the mark.

444
00:37:57,845 --> 00:37:59,845
I made it clear,
carte blanche or nothing at all.

445
00:37:59,925 --> 00:38:02,765
Trade Unionists and businessmen?
In the Abbey?

446
00:38:02,845 --> 00:38:06,725
- If you want to stay on the throne, yes.
- In a trimmed-down televised coronation?

447
00:38:06,805 --> 00:38:09,605
If you want to avoid a revolution, yes.
You forget.

448
00:38:09,685 --> 00:38:12,965
I have seen first-hand what it is like
for a royal family to be overthrown

449
00:38:13,045 --> 00:38:14,845
because they were out of step
with the people.

450
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:18,085
I left Greece in an orange crate.
My father would have been killed.

451
00:38:18,165 --> 00:38:21,165
My grandfather was.
I'm just trying to protect you.

452
00:38:21,245 --> 00:38:23,325
From whom? The British people?

453
00:38:23,405 --> 00:38:25,525
You have no idea who they are
or what they want.

454
00:38:25,605 --> 00:38:30,125
Oh, oh, I'm just Johnny Foreigner, again,
who doesn't understand. Fine, fine.

455
00:38:30,205 --> 00:38:32,445
You want a big overblown ceremony
costing a fortune

456
00:38:32,525 --> 00:38:35,325
while the rest of the country
is on rations, have it.

457
00:38:35,405 --> 00:38:37,285
But don't come bleating to me

458
00:38:37,365 --> 00:38:40,445
when your head and the heads
of our children are on spikes.

459
00:38:40,525 --> 00:38:43,565
If the people are hungry,
they want something that lifts them up.

460
00:38:43,645 --> 00:38:47,885
And how do you propose lifting them
if they cannot see it?

461
00:38:47,965 --> 00:38:50,765
The people look to a monarchy
for something bigger than themselves.

462
00:38:50,845 --> 00:38:52,805
An inspiration. A higher ideal.

463
00:38:52,885 --> 00:38:54,605
If you put it in their homes,

464
00:38:54,685 --> 00:38:56,885
allow them to watch it
with their dinner on their laps.

465
00:38:56,965 --> 00:39:00,525
It will democratize it, make them feel
that they share in it. Understand it.

466
00:39:00,605 --> 00:39:01,805
Alright!

467
00:39:03,485 --> 00:39:06,125
Alright.
I'll support you in the televising.

468
00:39:10,045 --> 00:39:11,405
You won't regret it.

469
00:39:12,645 --> 00:39:13,685
On one condition.

470
00:39:16,925 --> 00:39:18,605
That you kneel.

471
00:39:30,525 --> 00:39:33,965
- Who told you?
- My Prime Minister.

472
00:39:35,445 --> 00:39:37,925
- He said you intended to refuse.
- I merely asked the question.

473
00:39:38,005 --> 00:39:40,725
Whether it was right in this day and age
that the Queen's consort,

474
00:39:40,805 --> 00:39:45,365
her husband, should kneel to her
rather than stand beside her.

475
00:39:45,445 --> 00:39:47,605
You won't be kneeling to me.

476
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:49,885
That's not how it will look.
That's not how it will feel.

477
00:39:49,965 --> 00:39:52,765
It will feel like a eunuch,
an amoeba, is kneeling before his wife.

478
00:39:52,845 --> 00:39:55,685
You'll be kneeling before God
and the Crown as we all do.

479
00:39:55,765 --> 00:39:57,325
I don't see you kneeling before anyone.

480
00:39:57,405 --> 00:39:59,885
Because I'm already flattened
under the weight of this thing.

481
00:39:59,965 --> 00:40:02,645
Oh, spare me the false humility.
Doesn't look like that to me.

482
00:40:02,725 --> 00:40:05,205
- How does it look to you?
- Looks to me like you're enjoying it.

483
00:40:05,285 --> 00:40:08,205
It's released an unattractive sense
of authority and entitlement

484
00:40:08,285 --> 00:40:09,605
that I have never seen before.

485
00:40:09,685 --> 00:40:12,605
In you, it's released a weakness
and insecurity I've never seen before.

486
00:40:12,685 --> 00:40:15,325
- Are you my wife or my Queen?
- I'm both.

487
00:40:15,405 --> 00:40:17,525
I want to be married to my wife.

488
00:40:17,605 --> 00:40:20,125
I am both and a strong man
would be able to kneel to both.

489
00:40:20,205 --> 00:40:22,725
- I will not kneel before my wife.
- Your wife is not asking you to.

490
00:40:22,805 --> 00:40:24,165
- But my Queen commands me?
- Yes.

491
00:40:24,245 --> 00:40:26,245
I beg you make an exception for me.

492
00:40:31,285 --> 00:40:32,805
No.

493
00:41:20,405 --> 00:41:23,045
Come on, they'll be here soon!

494
00:41:26,725 --> 00:41:30,845
[Wallis] David, you're our host, darling.

495
00:41:32,805 --> 00:41:33,925
Be right there.

496
00:41:36,885 --> 00:41:39,885
[in French] <i>For the sixth time
in the history of England,</i>

497
00:41:39,965 --> 00:41:44,485
<i>a Queen receives the crown.
A big day for the British public</i>

498
00:41:44,565 --> 00:41:47,045
<i>who are living these beautiful hours
after the end of the war.</i>

499
00:41:47,125 --> 00:41:51,365
<i>Leaving Buckingham Palace, the historical
carousel carrying the Queen and the Duke,</i>

500
00:41:51,445 --> 00:41:53,845
<i>is travelling towards
Westminster Abbey...</i>

501
00:41:53,925 --> 00:42:00,925
[David] Alright, everyone. She's arriving.
In the dreaded Gold State Coach.

502
00:42:01,005 --> 00:42:06,485
Made in the 1760s and the most
uncomfortable ride known to man.

503
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:08,565
[laughter]

504
00:42:12,445 --> 00:42:14,325
[producer] Final checks, please,
gentlemen.

505
00:42:14,405 --> 00:42:17,365
- West door.
- West door, sir.
