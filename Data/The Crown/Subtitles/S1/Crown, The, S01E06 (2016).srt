1
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,460
More than half a million people
pack Epsom to bursting point.

2
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:41,820
And now, to watch the coronation derby
comes Her Majesty The Queen.

3
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,520
Her car bearing the royal standard

4
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,600
moves slowly down the course
from Tatnum Corner.

5
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,100
Accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh,

6
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:53,180
the Queen waves acknowledgement
to the welcoming cheers.

7
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,900
The crowds pour their appreciation
for the dashing handsome couple,

8
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,500
a symbol of a new era.

9
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,900
Half a million people.

10
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,020
At a racecourse.

11
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:16,740
Thanks to the coronation, your sister
is now the most famous woman in the world.

12
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,800
Yes.

13
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,220
But I'm the luckiest.

14
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,680
-And on our romantic trip to Rhodesia...
-Official duty in Rhodesia.

15
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,240
-With the man I love.
-Secretly love.

16
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,320
I will be the happiest.

17
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,900
I've got a story, chief. It's important.

18
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,200
As long as it's not about
the Royal family, Bill, I'm all ears.

19
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,120
It is about the Royal family, chief.

20
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,560
Let me guess, how thanks
to one beautiful young woman,

21
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,100
one short televised ceremony...

22
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,380
Oh, thank you, Bob.

23
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,780
A tired anachronistic institution
has rejuvenated,

24
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:16,020
a nation is liberated from the austerity
of rationing and war,

25
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,580
our place as a leading power
in the world has re-established

26
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,120
just when it seemed to be slipping.
What a load of bollocks.

27
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,800
-Snifter?
-I shouldn't.

28
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,560
-Oh, go on. It's nearly lunchtime.
-Papers, sir.

29
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,000
-Thanks, Mary.
-My job.

30
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,760
-It's Princess Margaret.
-What about her?

31
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,380
Leaving the Abbey
on the day of the coronation,

32
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,860
I saw her picking a piece of fluff
off a man's uniform.

33
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,860
-Fluff?
-Yes. Fluff.

34
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,300
Jesus, Bill, I thought
we did serious reporting here.

35
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,620
This is serious

36
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,780
because the man in question,
her father's former equerry,

37
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,840
Group Captain Peter Townsend,
is a commoner,

38
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,080
and wait for it, a divorced commoner.

39
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,520
Historically,
when this lot brush up against divorce

40
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,440
you end up with either
reformation or abdication.

41
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,220
Will church and state clash again?
It's a big story.

42
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,100
So are comet jet planes
dropping out of the sky,

43
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,860
Stalin's death ushering
in a power reshuffle in the Soviet Union.

44
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,720
Let me write it up, chief.
I've got a feeling about this one.

45
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,880
Based on what?

46
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,520
What are you doing, man?

47
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:26,180
Picking fluff off a man's jacket
that's a gesture as intimate as a kiss,

48
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,420
more intimate, since it suggests
the kiss has already happened.

49
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:34,300
No. I'm sorry, Bill. I can't hold
the front page for a bit of fluff.

50
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,600
Let me write it, chief. Then you decide.

51
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,720
All right.

52
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,280
Make sure it's peppery.

53
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,460
-Make sure it pops.
-Yes, sir!

54
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,400
Switchboard.
Good morning, Your Royal Highness.

55
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,580
Good morning. I would like
to speak to my sister, please.

56
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,360
One moment, please.

57
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,000
-London.
-Buckingham Palace, please.

58
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:37,040
-Victoria 48, 32.
-Hold the line.

59
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,000
Buckingham Palace, good morning.

60
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,320
Go ahead, please.

61
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,180
I have Her Royal Highness
the Princess Margaret for Her Majesty.

62
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,500
-Certainly, sir.
-Thank you.

63
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,700
Can you hold the line?

64
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:53,620
-Sir, Princess Margaret for Her Majesty.
-Thank you.

65
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,720
Hello?

66
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,360
I have Her Royal Highness
the Princess Margaret for Her Majesty.

67
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,320
Yes, sir, breakfast room.

68
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,460
-Breakfast room
-Yes, sir.

69
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,900
Telephone call for you, ma'am.

70
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:35,860
Yes?

71
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:40,380
Her Royal Highness the Princess Margaret,
Your Majesty.

72
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,300
Thank you.

73
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:46,740
-Hello, you.
-Hello, you.

74
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,900
So, I was wondering
if you had a free evening soon

75
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,280
where we all might have dinner together.

76
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,040
-Before I go to Rhodesia.
-I'm sure I do.

77
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,680
-Thursday? Mummy's out.
-I'd have to check.

78
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,780
-Lovely.
-And, who's "us all"?

79
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:06,020
You, and me, and Philip and...

80
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,460
And I'd like to bring Peter if I may.

81
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,260
-What, Peter-Peter?
-Yes, Peter.

82
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,780
Oh.

83
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:19,860
-What does that mean, oh?
-Nothing. Oh, how nice.

84
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,700
There's something
we'd like to discuss with you.

85
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,700
-Oh?
-There you go again.

86
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:30,460
-Sorry. Am I going to be given a clue?
-No.

87
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,340
Oh.

88
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,180
-Stop it.
-Sorry.

89
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,940
-So Thursday evening, then? You'll check?
-Fine.

90
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,660
It will be such fun.

91
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,180
Lovely.

92
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,340
Lovely.

93
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,480
Oh.

94
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,600
Here we are.

95
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,580
-Sir.
-Lovely, thank you.

96
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,140
Sir.

97
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,000
-What's your name then, my darling?
-Thank you, gentlemen, thank you.

98
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,380
Thank you very much, gentlemen,
thank you.

99
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,220
You're too kind, you're too kind.

100
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,380
A special guest joins us this afternoon,

101
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,880
who's just returned from a year
in post-revolutionary Cairo

102
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,320
working as a photojournalist.

103
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,920
Our fellow lunch club member,
Tony Longdon.

104
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,960
All-Night-Longdon.

105
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,720
Thank you, chaps,
it's very nice to be back, I must say.

106
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:02,140
Ladies, might we close the shutters,
please?

107
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,920
Lovely!

108
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,880
I am, as Baron says,
fresh from the streets of Cairo,

109
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,200
and I'm still trying to digest
the hurricane of popular uprising,

110
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,440
violent military coup and revolution
that I have just witnessed.

111
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,000
Bloody natives.

112
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,320
You all know King Farouk.
Colourful character.

113
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,800
- He owned more than a hundred cars.
- Almost as much as me.

114
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,400
-Had them all painted red.
-Splendid.

115
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,940
He used to race them
through streets of Cairo,

116
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:38,700
shooting at any pedestrians
who happen to get in his way.

117
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,680
-Hear, hear.
-Peasant shoot!

118
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,240
Probably why he was forced
to abdicate last year.

119
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:52,800
And now, this man, Nasser,
is the name on everyone's lips.

120
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:56,100
He has the charisma to unite
not just his own country,

121
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,940
but the entire Arab world.

122
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,560
Stirring up anti-Western,
anti-monarchical sentiment.

123
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,480
This is Shepheard's.

124
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:15,300
A famous British hotel.
A symbol of colonial rule.

125
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,540
Before riots...

126
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,460
- God.
- ...and after.

127
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,720
That writing. What does it say?

128
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,360
"Death to the Imperialists."

129
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,680
However, it's not all doom and gloom.

130
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,120
Mike, got something
a little special for you here.

131
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,820
Now, that's what
I'm talking about.

132
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,240
-Give him a tip.
-Don't tell my wife.

133
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,200
Good tip.

134
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,560
-Where were you today?
-Nowhere.

135
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,680
Well, clearly somewhere.
But nowhere that would interest you.

136
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,000
It's a lunch club.

137
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,640
-Where?
-Soho.

138
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,060
Oh.

139
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,220
With just men.

140
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,180
Talking about women.

141
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,060
No.
Talking about Egypt if you must know.

142
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,340
And the revolution
that's just taken place there.

143
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:50,560
Along with the unrest in Croatia, Albania,
Montenegro, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Italy.

144
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,480
Please take note.

145
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,200
Yes, a little bit about the fairer sex
over coffee and the odd brandy.

146
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,980
What do you expect?
It's a gentlemen's lunch club.

147
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,100
-So, what's the guest list for tonight?
-No one.

148
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:21,860
-Just you, me, Margaret and, oh, Peter.
-What? Townsend Peter?

149
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,980
-Why on earth did we have to dress up?
-She insisted.

150
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,140
She wanted to make it a special occasion.

151
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,900
With him?
Isn't that a contradiction in terms?

152
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,000
He's not been a naughty boy, has he?

153
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,720
I know as much as you do.

154
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,040
It will be fine.

155
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,740
Come on.

156
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,020
-We'd like to be left alone now.
-Yes, ma'am.

157
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,860
Just leave it.

158
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,220
Thank you.

159
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,420
Excuse me.

160
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,000
I asked you here tonight because...

161
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,000
there is something
I wanted to discuss with you.

162
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,680
I think you already know
that over the years

163
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,520
with Peter
being so much part of our family,

164
00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:00,320
and away from his own so much,
a friendship has developed between us.

165
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:07,140
And then, ever since Papa's death
hitting me so hard,

166
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:13,700
and with your succession and coronation
and you being more and more occupied,

167
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:19,120
Peter has become almost
my sole companion, and I his.

168
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,520
And so when his divorce came through
in December last year,

169
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:28,140
I suppose it was only natural
that we both started thinking about

170
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,260
what kind of...

171
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,560
future we might have together

172
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,680
and we have reached a decision in April,
wasn't it?

173
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,440
Just before the coronation...

174
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,360
that one day...

175
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,860
we wanted to...

176
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,620
Well, you know...

177
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:01,220
- Marry?
- Yes.

178
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,920
Goodness.

179
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:09,420
Well, of course, we're aware
of the complications and issues at stake.

180
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,660
Oh, Lilibet, you've known for a while
about Peter and I.

181
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,740
This can't really be
a terrible shock to you.

182
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,160
No, not at all.

183
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,840
It's wonderful.

184
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,860
-Is there anything you'd like to ask us?
-Does your wife know?

185
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,060
-No, ex-wife.
-She does. We had a frank conversation.

186
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,660
-There is no animosity.
-Oh, good.

187
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:45,340
-And the boys?
-They know and seem very happy.

188
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,100
So...

189
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,480
do I have your permission?

190
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,680
As Sovereign?

191
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,400
Oh.

192
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,440
Well...

193
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,320
Of course, I'll have to take advice...

194
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,760
on the how's and where's and...

195
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:24,540
all official matters,
but if it's what you desire...

196
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,820
More than anything in the world.

197
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,120
Then as your sister,
I'm never going to oppose it.

198
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,360
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

199
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,480
Thank you. I'm so happy. I'm so happy.

200
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,840
Oh, well. Congratulations, both of you.

201
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,020
Thank you, sir.

202
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,060
I suppose it had better be "Philip"
from now on.

203
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,740
Thank you, sir. Oh, Philip.

204
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,960
You knew?

205
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,080
Not the extent of it.

206
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,580
But you didn't think to mention it?

207
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,780
I don't like it. Any of it.

208
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:20,660
For one thing,
it will create the most enormous scandal.

209
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,820
Nor do I believe in them as a couple.
He's too old for her.

210
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,400
And he had some sort of "breakdown"
during the war.

211
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,120
Now that's all in the past.

212
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,280
Besides, that's why he got on
with my father so well.

213
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,520
-Not to mention the fact he's dull.
-He's not dull.

214
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,680
Desperately dull. I'm confident
I've met more interesting plants.

215
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,380
Not to mention
it's a terrible thing to do to you.

216
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,780
Why?

217
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,000
Because of the position it puts you in
as a sister and as a Queen.

218
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,920
Has everyone forgotten the catastrophe
that was your uncle already?

219
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,560
-The situation's different.
-One party divorced? The other Royal?

220
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,980
Sounds pretty similar to me.

221
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:05,540
That was 17 years ago.
The world has changed.

222
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:09,580
The rest of the world has.
Nothing changes in the Court of St. James.

223
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,320
Besides, we have a son and heir.

224
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,360
There's no realistic prospect
of Margaret becoming queen.

225
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,360
And one can see the attraction.

226
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:30,200
-In Peter?
-Yes. He's a handsome war hero.

227
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:34,740
-Divorced war hero.
-And blameless in that divorce.

228
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,640
No. There's no such thing
as a blameless party in a divorce.

229
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,520
His wife had an affair with another man.

230
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,880
Because he was always around here,
sniffing around your sister.

231
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,820
-He was looking after my father.
-And sniffing around your sister.

232
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,060
Stop it.

233
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,380
Anyway, I thought you liked him.

234
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:00,740
Liked him? I mean, I respect him
for what he did in the war, certainly.

235
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,720
He plays bridge well.
And he's a good pilot.

236
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,080
-And he's a good influence on Margaret.
-Is he?

237
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,920
If he were a good influence
he'd patch things up with his wife,

238
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,520
and leave Margaret well alone.

239
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,240
-Night, Bill.
-Goodnight.

240
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,420
Potentially...

241
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,760
-Goodnight, sir.
-Yeah.

242
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,720
This had better be good.

243
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,200
It is.

244
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,140
-Bloody hell.
-You did say peppery.

245
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,880
-Pepper is one thing. This is gelignite.
-I know.

246
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,000
-What are you doing?
-I can't run this without going upstairs.

247
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,120
-What?
-Don't look at me like that.

248
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,980
Live in the real bloody world
for a moment, will you?

249
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:37,260
Margery, hello, yes. Is he there?
Yeah, just for a few minutes.

250
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:45,060
This is not just inflammatory,
it breaks all the rules.

251
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,180
What rules, sir?

252
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,620
The unspoken rules
of deference and respect

253
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,620
shown by the media to the Royal family.

254
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,180
But surely those rules changed

255
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:56,020
the moment they invited television
into the coronation.

256
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,540
That was their right,
and a huge concession.

257
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,700
-To what?
-Popular interest.

258
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,740
Their interest also.

259
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,760
Look at their standing now,
it's never been higher.

260
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,680
The question we in the fourth estate
need to be asking ourselves is,

261
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,320
do we let ourselves be used,
or do we have our own independent voice?

262
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,740
Don't get moralistic with me.

263
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:19,260
If we don't break this story,
do you think nobody else will?

264
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:22,100
I know there's plenty of others
sniffing around it, sir.

265
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,240
Oh, thank you for letting me know.

266
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,440
Of course, Tommy,
thank you for understanding.

267
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,680
-I'm sorry.
-No, I'm sorry.

268
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,660
I imagine it must be difficult

269
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,500
being dictated to like that
by an employee.

270
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:45,500
-I wasn't dictated to.
-Am I missing something?

271
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,020
You said this editor was telling you

272
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,220
what he was going to print
in your newspaper.

273
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:53,180
He is. But I can't keep telling him
what to write.

274
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,480
I thought that was the point
of owning a newspaper.

275
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,640
Look, I'm just trying to help you, Tommy.

276
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,840
I suggest you see this
for the kind gesture that it is.

277
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,560
What?
That you are about to print an article

278
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,080
that will cause deep distress
to senior, let's be quite clear,

279
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,700
the most senior members
of the Royal family?

280
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:14,300
That I'm warning you.
That I'm giving you the heads up.

281
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,280
I'm on my knees with gratitude.

282
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,520
Stop.

283
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,760
Can you shut that?

284
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,960
Your Majesty.

285
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,960
A story is about to break in the press

286
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:50,460
identifying Peter Townsend not just
as the companion of Princess Margaret...

287
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:56,540
but as her likely future husband.

288
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:02,360
We understand that the paper
is to feature a profile

289
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,160
of Group Captain Townsend,

290
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,800
details of his marriage
and subsequent divorce,

291
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:13,740
along with an editorial
about other notable divorcees

292
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:17,380
to have been associated
with members of the Royal family.

293
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,480
Should we deny it all?

294
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:34,940
With respect, ma'am,
it's a little late for that.

295
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:38,100
This horse has already bolted.

296
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,520
Your Royal Highness?

297
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,620
Her Majesty the Queen for you,
Your Royal Highness.

298
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,780
On the telephone.

299
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:14,180
-Hello.
-Hello, you. Bad time, good time?

300
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,560
Good time. Always.

301
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,080
Look, I've been wracking my brain
about how I can best help you.

302
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,340
Now, you know that the Church of England

303
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,780
doesn't permit the remarriage
of divorced persons

304
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,620
if the husband or wife
of the former marriage is still alive.

305
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,540
Yes.

306
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:34,140
Well, I was just wondering,
if you and Peter had considered Scotland?

307
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:37,060
-To live?
-No, for the wedding.

308
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:40,100
Why?
Because it would be more low profile?

309
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:43,740
Well, actually,
I was thinking of legal reasons.

310
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,040
Marriage isn't regarded as a sacrament
in the Church of Scotland.

311
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:50,140
It is not as binding
in the same way as here.

312
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:55,500
Meaning, meaning we could
even get married in a church?

313
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:58,140
Well, I'd have to check, but I think so.

314
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,300
That would be so lovely.

315
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,600
-Lilibet, thank you so much.
-It would make my life a lot easier too.

316
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:15,100
-Sorry, Lilibet.
-What for?

317
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:19,100
I think you're going to get a visit
from Mummy about all this.

318
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,220
Oh.

319
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,480
I realize I'm not making
anyone's life easy.

320
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,600
Yours especially.

321
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:32,320
But I'm determined to do this for you.
To give you what you want.

322
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,500
Thank you.

323
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:40,220
-I can't wait to tell Peter.
-I'd better go.

324
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,880
-Tommy.
-Your Majesty.

325
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,320
Mummy. This is a surprise.

326
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,200
I am a mother of two daughters
whom I love equally.

327
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:33,500
It seems that they each have problems
of equal size.

328
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,040
Obviously, we want Margaret to be happy,
to have the man she wants.

329
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,200
Yes.

330
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:47,600
But we must do everything in our power
to protect you as Queen.

331
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:51,620
-And as a sister.
-Protect me from what?

332
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:54,780
I've given Margaret my word
and I'm determined to support her.

333
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:58,860
They can marry in Scotland,
where I'm not head of the church.

334
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,000
Your Majesty,
I fear the matter is more intricate.

335
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,040
Let's be quite clear.

336
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,280
If Margaret were to marry Peter,
it would be a scandal.

337
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:14,540
Don't mistake your current popularity
for long-term security.

338
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:20,540
Your uncle's affair and abdication
almost destroyed the monarchy.

339
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,480
This could too.

340
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,280
Tommy?

341
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,240
Ma'am, what do you know
about the Royal Marriages Act of 1772?

342
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,480
-George II?
-Third, ma'am.

343
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:44,220
He had two younger brothers,
William and Henry.

344
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,740
Both of whom, I'm assuming,
made undesirable marriages.

345
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:51,300
One to an illegitimate shrew,
the other to a disreputable jade,

346
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:55,040
which caused an outrage
in parliament and the church.

347
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,280
Now in response, George III
asked his Prime Minister, Lord North,

348
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:04,040
to rush through a Royal Marriages Act
to prevent any future wilful young prince

349
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:09,620
or princess from making an ill-advised
or disadvantageous match

350
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,360
which might threaten the integrity
of the Royal house.

351
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,920
It decrees that until the age of 25,
any member of the Royal family

352
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,280
must secure
the sovereign's permission to marry.

353
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:28,500
-But?
-But, not thereafter.

354
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,340
-I see.
-So...

355
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,480
If Margaret were to wait
until after her 25th birthday,

356
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:41,560
she would be free to make any decision
she likes without your consent.

357
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,720
The important thing is,

358
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:48,560
it protects your relationship
with both church and government.

359
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:56,180
Well, I can see the advantages of that.
But, what's in it for her?

360
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:59,820
Mummy, she's only 23.
What does she do in the meantime?

361
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,400
In the meantime, she and Peter wait.

362
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,480
-Preferably, in separate countries.
-What?

363
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,440
It's the only way
to contain the story, ma'am.

364
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,320
Thank you, sir.

365
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,500
-Good morning, sir.
-Out of my way!

366
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:00,860
Come.

367
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,320
- Margaret!
- No!

368
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,300
Margaret!

369
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:34,900
Just until your 25th birthday.
Then, you would be free to do as you wish.

370
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:39,100
Look me in the eye and tell me.
Is it a posting or is it a banishment?

371
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:42,700
It's a posting. I promise.

372
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,240
It's just a way of managing the story,
keeping it off the front pages.

373
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,200
-Not a heartless attempt to split us up?
-No, of course not.

374
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,860
Papa did the same for Philip and me.
He made us wait.

375
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,820
For three months. This is for two years.

376
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,980
Think of it. Two years.

377
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,600
Why did you even dangle Scotland
under my nose?

378
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,960
Sorry.

379
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,300
All right.

380
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:49,740
If I do this for you, will you promise me
that this banishment...

381
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,260
Posting.

382
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,140
This banishment won't start
until after our trip to Rhodesia?

383
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,340
You know how much
we've been looking forward to it.

384
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,920
You're going to deny us that as well?

385
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:07,380
It's the sensitivity of you two together.

386
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:10,820
The photographers.
It would overshadow everything.

387
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:16,060
But when you get back,
you'll have some time together.

388
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,720
Alone.

389
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,180
I promise you that.

390
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:03,740
They offered me Johannesburg.
I refused.

391
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,060
Then Singapore...

392
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,520
I refused that too.

393
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:14,060
Then they came back with Brussels.

394
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,780
It's dreary, but at least it's close.

395
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:21,260
The whole thing feels like
a completely unnecessary,

396
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:23,060
unjustifiable punishment.

397
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,100
I know.

398
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,240
Perhaps your sister sensed that.

399
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,880
That is why she's asked me
to go to Northern Ireland.

400
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,160
What for?

401
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,680
To accompany her
on her trip to Belfast this week. To...

402
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:42,720
-put on a show of public approval.
-That's something, I suppose.

403
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,900
No substitute for Rhodesia, though.

404
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,200
No one wanted Philip.

405
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:02,960
She dug her heels in,
got the man she wanted, didn't she?

406
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,060
She did.

407
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,180
We ought to head back.

408
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,600
-Come on.
-No, wait. Kiss me.

409
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,580
You know we won't be able to
back at the house.

410
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,000
-Your Majesty.
-Tommy.

411
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,560
Just to run through
the order of the day.

412
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,740
-Yes.
-We'll be met at the airport

413
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:15,300
by the Governor of Northern Ireland,
Lord Wakehurst.

414
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:19,020
From there, we will be going
to the Belfast City Boundary

415
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,780
to be met by the Lieutenant
of the City of Belfast.

416
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:24,980
After that,
we will be presented to the Lord Mayor,

417
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:30,400
Alderman Percival Brown,
and the Town Clerk, John Dunlop.

418
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,400
Followed by a city luncheon at Civic Hall.

419
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,640
The other way around, I think.

420
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,320
-Ma'am?
-A civic luncheon at City Hall.

421
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:49,060
-Forgive me.
-Is everything all right?

422
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:57,840
I do hope it wasn't a mistake
inviting the group captain to join us.

423
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,760
You've never cared for him, Tommy.

424
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:05,680
No, I cared for him as long as
he did his job and knew his place.

425
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,980
My father held him in high regard.

426
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,460
As a member of staff,
not as a member of the family.

427
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,820
He has been a good friend to us all.

428
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,040
Too good, I would argue.
And he let his wife go in the process.

429
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,280
He was innocent in that regard.

430
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,280
She left of her own accord.

431
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:29,440
And he's a wonderful father
to those boys.

432
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:33,100
I'm just trying to manage
a difficult situation, ma'am.

433
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,300
As am I.

434
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,620
Sending him away
will break my sister's heart.

435
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,220
Hearts mend.

436
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,600
Was there anything else?

437
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,400
-No.
-Your Majesty.

438
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,200
...bringing Her Majesty the Queen
on a visit to Northern Ireland.

439
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:39,600
Her Majesty now walks
towards three-year-old Eileen Hall,

440
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,480
who presents her with a bouquet.

441
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:46,380
The Queen, who wears a coat of vivid
blue shantung with a matching hat,

442
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:49,420
finds herself sharing the limelight
with Group Captain Townsend,

443
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,420
who accompanies her on the tour.

444
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:55,420
The crowd get a last glimpse
of the Queen and her husband

445
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,380
before they begin the drive to City Hall.

446
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,740
En route, thousands pack the streets
to bid them welcome.

447
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,200
The Royal couple are welcomed
onto Balmoral Showground,

448
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:11,860
where 4,000 ex-servicemen and women
are gathered

449
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,780
to pay tribute to their sovereign.

450
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:17,240
Many Ulster schools
and youth organizations are represented,

451
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,320
and they all have a smile
and a wave for the Queen.

452
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,080
As London papers called once more today
for a statement from Buckingham Palace

453
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,080
to clarify the rumours of a romance
between Princess Margaret

454
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,600
and Group Captain Townsend,

455
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,400
newspaper editors from all over the world
sent their photographers

456
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:37,080
to scrutinize Townsend's face,
hoping for a clue.

457
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:46,060
The Queen can't be used
to sharing the limelight

458
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,040
with a member of her household.

459
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,200
But the gathered crowds
certainly seem as interested

460
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,280
in Group Captain Townsend
as in Her Majesty.

461
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:00,100
-Turn it off.
-Certainly, ma'am.

462
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:03,180
The crowds had to jostle with members
of the press and television

463
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:05,020
for following
the Royal party's every move.

464
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:12,300
I brought him along to show my gratitude
for his years of service

465
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:14,300
and to support my sister.

466
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:19,880
And I had hoped that attention
on Margaret and Peter would fade away.

467
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,200
But I could barely hear myself
speak today.

468
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:26,040
-The solution is an obvious one.
-Which is?

469
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:31,100
Bring forward the group captain's
relocation with immediate effect.

470
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,920
But that would mean him missing
his reunion with my sister in London?

471
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,400
And I gave her my word.

472
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:42,120
Well, sometimes best intentions
need to be reconsidered, Your Majesty.

473
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,000
You can always blame it on me.

474
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:51,900
No. Let's wait 24 hours.
Things might calm down tomorrow.

475
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,060
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

476
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:57,820
The Lambeg drummers, ma'am.
A special Orangemen's welcome.

477
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,260
Townsend? Captain Townsend?

478
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:26,060
-Townsend.
-Captain.

479
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:55,560
May God give you wisdom,
loyalty and faithfulness.

480
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:01,620
And may the future bring peace,
contentment and true happiness

481
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,980
to the people of Northern Ireland.

482
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:19,080
-Townsend!
-Townsend!

483
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,980
Townsend!

484
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,100
Do you have a moment, Lilibet?

485
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,220
Yes, of course.

486
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:12,800
I just wanted to apologize
for all the press attention.

487
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:16,920
And to thank you for inviting me along
in the first place.

488
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:22,460
-I do appreciate the gesture.
-It's the least I could do.

489
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:24,940
I regretted having to take you off
the Rhodesia trip.

490
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,480
Yes. Margaret and I
were so looking forward to it.

491
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,360
We have so many shared interests,
as you know,

492
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,640
we enjoy doing everything together.

493
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:40,520
We had hoped to find some time together
during her days off.

494
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,880
Walking, swimming, riding.

495
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,440
But not to be.

496
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,480
No.

497
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,840
Anyway, nice chatting.

498
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:09,700
Ma'am, if you wouldn't mind.

499
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:20,160
Just wondering if Her Majesty
has had time to think about the matter.

500
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,320
She has.

501
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:30,220
Take care of it, Tommy.
In whatever manner you see fit.

502
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:33,540
Yes, ma'am.

503
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,080
-Thank you, Your Majesty.
-Good night, sir.

504
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,320
Thank you so much, Peter.

505
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:13,720
Ma'am.

506
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,180
Group Captain Townsend.

507
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,240
The "man of the moment".

508
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:02,960
Do come up.

509
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,280
Will you sit?

510
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,160
Following consultation
with the government, the Foreign Office,

511
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,200
and Her Majesty's press secretary,

512
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:33,660
the decision has been taken
to move forward your posting

513
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:35,540
to Brussels with immediate effect.

514
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:38,220
A car is waiting to take you first
to your apartment,

515
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:41,460
where you will pack,
and then directly to the airfield.

516
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:44,940
The plane for Brussels
leaves in just under three hours.

517
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,080
There was some concern
that that might not give you enough time,

518
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,280
but I felt sure that as a military man
packing quickly

519
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:55,120
and unsentimentally
would come as second nature to you.

520
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:00,420
But that isn't what was agreed.

521
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:06,180
The agreement between
Margaret and Her Majesty the Queen,

522
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:09,160
with the certain knowledge
of Her Majesty the Queen Mother,

523
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:12,040
was that Margaret and I
were to spend some time together

524
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,240
upon her return from Rhodesia.

525
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:17,560
Before I travelled to Brussels.
Forty-eight hours at least.

526
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:21,600
Your proposal is a direct contravention
of that agreement.

527
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:28,780
Well, I cannot, nor would I ever presume,
to know the intimate details

528
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:32,540
of whatever agreements have
or have not been made within the family.

529
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:37,760
What I can tell you is that the position
of air attaché at the embassy fell vacant

530
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:41,440
unexpectedly early
and needs filling right away.

531
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:47,340
Of course, a crucial position
like the air attaché to the embassy

532
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:50,140
at Brussels
cannot be left vacant for very long.

533
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:54,860
I ask only that it remain so
until after the Princess returns,

534
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,120
as I was promised.

535
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,500
I'm afraid that will not be possible.

536
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:16,960
Tommy...

537
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,480
I understand
you're only trying to do your job.

538
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,480
But one thing the trip to Northern Ireland
has made very clear to me

539
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:33,680
is that the romance between Margaret
and myself has caught the public eye.

540
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:36,100
There is a momentum for us,

541
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:41,620
a sense of joy and celebration
which you would be wise to acknowledge.

542
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:45,920
The people can clearly see the sincerity
of the love between Margaret and me,

543
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,560
and I would advise you
not to reprehend us for that.

544
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,440
Such an act could backfire.

545
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:58,200
And now, if I may give you
some advice in turn, Peter.

546
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:00,900
That when referring to a member
of the Royal family,

547
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:05,340
you use the appropriate title.
In this case, Her Royal Highness.

548
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,640
When referring to the woman I love,
and who loves me,

549
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:12,640
and who is soon to be my wife,
I'll call her what I damn well like.

550
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,160
Her name is Margaret.

551
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,400
Car, Townsend.

552
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:21,920
Waiting.

553
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:28,340
Tick, tick, tick.

554
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,400
Bon voyage.

555
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:52,380
A tiny white community,
surrounded by primitive Africans,

556
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:57,940
grew into a young and flourishing nation

557
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:02,500
with the ever brightening promise
of more prosperity before it.

558
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:43,260
-Hurry up!
-Yes, sir!

559
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:48,120
 We honour a man
of remarkable vision,

560
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:52,920
who saw how great this land
could become, once civilized.

561
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:02,620
I wish continued prosperity and success

562
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,200
to all those who inhabit it.

563
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:14,920
Ladies and gentlemen,
please stand for the royal courtesy.

564
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:18,980
Telegram for Princess Margaret.

565
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:21,740
-The Queen!
-To the Queen!

566
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,800
Thank you.

567
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,920
-Madam.
-Thank you.

568
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,560
I need to speak to my sister.

569
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,040
Now!

570
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:18,060
Switchboard.

571
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:20,140
Her Royal Highness needs
to make an urgent call

572
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,300
to Her Majesty the Queen.

573
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:24,340
-A secure line will be required.
-Putting you through.

574
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:27,100
Foreign Office.
How may I direct your call?

575
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:31,320
Buckingham Palace. Victoria 48, 32.

576
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:35,240
I have Her Royal Highness
the Princess Margaret

577
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:36,360
for Her Majesty the Queen.

578
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:37,520
Sir.

579
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:41,020
Sir.

580
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:45,140
Princess Margaret
for Her Majesty the Queen.

581
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:47,540
-On a secure line.
-Of course!

582
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:49,080
What's taking so long?

583
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:51,280
Well, I gather
we have the secure line, ma'am.

584
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:53,480
They're just having trouble
locating Her Majesty.

585
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:57,020
What can be so difficult? She's the Queen.
She's fairly conspicuous.

586
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:58,260
She can't disappear.

587
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:31,060
Sandringham House, good evening.

588
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:36,480
Yes, sir. She's here.
Arrived about an hour ago.

589
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,400
Yes, sir, right away.

590
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:58,420
Ma'am, I've located the Queen.

591
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:06,340
The strip made up for it at Ascot

592
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:09,340
but we're really trying
not to let this happen again.

593
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:11,580
I think
he's a little bit inexperienced.

594
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:14,060
-What, the jockey, ma'am?
-Yes, I do.

595
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:16,300
- Telephone, Your Majesty.
- Right.

596
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:19,540
Yes, I'd like his scope recorded for
the first quarter mile tomorrow morning.

597
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:20,780
Yes, ma'am.

598
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:25,020
And then we might have to think
about pairing him with another rider.

599
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:26,600
Yes, ma'am.

600
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:28,400
Yes?

601
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:30,560
-How could you?
-Margaret.

602
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:33,880
You gave me your word. Promised me
he'd still be there when I got back.

603
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:35,960
-I did.
-Why has he been sent away?

604
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:40,540
-Banished like some criminal?
-Things got out of hand.

605
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:44,260
I took you at your word.
Believed everything you said.

606
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:47,900
How happy you were for me.
How you would support us.

607
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:49,320
Margaret.

608
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:50,760
You've been against us
from the beginning.

609
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:53,120
-Because you can't bear to be eclipsed.
-What?

610
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,960
Can't bear to be outshone
by your younger sister.

611
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:57,720
You've never liked it. Admit it.

612
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:01,900
You've hated how Peter and I
caught the popular imagination.

613
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:04,460
-Hated it enough to want to destroy it.
-This is madness.

614
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:10,620
Well, you fail to protect me.
I will fail to protect you in return.

615
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,320
Margaret.

616
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:17,440
You reap what you sow, sister.

617
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:06,960
"The laws of England say
that any man, once divorced,

618
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,720
is fully entitled to marry again.

619
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,720
If those laws are good enough
for England,

620
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,600
they are good enough
for the Royal family."

621
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:15,260
I know, but--

622
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:17,260
"The near-holy reverence shown
for the Crown

623
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:19,820
by the people of Britain
is a fact of life,

624
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:21,420
as the recent coronation has shown."

625
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:27,000
"Few other countries in the world
retain such regard for their monarchies.

626
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:31,160
But are those centuries of awe
drawing to an end?

627
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:36,360
Can that veneration be sustained
in the light of the Royal family's cruelty

628
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:39,340
to its very own members?"

629
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:45,980
"The Royal family
in Britain has survived a thousand proofs

630
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:50,060
that it is artificial and superfluous

631
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:57,600
and seems to have as deep a hold as ever
on the loyalties of the people.

632
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:01,680
It is not likely, however,
to survive the clear proof

633
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:05,680
that it is insensate and cruel."

634
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:13,940
"The treatment of her sister
has now jeopardized the future

635
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:15,820
of the monarchy in Britain."

636
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,280
In 48 hours, it will have passed.

637
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:28,280
If you're lucky.

638
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:31,000
I fear it will take longer than that
for Margaret to forgive me.

639
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:33,500
She will in time, she has to.

640
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:36,960
We all have to.

641
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:45,300
-Your Majesty.
-Be right with you.

642
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:49,820
-Hello, Mike. Where are you going?
-I told you. I was away for the weekend.

643
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:52,260
-Did you?
-Baron's having a house party.

644
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:54,140
-Who's Baron?
-Baron Nahoum.

645
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:55,780
President of our Lunch Club.

646
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:00,500
Don't look like that.
It's gentlemen only, right?

647
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:01,860
Absolutely.

648
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:06,800
Perfectly innocent.

649
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:23,340
-Shall we, old boy?
-Yes, I think let's.

650
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:25,340
Snifter en route, eh?

651
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:31,880
Toodle-oo.
