"My husband and I are deeply touched
by our welcome here."

3
00:00:19,535 --> 00:00:21,655
- Ma'am?
- Yes. How long do we have?

4
00:00:21,735 --> 00:00:23,015
We land in ten minutes.

5
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:24,895
No. Martin.

6
00:00:25,655 --> 00:00:28,175
- Will there be a microphone?
- I'm sure, ma'am.

7
00:00:28,255 --> 00:00:30,095
"Little more than 50 years ago..."

8
00:00:43,415 --> 00:00:44,655
[brass band plays]

9
00:01:06,575 --> 00:01:11,375
"My husband and I are deeply touched
by our welcome here this morning.

10
00:01:12,615 --> 00:01:16,255
Little more than 50 years ago,
Nairobi was a savage place,

11
00:01:17,295 --> 00:01:19,775
the home of wild animals
and uninhabited

12
00:01:19,855 --> 00:01:23,295
except for the occasional band
of nomadic herdsmen.

13
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:26,575
Now, it is a modern, vibrant city,

14
00:01:26,655 --> 00:01:29,655
a striking tribute
to the men and women of all races,

15
00:01:29,735 --> 00:01:32,775
who have made it a great center
of commerce and finance.

16
00:01:33,735 --> 00:01:37,215
Now, it remains only for me
to pass on the apologies

17
00:01:37,295 --> 00:01:39,495
of my father, King George..."

18
00:01:46,655 --> 00:01:50,975
Who is, no doubt, very jealous indeed
that I have come in his place.

19
00:01:51,055 --> 00:01:53,055
He's getting stronger every day.

20
00:01:54,175 --> 00:01:56,775
And he will be here
with you all again very soon.

21
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:06,175
Your Royal Highness, may I present

22
00:02:06,255 --> 00:02:09,935
Senior Chief Waruhiu wa Kung'u
of the Kikuyu.

23
00:02:10,015 --> 00:02:12,735
- Hello.
- Chief Sironka of the Kipsigis.

24
00:02:12,815 --> 00:02:13,815
- Hello.
- Good morning.

25
00:02:13,895 --> 00:02:16,215
- Lembui of the Maasai.
- Yes, hello.

26
00:02:16,295 --> 00:02:18,375
- Pelipel of the Turkana.
- Such a pleasure.

27
00:02:18,455 --> 00:02:21,735
Oh, gosh, look, I've got that one,
and that one, actually.

28
00:02:22,295 --> 00:02:24,495
Oh, Christ, I've got that one too.
Look!

29
00:02:25,495 --> 00:02:28,615
Oh, come off it, where did you steal
that one from, eh?

30
00:02:28,695 --> 00:02:31,495
Independence is sweeping
across the continent.

31
00:02:32,575 --> 00:02:35,815
Their support is important
more than ever.

32
00:02:35,895 --> 00:02:38,975
- Yes, thank you.
- Oh, like the hat.

33
00:02:42,855 --> 00:02:45,615
It's not a hat. It's a crown.

34
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:12,895
Breathe in, Your Majesty.

35
00:04:17,655 --> 00:04:18,815
And out.

36
00:04:23,695 --> 00:04:24,775
Well, well.

37
00:04:26,175 --> 00:04:28,815
I tell you, I woke up this morning
feeling like a new man.

38
00:04:30,135 --> 00:04:32,015
I think you should enjoy it, sir.

39
00:04:34,495 --> 00:04:36,695
Enjoy every minute while you can.

40
00:04:38,295 --> 00:04:39,735
Well, I intend to.

41
00:04:40,415 --> 00:04:43,455
And I'll head straight to Sandringham
if you give me the all-clear to shoot.

42
00:04:43,535 --> 00:04:44,895
Consider it given.

43
00:04:46,055 --> 00:04:48,535
- [bell ringing]
- [horn beeping]

44
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:57,295
- Sorry, ma'am, can I help you?
- Oh, Venetia Scott. I'm new.

45
00:04:57,375 --> 00:05:01,495
It's all right. She's with me.
Come along. Thank you.

46
00:05:04,735 --> 00:05:06,535
- He's awake.
- Yes, sir.

47
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:10,855
Actually, he's asked to see you.

48
00:05:21,015 --> 00:05:23,975
Oh. [grunts]

49
00:05:31,535 --> 00:05:32,895
Uh... Um...

50
00:05:39,975 --> 00:05:42,935
- Prime Minister?
- [Churchill] Is that the new girl?

51
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:49,335
- Yes, sir. Venetia.
- Louisa?

52
00:05:50,335 --> 00:05:52,215
- Venetia.
- Venetia.

53
00:05:52,295 --> 00:05:56,975
Have they told you terrible things,
your colleagues downstairs?

54
00:05:58,175 --> 00:05:59,975
Go on. Be candid.

55
00:06:00,855 --> 00:06:05,415
It is said... you can be difficult.

56
00:06:05,495 --> 00:06:07,775
I can be a monster.
Did they say that?

57
00:06:07,855 --> 00:06:10,015
- Yes, sir.
- It's true.

58
00:06:10,095 --> 00:06:12,735
But you need to be a monster
to defeat Hitler.

59
00:06:13,455 --> 00:06:16,415
- Did Jock give you my box?
- He did, sir.

60
00:06:16,495 --> 00:06:17,495
What's in it?

61
00:06:18,775 --> 00:06:22,615
- You'd like me to open it?
- Unless you have X-ray vision,

62
00:06:22,695 --> 00:06:27,455
you will need to open it, so as
to be able to tell me what's in it.

63
00:06:30,215 --> 00:06:31,215
Well?

64
00:06:32,575 --> 00:06:35,295
- Some papers about rationing.
- What else?

65
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,055
Some papers from the Exchequer.

66
00:06:37,135 --> 00:06:41,375
Anything from the Foreign Office?
About America or the Soviet Union?

67
00:06:41,455 --> 00:06:43,695
- No, sir.
- Oh, very well.

68
00:06:44,215 --> 00:06:48,415
Then start with the Exchequer.
Read it aloud.

69
00:06:48,495 --> 00:06:51,935
Don't be alarmed
if you hear no response.

70
00:06:52,015 --> 00:06:54,655
I shall be making mental notes.

71
00:06:54,735 --> 00:06:57,415
- "The economic situation...
- What?

72
00:07:05,615 --> 00:07:11,055
"The economic situation we have
inherited is worse than 1949...

73
00:07:12,575 --> 00:07:14,735
and, in many ways, worse... [yelps]

74
00:07:16,815 --> 00:07:19,735
worse than 1947.

75
00:07:21,895 --> 00:07:23,935
Confidence in Sterling is impaired.

76
00:07:24,455 --> 00:07:28,215
And now our latest estimates
suggest that in 1952..."

77
00:07:28,295 --> 00:07:31,655
...the United Kingdom will have
a deficit on its general balance

78
00:07:31,735 --> 00:07:37,095
of overseas payments of between
five and 600 million pounds.

79
00:07:37,175 --> 00:07:41,975
Given these circumstances, I'd be
interested to hear the PM's views

80
00:07:42,575 --> 00:07:46,775
regarding the chances for recovery.

81
00:07:56,775 --> 00:07:59,695
Either we get rid of him now
or we lose the next election

82
00:07:59,775 --> 00:08:02,615
and, quite possibly,
lose power for a whole generation.

83
00:08:02,695 --> 00:08:05,455
You must act, Anthony!
This is your time.

84
00:08:05,535 --> 00:08:08,855
The country needs
a younger, more dynamic man.

85
00:08:08,935 --> 00:08:11,815
And what do you expect me to do? Hmm?

86
00:08:15,055 --> 00:08:16,775
He's the party leader.

87
00:08:17,815 --> 00:08:22,175
And he became party leader
on our recommendation.

88
00:08:23,575 --> 00:08:25,735
I can't just push him out.

89
00:08:25,815 --> 00:08:28,935
Then you must go and see
the one person who can.

90
00:08:35,455 --> 00:08:37,055
[cheering]

91
00:09:01,615 --> 00:09:04,135
[clapping and chanting]

92
00:09:11,775 --> 00:09:15,335
- Welcome to Sagana Lodge, ma'am.
- Thank you very much.

93
00:09:19,215 --> 00:09:20,215
Hello.

94
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,735
Are those for me?
Thank you very much.

95
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:31,015
- <i>Karibu.</i>
- Thank you.

96
00:09:33,455 --> 00:09:37,295
Apparently, there's a large breeding
herd of elephants at Treetops.

97
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:40,495
- So we've got to get there early.
- Not too early, I hope.

98
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:46,735
And why? What else have you got
in mind for our little holiday?

99
00:09:48,095 --> 00:09:50,335
Why does everybody think,
just because we're royal,

100
00:09:50,415 --> 00:09:53,135
we like fine dining?
Don't they realize we're savages?

101
00:09:53,215 --> 00:09:55,535
Good for nothing
but school dinners and nursery food.

102
00:09:55,615 --> 00:09:58,375
It's all right, you can use your
fingers.

103
00:09:58,455 --> 00:10:01,575
- Philip.
- Look, stop, watch.

104
00:10:12,815 --> 00:10:13,815
Ma'am.

105
00:10:16,055 --> 00:10:17,135
Your Royal Highness.

106
00:10:18,135 --> 00:10:19,135
Kiss me.

107
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:22,975
Come on.

108
00:10:24,815 --> 00:10:28,855
His Majesty will return
from the shoot at 4 p.m.

109
00:10:48,735 --> 00:10:51,775
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon.

110
00:10:51,855 --> 00:10:54,455
His Majesty wondered
if you'd mind accompanying him

111
00:10:54,535 --> 00:10:56,855
on the shoot at Beecher's Club today.

112
00:10:57,695 --> 00:10:59,575
No, not at all.

113
00:10:59,655 --> 00:11:02,575
Still rather wet underfoot, I'm
afraid, after the storms yesterday,

114
00:11:02,655 --> 00:11:04,455
but we can provide you
with Wellington boots.

115
00:11:04,535 --> 00:11:07,255
- There's no need to worry.
- What size are you, sir?

116
00:11:07,335 --> 00:11:08,615
Nine and a half.

117
00:11:09,775 --> 00:11:14,375
Though my riding boots are a ten,
and my trench boots were an 11.

118
00:11:15,855 --> 00:11:17,535
Make of that what you will.

119
00:11:17,615 --> 00:11:18,815
[shouting]

120
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:31,175
Much of this
is just a function of age.

121
00:11:33,255 --> 00:11:34,895
He focuses almost entirely

122
00:11:34,975 --> 00:11:38,615
on issues relating to America
and the Soviet Union,

123
00:11:38,695 --> 00:11:40,775
so important domestic matters...

124
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:45,975
- are falling behind.
- [coughing]

125
00:11:50,735 --> 00:11:52,695
What do you suggest I do?

126
00:11:52,775 --> 00:11:55,535
Well, as sovereign, of course,
there is nothing you can do

127
00:11:55,615 --> 00:11:57,775
from a constitutional standpoint.

128
00:12:00,015 --> 00:12:05,735
But, as a friend... as Albert Windsor,

129
00:12:05,815 --> 00:12:09,775
you are the one person I can think of
to whom he might listen.

130
00:12:10,615 --> 00:12:16,295
Well, that is where we run
into difficulties, I'm afraid.

131
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:20,655
I no longer am Albert Windsor.

132
00:12:20,735 --> 00:12:27,415
That person was murdered by his
elder brother... when he abdicated.

133
00:12:27,495 --> 00:12:30,255
And, of course,
Albert Windsor would dearly love

134
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:35,735
to say to his old friend,
Winston Churchill, "Take a step back.

135
00:12:35,815 --> 00:12:39,735
Put your feet up. Let the younger
generation have a go now."

136
00:12:41,575 --> 00:12:43,375
But he is no longer with us

137
00:12:43,455 --> 00:12:48,055
and that void has been filled
by George the VI

138
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:51,495
who, it turns out,
is quite the stickler,

139
00:12:51,575 --> 00:12:56,935
and... [clears throat]
no more allow the sovereign

140
00:12:57,015 --> 00:13:01,575
to interfere with the Prime Minister
than stand for office himself.

141
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:04,455
Even when it's in
the national interest, sir?

142
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:08,535
The national interests?
Or Anthony Eden's interest?

143
00:13:19,855 --> 00:13:21,375
[King George coughs]

144
00:13:22,775 --> 00:13:25,375
The reason I agreed to grant you
an audience,

145
00:13:25,455 --> 00:13:28,455
not to hear your grievances
about Mr. Churchill

146
00:13:28,535 --> 00:13:30,535
but to communicate mine about you.

147
00:13:32,135 --> 00:13:33,295
Sir?

148
00:13:34,455 --> 00:13:36,855
The PM will step down in time.

149
00:13:38,255 --> 00:13:41,095
And until then, as sovereign,

150
00:13:41,175 --> 00:13:47,055
I do have the right to be consulted,
to encourage, to warn.

151
00:13:48,095 --> 00:13:54,695
It is better to be patient and get
what you desire in the right time...

152
00:13:56,015 --> 00:14:00,095
than have high office thrust upon you
when you are not ready.

153
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,215
I speak from personal experience.

154
00:14:07,255 --> 00:14:08,575
Foreign Secretary.

155
00:14:09,575 --> 00:14:11,575
- Your Majesty.
- Sir.

156
00:14:20,575 --> 00:14:21,775
Shall we begin to walk back, sir?

157
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:55,815
Use the accelerator,
we'll be all right. Thank you.

158
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,575
- Are we on foot from here?
- Philip. Philip.

159
00:14:57,655 --> 00:15:00,295
- Looks that way, sir.
- Thank you. Thank you.

160
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,095
- Your Highness.
- Thank you.

161
00:15:03,255 --> 00:15:05,335
I'm your guide.
I'll take you to Treetops.

162
00:15:05,415 --> 00:15:07,495
[Philip] Jolly good. Thank you.

163
00:15:07,575 --> 00:15:10,695
Pass me my rifle. Thank you.
And the shells.

164
00:15:15,975 --> 00:15:19,655
[guide] But I must ask you to proceed
in total silence from here on.

165
00:15:19,735 --> 00:15:21,575
Do not speak
unless absolutely necessary

166
00:15:21,655 --> 00:15:23,735
and then, only using a low voice.

167
00:15:23,815 --> 00:15:26,215
Along the way, we
may have to use some hand signals.

168
00:15:26,775 --> 00:15:28,895
This means stop and this means
freeze.

169
00:15:28,975 --> 00:15:32,575
We'll move in small groups, single
file, maximum three at a time.

170

00:36:27,415 --> 00:36:30,575
You're not going. I won't let you go.

340
00:36:39,335 --> 00:36:40,935
Ma'am, may I have a word?

341
00:36:52,615 --> 00:36:56,415
It appears Miss MacDonald neglected
to pack a black dress.

342
00:36:56,495 --> 00:36:57,895
We've called ahead to London

343
00:36:57,975 --> 00:37:01,055
and something will be brought
onto the plane before you disembark.

344
00:37:01,815 --> 00:37:02,815
Right.

345
00:37:04,335 --> 00:37:09,975
And a word of warning, ma'am.
A good many journalists outside.

346
00:37:13,615 --> 00:37:17,655
Royal correspondents mostly,
assigned to cover the tour.

347
00:37:20,695 --> 00:37:22,495
- Should I say something?
- No.

348
00:37:22,575 --> 00:37:23,935
That won't be necessary.

349
00:37:25,015 --> 00:37:29,055
Though it would help if we could
decide here and now on your name.

350
00:37:30,695 --> 00:37:35,095
- My name?
- Yes, ma'am. Your regnal name.

351
00:37:35,175 --> 00:37:39,975
That is the name you'll take
as Queen. Your father took George.

352
00:37:40,055 --> 00:37:41,935
Obviously his name is...

353
00:37:42,655 --> 00:37:44,415
was, Albert.

354
00:37:46,215 --> 00:37:50,455
And, before he abdicated,
your uncle took Edward, of course.

355
00:37:50,535 --> 00:37:52,455
His name was David.

356
00:37:52,535 --> 00:37:54,935
- What's wrong with my name?
- Nothing.

357
00:38:01,575 --> 00:38:05,615
Well, then, let's not overcomplicate
matters unnecessarily.

358
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:09,015
My name is Elizabeth.

359
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:12,775
Then, long live Queen Elizabeth.

360
00:38:30,055 --> 00:38:32,095
So sorry about the dress, ma'am.

361
00:38:36,975 --> 00:38:38,015
All right.

362
00:38:39,575 --> 00:38:40,935
Ready when you are, ma'am.

368
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:57,135
- It's the middle of the night.
- I couldn't sleep.

369
00:41:57,215 --> 00:42:00,335
No one in the country can sleep.

370
00:42:01,375 --> 00:42:03,655
I know one shouldn't believe
everything one hears...

371
00:42:03,735 --> 00:42:04,735
But?

372
00:42:06,175 --> 00:42:08,335
I was speaking
with Jock Colville's wife.

373
00:42:08,415 --> 00:42:10,295
- Mary. Margaret.
- Margaret.

374
00:42:10,375 --> 00:42:15,535
She said that Anthony went to see
the King ten days ago.

375
00:42:15,615 --> 00:42:17,175
What for?

376
00:42:17,255 --> 00:42:20,175
To express his concern
about your age.

377
00:42:20,255 --> 00:42:23,935
Your leadership. Your incapacity.

378
00:42:24,535 --> 00:42:27,935
- To ask him to bid you stand down.
- That's impossible.

379
00:42:28,015 --> 00:42:30,615
The King would never engage
in such treachery.

380
00:42:30,695 --> 00:42:34,775
And Anthony would never dare.
I've been like a father to him.

381
00:42:34,855 --> 00:42:37,935
I groomed him every step of the way.

382
00:42:41,335 --> 00:42:44,735
Well, ignore me, then.

383
00:42:46,015 --> 00:42:47,575
It's probably nothing.

384
00:42:48,895 --> 00:42:50,575
Come on, it's probably nothing.

385
00:42:52,295 --> 00:42:56,975
- What are you up to?
- It's my eulogy for the King.

386
00:42:57,055 --> 00:43:01,255
It's broadcast tomorrow
and the right words keep eluding me.

387
00:43:01,335 --> 00:43:05,615
- They'll want you to fail, you know.
- [sighs] I know.

388
00:43:05,695 --> 00:43:09,135
Anything less than perfect
will be a disaster.

389
00:43:12,015 --> 00:43:13,975
Anthony, eh?

390
00:43:23,615 --> 00:43:25,495
I can't sleep.

391
00:43:26,655 --> 00:43:27,655
No.

392
00:43:46,895 --> 00:43:48,095
I'm sorry.

393
00:43:50,455 --> 00:43:51,695
You're sorry?

394
00:43:54,415 --> 00:43:56,135
I'm sorry.

395
00:43:56,215 --> 00:43:58,095
I thought we'd have longer.

396
00:43:59,895 --> 00:44:04,215
Ma'am. Three hours to go now.

397
00:44:11,375 --> 00:44:15,415
- What do you think will happen?
- When?

398
00:44:18,095 --> 00:44:19,575
When we land.

399
00:44:21,935 --> 00:44:23,415
What will happen then?

400
00:44:31,735 --> 00:44:33,015
- Morning.
- Morning.

401
00:44:33,095 --> 00:44:36,095
The PM will not be joining us
this morning.

402
00:44:36,175 --> 00:44:40,415
He is very much tired
from all the emotion of yesterday.

403
00:44:40,495 --> 00:44:43,055
- So, where is he?
- He's still asleep.

404
00:44:44,615 --> 00:44:49,295
So, in his absence, as deputy,
I will preside.

405
00:44:53,255 --> 00:44:55,455
- The Queen's flight...
- Wait a minute, Anthony.

406
00:44:55,535 --> 00:44:59,775
If you're presiding over the meeting
on behalf of the PM,

407
00:45:01,415 --> 00:45:03,775
shouldn't you be sitting
in the appropriate chair?

408
00:45:03,855 --> 00:45:05,975
I don't think that's entirely necessary.

409
00:45:17,655 --> 00:45:18,855
Very well.

410
00:45:32,175 --> 00:45:36,495
So, the Queen's flight
is now over Italy,

411
00:45:36,575 --> 00:45:41,615
having left the El Adem airfield
in Libya at five this morning.

412
00:45:45,455 --> 00:45:47,135
Sorry to disturb.

413
00:45:52,495 --> 00:45:54,975
May I just say how very sorry I am

414
00:45:55,055 --> 00:45:57,055
that we'll not be working
together anymore.

415
00:45:57,615 --> 00:45:58,975
Why?

416
00:45:59,055 --> 00:46:02,175
I have to give way
to Sir Tommy Lascelles.

417
00:46:02,255 --> 00:46:06,895
As private secretary to the
sovereign, he's my senior.

418
00:46:07,695 --> 00:46:10,855
This is where I have to stand aside
for the great man.

419
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:14,055
Martin... so sorry.

420
00:46:21,535 --> 00:46:22,535
Ma'am.

421
00:46:25,375 --> 00:46:27,255
[Philip] What a nightmare.

422
00:46:27,815 --> 00:46:31,415
Charteris at least had one foot
in the real world.

423
00:46:31,495 --> 00:46:35,335
And was your man, our man,
on our side.

424
00:46:37,015 --> 00:46:38,215
Whereas Tommy Lascelles...

425
00:46:39,255 --> 00:46:41,655
<i>he's stuck in the land
that time forgot.</i>

00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:44,935
[door opens]

427
00:46:45,895 --> 00:46:49,975
- [Peter] You asked to see me, sir.
- I did.

428
00:46:51,935 --> 00:46:54,775
- Will you sit?
- Thank you, sir.

429
00:46:56,735 --> 00:47:00,535
I'd assumed that following the death
of His Late Majesty,

430
00:47:00,615 --> 00:47:04,415
you would,
at the earliest appropriate moment,

431
00:47:04,495 --> 00:47:07,295
be resuming your duties
with the Royal Air Force.

432
00:47:07,375 --> 00:47:08,495
Yes, sir.

433
00:47:10,775 --> 00:47:12,735
I mentioned this to the Queen...

434
00:47:14,495 --> 00:47:17,935
the Queen Mother, this morning,
who then asked me,

435
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:20,575
quite unusually,
to ask you whether you might like

436
00:47:20,655 --> 00:47:23,775
- to reconsider such a departure.
- Oh, sir?

437
00:47:23,855 --> 00:47:27,175
She felt that you had enjoyed
an uncommonly close association

438
00:47:27,255 --> 00:47:30,975
with her late husband
and earned not just his trust,

439
00:47:31,055 --> 00:47:33,015
but the trust and affection
of the family.

440
00:47:33,255 --> 00:47:34,535
Thank you, sir.

441
00:47:34,615 --> 00:47:37,695
In the light of this, she wondered
whether you might consider

442
00:47:37,775 --> 00:47:39,215
staying on in a new role,

443
00:47:39,295 --> 00:47:43,095
as comptroller of the Queen Mother's
household.

444
00:47:43,175 --> 00:47:45,495
- I see.
- A kind and generous offer.

445
00:47:45,575 --> 00:47:48,415
As befits the widow of a kind...

446
00:47:49,695 --> 00:47:51,375
and generous man.

447
00:47:53,055 --> 00:47:54,815
But, while I'm sure you're flattered,

448
00:47:54,895 --> 00:47:56,695
I don't expect you to accept
the post.

449
00:47:56,775 --> 00:47:59,095
Hence my discouragement of the offer.

450
00:47:59,175 --> 00:48:02,015
I didn't want Her Majesty to suffer
the embarrassment of a refusal.

451
00:48:02,095 --> 00:48:03,935
Why would I not accept, sir?

452
00:48:04,615 --> 00:48:07,295
Well, you're asking
the wrong question, Townsend.

453
00:48:07,375 --> 00:48:09,135
Why would you?

454
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:11,495
You're a decorated war hero,
still in your prime,

455
00:48:11,575 --> 00:48:13,695
and comptroller of the Queen Mother's
household

456
00:48:13,775 --> 00:48:15,615
has no military associations.

457
00:48:15,695 --> 00:48:17,655
It would take you away
from your wife and children.

458
00:48:18,855 --> 00:48:20,215
After all, the person

459
00:48:20,295 --> 00:48:24,655
with whom you enjoyed the uncommonly
close understanding is deceased.

460
00:48:30,415 --> 00:48:32,655
Unless I'm missing something.

461
00:48:33,615 --> 00:48:35,295
Unless, there is someone else

462
00:48:35,375 --> 00:48:38,175
with whom you enjoy
an uncommonly close understanding,

463
00:48:38,255 --> 00:48:40,735
which would make accepting this post
more attractive.

464
00:48:42,615 --> 00:48:44,575
I don't know
what you're referring to.

465
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:46,695
Don't you, Group Captain Townsend?

466
00:48:46,775 --> 00:48:49,615
Husband and father.

467
00:48:51,615 --> 00:48:52,735
No, sir.

468
00:49:01,895 --> 00:49:03,455
You're probably telling yourself

469
00:49:03,535 --> 00:49:08,415
that because no one has confronted
you about it, that no one can know.

470
00:49:09,055 --> 00:49:12,775
Allow me to disabuse you
of that delusion.

471
00:49:12,855 --> 00:49:16,415
Within the close community
of those that serve the family,

472
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:20,535
I regret to tell you,
that talk, ugly talk,

473
00:49:20,615 --> 00:49:23,855
unbecoming tittle-tattle
is of little else.

474
00:49:23,935 --> 00:49:27,535
Now I'm well aware of the toll
that round-the-clock service

475
00:49:27,615 --> 00:49:30,575
takes on the private lives
of those that serve.

476
00:49:30,655 --> 00:49:37,215
I am also aware of the feelings
generated by continued close proximity

477
00:49:37,295 --> 00:49:40,015
to the people you are working for,
but I would hate you

478
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:43,495
to mistake those feelings
for anything else.

479
00:49:54,815 --> 00:49:57,295
Will you thank the Queen Mother
for her kind offer?

480
00:50:02,935 --> 00:50:05,375
I should be delighted to accept.

481
00:50:05,455 --> 00:50:08,695
There's no rush.
Take your time to think it over.

482
00:50:09,375 --> 00:50:12,335
Seventy-two hours... a week.

483
00:50:12,415 --> 00:50:14,775
I want you to make
the right decision.

484
00:50:14,855 --> 00:50:18,895
I already have, sir.
The answer is yes.

485
00:50:49,815 --> 00:50:53,615
- Gentlemen.
- Winston.

486
00:50:53,695 --> 00:50:55,615
Impeccable timing.

487
00:51:00,175 --> 00:51:01,895
That's the one.

488
00:51:11,215 --> 00:51:13,655
Your Majesty,
I've been asked to give you this.

489
00:51:15,175 --> 00:51:17,415
And this, Ma'am,
from Her Majesty Queen Mary.

490
00:51:17,495 --> 00:51:18,575
Thank you.

491
00:51:22,335 --> 00:51:25,615
Thank you, Charteris.
I'll take over from here.

492
00:51:31,735 --> 00:51:33,295
- Thank you, Martin.
- Thank you, sir.

493
00:51:38,335 --> 00:51:39,615
Your Majesty.

494
00:51:41,735 --> 00:51:43,015
Martin...

495
00:52:01,975 --> 00:52:04,455
[Queen Mary] <i>Dearest Lilibet,</i>

496
00:52:04,535 --> 00:52:07,615
<i>I know how you loved your papa,
my son.</i>

497
00:52:08,495 --> 00:52:12,535
<i>And I know you will be as devastated
as I am by this loss.</i>

498
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:17,055
<i>But you must put those sentiments
to one side now,</i>

499
00:52:17,135 --> 00:52:19,535
<i>for duty calls.</i>

500
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:24,055
<i>The grief for your father's death
will be felt far and wide.</i>

501
00:52:24,135 --> 00:52:27,135
<i>Your people will need
your strength and leadership.</i>

502
00:52:32,735 --> 00:52:36,975
<i>I have seen three great monarchies
brought down through their failure</i>

503
00:52:37,055 --> 00:52:40,255
<i>to separate personal indulgences
from duty.</i>

504
00:52:42,255 --> 00:52:46,135
<i>You must not allow yourself
to make similar mistakes.</i>

505
00:52:47,015 --> 00:52:52,175
<i>And while you mourn your father,
you must also mourn someone else.</i>

506
00:52:53,175 --> 00:52:55,415
<i>Elizabeth Mountbatten.</i>

507
00:52:55,975 --> 00:53:02,535
<i>For she has now been replaced
by another person, Elizabeth Regina.</i>

508
00:53:06,055 --> 00:53:10,815
<i>The two Elizabeths will frequently be
in conflict with one another.</i>

509
00:53:11,895 --> 00:53:16,975
<i>The fact is, the Crown must win.</i>

510
00:53:18,575 --> 00:53:21,815
<i>Must always win.</i>

511
00:53:24,855 --> 00:53:26,495
- Ready, ma'am?
- It's all right.

512
00:53:26,575 --> 00:53:28,095
I'll escort her down from here.

513
00:53:28,175 --> 00:53:31,295
No, sir. If you don't mind,
the Crown takes precedence.

514
00:54:00,175 --> 00:54:01,575
Stand by, everybody.

515
00:54:22,495 --> 00:54:24,655
[man on radio] <i>This is London.</i>

516
00:54:25,175 --> 00:54:28,735
[man] Three, two, one.

517
00:54:56,335 --> 00:55:03,055
When the death of the King was
announced to us yesterday morning,

518
00:55:03,135 --> 00:55:07,975
there struck a deep
and somber note in our lives,

519
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:11,175
<i>which resounded far and wide,</i>

520
00:55:12,615 --> 00:55:18,415
<i>stilled the clatter
and traffic of 20th century life,</i>

521
00:55:20,655 --> 00:55:26,695
<i>and made countless millions
of human beings around the world</i>

522
00:55:26,775 --> 00:55:30,135
<i>pause and look around them.</i>

523
00:55:33,295 --> 00:55:39,175
<i>The King was greatly loved
by all his peoples.</i>

524
00:55:40,415 --> 00:55:45,215
The greatest shocks ever felt
by this island

525
00:55:45,295 --> 00:55:47,575
fell upon us in his reign.

526
00:55:48,655 --> 00:55:51,655
Never, in our long history

527
00:55:51,735 --> 00:55:57,375
were we exposed to greater perils
of invasion and destruction.

528
00:56:01,895 --> 00:56:07,695
<i>The late King, who assumed
the heavy burden of the Crown</i>

529
00:56:07,775 --> 00:56:10,095
<i>when he succeeded his brother,</i>

530
00:56:12,015 --> 00:56:15,735
<i>lived through every minute
of this struggle</i>

531
00:56:17,095 --> 00:56:19,095
<i>with a heart that never quavered</i>

532
00:56:20,935 --> 00:56:24,175
<i>and a spirit undaunted.</i>

533
00:56:32,375 --> 00:56:37,055
In the end, death came as a friend.

534
00:56:40,495 --> 00:56:45,055
<i>And after a happy day
of sunshine and sport,</i>

535
00:56:45,135 --> 00:56:50,095
<i>and after a goodnight
to those who loved him best,</i>

536
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:51,655
<i>he fell asleep,</i>

537
00:56:52,895 --> 00:56:55,815
<i>as every man or woman</i>

538
00:56:55,895 --> 00:57:00,935
<i>who strives to fear God
and nothing else in the world,</i>

539
00:57:01,015 --> 00:57:02,495
<i>may hope to do.</i>

540
00:57:04,535 --> 00:57:05,975
[sobs]

541
00:57:21,175 --> 00:57:23,495
<i>Now, I must leave</i>

542
00:57:23,575 --> 00:57:29,295
<i>the treasures of the past
and turn to the future.</i>

543
00:57:29,375 --> 00:57:34,335
<i>Famous have been the reigns
of our queens.</i>

544
00:57:34,415 --> 00:57:37,455
<i>Some of the greatest periods
in our history</i>

545
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:40,295
<i>have unfolded under their scepters.</i>

546
00:57:42,815 --> 00:57:46,415
<i>Queen Elizabeth II,</i>

547
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:49,775
<i>like her namesake, Queen Elizabeth I,</i>

548
00:57:50,855 --> 00:57:57,175
<i>did not pass her childhood in any
certain expectation of the Crown.</i>

549
00:57:58,375 --> 00:58:01,655
<i>This new Elizabethan age</i>

550
00:58:01,735 --> 00:58:07,015
<i>comes at a time when mankind stands
uncertainly poised...</i>

551
00:58:07,095 --> 00:58:08,335
Wait.

552
00:58:08,415 --> 00:58:11,855
<i>...on the edge of catastrophe.</i>

553
00:58:15,215 --> 00:58:20,935
I, whose youth was passed
in the august, unchallenged

554
00:58:21,015 --> 00:58:25,855
and tranquil glories
of the Victorian era,

555
00:58:25,935 --> 00:58:31,655
<i>may well feel the thrill
in invoking once more</i>

556
00:58:31,735 --> 00:58:36,375
the prayer and the anthem,

557
00:58:36,455 --> 00:58:40,575
God Save the Queen.

558
00:58:41,975 --> 00:58:44,455
[all] God Save the Queen.
