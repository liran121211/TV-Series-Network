1
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,340
This way, madam.

2
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,160
At the end of the bar.

3
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,620
-Hello.
-Hello, Porchey!

4
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,380
-You found the place all right?
-The taxi driver did, yes.

5
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,300
Of course. Wonderful.

6
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,780
Lord Porchester.

7
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,400
Ladies.

8
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,020
Is it just me,
or is this place faintly ridiculous?

9
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,080
Two of my great hates in life,
fine dining and central London.

10
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,680
I just thought it's the kind
of special occasion place one came

11
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,520
if one had a special question to ask.

12
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,500
At this moment I wish I were a poet,
not a horse-breeder.

13
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,320
Will you marry me?

14
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,480
Oh, Porchey.

15
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,080
-That sounds like a "no."
-No, it's not a "no".

16
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,120
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

17
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,300
-That's... 12 no's.
-I would love to.

18
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,520
On one condition.

19
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,480
That you don't still hold a torch for her.

20
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,140
Who?

21
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,740
Oh. Her.

22
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,640
I know how close you were,
and how close your families still are.

23
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,740
It's true. She and I, we are close.

24
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,260
I was close to her father.
I am close to her sister.

25
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,060
Our families are close.

26
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,960
In many ways, and I speak as a breeder
myself, it would have been a good match.

27
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,080
- Perfect match.
- I won't deny it.

28
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,700
Except for the fact
it was never on the cards.

29
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,240
For her, there was only ever Philip.

30
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,040
And for you?

31
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,220
There's only you.

32
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:10,940
Lilibet?

33
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:06,420
Right you are, Jock.
Yes, I'll let him know. Thank you.

34
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,900
I'm sure he'll be delighted. Bye.

35
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,600
Are you winning?

36
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:26,760
No. There was one, brief,
tantalizing moment

37
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:32,420
when I thought I had it.
I moved in for the kill.

38
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,880
But then one wrong brushstroke
and it got away once again.

39
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:42,100
I've just been talking to Jock
about your 80th birthday.

40
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,820
No, don't mention it.

41
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,400
Because it happens on the same day
as the opening of Parliament,

42
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,920
they've decided to combine events

43
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,500
and hold a reception in your honor
at the Great Hall.

44
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,140
Oh, that's very nice.

45
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,940
Oh, and it's going to be
Graham Sutherland.

46
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,360
-Who?
-The painter.

47
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,600
-To paint your portrait.
-What portrait?

48
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:07,920
It's the official portrait commissioned
by both Houses. It's your present.

49
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,280
Sutherland? Never heard of him.

50
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,160
He's got quite the reputation.
He's a modernist.

51
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,800
Oh. Not sure I can trust a modernist
with an English name.

52
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:24,160
Give me a German modernist. Or an Italian.

53
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,740
They're the ones
who have to start all over again.

54
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:30,140
Whatever would an Englishman
want to change?

55
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,020
It's grand to be home again
after so long an absence.

56
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:00,760
The surgeon who operated on me
told me yesterday that all was well.

57
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:06,480
I'll need to have a further period
of convalescence, put on some weight,

58
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,660
but there is nothing else to worry about.

59
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:12,740
As I said, it's grand to be home again.

60
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:17,260
I look forward to being back at work
just as soon as possible.

61
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:21,940
Thank you!

62
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,240
Thank you!

63
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:41,700
-Hello?
-Porchey? I hope I'm not disturbing.

64
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,480
-Goodness.
-Am I disturbing?

65
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,060
-No.
-Good.

66
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,980
It's Aureole.
I think we're making a mistake.

67
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:57,380
-I think we should lead from the start.
-And I think you're wrong.

68
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,860
But we both know
he doesn't hold up naturally.

69
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,340
We tried holding him up
against Darius before. And Darius won.

70
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,460
That was the Guineas, which is a mile.

71
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,420
This is the King George.
A mile and a half.

72
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,460
What will we do
if he plays up before the race?

73
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,840
He always plays up. That's who he is.

74
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,600
You don't seem the slightest bit worried.

75
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,180
Anything else?

76
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:26,900
Well, can I just say one more time,
for the record...

77
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,400
I think we should start fast,
and run at a good clip.

78
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,000
-Noted.
-I am right sometimes, you know.

79
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,000
Even you said yourself
that I have good instincts.

80
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:43,020
You do.
And I might well live to regret it.

81
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,120
-That, and a good many other things.
-Oh, dear. Such as?

82
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,980
Good night.

83
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,720
Mr. Sutherland, Prime Minister.

84
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,600
-Good morning.
-How do you do?

85
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,760
-Good morning, hello. How do you do?
-Good morning.

86
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:38,480
-How do you do, sir? It's an honor.
-No, no. The honor is mine.

87
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,080
So, where do you want me?

88
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,560
So, will we be engaged
in flattery or reality?

89
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,480
Are you going to paint me
as a cherub or a bulldog?

90
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,500
I imagine there are a great number
of Mr. Churchills.

91
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,900
Yes, indeed there are.

92
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,940
Well, as you search for him,

93
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:13,620
perhaps I can implore you
not to feel the need to be too accurate.

94
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:18,820
-Why? Accuracy is truth.
-No. For accuracy, we have the camera.

95
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:25,840
Painting is the higher art.
I paint a bit myself, you know.

96
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,900
Yes, sir, I know.

97
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:34,260
And I never let accuracy get in the way
of truth if I don't want it to.

98
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:40,100
If I see some landscape I like, and I wish
there wasn't a factory in the background,

99
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,120
I leave the factory out.

100
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:50,900
So, Mr. Sutherland, tell me,
I'm fascinated. What is your process?

101
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,840
First, I shall take some photographs,

102
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,400
they'll be useful as reference
when I get back to the studio.

103
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,960
Then I shall do some charcoal sketches,
studies of the head, the hands

104
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,500
and then I'll work those sketches up.

105
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,080
The actual painting up
will be done in my studio at home.

106
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,500
-Is this... Do you mind?
-Perfectly all right. Carry on.

107
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,640
Well, what pose are you thinking of?

108
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,680
Seated.

109
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:36,880
I could try standing?
It might be more commanding. Dynamic.

110
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,280
It might make me look younger.

111
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:46,100
I thought the painting was supposed
to celebrate reaching a certain age?

112
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,780
Four score years, Winston.

113
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:54,380
-I think seated is more senatorial.
-Oh, senatorial.

114
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,580
What nonsense.

115
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,880
Yes, I agree.

116
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,660
Cigar or no cigar?

117
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,660
No cigar.

118
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:19,140
-Garter robes or no garter robes?
-No finery.

119
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,840
No grandiosity.

120
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,560
Dressed merely as a parliamentarian.

121
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,780
How prosaic.

122
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,520
-I liked him.
-Yes, I could tell.

123
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,640
You were smitten,
blushing like a little girl.

124
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:43,500
-Well, he is rather a wow.
-A "wow"?

125
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:48,240
Tall and handsome, saturnine.
A bit of a Heathcliff.

126
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,400
He wants total control.

127
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,760
Well, any artist worth anything
would insist on that.

128
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,420
-You don't really want a flatterer.
-Yes, I do.

129
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,220
No, you don't.
Besides, it's manifestly clear he's a fan.

130
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,280
Oh, no, don't be silly.
You can smell the socialism on him.

131
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,680
Even the socialists
acknowledge you saved the country.

132
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,480
Through gritted teeth.

133
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,780
I have the protective instincts
of a loving wife

134
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:15,540
and I can tell you
this one is not an assassin.

135
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,620
Oh, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa.
Look. Look at this.

136
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:35,020
It's Aureole, the Queen's Aureole,
the Queen's horse, followed by...

137
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,400
Isn't he marvelous?

138
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,260
Isn't he clever?

139
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,860
You were absolutely... No.

140
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,400
No, he won.

141
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,800
You were absolutely right.

142
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,720
-He's so clever!
-I know. I know.

143
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,420
-What a champion.
-What a champion.

144
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,160
-Good boy.
-Hello.

145
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,440
I remember getting the phone call
from your father.

146
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:33,640
When he was born.
By Hyperion and out of Angelola.

147
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,320
Yes, we gave him his first milk.
Do you remember?

148
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:41,140
Watching him grow up, everyone thought
his elder brother would be the star.

149
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,780
Your clever Papa
always had an instinct for this one.

150
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,880
-He's the underdog.
-And he backed him.

151
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,880
-And an underdog became a star.
-Yes, and his favorite horse.

152
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:56,980
So, what's next for our champion?

153
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,600
Well, we have received an invitation
to the Laurel International.

154
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,040
-America?
-Yes, next month.

155
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:11,400
He's what, four?
Already at the older end of the spectrum.

156
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:16,040
-If you were asking my opinion...
-That is why I asked you here today.

157
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:21,060
My honest advice,
I'd consider retiring him now.

158
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,820
At the top of his game.

159
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,940
The best middle distance horse in Europe,
with a sky-high market value.

160
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,720
Let him earn you
some proper money as a stud.

161
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:36,520
I'm surprised to hear you turning down
the opportunity of going to America.

162
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,340
Why?

163
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:41,580
Well, that's where your girlfriend's from,
isn't it?

164
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:46,540
-Fiancé.
-Fiancé? Goodness.

165
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:53,340
Who is she? Money, I hope.
So you can keep up the stables.

166
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:56,220
-Actually, she's a Portsmouth.
-Oh, dear. So no money.

167
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,520
Some money. But horse mad.
Well, she'd have to be.

168
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,380
You'd approve, I think.

169
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:09,460
-Well, can I meet her?
-If you promise you won't scare her.

170
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,660
-Why would I scare her?
-You're the Queen!

171
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,480
-Only some of the time.
-All the time.

172
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,960
And that makes you terrifying.
And she's heard a lot about you.

173
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:24,120
-From whom?
-From me. Some of it nice, too.

174
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:04,460
Oh, the one you let get away.

175
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,680
-What?
-He's always carried a torch for you.

176
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:12,500
Porchey? Utter nonsense.

177
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,680
He told me himself.
One night while in his cups.

178
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,980
That doesn't count.

179
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,220
When a man's had a drink,
that's when the truth comes out.

180
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:29,300
No. That's when the nonsense comes out.
Besides, we have interests in common.

181
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,360
Horses aren't an interest to you.
They're a passion.

182
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,680
-A passion your husband doesn't share.
-He has other passions.

183
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,900
So I hear.

184
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,640
-Sir.
-Good morning.

185
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,520
The Foreign Secretary is here, sir.
Shall I show him in?

186
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,260
No.

187
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,140
Not here.

188
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,740
Sorry to keep you waiting.

189
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,740
As apposite as ever.

190
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,860
I didn't mean it like that.

191
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:49,960
-There's ugliness in the air, Anthony.
-I have nothing of beauty to say.

192
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:54,840
Then say what you must,
deposit your ugliness and go.

193
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,860
I have more important things to do.

194
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,520
Very well.

195
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,620
At some point,

196
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
every leader must ask himself
whether by staying in office,

197
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,280
he is giving to the country,

198
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:21,820
or taking from it. Helping or harming.

199
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,280
And I would suggest
that for some time now,

200
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,200
you have been taking and harming.

201
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:36,820
And therefore I come to you, in the name
of the party and of the country,

202
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,240
for the very last time, Winston,

203
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:45,920
-to bid you to stand down.
-I will in good time, at the right time.

204
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,980
The right time was nine years ago
when you lost us the election.

205
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:53,340
And I have since avenged that defeat
by winning us the last election.

206
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,020
I won us that, Winston! I won that!

207
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,080
People voted Conservative
in the clear expectation

208
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:08,460
-that you would give way to me.
-That is such rubbish!

209
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,760
They voted Conservative
because they couldn't stomach socialism!

210
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,940
Inflation is out of control.

211
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:20,940
And with every misjudgment,
with every miscalculation,

212
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:25,540
with every utterance you make, that
appetite to return to the left is growing!

213
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,100
Be careful, Anthony,

214
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:30,660
too much excitement is not good
for one so soon after an operation.

215
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:35,060
Spoken by a man who
only two months ago was effectively dead.

216
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,160
-Which makes two of us.
-I have recovered.

217
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:44,080
That's not what I hear. I hear
you are a shadow of your former self.

218
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,620
That when you walk,
the pills rattle around inside of you!

219
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,640
I have something
that you will never see again.

220
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:57,000
-A clean bill of health.
-Stalin said the same.

221
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,400
He died groveling on the floor!

222
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:04,180
Mr. Sutherland is here.

223
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,780
-Hello, Anthony.
-Anthony was just leaving.

224
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,840
Hello, Clemmie.

225
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,400
Yes, I was... just leaving.

226
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,840
Here we are.

227
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,800
Morning.

228
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,580
-Morning.
-Sir, this is my wife, Kathleen.

229
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,240
She assists me sometimes.
I hope you don't mind.

230
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,540
Over here.

231
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,400
-What's that you're using?
-Pencil.

232
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,840
Yeah. But which kind?

233
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,720
4B or 6B, not sure.

234
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,080
It's a 6B.

235
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,040
- And on what paper?
- Drawing paper.

236
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,440
I favor heavy-weight cotton,
cold pressed, deckle edged.

237
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,540
Sized with gelatin.

238
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:41,560
How many paintings does your husband
complete in a year, Mrs. Sutherland?

239
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,760
Three or four.

240
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,360
Would you care to guess
how many I average?

241
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,880
-Ten? 15?
-60!

242
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,680
Of course, I'm just a hobbyist,
an enthusiast.

243
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,580
Not a major artist like your husband.

244
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,100
Taking his time.

245
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,400
Over here.

246
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,320
I did a little reading about you,
Mr. Sutherland, after our last session.

247
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,460
-Did you?
-Yeah. Quite interesting.

248
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,880
From what I read, this is all
very new to you, this portraiture.

249
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,720
I don't think anyone starts out
wanting to be a portraitist.

250
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:59,540
Yeah. But in your search for your métier,
you've tried a bit of everything.

251
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:04,600
That's true.
I came to painting quite late.

252
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:08,020
And now that you've found it,
you'll never leave it, yes?

253
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,520
Yeah. I quite understand.

254
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,240
How is it, Mrs. Sutherland?

255
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,800
It has truth.

256
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,700
-Am I to be allowed a peek?
-No.

257
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,240
Well, why not? I could give you advice.

258
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:46,460
After all,
I know this face better than you do.

259
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:50,140
If you've made the neck too thick
or the arms too long, I can tell you.

260
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:54,620
I find in general people have
very little understanding of who they are.

261
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:58,060
One has to turn a blind eye to so much
of oneself in order to get through life.

262
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,420
And you see it as your responsibility
to bring all that out into the open?

263
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,320
Certainly. The good as well as the bad.

264
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:07,180
Just concentrate on the good,
and all will be well.

265
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,400
You're not just painting me, you know.

266
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,000
You're painting the Prime Minister
of the United Kingdom of Great Britain

267
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,120
and Northern Ireland, and everything
that great office represents.

268
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,100
Democracy. Freedom.

269
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:25,060
The highest ideals of government
and leadership. Just remember that.

270
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,240
-Yes?
-Lord Porchester, Your Majesty.

271
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,940
-Thank you.
-Plug in.

272
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:44,260
-Porchey?
-What a palaver.

273
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,740
-What is?
-Getting through to you.

274
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,240
I picked up the phone to you just after
nine this morning. It's now gone midday.

275
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,920
Oh, don't exaggerate.
But, yes, I know, it is infuriating.

276
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,340
Fire away.

277
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,520
You asked me to come up with some figures
for you with regard to Aureole.

278
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,760
Although I'm numerically dyslexic,
runs in the family I'm afraid,

279
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,840
like the high forehead.

280
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,280
I have done the sums,
see if this helps you with your decision.

281
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,460
In the course of his lifetime
as a racehorse,

282
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:13,500
Aureole has made you
just over 40,000 pounds.

283
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,260
Goodness.

284
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:18,740
But if you were to put him out to stud,
he could make you far more.

285
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:21,460
He's a recognized champion,
with a top-notch pedigree.

286
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,420
You could stand him at Wolferton Stud
for top dollar.

287
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,560
Well, that's a decision then.

288
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,560
Good.

289
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:35,940
And in the meantime,
I'll ask if I can get you a direct line.

290
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:39,140
-To you?
-Yes, to me. Why?

291
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,300
Was there anyone else
you wanted to speak to here?

292
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,340
-No.
-Good.

293
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,600
What is it, "top dollar?" I need numbers.

294
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,200
-400.
-A pop? A shot?

295
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,840
Sorry, I'm trying to find a less
onomatopoeic expression for...

296
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,560
-I know what it is.
-A shag.

297
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,920
A cover.

298
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:07,460
-A cover?
-Yes, that's the correct term for...

299
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:10,140
-A horse hump?
-Yes.

300
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,760
So, what might you earn then
over the course of the year?

301
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:19,880
Well, in one year alone,
Aureole might cover 40 mares.

302
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:24,300
-Making about 16,000 pounds.
-Good for him.

303
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:29,360
In the course of his lifetime at the stud,
he might sire 500, 600 foals,

304
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:32,180
making me over 200,000 pounds.

305
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,860
Creating an entire generation
of offspring.

306
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:37,940
-Yes.
-Father to all the foals in our stables

307
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,740
and any other stable
that could afford him.

308
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,320
Yes.

309
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,800
Oh, I see,
so in time, every horse out there

310
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:50,160
could somehow be related to Aureole.

311
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,640
-Yes, I suppose so.
-Like old man Carnarvon.

312
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,720
Who?

313
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,360
Your friend Porchey's father.

314
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,480
-Porchey?
-No, like I said, his father.

315
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:08,580
-Yes, they're both called Porchey.
-Wasn't that the rumor?

316
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:12,660
-What rumor?
-Well, that he'd had so many affairs,

317
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:16,720
an entire generation of
British aristocrats was related to him.

318
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:21,880
An illegitimate "Porchey"
in every great house in the land.

319
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,420
High foreheads everywhere.

320
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,800
-And numerical dyslexia.
-What?

321
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,760
-Nothing.
-What?

322
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,140
Nothing!

323
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,480
Michael!

324
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,420
Dear boy!

325
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,040
- Good night.
- Good night.

326
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,460
Let me have a look at you.

327
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,860
-Marvelous.
-Shall we?

328
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:56,020
Come on. You look beautiful.

329
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,080
-How is he?
-Not too bad, sir. This way.

330
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,640
-Morning.
-Morning.

331
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,800
-No wife this time?
-No.

332
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,320
I asked her not to come.

333
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:17,020
Since this is to be our final session,
I wanted us to be all alone.

334
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:26,960
-In silence preferably.
-Yes. Yes. I'll be a good boy.

335
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,340
I quite understand
the need for concentration.

336
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:42,960
Painting a picture is like
fighting a battle. A bloody battle.

337
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:48,980
In the gladiatorial fight to the death,
the artist either wins or loses.

338
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,480
-Are you winning?
-I hope so.

339
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,920
Do you think I'll like it?

340
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,720
I think that's possibly too much
to ask for.

341
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,460
But I do take comfort from the fact

342
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:08,140
that your own work
is so honest and revealing.

343
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:12,000
Oh, thank you for the compliment.

344
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:21,580
Well, are there any works
that you're referring to in particular?

345
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:25,140
I was thinking especially
of the Goldfish pond here at Chartwell.

346
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:32,200
-The pond? Why the pond? It's just a pond.
-It's very much more than that.

347
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:35,600
As borne out by the fact that you've
returned to it again and again.

348
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:36,980
More than 20 times.

349
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:40,380
Well, yes,
because it's such a technical challenge.

350
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:44,420
-It eludes me.
-Well, perhaps you elude yourself, sir.

351
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:48,220
That's why it's more revealing
than a self-portrait.

352
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,880
Oh, that's nonsense.

353
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:55,100
It's the water, the play of light.

354
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:59,980
The trickery. The fish, down below.

355
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,820
I think all our work
is unintentionally revealing

356
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:04,340
and I find it especially so
with your pond.

357
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,600
Beneath the tranquility and the elegance
and the light playing on the surface,

358
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:12,520
I saw honesty and pain, terrible pain.

359
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:16,660
The framing itself,
indicated to me that you wanted us

360
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,840
to see something

361
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:23,720
beneath all the muted colors,
deep down in the water.

362
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:30,660
Terrible despair. Hiding like a Leviathan.
Like a sea monster.

363
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:35,640
-You saw all that?
-Yes, I did.

364
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,160
Perhaps that says more about you than me?

365
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,980
Mm-hmm.

366
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,140
Perhaps.

367
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:49,140
May I ask you a question, Mr. Sutherland?

368
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,380
Hmm.

369
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:55,820
It's about one of your paintings.
The one you call "Pastoral."

370
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:00,540
With all that gnarled and twisted wood.

371
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,440
Those great ugly dabs of black.

372
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:10,460
I found something malevolent in it.

373
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,520
Where did that come from?

374
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:18,960
Well, that's very perceptive.
That was a very dark time. My...

375
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:25,820
My son, John, passed away,
aged two months.

376
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,480
Oh, my. I am sorry.

377
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,180
Yes. Thank you.

378
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:02,140
-You have five, yes?
-Four.

379
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,120
Marigold was the fifth.

380
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:12,440
She left us at age two years, nine months.
Septicemia.

381
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,660
I'm so sorry. I had no idea.

382
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,280
We settled on the name Marigold,

383
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:26,760
on account of her wonderful golden curls.

384
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,800
The most extraordinary color.

385
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,680
Regretfully,
but though perhaps mercifully,

386
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,680
I was not present when she died.

387
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:43,060
When I came home, Clemmie...

388
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,900
roared like a wounded animal.

389
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:01,420
We bought Chartwell
a year after Marigold died.

390
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,400
That was when I put in the...

391
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:09,980
the pond.

392
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,880
Here.

393
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,560
Thank you.

394
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,620
Well, thank you.

395
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,840
It was a pleasure.

396
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,980
I look forward to seeing it.

397
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,400
-Hello.
-Hello.

398
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:56,380
-Shall we?
-Yes.

399
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,480
Given this is Aureole's debut,
and we want to leave nothing to chance,

400
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:06,140
I've called up three different mares.

401
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:09,900
Very rarely does a forced tryst
make a fruitful tryst.

402
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,520
If one wants the perfect foal,

403
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,120
one needs to be prepared
to wait for the perfect pairing.

404
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,240
Shall we?

405
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:18,860
-Meet Neocracy.
-Oh, the Aga Khan's horse.

406
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:19,820
-Indeed.
-Yes.

407
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,220
Recently retired
with a good record as a winner.

408
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,580
Lovely temperament, too.

409
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,860
My only concern would be,

410
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,640
-is she perhaps a little too...
-Bashful?

411
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:33,240
I'm worried that if we left these two
to it, nothing would ever happen.

412
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:35,940
Which is why I've also called up
Turkish Blood.

413
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:39,340
-As you can see, an altogether different proposition.
-Indeed.

414
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,360
Strong, willful,
with a terrific track record herself.

415
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:46,420
It really would be breeding
the best with the best.

416
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,280
I'm sensing a "but".

417
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:51,680
From memory, your Aureole
is something of a sensitive soul.

418
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,320
I'd hate him to be intimidated
or come unstuck

419
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,440
when faced with a fiery warrior like this.

420
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,160
That's very considerate of you, Porchey.

421
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,960
Which is why I have a good feeling
about our third candidate.

422
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,400
Feast your eyes on Temple Bar.

423
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:06,580
A hot thoroughbred
with a winning streak herself.

424
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:09,980
She's a little on the young side, perhaps.
Just three.

425
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,160
We don't mind that, do we?

426
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:21,420
-Immediate engagement.
-Yes. I must say, I do like this one.

427
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,820
It would appear the feeling is mutual.

428
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,800
You're lovely.

429
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:32,380
Telegrams have been pouring
into Downing Street today

430
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:36,060
to wish Sir Winston Churchill,
a happy 80th birthday

431
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:38,620
on this the 30th of November.

432
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
They come from all parts of the globe.

433
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:48,480
Happy birthday, my darling old pug.

434
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,820
-Oh, is it time?
-It is, Ma'am.

435
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:44,980
Right.

436
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,640
-Do sit down, Michael.
-Thank you, Ma'am.

437
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:58,960
Westminster Hall, silent witness
of nearly a thousand years of history,

438
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:02,940
was the scene of the birthday
presentations to Sir Winston.

439
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:02,020
I am deeply honored to be here today.

440
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,400
No politician

441
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:08,560
has ever received such an honor before.

442
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:11,620
And I am deeply grateful.

443
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,280
I am aware, however,

444
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:17,160
that after having served my country,

445
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:21,980
for 54 of my 80 years...

446
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:26,660
"resignation"...

447
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:31,780
is a word that hangs in the air.

448
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:36,420
And indeed,
it is the perfect occasion for it,

449
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:40,900
and the stage is set
and the audience is assembled,

450
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:46,800
all ready for a grand valediction.

451
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:50,940
There's only one problem,
the lead actor has forgotten his lines.

452
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:57,880
And instead of standing down,
he is taking an encore.

453
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:03,180
Oh, dear, he's playing with them all.

454
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:07,180
When your political colleagues
are kind enough

455
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:12,840
to present you with a portrait
by an ambitious modernist...

456
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,600
one has to ask oneself,

457
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:20,520
"Is it a gift, or is it a curse?"

458
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:32,100
Mr. Sutherland, the artist, and I

459
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,520
spoke a great deal during my sittings.

460
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:39,440
I reminded him of the stakes involved.

461
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:43,160
That his portrait was not just of me,

462
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:47,460
but of the office I represent.

463
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:51,220
Indeed,
of our entire system of government.

464
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,480
So, at long last,

465
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:59,200
I look forward to unveiling this painting.

466
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:36,020
A fine, patriotic piece of modern art.

467
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:11,820
Why are you here?

468
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,880
I understand you've rejected the painting.

469
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,840
-I have.
-On what grounds?

470
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,160
That is not a painting.
It's a humiliation!

471
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:25,500
"How shall I paint him today?"

472
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:29,300
"Ah! Sitting on a chair,
producing a stool."

473
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:36,000
"A broken, sagging, pitiful creature,
squeezing and squeezing!"

474
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:39,780
-That's not how it's being seen.
-That is how it is.

475
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:43,540
-And I will not accept it.
-I don't think it's wise to reject it.

476
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:46,340
It was commissioned by the members
of the joint Houses of Parliament

477
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:47,420
as a sign of respect.

478
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:50,540
Well, then they should have commissioned
an artist who is respectful,

479
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:54,600
instead of a Judas
wielding his murderous brush.

480
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:59,100
Look at it!
It is a betrayal of friendship.

481
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:01,700
And an unpatriotic, treacherous,

482
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:06,000
cowardly assault
by the individualistic left.

483
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,680
-As regards the friendship...
-Clearly there is none.

484
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:13,660
I accepted this commission
because I admired you

485
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:16,420
and I came through the experience
admiring you even more.

486
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,580
You make monsters of everyone you admire?

487
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:24,400
It's not vindictive.
It's art. It's not personal.

488
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:28,940
Well, you are a lost soul.

489
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,720
A narcissist without direction
or certainty.

490
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:36,760
Please, sir.
Don't overreact. Give it time.

491
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:38,800
I showed those sketches
to your wife throughout.

492
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,840
-She remarked on how accurate they were.
-That is the whole point.

493
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:45,500
It is not a reasonably
truthful image of me!

494
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:48,800
-It is, sir.
-It is not! It is cruel!

495
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:51,100
Age is cruel!

496
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:59,220
If you see decay,
it's because there's decay.

497
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:01,780
If you see frailty,
it's because there's frailty.

498
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:06,040
I can't be blamed for what is.

499
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:11,700
And I refuse to hide
and disguise what I see.

500
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:19,460
If you're engaged in a fight with
something, then it's not with me.

501
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:26,460
It's with your own blindness.

502
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:39,100
I think you should go.

503
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:23,880
He's right.

504
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:29,560
-What?
-I am that man in the painting.

505
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,840
Wretched and decaying.

506
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:39,300
-I cannot go on.
-You've said that before.

507
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,200
This time I mean it. I'm tired.

508
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,400
You've had enough?

509
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,080
I have, my love.

510
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:01,480
This time I really have.

511
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:04,220
Good.

512
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,480
Of course, I knew it was coming.

513
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:54,060
And if I'm being frank,
there were one or two moments

514
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,280
when I might have even hoped for it, too.

515
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:59,160
Prayed, no doubt.

516
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:09,380
You really have been the most remarkable
servant to your country.

517
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:14,200
-Thank you, Ma'am.
-No, Winston, on behalf of us all...

518
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:16,520
thank you.

519
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:24,280
-And you wish for Mr. Eden to take over?
-I do.

520
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:26,440
Well, that will make him happy.

521
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:31,280
For a day or two,
he might even stop cursing me.

522
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:36,460
Then he will be overwhelmed by a job
in which no man can ever succeed,

523
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:39,500
and curse me again for leaving it to him.

524
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:44,320
It might be an idea not to tell him that
before he starts.

525
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:45,740
No, Ma'am.

526
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,000
So...

527
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:54,040
This is our last audience?

528
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:04,020
Yes.

529
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,560
However will I cope without you?

530
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:13,640
You will be fine, Ma'am.

531
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:21,100
I have nothing more to teach you.
Which is why it's time for me to leave.

532
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:32,580
Your Majesty.

533
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:25,820
Stop.

534
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:10,340
Renaming London Airport?

535
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:13,500
I want something more personal
for Winston.

536
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,200
What about dinner?

537
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:21,360
-Here? Or Buckingham Palace?
-No, there.

538
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,360
-Downing Street?
-Yes.

539
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:27,240
It would be quite the compliment.
You and Philip go there for dinner.

540
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:30,300
I'll ask Philip.

541
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:33,100
-No, you'll tell Philip.
-Mummy.

542
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:37,320
Dinner? Downing Street?
Oh, God! Why not?

543
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:41,300
Is she a looker, do you think?

544
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:45,940
I mean, if I were a stallion,
would I fancy her?

545
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:50,380
Attraction isn't so much about looks
as smell.

546
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:53,700
-Oh, I see. Well, does she smell good?
-Well, we'll see, won't we?

547
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:57,600
Come on. Come on.

548
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:05,820
Rather like us, darling,
when we were courting.

549
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:08,500
- Gently, gently, come on.
- Shh. Will you please be quiet?

550
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,960
- Yeah, look. There we go!
- All right.

551
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:15,020
All right.

552
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:20,900
- Hold her steady.
- Steady.

553
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:26,700
Oi, oi. I'll say.

554
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:33,380
Back off.

555
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:37,580
-Yes, there we go.
-Good girl.

556
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:39,580
Good boy.

557
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,200
Is that it?

558
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:46,440
2,000 guineas for that?

559
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:50,360
As long as he's done what he needs to do,
and it bears fruit, I don't mind.

560
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:52,740
Well done, Porchey!

561
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:58,840
Yes, indeed. Well done, Porchey.

562
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:01,320
I hear he's been given a direct line.

563
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,520
-Who?
-Porchey.

564
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,200
So he can call straight in.

565
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:06,720
I know only because I tried to
get one for Mike and was refused.

566
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,280
Yes.

567
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:11,780
On account of him
not being a family member.

568
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:14,940
-Porchey is like family.
-Is he?

569
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:17,860
Yes. Part of the furniture.

570
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,560
Well, as long as you don't sit on him
anytime soon.

571
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:37,300
-Well, that all seemed to go well.
-Yes, it did, didn't it?

572
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:40,380
Are you all right?

573
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:44,400
Mm.

574
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:11,980
- Can you leave us now, please?
- Yes, Ma'am.

575
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:31,360
I have nothing to hide from you. Nothing.

576
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:36,020
Porchey is a friend.

577
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:43,120
And yes, there are those
who would have preferred me to marry him.

578
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:46,340
Indeed, marriage with him
might have been easier.

579
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:50,520
Might have even worked better than ours.

580
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:56,540
But to everyone's regret
and frustration...

581
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:01,200
the only person I have ever loved is you.

582
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:07,760
And can you honestly look me in the eye
and say the same?

583
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:18,260
Can you?

584
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:37,520
Pray silence for Her Majesty, the Queen.

585
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:48,460
My Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen.

586
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:51,800
Dear Winston and Lady Churchill.

587
00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:01,280
My confidence in Sir Anthony is complete.

588
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:04,680
And I know he will lead the country
on to great achievements,

589
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:11,940
but it would be useless to pretend
that either he or any of those successors

590
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:14,700
who may one day follow him in office,

591
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:17,200
will ever, for me,

592
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:21,280
be able to hold the place
of my first Prime Minister,

593
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:24,540
to whom my husband and I owe so much.

594
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:30,260
And for whose wise guidance,
during the early years of my reign,

595
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:34,240
I shall always be so profoundly grateful.

596
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:35,780
Hear, hear!

597
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:45,140
I will remember you always
for your magnanimity,

598
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:49,000
your courage at all times.

599
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:58,520
And for your unfailing humor.

600
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:03,080
Founded in your unrivalled mastery
of the English language.

601
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:11,400
I take comfort from the fact, that
in losing my constitutional adviser...

602
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:16,360
I gain a wise counsellor...

603
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:23,020
to whom I shall look
for help and support...

604
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:25,980
in the days which lie ahead.

605
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:36,500
- May there be many of them.
- Hear, hear.
