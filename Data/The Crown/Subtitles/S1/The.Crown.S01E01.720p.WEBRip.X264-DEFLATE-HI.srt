- Bertie?
- Are you ready?

179
00:17:02,445 --> 00:17:04,405
[stifled cough]

180
00:17:04,805 --> 00:17:07,885
[Queen Elizabeth]
Everyone ready? Margaret?

181
00:17:07,965 --> 00:17:10,605
- Sir.
- Thank you.

182
00:17:13,205 --> 00:17:16,165
[crowd cheering]

183
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:30,965
Thank you.

184
00:17:41,845 --> 00:17:45,405
[crowd chanting] We want the king!
We want the king!

185
00:17:51,965 --> 00:17:54,365
[chanting continues]

186
00:18:08,925 --> 00:18:12,885
[crowd cheering]

187
00:18:56,805 --> 00:18:58,805
[rowers yelling]

188
00:18:58,885 --> 00:19:02,605
Row! Row you, bastards!

189

190
00:19:09,045 --> 00:19:14,205

[bagpipes playing]

193
00:19:30,685 --> 00:19:32,885
Everyone inside. We're starting now.

194
00:19:35,525 --> 00:19:39,685
Thank you so much for coming.
Oh, good, you're here!

195
00:19:39,765 --> 00:19:43,165
Right, come on, you two, inside.
Can't start without you.

196
00:19:43,245 --> 00:19:45,165
- Boys, come on.
- Yes, ma'am.

197
00:19:45,245 --> 00:19:47,165
Thank you. [giggles]

198
00:19:52,405 --> 00:19:53,845
[tapping on glass]

199
00:19:53,925 --> 00:19:57,405
Ladies and gentlemen, pray silence for
Her Royal Highness, Princess Elizabeth.

200
00:19:57,485 --> 00:19:58,685
Thank you, Martin.

201
00:20:00,405 --> 00:20:02,725
As I'm sure you all know,

202
00:20:02,805 --> 00:20:09,045
my dear husband will soon
no longer be Lieutenant Mountbatten

203
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:12,605
- but Lieutenant-Commander Mountbatten.
- [telephone rings]

204
00:20:12,685 --> 00:20:14,805
- [applause]
- Thank you very much.

205
00:20:16,085 --> 00:20:19,845
Which, I gather, involves a whole new
gold ring for me to sew onto your uniform!

206
00:20:19,925 --> 00:20:22,725
Half a gold ring, darling.
Half a gold ring, gentlemen.

207
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:23,845
[telephone ringing]

208
00:20:23,925 --> 00:20:29,525
So I've asked the two most important
people here to do the presentation.

209
00:20:33,925 --> 00:20:36,885
Hello? Charteris. Yes?

210
00:20:39,045 --> 00:20:41,205
- Ah.
- [laughs]

211
00:20:44,245 --> 00:20:45,525
Very good.

212
00:20:47,885 --> 00:20:50,085
There we are.
Good boy, Charles, well done!

213
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,085
- Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
- [applause]

214
00:20:52,165 --> 00:20:54,805
Important call from London, ma'am.

215
00:21:20,565 --> 00:21:23,125
[doctors talking indistinctly]

216
00:21:54,725 --> 00:21:56,005
[Elizabeth] Charles! Anne!

217
00:21:56,845 --> 00:21:58,525
[Philip] Children. Wait. Wait.

218
00:22:01,565 --> 00:22:03,565
They're waiting
in the green drawing room, ma'am.

219
00:22:03,645 --> 00:22:04,925
- Right.
- Where's grandpapa?

220
00:22:05,005 --> 00:22:06,325
He's upstairs with the doctors.

221
00:22:06,405 --> 00:22:09,165
Now, you wait with nanny
and we'll be back in a minute.

222
00:22:10,045 --> 00:22:13,005
Charles, wait. Here. Okay?

223
00:22:21,445 --> 00:22:24,005
- Mummy.
- So glad you're here.

224
00:22:24,085 --> 00:22:25,965
- We came as soon as we could.
- I know.

225
00:22:27,725 --> 00:22:29,685
- Ma'am, I'm so sorry...
- Granny.

226
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:34,245
They're operating.

227
00:22:35,165 --> 00:22:37,285
It's been two hours.

228
00:22:54,485 --> 00:22:56,445
- [door opens]
- He's here.

229
00:23:02,765 --> 00:23:04,965
I'm happy to say the procedure went well,

230
00:23:05,045 --> 00:23:09,845
and that His Majesty's immediate
post-operative condition is satisfactory.

231
00:23:09,925 --> 00:23:12,245
[sobbing]

232
00:23:15,765 --> 00:23:17,245
Thank you, doctor.

233
00:23:18,045 --> 00:23:23,925
That's good news, isn't it?
Yes. Are you all right?

234
00:24:04,565 --> 00:24:06,845
[man on radio]
<i>...after the votes are finally counted,</i>

235
00:24:06,925 --> 00:24:08,765
<i>Winston Churchill is Prime Minister</i>

236

No bacon.

239
00:24:15,045 --> 00:24:17,685
A little bacon won't hurt, surely, Gerald?
It's been five weeks.

240
00:24:17,765 --> 00:24:19,325
Let's cool this down.

241
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:26,645
And make sure that egg is well-plated
and no shell to risk irritation.

242
00:24:26,725 --> 00:24:30,165
And turn that noise off.
He'll still be prime minister tomorrow.

243
00:24:30,245 --> 00:24:31,645
- Ready?
- Ready.

244
00:24:31,725 --> 00:24:33,285
Let's get him back on his feet.

245
00:24:34,245 --> 00:24:36,805
<i>...who took office aged 83.</i>

246
00:24:36,885 --> 00:24:40,165
<i>We await the announcement
of the new Cabinet in the coming days.</i>

247
00:24:46,605 --> 00:24:47,885
Good morning, Your Majesty.

248
00:24:49,045 --> 00:24:52,725
- Your first day back at work.
- Who won?

249
00:24:53,365 --> 00:24:55,165
Who, who won?

250
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:58,965
Mr. Churchill, Your Majesty. By 17 seats.

251
00:24:59,045 --> 00:25:01,765
Good for him! You didn't hear me say that.

252
00:25:01,845 --> 00:25:03,965
[television] <i>...Mr. Winston Churchill.</i>

- [groans]

254
00:25:06,285 --> 00:25:09,725
They keep trying to count him out,

255
00:25:11,525 --> 00:25:13,485
but he keeps getting back up.

256
00:25:13,565 --> 00:25:18,725
<i>...and happy moment,
to be elected for the second time,</i>

257

[cheering on television]

259
00:25:25,445 --> 00:25:31,525
What this nation needs is several years

260
00:25:31,605 --> 00:25:37,445
of strong, steady,
experienced administration.

261
00:25:37,525 --> 00:25:39,805
[cheering and applause]

[people singing "Land of Hope and Glory"]

263
00:25:56,605 --> 00:26:00,325
Congratulations, sir.
Dr. Moran is here for you.

264
00:26:07,445 --> 00:26:11,045
Yes, you just won a General Election,
but...

265
00:26:13,885 --> 00:26:16,525
155 over 90.

266
00:26:16,605 --> 00:26:18,165
We can do better, Winston.

267
00:26:23,645 --> 00:26:25,325
Have a look at this for me, will you?

268
00:26:26,965 --> 00:26:31,325
In the war, we used mathematicians
to decode the indecipherable.

269
00:26:31,405 --> 00:26:33,765
I need an expert
to cut through the jargon.

270
00:26:36,965 --> 00:26:38,725
Are they keeping something from me?

271
00:26:40,285 --> 00:26:43,165
Well, I wouldn't be unduly concerned
about the man's pneumatics.

272
00:26:44,005 --> 00:26:46,045
And, given his age, and he's a smoker.

273
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:48,285
Catarrhal inflammation,
it's not that unusual.

274
00:26:48,365 --> 00:26:51,965
But I would be concerned
about the bronchoscopy.

275
00:26:52,045 --> 00:26:54,245
They wouldn't have done that
unless they were looking

276
00:26:54,325 --> 00:26:56,285
for something far more serious.

277
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:59,325
And they conspicuously fail
to mention the results.

278
00:27:00,605 --> 00:27:03,205
Instead they go on
about the lung resection.

279
00:27:03,285 --> 00:27:07,565
Which they performed
because of "structural alterations".

280
00:27:08,685 --> 00:27:11,765
What are structural alterations?

281
00:27:11,845 --> 00:27:14,005
It's what doctors say
when they avoid using the word

282
00:27:14,085 --> 00:27:16,725
that it almost inevitably describes.

283
00:27:19,925 --> 00:27:21,525
Who is this man?

284
00:27:29,525 --> 00:27:31,005
Just a little.

285
00:27:33,125 --> 00:27:35,565
One doesn't want to overdo it.

286
00:27:35,645 --> 00:27:38,125
One doesn't want to look ill, either.

287
00:27:38,845 --> 00:27:40,125
A sick...

288
00:27:42,565 --> 00:27:44,925
king is no good to anyone.

289
00:27:47,485 --> 00:27:49,525
There must be no weakness.

290
00:27:50,445 --> 00:27:52,365
No vulnerability.

291
00:27:55,925 --> 00:27:57,325
Oh, thank you.

[cheering]

294
00:28:28,965 --> 00:28:31,565
- What's that?
- An armchair, sir.

295
00:28:31,645 --> 00:28:35,765
- I just thought, a man of his age...
- This one never sits. Get rid of it.

296
00:28:37,845 --> 00:28:39,525
Mr. Churchill, Your Majesty.

297
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:45,845
Your Majesty.

298
00:28:47,405 --> 00:28:49,445
The people have spoken.

299
00:28:49,525 --> 00:28:53,405
Your party has won the election,

300
00:28:53,485 --> 00:28:57,045
and as... as their Sovereign,

301
00:28:57,125 --> 00:29:00,125
I invite you to form a government
in my name.

302
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:03,125
An honor I gratefully accept.

303
00:29:03,205 --> 00:29:07,245
My dear Winston. Congratulations.

304
00:29:07,325 --> 00:29:13,165
Would it be terribly unconstitutional
of me to say how happy I am?

305
00:29:14,405 --> 00:29:17,285
I've missed our weekly chats.

306
00:29:17,365 --> 00:29:19,605
[coughs]

307
00:29:20,845 --> 00:29:24,525
Your predecessor
is a fine parliamentarian.

308
00:29:25,525 --> 00:29:26,645
A good man.

309
00:29:26,725 --> 00:29:32,365
But, well, as company, as a companion...

310
00:29:33,725 --> 00:29:37,285
An empty taxi pulled up at the House
of Commons, and Mr. Attlee got out.

311
00:29:37,365 --> 00:29:40,885
[laughs] Quite.

312
00:29:42,805 --> 00:29:46,885
[sighs]
Now you may congratulate me in return.

313
00:29:46,965 --> 00:29:48,685
What for?

314
00:29:49,525 --> 00:29:51,525
My rapid recovery.

315
00:29:51,605 --> 00:29:54,325
- Oh.
- Yes.

316
00:29:54,405 --> 00:29:58,605
I seem to have bounced back
a lot quicker than people expected.

317
00:29:58,685 --> 00:30:00,405
Yes.

318
00:30:00,485 --> 00:30:04,965
Not sure I ever imagined what breathing
through one lung would feel like.

319
00:30:05,885 --> 00:30:08,685
Turns out there's barely any difference.
[chuckles]

320
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,725
Good. Good.

321
00:30:15,085 --> 00:30:20,845
Though... probably wise
to let the Princess Elizabeth

322
00:30:20,925 --> 00:30:23,805
undertake the Commonwealth tour? Hm?

323
00:30:23,885 --> 00:30:25,405
What say you?

324
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:30,445
- Is she up to it?
- Yes, I'd say so.

325
00:30:31,725 --> 00:30:37,365
Besides... we have to start
breaking her in gently, don't we?

326
00:30:37,445 --> 00:30:38,285
Do we?

327
00:30:39,445 --> 00:30:41,485
Keep one eye on the future.

328
00:30:42,765 --> 00:30:44,485
The distant future.

329
00:30:49,605 --> 00:30:53,365

[photographers shouting]

331
00:31:22,685 --> 00:31:24,845
- [man] Welcome back, sir.
- What's this?

332
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:27,285
- It's the teleprinter.
- Let's have it upstairs.

333
00:31:27,365 --> 00:31:29,405
- Everything as it was before, sir?
- Yes!

334
00:31:29,485 --> 00:31:31,565
Everything exactly as it was before.

335
00:31:31,645 --> 00:31:36,445
Ladies. Ladies. Now... Who's this?

336
00:31:37,685 --> 00:31:40,965
- Oh, Miss Venetia Scott, sir.
- A new addition.

337
00:31:41,725 --> 00:31:44,445
- A good one, I'd say.
- Thank you, sir.

338
00:31:46,325 --> 00:31:48,725
I had hoped
I'd seen the back of this place.

339
00:31:49,565 --> 00:31:52,325
Could you give us a moment,
please, Jock?

340
00:31:52,405 --> 00:31:53,405
Thank you.

341
00:31:56,245 --> 00:31:57,845
How was the king?

342
00:31:58,845 --> 00:32:04,805
He talked a great deal about his recovery.
Lots of mentions of "bouncing back".

343
00:32:04,885 --> 00:32:07,765
Which always makes one fear the worst.

344
00:32:07,845 --> 00:32:09,525
Not to mention the make-up.

345
00:32:12,605 --> 00:32:14,125
He was wearing rouge.

346
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:16,485
Poor man.

347
00:32:20,165 --> 00:32:22,005
It's cancer.

348
00:32:24,285 --> 00:32:25,325
What?

349
00:32:29,165 --> 00:32:32,565
- Who knows?
- No one.

350
00:32:34,165 --> 00:32:35,725
Least of all him.

351
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:40,805
- Sir? Lunch.
- Let's have it in here.

352
00:32:40,885 --> 00:32:44,325
See what they've been serving
for the past five years.

353
00:32:45,805 --> 00:32:49,485
- So he's dying?
- We're all dying.

354
00:32:50,325 --> 00:32:53,685
That's what defines
the condition of living.

355
00:32:53,765 --> 00:32:55,845
Will he die tomorrow? No.

356
00:32:55,925 --> 00:32:59,485
What about the day after tomorrow?
And the day after that?

357
00:32:59,565 --> 00:33:02,005
The country needs to be led
by someone strong.

358
00:33:02,085 --> 00:33:06,165
- Well, I'm strong!
- You are also tired, Winston.

359
00:33:06,245 --> 00:33:08,085
We both are.

360
00:33:08,165 --> 00:33:11,005
A situation like that
would require enormous energy.

361
00:33:13,045 --> 00:33:14,325
And I won't lie to you.

362
00:33:14,405 --> 00:33:18,285
I have considered resigning
for Anthony's sake.

363
00:33:18,365 --> 00:33:19,805
For your sake.

364
00:33:19,885 --> 00:33:25,365
But then I realized a situation like that
would also require statesmanship.

365
00:33:25,445 --> 00:33:28,325
The party needs me.
The country needs me.

366
00:33:28,405 --> 00:33:29,965
She needs me.

367
00:33:30,045 --> 00:33:32,805
- Who?
- Her!

368
00:33:34,685 --> 00:33:35,645
Oh, her.

369
00:33:38,405 --> 00:33:41,285
[Philip] This is Clarence House
dining room to Clarence House kitchen.

370
00:33:41,365 --> 00:33:42,805
Dining room to kitchen.

371
00:33:44,365 --> 00:33:47,445
- [Charles] Dining room to kitchen!
- Yes. Dining room to kitchen!

372
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:48,525
Oh, bugger it!

373
00:33:48,605 --> 00:33:51,885
Right, check the circuits
and up the amperage of the fuse wire.

374
00:33:51,965 --> 00:33:53,565
Right, I'm off.

375
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:56,405
- Breakfast with your mother?
- And Margaret.

376
00:33:56,485 --> 00:33:59,725
Imagine.
I'm checking curtain fabrics in an hour.

377
00:33:59,805 --> 00:34:02,165
- [laughs]
- [Philip] Yes.

378
00:34:05,725 --> 00:34:06,885
Let's pick the curtains.

379
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:10,125
- Where to, ma'am?
- Buckingham Palace, please.

380
00:34:13,605 --> 00:34:14,645
Buckingham Palace.

381
00:34:22,725 --> 00:34:24,605
- I see.
- [knock at door]

382
00:34:24,685 --> 00:34:26,125
[man] The queen has asked to see you.

383
00:34:27,045 --> 00:34:29,405
Yes, we look forward
to seeing the doctor then.

384
00:34:29,485 --> 00:34:31,845
- Thank you. Goodbye.
- Drawing room!

385
00:34:31,925 --> 00:34:33,845
- Now?
- Yes.

386
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:43,365
We do both so love
living at Clarence House

387
00:34:43,445 --> 00:34:46,565
and he has all sorts of ideas
about how to modernize it.

388
00:34:46,645 --> 00:34:48,725
He really is rather ingenious like that,
actually.

389
00:34:48,805 --> 00:34:51,965
- Now, Peter.
- Your Majesty. Your Royal Highnesses.

390
00:34:52,045 --> 00:34:54,525
I have to make a decision
about Christmas.

391
00:34:54,605 --> 00:34:58,445
Tell me, do you think the King will be
well enough to go to Sandringham?

392
00:34:58,525 --> 00:35:01,005
I do. As a matter of fact,
I think it would do him good.

393
00:35:01,845 --> 00:35:04,805
- So it's decided.
- Will you be joining us, too?

394
00:35:06,405 --> 00:35:07,245
Me?

395
00:35:08,605 --> 00:35:12,285
Course not. Peter will be spending
Christmas at home with his family.

396
00:35:12,365 --> 00:35:14,365
I was only thinking of papa.

397
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:17,005
Given the choice, you know
he'd never let him out of his sight.

398
00:35:17,085 --> 00:35:18,805
Well, that's true.

399
00:35:18,885 --> 00:35:22,685
- He's quite devoted to you.
- Then let me discuss it with Rosemary.

400
00:35:22,765 --> 00:35:25,725
Oh, no. No, it's out of the question.

401
00:35:25,805 --> 00:35:30,285
Why, mummy? Let Peter discuss it.

402
00:35:32,805 --> 00:35:34,685
- Well, he did offer.
- Oh, very well.

403
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:35,765
[bell rings]

404
00:35:35,845 --> 00:35:38,285
But, as a wife,
I know what my answer would be.

405
00:35:38,365 --> 00:35:41,805
I'd want my husband at home
at Christmas with his children.

406
00:35:41,885 --> 00:35:42,965
Excuse me.

407
00:35:56,045 --> 00:35:57,485
I saw that.

408
00:35:58,765 --> 00:36:01,885
What? No, I haven't finished.

409
00:36:01,965 --> 00:36:03,725
That look between the two of you.

410
00:36:06,405 --> 00:36:10,405
- Oh, Margaret!
- You must tell no one.

411
00:36:10,485 --> 00:36:13,525
The papers all think I'm for
Johnny Dalkeith or Billy Wallace.

412
00:36:13,605 --> 00:36:17,405
- Mummy and Papa, too, by the way.
- They're just boys. Whereas Peter is...

413
00:36:17,485 --> 00:36:20,205
No, I quite see the attraction of Peter.

414
00:36:20,285 --> 00:36:21,445
But he's married.

415
00:36:34,565 --> 00:36:37,245
[knock at door, door opens]

416
00:36:39,005 --> 00:36:40,765
Doctor Weir, Your Majesty.

417
00:36:48,325 --> 00:36:51,045
You told me that, after the operation,

418
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:56,005
I might expect some... soreness,

419
00:36:56,085 --> 00:37:00,525
some difficulty breathing.

420
00:37:00,605 --> 00:37:04,765
But you didn't tell me about this.

421
00:37:06,165 --> 00:37:07,885
- The coughing has returned?
- Yes.

422
00:37:07,965 --> 00:37:09,925
- How often?
- All the time.

423
00:37:12,125 --> 00:37:18,125
At the time of the operation, as you know,
structural alterations were discovered.

424
00:37:18,205 --> 00:37:20,405
Of course. The blockage in the lung.

425
00:37:21,925 --> 00:37:24,405
It's time we gave that blockage a name,
sir.

426
00:37:25,805 --> 00:37:27,965
It was a tumor.

427
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:29,165
A malignant tumor.

428
00:37:36,725 --> 00:37:38,205
I see.

429
00:37:41,005 --> 00:37:45,005
- But... we removed it?
- We did.

430
00:37:46,045 --> 00:37:48,245
So what is this?

431
00:37:48,325 --> 00:37:51,405
We removed the left lung, sir.
But the right...

432
00:37:53,085 --> 00:37:57,965
has fewer,
but still significant, blockages.

433
00:38:13,205 --> 00:38:14,325
So, what's next?

434
00:38:16,325 --> 00:38:17,205
Next?

435
00:38:23,165 --> 00:38:27,245
I argued that His Majesty
should be told at the time.

436
00:38:27,325 --> 00:38:30,525
A patient has a right
to know the full picture.

437
00:38:30,605 --> 00:38:33,765
But I was overruled. The theory was that,
if His Majesty felt he'd been cured,

438
00:38:33,845 --> 00:38:38,445
he could throw himself into his work
without undue stress and, and, and worry.

439
00:38:56,285 --> 00:38:58,485
I have two questions.

440
00:39:00,485 --> 00:39:02,445
Who knows the full picture?

441
00:39:04,085 --> 00:39:05,565
Apart from the surgeons?

442
00:39:06,725 --> 00:39:08,645
Perhaps the Prime Minister, sir.

443
00:39:14,205 --> 00:39:15,205
Of course.

444
00:39:18,245 --> 00:39:20,205
But not the queen?

445
00:39:21,885 --> 00:39:25,205
- Nor anyone else in my family?
- No, sir.

446
00:39:31,205 --> 00:39:33,325
And the second question?

447
00:39:38,445 --> 00:39:40,565
It's impossible to say, sir.

448
00:39:41,565 --> 00:39:45,685
My understanding is the surgeons
did everything they could.

449
00:39:48,405 --> 00:39:49,845
And?

450
00:39:51,845 --> 00:39:53,645
It could be years.

451
00:39:55,045 --> 00:39:57,445
More likely months.

452
00:40:00,805 --> 00:40:02,285

Ma'am, His Majesty has requested
you attend him in his study.

Urgently requested, ma'am.

490
00:44:19,645 --> 00:44:20,485
Alright.

491
00:44:21,685 --> 00:44:23,365
Will you take them?

492
00:44:23,445 --> 00:44:24,445
I'll be back soon.

In case you're wondering,
I haven't anything specific to say.

00:44:43,085 --> 00:44:45,005

Oh, the boxes.

Not if you keep on top of them.

- Even at Christmas.
- Even at Christmas.

00:45:11,685 --> 00:45:13,485
Well, what's inside?

503
00:45:13,565 --> 00:45:17,045
Everything they want me to know,
they stick on top.

Everything they'd rather I didn't know,

Cabinet meetings,
Foreign Office briefings,

506
00:45:23,285 --> 00:45:25,525
they tuck away at the bottom.

507
00:45:25,605 --> 00:45:31,925
Which is why... the first thing I do
when no one is looking, is this.

Don't you get sick of it all?

516
00:46:17,885 --> 00:46:19,805
[sighs] I do.

Sometimes.

519
00:46:27,965 --> 00:46:31,725
Which is why it's so important
to have the right person by your side.

520
00:46:33,045 --> 00:46:35,645
I've been very lucky in that regard
with your mother.

524
00:46:47,525 --> 00:46:51,725
Well, I'm afraid he's become something
of a snagaholic.

00:46:52,885 --> 00:46:57,085

House to make it our permanent home?

00:46:57,165 --> 00:46:58,125
Mm, yes.

528
00:46:58,205 --> 00:47:00,925
Well, ever since he started
supervising the work,

529
00:47:01,005 --> 00:47:03,965
he can't look at anything
without seeing its faults.

530
00:47:04,045 --> 00:47:08,765
"That switch is an inch too high.
And that door handle's wrong."

531
00:47:08,845 --> 00:47:11,805
"Well, don't be silly," I say.
"A handle's a handle."

532
00:47:11,885 --> 00:47:13,565
I should make more of an effort with him.

533
00:47:15,845 --> 00:47:17,365
Take him shooting.

534
00:47:17,445 --> 00:47:19,965
- Would he like that?
- Yes, I think he'd love it.

535
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:22,725
And then when your health's improved,
we'll return to Malta

536
00:47:22,805 --> 00:47:26,125
and he'll have his navy again,
and all will be well.

537
00:47:26,205 --> 00:47:27,605
Of course.

538
00:47:28,725 --> 00:47:34,765
But, in the meantime...
I'm still not yet well enough to travel.

539
00:47:34,845 --> 00:47:38,085
Not long distances, anyway.

540
00:47:38,165 --> 00:47:41,725
Which brings me
to the forthcoming Commonwealth tour.

541
00:47:41,805 --> 00:47:46,125
I was wondering if you would consider
stepping into my shoes, so to speak.

542
00:47:47,485 --> 00:47:52,765
My health is improving
but I'm still not yet well enough.

543
00:47:53,805 --> 00:47:57,845
- Well, if you think we're up to it.
- You'll be fine.

544
00:47:59,525 --> 00:48:02,205
- Where is it?
- Well...

545
00:48:02,285 --> 00:48:05,005
Ceylon. Australia.

546
00:48:05,085 --> 00:48:07,725
Then on to New Zealand. Bermuda.

547
00:48:07,805 --> 00:48:10,085
And there's talk of starting in Kenya.

548
00:48:10,165 --> 00:48:11,845
Very good!

549
00:48:11,925 --> 00:48:13,565
Right, we'll be gone months.

550
00:48:15,285 --> 00:48:18,605
Yes. But it would mean so much
to papa that we do it.

551
00:48:18,685 --> 00:48:23,325
- What am I supposed to do all that time?
- Don't worry, we'll put you to work.

552
00:48:23,405 --> 00:48:25,205
My work is as a naval officer,

553
00:48:25,285 --> 00:48:28,205
not grinning like a demented ape
while you cut ribbons!

554
00:48:28,285 --> 00:48:31,725
- What about the children?
- The children will be fine.

555
00:48:31,805 --> 00:48:35,485
Oh! Without their parents
for months on end?

556
00:48:35,565 --> 00:48:38,925
- Daddy, can you come and play?
- I won't be a moment, darling.

557
00:48:39,005 --> 00:48:41,485
If you go and play with grandpapa,
I'll be right over. Good boy.

558
00:48:41,565 --> 00:48:44,485
[Queen Elizabeth] Come on, darling,
Daddy's busy. Come and start again.

559
00:48:44,565 --> 00:48:46,805
- [Charles] Daddy's coming.
- They won't know.

560
00:48:46,885 --> 00:48:49,245
- They're too young to notice.
- Come on. Be quiet.

561
00:48:49,325 --> 00:48:51,405
It would so help in papa's recovery.

562
00:48:54,005 --> 00:48:55,965
[King George] Charles, come back here.

563
00:48:56,045 --> 00:48:59,165
- [Charles] Daddy, can you play now?
- [King George] Charles.

564
00:49:05,405 --> 00:49:06,365
Yes.

565
00:49:09,845 --> 00:49:10,805
Thank you.

566
00:49:10,885 --> 00:49:13,685
- [Philip] What are we playing?
- [Charles] Granny's footsteps.

567
00:49:13,765 --> 00:49:15,885
[Philip] Come on then. Let's go.
And then it's bedtime.

568
00:49:15,965 --> 00:49:18,125
[Queen Elizabeth] Ready, steady...

569
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:20,485
[bagpipes playing]

570
00:49:25,885 --> 00:49:29,845
[coughing]

571
00:49:39,645 --> 00:49:40,685
Sir?

572
00:49:52,565 --> 00:49:57,445
- What's the weather like today?
- Rather misty at the moment, sir.

573
00:49:58,765 --> 00:50:02,285
- Morning!
- Bugger off!

574
00:50:03,805 --> 00:50:09,245
Yes, I'm not sure that's the correct
address for the King of England.

575
00:50:09,325 --> 00:50:12,005
- It's a beautiful morning for duck.
- What?

576
00:50:12,085 --> 00:50:14,685
I thought Wolferton Splash.

577
00:50:20,565 --> 00:50:21,605
Christ.

578
00:50:25,165 --> 00:50:27,205
[breathless laugh]

579
00:50:29,005 --> 00:50:31,325
- [ducks quacking]
- Reed warbler, see?

580
00:50:33,125 --> 00:50:37,165
Oh, Teal. Below the withy there.

581
00:50:37,245 --> 00:50:41,405
When I woke up this morning, I thought
we'd go to Babingley Flat or Eleven Acres.

582
00:50:41,485 --> 00:50:44,365
But, in the end,
there's nowhere better than the Splash

583
00:50:44,445 --> 00:50:47,605
with a bagful of cartridges
to lift the spirits.

584
00:50:47,685 --> 00:50:49,645
His Majesty's back to himself again.

585
00:50:49,725 --> 00:50:53,005
Oh, he is, thank you.
Like a young man again.

586
00:50:53,085 --> 00:50:54,605
[coughs]

587
00:50:59,725 --> 00:51:00,685
[laughs]

588
00:51:01,645 --> 00:51:04,125
We'll be all right.
My son-in-law's a naval man.

589
00:51:04,205 --> 00:51:07,085
We will. If I can handle a frigate.

590
00:51:23,285 --> 00:51:28,125
You understand, the titles,
the... dukedom.

591
00:51:29,925 --> 00:51:32,725
- They're not the job.
- Sir?

592
00:51:36,245 --> 00:51:38,125
She is the job.

593
00:51:39,645 --> 00:51:43,085
She is the essence of your duty.

594
00:51:44,485 --> 00:51:45,685
Loving her.

595
00:51:47,405 --> 00:51:49,165
Protecting her.

596
00:51:53,085 --> 00:51:54,965
Of course, you'll miss your career.

597
00:51:57,685 --> 00:52:01,445
But doing this for her,
doing this for me...

598
00:52:05,005 --> 00:52:07,765
there may be no greater act of patriotism.

599
00:52:09,485 --> 00:52:10,605
Or love.

600
00:52:15,645 --> 00:52:17,165
I understand, sir.

601
00:52:19,685 --> 00:52:20,845
Do you, boy?

602
00:52:22,525 --> 00:52:24,285
Do you really?

603
00:52:29,285 --> 00:52:30,805
I think so.

604
00:52:40,965 --> 00:52:43,165
Come.

605
00:52:43,245 --> 00:52:45,645
Let's go shoot some duck, shall we?

606
00:52:45,725 --> 00:52:47,245
Three cheers for His Majesty!

607
00:52:47,325 --> 00:52:49,325
- Hip, hip!
- [all] Hooray!

608
00:52:49,405 --> 00:52:51,325
- Hip, hip!
- [all] Hooray!

609
00:52:51,405 --> 00:52:53,085
- Hip, hip!
- [all] Hooray!

610
00:52:53,165 --> 00:52:55,605
[King George] You're too kind. Thank you.

611
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:10,965
[coughs]

612
00:53:19,685 --> 00:53:22,845
- [men talking]
- [dogs bark]

613
00:53:28,325 --> 00:53:31,405
- [gunshots]
- [ducks quacking]

614
00:53:40,805 --> 00:53:44,205
- [gunshots]
- [men shouting]

615
00:54:12,685 --> 00:54:16,205
[coughing]

616
00:54:34,885 --> 00:54:36,565
[gunshots]

617
00:54:55,539 --> 00:55:00,539
