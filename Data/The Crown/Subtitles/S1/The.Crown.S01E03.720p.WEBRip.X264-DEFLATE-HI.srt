[man] <i>Hello, Winston, this is Operations.</i>

10
00:01:01,525 --> 00:01:03,885
- <i>Are you hearing me?</i>
- Hear you clearly.

11
00:01:03,965 --> 00:01:05,525
<i>Stand by for testing.</i>

12
00:01:06,365 --> 00:01:09,045
- Testing now.
- <i>Testing five, four, three, two, one.</i>

[dogs bark]

14
00:01:22,645 --> 00:01:23,685
Mummy.

15
00:01:24,485 --> 00:01:27,885
I've come to make a final representation.

16
00:01:27,965 --> 00:01:30,805
And to beseech you not to do this.

17
00:01:30,885 --> 00:01:33,885
I wish to address my people.
It's my right.

18
00:01:33,965 --> 00:01:36,805
You have forfeited that right.

19
00:01:36,885 --> 00:01:38,405
There are things I wish to say.

20
00:01:38,485 --> 00:01:41,645
In which capacity?
You're no longer their king.

21
00:01:41,725 --> 00:01:43,085
As a private individual.

22
00:01:43,165 --> 00:01:45,725
Oh, no one wants to hear
from a private individual.

23
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:48,365
Well, I beg to differ.
The newspapers are for me.

24
00:01:48,445 --> 00:01:51,525
The best thing for everyone
would be if you said your goodbyes

25
00:01:51,605 --> 00:01:55,725
quietly, privately,
and disappeared into the night.

26
00:01:55,805 --> 00:01:57,605
Preferably never to return.

27
00:01:59,765 --> 00:02:02,365
- I didn't say that.
- But you thought it.

28
00:02:04,285 --> 00:02:05,405
Admit it.

29
00:02:13,725 --> 00:02:18,765
Elizabeth! Margaret! Come inside!

00:02:18,845 --> 00:02:21,005
[man on radio] <i>This is Windsor Castle.</i>

31
00:02:21,085 --> 00:02:25,205
<i>There follows an important announcement
from his Royal Highness,</i>

32
00:02:25,285 --> 00:02:26,565
<i>the Duke of Windsor.</i>

33
00:02:26,645 --> 00:02:31,525
A few hours ago, I discharged my last duty

34
00:02:31,605 --> 00:02:34,845
as King and Emperor.

35
00:02:37,005 --> 00:02:39,885
And, now that I have been succeeded
by my brother,

36
00:02:40,965 --> 00:02:42,605
the Duke of York,

37
00:02:43,885 --> 00:02:48,125
my first words must be to declare
my allegiance to him.

38
00:02:50,565 --> 00:02:52,565
This I do with all my heart.

39
00:02:53,525 --> 00:02:55,045
- [girls laugh]
- Come along, girls.

40
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:59,565
<i>You all know the reasons which have
impelled me to renounce the throne.</i>

41
00:02:59,645 --> 00:03:01,925
- <i>I have found it impossible to carry...</i>
- Girls. Girls!

42
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:07,685
<i>...the heavy burden of responsibility,
and to discharge my duties as King,</i>

43
00:03:07,765 --> 00:03:11,645
as I would wish to do,

44
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:17,205
without the help and support
of the woman I love.

45
00:03:17,285 --> 00:03:21,045
<i>This decision has been made less difficult
to me by the sure knowledge</i>

46
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:25,005
<i>that my brother
has one matchless blessing...</i>

47
00:03:25,085 --> 00:03:28,845
- Come in. Both of you.
- <i>...enjoyed by so many of you,</i>

48
00:03:28,925 --> 00:03:30,925
<i>and not bestowed on me.</i>

49
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:36,325
<i>A happy home, with his wife and children.</i>

50
00:03:38,045 --> 00:03:39,925
<i>And now we all have a new king.</i>

51
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:48,085
<i>I wish him, and you, his people,
happiness and prosperity...</i>

52
00:03:50,645 --> 00:03:52,285
<i>with all my heart.</i>

53
00:03:53,445 --> 00:03:55,045
<i>God bless you all.</i>

54
00:03:56,325 --> 00:03:58,685
<i>God save the King.</i>

[vacuum cleaner running]

57
00:06:10,605 --> 00:06:12,565
All right, Charles, all right. Stop it.

58
00:06:17,005 --> 00:06:19,965
Well... good luck, darling.

59
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,165
Thank you.

60
00:06:24,525 --> 00:06:27,845
And thank you for all this.
It looks splendid.

61
00:06:29,045 --> 00:06:31,685
This is the first proper home
I've ever had.

62
00:07:04,485 --> 00:07:06,005
[cameras click]

63
00:07:47,805 --> 00:07:49,565
- Tommy.
- Good morning, Your Majesty.

64
00:07:49,645 --> 00:07:51,805
- You tracked me down.
- Slightly, ma'am.

65
00:07:51,885 --> 00:07:53,525
If Your Majesty has no objection,

66
00:07:53,605 --> 00:07:55,525
I thought we might attend
to the Cabinet papers

67
00:07:55,605 --> 00:07:59,645
after your meeting with Their Majesties.
Your schedule allows for 20 minutes.

68
00:07:59,725 --> 00:08:01,325
- For the papers?
- No, ma'am,

69
00:08:01,405 --> 00:08:04,885
20 minutes with Their Majesties,
then directly on to the paperwork.

70
00:08:04,965 --> 00:08:06,325
And then?

71
00:08:07,885 --> 00:08:10,845
Things will become more manageable
once everything settles down.

72
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:11,765
Will it?

73
00:08:11,845 --> 00:08:15,125
And once the Palace
is your main residence.

74
00:08:17,165 --> 00:08:21,085
[Norfolk] Our understanding is that he is
arriving at Southampton as we speak.

75
00:08:21,165 --> 00:08:23,285
- [Queen Mary] Alone?
- We believe so, ma'am.

76
00:08:23,365 --> 00:08:25,405
Hm. That's something.

77
00:08:30,365 --> 00:08:33,725
[Norfolk] Some last minute adjustments
to the funeral arrangements.

78
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:37,285
If you are in agreement, ma'am,
we thought that the Duke of Windsor

79
00:08:37,365 --> 00:08:40,405
should join the Dukes of Gloucester,
Kent and Edinburgh.

80
00:08:40,485 --> 00:08:44,165
But that'd be the row behind me.
Breathing down my neck.

81
00:08:44,245 --> 00:08:46,805
We could, if Her Majesty likes,
increase the distance,

82
00:08:46,885 --> 00:08:48,405
put him back a few rows.

83
00:08:48,485 --> 00:08:52,045
Any chance that could stretch
to being on the steps outside the chapel?

84
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,525
I'm sorry, I know he's your son.

85
00:08:54,605 --> 00:08:58,645
A son who gave up the throne
and, effectively, killed my other son.

86
00:09:07,925 --> 00:09:10,925
Why not put him there?
Close to the Prime Minister?

87
00:09:11,925 --> 00:09:13,925
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Cry Baby.

88
00:09:14,965 --> 00:09:17,005
- What?
- It's what he calls Winston.

89
00:09:18,445 --> 00:09:21,485
He and his wife have
nasty little nicknames for all of us.

90
00:09:22,925 --> 00:09:25,325
I'll tell you yours, if you ask me nicely.

91
00:09:25,405 --> 00:09:26,965
No, thank you.

92
00:09:28,885 --> 00:09:30,805
Shirley Temple.

93
00:09:34,685 --> 00:09:38,125

00:09:39,885 --> 00:09:42,965
[ship horn blaring]

95
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:53,325
Ready, sir.

96
00:10:04,965 --> 00:10:08,965
[Duke of Windsor] <i>This is indeed
a sad arrival in my country.</i>

97
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:15,925
<i>I have crossed the Atlantic
for the funeral of a dear brother,</i>

98
00:10:16,005 --> 00:10:19,325
<i>and to comfort Her Majesty, Queen Mary.</i>

99
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:24,405
My heart goes out
to the widowed Queen Mother

100
00:10:24,485 --> 00:10:27,885
and her two daughters in their grief.

101
00:10:29,365 --> 00:10:30,565
Thank you.

102
00:10:30,645 --> 00:10:34,285
[crowd shouting]

103
00:10:52,925 --> 00:10:55,765
- Down there, look!
- Right, that's enough. Look sharp!

104
00:11:31,365 --> 00:11:33,925
His Royal Highness,
the Duke of Windsor, Your Majesty.

105
00:11:51,685 --> 00:11:53,205
Dear Mama.

106
00:12:13,485 --> 00:12:14,565
Poor Bertie.

107
00:12:16,285 --> 00:12:17,365
So young.

108
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:23,205
One can only be thankful
for all the years one had him.

109
00:12:25,605 --> 00:12:29,165
So wonderfully thoughtful and caring.

110
00:12:29,245 --> 00:12:32,805
An angel to his mother, wife and children.

111
00:12:34,405 --> 00:12:38,085
I honestly believe
he never thought of himself at all.

112
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:43,325
He really was the perfect son.

113
00:12:46,685 --> 00:12:49,325
I can't imagine how difficult
it must be for you.

114
00:12:51,205 --> 00:12:53,965
You've been very much
in our thoughts and prayers.

115
00:12:54,045 --> 00:12:55,245
Ours?

116
00:12:56,165 --> 00:12:59,165
You'd be wise not to mention
that woman's name for the next few days.

117
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:02,005
- I mentioned no name.
- The implication was enough.

118
00:13:02,085 --> 00:13:03,605
If you say so.

119
00:13:03,685 --> 00:13:07,085
I offer that in the spirit
of maternal advice

120
00:13:07,165 --> 00:13:11,645
that you may emerge from this trip with
any remaining respect or affection at all.

121
00:13:24,485 --> 00:13:27,405
I had hoped all this might wait.

122
00:13:27,485 --> 00:13:29,885
I'm afraid not, ma'am.

123
00:13:33,645 --> 00:13:34,965
I understand.

124
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:37,725
Shall we?

125
00:13:53,805 --> 00:13:59,485
Now, the top sheet is simply a summary
of all the contents of the box.

126
00:13:59,565 --> 00:14:03,765
And we have in this case,
a five power conference first. See...

127
00:14:03,845 --> 00:14:05,725
- That's this one?
- Yes.

128
00:14:05,805 --> 00:14:08,365
- So this...
- More detail.

129
00:14:08,445 --> 00:14:10,885
- So, we start with this.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

130
00:14:10,965 --> 00:14:14,565
[conversation continues indistinctly]

131
00:14:28,645 --> 00:14:31,485
- [Philip] He's here.
- He's here!

132
00:14:33,765 --> 00:14:38,525
Don't rush, darling. It'll take him
an hour to get to the front door.

133
00:14:38,605 --> 00:14:40,645
And then an hour to get through
the bloody thing!

134
00:14:44,645 --> 00:14:47,125
Now, don't forget
the two things we discussed.

135
00:14:47,205 --> 00:14:49,165
- I won't.
- The children keeping my surname.

136
00:14:49,245 --> 00:14:51,245
- Yes.
- And us staying here in Clarence House,

137
00:14:51,325 --> 00:14:53,765
not moving to Buckingham Palace.
Both very important.

138
00:14:53,845 --> 00:14:54,925
I know. I won't forget.

139
00:14:55,005 --> 00:14:56,845
- And don't be nervous.
- I'm not nervous.

140
00:14:56,925 --> 00:14:57,965
You look nervous.

141
00:14:59,085 --> 00:15:00,525
Be firm. Just lay down the law.

142
00:15:00,605 --> 00:15:03,325
I know he's Winston Churchill
and all that, but remember who you are.

143
00:15:03,405 --> 00:15:04,285
- You're...
- Nobody.

144
00:15:04,365 --> 00:15:05,725
The Queen of England.

145
00:15:12,765 --> 00:15:14,325
[toy horn honks]

146
00:15:21,405 --> 00:15:23,805
[Churchill] Don't let me overrun.

147
00:15:23,885 --> 00:15:25,565
[man] The Prime Minister, Your Majesty.

148
00:15:44,725 --> 00:15:45,925
Your Majesty.

149
00:15:50,725 --> 00:15:54,925
I so looked forward every Tuesday
to my audiences with your...

150
00:15:56,645 --> 00:15:57,765
dear papa.

151
00:15:59,645 --> 00:16:02,765
His late Majesty was a hero

152
00:16:04,605 --> 00:16:06,525
to me and to all his people.

153
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,165
Thank you.

154
00:16:11,765 --> 00:16:14,045
Do sit down, Prime Minister.

155
00:16:15,085 --> 00:16:19,285
I've ordered tea.
Or something stronger, perhaps.

156
00:16:19,365 --> 00:16:21,725
Oh, dear. Did no one explain?

157
00:16:21,805 --> 00:16:28,725
The Sovereign never offers
a Prime Minister refreshment.

158
00:16:28,805 --> 00:16:30,685
Nor a chair.

159
00:16:30,765 --> 00:16:33,445
The precedent set
by your great-great-grandmother

160
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:37,845
was to keep us standing
like Privy Councillors.

161
00:16:37,925 --> 00:16:41,525
To waste time is a grievous sin.

162
00:16:41,605 --> 00:16:44,645
And, if there is one thing I have learned
in 52 years of public service,

163
00:16:44,725 --> 00:16:50,525
it is that there is no problem so complex,
nor crisis so grave,

164
00:16:50,605 --> 00:16:56,605
that it cannot be satisfactorily resolved
within 20 minutes. So...

165
00:16:58,325 --> 00:17:00,085
shall we make a start?

166
00:17:02,085 --> 00:17:03,685
[Philip] <i>She's in with the PM now.</i>

167
00:17:04,325 --> 00:17:06,805
And I made it abundantly clear
how important it was

168
00:17:06,885 --> 00:17:09,525
that she and the children take your name.

169
00:17:09,605 --> 00:17:13,565
[Lord Mountbatten] <i>It's your name too.
It's the name I gave you.</i>

170
00:17:15,165 --> 00:17:20,205
Having Mountbatten
as the name of the Royal house,

171
00:17:20,285 --> 00:17:25,405
having your first-born son, Charles,
as the first Mountbatten king...

172
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:29,125
<i>Well, that would be some achievement,
wouldn't it?</i>

173
00:17:30,165 --> 00:17:34,525
Now, I would like to discuss
your coronation.

174
00:17:34,605 --> 00:17:35,485
Yes.

175
00:17:35,565 --> 00:17:39,365
I have a proposed date which has been
run past Cabinet and approved.

176
00:17:39,445 --> 00:17:44,525
- Summer, I hope.
- Indeed. Next year.

177
00:17:45,285 --> 00:17:47,645
Next year? Why the delay?

178
00:17:49,245 --> 00:17:51,765
For your benefit entirely.

179
00:17:51,845 --> 00:17:55,405
A long period
between accession and coronation

180
00:17:55,485 --> 00:17:57,885
was of great value to your father.

181
00:17:57,965 --> 00:18:00,525
He had five months.

182
00:18:00,605 --> 00:18:04,325
You're proposing I have 16
before I am crowned.

183
00:18:06,605 --> 00:18:07,645
Yes.

184
00:18:11,085 --> 00:18:14,685
[man] That would take anyone
weeks to read...

185
00:18:14,765 --> 00:18:18,885
- Anyway, thanks for the drink.
- Thank you, Jock.

186
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:20,365
- Sir.
- Sir.

187
00:18:23,245 --> 00:18:26,125
Foreign office first,
let's surprise Anthony.

188
00:18:29,685 --> 00:18:31,405
- [Philip] And?
- Nothing.

189
00:18:32,765 --> 00:18:35,765
We discussed the end of rationing
of sugar, butter and meat,

190
00:18:35,845 --> 00:18:39,285
the situation in Korea,
and the date of my coronation.

191
00:18:39,365 --> 00:18:40,485
I barely got a word in.

192
00:18:40,565 --> 00:18:42,485
Of course not,
the man barely draws breath.

193
00:18:42,565 --> 00:18:44,845
- You have to butt in.
- You can't!

194
00:18:44,925 --> 00:18:46,805
Not in the private audience.

195
00:18:46,885 --> 00:18:50,005
So, what about the issues
I asked you to address?

196
00:18:50,085 --> 00:18:52,405
- I will find the right time.
- When?

197
00:18:52,485 --> 00:18:54,285
- Why would he do that?
- What?

198
00:18:55,045 --> 00:18:56,885
Why would he want to delay my coronation?

199
00:18:56,965 --> 00:19:00,485
What are you talking about? What...
Elizabeth!

200
00:19:15,245 --> 00:19:17,045
[telephone rings in distance]

201
00:19:19,485 --> 00:19:21,045
[doors close]

202
00:19:28,045 --> 00:19:31,565
I realize we've had our differences
in the past.

203
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:34,805
If you'll allow me.

204
00:19:36,445 --> 00:19:41,445
But, for now, let us think only
of what we have in common.

205
00:19:42,965 --> 00:19:47,805
You've lost a husband and father,

206
00:19:48,725 --> 00:19:50,325
I a brother.

207
00:19:51,805 --> 00:19:58,805
Let us be united in grief,
on equal terms, for someone we all loved.

208
00:20:01,245 --> 00:20:04,685
I'll be here for a few days
after the funeral

209
00:20:04,765 --> 00:20:06,685
before I return to New York.

210
00:20:07,885 --> 00:20:11,365
Perhaps we might find time
to see one another.

211
00:20:11,445 --> 00:20:13,685
For lunch, or a walk.

212
00:20:16,805 --> 00:20:19,285
Yes. I'd like that very much.

213
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,605
[door opens]

214
00:20:27,165 --> 00:20:28,685
Your Majesties.

215
00:20:28,765 --> 00:20:32,045
- [Queen Mother] We must go, girls.
- So soon?

216
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:34,365
Yes, to Westminster Hall.

217
00:20:34,445 --> 00:20:35,965
To see Papa.

218
00:20:49,645 --> 00:20:52,605
With this family, when you're in,
you're never quite sure that you're in.

219
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:55,325
But when you're out,
there's no doubt at all.

220
00:20:55,405 --> 00:20:56,925
You're out.

221
00:21:01,005 --> 00:21:02,965
[sobs]

222
00:21:03,045 --> 00:21:05,325
Why can't you just be civil to him, Mummy?

223
00:21:05,405 --> 00:21:08,165
Let bygones be bygones.

224
00:21:08,245 --> 00:21:12,165
Sixteen years since the abdication,
and he was close to Papa.

225
00:21:12,245 --> 00:21:14,725
Because the man is a monster!

226
00:21:14,805 --> 00:21:17,405
The responsibility of becoming king
killed your father

227
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:22,445
and I will never forgive his selfishness
and weakness in passing on the burden.

228
00:21:25,725 --> 00:21:28,805
He has done nothing for this family.

229
00:21:29,525 --> 00:21:32,045
And don't be fooled by his obsequiousness.

230
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:36,605
The only reason he's even civil to us
is because he wants to leech off us

231
00:21:36,685 --> 00:21:40,085
with a rich allowance to keep
that Jezebel divorcee of his in the manner

232
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:41,645
to which she's become accustomed.

233
00:21:41,725 --> 00:21:43,365
Well, I've spoken to the lawyers

234
00:21:43,445 --> 00:21:46,245
and we have a little surprise
in store for them.

235
00:21:49,205 --> 00:21:51,085
[Duke of Windsor]
<i>My dear darling Peaches...</i>

236
00:21:52,485 --> 00:21:54,525
<i>They say hell is an inferno.</i>

237
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:59,485
<i>What a sunless, frozen hell
we both escaped in England.</i>

238
00:22:00,885 --> 00:22:05,245
<i>And what a bunch of ice-veined monsters
my family are.</i>

239
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:07,405
<i>How cold and thin-lipped,</i>

240
00:22:08,685 --> 00:22:10,925
<i>how dumpy and plain.</i>

241
00:22:11,005 --> 00:22:13,405
<i>How joyless and loveless.</i>

242
00:22:14,845 --> 00:22:19,325
<i>The way Cookie treated me looking
down at me through her dumpy nose,</i>

243
00:22:19,405 --> 00:22:23,805
<i>it was as much as I could do
not to let her have it with both barrels.</i>

244
00:22:23,885 --> 00:22:25,805
<i>And Shirley Temple,
who has the rank now</i>

245
00:22:25,885 --> 00:22:29,645
<i>to silence her common mother,
sadly, has no mind of her own.</i>

246
00:22:31,925 --> 00:22:36,085
<i>But I remained civil
because I am following your advice...</i>

247
00:22:37,965 --> 00:22:41,925
<i>to keep them on side,
keep a foot in the door...</i>

248
00:22:42,965 --> 00:22:46,125
<i>and see what we can get out
of the wretched circus.</i>

249
00:22:48,405 --> 00:22:53,565
<i>Perhaps even a raise on the allowance,
who knows?</i>

250
00:22:53,645 --> 00:22:58,805
<i>It's the only revenge I can think of
for the insult of your non-invitation,</i>

251
00:22:59,885 --> 00:23:02,445
<i>to drain their coffers to our benefit.</i>

252
00:23:02,525 --> 00:23:06,645
[mechanical clunking]

253
00:23:10,685 --> 00:23:12,285
<i>Thinking always of you</i>

254
00:23:12,365 --> 00:23:16,965
<i>and counting the minutes
until I am back in your arms.</i>

255
00:23:17,045 --> 00:23:18,525
<i>Your loving David.</i>

256
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:23,405
...and therefore commit his body
to the ground.

257
00:23:24,405 --> 00:23:31,205
Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

258
00:23:32,325 --> 00:23:37,525
In sure and certain hope
of the resurrection to eternal life,

259
00:23:37,605 --> 00:23:40,805
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

260
00:23:51,885 --> 00:23:54,165
- [gunshots]
- [dogs barking]

261
00:24:14,605 --> 00:24:18,725
- What is that thing?
- Oh, I inherited it from my grandfather.

262
00:24:18,805 --> 00:24:22,525
Well, as you know, Kaiser Wilhelm
was not blessed with a normal physique.

263
00:24:22,605 --> 00:24:24,925
No, the withered arm.

264
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:28,565
Ah, but he loved to shoot,
so modifications had to be made.

265
00:24:28,645 --> 00:24:30,885
[laughs]

266
00:24:32,685 --> 00:24:36,165
They didn't modify a shotgun,
they modified a cannon.

267
00:24:36,245 --> 00:24:39,365
[gunshots continue]

268
00:24:41,245 --> 00:24:43,325
You are a cheat, Hannover.

269
00:24:50,445 --> 00:24:55,125
[Mountbatten] <i>I realize that,
beyond these walls, the country mourns,</i>

270
00:24:55,205 --> 00:25:00,445
struggles under a program
of austerity and rationing

271
00:25:00,525 --> 00:25:03,165
but, what to do?

272
00:25:03,245 --> 00:25:06,125
It might all appear indulgent

273
00:25:06,205 --> 00:25:10,885
but, in keeping the estate
and the local community going,

274
00:25:10,965 --> 00:25:14,725
we are all doing our share tonight
for the economy.

275
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:15,805
[chuckling]

276
00:25:15,885 --> 00:25:18,245
So, let us start with a toast.

277
00:25:23,685 --> 00:25:27,365
- To His late Majesty, the King.
- [all] The King.

278
00:25:28,725 --> 00:25:34,445
- And, the Queen that has succeeded him.
- [all] The Queen.

279
00:25:34,525 --> 00:25:36,885
And to our generous host.

280
00:25:36,965 --> 00:25:39,565
And the Royal house
that is now in his name.

281
00:25:39,645 --> 00:25:42,245
[all] To our host and the Royal house.

282
00:25:42,325 --> 00:25:47,245
- To the Royal house Mountbatten.
- [all] To the Royal house Mountbatten.

283
00:25:51,645 --> 00:25:53,285
[airplane overhead]

284
00:25:54,645 --> 00:25:57,485
[Philip] Right, come on, then.
You can do it.

285
00:25:57,565 --> 00:25:58,805
Kick it back.

286
00:26:01,205 --> 00:26:02,725
Kick it back, boy. Go on.

287
00:26:04,765 --> 00:26:08,845
- It's not going to bite you. Kick it.
- [Parker] Ah, it's a Burnley centre back.

288
00:26:08,925 --> 00:26:10,645
Tell me,
do you play football with your boy?

289
00:26:10,725 --> 00:26:14,365
- When I get to see him, yeah. Rugby.
- Rugby? Chance'd be a fine thing.

290
00:26:14,445 --> 00:26:16,765
This one doesn't seem to want
to do anything but dream.

291
00:26:16,845 --> 00:26:20,365
Ah. Your old man struggling a bit, is he?

292
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:22,125
Well, come on then.
Show him how it's done.

293
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:25,565
Right. Come on then, Charles.
Let's give you something to aim at.

294
00:26:27,765 --> 00:26:29,725
That thing's been buzzing around
all morning.

295
00:26:29,805 --> 00:26:31,445
[whispers] Right between his trousers.

296
00:26:32,885 --> 00:26:35,885
Yup. Taking aerial photographs
for some magazine.

297
00:26:35,965 --> 00:26:38,005
- Oh, is that right?
- Mm-hm.

298
00:26:39,365 --> 00:26:42,005
It was always my dream
to join the Air Force.

299
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:45,925
But Dickie put me in the Navy.

300
00:26:46,005 --> 00:26:48,085
He felt the social connections
would be better.

301
00:26:49,205 --> 00:26:52,565
Hm. Judging by where you ended up,
I'd say the plan worked.

302
00:26:52,645 --> 00:26:56,645
- Ha.
- [whispers] Come on, Charles. Bash it.

303
00:26:56,725 --> 00:26:57,925
[gasps]

304
00:26:58,005 --> 00:27:01,405
Not bloody bad, Charles. Not bloody bad.

305
00:27:01,485 --> 00:27:04,165
- No, Daddy, not in the bushes!
- In the bushes he goes!

306
00:27:04,245 --> 00:27:06,045
[laughter]

307
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:09,205
No, Daddy! Not the bushes!

308
00:27:11,645 --> 00:27:14,445
Right, Charlie Boy, here we go.
I'm going to teach you...

309
00:27:25,325 --> 00:27:26,285
Come on, then!

310
00:27:52,725 --> 00:27:54,165
[bell dings]

311
00:27:57,525 --> 00:27:58,925
[Duke of Windsor] <i>Oh, it's vile.</i>

312
00:27:59,005 --> 00:28:01,485
Tommy Lascelles comes up to me
at the funeral, of all places,

313
00:28:01,565 --> 00:28:06,085
asks me for a word then tells me,
to my face, "Do you credit it?"

314
00:28:06,165 --> 00:28:10,005
I come all this way,
back to this gaping wound of a country,

315
00:28:10,085 --> 00:28:14,565
forbidden to bring my own wife,
to pay respects to my dear, late brother

316
00:28:14,645 --> 00:28:18,725
and they compound an already traumatic
and painful trip with this humiliation!

317
00:28:18,805 --> 00:28:21,805
The timing does seem
particularly unfortunate.

318
00:28:21,885 --> 00:28:23,285
It's an outrage!

319
00:28:24,445 --> 00:28:28,405
- How much is the allowance?
- Ten thousand a year.

320
00:28:28,485 --> 00:28:31,445
The agreement between Bertie and me
was that I would give up everything

321
00:28:31,525 --> 00:28:35,405
and go into exile and keep a low profile
in return for a pension

322
00:28:35,485 --> 00:28:39,365
that was clearly meant to be
for the term of my whole life, not his!

323
00:28:39,445 --> 00:28:42,525
Now he's barely cold
and Cookie turns off the bloody tap!

324
00:28:42,605 --> 00:28:45,645
- How dare she?
- You don't know that it was her.

325
00:28:45,725 --> 00:28:48,205
- Of course it was her.
- And don't call her that.

326
00:28:48,285 --> 00:28:50,965
Why not?
She's fat, common, and looks like a cook.

327
00:28:51,045 --> 00:28:53,405
Did they offer any justification?

328
00:28:53,485 --> 00:28:59,245
Oh, that it would appear insensitive
for a member of the extended Royal family

329
00:28:59,325 --> 00:29:02,365
to be seen to be rewarded
and live in luxury.

330
00:29:02,445 --> 00:29:03,965
Extended Royal family!

331
00:29:04,045 --> 00:29:07,285
I was the most senior member
of that family. The King!

332
00:29:07,365 --> 00:29:10,645
Now, we barely make ends meet!
Every day is a struggle.

333
00:29:10,725 --> 00:29:14,725
You live in great style
from what I've heard.

334
00:29:14,805 --> 00:29:18,365
Perhaps you should take a leaf
out of your late brother's book.

335
00:29:18,445 --> 00:29:23,165
- He was frugal, you know.
- He was born frugal. In every department.

336
00:29:23,245 --> 00:29:27,045
And that frugality
earned him great favour.

337
00:29:27,125 --> 00:29:29,605
And he passed it on
to the women in his family.

338
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:32,405
Who just spent 70,000
renovating Clarence House,

339
00:29:32,485 --> 00:29:35,725
so no lectures, please,
about the frugality of the new Queen.

340
00:29:35,805 --> 00:29:38,725
- That was her husband.
- What, the foundling?

341
00:29:38,805 --> 00:29:41,045
- Don't call him that.
- Why not?

342
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:44,645
I'd call him by his name, if he had one.

343
00:29:44,725 --> 00:29:46,445
[door opens]

344
00:29:49,205 --> 00:29:53,245
His Royal Highness, Prince Ernst August
of Hanover, Your Majesty.

345
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:55,125
- He's here.
- What?

346
00:29:55,205 --> 00:29:59,285
He apologizes for the lack of warning,
but said it was important.

347
00:29:59,925 --> 00:30:04,365
[sighs] All right.
You'd better show him in.

348
00:30:11,965 --> 00:30:12,925
Ah...

349
00:30:13,885 --> 00:30:16,805
[in German]
Dear Aunt, forgive the intrusion.

350
00:30:16,885 --> 00:30:18,725
I come directly from Broadlands.

351
00:30:18,805 --> 00:30:20,645
[in German]
What were you doing there?

352
00:30:20,725 --> 00:30:24,045
[in English] Please tell me you weren't
shooting, one day after the funeral.

353
00:30:24,125 --> 00:30:28,565
- Oh, <i>meine liebe</i> Ernst.
- I assure you the sport was very limited.

354
00:30:28,645 --> 00:30:32,285
And your late son was in our thoughts
the whole time.

355
00:30:32,365 --> 00:30:35,845
Anyway, in the evening,
we gathered for dinner.

356
00:30:35,925 --> 00:30:38,525
The food is normally quite good
at Broadlands.

357
00:30:38,605 --> 00:30:41,685
- Outstanding!
- Especially the duck, from memory.

358
00:30:41,765 --> 00:30:44,285
- With oranges.
- Rum-soaked raisins.

359
00:30:44,365 --> 00:30:46,605
Oh! A Prussian recipe.

360
00:30:46,685 --> 00:30:50,565
[in German] Spaetzle, too. Remarkable!
Crispy, with cheese and breadcrumbs.

361
00:30:50,645 --> 00:30:52,885
- Mmm. Delicious!
- [in English] Go on.

362
00:30:53,725 --> 00:30:59,165
Yes.
So, after dinner, our host started to brag

363
00:30:59,245 --> 00:31:02,285
about how the Royal house
would soon be in his name.

364
00:31:02,365 --> 00:31:03,805
Nonsense.

365
00:31:03,885 --> 00:31:07,805
The Royal Warrant of 1917
established the House of Windsor.

366
00:31:07,885 --> 00:31:10,925
- Ah.
- My late husband presided over it himself.

367
00:31:11,005 --> 00:31:15,005
But the name Windsor would only be carried
by the male descendants.

368
00:31:15,085 --> 00:31:18,485
It did not take into account
the female descendants.

369
00:31:18,565 --> 00:31:20,325
They would take the name
from their husbands

370
00:31:20,405 --> 00:31:22,605
- which, in this case, would mean...
- Mountbatten!

371
00:31:23,405 --> 00:31:24,925
Well...

372
00:31:25,765 --> 00:31:29,485
- He had us raising glasses to it.
- Glasses containing what?

373
00:31:31,325 --> 00:31:34,725
- Champagne.
- You were drinking champagne

374
00:31:36,165 --> 00:31:38,925
the day after my son's funeral?

375
00:31:56,365 --> 00:31:57,445
[Townsend] Come in.

376
00:32:03,325 --> 00:32:05,245
[sighs]

377
00:32:05,325 --> 00:32:06,605
I had to see you.

378
00:32:08,365 --> 00:32:09,405
Come in.

379
00:32:16,285 --> 00:32:19,405
I got home last night
to find this on the kitchen table.

380
00:32:38,645 --> 00:32:39,805
She's gone.

381
00:32:41,325 --> 00:32:42,925
All her belongings have gone.

382
00:32:45,245 --> 00:32:46,405
I'm so sorry.

383
00:32:48,005 --> 00:32:49,325
No, you're not.

384
00:32:50,125 --> 00:32:51,085
No.

385
00:32:53,005 --> 00:32:54,085
I'm not.

386
00:33:28,245 --> 00:33:32,645
- So, will you sue her for divorce?
- No, I'd lose my job.

387
00:33:32,725 --> 00:33:35,245
Well, you'll keep your job.
I'll make sure of that.

388
00:33:35,325 --> 00:33:37,725
It would make me a divorcee.

389
00:33:43,925 --> 00:33:45,325
But not the guilty party.

390
00:33:47,765 --> 00:33:52,445
Still, I'd be soiled goods.
I'd be tainted with scandal.

391
00:33:54,805 --> 00:33:56,445
[whispers] You'd also be free.

392
00:33:58,165 --> 00:33:59,325
To remarry.

393
00:34:05,445 --> 00:34:06,725
One day.

394
00:34:09,485 --> 00:34:10,525
Yes.

395
00:34:16,565 --> 00:34:18,845
[man] Down there, please.

396
00:34:18,925 --> 00:34:21,885
Christ. Hide. There, there. There. Go.

397
00:34:25,885 --> 00:34:28,165
[voices approaching]

398
00:34:29,885 --> 00:34:32,805
- Is it this one?
- Yeah, I think so.

399
00:34:32,885 --> 00:34:35,205
- No, no, it's not. It's this one.
- Right.

400
00:34:36,645 --> 00:34:37,565
Come in.

401
00:34:38,605 --> 00:34:40,365
Sorry to barge in.
Have you got a second?

402
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:41,485
- Of course, sir.
- May I?

403
00:34:41,565 --> 00:34:42,445
Please.

404
00:34:43,685 --> 00:34:45,645
That's what I want to talk to you about.

405
00:34:48,125 --> 00:34:50,485
- Flying.
- Yes, sir.

406
00:34:50,565 --> 00:34:52,725
You're an experienced air jockey
and I've an idea.

407
00:34:52,805 --> 00:34:55,485
And, look,
please disavow me of it if I'm wrong

408
00:34:55,565 --> 00:34:59,725
but, to be up there in a plane,
it's the biggest thrill of them all.

409
00:34:59,805 --> 00:35:03,805
- It is, sir.
- I mean, really. The biggest.

410
00:35:04,925 --> 00:35:06,005
It is, sir.

411
00:35:07,165 --> 00:35:13,165
Once you break through the clouds to
the clear blue beyond, the space, the...

412
00:35:14,965 --> 00:35:18,725
the silence, the transcendent beauty,

413
00:35:18,805 --> 00:35:22,805
it's church for the irreligious man.

414
00:35:22,885 --> 00:35:25,885
That's what I'd hoped you'd say.
Where could I learn?

415
00:35:25,965 --> 00:35:28,805
Uh... White Waltham Airfield,
they've a good school there.

416
00:35:28,885 --> 00:35:30,325
- Would you take me?
- Of course, sir.

417
00:35:30,405 --> 00:35:31,725
Good man.

418
00:35:34,525 --> 00:35:37,845
You know, my sister,
my favourite sister actually,

419
00:35:37,925 --> 00:35:40,085
Cecile, died in a plane.

420
00:35:40,165 --> 00:35:44,125
It went down over Ostend in a storm.

421
00:35:44,205 --> 00:35:45,885
Eight months pregnant.

422
00:35:46,765 --> 00:35:50,765
She went into labour mid-flight
and they found the child,

423
00:35:50,845 --> 00:35:52,805
next to her in the wreckage.

424
00:35:55,365 --> 00:35:56,685
A boy.

425
00:36:01,485 --> 00:36:02,885
Mm.

426
00:36:16,285 --> 00:36:17,885
Mm.

427
00:36:19,605 --> 00:36:21,965
New part of the uniform, Peter?

428
00:36:24,125 --> 00:36:25,485
[sighs]

429
00:36:28,965 --> 00:36:29,925
Anyone we know?

430
00:36:31,005 --> 00:36:33,285
[chuckles] I... no.

431
00:36:33,365 --> 00:36:34,725
[laughs]

432
00:36:34,805 --> 00:36:37,005
No, quite right. None of my business.

433
00:36:38,485 --> 00:36:39,445
Thank you, sir.

434
00:36:39,525 --> 00:36:43,605
[both laugh]

435
00:36:48,325 --> 00:36:50,085
[exhales]

436
00:36:51,445 --> 00:36:55,085
[laughs]

437
00:36:55,165 --> 00:36:56,805
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

438
00:36:59,125 --> 00:37:00,285
[laughs]

439
00:37:01,245 --> 00:37:02,085
Yes.

440
00:37:06,525 --> 00:37:08,525
Mr. Colville, Your Majesty.

441
00:37:11,045 --> 00:37:13,005
Your Majesties. Tommy.

442
00:37:14,285 --> 00:37:16,205
[Queen Mary] Come in, Jock. Take a seat.

443
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:20,805
We have a significant concern
which we'd like to convey

444
00:37:20,885 --> 00:37:22,725
to the Prime Minister.

445
00:37:22,805 --> 00:37:26,445
It concerns the Duke of Edinburgh.

446
00:37:37,445 --> 00:37:41,285
[Churchill] <i>Ma'am, word has reached me
that it is your desire</i>

447
00:37:41,365 --> 00:37:46,365
<i>that you and your children should keep
your husband's name, Mountbatten.</i>

448
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:48,845
It is.

449
00:37:48,925 --> 00:37:52,645
Ma'am, you must not.
It would be a grave mistake.

450
00:37:52,725 --> 00:37:55,765
Mountbatten was the adoptive name

451
00:37:55,845 --> 00:37:58,525
your husband took
when he became a British citizen.

452
00:37:58,605 --> 00:38:03,205
His real name...
you'll not need reminding,

453
00:38:03,965 --> 00:38:07,165
was
Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderberg-Glucksberg

454
00:38:07,245 --> 00:38:11,645
of the Royal houses of Denmark and Norway
and, latterly, of Greece!

455
00:38:17,325 --> 00:38:18,845
I am an old man.

456
00:38:20,485 --> 00:38:26,645
Many have questioned my relevance,
whether I still have something to offer.

457
00:38:26,725 --> 00:38:30,245
In public life, the answer is, I have.

458
00:38:30,325 --> 00:38:34,445
Which is to leave in place
a Sovereign prepared for office.

459
00:38:34,525 --> 00:38:37,885
Equipped, armed for her duty.

460
00:38:40,165 --> 00:38:46,285
Great things have happened to this country
under the sceptres of her queens

461
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:49,445
and you should be no exception.

462
00:38:49,525 --> 00:38:53,685
Yes, I am Queen, but I am also a woman.

463
00:38:55,805 --> 00:38:57,365
And a wife.

464
00:38:59,765 --> 00:39:04,045
To a man whose pride and whose strength
were, in part, what attracted me to him.

465
00:39:05,925 --> 00:39:09,365
I want to be in a successful marriage.

466
00:39:09,445 --> 00:39:13,365
I would argue, stability under this roof
might even be in the national interest.

467
00:39:13,445 --> 00:39:15,085
Had you considered that?

468
00:39:16,005 --> 00:39:17,645
[sighs]

469
00:39:17,725 --> 00:39:21,165
Very well. I will discuss it with Cabinet.

470
00:39:25,085 --> 00:39:26,005
No.

471
00:39:28,805 --> 00:39:32,925
You will inform the Cabinet,
Prime Minister.

472
00:39:36,285 --> 00:39:38,365
That is the favour you will do me,

473
00:39:40,325 --> 00:39:42,885
in return for one I'm already doing you.

474
00:39:48,885 --> 00:39:54,125
I know your party wants you to resign
to make way for a younger man.

475
00:39:54,205 --> 00:39:55,325
Mr. Eden.

476
00:39:57,525 --> 00:40:02,645
I also know that no one
will bring up your resignation

477
00:40:02,725 --> 00:40:05,565
while you are actively engaged
in planning the Coronation.

478
00:40:08,165 --> 00:40:13,245
So, by delaying my investiture,
you are, in fact, holding onto power...

479
00:40:17,245 --> 00:40:20,445
in which case, I would suggest
you are, somewhat, in my debt.

480
00:40:22,525 --> 00:40:25,605
So, if... I agree to the delay,

481
00:40:27,045 --> 00:40:32,125
perhaps you will consider supporting me
in the matter regarding my husband's name.

482
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:40,445
And perhaps you could also inform Cabinet

483
00:40:40,525 --> 00:40:44,565
that my husband and I
intend to stay here at Clarence House.

484
00:40:44,645 --> 00:40:47,245
- Why?
- It is our home.

485
00:40:48,965 --> 00:40:51,125
It has just been refurbished
at great expense.

486
00:40:52,365 --> 00:40:54,925
Buckingham Palace can still be
where official business is done

487
00:40:55,005 --> 00:41:01,765
but our home, our private family home,
will be Clarence House.

488
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:08,645
Very well.

489
00:41:30,125 --> 00:41:32,085
[Elizabeth]
<i>He was a little surprised, I think.</i>

490
00:41:32,165 --> 00:41:34,765
- [Philip] <i>Really?</i>
- <i>I dare express any view at all.</i>

491
00:41:34,845 --> 00:41:36,925
Papa was always putty in his hands.

492
00:41:37,005 --> 00:41:39,085
But I think one should start
as one means to continue.

493
00:41:39,165 --> 00:41:43,085
- Absolutely. Put a marker down.
- Quite. Draw a line in the sand.

494
00:41:43,165 --> 00:41:46,645
He said he'd put it to Cabinet
and I said there was nothing to discuss.

495
00:41:46,725 --> 00:41:49,325
- Good for you.
- No, good for you.

496
00:41:49,405 --> 00:41:51,685
- That's why I did it.
- Thank you.

497
00:41:55,005 --> 00:41:58,445
[crowd booing]

498
00:42:08,165 --> 00:42:11,725
[booing and shouting]

499
00:42:15,085 --> 00:42:17,165
Your Royal Highness, thank you for coming.

500
00:42:17,245 --> 00:42:20,685
Not at all, dear Winston. How can I help?

501
00:42:23,685 --> 00:42:27,365
I took it to Cabinet and, as expected,
the answer was unanimous,

502
00:42:27,445 --> 00:42:29,565
"No" to both matters.

503
00:42:29,645 --> 00:42:32,445
Well, she won't like it,
neither the snub over the name

504
00:42:32,525 --> 00:42:34,645
nor the move to Buckingham Palace.

505
00:42:34,725 --> 00:42:39,125
It really is a most dreadful place,
cold, uninviting,

506
00:42:39,205 --> 00:42:43,965
but it's the right thing, for the young
family and the children to live there.

507
00:42:44,045 --> 00:42:47,885
It's the focal point,
it's the monarch's home.

508
00:42:49,605 --> 00:42:54,565
- Do you want me to break it to her?
- That would be very kind.

509
00:42:54,645 --> 00:42:56,325
It's the least I can do.

510
00:42:56,405 --> 00:42:59,565
I've never forgotten the way
in which you defended me,

511
00:42:59,645 --> 00:43:03,925
fought for me during that terrible time.

512
00:43:04,005 --> 00:43:07,565
I still think no man
should be punished for love.

513
00:43:07,645 --> 00:43:10,725
And I also believe I spoke for many
in the country when I defended you.

514
00:43:11,605 --> 00:43:12,765
You're very kind.

515
00:43:15,165 --> 00:43:21,525
If I were to help you
in this matter with her,

516
00:43:21,605 --> 00:43:24,845
perhaps I could ask a favour in return?

517
00:43:26,685 --> 00:43:28,165
Name it.

518
00:43:40,645 --> 00:43:41,805
[door closes]

519
00:43:42,685 --> 00:43:48,005
Put in a word with the young Queen
for my allowance to be reinstated.

520
00:43:48,085 --> 00:43:50,485
She holds the purse strings now.

521
00:43:50,565 --> 00:43:54,245
The family expect me
to turn down commercial opportunities,

522
00:43:54,325 --> 00:43:57,485
yet cuts off my allowance
at the same time.

523
00:43:57,565 --> 00:43:59,725
Ten thousand pounds,

524
00:43:59,805 --> 00:44:03,285
it's quite impossible
to make ends meet without it.

525
00:44:03,365 --> 00:44:06,605
That a former King
should come to me begging...

526
00:44:09,125 --> 00:44:10,405
Consider it done.

527
00:44:13,365 --> 00:44:19,125
There is also a brief moment
before the Coronation

528
00:44:20,605 --> 00:44:24,565
where you might also
mobilize Cabinet support

529
00:44:24,645 --> 00:44:31,445
for the one other thing that has eluded me
and gnaws away at my heart.

530
00:44:31,525 --> 00:44:33,405
What?

531
00:44:33,485 --> 00:44:36,045
The appropriate title
for the woman I married.

532
00:44:36,125 --> 00:44:38,565
- No, sir.
- Her Royal Highness.

533
00:44:38,645 --> 00:44:41,565
She is, after all,
the wife of a former King.

534
00:44:41,645 --> 00:44:47,365
She's also a woman who has three husbands
that still live and breathe.

535
00:44:47,445 --> 00:44:50,845
It is her right, Winston.

536
00:44:50,925 --> 00:44:55,365
I'm determined she shall have it.
I'm determined she is shown respect.

537
00:44:57,205 --> 00:44:59,125
Will you fight for it?

538
00:44:59,205 --> 00:45:00,485
- [sighs]
- One more time?

539
00:45:00,565 --> 00:45:05,605
I have defended you so many times.
Each time to my cost and in vain.

540
00:45:06,805 --> 00:45:10,405
[sighs] This love for her
has destroyed everything.

541
00:45:11,405 --> 00:45:14,045
It is love, Winston.

542
00:45:15,285 --> 00:45:16,605
Love.

543
00:45:18,125 --> 00:45:20,805
The greatest thing on Earth.

544
00:45:27,925 --> 00:45:31,565
[orchestral music playing]

545
00:48:15,565 --> 00:48:16,485
[door opens]

546
00:48:16,565 --> 00:48:19,205
[man] His Royal Highness
the Duke of Windsor, Your Majesty.

547
00:48:24,285 --> 00:48:25,645
Your Majesty.

548
00:48:27,285 --> 00:48:29,445
Thank you for seeing me.

549
00:48:30,645 --> 00:48:32,005
Thank you for coming.

550
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:46,165
Well, most of the time we're in Paris.
We've been given a house there.

551
00:48:46,245 --> 00:48:50,565
Wallis likes to entertain.
She's so good at it.

552
00:48:50,645 --> 00:48:55,405
So the place is always full.
And we have dogs.

553
00:48:55,485 --> 00:48:57,405
Oh, really? What kind?

554
00:48:57,485 --> 00:49:04,445
Pugs. Davy Crockett, Trooper and Disraeli.

555
00:49:04,525 --> 00:49:09,205
- Why pugs? What's the attraction?
- Well, they're... childlike.

556
00:49:10,125 --> 00:49:13,645
- Need a lot of loving.
- They have a strange bark.

557
00:49:15,325 --> 00:49:17,405
- Yes.
- More of a yap.

558
00:49:17,485 --> 00:49:20,005
And they're lazy. Spend all day sleeping.

559
00:49:20,085 --> 00:49:22,685
- Yes.
- They're awfully gassy.

560
00:49:23,965 --> 00:49:24,925
Yes.

561
00:49:25,005 --> 00:49:27,765
I suppose one can always open the windows.

562
00:49:27,845 --> 00:49:29,085
[chuckles]

563
00:49:32,245 --> 00:49:34,485
- Don't you miss it?
- What?

564
00:49:34,565 --> 00:49:36,925
The country of your birth.
The people here.

565
00:49:38,085 --> 00:49:39,485
Your own flesh and blood.

566
00:49:40,445 --> 00:49:44,245
Well, I would've done
if they'd accepted the woman I love.

567
00:49:44,325 --> 00:49:48,325
But they didn't, so I don't.

568
00:49:48,405 --> 00:49:51,205
So the former King keeps himself
at a distance.

569
00:49:51,285 --> 00:49:55,805
A distance that was imposed upon me.
They wanted me out.

570
00:49:55,885 --> 00:49:58,365
And reduces us all to cruel nicknames.

571
00:50:00,405 --> 00:50:01,685
Shirley Temple.

572
00:50:03,525 --> 00:50:06,045
Uh... Yes.

573
00:50:07,365 --> 00:50:08,805
On account of the curls?

574
00:50:11,205 --> 00:50:13,685
And precociousness.

575
00:50:13,765 --> 00:50:16,685
- And stardom.
- You flatterer.

576
00:50:16,765 --> 00:50:17,805
Not at all.

577
00:50:18,845 --> 00:50:22,325
Generally,
we're better at queens than kings.

578
00:50:22,405 --> 00:50:25,525
In this country I have a feeling
you'll be no exception.

579
00:50:26,525 --> 00:50:29,965
- I certainly intend to do it well.
- I did, too.

580
00:50:31,125 --> 00:50:32,525
Obviously, not hard enough.

581
00:50:34,925 --> 00:50:35,845
No.

582
00:50:39,045 --> 00:50:41,245
You never apologized.

583
00:50:41,325 --> 00:50:43,685
To your papa, I most certainly did.

584
00:50:43,765 --> 00:50:46,645
Your mother too.
I can show you the letters.

585
00:50:46,725 --> 00:50:50,605
I didn't mean to them. I meant to me.

586
00:50:52,525 --> 00:50:53,405
You?

587
00:50:57,005 --> 00:50:58,885
You don't think I'm deserving of one.

588
00:51:01,285 --> 00:51:04,885
You don't think I would have preferred
to grow up out of the spotlight?

589
00:51:05,525 --> 00:51:06,845
Away from Court?

590
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:11,525
Away from the scrutiny and the visibility.

591
00:51:13,605 --> 00:51:14,765
A simpler life.

592
00:51:15,925 --> 00:51:17,085
Happier life.

593
00:51:18,205 --> 00:51:19,725
As a wife, a mother.

594
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:24,845
An ordinary English countrywoman.

595
00:51:27,685 --> 00:51:29,045
I'm sorry.

596
00:51:33,845 --> 00:51:35,285
Thank you.

597
00:51:42,285 --> 00:51:45,805
You might extend the same apology
to my husband the next time you see him.

598
00:51:45,885 --> 00:51:49,485
- Oh, is he struggling?
- A little.

599
00:51:49,565 --> 00:51:52,085
Well, it'd be odd if he weren't.

600
00:51:53,765 --> 00:51:57,405
Anyway, if I am to succeed,

601
00:51:58,325 --> 00:52:01,445
then he and I are going to need
all the help we can get.

602
00:52:01,525 --> 00:52:05,845
Well, I'm sure you're surrounded
by good people offering it.

603
00:52:05,925 --> 00:52:08,565
Not if they're always off
in Paris or New York,

604
00:52:08,645 --> 00:52:10,765
or wherever it is you spend your time.

605
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:14,805
Y-You would take my advice?

606
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:16,885
I would.

607
00:52:19,245 --> 00:52:21,325
Particularly now my father
isn't here to give his.

608
00:52:23,885 --> 00:52:26,525
I'd know it came from the heart.

609
00:52:26,605 --> 00:52:30,485
Since I know, deep down,
despite everything,

610
00:52:30,565 --> 00:52:32,405
that you care very deeply.

611
00:52:33,645 --> 00:52:35,325
I do.

612
00:52:43,365 --> 00:52:47,485
As it happens, there are two issues

613
00:52:47,565 --> 00:52:51,205
on which I would like to offer
some advice.

614
00:52:51,285 --> 00:52:56,365
The first is your husband's surname
and the name of the Royal house.

615
00:52:59,645 --> 00:53:00,965
And the second?

616
00:53:21,565 --> 00:53:24,525
There you are. There's something
I'd like to discuss with you.

617
00:53:24,605 --> 00:53:26,285
Now, please don't react.

618
00:53:27,525 --> 00:53:29,445
I'd like to take flying lessons.

619
00:53:31,045 --> 00:53:32,405
I know.

620
00:53:32,485 --> 00:53:35,805
But, trust me, becoming a pilot
has been a lifelong ambition of mine

621
00:53:35,885 --> 00:53:40,685
and I think I've found a teacher
mad enough to take me on as a pupil.

622
00:53:41,525 --> 00:53:43,285
Peter, no less, Peter Townsend.

623
00:53:48,085 --> 00:53:50,605
- What's the matter?
- I need to talk to you.

624
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:51,685
About what?

625
00:53:55,165 --> 00:53:57,005
They'd rather we didn't keep the name.

626
00:53:58,245 --> 00:53:59,805
Mountbatten.

627
00:54:01,045 --> 00:54:02,925
Who's "they?"

628
00:54:03,005 --> 00:54:05,325
- Cabinet.
- It's none of their business.

629
00:54:05,405 --> 00:54:08,085
[scoffs] I think you'll find
it's very much their business.

630
00:54:08,165 --> 00:54:10,845
You're my wife,
taking my name is the law.

631
00:54:10,925 --> 00:54:12,885
It's the custom. Not the law.

632
00:54:12,965 --> 00:54:15,765
A custom practiced so universally
it might as well be the law.

633
00:54:15,845 --> 00:54:18,045
You can't do this.
Am I to be the only man in the country

634
00:54:18,125 --> 00:54:19,925
whose wife and children
don't take his name?

635
00:54:20,005 --> 00:54:22,605
You can't do this to Dickie.
It will devastate him.

636
00:54:22,685 --> 00:54:25,525
You know that.
You know how important it is to him.

637
00:54:25,605 --> 00:54:28,725
I've told him the Royal house Mountbatten
is in the bag.

638
00:54:28,805 --> 00:54:32,245
Well, that was a mistake. It's not.

639
00:54:32,325 --> 00:54:36,165
The name has to be Windsor. For stability.

640
00:54:37,365 --> 00:54:38,325
There's more.

641
00:54:40,845 --> 00:54:43,965
- Clarence House...
- Our home. What about it?

642
00:54:45,805 --> 00:54:47,325
We have to give it up.

643
00:54:48,725 --> 00:54:50,605
The home of the Sovereign
of the United Kingdom

644
00:54:50,685 --> 00:54:51,765
is Buckingham Palace.

645
00:54:51,845 --> 00:54:52,965
Says who?

646
00:54:55,005 --> 00:54:56,645
Me.

647
00:54:58,805 --> 00:55:00,525
I thought you hated that place.

648
00:55:01,605 --> 00:55:03,925
I do. We all do.

649
00:55:06,205 --> 00:55:07,805
Then why go along with it?

650
00:55:09,165 --> 00:55:11,445
Because that's the overwhelming advice.

651
00:55:11,525 --> 00:55:13,565
But that's the point, Elizabeth,
it's just advice.

652
00:55:13,645 --> 00:55:15,685
It doesn't mean
that you have to act on it.

653
00:55:15,765 --> 00:55:18,365
When it comes from the government,
you do.

654
00:55:31,045 --> 00:55:32,885
What kind of marriage is this?

655
00:55:34,005 --> 00:55:35,925
What kind of family?

656
00:55:37,525 --> 00:55:39,765
You've taken my career from me,
you've taken my home.

657
00:55:39,845 --> 00:55:42,765
You've taken my name.

658
00:55:49,645 --> 00:55:51,725
I thought we were in this together.

659
00:56:03,445 --> 00:56:05,405
[door opens, closes]

660
00:56:26,325 --> 00:56:28,285
[Charles] See? Daddy's here.

661
00:56:29,045 --> 00:56:30,045
Welcome home, ma'am.

662
00:56:39,045 --> 00:56:43,085
[cheering]

663
00:56:56,725 --> 00:56:58,525
[Queen Elizabeth] <i>My Lords...</i>

664
00:56:59,845 --> 00:57:03,445
I hereby declare my will and pleasure

665
00:57:03,525 --> 00:57:08,685
that I and my children
shall be styled and known

666
00:57:08,765 --> 00:57:11,885
as the House and Family of Windsor.

667
00:57:13,925 --> 00:57:15,285
And that my descendants,

668
00:57:15,365 --> 00:57:20,165
other than female descendants
who marry, and their descendants,

669
00:57:20,245 --> 00:57:23,645
shall bear the name of Windsor.

670
00:57:33,205 --> 00:57:35,965
[cheering, applause]
