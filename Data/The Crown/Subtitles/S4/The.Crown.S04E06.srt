1
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,880
Thanks, mate.

2
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,920
<i>Stand by.
Rehearsal, nice and quiet, please.</i>

3
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,600
Are we still waiting on anyone?

4
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,640
<i>Bob Hawke,
if you win the election next week,</i>

5
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,960
<i>which all the polls predict,</i>

6
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,960
<i>one of your first public acts
as prime minister</i>

7
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,720
<i>will be to welcome Prince Charles</i>

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,520
<i>and the Princess of Wales
and young Prince William.</i>

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,600
Does that prospect
fill you with enthusiasm?

10
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,840
I don't, uh, regard it
as the most important thing

11
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,960
I'll have to do
in the first month in office.

12
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,320
But, yes, they are coming.

13
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,720
I've had the opportunity
of meeting Charles

14
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,360
on a number of occasions. I find him…

15
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,800
a nice young bloke.

16
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,520
Is he the sort of man
you'd like to be the king of Australia?

17
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,240
Look, I don't think we'll be
talking about, uh, kings or monarchy

18
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,440
here in Australia much longer.
We're past that now, aren't we?

19
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,800
We're a bit more mature.

20
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,880
Hear, hear.

21
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,440
You know my position on this.

22
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,520
It's no secret.

23
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,480
I respect and admire the Queen enormously.

24
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,560
The desire is simply
to have a head of state

25
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,680
that embodies and represents
Australia's values and traditions,

26
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,400
a head of state that looks like us,

27
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,920
sounds like us, thinks like us.

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,320
As opposed to?

29
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,040
Well, one of them. A pom.

30
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,840
You know, an unelected non-Australian
who lives on the other side of the world

31
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,800
and, for all their good intentions,
is a different breed.

32
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,400
You wouldn't put a pig in charge
of a herd of prime beef cattle…

33
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,520
…even if it looked good
in a twinset and pearls.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,280
Your Majesty.

35
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,680
The results
of the Australian general election.

36
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,080
Oh, good news or bad?

37
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,800
Mr. Hawke by a landslide.

38
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,000
- Oh dear. The one who wants us out?
- Afraid so.

39
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,560
The rough, tough
former trade union negotiator

40
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,280
and the proud holder
of the world record for beer drinking.

41
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,920
A yard of ale in a sconce pot
in 11 seconds.

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,080
I don't know what that is.
It sounds very impressive.

43
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,040
- Well, it's a lot of beer, very quickly.
- Ah.

44
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,560
Teetotal now, I believe, ma'am.

45
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,680
Oh, a great relief to everyone,
I should imagine.

46
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,080
Especially Mrs. Hawke.
Is there a Mrs. Hawke?

47
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,720
Yes, there is. Hazel.

48
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,720
Ah, Hazel. Strange, I think,
to name a child after a tree.

49
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,040
- Especially a northern hemisphere tree.
- Yes.

50
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,600
I suppose
it does put the pressure on them, rather.

51
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,000
On who, ma'am?

52
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,080
The Prince and Princess of Wales
and their forthcoming tour.

53
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,360
Do you think they'll be all right?
One shouldn't listen to gossip,

54
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,120
but I had lunch
with Princess Margaret the other day.

55
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,280
There's growing concern among those
who chatter at Kensington Palace…

56
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,240
- I thought we didn't listen to chatter.
- I listen to nothing else.

57
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,400
…about the Princess of Wales.

58
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,640
<i>She's struggling to cope, apparently.</i>

59
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,400
<i>Wretched in the marriage.</i>

60
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,040
<i>And…</i>

61
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,320
if rumors are to be believed,

62
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,160
she's, uh… doing things to herself.

63
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,920
What things?

64
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,760
People do the strangest things
when they're unhappy.

65
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,320
I heard she was insisting
on taking the baby with them on the tour.

66
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,520
- What for?
- As a stabilizing influence.

67
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,640
Since when has a baby ever been
a stabilizing influence on anything?

68
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,560
We never took the children anywhere.

69
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,240
When we went to Australia in 1954,
we left them at home for five months.

70
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,160
Hmm.

71
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,280
And do you suppose
that might have had consequences?

72
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,360
On what? The tour was a triumph.

73
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,040
I should probably ask Charles and Diana
to come and see me.

74
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,680
This tour is too important.

75
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,760
<i>Does anyone know
the story of the Russian bear hunter?</i>

76
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,401
<i>I'm afraid
I've already told Mrs. Parker Bowles.</i>

77
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,800
<i>- Perhaps she could help me tell it.
- All right, sir.</i>

78
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,616
<i>A bear hunter
goes deep into the Siberian woods.</i>

79
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,360
Suddenly, he sees…

80
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,120
…an enormous bear.

81
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,920
<i>The hunter raises his gun,</i>

82
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,080
and, bang, he shoots.
The bear disappears from view.

83
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,320
"Got him!" he thinks.

84
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,440
But then he feels a tap on the shoulder.

85
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,760
He looks up to see the bear, who says…

86
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,120
"No one takes a shot at me
and gets away with it!"

87
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,080
<i>"You have a choice."</i>

88
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,800
"Either I can tear you to pieces
and devour you now, or…"

89
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,720
"…or you can drop your trousers,
bend over,

90
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,120
and let me have my way with you."

91
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,680
The hunter pulls down his trousers,
and the bear does his worst.

92
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,440
Afterwards,
the hunter hobbles into town…

93
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,200
- …somewhat bow-legged.
- Yes!

94
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,080
And he buys a much bigger gun
and goes back into the woods.

95
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,680
And it isn't long
before he sees the bear again.

96
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,600
He raises his gun, bang, fires.

97
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,240
- But when the smoke clears…
- …the bear's nowhere to be seen.

98
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,000
"Got him," the hunter thinks.

99
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,040
But a moment later,

100
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,880
he feels another tap on his shoulder,
and the bear says…

101
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,200
"You know what to do."

102
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,880
Now, after the bear's done his worst,

103
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,960
the hunter heads back in town again
and buys an even bigger gun.

104
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,120
- A bazooka.
- Yes!

105
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,280
He goes back into the woods,
he sees the bear,

106
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,600
he takes aim and fires.

107
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,680
Boom!

108
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,680
But when the smoke clears…

109
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,120
the hunter looks up
to see the bear standing over him,

110
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,400
and the bear says…

111
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,360
"You're not in this for the hunting,
are you?"

112
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,320
I wanted to wish you both luck

113
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,320
and asked Sir Sonny to join us today

114
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,640
to stress again
the importance of the trip.

115
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,000
Thank you, ma'am.

116
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,200
As you know,
Australia is one of the most important

117
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,280
and influential members
of the Commonwealth.

118
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,840
If they were to strike out
and assert their independence,

119
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,600
the worry is
other countries could fall like dominoes.

120
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,840
You're too young to remember,
but we also toured Australia

121
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,440
and New Zealand in 1954.

122
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,520
Yes.

123
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,720
- It was long and hot and arduous.
- Yes.

124
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,040
- But we worked together.
- As a team.

125
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,440
And in the end, I think…

126
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,400
it wasn't only a success politically.

127
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,160
It…

128
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,440
brought us very close.

129
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,560
Yes.

130
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,080
And as husband and wife,

131
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,440
we would wish the same for you.

132
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,400
Mmm.

133
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,480
Aw, there.

134
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,480
It's all right. Mummy's here.
He's teething. Have you got the drops?

135
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,160
- He'll be all right on the plane.
- Diana.

136
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,280
Just glance over your shoulder.

137
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,040
Then on
to Ayers Rock on the 23rd.

138
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,600
Uh, Sydney on the 28th,

139
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,120
before Brisbane, Tasmania and Canberra

140
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,680
for an audience
with the prime minister and his wife.

141
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,360
Then the tour moves to New Zealand.

142
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,040
It's an awful lot of moving around.
A baby needs stability.

143
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,800
And… perhaps for that reason,

144
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,360
the baby was never intended
to be part of the trip.

145
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,560
I always made it perfectly clear.
No baby, no me.

146
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,280
And everyone accepted that
and has worked very hard

147
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,480
to change plans that were set in stone.

148
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,000
And now,
instead of being separated for six weeks,

149
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,160
it's just… How long?

150
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,160
- The first two weeks.
- What?

151
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,440
- When the tour is at its most arduous.
- Where will William be then?

152
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,480
Woomargama.

153
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,840
- Where?
- It's a sheep station in New South Wales.

154
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,880
Whose idea was this?

155
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,960
- Mine, ma'am.
- Do you have children?

156
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,360
- No, ma'am.
- Why does that not come as a surprise?

157
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,800
- Diana.
- Come with me.

158
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,280
- Ma'am.
- Please.

159
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,880
What do you see?

160
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,440
His Royal Highness
Prince William.

161
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,080
That's a title. You can't see a title.

162
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,320
Very well. I see… a baby boy.

163
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,600
Asleep or awake?

164
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,880
- Awake.
- Loud or quiet?

165
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,040
- Quiet.
- Angry or calm?

166
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,880
- Calm.
- Ugly or beautiful?

167
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,040
It's just a question,
nothing to be frightened of.

168
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,960
- Is the child ugly?
- No.

169
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,760
Then can we agree
that this child is the opposite of ugly?

170
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,600
Can we say he's a beautiful child?

171
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,400
I'm busy, ma'am. What is your point?

172
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,160
My point is that
this child is not just beautiful.

173
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,840
This child is perfect in every single way.

174
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,400
So why should you expect me,
as his mother,

175
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,240
to be without him for one second,
let alone two weeks?

176
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,240
Because you married
the Prince of Wales, ma'am.

177
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,040
And that is an act of service
to the Crown and to the country,

178
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,520
which you signed up to willingly
and with open eyes,

179
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,640
and you are the Princess of Wales.

180
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,760
Then the greatest act of service
that I can give to the Crown as princess

181
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,920
is not to be some meek little wife
following the great prince around

182
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,480
like some smiling doll,

183
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,880
but to be a living,
breathing, present mother,

184
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,400
bringing up this child in the hopes
that the boy that will one day become king

185
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,000
still has a vestige of humanity in him.

186
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,400
God knows he's not going to be getting it
from any of his courtiers.

187
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,880
Mummy's here.

188
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,720
Uh…

189
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,240
- New Zealand.
- Yes, New Zealand.

190
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,200
Welcome to Alice Springs.
More than a month's rain in a week.

191
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,800
Hello there. Charles, lovely name.

192
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,200
Very good. Nice to meet you.

193
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,240
Hello there. Lovely to meet you.

194
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,800
- He's not very happy.
- I will mind him.

195
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,760
- Diana.
- Are you all right with him?

196
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,200
Diana! Come on.

197
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,760
We have to go.

198
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,480
I understand before we arrived,

199
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,280
you received
about a month's worth of rain in a week.

200
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,080
Of course, in Britain,
we call that summer.

201
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,240
But seriously, my wife and I,
we couldn't be more delighted to be here.

202
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,320
Question for the princess.

203
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,520
What part of the tour
are you most looking forward to?

204
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,320
Oh gosh. Um…

205
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,600
There's so many.

206
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,000
We're going
to a glamorous ball in Sydney.

207
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,760
And, um…

208
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,960
The Royal Botanical Gardens…

209
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,200
<i>We're going to visit
the Royal Botanical Gardens in Sydney.</i>

210
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,160
Oh God!

211
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,520
<i>And I think we're going
on a pleasure cruise on… some river.</i>

212
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,720
<i>Um…</i>

213
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,400
And then we're going to visit Ayers Dock.

214
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,360
- Rock. Rock!
- Ayers Rock.

215
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,040
- She really say that?
- Blimey!

216
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,160
Honestly.

217
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,840
What about the cost of the trip

218
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,200
at a time when Australia is
experiencing extreme weather, you know,

219
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,320
<i>and the money could be spent
on the victims?</i>

220
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,440
<i>I'm afraid
that's not really my department.</i>

221
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,520
<i>She's good with glamorous balls.</i>

222
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,240
<i>Ayers Rock, or "Ayers Dock" …</i>

223
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,720
Apparently, there are protests planned
for their visit to Canberra.

224
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,160
A growing backlash
about the expense of the trip.

225
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,480
Maybe now's the moment.

226
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,160
1788, the First Fleet landed
at Sydney Cove.

227
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:17,520
Two long centuries of subjugation
by Mother Crown,

228
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,120
and we are still unable
to cut the apron strings

229
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,080
and stand on our own two feet.

230
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,160
Why?

231
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,840
Because there has never been
the tipping point

232
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,360
where we finally say, "Enough."

233
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,440
But, uh…

234
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,800
five'll get you ten
it'll be this jug-eared bonehead

235
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,880
that pushes us all over the edge.

236
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,200
And Australia gets to be free…

237
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,520
once and for all.

238
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,240
<i>That's all for now.</i>

239
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,720
<i>- Thank you all very much.
- Thank you.</i>

240
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,240
<i>Thank you.</i>

241
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:07,280
<i>An hospitable Perth,
fresh, alert, scrubbed by the sun.</i>

242
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,000
<i>City of Australia's tomorrow.</i>

243
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,080
<i>Into Queensland,</i>

244
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,680
<i>named for another great queen
four generations back.</i>

245
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,360
<i>To Brisbane, friendly, easygoing Brisbane.</i>

246
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,680
What's this?

247
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,960
Australia, 1954.

248
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,720
I wanted to remind myself.

249
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,800
Huh.

250
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,800
One of your greatest hits.

251
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,320
Yes, I think so.

252
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,440
How hot it was!
Do you remember?

253
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,720
Yes, one could hardly sleep at night.

254
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,640
No.

255
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,320
Look at the size of those crowds.

256
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,240
<i>Head of the Commonwealth,
defender of the faith.</i>

257
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,656
Sydney,
over a million people turned out.

258
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,880
- To see the beautiful new Queen.
- Mmm.

259
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,040
Now she's old and dumpy,
they want rid of her.

260
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,920
Not old and dumpy. Experienced and mature.

261
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,400
Which is why you should have gone yourself
instead of sending out the B-team.

262
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,520
This was always designed
to be Charles's tour.

263
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
As Prince of Wales,
he has to start sometime.

264
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,400
Then send him
to the Bahamas or Seychelles,

265
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,480
not Australia and New Zealand.

266
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,200
Some countries are too important
to send out the understudy.

267
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,640
<i>…a living symbol
of the unity of Crown and people.</i>

268
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,440
<i>And a nation waits.</i>

269
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,320
- Your Royal Highness, over here.
- Towards the cameras, please.

270
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,640
Maybe just get in closer together
if possible.

271
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,040
- Princess Diana, over this way.
- That's great. Thank you.

272
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,760
- Can we get some big smiles, please?
- Can we get waves for the Australians?

273
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,360
- Lady Di!
- Diana!

274
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,240
Are you going up to the top today?

275
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,880
Charles.

276
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,400
Charles!

277
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,080
I can't.

278
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,640
The heat.

279
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,160
I feel dizzy.

280
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,640
You all right?

281
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,720
- I think I need to go and sit down.
- Can you pull yourself together?

282
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,920
Do you need some water?
Are you feeling all right, Diana?

283
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,120
- Is it the heat?
- Are you all right, Princess?

284
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,640
<i>It was at this point
the princess seemed to struggle.</i>

285
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,240
<i>The English rose wilting in the heat,
perhaps.</i>

286
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,520
It's pathetic.

287
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,480
She's pathetic.

288
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:57,520
It's so critical
we get this tour absolutely right,

289
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,080
and yet she's so weak and fragile.

290
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,520
One can't rely on her
for the simplest thing.

291
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,640
Letting the side down wherever she goes.

292
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,240
<i>How will I get through the next six weeks
without you?</i>

293
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,240
By ringing me every day.

294
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,840
Letting me cheer you up.

295
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,600
You're going to be brilliant.

296
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,240
God, I miss you, my darling,

297
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,840
your adulthood.

298
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,800
If Diana had one ounce
of the strength of character

299
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,760
that you seem to display at every turn,
perhaps we'd rescue...

300
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,776
- Change the plan!
- Ma'am...

301
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,800
- God, now what?
- I won't go on like this.

302
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,120
- You understand? I mean it!
- It never ends.

303
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,240
I'll call you back.

304
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,360
We'd have to reorganize police,
schools, couriers, military...

305
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,680
Well, I don't care about any of that!

306
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,720
It's intolerable.

307
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,800
What's intolerable?

308
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,920
Well, I don't expect <i>you </i>to understand.

309
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,360
I just need him to let me go
wherever it is they've taken my son.

310
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,680
Woomargama?
It's on the other side of the country.

311
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,400
I explained to Her Royal Highness
we are five days into an important tour

312
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,280
which has been years in the planning.
We can't change things around willy-nilly.

313
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,840
- And I told him...
- He has a name.

314
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,720
If people expect me to continue
with this tour for another minute,

315
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,120
then I need to see my son first.

316
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,760
<i>Our </i>son.

317
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,640
- Hello.
- Your Royal Highness.

318
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,360
William?

319
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,440
William.

320
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,840
William!

321
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,400
Thank you so much. Has he been all right?

322
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,720
- He's been great.
- Hi, darling!

323
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,080
Hello! How are you?

324
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,160
Yes.

325
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,800
Oh, I missed you so much.

326
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,120
Yes. Hello!

327
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,840
You want to go to Daddy?

328
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,720
- Prince William, over here.
- Do we have a crown somewhere?

329
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,400
Who does he look like more?
What are his favorite toys?

330
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,440
Is he more Spencer or Windsor?

331
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,880
- William!
- Come on.

332
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,680
Not bad for a future king.

333
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,160
Oh, that's lovely. King and heir.

334
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,920
- Little performer.
- What about a spare?

335
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,240
Come to Daddy.

336
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,360
He's doing quite well.

337
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,080
There you are. Close your eyes.

338
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,800
Gone down?

339
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,840
Yes, finally.

340
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,960
Exhausted after his performance.

341
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
The star.

342
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,040
Crashing and bashing into everything.

343
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,120
The basher.

344
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,720
A mini tornado.

345
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,720
Will you eat? They made…

346
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,840
somewhat unimaginatively
for a sheep station, shepherd's pie.

347
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,360
I'm not hungry.

348
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,560
What?

349
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,960
I wanted to talk to you.
I've had some thoughts.

350
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,160
About?

351
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,840
Us.

352
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,080
Well, I have some things
I'd like to discuss too.

353
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,480
Would you like to go first?

354
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,920
- It'd make a nice change.
- What does that mean?

355
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,360
- It means you always go first.
- What poppycock.

356
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,080
You're the Prince of Wales.
You're born to go first.

357
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,760
Are you even remotely aware
of how bad things have got for me?

358
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,280
I'm not blind.

359
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,960
I can see how unhappy you are.

360
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,320
How thin you've become.

361
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,880
You don't know the half of it.

362
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,840
I know more than you think.

363
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,400
People talk. The staff. And I was…

364
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,800
very saddened…

365
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,120
horrified by what I learned.

366
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,240
So, what do you want from me?

367
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,600
To be heard.

368
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,400
And I'm listening.

369
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,960
No, more than that.

370
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,720
To be understood, appreciated.

371
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,720
I don't need endless flattery.
No one wants that.

372
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,840
But I am trying my hardest to please you,

373
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,760
to live up to your standards,

374
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,640
and I don't think
you have the faintest idea

375
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,400
of what it's like to feel this way.

376
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,240
- To be constantly overlooked, ignored...
- Don't have the faintest idea?

377
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,480
I know what being overlooked feels like.

378
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:41,080
I've spent my whole life being unthanked,

379
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,600
unappreciated, uncared for.

380
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:47,280
And if I've been cold or distant with you,

381
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,120
perhaps it's because I don't feel
truly understood by you.

382
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,640
I sometimes think
you see me as an old man.

383
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,320
Or worse,
a gargoyle above the church door.

384
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,000
Gray, made of stone,

385
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,200
unemotional, but I'm not.

386
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,920
You think I don't crave
the occasional "Well done," or…

387
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,440
"Aren't you clever?"
Or even just a thank-you.

388
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,720
I need encouragement
and the occasional pat on the back too.

389
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,360
Does that explain
why you keep going to her?

390
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,600
I'm not going to say her name.
I'm worried if I do, I might spit.

391
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,640
Camilla. What's she got to do with it?

392
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,920
That's what I keep asking myself.
What's she got to do with anything?

393
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,400
But, obviously,
she's got a lot to do with everything

394
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,920
because you can't leave her alone.

395
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,240
She and her husband are close friends,
not just of mine, but the whole family's.

396
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,160
Remember I found your bracelet,

397
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,040
the one with your nicknames
engraved on it, Fred and Gladys?

398
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,120
It was harmless fun.

399
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,960
Three days before our wedding,
you gave that to her.

400
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,040
And on our actual honeymoon,
you wore the cuff links that she gave you,

401
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,520
with the interlocking initials,
the two Cs,

402
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,480
interwoven
and obscenely entwined like lovers.

403
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,800
And on the same honeymoon, a photograph
of her falls out of your diary.

404
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,480
Later in the year,
I find your love letters.

405
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,680
Page after page
with a passion I'm not getting from you!

406
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,680
'Cause you show no interest in me!

407
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,280
You refuse to come to Highgrove,
where I'm happiest.

408
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,160
Yes, because <i>she</i> is there!

409
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:21,000
And not just her, but the gardens
and the polo and the hunts,

410
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,560
and the boring old philosophers
and father substitutes

411
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,240
who patronize me and ignore me,
but <i>love </i>her, presumably.

412
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,000
Which is why the two of you
are perfect for each other.

413
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,280
- So, where do I fit in?
- You fit in because you're my wife.

414
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,320
And…

415
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,760
because…

416
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,200
I love you.

417
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,680
I…

418
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,040
- I...
- I do.

419
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,360
Gosh.

420
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,960
So…

421
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,320
how are we going to solve it?

422
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,800
Well…

423
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Well, I suppose…

424
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,240
I suppose we've got to learn

425
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,240
to give it to each other
on a more regular basis.

426
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,480
The encouragement, I mean.

427
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,040
- Well, and the other thing.
- Well, yes, that too.

428
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,800
'Cause I still think you're gorgeous.

429
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,080
- Cleverest, handsomest man in every room.
- Do you really?

430
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,520
Pathetic,
but I do need that sometimes.

431
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,800
And you look gorgeous too.

432
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:49,800
Your beauty, your radiance is
a great shining, spectacular miracle.

433
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:54,520
When I see the light in people's faces
when they look at you, it makes me realize

434
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,240
that I'm the luckiest man in the world,
we're the luckiest family in the world.

435
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,040
It makes me want
to ring the Queen and say,

436
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,880
"Can you hear that? Listen to that!"

437
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,400
"It's 100 decibels louder
than anything you ever got."

438
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,320
"Chew on that! Choke on that!"

439
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,720
I think this might be the most important
conversation we've ever had.

440
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,600
- Yes.
- And the solution is so simple.

441
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,480
Any time either of us feels
we're not getting what we need,

442
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,480
we simply need to give that very thing
to the other.

443
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,320
- If you learned anything from today...
- We both need the same as each other.

444
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,320
To be encouraged.

445
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,840
To be supported.

446
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,800
And to be…

447
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,360
appreciated.

448
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,120
To be loved.

449
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,840
Yes.

450
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,200
A toast.

451
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,160
To a fresh start.

452
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,520
A new beginning.

453
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,920
Happy Easter, my darling.

454
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,480
Well done, brave boy.

455
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,320
What does he want?

456
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,680
Give him a kiss.

457
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,360
- What have I got here?
- What's that?

458
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,160
<i>The first leg
of the royal tour has come to an end.</i>

459
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,000
<i>The prince and princess have seen
a slice of the Northern Territory…</i>

460
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,720
<i>The royal couple emerged.
2,000 well-wishers there to greet them.</i>

461
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,160
<i>But the more formal welcome</i>

462
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,560
<i>came from the governor-general
and the prime minister.</i>

463
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,000
Welcome to sunny Perth.

464
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,640
We're absolutely delighted to be here.
Thank you so much.

465
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,920
<i>Hours before
they were to arrive in the city,</i>

466
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,320
<i>tens of thousands of people
began lining the streets from the airport.</i>

467
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,560
<i>By now,
the pace was really beginning to pick up,</i>

468
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,720
<i>and so too was the public's reaction.</i>

469
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,600
<i>More than 5,500 people
queued patiently</i>

470
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,880
<i>to take up the best possible position
around the ropes cordoning off…</i>

471
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,200
<i>Here, the reception
the royal couple were getting was growing…</i>

472
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,416
<i>There was a frenzy
of waving hands and flags</i>

473
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,960
<i>as the prince and princess appeared,</i>

474
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,280
<i>holding hands
in the back of their Rolls-Royce.</i>

475
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,680
<i>The crowds were desperate
to get a glimpse of the perfect couple.</i>

476
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,840
<i>The Prince and Princess of Wales…</i>

477
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,360
<i>Even overseas reporters,
who've seen it all before,</i>

478
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,840
<i>seemed a little taken aback</i>

479
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,480
<i>by the sheer scale
and excitement of the welcome…</i>

480
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,160
We've gotta get a good spot.

481
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,480
<i>Please welcome
the heir to the throne</i>

482
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,640
<i>and Australia's future king,</i>

483
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,000
His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales.

484
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,480
Thank you, Sir James.

485
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,240
In case you've been living in a cave,

486
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,120
perhaps I should introduce you
to a most remarkable woman and mother

487
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,160
who I am proud to call my wife.

488
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,440
Lady Di!

489
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,480
I love you, Diana!

490
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:26,520
Diana, I love you!
I love you so much! I love you!

Your Royal Highness.

A phone call
from Mrs. Parker Bowles.

516
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,240
Would you like to return it?

517
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,360
No.

518
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,080
No, I wouldn't.

519
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,760
Thank you, Edward. That will be all.

520
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,520
- You had fun together at the ball.
- We did.

521
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,600
I could've danced all night.

522
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,640
So, has that been the highlight?

523
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,840
Well, that's hard to say. Um…

524
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,480
We greatly enjoyed seeing Sydney Harbor,

525
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,120
and Charles tried bodysurfing
on Bondi Beach.

526
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:10,240
But, um, I suppose the greatest highlight
has been, well…

527
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:15,360
Well, meeting all of you,
the people of Australia.

528
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,360
You've made us feel so welcome,
so at home.

529
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,600
Well, perhaps
because you've been so refreshing.

530
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,800
You're not what we expect from royalty.

531
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,760
That's because
I don't think of myself as royalty.

532
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,320
No. First and foremost,
I'm a wife and a mother.

533
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,160
That's what's most important to me.

534
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,720
She really is a wonderful mother.

535
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,880
And how's William getting along?

536
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,440
He's having a magical time here.

537
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,720
So, he likes Australia?

538
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,400
Well, let's put it like this.

539
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,120
His favorite cuddly toy
used to be a whale.

540
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,440
But since coming here,
it's been firmly supplanted by a koala.

541
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,360
<i>More than 10,000 people were waiting</i>

542
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,680
<i>to catch sight of the prince and princess.</i>

543
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,560
<i>The princess was overwhelmed
with posies and small gifts from…</i>

544
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,160
Prime Minister's Office.

545
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,320
No, he's very busy at the moment
and cannot comment.

546
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,480
Mr. Hawke will not be answering
any questions about this at present.

547
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,240
- Hello!
- Look up, Diana!

548
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,640
- This way!
- Up here!

549
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,760
Diana!

550
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,096
- There she is!
- I love you!

551
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,000
Look over there.
She's just there.

552
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,560
Lady Di!

553
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:40,040
Why don't I take one of you?
That's more interesting.

554
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,600
There you go. Ready? Smile.

555
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,960
Cheese!

556
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,840
Okay!

557
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,280
Smile, ma'am, this way.

558
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,160
- Charles!
- Hello!

559
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,720
- She's gorgeous. You're lucky to have her.
- Thank you.

560
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,240
- What do you think of Brisbane?
- Glorious.

561
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:13,560
- Diana, come back to Brisbane again soon.
- Oh, like a boomerang. Just watch me.

562
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,920
Oh, please do.

563
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,200
- I love your dress.
- I like yours!

564
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,440
- Would you like to swap?
- Oh, I wish! You're so beautiful.

565
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,480
- Diana!
- Oh, look at your uniforms.

566
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,000
They're so sweet.

567
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,320
Diana!

568
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,120
Stay back, please.

569
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,600
<i>Finally,
the prince and princess arrived,</i>

570
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,000
<i>and pandemonium broke loose.</i>

571
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,040
There's a problem no one foresaw.

572
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,200
Huge crowds wherever they go.

573
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,280
Some even bigger, I'm told,

574
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,880
than you got, back in the 18th century,
or whenever you went.

575
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,560
1954.

576
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,720
And I very much doubt it.

577
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,800
Along with raves in all the newspapers
for Diana's beauty.

578
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,280
And charm.
And, most of all, her motherhood.

579
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,280
I heard she'd been hysterical,

580
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,160
clinging to the poor baby
like a life raft.

581
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,360
Evidently, that clinging is
what the Australians have responded to.

582
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,720
What a natural mother she is.

583
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,200
How physical.

584
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,280
And caring.

585
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,960
Why is all this a problem?

586
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,520
You and I both know
how much Charles craves reassurance,

587
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,760
and attention, and praise.

588
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,960
This tour of Australia and New Zealand
was supposed to be his grand debut,

589
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,760
his moment in the sun as future king.

590
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,680
Just saying.

591
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,640
<i>But there was little doubt
who most people really wanted to see.</i>

592
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,280
Hello. Thank you.

593
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,280
Hello. Thanks for coming.

594
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,320
Thank you. Hello, everyone.

595
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,000
Where's Princess Di?

596
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:31,120
She's busy working, I'm afraid.
You'll have to put up with me.

597
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,200
Aww…

598
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,720
Oh, we only really came
to see Lady Di.

599
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,360
<i>Will you go for a swim, ma'am?</i>

600
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,120
I don't think so.

601
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,560
Which one do you fancy
giving you the kiss of life?

602
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,360
Let's hope it doesn't come to that!

603
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,120
How about it, boys? Any volunteers?

604
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,240
- I think you've got some admirers.
- Can we get you guys in closer?

605
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,160
- No worries.
- Just remember, no touching, no looking.

606
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,400
Who? Me or them?

607
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,640
<i>Picked up nicely there
by His Royal Highness, and off it goes.</i>

608
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,920
<i>Number five is trying to cut him off.</i>

609
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:11,760
<i>Prince Charles here, the Prince of Wales,
playing on a borrowed pony called Apollo.</i>

610
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,720
We want Di!

611
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,600
<i>A strong hit from number two there.</i>

612
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,640
<i>And here comes Prince Charles,
swooping from his position at the back.</i>

613
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,920
Is everybody ready?

614
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,960
- We want Di!
- Get set. Go!

615
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,280
<i>Taking a shot…</i>

616
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,600
All right, Charles?

617
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,720
Are those for me?
That is so kind of you. Thank you.

618
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,520
- Are you a real princess?
- Why don't you poke me and find out?

619
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,120
Did that work?

620
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,400
<i>As they move
from Queensland to Tasmania,</i>

621
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,840
<i>the royal tour is
going from strength to strength.</i>

622
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,920
<i>And whilst it's been a great
personal victory for Prince Charles,</i>

623
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,440
<i>no one can deny
it's the Princess of Wales</i>

624
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,200
<i>who's truly captured
the heart of a nation.</i>

625
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,560
<i>Well, she's not stuffy
like the rest of the royals.</i>

626
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,200
<i>You get a sense
of her being a real person.</i>

627
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,360
<i>- Yes.
- You've gotta love her, haven't you?</i>

628
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,576
<i>Do you love Charles
as much as you love Diana?</i>

629
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,120
<i>Yeah. She loves him.
He must have something!</i>

630
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,240
<i>What do you think
of the princess?</i>

631
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,920
- <i>She's amazing.
- She's just like us.</i>

632
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,320
<i>Do you think
you could have a cup of tea with her?</i>

633
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,200
<i>Absolutely. She's really down to earth.
That's why I love her.</i>

634
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,760
- Lady Diana, over here!
- Your Royal Highness, this way, please!

635
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,200
Lovely to meet you.

636
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,240
- Hello. Lovely to meet you.
- Good evening, Mr. Premier.

637
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,640
Lovely to see you again. Mrs. Gray.

638
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,800
Thank you.

639
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,600
Diana, this way, please!

640
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,880
It's a great pleasure
to be able to come to Tasmania

641
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,600
to receive such an enthusiastic
and heartwarming welcome.

642
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,960
The last time I was here
was two years ago, in 1981,

643
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:15,200
shortly before we were married,
and at that time,

644
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,080
everybody was saying, "Good luck,"
and, "Hope everything goes well,"

645
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:23,200
and, "How lucky you are
to be engaged to such a lovely lady."

646
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:28,720
And, my goodness,
I am lucky enough to be married to her.

647
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,840
That's the thing about ladies.

648
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:40,680
You never quite know what they get up to
when your back's turned.

649
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,160
It's the final straw. Pulling faces,

650
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,160
horsing around
while I'm trying to do my job.

651
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,640
I was blushing!
Blushing at your compliments.

652
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,200
People were laughing at me,
laughing in my face,

653
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,320
at the end of a week in which
half of Australia's also been booing me!

654
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,120
I don't deserve this.

655
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,480
This is supposed to be <i>my </i>tour.

656
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,160
My tour as Prince of Wales

657
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,280
to shore up a key country
in the Commonwealth

658
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,080
at a very delicate moment politically.

659
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,200
- And thanks to you...
- People have shown up!

660
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,080
Thanks to me, people are interested!

661
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,920
No! Thanks to you,
people are laughing in my face!

662
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:17,280
Booing the heir to the throne,
booing the Crown.

663
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,880
Oh, come on! Oh, don't do this.

664
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,600
Please!

665
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,160
Open the door.

666
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Charles?

667
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,560
We still have ten days in New Zealand
to get through.

668
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,960
- Welcome, Your Royal Highness.
- Prime Minister.

669
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:56,400
Given our different perspectives,
our different views

670
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,720
on the… appropriate governance
of this nation,

671
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,960
I never thought I'd find myself
commiserating with you, but…

672
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:08,560
Let's face it.
She's made us both look like chumps.

673
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,720
I… don't understand.

674
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,080
Terra nullius.

675
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:22,000
That's what your ancestor
King George III called us

676
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,080
when the Brits first arrived.

677
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,120
"Nobody's country."

678
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,400
Well,

679
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,440
by God,
we were somebody's country then,

680
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,760
and… we're our own country now.

681
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,720
When you arrived, I thought…

682
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,040
your visit might inspire Australia
to finally…

683
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:48,280
throw off the shackles
and stand on her own two feet,

684
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:53,320
and… no offense,
but if it'd just been you, you know,

685
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,120
I might've got my wishes!

686
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,880
But then, you know…

687
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,400
she comes along.

688
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:08,000
The perfect wife, the perfect princess,

689
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:10,360
and the whole place goes nuts.

690
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,760
It's the power of fairy tales.

691
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:23,520
That superstar may have just set back
the cause of republicanism in Australia

692
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,200
for the foreseeable future.

693
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,520
- Lady Di!
- Love you!

694
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,480
Bye, Princess Diana!

695
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,040
Sir.

696
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:12,880
Highgrove.

697
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,320
Kensington Palace.

698
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,880
It's the Princess of Wales.

699
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,720
I was hoping the Queen might see me.

700
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,320
Welcome back.

701
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,400
Thank you, Mama.

702
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,600
- You said I should always call you that.
- Of course.

703
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,520
Please.

704
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,280
- Thank you, Nigel.
- Ma'am.

705
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,960
I've come because…

706
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,880
Well, I don't know who to turn to anymore.

707
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:54,800
I'm struggling.

708
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:56,560
Struggling?

709
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,800
My dear, you've just had a triumph.

710
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,480
I don't consider it a triumph

711
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:04,960
if at the end of it,
my husband and I are wretchedly unhappy.

712
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,200
Look at these pictures of you both
everywhere.

713
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,640
Are you really telling me
that's unhappiness?

714
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,760
Well, not in that moment, no.

715
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:16,720
In that moment, it's… perfect happiness.

716
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:20,280
But then behind closed doors,
it's a different story.

717
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:22,960
He resents me,
resents the attention I get.

718
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:25,720
And why is that?

719
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:27,680
I don't know.

720
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:32,080
I was hoping you could tell me.
He's your son.

721
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,720
Because I've been a terrible mother?
Is that what you've come here to tell me?

722
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,760
- No.
- The Duke of Edinburgh a terrible father?

723
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:40,600
- Of course not.
- I struggle to understand Charles too.

724
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:41,920
I think that's no secret.

725
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,360
But us sitting here
sticking knives into him

726
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:45,680
isn't helpful either.

727
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:48,960
Is it also possible there is a part of you

728
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,160
that is enjoying your own success
too much?

729
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:53,880
What is "too much"?

730
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,440
A smile? A moment's happiness?

731
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:58,440
Overstepping the mark is too much.

732
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,480
I think we do all know when
we've played to the gallery excessively.

733
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,280
We know.

734
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:07,840
All right.

735
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:09,880
Yes.

736
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,400
It does feel good sometimes to be cheered.

737
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,080
It can be a comfort.

738
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:18,440
Since I've joined this family,
it's not been easy.

739
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:22,680
I've been given no help, no support,
just thrown in the deep end,

740
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:25,720
and I think that people out there
can sense that I've suffered,

741
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,280
that I'm undervalued, ignored...

742
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:30,640
I think it's a mistake to assume
that people feel sympathy for us at all.

743
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,120
And I think
it's a mistake to assume they don't.

744
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:39,280
You've seen how the crowds responded to me
in Australia, here too.

745
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:42,440
- Instead of resenting me for it...
- I assure you, no one resents you.

746
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,280
Charles resents me.

747
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:48,280
Anne resents me. And is it possible
that you resent me too?

748
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,880
All I want is to play for the team.

749
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,760
You're the Princess of Wales.

750
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:55,200
- So of course you're part of the team.
- Then show me.

751
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:59,560
This whole thing,
it starts and stops with you.

752
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,760
You're the captain of the team.

753
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:05,960
If you show me love,
approval, and acceptance,

754
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,640
everyone else will follow.

755
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,440
I think
we've gone as far as we can for now.

756
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:13,240
- We can continue another time.
- Don't dismiss me, please.

757
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:14,760
Don't push me away.

758
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,720
- What?
- Mama…

759
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,240
That's all I want.

760
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,760
It's all any of us want from you.

761
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,480
Is it too much to ask?

762
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,080
<i>A hug?</i>

763
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,160
Yes.

764
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,000
What kind of hug?

765
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,840
A tight, rather desperate hug.

766
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:08,720
- I feel sick.
- Yes.

767
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,080
But is it possible that she has a point?

768
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,800
We are rather a tough bunch
in this family.

769
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:21,400
We don't give out much praise
or love or thanks.

770
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:22,480
Mmm.

771
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,320
Perhaps Diana is best placed to...

772
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,200
- Hug everyone else too.
- To connect with the modern world.

773
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,280
And isn't that how the Crown survives

774
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,360
and stays relevant?
By changing with the times.

775
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:36,560
Mmm.

776
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:37,720
Diana…

777
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,120
…is an immature little girl

778
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:43,640
who, in time, will give up her struggles,

779
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:46,280
give up her fight, and bend,

780
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:47,520
as Philip did.

781
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,160
As they all do.

782
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:53,800
And when she bends, she will fit.

783
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,400
And if she doesn't bend, what then?

784
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:57,480
She will break.
