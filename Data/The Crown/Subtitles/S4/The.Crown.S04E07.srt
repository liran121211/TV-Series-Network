68
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,280
Very.

69
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,560
Is it about someone famous?

70
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,520
Yes.
But I must ask you to keep it a secret.

71
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,440
Oh, don't be coy.

72
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,120
I'll be the judge of that when I hear it.

73
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,800
- Ma'am.
- Dazzle.

74
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,560
You're not taking this seriously.

75
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,600
Mm. How can you tell?

76
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,720
This is a huge secret!

77
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,560
It's virtually a state secret.

78
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,160
I'm…

79
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,960
I'm all ears.

80
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,680
And eyes.

81
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,880
- And lips.
- All right.

82
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,920
Did you say lips?

83
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,880
I'm feeling… naughty.

84
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,400
Yes, I can see that.

85
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,680
Mm-hmm.

86
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,760
Ma'am, I have greatly enjoyed
the last few months.

87
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,680
So have I.

88
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,240
And the closeness
that has developed between us.

89
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,720
- Not closeness. Intimacy.
- Oh God…

90
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,320
Please.

91
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,200
<i>There was a time
when the men I loved</i>

92
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,280
<i>would simply leave me for other women.</i>

93
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,440
<i>Now they leave me for the Church.</i>

94
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,520
<i>Who?</i>

95
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,040
- <i>Derek Jennings.
- Dazzle?</i>

96
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,680
- <i>Yes, Dazzle.
- What were you doing with him?</i>

97
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,600
Falling… slightly in love.

98
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,960
- Oh, Margaret!
- Mm.

99
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,400
Colin Tennant said we were
the two most impossible people he knew,

100
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:25,000
that we should be kept apart at all costs
in the interests of public safety.

101
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,640
Like nitrogen and glycerin.

102
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,640
But… he's so handsome.

103
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,360
Yes.

104
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,400
Has an unkind word for everyone.

105
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,600
Which I adore.

106
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,800
And… a touching vulnerability.

107
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:47,960
And because he has found…
happiness as elusive as me,

108
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:53,120
so we discuss all the different ways
that we try to find joy and calm.

109
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,240
- A good brisk walk, I say.
- Mm.

110
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,960
- Yes. That might work for you.
- It does, every time.

111
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,720
But it might not be enough
for the rest of us.

112
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,960
And Dazzle has found the thing
that works best for him.

113
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,400
Which is?

114
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,200
The priesthood.

115
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,320
- Catholic priesthood?
- Yes.

116
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,920
That's the second reason
he was never the right man for you.

117
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,320
The first being?

118
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,560
Well, he's, you know…

119
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,960
a friend of Dorothy.

120
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
- Dazzle?
- Famously, yes.

121
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,600
Are you sure?

122
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,200
But the way he looks at me sometimes…

123
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,120
Hmm.

124
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,320
Describe that.

125
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,280
With great big adoring eyes.

126
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,720
I think you'll find
that's because you're a royal princess,

127
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,240
and he's a raging snob.

128
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,120
Am I that stupid?

129
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,520
Or desperate?

130
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,840
- I don't like the sound of that cough.
- It's fine.

131
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,960
You've been struggling with your chest
for a while.

132
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,960
Should have realized when
he kept suggesting going to the opera.

133
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,840
Oh.

134
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,560
<i>Princess Margaret
is undergoing investigative surgery</i>

135
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,240
<i>at the Royal Brompton Hospital.</i>

136
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,400
<i>The 54-year-old princess,
who was admitted this afternoon,</i>

137
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,000
<i>is unlikely to learn the results
of those procedures for several days,</i>

138
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,280
<i>but royal sources say</i>

139
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,400
<i>she has not been suffering
from any specific ailment.</i>

140
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,880
<i>The hospital has declined
to release further details</i>

141
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,320
<i>on the princess's condition.</i>

142
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,160
<i>It's thought that Princess Margaret
was smoking as many as 60 cigarettes a day</i>

143
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,480
<i>and that would go against…</i>

144
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,960
I think we'll switch this off, shall we?
It's a bit…

145
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,040
<i>Princess Margaret will stay in hospital…</i>

146
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:57,560
Princess Margaret will be fine.
Princess Margaret is in good hands.

147
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,200
- You all right, Katherine?
- John. Come on.

148
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,320
- Don't be difficult now.
- Katherine, come on.

149
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,400
Right.

150
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,040
- Come on. It's bedtime.
- Dolly needs to go to bed, doesn't she?

151
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,080
All together.

152
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,960

Happy birthday, Katherine!

160
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,080
Children-wise, we seem
to do things in twos in this family.

161
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,840
I can honestly say I never wanted four.

162
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,560
A brace would have been
quite enough for me,

163
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,840
but, um, the boss put her foot down,

164
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,040
and after a tough negotiation

165
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,320
on the yacht in Lisbon in a storm…

166
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,040
- Do you remember?
- Yes, I do.

167
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,000
…along came, um, another two…

168
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,240
The B-team!

169
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,720
Yes, the second 11!

170
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,400
…who have been very special.

171
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,440
Not that the first lot aren't special,

172
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,280
but they were expected, I suppose.

173
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,360
Duty.

174
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,480
Whereas the second lot came out of…

175
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,800
I was going to say "pleasure,"
but that's maybe not the right word,

176
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,200
judging by Anne's face!

177
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,920
- What's the word I'm looking for?
- Joy?

178
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,040
Exactly.

179
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,760
Joy.

180
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,960
They were conceived in reconciliation,

181
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,200
and they have bound us all together
and brought great joy.

182
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,280
So please raise your glasses.

183
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,280
Are you sure?

184
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,400
Come on, Margot.

185
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,480
- Steady on.
- Here.

186
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,520
Many happy returns to, um…

187
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,920
I'm sorry. What's your name again?

188
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,080
The runt of the litter,

189
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,240
dear Edward.

190
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,520
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you.

191
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,616
- You want the big piece?
- Yeah!

192
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,000
<i>You can't have all of that!
Come off it.</i>

193
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,600
I'll chop it up in two.

194
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,160
Seeing as it's your sister's birthday,

195
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,240
you get the extra big piece.

196
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,200
Has everyone seen it?

197
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,880
I remember the day
that one was christened.

198
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,000
- Other way round.
- You don't play.

199
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,040
- Shall I play?
- You <i>don't </i>play!

200
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,040
There's a photograph of us
with our babies.

201
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,120
Yes.

202
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,960
You were holding yours
as if it were a bomb.

203
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,440
You looking terribly glum, having just had
another huge row with Tony.

204
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,120
- Mm.
- He was never the right man for you.

205
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,600
Well, I've come to the view
that there is no right man for me.

206
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,400
- Don't say that.
- No, it's true.

207
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,840
Love is a tender kiss for most people.

208
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,560
For me, she saves her sharpest ax.

209
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,080
Well, I am ready for a new chapter…

210
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
without men,

211
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,960
without… cigarettes, without…

212
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,040
Ma'am?

213
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,080
I'm finally ready…

214
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,840
to focus on the one thing
that won't let me down.

215
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,840
What's that?

216
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,920
Us.

217
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,480
My position as a royal.

218
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,440
My duty.

219
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,200
So I come on bended knee

220
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,360
with a familiar request.

221
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,240
Give me as much responsibility as you can.

222
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,080
As many jobs, as much work.

223
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,840
What your sister needs to stay afloat…

224
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,880
is a sense of meaning.

225
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,240
Mm-hmm.

226
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,720
- Look how big his head is.
- You look ridiculous.

227
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,720
Hello, you.

228
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,800
Hello, you.

229
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,640
And hello, him.

230
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,360
- Your Royal Highness.
- Not interrupting, are we?

231
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,000
No, not at all. René is coming at noon.

232
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,400
Oh, a new beau?

233
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,160
No, a new hairdresser.

234
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,520
- Another friend of Dorothy's.
- Ah.

235
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,160
Other than that, nothing, no.

236
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,720
The day stretches before me
like a great yawning void.

237
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,960
So…

238
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,680
What do you want?

239
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,760
It can't be good news,

240
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,800
or you wouldn't have brought Lurch.

241
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,560
Ma'am, we've come to talk to you
about the 1937 Regency Act,

242
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,720
which created a list of senior royals
who could be called on

243
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,960
to deputize for the monarch
on formal occasions.

244
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:19,600
Yes, I know all about that.
I've been stepping in for her for years.

245
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,680
Yes.

246
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:25,480
Uh, but there is a… specific number
of those senior royals,

247
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,560
just six.

248
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,600
Go on.

249
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,480
Well,
the recent 21st birthday of Prince Edward

250
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,840
means that he is now of age,

251
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,240
and as a child of the sovereign's…

252
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,280
well, he ranks higher than you
in the line of succession.

253
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,960
And you will therefore…

254
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,920
be required to relinquish your role
as Counsellor of State.

255
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,560
Don't take that away from me.
It's all I've got.

256
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,320
- Oh, Margaret.
- It makes no sense.

257
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,440
I have the maturity. I have the wisdom,

258
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,440
not to mention the experience.

259
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,000
Edward's a boy.

260
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,480
He's an immature, uselessboy!

261
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,680
That may be,
but we have to play by the rules.

262
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,720
You will have time
to concentrate on your convalescence.

263
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,040
Would you leave us, please?

264
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Leave us.

265
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,120
I don't want more time.

266
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,960
Don't you… see?

267
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,960
Time, it scares me.

268
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,280
It fills me with dread.

269
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,440
I want…

270
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,440
I want something to fill it with.

271
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,560
- Well, you still have your interests.
- Oh please!

272
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,200
- And your friends.
- Friends!

273
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,800
The ones worth knowing,
they're fed up with me.

274
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,520
- Your charities.
- Charities? They don't want me either.

275
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,200
No, not now we have the Princess of Wales,

276
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,720
who's younger, she's nicer, prettier.

277
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,440
- No. Nobody wants this.
- Oh, Margot.

278
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,880
I asked you for just one thing.

279
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,840
To give me work!

280
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,240
A purpose! Dignity.

281
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:35,080
Yes, and if it were up to me,
I would have given it all to you,

282
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,720
the whole show, gladly, from day one.

283
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,800
But it's <i>not.</i>

284
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,280
- So we have to live with it.
- No.

285
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,920
I will have to live with it, not you.
<i>I </i>will!

286
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,360
No.

287
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,360
Ah!

288
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,760
Anne.

289
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,840
Welcome, ma'am.

290
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,720
- Everything all right?
- No.

291
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,160
It turns out
my objection to the Marcoses

292
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,880
has caused a terrible stink
with the board of directors.

293
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,640
"What board of directors?"
I hear you sensibly ask.

294
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,200
The island is a limited company,
it needs a board of directors.

295
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,640
You ever heard anything so absurd?
It's in no one's interests anyway.

296
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,360
Welcome, Your Royal Highness.

297
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,000
Ma'am?

298
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,920
Ma'am?

299
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,600
Ta-da!

300
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,440
All dry.

301
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,480
Lunch?

302
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,520
What a wonderful spot.

303
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,720
You should have seen it in its heyday.

304
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:44,120
It's rather sad now it's neglected,
gone to seed.

305
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,440
Look at these heliconias.

306
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,280
Is that a silk cotton tree?

307
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,360
Hmm?

308
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,880
Yes.

309
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,000
"The challenge for any gardener
is the pruning."

310
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,040
"You need very nimble fingers."

311
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,400
Roddy.

312
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,840
The garden or the neglect?

313
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,360
Sadly, both!

314
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,680
Thank you.

315
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,960
Diana's pregnant again.

316
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,800
Congratulations.

317
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,120
Which one might imagine
would lift the spirits.

318
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:51,160
Instead, an even deeper gloom
seems to have descended on both of us.

319
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,320
We hardly see one another anymore,
and when we do,

320
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,440
we quarrel more than ever.

321
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,080
It's so depressing,

322
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,080
corrosive.

323
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,200
Mm.

324
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,120
And it's left me with no option
but to… start seeing someone.

325
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,120
Yes, I think we all know about that.

326
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,280
No, not Camilla.

327
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,960
I meant…

328
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,880
a professional.

329
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,120
A therapist, to help with the moods.

330
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,760
A headshrinker?

331
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,000
Aunt Margot, you can't call them that.

332
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,640
Has it helped?

333
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,560
It hasn't made things worse.

334
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,680
Mm. Not much of an endorsement.

335
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,440
The reason I bring it up
is I promised Anne

336
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,840
that I would urge <i>you</i>
to try seeing someone too.

337
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,280
Are you both ganging up on me?

338
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,360
We both care.

339
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,680
Why not try back in London?

340
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,520
Anne thinks she's found someone good.

341
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:02,760
It's outrageous that I, an HRH,
should travel to see <i>her.</i>

342
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,240
I gather it's part of the process,

343
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,520
that the patient accept
that they are a patient.

344
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:14,920
Apparently, the healing cannot start
until the grandiosity is diminished.

345
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,280
What grandiosity?

346
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,680
I'm so far down the royal pecking order
these days,

347
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,600
I'm virtually an untouchable.

348
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,760
Here we are.

349
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:38,040
<i>I had therapy once before</i>

350
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,000
<i>in the early days
of my marriage to Lord Snowdon.</i>

351
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,720
<i>The problem we face is I'm…</i>

352
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,240
Well, I'm so opposed to all of this.

353
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,680
I find it pathetic. It violates everything
I was brought up to believe.

354
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,520
What were you brought up to believe?

355
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,000
Self-pity won't get you very far.

356
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,640
You've just got to get on with it.

357
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,560
Well, that's a very common attitude.

358
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,000
It's also quite old-fashioned.

359
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,800
Did you just call me common? And old?

360
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,520
Because that would not be
a good way to start.

361
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,040
So, what made you want to try again?

362
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,520
Ma'am.

363
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,080
Ma'am.

364
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,200
Because…

365
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,080
Well,
I'm ashamed to say I've been feeling…

366
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,000
a little low…

367
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,040
for a while now.

368
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,400
And…

369
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,880
this current slump…

370
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,640
seems to have resisted every…

371
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,880
attempt I've made to muscle through.

372
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,720
Are you aware of anyone else
in your immediate family

373
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,680
struggling with mental health issues?

374
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,080
The Prince of Wales.
He has his ups and downs.

375
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,160
But I wouldn't say that's a condition.
That's just marriage.

376
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,120
The Duke of Gloucester, my uncle.

377
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,760
He got low from time to time.

378
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,840
I only ask because I am aware,

379
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:35,040
through professional colleagues,
of… the sisters.

380
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,680
Sisters?

381
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,040
What sisters?

382
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,080
<i>That's when
she told me about our cousins.</i>

383
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,240
<i>Our first cousins,
Katherine and Nerissa Bowes-Lyon.</i>

384
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,320
Third and fifth daughters
of Mummy's favorite elder brother…

385
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,240
Uncle Jock.

386
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,800
…being locked up

387
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,000
in the Earlswood Institution
for Mental Defectives,

388
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,600
if you please, in Redhill.

389
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,320
Yes, I remember
hearing about Katherine and Nerissa

390
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,160
and their… terrible problems.

391
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,120
But they're long dead.

392
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,240
It's my understanding
they're both very much alive.

393
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,280
But we can check.

394
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,680
What are you doing? That's my button.

395
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,360
Ah. Here we are. <i>Burke's.</i>

396
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,920
- Let me do that. I'll do that.
- No, I'm fine.

397
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,040
Ah.

398
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,800
Here we are. Ooh, heavy!

399
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,160
- Catch!
- Don't you dare!

400
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,280
Not funny. Go carefully.

401
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,400
P, R, S…

402
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,280
Oh, did I just see it?

403
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,600
Mmm…

404
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,560
Oh, yes. Look, here it is.

405
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,080
Nerissa, deceased 1940.

406
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,400
Katherine, deceased 1961.
There it is in black and white.

407
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,200
Both died long ago.

408
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,360
How strange.

409
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,840
I'm not here.

410
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,640
Buckingham Palace.

411
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,360
Who was it?

412
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,640
Mr. Jennings, ma'am.

413
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,400
Dazzle? Hmm.

414
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,560
What did he want?

415
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,040
To let you know he'd be
in London next week for a few days,

416
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,760
in case you had any time.

417
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,040
No.

418
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,440
<i>Mater misericordiae, ora pro nobis…</i>

419
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,720
- You're not praying, are you?
- I am.

420
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,120
<i>Maria, mater gratio…</i>
When was the last time you drove a car?

421
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,080
I drive all the time.
Well, maybe not this particular model.

422
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,680
Anyway, you're a fine one to talk.
You can't drive at all.

423
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,080
At least I recognize my limitations.

424
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,720
I'd have been happy
for the chauffeur to drive us,

425
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,680
but then…

426
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,160
What are you doing?

427
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,800
…well, we wouldn't have been alone.

428
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,120
Why is it so important that we're alone?

429
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,200
What if someone asks me who I am?

430
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,400
- They won't. You're a priest.
- But I'm not.

431
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,320
Not yet. I'm still just a seminarian.

432
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,640
They don't know that.

433
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,800
You still look suitably clerical
and beyond suspicion.

434
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,200
It feels wrong, ma'am.

435
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,680
Deceitful.

436
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,040
You can always confess later. Now go.

437
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,920
Here we go. Just through here.

438
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,480
They are alive, ma'am.

439
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,720
You saw them?

440
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,800
I did.

441
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,560
How were they?

442
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,520
Like children.

443
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,600
<i>But they know who you are.</i>

444
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,000
<i>And they know who your sister is.</i>

445
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,880
<i>They have pictures of the whole family.</i>

446
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,840
<i>Which they know is </i>their <i>family.</i>

447
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,560
- You love that one, don't you?
- Oh yes.

448
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,960
Keeps it in pride of place, she does.

449
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,200
Aww!

450
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,480
Shall I get your cousins to say hello?

451
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,040
Did you say cousins?

452
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,280
- Hello.
- Hello.

453
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,120
And… there are more.

454
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,440
More what?

455
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,240
More relatives.

456
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:15,160
<i>Cousins of theirs, equally afflicted.</i>

457
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,520
- Hello.
- You can sit down here, love.

458
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,120
Wanna sit on the bed?

459
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,680
- All family together.
- Oh, family, yes.

460
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,800
You all right, Nerissa?

461
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,400
Oh, darling!

462
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,360
Oh, what a surprise!
You're just in time for lunch.

463
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,440
Not hungry.

464
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:02,640
Oh. We're starving. We've all been
for long walks this morning.

465
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:06,200
Well, you and I are about go for another.

466
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:09,400
You don't mind
if I steal her away, do you?

467
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,760
No, not at all.

468
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,480
Five.

469
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,040
<i>Five, </i>Mummy!

470
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:23,280
Five members of our close family
locked up and neglected!

471
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,200
What do you expect us to do?

472
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,240
- Behave like human beings.
- Oh, don't be so naive. We had no choice.

473
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,960
They're your nieces.

474
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,600
- Daughters of your favorite brother!
- They were unwell.

475
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,040
Aunt Fenella was overwhelmed.

476
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,920
Then the way
things suddenly changed for all of us,

477
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,440
none of us could have foreseen it.

478
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,720
It? What's it?

479
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,120
The abdication...

480
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,800
No! Not everything
that is wrong with this family

481
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,160
can be explained away by the abdication.

482
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,920
Well,
the abdication <i>did </i>change everything.

483
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,080
You were too young to understand.

484
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,600
Everything.

485
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,760
It's complicated.

486
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,160
No, it's not!

487
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,720
It's wicked, and it's cold-hearted,

488
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,800
and it's cruel.

489
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,120
And it's entirely
in keeping with the ruthlessness

490
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,120
I myself have experienced in this family.

491
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,000
If you're not first in line,

492
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,080
if you're an individual character
with individual needs,

493
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,480
and God forbid an irregular temperament…

494
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,760
If you don't fit the perfect mold of…

495
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:35,040
silent, dutiful supplication,

496
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,600
then you'll be spat out,
or you'll be hidden away,

497
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,600
or, worse, declared dead!

498
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,440
Darwin had nothing on you lot.

499
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,920
Shame on all of you.

500
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,120
- Margaret...
- No.

501
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,680
Margaret!

502
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,920
If I try to explain,

503
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,040
will you at least listen?

504
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,520
The fact is,

505
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:37,600
the moment that man,
your perfidious uncle,

506
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,040
abdicated the throne,

507
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,600
it really did change everything overnight.

508
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,160
I went from being
the wife of the Duke of York,

509
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,520
leading a relatively normal life,

510
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,840
to being Queen

511
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:57,680
and… wife of a king-emperor.

512
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,280
At the same time,
my family, the Bowes-Lyons…

513
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,320
went from being
minor Scottish aristocrats…

514
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:10,880
to having a direct bloodline…
to the Crown…

515
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,040
resulting…

516
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,680
in the children of my brother…

517
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,920
Katherine and Nerissa.

518
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,800
…and their first cousins…

519
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,880
Idonea…

520
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,600
Etheldreda…

521
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,440
And Rosemary.

522
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,880
Yes.

523
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,440
…paying a terrible price.

524
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,040
Why?

525
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,720
Because…

526
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,640
…their illness…

527
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,280
their imbecility...

528
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,080
Don't use those words.

529
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:48,200
Their professionally diagnosed
idiocy and imbecility…

530
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:52,840
would make people question
the integrity of the bloodline.

531
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,720
What?

532
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,960
Can you imagine the headlines
if it were to get out?

533
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,840
What people would say?

534
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:05,200
The hereditary principle
already hangs by such a precarious thread.

535
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,640
Throw in mental illness…

536
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,760
and it's over.

537
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:18,280
The idea that… one family alone
has the automatic birthright to the Crown

538
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,360
is already so hard to justify.

539
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,480
The gene pool of that family…

540
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,720
had better have 100% purity.

541
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:37,840
There have been enough examples
on the Windsor side alone to worry people.

542
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,360
King George III.

543
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,320
Prince John, your uncle.

544
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,280
If you add
the Bowes-Lyon illnesses to that…

545
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,760
the danger is, it becomes untenable.

546
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,960
<i>It's all a family disease, isn't it?</i>

547
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,280
<i>When they… they tell you you can't marry.</i>

548
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,720
<i>When they strip away your official role.</i>

549
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,360
<i>When they side with your husband
as your marriage falls apart.</i>

550
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,280
And now this.

551
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,800
This final…

552
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,040
insult.

553
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,360
That every diminishment,

554
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,440
every…

555
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,760
…rotten…

556
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,760
misfortune…

557
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,800
…is written…

558
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,720
is written in my blood.

559
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,400
So…

560
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,440
without… tiptoeing to protect me

561
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,040
or dressing things up,

562
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,920
tell me the truth.

563
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,840
As well as being born second…

564
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,240
am I destined to be mad, too?

565
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,680
No, ma'am.

566
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:22,560
When I heard you'd…
made the appointment to come today…

567
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,400
I did a little research.

568
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:30,280
Now the genetic fault
responsible for your cousins' condition

569
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,720
seems to have descended
from their common maternal grandfather,

570
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,960
Charles Trefusis, 21st Baron Clinton.

571
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:43,440
This suggests that the recessive gene
responsible for their condition

572
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,760
lies with the Clinton family.

573
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,400
So, how did it get
to the Bowes-Lyon family?

574
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,480
Through your aunt Fenella,

575
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,560
born Clinton,

576
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,920
who married John Bowes-Lyon.

577
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,840
Uncle Jock.

578
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,680
What your cousins suffer from
is a severe developmental disorder.

579
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,360
And whatever issues
you may or may not be facing,

580
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,400
that's not the same thing at all.

581
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,040
It hasn't somehow passed…

582
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,520
to my mother, Queen Elizabeth?

583
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,160
No.

584
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:18,760
But then, if they didn't threaten
the integrity of the royal family,

585
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,560
the girls need never
have been hidden away.

586
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,040
And what my family did was unforgivable.

587
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:50,400
Anyway, she prescribed… medication,

588
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,760
psychotherapy,

589
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,560
and increased exercise.

590
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,000
They'll be suggesting
giving up alcohol soon.

591
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,760
Giving up alcohol.

592
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,680
You could always just convert
and come over to Rome.

593
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,120
- Dazzle.
- It's the only thing that's worked for me.

594
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,560
Lifted my spirits.

595
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,840
Before I became Catholic,
I attended church.

596
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,240
After I converted, I found a faith.

597
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:17,360
- The difference is night and day.
- Now you're being evangelical.

598
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,800
I feel evangelical.
It's not just the beauty,

599
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,360
it's the rigor of the Catholic Church.

600
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,080
It demands complete submission,

601
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:29,520
which strong, willful characters like mine
and, I would suggest, yours, ma'am, need.

602
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,880
Hmm.

603
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,520
One cannot fully receive God

604
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,120
until one has submitted
to something larger,

605
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,160
and the moment I did...

606
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,360
Don't tell me.
The lights went on, you found happiness?

607
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,200
More than happiness.

608
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,040
Ecstasy.

609
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:51,040
And the gloom
we talked about so many times…

610
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,440
the emptiness…

611
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,120
has gone.

612
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,480
How nice.

613
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,840
So come over.

614
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,800
I would,
but in case you hadn't noticed, Dazzle,

615
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,400
I've already submitted
to something larger.

616
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,920
The royal family of the United Kingdom.

617
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
If I became Catholic,

618
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,400
it would be a national scandal.

619
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,880
There'd be talk of betrayal,
second Reformation.

620
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,920
No, they'd make me give up my title
and kick me out.

621
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,280
Would that be so bad?

622
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,600
To free yourself once and for all?

623
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,040
To find happiness?

624
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,360
Why would I?

625
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,240
The title,

626
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:42,200
my seniority, the proximity to the Crown
<i>is </i>my happiness.

627
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,880
It's who I am.
I don't expect you to understand.

628
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,360
No, I don't understand!

629
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:50,600
You've just discovered
terrible things about your family.

630
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:53,480
A system that ignored
five members of its own to protect itself.

631
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:56,240
Will that same system protect you? No!

632
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,800
It doesn't protect anything
except the center.

633
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:02,640
- Those away from the center...
- But I <i>am </i>in the center!

634
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,760
I am in the very center.

635
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,920
I am the Queen's sister,

636
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,640
daughter to a king-emperor,

637
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,880
and I will always be in the center.

638
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,120
Now go, Dazzle.

639
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,680
Back to your ecstatic new family,

640
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,640
and I will struggle on in mine.

641
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:33,240
And I think it would be better
if we… don't see one another again.

642
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:42,800
And…

643
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,880
should you ever… find a moment…

644
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,720
perhaps you will pray for me.

645
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,240
I will.

646
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,600
Your Royal Highness.

00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,680
♪ <i>Yeah, I was ridin' high</i> ♪

648
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:29,200
