1
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,200
Allow a little bit
for the wind, sir.

2
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,800
It's just off to the left.

3
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,760
Adjust the sight to 100 yards.

4
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,480
And we release the lock…

5
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,960
And gently squeeze the trigger.

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Is dead?

7
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,240
No.

8
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,960
You hit him, sir,
but that's him away now, wounded.

9
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,440
- So we go after him.
- No. No, no.

10
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,080
See that wee stream down there?

11
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,880
That is the border where our estate ends
and our neighbor's estate begins.

12
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,840
And we never cross that line, ever.

13
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,240
- Morning, Your Majesty.
- Morning.

14
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,080
Just to say that the prime minister

15
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,520
and Mr. Thatcher are expected to arrive
at around 3:00 p.m. tomorrow.

16
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,280
Thank you.

17
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,360
- What's all the excitement?
- Morning, Mummy.

18
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,960
- Good morning.
- Morning, Mummy.

19
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,200
- Morning.
- Are you going to tell her or am I?

20
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,280
Go on. I can see you're bursting to.

21
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,040
Our head gamekeeper had a telephone call
this morning from the neighboring estate.

22
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,680
It seems one of their commercial guests…

23
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,160
Japanese, apparently.

24
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,800
…shot and wounded a grand stag,

25
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,920
which has now crossed over
onto Crown land and needs...

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,280
Needs finishing off
on compassionate grounds.

27
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,280
- Am I telling this or are you?
- Well, get on with it, then.

28
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,160
Anyway.

29
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,680
It's an imperial, apparently.

30
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,000
- Fourteen points.
- Really?

31
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,360
Hence the excitement,

32
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,520
hence us changing all our plans
so that we can get out there today.

33
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,840
- But we have engagements.
- Not anymore.

34
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,880
- I've canceled everything.
- What?

35
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,960
Come on, Mummy.

36
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,440
We all know there hasn't been one that big
shot on this estate since…

37
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,520
And it might be nice
to find one to rival him.

38
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,640
- Eclipse him.
- A rival and enemy.

39
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,720
Glowering at him across the room.

40
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,960
Question is,
whose name will be underneath it?

41
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,040
- Mine.
- Mine.

42
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,640
- Mine.
- Mine.

43
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,720
- No, <i>mine. </i>There's not a question.
- Well, it won't be yours.

44
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,240
- Mine.
- Stop it!

45
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,880
Mine.

46
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,000
You were very kind to have come.

47
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,320
Oh, I loved it. I adore Verdi.

48
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,720
He's so… so romantic.

49
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,880
Yes. But to focus simply on romance

50
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,000
diminishes Verdi's legacy
and political influence.

51
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,960
His music played such a key role
in the Italian unification, too.

52
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,560
Gosh. Really?

53
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,520
Do you have a busy summer?

54
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,600
No, I'll be in London for most of it.

55
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,680
I'm embarrassingly available,
if that's what you're asking.

56
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,080
I'll be in Zimbabwe for a couple of weeks
and then Scotland.

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,240
But perhaps we can meet again
in the autumn.

58
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,320
- Oh dear. You'd rather not.
- No, it's just such a long way away.

59
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,200
- Oh, it'll fly by!
- No, it won't.

60
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,880
It'll drag horribly. But all good things
come to those who wait.

61
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,080
Your chaperone
would never allow anything more.

62
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,600
She'll do whatever you tell her.
Granny's the most hideous snob.

63
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,960
Good night.

64
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,720
- Was that very frigid?
- Yes.

65
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,680
- But perfectly gentlemanly.
- Princely.

66
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,360
Sorry. Princely.

67
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,960
<i>I thought we might begin today
with plans for the forthcoming Budget,</i>

68
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:20,440
<i>which the chancellor and I
have now had an opportunity to discuss.</i>

69
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,800
<i>Given the very pressing need</i>

70
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:28,560
to bring public sector borrowing
and inflation under control,

71
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,640
this government will embark
on what Geoffrey has confirmed

72
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,840
is one of the boldest
and most far-reaching programs

73
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:41,000
<i>of fiscal correction
this country has ever known.</i>

74
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,800
With respect, Margaret…

75
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,680
Four <i>billion </i>in spending cuts?

76
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,680
<i>Strict new spending limits
on government departments,</i>

77
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,320
<i>the abolition
of the 25 pence rate of tax…</i>

78
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,120
<i>This </i>isn't <i>a correction.</i>

79
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,360
- It's butchery.
- You're trying to move too fast.

80
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,160
That is because I am in a hurry.

81
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,440
- Anyone with any experience...
- Or sense.

82
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,800
…would see that the decimation
of the public sector and heavy industry

83
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,800
would risk the specter
of mass unemployment…

84
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,200
Social unrest.

85
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,000
And fly in the face
of everything we stand for.

86
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,920
Hear, hear.

87
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,400
<i>Remind me.</i>

88
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,600
<i>What is it we stand for?</i>

89
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,880
<i>We are the Conservative Party.</i>

90
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,040
<i>We stand for conservatism, caution.</i>

91
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,360
Stability.

92
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,480
Moderation.

93
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,880
Thank you, gentlemen.
Prime Minister.

94
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,720
<i>These are our priorities,</i>

95
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:38,280
<i>not some wholesale reconfiguration
of the state and its institutions.</i>

96
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,280
<i>It's too rash, it's too reckless,</i>

97
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,960
and you risk
turning not only the country against us

98
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,480
but your own party,

99
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,360
your own colleagues, <i>us, </i>against you.

100
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:52,640
Nice and still, please.
Three, two, one.

101
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,400
Thank you.

102
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,800
The way those men patronize me,

103
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,160
lecture me.

104
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,880
Those squires and grandees…

105
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,680
Upper-class bastards.

106
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,760
And their ideas,

107
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,320
their solutions
to the problems this country faces,

108
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:18,360
so unimaginative, and cautious, and…

109
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,440
wet.

110
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,400
Speaking of wet,

111
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,280
that's the forecast for Balmoral.

112
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,040
So no golf for yours truly.

113
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,160
My father used to give a sermon.

114
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:39,440
"God needs no faint hearts
for his ambassadors."

115
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,160
They are faint hearts.

116
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,240
And I should have kicked them out
when I had the chance.

117
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,680
I had a call
from Malcolm Muggeridge this morning,

118
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,000
who said, "Watch out for the tests."

119
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,840
"Oh, which tests?" said I.

120
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,920
"The infamous Balmoral tests," said he.

121
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,520
Apparently, the royal family
routinely subject all their guests

122
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,600
to secret tests, to find out whether
someone is acceptable or not acceptable.

123
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,920
U or non-U, part of the gang
or not part of the gang.

124
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,280
Apparently, it's ruthless,

125
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,680
a blood sport in itself.

126
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,400
Prime Minister.

127
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,200
- Welcome to Balmoral Castle.
- Yes.

128
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,560
- Mr. Thatcher.
- How do you do?

129
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,000
Her Majesty asked me to apologize
for not meeting you in person,

130
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,720
but she's out stalking
with the rest of the family.

131
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,320
Oh, where…

132
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,240
Ah…

133
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,320
Oh yes. Well, we'll take this one, dear,
thank you.

134
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,840
They're both yours, ma'am.

135
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,240
Oh.

136
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,520
Well…

137
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,160
Thank you, dear.

138
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,880
No, it's all right. It's English money,
but you can spend it in Scotland.

139
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,120
It's not that, sir.
Tips are left at the end of the stay.

140
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,880
Instructions are on the protocol sheet
on the table.

141
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,080
Oh. Well, go on.
Take it anyway. Won't tell a soul.

142
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,720
No, no, dear, I like to do that myself,
especially for my husband.

143
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,680
- Sorry, ma'am.
- Thank you.

144
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,440
Unpacking your bag?

145
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,040
What was she thinking?
That's a wife's job.

146
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,520
And two bedrooms.

147
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,320
I know. It's all very odd.

148
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,520
Are we allowed to sleep in one bed?

149
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,680
I shall go and check
with the protocol sheet.

150
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,640
What do you think 6:00 p.m. is?
Drinks or dinner?

151
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,160
Oh, who knows?

152
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,840
- What do I wear?
- What the heck? Who cares?

153
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,840
Well, I care.

154
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,120
Every house has rules,

155
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,320
and places like this
are all about what you wear and when.

156
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,880
On the plane, you said there were tests.

157
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,680
- Oh. So you did hear what I said.
- Of course I heard what you said.

158
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,216
I don't need to look at you to show you
I'm listening to what you're saying.

159
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,640
Well, it might be nice.

160
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,720
I don't have the time to be nice.

161
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,160
Well, I'm sure to worry about it all
would be to fail the tests.

162
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,960
6:00 p.m. is drinks before dinner.

163
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,200
Dinner is black-tie,
ergo drinks are black-tie.

164
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,360
I couldn't help noticing, ma'am,
you didn't bring any outdoor shoes.

165
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,840
That's right.

166
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,160
Hmm.

167
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,280
What a strange thing to say.

168
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,080
Did anyone actually see him?

169
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,920
Anne caught a glimpse
out by Connachcraig.

170
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,480
Did you get a shot off?

171
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,000
- Not for you either?
- No. How about this lot?

172
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,760
Bit early in the season, isn't he?

173
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,000
Most of the hinds
haven't come on heat yet.

174
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,960
Most likely in rut
and had broken out of the herd.

175
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,200
We'll have to get you
another crack at it.

176
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,440
We'll get him tomorrow.

177
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,280
Now let's sort out some tea.

178
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,360
I'd love a whole pot.

179
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,360
Right.

180
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,640
- Where to now?
- Oh, I hear something.

181
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,520
Oh, I do believe…

182
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,880
- Here?
- Yes.

183
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,320
Ah.

184
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,200
What are they doing?

185
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,400
Christ.

186
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,280
Prime Minister. How nice to see you.

187
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,720
Your Majesty.

188
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,840
And dressed
for dinner already.

189
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,280
How very thoughtful of you.

190
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,280
- We shall have supper early.
- Don't be ridiculous.

191
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,760
It's six o'clock.

192
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,960
Tell the kitchens we'll eat in 45 minutes.

193
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,520
But it's teatime.

194
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,160
Good boy.

195
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,360
Your Majesty.

196
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,080
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

197
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,000
Your Royal Highness.

198
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:37,080
Christ, do we think they'll come
to lunch tomorrow in their pajamas?

199
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,640
Well, I think we've failed that test.

200
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,200
Good evening. Ma'am, you're sitting
second from the end on the right,

201
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,880
and sir, you're sitting on the left…

202
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,200
I could have sworn
I heard him at one point.

203
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,600
- Did you call back?
- Yes, I tried. Erm…

204
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,680
Yes.

205
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,560
Mark, you do it better.

206
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,720
That is absolutely terrible.

207
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,280
Louder.

208
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,960
Did I hear there was a sighting
on the western shore of the loch?

209
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,360
Ridiculous suggestion.

210
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,080
- Why is that?
- Low ground. It's too open.

211
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,880
No, the high tops and the ridges.

212
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,480
That's where you'll find him.

213
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,440
- I see.
- Am I right?

214
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:41,880
…criminal offense to kill a perfectly
healthy breeding stag like that.

215
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,360
But commercial guests want trophies

216
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,880
and are prepared to pay
huge amounts of money,

217
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,200
and our neighbors
are greedy enough to take it.

218
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,400
I have some sympathy.

219
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,600
It's business.

220
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,400
It's not business.

221
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,680
It's conservation.

222
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,680
This is what people fail to understand.
It's pure ignorance.

223
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,680
Now,
how about a round of games after supper?

224
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,440
Number five ibble-dibble
with one dibble-ibble

225
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,720
calling number four ibble-dibble
with two dibble-ibbles! Ahh!

226
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,520
That was the best I've ever done it.

227
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,760
Number four ibble-dibble
with two dibble-ibbles

228
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,800
calling number seven ibble-dibble
with one, two, three, four…

229
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,880
eight dibble-ibbles!

230
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,360
So, number seven dibble-bibble...

231
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,720
- Oh, Mummy!
- No, you bibbled!

232
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,720
Oh no!

233
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,760
Margot, show Granny how it's done.

234
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,040
Tippity-toppity, down with the Nazis!

235
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,840
Number three ibble-dibble
with two dibble-ibbles

236
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,040
calling…

237
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,800
number one ibble-dibble…

238
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,120
…with <i>no </i>dibble-ibbles.

239
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,400
- Oh. That's you again.
- Good luck, Prime Minister.

240
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,080
All right.

241
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,880
Oh, thank you.

242
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,920
Number one ibble-dibble…

243
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,800
with no dibble-ibbles…

244
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,160
calling number…

245
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,240
ten…

246
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,880
ibble-dibble

247
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,960
with…

248
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,120
six dibble-ibbles.

249
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,200
Oh, dear.

250
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,000
- Well done.
- Did I get that right?

251
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,920
Yes, you did. Very good.

252
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,720
Would you mind
passing that down?

253
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,280
Great.

254
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,400
Well done.

255
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,120
- <i>What </i>was<i> she doing?
- She was rather hopeless.</i>

256
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,360
But I'm willing to give her
the benefit of the doubt.

257
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,080
It was probably just nerves.

258
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,280
Of what?

259
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,560
Of the situation,
of where she finds herself.

260
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,840
We were playing parlor games,
having fun.

261
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,720
Perhaps her idea of fun
is something else entirely.

262
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,520
Or she's incapable of it

263
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,240
and wouldn't know fun
if it bit her on the backside.

264
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,120
Well, I've taken pity on her
and invited her stalking tomorrow.

265
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,680
Good luck with that!

266
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,080
Good night.

267
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,240
Oh Lord,
you're not gonna start work now, are you?

268
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,840
Well, what choice do I have
after wasting a whole evening like that?

269
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,440
Oh, come on! A bit of harmless fun.

270
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,160
To make matters worse,

271
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,040
the Queen has invited me
to join her stalking tomorrow morning.

272
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:39,440
Yes, you laugh, but it means
I have to get ahead of the work now.

273
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,920
All right, then. Why don't I go
and sleep in the other room?

274
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,680
Don't you dare!

275
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,880
We don't want to catch
any upper-class habits.

276
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,440
Those that sleep apart grow apart.

277
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,760
It's just for one night.

278
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,960
And that's precisely how bad habits start.

279
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,280
So you can stay here, and…

280
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,760
well, there's a book on the bedside table.

281
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,720
Very well, dear, whatever you say.

282
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,880
I didn't realize…

283
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,560
<i>- Hunting Memoirs of Balmoral Castle.</i>
- Oh yes.

284
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,640
You read that while I do this.

285
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,080
Oh, I can't wait.

286
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,560
"Fifth of September, 1848."

287
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,000
"A letter from Prince Albert to Marie,

288
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,600
Dowager Duchess of Saxe-Coburg"!

289
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,880
"The rain has not stopped

290
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,960
for one minute since we arrived,

291
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,880
but it has not prevented me, naughty man,

292
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,080
from spending the whole week
creeping stealthily after glorious stags."

293
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,040
Stay.

294
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,200
Yesterday, actually,
her performance was quite poor.

295
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,400
Yes, I'm making myself odds-on
to bring him back by lunch.

296
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,000
Ha! I'll take you on that bet.

297
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,320
Better put your money where your mouth is.

298
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,280
Where is she?
He's most active in the morning.

299
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,240
I don't want to lose my shot.

300
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,760
Oh God!

301
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,960
Say nothing.

302
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,800
Prime Minister.

303
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,560
What a lovely morning.

304
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,560
Shall we?

305
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,040
We're in here.

306
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,120
We're in this one.

307
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,320
Thank you, John.

308
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,440
Come on, boy. Come on.

309
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,600
I'm so glad
you agreed to join us.

310
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,880
I didn't have you down as a sportswoman.

311
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,960
I'm not, ma'am.

312
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,360
I'm afraid we're all mad stalkers.

313
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,320
It was how I spent some happy times
with my father, King George.

314
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,600
- He taught me everything.
- My father taught me a great deal too.

315
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,640
What did you do together?

316
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,600
We worked.

317
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,640
Work was our play.

318
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,400
I worked with him in our shop.

319
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,120
As an alderman, he took me everywhere.

320
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,000
I watched as he wrote his speeches

321
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,280
and listened
as he rehearsed and delivered them.

322
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,640
It was my political baptism.

323
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,560
How lovely for you both.

324
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,080
Yes.

325
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,040
Now,
if you don't want to break your ankles,

326
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,720
you should have a think about those.

327
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,720
What size are you?

328
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,640
Five.

329
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,560
Oh, that's handy! Me too.

330
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,200
When stalking, the trick, really,
is to disappear into nature,

331
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,120
to preserve the element of surprise.

332
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,160
So next time,
you might not wear bright blue.

333
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,320
It means the stag can see you.

334
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,560
Or wear scent.

335
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,120
It means he can smell you.

336
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,720
Oh!

337
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,200
And now he can hear you, too.

338
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,120
I could go back and change.

339
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,480
Oh, that's an idea!

340
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,000
If you hurry,
you can make it back in time for lunch.

341
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,480
I'll be as quick as I can.

342
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,520
Ma'am.

343
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,400
<i>Ah, Mary.</i>

344
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,560
I'll drive out and join them for lunch.

345
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,080
Do we know where?

346
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,800
I think I heard them saying they're going
to the Loch Muick beach, ma'am.

347
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,120
Ah, yes.

348
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,320
No.

349
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,440
What are you doing?

350
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,040
Oh… Ah.

351
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,760
Your Royal Highness.

352
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,000
Aren't you supposed to be
out there stalking?

353
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,880
Yes, I was, but your sister...

354
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,200
No, you don't call her that.
You call her "the Queen."

355
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,200
She's the Queen, <i>not </i>my sister.

356
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,520
And that chair, no one sits in that chair.

357
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,560
- Oh, I beg your pardon.
- God, don't say that either.

358
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,640
Say "What?"

359
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,760
Begging for anything is desperate.

360
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,120
Begging for pardon is common.

361
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,360
That chair…

362
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,560
no one sits in that chair.

363
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,280
It's Queen Victoria's chair.

364
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,280
Oh.

365
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,760
And you do realize
this is supposed to be a bank holiday?

366
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:12,400
Yes, although it is hard to have a holiday

367
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,200
when the country is in its current state.

368
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,280
Mm. The country
has been in a state before.

369
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,360
It will doubtless be in a state again.

370
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,120
One learns,
when one has the benefit of experience,

371
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:28,360
that sometimes time off
is the most sensible course of action.

372
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,000
Hm. Well, I'm not best suited to time off.

373
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,200
It gives me no pleasure.

374
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,120
It might give you
something more important than that.

375
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,240
Perspective.

376
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,480
Good evening, Your Royal Highness.

377
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,240
Is there nothing I can say
to persuade you to come for the weekend?

378
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,400
<i>Why? I have no place up there.</i>

379
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,480
<i>And I'm busy anyway.</i>

380
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,720
Doing what?

381
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,600
What is so important that you decline
an invitation from the heir to the throne?

382
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,680
<i>Being a mother.</i>

383
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,120
And a wife.

384
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,680
<i>- Well, it's never stopped you before.</i>
- Now, now.

385
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,840
It's true.

386
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:41,320
<i>You need to find a young woman who's free
to be where you want when you want</i>

387
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,520
<i>and is willing
to give up her life for you.</i>

388
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,600
Like this new one.

389
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,920
Diana Spencer?

390
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,120
<i>Mightn't she fit the bill?</i>

391
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,040
Don't say that.

392
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,520
I'd much rather hear how jealous you are.

393
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,760
<i>I would be, but…</i>

394
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,480
it's not helpful, is it?

395
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,120
Given the situation we find ourselves in.

396
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,320
What's now required of you.

397
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,280
I'm serious. You should ring her.

398
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,920
<i>And say what?</i>

399
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,800
"I can't stop thinking about you."

400
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,520
<i>"I can't bear to wait the whole summer
before seeing you."</i>

401
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,600
<i>"Any chance you could drop everything
and come up to Scotland now?"</i>

402
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,760
<i>Members of Mrs. Thatcher's
cabinet have expressed their alarm</i>

403
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,520
<i>at new figures showing a sharp rise
in the rate of unemployment.</i>

404
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,720
<i>Unions are blaming the increase
on the continued commitment</i>

405
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,560
<i>to a policy of wide-ranging spending cuts.</i>

406
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,520
<i>This is now
a very worrying situation indeed.</i>

407
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,200
<i>We have the most incompetent
and radical Labour opposition</i>,

408
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,800
<i>that should be in the wilderness,
now snapping at our heels.</i>

409
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,160
<i>No one would doubt the strength
of the prime minister's convictions.</i>

410
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,800
<i>But what we need is a mature
and more experienced leader</i>

411
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,120
<i>who shares our values.</i>

412
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:41,760
<i>The danger is, we have a prime minister
whose inexperience,</i>

413
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,280
<i>whose unwillingness to recognize
that her policy is failing</i>

414
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,640
<i>might very well
lead us over the cliff edge.</i>

415
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,200
<i>I think that many in cabinet
will now be asking</i>

416
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,160
<i>if it isn't time for a change.</i>

417
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:57,200
<i>Francis Pym is definite
about Mrs. Thatcher's monetarism policy…</i>

418
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,920
<i>Next up,
we've got Mark Watson from Jedburgh,</i>

419
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,440
<i>current record holder for the hammer throw
here in Braemar.</i>

420
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,400
<i>He has got to beat
Francis Stewart from Fort William.</i>

421
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,000
<i>Just back from injury,
he managed to throw it</i>

422
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,080
<i>eighty-four feet.</i>

423
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,040
What am I doing here?

424
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,720
Miles from Westminster,

425
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,400
miles from reality,

426
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,480
wasting precious time in some…

427
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,600
Half-Scottish, half-Germanic cuckoo-land?

428
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,800
Yes.

429
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,480
<i>Here's local boy Gary McNeil…</i>

430
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,000
<i>Here we go.</i>

431
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:00,600
<i>Here's the Duke of Edinburgh handing over
this year's haggis to young…</i>

432
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,000
And I'm struggling to find

433
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,640
any redeeming features
in these people at all.

434
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,720
<i>Remember,
the haggis must be fit to eat…</i>

435
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,560
They aren't sophisticated, or cultured,

436
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,160
or elegant, or anything close to an ideal.

437
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,880
- They're…
- Boorish, snobbish, and rude?

438
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,680
Yes, DT.

439
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,040
Just like those patronizing bullies
within my own cabinet.

440
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,360
Mm.

441
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,320
All members of a certain class,
you'll notice.

442
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,760
Well,

443
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,200
if this country
really is to turn the corner,

444
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,120
then I say
it needs to change fundamentally.

445
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,680
Top to bottom.

446
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,400
Yes, just put that there.
Thank you. Thank you very much.

447
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,040
Jolly good. Thank you.

448
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,320
What happened?

449
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,400
- There was a crisis, apparently.
- Huh.

450
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,440
Life in post-war Britain

451
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:30,120
has been one long, painful,
uninterrupted crisis.

452
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,280
But no matter how bad things got,

453
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,640
none of the other prime ministers
left early.

454
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,040
- No, one could scarcely get rid of them.
- Hmm.

455
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,560
So how come this one
can't get away fast enough?

456
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,560
Perhaps we weren't very friendly.

457
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,960
What are you talking about?
I was incredibly friendly.

458
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,040
I positively gushed.

459
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,960
Who's that?

460
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,520
- Lady Diana.
- Hello.

461
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,176
- Welcome to Balmoral Castle.
- Thank you.

462
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,560
- Lady Fermoy is here for you.
- Oh.

463
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,360
Hello, Granny.

464
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,280
I hope I don't need to tell you

465
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,840
how fortunate you are
to have been invited here,

466
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,760
how unique an opportunity this is…

467
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,400
or how much is potentially at stake
for our family.

468
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,240
It's just a weekend.

469
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,080
The most important weekend of your life.

470
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,520
The Prince of Wales
has kindly promised to take me fishing.

471
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,600
I'm hoping
it'll be my first time in Scotland

472
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,960
when I manage to catch something
other than a cold.

473
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,840
I can't keep up. Is this one
a <i>friend</i> friend or a girlfriend?

474
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,960
In the balance, I think,

475
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,840
hence the invitation up here
to see if she sinks…

476
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,160
or swims.

477
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,560
I learned very quickly that wasn't right.

478
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,880
Not that I've ever
had much more luck with a gun.

479
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,200
Good morning, ma'am. 5:30.

480
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,160
His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh

481
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,880
has requested you accompany him
stalking this morning.

482
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,280
Gosh.

483
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,880
- All right.
- Will you be needing anything?

484
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,520
Well, like what?

485
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,680
I just thought,
in case you have no outdoor shoes…

486
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,600
I only brought outdoor shoes.

487
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,680
Hmm.

488
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,920
I apologize for the early start,

489
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,400
but there's a reason
I asked you to join me this morning.

490
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:58,080
There's great excitement
gripping the household.

491
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:01,920
Oh, yes, the stag. It's all anyone
could talk about at dinner last night.

492
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,640
I don't mean about the stag.

493
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,960
I mean about you.

494
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:12,160
I thought this might be a time
for us to get to know one another.

495
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,040
Are you sure this isn't too wet?

496
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,480
No, I love a good watering.

497
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,440
You don't mind a bit of mud?

498
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:39,520
Muckier the better.
I'm a country girl at heart.

499
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,520
Good.

500
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,440
So I suppose I must have seen you
growing up on the estate at Sandringham

501
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,280
when you lived in the cottage there.

502
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,240
Yes, sir.

503
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,720
Where do you live now?

504
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:47,800
London, Earl's Court,
in a flat with three girlfriends.

505
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,120
I'm the bossy landlady.

506
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,440
Are you bossy?

507
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,600
- I like things to be neat and tidy.
- Quite right, so do I.

508
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,440
Does that come from the army, sir?

509
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,600
The navy.
And I'm the one asking the questions.

510
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,080
Sorry.

511
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,120
So is that what you do all day?
Be a landlady?

512
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,280
Oh, no, sir. My main job's
as my sister's cleaning lady.

513
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,320
Right.
Well, that's a very important job.

514
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,400
Yes, it is.

515
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,040
- I hope she pays you properly.
- One pound an hour.

516
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,240
Sorry, I don't know what
the going rates are for domestic cleaning.

517
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,560
Well, that's a very top rate.

518
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,000
Only for the very best
executive-level cleaners.

519
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,720
- Is it?
- No!

520
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,560
It's a complete rip-off.
I don't know why I do it.

521
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,840
Perhaps because you enjoy cleaning.

522
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,000
Actually, I do quite enjoy cleaning.

523
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,000
And ironing.
God, does that make me tragic?

524
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:56,200
No, it makes you fascinating.
I can't wait to discuss it further.

525
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,040
- Sir.
- What?

526
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,920
- Look.
- Oh yes.

527
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,040
Oh, you clever, clever thing.

528
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,040
- Shouldn't we try and get closer?
- No.

529
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,720
We'll never get another chance.

530
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,640
We have one shot at this.

531
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,520
Where's the wind coming from? The right?

532
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,240
It's the left, sir.

533
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,720
- What?
- Well, look at the clouds.

534
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,640
It's swirling.

535
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,440
No, I say the right.

536
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,960
It's the left.

537
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,720
Good shot, sir.

538
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,400
Was it from the left?

539
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,080
They have!

540
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,680
Look.

541
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,160
Gosh.

542
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,600
So we found him, yes.

543
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,880
What a triumph!

544
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,840
- Gosh, they've got him.
- Well done.

545
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,240
He's a beauty.

546
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,680
I have Diana to thank.

547
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:11,120
- No, I did nothing.
- No, you, uh, you spotted him, not me.

548
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,520
But you shot him, sir.

549
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,120
It wasn't an easy shot.

550
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,960
- No.
- It was brilliant.

551
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,800
Right,
let's get a closer look, shall we?

552
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,480
Walking four hours before we found him.

553
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,856
- Four?
- Four.

554
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,960
- A single shot?
- A single shot.

555
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,840
Mummy, it's impressive, isn't it?

556
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,320
Thank you so much for coming.

557
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,880
- Has it been awful?
- Not at all. It's been heavenly.

558
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,440
No one's ever said<i> that</i>
after their first visit.

559
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,800
But it has been.

560
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:20,440
- You weren't put off by all the scrutiny?
- My family's just as bad.

561
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,240
Anyone new, everyone tortures them
trying to catch them out.

562
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,760
I'll get all the reports tomorrow.

563
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,520
Let me know if I passed.

564
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,880
I'm sure you have.

565
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,920
With distinction.

566
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,800
You've been a great sport.

567
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,720
Thank you.

568
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,760
<i>So…</i>

569
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,840
<i>how's it going up there?</i>

570
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,360
<i>You don't want to know.</i>

571
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,880
I do, actually.

572
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,720
Talk to me.

573
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,440
She's a triumph.

574
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,520
<i>In the history of Balmoral,</i>

575
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:33,400
no one has ever passed the test
with such flying colors.

576
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,560
Well, well, well.

577
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:42,160
<i>Rave reviews
from the whole ghastly politburo.</i>

578
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,440
<i>Anne, Papa,</i>

579
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,160
<i>Margot,</i>

580
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,560
<i>Mummy, Granny.</i>

581
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,240
Your Royal Highness, the Duke of Edinburgh
has asked to see you.

582
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,680
<i>Then I was summoned
for a conversation with Papa</i>

583
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,280
<i>in the hanging room, where,</i>

584
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:05,520
oblivious to the grotesque symbolism,

585
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:09,200
it might as well have been me
strung up and skinned.

586
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,560
You asked to see me?

587
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,000
That Diana Spencer.

588
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,600
What about her?

589
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:21,120
He made the family position
painfully clear.

590
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,320
They want me to marry her.

591
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,560
Gosh.

592
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:41,920
<i>Yes.</i>

593
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,200
She really <i>was</i> a triumph.

594
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,560
<i>This was always going to happen.</i>

595
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,160
The right one was always
going to come along.

596
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,920
But is she the right one?

597
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,960
Is anyone actually asking themselves that?

598
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,920
She's a child.

599
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:57,960
The Prime Minister, Your Majesty.

600
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:00,920
Your Majesty.

601
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:10,160
- I do hope you enjoyed your holiday.
- Very much.

602
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,840
Scotland in the summer is such a blessing.

603
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:16,760
I'm always mystified by those
that don't feel at home at Balmoral.

604
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,400
Some people just don't.

605
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,880
They come and are bewildered by it,

606
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,360
by the weather and traditions.

607
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,240
They see only cruelty in the blood sports

608
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,320
instead of kindness or necessity.

609
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,760
But there have been blood sports here too.

610
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,160
- You have a brand-new cabinet.
- I have.

611
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,920
Mostly older ministers that were culled.

612
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:42,040
Yes, although it wasn't
just their age that decided it.

613
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:45,160
- Rather?
- Their background, mostly.

614
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,880
And lack of grit,

615
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:53,120
as a consequence of their privilege
and entitlement.

616
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,960
Always a mistake to assume
just because people are privileged,

617
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,160
they lack grit.

618
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,960
And a dangerous game, I think,
to make enemies left, right, and center.

619
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,840
Not if one is comfortable
with having enemies.

620
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:08,920
Are you?

621
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:10,840
Oh yes.

622
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:15,720
Inspired by the words
of the Chartist poet Charles Mackay.

623
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,440
"You have no enemies, you say?:

624
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:23,760
"Alas! My friend, the boast is poor."

625
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,480
"He, who has mingled in the fray

626
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:29,520
Of duty, that the brave endure,

627
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:33,800
Must have made foes! If you have none,

628
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:37,440
Small is the work that you have done."

629
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:41,160
"You've hit no traitor on the hip,

630
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:45,520
You've dashed no cup from perjured lip,

631
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:49,720
You've never turned the wrong to right,

632
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:53,440
You've been a coward in the fight."

633
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:06,000
<i>Good evening. Well, so now we know.
Three cabinet ministers sacked,</i>

634
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:09,440
<i>the cabinet changes,
and a long list of promotions</i>

635
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,840
<i>and demotions in the junior ranks.</i>

636
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,160
<i>Mrs. Thatcher
has well and truly shuffled her cabinet.</i>

637
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,800
<i>- Well, in a moment, we'll be looking…</i>
- Ah.

638
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,600
Eeyore.

639
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:24,760
- I came to see how you were getting on.
- I'll be fine.

640
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:28,080
Could you be
a bit more than fine just once?

641
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:32,080
After a selection process
that involved half of Britain,

642
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,120
you've somehow
stumbled on the perfect one

643
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,880
in age, looks, and breeding.

644
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:40,360
Or have you managed to find fault
even in perfection?

645
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,440
No.

646
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,480
No, she is…

647
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,440
undeniably gorgeous.

648
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:47,520
Those legs.

649
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,480
Cow.

650
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,640
And appropriate.

651
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:54,920
Well, then…

652
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,520
I just wish I'd had more time.

653
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,200
What for?

654
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:05,400
Well, to find out who she is.
We hardly know one another.

655
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:09,160
- There'll be time for that later.
- That's what everyone keeps saying.

656
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:12,080
"There'll be time for that later,
just get on with it."

657
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,200
I concur.

658
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:24,680
What does you-know-who say?

659
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,840
Depressingly, she's all for it.

660
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,000
Of course she is.

661
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:33,600
Everyone's all for it
because everyone understands

662
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,520
it's time to finally close this chapter.

663
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:41,520
To put the whole Parker Bowles
soap opera behind us.

664
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:44,120
All of us.

665
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:45,920
For good.

666
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:50,840
Yes.

667
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,320
Oh, was that a smile?

668
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:55,840
It will be soon.

669
00:50:58,680 --> 00:50:59,680
Don't fight it.

670
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:01,800
She's perfect.

671
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,760
She even got the stag, damn her!

672
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,520
It must be written in the stars.
