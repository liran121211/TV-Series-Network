1
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,920
<i>The Prince of Wales, Your Majesty.</i>

2
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Thank you.

3
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,560
It's done.

4
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,800
I did it.

5
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,960
- Where?
<i>- In the nursery.</i>

6
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,040
I wanted to talk to you…

7
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,440
Nursery?

8
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,480
Hardly the most romantic setting.

9
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,800
Did you get on one knee?

10
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,680
No, I didn't.

11
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,560
<i>- And I'm surprised by the question.</i>
- Why?

12
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,240
I thought, in terms of rank,

13
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,840
the Prince of Wales only ever knelt
before the sovereign.

14
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,520
He didn't say that.

15
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,960
What did you say?

16
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,680
I said, "It's a proposal of marriage,
dear, not a show of strength."Hmm.

17
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,040
After all that, did she at least accept?

18
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,560
Yes.

19
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,680
Yes.

20
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,880
What did she say?

21
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,840
Yes, please.

22
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,240
That it was
the happiest moment of her life.

23
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,960
Aw…

24
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,200
Aw…

25
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,560
Aw.

26
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,480
Congratulations.

27
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,360
- Then what?
- I sent her back to London.

28
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,880
<i>♪ Boy, you turn me… ♪</i>

29
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,136
- <i>Where does she live?</i>
- Earl's Court, in a flat she shares with...

30
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,840
- <i>Prostitutes and Australians.</i>
- What?

31
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,880
- Isn't that who lives in Earl's Court?
- In a flat she shares with friends.

32
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,320
Here's Diana! Diana, over here!

33
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,640
Any news, Lady Di?

34
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,800
Have you just been to Buckingham Palace?
Did you see the Prince of Wales?

35
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,440
From one woman to another,
is he a romantic at heart?

36
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,000
Lady Diana,
just one more question, please.

37
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,280
And?

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,680

49
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,800
Now what we have here
is a rather special box of chocolates.

50
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,000
Some are ours,
passed down through the family,

51
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,800
and some are for sale.

52
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,560
Anyway, the idea is that you pick one.

53
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,680
Any one?

54
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,960
- Hmm.
- Um…

55
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Oh…

56
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,320
Gosh.

57
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,920
Um…

58
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,800
This one's lovely.

59
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,000
- That's one of ours.
- Yes, ma'am.

60
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,320
From the Mogok Valley.

61
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,080
Any idea where that is?

62
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,800
Oh, I'm rather thick at geography.

63
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,920
Burma.

64
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,840
There's a legend, ma'am,

65
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,680
that long, long ago,

66
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,360
the northern part of Burma

67
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,960
was inhabited only by wild animals
and poisonous snakes. One day...

68
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,560
I think I prefer this one.

69
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,720
Yes, a lovely choice, ma'am.

70
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,240
That's one of yours. What can you tell us
about that, apart from the price?

71
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:36,560
It's a 12-carat
oval Ceylon sapphire, Your Majesty.

72
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,400
Surrounded by 14 diamonds.

73
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,120
Set in 18-karat white gold.

74
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,320
And you like that one because…

75
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,800
It's the most expensive?

76
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,880
No.

77
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,720
Because it reminds me
of my mother's engagement ring.

78
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,800
And… it's the same color as my eyes.

79
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,000
<i>- She is lovely.
- Yes.</i>

80
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,480
<i>But so young.</i>

81
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,560
<i>Yes.
Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother,</i>

82
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,680
suggested moving Lady Diana
into Buckingham Palace

83
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,080
<i>before</i> the announcement of the engagement
to protect her from the media.

84
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,440
Oh, that is sensible.

85
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,280
She also thought
some tutorials might be useful

86
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:17,200
for what will be a very drastic transition
from teenager to royal princess.

87
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,800
And…

88
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,440
Well, the feeling was,
if Your Majesty were agreeable…

89
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,680
- That I should be her teacher?
- Well, one queen to the next.

90
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,680
Mother-in-law, daughter-in-law,
might be nice.

91
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,360
Oh no, there's a lot to learn,
a lot to get right.

92
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,360
And you know me.
I'm far too much of a softy.

93
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,440
Mm.

94
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,760
Diana's grandmother,
Lady Fermoy, can do it.

95
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,840
Ma'am.

96
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,520
- Straight in at the deep end.
- Dinner with the family at Clarence House.

97
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,800
So fucking grand!

98
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,240
- So not Earl's Court.
- No.

99
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,360
A toast.

100
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,200
- To no more worries.
- No more flatmates.

101
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,920
No more rent collection or kindergarten.

102
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,840
No more cleaning your sister's flat.

103
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,440
Oh God!

104
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,000
Off to your palaces
and castles and frocks.

105
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,200
And jewels!

106
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,800
And to one day, not too far away,
being the fucking Queen.

107
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,920
Oh…

108
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,120
You will call, won't you? And write?

109
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,200
On Palace writing paper.
So that we can show everyone.

110
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,680
- I'll phone morning and night.
- No, you won't.

111
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,320
You'll be too busy trying on tiaras
and having tea brought to you.

112
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,560
Bye!

113
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,800
- Bye!
- Bye, Duch.

114
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,960
Bye, Princess.

115
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,840
- Diana!
- Diana!

116
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,600
Stop where you are, sir. Get back, please.

117
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,240
Get back.

118
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,160
Thank you.

119
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,920
<i>So there we are</i>

120
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,640
in Manila,
in the middle of a state banquet,

121
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,560
when who barges into the room?

122
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,600
None other than Imelda Marcos.

123
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,520
She makes a beeline straight for me,

124
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,760
saying she's desperate to show me her…
Wait for it…

125
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,640
- Shoe collection.
- Mm-mm.

126
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,920
<i>Shell</i> collection.

127
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,480
Are you sure?

128
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,240
She was probably trying to say "shoe,"
and you misunderstood her.

129
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,800
- Did she have something in her teeth?
- Shoe.

130
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,800
Shell.

131
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,000
No, I can assure you

132
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,560
it was "seashells."

133
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:16,880
So now the whole dinner party
decants into a convoy of limousines,

134
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,000
we're rushed through
the streets of Manila...

135
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,720
- Lady Diana Spencer, Your Majesty.
- I was speaking.

136
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,680
Uh…

137
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,880
- Oh dear.
- Sorry.

138
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,400
Your Majesty.

139
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,560
Um…

140
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,000
- Your Majesty.
- Hmm.

141
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,720
Your Royal Highness,
I didn't see you there.

142
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,080
Evidently not.
I was the one telling the story

143
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,960
you ruined with your entrance.

144
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,600
Sorry.

145
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,240
Uh-uh… This one next.

146
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,760
- Honestly.
- Sir.

147
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,240
"Your Royal Highness"
if it's the first greeting, then "sir."

148
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,360
Now me.

149
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,760
Ma'am.

150
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,160
You don't curtsy to her. She's not royal.

151
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,080
- Just grand.
- Poor Susan!

152
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,640
So sorry.

153
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,616
Thank goodness we've got
your grandmother to sort this out.

154
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,600
She's like
a regimental sergeant major.

155
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,120
- Aren't you?
- When required.

156
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,640
Urgently required,
I'd say, on tonight's showing.

157
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,680
- You'll iron all this out in no time.
- Ma'am.

158
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,280
Anyway, where was I?

159
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,960
Being rushed
through the streets of Manila.

160
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,680
Yes,
in Madam Marcos's private aquarium…

161
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,680
where she keeps
a vast portrait of herself…

162
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,800
wearing…

163
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,240
It is with the greatest pleasure…

164
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,520
that the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh

165
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,240
announce the betrothal
of their beloved son the Prince of Wales

166
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,920
to the Lady Diana Spencer…

167
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,480
daughter of the Earl Spencer

168
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,160
and the Honorable Mrs. Shand Kydd.

169
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,320
Hmm.

170
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,560
Well, many congratulations, sir.

171
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,040
I wonder if you both remember
when you first met.

172
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,960
It was a few years ago now.

173
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,040
I was visiting her sister,

174
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,280
and Diana was still quite young then.

175
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,680
And what was it about her
that made the biggest impression on you?

176
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,720
She was very original and lots of fun.

177
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,680
And for you?

178
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,440
Oh, he was simply marvelous.

179
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,480
What can you tell us
about the actual wedding?

180
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:04,440
We're not that far on yet,
but for now, we're delighted, really.

181
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,520
Mm-hmm.

182
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,360
I see you're going to bring
a deep and lasting joy to the nation.

183
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,800
And if I may say,

184
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,480
you both look very much in love.

185
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,600
Oh yes, absolutely.

186
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,000
Whatever "in love" means.

187
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,400
Where are you going?

188
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,120
Highgrove.

189
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,840
I have to go back to Gloucestershire

190
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,480
to pick up a few things
for this foreign tour.

191
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,640
Don't look like that.

192
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,120
Like what?

193
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,840
I'll see you at the airport tomorrow.

194
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,200
<i>Why are you so pleased?</i>

195
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,880
<i>'Cause I think
she's just the right person for him.</i>

196
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,440
<i>It's great, innit? It cheers everybody up…</i>

197
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,200
<i>Putting you through now, ma'am.</i>

198
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,440
- <i>Are you calling from the palace?
- </i>I am.

199
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,240
- <i>What's it like?</i>
- I have my own little apartment.

200
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,000
With a maid and a dresser.

201
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,640
- <i>Oh, you're a real princess!</i>
- And a sitting room.

202
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,800
<i>Does the phone
have a little crown on it?</i>

203
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,880
<i>Is the ring tone
"God Save the Queen"?</i>

204
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,600
- <i>Telly supper with the boss yet?
- </i>No.

205
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,520
Haven't spent any time with her yet,
even though we're in the same building.

206
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,400
<i>We saw one of your interviews.</i>

207
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,400
<i>- On television.
- Di, you looked great.</i>

208
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,800
<i>Di, they played it
on the six o'clock news.</i>

209
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,720
Did you hear how he answered
when they asked if we were in love?

210
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,440
- He said...
<i>- I know. We heard.</i>

211
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,000
<i>Don't worry.
He was probably just a bit embarrassed.</i>

212
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,840
Diana! Over here!

213
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,760
There she is!

214
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,320
Charles, over here!

215
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,640
I'm sorry.
This tour hasn't come at a good time.

216
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,960
Oh, I'll be fine.
Locked up in the palace on my own…

217
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,560
It's not for long.

218
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,680
Six weeks.

219
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,240
- Oh, it'll fly by.
- I doubt it.

220
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Kiss her!

221
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,040
Anyway, I'll see you at the altar.

222
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,400
I've asked Mrs. Parker Bowles
to get in touch with you.

223
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,640
Your ex? Why would you do that?

224
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,160
Because she's great fun.

225
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,560
I just thought if ever you wanted company,

226
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,400
she's the best company.

227
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,800
- Charles!
- Another kiss! Another one!

228
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,360
Big smile!

229
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,760
Goodbye.

230
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,280
Goodbye.

231
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,640
<i>I should warn you,
this won't be one session.</i>

232
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,200
<i>This won't be two sessions.</i>

233
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,000
What any new entry
into the royal family needs to learn

234
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,280
could barely be covered in 20 sessions,
but we <i>will </i>do it,

235
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,760
<i>and I will work you hard
because you cannot be allowed to fail.</i>

236
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,280
I propose we divide our lessons together
into three areas.

237
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,400
History. The history of the royal family,

238
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,960
the Court of St. James's,
the palaces and houses, and the household.

239
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,720
Deportment.

240
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,920
What to wear,

241
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,600
how and where to sit,

242
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:54,120
when to open your mouth
and, more importantly, what to say.

243
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,120
But based on the horrors
we saw the other night,

244
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,160
I think we need to start with
the all-important sink or swim rules,

245
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,440
rules which
if you get a single one of these wrong,

246
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,640
you're not just in trouble. You're dead.

247
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,640
- Right.
- Beginning with rank and precedence

248
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,120
and identifying which members
of the royal family you must curtsy to,

249
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,200
how, and in which order.

250
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,480
In your current position,
you curtsy to everyone,

251
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,600
but after you become Princess of Wales,

252
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,920
things get a little more complicated

253
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
because certain members of the family
will have to curtsy to you.

254
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,360
That in itself changes depending on
whether you're with the Prince of Wales…

255
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,840
Do you know, the one thing I really hate
is when I go to a restaurant

256
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,720
and the waiter comes to the table
and attempts to memorize the order

257
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,000
without writing it down.

258
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,000
You just know it's going to go wrong.

259
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,040
Right. When you are unaccompanied
as Princess of Wales…

261
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,080

263
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,120

Good morning, ma'am.

265
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,800
What's all this?

266
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,560
- It's your post, ma'am.
- Right.

267
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,520
<i>Dear Lady Diana, I don't suppose
you'll ever get to read this,</i>

268
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,800
<i>but I wanted to tell you
how much I enjoyed seeing the interview</i>

269
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,320
<i>you gave with the Prince of Wales
on television the other day. You looked…</i>

270
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,040
- <i>I knew then it must be love.</i>
- …<i>a young couple at the start…</i>

271
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,176
<i>…already has a poster of you
and Prince Charles on her bedroom wall…</i>

272
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,040
…<i>listening to this special day

273
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,160
<i>I will send you

274
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,880
<i>It's because you love people

275
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,640
<i>…you were
someone I could talk to…</i>

276
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,816
<i>…hairstyle,
how you have a smile for everyone.</i>

277
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,640
<i>Please can I be your flower girl?</i>

278
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,840
<i>Because I have never been one,
and my sister has.</i>

279
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,000
<i>Freya, age seven.</i>

280
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,480
Preparation. Arms. One, two.

281
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,560
Three, four. And one, two, three, four.

282
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,280
And point, point, point, and point.

283
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,200
Now finish.

284
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,040
Finish, and our arms come down.

285
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,960
And you present.

286
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,080
As you start low, the first one,

287
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,520
and then the next one higher,
then the next one higher, and then the…

288
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,520
<i>At primary schools
all over the land,</i>

289
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,000
<i>grateful teachers have seized upon
the wedding as their end-of-term project.</i>

290
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,240
<i>The key idea, to send a wedding card</i>

291
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,280
<i>from their class
to Prince Charles and Lady Diana.</i>

292
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,200
<i>This one was done
at a school in Southport,</i>

293
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,240
<i>and it was a pretty imaginative affair.
Everyone joined in,</i>

294
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,480
<i>but it was thought safer
to let the teacher address the envelope.</i>

295
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:18,760
<i>♪ And I sense a rhythm humming
In a frenzy all the way down her spine ♪</i>

296
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,480
<i>♪ Girls on film ♪</i>

297
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,040
<i>♪ Girls on film… ♪</i>

298
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,440
- Your Majesty.
- Good morning, Stephen.

299
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,520
Thank you, John.

300
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,240
There are three equerries to Her Majesty
within the palace,

301
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,960
one of them also performing the role
of Deputy Master of the Household.

302
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,560
In addition to the Queen's Page,

303
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,560
Her Majesty's
most senior personal servant,

304
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,880
there are also three categories of page.

305
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,280
Pages of the Chambers,
Pages of the Presence,

306
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,720
and Pages of the Back Stairs.

307
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,200
Now, shall we move on
to Ladies of the Bedchamber?

308
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,760
<i>If the weather's fine,</i>

309
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,480
<i>Prince Charles will make his way
to the altar and leave later</i>

310
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:49,400
<i>with Lady Diana in the 1902 State Landau.</i>

311
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,920
<i>It was first used by King Edward VII</i>

312
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
<i>and is now favored by the Queen
to meet foreign heads of state.</i>

313
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,440
<i>Its wet weather replacement
will be the Scottish State Coach…</i>

314
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,680
<i>Yes, ma'am?</i>

315
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,880
Could I speak to the Prince of Wales's
private secretary, please?

316
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,960
<i>One moment, please.</i>

317
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,200
<i>I'm afraid there's no answer, but I'll
certainly let Mr. Adeane know you called.</i>

318
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,720
Thank you.

319
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,920
<i>Yes, ma'am?</i>

320
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,080
I was wondering which number to call
to speak to the Queen.

321
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,360
<i>One moment, please.</i>

322
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,640
<i>Her Majesty is at a reception, ma'am,
but I shall inform her of your call.</i>

323
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,720
Thank you.

324
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,960
<i>Once upon a time…</i>

325
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,840
<i>not so long ago…</i>

326
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,080
<i>there was a little girl,
and her name was Emily.</i>

327
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,720
Morning, ma'am. More letters for you.

328
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,560
<i>And she had a shop.</i>

329
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,800
<i>There it is.</i>

330
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,760
<i>It was rather an unusual shop
because it didn't sell anything.</i>

331
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,640
<i>You see, everything in that shop window
was a thing that somebody had once lost.</i>

332
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,080
The Prince of Wales and I
are incredibly grateful

333
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,000
that you've all come out here
to join us this evening

334
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:35,560
in support of a cause
that's incredibly close to our hearts.

335
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,640
Protecting our local wildlife

336
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,960
is, um, crucial.

337
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,040
It is a…

338
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:45,600
You use your hands far too much.
You make gestures when you talk.

339
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,840
Gestures reveal us,

340
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,920
whether we're anxious or agitated
or cross. It's best not to give that away.

341
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,920
One should never try
to show one's emotions.

342
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:01,360
Now, Queen Mary famously taught
her ladies-in-waiting to use rope

343
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,960
to stop their arms flapping about
like windmills.

344
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,320
It's better.

345
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,320
Please carry on.

346
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,400
The Prince of Wales and I
are so incredibly grateful…

347
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,120
um, for all… to all of you
for coming here this evening

348
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,120
and showing your support
to a cause that is so…

349
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,360
um, incredibly close
to both of our hearts,

350
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,040
especially the Prince of Wales.

351
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,000
I haven't heard from him for three weeks.

352
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,360
<i>He must be busy.</i>

353
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,040
But not to ring a single time!

354
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,240
I asked to speak to the Queen,
but she won't see me either.

355
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,160
- <i>Has he sent flowers?</i>
- Nothing.

356
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,640
I get letters
from people all over the world,

357
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,800
but nothing, not a squeak,
from the man I'm supposed to marry.

358
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,760
How are you all?

359
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,520
<i>Good. Penny's taken your room.</i>

360
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,320
<i>Peter's over.</i>

361
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,040
<i>All the time.</i>

362
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,680
<i>Of course,
he's in love with Virginia!</i>

363
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,680
- <i>Stop!
- Oh, Duch, we miss you so much!</i>

364
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,880
- Ma'am.
- Over here!

365
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,960
- Lady Di!
- Over here, Lady Di!

366
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,000
- Just a picture, please.
- Di, just a quick snap!

367
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,920
- Don't you want a picture?
- Welcome to Ménage à Trois.

368
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,880
Here she is.

369
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,760
It was so kind of you to write.

370
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,040
Oh, not at all.
It's the very least I could do.

371
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,600
When the Prince of Wales told me

372
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,560
he was going away for six weeks
and not taking you…

373
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,320
May I?

374
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,480
Oh…

375
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,440
I said, "That's not very nice."

376
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,120
"Your poor brand-spanking-new,
gorgeous, young fiancée,

377
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,840
all alone in the house."

378
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,800
- Actually, left all alone in the palace.
- Yes.

379
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,000
Well, not the house.

380
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,800
That's what the Prince of Wales
calls Buckingham Palace.

381
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,880
It's what they all call it. "The house."

382
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,480
Mm.

383
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,520
Thank you.

384
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,920
The concept here is no main courses,

385
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,560
just starters and desserts.

386
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,080
No need to feel guilty about ordering pud
'cause it's all you're getting.

387
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:31,800
I'll have that delicious duck
and truffle ravioli thing I had last time,

388
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,880
then the orange and chocolate
creamy creation

389
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,040
that's stalked my dreams ever since.

390
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,320
I'll have the same.

391
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,040
Are you sure?

392
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,840
I'm very happy to go with the flow.

393
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,240
Well, he'll love that.

394
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,760
He's so fussy and set in his ways.
He'll love it if you adapt to him.

395
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,440
Trio of chocolate mousses
with vanilla cream and candied orange.

396
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,040
- Lovely!
- Thank you.

397
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,720
Thank you.

398
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,960
Mm! You know,
I took the Prince of Wales here once,

399
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:23,400
thinking he might like to try
something new. He loathed it.

400
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,080
- Oh?
- Loathed.

401
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,680
And not just the concept
or the décor or the people,

402
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,160
but… they made the cardinal mistake

403
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,480
of refusing to put a soft-boiled egg
on top.

404
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,600
What?

405
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,680
He has a soft-boiled egg with everything.

406
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,160
You must know that.

407
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,400
And he never eats garlic.

408
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:46,080
Because of this bizarre new rule,
come suppertime, he's always ravenous.

409
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,320
Which new rule?

410
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,520
The lunch rule.

411
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:58,000
I'd have thought it would've been one
of the first things you noticed about him.

412
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,760
The Prince of Wales doesn't eat lunch.

413
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,080
- What, never?
- Not if he can help it.

414
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,880
And if he's forced to
because of some engagement,

415
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:10,320
it puts him in a terrible mood,
and he drones on about gas and bloating,

416
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:14,000
and "wasted energy
due to needless digestion."

417
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,240
I try to cheer him up,
but when his tummy goes,

418
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,320
so does his sense of humor, I'm afraid.

419
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,720
One of his awful gurus put him onto it.

420
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,040
Well, not gurus, but you know
how he loves to surround himself

421
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,800
with dreary older men
and daddy substitutes.

422
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,600
No.

423
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,160
Darling, you really know nothing, do you?

424
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,160
You need a proper Fred tutorial.

425
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,320
No, thank you.

426
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,200
Who's Fred?

427
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,680
It's my nickname for the Prince of Wales.
And he calls me Gladys.

428
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,080
It's harmless nonsense, really.

429
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,360
Right.

430
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,840
Anyway,
one of his boring friends,

431
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,680
probably Laurens van der Post…

432
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,920
Good luck with that, by the way. Snooze.

433
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,760
…got into his head and said that it was
only healthy to eat two meals a day,

434
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,000
and since Fred says that breakfast
was too delicious to give up,

435
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,680
and dinner's too important,
it had to be lunch.

436
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,800
Now that you mention it,

437
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,320
we've hardly been with one another
at lunchtime,

438
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,640
so I haven't really noticed.

439
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,920
Fact is,
we've hardly been with one another at all.

440
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,040
That's not true.

441
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,120
It is.

442
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,240
- You met at Badminton Horse Trials.
- Yes.

443
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,720
Then Verdi's <i>Requiem </i>at the Albert Hall,
with a chaperone.

444
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,640
Granny, yes.

445
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,440
- Who didn't let you out of her sight.
- Not for a second.

446
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,840
Then the weekend at Balmoral,
where you were a complete triumph.

447
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,760
It'll go down in history
as one of the great Balmoral debuts,

448
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,160
the perfect ten. And then…

449
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,240
Highgrove?

450
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,080
Golly. He obviously tells you everything.

451
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,400
Well, we talk most days.

452
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,520
What did you think of it?

453
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,600
His new house.

454
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,720
- Highgrove?
- Mm.

455
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,160
It's, um… It's lovely.

456
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,880
- Isn't it?
- Mm.

457
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:31,120
He asked me what I would do with it
if I was decorating.

458
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,280
- Did he?
- Mm.

459
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,360
Yes. I'm rather good at all that.

460
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,560
And what did you say?

461
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:43,320
I said I'd like to zhuzh it up a bit.
Make it a bit less stuffy.

462
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:47,120
Give it a bit of color,
some yellows and peaches.

463
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,240
And don't forget green,

464
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,200
his favorite.

465
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,400
And green.

466
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,480
Do you garden?

467
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,080
- Not really.
- He's obsessed by gardening.

468
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,160
Yes, I know.

469
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:00,520
He's already talking about
either a wild garden or a walled garden.

470
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,600
Both.

471
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,560
- Both.
- Mm.

472
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,400
And a kitchen garden and a sundial garden.
Do you fish?

473
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,600
No, not really.

474
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,680
- What about hunting?
- Not if I can help it.

475
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,040
More of a townie, really.

476
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,720
So you see yourself living more in London
than in the country?

477
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,080
Why do you ask?

478
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,040
Just curious.

479
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,720
Mm.

480
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,960
Now I'm sorry, I can't stay for coffee.

481
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,040
Oh, then let me get this.

482
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,840
Absolutely not. I'm the senior party here.

483
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,920
Oh please.

484
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,200
Oh, let's go Dutch.

485
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,160
Good idea.

486
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,080
I'm all for sharing.

487
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:38,320
Lady Spencer is here to see you.
She asked if she could wait.

488
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,000
Thank you. Can I help you, ma'am?

489
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,760
I need to speak to the Prince of Wales
as soon as possible.

490
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,240
I'm afraid he's unavailable.

491
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,000
Is that what he asked you to tell me?

492
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,880
"If my future wife wants to speak to me,
make an excuse"?

493
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,640
No, His Royal Highness is unavailable

494
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,680
because he's on an aeroplane flying home.

495
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,800
- I thought he was flying back tomorrow.
- He was always flying back today.

496
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
What are these?

497
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,440
Those are drawings.

498
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,600
Of what?

499
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,880
I believe it's a bracelet
which the Prince of Wales has had made.

500
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,440
For who?

501
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,120
<i>Yes, ma'am?</i>

502
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,920
I need to speak to the Queen.
I need to speak to her.

503
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,640
<i>- Ma'am...</i>
- Don't fob me off.

504
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,520
It is absolutely essential
that I see the Queen.

505
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,600
This wedding can't go ahead.

506
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,560
It'll be a disaster for everyone.

507
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,720
<i>Her Majesty is unavailable, but I shall...</i>

508
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,320
Highgrove.

521
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,840
- Your Highness.
- Thank you very much.

522
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,240
- She's there.
- All right.

523
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,480
Everything all right in Gloucestershire?

524
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,480
Why do you ask?

525
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,120
There must have been
something very important

526
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,320
for you to go straight there
from the airport.

527
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,960
As it happens, there was.

528
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,200
Gladys.

529
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,640
She told you.

530
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,760
I saw the bracelet.

531
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,400
I had the bracelet made
as a farewell gift.

532
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,280
A… souvenir.

533
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,200
I went to Gloucestershire for two reasons.

534
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,200
To tell Camilla face-to-face
that it's over.

535
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Over.

536
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,240
And to collect this.

537
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,680
Open it.

538
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,600
A signet ring.

539
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,560
Prince of Wales insignia.

540
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,560
For the Princess of Wales.

541
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,400
Shall we begin the rehearsal?

542
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,400
Marriage is an honorable estate

543
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,640
instituted of God himself,

544
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:35,000
and therefore is not, by any,
to be enterprised,

545
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:38,960
nor taken in hand unadvisedly,
lightly, or wantonly,

546
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,560
but reverently, discreetly, soberly,

547
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,200
and in the fear of God.

548
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,240
Charles Philip Arthur George,

549
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,760
wilt thou have this woman
to thy wedded wife?

550
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,640
- Etcetera.
- Yes. Yes.

551
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,120
How were rehearsals?

552
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:33,040
Mummy and I thought lovely.

553
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:34,920
Margaret disagrees.

554
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:38,280
Charles loves someone else.

555
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:40,960
How many times

556
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:44,800
can this family make the same mistake?

557
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,640
Forbidding marriages…

558
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:50,840
that should be allowed.

559
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,520
Forcing others that shouldn't.

560
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,080
Paying the consequences each time.

561
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,120
He's marrying Diana.

562
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,680
But he's still in love with the other one.

563
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,720
Let me say something as a man.

564
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:13,480
The older Diana gets,

565
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:17,520
the more confident Diana becomes,

566
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:21,760
the more beautiful Diana becomes,
which she will…

567
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,480
the more
Charles will fall in love with her,

568
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,160
and this will all be fine.

569
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,280
In the meantime, he…

570
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,880
juggles them both?

571
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,360
That's how it works.

572
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,000
How it's always worked.

573
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,960
This is madness.
We can stop them now,

574
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,960
before they tie the knot.

575
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:49,440
Not just for the sake of the monarchy,
but for them as human beings.

576
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:57,160
We have to stop them <i>now.</i>

577
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:43,800
Mummy?

578
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:53,920
When your great-grandmother, Queen Mary,
was a beautiful young princess…

579
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,680
she was about to marry
her Prince Charming.

580
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:01,560
But before they got to the church,
he fell ill and died.

581
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,160
But everyone was so impressed with her,

582
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,680
that they put her together
with his younger brother.

583
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:09,880
Only one problem.
The younger brother was Prince Charmless.

584
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:12,920
Dull and shy.

585
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:16,400
There was no attraction,
certainly no love.

586
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,240
But in order to make the marriage work,
they were encouraged

587
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,480
to focus on the bigger idea.

588
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:24,560
Duty.

589
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,960
They worked and worked and worked.

590
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:34,080
And out of that work, a tiny seed grew.

591
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:36,600
A seed of respect and admiration,

592
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:40,040
a seed that grew into a flower
they could eventually call love.

593
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,160
They were married for 42 years.

594
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:54,040
They stabilized a country
that was at war with itself,

595
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,800
and they left the Crown stronger,

596
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,400
while all around them,
the great monarchies of Europe fell.

597
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,880
Now I cannot claim to be
the most intuitive mother,

598
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:12,200
but I do think I know
when one of my children is unhappy.

599
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:17,160
Whatever wretchedness you are feeling now…

600
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,240
whatever doubts you harbor…

601
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,920
if you could follow
the example of your great-grandmother…

602
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:32,720
love and happiness will surely follow.

603
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,240
<i>The question of the day,</i>

604
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:48,480
<i>apart from,
"What's the dress going to look like?"</i>

605
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,320
<i>is, "What's the weather going to be?"</i>

606
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,640
<i>Your most detailed forecast ever then,
Jack.</i>

607
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,800
<i>What's it gonna be like
from Buckingham Palace to St. Paul's?</i>

608
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:58,640
<i>This sunshine says it all, John,
really, doesn't it?</i>

609
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,640
<i>Well, the sun shining down
on a crowd that seems ready</i>

610
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:03,360
<i>to cheer almost anything that moves,</i>

611
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,320
<i>and it's a crowd that's getting bigger
and bigger by the minute</i>

612
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,360
<i>as the overnight trains and buses</i>

613
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:12,560
<i>bring thousands more people
to the palace from all over the nation.</i>

614
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,120
<i>Lots of people here
went to the fireworks display</i>

615
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,480
<i>last night in Hyde Park,</i>

616
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:19,080
<i>and then came straight down
to the palace afterwards</i>

617
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,040
<i>to make sure they get a good spot.</i>

618
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,200
<i>We're now getting closer to that point</i>

619
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,920
<i>when Prince Charles and then Lady Diana
set off for St. Paul's,</i>

620
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,680
<i>a scene that will be quite literally
flashed around the globe.</i>

621
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:33,480
<i>The King and Queen
of the Belgians, the King of Norway</i>

622
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,480
<i>with the Crown Prince and Crown Princess,</i>

623
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,320
<i>the Queen of Denmark,
the Prince of Denmark,</i>

624
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,696
<i>the King and Queen of Sweden,
the Queen of the Netherlands,</i>

625
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:42,640
<i>the Prince of the Netherlands, Grand-Duke
and Grand Duchess of Luxembourg,</i>

626
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:46,040
<i>the Prince and Princess of Liechtenstein,
and the Princess of Monaco.</i>

627
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:49,840
<i>The next time we see that coach,
we'll be peering inside these windows</i>

628
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,320
<i>to see if we can get some idea</i>

629
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,720
<i>of what the wedding dress
really looks like.</i>

630
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:09,600
Thank you.

631
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:30,960
<i>Here is the stuff
of which fairy tales are made.</i>

632
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:36,040
<i>The prince and princess
on their wedding day.</i>

633
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:41,320
<i>But fairy tales usually end at this point</i>

634
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:46,240
<i>with the simple phrase,
"They lived happily ever after."</i>

635
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:52,840
<i>This may be because fairy tales
regard marriage as an anticlimax</i>

636
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,200
<i>after the romance of courtship.</i>

637
00:52:56,200 --> 00:53:00,080
<i>As husband and wife live out their vows,</i>

638
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,600
<i>loving and cherishing one another,</i>

639
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:06,800
<i>sharing life's splendors and miseries,</i>

640
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:09,480
<i>achievements and setbacks,</i>

641
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:12,880
<i>they will be transformed in the process.</i>

642
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:19,360
<i>Our faith sees the wedding day
not as the place of arrival,</i>

643
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:24,640
