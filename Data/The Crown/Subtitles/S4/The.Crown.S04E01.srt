1
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,640
<i>Why are the English still with us?</i>

2
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,360
<i>Why, after everything
we've thrown at them,</i>

3
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,080
<i>does the British presence
in Ireland still endure?</i>

4
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,480
<i>So many sacrifices have been made.</i>

5
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,040
<i>So many of our brothers and sisters</i>

6
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,280
<i>have given their lives
in resistance to that occupation,</i>

7
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,040
<i>but we are still ignored.</i>

8
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,760
<i>We are still denied
our basic right to self-determination,</i>

9
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,240
<i>and our sons and brothers,
husbands and fathers</i>

10
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,520
<i>are still held in British jails.</i>

11
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,800
<i>Well, if nothing has changed,</i>

12
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,160
<i>then, my friends,
it is time for a new approach.</i>

13
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,080
Eyes right!

14
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,520
<i>That is why our leadership
has issued a new directive.</i>

15
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,040
<i>This is from the very top.</i>

16
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,520
<i>Today,
the Irish Republican struggle for freedom</i>

17
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,120
<i>enters a new phase.</i>

18
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,680
<i>The time has come to escalate our efforts…</i>

19
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,080
<i>- redouble our militancy…
- </i>Eyes right!

20
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,680
<i>…spill more blood,</i>

21
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,960
<i>so that the Crown retreats
and leaves Ireland forever.</i>

22
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,040
<i>No Charles?
He didn't stay for lunch?</i>

23
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,000
Couldn't wait to get away.
I heard he doesn't eat lunch anymore.

24
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,520
- Whyever not? How queer.
- Perhaps he wants to keep his figure.

25
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,080
How is he, Dickie?
He talks more to you than to anyone.

26
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,120
Well, I'm afraid it's now clear
the navy is not for him.

27
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,800
- I wasn't talking about his career.
- She means matters of the heart.

28
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,760
He comes to you with all of that.

29
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,360
We read about it
in the newspapers like everyone else.

30
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,200
This Westmorland girl
I've been reading about, in or out?

31
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,920
- No, she's out.
- Oh.

32
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,480
<i>There was a Guinness.</i>

33
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,840
<i>She's gone too.</i>

34
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,760
<i>And one in a bathing costume.</i>

35
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,136
<i>- Caroline Longman.
- With the whip?</i>

36
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,520
Not a whip. Whiplash.

37
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,520
- No, that was Anna Wallace.
- Heck of a horsewoman.

38
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,760
No, she broke it off with him.

39
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,640
And at one point, was there even a Borgia?

40
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,280
<i>Yes. Christabel.</i>

41
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,600
<i>Was she a serious contender,
with that name?</i>

42
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,280
<i>From what I gather, the latest is, um…</i>

43
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,000
<i>Sarah Spencer.</i>

44
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,080
Johnny's girl?

45
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,120
- His eldest, yes.
- Oh, I rather like that idea.

46
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,200
We all do. She's fun, she's clever…

47
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,160
And unlike
a certain Mrs. Parker Bowles,

48
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,480
she's not married.

49
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,640
He's not still seeing her, surely?

50
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,840
After all the lengths we went to.

51
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,360
Well, we can't be surprised.

52
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,880
He was following the advice he was given,
wasn't he, Dickie?

53
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,120
You were the one who encouraged it.

54
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,080
Telling him to sow his oats,
play the field?

55
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,600
No thought for his duty?

56
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,120
Well,
all the more reason to cheer for Sarah.

57
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,560
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

58
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,160
Your Royal Highness.

59
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,000
<i>I thought we'd ride out.</i>

60
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,160
There's a lovely lodge
the other side of High Wood we can go to

61
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,840
where we can be alone.

62
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,360
Your Royal Highness.
Ma'am, telephone for you. Mr. O'Keefe.

63
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,880
Oh. That's the estate office
with the key to the lodge.

64
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,280
- Can I leave you here for a minute, sir?
- Yes.

65
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,880
Sorry. I'm not here.

66
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,680
I was given strict instructions
to remain out of sight,

67
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,560
but I have to get to that room over there,
and this is the only way.

68
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,280
Your Royal Highness.

69
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,840
Well, I haven't seen a thing.

70
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,160
Thank you, sir.

71
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,200
It's quite a costume.

72
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,920
Is it a complete disaster?

73
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,320
We're doing
<i>A Midsummer Night's Dream </i>at school.

74
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,240
I love <i>Midsummer Night's Dream.</i>

75
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,120
So do I.

76
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,880
All the characters
have such wonderful names.

77
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,160
Flute, Snout, Goodfellow..

78
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,640
Snug, Quince…

79
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,160
Bottom!

80
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,680
Yes, Bottom.

81
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,520
They gave that part
to a girl called Francesca Lamont,

82
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,720
who also happens to have
the most enormous backside.

83
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,080
She took it personally.

84
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,160
She's had a bit of a nervous breakdown.

85
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,080
I'm Sarah's younger sister, by the way.

86
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,280
Please don't tell her you saw me.
I'll get into terrible trouble.

87
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,280
She wanted everything to be just perfect.
She wouldn't want me to scare you off.

88
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,360
How would you do that?

89
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,440
Well, you know…

90
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,640
by being a mad tree.

91
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,160
I won't say a thing.

92
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,240
Thank you, sir.

93
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,240
Keys. Got them.

94
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,000
Right. Ready?

95
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,080
Ready.

96
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,000
Is everything all right?

97
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,560
Yes. I just met your younger sister.

98
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,240
Did you?

99
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,120
That's sneaky of her.

100
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,640
- I told her to leave us alone.
- She was just passing through.

101
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,720
Well, she could have gone on the outside,

102
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,640
but she was obsessed
with the idea of meeting you.

103
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,080
- Was she?
- Obsessed.

104
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,120
<i>The last opinion poll,
published just over an hour ago,</i>

105
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,296
<i>gives the Tories a 16% lead…</i>

106
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,520
<i>…wonderful day. First of all for Britain…</i>

107
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,840
<i>…TUC concordat was now a dead document,
though that didn't mean…</i>

108
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,400
<i>It is her grit and remarkable stamina</i>

109
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,880
<i>that has kept her center stage
throughout this election.</i>

110
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,520
<i>Mrs</i>.<i> Thatcher believes…</i>

111
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,560
We are very... We are very confident.

112
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,360
<i>…a period
where people get hurt…</i>

113
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,760
<i>…woman with a mission.</i>

114
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,560
<i>She believes the people of Britain
will help to accomplish it.</i>

115
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,760
We are very confident.

116
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,960
<i>…or 21%…</i>

117
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:14,480
- Mrs. Thatcher, are you feeling confident?
- Are you gonna win today, Mrs. Thatcher?

118
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,080
I will not be drawn on any subject
save the weather.

119
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,800
<i>It's a lovely day.</i>

120
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,640
<i>It's looking like a comfortable
victory for the Conservative Party</i>

121
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,000
<i>and the prospect
of our first-ever woman prime minister.</i>

122
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,760
<i>- What do we know about Margaret Thatcher?</i>
- That's the last thing this country needs.

123
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,360
- What?
- Two women running the shop.

124
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,120
Perhaps that's precisely
what this country needs.

125
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,960
- I rather like what I've seen of her.
- What, the shopkeeper's daughter?

126
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,960
An alderman shopkeeper's daughter

127
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,600
who worked hard
and gained a scholarship to Oxford.

128
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,040
Yes, to study chemistry.

129
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,880
Yes, but later changed direction
and qualified as a barrister

130
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,840
while raising twins. You try doing that.

131
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,280
What about her character?

132
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,040
It says here,

133
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,800
"As a young woman, she applied for a job
as a food research chemist

134
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,800
and was rejected after
the personnel department assessed her

135
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,360
as being headstrong, obstinate,
and dangerously self-opinionated."

136
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,400
Really?
Who else around here does that sound like?

137
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,336
<i>You must be hopeful.
The polls show you comfortably ahead.</i>

138
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,480
<i>We never count our chickens
before they're hatched,</i>

139
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,560
<i>and we don't count
number 10 Downing Street</i>

140
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,240
<i>before it's Thatched.</i>

141
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,720
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

142
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,440
<i>Thank you.</i>

143
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,280
<i>What we're seeing now
is history in the making.</i>

144
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,880
<i>Britain's first woman prime minister,</i>

145
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,960
<i>a conviction politician
who's made no secret of the fact</i>

146
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,520
<i>she believes the country has to change
from top to bottom,</i>

147
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,600
<i>going to the palace,</i>

148
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,880
<i>presumably to tell her queen exactly that.</i>

149
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,600
Mr. and Mrs. Thatcher, follow me, please.

150
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,440
The leader
of the opposition, Your Majesty.

151
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,680
Mrs. Thatcher.

152
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,080
Your Majesty.

153
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,840
Your party has won the election.

154
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,680
It is my very great pleasure to invite you
to form a government in my name.

155
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,640
Congratulations, Prime Minister.

156
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,040
Thank you, ma'am.

157
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,160
Please.

158
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,640
Your family must be very proud.
You've two children?

159
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,840
Yes, but grown-up now
and out of the house.

160
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,120
And your husband is retired.
Is that right?

161
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,560
Yes, but he won't get in the way,

162
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,120
if that's what you're asking.

163
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,760
Denis is very good
at taking care of himself.

164
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,480
His golf clubs will be in the hallway.
He will come and go as he pleases.

165
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,280
He knows how busy I will be,
and how hard I intend to work.

166
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,440
To business then.

167
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,360
Have you decided on your first Cabinet?

168
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,480
I have.

169
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,920
It may surprise you

170
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
that I enjoy predicting
ministerial comings and goings.

171
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,000
It is like the races.

172
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,360
I like to study form and odds.

173
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,640
Who's in. Who's out.

174
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,440
I also like to predict cabinets.

175
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,560
My best so far
was Mr. Wilson's second reshuffle.

176
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,840
I got 90%.

177
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,480
Would you like to hear
my predictions for yours?

178
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,280
I'm assuming no women.

179
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,360
Women?

180
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,440
In cabinet.

181
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,480
Oh, certainly not.

182
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,040
Well, not just because
there aren't any suitable candidates,

183
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,360
but I have found women in general
tend not to be suited to high office.

184
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,680
Oh? Why's that?

185
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,680
Well, they become too emotional.

186
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,120
I doubt you'll have that trouble with me.

187
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,840
Mm. Now,

188
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,920
Willie Whitelaw. Home Office?

189
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,160
Yes.

190
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,240
Tick.

191
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,520
- Geoffrey Howe. Treasury?
- Yes.

192
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,080
Tick.

193
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,600
Hailsham. Lord chancellor?

194
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,120
Yes.

195
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,680
<i>Walker,
Heseltine, Biffen, Prior…</i>

196
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,240
She got most of them right.

197
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,600
She didn't guess St. John-Stevas
as minister for the arts,

198
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,400
but that's only because
she'd already correctly picked him

199
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,200
for the leader of the House.

200
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:52,560
- Smart cookie!
- Yes. Quite different to how I imagined.

201
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,600
More interested and informed.

202
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,120
With a commendable appetite for work,

203
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,520
which I'm told she keeps up
throughout the summer holidays.

204
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:11,000
I left thinking
we might work very well together.

205
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,440
Two menopausal women.
That'll be a smooth ride.

206
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,960
I heard that.

207
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,600
Oh.

208
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,760
- I don't mean to put extra stress on you.
- To be that tacky… It's disgusting.

209
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,000
It's certainly lovely
to be back. Thank you.

210
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,160
You going stalking with the boss?

211
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,680
She insisted.

212
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,760
Good.

213
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,280
Obviously, your life is your own business,

214
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,120
and your career as a show jumper
is your own business too,

215
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,440
but I heard you're thinking
of withdrawing from competition.

216
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,720
Is, uh… is that true?

217
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,000
Yes. I've had such a bad run recently.

218
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:18,120
With Badminton coming up
and a chance for Olympic competition?

219
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,920
I know, but Mark has decided
to compete himself this year

220
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,240
and that would mean us training together,
being on the circuit together.

221
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,400
I see.

222
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,920
Is that such a bad thing?

223
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,320
He is your husband.

224
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,840
Just about.

225
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,360
We were…

226
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:46,400
We were all so proud,
having an actual Olympian in the family.

227
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,520
An Olympian who's spent
much of the past year on her backside.

228
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,960
Oh, come on.

229
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,840
- This isn't like you.
- Hmm.

230
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,120
Remind me. What is "like me"?

231
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,760
I seem not to just have forgotten
how to ride, but who I am.

232
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,800
Well, then let me remind you.

233
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,160
You are the most…

234
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,840
brilliant…

235
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,560
resilient, most…

236
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,280
determined young woman that I know.

237
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,320
With a nasty dose of the horrors
when she sits on a horse.

238
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,800
They will go again…

239
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,320
with work, with determination…

240
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:39,720
and a Battenberg refusal to give in.

241
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,600
Hmm?

242
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,760
Thank you.

243
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,520
Ready?

244
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,200
- Good luck.
- Yes.

245
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,880
Won't be too hard to find
with the weather so still.

246
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,080
Yes, you're right. Good morning.

247
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,880
- Dry as well.
- Come on, girl.

248
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,840
Ready? Thank you.

249
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,520
Sir?

250
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,640
Telephone for you.

251
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,280
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Dear boy!

252
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
My office rang Buckingham Palace
what must be an hour ago,

253
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,920
and I've been put through
to about nine different extensions.

254
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,400
<i>Where have we reached you?</i>

255
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,160
Northeast Iceland,

256
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,960
in a lodge on the River Hofsá.

257
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,480
<i>What are you doing there?</i>

258
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,520
Salmon fishing with friends.

259
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,280
Are you at Classiebawn with the gang?

260
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,520
<i>The whole tribe,</i>

261
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,520
and everyone's asking after you.

262
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,240
Are you gonna be in London next week?
I'd like to see you.

263
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,800
I won't. I have a rendezvous with Camilla.

264
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,840
We've found a couple of days
where we could catch up.

265
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,400
Oh, Charles, you're not still seeing her?

266
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,960
<i>You know what the family thinks.</i>

267
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,760
Yes, I'm perfectly aware
of what the family thinks.

268
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,760
<i>And what I think too?</i>

269
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,160
Yes, and the richness of that
is not lost on me either.

270
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:25,040
That you, of all people, should lecture me
about the sanctity of marriage,

271
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,160
<i>affairs of the heart
needing to be conventional</i>,

272
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,560
because you and Edwina
hardly blazed a trail in that department.

273
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,120
At least
when Camilla and I commit adultery,

274
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,800
there aren't
national security implications involved.

275
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,040
That was uncalled for.

276
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,600
<i>So is your unwelcome intervention
in this matter.</i>

277
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,400
Honestly, you make a great show
of being my ally in this family,

278
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,480
watching my back,

279
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,800
but when the chips are down,
you're just a quisling.

280
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,440
<i>A fifth columnist
playing for the other side.</i>

281
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,000
The fact is, I haven't met anyone
I like as much as Camilla,

282
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,440
who is trapped in a marriage
of your engineering

283
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,160
<i>with a husband
who's bedding half of Gloucestershire.</i>

284
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,760
Invite us both to Broadlands soon.
You'll see how happy we make one another.

285
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,240
That is, if my happiness
is even remotely important to you.

286
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,120
Now I must go.

287
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,240
Come on, Daddy! Look at the time!

288
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,440
Nicholas! Timothy!

289
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:03,000
All right. Get this to the Prince of Wales
as soon as possible.

290
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,080
Sir.

291
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,280
Right.

292
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,400
Time to catch some lobster. Hmm?

293
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,960
Let's go.

294
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,080
Where did you see him?

295
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,160
Just up there, on the brow. Can you see?

296
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,280
Okay.

297
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,600
In case you're feeling a little chilled.
Here you are, Paul.

298
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,320
<i>Ahead!</i>

299
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,640
Ahead!

300
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,840
That's the one.

301
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,840
No. No, not like that.
You'll fall overboard.

302
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,400
Use the hook.

303
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,560
- Thank you, Grandpapa.
- There you go.

304
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,400
- Come on.
- There we are.

305
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,040
Need a bit more muscle.

306
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,800
Hold her behind the claws,
so they can't nip you. Ugh…

307
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,480
This is what we call a berried hen.

308
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,960
We're gonna throw this one back,
then she can have her babies in peace.

309
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,640
And one,

310
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,960
two, and…

311
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,160
Damn!

312
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,520
Stay on the radio!

313
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,360
Oh dear.

314
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,520
It's never good
when they come in packs like this.

315
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,960
Your Majesty.

316
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,800
We've received a copy of a telegram

317
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,080
<i>sent to the Foreign Office
from the British embassy</i>

318
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,720
<i>in Dublin.</i>

319
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,560
<i>It reads…</i>

320
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,160
<i>"At 13:05,
the British ambassador was informed</i>

321
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,240
<i>that there had been an explosion</i>

322
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,160
<i>on Lord Mountbatten's boat
in County Sligo."</i>

323
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,720
Lord Mountbatten is dead.

324
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:34,840
<i>As are the boat boy, Paul Maxwell,
and Lord Mountbatten's grandson Nicholas.</i>

325
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,640
<i>Lord and Lady Brabourne,
Doreen Lady Brabourne,</i>

326
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,280
<i>and Timothy Knatchbull
are in hospital</i>

327
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,920
<i>in Sligo.</i>

328
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,480
<i>The IRA has, I'm afraid,
already claimed responsibility.</i>

329
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,800
It's looking like the 5th, sir.

330
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,920
For the funeral.

331
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,800
At Westminster Abbey.

332
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,240
I was asked to give you this.

333
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,720
Thank you.

334
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,560
<i>My dear Charles,</i>

335
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,560
<i>there exists no greater compliment</i>

336
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,360
<i>than to be called a "prince among men."</i>

337
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,560
<i>Such a person earns his title</i>

338
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,360
<i>with his ability to lead and inspire…</i>

339
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:19,520
<i>elusive virtues,
to which you must reach and rise.</i>

340
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:24,400
<i>And it grieves me to say that
you are not working hard enough</i>

341
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,040
<i>to reach and to rise.</i>

342
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,400
<i>The choice of a woman was the issue</i>

343
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,320
<i>around which
the last Prince of Wales came to grief.</i>

344
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,720
<i>And it's astonishing to me that,</i>

345
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,440
<i>40 years after the abdication,</i>

346
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,560
<i>you are making so little attempt</i>

347
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:45,440
<i>to conceal your infatuation
for another man's wife.</i>

348
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:51,000
<i>How could you contemplate
such ruin and disappointment to yourself,</i>

349
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,800
<i>to your family,</i>

350
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,920
<i>to me?</i>

351
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,960
<i>Must I remind you again of the importance
of building your destiny</i>

352
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:04,480
<i>with some sweet and innocent,
well-tempered girl</i>

353
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,160
<i>with no past,</i>

354
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,480
<i>who knows the rules</i>

355
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,840
<i>and will follow the rules?</i>

356
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,320
<i>Someone with whom
you can make a fresh start</i>

357
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,080
<i>and build a new life.</i>

358
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,800
<i>One that people will love as a princess</i>

359
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,960
<i>and, in due course, as queen.</i>

360
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,760
<i>This is your duty now,</i>

361
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,320
<i>your most important task.</i>

362
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,880
<i>You are more than a man,</i>

363
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,960
<i>more than a prince,</i>

364
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,600
<i>and one day, dear boy, you shall be king.</i>

365
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,280
<i>But now, to the sea.</i>

366
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,400
<i>I miss you enormously.</i>

367
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,040
<i>There is no one
whose company I enjoy more.</i>

368
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,160
<i>But I think you know that.</i>

369
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,800
<i>Your ever-loving honorary grandpa…</i>

370
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,760
<i>Dickie.</i>

371
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,440
- Yes?
<i>- Buckingham Palace, Prime Minister.</i>

372
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,480
<i>Putting you through
to Her Majesty the Queen.</i>

373
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,760
- Your Majesty.
<i>- Prime Minister.</i>

374
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:36,120
<i>This is a very great tragedy.</i>

375
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,480
<i>Lord Mountbatten's death
leaves a gap that can never be filled.</i>

376
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:47,360
<i>Our heartfelt condolences
go out to you and your family,</i>

377
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,560
<i>and of course of those of the servicemen
killed at Warrenpoint today.</i>

378
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:57,920
I am sick and tired of those
who would seek to rationalize

379
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,600
and make excuses for the atrocities
committed by the IRA.

380
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,120
There's no such thing as political murder

381
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,880
or political bombing
or political violence.

382
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,520
There's only criminal murder,

383
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,760
criminal bombing, and criminal violence.

384
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,920
And I give you my word,

385
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,640
I will wage a war
against the Irish Republican Army

386
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:29,480
<i>with relentless determination
and without mercy</i>

387
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:32,480
<i>until that war is won.</i>

388
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,720
Oh, it's you.

389
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,040
Yes.

390
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,960
It's a terrible thing.

391
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,960
But…

392
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,360
he would have had no fear of death.

393
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,920
- None.
- No.

394
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,320
And he would have hated
any mawkish outpourings of grief.

395
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,360
Or sentimentality.

396
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,000
He left…

397
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,440
500 pages of instructions.

398
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,240
For the funeral.

399
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,960
And chose you

400
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,720
to do the reading.

401
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,280
You.

402
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,640
Architecturally, there is little
that is normal about this family.

403
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,000
Dickie's position within it
twisted it even further

404
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,800
out of shape.

405
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,120
I barely knew my own father.

406
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,840
Dickie understood that
and stepped in as a surrogate.

407
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,880
Which meant the world to me.

408
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,600
Then years later…

409
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,160
maybe when he saw the…

410
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,440
the struggles between the two of us…

411
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,640
he switched horses
and started caring for you.

412
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,280
I was no longer the priority.

413
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,040
He replaced me…

414
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,560
as father to you.

415
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
And you…

416
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,240
you replaced me as son to him.

417
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,160
I don't mind admitting
there were times where that…

418
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,440
transference of Dickie's affection,

419
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,560
of his care,

420
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,120
of his love…

421
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,600
it might have given rise in me
to a resentment.

422
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,680
Of me?

423
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,320
Not your fault, of course.

424
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,240
And…

425
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,200
When one was
as deprived of a father as I was,

426
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,840
one can't help feeling…

427
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,160
I don't know…

428
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,160
territorial of the next best thing…

429
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,000
which Dickie was.

430
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,880
To us both.

431
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,920
What are you talking about?

432
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,080
You have a father.

433
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,000
You have a father.

434
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,040
I'd be happy to stand aside, Papa, really.

435
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,160
Then you can do the reading.

436
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,040
It's irrelevant…

437
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,000
what I want or think.

438
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,760
It's what matters to Dickie.

439
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,200
And he chose you.

440
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,760
<i>This morning,
the Irish Republican Army</i>

441
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,120
<i>released a statement
taking full responsibility</i>

442
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,960
<i>for the execution of Lord Mountbatten</i>

443
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,760
<i>and for the deaths
of the 18 British servicemen</i>

444
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,120
<i>killed in our attacks at Warrenpoint.</i>

445
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,120
<i>"Thirteen gone and not forgotten.
We got 18 and Mountbatten."</i>

446
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,360
<i>To Irish Republicans,</i>

447
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:25,360
<i>Lord Mountbatten was the ultimate symbol
of imperialist oppression.</i>

448
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,720
<i>Each year, he came to sit in his castle</i>

449
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,440
<i>on land stolen by the English.
He knew the risks in coming here.</i>

450
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:37,520
<i>And his death represents a legitimate blow
against an enemy target.</i>

451
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,320
<i>Over the coming weeks and months,
you will all bear witness</i>

452
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,400
<i>to the cloying tributes
paid to this so-called hero.</i>

453
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,320
<i>But where are the tears
of the British government</i>

454
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,840
<i>for those men, women, and children
of Ireland who've lost their lives?</i>

455
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,840
<i>Where is their grand funeral</i>

456
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,440
<i>or solemn state occasion?</i>

457
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,600
<i>Who will eulogize their deaths</i>

458
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,160
<i>or pay tribute to the lives</i>

459
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,960
<i>of the many Irish citizens
so cruelly cut short,</i>

460
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:07,520
<i>like the 13 innocent civilians
murdered by the British on Bloody Sunday?</i>

461
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,320
<i>"Thirteen gone, not forgotten.
We got 18 and Mountbatten."</i>

462
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,600
"They that go down to the sea in ships…"

463
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,880
<i>This is war.</i>

464
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,000
"…and occupy…"

465
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,800
<i>There will be casualties.</i>

466
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,320
<i>But while
the British Crown remains in Ireland,</i>

467
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,120
<i>whatever blood is shed
will be on their hands.</i>

468
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,240
<i>"He maketh the storm to cease…</i>

469
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,120
so that the waves thereof…

470
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,400
are still."

471
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,240
"<i>Then are they glad…</i>

472
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,120
<i>because they are at rest.</i>"

473
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,320
<i>"And so he bringeth them unto the haven…</i>

474
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,760
<i>where they would be."</i>

475
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,640
Five minutes, Your Royal Highness.

476
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:33,080
<i>…this last stage
of the three-day event here at Badminton.</i>

477
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,480
<i>Lucinda Prior-Palmer,</i>

478
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,560
<i>well, she'll be looking to
break some records today</i>…

479
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,160
<i>…with a fourth win here
on yet another horse,</i>

480
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:45,440
Killaire,
on whom she finished third two years ago.

481
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,760
She'll be jumping last.

482
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,800
<i>But next into the arena</i>

483
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:53,160
<i>is Her Royal Highness Princess Anne
riding Goodwill.</i>

484
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,000
- Timekeeper ready?
- Ready.

485
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:59,720
<i>After an average
dressage test and run out,</i>

486
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,760
<i>the princess will need to jump clear…</i>

487
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,121
- Here she comes. Come on!
- Ah, yes.

488
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,280
<i>…inside time in order to qualify.</i>

489
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,520
- Good luck.
- Ready?

490
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:08,440
I am.

491
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:12,960
<i>Her Royal Highness coming back
from some career difficulties last year.</i>

492
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:18,320
<i>Just looking a little sticky
coming up to this first fence here.</i>

493
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,680
These fences,
a maximum height of 3 ft. 11 in.

494
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,640
Go on! Lovely.

495
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,960
- Well done, keep it together.
- Steady.

496
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,240
That's it. Yes.

497
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,400
<i>Clears that one nicely,
then a tight turn…</i>

498
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,560
Well done.

499
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,280
<i>…coming into the next fence.</i>

500
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,480
<i>Coming up nicely.</i>

501
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,160
- Come on!
- Don't shout.

502
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,560
<i>- Takes it well.</i>
- Clear.

503
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,040
Fifteen seconds gone.

504
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,640
<i>Oh.</i>

505
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,200
- Clear.
- Wow!

506
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,520
<i>- Almost four faults there.</i>
- Lovely.

507
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,520
<i>The princess so nearly coming unstuck,</i>

508
00:43:55,600 --> 00:44:00,200
<i>but it holds up, as she heads towards
the final combination.</i>

509
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:03,960
<i>This is a big double,
and she seems to be coming in short.</i>

510
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,040
<i>- No, she's done it!</i>
- Yes! Come on.

511
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:09,640
- How are we doing?
- She needs to pick it up.

512
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,600
Nearly there. Come on, Anne.

513
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:15,160
<i>As she heads towards the final fence…</i>

514
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,640
- Yes!
- Oh!

515
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,640
<i>She's done it, Princess Anne.</i>

516
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,200
<i>Those four inside time.</i>

517
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,480
<i>That is a fantastic effort…</i>

518
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,360
- Brilliant!
- …<i>from Her Royal Highness,</i>

519
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:32,800
<i>who finishes overall in sixth place,
and that should be enough.</i>

520
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:33,720
Wonderful.

521
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,240
- We must congratulate her.
- You go.

522
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,360
- You missed it.
- No, I saw the last bit.

523
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,920
- Mummy.
- What are you doing here?

524
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:47,720
I thought an extra pair of lungs
to cheer Anne on couldn't hurt.

525
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,360
Except I doubt she'd have heard.

526
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,800
- Your father was making such a noise.
- Was he?

527
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,200
Beside himself.

528
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,720
I'm so happy Anne can give him that.

529
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,640
It's really
the best possible tonic for him.

530
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,200
- We could all do with cheering up.
- Yes.

531
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,120
All one can think of is Dickie.

532
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,720
That's it. Follow the road round.

533
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,680
Here on the left, sir.
Thanks very much, sir.

534
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,440
Your Royal Highness.

535
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,760
I just wanted to offer my condolences.

536
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,640
It must have been
completely devastating for you.

537
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:37,520
And your reading at the Abbey,

538
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,880
how you held it all together
under the circs,

539
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:42,080
I don't know how you did that.

540
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,880
- It was utterly brilliant.
- Thank you.

541
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,960
I'm sorry. We haven't met.

542
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,040
We have.

543
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,640
I was in costume at the time.

544
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,240
Sarah Spencer's younger sister.

545
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,120
Oh. The mad tree!

546
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,280
Diana.

547
00:45:58,360 --> 00:45:59,760
Yes. Yes.

548
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:05,360
Sarah told me how close you were
to Lord Mountbatten,

549
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,040
that he was like a father to you.

550
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:11,600
Yes.

551
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,040
It must all be unimaginably awful.

552
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:16,760
Thank you.

553
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,440
It has been.

554
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,160
Come on!

555
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:34,000
I just wanted to say
you're very much in my thoughts.

556
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,200
All our thoughts.

557
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:39,440
Sir.

558
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,720
Oh, come on!

559
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:35,240
- Hello?
- Sarah.

560
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,440
Your Royal Highness!
That's a nice surprise.

561
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:43,800
First things first. I'm afraid
I won't be able to come to your wedding.

562
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,600
But congratulations to you and, uh…

563
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,400
Neil.

564
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,040
- Thank you, sir.
<i>- Now…</i>

565
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:54,760
your sister, Diana…

566
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:55,880
Yes?

567
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:59,080
<i>- Tell me about her.</i>
- What would you like to know?

568
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:00,240
<i>Everything.</i>

569
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,440
<i>I'm not sure
you want to know everything.</i>

570
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,000
Maybe I do.

571
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:10,920
All right.
She works part-time at a kindergarten.

572
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,280
<i>- She's a teacher?
- No.</i>

573
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:14,560
<i>For that,
you'd need actual qualifications.</i>

574
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,200
<i>More of a helper-out.</i>

575
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,000
<i>She's only just turned 18, you know.</i>

576
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,840
She also cleans for me.

577
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,720
<i>- Part-time.</i>
- As in…

578
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,160
<i>Like a cleaning lady.</i>

579
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:29,520
You want more?

580
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:32,120
A little more.

581
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:33,640
<i>Is she fun?</i>

582
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:35,880
She can be great fun.

583
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:38,241
<i>And I'm sure all the kids love her.</i>

584
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,720
I'm sure all the kids' dads love her too.

585
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:42,560
Really?

586
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,840
What about her… character?

587
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:50,360
<i>Everyone in the family calls her
"Duch," because ever since childhood,</i>

588
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:54,120
she's behaved as if
she were destined for greater things.

589
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,200
Oh dear. Have I just put you off?

590
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:00,800
No.

591
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:03,960
You've rather intrigued me now.

592
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:08,160
Would you mind if I asked her out?

593
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,280
- <i>Out </i>out?
<i>- Yes.</i>

594
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:12,760
Gosh.

595
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,480
<i>- Would you mind?</i>
- No.

596
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:17,760
Should I warn her?

597
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,280
No.

598
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,040
Let it be a surprise.

599
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:25,040
I might need her telephone number first.

600
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,200
Of course. It's…

601
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:29,200
It's…

602
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,760
<i>01373…</i>

603
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,280
- Di?
- Di?

604
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:39,360
Diana?

605
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,120
It's the Prince of Wales.

606
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,200
Hello?

607
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:53,400
Your Royal Highness.
