1
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,720
<i>…of his party.</i>

2
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,920
<i>Mr. Heseltine says Britain
should reach for the levers of power</i>

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,280
<i>if only to prevent
others pulling them first.</i>

4
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,680
<i>One dead in an Ulster gun battle
between soldiers and terrorists.</i>

5
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,480
<i>Police make arrests over ballot rigging
in the transport union.</i>

6
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,160
<i>Confusion over plastic clingfilm…</i>

7
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,120
Thank you, dear.

8
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,960
<i>…government's cancer warning.
And animals to the slaughter.</i>

9
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,760
<i>How the RSPCA hopes
to stop live animal exports.</i>

10
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,880
<i>Michael Heseltine was speaking
to a conference in Hamburg.</i>

11
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,680
<i>Mr. Heseltine is now
on his way back to London</i>

12
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,480
<i>to be in the Commons this afternoon.</i>

13
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,640
<i>There, Sir Geoffrey Howe
is expected to spell out in detail</i>

14
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,600
<i>the reasons for his resignation.</i>

15
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,120
<i>Is there anything
Sir Geoffrey is likely to say</i>

16
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,640
<i>that could influence Mr. Heseltine
on whether to throw his hat in the ring?</i>

17
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,320
<i>Well,
Sir Geoffrey is an extremely cautious man.</i>

18
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,760
<i>I suspect
that his speech will be carefully written,</i>

19
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,080
<i>and I just wonder
whether it will be sufficiently in code</i>

20
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,320
<i>not really to damage the prime minister.</i>

21
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,560
<i>Sir Geoffrey has very deep personal
and ideological differences</i>

22
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,160
<i>with the prime minister.
I think he will spell them out,</i>

23
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,360
<i>but whether he will spell them out
in clear, set terms</i>

24
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,520
<i>that amount to an assault
on her leadership,</i>

25
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,480
<i>I think we have to wait and see for that.</i>

26
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,200
<i>I remind the House
that a resignation statement</i>

27
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,680
<i>is heard in silence
and without interruption.</i>

28
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,640
Sir Geoffrey Howe.

29
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,040
Hear, hear.

30
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,200
Mr. Speaker, sir,

31
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:27,040
"I find, to my astonishment,
that a quarter of a century has passed

32
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,960
since I last spoke
from one of these backbenches."

33
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,240
"Mr. Speaker, I believe
that both the chancellor and the governor

34
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,200
are cricketing enthusiasts."

35
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,680
"So I hope that there is
no monopoly of cricketing metaphors."

36
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,800
"Increasingly,
those of us close to the prime minister

37
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,400
feel like opening batsmen
being sent to the crease,

38
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,120
only to find
the moment the first balls are bowled

39
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,600
that our bats have been broken
before the game by the team captain."

40
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,880
Order!

41
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,840
Order.

42
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,960
"The point… The point, Mr. Speaker,

43
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,120
was perhaps more sharply put
by a British businessman,

44
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,760
trading in Brussels and elsewhere,
who wrote to me last week."

45
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,120
'People throughout Europe, ' he said,

46
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,040
'see our prime minister's finger-wagging

47
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,320
and hear her passionate 'No, no, no'

48
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,560
much more clearly than the content
of the carefully worded formal texts.'"

49
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,840
"'It is too easy, ' he went on,

50
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,920
'for them to believe
that we all share her attitudes.'"

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,760
"'For why else, ' he asked,

52
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,080
'has she been our prime minister
for so long?'"

53
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,160
"'This is, '
my correspondent concluded,

54
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,360
'a desperately serious situation
for our country.'"

55
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,200
And sadly, Mr. Speaker, I have to agree.

56
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,000
"The conflict of loyalty,

57
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,960
of loyalty to my right honorable friend
the prime minister,

58
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,480
and, after all, in two decades together,

59
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,600
that instinct of loyalty
is still very real…

60
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,360
and of loyalty to what I perceive to be
the true interests of the nation,

61
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,680
that conflict of loyalty
has become all too great."

62
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,360
"I no longer believe it possible

63
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,480
to resolve that conflict
from within this government."

64
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,320
"That is why I have resigned."

65
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,560
"In doing so,
I have done what I believe to be right

66
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,840
for my party and my country."

67
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,320
"The time has come for others
to consider their own response

68
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,560
to the tragic conflict of loyalties

69
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,960
with which I have myself wrestled…
for perhaps too long."

70
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,880
Hear, hear.

71
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,760
Lilibet?

72
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,520
- Uh, the Queen?
- In the drawing room, Your Royal Highness.

73
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,600
Right.

74
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,640
She has resumed
her affair with Major Hewitt

75
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,160
with flagrant disregard for the agreement
we made in our meeting with you.

76
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,800
A meeting in which it is now clear
she brazenly lied to your face.

77
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,480
So I hope you agree

78
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,120
it leaves me no option
but to start a formal separation.

79
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,200
Oh, Charles!

80
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,576
I'm wretchedly unhappy,
yet there is someone else out there

81
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,280
who would make me perfectly happy.

82
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,160
- Quick, switch on the television.
- Why?

83
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,240
It's the Ides of March.

84
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,080
It's Julius Caesar,
or should I say <i>Julia </i>Caesar?

85
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,360
We're in the middle
of an important conversation.

86
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,040
- Shh.
<i>- …her style of government.</i>

87
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,840
<i>He says her nightmare image of Europe
risks the future of the nation.</i>

88
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,720
<i>Can Sir Geoffrey's peroration,</i>

89
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,160
<i>where he said the time has come
for others to consider their response,</i>

90
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,160
<i>be read in any other way
than a clear invitation to open a contest</i>

91
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,120
<i>for the leadership?</i>

92
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,440
<i>That is one of the implications.
Some people would go further than that.</i>

93
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,480
<i>They would say he is urging people
to vote against Mrs. Thatcher…</i>

94
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,600
<i>…Thatcher is facing
the most serious threat</i>

95
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,800
<i>to her 11 years in power…</i>

96
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,160
<i>…first time in 15 years…</i>

97
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,880
<i>Geoffrey Howe,
Mrs. Thatcher's longest-serving colleague</i>

98
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,520
<i>throughout her years in power,
turned on her in the Commons today</i>

99
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,440
<i>and accused her
of risking the nation's future.</i>

100
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,760
<i>He was explaining for the first time</i>

101
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,840
<i>why he resigned as deputy prime minister
12 days ago.</i>

102
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,320
<i>…refusal to keep in step
with the European community.</i>

103
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,120
<i>…a coded diplomatic speech.</i>

104
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,720
<i>Instead,
years of resentment and frustration</i>

105
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,640
<i>were compressed
into a bitter attack on Mrs. Thatcher</i>

106
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,400
<i>and her attitude to Europe.</i>

107
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,120
<i>He called on Conservative MPs</i>

108
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,360
<i>to consider what he described
as their conflict of loyalties…</i>

109
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,400
<i>Howe delivered
a stinging indictment…</i>

110
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,200
<i>There is great bitterness
on the prime minister's side,</i>

111
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,080
<i>and they hope there will be some reaction
in her favor. It's down to Conservative…</i>

112
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,480
<i>Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
faces a challenge</i>

113
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,040
<i>that could cost her her job.</i>

114
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,320
<i>…MPs, ministers, and peers
are still trying to assess</i>

115
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,280
<i>what one described
as an incitement to mutiny</i>

116
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,000
<i>and another said was an act of treachery.</i>

117
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,760
William!

118
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,760
Run!

119
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,800
Oh, Ivo's got it! Ivo's got it!

120
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,560
Go, Ivo! Go, Ivo!

121
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,640
- Ivo!
- Move it!

122
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,960
Yes, well done!

123
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,040
Yes, well done!

124
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,880
Well done, Ivo!

125
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,240
Oh, he's brilliant, isn't he? Yes!

126
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,120
Did you see that? Yes!

127
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,600
Well done, boys!

128
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,800
Bye, my darling.
Not long until the holidays.

129
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,880
Hmm?

130
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,760
Love you.

131
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,960
- Well done today.
- Thank you.

132
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,480
And we'll see you at Christmas.

133
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,480
Goodbye.

134
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,920
Take care.

135
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,120
Is that it?

136
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,760
We're not going to talk again, ever?

137
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,440
Since every time we do talk,
it ends in an argument,

138
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,520
I'd say silence was preferable.

139
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,000
What's this I hear
about a trip to New York?

140
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,960
Oh, don't look so surprised.

141
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,480
The government requested it.
Everyone knows I'm going.

142
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,440
No one knew you were going on your own.

143
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,280
What an ugly, avaricious piece
of self-advancement that is.

144
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,240
I'd sooner be doing it
with my husband by my side.

145
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,960
Doing what?

146
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,800
The past few months, you've barely been
in a fit state psychologically

147
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,440
to go to the hairdresser,
much less represent the Crown.

148
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,720
Although I gather you still found time
to see… certain other people.

149
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,720
I think
this conversation's gone as far as it can.

150
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,240
You were the one who insisted on talking.

151
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,440
I always said silence was preferable.

152
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,640
- Mrs. Thatcher?
- Prime Minister?

153
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,960
<i>One crisis rising above
all the others today, Your Majesty.</i>

154
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,880
Yes.

155
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,240
An inconvenience
one would dearly like to avoid,

156
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,080
given the significant challenges
this country already faces.

157
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,040
The crisis in the Gulf.

158
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,360
Oh, <i>that </i>crisis?

159
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,280
Well, that is
the predominant challenge facing us.

160
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,360
I thought you might be
referring to matters closer to home.

161
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,080
There are one or two
minor domestic matters,

162
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,520
some changes
to the fishing license conditions,

163
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,400
but nothing I would want
to waste your valuable time with.

164
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,960
You don't think
we should briefly discuss… that speech?

165
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,440
Which speech?

166
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,880
The resignation speech
made by Sir Geoffrey Howe

167
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,280
that's caused such a stir.

168
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,360
Why would we want to discuss that?

169
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,960
Because a great deal of fuss
is being made of it.

170
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,320
Oh, poor Geoffrey.

171
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,400
I'd offered him
the position of deputy prime minister,

172
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,720
and he seems to have taken it
rather the wrong way.

173
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,560
In the newspapers, his speech is seen
as a direct challenge to your authority.

174
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,560
I think that all depends
on which newspapers you're reading.

175
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,880
Not just newspapers. Television too.

176
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,960
Or watching.

177
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,600
And as sovereign, I must ask you…

178
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,400
do you expect a leadership challenge?

179
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,160
- The prime minister came to see me today.
- Ah, yes.

180
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,560
To discuss
the crisis in the Gulf.

181
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,640
What?

182
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,920
Not the fact
that she'd just been knifed in the back

183
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,840
by one of her longest-standing allies?

184
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,360
No, I asked her about that.

185
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,480
- Did you really?
- Yes.

186
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,360
You're brave.

187
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,720
What did she say?

188
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,760
She said the situation was unfortunate…

189
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:56,240
…but it amounts to little more
than petty rivalries and resentments…

190
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,936
…played out
at the level of the schoolyard.

191
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,840
I shall see them off in no time.

192
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,680
And, really,
we should not dignify an insignificant…

193
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,000
…internal party squabble
with any more of our precious time.

194
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,880
Well…

195
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,600
<i>Sir Geoffrey's attack makes this,
the criticism of Mrs. Thatcher,</i>

196
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,200
<i>much more lethal.</i>

197
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,120
<i>I think she's in deep trouble,</i>

198
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,280
<i>not that she will be beaten
in the first ballot by Michael Heseltine,</i>

199
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,480
<i>but more probably that
there will be enough votes against her</i>

200
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,080
<i>and enough abstentions
to damage her seriously.</i>

201
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,040
<i>One person said to me
that he thought it possible,</i>

202
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,640
<i>if she were badly enough damaged,</i>

203
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,440
<i>that members of the Cabinet
would go to the chief whip</i>

204
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,840
<i>and say that
she ought to consider her future.</i>

205
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,920
<i>It's premature to say that yet,</i>

206
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,920
<i>but undoubtedly
there's a rather stronger tide</i>

207
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,600
<i>running against Mrs. Thatcher tonight
than there has ever been before.</i>

208
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,080
Powell.

209
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,840
Yes.

210
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,560
Yeah.

211
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,240
I see.

212
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,080
Thank you.

213
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,880
How many?

214
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,000
- We're four short.
- Oh.

215
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,400
Not enough to stop it
going to a second ballot.

216
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,960
Oh, it's betrayal of the very worst kind.

217
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,480
They owe their political lives to me.

218
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,120
- It's despicable.
- Oh, those little men!

219
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,960
And you want me
to get on my knees to them?

220
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,600
Never.

221
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,200
Have them brought in to me.

222
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,480
One by one.

223
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,240
First item on the agenda
is Her Royal Highness's forthcoming…

224
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,200
<i>solo </i>visit to New York.

225
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,440
Looking at the itinerary,

226
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,560
our concern would be
that it seems to be challenging.

227
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,760
Several appointments each day.

228
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,520
- It's just four days, Edward.
- In multiple locations.

229
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,200
We all know the toll
a schedule of engagements can take,

230
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:41,160
and I'm sure no one here would wish to see
the Princess of Wales overstretched.

231
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,920
Certainly not at a risk to her own health.

232
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,520
The Princess of Wales's health
is exemplary.

233
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,960
Mental health.

234
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,600
Not to mention the amount of time
she'd be separated from her children

235
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,160
and the distress that might cause her.

236
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,800
The Princess of Wales
is well aware of what's required of her

237
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,360
and is very much
looking forward to the trip.

238
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,560
I have only one question.

239
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,760
Will you support me?

240
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,760
Of course.

241
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,120
You will always have
my unconditional support.

242
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,440
I am with you.

243
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,760
You can always count on me.

244
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,280
The problem is…

245
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,600
…the numbers are against you…

246
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,920
…and your inability
to unite the party behind you…

247
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,880
…over Europe…

248
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,040
…over the economy…

249
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,000
…over taxation…

250
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,120
Perhaps if your methods
were less confrontational…

251
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,800
…and if you'd consulted with Cabinet
rather than ruling by decree…

252
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,280
…your rejection
of core Conservative values,

253
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,480
of moderation…

254
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,640
…compassion…

255
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,040
…and your total disregard
for the center ground…

256
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,600
…leaves you vulnerable.

257
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,240
Exposed. Isolated.

258
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,680
I shall always defend you, Margaret.

259
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,320
<i>Always.</i>

260
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,000
But…

261
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,320
…as your friend…

262
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,400
…as an ally…

263
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,760
…I think I speak for the majority
when I say…

264
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,480
…the time might have come
for some new blood.

265
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,320
<i>…and that it would be
in everyone's best interests</i>

266
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,360
<i>if you were to… stand down.</i>

267
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,160
Bastards.

268
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,120
The bloody lot of them.

269
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,360
Murderers.

270
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,120
So…

271
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,240
…is that it?

272
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,640
Is that the end?

273
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,040
No.

274
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,760
I still have one card to play.

275
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,320
<i>Britain will send more troops to the Gulf.</i>

276
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,760
<i>The defence secretary Tom King
has said Britain…</i>

277
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,480
<i>President Bush called
to tell me he thought it barbaric.</i>

278
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,280
<i>Chancellor Kohl said it was inhumane.</i>

279
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,240
<i>Mikhail Gorbachev reminded me
that ten years ago,</i>

280
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,920
<i>it was Britain
holding democratic elections</i>

281
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,280
<i>whilst Russia staged cabinet coups.</i>

282
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,040
<i>Now it's the other way round.</i>

283
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,600
What they all agree on

284
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:48,960
is that getting rid of me
is an act of national self-harm,

285
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,120
which is why I've come to you, ma'am,

286
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,880
that together we may act
in the national self-interest.

287
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,000
How might I help?

288
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,960
By dissolving Parliament.

289
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,800
What?

290
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,960
We are on the brink of war.

291
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,280
What kind of signal
does that give to our enemies,

292
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,600
to Saddam,

293
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,720
if we were to change leadership now?

294
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,120
It would make us look
hopelessly weak and divided.

295
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,800
I agree it's not ideal.

296
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,600
Have you consulted Cabinet on this matter?

297
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,560
I have not, ma'am.

298
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,160
Surely that would be
the normal course of action?

299
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,200
With all due respect,

300
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,200
the decision to dissolve Parliament

301
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,600
is in the gift
of the prime minister alone.

302
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,320
It is entirely within my power
to do this if I see fit.

303
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,480
You are correct.

304
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,520
Technically,
it is within your power to request this.

305
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,240
But we must all ask ourselves

306
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,080
when to exercise those things
that are within our power and when not to.

307
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,680
Your first instinct as a person,
I think, is often to act.

308
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,880
To exercise power.

309
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,240
Well,
that is what people want in a leader.

310
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,240
To show conviction and strength.

311
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,600
To <i>lead.</i>

312
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,640
I'm merely asking the question.

313
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,720
Whether it is correct to exercise a power
simply because it is yours to use.

314
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,960
Power is nothing without authority.

315
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,200
And at this moment,

316
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,960
your Cabinet is against you.

317
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,480
Your party is against you.

318
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,640
And if the polls are to be believed,

319
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,800
if you were
to call a general election today,

320
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,000
you would not win.

321
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,320
Which suggests the country is against you.

322
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,000
Perhaps the time has come

323
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,960
for you to try doing nothing for once.

324
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,280
The difference is…

325
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,320
you have power…

326
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,520
in doing nothing.

327
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,080
I…

328
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,320
will have nothing.

329
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,720
You will have your dignity.

330
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,400
There is no dignity in the wilderness.

331
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,720
Then might I suggest
you don't think of it as that.

332
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,160
Think of it as an opportunity
to pursue other passions.

333
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,240
I have other loves.

334
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,440
My husband, my children…

335
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,640
But this job <i>is </i>my only true passion.

336
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,720
And to have it taken from me…

337
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,000
stolen from me so cruelly…

338
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,480
What hurts the most

339
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,320
is that we had come so far.

340
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:46,240
And now to have
the opportunity to finish the job

341
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,520
snatched away at the very last…

342
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,240
<i>I'm in hell!</i>

343
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,160
And he just hates me.

344
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,720
And wants me to fail.

345
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,560
He tells everyone I'm mad.

346
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,080
They treat me like I'm mad.

347
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,720
And I'm starting to <i>feel </i>mad.

348
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,480
Why did I agree to this trip?

349
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,280
<i>I'm going to fall flat on my face.</i>

350
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,120
All right?

351
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,480
I think so.

352
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,360
Lovely to meet you. Hello.

353
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,680
Lovely to meet you.

354
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,840
Princess Diana, one quick…

355
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,560
Over here, please, Lady Di!

356
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,760
I love you, Diana!

357
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,360
Diana! Diana!

358
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,360
Thank you so much.
That's so kind. Thank you.

359
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,720
- Your Royal Highness.
- Hello.

360
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,040
We're so thrilled to have you with us.

361
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,160
This is Linda Correa.

362
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,440
Lovely to meet you, miss.

363
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,960
They told us there was a waiting list
for public housing…

364
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,560
A modest hospital
on the wrong side of Harlem

365
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,720
very few American politicians
have ever even thought to visit,

366
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,560
but today this is the final stop

367
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,520
on Princess Diana's
whirlwind tour of New York.

368
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,000
Your Royal Highness.

369
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,840
<i>We established
the pediatric AIDS unit two years ago</i>

370
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:48,880
<i>to deal with the rising problem
of infants suffering with the disease.</i>

371
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,560
Hello.

372
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,720
Many of the children had been abandoned

373
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,000
or have parents who are addicts
or sick with the virus.

374
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,120
They desperately need foster parents,
but people are too afraid to take them.

375
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,200
Why?

376
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,520
Because of the stigma.
The fear of the disease.

377
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,360
<i>Chants of
"We want the princess" were heard</i>

378
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,400
<i>in New York's Harlem neighborhood today.</i>

379
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,800
<i>A triumphant end to a trip</i>

380
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,440
<i>which has seen the princess fly solo
for the first time,</i>

381
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,200
<i>hitting new heights
without her husband, Prince Charles.</i>

382
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,800
<i>We love her. She's beautiful. She's warm.</i>

383
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,960
<i>She's perfect. They don't want her there,
we would love to have her here.</i>

384
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:58,360
<i>The way she hugged that boy
in the hospital nearly broke my heart.</i>

385
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,640
<i>Prince Charles is a lucky man.</i>

386
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,080
<i>Princess Di, thank you
for bringing love and vitality</i>

387
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,880
<i>to the Lower East Side!</i>

388
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,400
<i>She knows how to make people feel good,</i>

389
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,000
<i>and that is a God-given talent.
Am I right?</i>

390
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,120
<i>Yeah!</i>

391
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,920
<i>If you care about me as much
as you say you do, sir, you will let go</i>

392
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
<i>of these ideas
of breaking it off with Diana.</i>

393
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,880
Why?

394
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,720
Don't you want us to be free, to…

395
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,000
live our life in the open?

396
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,280
I do.

397
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,120
But I want to be humiliated
and attacked even less.

398
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,640
That's what'll happen if you put me
in a popularity contest against her.

399
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,240
I <i>will </i>lose.

400
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,080
- Oh…
<i>- </i>I'm an old woman.

401
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,320
I'm a married woman.

402
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,080
Nowhere near as pretty,
nowhere near as radiant.

403
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,120
Someone who looks like me
has no place in a fairy tale.

404
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,360
That's all people want, is a fairy tale.

405
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,080
If they knew the truth
about our feelings for one another,

406
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,440
they'd have their fairy tale.

407
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,520
No!

408
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,440
To be the protagonist of a fairy tale,
you must first be wronged.

409
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,040
A victim.

410
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,320
Which, if we were to become public,
we would make her.

411
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,920
In the narrative laws
of fairy tales versus reality…

412
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,840
the fairy tale always prevails.

413
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:35,840
She will… always defeat me
in the court of public opinion.

414
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,560
What is all this, my darling?

415
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,640
What's got into you today?

416
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,000
It's reality, sir.

417
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,120
She's the Princess of Wales.

418
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,280
She's a future queen,
the mother to a future king.

419
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,200
- And I'm just...
- My one… true love.

420
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,960
A mistress.

421
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,520
Mistress to the Prince of Wales, just like
my great-grandmother Alice Keppel

422
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,680
was the mistress to the Prince of Wales,
your great-great-grandfather.

423
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,560
And he loved her till the end.

424
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,560
Leave this with me.

425
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,160
<i>Number 10 is a house
and a home as well as an office,</i>

426
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,400
<i>and as Margaret Thatcher left it
after so long,</i>

427
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,960
<i>there was applause to be heard,</i>

428
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:44,160
<i>and, I'm told, a tear or two shed
among the unseen staff.</i>

429
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,200
<i>Mrs. Thatcher's own voice
had an emotional edge to it.</i>

430
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,080
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

431
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:54,080
<i>we are leaving Downing Street
for the last time</i>

432
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:58,680
<i>after 11 and a half wonderful years.</i>

433
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,880
<i>It was the end of an era
dominated by this woman</i>

434
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,600
<i>whose name has become a political byword.</i>

435
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,400
<i>Eleven years of Thatcherism.</i>

436
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,480
<i>She recovered quickly for one last wave.</i>

437
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,760
<i>But then
the Iron Lady's composure almost broke.</i>

438
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,080
<i>Watch her face as she reaches her car.</i>

439
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:27,800
<i>Friends say that she is deeply shocked
by the seeming injustice of it all.</i>

440
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,160
<i>Three election victories</i>

441
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,360
<i>and a clear, though insufficient,
majority in the first ballot</i>

442
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,800
<i>rewarded, as she sees it, with the sack.</i>

443
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,240
<i>Mrs. Thatcher, of course,
has a new home now in Dulwich…</i>

444
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,320
Martin? Could you ask the prime...

445
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,000
Could you ask Mrs. Thatcher
to come and see me?

446
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,600
When I ascended the throne…

447
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,800
I was just a girl.

448
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,880
Twenty-five years old.

449
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,160
And I was surrounded

450
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:16,320
by stuffy, rather patronizing
gray-haired men everywhere

451
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,760
telling me what to do.

452
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,960
And I wanted to say…

453
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:26,880
the way you dealt with all your stuffy,
rather patronizing gray-haired men

454
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,680
throughout your time in office

455
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,320
and saw them all off…

456
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,240
Well, they've had their revenge now.

457
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,920
I was shocked by the way
in which you were forced to leave office.

458
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,440
And I wanted to offer my sympathy.

459
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,840
Not just as Queen to prime minister…

460
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,680
but woman to woman.

461
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,200
Throughout the time we worked together,

462
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,000
people tended to focus
on our many differences.

463
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:00,200
Which was lazy and misleading, I think.

464
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,200
And overlooked the many things
we do have in common.

465
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,560
Our generation.

466
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,840
Our Christianity.

467
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,520
Our work ethic.

468
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,520
Our sense of duty.

469
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,760
But above all…

470
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,400
our devotion to this country
that we both love.

471
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,160
So with that in mind…

472
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,760
The Order of Merit…

473
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,200
is not awarded by some faceless committee.

474
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,160
It comes at the personal discretion
of the sovereign

475
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,920
and is in recognition
of exceptionally meritorious service.

476
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,920
It is limited to just 24 recipients,

477
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,120
no matter their background.

478
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,200
You could be the daughter of a duke.

479
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,440
Or a greengrocer.

480
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,600
What matters… is your accomplishments.

481
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,240
And nobody can deny…

482
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,200
that this is a very different country now

483
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,480
to the one inherited
by our first woman prime minister.

484
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,280
Now, it's normally handed over in the box.

485
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,720
But if you would allow me…

486
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,040
Congratulations.

487
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,440
It's kind of you to come.

488
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,600
Why would you say that?

489
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,760
I think
even my sternest critics would concede

490
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,480
that my first solo trip
has not been a disaster,

491
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,760
that I didn't fall
totally flat on my face.

492
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:28,080
So I can only imagine, hope,
that you've come here to apologize,

493
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,600
to eat your words,

494
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,520
and congratulate me.

495
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:37,080
Your… capacity for self-delusion…

496
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,360
never ceases to amaze me.

497
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,280
We're all glad
you're back where you belong

498
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:46,840
without too much damage done.
You have two sons that need you.

499
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:50,200
Our sons have easily survived
me being away four days.

500
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,760
I'm not sure
one can say the same for the rest of us.

501
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,640
The exquisite selfishness of your motives

502
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,720
and the…

503
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,480
the <i>calculated </i>vulgarity of the antics…

504
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,440
knowing full well
the headlines they would get.

505
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,640
"Antics"?

506
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,360
Grandstanding like that.

507
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,680
You think we couldn't do that too?

508
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,840
Theatrically hug the wretched
and the dispossessed

509
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,240
and cover ourselves in glory
on the front pages?

510
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,480
I doubt it.

511
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,400
You barely find it in yourselves
to hug your own.

512
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,680
I hug who I want to.

513
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,760
I hug who I love.

514
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,560
Particularly when they are affected
by the selfishness of others

515
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,480
and need cheering up.

516
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,680
- Who are you referring to?
- Camilla.

517
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,720
Why would I care about her?

518
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,280
Because I care about her!

519
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,280
Morning, noon, and night,
I care about her!

520
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,000
And you hurt her.

521
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,600
And if you hurt her…

522
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,520
you hurt me.

523
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,360
Camilla is who I want.

524
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,360
That is where my loyalties lie.

525
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,800
- That is who my priority is.
- Not the mother of your children?

526
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:13,280
- Don't bring the boys into this.
- All right. Not the woman you married!

527
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:17,160
I refuse to be blamed any longer
for this grotesque misalliance!

528
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,120
I wash my hands of it!

529
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,400
If you have a complaint…

530
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,080
about…

531
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,960
not being loved…

532
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
or appreciated in this marriage…

533
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,840
I suggest you take it up
with the people who arranged it.

534

562
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,360
He is learning. He is.

563
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,720
He's doing much better.

564
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,400
She tells jokes,

565
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,960
but she starts with the punchline,
which sounds funnier than the joke.

566
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,160
There you are.

567
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:33,920
Mama.

568
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:41,680
Well, I'm sure no one told you,
but I made a request through my office

569
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,400
for us to find a moment
to speak together, in private.

570
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,400
I hope you're not wanting to talk here.

571
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,840
No, not here.

572
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,760
Or now. The dogs need feeding.

573
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,216
- The dogs.
- Yes, the dogs.

574
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,760
We'll have to find another time.

575
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,280
Who's hungry?

576
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,920
Are you all hungry?

577
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,640
Who'll tell me about their day?

578
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,120
Hello! Have you had a lovely day?
Have you had fun?

579
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,560
- What are you doing here?
- I hope you don't mind.

580
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:28,000
- I thought we might find a moment alone.
- Honestly, both of you!

581
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,360
Both of us?

582
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,920
You and your wife
ambushing me everywhere I go

583
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,920
with anxious looks, wanting to talk.

584
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,520
I do want to talk, Mummy.

585
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,960
We need to talk.

586
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,400
Fine. Let's talk.

587
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,520
Might I request
we do it like privy counsellors?

588
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,600
On our feet to keep it brief.

589
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,040
It's the marriage.

590
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,520
I had a horrible idea
we were going in this direction.

591
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,120
I have done my best.

592
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,840
My very best, and I am suffering!

593
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:06,000
No, you are not suffering. We're suffering
having to put up with this!

594
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,440
Let me make something clear.

595
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:11,760
When people look at you and Diana,
they see two privileged young people

596
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,040
who, through good fortune,

597
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,480
ended up with everything
one could dream of in life.

598
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,000
No one, not a single breathing,
living soul <i>anywhere,</i>

599
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,240
sees cause for suffering.

600
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,320
- They would if they knew.
- Knew what?

601
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,320
They know that you betray your wife

602
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,160
and make no attempt to hide it.

603
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,760
They know that thanks to you,
she has psychological problems

604
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:31,800
and eats or doesn't eat
or whatever it is she does or doesn't do.

605
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:35,960
They know you're a spoiled, immature man,
endlessly complaining unnecessarily,

606
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:39,440
married to a spoiled, immature woman,
endlessly complaining unnecessarily.

607
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,680
And we are all heartily sick of it.

608
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:45,240
All anyone wants is for the pair of you
to pull yourselves together,

609
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:48,280
stop making spectacles of yourselves,
and make this marriage

610
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:51,160
and your enormously privileged
positions in life work.

611
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,720
And if I want to separate?

612
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,080
You will <i>not </i>separate or divorce
or let the side down in any way.

613
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,440
- And if one day you expect to be king...
- I do.

614
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:01,120
Then might I suggest
you start to behave like one.

615
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,760
- Rabbit, right in the head.
- No!

616
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,360
Have you seen Diana?

617
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:15,760
Come.

618
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,240
Hello?

619
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,160
Ah.

620
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,440
Oh, please, no.

621
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,160
I, uh, I came to see if you're all right.

622
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:35,760
Do you know, I… I don't think
I've ever seen inside this room.

623
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,200
We can be a rough bunch in this family.

624
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,400
And I'm sure, on occasion,

625
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:49,120
to a sensitive creature like you,

626
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,280
it must feel like…

627
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,720
Well, let me ask. What does it feel like?

628
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,720
A cold, frozen tundra.

629
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:02,240
Right.

630
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,680
Like that, then.

631
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,440
An icy, dark,

632
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,880
loveless cave…

633
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,280
with no light…

634
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,800
no hope… anywhere.

635
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,400
Not even the faintest crack.

636
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,120
I see.

637
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,120
He will come around.

638
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:29,800
He will.

639
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:31,440
Eventually.

640
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:33,960
When he realizes that…

641
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,960
he can never have the other one.

642
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:47,240
Would it help you to realize
we all think he's quite mad?

643
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:50,520
That might have reassured me once.

644
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,840
But I worry we're past that point now.

645
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:54,640
Sir.

646
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
And if he…

647
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:03,560
If this family can't give me the love
and security that I feel I deserve,

648
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,080
then I believe I have no option

649
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:08,920
but to break away, officially…
and find it myself.

650
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,040
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- Why not?

651
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:14,320
Let's just say
I can't see it ending well for you.

652
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,600
I hope that isn't a threat, sir.

653
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:21,160
No, not now. Out!

654
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,600
Although we are both outsiders
who married in,

655
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,320
you and I are quite different.

656
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Yes.

657
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:44,720
I can see that now.

658
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,280
You're right to call me an outsider.

659
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:55,760
I was an outsider the day that I met the…

660
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:00,760
the 13-year-old princess
who would one day become my wife.

661
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,520
And after all these years…

662
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:08,720
I still am.

663
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:11,520
We all are.

664
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:14,840
Everyone…

665
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,080
<i>in this system…</i>

666
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,280
<i>is a lost…</i>

667
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:19,720
<i>lonely…</i>

668
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,840
<i>irrelevant outsider…</i>

669
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,960
<i>apart from the one person,</i>

670
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,440
<i>the only person,</i>

671
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,120
<i>that matters.</i>

672
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,920
<i>She is the oxygen we all breathe.</i>

673
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,200
<i>The essence of all our duty.</i>

674
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,440
Your problem, if I may say…

675
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,560
is you seem to be confused
about who that person is.

676
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:55,520
Come!

677
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:02,000
Just to say, Your Royal Highnesses,
the photographer is ready.

678
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,080
Thank you.

679
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,760
Everyone,
we're going to do the photograph.

680
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,640
Don't you think the Queen
would be best suited in the middle?

681
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,120
Charles is pushing in.

682
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,360
You stay outside.

683
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,840
No squabbling, please.

684
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,120
Quiet. Quiet.

685
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:33,880
Ah, yes.

686
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,200
The merriest of Christmas smiles!

687
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,160
Yes.

688
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:38,760
Three, two, one…

689
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,600
Done. Did anyone blink?
