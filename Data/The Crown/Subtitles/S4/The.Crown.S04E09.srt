1
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,320
- Are we late?
- Sorry.

2
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,320
Go, go, go!

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,200
…said to the bishop,
if you catch my drift!

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,000
Oh, you are naughty!

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,520
Brrr…

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,600
Here you are.

7
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,360
- Dress ready, darling?
- Yes, here we are.

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,120
- Shoes?
- Here we go.

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,200
Good.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,440
How many people in the world
<i>actually </i>know about this?

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Four.

12
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,000
<i>The crowds out in force tonight
outside the Royal Opera House</i>

13
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:49,200
<i>to welcome Their Royal Highnesses
the Prince and Princess of Wales.</i>

14
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,480
<i>The Prince, of course, is the president
of the Friends of Covent Garden</i>

15
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,240
<i>who are hosting tonight's event.</i>

16
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,880
<i>Princess Diana,
in a strapless lilac chiffon gown</i>

17
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,680
<i>printed with gold pattern,
receiving the attention.</i>

18
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,400
<i>But it's the prince's night.</i>

19
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,520

Happy birthday!

50
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,040
What were you thinking?

51
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,240
I was trying to make you happy.

52
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,400
That grotesque, mortifying display
had nothing to do with me or my happiness.

53
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,800
Eight minutes they were on their feet,

54
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,960
cheering <i>you.</i>

55
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,680
Tomorrow the newspapers
will be about nothing other than you.

56
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,800
People will see
it was about my feelings for you.

57
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,880
If you had any feelings for me,
if you had… any understanding of me…

58
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,120
if you had anything between your ears
other than self-obsession,

59
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,600
you would know
public displays like that horrify me.

60
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,280
- Everything I do seems to horrify you.
- Increasingly, yes!

61
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,880
I never thought you'd manage this,
but you're really succeeding now.

62
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,320
- And what's that?
- I'm starting to properly loathe you!

63
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,400
What's taken you so long?

64
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,520
The rest of us have been there
for some time!

65
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,440
- What are you doing?
- I'm going back to Gloucestershire.

66
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,360
Of course.

67
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,920
It's where <i>she'll</i> be waiting for you.

68
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,960
I'm sure she'll know
exactly how to make you happy.

69
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,560
<i>Charles and Diana
seem to be getting on again.</i>

70
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,240
Hallelujah.

71
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,640
Apparently, she surprised him with a dance
last night at the opera house.

72
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,160
- Really?
- Full of high kicks and spins.

73
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,400
Why did you never do that for me?

74
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,920
- Dance on your birthday?
- Yes.

75
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,560
Like Salome.

76
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,160
Because, if memory serves,
you had your own ballerinas for that.

77
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,480
Honestly.

78
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,320
The rubbish you talk sometimes.

79
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,600
It says here they're off to Switzerland,
skiing with friends.

80
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,200
Perhaps their marriage
has turned a corner.

81
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,600
Now, much more importantly,
who is Billy "Jo-el"?

82
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,040
Billy Joel.

83
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,160
- Oh, <i>Joel.</i>
- Yes.

84
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,440
"Uptown Girl."

85
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,480
What are you talking about?

86
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,840
Right.

87
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,520
Right. Obviously,
the minute you can confirm anything.

88
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,200
Anything at all.

89
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,600
I need to see the Queen
and the Duke of Edinburgh immediately.

90
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,336
<i>Prince Charles has been
caught in an avalanche</i>

91
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,120
<i>at the Swiss resort of Klosters.</i>

92
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,440
<i>The Prince of Wales was skiing
with a group of friends</i>

93
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,680
<i>when the avalanche struck
at a quarter to three…</i>

94
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,280
<i>…had been the warning
of possible avalanches in the region</i>

95
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,360
<i>after heavy snowfall…</i>

96
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,880
<i>Rescue helicopters
are attending the scene,</i>

97
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,760
<i>but it is not known
whether the prince has survived.</i>

98
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,120
<i>A desperate rescue operation
is now underway.</i>

99
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,320
<i>Efforts to locate the prince continue…</i>

100
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,520
They were on the Haglamadd,

101
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,360
a notoriously challenging off-piste slope…

102
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,600
um…

103
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,200
when the avalanche struck.

104
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,480
It seems that two of the party
were hit and swept away.

105
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,120
What...

106
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,600
Why were they even skiing
if the conditions were dangerous?

107
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,160
Conditions this morning
were apparently ideal.

108
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,040
And a male body has been found?

109
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,360
Those are the first
unconfirmed reports, yes.

110
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,480
Obviously, every effort possible
is being made to identify the body,

111
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,160
but should the unthinkable
turn out to be true

112
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,200
and the Prince of Wales is in fact, um…

113
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,120
Um…

114
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,160
We have contingency plans in place
for all members of the royal family.

115
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,480
"Menai Bridge" is no exception.

116
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,800
It's the code name
for the death of the Prince of Wales.

117
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,080
Yes, thank you, Martin.

118
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,600
Why bridges?

119
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,880
We're all bridges.

120
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,040
I'm London Bridge. Mummy's Tay Bridge.
You're Forth Bridge.

121
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,480
The choice of name…

122
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,960
was to suggest a link
between this life and…

123
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,000
and the next.

124
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,280
We've had it confirmed.

125
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,280
The Prince of Wales is safe, ma'am.

126
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,640
Although one of the guests,
Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson,

127
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,880
is still in intensive care,

128
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,240
and the one fatality… was Hugh Lindsay.

129
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,960
- Oh no.
- His wife…

130
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,960
uh, widow…

131
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,040
works in the press office.

132
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,440
- Sarah.
- Mmm.

133
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,640
- If you wanted to send a letter…
- Of course.

134
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,720
Martin?

135
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,240
Yes, ma'am, just to say…

136
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,880
along with the coverage
of His Royal Highness's near escape,

137
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,760
we should also brace ourselves
for more speculation…

138
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,160
about the Waleses' marriage.

139
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,680
It seems the prince and princess
had not been on the best of terms

140
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,320
prior to the accident,
and we'd received reports of…

141
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,560
arguments and raised voices.

142
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,720
Certain newspapers
were about to run stories,

143
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,200
and although we might expect a reprieve
of a few days, given the circumstances,

144
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,080
we can't expect it to last for long.

145
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,120
Ma'am.

146
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,000
<i>The Prince and Princess of Wales
are traveling back to Britain</i>

147
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,640
<i>this afternoon,
following a devastating accident</i>

148
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,560
<i>that has cut short
their skiing holiday in Switzerland.</i>

149
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:54,120
<i>On board their flight
will be the body of Major Hugh Lindsay,</i>

150
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,880
<i>a close friend of the couple,
who died in the avalanche yesterday.</i>

151
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,240
<i>The Prince of Wales was himself
only inches away from death…</i>

152
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,080
- They said you were on your way.
- Hello, darling.

153
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,960
Oh, thank you.

154
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,040
What have I done now?

155
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,320
You? Nothing.

156
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,600
But as his sister and confidante,

157
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,800
I thought you might throw some light
on a subject

158
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,080
about which I've been ostriching, rather.

159
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,440
The true state of Charles's marriage.

160
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,880
You don't want to know.

161
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,760
Actually, I do.

162
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,640
- Tea?
- Yes, please.

163
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,040
Thank you.

164
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,480
The truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?

165
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,920
Please.

166
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,160
All right.

167
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,960
Once upon a time,
there was a beautiful young girl

168
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,320
who fell madly in love
with a handsome prince.

169
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,920
Unfortunately, the prince
was already in love with someone else,

170
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,880
who was herself in love with someone else,
and they all lived unhappily ever after.

171
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,840
That's it, in a nutshell.
Do you need more?

172
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,440
A little.

173
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,600
There's already a big age difference,

174
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,400
but Charles is older than his years,
and Diana is younger than hers,

175
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,200
which makes it not an age gap
but an age chasm.

176
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,600
On the face of it, they come from
similar aristocratic backgrounds,

177
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,160
but their personalities
come from different planets.

178
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,160
They have different interests,
different friends.

179
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,840
He doesn't understand her.
She doesn't understand him.

180
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,840
And considering all that,
they've done remarkably well.

181
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,480
But…

182
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,840
there comes a point
in any failing marriage,

183
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,880
and here I speak with some experience,

184
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,840
when you realize
there's no point in trying anymore,

185
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,760
and it's easier
to just let the current take you away.

186
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,280
And the minute Harry was born
and duty was done,

187
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,840
the marriage was effectively over,

188
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,400
and they started to find comfort
in the arms of others.

189
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,840
How many others?

190
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,080
Diana's been with her bodyguard,

191
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,520
her riding instructor…

192
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,480
- And Charles?
- He's just been with one.

193
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,920
He's also been a bit more discreet.

194
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
The only people who know about Camilla…

195
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:32,600
Pretty much the whole of Gloucestershire,
who all seem involved in facilitating it.

196
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,760
You can't conduct an extramarital affair
without somewhere to meet or sleep or...

197
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,960
Yes, thank you.

198
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,040
But Diana…

199
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,280
Aunt Margot tells me at Kensington Palace,
it's like a revolving door.

200
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,520
That…

201
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,880
"suitors" park outside her office

202
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,240
because it's the only place
with no security cameras.

203
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,880
One after another.

204
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,120
In and out.

205
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,400
In and out.

206
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,920
Unfortunately,
the Wales marriage is a rare example

207
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,160
of something that is actually worse
than the newspapers report.

208
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,720
Sir…

209
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,120
the Queen has asked to see you
and the Princess of Wales

210
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,880
at the earliest opportunity.

211
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,120
<i>You must be
so shocked by what's happened.</i>

212
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,320
<i>It's all
too awful to comprehend.</i>

213
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,280
<i>But there is something I want to tell you.</i>

214
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,120
<i>In the moment
the avalanche was bearing down on me,</i>

215
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,400
<i>in that ghastly moment
where I was sure I was going to die,</i>

216
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,640
<i>I had a profound realization.</i>

217
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,800
<i>This whole thing…</i>

218
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,840
<i>my marriage, this situation,</i>

219
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,000
<i>the whole charade is madness.</i>

220
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,200
- Hi.
- Hey!

221
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,280
<i>I only want to be with you.</i>

222
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,560
But you are with me.

223
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,000
<i>I mean fully. Completely.</i>

224
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
<i>As my wife.</i>

225
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,080
Oh, darling…

226
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,640
<i>The rest of it is just a terrible lie</i>

227
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,720
<i>that is making everyone involved in it,</i>
everyone, <i>utterly wretched.</i>

228
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,800
Sir?

229
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,680
Thank you, Nigel.

230
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,800
Mummy.

231
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,960
Thank you both for coming.

232
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,080
I asked you here today
because word has reached me

233
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,520
about the difficulties
you're experiencing.

234
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,960
But something as important
as the marriage of the future monarch

235
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,440
simply cannot be allowed to fail.

236
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,280
Your marriage, all our marriages,

237
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,520
are a reflection
on the integrity of the Crown.

238
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,720
And if they show cracks…

239
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,840
that they cannot be relied upon,
then the constancy and stability

240
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:15,120
that the monarchy is supposed to represent
is called into question too.

241
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,360
So I would like to ask
one fundamental question of you both.

242
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,680
Does either of you
no longer want this marriage to work?

243
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,440
Well…

244
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,920
now that you mention it…

245
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,520
I have given it all some thought.

246
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,680
- And...
- No.

247
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,800
Wait!

248
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,760
I still want to make this marriage work.

249
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,160
With all my heart.

250
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,480
Then why have you broken your vows,
as I understand you have?

251
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,520
Because…

252
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,760
sometimes…

253
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,920
you don't know
how you feel about something…

254
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,920
until you've nearly had it taken away.

255
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,920
The moment I heard about the avalanche,

256
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,400
and the possibility that Charles might've…

257
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,800
I can't even say it.

258
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,880
In that instant,

259
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,880
I felt an overwhelming emptiness and loss.

260
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,960
And for the first time,

261
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,920
I saw all the hurt and the pain
that I've been inflicting on you…

262
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,960
and you on me.

263
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,080
And suddenly, it all seemed so childish.

264
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,760
So pointless.

265
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,920
And do you understand
what it takes to make a marriage work?

266
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,400
The respect one must show the other party.

267
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,240
The blind eyes one needs to turn.

268
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,320
The arrangements both of you must come to.

269
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,760
The freedoms both of you must respect.

270
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,840
And the rules you must abide by.

271
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,600
I am ready… to commit… to anything.

272
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,280
To go to any lengths.

273
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,920
And I want to say to you…

274
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,880
that I'm sorry…

275
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,480
for my part…

276
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,680
in everything.

277
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,320
Good. Well, that's that, then.

278
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,400
What?

279
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,640
Do I get a chance to speak?

280
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,840
And say what?

281
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,760
What else is there to say?

282
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,920
It's a nightmare.

283
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,000
I had the whole speech prepared,
then out of nowhere, Diana does that.

284
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,880
Ambushes me like that.

285
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,760
And Mummy, well, you know her.

286
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,800
So grateful the subject was over,

287
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,040
she couldn't get out of the room
quickly enough.

288
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,760
Well, I won't let this go.

289
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,600
I spoke to my protection officers.

290
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,880
They all know what she gets up to,
and if anything happens,

291
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,240
if Diana puts
even the slightest foot wrong,

292
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,760
if she even thinks about straying…

293
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,320
they'll let me know.

294
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,560
Major Hewitt's gone.

295
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,760
Eyes… left.

296
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,600
<i>I gave him the heave-ho.</i>

297
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,440
<i>Everyone else too.</i>

298
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,080
No more little flirtations.

299
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,640
No more plan Bs.

300
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,120
All doors firmly shut.

301
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,800
Any more telephone calls
from Major Hewitt,

302
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,320
make sure to say I'm out.

303
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,280
I don't want to hear from him.

304
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,080
He can't just show up.

305
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,720
He's not welcome here anymore.

306
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,800
Ma'am.

307
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,520
<i>For the first time,
things do feel different.</i>

308
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,120
I feel different.

309
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,520
Because I've realized how much
I want to make this marriage work.

310
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,960
And to that end,
with our seventh anniversary coming up…

311
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,280
Well…

312
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,320
I've had some ideas.

313
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,800
On the 21st, we have lunch

314
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,400
at the Community Enterprise Trust
in Hartlepool,

315
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,640
followed by a turf-cutting ceremony

316
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,440
at Hilton Colliery redevelopment site
in Sunderland.

317
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,560
What about the 22nd?

318
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,440
A presentation of new colors

319
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,840
to the 1st Battalion Gordon Highlanders
at Fort George, Inverness.

320
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:42,720
I'm trying to find time for a weekend
in Scotland with Mrs. Parker Bowles.

321
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,080
What about the 29th?

322
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,240
- That might be tricky.
- Why? I'm free the day before.

323
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,440
I'm not due back in Cornwall
until the 2nd, which is a Tuesday.

324
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,280
The 29th is your wedding anniversary, sir.

325
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,600
Of course.

326
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,320
As a matter of fact,

327
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,440
the Princess of Wales made a point

328
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,680
of requesting
you be in Highgrove that weekend.

329
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,000
She said
she had something specific in mind.

330
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,600
<i>♪ I just can't handle it ♪</i>

331
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,600
<i>♪ This thing called love ♪</i>

332
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,800
<i>♪ I must get round to it ♪</i>

333
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,360
<i>♪ I ain't ready ♪</i>

334
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,280
<i>♪ Crazy little thing called love ♪</i>

335
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,920
<i>♪ Be cool, relax ♪</i>

336
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,920
<i>♪ Get hip
And get on my tracks ♪</i>

337
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,080
<i>♪ Take a back seat, hitchhike ♪</i>

338
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,440
<i>♪ And take a long ride on my motorbike ♪</i>

339
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:14,800
<i>♪ Until I'm ready
Crazy little thing called love ♪</i>

340
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,240
- Who's that?
- Hello, boys.

341
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,320
Come on. Let's have you.

342
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,720
In you go. Come on.

343
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,200
There's three more over there!

344
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,000
Three in a boat!

345
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,440
Prince overboard!

346
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,040
I'm coming!

347
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,200
- Push me, Harry!
- I'll help.

348
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,200
Right.

349
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Thank you.

350
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,760
Gosh.

351
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,360
Oh, we haven't done our presents.

352
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,880
Right. Yes.

353
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,560
Thank you.

354
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:34,760
<i>Aedes Althorpianae.</i>
The history of your family home.

355
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:39,160
Commissioned by your
great-great-great grandfather in 1822.

356
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,000
It's a first edition.

357
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,480
Oh, Charles, that's lovely.

358
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,960
Thank you.

359
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,240
Now me.

360
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,560
It's a bit smaller.

361
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,080
Mmm.

362
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,760
Thank you.

363
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,760
I know how horrified you were
the last time I performed for you,

364
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,800
about how public it was.

365
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,400
I wasn't horrified.

366
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,480
Yes, you were.

367
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,960
I was… a little shocked.

368
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,840
Taken by surprise.

369
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,800
I know.

370
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,280
But I love to perform.

371
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,440
It's how I can best express myself,

372
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,040
and…

373
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,760
how I can show what I really feel.

374
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,360
So this time,

375
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,040
it's just between us.

376
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,000
No public. No one watching.

377
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,160
- What is this?
- Wait, watch.

<i>I thought the agony she inflicted on me
at the opera house couldn't be topped.</i>

394
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,840
<i>What was it?</i>

395
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:22,640
A video of Diana
singing some dreadful song

396
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,960
in some musical.

397
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,320
<i>- Phantom of the Opera. </i>Imagine!
- What?

398
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:31,880
On the actual stage in the West End,
in costume, with all the real actors.

399
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,840
- Singing?
- If you could call it that.

400
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,320
I didn't know where to look.

401
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,080
The chap playing the Phantom
at least had a mask to hide behind!

402
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,880
Honestly, there's nothing more exhausting
than putting on a kind face.

403
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,200
I never realized how much scaffolding
a smile required.

404
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,440
When is this nightmare
ever going to end?

405
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,040
- Oh, Charles.
- What?

406
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,480
I'm going to be frank with you.

407
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,280
No one wants your marriage to end,
not a single person.

408
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,480
Not Diana, not your children,

409
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,920
not your mother or father, not me,
not a single one of your friends,

410
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,960
and, most importantly,
not even the woman you think loves you.

411
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,520
- Oh, what rubbish!
- No, listen!

412
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,640
Listen to me.

413
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,680
No one can bear to watch
the mess you are making,

414
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,880
and someone
needs to explain things to you.

415
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,760
I'm close to Camilla's husband,
as you know…

416
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,840
Yes, I'm aware.

417
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,120
…and speak to Andrew regularly. And
while theirs is not a perfect marriage…

418
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,040
Understatement.

419
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,760
…it is a long-lasting marriage.

420
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,600
And, in its own way, a happy marriage.

421
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,040
- She's <i>not </i>happy.
- She's happier than you think.

422
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:32,080
- That he's bedding most of her friends?
- It's complicated!

423
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:37,000
The majority of marriages survive because
the majority of people aren't fantasists.

424
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,120
They are realists

425
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,080
and accept the imperfect reality
of being human.

426
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,280
And although Camilla doubtless
has feelings for you, deep feelings,

427
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,720
it is maybe not quite
the great Romeo-Juliet thing you imagine.

428
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,640
What? You're lying.

429
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,080
No, I'm not. I'm trying to protect you.

430
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,080
I come here seeking comfort
from my sibling, and what do I get?

431
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,360
The unvarnished truth.

432
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,760
What does one have to do
to get some kindness in this family?

433
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,560
I can't stay long. The children are home.

434
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,120
I need to know.

435
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,520
Do you still have feelings for Andrew?

436
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,440
- What?
- I don't mean normal feelings.

437
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,040
He's your husband
and the father of your children.

438
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,880
I mean special feelings.

439
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,720
Anne told me that…

440
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,120
Andrew, not I,
was the big love of your life,

441
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,520
and that… your feelings for me
were perhaps not as deep as I'd imagined.

442
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,760
That's not true.

443
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:32,720
Andrew has never adored me like you do.
Or shown me the same devotion.

444
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,000
He also doesn't need me like you do.

445
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,120
I do need you.

446
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,680
And that's why it's so important…

447
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,200
we both feel the same…

448
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,040
and want the same.

449
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,080
And that if the opportunity
were to present itself…

450
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,520
and I were able to escape this…

451
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,360
…calamity of a marriage…

452
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,040
that you'd be prepared
to do the same thing and leave Andrew.

453
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,800
Can you make me that promise?

454
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,360
What we both want and what we can
actually do are not the same thing.

455
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,560
It's important we remain realistic, sir.

456
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,880
But you have my word.

457
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,840
My love for you is real.

458
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,000
I should go.

459
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,080
<i>…and the environments
are being damaged.</i>

460
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:18,600
<i>Mrs. Thatcher has been welcomed in
Canberra by the Australian prime minister…</i>

461
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,720
<i>And one</i>…

462
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,360
and two and three and four

463
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,200
and turn towards the barre…

464
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,800
And arms like this.

465
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,040
Come along, Diana.

466
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:56,840
And… and again.
And one and two and three and…

467
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,440
Highgrove.

468
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,640
Sir, the Princess of Wales on the phone.

469
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:15,720
No.

470
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,480
Very good.
