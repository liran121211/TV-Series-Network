1
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,896
- Everybody set?
- Ready, sir.

2
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,120
Yes. Yes, hurry up. Hurry up.

3
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,240
Operator ready.

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,320
Right.

5
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,360
Absolute silence, everywhere.

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:30,920
Cue disc.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,240
Live recording.

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,840
Ready, Your Royal Highness?

9
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,920
Five,

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
four,

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,200
three,

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,280
two,

13
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,760
one,

14
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,800
and…

15
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,880
"On this…

16
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,200
the occasion of my 21st birthday…

17
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,320
I welcome the opportunity

18
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,880
to speak to all the peoples
of the British Commonwealth and Empire…

19
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,040
wherever they live,

20
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,280
whatever race they come from,

21
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,840
and whatever language they speak.

22
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,160
As I speak to you today from Cape Town,

23
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,120
I am 6,000 miles from the country
where I was born.

24
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,960
But I am certainly not
6,000 miles from home.

25
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,480
That is the great privilege
of belonging to our place

26
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,400
in the worldwide Commonwealth.

27
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,240
There are homes ready to welcome us
in every continent of the earth.

28
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,400
<i>Before I am much elder,</i>

29
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,880
<i>I hope I shall come to know many of them.</i>

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,640
<i>Although there is none
of my father's subjects,</i>

31
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,160
<i>from the eldest to the youngest,
whom I do not wish to greet,</i>

32
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,280
<i>I am thinking especially today
of all the young men and women</i>

33
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,960
<i>who were born
about the same time as myself</i>

34
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,320
<i>and have grown up like me</i>

35
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,120
<i>in the terrible and glorious years
of the Second World War.</i>

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,600
<i>Will you, the youth
of the British family of nations,</i>

37
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,640
<i>let me speak on my birthday
as your representative?</i>

38
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,320
<i>Now that we are coming to manhood
and womanhood,</i>

39
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,000
<i>it is surely a great joy to us all
to think that we shall be able</i>

40
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,600
<i>to take some of the burden
off the shoulders of our elders,</i>

41
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,360
<i>who have fought and worked
and suffered to protect our childhood.</i>

42
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,080
<i>To that generation,</i>

43
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,120
<i>I say we must not be daunted</i>

44
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,040
<i>by the anxieties and hardships
the war has left behind</i>

45
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,320
<i>for every nation of our Commonwealth.</i>

46
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,640
<i>We know these things are the price
we cheerfully undertook to pay</i>

47
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,520
<i>for the high honor of standing alone
seven years ago</i>

48
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,680
<i>in defense of the liberty of the world.</i>

49
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,600
<i>If we all go forward together
with an unwavering faith,</i>

50
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,800
<i>a high courage, and a quiet heart…"</i>

51
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,200
<i>"…we shall be able
to make of this ancient Commonwealth,</i>

52
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,960
<i>which we all love so dearly,</i>

53
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,080
<i>an even grander thing.</i>

54
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,320
More free, more prosperous,

55
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,960
more happy,

56
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,400
<i>and a more powerful influence
for good in the world</i>

57
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,800
<i>than it has been
in the greatest days of our forefathers."</i>

58
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,800
<i>Please welcome Margaret Roberts.</i>

59
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,360
<i>"To accomplish that…</i>

60
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,320
<i>we must give nothing less</i>

61
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,240
<i>than what my father, King George,
the first head of the Commonwealth,</i>

62
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,000
<i>calls 'the whole of ourselves.'"</i>

63
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,080
Good evening.

64
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,800
<i>"There is a motto which
has been borne by many of my ancestors.</i>

65
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,960
<i>A noble motto.</i>

66
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,760
<i>'I serve.'</i>

67
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,560
<i>I should like to make that dedication now.</i>

68
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,960
<i>- It's very simple."</i>
- And smile!

69
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,440
"I declare before you all
that my whole life…

70
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,720
whether it be long or short…

71
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,960
shall be devoted to your service…

72
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,320
and the service
of our great imperial family

73
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,760
to which we all belong.

74
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,720
God help me to make good my vow…

75
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,280
and God bless all of you

76
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,720
who are willing to share in it."

77
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,400
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Thank you.

78
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,120
<i>It was the volte-face of Eurydice,</i>

79
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,480
<i>except I was Aristaeus,</i>

80
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,160
<i>driving her on towards the serpent…</i>

81
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,320
<i>Malachi, Maaalachi…</i>

82
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,200
<i>Twice, she called me by the name,</i>

83
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,240
<i>and twice she beckoned me
with her outstretched dactyl…</i>

84
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,120
<i>I stood in darkness. She in light.</i>

85
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,360
<i>And yet here I was the diurnal,</i>

86
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,280
<i>and she the crepuscular,</i>

87
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,480
<i>if such a…</i>

88
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,520
<i>…nugatory distinction can pertain.</i>

89
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,520
<i>The aurora was breaking.</i>

90
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,680
<i>The island, sea-girt, was fast stirring.</i>

91
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,000
<i>I looked at her again.</i>

92
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,400
<i>Her dermis,
pellucid in the lambent sunshine,</i>

93
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,560
<i>seemed as if a fish-skin pulled taut.</i>

94
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,800
<i>She gave me one last glancing look,</i>

95
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,840
<i>and then stepped off</i>

96
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,000
<i>and plunged down
into the waxing viridescence</i>

97
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,000
<i>of the Ionian waters below…</i>

98
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,720
Mors tua, vita mea.

99
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,680
<i>The End.</i>

100
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,280
Golly! Your very own <i>War and Peace.</i>

101
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,840
<i>Ulysses, </i>please.

102
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,880
Uh…

103
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,640
I shall… set aside a year of my life.

104
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,360
- What?
- Just kidding.

105
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,360
I'll have it read by the end of next week.

106
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,920
- You're very kind.
- And, Michael, bravo!

107
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,520
Ah-ah!
No congratulations till you've read it.

108
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,400
You deserve congratulations

109
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,320
for being able to carry it up the stairs.
Kidding again.

110
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,560
Oh.

111
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,640
Well…

112
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,680
I look forward…

113
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,520
to hearing from you.

114
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,560
Uh, taxi!

115
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,440
- Buckingham Palace, please.
- Right you are, sir.

116
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,400
Good work. Leave it on my desk.

117
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,560
- Morning, James.
- Morning, sir.

118
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,480
- Morning, Michael.
- Sarah.

119
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,560
Sorry to ambush you,

120
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,440
but I've got the <i>Today </i>newspaper
asking for confirmation

121
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,160
of an apparently open secret
in Commonwealth government circles,

122
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,280
that the Queen is deeply frustrated
by Thatcher's refusal

123
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,840
to back sanctions against
the apartheid regime in South Africa.

124
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,920
A frustration which threatens to strain
her relationship with the prime minister,

125
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,120
who the Queen holds
personally responsible,

126
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,840
and they'd like you,
as palace press secretary, to comment.

127
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,840
You should know better than to come to me
with nonsense like that, Sarah.

128
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,360
In the 33 years she's been on the throne,

129
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,280
the Queen has never once expressed
a point of view about her prime ministers,

130
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,440
positive or negative,

131
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,560
and never will.

132
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,000
Political impartiality

133
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,240
and support of her prime minister
is an article of faith to her.

134
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,480
And we all know how the Queen is…

135
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,880
about her faith.

136
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,240
…<i>the now
all too familiar use of violence.</i>

137
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,960
<i>Tear gas, followed by rubber bullets,
and then bird shot.</i>

138
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,640
<i>It's been nearly four decades
since the system of racial segregation</i>,

139
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,400
<i>termed apartheid, became
the official policy of South Africa.</i>

140
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,200
<i>The current violent oppression
of Black protesters by government forces</i>

141
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,120
<i>is creating
increased international outrage.</i>

142
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,160
<i>The situation is
getting worse and worse, ma'am.</i>

143
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,280
<i>Countless instances of brutality
by the South African police</i>

144
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,160
<i>against members of the public.</i>

145
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,120
As you know, we believe the only way
to stop these atrocities

146
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,520
is through sustained economic pressure.
Forty-eight of the Commonwealth countries

147
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,680
are committed to imposing
a policy of sanctions on Pretoria

148
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,160
to try and bring down
the apartheid regime.

149
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,720
But, as Her Majesty knows,

150
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,760
in order to implement those sanctions,
total unanimity is required,

151
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,840
and one country remains against.

152
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,040
The United Kingdom.

153
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,080
Mrs. Thatcher remains opposed.

154
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,760
I will have an opportunity to speak
to Mrs. Thatcher about all this in private

155
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:42,240
at the forthcoming Commonwealth Heads
of Government Meeting in the Bahamas.

156
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,400
<i>The Commonwealth.</i>

157
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,880
Ridiculous waste of time.

158
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,920
Ridiculous organization.

159
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,800
Worse. Morally offensive.

160
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,200
Why we allow our Queen

161
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:03,880
to fraternize with countries like Uganda,
Malawi, Nigeria, Swaziland…

162
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,320
Unstable countries.

163
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:14,360
Unstable despotisms
with appalling human rights records.

164
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,960
And calling them "family"!

165
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,400
Yes!

166
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,320
Anyway, she's requested a private audience
on board the royal yacht

167
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,720
for what the palace is calling

168
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,640
"a frank conversation
about the way forward in South Africa."

169
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,720
Spare me!

170
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,440
I'll give her a frank conversation
about not wasting my time.

171
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Oh, excuse the eggs, boys.

172
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,080
Right. Who wants kedgeree?

173
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,960
It's not my best, I'm afraid.

174
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,880
<i>For the dinner,
this sunshine chiffon…</i>

175
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,840
There you go.

176
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,680
<i>…to pick out the yellow
in the flag of the Commonwealth.</i>

177
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,600
Yummy!

178
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:57,560
Oh, and a brooch given to you
by King Otumfuo Opoku Ware.

179
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,680
Is that a porcupine?

180
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,960
A symbol of courage and strength
in Ashanti culture.

181
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,480
Oh, we might need some of that.

182
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,520
- What's all this?
- CHOGM.

183
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,200
- Oh, of course.
- To what do I owe the honor?

184
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,960
I came to tell you that I've decided
to ask Edward to be my best man.

185
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,440
Not Charles?

186
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,000
No.

187
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,560
- Oh, that will raise some eyebrows.
- Good!

188
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,680
Let him see what it feels like
to be sidelined in a…

189
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,560
slimmed-down role,

190
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,160
since I gather that's what he now thinks
the future of the monarchy should be.

191
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,880
You, him, and his own precious bloodline.
To hell with the rest of us.

192
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,120
Insecure, jealous fool.

193
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,480
What's he jealous of?

194
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,160
Me! Always has been.

195
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,240
Oh, Andrew.

196
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Of me and you,

197
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,640
of our…

198
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,480
of our closeness.

199
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,280
The fact that I've fought in a real war,

200
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,960
won real medals.

201
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,600
Or the fact that I'm happier in love,
more popular.

202
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,080
And…

203
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,880
like other second sons I could mention,
I'd so obviously be better at it than him.

204
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,960
At what?

205
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Being the heir.

206
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,000
I just want to see you all happy.

207
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,320
There are two families I care about.

208
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,200
My own family
and the Commonwealth family of nations.

209
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,520
Keeping them all together
is my life's work. Now I must get on.

210
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,400
Mummy.

211
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,280
For the state breakfast,

212
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,520
a dress of the palest blue
and gold brocade…

213
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,440
Sarah!

214
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,760
…will go very well
with the diamond necklace given to you

215
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,640
by the people of South Africa
on your 21st birthday.

216
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,720
Lovely.

217
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,920
I told her.
She was fine with it. Edward it is.

218
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,240
Aren't you, now.

219
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,480
Right, let's go.

220
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,920
Your Majesty.
I just included that sentence there.

221
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,560
I don't think that's necessary.

222
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,760
- No, I liked it before.
- We'll change it back.

223
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,080
Your Majesty. Thank you for coming.

224
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,560
Oh, thank you.
They're lovely. Thank you very much.

225
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,760
Those of you who know me

226
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:36,240
will be aware
that the Commonwealth of Nations

227
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,200
is a second family to me,

228
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,880
as it was to my late father,

229
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,560
King George VI.

230
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,360
There are always tensions between nations.

231
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,040
Global peace is fragile.

232
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:56,160
But I believe this union offers us all
something rare and valuable.

233
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,280
The capacity to celebrate difference.

234
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,880
To value compromise over conflict.

235
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:12,640
And to find a way to heal divisions
in the interests of peace and goodwill.

236
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,640
Thank you.

237
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,760
Attention!

238
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,160
Prime Minister.

239
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,480
The prime minister, Your Majesty.

240
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,240
Your Majesty.

241
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,880
It was kind of you to come.
I won't keep you long.

242
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,640
Um, I was hoping
we could briefly discuss South Africa.

243
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,720
Ma'am.

244
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,640
It is my fervent hope
that Britain will join

245
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,800
the other countries of the Commonwealth
and impose sanctions

246
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,720
on an apartheid regime
that has no place in the modern world.

247
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,840
Let us be quite clear about this.

248
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,120
Nothing useful
can be achieved by sanctions.

249
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,400
Really? It was my understanding they would
devastate the South African government.

250
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,520
They would devastate us too.

251
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,600
Trade between our two countries
is worth three billion pounds a year.

252
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,000
Might we look at it
from the South African point of view?

253
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,760
I am, ma'am.

254
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,560
South Africa is already
a disinvestment economy.

255
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:39,320
But Black South Africans want sanctions,
so shouldn't we listen to them?

256
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,720
Black South Africans
don't want to inherit a wasteland.

257
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,040
They will if they feel
it is <i>their </i>wasteland.

258
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,640
President Kaunda of Zambia
would confirm as much.

259
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,760
It is not the business
of a British prime minister

260
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,240
to consult with unelected dictators.

261
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,880
But it is a sovereign's duty
when they are part of the Commonwealth.

262
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,400
Yes.

263
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,440
The Commonwealth.

264
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,000
Yes, the Commonwealth.

265
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,880
I recognize that for your family,

266
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,960
the transition of this nation

267
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:15,960
from empire to comparative supplicancy
on the world stage

268
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,400
must have come as a greater shock
than to the rest of us.

269
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:25,560
But I would argue that the Commonwealth
is not the way to fill that gap.

270
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,720
There <i>are </i>ways
of Britain being great again,

271
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,800
and that is through a revitalized economy,

272
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:36,640
not through association
with unreliable tribal leaders

273
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,240
in eccentric costumes.

274
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,240
But isn't that all I am, Prime Minister?

275
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,280
A tribal leader in eccentric costume?

276
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,680
Certainly not.

277
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,960
You're head of an evolved
constitutional monarchy

278
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,040
that stretches back
to William the Conqueror.

279
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,880
It's not comparing like with like.

280
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,840
Ah, now that's where we differ.

281
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,440
You see,
I consider myself to be exactly like them.

282
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,000
To me, Ghana, Zambia, Malawi

283
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,760
are all great sovereign nations
with great histories.

284
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,080
I am aware
you probably don't share that view.

285
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,280
To you, the Commonwealth
is something of a distraction,

286
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,440
a waste of time.

287
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,840
But in many ways,
I have given my life to it.

288
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,560
It was the pledge I made 40 years ago.

289
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,680
On the wireless?

290
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,720
"To our great imperial family…"

291
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,480
I remember listening to it

292
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,560
as a student at Oxford.

293
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,000
But we cannot let the values of the past

294
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,560
distract us
from the realities of the present,

295
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:40,080
particularly where Britain's
economic interests are concerned.

296
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,920
Forty-eight countries of the Commonwealth
are now preparing a statement

297
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,520
condemning the South African regime
and recommending tougher sanctions.

298
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,600
What they…

299
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,400
What<i> I </i>would like you to do
is sign that statement.

300
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,760
If I didn't know better,

301
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,960
that sounded very much like a directive.

302
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,760
Think of it as a question.

303
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,120
<i>The jolly atmosphere at the opening
of the Commonwealth conference in Nassau,</i>

304
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,360
<i>nicknamed the CHOGM, fooled nobody.</i>

305
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,680
<i>Within an hour, South Africa came up</i>

306
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:20,000
<i>with the Indian prime minister
making his position crystal clear.</i>

307
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,720
How was it?

308
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,480
My meeting with the Queen?
It was a little testy.

309
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,160
Although I must say, I do like the boat.

310
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,240
Yacht.

311
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,160
<i>It isn't a yacht.</i>

312
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,960
It's a great big ship.

313
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,640
And when the sovereign sails in it,
historically it's called a yacht.

314
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,720
Oh, don't be a know-all. It's unbecoming.

315
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,440
Why was it frosty?

316
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,720
I didn't say "frosty." I said "testy."

317
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:49,280
Although I wish it had been frosty.
It's far too hot here.

318
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,920
Because my fellow heads of government
are now coming up with a statement

319
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,240
condemning the South African government
they want me to sign.

320
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,200
I've told them I won't accept anything
with the word "sanction,"

321
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,720
and… they've started...

322
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,640
Getting their knickers in a twist?

323
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,280
Insisting they won't accept anything less.

324
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:16,280
So now we need to come up with a word
that… works for everyone.

325
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,640
Well, good luck with that.

326
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,080
Thank you, DT.

327
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,840
No, no, no, no.

328
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,040
She rejected any mention of "proposals."

329
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,480
I'm determined
to win this battle, Sonny.

330
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,960
I don't often get into a fight,
but when I do, I want to win.

331
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,200
You will, ma'am.

332
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,360
Remember, you are not alone.

333
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,960
It is 48 against one.

334
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,680
We are going back with another word.

335
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,680
"Measures…"

336
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,920
No, no, no.

337
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,920
No.

338
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,880
I'm sorry.

339
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,160
A no to "measures."

340
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,280
Yes, so we are going back with "actions."

341
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,640
And should that fail?

342
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,200
We still have "controls."

343
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,000
Yes, I'm beginning to see
this is all about control.

344
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,200
No. No.

345
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,480
No. No, no, no.

346
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,920
No.

347
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,440
Thank you.

348
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,040
They must be out of their minds.

349
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,840
No. No! No…

350
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,640
Definitely not.

351
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,720
No!

352
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,240
Ridiculous.

353
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,560
What we need here
is not useless politicians… Sorry, Sonny.

354
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,640
…but a writer.

355
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,520
Where might we find one?

356
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,160
<i>…sanctions…</i>

357
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,680
<i>…restrictions…</i>

358
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,200
<i>…protocols…</i>

359
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,280
<i>…measures…</i>

360
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,240
<i>…proposals…</i>

361
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,360
<i>…curbs…</i>

362
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,080
<i>…gestures…</i>

363
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,040
<i>…expediences…</i>

364
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,560
<i>…signals…</i>

365
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,440
Hmm.

366
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,280
Yes, I think we can work with that.

367
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,360
"Signals"!

368
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,920
Yes, she agreed to "signals."

369
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
And among the signals she agreed to

370
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:18,400
are actually several of the sanctions
she would never have contemplated

371
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,920
had they been called sanctions.

372
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,400
Oh, thank you, Michael.
And congratulations.

373
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,760
- Have we won?
- Oh yes.

374
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,160
It's a victory for the Commonwealth,
for humanity, a victory for you.

375
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,840
When put in the ring with her Queen,
the Iron Lady melted.

376
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,480
Oh.

377
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,640
Well played, Margaret.
A victory for common sense.

378
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,440
Whatever are you talking about?

379
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,480
The other heads of government
will appreciate

380
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,400
your willingness to seek a compromise.

381
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,200
There's a reason the top job
has always eluded you, Geoffrey.

382
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,120
The absence of the killer instinct.

383
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:21,680
…that our family is once more
united around a common consensus.

384
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,080
But, ladies and gentlemen,
first, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

385
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,800
- Prime Minister.
- Yes?

386
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,120
You have been forced
to make significant concessions.

387
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,480
Not that I noticed.

388
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:37,080
You signed a document
prepared by 48 countries

389
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,840
who were in conflict with you.

390
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,200
I did.

391
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,240
But the question is,

392
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,200
did one person move to the 48,

393
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,440
or did 48 move to one?

394
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,520
Yes, I agreed to "signals."

395
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,640
But as you know,

396
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,800
with one simple turn,

397
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,480
a signal can soon point

398
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:06,160
in an entirely different direction.
Thank you.

399
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,320
- Prime Minister!
- Prime Minister!

400
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,520
Secretary-General,
are you giving out a statement now?

401
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,200
Where does that leave the Commonwealth?

402
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,440
- That's what she said?
- Yes, ma'am.

403
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,280
- Before walking off.
- Really?

404
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,600
Ready? Here we go.

405
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,960
Please. We're ready.

406
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,720
In position.

407
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,520
Perfect.

408
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,240
Look at me.

409
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,680
Three, two, one…

00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,520

418
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,400
Some early reactions have come in,
and so far, very encouraging.

419
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,520
Right.

420
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,560
But, uh…

421
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,400
no offers yet?

422
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,720
Oh, uh…

423
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:36,680
Not yet. But, regardless
of whether we get this one published,

424
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:41,400
what is undeniable
is that you write vividly, catchily…

425
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,760
Dare I say it?

426
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,600
…even commercially.

427
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:49,840
Well, it's not a dirty word, Michael.
You can really tell a story.

428
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,160
I am wondering,

429
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,480
have you ever considered
a political thriller?

430
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,400
What?

431
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,600
The inner workings of Whitehall,
Westminster, the palace.

432
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,120
No one could write it better than you.

433
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,200
No.

434
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,920
No. If this magnum opus doesn't work,
I'll call it a day.

435
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,880
You could expose it all
under an assumed name.

436
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,480
Mmm. I could.

437
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,200
But, sadly, I'm old-fashioned
and would never betray those confidences

438
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,280
or the people I'm proud to serve.

439
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,600
- I had to try.
- Hmm.

440
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,600
Was that very grubby of me?

441
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,160
Mmm.

442
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,640
Not grubby.

443
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,600
Just quietly heartbreaking.

444
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,440
<i>With violence
escalating in South Africa,</i>

445
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,440
<i>tensions between the United Kingdom
and other nations of the Commonwealth</i>

446
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,080
<i>are at breaking point.</i>

447
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,360
<i>Mrs. Thatcher's refusal
to act on sanctions</i>

448
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,000
<i>being blamed for the collapse
of the Commonwealth Games…</i>

449
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,080
Good meeting?

450
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,680
Great, thank you.

451
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,080
Hate to dampen the mood,
but the <i>Today </i>newspaper has let us know

452
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:58,000
they are now running a front-page story
about the increasingly sour relations

453
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,680
between Buckingham Palace
and Downing Street

454
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,120
following the recent crisis

455
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,600
at the Commonwealth
Heads of Government Meeting.

456
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,600
- What is it with these people?
<i>- </i>Tea, sir.

457
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:12,480
And that relations between the two women
are in danger of completely breaking down.

458
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,080
The good news is, it's <i>Today,</i>

459
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,800
so we can expect it to have little impact.

460
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,160
The bad news is,

461
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,640
it won't be long before bigger,
more influential newspapers

462
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,960
realize this warrants further scrutiny.

463
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,120
So I think the time might have come

464
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,960
for Your Majesty
to make some kind of preemptive statement.

465
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,560
Uh, what kind of statement?

466
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,080
One of support,

467
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,680
even, dare I say…

468
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,280
personal affection for the prime minister.

469
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,680
About the job she's doing,

470
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,720
something that would kill the gossip
stone-dead.

471
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,760
What if I'm not happy
with the job she's doing?

472
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,960
What if I'd be happy for people to know
the displeasure was actually real?

473
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,800
That I <i>am</i> personally concerned
about her lack of compassion.

474
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:05,040
You know how seriously I take
my constitutional responsibility

475
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,160
to remain silent,
but each of us has our line in the sand.

476
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,000
If it were to become public knowledge

477
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,680
that there had been an unprecedented rift
between sovereign and prime minister,

478
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,200
would that really be so bad?

479
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,320
Well…

480
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,480
Um…

481
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,400
If… if that really were your intention…

482
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,520
And for the record, ma'am, I must say
I think that would be a misjudgment.

483
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:41,040
And risk doing
serious and irreparable harm

484
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,040
to the relationship between
Buckingham Palace and Downing Street.

485
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,280
…then <i>Today </i>would not be
the newspaper I would go to.

486
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,840
I'd go somewhere with more heft,

487
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,760
somewhere that also had a clear sense

488
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:08,720
of the unprecedented nature of this, where
they understood the rules of the game.

489
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,640
Can I leave that with you, Michael?
You are the expert.

490
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,960
- Ma'am.
- Ma'am.

491
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,320
It's reckless.

492
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,560
- It's reckless, Martin, and irresponsible.
- I'm as surprised as you are.

493
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,520
It goes against my professional advice,

494
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,320
and I want my objection noted.

495
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,120
Noted?

496
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,920
Noted, Martin.

497
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,160
It's noted.

498
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,720
- It...
- It's noted.

499
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,160
Simon Freeman of the <i>Sunday Times</i>
is on the line.

500
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,840
He's rung three times.

501
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,960
Following up on rumors about

502
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:11,360
"a deep and irreconcilable rift
between the Queen and Mrs. Thatcher."

503
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,520
All right.

504
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,040
Put him through.

505
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,720
- Six quid fifty-four, sir.
- Yeah. Keep the change.

506
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,200
- Thank you.
- Prime Minister.

507
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,560
- Evening, Prime Minister.
- Evening, Bernard.

508
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,720
I've just had a call from the <i>Sunday Times</i>

509
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,200
letting us know that there will be
a difficult piece in the paper tomorrow.

510
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,120
About what?

511
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,640
The fault lines that have developed

512
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,160
in the relationship
between sovereign and prime minister.

513
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,680
What?

514
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,080

Here.

520
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,840
<i>A constitutional crisis

521
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:39,000

00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,760
<i>over Mrs. Thatcher's failure
to commit to a policy of sanctions</i>

528
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,120
<i>against apartheid in South Africa…</i>

529
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,080
Christ!

530
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:04,320
<i>…a position regarding which the Queen
has apparently expressed her disapproval,</i>

531
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,520
<i>marking a distinct break
with the monarch's long-held practice</i>

532
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,200
<i>of never passing comment
on political affairs.</i>

533
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,240
<i>So far, Buckingham Palace has refused
to be drawn on the veracity of the report</i>

534
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,600
<i>with the palace spokesman
declining to comment</i>

535
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,000
<i>on an article entitled…</i>

536
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:22,160
"The African Queen.
At odds with Number 10."

537
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,840
"It has been an eventful week
for Buckingham Palace."

538
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:29,760
"Queen Elizabeth II,
a well-intentioned, apolitical figurehead,

539
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,720
has been dragged into a messy row
over South Africa

540
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:37,200
because of the stubbornness
and insensitivity…"

541
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,680
"…of her prime minister.

542
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:43,640
Far from being a straightforward,
uncomplicated countrywoman…"

543
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,240
"…a late-middle-aged grandmother,

544
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,080
who is most at ease
when talking about dogs and horses…"

545
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,680
"…she has shown that
she is also an astute political infighter

546
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,240
who is quite prepared
to take on Downing Street…"

547
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,680
"…when provoked."

548
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,560
Really?

549
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,520
Well, that's what it says.

550
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,240
I'm feeling something
for the very first time.

551
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,200
- Something which I never imagined feeling.
- What is that?

552
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,360
Impatience for our next audience.

553
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,720
- There she is!
- Mrs. Thatcher!

554
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,400
Over here!

555
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,800
<i>Buckingham Palace
has continued to deny accusations</i>

556
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,320
<i>published in the </i>Sunday Times

557
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,080
<i>regarding the rift
between the Queen and Downing Street.</i>

558
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,800
<i>Government sources claim
that the sacrosanct relationship</i>

559
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:44,760
<i>between sovereign and first minister
was in danger of being blown apart.</i>

560
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,720
The prime minister's here.

561
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,840
Your Majesty.

562
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,920
Prime Minister.

563
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,640
Before coming today,

564
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,640
I checked with the cabinet secretary,

565
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:29,320
and it turns out that in the seven years
I have been prime minister,

566
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,680
we have had 164 audiences,

567
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:37,920
always the model of cordiality,
productivity, and mutual respect.

568
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,520
So it is perhaps not unreasonable

569
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,720
to expect an isolated hiccup.

570
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,680
What hiccup?

571
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,000
I was under the impression

572
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:51,200
that Her Majesty <i>never </i>expressed
her political views in public.

573
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,520
I don't.

574
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,320
That there was
an unbreakable code of silence

575
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,320
between sovereign and first minister.

576
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,240
If you're referring to the <i>Sunday Times,</i>

577
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,400
I've always advised my prime ministers
against reading the newspapers.

578
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,720
I <i>don't, </i>ma'am.

579
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,720
They misunderstand, misquote,

580
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,280
and misrepresent.
Then everybody gets into a fluster.

581
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,360
But my press secretary does,

582
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,720
and he has working relationships
with all of the editors,

583
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,240
and the editor in this case assured him
that the sources were unimpeachable.

584
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,200
Close to the Queen.

585
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,600
Unprecedentedly close.

586
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,920
Well, I'm sure a clarification
will soon be forthcoming.

587
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,280
In the meantime, should we make a start
on the business of the week?

588
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,000
Only I am mindful of the time.

589
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,720
This <i>is </i>the business, ma'am.

590
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,520
The <i>only </i>business.

591
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,440
I think we have enough respect
for one another personally

592
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,080
to ask ourselves
some of the bigger questions,

593
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,440
woman to woman.

594
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,760
We are the same age, after all.

595
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,160
Really?

596
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,000
Just six months between us.

597
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,040
Oh? And who is the senior?

598
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,840
I am… ma'am.

599
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,480
"Uncaring,

600
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:16,600
confrontational, and socially divisive."

601
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:20,200
That's how these sources
so close to the Queen describe me.

602
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,760
- Prime Minister...
- That I lack compassion.

603
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:26,920
And that my government
has done irretrievable damage

604
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,560
to the country's social fabric.

605
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:40,560
My responsibility,
for the time I have in office,

606
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,160
is to put sentimentality to one side

607
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,960
and look after this country's interests

608
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,240
with the perspective
of a cold balance sheet.

609
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,520
And while I greatly admire
your sense of fairness

610
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,200
and compassion
for those less fortunate than us…

611
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,480
Do you? Really?

612
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,800
…let us not forget

613
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,360
that of the two of us,

614
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:08,520
<i>I</i> am the one from a small street
in an irrelevant town

615
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,360
with a father
who could not bequeath me a title

616
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,600
or a Commonwealth, but only grit,

617
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,360
good sense, and determination.

618
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:22,280
And I don't want people's pity
or charity or compassion.

619
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,240
Nothing would insult me more.

620
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,800
My goal…

621
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:33,320
is to change this country
from being dependent to self-reliant,

622
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,000
and I think in that, I am succeeding.

623
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,680
I have had to learn
many difficult lessons as sovereign...

624
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,920
Britons are learning
to look after number one,

625
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,160
to get ahead,

626
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,800
and only then,

627
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,920
if they choose,

628
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,640
to look after their neighbor.

629
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,560
Of those...

630
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,440
No one would remember the Good Samaritan

631
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:58,360
if he only had good intentions.

632
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,440
You see,

633
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:03,200
he had money as well.

634
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,480
…perhaps the hardest

635
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,880
is that I am obliged
to support my prime ministers

636
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,560
on any position they take,

637
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:13,520
even yours,
regarding sanctions against South Africa.

638
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,040
My question is,

639
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:21,800
given the lack of impact it has
on your day-to-day political fortunes,

640
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,000
yet how important it is to me…

641
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,720
…could you not have
supported <i>me</i> just once?

642
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,480
My fellow Commonwealth leaders,

643
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,840
many of whom I consider to be friends,

644
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:38,280
now feel that I have betrayed them
on an issue most important to them.

645
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:41,480
Well, they need only
read the <i>Sunday Times.</i>

646
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,480
It will give them no doubt
as to your position.

647
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,960
Oh look, our time is up.

648
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,680
How it flies.

649
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,880
You must be very much
looking forward to the wedding tomorrow

650
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,240
of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson.

651
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,640
Yes, we are.

652
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,400
They seem like a good match.

653
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,480
Yes, we think so.

654
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:15,480
My own son, Mark, recently announced
that he would be getting married.

655
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,160
Your favorite? The explorer?

656
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,720
Not an explorer, ma'am.

657
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,440
That was just the once.

658
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,080
He's a businessman now.

659
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,680
In the Middle East, mostly.

660
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,960
And South Africa.

661
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,160
Of course.

662
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,880
Your Majesty.

663
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,880
<i>Listen to me carefully.
There is no story here.</i>

664
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,920
There's not a shred of truth
to these rumors.

665
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,360
The Queen continues
to have an extremely cordial

666
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,040
and productive working relationship
with the prime minister.

667
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,400
<i>The </i>Sunday Times <i>maintains</i>

668
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:59,440
<i>that the story came from
a highly placed source within the palace.</i>

669
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,960
<i>That's the line we're running with.</i>

670
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,040
We will deny it,
and you will look like fools.

671
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,640
<i>Spare me the indignation.</i>

672
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,920
<i>I understand you have to say it,
but we both know that it's true,</i>

673
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,760
<i>and your continual denial
is making you lot look like fools.</i>

674
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,520
Hello?
Can I take your details?

675
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:24,120
What's all this? Don't tell me
the groom's having last-minute doubts.

676
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:28,480
No. Andrew's asked us all to come together
because he wants someone to explain why...

677
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,640
What in God's name
is going on with our mother?

678
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,080
The wedding of the Duke of York
should be a landmark event,

679
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,680
at home and abroad.

680
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,760
Instead,

681
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,920
thanks to the Queen's
inexplicable lapse of judgment,

682
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,720
the newspapers are full
not of Sarah and me,

683
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,400
but of Mummy's rift
with the prime minister!

684
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,480
Ah, yes. The <i>Sunday Times.</i>

685
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,600
- She has made a godawful mess of it.
- What was she thinking?

686
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,840
She did what she's spent her life
telling me I cannot do.

687
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,760
She opened her mouth
and expressed an opinion.

688
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,320
And is being slaughtered for it.

689
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,120
Bloody thoughtless of her if you ask me.

690
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:11,080
You can hardly blame the newspapers
for wanting to write about something

691
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:14,480
other than the wedding of a fringe member
of the family who'll never be king.

692
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Ouch!

693
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,960
Well, it's true, isn't it?

694
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,320
Fourth in line now,

695
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,720
and by the time William's had children,
and his children have had children…

696
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,480
Fringe.

697
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,800
Shall we?

698
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,640
Did he really just say that?

699
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:41,840
On my wedding day?

700
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,480
That was impressively cunty.

701
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,480
<i>It would be hard to imagine
there'd be anything</i>

702
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:01,040
<i>that could knock a royal wedding
into second place on the news.</i>

703
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,520
<i>But the continuing escalation</i>

704
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,000
<i>of the row
between the Queen and Mrs. Thatcher</i>

705
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,280
<i>threatens to overshadow the nuptials.</i>

706
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,640
<i>The Queen has made
a very serious error of judgment,</i>

707
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,880
<i>and this </i>Sunday Times <i>article
has lit a touch paper</i>

708
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,440
<i>to what could very quickly become
a major constitutional crisis.</i>

709
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,680
<i>What the palace was hoping
to achieve by this is hard to say,</i>

710
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:26,240
<i>but the fact is,
they've stirred up a hornet's nest,</i>

711
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:31,320
<i>and so far seem to lack the wit
to avoid getting stung. This story…</i>

712
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,960
If I might interrupt, ma'am?

713
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,360
One unfortunate consequence
of our denial of the story

714
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:43,080
is that the editor of the <i>Sunday Times</i>
has now come out all guns blazing<i>,</i>

715
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:45,400
and whilst we could continue to deny it,

716
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:49,280
my own view is
that it's no longer to our advantage.

717
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:53,480
And I think we're now
going to have to give them something.

718
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,080
What?

719
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,160
A culprit.

720
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:01,600
To deflect blame from you
and to put these flames out ASAP.

721
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,640
We need to let them have a name.

722
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,280
Martin!

723
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:18,600
Michael.

724
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:21,880
Uh…

725
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,120
This… escalating situation

726
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,520
between Buckingham Palace
and Downing Street…

727
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,240
- You can't say I didn't warn you.
- Eh.

728
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,200
I think you know how seriously
the Queen takes her responsibility

729
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:37,760
and how much she values the close
relationship between the two houses.

730
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:38,840
Of course.

731
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,600
And… to see it…

732
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,960
well, compromised like this

733
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,880
as a consequence of your actions…

734
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:48,960
Wha...

735
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,440
What?

736
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:57,240
The fact is that the steps you took
were completely unprofessional.

737
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,240
Martin, stop it.

738
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:02,320
Impugning the integrity of the palace
and of the Queen herself.

739
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,160
We know one another too well.

740
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:06,520
This is madness.

741
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,480
I hope we can rely on you…

742
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:12,720
to do the right thing.

743
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:28,400
Of course.

744
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:53,760
Michael.

745
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:08,520
<i>"There is a motto which
has been borne by many of my ancestors.</i>

746
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,520
<i>A noble motto.</i>

747
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:12,840
<i>'I serve.'</i>

748
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:16,000
<i>I should like to make that dedication now.</i>

749
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:17,840
<i>It's very simple.</i>

750
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,240
<i>I declare before you all</i>

751
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,400
<i>that my whole life…</i>

752
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,520
<i>whether it be long or short,</i>

753
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,240
<i>shall be devoted to your service</i>

754
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:32,000
<i>and the service
of our great imperial family</i>

755
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,080
<i>to which we all belong.</i>

756
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,240

757
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,960
