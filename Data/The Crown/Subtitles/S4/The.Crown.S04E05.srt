1
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,480
<i>Finally, from London, under the heading
"Is Nobody Safe Anymore?"</i>

2
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,880
<i>a royal ruckus has started over the man
who had an audience with Queen Elizabeth,</i>

3
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,480
<i>uninvited and unannounced,</i>

4
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,920
<i>in the Queen's bedroom
in the middle of the night.</i>

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,320
<i>The man had cut himself on a broken window</i>

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,680
<i>and left bloodstains on the Queen's bed.</i>

7
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,400
Yesterday's intruder
was able to get through

8
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,240
an elaborate system of electronic alarms,

9
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,040
as well as past palace guards and police.

10
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,080
<i>The man was identified
as 30-year-old Michael Fagan.</i>

11
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,000
<i>A police investigation indicates
that Fagan climbed over a fence</i>

12
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,880
<i>into the 51-acre palace grounds
during the night.</i>

13
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,720
<i>He then reportedly climbed a drainpipe</i>

14
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,720
<i>and entered the royal quarters
through a window.</i>

15
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,960
<i>…and made his way
to the Queen's private bedroom</i>

16
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,360
<i>on the first floor.</i>

17
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,040
<i>For ten minutes, he sat talking
six feet away from the Queen.</i>

18
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,280
<i>Then he asked her for a cigarette.</i>

19
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,920
<i>According to his mother,
he spoke of a girlfriend called Elizabeth</i>

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,600
<i>living in SW1.</i>

21
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,120
<i>The incident
has shocked Britain and resulted</i>

22
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,640
<i>in a Scotland Yard investigation
of royal security.</i>

23
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,440
<i>Mrs. Thatcher made an urgent
return to the House of Commons today</i>

24
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,520
<i>ahead of a statement
from the home secretary.</i>

25
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,160
<i>The House will admire the calm way</i>

26
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,400
<i>in which Her Majesty responded
to what occurred.</i>

27
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,560
<i>The Queen
has carried on performing her duties</i>

28
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,440
<i>seemingly unperturbed, despite
the unprecedented and severe level</i>

29
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,520
<i>of threat that the intruder posed.</i>

30
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,560
<i>The incident left royal commentators
asking two questions.</i>

31
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,720
<i>"How on earth did he get in?"</i>

32
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,200
<i>and "What did they talk about?"</i>

33
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,280
<i>Mrs. Thatcher says</i>

34
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,360
<i>her government has a coherent
political agenda for many years ahead</i>

35
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,520
<i>to complete the transformation of Britain.</i>

36
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,120
<i>I'm saying that background,
where you come from, doesn't matter.</i>

37
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,760
<i>Because if you can prove yourself
to be of value to the economy,</i>

38
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,200
<i>if you can contribute,</i>

39
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,000
<i>if you can increase your own prosperity
for the good of others…</i>

40
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,896
- Oh, fuck off!
<i>- …then, jolly good luck to you.</i>

41
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,440
Fuck off. Fuck off!

42
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,320
<i>…go-getters who will create jobs,</i>

43
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,040
<i>the successful people,</i>

44
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,400
<i>the people who can show
they are determined to get ahead.</i>

45
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,960
<i>The prime minister's
stated goal is to reinvigorate the nation…</i>

46
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,600
<i>More travel and news after this.</i>

47
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,280

- Me again.
- Name?

63
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,040
Michael Fagan.

64
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,120
Any work in the past two weeks?

65
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,120
Every fortnight, I come here,

66
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,960
and every fortnight,
you ask me the same question.

67
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,160
Any work in the past two weeks?

68
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,800
I chaired the Olympic Committee,

69
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,840
then I did a few days

70
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,080
as secretary-general
of the United Nations.

71
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,920
Next.

72
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,920
Have you had any work
in the last two weeks?

73
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
What am I supposed to live on?
Fresh air?

74
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,040
- All right, take care.
- Catch you later.

75
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,400
We'll just bring the whole van,
we might as well.

76
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,400
Bill!

77
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,560
Hello, mate. How you doing?

78
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,080
- All right. You?
- Yeah, not bad.

79
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,800
Yeah. Have you still got that mate,
the, uh…

80
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,400
whatsit, the cash-in-hand fella?

81
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,640
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
You looking for some work?

82
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,760
Whatever you have, I will take.

83
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,680
Whose brushes are these?

84
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,960
- They're anyone's. Just use 'em.
- Here he is!

85
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,320
All right, lads.
Let's get on with it. Sooner we finish,

86
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,976
- sooner we're in the pub.
- Cheers.

87
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,440
Twenty-eight beige. Twenty-eight beige.

88
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,080
Twenty-eight beige.

89
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,760
The color of my life.

90
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,360
I might just have
a glass of white wine.

91
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,080
- Hello!
- Hello, you all right?

92
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,320
What can I get ya?

93
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,600
What's the matter?

94
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,760
Michael's here.

95
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,920
Where?

96
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,800
Stay here.

97
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,041
What are you doing?
I told you never to come here.

98
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,960
- I need to talk to you about the flat.
- Not tonight, Michael.

99
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,120
How are the kids?

100
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,240
They're fine. Now go.

101
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,920
Who's that twat?

102
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,240
- Don't be rude.
- Who is he?

103
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,320
Someone who works for a living
and looks after your kids.

104
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,320
- Now go.
- He's a fucking twat.

105
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,440
You're a fucking twat!

106
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,320
- Michael, don't start.
- D'you want some?

107
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,680
- Maybe I do!
- Yeah?

108
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,216
- Please.
- Maybe you're not worth it.

109
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,240
Well,
maybe you haven't got any balls!

110
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,000
- Michael!
- No bollocks... Shut up!

111
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,200
Fucking balls? I've got balls.

112
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,680
Let me tell you something else.
She… She knows all about my balls.

113
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,600
That's enough
out of you, all right?

114
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,816
- Fucking do it!
- Don't start!

115
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,840
- Fucking come on and do it, then!
- Fucking go on, then!

116
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Fucking do it, then! Fucking do it!

117
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,080
Wait! Michael, just go, will ya?

118
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,160
Who's looking after your fucking kids?

119
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,880
- You fucking twat!
- Just stop it!

120
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,160
Fucking do it, then!
Don't fucking know me, do ya?

121
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,880

129
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,880
Prime Minister.

130
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,680
I am very happy to say

131
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,920
that after the recapture
of South Georgia last week,

132
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,800
our forces have now escalated operations.

133
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,200
An RAF Vulcan
and accompanying support plane

134
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,880
have successfully carried out
bombing raids near the capital.

135
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,800
Any casualties?

136
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,720
None.

137
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,760
Enemy forces attempted to mount
a counterattack,

138
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,840
but one Argentine Canberra and one Mirage

139
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,120
were successfully shot down
by our Harriers.

140
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,040
I think we can confidently say
the tide has turned,

141
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:18,440
and the recapture of the Falkland Islands
is within reach.

142
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,120
The prime minister came to see me today.

143
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,920
- I hope you rolled out the red carpet.
- Why would I do that?

144
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,160
Everyone was against us
going to the Falklands,

145
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,840
but she believed we could pull it off,
and now victory's within sight.

146
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,920
<i>Her </i>victory.

147
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,760
She's finally doing what we've been
waiting years for someone to do.

148
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,840
Which is?

149
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,200
Lead this country firmly and decisively

150
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,440
after years of incompetence
and mismanagement.

151
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,960
She brought up the subject
of palace security again,

152
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,080
which infuriated me.

153
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,160
Why?

154
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,400
Do you want our walls
to be built even higher?

155
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,840
Or the public to stand ten feet
further back at engagements?

156
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,520
I take pleasure in meeting
members of the public

157
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,320
and have learnt so much from them.

158
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,640
You remember
the lesson Lord Altrincham taught us.

159
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,000
Twenty-five years ago, we were given
the advice to be more transparent.

160
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,120
Accessible.

161
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,480
To lower the drawbridge.

162
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,240
It doesn't feel right
to be pulling it up again.

163
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,800
Right. Gloves on.

164
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,320
We've identified and prepared

165
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,240
a few suitable members
of the general public for you to meet.

166
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,480
Mm-hmm. But no questions,
no actual conversation?

167
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,120
- No, ma'am.
- Right, let's get this over with.

168
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,760
I present Mr. and Mrs. Barrowclough,
ma'am.

169
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,560
- Hello.
- Your Majesty.

170
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,840
- What do you do?
- Health and safety officer.

171
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,800
I hope you don't find
many issues here today.

172
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,880
No, not at all.

173
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,400
Will you be in on Thursday?

174
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,400
Mrs. Wallace, vice president
of the Women's Institute…

175
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,200
Hello.
Do you still find time to bake cakes?

176
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,440
Oh yes!

177
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,376
<i>I was brought up
by a Victorian grandmother.</i>

178
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,360
<i>We were taught to work jolly hard.</i>

179
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,600
<i>You were taught to improve yourself.
You were taught self-reliance.</i>

180
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,400
<i>- You were taught to live in your income.</i>
- Next.

181
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,480
<i>You were taught
that cleanliness was next to godliness.</i>

182
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,040
- Me again.
- Name?

183
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,480
Uh, Bond. James Bond.

184
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,160
Any work in the past two weeks?

185
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,480
International espionage agent, you know.

186
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,520
Intelligence work.
Counterintelligence. Assassinations.

187
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,160
Twat.

188
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,920
I've got a question for you.
Who's your boss?

189
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,240
I wanna make a complaint.

190
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,080
If you feel you've been treated unfairly,
please speak to your member of Parliament,

191
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,760
who can refer you
to the Parliamentary Ombudsman.

192
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,640
Oh…

193
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,720
Ugh…

194
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,200
You know, you're the fucking twat.

195
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,280
Next!

196
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,480
<i>While your process
with the rest of the economy</i>

197
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,160
<i>works its way through, then,</i>

198
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,440
<i>one of the consequences appears to be
very high unemployment,</i>

199
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,280
<i>unemployment which is rising.</i>

200
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,080
<i>No, it's…
Can I put it this way?</i>

201
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,840
<i>It's like a nurse
looking after an ill patient.</i>

202
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,840
<i>Which is the better nurse?</i>

203
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,800
<i>The one who smothers the patient
with sympathy,</i>

204
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,760
<i>"Never mind, dear. There, there.</i>

205
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,520
<i>You just lie back.
I'll bring you all your meals.</i>

206
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,560
<i>I'll bring your papers.
There, there. You just lie back.</i>

207
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,200
<i>I'll look after you"?</i>

208
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:40,360
<i>Or the nurse who says,
"Now come on. Just shake out of it.</i>

209
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,040
<i>I know you had an operation yesterday.</i>

210
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,720
<i>Time you put your feet to the ground
and took a few steps.</i>

211
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,640
<i>That's right, dear. That's right.</i>

212
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,040
<i>Now get back
and take a few more tomorrow"?</i>

213
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,360
<i>Which do you think is the better nurse?</i>

214
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,201
<i>I know which
sounds more like you, Mrs. Thatcher!</i>

215
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,320
<i>How can I help…</i>

216
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
<i>Mr. Fagan?</i>

217
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,880
I wanted to talk to someone
about the system.

218
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,440
Which system?

219
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,680
This system. Britain.

220
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,720
What is it about the system
that bothers you?

221
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,800
Um, it's unfair…

222
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,800
and a disgrace.

223
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:38,560
It says here you're currently unemployed.
What do you do normally?

224
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,760
I'm a painter-decorator,

225
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,920
but there's not a lot of work
around recently.

226
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,720
Perhaps because
instead of investing in new homes,

227
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,880
which I could then paint and decorate,

228
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:53,160
devil woman here is spending it all
on a completely unnecessary war.

229
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,520
I have to tell you
that I fully support the war.

230
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,560
Do you know what it costs?

231
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,840
I know precisely.
The government has published the figures.

232
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,960
Why would you spend
over three billion pounds

233
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,920
on a war against total strangers

234
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,200
rather than looking after your own family?

235
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,280
Because the invasion
of the Falkland Islands

236
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,960
was an illegal act by a foreign power,

237
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,840
because General Galtieri is a criminal
and a fascist,

238
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,920
and because the Falkland Islanders
are British subjects

239
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,160
living on British sovereign territory.

240
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,880
But thank you for your observations,

241
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,200
which I will note.

242
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,200
- No, you won't.
- Yes, I will.

243
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,120
No, you won't.

244
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,680
Noted, Mr. Fagan.

245
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,760
Do you really need
a picture of her in here?

246
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,360
It's like being in Turkey or Iraq.

247
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,560
She's my boss.

248
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,080
- <i>I'm </i>your boss. I'm a constituent.
- Did you vote for me?

249
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,000
You must be joking!

250
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,760
You'll forgive me
if I don't think of you as my boss.

251
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,520
Margaret Thatcher
is the leader of the Conservative Party,

252
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,840
to which I belong,

253
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,000
and so I think of <i>her</i> as my boss.

254
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,320
You fancy her?

255
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,640
- What?
- Have dirty thoughts? I bet you do.

256
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,560
I'm afraid that's all we have time for.

257
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,400
I haven't finished.

258
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,680
If you still wish
to register your protest,

259
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,760
I suggest you do so via the ballot box
or peacefully in the street,

260
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,320
as is your right in a civilized democracy.

261
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,440
But if I wanna talk to someone about her,
who do I speak to?

262
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,520
The leader of the opposition.

263
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,800
He has the opportunity
to put questions to her

264
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,640
in the House of Commons twice a week.

265
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,760
Failing that, the Queen.

266
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,680
She has a private audience
with the prime minister every Tuesday.

267
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,600
Why don't you drop in
at Buckingham Palace to ask her?

268
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,920
<i>Guards!</i>

269
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,200
<i>By the left,</i>

270
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,840
<i>quick march!</i>

271
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,360
Left, right, left, right…

272
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,000
Her Majesty the Queen
here, taking the royal salute,

273
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,520
the key moment in this,
the Queen's annual Birthday Parade.

274
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,320
As members of the Household Division
troop their color,

275
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,640
those watching at home, as well as
some lucky members of the public

276
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,840
invited to attend,

277
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:27,160
come together as one nation
in celebration of this joyous event.

278
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,400
<i>I don't need to tell you that I
and every minister in this government</i>

279
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,040
<i>are desperately concerned…</i>

280
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,240
Number 72. Window 2.

281
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:43,040
Application for single payment
to cover home improvements?

282
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,720
- Yep.
- Can you give me more information?

283
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,360
Okay. My wife has left me.

284
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
All right.

285
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,200
I went to see Social Services to mediate

286
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,360
'cause I want my kids
to spend time with me.

287
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,440
Right.

288
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,040
But they've seen the flat
and said it needs improving.

289
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,320
There's water damage. I wanna fix it.

290
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,040
You're not the primary tenant.

291
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,720
My wife's the primary tenant,
but she's left.

292
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,000
I just explained.

293
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,080
You'd have to be the primary tenant

294
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,800
before we could even consider
paying for the damages.

295
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,520
You tried talking to the council?

296
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,560
No. They told me to speak to you.

297
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:26,080
Look, if this doesn't get sorted,
I don't get to see my kids.

298
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,840
You're gonna have to take that up
with the council.

299
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,320
<i>…paid off a great proportion
of the foreign debts we inherited.</i>

300
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:44,960
Hey!

301
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,040
Oh…

302
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,280
Quickly! There's a man.

303
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,120
- An intruder.
- What?

304
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,720
He's by the Queen's bedroom.

305
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,760
- Come on! Hurry up!
- Turn the lights on.

306
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,840
Okay.

307
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,880
- Is this where he was spotted?
- Down the other end.

308
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,160
- Spread out!
- Check the bedroom.

309
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,880
Check under the beds. Check those windows.

310
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,600
- He might have smashed one to get in.
- Bathroom clear.

311
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,840
- Bedroom clear.
- Check the dressing room, quickly!

312
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,760
- No sign.
- Dressing room clear.

313
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,880
The evidence suggests he…
we're assuming it was a he,

314
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,400
got in over the railings
near to the Ambassadors' Entrance,

315
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,520
up a drainpipe

316
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,120
and in through a window
to the Master of the Household's office.

317
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,320
From there, he went down the East Gallery,
along the Cross Gallery,

318
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,080
through the Picture Gallery
to the gift room…

319
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,960
where he drank a bottle of wine.

320
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,400
What?

321
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,560
Uh, a Vache Johannisberg Riesling.

322
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,600
Valued at six pounds.

323
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,480
He also broke a painted vase,

324
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,520
a gift from the president of Guyana.

325
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,440
I remember that vase.

326
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,200
It's a ghastly little pink thing

327
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,560
- with little blue worms all over it.
- Yes.

328
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,880
Not worms. Those were
the three main rivers of Guyana.

329
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,800
Essequibo, Berbice, and Demerara.

330
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,720
Oh.

331
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,200
And a strange-looking duck.

332
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,920
- The national bird, the Canje pheasant.
- Right.

333
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,680
How come no one stopped him?

334
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,360
No one can explain it, ma'am.

335
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,440
It's possible that the timing
of his intrusion, around 9:00 p.m.,

336
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,640
may have aided him
in slipping through the net.

337
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,560
It also appears that
some of the palace's alarm systems

338
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,360
were malfunctioning

339
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,720
and that the window on the second floor
had been left unsecured.

340
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,440
Do we know what he wanted?

341
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:50,360
No idea, sir, as to motive or intent.
We can just count ourselves fortunate

342
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,880
that the Queen was here at Windsor
at the time.

343
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:58,440
But, uh,
when Downing Street hears about this,

344
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:03,560
I do think we will have to brace ourselves
for a thorough security review.

345
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,400
- Christ…
- Downing Street doesn't know?

346
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,560
Not yet, ma'am.

347
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,680
The matter still rests
with the Metropolitan Police's A-District,

348
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,200
but it's yet to be passed up
the chain of command to the Home Office.

349
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,040
Do they absolutely need to know?

350
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,440
Um… Not necessarily.

351
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,280
If we can overlook
the theft of the bottle of wine

352
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,000
and the destruction of the Guyanese vase.

353
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,240
Then can we say the matter is now closed?

354
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:34,080
Otherwise, the next thing you know,
Downing Street will overreact,

355
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,200
we'll have alarms, surveillance cameras,
and policemen everywhere.

356
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,280
Buckingham Palace
is too like a prison as it is.

357
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,560
Yes, ma'am.

358
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,600
- Sam, come here.
- Go on, then.

359
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,640
Big jump.

360
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,920
- Go on.
- What'd I tell you?

361
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,720
If you're going back on,
you're doing it again.

362
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,360
Not too high now.

363
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,200
Good girl.

364
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,480
Oi!

365
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,960
Chris. Chris!

366
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,520
- Take the kids. Go see your mum.
- That's my daughter.

367
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,160
- Come on, mate.
- What you doing?

368
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,040
Derek, stop it!

369
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,360
Mummy!

370
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,880
In front of your kids, eh?

371
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,920
You're scaring them.
Why are you doing this, Michael?

372
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,560
You had enough? You had enough?

373
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,760
For goodness' sake!

374
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,880
It's a playground!

375
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,080
Go home, Mike!

376
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,960
- It's all right. It's over.
- You proud of yourself?

377
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,680
Leave us alone.
We don't need you in our lives.

378
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,280
Three pounds a carton.

379
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,200
I've got Embassies, Bensons…

380
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,600
Two Bensons, mate.

381
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,040
<i>♪ Deep in the memory ♪</i>

382
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,200
<i>♪ Of what once was love ♪</i>

383
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,640
What you got, mate?

384
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:28,400
In light of the incident that occurred
at around 3:00 p.m. last Thursday,

385
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,800
a decision has been taken

386
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,040
that your children should remain
in the permanent care of their mother.

387
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,520
Furthermore,

388
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,320
it has been deemed to be
in the children's best interests

389
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,360
that you should
no longer have any contact with them.

390
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,760
Do you understand?

391
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,120
<i>Last night, our forces
reached the outskirts of Port Stanley,</i>

392
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:07,720
<i>and in response, large numbers
of Argentine forces threw down their arms.</i>

393
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:14,640
<i>The Argentines are now reported
to be flying white flags of surrender.</i>

394
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,600
<i>With Britain's victory
in the conflict now seemingly assured,</i>

395
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,800
<i>the Queen has returned
to Buckingham Palace</i>

396
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,640
<i>ahead of her regular audience
with the prime minister.</i>

397
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,880
<i>A palace spokesman said Her Majesty was…</i>

398
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:32,400

402
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:52,640
- Maggie, Maggie, Maggie!
- Oi, oi, oi!

403
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,640
- Maggie, Maggie, Maggie!
- Oi, oi, oi!

404
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,280
- Maggie, Maggie, Maggie!
- Oi, oi, oi!

405
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,920
<i>When we started out,</i>

406
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,880
<i>there were the waverers
and the faint-hearted,</i>

407
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,320
<i>the people who believed</i>

408
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:13,160
<i>we could no longer do the things
we once did. Well, they were wrong.</i>

409
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,560
- Can I get you anything else, ma'am?
- No, thank you.

410
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:19,560
<i>Britain has a newfound confidence,</i>

411
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:23,360
<i>and we will not look back.</i>

412
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,960
<i>Mrs. Thatcher was
in jubilant mood this afternoon</i>

413
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:30,000
<i>as she told MPs
that the future of the Falkland Islands</i>

414
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,840
<i>would now rest solely in British hands.</i>

415
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,920
"<i>Britain's primacy
had been reestablished," she said,</i>

416
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,440
<i>and then she issued this warning,
"Let every nation know</i>

417
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,080
<i>that where there is
British sovereign territory,</i>

418
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,600
<i>it will be well and truly defended."</i>

419
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,960
<i>The statement was met with loud applause.</i>

420
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:51,120
<i>Mrs. Thatcher has seen a dramatic surge
in her personal popularity,</i>

421
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,960
<i>according to the latest polls.</i>

422
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,120
- Morning!
- You took your time.

423
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,280
Anything to report?

424
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,560
Nah, it's a quiet night.

425
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,560
Graveyard shift, isn't it?

426
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,800
I'll see you tomorrow.

427
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,800
Morning, Bobo.

428
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
What are you doing? It's still too early.

429
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,840
All right, if you insist.

430
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,320
- Who are you?
- My name is Michael.

431
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,040
- Out! Get out!
- You have nothing to fear from me.

432
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,480
There is an armed policeman
outside this door.

433
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,600
No, there isn't.

434
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,560
Hello?

435
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,720
What do you want? If it's money...

436
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,600
I don't want money. I don't want anything.

437
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,920
I just wanna talk to you, that's all,

438
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,200
to tell you what's going on
in the country.

439
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,640
'Cause either you don't know,
or you don't care.

440
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,720
Of course I care.

441
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,400
I care very deeply indeed.
What a thing to say.

442
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,600
- Don't do that, please.
- An unkind, stupid...

443
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,040
- Don't you dare touch me! Hello? Help!
- Stop it!

444
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,200
Just… gimme a minute, will ya?

445
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,960
I'll sort myself out, I'll say
what I gotta say, and then I'll go!

446
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,280
- You don't have a cigarette handy, do ya?
- No. Filthy habit.

447
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,440
I know, I know.

448
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,240
I just thought it might be good for you
to meet someone normal

449
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,200
who can tell it to you,
you know, as it is.

450
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,760
I meet normal people all the time.

451
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,400
No, you don't.

452
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,720
Everyone you meet's on best behavior.

453
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,840
Bowing and scraping. That's not normal.

454
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,480
- And this is normal?
- It could be, if I ever calm down.

455
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,320
You're bleeding.

456
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,120
Am I? Must have cut myself.

457
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,200
Where do I, um…

458
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,440
Bathroom. That door.

459
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,960
The richest woman in the world,
but look, it's not even electric!

460
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,240
- What?
- Your toothbrush.

461
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,360
That's the thing about this place.
It's even posher than you'd think

462
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,800
and yet more rundown.

463
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,880
Rundown?

464
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,720
Oh yeah. Corridors and state rooms?

465
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,800
Shocking.

466
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,720
Chipped paint, peeling wallpaper, stains.

467
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,680
- Decorator. Can't help noticing.
- Is that what you do?

468
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,680
Painter-decorator.

469
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,560
You should hire me.

470
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,440
You might need a glazier too.

471
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,600
I broke a window this time.

472
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,200
Last time was you too?

473
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,240
- Yeah.
- What is the matter with you?

474
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,880
- This is private property.
- No, it's not. It's state property.

475
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,440
- Either way, you're trespassing.
- Which isn't a crime.

476
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,200
Not if I don't steal anything.

477
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,560
You stole a bottle of wine last time.

478
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,920
Only to work up the courage
to speak to <i>you.</i>

479
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,360
Because I've tried everything else.

480
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,800
Writing letters,

481
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,480
speaking to my MP.
Fat lot of good any of that did.

482
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,240
Mirage of democracy.

483
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,960
So I've come to you,

484
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,240
the head of state.

485
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:38,280
You're my last resort.
Someone who can actually do something.

486
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,680
What is it you'd like me to do?

487
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,480
Save us all from her.

488
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,720
- Who?
- Thatcher.

489
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,640
She's destroying the country.

490
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,000
We've got
more than three million unemployed.

491
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,200
More than at any time
since the Great Depression.

492
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,240
- Doesn't that bother you?
- Yes, it bothers me greatly.

493
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,440
But there's nothing I can do about it.

494
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,360
When you've been in my position
as long as I have,

495
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,440
you see how quickly and how often
a nation's fortunes can change.

496
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:10,000
Joblessness, recession, crises, war.

497
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,800
All these things have
a way of correcting themselves.

498
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,560
Countries bounce back. People do.

499
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,960
- Because they simply have to.
- That's what I thought.

500
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,640
That I'd bounce back.

501
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,280
And then I didn't.

502
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,000
First the work dried up,
then my confidence dried up.

503
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,160
Then…
the love in my wife's eyes dried up.

504
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,840
And then you begin to wonder,

505
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,360
you know, where's it gone?

506
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:44,040
Not just your confidence
or your happiness, but your…

507
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,920
They say
that I have mental health problems now.

508
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,640
I don't. I'm just poor.

509
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,160
- The state can help with all of this.
- What state?

510
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,960
The state has gone.

511
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,160
She's dismantled it,

512
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,360
along with the other things we thought
we could depend on growing up.

513
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:16,920
A sense of community, a sense of,
you know, obligation to one another.

514
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,280
A sense of kindness.

515
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,480
It's all disappearing.

516
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,320
I think you're exaggerating.

517
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,760
People still show kindness to one another,

518
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,920
and they still pay their taxes
to the state.

519
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,320
And she spends that money
on an unnecessary war

520
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:37,360
and declares
the feel-good factor is back again.

521
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,640
In the meantime, all the things
that really make us feel good,

522
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,640
the right to work, the right to be ill…

523
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,080
the right to be old,

524
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:50,200
the right to be frail, be human,

525
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,880
mmm, gone.

526
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,880
You may think you're off the hook,

527
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:59,120
but she's got her eye on your job, too.
You'll be out of work soon.

528
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,760
Let me assure you, Mrs. Thatcher is
an all-too-committed monarchist.

529
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,320
She has an appetite for power
which is presidential,

530
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:10,320
and in this country, a president
and a head of state cannot coexist.

531
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,320
Mark my words, she's put us out of work.
She's quietly putting you out of work.

532
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,960
Who's that?

533
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,400
That'll be my morning tea.
They come at this time.

534
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,640
Come in.

535
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,960
- Are you all right, ma'am?
- Quite all right, thank you.

536
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,840
You might ask the policeman to come in.

537
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,840
Have you come far?

538
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,600
York Way.

539
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,760
Just behind King's Cross.

540
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,840
Lovely.

541
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,560
Is it lovely?

542
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,840
No, not particularly.

543
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,520
Is there anything else
you'd like to say to me?

544
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,280
No.

545
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,400
Thank you.

546
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,680
I do hope they don't make things
too difficult for you in light of this.

547
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,400
Thank you.

548
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,760
Well, goodbye.

549
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,920
- Don't touch her.
- It's all right.

550
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,800
I shall bear in mind what you've said.

551
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,960
- Get out!
- Now perhaps that cup of tea.

552
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,080
Yes, ma'am.

553
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,080
<i>The Home Office has confirmed</i>

554
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:35,440
<i>that a man successfully breached
Buckingham Palace security</i>

555
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,920
<i>and entered the Queen's bedroom,
not once but twice.</i>

556
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
<i>An investigation
into this unprecedented failure</i>

557
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:45,440
<i>has already begun,
and more details were given this afternoon</i>

558
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,360
<i>to an incredulous House of Commons.</i>

559
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,120
<i>Is the home secretary not aware</i>

560
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:55,280
<i>that the British public is
really very shocked and staggered</i>

561
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:57,280
<i>that this event could have occurred</i>

562
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:03,400
<i>and that the home secretary's reference
to "security not being satisfactory"</i>

563
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:06,240
<i>must be the understatement of the year?</i>

564
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,560
<i>I would say that no one is likely</i>

565
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,200
<i>to have been more shocked
and staggered than I was.</i>

566
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,680
<i>I think that
what we've got to wait to hear…</i>

567
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,240
- <i>Order!
- …we've got to await Mr. Dellow's report.</i>

568
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,880
<i>On behalf of the government</i>

569
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,840
and the Metropolitan Police,

570
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,560
I am so sorry.

571
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,160
It is a national embarrassment

572
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,840
that the Queen of the United Kingdom

573
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,560
should be subjected to troublemakers
and malcontents

574
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,120
who feel at liberty to resort to violence.

575
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,600
Oh, but he wasn't violent.

576
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,720
In fact, the only person Mr. Fagan hurt
in the course of his break-in was himself.

577
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,920
And while he may be a troubled soul,

578
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:57,440
I don't think he's entirely to blame
for his troubles,

579
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,160
being a victim of unemployment,

580
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,160
which is now more than twice what it was

581
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,360
when you came into office
just three years ago.

582
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,800
If unemployment
is temporarily high, ma'am,

583
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:10,040
then it is a necessary side effect

584
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:13,520
of the medicine we are administering
to the British economy.

585
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,560
Shouldn't we be careful
that this medicine,

586
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:18,040
like some dreadful chemotherapy,

587
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:21,400
doesn't kill the very patient
it is intended to heal?

588
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:24,160
If people like Mr. Fagan are struggling,

589
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,800
do we not have a collective duty
to help them?

590
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,920
What of our moral economy?

591
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:33,760
If we are to turn this country around…

592
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,480
we really must abandon

593
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:42,240
outdated and misguided notions
of collective duty.

594
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:45,720
There are individual men and women,

595
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,800
and there are families.

596
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:52,760
Self-interested people
who are trying to better themselves.

597
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:56,480
That is the engine that fires a nation.

598
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:02,040
My father didn't have the state
to rely on should his business fail.

599
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:04,400
It was the risk of ruin

600
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:09,760
and his duty to his family
that drove him to succeed.

601
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:13,000
Perhaps not everyone is
as remarkable as your father.

602
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:14,480
Oh, you see,

603
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,960
that is where you and I differ.

604
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:21,560
I say they have it within them to be.

605
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,640
Even someone like Mr. Fagan?

606
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:29,160
Mr. Fagan is another matter.

607
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:32,760
Two different doctors
have reached the conclusion

608
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:35,280
he is suffering from
a schizophrenic illness.

609
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:39,480
If he is spared criminal prosecution
on account of his condition,

610
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:44,040
then a nice, secure mental hospital
will ensure

611
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:47,080
he will not be a danger any longer.

612
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:49,080
Now, if you will excuse me,

613
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,320
I really must go.

614
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,400
Where to?

615
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,080
To the victory parade

616
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,520
at the City of London.

617
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:59,520
A victory parade?

618
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:00,600
Yes, ma'am.

619
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:04,600
We have just won a war.

620
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:18,320
<i>Good morning from outside
the Royal Exchange in the City of London.</i>

621
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,240
<i>And on the saluting base,</i>

622
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:23,920
<i>the lord mayor
and the prime minister waving.</i>

623
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,760
<i>On the lord mayor's right,</i>

624
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,280
<i>on his left, our right,</i>

625
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:29,400
<i>is the Admiral of the Fleet,
Sir Terence Lewin.</i>

626
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:32,000
The prime minister taking the salute
instead of the sovereign.

627
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,080
Doesn't that bother you?

628
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,960
No. Can't say it does.

629
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,680
It's her moment. Let her enjoy it.

630
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:43,520
It's interesting.

631
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,600
What?

632
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,960
How much it clearly bothers you.

633
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:50,200
I think
that woman's getting ahead of herself,

634
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,200
and now all this increased security.

635
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,280
Well, she's trying to protect you.

636
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:55,360
From what?

637
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,240
From lunatics.

638
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,680
Normal people. My subjects.

639
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:00,760
Come on.

640
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,960
That man was clearly a lunatic.

641
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:05,640
And a fool.

642
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:08,160
Yes,
but in the best sense, like Lear's fool.

643
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,040
Don't get all…

644
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,280
Shakespearean with me.

645
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:17,640
<i>The Conqueror
that sunk the Argentine cruiser Belgrano</i>

646
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:21,000
<i>and thereby
shortened the naval war considerably.</i>

647
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:24,160
<i>But we're told
that the Conqueror is actually…</i>

648
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:27,440
I'm sorry
that I wasn't there to protect you.

649
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,320
I feel terrible.

650
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,600
But you're there by my side all the time

651
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:36,880
and do much more than keep me safe.

652
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:39,080
But thank you.

653
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,000
I expect Mr. Fagan is relieved
he didn't come through that window

654
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,000
and land on <i>your </i>bed.

655
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,600
Yes.

656
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,440
That would have been
a very different conversation.

657
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,800
