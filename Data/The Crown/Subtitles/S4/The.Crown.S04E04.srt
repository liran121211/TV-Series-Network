1
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And then up to…

2
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,720
Ready?

3
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,280
Ready.

4
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,240
Thank you.

5
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,280
Prime Minister.

6
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,600
<i>Prime Minister,
when you came to power,</i>

7
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,520
<i>you told me
you hated seeing Britain in decline</i>

8
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,960
and you would get the house in order.
Now, almost three years on,

9
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,200
we have inflation at 12%,
unemployment of three million,

10
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,720
and rioting and civil unrest
in several major cities.

11
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,840
It's true.

12
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,080
But there isn't a magical system

13
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,400
whereby you can just push a few buttons
and twiddle a few knobs

14
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,600
and everything will be all right.

15
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,680
Of course
I would like to reduce interest rates...

16
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,760
- Prime Minister, are you all right?
- Perfectly, thank you.

17
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,680
But to do that, we first need
to get the inflation rate down,

18
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,320
and that means to cut public spending.

19
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,400
I would like to be very much tougher,

20
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,520
but I can't go faster than Parliament
or the people will allow me.

21
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,120
I'm so sorry.

22
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,440
No.

23
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,120
- So unprofessional.
- No, not at all.

24
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,520
The very idea that the first time

25
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,920
a prime minister should break down
in this room and it be a woman.

26
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,640
It is by no means the first time
a prime minister has broken down in here.

27
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,600
Over the years, this room has been
part-office, part-drawing room,

28
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,560
part-confessional,
and part-psychologist's couch.

29
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,000
We even have paper hankies.

30
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,800
Oh.

31
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,960
Or a brandy?

32
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,640
Whiskey, if you have one.

33
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,480
Thank you.

34
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,200
It's my son, Mark.

35
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,840
You've two children, yes?

36
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,240
Yes, twins.

37
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,960
Mark and Carol.

38
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,240
Twenty-eight years old.

39
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,680
And my favorite, Mark…

40
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,680
a very special child,

41
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,240
the kind of son
any mother would dream of having…

42
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,520
has gone missing.

43
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,520
Missing?

44
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,560
He has been competing
in the Paris-Dakar car rally.

45
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,160
<i>He and his teammates
had driven through France,</i>

46
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,920
<i>crossed into Algeria</i>

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,440
<i>and into the Sahara Desert.</i>

48
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,200
- You don't know where we are, do you?
- Yes, I do. I know exactly.

49
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,280
We're, um…

50
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,840
23 kilometers, uh, east…

51
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,760
No, west of Reggarnay.

52
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,320
Regga... Reggane.

53
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,400
- We're lost.
- We're not lost.

54
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,200
I know exactly what I'm doing.

55
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,960
<i>The last sighting
was at a checkpoint</i>

56
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,040
<i>in a village in Algeria two days ago.</i>

57
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,000
<i>Since then, nothing.</i>

58
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,040
<i>It's been five days</i>

59
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,240
<i>since Mark Thatcher was last sighted
with his teammates.</i>

60
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,840
<i>Helicopters have begun to scour
the desert terrain</i>

61
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,280
<i>in which they went missing,</i>

62
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,480
<i>but with such a large…</i>

63
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,320
The prime minister said
something interesting today about her son.

64
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,680
Was it about his sense of direction?

65
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,240
She described him as her favorite child.

66
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,080
Is that interesting?

67
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,320
The way she said it was,
without equivocation or thought.

68
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,680
Who would do that?

69
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,040
Openly admit to preferring one child
to another, especially twins.

70
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,360
- Any honest parent.
- What?

71
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,320
Any honest parent
would admit to having a favorite.

72
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,920
Who's our favorite?

73
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,800
- My favorite or your favorite?
- Is it different?

74
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,320
- I'd say so, yes.
- All right, you first. Who's yours?

75
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,440
- Anne.
- You said that alarmingly quickly.

76
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,320
- Because it didn't require thought.
- Philip!

77
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,640
- And your favorite is...
- I don't know.

78
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,360
- Liar!
- It's true! I really don't know.

79
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,440
Your lack of self-knowledge sometimes
is breathtaking.

80
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,000
On balance, I'd say that was an asset.

81
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,840
Everyone knows who your favorite is.

82
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,240
- Do they?
- Yes.

83
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,720
Well, who?

84
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,320
Go on.

85
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,720
Philip!

86
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,240
Oh, you can't just leave!

87
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,120
- Watch me.
- Philip!

88
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,680
<i>Anxieties
over Mark's abilities aren't new.</i>

89
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,480
<i>Before the race, he was asked
if his mother worried about him.</i>

90
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,640
<i>All mothers worry about their boys.</i>

91
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,200
<i>It's hard for them to get past
that maternal instinct, isn't it?</i>

92
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,360
<i>They get emotional.</i>

93
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,520
- Mark 24.
- Mark 24.

94
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,600
Eight hundred.

95
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,520
Put a tarp over there.

96
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,960
What are you doing?

97
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,560
This is British overseas territory,

98
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,480
and you have landed illegally.

99
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,600
You and your colleagues
must leave immediately

100
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,920
and remove the Argentine flag.

101
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,800
You are the ones
who are illegal!

102
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,600
<i>¡Viva Argentina!</i>

103
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,000
<i>¡Viva Argentina!</i>

104
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,560
Remove the flag, please,

105
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,760
and board your ship immediately. Go on.

106
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,360
He wants us
to remove our flag from our own land.

115
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,400
I'd like you to arrange for me
to see my four children.

116
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,320
- Uh, ma'am?
- In private, one at a time.

117
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,480
Of course. Um… any particular order?

118
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,440
No, I don't think so.

119
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,120
Important, I think, though,
that each is unaware

120
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,040
that the others have been summoned too.

121
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,800
Yes, ma'am.

122
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,920
Uh…

123
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,840
Martin,

124
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,120
perhaps a short briefing document
ahead of each meeting,

125
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,960
focusing on each child's hobbies,

126
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,560
interests, and so forth.

127
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,480
Right.

128
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,520
One would hate to appear uninformed.

129
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,680
Or cold or remotely…

130
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,440
remote.

131
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,040
Of course, ma'am.

132
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,360
Some encouraging news

133
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,640
in that a Swiss driver
by the name of Michelle Bosi

134
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,400
apparently saw Mark
and his co-driver yesterday.

135
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,480
- Alive?
- Yes, alive.

136
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,200
Lord Carrington and the Foreign Office

137
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,560
have made urgent requests
of the Swiss embassy

138
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,520
to make contact with Bosi
to get more information, but, uh…

139
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,040
But?

140
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,480
Without success.

141
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,480
Brilliant.

142
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,440
They can't even locate
the drivers who aren't lost.

143
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,160
Well, I'd better get over there.

144
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,160
One final thing, Prime Minister.

145
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,480
A small situation developing
in the South Atlantic.

146
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,600
The governor of the Falkland Islands,
Rex Hunt,

147
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:48,240
has asked for permission
for an ice-breaking vessel, HMS Endurance,

148
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,440
to be sent from Port Stanley
to the island of South Georgia

149
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,440
to evict a group
of Argentine scrap metal workers.

150
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,920
HMS Endurance is currently at Port Stanley

151
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,960
and could therefore be manned
with a detachment of Royal Marines

152
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,960
who would easily outnumber
the scrap metal workers

153
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,560
who are trespassing.

154
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,120
Be gone.

155
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,520
I'll take it to the foreign secretary.

156
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,440
I'll show you out.

157
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,920
You just need to give her some time.

158
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,040
Yes, well,
it's not my fault there's traffic.

159
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,200
I know she's busy. So am I.

160
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,520
Go on, off you go.

161
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,400
Honestly!

162
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:05,120
There's a nasty, officious imperiousness
and sense of entitlement to these people.

163
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,600
- I can't help it if roads are closed.
- Darling, so lovely to see you.

164
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,680
Mummy.

165
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,560
Now what's all this?

166
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,080
I got a terrible fright
when I heard you wanted lunch à deux.

167
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,280
This isn't bad news, is it?

168
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,360
I'm still getting my civil list money?

169
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,920
Yes, all 20 thousand pounds of it.

170
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,280
Don't say it like that.

171
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,960
It's rather a lot of money
for someone still at school.

172
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,880
Most of it goes
on secretarial expenses anyway.

173
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,720
Eight hundred pounds goes
on secretarial expenses. I checked.

174
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,200
Which, by my reckoning,
still leaves a small fortune.

175
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,920
All safely tucked away in a trust.
Don't worry.

176
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
What's lunch?

177
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,480
Wait, let me guess.

178
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,600
Poached salmon.

179
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,960
Yes.

180
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,520
Brilliant!

181
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,520
I had a bet with my protection officer
on the way here

182
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,960
that it'd be poached salmon.
It's always poached salmon in this place.

183
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,600
I'm amazed
we don't all have fins and gills.

184
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,880
So you're head boy now.

185
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,720
Guardian. I did tell you
we call it that at Gordonstoun.

186
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,920
Of course, sorry.

187
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,400
What have you learned about yourself
as a consequence?

188
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,960
What?

189
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,320
You know the aphorism,

190
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,960
"No man knows who he truly is

191
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,640
until either his life is threatened
or he's given power."

192
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,960
I'm afraid it's unleashed
the latent policeman in me.

193
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,200
- Don't say that.
- Why?

194
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,440
Discipline is important,

195
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,000
and I have discovered
a taste for enforcing it.

196
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,680
I even had someone sent down last term.

197
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,320
- Sent down where?
- Home.

198
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,880
For smoking.

199
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,760
Weren't you almost caught for smoking?

200
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,880
Almost, yes, but I was clever enough
to get away with it.

201
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,760
Isn't that a little unfair?

202
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,040
It's life, Mummy.

203
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,200
Life has dealt you rather a good hand.

204
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,280
Yes.

205
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,160
But not without its challenges either.

206
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,400
I mean, I might have been bullied a bit
as normal Eddie Windsor,

207
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,600
but as Prince Edward,
third in line to the throne…

208
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Who bullies you?

209
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,760
Pretty much everyone.

210
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,600
How?

211
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,000
You don't want to know.

212
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,960
I do.

213
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,280
All right.

214
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,600
Uh, they call me Jaws, for my braces.

215
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,280
They fill plastic spoons with saliva
and flick it at the back of my head.

216
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,600
They put superglue on my chair.

217
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,040
Gave me a bottle of white wine as a gift,
which turned out to be...

218
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,840
What?

219
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,560
Urine.

220
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,600
They even went to the trouble
of chilling it.

221
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,920
One can't help admiring their ingenuity.

222
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,920
Don't look like that.

223
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,720
Cricket's going well.
Made the first 11 again.

224
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,400
How about academic work?

225
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,680
A-levels next term.
How's that coming along?

226
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,800
- I read your reports.
- Don't believe everything you read.

227
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,240
- If you need any extra help…
- Don't worry!

228
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,800
I've met the Cambridge admissions people.
They'll make it happen.

229
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,480
They're no fools.

230
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,160
It's good for them too.

231
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,280
A member of the royal family
at Jesus College?

232
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,000
Just wait and see
how the applications rocket.

233
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,840
That's not
a particularly attractive attitude.

234
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,760
It's true though, isn't it?
Same with the Marines,

235
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,160
same with the City,
or any area of life I might fancy.

236
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,640
People will always want me.

237
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,840
And what do you expect me
to do about that? Say no?

238
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,080
There has to be some upside
to being who we are.

239
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,920
And some return
for what we do for the country.

240
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,160
<i>There's no news tonight
of the whereabouts of Mark Thatcher,</i>

241
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,680
<i>his fellow driver, Anne-Charlotte Verney,
and their mechanic.</i>

242
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,440
<i>Reports of sightings today
are now being discounted.</i>

243
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,320
<i>This is what the area looks like
on the map.</i>

244
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,200
<i>This is what some of the area looks like
in actuality.</i>

245
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,720
In addition
to the French Air Force planes,

246
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,800
there are now two helicopters,

247
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,880
three desert trucks,

248
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,640
and a glass-bottomed aeroplane
involved in the search for Mark.

249
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,080
That was Daddy.
He's just arrived safely in Algiers.

250
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,840
Thank you.

251
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:28,320
Now the good news is that
with the help of the race organizers,

252
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,440
we have managed to narrow down the search

253
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,040
to a section of the Sahara
between Tamanrasset in Algeria

254
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,320
and Tessalit in northern Mali.

255
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,960
The bad news is, that still leaves us

256
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:47,080
with a search area
of approximately 130,000 square miles.

257
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,320
Will you put that into context for me?

258
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,800
Well, that's bigger
than the entire United Kingdom.

259
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,800
Not now.

260
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,480
I'm sorry. The foreign secretary insisted.

261
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,760
What is it, Charles?

262
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,880
It's the situation in the Falklands.

263
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,280
With HMS Endurance
now on its way to South Georgia

264
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,000
carrying a combat unit of Royal Marines,
if you recall…

265
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,440
Yes, yes,
to evict the scrap metal workers.

266
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,120
The Argentine junta has responded
by sending its own ice patrol ship

267
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,720
and two missile-carrying corvettes.

268
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,640
With what justification?

269
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,440
To protect its citizens.

270
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,000
Who are breaking the law by trespassing.

271
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,480
The foreign secretary
has asked for your support

272
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,840
of his proposed solution.

273
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,920
Which is?

274
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,440
To reroute HMS Endurance

275
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,480
to avoid what he sees
as an unnecessary conflict with Argentina

276
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,000
while the situation
is resolved diplomatically.

277
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,600
You mean to do nothing?

278
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,320
Yes.

279
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,840
And trust all will be well.

280
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:06,720
<i>How </i>will it be well if we <i>do</i> nothing?

281
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,600
How will it possibly end up well
if we do nothing?

282
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,640
Our people, far from home,

283
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,360
their lives are in danger, Charles.

284
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,240
Our own!

285
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,280
We <i>must </i>do something.

286
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,040
If you'll excuse me…

287
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,320
while I get back to my son.

288
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,200
Yes, Prime Minister.

289
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,520
Thank you.

290
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,480
- Just this way, ma'am.
- Thank you.

291
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,040
Yes, fine. Very comfortable, thank you.

292
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,320
- Thank you so much. Hello, darling.
- Hello.

293
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,640
I haven't got long, I'm afraid.

294
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,720
Yes, they warned me.

295
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,320
- So straight out?
- Yes, I just need to change quickly.

296
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,640
It's forecast to rain.
You sure you want to do this?

297
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,880
- Yes, quite sure. Good afternoon, Alan.
- Good afternoon, ma'am.

298
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,336
- How are we?
- Very well, thank you.

299
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,640
He's looking very well, isn't he?
I'll say hello.

300
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,320
Good afternoon. How are you?

301
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,000
Are we going to go for a walk? Yes?

302
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,120
Is this all right? It's a bit wet.

303
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,280
Yes, it's fine.

304
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,800
Isn't this heaven?

305
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,840
- If you say so.
- I do.

306
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,560
Tucked away in the country,
rain and mud and horses and dogs,

307
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,160
children, privacy.

308
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,240
I do envy you.

309
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,440
Well, it's not quite the Eden you imagine.

310
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:59,320
For a start, there isn't privacy.
They are there, wherever I go.

311
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,560
- Who?
- Journalists.

312
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,760
Photographers
who've just got it in for me.

313
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,920
- Bastards.
- Well, if you will keep calling them that…

314
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,480
I told them to naff off.

315
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,280
Once.

316
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,640
And can you blame me?

317
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,880
They're so mean to me all the time.

318
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,800
I'm pretty low-key, as you know.

319
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,800
I don't want praise
or attention or thanks.

320
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,600
But I'm only human. Sometimes
even a pit pony needs a pat on the head.

321
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,560
I know the feeling.

322
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,640
It's not easy…

323
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,400
working in the heat and squalor
of a Third World country

324
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,040
doing real work for real charities.

325
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,520
But do I get as much as a mention
in <i>any </i>newspaper?

326
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,000
Or a thank you? Do I heck.

327
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,360
And yet all <i>she</i> has to do
is put on a frock,

328
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,440
and she's all over all the front pages,
and everyone's falling over in shock

329
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,640
at how wonderful she is.

330
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,840
Who?

331
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,120
Her.

332
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,240
Diana.

333
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,920
The only other young female
in the family, yes,

334
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,480
against whom I am now always compared.

335
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,120
Lovely her, dumpy me.

336
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,240
Smiling her, grumpy me.

337
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,880
Charming her, awful me.

338
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,560
And the constant questions
about my marriage all the time,

339
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,680
about Mark.

340
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,280
Yes, how is Mark?

341
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,720
That's it, exactly like that.
"How is Mark?" Mark's fine!

342
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,720
I'm fine. The children are fine.

343
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,360
Well, I'm happy to hear that.

344
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,640
Only there has been talk.

345
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,960
I thought you didn't listen to talk.

346
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,480
And a meeting recently
with Commander Trestrail.

347
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,240
Who?

348
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,760
The head of the Royal Protection Branch.

349
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:45,240
He felt compelled to mention rumors
about a Sergeant Cross,

350
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,400
and the two of you…

351
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,720
being intimate.

352
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,640
And in light of these rumors,
Scotland Yard has recommended his transfer

353
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,120
back to desk duties in Croydon.

354
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,520
Don't…

355
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,400
Don't do that to me.

356
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,080
You ca...

357
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,200
You can't.
He is the one thing that makes me happy.

358
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,240
- You have so much to make you happy.
- Then how come none of it does?

359
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,080
It will again if you're patient.

360
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,240
Is that it? Is that the advice?

361
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,520
"Stick it out,
grin and bear it. Persevere"?

362
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,840
Well, these things usually pass
if you have the patience to wait.

363
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,800
I used to enjoy my reputation
as the difficult one.

364
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,880
I used to relish scaring people a bit

365
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,600
because I could control it.

366
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,720
But recently…

367
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,680
I'm the one who's scared.

368
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,440
Because it's starting to feel
more like <i>it </i>controls <i>me,</i>

369
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,400
and it's changed.

370
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,760
It's not just feeling angry,
but a kind of…

371
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,320
recklessness…

372
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,400
where I just want to smash it all up.

373
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,200
But that will pass too.

374
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,080
Is that it?

375
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,880
Is doing nothing
your solution to everything?

376
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,640
I must go.

377
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,720
Yes. Sorry, I mustn't keep you.
I know you have things to do.

378
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,720
- You'll find your way back?
- Yes.

379
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:52,120
<i>Mark Thatcher and
his French co-driver, Charlotte Verney,</i>

380
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:56,280
<i>were sighted this morning by
an Algerian Air Force C-130 search plane</i>

381
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,560
<i>only a few miles
from the border with Mali.</i>

382
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,320
<i>As the pilot returned
to the rescue headquarters,</i>

383
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,680
<i>he was embraced by Mr. Denis Thatcher,
Mark's father.</i>

384
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:09,200
<i>Mr. Thatcher telephoned the prime minister
in London to tell her the good news.</i>

385
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:15,120
<i>I am delighted to be able to confirm
the wonderful news</i>

386
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,840
<i>that the rescue mission
has been successful.</i>

387
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,440
<i>Now, of course,</i>

388
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:25,000
<i>you are all used to thinking of me
as prime minister.</i>

389
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:29,880
<i>But what the last few days
has shown me very clearly</i>

390
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:34,640
<i>is that, above all else, I am a mother.</i>

391
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,520
<i>Now, thank you, if you will excuse me…</i>

392
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:41,160
<i>Quite why Mark Thatcher
chose this particular route</i>

393
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,840
<i>remains something of a mystery.</i>

394
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,320
<i>In departing drastically
from the known tracks, he may have…</i>

395
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,640
He must be feeling
rather foolish.

396
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,136
Tired and hungry
is what I'd imagine he's feeling.

397
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,440
Still,
the prime minister will be relieved

398
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,040
to be reunited with her favorite child.

399
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,720
Have you worked out who yours is yet?

400
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,200
<i>He clearly wanted to find
a more direct route across the desert,</i>

401
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,920
<i>but this was, after all,</i>

402
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,240
<i>his first such rally,
and he lacked experience.</i>

403
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,640
I was never worried for my life.
The others were getting a bit existential!

404
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,560
Oh, of course they were, darling.
They're French.

405
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,480
Quite!
No, I remained pretty relaxed

406
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,280
and treated our time in the desert
as a holiday.

407
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,840
- Even had time to read my book.
- Oh, that's nice, darling.

408
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,800
- What's this?
- It's your favorite. Toad-in-the-hole.

409
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:35,080
Yes, I can see that, Mummy,
but, honestly, where's the gravy?

410
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,920
Oh, I am sorry.

411
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,840
Anyway,
when we were eventuallyfound,

412
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,440
all the hoopla came as a bit of a shock.

413
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,080
I had no idea we were celebrities.

414
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:49,000
- On the front cover of the world's papers!
- Oh, you were celebrities.

415
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,200
Not sure that's the word I'd have used.

416
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,840
It was all nonsense, really.

417
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,960
"Prime Minister's Son Lost in the Desert."
'Cause we weren't lost.

418
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,640
I mean, I knew where we were.
It's just that no one else did.

419
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,440
That was the problem.
The truth is, you lot lost us.

420
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,000
But you were off course.
About 30 miles off course.

421
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,640
Carol, it's not quite that simple.
The point is you make your own route.

422
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,880
Driver didn't seem happy when she was
rushed to hospital with heatstroke.

423
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,080
Well, Carol, she was being overdramatic.

424
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,800
Of course she was. She's a woman.

425
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,760
- Quite.
- Pass the wine, darling.

426
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,240
That's brilliant.

427
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,360
Anyway, no sooner are we found
than Dad tells me off!

428
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,040
What?

429
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,760
Why did you do that?

430
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:32,200
I just thought he could have shown
a bit more gratitude to the rescue team.

431
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,960
Why?

432
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,800
It was their job, wasn't it?

433
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,120
And gratitude for what?

434
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,840
He had to wait a whole week.

435
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:43,600
The entire search and rescue operation
was a complete farce.

436
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,120
What do you expect from Bedouins?

437
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,360
Will you excuse me? I need a top-up.

438
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,000
- Would you like some salt, darling?
- No, I think it's fine.

439
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,600
You have to admit, it's intolerable.

440
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,720
It's mothers and sons. That's all it is.

441
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:10,280
Well, thank God
there are fathers and daughters, then.

442
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,520
- Aren't you going to go?
- Why should I go?

443
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,680
They haven't come for me.

444
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:23,360
You and me, dear,
we're the support act in this show.

445
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,240
Get the wine, Carol.

446
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:32,680
You wouldn't believe what it felt like
to get back to the hotel to have a drink.

447
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,920
Sorry to interrupt, Prime Minister.

448
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,960
Our latest intelligence
from Buenos Aires suggests that,

449
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,440
faced with a desperate situation
domestically,

450
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,880
the fear is the military junta
might consider an attack on the Falklands

451
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,240
a risk worth taking,

452
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,560
that it will play well
with the Argentine people.

453
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,480
Tell the foreign secretary
to come and see me.

454
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,080
He's in Brussels.

455
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,800
- And the chief of the defence staff?
- He's in New Zealand.

456
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,920
Then the defence secretary.

457
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,720
He's in the United States.

458
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,120
When we are about to be attacked,

459
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:17,200
I fail to understand
the lack of urgency from everyone.

460
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,840
Tell the foreign secretary
and the chief of the defence staff

461
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:24,840
and the defence secretary I want them
in my office by this time tomorrow.

462
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,200
Prime Minister.

463
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,920
<i>Navy 479 confirming
low-level flypast to the east,</i>

464
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,200
not above 500 ft. on the London QNH 1013.

465
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,120
I want to make a bit of an entrance.

466
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,600
You don't think arriving by helicopter
is enough of an entrance?

467
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,520
So the idea is to meet there, is it?
For lunch?

468
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,400
Um, out by four-ish?

469
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,800
Oh dear.

470
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,560
Leave it with me.

471
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,200
I said leave it with me.

472
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,640
Prince Andrew, Your Majesty.

473
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,720
Your Majesty.

474
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,640
- Mummy.
- How did you get away with that?

475
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,760
What, the chopper?

476
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,800
I told them the truth.

477
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,320
That I'd been summoned
on a matter of national importance

478
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,520
by the commander in chief
of the Armed Forces.

479
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,520
It's a mother-and-son lunch.
Hardly a matter of national importance.

480
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,440
You're the Queen,
and I'm second in line to the throne.

481
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,560
We break wind,
it's a matter of national importance.

482
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,480
Oh, stop it!

483
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,240
It's true!

484
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,760
And as it happens,

485
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,480
there are one or two things
I'd like to discuss with you.

486
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,920
- The first is my title.
- What title?

487
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,840
The one you bestow upon me when I marry.

488
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,400
Oh.

489
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,400
I hadn't given it a moment's thought.

490
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,360
I had no idea
you were thinking of getting married.

491
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,440
I'm not.

492
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,920
Well, not seriously.

493
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:01,440
Although this latest one
is quite something.

494
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:04,240
Oh, yes, the young, racy American actress.

495
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,520
Yes!

496
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,080
Not sure which word
makes my heart sink most.

497
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,360
Mustn't believe what you read.

498
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,480
I have nothing else to go on,
since you haven't brought her to meet me,

499
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,720
and it's unlikely I'd know her
from her oeuvre.

500
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:19,360
Really? You're not familiar
with <i>The Awakening of Emily?</i>

501
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,040
No. Should I be?

502
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,560
I'm not sure it's your cup of tea.
Not because it's blue.

503
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:26,040
- Oh, Andrew!
- Though it's really not blue at all.

504
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,080
It's set in the 1920s,

505
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:33,400
and follows an impressionable,
nubile 17-year-old girl, Koo.

506
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,480
Seventeen?
I'm not sure I want to know more.

507
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,920
Don't be such a prude, Mummy.

508
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,440
The story is that she returns home
from a finishing school in Switzerland

509
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,840
to her mother's country house
in the English countryside.

510
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,560
- You know they used Wilton?
- What, the Herberts' house?

511
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:48,040
- Yes. That's where they filmed it.
- That's a lovely house.

512
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,000
Your grandpapa used to go shooting there.

513
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:55,440
Anyway, there she meets several
twisted and perverted older predators

514
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:59,600
who seduce the vulnerable,
helpless young Emily

515
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,200
as we follow her induction
into sensual pleasures.

516
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,560
You're right. It doesn't sound blue.

517
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,800
- Are you sure it was even legal?
- Who cares?

518
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,000
It might come as a shock to you
to know that<i> I </i>care.

519
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,440
The point is, it's art,

520
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:18,000
which means it's perfectly appropriate
for a future Duchess of…

521
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,920
York.

522
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,600
- York?
- Yes, York. The idea just came to me.

523
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,240
It's the dukedom that
traditionally goes to the second eldest

524
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,240
and has long military associations.

525
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,480
As in "the Grand Old Duke of…"

526
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,560
Exactly.

527
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,560
Didn't the previous two Dukes of York
also both become king?

528
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:40,760
Yes, due to the unexpected death
or abdication of their elder brothers.

529
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,560
In your case,
not only would Charles have to die,

530
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,360
you'd have to murder any sons he had.

531
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,160
The Duke of York has history
in that department too. Richard III.

532
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,960
Oh, yes! You are clever.

533
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,080
This salmon is delicious.

534
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,600
Isn't it?

535
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,480
Speaking of military associations,

536
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,640
there is something else
I wanted to discuss.

537
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,720
When you're part of a frontline unit,
as I am,

538
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,880
you keep a pretty close eye
on what's going on.

539
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,280
And the talk is that this Falklands thing
isn't going to go away.

540
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,800
Now…

541
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,600
I'd never ask you
to divulge what goes on

542
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,880
in your private audiences
with your prime ministers...

543
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,840
And I'd never tell.

544
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,640
I just wanted to let you know
if the situation were to escalate,

545
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,920
I'd insist on going.

546
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,840
And I'd want your assurance

547
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,560
the Crown would not stand between me
and frontline service.

548
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,080
I wouldn't dream of it.

549
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,400
Good!

550
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:38,480
We never shirk action in this family.
Ever. We're no different to anyone else.

551
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,480
That's what I spend my life
telling everyone.

552
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,240
Ma'am, I've had a call

553
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,440
from the Prince of Wales's
private secretary,

554
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:10,040
who wondered if instead of seeing
His Royal Highness tomorrow in London,

555
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,960
you might like to visit his new house,
Highgrove, in Gloucestershire.

556
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,120
Would that work timewise?

557
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,360
Yes. At a pinch, we could still get you
back to London by evening.

558
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,640
- All right. Why not?
- Ma'am.

559
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,320
Thank you.

560
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,680
There has been a dramatic escalation
in naval radio traffic.

561
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,600
GCHQ has also detected
unusual flight activity.

562
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,760
It does now appear
a major Argentine deployment

563
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,560
is on its way to the Falkland Islands

564
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,080
with, one can only assume,
the intention of invading.

565
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,800
Then we must defend them, robustly.

566
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,640
I feel obliged to mention, Prime Minister,

567
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,720
that diplomatic channels are still open.

568
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,960
With respect,
the time for diplomacy passed

569
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,920
the moment they planted an Argentine flag
on British territory.

570
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,120
I quite agree.

571
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,400
We can get a task force together
to defend the islands within 48 hours.

572
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,680
Oh, that's absurd.

573
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,600
Why?

574
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,920
It's 8,000 miles away.

575
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,200
It would take any naval vessel
three weeks to get there.

576
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,480
By that time,
the Falkland Islands will be Argentine.

577
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,600
Then I say we retake them.

578
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,080
It's impossible.

579
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,880
Is it impossible, Admiral?

580
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,320
Do you think we could?

581
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,760
I do, Prime Minister.

582
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,240
Then we must.

583
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,520
But the cost alone…
Sending 30,000 military personnel

584
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,120
to the South Atlantic
on the back of a recession

585
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,880
where output is still low
and unemployment breathtakingly high…

586
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,640
We must consider public opinion.

587
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,720
This government…

588
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,840
This administration is currently…

589
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,800
Go on, Geoffrey.

590
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,680
Say it.

591
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,920
Unloved. Unpopular.

592
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,560
We will never survive
an unnecessary and unaffordable war.

593
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:56,760
And I say we will not survive
<i>not </i>going to war.

594
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,880
Admiral, will you please join me
in the flat upstairs

595
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,880
to discuss this further?
Say, in half an hour.

596
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,480
- Ask the chiefs of staff to join us.
- Of course.

597
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,920
Ah, good. You're here.

598
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,840
I need your help.

599
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,640
We must prepare dinner
for the chiefs of staff.

600
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,120
I want to talk to you.

601
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,640
Darling, not now.

602
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,280
- Why is Mark so obviously your favorite?
- What?

603
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,200
You have twin children,
and you clearly prefer one over the other.

604
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,800
Carol, that's not true.

605
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:56,000
It is indisputably and painfully true.

606
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,560
And what I want to say to you is…
just because you had

607
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,400
a difficult relationship
with your mother…

608
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,160
Darling, I don't have time for this.

609
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:09,280
…you cannot let it affect
your relationship with all women.

610
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,520
- Most of all, your own daughter.
- Darling, you do pick your moments.

611
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:17,200
I am <i>busy. </i>In a few minutes,
I have the chiefs of staff coming.

612
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,280
Then give me one of those minutes.

613
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,880
You disregard me.

614
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,040
You overlook me.

615
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,360
And you favor Mark.

616
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,680
Because he's stronger.

617
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,360
Like my father was stronger.

618
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,160
Yes. You are right.

619
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,240
I did struggle with my mother,

620
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:49,120
but it had nothing to do with her sex.

621
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,920
It had to do with her weakness.

622
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:59,920
I could not <i>bear</i> how she was prepared
to just be a housewife.

623
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,840
Because her husband treated her as such.

624
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,840
That is <i>not </i>true!

625
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:10,120
Your grandfather, my father,
was wonderful with women.

626
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,200
Wonderful.

627
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,800
He encouraged me. He taught me.

628
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,120
He made me who I am.

629
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,960
He was determined
my ambition be limitless.

630
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,960
And he tried with your grandmother.

631
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:30,600
But there is a limit to what one can do

632
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,640
if people are themselves limited.

633
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,880
Our frigates are equipped
with Sea Wolf missiles,

634
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,960
accompanied by a full commander brigade

635
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,720
and amphibious crew.

636
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,600
Thank you, dear.

637
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,880
May I?

638
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,440
Tell me when.

639
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,200
That's a nice piece.

640
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:12,280
Please feel free
to serve the peas and the carrots.

641
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,800
Excellent.
Can we add a side salad

642
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,880
and a glass of squash?

643
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,120
- Of course, sir.
- Thank you.

644
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,480
I know you're not feeling well,

645
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:38,120
but I would remind you
she's not just your mother-in-law.

646
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,600
She's also your queen!

647
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:42,880
Diana!

648
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,040
Diana!

649
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,080
Diana!

650
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,840
Diana.

651
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:03,760
<i>Yes, tell us
a princess fairy story. Yes, please.</i>

652
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,960
<i>All right.</i>

653
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,040
<i>I'll tell you a story. In fact…</i>

654
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,840
Honestly, it's pathetic.

655
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,200
<i>…if Gabriel will please play for me,</i>

656
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,440
<i>and Bagpuss will please think for me.</i>

657
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:17,200
<i>Oh, all right.
What shall I think of?</i>

658
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,760
<i>Think of
a beautiful water princess</i>

659
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:22,040
<i>wearing a tiny silver crown.</i>

660
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,160
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

661
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,000
- Thank you.
- Mummy.

662
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,200
Oh, this is lovely.

663
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,840
- So glad you could do this.
- Just you?

664
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,160
Yes. Diana's in bed. I'm afraid
she's not having an easy time of it.

665
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:08,800
Oh, poor thing. I was lucky.
Pregnancy didn't seem to affect me.

666
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,560
Yes, but you're two very different women.

667
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,720
- Shall we start outside?
- Yes, all right. Thank you.

668
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,040
How many people do you have here?

669
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,280
It might look like a lot,

670
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,800
but we're effectively
starting from scratch.

671
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:30,040
I think that was the attraction.
Tabula rasa. A clean slate.

672
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:32,040
Yes, I know what "tabula rasa" means.

673
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:33,880
Gosh, listen to that.

674
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:36,800
No insects. No birdsong.

675
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
It's terrible.

676
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,000
A dreadful, morbid silence.

677
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:46,240
There's nowhere for the insects to go,
so I was thinking of a wild garden there,

678
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,240
walled garden here…

679
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,840
kitchen garden there,

680
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,800
a sundial garden there.

681
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,680
It's always important
when embarking on a project like this

682
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,400
to have purity of purpose.

683
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,280
A single controlling idea
at the heart of it all.

684
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:01,960
So what's yours?

685
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:06,120
That eventually the house,
the land, and the garden

686
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:09,160
should reflect who I really am
and what I'm all about.

687
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,600
So the big idea is you.

688
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,160
So everything will be done organically.
No chemicals or pesticides.

689
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,560
There'll be no straight lines,

690
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:24,160
no manicuring,
nothing too neat or uniform.

691
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:28,320
A certain wild unconventionality about it.

692
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:29,880
Is that you too?

693
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,120
Well, it's anyone
of any interest, isn't it?

694
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:33,560
Um…

695
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,840
Who'd obey rules? Who'd be conventional?

696
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:40,720
Don't you hate it when gardeners
impose straight lines everywhere?

697
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,880
Nature abhors a straight line, after all.

698
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:47,000
That pool looks like
it's going to have straight lines.

699
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,240
Well, yes, but that's a pool.

700
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:52,920
Is that going to be a tennis court?
Doesn't look particularly organic either.

701
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,160
- Mummy.
- Sorry. No, it's lovely.

702
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:57,960
I'm glad you like it.

703
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,960
I really think I could be happy here.

704
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,400
It's brought something out in me.

705
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:06,920
My own little Shangri-La or Xanadu.

706
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,280
"And there were gardens
bright with sinuous rills,

707
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:16,400
Where blossomed
many an incense-bearing tree;

708
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:21,120
And here were forests
ancient as the hills,

709
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,920
Enfolding sunny spots of greenery."

710
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,400
Oh, your wisteria's coming on.

711
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,680
It's flowering already.

712
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,080
If we're going to have lunch,
we should make a start.

713
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,520
- They want me back in London by six.
- Of course.

714
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,520
<i>But the truth is,
I don't know what's wrong with her.</i>

715
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:43,200
She grew up in the country.
I thought she'd love it here.

716
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,840
I asked her to oversee
the interior decoration.

717
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:49,320
That seemed to distract her
for a few weeks.

718
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,600
Then she started withdrawing again.

719
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:55,400
Locking herself in her room,
watching endless hours of…

720
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,240
television.

721
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,320
She's so intellectually incurious.

722
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,320
I tried giving her tutorials
on Shakespeare and poetry,

723
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,680
expand her horizons.

724
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:10,880
We've had some wonderful guests.

725
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,320
Laurens van der Post,

726
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,560
Eric Anderson, the headmaster of Eton.

727
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:19,320
But she shows no interest,
just talks endlessly about missing London.

728
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,880
Perhaps that's what she likes.

729
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,640
Perhaps this part of the world
doesn't suit her.

730
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,920
When you chose Gloucestershire,
I did wonder why.

731
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,120
It was so convenient.

732
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,480
The RAF airfield nearby,

733
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:35,600
proximity to Cornwall,
and Anne's just a stone throw away.

734
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,040
Not just Anne.

735
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,920
Only a 15-minute drive, I heard.

736
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:48,040
Camilla and I just hunt together
these days. That's all.

737
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,440
And talk on the telephone.

738
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,000
- How often?
- As often as is necessary.

739
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,760
More often when I need cheering up.

740
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,840
When you need cheering up?

741
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,160
You've just bought your dream house,

742
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:09,200
your Xanadu,
that you and an army of sycophants

743
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,880
are turning into the living embodiment
of your soul.

744
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:14,640
And your young, beautiful wife,
struggling with pregnancy,

745
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:18,320
has locked herself in a room upstairs
and is refusing to come out.

746
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,960
You know how I hate interfering.

747
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:27,320
It's not for me to tell a grown man
what to do. But in your position,

748
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:30,400
I might be inclined to worry less
about my own happiness

749
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:34,320
and pay more attention to the well-being
of the mother of my future child.

750
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:30,760
- Oh, hello, you.
- Hello, you.

751
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:31,840
We got the message.

752
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,680
SOS. 999. We dropped everything.

753
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,120
What's the matter, darling?

754
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,200
Drink.

755
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,440
Is that a question or an order?

756
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,960
More of a cry for help, I think.

757
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,200
Coming right up.

758
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,800
Was the open door an invitation?

759
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,720
Not that sort of invitation.

760
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,320
I was hoping we might talk.

761
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:45,480
Our children.

762
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:46,960
Ah.

763
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,960
Have you reached a conclusion

764
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:54,200
after all
those little confidential lunches,

765
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:55,280
one-by-one?

766
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,880
- Oh, you found out?
- Mm.

767
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:00,920
They all rang me, utterly perplexed,

768
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,920
wondering what on earth
you were up to.

769
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,880
The conclusion I have come to is
that it's our children that are lost,

770
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,360
not the prime minister's.

771
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,200
Each in their own deserts.

772
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,040
Anne's not lost.

773
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:16,200
Her marriage is.

774
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,160
All right. Edward's not lost.

775
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:21,120
I disagree.

776
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:25,600
He seems entirely lost,
and bullied, and vengeful.

777
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:28,240
I'll concede that Charles is lost…

778
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,480
but he always has been.

779
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:35,120
And as for Andrew…

780
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,280
Your favorite?

781
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:45,320
I was shocked.

782
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,080
If he doesn't change…

783
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,680
What does that say about us as parents?

784
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,560
- I spoke to Mummy about it.
- Ah.

785
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:07,640
The oracle.

786
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:10,520
What did she say?

787
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:15,080
She said that I must not blame myself.
I'm already mother to the nation.

788
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:16,960
Well, she's right.

789
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,520
It was me that wanted Andrew and Edward.
You didn't want any more.

790
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,440
I wanted two more to prove to myself
that I had it in me…

791
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:28,960
and to make up for my failings.

792
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:33,120
Especially with Charles.

793
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,160
You're a man. You wouldn't understand.

794
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:42,600
But I remember insisting
that I would never let the nannies do it.

795
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:45,360
What?

796
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:48,800
Bath time.

797
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,520
But when it came to it…

798
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,680
I sat in a chair in the background.

799
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,320
Because I didn't know how to…

800
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:09,560
How to what?

801
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:15,080
Hold him, touch him.

802
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:28,280
Look at me.

803
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,240
Look at me.

804
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,320
You must stop this nonsense.

805
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:38,040
You are a perfectly good mother.

806
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,400
And the children are adults now, you know?

807
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,680
It's their responsibility
to sort themselves out.

808
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,120
- <i>If </i>they sort themselves out.
- Well, they will.

809
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,280
Eventually.

810
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:49,680
And…

811
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:54,440
…in the meantime,
it is your job to...

812
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:56,960
Stick around, stay alive,
and keep breathing.

813
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:00,240
Precisely.

814
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:04,080
For all our sakes.

815
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:22,560
Get some rest.

816
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:21,800
<i>At precisely 10:15 this morning,</i>

817
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:25,240
<i>HMS Invincible,
flagship of this extraordinary fleet,</i>

818
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:26,320
<i>slipped her moorings</i>

819
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,600
<i>and eased gently into the calm waters
of Portsmouth Harbour.</i>

820
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:33,600
<i>The operation, and Britain's commitment
to this task force, had begun.</i>

821
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:37,120
<i>In the naval base,
they'd worked all night to get her ready.</i>

822
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,680
<i>Portsmouth, Pompey of tradition,</i>

823
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:41,800
<i>had turned out in force
the loved ones of these men.</i>

824
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,040
<i>At last, she was clear away,</i>

825
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:46,960
<i>into the haze of the Solent.</i>

826
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:48,560
<i>Half an hour later,</i>

827
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:51,320
<i>it was the turn of Hermes,
the older generation of carrier,</i>

828
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,160
<i>but perhaps looking more menacing,</i>

829
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:55,520
<i>with her hardware displayed
for all to see.</i>

830
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:57,480
<i>The people said goodbye.</i>

831
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:59,040
<i>A small boy saluted.</i>

832
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:01,480
<i>"Godspeed," they shouted.</i>

833
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,400
<i>And then, more softly,</i>

834
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,400
<i>"Come back safely."</i>
