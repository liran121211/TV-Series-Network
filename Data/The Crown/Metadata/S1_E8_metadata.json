Margaret takes over some of her sister's official duties and tries to liven things up.", "The queen and Philip embark on a six month Commonwealth tour which he dismisses as an absurd pantomime given that many of the countries desire independence, later accusing her of trying to live up to her father's image and persisting in his view that the itinerary is exhausting her. In her absence Margaret takes on many public appearances in the hopes that it will take her mind off Townsend but they still keep in touch. Furthermore she writes her own speeches, revelling in the publicity and hoping it will win popular support for herself and her lover. Churchill is disapproving and Elizabeth rebukes her on her return, accusing her of showing individuality, anathema to a royal's public image. Meanwhile the queen mother, dismayed at having to withdraw from the spotlight, buys the Castle of Mey in Scotland.\u2014don @ minifie-1"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "5325140", "rating": 8.3, "votes": 5171, "number_of_episodes": 60}
