Cersei is on the Iron Throne after Tommen's suicide, dying for vengeance on all traitors, but Jaime points out they desperately needs allies instead to stand a chance against the Targeryen threat. Euron Greyjoy offers her an alliance by marriage between 'rightful rulers', but she declines and he promises to return with an irresistible gift. In between menial Citadel library services, Sam learns Archmaester Ebrose believes him but sees no need to permit him before graduation to study a defense against Winter as it always passed, so Sam steal a dead man's key to sneak into the forbidden section, where he learns dragon glass is massively available at one site: the Targeryen castle Dragon Rock, where Daenerys just landed with Theon's Iron Fleet. Arya enjoys generous hospitality at a Lannister troops camp fire and learns the plight of war-recruited farm boys, but remains revenge-obsessed.

The Hound begins to believe in the Lord of Light after Thoros shows him a fiery vision of the Wall and the Army of the Dead. In King's Landing, Jaime tells Cersei they crucially need allies. Euron arrives to propose marriage in exchange for his Iron Fleet and an opportunity to kill Theon and Yara. Cersei declines over his untrustworthiness; Euron promises to return with a gift that will prove his loyalty.
