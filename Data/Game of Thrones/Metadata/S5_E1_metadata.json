Tyrion and Varys arrive at Pentos. In Meereen, a new enemy emerges. Jon is caught between two kings.", "Cersei comes to the funeral of her father Tywin Lannister and blames her brother Jaime for his death. Tyrion arrives at his destination transported in a wooden box and Lord Varys discloses that Jaime had asked him to save his brother. White Rat is murdered in a brothel and Daenerys asks Grey Worm to find the killer. She visits her dragons in the dungeons but they do not respect her. Jon Snow is training a teenager, but Melisandre brings him to talk to Stannis Baratheon. He assigns Snow to convince Mance Rayder to bend his knees for him and make his people fight with his army. Will Mance accept the deal?\u2014Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil", "In King's Landing, Tywin lies in state. Cersei wants Jaime to hunt down Tyrion and kill him. At the wake, Cersei notices the budding relationship between Margaery and King Tommen. Lancel has taken religion and reminds Cersei of what he did for her. Tyrion and Varys arrive in Pentos. Varys wants Tyrion to support Daenerys. In Meereen, one on the Unsullied is killed. Urged on by Daario, Daenerys considers releasing her dragons. At Castle Black, Melissandre introduces Jon Snow to Stannis Baratheon who wants him to convince Mance Rayder to join the fight against Roose Bolton, who now occupies much of the North and what is left of Winterfell.\u2014garykmcd", "Jaime warns Cersei at the cathedral wake that their father Tywin's legacy is intact unless to let themselves by divided, but she's obsessed with old grudges, especially revenge on patricidal Tyrion, whose escapes she can't forgive her brother. Loras Tyrell enjoys making gay love with Olyvar as good as openly, speculating with sister Maergery if Tywin's dynastic marriage plan died with the Hand. Barefoot, minor royal cousin Lancel Lannister's call for Cersei to join the austere 'sparrows' sect is waved as if a knavish phase. Aching from the escape in a barrel, Tyrion intends to withdrew in obscurity, but lord Varys, who arranged his passage to Pentos, pleads taking responsibility towards Westeros, after his own part in the end of unsuitable king Robert Baratheon, by joining Daenerys's bid for the Iron throne. Haughty king Stannis wants the Wildlings to join his army to take the North from Roose Bolton and thus revenge Robb, but will only 'pardon' them if their king Mance kneels for him, which he refuses despite confident Jon Snow's plea and knowing the alternative is the stake, where Jon's arrow cuts his agony short. Making love with the queen, Daario warns her against refusing any popular demands to restore customs she despises, especially the gladiatorial 'pit fights' that started his own mercenary career when sold off by his parents. On his insisting she tries to revive her role as mother of dragons, but the two chained ones have turned bitterly hostile in the dungeons, the third remains missing. The Unsullied are unhappy brothel customers, and there targets of a murderous rebel sect. Petyr surprises Sansa by taking her away from the Vale for safety.\u2014KGF Vissers", "In a flashback, a witch foretells a teenage Cersei that she will one day be a queen until a younger and more beautiful queen usurps her. The witch also predicts Cersei will have three children and her king husband will have twenty. In the present, Tywin is buried, and Lancel Lannister returns, now a devoted convert of a fanatical religious cult called the \"Sparrows.\" In Pentos on Essos, a despondent Tyrion accompanies Varys to Meereen to meet Daenerys, who Varys believes may be worthy of the Iron Throne. In Meereen, the insurgent \"Sons of the Harpy\" murder an Unsullied. Daenerys angrily resists restoring old local traditions, including reopening the fighting pits. Missandei asks Grey Worm about why some Unsullied visit brothels. Daenerys visits her two confined dragons, who act aggressively toward her. In the Vale, Littlefinger puts Robin in House Royce's care when he and Sansa depart. At the Wall, Stannis Baratheon seeks to recruit the Wildlings in his war against Roose Bolton, offering citizenship and land as a reward. Jon is unable to persuade Mance Rayder to \"bend the knee\" to Stannis. As Mance is burned alive, Jon ends his agony with an arrow to the heart."], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "3658012", "rating": 8.3, "votes": 37017, "number_of_episodes": 74}
