While he goes hunting with his brother Renly he puts Ned on the throne. A group of farmers complain of having been attacked by a Knight and his army and knowing the culprit orders him stripped of all titles and lands. Ned decides to send Arya and Sansa back to Winterfell for their protection. Sansa in particular doesn't want to leave saying she wants to marry Joffre and have blond babies. Her offhand remark leads Ned back to the book his predecessor was so interested in and he now understands why John Arryn was visiting King Robert's bastard children. Meanwhile, Daenerys and her brother Viserys have yet another confrontation but this one is settled by Drogo himself. An imprisoned Tyrion Lannister demands to be tried and asks for trial by combat.\u2014garykmcd", "Throne pretender Viserys Targaryen, jealous of his sister's growing power as Khal Drogo's Dothraki queen, uses a dragon egg himself, but harvests a golden crown that kills. Horribly treated captive murder suspect Tyrion Lannister needs bribery just to get a trial, then finds his only real chance an ordeal, for which surprisingly a local knight volunteers as formidable champion against the vicious regent's. King Robert puts his vindictive queen in her place and old friend Ned back in office as Hand, even shortly on the throne during another royal hunt, long enough to shock the nobility by outlawing an allegedly rogue knightly lord without even hearing him.\u2014KGF Vissers", "King Robert reinstates Ned as the King's Hand and goes hunting.

Villagers from Riverrun arrive with news of atrocities committed by raiders, who Ned deduces were led by Ser Gregor Clegane, a Lannister retainer. Ned sentences Ser Gregor to death and summons Tywin Lannister to a trial. Ned decides to send Sansa (now reconciled with Joffrey) and Arya back to Winterfell. Ned has discovered that Joffrey and his two siblings are not Robert's biological children, and were fathered by Jaime Lannister. Bran, while testing his new saddle, is attacked by rogue Wildings. Robb, Ned's oldest son, and Theon, Ned's captive ward, whose father, King Balon, was a fallen rebel, rescue him, and the woman Wilding, Osha, is enslaved. In the Vale, Tyrion demands a trial by combat. Lysa chooses Ser Vardis as her champion. The sellsword Bronn volunteers as Tyrion's champion. He defeats Vardis and obtains Tyrion's release. Meanwhile, Viserys grows impatient and angry waiting for Drogo to fulfill his promise, and he threatens to kill Daenerys' unborn child.
