She decides to round up the heads of the 13 richest families in the city and introduce them to her dragons. Jorah Mormont and Tyrion Lannister approach the ancient city of Valyria and, after witnessing something quite incredible, they are set upon by the Stone Men, and Mormont does not escape unscathed. Sansa finally sees what has become of Theon, courtesy of Ramsay Bolton's jealous mistress. Ramsay is particularly cruel to Theon at a dinner, much to Roose Bolton's displeasure. At Castle Black, Jon Snow tries to convince Tormund Giantsbane to move his people south of the Wall and settle in lands that will be made available to them. Most of the men of the Watch object to the plan.\u2014garykmcd", "In Meereen, Grey Worm is wounded and Barristan is dead. Daenerys decides to arrest the leaders of the wealthy families and feeds one of them to her dragons. Jon Snow proposes a deal to Tormund to move the wildlings south of the Wall and join forces with the Night's Watch, and a great number of his men do not accept the truce. Stannis and his army head to the North to fight against the Boltons. Brienne sends a message to Sansa in case she is in danger, and Sansa is lured into reuniting with Theon. Daenerys reviews her position and decides to open the arenas again to placate the insurgent Meereenese.

Jon Sow risks splitting up the Night Watch by promising no longer cultivated land to the Wildlings if they stop raiding and join the winter war, but Tormund can only accept if Jon accompanies him to convince the remaining free tribes. Stannis lets them use his fleet, but takes the army on a campaign to reconquer the North, on the road to Kings Landing. Jorah hoped to avoid pirate danger by sailing past Valyria, but Tyrion is nearly killed by the attacking 'stone men', and after they beach-up without boat, Jorah can only hide being infected with Grey skin disease. After the Sons of the Harpy managed to kill Ser Barristan and badly wound Grey Worm, who feels utterly guilty, Deanerys's misrule reaches a new low of injustice, arresting all heads of Mireen's thirteen old master families, threatening to feed them to her dragons, getting one arbitrarily incinerated, only to apologize next day to their groveling spokesman Hizdahr zo Loraq and announcing to wed him and reinstating pit fights, albeit 'for free men only'.\u2014KGF Vissers", "Brienne and Podrick arrive at an inn near Winterfell and smuggle a message to Sansa, offering her help if it is needed.
