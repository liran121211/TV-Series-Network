Jaime would gladly do it but admits that he cannot wield a sword effectively with his left hand. Bronn, who has fought for him once before, has accepted the Queen Regent's offer of an arranged marriage with a noblewoman and so is not available. Tyrion finds a champion in someone unexpected. Brienne and Pod stop at an inn and meet Arya's old friend, Hotpie, who tells them she's alive and probably heading to the Eyrie. Daenerys takes Daario into her bed but seeks advice on ruling from her most trusted source. At the Eyrie, Peter Baelish has shocking news for both Sansa and his wife Lysa.\u2014garykmcd", "Jaime visits Tyrion, scolding his self-damning rejection of Tywin's deal, however defeatist, and sadly can't be his champion as his left hand isn't nearly trained enough, Bronn refuses to risk his new-found wealth and spare heiress wedding for a weird friend. Jon returns with his survivors, hailed by the men but scorned by the acting commander, who orders his wolf caged and details him to night rounds, dismissing the urge to disable any access by caving as the Watch stands no chance against the vastly greater army Mance is fielding. Surprise visitor Obyron promises Tyrion to be his champion against Gregor 'The Mountain' Clegane, Cersei's seemingly unbeatable champion, who practices to chopping helpless convicts to pieces. Mercenary leader and suitor Daario finally gets his carnal night with Daenerys after a strip muster, but Jorah talks her out of deputizing him to reconquer Yunkai. Sansa regrets only after the act annoying her groom host Robin Arryn, but Petyr reassures her he'll deal with the regent aunt Lysa, whose protest of ingratitude is punished by pushing her through the moon door.
