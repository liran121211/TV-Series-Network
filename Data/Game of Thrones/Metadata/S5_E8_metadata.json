Theon explains too viciously pouting Sansa Ramsay broke his will by torture and confides he didn't burn her kid brothers but passes off two farm boys for Bran and Rickon. Ramsay asks Roose fro twenty men to surprise-attack Stannis. Even Daenerys realizes she needs counsel if still hoping to conquer Westeros, hence accepts clever Tyrion to her small council, but he can only get her to spare Jorah the promised execution, not lift his banishment.
