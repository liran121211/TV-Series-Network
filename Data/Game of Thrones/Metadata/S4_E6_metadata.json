Yara leaves him behind and returns home. Daenerys listens to the petitions of supplicants and takes decisions. Stannis and Davos go to Braavos seeking a loan. Tyrion's trial begins and Jaime makes a deal with his father to save his brother.

Their initial reception is poor but Stannis' arguments may sway them. Theon Greyjoy's sister Yara attempts to rescue him but finds that the brother she once knew no longer exists. Daenerys begins to realize what it means to rule. At Castle Rock, Tyrion's trial begins and as expected the cards have been stacked against him. Everyone he's ever crossed seems to line up to testify. One witness is particularly hurtful and realizing he could never successfully plead his case, demands trial by combat.\u2014garykmcd", "Boy king Tommen excuses himself and passes the Iron Throne to Hand Tywin to preside over Tyrion's regicide trial, likely to end fatally given the damning witness list and small council-admitted princes Tyrell and Obryn, who is fascinated by mysterious eunuch lord without actual title Varys. Ramsay Snow takes pleasure in fighting off the single ship crew that invaded his castle under Yara Greyjoy to rescue Theon, whom he terrorized in such slavish submission as the deny his identity before becoming loyal dog Reek, who is rewarded with a bath and instructed to go on a mission, \"playing\" Theon to win his master a castle. In Braabos, the Iron Bank is not impressed with Stannis's claim to fianc\u00e9 the \"only true king,\" given his lack of real resources, but Davos still gets enough gold on credit to hire a pirate fleet for a landing. A long procession of supplicants at the Meereen throne confronts Daenerys with the drudgery of ruling and some dishonorable results of her blindly vindictive \"justice\" on top of rapacious dragon damages. Jaime strike a deal with Tywin: he'll resign from the royal guard to become Lannister heir and castle lord again, if Tyrion is 'pardoned' to join the Night Watch. Hurt by insulting testimonies, even from Shae, Tyrion holds an offensive tirade stating he would wish to have killed Joffrey and the whole audience, but invokes his right to a trial by duel.\u2014KGF Vissers", "In Essos, Davos and Stannis meet with the Iron Bank to secure a loan for Stannis. Davos re-engages Salladhor Saan and his pirates. In Meereen, Daenerys adapts to her new role as queen, hearing her subjects' endless requests, including nobleman Hizdahr zo Loraq who wishes to reclaim his crucified father's body, and a peasant man whose goats were killed by Daenerys' increasingly uncontrollable dragons. In the Dreadfort, Yara leads a mission to rescue Theon, who, emotionally broken, refuses to leave, forcing Yara to abandon him. Ramsay rewards Theon's obedience and, planning to take Moat Cailin, tasks \"Reek\" to impersonate \"Theon Greyjoy.\" In King's Landing, Tywin puts a bounty on the Hound's head and instructs Varys to continue spying on Daenerys.
