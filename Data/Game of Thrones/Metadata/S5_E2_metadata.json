Jaime takes on a secret mission. Ellaria Sand seeks revenge for Oberyn's death. Stannis makes Jon a generous offer as the Night's Watch elects a new Lord Commander. Daenerys is faced with a difficult decision.", "SPOILERS AHEAD: Arya Stark sails to Braavos and arrives at the House of Black and White to seek out Jaqen H'ghar; however she is not welcomed to enter in the house and she throws her coin away into the sea. Brienne and Podrick are eating in a tavern and see Sansa and Little Finger, but Sansa refuses to follow Brienne. The men that are escorting Little Finger and Sansa unsuccessfully hunt Brienne and Podrick down on the road. Cersei shows to Jaime that their daughter Myrcella is in danger and Jaime seeks out Bronn and makes an offer for him to travel with him to Dorn. In Meereen, the Son of Harpy is captured and Daenerys has a meeting with her leaders to decide his fate. Barristan advises her to give a fair trial to the man; however Mossador disobeys her order and kills the Son of Harpy. Daenerys sentences him to death and there is a riot in Meereen. Jon Snow is invited by Stannis Baratheon to serve him; in return, he would give the North to Jon and he would be Jon Stark, Lord of Winterfell. But Jon Snow turns the invitation down and he is chosen to be the new Lord Commander of the Nights Watch. Arya is finally invited to come to the House of Black and White by Jaqen H'ghar.\u2014Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil", "Arya arrives in Braavos and goes to the House of Black and White but is refused admittance. After several days, the man who refused her entry finds her living on the streets and takes her to the House where he reveals his true identity. In Mereen, one of the men killing the Unsullen is arrested and Daenerys orders that he stand trial. When the assassin killed, she has the murderer executed earning her the enmity of the slaves she has freed. Brienne finally comes across Sansa, who makes it clear she is not in need of protection. In Dorne, Ellaria Sand wants Doran Martell to seek revenge for the death of his brother. In King's Landing, Cersei takes charge of the small council and Jaime sets off for Dorne to collect Myrcella. At the Wall, the men of the Watch select a new commander.\u2014garykmcd", "Cersei makes more enemies by acting as unsanctioned regent on the vacant chair of the hand and making fickle appointments to the small council, alienating several capable ministers. Jaime hears from bitter Cersei that their illegitimate daughter Myrcella is in danger with her husband in Dorn, from where an anonymous threat was sent, and indeed Obryn's \"widow\" Ellaria Sand furiously presses his ruling brother Doran Martell, who wisely abhors needless violence and crazy risk, for bloody revenge. Jaime sails thereto on rescue mission and enlists the help of self-made knight Bronn, who just learned his bride won't inherit a castle. King Stannis offers Jon Snow the vassal rule of the North from Winterfell if he helps reconquer it with a Wildling army, with legitimization as Robb's Stark heir, but he sticks to his Watch oath for life. Jon feared hostile acting commander would easily beat in the election too old opponent Denys Mallister, but after Sam pleads Jon's recently proven leader skill, Snow wins by the vote of master Aemon. In Mereen, Dario's street skills manage to find and arrest the Harpy's Sons cult killer of Unsullied brothel clients Grey Worm couldn't find, but Daenerys keeps ignoring every plea for reason and orders the execution of overzealous Mossador who already killed him before she could give him a mock trial, which sparks massive uproar among the freed slaves as well. Podrick observation is dismissed that Brienne's vow to the late Catlyn is void now after Arya also Sansa bluntly refuses her \"protection,\" taking her cue from Petyr, who sends mounted guards to kill them, but they perish instead. Arriving in Braavos with nothing but the coin Jaq'n gave her, Arya heads for the House of Black and White and seems locked out without issue, until he transforms again. Last dragon Drogon visits Daenerys, but flies off again to terrorize the land.\u2014KGF Vissers", "Arya arrives in Braavos and is accepted into the \"House of Black and White\" by Jaqen H'ghar, who calls himself and his colleagues, \"no one\". Jaime recruits Bronn to travel to Dorne with him to retrieve Jaime's niece/daughter Myrcella, who is now betrothed to Trystane Martell, Prince Doran's son. Podrick recognises Littlefinger and Sansa in a tavern; Brienne offers Sansa her protection but is rebuffed. Littlefinger insists Brienne come with them, but she refuses and escapes with Podrick, then secretly follows Sansa. Stannis offers Jon legitimacy and lordship of Winterfell if he leaves the Night's Watch and supports him, but Jon keeps his vow to the Night's Watch; Samwell nominates Jon as Lord Commander against Alliser Thorne; Maester Aemon casts his ballot for Jon, breaking a tie vote. Daenerys incites a riot by executing a former slave who murdered a Sons of the Harpy prisoner prior to his trial.
