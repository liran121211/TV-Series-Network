Cersei:
<i>Myrcella is my only daughter.</i>

2
00:00:02,713 --> 00:00:05,214
Do you really think I'll let you
sell her like a common whore?

3
00:00:05,248 --> 00:00:07,183
Dorne is the safest
place for her.

4
00:00:07,217 --> 00:00:10,018
- You cannot stop it.
- No!

5
00:00:11,721 --> 00:00:13,488
( Groans )

6
00:00:15,458 --> 00:00:17,926

On behalf of the warlocks

( Crowd gasps )

11
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,038
It would be an honor to host you
at the House of the Undying,

12
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:34,207
Mother of Dragons.

13
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:36,377
Littlefinger: <i>Stannis will be here</i>
<i>in an hour.</i>

14
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:38,179
Renly's bannermen
will flock to him.

15
00:00:38,213 --> 00:00:40,081
Calling yourself king
doesn't make you one.

16
00:00:40,115 --> 00:00:42,817
And if Renly wasn't a king,
I wasn't a queen.

17
00:00:42,851 --> 00:00:46,120
- Do you want to be a queen?
- I want to be <i>the</i> queen.

18
00:00:46,155 --> 00:00:47,789
There on that mountain.

19
00:00:47,824 --> 00:00:50,392
We need to get rid
of those lookouts.

20
00:00:50,426 --> 00:00:52,627
I need to move fast
and silent.

21
00:00:52,662 --> 00:00:54,963
Lord Commander,
I'd like to join Lord Qhorin.

22
00:00:54,997 --> 00:00:56,231
Aye.

23
00:00:56,265 --> 00:00:57,733
Are you going
to kill Joffrey?

24
00:00:57,767 --> 00:00:59,835
- If the Gods give me strength.
- And then what?

25
00:00:59,869 --> 00:01:01,703
First we have to
win the war.

26
00:01:01,737 --> 00:01:03,539
You never told me
where you're from.

27
00:01:03,573 --> 00:01:05,107
<i>Volantis.</i>

28
00:01:05,141 --> 00:01:07,309
You're one of them now.
I should have let you burn.

29
00:01:07,344 --> 00:01:09,344
You saved me
and the two I was with.

30
00:01:09,379 --> 00:01:11,213
You stole three deaths
from the Red God.

31
00:01:11,247 --> 00:01:13,415
- Speak three names.
- I can name anyone?

32
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:15,684
- <i>And you'll kill him?</i>
- A man has said.

33
00:01:15,718 --> 00:01:18,219
Arya: <i>The one who tortures everyone.</i>
<i>They call him the Tickler.</i>

34
00:01:20,022 --> 00:01:22,289
Theon: The Stony Shore's not far
from Torrhen's Square.

35
00:01:22,324 --> 00:01:24,825
More impressive prize than
a few fisherman's daughters.

36
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:27,227
Soon as Winterfell got word that
we'd taken Torrhen's Square,

37
00:01:27,261 --> 00:01:29,596
the Starks would send
their men to take it back.

38
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,598
Take me to my ship.

39
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:34,301
Lord Stark, Torrhen's Square
is under siege.

40
00:01:34,335 --> 00:01:36,637
Torrhen's Square is barely
40 leagues from here.

41
00:01:36,672 --> 00:01:38,472
Go, Ser Rodrik.
Take the men you need.

Osha: <i>What did you see</i>

how to address your betters.

What do you want?

118
00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:27,557
I was brought here
a captive.

119
00:07:27,592 --> 00:07:29,960
You were here the day
I was taken.

120
00:07:29,994 --> 00:07:33,964
I'm the one who took you.
What of it?

121
00:07:33,998 --> 00:07:36,700
Let me serve you.

00:07:36,735 --> 00:07:39,336
Theon:
<i>Serve me how?</i>

123
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,838
I need fighters,
not kitchen sluts.

124
00:07:41,872 --> 00:07:44,874
It was Robb Stark who
put me in the kitchens.

125
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:47,444
Put a spear
in my hand again.

126
00:07:47,478 --> 00:07:49,546
So you can bury it
in my neck?

127
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,148
Do you take me
for a fool?

128
00:07:51,182 --> 00:07:52,616
Get up.

129
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:55,719

130
00:07:55,754 --> 00:07:58,021

131
00:07:58,056 --> 00:08:01,492
It's your dream,
little Lord.

132
00:08:01,527 --> 00:08:04,963
The ocean has come
to swallow this place.

133
00:08:04,997 --> 00:08:07,933
I ain't letting it
drown me.

134
00:08:07,967 --> 00:08:10,769

- Rodrik: <i>Greyjoy!</i>

<i>done to him?</i>

We caught this one on this way
back from Torrhen's Square.

137
00:08:21,013 --> 00:08:23,948
Took out two of ours
before I got his sword.

138
00:08:23,982 --> 00:08:27,418
Ser Rodrik, it grieves me that
we meet as foes.

139
00:08:27,452 --> 00:08:31,289
It grieves me you've less honor
than a back alley whore.

140
00:08:31,323 --> 00:08:34,792
You were raised here
under this roof.

141
00:08:34,826 --> 00:08:37,495
- These people are your people.
- They are not my people.

142
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,731
King Robb thought of you
as a brother.

143
00:08:39,766 --> 00:08:42,701
My brothers are dead.

144
00:08:42,735 --> 00:08:45,504
They died fighting
Stark men, men like you.

145
00:08:45,538 --> 00:08:48,974
Aye, they died fighting
a war your father started.

146
00:08:49,008 --> 00:08:51,243
Lord Stark raised you
among his own sons.

147
00:08:51,277 --> 00:08:53,411
Among them,
but not one of them.

148
00:08:53,445 --> 00:08:56,247
I was his hostage
taken from my home.

149
00:08:56,281 --> 00:08:57,982
If he were alive
to see this--

150
00:08:58,016 --> 00:08:59,851
He's not.
He's dead.

151
00:08:59,885 --> 00:09:01,953
The Seven Kingdoms
are at war.

152
00:09:01,987 --> 00:09:04,255
And Winterfell is mine.

153
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,958
I should have put
a sword in your belly

154
00:09:06,992 --> 00:09:08,526
instead of
in your hand.

155
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,662
You've served this House
faithfully, old man.

156
00:09:11,697 --> 00:09:13,765
But keep talking
and I'll--

157
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:15,600
( grunts )

158
00:09:15,634 --> 00:09:18,603
Take him to the cells.
Lock him up--

My prince,

160
00:09:20,373 --> 00:09:22,941
you cannot let that stand.
He must pay.

161
00:09:22,976 --> 00:09:24,876
I'll lock him in a cell
until he rots--

162
00:09:24,911 --> 00:09:27,913
No, he has to pay
the iron price.

163
00:09:27,947 --> 00:09:31,050

you while he lives.

I sentence you to death.

167

No! You said no harm
would come to them if I yielded.

168

The old man couldn't
keep his mouth shut.

169
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,648
I urge you not to make
a hasty decision.

170
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:03,652
He disrespected me
in front of my men.

171
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,153
That was his decision,
not mine.

172
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:07,655
He is worth more
to you alive than dead.

173
00:10:07,991 --> 00:10:10,992
The Starks will pay.

174
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,862
Please, Theon,

175
00:10:13,896 --> 00:10:15,830
think what you do.

176
00:10:26,474 --> 00:10:28,374
You'll address me
as Prince Theon

177
00:10:28,409 --> 00:10:30,309
or you'll be next.

178
00:10:30,344 --> 00:10:32,311
Come.

179
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,747
No!

180
00:10:34,782 --> 00:10:37,983
- No!
- Bran: <i>Theon!</i>

181
00:10:38,852 --> 00:10:40,920
Please!

182
00:10:40,954 --> 00:10:42,822
Ser Rodrik!

183
00:10:42,857 --> 00:10:45,692
He who passes the sentence
should swing the sword.

184
00:10:45,726 --> 00:10:48,495
- Bran: <i>I'm begging you!</i>
- Coward.

185
00:10:51,265 --> 00:10:54,367
Stop! Stop right now!

186
00:10:54,402 --> 00:10:56,136
You don't give commands anymore,
little Lord.

187
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:58,838
- Please, stop this. Please stop him.
- Rodrik: <i>Hush now, child.</i>

188
00:10:58,873 --> 00:11:01,975
I'm off to see your father.

189
00:11:04,111 --> 00:11:06,980
Bran: You said no harm
would come!

190
00:11:07,014 --> 00:11:09,749
<i>You said no harm would come.</i>
<i>Theon, please.</i>

191
00:11:09,784 --> 00:11:12,586
Any last words, old man?

192
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:15,522
Gods help you,
Theon Greyjoy.

193
00:11:15,557 --> 00:11:17,657
Now you are truly lost.

194
00:11:17,691 --> 00:11:20,127
Bran:
<i>Theon, please, don't.</i>

195
00:11:20,161 --> 00:11:23,263
- Rickon: <i>Do something.</i>
- Bran: <i>I'll do anything. Please!</i>

196
00:11:23,297 --> 00:11:24,932
Rickon:
<i>No, please, stop it!</i>

197
00:11:24,966 --> 00:11:26,533
- ( Grunts )
- ( Screams )

198
00:11:36,144 --> 00:11:39,313
- <i>( Bran wailing )</i>
- <i>( Thunder rumbling )</i>

199
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:43,351
( Panting )

200
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,258
( Wind howling )

201
00:11:56,366 --> 00:11:58,768
Jon:
Ghost, stay with us.

202
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:00,869
Ghost!

203
00:12:00,904 --> 00:12:02,538
There goes your pet.

204
00:12:02,572 --> 00:12:04,139
Jon:
<i>He's not a pet.</i>

205
00:12:04,174 --> 00:12:06,675
Qhorin: <i>You're right,</i>
<i>he's not.</i>

206
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:09,278
You can't tame
a wild thing.

207
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:11,079
You can't trust
a wild thing.

208
00:12:11,114 --> 00:12:14,149
- Ghost is different.
- So you think.

209
00:12:14,183 --> 00:12:16,551
Wild creatures
have their own rules,

210
00:12:16,586 --> 00:12:18,753
their own reasons.

211
00:12:18,788 --> 00:12:20,756
And you'll never
know them.

212
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:24,459
Now the wildlings
we're looking for

213
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,895
sleep during the day
and hunt at night.

214
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,900
I thought you said
you couldn't know wild things.

215
00:12:31,934 --> 00:12:33,835
I said you can't.

216
00:12:33,869 --> 00:12:36,905
They find a nice cave
to hide in while the sun's up

217
00:12:36,939 --> 00:12:38,873
and do their killing
when it's dark.

218
00:12:38,908 --> 00:12:41,943
- We could do the same.
- No, we couldn't.

219
00:12:41,978 --> 00:12:44,179
This is their country.

220
00:12:44,213 --> 00:12:47,249
They know where to walk,
where not to walk.

221
00:12:47,284 --> 00:12:49,185
I've lost good men
who fell into a crevasse

222
00:12:49,219 --> 00:12:51,354
they didn't see
till they were in it.

223
00:12:52,489 --> 00:12:54,958
My father always said
I'm of the North.

224
00:12:54,992 --> 00:12:56,759
( Chuckles )

225
00:12:56,793 --> 00:12:59,662
- I wasn't joking.
- Look around, boy.

226
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:02,932
This look like
home to you?

227
00:13:02,966 --> 00:13:06,169
You start thinking
you know this place, it'll kill you.

228
00:13:07,237 --> 00:13:09,505
You understand me?

229
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,974
No, you don't.

230
00:13:12,008 --> 00:13:13,942
We're at war.

231
00:13:13,977 --> 00:13:15,644
We've always been at war.

232
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:18,213
It's never going to end 'cause
we're not fighting an enemy.

233
00:13:18,248 --> 00:13:21,817
We're fighting the North
and it's not going anywhere.

234
00:13:21,851 --> 00:13:24,853
The Watch has given
you a great gift.

235
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,422
You only have one thing
to give in return--

236
00:13:27,457 --> 00:13:28,890
your life.

237
00:13:28,924 --> 00:13:30,258
I'll gladly give my life.

238
00:13:30,292 --> 00:13:32,660
I don't want you
to be glad about it.

239
00:13:32,695 --> 00:13:34,695
I want you to curse
and fight

240
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,164
until your heart's
done pumping.

241
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:39,634
And know this, boy--

242
00:13:39,668 --> 00:13:43,370
your death will be a gift
for them south of the Wall.

243
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,605
They'll never know
what you've done.

244
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:47,140
They'll never know
how you died.

245
00:13:47,174 --> 00:13:49,275
They won't even
know your damn name,

246
00:13:49,309 --> 00:13:52,211
but they'll be alive because
some nameless bastard

247
00:13:52,245 --> 00:13:55,882
north of the Wall
gave his life for theirs.

248
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:59,051
Now, do you understand me?

249
00:13:59,086 --> 00:14:00,820
I do.

250
00:14:00,854 --> 00:14:03,222
You're even dumber
than you look.

251
00:14:04,425 --> 00:14:06,492
It's just words, boy,

252
00:14:06,527 --> 00:14:08,494
to keep us a little
warmer in the night,

253
00:14:08,528 --> 00:14:11,765
make us feel like
we've got a purpose.

254
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:14,234
( Laughs )
Come on.

255
00:14:14,268 --> 00:14:16,603
We've got to find these
goat fuckers before night falls

256
00:14:16,628 --> 00:14:18,217
and they find us.

257
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:32,455
- Can you read?
- My Lord?

258
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:35,525
Can you read?

259
00:14:38,296 --> 00:14:41,597
This letter detailing
our infantry movements

260
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:44,300
was meant for Lord Damon
of House Marbrand.

261
00:14:44,335 --> 00:14:48,138
It was sent to Lord Marlyn
of House Dormand.

262
00:14:48,172 --> 00:14:50,173
My apologies, My Lord.
I must have--

263
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:53,744
Girl, fetch me the "History of the
Greater and the Lesser Houses."

264
00:14:53,778 --> 00:14:56,547
It's the one on the--
( Chuckles )

265
00:14:59,518 --> 00:15:02,520
My cupbearer can read
better than you.

266
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:14,899
To whom does House Dormand
owe allegiance?

267
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:19,336
My Lord, I--

268
00:15:19,371 --> 00:15:22,173
To the Starks
of Winterfell!

269
00:15:22,207 --> 00:15:26,410
Who have 20,000 men
and my son!

270
00:15:27,846 --> 00:15:29,947
I judged you might be
good for something more

271
00:15:29,981 --> 00:15:32,549
than brutalizing peasants.

272
00:15:32,584 --> 00:15:34,951
I see I overestimated you.

273
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:39,823
<i>If you ever put my son's</i>
<i>life at risk again, I'll...</i>

274
00:15:39,857 --> 00:15:42,358
Leave us.

275
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:51,767
Put the book away, girl.

276
00:15:51,802 --> 00:15:54,436
<i>( Door opens )</i>

277
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:57,005
<i>( Door closes )</i>

278
00:15:58,641 --> 00:16:02,277
Maybe you should devise our next
battle plan while you're about it.

279
00:16:02,311 --> 00:16:04,312
<i>( Knocking )</i>

280
00:16:04,346 --> 00:16:06,948
<i>( Door opens )</i>

281
00:16:08,255 --> 00:16:10,473
- Lord Petyr Baelish.
- Hmmm.

282
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,455
Give us the room.

283
00:16:21,131 --> 00:16:22,966
Clear all this.

284
00:16:26,104 --> 00:16:28,906
- Lord Tywin.
- Baelish.

285
00:16:36,981 --> 00:16:39,749
- Wine?
- Thank you.

286
00:16:42,653 --> 00:16:44,587
What news
from the capital?

287
00:16:44,621 --> 00:16:48,023
I travelled here directly
from Renly Baratheon's camp.

288
00:16:48,058 --> 00:16:50,225
Ah, the late king Renly.

289
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,461
Rather a short reign.

290
00:16:52,496 --> 00:16:54,497
Murdered by a woman,
I hear.

291
00:16:54,532 --> 00:16:56,466
So they say.

292
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:01,639
There has been talk
of other forces at work,

293
00:17:01,674 --> 00:17:04,108
dark forces.

294
00:17:04,143 --> 00:17:06,545
Here.

295
00:17:08,514 --> 00:17:10,950
( Scoffs )
Men love to blame demons

296
00:17:10,984 --> 00:17:14,720
when their grand plans
unravel.

297
00:17:14,754 --> 00:17:17,556
It is my belief
that a moment of chaos

298
00:17:17,591 --> 00:17:19,992
affords opportunities
lost soon after.

299
00:17:20,026 --> 00:17:23,162
You say that as if you were
the first man alive to think it.

300
00:17:23,196 --> 00:17:26,331
Yes, a crisis
is an opportunity.

301
00:17:26,365 --> 00:17:28,833
What other brilliant insights
have you brought me today?

302
00:17:28,867 --> 00:17:30,568
After the Lannisters
and the Starks,

303
00:17:30,602 --> 00:17:33,037
the Tyrells command
the largest host.

304
00:17:33,072 --> 00:17:35,207
Their lands are the most
fertile in the Seven Kingdoms,

305
00:17:35,241 --> 00:17:39,177
- feeding horses and soldiers.
- Yes, yes, yes.

306
00:17:39,212 --> 00:17:43,616
The Tyrells have not yet declared
for any of the surviving kings.

307
00:17:43,651 --> 00:17:46,820
Loras wants revenge. He blames
Stannis for Renly's death.

308
00:17:46,854 --> 00:17:49,523
And Margaery--

309
00:17:49,557 --> 00:17:51,326
Wants to be queen.

310
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,161
Yes, she does.

311
00:17:55,463 --> 00:17:59,234
House Tyrell rebelled
against the Iron Throne,

312
00:17:59,268 --> 00:18:02,838
- against my grandson.
- They did.

313
00:18:02,872 --> 00:18:05,207
And perhaps that treason
should be punished

314
00:18:05,241 --> 00:18:07,143
<i>one day,</i>

315
00:18:07,177 --> 00:18:11,146
after Stannis and Robb Stark
are defeated.

316
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:15,751
More wine for Lord Baelish.

317
00:18:21,858 --> 00:18:25,127
If you will allow me to represent
your family's interests,

318
00:18:25,161 --> 00:18:27,228
I believe that an advantageous
agreement--

319
00:18:27,263 --> 00:18:30,331
The Tyrell host has
returned to Highgarden?

320
00:18:30,366 --> 00:18:32,533
They have.

321
00:18:32,568 --> 00:18:34,468
Pardon, My Lord.

322
00:18:34,503 --> 00:18:36,437
It's only wine.

323
00:18:37,806 --> 00:18:39,940
You would ride
there yourself?

324
00:18:39,974 --> 00:18:41,875
Tonight, with your leave.

325
00:18:41,909 --> 00:18:44,143
I'll have an answer
by nightfall.

326
00:18:44,178 --> 00:18:45,845
That'll be all, girl.

327
00:18:51,451 --> 00:18:52,986
What else?

328
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,154
On your son
Tyrion's directive,

329
00:18:55,189 --> 00:18:57,690
I met with Catelyn Stark.

330
00:18:57,725 --> 00:18:59,225
Why?

331
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,762
Littlefinger: <i>He had an interesting</i>
<i>proposal for her</i>

332
00:19:01,796 --> 00:19:04,999
- concerning her daughters.
- Hmm.

333
00:19:33,527 --> 00:19:35,862
- ( Groans )
- ( Shouting )

334
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:57,418
- A girl.
- A wildling.

335
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,854
We could question her.

336
00:19:59,888 --> 00:20:01,856
You could.

337
00:20:01,891 --> 00:20:03,491
She won't answer.

338
00:20:03,526 --> 00:20:06,995
I've known a wildling to bite off
his tongue instead of talking.

339
00:20:08,431 --> 00:20:11,232
- What's your name?
- Ygritte.

340
00:20:11,267 --> 00:20:14,335
She was reaching for this axe
when you got to her.

341
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:18,106
Give her half a chance,
she'll bury it in your face.

342
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,942
I gave you my name.

343
00:20:22,044 --> 00:20:24,712
I'm Jon Snow.

344
00:20:31,185 --> 00:20:33,120
You ought to burn
them you killed.

345
00:20:33,155 --> 00:20:35,823
Qhorin: <i>We'd need a big</i>
<i>fire for that.</i>

346
00:20:35,857 --> 00:20:39,861
Tell me, Ygritte,

347
00:20:39,895 --> 00:20:41,930
why do you want us
to build a big fire?

348
00:20:41,964 --> 00:20:45,201
Are there some more
friends in the area?

349
00:20:45,235 --> 00:20:48,571
Burn them or maybe you'll
need those swords again.

350
00:20:48,606 --> 00:20:51,141
Our boy here's already
killed one dead man.

351
00:20:51,175 --> 00:20:53,576
He can do it again
if he has to.

352
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:56,178
What waits
beyond the pass?

353
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,247
- The free folk.
- How many?

354
00:20:58,282 --> 00:21:00,149
( Chuckles )

355
00:21:00,183 --> 00:21:02,117
Hundreds and thousands.

356
00:21:02,152 --> 00:21:04,687
More than you've
ever seen, crow.

357
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:08,123
Why come to the mountains?

358
00:21:08,158 --> 00:21:11,094
What's in the Frostfangs
your king could want?

359
00:21:18,836 --> 00:21:21,038
Do you mean to march
on the Wall?

360
00:21:27,112 --> 00:21:29,281
Do you know
who I am, girl?

361
00:21:29,315 --> 00:21:31,817
Qhorin Halfhand.

362
00:21:31,851 --> 00:21:33,351
Tell me true.

363
00:21:33,386 --> 00:21:36,655
If your people captured me,

364
00:21:36,689 --> 00:21:38,657
would they take me prisoner?

365
00:21:38,691 --> 00:21:40,859
They'd take your head
off your shoulders

366
00:21:40,893 --> 00:21:42,995
if they was feeling kind.

367
00:21:43,029 --> 00:21:45,631
If not,
they'd kill you slow.

368
00:21:45,665 --> 00:21:48,266
( Sighs )

369
00:21:48,301 --> 00:21:50,669
We have no food for her.

370
00:21:50,703 --> 00:21:53,037
Can't spare a man
to watch her.

371
00:21:53,072 --> 00:21:56,307
Can't let her go. She'll bring
Mance Rayder's army down on us.

372
00:21:56,341 --> 00:21:58,275
It needs to be done.

373
00:21:58,309 --> 00:22:00,810
- Want me to do it?
- No.

374
00:22:00,845 --> 00:22:03,179
No, I'll do it.

375
00:22:04,815 --> 00:22:06,882
Come, brothers.

376
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:09,017
We'll leave him to it.

377
00:22:09,051 --> 00:22:11,052
We'll meet you
at the top.

378
00:22:11,087 --> 00:22:12,588
Don't take too long.

379
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:14,256
We're deep in
their country now.

380
00:22:19,462 --> 00:22:22,331
<i>( Bird screeches )</i>

381
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:30,773
You never killed
a woman before, did you?

382
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:33,609
You don't need
to do it.

383
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:35,845
Mance would take you.
I know he would.

384
00:22:35,879 --> 00:22:38,281
There's secret ways.

385
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:41,551
The crows would
never catch us.

386
00:22:41,586 --> 00:22:44,754
I'm as much a crow
as they are.

387
00:22:56,534 --> 00:22:58,602
Will you burn me...

388
00:22:58,636 --> 00:23:00,637
after?

389
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:03,173
Can't.

390
00:23:03,207 --> 00:23:05,675
Someone might
see the smoke.

391
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,684
Strike hard and true,

392
00:23:13,718 --> 00:23:15,919
Jon Snow,

393
00:23:15,954 --> 00:23:18,456
or I'll come back
and haunt you.

394
00:23:22,294 --> 00:23:25,230
That's cold.

395
00:23:27,433 --> 00:23:28,967
Go on.

396
00:23:29,002 --> 00:23:31,103
Be quick about it.

397
00:23:38,378 --> 00:23:39,878
Do it.

398
00:23:43,182 --> 00:23:45,249

You can't do it.
We both know it.

405

The sun's going
down, Jon Snow.

406
00:25:11,102 --> 00:25:14,238
And your friends
are nowhere close.

407
00:25:14,272 --> 00:25:15,639
I'll find them.

408
00:25:15,673 --> 00:25:19,342
Call for the

You sound like a little cat mewling

Princes don't cry.

- I saw you cry.
- Did you say something, My Lady?

428

00:31:35,753 --> 00:31:37,887
He makes everyone wait.

522
00:31:37,922 --> 00:31:41,157
Of course, you could have
avoided this embarrassment

523
00:31:41,192 --> 00:31:43,660
if you married
the wealthiest man in Qarth.

524
00:31:43,694 --> 00:31:45,729
I already have a husband.

525
00:31:45,763 --> 00:31:48,098
Khal Drogo is gone,
Khaleesi.

526
00:31:48,132 --> 00:31:52,002
You are far too young
to be a widow forever

527
00:31:52,037 --> 00:31:54,338
and far too beautiful.

528
00:31:54,373 --> 00:31:56,140
And you are far too smart

529
00:31:56,174 --> 00:31:59,643
to think that I will
succumb to flattery.

530
00:31:59,678 --> 00:32:01,612
I have travelled
very far in my life

531
00:32:01,647 --> 00:32:03,348
and met many women,

532
00:32:03,382 --> 00:32:05,183
but none that are
immune to flattery.

533
00:32:05,217 --> 00:32:07,919
- <i>The Mother of Dragons!</i>
- Ah.

534
00:32:07,954 --> 00:32:09,954
Here he comes.

535
00:32:09,989 --> 00:32:13,591
Forgive me. I had terrible
dreams last night.

536
00:32:13,626 --> 00:32:15,260
Terrible dreams.

537
00:32:15,294 --> 00:32:18,463
I could not sleep
until the sun was shining

538
00:32:18,497 --> 00:32:20,999
and the birds were singing.

539
00:32:21,033 --> 00:32:23,768
<i>Look what a beauty you are</i>

540
00:32:23,802 --> 00:32:26,370
<i>now the Red Waste</i>
<i>has been washed off you.</i>

541
00:32:26,405 --> 00:32:29,740
I am sorry about
all that unpleasantness.

542
00:32:29,774 --> 00:32:34,244
The silver hair
of a true Targaryen.

543
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:37,715
Xaro Xhoan Daxos,
she is far too lovely

544
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:40,285
for a glorified
dockworker like yourself.

545
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:43,855
Very true, and yet they say
that your grandfather,

546
00:32:43,889 --> 00:32:45,957
who sold pepper
off the back of a wagon,

547
00:32:45,992 --> 00:32:49,394
married a lady far lovelier
and higher born than himself.

548
00:32:49,429 --> 00:32:51,662
Every lady alive
was lovelier

549
00:32:51,697 --> 00:32:53,931
and higher born
than my grandfather.

550
00:32:53,966 --> 00:32:55,799
- ( Laughs )
- Daenerys: <i>Ahem.</i>

551
00:32:55,834 --> 00:32:59,369
Did my servants not offer you
something to eat, to drink?

552
00:32:59,404 --> 00:33:01,338
I'll have them flogged
in the square.

553
00:33:01,372 --> 00:33:03,306
Thank you, My Lord.
You are a gracious host,

554
00:33:03,341 --> 00:33:06,242
but there is no servant alive
that can bring me what I want.

555
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:09,078
Oh, she has a talent
for drama, this one.

556
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:13,216
So, my little princess,
what is it you want?

557
00:33:13,284 --> 00:33:14,684
My birthright--

558
00:33:14,719 --> 00:33:16,620
the Seven Kingdoms
of Westeros.

559
00:33:16,654 --> 00:33:19,323
I fear I'm no better than
a servant in this regard.

560
00:33:19,357 --> 00:33:21,425
I cannot give you
what I do not have.

561
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:24,062
I'm not asking you
for the Kingdoms.

562
00:33:24,096 --> 00:33:25,864
I'm asking you
for ships.

563
00:33:25,898 --> 00:33:27,533
I need to cross
the Narrow Sea.

564
00:33:27,567 --> 00:33:29,435
I need my ships as well.

565
00:33:29,469 --> 00:33:30,936
I use them, you see,

566
00:33:30,971 --> 00:33:33,439
to bring spices from
one port to another.

567
00:33:33,473 --> 00:33:34,973
Whatever you grant me
now will be repaid

568
00:33:35,008 --> 00:33:37,777
three times over when
I retake the Iron Throne.

569
00:33:37,811 --> 00:33:39,245
Retake?

570
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,413
Did you once sit
on the Iron Throne?

571
00:33:41,448 --> 00:33:44,283
My father sat there
before he was murdered.

572
00:33:44,317 --> 00:33:46,685
But if you did not
sit on it yourself,

573
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,156
would it not be correct
to say take the Iron Throne?

574
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:52,224
I didn't come here
to argue grammar.

575
00:33:52,258 --> 00:33:55,127
Of course not.
You came to take my ships.

576
00:33:55,161 --> 00:33:57,729
So let me explain
my position,

577
00:33:57,764 --> 00:33:59,698
little princess.

578
00:33:59,733 --> 00:34:03,201
Unlike you, I do not
have exalted ancestors.

579
00:34:03,236 --> 00:34:05,204
I make my living by trade.

580
00:34:05,238 --> 00:34:08,573
And I judge every trade
on its merits.

581
00:34:08,608 --> 00:34:10,241
You ask for ships.

582
00:34:10,276 --> 00:34:13,311
You say I shall be
repaid triple.

583
00:34:13,345 --> 00:34:16,147
I do not doubt your honesty
or your intentions.

584
00:34:16,181 --> 00:34:18,416
But before you
repay your debts,

585
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:21,051
you must seize
the Seven Kingdoms.

586
00:34:21,086 --> 00:34:23,753
- Do you have an army?
- Not yet.

587
00:34:23,788 --> 00:34:25,255
You do not have an army.

588
00:34:25,289 --> 00:34:27,390
Do you have powerful
allies in Westeros?

589
00:34:27,425 --> 00:34:29,559
There are many there
that support my claim.

590
00:34:29,594 --> 00:34:31,061
When were you
there last?

591
00:34:32,063 --> 00:34:33,697
I left when
I was a baby.

592
00:34:33,732 --> 00:34:36,634
So, in truth,
you have no allies.

593
00:34:36,669 --> 00:34:39,424
The people will rise
to fight for their rightful

594
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:41,139
Queen when I return.

595
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:43,008
Ah.

596
00:34:43,042 --> 00:34:44,810
Forgive me,
little princess,

597
00:34:44,844 --> 00:34:48,281
but I cannot make an investment
based on wishes and dreams.

598
00:34:48,315 --> 00:34:49,782
Now if you'll pardon me.

599
00:34:49,817 --> 00:34:52,518
Do you know Illyrio Mopatis,
Magister of Pentos?

600
00:34:52,553 --> 00:34:55,188
Yes, we've met.
A shrewd man.

601
00:34:55,222 --> 00:34:58,824
For my wedding he gave me
three petrified dragon eggs.

602
00:34:58,859 --> 00:35:01,727
<i>He believed--</i>
<i>the world believed--</i>

603
00:35:01,761 --> 00:35:03,695
that the ages
had turned them to stone.

604
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:06,932
How many centuries has it been
since dragons roamed the skies?

605
00:35:06,966 --> 00:35:09,934
But I dreamt that
if I carried those eggs

606
00:35:09,968 --> 00:35:12,437
into a great fire,
they would hatch.

607
00:35:12,471 --> 00:35:17,009
When I stepped into the fire,
my own people thought I was mad.

608
00:35:17,043 --> 00:35:19,211
But when the fire
burned out,

609
00:35:19,246 --> 00:35:21,447
I was unhurt,

610
00:35:21,481 --> 00:35:24,317
the Mother of Dragons.

611
00:35:26,887 --> 00:35:29,155
Do you understand?

612
00:35:31,726 --> 00:35:34,294
I'm no ordinary woman.

613
00:35:34,328 --> 00:35:37,296
My dreams come true.

614
00:35:42,069 --> 00:35:44,336
I admire your passion.

615
00:35:45,938 --> 00:35:49,241
But in business, I trust
in logic, not passion.

616
00:35:49,275 --> 00:35:50,942
I'm sorry, little princess.

617
00:35:50,976 --> 00:35:53,311
I am not
your little princess.

618
00:35:53,345 --> 00:35:56,381
I am Daenerys Stormborn
of the blood of old Valyria

619
00:35:56,415 --> 00:35:58,417
and I will take
what is mine.

620
00:35:58,451 --> 00:36:01,553
With fire and blood,
I will take it.

621
00:36:01,587 --> 00:36:05,157
Yes, My Lady,
but not with my ships.

622
00:36:22,574 --> 00:36:25,710
Who taught you to read?

623
00:36:25,744 --> 00:36:28,012
My father, My Lord.

624
00:36:28,047 --> 00:36:30,015
Hmm.

625
00:36:30,049 --> 00:36:32,250
I taught my son
Jaime to read.

626
00:36:35,254 --> 00:36:37,255
The Maester came
to me one day,

627
00:36:37,289 --> 00:36:39,457
told me he wasn't learning.

628
00:36:39,492 --> 00:36:42,260
He couldn't make sense
of the letters.

629
00:36:42,295 --> 00:36:44,997
He reversed them
in his head.

630
00:36:45,031 --> 00:36:47,867
The Maester said he'd heard
tell of this affliction

631
00:36:47,901 --> 00:36:49,936
and that we simply
must accept it.

632
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:52,038
Ha!

633
00:36:52,073 --> 00:36:55,542
After that,
I sat Jaime down

634
00:36:55,577 --> 00:36:58,746
for four hours every day
until he learned.

635
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:03,985
He hated me for it,
for a time.

636
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,655
For a long time,

637
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:08,524
but he learned.

638
00:37:13,296 --> 00:37:16,398
Where is your father?
Is he alive?

639
00:37:19,368 --> 00:37:20,902
Who was he?

640
00:37:20,936 --> 00:37:23,538
A stonemason.

641
00:37:23,572 --> 00:37:25,872
A stonemason
who could read?

642
00:37:25,907 --> 00:37:28,308
- Hmm.
- He taught himself.

643
00:37:28,342 --> 00:37:31,077
Quite a man.

644
00:37:32,112 --> 00:37:34,414
What killed him?

645
00:37:36,016 --> 00:37:38,150
Loyalty.

646
00:37:39,687 --> 00:37:41,855
You're a sharp
little thing, aren't you?

647
00:37:45,226 --> 00:37:46,526
Did...

648
00:37:48,329 --> 00:37:51,665
Forgive me, My Lord.
I shouldn't ask questions.

649
00:37:52,668 --> 00:37:54,935
No...

650
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:57,872
But you've already begun.

651
00:37:57,906 --> 00:38:01,342
Did you know
your father, My Lord?

652
00:38:01,376 --> 00:38:03,511
I did.

653
00:38:04,947 --> 00:38:06,715
I grew up with him.

654
00:38:08,651 --> 00:38:11,587
I watched him
grow old.

655
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:16,860
<i>He loved us.</i>

656
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:19,696
He was a good man,

657
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:22,432
but a weak man,

658
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:25,969
a weak man who nearly destroyed
our House and name.

659
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,374
I'm cold.

660
00:38:30,409 --> 00:38:33,110
I'll fetch more wood
for the fire, My Lord.

661
00:38:33,145 --> 00:38:35,513
Mmm.

662
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:40,350
( Horse whinnies )

663
00:38:59,304 --> 00:39:01,939
( Grunts )

664
00:39:01,974 --> 00:39:03,641
Where are you going, girl?

665
00:39:03,676 --> 00:39:06,611
The armory,
My Lord.

666
00:39:06,646 --> 00:39:08,247
Why?

667
00:39:08,281 --> 00:39:10,115
Lord Tywin sent me.

668
00:39:12,085 --> 00:39:14,353
What might this be?

669
00:39:14,387 --> 00:39:17,289
Lord Tywin gave it to me.

670
00:39:17,323 --> 00:39:19,391
What for?

671
00:39:19,425 --> 00:39:22,260
To take to the armory.

672
00:39:22,295 --> 00:39:24,796
Why would he do that?

673
00:39:26,766 --> 00:39:28,400
Let's go and ask him.

674
00:39:31,003 --> 00:39:33,305
Move!

675
00:39:34,807 --> 00:39:37,276
Get out of the way!

676
00:39:50,458 --> 00:39:53,727
( Men chatting )

677
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,874
Amory Lorch.

678
00:40:08,908 --> 00:40:10,909
A girl has named
a second name.

679
00:40:10,944 --> 00:40:12,511
A man will do
what must be done.

680
00:40:12,545 --> 00:40:14,480
Now!

681
00:40:14,514 --> 00:40:18,384
A girl cannot tell a man when
exactly he must do a thing.

682
00:40:18,419 --> 00:40:20,687
A man cannot make a thing
happen before its time.

683
00:40:20,721 --> 00:40:22,656
But he's going to tell Tywin.
He's getting away.

684
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:25,692
- It has to be now.
- ( Sighs )

685
00:40:32,868 --> 00:40:34,968
Guard!

686
00:40:39,173 --> 00:40:41,642
<i>( Horse whinnies )</i>

687
00:40:44,245 --> 00:40:46,579
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

688
00:40:50,451 --> 00:40:52,985
My honor, Your Grace.

689
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:55,454
Your Grace.

690
00:41:00,527 --> 00:41:03,061
- Your Grace.
- Quent.

691
00:41:24,018 --> 00:41:25,885
Lady Talisa.

692
00:41:26,887 --> 00:41:28,488
Your Grace.

693
00:41:30,258 --> 00:41:32,059
I'm not sure I'm a lady.

694
00:41:32,093 --> 00:41:34,227
Westerosi customs are still
a bit foreign to me.

695
00:41:34,262 --> 00:41:36,663
It's hard to keep
all the rules straight.

696
00:41:36,697 --> 00:41:39,799
But if I remember
my lessons,

697
00:41:39,834 --> 00:41:42,368
a woman of noble birth
is always called a lady

698
00:41:42,403 --> 00:41:44,903
unless she's a queen
or a princess.

699
00:41:44,938 --> 00:41:47,138
I could find
someone who knows.

700
00:41:47,173 --> 00:41:49,741
Why are you so sure
I'm of noble birth?

701
00:41:49,775 --> 00:41:51,809
Because it's obvious.

702
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:55,479
What if I told you my father
sold lace on the long bridge

703
00:41:55,514 --> 00:41:58,449
and my mother, my brother, and I lived
with him above our shop?

704
00:41:59,951 --> 00:42:01,318
I'd call you a liar.

705
00:42:01,353 --> 00:42:04,755
Not very noble to accuse
a lady of dishonesty.

706
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:10,894
I always thought
I was a brilliant liar.

707
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:14,297
Better at amputations,
I'm afraid.

708
00:42:19,402 --> 00:42:20,970
Quite a pretty spot.

709
00:42:21,004 --> 00:42:23,639
Will we be here long?

710
00:42:23,673 --> 00:42:26,408
I couldn't really discuss
troop movements with you.

711
00:42:26,442 --> 00:42:28,877
I'm not a spy.

712
00:42:28,911 --> 00:42:31,979
Of course a spy
would deny being a spy.

713
00:42:33,282 --> 00:42:35,817
You're right.
You've found me out.

714
00:42:35,851 --> 00:42:37,585
I'm writing a letter
to the Lannisters.

715
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:40,055
"The Young Wolf
is on the move."

716
00:42:41,958 --> 00:42:43,793
Perhaps you'd join me...

717
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:48,098
If you've got time,
of course, for, well...

718
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:50,434
Robb.

719
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:53,737
Mother.

720
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:02,379
Mother, this is
Lady Talisa.

721
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,681
She's been helping
with the wounded.

722
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:07,617
She's been very...
helpful.

723
00:43:07,651 --> 00:43:09,185
Lady Talisa.

724
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:10,886
Lady Stark.

725
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,754
Lady Talisa...?

726
00:43:12,789 --> 00:43:16,358
- Maegyr.
- Maegyr?

727
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:19,328
Forgive me,
I do not know this name.

728
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:22,432
An uncommon name here.
An old name in Volantis.

729
00:43:23,501 --> 00:43:26,637
Excuse me, My Lady.
Your Grace.

730
00:43:35,214 --> 00:43:36,882
I've missed you.

731
00:43:36,916 --> 00:43:40,319
Yes, you look
positively forlorn.

732
00:43:40,353 --> 00:43:43,188
You surprised me,
that's all.

733
00:43:43,223 --> 00:43:46,392
I didn't think
I'd see you today.

734
00:43:46,426 --> 00:43:48,794
I wish that you were free
to follow your heart.

735
00:43:48,829 --> 00:43:50,262
I know.

736
00:43:50,297 --> 00:43:52,965
You have inherited your
father's responsibilities.

737
00:43:52,999 --> 00:43:55,801
I'm afraid they come
at a cost.

738
00:43:55,835 --> 00:43:59,238
- I know.
- You are promised to another--

739
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:03,742
a debt that must be paid.

740
00:44:03,777 --> 00:44:06,145
- I haven't forgotten.
- Your Grace.

741
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:09,916
My Lady.
News from Winterfell.

742
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:11,884
( Wind howling )

743
00:44:22,296 --> 00:44:25,098
Your brothers desert you?

744
00:44:25,132 --> 00:44:27,366
I can tell you
which way to go.

745
00:44:27,401 --> 00:44:30,036
We'll stop here.

746
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:32,038
Too dark to go
any farther today.

747
00:44:32,072 --> 00:44:34,974
Here? There's no
shelter here.

748
00:44:35,009 --> 00:44:36,409
There's no shelter
anywhere.

749
00:44:36,443 --> 00:44:39,179
There is if you know
where to look.

750
00:44:42,616 --> 00:44:44,584
The cold
could kill us both.

751
00:44:44,618 --> 00:44:46,619
- If you light a fire--
- No fire.

752
00:44:46,653 --> 00:44:49,455
- But a fire is--
- No fire.

753
00:44:52,092 --> 00:44:54,260
Have it your way.

754
00:45:01,168 --> 00:45:03,770
We'll stay warmer
if we stay close.

755
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:08,308
Bet you freeze to death
before I do.

756
00:45:10,145 --> 00:45:12,580
Bet your life.

757
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:39,174
Think they're out
looking for you?

758
00:45:40,576 --> 00:45:43,345
- Yes.
- Think they'll find you?

759
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,581
Yes.

760
00:45:48,285 --> 00:45:50,319
You're brave.

761
00:45:51,355 --> 00:45:53,188
Stupid,

762
00:45:53,223 --> 00:45:55,124
but brave.

763
00:45:57,761 --> 00:46:01,030
We start again at first light.
Get some sleep.

764
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:18,847
Stop moving.

765
00:46:18,882 --> 00:46:22,552
I'm just trying
to get comfortable.

766
00:46:22,586 --> 00:46:24,454
Stop it!

767
00:46:36,834 --> 00:46:39,369
- <i>You're still moving.</i>
- Was I?

768
00:46:39,403 --> 00:46:42,005
I didn't notice
that time.

769
00:46:53,082 --> 00:46:54,817
This cannot be true.

770
00:46:54,851 --> 00:46:56,552
Bolton: <i>We've had ravens</i>
<i>from White Harbor,</i>

771
00:46:56,586 --> 00:46:58,788
Barrowton
and the Dreadfort.

772
00:46:58,822 --> 00:47:00,823
I'm afraid it is true.

773
00:47:01,725 --> 00:47:03,626
Why?
Why would Theon--

774
00:47:03,661 --> 00:47:05,896
Because the Greyjoys
are treasonous whores.

775
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:08,599
- <i>My brothers?</i>
- We've heard nothing of them.

776
00:47:08,633 --> 00:47:10,534
( Sighs )

777
00:47:10,569 --> 00:47:12,871
But Rodrik Cassel is dead.

778
00:47:15,274 --> 00:47:17,575
I told you,
never trust a Greyjoy!

779
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:22,714
I must go North at once.

780
00:47:22,748 --> 00:47:24,883
There's still a war
to win, Your Grace.

781
00:47:24,917 --> 00:47:27,385
How can I call myself king
if I can't hold my own castle?

782
00:47:27,419 --> 00:47:28,921
How can I ask men
to follow me if I can't--

783
00:47:28,946 --> 00:47:30,655
You are a king.

784
00:47:30,656 --> 00:47:33,491
And that means you don't have
to do everything yourself.

785
00:47:33,526 --> 00:47:35,327
Let me go
and talk to Theon.

786
00:47:35,361 --> 00:47:38,264
There will be no talk.
He will die for this.

787
00:47:38,298 --> 00:47:41,567
Theon holds the castle
with a skeleton crew.

788
00:47:41,601 --> 00:47:43,936
Let me send word to
my bastard at the Dreadfort.

789
00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:48,174
He can raise a few hundred men and
retake Winterfell before the new moon.

790
00:47:48,208 --> 00:47:51,310
We have the Lannisters
on the run.

791
00:47:51,345 --> 00:47:55,982
If you march all the way back north
now, you'll lose what you gained.

792
00:47:56,016 --> 00:47:59,653
My boy would be honored to
bring you Prince Theon's head.

793
00:47:59,687 --> 00:48:04,291
Tell your son Bran and Rickon's
safety is paramount.

794
00:48:04,325 --> 00:48:07,327
And Theon-- I want him
brought to me alive.

795
00:48:08,863 --> 00:48:11,331
I want to look him
in the eye and ask him why.

796
00:48:11,366 --> 00:48:13,967
And then I'll take
his head myself.

797
00:48:14,002 --> 00:48:17,871
Why on earth would I trust the word
of a lying little savage like you?

798
00:48:17,905 --> 00:48:19,806
I'm no liar.

799
00:48:20,942 --> 00:48:22,876
All wildlings
are liars and savages

800
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:24,745
with no loyalty
to anything or anyone.

801
00:48:24,779 --> 00:48:27,114
I done what I had
to do to stay alive.

802
00:48:27,149 --> 00:48:30,017
I hate the Starks
as well as you do.

803
00:48:30,051 --> 00:48:33,354
Let me serve you,
My Lord.

804
00:48:33,389 --> 00:48:36,191
How? And don't tell me
to put a spear in your hand.

805
00:48:36,225 --> 00:48:38,693
There are other ways
to serve, My Lord.

806
00:48:38,727 --> 00:48:41,262
I'm a prince now,
and you'd do well--

807
00:48:41,297 --> 00:48:44,199
There are other ways
to serve, my prince.

808
00:48:44,234 --> 00:48:46,735
( Chuckles )

809
00:48:48,672 --> 00:48:50,307
Like what?

810
00:48:52,843 --> 00:48:55,646
We know things,
the free people.

811
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,248
You know things?

812
00:48:58,283 --> 00:49:00,184
Like what?

813
00:49:00,218 --> 00:49:02,486
How to eat dirt?
( Laughs )

814
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,522
( Scoffs )
Other things.

815
00:49:06,691 --> 00:49:09,292
Savage things.

816
00:49:11,295 --> 00:49:13,129
Wait outside.

817
00:49:30,045 --> 00:49:32,247
I always wondered
what you had under there.

818
00:49:32,281 --> 00:49:35,283
It comes at a price.

819
00:49:35,317 --> 00:49:37,585
I'm not killing you.
That's your price.

820
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:39,187
I already had that.

821
00:49:40,723 --> 00:49:42,190
What do you want, then,

822
00:49:42,224 --> 00:49:44,826
other than
your miserable life?

823
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:46,962
What all free people want--

824
00:49:46,996 --> 00:49:49,131
my freedom.

825
00:49:54,003 --> 00:49:55,872
Well, you shall
have it, then.

826
00:49:58,141 --> 00:50:00,743
But only if you
serve me well.

827
00:50:06,683 --> 00:50:08,551
- Ow.
- Shh.

828
00:50:08,585 --> 00:50:11,654
- It's not deep.
- I thought they were going to kill me.

829
00:50:11,688 --> 00:50:13,222
They thought so, too.

830
00:50:13,256 --> 00:50:15,892
He hated me,
the man who hit me.

831
00:50:15,926 --> 00:50:18,494
I saw it in his eyes.
Hated me.

832
00:50:18,529 --> 00:50:20,329
He never met me before,

833
00:50:20,364 --> 00:50:23,332
but he wanted
to hurt me.

834
00:50:23,366 --> 00:50:26,402
- Of course he did.
- Why? Why would a stranger--

835
00:50:26,436 --> 00:50:28,704
You are everything
he will never have.

836
00:50:28,738 --> 00:50:30,873
Your horse eats better
than his children.

837
00:50:30,907 --> 00:50:34,243
It doesn't matter now.
He's dead.

838
00:50:34,277 --> 00:50:37,146
I would have given them
bread if I had it.

839
00:50:37,181 --> 00:50:39,782
I hate the King
more than any of them.

840
00:50:39,817 --> 00:50:41,651
Don't say these things.

841
00:50:41,685 --> 00:50:42,952
If the wrong
people hear you--

842
00:50:42,986 --> 00:50:45,288
But you're not
the wrong people.

843
00:50:50,694 --> 00:50:52,862
Don't trust anybody.

844
00:50:52,896 --> 00:50:55,464
Life is safer
that way.

845
00:51:23,862 --> 00:51:27,031
( Murmurs )

846
00:51:36,308 --> 00:51:39,143
And where
are you going?

847
00:51:40,378 --> 00:51:42,947
I have something for you
from Prince Theon.

848
00:51:42,981 --> 00:51:45,816
- What?
- Me.

849
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:51,022
He says I'm to make
the rounds.

850
00:51:57,163 --> 00:51:59,664
And keep you warm.

851
00:52:04,603 --> 00:52:07,205
( Groans )

852
00:52:10,075 --> 00:52:12,743
( Whistles )

853
00:52:21,854 --> 00:52:24,322
( Panting )

854
00:52:26,692 --> 00:52:30,028
The Spice King refuses me
because I'm a bad investment.

855
00:52:30,062 --> 00:52:31,704
The Silk King won't support me

856
00:52:31,729 --> 00:52:33,729
because of his business with
the Lannisters.

857
00:52:33,732 --> 00:52:35,700
Why offend
his best customer?

858
00:52:35,734 --> 00:52:39,103
And the Copper King
offers me a single ship

859
00:52:39,137 --> 00:52:42,506
on the condition that I lie
with him for a night.

860
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:45,508
Does he think I will
whore myself for a boat?

861
00:52:45,543 --> 00:52:49,044
When I came to this city,
I had nothing.

862
00:52:49,079 --> 00:52:51,580
Truly nothing.

863
00:52:51,614 --> 00:52:53,682
I slept by the docks.

864
00:52:53,716 --> 00:52:56,451
And when I could find work
loading the ships, I would eat.

865
00:52:56,486 --> 00:52:59,521
If not,
I dreamed of food.

866
00:52:59,555 --> 00:53:02,557
Today I am the richest
man in Qarth.

867
00:53:02,592 --> 00:53:05,026
Do you think the path
from poverty to wealth

868
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:07,428
is always pure
and honorable?

869
00:53:07,462 --> 00:53:11,098
I have done
many things, Khaleesi,

870
00:53:11,132 --> 00:53:13,634
that a righteous man
would condemn.

871
00:53:13,668 --> 00:53:17,238
And here I am,
