Enjoying
your first hunt?

25
00:03:35,377 --> 00:03:38,578
So far, hunting seems very similar
to riding, My Lord.

26
00:03:38,613 --> 00:03:40,081
With hunting,
there's blood at the end.

27
00:03:40,106 --> 00:03:42,048
They're little boys.

28
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:43,497
I was a little boy
when I was torn away from

29
00:03:43,522 --> 00:03:45,451
my home and brought here.

30
00:03:45,452 --> 00:03:47,052
So I kept my word.

31
00:03:47,087 --> 00:03:49,021
I never ran away.

32
00:03:49,055 --> 00:03:52,158
If I find them soon enough,
I won't hurt them.

33
00:03:53,427 --> 00:03:56,229
Well, I'll hurt them,
but I won't kill them.

34
00:03:56,263 --> 00:03:59,299
Those boys are of far more value
to you alive than dead.

35
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,334
They have no value
to me missing.

36
00:04:01,369 --> 00:04:03,904
Robb will have sent a force
to retake Winterfell by now.

37
00:04:03,938 --> 00:04:07,141
Robb's in the Riverlands.
My sister's in Deepwood Motte.

<i>She'll get here</i>
<i>long before they do.</i>

39
00:04:09,911 --> 00:04:12,561
And Ned Stark always
said 500 men could hold

40
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,181
Winterfell against 10,000.

41
00:04:14,182 --> 00:04:17,117
- <i>( Dogs barking )</i>
- Man: <i>We have a scent!</i>

42
00:04:17,151 --> 00:04:19,752
The hounds have the scent.

43
00:04:19,787 --> 00:04:22,288
Come, Maester,
don't look so grim.

44
00:04:22,322 --> 00:04:25,090
It's all just a game.

45
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,174
Osha: We should have
took more food.

46
00:04:42,209 --> 00:04:44,343
We couldn't risk
going to the kitchens.

47
00:04:44,378 --> 00:04:45,845
Those people
all love you.

48
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:47,280
They would have given
you whatever you needed.

49
00:04:47,314 --> 00:04:49,149
And if Theon found out,
he'd hang them.

50
00:04:49,183 --> 00:04:52,151
- The boy can't survive on walnuts.
- I'm fine.

51
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,455
We've been walking
since before sunrise.

52
00:04:56,489 --> 00:04:58,924
- Even Hodor will tire.
- Hodor.

53
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:01,927
- Even you, sweet giant.
- ( Chuckles ) Hodor.

Wait, I know that farm.

56
00:05:07,767 --> 00:05:10,568
<i>I sent those two</i>
<i>Winterfell orphans there.</i>

57
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,537
Jack and Billy.

58
00:05:12,571 --> 00:05:14,305
They'll give us some food.

59
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,406
We can't risk it.

60
00:05:15,441 --> 00:05:17,108
If Theon tracks us here,
he'll torture them

61
00:05:17,142 --> 00:05:19,110
until he finds out
where we are.

62
00:05:19,145 --> 00:05:21,546
Billy climbs a tree
better than anyone.

63
00:05:21,581 --> 00:05:23,314
You've never seen me
climb a tree, little man.

64
00:05:23,349 --> 00:05:25,850
<i>They'll be after us</i>
<i>with hounds.</i>

65
00:05:25,885 --> 00:05:27,452
<i>We got a good start</i>
<i>on them,</i>

66
00:05:27,486 --> 00:05:29,921
but we can't outrun
hounds forever.

67
00:05:54,981 --> 00:05:58,050
Did you pull a knife
on me in the night?

68
00:06:08,093 --> 00:06:09,760
What's the matter?

69
00:06:09,794 --> 00:06:11,662
Can't be the first time
you pressed your bone

70
00:06:11,696 --> 00:06:13,297
against a woman's ass.

71
00:06:15,433 --> 00:06:17,267
Let's move.

72
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,442
Oh, it is
the first time.

73
00:06:26,377 --> 00:06:28,679
How old are you, boy?

74
00:06:28,713 --> 00:06:31,482
I'm a man
of the Night's Watch.

75
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:36,087
You're a boy who's
never been with a girl.

76
00:06:39,792 --> 00:06:41,493
Don't your stones
start to hurt

77
00:06:41,528 --> 00:06:44,096
if your bone
never gets--

78
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,231
Don't call them that.

79
00:06:46,266 --> 00:06:49,568
What, stones?

80
00:06:49,603 --> 00:06:51,270
Or bone?

81
00:06:51,304 --> 00:06:53,706
Neither.

82
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,041
Both.

83
00:06:57,911 --> 00:06:59,611
Move!

84
00:07:04,684 --> 00:07:06,418
Ygritte: I heard they get
all swollen

85
00:07:06,453 --> 00:07:08,787
and bruised if you
don't use them.

86
00:07:08,822 --> 00:07:10,589
Of course, maybe that's
just what the lads say

87
00:07:10,623 --> 00:07:13,258
when they want me
feeling sorry for them.

88
00:07:13,293 --> 00:07:15,627
As if I'd feel
sorry for them.

89
00:07:16,563 --> 00:07:19,231
Are there
no girl crows?

90
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:23,034
There are no women
of the Night's Watch, no.

91
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:25,136
So the lads just do it
with each other?

92
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,038
No.

93
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:29,573
- Never?
- Never.

94
00:07:29,607 --> 00:07:32,176
We swore an oath.

95
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:34,512
You have sheep
at the Wall?

96
00:07:36,682 --> 00:07:38,716
With your hands, then?

97
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:41,887
No wonder
you're all so miserable.

98
00:07:41,921 --> 00:07:43,389
Would you please shut up?

99
00:07:43,423 --> 00:07:45,558
( Mocking )
Would you please shut up?

100
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,128
You think you're
better than me, crow.

101
00:07:49,162 --> 00:07:51,697
- I'm a free woman--
- You're a free woman?

102
00:07:51,731 --> 00:07:54,000
I might be your prisoner,
but I'm a free woman.

103
00:07:54,034 --> 00:07:55,968
If you're my prisoner,
you're not a free woman.

104
00:07:56,003 --> 00:07:57,603
That's what
"prisoner" means.

105
00:07:57,638 --> 00:07:59,705
And you think you're free?

106
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:02,708
You swore
some stupid oath

107
00:08:02,743 --> 00:08:04,210
and now you can never
touch a girl.

108
00:08:04,244 --> 00:08:06,712
It was my choice
to say the words.

109
00:08:06,746 --> 00:08:08,614
- So you don't like girls?
- Of course I like girls.

110
00:08:08,648 --> 00:08:10,616
But you chose
never to touch them.

111
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:13,353
That's the price you pay if you want
to be a man of the Night's Watch.

112
00:08:13,387 --> 00:08:15,221
So instead of getting
naked with a girl,

113
00:08:15,256 --> 00:08:16,790
you'd prefer
to invade our lands--

114
00:08:16,824 --> 00:08:18,491
Invade your lands?

115
00:08:18,526 --> 00:08:20,460
Wildlings raid
our lands all the time.

116
00:08:20,495 --> 00:08:23,397
Some of them tried to kill my
little brother, a crippled boy!

117
00:08:23,431 --> 00:08:25,400
They're not your lands!

118
00:08:25,434 --> 00:08:27,469
We've been here
the whole time.

119
00:08:27,503 --> 00:08:29,394
You lot came along
and just put up a big wall

120
00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:31,073
and said it was yours.

121
00:08:31,074 --> 00:08:33,709
My father was Ned Stark.

122
00:08:33,744 --> 00:08:35,711
I have the blood
of the First Men.

123
00:08:35,745 --> 00:08:38,981
My ancestors lived here,
same as yours.

124
00:08:41,285 --> 00:08:43,419
So why are you
fighting us?

125
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:01,573
Go on.

126
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:09,148
Now I want you
to tell me what happened.

127
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:12,385
- Guard: <i>Come on, this way.</i>
- <i>( Man screaming )</i>

128
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,021
<i>Come on, speak up.</i>
<i>Speak up.</i>

129
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:21,259
( Sniffs )

130
00:09:21,293 --> 00:09:23,961
Wolfsbane--

131
00:09:23,995 --> 00:09:26,564
a rare substance.

132
00:09:26,598 --> 00:09:29,032
This is no common assassin.

133
00:09:29,067 --> 00:09:31,201
We hanged 20 men
last night.

134
00:09:31,236 --> 00:09:34,037
I don't care
if you hanged 100.

135
00:09:34,071 --> 00:09:35,572
A man tried to kill me.

136
00:09:35,606 --> 00:09:37,641
I want his name
and I want his head.

137
00:09:37,676 --> 00:09:39,143
Mountain: <i>We think it was</i>
<i>an infiltrator</i>

138
00:09:39,177 --> 00:09:42,013
from the Brotherhood
Without Banners.

139
00:09:42,047 --> 00:09:44,816
Pretentious name
for a band of outlaws.

140
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,418
We can't allow rebels
behind our lines

141
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:49,521
to harass us
with impunity.

142
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:51,656
We look like fools
and they look like heroes.

143
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,424
<i>That's how kings fall.</i>

144
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,627
I want them dead,
every one.

145
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:57,428
Killing them
isn't the problem.

146
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:59,398
<i>It's finding them.</i>

147
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,700
Have you gone soft,
Clegane?

148
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:03,835
I always thought you had
a talent for violence.

149
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,472
Burn the villages,
burn the farms.

150
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:09,875
Let them know what it means
to choose the wrong side.

151
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,343
Mmm.

152
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:16,048
Is that mutton?

153
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:17,583
Yes, My Lord.

154
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,185
Don't like mutton.

155
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:22,154
I'll bring
something else.

156
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:24,290
Leave it.

157
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:27,826
- Are you hungry?
- No.

158
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,494
Of course you are.

159
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,062
Eat.

160
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:34,332
I'll eat
in the kitchen later.

161
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:38,536
It's bad manners
to refuse a Lord's offer.

162
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,672
Sit.

163
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,241
Eat.

164
00:10:46,411 --> 00:10:47,778
You're small for your age.

165
00:10:49,247 --> 00:10:51,415
I suppose you've been
underfed your whole life.

166
00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:53,150
I eat a lot.

167
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:56,354
- <i>I just don't grow.</i>
- Hmm.

168
00:10:59,658 --> 00:11:03,562
This will be my last war,

169
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:05,731
win or lose.

170
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,835
Have you ever
lost before?

171
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:11,872
Do you think I'd be in my position
if I had lost a war?

172
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:22,550
But this is the one
I'll be remembered for.

173
00:11:22,584 --> 00:11:25,220
<i>The "War of Five Kings"</i>
<i>they're calling it.</i>

174
00:11:26,789 --> 00:11:29,792
My legacy will be determined
in the coming months.

175
00:11:31,628 --> 00:11:34,230
Do you know
what legacy means?

176
00:11:36,233 --> 00:11:38,801
It's what you pass down
to your children

177
00:11:38,835 --> 00:11:42,204
and your children's
children.

178
00:11:42,239 --> 00:11:45,274
It's what remains of you
when you're gone.

179
00:11:49,013 --> 00:11:52,181
Harren the Black thought this castle
would be his legacy.

180
00:11:53,784 --> 00:11:56,552
The greatest fortress
ever built--

181
00:11:56,587 --> 00:12:00,122
the tallest towers,
the strongest walls.

182
00:12:00,157 --> 00:12:03,693
The Great Hall
had 35 hearths.

183
00:12:03,727 --> 00:12:06,863
35. Can you imagine?

184
00:12:06,897 --> 00:12:08,531
Look at it now--

185
00:12:09,733 --> 00:12:11,534
<i>a blasted ruin.</i>

186
00:12:13,069 --> 00:12:14,637
Do you know
what happened?

187
00:12:14,671 --> 00:12:16,972
Dragons?

188
00:12:17,007 --> 00:12:21,077
Yes, dragons happened.

189
00:12:23,514 --> 00:12:28,017
Harrenhal was built to withstand
an attack from the land.

190
00:12:30,387 --> 00:12:33,288
A million men could have marched
on these walls

191
00:12:33,323 --> 00:12:35,691
and a million men
would have been repelled.

192
00:12:35,725 --> 00:12:41,329
But an attack from the air
with dragon fire-- mm.

193
00:12:41,363 --> 00:12:44,765
Harren and all his sons
roasted alive within these walls.

194
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:49,736
Aegon Targaryen
changed the rules.

195
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:52,738
That's why every child alive
still knows his name

196
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:54,874
300 years after his death.

197
00:12:54,909 --> 00:12:57,277
Aegon and his sisters.

198
00:12:58,412 --> 00:12:59,879
Mm?

199
00:12:59,914 --> 00:13:03,149
It wasn't just Aegon
riding his dragon.

200
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:05,018
It was Rhaenys
and Visenya, too.

201
00:13:05,052 --> 00:13:07,321
Correct.

202
00:13:07,355 --> 00:13:09,590
A student of history,
are you?

203
00:13:09,624 --> 00:13:12,093
Rhaenys rode Meraxes.

204
00:13:12,127 --> 00:13:13,962
Visenya rode Vhagar.

205
00:13:15,698 --> 00:13:18,266
I'm sure I knew that
when I was a boy.

206
00:13:18,301 --> 00:13:22,605
Visenya Targaryen
was a great warrior.

207
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,541
She had a Valyrian steel sword
she called Dark Sister.

208
00:13:25,576 --> 00:13:27,877
Hmm.

209
00:13:27,912 --> 00:13:30,080
She's a heroine
of yours, I take it?

210
00:13:31,348 --> 00:13:32,982
Aren't most girls
more interested

211
00:13:33,017 --> 00:13:34,951
in the pretty maidens
from the songs?

212
00:13:34,985 --> 00:13:37,085
<i>Jonquil with the flowers</i>
<i>in her hair?</i>

213
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,588
- Most girls are idiots.
- <i>Ha!</i>

214
00:13:40,957 --> 00:13:43,457
You remind me
of my daughter.

215
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:46,060
Where did you learn
all this stuff

216
00:13:46,094 --> 00:13:50,097
about Visenya and her
Valyrian Steel sword?

217
00:13:51,266 --> 00:13:53,000
From my father.

218
00:13:55,137 --> 00:13:58,606
He was a well-read
stonemason.

219
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,911
Can't say I've ever met
a literate stonemason.

220
00:14:02,946 --> 00:14:05,715
Have you met many
stonemasons, My Lord?

221
00:14:08,152 --> 00:14:10,120
Careful now, girl.

222
00:14:10,154 --> 00:14:12,356
<i>I enjoy you,</i>
<i>but be careful.</i>

223
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:15,225
Take that back
to the kitchen.

224
00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:17,027
Eat what you want.

225
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:22,098
And, girl.

226
00:14:23,768 --> 00:14:25,869
M'lord.

227
00:14:27,438 --> 00:14:29,939
Lowborn girls
say "M'lord,"

228
00:14:29,974 --> 00:14:32,342
<i>not "My Lord."</i>

229
00:14:32,376 --> 00:14:34,611
If you're going
to pose as a commoner,

230
00:14:34,645 --> 00:14:36,780
you should do it
properly.

231
00:14:38,282 --> 00:14:39,916
My mother served
Lady Dustin

232
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:42,885
for many years,
My Lord.

233
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,389
She taught me how to speak
proper-- properly.

234
00:14:48,225 --> 00:14:49,993
You're too smart
for your own good.

235
00:14:50,027 --> 00:14:53,229
- <i>Has anyone told you that?</i>
- Yes.

236
00:14:54,264 --> 00:14:55,932
Go on.

237
00:15:07,177 --> 00:15:10,579
I beg pardon, Ser.

238
00:15:10,614 --> 00:15:12,915
I should have
come to you after

239
00:15:12,949 --> 00:15:15,251
to thank you
for saving me.

240
00:15:15,285 --> 00:15:17,620
- You were so brave.
- Brave?

241
00:15:17,654 --> 00:15:21,190
A dog doesn't need courage
to chase off rats.

242
00:15:21,224 --> 00:15:23,992
Does it give you joy
to scare people?

243
00:15:24,026 --> 00:15:26,929
No. It gives me joy
to kill people.

244
00:15:26,963 --> 00:15:29,230
Spare me.
You can't tell me

245
00:15:29,265 --> 00:15:32,233
Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell
never killed a man.

246
00:15:32,267 --> 00:15:35,436
It was his duty.
He never liked it.

247
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:37,538
Is that what he told you?

248
00:15:37,572 --> 00:15:40,006
He lied.

249
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,976
Killing is the sweetest
thing there is.

250
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,644
Why are you always
so hateful?

251
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:47,446
You'll be glad
of the hateful things I do

252
00:15:47,481 --> 00:15:50,249
someday when you're queen
and I'm all that stands

253
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,752
between you
and your beloved king.

254
00:16:02,464 --> 00:16:03,998
I've demanded a meeting
of the Thirteen.

255
00:16:04,032 --> 00:16:05,833
One of them did this
or knows who did.

256
00:16:05,868 --> 00:16:07,435
You are one
of the Thirteen.

257
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:09,504
If I wanted your dragons,
I would have taken them.

258
00:16:09,538 --> 00:16:12,807
- They mean nothing to me on their own.
- Nothing?

259
00:16:12,841 --> 00:16:15,443
They're more valuable
than anything in the world.

260
00:16:15,477 --> 00:16:18,212
Shall we look inside my vault and see
what selling your dragons

261
00:16:18,246 --> 00:16:20,214
would buy me
I cannot buy already?

262
00:16:20,248 --> 00:16:22,382
We will get them back.

263
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,250
There is no we,

264
00:16:24,285 --> 00:16:26,786
so why would you help me
get them back?

265
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,587
I took you
under my protection

266
00:16:28,622 --> 00:16:30,689
in front of the rulers
of my city.

267
00:16:30,724 --> 00:16:33,759
A man is what others
say he is and no more.

268
00:16:33,794 --> 00:16:36,396
If they say that
Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a liar,

269
00:16:36,431 --> 00:16:38,866
my word is worth nothing.

270
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,469
I cannot let this thing
happen to you under my roof.

271
00:16:41,503 --> 00:16:43,872
But it did happen
under your roof.

272
00:16:43,906 --> 00:16:47,475
Khaleesi, many times
in my life I have been--

273
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:49,244
I don't care
where you've been.

274
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:16,101
You think we're savages because
we don't live in stone castles.

275
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:20,072
We can't make steel as good
as yours, it's true, but...

276
00:17:20,107 --> 00:17:22,641
We're free.

277
00:17:22,676 --> 00:17:24,468
If someone tried to tell us
we couldn't lie down

278
00:17:24,493 --> 00:17:25,945
as man and woman,

279
00:17:25,946 --> 00:17:28,514
we'd shove a spear
up his ass.

280
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,483
We don't go serving
some shit king

281
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:32,084
who's only king
because his father was.

282
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:35,522
No. No, you serve
Mance Rayder,

283
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:36,956
the King-Beyond-the-Wall.

284
00:17:36,991 --> 00:17:39,893
We chose Mance Rayder
to lead us.

285
00:17:39,928 --> 00:17:42,296
He was a crow,
same as you,

286
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:44,598
but he wanted
to be free.

287
00:17:45,868 --> 00:17:49,104
You could be free, too.

288
00:17:49,138 --> 00:17:50,738
You don't need to live
your whole life

289
00:17:50,773 --> 00:17:52,973
taking commands
from old men.

290
00:17:53,007 --> 00:17:55,976
Wake up when you want
to wake up.

291
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:58,912
I could show you the streams
to fish, the woods to hunt.

292
00:17:58,946 --> 00:18:03,148
<i>Build yourself a cabin and find</i>
<i>a woman to lie with in the night.</i>

293
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:06,751
You're a pretty lad.

294
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:10,154
The girls would claw each other's
eyes out to get naked with you.

295
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:15,293
Walk.

296
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:18,596
I could teach you
how to do it.

297
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:20,832
I know how to do it.

298
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:26,672
You know nothing,
Jon Snow.

299
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:50,162
( Chatter )

300
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:57,135
And what did she say?

301
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,804
She admired your spirit,
Your Grace.

302
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:01,839
And what then?

303
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:06,011
She, uh...

304
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:08,013
If every man
were held accountable

305
00:19:08,048 --> 00:19:10,015
for the actions
of every distant relative,

306
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:13,218
Ser Alton, we'd all hang.

307
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:19,591
She tore the paper
in half, Your Grace.

308
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,126
You've acted with honor.

309
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,228
I thank you for it.

310
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:26,298
Lord Karstark, see that
Ser Alton's pen is clean.

311
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:27,799
And give him a hot supper.

312
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:30,303
Ser Alton's pen
is occupied, Your Grace.

313
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:32,872
The prisoners
from the Yellow Fork.

314
00:19:32,907 --> 00:19:34,941
Too many prisoners.

315
00:19:34,976 --> 00:19:37,711
Is there room
for Ser Alton?

316
00:19:37,746 --> 00:19:40,948
Does he need
to lie down?

317
00:19:43,118 --> 00:19:45,220
Have the men
build him a new pen.

318
00:19:45,254 --> 00:19:47,889
<i>Put him in with</i>
<i>the Kingslayer for now.</i>

319
00:19:47,924 --> 00:19:50,092
Have your boy
watch over them.

320
00:19:50,126 --> 00:19:52,761
Torrhen.

321
00:19:52,795 --> 00:19:54,429
That will be all.

322
00:20:01,103 --> 00:20:02,636
Your Grace.

323
00:20:02,671 --> 00:20:04,905
<i>A minute of your time?</i>

324
00:20:19,121 --> 00:20:21,356
I've been treating
your wounded men.

325
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:24,002
And my enemies
as some of my bannermen

326
00:20:24,027 --> 00:20:25,694
are fond of mentioning.

327
00:20:25,695 --> 00:20:27,329
They're not my enemies.

328
00:20:27,363 --> 00:20:29,465
That's what I tell
my bannermen.

329
00:20:29,499 --> 00:20:32,201
I've already run through the
supplies I brought with me.

330
00:20:32,235 --> 00:20:33,635
Some are easily replaced--

331
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:36,638
egg yolks, turpentine,
oil of roses.

332
00:20:36,672 --> 00:20:39,074
But some are not.

333
00:20:39,108 --> 00:20:42,176
I need silk
for stitching.

334
00:20:43,645 --> 00:20:46,447
I need fennel root
for those with fever, willow bark.

335
00:20:46,481 --> 00:20:48,682
Mostly I need
milk of the poppy.

336
00:20:48,717 --> 00:20:51,885
You saw what it was like
to amputate a foot without any.

337
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,932
I assume there will be
more loss of limb before

338
00:20:53,957 --> 00:20:55,522
this war is over.

339
00:20:55,523 --> 00:20:59,560
- If you need help finding these--
- I know where to find them.

340
00:21:00,696 --> 00:21:03,398
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
interrupt you.

341
00:21:03,432 --> 00:21:06,735
Continue, My Lady.

342
00:21:09,907 --> 00:21:11,802
You're riding to the Crag
to negotiate a surrender?

343
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:13,717
Yes.

344
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:17,280
The Crag will have a Maester
and he will have what I need.

345
00:21:17,347 --> 00:21:19,481
I expect he will.

346
00:21:19,516 --> 00:21:21,450
If I could write a list--

347
00:21:21,484 --> 00:21:23,885
come with me
to the Crag.

348
00:21:25,387 --> 00:21:27,021
I don't think
that will be--

349
00:21:27,056 --> 00:21:29,357
Let the Maester
show you his stores.

350
00:21:29,391 --> 00:21:33,527
I want the wounded men
to be treated well--

351
00:21:33,562 --> 00:21:35,463
all the wounded men.

352
00:21:38,601 --> 00:21:41,069
<i>( Dog barking )</i>

353
00:21:43,005 --> 00:21:45,540
Woman:
<i>Children, come inside, quick.</i>

354
00:21:45,575 --> 00:21:47,743
Hurry up!

355
00:21:47,777 --> 00:21:50,946
- <i>( Dog barking )</i>
- Man: <i>Can't find anything, Ser.</i>

356
00:21:50,981 --> 00:21:53,816
- They've lost the scent.
- Try again.

357
00:21:53,851 --> 00:21:55,418
We've circled
this farmhouse twice.

358
00:21:55,452 --> 00:21:57,053
There's no sign of them.

359
00:21:57,087 --> 00:22:00,957
We could start the search fresh
in the morning, My Lord.

360
00:22:00,991 --> 00:22:02,893
I'm looking at spending
the rest of life

361
00:22:02,927 --> 00:22:05,863
being treated like a fool and
a eunuch by my own people.

362
00:22:05,897 --> 00:22:07,898
Ask yourself, "Is there anything
I wouldn't do

363
00:22:07,932 --> 00:22:09,500
to stop that
from happening?"

364
00:22:09,534 --> 00:22:11,702
The hounds will find
the scent again.

365
00:22:11,736 --> 00:22:14,004
I'll beat them
until they do.

366
00:22:14,038 --> 00:22:15,405
I'll whip every man here

367
00:22:15,439 --> 00:22:17,907
<i>until I have</i>
<i>both those boys in hand.</i>

368
00:22:17,941 --> 00:22:20,909
And once I've got them,
the pampered little shits...

369
00:22:22,512 --> 00:22:24,779
It's better to be
cruel than weak.

370
00:22:24,813 --> 00:22:27,047
Prince Theon.

371
00:22:27,082 --> 00:22:29,216
- Where are they?
- Who, m'lord?

372
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,450
The Stark boys.
Where are they?

373
00:22:30,485 --> 00:22:32,719
I don't know.
I seen no one.

374
00:22:32,754 --> 00:22:34,655
Oh!

375
00:22:34,689 --> 00:22:36,123
Think harder.

376
00:22:36,158 --> 00:22:40,328
I swear, m'lord,
I don't know.

377
00:22:40,363 --> 00:22:43,265
My Lord, over here.

378
00:22:45,969 --> 00:22:48,738
I think I've found
what we're looking for.

379
00:22:58,548 --> 00:23:00,783
Send the old man home.

380
00:23:06,021 --> 00:23:07,655
Go back to Winterfell.

381
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,524
Take him back.

382
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,262
Theon, don't do this.

383
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,301
<i>( Birds chirping )</i>

384
00:23:32,715 --> 00:23:34,482
You came back.

385
00:23:34,516 --> 00:23:36,617
As soon as I heard.

386
00:23:36,652 --> 00:23:39,220
Do you know anything?

387
00:23:39,254 --> 00:23:42,290
- Irri is dead.
- <i>I know.</i>

388
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:45,527
- She was a good--
- she's dead.

389
00:23:45,561 --> 00:23:47,329
She died alone.

390
00:23:47,363 --> 00:23:49,831
She died for me
and I couldn't protect her.

391
00:23:51,033 --> 00:23:52,601
Doreah?

392
00:23:52,635 --> 00:23:54,670
We can't find her.

393
00:23:55,972 --> 00:23:58,807
She must be dead, too.

394
00:23:58,842 --> 00:24:00,976
I led my people
out of the Red Waste

395
00:24:01,011 --> 00:24:02,578
and into
the slaughterhouse.

396
00:24:02,612 --> 00:24:04,681
I should have been here.

397
00:24:05,716 --> 00:24:08,051
You went to find me
a ship.

398
00:24:08,085 --> 00:24:10,253
My place is by your side.

399
00:24:10,288 --> 00:24:12,655
I shouldn't have left you
alone with these people.

400
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:14,323
These people?

401
00:24:14,358 --> 00:24:16,825
They are not
to be trusted.

402
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:19,494
And who is to be trusted?

403
00:24:19,528 --> 00:24:21,095
Who are my people?

404
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:23,331
The Targaryens?

405
00:24:23,365 --> 00:24:25,233
I only knew one--
my brother,

406
00:24:25,267 --> 00:24:27,468
and he would have let
1,000 men rape me

407
00:24:27,502 --> 00:24:29,570
if it had got him
the crown.

408
00:24:29,604 --> 00:24:31,205
The Dothraki?

409
00:24:31,239 --> 00:24:33,428
Most of them turned on me
the day that Khal Drogo

410
00:24:33,453 --> 00:24:34,909
fell from his horse.

411
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,677
Your people
are in Westeros.

412
00:24:36,712 --> 00:24:39,413
The people in Westeros
don't know I'm alive.

413
00:24:39,447 --> 00:24:41,482
- They will soon enough.
- And then what?

414
00:24:41,517 --> 00:24:43,718
They'll pray for my return?

415
00:24:43,753 --> 00:24:46,221
They'll wave dragon banners
and shout my name?

416
00:24:46,256 --> 00:24:49,392
That's what my brother believed
and he was a fool.

417
00:24:49,426 --> 00:24:51,861
You are not your brother.

418
00:24:51,895 --> 00:24:54,463
Trust me, Khaleesi.

419
00:24:54,498 --> 00:24:56,632
There it is--

420
00:24:56,667 --> 00:24:58,901
"trust me."

421
00:24:58,935 --> 00:25:01,537
And it's you I should trust,
Ser Jorah?

422
00:25:01,571 --> 00:25:03,505
Only you?

423
00:25:06,242 --> 00:25:09,644
I don't need trust
any longer.

424
00:25:09,678 --> 00:25:12,513
I don't want it and I don't have
room for it.

425
00:25:12,547 --> 00:25:14,682
You are too young
to be so--

426
00:25:14,716 --> 00:25:16,918
And you are too familiar.

427
00:25:21,357 --> 00:25:23,825
Forgive me, Khaleesi.

428
00:25:25,428 --> 00:25:28,531
No one can survive
in this world without help.

429
00:25:28,565 --> 00:25:29,999
No one.

430
00:25:30,034 --> 00:25:32,636
Let me help you, please.

431
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:35,438
Tell me how.

432
00:25:36,874 --> 00:25:38,741
Find my dragons.

433
00:25:46,517 --> 00:25:49,319
Ygritte: How long till we get
back to your crows?

434
00:25:50,721 --> 00:25:52,455
We're close.

435
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:55,993
What, a day?
A half-day?

436
00:25:59,931 --> 00:26:02,599
You don't know, do you?

437
00:26:02,634 --> 00:26:05,536
- Do you even know where they are?
- We're close.

438
00:26:07,306 --> 00:26:09,540
What do you think they'll say
when they hear about you and me?

439
00:26:09,575 --> 00:26:11,643
Nothing happened
between you and me.

440
00:26:11,677 --> 00:26:15,047
"I swear it,
old master king crow, Ser,

441
00:26:15,081 --> 00:26:17,816
we were only close
together for warmth.

442
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,452
And then I felt it,

443
00:26:19,486 --> 00:26:22,188
right up against
me backside like a club.

444
00:26:22,222 --> 00:26:24,690
I can show you the bruise
on me tailbone.

445
00:26:24,725 --> 00:26:28,160
And before I knew
what was where, his-- his--

446
00:26:28,195 --> 00:26:31,130
well, it was all out in the open,
all angry as you like.

447
00:26:31,198 --> 00:26:35,201
And I didn't want to want it,
but, oh, I did!

448
00:26:35,235 --> 00:26:38,203
And he spread me legs
and-- ruined.

449
00:26:38,237 --> 00:26:39,905
The shame of it.

450
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:42,074
Now I can never marry
a perfumed lord.

451
00:26:42,109 --> 00:26:43,804
What will me poor
savage father say?"

452
00:26:43,829 --> 00:26:45,778
Turn back around.

453
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:47,914
"And I thought that we were done,
but he said,

454
00:26:47,948 --> 00:26:50,684
( deep voice )
'Turn back around.'"

455
00:26:50,718 --> 00:26:53,386
( normal voice )
I'll tell you what, Jon Snow,

456
00:26:53,421 --> 00:26:55,522
since it's going to be
your word against mine,

457
00:26:55,556 --> 00:26:59,425
and since you can't talk
about it without blushing,

458
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:02,529
we may as well just.

459
00:27:03,464 --> 00:27:05,598
What, right here
in the muck?

460
00:27:05,633 --> 00:27:07,834
I'll keep you
warm enough.

461
00:27:09,804 --> 00:27:11,905
Are you that afraid
of it?

462
00:27:11,939 --> 00:27:13,440
That's enough.

463
00:27:13,474 --> 00:27:15,909
Oh, it's nice

464
00:27:15,943 --> 00:27:18,978
and wet and warm.

465
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:20,814
Enough

466
00:27:21,949 --> 00:27:23,717
it don't have teeth.

467
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:33,026
All right!

468
00:27:33,894 --> 00:27:35,528
All right.

469
00:27:36,964 --> 00:27:38,597
Gods, you're dull.

470
00:27:40,167 --> 00:27:42,735
( Grunting )

471
00:27:48,774 --> 00:27:50,575
<i>( Sword rings )</i>

00:28:01,687 --> 00:28:03,621
<i>( Ygritte whistles )</i>

473
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:17,270
Should have took me
while you had the chance.

474

<i>( Sansa crying )</i>

475
00:28:27,683 --> 00:28:29,885

<i>No, no!</i>

- ( Laughs )

477
00:28:39,095 --> 00:28:41,162
( Screams )

478
00:28:49,136 --> 00:28:52,438
No. Oh, no.

479
00:29:02,316 --> 00:29:05,152
( Whimpering )

480
00:29:08,223 --> 00:29:10,591
It's all right.
Give me that.

481
00:29:10,626 --> 00:29:14,862
If the queen sees I can have
Joffrey's children now...

482
00:29:14,897 --> 00:29:16,631
Help me flip it over.

483
00:29:33,347 --> 00:29:36,182
- Where are you going?
- To tell her Grace.

484
00:29:38,085 --> 00:29:40,186
You'll say nothing
to anyone.

485
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,321
Do you understand?

486
00:30:02,477 --> 00:30:05,812
Your mother might have
prepared you.

487
00:30:05,847 --> 00:30:08,215
You flowered, my dear.
No more.

488
00:30:08,249 --> 00:30:11,418
My mother told me, but I
thought it would be different.

489
00:30:11,453 --> 00:30:12,953
In what way?

490
00:30:12,988 --> 00:30:16,157
I thought
it would be less--

491
00:30:16,192 --> 00:30:19,294
less messy.

492
00:30:19,328 --> 00:30:22,097
Wait until you bear
the child.

493
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,234
You're a woman now.

494
00:30:25,268 --> 00:30:28,337
Do you have any idea
what that means?

495
00:30:28,372 --> 00:30:30,873
I'm fit to bear children
for the king?

496
00:30:30,908 --> 00:30:33,343
A prospect that
once delighted you--

497
00:30:33,377 --> 00:30:35,812
bringing little princes
and princesses into the world,

498
00:30:35,846 --> 00:30:39,548
the greatest honor
for a queen.

499
00:30:43,953 --> 00:30:46,921
Joffrey has always
been difficult.

500
00:30:46,955 --> 00:30:49,056
Even his birth,
I labored a day and a half

501
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:51,158
to bring him
into this world.

502
00:30:51,192 --> 00:30:53,627
You cannot imagine
the pain.

503
00:30:53,662 --> 00:30:55,563
I screamed so loudly,
I was sure

504
00:30:55,597 --> 00:30:57,065
Robert would hear me
in the Kingswood.

505
00:30:57,099 --> 00:31:00,134
His Grace was not
with you?

506
00:31:00,168 --> 00:31:01,669
Robert was hunting.

507
00:31:01,704 --> 00:31:03,572
That was his custom.

508
00:31:06,209 --> 00:31:08,911
Whenever my time was near,

509
00:31:08,946 --> 00:31:11,548
my royal husband
would flee to the trees

510
00:31:11,582 --> 00:31:16,419
with his huntsmen
and his hounds.

511
00:31:16,453 --> 00:31:17,987
And when he returned,
he would present me

512
00:31:18,021 --> 00:31:21,223
with some pelts
or a stag's head,

513
00:31:21,257 --> 00:31:23,124
and I would present him
with a baby.

514
00:31:24,893 --> 00:31:27,562
Not that I wanted
him there, mind you.

515
00:31:27,596 --> 00:31:30,631
I had Grand Maester Pycelle,
an army of midwives,

516
00:31:30,665 --> 00:31:32,633
and I had my brother.

517
00:31:32,667 --> 00:31:36,004
When they told Jaime he wasn't
allowed in the birthing room,

518
00:31:36,038 --> 00:31:39,374
he smiled and asked
which one of them

519
00:31:39,409 --> 00:31:41,542
proposed to keep him out.

520
00:31:44,647 --> 00:31:47,216
Joffrey will show you
no such devotion.

521
00:31:49,586 --> 00:31:52,155
You may never
love the king,

522
00:31:52,189 --> 00:31:54,056
but you will love
his children.

523
00:31:54,091 --> 00:31:57,460
I love his Grace
with all my heart.

524
00:31:57,494 --> 00:32:00,362
That's so very
touching to hear.

525
00:32:04,867 --> 00:32:07,135
Permit me to share
some womanly wisdom with you

526
00:32:07,169 --> 00:32:10,171
on this very special day.

527
00:32:10,205 --> 00:32:14,007
The more people you love,
the weaker you are.

528
00:32:14,041 --> 00:32:17,611
You'll do things for them that
you know you shouldn't do.

529
00:32:17,645 --> 00:32:21,348
You'll act the fool to make them
happy, to keep them safe.

530
00:32:23,718 --> 00:32:26,586
Love no one
but your children.

531
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:30,189
On that front,
a mother has no choice.

532
00:32:30,223 --> 00:32:34,861
But... shouldn't
I love Joffrey, Your Grace?

533
00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:40,033
You can try,

534
00:32:40,068 --> 00:32:42,036
little dove.

535
00:32:47,809 --> 00:32:49,944
<i>( Chatter )</i>

536
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,555
Who did you say
your mother was again?

537
00:33:00,589 --> 00:33:02,356
Cinda Lannister.

538
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:04,158
Is she the fat one?

539
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,927
Well, perhaps she's gotten
a little larger than she--

540
00:33:06,961 --> 00:33:10,730
No, no. There's only one
fat Lannister.

541
00:33:10,765 --> 00:33:13,634
If she was your mother,
you'd know it.

542
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:18,439
I-- I squired
for you once, you know?

543
00:33:19,608 --> 00:33:21,075
When?

544
00:33:21,109 --> 00:33:24,512
The tournament the day
of Willem Frey's wedding.

545
00:33:24,547 --> 00:33:27,583
I went to
Willem Frey's wedding?

546
00:33:27,617 --> 00:33:29,418
<i>You did.</i>

547
00:33:29,452 --> 00:33:31,887
Your squire had gotten
so drunk the night before that he--

548
00:33:31,922 --> 00:33:34,056
He threw up on his horse

549
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:35,624
on the way
to the tourney grounds.

550
00:33:35,658 --> 00:33:38,193
- What was his name?
- Bryan.

551
00:33:38,227 --> 00:33:41,395
( Laughs )
Poor lad.

552
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:44,432
That was my brother's doing,
I seem to recall.

553
00:33:46,634 --> 00:33:48,802
I remember you.

554
00:33:48,836 --> 00:33:51,704
You had never squired
for anyone before.

555
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:53,673
That's right.
I ran up and volunteered.

556
00:33:53,707 --> 00:33:57,076
"Let me, My Lord.
Let me."

557
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:59,545
My father was furious,

558
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,314
afraid I'd embarrass
our family

559
00:34:01,348 --> 00:34:03,782
in front of <i>the</i> family.

560
00:34:05,885 --> 00:34:07,352
You didn't, though.

561
00:34:07,387 --> 00:34:09,854
- You really remember?
- Mm.

562
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:12,390
You knew when you were needed
and when to go away.

563
00:34:12,424 --> 00:34:13,958
It's a rare talent.

564
00:34:13,992 --> 00:34:17,761
Most of my squires,
they mean well,

565
00:34:17,796 --> 00:34:21,232
but young men with big jobs,
they tend to overdo them.

566
00:34:21,266 --> 00:34:23,133
Well, when I think
back to that day--

567
00:34:23,168 --> 00:34:24,935
( hisses )

568
00:34:33,043 --> 00:34:34,944
You were saying?

569
00:34:34,978 --> 00:34:37,381
I--

570
00:34:37,415 --> 00:34:40,317
never mind.
It's embarrassing.

571
00:34:40,352 --> 00:34:43,054
More embarrassing
than being chained to a post

572
00:34:43,088 --> 00:34:44,856
covered in your own shit?

573
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:48,861
I remember everything
about that day--

574
00:34:48,895 --> 00:34:51,230
your helmet, your horse,

575
00:34:51,265 --> 00:34:53,966
the rake line in the dirt
along the list,

576
00:34:54,001 --> 00:34:55,468
where the sun was
in the sky

577
00:34:55,502 --> 00:34:57,703
when you knocked
Balon Swann from his horse,

578
00:34:57,738 --> 00:35:00,940
and the dent in your shield
when you handed it back to me.

579
00:35:03,009 --> 00:35:05,911
I'll remember it all
until I die.

580
00:35:07,547 --> 00:35:09,448
That was the best day
of my life.

581
00:35:12,351 --> 00:35:16,388
And I remember being on the field
after it was over.

582
00:35:16,422 --> 00:35:17,890
All the competitors
were done.

583
00:35:17,924 --> 00:35:19,926
I was the last one
out there.

584
00:35:22,029 --> 00:35:24,697
And I couldn't leave.

585
00:35:24,732 --> 00:35:27,000
<i>I couldn't bring myself</i>
<i>to go and sit with my family</i>

586
00:35:27,034 --> 00:35:29,202
at a table so far
on the edge of the feast

587
00:35:29,236 --> 00:35:31,571
you could barely
even see the bride.

588
00:35:31,606 --> 00:35:34,039
And I couldn't bear to tell them
what it had been like squiring for you

589
00:35:35,009 --> 00:35:36,556
when I knew that they could
never have the faintest idea

590
00:35:36,581 --> 00:35:37,872
what I was talking about.

591
00:35:39,847 --> 00:35:41,848
I understand completely.

592
00:35:41,883 --> 00:35:44,918
How could you?

593
00:35:44,953 --> 00:35:47,855
S-sorry, I-- I didn't
mean to doubt you.

594
00:35:47,889 --> 00:35:51,391
- It's just that I--
- I was 16 once.

595
00:35:51,426 --> 00:35:54,895
I also had to replace someone's
squire on short notice.

596
00:35:54,929 --> 00:35:56,597
Which knight was it?

597
00:35:56,631 --> 00:35:59,399
Barristan Selmy.

598
00:36:00,868 --> 00:36:02,669
The fight against
the Kingswood outlaws.

599
00:36:02,703 --> 00:36:05,372
Before your time.

600
00:36:05,406 --> 00:36:06,907
What was he like?

601
00:36:06,941 --> 00:36:09,676
( Sighs )

602
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:13,147
He was

603
00:36:13,181 --> 00:36:16,016
a painter,

604
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:19,353
a painter
who only used red.

605
00:36:21,823 --> 00:36:25,927
I couldn't imagine being
able to fight like that,

606
00:36:25,961 --> 00:36:28,163
not back then.

607
00:36:28,197 --> 00:36:30,553
And to help him do that,
to be a part of something

608
00:36:30,578 --> 00:36:32,578
that perfect...

609
00:36:34,804 --> 00:36:37,373
I don't need to explain
how that felt, not to you.

610
00:36:38,375 --> 00:36:40,076
It's hard to put
into words.

611
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:43,246
It's like stepping
into a dream

612
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,449
you've been dreaming
for as long as you can remember

613
00:36:46,484 --> 00:36:48,318
and finding out
that the dream

614
00:36:48,352 --> 00:36:51,388
is more real
than your life.

615
00:36:53,825 --> 00:36:56,928
Leaving
that battlefield was

616
00:36:56,962 --> 00:36:59,063
like being dragged off
to prison.

617
00:36:59,098 --> 00:37:02,467
- Did you squire for him again?
- No.

618
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:06,238
I didn't have your gift.

619
00:37:06,273 --> 00:37:09,609
He couldn't take a step
without stepping on me.

620
00:37:09,643 --> 00:37:12,945
I was awful,
a complete liability...

621
00:37:12,979 --> 00:37:16,582
until one of the outlaws

622
00:37:16,616 --> 00:37:20,185
decided to take on
a 16-year-old squire.

623
00:37:25,858 --> 00:37:28,425
It's a good thing
I am who I am.

624
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:32,129
( Chuckles ) I'd have been useless
at anything else.

625
00:37:36,702 --> 00:37:39,770
I'm not well-suited
for imprisonment.

626
00:37:39,805 --> 00:37:41,506
Shocking, I know.

627
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,241
Some men are.

628
00:37:43,275 --> 00:37:46,778
Ned Stark--
I imagine he made

629
00:37:46,813 --> 00:37:50,249
an excellent prisoner
right up until the end.

630
00:37:50,284 --> 00:37:53,752
But me, though--
my life has left me

631
00:37:53,787 --> 00:37:56,822
uniquely unfit
for constraint.

632
00:37:58,524 --> 00:37:59,991
Have you thought about...?

633
00:38:00,025 --> 00:38:01,626
Of course.

634
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:04,529
- Every day.
- And?

635
00:38:06,264 --> 00:38:10,701
Good prisoners breed
good jailers, apparently.

636
00:38:10,735 --> 00:38:12,870
The Starks
are very careful.

637
00:38:14,072 --> 00:38:18,209
But there is a way,
I think.

638
00:38:18,244 --> 00:38:20,879
It wasn't possible
until now.

639
00:38:20,913 --> 00:38:24,116
What is it?

640
00:38:28,255 --> 00:38:31,224
- It's actually quite simple.
- Well, let me help you.

641
00:38:31,259 --> 00:38:34,060
You'll only have
to do one thing.

642
00:38:34,095 --> 00:38:35,962
Tell me.

643
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,667
You'll have to die.

644
00:38:51,978 --> 00:38:54,079
<i>( Crunching )</i>

645
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:13,800
( Choking )

646
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:19,938
( Bone breaks )

647
00:39:25,478 --> 00:39:28,347
<i>( Bird screeching )</i>

648
00:39:33,853 --> 00:39:36,488
Jorah the Andal.

649
00:39:36,522 --> 00:39:39,624
This man must sail
past old Valyria.

650
00:39:39,658 --> 00:39:43,962
All who travel too close to
the Doom must have protection.

651
00:39:43,996 --> 00:39:45,897
I didn't come here
for lessons.

652
00:39:45,932 --> 00:39:48,200
No, you came
for the dragons.

653
00:39:48,234 --> 00:39:50,302
You have them?

654
00:39:51,504 --> 00:39:53,472
Where are they?

655
00:39:53,506 --> 00:39:55,507
Draw your sword.

656
00:39:55,541 --> 00:39:59,210
See what your steel
is worth.

657
00:40:01,848 --> 00:40:05,817
You want to please
the Mother of Dragons.

658
00:40:10,623 --> 00:40:13,224
You love her.

659
00:40:16,162 --> 00:40:18,329
Where are the dragons?

660
00:40:19,698 --> 00:40:22,233
Will you betray her again,
Jorah the Andal?

661
00:40:26,805 --> 00:40:29,640
Will you betray her again?

662
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:33,511
Never.

663
00:40:39,283 --> 00:40:41,517
<i>The thief you seek</i>

664
00:40:41,552 --> 00:40:44,519
is with her now.

665
00:40:48,958 --> 00:40:51,292
Spice King: <i>I did not leave</i>
<i>the comfort of my home</i>

666
00:40:51,326 --> 00:40:53,093
to come to yours
and be called a thief.

667
00:40:53,128 --> 00:40:55,062
No one is calling you
a thief.

668
00:40:55,096 --> 00:40:56,797
Who is she to accuse us?

669
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,833
Please,
they're my children.

670
00:40:58,867 --> 00:41:01,135
- I'm begging you.
- Begging us?

671
00:41:01,169 --> 00:41:03,604
It wasn't very long ago
you were threatening us.

672
00:41:03,638 --> 00:41:06,340
Without me,
the dragons will die.

673
00:41:06,375 --> 00:41:08,442
It will be
for the best.

674
00:41:08,477 --> 00:41:10,745
<i>Your dragons</i>
<i>will bring the world</i>

675
00:41:10,779 --> 00:41:13,548
nothing but death
and misery, my dear.

676
00:41:13,582 --> 00:41:15,984
If I knew where they were,
I would not tell you.

677
00:41:16,018 --> 00:41:17,953
Pyat Pree:
<i>You are cruel, my friend.</i>

678
00:41:17,987 --> 00:41:20,956
The mother of dragons
is in the right.

679
00:41:20,991 --> 00:41:24,127
<i>She must be reunited</i>
<i>with her babies.</i>

680
00:41:24,161 --> 00:41:28,031
- I will help you, Khaleesi.
- How?

681
00:41:28,065 --> 00:41:31,735
I will take you
to the House of the Undying

682
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:33,737
where I have put them.

683
00:41:34,772 --> 00:41:36,907
You have my dragons?

684
00:41:36,941 --> 00:41:39,210
When I learned you were
coming to our city,

685
00:41:39,244 --> 00:41:41,946
I made an arrangement
with the King of Qarth.

686
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,981
( Laughter )

687
00:41:44,015 --> 00:41:45,382
He procured them for me.

688
00:41:45,417 --> 00:41:48,386
- But there is no King of Qarth.
- Xaro: There is now.

689
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,621
That was the other half
of the arrangement.

690
00:41:52,858 --> 00:41:55,927
<i>You would keep your gates</i>
<i>and your minds closed</i>

691
00:41:55,961 --> 00:41:59,098
to everything
outside your walls,

692
00:41:59,132 --> 00:42:02,234
but Qarth cannot remain
the greatest city that ever was

693
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:03,903
if it refuses to change.

694
00:42:03,937 --> 00:42:06,573
I will open Qarth
to the world

695
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:10,878
as I have forced it
to open itself to me.

696
00:42:10,912 --> 00:42:13,847
Your ambition
is an inspiration.

697
00:42:13,882 --> 00:42:16,917
But like all upstarts,
you overreach.

698
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:19,686
Three dragons
the size of cats

699
00:42:19,721 --> 00:42:22,022
and an alliance
with a charlatan

700
00:42:22,056 --> 00:42:24,558
do not make you a king.

701
00:42:24,592 --> 00:42:26,793
An upstart
and a charlatan?

702
00:42:26,828 --> 00:42:29,863
<i>Empires have been</i>
<i>built by less.</i>

703
00:42:29,897 --> 00:42:33,333
Those on the margins
often come to control the center,

704
00:42:33,367 --> 00:42:35,701
and those in the center
make room for them,

705
00:42:35,736 --> 00:42:37,436
<i>willingly or otherwise.</i>

706
00:42:41,774 --> 00:42:45,143
The Mother of Dragons
will be with her babies.

707
00:42:46,712 --> 00:42:48,246
She will give them
her love

708
00:42:48,281 --> 00:42:51,049
and they will thrive
by her side...

709
00:42:53,585 --> 00:42:55,286
forever.

710
00:43:15,142 --> 00:43:17,644
A mother should be
with her children.

711
00:43:20,782 --> 00:43:23,451
Where will you run to,
Daenerys Stormborn?

712
00:43:23,485 --> 00:43:26,788
Your dragons wait for you
in the House of the Undying.

713
00:43:26,822 --> 00:43:29,125
Come see them.

714
00:43:38,002 --> 00:43:40,270
- Lady Stark!
- No farther.

715
00:43:40,304 --> 00:43:42,038
Keep your hands
off me, woman.

716
00:43:42,072 --> 00:43:45,742
Don't enter without
an invitation, <i>man.</i>

717
00:43:47,111 --> 00:43:49,212
Forgive me.
Lady Stark.

718
00:43:49,246 --> 00:43:51,915
- Catelyn: <i>What is it?</i>
- They caught the Kingslayer.

719
00:43:55,052 --> 00:43:57,787
( Men shouting )

720
00:43:57,789 --> 00:44:00,523
- Kill the fucking Kingslayer!
- Hang him!

721
00:44:00,591 --> 00:44:04,160
( Men shouting )

722
00:44:04,195 --> 00:44:06,029
You'll die today.

723
00:44:06,063 --> 00:44:08,531
Justice for
the Karstark.

724
00:44:21,679 --> 00:44:23,314
Gut him!

725
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:38,229
Get back!
I want his head!

726
00:44:39,498 --> 00:44:41,899
Any man who stands
between a father

727
00:44:41,933 --> 00:44:44,435
and his vengeance
asks for death.

728
00:44:44,469 --> 00:44:46,704
Lord Karstark,

729
00:44:46,738 --> 00:44:49,640
this man
is our prisoner.

730
00:44:49,674 --> 00:44:51,575
This monster
killed my son.

731
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:53,645
And crippled mine.

732
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:55,446
He will answer
for his crimes,

733
00:44:55,481 --> 00:44:57,514
<i>I promise you,</i>
<i>but not here.</i>

734
00:44:57,549 --> 00:44:59,851
I will have his head.
And if you try and stop me--

735
00:44:59,885 --> 00:45:02,286
You will strike me down?

736
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,622
Have you forgotten me, Ser?

737
00:45:04,656 --> 00:45:06,724
<i>I am the widow of your</i>
<i>liege Lord Eddark Stark.</i>

738
00:45:06,758 --> 00:45:08,259
I am the mother
of your king!

739
00:45:08,293 --> 00:45:11,128
- And where is our king now?
- You know very well.

740
00:45:11,163 --> 00:45:13,298
He has gone to the Crag
to accept the surrender.

741
00:45:13,332 --> 00:45:17,068
Aye, gone to the Crag,
but not to negotiate.

742
00:45:17,102 --> 00:45:19,003
He brought that
foreign bitch with him.

743
00:45:19,038 --> 00:45:19,845
How dare you?

744
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:21,991
Threatening My Lady
is an act of treason.

745
00:45:22,075 --> 00:45:23,275
Treason?

746
00:45:23,309 --> 00:45:25,077
How can it be treason
to kill Lannisters?

747
00:45:25,111 --> 00:45:27,179
I understand
your grief, My Lord--

748
00:45:27,214 --> 00:45:29,648
better than most
I understand it--

749
00:45:29,682 --> 00:45:32,618
but in the name of my son,
the King in the North,

750
00:45:32,653 --> 00:45:34,687
stand down.

751
00:45:36,223 --> 00:45:37,990
When your son returns,

752
00:45:38,025 --> 00:45:40,426
<i>I will demand</i>
<i>this murderer's head.</i>

753
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:42,695
Wise men do not
make demands of kings.

754
00:45:42,729 --> 00:45:45,931
Fathers who love
their sons do.

755
00:45:45,965 --> 00:45:48,300
I will have his head.

756
00:45:49,802 --> 00:45:53,705
Thank you for fighting
on my behalf, Lady Stark.

757
00:45:53,739 --> 00:45:55,573
I would have come
to your defense, but--

758
00:45:55,608 --> 00:45:58,275
Take him to the stockades.

759
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:00,511
Bind him with every chain
you can find!

760
00:46:00,545 --> 00:46:02,045
You've become a real she-wolf
in your later years.

761
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:04,248
There's not much fish
left in you.

762
00:46:04,282 --> 00:46:05,983
And gag him!

763
00:46:10,254 --> 00:46:13,356
Since when do you light
your own candles?

764
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:15,725
Since I decided that
I can't stand to look

765
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,295
at any of my handmaidens
for another instant.

766
00:46:20,665 --> 00:46:23,767
How many times can you
read one raven scroll?

767
00:46:23,801 --> 00:46:27,471
Stannis Baratheon's fleet
has been spotted sailing north

768
00:46:27,505 --> 00:46:30,141
past Tarth-- 200 ships.

769
00:46:30,175 --> 00:46:34,312
- More than we have.
- Yes, that's more than we have.

770
00:46:34,346 --> 00:46:36,714
He'll be at our gates
within five days,

771
00:46:36,748 --> 00:46:38,449
four if he has the wind.

772
00:46:38,484 --> 00:46:41,219
We have strong,
high walls.

773
00:46:41,253 --> 00:46:44,322
We'll rain fire
down on them from above.

774
00:46:44,356 --> 00:46:46,491
"Rain fire on them
from above."

775
00:46:46,525 --> 00:46:48,359
You're quoting father,
aren't you?

776
00:46:48,393 --> 00:46:49,827
Why not?

777
00:46:49,862 --> 00:46:51,762
He has a good mind
for strategy, doesn't he?

778
00:46:51,797 --> 00:46:54,565
We call it tactics,
not strategy.

779
00:46:54,599 --> 00:46:56,734
But, yes, he does have
a good mind for it.

780
00:46:56,768 --> 00:46:58,603
The best mind,
some would say.

781
00:46:58,637 --> 00:47:00,605
Sadly, he's not here.

782
00:47:01,573 --> 00:47:03,908
It's just you,
me, and Joffrey,

783
00:47:03,942 --> 00:47:06,110
the Lord
of the Seven Kingdoms

784
00:47:06,145 --> 00:47:07,912
and protector of the realm.

785
00:47:09,682 --> 00:47:11,382
I'm sure you'll make
a point eventually.

786
00:47:11,416 --> 00:47:14,785
He needs to start
acting like a king.

787
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:17,988
This war you started
is coming to our doorstep.

788
00:47:18,023 --> 00:47:20,324
And if the entire city
wants Joffrey dead--

789
00:47:20,358 --> 00:47:22,626
I'm not the one giving
the boy whores to abuse.

790
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:24,761
I thought the girls
might help him.

791
00:47:24,795 --> 00:47:27,196
- Did you?
- <i>I was wrong.</i>

792
00:47:29,932 --> 00:47:32,500
If we can't
control him...

793
00:47:32,535 --> 00:47:34,135
Do you think
I haven't tried?

794
00:47:36,572 --> 00:47:39,374
He doesn't listen to me.

795
00:47:41,077 --> 00:47:44,112
It's hard to put
a leash on a dog

796
00:47:44,146 --> 00:47:46,881
once you've put
a crown on its head.

797
00:47:50,085 --> 00:47:52,920
I always hoped
he'd be like Jaime.

798
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:57,225
He looks like him...

799
00:48:00,264 --> 00:48:02,965
in a certain light.

800
00:48:05,302 --> 00:48:07,304
The boy is more
Robert than Jaime.

801
00:48:07,338 --> 00:48:11,308
Robert was a drunken fool,
but he didn't enjoy cruelty.

802
00:48:13,244 --> 00:48:16,413
Sometimes I wonder...

803
00:48:16,447 --> 00:48:18,848
What?

804
00:48:18,883 --> 00:48:22,285
If this is the price

805
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:26,655
for what we've done,
for our sins.

806
00:48:26,689 --> 00:48:28,724
Sins?

807
00:48:28,758 --> 00:48:30,292
The Targaryens--

808
00:48:30,326 --> 00:48:31,905
Wed brother and sister
for hundreds of years,

809
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:33,930
I know.

810
00:48:35,632 --> 00:48:39,201
That's what Jaime and I would say to
each other in our moments of doubt.

811
00:48:39,236 --> 00:48:43,206
It's what I told Ned Stark when he
was stupid enough to confront me.

812
00:48:45,176 --> 00:48:48,379
Half the Targaryens
went mad, didn't they?

813
00:48:48,413 --> 00:48:49,814
What's the saying?

814
00:48:49,848 --> 00:48:54,385
Every time a Targaryen is born,
the Gods flip a coin.

815
00:48:54,419 --> 00:48:56,921
You've beaten the odds.

816
00:48:56,955 --> 00:48:59,556
Tommen and Myrcella
are good, decent children,

817
00:48:59,591 --> 00:49:01,425
both of them.

818
00:49:03,527 --> 00:49:05,662
( Crying )

819
00:49:28,884 --> 00:49:31,685
- Why wait?
- We're sworn to the king.

820
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:34,488
- There's not a king.
- That's treason.

821
00:49:34,523 --> 00:49:36,690
So is saving
Lannisters, yeah?

822
00:49:36,724 --> 00:49:39,492
- Back off, you.
- No, I won't.

823
00:49:39,527 --> 00:49:42,028
Your son returns
at dawn, My Lady?

824
00:49:42,063 --> 00:49:43,630
So they say.

825
00:49:43,664 --> 00:49:46,500
Brienne: <i>The Kingslayer</i>
<i>won't last the night.</i>

826
00:49:46,534 --> 00:49:48,868
<i>The more they drink,</i>
<i>the angrier they'll get.</i>

827
00:49:50,104 --> 00:49:52,271
And when the Karstarks
draw their swords...

828
00:49:52,306 --> 00:49:55,741
<i>who wants to die</i>
<i>defending a Lannister?</i>

829
00:49:56,710 --> 00:49:58,345
Come.

830
00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:16,631
I need to be alone
with him.

831
00:50:16,666 --> 00:50:20,535
- My Lady, our orders--
- your orders, which I just gave you,

832
00:50:20,569 --> 00:50:23,137
are to leave me
alone with him.

833
00:50:28,043 --> 00:50:30,277
Come to say goodbye,
Lady Stark?

834
00:50:30,312 --> 00:50:35,116
I believe it's my last night
in this world.

835
00:50:35,151 --> 00:50:36,584
Is that a woman?

836
00:50:36,619 --> 00:50:39,387
Do you hear them
out there?

837
00:50:39,422 --> 00:50:42,057
They want your head.

838
00:50:42,091 --> 00:50:45,560
Well, old Lord Karstark
doesn't seem to like me.

839
00:50:45,594 --> 00:50:48,830
You strangled his son
with your chains.

840
00:50:48,865 --> 00:50:51,133
Oh, oh.

841
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,801
Was he the one
on guard duty?

842
00:50:52,835 --> 00:50:55,370
<i>( Sighs )</i>

843
00:50:55,405 --> 00:50:57,206
He was in my way.

844
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:58,840
Any Knight would have
done the same.

845
00:50:58,875 --> 00:51:01,043
You are no Knight.

846
00:51:01,077 --> 00:51:03,646
You have forsaken
every vow you ever took.

847
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,447
So many vows.

848
00:51:05,482 --> 00:51:07,249
They make you swear
and swear.

849
00:51:07,283 --> 00:51:10,084
<i>Defend the king,</i>
<i>obey the king,</i>

850
00:51:10,119 --> 00:51:11,653
<i>obey your father,</i>

851
00:51:11,687 --> 00:51:14,956
protect the innocent,
defend the weak.

852
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:18,826
But what if your father
despises the king?

853
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:22,463
What if the king
massacres the innocent?

854
00:51:22,497 --> 00:51:24,699
It's too much.

855
00:51:24,733 --> 00:51:28,269
No matter what you do,
you're forsaking one vow or another.

856
00:51:28,303 --> 00:51:31,138
Where did you find
this beast?

857
00:51:32,407 --> 00:51:35,376
She is a truer Knight
than you will ever be,

858
00:51:35,411 --> 00:51:37,712
Kingslayer.

859
00:51:37,746 --> 00:51:40,348
Kingslayer.

860
00:51:40,382 --> 00:51:42,683
What a king he was.

861
00:51:42,718 --> 00:51:46,388
<i>Here's to Aerys Targaryen,</i>
<i>the second of his name,</i>

862
00:51:46,422 --> 00:51:49,591
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,
Protector of the realm,

863
00:51:49,626 --> 00:51:53,596
and to the sword
I shoved in his back.

864
00:51:54,798 --> 00:51:57,833
You are a man
without honor.

865
00:51:59,202 --> 00:52:01,337
Do you know

866
00:52:01,371 --> 00:52:04,607
I've never been with
any woman but Cersei?

867
00:52:04,641 --> 00:52:07,476
So in my own way,

868
00:52:07,478 --> 00:52:12,649
I have more honor
than poor old dead Ned.

869
00:52:14,285 --> 00:52:16,520
What was the name of that
bastard so in he fathered?

870
00:52:16,554 --> 00:52:20,158
- Brienne.
- No, that wasn't it.

871
00:52:20,192 --> 00:52:24,362
Snow, a bastard
from the North.

872
00:52:24,397 --> 00:52:27,166
Now, when--
when good old Ned

873
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:30,603
came home with
some whore's baby,

874
00:52:30,637 --> 00:52:33,806
did you pretend
to love it?

875
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:38,010
<i>No. You're not very good</i>
<i>at pretending.</i>

876
00:52:38,044 --> 00:52:40,212
<i>You're an honest woman.</i>

877
00:52:40,246 --> 00:52:43,615
You hated that boy,
didn't you?

878
00:52:43,649 --> 00:52:46,084
<i>How could you not</i>
<i>hate him?</i>

879
00:52:46,118 --> 00:52:48,719
<i>The walking,</i>
<i>talking reminder</i>

880
00:52:48,787 --> 00:52:52,422
that the honorable
Lord Eddark Stark

881
00:52:52,457 --> 00:52:55,192
fucked another woman.

882
00:52:57,529 --> 00:52:59,830
Your sword.

883
00:53:04,203 --> 00:53:07,540
I told you
what would happen.

884
00:53:07,574 --> 00:53:09,842
All of you--

885
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:15,815
I told you what would happen
if you served me loyally...

886
00:53:15,850 --> 00:53:18,018
<i>and what would happen</i>
<i>if you did not.</i>

887
00:53:18,052 --> 00:53:20,887
What are you doing?
What have you done?

888
00:53:20,921 --> 00:53:23,122
If there's any who still question
whether your new lord

889
00:53:23,157 --> 00:53:24,791
means what he says...

890
00:53:27,428 --> 00:53:30,430
Here is the answer
to your question.

892
00:53:39,641 --> 00:53:41,976
No!
