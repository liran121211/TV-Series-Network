2
00:02:04,182 --> 00:02:06,811
(indistinct voices)

3
00:02:19,789 --> 00:02:21,034
Boy.

4
00:02:22,078 --> 00:02:23,451
Lovely boy.

5
00:02:24,109 --> 00:02:25,282
What do you want?

6
00:02:25,811 --> 00:02:27,360
A man has a thirst.

7
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,778
The man does not drink
for a day and a night.

8
00:02:30,001 --> 00:02:32,113
A boy could make a friend.

9
00:02:32,372 --> 00:02:33,639
I have friends.

10
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:37,137
Give us a beer. Before I skin you.

11
00:02:37,681 --> 00:02:39,606
A man does not choose his companions.

12
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,543
These two, they have no courtesy.

13
00:02:41,871 --> 00:02:43,515
A man must ask forgiveness.

14
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,468
You're called Arry.

15
00:02:51,065 --> 00:02:53,788
This man has the honor to be Jaqen H'ghar.

16
00:02:54,011 --> 00:02:55,396
Once of the Free City of Lorath.

17
00:02:55,516 --> 00:02:57,321
Hey, you little shit.

18
00:02:57,441 --> 00:02:59,281
Get us beer!

19
00:02:59,401 --> 00:03:00,936
You should have asked nicely.

20
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:07,755
Come closer.

21
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:11,757
And I'll shove that stick up your
bunghole and fuck you bloody.

22
00:03:11,877 --> 00:03:13,999
The boy has more courage than sense.

23
00:03:14,119 --> 00:03:15,349
Come here!

24
00:03:15,469 --> 00:03:17,855
Yoren said none of us were
should go near of those three.

25
00:03:18,137 --> 00:03:19,440
They don't scare me.

26
00:03:19,956 --> 00:03:21,247
Then you're stupid.

27
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,055
They scare me.

28
00:03:27,301 --> 00:03:29,965
Would a gold collector look
this far from King's Landing?

29
00:03:35,036 --> 00:03:36,104
What are you doing?

30
00:03:36,144 --> 00:03:37,172
They're looking for me.

31
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,487
You're in command here?

32
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,657
You're a long way from home.

33
00:03:43,277 --> 00:03:44,535
I asked you a question.

34
00:03:45,136 --> 00:03:46,310
Aye, you did.

35
00:03:47,831 --> 00:03:49,540
You asked without manners.

36
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:51,851
And I chose not to answer.

37
00:03:52,505 --> 00:03:54,298
I have a royal warrant.

38
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,129
For one of these gutter
rats you're transporting.

39
00:04:01,163 --> 00:04:03,153
Well the thing is,

40
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:07,050
these gutter rats belong
to the Night's Watch now.

41
00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:10,191
That puts them beyond the
reach of kings and queens.

42
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,135
It's a funny thing.

43
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:16,351
People worry so much about their throats,

44
00:04:16,388 --> 00:04:18,473
they forget about what's down low.

45
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,657
Now I sharpened this
blade before breakfast.

46
00:04:23,493 --> 00:04:26,629
I could shave a spider's
arse if I wanted to.

47
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:28,460
Or,

48
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:31,000
I could nick this artery in your leg

49
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,629
and once it's nicked, there's no one
around here who knows how to un-nick it.

50
00:04:37,492 --> 00:04:39,313
We'll just keep that.

51
00:04:41,266 --> 00:04:43,510
Good steel is always needed on the wall.

52
00:04:44,356 --> 00:04:46,121
Seems you have a choice.

53
00:04:46,794 --> 00:04:50,212
You can die here at this
crossroads a long way from home.

54
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,981
Or you can go back to your
city and tell your masters

55
00:04:53,019 --> 00:04:55,366
you didn't find what you were looking for.

56
00:05:01,628 --> 00:05:03,571
We're looking for a boy named Gendry.

57
00:05:04,116 --> 00:05:06,069
He carries a bull's head helmet.

58
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:10,596
Anyone turning him over will
earn the King's reward.

59
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,762
We'll be back. With more men.

60
00:05:13,882 --> 00:05:16,814
And I'll be taking your head home
along with that bastard boy.

61
00:05:31,117 --> 00:05:33,258
(Tyrion whistling)

62
00:05:46,632 --> 00:05:47,740
(woman laughing)

63
00:05:51,456 --> 00:05:52,695
My lord.

64
00:05:52,724 --> 00:05:54,123
You make me wait a long time.

65
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,057
And your friend keeps me company.

66
00:05:56,874 --> 00:05:58,705
We were just speaking of your bravery

67
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:01,625
in the victory against the
Stark auxiliary forces.

68
00:06:02,849 --> 00:06:04,286
It was quite a battle.

69
00:06:05,356 --> 00:06:08,455
I heard you suffered a terrible head wound.

70
00:06:08,755 --> 00:06:11,675
The northerners are such fearsome warriors.

71
00:06:12,148 --> 00:06:14,543
And I tell him the story of how we meet.

72
00:06:15,425 --> 00:06:19,219
To find such a lovely creature
working in your father's kitchen.

73
00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:21,566
It almost beggars belief.

74
00:06:22,364 --> 00:06:23,707
Strange things do happen.

75
00:06:24,646 --> 00:06:26,486
You should taste her fish pie.

76
00:06:26,956 --> 00:06:29,237
I don't think Lord Varys likes fish pie.

77
00:06:29,357 --> 00:06:30,702
How can you tell?

78
00:06:30,909 --> 00:06:32,186
I can always tell.

79
00:06:32,685 --> 00:06:35,887
Men like Lord Varys and I can't let
our disadvantages get the best of us.

80
00:06:36,432 --> 00:06:37,990
We'll make a fisherman of him yet.

81
00:06:38,976 --> 00:06:43,192
I am glad your new friend was able
to accompany you to the capital.

82
00:06:43,973 --> 00:06:46,855
Friends are such an important part of life.

83
00:06:47,973 --> 00:06:50,658
Unfortunate that your father
didn't want her to come.

84
00:06:50,968 --> 00:06:52,724
But rest easy my lord,

85
00:06:53,556 --> 00:06:57,059
I am very good at keeping
secrets for my good friends.

86
00:06:57,857 --> 00:06:59,707
Your discretion is legendary,

87
00:07:00,167 --> 00:07:01,106
where your friends are concerned.

88
00:07:01,489 --> 00:07:06,062
How unspeakable of me to go on and
on, when all you want to do is rest.

89
00:07:06,182 --> 00:07:06,935
I will leave you.

90
00:07:09,367 --> 00:07:11,700
Welcome to Kings Landing, my dear.

91
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,545
The city is made brighter by your presence.

92
00:07:14,665 --> 00:07:16,629
We have a council meeting, my lord.

93
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:21,647
I don't like threats.

94
00:07:22,513 --> 00:07:23,790
Who threatened you?

95
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,725
I'm not Ned Stark.
I understand the way this game is played.

96
00:07:26,845 --> 00:07:29,512
Ned Stark was a man of honor. And I am not.

97
00:07:29,632 --> 00:07:32,591
Threaten me again and I will
have you thrown into the sea.

98
00:07:35,898 --> 00:07:38,397
You might be disappointed in the results.

99
00:07:39,062 --> 00:07:41,123
The storms come and go.

100
00:07:41,496 --> 00:07:43,310
The big fish eat the little fish.

101
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,882
And I keep on paddling.

102
00:07:47,355 --> 00:07:48,851
Come, my lord.

103
00:07:48,971 --> 00:07:51,769
We shouldn't keep the queen waiting.

104
00:07:56,768 --> 00:08:00,325
From this time until the end of time,
we are not part of your realm,

105
00:08:00,445 --> 00:08:03,662
but a free and independent
Kingdom of the North.

106
00:08:07,727 --> 00:08:10,061
He has more spirit than his
father, I'll give him that.

107
00:08:10,181 --> 00:08:12,924
You've perfected the art
of tearing up papers.

108
00:08:13,271 --> 00:08:17,082
Give him his father's bones back, at
least as a gesture of good faith.

109
00:08:17,492 --> 00:08:19,480
You'll give the Starks our reply, cousin?

110
00:08:20,255 --> 00:08:22,079
I will, Your Grace.

111
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:25,599
Did you see my brother when
you were the Starks guest?

112
00:08:25,719 --> 00:08:26,748
I did.

113
00:08:27,181 --> 00:08:29,078
They have not broken his
spirit, Your Grace.

114
00:08:30,318 --> 00:08:32,069
If you speak with him,

115
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,169
tell him he's not been forgotten.

116
00:08:35,952 --> 00:08:37,138
I will, Your Grace.

117
00:08:37,258 --> 00:08:38,369
Safe travels, cousin.

118
00:08:42,793 --> 00:08:44,872
You have a deft hand with diplomacy.

119
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:45,967
If that's everything?

120
00:08:46,087 --> 00:08:50,763
A raven flew in this
morning from Castle Black.

121
00:08:51,036 --> 00:08:53,061
Trouble with the wildlings?

122
00:08:53,181 --> 00:08:55,570
That's why they're called wildlings.

123
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,649
Somewhat less wild these days.

124
00:08:58,142 --> 00:09:01,497
It seems they've stopped killing each
other and started following this

125
00:09:01,617 --> 00:09:02,884
King-Beyond-the-Wall.

126
00:09:03,004 --> 00:09:06,864
Another king? How many is that now?
Five? I've lost count.

127
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:10,751
Lord Commander asks that we
send more men to man The Wall.

128
00:09:10,871 --> 00:09:14,087
Perhaps he's forgotten we're fighting a war.
We have no men to spare.

129
00:09:14,207 --> 00:09:18,534
Cold winds are rising, and
the dead rise with them.

130
00:09:18,654 --> 00:09:21,982
The northerners are a superstitious people.

131
00:09:22,409 --> 00:09:25,914
According to the Commander, one of these
dead men attacked him in his chambers.

132
00:09:26,285 --> 00:09:28,051
Mormont doesn't lie.

133
00:09:28,707 --> 00:09:30,787
How do you kill a dead man?

134
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,321
Apparently you burn him.

135
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,604
One trip to The Wall and you come back

136
00:09:36,724 --> 00:09:40,507
believing in grumpkins and snarks.

137
00:09:40,627 --> 00:09:42,427
I don't know what I believe,

138
00:09:42,547 --> 00:09:44,718
but here's a fact for you.

139
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,790
The Night's Watch is the
only thing that separates us

140
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,272
from what lies beyond the Wall.

141
00:09:49,392 --> 00:09:54,014
I have every confidence the brave men of
the Night's Watch will protect us all.

142
00:09:55,576 --> 00:09:57,235
Night, sir.

143
00:09:57,355 --> 00:09:59,415
The gods wanted us to have dignity,

144
00:09:59,535 --> 00:10:01,348
wouldn't make us fart when we died.

145
00:10:03,293 --> 00:10:04,752
We fart when we die?

146
00:10:05,591 --> 00:10:09,603
My blessed mother was holding her
own when she left this world.

147
00:10:09,968 --> 00:10:12,411
She farted so hard, the whole bed shook.

148
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,405
(farting noises)

149
00:10:21,943 --> 00:10:25,134
Seems a bit greedy for one
man to have so many wives.

150
00:10:25,254 --> 00:10:27,688
We were having a serious discussion.

151
00:10:28,052 --> 00:10:29,840
Wouldn't two or three be enough for him?

152
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,615
Would you look at that.

153
00:10:35,028 --> 00:10:37,581
Nothing like the sight
of a woman walking away.

154
00:10:37,701 --> 00:10:40,061
I prefer watching them come towards me.

155
00:10:40,632 --> 00:10:42,401
I'm sure that's nice too.

156
00:10:42,521 --> 00:10:44,224
Well, there was a milkmaid

157
00:10:44,446 --> 00:10:47,025
named Violet on the next farm
over from where I grew up.

158
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:51,006
And we were wrestling together from
the time we were six years old.

159
00:10:51,343 --> 00:10:52,820
And then we got older,

160
00:10:53,358 --> 00:10:57,935
the wrestling, uh …changed.

161
00:10:58,254 --> 00:11:00,296
You were with her?

162
00:11:00,843 --> 00:11:02,339
How many times?

163
00:11:02,813 --> 00:11:04,527
Well, as many times as I could.

164
00:11:07,768 --> 00:11:09,991
Wish I'd grew up on a farm.

165
00:11:10,111 --> 00:11:11,815
We need more potatoes.

166
00:11:11,935 --> 00:11:13,954
I'll get another sack for the sludge.

167
00:11:17,266 --> 00:11:18,944
Get the turnips too.

168
00:11:30,478 --> 00:11:33,363
No, Ghost, no!

169
00:11:33,483 --> 00:11:35,216
No.

170
00:11:36,106 --> 00:11:39,098
Ghost, away. Shoo.
Shoo!

171
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:44,156
You all right?

172
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:47,505
- Did he frighten you?
- You shouldn't touch me.

173
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:50,710
Oh, oh. Right.

174
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:54,419
I'm sorry. I just wanted to
make sure you weren't hurt.

175
00:12:01,357 --> 00:12:02,451
You're very brave.

176
00:12:12,192 --> 00:12:13,724
What's he doing?

177
00:12:14,727 --> 00:12:15,913
This is Gilly,

178
00:12:16,033 --> 00:12:18,913
she's one of Craster's daughters.

179
00:12:19,351 --> 00:12:21,047
Hello, Gilly. What's he doing?

180
00:12:21,167 --> 00:12:22,306
Sam said you could help.

181
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:24,198
I'm sorry, Sam knows we're not supposed...

182
00:12:24,318 --> 00:12:25,347
She's pregnant.

183
00:12:32,296 --> 00:12:34,868
We have to take her with us, when we leave.

184
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:35,944
What?

185
00:12:36,746 --> 00:12:38,469
I know it sounds a bit mad.

186
00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:40,311
No it doesn't sound a bit
mad, it's impossible.

187
00:12:40,431 --> 00:12:42,259
- The Lord Commander...
- We are sworn to protect.

188
00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:44,702
- Sam we can't take her.
- Please sir, please.

189
00:12:44,822 --> 00:12:46,458
I can still run if I have to.

190
00:12:46,578 --> 00:12:47,719
It's just not possible.

191
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,290
I'm going to have a baby,
if it's a boy I...

192
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,711
If it's a boy, what?

193
00:12:58,254 --> 00:13:01,919
You want us to risk our lives for you,
and you won't even tell us why.

194
00:13:07,731 --> 00:13:09,044
Why did you do that?

195
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:10,667
Do what, ask her a question?

196
00:13:10,787 --> 00:13:12,176
- You were cruel.
- Cruel!?

197
00:13:12,596 --> 00:13:14,802
Sam are you in such a hurry to lose a hand?

198
00:13:14,922 --> 00:13:16,745
- I didn't touch her!
- No you just want to steal her,

199
00:13:16,865 --> 00:13:18,331
what do you think Craster
cuts off for that?

200
00:13:18,451 --> 00:13:19,878
I can't steal her,

201
00:13:20,242 --> 00:13:22,668
she's a person not a goat.

202
00:13:27,252 --> 00:13:30,043
We're heading deeper and deeper
into wildling territory.

203
00:13:30,444 --> 00:13:32,085
We can't take a girl with us.

204
00:13:32,205 --> 00:13:34,310
Mormont wouldn't have it.
And even if he would,

205
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,897
what would we do with her?

206
00:13:36,017 --> 00:13:37,885
Who's gonna deliver her baby? You?

207
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:40,343
I could try...

208
00:13:40,817 --> 00:13:42,915
What? I've read about it.

209
00:13:44,292 --> 00:13:45,842
A bit.

210
00:13:47,602 --> 00:13:48,824
I'm sorry Sam,

211
00:13:49,909 --> 00:13:51,350
we can't help her.

212
00:14:45,568 --> 00:14:47,136
Khaleesi.

213
00:15:30,936 --> 00:15:33,689
- You don't need to see this.
- He is blood of my blood.

214
00:15:36,188 --> 00:15:37,774
Who did this?

215
00:15:38,057 --> 00:15:39,625
Khal Pono perhaps,

216
00:15:39,745 --> 00:15:41,613
Khal Jhaqo...

217
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:44,582
They don't like the idea of a
woman leading a Khalasaar.

218
00:15:44,702 --> 00:15:47,552
They will like it far less
when I'm done with them.

219
00:17:16,391 --> 00:17:18,443
Is it as you remember my lord?

220
00:17:18,563 --> 00:17:20,324
Looks smaller.

221
00:17:20,444 --> 00:17:22,347
Everything looks bigger
when you're a child.

222
00:17:22,467 --> 00:17:25,681
I remember my father's cabin, felt
like a palace when I was little.

223
00:17:26,137 --> 00:17:27,761
Now look at it...

224
00:17:29,028 --> 00:17:31,034
They'll be waiting for me on the docks.

225
00:17:31,154 --> 00:17:32,694
Who will?

226
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:34,605
Anyone who matters,

227
00:17:34,725 --> 00:17:36,215
this is a big day for them.

228
00:17:36,335 --> 00:17:39,425
They haven't had much to get
excited about since I left.

229
00:17:40,087 --> 00:17:42,302
It's a hard place the Iron Islands...

230
00:17:42,422 --> 00:17:43,980
always has been.

231
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,059
It's cold and it's wet.

232
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:47,650
I love the cold and wet.

233
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:50,422
They say hard places breed hard men,

234
00:17:50,701 --> 00:17:54,038
and hard men rule the world.

235
00:17:56,124 --> 00:17:58,774
Then you'll be king before long.

236
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:02,957
Try smiling with your lips closed.

237
00:18:03,531 --> 00:18:05,811
Hmm, better.

238
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,159
My father doesn't trust you Iron islanders.

239
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:12,843
I don't blame him.

240
00:18:12,963 --> 00:18:15,986
He says that you're all reavers and rapers.

241
00:18:16,106 --> 00:18:18,010
And that no matter how many women you have,

242
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,702
you'll never be satis...

243
00:18:19,822 --> 00:18:22,527
Quit talking about your father.

244
00:18:22,647 --> 00:18:24,821
He's right about us.

245
00:18:24,941 --> 00:18:28,129
Our wives from the Iron Islands,

246
00:18:28,468 --> 00:18:31,860
they're for breeding.
That's not enough for us.

247
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:35,950
That's why we take saltwives
from the women we capture.

248
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:39,105
Capture me!
Take me with you when you go ashore.

249
00:18:39,225 --> 00:18:43,149
- Make me your saltwife.
- Your place is on this ship.

250
00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:45,053
Not after you leave.

251
00:18:45,173 --> 00:18:49,194
Father will punish me.
He'll call me a whore.

252
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:51,578
I haven't paid you.

253
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:31,053
I barely touched her.

254
00:19:31,354 --> 00:19:33,688
And you charge twice as much
as every other brothel.

255
00:19:33,808 --> 00:19:36,533
- And this is what I get, crying.
- One moment, my friend.

256
00:19:36,653 --> 00:19:37,588
A moment.

257
00:19:46,433 --> 00:19:48,762
Please accept my sincerest apologies.

258
00:19:48,882 --> 00:19:50,424
Ramka will take good care of you.

259
00:20:19,222 --> 00:20:22,631
- Sorry my lord.
- Shhh.

260
00:20:25,008 --> 00:20:26,189
Did he hurt you?

261
00:20:28,345 --> 00:20:29,680
Not, my lord.

262
00:20:32,058 --> 00:20:34,191
- It's Megan.
- Who?

263
00:20:36,646 --> 00:20:37,920
She works for you.

264
00:20:38,918 --> 00:20:44,335
She's the one, the girl whose,
they killed her baby.

265
00:20:44,455 --> 00:20:49,347
Ah, yes, that was
poorly handled.

266
00:20:51,649 --> 00:20:54,871
Sometimes those with the
most power have the least grace.

267
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,738
Can't stop thinking about it,

268
00:20:59,512 --> 00:21:01,138
I can't sleep.

269
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,837
Her poor little baby.

270
00:21:06,134 --> 00:21:08,205
You know you remind
me of another girl?

271
00:21:09,358 --> 00:21:12,310
A lovely thing I once acquired
from an Elysium pleasure house.

272
00:21:13,779 --> 00:21:16,540
Beautiful, like yourself,

273
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:20,238
and intelligent as yourself.

274
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,320
But she wasn't happy.

275
00:21:23,973 --> 00:21:28,753
She cried, often.
I asked her why but,

276
00:21:30,675 --> 00:21:33,471
we didn't have the kind of
rapport that you and I have.

277
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,727
Yes, it was quite sad.

278
00:21:41,151 --> 00:21:43,805
Girls from Elysium pleasure
houses are expensive.

279
00:21:44,342 --> 00:21:45,876
Extremely expensive.

280
00:21:46,521 --> 00:21:49,114
And this one wasn't making me any money.

281
00:21:53,394 --> 00:21:55,557
I hate bad investments.

282
00:21:56,562 --> 00:21:58,726
Really, I do.

283
00:21:58,846 --> 00:22:00,843
They haunt me.

284
00:22:04,864 --> 00:22:07,005
I had no idea how to make her happy,

285
00:22:08,132 --> 00:22:10,434
no idea how to mitigate my losses.

286
00:22:12,552 --> 00:22:16,154
A very wealthy patron, he offered me
a tremendous amount of money

287
00:22:16,274 --> 00:22:21,325
to let him transform
this lovely, sad girl.

288
00:22:21,623 --> 00:22:26,733
To use her in ways that
never occur to most men.

289
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:30,753
And you know what occurs to most men.

290
00:22:34,844 --> 00:22:37,801
I wouldn't say he succeeded
in making her happy

291
00:22:39,475 --> 00:22:43,144
but my losses were definitely mitigated.

292
00:22:51,065 --> 00:22:53,290
Take tonight off.
Tomorrow, Megan's child

293
00:22:54,862 --> 00:22:56,174
will see you tomorrow.

294
00:22:56,746 --> 00:22:58,388
Better be happy.

295
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:03,866
That makes me happy.

296
00:23:16,172 --> 00:23:17,443
More wine?

297
00:23:18,211 --> 00:23:20,727
- Damn it, boy!
- Apologies, my lord.

298
00:23:20,847 --> 00:23:21,851
Leave us, Podrik.

299
00:23:21,883 --> 00:23:23,591
I believe we know
how to pour our own wine.

300
00:23:25,165 --> 00:23:28,355
Is that your new squire?
Could have found you a proper lad.

301
00:23:28,475 --> 00:23:31,229
Myself, I prefer the improper ones.

302
00:23:31,475 --> 00:23:33,064
Hmm, that's a good red.

303
00:23:33,184 --> 00:23:35,765
- Dornish?
- You know your wines, my lord.

304
00:23:35,885 --> 00:23:36,563
That I do.

305
00:23:38,327 --> 00:23:39,739
A fine dinner, my lord.

306
00:23:39,859 --> 00:23:41,142
Call me Tyrion, please.

307
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:44,671
I'm sure you're getting used to
fine dinners, now that you're a lord.

308
00:23:45,146 --> 00:23:46,788
Maybe I'll hire this cook of yours.

309
00:23:47,049 --> 00:23:49,619
Wars have been started for less.

310
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,020
I heard there was some trouble

311
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,769
in Littlefinger's brothel the other night.

312
00:23:54,076 --> 00:23:56,669
Hmm. Nasty business,
had to be done.

313
00:23:56,789 --> 00:23:57,682
Yes, of course.

314
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,330
City Watch must keep the peace.

315
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:03,826
Only, I hadn't realized peace
depended on killing babies.

316
00:24:04,722 --> 00:24:07,012
- Orders are orders.
- Quite right.

317
00:24:07,163 --> 00:24:08,942
Especially the queen's orders.

318
00:24:09,013 --> 00:24:10,752
I never said they were the queen's orders.

319
00:24:10,832 --> 00:24:14,674
No, but who else would want
to murder King Robert's bastards?

320
00:24:15,356 --> 00:24:18,490
- She's always been a jealous woman.
- You know your sister better than I do.

321
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:20,792
You've heard the awful rumors
about my brother and sister.

322
00:24:20,912 --> 00:24:21,913
I don't listen to filth.

323
00:24:22,033 --> 00:24:25,226
That's good of you,
but you have heard them.

324
00:24:25,639 --> 00:24:27,514
I suppose people
who do believe that filth,

325
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:29,347
consider Robert's bastards
to be better claimants

326
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:30,973
to the throne than
Cersei's children.

327
00:24:31,093 --> 00:24:33,120
Joffrey is my king,
the rest doesn't interest me.

328
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,655
I appreciate your loyalty.

329
00:24:36,221 --> 00:24:37,203
Tell me.

330
00:24:37,955 --> 00:24:41,126
When your men slaughtered
Ned Stark's men in the throne room,

331
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:43,188
did you give the order?

332
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:45,207
I did.

333
00:24:45,327 --> 00:24:47,063
And I would again.

334
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:51,391
The man was a traitor.
He tried to buy my loyalty.

335
00:24:51,511 --> 00:24:52,480
The fool.

336
00:24:53,468 --> 00:24:55,386
He had no idea you
were already bought.

337
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:57,166
Are you drunk?

338
00:24:57,734 --> 00:25:00,051
I'll not have my honor
questioned by an Imp.

339
00:25:00,171 --> 00:25:03,260
I'm not questioning
your honor, Lord Janos.

340
00:25:03,717 --> 00:25:05,707
I'm denying its existence.

341
00:25:05,827 --> 00:25:08,484
You think I'll stand here and
take this from you, dwarf.

342
00:25:08,604 --> 00:25:09,395
Dwarf?

343
00:25:09,837 --> 00:25:11,170
You should have stopped at imp.

344
00:25:11,537 --> 00:25:13,829
And yes, you will stand
here and take it from me,

345
00:25:13,949 --> 00:25:16,013
unless you'd like to take
it from my friend here.

346
00:25:17,332 --> 00:25:20,176
I intend to serve as Hand of the King
until my father returns from the war

347
00:25:20,446 --> 00:25:22,600
and seeing as you betrayed
the last Hand of the King,

348
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,501
well I just wouldn't feel
safe with you lurking about.

349
00:25:25,621 --> 00:25:26,740
What are you…

350
00:25:27,013 --> 00:25:28,817
My friends at court will not allow this.

351
00:25:28,937 --> 00:25:29,739
The queen herself...

352
00:25:29,859 --> 00:25:31,141
The queen regent.

353
00:25:31,261 --> 00:25:33,313
And you're a fool to
believe she's your friend.

354
00:25:33,939 --> 00:25:35,497
We shall hear what Joffrey
has to say about this.

355
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:36,652
No, we shan't.

356
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:47,128
There's a ship leaving for
East Watch by the Sea tonight.

357
00:25:47,469 --> 00:25:50,529
From there, I'm afraid it's rather
a long walk to Castle Black.

358
00:25:51,018 --> 00:25:52,269
I hope you enjoy the Wall.

359
00:25:52,826 --> 00:25:55,089
I found it surprisingly beautiful,

360
00:25:55,647 --> 00:25:59,070
in a brutal, horribly
uncomfortable sort of way.

361
00:25:59,369 --> 00:26:00,529
The lads will escort you.

362
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:02,645
The streets aren't safe at night, my lord.

363
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:04,654
These men are under my command.

364
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:07,213
I command you to arrest this cutthroat.

365
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:11,068
His name is Bronn and he is the
new commander of the City Watch.

366
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:12,786
Boys.

367
00:26:15,459 --> 00:26:16,971
I have friends at court.

368
00:26:17,449 --> 00:26:18,518
Powerful friends.

369
00:26:19,826 --> 00:26:21,532
The king himself made me a lord.

370
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:27,836
To the new Commander.

371
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:40,509
If I told you to murder, an infant girl
say, still at her mother's breast,

372
00:26:42,056 --> 00:26:43,682
would you do it without question?

373
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:47,654
Without question? No.

374
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:49,861
I'd ask how much.

375
00:27:07,486 --> 00:27:09,227
If they come back, I say we yield.

376
00:27:09,909 --> 00:27:10,808
Gendry's the one they want.

377
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,536
I don't want to get caught
in the middle of a battle.

378
00:27:12,959 --> 00:27:14,494
I'm not afraid of no battles.

379
00:27:14,614 --> 00:27:17,110
If you got within a mile of a
battle, you'd fill your pants.

380
00:27:17,383 --> 00:27:18,486
I've seen lots of battles.

381
00:27:18,884 --> 00:27:19,806
- I saw...
- Liar.

382
00:27:20,391 --> 00:27:24,656
I saw a man kill another man just
outside a tavern in Flea Bottom.

383
00:27:25,008 --> 00:27:26,669
Stabbed him right in the neck.

384
00:27:27,181 --> 00:27:29,001
Two men fighting isn't a battle.

385
00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:30,946
They had armor on.

386
00:27:31,702 --> 00:27:32,293
So?

387
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:34,909
So, if they got armor on, it's a battle.

388
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:35,887
No, it isn't.

389
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,118
What's a dyer's apprentice
know about battles anyway?

390
00:27:39,481 --> 00:27:40,834
Gendry's an armorer's apprentice.

391
00:27:41,676 --> 00:27:44,258
Hot Pie, tell Gendry what makes it a battle.

392
00:27:46,221 --> 00:27:48,617
It's when they've got armor on.

393
00:27:48,737 --> 00:27:49,638
I already told you that.

394
00:27:51,376 --> 00:27:52,295
A knight?

395
00:27:53,469 --> 00:27:54,338
How'd you know he was a knight?

396
00:27:56,581 --> 00:27:59,140
Well, cause they got armor on.

397
00:27:59,771 --> 00:28:01,368
You don't have to be a
knight to have armor.

398
00:28:01,709 --> 00:28:02,871
Any idiot can buy armor.

399
00:28:03,423 --> 00:28:04,127
How'd you know?

400
00:28:05,219 --> 00:28:06,440
Cause I sold armor.

401
00:28:19,377 --> 00:28:20,739
What do the gold-clips want with you?

402
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,113
No idea.

403
00:28:22,571 --> 00:28:23,416
You're a liar.

404
00:28:23,639 --> 00:28:25,588
You shouldn't insult people
that are bigger than you.

405
00:28:26,164 --> 00:28:27,855
Then I wouldn't get to insult anyone.

406
00:28:28,484 --> 00:28:29,694
No one gets to insult anyone.

407
00:28:30,621 --> 00:28:32,347
No good's ever come of those questions.

408
00:28:32,467 --> 00:28:33,639
No good's ever come?

409
00:28:34,785 --> 00:28:36,194
You've asked questions before?

410
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:39,452
How can someone so small be
such a huge pain in my ass?

411
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:40,837
Were you asked questions?

412
00:28:43,511 --> 00:28:46,377
The Hand of the King.
The Hands of the King.

413
00:28:47,776 --> 00:28:50,483
Lord Arryn came first, a
few weeks before he died.

414
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:53,854
And then Lord Stark came, a
few weeks before he died.

415
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,436
Lord Stark.

416
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:59,885
See? Asking me questions is bad luck.

417
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:03,101
You'll probably be dead soon.

418
00:29:04,477 --> 00:29:05,739
What did they ask about?

419
00:29:06,129 --> 00:29:08,481
- My mom.
- Who's your mom?

420
00:29:08,827 --> 00:29:10,297
Just my mom.

421
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:12,160
Worked in a tavern. Died when I was little.

422
00:29:12,504 --> 00:29:13,422
And who was your father?

423
00:29:13,844 --> 00:29:16,412
He could be one of those gold-hatted
bastards, for all I know.

424
00:29:16,895 --> 00:29:18,014
What about you, anyway?

425
00:29:19,206 --> 00:29:20,344
I thought they were after you?

426
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:22,546
Why?

427
00:29:23,921 --> 00:29:26,196
Did you kill someone?
Or is it just because you're a girl?

428
00:29:26,879 --> 00:29:27,778
I'm not a girl!

429
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:28,823
Yes you are.

430
00:29:29,539 --> 00:29:31,043
You think I'm as stupid
as the rest of them?

431
00:29:31,229 --> 00:29:34,188
Stupider. Night's Watch doesn't take girls.
Everyone knows that.

432
00:29:34,308 --> 00:29:35,563
That's true. You're still a girl.

433
00:29:35,645 --> 00:29:36,424
I am not!

434
00:29:36,462 --> 00:29:38,280
Well, pull your cock out
and take a piss then.

435
00:29:40,238 --> 00:29:41,310
I don't need to take a piss.

436
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,981
I'm in hot pike, aren't I now?

437
00:29:50,126 --> 00:29:50,874
No one can know.

438
00:29:51,344 --> 00:29:53,707
They won't. Not from me.

439
00:29:57,538 --> 00:29:58,624
My name's not Arry.

440
00:30:00,281 --> 00:30:03,143
It's Arya. Of House Stark.

441
00:30:04,494 --> 00:30:06,226
Yoren is taking me home to Winterfell.

442
00:30:07,708 --> 00:30:10,629
He was your father. The Hand. The traitor.

443
00:30:10,695 --> 00:30:11,884
He was never a traitor.

444
00:30:12,705 --> 00:30:13,787
Joffrey is a liar.

445
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:17,412
- So you're a highborn, then. You're a lady.
- No.

446
00:30:17,795 --> 00:30:18,569
I mean yes.

447
00:30:18,978 --> 00:30:20,618
My mother was a lady, and my sister.

448
00:30:20,656 --> 00:30:22,863
You were a lord's daughter
and you lived in a castle.

449
00:30:24,257 --> 00:30:25,812
Look, all that about cocks.
I should never have said that.

450
00:30:26,972 --> 00:30:28,650
I've been pissing in front
of you and everything.

451
00:30:30,236 --> 00:30:31,419
I should be calling you milady.

452
00:30:31,453 --> 00:30:32,800
Do not call me milady.

453
00:30:32,848 --> 00:30:33,790
As milady commands.

454
00:30:34,865 --> 00:30:35,779
Well, that was unladylike.

455
00:31:04,204 --> 00:31:05,243
What you carrying?

456
00:31:07,394 --> 00:31:08,499
Pears and oranges.

457
00:31:09,151 --> 00:31:10,121
Wine from the Arbor.

458
00:31:11,768 --> 00:31:13,776
And the heir to Pyke of the Iron Islands.

459
00:31:17,346 --> 00:31:20,155
The only living son of Balon Greyjoy.

460
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:24,635
Me.

461
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:27,867
Don't like wine.

462
00:31:28,858 --> 00:31:29,739
Woman's drink.

463
00:31:33,344 --> 00:31:34,446
I need to get to Pyke.

464
00:31:44,324 --> 00:31:45,793
I'll find you a horse.

465
00:31:56,487 --> 00:31:57,423
I'm heading that way.

466
00:31:58,323 --> 00:31:59,351
I can take you there.

467
00:32:00,673 --> 00:32:01,719
I bet you can.

468
00:32:02,436 --> 00:32:03,556
You been at sea long?

469
00:32:04,272 --> 00:32:06,310
Or were there just no women
where you came from?

470
00:32:06,688 --> 00:32:07,496
None like you.

471
00:32:07,845 --> 00:32:08,965
You don't know what I'm like.

472
00:32:09,424 --> 00:32:10,580
You don't know what you're like.

473
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,224
You need someone to teach you.

474
00:32:14,656 --> 00:32:15,795
Know who I am?

475
00:32:16,493 --> 00:32:19,210
You think I offer free rides
to every man in jewelry.

476
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,817
Lord Greyjoy.

477
00:32:24,658 --> 00:32:26,237
Have my things sent up to the castle.

478
00:32:43,502 --> 00:32:46,330
You should give me the reins,
I'm a better rider than you.

479
00:32:46,844 --> 00:32:48,533
I've been on horseback
for the last nine years.

480
00:32:49,029 --> 00:32:52,114
Nine years. You still know
your way around a ship?

481
00:32:52,844 --> 00:32:54,625
Have these hands ever touched a rope?

482
00:32:55,103 --> 00:32:56,590
Don't you worry about my hands.

483
00:32:58,995 --> 00:33:00,280
The sea's in my blood.

484
00:33:01,217 --> 00:33:03,622
You'll never be in the sea if I
don't watch where I'm going.

485
00:33:04,338 --> 00:33:05,954
I have a proposal for my father.

486
00:33:07,221 --> 00:33:09,332
One that will make him king again.

487
00:33:09,833 --> 00:33:11,118
And me after him.

488
00:33:14,001 --> 00:33:16,167
You may stay at the castle
tonight, if you're lucky.

489
00:33:16,902 --> 00:33:18,426
Is that an offer from my future king?

490
00:33:18,477 --> 00:33:20,313
An order. From your future king.

491
00:33:22,994 --> 00:33:24,968
You can tell your grandchildren
about this night.

492
00:33:25,633 --> 00:33:28,066
I don't imagine it will be
a story fit for children.

493
00:33:40,914 --> 00:33:42,016
Father.

494
00:33:43,416 --> 00:33:45,206
Nine years, is it?

495
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,373
They took a frightened boy.

496
00:33:49,108 --> 00:33:50,393
What have they given back?

497
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,423
A man.

498
00:33:54,249 --> 00:33:56,511
- Your blood and your heir.
- We shall see.

499
00:33:58,634 --> 00:34:00,672
Stark had you longer than I did.

500
00:34:01,747 --> 00:34:02,920
Lord Stark is gone.

501
00:34:05,304 --> 00:34:07,613
And how do you feel about that?

502
00:34:11,401 --> 00:34:12,259
What's done is done.

503
00:34:13,923 --> 00:34:15,497
I've brought you a
proposal from Robb Stark.

504
00:34:15,521 --> 00:34:16,964
Who gave you those clothes?

505
00:34:18,434 --> 00:34:21,608
Was it Ned Stark's pleasure
to make you his daughter?

506
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:24,645
If my clothes offend you,
I will change them.

507
00:34:24,685 --> 00:34:25,544
It will.

508
00:34:27,741 --> 00:34:29,422
That bauble around your neck.

509
00:34:29,813 --> 00:34:32,750
Did you pay the iron price
for it or the gold?

510
00:34:33,855 --> 00:34:35,253
I asked a question.

511
00:34:35,536 --> 00:34:38,062
Did you pull it from the
neck of a corpse you made

512
00:34:38,301 --> 00:34:42,014
or did you buy it to
match your fine clothes?

513
00:34:44,314 --> 00:34:46,311
Iron or gold?

514
00:34:49,332 --> 00:34:50,248
Gold.

515
00:34:55,138 --> 00:34:57,536
I'll not have my son dressed as a whore.

516
00:35:01,108 --> 00:35:02,589
My fears have come true.

517
00:35:03,324 --> 00:35:05,157
The Starks have made you theirs.

518
00:35:05,277 --> 00:35:06,885
My blood is salt and iron.

519
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:10,479
Yet, the Stark boy sends you
to me like a trained raven,

520
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:11,724
clutching his message.

521
00:35:11,772 --> 00:35:13,764
The offer he makes, is one I proposed.

522
00:35:13,806 --> 00:35:15,063
He heeds your counsel?

523
00:35:15,183 --> 00:35:17,715
I've lived with him, hunted
with him, fought at his side,

524
00:35:17,739 --> 00:35:19,027
he thinks of me as a brother.

525
00:35:19,051 --> 00:35:24,292
No, not here, not in my hearing,
you will not name him brother.

526
00:35:24,311 --> 00:35:28,137
This son of the man who put your
true brothers to the sword.

527
00:35:28,257 --> 00:35:30,619
Or have you forgotten your own blood?

528
00:35:31,017 --> 00:35:32,145
I forget nothing.

529
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:34,138
I remember my brothers.

530
00:35:35,726 --> 00:35:37,794
And I remember when my father was a king.

531
00:35:53,928 --> 00:35:54,963
I see.

532
00:35:55,771 --> 00:35:58,233
I destroy Robb Stark's enemies for him

533
00:35:58,353 --> 00:36:01,534
and he will make me King of
the Iron Islands once again.

534
00:36:01,654 --> 00:36:03,119
I will lead the attack myself.

535
00:36:03,177 --> 00:36:04,342
Oh, you will?

536
00:36:05,436 --> 00:36:07,454
I'm your son. Your only living heir.

537
00:36:08,028 --> 00:36:08,948
Who else?

538
00:36:12,092 --> 00:36:13,783
I told you to wait outside.

539
00:36:15,574 --> 00:36:17,025
How did you get past the guards?

540
00:36:17,101 --> 00:36:19,262
Anything with a cock is easy to fool.

541
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:21,836
My dear.

542
00:36:25,464 --> 00:36:29,063
- Yara?
- So good to see you, brother.

543
00:36:29,885 --> 00:36:32,911
This is a homecoming I'll
tell my grandchildren about.

544
00:36:35,899 --> 00:36:37,161
She can't lead an attack.

545
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,119
And why not?

546
00:36:39,168 --> 00:36:40,150
You're a woman.

547
00:36:40,202 --> 00:36:41,367
You're the one in skirts.

548
00:36:41,487 --> 00:36:42,984
This isn't Winterfell, boy.

549
00:36:43,624 --> 00:36:46,054
Your sister took over command
of your eldest brother's ship

550
00:36:46,174 --> 00:36:48,743
after your new father killed him.

551
00:36:48,863 --> 00:36:51,286
What's dead may never die.

552
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:56,075
The only night she's spent off these
islands has been spent on the sea.

553
00:36:57,030 --> 00:37:00,540
She's commanded men. She's killed men.

554
00:37:01,129 --> 00:37:03,185
She knows who she is.

555
00:37:05,888 --> 00:37:07,783
No man gives me a crown.

556
00:37:08,591 --> 00:37:10,559
I pay the iron price.

557
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:13,115
I will take my crown.

558
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,025
That is who I am.

559
00:37:16,464 --> 00:37:18,506
That is who we have always been.

560
00:37:23,286 --> 00:37:25,439
You won't stand a chance against
the Lannisters on your own.

561
00:37:25,457 --> 00:37:27,460
Who said anything about the Lannisters?

562
00:37:35,255 --> 00:37:38,131
You'll have your gold when we take
the treasury at King's Landing.

563
00:37:38,251 --> 00:37:42,305
All these kings fighting for the throne
and this Stannis has the smallest army.

564
00:37:42,973 --> 00:37:44,768
Why would I bet on the man
with the worst chance?

565
00:37:45,271 --> 00:37:46,870
Because you're a smart gambler.

566
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:49,916
Stannis has proved himself in war.
Twice.

567
00:37:50,799 --> 00:37:53,356
His baby brother has never
set foot on a battlefield.

568
00:37:53,983 --> 00:37:55,656
Neither has the false king, Joffrey.

569
00:37:55,704 --> 00:37:57,429
And yet, they both have larger armies.

570
00:37:57,453 --> 00:37:58,922
Stannis has just begun the fight.

571
00:37:59,686 --> 00:38:01,977
His bannermen will rally to his cause.

572
00:38:03,054 --> 00:38:07,108
There's no man in the Seven Kingdoms
more honorable than Stannis Baratheon.

573
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:08,424
Or more worthy of loyalty.

574
00:38:08,544 --> 00:38:12,643
What is the world coming to when smugglers
must vouch for the honor of kings.

575
00:38:12,658 --> 00:38:14,421
- Mind your words, pirate.
- Matthos.

576
00:38:15,032 --> 00:38:15,984
You think I'm insulted?

577
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:19,333
I am a pirate. I'm an excellent pirate.

578
00:38:19,744 --> 00:38:21,284
I don't sail for promises.

579
00:38:21,404 --> 00:38:22,250
Of course you do.

580
00:38:23,132 --> 00:38:25,200
Every time you leave harbor,
you're leaving on a promise.

581
00:38:26,034 --> 00:38:27,364
A promise that somewhere on the seas,

582
00:38:27,404 --> 00:38:29,444
somebody's got some gold and
you can take it from them.

583
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:30,855
That's a promise that always comes true.

584
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:31,682
As is mine.

585
00:38:32,577 --> 00:38:34,128
You're not the young man, Salladhor.

586
00:38:34,551 --> 00:38:38,030
And correct me if I'm wrong,
most pirates don't grow old.

587
00:38:38,819 --> 00:38:40,135
Only the clever ones.

588
00:38:40,765 --> 00:38:42,937
You want to spend your
last few years on the sea,

589
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:46,095
stealing from Pentoshi cheesemongers
and Midanese silk merchants,

590
00:38:46,108 --> 00:38:46,747
then go.

591
00:38:46,775 --> 00:38:47,555
They're out there waiting for you.

592
00:38:48,251 --> 00:38:49,060
That's easy.

593
00:38:50,122 --> 00:38:51,551
What I'm offering you is hard.

594
00:38:53,988 --> 00:38:56,601
Come with me and plunder the
greatest city in Westeros.

595
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,033
You'll be the richest man in Lysene.
And the most famous.

596
00:39:00,283 --> 00:39:03,573
They'll be singing songs about you
as long as men have voices to sing.

597
00:39:05,735 --> 00:39:07,587
Salladhor Saan is a good name for songs.

598
00:39:07,707 --> 00:39:08,419
It is.

599
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,784
- One thing, I want the queen.
- The queen?

600
00:39:11,904 --> 00:39:13,674
Cersei, I want her.

601
00:39:13,986 --> 00:39:16,289
I'll sail with your fleet,
all 30 of my ships,

602
00:39:16,553 --> 00:39:18,649
and if we don't drown at the
bottom of Blackwater Bay,

603
00:39:18,769 --> 00:39:21,766
I will fuck this blonde queen
and I will fuck her well.

604
00:39:21,886 --> 00:39:23,355
This war isn't about you.

605
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:26,945
We're not attacking King's Landing
so that you can rape the queen.

606
00:39:27,404 --> 00:39:29,825
I'm not going to rape her,
I'm going to fuck her.

607
00:39:30,365 --> 00:39:31,411
As if she would just let you.

608
00:39:31,531 --> 00:39:33,199
You don't know how persuasive I am.

609
00:39:34,056 --> 00:39:35,337
I never tried to fuck you.

610
00:39:37,676 --> 00:39:39,251
Stannis is the rightful king.

611
00:39:39,371 --> 00:39:40,778
And the Lord of Light.

612
00:39:40,898 --> 00:39:41,786
The one true god.

613
00:39:41,806 --> 00:39:43,398
I've been all over the world, my boy,

614
00:39:43,403 --> 00:39:46,086
and everywhere I go, people
tell me about the true god.

615
00:39:46,351 --> 00:39:47,969
They all think they found the right one.

616
00:39:48,506 --> 00:39:51,165
The one true god is what's
between a woman's legs,

617
00:39:51,442 --> 00:39:53,307
and better yet a queen's legs.

618
00:39:55,251 --> 00:39:57,182
I never thought you'd have
a true believer for a son.

619
00:39:57,405 --> 00:39:58,344
He's young yet.

620
00:39:59,778 --> 00:40:01,218
I promise you the gold.

621
00:40:01,656 --> 00:40:04,355
I promise you the glory.
I cannot promise you the queen.

622
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,005
You believe your king can win?

623
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:11,713
He is the one true king.

624
00:40:12,087 --> 00:40:13,582
You Westerosers are funny people.

625
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:16,956
A man chops off your fingers
and you fall in love with him.

626
00:40:18,758 --> 00:40:20,782
I'll sail with you, Davos Seaworth.

627
00:40:20,902 --> 00:40:23,582
You are the most honest
smuggler I ever met.

628
00:40:24,285 --> 00:40:25,652
Make me rich.

629
00:40:26,773 --> 00:40:29,400
Get me to the gates of
King's Landing and I will.

630
00:40:41,098 --> 00:40:42,685
When will the King have a sail?

631
00:40:43,104 --> 00:40:44,618
As soon as his God wills it.

632
00:40:44,738 --> 00:40:46,888
He's my God too, and yours...

633
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,132
but you were too blind to see.

634
00:40:51,732 --> 00:40:54,006
- Let me teach you how to read.
- Oh you and your mother.

635
00:40:54,126 --> 00:40:55,465
It won't take long you
already know the letters.

636
00:40:55,585 --> 00:40:57,854
The holy books are much more
persuasive than I can be.

637
00:40:57,974 --> 00:40:59,418
I wish I had a God, truly!

638
00:40:59,538 --> 00:41:00,950
I'm not mocking you, but I've seen men

639
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:04,566
pray to every God there is. Pray for wind,
pray for rain, pray for home,

640
00:41:04,686 --> 00:41:07,013
- None of it works!
- But you always came home.

641
00:41:07,133 --> 00:41:08,760
I wasn't praying, you know.

642
00:41:09,343 --> 00:41:10,893
But I was.

643
00:41:12,161 --> 00:41:13,820
Every night that you're at sea,

644
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:16,492
I lit a candle and I prayed for you.

645
00:41:18,006 --> 00:41:20,386
You want me to have a god, fine.

646
00:41:20,733 --> 00:41:22,173
King Stannis is my god.

647
00:41:22,511 --> 00:41:24,626
He raised me up and blessed
me with his trust.

648
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,158
He gave you a future

649
00:41:26,278 --> 00:41:27,690
I could never have imagined.

650
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:29,585
You know how to read,
you'll be a knight someday.

651
00:41:29,705 --> 00:41:32,437
You think your fire god commanded all that?

652
00:41:32,557 --> 00:41:33,855
It was Stannis.

653
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,952
Only Stannis.

654
00:41:36,253 --> 00:41:38,970
Stannis is my king, but he's only a man.

655
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:40,831
Don't tell him that.

656
00:41:43,256 --> 00:41:45,398
Lord Janos Slynt was
Commander of the City Watch.

657
00:41:45,518 --> 00:41:46,912
You had no right to exile him.

658
00:41:47,032 --> 00:41:48,705
I have every right. I am the King's Hand.

659
00:41:48,825 --> 00:41:51,143
You're serving as the King's
Hand until father gets here.

660
00:41:51,263 --> 00:41:53,793
- I am Queen Regent.
- Listen to me, Queen Regent,

661
00:41:53,913 --> 00:41:55,416
you're losing the people.

662
00:41:56,397 --> 00:41:58,476
- Do you hear me?
- The people?

663
00:41:58,859 --> 00:42:00,226
You think I care?

664
00:42:00,346 --> 00:42:03,627
You might find it difficult
to rule over millions who want you dead.

665
00:42:04,649 --> 00:42:08,523
Half the city will starve when winter comes.
The other half will plot to overthrow you.

666
00:42:08,902 --> 00:42:12,258
And gold-plated foes
just gave them the rallying cry.

667
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:14,902
The Queen slaughters babies.

668
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:19,799
You don't even have the decency to deny it.

669
00:42:29,712 --> 00:42:32,439
It wasn't you who gave the order, was it?

670
00:42:33,063 --> 00:42:34,959
Joffrey didn't even tell you.

671
00:42:37,093 --> 00:42:38,589
Did he tell you?

672
00:42:39,245 --> 00:42:40,923
I imagine that would be even worse.

673
00:42:41,043 --> 00:42:42,637
He did what needed to be done.

674
00:42:43,507 --> 00:42:45,001
You want to be the Hand of the King?

675
00:42:45,121 --> 00:42:46,168
You want to rule?

676
00:42:46,288 --> 00:42:47,559
This is what ruling is!

677
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:49,123
Lying on a bed of weeds,

678
00:42:49,243 --> 00:42:52,851
ripping them out by the root one by one
before they strangle you in your sleep.

679
00:42:52,971 --> 00:42:55,187
I'm no king, but I think there's
more to ruling that that.

680
00:42:55,307 --> 00:42:56,773
I don't care what you think!

681
00:42:57,353 --> 00:42:58,748
You've never taken it seriously.

682
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:00,663
You haven't, Jaime hasn't.

683
00:43:03,853 --> 00:43:06,218
It's all fallen on me.

684
00:43:10,101 --> 00:43:13,516
As has Jaime repeatedly,
according to Stannis Baratheon.

685
00:43:18,396 --> 00:43:20,712
You're funny.

686
00:43:22,994 --> 00:43:25,746
You've always been funny.

687
00:43:26,753 --> 00:43:30,277
But none of your jokes will ever match
the first one, will they?

688
00:43:31,485 --> 00:43:33,096
You remember...

689
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:38,365
Back when you ripped my mother open on
your way out of her and she bled to death.

690
00:43:40,268 --> 00:43:41,913
She was my mother too.

691
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:43,720
Now they're gone,

692
00:43:46,223 --> 00:43:47,727
for the sake of you.

693
00:43:50,828 --> 00:43:52,905
There's no bigger joke
in the world than that.

694
00:44:14,379 --> 00:44:17,279
Your Grace.
Your Grace.

695
00:44:17,399 --> 00:44:19,507
How did it fare with your pirate?

696
00:44:19,627 --> 00:44:21,655
Salladhor Saan will join our fleet.

697
00:44:21,775 --> 00:44:24,394
30 ships, his men know how to fight.

698
00:44:24,904 --> 00:44:27,938
In my experience, pirates
prefer fighting unarmed men.

699
00:44:28,529 --> 00:44:31,885
- Does seem the wiser choice.
- It won't be a choice this time.

700
00:44:33,099 --> 00:44:34,388
Do you trust him?

701
00:44:35,193 --> 00:44:38,039
Salladhor Saan is an old friend,
I've known him 30 years.

702
00:44:38,496 --> 00:44:40,160
I've never trusted him.

703
00:44:40,912 --> 00:44:43,436
Now once he gets the smell
of gold, he never stops.

704
00:44:44,563 --> 00:44:46,980
Well if he does his job,
he'll have his share.

705
00:44:51,195 --> 00:44:52,565
Leave us.

706
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,228
At once, Your Grace.

707
00:45:06,626 --> 00:45:09,293
The Lord of Light shines
through you, young warrior.

708
00:45:14,854 --> 00:45:16,268
Come.

709
00:45:23,335 --> 00:45:24,497
What did you say to him?

710
00:45:24,617 --> 00:45:28,167
I told him death by fire
is the purest death.

711
00:45:28,471 --> 00:45:31,006
- Why?
- Because it is true.

712
00:45:32,359 --> 00:45:34,055
You're troubled my king.

713
00:45:34,493 --> 00:45:35,441
Yeah.

714
00:45:35,715 --> 00:45:38,614
These armies are but toys
for the Lord of Light.

715
00:45:38,734 --> 00:45:40,329
Tell your lord to burn them then.

716
00:45:40,949 --> 00:45:42,708
I tell him nothing!

717
00:45:42,828 --> 00:45:45,822
I pray for his commands and I obey.

718
00:45:47,571 --> 00:45:50,607
My little brother has a hundred
thousand men according to the scouts.

719
00:45:51,337 --> 00:45:53,762
Men whose allegiance rightly belongs to me.

720
00:45:54,117 --> 00:45:56,926
- You must have faith.
- Faith?

721
00:45:58,858 --> 00:46:03,182
In a real war, the side with the greater
number wins nine times out of ten.

722
00:46:03,628 --> 00:46:05,069
Then we must be the ten.

723
00:46:05,189 --> 00:46:07,922
I cannot defeat my brother in the field,

724
00:46:09,254 --> 00:46:11,698
and I can't take King's Landing
without the men he stole.

725
00:46:14,233 --> 00:46:17,159
I have seen the path to
victory in the flames.

726
00:46:19,125 --> 00:46:22,215
At first, you must give
yourself to the Lord of Light.

727
00:46:22,335 --> 00:46:25,097
I've said the words, damn you.

728
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:30,053
I burnt the idols.

729
00:46:33,682 --> 00:46:36,782
You must give all of yourself.

730
00:46:41,675 --> 00:46:43,541
I have a wife.

731
00:46:45,019 --> 00:46:46,587
I took a vow.

732
00:46:48,101 --> 00:46:49,779
She's sick.

733
00:46:50,837 --> 00:46:52,387
Weak.

734
00:46:52,943 --> 00:46:55,205
Shut away in the tower.

735
00:46:56,554 --> 00:46:57,958
She disgusts you.

736
00:47:01,451 --> 00:47:03,520
And she's giving you nothing.

737
00:47:04,614 --> 00:47:05,763
No sons.

738
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:08,617
Only stillborns.

739
00:47:09,072 --> 00:47:10,586
Only death.

740
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:18,157
I will give you...

741
00:47:19,033 --> 00:47:20,656
a son, my King.

742
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:24,759
A son?

743
00:49:56,373 --> 00:50:16,062
