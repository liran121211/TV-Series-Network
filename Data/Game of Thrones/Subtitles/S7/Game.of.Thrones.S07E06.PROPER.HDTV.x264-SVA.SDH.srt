5
00:02:32,047 --> 00:02:34,379
- You all right?
- Mm.

6
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,588
Ever been north before?

7
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:38,254
Never seen snow before.

8
00:02:38,255 --> 00:02:40,129
Beautiful, eh?

9
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,671
I can breathe again.

10
00:02:41,672 --> 00:02:43,838
Down south, the air
smells like pig shit.

11
00:02:43,839 --> 00:02:45,463
You've never been down south.

12
00:02:45,464 --> 00:02:47,379
- I've been to Winterfell.
- That's the North.

00:02:48,797 --> 00:02:50,921
GENDRY: How do you live up here?

15
00:02:50,922 --> 00:02:52,796
How do you keep your
balls from freezing off?

16
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:55,296
TORMUND: You got to keep moving.
That's the secret.

17
00:02:55,297 --> 00:02:59,338
Walking's good, fighting's
better, fucking's best.

18
00:02:59,339 --> 00:03:02,796
There's not a living woman
within a hundred miles of here.

19
00:03:02,797 --> 00:03:05,172
We have to make do with what we've got.

20
00:03:10,797 --> 00:03:13,379
This one is maybe not so smart.

21
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,296
Davos says he's a strong fighter.

22
00:03:15,297 --> 00:03:18,796
Good. That's more important
than being smart.

23
00:03:18,797 --> 00:03:22,005
Smart people don't come up
here looking for the dead.

24
00:03:23,547 --> 00:03:26,838
TORMUND: So, you met
this Dragon Queen, huh?

25
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,212
And?

26
00:03:28,213 --> 00:03:31,588
She'll only fight beside
us if I bend the knee.

27
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:34,004
You spent too much time
with the Free Folk.

28
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,714
Now you don't like kneeling.

29
00:03:38,672 --> 00:03:41,004
Mance Rayder was a brave man.

30
00:03:41,005 --> 00:03:42,838
A proud man.

31
00:03:42,839 --> 00:03:46,672
The King-beyond-the-Wall
never bent the knee.

32
00:03:48,005 --> 00:03:51,672
How many of his people
died for his pride?

33
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,004
You still mad at us, boy?

34
00:04:07,005 --> 00:04:09,046
You sold me to a witch.

35
00:04:09,047 --> 00:04:10,463
A priestess.

36
00:04:10,464 --> 00:04:13,379
I'll admit, it is a subtle distinction.

37
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,546
We're fighting a great war.
Wars cost money.

38
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:18,421
I wanted to be one of you.

39
00:04:18,422 --> 00:04:21,463
I wanted to join the
Brotherhood, but you sold me off

40
00:04:21,464 --> 00:04:23,421
like a slave.

41
00:04:23,422 --> 00:04:25,421
Do you know what she did to me?

42
00:04:25,422 --> 00:04:27,004
She strapped me down on a bed,

43
00:04:27,005 --> 00:04:29,838
- she stripped me naked...
- Sounds all right so far.

44
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:32,588
- And put leeches on me.
- Was she naked, too?

45
00:04:32,589 --> 00:04:34,046
She needed your blood.

46
00:04:34,047 --> 00:04:35,713
Yes, thank you. I know that.

47
00:04:35,714 --> 00:04:38,671
- Could have been worse.
- She wanted to kill me!

48
00:04:38,672 --> 00:04:40,707
They would have killed
me if wasn't for Davos.

49
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:42,672
But they didn't, did they?

50
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:44,588
So, what you whinging about?

51
00:04:44,589 --> 00:04:46,254
I'm not whinging.

52
00:04:46,255 --> 00:04:49,212
Your lips are moving and you're
complaining about something.

53
00:04:49,213 --> 00:04:51,254
That's whinging.

54
00:04:51,255 --> 00:04:53,046
This one's been killed six times.

55
00:04:53,047 --> 00:04:54,756
You don't hear him bitching about it.

56
00:05:04,963 --> 00:05:06,380
Good lad.

57
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:14,588
JON: The first time I went north
of the Wall was with your father.

58
00:05:14,589 --> 00:05:16,212
He was a good man.

59
00:05:16,213 --> 00:05:19,338
He deserved a better son.

60
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:21,379
Were you with him at the end?

61
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:24,463
I was a prisoner of the wildlings.

62
00:05:24,464 --> 00:05:26,463
But we avenged him.

63
00:05:26,464 --> 00:05:27,962
I want you to know that.

64
00:05:27,963 --> 00:05:30,962
Every mutineer found justice.

65
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:33,796
Can't think of a worse
way for him to go.

66
00:05:33,797 --> 00:05:35,296
The Night's Watch was his life.

67
00:05:35,297 --> 00:05:38,129
He would have died to protect
every one of those men.

68
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,588
And they butchered him.

69
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,796
I hate that he died that way.

70
00:05:42,797 --> 00:05:45,463
My father was the most
honorable man I ever met.

71
00:05:45,464 --> 00:05:48,254
He was good all the way through.

72
00:05:48,255 --> 00:05:51,504
And he died on the executioner's block.

73
00:05:51,505 --> 00:05:55,671
Your father wanted to
execute me, you know?

74
00:05:55,672 --> 00:05:57,212
I heard.

75
00:05:57,213 --> 00:05:59,504
He was in the right, of course.

76
00:05:59,505 --> 00:06:02,004
Didn't make me hate him any less.

77
00:06:02,005 --> 00:06:05,005
- I'm glad he didn't catch you.
- Me, too.

78
00:06:13,505 --> 00:06:15,254
Your father gave me this sword.

79
00:06:15,255 --> 00:06:18,797
Changed the pommel from
a bear to a wolf...

80
00:06:22,464 --> 00:06:24,047
but it's still Longclaw.

81
00:06:30,464 --> 00:06:32,338
Lord Commander Mormont

82
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:34,963
thought you'd never
come back to Westeros.

83
00:06:36,464 --> 00:06:38,838
But you are back,

84
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:42,796
and it's been in your
family for centuries.

85
00:06:42,797 --> 00:06:44,589
It's not right for me to have it.

86
00:06:48,213 --> 00:06:50,171
He gave it to you.

87
00:06:50,172 --> 00:06:52,380
I'm not his son.

88
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,547
I brought shame onto my house.

89
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,255
I broke my father's heart.

90
00:07:07,047 --> 00:07:09,547
I forfeited the right
to claim this sword.

91
00:07:11,714 --> 00:07:13,379
It's yours.

92
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,505
May it serve you well...

93
00:07:16,881 --> 00:07:18,547
and your children after you.

95
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:34,963
(CHATTER)

96
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:47,254
Father used to watch us from up here.

97
00:07:47,255 --> 00:07:49,755
He wouldn't say much.

98
00:07:49,756 --> 00:07:51,129
You probably don't remember.

99
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:53,130
You were inside knitting all the time.

100
00:07:54,464 --> 00:07:55,881
I remember.

101
00:07:58,005 --> 00:08:00,963
One time, the boys were shooting
arrows with Ser Rodrik.

102
00:08:02,297 --> 00:08:04,588
I came out here after,

103
00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:06,838
and Bran had left his bow behind,

104
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:09,463
just lying on the ground.

105
00:08:09,464 --> 00:08:11,839
Ser Rodrik would have
cuffed him if he saw.

106
00:08:14,339 --> 00:08:17,421
There was one arrow in the target.

107
00:08:17,422 --> 00:08:21,087
There was no one around, just like now.

108
00:08:21,088 --> 00:08:22,963
No one to stop me.

109
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:26,588
So I started shooting.

110
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,962
And every shot, I had to go up there

111
00:08:28,963 --> 00:08:32,255
and get my one arrow and walk
back and shoot it again.

112
00:08:33,756 --> 00:08:35,505
I wasn't very good.

113
00:08:37,047 --> 00:08:40,046
Finally, I hit the bull's-eye.

114
00:08:40,047 --> 00:08:42,463
Could have been the
20th shot or the 50th.

115
00:08:42,464 --> 00:08:43,921
I don't remember.

116
00:08:43,922 --> 00:08:47,339
But I hit the bull's-eye,
and I heard this.

117
00:08:49,756 --> 00:08:51,254
I looked up,

118
00:08:51,255 --> 00:08:53,004
and he's standing right here,

119
00:08:53,005 --> 00:08:54,672
smiling down at me.

120
00:08:57,172 --> 00:09:00,254
I knew what I was doing
was against the rules.

121
00:09:00,255 --> 00:09:04,671
But he was smiling, so I
knew it wasn't wrong.

122
00:09:04,672 --> 00:09:06,213
The rules were wrong.

123
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,881
I was doing what I was meant
to be doing, and he knew it.

124
00:09:13,756 --> 00:09:15,505
Now he's dead.

125
00:09:17,005 --> 00:09:19,254
Killed by the Lannisters

126
00:09:19,255 --> 00:09:20,881
with your help.

127
00:09:24,547 --> 00:09:25,947
What?

128
00:09:35,547 --> 00:09:37,755
That's your pretty handwriting.

129
00:09:37,756 --> 00:09:39,588
Septa Mordane used to crack my knuckles

130
00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:41,339
'cause I couldn't write as well as you.

131
00:09:43,422 --> 00:09:47,379
"Robb, I write to you
today with heavy heart.

132
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,546
Our good King Robert is dead,

133
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,379
killed from wounds he
took in a boar hunt."

134
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,880
You don't have to read it. I remember.

135
00:09:52,881 --> 00:09:54,588
"Father has been charged with treason.

136
00:09:54,589 --> 00:09:57,546
He conspired with Robert's brothers
against my beloved Joffrey

137
00:09:57,547 --> 00:09:59,379
and tried to steal his throne.

138
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,212
The Lannisters are treating me well

139
00:10:01,213 --> 00:10:03,212
and providing me with every comfort.

140
00:10:03,213 --> 00:10:05,546
I beg you, come to King's Landing,

141
00:10:05,547 --> 00:10:07,421
swear fealty to King Joffrey,

142
00:10:07,422 --> 00:10:09,630
and prevent any strife
between the great houses

143
00:10:09,631 --> 00:10:11,421
of Lannister and Stark.

144
00:10:11,422 --> 00:10:13,630
Your faithful sister, Sansa."

145
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,046
They forced me to do it.

146
00:10:16,047 --> 00:10:17,212
Did they?

147
00:10:17,213 --> 00:10:19,504
With a knife at your throat?

148
00:10:19,505 --> 00:10:20,962
Did they put you on a
rack and stretch you

149
00:10:20,963 --> 00:10:22,671
until your bones started to pop?

150
00:10:22,672 --> 00:10:24,588
You don't know what it was like.
I was a child.

151
00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:28,421
So was I. I would have let them kill
me before I betrayed my family.

152
00:10:28,422 --> 00:10:31,254
They told me it was the
only way to save Father.

153
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:33,797
And you were stupid
enough to believe them.

154
00:10:35,547 --> 00:10:38,755
I remember you standing on that
platform with Joffrey and Cersei

155
00:10:38,756 --> 00:10:40,463
when they dragged Father to the block.

156
00:10:40,464 --> 00:10:42,087
I remember the pretty
dress you were wearing.

157
00:10:42,088 --> 00:10:44,464
I remember the fancy
way you did your hair.

158
00:10:46,297 --> 00:10:47,421
You were there?

159
00:10:47,422 --> 00:10:48,713
I was there.

160
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:51,588
Standing in the crowd
near Baelor's statue.

161
00:10:51,589 --> 00:10:53,379
And what did you do?

162
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,796
Did you come running to the rescue?

163
00:10:55,797 --> 00:10:58,588
Did you fight off the
Lannisters and save Father?

164
00:10:58,589 --> 00:11:01,212
- I wanted to.
- But you didn't, just like me.

165
00:11:01,213 --> 00:11:03,796
I didn't betray him. I
didn't betray Robb.

166
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:07,464
I didn't betray our entire
family for my beloved Joffrey.

167
00:11:09,797 --> 00:11:12,796
You should be on your
knees, thanking me.

168
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:16,671
We're standing in Winterfell
again because of me.

169
00:11:16,672 --> 00:11:18,880
You didn't win it back,
Jon didn't win it back.

170
00:11:18,881 --> 00:11:20,962
He lost the Battle of the Bastards.

171
00:11:20,963 --> 00:11:22,713
The Knights of the Vale won the battle,

172
00:11:22,714 --> 00:11:24,338
and they rode north for me.

173
00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:27,630
While you were off, where?
Traveling the world?

174
00:11:27,631 --> 00:11:30,463
- I was training.
- Training.

175
00:11:30,464 --> 00:11:32,338
Well, while you were training,

176
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:35,588
I suffered things you
could never imagine.

177
00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:38,213
Oh, I don't know about that.
I can imagine quite a lot.

178
00:11:40,047 --> 00:11:42,962
You never would have
survived what I survived.

179
00:11:42,963 --> 00:11:45,547
I guess we'll never know.

180
00:11:49,672 --> 00:11:51,505
What are you going to
do with that letter?

181
00:11:53,005 --> 00:11:54,464
I don't know yet.

182
00:11:56,005 --> 00:11:58,796
Who did you show it to?
Where did you find it?

183
00:11:58,797 --> 00:12:00,880
You're scared, aren't you?

184
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:03,004
What are you scared of?

185
00:12:03,005 --> 00:12:05,004
You didn't commit any crimes.

186
00:12:05,005 --> 00:12:06,838
- No one's going to hang you.
- Well, Arya...

187
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:09,296
You're scared I'll show it
to Jon and he'll be angry.

188
00:12:09,297 --> 00:12:12,671
No, that's not Jon. He'll understand.

189
00:12:12,672 --> 00:12:14,630
You were just a scared little girl,

190
00:12:14,631 --> 00:12:16,838
all alone with the wicked Lannisters.

191
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:20,713
Do you know how happy Cersei would
be right now if she saw us fighting?

192
00:12:20,714 --> 00:12:22,713
This is exactly what she wants.

193
00:12:22,714 --> 00:12:24,796
This is what she's always
wanted... to tear us apart.

194
00:12:24,797 --> 00:12:27,380
You're scared the Northern
lords will read it.

195
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:30,588
They wouldn't think much of Lady Sansa

196
00:12:30,589 --> 00:12:33,588
if they knew how she
did Cersei's bidding.

197
00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:36,588
What would little Lyanna Mormont say?

198
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,755
She's younger than you
were when you wrote this.

199
00:12:39,756 --> 00:12:42,255
Are you going to say,
"But I was just a child?"

200
00:12:44,963 --> 00:12:46,838
You're angry.

201
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:50,046
Sometimes anger makes people
do unfortunate things.

202
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,672
Sometimes fear makes them
do unfortunate things.

203
00:12:54,672 --> 00:12:56,547
I'll go with anger.

204
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,463
You're the one they call "the Dog."

205
00:13:29,464 --> 00:13:31,296
- Fuck off.
- (CHUCKLES)

206
00:13:31,297 --> 00:13:33,087
They told me you were mean.

207
00:13:33,088 --> 00:13:35,504
Were you born mean or
you just hate wildings?

208
00:13:35,505 --> 00:13:37,880
I don't give two shits about wildings.

209
00:13:37,881 --> 00:13:39,588
It's gingers I hate.

210
00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:41,463
Gingers are beautiful.

211
00:13:41,464 --> 00:13:45,046
We are kissed by fire, just like you.

212
00:13:45,047 --> 00:13:47,963
Don't point your fucking finger at me.

213
00:13:52,213 --> 00:13:55,338
Did you trip into the fire
when you were a baby?

214
00:13:55,339 --> 00:13:57,087
I didn't trip, I was pushed.

215
00:13:57,088 --> 00:13:59,004
And ever since, you've been mean.

216
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,630
Will you fuck off?

217
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,588
I don't think you're truly mean.

218
00:14:02,589 --> 00:14:04,130
You have sad eyes.

219
00:14:05,422 --> 00:14:07,129
You want to suck my dick, is that it?

220
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,838
- Dick?
- Cock.

221
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,838
Ah, dick.

222
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,129
I like it.

223
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:15,171
I bet you do.

224
00:14:15,172 --> 00:14:17,796
Nope, it's pussy for me.

225
00:14:17,797 --> 00:14:20,796
I have a beauty waiting for
me back at Winterfell.

226
00:14:20,797 --> 00:14:22,921
If I ever get back there.

227
00:14:22,922 --> 00:14:25,671
Yellow hair, blue eyes,

228
00:14:25,672 --> 00:14:27,880
the tallest woman you've ever seen.

229
00:14:27,881 --> 00:14:29,339
Almost as tall as you.

230
00:14:31,505 --> 00:14:33,671
- Brienne of Tarth.
- You know her?

231
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:36,004
You're with Brienne of fucking Tarth?

232
00:14:36,005 --> 00:14:38,379
Well, not with her yet.

233
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:42,004
- But I see the way she looks at me.
- How does she look at you?

234
00:14:42,005 --> 00:14:44,463
Like she wants to carve you
up and eat your liver?

235
00:14:44,464 --> 00:14:46,212
You do know her.

236
00:14:46,213 --> 00:14:47,671
We've met.

237
00:14:47,672 --> 00:14:49,796
I want to make babies with her.

238
00:14:49,797 --> 00:14:52,796
Think of them... great big monsters.

239
00:14:52,797 --> 00:14:54,379
They'd conquer the world.

240
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:57,962
How did a mad fucker
like you live this long?

241
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:59,714
I'm good at killing people.

242
00:15:02,631 --> 00:15:04,254
You don't look much like him.

243
00:15:04,255 --> 00:15:05,713
Who's that?

244
00:15:05,714 --> 00:15:07,755
Your father.

245
00:15:07,756 --> 00:15:09,838
I suppose you favor your mother.

246
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,212
You knew him?

247
00:15:12,213 --> 00:15:14,004
'Course I did.

248
00:15:14,005 --> 00:15:15,588
When he was Hand,

249
00:15:15,589 --> 00:15:17,962
he sent me off hunting for the Mountain.

250
00:15:17,963 --> 00:15:19,421
Your wildling friend told me

251
00:15:19,422 --> 00:15:21,713
the red woman brought you back.

252
00:15:21,714 --> 00:15:25,880
Thoros has brought me back six times.

253
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:28,962
We both serve the same lord.

254
00:15:28,963 --> 00:15:30,880
I serve the North.

255
00:15:30,881 --> 00:15:32,921
The North didn't raise
you from the dead.

256
00:15:32,922 --> 00:15:34,921
The Lord of Light never spoke to me.

257
00:15:34,922 --> 00:15:36,296
I don't know anything about him.

258
00:15:36,297 --> 00:15:37,921
I don't know what he wants from me.

259
00:15:37,922 --> 00:15:41,296
- He wants you alive.
- Why?

260
00:15:41,297 --> 00:15:43,713
I don't know.

261
00:15:43,714 --> 00:15:47,087
That's all anyone can
tell me... "I don't know."

262
00:15:47,088 --> 00:15:48,921
So, what's the point in serving a god

263
00:15:48,922 --> 00:15:51,421
if none of us knows what he wants?

264
00:15:51,422 --> 00:15:54,129
I think about that all the time.

265
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:57,212
I don't think it's our
purpose to understand.

266
00:15:57,213 --> 00:16:00,588
Except one thing... we're soldiers.

267
00:16:00,589 --> 00:16:03,254
We have to know what we're fighting for.

268
00:16:03,255 --> 00:16:06,463
I'm not fighting so some
man or woman I barely know

269
00:16:06,464 --> 00:16:09,504
can sit on a throne made of swords.

270
00:16:09,505 --> 00:16:11,921
So, what are you fighting for?

271
00:16:11,922 --> 00:16:13,322
Life.

272
00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:16,421
Death is the enemy.

273
00:16:16,422 --> 00:16:19,714
The first enemy and the last.

274
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:22,947
But we all die.

275
00:16:24,631 --> 00:16:26,962
The enemy always wins.

276
00:16:26,963 --> 00:16:29,212
And we still need to fight him.

277
00:16:29,213 --> 00:16:31,171
That's all I know.

278
00:16:31,172 --> 00:16:34,630
You and I won't find much
joy while we're here,

279
00:16:34,631 --> 00:16:36,880
but we can keep others alive.

280
00:16:36,881 --> 00:16:39,672
We can defend those who
can't defend themselves.

281
00:16:42,963 --> 00:16:45,880
"I am the shield that
guards the realms of men."

282
00:16:45,881 --> 00:16:49,713
Maybe we don't need to
understand any more than that.

283
00:16:49,714 --> 00:16:51,921
Maybe that's enough.

284
00:16:51,922 --> 00:16:53,322
Aye.

285
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:56,631
Maybe that's enough.

286
00:17:04,422 --> 00:17:07,005
That's what I saw in the fire.

287
00:17:08,172 --> 00:17:10,213
A mountain like an arrowhead.

288
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:13,547
THOROS: Are you sure?

289
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:18,005
We're getting close.

290
00:17:26,005 --> 00:17:28,005
DAENERYS: Do you know
what I like about you?

291
00:17:30,297 --> 00:17:33,504
- I honestly don't.
- You're not a hero.

292
00:17:33,505 --> 00:17:35,046
Oh.

293
00:17:35,047 --> 00:17:37,838
Well, I've been heroic on occasion.

294
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:40,630
I once charged through the Mud
Gate of King's Landing and...

295
00:17:40,631 --> 00:17:42,421
I don't want you to be a hero.

296
00:17:42,422 --> 00:17:45,713
Heroes do stupid things and they die.

297
00:17:45,714 --> 00:17:47,755
Drogo, Jorah, Daario,

298
00:17:47,756 --> 00:17:51,046
even this... Jon Snow...

299
00:17:51,047 --> 00:17:53,713
they all try to outdo each other.

300
00:17:53,714 --> 00:17:55,880
Who can do the stupidest, bravest thing.

301
00:17:55,881 --> 00:17:58,880
It's interesting, these heroes you name.

302
00:17:58,881 --> 00:18:01,087
Drogo, Jorah, Daario,

303
00:18:01,088 --> 00:18:04,004
even this... Jon Snow.

304
00:18:04,005 --> 00:18:06,129
They all fell in love with you.

305
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:09,087
- Jon Snow's not in love with me.
- Oh, my mistake.

306
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,796
I suppose he stares at you longingly

307
00:18:10,797 --> 00:18:13,714
because he's hopeful for a
successful military alliance.

308
00:18:17,213 --> 00:18:19,671
He's too little for me.

309
00:18:19,672 --> 00:18:21,504
I didn't mean...

310
00:18:21,505 --> 00:18:24,671
As heroes go, he is quite little.

311
00:18:24,672 --> 00:18:27,087
I know you're brave.

312
00:18:27,088 --> 00:18:29,047
I wouldn't have chosen
a coward as my Hand.

313
00:18:34,088 --> 00:18:36,962
So, if all goes well,

314
00:18:36,963 --> 00:18:39,255
I'll finally get to meet your sister.

315
00:18:40,797 --> 00:18:42,588
From everything you've
told me about her,

316
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:44,921
she'd rather murder me
than speak with me.

317
00:18:44,922 --> 00:18:48,755
Oh, first, she'd torture
you in some horrible way,

318
00:18:48,756 --> 00:18:50,156
then she'd murder you.

319
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:54,796
Nobody trusts my sister
less than I do, believe me.

320
00:18:54,797 --> 00:18:56,588
But if we go to the capital,

321
00:18:56,589 --> 00:18:59,421
we'll go with two armies,
we'll go with three dragons.

322
00:18:59,422 --> 00:19:03,171
Anyone touches you, King's Landing
burns down to the foundation stones.

323
00:19:03,172 --> 00:19:05,212
And right now, she's thinking
of how to set a trap.

324
00:19:05,213 --> 00:19:06,796
Of course she is.

325
00:19:06,797 --> 00:19:09,087
And she's wondering what
trap you're laying for her.

326
00:19:09,088 --> 00:19:10,546
Are we?

327
00:19:10,547 --> 00:19:12,714
Laying any traps?

328
00:19:14,714 --> 00:19:18,046
If we want to create a
new and better world,

329
00:19:18,047 --> 00:19:21,171
I'm not sure deceit and mass
murder is the best way to start.

330
00:19:21,172 --> 00:19:23,963
Which war was won without
deceit and mass murder?

331
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,755
Yes, you'll need to be ruthless

332
00:19:27,756 --> 00:19:29,630
if you're going to win the throne.

333
00:19:29,631 --> 00:19:31,671
You need to inspire a degree of fear.

334
00:19:31,672 --> 00:19:34,046
But fear is all Cersei has.

335
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:36,880
It's all my father had, and Joffrey.

336
00:19:36,881 --> 00:19:38,796
It makes their power brittle

337
00:19:38,797 --> 00:19:42,588
because everyone beneath
them longs to see them dead.

338
00:19:42,589 --> 00:19:45,129
Aegon Targaryen got quite
a long way on fear.

339
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:46,796
He did.

340
00:19:46,797 --> 00:19:49,421
But you once spoke to me
of breaking the wheel.

341
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:50,880
Aegon built a wheel.

342
00:19:50,881 --> 00:19:53,087
If that's the kind of
queen you want to be,

343
00:19:53,088 --> 00:19:55,671
how are you different from all the
other tyrants that came before you?

344
00:19:55,672 --> 00:19:59,087
So we walk into the lions' den.

345
00:19:59,088 --> 00:20:00,755
My brother promised me he'd keep a grip

346
00:20:00,756 --> 00:20:02,379
on the Lannister forces.

347
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:06,254
Forgive me, but I don't care
about any Lannister promises.

348
00:20:06,255 --> 00:20:07,546
Except yours.

349
00:20:07,547 --> 00:20:09,671
And I promised him

350
00:20:09,672 --> 00:20:12,213
I'd keep you from doing
anything impulsive.

351
00:20:13,631 --> 00:20:15,031
Impulsive?

352
00:20:18,547 --> 00:20:21,254
This will be a difficult negotiation.

353
00:20:21,255 --> 00:20:24,796
We're sitting down with people who
want to see us both headless.

354
00:20:24,797 --> 00:20:27,296
My sister is likely to say
something provocative.

355
00:20:27,297 --> 00:20:29,838
- And?
- And you have been known

356
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:32,004
to lose your temper from time to time,

357
00:20:32,005 --> 00:20:33,338
as all great leaders do.

358
00:20:33,339 --> 00:20:35,755
When have I lost my temper?

359
00:20:35,756 --> 00:20:38,296
Burning the Tarlys, for instance.

360
00:20:38,297 --> 00:20:39,838
That was not impulsive.

361
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:42,671
That was necessary.

362
00:20:42,672 --> 00:20:44,588
- Perhaps.
- Perhaps?

363
00:20:44,589 --> 00:20:48,171
Perhaps the father needed
to die and not the son.

364
00:20:48,172 --> 00:20:50,880
Perhaps they both needed time
to contemplate their mistakes

365
00:20:50,881 --> 00:20:53,171
in the solitude of a cold cell.

366
00:20:53,172 --> 00:20:55,588
We had no time to discuss
the possibilities

367
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:57,630
before you ended their possibilities.

368
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,338
One could be forgiven for
thinking you're taking

369
00:20:59,339 --> 00:21:01,171
your family's side in this debate.

370
00:21:01,172 --> 00:21:03,004
I am taking their side.

371
00:21:03,005 --> 00:21:04,713
You need to take your enemy's side

372
00:21:04,714 --> 00:21:06,713
if you're going to see
things the way they do.

373
00:21:06,714 --> 00:21:08,671
And you need to see
things the way they do

374
00:21:08,672 --> 00:21:10,713
if you're going to
anticipate their actions,

375
00:21:10,714 --> 00:21:14,046
respond effectively, and beat them.

376
00:21:14,047 --> 00:21:16,379
Which I want you to do very much.

377
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,880
Because I believe in you and in
the world you want to build.

378
00:21:19,881 --> 00:21:22,546
But the world you want to build

379
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:24,129
doesn't get built all at once.

380
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:27,254
Probably not in a single lifetime.

381
00:21:27,255 --> 00:21:30,087
How do we ensure that
your vision endures?

382
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:33,047
After you break the wheel, how
do we make sure it stays broken?

383
00:21:35,589 --> 00:21:38,921
You want to know who sits on the
Iron Throne after I'm dead.

384
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:40,322
Is that it?

385
00:21:41,756 --> 00:21:43,671
You say you can't have children,

386
00:21:43,672 --> 00:21:46,962
but there are other ways
of choosing a successor.

387
00:21:46,963 --> 00:21:49,087
The Night's Watch has one method.

388
00:21:49,088 --> 00:21:51,463
The ironborn, for all their
many flaws, have another.

389
00:21:51,464 --> 00:21:54,171
We will discuss the succession
after I wear the crown.

390
00:21:54,172 --> 00:21:55,921
Your Grace, I saw hundreds of arrows

391
00:21:55,922 --> 00:21:58,254
fly towards you when you
fought on the Blackwater Rush,

392
00:21:58,255 --> 00:22:00,338
and I saw hundreds of arrows miss.

393
00:22:00,339 --> 00:22:02,962
But any one of them could have
found your heart and ended your...

394
00:22:02,963 --> 00:22:06,129
You've been thinking about my
death quite a bit, haven't you?

395
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,713
Is this one of the items you discussed

396
00:22:07,714 --> 00:22:09,421
with your brother in King's Landing?

397
00:22:09,422 --> 00:22:11,880
I'm trying to serve you by
planning for the long term.

398
00:22:11,881 --> 00:22:13,463
Perhaps if you planned
for the short term,

399
00:22:13,464 --> 00:22:15,505
we wouldn't have lost
Dorne and Highgarden.

400
00:22:18,589 --> 00:22:22,797

after I wear the crown.

heard from him in weeks.

You're the Lady of Winterfell.

rule in his absence.

when it was time to retake Winterfell,

450
00:27:41,547 --> 00:27:43,212
then they named him their king,

451
00:27:43,213 --> 00:27:45,087
and now they're ready to turn
their backs on him again.

You may have disagreements,

461
00:28:06,963 --> 00:28:09,421
but she would never betray her family.

462
00:28:09,422 --> 00:28:11,962
She would if she thought I
was going to betray Jon.

charging through the breach.

lead Your servant into the light.

534

We have to burn his body.

535

We'll all be close behind him

enough to send us a bit of fire.

544

546

No. There's another.

553
00:39:52,797 --> 00:39:54,197

No one else. Just us.

559

us freeze to death?

me here to find it.

you with Littlefinger.

to them all behind your back?

behind to watch over you.

I swore an oath to protect you and
your sister. If I abandon you...

598
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,970
The trip to King's Landing
is long, Lady Brienne,

599
00:42:25,005 --> 00:42:27,546
and you won't be traveling
on summer roads.

You want to do the asking?

715
01:01:48,464 --> 01:01:50,504
Are you sure?

716
01:01:50,505 --> 01:01:52,338
The Game of Faces
didn't turn out so well

717
01:01:52,339 --> 01:01:54,087
for the last person who
asked me questions.

718
01:01:54,088 --> 01:01:56,047
Tell me what they are.

719
01:01:59,172 --> 01:02:02,339
We both wanted to be other
people when we were younger.

720
01:02:03,505 --> 01:02:05,880
You wanted to be a queen,

721
01:02:05,881 --> 01:02:09,172
to sit next to a handsome,
young king on the Iron Throne.

722
01:02:10,672 --> 01:02:12,962
I wanted to be a knight,

723
01:02:12,963 --> 01:02:16,047
to pick up a sword like
Father and go off to battle.

724
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:22,212
Neither of us got to be
that other person, did we?

725
01:02:22,213 --> 01:02:25,839
The world doesn't just let girls
decide what they're going to be.

726
01:02:27,213 --> 01:02:28,838
But I can now.

727
01:02:28,839 --> 01:02:31,962
With the faces, I can choose.

728
01:02:31,963 --> 01:02:34,255
I can become someone else.

729
01:02:35,714 --> 01:02:38,046
Speak in their voice,

730
01:02:38,047 --> 01:02:39,672
live in their skin.

731
01:02:42,255 --> 01:02:44,881
I could even become you.

732
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:55,087
I wonder what it would feel like

733
01:02:55,088 --> 01:02:57,255
to wear those pretty dresses...

734
01:02:59,047 --> 01:03:01,464
to be the Lady of Winterfell.

735
01:03:03,922 --> 01:03:06,255
All I'd need to find out...

736
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:09,780
is your face.

737
01:03:15,756 --> 01:03:17,213
(GASPS)

738
01:04:08,339 --> 01:04:09,963
I'm sorry.

739
01:04:12,297 --> 01:04:14,088
I'm so sorry.

740
01:04:25,672 --> 01:04:27,963
I wish I could take it back.

741
01:04:30,005 --> 01:04:32,005
I wish we'd never gone.

742
01:04:35,505 --> 01:04:37,005
I don't.

743
01:04:38,672 --> 01:04:41,005
If we hadn't gone, I wouldn't have seen.

744
01:04:43,005 --> 01:04:44,963
You have to see it to know.

745
01:04:46,756 --> 01:04:48,339
Now I know.

746
01:04:51,714 --> 01:04:54,671
The dragons are my children.

747
01:04:54,672 --> 01:04:57,338
They're the only
children I'll ever have.

748
01:04:57,339 --> 01:04:58,963
Do you understand?

749
01:05:04,756 --> 01:05:09,171
We are going to destroy the
Night King and his army.

750
01:05:09,172 --> 01:05:11,047
And we'll do it together.

751
01:05:12,963 --> 01:05:15,005
You have my word.

752
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:19,839
Thank you, Dany.

753
01:05:21,672 --> 01:05:23,046
"Dany"?

754
01:05:23,047 --> 01:05:24,546
(CHUCKLES)

755
01:05:24,547 --> 01:05:26,714
Who was the last person
who called me that?

756
01:05:28,547 --> 01:05:31,379
I'm not sure. Was it my brother?

757
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:34,213
Mm, not the company you want to keep.

758
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:36,922
All right.

759
01:05:38,714 --> 01:05:40,114
Not "Dany."

760
01:05:44,213 --> 01:05:46,213
How about "my queen"?

761
01:05:49,672 --> 01:05:53,046
I'd, uh, bend the knee, but...

762
01:05:53,047 --> 01:05:56,212
What about those who
swore allegiance to you?

763
01:05:56,213 --> 01:05:59,422
They'll all come to see
you for what you are.

764
01:06:15,255 --> 01:06:16,922
I hope I deserve it.

765
01:06:18,922 --> 01:06:20,756
You do.

766
01:06:41,297 --> 01:06:42,963
You should get some rest.

767
01:06:50,005 --> 01:06:51,505
(SIGHS)

768
01:07:12,756 --> 01:07:15,130
