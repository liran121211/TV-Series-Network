2
00:02:08,085 --> 00:02:10,085
Hold that wagon!

3
00:02:24,252 --> 00:02:26,501
You've just won the biggest
prize in the world.

4
00:02:26,502 --> 00:02:28,752
What could you possibly
have to be upset about?

5
00:02:30,835 --> 00:02:32,959
Come on, you can tell me.

6
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,501
Queen of Thorns give you one
last prick in the balls

7
00:02:35,502 --> 00:02:36,834
before saying goodbye?

8
00:02:36,835 --> 00:02:39,418
I'll save my confessions
for the High Septon.

9
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:41,626
There is no more High Septon.

10
00:02:41,627 --> 00:02:43,876
No, there isn't, is there?

11
00:02:43,877 --> 00:02:47,169
There is still
the question of my prize.

12
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,834
That's a lot of money
I just gave you.

13
00:02:51,835 --> 00:02:53,169
It's not a castle.

14
00:02:54,835 --> 00:02:57,001
How about that one?
It's available.

15
00:02:57,002 --> 00:02:58,376
You don't want Highgarden.

16
00:02:58,377 --> 00:03:01,168
- I beg to differ.
- We're at war.

17
00:03:01,169 --> 00:03:04,377
Daenerys Targaryen could come and take
it back the day after you move in.

18
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:07,626
Besides, think of the upkeep.

19
00:03:07,627 --> 00:03:10,667
The more you owe,
the more it weighs you down.

20
00:03:10,668 --> 00:03:13,251
Oh, is that why
you're so fucking glum, eh?

21
00:03:13,252 --> 00:03:15,169
All your new riches
weighing you down?

22
00:03:16,544 --> 00:03:18,709
- Move out!
- They're not mine.

23
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:21,460
This all belongs
to the Iron Bank.

24
00:03:21,461 --> 00:03:24,709
See?
We pay our debts.

25
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,544
Right, just not to me.

26
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:31,209
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater,
formerly of...

27
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,667
whatever nameless
shit heap you're from

28
00:03:33,668 --> 00:03:35,585
with a saddlebag full of gold,

29
00:03:35,586 --> 00:03:38,043
complaining about
not getting paid.

30
00:03:38,044 --> 00:03:39,834
When we win this war,

31
00:03:39,835 --> 00:03:41,709
all the castles
in the Seven Kingdoms

32
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,168
will be yours to choose from,

33
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:44,585
with no one left
to take them away from you.

34
00:03:44,586 --> 00:03:46,460
Yes, I'm sure
Queen Cersei's reign

35
00:03:46,461 --> 00:03:47,917
will be quiet and peaceable.

36
00:03:47,918 --> 00:03:49,501
Ah, stranger things
have happened.

37
00:03:49,502 --> 00:03:50,544
Like what?

38
00:03:52,586 --> 00:03:55,543
The granaries are being emptied
and loaded into wagons, my lord.

39
00:03:55,544 --> 00:03:58,376
- The current harvest?
- We have teams of men collecting it

40
00:03:58,377 --> 00:04:00,043
from all the farms in the Reach.

41
00:04:00,044 --> 00:04:02,376
Ser Bronn, will you
accompany the Tarlys

42
00:04:02,377 --> 00:04:04,543
and help them
accelerate this process?

43
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:06,543
I'm not much
for shoveling wheat.

44
00:04:06,544 --> 00:04:11,709
No, but motivating reluctant farmers
to hand over their harvest--

45
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,752
I bet you're going to have
a real talent for that.

46
00:04:15,877 --> 00:04:17,585
My lord.

47
00:04:17,586 --> 00:04:18,710
My lord.

48
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:21,918
My lord.

49
00:04:32,544 --> 00:04:34,834
I must say, I don't
think the Iron Bank

50
00:04:34,835 --> 00:04:39,585
has ever had a debt of this magnitude
repaid in a single installment.

51
00:04:39,586 --> 00:04:43,792
I always considered your father a
very effective and efficient man,

52
00:04:43,793 --> 00:04:47,418
but you appear to be redefining
those terms entirely.

53
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:49,626
You're too kind, my lord.

54
00:04:49,627 --> 00:04:52,792
I am neither kind
nor a lord, Your Grace.

55
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:55,959
I am merely an instrument of
the institution I represent.

56
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,709
Its well-being is a matter
of arithmetic, not sentiment.

57
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:02,793
And the current arithmetic
is outstanding.

58
00:05:04,002 --> 00:05:06,084
- Uh, the gold...
- Is on its way.

59
00:05:06,085 --> 00:05:10,084
My brother is supervising
its transportation himself.

60
00:05:10,085 --> 00:05:13,001
Some at the Iron Bank
will be disappointed.

61
00:05:13,002 --> 00:05:15,751
They've grown rather fond
of your interest payments.

62
00:05:15,752 --> 00:05:19,001
We must devise a way
to raise their spirits.

63
00:05:19,002 --> 00:05:21,460
Yes, perhaps we could
be of assistance

64
00:05:21,461 --> 00:05:24,251
in some current venture.

65
00:05:24,252 --> 00:05:26,209
My only venture at this moment

66
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:28,876
is reestablishing control
over this continent

67
00:05:28,877 --> 00:05:31,168
and every person on it.

68
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:34,001
I see a great deal
of potential in that venture.

69
00:05:34,002 --> 00:05:37,959
I imagine it would require
outside investment.

70
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,209
It will, indeed.

71
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:42,168
I need to expand
my armies, my navies.

72
00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:45,876
My Hand, Qyburn, has made overtures
to the Golden Company in Essos.

73
00:05:45,877 --> 00:05:47,084
I know them well.

74
00:05:47,085 --> 00:05:49,543
They have helped us
recover significant sums

75
00:05:49,544 --> 00:05:52,501
from parties who had
fallen into deep arrears.

76
00:05:52,502 --> 00:05:54,209
That's good to hear.

77
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:57,627
I, too, would like them to recover
some things that belong to me.

78
00:05:59,044 --> 00:06:01,335
Rest assured, Your Grace,

79
00:06:01,336 --> 00:06:04,251
you can count on
the Iron Bank's support.

80
00:06:04,252 --> 00:06:07,294
- Hmm.
- As soon as the gold arrives.

81
00:06:11,044 --> 00:06:12,377
This is for you.

82
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:19,876
The last man who wielded it
meant to cut your throat,

83
00:06:19,877 --> 00:06:21,710
but your mother fought him off.

84
00:06:30,502 --> 00:06:32,543
The other dagger,

85
00:06:32,544 --> 00:06:35,209
the one that took her life,

86
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:38,418
I would have stopped that
dagger with my own heart

87
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:39,835
if I could have.

88
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:44,544
I wasn't there for her
when she needed me most.

89
00:06:46,252 --> 00:06:49,251
But I am here for her now

90
00:06:49,252 --> 00:06:51,959
to do what she would have done,

91
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,918
to protect her children.

92
00:06:56,502 --> 00:07:00,418
Anything I can do
for you, Brandon,

93
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,752
you need only ask.

94
00:07:05,252 --> 00:07:07,959
Do you know
who this belonged to?

95
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,667
No.

96
00:07:10,668 --> 00:07:14,501
That very question was what started
the War of the Five Kings.

97
00:07:14,502 --> 00:07:18,917
In a way, that dagger made
you what you are today.

98
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:20,792
Forced from your home,

99
00:07:20,793 --> 00:07:23,293
driven out to the wilds
beyond the Wall.

100
00:07:23,294 --> 00:07:28,044
I imagine you've seen things
most men wouldn't believe.

101
00:07:37,502 --> 00:07:40,626
To go through all of that
and make your way home again

102
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:45,251
only to find such chaos
in the world,

103
00:07:45,252 --> 00:07:46,293
I can only imagine--

104
00:07:46,294 --> 00:07:48,252
Chaos is a ladder.

105
00:08:00,627 --> 00:08:03,543
I'm sorry to have
disturbed you, Lord Stark.

106
00:08:03,544 --> 00:08:04,960
I'm not Lord Stark.

107
00:08:16,336 --> 00:08:18,460
What's that?

108
00:08:18,461 --> 00:08:20,460
Maester Wolkan built it for me

109
00:08:20,461 --> 00:08:22,001
so I can move around
more easily.

110
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,835
It's a very good idea.

111
00:08:26,668 --> 00:08:28,544
You're leaving.

112
00:08:29,835 --> 00:08:31,501
I don't want to leave you,

113
00:08:31,502 --> 00:08:34,501
but when--
when they come,

114
00:08:34,502 --> 00:08:36,210
I need to be with my family.

115
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:39,293
And you're safe.

116
00:08:39,294 --> 00:08:41,169
Well, as safe
as anyone can be now.

117
00:08:42,294 --> 00:08:44,502
You don't need me anymore.

118
00:08:45,586 --> 00:08:47,127
No, I don't.

119
00:08:51,586 --> 00:08:52,746
That's all you've got to say?

120
00:08:54,336 --> 00:08:55,752
Thank you.

121
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:59,209
Thank you?

122
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:00,877
For helping me.

123
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:05,001
My brother died for you.

124
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:07,709
Hodor and Summer died for you.

125
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:10,044
I almost died for you.

126
00:09:13,877 --> 00:09:16,877
- Bran...
- I'm not, really.

127
00:09:18,835 --> 00:09:20,376
Not anymore.

128
00:09:22,544 --> 00:09:25,834
I remember what it felt
like to be Brandon Stark,

129
00:09:25,835 --> 00:09:29,336
but I remember so much else now.

130
00:09:36,461 --> 00:09:38,044
You died in that cave.

131
00:10:16,419 --> 00:10:17,834
I did.

132
00:10:17,835 --> 00:10:20,251
The kitchen girl,
the redhead with the behind.

133
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:24,917
The only thing in the kitchen that
you've put your cock in is the liver.

134
00:10:24,918 --> 00:10:28,251
'Ey up.
Where you going?

135
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:30,792
In there.
I live here.

136
00:10:30,793 --> 00:10:32,501
Fuck off.

137
00:10:32,502 --> 00:10:34,586
I'm Arya Stark.
This is my home.

138
00:10:38,461 --> 00:10:40,085
Arya Stark's dead.

139
00:10:42,793 --> 00:10:44,917
Send for Maester Luwin
or Ser Rodrick.

140
00:10:44,918 --> 00:10:47,959
- They'll tell you who I am.
- There's no Rodrick here.

141
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,792
Maester's named Wolkan.

142
00:10:49,793 --> 00:10:52,959
Go ask Jon Snow, then,
the King in the North.

143
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,501
- He's my brother.
- He's a thousand miles away.

144
00:10:55,502 --> 00:10:58,293
Look, it's cold and we're busy,

145
00:10:58,294 --> 00:11:01,667
- so, you know, best fuck off.
- Mm.

146
00:11:01,668 --> 00:11:04,544
If Jon's gone, who's in
charge of Winterfell?

147
00:11:05,877 --> 00:11:09,709
The Lady of Winterfell.
Lady Stark.

148
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,418
- Which Lady Stark?
- You tell us.

149
00:11:11,419 --> 00:11:13,169
You're the one
impersonating her sister.

150
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:19,001
Tell Sansa her sister's home.

151
00:11:19,002 --> 00:11:23,335
Lady Sansa is too busy to waste
her breath on you, just like us.

152
00:11:23,336 --> 00:11:26,667
So, for the last time, fuck off.

153
00:11:30,918 --> 00:11:33,792
I'm getting into this castle
one way or another.

154
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:37,293
If I'm not who I say I am,
I won't last long.

155
00:11:37,294 --> 00:11:41,336
But if I am and Sansa finds
out you turned me away...

156
00:11:48,918 --> 00:11:51,543
Right, you sit there.

157
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,751
Right there.

158
00:11:53,752 --> 00:11:54,752
Don't move.

159
00:11:56,377 --> 00:11:58,709
Right, go tell Lady Stark.
I'll watch her.

160
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:02,043
I ain't telling Lady Stark.
You can tell her.

161
00:12:02,044 --> 00:12:03,419
Why me?

162
00:12:28,627 --> 00:12:30,667
- You're gonna tell her.
- I'm not.

163
00:12:30,668 --> 00:12:33,585
'Cause if you don't, I'm gonna hit
you right in the fucking face

164
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,960
as hard as I can.

165
00:12:43,252 --> 00:12:44,709
We told her to wait.

166
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:47,460
We were standing
right next to her, and...

167
00:12:47,461 --> 00:12:49,585
And-- and when we turned
around, she'd gone, my lady.

168
00:12:49,586 --> 00:12:51,460
She-- she was nothing.
Some winter town girl.

169
00:12:51,461 --> 00:12:54,251
She comes in asking
for, uh, Ser Rodrick...

170
00:12:54,252 --> 00:12:56,751
- Rodrick, yeah. Luwin, yeah.
- ...and Maester Luwin.

171
00:12:56,752 --> 00:12:59,168
And don't
trouble yourself over it, my lady.

172
00:12:59,169 --> 00:13:02,376
- We'll-- we'll find her.
- You don't have to.

173
00:13:02,377 --> 00:13:03,876
I know where she is.

174
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,419
Do I have to call you
Lady Stark now?

175
00:13:24,502 --> 00:13:26,127
Yes.

176
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:45,543
You shouldn't have run
from the guards.

177
00:13:45,544 --> 00:13:47,585
I didn't run.

178
00:13:47,586 --> 00:13:48,960
You need better guards.

179
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,793
It suits you...
Lady Stark.

180
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,834
Jon left you in charge?

181
00:14:01,835 --> 00:14:03,210
He did.

182
00:14:04,627 --> 00:14:07,126
I hope he comes back soon.

183
00:14:07,127 --> 00:14:08,959
I remember how happy
he was to see me.

184
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,293
When he sees you, his
heart will probably stop.

185
00:14:22,169 --> 00:14:24,376
It doesn't look like him.

186
00:14:24,377 --> 00:14:27,667
Should've been carved
by someone who knew his face.

187
00:14:27,668 --> 00:14:30,668
Everyone who knew
his face is dead.

188
00:14:33,002 --> 00:14:34,169
We're not.

189
00:14:39,835 --> 00:14:41,917
They say you killed Joffrey.

190
00:14:41,918 --> 00:14:44,209
Did you?

191
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:45,876
I wish I had.

192
00:14:45,877 --> 00:14:48,917
Hmm.
Me, too.

193
00:14:48,918 --> 00:14:51,544
I was angry when I heard
someone else had done it.

194
00:14:53,544 --> 00:14:56,209
However long my list got,
he was always first.

195
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:58,126
Your list?

196
00:14:58,127 --> 00:15:00,336
Of people I'm going to kill.

197
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:12,959
How did you get back
to Winterfell?

198
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,792
It's a long story.

199
00:15:14,793 --> 00:15:16,876
I imagine yours is, too.

200
00:15:16,877 --> 00:15:18,834
Yes.

201
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,959
Not a very pleasant one.

202
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,960
Mine neither.

203
00:15:26,336 --> 00:15:28,709
But our stories aren't over yet.

204
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:31,586
No, they're not.

205
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,085
Arya...

206
00:15:43,668 --> 00:15:44,793
Bran's home, too.

207
00:16:23,127 --> 00:16:24,461
You came home.

208
00:16:38,336 --> 00:16:40,336
I saw you at the crossroads.

209
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:43,501
You saw me?

210
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,001
I see quite a lot now.

211
00:16:46,002 --> 00:16:50,834
Bran has... visions.

212
00:16:50,835 --> 00:16:53,001
I thought you might go
to King's Landing.

213
00:16:53,002 --> 00:16:55,251
So did I.

214
00:16:55,252 --> 00:16:57,126
Why would you go back there?

215
00:16:57,127 --> 00:16:59,710
Cersei's on her list of names.

216
00:17:11,252 --> 00:17:13,126
Who else is on your list?

217
00:17:13,127 --> 00:17:14,877
Most of them are dead already.

218
00:17:26,002 --> 00:17:28,335
Where did you get this?

219
00:17:28,336 --> 00:17:29,752
Littlefinger gave it to me.

220
00:17:31,044 --> 00:17:33,293
Littlefinger?
He's here?

221
00:17:33,294 --> 00:17:35,168
He has declared for House Stark.

222
00:17:35,169 --> 00:17:37,043
Why would he give you a dagger?

223
00:17:37,044 --> 00:17:39,543
- He thought I'd want it.
- Why?

224
00:17:39,544 --> 00:17:41,251
Because it was meant to kill me.

225
00:17:41,252 --> 00:17:46,126
The cutthroat...
after your fall?

226
00:17:46,127 --> 00:17:49,001
Why would a cutthroat
have a Valyrian steel dagger?

227
00:17:49,002 --> 00:17:52,043
Someone very wealthy
wanted me dead.

228
00:17:52,044 --> 00:17:53,209
He's not a generous man.

229
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,585
He wouldn't give you anything

230
00:17:54,586 --> 00:17:56,502
unless he thought he was
getting something back.

231
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:01,876
- It doesn't matter.
- What do you mean it doesn't matter?

232
00:18:01,877 --> 00:18:03,793
I don't want it.

233
00:18:08,085 --> 00:18:09,127
Are you sure?

234
00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:11,834
It's Valyrian steel.

235
00:18:11,835 --> 00:18:14,210
It's wasted on a cripple.

236
00:18:50,002 --> 00:18:53,501
Catelyn Stark would be proud.

237
00:18:53,502 --> 00:18:55,876
You kept your vow.

238
00:18:55,877 --> 00:18:57,293
I did next to nothing.

239
00:18:57,294 --> 00:18:59,209
You're too hard
on yourself, my lady.

240
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:00,793
I'm not a...

241
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,586
Thank you, Podrick.

242
00:19:23,461 --> 00:19:26,834
Your Grace, there's still
no word from the Unsullied.

243
00:19:26,835 --> 00:19:28,501
Soon.

244
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:30,336
He will come back to you.

245
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,544
He'd better.

246
00:19:35,793 --> 00:19:38,501
What happened?

247
00:19:38,502 --> 00:19:39,835
Many things.

248
00:19:43,169 --> 00:19:44,377
Many things?

249
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:47,960
Your Grace.

250
00:19:53,461 --> 00:19:54,960
_

251
00:20:16,044 --> 00:20:17,293
I wanted you to see it

252
00:20:17,294 --> 00:20:20,044
before we start
hacking it to bits.

253
00:20:57,127 --> 00:20:59,960
Well, this is it.
All we'll ever need.

254
00:21:06,002 --> 00:21:09,461
There is something else I
want to show you, Your Grace.

255
00:21:34,586 --> 00:21:36,667
The children of the
forest made these.

256
00:21:36,668 --> 00:21:38,502
When?

257
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:46,294
A very long time ago.

258
00:21:49,461 --> 00:21:51,917
They were right here,

259
00:21:51,918 --> 00:21:54,335
standing where we're standing.

260
00:21:54,336 --> 00:21:59,501
Before there were Targaryens
or Starks or Lannisters.

261
00:21:59,502 --> 00:22:01,586
Maybe even before
there were men.

262
00:22:02,668 --> 00:22:03,918
No.

263
00:22:14,461 --> 00:22:19,168
They were here together,
the children and the First Men.

264
00:22:19,169 --> 00:22:21,377
Doing what?
Fighting each other?

265
00:22:31,918 --> 00:22:36,959
They fought together
against their common enemy.

266
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,835
Despite their differences,
despite their suspicions.

267
00:22:43,002 --> 00:22:44,002
Together.

268
00:22:45,835 --> 00:22:48,918
We need to do the same
if we're going to survive.

269
00:22:52,544 --> 00:22:54,752
Because the enemy is real.

270
00:22:56,377 --> 00:22:58,002
It's always been real.

271
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,293
And you say
you can't defeat them

272
00:23:10,294 --> 00:23:14,209
without my armies
and my dragons?

273
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:16,835
No, I don't think I can.

274
00:23:25,044 --> 00:23:27,335
I will fight for you.

275
00:23:27,336 --> 00:23:29,210
I will fight for the North.

276
00:23:33,294 --> 00:23:35,461
When you bend the knee.

277
00:23:41,085 --> 00:23:42,627
My people...

278
00:23:44,044 --> 00:23:46,335
won't accept a southern ruler.

279
00:23:46,336 --> 00:23:48,877
Not after everything
they've suffered.

280
00:23:52,377 --> 00:23:54,918
They will if their king does.

281
00:23:56,586 --> 00:23:59,585
They chose you to lead them.

282
00:23:59,586 --> 00:24:01,752
They chose you to protect them.

283
00:24:03,377 --> 00:24:06,586
Isn't their survival more
important than your pride?

284
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,043
What is it?

285
00:24:29,044 --> 00:24:31,792
We took Casterly Rock.

286
00:24:31,793 --> 00:24:33,793
That's very good to hear.

287
00:24:38,294 --> 00:24:39,461
Isn't it?

288
00:24:47,502 --> 00:24:49,792
You'll want to discuss
this amongst yourselves.

289
00:24:49,793 --> 00:24:51,461
- Perhaps--
- You will stay.

290
00:24:52,544 --> 00:24:54,543
All my allies are gone.

291
00:24:54,544 --> 00:24:56,959
They've been taken from me while I've
been sitting here on this island.

292
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,501
- You still have the largest armies.
- Who won't be able to eat

293
00:24:59,502 --> 00:25:01,585
because Cersei has taken
all the food from the Reach.

294
00:25:01,586 --> 00:25:03,585
Call Grey Worm
and the Unsullied back.

295
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:06,376
We still have enough ships to carry
the Dothraki to the mainland.

296
00:25:06,377 --> 00:25:08,626
Commit to the blockade
of King's Landing.

297
00:25:08,627 --> 00:25:11,667
- We have a plan. It's still the right plan.
- The right plan!

298
00:25:11,668 --> 00:25:16,460
Your strategy has lost us Dorne,
the Iron Islands, and the Reach.

299
00:25:16,461 --> 00:25:19,876
- If I have underestimated our enemies--
- Our enemies?

300
00:25:19,877 --> 00:25:22,126
Your family, you mean.

301
00:25:22,127 --> 00:25:25,001
Perhaps you don't want
to hurt them after all.

302
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:35,917
Enough with the clever plans.

303
00:25:35,918 --> 00:25:37,585
I have three large dragons.

304
00:25:37,586 --> 00:25:39,293
I'm going to fly them
to the Red Keep.

305
00:25:39,294 --> 00:25:40,626
We've discussed this.

306
00:25:40,627 --> 00:25:43,876
My enemies are in the Red Keep.

307
00:25:43,877 --> 00:25:47,251
What kind of a queen am I if I'm not
willing to risk my life to fight them?

308
00:25:47,252 --> 00:25:49,002
A smart one.

309
00:25:52,377 --> 00:25:54,377
What do you think I should do?

310
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:58,959
- I would never presume to--
- I'm at war.

311
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,002
I'm losing.

312
00:26:02,668 --> 00:26:04,544
What do you think I should do?

313
00:26:11,127 --> 00:26:13,585
I never thought that
dragons would exist again.

314
00:26:13,586 --> 00:26:14,586
No one did.

315
00:26:16,877 --> 00:26:18,709
The people who follow you

316
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,877
know that you made
something impossible happen.

317
00:26:23,252 --> 00:26:24,751
Maybe that helps them believe

318
00:26:24,752 --> 00:26:27,917
that you can make other
impossible things happen.

319
00:26:27,918 --> 00:26:29,876
Build a world that's different

320
00:26:29,877 --> 00:26:32,294
from the shit one
they've always known.

321
00:26:34,544 --> 00:26:38,917
But if you use them to melt
castles and burn cities,

322
00:26:38,918 --> 00:26:40,544
you're not different.

323
00:26:42,252 --> 00:26:44,252
You're just more of the same.

324
00:26:59,085 --> 00:27:00,752
Don't lunge.

325
00:27:13,627 --> 00:27:15,586
Don't go where
your enemy leads you.

326
00:27:17,252 --> 00:27:18,627
Up.

327
00:27:23,627 --> 00:27:26,586
- And don't--
- Don't fight someone like her in the first place.

328
00:27:32,294 --> 00:27:33,793
Nice sword.

329
00:27:36,085 --> 00:27:37,419
Very nice dagger.

330
00:27:44,793 --> 00:27:47,751
If they haven't contributed the right
amount of grain to the stores,

331
00:27:47,752 --> 00:27:50,168
then I'm afraid they'll have to
make due with what they've brought.

332
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:51,461
We can't...

333
00:27:55,793 --> 00:27:57,335
It's been a while
since I trained.

334
00:27:57,336 --> 00:27:59,959
I can go and find the master
of arms for you, my lady.

335
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,834
He didn't beat the Hound.

336
00:28:02,835 --> 00:28:04,876
You did.

337
00:28:04,877 --> 00:28:06,377
I want to train with you.

338
00:28:08,461 --> 00:28:11,751
You swore to serve
both my mother's daughters,

339
00:28:11,752 --> 00:28:12,877
didn't you?

340
00:28:20,544 --> 00:28:22,169
Move aside, Podrick.

341
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:29,126
You can't use that, my lady.
It's too small.

342
00:28:29,127 --> 00:28:31,336
I won't cut you.
Don't worry.

343
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:34,710
I'll try not to.

344
00:29:50,294 --> 00:29:52,293
Who taught you how to do that?

345
00:29:52,294 --> 00:29:53,960
No one.

346
00:30:28,586 --> 00:30:31,251
- What do you think of her?
- Who?

347
00:30:31,252 --> 00:30:35,709
I believe you
know of whom I speak.

348
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:38,043
I think she has a good heart.

349
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:39,834
A good heart?

350
00:30:39,835 --> 00:30:42,501
I've noticed you staring
at her good heart.

351
00:30:42,502 --> 00:30:45,335
There's no time for that.

352
00:30:45,336 --> 00:30:48,169
I saw the Night King, Davos.
I looked into his eyes.

353
00:30:49,668 --> 00:30:52,084
How many men do we have
in the North to fight him?

354
00:30:52,085 --> 00:30:53,626
10,000? Less?

355
00:30:53,627 --> 00:30:55,751
- Fewer.
- What?

356
00:30:55,752 --> 00:30:59,294
Speaking of good hearts--
Missandei of Naath.

357
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:03,293
Ser Davos, Lord Snow.

358
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:04,834
King Snow, isn't it?

359
00:31:04,835 --> 00:31:06,209
No, that doesn't sound right.

360
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:08,084
- King Jon?
- It doesn't matter.

361
00:31:08,085 --> 00:31:10,917
Forgive me, but may
I ask a question?

362
00:31:10,918 --> 00:31:12,876
Of course.

363
00:31:12,877 --> 00:31:16,751
Your name is Jon Snow, but your
father's name was Ned Stark?

364
00:31:16,752 --> 00:31:18,918
I'm a bastard.

365
00:31:20,793 --> 00:31:22,876
My mother and father
weren't married.

366
00:31:22,877 --> 00:31:24,834
Is the custom
different in Naath?

367
00:31:24,835 --> 00:31:26,751
We don't have marriage in Naath,

368
00:31:26,752 --> 00:31:29,709
so the concept of a
bastard doesn't exist.

369
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:33,210
That sounds...
liberating.

370
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:37,418
Why did you leave your homeland?

371
00:31:37,419 --> 00:31:40,043
I was stolen away by slavers.

372
00:31:40,044 --> 00:31:41,543
I'm sorry.

373
00:31:41,544 --> 00:31:44,667
If I may, how did a slave girl

374
00:31:44,668 --> 00:31:46,917
come to advise
Daenerys Targaryen?

375
00:31:46,918 --> 00:31:50,792
She bought me from my
master and set me free.

376
00:31:50,793 --> 00:31:52,585
That was good of her.

377
00:31:52,586 --> 00:31:56,543
Of course, you're serving
her now, aren't you?

378
00:31:56,544 --> 00:32:00,709
I serve my queen because I
want to serve my queen.

379
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,460
Because I believe in her.

380
00:32:02,461 --> 00:32:05,418
And if you wanted to sail
home to Naath tomorrow?

381
00:32:05,419 --> 00:32:08,752
Then she would give me a ship
and wish me good fortune.

382
00:32:09,918 --> 00:32:10,918
You believe that?

383
00:32:12,294 --> 00:32:13,751
I know it.

384
00:32:13,752 --> 00:32:16,751
All of us who came
with her from Essos,

385
00:32:16,752 --> 00:32:18,460
we believe in her.

386
00:32:18,461 --> 00:32:21,126
She's not our queen
because she's the daughter

387
00:32:21,127 --> 00:32:24,251
of some king we never knew.

388
00:32:24,252 --> 00:32:27,044
She's the queen we chose.

389
00:32:28,627 --> 00:32:30,918
Will you forgive me
if I switch sides?

390
00:32:36,169 --> 00:32:38,085
Is that a Greyjoy ship?

391
00:32:55,336 --> 00:32:56,960
Halt!

392
00:33:21,502 --> 00:33:23,169
Jon.

393
00:33:26,336 --> 00:33:27,668
I didn't know you were here.

394
00:33:34,835 --> 00:33:37,002
S-Sansa...

395
00:33:38,668 --> 00:33:41,002
is she all right?

396
00:33:42,044 --> 00:33:44,169
What you did for her...

397
00:33:45,461 --> 00:33:47,502
is the only reason
I'm not killing you.

398
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,543
We heard your uncle
attacked your fleet.

399
00:33:58,544 --> 00:34:01,376
We thought you were dead.

400
00:34:01,377 --> 00:34:03,001
I should be.

401
00:34:03,002 --> 00:34:04,377
Your sister?

402
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:08,501
Euron has her.

403
00:34:08,502 --> 00:34:11,210
I came to ask the queen
to help me get her back.

404
00:34:14,044 --> 00:34:15,502
The queen is gone.

405
00:34:17,377 --> 00:34:19,834
Where did she go?

406
00:34:19,835 --> 00:34:23,419
Get the horses watered!

407
00:34:39,252 --> 00:34:42,084
All the gold's safely through
the gates of King's Landing.

408
00:34:42,085 --> 00:34:43,251
Good.

409
00:34:43,252 --> 00:34:44,585
We need to get
the last of these wagons

410
00:34:44,586 --> 00:34:46,667
over the Blackwater Rush
before nightfall.

411
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:48,376
The head of the line
is ambushed,

412
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:50,667
the tail will never be able
to reinforce in time.

413
00:34:50,668 --> 00:34:52,293
Well, we are stretched
a bit thin.

414
00:34:52,294 --> 00:34:53,751
With your permission,

415
00:34:53,752 --> 00:34:56,918
flogging stragglers has a
marked effect on mobility.

416
00:34:58,668 --> 00:35:01,376
Let's give them
fair warning first.

417
00:35:01,377 --> 00:35:03,294
These men fought well
at Highgarden.

418
00:35:14,252 --> 00:35:16,667
Now, get it on this thing.

419
00:35:16,668 --> 00:35:18,918
Lift!

420
00:35:22,169 --> 00:35:23,917
- Ser Jaime.
- Rickon.

421
00:35:23,918 --> 00:35:25,336
Dickon.

422
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:31,418
I hear you fought bravely
at Highgarden.

423
00:35:31,419 --> 00:35:32,627
Your first battle?

424
00:35:34,461 --> 00:35:36,834
And?

425
00:35:36,835 --> 00:35:38,084
It was glorious.

426
00:35:38,085 --> 00:35:40,627
Come on, your father's not here.

427
00:35:42,127 --> 00:35:45,043
All my life, we've been
pledged to House Tyrell.

428
00:35:45,044 --> 00:35:48,293
I knew some of those men.
I hunted with them.

429
00:35:48,294 --> 00:35:51,043
They didn't deserve to die.

430
00:35:51,044 --> 00:35:53,209
But Lady Olenna
chose to betray her queen

431
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:55,335
and support the Targaryen girl.

432
00:35:55,336 --> 00:35:58,293
So here we are.

433
00:35:58,294 --> 00:36:00,460
I didn't expect it
to smell like that.

434
00:36:00,461 --> 00:36:02,543
Men shit themselves
when they die.

435
00:36:02,544 --> 00:36:04,627
Didn't they teach you that
at fancy lad school?

436
00:36:06,502 --> 00:36:08,668
Well, I learned it
when I was five.

437
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,876
What?

438
00:36:17,877 --> 00:36:19,834
Listen.

439
00:36:31,544 --> 00:36:35,293
Spears and shields!
Spears and shields!

440
00:36:35,294 --> 00:36:36,834
- What is it?
- Get in line!

441
00:36:36,835 --> 00:36:39,835
Spears and shields!
Spears and shields!

442
00:36:41,294 --> 00:36:44,335
Get in line now!

443
00:36:44,336 --> 00:36:46,543
Form up!
Come on, lads!

444
00:36:46,544 --> 00:36:48,126
Guard those wagons!

445
00:36:48,127 --> 00:36:50,586
Form a line!
Form a line!

446
00:36:54,002 --> 00:36:55,710
Round those spears!

447
00:37:02,544 --> 00:37:04,710
Shield wall!

448
00:37:06,044 --> 00:37:07,709
Fill the gaps!

449
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:11,043
- Archers, steady!
- Hold together!

450
00:37:11,044 --> 00:37:13,084
- Archers!
- Look alive!

451
00:37:13,085 --> 00:37:14,876
Get tight!

452
00:37:14,877 --> 00:37:16,709
Get in line, boys!

453
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:19,126
- Ready!
- Here they come!

454
00:37:44,127 --> 00:37:46,460
Courage, lads! Courage!

455
00:37:46,461 --> 00:37:49,376
Wait! Wait for it!

456
00:37:49,377 --> 00:37:51,543
Spears out!

457
00:37:55,752 --> 00:37:59,127
- Spears out!
- Steady! Hold the line!

458
00:38:08,835 --> 00:38:11,418
- Get back to King's Landing.
- I'm not abandoning my army.

459
00:38:11,419 --> 00:38:13,751
You're the commander,
not a damn infantryman.

460
00:38:13,752 --> 00:38:15,793
Those fuckers are
about to swamp us.

461
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,959
We can hold them off.

462
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,460
Dracarys!

463
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:18,626
Hold the line!

464
00:39:18,627 --> 00:39:20,002
Hold!

465
00:39:21,419 --> 00:39:23,544
- Hold it, lads!
- Hold the line!

466
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,877
Throw it!

467
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:33,169
Hold!

468
00:39:55,835 --> 00:39:58,043
Draw!

469
00:39:58,044 --> 00:39:59,044
Loose!

470
00:40:33,918 --> 00:40:36,168
- Archers!
- Archers!

471
00:40:36,169 --> 00:40:37,917
Archers, with me!

472
00:40:37,918 --> 00:40:40,877
- Archers, to the line!
- To the line!

473
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:48,251
- Nock!
- Nock!

474
00:40:48,252 --> 00:40:50,752
Draw!

475
00:40:59,793 --> 00:41:01,461
- Loose!
- Loose!

476
00:41:08,586 --> 00:41:09,793
Run!

477
00:41:21,294 --> 00:41:22,917
Qyburn's scorpion is over there.

478
00:41:22,918 --> 00:41:23,959
Go get it, then.

479
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,461
I can't shoot with one hand.

480
00:41:28,127 --> 00:41:30,461
Come on!

481
00:42:42,419 --> 00:42:44,877
Need help!

482
00:43:46,877 --> 00:43:48,586
Where are you?

483
00:44:11,461 --> 00:44:13,627
_

484
00:44:58,918 --> 00:45:00,668
Take cover!

485
00:45:57,085 --> 00:45:58,460
Come on, you fucker.

486
00:45:58,461 --> 00:45:59,627
Dracarys.

487
00:47:13,044 --> 00:47:14,044
Flee, you idiot.

488
00:47:15,668 --> 00:47:17,668
Come on, boy. Come on!

489
00:47:26,502 --> 00:47:30,376
You idiot.
You fucking idiot.

490
