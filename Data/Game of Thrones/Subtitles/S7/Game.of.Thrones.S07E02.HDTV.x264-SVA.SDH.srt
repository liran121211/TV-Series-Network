00:01:52,867 --> 00:01:55,075
(THUNDER CRASHING)

4
00:02:24,075 --> 00:02:26,866
TYRION: On a night like this,
you came into the world.

5
00:02:26,867 --> 00:02:28,157
VARYS: I remember that storm.

6
00:02:28,158 --> 00:02:30,907
All the dogs in King's Landing

7
00:02:30,908 --> 00:02:32,907
howled through the night.

8
00:02:32,908 --> 00:02:34,533
I wish I could remember it.

9
00:02:34,534 --> 00:02:37,449
I always thought this
would be a homecoming.

10
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,241
Doesn't feel like home.

11
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,575
We won't stay on Dragonstone for long.

12
00:02:41,576 --> 00:02:42,976
Good.

13
00:02:44,284 --> 00:02:46,116
DAENERYS: Not so many lions.

14
00:02:46,117 --> 00:02:49,032
VARYS: Cersei controls fewer
than half the Seven Kingdoms.

15
00:02:49,033 --> 00:02:51,324
The lords of Westeros despise her.

16
00:02:51,325 --> 00:02:54,199
Even before your arrival,
they plotted against her.

17
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,700
- Now...
- They cry out for their true queen?

18
00:02:57,701 --> 00:03:00,324
They drink secret toasts to my health?

19
00:03:00,325 --> 00:03:02,283
People used to tell my
brother that sort of thing,

20
00:03:02,284 --> 00:03:04,325
and he was stupid
enough to believe them.

21
00:03:09,117 --> 00:03:13,157
If Viserys had three dragons
and an army at his back,

22
00:03:13,158 --> 00:03:15,157
he'd have invaded
King's Landing already.

23
00:03:15,158 --> 00:03:17,741
Conquering Westeros
would be easy for you.

24
00:03:17,742 --> 00:03:20,158
But you're not here to
be queen of the ashes.

25
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:22,907
No.

26
00:03:22,908 --> 00:03:25,157
We can take the Seven Kingdoms

27
00:03:25,158 --> 00:03:28,032
without turning it
into a slaughterhouse.

28
00:03:28,033 --> 00:03:30,616
If the great houses support
your claim against Cersei,

29
00:03:30,617 --> 00:03:32,700
the game is won.

30
00:03:32,701 --> 00:03:35,157
With the Tyrell army and
the Dornish on our side,

31
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:38,324
we have powerful allies in the south.

32
00:03:38,325 --> 00:03:40,907
I never properly thanked you for that.

33
00:03:40,908 --> 00:03:43,658
They joined our side, my queen,

34
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:46,199
because they believe in you.

35
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,534
You served my father,
didn't you, Lord Varys?

36
00:03:49,867 --> 00:03:51,157
I did.

37
00:03:51,158 --> 00:03:52,491
And then you served the
man who overthrew him.

38
00:03:52,492 --> 00:03:54,241
I had a choice, Your Grace...

39
00:03:54,242 --> 00:03:56,366
serve Robert Baratheon or
face the headman's axe.

40
00:03:56,367 --> 00:03:58,700
But you didn't serve him long.

41
00:03:58,701 --> 00:04:00,158
You turned against him.

42
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:05,324
Robert was an improvement
on your father, to be sure.

43
00:04:05,325 --> 00:04:07,408
There have been few rulers in history

44
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:09,491
as cruel as the Mad King.

45
00:04:09,492 --> 00:04:11,949
Robert was neither mad nor cruel.

46
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:14,491
He simply had no interest in being king.

47
00:04:14,492 --> 00:04:17,199
So you took it upon yourself
to find a better one.

48
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,408
Your Grace,

49
00:04:19,409 --> 00:04:22,408
when I was ready to drink
myself into a small coffin,

50
00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:24,449
Lord Varys told me about a
queen in the east who...

51
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:27,367
Before I came to power,
you favored my brother.

52
00:04:28,784 --> 00:04:32,074
All your spies, your little birds,

53
00:04:32,075 --> 00:04:35,742
did they tell you Viserys was
cruel, stupid, and weak?

54
00:04:37,867 --> 00:04:42,366
Would those qualities have made for a
good king in your learned opinion?

55
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:45,032
Until your marriage to
Khal Drogo, Your Grace,

56
00:04:45,033 --> 00:04:47,533
I knew nothing about
you, save your existence

57
00:04:47,534 --> 00:04:49,866
and that you were said to be beautiful.

58
00:04:49,867 --> 00:04:53,575
So you and your friends traded me
like a prized horse to the Dothraki.

59
00:04:53,576 --> 00:04:55,575
Which you turned to your advantage.

60
00:04:55,576 --> 00:04:57,617
Who gave the order to kill me?

61
00:05:01,617 --> 00:05:03,658
King Robert.

62
00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:06,408
Who hired the assassins?

63
00:05:06,409 --> 00:05:09,575
Who sent word to Essos to
murder Daenerys Targaryen?

64
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:12,350
Your Grace, I did what
had to be done to...

65
00:05:12,352 --> 00:05:14,116
To keep yourself alive.

66
00:05:14,117 --> 00:05:16,408
Lord Varys has proven
himself a loyal servant.

67
00:05:16,409 --> 00:05:18,199
Proven himself loyal?
Quite the opposite.

68
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,907
If he dislikes one monarch, he
conspires to crown the next one.

69
00:05:21,908 --> 00:05:24,324
What kind of a servant is that?

70
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:26,449
The kind the realm needs.

71
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:29,825
Incompetence should not be
rewarded with blind loyalty.

72
00:05:29,826 --> 00:05:32,784
As long as I have my
eyes, I'll use them.

73
00:05:34,492 --> 00:05:36,491
I wasn't born into a great house.

74
00:05:36,492 --> 00:05:39,074
I came from nothing.

75
00:05:39,075 --> 00:05:42,032
I was sold as a slave and
carved up as an offering.

76
00:05:42,033 --> 00:05:45,866
When I was a child, I lived in
alleys, gutters, abandoned houses.

77
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:48,449
You wish to know where
my true loyalties lie?

78
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:51,658
Not with any king or queen,
but with the people.

79
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:55,616
The people who suffer under despots
and prosper under just rule.

80
00:05:55,617 --> 00:05:57,992
The people whose hearts you aim to win.

81
00:05:59,784 --> 00:06:03,700
If you demand blind allegiance,

82
00:06:03,701 --> 00:06:06,449
I respect your wishes.

83
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:10,449
Grey Worm can behead me or
your dragons can devour me.

84
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:13,032
But if you let me live,
I will serve you well.

85
00:06:13,033 --> 00:06:16,324
I will dedicate myself to
seeing you on the Iron Throne

86
00:06:16,325 --> 00:06:18,825
because I choose you.

87
00:06:18,826 --> 00:06:22,367
Because I know the people have
no better chance than you.

88
00:06:30,659 --> 00:06:32,826
Swear this to me, Varys.

89
00:06:34,325 --> 00:06:37,783
If you ever think I'm
failing the people,

90
00:06:37,784 --> 00:06:40,991
you won't conspire behind my back.

91
00:06:40,992 --> 00:06:42,949
You'll look me in the eye
as you have done today,

92
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,784
and you'll tell me how I'm failing them.

93
00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:49,784
I swear it, my queen.

94
00:06:56,117 --> 00:07:00,032
And I swear this... if
you ever betray me,

95
00:07:00,033 --> 00:07:01,742
I'll burn you alive.

96
00:07:05,075 --> 00:07:08,492
I would expect nothing less
from the Mother of Dragons.

97
00:07:11,576 --> 00:07:13,533
Forgive me, my queen.

98
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:16,701
A red priestess from As'shai
has come to see you.

99
00:07:30,797 --> 00:07:32,627
_

100
00:07:32,747 --> 00:07:34,457
_

101
00:07:34,706 --> 00:07:36,299
_

102
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:38,057
_

103
00:07:38,177 --> 00:07:41,369
_

104
00:07:41,621 --> 00:07:44,409
_

105
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:47,219
_

106
00:07:48,315 --> 00:07:49,896
_

107
00:07:50,294 --> 00:07:52,223
_

108
00:07:52,992 --> 00:07:56,783
She once served another who
wanted the Iron Throne.

109
00:07:56,784 --> 00:08:00,700
It didn't end well for
Stannis Baratheon, did it?

110
00:08:00,701 --> 00:08:02,366
No, it didn't.

111
00:08:02,367 --> 00:08:06,199
You chose an auspicious day
to arrive at Dragonstone.

112
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,074
We've just decided to pardon those

113
00:08:08,075 --> 00:08:10,742
who once served the wrong king.

114
00:08:14,701 --> 00:08:18,074
The Lord of Light doesn't have many
followers in Westeros, does he?

115
00:08:18,075 --> 00:08:21,741
Not yet, but even those who
don't worship the Lord

116
00:08:21,742 --> 00:08:23,241
can serve his cause.

117
00:08:23,242 --> 00:08:25,158
What does your lord expect from me?

118
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:33,492
"The prince who was promised
will bring the dawn."

119
00:08:35,033 --> 00:08:36,783
I'm afraid I'm not a prince.

120
00:08:36,784 --> 00:08:38,366
MISSANDEI: Your Grace, forgive me,

121
00:08:38,367 --> 00:08:41,324
but your translation
is not quite accurate.

122
00:08:41,325 --> 00:08:44,074
That noun has no gender
in High Valyrian,

123
00:08:44,075 --> 00:08:47,032
so the proper translation
for that prophecy would be,

124
00:08:47,033 --> 00:08:51,408
"The prince or princess who was
promised will bring the dawn."

125
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:53,575
Doesn't really roll off
the tongue, does it?

126
00:08:53,576 --> 00:08:55,117
No, but I like it better.

127
00:08:56,701 --> 00:08:58,658
And you believe this
prophecy refers to me?

128
00:08:58,659 --> 00:09:01,449
Prophecies are dangerous things.

129
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:04,783
I believe you have a role to play.

130
00:09:04,784 --> 00:09:06,658
As does another...

131
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:09,158
the King in the North, Jon Snow.

132
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,866
Jon Snow?

133
00:09:11,867 --> 00:09:14,658
- Ned Stark's bastard?
- You know him?

134
00:09:14,659 --> 00:09:17,825
I travelled with him to the Wall
when he joined the Night's Watch.

135
00:09:17,826 --> 00:09:21,949
And why do you think the Lord of
Light singled out this Jon Snow?

136
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,658
Aside from the visions you've
seen in the flames, that is.

137
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:27,575
As Lord Commander of the Night's Watch,

138
00:09:27,576 --> 00:09:29,825
he allowed the wildlings
south of the Wall

139
00:09:29,826 --> 00:09:31,907
to protect them from grave danger.

140
00:09:31,908 --> 00:09:33,491
As King in the North,

141
00:09:33,492 --> 00:09:36,324
he has united those wildlings
with the Northern houses,

142
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:38,825
so together they may
face their common enemy.

143
00:09:38,826 --> 00:09:40,949
He sounds like quite a man.

144
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:43,324
Summon Jon Snow.

145
00:09:43,325 --> 00:09:44,991
Let him stand before you

146
00:09:44,992 --> 00:09:46,616
and tell you the things
that have happened to him,

147
00:09:46,617 --> 00:09:50,242
the things that he has
seen with his own eyes.

148
00:09:51,784 --> 00:09:53,408
I can't speak to prophecies

149
00:09:53,409 --> 00:09:56,032
or visions in the flames,

150
00:09:56,033 --> 00:09:58,825
but I like Jon Snow and I trusted him.

151
00:09:58,826 --> 00:10:01,324
And I am an excellent
judge of character.

152
00:10:01,325 --> 00:10:03,783
If he does rule the North,

153
00:10:03,784 --> 00:10:05,534
he would make a valuable ally.

154
00:10:06,867 --> 00:10:08,783
The Lannisters executed his father

155
00:10:08,784 --> 00:10:10,949
and conspired to murder his brother.

156
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:14,158
Jon Snow has even more reason
to hate Cersei than you do.

157
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,324
Very well.

158
00:10:20,325 --> 00:10:22,116
Send a raven north.

159
00:10:22,117 --> 00:10:24,116
Tell Jon Snow that his queen

160
00:10:24,117 --> 00:10:27,116
invites him to come to Dragonstone...

161
00:10:27,117 --> 00:10:28,867
and bend the knee.

162
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:35,576
(CHATTER)

163
00:10:38,409 --> 00:10:41,408
Gather round. Come here.

164
00:10:41,409 --> 00:10:43,907
SANSA: You think it's really Tyrion?

165
00:10:43,908 --> 00:10:47,408
It could be someone trying
to lure you into a trap.

166
00:10:47,409 --> 00:10:48,949
Read the last bit.

167
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:53,575
"All dwarves are bastards
in their father's eyes."

168
00:10:53,576 --> 00:10:55,324
What does that mean?

169
00:10:55,325 --> 00:10:58,242
It's something he said to
me the first night we met.

170
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:01,409
You know him better than any of us.

171
00:11:02,576 --> 00:11:03,976
What do you think?

172
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,658
Tyrion's not like the other Lannisters.

173
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:13,449
He was always kind to me,
but it's too great a risk.

174
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:15,449
"The Seven Kingdoms will bleed

175
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,949
as long as Cersei sits
on the Iron Throne.

176
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,116
Join us.

177
00:11:19,117 --> 00:11:20,950
Together, we can end her tyranny."

178
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:27,116
Sounds like a charmer.

179
00:11:27,117 --> 00:11:29,324
Of course, the casual mention
of a Dothraki horde,

180
00:11:29,325 --> 00:11:32,283
a legion of Unsullied,
and three dragons...

181
00:11:32,284 --> 00:11:33,826
a bit less charming.

182
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:36,991
What?

183
00:11:36,992 --> 00:11:40,241
Fire kills wights, you told me.

184
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:41,642
What breathes fire?

185
00:11:43,492 --> 00:11:45,616
You're not suggesting Jon meet with her?

186
00:11:45,617 --> 00:11:48,032
- No, too dangerous.
- But?

187
00:11:48,033 --> 00:11:50,991
But if the Army of the Dead
makes it past the Wall,

188
00:11:50,992 --> 00:11:53,492
do we have enough men to fight them?

189
00:11:57,826 --> 00:12:00,199
If the Mad King's daughter
takes the Iron Throne,

190
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,117
she'll destroy the realm as we know it.

191
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:06,366
Some of you are bannermen
of House Tyrell.

192
00:12:06,367 --> 00:12:09,491
But House Tyrell is in open
rebellion against the crown.

193
00:12:09,492 --> 00:12:12,700
With their help, the Mad King's daughter

194
00:12:12,701 --> 00:12:16,199
has ferried an army of
savages to our shores...

195
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,991
mindless Unsullied soldiers who will
destroy your castles and your holdfasts,

196
00:12:19,992 --> 00:12:24,157
Dothraki heathens who will burn
your villages to the ground,

197
00:12:24,158 --> 00:12:26,366
rape and enslave your women,

198
00:12:26,367 --> 00:12:29,283
and butcher your children
without a second thought.

199
00:12:29,284 --> 00:12:34,157
This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards
centuries of service and loyalty.

200
00:12:34,158 --> 00:12:36,991
- (PEOPLE MURMURING)
- CERSEI: You all remember the Mad King.

201
00:12:36,992 --> 00:12:40,533
You remember the horrors he
inflicted upon his people.

202
00:12:40,534 --> 00:12:42,533
His daughter is no different.

203
00:12:42,534 --> 00:12:45,324
In Essos, her brutality
is already legendary.

204
00:12:45,325 --> 00:12:49,616
She crucified hundreds of
noblemen in Slaver's Bay.

205
00:12:49,617 --> 00:12:52,283
And when she grew bored of that,

206
00:12:52,284 --> 00:12:54,533
she fed them to her dragons.

207
00:12:54,534 --> 00:12:58,116
It is my solemn duty to protect
the people, and I will.

208
00:12:58,117 --> 00:13:01,283
But I need your help, my lords.

209
00:13:01,284 --> 00:13:04,075
We must stand together, all of us...

210
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,283
if we hope to stop her.

211
00:13:07,284 --> 00:13:08,992
(ALL MURMURING)

212
00:13:12,617 --> 00:13:15,701
She has three full-grown
dragons, Your Grace.

213
00:13:17,075 --> 00:13:18,866
The same as Aegon when he conquered

214
00:13:18,867 --> 00:13:21,366
the Seven Kingdoms.

215
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,742
How do you propose to stop them?

216
00:13:27,409 --> 00:13:31,534
We are currently at work
on a solution, my lord.

217
00:13:33,284 --> 00:13:35,534
(CHATTER)

218
00:13:38,409 --> 00:13:39,809
Lord Tarly.

219
00:13:41,242 --> 00:13:43,157
Ser Jaime.

220
00:13:43,158 --> 00:13:44,866
I believe you know my son.

221
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:45,867
Ser Jaime.

222
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:47,366
Rickard, isn't it?

223
00:13:47,367 --> 00:13:49,074
Dickon.

224
00:13:49,075 --> 00:13:50,616
That's it.

225
00:13:50,617 --> 00:13:52,616
Thank you for coming.

226
00:13:52,617 --> 00:13:56,533
The other lords of the Reach look to
you for guidance, now more than ever.

227
00:13:56,534 --> 00:13:58,241
They might not have come if you hadn't.

228
00:13:58,242 --> 00:14:01,533
If my queen summons me,
I answer the call.

229
00:14:01,534 --> 00:14:04,325
And I've heard what she
does to those who defy her.

230
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,575
You ride for Horn Hill today?

231
00:14:09,576 --> 00:14:12,283
I have an army to mobilize.

232
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:14,616
Won't be long before
the fighting starts.

233
00:14:14,617 --> 00:14:17,075
And which side will you be fighting for?

234
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:21,408
You were the only man to defeat
Robert Baratheon in battle.

235
00:14:21,409 --> 00:14:23,324
Not even Rhaegar
Targaryen could do that.

236
00:14:23,325 --> 00:14:26,283
It's a long ride back to the
Reach, Ser Jaime. How may I serve?

237
00:14:26,284 --> 00:14:29,241
I want you to be my ranking
general in the wars to come.

238
00:14:29,242 --> 00:14:31,366
I want you to swear allegiance to Cersei

239
00:14:31,367 --> 00:14:34,366
and I want you to help
me destroy her enemies.

240
00:14:34,367 --> 00:14:36,199
All her enemies.

241
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,242
Including Olenna Tyrell.

242
00:14:40,992 --> 00:14:43,491
I'm a Tarly.

243
00:14:43,492 --> 00:14:44,992
That name means something.

244
00:14:46,492 --> 00:14:49,032
We're not oathbreakers.
We're not schemers.

245
00:14:49,033 --> 00:14:51,491
We don't stab our rivals in the back

246
00:14:51,492 --> 00:14:54,325
or cut their throats at weddings.

247
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:59,366
I swore an oath to House Tyrell.

248
00:14:59,367 --> 00:15:02,701
You swore an oath to the
crown as well, Lord Tarly.

249
00:15:04,117 --> 00:15:06,491
I've known Olenna since I was a child.

250
00:15:06,492 --> 00:15:09,116
She was a great woman once.

251
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,491
Now she's broken.

252
00:15:11,492 --> 00:15:13,616
She wants revenge so badly,

253
00:15:13,617 --> 00:15:15,866
she brought the Dothraki to our shores.

254
00:15:15,867 --> 00:15:19,784
The Dothraki in Westeros for
the first time in history.

255
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:24,700
I know you don't like my sister,

256
00:15:24,701 --> 00:15:27,866
but you have to make a choice.

257
00:15:27,867 --> 00:15:29,907
Do you fight with us

258
00:15:29,908 --> 00:15:32,033
or with foreign savages and eunuchs?

259
00:15:37,284 --> 00:15:39,533
When the war is won,

260
00:15:39,534 --> 00:15:42,700
the queen will need a new
Warden of the South.

261
00:15:42,701 --> 00:15:45,533
I can think of no better man

262
00:15:45,534 --> 00:15:47,367
than Randyll Tarly.

263
00:15:49,409 --> 00:15:52,199
EBROSE: The infection
has spread too far.

264
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,158
You should have cut off your arm
the moment you were touched.

265
00:15:57,867 --> 00:15:59,267
How long?

266
00:16:01,742 --> 00:16:03,866
It'll be years before it kills you.

267
00:16:03,867 --> 00:16:05,449
Could be 10.

268
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:07,116
Could be 20.

269
00:16:07,117 --> 00:16:08,867
But how long until...?

270
00:16:10,284 --> 00:16:12,366
Your mind?

271
00:16:12,367 --> 00:16:15,242
Six months, maybe fewer.

272
00:16:22,534 --> 00:16:23,934
(GRUNTS)

273
00:16:27,908 --> 00:16:29,308
Um...

274
00:16:30,576 --> 00:16:33,741
Pardon, Archmaester.

275
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:36,741
I met Stannis Baratheon's
daughter at Castle Black.

276
00:16:36,742 --> 00:16:39,199
She had the greyscale as
a baby and was cured.

277
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,783
- EBROSE: No.
- Isn't there some way...

278
00:16:40,784 --> 00:16:42,575
EBROSE: Does this look
like a baby to you?

279
00:16:42,576 --> 00:16:43,907
- No.
- Have you studied

280
00:16:43,908 --> 00:16:45,949
the varying rates of
greyscale progression

281
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,576
in infants and fully grown men?

282
00:16:49,617 --> 00:16:51,017
No.

283
00:16:52,784 --> 00:16:54,366
EBROSE: Maester Cressen discovered.

284
00:16:54,367 --> 00:16:56,950
Shireen Baratheon's
affliction immediately.

285
00:16:58,409 --> 00:17:00,117
This is quite advanced.

286
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:04,158
And beyond our skills, ser.

287
00:17:07,617 --> 00:17:10,575
Were you a commoner, I'd have
you shipped to Valyria at once

288
00:17:10,576 --> 00:17:13,116
to live out your life
with the stone men.

289
00:17:13,117 --> 00:17:16,950
As an anointed knight, I'll
allow you one more day.

290
00:17:19,742 --> 00:17:22,284
How you choose to spend
that time is up to you.

291
00:17:28,784 --> 00:17:30,184
Come, Samwell.

292
00:17:33,659 --> 00:17:36,534
Should we send word to
your family, Ser...?

293
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:39,558
Jorah.

294
00:17:40,992 --> 00:17:43,491
Jorah Mormont.

295
00:17:43,492 --> 00:17:45,533
Mormont?

296
00:17:45,534 --> 00:17:47,283
There's no need.

297
00:17:47,284 --> 00:17:49,867
I've been dead to them for years.

298
00:17:51,534 --> 00:17:53,200
EBROSE: Come, Samwell!

299
00:18:06,158 --> 00:18:09,074
QYBURN: Have you ever been
down here, Your Grace?

300
00:18:09,075 --> 00:18:10,576
No, I can't say I have.

301
00:18:12,826 --> 00:18:16,283
I haven't seen these since Robert had
them removed from the throne room.

302
00:18:16,284 --> 00:18:20,241
Curious that King Robert did
not have them destroyed.

303
00:18:20,242 --> 00:18:22,408
They were his trophies.

304
00:18:22,409 --> 00:18:23,616
He couldn't keep them around.

305
00:18:23,617 --> 00:18:25,533
They would have made him look small.

306
00:18:25,534 --> 00:18:29,075
Sometimes he would come
down here and look at them.

307
00:18:31,534 --> 00:18:34,242
I believe he brought his
whores on occasion.

308
00:18:41,576 --> 00:18:43,367
Balerion the Dread.

309
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,783
The beast that Aegon
rode across the sea.

310
00:18:47,784 --> 00:18:50,700
His flames forged the Iron Throne

311
00:18:50,701 --> 00:18:53,576
and brought the Seven Kingdoms to heel.

312
00:18:54,742 --> 00:18:56,142
Powerful...

313
00:18:57,033 --> 00:18:58,450
but not invincible.

314
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:06,241
Apparently, one of Daenerys's dragons

315
00:19:06,242 --> 00:19:09,908
was wounded by spears in the
fighting pits of Meereen.

316
00:19:11,409 --> 00:19:13,741
And if they can be wounded,

317
00:19:13,742 --> 00:19:15,142
they can be killed.

318
00:19:17,409 --> 00:19:20,408
The finest artillators and
blacksmiths in King's Landing

319
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,242
have been laboring day
and night, Your Grace.

320
00:19:29,784 --> 00:19:32,284
If you'll kindly pull that lever.

321
00:19:48,742 --> 00:19:51,284
YARA: If you want the
Iron Throne, take it.

322
00:19:53,367 --> 00:19:56,449
We have an army, a fleet,
and three dragons.

323
00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:00,116
We should hit King's Landing now,
hard, with everything we have.

324
00:20:00,117 --> 00:20:02,616
The city will fall within a day.

325
00:20:02,617 --> 00:20:05,533
If we turn the dragons loose, tens of
thousands will die in the firestorms.

326
00:20:05,534 --> 00:20:07,116
It's called war.

327
00:20:07,117 --> 00:20:10,116
You don't have the stomach for
it, scurry back into hiding.

328
00:20:10,117 --> 00:20:11,449
I know how you wage war.

329
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:14,199
We don't poison little girls here.

330
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,491
Myrcella was innocent.

331
00:20:15,492 --> 00:20:16,866
She was a Lannister.

332
00:20:16,867 --> 00:20:19,491
There are no innocent Lannisters.

333
00:20:19,492 --> 00:20:22,783
My greatest regret is that
Oberyn died fighting for you.

334
00:20:22,784 --> 00:20:24,658
DAENERYS: That's enough.

335
00:20:24,659 --> 00:20:26,241
Lord Tyrion is Hand of the Queen.

336
00:20:26,242 --> 00:20:27,659
You will treat him with respect.

337
00:20:31,617 --> 00:20:34,659
I am not here to be queen of the ashes.

338
00:20:35,908 --> 00:20:38,074
That's very nice to hear.

339
00:20:38,075 --> 00:20:40,032
Of course, I can't remember a queen

340
00:20:40,033 --> 00:20:42,991
who was better loved
than my granddaughter.

341
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:44,949
The common people loved her.

342
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,700
The nobles loved her.

343
00:20:46,701 --> 00:20:48,449
And what is left of her now?

344
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:51,283
Ashes.

345
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:52,991
Commoners, nobles,

346
00:20:52,992 --> 00:20:54,866
they're all just children, really.

347
00:20:54,867 --> 00:20:58,492
They won't obey you
unless they fear you.

348
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:02,741
I'm grateful to you, Lady
Olenna, for your counsel.

349
00:21:02,742 --> 00:21:04,658
I'm grateful to all of you.

350
00:21:04,659 --> 00:21:07,283
But you have chosen to follow me.

351
00:21:07,284 --> 00:21:09,658
I will not attack King's Landing.

352
00:21:09,659 --> 00:21:12,491
We will not attack King's Landing.

353
00:21:12,492 --> 00:21:16,157
Then how do you mean to
take the Iron Throne?

354
00:21:16,158 --> 00:21:17,558
By asking nicely?

355
00:21:19,617 --> 00:21:21,032
We will lay siege to the capital,

356
00:21:21,033 --> 00:21:22,741
surrounding the city on all sides.

357
00:21:22,742 --> 00:21:24,533
Cersei will have the Iron Throne,

358
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:26,907
but no food for her army or the people.

359
00:21:26,908 --> 00:21:29,825
But we won't use Dothraki and Unsullied.

360
00:21:29,826 --> 00:21:31,866
Cersei will try to rally
the lords of Westeros

361
00:21:31,867 --> 00:21:33,533
by appealing to their loyalty,

362
00:21:33,534 --> 00:21:35,199

363
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,116
If we besiege the city with foreigners,

364
00:21:37,117 --> 00:21:38,825
we prove her point.

365
00:21:38,826 --> 00:21:40,449
Our army should be Westerosi.

366
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:42,741

368
00:21:44,033 --> 00:21:47,409
Lady Greyjoy will escort
you home to Sunspear.

369
00:21:50,325 --> 00:21:53,408
And her Iron Fleet will
ferry the Dornish army

370
00:21:53,409 --> 00:21:55,408
back up to King's Landing.

371
00:21:55,409 --> 00:21:58,241
The Dornish will lay
siege to the capital

For decades, House Lannister has
been the true power in Westeros.

378

And the seat of that
power is Casterly Rock.

- The lady knight?

- Heard Cersei's queen now.

00:48:10,284 --> 00:48:12,408
The Mountain killed Father.

711
00:48:12,409 --> 00:48:14,157
He'll crush you with one hand.

712
00:48:14,158 --> 00:48:16,907
Father got careless.
That's what Mama says.

713
00:48:16,908 --> 00:48:19,116
Will you shut up about Mama?

714
00:48:19,117 --> 00:48:20,700
"Mama, Mama, Mama."

715
00:48:20,701 --> 00:48:24,575
Maybe I'll kill you both
before we take King's Landing.

716
00:48:24,576 --> 00:48:26,117
And then I won't have to share.

717
00:48:28,617 --> 00:48:30,017
BOTH: "Mama!"

718
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:33,825
How can you drink this piss?

719
00:48:33,826 --> 00:48:35,949
When we reach Sunspear,

720
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:38,491
I'll treat you to a Dornish red.

721
00:48:38,492 --> 00:48:40,907
The best in the world.

722
00:48:40,908 --> 00:48:42,324
Have you ever been to Dorne?

723
00:48:42,325 --> 00:48:44,324
A few times.

724
00:48:44,325 --> 00:48:45,700
Never stayed long.

725
00:48:45,701 --> 00:48:47,242
A boy in every port?

726
00:48:48,367 --> 00:48:49,826
A boy, a girl.

727
00:48:51,367 --> 00:48:52,767
Depends on the port.

728
00:48:56,409 --> 00:48:58,576
Could we get some more?

729
00:48:59,867 --> 00:49:01,741
I thought it wasn't for you.

730
00:49:01,742 --> 00:49:04,033
I'm developing a taste for it.

731
00:49:05,576 --> 00:49:07,826
- He's not your servant.
- It's fine.

732
00:49:09,784 --> 00:49:14,533
So, you're going to be
Queen of the Iron Islands.

733
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:16,366
Once I kill my uncle.

734
00:49:16,367 --> 00:49:18,825
And what will you be, handsome?

735
00:49:18,826 --> 00:49:20,533
Whatever my queen commands.

736
00:49:20,534 --> 00:49:24,366
He'll be my advisor, my protector.

737
00:49:24,367 --> 00:49:26,616
Oh, I see.

738
00:49:26,617 --> 00:49:28,033
Your protector.

739
00:49:29,784 --> 00:49:32,324
So, if someone gets too close to you...

740
00:49:32,325 --> 00:49:34,116
He might have to intervene.

741
00:49:34,117 --> 00:49:35,907
To hold that person back.

742
00:49:35,908 --> 00:49:38,576
Until they've made their
intentions known.

743
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:43,910
Why are you standing all
the way over there, then?

744
00:49:45,409 --> 00:49:47,491
A foreign invasion is underway.

745
00:49:47,492 --> 00:49:49,242
Leave him be.

746
00:49:52,492 --> 00:49:54,617
