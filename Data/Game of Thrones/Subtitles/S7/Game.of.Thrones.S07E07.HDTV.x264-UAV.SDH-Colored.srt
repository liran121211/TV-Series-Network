If you don't submit to me here, now...

172
00:18:06,492 --> 00:18:07,868
I'll kill her.

173
00:18:13,618 --> 00:18:16,074
I think we ought to begin
with larger concerns.

174
00:18:16,075 --> 00:18:18,283
Then why are you talking?

175
00:18:18,284 --> 00:18:20,492
You're the smallest concern here.

176
00:18:22,117 --> 00:18:24,742
Do you remember when we
discussed dwarf jokes?

177
00:18:24,743 --> 00:18:26,491
His wasn't even good.

178
00:18:26,492 --> 00:18:27,825
He explained it at the end.

179
00:18:27,826 --> 00:18:29,366
Never explain. It always ruins it.

180
00:18:29,367 --> 00:18:30,867
We don't even let your kind live

181
00:18:30,868 --> 00:18:34,074
in the Iron Islands, you know?

182
00:18:34,075 --> 00:18:36,283
We kill you at birth.

183
00:18:36,284 --> 00:18:38,325
An act of mercy for the parents.

184
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:40,991
Perhaps you ought to sit down.

185
00:18:40,992 --> 00:18:42,450
Why?

186
00:18:42,451 --> 00:18:44,659
Sit down or leave.

<font color="#80FF00">(LAUGHING)</font>

188
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:08,867
We are a group of people who
do not like one another,

189
00:19:08,868 --> 00:19:11,409
as this recent demonstration has shown.

190
00:19:12,909 --> 00:19:15,199
We have suffered at each other's hands.

191
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,575
We have lost people we love
at each other's hands.

192
00:19:18,576 --> 00:19:20,867
If all we wanted was more of the same,

193
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:23,116
there would be no need
for this gathering.

194
00:19:23,117 --> 00:19:26,158
We are entirely capable of
waging war against each other

195
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:27,867
without meeting face-to-face.

196
00:19:27,868 --> 00:19:29,742
So instead, we should
settle our differences

197
00:19:29,743 --> 00:19:32,408
and live together in harmony
for the rest of our days?

198
00:19:32,409 --> 00:19:33,825
We all know that will never happen.

199
00:19:33,826 --> 00:19:35,200
Then why are we here?

200
00:19:37,534 --> 00:19:40,576
This isn't about living in harmony.

201
00:19:42,075 --> 00:19:43,867
It's just about living.

202
00:19:43,868 --> 00:19:46,450
The same thing is coming for all of us.

203
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:48,491
A general you can't negotiate with.

204
00:19:48,492 --> 00:19:52,241
An army that doesn't leave corpses
behind on the battlefield.

205
00:19:52,242 --> 00:19:55,825
Lord Tyrion tells me a million
people live in this city.

206
00:19:55,826 --> 00:19:59,241
They're about to become a million more
soldiers in the Army of the Dead.

207
00:19:59,242 --> 00:20:01,950
I imagine for most of them
it would be an improvement.

208
00:20:06,117 --> 00:20:07,534
This is serious.

209
00:20:08,992 --> 00:20:10,700
I wouldn't be here if it weren't.

210
00:20:10,701 --> 00:20:12,533
I don't think it's serious at all.

211
00:20:12,534 --> 00:20:13,991
I think it's another bad joke.

212
00:20:13,992 --> 00:20:16,742
If my brother Jaime has
informed me correctly,

213
00:20:16,743 --> 00:20:18,366
you're asking me for a truce.

214
00:20:18,367 --> 00:20:20,909
Yes. That's all.

215
00:20:22,618 --> 00:20:23,992
That's all?

216
00:20:25,367 --> 00:20:26,949
Pull back my armies and stand down

217
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,658
while you go on your monster hunt.

218
00:20:28,659 --> 00:20:31,241
Or while you solidify and
expand your position.

219
00:20:31,242 --> 00:20:35,617
Hard for me to know which it
is with my armies pulled back

220
00:20:35,618 --> 00:20:39,283
until you return and march on my
capital with four times the men.

221
00:20:39,284 --> 00:20:43,618
Your capital will be safe until the
northern threat is dealt with.

222
00:20:45,034 --> 00:20:46,325
You have my word.

223
00:20:46,326 --> 00:20:48,450
The word of a would-be usurper.

224
00:20:48,451 --> 00:20:50,450
There is no conversation

225
00:20:50,451 --> 00:20:54,491
that will erase the last 50 years.

226
00:20:54,492 --> 00:20:56,701
We have something to show you.

How many?

A hundred thousand, at least.

And if you did, I would trust

to Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen.

and honor and oaths.

Talk to the queen.

299
00:27:57,868 --> 00:27:59,242
And tell her what?

then he died for nothing.

305
00:28:27,576 --> 00:28:29,074
I know!

306
00:28:29,075 --> 00:28:31,742
I'm pleased you bent
the knee to our queen.

307
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:34,450
I would have advised it, had you asked.

308
00:28:34,451 --> 00:28:36,408
But have you ever considered

309
00:28:36,409 --> 00:28:38,617
learning how to lie every now and then?

310
00:28:38,618 --> 00:28:39,618
Just a bit?

311
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:43,992
I'm not going to swear
an oath I can't uphold.

312
00:28:45,367 --> 00:28:46,949
Talk about my father if you want,

313
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:50,033
tell me that's the attitude
that got him killed.

314
00:28:50,034 --> 00:28:53,116
But when enough people
make false promises,

315
00:28:53,117 --> 00:28:56,283
words stop meaning anything.

316

Then there are no more answers,
only better and better lies.

317
00:28:59,451 --> 00:29:02,199

324
00:29:17,701 --> 00:29:20,491
and I go and talk to my sister.

to have my Hand murdered.

saved a great deal of trouble.

I go see my sister alone.

331
00:29:39,117 --> 00:29:40,617
Or we all go home

332

and we're right back where we started.

333
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:48,575
- You spoke with her?
- At her until she kicked me out.

334
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:51,658
She thinks I was an idiot to trust you.

335
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:53,783
A lot of people seem to
think that, actually.

336
00:30:53,784 --> 00:30:55,408
I'm about to step into a room

337
00:30:55,409 --> 00:30:57,199
with the most murderous
woman in the world

338
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,116
who's already tried to kill
me twice, that I know of.

339
00:31:01,117 --> 00:31:02,743
Who's an idiot?

340
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,617
I suppose we should say goodbye,

341
00:31:08,618 --> 00:31:10,200
one idiot to another.

342
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:11,033
I shouldn't be surprised, I suppose.

343
00:32:11,034 --> 00:32:12,825
She's your kind of woman...

344
00:32:12,826 --> 00:32:15,366
a foreign whore who
doesn't know her place.

345
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:19,158
A foreign whore you can't
abduct, beat, or intimidate.

346
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:20,867
That must be difficult for you.

347
00:32:20,868 --> 00:32:23,325
So you bring her here
with her pet Northerner,

348
00:32:23,326 --> 00:32:25,241
- whom you've convinced to bow down before her.
- I didn't know about that.

349
00:32:25,242 --> 00:32:27,325
And now you've got them both
working towards the same goal,

350
00:32:27,326 --> 00:32:29,450
the goal you've worked
towards your entire life...

351
00:32:29,451 --> 00:32:32,533
- Cersei, I didn't know.
- the destruction of this family.

352
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:35,867
I am the one preventing
that from happening.

353
00:32:35,868 --> 00:32:38,408
Daenerys didn't want to
debate and negotiate.

354
00:32:38,409 --> 00:32:39,867
She didn't want to bring you words.

355
00:32:39,868 --> 00:32:41,825
She wanted to bring you fire and blood

356
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:43,949
until I advised her otherwise.

357
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:45,742
I don't want to destroy our family.

358
00:32:45,743 --> 00:32:47,700
I never have.

359
00:32:47,701 --> 00:32:49,158
You killed our father.

360
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:50,783
After he sentenced me to death

361
00:32:50,784 --> 00:32:53,366
for a crime I didn't
commit, yes, I killed him.

362
00:32:53,367 --> 00:32:55,033
Hate me for it if you want.

363
00:32:55,034 --> 00:32:57,366
I hate myself for it in
spite of what he was,

364
00:32:57,367 --> 00:32:59,825
in spite of what he did to me.

365
00:32:59,826 --> 00:33:01,575
Oh, poor little man.

366
00:33:01,576 --> 00:33:03,283
Your papa was mean to you.

367
00:33:03,284 --> 00:33:07,325
Do you have any idea what you did
when you fired that crossbow?

368
00:33:07,326 --> 00:33:09,158
You left us open.

369
00:33:09,159 --> 00:33:10,742
You laid us bare for the vultures,

370
00:33:10,743 --> 00:33:14,283
and the vultures came and tore us apart.

371
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:15,949
You may not have killed Joffrey,

372
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:17,867
but you killed Myrcella,
you killed Tommen.

373
00:33:17,868 --> 00:33:19,908
No one would've touched
them if Father was here.

374
00:33:19,909 --> 00:33:22,491
- No one would have dared...
- I have never been more sorry about anything.

375
00:33:22,492 --> 00:33:24,199
I will not hear it, not from you.

376
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,950
I will not hear it!

377
00:33:28,909 --> 00:33:31,241
All right.

378
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:32,700
You love your family,

379
00:33:32,701 --> 00:33:35,783
and I have destroyed it.

380
00:33:35,784 --> 00:33:38,533
I will always be a threat.

381
00:33:38,534 --> 00:33:39,868
So put an end to me.

382
00:33:48,701 --> 00:33:50,908
If it weren't for me,
you'd have a mother.

383
00:33:50,909 --> 00:33:53,658
If it weren't for me,
you'd have a father.

384
00:33:53,659 --> 00:33:54,991
If it weren't for me,

385
00:33:54,992 --> 00:33:57,074
you'd have two beautiful children.

386
00:33:57,075 --> 00:33:59,241
I've thought about killing you

387
00:33:59,242 --> 00:34:00,909
more times than I can count.

388
00:34:02,618 --> 00:34:04,909
Do it! Say the word.

I am more sorry about the children
than you could ever know.

392
00:35:16,826 --> 00:35:19,991
- I will not...
- I don't care. I loved them.

393
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:21,867
You know I did.

394
00:35:21,868 --> 00:35:25,367
You know it in your heart if
there's anything left of it.

395
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:29,200
It doesn't matter.

396
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:34,783
Your love doesn't matter.
Your feelings don't matter.

397
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,949
I don't care why you did what you did.

398
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:39,825
I only care what it cost us.

399
00:35:39,826 --> 00:35:41,200
It cost us our future.

400
00:35:42,868 --> 00:35:44,991
If there's no future,
then why are we here?

401
00:35:44,992 --> 00:35:46,991
Why did you allow me to come?

402
00:35:46,992 --> 00:35:50,033
Not to help my enemies
collaborate in my destruction.

403
00:35:50,034 --> 00:35:51,783
Yes, no, not what you hoped for,

404
00:35:51,784 --> 00:35:54,326
but you must have hoped for something.

405
00:35:55,367 --> 00:35:57,908
What did you hope for?

406
00:35:57,909 --> 00:36:01,575
- To make Jon Snow submit to your queen?
- Mm, not like this.

407
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,949
But eventually, you want everyone
to bend the knee to her.

408
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,700
- Yes.
- Why?

409
00:36:05,701 --> 00:36:07,283
Because I think

410
00:36:07,284 --> 00:36:09,116
she will make the world a better place.

411
00:36:09,117 --> 00:36:11,034
You said she'd destroy King's Landing.

412
00:36:13,242 --> 00:36:15,158
She knows herself.

413
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:16,700
She chose an advisor

414
00:36:16,701 --> 00:36:20,033
who would check her worst
impulses instead of feeding them.

415
00:36:20,034 --> 00:36:22,033
That's the difference between you.

416
00:36:22,034 --> 00:36:24,241
I don't care about checking
my worst impulses.

417
00:36:24,242 --> 00:36:26,867
I don't care about making
the world a better place.

418
00:36:26,868 --> 00:36:28,658
Hang the world.

419
00:36:28,659 --> 00:36:31,116
That thing you dragged here,

420
00:36:31,117 --> 00:36:34,575
I know what it is, I know what it means.

421
00:36:34,576 --> 00:36:36,783
And when it came at me, I
didn't think about the world.

422
00:36:36,784 --> 00:36:38,867
Not at all.

423
00:36:38,868 --> 00:36:40,450
As soon as it opened its mouth,

424
00:36:40,451 --> 00:36:41,825
the world disappeared for me,

425
00:36:41,826 --> 00:36:43,949
right down its black throat.

426
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:46,325
All I could think about was
keeping those gnashing teeth

427
00:36:46,326 --> 00:36:47,867
away from the ones who matter most,

428
00:36:47,868 --> 00:36:49,658
away from my family.

429
00:36:49,659 --> 00:36:53,283
Maybe Euron Greyjoy had the right idea.

430
00:36:53,284 --> 00:36:56,074
Get on a boat, take those who matter...

431
00:36:56,075 --> 00:36:57,242
You're pregnant.

I know.

435
00:37:36,492 --> 00:37:38,991
I respect what you did.

436
00:37:38,992 --> 00:37:41,326
Wish you hadn't done
it, but I respect it.

437
00:37:51,992 --> 00:37:55,492
This place was the beginning
of the end for my family.

A dragon is not a slave.

440
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:09,116
They were terrifying.

441
00:38:09,117 --> 00:38:10,826
Extraordinary.

442
00:38:12,242 --> 00:38:15,283
They filled people with wonder and awe,

443
00:38:15,284 --> 00:38:17,534
and we locked them in here.

444
00:38:18,826 --> 00:38:20,367
They wasted away.

445
00:38:21,576 --> 00:38:23,867
They grew small.

446
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:26,492
And we grew small as well.

447
00:38:27,826 --> 00:38:30,408
We weren't extraordinary without them.

448
00:38:30,409 --> 00:38:32,242
We were just like everyone else.

449
00:38:37,284 --> 00:38:39,200
You're not like everyone else.

450
00:38:45,075 --> 00:38:47,534
And your family hasn't seen its end.

451
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:50,325
You're still here.

452
00:38:50,326 --> 00:38:52,867
I can't have children.

453
00:38:52,868 --> 00:38:54,450
Who told you that?

454
00:38:54,451 --> 00:38:57,408
The witch who murdered my husband.

455
00:38:57,409 --> 00:38:59,617
Has it occurred to you
she might not have been

456
00:38:59,618 --> 00:39:01,409
a reliable source of information?

457
00:39:07,242 --> 00:39:09,366
You were right from the beginning.

458
00:39:09,367 --> 00:39:12,576
If I had trusted you,
everything would be different.

459
00:39:16,659 --> 00:39:18,075
So, what now?

460
00:39:21,992 --> 00:39:24,575
I can't forget what I
saw north of the Wall.

461
00:39:24,576 --> 00:39:26,491
And I can't pretend that Cersei

462
00:39:26,492 --> 00:39:29,784
won't take back half the country
the moment I march north.

463
00:39:31,909 --> 00:39:34,409
It appears Tyrion's
assessment was correct.

464
00:39:36,826 --> 00:39:37,909

He never asked for my opinion.

I can't believe he'd surrender the

He pledged to fight for
Daenerys Targaryen.

He's bent the knee.

488
00:41:51,492 --> 00:41:54,074
I've heard gossip

489
00:41:54,075 --> 00:41:58,074
that the Dragon Queen
is quite beautiful.

490
00:41:58,075 --> 00:42:00,284
What does that have to do with anything?

491
00:42:02,576 --> 00:42:05,325
Jon is young and unmarried.

492
00:42:05,326 --> 00:42:07,533
Daenerys is young and unmarried.

493
00:42:07,534 --> 00:42:10,491
You think he wants to marry her?

494
00:42:10,492 --> 00:42:13,742
An alliance makes sense.

495
00:42:13,743 --> 00:42:15,950
Together, they'd be difficult to defeat.

496
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:20,576
He was named King in the North.

497
00:42:22,992 --> 00:42:24,409
He can be unnamed.

498
00:42:28,242 --> 00:42:30,908
Even if I wanted to, Arya
would never go along.

499
00:42:30,909 --> 00:42:33,742
She always loved Jon far
more than she ever loved me,

500
00:42:33,743 --> 00:42:36,949
and she'd kill anyone who
betrayed her family.

501
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:38,950
You are family, too.

502
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:43,533
Would Arya really murder her own sister?

503
00:42:43,534 --> 00:42:45,867
Do you know what she is now?

504
00:42:45,868 --> 00:42:49,241
Do you know what the Faceless Men are?

505
00:42:49,242 --> 00:42:51,450
Only by reputation.

506
00:42:51,451 --> 00:42:54,617
They worship the God
of Death, I believe.

507
00:42:54,618 --> 00:42:57,241
I never trust godly men.

508
00:42:57,242 --> 00:42:58,742
They're killers.

509
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:00,618
And Arya was one of them.

510
00:43:05,492 --> 00:43:07,074
What do you think she's after?

511
00:43:07,075 --> 00:43:09,658
She's your sister.

512
00:43:09,659 --> 00:43:11,784
You know her far better
than I ever could.

513
00:43:15,326 --> 00:43:20,074
Sometimes when I try to
understand a person's motives,

514
00:43:20,075 --> 00:43:21,992
I play a little game.

515
00:43:24,492 --> 00:43:26,492
I assume the worst.

516
00:43:29,492 --> 00:43:32,325
What's the worst reason
they could possibly have

517
00:43:32,326 --> 00:43:37,283
for saying what they say
and doing what they do?

518
00:43:37,284 --> 00:43:39,491
Then I ask myself,

519
00:43:39,492 --> 00:43:42,658
"How well does that reason explain

520
00:43:42,659 --> 00:43:45,618
what they say and what they do?"

521
00:43:47,451 --> 00:43:48,991
So, tell me...

522
00:43:48,992 --> 00:43:51,534
what's the worst thing she could want?

523
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:59,366
She could want me dead

524
00:43:59,367 --> 00:44:02,575
because she thinks I wronged my family.

525
00:44:02,576 --> 00:44:04,868
Why did she come to Winterfell?

526
00:44:08,075 --> 00:44:10,033
To kill me

527
00:44:10,034 --> 00:44:13,867
for marrying our enemies
and betraying my family.

528
00:44:13,868 --> 00:44:16,868
Why did she unearth the
letter Cersei made you write?

529
00:44:19,576 --> 00:44:23,658
To provide proof of my betrayals.

530
00:44:23,659 --> 00:44:28,408
To provide justification
after she murders me.

531
00:44:28,409 --> 00:44:32,074
And after she murders you,

532
00:44:32,075 --> 00:44:34,743
what does she become?

533
00:44:40,242 --> 00:44:41,950
Lady of Winterfell.

534
00:44:54,117 --> 00:44:56,991
<font color="#80FF00">(WAVES CRASHING)</font>

535
00:44:56,992 --> 00:44:59,908
If we have the Dothraki
ride hard on the kingsroad,

536
00:44:59,909 --> 00:45:02,575
they'll arrive at Winterfell
within the fortnight.

537
00:45:02,576 --> 00:45:04,074
And the Unsullied?

538
00:45:04,075 --> 00:45:05,700
We can sail with them to White Harbor,

539
00:45:05,701 --> 00:45:08,408
meet the Dothraki here on the kingsroad,

540
00:45:08,409 --> 00:45:11,366
then ride together to Winterfell.

541
00:45:11,367 --> 00:45:14,617
Perhaps you should fly to
Winterfell, Your Grace.

542
00:45:14,618 --> 00:45:17,116
You have many enemies in the North.

543
00:45:17,117 --> 00:45:19,366
Thousands fell fighting your father.

544
00:45:19,367 --> 00:45:23,074
All it takes is one angry
man with a crossbow.

545
00:45:23,075 --> 00:45:25,283
He'll see your silver
hair on the kingsroad

546
00:45:25,284 --> 00:45:28,325
and know that one well-placed
bolt will make him a hero.

547
00:45:28,326 --> 00:45:30,950
The man who killed the conqueror.

548
00:45:32,492 --> 00:45:34,283
<font color="#00ffff">JON</font>: It's your decision, Your Grace.

549
00:45:34,284 --> 00:45:37,491
But if we're going to
be allies in this war,

550
00:45:37,492 --> 00:45:41,575
it's important for the
Northerners to see us as allies.

551
00:45:41,576 --> 00:45:44,742
If we sail to White Harbor together,

552
00:45:44,743 --> 00:45:46,992
I think it sends a better message.

553
00:45:53,451 --> 00:45:56,199
I've not come to conquer the North.

554
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,534
I'm coming to save the North.

555
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:05,492
We sail together.

556
00:46:20,659 --> 00:46:21,659
Jon.

557
00:46:23,826 --> 00:46:25,159
Can I speak with you?

558
00:46:28,492 --> 00:46:29,618
All right.

559
00:46:35,492 --> 00:46:38,074
What you did in King's Landing,

560
00:46:38,075 --> 00:46:40,200
what you said...

561
00:46:42,367 --> 00:46:45,783
you could've lied to Cersei

562
00:46:45,784 --> 00:46:48,701
about bending the knee to Daenerys.

563
00:46:52,701 --> 00:46:55,159
You risked everything to
tell an enemy the truth.

564
00:46:57,075 --> 00:46:59,533
We went down there to make peace.

565
00:46:59,534 --> 00:47:03,033
And it seems to me we need
to be honest with each other

566
00:47:03,034 --> 00:47:04,409
if we're going to fight together.

567
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:08,409
You've always known what was right.

568
00:47:11,909 --> 00:47:15,199
Even when we were all young and stupid,

569
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,700
you always knew.

570
00:47:16,701 --> 00:47:18,950
Every step you take...

571
00:47:20,409 --> 00:47:22,283
it's always the right step.

572
00:47:22,284 --> 00:47:23,408
It's not.

573
00:47:23,409 --> 00:47:25,658
It may seem that way from the outside,

574
00:47:25,659 --> 00:47:29,075
but I promise you, it's not true.

575
00:47:31,492 --> 00:47:34,074
I've done plenty of
things that I regret.

576
00:47:34,075 --> 00:47:35,783
Not compared to me, you haven't.

577
00:47:35,784 --> 00:47:37,409
No.

578
00:47:39,242 --> 00:47:41,034
Not compared to you.

579
00:47:52,284 --> 00:47:54,909
I always wanted to do the right thing.

580
00:47:57,576 --> 00:47:59,658
Be the right kind of person.

581
00:47:59,659 --> 00:48:02,242
But I never knew what that meant.

582
00:48:03,659 --> 00:48:05,992
It always seemed like there's...

583
00:48:10,075 --> 00:48:12,492
like there was an impossible
choice I had to make.

584
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:16,743
Stark or Greyjoy.

585
00:48:19,992 --> 00:48:24,617
Our father was more of a father
to you than yours ever was.

586
00:48:24,618 --> 00:48:27,450
- He was.
- And you betrayed him.

587
00:48:27,451 --> 00:48:29,325
Betrayed his memory.

588
00:48:29,326 --> 00:48:30,326
I did.

<font color="#80FF00">(SIGHS)</font>

590
00:48:35,326 --> 00:48:37,075
But you never lost him.

591
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:43,034
He's a part of you.

592
00:48:44,576 --> 00:48:46,325
Just like he's a part of me.

593
00:48:46,326 --> 00:48:48,492
But the things I've done...

594
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:52,950
It's not my place to
forgive you for all of it.

595
00:48:56,326 --> 00:48:59,533
But what I can forgive,

596
00:48:59,534 --> 00:49:00,950
I do.

597
00:49:07,326 --> 00:49:09,492
You don't need to choose.

598
00:49:10,826 --> 00:49:12,784
You're a Greyjoy...

599
00:49:14,992 --> 00:49:16,326
and you're a Stark.

600
00:49:30,034 --> 00:49:32,949
When I was Ramsay's prisoner,

601
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:36,991
Yara tried to save me.

602
00:49:36,992 --> 00:49:40,533
She's the only one

603
00:49:40,534 --> 00:49:42,492
who tried to save me.

611
00:50:35,367 --> 00:50:39,199
We left the Iron Islands for Yara.

612
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,034
She would never leave one of us behind.

613
00:50:44,909 --> 00:50:46,617
We're not leaving her behind.

614
00:50:46,618 --> 00:50:48,074
Your sister's dead.

615
00:50:48,075 --> 00:50:49,783
- She's not dead.
- She's dead.

616
00:50:49,784 --> 00:50:52,658
Even if Euron hasn't cut her
throat yet, she's dead.

617
00:50:52,659 --> 00:50:57,783
- She's our queen.
- She's your sister, and you left her to die.

618
00:50:57,784 --> 00:50:59,284
I did.

619
00:51:01,659 --> 00:51:04,533
I ran from my uncle.

620
00:51:04,534 --> 00:51:05,949
I was a coward.

should we listen to you?

find a nice, quiet island,

625

kill all the men, and take
their wives for ourselves.

626
00:51:19,784 --> 00:51:22,199
- We're done with all that.
- Who says we are?

627
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:25,117
Yara did. She made a pledge.

628
00:51:27,034 --> 00:51:30,199
We're going to find her,

All right, then.

Get on with it.

You stand accused of murder.

661
00:56:07,909 --> 00:56:10,742
You stand accused of treason.

662
00:56:10,743 --> 00:56:13,534
How do you answer these charges...

664
00:56:33,534 --> 00:56:35,075
My sister asked you a question.

Lady Sansa, forgive me...

666
00:56:42,950 --> 00:56:44,742
I'm a bit confused.

667
00:56:44,743 --> 00:56:47,033
Which charges confuse you?

668
00:56:47,034 --> 00:56:49,074
Let's start with the simplest one...

669
00:56:49,075 --> 00:56:51,658
you murdered our aunt, Lysa Arryn.

670
00:56:51,659 --> 00:56:54,533
You pushed her through the Moon
Door and watched her fall.

671
00:56:54,534 --> 00:56:56,409
Do you deny it?

672
00:56:58,451 --> 00:56:59,949
I did it to protect you.

673
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:01,991
You did it to take power in the Vale.

674
00:57:01,992 --> 00:57:05,283
Earlier, you conspired
to murder Jon Arryn.

675
00:57:05,284 --> 00:57:07,783
You gave Lysa Tears
of Lys to poison him.

676
00:57:07,784 --> 00:57:08,826
Do you deny it?

677
00:57:11,159 --> 00:57:14,325
Whatever your aunt
might have told you...

678
00:57:14,326 --> 00:57:16,659
she was a troubled woman.

679
00:57:17,992 --> 00:57:19,283
She imagined enemies everywhere.

680
00:57:19,284 --> 00:57:21,658
You had Aunt Lysa send a
letter to our parents

681
00:57:21,659 --> 00:57:24,158
telling them it was the
Lannisters who murdered Jon Arryn

682
00:57:24,159 --> 00:57:25,658
when, really, it was you.

683
00:57:25,659 --> 00:57:27,867
The conflict between the
Starks and the Lannisters,

684
00:57:27,868 --> 00:57:29,366
it was you who started it.

685
00:57:29,367 --> 00:57:30,450
Do you deny it?

686
00:57:30,451 --> 00:57:32,074
I know of no such letter.

687
00:57:32,075 --> 00:57:33,908
You conspired with Cersei Lannister

688
00:57:33,909 --> 00:57:37,617
and Joffrey Baratheon to
betray our father, Ned Stark.

689
00:57:37,618 --> 00:57:40,158
Thanks to your treachery,
he was imprisoned

690
00:57:40,159 --> 00:57:43,617
and later executed on
false charges of treason.

691
00:57:43,618 --> 00:57:46,450
- Do you deny it?
- I deny it!

692
00:57:46,451 --> 00:57:49,825
None of you were there
to see what happened.

693
00:57:49,826 --> 00:57:51,783
None of you knows the truth.

694
00:57:51,784 --> 00:57:53,701
You held a knife to his throat.

695
00:57:58,909 --> 00:58:01,534
You said, "I did warn
you not the trust me."

696
00:58:04,868 --> 00:58:09,534
You told our mother this knife
belonged to Tyrion Lannister.

697
00:58:10,868 --> 00:58:12,742
But that was another one of your lies.

698
00:58:12,743 --> 00:58:14,576
It was yours.

699
00:58:19,701 --> 00:58:22,617
Lady Sansa, I have known
you since you were a girl.

700
00:58:22,618 --> 00:58:25,283
- I've protected you.
- Protected me?

701
00:58:25,284 --> 00:58:27,409
By selling me to the Boltons?

702
00:58:28,743 --> 00:58:31,074
If we could speak alone,

703
00:58:31,075 --> 00:58:32,618
I can explain everything.

704
00:58:34,826 --> 00:58:37,949
Sometimes when I'm trying to
understand a person's motives,

705
00:58:37,950 --> 00:58:40,533
I play a little game.

706
00:58:40,534 --> 00:58:42,200
I assume the worst.

707
00:58:43,576 --> 00:58:45,491
What's the worst reason you have

708
00:58:45,492 --> 00:58:47,409
for turning me against my sister?

709
00:58:49,242 --> 00:58:51,325
That's what you do, isn't it?

710
00:58:51,326 --> 00:58:53,158
That's what you've always done...

711
00:58:53,159 --> 00:58:54,991
turn family against family,

712
00:58:54,992 --> 00:58:56,908
turn sister against sister.

713
00:58:56,909 --> 00:58:59,116
That's what you did to our
mother and Aunt Lysa,

714
00:58:59,117 --> 00:59:01,325
and that's what you tried to do to us.

715
00:59:01,326 --> 00:59:02,658
Sansa, please.

716
00:59:02,659 --> 00:59:06,491
I'm a slow learner, it's true.

717
00:59:06,492 --> 00:59:07,949
But I learn.

718
00:59:07,950 --> 00:59:10,199
Give me a chance to defend myself.

719
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,492
I deserve that.

720
00:59:17,326 --> 00:59:18,908
I am Lord Protector of the Vale

721
00:59:18,909 --> 00:59:21,283
and I command you to escort
me safely back to the Eyrie.

722
00:59:21,284 --> 00:59:22,576
I think not.

723
00:59:25,868 --> 00:59:28,576
Sansa, I beg you!

724
00:59:30,075 --> 00:59:32,116
I loved your mother since
the time I was a boy.

725
00:59:32,117 --> 00:59:33,909
And yet, you betrayed her.

726
00:59:35,950 --> 00:59:39,116
I loved you.

727
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:40,743
More than anyone.

728
00:59:41,868 --> 00:59:43,659
And yet, you betrayed me.

729
00:59:46,284 --> 00:59:48,033
When you brought me back to Winterfell,

730
00:59:48,034 --> 00:59:50,575
you told me there's no
justice in the world,

731
00:59:50,576 --> 00:59:52,784
not unless we make it.

732
00:59:54,784 --> 00:59:59,199
Thank you for all your many
lessons, Lord Baelish.

733
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,492
I will never forget them.

734
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:06,200
Sansa!

736
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,326

<font color="#00ffff">JAIME</font>: Our men in King's Landing

738

<font color="#00ffff">MAN</font>: It'll take us a fortnight

740
01:00:41,909 --> 01:00:43,241

<font color="#00ffff">JAIME</font>: We don't have a fortnight.

742
01:00:44,784 --> 01:00:46,783
If the North falls, we fall. Three days.

743
01:00:46,784 --> 01:00:48,325
The remaining forces in the Westerlands

744
01:00:48,326 --> 01:00:50,033
will take the river road east.

745
01:00:50,034 --> 01:00:51,575
We'll meet at Lord Harroway's Town

746
01:00:51,576 --> 01:00:53,575
and march together to Winterfell.

747
01:00:53,576 --> 01:00:54,743
Ser Jaime.

748
01:00:55,868 --> 01:00:57,241
Your Grace.

749
01:00:57,242 --> 01:00:59,701
My lords, I need a
moment with my brother.

750
01:01:01,326 --> 01:01:03,159
<font color="#00ffff">MEN</font>: Your Grace.

751
01:01:06,367 --> 01:01:10,199
- What are you doing?
- Preparing the expedition north.

752
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,783
Expedition north?

753
01:01:12,784 --> 01:01:16,074
I always knew you were
the stupidest Lannister.

754
01:01:16,075 --> 01:01:18,742
The Starks and Targaryens
have united against us,

755
01:01:18,743 --> 01:01:20,867
and you want to fight alongside them?

756
01:01:20,868 --> 01:01:22,825
Are you a traitor or an idiot?

757
01:01:22,826 --> 01:01:24,783
You pledged our forces to
fight our common enemy...

758
01:01:24,784 --> 01:01:26,241
I'll say whatever I need to say

759
01:01:26,242 --> 01:01:27,949
to ensure the survival of our house.

760
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:30,700
You expect me to trust the
man who murdered our father?

761
01:01:30,701 --> 01:01:34,283
You expect me to command our troops
to fight beside foreign scum,

762
01:01:34,284 --> 01:01:35,783
to fight for the Dragon Queen?

763
01:01:35,784 --> 01:01:37,700
You saw it with your own eyes.

764
01:01:37,701 --> 01:01:40,074
You saw a dead man trying to kill us.

765
01:01:40,075 --> 01:01:41,908
I saw it burn.

766
01:01:41,909 --> 01:01:43,742
If dragons can't stop them,

767
01:01:43,743 --> 01:01:46,783
if Dothraki and Unsullied and
Northmen can't stop them,

768
01:01:46,784 --> 01:01:48,783
how will our armies make a difference?

769
01:01:48,784 --> 01:01:50,783
This isn't about noble houses,

770
01:01:50,784 --> 01:01:52,908
this is about the living and the dead!

771
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:54,949
And I intend to stay amongst the living.

772
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:58,158
Let the Stark boy and his
new queen defend the North.

773
01:01:58,159 --> 01:02:00,366
We stay here where we've always been.

774
01:02:00,367 --> 01:02:02,909
I made a promise.

775
01:02:05,075 --> 01:02:08,491
Our child will rule Westeros.

776
01:02:08,492 --> 01:02:13,366
Our child will never be born
if the dead come south.

777
01:02:13,367 --> 01:02:14,949
The monsters are real.

778
01:02:14,950 --> 01:02:17,074
The white walkers,

779
01:02:17,075 --> 01:02:19,325
the dragons, the Dothraki screamers...

780
01:02:19,326 --> 01:02:23,325
all the frightening stories we heard
when we were young, they're all real.

781
01:02:23,326 --> 01:02:25,033
So be it.

782
01:02:25,034 --> 01:02:27,158
Let the monsters kill each other.

783
01:02:27,159 --> 01:02:29,408
And while they battle in the North,

784
01:02:29,409 --> 01:02:31,825
we take back the lands
that belong to us.

785
01:02:31,826 --> 01:02:34,617
- And then what?
- And then we rule.

786
01:02:34,618 --> 01:02:37,533
When the fighting in the
North is over, someone wins.

787
01:02:37,534 --> 01:02:39,700
You understand that, don't you?

788
01:02:39,701 --> 01:02:43,199
If the dead win, they march
south and kill us all.

789
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:46,283
If the living win, and
we've betrayed them,

790
01:02:46,284 --> 01:02:48,241
they march south and kill us all!

791
01:02:48,242 --> 01:02:51,241
The Targaryens and the Starks
already want to kill us all.

792
01:02:51,242 --> 01:02:52,658
Most of them will die in the North.

793
01:02:52,659 --> 01:02:54,241
I faced them in the field.

794
01:02:54,242 --> 01:02:56,783
We can't beat them. We
can't beat their dragons.

795
01:02:56,784 --> 01:02:58,325
How many dragons did you see at the pit?

796
01:02:58,326 --> 01:03:00,325
- Two.
- What happened to the third?

797
01:03:00,326 --> 01:03:02,825
For all we know, it's
guarding her fleet!

798
01:03:02,826 --> 01:03:06,158
She came here with her dragons and
her Dothraki and her Unsullied.

799
01:03:06,159 --> 01:03:08,949
She came here to show us all her power.

800
01:03:08,950 --> 01:03:11,991
No, something happened. The
dragons are vulnerable.

801
01:03:11,992 --> 01:03:14,533
We can't beat the Dothraki.
We don't have the numbers.

802
01:03:14,534 --> 01:03:16,366
We don't have the support
of the other houses!

803
01:03:16,367 --> 01:03:19,034
No, we have something better.
We have the Iron Bank.

804
01:03:21,034 --> 01:03:24,991
You should've listened more when Father
spoke about the importance of gold.

805
01:03:24,992 --> 01:03:27,158
Oh, I know it's boring for you.

806
01:03:27,159 --> 01:03:30,783
You just wanted to hunt
and ride and fight.

807
01:03:30,784 --> 01:03:33,366
But I listened, I learned.

808
01:03:33,367 --> 01:03:37,366
Highgarden bought us the most
powerful army in Essos...

809
01:03:37,367 --> 01:03:39,158
the Golden Company.

810
01:03:39,159 --> 01:03:42,867
20,000 men, horses,
elephants, I believe.

811
01:03:42,868 --> 01:03:44,533
The Golden Company is not here.

812
01:03:44,534 --> 01:03:45,908
They're in Essos.

813
01:03:45,909 --> 01:03:49,867
How is a mercenary company
in Essos going to help us?

814
01:03:49,868 --> 01:03:52,366
Do you really think Euron
Greyjoy turned tail

815
01:03:52,367 --> 01:03:53,992
and sailed back to the Iron Islands?

816
01:03:55,117 --> 01:03:56,491
Do you think he abandoned

817
01:03:56,492 --> 01:03:59,742
the chance to marry the queen?

818
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:02,075
No one walks away from me.

819
01:04:03,909 --> 01:04:05,575
He's sailing with his fleet to Essos.

820
01:04:05,576 --> 01:04:07,658
He's going to ferry the
Golden Company back here

821
01:04:07,659 --> 01:04:09,200
to help us win the war for Westeros.

822
01:04:11,743 --> 01:04:14,908
You plotted with Euron
Greyjoy without telling me,

823
01:04:14,909 --> 01:04:16,742
the commander of your armies?

824
01:04:16,743 --> 01:04:19,366
And you conspired with Tyrion,

825
01:04:19,367 --> 01:04:20,742
the man who murdered our father,

826
01:04:20,743 --> 01:04:22,074
without telling me, your queen.

827
01:04:22,075 --> 01:04:23,533
I didn't conspire with him.

828
01:04:23,534 --> 01:04:25,408
You met with him in secret
without my consent.

829
01:04:25,409 --> 01:04:27,408
You planned to promote
my enemies' interests.

830
01:04:27,409 --> 01:04:29,700
That is the definition of conspiracy.

831
01:04:29,701 --> 01:04:32,074
I pledged to ride north.

832
01:04:32,075 --> 01:04:33,908
I intend to honor that pledge.

833
01:04:33,909 --> 01:04:36,116
- And that will be treason.
- Treason?

834
01:04:36,117 --> 01:04:38,366
Disobeying your queen's command,
fighting with her enemies.

835
01:04:38,367 --> 01:04:39,701
What would you call it?

836
01:04:41,701 --> 01:04:43,576
Doesn't matter what I'd call it.

837
01:04:50,534 --> 01:04:53,284
I told you no one walks away from me.

838
01:04:55,618 --> 01:04:58,159
Are you going to order him to kill me?

839
01:05:00,284 --> 01:05:02,241
I'm the only one you have left.

840
01:05:02,242 --> 01:05:04,700
Our children are gone,
our father is gone.

841
01:05:04,701 --> 01:05:06,450
It's just me and you now.

842
01:05:06,451 --> 01:05:08,451
There's one more yet to come.

843
01:05:11,451 --> 01:05:13,451
Give the order, then.

844
01:05:32,826 --> 01:05:34,534
I don't believe you.

- Come in.

847
01:07:28,950 --> 01:07:30,408
Samwell Tarly.

848
01:07:30,409 --> 01:07:32,617
I wasn't sure if you'd remember me.

849
01:07:32,618 --> 01:07:34,451
I remember everything.

<font color="#80FF00">(DOOR CLOSES)</font>

851
01:07:42,618 --> 01:07:44,783
You helped us get beyond the Wall.

852
01:07:44,784 --> 01:07:47,325
- You're a good man.
- Oh, well, thank you,

853
01:07:47,326 --> 01:07:49,950
but, um, I'm not sure that I am.

854
01:07:54,117 --> 01:07:56,284
What happened to you beyond the Wall?

855
01:07:57,701 --> 01:07:59,284
I became the Three-Eyed Raven.

856
01:08:00,909 --> 01:08:01,992
Oh!

857
01:08:05,284 --> 01:08:07,658
I don't know what that means.

858
01:08:07,659 --> 01:08:10,408
I can see things that
happened in the past.

859
01:08:10,409 --> 01:08:14,491
I can see things happening now

860
01:08:14,492 --> 01:08:15,992
all over the world.

861
01:08:17,409 --> 01:08:19,826
Why did you come to Winterfell?

862
01:08:21,117 --> 01:08:22,492
Um...

863
01:08:24,701 --> 01:08:26,867
Jon's the one to lead the
fight against the dead.

864
01:08:26,868 --> 01:08:28,949
I know he is.

865
01:08:28,950 --> 01:08:30,908
But he can't do it alone,

866
01:08:30,909 --> 01:08:33,783
so I've come here to help him.

867
01:08:33,784 --> 01:08:36,658
He's on his way back to Winterfell

868
01:08:36,659 --> 01:08:38,284
with Daenerys Targaryen.

869
01:08:39,451 --> 01:08:42,491
You... you saw this in...

870
01:08:42,492 --> 01:08:44,159
in a vision?

871
01:08:47,159 --> 01:08:48,367
Oh.

872
01:08:51,159 --> 01:08:53,367
He needs to know the truth.

873
01:08:54,618 --> 01:08:55,908
The truth about what?

874
01:08:55,909 --> 01:08:57,700
About himself.

875
01:08:57,701 --> 01:09:01,241
No one knows. No one but me.

876
01:09:01,242 --> 01:09:04,199
Jon isn't really my father's son.

877
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:08,366
He's the son of Rhaegar Targaryen
and my aunt, Lyanna Stark.

878
01:09:08,367 --> 01:09:12,199
He was born in a tower in Dorne.

879
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:14,658
His last name isn't really Snow,

880
01:09:14,659 --> 01:09:15,659
it's Sand.

881
01:09:18,034 --> 01:09:19,034
It's not.

882
01:09:20,618 --> 01:09:23,033
Dornish bastards are named Sand.

883
01:09:23,034 --> 01:09:26,658
At the Citadel, I transcribed
a High Septon's diary.

884
01:09:26,659 --> 01:09:29,409
He annulled Rhaegar's marriage to Elia.

885
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:34,117
He wed Rhaegar and Lyanna
in a secret ceremony.

886
01:09:35,409 --> 01:09:36,867
Are you certain?

887
01:09:36,868 --> 01:09:39,575
It's what the High Septon
wrote in his private diary.

888
01:09:39,576 --> 01:09:41,409
I don't know why he'd lie.

889
01:09:43,242 --> 01:09:45,784
Is this something you can see?

890
01:09:47,242 --> 01:09:51,074
Rhaegar and Lyanna:
Father, Smith, Warrior,

891
01:09:51,075 --> 01:09:55,949
Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger.

892
01:09:55,950 --> 01:09:59,742
- I am hers and she is mine...
- I am his and he is mine...

893
01:09:59,743 --> 01:10:04,074
from this day until the end of my days.

895
01:10:09,326 --> 01:10:12,451
Rhaegar didn't kidnap
my aunt or rape her.

896
01:10:22,034 --> 01:10:23,576
He loved her.

897
01:10:31,326 --> 01:10:32,950
And she loved him.

His name is Aegon Targaryen.

901
01:11:12,492 --> 01:11:14,701
You have to protect him.

902
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:18,117

Are you all right?

910
01:12:24,409 --> 01:12:26,325
It's just strange.

911
01:12:26,326 --> 01:12:30,284
In his own horrible way,
I believe he loved me.

912
01:12:34,242 --> 01:12:35,783
You did the right thing.

913
01:12:35,784 --> 01:12:38,325
You did it.

914
01:12:38,326 --> 01:12:40,158
I'm just the executioner.

915
01:12:40,159 --> 01:12:41,909
You passed the sentence.

916
01:12:44,075 --> 01:12:46,908
You're the Lady of Winterfell.

917
01:12:46,909 --> 01:12:48,284
Does that bother you?

918
01:12:50,868 --> 01:12:53,743
I was never going to be
as good a lady as you.

919
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:56,701
So I had to be something else.

920
01:12:58,909 --> 01:13:01,658
I never could have survived
what you survived.

921
01:13:01,659 --> 01:13:03,991
You would have.

922
01:13:03,992 --> 01:13:05,992
You're the strongest person I know.

923
01:13:10,075 --> 01:13:12,618
I believe that's the nicest
thing you've ever said to me.

924
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:17,991
Well, don't get used to it.

925
01:13:17,992 --> 01:13:20,242
