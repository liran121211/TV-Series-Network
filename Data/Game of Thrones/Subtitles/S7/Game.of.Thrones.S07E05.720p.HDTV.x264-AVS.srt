2
00:02:21,017 --> 00:02:22,225
You could've killed me.

3
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:32,683
The fuck were you doing
back there?

4
00:02:32,684 --> 00:02:34,975
Ending the war.

5
00:02:34,976 --> 00:02:37,182
Killing her.

6
00:02:37,183 --> 00:02:39,600
You saw the dragon
between you and her?

7
00:02:42,726 --> 00:02:45,600
And?

8
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,182
Listen to me, cunt.

9
00:02:54,183 --> 00:02:55,725
Till I get what I'm owed,

10
00:02:55,726 --> 00:02:57,558
a dragon doesn't
get to kill you,

11
00:02:57,559 --> 00:02:59,433
you don't get to kill you,

12
00:02:59,434 --> 00:03:00,892
only I get to kill you.

13
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,891
That was only one of them.

14
00:03:06,892 --> 00:03:09,725
She has two more.

15
00:03:09,726 --> 00:03:12,808
If she decides to use them,
to really use them...

16
00:03:12,809 --> 00:03:15,433
- You're fucked.
- Don't you mean we're fucked?

17
00:03:15,434 --> 00:03:17,433
No, I do not.

18
00:03:17,434 --> 00:03:20,599
Dragons are where
our partnership ends.

19
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,224
I'm not gonna be around
when those things

20
00:03:22,225 --> 00:03:23,976
start spitting fire
on King's Landing.

21
00:03:26,017 --> 00:03:27,475
I have to tell Cersei.

22
00:03:30,308 --> 00:03:32,267
May as well jump
back in that river.

23
00:04:46,642 --> 00:04:49,599
I know what Cersei has told you.

24
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,349
That I've come
to destroy your cities,

25
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,599
burn down your homes,

26
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,350
murder you,
and orphan your children.

27
00:05:00,183 --> 00:05:03,975
That's Cersei Lannister, not me.

28
00:05:03,976 --> 00:05:06,182
I'm not here to murder,

29
00:05:06,183 --> 00:05:07,933
and all I want to destroy

30
00:05:07,934 --> 00:05:11,016
is the wheel that has
rolled over rich and poor

31
00:05:11,017 --> 00:05:15,225
to the benefit of no one but the
Cersei Lannisters of the world.

32
00:05:16,434 --> 00:05:18,683
I offer you a choice...

33
00:05:18,684 --> 00:05:21,016
bend the knee and join me.

34
00:05:21,017 --> 00:05:25,182
Together, we will leave the world
a better place than we found it.

35
00:05:25,183 --> 00:05:28,182
Or refuse...

36
00:05:28,183 --> 00:05:29,684
and die.

37
00:05:58,684 --> 00:06:00,225
Step forward, my lord.

38
00:06:09,392 --> 00:06:11,349
You will not kneel?

39
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,726
I already have a queen.

40
00:06:13,934 --> 00:06:15,433
My sister.

41
00:06:15,434 --> 00:06:16,641
She wasn't your queen

42
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:18,683
until recently, though, was she?

43
00:06:18,684 --> 00:06:21,016
When she murdered
your rightful queen

44
00:06:21,017 --> 00:06:23,641
and destroyed House Tyrell
for all time.

45
00:06:23,642 --> 00:06:26,934
So it appears your allegiances
are somewhat flexible.

46
00:06:28,058 --> 00:06:30,975
There are
no easy choices in war.

47
00:06:30,976 --> 00:06:33,349
Say what you will
about your sister,

48
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,850
she was born in Westeros.

49
00:06:35,851 --> 00:06:38,100
She's lived here all her life.

50
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,933
You, on the other hand,

51
00:06:42,934 --> 00:06:45,683
murdered your own father

52
00:06:45,684 --> 00:06:48,808
and chose to support
a foreign invader.

53
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:51,642
One with no ties to this land...

54
00:06:53,267 --> 00:06:55,642
with an army of savages
at her back.

55
00:06:57,475 --> 00:06:59,308
You will not trade
your honor for your life.

56
00:07:01,308 --> 00:07:02,766
I respect that.

57
00:07:02,767 --> 00:07:05,808
Perhaps he could take
the Black, Your Grace.

58
00:07:05,809 --> 00:07:08,224
Whatever else he is,
he is a true soldier.

59
00:07:08,225 --> 00:07:10,474
He'd be invaluable at the Wall.

60
00:07:10,475 --> 00:07:12,809
You cannot send me to the Wall.

61
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,809
You are not my queen.

62
00:07:29,267 --> 00:07:30,599
You will have to kill me, too.

63
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,475
Step back and shut your mouth.

64
00:07:34,017 --> 00:07:35,433
Who are you?

65
00:07:35,434 --> 00:07:36,684
A stupid boy.

66
00:07:37,809 --> 00:07:40,016
I am Dickon Tarly,

67
00:07:40,017 --> 00:07:41,433
son of Randyll Tarly.

68
00:07:41,434 --> 00:07:43,641
You are the future
of your house.

69
00:07:43,642 --> 00:07:47,016
This war has already wiped one
great house from the world.

70
00:07:47,017 --> 00:07:48,892
Don't let it happen again.
Bend the knee.

71
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,017
I will not.

72
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:06,057
Your Grace, nothing scrubs
bold notions from a man's head

73
00:08:06,058 --> 00:08:07,641
like a few weeks in a dark cell.

74
00:08:07,642 --> 00:08:10,307
I meant what I said.

75
00:08:10,308 --> 00:08:11,850
I'm not here
to put men in chains.

76
00:08:11,851 --> 00:08:14,182
If that becomes an option,
many will take it.

77
00:08:14,183 --> 00:08:15,559
I gave them a choice.

78
00:08:17,058 --> 00:08:18,391
They made it.

79
00:08:18,392 --> 00:08:21,558
Your Grace, if you start
beheading entire families...

80
00:08:21,559 --> 00:08:23,726
I'm not beheading anyone.

81
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,559
Your Grace.

82
00:08:54,892 --> 00:08:58,433
Lord Randyll
Tarly, Dickon Tarly,

83
00:08:58,434 --> 00:09:01,099
I, Daenerys of House
Targaryen, First of My Name,

84
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,224
Breaker of Chains,
and Mother of Dragons,

85
00:09:04,225 --> 00:09:06,058
sentence you to die.

86
00:09:09,642 --> 00:09:10,809
Dracarys.

87
00:09:58,809 --> 00:10:00,350
My... my lord...

88
00:10:10,267 --> 00:10:11,851
How many men did we lose?

89
00:10:14,434 --> 00:10:16,475
We haven't done
a full accounting.

90
00:10:18,183 --> 00:10:21,641
It's not only armies
that win wars.

91
00:10:21,642 --> 00:10:24,141
We have the Tyrell gold, we
have the Iron Bank behind us.

92
00:10:24,142 --> 00:10:25,809
We can buy mercenaries.

93
00:10:27,726 --> 00:10:29,599
Not the same as our men,
but they'll fight

94
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,808
if they're well paid,
which they will be.

95
00:10:31,809 --> 00:10:35,266
I just saw the Dothraki fight.

96
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:36,891
They'll beat any mercenary army.

97
00:10:36,892 --> 00:10:38,975
They'll beat any army
I've ever seen.

98
00:10:38,976 --> 00:10:41,850
Killing our men wasn't war
for them, it was sport.

99
00:10:41,851 --> 00:10:44,057
Her dragon burnt
a thousand wagons.

100
00:10:44,058 --> 00:10:46,307
Qyburn's scorpion fired
bolts bigger than you.

101
00:10:46,308 --> 00:10:48,851
They couldn't stop it.
And she has three of them.

102
00:10:50,892 --> 00:10:52,808
This isn't a war we can win.

103
00:10:52,809 --> 00:10:54,183
So, what do we do?

104
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,851
Sue for peace?

105
00:10:58,183 --> 00:10:59,766
I sit on her father's throne,

106
00:10:59,767 --> 00:11:02,433
the father you betrayed
and murdered.

107
00:11:02,434 --> 00:11:05,266
And in her mind, she's winning.

108
00:11:05,267 --> 00:11:07,350
What sort of offer
do you think she'd make?

109
00:11:09,809 --> 00:11:13,224
Maybe we can count on Tyrion
to intercede on our behalf

110
00:11:13,225 --> 00:11:15,600
by way of apology for
murdering our father and son.

111
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,850
He didn't.

112
00:11:18,851 --> 00:11:20,850
You saw the crossbow,
you saw his body.

113
00:11:20,851 --> 00:11:22,725
I'm not talking about Father.

114
00:11:22,726 --> 00:11:26,266
Tyrion didn't kill Joffrey.
He had nothing to do with it.

115
00:11:26,267 --> 00:11:29,559
- After all this time, it still amazes me that you...
- It was Olenna.

116
00:11:31,934 --> 00:11:34,267
She confessed before she died.

117
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:38,808
And this was before or after

118
00:11:38,809 --> 00:11:41,891
she drank the poison
you so kindly provided her?

119
00:11:41,892 --> 00:11:43,516
After.

120
00:11:43,517 --> 00:11:45,016
And you believed her?

121
00:11:45,017 --> 00:11:47,766
If you were Olenna,
would you rather have seen

122
00:11:47,767 --> 00:11:50,434
your granddaughter married
to Joffrey or Tommen?

123
00:11:52,809 --> 00:11:55,182
Which one would Margaery have
been better able to control?

124
00:11:55,183 --> 00:11:56,725
Which one would have made Olenna

125
00:11:56,726 --> 00:11:59,433
the true ruler
of the Seven Kingdoms?

126
00:11:59,434 --> 00:12:01,308
She was telling the truth.

127
00:12:08,684 --> 00:12:10,892
I shouldn't have
listened to you.

128
00:12:12,684 --> 00:12:14,474
She should have died screaming.

129
00:12:14,475 --> 00:12:15,766
She's dead, like her son,

130
00:12:15,767 --> 00:12:17,850
her grandchildren,
her whole house.

131
00:12:17,851 --> 00:12:21,433
And if we don't find a way out
of this war, we'll follow them.

132
00:12:21,434 --> 00:12:23,975
So we fight and die
or we submit and die.

133
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:26,141
I know my choice.

134
00:12:26,142 --> 00:12:28,642
A soldier should know his.

135
00:14:35,767 --> 00:14:37,933
They're beautiful, aren't they?

136
00:14:37,934 --> 00:14:40,726
It wasn't the word
I was thinking of, but...

137
00:14:41,976 --> 00:14:44,725
but, yes, they are.

138
00:14:44,726 --> 00:14:46,224
Gorgeous beasts.

139
00:14:46,225 --> 00:14:48,141
They're not beasts to me.

140
00:14:48,142 --> 00:14:49,975
No matter how big they get

141
00:14:49,976 --> 00:14:52,141
or how terrifying
to everyone else,

142
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:53,767
they're my children.

143
00:14:59,434 --> 00:15:00,766
You weren't gone long.

144
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:02,933
No.

145
00:15:02,934 --> 00:15:04,933
And?

146
00:15:04,934 --> 00:15:07,642
And I have fewer enemies
today than I did yesterday.

147
00:15:10,308 --> 00:15:12,391
You're not sure
how you feel about that.

148
00:15:12,392 --> 00:15:14,100
No, I'm not.

149
00:15:16,017 --> 00:15:17,474
How many men did your army kill

150
00:15:17,475 --> 00:15:19,475
taking Winterfell back
from the Boltons?

151
00:15:20,642 --> 00:15:22,016
Thousands.

152
00:15:22,017 --> 00:15:24,141
We both want to help people.

153
00:15:24,142 --> 00:15:27,850
We can only help them
from a position of strength.

154
00:15:27,851 --> 00:15:29,934
Sometimes strength is terrible.

155
00:15:33,142 --> 00:15:35,808
When you first came here,

156
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:39,558
Ser Davos said you took a knife
in the heart for your people.

157
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:41,183
Ser Davos gets carried away.

158
00:15:42,934 --> 00:15:44,641
So, it was a figure of speech?

159
00:15:49,142 --> 00:15:52,503
_

160
00:15:59,187 --> 00:16:00,606
_

161
00:16:05,183 --> 00:16:06,382
Your Grace.

162
00:16:12,225 --> 00:16:15,599
Jon Snow, this is
Ser Jorah Mormont,

163
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,850
an old friend.

164
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,349
I served with your father.

165
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,517
He was a great man.

166
00:16:23,058 --> 00:16:24,726
You look strong.

167
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:27,891
You found a cure?

168
00:16:27,892 --> 00:16:29,850
I wouldn't be here if I hadn't.

169
00:16:29,851 --> 00:16:34,349
I return to your
service, my queen,

170
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:36,141
if you'll have me.

171
00:16:36,142 --> 00:16:38,517
It would be my honor.

172
00:18:17,976 --> 00:18:19,433
Ravens.

173
00:18:19,434 --> 00:18:21,267
We need to send ravens.

174
00:18:23,726 --> 00:18:26,474
I put very little stock
in it myself.

175
00:18:26,475 --> 00:18:28,933
Prophecies of doom
are never in short supply,

176
00:18:28,934 --> 00:18:31,141
especially when winter comes.

177
00:18:31,142 --> 00:18:33,474
I remember Wolkan.

178
00:18:33,475 --> 00:18:35,850
A little timid,
but a sharp mind.

179
00:18:35,851 --> 00:18:39,349
Eh, the North has dulled
many good maesters' wits.

180
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,558
Hard to say whether
it's the cold, the drink,

181
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:43,349
or the company.

182
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,516
A crippled boy
claims to have seen

183
00:18:45,517 --> 00:18:47,641
dead men on the march
beyond the Wall,

184
00:18:47,642 --> 00:18:50,808
thanks to the magical help
of a raven with three eyes?

185
00:18:50,809 --> 00:18:52,474
Yes, it is a bit much.

186
00:18:52,475 --> 00:18:55,183
- Still, we ought to write back...
- Brandon Stark.

187
00:18:58,684 --> 00:19:01,851
- The crippled boy.
- Do you know him?

188
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:05,182
I led him through
the Wall years ago.

189
00:19:05,183 --> 00:19:08,349
I saw him go beyond the Wall.

190
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,933
And?

191
00:19:09,934 --> 00:19:12,850
Somehow, a crippled boy

192
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:14,933
survived for years beyond the
Wall when no one else could.

193
00:19:14,934 --> 00:19:18,684
Not the Night's Watch,
not the wildlings, no one.

194
00:19:20,308 --> 00:19:22,391
Perhaps we ought to listen
to what he has to say.

195
00:19:22,392 --> 00:19:25,516
Perhaps you need more scribing
work to discipline your mind.

196
00:19:25,517 --> 00:19:28,934
I sense a more detailed
proposal is forthcoming?

197
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:43,558
Everyone in Westeros
trusts and respects you.

198
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:47,725
If you tell people the threat
is real, they'll believe it.

199
00:19:47,726 --> 00:19:50,099
If you advise all the lords
to send their men north

200
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,057
to hold the Wall, they'll do it.

201
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:55,558
And if you tell every
maester in the Citadel

202
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:57,891
to search every word
of every faded scroll

203
00:19:57,892 --> 00:19:59,683
about the Long Night,

204
00:19:59,684 --> 00:20:01,516
they may find something
that lets us defeat

205
00:20:01,517 --> 00:20:03,434
the Army of the Dead for good.

206
00:20:08,517 --> 00:20:09,726
It could be done.

207
00:20:11,142 --> 00:20:13,933
And this news
could be authentic.

208
00:20:13,934 --> 00:20:15,600
It's possible.

209
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,433
It's also possible
that this message

210
00:20:20,434 --> 00:20:22,725
is part of a ploy
by the Dragon Queen

211
00:20:22,726 --> 00:20:25,683
to lure southern armies away from the
lands they are currently defending

212
00:20:25,684 --> 00:20:27,725
to open those lands
to easy conquest.

213
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,433
That does
seem far more likely

214
00:20:29,434 --> 00:20:31,391
than magic birds
talking to cripples.

215
00:20:31,392 --> 00:20:33,933
Archmaester, please.

216
00:20:33,934 --> 00:20:35,100
It's real.

217
00:20:37,017 --> 00:20:38,100
I've seen it.

218
00:20:40,934 --> 00:20:42,433
We will write to Maester Wolkan

219
00:20:42,434 --> 00:20:44,808
at Winterfell for clarification.

220
00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:47,683
I promise you we will get to the
truth of it one way or another.

221
00:20:47,684 --> 00:20:50,391
- Archmaester, please...
- That will be all, Tarly.

222
00:20:50,392 --> 00:20:52,891
It brings to mind the
work of Jenny of Oldstones,

223
00:20:52,892 --> 00:20:55,516
the charlatan who claimed descent
from the children of the forest.

224
00:20:55,517 --> 00:20:58,307
Don't forget the prophet Lodos,

225
00:20:58,308 --> 00:21:01,975
who promised that the Drowned God would
rise up and destroy Aegon the Conqueror.

226
00:21:01,976 --> 00:21:04,267
Ah, Lodos.

227
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:12,099
Is he the one whose father and
brother were just burnt alive?

228
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,057
I'm afraid so.

229
00:21:14,058 --> 00:21:15,307
Horrible business.

230
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:17,933
I haven't had the heart
to tell him yet.

231
00:21:17,934 --> 00:21:19,975
He's a good lad.

232
00:21:19,976 --> 00:21:21,725
Right.

233
00:21:21,726 --> 00:21:24,641
The ravenry was falling apart
the last time I checked.

234
00:21:29,851 --> 00:21:32,474
All rulers demand
that people bend the knee.

235
00:21:32,475 --> 00:21:33,684
That's why they're rulers.

236
00:21:36,809 --> 00:21:38,808
She gave Tarly a choice,

237
00:21:38,809 --> 00:21:41,641
a man who had taken up
arms against her.

238
00:21:41,642 --> 00:21:43,391
What else could she do?

239
00:21:43,392 --> 00:21:46,516
Not burn him alive
alongside his son?

240
00:21:46,517 --> 00:21:48,850
I am her Hand, not her head.

241
00:21:48,851 --> 00:21:51,099
I can't make
her decisions for her.

242
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:54,391
That's what I used to tell
myself about her father.

243
00:21:54,392 --> 00:21:58,766
I found the traitors, but I wasn't
the one burning them alive.

244
00:21:58,767 --> 00:22:01,517
I was only a purveyor
of information.

245
00:22:06,684 --> 00:22:10,725
It's what I told myself when I
watched them beg for mercy...

246
00:22:10,726 --> 00:22:13,307
I'm not the one doing it.

247
00:22:13,308 --> 00:22:15,766
When the pitch of their
screams rose higher...

248
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,808
I'm not the one doing it.

249
00:22:17,809 --> 00:22:19,391
When their hair caught fire

250
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:22,266
and the smell of their burning
flesh filled the throne room...

251
00:22:22,267 --> 00:22:23,892
I'm not the one doing it.

252
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,766
Daenerys is not her father.

253
00:22:34,767 --> 00:22:37,182
And she never will be

254
00:22:37,183 --> 00:22:39,225
with the right counsel.

255
00:22:42,475 --> 00:22:44,892
You need to find a way
to make her listen.

256
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:50,725
- Who's that for?
- Jon Snow.

257
00:22:50,726 --> 00:22:52,266
Did you read it?

258
00:22:52,267 --> 00:22:55,308
It's a sealed scroll
for the King in the North.

259
00:23:01,434 --> 00:23:02,892
What's it say?

260
00:23:03,976 --> 00:23:05,559
Nothing good.

261
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:15,433
I thought Arya was dead.

262
00:23:15,434 --> 00:23:18,516
I thought Bran was dead.

263
00:23:18,517 --> 00:23:19,934
I'm happy for you.

264
00:23:22,308 --> 00:23:23,725
You don't look happy.

265
00:23:23,726 --> 00:23:26,099
Bran saw the Night King
and his army

266
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,100
marching towards Eastwatch.

267
00:23:29,684 --> 00:23:31,683
If they make it past the Wall...

268
00:23:31,684 --> 00:23:34,391
The Wall has kept them out for
thousands of years, presumably.

269
00:23:34,392 --> 00:23:36,057
I need to go home.

270
00:23:36,058 --> 00:23:37,766
You said you don't
have enough men.

271
00:23:37,767 --> 00:23:40,349
We'll fight
with the men we have.

272
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,975
Unless you'll join us.

273
00:23:41,976 --> 00:23:44,141
And give the country to Cersei?

274
00:23:44,142 --> 00:23:47,975
As soon as I march away,
she marches in.

275
00:23:47,976 --> 00:23:50,307
Perhaps not.

276
00:23:50,308 --> 00:23:53,725
Cersei thinks the Army of the
Dead is nothing but a story

277
00:23:53,726 --> 00:23:56,975
made up by wet nurses
to frighten children.

278
00:23:56,976 --> 00:23:58,725
What if we prove her wrong?

279
00:23:58,726 --> 00:24:02,142
I don't think she'll come see
the dead at my invitation.

280
00:24:03,434 --> 00:24:05,475
So bring the dead to her.

281
00:24:06,934 --> 00:24:08,808
I thought that was what
we were trying to avoid.

282
00:24:08,809 --> 00:24:11,182
We don't have to
bring the whole army.

283
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:13,224
Only one soldier.

284
00:24:13,225 --> 00:24:15,142
Is that possible?

285
00:24:18,976 --> 00:24:20,683
The first wight I ever saw

286
00:24:20,684 --> 00:24:23,516
was brought into Castle
Black from beyond the Wall.

287
00:24:23,517 --> 00:24:25,850
Bring one of these things
down to King's Landing

288
00:24:25,851 --> 00:24:28,141
and show her the truth.

289
00:24:28,142 --> 00:24:30,182
Anything you bring back
will be useless

290
00:24:30,183 --> 00:24:32,016
unless Cersei
grants us an audience

291
00:24:32,017 --> 00:24:34,558
and is somehow convinced
not to murder us

292
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,808
the moment we set foot
in the capital.

293
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:40,391
The only person
she listens to is Jaime.

294
00:24:40,392 --> 00:24:42,225
He might listen to me.

295
00:24:46,225 --> 00:24:48,058
And how would you get
into King's Landing?

296
00:24:54,225 --> 00:24:56,057
I can smuggle you in,

297
00:24:56,058 --> 00:24:58,683
but if the gold cloaks
were to recognize you,

298
00:24:58,684 --> 00:25:01,891
I'm warning you,
I'm not a fighter.

299
00:25:01,892 --> 00:25:03,307
Well, it will all be for nothing

300
00:25:03,308 --> 00:25:05,099
if we don't have
one of these dead men.

301
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,474
Fair point.

302
00:25:06,475 --> 00:25:07,767
How do you propose to find one?

303
00:25:11,183 --> 00:25:14,392
With the queen's permission,
I'll go north and take one.

304
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,433
You asked me to find a
cure so I could serve you.

305
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:21,058
Allow me to serve you.

306
00:25:25,058 --> 00:25:26,558
The Free Folk will help us.

307
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,307
They know the real north
better than anyone.

308
00:25:29,308 --> 00:25:30,850
They won't follow Ser Jorah.

309
00:25:30,851 --> 00:25:32,058
They won't have to.

310
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,516
You can't lead a raid
beyond the Wall.

311
00:25:41,517 --> 00:25:44,141
You're not in the Night's Watch
anymore, you're King in the North.

312
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:46,725
I'm the only one here
who's fought them.

313
00:25:46,726 --> 00:25:49,100
I'm the only one here
who knows them.

314
00:25:50,475 --> 00:25:52,475
I haven't given you
permission to leave.

315
00:25:55,308 --> 00:25:58,683
With respect, Your Grace,
I don't need your permission.

316
00:25:58,684 --> 00:25:59,892
I am a king.

317
00:26:01,517 --> 00:26:02,933
And I came here

318
00:26:02,934 --> 00:26:04,766
knowing that you could
have your men behead me

319
00:26:04,767 --> 00:26:07,975
or your dragons burn me alive.

320
00:26:07,976 --> 00:26:12,391
I put my trust
in you, a stranger,

321
00:26:12,392 --> 00:26:15,391
because I knew it was the
best chance for my people,

322
00:26:15,392 --> 00:26:17,559
for all our people.

323
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:23,434
Now I'm asking you
to trust in a stranger...

324
00:26:25,142 --> 00:26:27,642
because it's our best chance.

325
00:26:45,642 --> 00:26:49,976
The King in the North
should stay in the North.

326
00:26:52,517 --> 00:26:56,891
We did not choose you
to rule us, my lady.

327
00:26:56,892 --> 00:26:59,726
But perhaps we should have.

328
00:27:02,225 --> 00:27:07,016
The Knights of the Vale came
here for you, Lady Stark.

329
00:27:07,017 --> 00:27:08,475
Aye.

330
00:27:12,934 --> 00:27:16,349
You are very kind, my lords.

331
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:18,391
But Jon is our king.

332
00:27:18,392 --> 00:27:20,933
He is doing what
he thinks is best.

333
00:27:30,851 --> 00:27:32,891
I warned Jon
this would happen.

334
00:27:32,892 --> 00:27:34,558
That he couldn't leave the North

335
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,391
and expect it to just sit
and wait for him like Ghost.

336
00:27:37,392 --> 00:27:39,766
He didn't. He trusted
you to hold it for him.

337
00:27:39,767 --> 00:27:42,559
Well, he's not making it easy.
The Northern lords are proud.

338
00:27:47,225 --> 00:27:49,516
These are Mother
and Father's chambers.

339
00:27:49,517 --> 00:27:51,058
And?

340
00:27:53,767 --> 00:27:56,099
Nothing.

341
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,891
Don't do that.

342
00:27:58,892 --> 00:28:01,392
- What?
- Say what you mean.

343
00:28:03,058 --> 00:28:05,517
You always liked nice things.

344
00:28:06,892 --> 00:28:09,225
They made you feel
better than everyone.

345
00:28:14,142 --> 00:28:15,725
Are you angry with me?

346
00:28:15,726 --> 00:28:18,057
They were insulting Jon,

347
00:28:18,058 --> 00:28:19,433
and you sat there and listened.

348
00:28:19,434 --> 00:28:20,933
I listened to their complaints,

349
00:28:20,934 --> 00:28:23,975
which is my responsibility
as Lady of Winterfell.

350
00:28:23,976 --> 00:28:26,933
Their opinions
are important to you.

351
00:28:26,934 --> 00:28:29,641
Glover has 500 men,
Royce has 2,000.

352
00:28:29,642 --> 00:28:32,599
Offend them
and Jon loses his army.

353
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,600
Not if they lose
their heads first.

354
00:28:38,058 --> 00:28:41,224
Winterfell didn't just
fall into our hands.

355
00:28:41,225 --> 00:28:43,099
We took it back,

356
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,057
and the Mormonts
and the Hornwoods

357
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:46,516
and the wildlings and the Vale.

358
00:28:46,517 --> 00:28:48,057
All of us, working together.

359
00:28:48,058 --> 00:28:52,391
Now, I'm sure cutting off
heads is very satisfying,

360
00:28:52,392 --> 00:28:55,934
but that's not the way you
get people to work together.

361
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,391
And if Jon doesn't come back,

362
00:29:01,392 --> 00:29:03,349
you'll need their support...

363
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,474
so you can work together

364
00:29:05,475 --> 00:29:07,433
to give you
what you really want.

365
00:29:07,434 --> 00:29:10,017
How can you even think
such a horrible thing?

366
00:29:12,726 --> 00:29:14,767
You're thinking it right now.

367
00:29:16,767 --> 00:29:19,725
You don't want to be,

368
00:29:19,726 --> 00:29:22,017
but the thought
just won't go away.

369
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:29,809
I have work to do.

370
00:29:33,475 --> 00:29:34,767
My lady.

371
00:29:46,809 --> 00:29:50,057
Last time I was here, I killed
my father with a crossbow.

372
00:29:50,058 --> 00:29:53,017
Last time I was here, you
killed my son with wildfire.

373
00:29:56,183 --> 00:29:59,016
There's a path to the left
that hugs the cliff.

374
00:29:59,017 --> 00:30:01,683
The guards
hardly ever patrol it.

375
00:30:01,684 --> 00:30:03,058
Too many steps.

376
00:30:07,934 --> 00:30:09,224
You're not staying here?

377
00:30:09,225 --> 00:30:12,725
I've got my own business
in Flea Bottom.

378
00:30:12,726 --> 00:30:14,558
What if someone takes the boat?

379
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,851
Then we're fucked.
Best hurry.

380
00:30:22,267 --> 00:30:23,683
We don't have time for this.

381
00:30:23,684 --> 00:30:25,850
We should be preparing
the city for a siege.

382
00:30:25,851 --> 00:30:27,016
The Dothraki are coming.

383
00:30:27,017 --> 00:30:29,141
All the more reason
for you to train.

384
00:30:29,142 --> 00:30:31,141
Unless you plan on fighting
Dothraki 12-year-olds.

385
00:30:31,142 --> 00:30:33,683
Well, I seem to recall them giving
you a bit of trouble as well.

386
00:30:33,684 --> 00:30:35,683
And here I am, ready to train.

387
00:30:35,684 --> 00:30:37,641
Why down here?

388
00:30:37,642 --> 00:30:39,474
I don't think
you want people to see

389
00:30:39,475 --> 00:30:42,391
how you look swinging
that thing yet.

390
00:30:42,392 --> 00:30:45,182
Today might be the day
I kill you by accident.

391
00:30:45,183 --> 00:30:47,726
Oh, you won't be
swinging it at me.

392
00:30:55,934 --> 00:30:57,600
I'll leave you to it.

393
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:02,726
I needed to see you.

394
00:31:04,183 --> 00:31:06,017
And I knew you'd
never agree to meet.

395
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:12,516
You made me look
like a complete fool.

396
00:31:12,517 --> 00:31:14,808
I thought I'd surprise you
by hitting Casterly Rock,

397
00:31:14,809 --> 00:31:17,766
but you were
three steps ahead of me.

398
00:31:17,767 --> 00:31:20,349
Abandoned the family home,
completely unsentimental.

399
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,850
Father would have been proud.

400
00:31:21,851 --> 00:31:23,599
- Don't talk about Father.
- Listen to me...

401
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,099
I once told Bronn

402
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,934
that if I ever saw you
again, I'd cut you in half.

403
00:31:30,934 --> 00:31:33,434
It'll take you a while
with a sparring sword.

404
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,516
He was going to execute me.

405
00:31:44,517 --> 00:31:47,224
He knew I was innocent.

406
00:31:47,225 --> 00:31:49,558
He didn't hate me
because of anything I did,

407
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:51,933
he hated me
because of what I am.

408
00:31:51,934 --> 00:31:55,100
A little monster
sent to punish him.

409
00:31:56,976 --> 00:31:59,182
Did he...
did he think...

410
00:31:59,183 --> 00:32:00,975
did he think I wanted
to be born this way?

411
00:32:00,976 --> 00:32:02,896
- Did he think I chose it...
- What do you want?!

412
00:32:09,392 --> 00:32:10,934
Daenerys will win this war.

413
00:32:13,308 --> 00:32:14,725
You're a military man.

414
00:32:14,726 --> 00:32:17,475
You must know there's
no way around that.

415
00:32:19,517 --> 00:32:21,099
Daenerys is not her father.

416
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,975
She's even willing
to suspend the hostilities

417
00:32:23,976 --> 00:32:26,475
if Cersei agrees
to certain terms.

418
00:32:27,642 --> 00:32:29,016
If you want Cersei
to bend the knee,

419
00:32:29,017 --> 00:32:30,474
you can ask her yourself.

420
00:32:30,475 --> 00:32:32,851
I... I don't.
And Daenerys doesn't.

421
00:32:34,267 --> 00:32:35,976
Not right now, anyway.

422
00:32:38,142 --> 00:32:40,392
She has a more
important request.

423
00:33:19,892 --> 00:33:22,100
I wasn't sure I'd find you.

424
00:33:29,392 --> 00:33:31,391
Thought you might
still be rowing.

425
00:33:35,017 --> 00:33:38,099
I looked in shops,
taverns, brothels.

426
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:41,391
Should have known to come
straight to the Street of Steel.

427
00:33:41,392 --> 00:33:43,891
Aren't you worried
about the gold cloaks?

428
00:33:43,892 --> 00:33:45,307
Haven't been here in years.

429
00:33:45,308 --> 00:33:47,725
Why should they recognize me?

430
00:33:47,726 --> 00:33:50,392
Sometimes I hardly do.

431
00:33:52,058 --> 00:33:54,225
Nothing fucks you
harder than time.

432
00:33:59,017 --> 00:34:01,099
Anybody give you any trouble?

433
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,558
Here I am, arming Lannisters,

434
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:05,433
and I never get a second look.

435
00:34:05,434 --> 00:34:06,933
But you were right.

436
00:34:06,934 --> 00:34:09,474
Safest place for me was
right under the queen's nose.

437
00:34:09,475 --> 00:34:10,975
Don't be so sure.

438
00:34:10,976 --> 00:34:13,892
Safety is never a permanent
state of affairs.

439
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,642
Bad things are coming.

440
00:34:20,142 --> 00:34:23,363
You came to get me.
You want me to come with you.

441
00:34:23,483 --> 00:34:24,618
Well, the thing you need to
understand is...

442
00:34:24,642 --> 00:34:25,212
I'm ready.

443
00:34:25,332 --> 00:34:26,683
- You...
- Let's go.

444
00:34:26,684 --> 00:34:28,599
You should know
what you're heading into.

445
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,599
What do you think
I've been thinking about

446
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,975
with every swing of the hammer?

447
00:34:31,976 --> 00:34:34,433
How happy I am making weapons

448
00:34:34,434 --> 00:34:36,891
for the family
that killed my father?

449
00:34:36,892 --> 00:34:38,599
The family that
tried to kill me?

450
00:34:40,726 --> 00:34:42,975
I've been getting ready.

451
00:34:42,976 --> 00:34:44,433
I never knew what for,

452
00:34:44,434 --> 00:34:46,976
but I've always known
I'd know it when it comes.

453
00:34:48,642 --> 00:34:51,725
You might want to bring
one of those swords.

454
00:34:51,726 --> 00:34:53,642
I don't know much
about swinging swords.

455
00:34:55,142 --> 00:34:56,475
But this...

456
00:34:58,308 --> 00:34:59,642
this I know.

457
00:35:08,726 --> 00:35:10,141
Keep your father's name
to yourself.

458
00:35:10,142 --> 00:35:12,934
Situation's complicated
enough already.

459
00:35:14,308 --> 00:35:15,976
Well, who should I say I am?

460
00:35:19,809 --> 00:35:22,224
I told you, Clovis, if we
don't get out of here soon,

461
00:35:22,225 --> 00:35:24,105
- someone's going to...
- You there!

462
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:28,684
No weapons, friends.
I promise.

463
00:35:29,892 --> 00:35:31,349
What can I do for you?

464
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:33,850
- Is that your boat?
- It is.

465
00:35:33,851 --> 00:35:36,266
- The docks are that way.
- That they are.

466
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:37,766
I try to stay away from them

467
00:35:37,767 --> 00:35:40,017
to avoid good men
such as yourselves.

468
00:35:42,642 --> 00:35:46,016
- Still five gold dragons?
- Are you joking?

469
00:35:46,017 --> 00:35:48,266
You must be even older
than you look.

470
00:35:48,267 --> 00:35:50,182
- 15.
- 15?!

471
00:35:50,183 --> 00:35:51,308
Apiece.

472
00:35:59,726 --> 00:36:01,851
I can't say it was a pleasure
doing business with you.

473
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:05,726
What's in the boat?

474
00:36:11,267 --> 00:36:12,433
Not more gold.

475
00:36:12,434 --> 00:36:14,182
- Wine?
- Mm.

476
00:36:14,183 --> 00:36:16,183
- I like wine.
- Or hams.

477
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,225
Come have a look.

478
00:36:27,767 --> 00:36:29,683
- Fermented crab.
- What?

479
00:36:29,684 --> 00:36:31,558
Fermented crab.

480
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:34,558
One bucket of this triples a
brothel's earnings for the week.

481
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:36,516
A man thinks he's done.

482
00:36:36,517 --> 00:36:39,099
He's ready to go back
to his loving family.

483
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,016
But before he gets
his breeches up,

484
00:36:41,017 --> 00:36:44,391
his lady of the hour pops a tiny
spoon of that into his mouth.

485
00:36:44,392 --> 00:36:47,933
Five minutes later,
he's back in the race.

486
00:36:47,934 --> 00:36:50,434
Here, have a taste.

487
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,975
I'd hurry to your
favorite establishment,

488
00:37:04,976 --> 00:37:07,474
or you'll put a hole
in that chainmail.

489
00:37:34,475 --> 00:37:36,475
Oi, dwarf!

490
00:37:37,809 --> 00:37:39,349
I really wouldn't try any more

491
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:41,391
until you see how
the first bite hits you.

492
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:43,266
That dwarf...

493
00:37:43,267 --> 00:37:44,891
Where'd you get that scar?

494
00:37:44,892 --> 00:37:47,433
Fish hook. Some men
you just can't teach.

495
00:37:47,434 --> 00:37:50,516
We was looking for a dwarf with
a scar like that a while back.

496
00:37:50,517 --> 00:37:52,558
Perhaps there's
some arrangement?

497
00:37:54,976 --> 00:37:56,933
Arrangement?

498
00:37:56,934 --> 00:38:00,141
You gonna arrange to pay us
more than Queen Cersei...

499
00:38:07,976 --> 00:38:09,683
This is Gendry.

500
00:38:09,684 --> 00:38:11,183
He'll do.

501
00:38:13,892 --> 00:38:14,892
Go, go, go.

502
00:38:17,684 --> 00:38:19,182
I could give you something.

503
00:38:19,183 --> 00:38:20,684
That won't be necessary.

504
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:30,350
Ser Jaime.

505
00:38:33,183 --> 00:38:35,851
Why was Qyburn here?

506
00:38:37,267 --> 00:38:39,517
He's the Hand of the Queen.
Why are you here?

507
00:38:44,183 --> 00:38:46,726
I met with Tyrion.

508
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,350
What did our brother
have to say?

509
00:38:59,934 --> 00:39:02,391
Daenerys wants to meet.

510
00:39:02,392 --> 00:39:05,016
To discuss her surrender?

511
00:39:05,017 --> 00:39:06,850
To discuss an armistice.

512
00:39:06,851 --> 00:39:09,641
She's just won a great victory.
Why would she want a truce now?

513
00:39:09,642 --> 00:39:11,391
Because an army of dead men

514
00:39:11,392 --> 00:39:13,934
is marching
on the Seven Kingdoms.

515
00:39:16,434 --> 00:39:18,266
Tyrion claims he'll have proof.

516
00:39:22,142 --> 00:39:24,516
- Are you going to punish him?
- Tyrion?

517
00:39:24,517 --> 00:39:26,017
Bronn.

518
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:30,933
He betrayed you.

519
00:39:30,934 --> 00:39:33,308
He set up a meeting without
your knowledge or consent.

520
00:39:37,142 --> 00:39:38,433
Do you think
anything of importance

521
00:39:38,434 --> 00:39:40,933
happens in this city
without me knowing?

522
00:39:40,934 --> 00:39:44,182
You let it happen.
Why?

523
00:39:44,183 --> 00:39:46,850
I've come to believe that

524
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:49,558
an accommodation
with the Dragon Queen

525
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:52,099
could be in our
immediate interest.

526
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:55,433
She has the numbers. If we want to
beat her, we have to be clever.

527
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:57,600
We have to fight her
like Father would have.

528
00:40:01,058 --> 00:40:04,225
Dead men, dragons,
and Dragon Queens...

529
00:40:06,267 --> 00:40:09,266
Whatever stands in our way,

530
00:40:09,267 --> 00:40:11,016
we will defeat it.

531
00:40:11,017 --> 00:40:13,808
For ourselves, for our house,

532
00:40:13,809 --> 00:40:15,809
for this.

533
00:40:28,434 --> 00:40:30,016
Who will you say is the father?

534
00:40:30,017 --> 00:40:31,308
You.

535
00:40:37,225 --> 00:40:38,475
People won't like that.

536
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:46,516
Do you remember what Father
used to say about people?

537
00:40:46,517 --> 00:40:50,475
The lion does not concern himself
with the opinions of the sheep.

538
00:41:04,392 --> 00:41:06,350
Never betray me again.

539
00:41:11,434 --> 00:41:13,349
We're leaving today.

540
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:16,933
- The king's got a lot on his mind.
- I understand.

541
00:41:16,934 --> 00:41:19,516
He doesn't need to be thinking about
harboring the bastard of a dead king.

542
00:41:19,517 --> 00:41:21,975
- You don't have to worry.
- You're just Clovis,

543
00:41:21,976 --> 00:41:24,307
a smith who's come
to pay his respects

544
00:41:24,308 --> 00:41:27,307
before he heads off to work
at the Winterfell forges.

545
00:41:27,308 --> 00:41:29,307
Understood.

546
00:41:30,767 --> 00:41:32,933
Begging your pardon, Your Grace.

547
00:41:32,934 --> 00:41:34,391
You survived King's Landing.

548
00:41:34,392 --> 00:41:37,391
Yet again. Your
Grace, this is Clo...

549
00:41:37,392 --> 00:41:39,808
Name's Gendry, Your Grace.

550
00:41:39,809 --> 00:41:41,391
I'm Robert Baratheon's son.

551
00:41:41,392 --> 00:41:42,517
Bastard son.

552
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,057
He was meant
to keep that to himself.

553
00:41:48,058 --> 00:41:49,891
Our fathers trusted each other.

554
00:41:49,892 --> 00:41:51,225
Why shouldn't we?

555
00:41:53,517 --> 00:41:56,016
I saw your father once
at Winterfell.

556
00:41:56,017 --> 00:41:59,225
I met yours in my shop.

557
00:42:00,934 --> 00:42:03,267
- You're a lot leaner.
- And you're a lot shorter.

558
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:17,141
I grew up on stories about them.

559
00:42:17,142 --> 00:42:20,142
All I ever knew is that
they fought together and won.

560
00:42:21,892 --> 00:42:24,683
Ser Davos told me where you're
going, Your Grace, and why.

561
00:42:24,684 --> 00:42:26,474
Let me come with you.

562
00:42:26,475 --> 00:42:28,349
Don't be a fool.
You're not a soldier.

563
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:30,182
No, but I'm a fighter.

564
00:42:30,183 --> 00:42:33,267
And he won't be needing a
smith with a sword like that.

565
00:42:35,684 --> 00:42:37,182
You know how to use one?

566
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:39,558
Well, that's a problem.

567
00:42:39,559 --> 00:42:41,100
I prefer a hammer.

568
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,809
He can handle himself.

569
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,683
We could use the help.

570
00:42:49,684 --> 00:42:51,558
As my father used to say,

571
00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:53,641
"It's better to be
a coward for a minute,

572
00:42:53,642 --> 00:42:55,891
than dead for
the rest of your life."

573
00:42:55,892 --> 00:42:58,307
I owe you my life.

574
00:42:58,308 --> 00:43:00,099
Twice over.

575
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:03,349
But if what you said is true
about what's up there,

576
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:05,809
I can't wait out this war.

577
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,516
Yeah, nobody mind me.

578
00:43:11,517 --> 00:43:15,558
All I've ever done
is live to a ripe old age.

579
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:17,474
All right, come on.

580
00:43:27,058 --> 00:43:29,307
You may not believe it,

581
00:43:29,308 --> 00:43:32,016
but I've missed you, Mormont.

582
00:43:32,017 --> 00:43:35,141
Nobody glowers quite like you.

583
00:43:35,142 --> 00:43:36,434
Not even Grey Worm.

584
00:43:42,225 --> 00:43:44,182
This is the coin
the slaver gave me

585
00:43:44,183 --> 00:43:47,182
when I suggested he free us
and pay us, remember?

586
00:43:47,183 --> 00:43:51,017
It was supposed to last us
the rest of our lives.

587
00:43:55,475 --> 00:43:56,851
Take it with you.

588
00:43:59,517 --> 00:44:01,016
But bring it back.

589
00:44:01,017 --> 00:44:02,183
Our queen needs you.

590
00:44:11,559 --> 00:44:14,017
We should be better
at saying farewell by now.

591
00:44:15,684 --> 00:44:17,183
Your Grace, I...

592
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,850
If I don't return, at least
you won't have to deal

593
00:44:36,851 --> 00:44:38,211
with the King
in the North anymore.

594
00:44:40,517 --> 00:44:42,392
I've grown used to him.

595
00:44:44,475 --> 00:44:47,100
I wish you good fortune in the
wars to come, Your Grace.

596
00:44:56,183 --> 00:44:57,851
Heave!

597
00:45:20,976 --> 00:45:25,433
Do you know how many
steps there are in the Citadel?

598
00:45:25,434 --> 00:45:26,641
No.

599
00:45:26,642 --> 00:45:29,600
15,782.

600
00:45:34,183 --> 00:45:37,600
Guess how many windows are
in the Great Sept of Baelor.

601
00:45:39,726 --> 00:45:42,266
None anymore.

602
00:45:42,267 --> 00:45:43,933
That's true.

603
00:45:43,934 --> 00:45:48,266
This High Septon Maynard,
he recorded everything.

604
00:45:48,267 --> 00:45:50,475
He even recorded
his own bowel movements.

605
00:45:54,017 --> 00:45:57,224
What does "annulment" mean?

606
00:45:57,225 --> 00:46:01,099
It's when a man
sets aside his lawful wife.

607
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:06,474
Maynard says here that he issued
an annulment for a Prince "Ragger"

608
00:46:06,475 --> 00:46:09,975
and remarried him to someone
else at the same time

609
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:12,516
in a secret ceremony in Dorne.

610
00:46:12,517 --> 00:46:14,433
Is that a common thing
in the south or...?

611
00:46:14,434 --> 00:46:15,809
These maesters...

612
00:46:17,684 --> 00:46:21,266
they set me to the task of preserving
that man's window counting

613
00:46:21,267 --> 00:46:23,558
and annulments and bowel
movements for all eternity,

614
00:46:23,559 --> 00:46:25,349
while the secret to
defeating the Night King's

615
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:28,016
probably sitting on some dusty shelf
somewhere, completely ignored.

616
00:46:28,017 --> 00:46:29,933
But that's all right, isn't it?

617
00:46:29,934 --> 00:46:34,016
We can all become slavering, murderous
imbeciles in thrall to evil incarnate

618
00:46:34,017 --> 00:46:35,641
as long as we can have access
to the full records

619
00:46:35,642 --> 00:46:39,684
of High Septon Maynard's
15,782 shits!

620
00:46:42,017 --> 00:46:43,642
Steps.

621
00:46:46,684 --> 00:46:48,809
That number was the steps.

622
00:48:10,767 --> 00:48:13,349
Are you sure
you want to do this?

623
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:15,767
You always wanted
to be a maester.

624
00:48:17,392 --> 00:48:21,559
I'm tired of reading about
the achievements of better men.

625
00:49:50,642 --> 00:49:52,517
I found it, my lord.

626
00:49:56,225 --> 00:49:57,933
It, uh, took some searching.

627
00:49:57,934 --> 00:50:00,017
Maester Luwin's archives
are very thorough.

628
00:50:04,726 --> 00:50:07,349
You're sure this is the
only copy in Winterfell?

629
00:50:07,350 --> 00:50:09,225
Uh, yes, my lord.

630
00:50:14,017 --> 00:50:15,934
Lady Stark thanks you
for your service.

631
00:52:48,058 --> 00:52:49,933
Isn't it your
job to talk him out

632
00:52:49,934 --> 00:52:51,933
of stupid fucking
ideas like this?

633
00:52:51,934 --> 00:52:54,726
I've been failing
at that job of late.

634
00:52:56,350 --> 00:52:58,391
How many queens are there now?

635
00:52:58,392 --> 00:52:59,725
Two.

636
00:52:59,726 --> 00:53:02,891
And you need to convince
the one with the dragons

637
00:53:02,892 --> 00:53:04,725
or the one who
fucks her brother?

638
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:07,559
Both.

639
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:09,600
How many men did you bring?

640
00:53:12,684 --> 00:53:14,224
Not enough.

641
00:53:14,225 --> 00:53:15,851
The big woman?

642
00:53:19,183 --> 00:53:21,975
We were hoping some of
your men could help.

643
00:53:21,976 --> 00:53:24,808
- Hmm.
- I'll be staying behind.

644
00:53:24,809 --> 00:53:27,933
I'm a liability out there,
as you well know.

645
00:53:27,934 --> 00:53:28,934
You are.

646
00:53:31,726 --> 00:53:34,934
You really want to go out there?
Again?

647
00:53:41,225 --> 00:53:42,976
You're not the only ones.

648
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:50,099
My scouts found them
a mile south of the Wall.

649
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:51,976
Said they were
on their way here.

650
00:53:58,809 --> 00:54:00,267
You're the Hound.

651
00:54:02,267 --> 00:54:04,100
I saw you once at Winterfell.

652
00:54:09,809 --> 00:54:11,975
They want to go
beyond the Wall, too.

653
00:54:11,976 --> 00:54:15,266
We don't want to go beyond
the Wall, we have to.

654
00:54:15,267 --> 00:54:17,433
Our Lord told us that
the Great War is coming...

655
00:54:17,434 --> 00:54:19,641
Don't trust him.

656
00:54:19,642 --> 00:54:21,600
Don't trust any of them.

657
00:54:27,225 --> 00:54:28,850
They're the Brotherhood.

658
00:54:28,851 --> 00:54:31,433
And the last thing
their lord told them to do

659
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:33,808
was sell me to a red witch
to be murdered.

660
00:54:33,809 --> 00:54:35,517
Thoros?

661
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:42,641
I hardly recognized you.

662
00:54:42,642 --> 00:54:44,850
Ser Jorah Mormont.

663
00:54:44,851 --> 00:54:47,808
They won't give me anything
to drink down here.

664
00:54:47,809 --> 00:54:50,850
I haven't been feeling
like myself.

665
00:54:50,851 --> 00:54:53,683
You're a fucking Mormont?

666
00:54:53,684 --> 00:54:55,808
Like the last Lord Commander?

667
00:54:55,809 --> 00:54:58,016
He was my father.

668
00:54:58,017 --> 00:55:01,016
He hunted us like animals.

669
00:55:01,017 --> 00:55:04,057
You returned the favor,
as I recall.

670
00:55:05,726 --> 00:55:08,349
Here we all are

671
00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:09,933
at the edge of the world

672
00:55:09,934 --> 00:55:11,516
at the same moment,

673
00:55:11,517 --> 00:55:14,017
heading in the same direction
for the same reason.

674
00:55:15,851 --> 00:55:18,099
Our reasons aren't your reasons.

675
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:20,475
It doesn't matter
what we think our reasons are.

676
00:55:22,684 --> 00:55:24,474
There's a greater
purpose at work.

677
00:55:24,475 --> 00:55:27,766
And we serve it together,

678
00:55:27,767 --> 00:55:30,057
whether we know it or not.

679
00:55:30,058 --> 00:55:32,975
We may take the steps,
but the Lord of Light...

680
00:55:32,976 --> 00:55:36,349
For fuck's sake,
will you shut your hole?

681
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:39,141
Are we coming with you or not?

682
00:55:39,142 --> 00:55:41,349
Don't you want to know
what we're doing?

683
00:55:41,350 --> 00:55:45,766
Is it worse than sitting in a
freezing cell, waiting to die?

684
00:55:45,767 --> 00:55:47,766
He's right.

685
00:55:47,767 --> 00:55:49,767
We're all on the same side.

686
00:55:52,267 --> 00:55:53,392
How can we be?

687
00:55:55,017 --> 00:55:57,100
We're all breathing.
