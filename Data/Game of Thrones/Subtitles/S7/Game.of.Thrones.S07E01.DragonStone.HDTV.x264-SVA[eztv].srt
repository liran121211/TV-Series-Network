Stop trying.

177
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:24,745
All right, I'll stop
trying to protect you

178
00:15:24,746 --> 00:15:26,119
and you stop trying
to undermine me.

179
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,329
I'm not trying to undermine you!

180
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:32,911
You have to be
smarter than Father.

181
00:15:32,912 --> 00:15:35,578
You need to be
smarter than Robb.

182
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:38,703
I loved them, I miss them,
but they made stupid mistakes,

183
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:40,745
and they both
lost their heads for it.

184
00:15:40,746 --> 00:15:42,953
And how should I be smarter?

185
00:15:42,954 --> 00:15:44,412
By listening to you?

186
00:15:46,538 --> 00:15:49,745
Would that be so terrible?

187
00:15:49,746 --> 00:15:52,704
A raven from King's Landing, Your Grace.

188
00:16:01,704 --> 00:16:04,745
"Cersei of House Lannister,
First of Her Name,

189
00:16:04,746 --> 00:16:06,662
Queen of the Andals
and the First Men,

190
00:16:06,663 --> 00:16:08,286
Protector of
the Seven Kingdoms..."

191
00:16:08,287 --> 00:16:09,746
What does she want?

192
00:16:10,995 --> 00:16:13,787
(SIGHS)
Come to King's Landing.

193
00:16:13,788 --> 00:16:17,620
Bend the knee or suffer
the fate of all traitors.

194
00:16:17,621 --> 00:16:19,745
You've been so consumed
with the enemy to the north,

195
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:21,578
you've forgotten about
the one to the south.

196
00:16:21,579 --> 00:16:24,620
I'm consumed with the Night
King because I've seen him.

197
00:16:24,621 --> 00:16:27,245
And believe me, you'd think
of little else if you had, too.

198
00:16:27,246 --> 00:16:28,953
We still have a wall between
us and the Night King.

199
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:30,787
There's nothing
between us and Cersei.

200
00:16:30,788 --> 00:16:33,703
There's a thousand miles
between us and Cersei.

201
00:16:33,704 --> 00:16:36,495
Winter is here. The Lannisters
are a southern army.

202
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:37,953
They've never ranged
this far north.

203
00:16:37,954 --> 00:16:41,286
You're the military man,
but I know her.

204
00:16:41,287 --> 00:16:44,620
If you're her enemy, she'll never
stop until she's destroyed you.

205
00:16:44,621 --> 00:16:47,788
Everyone who's ever crossed her,
she's found a way to murder.

206
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,954
You almost sound
as if you admire her.

207
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:58,788
I learned a great deal from her.

208
00:17:35,663 --> 00:17:37,495
What is this?

209
00:17:37,496 --> 00:17:40,161
It's what we've been
waiting for our whole lives.

210
00:17:40,162 --> 00:17:42,953
It's what Father trained us for,
whether he knew it or not.

211
00:17:42,954 --> 00:17:44,453
He knew it.

212
00:17:44,454 --> 00:17:46,411
Made me memorize
every damn city, town,

213
00:17:46,412 --> 00:17:47,994
lake, forest, and mountain.

214
00:17:47,995 --> 00:17:50,162
It's ours now.
We just have to take it.

215
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:54,036
You've been quiet
since you came home.

216
00:17:54,037 --> 00:17:55,495
Are you angry with me?

217
00:17:55,496 --> 00:17:57,746
No, not angry.

218
00:17:58,870 --> 00:17:59,870
Are you afraid of me?

219
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:02,995
Should I be?

220
00:18:06,788 --> 00:18:10,703
Daenerys Targaryen has chosen
Tyrion to be her Hand.

221
00:18:10,704 --> 00:18:13,495
Right now, they're sailing
across the Narrow Sea,

222
00:18:13,496 --> 00:18:16,495
hoping to take back
her father's throne.

223
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:18,911
Our little brother,

224
00:18:18,912 --> 00:18:21,078
the one you love so much,

225
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:22,911
the one you set free,

226
00:18:22,912 --> 00:18:26,203
the one who murdered our
father and our first-born son,

227
00:18:26,204 --> 00:18:29,538
now he stands beside our enemies
and gives them counsel.

228
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:37,245
He's out there somewhere
at the head of an armada.

229
00:18:37,246 --> 00:18:38,954
Where will they land?

230
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:43,078
Dragonstone.

231
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:45,869
They have deep-water
ports for the ships.

232
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,869
Stannis left
the castle unoccupied,

233
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,328
and that's where she was born.

234
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:51,620
Enemies to the east.

235
00:18:51,621 --> 00:18:53,411
Enemies to the south...

236
00:18:53,412 --> 00:18:56,411
Ellaria Sand
and her brood of bitches.

237
00:18:56,412 --> 00:18:58,245
Enemies to the west...

238
00:18:58,246 --> 00:19:00,078
Olenna, the old cunt.

239
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:03,286
Another traitor.

240
00:19:03,287 --> 00:19:05,453
Enemies to the north.

241
00:19:05,454 --> 00:19:08,578
Ned Stark's bastard has been
named King in the North

242
00:19:08,579 --> 00:19:11,578
and that murdering whore
Sansa stands beside him.

243
00:19:11,579 --> 00:19:14,245
Enemies everywhere.
We're surrounded by traitors.

244
00:19:14,246 --> 00:19:15,953
You're in command
of the Lannister army now.

245
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:19,078
- How do we proceed?
- Winter is here.

246
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:22,370
We can't win a war if we can't
feed our men and our horses.

247
00:19:22,371 --> 00:19:26,537
The Tyrells have the grain,
the Tyrells have the livestock.

248
00:19:26,538 --> 00:19:28,578
Will the Tyrell bannermen
stand alongside

249
00:19:28,579 --> 00:19:31,869
a Dothraki horde
and Unsullied slave soldiers?

250
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,537
If they think Daenerys will win.

251
00:19:34,538 --> 00:19:36,495
No one wants to fight
on the losing side.

252
00:19:36,496 --> 00:19:39,621
Right now, we look like the losing side.

253
00:19:40,912 --> 00:19:42,745
I'm the Queen
of the Seven Kingdoms.

254
00:19:42,746 --> 00:19:45,495
Three kingdoms, at best.

255
00:19:45,496 --> 00:19:48,036
I'm not sure you understand
how much danger we're in.

256
00:19:48,037 --> 00:19:49,828
I understand we're
in a war for survival.

257
00:19:49,829 --> 00:19:52,869
I understand whoever loses dies.

258
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:55,161
I understand whoever wins
could launch a dynasty

259
00:19:55,162 --> 00:19:56,745
that lasts a thousand years.

260
00:19:56,746 --> 00:19:59,328
A dynasty for whom?

261
00:19:59,329 --> 00:20:02,328
Our children are dead.

262
00:20:02,329 --> 00:20:03,787
We're the last of us.

263
00:20:03,788 --> 00:20:05,829
A dynasty for us, then.

264
00:20:08,995 --> 00:20:10,538
We never talked about Tommen.

265
00:20:13,538 --> 00:20:15,495
There's nothing to say.

266
00:20:15,496 --> 00:20:17,453
Our baby boy killed himself.

267
00:20:17,454 --> 00:20:18,994
He betrayed me.

268
00:20:18,995 --> 00:20:20,495
He betrayed us both.

269
00:20:20,496 --> 00:20:22,328
Should we spend our days
mourning the dead...

270
00:20:22,329 --> 00:20:23,745
Mother, father,
and all our children?

271
00:20:23,746 --> 00:20:26,328
- Cersei...
- I loved them. I did.

272
00:20:26,329 --> 00:20:29,537
But they're ashes now and
we're still flesh and blood.

273
00:20:29,538 --> 00:20:32,538
We're the last Lannisters,
the last ones who count.

274
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:41,036
Even Lannisters can't
survive without allies.

275
00:20:41,037 --> 00:20:44,203
Where are our allies now?

276
00:20:44,204 --> 00:20:46,411
You saw what happened to
Walder Frey and his family.

277
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:48,078
I heard.

278
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:50,620
- How could we ever trust a man like that?
- We couldn't.

279
00:20:50,621 --> 00:20:52,620
He was a useless, old coward,

280
00:20:52,621 --> 00:20:54,453
but the Freys supported us.

281
00:20:54,454 --> 00:20:55,828
Now they're all dead.

282
00:20:55,829 --> 00:20:57,537
Whoever killed them
is no friend of ours.

283
00:20:57,538 --> 00:20:59,078
We need allies.

284
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:00,869
Stronger, better allies.

285
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,995
We can't win this war alone.

286
00:21:04,995 --> 00:21:08,621
You think I listened to Father for
40 years and learned nothing?

287
00:21:13,496 --> 00:21:16,037
(SEAGULLS SCREECHING)

288
00:21:45,621 --> 00:21:47,119
Jaime:
The Greyjoys?

289
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,703
You invited the Greyjoys
to King's Landing?

290
00:21:49,704 --> 00:21:52,537
- Not all of them.
- Well, it looks like all of them.

291
00:21:52,538 --> 00:21:54,119
I invited Euron Greyjoy,

292
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,620
the new King
of the Iron Islands.

293
00:21:56,621 --> 00:21:59,328
You said yourself we needed
stronger, better allies.

294
00:21:59,329 --> 00:22:02,453
- There you are.
- How are they better allies?

295
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:04,869
How are they different
from the Freys?

296
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:06,453
They both broke their promises

297
00:22:06,454 --> 00:22:08,745
and murdered their former friends
as soon as it suited them.

298
00:22:08,746 --> 00:22:11,745
So does everyone
when it suits them.

299
00:22:11,746 --> 00:22:14,370
Unlike the Freys,
they have ships.

300
00:22:14,371 --> 00:22:16,994
- And they're good at killing.
- They're not good at anything.

301
00:22:16,995 --> 00:22:20,411
I know the ironborn. They're
bitter, angry little people.

302
00:22:20,412 --> 00:22:23,620
All they know how to do is steal things
they can't build or grow themselves.

303
00:22:23,621 --> 00:22:25,745
Euron Greyjoy didn't
come here for that.

304
00:22:25,746 --> 00:22:27,787
Oh, what did
he come here for, then?

305
00:22:27,788 --> 00:22:29,454
A queen.

306
00:22:42,162 --> 00:22:45,370
EURON: The moment I was chosen
Lord of the Iron Islands,

307
00:22:45,371 --> 00:22:47,745
they turned on me.
(CHUCKLES)

308
00:22:47,746 --> 00:22:48,994
Their own uncle.

309
00:22:48,995 --> 00:22:51,620
They stole
my best ships and ran.

310
00:22:51,621 --> 00:22:53,787
Sailed them
right across the world

311
00:22:53,788 --> 00:22:56,078
and gave them
to the Dragon Queen

312
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:59,537
so she could bring her
armies here to attack you.

313
00:22:59,538 --> 00:23:02,994
It's nothing compared
to the treason you suffered

314
00:23:02,995 --> 00:23:06,662
at the hands of a family
member, from what I hear.

315
00:23:06,663 --> 00:23:09,371
But still, it bothers me.

316
00:23:10,995 --> 00:23:14,036
Murdering them would
make me feel a lot better.

317
00:23:14,037 --> 00:23:18,203
And since it appears that all
our treasonous family members

318
00:23:18,204 --> 00:23:20,119
are fighting for the same side,

319
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,662
I thought we rightful monarchs

320
00:23:22,663 --> 00:23:25,246
could murder them together.

321
00:23:31,246 --> 00:23:34,037
You're not a rightful
monarch, though, are you?

322
00:23:38,162 --> 00:23:41,161
The Greyjoys rebelled against the
throne for the right to be monarchs,

323
00:23:41,162 --> 00:23:45,203
but as I recall,
you were soundly defeated.

324
00:23:45,204 --> 00:23:47,036
Come to mention it,

325
00:23:47,037 --> 00:23:49,411
weren't you the one
who started that rebellion

326
00:23:49,412 --> 00:23:53,620
by sailing to Casterly Rock
and burning the Lannister fleet?

327
00:23:53,621 --> 00:23:55,328
You certainly caught us there.

328
00:23:55,329 --> 00:23:58,161
Very smart move on your part.

329
00:23:58,162 --> 00:24:02,411
Of course, we all made it
to the Iron Islands anyway.

330
00:24:02,412 --> 00:24:03,620
I was there.

331
00:24:03,621 --> 00:24:05,453
I remember very well.

332
00:24:05,454 --> 00:24:06,994
I saw you.

333
00:24:06,995 --> 00:24:09,286
I heard so much talk.

334
00:24:09,287 --> 00:24:12,911
The best in the world.
No one can stop him.

335
00:24:12,912 --> 00:24:14,620
I didn't believe it,
to be honest.

336
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:17,911
But I must say when you
rushed through the breach

337
00:24:17,912 --> 00:24:20,079
and started
cutting people down...

338
00:24:23,579 --> 00:24:25,286
it was glorious.

339
00:24:25,287 --> 00:24:26,703
Like a dance.

340
00:24:26,704 --> 00:24:29,911
The people I was cutting
down were your own kin.

341
00:24:29,912 --> 00:24:32,245
The place was getting crowded.

342
00:24:32,246 --> 00:24:34,828
I enjoyed watching it.
I truly did.

343
00:24:34,829 --> 00:24:37,036
And I enjoyed killing Greyjoys.

344
00:24:37,037 --> 00:24:39,495
A good thing for me.

345
00:24:39,496 --> 00:24:43,119
If you hadn't crushed us, I
wouldn't have gone into exile.

346
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,036
If I hadn't done that,

347
00:24:45,037 --> 00:24:48,621
I wouldn't be the greatest
captain on the 14 seas.

It's the greatest armada
Westeros has ever seen.

357
00:25:17,287 --> 00:25:21,869
With the Iron Fleet,
you own the seas.

358

the invaders of the east

363

in the world.

364

You're not trustworthy.

370
00:25:58,788 --> 00:26:00,869
You've broken promises
to allies before

371
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:03,328
and murdered them
at the nearest opportunity.

372
00:26:03,329 --> 00:26:04,870
You murdered your own brother.

373
00:26:06,204 --> 00:26:08,537

if I could have access to the

how to defeat them,

00:30:36,995 --> 00:30:39,537

424

for your grating obsession

is that you're telling the truth

what you say you saw.
