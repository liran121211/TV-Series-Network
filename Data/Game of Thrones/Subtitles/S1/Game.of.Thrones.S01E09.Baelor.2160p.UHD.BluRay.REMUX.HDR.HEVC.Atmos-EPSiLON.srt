1
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:11,923
You've seen better days, my lord.

2
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:15,218
Another visit?

3
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,972
It seems you're my last friend.

4
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:21,933
No, no, many still love you.

5
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:27,314
Sansa came to court this morning
to plead for your life.

6
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:31,234
On her knees begging for me. Hm!

7
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,487
Did you laugh with the others?

8
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:37,157
You do me wrong, my lord.
Your blood is the last thing I want.

9
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,159
I don't know what you want.

10
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,911
I've given up trying to guess.

11
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,541
When I was still a boy -

12
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:50,462
before they cut my balls off
with a hot knife -

13
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:54,007
I traveled with a group of actors
through the free cities.

14
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:58,637
They taught me that each
man has a role to play.

15
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:01,515
The same is true at court.

16
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,892
I am the master of whisperers.

17
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:08,397
My role is to be sly, obsequious
and without scruples.

18
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,482
I'm a good actor, my lord.

19
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,860
Huh. Can you free me from this pit?

20
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,987
I could.

21
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,447
But will I?

22
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:19,908
No.

23
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,993
As I said, I'm no hero.

24
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,870
What do you want? Tell me.

25
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,832
No riddles, no stories...
Tell me, what do you want?

26
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,544
Peace.

27
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:36,717
Did you know that your son is marching south
with an army of northmen? Loyal lad.

28
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:39,177
Fighting for his father's freedom.

29
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,471
Robb?

30
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,390
He's just a boy.

31
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:45,726
Boys have been conquerors before.

32
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:52,399
But the man giving Cersei sleepless nights
is the king's... the late king's brother.

33
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:55,277
Lord Stannis has the best
claim to the throne.

34
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:58,572
He is a proven battle commander
and he is utterly without mercy.

35
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:03,076
Stannis Baratheon is Robert's true heir.
The throne is his by rights.

36
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:09,916
Sansa pleaded so sweetly for your life.
It would be a shame to throw it away.

37
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:13,545
Cersei is no fool.

38
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,965
She knows a tame wolf is more
use to her than a dead one.

39
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,635
You want me to serve the woman who murdered
my king, who butchered my men,

40
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,345
who crippled my son?

41
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:24,389
I want you to serve the realm!

42
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:27,225
Tell the queen you will confess
your vile treason,

43
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,352
tell your son to lay down his sword

44
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:32,689
and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir.

45
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:37,736
Cersei knows you as a man of honor.

46
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:42,616
If you give her the peace she needs,
and promise to carry her secret to your grave,

47
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:45,327
I believe she will allow
you to take the black

48
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:48,955
and live out your days on the Wall
with your brother and your bastard son.

49
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,001
You think my life is some
precious thing to me?

50
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:57,839
That I would trade my honor
for a few more years of...

51
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,591
Of what?

52
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,556
You grew up with actors.

53
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,019
You learned their craft
and you learnt it well.

54
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:14,481
But I grew up with soldiers.

55
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,944
I learned how to die a long time ago.

56
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:23,782
Pity.

57
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:26,743
Such a pity.

58
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,961
What of your daughter's life, my lord?

59
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:38,505
Is that a precious thing to you?

60
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,883
It's a birthday message
to his grand-niece Walda.

61
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:26,720
- Or so Walder Frey would have you think.
- Keep shooting them down.

62
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:29,890
We can't risk Lord Walder sending word
of your movements to the Lannisters.

63
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:32,976
He's Grandfather's bannerman.
We can't expect his support?

64
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:36,897
Expect nothing of Walder Frey
and you'll never be surprised.

65
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:38,148
Look.

66
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,110
Father rots in a dungeon.

67
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,321
How long before they take his head?

68
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,449
We need to cross the Trident
and we need to do it now.

69
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:50,035
Just march up to his gates
and tell him you're crossing.

70
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,079
We've got five times his numbers.
You can take the Twins if you have to.

71
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:56,583
Not in time. Tywin Lannister
marches north as we speak.

72
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,377
The Freys have held
the crossing for 600 years,

73
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:02,631
and for 600 years they have
never failed to exact their toll.

74
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,008
Have my horse saddled and ready.

75
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:08,219
Enter the Twins alone and he'll sell
you to the Lannisters as he likes.

76
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:11,139
Or throw you in a dungeon.
Or slit your throat.

77
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,895
My father would do whatever
it took to secure our crossing.

78
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,272
Whatever it took.

79
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:23,944
If I'm going to lead this army, I can't have
other men doing my bargaining for me.

80
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:25,236
I agree.

81
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:28,448
- I'll go.
- You can't!

82
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:32,869
I have known Lord Walder since I was a girl.
He would never harm me.

83
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,413
Unless there was a profit in it.

84
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,004
What do you want?

85
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:46,675
It is a great pleasure to see you again
after so many years, my lord.

86
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,510
Oh, spare me.

87
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:52,722
Your boy's too proud
to come before me himself.

88
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,849
What am I supposed to do with you?

89
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:57,978
Father, you forget yourself.
Lady Stark is here...

90
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:04,192
Who asked you? You're not Lord Frey yet,
not until I die. Do I look dead to you?

91
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:08,071
- Father, please...
- I need lessons in courtesy from you, bastard?

92
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:13,576
Your mother would still be a milkmaid
if I hadn't squirted you into her belly.

93
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,166
All right, you come forward.

94
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,305
There. Now that I've
observed the courtesies,

95
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:37,809
perhaps my sons will do me
the honor of shutting their mouths.

96
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,191
Is there somewhere we can talk?

97
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,318
We're talking right now.

98
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:52,866
Fine.

99
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,535
Out! All of you!

100
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,297
- Oh!
- You too.

101
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,806
You see that?

102
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,975
Fifteen, she is.

103
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,894
A little flower.

104
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,440
And her honey's all mine.

105
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,195
I'm sure she will give you many sons.

106
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,948
Huh. Your father didn't
come to the wedding.

107
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,992
He is quite ill, my lord.

108
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:39,245
Huh. Didn't come to the last one, either.

109
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,539
Or the one before that.

110
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,168
Your family has always pissed on me.

111
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:48,171
- My lord, I...
- Don't deny it. You know it's true.

112
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:52,717
The fine Lord Tully would never
marry any of his children to mine.

113
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,762
- I'm sure there were reasons...
- I didn't need reasons.

114
00:09:55,887 --> 00:10:00,558
I needed to get rid of sons and daughters.
You see how they pile up?

115
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,106
Why are you here?

116
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:09,776
To ask you...

117
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,153
to open your gates, my lord...

118
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:16,783
so my son and his bannermen may cross
the Trident and be on their way.

119
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:19,953
- Why should I let him?
- If you could climb your own battlements,

120
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:23,581
you would see that he has
20,000 men outside your walls.

121
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:27,085
They'll be 20,000 corpses when
Tywin Lannister gets here.

122
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,546
Don't try and frighten me, Lady Stark.

123
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:32,048
Your husband's in a cell
beneath the Red Keep

124
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:35,009
and your son's got no fur
to keep his balls warm.

125
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,470
You swore an oath to my father.

126
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:40,640
Oh, yes, I said some words.

127
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,935
And I swore oaths to the crown too,
if I remember right.

128
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,312
Joffrey's king now,

129
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:51,067
which makes your boy and his corpses-to-be
nothing but rebels, it seems to me.

130
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:56,990
If I had the sense the gods gave a fish,
I'd hand you both over to the Lannisters.

131
00:10:57,115 --> 00:11:01,995
- Why don't you?
- Stark, Tully, Lannister, Baratheon.

132
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:08,209
Give me one good reason why I should
waste a single thought on any of you?

133
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,712
And... engage!

134
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:16,009
When does Aemon think you'll be
able to use that hand?

135
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,303
- Soon, he says.
- Good.

136
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:22,182
You'll be ready for this, then.

137
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:26,978
I thought a wolf was more
appropriate for you than a bear...

138
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,566
so I had a new pommel made.
It's called Longclaw.

139
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,320
Works as well for a wolf as a bear, I think.

140
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,999
This is Valyrian steel.

141
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:53,713
It was my father's sword,
his father before him.

142
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:57,217
The Mormonts have
carried it for five centuries.

143
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:59,344
It was meant for my son Jorah.

144
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:05,183
He brought dishonor to our House,
but he had the grace to leave the sword

145
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,560
before he fled from Westeros.

146
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:11,731
- My lord, you honor me, but I can't...
- Oh, you can.

147
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,566
And you will.

148
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:17,570
I wouldn't be standing here if it
wasn't for you and your beast.

149
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,365
A bloody dead man tried to kill me.

150
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:26,079
So you'll take it.
I'll hear no more about it.

151
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,915
- Is that understood?
- Yes, my lord.

152
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,625
Right.

153
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:36,631
Now, don't think this means I approve of this
nonsense with you and Alliser Thorne.

154
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:40,218
That's a man's sword.
It'll take a man to wield it.

155
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,596
I'll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight.

156
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:47,100
No, you won't.
I sent him to King's Landing yesterday.

157
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:51,229
The hand that your wolf
tore off that thing's wrist...

158
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:54,649
I've, uh, ordered Thorne
to lay it at the feet of this...

159
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,609
boy king.

160
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:59,570
That should get young
Joffrey's attention.

161
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:05,785
And it, uh, puts a thousand leagues
between you and Thorne.

162
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,454
Now go and put your sword
somewhere safe...

163
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,957
and bring me my supper.

164
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:12,625
Yes, my lord.

165
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,514
- Well done.
- Well done.

166
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,268
You earned that, Snow.

167
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,274
Well done.

168
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,196
Go on, let's have a look.

169
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,615
- At what?
- The sword! Show us the sword.

170
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:47,660
Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword!

171
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:51,039
Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword!

172
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:57,962
- Let's have a look.
- Piss off.

173
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,968
Come on, I want to have
a look at it in the light.

174
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,848
Give it here!

175
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,850
What is it?

176
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,977
- I...
- Look at its eyes.

177
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,604
- Give it.
- I can't.

178
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,190
You can't what?

179
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:18,483
I...

180
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,779
I'm really not supposed to say.

181
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:25,531
And yet you really want to say.

182
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,617
You want to say that...?

183
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,706
There was a raven.

184
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,708
I read the message to Maester Aemon.

185
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:40,004
It's your brother Robb.

186
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,881
What?

187
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,508
What about him?

188
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:46,469
He's heading south.

189
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,388
To war.

190
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:54,435
All his bannermen have rallied to his side.
They'll keep him safe.

191
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:57,897
I should be there.

192
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,526
I should be with him.

193
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,668
If we do that, they'll never
get back across.

194
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:22,255
Well?

195
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,048
What did he say?

196
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:27,677
Lord Walder has granted your crossing.

197
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,723
- His men are yours, as well.
- Huh.

198
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:36,602
Less the 400 he will keep here to hold
the crossing against any who would pursue you.

199
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,104
What does he want in return?

200
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:42,442
You will be taking on his son
Olyvar as your personal squire.

201
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:45,403
- He expects a knighthood in good time.
- Fine, fine.

202
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:49,073
And?

203
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:52,243
And Arya...

204
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:56,164
will marry his son Waldron
when they both come of age.

205
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,916
- She won't be happy about that.
- Hm.

206
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,172
And?

207
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:06,340
And...

208
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,594
when the fighting is done...

209
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,098
you will marry one of his daughters.

210
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,185
Whichever you prefer.

211
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,646
He has a number he thinks will be... suitable.

212
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,648
I see.

213
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,819
Did you get a look at his daughters?

214
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,362
I did.

215
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:30,781
And?

216
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:33,701
One was...

217
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,417
Do you consent?

218
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:45,129
- Can I refuse?
- Not if you want to cross.

219
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,301
Then I consent.

220
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,307
Sam said you wanted to see me?

221
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,768
I did indeed.

222
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,854
Perhaps you would be kind
enough to assist me.

223
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:52,572
Tell me, did you ever wonder why
the men of the Night's Watch

224
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:55,741
take no wives and father no children?

225
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,535
No.

226
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,370
So they will not love.

227
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:03,874
Love is the death of duty.

228
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,795
If the day should ever come when
your lord father was forced to choose...

229
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,256
between honor on the one hand...

230
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:12,800
and those he loves on the other,

231
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,260
what would he do?

232
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:19,432
He... He would do whatever was right.
No matter what.

233
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:23,686
Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,000.

234
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,397
Most of us are not so strong.

235
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,108
What is honor...

236
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,902
compared to a woman's love?

237
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:34,447
And what is duty...

238
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:38,075
against the feel of a newborn
son in your arms?

239
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,578
Or a brother's smile?

240
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,459
Sam told you.

241
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:48,586
We're all human.

242
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:51,881
Oh, we all do our duty when
there's no cost to it.

243
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:54,800
Honor comes easy then.

244
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,385
Yet...

245
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,429
sooner or later...

246
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,473
in every man's life...

247
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:03,601
there comes a day when it is not easy.

248
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,771
A day when he must choose.

249
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,650
And this is my day?

250
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:12,818
Is that what you're saying?

251
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:16,030
Oh, it hurts, boy. Oh, yes.

252
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,991
- I know.
- You do not know.

253
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,912
No one knows.

254
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:26,666
I may be a bastard,

255
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,251
but he is my father
and Robb is my brother.

256
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:37,843
The gods were cruel when
they saw fit to test my vows.

257
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,970
They waited till I was old.

258
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:45,518
What could I do when the ravens
brought the news from the South...

259
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:48,020
the ruin of my House,
the death of my family?

260
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,022
I was helpless...

261
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,401
blind, frail.

262
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,154
But...

263
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:00,783
when I heard they had
killed my brother's son...

264
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,993
and his poor son...

265
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,495
and the children!

266
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,914
Even the little children.

267
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:10,668
Who are you?

268
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:16,590
My father was Maekar,

269
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:18,801
the first of his name.

270
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:23,139
My brother Aegon reigned after him...

271
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:26,142
when I had refused the throne.

272
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:29,687
And he was followed by his son Aerys...

273
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:32,732
whom they called the Mad King.

274
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:34,483
You're Aemon Targaryen.

275
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,238
I'm a maester of the Citadel,

276
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:43,534
bound in service to Castle Black
and the Night's Watch.

277
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:50,666
I will not tell you... to stay or go.

278
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,253
You must make that choice yourself...

279
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:57,631
and live with it for the rest of your days.

280
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:02,678
As I have.

281
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:24,116
<font color="#ffff00">My lord...</font>

282
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,744
<font color="#ffff00">My sun and stars...</font>

283
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,915
Drogo.

284
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:43,969
<font color="#ffff00">My horse...</font>

285
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,930
<font color="#ffff00">Blood of my blood...</font>

286
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:49,934
<font color="#ffff00">No, I must ride.</font>

287
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:52,436
<font color="#ffff00">He fell from his horse.</font>

288
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:57,149
<font color="#ffff00">A Khal who cannot ride is no Khal.</font>

289
00:21:57,274 --> 00:22:00,361
<font color="#ffff00">He's tired, that's all.
He needs to rest.</font>

290
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:04,698
<font color="#ffff00">We've ridden far enough today.
We'll camp here.</font>

291
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:07,034
<font color="#ffff00">This is no place to camp.</font>

292
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,329
<font color="#ffff00">A woman does not give us orders.
Not even a Khaleesi.</font>

293
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:14,416
<font color="#ffff00">We'll camp here.
Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it.</font>

294
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:17,086
<font color="#ffff00">You do not command me, Khaleesi.</font>

295
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,339
<font color="#ffff00">Find Mirri Maz Duur.
Bring her to me.</font>

296
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:23,050
<font color="#ffff00">The witch?
I'll bring you her head, Khaleesi.</font>

297
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:28,931
<font color="#ffff00">Bring her to me unharmed or Khal Drogo
will hear why you denied me.</font>

298
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:36,981
Hyah! Hyah!

299
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:01,422
Our scouts tell us the Stark host
has moved south from the Twins

300
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:03,883
with Lord Frey's levies in tow.

301
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:06,510
They're a day's march north.

302
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:09,013
The boy may lack experience and sense,

303
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:11,557
but he does have a certain mindless...

304
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,269
- provincial courage.
- Ah.

305
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:20,900
Oh, do continue.
Didn't mean to interrupt.

306
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:23,402
I do hope your savages
are going to be of some use,

307
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,571
otherwise we've wasted
good steel on them.

308
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:29,074
The great hairy one insisted
he must have two battleaxes.

309
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:31,619
Heavy black steel, double-sided.

310
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:33,579
Shagga likes axes.

311
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:38,417
When the battle commences, you and
your wildlings will be in the vanguard.

312
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,085
- The vanguard?
- Mm-hm.

313
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,796
Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?

314
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:45,299
They do seem rather ferocious.

315
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:49,595
Ferocious?

316
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:54,433
Last night... a Moon Brother stabbed
a Stone Crow over a sausage.

317
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:58,270
Three Stone Crows seized the Moon
Brother and opened his throat.

318
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:01,023
Bronn managed to keep Shagga from
chopping off the dead man's cock,

319
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:05,277
which was fortunate, but even still,
Ulf is demanding blood money,

320
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,988
which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay.

321
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:11,241
When soldiers lack discipline,
the fault lies with their commander.

322
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:14,828
Surely there are ways to have me killed that
would be less detrimental to the war effort.

323
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:17,331
There'll be no more discussion on the matter.

324
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,922
It appears I'm not hungry after all.

325
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:26,632
Excuse me, my lords.

326
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,815
Where did you find one
so pretty at this hour?

327
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,109
- I took her.
- Took her?

328
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:48,278
- From whom?
- From, uh...

329
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:50,197
Ser... What's his name?

330
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:56,161
- I don't know. Ginger cunt, three tents down.
- And he didn't have anything to say about it?

331
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:59,540
He said something.

332
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:07,381
Well, the odds of me living long enough for him
to retaliate have just dropped drastically.

333
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,758
We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow.

334
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,555
Oh, well.

335
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:19,935
I, uh... think I'll go and find myself one.

336
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,941
Who are you?

337
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,444
Who would you like me to be?

338
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:30,237
What did your mother call you?

339
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:33,449
Shae. What did your mother call you?

340
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:35,909
My mother died giving birth to me.

341
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,663
Is that why I'm here?
So we can talk about our mothers?

342
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:43,042
- What sort of accent is that?
- Foreign.

343
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:44,835
For...

344
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:48,130
What do you want from me?

345
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:51,008
What do I want from you?

346
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:54,094
I want you to share my tent.

347
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:57,222
I want you to pour my wine,
laugh at my jokes,

348
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:59,892
rub my legs when they're
sore after a day's ride.

349
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:04,021
I want you to take no other man
to bed for as long as we're together.

350
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:08,734
And I want you to fuck me
like it's my last night in this world.

351
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:10,861
Which it may well be.

352
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,529
And what do I get?

353
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,239
One - safety.

354
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:18,410
No one will hurt you
for as long as you're mine.

355
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:22,164
Two - the pleasure of my company,

356
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,917
which I have heard is spectacular.

357
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:27,169
Who told you this?
Women you paid?

358
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:28,879
And three...

359
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:33,050
more gold than you can spend
if you lived a thousand years.

360
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:37,012
Do you accept my proposal?

361
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:58,909
Let's start with your
last night in this world.

362
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,235
Khaleesi.

363
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,403
Come.

364
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:38,949
He's very strong.

365
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:41,785
No one understands how strong he is.

366
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,807
- He will die tonight, Khaleesi.
- He can't.

367
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,560
He can't. I won't let him.

368
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:09,771
Even a queen doesn't have that power.

369
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:15,903
We must go quickly.
I've heard there's a good port in Asshai.

370
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:20,073
- I won't leave him.
- He's already gone, Khaleesi.

371
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:22,159
Doth...

372
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:23,994
Even if...

373
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,497
Even if he dies...

374
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:30,042
why would I run?

375
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:35,756
I am khaleesi, and my...
my son will be khal after Drogo.

376
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:39,009
This isn't Westeros,
where men honor blood.

377
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:43,722
Here they only honor strength.
There will be fighting after Drogo dies.

378
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:46,558
Whoever wins that fight
will be the new khal.

379
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:48,685
He won't want any rivals.

380
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:53,482
Your boy will be plucked from your
breast and given to the dogs.

381
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:57,361
I won't... leave him.

382
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:09,081
The wound has festered.

383
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:12,167
<font color="#ffff00">You did this, witch.</font>

384
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,086
<font color="#ffff00">Stop it!</font>

385
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:15,754
<font color="#ffff00">I don't want her hurt.</font>

386
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:21,051
<font color="#ffff00">No? No? You don't want her hurt?</font>

387
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:29,017
<font color="#ffff00">Pray we don't hurt you, too.
You let this witch put her hands on our Khal.</font>

388
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:32,771
<font color="#ffff00">Rein in your tongue.
She is still your Khaleesi.</font>

389
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:35,691
<font color="#ffff00">Only while the blood of my blood lives.</font>

390
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:43,615
<font color="#ffff00">When he dies, she is nothing.</font>

391
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:54,751
<font color="#ffff00">I have never been nothing.
I am the blood of the dragon.</font>

392
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:02,259
<font color="#ffff00">The dragons are all dead, Khaleesi.</font>

393
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,311
I think you should wear
your armor tonight, ser.

394
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:15,105
I think you're right.

395
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:24,323
- You've saved me once more.
- And now you must save him.

396
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:26,658
He's beyond the healer's skills.

397
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:29,161
All I can do is ease his path.

398
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:31,455
Save him and I will free you. I swear it.

399
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:34,666
You must know a way.

400
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:36,501
Some...

401
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:39,212
Some magic.

402
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,008
There is a spell.

403
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:46,386
Some would say death is cleaner.

404
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:57,981
Do it.

405
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,567
Save him.

406
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:03,487
- There is a price.
- You'll have gold, whatever you want.

407
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:05,864
It's not a matter of gold.
This is bloodmagic.

408
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:07,991
Only death pays for life.

409
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:13,038
My death?

410
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:15,916
No, not your death, Khaleesi.

411
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:19,294
Bring me his horse.

412
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,569
Khaleesi, do not do this thing.

413
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:47,989
- Let me kill this witch.
- Kill her and you kill your khal.

414
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:51,034
This is bloodmagic.
It is forbidden.

415
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:54,746
I am your khaleesi.
I tell you what is forbidden.

416
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:06,466
Go. Now.

417
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,468
- Take her and leave.
- Uh-uh.

418
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:09,761
Take her!

419
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:19,563
You must go also, lady. Once I begin
to sing, no one must enter the tent.

420
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:22,232
The dead will dance here tonight.

421
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,330
No one will enter.

422
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:47,924
Bring him back to me.

423
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:06,109
What have you done?

424
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,487
I have to save him.

425
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:11,865
We could have been 10 miles away
from here by now, on the way to Asshai.

426
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,950
You would have been safe.

427
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:23,710
<font color="#ffff00">This must not be.</font>

428
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,337
<font color="#ffff00">This must be.</font>

429
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:26,671
<font color="#ffff00">Witch.</font>

430
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,634
<font color="#ffff00">No, you can't.</font>

431
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:32,636
Khaleesi!

432
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:36,473
<font color="#ffff00">No further, horselord.</font>

433
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:18,473
Are you hurt?

434
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:19,558
- The baby...
- Hmm?

435
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:21,309
...is coming.

436
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:25,272
- Fetch the midwives.
- They will not come. They say she is cursed.

437
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,817
They'll come or I'll have their heads.

438
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:33,738
The witch - she can bring baby.
I hear her say so.

439
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:58,847
Are you in agony, my lion?

440
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:01,391
- No.
- You look like you're in agony.

441
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:04,894
The fire is burning your pretty soft skin.

442
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:10,150
Ah!

443
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:14,446
Damn you, woman.
Are you immune to pain?

444
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:16,615
- Just used to it.
- Drink.

445
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:20,744
Let's play a new game.

446
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:24,831
There's a Braavosi knife
game I could teach you.

447
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:28,043
Does it involve the potential
for losing fingers?

448
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:30,670
- Not if you win.
- No!

449
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:33,340
No fire games, no knife games.

450
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:38,303
- Let's do something I'm good at.
- What are you good at?

451
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:40,305
I happen to be a great
judge of character.

452
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,641
- This sounds like a boring game.
- It's not.

453
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:46,853
Here's how it works - I make
a statement about your past.

454
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:50,106
If I'm right, you drink.
If I'm wrong, I drink.

455
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:53,109
And no lying.
I'll know if you're lying.

456
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:55,070
I don't want to play this game.

457
00:35:55,195 --> 00:35:57,113
Fine. Bronn first.

458
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:03,578
Your father beat you.

459
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:11,252
But my mother hit harder.

460
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:17,175
You killed your first man
before you were 12.

461
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,094
It was a woman.

462
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:23,723
She swung an axe at me.

463
00:36:25,475 --> 00:36:27,060
You've been north of the Wall.

464
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,148
What brought you up there?

465
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:35,568
- Work.
- And...

466
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:40,031
you once loved a woman many
years ago, but it turned out badly

467
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,950
so you've never let yourself love again.

468
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:46,162
Oh, wait, that's me.

469
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:52,168
Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty.

470
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:53,837
I don't want to play.

471
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:57,716
It's fun! Look at the fun we're having.

472
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:03,346
Your mother was a whore.

473
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:05,515
Drink.

474
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:14,190
All right.

475
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:17,736
Your father left the family when you
were very young, never to return.

476
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:18,987
Drink.

477
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:23,032
- And we've established the rules about lying?
- Drink!

478
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:27,954
Mm.

479
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,000
You wanted a different life.

480
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:34,836
You came from somewhere and
you wanted to be elsewhere.

481
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:37,630
The whole shit-stained world
could drink off that one.

482
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:39,841
So, specifics...

483
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:43,428
You wanted to be elsewhere,
but how would you get there?

484
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:47,307
I don't believe the life
of the Silent Sisters is for you.

485
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:51,102
So... what's a lowborn girl to do?

486
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:56,024
Drink.

487
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,570
- Are you sure...
- Drink!

488
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:09,954
And don't talk about my mother
and father ever,

489
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,582
or I will carve your eyes from your head.

490
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:20,006
My dear lady, if I have
offended you, I apologize.

491
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:22,133
My turn.

492
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:24,302
Fine, fine.

493
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:25,929
Ask away.

494
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:29,682
Try to penetrate the enigma that is me.

495
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:32,727
- Who were you in love with?
- That's not how the game works.

496
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:35,188
I don't care the way the game works.

497
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,273
Our lord here used to be married.

498
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:40,360
- Married?
- How did you hear that?

499
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:43,780
You hear lots of things playing
dice with Lannister soldiers.

500
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,951
Another night, perhaps.

501
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:51,079
Not another night. This night.

502
00:38:52,622 --> 00:38:54,249
It's not a pleasant story.

503
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:57,836
Oh, maybe I will cry.

504
00:38:57,961 --> 00:39:02,423
I'm guessing the lady and I can tell more
unpleasant stories than your lordship.

505
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,636
So...

506
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:15,770
I was 16. My brother Jaime and I were
riding, when we heard a scream.

507
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:20,358
She ran out onto the road, clothes half
torn off, with two men on her heels.

508
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:24,988
Jaime scared away the men easily enough,
while I wrapped her in my cloak.

509
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:26,906
She was too scared
to send off on her own,

510
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:32,036
so while Jaime hunted down the rapers
I took her to the nearest inn and fed her.

511
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:34,539
Her name was Tysha.

512
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:36,833
She was a wheelwright's orphan.

513
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:39,127
And she was hungry.

514
00:39:39,252 --> 00:39:42,505
Together we finished off three
chickens and a flagon of wine.

515
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:46,801
Impossible as it seems, there was a time
when I was unaccustomed to wine.

516
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:50,054
I forgot how afraid I was around girls...

517
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:53,516
how I was always waiting
for them to laugh at me or...

518
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:54,934
look away embarrassed,

519
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,729
or ask me about my tall,
handsome brother.

520
00:39:57,854 --> 00:40:00,189
I forgot about everything but Tysha.

521
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:04,235
And somehow I found myself in her bed.

522
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,238
For three chickens, I should hope so.

523
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:10,408
It didn't last long.
I didn't know what the hell I was doing.

524
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:12,869
But she was good to me.

525
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:14,954
She kissed me afterwards and...

526
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:17,457
sang me a song.

527
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:22,587
And by morning I was deep enough
in love to ask for her hand.

528
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:25,965
A few lies, a few gold coins,
one drunken septon

529
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,259
and there you have it - man and wife.

530
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:34,265
For a fortnight anyway, until the septon
sobered up and told my father.

531
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,893
Well, I imagine that was
the end of all that.

532
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:38,478
Not quite.

533
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:42,607
First, my father had
Jaime tell me the truth.

534
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:46,736
The girl was a whore, you see.

535
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:53,451
Jaime had arranged the whole thing -
the road, the rapers... all of it.

536
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:56,037
He thought it was time I had a woman.

537
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:00,249
After my brother confessed...

538
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,378
my father brought in my wife

539
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:05,421
and gave her to his guards.

540
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:09,676
He paid her well - a silver for each man.

541
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:12,679
How many whores command
that kind of price?

542
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:17,976
He brought me into the barracks
and made me watch.

543
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:21,437
By the end, she had so much silver

544
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:26,275
that the coins were slipping through
her fingers and rolling on to the floor.

545
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:33,116
I would have killed the man
who did that to me.

546
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:36,244
You should have known she was a whore.

547
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,204
Really?

548
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:41,499
I was 16, drunk and in love.

549
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:46,963
A girl who was almost raped doesn't invite
another man into her bed two hours later.

550
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:51,592
As I said, I was young and stupid.

551
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:56,514
You are still young and stupid.

552
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:22,123
Hyah!

553
00:42:38,765 --> 00:42:42,226
- What is it? What do you want?
- You're sleeping through the war.

554
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:45,063
- What?
- They stole a night's march on us.

555
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:46,689
They're a mile north.

556
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:49,901
- Get my squire!
- You don't have a squire.

557
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,322
If I die, weep for me.

558
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:58,618
You'll be dead.
How will you know?

559
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:06,834
I'll know.

560
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:10,630
Watch out! Move!

561
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:13,382
Out of the way!

562
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:15,384
Move aside!

563
00:43:21,808 --> 00:43:23,267
Stay low.

564
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:25,812
Stay low?

565
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:28,272
If you're lucky, no one will notice you.

566
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:30,233
I was born lucky.

567
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,738
Tribesmen of the Vale,

568
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:37,156
gather round!

569
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:41,285
Stone Crows!

570
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:43,621
Black Ears!
Burned Men!

571
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:46,332
- Moon Brothers!
- And Painted Dogs!

572
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:49,252
- And Painted Dogs!
- Painted Dogs!

573
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:52,255
Your dominion over the Vale begins now!

574
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:55,216
Onward, to claim what is yours!

575
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:57,426
Half man! Half man!

576
00:43:57,552 --> 00:44:00,847
Half man! Half man!

577
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:03,599
Half man! Half man!

578
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,560
To battle!

579
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:49,604
You're a shit warrior.

580
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,483
I'm alive?

581
00:44:55,443 --> 00:44:56,986
You're alive.

582
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:04,035
Did we win?

583
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,829
We wouldn't be having this
conversation if we didn't.

584
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:22,220
How did our tribesmen do?

585
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:25,848
Yeah, good.

586
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:31,187
- It's nice to see them getting along.
- You're wounded.

587
00:45:32,355 --> 00:45:34,315
Good of you to notice.

588
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:36,442
I hear we won.

589
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:39,111
Huh! The scouts were wrong.

590
00:45:40,029 --> 00:45:42,907
There were 2,000 Stark bannermen, not 20.

591
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:46,077
Did we get the Stark boy, at least?

592
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:47,662
He wasn't here.

593
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:50,206
Where was he?

594
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:52,708
With his other 18,000 men.

595
00:45:56,379 --> 00:45:58,506
And where are they?

596
00:46:08,641 --> 00:46:10,559
- We should go, my lady.
- No!

597
00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:17,316
My lady!

598
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:21,779
Hyah! Hyah!

599
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:57,064
By the time they knew what was happening,
it had already happened.

600
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:04,488
Lady Stark. I'd offer you my sword,
but I seem to have lost it.

601
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:06,532
It is not your sword I want.

602
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:09,660
Give me my daughters back.

603
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:11,620
Give me my husband.

604
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:14,248
I've lost them too, I'm afraid.

605
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:16,834
Kill him, Robb.
Send his head to his father.

606
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:21,714
- He cut down ten of our men. You saw him.
- He's more use to us alive than dead.

607
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:24,925
Take him away and put him in irons.

608
00:47:25,051 --> 00:47:27,511
We could end this war right now, boy,

609
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:29,638
save thousands of lives.

610
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:32,641
You fight for the Starks,
I fight for the Lannisters.

611
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:34,727
Swords or lances, teeth, nails -

612
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:38,564
choose your weapons and
let's end this here and now.

613
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:43,235
If we do it your way, Kingslayer...

614
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,030
you'd win.

615
00:47:49,158 --> 00:47:50,659
We're not doing it your way.

616
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,413
Come on, pretty man.

617
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:08,219
- I sent 2,000 men to their graves today.
- The bards will sing songs of their sacrifice.

618
00:48:08,344 --> 00:48:11,347
Aye. But the dead won't hear them.

619
00:48:18,354 --> 00:48:21,065
One victory does not make us conquerors.

620
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:24,944
Did we free my father?

621
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:28,489
Did we rescue my sisters from the queen?

622
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:33,536
Did we free the North from those
who want us on our knees?

623
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:41,210
This war is far from over.

624
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:14,118
Could I have one?

625
00:49:14,243 --> 00:49:15,995
A lemon one... or any of them.

626
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,746
Three coppers.

627
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:22,251
- How about a nice fat pigeon?
- Oh, piss off now. Go on.

628
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:26,172
Do you have any stale ones from yesterday?
Or any burnt ones?

629
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:27,756
Piss off!

630
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:37,183
Hey, where's everyone going?
What's happening?

631
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:39,477
- They're taking him to the Sept of Baelor.
- Who?

632
00:49:39,602 --> 00:49:41,520
The Hand of the King.

633
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:51,131
- Traitor!
- Coward!

634
00:50:51,257 --> 00:50:53,300
Baelor.

635
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:54,635
Baelor!

636
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:03,018
Traitor! Traitor!

637
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:25,374
I am Eddard Stark...

638
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:27,501
Lord of Winterfell...

639
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:29,962
and Hand of the King.

640
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:41,640
I come before you to confess my treason...

641
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:44,727
in the sight of gods and men.

642
00:51:46,729 --> 00:51:48,397
I betrayed the faith of my king...

643
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:51,525
and the trust of my friend Robert.

644
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:55,404
I swore to protect
and defend his children.

645
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:58,407
But before his blood was cold...

646
00:51:59,408 --> 00:52:02,161
I plotted to murder his son...

647
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:04,788
and seize the throne for myself.

648
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:21,096
Let the High Septon and Baelor the Blessed
bear witness to what I say...

649
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:26,185
Joffrey Baratheon...

650
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:29,438
is the one true heir to the Iron Throne...

651
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:32,983
by the grace of all the gods,

652
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:35,319
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms...

653
00:52:35,444 --> 00:52:37,613
and Protector of the Realm.

654
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:46,997
As... As we sin...

655
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,500
so do we suffer.

656
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:52,670
This man has confessed his crimes...

657
00:52:52,795 --> 00:52:55,214
in sight of gods and men.

658
00:52:55,923 --> 00:52:58,509
The gods are just...

659
00:52:58,634 --> 00:53:02,096
but beloved Baelor taught us...

660
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:04,682
they can also be merciful.

661
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:12,231
What is to be done with this
traitor, Your Grace?

662
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:20,197
My mother wishes me to let
Lord Eddard join the Night's Watch.

663
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:25,661
Stripped of all titles and powers,
he would serve the realm in permanent exile.

664
00:53:25,786 --> 00:53:29,832
And my Lady Sansa...
has begged mercy for her father.

665
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:36,922
But they have the soft hearts of women.

666
00:53:38,257 --> 00:53:40,175
So long as I am your king...

667
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:43,095
treason shall never go unpunished.

668
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:45,347
Ser Ilyn...

669
00:53:46,682 --> 00:53:47,850
bring me his head!

670
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:50,060
No!

671
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:52,020
Someone stop him!

672
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:05,284
My son, this is madness.

673
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:07,494
Put him down!

674
00:54:14,877 --> 00:54:17,212
- Don't look!
- Let me go! Let me go!

675
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:19,882
Shut your mouth!
Look at me! Look at me!

676
00:54:20,007 --> 00:54:22,426
Stop! Daddy! Stop!

677
00:54:22,551 --> 00:54:24,428
- No! No!
- Traitor!

678
00:54:24,553 --> 00:54:25,888
Stop!

679
00:54:29,475 --> 00:54:31,101
Stop him! Stop!
