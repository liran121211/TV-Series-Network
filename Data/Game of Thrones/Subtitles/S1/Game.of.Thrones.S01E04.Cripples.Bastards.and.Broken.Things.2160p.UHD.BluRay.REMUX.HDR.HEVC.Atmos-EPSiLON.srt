1
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:46,416
The little lord's been dreaming again.

2
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:56,468
- We have visitors.
- I don't want to see anyone.

3
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:59,137
Really? If I was cooped up all day

4
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:02,265
with no one but this old bat
for company, I'd go mad.

5
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:05,852
Anyway, you don't have a choice.
Robb's waiting.

6
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:08,897
- I don't want to go.
- Neither do I.

7
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,816
But Robb's Lord of Winterfell,

8
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:13,944
which means I do what he says,
and you do what I say.

9
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:17,114
Hodor!

10
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:23,704
- Hodor?
- Help Bran down the hall.

11
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:25,831
Hodor.

12
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:35,382
I must say I received a slightly
warmer welcome on my last visit.

13
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:38,093
Any man of the Night's Watch
is welcome at Winterfell.

14
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,804
Any man of the Night's Watch,
but not I, eh, boy?

15
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,181
I'm not your boy, Lannister.

16
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:45,392
I'm Lord of Winterfell
while my father is away.

17
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:48,770
Then you might learn a lord's courtesy.

18
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,733
So it's true.

19
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,862
Hello, Bran.

20
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:59,281
Do you remember anything
about what happened?

21
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,825
He has no memory of that day.

22
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,494
- Curious.
- Why are you here?

23
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,665
Would your charming companion
be so kind as to kneel?

24
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:12,252
- My neck is beginning to hurt.
- Kneel, Hodor.

25
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,632
- Do you like to ride, Bran?
- Yes.

26
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,843
Well, I mean I did like to.

27
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,429
- The boy has lost the use of his legs.
- What of it?

28
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,639
With the right horse and saddle,
even a cripple can ride.

29
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:27,684
- I'm not a cripple.
- Then I'm not a dwarf.

30
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,770
My father will rejoice to hear it.

31
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:32,147
I have a gift for you.

32
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,192
Give that to your saddler.
He'll provide the rest.

33
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,571
You must shape the horse to the rider.

34
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:44,034
Start with a yearling and teach it to respond
to the reins and to the boy's voice.

35
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:48,163
- Will I really be able to ride?
- You will.

36
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,415
On horseback you will be
as tall as any of them.

37
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,835
Is this some kind of trick?
Why do you want to help him?

38
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,465
I have a tender spot in my heart
for cripples, bastards and broken things.

39
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,676
You've done my brother a kindness.

40
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,762
The hospitality of Winterfell is yours.

41
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:08,975
Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark.
There's a brothel outside your walls.

42
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,937
There I'll find a bed and both
of us can sleep easier.

43
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:19,694
Couldn't resist some northern arse?

44
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,322
If you like Redheads, ask for Ros.

45
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:25,367
Come to see me off, Greyjoy?
Kind of you.

46
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,786
Your master doesn't seem
to like Lannisters.

47
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,956
- He's not my master.
- No, of course not.

48
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:35,293
What happened here? Where is Lady Stark?
Why didn't she receive me?

49
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:38,129
- She wasn't feeling well.
- She's not in Winterfell, is she?

50
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,048
- Where did she go?
- M'lady's whereabouts...

51
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,676
M'lady?

52
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,595
Your loyalty to your
captors is touching.

53
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,682
Tell me, how do you think
Balon Greyjoy would feel

54
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:52,727
if he could see his only surviving
son has turned lackey?

55
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:56,731
I still remember seeing my father's
fleet burn in Lannisport.

56
00:05:56,857 --> 00:06:00,527
- I believe your uncles were responsible.
- Must have been a pretty sight.

57
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:03,822
Nothing prettier than watching
sailors burn alive.

58
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:08,451
Yes, a great victory for your people.
Shame how it all turned out.

59
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:11,830
- We were outnumbered ten to one.
- A stupid rebellion, then.

60
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:16,334
I suppose your father realized that
when your brothers died in battle.

61
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:19,754
Now here you are, your enemy's squire.

62
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,715
- Careful, Imp.
- I've offended you.

63
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,051
Forgive me, it's been a rough morning.

64
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,054
Anyway, don't despair.

65
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,348
I'm a constant disappointment
to my own father

66
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,726
and I've learned to live with it.

67
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:35,645
Your next tumble with Ros is on me.

68
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,815
I'll try not to wear her out.

69
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:46,072
Shoulder, legs.

70
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:54,039
Leg, shoulder, leg.

71
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:57,042
Left foot forward. Good.

72
00:06:57,167 --> 00:07:01,171
Now pivot as you deliver the stroke.
Put all your weight behind it.

73
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:03,673
What in seven hells is that?

74
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:08,303
They'll need an eighth hell to fit him in.

75
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,347
Tell them your name.

76
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:12,390
Samwell Tarly,

77
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:16,436
of Horn Hill... I mean, I was of Horn Hill.

78
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,146
I've come to take the black.

79
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,899
Come to take the black pudding.

80
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,902
Well, you couldn't be
any worse than you look.

81
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,946
Rast...

82
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:28,073
see what he can do.

83
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,832
I yield.

84
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,460
- Please, no more.
- On your feet.

85
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,754
Pick up your sword.

86
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,507
Hit him till he finds his feet.

87
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:57,560
It seems they've run short
of poachers and thieves down south.

88
00:07:57,686 --> 00:08:00,397
- Now they send us squealing bloody pigs.
- Jon!

89
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,816
Again, harder.

90
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:06,403
- I yield!
- Enough!

91
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:09,447
He yielded.

92
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,076
Looks like the bastard's in love.

93
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,914
All right then, Lord Snow,

94
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:21,209
you wish to defend your lady love,
let's make it an exercise.

95
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,295
You two. Three of you
ought to be sufficient

96
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,631
to make lady piggy squeal.

97
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,718
All you've got to do is
get past the bastard.

98
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,764
- Are you sure you want to do this?
- No.

99
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:51,031
Yield, yield, yield! I yield.

100
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,619
We're done for today.
Go clean the armory.

101
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:59,414
That's all you're good for.

102
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,961
- Well fought!
- Piss off.

103
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:12,761
- Did he hurt you?
- I've had worse.

104
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,848
You can call me Sam... if you want.

105
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,977
- My mother calls me Sam.
- It's not going to get any easier, you know?

106
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:24,689
- You're going to have to defend yourself.
- Why didn't you get up and fight?

107
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,068
I wanted to.

108
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:30,945
- I just couldn't.
- Why not?

109
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,657
I'm a coward.

110
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:38,787
- My father always says so.
- The Wall's no place for cowards.

111
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,914
You're right. I'm sorry.

112
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,834
I just... wanted to thank you.

113
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,763
A bloody coward.

114
00:09:56,888 --> 00:10:00,975
People saw us talking to him.
Now they'll think we're cowards too.

115
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,852
You're too stupid to be a coward.

116
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,896
- You're too stupid to be a...
- Quick now,

117
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,857
before summer's over.

118
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:10,026
Come here!

119
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:41,766
Hyah, hyah!

120
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:49,107
Vaes Dothrak - the city of the horselords.

121
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:53,695
A pile of mud.
Mud and shit and twigs.

122
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,323
- Best these savages can do.
- These are my people now.

123
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,742
- You shouldn't call them savages.
- I'll call them what I like,

124
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:03,621
because they're my people.
This is my army.

125
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:07,750
Khal Drogo is marching
the wrong way with my army.

126
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:29,522
If my brother was given
an army of Dothraki,

127
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:33,193
could you conquer the Seven Kingdoms?

128
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:36,070
The Dothraki have never
crossed the narrow sea.

129
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,406
They fear any water
their horses can't drink.

130
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,074
But if they did?

131
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:44,621
King Robert is fool enough
to meet them in open battle,

132
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:47,332
but the men advising him are different.

133
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:51,794
- And you know these men?
- I fought beside them once,

134
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,838
long ago.

135
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,299
Now Ned Stark wants my head.

136
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,676
He drove me from my land.

137
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:02,388
You sold slaves.

138
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,141
Aye.

139
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:10,063
- Why?
- I had no money

140
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:12,273
and an expensive wife.

141
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,150
And where is she now?

142
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:16,527
In another place,

143
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:18,863
with another man.

144
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,247
- Your Grace?
- Yes, my dear?

145
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,958
They call you the last dragon...

146
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,669
They do.

147
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:38,049
You have dragon's blood in your veins?

148
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,176
It's entirely possible.

149
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:43,763
What happened to the dragons?

150
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,933
I was told that brave
men killed them all.

151
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,982
The brave men didn't kill dragons.

152
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,526
The brave men rode them.

153
00:12:56,651 --> 00:13:00,029
Rode them from Valyria to build
the greatest civilization

154
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:02,615
this world has ever seen.

155
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:07,078
The breath of the greatest dragon
forged the Iron Throne,

156
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:10,081
which the Usurper
is keeping warm for me.

157
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:14,168
The swords of the vanquished,

158
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,421
a thousand of them...

159
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:20,883
melted together like so many candles.

160
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:27,974
I have always wanted to see a dragon.

161
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:31,602
There's nothing in the world
that I would rather see.

162
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:34,272
Really. Why dragons?

163
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,858
They can fly.

164
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:39,944
And wherever they are,
just a few flaps of their wings

165
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,530
and they're somewhere else...

166
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,699
far away.

167
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,579
And they can kill.

168
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:54,792
Anyone or anything
that tries to hurt them

169
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:58,463
gets burned away to nothing...

170
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:00,340
...melted...

171
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:03,259
like so many candles.

172
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,969
Ow.

173
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:10,933
Yes. Seeing a dragon
would make me very happy.

174
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,061
Well, after 15 years
in a pleasure house,

175
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,772
I imagine just seeing the sky
makes you happy.

176
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:18,691
I was not locked in.
I have seen things.

177
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,485
- What have you seen?
- I've seen...

178
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:24,489
a man from Asshai with a dagger
of real dragonglass.

179
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,491
- Ooh.
- I've seen a man who could

180
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:31,329
change his face the way that
other men change their clothes.

181
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:35,041
And I've seen a pirate who
wore his weight in gold

182
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:39,587
and whose ship had sails of colored silk.

183
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:42,924
So...

184
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,511
have you seen one?

185
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:49,639
- A pirate ship?
- A dragon.

186
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,683
No.

187
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:56,312
No, the last one died many
years before I was born.

188
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,482
I'll tell you what I have seen -

189
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:02,777
their skulls.

190
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,863
They used to decorate the throne
room in the Red Keep.

191
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,407
When I was very young,
just three or four,

192
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:10,034
my father used to walk me down the rows

193
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,412
and I'd recite their names for him.

194
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:16,207
When I got them all right,
he'd give me a sweet.

195
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:19,210
The ones closest to the door were
the last ones they were able to hatch

196
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:23,881
and they were all stunted and wrong
with skulls no bigger than dog skulls.

197
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:29,512
But... But as you got closer
to the Iron Throne...

198
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:32,890
they got bigger

199
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:36,018
and bigger and bigger.

200
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:41,315
There was Ghiscar

201
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,901
and Valryon,

202
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,736
Vermithrax,

203
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:48,072
Essovius...

204
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,616
...Archonei,

205
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:54,036
Meraxes,

206
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,081
Vhagar...

207
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,794
and Balerion the Dread...

208
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:07,008
...whose fire forged the Seven Kingdoms

209
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,177
into one.

210
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:16,017
What happened to the skulls?

211
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,604
I don't know.

212
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:22,982
The Usurper had them smashed
to powder, I expect.

213
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,943
Scattered to the wind.

214
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:32,825
- That's very sad.
- Yes, it is.

215
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,288
What did I buy you for?

216
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,583
- To make me sad?
- No, Your Grace.

217
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:44,962
To, uh, teach your sister.

218
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:48,090
To teach my sister how
to be a better lover?

219
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:51,385
You think I bought you
to make Khal Drogo happy?

220
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:58,809
Oh, you pretty little idiot.

221
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,939
Go on, then.
Get on with it.

222
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:17,995
Someday your husband will sit there
and you will sit by his side.

223
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:23,626
And one day, before too long,
you will present your son to the court.

224
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:28,381
All the lords of Westeros will gather
here to see the little prince.

225
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:30,591
- What if I have a girl?
- Gods be good,

226
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,636
you'll have boys and girls
and plenty of them.

227
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,846
What if I only have girls?

228
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:37,848
I wouldn't worry about that.

229
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:41,102
Jeyne Poole's mother had
five children - all of them girls.

230
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,187
Yes, but it's highly unlikely.

231
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,648
But what if?

232
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:49,026
Well, if you only had girls,

233
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:52,738
I suppose the throne would pass
to Prince Joffrey's little brother.

234
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,491
And everyone would hate me.

235
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,702
Nobody could ever hate you.

236
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:00,580
- Joffrey does.
- Nonsense.

237
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:03,040
Why would you say such a thing?

238
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,961
That business with the wolves? Sansa...

239
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,005
I've told you a hundred times -

240
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:12,049
- a direwolf is not...
- Please shut up about it.

241
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,261
Do you remember your lessons?

242
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:22,059
- Who built the Iron Throne?
- Aegon the Conqueror.

243
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:25,730
- And who built the Red Keep?
- Maegor the Cruel.

244
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:27,648
And how many years
did it take to build...

245
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:32,111
My grandfather and uncle were
murdered here, weren't they?

246
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:35,489
They were killed on the orders
of King Aerys, yes.

247
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:39,827
- The Mad King.
- Commonly known as the Mad King.

248
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,663
Why were they killed?

249
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,250
You should speak to your father
about these matters.

250
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,502
I don't want to speak
to my father, ever.

251
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:51,756
Sansa, you will find it in your heart

252
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:55,509
- to forgive your father.
- No, I won't.

253
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:59,013
It's the Hand's Tournament that's
causing all this trouble, my lords.

254
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:04,352
The King's Tournament. I assure
you the Hand wants no part of it.

255
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,479
Call it what you will, Lord Stark, ser,

256
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:09,732
the city is packed with people
and more flooding in every day.

257
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,693
Last night we had
a tavern riot, a brothel fire,

258
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,780
three stabbings and a drunken horse
race down the Street of Sisters.

259
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:18,574
- Dreadful.
- If you can't keep the king's peace,

260
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,702
perhaps the City Watch should be
commanded by someone who can.

261
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,454
- I need more men.
- You'll get 50.

262
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,415
- Lord Baelish will see it paid for.
- I will?

263
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:30,002
You found money for a champion's purse,
you can find money to keep the peace.

264
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,006
I'll also give you
20 of my household guard

265
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:37,510
- till the crowds have left.
- Thank you, my lord Hand, ser.

266
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:40,346
They will be put to good use.

267
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,516
The sooner this is over, the better.

268
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:46,352
The realm prospers from
such events, my lord.

269
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:50,606
They give the great a chance at glory,
and the lowly a respite from their woes.

270
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,484
And every inn in the city is full

271
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,486
and the whores are walking bow-legged.

272
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,988
I'm sure the tourney puts
coins in many a pocket.

273
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:00,574
- Hmm.
- Now...

274
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,119
if there's nothing else, my lords?

275
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:14,922
Oh, this heat.

276
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,842
On days like this,
I envy you northerners,

277
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,761
your summer snows.
Until tomorrow, my lord.

278
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,514
I've been hoping to talk
to you about Jon Arryn.

279
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,350
Lord Arryn?

280
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:31,021
Oh, his death was a great
sadness to all of us.

281
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:36,193
I took personal charge of his care,
but I could not save him.

282
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:42,032
His sickness struck him
very hard and very fast.

283
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:46,662
I saw him in my chambers just
the night before he passed.

284
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:51,625
- Lord Jon often came to me for counsel.
- Why?

285
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:56,422
I have been grand
maester for many years.

286
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:59,592
Kings and Hands have come
to me for advice since...

287
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:02,595
What did Jon want
the night before he died?

288
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,139
Oh, he came inquiring after a book.

289
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,517
A book? What book?

290
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:12,980
Oh, I fear it would be of little
interest to you, my lord.

291
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,566
A... A ponderous tome.

292
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:19,195
No, I'd like to read it.

293
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:24,575
The Lineages and Histories

294
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,870
of the Great Houses
of the Seven Kingdoms,

295
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,998
with descriptions of many high lords

296
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:34,126
and noble ladies

297
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,295
and their children.

298
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,981
Harkon Umber, first of his name,

299
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:59,693
born to Lord Hother Umber
and Lady Amaryllis Umber

300
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:02,404
in the 183rd year after Aegon's landing,

301
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:05,699
at the Last Hearth.
Blue of eye, brown of hair

302
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:09,245
and fair complected,
died in his 14th year

303
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,539
of a wound sustained in a bear hunt.

304
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:15,334
As I said, my lord, a ponderous read.

305
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:18,045
Did Jon Arryn tell you
what he wanted with it?

306
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,006
He did not, my lord.
And I did not presume to ask.

307
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:23,300
- Jon's death...
- Such a tragedy.

308
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,803
...did he say anything to you
during his final hours?

309
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:27,805
Nothing of import, my lord.

310
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:32,601
Oh. There was one phrase
he kept repeating.

311
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:36,021
"The seed is strong," I think it was.

312
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:38,357
- "The seed is strong"?
- Mmm.

313
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,734
- What does that mean?
- Oh,

314
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:44,488
the dying mind is
a demented mind, Lord Stark.

315
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,657
For all the weight they're given,

316
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:50,494
last words are usually
as significant as first words.

317
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:53,622
And you're quite certain
he died of a natural illness?

318
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,749
What else could it be?

319
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:00,880
- Poison.
- A disturbing thought.

320
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:03,299
No, no, no, I don't think it likely.

321
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:07,845
The Hand was loved by all.
What sort of man would dare...

322
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,681
I've heard it said that poison
is a woman's weapon.

323
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:15,144
Yes, women, cravens...

324
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:16,937
and eunuchs.

325
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:21,233
Did you know that
Lord Varys is a eunuch?

326
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:25,529
- Everybody knows that.
- Yes, yes, of course.

327
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:28,365
How that sort of person found himself

328
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:32,494
- on the king's council, I will never know.
- I've taken enough of your time.

329
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,539
No trouble at all, my lord.
It's a great honor.

330
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,207
Thank you.

331
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,335
I'll find my own way out.

332
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:06,195
Syrio says a water dancer can
stand on one toe for hours.

333
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,155
It's a hard fall down these steps.

334
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:12,576
Syrio says every hurt is a lesson
and every lesson makes you better.

335
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:18,332
- Tomorrow I'm going to be chasing cats.
- Cats? Syrio says.

336
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,793
He says every swordsman
should study cats.

337
00:24:20,918 --> 00:24:23,879
They're as quiet as shadows
and as light as feathers.

338
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:28,050
- You have to be quick to catch them.
- He's right about that.

339
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:32,262
Now that Bran's awake,
will he come live with us?

340
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:37,726
Well, he needs to get
his strength back first.

341
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:39,937
He wants to be a knight
of the Kingsguard.

342
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:44,191
- He can't be one now, can he?
- No.

343
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:50,406
But someday he could
be lord of a holdfast

344
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:53,450
or sit on the king's council.

345
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:58,288
Or he might raise castles
like Brandon the Builder.

346
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:02,710
Can I be lord of a holdfast?

347
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:09,758
You will marry a high lord
and rule his castle.

348
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:14,972
And your sons shall be knights
and princes and lords.

349
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:19,059
- Hmm?
- No.

350
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:22,104
That's not me.

351
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,712
Hello.

352
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,799
Ser Alliser said I'm to be
your new watch partner.

353
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,095
I should warn you,

354
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,598
I don't see all that well.

355
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:00,601
Come stand by the fire.

356
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,854
- It's warmer.
- No, that's all right. I'm fine.

357
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:06,648
You're not. You're freezing.

358
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:21,413
I don't like high places.

359
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:25,375
You can't fight. You can't see.

360
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:28,921
You're afraid of heights and almost
everything else probably.

361
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,965
What are you doing here, Sam?

362
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:40,224
On the morning of my 18th nameday,
my father came to me.

363
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:44,728
"You're almost a man now," he said.

364
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:49,066
"But you're not worthy
of my land and title.

365
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:51,693
"Tomorrow, you're going
to take the black,

366
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:55,197
"forsake all claim to your
inheritance and start north.

367
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:59,535
"If you do not," he said,

368
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:03,038
"then we'll have a hunt

369
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:06,250
"and somewhere in these woods
your horse will stumble

370
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:09,169
"and you'll be thrown
from your saddle to die.

371
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:13,382
"Or so I'll tell your mother.

372
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:15,884
"Nothing would please me more."

373
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:25,602
Ser Alliser's going to make me
fight again tomorrow, isn't he?

374
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,604
Yes, he is.

375
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:30,274
I'm not going to get
any better, you know.

376
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:33,610
Well...

377
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:35,445
you can't get any worse.

378
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:48,375
I hear you're reading a boring book.

379
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,210
Hmph.

380
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:54,006
- Pycelle talks too much.
- Oh, he never stops.

381
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:56,466
Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale?

382
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:59,052
Not surprising.

383
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:03,682
Until recently, he was only
a squire - Jon Arryn's squire.

384
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:08,020
He was knighted almost immediately
after his master's untimely death.

385
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:10,147
Knighted for what?

386
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:14,735
- Why are you telling me this?
- I promised Cat that I'd help you.

387
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,112
Where is Ser Hugh?

388
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:19,907
- I'll speak to him.
- A singularly bad idea.

389
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:22,492
Do you see that boy there?

390
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:25,162
One of Varys's little birds.

391
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:28,832
The spider has taken a great
interest in your comings and goings.

392
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,876
Now look there.

393
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:33,837
That one belongs to the queen.

394
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:38,175
And do you see that septa
pretending to read her book?

395
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:42,387
- Varys or the queen?
- No, she's one of mine.

396
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:48,227
Is there someone in your service
whom you trust completely?

397
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:52,814
- Yes.
- The wiser answer was no, my lord.

398
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:58,195
Get a message to this paragon
of yours - discreetly.

399
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,822
Send him to question Ser Hugh.

400
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:04,952
After that, you might want him to visit
a certain armorer in the city.

401
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:07,913
He lives in a large house
at the top of the Street of Steel.

402
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:10,457
- Why?
- I have my observers, as I said,

403
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,876
and it's possible that they saw Lord Arryn

404
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:17,089
visit this armorer several times
in the weeks before his death.

405
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:21,551
Lord Baelish, perhaps I was
wrong to distrust you.

406
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:26,056
Distrusting me was the wisest thing you've
done since you climbed off your horse.

407
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,732
...22, 23,

408
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:39,653
24, 5, 6, 27,

409
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,488
- 28, 29...
- Ser Hugh?

410
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,615
30, 31, 32...

411
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,909
- Ser Hugh!
- As you can see, I'm busy.

412
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:51,206
I'm here on behalf of Lord Eddard Stark,
the Hand of the King.

413
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:54,835
- I'm the captain of his guard.
- I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name, Ser...

414
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,046
- No "ser". I'm not a knight.
- I see.

415
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:00,841
Well, it just so happens that I am.

416
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:08,932
He said he'd be glad to talk
to the Hand himself.

417
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:12,227
- He's a knight, you see.
- Ah, a knight.

418
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:15,814
They strut around like roosters down here.

419
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:18,817
Even the ones who've never seen
an arrow coming their way.

420
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,652
You shouldn't be out here, my lord.

421
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:25,157
- There's no telling who has eyes where.
- Let them look.

422
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:29,453
The former Hand did call on me,
my lord, several times.

423
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:32,539
I regret to say he did not
honor me with his patronage.

424
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:37,044
- What did Lord Arryn want?
- He always came to see the boy.

425
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:41,340
- I'd like to see him as well.
- As you wish, my lord.

426
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:43,342
Gendry!

427
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,430
Here he is.

428
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:51,516
Strong for his age.
He works hard.

429
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,478
Show the Hand the helmet you made, lad.

430
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:11,036
- This is fine work.
- It's not for sale.

431
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:13,080
Boy, this is the King's Hand!

432
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:16,583
- If his lordship wants the helmet...
- I made it for me.

433
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:20,379
- Forgive him, my lord.
- There's nothing to forgive.

434
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:24,007
When Lord Arryn came to visit you,
what would you talk about?

435
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,009
He just asked me questions
is all, my lord.

436
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:28,136
What kind of questions?

437
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:33,225
About my work at first,

438
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:36,436
if I was being treated well,
if I liked it here.

439
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:41,400
But then he started asking
me about my mother.

440
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:44,986
- Your mother?
- Who she was, what she looked like.

441
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:47,406
What did you tell him?

442
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:51,618
She died when I was little.

443
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,578
She had yellow hair.

444
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,832
She'd sing to me sometimes.

445
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:01,837
Look at me.

446
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:13,515
Get back to work, lad.

447
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:19,646
If the day ever comes when that boy
would rather wield a sword than forge one,

448
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:23,150
you send him to me.

449
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,613
Find anything?

450
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:31,867
King Robert's bastard son.

451
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:37,581
He likes that.

452
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:42,043
This is for the king from Lord Stark.

453
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:44,212
Should I leave it with...

454
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:47,924
Shhh. Listen.

455
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:50,594
Do you hear them?

456
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:56,391
How many do you think are
in there with him? Huh?

457
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,977
- Guess.
- Three.

458
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:01,146
Four.

459
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,442
He likes to do this when I'm on duty.

460
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,611
He makes me listen
as he insults my sister.

461
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,535
- Forgive me, my lord...
- Why do I have to forgive you?

462
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,078
Have you wronged me?

463
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:23,376
- We've met before, you know.
- Have we? Strange, I've forgotten.

464
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:27,130
The siege of Pyke. We fought
side by side one afternoon.

465
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:28,965
Ah.

466
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,009
- That's where you got your scar?
- Aye.

467
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:34,304
- Oh.
- One of the Greyjoys nearly took my eye.

468
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:37,224
- Vicious sons of whores.
- They like their bloodshed.

469
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:39,601
They stopped liking it at the end.

470
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:42,938
That was a proper battle.

471
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:46,274
Do you remember Thoros of Myr
charging through the breach?

472
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:50,403
With his burning sword?
I'll remember that till the day I die.

473
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:53,657
I saw the youngest
of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell.

474
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:56,451
It was like seeing a shark
on a mountaintop.

475
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:59,913
- Theon? He's a good lad.
- I doubt it.

476
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:07,337
I'll bet you smell of blackberry jam!

477
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:10,298
Let me smell it. Come here.

478
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:14,803
Can I leave this with you?
The message from Lord Stark.

479
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:17,138
I don't serve Lord Stark.

480
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:42,747
- Where have you been?
- Watch duty.

481
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:45,166
- With Sam.
- Ah, Prince Porkchop.

482
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:47,127
- Where is he?
- He wasn't hungry.

483
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:49,004
Impossible!

484
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:51,172
That's enough.

485
00:34:57,429 --> 00:35:00,307
Sam's no different from the rest of us.

486
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:03,893
There was no place for him
in the world, so he's come here.

487
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:06,479
We're not going to hurt him
in the training yard anymore.

488
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:09,316
Never again, no matter what Thorne says.

489
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:11,860
He's our brother now and we're
going to protect him.

490
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:15,530
You are in love, Lord Snow.

491
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:19,868
You girls can do as you please.

492
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:22,746
But if Thorne puts me up
against Lady Piggy,

493
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:24,873
I'm gonna slice me off a side of bacon.

494
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,732
No one touches Sam.

495
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,207
What are you waiting for?

496
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,134
Attack him!

497
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,689
You get in there.

498
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:37,112
Hit me.

499
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:40,448
Go on, hit me!

500
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:44,994
I yield!

501
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,996
Yield. Yield.

502
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:49,207
I yield.

503
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:54,587
You think this is funny, do you?

504
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:03,012
When you're out there beyond the Wall
with the sun going down,

505
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:04,848
do you want a man at your back?

506
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:07,308
Or a sniveling boy?

507
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:24,367
You send this whore
to give me commands?

508
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:27,078
I should have sent you back her head!

509
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:29,456
Forgive me, Khaleesi.
I did as you asked.

510
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:32,584
Hush now. It's all right.
Irri, take her and leave us.

511
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:34,878
Yes, Khaleesi.

512
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:40,091
- Why did you hit her?!
- How many times do I have to tell you?

513
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:43,970
- You do not command me.
- I wasn't commanding you.

514
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,680
I just wanted to invite you to supper.

515
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,932
- What's this?
- It's a gift.

516
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:50,685
- I had it made for you.
- Dothraki rags?

517
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,604
- Are you going to dress me now?
- Please.

518
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:55,148
This stinks of manure. All of it.

519
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,150
Stop. Stop. Stop it.

520
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,736
You would turn me into one
of them, wouldn't you?

521
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:02,489
- Next you'll want to braid my hair.
- You've no right to a braid.

522
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:07,327
- You've won no victories yet.
- You do not talk back to me!

523
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:13,124
You are a horselord's slut.
And now you've woken the dragon...

524
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:22,383
I am a khaleesi of the Dothraki!

525
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:27,555
I am the wife of the great khal
and I carry his son inside me.

526
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,392
The next time you raise a hand to me

527
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:34,604
will be the last time you have hands.

528
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:45,782
I know for a fact that some of the officers
go to that brothel in Mole's Town.

529
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:48,284
I wouldn't doubt it.

530
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,578
Don't you think it's a little bit unfair?

531
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:55,792
Making us take our vows while they
sneak off for a little Sally on the side?

532
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:58,294
- Sally on the side?
- It's silly, isn't it?

533
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:01,756
What, we can't defend the Wall
unless we're celibate?

534
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:06,469
- It's absurd.
- I didn't think you'd be so upset about it.

535
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:09,305
Why not?

536
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,224
Because I'm fat?

537
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:14,727
- No.
- But I like girls just as much as you do.

538
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:18,439
They might not like me as much.

539
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:23,611
I've never... been with one.

540
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:27,532
You've probably had hundreds.

541
00:39:27,657 --> 00:39:28,658
No.

542
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:32,704
As a matter of fact,

543
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,373
I'm the same as you.

544
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,500
Yeah. Yeah, I...

545
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,335
I find that hard to believe.

546
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,963
I came very close once.

547
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:45,174
I was alone in a room
with a naked girl, but...

548
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:49,554
- Didn't know where to put it?
- I know where to put it.

549
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:51,514
Was she...

550
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,725
old and ugly?

551
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:56,477
Young and gorgeous.

552
00:39:57,979 --> 00:39:59,981
A whore named Ros.

553
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:04,110
What color hair?

554
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,905
- Red.
- Oh, I like red hair.

555
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:09,908
And her, um...

556
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:11,701
Her...

557
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,370
- You don't want to know.
- What, that good?

558
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:16,205
- Better.
- Oh, no.

559
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:23,421
So why exactly did you not make
love to Ros with the perfect...?

560
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:28,885
- What's my name?
- Jon Snow.

561
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,971
And why is my surname Snow?

562
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:34,974
Because...

563
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,477
you're a bastard from the North.

564
00:40:39,312 --> 00:40:41,814
I never met my mother.

565
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,609
My father wouldn't even
tell me her name.

566
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:46,903
I don't know if she's living or dead.

567
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:53,368
I don't know if she's a noblewoman
or a fisherman's wife...

568
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,288
or a whore.

569
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:01,751
So I sat there

570
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:05,088
in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes.

571
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:08,716
But I couldn't do it.

572
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:14,222
Because all I could think was
what if I got her pregnant

573
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:19,352
and she had a child,
another bastard named Snow?

574
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:26,734
It's not a good life for a child.

575
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:28,945
Ah, mmm.

576
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,241
So...

577
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:35,994
you didn't know where to put it?

578
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,835
Enjoying yourselves?

579
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:47,797
You look cold, boys.

580
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:50,800
It is a bit nippy.

581
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,761
A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire,

582
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:55,805
indoors.

583
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,640
It's still summer.

584
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:01,519
Do you boys even remember
the last winter?

585
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:05,481
How long has it been now?
What, 10 years?

586
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:08,067
I remember.

587
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:10,653
Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell?

588
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:12,739
Were there days when you
just couldn't get warm,

589
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:16,159
never mind how many fires
your servants built?

590
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:19,120
- I build my own fires.
- That's admirable.

591
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:23,291
I spent six months out there,
beyond the Wall

592
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:26,169
during the last winter.

593
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:30,131
It was supposed to be
a two-week mission.

594
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:33,509
We heard a rumor Mance Rayder
was planning to attack Eastwatch.

595
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:36,429
So we went out to look
for some of his men -

596
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:39,140
capture them, gather some knowledge.

597
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:42,810
The wildlings who fight for
Mance Rayder are hard men.

598
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:45,021
Harder than you'll ever be.

599
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:47,648
They know their country
better than we do.

600
00:42:47,774 --> 00:42:50,234
They knew there was a storm coming in.

601
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:54,822
So they hid in their caves
and waited for it to pass.

602
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,409
And we got caught in the open.

603
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,328
Wind so strong

604
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:04,499
it yanked 100-foot trees straight
from the ground, roots and all.

605
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:07,335
If you took your gloves off to find
your cock to have a piss,

606
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:10,505
you lost a finger to the frost.

607
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,423
And all in darkness.

608
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,096
You don't know cold.

609
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:20,139
Neither of you do.

610
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:24,977
The horses died first.

611
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:30,691
We didn't have enough to feed
them, to keep them warm.

612
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,987
Eating the horses was easy.

613
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:40,034
But later when we started to fall...

614
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,871
That wasn't easy.

615
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:48,876
We should have had a couple of boys
like you along, shouldn't we?

616
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:56,092
Soft, fat boys like you.

617
00:43:56,217 --> 00:44:01,139
We'd have lasted a fortnight on you
and still had bones left over for soup.

618
00:44:03,933 --> 00:44:06,769
Soon we'll have new recruits

619
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:10,148
and you lot will be passed along
to the lord commander

620
00:44:10,273 --> 00:44:12,191
for assignment,

621
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:16,821
and they will call you men
of the Night's Watch,

622
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:18,573
but you'd be fools to believe it.

623
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:22,118
You're boys still.

624
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:25,872
And come the winter you will die...

625
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,333
like flies.

626
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,967
I hit him.

627
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:39,427
I hit the dragon.

628
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:41,846
Your brother Rhaegar
was the last dragon.

629
00:44:41,971 --> 00:44:44,515
Viserys is less than
the shadow of a snake.

630
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:48,769
- He is still the true king.
- The truth now.

631
00:44:48,895 --> 00:44:52,857
Do you want to see your brother
sitting on the Iron Throne?

632
00:44:52,982 --> 00:44:54,400
No.

633
00:44:55,151 --> 00:44:57,528
But the common people
are waiting for him.

634
00:44:57,653 --> 00:45:01,949
Illyrio said they are sewing dragon
banners and praying for his return.

635
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:06,746
The common people pray for rain,
health and a summer that never ends.

636
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:10,166
They don't care what games
the high lords play.

637
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:12,919
What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?

638
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:18,299
Home.

639
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,677
I pray for home too.

640
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:28,142
My brother will never take
back the Seven Kingdoms.

641
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:33,648
He couldn't lead an army even
if my husband gave him one.

642
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,903
He'll never take us home.

643
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:01,008
Lovers' quarrel?

644
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:02,551
I'm sorry. Do I...?

645
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:05,096
Sansa dear, this is Lord Baelish.

646
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:07,348
- He's known...
- An old friend of the family.

647
00:46:08,224 --> 00:46:10,393
I've known your mother a long, long time.

648
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:12,645
- Why do they call you Littlefinger?
- Arya!

649
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:15,564
- Don't be rude!
- No, it's quite all right.

650
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:19,819
When I was a child, I was very small,

651
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:22,029
and I come from a little spit
of land called the Fingers,

652
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:26,284
so you see, it's an exceedingly
clever nickname.

653
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:29,078
I've been sitting here for days!

654
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:32,707
Start the damn joust
before I piss myself!

655
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:43,092
Gods, who's that?

656
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:45,553
Ser Gregor Clegane.

657
00:46:45,678 --> 00:46:48,556
They call him the Mountain.

658
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,852
The Hound's older brother.

659
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:56,147
- And his opponent?
- Ser Hugh of the Vale.

660
00:46:56,272 --> 00:46:58,107
He was Jon Arryn's squire.

661
00:46:58,232 --> 00:46:59,775
Look how far he's come.

662
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:04,155
Yes, yes, enough of the bloody pomp.
Have at him!

663
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:26,153
Not what you were expecting?

664
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:33,285
Has anyone ever told you the story
of the Mountain and the Hound?

665
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:37,039
Lovely little tale of brotherly love.

666
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:41,710
The Hound was just a pup,

667
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:43,963
six years old maybe.

668
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:46,090
Gregor a few years older,

669
00:48:46,215 --> 00:48:49,969
already a big lad, already
getting a bit of a reputation.

670
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:55,975
Some lucky boys just born
with a talent for violence.

671
00:48:56,100 --> 00:49:02,231
One evening Gregor found his little brother
playing with a toy by the fire -

672
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,650
Gregor's toy,

673
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:07,403
a wooden knight.

674
00:49:07,528 --> 00:49:09,405
Gregor never said a word,

675
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:12,491
he just grabbed his brother
by the scruff of his neck

676
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:15,911
and shoved his face
into the burning coals.

677
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:19,665
Held him there while the boy screamed,

678
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,917
while his face melted.

679
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:30,050
There aren't very many people
who know that story.

680
00:49:30,176 --> 00:49:33,762
- I won't tell anyone. I promise.
- No, please don't.

681
00:49:33,888 --> 00:49:37,099
If the Hound so much
as heard you mention it,

682
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:41,562
I'm afraid all the knights in King's Landing
would not be able to save you.

683
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:57,411
My lord, Her Grace the queen.

684
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:03,167
- Your Grace.
- You're missing your tournament.

685
00:50:03,292 --> 00:50:06,504
Putting my name on it
doesn't make it mine.

686
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:11,425
I thought we might put what happened
on the Kingsroad behind us -

687
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:14,136
the ugliness with the wolves.

688
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:17,973
And forcing you to kill
the beast was extreme.

689
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:22,770
Though sometimes we go to extremes
where our children are concerned.

690
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:25,773
How is Sansa?

691
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:29,777
- She likes it here.
- She's the only Stark who does.

692
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:33,822
Favors her mother,
not much of the North in her.

693
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:37,618
- What are you doing here?
- I might ask the same of you.

694
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:39,828
What is it you hope to accomplish?

695
00:50:39,954 --> 00:50:42,790
The king called on me
to serve him and the realm,

696
00:50:42,915 --> 00:50:45,251
and that's what I'll do
until he tells me otherwise.

697
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:48,045
You can't change him.
You can't help him.

698
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:50,798
He'll do what he wants,
which is all he's ever done.

699
00:50:50,923 --> 00:50:53,676
You'll try your best
to pick up the pieces.

700
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:56,387
If that's my job, then so be it.

701
00:50:58,013 --> 00:51:00,349
You're just a soldier, aren't you?

702
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:04,103
You take your orders and you carry on.

703
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:06,146
I suppose it makes sense.

704
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:09,275
Your older brother was trained to lead
and you were trained to follow.

705
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:12,486
I was also trained to kill
my enemies, Your Grace.

706
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,242
As was I.

707
00:51:36,385 --> 00:51:38,178
Seven blessings to you, goodfolk!

708
00:51:39,138 --> 00:51:40,097
And to you.

709
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:42,349
Boy! Bread, meat and beer. Quickly.

710
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:44,893
Ah, good idea, Grandfather.
I'm starving.

711
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:48,564
- A song while we wait or...?
- I'd rather throw myself down a well.

712
00:51:48,689 --> 00:51:52,276
Now, now, Grandfather, this may be
your last chance if you're heading North.

713
00:51:52,401 --> 00:51:55,404
The only music the northerners
know is the howling of wolves!

714
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:59,074
Gods.

715
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:00,743
I'm sorry, my lord. We're full up.

716
00:52:00,868 --> 00:52:03,662
- Every room.
- My men can sleep in the stable.

717
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:06,915
As for myself, I don't
require a large room.

718
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:12,004
- Truly, my lord, we have nothing.
- Is there nothing I can do...

719
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:14,465
...to remedy this?

720
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:17,885
- You can have my room.
- Now there's a clever man.

721
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:22,222
You can manage food, I trust?
Yoren, dine with me.

722
00:52:22,348 --> 00:52:24,266
- Aye, my lord.
- My lord of Lannister!

723
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:26,935
Might I entertain you while you eat?

724
00:52:27,061 --> 00:52:29,813
I can sing of your father's
victory at King's Landing!

725
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:33,525
Nothing would more
likely ruin my supper.

726
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:37,780
Lady Stark!
What an unexpected pleasure.

727
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:41,283
I was sorry to have
missed you at Winterfell.

728
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:43,202
Lady Stark!

729
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:55,798
I was still Catelyn Tully
the last time I stayed here.

730
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:00,427
You, ser.

731
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:05,599
Is that the black bat of Harrenhal
I see embroidered on your coat?

732
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:07,226
It is, my lady.

733
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:10,020
And is Lady Whent a true
and honest friend

734
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:14,149
to my father, Lord Hoster
Tully of Riverrun?

735
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:15,776
She is.

736
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:21,365
The red stallion was always
a welcome sight at Riverrun.

737
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:26,745
My father counts Jonos Bracken amongst
his oldest and most loyal bannermen.

738
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:29,456
Our lord is honored by his trust.

739
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:32,501
I envy your father all his
fine friends, Lady Stark,

740
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:36,130
but I don't quite see
the purpose of this.

741
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:39,591
I know your sigil as well -

742
00:53:40,843 --> 00:53:43,512
the twin towers of Frey.

743
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:45,764
How fares your lord, ser?

744
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:48,308
Lord Walder is well, my lady.

745
00:53:48,434 --> 00:53:52,020
He has asked your father for the honor
of his presence on his 90th nameday.

746
00:53:52,146 --> 00:53:54,314
- He plans to take another wife.
- Ha!

747
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:02,865
This man...

748
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:05,951
came into my house as a guest

749
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:09,955
and there conspired to murder my son.

750
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:13,333
A boy of 10.

751
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:18,255
In the name of King Robert
and the good lords you serve,

752
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:21,175
I call upon you to seize him

753
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:24,678
and help me return him to Winterfell

754
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:27,097
to await the king's justice.
