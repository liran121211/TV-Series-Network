1
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:26,146
Does Ser Hugh have
any family in the capital?

2
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,773
No.

3
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,818
I stood vigil for him myself last night.

4
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,821
He had no one else.

5
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:38,784
He'd never worn this armor before.

6
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:42,829
Bad luck for him - going
against the Mountain.

7
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:45,165
Who determines the draw?

8
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,417
All the knights draw straws, Lord Stark.

9
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,336
Aye.

10
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:51,630
But who holds the straws?

11
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,884
You've done good work, Sisters.

12
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,599
Life is strange.

13
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:06,144
Not so many years ago we fought
as enemies at the Trident.

14
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,189
I'm glad we never met
on the field, Ser Barristan.

15
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:12,526
As is my wife. I don't think
the widow's life would suit her.

16
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:14,861
You're too modest.

17
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,489
I've seen you cut down
a dozen great knights.

18
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:21,159
My father once told me you
were the best he'd ever seen.

19
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:24,204
I never knew the man to be
wrong about matters of combat.

20
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,331
He was a fine man, your father.

21
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,543
What the Mad King did to him
was a terrible crime.

22
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,253
And that lad -

23
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,380
he was a squire until a few months ago.

24
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:36,508
How could he afford a new suit of armor?

25
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,969
Perhaps Lord Arryn left him some money?

26
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:44,433
- I hear the king wants to joust today.
- Yes, that will never happen.

27
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:47,269
Robert tends to do what he wants.

28
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,896
If the king got what he
wanted all the time,

29
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,524
he'd still be fighting
a damned rebellion.

30
00:03:57,404 --> 00:04:00,574
It's made too small, Your Grace.
It won't go.

31
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:03,410
Your mother was a dumb
whore with a fat arse.

32
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:05,537
Did you know that?

33
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:11,084
Look at this idiot!
One ball and no brains.

34
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,004
He can't even put a man's
armor on him properly.

35
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,965
- You're too fat for your armor.
- Fat?

36
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,551
Fat, is it?

37
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,053
Is that how you speak to your king?

38
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,062
Oh, it's funny, is it?

39
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:36,067
- No, Your Grace.
- No?

40
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:38,528
You don't like the Hand's joke?

41
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,947
You're torturing the poor boy.

42
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,742
You heard the Hand.
The king's too fat for his armor.

43
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:46,787
Go find the breastplate stretcher - now!

44
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:52,125
"The breastplate stretcher"?

45
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,377
How long before he figures it out?

46
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:57,631
- Maybe you should have one invented.
- All right, all right.

47
00:04:57,756 --> 00:05:00,717
You watch me out there.
I still know how to point a lance.

48
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:03,470
You've no business jousting.
Leave that for the young men.

49
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:06,932
Why, because I'm king? Piss on that.
I want to hit somebody!

50
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:09,184
- And who's going to hit you back?
- Anybody who can.

51
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,187
- And the last man in his saddle...
- Will be you.

52
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:16,733
There's not a man in the Seven
Kingdoms would risk hurting you.

53
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,152
Are you telling me those
cowards would let me win?

54
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,946
Aye.

55
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,787
- Drink.
- I'm not thirsty.

56
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:31,248
Drink. Your king commands it.

57
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:37,045
Gods,

58
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,631
too fat for my armor.

59
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:43,176
Your squire - a Lannister boy?

60
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,762
Mm. A bloody idiot,

61
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,848
but Cersei insisted.

62
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,351
I have Jon Arryn to thank for her.

63
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:54,354
"Cersei Lannister will make
a good match," he told me.

64
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,148
"You'll need her father on your side."

65
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:03,113
I thought being king meant
I could do whatever I wanted.

66
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,243
Enough of this.
Let's go watch 'em ride.

67
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,037
At least I can smell
someone else's blood.

68
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:13,164
- Robert.
- What?

69
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:16,877
Oh.

70
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,588
An inspiring sight for the people, eh?

71
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,549
Come, bow before your king!
Bow, you shits!

72
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:39,566
- Where's Arya?
- At her dancing lessons.

73
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:45,071
The Knight of the Flowers.

74
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:53,163
Thank you, Ser Loras.

75
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:26,947
Don't let Ser Gregor hurt him.

76
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:29,699
- Hey.
- I can't watch.

77
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,788
A hundred gold dragons on the Mountain.

78
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:38,625
- I'll take that bet.
- Now what will I buy with 100 gold dragons?

79
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,752
A dozen barrels of Dornish wine?

80
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,922
Or a girl from the pleasure houses of Lys?

81
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:47,926
- Or you could even buy a friend.
- He's going to die.

82
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:49,886
Ser Loras rides well.

83
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,168
Such a shame, Littlefinger.

84
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:25,505
It would have been so nice
for you to have a friend.

85
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,507
And tell me, Lord Renly,

86
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,968
when will you be having your friend?

87
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:44,232
Loras knew his mare was in heat.
Quite crafty, really.

88
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,651
Ser Loras would never do that.

89
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:50,697
- There's no honor in tricks.
- No honor and quite a bit of gold.

90
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,909
Sword!

91
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,562
Leave him be!

92
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,711
Stop this madness
in the name of your king!

93
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:54,928
Let him go!

94
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,605
I owe you my life, ser.

95
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,899
I'm no ser.

96
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,091
Remove his hood.

97
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:36,302
♪ On that eve, the captive Imp ♪

98
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:39,973
♪ Downwards from his horse did limp ♪

99
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:43,143
♪ No more would he preen and primp ♪

100
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:44,894
♪ In garb of red and gold ♪

101
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,604
This isn't the Kingsroad.

102
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:50,567
- You said we were riding for Winterfell.
- I did... Often and loudly.

103
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:54,237
Very wise. They'll be out in droves,

104
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,364
looking for me in the wrong place.

105
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,450
Word's probably gotten
to my father by now.

106
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:02,078
He'll be offering a handsome reward.

107
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:05,331
Everyone knows a Lannister
always pays his debts.

108
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,834
Would you be so good as to untie me?

109
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:11,254
- And why would I do that?
- Why not?

110
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,757
Am I going to run?
The hill tribes would kill me for my boots.

111
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:16,467
Unless a shadowcat ate me first.

112
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:19,554
Shadowcats and hill tribes
are the least of your concerns.

113
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:24,309
Ah, the eastern road.

114
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,352
We're going to the Vale.

115
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:30,148
You're taking me to your sister's
to answer for my imagined crimes.

116
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:34,235
Tell me, Lady Stark, when was
the last time you saw your sister?

117
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,988
- Five years ago.
- She's changed.

118
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:41,701
She was always a bit touched, but now...
You might as well kill me here.

119
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,996
- I am not a murderer, Lannister.
- Neither am I.

120
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,457
I had nothing to do with
the attempt on your son's life.

121
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:49,375
- The dagger found...
- What sort of imbecile

122
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,211
arms an assassin with his own blade?

123
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,421
- Should I gag him?
- Why?

124
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,423
Am I starting to make sense?

125
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,343
Rodrik!

126
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,848
My lady, this way.

127
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:22,408
Untie me.

128
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:25,453
If I die, what's the point?

129
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:32,210
Ah!

130
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:19,132
- Rodrik?
- I'll be fine, my lady.

131
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,260
There's no need to bloody yourself.

132
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:25,596
Your first?

133
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:28,808
You need a woman.

134
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,102
Nothing like a woman after a fight.

135
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,148
I'm willing if she is.

136
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,620
Bran.

137
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:53,499
The Iron Islands.
Sigil - a kraken.

138
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,710
Words - "We do not sow."

139
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,962
- Lords?
- The Greyjoys.

140
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:01,382
Famed for their skills at archery,
navigation and lovemaking.

141
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,303
And failed rebellions.

142
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:11,684
Sigil - a stag, a crowned stag
now that Robert's king.

143
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,812
- Good.
- Words - "Ours is the fury."

144
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,523
- Lords - the Baratheons.
- Mm-hm.

145
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,525
The Westerlands.

146
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,694
- Sigil - a lion.
- Mmm.

147
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,822
- Words - "A Lannister always pays his debts."
- No.

148
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:28,368
A common saying,
but not their official motto.

149
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:30,495
Lords - the Lannisters.

150
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,498
- We're still on their words.
- I don't know them.

151
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:35,541
You do know them. Think.

152
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,127
"Unbowed, unbent, unbroken."

153
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,880
- That's House Martell.
- "Righteous in wrath."

154
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:44,509
- House Hornwood.
- "Family, duty, honor."

155
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:46,552
Those are Tully words - your mother's.

156
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:50,223
- Are we playing a game?
- Family, duty, honor...

157
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:52,558
- Is that the right order?
- You know it is.

158
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,685
Family comes first?

159
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,023
Your mother had to leave
Winterfell to protect the family.

160
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,609
How can she protect the family

161
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,028
if she's not with her family?

162
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:07,407
Your mother sat by your bed

163
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:10,243
for three weeks while you slept.

164
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:12,453
And then she left!

165
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:17,208
When you were born, I was the one
who pulled you from your mother.

166
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:21,295
I placed you in her arms.

167
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:25,216
From that moment until
the moment she dies,

168
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:28,761
she will love you.

169
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,555
Absolutely.

170
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,725
- Fiercely.
- Why did she leave?

171
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:36,686
I still can't tell you,

172
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:39,272
- but she will be home soon.
- Do you know where she is now?

173
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:40,982
Today?

174
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,776
- No, I don't.
- Then how can you promise me

175
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,903
she'll be home soon?

176
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:51,325
Sometimes I worry you're
too smart for your own good.

177
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:54,871
I'll never shoot another arrow.

178
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:58,374
And where is that written?

179
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:01,085
- You need legs to work a bow.
- Hmm.

180
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,713
If the saddle Lord Tyrion
designed actually works,

181
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:06,257
you could learn to shoot
a bow from horseback.

182
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,092
Really?

183
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,679
Dothraki boys learn when
they're four years old.

184
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,806
Why shouldn't you?

185
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:30,990
Shh, keep it down.

186
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,576
You're not supposed to be
inside the castle walls.

187
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,954
I thought you were supposed to be
an important person around here.

188
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,332
Important enough for the likes of you.

189
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,793
You're not the only nobleman
in my life, you know.

190
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:46,339
Who, the Imp?
I'd call him half a nobleman.

191
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:48,382
Jealous?

192
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,259
Why should I be jealous?

193
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:53,304
Anyone with a few coppers in his
pocket can own you for the night.

194
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,516
What's a dwarf like down below?

195
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:58,726
I've always wondered.

196
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,938
- Might surprise you.
- Hmm?

197
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:06,150
He's good with his fingers too.
And his tongue.

198
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,195
Generous tipper.

199
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,031
I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister.

200
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,033
You are jealous.

201
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,785
I'm a Greyjoy.

202
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,037
We've been lords of the
Iron Islands for 300 years.

203
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,957
There's not a family in Westeros
that can look down on us,

204
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:23,000
not even the Lannisters.

205
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,127
And what about the Starks?

206
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:29,340
I've been Lord Stark's ward
since I was eight years old.

207
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:32,885
A ward - that's a nice word for it.

208
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,846
Your father rebelled against
King Robert and if he does it again...

209
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:39,141
My father fought for
the freedom of his people.

210
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:42,895
What did your father do?
Fucked a cook and whelped a whore.

211
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,523
You're a very serious boy.

212
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:48,818
- I'm not a boy.
- Oh, yes, you are.

213
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:53,823
A serious boy with a serious cock.

214
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:56,242
I don't want to pay for it.

215
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:59,036
Then get yourself a wife.

216
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,542
Come on.

217
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,170
I'm not gonna hurt you.

218
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:17,847
How is your son, my lord?

219
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:20,725
He'll never walk again.

220
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,687
But his mind is sound?

221
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:27,648
So they say.

222
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,900
A blessing, then.

223
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:34,196
I suffered an early mutilation myself.

224
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,576
Some doors close forever...

225
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:42,872
others open in most unexpected places.

226
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,750
May I?

227
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:53,257
If the wrong ears heard
what I'm about to tell you,

228
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,468
off comes my head.

229
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:58,179
And who would mourn poor Varys then?

230
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:01,932
North or South, they sing
no songs for spiders.

231
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,435
But there are things you must know.

232
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,938
You are the King's Hand
and the king is a fool -

233
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:12,818
your friend, I know, but a fool -
and doomed unless you save him.

234
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:15,446
I've been in the capital a month.

235
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,367
Why have you waited
so long to tell me this?

236
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,243
I didn't trust you.

237
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:23,704
So why do you trust me now?

238
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:28,626
The queen is not the only one who
has been watching you closely.

239
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:30,878
There are few men
of honor in the capital.

240
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,713
You are one of them.

241
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:36,759
I would like to believe I am another,
strange as that may seem.

242
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,470
What sort of doom does the king face?

243
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:42,306
The same sort as Jon Arryn.

244
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:46,394
The tears of Lys, they call it.

245
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,813
A rare and costly thing,

246
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:52,441
as clear and tasteless as water.
It leaves no trace.

247
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:03,536
Who gave it to him?

248
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:06,706
Some dear friend, no doubt.
But which one?

249
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:11,085
There were many.
Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man.

250
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,337
There was one boy.

251
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,965
All he was he owed to Jon Arryn.

252
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,051
The squire, Ser Hugh?

253
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,097
Pity, what happened to him,

254
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,350
just when his life seemed
to be going so nicely.

255
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,563
If Ser Hugh poisoned him...

256
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:34,066
who paid Ser Hugh?

257
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:39,572
- Someone who could afford it.
- Jon was a man of peace.

258
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:43,200
He was Hand for 17 years - 17 good years.

259
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,119
Why kill him?

260
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:49,373
He started asking questions.

261
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,696
He's found one bastard already.

262
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:22,948
He has the book.

263
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,992
The rest will come.

264
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,453
And when he knows the truth,
what will he do?

265
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:29,288
The gods alone know.

266
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:32,416
The fools tried to kill his son.

267
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,211
What's worse - they botched it.

268
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:40,466
The wolf and the lion will be
at each other's throats.

269
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:44,303
- We will be at war soon, my friend.
- What good is war now?

270
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,472
We're not ready.

271
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:49,141
If one Hand can die, why not a second?

272
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,852
This Hand is not the other.

273
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,562
We need time.

274
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:56,816
Khal Drogo will not make his
move until his son is born.

275
00:21:56,941 --> 00:22:00,277
- You know what these savages are.
- "Delay," you say.

276
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,363
"Move fast," I reply.

277
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:05,783
This is no longer a game for two players.

278
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:07,910
It never was.

279
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,516
The first to arrive
and the last to leave.

280
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:34,144
I admire your industry.

281
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,897
You do move quietly.

282
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,483
We all have our qualities.

283
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,570
You look a bit lonely today.

284
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,989
You should pay a visit
to my brothel this evening.

285
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:47,575
- First boy is on the house.
- I think you're mistaking

286
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,578
- business with pleasure.
- Am I?

287
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:56,333
All those birds that whisper in your
ear - such pretty little things.

288
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:59,920
Trust me,

289
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,673
we accommodate all inclinations.

290
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:07,803
Oh, I'm sure. Lord Redwyne likes
his boys very young, I hear.

291
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:12,725
I'm a purveyor of beauty and
discretion - both equally important.

292
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:17,479
Though I suppose beauty
is a subjective quality, no?

293
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:22,067
Is it true that Ser Marlon
of Tumblestone prefers amputees?

294
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:24,904
All desires are valid
to a man with a full purse.

295
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:28,407
And I heard the most awful
rumor about a certain lord

296
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,534
with a taste for fresh cadavers.

297
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:34,872
Must be enormously difficult
to accommodate that inclination.

298
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:36,916
The logistics alone...

299
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:40,252
to find beautiful corpses
before they rot.

300
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:44,465
Strictly speaking, such a thing would not
be in accordance with the king's laws.

301
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,009
Strictly speaking.

302
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:54,725
Tell me. Does someone somewhere
keep your balls in a little box?

303
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:58,228
I've often wondered.

304
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,440
Do you know, I have
no idea where they are.

305
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:05,277
And we had been so close.

306
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,112
But enough about me.
How have you been

307
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,281
since we last saw each other?

308
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,951
Since you last saw me
or since I last saw you?

309
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:15,412
Now the last time I saw you,
you were talking to the Hand of the King.

310
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:18,290
- Saw me with your own eyes?
- Eyes I own.

311
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:19,959
Council business.

312
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:23,087
We all have so much
to discuss with Ned Stark.

313
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:28,175
Everyone's well aware of your enduring
fondness for Lord Stark's wife.

314
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:32,680
If the Lannisters were behind
the attempt on the Stark boy's life

315
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:38,143
and it was discovered that you helped
the Starks come to that conclusion...

316
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:41,271
to think a simple word to the queen...

317
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:43,649
- One shudders at the thought.
- Ooh.

318
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:46,235
But you know something?
I do believe that I have seen you

319
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,278
even more recently than you have seen me.

320
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:51,156
- Have you?
- Yes.

321
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,992
Earlier today, I distinctly recall

322
00:24:53,117 --> 00:24:55,494
seeing you talking to Lord Stark in his chambers.

323
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,746
Was that you under the bed?

324
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,790
And not long after that

325
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:02,543
when I saw you escorting a certain

326
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,713
foreign dignitary...

327
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:08,215
Council business?

328
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,510
Of course, you would have friends
from across the Narrow Sea.

329
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:14,221
You're from there yourself, after all.

330
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:17,474
We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys?

331
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,810
I'd like to think we are.

332
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:22,146
So you can imagine my burden,

333
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:25,899
wondering if the king might
question my friend's sympathies.

334
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:29,987
To stand at a crossroads where
turning left means loyalty to a friend,

335
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,905
turning right loyalty to the realm...

336
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:34,366
- Oh, please.
- To find myself in a position

337
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:36,410
where a simple word to the king...

338
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,620
What are you two conspiring about?

339
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:42,041
Well, whatever it is,
you'd best hurry up.

340
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:45,210
- My brother is coming.
- To a small council meeting?

341
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:48,213
Disturbing news from far away.

342
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,842
Hadn't you heard?

343
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,873
Off with you. No begging.

344
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,875
I'm not a beggar.
I live here.

345
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,127
D'you want a smack on your ear
to help you with your hearing?

346
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,088
I want to see my father.

347
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:31,924
I want to fuck the queen,
for all the good it does me.

348
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:33,759
You want your father, boy?

349
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:37,971
He's lying on the floor of some tavern,
getting pissed on by his friends.

350
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:40,557
My father is Hand of the King!

351
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:43,185
I'm not a boy.
I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell.

352
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:46,688
And if you lay a hand on me, my father
will have both your heads on spikes.

353
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:49,775
Now are you going to let me by
or do I need to smack you

354
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,402
on the ear to help with your hearing?

355
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:57,032
You know I had half my guard
out searching for you?

356
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:03,747
- You promised me this would stop.
- They said they were going to kill you.

357
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,542
- Who did?
- I didn't see them,

358
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:08,460
- but I think one was fat.
- Oh, Arya.

359
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:11,171
I'm not lying!
They said you found the bastard

360
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:14,174
and the wolves are fighting
the lions and the savage...

361
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,009
Something about the savage.

362
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:18,470
- Where did you hear this?
- In the dungeons,

363
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:21,765
- near the dragon skulls.
- What were you doing in the dungeons?

364
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:24,977
Chasing a cat.

365
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:28,814
Pardon, my lord.

366
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:32,192
There's a night's watchman here
begging a word. Says it's urgent.

367
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:42,119
- Your name, friend?
- Yoren, if it please.

368
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:46,290
- This must be your son. He has the look.
- I'm a girl!

369
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:48,000
Did Benjen send you?

370
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:52,129
No one sent me, my lord.
I'm here to find men for the Wall,

371
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:55,799
see if there's any scum in the dungeons
that might be fit for service.

372
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:58,552
- Oh, we'll find recruits for you.
- Thank you, my lord.

373
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,971
But that's not why I disturb you now.

374
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:05,100
Your brother Benjen, his blood runs black -

375
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,269
makes him as much my brother as yours.

376
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:12,816
It's for his sake I rode here so hard
I damn near killed my horse.

377
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,610
There are others riding too.

378
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:17,196
The whole city will know by tomorrow.

379
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:19,698
Know what?

380
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:22,326
Best said in private, my lord.

381
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,001
Go on. We'll talk more later.

382
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:34,087
Jory, take her safely to her room.

383
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:36,673
Come along, my lady.
You heard your father.

384
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:47,434
- How many guards does my father have?
- Here in King's Landing? Fifty.

385
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,145
You wouldn't let anyone
kill him, would you?

386
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,981
No fear on that count, little lady.

387
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:01,073
- Well?
- It's about your wife, my lord.

388
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,202
She's taken the Imp.

389
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:23,262
You're far from home, Lady Stark.

390
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:27,933
- To whom do I speak?
- Ser Vardis Egan, knight of the Vale.

391
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:32,187
- Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?
- There was no time to send word.

392
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:34,481
May I ask, my lady,

393
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,400
why he is with you?

394
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:39,152
That's why there was no time.

395
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:41,947
- He is my prisoner.
- He doesn't look like a prisoner.

396
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:45,242
My sister will decide what he looks like.

397
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:49,037
Yes, my lady. She will at that.

398
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:58,463
The Eyrie. They say it's impregnable.

399
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:02,217
Give me ten good men
and some climbing spikes,

400
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:04,553
I'll impregnate the bitch.

401
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:07,389
I like you.

402
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:19,234
Lord Stark, your presence
has been requested

403
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,653
in the small council chamber.
A meeting has been called.

404
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:23,864
I need to see the king first - alone.

405
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:26,241
The king is at the small
council meeting, my lord.

406
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:28,327
He has summoned you.

407
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:31,330
- Is it about my wife?
- No, my lord.

408
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:34,124
I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen.

409
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:38,503
- The whore is pregnant.
- You're speaking of murdering a child.

410
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:41,048
I warned you this would happen,
back in the North.

411
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:43,759
I warned you, but you didn't care to hear.

412
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:46,136
Well, hear it now.

413
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:49,681
I want 'em dead, mother and child both.

414
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,850
And that fool Viserys as well.

415
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:55,354
Is that plain enough for you?
I want them both dead.

416
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:58,023
You will dishonor yourself
forever if you do this.

417
00:30:58,148 --> 00:31:01,693
Honor?! I've got seven kingdoms to rule!

418
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:04,905
One king, seven kingdoms.

419
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,282
Do you think honor keeps them in line?

420
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,493
Do you think it's honor
that's keeping the peace?

421
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:13,997
- It's fear - fear and blood.
- Then we're no better than the Mad King.

422
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:18,377
- Careful, Ned. Careful now.
- You want to assassinate a girl

423
00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:20,087
because the spider heard a rumor?

424
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:22,964
No rumor, my lord.
The princess is with child.

425
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:26,385
- Based on whose information?
- Ser Jorah Mormont.

426
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,720
He is serving as advisor
to the Targaryens.

427
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:31,264
Mormont? You bring us the whispers

428
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:34,935
of a traitor half a world
away and call it fact?

429
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,729
Jorah Mormont's a slaver, not a traitor.

430
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:40,232
Small difference, I know,
to an honorable man.

431
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:43,985
He broke the law, betrayed
his family, fled our land.

432
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:46,154
We commit murder on the word of this man?

433
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:49,866
And if he's right?
If she has a son?

434
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:53,286
A Targaryen at the head
of a Dothraki army -

435
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:57,249
- what then?
- The Narrow Sea still lies between us.

436
00:31:57,374 --> 00:32:01,461
I'll fear the Dothraki the day they
teach their horses to run on water.

437
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,505
Do nothing?

438
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,924
That's your wise advice?

439
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:09,594
Do nothing till our enemies
are on our shores?

440
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:11,805
You're my council.
Counsel!

441
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:15,600
Speak sense to this honorable fool.

442
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:19,604
I understand your misgivings, my lord.

443
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:22,315
Truly, I do. It is a terrible thing

444
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:24,443
we must consider, a vile thing.

445
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:26,778
Yet we who presume to rule

446
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,947
must sometimes do vile things

447
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,283
for the good of the realm.

448
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:34,744
Should the gods grant Daenerys a son,

449
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:38,707
- the realm will bleed.
- I bear this girl no ill will,

450
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:42,627
but should the Dothraki invade,
how many innocents will die?

451
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,088
How many towns will burn?

452
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:48,467
Is it not wiser, kinder even,

453
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:53,763
that she should die now so that
tens of thousands might live?

454
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:56,475
We should have had them
both killed years ago.

455
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,810
When you find yourself
in bed with an ugly woman,

456
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:02,189
best close your eyes, get it over with.

457
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:05,442
Cut her throat.
Be done with it.

458
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:14,493
I followed you into war -

459
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:16,620
twice,

460
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:18,538
without doubts,

461
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,665
without second thoughts.

462
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,585
But I will not follow you now.

463
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:26,588
The Robert I grew up with

464
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:30,133
didn't tremble at the shadow
of an unborn child.

465
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:34,012
She dies.

466
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:37,349
I will have no part in it.

467
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:39,684
You're the King's Hand, Lord Stark.

468
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:43,271
You'll do as I command
or I'll find me a Hand who will.

469
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:54,449
And good luck to him.

470
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:58,328
- I thought you were a better man.
- Out. Out, damn you.

471
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,121
I'm done with you.

472
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:04,292
Go, run back to Winterfell!

473
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,753
I'll have your head on a spike!

474
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:11,049
I'll put it there myself, you fool!

475
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,051
You think you're too good for this?

476
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:16,096
Too proud and honorable?
This is a war!

477
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:22,060
I'll go ahead with my daughters.
Get them ready. Do it yourself.

478
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:24,980
- Don't ask anyone for help.
- Right away, my lord.

479
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:27,649
Lord Baelish is here for you.

480
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:31,319
His Grace went on about
you at some length

481
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:35,282
after you took your leave.
The word "treason" was mentioned.

482
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:40,161
- What can I do for you?
- When do you return to Winterfell?

483
00:34:40,287 --> 00:34:43,164
- Why? What do you care?
- If you're still here come nightfall,

484
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:46,960
I'll take you to see the last person
Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill.

485
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,546
If that sort of thing still interests you.

486
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:52,257
I don't have the time.

487
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:55,427
It won't take more than an hour.
But as you please.

488
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:04,060
Round up all the men we have and
station them outside the girls' chambers.

489
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,647
- Who are your best two swords?
- Heward and Wyl.

490
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:10,900
Find them and meet me at the stables.

491
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:18,325
You bring him here without permission?

492
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,244
You pollute my home with his presence?

493
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:28,710
Your aunt has done a bad thing,
Robin, a very bad thing.

494
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,337
You remember her, don't you?

495
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,715
Isn't he beautiful?

496
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,843
And strong too. Jon knew it.

497
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,804
His last words were "The seed is strong."

498
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:42,390
He wanted everyone to know
what a good, strong boy

499
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:45,018
his son would grow up to be.

500
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:48,271
Look at him, the lord of all the Vale.

501
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,649
Lysa,

502
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:53,151
you wrote me about the Lannisters,

503
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:56,279
- warning me...
- To stay away from them!

504
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,990
Not to bring one here!

505
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:01,368
Mummy...

506
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:04,496
- is that the bad man?
- It is.

507
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:08,958
He's little.

508
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:11,211
He's Tyrion the Imp, of House Lannister.

509
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:15,256
He killed your father.
He murdered the Hand of the King!

510
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:17,842
Oh, did I kill him too?

511
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:22,097
- I've been a very busy man.
- You will watch your tongue!

512
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:25,016
These men are knights of the Vale.

513
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,769
Every one of them loved Jon Arryn.

514
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,813
Every one of them would die for me.

515
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:33,358
If any harm comes to me,
my brother Jaime will see that they do.

516
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:36,361
You can't hurt us.
No one can hurt us here. Tell him, Mummy!

517
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:40,281
- Tell him!
- Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh, my sweet boy.

518
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:44,828
He's just trying to frighten us.
Lannisters are all liars.

519
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:47,664
No one will hurt my baby.

520
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:49,457
Mummy...

521
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:53,002
I want to see the bad man fly.

522
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:58,425
- Perhaps you will, my little love.
- This man is my prisoner.

523
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:01,970
I will not have him harmed.

524
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,098
Ser Vardis,

525
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:07,976
my sister's guest is weary.

526
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:10,687
Take him down below so he can rest.

527
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:13,690
Introduce him to Mord.

528
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,611
You go sleep, dwarf man.

529
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:20,780
Sleep good, little dwarf man!

530
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:58,943
Lord Stark's lucky he still has a head.

531
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:01,696
Robert will rant for a few days,
but he won't do anything.

532
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:04,908
- He adores the man.
- You're jealous.

533
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:08,620
- Are you sure this won't hurt?
- Only if I slip.

534
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:16,044
- And you'd prefer me like this?
- Mm-hm.

535
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:18,630
If you want hairless, maybe
you should find a little boy.

536
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:20,757
I want you.

537
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,928
My brother thinks that anyone who
hasn't been to war isn't a man.

538
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:27,472
He treats me as if I'm a spoilt child.

539
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,767
Oh, and you're not?

540
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,978
Loras Tyrell, the Knight of the Flowers?

541
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:36,272
How many wars have you fought in?

542
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:39,651
Oh, and how much did your father
spend on that armor of yours?

543
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:41,611
Hold still.

544
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:45,657
All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis
is how I'm not tough enough,

545
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:47,534
how I squirm at the sight of blood.

546
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:50,286
You did vomit when that boy's eye
was knocked out in the melee.

547
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:52,330
His eye was dangling out
of the damn socket!

548
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:55,041
He shouldn't have entered the melee
if he didn't know how to fight.

549
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:58,336
Easy for you to say.
Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman.

550
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:00,880
It's not a gift.
No one gave it to me.

551
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,841
I'm good because I work at it -

552
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:05,718
every day of my life
since I could hold a stick.

553
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:09,889
I could work at fighting all day, every day,
I'd still never be as good as you.

554
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,433
Yes, well, I guess we'll never know.

555
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:24,946
- Everywhere?
- Everywhere.

556
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:27,323
So how did it end up?

557
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:32,495
- The Targaryen girl will die?
- It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is.

558
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,622
Robert's rather tasteless about it.

559
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:38,251
Every time he talks about killing her,
I swear the table rises six inches.

560
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,212
It's a shame he can't muster
the same enthusiasm for his wife.

561
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:43,715
He does have a deep,
abiding lust for her money.

562
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,217
You have to give it
to the Lannisters - they may be

563
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:49,596
the most pompous, ponderous cunts
the gods ever suffered to walk the world,

564
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:52,348
but they do have outrageous
amounts of money.

565
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:57,645
- I have an outrageous amount of money.
- Not as much as the Lannisters.

566
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:01,149
But a lot more than you.

567
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:04,569
Robert's threatening to take
me hunting with him.

568
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:06,696
Last time we were
out there for two weeks.

569
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:09,240
Tramping through the trees
in the rain, day after day,

570
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:12,410
all so he can stick his spear
into something's flesh.

571
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:15,872
Oh. But Robert loves his killing.

572
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:17,916
- And he's the king.
- Hmm.

573
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:21,544
- How did that ever happen?
- Because he loves his killing.

574
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,713
And he used to be good at it.

575
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:27,050
Do you know who should be king?

576
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:29,427
- Be serious.
- I am.

577
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:31,721
My father could be your bank.

578
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,765
I've never fought in a war before,

579
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:36,601
- but I'd fight for you.
- I'm fourth in line.

580
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:39,729
And where's Robert in the line
of royal succession?

581
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:42,106
Joffrey is a monster.
Tommen is eight.

582
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:44,776
- Stannis?
- Stannis has the personality of a lobster.

583
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:46,986
He's still my older brother.

584
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,530
- What are you doing?!
- Look at it.

585
00:40:49,656 --> 00:40:51,783
- You cut me.
- It's just blood. We've all got it in us.

586
00:40:51,908 --> 00:40:54,202
Sometimes a little spills.

587
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:57,497
If you become king,
you're going to see a lot of this.

588
00:40:57,622 --> 00:40:59,791
You need to get used to it.

589
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:01,918
Go on. Look.

590
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,047
People love you.

591
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:09,550
They love to serve you
because you're kind to them.

592
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:12,136
They want to be near you.

593
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:17,183
You're willing to do
what needs to be done,

594
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:20,478
but you don't gloat over it.

595
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,355
You don't love killing.

596
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:30,113
Where is it written that power
is the sole province of the worst?

597
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:34,993
That thrones are only made
for the hated and the feared?

598
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:40,540
You would be a wonderful king.

599
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:01,686
I'm sorry your marriage
to Ned Stark didn't work out.

600
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:03,396
You seemed so good together.

601
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:06,816
I'm glad I could do something
to make you happy.

602
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:12,780
Without a Hand, everything will fall to pieces.

603
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:17,577
I suppose this is where you tell me
to give the job to your brother Jaime.

604
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:19,120
No.

605
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:21,247
He's not serious enough.

606
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:25,376
I'll say this for Ned Stark -
he's serious enough.

607
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:26,544
Hmm.

608
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:30,256
Was it really worth it?
Losing him this way?

609
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,216
I don't know.

610
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:36,471
But I do know this -

611
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:42,727
if the Targaryen girl convinces
her horselord husband to invade

612
00:42:42,852 --> 00:42:46,105
and the Dothraki horde
crosses the Narrow Sea...

613
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:49,901
we won't be able to stop them.

614
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:52,361
The Dothraki don't sail.
Every child knows that.

615
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:55,698
They don't have discipline.
They don't have armor.

616
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:59,285
- They don't have siege weapons.
- It's a neat little trick you do -

617
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:02,413
you move your lips and your
father's voice comes out.

618
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:05,541
Is my father wrong?

619
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:11,923
Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands

620
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:15,635
with 40,000 Dothraki screamers at his back.

621
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,096
We hole up in our castles.

622
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:19,931
A wise move -

623
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:23,726
only a fool would meet
the Dothraki in an open field.

624
00:43:24,477 --> 00:43:26,646
They leave us in our castles.

625
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:30,233
They go from town to town,
looting and burning,

626
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:34,112
killing every man who can't
hide behind a stone wall,

627
00:43:34,237 --> 00:43:36,739
stealing all our crops and livestock,

628
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:39,742
enslaving all our women and children.

629
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:42,286
How long do the people of the
Seven Kingdoms stand behind

630
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:45,665
their absentee king, their cowardly king

631
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:48,209
hiding behind high walls?

632
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:51,129
When do the people decide
that Viserys Targaryen

633
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:53,631
is the rightful monarch after all?

634
00:43:55,258 --> 00:43:57,426
We still outnumber them.

635
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:02,098
Which is the bigger number - five or one?

636
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:04,600
Five.

637
00:44:05,685 --> 00:44:07,478
Five...

638
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:11,399
One.

639
00:44:11,524 --> 00:44:13,693
One army - a real army

640
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:17,655
united behind one leader
with one purpose.

641
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:23,452
Our purpose died with the Mad King.

642
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:25,705
Now we've got as many armies

643
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:29,709
as there are men with gold in their purse.

644
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:31,794
And everybody wants something different.

645
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:34,130
Your father wants to own the world.

646
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:37,508
Ned Stark wants to run away
and bury his head in the snow.

647
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:39,635
What do you want?

648
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:53,274
We haven't had a real fight in nine years.

649
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:55,484
Backstabbing doesn't
prepare you for a fight.

650
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:57,653
And that's all the realm is now -

651
00:44:57,778 --> 00:44:59,864
backstabbing and scheming

652
00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:02,992
and arse-licking and money-grubbing.

653
00:45:03,993 --> 00:45:06,787
Sometimes I don't know
what holds it together.

654
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:10,917
Our marriage.

655
00:45:19,175 --> 00:45:21,677
Ah, so here we sit,

656
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:26,515
17 years later, holding it all together.

657
00:45:28,017 --> 00:45:30,102
Don't you get tired?

658
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:32,688
Every day.

659
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:36,901
How long can hate hold a thing together?

660
00:45:37,026 --> 00:45:40,988
Well, 17 years is quite a long time.

661
00:45:41,948 --> 00:45:43,616
Yes, it is.

662
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:45,993
Yes, it is.

663
00:45:51,499 --> 00:45:53,960
What was she like?

664
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:58,172
You've never asked about her, not once.

665
00:45:58,297 --> 00:45:59,757
Why not?

666
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:04,428
At first, just saying her
name even in private

667
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:07,682
felt like I was breathing
life back into her.

668
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:12,603
I thought if I didn't talk about her,
she'd just fade away for you.

669
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:15,564
When I realized that wasn't
going to happen,

670
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:17,692
I refused to ask out of spite.

671
00:46:18,651 --> 00:46:23,364
I didn't want to give you the satisfaction
of thinking I cared enough to ask.

672
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:26,742
And eventually it became clear that
my spite didn't mean anything to you.

673
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:29,745
As far as I could tell,
you actually enjoyed it.

674
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:31,831
So why now?

675
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:37,962
What harm could Lyanna Stark's
ghost do to either of us

676
00:46:38,087 --> 00:46:41,215
that we haven't done to each other
a hundred times over?

677
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,096
You want to know the horrible truth?

678
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:52,351
I can't even remember
what she looked like.

679
00:46:55,938 --> 00:47:00,609
I only know she was the one thing
I ever wanted.

680
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:05,114
Someone took her away from me,

681
00:47:06,449 --> 00:47:10,536
and seven kingdoms couldn't
fill the hole she left behind.

682
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:16,959
I felt something for you once, you know?

683
00:47:18,294 --> 00:47:20,046
I know.

684
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:22,923
Even after we lost our first boy.

685
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:26,802
For quite a while, actually.

686
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:35,561
Was it ever possible for us?
Was there ever a time, ever a moment?

687
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:43,944
No.

688
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:51,494
Does that make you feel better or worse?

689
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:58,292
It doesn't make me feel anything.

690
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:14,767
She looks like him,

691
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:16,811
don't she, my lord?

692
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:19,855
She has his nose, his black hair.

693
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:22,400
Aye.

694
00:48:22,525 --> 00:48:24,485
Tell him when you see him, my lord.

695
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:28,864
If it please you, tell him
how beautiful she is.

696
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:34,161
- I will.
- And tell him I've been with no one else.

697
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:37,706
I swear it, my lord,
by the old gods and new.

698
00:48:37,832 --> 00:48:39,917
I don't want no jewels or nothing,

699
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:41,752
just him.

700
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:43,462
The king was always good to me.

701
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:45,714
When Jon Arryn came to visit you,

702
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:49,969
- what did he want?
- He wasn't that sort of man, my lord.

703
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:52,888
He just wanted to know
if the child was happy,

704
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:55,015
healthy.

705
00:48:57,852 --> 00:48:59,854
Looks healthy enough to me.

706
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:03,899
The girl shall want for nothing.

707
00:49:09,989 --> 00:49:12,408
Brothels make a much better
investment than ships,

708
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:14,118
I've found.

709
00:49:14,243 --> 00:49:16,579
Whores rarely sink.

710
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:23,711
What do you know of
King Robert's bastards?

711
00:49:23,836 --> 00:49:27,256
Well, he has more than you, for a start.

712
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:29,967
- How many?
- Does it matter?

713
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:32,928
If you fuck enough women,
some of them will give you presents.

714
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:34,972
And Jon Arryn tracked them all down. Why?

715
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:37,975
He was the King's Hand.
Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after.

716
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:41,228
He was overcome with fatherly love.

717
00:49:44,273 --> 00:49:45,774
Come.

718
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:54,158
- Jory!
- My lord.

719
00:50:13,219 --> 00:50:15,221
Such a small pack of wolves.

720
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:19,141
Stay back, ser.
This is the Hand of the King.

721
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:21,185
Was the Hand of the King.

722
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:25,231
Now I'm not sure what he is -
lord of somewhere very far away.

723
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:27,525
What's the meaning of this, Lannister?

724
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:31,862
Get back inside where it's safe.
I'm looking for my brother.

725
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:33,697
You remember my brother,
don't you, Lord Stark?

726
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:37,910
Blond hair, sharp tongue, short man.

727
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:42,206
- I remember him well.
- It seems he had some trouble on the road.

728
00:50:42,331 --> 00:50:45,125
You wouldn't know what
happened to him, would you?

729
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:49,547
He was taken at my command
to answer for his crimes.

730
00:50:49,672 --> 00:50:52,216
My lords!

731
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:54,843
I'll bring the City Watch.

732
00:50:56,679 --> 00:51:00,266
Come, Stark.
I'd rather you die sword in hand.

733
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:02,351
- If you threaten my lord again...
- Threaten?

734
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:05,396
As in, "I'm going to open your lord

735
00:51:05,521 --> 00:51:09,108
"from balls to brains and see
what Starks are made of"?

736
00:51:09,525 --> 00:51:12,069
You kill me,

737
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:14,655
your brother's a dead man.

738
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,490
You're right.

739
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:19,326
Take him alive. Kill his men.

740
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:29,605
Yah!

741
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:58,092
My brother, Lord Stark -
we want him back.
