1
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:01,788
Yah! Left high, left low.

2
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,516
Right low, lunge right.

3
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,397
You break anything,
the septa will have my head.

4
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,900
What is...

5
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:43,038
Your sister knew perfectly well
we were to leave today.

6
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,207
- How she could forget...
- She didn't forget.

7
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:47,876
She's with her dancing master.
She's with him every morning.

8
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,712
She always comes back with scrapes
and bruises. She's so clumsy.

9
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,048
Hush!

10
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,676
Go back to your room.

11
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:59,221
Bar the doors and do not open them
for anyone you do not know.

12
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:02,265
- What is it? What's happening?
- Do as I told you.

13
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:04,393
Run!

14
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,648
This way!

15
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,580
Left, right. Rah!

16
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:28,917
- Now you are dead.
- You said right,

17
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,711
but you went left.

18
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:34,464
- And now you are a dead girl.
- Only 'cause you lied.

19
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:38,719
My tongue lied.
My eyes shouted the truth.

20
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:42,097
- You were not seeing.
- I was so. I watched, but you...

21
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:46,351
Watching is not seeing, dead girl.

22
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:52,107
The seeing, the true seeing,

23
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,609
that is the heart of swordplay.

24
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:02,993
Arya Stark, come with us.
Your father wants to see you.

25
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:09,291
And why is it that Lord Eddard
is sending Lannister men

26
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,001
in place of his own?

27
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:14,629
- I am wondering.
- Mind your place, dancing master.

28
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:18,925
- This is no concern of yours.
- My father wouldn't send you.

29
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,265
And I don't have to go
with you if I don't want.

30
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,642
Take her.

31
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:31,646
Are you men or snakes,
that you would threaten a child?

32
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,940
Get out of my way, little man.

33
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:37,277
I am Syrio Forel...

34
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,279
Foreign bastard.

35
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:45,827
...and you will be speaking
to me with more respect.

36
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:49,289
Kill the Braavosi. Bring the girl.

37
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:53,668
Arya child, we are done
with dancing for the day.

38
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:56,254
Run to your father.

39
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,859
Bloody oafs.

40
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,073
- Begone now, Arya.
- Come with me. Run.

41
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:27,661
The first sword of Braavos does not run.

42
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:41,842
What do we say

43
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:44,427
to the god of death?

44
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,263
Not today.

45
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,016
Go.

46
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:16,251
Not today. Not today.

47
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:29,472
Stay away from me.
I'll tell my father.

48
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,309
I'll... I'll tell the queen.

49
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:36,021
Who do you think sent me?

50
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,119
Needle.

51
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,665
There she is.

52
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,084
- What do you want?
- I want you, wolf girl.

53
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,794
- Come here.
- Leave me be.

54
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,590
- My father's a lord. He'll reward you.
- She'll reward me - the queen!

55
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,259
Stay away!

56
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:38,291
Lord Stark, you must be thirsty.

57
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:41,962
Varys.

58
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,216
I promise you it isn't poisoned.

59
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,428
Why is it no one ever trusts the eunuch?

60
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,355
Not so much, my lord.

61
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,649
I would save the rest, if I were you.

62
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:06,611
Hide it. Men have been known
to die of thirst in these cells.

63
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,657
What about my daughters?

64
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:13,159
The younger one seems
to have escaped the castle.

65
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,870
Even my little birds cannot find her.

66
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:19,207
- And Sansa?
- Still engaged to Joffrey.

67
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:23,211
Cersei will keep her close.
The rest of your household though...

68
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:27,173
all dead, it grieves me to say.
I do so hate the sight of blood.

69
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,678
You watched my men being
slaughtered and did nothing.

70
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:34,097
And would again, my lord.

71
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:38,393
I was unarmed, unarmored and
surrounded by Lannister swords.

72
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,646
When you look at me do you see a hero?

73
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,195
What madness led you to tell the queen

74
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,824
you had learned the truth
about Joffrey's birth?

75
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,161
The madness of mercy.

76
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:02,584
- That she might save her children.
- Ah, the children.

77
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,920
It's always the innocents who suffer.

78
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:09,090
It wasn't the wine that killed
Robert, nor the boar.

79
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:12,552
The wine slowed him down
and the boar ripped him open,

80
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:16,056
but it was your mercy
that killed the king.

81
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:22,812
I trust you know you're
a dead man, Lord Eddard?

82
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:31,696
The queen can't kill me.
Cat holds her brother.

83
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:36,326
The wrong brother, sadly.
And lost to her.

84
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:39,329
Your wife has let the Imp
slip through her fingers.

85
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,710
If that's true,

86
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,881
then slit my throat and be done with it.

87
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,008
Not today, my lord.

88
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,764
Tell me something, Varys.

89
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,600
Who do you truly serve?

90
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,521
The realm, my lord.

91
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,648
Someone must.

92
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,628
It's Othor, without a doubt.

93
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:34,175
The other one is Jafer Flowers, my lord,
less the hand the wolf tore off.

94
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,720
Any sign of Benjen or
the rest of his party?

95
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:41,808
Just these two, my lord.
Been dead awhile, I'd say.

96
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:44,602
- Mmm.
- The smell.

97
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,648
What smell?

98
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:52,694
There is none.

99
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:56,489
If they'd been dead for a long time,
wouldn't there be rot?

100
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:01,494
- We should burn them.
- Snow's not wrong, my lord.

101
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,872
Fire will do for them.
The wildling way.

102
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,458
I want Maester Aemon
to examine them first.

103
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:12,672
You may be a coward, Tarly,
but you're not stupid.

104
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:16,634
- Get them inside.
- You heard him.

105
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:19,971
Lord Commander,

106
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,808
Maester Aemon awaits
you in his chambers...

107
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,686
A raven from King's Landing.

108
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,272
Come on, move 'em out.

109
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,702
Bring me a horn of ale, Snow,

110
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,997
and pour one for yourself.

111
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:58,384
The king is dead.

112
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,024
Is there any word of my father?

113
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,151
Sit.

114
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,408
Lord Stark has been

115
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,244
charged with treason.

116
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:28,122
They say he conspired
with Robert's brothers

117
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:31,167
to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.

118
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:46,224
I hope you're not thinking
of doing anything stupid.

119
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:49,769
Your duty lies here now.

120
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:52,730
My sisters were in King's Landing too.

121
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,235
I'm sure they'll be

122
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,028
treated gently.

123
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:06,035
Your father has proved to be
an awful traitor, dear.

124
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,038
King Robert's body was still warm

125
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:13,251
when Lord Eddard began plotting
to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.

126
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:15,837
He wouldn't do that.

127
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:18,631
He knows how much I love Joffrey.
He wouldn't.

128
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:21,676
Please, Your Grace,
there's been a mistake.

129
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:25,346
Send for my father. He'll tell
you - the king was his friend.

130
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:29,350
Sansa sweetling, you are innocent
of any wrong. We know that.

131
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,936
Yet you are the daughter of a traitor.

132
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,314
How can I allow you to marry my son?

133
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,317
A child born of a traitor's seed

134
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,736
is no fit consort for our king.

135
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:42,322
She is a sweet thing now, Your Grace,

136
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:46,868
but in 10 years who knows
what treasons she may hatch?

137
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,996
No, I'm not. I'll be a good
wife to him, you'll see.

138
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:54,500
I'll be a queen just like you, I promise.
I won't hatch anything.

139
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,212
The girl is innocent, Your Grace.

140
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:02,342
She should be given a chance
to prove her loyalty.

141
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:13,019
Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn
and your brother, the eldest,

142
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:15,730
- what's his name?
- Robb.

143
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,983
Word of your father's arrest
will reach him soon, no doubt.

144
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:23,237
Best it comes from you.
If you would help your father,

145
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:26,574
urge your brother to keep the king's peace.

146
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,744
Tell him to come to King's Landing
and swear his fealty to Joffrey.

147
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:40,046
If... if I could see my father,
talk to him about...

148
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:44,050
You disappoint me, child.

149
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,553
We have told you of your father's treason.

150
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,889
Why would you want
to speak to a traitor?

151
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,892
I only meant that...

152
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,229
What will happen to him?

153
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,233
- That depends.
- On...

154
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,903
- On what?
- On your brother.

155
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,908
And on you.

156
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,043
Treason?

157
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,629
Sansa wrote this?

158
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,132
It is your sister's hand,
but the queen's words.

159
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:28,261
You are summoned to King's Landing
to swear fealty to the new king.

160
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:31,431
Joffrey puts my father in chains,
now he wants his arse kissed?

161
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,435
This is a royal command, my lord.

162
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,230
- If you should refuse to obey...
- I won't refuse.

163
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:43,359
His Grace summons me to King's Landing,
I'll go to King's Landing.

164
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:46,362
But not alone.

165
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:50,199
Call the banners.

166
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:53,661
All of them, my lord?

167
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,663
They've all sworn to defend
my father, have they not?

168
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,623
They have.

169
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,876
Now we see what their words are worth.

170
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,129
Yes.

171
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,764
Are you afraid?

172
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,644
I must be.

173
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,188
Good.

174
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:24,901
- Why is that good?
- It means you're not stupid.

175
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,176
You've had this since dawn?

176
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:53,679
He sent it to me, not you.

177
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,017
- I've only shown it to you as a courtesy.
- A courtesy?!

178
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,228
My husband has been taken prisoner.

179
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:03,731
- My son intends to declare war.
- A war?

180
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,192
Your son against the Lannisters?

181
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:10,738
You should go to him.
Teach him patience.

182
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,991
Ned rots in a dungeon
and you speak of patience?

183
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,661
He is your brother by law!

184
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:19,705
Does family mean nothing to you?

185
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,625
Family means everything to me.

186
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,460
And I will not risk Robin's life

187
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:27,255
to get caught up in another
of your husband's wars.

188
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,591
- I'm hungry.
- Hush now, darling.

189
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,510
You just ate.

190
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:35,429
You will not support us, then?
Do I understand you correctly?

191
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:39,225
- But I'm hungry!
- Soon, love, soon.

192
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,396
You're always welcome here, sister.

193
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:46,691
But if you're asking me to send
men from the Vale to fight...

194
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,901
That is what I ask.

195
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:52,863
Go on, sweet.

196
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,991
Time for your bath.

197
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:57,535
I'll feed you after.

198
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,125
If you fear for the safety of your son...

199
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,211
Of course I fear
for the safety of my son!

200
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,255
Are you an idiot?

201
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,799
They killed my husband.

202
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,260
You say they shoved
your boy from a window.

203
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:18,889
- These people will do anything.
- And that is why we have to stop them.

204
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,479
The knights of the Vale
will stay in the Vale

205
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,189
where they belong,

206
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:29,483
to protect their lord.

207
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:45,082
Will you shut up?

208
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,129
There's hill tribes all around here.

209
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:55,092
If I'm going to die, it may as well
be with a song in my heart.

210
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,554
I should just take your food
and leave you here.

211
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,264
Eh?

212
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:04,352
- What would you do then?
- Starve, most likely.

213
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:07,063
You don't think I'd do it, do you?

214
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:11,651
What do you want, Bronn?
Gold? Women?

215
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:13,778
Golden women?

216
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:16,072
Stick with me and you'll have them all,

217
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:19,241
for as long as I'm around
and not a moment longer.

218
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,203
But you knew that.

219
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:26,290
That is why you so valiantly
took up arms to defend my honor.

220
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,543
Fair enough.

221
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,546
But don't go looking
for me to bend the knee

222
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:35,883
and "my lord" you
every time you take a shit.

223
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:39,470
I'm not your toady
and I'm not your friend.

224
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,806
Though I would treasure your friendship,

225
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:45,101
I'm mainly interested in your
facility with murder.

226
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:47,895
And if the day ever comes when
you're tempted to sell me out,

227
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,563
remember this -

228
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,315
whatever their price,

229
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,025
I'll beat it.

230
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,194
I like living.

231
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:03,035
Tyrion.

232
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:06,455
Tyrion.

233
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:12,378
Tyrion.

234
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,193
Come, share our fire.

235
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,530
Help yourselves to our goat.

236
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,122
When you meet your gods, you tell them

237
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:53,794
Shagga, son of Dolf,
of the Stone Crows sent you.

238
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,131
I am Tyrion, son of Tywin
of Clan Lannister.

239
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,259
How would you like to die,
Tyrion, son of Tywin?

240
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,181
In my own bed, at the age of 80

241
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:07,808
with a belly full of wine and
a girl's mouth around my cock.

242
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,524
Take the halfman.

243
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:18,611
He can dance for the children.
Kill the other one.

244
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:20,863
No, no, no, no, no!

245
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,949
My... My house is rich and powerful.

246
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:28,162
If you see us through these mountains,
my father will shower you with gold.

247
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,664
We have no use for a halfman's promises.

248
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:35,169
Halfman maybe, but at least I have
the courage to face my enemies.

249
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:39,131
What do the Stone Crows do?
Hide behind rocks and shiver

250
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:41,675
when the knights of the Vale ride by?

251
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,762
Are those the best weapons
you could steal?

252
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:49,767
Good enough for killing sheep,
if the sheep don't fight back.

253
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:51,977
Lannister smiths shit better steel.

254
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:01,028
You think you can win us
over with your trinkets?

255
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:16,335
That trinket is worth more than
everything your tribe owns.

256
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:20,881
But if you help us, Shagga, son of Dolf,

257
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,217
I will not give you trinkets.

258
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,845
I will give you this.

259
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:28,305
What is "this"?

260
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,976
The Vale of Arryn.

261
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:35,354
The lords of the Vale have always
spat upon the hill tribes.

262
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:39,608
The lords of the Vale want me dead.

263
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,405
I believe it is time
for new lords of the Vale.

264
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:54,206
Now there's a rare sight...

265
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:58,335
Not only a bastard,
but a traitor's bastard.

266
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:11,390
- Jon, no!
- Jon, stop, put it down!

267
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:16,896
Blood will always tell.

268
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,982
You'll hang for this, bastard.

269
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,671
I told you not to do anything stupid.

270
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:46,091
You're confined to quarters. Go.

271
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,785
Ghost, what's wrong?

272
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,789
Is someone out there?

273
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:50,197
Commander?

274
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:56,036
Stay.

275
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:09,842
Hello?

276
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:20,936
Who's there?

277
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,528
Lord Commander?

278
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,806
Snow?

279
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,933
Commander!

280
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,908
Move!

281
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:36,804
What did they do?

282
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:40,182
<font color="#ffff00">Lamb men make good slaves.</font>

283
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:42,935
<font color="#ffff00">Khal Drogo will make a gift
of them to the slavers,</font>

284
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,062
<font color="#ffff00">and the slavers will give us gold...</font>

285
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:52,611
<font color="#ffff00">...and silk, and steel.</font>

286
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:56,657
I thought the Dothraki
didn't believe in money.

287
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:59,868
Gold to hire ships, Princess,

288
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:02,704
ships to sail to Westeros.

289
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:21,223
Jorah, make them stop.

290
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,308
- Khaleesi?
- You heard me.

291
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:27,020
These men have shed blood for their khal.
Now they claim their rewards.

292
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:29,356
<font color="#ffff00">She is a lamb girl, Khaleesi.</font>

293
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,567
<font color="#ffff00">The riders do her honor.</font>

294
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:33,944
<font color="#ffff00">If her wailing offends the Khaleesi,</font>

295
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,113
<font color="#ffff00">I will bring you her tongue.</font>

296
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:42,035
Princess, you have a gentle heart,
but this is how it's always been.

297
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:45,038
I do not have a gentle heart, ser.

298
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:49,001
<font color="#ffff00">Do as I command or Khal Drogo
will know the reason why.</font>

299
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:04,266
Come.

300
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:12,232
- What do you want done with them?
- Bring her to me.

301
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,693
And those women there.

302
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:18,113
You cannot claim them all, Princess.

303
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,407
I can,

304
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,367
and I will.

305
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:41,261
<font color="#ffff00">Moon of my life,</font>

306
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:45,390
<font color="#ffff00">Mago says you haven taken his spoils,</font>

307
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:48,936
<font color="#ffff00">a daughter of a lamb man
who was his to mount.</font>

308
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:51,855
<font color="#ffff00">Tell me the truth of this.</font>

309
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:57,694
<font color="#ffff00">Mago speaks the truth,
my sun and stars.</font>

310
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,781
<font color="#ffff00">I have claimed many daughters this day...</font>

311
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:02,449
<font color="#ffff00">...so they cannot be mounted.</font>

312
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:07,996
<font color="#ffff00">This is the way of war.</font>

313
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:10,040
<font color="#ffff00">These women are slaves now...</font>

314
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:13,418
<font color="#ffff00">...to do with as we please.</font>

315
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,797
<font color="#ffff00">It pleases me to keep them safe.</font>

316
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:20,926
<font color="#ffff00">If your riders would mount them,
let them take them for wives.</font>

317
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:25,138
<font color="#ffff00">Does the horse mate with the lamb?</font>

318
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:29,142
<font color="#ffff00">The dragon feeds on horse and lamb alike.</font>

319
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,645
<font color="#ffff00">You are a foreigner.</font>

320
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,814
<font color="#ffff00">You do not command me.</font>

321
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:37,818
<font color="#ffff00">I am Khaleesi. I do command you.</font>

322
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,155
<font color="#ffff00">See how fierce she grows?</font>

323
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:46,618
<font color="#ffff00">That is my son inside her,
the stallion that will mount the world,</font>

324
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:50,122
<font color="#ffff00">filling her with his fire.</font>

325
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,250
<font color="#ffff00">I will hear no more.</font>

326
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:55,877
<font color="#ffff00">Mago, find somewhere else
to stick your cock.</font>

327
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:02,551
<font color="#ffff00">A Khal who takes orders from
a foreign whore is no Khal.</font>

328
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:18,525
<font color="#ffff00">I will not have your body burned.</font>

329
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:22,446
<font color="#ffff00">I will not give you that honor.</font>

330
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,077
<font color="#ffff00">The beetles will feed on your eyes.</font>

331
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:32,331
<font color="#ffff00">The worms will crawl through your lungs.</font>

332
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:42,382
<font color="#ffff00">The rain will fall on your rotting skin...</font>

333
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:48,013
<font color="#ffff00">...until nothing is left of you but bones.</font>

334
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,517
<font color="#ffff00">First you have to kill me.</font>

335
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:54,686
<font color="#ffff00">I already have.</font>

336
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:16,249
<font color="#ffff00">My sun and stars is wounded.</font>

337
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,335
<font color="#ffff00">A scratch...</font>

338
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,045
<font color="#ffff00">...moon of my life.</font>

339
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,880
<font color="#ffff00">Where are the healers?</font>

340
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:24,966
<font color="#ffff00">This is the bite of a fly.</font>

341
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:28,553
<font color="#ffff00">I can help the great rider with his cut.</font>

342
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:33,600
<font color="#ffff00">The Khal needs no help from
slaves who lie with sheep.</font>

343
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,144
<font color="#ffff00">She is mine. Let her speak.</font>

344
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:38,271
Thank you, silver lady.

345
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:43,068
Who are you?

346
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:46,279
I am named Mirri Maz Duur.
I was the godswife of this temple.

347
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:47,656
<font color="#ffff00">Witch.</font>

348
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:50,033
My mother was godswife here before me.

349
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,953
She taught me how to make
healing smokes and ointments.

350
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:55,956
All men are of one flock,
so my people believe.

351
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:58,041
The great shepherd sent me
to earth to heal his...

352
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:03,422
<font color="#ffff00">Too many words.
A witch's words poison the ears.</font>

353
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,966
Lamb or lion,

354
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:10,095
his wound must be washed
and sewn or it will fester.

355
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:14,224
<font color="#ffff00">Let her clean your wound,
my sun and stars...</font>

356
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,768
<font color="#ffff00">...it makes me hurt to see you bleed.</font>

357
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:44,504
For 30 years I've been making
corpses out of men, boy.

358
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:47,174
I'm the man you want
leading the vanguard.

359
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,844
Galbart Glover will lead the van.

360
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:53,513
The bloody wall will melt

361
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:56,892
before an Umber marches behind a Glover.

362
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:01,813
I will lead the van or I will take my men

363
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:04,107
and march them home.

364
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:11,740
You are welcome to do so, Lord Umber.

365
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:14,826
And when I am done with the Lannisters,

366
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:18,705
I will march back north,
root you out of your keep

367
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,458
and hang you for an oathbreaker.

368
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,960
Oathbreaker, is it?!

369
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:30,550
I'll not sit here and swallow insults
from a boy so green he pisses grass.

370
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:46,733
My lord father taught me
it was death to bare steel

371
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,860
against your liege lord.

372
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:52,989
But doubtless the Greatjon only
meant to cut my meat for me.

373
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:57,494
Your meat...

374
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,335
is bloody tough.

375
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:39,536
- What is it? What's happened?
- Shh, it's all right.

376
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:47,043
- Where are you going?
- South. For Father.

377
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:51,047
- But it's the middle of the night.
- The Lannisters have spies everywhere.

378
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:53,633
I don't want them to know we're coming.

379
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:58,513
- They have more men than we do.
- Aye, they do.

380
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:01,683
Can't I come with you?
I can ride now.

381
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:04,936
You've seen me riding.
And I won't get in the way, I...

382
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:07,606
There must always be
a Stark at Winterfell.

383
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:10,942
Until I return that will be you.

384
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:16,740
You are not to leave the castle walls
while we are gone. Do you understand?

385
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:21,786
Listen to Maester Luwin.
Look after your little brother.

386
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:25,999
- I will.
- I'll send letters whenever I can,

387
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:30,128
but if you don't hear from me,
don't be scared.

388
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:37,469
Until I return.

389
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:01,159
How long have you been hiding out there?

390
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:04,329
Robb will be looking
for you to say goodbye.

391
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:09,334
- They've all gone away.
- They'll be back soon.

392
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:12,754
Robb will free Father and they'll
come back with Mother.

393
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:16,925
No, they won't.

394
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:23,890
Please watch over Robb.

395
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:27,102
And watch over all the other
men from Winterfell.

396
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:29,396
And Theon too, I suppose.

397
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,445
You hear them, boy?

398
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:41,032
The old gods are answering you.

399
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:45,537
- What are you doing here?
- They're my gods too.

400
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:51,000
Beyond the Wall, they're the only gods.

401
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:55,547
- Even slaves are allowed to pray.
- You're not a slave.

402
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:01,803
Well, your friend did put
a knife to my throat.

403
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:05,306
I'm not complaining, little lord,

404
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,476
just telling truths.

405
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:12,981
What did you mean about hearing the gods?

406
00:37:13,106 --> 00:37:16,401
You asked them, they're answering you.

407
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:19,863
Shh.

408
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:23,366
Open your ears.

409
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:28,788
It's only the wind.

410
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:32,584
Who do you think sends
the wind if not the gods?

411
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:35,545
They see you, boy.

412
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:39,090
They hear you.

413
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:42,469
Your brother will get no help
from them where he's going.

414
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:45,138
The old gods have no power in the South.

415
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:48,975
The weirwoods there were
all cut down a long time ago.

416
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,686
How can they watch when
they have no eyes?

417
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:58,610
Well, there's a big man.

418
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:01,863
He has giants' blood
in him or I'm the queen.

419
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:05,033
Go back and find your clothes, Hodor.

420
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:07,577
- Go dress.
- Hodor.

421
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:12,874
Are there really giants beyond the wall?

422
00:38:14,584 --> 00:38:17,378
Giants and worse than giants.

423
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:22,175
I tried telling your brother,
he's marching the wrong way.

424
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,678
All these swords,
they should be going north, boy.

425
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:27,806
North, not south!

426
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:34,479
The cold winds are rising.

427
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:52,872
They were touched by white walkers.

428
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:55,208
That's why they came back.

429
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,669
That's why their eyes turned blue.

430
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,839
Only fire will stop them.

431
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:06,386
- How do you know that?
- I read about it in a book...

432
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:09,472
a very old book in Maester Aemon's library.

433
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:16,062
- What else did the book say?
- The white walkers

434
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:19,482
sleep beneath the ice
for thousands of years.

435
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,442
And when they wake up...

436
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:26,239
And when they wake up, what?

437
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:31,703
I hope the Wall's high enough.

438
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:06,905
Summer snows, my lady.

439
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,616
Robb's brought the North with him.

440
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,584
The river lords are falling back
with Jaime Lannister at their heels.

441
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:23,171
And Lord Tywin is bringing around
a second Lannister army from the South.

442
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,840
Our scouts confirm it's even
larger than the Kingslayer's.

443
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:29,135
One army or two, the kings in the North

444
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,931
threw back hosts 10 times as large.

445
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:38,102
Mother!

446
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:45,151
You look well.

447
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:49,280
Lady Catelyn, you're a welcome
sight in these troubled times.

448
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:52,325
We had thought not to meet
you here, my lady.

449
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,702
I had not thought to be here.

450
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:57,205
I would speak with my son alone.

451
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:59,540
I know you will forgive me, my lords.

452
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:01,834
You heard her!
Move your arses!

453
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,253
Come on, out.

454
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:07,298
You too, Greyjoy.
Are you bloody deaf?

455
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:09,008
Have no fear, my lady.

456
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:11,678
We'll shove our swords up
Tywin Lannister's bunghole

457
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:14,514
and then it's on to the
Red Keep to free Ned.

458
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:17,350
- You old devil, Rodrik.
- Jon.

459
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,686
You're not wasting away, are you?

460
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,200
I remember the day you
came into this world,

461
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,828
red-faced and squalling.

462
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:41,082
And now I find you leading a host to war.

463
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:44,961
- There was no one else.
- No one?

464
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:47,130
Who were those men I saw here?

465
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:51,300
- None of them are Starks.
- All of them are seasoned in battle.

466
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:53,553
If you think you can send
me back to Winterfell...

467
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:56,014
Oh, would that I could.

468
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:01,310
There was...

469
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:03,438
a letter.

470
00:42:05,732 --> 00:42:08,067
From Sansa.

471
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:10,361
From the queen, you mean.

472
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:21,539
- There's no mention of Arya.
- No.

473
00:42:32,175 --> 00:42:34,927
How many men do you have?

474
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:36,971
18,000.

475
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:39,432
If I go to King's Landing
and bend my knee to Joffrey...

476
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:42,435
You would never be allowed to leave. No.

477
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:46,272
Our best hope, our only hope,

478
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:50,693
- is that you can defeat them in the field.
- And if I lose?

479
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:53,321
Do you know what happened
to the Targaryen children

480
00:42:53,446 --> 00:42:56,657
- when the Mad King fell?
- They were butchered in their sleep.

481
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:59,077
On the orders of Tywin Lannister.

482
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:01,704
And the years have not made him kinder.

483
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:07,251
If you lose,

484
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:11,339
your father dies, your sisters die,

485
00:43:11,464 --> 00:43:13,508
we die.

486
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,971
Well, that makes it simple, then.

487
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:21,474
I suppose it does.

488
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:48,167
From here it might be best
if Bronn and I continue alone.

489
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,628
Best for Tyrion, son of Tywin.

490
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:52,505
Not best for me.

491
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:55,675
If the halfman betrays us,

492
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,554
Shagga, son of Dolf,
will cut off his manhood...

493
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:02,431
And feed it to the goats, yes.

494
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:06,811
All right, then.

495
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:08,938
Time to meet my father.

496
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:44,015
- Tyrion.
- Uncle.

497
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:45,975
Father.

498
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:50,605
The rumors of your demise
were unfounded.

499
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:54,025
Sorry to disappoint you.

500
00:44:54,859 --> 00:44:56,444
And who are these...

501
00:44:56,569 --> 00:44:58,696
companions of yours?

502
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:03,743
This is Shagga, son of Dolf,

503
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:05,870
chieftain of the Stone Crows.

504
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:10,333
Timett, son of Timett,
ruler of the Burned Men.

505
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:15,254
This fair maid is Chella,
daughter of Cheyk,

506
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:17,298
leader of the Black Ears.

507
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:19,842
And here we have Bronn, son of...

508
00:45:22,011 --> 00:45:24,055
You wouldn't know him.

509
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:28,017
May I present my lord father,

510
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:30,770
Tywin, son of Tytos of House Lannister,

511
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:34,106
Lord of Casterly Rock and
Warden of the West?

512
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:38,236
Kind of you to go to war for me.

513
00:45:41,197 --> 00:45:43,115
You left us no choice.

514
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:45,576
The honor of the house was at stake.

515
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:50,039
Your brother would never have
submitted to capture so meekly.

516
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:52,583
We have our differences, Jaime and I.

517
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:54,794
He's braver. I'm better-looking.

518
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:57,421
He's been covering himself in glory.

519
00:45:57,546 --> 00:46:00,258
Jaime smashed the river lords
at the Golden Tooth,

520
00:46:00,383 --> 00:46:04,262
and now lays siege to Riverrun,
Catelyn Stark's homeland.

521
00:46:04,387 --> 00:46:07,306
- And the Starks? Lord Eddard?
- Is our hostage.

522
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:10,393
He will lead no armies
from his dungeon cell.

523
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:14,397
How did my sweet sister persuade the king
to imprison his dear friend Ned?

524
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:19,277
Robert Baratheon is dead.
Joffrey rules in King's Landing.

525
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:24,031
My sister rules, you mean.

526
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:26,242
Stark's son has called his banners.

527
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:30,705
- He moves south with a strong host.
- A green boy.

528
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:34,625
One taste of battle and he'll run back
to Winterfell with his tail between his legs.

529
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:40,381
Maybe. Though the boy does
have a certain belligerence.

530
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:42,174
You'd like him.

531
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:47,221
While we're on the subject of war,

532
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:49,348
I made promises to my friends here,

533
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,851
and a Lannister always pays his debts.

534
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:54,854
We shall require 3,000 helms and shields,

535
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:57,064
plus swords, pikes,

536
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:59,025
gorgets, maces...

537
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:02,361
if it please my lord,
Ser Addam bids me report

538
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:04,989
that the northmen have crossed the Neck.

539
00:47:07,116 --> 00:47:10,745
The wolf rushes into the lion's jaws.
So be it.

540
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:14,040
Kevan, command the drummers
beat assembly.

541
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:18,461
And send word to Jaime that I am
moving against Robb Stark.

542
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:20,463
At once, my lord.

543
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:36,312
It is said that the men of the mountain
clans are great warriors.

544
00:47:36,437 --> 00:47:38,189
Ride with me against my enemies

545
00:47:38,314 --> 00:47:41,108
and you shall have all my son
promised you and more.

546
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:43,527
Only if the halfman fights with us.

547
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:46,322
Until we hold the steel he pledged us,

548
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:49,867
the little lion's life is ours.

549
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:58,167
The scouts report Lord Tywin moves north.

550
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:01,212
We need to get him on broken ground,
put his knights at a disadvantage.

551
00:48:01,337 --> 00:48:06,300
No, we need to get around him and break
Jaime Lannister's siege of Riverrun.

552
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:09,220
Do that and the river lords will join us.

553
00:48:09,345 --> 00:48:12,932
To do either we need to cross the river
and the only crossing is at the Twins.

554
00:48:13,057 --> 00:48:16,435
Lord Frey controls that bridge.
Your father's bannerman.

555
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,772
"The late Lord Frey" my father calls him.

556
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:23,651
At the Trident, he didn't appear
until the battle was done.

557
00:48:23,776 --> 00:48:27,696
Some men take their oaths
more seriously than others.

558
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:37,456
Robb's right.
We need that bridge.

559
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:39,625
So what's it going to be?

560
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:43,504
Do we move against Jaime or Lord Tywin?

561
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:51,387
Your pardon, my lords.
We've captured a Lannister scout.

562
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:56,600
Don't worry, lad. He won't be
leaving this tent with his head.

563
00:48:58,102 --> 00:49:01,856
- Where did you find him?
- In the brush above the encampment.

564
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:04,150
He looked to be counting.

565
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:15,911
How high did you get?

566
00:49:18,414 --> 00:49:21,167
20,000. Maybe more.

567
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:24,712
You don't have to do this yourself.
Your father would understand...

568
00:49:24,837 --> 00:49:28,799
My father understands mercy,
when there is room for it.

569
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:33,471
And he understands honor...

570
00:49:34,847 --> 00:49:37,099
and courage.

571
00:49:39,185 --> 00:49:41,353
Let him go.

572
00:49:41,896 --> 00:49:44,148
Robb.

573
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:59,663
Tell Lord Tywin winter is coming for him.

574
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:04,168
20,000 northerners marching south
to find out if he really does shit gold.

575
00:50:06,295 --> 00:50:08,547
Yes, my lord.

576
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,674
Thank you, my lord.

577
00:50:19,225 --> 00:50:22,895
Are you touched, boy?!
Letting him go?

578
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,688
You call me boy again.

579
00:50:26,357 --> 00:50:27,858
Go on.

580
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:47,461
Oi.

581
00:50:53,384 --> 00:50:56,262
It is also the wish of His Grace

582
00:50:56,387 --> 00:51:00,307
that his loyal servant Janos Slynt,

583
00:51:01,517 --> 00:51:04,186
- Commander of the City Watch...
- Ser Aron.

584
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:08,941
...be at once raised to the rank of lord...

585
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:10,359
Lord Gyles.

586
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:13,779
...and granted the ancient
seat of Harrenhal,

587
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:17,449
and that his sons and grandsons
shall hold this honor

588
00:51:17,575 --> 00:51:22,454
after him until the end of time.

589
00:51:25,958 --> 00:51:30,004
In the place of the traitor Eddard Stark,

590
00:51:30,129 --> 00:51:34,425
it is the wish of His Grace
that Tywin Lannister,

591
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:38,971
Lord of Casterly Rock
and Warden of the West,

592
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:42,308
be appointed Hand of the King.

593
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:44,351
Lastly,

594
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:47,229
in these times of treason and turmoil,

595
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:50,399
it is the view of council

596
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:53,569
that the life and safety

597
00:51:53,694 --> 00:51:55,613
of King Joffrey

598
00:51:55,738 --> 00:51:59,867
be of paramount importance.

599
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:04,038
Ser Barristan Selmy.

600
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:13,922
Your Grace, I am yours to command.

601
00:52:14,048 --> 00:52:16,008
Rise, Ser Barristan.

602
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:18,969
You may remove your helm.

603
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:26,644
You have served the realm
long and faithfully.

604
00:52:26,769 --> 00:52:30,522
Every man and woman in the Seven
Kingdoms owes you thanks.

605
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:33,942
But it is time to put aside your
armor and your sword.

606
00:52:34,068 --> 00:52:36,820
It is time to rest and
look back with pride

607
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:39,823
on your many years of service.

608
00:52:40,741 --> 00:52:43,202
Your Grace, the Kingsguard
is a sworn brotherhood.

609
00:52:43,327 --> 00:52:47,873
Our vows are taken for life.
Only death relieves us of our sacred trust.

610
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:51,794
Whose death, Ser Barristan?
Yours or your king's?

611
00:52:52,628 --> 00:52:54,546
You let my father die.

612
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:57,466
You're too old to protect anybody.

613
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:02,471
- Your Grace...
- The council has determined

614
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:05,057
that Ser Jaime Lannister
will take your place

615
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:08,894
- as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
- The man who profaned his blade

616
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:11,063
with the blood of the king
he had sworn to defend!

617
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:13,065
Careful, ser.

618
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:17,277
We have nothing but gratitude
for your long service, good ser.

619
00:53:17,403 --> 00:53:19,905
You shall be given a stout
keep beside the sea,

620
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:22,741
with servants to look
after your every need.

621
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:26,829
A hall to die in and men to bury me.

622
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:31,417
I am a knight.

623
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:34,545
I shall die a knight.

624
00:53:40,551 --> 00:53:42,594
A naked knight, apparently.

625
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:57,693
Even now I could cut through
the five of you like carving a cake!

626
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:03,949
Here, boy!

627
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,660
Melt it down and add it to the others.

628
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:25,262
if any man in this hall has other matters

629
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:29,057
to set before His Grace,
let him speak now

630
00:54:29,183 --> 00:54:31,643
or go forth and hold his silence.

631
00:54:34,897 --> 00:54:36,607
Your Grace.

632
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:39,818
Come forward, my lady.

633
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:43,655
The Lady Sansa of House Stark.

634
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:48,368
Do you have some business
for the king and the council, Sansa?

635
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:50,412
I do.

636
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:58,712
As it please Your Grace,
I ask mercy for my father,

637
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:01,423
Lord Eddard Stark,
who was Hand of the King.

638
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:04,676
Treason is a noxious weed.

639
00:55:05,344 --> 00:55:08,847
- It should be torn out, root...
- Let her speak.

640
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:11,642
I want to hear what she says.

641
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,685
Thank you, Your Grace.

642
00:55:13,811 --> 00:55:16,355
Do you deny your father's crime?

643
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:20,234
No, my lords.
I know he must be punished.

644
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:22,986
All I ask is mercy.

645
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:25,739
I know my lord father
must regret what he did.

646
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:27,866
He was King Robert's friend
and he loved him.

647
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,660
You all know he loved him.

648
00:55:30,494 --> 00:55:34,498
He never wanted to be Hand
until the king asked him.

649
00:55:34,623 --> 00:55:38,377
They must have lied to him - Lord Renly
or Lord Stannis or somebody.

650
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:40,337
They must have lied!

651
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:42,840
He said I wasn't the king.

652
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:47,177
- Why did he say that?
- He was badly hurt.

653
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:50,264
Maester Pycelle was giving
him milk of the poppy.

654
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:54,184
He wasn't himself.
Otherwise he never would have said it.

655
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:58,230
A child's faith.

656
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:00,649
Such sweet innocence.

657
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:05,529
And yet they say wisdom oft comes
from the mouths of babes.

658
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:10,158
Treason is treason!

659
00:56:13,412 --> 00:56:15,497
Anything else?

660
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:20,794
If you still have any affection
in your heart for me,

661
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:24,047
please do me this kindness, Your Grace.

662
00:56:33,724 --> 00:56:35,809
Your sweet words have moved me.

663
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:40,856
But your father has to confess.

664
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:44,443
He has to confess and say
that I'm the king...

665
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:49,448
or there'll be no mercy for him.

666
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:56,079
He will.
