2
00:02:11,716 --> 00:02:13,259
You need to drink, child.

3
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:19,641
And eat.

4
00:02:23,394 --> 00:02:25,688
Isn't there anything else?

5
00:02:26,648 --> 00:02:30,860
The Dothraki have two things
in abundance - grass and horses.

6
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:33,196
People can't live on grass.

7
00:02:42,455 --> 00:02:44,832
In the Shadow Lands
beyond Asshai,

8
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:47,293
they say there are fields of ghost grass

9
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:50,630
with stalks as pale as milk
that glow in the night.

10
00:02:50,755 --> 00:02:53,174
It murders all other grass.

11
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:55,718
The Dothraki believe that one day

12
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:58,930
it will cover everything -
that's the way the world will end.

13
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,779
It'll get easier.

14
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,526
Khaleesi!

15
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:55,486
Your hands.

16
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:09,041
We're still not far from Pentos,
Your Grace.

17
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:11,544
Master lllyrio has
extended his hospitality.

18
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:13,337
You'd be more comfortable there.

19
00:04:13,463 --> 00:04:16,215
I have no interest
in hospitality or comfort.

20
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:20,595
I'll stay with Drogo until he fulfills his end
of the bargain and I have my crown.

21
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,972
As you wish, Your Grace.

22
00:04:24,015 --> 00:04:26,350
Well, Mormont,
as brutish as this life is,

23
00:04:26,476 --> 00:04:28,644
I suppose it is preferable to beheading.

24
00:04:30,313 --> 00:04:32,315
What did Ned Stark want you for?

25
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:35,610
Buying from a slaver?

26
00:04:35,735 --> 00:04:37,653
Selling to one.

27
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:39,697
Some poachers I caught on my land.

28
00:04:41,491 --> 00:04:45,203
Under my reign, you won't be punished
for such nonsense.

29
00:04:45,328 --> 00:04:47,163
You can rest assured of that.

30
00:05:02,804 --> 00:05:05,056
<i>_</i>

31
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:14,440
Better-looking bitches
than you're used to, Uncle.

32
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:21,280
My mother's been looking for you.

33
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:23,574
We ride for King's Landing today.

34
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:26,661
Before you go, you will call
on Lord and Lady Stark

35
00:05:26,786 --> 00:05:29,121
and offer your sympathies.

36
00:05:29,247 --> 00:05:31,624
What good will my sympathies do them?

37
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:36,337
None. But it is expected of you.

38
00:05:36,462 --> 00:05:38,381
Your absence has already been noted.

39
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:40,466
The boy means nothing to me.

40
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:42,927
And I can't stand
the wailing of women.

41
00:05:45,263 --> 00:05:47,056
One word and I'll hit you again.

42
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:48,766
I'm telling Mother!

43
00:05:54,564 --> 00:05:56,482
and you will fall on your knees
in front of them

44
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,402
and tell them how very sorry you are
that you are at their service,

45
00:05:59,527 --> 00:06:02,738
and that all your prayers are with them.
Do you understand?

46
00:06:02,864 --> 00:06:05,032
You can't...

47
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:06,617
Do you understand'?

48
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,668
The Prince will
remember that, little lord.

49
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:17,712
I hope so.

50
00:06:17,837 --> 00:06:21,132
If he forgets, be a good dog
and remind him.

51
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:27,054
Ah. Time for breakfast.

52
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:37,273
Bread. And two of those little fish.

53
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:40,651
And a mug of dark beer
to wash it down.

54
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:45,364
And bacon, burnt black.

55
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:47,366
- Hyah.

56
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:50,328
- Little brother.
- Beloved siblings.

57
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,667
Is Bran going to die?

58
00:06:58,586 --> 00:06:59,670
Apparently not.

59
00:07:03,007 --> 00:07:06,427
- What do you mean?
- The maester says the boy may live.

60
00:07:14,644 --> 00:07:17,563
It's no mercy, letting a child
linger in such pain.

61
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:19,440
Only the gods know for certain.

62
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:21,943
All the rest of us can do is pray.

63
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:25,988
The charms of the North
seem entirely lost on you.

64
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,782
I still can't believe you're going.

65
00:07:27,907 --> 00:07:29,951
It's ridiculous, even for you.

66
00:07:30,076 --> 00:07:31,786
Where's your sense of wonder?

67
00:07:31,911 --> 00:07:35,998
The greatest structure ever built,
the intrepid men of the Night's Watch,

68
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:38,376
the wintry abode of the white walkers.

69
00:07:38,501 --> 00:07:41,587
Tell me you're not thinking
of taking the black.

70
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:44,590
And go celibate?
The whores would go begging

71
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:46,592
from Dorne to Casterly Rock.

72
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:48,803
No, I just want to stand
on top of the Wall

73
00:07:48,928 --> 00:07:50,721
and piss off the edge of the world.

74
00:07:52,223 --> 00:07:54,809
The children don't need to hear your filth.

75
00:07:56,769 --> 00:07:58,479
Come.

76
00:08:04,735 --> 00:08:08,280
Even if the boy lives,
he'll be a cripple, a grotesque.

77
00:08:08,406 --> 00:08:10,866
Give me a good, clean death any day.

78
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:15,746
Speaking for the grotesques,
I'd have to disagree.

79
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:18,624
Death is so final, whereas life...

80
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:20,918
ah, life is full of possibilities.

81
00:08:22,253 --> 00:08:26,549
I hope the boy does wake. I'd be very
interested to hear what he has to say.

82
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:30,928
My dear brother,

83
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:33,723
there are times you make me wonder
whose side you're on.

84
00:08:33,848 --> 00:08:35,975
My dear brother, you wound me.

85
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,561
You know how much
I love my family.

86
00:08:57,997 --> 00:08:59,123
Please.

87
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:02,543
Oh, I would have dressed, Your Grace.

88
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:04,962
This is your home. I'm your guest.

89
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:10,342
Handsome one, isn't he?

90
00:09:11,052 --> 00:09:15,598
I lost my first boy,
a little black-haired beauty.

91
00:09:15,723 --> 00:09:17,600
He was a fighter too -

92
00:09:17,725 --> 00:09:19,810
tried to beat the fever that took him.

93
00:09:21,896 --> 00:09:23,898
Forgive me.

94
00:09:24,023 --> 00:09:25,900
It's the last thing you
need to hear right now.

95
00:09:26,025 --> 00:09:28,027
I never knew.

96
00:09:28,152 --> 00:09:30,029
It was years ago.

97
00:09:31,447 --> 00:09:35,034
Robert was crazed,
beat his hands bloody on the wall,

98
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:38,496
all the things men do
to show you how much they care.

99
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:45,503
The boy looked just like him.

100
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:49,006
Such a little thing.

101
00:09:50,216 --> 00:09:52,218
A bird without feathers.

102
00:09:55,096 --> 00:09:57,389
They came to take his body away

103
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:02,144
and Robert held me.
I screamed and I battled, but he held me.

104
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:09,193
That little bundle.

105
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:13,405
They took him away
and I never saw him again.

106
00:10:13,531 --> 00:10:15,866
Never have visited the crypt, never.

107
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:28,504
I pray to the Mother
every morning and night

108
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:30,756
that she return your child to you.

109
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,593
I am grateful.

110
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,513
Perhaps this time she'll listen.

111
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:31,650
A sword for the Wall?

112
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,863
- I already have one.
- Good man.

113
00:11:35,988 --> 00:11:38,657
- Have you swung it yet'?
- Of course I have.

114
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:40,284
At someone, I mean.

115
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:48,417
It's a strange thing,
the first time you cut a man.

116
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:51,712
You realize we're nothing
but sacks of meat and blood,

117
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:54,632
and some bone to keep it all standing.

118
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:59,011
Let me thank you ahead of time

119
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:01,889
for guarding us all from the perils
beyond the Wall -

120
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:04,516
wildlings and white walkers
and whatnot.

121
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:10,773
We're grateful to have good, strong men
like you protecting us.

122
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,986
We've guarded the Kingdoms
for 8,000 years.

123
00:12:19,073 --> 00:12:21,242
Is it "we" already'?

124
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:24,203
Have you taken your vows, then?

125
00:12:24,328 --> 00:12:25,704
Soon enough.

126
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:30,376
Give my regards to the Night's Watch.

127
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:34,546
I'm sure it will be thrilling to serve
in such an elite force. And if not...

128
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:38,008
it's only for life.

129
00:12:57,403 --> 00:12:59,405
Thank you, Nymeria.

130
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:09,164
Septa Mordane says
I have to do it again.

131
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:12,001
My things weren't
properly folded, she says.

132
00:13:12,126 --> 00:13:15,087
Who cares how they're folded?
They're going to get all messed up anyway.

133
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:17,381
It's good you've got help.

134
00:13:17,506 --> 00:13:19,091
Watch.

135
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:21,135
Nymeria, gloves.

136
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:29,518
- Impressive.
- Shut up.

137
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:31,603
Nymeria, gloves!

138
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:35,774
I have something for you.

139
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:38,235
And it has to be packed very carefully.

140
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:39,945
A present?

141
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,031
Close the door.

142
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,920
This is no toy.

143
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:02,426
Be careful you don't cut yourself.

144
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,389
- It's so skinny.
- So are you.

145
00:14:08,724 --> 00:14:10,559
I had the blacksmith
make it for you special.

146
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:11,894
It won't hack a man's head off,

147
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:13,896
but it can poke him full of holes
if you're quick enough.

148
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:16,690
- I can be quick.
- You'll have to work at it every day.

149
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:19,610
How does it feel?

150
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,821
Do you like the balance?

151
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:24,448
I think so.

152
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:28,327
First lesson - stick them with the pointy end.

153
00:14:28,452 --> 00:14:30,329
I know which end to use.

154
00:14:36,335 --> 00:14:37,878
I'm going to miss you.

155
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:40,839
Careful.

156
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:55,020
All the best swords have names, you know.

157
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:00,317
Sansa can keep her sewing needles.

158
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:03,987
I've got a needle of my own.

159
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,838
I came to say goodbye to Bran.

160
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:22,589
You've said it.

161
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:36,311
I wish I could be here when you wake up.

162
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:42,151
I'm going north with Uncle Benjen.

163
00:15:42,276 --> 00:15:43,610
I'm taking the black.

164
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:55,372
I know we always talked about
seeing the Wall together,

165
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:59,126
but you'll be able to come visit me
at Castle Black when you're better.

166
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:03,755
I'll know my way around by then.

167
00:16:03,881 --> 00:16:06,216
I'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch.

168
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:14,308
We can go out walking beyond the Wall,
if you're not afraid.

169
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:31,867
I want you...

170
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:33,660
to leave.

171
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,930
17 years ago

172
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:37,474
you rode off with Robert Baratheon.

173
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:43,021
You came back a year later
with another woman's son.

174
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:47,234
And now you're leaving again.

175
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:51,697
I have no choice.

176
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:55,701
That's what men always say
when honor calls.

177
00:17:55,826 --> 00:17:59,162
That's what you tell your families,
tell yourselves.

178
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:03,166
You do have a choice.

179
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:05,836
And you've made it.

180
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:11,925
Cat...

181
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:19,474
I can't do it, Ned.

182
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:24,396
I really can't.

183
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:25,981
You can.

184
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:29,693
You must.

185
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:56,011
You've said goodbye to Bran'?

186
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:58,138
He's not going to die. I know it.

187
00:18:58,263 --> 00:19:00,432
You Starks are hard to kill.

188
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:02,976
My mother?

189
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:05,646
- She was very kind.
- Good.

190
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:09,650
Next time I see you,
you'll be all in black.

191
00:19:09,775 --> 00:19:11,860
It was always my color.

192
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,821
Farewell, Snow.

193
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:16,573
And you, Stark.

194
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:11,128
There's great honor serving
in the Night's Watch.

195
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:16,758
The Starks have manned the Wall
for thousands of years.

196
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:19,678
And you are a Stark.

197
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:21,888
You might not have my name,

198
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:24,015
but you have my blood.

199
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:32,649
Is my mother alive?

200
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:36,945
Does she know about me?
Where I am, where I'm going?

201
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:39,656
Does she care?

202
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:43,952
The next time we see each other,

203
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:46,121
we'll talk about your mother.

204
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:47,998
Hmm?

205
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:49,583
I promise.

206
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:32,167
Gods, this is country!

207
00:21:34,211 --> 00:21:37,464
I've half a mind to leave them
all behind and keep going.

208
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:41,927
I've half a mind to go with you.

209
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:46,765
What do you say, just you and me
on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides,

210
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:50,185
a couple of tavern wenches
to warm our beds tonight.

211
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,979
You should have asked me 20 years ago.

212
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:55,857
There were wars to fight,
women to marry -

213
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:58,235
we never had the chance to be young.

214
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,986
I recall a few chances.

215
00:22:03,949 --> 00:22:06,493
There was that one...
Oh, what was her name?

216
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:08,537
That common girl of yours?

217
00:22:08,662 --> 00:22:11,456
Becca. With the great big tits
you could bury your face in.

218
00:22:11,581 --> 00:22:13,792
Bessie.
She was one of yours.

219
00:22:13,917 --> 00:22:17,587
Bessie!
Thank the gods for Bessie.

220
00:22:17,712 --> 00:22:19,297
And her tits.

221
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,759
Yours was, er... Aleena?

222
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:25,762
No. You told me once. Er... Meryl'?

223
00:22:25,887 --> 00:22:27,848
Your bastard's mother?

224
00:22:29,641 --> 00:22:31,810
- Wylla.
- That's it.

225
00:22:31,935 --> 00:22:34,020
She must have been a rare wench

226
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:37,023
to make Lord Eddard Stark
forget his honor.

227
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:39,192
You never told me what she looked like.

228
00:22:40,277 --> 00:22:41,486
Nor will I.

229
00:22:44,114 --> 00:22:45,991
We were at war.

230
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:48,910
None of us knew if we were
gonna go back home again.

231
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:52,038
You're too hard on yourself.
You always have been.

232
00:22:54,124 --> 00:22:57,210
I swear if I weren't your king,
you'd have hit me already.

233
00:22:57,335 --> 00:23:00,672
The worst thing about your coronation -

234
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:02,799
I'll never get to hit you again.

235
00:23:05,135 --> 00:23:07,596
Trust me, that's not the worst thing.

236
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:13,602
There was a rider in the night.

237
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:23,194
Daenerys Targaryen has wed
some Dothraki horselord.

238
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,155
What of it'? Do we send her
a wedding gift?

239
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,574
A knife perhaps, a good, sharp one,

240
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:29,701
and a bold man to wield it.

241
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:31,620
She's little more than a child.

242
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:34,998
Soon enough that child will spread her legs
and start breeding.

243
00:23:35,123 --> 00:23:38,752
- Tell me we're not speaking of this.
- Oh, it's unspeakable to you?

244
00:23:38,877 --> 00:23:42,172
What her father did to your family -
that was unspeakable.

245
00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:44,591
What Rhaegar Targaryen
did to your sister -

246
00:23:44,716 --> 00:23:46,718
the woman I loved.

247
00:23:46,843 --> 00:23:49,888
I'll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on.

248
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:51,973
But you can't get your hands
on this one, can you?

249
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:54,684
This Khal Drogo,

250
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:56,686
it's said he has 100,000 men
in his horde.

251
00:23:56,811 --> 00:23:59,564
Even a million Dothraki
are no threat to the realm,

252
00:23:59,689 --> 00:24:02,275
as long as they remain on the other side
of the Narrow Sea.

253
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,361
They have no ships, Robert.

254
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:07,447
There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms
who call me usurper.

255
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:12,285
If the Targaryen boy crosses
with a Dothraki horde at his back,

256
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:15,080
- the scum will join him.
- He will not cross.

257
00:24:16,665 --> 00:24:19,918
And if by chance he does,
we'll throw him back into the sea.

258
00:24:25,006 --> 00:24:27,008
There's a war coming, Ned.

259
00:24:28,176 --> 00:24:31,262
I don't know when,
I don't know who we'll be fighting,

260
00:24:31,388 --> 00:24:32,847
but it's coming.

261
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:46,671
Sit.

262
00:25:46,796 --> 00:25:48,548
You'll be fed.

263
00:25:52,677 --> 00:25:54,345
Untie them.

264
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:57,682
Ah, rapers.

265
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:03,646
They were given a choice, no doubt-
castration or the Wall.

266
00:26:03,772 --> 00:26:06,024
Most choose the knife.

267
00:26:11,112 --> 00:26:13,573
Not impressed by your new brothers?

268
00:26:16,576 --> 00:26:18,328
Lovely thing about the Watch -

269
00:26:18,453 --> 00:26:21,748
you discard your old family
and get a whole new one.

270
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,634
Why do you read so much'?

271
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:35,887
Look at me and tell me what you see.

272
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,099
Is this a trick?

273
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,936
What you see is a dwarf.

274
00:26:43,061 --> 00:26:46,231
If I'd been born a peasant they might've
left me out in the woods to die.

275
00:26:46,356 --> 00:26:50,485
Alas, I was born a Lannister
of Casterly Rock.

276
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,570
Things are expected of me.

277
00:26:52,695 --> 00:26:55,115
My father was the Hand of the King
for 20 years.

278
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,283
Until your brother killed that king.

279
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:06,793
Yes, until my brother killed him.

280
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:11,381
Life is full of these little ironies.

281
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:15,135
My sister married the new king, and...

282
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,720
my repulsive nephew
will be king after him.

283
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:23,601
I must do my part for the honor of my house.
Wouldn't you agree?

284
00:27:25,436 --> 00:27:27,313
But how?

285
00:27:27,438 --> 00:27:30,191
Well, my brother has his sword

286
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:31,609
and I have my mind,

287
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:35,738
and a mind needs books
like a sword needs a whetstone.

288
00:27:35,864 --> 00:27:38,533
That's why I read so much, Jon Snow.

289
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:44,455
And you?

290
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:46,708
What's your story, bastard?

291
00:27:49,002 --> 00:27:51,880
Ask me nicely
and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf.

292
00:27:55,967 --> 00:27:58,720
A bastard boy with nothing to inherit,

293
00:27:58,845 --> 00:28:03,266
off to join the ancient order
of the Night's Watch,

294
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:07,187
alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms.

295
00:28:07,312 --> 00:28:08,938
The Night's Watch protects
the realm from...

296
00:28:09,063 --> 00:28:12,400
Ah, yes, yes, against
grumpkins and snarks

297
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:16,029
and all the other monsters
your wet nurse warned you about.

298
00:28:16,154 --> 00:28:18,448
You're a smart boy.

299
00:28:18,573 --> 00:28:20,992
You don't believe that nonsense.

300
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:31,461
Everything's better
with some wine in the belly.

301
00:29:06,037 --> 00:29:10,041
It's time we reviewed
the accounts, my lady.

302
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:13,962
You'll want to know how much
this royal visit has cost us.

303
00:29:15,463 --> 00:29:17,465
Talk to Poole about it.

304
00:29:19,509 --> 00:29:22,720
Poole went south
with Lord Stark, my lady.

305
00:29:24,138 --> 00:29:25,348
We need a new steward,

306
00:29:25,473 --> 00:29:28,559
and there are several other
appointments that require

307
00:29:28,685 --> 00:29:32,563
- our immediate attention.
- I don't care about appointments!

308
00:29:33,856 --> 00:29:35,817
I'll make the appointments.

309
00:29:38,695 --> 00:29:40,571
We'll talk about it first thing in the morning.

310
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:42,699
Very good, my lord.

311
00:29:44,993 --> 00:29:46,411
My lady.

312
00:29:59,549 --> 00:30:01,759
When was the last time you left this room?

313
00:30:03,094 --> 00:30:04,345
I have to take care of him.

314
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,180
He's not going to die, Mother.

315
00:30:06,306 --> 00:30:08,099
Maester Luwin says the most
dangerous time has passed.

316
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:09,267
What if he's wrong?

317
00:30:09,392 --> 00:30:12,812
- Bran needs me.
- Rickon needs you.

318
00:30:13,813 --> 00:30:15,648
He's six.

319
00:30:15,773 --> 00:30:18,985
He doesn't know what's happening.
He follows me around all day,

320
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:21,404
- clutching my leg, crying...
- Close the windows!

321
00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:23,531
I can't stand it!
Please make them stop!

322
00:30:27,452 --> 00:30:28,911
Fire.

323
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:32,165
You stay here. I'll come back.

324
00:30:50,266 --> 00:30:52,393
You're not supposed to be here.

325
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:55,146
No one is supposed to be here.

326
00:30:55,646 --> 00:30:57,523
It's a mercy.

327
00:30:57,648 --> 00:30:59,484
He's dead already.

328
00:31:01,444 --> 00:31:02,987
No!

329
00:32:10,138 --> 00:32:13,808
- Have you ever seen a dragon?
- Dragon gone, Khaleesi.

330
00:32:14,517 --> 00:32:16,769
Everywhere? Even in the East?

331
00:32:16,894 --> 00:32:19,897
No dragon. Brave men kill them.

332
00:32:20,523 --> 00:32:22,942
- It is known.
- It is known.

333
00:32:23,067 --> 00:32:26,946
A trader from Qarth told me
that dragons come from the moon.

334
00:32:27,071 --> 00:32:29,198
The moon?

335
00:32:29,323 --> 00:32:31,951
He told me the moon
was an egg, Khaleesi,

336
00:32:32,076 --> 00:32:34,620
that once there were two moons in the sky.

337
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:38,666
But one wandered too close to the sun
and it cracked from the heat,

338
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:41,752
and out of it poured
a thousand thousand dragons

339
00:32:41,878 --> 00:32:43,713
and they drank the sun's fire.

340
00:32:43,838 --> 00:32:46,799
Moon is no egg.

341
00:32:46,924 --> 00:32:49,677
Moon is goddess - wife of sun.

342
00:32:49,802 --> 00:32:52,346
- It is known.
- It is known.

343
00:32:54,182 --> 00:32:55,766
Leave me with her.

344
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:07,653
Why did the trader from Qarth
tell you these stories?

345
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:10,323
Men like to talk when they're happy.

346
00:33:10,448 --> 00:33:14,494
Before your brother bought me for you,
it was my job to make men happy.

347
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:16,829
How old were you?

348
00:33:16,954 --> 00:33:19,499
I was nine when my mother
sold me to the pleasure house.

349
00:33:19,624 --> 00:33:21,209
Nine?!

350
00:33:21,334 --> 00:33:25,254
I did not touch a man
for three years, Khaleesi.

351
00:33:25,379 --> 00:33:28,216
First you must learn.

352
00:33:31,385 --> 00:33:34,555
Can you teach me
how to make the khal happy'?

353
00:33:35,973 --> 00:33:37,725
Yes.

354
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,602
Will it take three years?

355
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:42,688
No.

356
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,836
Welcome.

357
00:35:36,886 --> 00:35:40,306
What I am about to tell you
must remain between us.

358
00:35:41,891 --> 00:35:44,393
I don't think Bran fell from that tower.

359
00:35:46,145 --> 00:35:47,647
I think he was thrown.

360
00:35:49,106 --> 00:35:51,734
The boy was always
surefooted before.

361
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:54,695
Someone tried to kill him twice.

362
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,657
Why? Why murder an innocent child?

363
00:35:57,782 --> 00:36:00,451
Unless he saw something
he wasn't meant to see.

364
00:36:00,576 --> 00:36:03,204
- Saw what, my lady?
- I don't know.

365
00:36:04,664 --> 00:36:07,041
But I would stake my life
the Lannisters are involved.

366
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:10,461
We already have reason to suspect
their loyalty to the Crown.

367
00:36:10,586 --> 00:36:12,797
Did you notice the dagger the killer used?

368
00:36:12,922 --> 00:36:15,216
It's too fine a weapon for such a man.

369
00:36:15,341 --> 00:36:18,594
The blade is Valyrian steel,
the handle dragonbone.

370
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:20,554
Someone gave it to him.

371
00:36:21,806 --> 00:36:25,559
They come into our home
and try to murder my brother?

372
00:36:25,685 --> 00:36:27,144
If it's war they want...

373
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:29,438
If it comes to that,
you know I'll stand behind you.

374
00:36:29,563 --> 00:36:32,692
What, is there going to be
a battle in the Godswood?

375
00:36:32,817 --> 00:36:34,318
Hmm?

376
00:36:34,443 --> 00:36:37,405
Too easily words of war
become acts of war.

377
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:39,532
We don't know the truth yet.

378
00:36:40,116 --> 00:36:41,992
Lord Stark must be told of this.

379
00:36:42,118 --> 00:36:44,912
I don't trust a raven
to carry these words.

380
00:36:45,037 --> 00:36:46,914
- I'll ride to King's Landing.
- No.

381
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:50,209
There must always be a Stark in Winterfell.

382
00:36:50,334 --> 00:36:52,128
- I will go myself.
- Mother, you can't.

383
00:36:52,253 --> 00:36:53,796
I must.

384
00:36:54,922 --> 00:36:57,508
I'll send Hal with a squad
of guardsmen to escort you.

385
00:36:57,633 --> 00:37:00,094
Too large a party attracts unwanted attention.

386
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:02,346
I don't want the Lannisters
to know I'm coming.

387
00:37:02,471 --> 00:37:03,973
Let me accompany you at least.

388
00:37:04,098 --> 00:37:07,101
The Kingsroad can be a dangerous place
for a woman alone.

389
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,232
What about Bran?

390
00:37:14,942 --> 00:37:17,820
I have prayed to the Seven
for more than a month.

391
00:37:19,155 --> 00:37:22,408
Bran's life is in their hands now.

392
00:38:21,467 --> 00:38:23,260
No, Khaleesi.

393
00:38:23,385 --> 00:38:26,222
You must look in his eyes always.

394
00:38:26,347 --> 00:38:28,432
Love comes in at the eyes.

395
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:32,853
It is said that lrogenia of Lys
could finish a man

396
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:34,814
with nothing but her eyes.

397
00:38:34,939 --> 00:38:37,149
Finish a man?

398
00:38:38,734 --> 00:38:40,903
Oh.

399
00:38:42,071 --> 00:38:45,616
Kings traveled across the world
for a night with lrogenia.

400
00:38:45,741 --> 00:38:48,369
Magisters sold their palaces.

401
00:38:48,494 --> 00:38:51,914
Khals burned her enemies
just to have her for a few hours.

402
00:38:52,957 --> 00:38:55,584
They say a thousand men
proposed to her

403
00:38:55,709 --> 00:38:58,754
and she refused them all.

404
00:38:58,879 --> 00:39:02,091
Well, she sounds like
an interesting woman.

405
00:39:02,216 --> 00:39:03,884
I... I don't think

406
00:39:04,009 --> 00:39:06,470
that Drogo will like it with me on top.

407
00:39:06,595 --> 00:39:08,848
You will make him like it, Khaleesi.

408
00:39:08,973 --> 00:39:11,016
Men want what they've never had.

409
00:39:11,141 --> 00:39:14,478
And the Dothraki take slaves like
a hound takes a bitch.

410
00:39:15,938 --> 00:39:17,857
Are you a slave, Khaleesi?

411
00:39:28,868 --> 00:39:31,370
Then don't make love like a slave.

412
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:42,339
Very good, Khaleesi.

413
00:39:42,464 --> 00:39:44,466
Out there he is the mighty khal,

414
00:39:45,134 --> 00:39:48,470
but in this tent, he belongs to you.

415
00:39:49,263 --> 00:39:50,681
I... I don't think

416
00:39:50,806 --> 00:39:53,309
that this is the Dothraki way.

417
00:39:53,434 --> 00:39:55,477
If he wanted the Dothraki way,

418
00:39:56,312 --> 00:39:58,439
why did he marry you?

419
00:40:46,904 --> 00:40:48,238
No.

420
00:40:52,201 --> 00:40:53,702
No!

421
00:40:55,746 --> 00:40:58,707
Tonight I would look upon your face!

422
00:42:45,689 --> 00:42:47,107
Pardon me, ser.

423
00:42:50,986 --> 00:42:53,238
Do I frighten you so much, girl?

424
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:57,826
Or is it him there making you shake?

425
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,370
He frightens me too.

426
00:43:00,496 --> 00:43:02,998
Look at that face.

427
00:43:03,916 --> 00:43:05,667
I'm sorry if I offended you, ser.

428
00:43:12,508 --> 00:43:13,467
Why won't he speak to me?

429
00:43:13,592 --> 00:43:16,553
He hasn't been very talkative
these last 20 years.

430
00:43:16,678 --> 00:43:19,640
Since the Mad King had his tongue
ripped out with hot pincers.

431
00:43:19,765 --> 00:43:22,518
He speaks damn well
with his sword though.

432
00:43:22,643 --> 00:43:26,105
Ser llyn Payne, the King's Justice.

433
00:43:27,731 --> 00:43:29,733
The Royal Executioner.

434
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:34,196
What is it, sweet lady?

435
00:43:35,864 --> 00:43:38,117
Does the hound frighten you?

436
00:43:38,242 --> 00:43:39,701
Away with you, dog.

437
00:43:40,536 --> 00:43:42,246
You're scaring my lady.

438
00:43:44,581 --> 00:43:46,583
I don't like to see you upset.

439
00:43:49,211 --> 00:43:51,004
The sun's finally shining.

440
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:53,674
Come walk with me.

441
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,802
Stay, Lady.

442
00:44:13,569 --> 00:44:15,696
I probably shouldn't have any more.

443
00:44:15,821 --> 00:44:18,115
Father only lets us
have one cup at feasts.

444
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,201
My princess can drink
as much as she wants.

445
00:44:33,755 --> 00:44:36,383
Don't worry. You're safe with me.

446
00:44:37,426 --> 00:44:39,428
I'll get you!

447
00:44:44,725 --> 00:44:46,393
Arya!

448
00:44:46,518 --> 00:44:47,686
Ow!

449
00:44:47,811 --> 00:44:49,479
What are you doing here?

450
00:44:49,605 --> 00:44:51,607
- Go away.
- Your sister?

451
00:44:55,485 --> 00:44:58,322
- And who are you, boy'?
- Mycah, my lord.

452
00:44:58,447 --> 00:45:00,449
- He's the butcher's boy.
- He's my friend.

453
00:45:00,574 --> 00:45:03,911
A butcher's boy who wants
to be a knight, eh?

454
00:45:05,704 --> 00:45:08,332
Pick up your sword, butcher's boy.
Let's see how good you are.

455
00:45:08,457 --> 00:45:11,001
She asked me to, my lord.
She asked me to.

456
00:45:11,126 --> 00:45:14,755
I'm your prince, not your lord,

457
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,634
and I said pick up your sword.

458
00:45:18,759 --> 00:45:20,969
It's not a sword, my prince.
It's only a stick.

459
00:45:21,094 --> 00:45:22,930
And you're not a knight.

460
00:45:24,306 --> 00:45:26,516
Only a butcher's boy.

461
00:45:26,642 --> 00:45:29,561
That was my lady's sister you were hitting.
Do you know that?

462
00:45:29,686 --> 00:45:31,939
- Stop it!
- Arya, stay out of this.

463
00:45:32,606 --> 00:45:35,150
I won't hurt him...

464
00:45:35,275 --> 00:45:36,276
much.

465
00:45:44,868 --> 00:45:45,994
- Arya!

466
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,413
Filthy little bitch!

467
00:45:48,538 --> 00:45:50,374
No, no, stop it, stop it, both of you!

468
00:45:50,499 --> 00:45:53,168
You're spoiling it.
You're spoiling everything!

469
00:45:53,877 --> 00:45:56,338
I'll gut you, you little cunt!

470
00:45:59,216 --> 00:46:01,260
' Arya!
' Nymeria!

471
00:46:01,385 --> 00:46:02,261
Arya!

472
00:46:02,386 --> 00:46:03,845
Nymeria!

473
00:46:08,809 --> 00:46:10,686
No.

474
00:46:10,811 --> 00:46:13,272
No. Please don't.

475
00:46:13,397 --> 00:46:15,691
Arya, leave him alone.

476
00:46:34,418 --> 00:46:37,796
My prince, my poor prince,
look what they did to you.

477
00:46:37,921 --> 00:46:40,299
Stay here. I'll go back to the inn
and bring help.

478
00:46:40,424 --> 00:46:41,591
Then go!

479
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:45,721
Don't touch me.

480
00:46:47,889 --> 00:46:50,809
The wolf's not here.
Look down by the stream.

481
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:00,777
You've got to go. They'll kill you
for what you did to Joffrey.

482
00:47:00,902 --> 00:47:02,988
Go on. Run.

483
00:47:06,199 --> 00:47:08,243
Go! Leave now!

484
00:47:10,662 --> 00:47:12,789
- It's a direwolf.
- I'll check down here.

485
00:47:18,712 --> 00:47:21,965
I think I heard a noise.

486
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:25,135
Go!

487
00:47:37,397 --> 00:47:39,941
'Arya!

488
00:47:40,942 --> 00:47:42,277
Arya!

489
00:47:43,945 --> 00:47:44,946
Arya!

490
00:47:45,739 --> 00:47:47,949
Arya!

491
00:47:49,201 --> 00:47:50,660
Arya!

492
00:47:51,328 --> 00:47:52,954
Arya!

493
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:55,165
My lord!

494
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:57,334
My Lord! They've found her.

495
00:47:57,459 --> 00:47:59,961
- She's unharmed.
-  Arya!

496
00:48:00,087 --> 00:48:02,422
- Where is she?
- She's been taken directly before the king.

497
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:04,341
- Who took her?
- The Lannisters found her.

498
00:48:04,466 --> 00:48:06,593
- Arya!
- Right, get back.

499
00:48:06,718 --> 00:48:09,346
The queen ordered them
to bring her straight to him.

500
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:11,723
Back! Back to the inn!

501
00:48:12,724 --> 00:48:14,476
All back!

502
00:48:22,317 --> 00:48:24,111
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

503
00:48:24,236 --> 00:48:25,779
- Are you hurt?
- No.

504
00:48:25,904 --> 00:48:28,323
Oh, it's all right.

505
00:48:30,117 --> 00:48:32,828
What is the meaning of this?

506
00:48:32,953 --> 00:48:34,955
Why was my daughter
not brought to me at once?

507
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:36,873
How dare you speak to your king
in that manner?

508
00:48:36,998 --> 00:48:38,375
Quiet, woman.

509
00:48:39,668 --> 00:48:42,671
Sorry, Ned. I never meant to frighten the girl.

510
00:48:42,796 --> 00:48:45,090
But we need to get
this business done quickly.

511
00:48:45,841 --> 00:48:48,885
Your girl and that butcher's boy
attacked my son.

512
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:51,138
That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.

513
00:48:51,263 --> 00:48:53,140
That's not true!

514
00:48:53,265 --> 00:48:55,851
She just... bit him a little.

515
00:48:56,685 --> 00:48:59,312
- He was hurting Mycah.
- Joff told us what happened.

516
00:48:59,438 --> 00:49:02,649
You and that boy beat him with clubs
while you set your wolf on him.

517
00:49:02,816 --> 00:49:04,276
That's not what happened!

518
00:49:04,401 --> 00:49:07,571
Yes, it is! They all attacked me
and she threw my sword in the river.

519
00:49:07,696 --> 00:49:08,864
- Liar!
- Shut up!

520
00:49:08,989 --> 00:49:10,365
Enough!

521
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:13,410
He tells me one thing,
she tells me another.

522
00:49:13,535 --> 00:49:15,787
Seven hells!
What am I to make of this?

523
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:20,750
- Where's your other daughter, Ned'?
- In bed, asleep.

524
00:49:20,876 --> 00:49:22,878
She's not.

525
00:49:23,003 --> 00:49:25,380
Sansa, come here, darling.

526
00:49:36,391 --> 00:49:38,226
Now, child...

527
00:49:39,269 --> 00:49:41,188
tell me what happened.

528
00:49:41,313 --> 00:49:43,356
Tell it all and tell it true.

529
00:49:43,482 --> 00:49:45,984
It's a great crime to lie to a king.

530
00:49:54,493 --> 00:49:56,661
I don't know.

531
00:49:56,786 --> 00:49:59,789
I don't remember.
Everything happened so fast.

532
00:50:00,874 --> 00:50:03,210
- I didn't see.
- Liar!

533
00:50:03,335 --> 00:50:04,794
- Liar, liar, liar!
- Arya!

534
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:07,172
- Hey, stop it! That's enough of that.
- Liar, liar, liar!

535
00:50:07,297 --> 00:50:10,759
- Stop! Arya!
- She's as wild as that animal of hers.

536
00:50:10,884 --> 00:50:12,886
- I want her punished.
- What would you have me do,

537
00:50:13,011 --> 00:50:14,429
whip her through the streets?

538
00:50:14,554 --> 00:50:17,599
Damn it, children fight. It's over.

539
00:50:17,724 --> 00:50:20,352
Joffrey will bear these scars
for the rest of his life.

540
00:50:21,978 --> 00:50:25,440
You let that little girl disarm you?

541
00:50:31,696 --> 00:50:34,658
Ned, see to it that your daughter
is disciplined.

542
00:50:34,783 --> 00:50:37,536
- I'll do the same with my son.
- Gladly, Your Grace.

543
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:40,789
And what of the direwolf?

544
00:50:41,581 --> 00:50:44,000
What of the beast
that savaged your son?

545
00:50:47,087 --> 00:50:49,422
I'd forgot the damned wolf.

546
00:50:49,548 --> 00:50:52,217
We found no trace of the direwolf,
Your Grace.

547
00:50:52,342 --> 00:50:55,512
No? So be it.

548
00:50:55,637 --> 00:50:57,722
We have another wolf.

549
00:51:01,142 --> 00:51:02,727
As you will.

550
00:51:02,852 --> 00:51:06,106
- You can't mean it.
- A direwolf's no pet.

551
00:51:06,231 --> 00:51:08,358
Get her a dog.
She'll be happier for it.

552
00:51:09,651 --> 00:51:12,237
He doesn't mean Lady, does he?

553
00:51:12,362 --> 00:51:14,948
No, no, not Lady!
Lady didn't bite anyone!

554
00:51:15,073 --> 00:51:17,158
- She's good!
- Lady wasn't there!

555
00:51:17,284 --> 00:51:20,203
- You leave her alone!
- Stop them. Don't let them do it.

556
00:51:20,328 --> 00:51:22,706
Please, please, it wasn't Lady!

557
00:51:22,831 --> 00:51:24,541
Is this your command?

558
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,168
Your Grace?

559
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:37,137
- Where is the beast?
- Chained up outside, Your Grace.

560
00:51:37,262 --> 00:51:39,222
Ser llyn, do me the honor.

561
00:51:39,347 --> 00:51:40,724
No.

562
00:51:41,766 --> 00:51:43,768
Jgry...

563
00:51:45,228 --> 00:51:47,272
take the girls to their rooms.

564
00:51:51,568 --> 00:51:53,987
If it must be done,

565
00:51:54,112 --> 00:51:56,072
then I'll do it myself.

566
00:51:56,197 --> 00:51:58,241
Is this some trick?

567
00:51:58,366 --> 00:52:00,410
The wolf is of the North.

568
00:52:01,953 --> 00:52:04,372
She deserves better than a butcher

569
00:52:37,822 --> 00:52:41,409
The butcher's boy -
you rode him down'?

570
00:52:41,534 --> 00:52:43,536
He ran.

571
00:52:43,662 --> 00:52:45,246
Not very fast.

574
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,065
