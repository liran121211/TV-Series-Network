1
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:24,116
<font color="#ffff00">My lord...</font>

2
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,744
<font color="#ffff00">My sun and stars...</font>

3
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:43,969
<font color="#ffff00">My horse...</font>

4
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,930
<font color="#ffff00">Blood of my blood...</font>

5
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:49,934
<font color="#ffff00">No, I must ride.</font>

6
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:52,436
<font color="#ffff00">He fell from his horse.</font>

7
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:57,149
<font color="#ffff00">A Khal who cannot ride is no Khal.</font>

8
00:21:57,274 --> 00:22:00,361
<font color="#ffff00">He's tired, that's all.
He needs to rest.</font>

9
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:04,698
<font color="#ffff00">We've ridden far enough today.
We'll camp here.</font>

10
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:07,034
<font color="#ffff00">This is no place to camp.</font>

11
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,329
<font color="#ffff00">A woman does not give us orders.
Not even a Khaleesi.</font>

12
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:14,416
<font color="#ffff00">We'll camp here.
Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it.</font>

13
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:17,086
<font color="#ffff00">You do not command me, Khaleesi.</font>

14
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,339
<font color="#ffff00">Find Mirri Maz Duur.
Bring her to me.</font>

15
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:23,050
<font color="#ffff00">The witch?
I'll bring you her head, Khaleesi.</font>

16
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:28,931
<font color="#ffff00">Bring her to me unharmed or Khal Drogo
will hear why you denied me.</font>

17
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:12,167
<font color="#ffff00">You did this, witch.</font>

18
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,086
<font color="#ffff00">Stop it!</font>

19
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:15,754
<font color="#ffff00">I don't want her hurt.</font>

20
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:21,051
<font color="#ffff00">No? No? You don't want her hurt?</font>

21
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:29,017
<font color="#ffff00">Pray we don't hurt you, too.
You let this witch put her hands on our Khal.</font>

22
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:32,771
<font color="#ffff00">Rein in your tongue.
She is still your Khaleesi.</font>

23
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:35,691
<font color="#ffff00">Only while the blood of my blood lives.</font>

24
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:43,615
<font color="#ffff00">When he dies, she is nothing.</font>

25
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:54,751
<font color="#ffff00">I have never been nothing.
I am the blood of the dragon.</font>

26
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:02,259
<font color="#ffff00">The dragons are all dead, Khaleesi.</font>

27
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:23,710
<font color="#ffff00">This must not be.</font>

28
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,337
<font color="#ffff00">This must be.</font>

29
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:26,671
<font color="#ffff00">Witch.</font>

30
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,634
<font color="#ffff00">No, you can't.</font>

31
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:36,473
<font color="#ffff00">No further, horselord.</font>
