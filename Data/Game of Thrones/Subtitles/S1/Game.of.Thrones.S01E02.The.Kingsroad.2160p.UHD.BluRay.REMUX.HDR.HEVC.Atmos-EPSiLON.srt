1
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:15,260
You need to drink, child.

2
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,642
And eat.

3
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,689
Isn't there anything else?

4
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:32,861
The Dothraki have two things
in abundance - grass and horses.

5
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,197
People can't live on grass.

6
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,833
In the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai,

7
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,294
they say there are fields of ghost grass

8
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:52,631
with stalks as pale as milk
that glow in the night.

9
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:55,175
It murders all other grass.

10
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,719
The Dothraki believe that one day

11
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,931
it will cover everything - that's
the way the world will end.

12
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,780
It'll get easier.

13
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:55,527
Khaleesi!

14
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,487
Your hands.

15
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:11,042
We're still not far from Pentos, Your Grace.

16
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:13,545
Master Illyrio has extended his hospitality.

17
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,338
You'd be more comfortable there.

18
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:18,216
I have no interest
in hospitality or comfort.

19
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:22,596
I'll stay with Drogo until he fulfills his end
of the bargain and I have my crown.

20
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,973
As you wish, Your Grace.

21
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:28,351
Well, Mormont, as brutish as this life is,

22
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:30,645
I suppose it is preferable to beheading.

23
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:34,316
What did Ned Stark want you for?

24
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,611
Buying from a slaver?

25
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:39,654
Selling to one.

26
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,698
Some poachers I caught on my land.

27
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:47,204
Under my reign, you won't be
punished for such nonsense.

28
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,164
You can rest assured of that.

29
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:16,441
Better-looking bitches than
you're used to, Uncle.

30
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,281
My mother's been looking for you.

31
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,575
We ride for King's Landing today.

32
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,662
Before you go, you will call
on Lord and Lady Stark

33
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:31,122
and offer your sympathies.

34
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:33,625
What good will my sympathies do them?

35
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:38,338
None. But it is expected of you.

36
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,382
Your absence has already been noted.

37
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,467
The boy means nothing to me.

38
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,928
And I can't stand the wailing of women.

39
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:49,057
One word and I'll hit you again.

40
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,767
I'm telling Mother!

41
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:54,271
Go! Tell her.

42
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:56,439
But first you will get
to Lord and Lady Stark

43
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:58,483
and you will fall on your
knees in front of them

44
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:01,403
and tell them how very sorry you are,
that you are at their service,

45
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:04,739
and that all your prayers are with them.
Do you understand?

46
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:07,033
You can't...

47
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,618
Do you understand?

48
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,669
The Prince will remember that, little lord.

49
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,713
I hope so.

50
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:23,133
If he forgets, be a good
dog and remind him.

51
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:29,055
Ah. Time for breakfast.

52
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,274
Bread. And two of those little fish.

53
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,652
And a mug of dark beer to wash it down.

54
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,365
And bacon, burnt black.

55
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,367
Hyah.

56
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:52,329
- Little brother.
- Beloved siblings.

57
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,668
Is Bran going to die?

58
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:01,671
Apparently not.

59
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:08,428
- What do you mean?
- The maester says the boy may live.

60
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:19,564
It's no mercy, letting
a child linger in such pain.

61
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,441
Only the gods know for certain.

62
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,944
All the rest of us can do is pray.

63
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,989
The charms of the North
seem entirely lost on you.

64
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,783
I still can't believe you're going.

65
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,952
It's ridiculous, even for you.

66
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,787
Where's your sense of wonder?

67
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:37,999
The greatest structure ever built,
the intrepid men of the Night's Watch,

68
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,377
the wintry abode of the white walkers.

69
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:43,588
Tell me you're not thinking
of taking the black.

70
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,591
And go celibate?
The whores would go begging

71
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,593
from Dorne to Casterly Rock.

72
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,804
No, I just want to stand
on top of the Wall

73
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:52,722
and piss off the edge of the world.

74
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,810
The children don't need to hear your filth.

75
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,480
Come.

76
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:10,281
Even if the boy lives,
he'll be a cripple, a grotesque.

77
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:12,867
Give me a good, clean death any day.

78
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:17,747
Speaking for the grotesques,
I'd have to disagree.

79
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,625
Death is so final, whereas life...

80
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,919
ah, life is full of possibilities.

81
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:28,550
I hope the boy does wake. I'd be very
interested to hear what he has to say.

82
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,929
My dear brother,

83
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,724
there are times you make me
wonder whose side you're on.

84
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,976
My dear brother, you wound me.

85
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,562
You know how much I love my family.

86
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:01,124
Please.

87
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:04,544
Oh, I would have dressed, Your Grace.

88
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,963
This is your home. I'm your guest.

89
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,343
Handsome one, isn't he?

90
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:17,599
I lost my first boy,
a little black-haired beauty.

91
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,601
He was a fighter too -

92
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,811
tried to beat the fever that took him.

93
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,899
Forgive me.

94
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:27,901
It's the last thing you
need to hear right now.

95
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:30,028
I never knew.

96
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:32,030
It was years ago.

97
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:37,035
Robert was crazed, beat his
hands bloody on the wall,

98
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,497
all the things men do to show
you how much they care.

99
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,504
The boy looked just like him.

100
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,007
Such a little thing.

101
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:54,219
A bird without feathers.

102
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,390
They came to take his body away

103
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:04,145
and Robert held me.
I screamed and I battled, but he held me.

104
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,194
That little bundle.

105
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,406
They took him away and
I never saw him again.

106
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,867
Never have visited the crypt, never.

107
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,505
I pray to the Mother
every morning and night

108
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,757
that she return your child to you.

109
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,594
I am grateful.

110
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,514
Perhaps this time she'll listen.

111
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,651
A sword for the Wall?

112
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:37,864
- I already have one.
- Good man.

113
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:40,658
- Have you swung it yet?
- Of course I have.

114
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,285
At someone, I mean.

115
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:50,418
It's a strange thing,
the first time you cut a man.

116
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,713
You realize we're nothing
but sacks of meat and blood,

117
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:56,633
and some bone to keep it all standing.

118
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,012
Let me thank you ahead of time

119
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,890
for guarding us all from
the perils beyond the Wall -

120
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:06,517
wildlings and white walkers and whatnot.

121
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:12,774
We're grateful to have good,
strong men like you protecting us.

122
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,987
We've guarded the Kingdoms
for 8,000 years.

123
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,243
Is it "we" already?

124
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,204
Have you taken your vows, then?

125
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:27,705
Soon enough.

126
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,377
Give my regards to the Night's Watch.

127
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:36,547
I'm sure it will be thrilling to serve
in such an elite force. And if not...

128
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:40,009
it's only for life.

129
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:01,406
Thank you, Nymeria.

130
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,165
Septa Mordane says
I have to do it again.

131
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,002
My things weren't properly
folded, she says.

132
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:17,088
Who cares how they're folded?
They're going to get all messed up anyway.

133
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,382
It's good you've got help.

134
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,092
Watch.

135
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,136
Nymeria, gloves.

136
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,519
- Impressive.
- Shut up.

137
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,604
Nymeria, gloves!

138
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,775
I have something for you.

139
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,236
And it has to be packed very carefully.

140
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:41,946
A present?

141
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,032
Close the door.

142
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,921
This is no toy.

143
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:04,427
Be careful you don't cut yourself.

144
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,390
- It's so skinny.
- So are you.

145
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,560
I had the blacksmith
make it for you special.

146
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:13,895
It won't hack a man's head off,

147
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,897
but it can poke him full of holes
if you're quick enough.

148
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,691
- I can be quick.
- You'll have to work at it every day.

149
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,611
How does it feel?

150
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,822
Do you like the balance?

151
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,449
I think so.

152
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:30,328
First lesson - stick them with the pointy end.

153
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:32,330
I know which end to use.

154
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:39,879
I'm going to miss you.

155
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,840
Careful.

156
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:57,021
All the best swords have names, you know.

157
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,318
Sansa can keep her sewing needles.

158
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,988
I've got a needle of my own.

159
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,839
I came to say goodbye to Bran.

160
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:24,590
You've said it.

161
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:38,312
I wish I could be here when you wake up.

162
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,152
I'm going north with Uncle Benjen.

163
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:45,611
I'm taking the black.

164
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:57,373
I know we always talked about
seeing the Wall together,

165
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:01,127
but you'll be able to come visit me
at Castle Black when you're better.

166
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,756
I'll know my way around by then.

167
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:08,217
I'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch.

168
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:16,309
We can go out walking beyond
the Wall, if you're not afraid.

169
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:33,868
I want you...

170
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,661
to leave.

171
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,931
17 years ago

172
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,475
you rode off with Robert Baratheon.

173
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:45,022
You came back a year later
with another woman's son.

174
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:49,235
And now you're leaving again.

175
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:53,698
I have no choice.

176
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:57,702
That's what men always
say when honor calls.

177
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:01,163
That's what you tell your
families, tell yourselves.

178
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:05,167
You do have a choice.

179
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,837
And you've made it.

180
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:13,926
Cat...

181
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:21,475
I can't do it, Ned.

182
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,397
I really can't.

183
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,982
You can.

184
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:31,694
You must.

185
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:58,012
You've said goodbye to Bran?

186
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,139
He's not going to die. I know it.

187
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,433
You Starks are hard to kill.

188
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:04,977
My mother?

189
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,647
- She was very kind.
- Good.

190
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,651
Next time I see you,
you'll be all in black.

191
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:13,861
It was always my color.

192
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,822
Farewell, Snow.

193
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,574
And you, Stark.

194
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,129
There's great honor serving
in the Night's Watch.

195
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:18,759
The Starks have manned the Wall
for thousands of years.

196
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:21,679
And you are a Stark.

197
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:23,889
You might not have my name,

198
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,016
but you have my blood.

199
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,650
Is my mother alive?

200
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:38,946
Does she know about me?
Where I am, where I'm going?

201
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:41,657
Does she care?

202
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:45,953
The next time we see each other,

203
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,122
we'll talk about your mother.

204
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,999
Hmm?

205
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:51,584
I promise.

206
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:34,168
Gods, this is country!

207
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:39,465
I've half a mind to leave them
all behind and keep going.

208
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,928
I've half a mind to go with you.

209
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:48,766
What do you say, just you and me
on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides,

210
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:52,186
a couple of tavern wenches
to warm our beds tonight.

211
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,980
You should have asked me 20 years ago.

212
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:57,858
There were wars to fight,
women to marry -

213
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,236
we never had the chance to be young.

214
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:01,987
I recall a few chances.

215
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:08,494
There was that one...
Oh, what was her name?

216
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:10,538
That common girl of yours?

217
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:13,457
Becca. With the great big tits
you could bury your face in.

218
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,793
Bessie. She was one of yours.

219
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:19,588
Bessie! Thank the gods for Bessie.

220
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,298
And her tits.

221
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,760
Yours was, er... Aleena?

222
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:27,763
No. You told me once. Er... Meryl?

223
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,849
Your bastard's mother?

224
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:33,811
- Wylla.
- That's it.

225
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:36,021
She must have been a rare wench

226
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:39,024
to make Lord Eddard Stark
forget his honor.

227
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,193
You never told me what she looked like.

228
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:43,487
Nor will I.

229
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:47,992
We were at war.

230
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:50,911
None of us knew if we were
gonna go back home again.

231
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:54,039
You're too hard on yourself.
You always have been.

232
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:59,211
I swear if I weren't your king,
you'd have hit me already.

233
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:02,673
The worst thing about your coronation -

234
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,800
I'll never get to hit you again.

235
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:09,597
Trust me, that's not the worst thing.

236
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,603
There was a rider in the night.

237
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:25,195
Daenerys Targaryen has wed
some Dothraki horselord.

238
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:27,156
What of it? Do we send her
a wedding gift?

239
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:29,575
A knife perhaps, a good, sharp one,

240
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,702
and a bold man to wield it.

241
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,621
She's little more than a child.

242
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:36,999
Soon enough that child will spread
her legs and start breeding.

243
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:40,753
- Tell me we're not speaking of this.
- Oh, it's unspeakable to you?

244
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:44,173
What her father did to your family -
that was unspeakable.

245
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:46,592
What Rhaegar Targaryen
did to your sister -

246
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:48,719
the woman I loved.

247
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:51,889
I'll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on.

248
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:53,974
But you can't get your hands
on this one, can you?

249
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,685
This Khal Drogo,

250
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,687
it's said he has 100,000
men in his horde.

251
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:01,565
Even a million Dothraki are
no threat to the realm,

252
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,276
as long as they remain on the
other side of the Narrow Sea.

253
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,362
They have no ships, Robert.

254
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:09,448
There are still those in the Seven
Kingdoms who call me usurper.

255
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:14,286
If the Targaryen boy crosses
with a Dothraki horde at his back,

256
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:17,081
- the scum will join him.
- He will not cross.

257
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:21,919
And if by chance he does,
we'll throw him back into the sea.

258
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:29,009
There's a war coming, Ned.

259
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:33,263
I don't know when, I don't
know who we'll be fighting,

260
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:34,848
but it's coming.

261
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,672
Sit.

262
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,549
You'll be fed.

263
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,346
Untie them.

264
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:59,683
Ah, rapers.

265
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:05,647
They were given a choice,
no doubt - castration or the Wall.

266
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:08,025
Most choose the knife.

267
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:15,574
Not impressed by your new brothers?

268
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,329
Lovely thing about the Watch -

269
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:23,749
you discard your old family
and get a whole new one.

270
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,635
Why do you read so much?

271
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,888
Look at me and tell me what you see.

272
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:41,100
Is this a trick?

273
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:44,937
What you see is a dwarf.

274
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:48,232
If I'd been born a peasant they might've
left me out in the woods to die.

275
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:52,486
Alas, I was born a Lannister
of Casterly Rock.

276
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,571
Things are expected of me.

277
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:57,116
My father was the Hand
of the King for 20 years.

278
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:59,284
Until your brother killed that king.

279
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:08,794
Yes, until my brother killed him.

280
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:13,382
Life is full of these little ironies.

281
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:17,136
My sister married the new king, and...

282
00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:19,721
my repulsive nephew
will be king after him.

283
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:25,602
I must do my part for the honor
of my house. Wouldn't you agree?

284
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:29,314
But how?

285
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:32,192
Well, my brother has his sword

286
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,610
and I have my mind,

287
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:37,739
and a mind needs books like
a sword needs a whetstone.

288
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:40,534
That's why I read so much, Jon Snow.

289
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:46,456
And you?

290
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:48,709
What's your story, bastard?

291
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:53,881
Ask me nicely and maybe
I'll tell you, dwarf.

292
00:27:57,968 --> 00:28:00,721
A bastard boy with nothing to inherit,

293
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:05,267
off to join the ancient order
of the Night's Watch,

294
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:09,188
alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms.

295
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:10,939
The Night's Watch protects
the realm from...

296
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:14,401
Ah, yes, yes, against
grumpkins and snarks

297
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:18,030
and all the other monsters your
wet nurse warned you about.

298
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:20,449
You're a smart boy.

299
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:22,993
You don't believe that nonsense.

300
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:33,462
Everything's better
with some wine in the belly.

301
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:12,042
It's time we reviewed
the accounts, my lady.

302
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:15,963
You'll want to know how much
this royal visit has cost us.

303
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,466
Talk to Poole about it.

304
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:24,721
Poole went south
with Lord Stark, my lady.

305
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,349
We need a new steward,

306
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:30,560
and there are several other
appointments that require

307
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:34,564
- our immediate attention.
- I don't care about appointments!

308
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:37,818
I'll make the appointments.

309
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:42,572
We'll talk about it first
thing in the morning.

310
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:44,700
Very good, my lord.

311
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:48,412
My lady.

312
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,760
When was the last time
you left this room?

313
00:30:05,095 --> 00:30:06,346
I have to take care of him.

314
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,181
He's not going to die, Mother.

315
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:10,100
Maester Luwin says the most
dangerous time has passed.

316
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:11,268
What if he's wrong?

317
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:14,813
- Bran needs me.
- Rickon needs you.

318
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,649
He's six.

319
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:20,986
He doesn't know what's happening.
He follows me around all day,

320
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:23,405
- clutching my leg, crying...
- Close the windows!

321
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,532
I can't stand it!
Please make them stop!

322
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:30,912
Fire.

323
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,166
You stay here. I'll come back.

324
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,394
You're not supposed to be here.

325
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,147
No one is supposed to be here.

326
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:59,524
It's a mercy.

327
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:01,485
He's dead already.

328
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:04,988
No!

329
00:32:12,139 --> 00:32:15,809
- Have you ever seen a dragon?
- Dragon gone, Khaleesi.

330
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:18,770
Everywhere? Even in the East?

331
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:21,898
No dragon. Brave men kill them.

332
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:24,943
- It is known.
- It is known.

333
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:28,947
A trader from Qarth told me
that dragons come from the moon.

334
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,199
The moon?

335
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:33,952
He told me the moon
was an egg, Khaleesi,

336
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:36,621
that once there were two moons in the sky.

337
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:40,667
But one wandered too close to the sun
and it cracked from the heat,

338
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,753
and out of it poured
a thousand thousand dragons

339
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:45,714
and they drank the sun's fire.

340
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:48,800
Moon is no egg.

341
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:51,678
Moon is goddess - wife of sun.

342
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,347
- It is known.
- It is known.

343
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:57,767
Leave me with her.

344
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:09,654
Why did the trader from Qarth
tell you these stories?

345
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:12,324
Men like to talk when they're happy.

346
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:16,495
Before your brother bought me for you,
it was my job to make men happy.

347
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,830
How old were you?

348
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:21,500
I was nine when my mother
sold me to the pleasure house.

349
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:23,210
Nine?!

350
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:27,255
I did not touch a man
for three years, Khaleesi.

351
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,217
First you must learn.

352
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:36,556
Can you teach me how
to make the khal happy?

353
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:39,726
Yes.

354
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,603
Will it take three years?

355
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:44,689
No.

356
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:07,837
Welcome.

357
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:42,307
What I am about to tell you
must remain between us.

358
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:46,394
I don't think Bran fell from that tower.

359
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,648
I think he was thrown.

360
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:53,735
The boy was always surefooted before.

361
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,696
Someone tried to kill him twice.

362
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,658
Why? Why murder an innocent child?

363
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:02,452
Unless he saw something
he wasn't meant to see.

364
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:05,205
- Saw what, my lady?
- I don't know.

365
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:09,042
But I would stake my life
the Lannisters are involved.

366
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:12,462
We already have reason to suspect
their loyalty to the Crown.

367
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,798
Did you notice the dagger
the killer used?

368
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:17,217
It's too fine a weapon for such a man.

369
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:20,595
The blade is Valyrian steel,
the handle dragonbone.

370
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,555
Someone gave it to him.

371
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:27,560
They come into our home and
try to murder my brother?

372
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,145
If it's war they want...

373
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,439
if it comes to that, you know
I'll stand behind you.

374
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:34,693
What, is there going to be
a battle in the Godswood?

375
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:36,319
Hmm?

376
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:39,406
Too easily words of war
become acts of war.

377
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:41,533
We don't know the truth yet.

378
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:43,993
Lord Stark must be told of this.

379
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:46,913
I don't trust a raven
to carry these words.

380
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,915
- I'll ride to King's Landing.
- No.

381
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,210
There must always be a Stark in Winterfell.

382
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:54,129
- I will go myself.
- Mother, you can't.

383
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:55,797
I must.

384
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:59,509
I'll send Hal with a squad
of guardsmen to escort you.

385
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,095
Too large a party attracts
unwanted attention.

386
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,347
I don't want the Lannisters
to know I'm coming.

387
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:05,974
Let me accompany you at least.

388
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:09,102
The Kingsroad can be a dangerous
place for a woman alone.

389
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:15,233
What about Bran?

390
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:19,821
I have prayed to the Seven
for more than a month.

391
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:24,409
Bran's life is in their hands now.

392
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:25,261
No, Khaleesi.

393
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:28,223
You must look in his eyes always.

394
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:30,433
Love comes in at the eyes.

395
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,854
It is said that Irogenia of Lys
could finish a man

396
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,815
with nothing but her eyes.

397
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,150
Finish a man?

398
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,904
Oh.

399
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:47,617
Kings traveled across the world
for a night with Irogenia.

400
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:50,370
Magisters sold their palaces.

401
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:53,915
Khals burned her enemies just
to have her for a few hours.

402
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:57,585
They say a thousand men proposed to her

403
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,755
and she refused them all.

404
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,092
Well, she sounds like an interesting woman.

405
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:05,885
I... I don't think

406
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,471
that Drogo will like it with me on top.

407
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,849
You will make him like it, Khaleesi.

408
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:13,017
Men want what they've never had.

409
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:16,479
And the Dothraki take slaves
like a hound takes a bitch.

410
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:19,858
Are you a slave, Khaleesi?

411
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:33,371
Then don't make love like a slave.

412
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:44,340
Very good, Khaleesi.

413
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:46,467
Out there he is the mighty khal,

414
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:50,471
but in this tent, he belongs to you.

415
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:52,682
I... I don't think

416
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:55,310
that this is the Dothraki way.

417
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:57,478
If he wanted the Dothraki way,

418
00:39:58,313 --> 00:40:00,440
why did he marry you?

419
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:50,239
No.

420
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:55,703
No!

421
00:40:57,747 --> 00:41:00,708
<font color="#ffff00">Tonight I would look upon your face!</font>

422
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,108
Pardon me, ser.

423
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:55,239
Do I frighten you so much, girl?

424
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:59,827
Or is it him there making you shake?

425
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:02,371
He frightens me too.

426
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:04,999
Look at that face.

427
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:07,668
I'm sorry if I offended you, ser.

428
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:15,468
Why won't he speak to me?

429
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:18,554
He hasn't been very talkative
these last 20 years.

430
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:21,641
Since the Mad King had his tongue
ripped out with hot pincers.

431
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:24,519
He speaks damn well
with his sword though.

432
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:28,106
Ser Ilyn Payne, the King's Justice.

433
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:31,734
The Royal Executioner.

434
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:36,197
What is it, sweet lady?

435
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:40,118
Does the hound frighten you?

436
00:43:40,243 --> 00:43:41,702
Away with you, dog.

437
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:44,247
You're scaring my lady.

438
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:48,584
I don't like to see you upset.

439
00:43:51,212 --> 00:43:53,005
The sun's finally shining.

440
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,675
Come walk with me.

441
00:43:56,801 --> 00:43:58,803
Stay, Lady.

442
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,697
I probably shouldn't have any more.

443
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:20,116
Father only lets us have
one cup at feasts.

444
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:23,202
My princess can drink
as much as she wants.

445
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:38,384
Don't worry. You're safe with me.

446
00:44:39,427 --> 00:44:41,429
I'll get you!

447
00:44:46,726 --> 00:44:48,394
Arya!

448
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:49,687
Ow!

449
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:51,480
What are you doing here?

450
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:53,608
- Go away.
- Your sister?

451
00:44:57,486 --> 00:45:00,323
- And who are you, boy?
- Mycah, my lord.

452
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:02,450
- He's the butcher's boy.
- He's my friend.

453
00:45:02,575 --> 00:45:05,912
A butcher's boy who wants
to be a knight, eh?

454
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:10,333
Pick up your sword, butcher's boy.
Let's see how good you are.

455
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:13,002
She asked me to, my lord.
She asked me to.

456
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:16,756
I'm your prince, not your lord,

457
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:20,635
and I said pick up your sword.

458
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,970
It's not a sword, my prince.
It's only a stick.

459
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:24,931
And you're not a knight.

460
00:45:26,307 --> 00:45:28,517
Only a butcher's boy.

461
00:45:28,643 --> 00:45:31,562
That was my lady's sister you were hitting.
Do you know that?

462
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:33,940
- Stop it!
- Arya, stay out of this.

463
00:45:34,607 --> 00:45:37,151
I won't hurt him...

464
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:38,277
much.

465
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:47,995
Arya!

466
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:50,414
Filthy little bitch!

467
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:52,375
No, no, stop it, stop it, both of you!

468
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,169
You're spoiling it.
You're spoiling everything!

469
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:58,339
I'll gut you, you little cunt!

470
00:46:01,217 --> 00:46:03,261
- Arya!
- Nymeria!

471
00:46:03,386 --> 00:46:04,262
Arya!

472
00:46:04,387 --> 00:46:05,846
Nymeria!

473
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:12,687
No.

474
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:15,273
No. Please don't.

475
00:46:15,398 --> 00:46:17,692
Arya, leave him alone.

476
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:39,797
My prince, my poor prince,
look what they did to you.

477
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:42,300
Stay here. I'll go back
to the inn and bring help.

478
00:46:42,425 --> 00:46:43,592
Then go!

479
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:47,722
Don't touch me.

480
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:52,810
The wolf's not here.
Look down by the stream.

481
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:02,778
You've got to go. They'll kill you
for what you did to Joffrey.

482
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:04,989
Go on. Run.

483
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,244
Go! Leave now!

484
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,790
- It's a direwolf.
- I'll check down here.

485
00:47:20,713 --> 00:47:23,966
I think I heard a noise.

486
00:47:25,301 --> 00:47:27,136
Go!

487
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:41,942
Arya!

488
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:44,278
Arya!

489
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:46,947
Arya!

490
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:49,950
Arya!

491
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:52,661
Arya!

492
00:47:53,329 --> 00:47:54,955
Arya!

493
00:47:55,081 --> 00:47:57,166
My lord!

494
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:59,335
My Lord! They've found her.

495
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,962
- She's unharmed.
- Arya!

496
00:48:02,088 --> 00:48:04,423
- Where is she?
- She's been taken directly before the king.

497
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:06,342
- Who took her?
- The Lannisters found her.

498
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:08,594
- Arya!
- Right, get back.

499
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:11,347
The queen ordered them
to bring her straight to him.

500
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:13,724
Back! Back to the inn!

501
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:16,477
All back!

502
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:26,112
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

503
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:27,780
- Are you hurt?
- No.

504
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:30,324
Oh, it's all right.

505
00:48:32,118 --> 00:48:34,829
What is the meaning of this?

506
00:48:34,954 --> 00:48:36,956
Why was my daughter
not brought to me at once?

507
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:38,874
How dare you speak
to your king in that manner?

508
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:40,376
Quiet, woman.

509
00:48:41,669 --> 00:48:44,672
Sorry, Ned. I never meant
to frighten the girl.

510
00:48:44,797 --> 00:48:47,091
But we need to get this
business done quickly.

511
00:48:47,842 --> 00:48:50,886
Your girl and that butcher's boy
attacked my son.

512
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:53,139
That animal of hers
nearly tore his arm off.

513
00:48:53,264 --> 00:48:55,141
That's not true!

514
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:57,852
She just... bit him a little.

515
00:48:58,686 --> 00:49:01,313
- He was hurting Mycah.
- Joff told us what happened.

516
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:04,650
You and that boy beat him with clubs
while you set your wolf on him.

517
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:06,277
That's not what happened!

518
00:49:06,402 --> 00:49:09,572
Yes, it is! They all attacked me
and she threw my sword in the river.

519
00:49:09,697 --> 00:49:10,865
- Liar!
- Shut up!

520
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:12,366
Enough!

521
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:15,411
He tells me one thing,
she tells me another.

522
00:49:15,536 --> 00:49:17,788
Seven hells! What am I to make of this?

523
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,751
- Where's your other daughter, Ned?
- In bed, asleep.

524
00:49:22,877 --> 00:49:24,879
She's not.

525
00:49:25,004 --> 00:49:27,381
Sansa, come here, darling.

526
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:40,227
Now, child...

527
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:43,189
tell me what happened.

528
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:45,357
Tell it all and tell it true.

529
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:47,985
It's a great crime to lie to a king.

530
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:58,662
I don't know.

531
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:01,790
I don't remember.
Everything happened so fast.

532
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:05,211
- I didn't see.
- Liar!

533
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:06,795
- Liar, liar, liar!
- Arya!

534
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:09,173
- Hey, stop it! That's enough of that.
- Liar, liar, liar!

535
00:50:09,298 --> 00:50:12,760
- Stop! Arya!
- She's as wild as that animal of hers.

536
00:50:12,885 --> 00:50:14,887
- I want her punished.
- What would you have me do,

537
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:16,430
whip her through the streets?

538
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:19,600
Damn it, children fight. It's over.

539
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:22,353
Joffrey will bear these scars
for the rest of his life.

540
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:27,441
You let that little girl disarm you?

541
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:36,659
Ned, see to it that your
daughter is disciplined.

542
00:50:36,784 --> 00:50:39,537
- I'll do the same with my son.
- Gladly, Your Grace.

543
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:42,790
And what of the direwolf?

544
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:46,001
What of the beast that
savaged your son?

545
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:51,423
I'd forgot the damned wolf.

546
00:50:51,549 --> 00:50:54,218
We found no trace of the direwolf,
Your Grace.

547
00:50:54,343 --> 00:50:57,513
No? So be it.

548
00:50:57,638 --> 00:50:59,723
We have another wolf.

549
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:04,728
As you will.

550
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:08,107
- You can't mean it.
- A direwolf's no pet.

551
00:51:08,232 --> 00:51:10,359
Get her a dog.
She'll be happier for it.

552
00:51:11,652 --> 00:51:14,238
He doesn't mean Lady, does he?

553
00:51:14,363 --> 00:51:16,949
No, no, not Lady!
Lady didn't bite anyone!

554
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:19,159
- She's good!
- Lady wasn't there!

555
00:51:19,285 --> 00:51:22,204
- You leave her alone!
- Stop them. Don't let them do it.

556
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:24,707
Please, please, it wasn't Lady!

557
00:51:24,832 --> 00:51:26,542
Is this your command?

558
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:29,169
Your Grace?

559
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:39,138
- Where is the beast?
- Chained up outside, Your Grace.

560
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:41,223
Ser Ilyn, do me the honor.

561
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:42,725
No.

562
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,769
Jory...

563
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:49,273
take the girls to their rooms.

564
00:51:53,569 --> 00:51:55,988
if it must be done,

565
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:58,073
then I'll do it myself.

566
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:00,242
Is this some trick?

567
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:02,411
The wolf is of the North.

568
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:06,373
She deserves better than a butcher.

569
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:43,410
The butcher's boy - you rode him down?

570
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:45,537
He ran.

571
00:52:45,663 --> 00:52:47,247
Not very fast.
