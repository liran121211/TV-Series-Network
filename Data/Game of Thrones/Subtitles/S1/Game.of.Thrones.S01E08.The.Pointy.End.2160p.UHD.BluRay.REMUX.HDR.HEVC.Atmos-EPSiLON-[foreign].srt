1
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:40,182
<font color="#ffff00">Lamb men make good slaves.</font>

2
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:42,935
<font color="#ffff00">Khal Drogo will make a gift
of them to the slavers,</font>

3
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,062
<font color="#ffff00">and the slavers will give us gold...</font>

4
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:52,611
<font color="#ffff00">...and silk, and steel.</font>

5
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:29,356
<font color="#ffff00">She is a lamb girl, Khaleesi.</font>

6
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,567
<font color="#ffff00">The riders do her honor.</font>

7
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:33,944
<font color="#ffff00">If her wailing offends the Khaleesi,</font>

8
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,113
<font color="#ffff00">I will bring you her tongue.</font>

9
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:49,001
<font color="#ffff00">Do as I command or Khal Drogo
will know the reason why.</font>

10
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:41,261
<font color="#ffff00">Moon of my life,</font>

11
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:45,390
<font color="#ffff00">Mago says you haven taken his spoils,</font>

12
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:48,936
<font color="#ffff00">a daughter of a lamb man
who was his to mount.</font>

13
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:51,855
<font color="#ffff00">Tell me the truth of this.</font>

14
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:57,694
<font color="#ffff00">Mago speaks the truth,
my sun and stars.</font>

15
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,781
<font color="#ffff00">I have claimed many daughters this day...</font>

16
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:02,449
<font color="#ffff00">...so they cannot be mounted.</font>

17
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:07,996
<font color="#ffff00">This is the way of war.</font>

18
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:10,040
<font color="#ffff00">These women are slaves now...</font>

19
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:13,418
<font color="#ffff00">...to do with as we please.</font>

20
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,797
<font color="#ffff00">It pleases me to keep them safe.</font>

21
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:20,926
<font color="#ffff00">If your riders would mount them,
let them take them for wives.</font>

22
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:25,138
<font color="#ffff00">Does the horse mate with the lamb?</font>

23
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:29,142
<font color="#ffff00">The dragon feeds on horse and lamb alike.</font>

24
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,645
<font color="#ffff00">You are a foreigner.</font>

25
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,814
<font color="#ffff00">You do not command me.</font>

26
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:37,818
<font color="#ffff00">I am Khaleesi. I do command you.</font>

27
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,155
<font color="#ffff00">See how fierce she grows?</font>

28
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:46,618
<font color="#ffff00">That is my son inside her,
the stallion that will mount the world,</font>

29
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:50,122
<font color="#ffff00">filling her with his fire.</font>

30
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,250
<font color="#ffff00">I will hear no more.</font>

31
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:55,877
<font color="#ffff00">Mago, find somewhere else
to stick your cock.</font>

32
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:02,551
<font color="#ffff00">A Khal who takes orders from
a foreign whore is no Khal.</font>

33
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:18,525
<font color="#ffff00">I will not have your body burned.</font>

34
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:22,446
<font color="#ffff00">I will not give you that honor.</font>

35
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,077
<font color="#ffff00">The beetles will feed on your eyes.</font>

36
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:32,331
<font color="#ffff00">The worms will crawl through your lungs.</font>

37
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:42,382
<font color="#ffff00">The rain will fall on your rotting skin...</font>

38
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:48,013
<font color="#ffff00">...until nothing is left of you but bones.</font>

39
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,517
<font color="#ffff00">First you have to kill me.</font>

40
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:54,686
<font color="#ffff00">I already have.</font>

41
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:16,249
<font color="#ffff00">My sun and stars is wounded.</font>

42
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,335
<font color="#ffff00">A scratch...</font>

43
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,045
<font color="#ffff00">...moon of my life.</font>

44
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,880
<font color="#ffff00">Where are the healers?</font>

45
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:24,966
<font color="#ffff00">This is the bite of a fly.</font>

46
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:28,553
<font color="#ffff00">I can help the great rider with his cut.</font>

47
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:33,600
<font color="#ffff00">The Khal needs no help from
slaves who lie with sheep.</font>

48
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,144
<font color="#ffff00">She is mine. Let her speak.</font>

49
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:47,656
<font color="#ffff00">Witch.</font>

50
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:03,422
<font color="#ffff00">Too many words.
A witch's words poison the ears.</font>

51
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:14,224
<font color="#ffff00">Let her clean your wound,
my sun and stars...</font>

52
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,768
<font color="#ffff00">...it makes me hurt to see you bleed.</font>
