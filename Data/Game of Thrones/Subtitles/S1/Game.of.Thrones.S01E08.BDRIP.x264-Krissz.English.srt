1
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,270
Yah!
Left high, left low.

2
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,920
Right low,
lunge right.

3
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,790
You break anything,
the Septa will have my head.

4
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,630
What is--

5
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:41,470
Your sister knew perfectly
well we were to leave today.

6
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,680
- How she could forget--
- She didn't forget.

7
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,410
She's with her dancing master.
She's with him every morning.

8
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,980
She always comes back with scrapes
and bruises. She's so clumsy.

9
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,920
Hush!

10
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:53,150
Go back to your room.

11
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,490
Bar the doors

12
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,730
and do not open them for anyone
you do not know.

13
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,430
- What is it? What's happening?
- Do as I told you.

14
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,260
Run!

15
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,670
<i>This way!</i>

16
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,350
Left, right.
Rah!

17
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,080
Now you are dead.

18
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,090
You said right,

19
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,990
but you went left.

20
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,220
And now you are
a dead girl.

21
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,860
Only 'cause you lied.

22
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:35,530
My tongue lied.
My eyes

23
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,760
shouted the truth.
You were not seeing.

24
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,300
I was so.
I watched, but you--

25
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:44,800
watching is not seeing,
dead girl.

26
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:50,510
The seeing,
the true seeing,

27
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,980
that is the heart
of swordplay.

28
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:59,990
Arya Stark,
come with us.

29
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,760
Your father wants
to see you.

30
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,160
And why is it

31
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,630
that Lord Eddard is
sending Lannister men

32
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,870
in place of his own?
I am wondering.

33
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,970
Mind your place,
dancing master.

34
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,540
<i>This is no
concern of yours.</i>

35
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,410
My father wouldn't
send you.

36
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,650
And I don't have to go
with you if I don't want.

37
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,010
Take her.

38
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:30,020
Are you men or snakes, that you
would threaten a child?

39
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,190
Get out of my way,
little man.

40
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,690
<i>I am Syrio Forel...</i>

41
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,730
Foreign bastard.

42
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:44,170
...And you will be speaking
to me with more respect.

43
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,800
Kill the Braavosi.
Bring the girl.

44
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,070
Arya child, we are done
with dancing for the day.

45
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,740
Run to your father.

46
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,970
Bloody oafs.

47
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,870
Be gone now, Arya.

48
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,470
Come with me.
Run.

49
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:26,110
The first sword of Braavos
does not run.

50
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,160
What do we say

51
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,130
to the God of death?

52
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,030
Not today.

53
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,000
Go.

54
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,660
Not today.
Not today.

55
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,000
Stay away from me.

56
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,700
I'll tell my father.

57
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,710
I'll-- I'll tell
the Queen.

58
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,440
Who do you think sent me?

59
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,820
Needle.

60
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,100
There she is.

61
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,400
- What do you want?
- I want you, wolf girl.

62
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,130
- Come here.
- Leave me be.

63
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:00,240
My father's a lord.
He'll reward you.

64
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,840
<i>She'll reward me--
the Queen!</i>

65
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:04,040
Stay away!

66
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,770
Lord Stark,
you must be thirsty.

67
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,380
Varys.

68
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,480
I promise you
it isn't poisoned.

69
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:48,450
Why is it no one ever
trusts the eunuch?

70
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,760
Not so much, My Lord.

71
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,830
I would save the rest,
if I were you.

72
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:04,740
Hide it. Men have been known to die
of thirst in these cells.

73
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:09,110
What about
my daughters?

74
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,680
The younger one seems
to have escaped the castle.

75
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,910
Even my little birds
cannot find her.

76
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:17,480
- And Sansa?
- Still engaged to Joffrey.

77
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,090
Cersei will keep her close. The rest
of your household though--

78
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,290
all dead,
it grieves me to say.

79
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,590
I do so hate
the sight of blood.

80
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,960
You watched my men being
slaughtered and did nothing.

81
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,300
And would again, My Lord.

82
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:36,740
I was unarmed, unarmored and
surrounded by Lannister swords.

83
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:39,110
When you look at me
do you see a hero?

84
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:47,410
What madness led you
to tell the Queen

85
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:50,250
you had learned the truth
about Joffrey's birth?

86
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,590
The madness of mercy.

87
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:59,030
That she might
save her children.

88
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,890
<i>Ah, the children.</i>

89
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:03,800
It is always
the innocents who suffer.

90
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:06,730
It wasn't the wine that killed Robert,
nor the boar.

91
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:10,240
The wine slowed him down
and the boar ripped him open,

92
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:13,510
but it was your mercy
that killed the King.

93
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,450
I trust you know you are
a dead man, Lord Eddard?

94
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,750
The Queen
can't kill me.

95
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:30,250
Cat holds her brother.

96
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:32,990
The wrong brother
sadly.

97
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,760
And lost to her.

98
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:37,730
Your wife has let the Imp
slip through her fingers.

99
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:44,000
If that's true,

100
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,570
then slit my throat
and be done with it.

101
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:50,180
Not today, My Lord.

102
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:56,050
Tell me something, Varys.

103
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,590
Who do you truly serve?

104
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,490
The Realm, My Lord.

105
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,790
Someone must.

106
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:26,510
It's Othor,
without a doubt.

107
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,450
The other one is
Jafer Flowers, My Lord,

108
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,250
<i>less the hand
the wolf tore off.</i>

109
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:35,290
Any sign of Benjen
or the rest of his party?

110
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,190
Just these two,
My Lord.

111
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,230
Been dead awhile,
I'd say.

112
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,000
- Mmm.
- The smell.

113
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,000
What smell?

114
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,070
There is none.

115
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:54,840
If they'd be dead for a long time,
wouldn't there be rot?

116
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,580
We should burn them.

117
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:00,650
Snow's not wrong, My Lord.
Fire will do for them.

118
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,850
The Wildling way.

119
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:05,620
I want Maester Aemon
to examine them first.

120
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,820
You may be
a coward, Tarly,

121
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,990
<i>but you're not stupid.</i>

122
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:15,060
- Get them inside.
- You heard him.

123
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,570
Lord Commander,

124
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,100
Maester Aemon awaits you
in his chambers--

125
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,970
a raven
from King's Landing.

126
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:26,880
Come on,
move 'em out.

127
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:41,450
Bring me a horn
of ale, Snow,

128
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:44,420
<i>and pour one
for yourself.</i>

129
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:56,800
The King is dead.

130
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:11,450
Is there any word
of my father?

131
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,720
Sit.

132
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,760
Lord Stark has been

133
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:23,390
charged with treason.

134
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:25,830
They say he conspired
with Robert's brothers

135
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,600
to deny the throne
to Prince Joffrey.

136
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:44,580
<i>I hope you're not thinking
of doing anything stupid.</i>

137
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:48,050
Your duty lies here now.

138
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:51,160
My sisters were
in King's Landing too.

139
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,600
I'm sure they'll be

140
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,430
treated gently.

141
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:03,700
Your father has proved to be
an awful traitor, dear.

142
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:07,210
King Robert's body
was still warm

143
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,510
when Lord Eddard began plotting
to steal Joffrey's rightful throne.

144
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,910
He wouldn't do that.

145
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:16,820
He knows how much I love Joffrey.
He wouldn't.

146
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:19,950
Please, Your Grace,
there's been a mistake.

147
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:23,630
Send for my father. He'll tell you--
the King was his friend.

148
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,730
Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of
any wrong. We know that.

149
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,260
<i>Yet you are the daughter
of a traitor.</i>

150
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,470
How can I allow you
to marry my son?

151
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,670
<i>A child born
of a traitor's seed</i>

152
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,040
is no fit consort
for our King.

153
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:40,710
<i>She is a sweet thing now,
Your Grace,</i>

154
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,210
but in 10 years who knows

155
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,210
what treasons
she may hatch?

156
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:48,310
No, I'm not. I'll be a good wife
to him, you'll see.

157
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:52,920
I'll be a Queen just like you,
I promise. I won't hatch anything.

158
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,920
The girl is innocent,
Your Grace.

159
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,760
She should be given a chance
to prove her loyalty.

160
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:09,970
Little dove, you must
write to Lady Catelyn

161
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,340
and your brother,
the eldest, what's his name?

162
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:14,110
Robb.

163
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,910
Word of your father's arrest
will reach him soon, no doubt.

164
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,350
Best it comes from you.

165
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,750
If you would help
your father,

166
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,220
urge your brother
to keep the King's peace.

167
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:28,160
Tell him to come to King's Landing
and swear his fealty to Joffrey.

168
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:37,800
If-- if I could see my father,
talk to him about--

169
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,770
You disappoint me, child.

170
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,110
We have told you
of your father's treason.

171
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,310
Why would you want
to speak to a traitor?

172
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,610
I only meant that--

173
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,650
what will happen to him?

174
00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:00,050
- That depends.
- On-- on what?

175
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:01,950
On your brother.

176
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:07,330
And on you.

177
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:17,840
Treason?

178
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:20,010
Sansa wrote this?

179
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,410
It is your sister's hand,
but the Queen's words.

180
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,550
You are summoned to King's Landing
to swear fealty to the new King.

181
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:29,680
Joffrey puts my father in chains,
now he wants his ass kissed?

182
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,220
This is a royal
command, My Lord.

183
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:36,720
- If you should refuse to obey--
- I won't refuse.

184
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,530
His Grace summons me
to King's Landing,

185
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,000
I'll go to King's Landing.

186
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:44,760
But not alone.

187
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,600
Call the banners.

188
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,970
All of them, My Lord?

189
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,880
They've all sworn to defend
my father, have they not?

190
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,100
They have.

191
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:58,280
Now we see what
their words are worth.

192
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,550
Yeah.

193
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,190
Are you afraid?

194
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,730
I must be.

195
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,930
Good.

196
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:21,000
Why is that good?

197
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,340
It means
you're not stupid.

198
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:48,630
You've had this
since dawn?

199
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,230
He sent it to me,
not you.

200
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,700
I've only shown it
to you as a courtesy.

201
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,600
A courtesy?!

202
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,640
My husband has been
taken prisoner.

203
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,310
My son intends
to declare war.

204
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,210
A war?

205
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,640
Your son against
the Lannisters?

206
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:09,050
You should go to him.
Teach him patience.

207
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:12,250
Ned rots in a dungeon
and you speak of patience?

208
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:14,990
He is your brother by law!

209
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,890
Does family mean
nothing to you?

210
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:20,790
Family means
everything to me.

211
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:23,260
And I will not
risk Robin's life

212
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,770
to get caught up in another
of your husband's wars.

213
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,700
- I'm hungry.
- Hush now, darling.

214
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,940
You just ate.

215
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:33,810
You will not support us then?
Do I understand you correctly?

216
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,680
- But I'm hungry!
- Soon, love, soon.

217
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:42,020
You're always
welcome here, sister.

218
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:45,050
But if you're asking me to send men
from the Vale to fight--

219
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,290
That is what I ask.

220
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,130
Go on, sweet.
Time for your bath.

221
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,760
I'll feed you after.

222
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:02,440
If you fear for the safety
of your son--

223
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:05,140
Of course I fear
for the safety of my son!

224
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:07,670
Are you an idiot?

225
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:10,110
They killed my husband.

226
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,580
<i>You say they shoved
your boy from a window.</i>

227
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:15,150
These people
will do anything.

228
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,250
And that is why
we have to stop them.

229
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:23,820
The knights of the Vale
will stay in the Vale

230
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:27,590
where they belong,
to protect their Lord.

231
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:44,410
Will you shut up?

232
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,550
There's hill tribes
all around here.

233
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,050
If I'm going to die,

234
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:53,420
it may as well be
with a song in my heart.

235
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,690
I should just take your food
and leave you here.

236
00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:00,000
Eh? What would
you do then?

237
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:02,870
Starve, most likely.

238
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,730
You don't think
I'd do it, do you?

239
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,270
What do you want, Bronn?
Gold? Women?

240
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:12,210
Golden women?

241
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,440
Stick with me
and you'll have them all,

242
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,310
for as long as I'm around
and not for a moment longer.

243
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:20,620
But you knew that.

244
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:24,220
That is why you so valiantly took
up arms to defend my honor.

245
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:28,420
Fair enough.

246
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,990
But don't go looking
for me to bend the knee

247
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:33,600
and "My Lord" you
every time you take a shit.

248
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,900
I'm not your toady
and I'm not your friend.

249
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,140
Though I would treasure
your friendship,

250
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,770
I'm mainly interested
in your facility with murder.

251
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:46,210
And if the day ever comes when
you're tempted to sell me out,

252
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,980
remember this:

253
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:50,880
Whatever their price,
I'll beat it.

254
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,020
I like living.

255
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:01,460
<i>Tyrion.</i>

256
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,300
Tyrion.

257
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,340
Tyrion.

258
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,730
Come, share our fire.

259
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,530
Help yourselves
to our goat.

260
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:46,800
When you meet your Gods,
you tell them

261
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,770
Shagga Son of Dolf

262
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:52,180
of the Stone Crows
sent you.

263
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:55,610
I am Tyrion son of Tywin
of Clan Lannister.

264
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:58,680
How would you like to die,
Tyrion son of Tywin?

265
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:02,850
In my own bed,
at the age of 80

266
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:05,760
with a bellyful of wine and
a girl's mouth around my cock.

267
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,170
Take the half man.

268
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,970
He can dance for the children.
Kill the other one.

269
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,100
No no no no no!

270
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:22,210
My-- my House is rich
and powerful.

271
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,910
If you see us
through these mountains,

272
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,910
my father will
shower you with gold.

273
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,980
We have no use
for a half man's promises.

274
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:33,590
Half a man maybe, but at least I have
the courage to face my enemies.

275
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,220
What do the Stone Crows do?

276
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,490
Hide behind rocks
and shiver

277
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,490
when the knights
of the Vale ride by?

278
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:43,160
Are those the best weapons
you could steal?

279
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,400
Good enough
for killing sheep,

280
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,170
if the sheep
don't fight back.

281
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,400
Lannister smiths
shit better steel.

282
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,480
You think you can win us over
with your trinkets?

283
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,760
That trinket is worth more than
everything your tribe owns.

284
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:19,030
But if you help us,
Shagga Son of Dolf,

285
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:21,740
I will not give you trinkets.

286
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:24,240
I will give you this.

287
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,740
What is "this"?

288
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:30,450
The Vale of Arryn.

289
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,780
The Lords of the Vale have always
spat upon the hill tribes.

290
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:38,020
The Lords of the Vale
want me dead.

291
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,820
I believe it is time
for new Lords of the Vale.

292
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:52,570
<i>Ser Alliser:
Now there's a rare sight--</i>

293
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,100
not only a bastard,
but a traitor's bastard.

294
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:09,850
- Jon, no!
- Jon, stop, put it down!

295
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,190
Blood will always tell.

296
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:18,360
You'll hang
for this, bastard.

297
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:40,880
I told you not to do
anything stupid.

298
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:44,550
You're confined
to quarters. Go.

299
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:11,240
Ghost, what's wrong?

300
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,480
Is something out there?

301
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,620
Commander?

302
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:54,660
Stay.

303
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:08,200
Hello?

304
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,150
Who's there?

305
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,890
Lord Commander?

306
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:56,220
<i>Snow?</i>

307
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,860
Commander!

308
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,770
Move move!

309
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,860
What did they do?

310
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,310
I thought the Dothraki
didn't believe in money.

311
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:58,250
Gold to hire ships,
Princess,

312
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,120
ships to sail
to Westeros.

313
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,370
Jorah, make them stop.

314
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:21,640
- Khaleesi?
- You heard me.

315
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:25,180
These men have shed blood for their Khal.
Now they claim their rewards.

316
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:38,390
Princess, you have
a gentle heart,

317
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:40,430
<i>but this is how
it's always been.</i>

318
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:43,430
I do not have
a gentle heart, Ser.

319
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,340
<i>Kash qoy qoyi thira disse.
Me qorasokh anni!</i>

320
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:02,510
<i>- Come.
- Man: Anha afichak mae m'arakhoon!</i>

321
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,620
What do you want
done with them?

322
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:12,220
Bring her to me.
And those women there.

323
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:16,530
You cannot claim
them all, Princess.

324
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,600
I can,

325
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:21,330
and I will.

326
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:23,330
Me Fati!

327
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:26,840

<i>ahhazaan

331
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:03,770
<i>Ohos.</i>

332
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,940
<i>Os.</i>

333
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:36,690
Thank you,
silver lady.

334
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,390
Who are you?

335
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:44,360
I am named Mirri Maz Duur.
I was the Godswife of this Temple.

336
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:48,770
My mother was Godswife
here before me.

337
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,240
She taught me how to make
healing smokes and ointments.

338
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:54,270
<i>All men are of one flock,
so my people believe.</i>

339
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:56,410
The Great Shepherd sent me
to Earth to heal his--

340
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:04,050
lamb or lion,

341
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:06,760
his wound must be
washed and sewn

342
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:09,060
<i>or it will fester.</i>

343
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:40,950
For 30 years
I've been making corpses

344
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:42,820
out of men, boy.

345
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,590
I'm the man you want
leading the Vanguard.

346
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,130
Galbart Glover
will lead the Van.

347
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,830
The bloody Wall will melt

348
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:54,930
before an Umber marches
behind a Glover.

349
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:58,000
<i>I will lead the Van</i>

350
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,340
or I will take my men

351
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:02,470
and march them home.

352
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:10,080
You are welcome
to do so, Lord Umber.

353
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,180
And when I am done
with the Lannisters

354
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,520
I will march back North,

355
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:17,020
root you out of your Keep

356
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:19,730
and hang you
for an oathbreaker.

357
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,760
Oathbreaker, is it?!

358
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:25,900
I'll not sit here
and swallow insults

359
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:28,470
from a boy so green
he pisses grass.

360
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:44,950
My Lord father taught me
it was death to bare steel

361
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,050
<i>against your Liege Lord.</i>

362
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:51,390
But doubtless the Greatjon only meant
to cut my meat for me.

363
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:55,860
Your meat...

364
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,670
is bloody tough.

365
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:37,270
- What is it? What's happened?
- Shh, it's all right.

366
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:45,320
- Where are you going?
- South. For father.

367
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,050
But it's the middle
of the night.

368
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:49,220
The Lannisters have
spies everywhere.

369
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:51,820
I don't want them
to know we're coming.

370
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:54,560
They have
more men than we do.

371
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:56,790
Aye, they do.

372
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:58,900
Can't I come with you?

373
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,430
I can ride now.
You've seen me riding.

374
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:03,570
And I won't get
in the way, I--

375
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,140
There must always be
a Stark at Winterfell.

376
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,310
Until I return
that will be you.

377
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:14,040
You are not to leave the castle walls
while we are gone. Do you understand?

378
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:20,050
Listen to Maester Luwin.
Look after your little brother.

379
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:22,220
I will.

380
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,320
I'll send letters
whenever I can,

381
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,590
but if you don't
hear from me,

382
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:28,530
don't be scared.

383
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,840
Until I return.

384
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:59,130
How long have you been
hiding out there?

385
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,630
Robb will be looking for you
to say goodbye.

386
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:05,900
They've all gone away.

387
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:08,870
They'll be back soon.
Robb will free father

388
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:11,110
and they'll come back
with mother.

389
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:15,280
No, they won't.

390
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:22,050
<i>Please watch
over Robb.</i>

391
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:24,550
And watch over all the
other men from Winterfell.

392
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:27,760
And Theon too,
I suppose.

393
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:36,230
You hear them, boy?

394
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:38,870
The Old Gods are
answering you.

395
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,800
What are you
doing here?

396
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,710
They're my Gods too.

397
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:48,810
Beyond the Wall,
they're the only Gods.

398
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:52,480
Even slaves
are allowed to pray.

399
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,890
You're not a slave.

400
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,920
Well, your friend did
put a knife to my throat.

401
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,660
I'm not complaining,
Little Lord,

402
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,430
just telling truths.

403
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:10,530
What did you mean
about hearing the Gods?

404
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:12,900
You asked them,

405
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,570
they're answering you.

406
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:17,580
Shh.

407
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,280
Open your ears.

408
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,950
It's only the wind.

409
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:29,990
Who do you think
sends the wind

410
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,990
if not the Gods?

411
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,730
They see you, boy.

412
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,160
<i>They hear you.</i>

413
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,630
Your brother will get no help
from them where he's going.

414
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:43,470
The Old Gods have
no power in the South.

415
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:47,170
The Weirwoods there were
all cut down a long time ago.

416
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:49,980
How can they watch
when they have no eyes?

417
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:56,880
Well, there's a big man.

418
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,090
He has giants' blood
in him or I'm the Queen.

419
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,490
Go back and find
your clothes, Hodor.

420
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,360
<i>Go dress.</i>

421
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:05,920
Hodor.

422
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,260
Are there really giants
beyond the Wall?

423
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:15,600
Giants
and worse than giants.

424
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:18,600
I tried telling
your brother,

425
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,440
he's marching
the wrong way.

426
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:23,980
All these swords,
they should be going North, boy.

427
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,180
North, not south!

428
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,320
The cold winds are rising.

429
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,640
They were touched
by White Walkers.

430
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:53,140
That's why
they came back.

431
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:56,040
That's why their eyes
turned blue.

432
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:59,210
Only fire will
stop them.

433
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:02,920
How do you know that?

434
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:04,690
I read about it
in a book--

435
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,790
a very old book
in Maester Aemon's library.

436
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:12,460
What else
did the book say?

437
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,400
The White Walkers

438
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:17,200
sleep beneath the ice
for thousands of years.

439
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,770
And when they wake up--

440
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:24,610
And when they
wake up, what?

441
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:30,080
I hope The Wall
is high enough.

442
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:04,910
Summer snows, My Lady.

443
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:07,980
Robb's brought
the North with him.

444
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:16,060
The River Lords
are falling back

445
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:17,920
with Jaime Lannister
at their heels.

446
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:21,360
And Lord Tywin is bringing around a
second Lannister army from the South.

447
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,170
Our scouts confirm it's even larger
than the Kingslayer's.

448
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,470
One army or two,
the Kings in the North

449
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:31,310
threw back hosts
10 times as large.

450
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:36,480
Mother!

451
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,120
You look well.

452
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:47,390
Lady Catelyn, you're a welcome
sight in these troubled times.

453
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:49,890
We had not thought
to meet you here, My Lady.

454
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:53,430
I had not thought
to be here.

455
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,530
I would speak
with my son alone.

456
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,870
I know you will
forgive me, My Lords.

457
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,130
You heard her!
Move your asses!

458
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:02,500
Come on, out.

459
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:05,170
You too, Greyjoy.
Are you bloody deaf?

460
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:07,110
Have no fear, My Lady.

461
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,910
<i>We'll shove our swords
up Tywin Lannister's bunghole</i>

462
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:12,720
and then it's on to the Red Keep
to free Ned.

463
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:15,680
- You old devil, Rodrik.
- Jon.

464
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,050
You're not
wasting away, are you?

465
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:32,130
I remember the day
you came into this world

466
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:35,200
red-faced and squalling.

467
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:39,370
And now I find you
leading a host to war.

468
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:42,810
- There was no one else.
- No one?

469
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,580
Who were those men
I saw here?

470
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:48,680
- None of them are Starks.
- All of them are seasoned in battle.

471
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,750
If you think you can send me back
to Winterfell--

472
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:54,060
Oh, would that I could.

473
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:59,090
There was...

474
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:01,560
a letter.

475
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,440
From Sansa.

476
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,700
From the Queen,
you mean.

477
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:19,780
- There's no mention of Arya.
- No.

478
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:32,730
How many men
do you have?

479
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,160
18,000.

480
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,660
If I go to King's Landing
and bend my knee to Joffrey--

481
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:40,770
you would never
be allowed to leave. No.

482
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,570
Our best hope--
our only hope--

483
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,910
is that you can defeat
them in the field.

484
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,970
And if I lose?

485
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:51,540
Do you know what happened
to the Targaryen children

486
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:54,580
- when the Mad King fell?
- They were butchered in their sleep.

487
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:57,320
On the orders
of Tywin Lannister.

488
00:42:57,350 --> 00:43:00,050
And the years have
not made him kinder.

489
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,330
If you lose,

490
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:08,060
your father dies,

491
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:09,630
your sisters die,

492
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,900
<i>we die.</i>

493
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:16,500
Well, that makes it
simple then.

494
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,840
I suppose it does.

495
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:46,100
From here it might be best if
Bronn and I continue alone.

496
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:48,700
Best for Tyrion
son of Tywin.

497
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:50,740
Not best for me.

498
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:53,940
If the half man betrays us,

499
00:43:53,970 --> 00:43:57,410
Shagga Son of Dolf
will cut off his manhood--

500
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,980
and feed it
to the goats, yes.

501
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,050
All right then.

502
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:07,290
Time to meet my father.

503
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:42,420
- Tyrion.
- Uncle.

504
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:44,320
Father.

505
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:48,830
The rumors of your demise
were unfounded.

506
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:52,260
Sorry
to disappoint you.

507
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:54,830
And who are these...

508
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:57,100
<i>Companions of yours?</i>

509
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:01,610
This is Shagga
Son of Dolf,

510
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:04,010
<i>Chieftain
of the Stone Crows.</i>

511
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:08,410
<i>Timett Son of Timett,
ruler of the Burned Men.</i>

512
00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:13,180
<i>This fair maid is
Chella daughter of Cheyk,</i>

513
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:15,590
<i>leader
of the Black Ears.</i>

514
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:18,990
And here we have
Bronn son of...

515
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:21,630
You wouldn't know him.

516
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:26,200
May I present
My Lord Father,

517
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:28,870
Tywin son of Tytos
of House Lannister,

518
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:31,970
<i>Lord of Casterly Rock
and Warden of the West?</i>

519
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:36,580
Kind of you
to go to war for me.

520
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:41,550
You left us no choice.

521
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:43,650
The honor of the House
was at stake.

522
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:48,320
Your brother would never have
submitted to capture so meekly.

523
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:50,890
We have our differences,
Jaime and I.

524
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:53,090
He's braver.
I'm better looking.

525
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:55,460
He's been covering himself
in glory.

526
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:58,730
Jaime smashed the River Lords
at the Golden Tooth,

527
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:02,440
and now lays siege to Riverrun,
Catelyn Stark's homeland.

528
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:04,570
And the Starks?
Lord Eddard?

529
00:46:04,610 --> 00:46:08,680
--Is our hostage. He will lead
no armies from his dungeon cell.

530
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:10,750
How did my sweet sister
persuade the King

531
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:12,650
to imprison
his dear friend Ned?

532
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:16,650
Robert Baratheon is dead.
Joffrey rules in King's Landing.

533
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:21,630
My sister rules,
you mean.

534
00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:25,130
Stark's son has
called his banners.

535
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:28,600
- He moves south with a strong host.
- A green boy.

536
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:30,400
One taste of battle
and he'll run

537
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:33,000
back to Winterfell
wi his tail between his legs.

538
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:35,710
Maybe.

539
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:38,310
Though the boy does have
a certain belligerence.

540
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:40,850
You'd like him.

541
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,920
While we're on
the subject of war,

542
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:47,650
I made promises
to my friends here

543
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:50,050
and a Lannister
always pays his debts.

544
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:53,160
<i>We shall require
3,000 helms and shields,</i>

545
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:55,430
plus swords, pikes,

546
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:57,260
gorgets, maces--

547
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:59,860
if it please My Lord,

548
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,970
Ser Addam bids me report
that the Northmen

549
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,400
have crossed the neck.

550
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,870
The wolf rushes
into the lion's jaws.

551
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:12,140
So be it. Kevan, command the
drummers beat assembly.

552
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:16,780
And send word to Jaime that
I am moving against Robb Stark.

553
00:47:16,810 --> 00:47:18,780
At once, My Lord.

554
00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:34,700
It is said that the men of the
Mountain clans are great warriors.

555
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:36,470
Ride with me
against my enemies

556
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:39,540
and you shall have all
my son promised you and more.

557
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:41,810
Only if the half man
fights with us.

558
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:45,280
Until we hold the steel
he pledged us,

559
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:47,710
the little lion's
life is ours.

560
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:55,960
<i>The scouts report
Lord Tywin moves north.</i>

561
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:57,820
We need to get him
on broken ground,

562
00:47:57,860 --> 00:47:59,530
put his Knights
at a disadvantage.

563
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:01,660
No, we need to get
around him

564
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:04,600
and break Jaime Lannister's
siege of Riverrun.

565
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:07,470
Do that and the River Lords
will join us.

566
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,370
To do either we need to cross
the river

567
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,070
and the only crossing
is at The Twins.

568
00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:13,140
<i>Lord Frey controls
that bridge.</i>

569
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:14,740
Your father's bannerman.

570
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:18,010
"The late Lord Frey"
my father calls him.

571
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:21,550
At the Trident, he didn't appear
until the battle was done.

572
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:25,620
Some men takes their oaths
more seriously than others.

573
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:35,760
Robb's right.
We need that bridge.

574
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,900
So what's it going to be?

575
00:48:37,930 --> 00:48:41,330
Do we move against
Jaime or Lord Tywin?

576
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:47,040
Your pardon, my lords.

577
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:49,740
<i>We've captured
a Lannister scout.</i>

578
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:54,980
Don't worry, lad. He won't b
leaving this tent with his head.

579
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:57,990
Where did you find him?

580
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:00,150
In the brush above
the encampment.

581
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:02,060
<i>He looked to be counting.</i>

582
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,300
How high did you get?

583
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:18,670
20,000.
Maybe more.

584
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:21,440
You don't have
to do this yourself.

585
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:23,040
Your father
would understand--

586
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:27,110
My father unrstands mercy,
when there is room for it.

587
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:30,350
And he understands honor...

588
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,420
and courage.

589
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:39,160
Let him go.

590
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:42,530
Robb.

591
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:57,510
Tell Lord Tywin
Winter is coming for him.

592
00:49:57,540 --> 00:50:02,480
20,000 Northerners marching south
to find out if he really does shit gold.

593
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:06,050
Yes, My Lord.

594
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:07,890
Thank you, My Lord.

595
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:21,030
Are you touched, boy?!
Letting him go?

596
00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:23,100
You call me boy again.

597
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,240
Go on.

598
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:46,460
Oi.

599
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:54,200
<i>It is also the wish
of His Grace</i>

600
00:50:54,230 --> 00:50:59,540
<i>that his loyal servant
Janos Slynt,</i>

601
00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:02,670
<i>- Commander of the City Watch...
- Ser Aron.</i>

602
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:06,280
<i>...Be at once raised
to the rank of Lord...</i>

603
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:11,780
<i>- Lord Gyles.
- ...And granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal,</i>

604
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:15,650
<i>and that his sons and grandsons
shall hold this honor</i>

605
00:51:15,690 --> 00:51:20,790
<i>after him
until the end of time.</i>

606
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:27,960
In the place of the traitor
Eddard Stark,

607
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,670
<i>it is the wish of his Grace
that Tywin Lannister,</i>

608
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:36,510
<i>Lord of Casterly Rock
and Warden of the West,</i>

609
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:40,640
<i>be appointed
Hand of the King.</i>

610
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,580
Lastly,

611
00:51:42,610 --> 00:51:45,450
in these times
of treason and turmoil,

612
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:48,720
<i>it is the view
of the Council</i>

613
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:51,290
that the life and safety

614
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,990
of King Joffrey

615
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:58,260
be of paramount importance.

616
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:02,400
Ser Barristan Selmy.

617
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:12,240
Your Grace, I am
yours to command.

618
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,380
Rise, Ser Barristan.

619
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:17,350
You may remove
your helm.

620
00:52:22,290 --> 00:52:24,890
<i>You have served the Realm
long and faithfully.</i>

621
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:28,890
<i>Every man and woman in the
Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks.</i>

622
00:52:28,930 --> 00:52:32,200
But it is time to put aside
your armor and your sword.

623
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:35,130
<i>It is time to rest
and look back with pride</i>

624
00:52:35,170 --> 00:52:36,800
on your many years
of service.

625
00:52:39,010 --> 00:52:41,440
Your Grace, the Kingsguard
is a sworn brotherhood.

626
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:43,640
<i>Our vows are
taken for life.</i>

627
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:46,180
Only death relieves us
of our sacred trust.

628
00:52:46,210 --> 00:52:49,920
Whose death, Ser Barristan?
Yours or your King's?

629
00:52:49,950 --> 00:52:52,820
<i>You let my father die.</i>

630
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:55,790
You're too old
to protect anybody.

631
00:52:58,090 --> 00:53:00,830
- Your Grace--
- The Council has determined

632
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:03,300
that Ser Jaime Lannister
will take your place

633
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:05,600
<i>as Lord Commander
of the Kingsguard.</i>

634
00:53:05,630 --> 00:53:07,170
The man who
profaned his blade

635
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,400
with the blood of the King
he had sworn to defend!

636
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,370
Careful, Ser.

637
00:53:11,410 --> 00:53:13,110
We have nothing
but gratitude

638
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:15,610
for your long service,
good Ser.

639
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:18,110
You shall be given
a stout Keep beside the sea,

640
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:20,480
with servants
to look after your every need.

641
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,720
A hall to die in

642
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:25,150
<i>and men to bury me.</i>

643
00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:29,790
I am a Knight.

644
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:32,860
I shall die a Knight.

645
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,940
A naked Knight,
apparently.

646
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:55,520
Even now I could cut through
the five of you like carving a cake!

647
00:53:59,690 --> 00:54:02,220
Here, boy!

648
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:04,690
Melt it down and add it
to the others.

649
00:54:21,210 --> 00:54:23,540
If any man in this hall
has other matters

650
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:26,710
to set before His Grace,
let him speak now

651
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:29,980
or go forth and hold
his silence.

652
00:54:32,650 --> 00:54:34,790
Your Grace.

653
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:37,190
Come forward,
My Lady.

654
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,700
<i>The Lady Sansa
of House Stark.</i>

655
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:46,640
Do you have some business for
the King and the Council, Sansa?

656
00:54:46,670 --> 00:54:48,500
I do.

657
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:56,480
As it please Your Grace,
I ask mercy for my father,

658
00:54:56,510 --> 00:54:59,980
Lord Eddard Stark,
who was Hand of the King.

659
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:02,880
Treason is a noxious weed.

660
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:07,090
- It should be torn out, root--
- Let her speak.

661
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:09,830
I want to hear
what she says.

662
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:12,000
Thank you, Your Grace.

663
00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:14,630
Do you deny
your father's crime?

664
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:19,140
No, My Lords.
I know he must be punished.

665
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:21,170
All I ask is mercy.

666
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:24,080
<i>I know My Lord father
must regret what he did.</i>

667
00:55:24,110 --> 00:55:26,410
He was King Robert's friend
and he loved him.

668
00:55:26,450 --> 00:55:28,650
You all know he loved him.

669
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:32,280
He never wanted to be Hand
until the King asked him.

670
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:35,720
They must have lied to him--
Lord Renly or Lord Stannis

671
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:38,560
or somebody.
They must have lied!

672
00:55:38,590 --> 00:55:41,060
He said
I wasn't the King.

673
00:55:41,090 --> 00:55:43,160
Why did he say that?

674
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,460
He was badly hurt.

675
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:48,370
Maester Pycelle was giving
him milk of the poppy.

676
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:52,570
He wasn't himself. Otherwise h
never would have said it.

677
00:55:54,910 --> 00:55:58,780
A child's faith...
Such sweet innocence.

678
00:55:58,810 --> 00:56:02,480
<i>And yet they say
wisdom oft comes</i>

679
00:56:02,510 --> 00:56:04,350
from the mouths of babes.

680
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:08,520
Treason
is treason!

681
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:13,820
Anything else?

682
00:56:15,390 --> 00:56:18,800
If you still have any affection
in your heart for me,

683
00:56:18,830 --> 00:56:22,330
please do me
this kindness, Your Grace.

684
00:56:31,910 --> 00:56:34,180
Your sweet words
have moved me.

685
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:39,150
But your father has
to confess.

686
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:42,780
He has to confess
and say that I'm the King...

687
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:47,820
Or there'll be
no mercy for him.

688
00:56:52,290 --> 00:56:54,400
He will.
