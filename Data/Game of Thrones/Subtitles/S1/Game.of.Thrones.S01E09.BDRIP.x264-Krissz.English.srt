2
00:02:08,004 --> 00:02:09,922
You've seen better days, my lord.

3
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:13,217
Another visit?

4
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:16,971
It seems you're my last friend.

5
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:19,932
No, no, many still love you.

6
00:02:20,683 --> 00:02:25,313
Sansa came to court this morning
to plead for your life.

7
00:02:26,731 --> 00:02:29,233
On her knees begging for me. Hm!

8
00:02:29,359 --> 00:02:31,486
Did you laugh with the others?

9
00:02:31,611 --> 00:02:35,156
You do me wrong, my lord.
Your blood is the last thing I want.

10
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:37,158
I don't know what you want.

11
00:02:37,283 --> 00:02:38,910
I've given up trying to guess.

12
00:02:42,455 --> 00:02:44,540
When I was still a boy -

13
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:48,461
before they cut my balls off with a hot knife -

14
00:02:48,586 --> 00:02:52,006
I traveled with a group of actors
through the free cities.

15
00:02:53,633 --> 00:02:56,636
They taught me that
each man has a role to play.

16
00:02:56,761 --> 00:02:59,514
The same is true at court.

17
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:01,891
I am the master of whisperers.

18
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:06,396
My role is to be sly, obsequious
and without scruples.

19
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:08,481
I'm a good actor, my lord.

20
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:11,859
Huh. Can you free me from this pit?

21
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:13,986
I could.

22
00:03:14,112 --> 00:03:15,446
But will I?

23
00:03:16,114 --> 00:03:17,907
- No.

24
00:03:18,032 --> 00:03:19,992
As I said, I'm no hero.

25
00:03:20,118 --> 00:03:21,869
What do you want? Tell me.

26
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:24,831
No riddles, no stories...
Tell me, what do you want'?

27
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:28,543
Peace.

28
00:03:28,668 --> 00:03:34,716
Did you know that your son is marching south
with an army of northmen? Loyal lad.

29
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:37,176
Fighting for his father's freedom.

30
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:39,470
Robb?

31
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:41,389
He's just a boy.

32
00:03:41,514 --> 00:03:43,725
Boys have been conquerors before.

33
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:50,398
But the man giving Cersei sleepless nights
is the king's... the late king's brother.

34
00:03:50,523 --> 00:03:53,276
Lord Stannis has the best claim to the throne.

35
00:03:53,401 --> 00:03:56,571
He is a proven battle commander
and he is utterly without mercy.

36
00:03:56,696 --> 00:04:01,075
Stannis Baratheon is Robert's true heir.
The throne is his by rights.

37
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:07,915
Sansa pleaded so sweetly for your life.
It would be a shame to throw it away.

38
00:04:09,542 --> 00:04:11,544
Cersei is no fool.

39
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:14,964
She knows a tame wolf
is more use to her than a dead one.

40
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:18,634
You want me to serve the woman who
murdered my king, who butchered my men

41
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,344
who crippled my son?

42
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,388
I want you to serve the realm!

43
00:04:27,477 --> 00:04:30,688
and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir.

44
00:04:32,607 --> 00:04:35,735
Cersei knows you as a man of honor.

45
00:04:36,736 --> 00:04:40,615
If you give her the peace she needs,
and promise to carry her secret to your grave,

46
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,326
I believe she will allow you
to take the black

47
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:46,954
and live out your days on the Wall
with your brother and your bastard son.

48
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:51,000
You think my life
is some precious thing to me?

49
00:04:52,585 --> 00:04:55,838
That I would trade my honor
for a few more years of...

50
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:57,590
Of what?

51
00:05:02,512 --> 00:05:04,555
You grew up with actors.

52
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,018
You learned their craft and you learnt it well.

53
00:05:10,186 --> 00:05:12,480
But I grew up with soldiers.

54
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:16,943
I learned how to die a long time ago.

55
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,781
Pity.

56
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:24,742
Such a pity.

57
00:05:31,624 --> 00:05:33,960
What of your daughter's life, my lord?

58
00:05:34,085 --> 00:05:36,504
Is that a precious thing to you?

59
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:20,882
It's a birthday message
to his grand-niece Walda.

60
00:06:21,007 --> 00:06:24,719
- Or so Walder Frey would have you think.
-  Keep shooting them down.

61
00:06:24,844 --> 00:06:27,889
We can't risk Lord Walder sending
word of your movements to the Lannisters.

62
00:06:28,014 --> 00:06:30,975
He's Grandfather's bannerman.
We can't expect his support?

63
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,896
Expect nothing of Walder Frey
and you'll never be surprised.

64
00:06:35,021 --> 00:06:36,147
Look.

65
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:40,109
Father rots in a dungeon.

66
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:42,320
How long before they take his head?

67
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:45,448
We need to cross the Trident
and we need to do it now.

68
00:06:45,573 --> 00:06:48,034
Just march up to his gates
and tell him you're crossing.

69
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:51,078
We've got five times his numbers.
You can take the Twins if you have to.

70
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:54,582
Not in time.
Tywin Lannister marches north as we speak.

71
00:06:54,707 --> 00:06:57,376
The Freys have
held the crossing for 600 years,

72
00:06:57,501 --> 00:07:00,630
and for 600 years
they have never failed to exact their toll.

73
00:07:00,755 --> 00:07:03,007
Have my horse saddled and ready.

74
00:07:03,132 --> 00:07:06,218
Enter the Twins alone and he'll sell you
to the Lannisters as he likes.

75
00:07:06,344 --> 00:07:09,138
Or throw you in a dungeon.
Or slit your throat.

76
00:07:11,933 --> 00:07:14,894
My father would do whatever it took
to secure our crossing.

77
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:17,271
Whatever it took.

78
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:21,943
If I'm going to lead this army, I can't have
other men doing my bargaining for me.

79
00:07:22,068 --> 00:07:23,235
I agree.

80
00:07:25,196 --> 00:07:26,447
- I'll go.
-  You can't!

81
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:30,868
I have known Lord Walder since I was a girl.
He would never harm me.

82
00:07:30,993 --> 00:07:33,412
Unless there was a profit in it.

83
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:41,003
What do you want?

84
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:44,674
It is a great pleasure to see you again
after so many years, my lord.

85
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:46,509
Oh, spare me.

86
00:07:46,634 --> 00:07:50,721
Your boy's too proud
to come before me himself.

87
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:52,848
What am I supposed to do with you?

88
00:07:52,974 --> 00:07:55,977
Father, you forget yourself.
Lady Stark is here...

89
00:07:56,102 --> 00:08:02,191
Who asked you? You're not Lord Frey yet,
not until I die. Do I look dead to you'?

90
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:06,070
- Father, please...
- I need lessons in courtesy from you, bastard'?

91
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:11,575
Your mother would still be a milkmaid
if I hadn't squirted you into her belly.

92
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:18,165
All right, you come forward.

93
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:32,304
There.
Now that I've observed the courtesies,

94
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:35,808
perhaps my sons will do me the honor
of shutting their mouths.

95
00:08:41,272 --> 00:08:43,190
Is there somewhere we can talk?

96
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:45,317
We're talking right now.

97
00:08:49,405 --> 00:08:50,865
Fine.

98
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,534
Out! All of you!

99
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:05,296
- Oh!
- You too.

100
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:14,805
You see that?

101
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,974
Fifteen, she is.

102
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:18,893
A little flower.

103
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:23,439
And her honey's all mine.

104
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:28,194
I'm sure she will give you many sons.

105
00:09:28,903 --> 00:09:31,947
Huh.
Your father didn't come to the wedding.

106
00:09:32,073 --> 00:09:33,991
He is quite ill, my lord.

107
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:37,244
Huh. Didn't come to the last one, either.

108
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:39,538
Or the one before that.

109
00:09:41,207 --> 00:09:43,167
Your family has always pissed on me.

110
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:46,170
- My lord, I...
- Don't deny it. You know it's true.

111
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:50,716
The fine Lord Tully would never marry
any of his children to mine.

112
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:53,761
- I'm sure there were reasons...
- I didn't need reasons.

113
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:58,557
I needed to get rid of sons and daughters.
You see how they pile up?

114
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:04,105
Why are you here?

115
00:10:06,357 --> 00:10:07,775
To ask you...

116
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,152
to open your gates, my lord...

117
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:14,782
so my son and his bannermen
may cross the Trident and be on their way.

118
00:10:14,907 --> 00:10:17,952
- Why should I let him?
- If you could climb your own battlements,

119
00:10:18,077 --> 00:10:21,580
you would see that he has
20,000 men outside your walls.

120
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:25,084
They'll be 20,000 corpses
when Twin Lannister gets here.

121
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:27,545
Don't try and frighten me, Lady Stark.

122
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:30,047
Your husband's in a cell
beneath the Red Keep

123
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:33,008
and your son's got no fur
to keep his balls warm.

124
00:10:33,134 --> 00:10:35,469
You swore an oath to my father.

125
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:38,639
Oh, yes, I said some words.

126
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:41,934
And I swore oaths to the crown too,
if I remember right.

127
00:10:42,852 --> 00:10:44,311
Joffrey's king now,

128
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:49,066
which makes your boy and his corpses-to-be
nothing but rebels, it seems to me.

129
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:54,989
If I had the sense the gods gave a fish,
I'd hand you both over to the Lannisters.

130
00:10:55,114 --> 00:10:59,994
- Why don't you?
- Stark, Tully, Lannister, Baratheon.

131
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:06,208
Give me one good reason why I should
waste a single thought on any of you?

132
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:08,711
And...engage!

133
00:11:11,005 --> 00:11:14,008
When does Aemon think
you'll be able to use that hand?

134
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:16,302
- Soon, he says.
- Good.

135
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:20,181
You'll be ready for this, then.

136
00:11:20,306 --> 00:11:24,977
I thought a wolf was more
appropriate for you than a bear...

137
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:29,565
so I had a new pommel made.
It's called Longclaw.

138
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:33,319
Works as well for a wolf as a bear, I think.

139
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:45,998
This is Valyrian steel.

140
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:51,712
It was my father's sword,
his father before him.

141
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:55,216
The Mormonts have carried it
for five centuries.

142
00:11:55,341 --> 00:11:57,343
It was meant for my son Jorah.

143
00:11:58,177 --> 00:12:03,182
He brought dishonor to our House,
but he had the grace to leave the sword

144
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:05,559
before he fled from Westeros.

145
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:09,730
- My lord, you honor me, but I can't...
- Oh, you can.

146
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,565
And you will.

147
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:15,569
I wouldn't be standing here
if it wasn't for you and your beast.

148
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:18,364
A bloody dead man tried to kill me.

149
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:24,078
So you'll take it.
I'll hear no more about it.

150
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,914
- Is that understood?
- Yes, my lord.

151
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:28,624
Right.

152
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:34,630
Now, don't think this means I approve
of this nonsense with you and Alliser Thorne.

153
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:38,217
That's a man's sword.
It'll take a man to wield it.

154
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,595
I'll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight.

155
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,099
No, you won't.
I sent him to King's Landing yesterday.

156
00:12:45,224 --> 00:12:49,228
The hand that your wolf tore off
that thing's wrist...

157
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:52,648
I've, uh, ordered Thorne
to lay it at the feet of this...

158
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:54,608
boy king.

159
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:57,569
That should get young Joffrey's attention.

160
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:03,784
And it, uh, puts a thousand leagues
between you and Thorne.

161
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:06,453
Now go and put your sword somewhere safe...

162
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:08,956
and bring me my supper.

163
00:13:09,081 --> 00:13:10,624
Yes, my lord.

164
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:24,513
- Well done.
- Well done.

165
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:28,267
You earned that, Snow.

166
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:34,273
Well done.

167
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:40,195
Go on, let's have a look.

168
00:13:40,321 --> 00:13:42,614
- At what?
-  The sword! Show us the sword.

169
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:45,659
Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword!

170
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:49,038
Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword!

171
00:13:54,293 --> 00:13:55,961
- Let's have a look.
- Piss off.

172
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:01,967
Come on,
I want to have a look at it in the light.

173
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,847
Give it here!

174
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:08,849
What is it?

175
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:10,976
- I...
- Look at its eyes.

176
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:12,603
- Give it.
- I can't.

177
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:15,189
You can't what?

178
00:14:15,314 --> 00:14:16,482
I.-

179
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:20,778
I'm really not supposed to say.

180
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:23,530
And yet you really want to say.

181
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:25,616
You want to say that...?

182
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:31,705
There was a raven.

183
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,707
I read the message to Maester Aemon.

184
00:14:36,168 --> 00:14:38,003
It's your brother Robb.

185
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:39,880
What?

186
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:41,507
What about him?

187
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:44,468
He's heading south.

188
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:46,387
To war.

189
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:52,434
All his bannermen have rallied to his side.
They'll keep him safe.

190
00:14:53,811 --> 00:14:55,896
I should be there.

191
00:14:57,856 --> 00:14:59,525
I should be with him.

192
00:15:14,415 --> 00:15:16,667
If we do that, they'll never get back across.

193
00:15:18,544 --> 00:15:20,254
Well?

194
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:22,047
What did he say?

195
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:25,676
Lord Walder has granted your crossing.

196
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:30,722
- His men are yours, as well.
-  Huh.

197
00:15:30,848 --> 00:15:34,601
Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the
crossing against any who would pursue you.

198
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:36,103
What does he want in return?

199
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:40,441
You will be taking on his son Olyvar
as your personal squire.

200
00:15:40,566 --> 00:15:43,402
- He expects a knighthood in good time.
- Fine, fine.

201
00:15:45,571 --> 00:15:47,072
And?

202
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:50,242
And Arya...

203
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:54,163
will marry his son Waldron
when they both come of age.

204
00:15:54,288 --> 00:15:56,915
- She won't be happy about that.
- Hm.

205
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:02,171
And?

206
00:16:03,172 --> 00:16:04,339
And...

207
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,593
when the fighting is done...

208
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:12,097
you will marry one of his daughters.

209
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:15,184
Whichever you prefer.

210
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:18,645
He has a number
he thinks will be...suitable.

211
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,647
I see.

212
00:16:22,441 --> 00:16:24,818
Did you get a look at his daughters'?

213
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:26,361
I did.

214
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:28,780
And?

215
00:16:30,282 --> 00:16:31,700
One was...

216
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:39,416
Do you consent?

217
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:43,128
- Can I refuse?
- Not if you want to cross.

218
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:48,300
Then I consent.

219
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:36,306
Sam said you wanted to see me?

220
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:38,767
I did indeed.

221
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:41,853
Perhaps you would
be kind enough to assist me.

222
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:50,571
Tell me, did you ever wonder
why the men of the Night's Watch

223
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:53,740
take no wives and father no children?

224
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:55,534
No.

225
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:57,369
So they will not love.

226
00:17:58,203 --> 00:18:01,873
Love is the death of duty.

227
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:05,794
If the day should ever come when
your lord father was forced to choose...

228
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,255
between honor on the one hand...

229
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,799
and those he loves on the other,

230
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:12,259
what would he do?

231
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:17,431
He... He would do whatever was right.
No matter what.

232
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:21,685
Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,000.

233
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:24,396
Most of us are not so strong.

234
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:27,107
What is honor...

235
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:29,901
compared to a woman's love'?

236
00:18:30,027 --> 00:18:32,446
And what is duty...

237
00:18:32,571 --> 00:18:36,074
against the feel
of a newborn son in your arms?

238
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:38,577
Or a brother's smile?

239
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:44,458
Sam told you.

240
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,585
We're all human.

241
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,880
Oh, we all do our duty
when there's no cost to it.

242
00:18:50,005 --> 00:18:52,799
Honor comes easy then.

243
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:54,384
Yet...

244
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:56,428
sooner or later...

245
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:58,472
in every man's life...

246
00:18:58,597 --> 00:19:01,600
there comes a day when it is not easy.

247
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,770
A day when he must choose.

248
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:08,649
And this is my day'?

249
00:19:08,774 --> 00:19:10,817
Is that what you're saying?

250
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:14,029
Oh, it hurts, boy. Oh, yes.

251
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:16,990
- I know.
- You do not know.

252
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:20,911
No one knows.

253
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:24,665
I may be a bastard,

254
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:27,250
but he is my father and Robb is my brother.

255
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:35,842
The gods were cruel
when they saw fit to test my vows.

256
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:37,969
They waited till I was old.

257
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:43,517
What could I do when the ravens
brought the news from the South...

258
00:19:43,642 --> 00:19:46,019
the ruin of my House,
the death of my family?

259
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:48,021
I was helpless...

260
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:51,400
blind, frail.

261
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:55,153
But...

262
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:58,782
when I heard they had
killed my brother's son...

263
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:00,992
and his poor son...

264
00:20:01,118 --> 00:20:02,494
and the children!

265
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:04,913
Even the little children.

266
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:08,667
Who are you?

267
00:20:10,836 --> 00:20:14,589
My father was Maekar,

268
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:16,800
the first of his name.

269
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:21,138
My brother Aegon reigned after him...

270
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:24,141
when I had refused the throne.

271
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:27,686
And he was followed by his son Aerys...

272
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:30,731
whom they called the Mad King.

273
00:20:30,856 --> 00:20:32,482
You're Aemon Targaryen.

274
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:37,237
I'm a maester of the Citadel,

275
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:41,533
bound in service to Castle Black
and the Night's Watch.

276
00:20:44,536 --> 00:20:48,665
I will not tell you...to stay or go.

277
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:52,252
You must make that choice yourself...

278
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:55,630
and live with it for the rest of your days.

279
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:00,677
As I have.

280
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:22,115
My lord...

281
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:24,743
My sun and stars...

282
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:28,914
Drogo.

283
00:21:40,217 --> 00:21:41,968
My horse...

284
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:43,929
Blood of my blood...

285
00:21:44,054 --> 00:21:47,933
No, I must ride.

286
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:50,435
He fell from his horse.

287
00:21:51,228 --> 00:21:55,148
A Khal who cannot ride is no Khal.

288
00:21:55,273 --> 00:21:58,360
He's tired, that's all. He needs to rest.

289
00:21:58,485 --> 00:22:02,697
We've ridden far enough today.
We'll camp here.

290
00:22:02,823 --> 00:22:05,033
This is no place to camp.

291
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:08,328
A woman does not give us orders.
Not even a Khaleesi.

292
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:12,415
We'll camp here.
Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it.

293
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:15,085
You do not command me, Khaleesi.

294
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:18,338
Find Mirri Maz Duur.
Bring her to me.

295
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:21,049
The witch?
I'll bring you her head, Khaleesi.

296
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:26,930
Bring her to me unharmed
or Khal Drogo will hear why you denied me.

297
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,980
Hyah! Hyah!

298
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:59,421
Our scouts tell us the Stark host
has moved south from the Twins

299
00:22:59,546 --> 00:23:01,882
with Lord Frey's levies in tow.

300
00:23:02,007 --> 00:23:04,509
They're a day's march north.

301
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:07,012
The boy may lack experience and sense,

302
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:09,556
but he does have a certain mindless...

303
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:13,268
- provincial courage.
- Ah.

304
00:23:16,688 --> 00:23:18,899
Oh, do continue.
Didn't mean to interrupt.

305
00:23:19,024 --> 00:23:21,401
I do hope your savages
are going to be of some use,

306
00:23:21,526 --> 00:23:23,570
otherwise we've wasted good steel on them.

307
00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:27,073
The great hairy one insisted
he must have two battleaxes.

308
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:29,618
Heavy black steel, double-sided.

309
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:31,578
Shagga likes axes.

310
00:23:31,703 --> 00:23:36,416
When the battle commences,
you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard.

311
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:38,084
- The vanguard?
- Mm-hm.

312
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:40,795
Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?

313
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:43,298
They do seem rather ferocious.

314
00:23:45,884 --> 00:23:47,594
Ferocious?

315
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:52,432
Last night...a Moon Brother
stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage.

316
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:56,269
Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother
and opened his throat.

317
00:23:56,394 --> 00:23:59,022
Bronn managed to keep Shagga
from chopping off the dead man's cock,

318
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:03,276
which was fortunate, but even still,
Ulf is demanding blood money,

319
00:24:03,401 --> 00:24:05,987
which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay.

320
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:09,240
When soldiers lack discipline,
the fault lies with their commander.

321
00:24:09,366 --> 00:24:12,827
Surely there are ways to have me killed that
would be less detrimental to the war effort.

322
00:24:12,953 --> 00:24:15,330
There'll be no more discussion on the matter.

323
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:22,921
It appears I'm not hungry after all.

324
00:24:23,046 --> 00:24:24,631
Excuse me, my lords.

325
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:40,814
Where did you find one so pretty
at this hour?

326
00:24:40,939 --> 00:24:43,108
- I took her.
- Took her?

327
00:24:43,775 --> 00:24:46,277
- From whom?
- From, uh...

328
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:48,196
Ser... What's his name?

329
00:24:49,572 --> 00:24:54,160
- I don't know. Ginger cunt, three tents down.
- And he didn't have anything to say about it?

330
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:57,539
He said something.

331
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:05,380
Well, the odds of me living long enough for him
to retaliate have just dropped drastically.

332
00:25:05,505 --> 00:25:07,757
We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow.

333
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:12,554
Oh, well.

334
00:25:13,972 --> 00:25:17,934
I, uh...
think I'll go and find myself one.

335
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,940
Who are you?

336
00:25:24,065 --> 00:25:26,443
Who would you like me to be?

337
00:25:26,568 --> 00:25:28,236
What did your mother call you?

338
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:31,448
Shae. What did your mother call you?

339
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:33,908
My mother died giving birth to me.

340
00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:37,662
Is that why I'm here?
So we can talk about our mothers?

341
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:41,041
- What sort of accent is that?
- Foreign.

342
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:42,834
For...

343
00:25:44,753 --> 00:25:46,129
What do you want from me?

344
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,007
What do I want from you?

345
00:25:49,132 --> 00:25:52,093
I want you to share my tent.

346
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:55,221
I want you to pour my wine
laugh at my jokes,

347
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:57,891
rub my legs when they're sore
after a day's ride.

348
00:25:58,683 --> 00:26:02,020
I want you to take no other man to bed
for as long as we're together.

349
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:06,733
And I want you to fuck me
like it's my last night in this world.

350
00:26:06,858 --> 00:26:08,860
Which it may well be.

351
00:26:08,985 --> 00:26:10,528
And what do I get?

352
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:12,238
One - safety.

353
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:16,409
No one will hurt you
for as long as you're mine.

354
00:26:17,535 --> 00:26:20,163
Two - the pleasure of my company,

355
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:22,916
which I have heard is spectacular.

356
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:25,168
Who told you this?
Women you paid?

357
00:26:25,293 --> 00:26:26,878
And three...

358
00:26:27,796 --> 00:26:31,049
more gold than you can spend
if you lived a thousand years.

359
00:26:32,842 --> 00:26:35,011
Do you accept my proposal?

360
00:26:53,947 --> 00:26:56,908
Let's start with your last night in this world.

361
00:27:29,774 --> 00:27:31,234
Khaleesi.

362
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:32,402
Come.

363
00:27:34,946 --> 00:27:36,948
He's very strong.

364
00:27:37,073 --> 00:27:39,784
No one understands how strong he is.

365
00:27:59,095 --> 00:28:01,806
- He will die tonight, Khaleesi.
- He can't.

366
00:28:02,682 --> 00:28:04,559
He can't. I won't let him.

367
00:28:04,684 --> 00:28:07,770
Even a queen doesn't have that power.

368
00:28:10,648 --> 00:28:13,902
We must go quickly.
I've heard there's a good port in Asshai.

369
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:18,072
- I won't leave him.
- He's already gone, Khaleesi.

370
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:20,158
Doth...

371
00:28:20,283 --> 00:28:21,993
Even if...

372
00:28:24,078 --> 00:28:25,496
Even if he dies...

373
00:28:26,748 --> 00:28:28,041
why would I run?

374
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:33,755
I am khaleesi, and my...
my son will be khal after Drogo.

375
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,008
This isn't Westeros, where men honor blood.

376
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:41,721
Here they only honor strength.
There will be fighting after Drogo dies.

377
00:28:41,846 --> 00:28:44,557
Whoever wins that fight will be the new khal.

378
00:28:44,682 --> 00:28:46,684
He won't want any rivals.

379
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:51,481
Your boy will be plucked from your breast
and given to the dogs.

380
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:55,360
I won't...leave him.

381
00:29:05,536 --> 00:29:07,080
The wound has festered.

382
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:10,166
You did this, Witch.

383
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:12,085
Stop it!

384
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:13,753
I don't want her hurt.

385
00:29:13,878 --> 00:29:19,050
No? No?
You don't want her hurt?

386
00:29:19,592 --> 00:29:27,016
Pray we don't hurt you, too.
You let this witch put her hands on our Khal.

387
00:29:27,141 --> 00:29:30,770
Rein in your tongue.
She is still your Khaleesi.

388
00:29:30,895 --> 00:29:33,690
Only while the blood of my blood lives.

389
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:41,614
When he dies, she is nothing.

390
00:29:46,661 --> 00:29:52,750
I have never been nothing.
I am the blood of the dragon.

391
00:29:54,419 --> 00:30:00,258
The dragons are all dead, Khaleesi.

392
00:30:07,807 --> 00:30:10,310
I think you should wear your armor tonight, ser.

393
00:30:11,352 --> 00:30:13,104
I think you're right.

394
00:30:18,401 --> 00:30:22,322
- You've saved me once more.
- And now you must save him.

395
00:30:22,447 --> 00:30:24,657
He's beyond the healer's skills.

396
00:30:24,782 --> 00:30:27,160
All I can do is ease his path.

397
00:30:27,285 --> 00:30:29,454
Save him and I will free you. I swear it.

398
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:32,665
You must know a way.

399
00:30:33,291 --> 00:30:34,500
Some...

400
00:30:35,877 --> 00:30:37,211
Some magic.

401
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:41,007
There is a spell.

402
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:44,385
Some would say death is cleaner.

403
00:30:54,312 --> 00:30:55,980
Do it.

404
00:30:56,856 --> 00:30:58,566
Save him.

405
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:01,486
- There is a price.
- You'll have gold, whatever you want.

406
00:31:01,611 --> 00:31:03,863
It's not a matter of gold.
This is bloodmagic.

407
00:31:03,988 --> 00:31:05,990
Only death pays for life.

408
00:31:09,494 --> 00:31:11,037
My death?

409
00:31:11,162 --> 00:31:13,915
No, not your death, Khaleesi.

410
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:17,293
Bring me his horse.

411
00:31:40,858 --> 00:31:42,568
Khaleesi, do not do this thing.

412
00:31:42,693 --> 00:31:45,988
- Let me kill this witch.
- Kill her and you kill your khal.

413
00:31:46,114 --> 00:31:49,033
This is bloodmagic.
It is forbidden.

414
00:31:49,158 --> 00:31:52,745
I am your khaleesi.
I tell you what is forbidden.

415
00:32:03,297 --> 00:32:04,465
Go. Now.

416
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:06,467
- Take her and leave.
- Uh-uh.

417
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:07,760
Take her!

418
00:32:13,641 --> 00:32:17,562
You must go also, lady. Once I begin to sing,
no one must enter the tent.

419
00:32:17,687 --> 00:32:20,231
The dead will dance here tonight.

420
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:35,329
No one will enter.

421
00:32:43,588 --> 00:32:45,923
Bring him back to me.

422
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,108
What have you done?

423
00:33:04,233 --> 00:33:06,486
I have to save him.

424
00:33:06,611 --> 00:33:09,864
We could have been 10 miles
away from here by now, on the way to Asshai.

425
00:33:09,989 --> 00:33:11,949
You would have been safe.

426
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:21,709
This must not be.

427
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:23,336
This must be.

428
00:33:23,461 --> 00:33:24,670
Witch.

429
00:33:27,006 --> 00:33:28,633
No, you can't.

430
00:33:28,758 --> 00:33:30,635
Khaleesi!

431
00:33:32,136 --> 00:33:34,472
No further, horselord.

432
00:34:15,346 --> 00:34:16,472
Are you hurt?

433
00:34:16,597 --> 00:34:17,557
- The baby...
- Hmm?

434
00:34:17,682 --> 00:34:19,308
..Is coming.

435
00:34:19,433 --> 00:34:23,271
- Fetch the midwives.
- They will not come. They say she is cursed.

436
00:34:24,689 --> 00:34:26,816
They'll come or I'll have their heads.

437
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:31,737
The witch - she can bring baby.
I hear her say so.

438
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:56,846
Are you in agony, my lion?

439
00:34:56,971 --> 00:34:59,390
- No.
- You look like you're in agony.

440
00:35:00,308 --> 00:35:02,893
The fire is burning your pretty soft skin.

441
00:35:06,564 --> 00:35:08,149
' Ah!

442
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,445
Damn you, woman.
Are you immune to pain'?

443
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:14,614
- Just used to it.
- Drink.

444
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:18,743
Let's play a new game.

445
00:35:20,244 --> 00:35:22,830
There's a Braavosi knife game
I could teach you.

446
00:35:22,955 --> 00:35:26,042
Does it involve the potential
for losing fingers?

447
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:28,669
- Not if you win.
- No!

448
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:31,339
No fire games, no knife games.

449
00:35:32,256 --> 00:35:36,302
- Let's do something I'm good at.
- What are you good at?

450
00:35:36,427 --> 00:35:38,304
I happen to be a great judge of character.

451
00:35:38,429 --> 00:35:40,640
- This sounds like a boring game.
- It's not.

452
00:35:40,765 --> 00:35:44,852
Here's how it works -
I make a statement about your past.

453
00:35:44,977 --> 00:35:48,105
If I'm right, you drink.
If I'm wrong, I drink.

454
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:51,108
And no lying.
I'll know if you're lying.

455
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:53,069
I don't want to play this game.

456
00:35:53,194 --> 00:35:55,112
Fine. Bronn first.

457
00:35:59,784 --> 00:36:01,577
Your father beat you.

458
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:09,251
But my mother hit harder.

459
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:15,174
You killed your first man
before you were 12.

460
00:36:15,299 --> 00:36:17,093
It was a woman.

461
00:36:20,388 --> 00:36:21,722
She swung an axe at me.

462
00:36:23,474 --> 00:36:25,059
You've been north of the Wall.

463
00:36:28,479 --> 00:36:30,147
What brought you up there?

464
00:36:31,774 --> 00:36:33,567
- Work.
- And...

465
00:36:34,694 --> 00:36:38,030
you once loved a woman many years ago,
but it turned out badly

466
00:36:38,155 --> 00:36:39,949
so you've never let yourself love again.

467
00:36:41,826 --> 00:36:44,161
Oh, wait, that's me.

468
00:36:47,415 --> 00:36:50,167
Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty.

469
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:51,836
I don't want to play.

470
00:36:51,961 --> 00:36:55,715
It's fun! Look at the fun we're having.

471
00:36:59,301 --> 00:37:01,345
Your mother was a whore.

472
00:37:02,346 --> 00:37:03,514
Drink.

473
00:37:10,104 --> 00:37:12,189
All right.

474
00:37:12,314 --> 00:37:15,735
Your father left the family when
you were very young, never to return.

475
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,986
Drink.

476
00:37:18,195 --> 00:37:21,031
- And we've established the rules about lying?
- Drink!

477
00:37:24,368 --> 00:37:25,953
Mm.

478
00:37:28,497 --> 00:37:29,999
You wanted a different life.

479
00:37:30,124 --> 00:37:32,835
You came from somewhere
and you wanted to be elsewhere.

480
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,629
The whole shit-stained world
could drink off that one.

481
00:37:35,755 --> 00:37:37,840
So, specifics...

482
00:37:37,965 --> 00:37:41,427
You wanted to be elsewhere,
but how would you get there?

483
00:37:41,552 --> 00:37:45,306
I don't believe the life
of the Silent Sisters is for you.

484
00:37:45,431 --> 00:37:49,101
So...what's a lowborn girl to do?

485
00:37:52,772 --> 00:37:54,023
Drink.

486
00:37:56,859 --> 00:37:58,569
- Are you sure...
- Drink!

487
00:38:04,158 --> 00:38:07,953
And don't talk about
my mother and father ever,

488
00:38:08,078 --> 00:38:10,581
or I will carve your eyes from your head

489
00:38:15,085 --> 00:38:18,005
My dear lady,
if I have offended you, I apologize.

490
00:38:19,173 --> 00:38:20,132
My turn.

491
00:38:20,257 --> 00:38:22,301
Fine, fine.

492
00:38:22,426 --> 00:38:23,928
Ask away.

493
00:38:24,804 --> 00:38:27,681
Try to penetrate the enigma that is me.

494
00:38:27,807 --> 00:38:30,726
- Who were you in love with?
- That's not how the game works.

495
00:38:30,851 --> 00:38:33,187
I don't care the way the game works.

496
00:38:33,312 --> 00:38:35,272
Our lord here used to be married.

497
00:38:36,273 --> 00:38:38,359
- Married?
- How did you hear that?

498
00:38:38,484 --> 00:38:41,779
You hear lots of things
playing dice with Lannister soldiers.

499
00:38:44,323 --> 00:38:45,950
Another night, perhaps.

500
00:38:47,117 --> 00:38:49,078
Not another night. This night.

501
00:38:50,621 --> 00:38:52,248
It's not a pleasant story.

502
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:55,835
Oh, maybe I will cry.

503
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:00,422
I'm guessing the lady and I can tell more
unpleasant stories than your lordship.

504
00:39:02,591 --> 00:39:04,635
So...

505
00:39:08,055 --> 00:39:13,769
I was 16. My brother Jaime and I were riding,
when we heard a scream.

506
00:39:13,894 --> 00:39:18,357
She ran out onto the road,
clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels.

507
00:39:18,482 --> 00:39:22,987
Jaime scared away the men easily enough,
while I wrapped her in my cloak.

508
00:39:23,112 --> 00:39:24,905
She was too scared to send off on her own,

509
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:30,035
so while Jaime hunted down the rapers
I took her to the nearest inn and fed her.

510
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,538
Her name was Tysha.

511
00:39:32,663 --> 00:39:34,832
She was a wheelwright's orphan.

512
00:39:34,957 --> 00:39:37,126
And she was hungry.

513
00:39:37,251 --> 00:39:40,504
Together we finished off three chickens
and a flagon of wine.

514
00:39:40,629 --> 00:39:44,800
Impossible as it seems, there was a time
when I was unaccustomed to wine.

515
00:39:44,925 --> 00:39:48,053
I forgot how afraid I was around girls...

516
00:39:48,178 --> 00:39:51,515
how I was always waiting
for them to laugh at me or...

517
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,933
look away embarrassed,

518
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:55,728
or ask me about my tall, handsome brother.

519
00:39:55,853 --> 00:39:58,188
I forgot about everything but Tysha.

520
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,234
And somehow I found myself in her bed.

521
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:05,237
For three chickens, I should hope so.

522
00:40:05,362 --> 00:40:08,407
It didn't last long.
I didn't know what the hell I was doing.

523
00:40:08,532 --> 00:40:10,868
But she was good to me.

524
00:40:10,993 --> 00:40:12,953
She kissed me afterwards and...

525
00:40:13,996 --> 00:40:15,456
sang me a song.

526
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:20,586
And by morning
I was deep enough in love to ask for her hand.

527
00:40:21,587 --> 00:40:23,964
A few lies, a few gold coins,
one drunken septon

528
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:26,258
and there you have it - man and wife.

529
00:40:27,551 --> 00:40:32,264
For a fortnight anyway,
until the septon sobered up and told my father.

530
00:40:32,389 --> 00:40:34,892
Well, I imagine that was the end of all that.

531
00:40:35,017 --> 00:40:36,477
Not quite.

532
00:40:37,895 --> 00:40:40,606
First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth.

533
00:40:42,733 --> 00:40:44,735
The girl was a whore, you see.

534
00:40:46,403 --> 00:40:51,450
Jaime had arranged the whole thing -
the road, the rapers...all of it.

535
00:40:51,575 --> 00:40:54,036
He thought it was time I had a woman.

536
00:40:56,163 --> 00:40:58,248
After my brother confessed...

537
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:01,377
my father brought in my wife

538
00:41:01,502 --> 00:41:03,420
and gave her to his guards.

539
00:41:04,922 --> 00:41:07,675
He paid her well -
a silver for each man.

540
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,678
How many whores command
that kind of price?

541
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:15,975
He brought me into the barracks
and made me watch.

542
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:19,436
By the end, she had so much silver

543
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:24,274
that the coins were slipping through her fingers
and rolling on to the floor.

544
00:41:28,237 --> 00:41:31,115
I would have killed the man
who did that to me.

545
00:41:32,074 --> 00:41:34,243
You should have known she was a whore.

546
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:36,203
Really?

547
00:41:37,037 --> 00:41:39,498
I was 16, drunk and in love.

548
00:41:39,623 --> 00:41:44,962
A girl who was almost raped doesn't invite
another man into her bed two hours later.

549
00:41:46,046 --> 00:41:49,591
As I said, I was young and stupid.

550
00:41:52,302 --> 00:41:54,513
You are still young and stupid.

551
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:43,062
- What'?
- They stole a night's march on us.

552
00:42:43,187 --> 00:42:44,688
They're a mile north.

553
00:42:45,522 --> 00:42:47,900
- Get my squire!
- You don't have a squire.

554
00:42:50,402 --> 00:42:52,321
If I die, weep for me.

555
00:42:53,697 --> 00:42:56,617
You'll be dead.
How will you know?

556
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:04,833
I'll know.

557
00:43:07,086 --> 00:43:08,629
Watch out! Move!

558
00:43:09,755 --> 00:43:11,381
Out of the way!

559
00:43:11,507 --> 00:43:13,383
Move aside!

560
00:43:19,807 --> 00:43:21,266
Stay low.

561
00:43:22,309 --> 00:43:23,811
Stay low?

562
00:43:23,936 --> 00:43:26,271
If you're lucky, no one will notice you.

563
00:43:26,396 --> 00:43:28,232
I was born lucky.

564
00:43:31,443 --> 00:43:33,737
Tribesmen of the Vale,

565
00:43:33,862 --> 00:43:35,155
gather round!

566
00:43:36,907 --> 00:43:39,284
Stone Crows!

567
00:43:39,409 --> 00:43:41,620
Black Ears!
Burned Men!

568
00:43:41,745 --> 00:43:44,331
- Moon Brothers!
-  And Painted Dogs!

569
00:43:44,456 --> 00:43:47,251
- And Painted Dogs!
-  Painted Dogs!

570
00:43:47,376 --> 00:43:50,254
Your dominion over the Vale begins now!

571
00:43:50,379 --> 00:43:53,215
Onward, to claim what is yours!

572
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,425
Half man! Half man!

573
00:43:55,551 --> 00:43:58,846
Half man! Half man!

574
00:43:58,971 --> 00:44:01,598
Half man! Half man!

575
00:44:01,723 --> 00:44:03,559
To battle!

576
00:44:46,101 --> 00:44:47,603
You're a shit warrior.

577
00:44:51,106 --> 00:44:52,482
I'm alive?

578
00:44:53,442 --> 00:44:54,985
You're alive.

579
00:45:00,449 --> 00:45:02,034
Did we win?

580
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:04,828
We wouldn't be having
this conversation if we didn't.

581
00:45:17,883 --> 00:45:20,219
How did our tribesmen do?

582
00:45:21,678 --> 00:45:23,847
Yeah, good.

583
00:45:24,932 --> 00:45:29,186
- It's nice to see them getting along.
-  You're wounded.

584
00:45:30,354 --> 00:45:32,314
Good of you to notice.

585
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:34,441
I hear we won.

586
00:45:34,566 --> 00:45:37,110
Huh! The scouts were wrong.

587
00:45:38,028 --> 00:45:40,906
There were 2,000 Stark bannermen, not 20.

588
00:45:41,949 --> 00:45:44,076
Did we get the Stark boy, at least?

589
00:45:44,201 --> 00:45:45,661
He wasn't here.

590
00:45:46,495 --> 00:45:48,205
Where was he?

591
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:50,707
With his other 18,000 men.

592
00:45:54,378 --> 00:45:56,505
And where are they?

593
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,558
- We should go, my lady.
- No!

594
00:46:13,981 --> 00:46:15,315
My lady!

595
00:46:17,567 --> 00:46:19,778
H3/ah! Hyah!

596
00:46:50,934 --> 00:46:55,063
By the time they knew what was happening,
it had already happened.

597
00:46:58,442 --> 00:47:02,487
Lady Stark. I'd offer you my sword,
but I seem to have lost it.

598
00:47:02,612 --> 00:47:04,531
It is not your sword I want.

599
00:47:06,074 --> 00:47:07,659
Give me my daughters back.

600
00:47:07,784 --> 00:47:09,619
Give me my husband.

601
00:47:10,454 --> 00:47:12,247
I've lost them too, I'm afraid.

602
00:47:12,372 --> 00:47:14,833
Kill him, Robb.
Send his head to his father.

603
00:47:14,958 --> 00:47:19,713
- He cut down ten of our men. You saw him.
- He's more use to us alive than dead.

604
00:47:19,838 --> 00:47:22,924
Take him away and put him in irons.

605
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:25,510
We could end this war right now, boy,

606
00:47:25,635 --> 00:47:27,637
save thousands of lives.

607
00:47:27,763 --> 00:47:30,640
You fight for the Starks,
I fight for the Lannisters.

608
00:47:30,766 --> 00:47:32,726
Swords or lances, teeth, nails -

609
00:47:32,851 --> 00:47:36,563
choose your weapons
and let's end this here and now.

610
00:47:39,107 --> 00:47:41,234
If we do it your way, Kingslayer...

611
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:44,029
you'd win.

612
00:47:47,157 --> 00:47:48,658
We're not doing it your way.

613
00:47:50,535 --> 00:47:52,412
Come on, pretty man.

614
00:48:01,421 --> 00:48:06,218
- I sent 2,000 men to their graves today.
- The bards will sing songs of their sacrifice.

615
00:48:06,343 --> 00:48:09,346
Aye. But the dead won't hear them.

616
00:48:16,353 --> 00:48:19,064
One victory does not make us conquerors.

617
00:48:20,857 --> 00:48:22,943
Did we free my father?

618
00:48:23,985 --> 00:48:26,488
Did we rescue my sisters from the queen?

619
00:48:27,989 --> 00:48:31,535
Did we free the North from those
who want us on our knees?

620
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,209
This war is far from over.

621
00:49:10,532 --> 00:49:12,117
Could I have one?

622
00:49:12,242 --> 00:49:13,994
A lemon one...or any of them.

623
00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:15,745
Three coppers.

624
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:20,250
- How about a nice fat pigeon'?
- Oh, piss off now. Go on.

625
00:49:21,334 --> 00:49:24,171
Do you have any stale ones from yesterday?
Or any burnt ones?

626
00:49:24,296 --> 00:49:25,755
Piss off!

627
00:49:33,138 --> 00:49:35,182
Hey, where's everyone going?
What's happening'?

628
00:49:35,307 --> 00:49:37,476
- They're taking him to the Sept of Baelor.
- Who?

629
00:49:37,601 --> 00:49:39,519
The Hand of the King.

630
00:50:46,962 --> 00:50:49,130
- Traitor!
- Coward!

631
00:50:49,256 --> 00:50:51,299
Baelor.

632
00:50:51,424 --> 00:50:52,634
Baelor!

633
00:50:58,390 --> 00:51:01,017
Traitor! Traitor!

634
00:51:21,162 --> 00:51:23,373
I am Eddard Stark...

635
00:51:23,498 --> 00:51:25,500
Lord of Winterfell...

636
00:51:25,625 --> 00:51:27,961
and Hand of the King.

637
00:51:37,178 --> 00:51:39,639
I come before you to confess my treason...

638
00:51:40,849 --> 00:51:42,726
in the sight of gods and men.

639
00:51:44,728 --> 00:51:46,396
I betrayed the faith of my king...

640
00:51:47,522 --> 00:51:49,524
and the trust of my friend Robert.

641
00:51:50,942 --> 00:51:53,403
I swore to protect and defend his children.

642
00:51:54,362 --> 00:51:56,406
But before his blood was cold...

643
00:51:57,407 --> 00:52:00,160
I plotted to murder his son...

644
00:52:00,285 --> 00:52:02,787
and seize the throne for myself.

645
00:52:13,256 --> 00:52:19,095
Let the High Septon and Baelor the Blessed
bear witness to what I say...

646
00:52:22,223 --> 00:52:24,184
Joffrey Baratheon...

647
00:52:25,268 --> 00:52:27,437
is the one true heir to the Iron Throne...

648
00:52:28,563 --> 00:52:30,982
by the grace of all the gods,

649
00:52:31,107 --> 00:52:33,318
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms...

650
00:52:33,443 --> 00:52:35,612
and Protector of the Realm.

651
00:52:43,078 --> 00:52:44,996
As... As we sin...

652
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:47,499
so do we suffer.

653
00:52:47,624 --> 00:52:50,669
This man has confessed his crimes...

654
00:52:50,794 --> 00:52:53,213
in sight of gods and men.

655
00:52:53,922 --> 00:52:56,508
The gods are just...

656
00:52:56,633 --> 00:53:00,095
but beloved Baelor taught us...

657
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:02,681
they can also be merciful.

658
00:53:06,142 --> 00:53:10,230
What is to be done
with this traitor, Your Grace'?

659
00:53:15,151 --> 00:53:18,196
My mother wishes me
to let Lord Eddard join the Night's Watch.

660
00:53:18,321 --> 00:53:23,660
Stripped of all titles and powers,
he would serve the realm in permanent exile

661
00:53:23,785 --> 00:53:27,831
And my Lady Sansa...
has begged mercy for her father.

662
00:53:32,544 --> 00:53:34,921
But they have the soft hearts of women.

663
00:53:36,256 --> 00:53:38,174
So long as I am your king...

664
00:53:38,299 --> 00:53:41,094
treason shall never go unpunished.

665
00:53:42,178 --> 00:53:43,346
Ser llyn...

666
00:53:44,681 --> 00:53:45,849
bring me his head!

667
00:53:45,974 --> 00:53:48,059
No!

668
00:53:48,184 --> 00:53:50,019
Someone stop him!

669
00:54:01,322 --> 00:54:03,283
My son, this is madness.

670
00:54:04,242 --> 00:54:05,493
Put him down!

671
00:54:12,876 --> 00:54:15,211
- Don't look!
- Let me go! Let me go!

672
00:54:15,336 --> 00:54:17,881
Shut your mouth!
Look at me! Look at me!

673
00:54:18,006 --> 00:54:20,425
Stop! Daddy! Stop!

674
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:22,427
- No! No!
-  Traitor!

675
00:54:22,552 --> 00:54:23,887
Stop!

676
00:54:27,474 --> 00:54:29,100
Stop him! Stop!
