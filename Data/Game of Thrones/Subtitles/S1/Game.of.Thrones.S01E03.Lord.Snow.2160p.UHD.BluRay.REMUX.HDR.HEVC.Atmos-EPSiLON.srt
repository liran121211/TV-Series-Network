1
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:17,888
Welcome, Lord Stark.

2
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:21,058
Grand Maester Pycelle has called
a meeting of the Small Council.

3
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:23,143
The honor of your presence
is requested.

4
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:27,814
Get the girls settled in.
I'll be back in time for supper.

5
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:30,525
- And, Jory, you go with them.
- Yes, my lord.

6
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:34,154
If you'd like to change into
something more appropriate...

7
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:12,693
Thank the gods you're here, Stark.

8
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:16,905
About time we had some
stern northern leadership.

9
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:19,825
Glad to see you're protecting the throne.

10
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,910
Sturdy old thing.

11
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,371
How many kings' arses have
polished it, I wonder?

12
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,248
Um, what's the line?

13
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:29,626
The king shits and the Hand wipes.

14
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:31,962
Very handsome armor.

15
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,465
- Not a scratch on it.
- I know.

16
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,136
People have been swinging at me for years,
but they always seem to miss.

17
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:41,930
You've chosen your opponents wisely then.

18
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,183
I have a knack for it.

19
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:51,440
It must be strange for you,
coming into this room.

20
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:56,695
I was standing right here
when it happened.

21
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,781
He was very brave, your brother.

22
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,658
Your father, too.

23
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,827
They didn't deserve to die like that.

24
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,747
Nobody deserves to die like that.

25
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:08,665
But you just stood there and watched.

26
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,752
500 men just stood there and watched.

27
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,504
All the great knights
of the Seven Kingdoms.

28
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,965
You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger?

29
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,593
No, Lord Stark.

30
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:23,805
500 men and this room
was silent as a crypt.

31
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:29,060
Except for the screams, of course,

32
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:31,146
and the Mad King laughing.

33
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,856
And later...

34
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:36,526
when I watched the Mad King die,

35
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:39,946
I remembered him laughing
as your father burned...

36
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:42,949
It felt like justice.

37
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:48,580
Is that what you tell
yourself at night?

38
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:52,501
You're a servant of justice?

39
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:57,088
That you were avenging my father when you
shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back?

40
00:04:57,214 --> 00:05:01,968
Tell me, if I'd stabbed the Mad King
in the belly instead of the back,

41
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,804
would you admire me more?

42
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:09,017
You served him well...
when serving was safe.

43
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:24,199
Lord Stark.

44
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,119
Lord Varys.

45
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:31,915
I was grievously sorry to hear
of your troubles on the Kingsroad.

46
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,710
We are all praying for Prince
Joffrey's full recovery.

47
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:39,047
A shame you didn't say a prayer
for the butcher's son.

48
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:43,468
Renly! You're looking well.

49
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,262
And you look tired from the road.

50
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:47,597
I told them this meeting could
wait another day, but...

51
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:50,392
But we have a kingdom to look after.

52
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,603
I've hoped to meet you
for some time, Lord Stark.

53
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:57,190
- No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me.
- She has, Lord Baelish.

54
00:05:57,315 --> 00:06:00,318
I understand you knew
my brother Brandon as well.

55
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:03,613
All too well.
I still carry a token of his esteem...

56
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,615
from navel to collarbone.

57
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,784
Perhaps you chose the wrong
man to duel with.

58
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,703
It wasn't the man
that I chose, my lord.

59
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:12,122
It was Catelyn Tully.

60
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:15,458
A woman worth fighting for,
I'm sure you'll agree.

61
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:18,128
I humbly beg your pardon,
my Lord Stark.

62
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:20,797
Grand Maester.

63
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,133
How many years has it been?

64
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:26,761
- You were a young man.
- And you served another king.

65
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,308
Oh, how forgetful of me.

66
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:35,103
This belongs to you now.

67
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:39,608
Should we begin?

68
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,652
- Without the king?
- Winter may be coming,

69
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:46,031
but I'm afraid the same cannot
be said for my brother.

70
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:48,158
His Grace has many cares.

71
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:52,954
He entrusts some small matters to us
that we might lighten the load.

72
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,874
We are the lords of small matters here.

73
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,840
My brother instructs us
to stage a tournament

74
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,343
in honor of Lord Stark's appointment
as Hand of the King.

75
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:10,013
- Mm, how much?
- 40,000 gold dragons to the champion,

76
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,681
20,000 to the runner-up,

77
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,851
20,000 to the winning archer.

78
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,228
Can the treasury bear such expense?

79
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:20,190
I'll have to borrow it.
The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect.

80
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:23,526
We already owe Lord Tywin three million gold.
What's another 80,000?

81
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:25,403
Are you telling me the Crown
is three million in debt?

82
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:29,324
- I'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt.
- How could you let this happen?

83
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:33,620
The master of coin finds the money.
The king and the Hand spend it.

84
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:37,207
I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed
Robert to bankrupt the realm.

85
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:40,168
Lord Arryn gave wise
and prudent advice,

86
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:44,005
but I fear His Grace
doesn't always listen.

87
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,591
"Counting coppers," he calls it.

88
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,511
I'll speak to him tomorrow.

89
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,846
This tournament is an extravagance
we cannot afford.

90
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,349
As you will. But still,
we'd best make our plans.

91
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,352
There will be no plans...
until I speak to Robert.

92
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,401
Forgive me, my lords. I'm...

93
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:08,947
- I had a long ride.
- You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark.

94
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:11,533
We serve at your pleasure.

95
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,625
- Ow!
- Please, it's nearly healed.

96
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:26,548
- It's ugly.
- A king should have scars.

97
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:30,385
You fought off a direwolf.
You're a warrior like your father.

98
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,222
I'm not like him. I didn't fight off anything.
It bit me and all I did was scream.

99
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:36,975
And the two Stark girls
saw it, both of them.

100
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,103
That's not true. You killed the beast.

101
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:43,356
You only spared the girl because
of the love your father bears her father.

102
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:44,858
I didn't, I...

103
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:49,612
When Aerys Targaryen sat on the iron throne,
your father was a rebel and a traitor.

104
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:53,324
Someday you'll sit on the throne and
the truth will be what you make it.

105
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,913
Do I have to marry her?

106
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,833
Yes.

107
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,127
She's very beautiful and young.

108
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:07,422
If you don't like her, you only need
to see her on formal occasions

109
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:11,926
and when the time comes,
to make little princes and princesses.

110
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:16,973
And if you'd rather fuck painted
whores, you'll fuck painted whores.

111
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,601
And if you'd rather lie
with noble virgins, so be it.

112
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:23,897
You are my darling boy and the world
will be exactly as you want it to be.

113
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,819
Do something nice for the Stark girl.

114
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,696
- I don't want to.
- No, but you will.

115
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:36,659
The occasional kindness will spare you
all sorts of trouble down the road.

116
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:39,329
We allow the northerners
too much power.

117
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:41,831
They consider themselves our equals.

118
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,500
How would you handle them?

119
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:49,255
I'd double their taxes and command them
to supply 10,000 men to the royal army.

120
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,548
A royal army?

121
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,509
Why should every lord
command his own men?

122
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:54,761
It's primitive, no better
than the hill tribes.

123
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:57,972
We should have a standing army
of men loyal to the Crown,

124
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,724
trained by experienced soldiers,

125
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:03,478
instead of a mob of peasants
who've never held pikes in their lives.

126
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,939
And if the northerners rebel?

127
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:07,607
I'd crush them.

128
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:11,861
Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal
to the realm as warden of the North.

129
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,363
Uncle Kevan, maybe.

130
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:17,158
And these 10,000 northern troops,
would they fight for you or their lord?

131
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,452
- For me. I'm their king.
- Mm-hm.

132
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,538
But you've just invaded their homeland,

133
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:24,374
- asked them to kill their brothers.
- I'm not asking.

134
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:27,418
The North cannot be held,
not by an outsider.

135
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,546
It's too big and too wild.

136
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,214
And when the winter comes,
the seven gods together

137
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,466
couldn't save you and your royal army.

138
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,427
A good king knows when
to save his strength...

139
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,431
and when to destroy his enemies.

140
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:43,143
So you agree...

141
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,520
the Starks are enemies?

142
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:51,359
Everyone who isn't us... is an enemy.

143
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,115
Enough of that, young lady.
Eat your food.

144
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,200
- I'm practicing.
- Practicing for what?

145
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,244
- The prince.
- Arya, stop!

146
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:04,497
He's a liar and a coward
and he killed my friend.

147
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,874
The Hound killed your friend.

148
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,459
The Hound does whatever
the prince tells him to do.

149
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,879
- You're an idiot.
- You're a liar, and if you told the truth,

150
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,213
Mycah would be alive.

151
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,715
Enough!

152
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,969
What's happening here?

153
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,346
Arya would rather act
like a beast than a lady.

154
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,392
Go to your room. We'll speak later.

155
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:33,902
That's for you, love.

156
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:47,081
The same dollmaker makes
all of Princess Myrcella's toys.

157
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,585
Don't you like it?

158
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:54,214
I haven't played with dolls
since I was eight.

159
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,801
- May I be excused?
- You've barely eaten a thing.

160
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:02,013
It's all right. Go on.

161
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,358
War was easier than daughters.

162
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,490
Go away!

163
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:23,034
Arya, open the door.

164
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:35,255
May I come in?

165
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:44,514
- Whose sword is that?
- Mine.

166
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,266
Give it to me.

167
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,858
I know this maker's mark.
This is Mikken's work.

168
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,821
Where did you get this?

169
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:05,994
This is no toy.

170
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,832
- Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.
- I wasn't playing.

171
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,875
And I don't want to be a lady.

172
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,169
Come here.

173
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:22,760
Now what do you want with this?

174
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:25,179
It's called Needle.

175
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:27,348
Oh, a blade with a name.

176
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:31,060
And who were you hoping
to skewer with Needle?

177
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,104
Your sister?

178
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,481
Do you know the first thing
about sword fighting?

179
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,358
Stick 'em with the pointy end.

180
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,278
That's the essence of it.

181
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,283
I was trying to learn.

182
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,829
I asked Mycah to practice with me.

183
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:55,376
I asked him. It was my fault.

184
00:13:56,169 --> 00:14:00,715
No, sweet girl.
No, no, you didn't kill the butcher's boy.

185
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:05,219
I hate them. I hate all of them.

186
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,597
The Hound, the queen and the king

187
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:09,265
and Joffrey and Sansa.

188
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,060
Sansa was dragged before
the king and queen...

189
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:15,646
and asked to call the prince a liar.

190
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:18,274
So was I! He is a liar.

191
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,401
Shh, darling, listen to me.

192
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,530
Sansa will be married
to Joffrey someday.

193
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,283
She cannot betray him.

194
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:30,078
She must take his side
even when he's wrong.

195
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:34,040
But how you can let her
marry someone like that?

196
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:37,835
Well...

197
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,964
Look at me.

198
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:45,218
You're a Stark of Winterfell.
You know our words.

199
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:48,805
Winter is coming.

200
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:54,018
You were born in the long summer.
You've never known anything else.

201
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:56,437
But now winter is truly coming.

202
00:14:56,562 --> 00:15:00,525
And in the winter,
we must protect ourselves,

203
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,026
look after one another.

204
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,404
Sansa is your sister.

205
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,865
I don't hate her.

206
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:09,951
Not really.

207
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:15,123
I don't want to frighten you,
but I won't lie to you either.

208
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,625
We've come to a dangerous place.

209
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:21,129
We cannot fight a war
amongst ourselves.

210
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,132
All right?

211
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,427
Go on. It's yours.

212
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,598
I can keep it?

213
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,643
Try not to stab your sister with it.

214
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,531
if you're going to own a sword,
you'd better know how to use it.

215
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:00,084
Don't listen to it.
Crows are all liars.

216
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:06,215
- I know a story about a crow.
- I hate your stories.

217
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,427
I know a story about a boy
who hated stories.

218
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,097
I could tell you about
Ser Duncan the Tall.

219
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,099
Those were always your favorites.

220
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,518
Those weren't my favorites.

221
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,104
My favorites were the scary ones.

222
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:25,693
Oh, my sweet summer child.
What do you know about fear?

223
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:29,030
Fear is for the winter,

224
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:32,408
when the snows fall
a hundred feet deep.

225
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:36,913
Fear is for the long night,
when the sun hides for years

226
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:42,001
and children are born and live
and die, all in darkness.

227
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:45,755
That is the time for fear,
my little lord,

228
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,050
when the white walkers
move through the woods.

229
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:55,765
Thousands of years ago there came
a night that lasted a generation.

230
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,726
Kings froze to death in their castles,

231
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,978
same as the shepherds in their huts.

232
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:05,816
And women smothered their babies
rather than see them starve,

233
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:10,238
and wept and felt the tears
freeze on their cheeks.

234
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,866
So is this the sort
of story that you like?

235
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:21,666
In that darkness, the white
walkers came for the first time.

236
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,752
They swept through cities and kingdoms,

237
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,963
riding their dead horses,

238
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:30,883
hunting with their packs of pale
spiders big as hounds...

239
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:37,265
What are you telling him now?

240
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,725
Only what the little lord wants to hear.

241
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,395
Get your supper.
I want some time with him.

242
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:55,324
One time she told me

243
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,660
the sky is blue because
we live inside the eye

244
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:00,538
of a blue-eyed giant named Macomber.

245
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,748
Maybe we do.

246
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,211
How do you feel?

247
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,925
You still don't remember anything?

248
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:19,098
Bran, I've seen you climb
a thousand times.

249
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,017
In the wind, in the rain...

250
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:23,185
A thousand times.

251
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:25,521
- You never fall.
- I did though.

252
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,818
It's true, isn't it,

253
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:34,155
what Maester Luwin says about my legs?

254
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:43,623
I'd rather be dead.

255
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:48,127
- Don't ever say that.
- I'd rather be dead.

256
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:02,391
Fewer eyes back here, my lady.

257
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,560
But still too many.

258
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:07,229
It's nine years since I've
set foot in the capital.

259
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:10,566
And no one knew who I was
the last time I came, either.

260
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:16,656
My lady.

261
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:19,950
Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark.
Would you mind following us?

262
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,869
I would. We've done nothing wrong.

263
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,121
We've been instructed
to escort you into the city.

264
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,998
Instructed?

265
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,709
I don't know who's providing
your instructions, but...

266
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,461
Follow me, Lady Stark.

267
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:42,598
Cat!

268
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:46,018
Go on. Go upstairs.

269
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,940
You little worm!

270
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:55,194
You take me for some back-alley
Sally you can drag into a...

271
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,698
Pssst!

272
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:05,204
I meant no disrespect,
to you of all people.

273
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:09,291
How dare you bring me here?
Have you lost your mind?

274
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:11,877
No one will come looking for you here.
Isn't that what you wanted?

275
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:15,506
I'm truly sorry... about the locale.

276
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,925
How did you know I was
coming to King's Landing?

277
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:20,970
A dear friend told me.

278
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:25,516
- Lady Stark.
- Lord Varys.

279
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:29,603
To see you again after so
many years is a blessing.

280
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,105
Your poor hands.

281
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,192
How did you know I was coming?

282
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,653
Knowledge is my trade, my lady.

283
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,949
Did you bring the dagger
with you, by any chance?

284
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,911
My little birds are everywhere...

285
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,205
even in the North.

286
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,751
They whisper to me
the strangest stories.

287
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,216
Valyrian steel.

288
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:02,052
Do you know whose dagger this is?

289
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,723
I must admit I do not.

290
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,310
Well, well, this is an historic day.

291
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:13,647
Something you don't know that I do.

292
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:19,862
There's only one dagger like this
in all of the Seven Kingdoms.

293
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,949
- It's mine.
- Yours?

294
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:28,329
At least it was, until the tournament
on Prince Joffrey's last nameday.

295
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,332
I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting,

296
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:33,209
as any sane man would.

297
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:38,297
When the Knight of the Flowers
unseated him, I lost this dagger.

298
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,508
To whom?

299
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,510
Tyrion Lannister.

300
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,845
The Imp.

301
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,556
Grenn, show him what you
farm boys are made of.

302
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,815
if that were a real sword,
you'd be dead.

303
00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:01,570
Lord Snow here grew up in a castle
spitting down on the likes of you.

304
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,614
Pyp.

305
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:07,701
Do you think Ned Stark's bastard
bleeds like the rest of us?

306
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:17,670
Next!

307
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:29,890
Next!

308
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:47,199
Well, Lord Snow, it appears you're
the least useless person here.

309
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:49,493
Go clean yourselves up!

310
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:52,329
There's only so much
I can stomach in a day.

311
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,832
A charming man.

312
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,459
I don't need him to be charming.

313
00:22:57,585 --> 00:23:00,588
I need him to turn this bunch
of thieves and runaways

314
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:02,131
into men of the Night's Watch.

315
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:05,593
And how's that going,
Commander Mormont?

316
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,219
Slowly.

317
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:12,766
A raven came... for Ned Stark's son.

318
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:19,148
Good news or bad?

319
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:20,858
Both.

320
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:25,446
Lord Stark.

321
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:28,365
I meant... to give you this earlier.

322
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:32,661
So forgetful these days.

323
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:37,291
A raven from Winterfell this morning.

324
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:50,220
Good news?

325
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:56,185
Perhaps you'd like to share it
with your wife.

326
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:01,315
- My wife is in Winterfell.
- Is she?

327
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,700
Yes, I'm looking at you.

328
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:16,997
I thought that she'd be safest in here.

329
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,875
One of several such
establishments I own.

330
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:23,712
You're a funny man.

331
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:26,215
Huh? A very funny man.

332
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,718
Ned!

333
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:38,227
Ah, the Starks...

334
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:41,188
Quick tempers, slow minds.

335
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,904
You broke my nose, bastard!

336
00:24:57,121 --> 00:24:58,288
It's an improvement.

337
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:04,378
If we threw you over the Wall, I wonder
how long it would take you to hit.

338
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,755
I wonder if they'd find you
before the wolves did.

339
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:13,554
What are you looking at, halfman?

340
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,223
I'm looking at you.

341
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:21,478
Yes. You've got an interesting face.

342
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:25,649
Hmm, very distinctive faces.

343
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,359
All of you.

344
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:29,611
And what do you care about our faces?

345
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:31,488
It's just...

346
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:35,576
I think they would look marvelous
decorating spikes in King's Landing.

347
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:38,620
Perhaps I'll write to my sister,
the queen, about it.

348
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:43,208
We'll talk later, Lord Snow.

349
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:53,469
Everybody knew what this place
was and no one told me.

350
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:54,928
No one but you.

351
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:59,600
My father knew and he left me
to rot at the Wall all the same.

352
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:01,810
Grenn's father left him too...

353
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:05,064
outside a farmhouse, when he was three.

354
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:09,151
Pyp was caught stealing
a wheel of cheese.

355
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:12,529
His little sister hadn't
eaten in three days.

356
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:16,325
He was given a choice -
his right hand or the Wall.

357
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:20,329
I've been asking the Lord Commander
about them. Fascinating stories.

358
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:22,331
They hate me because
I'm better than they are.

359
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:26,835
It's a lucky thing none of them were trained
by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik.

360
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,421
I don't imagine any of them
had ever held a real sword

361
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,548
before they came here.

362
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,804
Oh...

363
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,972
Your brother Bran.

364
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:42,142
He's woken up.

365
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:46,522
The mere suggestion that the queen's
brother tried to kill your boy

366
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:47,856
would be considered treason.

367
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:50,192
We have proof. We have the blade.

368
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,319
Which Lord Tyrion will say
was stolen from him.

369
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,905
The only man who could say
otherwise has no throat,

370
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,281
thanks to your boy's wolf.

371
00:26:57,324 --> 00:27:00,160
Petyr has promised to help
us find the truth.

372
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:05,624
He's like a little brother to me, Ned.
He would never betray my trust.

373
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:08,210
I'll try to keep you alive,
for her sake.

374
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:10,045
A fool's task, admittedly,

375
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,714
but I've never been able
to refuse your wife anything.

376
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,883
I won't forget this.

377
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:17,052
You're a true friend.

378
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:20,305
Don't tell anyone.
I have a reputation to maintain.

379
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,979
- How could you be so stupid?
- Calm down.

380
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,856
He's a child. Ten years old.

381
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:31,316
- What were you thinking?
- I was thinking of us.

382
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:33,902
You're a bit late to start
complaining about it now.

383
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:37,823
- What has the boy told them?
- Nothing. He remembers nothing.

384
00:27:37,948 --> 00:27:39,992
Then what are you raving about?

385
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:43,537
What if it comes back to him?
If he tells his father what he saw...

386
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,914
We'll say he was lying.
We'll say he was dreaming.

387
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:49,877
We'll say whatever we like.
I think we can outfox a ten-year-old.

388
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:53,088
- And my husband?
- I'll go to war with him if I have to.

389
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,841
They can write a ballad about us -

390
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:57,634
"The War For Cersei's Cunt."

391
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:05,184
- Let me go.
- Never.

392
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:09,062
- Let me go.
- The boy won't talk.

393
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:12,149
And if he does, I'll kill him.

394
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:15,611
Him, Ned Stark, the king -
the whole bloody lot of them,

395
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:20,199
until you and I are the only
people left in this world.

396
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,170
I wish I could see the girls.

397
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:36,465
- It's too dangerous.
- Just for a moment.

398
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,759
Until we know who our enemies are.

399
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:40,969
I know they did it, Ned.
The Lannisters.

400
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:42,971
In my bones, I know it.

401
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:44,973
Littlefinger's right.

402
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,894
I can't do anything without proof.

403
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:51,521
And if you find the proof?

404
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:53,690
Then I bring it to Robert...

405
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:56,485
and hope he's still the man I once knew.

406
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,405
You watch yourself on the road, huh?

407
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:03,825
That temper of yours
is a dangerous thing.

408
00:29:03,951 --> 00:29:05,452
My temper?

409
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:09,456
Gods be good, you nearly killed
poor Littlefinger yesterday.

410
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:16,088
He still loves you.

411
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,007
Does he?

412
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,235
Off with you.

413
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:13,603
Yes, it's been a long time.

414
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:17,232
But I still remember every face.

415
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,944
You remember your first?

416
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:25,490
Of course, Your Grace.

417
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:27,576
Who was it?

418
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:29,286
A Tyroshi.

419
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:32,122
- Never learned the name.
- Hmm.

420
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,458
How did you do it?

421
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,501
Lance through the heart.

422
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,337
Quick one.

423
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:42,090
Lucky for you.

424
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:45,969
Mine was some Tarly boy
at the Battle of Summerhall.

425
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:52,059
My horse took an arrow so I was
on foot, slogging through the mud.

426
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:58,648
He came running at me,
this dumb high-born lad,

427
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:03,445
thinking he could end the rebellion
with a single swing of his sword.

428
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,823
I knocked him down with the hammer.

429
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:09,284
Gods, I was strong then.

430
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:12,120
Caved in his breastplate.

431
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:15,540
Probably shattered every rib he had.

432
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:19,252
Stood over him, hammer in the air.

433
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:25,425
Right before I brought it down
he shouted, "Wait! Wait."

434
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:34,726
They never tell you how
they all shit themselves.

435
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:39,147
They don't put that part in the songs.

436
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:43,110
Stupid boy.

437
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:50,450
Now the Tarlys bend the knee
like everyone else.

438
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:55,163
He could have lingered on the edge
of the battle with the smart boys,

439
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:58,875
and today his wife would be
making him miserable,

440
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,878
his sons would be ingrates,

441
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:06,466
and he'd be waking three times
in the night to piss into a bowl.

442
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,343
Wine!

443
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:15,475
Lancel. Gods, what a stupid name.

444
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:19,104
Lancel Lannister.

445
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:24,359
Who named you?
Some halfwit with a stutter?

446
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,489
What are you doing?

447
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:33,535
- It's empty, Your Grace.
- What do you mean, it's empty?

448
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,455
- There's no more wine.
- Is that what empty means?!

449
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,750
So get more.

450
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:47,007
Tell your cousin to get in here.

451
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:50,177
Kingslayer! Get in here.

452
00:32:57,851 --> 00:33:00,896
Surrounded by Lannisters.

453
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:04,733
Every time I close my eyes
I see their blond hair

454
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:08,195
and their smug, satisfied faces.

455
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:11,239
It must wound your pride, huh?

456
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:14,201
Standing out there
like a glorified sentry.

457
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:19,539
Jaime Lannister,
son of the mighty Tywin...

458
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:26,213
forced to mind the door while your king
eats and drinks and shits and fucks.

459
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:29,758
So come on.

460
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:31,843
We're telling war stories.

461
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:36,723
Who was your first kill,
not counting old men?

462
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:40,602
One of the outlaws in the brotherhood.

463
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:43,230
I was there that day.

464
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:46,399
You were only a squire, 16 years old.

465
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:49,361
You killed Simon Toyne
with a counter riposte.

466
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:51,613
Best move I ever saw.

467
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:55,992
A good fighter, Toyne,
but he lacked stamina.

468
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,245
Your outlaw...

469
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,789
any last words?

470
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:03,625
- I cut his head off, so no.
- Hmm.

471
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,628
What about Aerys Targaryen?

472
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:10,507
What did the Mad King say when
you stabbed him in the back?

473
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:12,759
I never asked.

474
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:15,720
Did he call you a traitor?

475
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:18,848
Did he plead for a reprieve?

476
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:23,353
He said the same thing
he'd been saying for hours...

477
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:27,232
"Burn them all."

478
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:33,947
if that's all, Your Grace...

479
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,690
Do the Dothraki buy their slaves?

480
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,859
The Dothraki don't believe in money.

481
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:13,194
Most of their slaves were
given to them as gifts.

482
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,696
From whom?

483
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:18,408
If you rule a city and you see the horde
approaching, you have two choices -

484
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,327
pay tribute or fight.

485
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:22,162
An easy choice for most.

486
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:25,624
Of course, sometimes it's not enough.

487
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:29,169
Sometimes a khal feels insulted
by the number of slaves he's given.

488
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:31,671
He might think the men too
weak or the women too ugly.

489
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:35,550
Sometimes a khal decides his riders
haven't had a good fight in months

490
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:38,637
and need the practice.

491
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,683
Tell them all to stop.

492
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,936
You want the entire horde to stop?
For how long?

493
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:50,815
Until I command them otherwise.

494
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:53,693
You're learning to talk like a queen.

495
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,737
Not a queen.

496
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,697
A khaleesi.

497
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:36,736
You dare!

498
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:40,156
You give commands to me? To me?

499
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:45,745
You do not command the dragon.
I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.

500
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:50,625
I don't take orders from savages
or their sluts. Do you hear me?

501
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:58,675
Rakharo ask if you want
him dead, Khaleesi.

502
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,301
No.

503
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:06,391
Rakharo say you should
take ear, to teach respect.

504
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:09,060
Please. Please, don't hurt him.

505
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:16,985
Tell him I don't want
my brother harmed.

506
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:22,115
Huh?

507
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:33,293
Mormont! Kill these Dothraki dogs!

508
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:41,301
I am your king!

509
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:45,472
Shall we return to the khalasar, Khaleesi?

510
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:07,786
Uh uh uh uh uh.

511
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:10,789
You... walk.

512
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:45,401
I wanted to be here when you
saw it for the first time.

513
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:56,871
- I'm leaving this morning.
- You're leaving?

514
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:00,166
I'm the First Ranger.

515
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,627
My job is out there.

516
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:05,880
- There have been disturbing reports.
- What kind of reports?

517
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,840
The kind I don't want to believe.

518
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:12,011
I'm ready. I won't let you down.

519
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:14,514
You're not going.

520
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:18,768
You're no ranger, Jon.

521
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:21,521
- But I'm better than every...
- Better than no one!

522
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:28,569
Here...

523
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:30,905
a man gets what he earns,

524
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,116
when he earns it.

525
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:39,247
We'll speak when I return.

526
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:57,932
- A bear's balls.
- Oh, you're joking?

527
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:01,477
And his brains and his guts,
his lungs and his heart,

528
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:04,105
all fried in his own fat.

529
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,774
When you're a hundred miles
north of the Wall

530
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:10,403
and you ate your last meal a week ago,
you leave nothing for the wolves.

531
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,573
And how do a bear's balls taste?

532
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:15,908
A bit chewy.

533
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:22,248
And what about you, my lord?
What's the strangest thing you've eaten?

534
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:23,958
Do Dornish girls count?

535
00:42:28,004 --> 00:42:33,301
So... you roam the Seven Kingdoms,
collaring pickpockets and horse thieves

536
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:35,428
and bring them here as eager recruits?

537
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,221
Aye.

538
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:40,308
But it's not all of 'em's
done bad things.

539
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:43,311
Some of 'em's just poor lads
looking for steady feed.

540
00:42:43,436 --> 00:42:46,272
Some of 'em's high-born
lads looking for glory.

541
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,524
They have a better chance
finding feed than glory.

542
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:53,279
The Night's Watch
is a joke to you, is it?

543
00:42:54,447 --> 00:42:58,659
Is that what we are, Lannister?
An army of jesters in black?

544
00:42:58,785 --> 00:43:00,828
You don't have enough men to be an army

545
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:04,582
and, aside from Yoren here,
none of you are particularly funny.

546
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:07,335
I hope we've provided you
with some good stories to tell

547
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,212
when you're back in King's Landing.

548
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:12,924
It's something to think about while
you're drinking your wine down there,

549
00:43:13,049 --> 00:43:15,051
enjoying your brothels.

550
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:19,472
Half the boys you've seen training
will die north of the Wall.

551
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:22,767
Might be a wildling's axe
that gets them,

552
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:25,520
might be sickness,

553
00:43:25,645 --> 00:43:28,314
might just be the cold.

554
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,191
They die in pain.

555
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,860
And they do it...

556
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:38,116
so plump little lords like you can enjoy their
summer afternoons in peace and comfort.

557
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:42,745
Do you think I'm plump?

558
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:49,669
- Listen, Benjen... May I call you Benjen?
- Call me what you like.

559
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:52,046
I'm not sure what I've done to offend you.

560
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:54,215
I have great admiration
for the Night's Watch.

561
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,801
I've great admiration
for you as First Ranger.

562
00:43:56,926 --> 00:43:58,886
You know, my brother once told me...

563
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:03,516
that nothing someone says
before the word "but" really counts.

564
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,268
But...

565
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:09,313
I don't believe that giants
and ghouls and white walkers

566
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:11,232
are lurking beyond the Wall.

567
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:15,403
I believe that the only difference
between us and the wildlings

568
00:44:15,528 --> 00:44:18,239
is that when that wall went up,
our ancestors happened

569
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:20,449
to live on the right side of it.

570
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:22,368
You're right.

571
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,205
The wildlings are no different from us.

572
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:29,083
A little rougher maybe.

573
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,878
But they're made of meat and bone.

574
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:34,547
I know how to track them
and I know how to kill them.

575
00:44:35,256 --> 00:44:38,384
It's not the wildlings
giving me sleepless nights.

576
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:44,098
You've never been north of the Wall,
so don't tell me what's out there.

577
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:49,645
Are you going below?

578
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:54,525
- Keep well, keep warm.
- Enjoy the capital, brother.

579
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,360
Oh, I always do.

580
00:45:05,578 --> 00:45:07,747
I think he's starting to like me.

581
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:13,920
- "Going below"?
- Aye.

582
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:17,798
Into the tunnel and out the other side.

583
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:20,509
He'll be north of the Wall
for a month or two.

584
00:45:22,762 --> 00:45:25,806
So... you're heading down
to King's Landing too.

585
00:45:25,932 --> 00:45:28,476
Aye, day after tomorrow.

586
00:45:28,601 --> 00:45:32,313
I get about half of my recruits
from their dungeons.

587
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:36,567
Let's share the road.
I could use some decent company.

588
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:38,819
I, er...

589
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:41,656
I travel a bit on the grubby side, my lord.

590
00:45:41,781 --> 00:45:45,660
Not this time. We'll be staying
at the finest castles and inns.

591
00:45:45,785 --> 00:45:48,162
No one turns away a Lannister.

592
00:46:04,345 --> 00:46:06,013
Yes, Khaleesi.

593
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:10,017
Oh, what are you doing?

594
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:12,645
When was last time you bleed, Khaleesi?

595
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:17,108
You change, Khaleesi.

596
00:46:18,526 --> 00:46:20,903
<font color="#ffff00">It's a blessing from the Great Stallion</font>

597
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:30,329
For a man on horseback,
the curved blade is a good thing,

598
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,164
easier to handle.

599
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:35,167
It's a good weapon for a Dothrakan.

600
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:40,464
But a man in full plate...

601
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:42,675
...the arakh won't get through the steel.

602
00:46:43,843 --> 00:46:46,012
That's where the broadsword
has the advantage.

603
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:49,015
Designed for piercing plate.

604
00:46:50,683 --> 00:46:53,436
<font color="#ffff00">Dothraki don't wear steel dresses.</font>

605
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:56,480
- Armor.
- Armor.

606
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:59,233
Armor make a man, erm...

607
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:01,319
Slow.

608
00:47:01,444 --> 00:47:05,031
- Slow.
- It's true, but it also keeps a man alive.

609
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:09,201
<font color="#ffff00">My father taught me how to fight.</font>

610
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:12,705
<font color="#ffff00">He taught me that speed defeats size.</font>

611
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,583
<font color="#ffff00">I've heard that your father
was a famous warrior.</font>

612
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:18,044
<font color="#ffff00">He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo.</font>

613
00:47:20,713 --> 00:47:24,508
<font color="#ffff00">And your father, Jorah the Andal?
He was a warrior also?</font>

614
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:27,053
He still is.

615
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:29,555
A man of great honor

616
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,515
and I betrayed him.

617
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:38,731
<font color="#ffff00">The Khaleesi wants to eat
something different tonight.</font>

618
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:40,858
<font color="#ffff00">Kill some rabbits.</font>

619
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:43,027
<font color="#ffff00">There are no rabbits.</font>

620
00:47:43,152 --> 00:47:46,864
<font color="#ffff00">Find some ducks, she likes ducks.</font>

621
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:50,451
<font color="#ffff00">Have you seen any ducks, woman?
No rabbits, no ducks.</font>

622
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:52,912
<font color="#ffff00">Do you have eyes in your head? Do you?</font>

623
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:55,122
<font color="#ffff00">Dog then. I have seen many dogs.</font>

624
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:57,583
I don't think she wants to eat dog.

625
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:03,631
The khaleesi have baby inside her.

626
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:08,511
It is true. She does not
bleed for two moons.

627
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:10,971
Her belly start to swell.

628
00:48:12,765 --> 00:48:15,142
<font color="#ffff00">A blessing from the Great Stallion.</font>

629
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:17,269
She does not want to eat horse.

630
00:48:18,354 --> 00:48:21,107
I'll have the boys butcher
a goat for supper.

631
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:28,948
I need to ride to Qohor.

632
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:35,913
Uh, we ride for Vaes Dothrak.

633
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:38,249
Don't worry. I'll catch you.

634
00:48:38,374 --> 00:48:40,751
The horde's easy to find.

635
00:48:52,138 --> 00:48:56,642
Don't stand so still.
It's harder to hit a moving target.

636
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:03,732
Except for you. You move too much.

637
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:06,402
I could just hold my sword out
and let you do the work for me.

638
00:49:11,866 --> 00:49:14,994
How many winters have
you seen, Lord Tyrion?

639
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,329
Eight. No, nine.

640
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:19,874
All of them brief?

641
00:49:19,999 --> 00:49:23,043
They say the winter of my birth was
three years long, Maester Aemon.

642
00:49:23,169 --> 00:49:26,213
This summer has lasted nine.

643
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:30,551
But reports from the citadel
tell us the days grow shorter.

644
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:33,012
The Starks are always right eventually -

645
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:35,556
winter is coming.

646
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:38,517
This one will be long...

647
00:49:39,435 --> 00:49:41,562
and dark things will come with it.

648
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:46,275
We've been capturing wildlings,
more every month.

649
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,735
They're fleeing south.

650
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:51,947
The ones who flee... say they've
seen the white walkers.

651
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:55,326
Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport
say they see mermaids.

652
00:49:55,451 --> 00:49:58,913
One of our own rangers swore
he saw them kill his companions.

653
00:49:59,038 --> 00:50:03,042
He swore it right up to the moment
Ned Stark chopped his head off.

654
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:07,588
The Night's Watch is the only thing
standing between the realm

655
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:10,090
and what lies beyond.

656
00:50:10,216 --> 00:50:15,804
And it has become an army
of undisciplined boys and tired old men.

657
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:18,516
There are less than
a thousand of us now.

658
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:22,353
We can't man the other
castles on the Wall.

659
00:50:22,478 --> 00:50:25,439
We can't properly
patrol the wilderness.

660
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:29,944
We've barely enough resources
to keep our lads armed and fed.

661
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:33,989
Your sister sits by the side of the king.

662
00:50:35,658 --> 00:50:38,327
Tell her... we need help.

663
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:43,249
When winter does come,
gods help us all if we're not ready.

664
00:51:05,938 --> 00:51:07,606
<font color="#ffff00">It's a boy.</font>

665
00:51:12,111 --> 00:51:14,363
<font color="#ffff00">How do you know?</font>

666
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,742
<font color="#ffff00">I know.</font>

667
00:51:50,149 --> 00:51:52,443
I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister.

668
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,280
It's either me or this cold,

669
00:51:56,405 --> 00:51:58,657
and it doesn't appear
to be going anywhere.

670
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:01,535
Will you stop at Winterfell
on your way south?

671
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:02,870
I expect I will.

672
00:52:02,995 --> 00:52:07,124
Gods know there aren't many feather
beds between here and King's Landing.

673
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:09,251
If you see my brother Bran,

674
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:12,004
tell him I miss him.

675
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:14,256
Tell him I'd visit if I could.

676
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:15,633
Of course.

677
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:18,177
He'll never walk again.

678
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:22,097
If you're going to be a cripple,
it's better to be a rich cripple.

679
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:24,600
You take care, Snow.

680
00:52:24,725 --> 00:52:26,560
Farewell, my lord.

681
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:40,866
You are late, boy.

682
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:45,245
Tomorrow you will be here at midday.

683
00:52:45,371 --> 00:52:47,623
Who are you?

684
00:52:48,374 --> 00:52:51,543
Your dancing master, Syrio Forel.

685
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,299
Tomorrow you will catch it.

686
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:59,218
Now pick it up.

687
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:03,972
That is not the way, boy.

688
00:53:04,098 --> 00:53:08,185
It is not a greatsword that is needing
two hands to swing it.

689
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:12,272
- It's too heavy.
- It is heavy as it needs to be

690
00:53:12,398 --> 00:53:14,149
to make you strong.

691
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:16,652
Just so.

692
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:19,071
One hand is all that is needed.

693
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:22,449
Now you are standing all wrong.

694
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:24,910
Turn your body sideface.

695
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:27,287
Yes.

696
00:53:27,413 --> 00:53:29,623
So.

697
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:32,042
You are skinny. That is good.

698
00:53:32,835 --> 00:53:34,962
The target is smaller.

699
00:53:35,087 --> 00:53:37,172
Now the grip - let me see.

700
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,925
Yes.

701
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,678
The grip must be delicate.

702
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:45,597
What if I drop it?

703
00:53:45,723 --> 00:53:48,058
The steel must be part of your arm.

704
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:50,811
Can you drop part of your arm? No.

705
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:54,982
Nine years Syrio Forel was first
sword to the Sealord of Braavos.

706
00:53:55,107 --> 00:53:57,818
He knows these things.
You must listen to me, boy.

707
00:53:57,943 --> 00:53:59,653
I'm a girl.

708
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:05,159
Boy, girl... You are a sword, that is all.

709
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:08,620
That is the grip.

710
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:11,707
You are not holding a battle-axe.
You are holding...

711
00:54:11,832 --> 00:54:13,167
A needle.

712
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:15,919
Ahhh.

713
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:18,464
Just so.

714
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:21,341
Now we will begin the dance.

715
00:54:21,467 --> 00:54:22,885
Remember, child,

716
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:25,846
this is not the dance
of the Westeros we are learning...

717
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:29,767
The knight's dance,
hacking and hammering.

718
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:33,562
This is the Braavos dance...

719
00:54:35,147 --> 00:54:37,024
the water dance.

720
00:54:37,149 --> 00:54:39,318
It is swift...

721
00:54:39,443 --> 00:54:41,612
and sudden.

722
00:54:43,155 --> 00:54:45,324
All men are made of water.

723
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:47,159
Do you know this?

724
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:49,536
If you pierce them,

725
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:53,290
the water leaks out and they die.

726
00:54:54,583 --> 00:54:57,795
Now you will try to strike me.

727
00:55:00,923 --> 00:55:02,674
Ha!

728
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:15,854
Up!

729
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:20,359
Ha!

730
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:32,955
Ah.

731
00:55:35,499 --> 00:55:37,042
Dead.

732
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:38,126
Oh!

733
00:55:38,252 --> 00:55:39,878
Dead.

734
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:41,797
Hup!

735
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:46,426
Very dead.

736
00:55:46,552 --> 00:55:48,345
Come.

737
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:51,098
Ah ah ah!

738
00:55:51,223 --> 00:55:53,976
Hup!

739
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:56,562
Again, faster.

740
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:02,943
Ah.
