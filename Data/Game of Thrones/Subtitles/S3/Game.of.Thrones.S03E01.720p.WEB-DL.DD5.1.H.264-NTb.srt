00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,559
<i>Fall back!</i>

2
00:01:01,342 --> 00:01:03,143
Brother?

3
00:02:25,393 --> 00:02:28,061
Did you send the ravens?

4
00:02:30,331 --> 00:02:34,468
Tarly, look at me.

5
00:02:36,571 --> 00:02:39,139
Did you send the ravens?

6
00:02:42,543 --> 00:02:44,678
<i>That was your job.</i>

7
00:02:44,712 --> 00:02:47,481
Your only job.

8
00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:58,659
We need to get
back to the Wall.

9
00:02:58,693 --> 00:03:01,328
<i>It's a long march.</i>

10
00:03:01,362 --> 00:03:04,097
<i>We know what's out there,</i>

11
00:03:04,165 --> 00:03:07,901
but we have to make it,
have to warn them

12
00:03:07,935 --> 00:03:10,771
or before winter's done,

13
00:03:10,805 --> 00:03:12,973
everyone you've ever known

14
00:03:13,008 --> 00:03:14,808
will be dead.

Valar Dohaeris

17
00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:10,451
First time you've seen
a giant, Jon Snow?

18
00:06:13,422 --> 00:06:16,091
Well, don't stare too long.
They're shy.

19
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:21,730
When they stop being shy,
they get angry.

20
00:06:21,764 --> 00:06:23,899
And when they're angry,

21
00:06:23,933 --> 00:06:27,036
I've seen them pound a man
straight into the ground

22
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,071
like a hammer on a nail.

23
00:06:39,783 --> 00:06:41,383
<i>- Crow!</i>
<i>- Crow!</i>

24
00:06:41,418 --> 00:06:44,520
<i>- Look over there!</i>
<i>- Crow!</i>

25
00:06:44,554 --> 00:06:47,388
<i>Crow! Look over here!
Look!</i>

26
00:06:47,423 --> 00:06:50,558
<i>Ah, look, crow coming!</i>

27
00:06:50,593 --> 00:06:52,294
<i>Crow!</i>

28
00:06:53,863 --> 00:06:56,698
You're wearing
the wrong color.

29
00:06:56,732 --> 00:06:59,234
Mance was a ranger.

30
00:07:01,237 --> 00:07:04,373
In your hearts, all you
crows want to fly free.

31
00:07:04,407 --> 00:07:06,308
When I'm free,
will I be free to go?

32
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:07,343
- Crow!
- Crow!

33
00:07:07,377 --> 00:07:08,678
Sure, you will.

34
00:07:08,712 --> 00:07:11,913
Oh!

35
00:07:11,948 --> 00:07:14,817
And I'll be free to kill you.

36
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:18,453
<i>Got no respect, this lot.</i>

37
00:07:18,488 --> 00:07:21,657
Got no fathers to slap 'em
when they're foul.

38
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,026
What happened to their fathers?

39
00:07:25,562 --> 00:07:28,297
Some of them were killed
by crows like you.

40
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,768
Don't look so grim, Jon Snow.

41
00:07:32,802 --> 00:07:35,838
If Mance Rayder likes you,
you'll live another day.

42
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,741
And if he don't...

43
00:08:01,331 --> 00:08:02,965
I smell a crow.

44
00:08:03,032 --> 00:08:05,200
We killed his friends.

45
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,036
Thought you'd want
to question this one.

46
00:08:08,272 --> 00:08:10,173
What do we want
with a baby crow?

47
00:08:10,207 --> 00:08:13,143
This baby killed
Qhorin Half hand.

48
00:08:13,177 --> 00:08:16,379
<i>He wants to be one of us.</i>

49
00:08:21,886 --> 00:08:25,088
That half-handed cunt
killed friends of mine.

50
00:08:25,122 --> 00:08:27,524
Friends twice your size.

51
00:08:29,427 --> 00:08:33,096
My father told me big men fall
just as quick as little ones

52
00:08:33,131 --> 00:08:36,600
<i>if you put a sword</i>
<i>through their hearts.</i>

53
00:08:36,634 --> 00:08:39,469
Plenty of little men

54
00:08:39,503 --> 00:08:42,439
tried to put their swords
through my heart.

55
00:08:42,473 --> 00:08:45,241
And there's plenty
of little skeletons

56
00:08:45,276 --> 00:08:46,943
<i>buried in the woods.</i>

57
00:08:48,713 --> 00:08:52,015
- <i>What's your name, boy?</i>
- Jon Snow.

58
00:08:57,956 --> 00:09:00,224
Your Grace.

59
00:09:02,527 --> 00:09:04,962
Your Grace?

60
00:09:04,996 --> 00:09:06,664
Did you hear that?

61
00:09:06,698 --> 00:09:09,767
From now on, you'd better
kneel every time I fart.

62
00:09:09,801 --> 00:09:13,203
Stand, boy.

63
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:18,342
We don't kneel for anyone
beyond the Wall.

64
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:26,217
So, you're Ned Stark's bastard.

65
00:09:26,251 --> 00:09:28,385
Thank you for the gift,
Lord of Bones.

66
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:31,089
You can leave us.

67
00:09:39,598 --> 00:09:41,399
The girl likes you.

68
00:09:41,433 --> 00:09:43,601
You like her back, Snow?

69
00:09:43,636 --> 00:09:46,004
That why you want to join us?

70
00:09:46,038 --> 00:09:47,806
<i>Don't panic, boy.</i>

71
00:09:47,841 --> 00:09:50,042
This isn't the damned
Night's Watch

72
00:09:50,077 --> 00:09:52,278
where we make you
swear off girls.

73
00:09:52,312 --> 00:09:55,981
This chicken eater you thought
was king is Tormund Giantsbane.

74
00:09:56,016 --> 00:09:58,451
Can't believe this pup

75
00:09:58,485 --> 00:10:00,786
<i>killed the Half hand.</i>

76
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,021
He was our enemy

77
00:10:03,056 --> 00:10:05,924
and I'm glad he's dead.

78
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,402
He was my brother once.

79
00:10:18,437 --> 00:10:21,105
Back when he had a whole hand.

80
00:10:22,674 --> 00:10:24,642
What were you doing with him?

81
00:10:24,676 --> 00:10:27,979
The Lord Commander sent me
to the Half hand for seasoning.

82
00:10:28,013 --> 00:10:29,847
Why?

83
00:10:29,881 --> 00:10:31,649
He wants me to lead one day.

84
00:10:31,683 --> 00:10:35,153
But here you are, a traitor

85
00:10:35,187 --> 00:10:37,655
kneeling before
the King-beyond-the-Wall.

86
00:10:37,723 --> 00:10:41,259
If I'm a traitor,
then you are, too.

87
00:10:48,534 --> 00:10:51,870
Why do you want
to join us, Jon Snow?

88
00:10:57,843 --> 00:10:59,811
I want to be free.

89
00:10:59,845 --> 00:11:02,981
No, I don't think so.

90
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,184
I think what you want
most of all

91
00:11:06,218 --> 00:11:08,419
is to be a hero.

92
00:11:08,454 --> 00:11:12,357
I'll ask you
one last time--

93
00:11:12,424 --> 00:11:15,426
why do you want to join us?

94
00:11:19,865 --> 00:11:23,467
We stopped at Craster's
Keep on the way north.

95
00:11:24,937 --> 00:11:27,371
I saw...

96
00:11:27,405 --> 00:11:28,972
You saw what?

97
00:11:31,276 --> 00:11:33,343
I saw Craster take
his own baby boy

98
00:11:33,377 --> 00:11:36,112
and leave it in the woods.

99
00:11:36,146 --> 00:11:38,414
I saw what took it.

100
00:11:41,953 --> 00:11:46,056
You're telling me
you saw one of them?

101
00:11:48,894 --> 00:11:51,396
And why would that make you
desert your brothers?

102
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:54,499
Because when I told
the Lord Commander,

103
00:11:54,533 --> 00:11:56,534
he already knew.

104
00:11:58,503 --> 00:12:01,139
Thousands of years ago,
the First Men

105
00:12:01,173 --> 00:12:04,509
battled the White Walkers
and defeated them.

106
00:12:04,543 --> 00:12:08,513
I want to fight for the side
that fights for the living.

107
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,785
Did I come to the right place?

108
00:12:18,557 --> 00:12:21,325
We'll need to find you
a new cloak.

109
00:12:42,448 --> 00:12:44,649
What if you took off
that bit there?

110
00:12:46,786 --> 00:12:50,388
Don't you want to leave
something to the imagination?

111
00:12:50,422 --> 00:12:54,324
Trouble is, I've never
had much imagination.

112
00:12:56,894 --> 00:12:59,496
I want you to take it off.

113
00:13:05,802 --> 00:13:07,670
Mouth.

114
00:13:13,276 --> 00:13:16,444
Ser Bronn. Ser Bronn.

115
00:13:18,347 --> 00:13:20,315
I didn't hear that.

116
00:13:20,349 --> 00:13:22,350
- Apologies, ser.
<i>- Back away.</i>

117
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:25,320
Keep backing away till you're
outside this establishment.

118
00:13:25,354 --> 00:13:28,990
- Then back away some more.
- Lord Tyrion sent me.

119
00:13:29,024 --> 00:13:31,993
I will murder you, boy.

120
00:13:32,027 --> 00:13:34,495
He said it was a matter
of life and death.

121
00:13:51,344 --> 00:13:54,513
- Pod?
<i>- It's your sister.</i>

122
00:13:55,783 --> 00:13:58,118
<i>The queen.</i>

123
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:12,167
<i>What are they doing here?</i>

124
00:14:12,201 --> 00:14:15,370
Protecting me, I assume.
Will you let me in?

125
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:18,239
No, I don't think so.

126
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,975
If I wanted to kill you,
do you think

127
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:22,677
I'd let a wooden door stop me?

128
00:14:28,684 --> 00:14:30,185
They stay outside.

129
00:14:30,219 --> 00:14:32,454
I'm not afraid of you,
little brother.

130
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,872
- Why are you here?
- I wanted to see your face.

131
00:14:50,907 --> 00:14:54,477
They said you'd lost your nose, but
it's not as gruesome as all that.

132
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:57,947
The man who cut me
lost more than his nose.

133
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:00,350
I should hope so.

134
00:15:00,384 --> 00:15:03,686
The rebels came for Joffrey's
head, they lost their own.

135
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,788
Thanks to Father.

136
00:15:05,823 --> 00:15:08,291
Thanks to Father.

137
00:15:09,793 --> 00:15:11,895
Of course, it wasn't a rebel
who tried to kill me.

138
00:15:11,929 --> 00:15:14,464
No? Curious.

139
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:18,301
Bit of a comedown
from chamber of the Hand.

140
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:20,537
But then I don't suppose
you need much room.

141
00:15:20,572 --> 00:15:23,540
Grand Maester Pycelle
made the same joke.

142
00:15:23,574 --> 00:15:26,877
You must be proud to be as funny as
a man whose balls brush his knees.

143
00:15:26,911 --> 00:15:28,678
You're meeting Father today?

144
00:15:28,713 --> 00:15:30,781
How do you know that?

145
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:33,651
<i>Because I have hundreds</i>
<i>of spies in my employ.</i>

146
00:15:33,685 --> 00:15:37,187
The Master of Whisperers
owes me a favor or two.

147
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:41,825
Father told me.
What do you want from him?

148
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,493
What do I want from him?
He's my father.

149
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:46,029
Do I need to want something?

150
00:15:48,598 --> 00:15:50,699
I'm sure he loves me dearly,

151
00:15:50,734 --> 00:15:52,434
as any father loves his child,

152
00:15:52,469 --> 00:15:55,137
his baby boy.

153
00:15:55,171 --> 00:15:57,239
Yet he hasn't come
to visit once

154
00:15:57,306 --> 00:15:58,907
<i>since arriving</i>
<i>in King's Landing.</i>

155
00:15:58,941 --> 00:16:02,043
<i>I lay here,</i>
<i>my face split in half,</i>

156
00:16:02,111 --> 00:16:04,613
but Father never came.

157
00:16:09,752 --> 00:16:12,186
You're going to make me cry.

158
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,588
Why do you care
what I want from him?

159
00:16:16,057 --> 00:16:18,092
Because you've slandered me
to Father before.

160
00:16:18,126 --> 00:16:20,360
Slandered?
When?

161
00:16:20,394 --> 00:16:22,629
<i>You told him I had my guards</i>

162
00:16:22,663 --> 00:16:24,530
beat that servant girl
at Casterly Rock.

163
00:16:24,565 --> 00:16:26,399
<i>You did have</i>
<i>your guards beat her.</i>

164
00:16:26,433 --> 00:16:27,667
A girl of nine, I believe.

165
00:16:27,701 --> 00:16:29,502
<i>I was nine, too.</i>

166
00:16:29,536 --> 00:16:31,570
She lost an eye,
if I remember correctly.

167
00:16:31,605 --> 00:16:33,005
If I remember correctly,

168
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:35,274
she never stole
a necklace again.

169
00:16:36,977 --> 00:16:39,879
It's not slander if it's true.

170
00:16:39,913 --> 00:16:42,615
And what's this truth
you plan on telling him today?

171
00:16:42,649 --> 00:16:44,383
<i>Why are you so nervous</i>

172
00:16:44,417 --> 00:16:46,652
<i>about what I'm going</i>
<i>to say to Father?</i>

173
00:16:46,686 --> 00:16:48,754
Because you're a liar.

174
00:16:48,789 --> 00:16:51,858
I expect you'll tell lies
about me, about Joffrey.

175
00:16:51,892 --> 00:16:54,361
Any lies in particular?

176
00:16:56,097 --> 00:16:58,532
You're a clever man,

177
00:16:58,567 --> 00:17:00,835
but you're not half as clever
as you think you are.

178
00:17:00,869 --> 00:17:03,905
Still makes me
more clever than you.

179
00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:10,712
Oh, look at these two
shining warriors.

180
00:17:10,746 --> 00:17:14,215
Ser Taryn Mant and...

181
00:17:14,249 --> 00:17:15,984
Ser Whosit of Whocares.

182
00:17:16,018 --> 00:17:17,385
Ser Meryn Trant.

183
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,955
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

184
00:17:19,989 --> 00:17:22,591
- You're no knight.
- Pod.

185
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,059
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater

186
00:17:24,093 --> 00:17:25,994
was anointed
by the king himself.

187
00:17:26,062 --> 00:17:28,730
You're an up-jumped
cutthroat,

188
00:17:28,765 --> 00:17:30,366
nothing more.

189
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,335
That's exactly who I am.

190
00:17:32,369 --> 00:17:34,136
And you're a grub
in fancy armor

191
00:17:34,171 --> 00:17:37,440
<i>who's better at beating little
girls than fighting men.</i>

192
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:40,243
Now, I have an appointment
with Lord Tyrion.

193
00:17:40,278 --> 00:17:43,113
You put your hand on that door,

194
00:17:43,148 --> 00:17:45,749
you lose the hand.

195
00:18:01,566 --> 00:18:04,267
As much as I appreciate a walk
in the sunshine, your lordship,

196
00:18:04,302 --> 00:18:06,436
I am wondering
why you sent for me.

197
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,571
A number of people
in this city want to kill me.

198
00:18:08,605 --> 00:18:09,905
You're here to protect me.

199
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,141
I've been doing that
for a while now.

200
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:13,943
Do you grow bored
protecting me?

201
00:18:13,977 --> 00:18:15,444
I grow poor protecting you.

202
00:18:15,478 --> 00:18:17,379
Poor?
Poor?

203
00:18:17,447 --> 00:18:19,481
Under my patronage
you've become a knight,

204
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:21,583
you've served as Commander
of the City Watch.

205
00:18:21,618 --> 00:18:24,353
- Briefly.
- I'm sure you filled your pockets.

206
00:18:24,387 --> 00:18:26,455
And now my pockets are empty.

207
00:18:26,489 --> 00:18:28,824
You've given me a taste
for the finer things.

208
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:30,860
And if you want me
to carry on protecting you,

209
00:18:30,894 --> 00:18:32,228
you'll need to pay more.

210
00:18:32,262 --> 00:18:34,730
- I thought we were friends.
- We are.

211
00:18:34,764 --> 00:18:37,533
But I'm a sellsword.
I sell my sword.

212
00:18:37,567 --> 00:18:39,334
I don't loan it out
to friends as a favor.

213
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:40,802
- How much?
- Double.

214
00:18:40,837 --> 00:18:43,004
- Double?
- I'm a knight now.

215
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,472
Knights are worth double.

216
00:18:44,507 --> 00:18:46,875
I don't even know how much
I'm paying you now.

217
00:18:46,909 --> 00:18:48,977
Which means you can afford it.

218
00:19:27,014 --> 00:19:29,549
Here. Here!

219
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,361
Help me!

220
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,320
Who are you?

221
00:20:06,857 --> 00:20:11,061
I was in the battle
at Blackwater.

222
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:16,100
I was a captain and a knight.

223
00:20:16,134 --> 00:20:20,004
Aye, ser,
and serving which king?

224
00:20:25,578 --> 00:20:28,347
The one true king
of Westeros--

225
00:20:30,984 --> 00:20:33,051
Stannis Baratheon.

226
00:20:42,594 --> 00:20:44,228
I thought you were dead.

227
00:20:44,263 --> 00:20:46,897
Everyone thought you were dead.

228
00:20:51,202 --> 00:20:52,469
And your son?

229
00:20:58,242 --> 00:21:00,644
He may have swam
ashore as you did.

230
00:21:00,678 --> 00:21:03,714
No, the wildfire took him.
I saw it.

231
00:21:13,224 --> 00:21:16,459
I'm so sorry, my friend.

232
00:21:16,494 --> 00:21:19,029
I, too, have lost a son.

233
00:21:19,063 --> 00:21:21,431
There is nothing worse
in this world.

234
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,335
But, Davos, you were
a good father.

235
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:29,905
If I was a good father,
he'd still be here.

236
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,509
Stannis lives?

237
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,745
He licks his wounds
at Dragonstone.

238
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:38,546
Will you take me there?

239
00:21:38,581 --> 00:21:40,982
There is nothing for me
at Dragonstone.

240
00:21:41,017 --> 00:21:42,483
This war is not over.

241
00:21:42,518 --> 00:21:43,851
Not for you, maybe.

242
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:46,621
But for Salladhor Saan,
the war is over.

243
00:21:46,655 --> 00:21:48,656
We're both sworn
to King Stannis.

244
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:51,159
I am sworn to no man.

245
00:21:51,193 --> 00:21:54,996
I promised you 30 ships and you
promised me riches and glory.

246
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,531
I delivered the ships.

247
00:21:56,566 --> 00:21:58,734
Stannis never gives up.
Never.

248
00:21:58,768 --> 00:22:01,170
- Now he will regroup--
- <i>He's a broken man.</i>

249
00:22:01,204 --> 00:22:03,673
His fleet lies at the bottom
of Blackwater Bay.

250
00:22:03,707 --> 00:22:05,342
They say he sees no one--

251
00:22:05,376 --> 00:22:07,611
not his generals,
not even his wife.

252
00:22:07,645 --> 00:22:10,648
Only the Red Woman

253
00:22:10,682 --> 00:22:12,049
whispering in his ear,

254
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:14,918
telling him what
she sees in the flames

255
00:22:14,953 --> 00:22:16,587
and burning men alive.

256
00:22:16,621 --> 00:22:18,055
What?

257
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:21,592
They built a great fire
when Stannis returned.

258
00:22:21,626 --> 00:22:24,528
All those who spoke
against her she called

259
00:22:24,562 --> 00:22:27,164
servants of darkness.

260
00:22:29,133 --> 00:22:31,668
They say she sang
to them as they burned.

261
00:22:36,474 --> 00:22:37,975
I'm a pirate.

262
00:22:38,009 --> 00:22:40,310
<i>You're a smuggler.</i>

263
00:22:40,345 --> 00:22:42,012
<i>Servants of darkness.</i>

264
00:22:42,046 --> 00:22:45,315
I'm thinking Dragonstone is a
good place for us to avoid.

265
00:22:45,349 --> 00:22:47,616
Take me back there, please.

266
00:22:47,651 --> 00:22:49,551
You cannot turn
Stannis against her.

267
00:22:49,586 --> 00:22:52,220
Maybe not, but I could
carve her heart out.

268
00:22:52,255 --> 00:22:53,855
You could try.

269
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:56,258
If you fail,
they will burn you.

270
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:59,161
If you succeed,
they'll burn you.

271
00:22:59,195 --> 00:23:01,330
And you've only
just come back to life.

272
00:23:01,364 --> 00:23:03,599
Stay alive a little
longer, my friend.

273
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:06,368
You call me friend. You drank
with me on my wedding day.

274
00:23:06,402 --> 00:23:08,870
And you drank with me
on four of my wedding days,

275
00:23:08,905 --> 00:23:10,806
but I don't ask you for favors.

276
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,441
I have to stop her.

277
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:15,611
Please, do this for me.

278
00:23:18,449 --> 00:23:20,817
When you are dead,

279
00:23:20,851 --> 00:23:23,286
I will gather your bones
in a little sack

280
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,423
and let your widow
wear them around her neck.

281
00:23:39,371 --> 00:23:42,639
We should set the siege lines
1,000 yards from Harrenhal.

282
00:23:42,673 --> 00:23:45,442
There won't be a siege. The
Mountain can't defend a ruin.

283
00:23:45,476 --> 00:23:46,977
I imagine the Mountain
will defend

284
00:23:47,011 --> 00:23:48,878
whatever Tywin Lannister
tells him to defend.

285
00:23:48,913 --> 00:23:51,081
The Lannisters have been
running from us since Oxcross.

286
00:23:51,115 --> 00:23:53,817
I'd love a fight.
The men would love a fight.

287
00:23:53,852 --> 00:23:56,654
I don't think
we're going to get one.

288
00:24:44,605 --> 00:24:48,975
200 Northmen
slaughtered like sheep.

289
00:24:49,043 --> 00:24:52,046
The debt will be
repaid, my friend.

290
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,882
For them and for your sons.

291
00:24:54,916 --> 00:24:57,084
Will it?

292
00:24:57,151 --> 00:24:59,452
They rot in the ground

293
00:24:59,486 --> 00:25:01,688
<i>while their killer runs free.</i>

294
00:25:01,722 --> 00:25:04,657
The Kingslayer won't
remain free for long.

295
00:25:04,692 --> 00:25:07,527
My best hunters are after him.

296
00:25:26,213 --> 00:25:30,183
<i>- A Mallister?</i>
- Ser Jeremy.

297
00:25:30,217 --> 00:25:32,752
My father's bannerman.

298
00:25:53,041 --> 00:25:55,976
Find her a chamber
that will serve as a cell.

299
00:26:08,322 --> 00:26:09,690
<i>She's your mother.</i>

300
00:26:09,724 --> 00:26:12,359
She freed Jaime Lannister.

301
00:26:12,394 --> 00:26:14,762
The Lannisters robbed
them of their sons

302
00:26:14,796 --> 00:26:16,564
and she robbed them
of their justice.

303
00:26:18,633 --> 00:26:19,867
<i>Water.</i>

304
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,704
Water.

305
00:26:23,739 --> 00:26:25,973
This needs to be
cleaned and closed.

306
00:26:30,546 --> 00:26:32,715
What's your name, friend?

307
00:26:32,749 --> 00:26:34,616
Qyburn.

308
00:26:34,651 --> 00:26:36,018
You're lucky to be alive.

309
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:41,757
Lucky?

310
00:27:07,654 --> 00:27:09,722
The badge looks good on you.

311
00:27:11,558 --> 00:27:14,193
Almost as good
as it looked on me.

312
00:27:16,462 --> 00:27:19,565
Are you enjoying
your new position?

313
00:27:21,234 --> 00:27:22,735
Am I enjoying it?

314
00:27:22,769 --> 00:27:25,171
I was very happy
as Hand of the King.

315
00:27:25,205 --> 00:27:27,239
Yes.

316
00:27:27,273 --> 00:27:29,241
I heard how happy you were.

317
00:27:31,177 --> 00:27:33,745
You brought a whore
into my bed.

318
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:36,381
It wasn't your bed at the time.

319
00:27:38,818 --> 00:27:41,753
I sent you here
to advise the king.

320
00:27:41,787 --> 00:27:45,823
I gave you real power
and authority.

321
00:27:45,857 --> 00:27:48,192
You chose to spend your days

322
00:27:48,226 --> 00:27:50,394
as you always have,

323
00:27:50,428 --> 00:27:52,863
bedding harlots

324
00:27:52,897 --> 00:27:55,265
and drinking with thieves.

325
00:27:56,993 --> 00:27:59,795
Occasionally I drank
with the harlots.

326
00:27:59,829 --> 00:28:01,631
What do you want, Tyrion?

327
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,681
Why does everyone assume
I want something?

328
00:28:04,715 --> 00:28:07,617
Can't I simply visit
with my beloved father?

329
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:11,254
My beloved father who

330
00:28:11,288 --> 00:28:14,385
somehow forgot to visit
his wounded son

331
00:28:14,505 --> 00:28:15,858
after he fell
on the battlefield.

332
00:28:15,893 --> 00:28:19,462
Maester Pycelle assured me
your wounds were not fatal.

333
00:28:19,496 --> 00:28:22,498
I organized
the defense of this city

334
00:28:22,532 --> 00:28:25,701
while you held court
in the ruins of Harrenhal.

335
00:28:25,735 --> 00:28:28,469
I led the foray when the
enemies were at the gate

336
00:28:28,504 --> 00:28:30,772
while your grandson, the king,

337
00:28:30,806 --> 00:28:33,441
quivered in fear
behind the walls.

338
00:28:33,475 --> 00:28:37,078
I bled in the mud
for our family.

339
00:28:38,047 --> 00:28:39,581
And as my reward,

340
00:28:39,615 --> 00:28:42,951
I was trundled off
to some dark little cell.

341
00:28:42,985 --> 00:28:44,986
But what do I want?

342
00:28:46,322 --> 00:28:48,456
A little bloody gratitude
would be a start.

343
00:28:48,491 --> 00:28:51,726
Jugglers and singers
require applause.

344
00:28:51,761 --> 00:28:54,196
You are a Lannister.

345
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:57,265
<i>Do you think I demanded</i>
<i>a garland of roses</i>

346
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:00,002
<i>every time I suffered</i>
<i>a wound on a battlefield?</i>

347
00:29:00,036 --> 00:29:02,003
Hmm?

348
00:29:02,071 --> 00:29:05,840
Now, I have seven kingdoms
to look after

349
00:29:05,908 --> 00:29:08,242
and three of them
are in open rebellion.

350
00:29:08,277 --> 00:29:13,047
So tell me what you want.

351
00:29:16,953 --> 00:29:19,755
I want what is mine by right.

352
00:29:21,458 --> 00:29:24,794
Jaime is your eldest son,
heir to your lands and titles.

353
00:29:24,862 --> 00:29:29,133
But he is a Kingsguard, forbidden
from marriage or inheritance.

354
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:31,202
The day Jaime put on
the white cloak,

355
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:35,005
he gave up his claim
to Casterly Rock.

356
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,408
I am your son and lawful heir.

357
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:43,013
You want Casterly Rock?

358
00:29:43,048 --> 00:29:45,015
It is mine by right.

359
00:29:49,588 --> 00:29:51,689
We'll find you accommodations

360
00:29:51,724 --> 00:29:53,625
more suited to your name

361
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:56,027
<i>and as a reward</i>
<i>for your accomplishments</i>

362
00:29:56,061 --> 00:29:58,930
during the battle
of Blackwater Bay.

363
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:02,634
And when the time is right,
you will be given a position

364
00:30:02,668 --> 00:30:04,335
<i>fit for your talents</i>

365
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:06,905
so that you can
serve your family

366
00:30:06,939 --> 00:30:09,040
and protect our legacy.

367
00:30:09,075 --> 00:30:10,709
<i>And if you serve faithfully,</i>

368
00:30:10,743 --> 00:30:13,278
<i>you will be rewarded</i>
<i>with a suitable wife.</i>

369
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:17,148
And I would let myself
be consumed by maggots

370
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:18,450
<i>before mocking the family name</i>

371
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:21,420
<i>and making you</i>
<i>heir to Casterly Rock.</i>

372
00:30:23,022 --> 00:30:25,823
- Why?
- Why?

373
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:27,992
You ask that?

374
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:31,428
You, who killed your mother
to come into the world?

375
00:30:31,463 --> 00:30:35,599
You are an ill-made,
spiteful little creature

376
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:39,637
full of envy, lust,
and low cunning.

377
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,239
<i>Men's laws give you</i>
<i>the right to bear my name</i>

378
00:30:42,274 --> 00:30:46,877
and display my colors since I
cannot prove that you are not mine.

379
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,948
<i>And to teach me humility,</i>
<i>the gods have condemned me</i>

380
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:54,384
to watch you waddle about
wearing that proud lion

381
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:58,322
that was my father's sigil
and his father's before him.

382
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:00,057
But neither gods nor men

383
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:02,993
will ever compel me
to let you turn Casterly Rock

384
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:06,129
<i>into your whorehouse.</i>

385
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:09,032
Go, now.

386
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:15,939
Speak no more of your rights
to Casterly Rock.

387
00:31:17,941 --> 00:31:20,143
Go.

388
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:31,253
Oh, one more thing.

389
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:36,792
The next whore I catch
in your bed I'll hang.

390
00:31:44,835 --> 00:31:47,638
<i>Dorne.</i>
<i>It's going to Dorne.</i>

391
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:50,574
<i>- Why Dorne?</i>
- It's carrying silk

392
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:54,078
and it's supposed to bring
back wine in exchange.

393
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:00,450
But it's not coming back.

394
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:03,086
The captain's tired
of risking his life

395
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:05,289
so King's Landing
lords and ladies

396
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:08,392
can get drunk on better
wine than they deserve.

397
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,963
He's going to stay in Dorne.

398
00:32:11,997 --> 00:32:15,333
Wait out the winter where
it's beautiful and warm.

399
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:19,137
I met some people in Dorne who
weren't so beautiful and warm.

400
00:32:19,172 --> 00:32:21,140
Don't ruin the game.

401
00:32:21,174 --> 00:32:23,910
I told you,
I don't want to play.

402
00:32:25,012 --> 00:32:27,046
What about that one there?

403
00:32:27,081 --> 00:32:28,548
That one?

404
00:32:28,582 --> 00:32:30,584
It's going to Volantis.

405
00:32:30,618 --> 00:32:32,052
Why?

406
00:32:32,086 --> 00:32:33,787
Because when I got
on a ship in Volantis,

407
00:32:33,821 --> 00:32:36,356
it looked like that one.

408
00:32:36,391 --> 00:32:38,192
That's not how the game works.

409
00:32:38,226 --> 00:32:41,796
You're not supposed to just
blurt out the right answer.

410
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,430
You've got to invent a story

411
00:32:43,465 --> 00:32:46,900
about where the ship
is going and why.

412
00:32:46,935 --> 00:32:49,804
Why should I make up a story
when I know the truth?

413
00:32:49,838 --> 00:32:51,872
Because the truth

414
00:32:51,907 --> 00:32:54,442
is always either
terrible or boring.

415
00:32:54,476 --> 00:32:57,245
Lovely day for it.

416
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,181
Watching the ships.

417
00:32:59,215 --> 00:33:02,184
Lord Baelish.

418
00:33:02,219 --> 00:33:05,254
Might I speak with Lady Sansa

419
00:33:05,289 --> 00:33:06,923
alone for a moment?

420
00:33:18,402 --> 00:33:21,270
I saw your mother not long ago.

421
00:33:22,672 --> 00:33:24,973
She's very eager to see you.

422
00:33:26,743 --> 00:33:30,044
And your sister.

423
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:32,681
Arya's alive?

424
00:33:35,985 --> 00:33:37,852
You said you'd take me home.

425
00:33:37,886 --> 00:33:41,255
You said King's Landing
was your home.

426
00:33:42,457 --> 00:33:43,824
You are the property
of the crown.

427
00:33:43,858 --> 00:33:45,225
Stealing you would be treason.

428
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,494
If you were to tell
just one person--

429
00:33:47,529 --> 00:33:49,530
- I won't tell anyone.
- How do I know?

430
00:33:49,564 --> 00:33:51,498
Because I'm a terrible liar.

431
00:33:51,532 --> 00:33:54,167
You said so yourself.

432
00:33:54,201 --> 00:33:57,370
Please, Lord Baelish.
Tell me what to do. Tell me when.

433
00:34:00,607 --> 00:34:02,141
I'm waiting for word
on an assignment

434
00:34:02,175 --> 00:34:05,377
that will take me far away
from the capital.

435
00:34:05,445 --> 00:34:07,112
When I set sail,

436
00:34:07,146 --> 00:34:09,681
I might be able
to take you with me.

437
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:12,717
But you'll need to be ready to
leave on a moment's notice.

438
00:34:15,154 --> 00:34:17,422
You're her handmaiden?

439
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:22,294
Yes.
And you're his...?

440
00:34:22,328 --> 00:34:25,798
I help manage his affairs.

441
00:34:25,832 --> 00:34:29,235
- He's an important person.
- So is she.

442
00:34:29,269 --> 00:34:31,803
I grew up in the shadow
of her father's castle.

443
00:34:31,838 --> 00:34:33,839
The day she was born,
they rang the bells

444
00:34:33,873 --> 00:34:36,275
from sunrise till sunset.

445
00:34:38,645 --> 00:34:41,280
We've both done
rather well, you and I.

446
00:34:43,851 --> 00:34:45,618
Yes.

447
00:34:45,652 --> 00:34:48,888
Given where we started.

448
00:34:48,922 --> 00:34:51,157
And where is that?

449
00:34:52,626 --> 00:34:54,693
It's not easy for girls like us

450
00:34:54,728 --> 00:34:56,896
to dig our way out.

451
00:35:01,668 --> 00:35:04,269
<i>Watch out for her.</i>

452
00:35:04,304 --> 00:35:07,138
I always do.

453
00:35:07,173 --> 00:35:09,874
Watch out for her with him.

454
00:36:02,163 --> 00:36:04,265
They're growing fast.

455
00:36:07,469 --> 00:36:09,002
Not fast enough.

456
00:36:10,171 --> 00:36:12,440
I can't wait that long.

457
00:36:15,677 --> 00:36:17,312
I need an army.

458
00:36:18,681 --> 00:36:21,115
We'll be in Astapor
by nightfall.

459
00:36:23,018 --> 00:36:25,186
Some say the Unsullied are the
greatest soldiers in the world.

460
00:36:25,221 --> 00:36:28,023
The greatest slave-soldiers
in the world.

461
00:36:28,057 --> 00:36:30,359
The distinction means
a good deal to some people.

462
00:36:30,393 --> 00:36:32,227
Do those people
have any better ideas

463
00:36:32,261 --> 00:36:35,530
about how to put you
on the Iron Throne?

464
00:36:37,232 --> 00:36:39,067
It's too beautiful
a day to argue.

465
00:36:42,671 --> 00:36:44,405
You're right.

466
00:36:47,108 --> 00:36:49,610
Another lovely day
on the high seas.

467
00:36:49,644 --> 00:36:51,411
<i>Don't mock them.</i>

468
00:36:51,446 --> 00:36:53,814
They're the first Dothraki
who have ever been on a ship.

469
00:36:53,881 --> 00:36:56,216
They followed me
across the poison water.

470
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,551
If they'll do it, others will.

471
00:36:57,585 --> 00:36:59,118
And with a true
khalasar--

472
00:36:59,153 --> 00:37:03,256
The Dothraki follow strength
above all, khaleesi.

473
00:37:03,291 --> 00:37:07,059
You'll have a true khalasar
when you prove yourself strong.

474
00:37:07,094 --> 00:37:09,295
And not before.

475
00:37:36,556 --> 00:37:38,123
Your Grace.

476
00:37:49,136 --> 00:37:51,705
I heard you were dead.

477
00:37:51,739 --> 00:37:53,607
Not yet.

478
00:37:55,743 --> 00:37:58,612
I had hoped to speak
to you alone, Your Grace.

479
00:37:59,681 --> 00:38:01,682
We are alone.

480
00:38:11,694 --> 00:38:14,863
Your Grace, you are
the rightful king.

481
00:38:14,897 --> 00:38:17,766
<i>Not only by blood.</i>

482
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,769
You're an honorable man,
a just man.

483
00:38:20,803 --> 00:38:23,105
And there is still
a war to fight.

484
00:38:23,139 --> 00:38:25,840
I am fighting.

485
00:38:25,875 --> 00:38:28,510
By burning prisoners alive?

486
00:38:30,814 --> 00:38:32,581
How would you punish
the infidels, Ser Davos?

487
00:38:32,616 --> 00:38:35,051
I do not judge people
for the gods they worship.

488
00:38:35,085 --> 00:38:37,186
If I did, I'd have
thrown you in the sea

489
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,955
before you ever set foot
on Dragonstone.

490
00:38:40,056 --> 00:38:42,691
- I'm not your enemy.
- You are my enemy.

491
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:49,031
Was it me you fought
on Blackwater Bay?

492
00:38:50,334 --> 00:38:52,835
<i>Did I set your ships ablaze?</i>

493
00:38:56,340 --> 00:39:00,477
I wasn't there when the wildfire
killed our men by the thousands.

494
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,149
I could have saved those men.

495
00:39:05,183 --> 00:39:06,817
You would have taken the city,

496
00:39:06,885 --> 00:39:08,726
Stannis would now sit
upon his rightful throne,

497
00:39:08,754 --> 00:39:10,422
and you would stand beside him.

498
00:39:10,456 --> 00:39:12,991
<i>But I wasn't there</i>

499
00:39:13,025 --> 00:39:16,695
because you convinced
your king to leave me behind.

500
00:39:24,871 --> 00:39:27,906
Do you hear them screaming?

501
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:31,243
All those burning men
in the water

502
00:39:31,277 --> 00:39:33,945
crying for their mothers,

503
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:36,848
for their gods for help?

504
00:39:36,882 --> 00:39:39,617
Until the moment
the Blackwater swallowed them.

505
00:39:46,491 --> 00:39:48,892
Don't despair, Ser Davos.

506
00:39:48,926 --> 00:39:51,294
What I told your son is true.

507
00:39:51,328 --> 00:39:53,696
Death by fire

508
00:39:53,731 --> 00:39:55,432
is the purest death.

509
00:39:57,335 --> 00:39:59,569
This woman is evil!

510
00:39:59,637 --> 00:40:01,271
She's the mother of demons.

511
00:40:01,305 --> 00:40:04,140
Take him to the dungeon
and lock him in a cell.

512
00:40:04,175 --> 00:40:05,675
- Your Grace!
- Come on.

513
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:06,977
You've chosen
the darkness, Ser Davos.

514
00:40:07,011 --> 00:40:09,879
- She will destroy us all!
- I will pray for you.

515
00:40:09,947 --> 00:40:11,915
<i>Your Grace!</i>

516
00:40:39,376 --> 00:40:41,978
<i>Halt. Down.</i>

517
00:40:43,147 --> 00:40:46,049
<i>Halt. Down.</i>

518
00:40:52,157 --> 00:40:53,524
Why have we stopped?

519
00:40:53,558 --> 00:40:55,092
It's Lady Margaery, Your Grace.

520
00:41:00,398 --> 00:41:02,266
<i>What is she doing?
Who gave her permission?</i>

521
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:06,203
My lady. We should
have guards, my lady.

522
00:41:06,238 --> 00:41:08,606
Why?

523
00:41:11,744 --> 00:41:13,511
Pardon me.

524
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,956
Stop, my lady.
You'll ruin your dress.

525
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:25,791
I have others.

526
00:41:31,598 --> 00:41:33,999
Would you like to speak
with her, Your Grace?

527
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:38,971
No.

528
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:40,739
He was a soldier.

529
00:41:41,274 --> 00:41:43,174
He went to fight on the walls

530
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:45,777
when the ships came
into Blackwater Bay.

531
00:41:45,811 --> 00:41:47,879
He never came back.

532
00:41:47,913 --> 00:41:49,714
And your mother?

533
00:41:49,748 --> 00:41:52,149
She died when she had me.

534
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,988
Bad men wanted
to come into this city

535
00:41:57,022 --> 00:42:00,691
and do terrible things,
but your father stopped them.

536
00:42:06,698 --> 00:42:08,700
Whenever you look
at this knight,

537
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:11,569
I want you to remember
your father.

538
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:16,039
He wasn't a knight.

539
00:42:16,074 --> 00:42:18,008
He was just a soldier.

540
00:42:18,042 --> 00:42:20,410
And what do knights
swear to do?

541
00:42:20,444 --> 00:42:23,779
Protect the weak
and uphold the good.

542
00:42:23,814 --> 00:42:27,549
Your father did that.
Be proud of him.

543
00:42:30,286 --> 00:42:33,455
Was your father a soldier, too?

544
00:42:34,523 --> 00:42:37,392
You should be proud, too.

545
00:42:39,262 --> 00:42:41,563
Under King Joffrey's
leadership,

546
00:42:41,597 --> 00:42:44,332
your fathers saved the city.

547
00:42:44,367 --> 00:42:46,668
They saved us all.

548
00:42:46,702 --> 00:42:50,072
From now on, we're going
to take care of you.

549
00:42:52,475 --> 00:42:54,509
All of you.

550
00:43:01,316 --> 00:43:03,317
Come to me for whatever
you need to feed them,

551
00:43:03,352 --> 00:43:05,419
clothe them, or house them.

552
00:43:07,222 --> 00:43:09,322
Directly to me.

553
00:43:24,071 --> 00:43:26,239
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

554
00:43:26,274 --> 00:43:27,874
Please, sit.
Sit.

555
00:43:27,909 --> 00:43:30,377
I do apologize, my lady.

556
00:43:30,411 --> 00:43:32,747
Small council meetings.

557
00:43:32,781 --> 00:43:34,882
At what point
does it become treason

558
00:43:34,916 --> 00:43:36,784
to waste the king's time?

559
00:43:41,491 --> 00:43:43,225
That's a lovely gown, my lady.

560
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:45,261
Yes, it suits you perfectly.

561
00:43:45,295 --> 00:43:47,697
I imagine you might
be rather cold.

562
00:43:47,731 --> 00:43:51,101
The climate is a bit more forgiving
back in Highgarden, Your Grace.

563
00:43:51,135 --> 00:43:54,837
Shall I have them bring
you a shawl, my lady?

564
00:43:54,872 --> 00:43:57,340
I am touched by your
concern, Your Grace.

565
00:43:57,375 --> 00:44:00,577
Luckily for us Tyrells,
our blood runs quite warm.

566
00:44:00,611 --> 00:44:02,579
- <i>Doesn't it, Loras?</i>
- Yes.

567
00:44:02,613 --> 00:44:05,716
Loras, isn't the queen's
gown magnificent?

568
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:08,618
The fabric, the embroidery,
the metalwork.

569
00:44:08,653 --> 00:44:10,287
I've never seen
anything like it.

570
00:44:10,321 --> 00:44:12,222
You might find a bit
of armor quite useful

571
00:44:12,256 --> 00:44:14,858
once you become queen.
Perhaps before.

572
00:44:14,892 --> 00:44:18,695
<i>Joffrey tells me you stopped
your carriage at Flea Bottom</i>

573
00:44:18,729 --> 00:44:20,497
on your way back from
the sept this morning.

574
00:44:20,531 --> 00:44:24,901
Yes. I paid a visit
to an orphanage

575
00:44:24,935 --> 00:44:26,469
the High Septon told me about.

576
00:44:26,503 --> 00:44:29,172
Margaery does a great deal of work
with the poor back in Highgarden.

577
00:44:29,206 --> 00:44:33,510
The lowest among us are no different from
the highest if you give them a chance

578
00:44:33,544 --> 00:44:35,813
and approach them
with an open heart.

579
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,915
<i>An open heart is what
you'll get in Flea Bottom</i>

580
00:44:37,949 --> 00:44:39,516
<i>if you're not careful, my dear.</i>

581
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:43,386
Not long ago, we were
attacked by a mob there.

582
00:44:43,454 --> 00:44:46,356
We had a full complement
of guards that didn't stop them.

583
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:49,359
The king barely escaped
with his life.

584
00:44:49,393 --> 00:44:52,863
My mother's always had
a penchant for drama.

585
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:55,466
Facts become less and less
important to her

586
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,501
<i>as she grows older.</i>

587
00:44:57,569 --> 00:45:00,471
Our lives were never
truly in danger.

588
00:45:01,706 --> 00:45:03,440
You're right, of course.

589
00:45:03,475 --> 00:45:06,710
But you are your father's son.

590
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:08,912
We can't all have
a king's bravery.

591
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:19,290
Hunger turns men into beasts.

592
00:45:19,324 --> 00:45:23,161
I'm glad House Tyrell has been
able to help in this regard.

593
00:45:23,196 --> 00:45:27,032
They tell me 100 wagons arrive
daily now from the Reach.

594
00:45:27,067 --> 00:45:30,569
<i>Wheat, barley, apples.</i>
<i>We've had a blessed harvest.</i>

595
00:45:30,604 --> 00:45:33,272
And, of course, it's our
duty to assist the capital

596
00:45:33,306 --> 00:45:35,341
in time of need.

597
00:45:35,375 --> 00:45:37,076
Well, as Ser Loras said,

598
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:40,246
Lady Margaery has done
this sort of...

599
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,966
charitable work before.

600
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:45,384
I'm sure she knows
what she's doing.

601
00:45:46,753 --> 00:45:48,788
I'm sure she does.

602
00:46:17,221 --> 00:46:20,023
The Unsullied have stood here
for a day and a night

603
00:46:20,058 --> 00:46:22,193
with no food or water.

604
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:30,702
They will stand
until they drop.

605
00:46:32,811 --> 00:46:34,939
Such is their obedience.

606
00:46:36,976 --> 00:46:39,044
They may suit my needs.

607
00:46:39,078 --> 00:46:41,046
Tell me of their training.

608
00:47:00,895 --> 00:47:03,160
They begin their
training at five.

609
00:47:03,663 --> 00:47:05,631
Every day they drill
from dawn to dusk

610
00:47:05,666 --> 00:47:07,834
until they have mastered
the shortsword,

611
00:47:07,868 --> 00:47:10,269
the shield,
and the three spears.

612
00:47:10,304 --> 00:47:13,907
Only one boy in four survives
this rigorous training.

613
00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:19,979
<i>Their discipline
and loyalty are absolute.</i>

614
00:47:20,013 --> 00:47:21,781
<i>They fear nothing.</i>

615
00:47:21,815 --> 00:47:24,850
Even the bravest men
fear death.

616
00:47:46,006 --> 00:47:48,975
<i>My master says
the Unsullied are not men.</i>

617
00:47:49,009 --> 00:47:51,377
Death means nothing to them.

618
00:47:59,886 --> 00:48:02,854
He begs you attend to this
carefully, Your Grace.

619
00:48:17,502 --> 00:48:19,837
Tell the good master
there is no need.

620
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:30,247
<i>My master points out
that men don't need nipples.</i>

621
00:48:46,065 --> 00:48:48,233
To win his shield,

622
00:48:48,267 --> 00:48:52,003
an Unsullied must go to the
slave marts with a silver mark,

623
00:48:52,037 --> 00:48:57,008
find a newborn and kill it
before its mother's eyes.

624
00:48:59,345 --> 00:49:01,779
<i>This way, my master says,</i>
<i>we make certain</i>

625
00:49:01,814 --> 00:49:03,915
<i>there is no weakness</i>
<i>left in them.</i>

626
00:49:05,251 --> 00:49:08,053
You take a babe
from its mother's arms,

627
00:49:08,087 --> 00:49:12,390
kill it as she watches, and pay
for her pain with a silver coin?

628
00:49:26,305 --> 00:49:28,906
My master would like you to
know that the silver is paid

629
00:49:28,941 --> 00:49:31,509
to the baby's owner,
not the mother.

630
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:39,617
How many do you have to sell?

631
00:49:44,958 --> 00:49:46,625
8,000.

632
00:49:51,565 --> 00:49:54,201
Master Kraznys asks
that you please hurry.

633
00:49:54,235 --> 00:49:57,070
Many other buyers
are interested.

634
00:50:07,214 --> 00:50:10,383
8,000 dead babies.

635
00:50:10,418 --> 00:50:12,986
The Unsullied
are a means to an end.

636
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:15,355
Once I own them,
these men--

637
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:17,924
They're not men.
Not anymore.

638
00:50:17,958 --> 00:50:21,327
Once I own an army of
slaves, what will I be?

639
00:50:21,361 --> 00:50:23,429
Do you think these slaves
will have better lives

640
00:50:23,463 --> 00:50:26,899
serving Kraznys and men
like him or serving you?

641
00:50:40,613 --> 00:50:42,113
You'll be fair to them.

642
00:50:42,148 --> 00:50:44,916
You won't mutilate them
to make a point.

643
00:50:49,489 --> 00:50:51,690
You won't order them
to murder babies.

644
00:50:51,725 --> 00:50:54,560
You'll see they're properly
fed and sheltered.

645
00:50:54,594 --> 00:50:57,429
A great injustice
has been done to them.

646
00:50:58,599 --> 00:51:01,133
Closing your eyes
will not undo it.

647
00:51:57,922 --> 00:51:59,857
The warlocks.

648
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:06,198
I owe you my life, ser.

649
00:52:06,232 --> 00:52:07,867
The honor is mine,

650
00:52:07,901 --> 00:52:10,102
my queen.

651
00:52:13,473 --> 00:52:15,741
You know this man?

652
00:52:15,775 --> 00:52:17,576
I know him

653
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:22,081
as one of the greatest fighters
the Seven Kingdoms has ever seen

654
00:52:22,115 --> 00:52:23,683
and as the Lord Commander

655
00:52:23,717 --> 00:52:26,485
of Robert Baratheon's
Kingsguard.

656
00:52:28,021 --> 00:52:29,956
King Robert is dead.

657
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:32,859
I have been searching
for you, Daenerys Stormborn,

658
00:52:32,893 --> 00:52:35,428
to ask your forgiveness.

659
00:52:35,462 --> 00:52:38,498
I was sworn to protect
your family.

660
00:52:40,234 --> 00:52:42,168
I failed them.

661
00:52:47,575 --> 00:52:49,843
I am Barristan Selmy,

662
00:52:49,877 --> 00:52:52,179
Kingsguard to your father.

663
00:52:52,213 --> 00:52:54,614
<i>Allow me to join</i>
<i>your Queensguard</i>

664
00:52:54,649 --> 00:52:57,718
and I will not fail you again.

665
