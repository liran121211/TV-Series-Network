00:01:42,383 --> 00:01:47,783
3x09
The Rains of Castamere

3
00:02:05,569 --> 00:02:08,871
<i>Are you sure about this?</i>

4
00:02:08,906 --> 00:02:11,574
No.

5
00:02:11,608 --> 00:02:13,643
It's dangerous.

6
00:02:15,279 --> 00:02:18,247
If we take Tywin's
castle from him,

7
00:02:18,282 --> 00:02:21,550
the lords of Westeros will
realize he's not invincible.

8
00:02:21,618 --> 00:02:23,052
Take his home,

9
00:02:23,153 --> 00:02:25,187
take his gold, take his power.

10
00:02:25,222 --> 00:02:27,323
Why are you telling me?

11
00:02:31,027 --> 00:02:32,861
You begged me not to send Theon

12
00:02:32,896 --> 00:02:36,799
to negotiate with his father
and I ignored your advice.

13
00:02:39,002 --> 00:02:41,137
Now Winterfell is burnt
to the ground,

14
00:02:41,171 --> 00:02:43,339
the North is overrun
with ironborn,

15
00:02:43,373 --> 00:02:45,441
and Bran and Rickon are gone.

16
00:02:47,944 --> 00:02:49,845
So Casterly Rock...

17
00:02:54,317 --> 00:02:56,151
I'm asking your advice.

18
00:03:02,192 --> 00:03:04,426
We have enough men?

19
00:03:08,131 --> 00:03:10,266
If Walder Frey cooperates.

20
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,269
If Walder Frey cooperates.

21
00:03:18,141 --> 00:03:21,477
If reinforcements arrive
from King's Landing

22
00:03:21,511 --> 00:03:23,879
<i>before we take the castle...</i>

23
00:03:25,248 --> 00:03:29,084
we'll be caught between
Tywin's army and the sea.

24
00:03:33,355 --> 00:03:36,857
We'll lose the war and die
the way Father died.

25
00:03:36,891 --> 00:03:38,892
Or worse.

26
00:03:43,864 --> 00:03:47,734
Show them how it feels
to lose what they love.

27
00:04:18,031 --> 00:04:20,533
<i>My honored guests...</i>

28
00:04:22,102 --> 00:04:24,604
be welcome within my walls

29
00:04:24,638 --> 00:04:26,439
and at my table.

30
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:31,144
<i>I extend to you my hospitality</i>

31
00:04:31,179 --> 00:04:35,015
and protection
in the light of the Seven.

32
00:04:35,049 --> 00:04:37,685
We thank you for your
hospitality, my lord.

33
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:44,525
I have come to make
my apologies, my lord,

34
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,427
and to beg your forgiveness.

35
00:04:46,461 --> 00:04:49,830
Don't beg my forgiveness,
Your Grace.

36
00:04:51,233 --> 00:04:54,368
It wasn't me you spurned.
It was my girls.

37
00:05:06,381 --> 00:05:09,550
<i>One of them was supposed</i>
<i>to be queen.</i>

38
00:05:09,584 --> 00:05:11,251
Now none of them are.

39
00:05:12,387 --> 00:05:15,822
This is Arwyen my daughter.

40
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:20,460
<i>My daughter Walda,</i>
<i>my daughter Derwa,</i>

41
00:05:20,494 --> 00:05:23,062
<i>my daughter Waldra.</i>

42
00:05:27,567 --> 00:05:29,802
My eldest granddaughters

43
00:05:29,837 --> 00:05:33,138
<i>Ginia and Neila.</i>

44
00:05:34,775 --> 00:05:39,212
<i>Serra and Sarra,</i>
<i>granddaughters, twins.</i>

45
00:05:39,246 --> 00:05:40,813
You could have had either.

46
00:05:40,847 --> 00:05:44,117
<i>Could have had both</i>
<i>for all I care.</i>

47
00:05:44,151 --> 00:05:46,585
My granddaughter Marianne.

48
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,488
<i>My granddaughter Freya.</i>

49
00:05:50,924 --> 00:05:53,325
My granddaughter...

50
00:05:53,359 --> 00:05:54,960
Wertha.

51
00:05:57,196 --> 00:06:00,264
<i>Waldra.</i>

52
00:06:00,332 --> 00:06:02,300
Waldina.

53
00:06:02,368 --> 00:06:05,136
- I'm Merry.
- Fine.

54
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:08,940
And here's my youngest
daughter Shirei,

55
00:06:08,975 --> 00:06:11,911
<i>though she hasn't bled yet.</i>

56
00:06:11,945 --> 00:06:14,814
Clearly you don't have
the patience for all that.

57
00:06:16,183 --> 00:06:17,817
My ladies.

58
00:06:17,851 --> 00:06:21,354
All men should keep their
word, kings most of all.

59
00:06:22,956 --> 00:06:25,925
I was pledged to marry one
of you and I broke that vow.

60
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:28,127
<i>The fault is not with you.</i>

61
00:06:28,195 --> 00:06:31,564
<i>Any man would be lucky</i>
<i>to have any one of you.</i>

62
00:06:31,598 --> 00:06:34,500
<i>I did what I did</i>
<i>not to slight you,</i>

63
00:06:34,534 --> 00:06:36,369
but because I loved another.

64
00:06:36,403 --> 00:06:38,304
<i>I know these words</i>
<i>cannot set right</i>

65
00:06:38,338 --> 00:06:40,372
<i>the wrong I have done</i>
<i>to you and your house.</i>

66
00:06:40,407 --> 00:06:43,709
I beg your forgiveness

67
00:06:43,743 --> 00:06:46,845
and pledge to do
all I can to make amends

68
00:06:46,913 --> 00:06:49,715
so the Freys of the Crossing
and the Starks of Winterfell

69
00:06:49,783 --> 00:06:51,683
may once again be friends.

70
00:06:59,025 --> 00:07:00,893
<i>Very good.</i>

71
00:07:03,163 --> 00:07:05,030
There she is.

72
00:07:05,065 --> 00:07:07,199
<i>Come closer.</i>

73
00:07:07,233 --> 00:07:09,200
Let me have a look at you.

74
00:07:15,741 --> 00:07:18,342
Still can't see you.

75
00:07:18,376 --> 00:07:20,511
Old eyes.

76
00:07:35,228 --> 00:07:37,396
Love.

77
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:41,301
<i>That's what the Starks</i>
<i>of Winterfell call it, eh?</i>

78
00:07:43,404 --> 00:07:45,438
Very honorable.

79
00:07:45,472 --> 00:07:47,740
I call it a pretty face.

80
00:07:47,775 --> 00:07:50,844
Mmm, very pretty.

81
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,048
Prettier than this lot,
that's for sure.

82
00:07:56,918 --> 00:07:58,652
Very shapely as well.

83
00:08:00,288 --> 00:08:03,357
<i>Oh, you try to hide her</i>
<i>under that dress.</i>

84
00:08:03,391 --> 00:08:05,359
If you wanted to hide her,

85
00:08:05,394 --> 00:08:07,762
you shouldn't have brought her
here in the first place.

86
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:15,437
I can always see

87
00:08:15,471 --> 00:08:18,306
what's going on
beneath a dress.

88
00:08:18,341 --> 00:08:21,243
<i>Been at this a long time.</i>

89
00:08:22,511 --> 00:08:25,146
<i>I bet when you take</i>
<i>that dress off,</i>

90
00:08:25,181 --> 00:08:27,882
everything stays
right where it is.

91
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,716
Doesn't drop an inch.

92
00:08:31,686 --> 00:08:35,254
Your king says he betrayed
me for love.

93
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:38,024
I say he betrayed me
for firm tits

94
00:08:38,058 --> 00:08:40,660
and a tight fit.

95
00:08:40,694 --> 00:08:43,362
And I can respect that.

96
00:08:45,131 --> 00:08:48,400
When I was your age,
I'd have broken 50 oaths

97
00:08:48,434 --> 00:08:51,869
to get into that
without a second thought.

98
00:08:55,274 --> 00:08:58,676
Well, I've enough room
in the hall for you lot.

99
00:08:58,711 --> 00:09:00,778
We'll set up tents outside

100
00:09:00,813 --> 00:09:03,181
with food and ale
for the rest of your men.

101
00:09:03,215 --> 00:09:05,383
Thank you, my lord.

102
00:09:08,654 --> 00:09:10,222
Well, let's get ready.

103
00:09:10,256 --> 00:09:12,291
The wine will flow red

104
00:09:12,325 --> 00:09:15,795
<i>and the music will play loud</i>

105
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:20,033
and we'll put
this mess behind us.

106
00:09:29,243 --> 00:09:30,743
Where?

107
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,378
There.

108
00:09:39,486 --> 00:09:42,355
There.
It's a back gate.

109
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:45,291
My men use it when they
visit Yunkai's bed slaves.

110
00:09:45,326 --> 00:09:47,027
Your men, but not you?

111
00:09:47,061 --> 00:09:48,695
<i>I have no
interest in slaves.</i>

112
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,998
A man cannot make love
to property.

113
00:09:54,236 --> 00:09:55,903
This is where
we enter the city.

114
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:57,405
Very few guards.
They know me.

115
00:09:57,439 --> 00:09:58,940
They let me inside--

116
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:01,209
We're not gonna sneak
an army through a back gate.

117
00:10:01,244 --> 00:10:04,213
I kill the guards.
I take your two best men

118
00:10:04,247 --> 00:10:07,616
and lead them through the back
streets, which I know well,

119
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,751
and open the front gates.

120
00:10:09,785 --> 00:10:11,386
Then comes the army.

121
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,055
Once the walls are breached,
the city will fall in hours.

122
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:16,993
Or perhaps you'll lead Grey
Worm and me to the slaughter,

123
00:10:17,027 --> 00:10:19,495
cutting the head off our army.

124
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:22,265
<i>The masters of Yunkai</i>
<i>will pay you your fee</i>

125
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,667
and you won't have
to split it three ways

126
00:10:23,701 --> 00:10:25,702
'cause you've already
slaughtered your partners.

127
00:10:25,737 --> 00:10:28,205
You have
a very suspicious mind.

128
00:10:28,239 --> 00:10:31,308
In my experience, only dishonest
people think this way.

129
00:10:33,845 --> 00:10:35,679
You command the Unsullied.

130
00:10:35,713 --> 00:10:38,082
<i>What do you think?</i>

131
00:10:38,116 --> 00:10:40,684
_

132
00:10:40,954 --> 00:10:43,659
_

133
00:10:46,535 --> 00:10:49,962
_

134
00:10:50,895 --> 00:10:52,062
You leave tonight.

135
00:10:52,096 --> 00:10:54,197
Very good.

136
00:10:54,231 --> 00:10:56,032
We'll prepare.

137
00:11:01,104 --> 00:11:02,738
Ser Jorah.

138
00:11:04,841 --> 00:11:06,442
You can use an extra sword.

139
00:11:06,476 --> 00:11:08,978
You're the Queensguard,
Ser Barristan.

140
00:11:09,012 --> 00:11:11,047
Your place is by the queen.

141
00:11:11,081 --> 00:11:13,516
If we are truly
her loyal servants,

142
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,585
we'll do whatever
needs to be done

143
00:11:15,619 --> 00:11:19,756
no matter the cost,
no matter our pride.

144
00:11:22,827 --> 00:11:25,329
We're west of Castle Black,

145
00:11:25,363 --> 00:11:27,364
but the Nightfort's
closest to us.

146
00:11:27,431 --> 00:11:30,534
It was the first
castle on the Wall.

147
00:11:30,568 --> 00:11:33,970
The Watch abandoned it during
the reign of King Jaehaerys I.

148
00:11:34,005 --> 00:11:37,674
Too big.
Impossible to maintain.

149
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:40,043
Other than Castle Black itself,

150
00:11:40,077 --> 00:11:42,545
the Nightfort's
the perfect castle for us.

151
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:46,049
It's got a secret sally port,

152
00:11:46,117 --> 00:11:48,685
the Black Gate,
as old as the Wall itself.

153
00:11:48,719 --> 00:11:52,455
No one's used it
in centuries most likely.

154
00:11:52,489 --> 00:11:55,157
It leads through the Wall

155
00:11:55,192 --> 00:11:57,092
right down into the Nightfort,

156
00:11:57,127 --> 00:11:58,994
if one knows how to find it,

157
00:11:59,029 --> 00:12:01,930
which, it just
so happens, I do.

158
00:12:06,569 --> 00:12:09,270
How do you know all that?

159
00:12:09,338 --> 00:12:13,241
I read about it
in a very old book.

160
00:12:18,747 --> 00:12:20,314
You know all that

161
00:12:20,348 --> 00:12:23,283
from staring at marks on paper?

162
00:12:24,352 --> 00:12:26,353
Yes.

163
00:12:26,421 --> 00:12:29,156
You're like a wizard.

164
00:12:44,307 --> 00:12:46,342
Our father used to tell us

165
00:12:46,376 --> 00:12:50,747
that no wildling ever looked
upon the Wall and lived.

166
00:12:50,782 --> 00:12:53,283
Here we are.

167
00:12:53,351 --> 00:12:55,653
Alive.

168
00:13:11,903 --> 00:13:14,671
Remember what happens
to children who run.

169
00:13:14,705 --> 00:13:17,541
I'm your father
and I'll do the talking.

170
00:13:27,452 --> 00:13:29,787
The roads have gone
right to hell, haven't they?

171
00:13:29,821 --> 00:13:31,956
Cracked three spokes
this morning.

172
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,992
- Need a hand?
- Need about eight hands.

173
00:13:34,026 --> 00:13:35,960
Oh!

174
00:13:35,994 --> 00:13:38,162
Got to get this
salt pork to the Twins

175
00:13:38,197 --> 00:13:40,798
in time for the wedding.

176
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:43,334
Many thanks.

177
00:13:45,504 --> 00:13:47,071
Don't!

178
00:13:47,105 --> 00:13:48,406
Don't kill him.

179
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,608
Dead rats don't squeak.

180
00:13:50,642 --> 00:13:52,310
You're so dangerous,
aren't you?

181
00:13:52,377 --> 00:13:54,378
Saying scary things
to little girls.

182
00:13:54,413 --> 00:13:57,181
Killing little boys
and old people.

183
00:13:57,248 --> 00:13:58,649
A real hard man you are.

184
00:13:58,683 --> 00:14:00,651
More than anyone you know.

185
00:14:00,685 --> 00:14:03,420
You're wrong.
I know a killer.

186
00:14:03,455 --> 00:14:06,090
- A real killer.
- That so?

187
00:14:06,124 --> 00:14:07,725
You'd be like a kitten to him.

188
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:10,094
He'd kill you
with his little finger.

189
00:14:10,128 --> 00:14:12,229
That him?

190
00:14:13,598 --> 00:14:15,632
- No.
- Good.

191
00:14:16,901 --> 00:14:18,602
Don't kill him.

192
00:14:18,669 --> 00:14:20,904
Please.

193
00:14:20,938 --> 00:14:23,073
Please don't.

194
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,777
You're very kind.

195
00:14:27,812 --> 00:14:29,779
Someday it'll get you killed.

196
00:14:47,131 --> 00:14:48,965
Where are we?

197
00:14:49,032 --> 00:14:51,200
The Gift, I think.

198
00:14:51,235 --> 00:14:52,869
Brandon the Builder
gave all this land

199
00:14:52,903 --> 00:14:54,971
<i>south of the Wall</i>
<i>to the Night's Watch</i>

200
00:14:55,006 --> 00:14:57,941
for their sustenance
and support.

201
00:14:57,976 --> 00:15:00,244
Maester Luwin taught me that.

202
00:15:02,047 --> 00:15:04,315
Doesn't seem to be supporting
anyone at the moment.

203
00:15:04,349 --> 00:15:08,052
It's good land
and there's no war up here.

204
00:15:08,086 --> 00:15:09,587
Why leave?

205
00:15:09,654 --> 00:15:11,322
Wildlings.

206
00:15:11,356 --> 00:15:13,090
Sorry.

207
00:15:13,124 --> 00:15:15,826
But they come over
the Wall and raid,

208
00:15:15,893 --> 00:15:17,694
steal, carry off women.

209
00:15:17,728 --> 00:15:19,929
Old Nan said they turn
your skull into a cup

210
00:15:19,964 --> 00:15:22,031
and make you drink
your own blood from it.

211
00:15:24,701 --> 00:15:26,402
That's what Old Nan said.

212
00:15:26,436 --> 00:15:28,104
There's a storm coming.

213
00:15:29,473 --> 00:15:31,774
I don't see any--

214
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:36,979
It's as good a place
to shelter as any.

215
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,585
We can drink some blood
while we wait.

216
00:15:42,652 --> 00:15:44,753
I don't need much.

217
00:15:56,567 --> 00:15:59,002
Only one old man
and eight good horses.

218
00:15:59,069 --> 00:16:02,138
What's one old man
doing with eight horses?

219
00:16:02,172 --> 00:16:04,039
He breeds them for the Watch.

220
00:16:04,074 --> 00:16:06,042
How's he keep folks
from stealing them?

221
00:16:06,076 --> 00:16:08,411
The Watch protects him.

222
00:16:08,446 --> 00:16:10,680
Not today they don't.

223
00:16:10,715 --> 00:16:13,384
He's selling horses,
he's got some gold in there.

224
00:16:13,418 --> 00:16:16,620
<i>- And proper steel.</i>
- Let's carve him up.

225
00:16:16,655 --> 00:16:18,022
We just take the horses and go.

226
00:16:18,056 --> 00:16:20,725
The old man's no threat.

227
00:16:21,761 --> 00:16:23,194
I keep telling you.

228
00:16:23,228 --> 00:16:25,363
He's an old man.

229
00:16:25,397 --> 00:16:27,865
A spear through the heart's
a better way to die

230
00:16:27,933 --> 00:16:30,373
than coughing up your last with
no one but your horses to hear.

231
00:16:31,904 --> 00:16:35,239
The Watch might send a few men
looking for a horse thief.

232
00:16:35,274 --> 00:16:38,142
They'll send a lot more
to hunt down murderers.

233
00:16:38,177 --> 00:16:40,011
I hope so.

234
00:16:40,045 --> 00:16:42,981
Killing crows
in their castle is tough.

235
00:16:43,016 --> 00:16:44,950
Killing them out here
in the open,

236
00:16:45,017 --> 00:16:46,685
that's what we do.

237
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:48,453
Spread out.

238
00:16:48,521 --> 00:16:51,056
Surround the hut and move in.

239
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,066
Ygritte!

240
00:17:37,136 --> 00:17:39,637
<i>Clear the barn!</i>

241
00:18:16,808 --> 00:18:20,210
No one's going to believe you're a
hog farmer if you eat them all.

242
00:18:20,278 --> 00:18:22,546
Best part of the animal.

243
00:18:27,253 --> 00:18:29,454
Don't worry.
They're still there.

244
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:32,291
I know they're still there.

245
00:18:32,325 --> 00:18:34,059
You check every five minutes

246
00:18:34,127 --> 00:18:36,661
like you're afraid
they're gonna move.

247
00:18:36,696 --> 00:18:38,463
I'm not afraid.

248
00:18:38,498 --> 00:18:40,732
Of course you are.

249
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:43,068
You're almost there

250
00:18:43,102 --> 00:18:45,704
and you're afraid
you won't make it.

251
00:18:45,772 --> 00:18:49,141
The closer you get,
the worse the fear gets.

252
00:18:49,175 --> 00:18:52,612
No point in trying to hide
behind that face.

253
00:18:52,646 --> 00:18:55,548
<i>I know fear when I see it.</i>

254
00:18:55,582 --> 00:18:57,450
Seen it a lot.

255
00:18:58,752 --> 00:19:01,287
I knew fear
when I saw it in you.

256
00:19:02,756 --> 00:19:05,559
You're afraid of fire.

257
00:19:05,627 --> 00:19:07,328
When Beric's sword
went up in flames,

258
00:19:07,362 --> 00:19:09,196
you looked like
a scared little girl.

259
00:19:12,835 --> 00:19:15,169
And I know why, too.

260
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,474
<i>I heard what</i>
<i>your brother did to you.</i>

261
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:21,910
Pressed your face to the fire

262
00:19:21,978 --> 00:19:24,546
like you're a nice
juicy mutton chop.

263
00:19:28,351 --> 00:19:30,519
That give you some ideas?

264
00:19:33,356 --> 00:19:36,025
Might do.

265
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:38,394
Go ahead, then.

266
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:40,796
You might get away.

267
00:19:40,831 --> 00:19:43,366
Might even make it
there on your own.

268
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:46,669
They're just over the river.

269
00:19:46,703 --> 00:19:48,838
The closest you've
been to family

270
00:19:48,872 --> 00:19:51,907
since Ilyn Payne
snipped your daddy's neck.

271
00:19:55,345 --> 00:19:58,347
Someday I'm gonna put
a sword through your eye

272
00:19:58,381 --> 00:20:00,015
and out the back of your skull.

273
00:20:24,739 --> 00:20:28,174
How are we going
to get past the Wall?

274
00:20:28,209 --> 00:20:30,143
My uncle said
it's 700 feet high.

275
00:20:35,483 --> 00:20:37,050
How did you get past it?

276
00:20:41,088 --> 00:20:43,823
Got in a boat and rowed
past the Bay of Seals.

277
00:20:43,858 --> 00:20:47,059
It would take us two months
to get to the Bay of Seals.

278
00:20:47,093 --> 00:20:49,228
Some climb straight up the ice.

279
00:20:49,295 --> 00:20:52,564
Even Hodor's not strong enough to
climb the Wall with me on his back.

280
00:20:52,632 --> 00:20:55,801
Hodor.

281
00:20:55,835 --> 00:20:58,370
19 castles guard the Wall.

282
00:20:58,405 --> 00:21:01,774
- Only three are still manned.
- Hodor!

283
00:21:01,809 --> 00:21:04,043
One of those abandoned fortresses
will give us a way through.

284
00:21:04,077 --> 00:21:06,312
My uncle said the gates were
sealed with ice and stone

285
00:21:06,346 --> 00:21:07,780
when the castles were deserted.

286
00:21:07,814 --> 00:21:11,117
Well, we'll have
to open them up again.

287
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,455
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
<i>- There's a rider out there.</i>

288
00:21:16,758 --> 00:21:18,692
Just one?

289
00:21:18,726 --> 00:21:20,494
<i>- There's more.</i>
- Hodor!

290
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:23,363
Shh. Shh.

291
00:21:23,398 --> 00:21:26,133
- It's just thunder, sweet giant.
- Hodor.

292
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:28,535
I yield.

293
00:21:28,603 --> 00:21:30,237
- <i>I yield.</i>
- Wildlings.

294
00:21:35,344 --> 00:21:36,845
Where's Shaggydog and Summer?

295
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:38,880
Hunting.

296
00:21:38,948 --> 00:21:40,916
Hodor!

297
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:43,251
- Shh, quiet, Hodor.
- Hodor!

298
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:45,286
Make him shut up.
If they hear us...

299
00:21:45,321 --> 00:21:47,489
- Hush, Hodor. No-- no more Hodoring.
- Hodor!

300
00:21:47,523 --> 00:21:50,425
- Hodor!
- Hodor, calm down.

301
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,793
- You need to keep quiet.
- They're gonna hear us.

302
00:21:51,828 --> 00:21:53,995
<i>Hodor, be quiet.</i>

303
00:21:55,598 --> 00:21:57,666
- Ah! Hodor!
- Hodor, calm down.

304
00:21:57,734 --> 00:22:00,702
- Hodor! Hodor!
- Hodor, be quiet!

305
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:24,659
What did you do?

306
00:22:24,693 --> 00:22:27,428
Nothing.

307
00:22:27,462 --> 00:22:29,397
I don't know.

308
00:22:33,502 --> 00:22:35,103
What's that?

309
00:22:36,338 --> 00:22:38,607
That's a horse dying.

310
00:22:48,684 --> 00:22:51,252
<i>Bring them over here.</i>

311
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:54,455
<i>That was the last of them.
The rest are dead.</i>

312
00:22:54,489 --> 00:22:56,723
<i>I heard shouting up there.</i>

313
00:22:56,758 --> 00:22:58,892
Thunder.

314
00:22:58,926 --> 00:23:01,494
I know the difference
between shouting and thunder.

315
00:23:01,529 --> 00:23:04,663
Maybe it's ghosts.

316
00:23:14,574 --> 00:23:16,909
That won't help you, grandpa.

317
00:23:21,281 --> 00:23:22,948
Where you riding?

318
00:23:22,982 --> 00:23:24,983
Doesn't matter now, does it?

319
00:23:25,018 --> 00:23:27,753
No, it doesn't matter now.

320
00:23:29,456 --> 00:23:32,858
Cut his throat or he'll
tell the crows we're here.

321
00:23:38,765 --> 00:23:40,499
You understand.

322
00:23:40,534 --> 00:23:42,501
Let me stand at least.

323
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:45,938
<i>Let me go</i>
<i>with a bit of dignity.</i>

324
00:23:50,977 --> 00:23:52,678
Make the crow kill him.

325
00:23:56,216 --> 00:23:59,619
You're one of us now.
Prove it.

326
00:24:03,825 --> 00:24:06,427
The wolves are out there.

327
00:24:09,331 --> 00:24:11,065
I can't do it by choice.

328
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:15,137
I don't know how.
It happens in my dreams.

329
00:24:15,171 --> 00:24:17,273
You're a warg, Bran.

330
00:24:17,307 --> 00:24:19,375
It's in your blood.

331
00:24:19,409 --> 00:24:20,877
I can't.

332
00:24:20,911 --> 00:24:22,812
You just did with him.

333
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,848
A wolf is nothing
compared to that.

334
00:24:32,556 --> 00:24:34,290
She looks sharp.

335
00:24:43,901 --> 00:24:45,970
Do it.

336
00:24:46,972 --> 00:24:48,439
Do it.

337
00:24:48,473 --> 00:24:51,608
I told you.
He's still one of them.

338
00:24:53,811 --> 00:24:55,378
Go on, boy.

339
00:24:58,282 --> 00:24:59,582
Go on!

340
00:25:08,358 --> 00:25:10,159
He's a crow.

341
00:25:10,193 --> 00:25:12,127
<i>He'll always be a crow.</i>

342
00:25:12,162 --> 00:25:14,529
And here's his crow wife
guarding him.

343
00:25:14,563 --> 00:25:17,766
He'll stab us in the back
first chance he gets.

344
00:25:20,703 --> 00:25:23,071
Kill him.

345
00:25:38,354 --> 00:25:40,389
- He's one of them.
- No!

346
00:25:40,423 --> 00:25:41,923
Do you hear me?

347
00:25:47,931 --> 00:25:51,233
You're not gonna die
for one of them.

348
00:25:53,036 --> 00:25:55,538
Do it.

349
00:25:55,572 --> 00:25:57,406
They'll find us if you don't.

350
00:26:27,106 --> 00:26:29,074
You were right the whole time.

351
00:26:55,066 --> 00:26:56,633
Hyah!

352
00:27:15,687 --> 00:27:18,322
<i>When you hear a
songbird's whistle, you come.</i>

353
00:27:18,356 --> 00:27:22,126
I'm a great whistler.
The greatest in the land.

354
00:27:27,004 --> 00:27:30,100
Daario Naharis.

355
00:27:57,995 --> 00:28:00,363
<i>That one was quick.</i>

356
00:28:03,133 --> 00:28:05,167
- There may be others.
- I doubt it.

357
00:28:05,202 --> 00:28:08,070
The Yunkish prefer to let their
slaves do their fighting for them.

358
00:28:53,285 --> 00:28:55,987
That's what you call
a few guards?

359
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:22,381
Come on!
What do you got, huh?

360
00:30:36,454 --> 00:30:39,156
Lord Edmure...

361
00:30:40,826 --> 00:30:43,094
I hope I'm not
a disappointment to you.

362
00:30:51,637 --> 00:30:54,106
You're a delight
to me, my lady.

363
00:30:55,742 --> 00:30:57,410
You may now cloak the bride

364
00:30:57,444 --> 00:30:59,512
and bring her under
your protection.

365
00:31:28,576 --> 00:31:30,176
In the sight of the Seven,

366
00:31:30,211 --> 00:31:33,880
I hereby seal these two souls,

367
00:31:33,915 --> 00:31:37,517
binding them as one
for eternity.

368
00:31:37,552 --> 00:31:40,487
<i>Look upon each other</i>
<i>and say the words.</i>

369
00:31:43,057 --> 00:31:45,325
Father, Smith,

370
00:31:45,393 --> 00:31:47,727
Warrior, Mother,

371
00:31:47,762 --> 00:31:50,798
Maiden, Crone, Stranger...

372
00:31:50,832 --> 00:31:52,933
- I am hers...
- I am his...

373
00:31:52,968 --> 00:31:55,102
- <i>and she is mine...</i>
- <i>and he is mine...</i>

374
00:31:55,137 --> 00:31:59,140
<i>...from this day</i>
<i>until the end of my days.</i>

375
00:32:03,846 --> 00:32:06,715
- Is that safe?
- They're long gone.

376
00:32:12,154 --> 00:32:13,687
You were right.

377
00:32:13,755 --> 00:32:16,256
I can get inside Summer's
mind whenever I want.

378
00:32:16,323 --> 00:32:18,491
Of course you can.

379
00:32:19,793 --> 00:32:21,093
North of the Wall
there are wildlings

380
00:32:21,128 --> 00:32:24,129
who can control
all sorts of animals.

381
00:32:24,164 --> 00:32:26,498
<i>But you did a lot</i>
<i>more than that.</i>

382
00:32:28,301 --> 00:32:31,403
You got inside Hodor's mind.

383
00:32:31,437 --> 00:32:34,272
They can't do that
north of the Wall?

384
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:38,711
No one can do that...

385
00:32:38,745 --> 00:32:39,846
<i>anywhere.</i>

386
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:49,155
When I was looking
through Summer's eyes,

387
00:32:49,189 --> 00:32:50,856
- I saw Jon.
- Where?

388
00:32:50,891 --> 00:32:52,658
He was with the wildlings.

389
00:32:52,692 --> 00:32:54,727
They tried to kill him,
but he got away.

390
00:32:54,761 --> 00:32:56,395
<i>He'll be heading back
to Castle Black, then.</i>

391
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:58,264
That's where we should go.

392
00:32:58,298 --> 00:33:00,666
For all we know, Castle
Black's already under attack.

393
00:33:00,701 --> 00:33:03,502
- If this many wildlings got through--
- I already told you.

394
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:05,538
I'm not going
north of the Wall.

395
00:33:05,572 --> 00:33:08,541
Everything Jojen
told me is true.

396
00:33:10,477 --> 00:33:12,745
You saw what I did to Hodor.

397
00:33:12,779 --> 00:33:14,747
<i>I have to find</i>
<i>the three-eyed raven.</i>

398
00:33:14,781 --> 00:33:16,349
Listen to me, little lord.

399
00:33:16,383 --> 00:33:17,616
Don't worry.

400
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:20,753
I'm not asking you
to come with me.

401
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:24,457
It won't be safe for Rickon.

402
00:33:24,492 --> 00:33:27,561
Me?
I'm coming with you.

403
00:33:27,595 --> 00:33:30,097
No.

404
00:33:30,131 --> 00:33:32,766
You and Osha and Shaggydog
head for the Last Hearth.

405
00:33:32,801 --> 00:33:36,003
The Umbers are our bannermen.
They'll protect you.

406
00:33:36,038 --> 00:33:37,772
I'm coming with you.

407
00:33:37,806 --> 00:33:39,674
I'm your brother.

408
00:33:39,708 --> 00:33:42,010
I have to protect you.

409
00:33:43,913 --> 00:33:47,248
Right now I have
to protect you.

410
00:33:47,283 --> 00:33:50,418
Robb's at war and I'm
going beyond the Wall.

411
00:33:50,452 --> 00:33:52,821
If something happens to us,

412
00:33:52,855 --> 00:33:54,923
you're the heir to Winterfell.

413
00:33:56,959 --> 00:33:59,161
Would you know how
to find the Last Hearth?

414
00:33:59,195 --> 00:34:02,298
You southerners build your big
castles and you never move.

415
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:03,966
You're easy to find.

416
00:34:04,034 --> 00:34:06,736
We're not southerners.

417
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:09,839
And I don't want to leave you.

418
00:34:09,873 --> 00:34:12,675
Shh, shh.
Come here, little soldier.

419
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:17,747
You and me, we're gonna
have some adventures.

420
00:34:17,782 --> 00:34:20,150
You don't have to do
any of this.

421
00:34:21,485 --> 00:34:22,952
Your family took me in

422
00:34:22,987 --> 00:34:25,322
and was good to me when
they had no cause to be.

423
00:34:25,356 --> 00:34:27,691
<i>Shh.</i>

424
00:34:27,725 --> 00:34:29,993
We'll be fine, you and me.

425
00:34:30,027 --> 00:34:32,262
The Umbers are great warriors.

426
00:34:32,296 --> 00:34:34,931
Even I heard
about them growing up.

427
00:34:34,966 --> 00:34:37,334
They'll teach you
how to swing a sword.

428
00:34:37,368 --> 00:34:40,904
I know how to swing a sword.

429
00:34:47,811 --> 00:34:50,580
You're leaving now? It's
the middle of the night.

430
00:34:50,614 --> 00:34:52,482
I learned to walk in darkness.

431
00:34:54,952 --> 00:34:56,653
Say your good-byes,
little man.

432
00:35:04,594 --> 00:35:06,829
Keep this one safe.

433
00:35:08,598 --> 00:35:10,665
He means the world to me.

434
00:35:31,756 --> 00:35:34,290
We've been waiting a long time.

435
00:35:36,527 --> 00:35:38,328
Haven't we?

436
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:41,264
I don't know, you tell me.

437
00:35:41,299 --> 00:35:43,500
How long does it take
to sack a city?

438
00:35:51,742 --> 00:35:53,843
It was just as you said.

439
00:35:53,877 --> 00:35:57,279
They did not believe
until it was too late.

440
00:35:57,313 --> 00:35:59,314
Their slave soldiers

441
00:35:59,349 --> 00:36:02,818
threw down their spears
and surrendered.

442
00:36:06,922 --> 00:36:09,491
And Daario Naharis?

443
00:36:30,048 --> 00:36:32,616
The city is yours, my queen.

444
00:36:55,741 --> 00:36:57,275
They're good, aren't they?

445
00:36:57,309 --> 00:36:59,043
They ought to be
because they cost enough.

446
00:37:06,252 --> 00:37:09,454
Look at the crowd there.

447
00:37:12,891 --> 00:37:15,093
He complained
about this marriage

448
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,362
the entire ride from Riverrun,

449
00:37:17,396 --> 00:37:18,897
<i>and now look at him.</i>

450
00:37:18,931 --> 00:37:20,898
<i>The gods
love to reward a fool.</i>

451
00:37:20,933 --> 00:37:23,434
- Uncle.
- What?

452
00:37:23,468 --> 00:37:26,437
He's my nephew.
I love him.

453
00:37:26,471 --> 00:37:28,473
And he's a damned fool.

454
00:37:33,845 --> 00:37:36,247
Don't you drink, Lord Bolton?

455
00:37:36,281 --> 00:37:38,583
Never do, my lady.
Dulls the senses.

456
00:37:38,617 --> 00:37:40,852
That's the point.

457
00:37:40,886 --> 00:37:42,687
Didn't you marry
one of these Frey girls?

458
00:37:42,721 --> 00:37:44,189
Aye.

459
00:37:44,223 --> 00:37:46,291
Lord Walder let me choose
any of his granddaughters

460
00:37:46,325 --> 00:37:50,428
and promised me the girl's
weight in silver as a dowry.

461
00:37:50,496 --> 00:37:52,297
So I have a fat young bride.

462
00:37:54,333 --> 00:37:56,301
I hope she makes you
very happy.

463
00:37:56,335 --> 00:37:58,136
Well, she's made me very rich.

464
00:37:58,204 --> 00:38:00,806
Pardon, my lord, my lady.

465
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,308
I need to find
a tree to piss on.

466
00:38:05,378 --> 00:38:07,713
My mother's alone
with Roose Bolton.

467
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,181
I should rescue her.

468
00:38:09,215 --> 00:38:11,149
Your mother is less
in need of rescue

469
00:38:11,184 --> 00:38:13,151
than any woman I've ever met.

470
00:38:13,186 --> 00:38:14,253
Be kind.

471
00:38:14,287 --> 00:38:16,288
She's finally starting
to like you.

472
00:38:17,957 --> 00:38:19,758
And I like her.

473
00:38:19,793 --> 00:38:22,995
But if she had her way,
I would be back in Volantis

474
00:38:23,029 --> 00:38:26,298
playing my harp and you
would be sitting over there

475
00:38:26,333 --> 00:38:29,335
<i>eating blackberries</i>
<i>out of Roslin Frey's hand.</i>

476
00:38:29,369 --> 00:38:31,537
Perhaps I've made
a terrible mistake.

477
00:38:34,441 --> 00:38:37,343
Striking your king
is an act of treason.

478
00:38:40,681 --> 00:38:42,449
No, don't.

479
00:38:43,384 --> 00:38:45,018
Don't insult them.

480
00:38:47,688 --> 00:38:49,689
Your Grace.

481
00:38:56,463 --> 00:39:00,366
The septon has prayed
his prayers,

482
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,601
<i>some words were said,</i>

483
00:39:02,636 --> 00:39:04,436
and Lord Edmure

484
00:39:04,504 --> 00:39:07,405
has wrapped my daughter
in a cloak.

485
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,877
But they are not yet
man and wife.

486
00:39:11,911 --> 00:39:14,480
A sword needs a sheath.

487
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,289
And a wedding needs a bedding.

488
00:39:24,324 --> 00:39:26,191
What does my sire say?

489
00:39:26,226 --> 00:39:29,228
To bed! To bed! To bed!

490
00:39:34,534 --> 00:39:36,936
If you think the time
is right, Lord Walder,

491
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:41,173
by all means, let us bed them.

492
00:39:47,781 --> 00:39:50,450
To bed! To bed! To bed!

493
00:39:56,457 --> 00:39:58,959
<i>Go on!</i>

494
00:40:16,645 --> 00:40:19,747
Oh!
Careful now, ladies.

495
00:40:19,781 --> 00:40:21,815
Once you set that monster free,

496
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:24,618
there's no caging him again.

497
00:40:24,652 --> 00:40:27,954
To bed! To bed! To bed!

498
00:40:31,692 --> 00:40:33,293
Poor girl.

499
00:40:33,327 --> 00:40:36,229
Every bride suffers the same.

500
00:40:36,263 --> 00:40:38,865
I'm sure you endured
yours with grace.

501
00:40:38,899 --> 00:40:41,401
Oh, Ned forbade it.

502
00:40:41,436 --> 00:40:44,638
He said it wouldn't be right if he broke
a man's jaw on our wedding night.

503
00:40:53,115 --> 00:40:56,216
That is a very strange custom.

504
00:40:56,251 --> 00:40:58,152
I suppose it does seem strange

505
00:40:58,186 --> 00:40:59,853
from a foreigner's perspective.

506
00:40:59,888 --> 00:41:01,689
It seems normal to you?

507
00:41:01,756 --> 00:41:04,125
It's a tradition.

508
00:41:05,961 --> 00:41:08,829
Without the bedding ceremony,
there's no real proof

509
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:11,399
the lord and lady
consummated their marriage.

510
00:41:11,433 --> 00:41:14,769
But there are other ways
of providing proof.

511
00:41:17,139 --> 00:41:18,906
Boy or girl?

512
00:41:21,277 --> 00:41:22,978
I don't know.

513
00:41:23,012 --> 00:41:26,181
But if it's a boy, I know
what we should name him.

514
00:41:26,215 --> 00:41:28,383
Oh, do you?

515
00:41:28,417 --> 00:41:31,854
It seems to me the father should
have some say in his son's naming.

516
00:41:31,921 --> 00:41:33,255
Eddard.

517
00:41:36,926 --> 00:41:38,961
Don't you want to teach
little Ned Stark

518
00:41:38,995 --> 00:41:41,430
how to ride horses?

519
00:41:41,464 --> 00:41:43,665
I do.

520
00:42:11,792 --> 00:42:15,194
<i>[ Band playing</i>
<i>"Rains of Castamere" ]</i>

521
00:42:39,587 --> 00:42:41,755
<i>Go on, line 'em up!</i>

522
00:42:58,408 --> 00:43:00,810
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

523
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:05,615
Where are you going?

524
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:07,383
Got salt pork for the feast.

525
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:09,618
The feast is over.

526
00:43:09,653 --> 00:43:12,054
<i>Doesn't sound
like it's over.</i>

527
00:43:12,088 --> 00:43:14,956
If I tell you
it's over, it's over.

528
00:43:14,991 --> 00:43:19,193
Turn this cart around
and get the hell out of here.

529
00:43:19,228 --> 00:43:21,195
Got pig's feet, too.

530
00:43:22,363 --> 00:43:24,464
Are you soft in the head?

531
00:43:24,499 --> 00:43:26,233
Turn this cart around.

532
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:40,513
Your Grace.

533
00:43:46,354 --> 00:43:50,690
<i>I feel I've been remiss</i>

534
00:43:50,724 --> 00:43:52,458
in my duties.

535
00:43:52,492 --> 00:43:56,196
<i>I've given you meat</i>
<i>and wine and music,</i>

536
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:58,898
<i>but I haven't shown you</i>

537
00:43:58,933 --> 00:44:02,001
<i>the hospitality you deserve.</i>

538
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:04,638
<i>My king has married</i>

539
00:44:04,672 --> 00:44:08,108
<i>and I owe my new queen</i>
<i>a wedding gift.</i>

540
00:44:12,881 --> 00:44:15,383
Robb!

541
00:45:02,195 --> 00:45:04,296
You ready to
head home to Winterfell, right?

542
00:45:07,534 --> 00:45:09,034
<i>Feast over yet, is it?</i>

543
00:45:09,069 --> 00:45:11,570
Aye, it's over.

544
00:45:41,901 --> 00:45:43,701
Follow him.

545
00:45:46,205 --> 00:45:48,506
<i>Aim!</i>

546
00:46:17,171 --> 00:46:19,506
It's too late.

547
00:47:00,346 --> 00:47:03,448
The King in the North arises.

548
00:47:25,105 --> 00:47:27,306
Lord Walder!

549
00:47:27,374 --> 00:47:28,974
Lord Walder, enough!

550
00:47:29,008 --> 00:47:31,443
Let it end!

551
00:47:33,046 --> 00:47:35,080
Please.

552
00:47:35,147 --> 00:47:37,249
He is my son.

553
00:47:37,316 --> 00:47:39,584
<i>My first son.</i>

554
00:47:39,619 --> 00:47:42,187
Let him go and I swear
that we will forget this.

555
00:47:42,222 --> 00:47:44,890
I swear it by
the old gods and new.

556
00:47:44,924 --> 00:47:46,425
We will take no vengeance.

557
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:50,129
You already swore me one oath
right here in my castle.

558
00:47:50,164 --> 00:47:53,966
You swore by all the gods your
son would marry my daughter!

559
00:47:54,001 --> 00:47:57,336
<i>Take me for a
hostage, but let Robb go.</i>

560
00:47:57,371 --> 00:47:59,538
Robb, get up.

561
00:47:59,573 --> 00:48:01,307
Get up and walk out.

562
00:48:01,341 --> 00:48:03,742
Please!

563
00:48:05,412 --> 00:48:08,147
Please!

564
00:48:08,181 --> 00:48:12,018
And why would I
let him do that?

565
00:48:14,655 --> 00:48:17,390
On my honor as a Tully,

566
00:48:17,458 --> 00:48:20,193
on my honor as a Stark,

567
00:48:20,261 --> 00:48:23,096
let him go

568
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:26,233
or I will cut
your wife's throat.

569
00:48:34,709 --> 00:48:37,310
I'll find another.

570
00:48:40,081 --> 00:48:42,549
Mother.

571
00:48:43,613 --> 00:48:45,318
The Lannisters send
their regards.

572
00:49:23,148 --> 00:49:33,906
