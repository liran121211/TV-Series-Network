00:01:42,562 --> 00:01:47,562
3x02
Dark Wings, Dark Words

3
00:02:41,631 --> 00:02:44,019
Don't think too much, Bran.

4
00:02:45,368 --> 00:02:47,069
Relax your bow arm.

5
00:02:55,778 --> 00:02:58,580
<i>And which one of you
was a marksman at 10?</i>

6
00:02:58,614 --> 00:03:00,482
Father?

7
00:03:08,424 --> 00:03:10,525
You can't kill it, you know.

8
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,294
Why not?

9
00:03:14,564 --> 00:03:16,698
Because the raven is you.

10
00:03:26,476 --> 00:03:27,943
Hodor.

11
00:03:27,977 --> 00:03:29,645
It's all right, Hodor.

12
00:03:29,679 --> 00:03:32,047
Hodor.

13
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,656
<i>Were you inside the
wolf again, little lord?</i>

14
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:42,626
No, it was
the three-eyed raven.

15
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,828
<i>He's back.</i>

16
00:03:46,597 --> 00:03:47,964
I tried to kill it,
but I couldn't.

17
00:03:47,999 --> 00:03:50,934
- There was a boy.
- <i>I don't want to hear about it.</i>

18
00:03:50,968 --> 00:03:53,403
- But you asked.
- We've got plenty of worries.

19
00:03:53,437 --> 00:03:55,839
We don't need to pour
black magic on top of them.

20
00:03:55,873 --> 00:03:59,209
I didn't ask
for black magic dreams.

21
00:03:59,243 --> 00:04:00,944
I know you didn't, little lord.

22
00:04:02,814 --> 00:04:04,748
We need to move.

23
00:04:04,783 --> 00:04:06,383
We don't know
who might be after us.

24
00:04:06,418 --> 00:04:08,152
No one even knows we're alive.

25
00:04:09,354 --> 00:04:11,021
And who told you that?

26
00:04:11,056 --> 00:04:13,257
<i>The three-eyed raven</i>
<i>tell you?</i>

27
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:15,326
- No.
- Some good he is, then.

28
00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:20,732
<i>I don't know what other people
know and what they don't.</i>

29
00:04:20,766 --> 00:04:23,802
I only know the Wall
is a long way off.

30
00:04:33,379 --> 00:04:35,080
My mother always told me

31
00:04:35,114 --> 00:04:37,449
you Westerosi were a grim lot.

32
00:04:38,618 --> 00:04:41,820
Grim, bearded,

33
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,522
stinking barbarians

34
00:04:43,557 --> 00:04:45,991
that would row
across the Narrow Sea

35
00:04:46,025 --> 00:04:48,727
and steal us from our beds.

36
00:04:48,762 --> 00:04:50,963
Did you ever think
you'd marry one?

37
00:04:52,799 --> 00:04:55,535
I never thought
I'd marry anyone at all.

38
00:04:55,569 --> 00:04:57,870
Never?

39
00:04:57,905 --> 00:05:01,407
Not until I met
the king of the grim,

40
00:05:01,441 --> 00:05:03,643
bearded, stinking barbarians.

41
00:05:10,017 --> 00:05:12,419
Pardon me, Your Grace.

42
00:05:12,453 --> 00:05:15,322
- My queen.
- Lord Bolton.

43
00:05:17,726 --> 00:05:19,694
Let me guess which one
is the good news.

44
00:05:21,831 --> 00:05:24,099
Word from Riverrun

45
00:05:24,133 --> 00:05:25,767
and Winterfell.

46
00:05:30,739 --> 00:05:33,174
I hadn't seen him in years.

47
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:37,344
I don't even know how many.

48
00:05:38,914 --> 00:05:40,714
We'll travel
to the funeral together.

49
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,217
<i>Lord Bolton will garrison here</i>

50
00:05:43,251 --> 00:05:45,653
<i>until we return.</i>

51
00:05:45,687 --> 00:05:49,356
Will I be wearing manacles
when I lay my father to rest?

52
00:05:55,129 --> 00:05:57,264
Something else?

53
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,900
By the time Bolton's
bastard got to Winterfell,

54
00:06:00,935 --> 00:06:02,836
the ironborn were gone.

55
00:06:04,372 --> 00:06:07,740
<i>They massacred everyone and
put the castle to the torch.</i>

56
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,112
And Bran and Rickon
have not been found.

57
00:06:16,885 --> 00:06:19,153
They may have escaped.

58
00:06:19,187 --> 00:06:22,490
Or Theon may have taken them back
to the Iron Islands as hostages.

59
00:06:22,524 --> 00:06:24,925
Have you received any demands?

60
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:27,295
No.

61
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:29,930
Have you heard anything
from Theon at all?

62
00:06:51,653 --> 00:06:53,755
Where am I?

63
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:01,730
Who are you?

64
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,171
What do you want?

65
00:07:09,205 --> 00:07:11,340
I want to do this.

66
00:07:16,612 --> 00:07:18,480
Do you know how long
it's going to take us

67
00:07:18,514 --> 00:07:21,216
to get to King's Landing walking
through fields and forests?

68
00:07:21,251 --> 00:07:22,918
Yes.

69
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:25,821
So how shall we pass the time?

70
00:07:25,855 --> 00:07:27,723
By putting one foot
in front of the other.

71
00:07:27,757 --> 00:07:30,092
It's going to be
a very dull walk.

72
00:07:30,126 --> 00:07:31,493
I'm here to take you
to King's Landing

73
00:07:31,528 --> 00:07:34,363
and bring back Lady Stark's
daughters in exchange.

74
00:07:34,397 --> 00:07:36,398
Dull is fine.

75
00:07:36,432 --> 00:07:39,200
You know, it doesn't matter
how loyal a servant you are,

76
00:07:39,234 --> 00:07:42,103
no one enjoys the company
of a humorless mute.

77
00:07:42,137 --> 00:07:43,571
Trust me on this.

78
00:07:43,605 --> 00:07:45,840
People have been serving me
since I was born.

79
00:07:45,874 --> 00:07:49,244
You think Lady Stark is going
to want a giant towheaded plank

80
00:07:49,278 --> 00:07:51,847
following her around
for the rest of her life?

81
00:07:51,881 --> 00:07:55,251
A week's journey with you and she'll
order you to fall on your sword.

82
00:07:55,285 --> 00:07:58,988
If Lady Stark is unhappy
with any aspect of my service,

83
00:07:59,056 --> 00:08:00,757
I'm sure she'll let me know.

84
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,291
She's an honest woman.

85
00:08:02,325 --> 00:08:04,293
All the good it's done her.

86
00:08:09,733 --> 00:08:13,069
How did you come into
Lady Stark's service?

87
00:08:13,103 --> 00:08:14,436
There's something
we can talk about.

88
00:08:14,471 --> 00:08:16,371
Not your concern, Kingslayer.

89
00:08:16,406 --> 00:08:17,973
It had to be recently.

90
00:08:18,007 --> 00:08:19,975
You weren't with her
at Winterfell.

91
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:21,409
How would you know?

92
00:08:21,444 --> 00:08:24,246
Because I visited Winterfell.

93
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,014
I would have noticed
your dour head

94
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:27,983
smacking into the archways.

95
00:08:28,017 --> 00:08:29,518
Move.

96
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:37,626
- Were you pledged to Stannis?
- Gods, no.

97
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,561
Ah, Renly.

98
00:08:39,596 --> 00:08:41,163
Really?

99
00:08:41,197 --> 00:08:42,898
He wasn't fit
to rule over anything

100
00:08:42,932 --> 00:08:44,766
more important than
a 12-course meal.

101
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,368
- Shut your mouth.
- Why?

102
00:08:46,402 --> 00:08:49,671
I lived with him at court since
he was a boy, don't forget.

103
00:08:49,705 --> 00:08:51,806
Could hardly escape
the little tulip.

104
00:08:51,841 --> 00:08:54,842
Skipping down the corridors
in his embroidered silks.

105
00:08:54,877 --> 00:08:56,711
I knew him far better than you.

106
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:58,713
I knew him as well as anyone.

107
00:08:58,748 --> 00:09:00,282
As a member of his Kingsguard,

108
00:09:00,316 --> 00:09:02,084
he trusted me with everything.

109
00:09:02,118 --> 00:09:03,518
He would have been
a wonderful king.

110
00:09:03,553 --> 00:09:05,020
Sounds like you
quite fancied him.

111
00:09:05,054 --> 00:09:07,289
I did not fancy him.

112
00:09:07,323 --> 00:09:08,958
Oh, gods, you did.

113
00:09:09,993 --> 00:09:11,827
<i>Did you ever tell him?</i>

114
00:09:11,861 --> 00:09:14,663
No, of course not.

115
00:09:14,697 --> 00:09:17,666
You weren't Renly's
type, I'm afraid.

116
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,537
He preferred curly-haired
little girls like Loras Tyrell.

117
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:22,938
You're far too much
man for him.

118
00:09:22,973 --> 00:09:24,773
I'm not interested
in foul rumors.

119
00:09:24,808 --> 00:09:26,809
Unless they're about me.

120
00:09:26,843 --> 00:09:29,178
It's all true about Renly.

121
00:09:29,213 --> 00:09:32,115
His proclivities were the
worst kept secret at court.

122
00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:34,484
It's a shame the throne
isn't made out of cocks.

123
00:09:34,518 --> 00:09:37,420
- They'd have never got him off it.
- Shut your mouth!

124
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,991
I don't blame him.

125
00:09:41,025 --> 00:09:43,026
And I don't blame you, either.

126
00:09:43,061 --> 00:09:46,263
We don't get to choose
who we love.

127
00:09:57,509 --> 00:10:00,277
- Where are you headed, then?
- South.

128
00:10:00,312 --> 00:10:02,346
- You?
- Riverrun.

129
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:05,516
Staying off
the kingsroad, are you?

130
00:10:05,551 --> 00:10:07,719
They get you no matter
where you go.

131
00:10:07,754 --> 00:10:09,388
- You can't win.
- No, you really can't.

132
00:10:09,422 --> 00:10:11,623
Looks like you're
safe enough, though.

133
00:10:11,658 --> 00:10:13,292
Meaning no offense,
my lady, but...

134
00:10:13,326 --> 00:10:15,727
I wouldn't
tangle with you.

135
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,798
- Seven blessings to you.
- And you.

136
00:10:26,973 --> 00:10:28,907
<i>He knows who I am.</i>

137
00:10:28,941 --> 00:10:30,375
- He doesn't.
- Maybe you're right.

138
00:10:30,409 --> 00:10:33,144
But what if you're not?
What if he tells someone?

139
00:10:35,648 --> 00:10:38,050
We're not doing it.

140
00:10:38,084 --> 00:10:40,319
<i>He's an innocent man.</i>

141
00:10:40,353 --> 00:10:42,888
More innocent than
Lady Stark's daughters?

142
00:10:54,533 --> 00:10:56,701
Make it tighter here.

143
00:10:57,803 --> 00:10:59,403
That's better.

144
00:11:00,772 --> 00:11:02,439
<i>It makes you look very strong.</i>

145
00:11:02,474 --> 00:11:04,475
No flowers.

146
00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:06,610
I said no flowers.

147
00:11:08,146 --> 00:11:10,113
All these are wrong.
Bring others.

148
00:11:10,147 --> 00:11:12,115
Yes, Your Grace.

149
00:11:13,283 --> 00:11:15,085
Bloody flowers.

150
00:11:15,119 --> 00:11:17,119
On the king.

151
00:11:17,154 --> 00:11:19,522
Looks like a Tyrell rose.

152
00:11:19,556 --> 00:11:22,391
Give it to Margaery
for her wedding gown.

153
00:11:22,425 --> 00:11:24,960
Should be more
than enough fabric.

154
00:11:29,966 --> 00:11:31,867
Tell me what you think of her.

155
00:11:31,901 --> 00:11:33,102
Who?

156
00:11:33,136 --> 00:11:35,171
Margaery.

157
00:11:35,205 --> 00:11:37,106
She's an ideal match.

158
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,075
With the Tyrells beside us,

159
00:11:39,109 --> 00:11:41,311
we'll crush the Northerners.

160
00:11:41,345 --> 00:11:44,514
Hang their lords,
burn their strongholds,

161
00:11:44,548 --> 00:11:46,082
sow their fields with salt,

162
00:11:46,116 --> 00:11:49,218
and no one will think of
rebelling for another century.

163
00:11:50,654 --> 00:11:53,856
It is a good match, but
what do you think of her?

164
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,929
She's beautiful
and intelligent.

165
00:11:59,963 --> 00:12:01,731
Yes, she is.

166
00:12:01,765 --> 00:12:05,535
Her concern with the well-being of
the common people is interesting.

167
00:12:05,602 --> 00:12:08,071
Not to me.

168
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,042
I only meant that to go out of
your way to endanger yourself--

169
00:12:12,076 --> 00:12:14,378
This is becoming
one of the most boring

170
00:12:14,412 --> 00:12:16,847
conversations I've ever had.

171
00:12:20,185 --> 00:12:24,088
Margaery Tyrell dotes on
filthy urchins for a reason.

172
00:12:24,122 --> 00:12:27,556
She dresses like
a harlot for a reason.

173
00:12:27,591 --> 00:12:29,890
She married a traitor
and known degenerate

174
00:12:29,924 --> 00:12:31,245
like Renly Baratheon
for a reason.

175
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:34,828
She married Renly Baratheon
because she was told to.

176
00:12:34,862 --> 00:12:37,530
That's what
intelligent women do--

177
00:12:37,564 --> 00:12:39,399
what they're told.

178
00:12:42,603 --> 00:12:46,204
- You need to ask yourself--
- I don't need to do anything.

179
00:12:57,748 --> 00:12:59,515
Better.

180
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,717
Much better.

181
00:13:02,752 --> 00:13:05,086
I still don't believe it.

182
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,854
He didn't.
He didn't want anything.

183
00:13:06,888 --> 00:13:10,557
He just takes an interest
because he loved my mother.

184
00:13:12,393 --> 00:13:15,528
Men only want one thing
from a pretty girl.

185
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:20,698
Littlefinger's not
in love with me.

186
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,268
Love is not the thing he wants.

187
00:13:27,203 --> 00:13:28,704
He's too old.

188
00:13:28,738 --> 00:13:30,906
They never see it that way.

189
00:13:34,443 --> 00:13:37,745
He didn't ask you
to do something for him?

190
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,980
Spy on someone or...?

191
00:13:40,015 --> 00:13:41,883
No.

192
00:13:47,622 --> 00:13:50,224
If he does ask you for anything

193
00:13:50,258 --> 00:13:52,226
or try anything

194
00:13:52,294 --> 00:13:55,596
or touch you,
I want you to tell me.

195
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:59,267
Why?
What will you do?

196
00:13:59,301 --> 00:14:00,935
I will make him stop.

197
00:14:03,372 --> 00:14:05,073
<i>Ser Loras Tyrell, my lady.</i>

198
00:14:05,107 --> 00:14:07,575
Send him in.

199
00:14:16,586 --> 00:14:18,253
Lady Sansa.

200
00:14:18,321 --> 00:14:19,654
Ser Loras.

201
00:14:19,689 --> 00:14:20,956
My sister Margaery
invites you to take

202
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,391
the air with her
and our grandmother

203
00:14:22,425 --> 00:14:24,793
the Lady Olenna in the gardens.

204
00:14:24,827 --> 00:14:27,529
May I escort you to them?

205
00:14:34,036 --> 00:14:37,038
I believe you grow more beautiful
every day, Lady Sansa.

206
00:14:37,072 --> 00:14:39,240
You are too kind, Ser Loras.

207
00:14:42,044 --> 00:14:45,213
You probably don't remember
the first time we met.

208
00:14:46,615 --> 00:14:49,618
At the Hand's tourney,
you gave me your favor.

209
00:14:50,854 --> 00:14:53,555
A rose, a red rose.

210
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,257
Of course I did.

211
00:14:57,961 --> 00:14:59,728
<i>It's more your color.</i>

212
00:14:59,763 --> 00:15:02,498
- You take it.
- Thank you.

213
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:04,400
You're such a dear.

214
00:15:04,435 --> 00:15:06,469
I'll take my leave.

215
00:15:06,503 --> 00:15:08,271
Lady Sansa.

216
00:15:08,305 --> 00:15:10,474
Thank you, Ser Loras.

217
00:15:10,508 --> 00:15:12,476
Come.

218
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,918
Lady Sansa, it is my honor

219
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:23,120
to present my grandmother...

220
00:15:24,289 --> 00:15:26,657
the Lady Olenna
of House Tyrell.

221
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,693
Kiss me, child.

222
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,762
It's so good of you to visit me

223
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:32,664
and my foolish flock of hens.

224
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:35,067
We're very sorry
for your losses.

225
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:38,770
And I was sorry when I heard of
Lord Renly's death, Lady Margaery.

226
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:41,006
- He was very gallant.
- Gallant, yes.

227
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,275
And charming and very clean.

228
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:45,210
He knew how to dress and smile

229
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:48,080
and somehow this gave him the
notion he was fit to be king.

230
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,115
Renly was brave
and gentle, Grandmother.

231
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,817
Father liked him
and so did Loras.

232
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:53,486
Loras is young and very good

233
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,455
at knocking men
off horses with a stick.

234
00:15:55,489 --> 00:15:58,157
That does not make him wise.

235
00:15:58,192 --> 00:15:59,559
As to your
fathead father--

236
00:15:59,593 --> 00:16:02,395
Grandmother! What will
Sansa think of us?

237
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:04,830
<i>She might think we have</i>
<i>some wits about us.</i>

238
00:16:04,865 --> 00:16:06,565
One of us, at any rate.

239
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:09,335
It was treason.
I warned them.

240
00:16:09,403 --> 00:16:12,305
Robert has two sons and
Renly has an older brother.

241
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:14,440
How could he possibly
have any claim

242
00:16:14,475 --> 00:16:17,076
to that ugly iron chair?

243
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:20,146
We should have stayed well out
of all this if you ask me.

244
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,048
But once the cow's been milked,

245
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:24,651
there's no squirting
the cream back up her udders.

246
00:16:24,685 --> 00:16:26,721
So here we are
to see things through.

247
00:16:26,755 --> 00:16:29,358
What do you say to that, Sansa?

248
00:16:30,493 --> 00:16:32,428
Shall we have some lemon cakes?

249
00:16:32,462 --> 00:16:34,029
Lemon cake's my favorite.

250
00:16:34,064 --> 00:16:36,198
So we've been told.

251
00:16:36,233 --> 00:16:39,735
Are you going to bring the food or
do you mean to starve us to death?

252
00:16:40,637 --> 00:16:42,571
Here, Sansa,

253
00:16:42,605 --> 00:16:44,707
come sit with me.

254
00:16:44,741 --> 00:16:48,177
I'm much less boring
than these others.

255
00:16:50,347 --> 00:16:52,949
Do you know my son?

256
00:16:52,983 --> 00:16:54,817
The Lord of Highgarden?

257
00:16:54,852 --> 00:16:57,053
I haven't had the pleasure.

258
00:16:57,121 --> 00:16:59,055
No great pleasure, believe me.

259
00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:00,590
A ponderous oaf.

260
00:17:00,624 --> 00:17:02,625
<i>His father was an oaf as well.</i>

261
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,428
<i>My husband,</i>
<i>the late Lord Luthor.</i>

262
00:17:05,463 --> 00:17:08,364
He managed to ride off
a cliff whilst hawking.

263
00:17:08,399 --> 00:17:10,567
They say he was looking
up at the sky

264
00:17:10,601 --> 00:17:14,104
and paying no mind to where
his horse was taking him.

265
00:17:14,138 --> 00:17:16,139
And now my son
is doing the same,

266
00:17:16,173 --> 00:17:19,843
only this time he's riding
a lion instead of a horse.

267
00:17:19,878 --> 00:17:22,446
Now...

268
00:17:22,514 --> 00:17:24,849
I want you to tell me the truth

269
00:17:24,884 --> 00:17:28,820
about this royal boy,
this Joffrey.

270
00:17:28,854 --> 00:17:31,022
I... I...

271
00:17:31,057 --> 00:17:32,491
You, you.

272
00:17:32,525 --> 00:17:34,259
Who else would know better?

273
00:17:34,294 --> 00:17:37,096
We've heard
some troubling tales.

274
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,865
Is there any truth to them?

275
00:17:39,899 --> 00:17:42,301
<i>Has this boy mistreated you?</i>

276
00:17:42,335 --> 00:17:44,670
Has he ripped out your tongue?

277
00:17:44,705 --> 00:17:47,139
Joff-- King Joffrey,

278
00:17:47,173 --> 00:17:50,409
he-- His Grace
is very fair

279
00:17:50,443 --> 00:17:53,512
and handsome
and as brave as a lion.

280
00:17:53,546 --> 00:17:56,148
Yes, all Lannisters are lions.

281
00:17:56,182 --> 00:17:59,885
And when a Tyrell farts,
it smells like a rose.

282
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,187
<i>But how kind is he?</i>
<i>How clever?</i>

283
00:18:02,221 --> 00:18:04,723
Has he a good heart,
a gentle hand?

284
00:18:04,757 --> 00:18:06,191
I'm to be his wife.

285
00:18:06,225 --> 00:18:08,426
I only want to know
what that means.

286
00:18:16,001 --> 00:18:17,769
Bring me some cheese.

287
00:18:17,803 --> 00:18:20,171
The cheese will be served
after the cakes, my lady.

288
00:18:20,238 --> 00:18:22,506
The cheese will be served
when I want it served.

289
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:24,108
And I want it served now.

290
00:18:28,213 --> 00:18:30,314
Are you frightened, child?

291
00:18:30,382 --> 00:18:32,249
No need for that.

292
00:18:32,283 --> 00:18:34,184
We're only women here.

293
00:18:34,219 --> 00:18:37,521
Tell us the truth.
No harm will come to you.

294
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:41,558
My father always
told the truth.

295
00:18:41,593 --> 00:18:43,660
Yes, he had that reputation.

296
00:18:43,695 --> 00:18:46,129
And they named him traitor
and took his head.

297
00:18:46,164 --> 00:18:49,066
Joffrey.

298
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,001
Joffrey did that.

299
00:18:51,036 --> 00:18:54,405
He promised he would be merciful
and he cut my father's head off.

300
00:18:54,439 --> 00:18:56,240
And he said that was mercy.

301
00:18:56,275 --> 00:19:00,110
Then he took me up on the
walls and made me look at it.

302
00:19:03,748 --> 00:19:06,150
Go on.

303
00:19:07,185 --> 00:19:10,287
I-- I can't.
I never meant--

304
00:19:10,321 --> 00:19:12,523
my father was a traitor.

305
00:19:12,557 --> 00:19:14,992
My brother as well.
I have traitor's blood.

306
00:19:15,026 --> 00:19:16,694
Please don't make me
say anymore.

307
00:19:16,728 --> 00:19:18,228
She's terrified, Grandmother.

308
00:19:18,263 --> 00:19:21,699
- Just look at her.
- Speak freely, child.

309
00:19:21,733 --> 00:19:25,536
We would never betray your
confidence, I swear it.

310
00:19:27,772 --> 00:19:30,407
He's a monster.

311
00:19:31,643 --> 00:19:33,410
Ah.

312
00:19:33,445 --> 00:19:35,379
<i>That's a pity.</i>

313
00:19:35,447 --> 00:19:37,815
Please, don't stop the wedding.

314
00:19:37,849 --> 00:19:40,517
Have no fear.
The Lord Oaf of Highgarden

315
00:19:40,551 --> 00:19:43,386
<i>is determined that</i>
<i>Margaery shall be queen.</i>

316
00:19:43,421 --> 00:19:46,890
Even so, we thank you
for the truth.

317
00:19:46,924 --> 00:19:49,726
Ah, here comes my cheese.

318
00:20:05,477 --> 00:20:06,943
<i>We're at war.</i>

319
00:20:06,978 --> 00:20:09,513
<i>This march is a distraction.</i>

320
00:20:09,547 --> 00:20:12,716
My grandfather's funeral
is not a distraction.

321
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,719
- Are we riding to battle at Riverrun?
- No.

322
00:20:15,753 --> 00:20:17,787
Then it's a distraction.

323
00:20:17,822 --> 00:20:20,890
My Uncle Edmure has his
forces garrisoned there.

324
00:20:20,925 --> 00:20:22,792
We need his men.

325
00:20:22,826 --> 00:20:25,128
Unless he's been breeding them,

326
00:20:25,162 --> 00:20:27,130
he don't have enough
to make a difference.

327
00:20:27,164 --> 00:20:29,766
Have you lost faith
in our cause?

328
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,403
If it's revenge,
I still got faith in it.

329
00:20:33,437 --> 00:20:35,304
If you no longer
believe--

330
00:20:35,339 --> 00:20:37,973
I can believe
till it snows in Dorne.

331
00:20:38,008 --> 00:20:41,611
Don't change the fact
that we've got half the men.

332
00:20:43,246 --> 00:20:46,015
You don't think we can win?

333
00:20:46,049 --> 00:20:48,184
May I speak my mind,
Your Grace?

334
00:20:48,218 --> 00:20:51,687
Have you not been speaking
your mind, Lord Karstark?

335
00:20:51,721 --> 00:20:54,623
I think you lost this war

336
00:20:54,658 --> 00:20:56,826
the day you married her.

337
00:21:06,104 --> 00:21:08,272
Whoa, whoa.

338
00:21:10,075 --> 00:21:11,375
Your Grace.

339
00:21:11,409 --> 00:21:14,011
You're afraid of her.

340
00:21:14,046 --> 00:21:16,748
- And she knows it.
- I'm not afraid of her.

341
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:28,959
May I help you, Lady Stark?

342
00:21:29,027 --> 00:21:30,628
No.

343
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,164
I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have--

344
00:21:33,232 --> 00:21:34,699
You can't help because a mother

345
00:21:34,733 --> 00:21:37,903
makes one for her
children to protect them.

346
00:21:39,639 --> 00:21:41,840
Only a mother can make them.

347
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,781
You've made them before?

348
00:21:52,217 --> 00:21:54,484
Twice.

349
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:56,653
Did they work?

350
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:00,824
After a fashion.

351
00:22:03,327 --> 00:22:07,097
I prayed for my son Bran
to survive his fall.

352
00:22:11,202 --> 00:22:12,803
Many years before that,

353
00:22:12,837 --> 00:22:15,339
one of the boys came down
with the pox.

354
00:22:17,142 --> 00:22:19,544
Maester Luwin said if he made it
through the night, he'd live.

355
00:22:19,578 --> 00:22:23,381
But it would be
a very long night.

356
00:22:25,818 --> 00:22:29,321
So I sat with him
all through the darkness.

357
00:22:30,523 --> 00:22:33,859
Listened to his ragged
little breaths,

358
00:22:33,893 --> 00:22:36,729
his coughing, his whimpering.

359
00:22:36,763 --> 00:22:38,864
<i>Which boy?</i>

360
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:42,034
Jon Snow.

361
00:22:44,271 --> 00:22:46,672
When my husband brought
that baby home from the war,

362
00:22:46,707 --> 00:22:49,175
I couldn't bear to look at him.

363
00:22:50,344 --> 00:22:51,644
I didn't want
to see those brown

364
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,948
<i>stranger's eyes</i>
<i>staring up at me.</i>

365
00:22:55,016 --> 00:22:57,919
<i>So I prayed to the gods,</i>
<i>take him away.</i>

366
00:22:57,953 --> 00:23:00,454
Make him die.

367
00:23:02,624 --> 00:23:04,424
He got the pox.

368
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:11,499
<i>And I knew I was the worst</i>
<i>woman who ever lived.</i>

369
00:23:13,401 --> 00:23:15,536
A murderer.

370
00:23:16,939 --> 00:23:19,807
I'd condemned this poor,
innocent child

371
00:23:19,841 --> 00:23:22,276
to a horrible death

372
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:24,845
all because I was
jealous of his mother.

373
00:23:25,881 --> 00:23:28,282
A woman he didn't even know.

374
00:23:28,317 --> 00:23:31,486
So I prayed to all seven gods,

375
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,689
let the boy live.

376
00:23:34,723 --> 00:23:37,158
Let him live

377
00:23:37,193 --> 00:23:39,226
and I'll love him.

378
00:23:39,261 --> 00:23:42,563
I'll be a mother to him.

379
00:23:42,598 --> 00:23:46,334
I'll beg my husband
to give him a true name,

380
00:23:46,369 --> 00:23:49,304
to call him Stark
and be done with it,

381
00:23:49,339 --> 00:23:50,906
to make him one of us.

382
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,208
And he lived.

383
00:23:53,242 --> 00:23:55,044
And he lived.

384
00:23:57,947 --> 00:24:00,382
And I couldn't keep my promise.

385
00:24:04,821 --> 00:24:07,456
<i>And everything</i>
<i>that's happened since then...</i>

386
00:24:09,259 --> 00:24:12,261
<i>all this horror</i>
<i>that's come to my family...</i>

387
00:24:14,497 --> 00:24:18,534
it's all because I couldn't
love a motherless child.

388
00:24:28,979 --> 00:24:31,815
Was it hard for you
to kill the Halfhand?

389
00:24:33,852 --> 00:24:35,486
Yes.

390
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,955
You liked him?

391
00:24:37,989 --> 00:24:40,657
I like you, but if
you're playing us false,

392
00:24:40,692 --> 00:24:42,626
it won't be hard
for me to kill you.

393
00:24:42,661 --> 00:24:44,395
I've got wildling
blood in my veins.

394
00:24:44,429 --> 00:24:47,498
- These are my people.
- I understand.

395
00:24:47,532 --> 00:24:50,434
Well, how could you understand?

396
00:24:50,469 --> 00:24:52,736
You want to protect
your people.

397
00:24:52,771 --> 00:24:55,939
Do you know what it takes
to unite 90 clans,

398
00:24:55,974 --> 00:24:58,242
half of whom want
to massacre the other half

399
00:24:58,276 --> 00:25:00,678
for one insult or another?

400
00:25:00,712 --> 00:25:04,482
They speak seven different
languages in my army.

401
00:25:04,549 --> 00:25:06,484
<i>The Thenns hate the Hornfoots.</i>

402
00:25:06,518 --> 00:25:08,419
<i>The Hornfoots hate</i>
<i>the ice-river clans.</i>

403
00:25:08,453 --> 00:25:11,055
Everyone hates the cave people.

404
00:25:11,089 --> 00:25:14,458
So you know how I got
moon worshippers

405
00:25:14,492 --> 00:25:16,627
and cannibals and giants

406
00:25:16,662 --> 00:25:18,930
to march together
in the same army?

407
00:25:18,964 --> 00:25:20,331
No.

408
00:25:20,365 --> 00:25:23,201
I told them we were
all going to die

409
00:25:23,235 --> 00:25:25,203
if we don't get south.

410
00:25:25,237 --> 00:25:27,372
Because that's the truth.

411
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:41,052
Shouldn't be long now.

412
00:25:52,031 --> 00:25:54,433
What's wrong with him?

413
00:25:54,467 --> 00:25:56,568
<i>He's a warg.</i>

414
00:25:56,603 --> 00:25:59,672
He can enter the mind of
animals, see through their eyes.

415
00:25:59,706 --> 00:26:01,206
He's scouting for us.

416
00:26:01,274 --> 00:26:03,909
What, you've never met a warg?

417
00:26:13,585 --> 00:26:15,086
<i>Orell.</i>

418
00:26:24,062 --> 00:26:27,498
Where were you this time?

419
00:26:32,271 --> 00:26:34,772
The Fist of the First Men.

420
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,209
What did you see?

421
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,748
Dead crows.

422
00:26:53,058 --> 00:26:54,525
What's the matter, Piggy?

423
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,527
You crying 'cause you're cold?

424
00:26:59,432 --> 00:27:03,168
There's 200 brothers
killed by dead men

425
00:27:03,202 --> 00:27:05,703
and you're still here

426
00:27:05,738 --> 00:27:08,273
whimpering.

427
00:27:08,307 --> 00:27:10,508
That seem fair to you?

428
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:13,645
I seen 'em torn
to pieces fighting

429
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,380
while you was off somewhere
hiding in a hole.

430
00:27:17,883 --> 00:27:20,384
Why don't you lie down
and rest for a while, eh?

431
00:27:21,753 --> 00:27:24,055
You know you want to.

432
00:27:40,904 --> 00:27:42,804
Hey.

433
00:27:48,077 --> 00:27:49,811
Get up, Sam.

434
00:27:49,846 --> 00:27:52,481
- No.
- <i>Get up.</i>

435
00:27:52,515 --> 00:27:54,082
I can't.

436
00:27:54,116 --> 00:27:56,651
If you stop, you'll die.

437
00:27:56,685 --> 00:28:00,387
'Course if you don't stop,
you'll probably die, too.

438
00:28:00,455 --> 00:28:03,690
- You don't care.
- 'Course we care.

439
00:28:03,725 --> 00:28:05,993
You left me.

440
00:28:06,027 --> 00:28:09,429
When the white walkers came,
you left me.

441
00:28:09,464 --> 00:28:12,099
Aye, we left you.

442
00:28:12,167 --> 00:28:14,468
<i>You're fat and you're slow.</i>

443
00:28:14,503 --> 00:28:16,704
We didn't want to die.

444
00:28:18,307 --> 00:28:20,308
Help me get him up.

445
00:28:21,543 --> 00:28:23,110
Looks like that piggy
is done for.

446
00:28:23,144 --> 00:28:25,279
- Help us get him up.
- He's slowing us down.

447
00:28:25,347 --> 00:28:26,914
Just get him up!

448
00:28:26,949 --> 00:28:30,017
Why? So the rest
of us can die?

449
00:28:31,553 --> 00:28:33,821
We'll move faster without him.

450
00:28:33,855 --> 00:28:37,291
What is this?
Get up, Tarly.

451
00:28:38,994 --> 00:28:41,229
- Is he all right?
- Aye, I think so.

452
00:28:41,263 --> 00:28:43,030
If he can't, we may as
well just go without him.

453
00:28:43,064 --> 00:28:44,932
That's enough.

454
00:28:44,966 --> 00:28:47,001
Tarly,

455
00:28:47,035 --> 00:28:49,369
I forbid you to die.

456
00:28:49,404 --> 00:28:51,639
Do you hear me?

457
00:28:51,673 --> 00:28:54,374
- Why should the rest of us--
- Rast...

458
00:28:54,409 --> 00:28:56,877
you're responsible for him.

459
00:28:56,911 --> 00:28:58,945
What am I supposed to do?

460
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,014
Make sure he gets back alive.

461
00:29:01,082 --> 00:29:03,816
If he doesn't, you don't.

462
00:29:04,718 --> 00:29:06,719
Move on!

463
00:29:12,526 --> 00:29:14,894
I'm not dying for you, Piggy.

464
00:29:14,929 --> 00:29:16,763
You hear me?

465
00:29:42,057 --> 00:29:44,025
Where's Rickon and Hodor?

466
00:29:44,059 --> 00:29:47,362
Looking for food.

467
00:29:49,198 --> 00:29:52,000
What's out there?

468
00:30:41,218 --> 00:30:43,652
<i>Not another step, boy.</i>

469
00:30:43,687 --> 00:30:45,822
<i>Unless you want to drown</i>
<i>in your own blood.</i>

470
00:30:45,856 --> 00:30:47,223
I'm unarmed.

471
00:30:47,291 --> 00:30:50,092
That was poor planning.

472
00:30:50,127 --> 00:30:52,328
My sister carries the weapons.

473
00:30:53,964 --> 00:30:56,866
I'm better with them.

474
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,235
<i>Drop the spear.</i>

475
00:31:01,738 --> 00:31:03,839
<i>Drop it.</i>

476
00:31:06,509 --> 00:31:08,310
If you kill me,

477
00:31:08,344 --> 00:31:10,980
that wolf will tear
you to bits.

478
00:31:16,553 --> 00:31:19,456
You must be Summer.

479
00:31:42,414 --> 00:31:44,783
I'm Jojen Reed.

480
00:31:44,817 --> 00:31:47,886
This is my sister Meera.

481
00:31:51,925 --> 00:31:54,593
We've come a long way
to find you, Brandon.

482
00:31:55,762 --> 00:31:58,532
And we have much farther to go.

483
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,871
I'm just
trying to understand.

484
00:32:03,905 --> 00:32:06,740
Would you please
shut up about it?

485
00:32:06,775 --> 00:32:08,475
Jaqen H'ghar offered
you three kills.

486
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:10,710
- I'm not listening.
- But just explain it to me.

487
00:32:10,745 --> 00:32:13,447
He offered to kill
any three people you wanted.

488
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:16,183
Dead. All you had to do
was give him the names.

489
00:32:16,217 --> 00:32:18,919
Anyone. You could have
picked King Joffrey.

490
00:32:18,953 --> 00:32:20,987
- Shut up.
- You could have picked Tywin Lannister.

491
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,489
Jaqen got us out of Harrenhal,

492
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:24,257
so why are you complaining?

493
00:32:24,292 --> 00:32:26,093
But you could have
ended the war.

494
00:32:26,127 --> 00:32:28,862
- Where are we going?
- North.

495
00:32:28,896 --> 00:32:30,297
If we were going north,

496
00:32:30,331 --> 00:32:31,965
we should have come to the
Red Fork River by now.

497
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,134
Maybe we already passed it.

498
00:32:34,168 --> 00:32:35,802
It's 100 feet wide.

499
00:32:35,837 --> 00:32:38,070
How could we have passed it?

500
00:32:39,139 --> 00:32:40,539
If we hit the Red Fork,

501
00:32:40,574 --> 00:32:42,041
we can follow it west
to Riverrun.

502
00:32:42,076 --> 00:32:43,576
My mother grew up there.

503
00:32:43,611 --> 00:32:45,945
My grandfather's a lord.
He'll protect us.

504
00:32:48,916 --> 00:32:50,483
Could be a minstrel.

505
00:32:50,517 --> 00:32:52,652

00:33:46,541 --> 00:33:49,110
You go on down the road.

521
00:33:49,144 --> 00:33:51,112
Just keep on singing
so we know where you are.

522
00:33:51,146 --> 00:33:54,749
Leave us be
and I won't kill you.

523
00:33:57,753 --> 00:33:59,387
Generous.

524
00:33:59,421 --> 00:34:01,890
You're a dangerous person.

525
00:34:01,924 --> 00:34:04,760
I like dangerous people.

526
00:34:07,063 --> 00:34:09,465
Why are your friends so shy?

527
00:34:10,868 --> 00:34:12,635
What friends?

528
00:34:12,669 --> 00:34:15,906
The fat one to your left
and the lad beside him.

529
00:34:36,795 --> 00:34:38,796
Three young ones on the run

530
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:42,300
carrying
castle-forged swords.

531
00:34:42,334 --> 00:34:43,834
You escape from Harrenhal?

532
00:34:43,869 --> 00:34:46,470
<i>- Who are you?</i>
- Thoros of Myr.

533
00:34:46,504 --> 00:34:48,539
And the fellow here
with the bow is Anguy.

534
00:34:48,607 --> 00:34:49,974
No, who do you fight for?

535
00:34:50,008 --> 00:34:52,043
<i>The Brotherhood</i>
<i>without Banners.</i>

536
00:34:54,313 --> 00:34:56,614
Now come along.

537
00:34:56,648 --> 00:34:58,249
I want to hear how two boys

538
00:34:58,284 --> 00:35:01,820
and a very dangerous girl
escaped Harrenhal.

539
00:35:01,854 --> 00:35:04,523
I'm not going with them.
The Brotherhood?

540
00:35:04,557 --> 00:35:07,093
That's who the Mountain
and them lot were looking for.

541
00:35:07,127 --> 00:35:08,928
They'll bring us back
and put rats in us.

542
00:35:08,962 --> 00:35:10,962
You've got nothing
to fear from us, son.

543
00:35:10,997 --> 00:35:13,798
The lords of Westeros
want to burn the countryside.

544
00:35:13,833 --> 00:35:15,733
We're trying to save it.

545
00:35:15,768 --> 00:35:17,369
Now come on.

546
00:35:17,403 --> 00:35:20,104
We'll talk some more
over brown bread and stew.

547
00:35:20,138 --> 00:35:22,239
And then you can go
on your way.

548
00:35:29,681 --> 00:35:31,883
Here's the thing, fat boy.

549
00:35:35,455 --> 00:35:36,722
When I'm done talking,

550
00:35:36,756 --> 00:35:39,659
that arrow's falling down
on your fat head.

551
00:35:39,693 --> 00:35:43,061
So I advise you move,
because I'm done talking.

552
00:35:58,143 --> 00:36:01,411
Half the country's starving
and look at this one.

553
00:36:01,446 --> 00:36:03,914
Maybe he's the reason
half the country's starving.

554
00:36:13,258 --> 00:36:15,793
My lion.

555
00:36:15,827 --> 00:36:19,530
We've spoken of this.

556
00:36:19,565 --> 00:36:22,266
You cannot come here.

557
00:36:25,137 --> 00:36:28,039
But you said I should come
to you with any problems.

558
00:36:28,073 --> 00:36:29,874
Did anyone see you?

559
00:36:29,908 --> 00:36:32,076
- No.
- You sure?

560
00:36:32,111 --> 00:36:34,412
My father does not
make idle threats.

561
00:36:34,447 --> 00:36:37,783
Having you killed would be
the high point of his week.

562
00:36:37,817 --> 00:36:39,819
You have to be
absolutely certain.

563
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:45,525
All right.

564
00:36:45,559 --> 00:36:47,560
What is this problem?

565
00:36:49,329 --> 00:36:51,430
I'm worried about Sansa.

566
00:36:51,465 --> 00:36:53,298
When she spoke
with Lord Baelish,

567
00:36:53,333 --> 00:36:56,769
his friend warned me about him.

568
00:36:56,803 --> 00:36:58,904
Baelish doesn't have friends.

569
00:37:00,073 --> 00:37:01,674
I don't know her name.

570
00:37:01,708 --> 00:37:04,843
- Oh, Ros? The redhead?
- How do you know her?

571
00:37:04,878 --> 00:37:07,079
I try to know
as many people as I can.

572
00:37:07,113 --> 00:37:08,881
You never know
which one you'll need.

573
00:37:08,915 --> 00:37:10,649
She's a whore.

574
00:37:10,684 --> 00:37:13,785
Yes, well, we shouldn't be
judgmental about these things.

575
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:17,122
- You fucked her.
- Oh, please.

576
00:37:17,157 --> 00:37:19,892
All right, yes,
I fucked her once.

577
00:37:22,195 --> 00:37:23,528
Twice.

578
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:27,632
But since I met you, my lady,

579
00:37:27,666 --> 00:37:30,134
I've been with no one else.

580
00:37:32,238 --> 00:37:35,273
And was she good?
Did you like her?

581
00:37:35,307 --> 00:37:37,008
Not as much
as I like you, obviously,

582
00:37:37,076 --> 00:37:39,811
or she'd be the one
torturing me right now.

583
00:37:42,915 --> 00:37:45,517
What did she say
about Littlefinger?

584
00:37:48,087 --> 00:37:49,821
That Sansa shouldn't trust him.

585
00:37:49,856 --> 00:37:52,758
Is there an idiot
in any village

586
00:37:52,792 --> 00:37:54,760
who trusts Littlefinger?

587
00:37:57,263 --> 00:37:59,097
We have to protect her.

588
00:37:59,131 --> 00:38:00,332
We can't.

589
00:38:00,366 --> 00:38:03,301
Now that the Lannisters
have discarded her,

590
00:38:03,369 --> 00:38:05,737
Sansa will have many suitors.

591
00:38:05,771 --> 00:38:09,007
A great beauty
with a very old name.

592
00:38:09,041 --> 00:38:12,177
A great beauty?
Oh, a great beauty?

593
00:38:12,211 --> 00:38:15,280
Yes, she is, objectively, very.

594
00:38:15,314 --> 00:38:17,849
Her face
is quite pleasing--

595
00:38:17,883 --> 00:38:19,551
to other men and to women,

596
00:38:19,585 --> 00:38:21,453
people in general.

597
00:38:21,487 --> 00:38:23,422
But not to me, of course.

598
00:38:23,456 --> 00:38:26,625
I only have eyes for you.

599
00:38:26,659 --> 00:38:29,294
You pervert.
You want her?

600
00:38:29,329 --> 00:38:32,497
- This child?
- I don't even want to talk about her.

601
00:38:32,532 --> 00:38:35,267
- But you are.
- Only because you're making me.

602
00:38:35,301 --> 00:38:38,803
I didn't force
you to open your mouth

603
00:38:38,838 --> 00:38:40,872
and make words come out.

604
00:38:40,907 --> 00:38:44,109
This is cruel and unfair.
Cruelly unfair.

605
00:38:44,143 --> 00:38:45,877
"Oh, the cruelty.

606
00:38:45,912 --> 00:38:48,347
Shae is so cruel to me."

607
00:38:50,516 --> 00:38:52,484
Hmm, yes.

608
00:39:01,494 --> 00:39:03,762
Now do you think I'm cruel?

609
00:39:04,897 --> 00:39:06,564
Only if you stop.

610
00:39:08,701 --> 00:39:11,404
But you mustn't
come here again.

611
00:39:14,174 --> 00:39:16,409
Do you hear me?

612
00:39:18,045 --> 00:39:20,380
You've come to
a dangerous place

613
00:39:20,414 --> 00:39:22,949
full of dangerous people.

614
00:39:25,152 --> 00:39:28,154
Dangerous people.

615
00:39:37,765 --> 00:39:39,465
<i>Lady Tyrell, my king.</i>

616
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,367
Send her in.

617
00:39:56,017 --> 00:39:58,418
You wanted to see me,
Your Grace?

618
00:39:58,453 --> 00:40:00,187
I'm leaving on a hunting trip.

619
00:40:00,221 --> 00:40:02,589
I just wanted to make sure

620
00:40:02,624 --> 00:40:04,491
you had everything
you need before I left.

621
00:40:04,525 --> 00:40:06,760
That's very thoughtful,
Your Grace.

622
00:40:06,794 --> 00:40:08,562
I have everything I could want.

623
00:40:08,596 --> 00:40:09,797
Good. Good.

624
00:40:09,831 --> 00:40:12,533
How are you finding life
in the capital?

625
00:40:12,567 --> 00:40:15,235
It must be quite a change
after Renly's camp.

626
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:17,137
A welcome one.

627
00:40:17,172 --> 00:40:21,508
A military encampment
is no place for a lady.

628
00:40:21,543 --> 00:40:23,944
And the bedside of a traitor?

629
00:40:26,414 --> 00:40:29,015
Is that a place for a lady?

630
00:40:29,884 --> 00:40:32,986
Your Grace,

631
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:35,956
I tried to do my duty
as a wife, that is all.

632
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:39,559
What was your duty to this
traitor as you saw it?

633
00:40:39,627 --> 00:40:41,795
The duty of any wife
to any husband--

634
00:40:41,829 --> 00:40:43,529
to provide him with children.

635
00:40:43,564 --> 00:40:45,631
<i>You failed to do this.</i>

636
00:40:45,666 --> 00:40:48,868
- Why?
- <i>I--</i>

637
00:40:51,071 --> 00:40:53,872
I would not speak ill
of the dead, Your Grace.

638
00:40:53,906 --> 00:40:55,840
You think one ought
to speak kindly

639
00:40:55,875 --> 00:40:58,677
of a traitor merely because he's
had a sword put through his heart?

640
00:40:58,711 --> 00:41:00,545
No.

641
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:03,415
I do beg your pardon.

642
00:41:03,449 --> 00:41:06,718
The subtleties of politics
are often lost on me.

643
00:41:06,752 --> 00:41:09,154
Renly...

644
00:41:10,923 --> 00:41:13,658
I don't believe
he was interested

645
00:41:13,693 --> 00:41:16,094
<i>in the company of women.</i>

646
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:19,564
What makes you say this?

647
00:41:20,967 --> 00:41:24,837
Whenever I wanted
to make a child with him,

648
00:41:24,871 --> 00:41:27,306
he--

649
00:41:27,341 --> 00:41:29,375
he had so many excuses,

650
00:41:29,409 --> 00:41:31,544
so many late-night
war councils.

651
00:41:31,578 --> 00:41:33,913
He never wanted to try.

652
00:41:35,282 --> 00:41:38,050
Except one evening,

653
00:41:38,084 --> 00:41:40,886
after he'd had far too
much wine to drink,

654
00:41:40,921 --> 00:41:43,389
he suggested something--

655
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:50,429
something that sounded
very painful

656
00:41:50,496 --> 00:41:52,564
and couldn't possibly
result in children.

657
00:41:54,701 --> 00:41:56,501
Maybe the fault was with me.

658
00:41:56,536 --> 00:41:59,571
No, he was a known...

659
00:41:59,605 --> 00:42:01,173
degenerate.

660
00:42:02,608 --> 00:42:04,642
It's such a relief to hear
you say so, Your Grace.

661
00:42:04,676 --> 00:42:06,377
Mmm.

662
00:42:06,411 --> 00:42:09,113
I've considered
making his perversion

663
00:42:09,147 --> 00:42:11,148
punishable by death.

664
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:15,318
As is your right.

665
00:42:15,353 --> 00:42:18,922
You must do whatever
you need to do.

666
00:42:22,759 --> 00:42:24,160
You are the king.

667
00:42:24,194 --> 00:42:26,396
Yes.

668
00:42:29,133 --> 00:42:30,834
I am.

669
00:42:36,975 --> 00:42:38,442
Do you like it?

670
00:42:38,476 --> 00:42:40,377
I just had it made.

671
00:42:40,412 --> 00:42:43,180
Probably one of the finest
weapons in the Seven Kingdoms.

672
00:42:43,214 --> 00:42:44,615
It's beautiful.

673
00:42:44,649 --> 00:42:46,850
Will you show me how it works?

674
00:42:51,089 --> 00:42:52,623
It's a new design.

675
00:42:52,658 --> 00:42:55,092
Much easier to load.
There's no crank.

676
00:42:55,126 --> 00:42:59,096
You use this lever
to draw the string.

677
00:43:04,535 --> 00:43:06,704
The bolt goes here.

678
00:43:09,073 --> 00:43:12,743
And then you just aim...

679
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:17,081
and...

680
00:43:20,852 --> 00:43:24,588
Would you take me
hunting sometime?

681
00:43:24,622 --> 00:43:26,556
Forgive me, Your Grace.

682
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:28,725
I know a hunt
is no place for a woman.

683
00:43:28,759 --> 00:43:30,327
It's not unheard of.

684
00:43:30,361 --> 00:43:32,663
My father would never
let me before--

685
00:43:32,697 --> 00:43:35,098
You no longer belong to him.

686
00:43:36,133 --> 00:43:38,068
Do you want to hold it?

687
00:43:38,102 --> 00:43:40,170
May I?
Please.

688
00:43:47,813 --> 00:43:50,148
I imagine it must be
so exciting

689
00:43:50,182 --> 00:43:52,183
to squeeze your finger here

690
00:43:52,217 --> 00:43:54,886
and watch something
die over there.

691
00:43:58,924 --> 00:44:01,425
Could you do it?

692
00:44:01,459 --> 00:44:03,460
Could you...

693
00:44:03,494 --> 00:44:05,796
kill something?

694
00:44:07,265 --> 00:44:09,466
I don't know, Your Grace.
Do you think I could?

695
00:44:09,501 --> 00:44:11,835
Yes.

696
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:14,271
Would you like to watch me?

697
00:44:18,310 --> 00:44:20,211
Yes.

698
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:24,482
Stop! Stop!

699
00:44:24,516 --> 00:44:26,885
- <i>Tell us the truth.</i>
- About what?

700
00:44:28,354 --> 00:44:30,856
I don't
know what you want.

701
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:33,124
I want the truth.

702
00:44:33,159 --> 00:44:34,926
What truth?

703
00:44:34,961 --> 00:44:36,928
Why'd you take Winterfell?

704
00:44:36,962 --> 00:44:39,364
I took it to--
I took it--

705
00:44:39,398 --> 00:44:40,799
- Who gave the orders?
- No one.

706
00:44:40,833 --> 00:44:42,367
- I took it on my own.
- <i>Why?</i>

707
00:44:42,401 --> 00:44:44,402
To take the North
while it was vulnerable.

708
00:44:44,437 --> 00:44:46,171
What were you going
to do once you took it?

709
00:44:46,205 --> 00:44:47,939
Hold it.
Rule it.

710
00:44:47,973 --> 00:44:51,676
Good.
That's very good.

711
00:44:56,648 --> 00:44:58,349
Why did you do that?
I told you.

712
00:44:58,384 --> 00:45:00,018
Why did you take Winterfell?

713
00:45:00,052 --> 00:45:03,320
I took it to bring glory
to my house and my father.

714
00:45:11,096 --> 00:45:13,097
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

715
00:45:13,132 --> 00:45:16,567
I took it because
I hated the Starks.

716
00:45:16,602 --> 00:45:18,970
I hated them
for holding me prisoner.

717
00:45:19,004 --> 00:45:21,439
I wanted to hurt them.

718
00:45:27,245 --> 00:45:29,313
What are you doing?

719
00:45:32,350 --> 00:45:34,485
Please.

720
00:45:39,558 --> 00:45:42,392
I'll tell you anything.

721
00:45:42,427 --> 00:45:44,428
Just take it off.

722
00:45:44,462 --> 00:45:47,564
<i>Please.</i>
<i>Please, just take it off.</i>

723
00:45:56,707 --> 00:45:59,876
- Your sister sent me.
- Yara?

724
00:46:06,985 --> 00:46:09,487
I'll come for you tonight
when the castle sleeps.

725
00:46:09,521 --> 00:46:11,556
No, don't go.
Please, please.

726
00:46:11,590 --> 00:46:13,258
No, please don't leave me.

727
00:46:13,292 --> 00:46:14,993
Please, please.

728
00:46:15,027 --> 00:46:16,428
Please, please don't go!

729
00:46:16,462 --> 00:46:21,167
Please. Please.
Don't leave me.

730
00:46:21,201 --> 00:46:23,869
Please don't go.

731
00:46:28,608 --> 00:46:30,742
Rickon, stay with us.

732
00:46:32,077 --> 00:46:35,513
It's all right.
The wolves will protect him.

733
00:46:44,857 --> 00:46:46,792
You can get inside his head,

734
00:46:46,826 --> 00:46:48,927
see through his eyes.

735
00:46:48,961 --> 00:46:50,328
Only when I'm asleep.

736
00:46:50,363 --> 00:46:52,898
That's how it begins until
you learn to control it.

737
00:46:52,932 --> 00:46:54,299
You're a warg.

738
00:46:54,334 --> 00:46:57,035
It's not just wolves.

739
00:46:57,070 --> 00:46:58,870
Sometimes in my dreams
there's a--

740
00:46:58,905 --> 00:47:01,640
- A three-eyed raven?
- <i>You've seen it?</i>

741
00:47:01,674 --> 00:47:03,909
We saw him together.
You haven't forgotten?

742
00:47:03,943 --> 00:47:06,645
Does it have anything
to do with warging?

743
00:47:06,679 --> 00:47:09,414
No, the raven
is something different,

744
00:47:09,448 --> 00:47:11,783
something deeper.

745
00:47:11,817 --> 00:47:13,284
The raven brings the sight.

746
00:47:13,318 --> 00:47:16,287
Seeing things
that haven't happened yet?

747
00:47:16,321 --> 00:47:18,556
<i>Or things that happened</i>
<i>long before you were born</i>

748
00:47:18,590 --> 00:47:22,293
or things that are happening right
now thousands of miles away.

749
00:47:22,328 --> 00:47:24,662
What's he telling him?

750
00:47:24,697 --> 00:47:26,898
Why don't you ask?

751
00:47:28,433 --> 00:47:30,368
Isn't he ashamed, your brother,

752
00:47:30,402 --> 00:47:32,103
needing you to protect him?

753
00:47:33,238 --> 00:47:34,905
Where's the shame in that?

754
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:38,542
Any boy his age who needs
his sister to protect him

755
00:47:38,577 --> 00:47:42,412
is gonna find himself
needing lots of protecting.

756
00:47:43,648 --> 00:47:46,850
Some people
will always need help.

757
00:47:46,884 --> 00:47:49,219
<i>That doesn't mean</i>
<i>they're not worth helping.</i>

758
00:47:53,558 --> 00:47:56,894
When my father died,
I dreamt it.

759
00:47:56,928 --> 00:48:00,264
You didn't dream it.
You saw it.

760
00:48:00,332 --> 00:48:02,233
So did I.

761
00:48:02,267 --> 00:48:03,868
You have the sight, too?

762
00:48:06,872 --> 00:48:11,008
When I told my father
about your father...

763
00:48:12,444 --> 00:48:15,579
for the first time
in my life, I saw him cry.

764
00:48:15,613 --> 00:48:17,314
Your father is Howland Reed?

765
00:48:17,348 --> 00:48:19,048
Yeah.

766
00:48:19,083 --> 00:48:22,352
He saved my father's life
during the rebellion.

767
00:48:22,386 --> 00:48:24,187
Your father told you
about the rebellion?

768
00:48:24,221 --> 00:48:26,222
Mine never did.

769
00:48:26,257 --> 00:48:28,091
But I saw that, too.

770
00:48:28,125 --> 00:48:31,327
What else have you seen?

771
00:48:31,362 --> 00:48:33,329
Only one thing
that matters--

772
00:48:33,364 --> 00:48:35,465
you.

773
00:48:46,377 --> 00:48:48,178
<i>I never liked
the skinny ones.</i>

774
00:48:48,213 --> 00:48:50,080
<i>Like drinking from a puddle.</i>

775
00:48:50,115 --> 00:48:51,916
Not that I'm averse
to drinking from a puddle

776
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:53,251
every now and again,
you understand.

777
00:48:53,285 --> 00:48:55,286
I don't drink ale.

778
00:48:55,321 --> 00:48:58,023
There's no story so good
a drink won't make it better.

779
00:48:58,057 --> 00:48:59,791
- Yeah!
- You see?

780
00:48:59,826 --> 00:49:02,061
They've all suffered through
my bouts of sobriety.

781
00:49:02,095 --> 00:49:04,396
It's very tedious
for all concerned.

782
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:06,898
Now, how did
three children--

783
00:49:06,933 --> 00:49:08,467
We're not children.

784
00:49:08,501 --> 00:49:11,236
How did three young persons
such as yourselves,

785
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:13,839
untrained in the art of war,

786
00:49:13,873 --> 00:49:15,508
escape from Harrenhal?

787
00:49:17,877 --> 00:49:19,845
Gendry's a smith.

788
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,547
He was apprenticed
in the armory.

789
00:49:21,581 --> 00:49:24,884
A smith, eh?
Where'd you train?

790
00:49:28,021 --> 00:49:30,857
King's Landing.
Tobho Mott's shop.

791
00:49:30,891 --> 00:49:33,026
That criminal.
He charges twice as much

792
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:34,527
as every other armorer
in the city.

793
00:49:34,562 --> 00:49:36,196
That's because
he's twice as good.

794
00:49:36,263 --> 00:49:39,599
Aha! A smith
and a salesman.

795
00:49:39,634 --> 00:49:41,868
Gendry stole us weapons.

796
00:49:41,903 --> 00:49:44,738
Ah, fought your way
out of Harrenhal, I see.

797
00:49:44,772 --> 00:49:48,308
He knows how to use a
sword and so do I.

798
00:49:49,777 --> 00:49:51,845
My brothers taught me.

799
00:49:55,316 --> 00:49:58,485
Ooh!

800
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:16,203
To your brothers!

801
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:25,078
You can finish
your meals before you go.

802
00:50:25,113 --> 00:50:27,547
It may be awhile
before you see another.

803
00:50:27,582 --> 00:50:30,617
- You'll free us?
- I gave you my word.

804
00:50:33,353 --> 00:50:35,121
But before you go,

805
00:50:35,155 --> 00:50:38,423
allow me to raise
a cup to your--

806
00:50:38,458 --> 00:50:41,026
Hey, hey.

807
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:43,762
Now that is an uncommonly
large person.

808
00:50:43,797 --> 00:50:45,331
How does one manage to subdue

809
00:50:45,365 --> 00:50:47,132
such an uncommonly
large person?

810
00:50:47,166 --> 00:50:49,868
One waits for him to drink
until he passes out.

811
00:50:49,903 --> 00:50:52,704
Poor man.
You have my sympathy.

812
00:50:54,674 --> 00:50:58,009
Aha, not a man at all.

813
00:50:59,145 --> 00:51:02,113
A Hound!

814
00:51:02,181 --> 00:51:04,749
So good to see
you again, Clegane.

815
00:51:04,784 --> 00:51:06,751
Thoros?

816
00:51:06,786 --> 00:51:09,187
The fuck you doing here?

817
00:51:09,221 --> 00:51:11,122
Drinking and talking too much.

818
00:51:11,157 --> 00:51:13,158
Same as ever.

819
00:51:13,192 --> 00:51:16,695
- A pretty prize, lads.
- Yeah!

820
00:51:18,598 --> 00:51:20,366
Girl.

821
00:51:22,335 --> 00:51:23,903
What in seven hells

822
00:51:23,937 --> 00:51:26,406
are you doing
with the Stark bitch?

823
00:51:37,452 --> 00:51:40,021
It's a tough decision--

824
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:42,056
take the bridge
and risk being seen

825
00:51:42,091 --> 00:51:43,992
or cross the great water.

826
00:51:44,026 --> 00:51:46,594
- Silence, Kingslayer.
- Anyone can see us on the bridge,

827
00:51:46,628 --> 00:51:49,631
but cross by water
and the current could take us

828
00:51:49,665 --> 00:51:51,632
or I could escape
down the river.

829
00:51:51,667 --> 00:51:53,534
Good luck.

830
00:51:55,504 --> 00:51:59,540
It's wonderful to watch you
wrestle with these dilemmas.

831
00:51:59,575 --> 00:52:01,709
Which will she choose?

832
00:52:06,616 --> 00:52:08,583
Gambler at heart.

833
00:52:08,618 --> 00:52:10,052
Wouldn't have guessed.

834
00:52:10,086 --> 00:52:12,221
Be quick about it.

835
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:20,730
- I need to rest.
- Get up.

836
00:52:20,764 --> 00:52:23,199
I have these, you know, on your
feet when you walk too far.

837
00:52:23,233 --> 00:52:24,400
- What do you call them?
- Get up now.

838
00:52:24,434 --> 00:52:26,936
Corns. I never
used to get corns.

839
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:29,304
<i>Of course I used</i>
<i>to ride everywhere,</i>

840
00:52:29,339 --> 00:52:31,807
not march around
like a common foot soldier

841
00:52:31,841 --> 00:52:34,075
wearing the same shit boots
for over a year.

842
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:36,511
This heel is ruined.
There's no way--

843
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:48,256
I never understood why some knights
felt the need to carry two swords.

844
00:53:03,039 --> 00:53:05,340
Ooh.

845
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:11,112
You move well...

846
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:16,116
for a great beast of a woman.

847
00:53:20,053 --> 00:53:22,121
You shouldn't grimace
before you lunge.

848
00:53:22,155 --> 00:53:24,656
It gives away the game.

849
00:53:38,204 --> 00:53:40,506
<i>Bit of a quandary for you.</i>

850
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:43,409
If you kill me,
you fail Lady Stark.

851
00:53:43,443 --> 00:53:46,045
<i>But if you don't kill me,</i>

852
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:48,381
I'm going to kill you.

853
00:53:54,255 --> 00:53:56,089
You're good.

854
00:53:56,124 --> 00:53:58,325
Graceless, but good.

855
00:54:07,335 --> 00:54:09,603
See? If you were
willing to hurt me,

856
00:54:09,637 --> 00:54:11,438
you might have had me there.

857
00:54:54,551 --> 00:54:57,587
Looks like your woman's
getting the better of you,

858
00:54:57,621 --> 00:54:59,656
if you can call that a woman.

859
00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:01,758
We enjoy a good fight.

860
00:55:01,792 --> 00:55:04,060
Gets our juices flowing.

861
00:55:04,094 --> 00:55:06,963
The Flayed Man of House Bolton.

862
00:55:07,031 --> 00:55:08,898
A bit gruesome for my taste.

863
00:55:08,933 --> 00:55:12,636
- You sure he's the one?
- That's him, all right.

864
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:14,470
I saw him fight at the tourney

865
00:55:14,505 --> 00:55:16,472
for Ser Willem Frey's wedding.

866
00:55:17,908 --> 00:55:20,710
Give the man his silver.

867
00:55:22,213 --> 00:55:24,480
Let us go and my father will
pay you whatever you want.

868
00:55:24,515 --> 00:55:26,783
Enough to buy me a new head?

869
00:55:26,817 --> 00:55:30,186
<i>If the King in the North</i>
<i>hears I had the Kingslayer</i>

870
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:33,089
and let him go,
he'll be taking it right off.

871
00:55:33,123 --> 00:55:35,258
I'd rather he takes yours.

872
