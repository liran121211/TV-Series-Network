2
00:01:42,425 --> 00:01:47,825
3x07
The Bear and the Maiden Fair

3
00:02:08,752 --> 00:02:10,419
How far are we?

4
00:02:10,453 --> 00:02:12,621
About a week, I think.

5
00:02:12,655 --> 00:02:15,190
You think?
You don't know?

6
00:02:15,224 --> 00:02:18,893
When we went to Castle
Black, we took the kingsroad.

7
00:02:18,927 --> 00:02:21,628
You and your roads.

8
00:02:21,663 --> 00:02:24,130
Is that how you lot
do your fighting?

9
00:02:24,165 --> 00:02:27,566
You march down the road banging
drums and waving banners?

10
00:02:27,601 --> 00:02:29,234
Most of the time, yes.

11
00:02:29,269 --> 00:02:32,938
How do the men holding
the banners fight?

12
00:02:32,972 --> 00:02:34,940
They don't, really.

13
00:02:34,975 --> 00:02:39,011
It's a great honor
to carry your house sigil.

14
00:02:39,046 --> 00:02:42,114
And the drummers-- is
that a great honor, too?

15
00:02:42,149 --> 00:02:45,150
Usually it's the young boys
banging the drums.

16
00:02:45,185 --> 00:02:46,819
So what good are they?

17
00:02:46,853 --> 00:02:50,256
- They help the men march.
- How?

18
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:53,860
Well, it's--
it's the rhythm.

19
00:02:53,894 --> 00:02:56,396
Oh, you mean right foot,
left foot,

20
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,431
right foot,
left foot, right foot?

21
00:02:58,466 --> 00:03:01,635
You need help remembering that?

22
00:03:01,669 --> 00:03:04,905
When Mance gives the signal
and we hit Castle Black,

23
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:08,409
we won't be banging on drums
to let them know we're coming.

24
00:03:08,443 --> 00:03:10,511
No.

25
00:03:12,013 --> 00:03:13,814
No, you're just gonna
light the biggest fire

26
00:03:13,848 --> 00:03:17,284
the North has ever seen to
let them know you're coming.

27
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:19,920
You know nothing, Jon Snow.

28
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,824
She's right, you don't.

29
00:03:27,794 --> 00:03:30,129
I know you cut me
loose on the Wall.

30
00:03:30,163 --> 00:03:31,897
Cut her loose, too.

31
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:33,965
Do you see her
sulking about it?

32
00:03:35,401 --> 00:03:38,069
That's because she understands
the way things are.

33
00:03:39,772 --> 00:03:42,674
And are you gonna
share it with me?

34
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:46,044
The deep wisdom you found
inside the head of a bird?

35
00:03:46,078 --> 00:03:48,446
People work together
when it suits them.

36
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,148
They're loyal
when it suits them.

37
00:03:50,182 --> 00:03:52,684
They love each other
when it suits them.

38
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:55,587
And they kill each other
when it suits them.

39
00:03:55,622 --> 00:03:57,757
She knows that, you don't.

40
00:03:57,791 --> 00:04:01,194
Which is why you'll
never hold onto her.

41
00:04:16,643 --> 00:04:19,679
That rain will cost us
another day.

42
00:04:21,281 --> 00:04:24,084
Frey will wait.
He knows we're coming.

43
00:04:24,118 --> 00:04:26,286
Lord Walder is prickly
by nature.

44
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,688
Prickly?
That what you call it?

45
00:04:28,722 --> 00:04:31,057
Might be the least
pleasant man I've ever met.

46
00:04:31,091 --> 00:04:33,726
- Yes, and that is why--
- I've seen wet shits

47
00:04:33,794 --> 00:04:36,929
<i>I liked better</i>
<i>than Walder Frey.</i>

48
00:04:39,565 --> 00:04:41,466
Apologies, Your Grace.

49
00:04:41,501 --> 00:04:44,569
Spent too many years around
lancers and pikemen.

50
00:04:44,603 --> 00:04:47,405
I've spent the last two
years nursing wounded men,

51
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:49,607
watching them bleed and die.

52
00:04:49,641 --> 00:04:51,676
I'm not afraid of wet shits.

53
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:55,947
Lord Frey will take
this delay as a slight.

54
00:04:55,982 --> 00:04:57,649
He can take it as he likes.

55
00:04:57,683 --> 00:04:59,785
He's getting
the wedding he wanted.

56
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:01,453
He's getting a wedding.

57
00:05:01,488 --> 00:05:03,789
It was a king he wanted.

58
00:05:03,824 --> 00:05:05,825
<i>Edmure is the best
match a Frey has had</i>

59
00:05:05,859 --> 00:05:08,728
in the history of their house.

60
00:05:08,762 --> 00:05:10,496
We should all get some sleep.

61
00:06:29,643 --> 00:06:31,177
If you don't put
some clothes on,

62
00:06:31,211 --> 00:06:33,713
I can't promise
I won't attack you again.

63
00:06:33,747 --> 00:06:35,948
Attack. Attack.

64
00:06:57,973 --> 00:06:59,907
<i>Who are you writing?</i>

65
00:06:59,941 --> 00:07:02,343
My mother.

66
00:07:03,545 --> 00:07:06,914
- Is that Valyrian?
- Gaaa.

67
00:07:06,948 --> 00:07:08,749
Gaaa?

68
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,692
Say hello for me.

69
00:07:17,726 --> 00:07:20,061
<i>Rytsas.</i>

70
00:07:20,095 --> 00:07:23,298
<i>"Ritsas."</i>

71
00:07:23,332 --> 00:07:25,333
That was close enough.

72
00:07:28,171 --> 00:07:31,006
Does she know
her daughter's a queen?

73
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,142
Not yet.

74
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:37,480
That will be
a surprise, I expect.

75
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:42,118
Many surprises for her.

76
00:07:46,191 --> 00:07:48,792
How am I supposed
to sit here planning a war

77
00:07:48,827 --> 00:07:51,128
when you're over there
looking like that?

78
00:07:55,066 --> 00:07:58,335
Will you come with me
one day to Volantis?

79
00:07:58,369 --> 00:08:00,938
<i>When all this is over?</i>

80
00:08:00,972 --> 00:08:03,207
I will.

81
00:08:03,241 --> 00:08:05,610
I promise.

82
00:08:09,815 --> 00:08:13,318
<i>I know she'd love to meet you.</i>

83
00:08:14,253 --> 00:08:16,454
And her grandchild.

84
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,260
What, now?

85
00:08:27,066 --> 00:08:29,334
Are you certain?

86
00:08:31,003 --> 00:08:33,505
Are you angry with me?

87
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,307
Angry?

88
00:08:38,478 --> 00:08:40,712
You're my queen.

89
00:08:43,383 --> 00:08:47,252
And I have your little prince
or princess inside me.

90
00:08:48,354 --> 00:08:50,789
Maybe one of each.

91
00:08:50,823 --> 00:08:52,824
Don't get greedy.

92
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:05,069
Can you leave the war
for one night?

93
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,474
I love you.

94
00:09:10,643 --> 00:09:13,379
Do you hear me?

95
00:09:13,413 --> 00:09:15,915
I love you.

96
00:09:29,997 --> 00:09:32,999
Most men fuck like dogs.

97
00:09:35,202 --> 00:09:37,636
No grace, no skill.

98
00:09:37,671 --> 00:09:39,705
A few dozen thrusts and done.

99
00:09:39,739 --> 00:09:42,841
You need to be patient.
Give her time.

100
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:45,143
Your cock shouldn't go near her

101
00:09:45,177 --> 00:09:48,479
till she's slick
as a baby seal.

102
00:09:48,513 --> 00:09:51,248
And then you go inside,

103
00:09:51,283 --> 00:09:52,917
<i>but slowly.</i>

104
00:09:52,951 --> 00:09:56,387
Don't jam it in like
you're spearing a pig.

105
00:09:56,421 --> 00:09:57,989
Come on!

106
00:09:58,023 --> 00:10:01,459
Hey, come on.

107
00:10:13,105 --> 00:10:15,773
You think he
loves you, is that it?

108
00:10:15,808 --> 00:10:18,643
What did he tell you? He's
gonna make you his lady

109
00:10:18,677 --> 00:10:21,146
and live with you
in some castle?

110
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,815
No, he didn't tell me anything.

111
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,584
He barely talks.

112
00:10:25,618 --> 00:10:27,820
I've seen you two
whispering in the night,

113
00:10:27,854 --> 00:10:30,022
giggling like a pair of girls.

114
00:10:30,056 --> 00:10:31,923
What, you're jealous?

115
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:33,859
Of course I'm jealous.

116
00:10:33,893 --> 00:10:35,727
You should be
with one of your own.

117
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:37,562
And you're one of my own?

118
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:39,356
I've never heard
a kind word from your mouth.

119
00:10:39,365 --> 00:10:42,566
You would if you were mine.

120
00:10:44,535 --> 00:10:47,270
I'd tell you
that you're beautiful

121
00:10:47,305 --> 00:10:50,641
and fierce and wild.

122
00:10:50,675 --> 00:10:52,809
I'd be good to you.

123
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,747
You love him?

124
00:11:04,254 --> 00:11:06,922
'Cause he's pretty?
Is that it?

125
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:10,059
You like his pretty hair
and his pretty eyes?

126
00:11:11,895 --> 00:11:14,697
- You think pretty is gonna make you happy?
- Don't touch me.

127
00:11:14,731 --> 00:11:17,934
You won't love him so much when
you find out what he really is.

128
00:11:21,271 --> 00:11:25,074
Growing up at Winterfell, all
I ever wanted was to escape,

129
00:11:25,108 --> 00:11:29,245
to come here to the capital.

130
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,914
See the southern knights
and their painted armor

131
00:11:31,949 --> 00:11:35,418
and King's Landing
after dark--

132
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,956
all the candles burning
in all those windows.

133
00:11:42,126 --> 00:11:44,126
I'm stupid.

134
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:46,629
A stupid little girl

135
00:11:46,663 --> 00:11:49,632
with stupid dreams
who never learns.

136
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,600
Come on.

137
00:11:53,369 --> 00:11:55,504
Come walk with me.

138
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,208
I remember the first time
I saw you in the throne room.

139
00:12:00,243 --> 00:12:03,511
I'd never seen anyone
who looked so unhappy.

140
00:12:03,546 --> 00:12:05,980
I want very much for you
to be happy, Sansa,

141
00:12:06,014 --> 00:12:08,149
and so does my grandmother.

142
00:12:10,685 --> 00:12:13,187
You would have been
happy at Highgarden.

143
00:12:13,221 --> 00:12:14,755
But women in our position

144
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:17,792
must make the best
of our circumstances.

145
00:12:17,826 --> 00:12:20,829
How do I make the best
of my circumstances?

146
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:23,131
I have to marry him.

147
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:28,170
- Has Lord Tyrion mistreated you?
- No.

148
00:12:28,204 --> 00:12:30,706
Has he been kind to you?

149
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,008
He's tried.

150
00:12:33,042 --> 00:12:34,509
You don't want him, though.

151
00:12:34,544 --> 00:12:35,844
He's a Lannister.

152
00:12:35,878 --> 00:12:38,480
Far from the worst
Lannister, wouldn't you say?

153
00:12:40,483 --> 00:12:41,717
I'm sorry.

154
00:12:41,751 --> 00:12:44,586
Here I am complaining to you...

155
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,189
My son will be king.

156
00:12:47,223 --> 00:12:48,691
Sons learn from their mothers.

157
00:12:48,725 --> 00:12:51,626
I plan to teach mine
a great deal.

158
00:12:51,661 --> 00:12:54,463
And your son,
if I'm not mistaken,

159
00:12:54,497 --> 00:12:58,434
your son might be
the Lord of Casterly Rock

160
00:12:58,468 --> 00:13:00,336
and the North someday.

161
00:13:02,539 --> 00:13:04,640
What?

162
00:13:05,608 --> 00:13:07,142
My son...

163
00:13:07,176 --> 00:13:09,277
with him.

164
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:14,049
I'll have to--

165
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:16,018
we'll have to--

166
00:13:16,052 --> 00:13:17,987
If it's the pain
you're worried about--

167
00:13:18,021 --> 00:13:20,222
I'm not afraid of the pain.

168
00:13:20,256 --> 00:13:22,358
Not after what
Joffrey's done to me.

169
00:13:22,392 --> 00:13:23,993
What is it, then?

170
00:13:26,062 --> 00:13:28,531
He's rather good-looking
even with the scar.

171
00:13:28,565 --> 00:13:30,767
Especially with the scar.

172
00:13:30,801 --> 00:13:33,202
He's a dwarf.

173
00:13:33,237 --> 00:13:35,438
And Loras--

174
00:13:35,473 --> 00:13:37,240
Loras.

175
00:13:40,178 --> 00:13:42,479
Some women like tall men.

176
00:13:42,513 --> 00:13:44,148
Some like short men.

177
00:13:44,182 --> 00:13:46,951
Some like hairy men.
Some like bald men.

178
00:13:46,985 --> 00:13:50,187
Gentle men, rough men,
ugly men, pretty men,

179
00:13:50,222 --> 00:13:52,590
pretty girls.

180
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:55,693
Most women don't know what they
like until they've tried it.

181
00:13:55,727 --> 00:13:59,363
And, sadly, so many of us
get to try so little

182
00:13:59,397 --> 00:14:01,665
before we're old and gray.

183
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:04,735
Tyrion may surprise you.

184
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:08,472
From what I've heard,
he's quite experienced.

185
00:14:08,506 --> 00:14:11,742
And that's a good thing?

186
00:14:11,777 --> 00:14:13,177
<i>It can be.</i>

187
00:14:13,212 --> 00:14:14,979
We're very complicated,
you know.

188
00:14:15,014 --> 00:14:17,348
Pleasing us takes practice.

189
00:14:17,383 --> 00:14:19,784
How do you know all this?

190
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:22,219
Did your mother teach you?

191
00:14:25,457 --> 00:14:28,258
Yes, sweet girl.
My mother taught me.

192
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:33,765
<i>She's a child.</i>

193
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:35,333
<i>She's a foot
taller than you.</i>

194
00:14:35,367 --> 00:14:37,168
A tall child.

195
00:14:37,202 --> 00:14:39,237
What's the youngest
you've ever had?

196
00:14:39,271 --> 00:14:40,772
Not that young.

197
00:14:40,807 --> 00:14:43,041
How much older?

198
00:14:43,076 --> 00:14:44,810
Older.

199
00:14:44,844 --> 00:14:47,947
You're a lord, she's a lady.

200
00:14:47,981 --> 00:14:49,815
And a beauty at that.

201
00:14:49,849 --> 00:14:51,383
I don't see the problem.

202
00:14:51,418 --> 00:14:53,686
Shae isn't going to like it.

203
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,454
Shae is a whore.

204
00:14:55,489 --> 00:14:58,091
Are you gonna
marry her? Eh?

205
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:01,194
How did marrying a whore work
out for you the first time?

206
00:15:01,229 --> 00:15:04,164
I should never have
told you about that.

207
00:15:04,198 --> 00:15:07,567
You want Shae, keep her.
Wed one and bed the other.

208
00:15:07,602 --> 00:15:10,771
All you have to do is get
a son in the Stark girl.

209
00:15:10,805 --> 00:15:12,673
He'll be Lord
of Winterfell one day.

210
00:15:12,707 --> 00:15:14,908
You can rule the North
in his name.

211
00:15:14,942 --> 00:15:17,711
You'll have two women and a
whole kingdom of your own.

212
00:15:17,745 --> 00:15:19,580
Two women to despise me

213
00:15:19,614 --> 00:15:21,915
and a whole kingdom
to join them.

214
00:15:23,418 --> 00:15:26,753
You waste time trying
to get people to love you,

215
00:15:26,788 --> 00:15:29,556
you'll end up the most
popular dead man in town.

216
00:15:33,661 --> 00:15:35,663
You want to fuck
that Stark girl.

217
00:15:35,697 --> 00:15:38,298
<i>You just don't want</i>
<i>to admit it.</i>

218
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:42,236
I don't pay you to put
evil notions in my head.

219
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:45,106
The ones already there
don't need company.

220
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,708
You pay me to kill people
who bother you.

221
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:52,613
Evil notions come free.

222
00:16:24,744 --> 00:16:26,679
Your Grace.

223
00:16:26,713 --> 00:16:28,815
Grandfather.

224
00:16:28,849 --> 00:16:31,151
You wanted to speak to me?

225
00:16:31,185 --> 00:16:32,952
Yes.

226
00:16:32,987 --> 00:16:36,990
I'd like a report on the
meetings of my small council.

227
00:16:37,025 --> 00:16:39,093
You're welcome
to attend the meetings

228
00:16:39,127 --> 00:16:41,329
of your small council,
Your Grace.

229
00:16:41,363 --> 00:16:42,831
Any or all of them.

230
00:16:42,865 --> 00:16:44,700
I've been very busy.

231
00:16:44,734 --> 00:16:47,336
Many important matters
require a king's attention.

232
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:49,538
Of course.

233
00:16:50,673 --> 00:16:53,108
You've been holding
the council meetings

234
00:16:53,142 --> 00:16:56,711
in the Tower of the Hand instead
of the small council chamber.

235
00:16:56,746 --> 00:16:58,413
I have, yes.

236
00:16:59,749 --> 00:17:01,450
May I ask why?

237
00:17:01,484 --> 00:17:04,486
The Tower of the Hand
is where I work.

238
00:17:04,521 --> 00:17:07,689
To walk from there
to here would take time,

239
00:17:07,723 --> 00:17:10,392
time I could otherwise
spend productively.

240
00:17:10,426 --> 00:17:12,794
So if I wanted to attend
a council meeting,

241
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:16,698
I would now have to climb all the
stairs in the Tower of the Hand?

242
00:17:31,881 --> 00:17:35,017
We could arrange
to have you carried.

243
00:17:38,288 --> 00:17:40,322
Tell me about
the Targaryen girl

244
00:17:40,357 --> 00:17:43,391
in the east and her dragons.

245
00:17:43,426 --> 00:17:45,060
Where did you hear about this?

246
00:17:45,094 --> 00:17:47,562
Is it true?

247
00:17:47,596 --> 00:17:49,664
Apparently so.

248
00:17:51,667 --> 00:17:55,936
Don't you think we ought
to do something about it?

249
00:17:57,038 --> 00:17:58,672
When I was Hand of the King

250
00:17:58,707 --> 00:18:00,941
under your father's
predecessor,

251
00:18:00,975 --> 00:18:03,577
the skulls of all
the Targaryen dragons

252
00:18:03,611 --> 00:18:06,045
were kept in this room.

253
00:18:07,514 --> 00:18:09,815
The skull of the last of them

254
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,884
was right here.

255
00:18:11,918 --> 00:18:15,354
It was the size of an apple.

256
00:18:16,556 --> 00:18:19,358
And the biggest
was the size of a carriage.

257
00:18:19,426 --> 00:18:22,161
Yes, and the creature
to whom it belonged

258
00:18:22,195 --> 00:18:25,364
died 300 years ago.

259
00:18:25,399 --> 00:18:28,000
Curiosities on the far
side of the world

260
00:18:28,035 --> 00:18:29,368
are no threat to us.

261
00:18:29,403 --> 00:18:32,805
But how do we know these
dragons are just curiosities

262
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,875
and not the beasts that brought
the whole world to heel?

263
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:38,878
Because we have been told
as much by the many experts

264
00:18:38,912 --> 00:18:41,047
who serve the realm
by counseling the king

265
00:18:41,081 --> 00:18:43,015
on matters about
which he knows nothing.

266
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:45,484
But I haven't been counseled.

267
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:49,188
You are being counseled
at this very moment.

268
00:18:50,891 --> 00:18:54,427
I should be consulted
about such things.

269
00:18:54,461 --> 00:18:55,962
From now on, I will see to it

270
00:18:55,996 --> 00:18:58,064
that you are
appropriately consulted

271
00:18:58,098 --> 00:19:00,366
on important matters

272
00:19:00,401 --> 00:19:02,502
whenever necessary.

273
00:19:08,475 --> 00:19:10,009
Your Grace.

274
00:19:23,322 --> 00:19:25,056
Yunkai.

275
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:27,157
The Yellow City.

276
00:19:30,929 --> 00:19:34,264
<i>The Yunkish train
bed slaves, not soldiers.</i>

277
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:36,333
We can defeat them.

278
00:19:36,367 --> 00:19:38,802
On the field, with ease.

279
00:19:38,837 --> 00:19:40,571
But they won't
meet us on the field.

280
00:19:40,605 --> 00:19:43,774
They have provisions,
patience, and strong walls.

281
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:46,277
<i>If they're wise, they'll
hide behind those walls</i>

282
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:49,013
and chip away at us,
man by man.

283
00:19:49,047 --> 00:19:53,017
I don't want half my army killed
before I've crossed the Narrow Sea.

284
00:19:53,051 --> 00:19:56,287
We don't need Yunkai, khaleesi.

285
00:19:56,322 --> 00:19:58,991
Taking this city will not bring
you any closer to Westeros

286
00:19:59,025 --> 00:20:01,293
or the Iron Throne.

287
00:20:03,763 --> 00:20:06,398
How many slaves
are there in Yunkai?

288
00:20:06,433 --> 00:20:10,403
200,000, if not more.

289
00:20:10,437 --> 00:20:14,440
Then we have 200,000
reasons to take the city.

290
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,943
_

291
00:20:20,063 --> 00:20:24,549
_

292
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,647
_

293
00:21:55,206 --> 00:21:57,273
Now comes the noble
Razdal mo Eraz

294
00:21:57,308 --> 00:22:00,744
of that ancient
and honorable house,

295
00:22:00,811 --> 00:22:03,113
<i>master of men</i>
<i>and speaker to savages,</i>

296
00:22:03,147 --> 00:22:06,750
<i>to offer terms of peace.</i>

297
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:09,052
Noble lord, you are
in the presence

298
00:22:09,086 --> 00:22:11,955
of Daenerys Stormborn
of House Targaryen,

299
00:22:11,989 --> 00:22:14,624
Queen of the Andals
and the First Men,

300
00:22:14,658 --> 00:22:16,826
<i>Khaleesi</i>
<i>of the Great Grass Sea,</i>

301
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:20,196
<i>Breaker of Chains,</i>
<i>and Mother of Dragons.</i>

302
00:22:21,165 --> 00:22:24,434
You may approach.
Sit.

303
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:36,144
Will the noble lord
take refreshment?

304
00:22:47,622 --> 00:22:51,159
Ancient and glorious is Yunkai.

305
00:22:51,193 --> 00:22:52,827
Our empire was old

306
00:22:52,861 --> 00:22:55,897
before dragons stirred
in old Valyria.

307
00:22:55,931 --> 00:22:59,200
<i>Many an army has broken</i>
<i>against our walls.</i>

308
00:22:59,234 --> 00:23:01,970
You shall find no easy
conquest here, khaleesi.

309
00:23:05,608 --> 00:23:08,343
Good.
My Unsullied need practice.

310
00:23:08,377 --> 00:23:10,345
I was told to blood them early.

311
00:23:10,412 --> 00:23:14,550
If blood is your desire,
blood shall flow.

312
00:23:15,652 --> 00:23:17,320
But why?

313
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:20,689
'Tis true you have committed
savageries in Astapor.

314
00:23:20,724 --> 00:23:24,927
But the Yunkai are a forgiving
and generous people.

315
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:30,800
The wise masters of Yunkai
have sent a gift

316
00:23:30,835 --> 00:23:32,468
for the silver queen.

317
00:23:38,242 --> 00:23:42,879
There is far more than this awaiting
you on the deck of your ship.

318
00:23:42,913 --> 00:23:44,947
- My ship?
- Yes, khaleesi.

319
00:23:44,982 --> 00:23:47,784
As I said,
we are a generous people.

320
00:23:47,818 --> 00:23:50,487
<i>You shall have as many
ships as you require.</i>

321
00:23:50,521 --> 00:23:52,589
And what do you ask in return?

322
00:23:52,623 --> 00:23:56,826
All we ask is that
you make use of these ships.

323
00:23:56,861 --> 00:23:59,362
Sail them back to Westeros
where you belong

324
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:02,265
and leave us to conduct
our affairs in peace.

325
00:24:05,203 --> 00:24:07,538
I have a gift for you as well.

326
00:24:08,506 --> 00:24:10,941
- Your life.
- My life?

327
00:24:10,975 --> 00:24:12,676
And the lives
of your wise masters.

328
00:24:12,711 --> 00:24:16,280
But I also want
something in return.

329
00:24:16,314 --> 00:24:19,884
You will release
every slave in Yunkai.

330
00:24:19,918 --> 00:24:22,987
Every man, woman, and child
shall be given as much food,

331
00:24:23,021 --> 00:24:24,822
clothing, and property
as they can carry

332
00:24:24,856 --> 00:24:28,159
as payment for their
years of servitude.

333
00:24:28,193 --> 00:24:30,227
Reject this gift,

334
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:32,629
and I shall show you no mercy.

335
00:24:32,664 --> 00:24:34,665
You are mad.

336
00:24:34,699 --> 00:24:36,500
<i>We are not Astapor or Qarth.</i>

337
00:24:36,534 --> 00:24:39,736
We are Yunkai and we have
powerful friends.

338
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:43,507
Friends who would take great
pleasure in destroying you.

339
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:46,510
Those who survive,
we shall enslave once more.

340
00:24:46,544 --> 00:24:48,879
Perhaps we'll make
a slave of you as well.

341
00:24:51,015 --> 00:24:53,650
You swore me safe conduct.

342
00:24:53,685 --> 00:24:57,554
I did, but my dragons
made no promises.

343
00:24:57,588 --> 00:25:00,123
And you threatened
their mother.

344
00:25:00,158 --> 00:25:02,326
Take the gold.

345
00:25:11,869 --> 00:25:14,838
My gold. You gave
it to me, remember?

346
00:25:14,872 --> 00:25:16,640
And I shall put it to good use.

347
00:25:16,674 --> 00:25:19,509
You'd be wise to do the
same with my gift to you.

348
00:25:19,544 --> 00:25:21,159
Now get out.

349
00:25:25,082 --> 00:25:27,918
The Yunkish are a proud people.

350
00:25:27,952 --> 00:25:29,520
They will not bend.

351
00:25:29,554 --> 00:25:32,523
And what happens to things
that don't bend?

352
00:25:32,557 --> 00:25:34,592
He said he had
powerful friends.

353
00:25:34,626 --> 00:25:36,427
Who was he talking about?

354
00:25:36,461 --> 00:25:38,729
I don't know.

355
00:25:38,763 --> 00:25:41,165
Find out.

356
00:25:56,081 --> 00:25:58,616
Chains?

357
00:25:58,651 --> 00:26:01,887
Solid gold from the mines
outside Lannisport.

358
00:26:01,921 --> 00:26:04,090
Smithed in Casterly Rock.

359
00:26:04,124 --> 00:26:06,525
Golden chains.

360
00:26:07,928 --> 00:26:10,163
You could buy
a ship with these.

361
00:26:10,197 --> 00:26:11,931
- Do I need a ship?
- What?

362
00:26:11,966 --> 00:26:15,769
- Am I going somewhere?
- Of course you're not going anywhere.

363
00:26:15,803 --> 00:26:19,906
So, am I invited
to your wedding?

364
00:26:21,609 --> 00:26:24,377
I didn't ask for this marriage.

365
00:26:24,412 --> 00:26:26,914
- I didn't want it.
- No?

366
00:26:26,948 --> 00:26:29,250
She's a beautiful girl.
You said so yourself.

367
00:26:29,284 --> 00:26:31,319
That doesn't mean that--

368
00:26:31,353 --> 00:26:33,554
this is duty, not desire.

369
00:26:33,589 --> 00:26:36,157
Is that what you will tell
yourself when you fuck her?

370
00:26:36,192 --> 00:26:38,293
I don't have a choice.
My father--

371
00:26:38,328 --> 00:26:40,929
Does not rule the world.

372
00:26:44,301 --> 00:26:46,669
We can still go
across the Narrow Sea.

373
00:26:46,703 --> 00:26:48,537
What would I do there?

374
00:26:48,572 --> 00:26:50,305
Juggle?

375
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:53,442
I am a Lannister
of Casterly Rock.

376
00:26:53,476 --> 00:26:56,077
And I'm Shae the funny whore.

377
00:26:56,112 --> 00:26:59,981
My feelings for you
have not changed.

378
00:27:00,015 --> 00:27:03,217
I will marry Sansa Stark
and do my duty by her.

379
00:27:03,251 --> 00:27:05,486
While I empty her chamber pot

380
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,288
and lick your cock
when you're bored?

381
00:27:07,322 --> 00:27:09,823
I swear to you
it will not be like that.

382
00:27:09,858 --> 00:27:12,659
No?
What will it be like?

383
00:27:14,061 --> 00:27:18,064
I will buy you a good home
somewhere in the city.

384
00:27:18,099 --> 00:27:20,267
You will have fine clothes,

385
00:27:20,301 --> 00:27:23,070
guards to keep
you safe, servants.

386
00:27:25,274 --> 00:27:27,542
Any children we might have

387
00:27:27,576 --> 00:27:29,510
will be well provided for.

388
00:27:29,545 --> 00:27:31,912
Children?
You think I want children

389
00:27:31,947 --> 00:27:33,581
who can never see their father?

390
00:27:33,615 --> 00:27:35,182
Who would be killed
in their sleep

391
00:27:35,217 --> 00:27:37,518
if their grandfather
found out about them?

392
00:27:37,552 --> 00:27:39,419
Listen.

393
00:27:39,454 --> 00:27:41,721
Listen to me, my lady.

394
00:27:41,756 --> 00:27:44,090
- I'm not your lady.
- You are.

395
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:47,360
You'll always be my lady.

396
00:27:51,231 --> 00:27:53,599
I'm your whore.

397
00:27:53,633 --> 00:27:56,969
And when you are tired
of fucking me,

398
00:27:57,003 --> 00:27:59,104
I will be nothing.

399
00:28:28,867 --> 00:28:31,536
- What happened?
- Wildfire.

400
00:28:32,771 --> 00:28:34,706
I should have been here.

401
00:28:36,475 --> 00:28:38,610
After all the running
and fighting,

402
00:28:38,644 --> 00:28:41,513
here I am,
back where I started.

403
00:28:41,547 --> 00:28:43,782
Do you miss it?

404
00:28:43,816 --> 00:28:46,784
- King's Landing?
- Your father's house.

405
00:28:46,819 --> 00:28:49,721
Never had a father.
Never wanted one.

406
00:28:49,755 --> 00:28:53,324
Haven't you ever wondered
where your strength came from?

407
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:55,126
Your talent for fighting?

408
00:28:55,161 --> 00:28:56,661
I'm lowborn.

409
00:28:56,695 --> 00:28:58,930
As low as can be.
My mother was a tavern wench.

410
00:28:58,964 --> 00:29:00,798
Mine was a slave.

411
00:29:00,833 --> 00:29:02,834
So was I.

412
00:29:02,868 --> 00:29:04,870
Bought and sold,

413
00:29:04,904 --> 00:29:06,872
scourged and branded,

414
00:29:06,906 --> 00:29:09,174
until the Lord of Light
reached down,

415
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:11,309
took me in his hand
and raised me up.

416
00:29:13,146 --> 00:29:14,713
I was born in Flea Bottom.

417
00:29:14,747 --> 00:29:17,182
Your blood is noble.

418
00:29:18,651 --> 00:29:21,487
Are you saying my father,

419
00:29:21,521 --> 00:29:24,023
he was some lord or...

420
00:29:24,057 --> 00:29:25,324
There.

421
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:27,593
Your father's house.

422
00:29:34,334 --> 00:29:36,002
I'm just a bastard.

423
00:29:38,205 --> 00:29:41,308
The bastard of Robert
of the House Baratheon,

424
00:29:41,342 --> 00:29:43,610
First of His Name,
King of the Andals

425
00:29:43,645 --> 00:29:45,412
and the First Men.

426
00:29:45,446 --> 00:29:49,116
Why do you think
the gold cloaks wanted you?

427
00:29:50,718 --> 00:29:53,286
There is power
in a king's blood.

428
00:30:09,268 --> 00:30:11,636
Come sit by the fire, child.

429
00:30:14,373 --> 00:30:15,773
Not talking, eh?

430
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:17,976
That's a first.

431
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:20,344
I don't talk to traitors.

432
00:30:22,781 --> 00:30:24,515
I didn't like
giving up the boy.

433
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:26,217
But you did.

434
00:30:26,251 --> 00:30:29,420
You took the gold
and you gave him up.

435
00:30:30,488 --> 00:30:33,457
The Red God
is the one true god.

436
00:30:33,491 --> 00:30:35,926
You've seen his power.

437
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,161
When he commands, we obey.

438
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:42,198
He's not my one true god.

439
00:30:42,232 --> 00:30:45,735
No?
Who's yours?

440
00:30:48,205 --> 00:30:50,006
Death.

441
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:02,720
Spotted a Lannister
raiding party.

442
00:31:02,755 --> 00:31:05,223
- How many?
- <i>No more than 20.</i>

443
00:31:05,258 --> 00:31:07,893
- How far?
- Less than a day's ride south.

444
00:31:10,965 --> 00:31:13,499
What do you say, boys?
Time for a lion hunt?

445
00:31:13,534 --> 00:31:15,569
Yeah!

446
00:31:17,138 --> 00:31:18,739
But what about Riverrun?

447
00:31:18,773 --> 00:31:20,607
It's not south.
It's west of here.

448
00:31:20,642 --> 00:31:22,843
It will still be west of here
two days from now.

449
00:31:22,877 --> 00:31:26,013
- You swore.
- To take you home, and I will.

450
00:31:26,047 --> 00:31:28,215
But we need to do this first.

451
00:31:28,249 --> 00:31:30,117
Why? So you can
steal their gold?

452
00:31:30,151 --> 00:31:31,685
I swear to you,
this isn't--

453
00:31:31,719 --> 00:31:34,355
I don't care what you swear
because you're a liar.

454
00:31:34,389 --> 00:31:36,023
You lied to Gendry,
you lied to me.

455
00:31:36,057 --> 00:31:39,427
You'll lie to anyone. I hope
the Lannisters kill you all.

456
00:31:39,461 --> 00:31:42,497
One day you'll understand,
but now--

457
00:31:45,001 --> 00:31:48,036
- Anguy, bring her back.
- Come back, girl!

458
00:32:12,695 --> 00:32:14,328
Kick all you like, wolf girl.

459
00:32:14,363 --> 00:32:16,831
Won't do you no good.

460
00:32:33,948 --> 00:32:36,016
I thought you were gone.

461
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:38,185
Tomorrow.

462
00:32:41,522 --> 00:32:44,524
Have they told you what
they plan to do with me?

463
00:32:46,126 --> 00:32:49,095
Lord Bolton's traveling
tomorrow as well.

464
00:32:49,129 --> 00:32:52,265
He's going to the Twins
for Edmure Tully's wedding.

465
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,701
You're to remain here.

466
00:32:54,735 --> 00:32:57,204
With Locke?

467
00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:06,181
I owe you a debt.

468
00:33:10,019 --> 00:33:11,986
When Catelyn Stark
released you,

469
00:33:12,021 --> 00:33:14,723
we both made a promise to her.

470
00:33:14,757 --> 00:33:16,724
<i>Now it's your promise.</i>

471
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:19,460
You gave your word.

472
00:33:19,494 --> 00:33:21,061
Keep it

473
00:33:21,096 --> 00:33:24,064
and consider the debt paid.

474
00:33:25,299 --> 00:33:28,134
I will return the Stark
girls to their mother.

475
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:31,404
I swear it.

476
00:33:36,911 --> 00:33:39,379
Good-bye, Ser Jaime.

477
00:33:58,601 --> 00:34:01,537
Here.
Let me.

478
00:34:09,246 --> 00:34:10,847
It will take time.

479
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:18,621
Qyburn hopes your father
will force the Citadel

480
00:34:18,655 --> 00:34:20,390
<i>to give him back his chain.</i>

481
00:34:20,424 --> 00:34:22,292
My father will make
him Grand Maester

482
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:24,794
if he grows me a new hand.

483
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:28,732
You will give my regards
to Lord Tywin, I trust?

484
00:34:30,434 --> 00:34:33,804
Tell Robb Stark I'm sorry I
couldn't make his uncle's wedding.

485
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:37,007
The Lannisters send
their regards.

486
00:34:42,081 --> 00:34:44,282
Safe journey, Kingslayer.

487
00:34:45,151 --> 00:34:46,585
Nothing to say?

488
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:49,021
I liked you better before.

489
00:34:49,055 --> 00:34:52,357
I don't remember chopping
your balls off, too.

490
00:34:52,391 --> 00:34:55,293
And don't you worry
about your friend.

491
00:34:55,327 --> 00:34:58,463
We'll take good care of her.

492
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,849
Shh.

493
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:44,040
Gentle, my lord.

494
00:35:44,074 --> 00:35:46,275
Gentle.

495
00:35:54,818 --> 00:35:57,854
Shh shh shh.

496
00:35:57,888 --> 00:36:00,557
Myranda knows what she's doing.

497
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:02,259
Let her.

498
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:05,562
She trained as a septa, only...

499
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,866
she had other urges.

500
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:13,737
So did the Septons,
only they lied about it.

501
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:16,807
Where is he?

502
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,341
Who, my lord?

503
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:21,912
There's no one here
but you, me, and Violet.

504
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:24,514
Please.

505
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:26,750
Don't you want us to see it?

506
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:28,819
Oh, come on.
Let us see it.

507
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:31,088
Everybody talks about it.

508
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:34,125
He sent you.

509
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:35,659
Who sent us?

510
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:37,762
We sent ourselves,
Lord Greyjoy.

511
00:36:37,796 --> 00:36:39,731
We heard so much about it.

512
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:44,069
- Please.
- Oh!

513
00:36:44,103 --> 00:36:46,639
There it is.

514
00:36:47,941 --> 00:36:50,376
Oh.

515
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:53,079
Do you think we're ugly?

516
00:36:53,113 --> 00:36:55,147
He thinks we're ugly.

517
00:36:55,182 --> 00:36:57,083
Well, he's been
through so much.

518
00:36:57,117 --> 00:36:59,519
Look at his poor face.

519
00:37:01,055 --> 00:37:02,522
Help me.

520
00:37:03,857 --> 00:37:06,025
If he comes back...

521
00:37:07,995 --> 00:37:10,864
We need to make him
feel better.

522
00:37:10,898 --> 00:37:13,867
And how can we make
him feel better?

523
00:37:14,736 --> 00:37:16,603
I have an idea.

524
00:37:36,558 --> 00:37:39,760
Oh, she's shy.

525
00:37:39,795 --> 00:37:43,797
You know how they are,
these religious girls.

526
00:37:45,833 --> 00:37:48,001
Maybe he doesn't
know how we are.

527
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,614
Oh.

528
00:38:01,649 --> 00:38:03,583
I felt something.

529
00:38:07,054 --> 00:38:09,723
Oh, Lord Greyjoy.

530
00:38:12,226 --> 00:38:14,695
- As good as they say?
- Mmm.

531
00:38:24,373 --> 00:38:26,740
And why should you
get all the fun?

532
00:38:36,385 --> 00:38:39,920
What?
You like her better?

533
00:38:43,726 --> 00:38:45,760
Plenty there for both of us.

534
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,964
I was here first.

535
00:38:57,071 --> 00:39:00,406
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

536
00:39:00,441 --> 00:39:02,508
Terrible timing.

537
00:39:06,046 --> 00:39:08,213
But I was getting jealous.

538
00:39:12,319 --> 00:39:13,919
Well?

539
00:39:13,954 --> 00:39:17,490
Should we see this cock
everyone's always going on about?

540
00:39:29,403 --> 00:39:32,539
Everyone knows you love girls.

541
00:39:33,508 --> 00:39:36,510
I bet you always thought
they loved you back.

542
00:39:45,755 --> 00:39:49,125
Your famous cock must be
very precious to you.

543
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:53,129
Would you say it's
your most precious part?

544
00:39:56,233 --> 00:39:59,469
Please.

545
00:39:59,504 --> 00:40:02,438
No.

546
00:40:02,473 --> 00:40:04,541
<i>No!</i>
<i>Mercy, please!</i>

547
00:40:04,575 --> 00:40:06,543
<i>Please, mercy!</i>
<i>Mercy!</i>

548
00:40:06,577 --> 00:40:09,346
This is mercy.

549
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,581
I'm not killing you.

550
00:40:11,616 --> 00:40:15,686
<i>Just making a few alterations.</i>

551
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:20,291
No! No! No!

552
00:40:20,326 --> 00:40:22,127
Please, no! No!

553
00:40:22,161 --> 00:40:25,530
No! No, please!
Please!

554
00:40:28,333 --> 00:40:29,767
You're gonna scare it off.

555
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:32,670
I'm not gonna scare it.
I'm gonna kill it.

556
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:36,073
It's too far away.

557
00:40:59,062 --> 00:41:01,163
Is that a palace?

558
00:41:03,967 --> 00:41:05,634
It's a windmill.

559
00:41:06,503 --> 00:41:08,404
Windmill.

560
00:41:08,438 --> 00:41:11,941
Who built it?
Some king?

561
00:41:11,975 --> 00:41:14,310
Just the men
who used to live here.

562
00:41:14,344 --> 00:41:15,945
<i>They must have
been great builders,</i>

563
00:41:15,979 --> 00:41:18,214
<i>stacking stones so high.</i>

564
00:41:18,248 --> 00:41:21,317
Winterfell has towers
three times that size.

565
00:41:21,351 --> 00:41:24,253
"I'm Jon Snow
and I'm from Winterfell.

566
00:41:24,287 --> 00:41:25,454
My daddy was a fancy lord

567
00:41:25,489 --> 00:41:28,424
and I lived in a tower
that touched the clouds."

568
00:41:28,458 --> 00:41:30,427
If you're impressed
by a windmill,

569
00:41:30,461 --> 00:41:33,430
you'd be swooning if you saw
the Great Keep at Winterfell.

570
00:41:33,464 --> 00:41:35,299
What's swooning?

571
00:41:35,333 --> 00:41:37,134
Fainting.

572
00:41:37,169 --> 00:41:39,703
What's fainting?

573
00:41:42,474 --> 00:41:44,575
When a girl sees blood
and collapses.

574
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:46,778
Why would a girl
see blood and collapse?

575
00:41:46,812 --> 00:41:49,647
Well...

576
00:41:49,682 --> 00:41:51,882
not all girls are like you.

577
00:41:53,051 --> 00:41:55,086
Well, girls see
more blood than boys.

578
00:41:56,288 --> 00:41:59,189
Or do you like girls
who swoon, Jon Snow?

579
00:41:59,224 --> 00:42:00,957
Oh, a spider!

580
00:42:00,992 --> 00:42:03,526
Save me, Jon Snow.

581
00:42:03,561 --> 00:42:05,862
My dress is made
of the purest silk

582
00:42:05,896 --> 00:42:08,264
from Tralalalaleeday.

583
00:42:08,298 --> 00:42:10,866
I'd like to see you
in a silk dress.

584
00:42:13,003 --> 00:42:15,504
Would you?

585
00:42:17,707 --> 00:42:20,510
So I could tear it off you.

586
00:42:20,544 --> 00:42:23,479
Well, you rip
my pretty silk dress,

587
00:42:23,513 --> 00:42:25,648
I'll blacken your eye.

588
00:42:32,289 --> 00:42:35,424
Maybe one day I'll take
you to Winterfell.

589
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:39,395
Or maybe one day
I'll take you there.

590
00:42:39,429 --> 00:42:41,730
After we've taken
our land back.

591
00:42:44,901 --> 00:42:46,535
Ygritte.

592
00:42:49,606 --> 00:42:51,775
You won't win.

593
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:55,612
I know your people are brave,
no one denies that.

594
00:42:55,647 --> 00:42:58,849
- You know nothing--
- Six times in the last thousand years,

595
00:42:58,884 --> 00:43:01,152
a King-beyond-the-Wall
has attacked the kingdoms.

596
00:43:01,186 --> 00:43:04,823
- Six times they failed.
- And how do you know that?

597
00:43:04,857 --> 00:43:06,758
Every boy in the North
knows it.

598
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:08,227
We grow up learning it.

599
00:43:08,261 --> 00:43:09,628
Where the battles were fought,

600
00:43:09,662 --> 00:43:11,396
the names of the heroes,
who died where.

601
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:13,298
Six times you've invaded

602
00:43:13,332 --> 00:43:16,501
and six times you've failed.

603
00:43:16,535 --> 00:43:18,536
The seventh will be the same.

604
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:21,772
- Mance is different.
- You don't have the discipline.

605
00:43:21,806 --> 00:43:25,375
You don't have the training.
Your army is no army.

606
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:26,810
You don't know
how to fight together.

607
00:43:26,844 --> 00:43:29,346
- You don't know that.
- I do.

608
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:31,147
I know it.

609
00:43:31,181 --> 00:43:33,516
If you attack the Wall,
you'll die.

610
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:35,451
All of you.

611
00:43:43,594 --> 00:43:45,728
All of <i>us.</i>

612
00:44:01,612 --> 00:44:03,680
You're mine

613
00:44:03,714 --> 00:44:06,249
as I'm yours.

614
00:44:06,283 --> 00:44:08,818
And if we die, we die.

615
00:44:09,887 --> 00:44:12,322
But first we'll live.

616
00:44:12,356 --> 00:44:16,326
Yes, first we'll live.

617
00:44:32,777 --> 00:44:35,445
What's he going on about?

618
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,848
And how come he always
gets to sit and chat

619
00:44:37,882 --> 00:44:39,950
while we do all the work?

620
00:44:42,887 --> 00:44:44,522
Hodor.

621
00:44:46,158 --> 00:44:49,728
- That's where we are.
- What are you telling him?

622
00:44:49,762 --> 00:44:51,463
- It's all right, Osha.
- It's not all right.

623
00:44:51,497 --> 00:44:53,464
You think I can't
hear you every day?

624
00:44:53,499 --> 00:44:55,133
Filling his head
with black magic.

625
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:58,169
<i>Talking about visions and
three-eyed ravens and worse.</i>

626
00:44:58,204 --> 00:45:01,039
- Leave him alone.
- He can speak for himself.

627
00:45:01,074 --> 00:45:02,774
I don't fill his head
with anything.

628
00:45:02,808 --> 00:45:05,343
<i>So what do you talk about?</i>

629
00:45:05,378 --> 00:45:08,479
What's happening to him
and what that means.

630
00:45:08,514 --> 00:45:11,081
Go on, then.
Tell us what it means.

631
00:45:11,116 --> 00:45:12,683
It's not like that.

632
00:45:12,717 --> 00:45:14,484
<i>I wish I could</i>
<i>tell him all the answers.</i>

633
00:45:14,519 --> 00:45:16,887
<i>It would be much easier.</i>

634
00:45:16,921 --> 00:45:19,689
I don't want you
talking to him anymore.

635
00:45:19,724 --> 00:45:21,191
Until we get to your brother
at Castle Black.

636
00:45:21,225 --> 00:45:24,160
- We're not going to Castle Black.
- What did you say?

637
00:45:24,194 --> 00:45:27,696
I told you already.
Jon Snow isn't there.

638
00:45:27,731 --> 00:45:29,431
Bran needs to find
the raven beyond the Wall.

639
00:45:29,466 --> 00:45:31,100
Oh, no.
I'm not going back there.

640
00:45:31,134 --> 00:45:34,203
Your brother is at Castle Black.
That's where we're going.

641
00:45:35,939 --> 00:45:37,740
Look at me.

642
00:45:39,075 --> 00:45:41,043
The raven's been coming to me

643
00:45:41,078 --> 00:45:43,446
ever since I fell
from that tower.

644
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:46,249
He wants me to find him.

645
00:45:46,283 --> 00:45:49,652
I don't have my legs anymore.

646
00:45:49,687 --> 00:45:51,588
This is what I have now.

647
00:45:51,622 --> 00:45:53,790
You have a family.

648
00:45:53,824 --> 00:45:55,658
You need to go back
to Castle Black

649
00:45:55,693 --> 00:45:58,461
so you can get back to
them where you belong.

650
00:45:58,496 --> 00:46:01,465
What if I belong in the North?

651
00:46:01,499 --> 00:46:05,802
What if I fell from
that tower for a reason?

652
00:46:05,836 --> 00:46:08,038
Is that what he's telling you?

653
00:46:08,072 --> 00:46:10,240
That it's all for a reason?

654
00:46:10,274 --> 00:46:14,478
All these bad things happened because
the gods got big plans for you?

655
00:46:14,512 --> 00:46:16,480
I wish it were true,
little lord.

656
00:46:16,515 --> 00:46:20,685
But the gods wouldn't spare a raven's
cold shit for you or me or anyone.

657
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:22,987
You don't understand.
You don't know.

658
00:46:23,022 --> 00:46:24,989
You don't know.
None of you know.

659
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:27,258
None of you have been up there.

660
00:46:30,362 --> 00:46:32,696
I had a man once.

661
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:34,465
A good man.

662
00:46:34,499 --> 00:46:36,267
Bruni, his name was.

663
00:46:36,302 --> 00:46:39,304
I was his and he was mine.

664
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:42,306
But one night Bruni disappears.

665
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:44,942
People said he left me,

666
00:46:44,976 --> 00:46:46,310
but I knew him.

667
00:46:46,344 --> 00:46:50,280
<i>He'd never leave me.</i>
<i>Not for long.</i>

668
00:46:50,314 --> 00:46:52,683
I knew he'd come back.

669
00:46:54,352 --> 00:46:56,453
And he did.

670
00:46:57,689 --> 00:47:00,858
<i>He came in through</i>
<i>the back of the hut.</i>

671
00:47:01,727 --> 00:47:03,695
Only it wasn't Bruni.

672
00:47:03,729 --> 00:47:06,297
Not really.

673
00:47:06,332 --> 00:47:09,868
His skin was pale

674
00:47:09,902 --> 00:47:13,271
like a dead man's.

675
00:47:13,306 --> 00:47:16,141
His eyes bluer than clear sky.

676
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,648
<i>He came at me,</i>

677
00:47:21,682 --> 00:47:23,650
grabbed me by the neck

678
00:47:23,684 --> 00:47:26,520
and squeezed so hard

679
00:47:26,554 --> 00:47:29,390
I could feel the life
slipping out of me.

680
00:47:31,693 --> 00:47:34,128
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>how I got the knife.</i>

681
00:47:34,162 --> 00:47:37,065
<i>When I did, I stuck it</i>

682
00:47:37,099 --> 00:47:39,801
deep into his heart.

683
00:47:42,972 --> 00:47:45,740
And he hardly seemed to notice.

684
00:47:47,143 --> 00:47:51,446
<i>I had to burn our hut down</i>
<i>with him inside.</i>

685
00:47:53,849 --> 00:47:56,584
I didn't ask the gods
what it meant.

686
00:47:56,618 --> 00:48:00,354
I didn't need to.
I already knew.

687
00:48:00,389 --> 00:48:03,557
<i>It meant the North</i>
<i>was no place for men to be.</i>

688
00:48:03,592 --> 00:48:05,860
<i>Not anymore.</i>

689
00:48:08,197 --> 00:48:10,432
I promised your maester
I'd get you to Castle Black

690
00:48:10,466 --> 00:48:13,034
and no further.

691
00:48:21,343 --> 00:48:23,177
How is the
pain, my lord?

692
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:29,282
What's the purpose
of an arm with no hand?

693
00:48:32,986 --> 00:48:35,821
Well, we've stymied
the corruption.

694
00:48:35,856 --> 00:48:38,658
Yes, we've stymied
the corruption.

695
00:48:38,692 --> 00:48:40,760
You're a learned man.

696
00:48:40,794 --> 00:48:42,395
All the good it's done me.

697
00:48:42,429 --> 00:48:44,597
You did well
sewing up this mess.

698
00:48:44,631 --> 00:48:46,966
You're far better
at this sort of work

699
00:48:47,001 --> 00:48:49,669
than Grand Maester Pycelle.

700
00:48:49,704 --> 00:48:52,305
Faint praise, my lord.

701
00:48:53,741 --> 00:48:57,144
So why did the Citadel
take your chain?

702
00:48:57,178 --> 00:48:59,145
Did you fondle
one boy too many?

703
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:02,449
No, my lord.
That's not my weakness.

704
00:49:03,918 --> 00:49:06,219
What is?

705
00:49:08,489 --> 00:49:10,023
Curiosity.

706
00:49:10,057 --> 00:49:14,027
The only way to treat disease
is to understand disease.

707
00:49:14,061 --> 00:49:16,329
And the only way
to understand it

708
00:49:16,364 --> 00:49:18,732
is to study the afflicted.

709
00:49:18,766 --> 00:49:21,435
You performed experiments
on living men.

710
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:23,337
- On dying men.
- With their permission?

711
00:49:23,372 --> 00:49:26,408
My studies
have given me insight

712
00:49:26,442 --> 00:49:28,110
that has saved many lives.

713
00:49:28,144 --> 00:49:30,512
Dying paupers, I assume.

714
00:49:30,546 --> 00:49:34,115
Men with no families
to complain.

715
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:35,951
You found them moaning
in the poorhouse

716
00:49:35,985 --> 00:49:38,420
and had them carted
back to your garret

717
00:49:38,454 --> 00:49:41,723
and opened up their bellies
to see what was inside.

718
00:49:41,758 --> 00:49:44,192
How many men have
you killed, my lord?

719
00:49:44,227 --> 00:49:45,861
I don't know.

720
00:49:45,895 --> 00:49:49,031
50? 100?

721
00:49:50,801 --> 00:49:52,869
Countless.

722
00:49:52,903 --> 00:49:54,905
Countless has
a nice ring to it.

723
00:49:54,939 --> 00:49:57,241
And how many lives
have you saved?

724
00:49:57,275 --> 00:50:00,110
Half a million.

725
00:50:01,212 --> 00:50:03,547
The population
of King's Landing.

726
00:50:08,654 --> 00:50:12,156
You were in charge
of the ravens at Harrenhal.

727
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:16,393
Did you-- did you get a bird off
to Brienne's father in Tarth?

728
00:50:16,428 --> 00:50:19,029
A bird flew off
and a bird flew back.

729
00:50:20,264 --> 00:50:22,632
Lord Selwyn Tarth

730
00:50:22,667 --> 00:50:26,369
offered 300 gold dragons for
his daughter's safe return.

731
00:50:26,404 --> 00:50:30,240
- A fair offer.
- A fair offer. Locke won't take it.

732
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:33,811
Why not?

733
00:50:33,845 --> 00:50:35,212
He's convinced Lord Tarth

734
00:50:35,247 --> 00:50:37,948
owns all the sapphire
mines in Westeros.

735
00:50:39,384 --> 00:50:41,686
He feels he's being cheated.

736
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,889
They'd be fools to kill her.

737
00:50:43,923 --> 00:50:46,358
These men have been
at war a long time.

738
00:50:46,393 --> 00:50:48,560
Most of them
will be dead by winter.

739
00:50:48,595 --> 00:50:51,530
She'll be their
entertainment tonight.

740
00:50:51,564 --> 00:50:53,799
Beyond tonight,

741
00:50:53,833 --> 00:50:56,101
I don't think
they care very much.

742
00:51:15,254 --> 00:51:17,656
We have to return to Harrenhal.

743
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:19,123
Why?

744
00:51:19,158 --> 00:51:20,625
I've left something behind.

745
00:51:20,659 --> 00:51:22,260
Absolutely not.

746
00:51:22,294 --> 00:51:24,262
I've got orders
from Lord Bolton.

747
00:51:24,296 --> 00:51:25,830
And what are those orders?

748
00:51:25,864 --> 00:51:29,367
To deliver you to your
father at King's Landing.

749
00:51:29,401 --> 00:51:31,636
You think you'll get a reward.

750
00:51:33,672 --> 00:51:36,440
I serve Lord Bolton.

751
00:51:36,474 --> 00:51:38,008
Any appreciation
your father--

752
00:51:38,042 --> 00:51:39,376
You think
you're getting a reward.

753
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:40,710
Let me explain
something to you.

754
00:51:40,744 --> 00:51:42,745
When my father sees me,
the first thing

755
00:51:42,779 --> 00:51:45,147
he's going to ask
is what happened to my hand.

756
00:51:45,181 --> 00:51:48,417
And I'm going to tell him
this man chopped it off.

757
00:51:48,451 --> 00:51:52,287
- I had nothing--
- Or I could tell him this man saved my life.

758
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:56,559
We return to Harrenhal now.

759
00:52:15,879 --> 00:52:18,113
Whoa.

760
00:52:19,616 --> 00:52:22,018
- Eyes open, lads.
- Be quiet.

761
00:52:26,657 --> 00:52:30,227
<i>♪ The bear, the bear
and the maiden fair ♪</i>

762
00:52:30,261 --> 00:52:32,296
<i>♪ From there to here,</i>
<i>from here to there ♪</i>

763
00:52:32,330 --> 00:52:34,665
<i>♪ All black and brown</i>
<i>and covered in hair ♪</i>

764
00:52:34,699 --> 00:52:37,067
♪ He smelled that girl
in the summer air ♪

765
00:52:37,102 --> 00:52:39,303
♪ The bear, the bear,
and the maiden fair! ♪

766
00:52:43,775 --> 00:52:45,809
<i>Don't spare her.</i>

767
00:52:45,844 --> 00:52:48,378
<i>Don't spare her!</i>

768
00:52:50,081 --> 00:52:53,650
Well, this is one shameful
fucking performance.

769
00:52:53,685 --> 00:52:55,318
Stop running and fight.

770
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:04,395
A wooden sword?

771
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:07,232
- I thought you'd gone.
- You gave her a wooden sword.

772
00:53:07,266 --> 00:53:09,034
We've only got one bear.

773
00:53:09,068 --> 00:53:10,702
I'll pay her bloody ransom.

774
00:53:10,736 --> 00:53:12,704
Gold, sapphires,
whatever you want.

775
00:53:12,738 --> 00:53:14,339
Just get her out of there.

776
00:53:14,373 --> 00:53:16,741
All you lords and ladies

777
00:53:16,775 --> 00:53:19,677
still think that the only
thing that matters is gold.

778
00:53:19,711 --> 00:53:23,114
This makes me happier
than all your gold ever could.

779
00:53:23,148 --> 00:53:26,217
And that makes me happier
than all her sapphires.

780
00:53:26,251 --> 00:53:28,653
So go buy yourself
a golden hand

781
00:53:28,687 --> 00:53:31,322
and fuck yourself with it.

782
00:53:41,733 --> 00:53:43,868
Ah!

783
00:53:50,208 --> 00:53:51,742
- Get behind me.
- I will not.

784
00:54:02,653 --> 00:54:05,088
What the fuck are you
doing to my bear?

785
00:54:05,122 --> 00:54:07,023
Lord Bolton charged me
with bringing him back

786
00:54:07,057 --> 00:54:10,092
to King's Landing alive
and that's what I aim to do.

787
00:54:13,596 --> 00:54:15,530
Pull her up.

788
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:30,644
Hold my legs.

789
00:54:53,333 --> 00:54:55,101
Pull him up!

790
00:55:05,379 --> 00:55:07,514
The bitch stays.

791
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:12,018
We're taking her
to King's Landing.

792
00:55:12,052 --> 00:55:13,686
Unless you kill me.

793
00:55:16,190 --> 00:55:17,924
She belongs to me.

794
00:55:17,958 --> 00:55:20,860
Lord Bolton's orders.

795
00:55:20,894 --> 00:55:23,663
What do you think is more
important to Lord Bolton?

796
00:55:23,697 --> 00:55:25,398
Getting his pet rat a reward

797
00:55:25,432 --> 00:55:28,768
or ensuring Tywin Lannister
gets his son back alive?

798
00:55:49,091 --> 00:55:52,060
Well, we must be on our way.

799
00:55:55,598 --> 00:55:57,766
Sorry about the sapphires.

800
