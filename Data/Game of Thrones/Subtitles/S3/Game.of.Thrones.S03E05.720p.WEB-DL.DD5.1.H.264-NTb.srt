2
00:01:42,417 --> 00:01:47,817
3x05
Kissed by Fire

3
00:01:59,501 --> 00:02:04,554
Lord, cast your light upon us.

4
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:07,225
Lord of Light, defend us.

5
00:02:10,162 --> 00:02:11,996
Show us the truth.

6
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,397
Strike this man down
if he is guilty.

7
00:02:14,432 --> 00:02:16,899
Give strength to his sword
if he is true.

8
00:02:16,933 --> 00:02:21,036
<i>Lord of Light, give us wisdom.</i>

9
00:02:25,874 --> 00:02:28,409
For the night is dark

10
00:02:28,444 --> 00:02:29,911
and full of terrors.

11
00:02:29,945 --> 00:02:33,014
For the night is
dark and full of terrors.

12
00:03:54,675 --> 00:03:56,542
Get back.

13
00:04:23,637 --> 00:04:26,339
Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.

14
00:04:26,373 --> 00:04:29,108
Guilty. Guilty.
Guilty.

15
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:31,845
Guilty.
Guilty. Guilty.

16
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:34,781
Guilty. Guilty.
Guilty.

17
00:04:34,815 --> 00:04:36,249
Kill him!

18
00:04:54,971 --> 00:04:56,931
Lord, cast your light
upon this man, your servant.

19
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,807
Bring him back
from death and darkness.

20
00:04:58,842 --> 00:05:00,109
His flame has been
extinguished.

21
00:05:00,143 --> 00:05:01,877
Restore it.

22
00:05:01,912 --> 00:05:03,446
<i>For the night is
dark and full of terrors.</i>

23
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,715
- <i>Lord, cast...</i>
- Arya, don't!

24
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,184
Bring him back
from death and darkness...

25
00:05:08,219 --> 00:05:09,953
No!

26
00:05:09,987 --> 00:05:13,056
Let go of me!
Let me go!

27
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,192
Looks like their god likes me
more than your butcher's boy.

28
00:05:16,227 --> 00:05:17,827
Burn in hell!

29
00:05:17,861 --> 00:05:19,829
<i>He will.</i>

30
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:26,402
But not today.

31
00:05:49,563 --> 00:05:53,099
Orell says there are crows
patrolling on the Wall.

32
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:55,701
Tell me what you know.

33
00:05:55,735 --> 00:05:57,469
There are four
to a patrol--

34
00:05:57,504 --> 00:05:59,371
two builders to check
for structural damage,

35
00:05:59,405 --> 00:06:00,839
two rangers to watch
for enemies.

36
00:06:00,873 --> 00:06:02,941
How often do these
patrols go out?

37
00:06:04,243 --> 00:06:05,877
It varies.

38
00:06:05,911 --> 00:06:08,547
If I knew where on the Wall we
were heading, I could tell you.

39
00:06:08,581 --> 00:06:11,050
You'd like to know that.

40
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:15,555
There are 19 castles
guarding the Wall.

41
00:06:17,024 --> 00:06:19,392
How many are manned?

42
00:06:19,426 --> 00:06:21,762
Three.

43
00:06:21,796 --> 00:06:24,465
You sure of that?

44
00:06:26,134 --> 00:06:27,735
Which three?

45
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:31,906
Castle Black.

46
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,774
Aye, Castle Black.

47
00:06:33,808 --> 00:06:35,909
Everyone knows Castle Black.

48
00:06:35,944 --> 00:06:37,944
Which others?

49
00:06:43,183 --> 00:06:45,552
Eastwatch-by-the-Sea

50
00:06:45,586 --> 00:06:48,488
and the Shadow Tower.

51
00:06:50,557 --> 00:06:52,725
How many men remain
in Castle Black?

52
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,494
- 1,000.
- Liar.

53
00:06:56,564 --> 00:06:58,665
What happens to your eagle
after I kill you?

54
00:06:58,699 --> 00:07:01,234
Does he drift away like a
kite with his strings cut

55
00:07:01,268 --> 00:07:03,569
or does he just flop
dead to the ground?

56
00:07:03,604 --> 00:07:05,104
He's no crow.

57
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:07,507
Just 'cause you want him inside
you don't make him one of us.

58
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:10,043
I'm not afraid of you.

59
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,217
I like you, boy.

60
00:07:18,252 --> 00:07:21,154
But if you lie to me,

61
00:07:21,188 --> 00:07:24,424
I'll pull your guts out
through your throat.

62
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,961
1,000 men.

63
00:07:33,967 --> 00:07:36,836
We'll find out soon enough.

64
00:07:43,777 --> 00:07:45,411
I don't need you to protect me.

65
00:07:45,446 --> 00:07:46,846
Of course you do.

66
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,715
Who stopped Rattleshirt when he
was about to cut your throat?

67
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,551
Who vouched for you with Mance?

68
00:07:52,586 --> 00:07:54,620
It seems you owe me a debt.

69
00:07:55,989 --> 00:07:58,491
- Give it back.
- Well, I stole it.

70
00:07:58,525 --> 00:08:02,227
It's mine. If you want
it, come steal it back.

71
00:08:04,297 --> 00:08:06,031
<i>Ygritte!</i>

72
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,134
<i>Ygritte!</i>

73
00:08:12,739 --> 00:08:15,407
Ygritte!
Seven hells.

74
00:08:15,441 --> 00:08:17,576
<i>Ygritte!</i>

75
00:08:21,114 --> 00:08:23,483
Is Orell right?

76
00:08:23,517 --> 00:08:25,485
Are you still a crow?

77
00:08:26,921 --> 00:08:30,256
It's time you proved yourself.

78
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,025
Ygritte.

79
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:34,661
You swore some vows.

80
00:08:34,695 --> 00:08:36,596
I want you to break 'em.

81
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,867
I want you to see me.

82
00:08:44,404 --> 00:08:46,705
All of me.

83
00:09:00,353 --> 00:09:02,154
We shouldn't.

84
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:06,425
We should.

85
00:09:26,145 --> 00:09:28,380
Why are you still dressed?

86
00:09:28,415 --> 00:09:30,916
You know nothing,
Jon Sno--

87
00:09:46,032 --> 00:09:47,966
That thing you did

88
00:09:48,001 --> 00:09:49,968
with your mouth--

89
00:09:51,504 --> 00:09:54,340
is that what lords do to
their ladies in the South?

90
00:09:54,374 --> 00:09:56,509
I don't know.

91
00:09:56,543 --> 00:09:58,311
I just wanted to kiss
you there is all.

92
00:09:58,379 --> 00:09:59,813
Hmm.

93
00:09:59,847 --> 00:10:01,548
You seemed to like it.

94
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,984
Aye, I liked it some.

95
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:05,586
Who taught you that?

96
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:08,489
There's been no one else.
Only you.

97
00:10:08,523 --> 00:10:10,424
A maid.

98
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,293
You were a maid.

99
00:10:12,327 --> 00:10:15,229
I was a man
of the Night's Watch.

100
00:10:16,931 --> 00:10:19,166
How about you?
Were you a maid?

101
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,601
What do you think?

102
00:10:20,635 --> 00:10:23,503
- Who was he?
- Just a boy.

103
00:10:23,538 --> 00:10:26,139
He came trading
with his brothers.

104
00:10:26,174 --> 00:10:29,342
He had red hair like me.
Kissed by fire.

105
00:10:29,377 --> 00:10:31,277
But...

106
00:10:31,345 --> 00:10:33,813
he was weak.

107
00:10:33,848 --> 00:10:35,548
Not like you.

108
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,517
That was the first one.

109
00:10:37,552 --> 00:10:39,520
Then there was this Thenn boy.

110
00:10:39,554 --> 00:10:42,990
Spoke no Common, but gods,
he was built like a mammoth.

111
00:10:43,025 --> 00:10:46,193
Yeah, thanks.
I think I've heard enough.

112
00:10:48,964 --> 00:10:50,831
We'd best get back.

113
00:10:50,866 --> 00:10:53,234
Tormund--

114
00:10:55,537 --> 00:10:57,572
I'm not done with you yet.

115
00:11:04,613 --> 00:11:07,014
How long's it been
since you had a bath?

116
00:11:22,697 --> 00:11:24,665
Let's not go back.

117
00:11:25,967 --> 00:11:28,569
Let's stay here a while longer.

118
00:11:30,972 --> 00:11:34,241
I don't ever want to leave
this cave, Jon Snow.

119
00:11:36,377 --> 00:11:38,411
Not ever.

120
00:11:48,757 --> 00:11:50,458
<i>I want my gold.</i>

121
00:11:50,492 --> 00:11:51,926
It says it clearly
right there on that note

122
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,528
you'll be repaid in full
when the war is over.

123
00:11:53,562 --> 00:11:55,897
Piss on that!
You're nothing but thieves.

124
00:11:55,931 --> 00:11:58,132
We're outlaws.
Outlaws steal.

125
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,667
You're lucky
we didn't kill you.

126
00:11:59,701 --> 00:12:00,668
Come try it, archer.

127
00:12:00,703 --> 00:12:02,303
I'll shove those arrows
up your ass.

128
00:12:02,337 --> 00:12:04,873
You can't let him go. He's a murderer.
He's guilty.

129
00:12:04,907 --> 00:12:07,041
- Not in the eyes of god.
- You can't!

130
00:12:07,076 --> 00:12:10,245
Enough! The judgment
isn't ours to make.

131
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:16,084
Go in peace, Sandor Clegane.

132
00:12:16,119 --> 00:12:17,852
The Lord of Light
isn't done with you yet.

133
00:12:22,892 --> 00:12:25,826
<i>Riders coming through!</i>

134
00:12:36,472 --> 00:12:37,939
The Kingslayer.

135
00:12:37,974 --> 00:12:39,041
Down!

136
00:12:39,075 --> 00:12:41,243
On your knees.

137
00:12:41,277 --> 00:12:44,380
Lord Bolton, I give you
the Kingslayer.

138
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,984
Pick him up, Locke.

139
00:12:54,592 --> 00:12:56,059
You've lost a hand.

140
00:12:56,093 --> 00:12:58,928
No, my lord, he has it here.

141
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,366
- Take this away.
- Send it to his father?

142
00:13:04,401 --> 00:13:06,502
You'll hold your tongue
unless you want to lose it.

143
00:13:07,604 --> 00:13:10,206
Cut her free.
Apologies, my lady.

144
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,274
You're under my protection now.

145
00:13:12,308 --> 00:13:14,944
Thank you, my lord.

146
00:13:18,148 --> 00:13:20,249
Find suitable rooms
for our guests.

147
00:13:20,284 --> 00:13:23,019
We'll speak later.

148
00:13:24,655 --> 00:13:26,156
Lord Bolton.

149
00:13:29,994 --> 00:13:32,028
Is there word from the capital?

150
00:13:33,264 --> 00:13:34,831
You haven't heard?

151
00:13:36,401 --> 00:13:39,002
Stannis Baratheon laid siege
to King's Landing.

152
00:13:39,036 --> 00:13:41,471
<i>Sailed into Blackwater Bay.</i>

153
00:13:41,506 --> 00:13:44,742
<i>Stormed the gates</i>
<i>with thousands of men.</i>

154
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:47,778
And your sister...

155
00:13:53,151 --> 00:13:55,252
How can I put this?

156
00:13:57,455 --> 00:13:59,189
Your sister...

157
00:14:00,558 --> 00:14:02,726
is alive and well.

158
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,562
Your father's forces prevailed.

159
00:14:07,297 --> 00:14:09,165
Ser Jaime isn't well.

160
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,634
Take him to Qyburn.

161
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,455
- Will I die?
- No.

162
00:14:33,489 --> 00:14:34,890
The corruption has spread.

163
00:14:34,924 --> 00:14:36,925
I fear it must be cut away.

164
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,028
The safest course would be
to take the whole arm off.

165
00:14:40,063 --> 00:14:42,497
Then you'll die.

166
00:14:44,067 --> 00:14:46,502
You're no maester.

167
00:14:46,536 --> 00:14:49,271
Where's your chain?

168
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:51,373
The Citadel stripped me of it.

169
00:14:51,408 --> 00:14:54,643
They found some
of my experiments

170
00:14:54,711 --> 00:14:56,645
too bold.

171
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,317
I can leave your upper arm,
make the cut at your elbow.

172
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:04,121
I don't need my right hand
to kill you.

173
00:15:05,189 --> 00:15:07,591
I can take away
the rotting flesh

174
00:15:07,626 --> 00:15:10,294
and try and burn out
the corruption

175
00:15:10,328 --> 00:15:12,563
- with boiling wine.
- Mmm.

176
00:15:12,597 --> 00:15:14,798
With any luck,
that will suffice.

177
00:15:14,866 --> 00:15:17,334
You'll need milk of the poppy.

178
00:15:18,637 --> 00:15:20,637
- No milk of the poppy.
- There will be pain.

179
00:15:20,672 --> 00:15:23,841
- I'll scream.
- Quite a bit of pain.

180
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,977
I'll scream loudly.

181
00:16:00,713 --> 00:16:02,347
Lord Baelish.

182
00:16:02,381 --> 00:16:04,015
Your Grace.

183
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:06,017
I wonder if I might
ask you for a favor.

184
00:16:06,051 --> 00:16:07,452
Of course, Your Grace.

185
00:16:07,486 --> 00:16:08,886
I have reason to believe
that House Tyrell

186
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,955
do not hold the crown's
best interests at heart.

187
00:16:10,989 --> 00:16:15,459
I see. And have you shared these
suspicions with Lord Tywin?

188
00:16:15,493 --> 00:16:18,428
My father's a practical man.
He appreciates facts.

189
00:16:18,463 --> 00:16:21,131
Myself, I often
find them a hindrance.

190
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:24,268
And he appreciates those who aid
his family, as you well know.

191
00:16:24,303 --> 00:16:25,837
He's almost as generous
to those who help us

192
00:16:25,871 --> 00:16:29,073
as he is unpleasant
towards those who don't.

193
00:16:29,107 --> 00:16:31,574
You have a good working
relationship with the Tyrells.

194
00:16:31,609 --> 00:16:34,510
I thought you might look into it
before you leave the capital.

195
00:16:34,545 --> 00:16:36,712
- I shall do my best.
- Thank you.

196
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:40,216
And your best will prove better than
when I asked you to locate Arya Stark?

197
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,018
I assure you that it will.

198
00:16:49,292 --> 00:16:51,626
Gods, boy, that's enough.
We're not in a tavern.

199
00:16:51,661 --> 00:16:53,061
- Pardon, my lady.
- No need to speak.

200
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:55,297
Are there any figs?
Fetch some.

201
00:16:55,331 --> 00:16:57,433
I always take figs
midafternoon.

202
00:16:57,467 --> 00:16:58,934
They help move the bowels.

203
00:16:58,969 --> 00:17:01,036
To what do I owe this summons?

204
00:17:01,071 --> 00:17:03,105
Thank you for seeing me,
my lady.

205
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,374
I had hoped we might discuss
a few financial matters.

206
00:17:05,408 --> 00:17:09,178
I climbed all those steps to
discuss financial matters?

207
00:17:09,212 --> 00:17:10,479
It's the royal wedding.

208
00:17:10,513 --> 00:17:11,914
I'm told you had a hand
in planning it.

209
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,115
Naturally.

210
00:17:13,149 --> 00:17:15,617
It's shaping up to be
a very involved affair.

211
00:17:15,651 --> 00:17:17,752
The word extravagant
has been used.

212
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:19,454
What good
is the word extravagant

213
00:17:19,488 --> 00:17:21,890
if it can't be used
to describe a royal wedding?

214
00:17:21,924 --> 00:17:23,992
- I understand that.
- Good.

215
00:17:24,026 --> 00:17:26,494
But, as Master of Coin,
it falls upon me

216
00:17:26,528 --> 00:17:28,162
to calculate the cost
for the crown.

217
00:17:28,197 --> 00:17:30,699
As of now, it's a huge expense.

218
00:17:30,733 --> 00:17:31,866
And?

219
00:17:31,901 --> 00:17:35,570
And we're at war, Lady Olenna.

220
00:17:35,604 --> 00:17:37,973
Oh, I'd nearly forgotten.

221
00:17:38,007 --> 00:17:39,374
Yes, and maintaining
supply lines--

222
00:17:39,408 --> 00:17:41,142
<i>I can't think</i>
<i>how it slipped my mind.</i>

223
00:17:41,177 --> 00:17:43,778
What is it, 12,000 infantrymen

224
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,613
<i>the Tyrell family has supplied?</i>

225
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,915
1,800 mounted lances.

226
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,917
<i>2,000 in support.</i>

227
00:17:49,952 --> 00:17:53,054
Provisions so this city
might survive the winter.

228
00:17:53,088 --> 00:17:54,789
<i>A million bushels of wheat.</i>

229
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:58,359
Half a million bushels each
of barley, oats, and rye.

230
00:17:58,394 --> 00:18:00,161
<i>20,000 head of cattle.</i>

231
00:18:00,196 --> 00:18:01,763
<i>50,000 sheep.</i>

232
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:04,266
You don't have to lecture me
about wartime expenses.

233
00:18:04,301 --> 00:18:06,302
I'm quite familiar with them.

234
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:08,004
And we are so grateful
for your contributions

235
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:10,573
which are necessary for the
preservation of the realm.

236
00:18:10,641 --> 00:18:12,476
As is a royal wedding.

237
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:15,079
The people are hungry
for more than just food.

238
00:18:15,113 --> 00:18:16,547
They crave distractions.

239
00:18:16,581 --> 00:18:19,850
And if we don't provide them,
they'll create their own.

240
00:18:19,885 --> 00:18:22,520
And their distractions
are likely to end

241
00:18:22,554 --> 00:18:24,822
with us being torn to pieces.

242
00:18:24,857 --> 00:18:27,191
<i>A royal wedding is much safer.</i>

243
00:18:27,226 --> 00:18:30,261
- Wouldn't you say?
- I would.

244
00:18:30,296 --> 00:18:32,463
<i>And traditionally paid for</i>

245
00:18:32,498 --> 00:18:34,566
by the royal family.

246
00:18:35,868 --> 00:18:38,236
I was told you were
drunk, impertinent,

247
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,271
and thoroughly debauched.

248
00:18:40,306 --> 00:18:41,873
You can imagine
my disappointment

249
00:18:41,908 --> 00:18:44,876
at finding nothing but a
browbeaten bookkeeper.

250
00:18:46,779 --> 00:18:49,347
Where did you go
for them, Volantis?

251
00:18:50,449 --> 00:18:52,283
- My lady--
- Oh, very well.

252
00:18:52,318 --> 00:18:54,319
I won't have it said
that House Tyrell

253
00:18:54,353 --> 00:18:56,054
refuses to play its part.

254
00:18:56,088 --> 00:18:57,622
We'll pay for half the expenses

255
00:18:57,657 --> 00:19:00,291
and the celebrations
will go on as planned.

256
00:19:00,326 --> 00:19:02,126
- Is that sufficient?
- Quite sufficient. Thank you.

257
00:19:02,161 --> 00:19:04,496
Very good, then. That's settled.
Good day.

258
00:19:07,566 --> 00:19:09,634
Give me that.

259
00:19:14,473 --> 00:19:16,274
<i>What are you doing?</i>

260
00:19:17,377 --> 00:19:19,411
Just mending
Lord Beric's armor.

261
00:19:19,445 --> 00:19:21,647
Why?

262
00:19:21,681 --> 00:19:24,082
I'm going to stay on
and smith for the Brotherhood.

263
00:19:24,116 --> 00:19:25,984
Have you lost your mind?

264
00:19:26,018 --> 00:19:29,521
When the Lannisters find this place,
you think they'll spare the smiths?

265
00:19:29,555 --> 00:19:31,156
They'll cave your head in
with your own helmet.

266
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:33,958
The Lannisters wanted to kill me long
before I joined the Brotherhood.

267
00:19:33,992 --> 00:19:35,927
You don't have to do this.

268
00:19:35,961 --> 00:19:37,762
I want to.

269
00:19:37,796 --> 00:19:39,230
They need good men.

270
00:19:39,265 --> 00:19:42,567
Robb needs good men, too.
We're leaving tomorrow.

271
00:19:42,601 --> 00:19:44,969
- And then you--
- What? Serve him?

272
00:19:46,038 --> 00:19:49,040
I've served men my entire life.

273
00:19:49,074 --> 00:19:50,875
I served Master Mott
at King's Landing

274
00:19:50,909 --> 00:19:53,511
and he sold me to the Watch.

275
00:19:53,545 --> 00:19:55,146
I served Lord Tywin
at Harrenhal,

276
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:58,115
wondering every day if I'd
get tortured or killed.

277
00:19:59,317 --> 00:20:00,551
I'm done serving.

278
00:20:00,585 --> 00:20:02,920
You just said you were
serving Lord Beric.

279
00:20:04,189 --> 00:20:07,724
He may be their leader,
but they chose him.

280
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:10,894
These men are brothers.
They're a family.

281
00:20:12,698 --> 00:20:14,498
I've never had a family.

282
00:20:17,436 --> 00:20:19,170
I can be your family.

283
00:20:22,241 --> 00:20:25,043
You wouldn't be my family.

284
00:20:25,077 --> 00:20:26,678
You'd be "my lady."

285
00:20:45,532 --> 00:20:47,366
Willem.

286
00:20:49,936 --> 00:20:51,537
Willem!

287
00:20:54,575 --> 00:20:57,911
- Is this a rescue?
- Lannister filth! Take him!

288
00:20:57,945 --> 00:21:00,313
Please, I didn't do anything.
I'm just a squire.

289
00:21:00,348 --> 00:21:02,148
Please--

290
00:21:14,929 --> 00:21:16,363
Bring them in.

291
00:21:32,746 --> 00:21:34,346
Is that all of them?

292
00:21:36,616 --> 00:21:39,686
It took five of you to
murder two unarmed squires?

293
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,621
Not murder, Your Grace.

294
00:21:41,655 --> 00:21:43,189
Vengeance.

295
00:21:43,223 --> 00:21:45,725
Vengeance?

296
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:48,127
Those boys didn't
kill your sons.

297
00:21:48,161 --> 00:21:51,230
I saw Harrion die on the
battlefield and Torrhen--

298
00:21:51,264 --> 00:21:53,265
Was strangled
by the Kingslayer.

299
00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:55,567
- They were his kin.
- They were boys!

300
00:21:57,736 --> 00:21:59,504
Look at them.

301
00:22:01,306 --> 00:22:02,940
Tell your mother
to look at them.

302
00:22:02,975 --> 00:22:05,276
<i>She killed them as much as I.</i>

303
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:07,945
My mother had nothing
to do with this.

304
00:22:07,979 --> 00:22:09,813
This was your treason.

305
00:22:09,848 --> 00:22:12,282
It's treason
to free your enemies.

306
00:22:12,316 --> 00:22:14,417
In war, you kill your enemies.

307
00:22:14,451 --> 00:22:16,553
Did your father
not teach you that, boy?

308
00:22:16,587 --> 00:22:18,621
Leave him.

309
00:22:22,793 --> 00:22:24,394
Aye.

310
00:22:24,428 --> 00:22:26,762
Leave me to the king.

311
00:22:26,797 --> 00:22:30,433
He wants to give me a scolding
before he sets me free.

312
00:22:31,535 --> 00:22:34,937
That's how he deals
with treason.

313
00:22:34,972 --> 00:22:37,273
Our King in the North.

314
00:22:37,307 --> 00:22:39,675
Or should I call him

315
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:42,745
the King Who Lost the North?

316
00:22:45,549 --> 00:22:48,083
Escort Lord Karstark
to the dungeon.

317
00:22:48,118 --> 00:22:49,818
Hang the rest.

318
00:22:49,853 --> 00:22:51,320
Mercy, sire!
I didn't kill anyone.

319
00:22:51,355 --> 00:22:52,822
I only watched for the guards.

320
00:22:52,856 --> 00:22:54,991
This one was only the watcher.

321
00:22:55,025 --> 00:22:57,093
Hang him last so he can
watch the others die.

322
00:22:57,127 --> 00:22:59,229
<i>Please! Please, no.
They made me do it!</i>

323
00:22:59,263 --> 00:23:03,199
They made me!
They made me!

324
00:23:11,275 --> 00:23:13,710
Word of this
can't leave Riverrun.

325
00:23:13,744 --> 00:23:15,612
They were Tywin
Lannister's nephews.

326
00:23:15,646 --> 00:23:17,347
The Lannisters pay their debts.

327
00:23:17,381 --> 00:23:18,782
<i>They never stop</i>
<i>talking about it.</i>

328
00:23:18,816 --> 00:23:20,751
Would you make me a liar
as well as a murderer?

329
00:23:20,785 --> 00:23:22,519
It wouldn't be lying.

330
00:23:22,553 --> 00:23:24,754
We will bury them
and remain silent

331
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:26,189
<i>until the war is done.</i>

332
00:23:26,223 --> 00:23:27,624
I'm not fighting for justice

333
00:23:27,658 --> 00:23:30,527
if I don't serve justice
to murderers in my ranks,

334
00:23:30,561 --> 00:23:33,497
<i>no matter how highborn.</i>

335
00:23:33,531 --> 00:23:36,100
He has to die.

336
00:23:36,134 --> 00:23:38,836
The Karstarks are Northmen.

337
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:41,205
They won't forgive
the killing of their lord.

338
00:23:41,239 --> 00:23:43,207
Your mother's right.

339
00:23:43,241 --> 00:23:46,010
If you do this, the
Karstarks will abandon you.

340
00:23:46,044 --> 00:23:48,112
You tended to their wounds.

341
00:23:48,147 --> 00:23:50,849
You brought them supper.
Now they're dead.

342
00:23:50,883 --> 00:23:54,720
And more boys will keep dying
until this war is over.

343
00:23:54,754 --> 00:23:56,889
<i>You need Karstark men</i>
<i>to end it.</i>

344
00:23:56,923 --> 00:23:59,358
Spare his life.
Keep him as a hostage.

345
00:23:59,392 --> 00:24:01,460
A hostage.

346
00:24:01,495 --> 00:24:04,798
<i>Tell the Karstarks that as
long as they remain loyal,</i>

347
00:24:04,832 --> 00:24:06,900
he will not be harmed.

348
00:24:31,926 --> 00:24:35,195
The blood of the First Men
flows through my veins

349
00:24:35,229 --> 00:24:38,231
as much as yours, boy.

350
00:24:38,266 --> 00:24:40,967
I fought the Mad King
for your father.

351
00:24:41,001 --> 00:24:44,605
I fought Joffrey for you.

352
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,107
We are kin--

353
00:24:46,141 --> 00:24:48,442
Stark and Karstark.

354
00:24:48,476 --> 00:24:50,877
That didn't stop you
from betraying me.

355
00:24:50,912 --> 00:24:52,479
And it won't save you now.

356
00:24:52,513 --> 00:24:55,381
I don't want it to save me.

357
00:24:55,416 --> 00:24:59,052
I want it to haunt you
to the end of your days.

358
00:24:59,987 --> 00:25:01,721
Kneel, my lord.

359
00:25:10,698 --> 00:25:13,199
Rickard Karstark,

360
00:25:13,234 --> 00:25:14,801
<i>Lord of Karhold,</i>

361
00:25:14,836 --> 00:25:18,339
here in sight of gods and
men, I sentence you to die.

362
00:25:18,373 --> 00:25:21,275
Would you speak a final word?

363
00:25:22,411 --> 00:25:24,946
Kill me and be cursed.

364
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:28,083
You are no king of mine.

365
00:25:42,131 --> 00:25:44,699
<i>Joffrey.</i>

366
00:25:44,733 --> 00:25:46,734
Cersei.

367
00:25:48,404 --> 00:25:50,405
Ilyn Payne.

368
00:25:51,975 --> 00:25:53,976
Ser Meryn.

369
00:25:57,114 --> 00:25:59,182
The Hound.

370
00:26:02,653 --> 00:26:04,621
What are you
going to do with me?

371
00:26:04,656 --> 00:26:07,291
At first light
we'll ride for Riverrun.

372
00:26:07,325 --> 00:26:09,159
Your brother's there now.

373
00:26:09,194 --> 00:26:11,662
He'll make a contribution
to our cause

374
00:26:11,696 --> 00:26:13,364
and you can go home.

375
00:26:13,398 --> 00:26:16,133
I'm a hostage
and you're selling me.

376
00:26:16,168 --> 00:26:17,602
Don't think of it that way.

377
00:26:17,636 --> 00:26:20,304
- But it is that way.
- <i>It is.</i>

378
00:26:20,339 --> 00:26:23,173
- And it isn't.
- More is than isn't.

379
00:26:25,143 --> 00:26:28,312
Beric admired your father
a great deal, you know.

380
00:26:28,346 --> 00:26:30,481
He wanted to refuse
your ransom altogether.

381
00:26:30,515 --> 00:26:34,017
- So why don't you?
- We need the gold.

382
00:26:46,131 --> 00:26:47,798
Do I frighten you, child?

383
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:49,667
No.

384
00:26:52,504 --> 00:26:54,238
You're angry with me.

385
00:26:54,272 --> 00:26:55,906
And I don't blame you.

386
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,460
But letting him go
was the right thing.

387
00:26:57,475 --> 00:27:00,044
I have more reason than most
to want him hanged.

388
00:27:00,078 --> 00:27:02,579
- I thought he killed you.
- He did.

389
00:27:02,614 --> 00:27:04,448
But how...?

390
00:27:04,482 --> 00:27:06,650
Thoros...

391
00:27:06,684 --> 00:27:08,552
how many times
have you brought me back?

392
00:27:08,586 --> 00:27:12,055
It's the Lord of Light
brings you back.

393
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:14,323
I'm just the lucky drunk
who says the words.

394
00:27:14,358 --> 00:27:16,992
- How many times?
- <i>Five, I think.</i>

395
00:27:17,027 --> 00:27:19,161
<i>No, this makes six.</i>

396
00:27:19,195 --> 00:27:20,529
Six.

397
00:27:20,563 --> 00:27:23,532
There was the first time--
the Mountain.

398
00:27:23,566 --> 00:27:25,100
<i>Show her.</i>

399
00:27:25,134 --> 00:27:28,903
Lance right through the chest.

400
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:31,373
Then I was stabbed
in the belly.

401
00:27:31,407 --> 00:27:32,774
Then it was an arrow
in the back.

402
00:27:32,808 --> 00:27:35,543
<i>And that axe in the side.</i>

403
00:27:35,578 --> 00:27:38,913
Then the Lannisters caught me
and executed me for treason.

404
00:27:40,449 --> 00:27:42,784
Was it a hanging
or a dagger in the eye?

405
00:27:42,851 --> 00:27:45,987
Both.
Fuckers couldn't decide.

406
00:27:46,021 --> 00:27:48,556
<i>And the Hound makes six.</i>

407
00:27:48,591 --> 00:27:50,726
Second time I've been
killed by a Clegane.

408
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,761
<i>You'd think you'd learn.</i>

409
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:56,999
It's not getting
any easier, you know.

410
00:27:57,033 --> 00:27:59,034
<i>I know.</i>

411
00:27:59,068 --> 00:28:01,169
<i>Every time I come back,</i>

412
00:28:01,204 --> 00:28:03,238
I'm a bit less.

413
00:28:04,908 --> 00:28:07,242
Pieces of you get chipped away.

414
00:28:08,744 --> 00:28:11,046
Could you bring back
a man without a head?

415
00:28:13,048 --> 00:28:16,684
Not six times.
Just once.

416
00:28:16,719 --> 00:28:19,621
I don't think it works
that way, child.

417
00:28:24,594 --> 00:28:28,197
He was a good man, Ned Stark.

418
00:28:28,231 --> 00:28:32,134
<i>He's at rest now, somewhere.</i>

419
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:34,569
I would never wish
my life upon him.

420
00:28:34,604 --> 00:28:36,738
I would.

421
00:28:39,042 --> 00:28:41,143
You're alive.

422
00:28:46,148 --> 00:28:49,150
Lord, cast your light upon me.

423
00:28:50,185 --> 00:28:53,555
Protect me in the darkness.

424
00:28:53,589 --> 00:28:57,092
Burn away my sins.

425
00:28:57,126 --> 00:29:00,362
Help me serve you.

426
00:29:00,397 --> 00:29:02,565
Use me as you will.

427
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:07,637
For the night is dark

428
00:29:07,672 --> 00:29:10,173
and full of terrors.

429
00:29:21,252 --> 00:29:24,154
I have prayed day and night
for you to come to me.

430
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,858
My lady.

431
00:29:27,892 --> 00:29:30,727
I meant to come sooner.

432
00:29:30,761 --> 00:29:33,997
- The battle--
- I know of your troubles, my king.

433
00:29:34,031 --> 00:29:36,767
The Lady Melisandre
has told me everything.

434
00:29:36,801 --> 00:29:39,303
Yes, of course.

435
00:29:48,548 --> 00:29:51,817
You mustn't despair.
Your claim is true.

436
00:29:51,851 --> 00:29:54,619
- You will be victorious.
- I believed that once.

437
00:29:54,654 --> 00:29:58,090
You are the one god's champion

438
00:29:58,124 --> 00:30:00,359
and the finest man
I've ever known.

439
00:30:00,393 --> 00:30:02,861
Selyse.

440
00:30:04,163 --> 00:30:06,698
I've broken a sacred vow.

441
00:30:10,169 --> 00:30:11,537
I've sinned.

442
00:30:11,571 --> 00:30:14,707
- No.
- I've wronged you.

443
00:30:14,741 --> 00:30:18,344
- I have shamed you.
- You're doing god's work.

444
00:30:18,379 --> 00:30:20,447
You don't understand.

445
00:30:26,087 --> 00:30:28,155
The Red Woman--

446
00:30:29,825 --> 00:30:31,625
the Lady Melisandre--

447
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,627
I know, Stannis.

448
00:30:33,662 --> 00:30:37,698
The Lady Melisandre
has told me everything.

449
00:30:37,732 --> 00:30:40,968
No act done in service
of the Lord of Light

450
00:30:41,003 --> 00:30:43,771
can ever be a sin.

451
00:30:43,805 --> 00:30:47,075
When she told me,

452
00:30:47,109 --> 00:30:51,312
I wept with joy.

453
00:31:01,791 --> 00:31:05,460
Oh, my sweet boys.

454
00:31:06,962 --> 00:31:10,632
<i>Petyr, Tommard,</i>

455
00:31:10,666 --> 00:31:12,668
<i>Edric.</i>

456
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:17,506
I thank god every day

457
00:31:17,541 --> 00:31:20,577
<i>for bringing Melisandre to us.</i>

458
00:31:20,611 --> 00:31:22,946
She gave you a son.

459
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:26,917
I gave you...

460
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:30,520
- <i>nothing.</i>
- That's not true.

461
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:37,960
So you've come
to see her as well?

462
00:31:40,396 --> 00:31:42,330
There is no need.

463
00:31:43,733 --> 00:31:46,300
You must keep away
from such distractions.

464
00:31:46,335 --> 00:31:48,035
She's my daughter.

465
00:31:50,305 --> 00:31:51,672
I want to see her.

466
00:31:54,376 --> 00:31:57,012
You are a king.

467
00:31:57,046 --> 00:31:59,848
You don't need my permission.

Father!

477
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,620
You've grown
since I last saw you.

478
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:41,158
Mother said you fought
in a battle.

479
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:42,760
Did you win?

480
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:46,063
No.

481
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:48,532
Did the Onion Knight
come back with you?

482
00:32:49,868 --> 00:32:52,002
He did.

483
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:53,771
He fought bravely.

484
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,472
He hasn't come to visit me.

485
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:58,508
He said he'd bring me back a
present from the capital.

486
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:00,210
He won't be visiting, child.

487
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:02,778
Why not?
He's my friend.

488
00:33:02,813 --> 00:33:04,380
Look.

489
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,588
He made this for me.

490
00:33:13,623 --> 00:33:15,991
But don't tell Mother
I have it.

491
00:33:16,025 --> 00:33:17,926
It's a secret.

492
00:33:17,961 --> 00:33:20,629
Mother doesn't like
the Onion Knight.

493
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,101
Ser Davos is a traitor.

494
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:30,373
He's rotting in a dungeon
cell for his crime.

495
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:41,584
Best forget him.

496
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:56,266
Not so hard.
You'll scrub the skin off.

497
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,734
What are you doing here?

498
00:33:57,768 --> 00:33:59,102
I need a bath.

499
00:33:59,136 --> 00:34:01,772
Help me out of these rags.

500
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,248
Now get out.

501
00:34:23,662 --> 00:34:25,296
There's another tub.

502
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:28,265
This one suits me fine.

503
00:34:40,978 --> 00:34:43,779
Don't worry.
I'm not interested.

504
00:34:45,915 --> 00:34:49,184
<i>If I faint, pull me out.</i>

505
00:34:49,218 --> 00:34:52,253
I don't intend to be the first
Lannister to die in a bathtub.

506
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:54,055
Why should I care how you die?

507
00:34:54,089 --> 00:34:57,058
You swore a solemn vow,
remember?

508
00:34:57,092 --> 00:35:00,761
You're supposed to get me to
King's Landing in one piece.

509
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:04,231
Not going so well, is it?

510
00:35:04,266 --> 00:35:06,900
No wonder Renly died
with you guarding him.

511
00:35:16,711 --> 00:35:19,046
That was unworthy.
Forgive me.

512
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,048
You protected me
better than most--

513
00:35:21,082 --> 00:35:23,818
- Don't you mock me.
- I'm apologizing.

514
00:35:25,621 --> 00:35:27,689
I'm sick of fighting.

515
00:35:27,723 --> 00:35:29,191
<i>Let's call a truce.</i>

516
00:35:29,225 --> 00:35:31,026
You need trust to have a truce.

517
00:35:32,428 --> 00:35:34,697
I trust you.

518
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:44,575
<i>There it is.</i>
<i>There's the look.</i>

519
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:47,078
I've seen it for 17 years

520
00:35:47,112 --> 00:35:48,746
on face after face.

521
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:52,016
<i>You all despise me.</i>

522
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,784
Kingslayer.

523
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:55,987
Oathbreaker.

524
00:35:56,021 --> 00:35:58,923
A man without honor.

525
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:06,096
You've heard of wildfire?

526
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:07,631
Of course.

527
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:10,434
<i>The Mad King</i>
<i>was obsessed with it.</i>

528
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:13,003
He loved to watch people burn,

529
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:15,572
the way their skin
blackened and blistered

530
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:18,208
<i>and melted off their bones.</i>

531
00:36:18,243 --> 00:36:20,411
<i>He burned lords he didn't like.</i>

532
00:36:20,445 --> 00:36:22,513
<i>He burned Hands</i>
<i>who disobeyed him.</i>

533
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:25,982
He burned anyone
who was against him.

534
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:30,686
Before long, half the
country was against him.

535
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:36,091
Aerys saw traitors everywhere.

536
00:36:37,561 --> 00:36:41,630
So he had his pyromancer
place caches of wildfire

537
00:36:41,664 --> 00:36:44,099
<i>all over the city--</i>

538
00:36:44,133 --> 00:36:46,401
beneath the Sept of Baelor

539
00:36:46,436 --> 00:36:48,203
and the slums of Flea Bottom.

540
00:36:48,271 --> 00:36:51,541
Under houses, stables, taverns.

541
00:36:51,575 --> 00:36:54,911
Even beneath
the Red Keep itself.

542
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,049
Finally,

543
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:02,319
the day of reckoning came.

544
00:37:02,354 --> 00:37:04,722
Robert Baratheon
marched on the capital

545
00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:06,824
after his victory
at the Trident.

546
00:37:06,859 --> 00:37:09,260
But my father arrived first

547
00:37:09,294 --> 00:37:12,029
with the whole Lannister
army at his back,

548
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:16,467
promising to defend the city
against the rebels.

549
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:20,370
I knew my father
better than that.

550
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:23,740
<i>He's never been one</i>
<i>to pick the losing side.</i>

551
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:26,343
<i>I told the Mad King as much.</i>

552
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:30,113
I urged him
to surrender peacefully.

553
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:33,349
<i>But the king didn't</i>
<i>listen to me.</i>

554
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:36,086
He didn't listen to Varys
who tried to warn him.

555
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:40,490
But he did listen
to Grand Maester Pycelle,

556
00:37:40,525 --> 00:37:43,193
that grey, sunken cunt.

557
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:47,498
"You can trust
the Lannisters," he said.

558
00:37:49,134 --> 00:37:51,402
"The Lannisters
have always been

559
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:53,671
true friends
of the crown."

560
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,542
So we opened the gates

561
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:00,811
and my father sacked the city.

562
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:04,248
<i>Once again, I came to the king,</i>

563
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:07,451
begging him to surrender.

564
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,557
He told me to...

565
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:16,126
bring him my father's head.

566
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:19,529
Then he...

567
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:22,532
turned to his pyromancer.

568
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:25,334
"Burn them all," he said.

569
00:38:26,403 --> 00:38:29,439
"Burn them in their homes.

570
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,608
Burn them
in their beds."

571
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:37,749
Tell me, if your precious Renly

572
00:38:37,783 --> 00:38:40,652
commanded you to kill
your own father

573
00:38:40,686 --> 00:38:43,722
and stand by while
thousands of men,

574
00:38:43,756 --> 00:38:45,991
women, and children
burned alive,

575
00:38:46,025 --> 00:38:48,727
would you have done it?

576
00:38:48,761 --> 00:38:50,562
Would you have
kept your oath then?

577
00:38:54,533 --> 00:38:58,136
First, I killed the pyromancer.

578
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:01,773
<i>And then when the king</i>
<i>turned to flee,</i>

579
00:39:01,807 --> 00:39:05,310
I drove my sword into his back.

580
00:39:06,546 --> 00:39:09,047
<i>"Burn them all,"</i>
<i>he kept saying.</i>

581
00:39:09,082 --> 00:39:11,049
"Burn them all."

582
00:39:11,084 --> 00:39:13,318
I don't think
he expected to die.

583
00:39:13,353 --> 00:39:16,288
He-- he meant to...

584
00:39:17,824 --> 00:39:20,325
burn with the rest of us

585
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:23,161
and rise again,

586
00:39:23,196 --> 00:39:25,063
reborn as a dragon

587
00:39:25,098 --> 00:39:26,998
to turn his enemies to ash.

588
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:34,339
I slit his throat to make sure
that didn't happen.

589
00:39:38,444 --> 00:39:42,213
That's where Ned Stark
found me.

590
00:39:42,247 --> 00:39:44,448
If this is true...

591
00:39:46,084 --> 00:39:47,952
why didn't you tell anyone?

592
00:39:49,955 --> 00:39:51,822
Why didn't you tell Lord Stark?

593
00:39:51,857 --> 00:39:53,357
Stark?

594
00:39:53,392 --> 00:39:55,860
You think

595
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:59,831
the honorable Ned Stark

596
00:39:59,865 --> 00:40:03,135
wanted to hear my side?

597
00:40:03,169 --> 00:40:05,870
He judged me guilty

598
00:40:05,905 --> 00:40:08,306
the moment he set eyes on me.

599
00:40:11,411 --> 00:40:15,247
By what right does the wolf

600
00:40:15,281 --> 00:40:17,282
judge the lion?

601
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:20,152
- By what right?
- Help! Help!

602
00:40:20,186 --> 00:40:21,820
The Kingslayer!

603
00:40:23,089 --> 00:40:25,157
Jaime.

604
00:40:25,191 --> 00:40:27,193
My name is Jaime.

605
00:40:30,398 --> 00:40:32,766
<i>Onion Knight.</i>

606
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,735
<i>Ser Onion Knight.</i>

607
00:40:36,004 --> 00:40:38,405
Princess? Gods, what
are you doing here?

608
00:40:38,439 --> 00:40:40,907
- Shh, you'll wake Bert.
- Bert?

609
00:40:40,942 --> 00:40:44,011
He's the fat one.
He's on guard duty tonight.

610
00:40:44,045 --> 00:40:45,946
He likes to drink wine
and sleep a lot.

611
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:48,548
Go back to your room. You're
not supposed to be here.

612
00:40:48,582 --> 00:40:50,717
- If your father knew--
- He said you were a traitor.

613
00:40:50,751 --> 00:40:52,986
Are you?

614
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:55,588
I am, child.

615
00:40:55,622 --> 00:40:57,557
I disobeyed my king,
your father,

616
00:40:57,591 --> 00:40:59,425
and now I'm paying the price.

617
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,961
I don't care.
You're my friend.

618
00:41:01,996 --> 00:41:03,930
You must get bored down here.

619
00:41:03,965 --> 00:41:05,899
I brought you
something to read.

620
00:41:05,933 --> 00:41:07,768
It's about Aegon
and his dragons.

621
00:41:07,802 --> 00:41:11,237
Aegon used to live here.
Did you know that?

622
00:41:11,272 --> 00:41:13,039
- And the Targaryens built this castle.
- Aye.

623
00:41:13,074 --> 00:41:15,375
- So they did.
- You can hide the book under your cloak.

624
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:17,778
It's a good one.
I'll bring you more.

625
00:41:17,812 --> 00:41:20,681
Thank you, my lady.
I'm sure it's a fine book,

626
00:41:20,715 --> 00:41:22,116
but it's wasted on me.

627
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:24,618
Take it.
I have more.

628
00:41:25,754 --> 00:41:28,355
My lady, I can't read
the words.

629
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:30,458
You can't?

630
00:41:30,492 --> 00:41:33,194
I'll teach you. I'll come when
Bert's on duty and teach you.

631
00:41:33,228 --> 00:41:35,062
- No. No. No.
- It's easy. It'll be fun.

632
00:41:35,097 --> 00:41:37,231
- Go. We can't.
- Why not?

633
00:41:37,266 --> 00:41:40,034
What will they do,
lock us in cells?

634
00:41:46,274 --> 00:41:48,009
I wouldn't know where to start.

635
00:41:48,043 --> 00:41:49,777
At the beginning.

636
00:41:49,811 --> 00:41:51,712
This word is Aegon.

637
00:41:51,747 --> 00:41:55,850
When you see A, E, and G
together like that,

638
00:41:55,884 --> 00:41:57,785
it sounds like egg.

639
00:41:57,819 --> 00:41:59,721
And the title of the whole book

640
00:41:59,755 --> 00:42:01,923
is "An History
of Aegon the Conqueror

641
00:42:01,957 --> 00:42:04,125
<i>and His Conquest</i>
<i>of Westeros."</i>

642
00:42:16,338 --> 00:42:17,972
It was a
bitch of a siege.

643
00:42:18,007 --> 00:42:20,175
Mm, you were first through
the breach at Pyke?

644
00:42:20,209 --> 00:42:23,678
The second. Thoros of
Myr went in alone,

645
00:42:23,712 --> 00:42:25,880
waving that
flaming sword of his.

646
00:42:25,915 --> 00:42:28,616
Thoros of Myr.
Bloody madman.

647
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:31,586
Robert knighted you
after the battle?

648
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:33,488
Proudest moment of my life.

649
00:42:33,522 --> 00:42:36,724
One knee in the dust, the
king's sword on my shoulder,

650
00:42:36,759 --> 00:42:38,059
listening to the words.

651
00:42:38,093 --> 00:42:41,796
"In the name of the Warrior,
I charge you to be brave."

652
00:42:41,831 --> 00:42:44,767
All I could think of
was how badly I had to piss.

653
00:42:46,069 --> 00:42:48,704
In full plate
metal for 16 hours.

654
00:42:48,739 --> 00:42:50,707
Never occurred to me
till the fighting was over.

655
00:42:50,741 --> 00:42:53,944
I was very nearly the first man
knighted to piss on the king's boots.

656
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:58,015
Robert would have laughed.

657
00:42:58,049 --> 00:43:00,651
He was a good man,
a great warrior.

658
00:43:02,487 --> 00:43:04,421
And a terrible king.

659
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:07,824
I burned away my years
fighting for terrible kings.

660
00:43:07,859 --> 00:43:09,393
- You swore an oath.
- Yes.

661
00:43:09,427 --> 00:43:11,295
And a man of honor
keeps his vows,

662
00:43:11,329 --> 00:43:14,731
even if he's serving
a drunk or a lunatic.

663
00:43:14,766 --> 00:43:17,334
Just once in my life
before it's over,

664
00:43:17,369 --> 00:43:20,404
I want to know what it's
like to serve with pride,

665
00:43:20,438 --> 00:43:23,574
to fight for someone
I believe in.

666
00:43:23,608 --> 00:43:25,375
Do you believe in her?

667
00:43:28,212 --> 00:43:30,047
With all my heart.

668
00:43:35,186 --> 00:43:36,318
These are the ones?

669
00:43:36,438 --> 00:43:38,609
Yes, khaleesi.
The officers.

670
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:42,822
_

671
00:43:43,317 --> 00:43:47,658
_

672
00:43:48,269 --> 00:43:52,136
_

673
00:43:56,581 --> 00:43:58,704
_

674
00:44:06,111 --> 00:44:07,942
_

675
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:09,773
_

676
00:44:09,893 --> 00:44:11,563
_

677
00:44:11,683 --> 00:44:13,269
_

678
00:44:14,492 --> 00:44:16,894
All Unsullied boys
are given new names

679
00:44:16,928 --> 00:44:18,528
when they are cut--

680
00:44:18,563 --> 00:44:21,431
Grey Worm, Red Flea, Black Rat.

681
00:44:21,466 --> 00:44:24,234
<i>Names that remind them</i>
<i>what they are--</i>

682
00:44:24,269 --> 00:44:26,770
vermin.

683
00:44:30,298 --> 00:44:32,795
_

684
00:44:32,915 --> 00:44:36,749
_

685
00:44:36,869 --> 00:44:38,788
_

686
00:44:39,246 --> 00:44:41,909
_

687
00:44:42,029 --> 00:44:46,528
_

688
00:44:47,569 --> 00:44:49,983
_

689
00:44:50,103 --> 00:44:51,697
_

690
00:44:52,129 --> 00:44:55,159
_

691
00:44:55,592 --> 00:45:00,120
_

692
00:45:00,774 --> 00:45:10,429
_

693
00:45:13,686 --> 00:45:15,402
<i>King Robert
wanted her dead.</i>

694
00:45:15,522 --> 00:45:16,794
Of course he wanted her dead.

695
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:20,459
She's a Targaryen.
The last Targaryen.

696
00:45:20,494 --> 00:45:23,150
I suppose no one on the small
council could speak sense to him.

697
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:26,165
- I didn't sit on the small council.
- No?

698
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,801
Doesn't the Lord Commander of
the Kingsguard traditionally--

699
00:45:28,836 --> 00:45:30,703
Traditionally, yes,
but I killed a dozen

700
00:45:30,737 --> 00:45:32,872
of Robert's friends
during his rebellion.

701
00:45:35,041 --> 00:45:36,708
He didn't want advice
on how to govern

702
00:45:36,743 --> 00:45:38,677
from a man who had fought
for the Mad King.

703
00:45:38,711 --> 00:45:40,612
Can't say I minded much.

704
00:45:40,732 --> 00:45:43,815
I always hated the politics.

705
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:45,784
Yeah, I imagine I would, too.

706
00:45:45,818 --> 00:45:48,253
Hours spent jabbering
about backstabbings

707
00:45:48,288 --> 00:45:51,456
- and betrayals the world over.
- Mm-hmm.

708
00:45:54,627 --> 00:45:56,528
Still, she'll have
to wade through that muck

709
00:45:56,562 --> 00:45:58,764
if she wants to rule
the Seven Kingdoms.

710
00:45:58,798 --> 00:46:00,866
She'll have good men
around her to advise her,

711
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:02,367
men with experience.

712
00:46:02,402 --> 00:46:03,902
Which men do you have in mind?

713
00:46:03,937 --> 00:46:05,938
Forgive me, Ser Jorah,
for what I'm about to say,

714
00:46:05,972 --> 00:46:09,542
but your reputation in Westeros
has suffered over the years.

715
00:46:09,576 --> 00:46:11,978
It suffered for a reason.

716
00:46:12,012 --> 00:46:13,779
I sold men into slavery.

717
00:46:13,814 --> 00:46:15,648
I don't know if your
presence by her side

718
00:46:15,682 --> 00:46:17,950
will help our cause
when we go home.

719
00:46:17,984 --> 00:46:19,785
Our cause?

720
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:21,854
Forgive me, Ser
Barristan, but I was busy

721
00:46:21,889 --> 00:46:24,090
defending the khaleesi against
King Robert's assassins

722
00:46:24,124 --> 00:46:25,925
while you were still
bowing to the man.

723
00:46:25,959 --> 00:46:28,961
We both want her to rule.
Am I wrong?

724
00:46:28,996 --> 00:46:31,597
You only joined us
a few days ago.

725
00:46:31,631 --> 00:46:33,765
I can't speak
to your intentions.

726
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,934
If we're truly
her loyal servants,

727
00:46:35,968 --> 00:46:38,770
we will do whatever
needs to be done,

728
00:46:38,804 --> 00:46:41,406
no matter the cost,
no matter our pride.

729
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,008
You're not Lord Commander here.

730
00:46:44,043 --> 00:46:46,611
You're just another exile.

731
00:46:46,645 --> 00:46:48,713
And I take my orders
from the queen.

732
00:46:56,888 --> 00:46:59,723
<i>- Come to bed.</i>
- You were right.

733
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:02,693
The Karstarks are gone.

734
00:47:03,661 --> 00:47:05,896
Almost half our forces.

735
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:09,433
Tywin Lannister knows what he
needs to do to make us unravel.

736
00:47:09,467 --> 00:47:12,336
Nothing.

737
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:14,505
Only wait.

738
00:47:14,539 --> 00:47:17,041
Don't let him.

739
00:47:17,075 --> 00:47:19,176
What can I do?

740
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:20,644
Attack King's Landing?

741
00:47:20,679 --> 00:47:22,813
There's nothing
he'd like better.

742
00:47:22,847 --> 00:47:24,848
He'd crush us in a day.

743
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:27,017
We could ride north.

744
00:47:27,051 --> 00:47:29,720
<i>Take your land back</i>
<i>from the Greyjoys.</i>

745
00:47:29,754 --> 00:47:33,023
- Wait out the winter.
- Winter could last five years.

746
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:34,424
Once my bannermen
are home again,

747
00:47:34,459 --> 00:47:37,228
sitting by the fire,
surrounded by their families,

748
00:47:37,262 --> 00:47:40,331
warm and safe, they'll
never ride south again.

749
00:47:40,365 --> 00:47:42,500
When I gathered
my lords together,

750
00:47:42,535 --> 00:47:44,436
we had a purpose, a mission.

751
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:47,238
Now we're like a band
of bickering children.

752
00:47:49,609 --> 00:47:51,510
Give them a new purpose.

753
00:47:51,544 --> 00:47:53,245
What?

754
00:47:54,747 --> 00:47:56,948
Oh, I don't know.

755
00:47:56,983 --> 00:47:59,484
I don't even know
where Winterfell is.

756
00:48:02,154 --> 00:48:04,089
Here.

757
00:48:07,327 --> 00:48:10,896
And we're here.
King's Landing--

758
00:48:17,771 --> 00:48:19,305
What is it?

759
00:48:22,542 --> 00:48:25,711
I can't force them
to meet us in the field

760
00:48:25,745 --> 00:48:28,146
and I can't attack them
where they're strongest,

761
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:31,083
but I can attack them
where they're not.

762
00:48:32,252 --> 00:48:35,120
And Casterly Rock
can't run away.

763
00:48:36,389 --> 00:48:39,425
I'm going to take
their home away from them.

764
00:48:40,694 --> 00:48:42,862
Can you do it?

765
00:48:42,896 --> 00:48:45,899
I need men to replace the
Karstarks who marched home.

766
00:48:45,933 --> 00:48:48,535
There is only one person
in this kingdom

767
00:48:48,569 --> 00:48:51,771
with that kind of army who hasn't
already sided with the Lannisters.

768
00:48:53,207 --> 00:48:55,908
The man whose daughter
I was supposed to marry--

769
00:48:56,944 --> 00:48:58,844
Walder Frey.

770
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,988
He's such a splendid fighter.

771
00:49:10,022 --> 00:49:13,358
Do you have any idea
when we might...

772
00:49:13,393 --> 00:49:17,029
I'll plant the seed as soon
as Joffrey and I are married.

773
00:49:17,063 --> 00:49:18,530
It should grow quickly.

774
00:49:18,564 --> 00:49:20,198
Joffrey won't let me leave.

775
00:49:20,233 --> 00:49:22,968
He's got too many reasons
to keep me here.

776
00:49:23,002 --> 00:49:26,338
And only one to let you go.

777
00:49:26,372 --> 00:49:28,573
Because it will please me.

778
00:49:28,608 --> 00:49:30,642
<i>Squire!</i>

779
00:49:34,214 --> 00:49:35,881
Well fought, ser.

780
00:49:35,915 --> 00:49:38,683
That was no fight.
I don't know you.

781
00:49:38,718 --> 00:49:41,052
Olyver, if it please you.

782
00:49:43,222 --> 00:49:46,090
I should like to see you spar
with a proper partner, ser.

783
00:49:54,133 --> 00:49:55,666
How did you know?

784
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:57,602
Know what?

785
00:49:58,937 --> 00:50:00,772
That I wanted to.

786
00:50:00,806 --> 00:50:02,673
My lord...

787
00:50:06,711 --> 00:50:08,379
I'll have you know
I'm to be married soon

788
00:50:08,413 --> 00:50:11,482
and even my intended
hasn't the slightest notion.

789
00:50:11,516 --> 00:50:14,619
They rarely do,
in my experience.

790
00:50:14,653 --> 00:50:17,021
You have a good deal
of experience, do you?

791
00:50:17,956 --> 00:50:20,124
With the husbands.

792
00:50:28,968 --> 00:50:31,303
That didn't take long.

793
00:50:31,338 --> 00:50:33,540
Well, it took long enough.

794
00:50:35,109 --> 00:50:38,078
It seems our Knight of Flowers
is engaged to be wed.

795
00:50:38,112 --> 00:50:39,913
Is he?

796
00:50:39,947 --> 00:50:42,248
And...

797
00:50:42,283 --> 00:50:44,084
who's the lucky girl?

798
00:50:44,118 --> 00:50:47,621
<i>She may not be
the grandest ship in the world</i>

799
00:50:47,655 --> 00:50:50,123
or the fastest,

800
00:50:50,158 --> 00:50:52,326
but she's mine.

801
00:50:55,864 --> 00:50:57,798
I've always wanted a ship.

802
00:50:57,832 --> 00:50:59,967
Now I want a dozen.

803
00:51:00,002 --> 00:51:02,637
- Strange, isn't it?
- What is?

804
00:51:02,671 --> 00:51:04,840
It doesn't matter what we want,

805
00:51:04,874 --> 00:51:06,675
once we get it,

806
00:51:06,709 --> 00:51:08,444
then we want something else.

807
00:51:11,214 --> 00:51:13,916
Your hair is different.

808
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:15,584
Is it?

809
00:51:15,618 --> 00:51:17,219
Lady Margaery
wears it that way.

810
00:51:17,253 --> 00:51:19,655
Many ladies wear it this way.

811
00:51:19,689 --> 00:51:21,424
I have good news.

812
00:51:21,458 --> 00:51:23,559
I'll be leaving the city soon.

813
00:51:23,593 --> 00:51:25,060
You still want me
to come with you?

814
00:51:25,095 --> 00:51:27,296
It's not a question
of what I want.

815
00:51:27,330 --> 00:51:29,532
It's what you want.

816
00:51:29,566 --> 00:51:30,766
You want to go home, don't you?

817
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,235
Of course.
More than anything.

818
00:51:35,405 --> 00:51:38,807
But maybe it would
be better to wait.

819
00:51:38,842 --> 00:51:41,644
I've been thinking
how dangerous it would be.

820
00:51:41,678 --> 00:51:44,546
Not just for me, but for you.

821
00:51:44,581 --> 00:51:45,847
You've been so kind.

822
00:51:45,882 --> 00:51:49,050
I'd feel terrible if
anything happened to you.

823
00:51:50,186 --> 00:51:52,420
I can't tell you
how touched I am

824
00:51:52,455 --> 00:51:55,690
by your concern for my welfare.

825
00:51:55,725 --> 00:51:58,527
I hope you know that
I'm your friend, Sansa.

826
00:51:58,594 --> 00:52:00,595
Your true friend.

827
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:02,330
I do, Lord Baelish.

828
00:52:02,365 --> 00:52:05,034
- Petyr.
- Petyr.

829
00:52:05,068 --> 00:52:07,169
If you wish to stay,

830
00:52:07,203 --> 00:52:10,205
then of course you will stay.

831
00:52:15,111 --> 00:52:17,479
We'll speak again
when I return.

832
00:52:30,492 --> 00:52:32,626
<i>You're late.</i>

833
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:35,462
What's she doing here?

834
00:52:35,497 --> 00:52:37,531
Our business concerns her, too.

835
00:52:37,565 --> 00:52:39,399
<i>Sit.</i>

836
00:52:41,403 --> 00:52:43,003
You'll be pleased to learn

837
00:52:43,038 --> 00:52:46,106
that after one conversation
with Olenna Tyrell,

838
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:48,174
I've saved the crown

839
00:52:48,209 --> 00:52:51,011
hundreds of thousands
on this wedding.

840
00:52:51,045 --> 00:52:52,079
Never mind that now.

841
00:52:52,113 --> 00:52:53,633
We have something
important to discuss.

842
00:52:53,648 --> 00:52:56,083
I'm Master of Coin.
Saving money is important.

843
00:52:56,985 --> 00:52:58,419
Stop that.

844
00:52:58,453 --> 00:53:00,387
You're making me uncomfortable.

845
00:53:00,422 --> 00:53:03,391
Your sister has learned that
your new friends the Tyrells

846
00:53:03,426 --> 00:53:06,429
are plotting to marry
Sansa Stark to Ser Loras.

847
00:53:06,463 --> 00:53:08,231
Very well.

848
00:53:08,265 --> 00:53:10,299
She's a lovely girl.

849
00:53:10,334 --> 00:53:12,334
Missing some of Loras'
favorite bits,

850
00:53:12,369 --> 00:53:14,170
but I'm sure they'll make do.

851
00:53:14,204 --> 00:53:16,739
- Your jokes are not appreciated.
- It wasn't my best, but--

852
00:53:16,773 --> 00:53:19,875
I bring them into the royal fold
and this is how they repay me,

853
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:23,379
by trying to steal the key to
the North out from under me.

854
00:53:23,413 --> 00:53:25,081
Sansa is the key to the North?

855
00:53:25,115 --> 00:53:27,483
I seem to remember
she has an older brother.

856
00:53:27,517 --> 00:53:29,518
The Karstarks
have marched home.

857
00:53:29,553 --> 00:53:32,488
The young wolf has lost half his army.
His days are numbered.

858
00:53:32,523 --> 00:53:35,625
<i>Theon Greyjoy murdered</i>
<i>both his brothers.</i>

859
00:53:35,659 --> 00:53:38,995
That makes Sansa Stark
the heir to Winterfell.

860
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:42,866
And I am not about to hand
her over to the Tyrells.

861
00:53:42,901 --> 00:53:45,202
<i>The Tyrell army is
helping us to win this war.</i>

862
00:53:45,237 --> 00:53:48,005
Do you really think
it's wise to refuse them?

863
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:49,840
There's nothing to refuse.
This is a plot.

864
00:53:49,875 --> 00:53:52,677
<i>Plots are not public knowledge.</i>

865
00:53:52,711 --> 00:53:54,445
And the Tyrells
won't carry this one out

866
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,647
until after Joffrey's wedding.

867
00:53:56,682 --> 00:54:00,451
We need to act first and
kill this union in its crib.

868
00:54:00,485 --> 00:54:01,886
And how do we do that?

869
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,187
We find Sansa Stark
a different husband.

870
00:54:04,222 --> 00:54:06,823
- Wonderful.
- Yes, it is.

871
00:54:14,399 --> 00:54:15,966
You can't mean it.

872
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,467
I can and I do.

873
00:54:17,502 --> 00:54:20,604
Joffrey has made this
poor girl's life miserable

874
00:54:20,638 --> 00:54:22,673
since the day he took
her father's head.

875
00:54:22,707 --> 00:54:25,742
Now she's finally free of
him and you give her to me?

876
00:54:25,776 --> 00:54:27,477
That's cruel even for you.

877
00:54:27,512 --> 00:54:29,379
Do you intend
on mistreating her?

878
00:54:29,414 --> 00:54:31,348
The girl's happiness
is not my concern,

879
00:54:31,383 --> 00:54:33,617
- nor should it be yours.
- She's a child!

880
00:54:33,652 --> 00:54:36,521
She's flowered, I assure you. She
and I have discussed it at length.

881
00:54:36,555 --> 00:54:40,058
There, you see? You will wed her,
bed her, and put a child in her.

882
00:54:40,092 --> 00:54:43,128
- <i>Surely you're capable of that.</i>
- And if I refuse?

883
00:54:43,163 --> 00:54:45,832
You wanted to be rewarded
for your valor in battle.

884
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:49,869
Sansa Stark is a finer reward than
you could ever dare hope for.

885
00:54:49,903 --> 00:54:52,405
And it is past time
you were wed.

886
00:54:52,439 --> 00:54:55,274
I was wed.

887
00:54:55,309 --> 00:54:57,877
Or don't you remember?

888
00:54:59,313 --> 00:55:01,447
Only too well.

889
00:55:01,482 --> 00:55:04,851
<i>You should be
thanking the gods for this.</i>

890
00:55:04,885 --> 00:55:06,519
This is more than you deserve.

891
00:55:06,554 --> 00:55:09,022
<i>Tyrion will do as he's bid.</i>

892
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:11,124
As will you.

893
00:55:12,526 --> 00:55:14,627
What do you mean?

894
00:55:14,662 --> 00:55:16,529
You'll marry Ser Loras.

895
00:55:18,699 --> 00:55:21,134
- I will not.
- The boy is heir to Highgarden.

896
00:55:21,168 --> 00:55:23,637
Tyrion will secure the North,
you will secure the Reach.

897
00:55:23,671 --> 00:55:26,407
- No, I won't do it.
- Yes, you will.

898
00:55:26,441 --> 00:55:29,143
You're still fertile. You need
to marry again and breed.

899
00:55:29,177 --> 00:55:31,345
I am Queen Regent,
not some broodmare.

900
00:55:31,379 --> 00:55:34,048
You're my daughter!

901
00:55:34,082 --> 00:55:35,717
You will do as I command

902
00:55:35,751 --> 00:55:37,986
and you will marry Loras Tyrell

903
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:40,355
and put an end
to the disgusting rumors

904
00:55:40,389 --> 00:55:43,191
about you once and for all.

905
00:55:43,226 --> 00:55:45,327
Father, don't make me
do it again, please.

906
00:55:45,361 --> 00:55:47,897
Not another word.

907
00:55:47,931 --> 00:55:50,999
My children.

908
00:55:51,034 --> 00:55:54,937
You've disgraced the Lannister
name for far too long.
