00:01:42,543 --> 00:01:47,875
3x06
The Climb

3
00:02:05,182 --> 00:02:07,917
You've got too much
wood in there.

4
00:02:07,952 --> 00:02:11,587
But the more wood,
the bigger the fire.

5
00:02:11,621 --> 00:02:13,723
It needs to breathe.

6
00:02:13,757 --> 00:02:15,692
<i>Take off that big log.</i>

7
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:28,573
Huh.
You know your fires.

8
00:02:36,382 --> 00:02:40,085
Someone built your fires
for you growing up?

9
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:42,988
It doesn't get so cold
down in the Reach.

10
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:46,858
And there were
servants, of course.

11
00:02:46,893 --> 00:02:49,161
I knew you were highborn.

12
00:02:52,698 --> 00:02:56,568
Oh, I found something
at the Fist of the First Men.

13
00:02:58,951 --> 00:03:00,785
Buried treasure.

14
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,322
Thousands of years old.

15
00:03:03,356 --> 00:03:04,956
I think.

16
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:08,060
What does it do?

17
00:03:09,295 --> 00:03:11,796
I'm not sure
that it does anything.

18
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:14,032
It's beautiful, though,
isn't it?

19
00:03:22,108 --> 00:03:25,310
- How much longer?
- Not so far.

20
00:03:25,344 --> 00:03:27,512
A few more days.

21
00:03:27,546 --> 00:03:30,883
Is the Wall as big as they say?

22
00:03:30,917 --> 00:03:32,785
Bigger.

23
00:03:34,054 --> 00:03:37,023
So big you can't even see
the top sometimes.

24
00:03:37,057 --> 00:03:39,059
It's hidden in clouds.

25
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,429
You're playing with me.

26
00:03:42,463 --> 00:03:46,634
I'm not.
It's 700 feet high,

27
00:03:46,668 --> 00:03:48,970
all made of ice.

28
00:03:49,038 --> 00:03:51,673
On a warm day
you can see it weeping.

29
00:03:56,279 --> 00:03:59,581
Castle Black is nice enough.

30
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:02,951
They keep a fire burning
in the long hall

31
00:04:02,985 --> 00:04:04,720
day and night.

32
00:04:04,754 --> 00:04:08,891
And Hobb makes venison stew

33
00:04:08,925 --> 00:04:10,692
with onions.

34
00:04:10,727 --> 00:04:12,127
Very tasty.

35
00:04:12,162 --> 00:04:16,465
Sometimes, one of
the brothers will sing.

36
00:04:16,499 --> 00:04:19,034
Dareon sings best.

37
00:04:19,068 --> 00:04:21,169
- Do you sing?
- No.

38
00:04:21,203 --> 00:04:24,005
No, no, no.
Not very well.

39
00:04:26,242 --> 00:04:28,577
Sing me a song.

40
00:04:28,611 --> 00:04:32,214
Oh, all right.

41
00:04:32,249 --> 00:04:34,150
Let's see.

42
00:04:35,986 --> 00:04:38,920
Oh... ahem.

43
00:04:42,024 --> 00:04:45,126
♪ The father's face
is stern and strong ♪

44
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:48,263

51
00:05:17,293 --> 00:05:18,860
That's not how
you skin a rabbit.

52
00:05:18,894 --> 00:05:20,362
I know how to skin a rabbit.

53
00:05:20,396 --> 00:05:22,731
Not by the looks of it.

54
00:05:38,347 --> 00:05:40,848
You grow up north of the Wall,

55
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:42,717
you learn the proper
way to handle game.

56
00:05:42,751 --> 00:05:45,186
I didn't see any game
before I got here.

57
00:05:46,655 --> 00:05:48,790
If I had a bow, I could
have shot a dozen rabbits.

58
00:05:48,824 --> 00:05:50,358
Well, I made this bow myself.

59
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:52,512
Guess you don't learn how to
do that north of the Wall.

60
00:05:52,527 --> 00:05:54,661
You learn how to use
your fists, though.

61
00:05:54,696 --> 00:05:56,730
Oh, you're gonna punch
the rabbits to death?

62
00:05:56,765 --> 00:05:58,232
I had someone else in mind.

63
00:05:58,266 --> 00:05:59,733
Well, someone else
is sitting right here.

64
00:05:59,768 --> 00:06:02,236
You're both very good
at skinning rabbits.

65
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:05,105
Some of us are just
a little better.

66
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:07,107
Well, some of us would say
thank you when someone else

67
00:06:07,141 --> 00:06:09,209
hunts down their
breakfast for them.

68
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,178
Or don't they teach you to say
thank you north of the Wall?

69
00:06:11,212 --> 00:06:14,848
You've got a big mouth,
girl, and too many teeth.

70
00:06:14,882 --> 00:06:17,050
- Stop it!
- Hodor.

71
00:06:17,084 --> 00:06:19,586
You've been fighting since you met.
Just stop it.

72
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,422
Lady Reed here's got
a stick so far up her ass,

73
00:06:22,456 --> 00:06:23,923
it's a wonder her feet
touch the ground.

74
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,293
You've been nasty
to her every day.

75
00:06:26,327 --> 00:06:27,727
Of course she's nasty back.

76
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,362
Me? It's my fault?

77
00:06:29,396 --> 00:06:31,564
First time I met her, she
put a knife to my throat.

78
00:06:31,598 --> 00:06:33,933
First time I met you,
you held a knife at me.

79
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,804
We can't fight each other.

80
00:06:37,838 --> 00:06:40,107
We'll never make it
to the Wall.

81
00:06:41,142 --> 00:06:42,876
I want you both to make peace.

82
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:54,055
Your way of skinning rabbits
is quicker than mine.

83
00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:56,691
- I said so, didn't I?
- Osha!

84
00:07:00,195 --> 00:07:01,862
You're a good little hunter.

85
00:07:01,896 --> 00:07:03,330
Thank you.

86
00:07:03,365 --> 00:07:04,798
See?

87
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,566
Not so hard, is it?
Thank you.

88
00:07:06,601 --> 00:07:08,001
Don't push me.

89
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:20,413
Shh.

90
00:07:20,447 --> 00:07:22,482
I'm right here with you.

91
00:07:22,516 --> 00:07:24,450
What's happening?

92
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,653
I'm right here with you.

93
00:07:28,422 --> 00:07:29,555
What's wrong with him?

94
00:07:32,993 --> 00:07:35,761
The visions take their toll.

95
00:07:37,364 --> 00:07:39,098
He's having one now?

96
00:07:59,252 --> 00:08:01,286
I saw Jon Snow.

97
00:08:02,254 --> 00:08:04,289
You saw him?

98
00:08:04,323 --> 00:08:05,890
At Castle Black?

99
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,593
He was on the wrong side
of the Wall...

100
00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:12,229
surrounded by enemies.

101
00:08:21,673 --> 00:08:25,409
Used to be you couldn't find a
tree within a mile of the Wall.

102
00:08:25,443 --> 00:08:28,579
Crows would come out
every morning with axes.

103
00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:35,318
Your flock gets smaller
every year.

104
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,427
You ever climbed it before?

105
00:08:43,461 --> 00:08:45,530
No.

106
00:08:45,564 --> 00:08:48,500
But Tormund's done it
half a hundred times.

107
00:08:54,307 --> 00:08:56,309
You're afraid.

108
00:08:58,112 --> 00:09:00,546
- Aren't you?
- <i>Aye.</i>

109
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:03,316
It's a long way up
and a long way down.

110
00:09:03,351 --> 00:09:05,719
But I've waited my whole life

111
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,754
to see the world from up there.

112
00:09:12,193 --> 00:09:15,262
Here, sit down.
I brought a pair for you.

113
00:09:16,631 --> 00:09:19,566
They're too big for you,
but they're good.

114
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,435
You kill someone for them?

115
00:09:21,469 --> 00:09:23,637
Nah.

116
00:09:23,671 --> 00:09:25,439
<i>I didn't kill him,</i>

117
00:09:25,473 --> 00:09:27,841
but I bet his balls
are still bruised.

118
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:37,485
He wasn't good to me
the way you're good to me.

119
00:09:38,854 --> 00:09:42,123
He didn't do that thing
you do with your tongue.

120
00:09:43,258 --> 00:09:44,926
Can we not talk
about that here?

121
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,429
"Can we not
talk about that here?

122
00:09:47,463 --> 00:09:49,264
I'm Jon Snow.

123
00:09:49,299 --> 00:09:51,300
I've killed dead men
and Qhorin Halfhand,

124
00:09:51,334 --> 00:09:53,436
but I'm scared
of naked girls."

125
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:54,971
Did I seem scared
the other day?

126
00:09:55,005 --> 00:09:56,639
You were trembling like a leaf.

127
00:09:56,673 --> 00:09:58,207
Only in the beginning.

128
00:09:59,743 --> 00:10:01,611
Only in the beginning.

129
00:10:04,182 --> 00:10:06,750
You're a proper lover,
Jon Snow.

130
00:10:06,784 --> 00:10:09,653
And don't worry.

131
00:10:09,687 --> 00:10:11,755
Your secret's safe with me.

132
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:14,224
What secret?

133
00:10:15,926 --> 00:10:17,727
Do you think I'm as dumb
as all those girls

134
00:10:17,762 --> 00:10:21,697
in silk dresses
you knew growing up?

135
00:10:21,732 --> 00:10:24,667
You're loyal and you're brave.

136
00:10:28,772 --> 00:10:30,539
You didn't stop being a crow

137
00:10:30,574 --> 00:10:33,275
the day you walked
into Mance Rayder's tent.

138
00:10:39,883 --> 00:10:42,318
But I'm your woman now,
Jon Snow.

139
00:10:44,421 --> 00:10:47,824
You're going to be loyal
to your woman.

140
00:10:52,663 --> 00:10:55,499
The Night's Watch don't
care if you live or die.

141
00:10:55,533 --> 00:10:58,902
Mance Rayder don't care
if I live or die.

142
00:10:58,936 --> 00:11:00,504
We're just soldiers
in their armies

143
00:11:00,538 --> 00:11:02,840
and there's plenty more
to carry on if we go down.

144
00:11:10,482 --> 00:11:13,051
It's you and me

145
00:11:13,085 --> 00:11:16,154
that matters to me and you.

146
00:11:19,792 --> 00:11:22,126
Don't ever betray me.

147
00:11:29,535 --> 00:11:30,935
I won't.

148
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:34,038
'Cause I'll cut
your pretty cock right off

149
00:11:34,073 --> 00:11:36,374
and wear it 'round my neck.

150
00:11:48,118 --> 00:11:49,952
Sink your metal deep

151
00:11:49,987 --> 00:11:53,522
and make sure it holds
before taking your next step.

152
00:11:54,424 --> 00:11:56,058
And if you fall,

153
00:11:56,093 --> 00:11:57,827
don't scream.

154
00:11:57,861 --> 00:12:01,498
You don't want that to be the
last thing she remembers.

155
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,780
<i>Joffrey.</i>

156
00:12:19,484 --> 00:12:21,786
Cersei.

157
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,688
<i>Ilyn Payne.</i>

158
00:12:24,957 --> 00:12:26,824
You're good.

159
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:34,165
You're not as good
as you think you are.

160
00:12:35,868 --> 00:12:38,502
Face, tits, balls--

161
00:12:38,537 --> 00:12:40,104
I hit 'em right
where I wanted to.

162
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:43,874
Aye, but you took
your sweet time of it.

163
00:12:43,908 --> 00:12:47,411
You won't be fighting
straw men, little lady.

164
00:12:49,347 --> 00:12:51,681
Show me your position.

165
00:12:54,451 --> 00:12:56,252
Keep your elbow high.

166
00:12:56,286 --> 00:12:59,255
You want your back
doing the hard labor.

167
00:13:01,224 --> 00:13:03,191
You're holding.

168
00:13:03,226 --> 00:13:04,960
Never hold.

169
00:13:04,994 --> 00:13:07,929
- What?
- Your muscles tense up when you hold.

170
00:13:07,963 --> 00:13:10,231
Pull the string back
to the center of your chin

171
00:13:10,265 --> 00:13:11,732
and release.

172
00:13:11,766 --> 00:13:13,667
Never hold.

173
00:13:13,702 --> 00:13:15,736
But I have to aim.

174
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:17,438
Never aim.

175
00:13:17,472 --> 00:13:19,039
Never aim?

176
00:13:19,074 --> 00:13:22,810
Your eye knows where
it wants the arrow to go.

177
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:25,045
Trust your eye.

178
00:13:29,117 --> 00:13:31,251
There's someone out there.

179
00:13:49,236 --> 00:13:52,305
That's about far enough.

180
00:13:57,077 --> 00:13:58,444
We come as friends.

181
00:13:58,478 --> 00:14:00,279
<i>Begging your pardon, m'lady,</i>

182
00:14:00,313 --> 00:14:02,414
but we'll be the judge of that.

183
00:14:04,717 --> 00:14:06,384
Valar morghulis.

184
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:08,453
<i>Valar dohaeris.</i>

185
00:14:09,688 --> 00:14:12,940
_

186
00:14:14,009 --> 00:14:16,051
_

187
00:14:17,544 --> 00:14:21,231
_

188
00:14:21,351 --> 00:14:24,845
_

189
00:14:25,641 --> 00:14:27,008
_

190
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:28,549
_

191
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,044
_

192
00:14:31,739 --> 00:14:34,560
_

193
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:40,137
_

194
00:14:41,019 --> 00:14:43,460
_

195
00:14:44,323 --> 00:14:47,259
My friends here
don't speak High Valyrian.

196
00:14:48,895 --> 00:14:51,029
<i>Why are you here, my lady?</i>

197
00:15:03,643 --> 00:15:05,744
Forgive my manners.

198
00:15:06,846 --> 00:15:08,780
I don't see many ladies
these days.

199
00:15:08,815 --> 00:15:10,682
Lucky for the ladies.

200
00:15:40,145 --> 00:15:42,246
How many times has
the Lord brought him back?

201
00:15:42,281 --> 00:15:44,115
Six.

202
00:15:46,452 --> 00:15:48,720
_

203
00:15:49,419 --> 00:15:51,961
_

204
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,013
_

205
00:15:55,133 --> 00:15:57,075
_

206
00:15:57,979 --> 00:16:00,535
_

207
00:16:00,951 --> 00:16:02,840
_

208
00:16:09,609 --> 00:16:12,011
I've always been
a terrible priest.

209
00:16:13,313 --> 00:16:15,915
Drank too much rum.

210
00:16:15,949 --> 00:16:18,050
Fucked all the whores
in King's Landing.

211
00:16:18,084 --> 00:16:20,786
It's a terrible thing to say,

212
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:24,722
but by the time I came to Westeros,
I didn't believe in our Lord.

213
00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:30,227
I decided that He,
that all the gods,

214
00:16:30,262 --> 00:16:33,798
<i>were stories we told the
children to make them behave.</i>

215
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,570
So I wore the robes and every now
and then I'd recite the prayers,

216
00:16:38,604 --> 00:16:41,673
but it was just for show.

217
00:16:43,443 --> 00:16:46,412
A spectacle for the locals.

218
00:16:46,446 --> 00:16:49,882
Until the Mountain drove a lance
through this one's heart.

219
00:16:54,121 --> 00:16:57,424
I knelt beside his cold body

220
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,259
and said the old words.

221
00:16:59,293 --> 00:17:01,995
Not because I believed
in them, but...

222
00:17:04,365 --> 00:17:07,268
he was my friend

223
00:17:07,302 --> 00:17:09,604
and he was dead.

224
00:17:10,806 --> 00:17:12,741
And they were
the only words I knew.

225
00:17:14,276 --> 00:17:17,278
And for the first time
in my life, the Lord replied.

226
00:17:19,514 --> 00:17:21,615
Beric's eyes opened

227
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:24,384
<i>and I knew the truth.</i>

228
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:27,421
Our god is the one true god.

229
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:32,158
And all men must serve Him.

230
00:17:39,233 --> 00:17:42,236
You've been to the other side.

231
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:45,239
The other side?

232
00:17:46,341 --> 00:17:49,143
There is no other side.

233
00:17:50,245 --> 00:17:52,846
I have been
to the darkness, my lady.

234
00:17:56,818 --> 00:17:59,654
He sent you to us for a reason.

235
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:03,458
You have someone He needs.

236
00:18:04,894 --> 00:18:07,329
Bodkin point.

237
00:18:07,363 --> 00:18:10,266
Penetrates plate at 200 yards.

238
00:18:14,104 --> 00:18:16,139
Can you make 'em?

239
00:18:16,173 --> 00:18:18,541
Yeah, nothing tricky about it.

240
00:18:18,576 --> 00:18:20,877
Just need decent steel.

241
00:18:20,911 --> 00:18:22,211
I'll get you the steel.

242
00:18:22,246 --> 00:18:24,481
<i>Come on.</i>

243
00:18:26,017 --> 00:18:27,751
<i>I don't like that woman.</i>

244
00:18:30,055 --> 00:18:32,623
That's 'cause you're a girl.

245
00:18:32,657 --> 00:18:34,391
What does that have
to do with anything?

246
00:18:40,665 --> 00:18:42,265
Forgive me, lad.

247
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:49,138
What are you doing?
Let go of him.

248
00:18:49,173 --> 00:18:50,807
- Tell them to stop.
- Come on.

249
00:18:50,841 --> 00:18:52,641
He wants to be one of you.

250
00:18:52,676 --> 00:18:54,943
He wants to join the Brotherhood.
Stop them!

251
00:18:54,978 --> 00:18:57,145
We serve the Lord of Light

252
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,381
and the Lord of Light
needs this boy.

253
00:18:59,415 --> 00:19:02,017
Did the Lord of Light
tell you that or did she?

254
00:19:08,024 --> 00:19:11,126
You're not doing this
for your god.

255
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,828
You're doing it for gold.

256
00:19:12,862 --> 00:19:15,030
We're doing it for both, girl.

257
00:19:16,399 --> 00:19:18,234
We can't defend the people
without weapons

258
00:19:18,268 --> 00:19:20,536
and horses and food.

259
00:19:20,571 --> 00:19:24,241
And we can't get weapons and
horses and food without gold.

260
00:19:24,275 --> 00:19:27,210
You told me
this was a Brotherhood.

261
00:19:27,244 --> 00:19:29,713
You told me
I could be one of you.

262
00:19:36,188 --> 00:19:38,356
You are more
than they can ever be.

263
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:41,258
They're just foot soldiers
in the great war.

264
00:19:41,293 --> 00:19:43,928
You will make kings
rise and fall.

265
00:19:55,707 --> 00:19:58,876
You're a witch.
You're going to hurt him.

266
00:20:03,949 --> 00:20:06,150
I see a darkness in you.

267
00:20:07,786 --> 00:20:10,621
And in that darkness,
eyes staring back at me--

268
00:20:10,656 --> 00:20:12,657
brown eyes,

269
00:20:12,691 --> 00:20:15,961
blue eyes, green eyes.

270
00:20:15,995 --> 00:20:19,164
Eyes you'll shut forever.

271
00:20:22,603 --> 00:20:24,704
We will meet again.

272
00:21:39,983 --> 00:21:42,651
You staring at my ass,
Jon Snow?

273
00:21:52,762 --> 00:21:54,429
You all right?

274
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,401
Just seeing if you can
take a hit, lad.

275
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:17,118
Sorry.
Were you sleeping?

276
00:22:17,152 --> 00:22:19,220
Wa--

277
00:22:20,856 --> 00:22:24,292
Wa--? Wa--?

278
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:27,229
Water?

279
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:29,298
You want some water.

280
00:22:31,835 --> 00:22:34,370
I wish I had some for you.

281
00:22:48,353 --> 00:22:50,754
So let's play a game.

282
00:22:51,923 --> 00:22:55,159
Which body part
do you need the least?

283
00:22:56,762 --> 00:23:00,231
- Please.
- Please is not a body part.

284
00:23:00,266 --> 00:23:02,567
I'll tell you everything,
please.

285
00:23:02,601 --> 00:23:07,138
But you've already
told me everything.

286
00:23:07,173 --> 00:23:09,674
<i>Remember?</i>

287
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:12,144
Your daddy was mean to you.

288
00:23:12,178 --> 00:23:15,514
The Starks didn't
appreciate you.

289
00:23:16,582 --> 00:23:19,151
One good bit, though.

290
00:23:19,185 --> 00:23:21,386
The Stark boys,

291
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:24,122
they're still alive.

292
00:23:25,257 --> 00:23:29,259
Wouldn't that be
a hunt to remember?

293
00:23:29,293 --> 00:23:33,230
You failed, but I'm a
better hunter than you.

294
00:23:34,966 --> 00:23:36,967
<i>Now...</i>

295
00:23:37,001 --> 00:23:38,969
how about your little finger?

296
00:23:39,004 --> 00:23:40,838
You don't use that
for much, do you?

297
00:23:40,872 --> 00:23:44,041
No? Good.
Let's start with that.

298
00:23:54,086 --> 00:23:56,754
You've been wondering
why you're here.

299
00:23:56,788 --> 00:23:59,290
<i>Haven't you?</i>

300
00:23:59,324 --> 00:24:01,158
<i>Where you are.</i>

301
00:24:01,193 --> 00:24:02,960
Who I am.

302
00:24:02,995 --> 00:24:05,796
Why I'm doing this to you.

303
00:24:07,399 --> 00:24:09,634
So guess.

304
00:24:09,668 --> 00:24:11,903
<i>If you guess right,</i>

305
00:24:11,937 --> 00:24:13,504
I'll tell you.

306
00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:16,507
By the old gods
and the new, I swear it.

307
00:24:18,443 --> 00:24:19,944
You win the game

308
00:24:19,978 --> 00:24:22,046
if you can figure out who I am

309
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,614
and why I'm torturing you

310
00:24:23,649 --> 00:24:26,984
and I win the game if you beg
me to cut off your finger.

311
00:24:28,887 --> 00:24:32,657
If I win, you'll let me go?

312
00:24:34,693 --> 00:24:37,461
If you think this has
a happy ending,

313
00:24:37,495 --> 00:24:40,497
you haven't been
paying attention.

314
00:24:40,531 --> 00:24:42,165
Please.

315
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,136
You say please again
and you'll wish you hadn't.

316
00:24:49,573 --> 00:24:51,741
You first.

317
00:24:51,775 --> 00:24:53,876
Where are we?

318
00:24:54,878 --> 00:24:57,480
- The North.
- Too vague.

319
00:24:57,514 --> 00:24:59,148
Deepwood Motte.

320
00:25:01,385 --> 00:25:03,619
Terrible guess.

321
00:25:11,295 --> 00:25:13,830
Now, where?

322
00:25:14,766 --> 00:25:16,834
Last Hearth.

323
00:25:16,868 --> 00:25:19,937
Do I look like
a fucking Umber to you?

324
00:25:23,041 --> 00:25:25,142
Karhold!

325
00:25:31,949 --> 00:25:33,683
Karhold?

326
00:25:36,487 --> 00:25:38,421
How did you know that?

327
00:25:39,824 --> 00:25:42,860
Did you see any banners
flying when we came in?

328
00:25:42,894 --> 00:25:44,494
No.

329
00:25:44,529 --> 00:25:47,097
It was just a guess.

330
00:25:47,132 --> 00:25:50,635
Very good, Lord Theon.

331
00:25:53,172 --> 00:25:54,572
And who am I?

332
00:25:55,808 --> 00:25:57,775
Torrhen Karstark.

333
00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:59,711
He's dead.

334
00:25:59,745 --> 00:26:02,347
Strangled by the Kingslayer.

335
00:26:04,149 --> 00:26:06,684
He was your brother.

336
00:26:11,022 --> 00:26:15,459
Your father
is Lord Rickard Karstark.

337
00:26:24,001 --> 00:26:27,236
- You swore to tell me if I--
- You're right.

338
00:26:29,072 --> 00:26:32,908
Lord Rickard Karstark
is Robb Stark's bannerman.

339
00:26:32,942 --> 00:26:34,876
<i>I betrayed Robb.</i>

340
00:26:34,911 --> 00:26:38,513
That's why you're torturing me.

341
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:42,484
Yes.

342
00:26:45,955 --> 00:26:47,656
You win.

343
00:26:58,034 --> 00:27:01,703
Of course, you forgot
to ask one question.

344
00:27:01,737 --> 00:27:05,240
You forgot to ask
if I'm a liar.

345
00:27:11,014 --> 00:27:13,649
I'm afraid I am.

346
00:27:15,618 --> 00:27:18,854
Everything I told you is a lie.

347
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:24,361
This isn't happening
to you for a reason.

348
00:27:24,395 --> 00:27:28,131
Well, one reason--
I enjoy it.

349
00:27:28,166 --> 00:27:31,402
Please, cut it off!
Cut it off! Cut it off!

350
00:27:37,542 --> 00:27:39,143
I win.

351
00:27:39,177 --> 00:27:41,846
Thank you for
riding here so quickly.

352
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,381
I know travel
isn't easy in these times.

353
00:27:44,416 --> 00:27:47,151
The roads are crawling with
cutthroats and bandits.

354
00:27:47,185 --> 00:27:50,655
But when the King of the
North summons us, we come.

355
00:27:50,689 --> 00:27:53,090
<i>Our father has
instructed us to tell you</i>

356
00:27:53,125 --> 00:27:55,860
that his alliance
with the North can continue

357
00:27:55,894 --> 00:27:58,563
if his terms are met.

358
00:27:58,597 --> 00:28:01,532
Lord Frey requires
a formal apology

359
00:28:01,567 --> 00:28:03,568
for your violation
of your sacred oath

360
00:28:03,602 --> 00:28:04,936
to marry one of his daughters.

361
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:08,072
Of course. He deserves as much.
I was in the wrong.

362
00:28:08,107 --> 00:28:10,541
As restitution
for this betrayal,

363
00:28:10,576 --> 00:28:13,678
<i>he demands Harrenhal</i>
<i>and all its attendant lands.</i>

364
00:28:13,712 --> 00:28:17,047
- I don't think that's--
- We are fighting for the North.

365
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:20,050
Harrenhal is not in the North.

366
00:28:20,084 --> 00:28:23,754
It is his once the war is over

367
00:28:23,788 --> 00:28:26,423
and we have no further
strategic need for it.

368
00:28:27,358 --> 00:28:30,259
And there's something else.

369
00:28:30,294 --> 00:28:33,095
We will do whatever we can to
give Lord Frey what he needs.

370
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:36,699
Not what, whom.

371
00:28:38,269 --> 00:28:40,103
What?

372
00:28:44,008 --> 00:28:47,077
No.

373
00:28:47,111 --> 00:28:49,346
Our father requires
Lord Edmure to wed

374
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,315
one of his daughters--
Roslin.

375
00:28:51,349 --> 00:28:53,184
How old is she?

376
00:28:53,218 --> 00:28:54,452
19.

377
00:28:54,486 --> 00:28:56,053
Could I see her first?

378
00:28:56,087 --> 00:28:57,221
You want to count her teeth?

379
00:28:57,255 --> 00:28:59,990
<i>We depart for the Twins</i>
<i>in the morning.</i>

380
00:29:00,025 --> 00:29:02,059
<i>We need an answer</i>
<i>before we leave</i>

381
00:29:02,093 --> 00:29:03,793
and a wedding not more
than a fortnight thereafter

382
00:29:03,828 --> 00:29:05,862
or this alliance is at an end.

383
00:29:05,896 --> 00:29:08,465
Your father does realize
we're in the middle of a war?

384
00:29:08,499 --> 00:29:11,167
Father is old.

385
00:29:11,201 --> 00:29:13,202
It will put his heart at peace

386
00:29:13,236 --> 00:29:16,104
if he could see her wed
to a good husband.

387
00:29:16,139 --> 00:29:18,974
And his recent experience
has made him wary

388
00:29:19,042 --> 00:29:20,910
<i>of long engagements.</i>

389
00:29:20,944 --> 00:29:22,745
He has every right to be.

390
00:29:22,779 --> 00:29:26,081
Please excuse us
while we discuss it.

391
00:29:42,633 --> 00:29:46,202
Why should I let that old
ferret choose my bride for me?

392
00:29:46,237 --> 00:29:49,306
At the very least, I should be
offered the same choice you were.

393
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,774
I'm his liege lord.

394
00:29:50,808 --> 00:29:53,009
He's a proud man
and we've wounded him.

395
00:29:53,044 --> 00:29:55,011
I didn't wound him.

396
00:29:55,046 --> 00:29:56,680
My answer is no.

397
00:30:00,952 --> 00:30:02,652
Listen to me

398
00:30:02,687 --> 00:30:05,656
and listen very carefully. You--

399
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:08,392
The laws of gods and men
are very clear.

400
00:30:08,426 --> 00:30:10,894
No man can compel
another man to marry.

401
00:30:10,929 --> 00:30:13,497
The laws of my fist are
about to compel your teeth.

402
00:30:13,531 --> 00:30:16,733
It's all right.
You heard him.

403
00:30:16,801 --> 00:30:19,970
If you refuse, our alliance
with the Freys is dead.

404
00:30:20,004 --> 00:30:23,406
He's wanted me for one of his
daughters since I was 12.

405
00:30:23,441 --> 00:30:26,209
He's not gonna stop
wanting it now.

406
00:30:26,244 --> 00:30:28,612
When I say no,
he will come back

407
00:30:28,646 --> 00:30:30,647
and offer me a daughter
of my choosing.

408
00:30:30,682 --> 00:30:32,516
You're willing to risk
our freedom

409
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:34,985
and our lives for a chance
at a prettier wife?

410
00:30:35,019 --> 00:30:37,354
I have a war to fight.

411
00:30:37,388 --> 00:30:39,389
We can't win it without them.

412
00:30:39,424 --> 00:30:41,258
I have no time to haggle.

413
00:30:41,292 --> 00:30:43,427
You said you wanted to make
amends for the Stone Mill.

414
00:30:43,461 --> 00:30:47,365
You recall that
heroic engagement?

415
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:54,306
I had something
less permanent in mind.

416
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,775
I've won every battle,

417
00:30:56,809 --> 00:30:58,644
but I'm losing this war.

418
00:31:00,447 --> 00:31:03,649
If we don't do this
and do it now,

419
00:31:03,683 --> 00:31:05,751
we're lost.

420
00:31:11,157 --> 00:31:13,025
I'll marry her.

421
00:31:13,059 --> 00:31:15,961
You're paying
for my sins, Uncle.

422
00:31:15,995 --> 00:31:18,831
It's not fair or right.

423
00:31:18,865 --> 00:31:20,666
I'll remember it.

424
00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:28,307
<i>I see my men
have finally found you</i>

425
00:31:28,341 --> 00:31:30,409
<i>something appropriate to wear.</i>

426
00:31:30,443 --> 00:31:34,346
Yes. Most kind of them.

427
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,447
You're a Stark
bannerman, Lord Bolton.

428
00:31:36,482 --> 00:31:39,117
I am acting on
Lady Stark's orders

429
00:31:39,151 --> 00:31:41,152
<i>to return Jaime Lannister</i>
<i>to King's Landing.</i>

430
00:31:41,186 --> 00:31:44,788
When King Robb left Harrenhal,
his mother was his prisoner.

431
00:31:44,823 --> 00:31:46,423
If she wasn't his mother,

432
00:31:46,457 --> 00:31:48,558
<i>he'd have hanged her</i>
<i>for treason.</i>

433
00:31:55,766 --> 00:31:58,033
I should send you
back to Robb Stark.

434
00:31:58,067 --> 00:32:00,302
You should.

435
00:32:00,337 --> 00:32:02,771
But instead,
you're sitting here

436
00:32:02,806 --> 00:32:05,441
watching me fail at dinner.

437
00:32:05,475 --> 00:32:07,643
Why might that be?

438
00:32:07,677 --> 00:32:09,545
Wars cost money.

439
00:32:09,579 --> 00:32:11,547
Many people would pay
a great deal for you.

440
00:32:11,581 --> 00:32:14,250
We both know
who would pay the most.

441
00:32:15,786 --> 00:32:17,353
<i>Or make you pay the most</i>

442
00:32:17,387 --> 00:32:19,054
if he found out
you had captured me

443
00:32:19,089 --> 00:32:21,323
and sent me back up north
for a summary execution.

444
00:32:21,358 --> 00:32:23,726
You're right.

445
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,563
Perhaps the safest thing to do is to
kill you both and burn your bodies.

446
00:32:27,598 --> 00:32:29,532
It would be,

447
00:32:29,567 --> 00:32:32,869
if you honestly believed my father
would never find out about it.

448
00:32:32,903 --> 00:32:35,571
King Robb is keeping
your father quite busy.

449
00:32:35,606 --> 00:32:37,940
He doesn't have time
for anything else.

450
00:32:37,975 --> 00:32:40,143
He'll make time for you.

451
00:32:43,481 --> 00:32:44,981
As soon as you're
well enough to travel,

452
00:32:45,016 --> 00:32:47,818
<i>I will allow you</i>
<i>to go to King's Landing</i>

453
00:32:47,852 --> 00:32:51,355
as restitution for the
mistakes my soldiers made.

454
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:54,758
And you will swear to tell
your father the truth,

455
00:32:54,793 --> 00:32:57,328
that I had nothing
to do with your maiming.

456
00:33:04,102 --> 00:33:06,770
- Shall we drink on it?
- I don't partake.

457
00:33:08,607 --> 00:33:12,310
You do understand how suspicious
that is to ordinary people?

458
00:33:13,779 --> 00:33:15,780
Very well.

459
00:33:15,814 --> 00:33:17,849
My lady,

460
00:33:17,883 --> 00:33:20,952
may our journey continue
without further incident.

461
00:33:20,986 --> 00:33:22,720
Oh, she won't be
going with you.

462
00:33:22,754 --> 00:33:25,456
I am charged with
bringing Ser Jaime to--

463
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:28,258
<i>You are charged</i>
<i>with abetting treason.</i>

464
00:33:28,293 --> 00:33:30,427
I'm afraid I must insist.

465
00:33:30,461 --> 00:33:33,129
<i>You're in no place</i>
<i>to insist on anything.</i>

466
00:33:33,163 --> 00:33:35,298
I would have hoped
you'd learned your lesson

467
00:33:35,332 --> 00:33:39,168
about overplaying
your position.

468
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,308
<i>- Impossible.</i>
- Why?

469
00:33:45,342 --> 00:33:47,677
My grandson is the pride
of Highgarden.

470
00:33:47,711 --> 00:33:50,847
<i>The most desirable bachelor</i>
<i>in all seven kingdoms.</i>

471
00:33:50,881 --> 00:33:53,483
- Your daughter--
- Is rich,

472
00:33:53,517 --> 00:33:57,253
the most beautiful woman
in all seven kingdoms...

473
00:33:58,489 --> 00:34:00,289
and the mother of the king.

474
00:34:00,324 --> 00:34:01,724
Old.

475
00:34:02,593 --> 00:34:03,593
Old?

476
00:34:03,627 --> 00:34:06,696
Old.

477
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:09,198
<i>I'm something of an expert</i>
<i>on the subject.</i>

478
00:34:09,232 --> 00:34:11,834
<i>Her change will be</i>
<i>upon her before long.</i>

479
00:34:11,869 --> 00:34:15,371
I'll spare you the details
of what will happen then.

480
00:34:15,405 --> 00:34:18,107
You men may have a stomach
for bloodshed and slaughter,

481
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:20,543
but this is another
matter entirely.

482
00:34:20,577 --> 00:34:24,213
The years punish us as well,
I promise you that.

483
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:30,620
My stomach remains
quite strong, however.

484
00:34:30,654 --> 00:34:32,489
The only thing
that might turn it

485
00:34:32,523 --> 00:34:36,226
are details of your grandson's
nocturnal activities.

486
00:34:37,528 --> 00:34:39,462
- <i>Do you deny them?</i>
- Oh, not at all.

487
00:34:39,496 --> 00:34:41,531
A sword swallower
through and through.

488
00:34:41,565 --> 00:34:43,332
And a boy with his affliction

489
00:34:43,367 --> 00:34:45,368
should be grateful
for the opportunity

490
00:34:45,402 --> 00:34:48,437
<i>to marry the most beautiful</i>
<i>woman in the kingdoms</i>

491
00:34:48,505 --> 00:34:50,338
and remove the stain
from his name.

492
00:34:50,373 --> 00:34:53,608
Did you grow up with boy
cousins, Lord Tywin?

493
00:34:53,642 --> 00:34:55,643
Sons of your father's
bannermen,

494
00:34:55,678 --> 00:34:57,512
squires, stable boys?

495
00:34:57,546 --> 00:34:59,847
Of course.

496
00:34:59,881 --> 00:35:03,050
And you never...

497
00:35:03,085 --> 00:35:05,119
No.

498
00:35:05,153 --> 00:35:07,154
Not once?

499
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:08,756
Not in any way?

500
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:10,658
Never.

501
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:13,628
I congratulate you
upon your restraint.

502
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:15,930
But it's a natural thing,
two boys having a go

503
00:35:15,964 --> 00:35:17,598
at each other
beneath the sheets.

504
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:20,201
Perhaps Highgarden
has a high tolerance

505
00:35:20,235 --> 00:35:22,136
for unnatural behavior.

506
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:23,604
<i>I wouldn't say that.</i>

507
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:25,907
True, we don't tie
ourselves in knots

508
00:35:25,941 --> 00:35:29,110
over a discreet
bit of buggery, but...

509
00:35:30,779 --> 00:35:32,881
brothers and sisters--

510
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:36,451
where I come from, that stain

511
00:35:36,486 --> 00:35:38,954
would be very difficult
to wash out.

512
00:35:38,988 --> 00:35:41,590
I will not breathe further life

513
00:35:41,625 --> 00:35:44,026
into a malicious lie
by discussing it.

514
00:35:45,896 --> 00:35:47,663
Lie or not,

515
00:35:47,697 --> 00:35:50,833
you must admit many people
find it quite convincing.

516
00:35:50,868 --> 00:35:53,403
Convincing enough
to put swords in their hands

517
00:35:53,437 --> 00:35:55,471
and send them off
to kill Lannisters

518
00:35:55,506 --> 00:35:58,541
and Tyrells thanks to
our new affiliation.

519
00:35:58,575 --> 00:36:00,643
I don't care
what people believe.

520
00:36:00,677 --> 00:36:03,512
And neither do you.

521
00:36:03,547 --> 00:36:07,116
As an authority
on myself, I must disagree.

522
00:36:07,184 --> 00:36:11,321
Now, if the rumors about
my children were true,

523
00:36:11,355 --> 00:36:14,257
then Joffrey is no king at all

524
00:36:14,291 --> 00:36:18,461
and House Tyrell is throwing its
prized flower into the dirt.

525
00:36:18,496 --> 00:36:22,199
And if Cersei is too old
to give Loras children,

526
00:36:22,233 --> 00:36:26,403
we're throwing another
prized flower into the dirt.

527
00:36:26,438 --> 00:36:29,974
It is a chance
we simply cannot take.

528
00:36:30,008 --> 00:36:32,543
The uncertainty
makes you uncomfortable.

529
00:36:33,946 --> 00:36:35,780
All right.

530
00:36:35,814 --> 00:36:38,348
I'll remove it for you.

531
00:36:38,383 --> 00:36:41,184
If you refuse to marry
Loras to Cersei,

532
00:36:41,219 --> 00:36:44,087
I will name him
to the Kingsguard.

533
00:36:44,121 --> 00:36:47,556
<i>I'm sure you're familiar</i>
<i>with the Kingsguard vows.</i>

534
00:36:47,591 --> 00:36:49,591
He will never marry.

535
00:36:49,626 --> 00:36:51,426
- He will never have children.
- Oh...

536
00:36:51,461 --> 00:36:53,361
<i>The Tyrell name will fade.</i>

537
00:36:53,396 --> 00:36:56,064
And Highgarden will go
to the children

538
00:36:56,098 --> 00:36:57,599
of Joffrey and Margaery.

539
00:36:57,633 --> 00:37:00,102
You would have
your grandson protected

540
00:37:00,136 --> 00:37:01,971
by someone who disgusts you?

541
00:37:02,005 --> 00:37:05,608
I would have my grandson
protected by a skilled warrior

542
00:37:05,642 --> 00:37:08,979
who takes his vows seriously.

543
00:37:09,013 --> 00:37:11,848
So, shall I draw up the order?

544
00:37:13,384 --> 00:37:15,786
Or do you consent
to this marriage?

545
00:37:20,457 --> 00:37:22,491
It's a rare enough thing--

546
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:26,429
a man who lives up
to his reputation.

547
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,614
No!

548
00:38:40,202 --> 00:38:42,003
We've gotta cut them loose!

549
00:38:42,037 --> 00:38:44,305
No!

550
00:39:29,786 --> 00:39:31,553
Take my hand!

551
00:40:07,425 --> 00:40:09,493
<i>That's a wonderful pin.</i>

552
00:40:09,527 --> 00:40:13,030
Oh, it's more
of a brooch, really.

553
00:40:16,301 --> 00:40:19,737
Though I suppose a brooch
is a sort of pin, so...

554
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:28,445
I'm very happy about...

555
00:40:28,479 --> 00:40:30,280
Uh, yes.

556
00:40:30,315 --> 00:40:32,482
I-I am as well.

557
00:40:34,786 --> 00:40:36,820
I feel like I'm in a dream.

558
00:40:36,855 --> 00:40:40,625
Yes, me, too.
Definitely.

559
00:40:40,659 --> 00:40:43,194
I've dreamed of a large wedding
since I was quite young.

560
00:40:43,229 --> 00:40:44,429
The guests,

561
00:40:44,463 --> 00:40:47,632
the food, the tournaments.

562
00:40:50,704 --> 00:40:53,239
And the bride, of course.

563
00:40:57,044 --> 00:40:59,679
The most beautiful bride
in the world

564
00:40:59,713 --> 00:41:01,313
in a beautiful gown of gold

565
00:41:01,348 --> 00:41:03,916
and green brocade
with fringed sleeves.

566
00:41:06,353 --> 00:41:08,588
Have you ever been
to Highgarden, my lady?

567
00:41:09,723 --> 00:41:11,357
No. I had never
left Winterfell

568
00:41:11,391 --> 00:41:14,394
before I came
to King's Landing.

569
00:41:14,428 --> 00:41:15,995
But it sounds wonderful.

570
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:18,631
I can't wait to see it.

571
00:41:18,666 --> 00:41:20,767
And to leave this place.

572
00:41:21,869 --> 00:41:23,637
It's terrible, isn't it?

573
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:28,642
The most terrible
place there is.

574
00:41:38,153 --> 00:41:41,388
<i>I don't suppose there's
anything we can do about this.</i>

575
00:41:41,422 --> 00:41:43,690
We can have them both killed.

576
00:41:45,493 --> 00:41:47,460
It's hard to say
which of the four of us

577
00:41:47,495 --> 00:41:50,497
is getting the worst
of this arrangement.

578
00:41:50,531 --> 00:41:52,465
Probably Sansa.

579
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,334
Though Loras
will certainly come to know

580
00:41:54,368 --> 00:41:57,137
a deep and singular misery.

581
00:41:57,171 --> 00:41:59,907
Father doesn't discriminate.

582
00:41:59,941 --> 00:42:02,777
We're all being shipped
off to hell together.

583
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:04,912
On a boat you built.

584
00:42:04,947 --> 00:42:07,983
The Tyrells were plotting
to undermine our family.

585
00:42:08,017 --> 00:42:10,553
I did what I did
to protect our family.

586
00:42:10,587 --> 00:42:12,688
I'm your family.

587
00:42:13,623 --> 00:42:15,658
A member of your family

588
00:42:15,692 --> 00:42:18,728
who has actively contributed
to that family's survival.

589
00:42:19,796 --> 00:42:21,563
Whether or not you or Father

590
00:42:21,598 --> 00:42:23,599
or anyone else
wants to admit it.

591
00:42:23,634 --> 00:42:25,935
I do admit it.

592
00:42:25,969 --> 00:42:28,604
If it weren't for your trick
with the wildfire,

593
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:31,941
Stannis would have sacked the
city before Father got here.

594
00:42:31,975 --> 00:42:35,044
<i>Our heads would still be</i>
<i>rotting on the city gate.</i>

595
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:39,415
Trying to have me killed is an
odd way of saying thank you.

596
00:42:41,552 --> 00:42:43,620
There are two people
in King's Landing

597
00:42:43,654 --> 00:42:45,821
who can give an order
to a Kingsguard.

598
00:42:45,856 --> 00:42:48,825
Did you or did you not
order Ser Mandon

599
00:42:48,859 --> 00:42:51,761
<i>to kill me during the
Battle of the Blackwater?</i>

600
00:43:01,337 --> 00:43:03,772
The impulse I understand.

601
00:43:04,975 --> 00:43:07,910
He hates me
because I'm the only one

602
00:43:07,944 --> 00:43:10,813
who tells him
what he really is.

603
00:43:13,683 --> 00:43:18,120
So, fair enough.
He wants me dead.

604
00:43:18,155 --> 00:43:20,156
But his stupidity?

605
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:24,193
He could have had me poisoned
and no one would have known.

606
00:43:24,228 --> 00:43:27,696
But the king
orders a Kingsguard

607
00:43:27,731 --> 00:43:29,899
to murder the Hand of the King

608
00:43:29,933 --> 00:43:31,834
in full view of his own army.

609
00:43:31,868 --> 00:43:33,402
The boy's an idiot.

610
00:43:33,437 --> 00:43:34,837
What do you want me to say?

611
00:43:34,871 --> 00:43:37,873
I want you to tell me if my
life is still in danger.

612
00:43:37,908 --> 00:43:39,642
Probably.

613
00:43:39,676 --> 00:43:41,377
But not from Joffrey.

614
00:43:41,412 --> 00:43:43,579
He won't do anything
now Father's here.

615
00:43:45,249 --> 00:43:47,851
Seven kingdoms united in fear

616
00:43:47,885 --> 00:43:50,019
of Tywin Lannister.

617
00:43:50,054 --> 00:43:52,422
Not the Tyrells.

618
00:43:52,456 --> 00:43:54,491
Soon they won't need
to be afraid of him.

619
00:43:54,525 --> 00:43:55,959
Joffrey will belong
to Margaery,

620
00:43:55,993 --> 00:43:57,894
the little
doe-eyed whore.

621
00:43:57,928 --> 00:44:00,930
And so will his children
and their children.

622
00:44:00,965 --> 00:44:03,200
History will be taken
from our hands.

623
00:44:05,203 --> 00:44:07,771
You may escape, at least.

624
00:44:07,805 --> 00:44:09,439
Once Jaime gets back,

625
00:44:09,474 --> 00:44:11,975
Ser Loras may come down
with a terrible case

626
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:15,212
of sword through bowels.

627
00:44:15,246 --> 00:44:17,214
When Jaime gets back, yes.

628
00:44:17,248 --> 00:44:18,916
But when do we think
that's going to be?

629
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:20,784
He's out there somewhere.

630
00:44:22,587 --> 00:44:26,457
Jaime or not, I'm truly fucked.

631
00:44:29,528 --> 00:44:31,663
Who's going to tell her?

632
00:44:33,065 --> 00:44:35,399
Do you think
people will like it?

633
00:44:35,434 --> 00:44:37,935
I don't think they
will even notice it.

634
00:44:37,969 --> 00:44:40,438
You're right.
It's not my wedding.

635
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:43,408
Anyway, from what I can tell,

636
00:44:43,442 --> 00:44:45,610
the dressmakers in Highgarden
will be far superior

637
00:44:45,644 --> 00:44:47,211
to the ones in King's Landing.

638
00:44:47,246 --> 00:44:50,581
They'd never make me anything
as dull as this for my wedding.

639
00:44:51,784 --> 00:44:54,485
Loras likes green
and gold brocade.

640
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,387
I'm sure he does.

641
00:44:57,856 --> 00:44:59,790
Will they let me
invite my family?

642
00:44:59,825 --> 00:45:02,226
They haven't asked my opinion.

643
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:04,629
But do you think they will?

644
00:45:04,663 --> 00:45:06,264
No.

645
00:45:13,205 --> 00:45:14,905
Lady Sansa,
Lord Tyrion to see you.

646
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:17,775
- Should I--
- I beg your pardon, my lady.

647
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:20,178
Good afternoon, Lord Tyrion.

648
00:45:20,213 --> 00:45:22,748
I was just trying on a gown
for King Joffrey's wedding.

649
00:45:24,217 --> 00:45:28,687
Yes, it should be
quite a wedding.

650
00:45:28,721 --> 00:45:31,123
I need to speak
with you, Lady Sansa.

651
00:45:31,158 --> 00:45:32,658
Of course.

652
00:45:32,692 --> 00:45:35,361
Alone, if I may.

653
00:45:35,396 --> 00:45:37,096
Why do you need
to speak to her alone?

654
00:45:37,131 --> 00:45:38,932
Shae.

655
00:45:38,966 --> 00:45:40,733
Please excuse her, Lord Tyrion.

656
00:45:40,768 --> 00:45:42,269
<i>She's not from here.</i>

657
00:45:42,303 --> 00:45:43,503
But I trust her,

658
00:45:43,537 --> 00:45:45,806
even though
she tells me not to.

659
00:45:47,475 --> 00:45:51,312
Sometimes we think
we want to hear something

660
00:45:51,346 --> 00:45:54,415
<i>and it's only afterwards</i>
<i>when it's too late</i>

661
00:45:54,449 --> 00:45:57,217
that we realize
we wished we'd heard it

662
00:45:57,252 --> 00:45:59,386
under entirely
different circumstances.

663
00:45:59,421 --> 00:46:01,255
It's all right, really.

664
00:46:04,792 --> 00:46:07,027
How to begin?

665
00:46:09,597 --> 00:46:12,165
It's-- this--

666
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:15,836
this-- this is awkward.

667
00:46:17,872 --> 00:46:19,906
1,000 blades

668
00:46:19,941 --> 00:46:23,009
taken from the hands
of Aegon's fallen enemies,

669
00:46:23,044 --> 00:46:26,446
forged in the fiery breath
of Balerion the Dread.

670
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,216
There aren't 1,000 blades.

671
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:31,818
There aren't even 200.

672
00:46:31,853 --> 00:46:33,354
I've counted.

673
00:46:33,388 --> 00:46:36,023
Ha, I'm sure you have.

674
00:46:36,057 --> 00:46:38,793
Ugly old thing.

675
00:46:38,827 --> 00:46:41,929
Yet it has a certain appeal.

676
00:46:41,964 --> 00:46:44,399
The Lysa Arryn of chairs.

677
00:46:44,433 --> 00:46:47,201
<i>Shame you had to settle</i>
<i>for your second choice.</i>

678
00:46:47,236 --> 00:46:49,504
Early days, my friend.

679
00:46:49,538 --> 00:46:52,473
It is flattering, really...

680
00:46:53,776 --> 00:46:56,444
you feeling such dread

681
00:46:56,478 --> 00:46:58,946
at the prospect of me
getting what I want.

682
00:46:58,981 --> 00:47:01,783
Thwarting you has never
been my primary ambition,

683
00:47:01,817 --> 00:47:03,651
I promise you.

684
00:47:03,686 --> 00:47:07,088
Although who doesn't like to see
their friends fail now and then?

685
00:47:07,122 --> 00:47:08,389
You're so right.

686
00:47:08,424 --> 00:47:10,225
For instance,

687
00:47:10,259 --> 00:47:11,960
when I thwarted your plan

688
00:47:11,994 --> 00:47:14,062
to give Sansa Stark
to the Tyrells.

689
00:47:14,096 --> 00:47:16,197
If I'm going to be honest,

690
00:47:16,231 --> 00:47:18,099
I did feel
an unmistakable sense

691
00:47:18,133 --> 00:47:21,602
of enjoyment there.

692
00:47:21,637 --> 00:47:24,238
But your confidant,

693
00:47:24,273 --> 00:47:27,742
the one who fed you
information about my plans,

694
00:47:27,776 --> 00:47:30,511
the one you swore to protect...

695
00:47:31,847 --> 00:47:34,448
you didn't bring her
any enjoyment.

696
00:47:35,617 --> 00:47:39,086
And she didn't bring me
any enjoyment.

697
00:47:39,121 --> 00:47:42,323
She was a bad
investment on my part.

698
00:47:44,025 --> 00:47:47,161
Luckily, I have a friend

699
00:47:47,195 --> 00:47:49,563
who wanted to try
something new.

700
00:47:49,597 --> 00:47:53,100
Something daring.

701
00:47:53,135 --> 00:47:56,937
And he was so grateful
to me for providing

702
00:47:56,972 --> 00:48:00,240
this fresh experience.

703
00:48:04,311 --> 00:48:07,113
I did what I did
for the good of the realm.

704
00:48:07,147 --> 00:48:09,782
The realm?

705
00:48:09,816 --> 00:48:12,217
Do you know what the realm is?

706
00:48:13,987 --> 00:48:17,189
It's the thousand blades
of Aegon's enemies.

707
00:48:17,223 --> 00:48:22,161
A story we agree to tell
each other over and over

708
00:48:22,195 --> 00:48:24,663
till we forget that it's a lie.

709
00:48:24,697 --> 00:48:29,268
But what do we have left
once we abandon the lie?

710
00:48:29,302 --> 00:48:31,237
Chaos.

711
00:48:31,271 --> 00:48:33,973
A gaping pit waiting
to swallow us all.

712
00:48:34,007 --> 00:48:37,543
Chaos isn't a pit.

713
00:48:37,578 --> 00:48:39,945
Chaos is a ladder.

714
00:48:42,115 --> 00:48:44,616
<i>Many who try to climb it fail</i>

715
00:48:44,651 --> 00:48:47,085
<i>and never get to try again.</i>

716
00:48:48,187 --> 00:48:50,755
<i>The fall breaks them.</i>

717
00:48:59,198 --> 00:49:02,900
<i>And some are given</i>
<i>a chance to climb,</i>

718
00:49:02,935 --> 00:49:05,402
<i>but they refuse.</i>

719
00:49:05,437 --> 00:49:08,772
<i>They cling to the realm</i>

720
00:49:08,806 --> 00:49:10,807
<i>or the gods</i>

721
00:49:10,841 --> 00:49:13,276
<i>or love.</i>

722
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:15,545
<i>Illusions.</i>

723
00:49:16,747 --> 00:49:19,515
<i>Only the ladder is real.</i>

724
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:22,852
<i>The climb is all there is.</i>

725
00:51:55,489 --> 00:52:05,948
