1
00:00:04,735 --> 00:00:05,486
Shh, quiet, Hodor

2
00:00:05,497 --> 00:00:06,549
Make him shut up

3
00:00:11,827 --> 00:00:13,477
I'm going beyond the Wall
to Craster's Keep

4
00:00:13,489 --> 00:00:15,200
to capture the mutineers
holed up there

5
00:00:15,418 --> 00:00:16,628
Who will join me?

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,152
If it's a fight you're heading for,
then you need men who know how

7
00:00:23,421 --> 00:00:25,022
They have my brother's wolf

8
00:00:26,113 --> 00:00:27,154
They have Ghost

9
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,224
We're not safe here.
We need to go

10
00:00:30,992 --> 00:00:32,048
Who are you?

11
00:00:32,158 --> 00:00:33,699
I'm Brandon Stark!

12
00:00:33,703 --> 00:00:34,926
It's Jon Snow's brother

13
00:00:35,507 --> 00:00:38,396
And I thought this was gonna
be another boring day

14
00:00:39,578 --> 00:00:40,788
I don't need a squire

15
00:00:40,802 --> 00:00:42,024
He'll slow me down

16
00:00:42,032 --> 00:00:43,134
He's not safe here

17
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,747
Good-bye, Brienne

18
00:00:48,288 --> 00:00:50,093
<i>Myrcella is my only daughter.</i></i>

19
00:00:50,108 --> 00:00:52,860
Do you really think I'll let you
sell her like a common whore?

20
00:00:52,896 --> 00:00:54,667
Dorne is the safest
place for her

21
00:00:54,711 --> 00:00:57,126
The Martells loathe us.
She'll be a hostage

22
00:00:57,503 --> 00:00:59,656
If you were to marry Cersei,

23
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,085
she'd murder you in your sleep.

24
00:01:01,107 --> 00:01:03,718
Luckily for you
you'll never marry her

25
00:01:04,142 --> 00:01:05,330
A rider in the night

26
00:01:05,364 --> 00:01:06,309
from your sister

27
00:01:07,022 --> 00:01:08,846
Lysa says Jon Arryn was murdered

28
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:09,884
By the Lannisters

29
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,364
If this news is true

30
00:01:11,646 --> 00:01:13,623
who but you can protect the king?

31
00:01:14,047 --> 00:01:15,315
The lord of all the Vale

32
00:01:15,346 --> 00:01:17,047
You'll leave for the Eyrie
as soon as possible

33
00:01:17,063 --> 00:01:19,017
and bring Lysa Arryn
into the fold

34
00:01:19,055 --> 00:01:20,125
Did you kill Joffrey?

35
00:01:20,236 --> 00:01:23,354
<i>Do you remember that lovely
necklace Dontos gave you?</i></i>

36
00:01:23,365 --> 00:01:24,866
that a stone was missing

37
00:01:25,139 --> 00:01:25,964
The poison

38
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:28,629
That was something my new
friends wanted very badly

39
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:31,510
You don't think I'd let you
marry that beast, do you?

40
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:33,218
You just do
what needs to be done

41
00:01:33,561 --> 00:01:35,573
Word has it
I'm to be your bride

42
00:01:35,732 --> 00:01:38,251
we ought to get
to know one another

43
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:39,223
But if my mother
found out

44
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,364
It can be our secret

45
00:01:41,006 --> 00:01:42,309
Tell me a secret

46
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:42,304
<i>May the Warrior
grant him courage</i>

47
00:03:42,338 --> 00:03:45,657
and protect him
in these perilous times.

48
00:03:45,675 --> 00:03:48,126
May the Smith
grant him strength

49
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,012
that he might bear
this heavy burden

50
00:03:50,046 --> 00:03:52,264
And may the Crone,

51
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:54,633
she that knows
the fate of all men,

52
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:57,269
show him the path
he must walk

53
00:03:57,303 --> 00:04:00,722
and guide him through the
dark places that lie ahead.

54
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:04,059
In the light of the Seven,
I now proclaim Tommen

55
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,945
of the House Baratheon
First of His Name

56
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,731
King of the Andals
and the First Men

57
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:12,618
and Lord of
the Seven Kingdoms.

58
00:04:15,738 --> 00:04:17,623
Long may he reign!

59
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,658
Long may he reign!

60
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:31,420
Special day.

61
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:52,107
Your Grace.

62
00:04:53,943 --> 00:04:55,944
Your Grace.

63
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:22,054
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

64
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:39,688
Your Grace.

65
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,710
There he is.

66
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:46,945
Long may he reign.

67
00:05:46,963 --> 00:05:48,747
Long may he reign.

68
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:55,053
He sits the throne
like he was born to it.

69
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:58,757
Yes. He wasn't,
though, was he?

70
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,309
No, he wasn't.

71
00:06:06,816 --> 00:06:09,234
You still mourn
for Joffrey?

72
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:11,469
He was my husband.
My king.

73
00:06:11,487 --> 00:06:13,605
He would have been
your nightmare.

74
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:19,861
Your Grace, I feel--

75
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:22,047
You knew exactly
what he was.

76
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:24,666
I did, too.

77
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,151
You never love
anything in the world

78
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:28,587
the way you love
your first child.

79
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,791
Doesn't matter
what they do.

80
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:38,213
And what he did,
it shocked me.

81
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,801
Do you think
I'm easily shocked?

82
00:06:42,853 --> 00:06:44,236
No.

83
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:47,672
The things he did
shocked me.

84
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,981
He's only a boy.

85
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:58,516
A good boy.
A decent boy.

86
00:06:58,534 --> 00:07:00,402
He always has been.

87
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:03,622
<i>Who was the last
decent king, I wonder?</i>

88
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:05,540
He could be the first man
who sits on that throne

89
00:07:05,575 --> 00:07:08,326
in 50 years
to actually deserve it.

90
00:07:09,745 --> 00:07:12,464
It would be some
consolation, wouldn't it?

91
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:15,534
For all the horror
that put him there.

92
00:07:20,223 --> 00:07:22,774
He will need help...

93
00:07:24,427 --> 00:07:26,144
if he's going
to rule well.

94
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:28,146
He has you.

95
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:30,765
A mother is not enough.

96
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:35,353
You're still interested
in being queen, I take it?

97
00:07:35,387 --> 00:07:37,189
Oh.

98
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:39,274
After all
that's happened--

99
00:07:41,911 --> 00:07:45,396
it sounds strange,
I know, but I am--

100
00:07:45,414 --> 00:07:47,833
I haven't even given
any thought to it,

101
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,618
what comes next.

102
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:52,871
It would be a great
honor, of course.

103
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:56,007
But I will have to speak
to my father about it.

104
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:00,378
Yes, speak to
your father.

105
00:08:00,412 --> 00:08:03,298
I'll speak to mine.

106
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:11,439
We may be faced with an alarming
number of weddings soon.

107
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:15,227
I won't even know
what to call you.

108
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:18,063
Sister?

109
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:21,983
Or Mother?

110
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:24,536
Hmm.

111
00:08:25,555 --> 00:08:28,106
King Joffrey Baratheon
is dead.

112
00:08:29,992 --> 00:08:31,560
Murdered at his
own wedding.

113
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:34,963
<i>And we have taken the
Meereenese navy, Your Grace.</i>

114
00:08:34,997 --> 00:08:37,215
The Second Sons took
the Meereenese navy.

115
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,251
Who told you
to take the navy?

116
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:41,419
No one.

117
00:08:41,453 --> 00:08:43,922
So why did you do it?

118
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:45,974
I heard
you liked ships.

119
00:08:49,979 --> 00:08:51,596
How many ships?

120
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,898
93, Your Grace.

121
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:54,266
How many men
can they carry?

122
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,185
9,300,
not counting sailors.

123
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:59,154
Would that be enough
to take King's Landing?

124
00:08:59,188 --> 00:09:01,022
The Lannisters have more.

125
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:03,441
<i>- They've been fighting
- Joffrey's wars for years.</i>

126
00:09:03,475 --> 00:09:05,310
They're tired,
dispersed.

127
00:09:05,328 --> 00:09:07,612
<i>And now their king
is dead.</i>

128
00:09:07,646 --> 00:09:11,249
8,000 Unsullied,
2,000 Second Sons

129
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:13,785
<i>sailing into
Blackwater Bay</i>

130
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:16,588
<i>and storming the gates
without warning.</i>

131
00:09:19,542 --> 00:09:22,210
It's hard to say.
It could be enough.

132
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:25,797
But we're not fighting to make
you queen of King's Landing.

133
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:28,800
10,000 men
can't conquer Westeros.

134
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:30,502
The old houses
will flock to our queen

135
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:32,103
when she crosses
the Narrow Sea.

136
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:34,940
The old houses will flock to
whichever side they think will win,

137
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:37,058
as they always have.

138
00:09:39,195 --> 00:09:41,363
There's other news.

139
00:09:41,397 --> 00:09:43,181
From Yunkai.

140
00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:46,568
Without the Unsullied
to enforce your rule,

141
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:49,487
<i>the Wise Masters have
retaken control of the city.</i>

142
00:09:49,521 --> 00:09:52,540
<i>They've reenslaved the
freedmen who stayed behind</i>

143
00:09:52,575 --> 00:09:54,709
and sworn to take
revenge against you.

144
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,129
And in Astapor,

145
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,882
the council you installed
to rule over the city

146
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:04,035
has been overthrown
by a butcher named Cleon

147
00:10:04,053 --> 00:10:07,389
<i>who's declared himself
"His Imperial Majesty."</i>

148
00:10:09,392 --> 00:10:11,343
Please leave me.

149
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:18,650
Not you, Jorah.

150
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:33,615
It appears my liberation
of Slaver's Bay

151
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,667
isn't going
quite as planned.

152
00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:39,587
You could sail for Westeros

153
00:10:39,622 --> 00:10:41,623
and leave it all behind.

154
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,341
A boy sits on
the Iron Throne.

155
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:46,577
A boy many believe to be a
bastard with no right to it.

156
00:10:46,595 --> 00:10:49,431
They've never been
more vulnerable.

157
00:10:49,465 --> 00:10:52,884
You counseled me against
rashness once in Qarth.

158
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:55,520
I didn't listen.

159
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:57,689
That all worked out well.

160
00:11:04,547 --> 00:11:07,315
How can I rule
seven kingdoms

161
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:10,068
if I can't control
Slaver's Bay?

162
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:14,122
Why should anyone
trust me?

163
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:16,774
Why should anyone
follow me?

164
00:11:16,792 --> 00:11:18,259
<i>You're a Targaryen.</i>

165
00:11:18,294 --> 00:11:20,328
You're the Mother
of Dragons.

166
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,749
I need to be
more than that.

167
00:11:31,006 --> 00:11:35,927
I will not let those I have
freed slide back into chains.

168
00:11:37,012 --> 00:11:38,930
I will not sail
for Westeros.

169
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:40,965
What, then?

170
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:44,869
I will do
what queens do.

171
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,108
I will rule.

172
00:12:25,528 --> 00:12:27,479
Pull up your hood.

173
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:31,816
A memorable shade.

174
00:12:33,068 --> 00:12:34,702
But how would
they know?

175
00:12:34,737 --> 00:12:38,206
You know what kind of stories
poor men enjoy the most?

176
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,159
Ones about rich girls
they'll never meet.

177
00:12:45,881 --> 00:12:48,049
Is this the only way
into the Eyrie?

178
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,251
The mountains
are impassable.

179
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:51,836
If you want to get
to the Eyrie,

180
00:12:51,887 --> 00:12:53,755
you need to go through
the Bloody Gate.

181
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:57,258
It doesn't matter how
large your army is,

182
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:59,978
if you attack this gate,
you do it on this road,

183
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:02,013
three men abreast

184
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:04,599
and get slaughtered
like goats.

185
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,602
The first Lords of the
Vale didn't have much,

186
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:09,220
but they had
these mountains

187
00:13:09,238 --> 00:13:11,189
and they knew
how to use them.

188
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:13,942
And the fortress they built
here has never been overcome.

189
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:16,744
Not once in 1,000 years.

190
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:19,531
Know your strengths,
use them wisely,

191
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:22,951
and one man
can be worth 10,000.

192
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:29,908
Who would pass
the Bloody Gate?

193
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:33,211
Lord Petyr Baelish
and his niece Alayne.

194
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:38,933
Stand to.

195
00:13:38,968 --> 00:13:41,603
- Stand to!
- Stand to!

196
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:44,389
Welcome back,
Lord Baelish.

197
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:16,888
Uncle Petyr!

198
00:14:19,141 --> 00:14:21,392
<i>My lord.</i>

199
00:14:26,965 --> 00:14:29,100
Oh.

200
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:33,354
I have brought you
a gift.

201
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:39,527
Lord Baelish.

202
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:42,280
- My lady. - Look what
Uncle Petyr brought me.

203
00:14:42,331 --> 00:14:44,949
A beautiful gift
for a beautiful boy.

204
00:14:44,983 --> 00:14:47,669
It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance, Lady Arryn.

205
00:14:47,703 --> 00:14:49,203
My name is Al--

206
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:51,706
Oh, do take down
that hood, child.

207
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:53,824
Don't you think know
who you are?

208
00:14:53,842 --> 00:14:56,678
<i>You think
I'd let my intended</i>

209
00:14:56,712 --> 00:14:58,680
leave the Eyrie
on urgent business

210
00:14:58,714 --> 00:15:01,349
without knowing
what that business was?

211
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:06,688
I let him go so he could
bring you here to me.

212
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:12,727
My flesh and blood.

213
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:16,681
It's wonderful
to meet you, Aunt Lysa.

214
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:18,983
You mustn't call me that
in front of anyone else.

215
00:15:19,017 --> 00:15:20,151
Of course.
I understand.

216
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:21,786
No one can know
you're here.

217
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,905
It would put us in a very
precarious position.

218
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:25,540
I would never
say a thing.

219
00:15:25,574 --> 00:15:28,126
The Lannisters
want to destroy us.

220
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,078
They've been
trying for years.

221
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:32,163
<i>Now they know
what it feels like.</i>

222
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:36,000
Mummy said they killed your mother and
they chopped off your brother's head.

223
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:41,222
They did,
and my father's.

224
00:15:41,256 --> 00:15:43,841
They killed my father,
too, with poison.

225
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:47,979
I wanted to make the little
Lannister baby man fly,

226
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:50,214
but Mother
said I couldn't.

227
00:15:50,232 --> 00:15:52,049
Make him fly?

228
00:15:52,067 --> 00:15:54,102
Through the Moon Door.

229
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,925
<i>And on top of
everything else,</i>

230
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,494
they made you marry
that filthy troll.

231
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,697
They did.
They made us both.

232
00:16:05,748 --> 00:16:07,115
Lord Tyrion
didn't want to.

233
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,067
<i>I don't believe that
for a moment.</i>

234
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:11,119
Did he force himself
on you?

235
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,870
No.

236
00:16:12,904 --> 00:16:14,422
<i>- We never--
Good.</i>

237
00:16:14,456 --> 00:16:17,842
Robin, this is
your cousin Sansa.

238
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:20,044
But you're not to call
her Sansa in front of anyone

239
00:16:20,095 --> 00:16:21,912
but Uncle Petyr and myself.
Do you understand?

240
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:24,349
Sansa, this is
my son Robin.

241
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:27,518
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Robin.

242
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,887
Robin, show Sansa
to her chamber.

243
00:16:29,938 --> 00:16:32,106
Take the back stairs.

244
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:37,061
Go.
We'll speak soon.

245
00:16:45,988 --> 00:16:47,938
What took you so long?

246
00:16:47,956 --> 00:16:50,941
Arranging for the ascension
of King Tommen I,

247
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,579
extricating Sansa,
getting her here alive.

248
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:58,416
She's here. We've spent more than
enough time on her for one evening.

249
00:17:00,669 --> 00:17:02,637
Let's get married tonight.

250
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:04,972
Ought we not...

251
00:17:05,007 --> 00:17:08,092
inform the Lords of the
Vale about the ceremony?

252
00:17:08,126 --> 00:17:10,011
There's only one
Lord of the Vale.

253
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:11,896
The others can all hang.

254
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,348
Lurking and simpering
on the stairs like buzzards

255
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,819
the moment my husband died,
trying to get their claws in me.

256
00:17:17,853 --> 00:17:19,353
I do think that
we could wait until--

257
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:21,739
I'm done waiting, Petyr.

258
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:24,141
We had our wedding night
many years ago.

259
00:17:24,159 --> 00:17:26,244
Or don't you remember?

260
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:29,247
Like it was yesterday.

261
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:33,451
What wife would do for you
the things I've done for you?

262
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:36,337
What wife would trust you
the way I've trusted you?

263
00:17:36,371 --> 00:17:39,207
When you gave me
those drops

264
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:41,676
and told me to pour
them into Jon's wine,

265
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,177
my husband's wine--

266
00:17:43,212 --> 00:17:46,380
when you told me
to write a letter to Cat

267
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,766
telling her it was
the Lannisters--

268
00:18:01,063 --> 00:18:02,980
The deed is done.

269
00:18:03,014 --> 00:18:05,683
Faded into nothing.

270
00:18:05,701 --> 00:18:08,653
Only speaking of it
can make it real.

271
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,708
Tonight it is, then.

272
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,164
Let me bathe and dress
for the occasion.

273
00:18:20,198 --> 00:18:23,634
Once I'm presentable, I'll call
on the septon immediately.

274
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:32,560
I'm warning you.

275
00:18:32,594 --> 00:18:36,681
I'm going to scream when my
husband makes love to me.

276
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:39,901
I'm going
to scream so loud,

277
00:18:39,935 --> 00:18:43,020
they'll hear me clear
across the Narrow Sea.

278
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,315
When will the wedding
take place in your mind?

279
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,050
As soon as
decency permits.

280
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:17,088
After we've allowed Tommen the
appropriate time to mourn his brother

281
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:19,857
and Margaery
to mourn her husband.

282
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:22,360
- A fortnight?
- That seems reasonable.

283
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:25,396
No jugglers,
no jousting dwarves,

284
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:28,733
no 77-course meals.

285
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:33,171
And your wedding
to Loras?

286
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:35,790
Shortly after Tommen's.

287
00:19:35,824 --> 00:19:38,209
- Shortly?
- A fortnight.

288
00:19:39,294 --> 00:19:41,495
I know
you don't like them.

289
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:43,948
I didn't like
your husband.

290
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:46,184
Used to pat me
on the back a lot.

291
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:47,818
I didn't trust him.

292
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,854
We had that in common.

293
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:53,491
You don't need to make formal
alliances with people you trust.

294
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:56,143
Then whom can we trust?

295
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:59,931
Ourselves alone.

296
00:20:02,317 --> 00:20:04,468
The Tyrells

297
00:20:04,486 --> 00:20:07,104
are our only
true rivals

298
00:20:07,155 --> 00:20:08,856
in terms of resources

299
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:12,109
and we need them
on our side.

300
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,579
Robert wasn't
particularly rich.

301
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:17,832
Robert had me
funding him.

302
00:20:17,866 --> 00:20:21,118
Wars swallow gold
like a pit in the earth.

303
00:20:21,152 --> 00:20:24,505
I suppose that explains why we
did so well in the last one.

304
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:28,593
Do you know how much gold was mined
in the Westerlands this past year?

305
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:29,760
Haven't a clue.

306
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:31,495
Go on, your best guess.

307
00:20:31,513 --> 00:20:34,298
Pounds, tons, ounces?

308
00:20:34,332 --> 00:20:36,801
Doesn't matter.
The answer is the same.

309
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:39,470
That can't be.

310
00:20:39,521 --> 00:20:42,556
Our last working mine
ran dry three years ago.

311
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:45,693
Then how do we
pay for anything?

312
00:20:45,727 --> 00:20:48,145
The crown owes
the Iron Bank of Braavos

313
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:49,814
a tremendous amount
of money.

314
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:51,449
How much?

315
00:20:52,868 --> 00:20:54,619
A tremendous amount.

316
00:20:56,371 --> 00:20:58,823
There must be someone
at the Iron Bank

317
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:01,292
you can speak to,
come to some arrangement.

318
00:21:01,327 --> 00:21:03,077
The Iron Bank
is the Iron Bank.

319
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:04,712
There is no someone.

320
00:21:04,746 --> 00:21:07,331
Someone does work there.
It is comprised of people.

321
00:21:07,382 --> 00:21:09,467
And a temple
is comprised of stones.

322
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:12,420
One stone crumbles
and another takes its place.

323
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:17,091
And the temple holds its form
for 1,000 years or more.

324
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:20,728
That's what the Iron
Bank is-- a temple.

325
00:21:20,762 --> 00:21:23,981
We all live in its shadow
and almost none of us know it.

326
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:27,551
You can't run from them.
You can't cheat them.

327
00:21:27,569 --> 00:21:30,288
You can't sway them
with excuses.

328
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:33,958
If you owe them money and you
don't want to crumble yourself,

329
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:36,444
you pay it back.

330
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:38,279
Vesting the Tyrells
in the crown

331
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,114
will help a great deal
in this respect.

332
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:43,968
It's for the good of the
family, I understand that.

333
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,623
I'm not sure
my brothers do.

334
00:21:53,411 --> 00:21:56,964
I know you're building
a strong case against Tyrion.

335
00:21:57,015 --> 00:22:00,184
<i>And as a mother,
that is your right.</i>

336
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:04,722
But as a judge, I cannot
discuss the trial with you.

337
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:06,891
I respect that.

338
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:11,562
We don't need
to discuss it.

339
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:17,535
The Lannister legacy is the
only thing that matters.

340
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:20,738
You've started wars
to protect this family.

341
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:23,107
Turned your back
on Jaime

342
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:26,177
for refusing to
contribute to its future.

343
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:29,447
What does Tyrion deserve

344
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:32,033
for lighting
that future on fire?

345
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:43,978
<i>Joffrey.</i>

346
00:22:44,012 --> 00:22:46,180
Cersei.

347
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:48,182
Walder Frey.

348
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:50,468
Meryn Trant.

349
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:53,304
<i>Tywin Lannister.</i>

350
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:55,439
The Red Woman.

351
00:22:55,473 --> 00:22:57,825
Beric Dondarrion.

352
00:22:57,859 --> 00:23:00,945
<i>Thoros of Myr.</i>

353
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:02,913
<i>Ilyn Payne.</i>

354
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:04,782
The Mountain.

355
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:06,751
Would you shut up?

356
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:10,171
I can't sleep
until I say the names.

357
00:23:10,205 --> 00:23:13,841
The names of every
fucking person in Westeros?

358
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:16,710
Only the ones
I'm going to kill.

359
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:21,165
Hate's as good a thing
as any to keep a person going.

360
00:23:21,183 --> 00:23:23,717
Better than most.

361
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,271
We come across my brother,

362
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:30,775
maybe we can both cross
a name off our list.

363
00:23:33,862 --> 00:23:36,564
If he were here right now,
what would you do?

364
00:23:44,522 --> 00:23:46,490
I'd tell him
to shut the fuck up

365
00:23:46,524 --> 00:23:48,659
so I can get some sleep.

366
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,632
Go on,
get it over with,

367
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:57,251
your list of doomed men.

368
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:01,388
I'm almost done.

369
00:24:01,423 --> 00:24:03,557
Only one name left.

370
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:06,310
Go on.

371
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:16,187
The Hound.

372
00:24:23,245 --> 00:24:24,495
Thank you.

373
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:26,580
Your mother always had a
sweet tooth, you know?

374
00:24:26,615 --> 00:24:28,165
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

375
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,401
At suppertime, she would go
straight for honey cakes,

376
00:24:31,419 --> 00:24:33,087
candied almonds,
custard.

377
00:24:33,121 --> 00:24:34,788
Anything sweet.

378
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,373
Eventually,
your grandfather

379
00:24:36,407 --> 00:24:38,959
had to assign a septa
to watch her at meals.

380
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,578
Cat was the firstborn
daughter after all.

381
00:24:41,596 --> 00:24:43,547
It was important
that she remain desirable

382
00:24:43,598 --> 00:24:45,249
so Father could arrange
a good match for her

383
00:24:45,267 --> 00:24:47,935
and she was starting
to get fat.

384
00:24:47,969 --> 00:24:51,388
My mother fat?

385
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:55,609
She never let me
have my pudding

386
00:24:55,644 --> 00:24:57,427
until I'd finished
all my proper food.

387
00:24:57,445 --> 00:25:00,814
This is before she married your
father and moved to the North.

388
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:04,451
By the time you were born, your
father's austerity had become hers.

389
00:25:04,486 --> 00:25:07,538
Marriage changes people.

390
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:12,276
I didn't mean
for you to stop.

391
00:25:12,294 --> 00:25:14,078
Go on, enjoy them.

392
00:25:18,133 --> 00:25:20,251
How do you like them?

393
00:25:20,302 --> 00:25:22,303
They're delicious.

394
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:27,675
Where did you get the lemons?
You can't grow them up here.

395
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:29,343
Oh, gods, no.

396
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:32,513
Petyr had three crates brought
all the way from King's Landing.

397
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:34,464
He knew you liked
lemon cakes.

398
00:25:34,482 --> 00:25:36,267
He's so kind.

399
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:38,302
He really
cares for you.

400
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,238
Think where you'd
be without him.

401
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:43,607
In their clutches
and tried for murder.

402
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:47,661
Yes.
I'm very lucky.

403
00:25:47,696 --> 00:25:49,313
He feels
responsible for you.

404
00:25:49,331 --> 00:25:50,915
Oh, I know he does.
I'm so grateful.

405
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:52,816
Why?

406
00:25:52,834 --> 00:25:55,619
Why does he feel
responsible for you?

407
00:25:56,671 --> 00:25:58,539
Well, I'm half Tully.

408
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:01,158
- He loved your family so much.
- Loved your mother.

409
00:26:01,176 --> 00:26:03,127
- No. - That's what
you wanted to say.

410
00:26:03,178 --> 00:26:04,595
He loves you, Aunt Lysa.
He's married to you.

411
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:06,714
Your mother never
loved him. Never.

412
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:09,683
Cat always went straight
for the sweetest thing.

413
00:26:09,718 --> 00:26:12,770
The most obvious thing.
Your Uncle Brandon.

414
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:15,773
Your handsome, arrogant,
cruel Uncle Brandon.

415
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:18,342
He almost killed Petyr
in a duel.

416
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,561
And your mother
loved him anyway.

417
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:24,231
And now Petyr is risking
his life to save you,

418
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:26,984
the daughter of a woman
who didn't love him

419
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:30,037
no more than those
whores in his brothels.

420
00:26:30,071 --> 00:26:33,023
- Has he told you about them?
- No.

421
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:35,859
He hasn't told you about the vile
things they do with their bodies?

422
00:26:35,877 --> 00:26:38,045
The vile things they let
him do with their bodies?

423
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:40,297
<i>- No, never.
- Are you pregnant?</i>

424
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:44,718
What? No, I told you.
Lord Tyrion and I never--

425
00:26:44,753 --> 00:26:46,637
I wasn't asking
about Tyrion.

426
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:48,722
What have you let Petyr
do with your body?

427
00:26:48,757 --> 00:26:51,308
- Aunt Lysa, no, I--
- Your young, pretty body.

428
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:54,011
- Nothing. I'm a virgin.
- Don't lie to me.

429
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:57,348
You're hurting me.

430
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:58,882
I'll know if you lie.

431
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,685
I'm a virgin,
I swear it.

432
00:27:01,736 --> 00:27:03,520
He loves you, Aunt Lysa.

433
00:27:03,554 --> 00:27:05,555
All he says
is that I'm stupid.

434
00:27:05,573 --> 00:27:07,557
I'm a stupid little girl
with stupid dreams

435
00:27:07,575 --> 00:27:09,443
who never learns
and I'm a terrible liar,

436
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:10,778
so I should always
tell the truth.

437
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:13,080
And I swear to you that
he has never touched me.

438
00:27:13,114 --> 00:27:15,582
- Not once, not ever.
- Shh. Shh. Shh.

439
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:19,236
It's all right.

440
00:27:19,254 --> 00:27:21,372
It will all
be all right.

441
00:27:21,424 --> 00:27:22,706
You'll be a widow soon.

442
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,125
They'll execute that dwarf
for murdering the king

443
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:27,378
and you'll be free
to marry Robin.

444
00:27:27,429 --> 00:27:29,546
You'll be the Lady
of the Vale.

445
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,965
Hmm.

446
00:27:53,955 --> 00:27:56,273
Didn't they teach you
how to ride a horse?

447
00:27:56,291 --> 00:27:59,793
Yes, my lady,
when I was young.

448
00:27:59,828 --> 00:28:01,829
There wasn't much call for
it with Lord Tyrion, though.

449
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,465
He preferred litters.

450
00:28:04,499 --> 00:28:07,217
Perhaps you should
have stayed with him.

451
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:15,509
It's not going to be
a pleasant journey for you.

452
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,979
It could take weeks to get to the
Wall, depending on the weather.

453
00:28:19,013 --> 00:28:20,681
That's a long way off.

454
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:23,684
Well, Lady Sansa's
brother's at Castle Black.

455
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:26,303
If I were her,
that's where I'd go.

456
00:28:26,321 --> 00:28:28,856
Feel free to stop
at any point.

457
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:31,808
Never, my lady.
I'm your squire.

458
00:28:31,826 --> 00:28:34,361
I've made it this far in
the world without a squire.

459
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:35,829
I don't see why
I need one now.

460
00:28:35,864 --> 00:28:37,614
All knights have
squires, my lady.

461
00:28:37,648 --> 00:28:38,982
<i>I'm not a knight.</i>

462
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,152
And I'm not a slaver, either.
I don't own you.

463
00:28:42,203 --> 00:28:44,288
I swore an oath,
my lady.

464
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:46,840
I am releasing you
from that oath.

465
00:28:49,878 --> 00:28:52,096
That means
you could leave.

466
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,881
I know.

467
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:56,433
What do you think
will happen if you leave?

468
00:28:57,635 --> 00:29:00,304
They'll say I wasn't
a very good squire.

469
00:29:54,892 --> 00:29:58,162
- The hell you doing?
- Practicing.

470
00:29:58,196 --> 00:30:01,415
- What, ways to die?
- No one's going to kill me.

471
00:30:01,449 --> 00:30:03,400
They will if you nance
around like that.

472
00:30:03,418 --> 00:30:05,902
That's no way to fight.

473
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,872
It's not fighting.
It's water dancing.

474
00:30:08,923 --> 00:30:11,008
Dancing?

475
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:13,260
Maybe you ought
to put on a dress.

476
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:17,080
Who taught you
that shite?

477
00:30:17,098 --> 00:30:19,683
The greatest swordsman
who ever lived.

478
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:25,589
Syrio Forel, the First Sword
to the Sealord of Braavos.

479
00:30:25,607 --> 00:30:27,024
Braavos.

480
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:28,892
Greasy-haired little
bastard, I bet.

481
00:30:28,926 --> 00:30:30,277
They all are.

482
00:30:30,311 --> 00:30:31,895
What do you know
about anything?

483
00:30:31,929 --> 00:30:34,097
I bet his hair is greasier
than Joffrey's cunt.

484
00:30:34,115 --> 00:30:36,116
- It was not.
- Was? He dead?

485
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,100
- Yes.
- How?

486
00:30:37,118 --> 00:30:38,986
- He was killed.
- Who by?

487
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:40,821
Meryn Trant.
That's why Ser Meryn--

488
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:42,606
Meryn Trant?

489
00:30:42,624 --> 00:30:45,792
The greatest swordsman who ever lived
killed by Meryn fucking Trant?

490
00:30:45,827 --> 00:30:47,794
- He was outnumbered.
- Any boy whore with a sword

491
00:30:47,829 --> 00:30:49,746
could beat three
Meryn Trants.

492
00:30:49,798 --> 00:30:52,216
Syrio didn't have a sword.
Or armor. Just a stick.

493
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,418
The greatest swordsman who ever
lived didn't have a sword?

494
00:30:56,954 --> 00:30:58,755
All right.
You have a sword.

495
00:30:58,789 --> 00:31:00,224
Let's see
what he taught you.

496
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:03,093
Go on, do it for
your Braavosi friend.

497
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:06,346
Dead like all the rest
of your friends.

498
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:21,111
Your friend's dead
and Meryn Trant's not

499
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:22,863
'cause Trant had armor

500
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:25,249
and a big fucking sword.

501
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:57,397
Your Grace.

502
00:31:57,448 --> 00:32:00,117
Prince Oberyn.
Writing letters?

503
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:02,903
A poem, actually.

504
00:32:04,188 --> 00:32:06,189
May I show you
the gardens?

505
00:32:06,207 --> 00:32:09,293
I couldn't very well
refuse a royal escort.

506
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:11,495
No, you couldn't.

507
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:15,999
I didn't realize
you were a poet.

508
00:32:16,033 --> 00:32:18,669
Not a very good one.

509
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:20,754
For your paramour?

510
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:23,140
For one of my daughters.

511
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:25,592
You have several,
don't you?

512
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:26,977
Eight.

513
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:28,712
Eight?

514
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:30,981
Eight daughters?

515
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:32,849
The fifth is difficult.

516
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,519
I named her after
my sister Elia.

517
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:37,187
Beautiful name.

518
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:39,106
Yes.

519
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:42,225
But I can't say it
without turning sad.

520
00:32:42,243 --> 00:32:45,162
And after I turn sad,

521
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:47,364
I grow angry.

522
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:50,117
Perhaps that's why
she's difficult.

523
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:53,253
The gods love their
stupid jokes, don't they?

524
00:32:53,287 --> 00:32:55,572
Which joke is that?

525
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:57,958
You're a prince of Dorne.

526
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:00,210
A legendary fighter.

527
00:33:00,262 --> 00:33:02,429
A brilliant man feared
throughout Westeros.

528
00:33:02,463 --> 00:33:05,415
But you could not
save your sister.

529
00:33:05,434 --> 00:33:08,852
I'm a Lannister.
Queen for 19 years.

530
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:11,021
Daughter of the most
powerful man alive.

531
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:13,724
But I could not
save my son.

532
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:16,193
What good is power

533
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:19,229
if you cannot protect
the ones you love?

534
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:21,064
We can avenge them.

535
00:33:21,098 --> 00:33:23,567
Yes, we can avenge them.

536
00:33:25,286 --> 00:33:27,788
You really believe
Tyrion murdered your son?

537
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,041
I know he did.

538
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:35,529
We will have a trial and
we will learn the truth.

539
00:33:35,563 --> 00:33:37,914
We'll have a trial,
anyway.

540
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:45,589
I haven't seen my
daughter in over a year.

541
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:47,591
The last time I saw her,

542
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:50,927
she was swimming with two of
my girls in the Water Gardens.

543
00:33:50,961 --> 00:33:53,764
Laughing in the sun.

544
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,768
I want to believe that.

545
00:33:57,802 --> 00:34:00,637
I want to believe
she's happy.

546
00:34:00,655 --> 00:34:03,240
You have my word.

547
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:06,109
We don't hurt
little girls in Dorne.

548
00:34:07,528 --> 00:34:10,580
Everywhere in the world,
they hurt little girls.

549
00:34:19,957 --> 00:34:21,758
Would you bring her
a gift for me?

550
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:25,429
<i>I wasn't there
for her name day.</i>

551
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:27,798
I don't know when
I'll see her again.

552
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:30,267
Anything at all.

553
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:33,553
The best shipwrights
in King's Landing

554
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:35,722
have been working
on it for months.

555
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:39,192
Myrcella loves
the open water.

556
00:34:39,227 --> 00:34:43,363
<i>I will have it sailed
down to Sunspear for her.</i>

557
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:46,750
Please tell her...

558
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:51,488
her mother misses her
very much.

559
00:35:00,581 --> 00:35:02,966
Oh, no, no, no.

560
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,918
No, no, no, no.

561
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:07,387
Hells.

562
00:35:10,758 --> 00:35:12,559
Gods.

563
00:35:15,563 --> 00:35:17,514
Did you remove the skin?

564
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,151
No, my lady.

565
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:23,153
Have you ever cooked
a rabbit before?

566
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:25,555
No, my lady.

567
00:35:25,573 --> 00:35:29,359
Did you ever cook
anything for Lord Tyrion?

568
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:32,329
No, my lady.

569
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:34,080
That was the cooks.

570
00:35:51,465 --> 00:35:52,799
What are you doing?

571
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:55,084
I'm helping you
with your armor.

572
00:35:55,102 --> 00:35:58,355
I've been removing my own armor for
quite some time, thank you very much.

573
00:36:16,157 --> 00:36:18,792
What exactly did you do
for Lord Tyrion?

574
00:36:18,826 --> 00:36:22,379
I brought him his meals and cleared
his table when he was finished.

575
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:24,714
I kept his clothing
and linens clean.

576
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:27,667
Carried his messages
and returned the replies.

577
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:31,171
Mostly I poured wine.

578
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:33,223
Oh.

579
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:35,124
Whilst in
Lord Tyrion's service,

580
00:36:35,142 --> 00:36:38,511
did you ever do anything
remotely related to combat?

581
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,068
I killed a man.

582
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:50,273
Who?

583
00:36:50,307 --> 00:36:52,325
A Kingsguard.

584
00:36:56,197 --> 00:36:59,616
He tried to kill
Lord Tyrion at the Blackwater.

585
00:37:03,004 --> 00:37:05,455
How did you
kill a Kingsguard?

586
00:37:07,324 --> 00:37:10,010
I pushed a spear through
the back of his head.

587
00:37:21,856 --> 00:37:23,974
Bloody ridiculous.

588
00:37:27,561 --> 00:37:29,312
Help me with
these straps.

589
00:37:48,549 --> 00:37:50,300
Hey.

590
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:52,335
Hey, get up.

591
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:56,306
Get up.

592
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:04,213
<i>That's it lad,
put it inside.</i>

593
00:38:04,231 --> 00:38:06,215
<i>Get the fire going again.
We're all freezing.</i>

594
00:38:06,233 --> 00:38:08,685
Aye. What we need
is a girl there.

595
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:10,854
I've got to
have a piss.

596
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:25,752
Now keep quiet.

597
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:08,578
You need water.

598
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:10,296
It doesn't matter.

599
00:39:10,331 --> 00:39:13,350
Of course it matters.

600
00:39:16,286 --> 00:39:18,621
You mustn't let
anything stop you.

601
00:39:20,641 --> 00:39:23,259
They already have
stopped me.

602
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:25,895
No.

603
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:30,467
You're not here.

604
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,441
You're far from here.

605
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,612
What does that mean?

606
00:39:48,669 --> 00:39:50,703
At the hill.

607
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:53,373
A great weirwood tree.

608
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:58,344
You've seen it, too.

609
00:39:58,379 --> 00:40:02,599
Meera and I,
even Hodor,

610
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:05,268
we're only here
to guide you.

611
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:10,840
He's waiting for you.

612
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:14,944
We have to find it.

613
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,615
You have to make it.

614
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:20,250
We will.

615
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:24,771
This-- this isn't
the end.

616
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,057
Not for you.

617
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,910
Not yet.

618
00:40:30,961 --> 00:40:33,430
<i>How...</i>

619
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:36,166
will we know
the end?

620
00:40:48,062 --> 00:40:50,313
You'll know.

621
00:41:02,776 --> 00:41:05,245
<i>Brothers.</i>

622
00:41:05,279 --> 00:41:07,997
You do move quiet.

623
00:41:10,117 --> 00:41:12,368
- How many?
- 11 men.

624
00:41:12,402 --> 00:41:14,254
Most of them
already drunk.

625
00:41:14,288 --> 00:41:18,174
No guards posted. They don't seem
to have a care in the world.

626
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:21,211
We'll carve them up
like walnut pie.

627
00:41:21,262 --> 00:41:23,746
Karl was a top paid
cutthroat in Flea Bottom.

628
00:41:23,764 --> 00:41:26,015
I've seen what
he can do with a knife.

629
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:27,800
Have you seen what
I can do with a knife?

630
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:30,353
Not yet.

631
00:41:32,439 --> 00:41:36,059
There's a hut on the west side of the keep.
We should steer clear of it.

632
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:37,277
Why?

633
00:41:37,311 --> 00:41:40,429
They've got some hounds
chained up inside.

634
00:41:40,447 --> 00:41:43,566
Closer we can get without the
dogs sniffing us, the better.

635
00:41:45,102 --> 00:41:47,403
New moon tonight.

636
00:41:49,439 --> 00:41:51,774
Get some rest.

637
00:41:51,792 --> 00:41:54,410
We move at sundown.

638
00:41:56,446 --> 00:41:58,715
I've always liked
a girl with curls.

639
00:41:58,749 --> 00:42:00,884
A touch of class.

640
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:03,419
You take
whatever's left.

641
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:08,007
Get her up.

642
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:11,394
<i>Stop.</i>

643
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:13,062
<i>Stop.
What are you doing?</i>

644
00:42:13,097 --> 00:42:15,315
<i>Hodor. Hodor. Hodor.</i>

645
00:42:15,349 --> 00:42:18,151
Stop.
Stop!

646
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:22,572
<i>- Hodor. Hodor.
- Stop!</i>

647
00:42:22,606 --> 00:42:25,158
<i>- Please.
- Hodor.</i>

648
00:42:25,192 --> 00:42:28,444
- Please, get off her!
- Hodor. Hodor.

649
00:42:28,478 --> 00:42:30,780
Please!
Please, leave her alone!

650
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:35,752
<i>Please, stop. Stop.</i>

651
00:42:35,786 --> 00:42:39,038
<i>- What are you doing? Leave her alone!
- Hodor. Hodor.</i>

652
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:40,590
<i>- No!
- Shh.</i>

653
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:43,659
Shh, shh, shh.

654
00:42:43,677 --> 00:42:46,462
Shh.

655
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,468
You've got pretty hair,
don't you?

656
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:57,473
Now what is a pretty little
highborn girl like you

657
00:42:57,507 --> 00:43:00,443
doing out here in
the deep, dark woods, eh?

658
00:43:02,112 --> 00:43:05,865
You left your daddy's castle
looking for trouble, didn't you?

659
00:43:05,899 --> 00:43:08,151
No dresses for you.

660
00:43:09,203 --> 00:43:11,654
You like it rough,
don't you?

661
00:43:11,688 --> 00:43:15,024
You like it in
the gutter, don't you?

662
00:43:15,042 --> 00:43:18,378
If you let my sister go,
I can help you.

663
00:43:19,663 --> 00:43:21,748
You can help me?

664
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:24,167
I can.

665
00:43:25,502 --> 00:43:27,837
And how you
gonna do that?

666
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:34,427
I have the sight.
I can see things.

667
00:43:34,478 --> 00:43:36,379
That's very helpful.

668
00:43:36,397 --> 00:43:38,598
Things that haven't
happened yet.

669
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:44,487
What a fine thing.

670
00:43:48,058 --> 00:43:49,409
A fine thing.

671
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:54,247
Have you seen what I'm
gonna do to your sister?

672
00:43:56,834 --> 00:44:00,803
Have you seen what they're
going to do to your sister?

673
00:44:02,873 --> 00:44:05,008
No.

674
00:44:06,927 --> 00:44:09,629
Don't close your eyes.

675
00:44:14,601 --> 00:44:17,553
I saw you die tonight.

676
00:44:19,523 --> 00:44:21,924
I saw your body burn.

677
00:44:21,942 --> 00:44:26,396
I saw the snow fall
and bury your bones.

678
00:44:29,483 --> 00:44:31,818
<i>To arms!</i>

679
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:34,937
They're here,
the Night's Watch.

680
00:45:04,184 --> 00:45:06,436
Rescue party
is here, lads.

681
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:07,987
Lady.

682
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:10,656
- Is Jon with you?
- Aye.

683
00:45:10,691 --> 00:45:13,326
I'll take you to him.

684
00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:18,414
You're Brandon Stark?

685
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,171
Hodor. Hodor.

686
00:45:25,205 --> 00:45:27,874
The little crippled lord.
We're going for a ride, boy.

687
00:45:27,925 --> 00:45:29,709
Jon! Jon!

688
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:34,130
Keep talking and I'll cut
your friends' throats.

689
00:45:34,181 --> 00:45:37,049
Starting with the idiot.
Do you hear?

690
00:45:37,101 --> 00:45:39,218
Do you hear?

691
00:45:51,681 --> 00:45:53,866
<i>Hodor! Hodor!</i>

692
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:57,703
Hodor. Hodor.

693
00:45:57,738 --> 00:45:59,489
Hodor. Hodor.

694
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:04,710
<i>Hodor. Hodor.
Hodor.</i>

695
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:49,539
Hodor.

696
00:46:50,707 --> 00:46:54,260
<i>Hodor, get his knife.
Cut me loose.</i>

697
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:58,464
<i>- Hodor, get his knife.
- Hodor.</i>

698
00:47:00,133 --> 00:47:02,018
Cut me loose, Hodor.

699
00:47:07,975 --> 00:47:11,143
Jojen and Meera,
free them.

700
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:12,895
<i>Go!</i>

701
00:47:15,649 --> 00:47:17,366
Jon.

702
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:29,078
Jon!

703
00:47:31,164 --> 00:47:32,748
If he sees you, he won't
let you go north.

704
00:47:32,782 --> 00:47:35,801
- He's my brother.
- And wants to protect you.

705
00:47:35,836 --> 00:47:38,671
<i>He'll take you back
to Castle Black.</i>

706
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:42,308
<i>You have to decide.</i>

707
00:47:42,342 --> 00:47:44,343
Do you want to find
the three-eyed raven?

708
00:47:58,609 --> 00:48:00,660
- Hodor.
- Hodor.

709
00:48:00,694 --> 00:48:02,912
We need to free Summer.

710
00:48:02,946 --> 00:48:05,581
And we need to go.

711
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:22,131
Lord Snow.

712
00:48:22,165 --> 00:48:24,717
Are you bringing me
back for trial?

713
00:48:27,304 --> 00:48:29,505
We had
a good thing here.

714
00:48:29,523 --> 00:48:32,391
We were free men.

715
00:48:32,442 --> 00:48:34,560
You'll never be free.

716
00:48:34,611 --> 00:48:36,979
You'll never know
what that's like.

717
00:48:58,135 --> 00:49:01,003
You learn how to fight
in a castle?

718
00:49:06,376 --> 00:49:08,311
Some old man
teach you how to stand,

719
00:49:08,345 --> 00:49:09,712
how to parry?

720
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:15,935
How to fight
with honor?

721
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:30,833
You know what's
wrong with honor?

722
00:49:41,511 --> 00:49:43,346
You.

723
00:50:14,745 --> 00:50:17,296
Are you all right?

724
00:50:19,666 --> 00:50:21,834
Come with me.

725
00:50:21,885 --> 00:50:24,003
Come on.

726
00:50:40,687 --> 00:50:42,905
We lost
four brothers?

727
00:50:42,939 --> 00:50:44,940
Five.

728
00:50:48,412 --> 00:50:50,746
What the seven hells
could do that to a man?

729
00:50:52,999 --> 00:50:55,201
I count 10
dead mutineers.

730
00:50:55,252 --> 00:50:58,454
Locke said there
were 11 of them.

731
00:50:59,873 --> 00:51:01,373
Where's Rast?

732
00:51:45,802 --> 00:51:48,003
- Here's another.
- Jon.

733
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,975
<i>Where in seven hells?</i>

734
00:51:54,177 --> 00:51:55,511
Come here.

735
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:05,070
I missed you, boy.

736
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:10,860
What should we do
with this lot?

737
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:18,033
It's not safe for you
here on your own.

738
00:52:18,067 --> 00:52:20,669
Mance Rayder has an army
heading this way

739
00:52:20,704 --> 00:52:22,705
and there's worse out
there than Mance.

740
00:52:25,125 --> 00:52:27,710
Come with us
to Castle Black.

741
00:52:27,744 --> 00:52:31,130
We can find you work.
Keep you safe.

742
00:52:31,181 --> 00:52:33,415
Meaning all respect,
Ser Crow,

743
00:52:33,433 --> 00:52:37,019
Craster beat us
and worse.

744
00:52:37,053 --> 00:52:40,523
Your brother crows
beat us and worse.

745
00:52:40,557 --> 00:52:42,725
We'll find our own way.

746
00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:44,310
You want to stay here

747
00:52:44,361 --> 00:52:46,478
in Craster's Keep?

748
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:52,651
Burn it to the ground

749
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:55,571
and all the dead with it.
