1
00:00:00,301 --> 00:00:02,655
Do you know what it takes
to unite 90 clans

2
00:00:02,934 --> 00:00:05,091
I told them we were
all going to die

3
00:00:05,344 --> 00:00:06,745
if we don't get south

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,238
Because that's the truth

5
00:00:08,411 --> 00:00:09,684
You swore some vows

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,408
I want you to break 'em

7
00:00:11,486 --> 00:00:12,736
Let's not go back

8
00:00:12,786 --> 00:00:15,138
I don't ever want to leave
this cave, Jon Snow

9
00:00:15,647 --> 00:00:17,313
Your secret's safe with me

10
00:00:17,382 --> 00:00:18,061
What secret?

11
00:00:18,104 --> 00:00:19,726
You didn't stop being a crow

12
00:00:19,747 --> 00:00:21,992
the day you walked
into Mance Rayder's tent

13
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:23,677
I'm your woman now

14
00:00:23,707 --> 00:00:26,507
You're going to be loyal
to your woman

15
00:00:26,834 --> 00:00:28,454
You know
I didn't have a choice

16
00:00:28,506 --> 00:00:30,163
You know nothing, Jon Snow

17
00:00:39,513 --> 00:00:40,543
Those your parents?

18
00:00:40,992 --> 00:00:43,568
I'm going to eat
your dead mama

19
00:00:43,624 --> 00:00:46,356
and I'm going to eat
your dead papa

20
00:00:46,609 --> 00:00:49,718
Go tell the crows
at Castle Black

21
00:00:50,152 --> 00:00:51,877
I should never
have taken her away

22
00:00:52,226 --> 00:00:54,150
You told us there were
wildlings south of the Wall

23
00:00:54,168 --> 00:00:56,550
<i>If they're raiding the smaller
villages, Mole's Town could be next</i></i>

24
00:00:59,562 --> 00:01:01,428
She's dead
And little Sam

25
00:01:01,464 --> 00:01:03,274
As if I cut
their throats myself

26
00:01:08,261 --> 00:01:10,413
Have you ever been
beyond the Wall, ser?

27
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,554
I commanded the City Watch
of King's Landing

28
00:01:12,579 --> 00:01:14,003
You must not have been
very good at your job

29
00:01:14,193 --> 00:01:15,290
How dare you?!

30
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,560
We need to prepare

31
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,078
Lord Snow here recommends
sealing the tunnel

32
00:01:19,102 --> 00:01:21,554
leaving us unable
to carry out our duties

33
00:01:21,605 --> 00:01:23,059
Have you ever seen
a giant?

34
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,474
The tunnel's gate
won't stop them

35
00:01:24,488 --> 00:01:27,282
We can't defend the gate
against 100,000 men

36
00:01:27,697 --> 00:01:28,947
Mance Rayder is coming

37
00:01:29,044 --> 00:01:30,804
If the wildlings
breach the Wall

38
00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:33,710
they'll roll over everything
and everyone for 1,000 miles

39
00:01:33,852 --> 00:01:34,894
Climb the Wall

40
00:01:34,991 --> 00:01:36,175
hit them in the night

41
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:39,224
When it's time, I'm going
to light the biggest fire

42
00:01:39,242 --> 00:01:40,463
the North has ever seen

43
00:04:09,732 --> 00:04:11,984
What was she like?

44
00:04:14,404 --> 00:04:16,321
She...

45
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:20,626
she had red hair.

46
00:04:22,245 --> 00:04:24,296
Oh?

47
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,748
- How big were her feet?
- What do you want me to say?

48
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:30,135
I want you to tell me what
it was like to have someone.

49
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:32,137
To be with someone.

50
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:33,972
To love someone and have
them love you back.

51
00:04:38,061 --> 00:04:41,396
We're all gonna die a lot
sooner than I'd planned.

52
00:04:41,431 --> 00:04:45,067
You're the closest
I'll ever get to knowing.

53
00:04:48,604 --> 00:04:50,221
So you and Gilly never?

54
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:51,556
No.

55
00:04:51,574 --> 00:04:53,859
She just had a baby.

56
00:04:56,579 --> 00:04:58,063
And she never offered.

57
00:04:58,081 --> 00:05:00,532
But if she had,

58
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:03,234
you would have?

59
00:05:03,252 --> 00:05:06,038
You'd have broken
your vows?

60
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:12,044
The interesting
thing is,

61
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:15,130
our vows never
specifically forbid

62
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:17,182
intimate relations
with women.

63
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:18,850
What?

64
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:22,304
"I shall take no wife," yes, that's
in there. There's no denying that.

65
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:24,773
"I shall father no children."
It's very specific.

66
00:05:24,807 --> 00:05:27,592
But what do our vows
have to say about other...

67
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:30,779
activities is open
to interpretation.

68
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:36,234
I don't think Ser Alliser
cares much for interpretation.

69
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:43,742
Anyway, there's nothing
for him to interpret.

70
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:45,744
We didn't.

71
00:05:49,165 --> 00:05:51,133
So what's it like?

72
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:54,720
It's...

73
00:05:56,005 --> 00:05:59,758
there's this person,
this whole other person.

74
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:03,178
And you're wrapped up in them
and they're wrapped up in you.

75
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:05,397
And you--

76
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:07,432
for a little--

77
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:09,768
for a little while,
you're more than just you.

78
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:13,071
You're-- I don't know.
I'm not a bleeding poet.

79
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:14,990
No, you're really not.

80
00:06:15,024 --> 00:06:16,908
What did I get for it?

81
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:19,861
An arrow six inches
from my heart.

82
00:06:21,364 --> 00:06:23,982
There'll be arrows for all
of us soon, I imagine.

83
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,617
There will.

84
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:28,954
They've already done the worst
thing to me they could ever do.

85
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,825
Go get some sleep, Sam.

86
00:06:33,843 --> 00:06:36,094
I'll take this watch.

87
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:21,723
Did I ever
tell you about her?

88
00:07:21,757 --> 00:07:24,843
- My Sheila?
- Yes.

89
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:27,212
That was a night
to remember.

90
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:30,682
Of course, I'd had
a good bit to drink.

91
00:07:32,435 --> 00:07:33,902
Her fangs were sharp,

92
00:07:33,936 --> 00:07:36,154
but she knew
how to use them.

93
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:39,941
And she was nice
and soft down below.

94
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:42,577
No, she was no
ordinary beast.

95
00:07:42,612 --> 00:07:44,496
Many is the man who--

96
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,615
I know you never
fucked a bear.

97
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,417
You know you never
fucked a bear.

98
00:07:49,452 --> 00:07:52,737
Right now I don't want to think
about the bear you never fucked.

99
00:07:52,755 --> 00:07:55,874
Right now all I want
to think about

100
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:58,677
is each one of these arrows finding
its way into a crow's heart.

101
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:02,264
We could be waiting
here a while.

102
00:08:02,298 --> 00:08:03,632
Good.

103
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,684
The longer we wait,
the more arrows I'll have.

104
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:13,275
They came up here
to our land

105
00:08:13,309 --> 00:08:15,861
and put up a big wall
and said it was theirs.

106
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:18,280
Then they started
hunting us down.

107
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:23,618
This time, we're the ones
doing the hunting.

108
00:08:25,321 --> 00:08:28,123
You've got a lot
to say about killing.

109
00:08:28,157 --> 00:08:30,242
Even more words
than arrows.

110
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:34,779
Back in those villages, I killed
just as many of them as you did.

111
00:08:34,797 --> 00:08:36,798
More, I reckon.

112
00:08:36,832 --> 00:08:40,919
Yes, but none of those
were your crow lover.

113
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:42,721
I probably killed
him already.

114
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:44,172
<i>So you've said.</i>

115
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:46,391
And if not,

116
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:50,095
the only thing left of him is gonna be
his fun bits hanging around my neck.

117
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:51,963
<i>More words.</i>

118
00:08:51,981 --> 00:08:54,316
Know what I think
you do when you see him?

119
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:58,186
Serve him up a nice juicy
slice of ginger minge.

120
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:04,576
You been thinking
about that ginger minge?

121
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:08,446
Wondering what
it tastes like?

122
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,418
Maybe I have.

123
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:15,954
Jon Snow is mine.

124
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,874
Anyone else
tries to kill him,

125
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:22,677
I'll have
an arrow for them.

126
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:29,134
And not one of your bald friends
is fast enough to stop me.

127
00:09:50,239 --> 00:09:55,126
And what is it that couldn't
wait until morning, Tarly?

128
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:57,295
Maester Aemon.

129
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,864
- How did you know--
- That it was you?

130
00:09:59,882 --> 00:10:02,467
Who else
but Samwell Tarly

131
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:04,386
would be wasting candles

132
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,055
to read in the middle
of the night?

133
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:13,178
- Let me help you.
- Oh, no need.

134
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,564
I know my way
around this library

135
00:10:16,599 --> 00:10:19,184
better than any other
place in Castle Black.

136
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:21,519
Thousands of books

137
00:10:21,553 --> 00:10:23,855
and no eyes to read them.

138
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:27,909
Old age is a wonderful
source of ironies

139
00:10:27,943 --> 00:10:30,111
if nothing else.

140
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:32,664
But you didn't
answer my question.

141
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:34,282
What are you reading?

142
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,701
Maester Faull.

143
00:10:36,735 --> 00:10:39,704
Ah, the wildlings.

144
00:10:39,738 --> 00:10:43,291
I can assure you that
the closest Maester Faull

145
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:46,711
ever got to a wildling
was this very library.

146
00:10:46,745 --> 00:10:49,681
But what he says
about what they do,

147
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:51,182
it's all true.

148
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:54,919
It's exactly what the survivors
of their raids report.

149
00:10:54,937 --> 00:10:59,774
Yes, imagine the stories
wildlings tell about us.

150
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:04,229
Love is the death
of duty.

151
00:11:05,481 --> 00:11:07,982
I told that to your friend
Jon Snow once.

152
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:12,270
He didn't listen
and neither did you.

153
00:11:12,288 --> 00:11:16,274
Which is why you've abandoned
your watch atop the Wall

154
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:20,245
to come here and read
about the terrible things

155
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:24,416
that may have happened
to the girl you love.

156
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,452
I don't love her.

157
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,421
- Yes, you do.
- No.

158
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:31,139
Yes, you do.

159
00:11:31,173 --> 00:11:35,343
Heard it in your voice when
you first brought her to me.

160
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:37,595
I remember how it sounds.

161
00:11:37,646 --> 00:11:39,630
I was in love once.

162
00:11:39,648 --> 00:11:40,932
You were?

163
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:45,270
You can imagine
all manner of horrors

164
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:47,972
befalling that poor
girl and her child.

165
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,742
Is it so difficult
to imagine

166
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:52,660
that an old person
was once,

167
00:11:52,695 --> 00:11:54,863
more or less,
like you?

168
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:57,532
I'm sorry, Maester.

169
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,317
I didn't mean it
like that.

170
00:11:59,335 --> 00:12:03,221
Do you know who I was
before I came here?

171
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:07,292
What I could have been
if I'd only said the word?

172
00:12:08,827 --> 00:12:10,628
Of course you do.

173
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:14,382
I met many girls
when I was Aemon Targaryen.

174
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:18,303
A future king
always does.

175
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:21,940
Some of them
were quite forward

176
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:24,642
in their attempts
to win my affections.

177
00:12:25,844 --> 00:12:28,113
One of them succeeded.

178
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:31,032
I was very young.

179
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:33,685
Who was she?

180
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:35,653
Ah.

181
00:12:35,687 --> 00:12:38,239
I could tell you
everything about her.

182
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,158
Who she was,

183
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:41,960
how we met,

184
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:44,129
the color of her eyes,

185
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:46,898
and the shape
of her nose.

186
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,969
I can see her

187
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:53,838
right in front of me.

188
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:59,260
She's more real
than you are.

189
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:06,717
We could spend all night
trading tales of lost loves.

190
00:13:06,735 --> 00:13:09,554
Nothing makes the past
a sweeter place to visit

191
00:13:09,572 --> 00:13:12,724
than the prospect
of imminent death.

192
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:15,076
Go to bed, Tarly.

193
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,668
<i>Sorry, I can't open the gate
for anybody. Orders.</i>

194
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:25,954
<i>- You don't understand.
- They killed everyone.</i>

195
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,072
<i>Everyone but me
and my baby.</i>

196
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:30,458
<i>They're out there.
I saw them on my way here.</i>

197
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:32,710
<i>They may have seen me. They
may have followed me. Please.</i>

198
00:13:32,761 --> 00:13:34,179
<i>I'm sorry, I can't.</i>

199
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:35,580
<i>If they find us out here,
you don't know...</i>

200
00:13:35,598 --> 00:13:37,415
Pyp!
Open the gate.

201
00:13:37,433 --> 00:13:40,134
- I can't.
- Sam, is that you?

202
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:42,303
Yes.

203
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:44,389
Thorne gave me strict
orders to not open the gate.

204
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:47,025
Oh, Pyp,
open the fucking gate!

205
00:13:48,477 --> 00:13:50,094
I never heard you
curse before.

206
00:13:50,112 --> 00:13:52,197
Yes, well,
best get used to it.

207
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:00,121
Are you all right?

208
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:04,659
Shh, you're all right.

209
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:08,613
Of course you are,
my brave little fella.

210
00:14:08,631 --> 00:14:11,299
- It was horrible.
- I'm so, so sorry.

211
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,134
I didn't know
until I got back.

212
00:14:13,168 --> 00:14:14,636
Don't let them
send me away, Sam.

213
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,554
- Never. - I know there's
no women allowed.

214
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:20,058
Anyone who tries to throw you out
will be having words with me.

215
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:23,094
From now on,
wherever you go,

216
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:25,597
I go, too.

217
00:14:35,691 --> 00:14:37,525
<i>Get ready!</i>

218
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:39,744
<i>- Man the gate!
- Ready yourselves!</i>

219
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:41,829
<i>Make haste!</i>

220
00:14:41,864 --> 00:14:43,981
<i>- Prepare!
- Up on the Wall!</i>

221
00:14:43,999 --> 00:14:45,533
<i>Quickly!
Up! Up!</i>

222
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:48,786
<i>-  How many?
- How many are there?</i>

223
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:52,957
Beyond the trees!

224
00:14:56,828 --> 00:14:58,930
It's time.

225
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:48,596
Light them up!
Light them all!

226
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,024
Move!

227
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:04,028
Pick up the pace!

228
00:16:04,062 --> 00:16:06,080
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

229
00:16:12,755 --> 00:16:15,340
Here we go, boys,
there's one.

230
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:18,543
Let's go.
There's two.

231
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,631
Let's get the next load.

232
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:29,053
That's the last
of the oil, Ser Alliser.

233
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:33,191
100,000 you say?

234
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:35,393
Yes, Ser.

235
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:37,729
You can say it
if you like.

236
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:41,616
We should have sealed the
tunnel while we had the chance,

237
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:45,036
like you suggested.

238
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:48,289
It was a difficult
decision either way, Ser.

239
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:54,111
Do you know what leadership
means, Lord Snow?

240
00:16:54,129 --> 00:16:57,215
It means that the person in
charge gets second-guessed

241
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:59,834
by every clever little
twat with a mouth.

242
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:02,286
But if he starts
second-guessing himself,

243
00:17:02,304 --> 00:17:04,121
that's the end--

244
00:17:04,139 --> 00:17:07,592
for him, for the
clever little twats,

245
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:09,310
for everyone.

246
00:17:09,344 --> 00:17:12,313
This is not the end.
Not for us.

247
00:17:12,347 --> 00:17:14,482
Not if you lot
do your duty

248
00:17:14,516 --> 00:17:17,068
for however long it takes
to beat them back.

249
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,773
And then you get
to go on hating me

250
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,441
and I get
to go on wishing

251
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:25,943
your wildling whore
had finished the job.

252
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:50,768
<i>You'll be safe
down here.</i>

253
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:52,687
I'll check on you
as soon as I can.

254
00:17:52,721 --> 00:17:55,640
You're leaving me again?

255
00:17:56,725 --> 00:17:58,359
I'm not leaving you.

256
00:17:58,393 --> 00:18:01,178
You're going up there and we're
staying down here. That's leaving.

257
00:18:01,196 --> 00:18:03,564
You said from now on
we'd stay together.

258
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:06,617
I didn't mean
in the same room.

259
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:07,985
What are you going
to do out there?

260
00:18:08,019 --> 00:18:09,370
- Help my brothers.
- How?

261
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:13,040
You're going to fight the
free folk when they come?

262
00:18:13,075 --> 00:18:15,910
They'll kill you. In Mole's
Town, they killed everyone.

263
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:19,547
I can't just hide here with you
while they're fighting out there.

264
00:18:19,581 --> 00:18:22,416
Why not? You won't
matter up there.

265
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,085
You will down here.

266
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:28,372
I am a man of
the Night's Watch, Gilly.

267
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:30,675
I made a promise
to defend the Wall

268
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:32,543
and I have to keep it

269
00:18:32,561 --> 00:18:35,146
because that's
what men do.

270
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:50,027
Promise me
you won't die.

271
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:56,200
I promise you
I won't die.

272
00:19:30,118 --> 00:19:33,437
There's a lot more wildlings on the
other side of the Wall than this side.

273
00:19:33,455 --> 00:19:36,574
We've got loads
of weapons and things.

274
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:38,492
It's the perfect place
for us to be.

275
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:40,745
I've never thrown
a spear before.

276
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:43,631
I've never held a sword
with a proper edge.

277
00:19:43,665 --> 00:19:46,334
This is no place
for me to be.

278
00:19:48,286 --> 00:19:49,720
You're not afraid?

279
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:52,223
Of course I'm afraid.

280
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:54,759
There's a band of wildlings
coming to kill us.

281
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:56,227
If you're afraid
of a band of wildlings,

282
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:59,513
how in seven hells did you
manage to kill a white walker?

283
00:20:04,987 --> 00:20:07,655
I didn't know
I was going to kill it.

284
00:20:07,689 --> 00:20:10,441
But I had to do something.
I didn't have any choice.

285
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:12,443
It was going to kill Gilly
and take the baby.

286
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:17,748
If someone had asked
me my name right then,

287
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,450
I wouldn't have known.

288
00:20:21,203 --> 00:20:24,171
I wasn't
Samwell Tarly anymore.

289
00:20:24,206 --> 00:20:26,958
I wasn't a steward
in the Night's Watch

290
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:29,710
or son of Randyll Tarly
or any of that.

291
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:33,047
I was nothing at all.

292
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:36,884
And when you're
nothing at all,

293
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:39,553
there's no more reason
to be afraid.

294
00:20:41,356 --> 00:20:43,357
But you're afraid now?

295
00:20:44,226 --> 00:20:45,860
Yes, well...

296
00:20:47,729 --> 00:20:49,814
I'm not nothing anymore.

297
00:21:09,084 --> 00:21:10,501
Most of their men
are up top.

298
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:13,871
Didn't count more than 20 down here.
Leftovers.

299
00:21:13,889 --> 00:21:15,973
They got a big fat one and a
little bony one manning the front.

300
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:17,508
How high are the walls?

301
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:19,810
Well, we'll be up and over before
they know what's happened.

302
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:24,265
Let's kill some crows!

303
00:21:26,269 --> 00:21:28,653
Come on!

304
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:47,788
<i>Come on, brothers!</i>

305
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:04,582
Archers nock.

306
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:06,817
Everyone else hold.

307
00:23:06,835 --> 00:23:09,286
Grenn, no!

308
00:23:12,207 --> 00:23:15,159
I said nock and hold,
you cunts!

309
00:23:15,177 --> 00:23:18,212
- Does nock mean draw?
- No, Ser!

310
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:21,515
- Does fucking hold mean fucking drop?
- No, Ser!

311
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:24,769
- You all plan to die here tonight?
- No, Ser!

312
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:27,271
That's very good to hear.
Draw!

313
00:23:31,526 --> 00:23:33,561
No, down below!

314
00:23:43,238 --> 00:23:45,706
Draw!
Light them up.

315
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:02,873
Come on, get up!

316
00:24:02,891 --> 00:24:04,725
They're attacking
the southern gate!

317
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:06,894
<i>- Now?
- Now.</i>

318
00:24:10,232 --> 00:24:13,984
I'm going down there. Brother
Slynt, you have the Wall.

319
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:16,553
What?

320
00:24:16,571 --> 00:24:19,773
What are you fucking waiting for?
Loose!

321
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:23,277
You heard the man.
Loose!

322
00:25:00,448 --> 00:25:01,982
You, over there.

323
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:09,039
- Did you get one?
- No.

324
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:12,710
Ah, shit, Pyp!
Shit.

325
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:14,378
- Sam.
- Yeah?

326
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:16,213
- I think
we're gonna die.

327
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:18,249
If you keep
missing, we will.

328
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:30,227
Come on!
Come on!

329
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,600
Brothers!

330
00:25:36,634 --> 00:25:40,187
100 generations
have defended this castle.

331
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:42,990
She's never fallen before.

332
00:25:43,024 --> 00:25:44,474
She will not fall tonight.

333
00:25:44,492 --> 00:25:47,644
Those are Thenns
at our walls.

334
00:25:47,662 --> 00:25:49,980
They eat the flesh
of the men they kill.

335
00:25:49,998 --> 00:25:53,167
Do you want to fill
the belly of a Thenn tonight?

336
00:25:53,201 --> 00:25:54,501
No!

337
00:25:54,536 --> 00:25:56,036
Tonight we fight.

338
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:58,488
<i>And when the sun rises,
I promise you,</i>

339
00:25:58,506 --> 00:26:00,424
Castle Black will stand!

340
00:26:01,543 --> 00:26:03,761
The Night's Watch
will stand.

341
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:10,601
With me now!
Now with me!

342
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:09,276
No discipline.
No training.

343
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:12,112
Gang of thieves,
that's all this is.

344
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:14,915
<i>I commanded the City Watch
of King's Landing.</i>

345
00:27:14,949 --> 00:27:16,834
<i>Those men obeyed orders.</i>

346
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:18,669
We can't just let
them attack the gate!

347
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:22,039
The bars of those gates are four
inches of cold-rolled steel.

348
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:24,541
Those are giants riding
mammoths down there!

349
00:27:24,575 --> 00:27:27,044
Do you think your cold-rolled
steel is gonna stop them?

350
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:28,345
No such thing
as giants.

351
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,048
<i>A story
for the children.</i>

352
00:27:32,967 --> 00:27:34,852
Brother Slynt.

353
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:37,688
We just got word that Ser
Alliser needs you below.

354
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:42,726
You're the most experienced man
he's got, Ser, and he needs you.

355
00:27:43,645 --> 00:27:45,429
Needed below?

356
00:27:45,447 --> 00:27:47,614
Yes. Yes.

357
00:27:56,791 --> 00:28:00,294
Archers, nock your arrows!

358
00:28:00,328 --> 00:28:02,830
<i>Nock arrows!</i>

359
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:04,581
Draw!

360
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:08,218
Loose!

361
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,301
They won't summit
before dawn.

362
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:25,352
How do you know that?

363
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:27,471
Because I've made
that climb.

364
00:28:27,489 --> 00:28:30,607
I think they're in a bigger
hurry than you were.

365
00:28:33,328 --> 00:28:35,195
<i>Hold the bridge!</i>

366
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:37,364
<i>Hold, wait for it!</i>

367
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:40,250
<i>Come on with the rocks!</i>

368
00:28:45,874 --> 00:28:47,341
Nock!

369
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,711
Draw!

370
00:28:54,382 --> 00:28:55,682
Loose!

371
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:16,653
Down!

372
00:29:50,772 --> 00:29:53,273
No! No!

373
00:30:12,293 --> 00:30:13,877
To the gate.
Come on, let's move.

374
00:30:17,932 --> 00:30:19,216
It's gonna open.

375
00:31:23,998 --> 00:31:26,366
I got one right through the heart.
He's dead.

376
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:28,818
- Oh, is it over?
- No.

377
00:31:28,836 --> 00:31:30,704
Well, then...

378
00:31:38,212 --> 00:31:41,298
You're all right.
You're all right.

379
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:45,769
I'll get help.

380
00:31:45,803 --> 00:31:47,521
Shh. Shh.

381
00:31:47,555 --> 00:31:49,856
Maester Aemon is coming.

382
00:31:49,891 --> 00:31:51,841
He's gonna make
it all right.

383
00:31:51,859 --> 00:31:55,145
Shh. Shh.

384
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:05,956
- Now.
- Now!

385
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,751
The outer gate
won't hold.

386
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:43,720
Take five men,
hold the inner gate.

387
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:45,138
Aye.

388
00:33:47,642 --> 00:33:49,476
Hold the gate.

389
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:51,812
If they make it through...

390
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:55,982
They won't.

391
00:33:58,019 --> 00:34:00,687
Come on, Hill.
And you, Cooper.

392
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:03,907
- You three, on me.

393
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:06,243
Come on,
you lazy bastards.

394
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:12,115
Oil.

395
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:15,252
Oil on the ramp!

396
00:34:24,378 --> 00:34:26,630
Protect the gate!

397
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:01,548
Get him inside.

398
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,754
Hold the fucking gate!

399
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:09,923
Hold it!

400
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:09,933
We need more men
down here.

401
00:36:09,952 --> 00:36:12,452
- We have to hold the gate.
- But we need men here.

402
00:36:12,486 --> 00:36:14,771
Tell Jon.
He's in command.

403
00:36:14,789 --> 00:36:17,207
Let's go.

404
00:36:24,832 --> 00:36:28,001
Get me to the top!
You hear me?!

405
00:36:32,506 --> 00:36:34,925
Your name's Olly, right?

406
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:38,178
Listen to me, Olly.
Get me to the top.

407
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:41,231
And when we give the signal,
bring us back down.

408
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,984
You hear me?

409
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:51,241
Find a weapon, Olly.
Fight them.

410
00:37:24,025 --> 00:37:26,176
Clear the way!
Let's go!

411
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:28,311
- Out of the way!
- Get out of here!

412
00:37:45,746 --> 00:37:48,197
Cut the rope!

413
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:56,840
Wait! No!

414
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:12,906
<i>- We need more archers.
- Here I am.</i>

415
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:15,275
<i>- Come on.
- Quickly.</i>

416
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:19,412
What are you
doing up here?

417
00:38:19,447 --> 00:38:21,948
The wildlings
are over the walls.

418
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:23,783
Ser Alliser's fallen.

419
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:26,503
The castle won't stand
much longer.

420
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:31,174
Edd, you have the Wall.

421
00:38:33,427 --> 00:38:35,912
If they try the mammoths
again, drop fire on them.

422
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:38,715
If the climbers get too high,
drop the scythe on them.

423
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:47,423
Come, brothers.
Now fight with me!

424
00:38:47,441 --> 00:38:51,277
Might as well enjoy
our last night, right, boys?

425
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:53,279
Light the fuckers up!

426
00:38:53,314 --> 00:38:56,483
<i>Nock! Draw!</i>

427
00:38:57,434 --> 00:38:59,652
Loose!

428
00:39:08,278 --> 00:39:09,412
How are we
gonna stop that?

429
00:39:09,446 --> 00:39:10,747
Shot 20 arrows
in him already.

430
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:12,215
You heard Jon.
We hold the gate.

431
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:13,666
Jon Snow's not
Lord Commander.

432
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:15,385
We hold the gate!

433
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:26,763
Mother, save me.
Father, save me.

434
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:27,981
The gods aren't down here.

435
00:39:28,015 --> 00:39:29,649
It's the six of us.
You hear me?

436
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:38,307
Night gathers
and now my watch begins.

437
00:39:38,325 --> 00:39:40,744
<i>It shall not end
until my death.</i>

438
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:43,246
I shall take no wife,
hold no lands,

439
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,864
<i>father no children.</i>

440
00:39:44,915 --> 00:39:47,450
I shall wear no crown
and win no glory.

441
00:39:47,484 --> 00:39:49,669
I shall live and die
at my post.

442
00:39:49,703 --> 00:39:51,588
I am the sword
in the darkness.

443
00:39:51,622 --> 00:39:53,423
I am the watcher
on the walls.

444
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:56,459
I am the shield that guards
the realms of men.

445
00:39:56,493 --> 00:40:00,513
I pledge my life and honor
to the Night's Watch

446
00:40:00,548 --> 00:40:03,216
for this night
and all the nights to come!

447
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:10,440
I don't want you
out there.

448
00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:12,692
You can't
protect me forever.

449
00:40:12,726 --> 00:40:15,311
There won't be anywhere
to hide if the castle falls.

450
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:20,700
I need him
more than I need you.

451
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:36,726
We need you, boy.

452
00:41:58,832 --> 00:42:00,550
Ha!

453
00:43:55,616 --> 00:43:57,166
Jon Snow.

454
00:43:57,201 --> 00:44:00,453
Hush.
Don't talk.

455
00:44:04,574 --> 00:44:07,043
Do you remember the cave?

456
00:44:11,465 --> 00:44:14,267
We should have
stayed in the cave.

457
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:20,223
We'll go back there.

458
00:44:26,313 --> 00:44:29,649
You know nothing,
Jon Snow.

459
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:07,320
Drop the scythe, boys!

460
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:31,994
<i>- Hoist her up.
- Hoist her up!</i>

461
00:45:37,885 --> 00:45:40,002
They've had enough
for one night.

462
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:46,476
Don't cheer too loud.

463
00:45:47,861 --> 00:45:50,897
They still outnumber us
1,000 to one.

464
00:45:59,206 --> 00:46:00,957
Tormund.

465
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:03,543
It's over.

466
00:46:03,577 --> 00:46:04,911
Let it end.

467
00:46:04,962 --> 00:46:07,246
This is how a man ends.

468
00:46:15,222 --> 00:46:16,756
Put him in chains.

469
00:46:17,874 --> 00:46:19,675
We'll question him later.

470
00:46:22,396 --> 00:46:24,814
I should have
thrown you

471
00:46:24,848 --> 00:46:27,850
from the top
of the Wall, boy!

472
00:46:27,884 --> 00:46:29,902
Aye.

473
00:46:29,937 --> 00:46:31,988
You should have.

474
00:46:39,112 --> 00:46:41,781
Whoa, it's me.
It's me.

475
00:46:45,619 --> 00:46:47,453
I promised you,
didn't I?

476
00:47:02,436 --> 00:47:04,136
We held them off.

477
00:47:04,188 --> 00:47:06,138
For one night.

478
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:08,524
This is a great
victory.

479
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:10,726
A great victory?

480
00:47:12,279 --> 00:47:14,530
Mance was testing
our defenses.

481
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:16,148
He almost
made it through.

482
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,985
And he has more giants.
He has more mammoths.

483
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:21,737
He has 1,000 times
as many men.

484
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:27,660
They'll hit us
again tonight.

485
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:30,129
Maybe we can hold them
off for a day or two,

486
00:47:30,163 --> 00:47:31,914
but we'll never
beat them.

487
00:47:33,133 --> 00:47:34,500
Where are we going?

488
00:47:34,551 --> 00:47:36,219
Going to find Mance.

489
00:47:36,253 --> 00:47:38,955
To fi---
you can't do that.

490
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:40,840
<i>No one gave you
any orders.</i>

491
00:47:42,593 --> 00:47:44,977
Who's left
to give orders?

492
00:47:45,012 --> 00:47:47,763
The wildling army's only
an army because of Mance.

493
00:47:47,797 --> 00:47:50,516
He united
100 warring tribes.

494
00:47:50,567 --> 00:47:52,602
Without Mance,
they lose their leader.

495
00:47:52,636 --> 00:47:55,321
They lose their purpose. They
go back to fighting each other.

496
00:47:55,355 --> 00:47:57,156
Scatter back
to their homes.

497
00:47:57,190 --> 00:47:59,358
Without Mance?

498
00:47:59,409 --> 00:48:00,826
You're going to kill him?

499
00:48:00,861 --> 00:48:02,161
I'm gonna try.

500
00:48:02,195 --> 00:48:04,030
They'll never let you
within 100 yards of him.

501
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:06,282
And even if they did, even
if you managed to kill him--

502
00:48:06,316 --> 00:48:08,868
They'll kill me? If I don't
go, they'll kill me anyway.

503
00:48:08,919 --> 00:48:10,336
They'll kill
the rest of us, too.

504
00:48:10,370 --> 00:48:12,922
<i>They won't just kill you.</i>

505
00:48:12,956 --> 00:48:14,823
They'll boil you.
They'll flay you.

506
00:48:14,841 --> 00:48:16,342
They'll make it last days.

507
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:22,682
You're right.
It's a bad plan.

508
00:48:24,685 --> 00:48:26,719
What's your plan?

509
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:12,181
They held the gate.

510
00:49:21,408 --> 00:49:23,993
Get some brothers
down here to help you.

511
00:49:26,113 --> 00:49:28,414
We need to burn
the bodies.

512
00:49:49,252 --> 00:49:52,254
Raise the outer gate.

513
00:49:52,272 --> 00:49:54,807
Then lower it again
as soon as I'm out.

514
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:07,737
What are you doing?

515
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:10,456
I promised Mormont
I'd never lose it again.

516
00:50:14,795 --> 00:50:16,962
In case I don't come back.

517
00:50:24,788 --> 00:50:26,806
Jon.

518
00:50:31,478 --> 00:50:33,262
Come back.
