1
00:00:01,412 --> 00:00:02,841
You think I'm gonna escape?

2
00:00:03,207 --> 00:00:04,319
Where would I go?

3
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:06,535
My family's gone.
I've got no one.

4
00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:08,309
You've got an aunt in the Vale.

5
00:00:08,356 --> 00:00:09,782
Your rich Aunt Lysa

6
00:00:10,318 --> 00:00:12,128
He's sitting there
drinking our wine

7
00:00:12,456 --> 00:00:13,696
eating his fill while we die

8
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:17,036
I shall have your head for this

9
00:00:18,566 --> 00:00:20,004
No, we have to go. Now

10
00:00:22,542 --> 00:00:23,516
Mance sent you?

11
00:00:23,667 --> 00:00:25,688
Not like those crows
at Castle Black.

12
00:00:25,786 --> 00:00:27,420
getting nice and fat

13
00:00:27,706 --> 00:00:31,052
you really ought to try crow

14
00:00:31,771 --> 00:00:33,359
Have you ever been
to Meereen?

15
00:00:33,483 --> 00:00:35,227
They say 1,000 slaves died

16
00:00:35,286 --> 00:00:37,093
building the Great
Pyramid of Meereen

17
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:38,688
And now an army
of former slaves

18
00:00:38,784 --> 00:00:40,369
is marching to her gates

19
00:00:40,451 --> 00:00:42,149
You think the Great
Masters are worried?

20
00:00:42,611 --> 00:00:44,504
If they're smart, Your Grace

21
00:00:45,398 --> 00:00:46,134
Not now

22
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:47,562
Not now? When?

23
00:00:47,575 --> 00:00:51,137
You come back after all this time
and expect everything to be the same?

24
00:00:51,297 --> 00:00:51,871
What are you saying?

25
00:00:52,147 --> 00:00:53,764
I'm saying you took too long

26
00:00:53,912 --> 00:00:56,702
My enemies have made
my kingdom bleed

27
00:00:58,164 --> 00:01:00,336
there's power
in king's blood

28
00:01:00,381 --> 00:01:02,145
The usurper Joffrey Baratheon

29
00:01:05,738 --> 00:01:06,745
Why are you doing this?

30
00:01:06,825 --> 00:01:07,869
Because it's right

31
00:01:09,258 --> 00:01:10,100
Serve me my wine

32
00:01:13,287 --> 00:01:13,983
He's choking

33
00:01:14,075 --> 00:01:14,891
Come with me now

34
00:01:15,882 --> 00:01:16,774
we have to leave

35
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:19,747
He poisoned my son

36
00:01:21,012 --> 00:01:21,934
Take him

37
00:03:22,518 --> 00:03:25,404
You did this.
You did this!

38
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:28,690
<i>- We have to leave.
- Take him! Take him!</i>

39
00:03:31,494 --> 00:03:33,445
Where is his wife?

40
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,997
Where's Sansa?

41
00:03:35,031 --> 00:03:37,366
Find her.
Bar the gates of the city.

42
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:40,869
<i>Seize every ship
in the harbor.</i>

43
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,422
- Where is she?!
- No one leaves the capital!

44
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:45,490
<i>No one!</i>

45
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:16,021
- Get in.
- Where are we going?

46
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:17,823
Somewhere safe.

47
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:05,003
Up you go, my lady.

48
00:05:07,256 --> 00:05:09,257
You'll be fine.

49
00:05:09,292 --> 00:05:11,176
You're stronger
than you know.

50
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:31,897
- Lord Baelish?
- Petyr.

51
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:33,982
Are you hurt,
my lady?

52
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,767
Good. Good.

53
00:05:35,785 --> 00:05:38,620
I'm sure you've had quite a fright.
Rest easy.

54
00:05:38,654 --> 00:05:40,605
<i>- The worst is past.
- Lord Baelish.</i>

55
00:05:40,623 --> 00:05:43,208
<i>-  I promised I'd get her to you safely.
- Softly, my friend.</i>

56
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:45,877
Voices carry
over water.

57
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:48,947
I should get back before
someone thinks to look for me.

58
00:05:48,965 --> 00:05:50,966
First you'll want
your pay.

59
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,802
- 10,000 was it?
- 10,000.

60
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,760
Wait!

61
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:05,147
<i>Shh.</i>

62
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:07,065
You don't want the
queen to hear, do you?

63
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,735
1,000 gold cloaks
are searching for you.

64
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:11,636
And if they found you,

65
00:06:11,654 --> 00:06:15,323
how do you think they would punish
the girl who murdered the king?

66
00:06:15,358 --> 00:06:18,710
- I didn't murder anyone.
- I know. I know.

67
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:19,978
But you must admit
it looks suspicious.

68
00:06:19,996 --> 00:06:22,080
The king who
executed your father,

69
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,332
who tormented you
for years,

70
00:06:24,367 --> 00:06:27,119
and you fled the scene
of his murder.

71
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:29,320
Why did you kill him?

72
00:06:29,338 --> 00:06:32,090
Because he was
a drunk and a fool

73
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,960
and I don't trust
drunk fools.

74
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:37,229
He saved me.

75
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:40,215
Saved you? My lady,
he followed my orders.

76
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:44,636
Every one of them.
And he did it all for gold.

77
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,322
<i>Money buys a man's
silence for a time.</i>

78
00:06:47,356 --> 00:06:50,692
A bolt in the heart
buys it forever.

79
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:55,864
He was helping me
because I saved his life.

80
00:06:55,898 --> 00:06:59,985
Yes, and he gave you
a priceless necklace

81
00:07:00,036 --> 00:07:03,121
that once belonged
to his grandmother.

82
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:06,208
The last legacy
of House Hollard.

83
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:17,002
I had it made
a few weeks ago.

84
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:21,256
What did I once tell
you about the capital?

85
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:23,975
We're all liars here.

86
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:27,712
Come, my lady.

87
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:30,381
I know you've had
a difficult day.

88
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:32,517
But you're safe now.

89
00:07:32,551 --> 00:07:34,686
I promise you that.

90
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,888
You're safe with me

91
00:07:36,906 --> 00:07:39,524
and sailing home.

92
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:48,250
So am I the queen?

93
00:07:48,284 --> 00:07:50,068
More than you were
with Renly.

94
00:07:50,086 --> 00:07:53,171
Less than you would have been if
Joffrey had done you the courtesy

95
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:56,124
of consummating
the marriage before dying.

96
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:59,410
In any case, this would
not be an opportune moment

97
00:07:59,428 --> 00:08:01,296
to press the issue.

98
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:03,181
Clawing at his own throat,

99
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:06,084
looking to his mother to make
it stop-- it was horrible.

100
00:08:06,102 --> 00:08:08,603
The world is overflowing
with horrible things.

101
00:08:08,638 --> 00:08:10,889
But they're all a tray
of cakes next to death.

102
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:15,644
They brought me your grandfather's
body when he died, you know?

103
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:17,479
Made me look at it.

104
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,064
What was it like?

105
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:22,267
They took me to the Great
Hall and there he was.

106
00:08:22,285 --> 00:08:24,119
The man I'd married

107
00:08:24,153 --> 00:08:27,405
and suffered to father
my children.

108
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:29,658
A great doughy lump
I'd sat next to

109
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:33,111
at endless dinners
and tedious gatherings.

110
00:08:33,129 --> 00:08:35,714
There he was...

111
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:39,134
lying on a table.

112
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:44,556
One of my husbands
preferred the company of men

113
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,258
and was stabbed
through the heart.

114
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,643
Another was happiest
torturing animals

115
00:08:48,678 --> 00:08:50,929
and was poisoned
at our wedding feast.

116
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:52,931
- I must be cursed.
- Nonsense.

117
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:55,850
Your circumstances
have improved markedly.

118
00:08:57,603 --> 00:09:00,488
You may not have enjoyed
watching him die,

119
00:09:00,523 --> 00:09:02,357
but you enjoyed it more
than you would have enjoyed

120
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:04,359
being married to him,
I can promise you that.

121
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,494
But I would have been
the queen.

122
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:08,413
Our alliance
with the Lannisters

123
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:11,032
remains every bit
as necessary to them

124
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,535
as it is unpleasant
for us.

125
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:16,538
You did wonderful
work on Joffrey.

126
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:19,624
The next one
should be easier.

127
00:09:29,352 --> 00:09:31,269
<i>Your brother is dead.</i>

128
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:35,640
Do you know
what that means?

129
00:09:37,893 --> 00:09:41,279
I'm not trying
to trick you.

130
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:44,449
It means I'll become king.

131
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:46,868
Yes, you will
become king.

132
00:09:46,902 --> 00:09:50,155
What kind of king
do you think you'll be?

133
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,958
A good king?

134
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:55,327
Mm, I think so as well.

135
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:59,881
You've got the right
temperament for it.

136
00:09:59,915 --> 00:10:03,718
<i>But what makes
a good king? Hmm?</i>

137
00:10:03,753 --> 00:10:07,172
What is a good king's single
most important quality?

138
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:09,374
This is hardly
the place or the time.

139
00:10:09,392 --> 00:10:11,343
Holiness?

140
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,544
Hmm.

141
00:10:13,562 --> 00:10:16,881
<i>Baelor the Blessed
was holy.</i>

142
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:19,100
And pious.

143
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:21,736
He built this sept.

144
00:10:21,771 --> 00:10:25,073
He also named a
six-year-old boy high septon

145
00:10:25,107 --> 00:10:28,410
because he thought the boy
could work miracles.

146
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:32,497
He ended up fasting
himself into an early grave

147
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:34,616
because food
was of this world

148
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,868
and this world
was sinful.

149
00:10:39,288 --> 00:10:40,839
Justice.

150
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:42,590
Yeah.

151
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,926
A good king
must be just.

152
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:47,796
Orys I was just.

153
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:51,299
Everyone applauded
his reforms.

154
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,351
Nobles and commoners alike.

155
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:55,520
But he wasn't just for long.

156
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:57,588
He was murdered
in his sleep

157
00:10:57,606 --> 00:10:59,858
after less than a year
by his own brother.

158
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:03,111
Was that truly
just of him?

159
00:11:03,145 --> 00:11:05,397
To abandon his subjects
to an evil

160
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:07,598
that he was too gullible
to recognize?

161
00:11:07,616 --> 00:11:09,951
- No.
- No.

162
00:11:12,321 --> 00:11:15,206
- What about strength?
- Yes.

163
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:17,575
Strength.

164
00:11:17,609 --> 00:11:19,777
King Robert was strong.

165
00:11:19,795 --> 00:11:22,297
He won the rebellion

166
00:11:22,331 --> 00:11:25,950
and crushed
the Targaryen dynasty.

167
00:11:25,968 --> 00:11:28,837
And he attended three
small council meetings

168
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:30,722
in 17 years.

169
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:35,260
<i>He spent his time whoring
and hunting and drinking</i>

170
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:37,762
until the last two
killed him.

171
00:11:39,181 --> 00:11:42,267
<i>So, we have a man who
starves himself to death,</i>

172
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:45,803
a man who lets his own
brother murder him,

173
00:11:45,821 --> 00:11:49,441
and a man who thinks that winning
and ruling are the same thing.

174
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:54,496
What do they all lack?

175
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:00,818
- Wisdom.
- Yes!

176
00:12:00,836 --> 00:12:02,871
Wisdom is what
makes a good king.

177
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:04,506
Yes.

178
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:07,258
But what is wisdom?
Hmm?

179
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:12,130
<i>A house with great wealth
and fertile lands</i>

180
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:13,932
<i>asks you
for your protection</i>

181
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:16,935
against another house
with a strong navy

182
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:19,354
that could one day
oppose you.

183
00:12:19,388 --> 00:12:22,857
How do you know which choice
is wise and which isn't?

184
00:12:22,892 --> 00:12:26,844
You've any experience
of treasuries and granaries

185
00:12:26,862 --> 00:12:28,947
<i>or shipyards and soldiers?</i>

186
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:32,016
<i>- No.
-  No. Of course not.</i>

187
00:12:32,034 --> 00:12:35,520
A wise king knows what he
knows and what he doesn't.

188
00:12:35,538 --> 00:12:37,238
You're young.

189
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:40,742
<i>A wise young king listens
to his counselors</i>

190
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:44,412
and heeds their advice
until he comes of age.

191
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:46,331
And the wisest kings

192
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:50,251
continue to listen to them
long afterwards.

193
00:12:51,554 --> 00:12:52,971
Your brother was not
a wise king.

194
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:55,507
<i>Your brother was not
a good king.</i>

195
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,392
<i>If he had been,</i>

196
00:12:57,426 --> 00:13:00,261
perhaps he'd still
be alive.

197
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:03,431
Now, as the king,
you will have to marry.

198
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:05,716
Do you understand why?

199
00:13:05,734 --> 00:13:07,485
<i>A king needs a queen.</i>

200
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,354
<i>Yes, but why?</i>

201
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:13,057
To further
the family line.

202
00:13:13,075 --> 00:13:16,361
<i>-  Do you know how that happens?
- Yes.</i>

203
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:20,198
Yes, but has anyone explained
the details to you?

204
00:13:20,249 --> 00:13:21,833
I don't think so.

205
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:25,203
It's all relatively
straightforward.

206
00:13:25,254 --> 00:13:27,572
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

207
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,791
You are.
You will be.

208
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:32,043
I'll see to that.

209
00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:39,350
Please give the queen
a moment alone with her son.

210
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:41,386
- Yes, my lord.
- All of you.

211
00:14:10,466 --> 00:14:12,817
It was Tyrion.

212
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,854
He killed him.

213
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:19,757
He told me he would.

214
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:24,962
"A day will come when you
think you are safe and happy

215
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:28,666
and your joy will turn
to ashes in your mouth."

216
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:33,771
That's what he said
to me.

217
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:39,810
You saw it.

218
00:14:39,828 --> 00:14:42,497
You saw Joff point at him
just before he--

219
00:14:42,531 --> 00:14:44,549
I don't know
what I saw.

220
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:49,504
Avenge him.

221
00:14:49,538 --> 00:14:52,040
Avenge our son.

222
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:54,959
Kill Tyrion.

223
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:59,781
Tyrion's my brother.

224
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,733
<i>Our brother.</i>

225
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:04,218
There'll be a trial. We'll get
to the truth of what happened.

226
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,721
I don't want a trial.

227
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:10,224
He'll squirm his way to
freedom given the chance.

228
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:11,976
I want him dead.

229
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:16,898
Please, Jaime.

230
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:19,284
You have to.

231
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:22,870
He was our son.

232
00:15:22,905 --> 00:15:25,239
Our baby boy.

233
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,781
You're a hateful woman.

234
00:16:06,815 --> 00:16:10,084
Why have the gods made
me love a hateful woman?

235
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,461
Jaime, not here,
please.

236
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:22,013
Please.

237
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:24,048
Stop it.

238
00:16:24,082 --> 00:16:27,185
- Stop it. Stop.
- No.

239
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:29,687
Stop it.
Stop.

240
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:36,277
Stop.

241
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:46,487
- Stop.
It's not right.

242
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:49,357
It's not right.
It's not right.

243
00:16:49,391 --> 00:16:51,292
- I don't care.

244
00:16:51,326 --> 00:16:53,411
- Don't.
- I don't care.

245
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:55,713
- Don't. Jaime, don't.
- I don't care.

246
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,950
Gonna rain soon.

247
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:04,338
Where are we?

248
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:09,394
Near Fairmarket,
I think.

249
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:10,895
You think?

250
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:12,296
You don't have a map?

251
00:17:12,314 --> 00:17:15,516
<i>-  No, I don't have a map.
- Maybe we should get one.</i>

252
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:18,653
Just point out the next map shop
you see and I'll buy you one.

253
00:17:18,687 --> 00:17:20,571
How far is it
to the Eyrie?

254
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:23,474
- Far. - And you're sure
we're going the right way?

255
00:17:23,492 --> 00:17:26,744
Believe me, girl, I want
you there as soon as I can.

256
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:29,580
Get my gold,
be on my way.

257
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:32,583
- On your way where?
- Why do you care?

258
00:17:38,707 --> 00:17:42,176
Might book passage
across the Narrow Sea.

259
00:17:42,211 --> 00:17:44,462
<i>Fight as a sellsword.</i>

260
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:49,133
Second Sons, could be.
Seems like a good fit for me.

261
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:50,685
I'd like to see
Braavos one day.

262
00:17:50,719 --> 00:17:53,020
Why Braavos?

263
00:17:53,055 --> 00:17:54,689
I have friends there.

264
00:17:54,723 --> 00:17:56,891
I doubt it.

265
00:17:56,942 --> 00:18:00,645
Seven blessings
to you.

266
00:18:02,197 --> 00:18:05,233
- What do you want? - What do I want?
This is my land.

267
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,034
If I'm standing on it,
it's my land.

268
00:18:07,069 --> 00:18:10,655
We were just watering the horses.
We'll be on our way.

269
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,327
Forgive my father.

270
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:18,880
<i>He was wounded fighting
in the war.</i>

271
00:18:18,914 --> 00:18:22,250
Our cottage burned down while he
was gone and my mother with it.

272
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:27,638
He's never been the same.

273
00:18:32,761 --> 00:18:35,062
Which house did he
fight for?

274
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:41,736
The Tullys of Riverrun.

275
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:47,325
There's a storm coming.

276
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:48,860
<i>You'll be wanting
a roof tonight.</i>

277
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:51,078
<i>There's fresh hay
in the barn.</i>

278
00:18:51,113 --> 00:18:54,282
And Sally here makes rabbit stew
just like her mom used to do.

279
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:58,536
We don't have much,
but any man that bled

280
00:18:58,587 --> 00:19:00,755
for House Tully
is welcome to it.

281
00:19:06,094 --> 00:19:08,579
<i>We ask the Father
to judge us with mercy</i>

282
00:19:08,597 --> 00:19:10,581
<i>accepting our
human frailty.</i>

283
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:12,550
<i>We ask the Mother
to bless our crops</i>

284
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:15,636
so we may feed ourselves
and all who come to our door.

285
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:17,889
<i>We ask the Warrior
to give us courage</i>

286
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:20,090
in these days of strife
and turmoil.

287
00:19:20,108 --> 00:19:22,393
We ask the Maiden
to protect Sally's virtue

288
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:24,094
to keep her from
the clutches of depravity.

289
00:19:24,112 --> 00:19:25,980
You got to do
all seven of the fuckers?

290
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:28,366
Father!

291
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:33,905
We ask the Smith
to strengthen our hands

292
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:36,991
and our backs so we may finish
the work required of us.

293
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:41,245
We ask the Crone to guide us on our
journey from darkness to darkness.

294
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:43,497
And we ask the Stranger
not to kill us

295
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:46,050
in our beds tonight
for no damn reason at all.

296
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:53,808
I'm so sorry.

297
00:20:12,861 --> 00:20:14,779
Really good.

298
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,981
- Did you fight at the Twins?
- Call that a fight?

299
00:20:16,999 --> 00:20:19,417
Slaughtering livestock
more like.

300
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:21,652
The Red Wedding
they're calling it.

301
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:24,505
Walder Frey committed
sacrilege that day.

302
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:28,042
He shared bread and salt with the Starks.
He offered them guest right.

303
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:30,261
Guest right
don't mean much anymore.

304
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:32,930
It means something
to me.

305
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:35,466
The gods will have
their vengeance.

306
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,519
Frey will burn in the seventh
hell for what he did.

307
00:20:38,553 --> 00:20:41,856
Things were different when Hoster
Tully ruled the Riverlands.

308
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:44,675
We had good years and bad
years, same as anyone.

309
00:20:44,693 --> 00:20:47,528
But we were safe.
Now with the Freys,

310
00:20:47,562 --> 00:20:51,649
raiders come plundering, steal
our food, steal our silver.

311
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:53,684
I was gonna send Sally north
to stay with my brother,

312
00:20:53,702 --> 00:20:56,871
but the north's no better.
The whole country's gone sour.

313
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:58,789
You got any ale?

314
00:20:59,741 --> 00:21:01,909
Afraid not.

315
00:21:05,213 --> 00:21:07,565
How can a man
not keep ale in his home?

316
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:12,303
You look like you could
really swing that sword.

317
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:14,839
<i>A real warrior
with proper training.</i>

318
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:18,759
Those raiders wouldn't
stand a chance against you.

319
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:21,429
<i>How would it be if you stayed
on till the new moon?</i>

320
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,214
I could use a man to help
with the farmwork.

321
00:21:24,232 --> 00:21:26,734
Sally does what she can,

322
00:21:26,768 --> 00:21:28,903
but she can't lift
a bale of hay.

323
00:21:28,937 --> 00:21:31,072
And if any thieves came
looking for easy pickings,

324
00:21:31,106 --> 00:21:34,241
one look at you, I'd bet
they'd run the other way.

325
00:21:35,744 --> 00:21:37,578
Meaning no offense.

326
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:45,736
What'll you pay?

327
00:21:45,754 --> 00:21:47,755
I don't have much.

328
00:21:47,789 --> 00:21:51,425
But I have hidden a bit of
silver from the bandits.

329
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:56,430
Fair wages
for fair work?

330
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:03,971
Fair wages
for fair work.

331
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:38,806
<i>- What did you do?!
-  Get your horse saddled.</i>

332
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,892
- You told me you weren't a thief.
- I wasn't.

333
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:44,645
He took us in.
He fed us and you--

334
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:46,463
Aye, he took us in.
He's a good man

335
00:22:46,481 --> 00:22:48,099
and his daughter makes
a nice stew.

336
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:49,850
And they'll both
be dead come winter.

337
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:52,469
- You don't know that.
- I do know it.

338
00:22:52,487 --> 00:22:55,156
He's weak.
He can't protect himself.

339
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:57,808
They'll both be dead
come winter.

340
00:22:57,826 --> 00:22:59,660
Dead men don't need silver.

341
00:22:59,694 --> 00:23:03,781
You're the worst shit
in the Seven Kingdoms.

342
00:23:04,866 --> 00:23:07,001
There's plenty
worse than me.

343
00:23:07,035 --> 00:23:09,370
I just understand
the way things are.

344
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:13,040
How many Starks they got to
behead before you figure it out?

345
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:19,847
Raper. Raper.

346
00:23:19,881 --> 00:23:21,665
Horse thief.

347
00:23:21,683 --> 00:23:23,968
Ninth born son.

348
00:23:24,019 --> 00:23:25,936
Raper.

349
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:28,222
Thief.
Thief and raper.

350
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:31,942
There he is,
Sam the Slayer.

351
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:33,677
Going to visit
your wildling whore?

352
00:23:33,695 --> 00:23:35,863
- She's not a whore.
- No?

353
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:38,365
Maybe I'll give her a
copper tonight and find out.

354
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:45,489
They all think
I'm lying.

355
00:23:45,523 --> 00:23:47,191
About what?

356
00:23:47,209 --> 00:23:49,493
Killing the white walker.

357
00:23:49,527 --> 00:23:52,413
You're not lying.

358
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:54,498
I'll never forget
the way it screamed.

359
00:23:56,218 --> 00:23:58,419
But you're the only one
that saw it.

360
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,137
And they all think
you're just a--

361
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:01,388
A what?

362
00:24:01,423 --> 00:24:04,475
Well, a wildling.

363
00:24:05,427 --> 00:24:07,394
My father hated that word.

364
00:24:07,429 --> 00:24:10,815
It's not a very nice word,
I suppose.

365
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:12,650
I don't know.

366
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:16,737
It makes me sound a bit
dangerous, doesn't it?

367
00:24:28,617 --> 00:24:30,251
So...

368
00:24:30,285 --> 00:24:32,002
are you all right?

369
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:34,588
No one bothering you?

370
00:24:34,623 --> 00:24:36,240
I get a lot of looks.

371
00:24:36,258 --> 00:24:38,375
I hear them making
their jokes.

372
00:24:38,409 --> 00:24:41,378
But no one's touched me
if that's what you mean.

373
00:24:41,412 --> 00:24:44,598
I worry about
it sometimes.

374
00:24:44,633 --> 00:24:46,917
All the time.

375
00:24:46,935 --> 00:24:49,937
Why do you worry
about it?

376
00:24:49,971 --> 00:24:53,023
100 men, one woman.

377
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:55,392
They've got other things
to think about.

378
00:24:55,426 --> 00:24:57,945
That's the only thing
they think about.

379
00:24:57,979 --> 00:25:00,531
- You're being silly.
- I'm not being silly.

380
00:25:00,565 --> 00:25:04,702
There's 100 men lying awake
at night picturing you.

381
00:25:06,621 --> 00:25:08,706
What about you?

382
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:12,009
What about me?

383
00:25:14,796 --> 00:25:17,081
Gilly?

384
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:23,888
I worry about you.

385
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:30,627
Thank you.

386
00:25:30,645 --> 00:25:31,896
For what?

387
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:34,265
For worrying
about me.

388
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:41,272
I don't know
if you're safe here.

389
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,440
They're my brothers,

390
00:25:43,474 --> 00:25:45,859
but some of them were thieves
before they came here.

391
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:47,494
Some of them were rapers.

392
00:25:47,529 --> 00:25:50,331
You saw what they did
at your father's keep.

393
00:25:50,365 --> 00:25:53,784
So what are you saying?

394
00:25:56,338 --> 00:26:01,208
Maybe you'd be safer
in Mole's Town.

395
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:08,098
Are you bored of me?

396
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:10,884
Bored of you?

397
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:13,354
I...

398
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:18,842
I want to protect you.

399
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:27,184
I'll get these to Hobb.

400
00:26:27,202 --> 00:26:29,570
Keep an eye
on little Sam.

401
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:01,185
Your Grace.

402
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:04,355
You're a literary man now.
What do you make of that?

403
00:27:14,565 --> 00:27:18,085
- Joffrey? - The usurper
Joffrey Baratheon.

404
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:21,455
<i>I said those words when I
tossed a leech into the fire.</i>

405
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:24,258
A leech filled with
bastard blood.

406
00:27:24,292 --> 00:27:26,677
A bastard you set free.

407
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:29,296
I am now faced with
a great opportunity

408
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:31,131
and I am powerless
to take advantage of it.

409
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:32,933
I will find you
an army, Your Grace.

410
00:27:32,967 --> 00:27:35,469
- I've been working day and night--
- What progress have you made?

411
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,521
I've rallied House Peasebury
to your cause.

412
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:39,223
House Peasebury.

413
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:42,526
- House Musgood.
- House Musgood.

414
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,895
- And House Haigh.
- House Haigh.

415
00:27:49,951 --> 00:27:52,903
They don't have enough men
between them to raid a pantry.

416
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:56,457
Westeros is not
the world, Your Grace.

417
00:27:56,491 --> 00:27:58,275
We need to look east
for ships and men.

418
00:27:58,293 --> 00:28:01,611
10,000 skilled soldiers
fight for the Golden Company.

419
00:28:01,629 --> 00:28:03,630
- The Golden Company? - They've
never broken a contract.

420
00:28:03,665 --> 00:28:05,082
They're sellswords.

421
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:06,834
We're willing to use blood magic
to put you on the throne,

422
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:08,635
but we're not willing
to pay men to fight?

423
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:11,088
Now the Red Woman's
magic is real.

424
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:13,307
Her visions and prophecies
may be, too,

425
00:28:13,341 --> 00:28:16,176
but I've never heard of visions
and prophecies winning a war.

426
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:18,562
Soldiers win wars.
Soldiers on the ground.

427
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:19,897
It's dirty on the ground.

428
00:28:19,931 --> 00:28:21,798
We don't have any gold.

429
00:28:21,816 --> 00:28:23,016
Not yet.

430
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:29,106
If I do not
press my claim,

431
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,191
my claim
will be forgotten.

432
00:28:31,242 --> 00:28:34,778
I will not become a page in
someone else's history book.

433
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:37,998
I'm running out
of time, Ser Davos.

434
00:28:38,032 --> 00:28:41,168
Which means you're
running out of time.

435
00:28:46,174 --> 00:28:47,791
You're late.

436
00:28:47,825 --> 00:28:49,343
I'm sorry, Princess.

437
00:28:49,377 --> 00:28:51,161
I thought you
weren't coming.

438
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:53,830
The Hand of the King doesn't
have much leisure time.

439
00:28:53,848 --> 00:28:57,468
You won't be a very good Hand if you see
the word knight and say "ka-nigit."

440
00:28:57,519 --> 00:28:58,969
That happened once,
weeks ago.

441
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:01,021
You're your father's
daughter, no mistake.

442
00:29:01,055 --> 00:29:03,023
Bloody relentless,
the both of you.

443
00:29:03,057 --> 00:29:05,675
It's a new one today.
Lots of tricky words.

444
00:29:05,693 --> 00:29:07,895
But I think you can manage.

445
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:12,182
You'll never read well
if you move your lips.

446
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,401
That's how children do it.

447
00:29:19,207 --> 00:29:23,594
"The Life and Adventures
of Elyo Grivas

448
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:25,963
First Sword of Braavos."

449
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:27,965
Thank you very much.

450
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:31,301
I like this one. It's full
of sword fights and pirates.

451
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:33,036
You were a pirate once.

452
00:29:33,054 --> 00:29:34,938
No, I was never a pirate.
I was a smuggler.

453
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:36,173
What's the difference?

454
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:38,175
Well, if you're
a famous smuggler,

455
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:39,843
you're not doing it right.

456
00:29:39,877 --> 00:29:41,645
My father says
a criminal is a criminal.

457
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,380
Your father lacks
an appreciation

458
00:29:43,398 --> 00:29:45,649
of the finer points
of bad behavior.

459
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:47,851
So do the Braavosi.

460
00:29:47,885 --> 00:29:49,553
- You've sailed to Braavos?
- Of course.

461
00:29:49,571 --> 00:29:52,389
Almost got beheaded
by a First Sword of Braavos.

462
00:29:52,407 --> 00:29:56,726
I tried to explain to him the difference
between pirates and smugglers,

463
00:29:56,744 --> 00:30:00,531
but he didn't seem any more interested
in the distinction than your father.

464
00:30:00,582 --> 00:30:02,282
I suppose if you work
for the Iron Bank of Braavos

465
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:04,785
and each one of your gold
barges is worth half a kingdom,

466
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:08,789
you tend not to be overly concerned
with the kind of distinction--

467
00:30:27,141 --> 00:30:29,610
- What was that for? - I
need you to write a message.

468
00:30:29,644 --> 00:30:31,778
You should write it yourself.
It's good practice.

469
00:30:31,813 --> 00:30:33,363
It's too important for me.

470
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:36,600
I need a smart person
to do it. Go on.

471
00:30:36,618 --> 00:30:40,704
To the offices
of the Iron Bank of Braavos

472
00:30:40,738 --> 00:30:44,458
from Stannis Baratheon the
one true king of Westeros.

473
00:30:44,492 --> 00:30:45,993
But that's not you.

474
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:47,777
I need to get
their attention.

475
00:30:47,795 --> 00:30:50,497
Go on. Write.

476
00:31:00,341 --> 00:31:02,759
He's seen some
adventures, hasn't he?

477
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:25,482
- Precious little thing.
- Thank you.

478
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,368
- What's his name?
- Sam.

479
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:30,087
Lovely.

480
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:31,922
That the daddy?

481
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:33,090
No.

482
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:34,625
Where's the daddy?

483
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:37,177
He's dead.

484
00:31:37,211 --> 00:31:40,130
Oh. Where you from?

485
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,833
North of here.

486
00:31:43,851 --> 00:31:46,103
North of here?

487
00:31:49,524 --> 00:31:52,142
You a fucking wildling?

488
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:55,011
- Only room and board?
- That's right.

489
00:31:55,029 --> 00:31:57,698
She'll clean and cook

490
00:31:57,732 --> 00:31:59,232
and look after the other
girls' babies.

491
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:02,119
Could find other
work for her, too.

492
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:04,705
- No other work.
- There'd be money.

493
00:32:04,739 --> 00:32:06,373
Give you a piece of it.

494
00:32:06,407 --> 00:32:08,875
No other work.

495
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:33,183
I promise to come back
and visit whenever I can.

496
00:32:36,571 --> 00:32:38,739
You'll be safer here.

497
00:32:38,773 --> 00:32:40,924
Who's gonna protect you
at Castle Black? Me?

498
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:44,060
You protected me
north of the Wall.

499
00:32:44,078 --> 00:32:45,946
This is different.

500
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:47,414
They're brothers
of the Night's Watch

501
00:32:47,448 --> 00:32:49,249
and I can't just stab
them in the back

502
00:32:49,283 --> 00:32:52,419
and I can't run away, which
is what we did at Craster's.

503
00:32:54,455 --> 00:32:57,457
You have to trust me.

504
00:32:57,508 --> 00:32:59,126
It's for the best.

505
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:05,716
Best for you.

506
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,268
Oh, Gilly.

507
00:33:10,104 --> 00:33:11,521
Please don't.

508
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:46,556
Greedy.

509
00:33:52,814 --> 00:33:54,815
No?

510
00:33:54,849 --> 00:33:56,683
I'm sorry.
You're lovely,

511
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:58,652
I just never
acquired the taste.

512
00:33:58,686 --> 00:34:01,304
You're calling my beauty
an acquired taste?

513
00:34:01,322 --> 00:34:04,991
That's quite all right, lover.
It's more for you.

514
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:10,113
Your loss.

515
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:17,788
You like them
both the same?

516
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:20,006
- Boys and girls?
- Does that surprise you?

517
00:34:20,041 --> 00:34:21,708
Everyone has a preference.

518
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:24,528
Then everyone is missing
half the world's pleasure.

519
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:29,466
<i>The gods made that
and it delights me.</i>

520
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,301
The gods made this

521
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:33,270
and it delights me.

522
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:36,306
When it comes to war,
I fight for Dorne.

523
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:40,110
When it comes to love,
I don't choose sides.

524
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:42,479
I hope I have as much
stamina when I'm your age.

525
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:44,180
What are you, 25?

526
00:34:44,198 --> 00:34:47,400
- Children.

527
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:49,870
Someday,
if you're lucky,

528
00:34:49,904 --> 00:34:51,688
you will wake up
and realize you are old.

529
00:34:51,706 --> 00:34:53,740
That pretty ass
of yours will sag.

530
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:57,193
Your belly will grow soft and
your back will ache in the night

531
00:34:57,211 --> 00:35:01,298
and gray hairs will sprout
from your ears.

532
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:03,667
<i>No one will want
you anymore.</i>

533
00:35:03,718 --> 00:35:06,920
Make sure you fucked
your fill before that day.

534
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:09,923
Did you?

535
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:13,042
He is a prince of Dorne.

536
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:15,979
Girls and boys
will line up

537
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:18,932
to fuck him
till the day he dies.

538
00:35:21,402 --> 00:35:24,604
They will all have
to line up behind you.

539
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:32,829
<i>-  Prince Oberyn.
- Lord Tywin.</i>

540
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:35,115
May we have the room?

541
00:35:38,419 --> 00:35:40,871
Call my name
if you need me, lover.

542
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:53,300
Would you like
to sit?

543
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:55,685
No, thank you.

544
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,270
Some wine?

545
00:35:57,305 --> 00:35:59,306
<i>No, thank you.</i>

546
00:36:01,142 --> 00:36:03,810
- I'm sorry about your grandson.
- Are you?

547
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:07,898
I don't believe that a child is
responsible for the sins of his father.

548
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:10,600
Or his grandfather.

549
00:36:10,618 --> 00:36:12,869
An awful way to die.

550
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:15,104
Which way is that?

551
00:36:15,122 --> 00:36:18,341
Are you interrogating
me, Lord Tywin?

552
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:19,876
Some believe
the king choked.

553
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:22,379
Some believe the sky
is blue because we live

554
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:24,965
inside the eye
of a blue-eyed giant.

555
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:29,186
The king was poisoned.

556
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:32,289
I hear you studied
poisons at the Citadel.

557
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:34,674
I did.
This is why I know.

558
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:38,195
Your hatred for my family
is rather well known.

559
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:41,231
You arrive at the capital,
an expert in poisoning,

560
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:45,035
some days later my grandson
dies of poisoning.

561
00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:46,403
Rather suspicious.

562
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:48,321
Why haven't you thrown
me in a dungeon?

563
00:36:48,356 --> 00:36:50,824
You spoke with Tyrion
in this very brothel

564
00:36:50,858 --> 00:36:53,109
on the day
that you arrived.

565
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:54,411
What did you discuss?

566
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:56,479
You think
we conspired together?

567
00:36:56,497 --> 00:36:57,881
What did you discuss?

568
00:36:57,915 --> 00:37:01,284
The death of my sister.

569
00:37:01,318 --> 00:37:02,953
For which you blame me.

570
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:05,154
She was raped and murdered
by the Mountain.

571
00:37:05,172 --> 00:37:08,008
The Mountain follows
your orders.

572
00:37:08,042 --> 00:37:09,626
Of course I blame you.

573
00:37:09,677 --> 00:37:12,128
Here I stand unarmed,
unguarded.

574
00:37:12,162 --> 00:37:13,763
Should I be concerned?

575
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:17,384
You are unarmed and unguarded because
you know me better than that.

576
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:19,970
I am a man of reason.

577
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:21,972
If I cut
your throat today,

578
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:23,673
I will be drawn
and quartered tomorrow.

579
00:37:23,724 --> 00:37:25,725
Men at war commit
all kinds of crimes

580
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:27,560
without their
superiors' knowledge.

581
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:30,113
So you deny involvement
in Elia's murder?

582
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:32,866
Categorically.

583
00:37:42,076 --> 00:37:44,461
I would like to speak
with the Mountain.

584
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:47,280
I'm sure he would enjoy
speaking with you.

585
00:37:47,315 --> 00:37:50,200
He might not enjoy it as
much as he thinks he would.

586
00:37:51,585 --> 00:37:54,754
I could arrange
for this meeting.

587
00:37:54,805 --> 00:37:58,558
But you want
something in return.

588
00:37:58,592 --> 00:38:01,177
There will be a trial
for my son.

589
00:38:01,211 --> 00:38:03,263
And as custom dictates,

590
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:06,215
three judges
will render a verdict.

591
00:38:06,233 --> 00:38:07,651
I will preside.

592
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:10,854
Mace Tyrell will serve
as the second judge.

593
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:13,189
I would like you
to be the third.

594
00:38:13,223 --> 00:38:15,075
Why?

595
00:38:15,109 --> 00:38:18,611
Not long ago, the Tyrells
sided with Renly Baratheon.

596
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:21,564
Declared themselves
enemies of the throne.

597
00:38:21,615 --> 00:38:23,733
Now they are
our strongest allies.

598
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:25,952
Well, you made
the Tyrell girl a queen.

599
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:29,739
Asking me to judge at your son's
trial isn't quite as tempting.

600
00:38:29,757 --> 00:38:33,593
I will also invite you
to sit on the small council

601
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:37,263
to serve as one of the new
king's principal advisors.

602
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:47,691
I never realized you had such
respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin.

603
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:51,311
We are not the Seven Kingdoms
until Dorne returns to the fold.

604
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:55,115
The king is dead. The Greyjoys
are in open rebellion.

605
00:38:55,149 --> 00:38:58,401
A wildling army
marches on the Wall.

606
00:38:58,435 --> 00:39:02,872
And in the East, a Targaryen
girl has three dragons.

607
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:07,961
Before long, she will
turn her eyes to Westeros.

608
00:39:07,995 --> 00:39:10,880
Only the Dornish
managed to resist

609
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:13,750
Aegon Targaryen
and his dragons.

610
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:16,636
You're saying
you need us?

611
00:39:18,288 --> 00:39:20,790
That must be hard
for you to admit.

612
00:39:20,808 --> 00:39:23,760
We need each other.

613
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:27,480
You help me serve justice
to the king's assassins

614
00:39:27,515 --> 00:39:30,483
and I will help you
serve justice to Elia's.

615
00:39:49,203 --> 00:39:51,204
Podrick.

616
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:54,090
Apologies for the stench.

617
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:56,543
I brought you some wine, my
lord, but they took it from me.

618
00:39:56,594 --> 00:39:58,344
A noble effort.

619
00:39:58,379 --> 00:40:00,680
They didn't find
the candles, though.

620
00:40:00,714 --> 00:40:02,999
A quill, some parchment,

621
00:40:03,017 --> 00:40:05,819
duck sausage,
almonds,

622
00:40:05,853 --> 00:40:08,938
and some hard cheese.

623
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:10,740
You're a good lad.

624
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:12,842
Any word of Shae?

625
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:14,477
I've heard nothing,
my lord.

626
00:40:14,511 --> 00:40:17,230
I suppose
that's a good thing.

627
00:40:18,699 --> 00:40:21,151
What are they saying
about me out there?

628
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:24,204
You're to stand trial
in a fortnight

629
00:40:24,238 --> 00:40:26,022
for murdering the king.

630
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,208
Do you believe
I murdered Joffrey?

631
00:40:28,242 --> 00:40:30,093
No, my lord.

632
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:31,961
You didn't?

633
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:34,697
No. Gods, no.

634
00:40:34,715 --> 00:40:36,933
The world is a better
place without him,

635
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:39,202
but I had nothing
to do with it.

636
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,254
I would like to think

637
00:40:41,305 --> 00:40:43,389
if I were arranging
a royal assassination,

638
00:40:43,424 --> 00:40:45,925
I'd plan it in such a way that
I wouldn't be standing there

639
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:49,062
gawking like a fool
when the king died.

640
00:40:50,547 --> 00:40:53,183
Trial in a fortnight.

641
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:55,652
<i>Have they announced
the judges yet?</i>

642
00:40:57,855 --> 00:41:01,074
- Your father.
- Of course.

643
00:41:01,108 --> 00:41:03,660
Mace Tyrell.

644
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:06,946
Who will vote exactly as my
father tells him to vote.

645
00:41:06,981 --> 00:41:09,415
And Prince Oberyn
of Dorne.

646
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,367
Oberyn?

647
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:13,736
Give it to my father.

648
00:41:13,754 --> 00:41:16,506
He never fails to take
advantage of a family tragedy.

649
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:19,792
I'm supposed to get a list
of names from you, my lord.

650
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:22,846
Anyone who might testify
on your behalf.

651
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,298
Oh, I can call
my own witnesses?

652
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:26,883
<i>How generous of them.</i>

653
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:28,885
Very well, my wife.
Sansa.

654
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:30,586
My lord, she's gone.

655
00:41:30,604 --> 00:41:33,923
<i>- Gone? - No one's seen
her since the wedding.</i>

656
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:39,462
You don't think she...

657
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:46,435
<i>No one had more cause
to kill Joffrey than Sansa,</i>

658
00:41:46,453 --> 00:41:48,371
but the girl
is no assassin.

659
00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:51,624
Whoever killed the king wanted
me to lose my head for it.

660
00:41:51,659 --> 00:41:55,328
And with my wife's disappearance, it
makes me seem that much more guilty.

661
00:41:55,379 --> 00:41:58,047
- Podrick.
- Yes, my lord?

662
00:41:58,082 --> 00:41:59,716
- They'll be following you now.
- Who will?

663
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:02,552
I don't know. They.
They. The ominous they.

664
00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:05,505
The man pulling the strings.
Or woman. My father.

665
00:42:05,556 --> 00:42:08,958
Maybe Joffrey
was too much work for him.

666
00:42:08,976 --> 00:42:11,928
Sweet Tommen will be
so much easier to handle.

667
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:14,764
Whenever something
bad happens to me,

668
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:17,183
I assume it's my sister
that had a hand in it.

669
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:19,802
<i>But say what
you will of Cersei,</i>

670
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:21,470
she loves her children.

671
00:42:21,488 --> 00:42:25,474
She is the only one I'm certain had
nothing to do with this murder.

672
00:42:25,492 --> 00:42:27,577
Which makes it unique

673
00:42:27,611 --> 00:42:29,979
as King's Landing
murders go.

674
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:32,949
Any other witnesses,
my lord?

675
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:35,084
Varys could vouch
for me if he dared.

676
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,320
He's already been called
as a witness for the queen.

677
00:42:37,338 --> 00:42:39,706
Of course. Fetch Bronn.
I have a job for him.

678
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:41,090
I've already asked,
my lord.

679
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:42,559
- They won't let him see you.
- Why not?

680
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:45,661
They say he's a known cutthroat
and your close associate.

681
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:47,096
He's under
investigation himself.

682
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:50,600
And my brother? Will they at
least allow me to see Jaime?

683
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:53,186
I'll ask, my lord.

684
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,985
There's something else,
my lord.

685
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:12,789
A man,
I didn't know his face,

686
00:43:12,823 --> 00:43:15,408
he came to ask if
I'd testify against you.

687
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:18,328
Said I'd be named
Ser Podrick Payne

688
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:21,864
if I told the judges you'd bought
a poison called the Strangler.

689
00:43:21,882 --> 00:43:24,000
Ser Podrick Payne?

690
00:43:24,034 --> 00:43:26,669
Has a nice ring to it.
What did you tell him?

691
00:43:26,703 --> 00:43:28,571
I didn't tell them
anything, my lord.

692
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,808
Are you going to
accept their offer?

693
00:43:31,842 --> 00:43:33,676
My lord.

694
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:35,778
Testifying against me
wasn't a suggestion.

695
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:37,263
If they can't
tempt you with honey,

696
00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:39,065
they'll choose something
less sweet.

697
00:43:39,099 --> 00:43:40,433
You've been good
to me, my lord.

698
00:43:40,484 --> 00:43:42,986
Pod, the trial's in
a fortnight.

699
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,687
They'll want an answer
before that.

700
00:43:44,721 --> 00:43:46,990
I already gave them
an answer, my lord.

701
00:43:48,242 --> 00:43:51,077
I will not have you
dying on my behalf.

702
00:43:51,111 --> 00:43:53,196
Do you hear me?
If I have to take

703
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:55,031
that long walk to
the executioner's block,

704
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:57,583
I don't want to see
your head already mounted.

705
00:43:57,618 --> 00:44:00,670
- My lord. - Pod, I am
giving you an order.

706
00:44:01,872 --> 00:44:05,208
Go and find my brother.
Tell him I need him.

707
00:44:05,242 --> 00:44:07,627
And get yourself
out of King's Landing

708
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:09,595
before it's too late.

709
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:11,247
Pod!

710
00:44:11,265 --> 00:44:13,182
This is farewell.

711
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:18,271
Farewell, my lord.

712
00:44:22,776 --> 00:44:25,395
Pod.

713
00:44:27,781 --> 00:44:31,150
There has never lived
a more loyal squire.

714
00:44:55,259 --> 00:44:56,926
Mother says
it's time to eat.

715
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,229
What's she got boiling?
Wait. Wait. Let me guess.

716
00:45:00,264 --> 00:45:02,148
- Potatoes.
- Potatoes.

717
00:45:02,182 --> 00:45:05,234
Well, no one boils a potato
better than your mom.

718
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:06,886
Has she got--

719
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:09,605
<i>The wildlings!</i>

720
00:45:09,639 --> 00:45:11,023
Guymon!

721
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:14,110
Hide.

722
00:45:14,144 --> 00:45:16,162
Hide!

723
00:46:06,863 --> 00:46:09,132
You know how to get
to Castle Black?

724
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:11,000
Yes. Yes.

725
00:46:18,475 --> 00:46:20,593
Those your parents?

726
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:24,147
Open your eyes.

727
00:46:25,382 --> 00:46:27,099
I'm going to eat them.

728
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:28,901
Do you hear me?

729
00:46:28,936 --> 00:46:31,604
I'm going to eat
your dead mama

730
00:46:31,655 --> 00:46:35,224
and I'm going to eat
your dead papa.

731
00:46:35,242 --> 00:46:38,828
Go tell the crows
at Castle Black.

732
00:46:47,171 --> 00:46:50,122
<i>We need to teach them a lesson about
the way we deal with their kind.</i>

733
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:51,424
<i>Aye! Aye!</i>

734
00:46:51,458 --> 00:46:53,209
<i>Three dozen bodies
with slit throats</i>

735
00:46:53,243 --> 00:46:55,378
<i>tossed off the top
of the Wall.</i>

736
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:57,513
- Seems like that would be a good lesson.
- Aye!

737
00:46:57,548 --> 00:47:00,266
If we go after them, we'll be
giving them what they want.

738
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:02,468
They want to draw us out,

739
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:04,804
pick us off
a few at a time.

740
00:47:04,855 --> 00:47:07,557
We have just over
100 men.

741
00:47:07,608 --> 00:47:11,360
And that's including
stewards and builders.

742
00:47:11,395 --> 00:47:14,897
And me. We can't afford
to lose a single man.

743
00:47:14,931 --> 00:47:18,934
We must remember our
first responsibility.

744
00:47:18,952 --> 00:47:22,371
We are the watchers
on the Wall.

745
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:25,374
There's got to be
a way to protect them.

746
00:47:26,877 --> 00:47:29,495
You're a champion of the
common people, Lord Snow.

747
00:47:29,546 --> 00:47:32,465
<i>What do you say to
Brother Pyp's proposition?</i>

748
00:47:36,386 --> 00:47:38,921
Mance Rayder is coming.

749
00:47:40,507 --> 00:47:42,958
If the wildlings
breach the Wall,

750
00:47:42,976 --> 00:47:45,845
they'll roll over everything
and everyone for 1,000 miles

751
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:47,947
before they reach an army
that can stop them.

752
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:54,337
We need to shore up
Castle Black

753
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:57,807
and we need
to defend the Wall.

754
00:47:57,841 --> 00:48:00,276
<i>That is our job.</i>

755
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:08,251
Rangers returning.

756
00:48:14,374 --> 00:48:16,208
Help him.

757
00:48:18,345 --> 00:48:21,297
Thought you'd have
blue eyes by now.

758
00:48:25,052 --> 00:48:26,936
What took you so long?

759
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:28,854
- We were held up.
- By what?

760
00:48:28,889 --> 00:48:30,222
Chains.

761
00:48:30,274 --> 00:48:33,976
We were guests of the
mutineers at Craster's Keep.

762
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:36,729
- And the mutineers stayed?
- They're not going anywhere.

763
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:39,198
They've got Craster's food
and his wives.

764
00:48:39,232 --> 00:48:41,651
<i>Poor girls.</i>

765
00:48:41,685 --> 00:48:43,736
Never thought they'd
miss their daddy.

766
00:48:43,787 --> 00:48:45,288
Karl's running things now.

767
00:48:45,322 --> 00:48:47,823
He's the one who put a knife
through Craster's mouth.

768
00:48:47,857 --> 00:48:49,625
We need to ride north
and kill them all.

769
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:51,160
We just went
over this, boy.

770
00:48:51,194 --> 00:48:53,663
- Justice can wait.
- It's not about justice.

771
00:48:55,532 --> 00:48:59,719
I told the wildlings we had over
1,000 men at Castle Black alone.

772
00:49:01,555 --> 00:49:05,224
Karl and the others know
the truth as well as we do.

773
00:49:05,258 --> 00:49:07,760
How long do you think they'll keep
that information to themselves

774
00:49:07,811 --> 00:49:11,230
when the wildlings are peeling
their fingernails off?

775
00:49:11,264 --> 00:49:14,900
Mance has all he needs to crush
us, he just doesn't know it yet.

776
00:49:14,935 --> 00:49:18,321
As soon as he gets
his hands on them, he will.

777
00:49:18,355 --> 00:49:20,906
Then he'll throw
his full strength at us.

778
00:49:20,941 --> 00:49:24,360
And even if every one
of us kills 100 wildlings,

779
00:49:24,394 --> 00:49:27,330
there's still not a thing
we can do to stop them.

780
00:49:29,449 --> 00:49:31,834
I don't think I can
kill 100 wildlings.

781
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:36,182
<i>Are they attacking?</i>

782
00:50:36,216 --> 00:50:39,468
<i>A single rider.</i>

783
00:50:39,503 --> 00:50:42,638
<i>A champion of Meereen.</i>

784
00:50:42,656 --> 00:50:45,775
<i>They want you to send your
own champion against him.</i>

785
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:13,669
What is he doing?

786
00:51:13,687 --> 00:51:15,855
I believe he means to...

787
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:27,149
He says that we're an army
of men without man parts.

788
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,369
He claims you are no woman
at all, but a man who...

789
00:51:30,403 --> 00:51:33,322
hides his cock
in his own asshole.

790
00:51:33,356 --> 00:51:36,325
Ignore him, Your Grace.
These are meaningless words.

791
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:39,795
They're not meaningless if half the city
you intend to take is listening to them.

792
00:51:43,717 --> 00:51:46,802
I have something to say
to the people of Meereen.

793
00:51:48,054 --> 00:51:51,340
First, I will need
this one to be quiet.

794
00:51:51,374 --> 00:51:53,092
Do I have a champion?

795
00:52:02,986 --> 00:52:06,822
Your Grace, I've won more single
combats than any man alive.

796
00:52:06,857 --> 00:52:09,692
Which is why you must
remain by my side.

797
00:52:09,726 --> 00:52:13,162
I've been by your side longer
than any of them, Khaleesi.

798
00:52:13,196 --> 00:52:14,830
Let me stand for you
today as well.

799
00:52:14,865 --> 00:52:16,782
You are my most
trusted advisor,

800
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:19,835
my most valued general,
and my dearest friend.

801
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:21,704
I will not gamble
with your life.

802
00:52:21,738 --> 00:52:24,072
I was the last
to join your army.

803
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:26,458
I'm not your general or a
member of your Queensguard

804
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:27,743
or the commander
of your Unsullied.

805
00:52:27,761 --> 00:52:30,763
My mother was a whore.
I come from nothing.

806
00:52:30,797 --> 00:52:33,432
And before long,
I will return to nothing.

807
00:52:34,851 --> 00:52:37,303
Let me kill
this man for you.

808
00:52:38,188 --> 00:52:39,555
Very well.

809
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:41,056
You have quite
an audience.

810
00:52:41,091 --> 00:52:43,809
Make it worth
their while.

811
00:52:45,228 --> 00:52:47,279
He is very brave,
Your Grace.

812
00:52:47,314 --> 00:52:49,148
Yes, win or lose,

813
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:51,066
<i>as long as the whole
city is watching.</i>

814
00:53:02,829 --> 00:53:04,463
You sure you don't
want a horse?

815
00:53:04,497 --> 00:53:06,248
<i>Why would I want
a horse?</i>

816
00:53:06,282 --> 00:53:08,801
Horses are faster than men.

817
00:53:08,835 --> 00:53:11,754
Horses are dumber than men.
