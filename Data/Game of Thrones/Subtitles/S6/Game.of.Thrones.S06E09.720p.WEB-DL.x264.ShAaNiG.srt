The Masters cannot

you could have returned to your

We'll find out soon enough.

172
00:15:38,903 --> 00:15:43,238

<i>the walls of Winterfell
and wait us out.</i>

175
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,429
That's not his way. He knows
the North is watching.

176
00:16:07,431 --> 00:16:10,364
If the other houses
sense weakness on his part,

177
00:16:10,366 --> 00:16:12,166
they'll stop fearing him.

178
00:16:12,168 --> 00:16:14,936
He can't have that.
Fear is his power.

179
00:16:14,938 --> 00:16:17,638
It's his weakness, too. His men
don't want to fight for him.

180
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,341
They're forced to fight for him.
If they feel the tide turning...

181
00:16:20,343 --> 00:16:22,743
It's not his men that worry me.

182
00:16:22,745 --> 00:16:24,178
It's his horses.

183
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,447
I know what mounted
knights can do to us.

184
00:16:26,449 --> 00:16:29,683
You and Stannis cut through us
like piss through snow.

185
00:16:29,685 --> 00:16:32,018
We're digging trenches
all along our flanks.

186
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,321
They won't be able to hit us
the way that Stannis hit you,

187
00:16:34,323 --> 00:16:35,656
in a double envelopment.

188
00:16:39,695 --> 00:16:41,528
A pincer move.

189
00:16:46,435 --> 00:16:49,035
They won't be able
to hit us from the sides.

190
00:16:49,037 --> 00:16:50,937
Good.

191
00:16:53,342 --> 00:16:56,176
It's crucial that
we let them charge at us.

192
00:16:57,579 --> 00:17:00,180
They've got the numbers,
we need the patience.

193
00:17:03,018 --> 00:17:06,118
If we let him buckle
our center, he'll pursue.

194
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,689
Then we'll have him
surrounded on three sides.

195
00:17:09,691 --> 00:17:13,493
Did you really think that cunt
would fight you man-to-man?

196
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:16,228
No.

197
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:18,130
But I wanted to make him angry.

198
00:17:20,735 --> 00:17:23,168
I want him coming at us full tilt.

199
00:17:25,006 --> 00:17:27,006

Aye, for what they're worth.

204

You've known him for the space

205
00:17:54,234 --> 00:17:56,166
you and your trusted advisors,

206

00:18:02,408 --> 00:18:04,141
I know the way his mind works.

210
00:18:04,143 --> 00:18:07,310
I know how he likes to hurt people.

211
00:18:07,312 --> 00:18:11,581
Did it ever once occur to you
that I might have some insight?

212
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,785
You're right.

213
00:18:15,787 --> 00:18:18,522
You think he's going
to fall into your trap.

214
00:18:18,524 --> 00:18:20,890
He won't. He's the
one who lays traps.

215
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:23,793
- <i>He's overconfident.</i>
- He plays with people.

216
00:18:23,795 --> 00:18:26,530
He's far better at it than you.
He's been doing it all his life.

217
00:18:26,532 --> 00:18:29,465
Aye, and what have I been doing all
my life? Playing with broomsticks?

218
00:18:29,467 --> 00:18:33,369
I fought beyond the Wall against
worse than Ramsay Bolton.

219
00:18:33,371 --> 00:18:36,205
I've defended the Wall
from worse than Ramsay Bolton.

220
00:18:36,207 --> 00:18:38,775
You don't know him.

221
00:18:40,045 --> 00:18:42,078
All right, tell me.

222
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,947
What should we do?
How do we get Rickon back?

223
00:18:46,884 --> 00:18:48,650
We'll never get him back.

224
00:18:50,188 --> 00:18:53,155
Rickon is Ned Stark's trueborn son,

225
00:18:53,157 --> 00:18:54,990
which makes him
a greater threat to Ramsay

226
00:18:54,992 --> 00:18:58,160
than you, a bastard, or me, a girl.

227
00:18:58,162 --> 00:19:01,196
As long as he lives, Ramsay's claim
to Winterfell will be contested,

228
00:19:01,198 --> 00:19:04,800
which means he won't live long.

229
00:19:04,802 --> 00:19:07,268
We can't give up on our brother.

230
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:10,438
Listen to me, please. He
wants you to make a mistake.

231
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,609
Of course he does. What
should I do differently?

232
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:15,777
I don't know. I don't know
anything about battles.

233
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:19,280
Just don't do
what he wants you to do.

234
00:19:19,282 --> 00:19:20,582
Aye, that's good advice.

235
00:19:20,584 --> 00:19:22,083
You think that's obvious?

236
00:19:22,085 --> 00:19:23,518
Well, it is a bit obvious.

237
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,885
If you had asked
for my advice earlier,

238
00:19:24,887 --> 00:19:26,654
I would have told you
not to attack Winterfell

239
00:19:26,656 --> 00:19:29,090
until we had a larger force,
or is that obvious, too?

240
00:19:29,092 --> 00:19:31,459
When will we have a larger force?

241
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,628
We've pleaded with every
house that'll have us.

242
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:34,962
The Blackfish can't help us.

243
00:19:34,964 --> 00:19:37,031
We're lucky to have this many men.

244
00:19:37,033 --> 00:19:40,534
- It's not enough.
- No, it's not enough. It's what we have.

245
00:19:44,907 --> 00:19:48,876
Battles have been won
against greater odds.

246
00:19:55,217 --> 00:19:57,184
If Ramsay wins,

247
00:19:57,186 --> 00:19:59,219
I'm not going back there alive.

248
00:19:59,221 --> 00:20:00,887
Do you understand me?

249
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:07,393
I won't let ever
let him touch you again.

251

and I loved the man he burned.

Mance didn't have
demons in his skull.

271
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:28,072
He didn't torch people
or listen to some red witch.

But I was wrong just like you.

275

Maybe that was our mistake,
believing in kings.

00:27:02,831 --> 00:27:06,466
But then, we all live
complicated lives, don't we?

341
00:27:06,468 --> 00:27:08,535
You've brought us 100 ships
from the Iron Fleet

342
00:27:08,537 --> 00:27:10,270
<i>with men to sail them.</i>

343
00:27:10,272 --> 00:27:12,573
In return, I expect
you want me to support

344
00:27:12,575 --> 00:27:15,108
your claim to the throne
of the Iron Islands?

345
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:17,110
Not my claim.
Hers.

346
00:27:17,112 --> 00:27:19,212
And what's wrong with you?

347
00:27:19,214 --> 00:27:20,780
I'm not fit to rule.

348
00:27:20,782 --> 00:27:22,482
We can agree upon that at least.

349
00:27:22,484 --> 00:27:25,151
Has the Iron Islands
ever had a queen before?

350
00:27:25,153 --> 00:27:26,752
No more than Westeros.

351
00:27:28,523 --> 00:27:31,958
Our Uncle Euron returned home
after a long absence.

352
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,594
He murdered our father and took
the Salt Throne from Yara.

353
00:27:35,596 --> 00:27:38,163
He would have murdered us
if we'd stayed.

354
00:27:39,633 --> 00:27:42,800
Lord Tyrion tells me your
father was a terrible king.

355
00:27:42,802 --> 00:27:44,936
You and I have that in common.

356
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,805
We do.

357
00:27:47,807 --> 00:27:50,142
And both murdered
by a usurper as well.

358
00:27:51,477 --> 00:27:53,144
Will their ships be enough?

359
00:27:53,146 --> 00:27:56,280
With the former Masters'
fleet, possibly.

360
00:27:56,282 --> 00:27:58,415
Barely.

361
00:27:58,417 --> 00:28:01,218
There are more than 100
ships in the Iron Fleet.

362
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,721
There are and Euron is building more.

363
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,456
He's going to offer them to you.

364
00:28:05,458 --> 00:28:06,958
So why shouldn't I wait for him?

365
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,627
The Iron Fleet
isn't all he's bringing.

366
00:28:09,629 --> 00:28:11,828
He also wants
to give you...

367
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:15,566
His big cock, I think he said.

368
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:18,902
<i>Euron's offer is also an
offer of marriage, you see.</i>

369
00:28:18,904 --> 00:28:20,771
<i>You won't get one without the other.</i>

370
00:28:20,773 --> 00:28:23,407
And I imagine your offer is
free of any marriage demands?

371
00:28:23,409 --> 00:28:26,710
I never demand, but I'm
up for anything, really.

What if everyone starts
demanding their independence?

384
00:28:57,374 --> 00:28:59,508
She's not demanding, she's asking.
