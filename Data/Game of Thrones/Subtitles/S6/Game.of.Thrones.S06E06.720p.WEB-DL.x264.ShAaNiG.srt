Once you get south of the Riverlands,

45

00:06:40,864 --> 00:06:43,332
I didn't think
I'd ever come back here

54
00:06:43,434 --> 00:06:45,701
after my father made me
renounce my title

55

and inheritance

56
00:06:47,771 --> 00:06:50,205
and, well, threaten
to kill me if I didn't.

57
00:06:51,775 --> 00:06:54,142
A person just doesn't
feel welcome at that point.

58
00:06:56,213 --> 00:06:59,448
And I certainly didn't expect to
be introducing him to my family.

59
00:07:00,918 --> 00:07:03,385
So you know what to tell them.

60
00:07:03,487 --> 00:07:05,354
That Little Sam is your baby.

61
00:07:05,456 --> 00:07:07,022
Yes, now that's very important.

62
00:07:07,124 --> 00:07:09,624
If he thinks that
Little Sam is his grandchild,

63
00:07:09,727 --> 00:07:11,593
he'll take you in.

64
00:07:11,695 --> 00:07:15,097
He'll get an education.
He'll learn to read.

65
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,100
And you can help teach him. Huh?

66
00:07:18,202 --> 00:07:21,136
What did you tell
your family about me?

67
00:07:24,608 --> 00:07:27,009
I told them I met you in the North.

68
00:07:27,111 --> 00:07:28,977
Did you tell them how far north?

69
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:32,180
Well, it wasn't a very
large piece of parchment.

70
00:07:32,282 --> 00:07:33,962
You didn't tell them
where I'm really from?

71
00:07:34,051 --> 00:07:35,851
You didn't tell them I'm a wildling?

72
00:07:35,953 --> 00:07:38,053
The thing is...

73
00:07:38,155 --> 00:07:40,489
my father doesn't like wildlings.

74
00:07:40,591 --> 00:07:44,960
He hoped I'd make a man of myself
by "killing some bloody wildlings,"

75
00:07:45,062 --> 00:07:48,630
so it's probably a good subject
to avoid if at all possible.

171
00:13:37,647 --> 00:13:39,247
I love my brother.

172
00:13:39,349 --> 00:13:43,184
I will always love my brother.

173
00:13:43,286 --> 00:13:47,589
His soul is pure and perfect.

174
00:13:47,691 --> 00:13:50,191
His sins don't erase that purity,

175
00:13:50,293 --> 00:13:52,327
they only obscure it.

176
00:13:52,429 --> 00:13:56,831
He just needs to atone for them.

177
00:13:58,068 --> 00:13:59,367
We all do.

178
00:13:59,469 --> 00:14:02,670

193
00:15:41,137 --> 00:15:42,737
One shot.

194

Oh, that's a fair distance.

195
00:15:46,376 --> 00:15:49,244
So do you do much hunting
up at the Wall?

196
00:15:49,346 --> 00:15:52,013
Oh, yes.
Yes.

197
00:15:52,115 --> 00:15:53,681
A good amount.

Mm-hmm.

201
00:16:00,323 --> 00:16:02,190
Mostly deer or is it elk as well?

202
00:16:03,693 --> 00:16:05,894
Rabbits.

203
00:16:05,996 --> 00:16:08,263
<i>Sometimes squirrels.</i>

204
00:16:11,468 --> 00:16:15,270

Sometimes Edd.

207
00:16:19,042 --> 00:16:22,010

a good hunter as well.

Yes.

224
00:17:22,038 --> 00:17:23,805
And once I have my chain,

225
00:17:23,907 --> 00:17:26,407
I'll return to Castle Black.

226
00:17:26,509 --> 00:17:29,711
I thought the Night's Watch
might make a man of you.

227
00:17:31,314 --> 00:17:33,514
Something resembling a man at least.

228
00:17:34,918 --> 00:17:38,453
You managed to stay soft and fat.

229

Your nose buried in books.

230
00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:47,495
Spending your life reading about
the achievements of better men.

231
00:17:47,597 --> 00:17:51,065
I'll wager you still can't sit
a horse or wield a sword.

232
00:17:51,167 --> 00:17:54,268
Randyll, to be maester of the
Night's Watch is a great honor.

233
00:17:54,371 --> 00:17:56,704
He can wield a sword.

234
00:17:58,074 --> 00:18:00,141
He killed a Thenn.

235
00:18:01,978 --> 00:18:03,378
He killed a white walker.

236

<font color="#D900D9">(LAUGHS)</font>
There's no such thing.

I saw it with my own eyes on

238
00:18:12,122 --> 00:18:15,757
He drove a dagger
into the walker's heart.

239
00:18:15,859 --> 00:18:19,360
He risked his own life
to save mine more than once.

240
00:18:19,462 --> 00:18:23,064
He's a greater warrior than
either of you will ever be.

241
00:18:25,402 --> 00:18:28,403
Your way down to Castle Black?

00:18:31,307 --> 00:18:33,474
<i>Where did he kill a white walker?</i>

The Night's Watch came to our keep.

246
00:18:45,221 --> 00:18:47,221
- Where?
- Gilly.

247
00:18:47,323 --> 00:18:49,490
- North of the Wall.

See that sword?

253
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:23,791
It's called Heartsbane.

254
00:19:23,893 --> 00:19:27,595
It's been in our family
for 500 years.

255

<i>It's Valyrian steel.</i>

<i>Only a handful of them
left in the world.</i>

257
00:19:32,435 --> 00:19:36,304
It's supposed to go to my
firstborn son after I die.

258
00:19:36,406 --> 00:19:38,039
To him.

259
00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:42,710
He will never wield that sword.

260
00:19:42,812 --> 00:19:46,914
If he were to become
Lord Tarly of Horn Hill,

261
00:19:47,016 --> 00:19:49,317
it would be the end of this house.

262
00:19:51,988 --> 00:19:54,956
I took you for a Mole's
Town whore when I saw you

263

269
00:20:17,814 --> 00:20:21,883
Hmm? Bringing that to my table
and making me dine with it?

270
00:20:24,354 --> 00:20:26,788
<i>And you got what you
were after, didn't you?</i>

271
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:31,159

You're not worthy of her.

278
00:20:54,651 --> 00:20:59,053
To please her, I'll take the wildling in.
She can work in the kitchens.

279
00:20:59,155 --> 00:21:02,156

on this matter is final.

512
00:38:45,587 --> 00:38:48,521
Will I be walking naked
in the streets?

513
00:38:48,624 --> 00:38:51,124
Or will I spend a few months
in the sept dungeons first

514
00:38:51,226 --> 00:38:53,360
to teach me about the gods' mercy?

515
00:38:57,566 --> 00:39:01,868
You have served your house and your
king faithfully for many years.

516
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:04,204
And you will continue to do so.

517
00:39:05,974 --> 00:39:07,908
But not in this city.

518
00:39:11,179 --> 00:39:14,547
You've lost it?

519
00:39:16,285 --> 00:39:17,584
<font color="#808080">BLACK WALDER:</font>
Yes, Father.

520
00:39:17,686 --> 00:39:20,620
It's a castle, not a bloody sheep.

521
00:39:20,722 --> 00:39:23,890
Presumably you still
know where it is.

522
00:39:23,992 --> 00:39:25,592
You didn't lose Riverrun.

523
00:39:25,694 --> 00:39:27,827
You let the Blackfish
take it from you.

524
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:30,897
He surprised us. He knows the
castle better than anyone.

525
00:39:30,999 --> 00:39:34,367
You did lose the Blackfish
after the Red Wedding.

526
00:39:34,469 --> 00:39:37,470
You had him right here in this
hall and you let him leave.

527
00:39:37,572 --> 00:39:40,073
Then when I told you to
hunt him down and kill him,

528
00:39:40,175 --> 00:39:41,541
you couldn't find him.

529
00:39:41,643 --> 00:39:43,743
That's what it means
to lose something.

530
00:39:43,845 --> 00:39:47,280
Now he's come back
and taken Riverrun.

531
00:39:47,382 --> 00:39:49,549
I don't think it's fair
to blame us--

532
00:39:49,651 --> 00:39:52,919
For 300 years we kissed Tully boots,

533
00:39:53,021 --> 00:39:56,923
swore oaths to them and their
stinking fish banners.

534
00:39:57,025 --> 00:39:59,259
Not again.
Riverrun is ours.

535
00:39:59,361 --> 00:40:01,695
Take it back.

536
00:40:01,797 --> 00:40:03,330
We don't have the men.

537
00:40:03,432 --> 00:40:06,766
We've got 10 times as many
men as the damn Blackfish.

543

They're laughing at us.

544
00:40:23,785 --> 00:40:25,652
All across the Riverlands

00:40:25,754 --> 00:40:27,487

I'm not dead yet,
unfortunately for you.

549
00:40:35,063 --> 00:40:39,799
And I'll not leave this world until
they all choke on that laughter.

550
00:40:39,901 --> 00:40:42,435
Take that castle back.

Oh, he'll yield.

553
00:40:53,515 --> 00:40:56,249
You'll show him the knife you used

554

to kill Robb Stark's child
in his whore mother's belly,

555
00:41:00,155 --> 00:41:02,422

can't manage it on his own

We should treat them
without mercy and we will.

582
00:42:22,104 --> 00:42:24,938
But if you kill the High Sparrow,
you won't leave the sept alive.

583
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,074
And without you,
this is all for nothing.

594

They've made us both
stronger, all of them.

595

said you had been
lost beyond the Wall.

deep into the North

A white walker stabbed me in
the gut with a sword of ice.

616
00:45:00,395 --> 00:45:02,061
Left me there to die.

617
00:45:02,163 --> 00:45:03,563
To turn.

Stopped the walker's
magic from taking hold.

How?

00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:13,339
The same way they made the
walkers in the first place.

622
00:45:13,441 --> 00:45:14,774
You saw it yourself.
