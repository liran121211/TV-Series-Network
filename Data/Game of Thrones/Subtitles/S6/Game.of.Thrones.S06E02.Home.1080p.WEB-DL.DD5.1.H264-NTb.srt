In truth, I fear that, too.

172
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:58,115
You imprisoned
and humiliated my sister.

173
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:01,084
Your sister sought the gods' mercy

174
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:03,053
and atoned for her sin.

175
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:05,889
What about my sins?

176
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:11,528
I broke a sacred oath and
stabbed my king in the back.

177
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:15,132
I killed my own cousin.

178
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:17,201
When the gods judged
my brother guilty,

179
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:20,337
I helped him escape their justice.

180
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:24,541
What atonement do I deserve?

181
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:28,612

in this holy place?

182

Oh, the gods won't mind.

183

than the rest of us combined.

We all do.

00:43:47,558 --> 00:43:48,857
Perhaps you'll win.

509
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:53,629
Perhaps you'll be the first woman
in history to rule the ironborn.

510
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,665
And perhaps not.

511

<font color="#D900D9">(KNOCKS)</font>

512
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:15,150
Come in.

513
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:24,526
I'm sorry, my lady.
Didn't mean to interrupt.

514
00:44:24,528 --> 00:44:27,129
You interrupt nothing.

515
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:42,010
I assume you know why I'm here.

516
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:44,079
I will after you tell me.

517
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:46,582
It's about the Lord Commander.

518
00:44:46,584 --> 00:44:49,518
The former Lord Commander.

519
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:52,621
Does he have to be?

520
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:58,193
What are you asking?

521
00:45:01,499 --> 00:45:05,968
Do you know of any magic...

522
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:08,871
that could help him?

523
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:09,938
Bring him back?

524
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:13,041
If you want to help him,
leave him be.

525
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:15,010
Can it be done?

526
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:17,813
There are some with this power.

527
00:45:17,815 --> 00:45:20,616
- <i>How?</i>
- I don't know.

528
00:45:20,618 --> 00:45:22,184
Have you seen it done?

529
00:45:24,588 --> 00:45:27,289
I met a man who came
back from the dead,

530
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:30,292
but the priest
who did it--

531
00:45:30,294 --> 00:45:32,561
it shouldn't have been possible.

532
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:36,031
But it was.
It could be now.

533
00:45:36,033 --> 00:45:38,867
Not for me.

534
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:45,040
Not for you?

535
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:51,280
I saw you drink poison that
should have killed you.

536
00:45:51,282 --> 00:45:55,050
I saw you give birth
to a demon made of shadows.

537
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:57,553
Everything I believed,

538
00:45:57,555 --> 00:46:01,256
the great victory
I saw in the flames,

539
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:03,592
all of it was a lie.

540
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:09,131
You were right all along.

541
00:46:09,133 --> 00:46:12,167
The Lord never spoke to me.

542
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:14,169
Fuck him, then.

543
00:46:14,171 --> 00:46:16,772
Fuck all of them.

544
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:20,976
I'm not a devout man, obviously.

545
00:46:20,978 --> 00:46:25,681
Seven gods, drowned gods,
tree gods, it's all the same.

546
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:30,285
I'm not asking the Lord
of Light for help.

547
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:36,058
I'm asking the woman who
showed me that miracles exist.

548
00:46:37,328 --> 00:46:39,795
I never had this gift.

549
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:42,230
Have you ever tried?
