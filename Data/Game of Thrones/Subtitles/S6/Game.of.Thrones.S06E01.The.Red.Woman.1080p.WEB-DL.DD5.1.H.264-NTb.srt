Thorne did this.

21
00:04:53,405 --> 00:04:56,623
How many of your brothers
do you think you can trust?

22
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,324
Trust?

23
00:05:01,546 --> 00:05:02,796
The men in this room.

24
00:05:04,132 --> 00:05:06,750
Davos:
Does the wolf know you?

25
00:05:06,835 --> 00:05:08,835

Melisandre:
<i>I saw him in the flames</i>

30
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,307
fighting at Winterfell.

31
00:06:08,313 --> 00:06:10,480
I can't speak for the flames...

32
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,200
but he's gone.

<i>(men murmuring)</i>

39
00:06:46,935 --> 00:06:49,485
Jon Snow is dead.

40
00:06:49,604 --> 00:06:50,770
Who killed him?

41
00:06:52,023 --> 00:06:53,740
- I did.
- (shouting resumes)

42
00:06:53,825 --> 00:06:56,109
And Bowen Marsh and Othell Yarwyck

43
00:06:56,194 --> 00:06:58,494
and the other officers
in this castle.

44
00:06:58,613 --> 00:07:00,280
- Murderers!
- Traitors!

45
00:07:00,365 --> 00:07:04,033
- <i>(men shouting)</i>
- (pounds on table)

46
00:07:04,119 --> 00:07:06,336
- You're right!
- (shouting stops)

47
00:07:06,454 --> 00:07:08,671
<i>We've committed treason, all of us.</i>

48
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:11,875
Jon Snow was my Lord Commander.

49
00:07:13,044 --> 00:07:14,677
I had no love for him.

50
00:07:14,796 --> 00:07:17,130
That was no secret.

51
00:07:17,265 --> 00:07:21,467
But I never once disobeyed an order.

52
00:07:21,553 --> 00:07:23,970
Loyalty is the foundation

53
00:07:24,105 --> 00:07:26,105
on which the Night's Watch is built.

54
00:07:26,191 --> 00:07:28,558
And the Watch means everything to me.

55
00:07:28,643 --> 00:07:30,610
I have given my life,

56
00:07:30,695 --> 00:07:34,814
we have all given our lives
to the Night's Watch.

57
00:07:37,202 --> 00:07:41,704
Jon Snow was going to
destroy the Night's Watch.

58
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:44,407
<i>He let the wildlings
through our gates</i>

59
00:07:44,492 --> 00:07:47,961
as no Lord Commander
has ever done before.

60
00:07:48,046 --> 00:07:52,832
He gave them the very land
on which they reaved

61
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:56,669
and raped and murdered.

62
00:07:56,805 --> 00:08:01,007
Lord Commander Snow did
what he thought was right,

63
00:08:01,092 --> 00:08:04,010
I've no doubt about that.

64
00:08:04,145 --> 00:08:08,314
And what he thought was right
would have been the end of us.

65
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,601
He thrust a terrible choice upon us.

66
00:08:12,771 --> 00:08:14,854
And we made it.

67
00:08:18,743 --> 00:08:20,693
(men murmuring)

68
00:08:25,033 --> 00:08:26,532
(whimpering)

69
00:08:26,618 --> 00:08:28,868
Davos: <i>He'll have
seen we didn't come.</i>

70
00:08:28,954 --> 00:08:31,037
Thorne will have
made it official by now.

71
00:08:31,172 --> 00:08:32,622
Castle Black is his.

72
00:08:32,707 --> 00:08:35,875
I don't care who's sitting
at the high table.

73
00:08:35,961 --> 00:08:37,543
Jon was my friend.

74
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,847
And those fuckers butchered him.

75
00:08:40,932 --> 00:08:43,383
Now we return the favor.

76
00:08:43,468 --> 00:08:44,884
We don't have the numbers.

77
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,936
- We have a direwolf.
- It's not enough.

78
00:08:47,055 --> 00:08:49,055
<i>I didn't know Lord
Commander Snow for long,</i>

79
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,358
but I have to believe he wouldn't have
wanted his friends to die for nothing.

80
00:08:52,444 --> 00:08:56,946
If you were planning to see tomorrow,
you picked the wrong room.

81
00:08:57,065 --> 00:08:59,232
We all die today.

82
00:08:59,367 --> 00:09:02,035
I say we do our best to take
Thorne with us when we go.

83
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,538
We need to fight,
but we don't need to die.

84
00:09:05,623 --> 00:09:08,041
- Not if we have help.
- Who is gonna help us?

85
00:09:08,126 --> 00:09:11,494
You're not the only ones who
owe your lives to Jon Snow.

86
00:09:19,721 --> 00:09:21,421
Bolt the door.

87
00:09:21,506 --> 00:09:23,423
Don't let anyone in.

88
00:09:23,508 --> 00:09:25,591
I'll be back as soon as I can.

89
00:09:29,347 --> 00:09:30,763
<i>(door closes)</i>

90
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:32,598

(wind howling)

92
00:09:35,603 --> 00:09:38,855
Ramsay: <i>She was 11 the
first time I saw her.</i>

93
00:09:40,825 --> 00:09:43,609
The kennelmaster's daughter.

94
00:09:45,914 --> 00:09:48,031
She smelled of dog.

95
00:09:51,169 --> 00:09:54,954
I wasn't much older, but everybody
was already afraid of me.

96
00:09:56,591 --> 00:09:58,624
You certainly were.

97
00:10:04,049 --> 00:10:05,631
Myranda wasn't, though.

98
00:10:05,717 --> 00:10:09,602
What could I do to her
that those hounds couldn't?

99
00:10:09,687 --> 00:10:11,554
She was fearless.

100
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:14,307
There was nothing she wouldn't do.

101
00:10:19,981 --> 00:10:23,816
Your pain will be paid for
a thousand times over.

102
00:10:26,821 --> 00:10:29,489
I wish you could be here to watch.

103
00:10:33,995 --> 00:10:37,413
Maester: <i>Shall I have a
grave dug for her, my lord?</i>

104
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,918
<i>Or would you rather
the men build a pyre?</i>

105
00:10:46,758 --> 00:10:49,058
Buried, burned?

106
00:10:49,177 --> 00:10:50,810
This is good meat.

107
00:10:50,895 --> 00:10:52,345
Feed it to the hounds.

108
00:10:54,349 --> 00:10:57,066
Roose: Your command of the
cavalry was impressive.

109
00:10:57,185 --> 00:11:00,069
Thanks to you, the false king
Stannis Baratheon is dead.

110
00:11:00,188 --> 00:11:02,822
Do you know who struck
the killing blow?

111
00:11:02,907 --> 00:11:04,907
- No.
- A shame.

112
00:11:05,026 --> 00:11:06,909
I'd reward the man.

113
00:11:07,028 --> 00:11:10,329
Still, a great victory.

114
00:11:10,415 --> 00:11:12,448
Do you feel like a victor?

115
00:11:17,539 --> 00:11:19,422
I rebelled against the crown

116
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,591
to arrange your marriage
to Sansa Stark.

117
00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:24,210
Do you think that
burning wagons in the night

118
00:11:24,345 --> 00:11:26,546
and mowing down tired,
outnumbered Baratheons

119
00:11:26,681 --> 00:11:29,966
is the same as facing a prepared
and provisioned Lannister army?

120
00:11:33,138 --> 00:11:34,470
No.

121
00:11:36,357 --> 00:11:38,057
A reckoning will come.

122
00:11:38,193 --> 00:11:39,775
We need the North to face it.

123
00:11:39,894 --> 00:11:41,727
The entire North.

124
00:11:41,863 --> 00:11:45,064
They won't back us
without Sansa Stark.

125
00:11:46,401 --> 00:11:48,818
We no longer have Sansa Stark.

126
00:11:48,903 --> 00:11:51,120
You played your games with her.

127
00:11:51,239 --> 00:11:54,740
You played your games with the heir to the
Iron Islands and now they're both gone.

128
00:11:54,826 --> 00:11:57,743
I have a team of men after them
with some of my best hounds.

129
00:11:57,829 --> 00:11:59,378
<i>They won't get far.</i>

130
00:11:59,464 --> 00:12:01,464
I'm glad to hear it.

131
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:04,884
Without Sansa, you won't be
able to produce an heir.

132
00:12:04,969 --> 00:12:08,054
And without an heir, well...

133
00:12:10,975 --> 00:12:13,226
let's hope the maesters are right

134
00:12:13,311 --> 00:12:15,228
and Lady Walda's carrying a boy.

<i>(barking continues)</i>

00:12:56,304 --> 00:12:57,803
We have to cross here.

141
00:13:00,808 --> 00:13:03,392
- (gasps) I can't.
- It's the only way to throw off the hounds.

142
00:13:03,478 --> 00:13:06,028
But it's too cold. I can't.
I won't make it. I'll die.

143
00:13:06,147 --> 00:13:08,648
I've seen what his hounds
do to a person.

144
00:13:08,733 --> 00:13:10,733
This way is better.

Sansa.

Sansa.

Stay here.

No, I won't make it without you.

00:14:32,033 --> 00:14:33,733
You will.

158
00:14:33,818 --> 00:14:36,068
Go north, only north.

159
00:14:36,154 --> 00:14:37,987
Jon is Lord Commander
at Castle Black.

160
00:14:38,072 --> 00:14:39,739
He'll help you.

Where is Lady Bolton?

166

- Dead.
- Liar.

00:17:54,068 --> 00:17:57,520
Lady Sansa, I offer
my services once again.

199
00:17:59,106 --> 00:18:01,273
I will shield your back
and keep your counsel

200
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:03,609
and give my life
for yours if need be.

201
00:18:05,112 --> 00:18:07,279
I swear it by the old
gods and the new.

202
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,091
And I vow...

203
00:18:20,878 --> 00:18:24,296

...meat and mead

207

And I pledge to ask no service of you

208
00:18:39,647 --> 00:18:42,147
that might bring you dishonor.

Handmaiden: <i>Your Grace,
I'm sorry to disturb you.</i>

214
00:19:37,254 --> 00:19:39,838
A ship from Dorne
has sailed into the harbor.

215
00:19:41,175 --> 00:19:42,958
Myrcella.

Do you remember the first
time you saw a dead body?

219
00:21:00,371 --> 00:21:01,954
Mother.

220
00:21:04,258 --> 00:21:05,958
All I could think about when she died

221
00:21:06,093 --> 00:21:08,260
was what would happen to her now.

222
00:21:11,882 --> 00:21:14,883
Every day, every night,

223
00:21:14,969 --> 00:21:17,302
what does Mama look like now?

224
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:21,940
Has she started to bloat?

225
00:21:23,477 --> 00:21:25,978
Has her skin turned black?

226
00:21:27,481 --> 00:21:30,149
Have her lips peeled
back from her teeth?

227
00:21:35,122 --> 00:21:37,990
I think about locking
Myrcella in a crypt.

228
00:21:39,827 --> 00:21:42,377
I think about her beautiful
little face starting to collapse.

229
00:21:42,496 --> 00:21:45,664
Shh, shh.
Don't think about it.

230
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,466
I have to.

231
00:21:49,503 --> 00:21:51,637
I have to. It's not right
she has to suffer alone.

232
00:21:51,722 --> 00:21:54,973
She's not suffering.
She's gone.

233
00:21:55,059 --> 00:21:57,926
No one can hurt her anymore.

234
00:21:59,513 --> 00:22:01,313
She was good.

235
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:05,601
From her first breath,
she was so sweet.

236
00:22:07,354 --> 00:22:09,354
I don't know where she came from.

237
00:22:11,358 --> 00:22:14,359
She was nothing like me.

238
00:22:14,445 --> 00:22:16,912
No meanness, no jealousy, just good.

239
00:22:17,031 --> 00:22:18,697
I know.

240
00:22:18,783 --> 00:22:23,035
<i>I thought if I could
make something so good,</i>

241
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,704
so pure...

242
00:22:28,042 --> 00:22:31,043
- maybe I'm not a monster.
- <i>Listen-- listen to me.</i>

243
00:22:31,128 --> 00:22:33,679
She was my daughter and I failed her.

244
00:22:33,764 --> 00:22:36,265
No, I knew this would happen.

245
00:22:36,383 --> 00:22:38,517
The witch told me years ago.

246
00:22:40,437 --> 00:22:43,555
She promised me three children
and she promised me they'd die.

247
00:22:43,641 --> 00:22:46,225
"And gold their shrouds."

248
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,893
Everything she said came true.

249
00:22:47,978 --> 00:22:49,728
You couldn't have stopped it.

250
00:22:49,864 --> 00:22:51,480
It's prophecy.
It's fate.

251
00:22:51,565 --> 00:22:54,566
- You don't believe that.
- Of course I do.

252
00:22:54,652 --> 00:22:57,820
You told me yourself
when Father died.

253
00:22:57,905 --> 00:22:59,788
You said we had to stay together.

254
00:22:59,907 --> 00:23:03,125
You said people would try to
tear us apart, take what's ours.

255
00:23:03,244 --> 00:23:04,743
That was a prophecy, too.

256
00:23:04,879 --> 00:23:07,129
I didn't listen to you and
everything you said came true.

257
00:23:07,248 --> 00:23:09,665
Fuck prophecy.
Fuck fate.

258
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:12,134
Fuck everyone who isn't us.

259
00:23:12,253 --> 00:23:13,752
We're the only ones who matter,

260
00:23:13,888 --> 00:23:15,971
the only ones in this world.

261
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:17,530
And everything they've taken from us,

262
00:23:17,558 --> 00:23:19,675
we're going to take back and more.

263
00:23:22,263 --> 00:23:24,930
We're going to take
everything there is.

264
00:23:32,072 --> 00:23:35,908
"The Seven Hells brim
with the souls of saintly men.

265
00:23:35,993 --> 00:23:38,827
They scream in agony
and their shame is so great,

266
00:23:38,946 --> 00:23:40,913
they do not feel the flames,

267
00:23:40,998 --> 00:23:43,916
for now they see

268
00:23:44,001 --> 00:23:46,752
they concealed,
they were saved."

269
00:23:46,837 --> 00:23:48,754
I'd like to see my brother.

270
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:51,123
- Confess.
- Please.

271
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:53,208
How is he?
At least tell me that.

272
00:23:53,294 --> 00:23:54,626
Confess.

273
00:23:58,299 --> 00:24:00,799
I am the queen and I
demand to see my brother.

274
00:24:00,885 --> 00:24:02,885
<i>Sinners don't make demands.</i>

275
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:05,687
They make confessions.

(sighs) Our other guests need you.

280
00:24:25,576 --> 00:24:27,659
- (gasps)
- There.

281
00:24:29,246 --> 00:24:32,497
Septa Unella can be
overzealous at times.

282
00:24:32,633 --> 00:24:33,999
I'll speak with her.

283
00:24:35,636 --> 00:24:38,804
My brother, can you
tell me how he is?

284
00:24:40,557 --> 00:24:44,509
It isn't Ser Loras
that brings me here.

285
00:24:45,846 --> 00:24:47,679
Your husband misses you dearly.

286
00:24:47,815 --> 00:24:51,817
The love between a man
and wife is sacred.

287
00:24:51,902 --> 00:24:55,070
It reflects the love
the gods have for all of us.

288
00:24:55,189 --> 00:24:59,658
But sin leads us away
from the sacred.

289
00:24:59,743 --> 00:25:02,577
And only confession can purge sin.

290
00:25:02,696 --> 00:25:05,364
I have nothing to confess.

291
00:25:05,499 --> 00:25:10,085
So you believe you are pure?

292
00:25:10,204 --> 00:25:12,037
Perfect?

293
00:25:12,122 --> 00:25:14,506
Wholly without sin?

294
00:25:15,843 --> 00:25:17,209
None of us are.

295
00:25:19,213 --> 00:25:21,964
You have started down the path.

296
00:25:23,467 --> 00:25:25,550

He lived.

300
00:25:44,071 --> 00:25:45,654
He truly lived.

301
00:25:45,739 --> 00:25:47,572
Sailed around the world.

302
00:25:47,708 --> 00:25:49,574
Fought men from every country.

303
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:52,077
Lay with the most
beautiful women alive.

304
00:25:52,212 --> 00:25:54,246
- And men.
- And men.

305
00:25:54,331 --> 00:25:56,915
He experienced everything

people alive and well fed.

308
00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:06,758
But that is life.

We each have our roles.

310
00:26:10,597 --> 00:26:15,350
Oberyn was born to be an adventurer.

311
00:26:15,436 --> 00:26:17,319
And I was born to rule.

312
00:26:17,438 --> 00:26:19,187
The gods are not fools.

313
00:26:19,273 --> 00:26:22,157
You would have been
a lousy adventurer.

314
00:26:22,276 --> 00:26:24,743
And Oberyn, pfft,

315
00:26:24,828 --> 00:26:26,528
he would have been a terrible ruler.

316
00:26:26,613 --> 00:26:29,998
Your mother is a brilliant
woman, you know that?

<i>Prince Doran.</i>

you left this palace?

321

<i>- Their disgust for you.

Elia Martell raped and
murdered, and you did nothing.

Oberyn Martell butchered,
and you did nothing.

325
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:25,637
You're not a Dornishman.

Your son is weak just like you.

330
00:27:38,502 --> 00:27:42,587
And weak men will never
rule Dorne again.

331

You.

You've spent a lot of time

00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:01,867
_

359
00:30:08,602 --> 00:30:10,101
(speaks Valyrian)

360
00:30:14,942 --> 00:30:18,443
- Varys: Mhysa means mother in Valyrian.
- <i>I know what mhysa means.</i>

361
00:30:18,528 --> 00:30:20,412
- Varys: Who wrote it?
- Hard to know.

362
00:30:20,497 --> 00:30:24,032
Our queen is not as popular
in Meereen as she used to be.

363
00:30:24,117 --> 00:30:25,867
The Sons of the Harpy?

364
00:30:25,953 --> 00:30:27,535
Very possibly.

365
00:30:29,373 --> 00:30:32,340
Daenerys Targaryen took away
their most valuable property,

366
00:30:32,459 --> 00:30:36,378
told them human beings weren't
even property to begin with.

367
00:30:36,463 --> 00:30:38,630
You can see why they're unhappy.

368
00:30:38,765 --> 00:30:41,016
Of course,

369
00:30:41,134 --> 00:30:43,802
it could also be the freed men.

370
00:30:43,937 --> 00:30:47,305
_

371
00:30:47,391 --> 00:30:51,643
_

372
00:30:52,109 --> 00:30:54,847
_

373
00:30:55,115 --> 00:30:58,700
Many of the former slaves feel
that Daenerys has abandoned them.

374
00:30:59,396 --> 00:31:02,053
She did fly away on a
dragon and not come back.

375
00:31:02,574 --> 00:31:04,540
_

376
00:31:05,407 --> 00:31:10,439
_

377
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:14,307
_

378
00:31:14,427 --> 00:31:19,169
_

379
00:31:19,289 --> 00:31:21,707
It's a problem.

380
00:31:23,677 --> 00:31:26,378
Fear has brought Meereen
to a standstill.

381
00:31:28,382 --> 00:31:30,599
Whoever you are, wherever you go,

382
00:31:30,718 --> 00:31:33,885
someone in this city
wants to murder you.

383
00:31:33,971 --> 00:31:36,972
We can't fight
an enemy we don't know.

384
00:31:37,605 --> 00:31:40,489
The Sons of the Harpy
planned their attack

385
00:31:40,608 --> 00:31:42,441
in the fighting pits very carefully,

386
00:31:42,527 --> 00:31:45,194
which means they take
orders from someone.

387
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,413
And have you started
looking for that someone?

388
00:31:47,498 --> 00:31:50,283
My little birds
have already taken wing.

389
00:31:50,418 --> 00:31:54,870
Soon they'll return, singing
songs of men in gold masks.

390
00:31:54,956 --> 00:31:58,758
<i>(men shouting in Valyrian)</i>

391
00:31:58,843 --> 00:32:01,294
- (people shouting)
- <i>(bell tolling)</i>

392
00:32:16,144 --> 00:32:18,728
- (shouting continues)
- <i>(bell continues tolling)</i>

393
00:32:28,956 --> 00:32:33,743
Well, we won't be sailing
to Westeros anytime soon.

394
00:32:55,483 --> 00:32:57,366
Goat?

395
00:32:57,485 --> 00:32:59,068
Ram.

396
00:32:59,154 --> 00:33:00,820
You think our friend got him?

397
00:33:02,457 --> 00:33:05,241
Don't know anything else
that can melt a ram's horn.

398
00:33:07,295 --> 00:33:09,495
We're on the right path, then.

399
00:33:09,631 --> 00:33:12,715
Daario: Perhaps she's
tired of being queen.

400
00:33:12,834 --> 00:33:14,884
I don't think she likes it very much.

401
00:33:15,003 --> 00:33:17,170
She's too smart to like it.

402
00:33:17,305 --> 00:33:19,088
Maybe she's flown somewhere else,

403
00:33:19,174 --> 00:33:21,174
somewhere far away from men like us.

404
00:33:21,259 --> 00:33:24,093
I've been all over the world.

405
00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:26,095
There's no escaping men like us.

406
00:33:26,181 --> 00:33:28,898
There's no escaping her, eh?

407
00:33:29,017 --> 00:33:32,185
You keep coming back.
Why?

408
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,769
You know why.

409
00:33:35,823 --> 00:33:37,857
Isn't it frustrating

410
00:33:37,992 --> 00:33:41,360
wanting someone
who doesn't want you back?

411
00:33:41,496 --> 00:33:42,912
Of course it is.

412
00:33:43,031 --> 00:33:45,581
You're a romantic.
I admire that.

413
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,667
Sometimes I look at you and I think,

414
00:33:47,752 --> 00:33:50,086
"So that's what I'll be like
when I grow old."

415
00:33:50,205 --> 00:33:51,871
If you grow old.

416
00:33:51,956 --> 00:33:53,206
If I grow old.

417
00:33:53,341 --> 00:33:55,508
I hope I do.

418
00:33:55,593 --> 00:33:57,343
I want to see what
the world looks like

419
00:33:57,428 --> 00:33:59,045
when she's done conquering it.

420
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,180
So do I.

421
00:34:20,868 --> 00:34:23,653
Daario:
Huh, an army?

422
00:34:23,738 --> 00:34:25,154
Not an army.

423
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,989
A horde.

424
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:53,849
Dothraki?

425
00:35:17,208 --> 00:35:18,958
They have her.

426
00:35:34,475 --> 00:35:37,476

427
00:35:58,966 --> 00:36:01,250

allow you to travel south</i>

In my learned opinion,
we open that door--

546
00:45:33,824 --> 00:45:35,290
And they'll slaughter us all.

547
00:45:35,409 --> 00:45:37,709
They want to come in,
they're gonna come in.

548
00:45:37,795 --> 00:45:41,296
- Aye, but we don't need to make it
easy for them. - <i>Edd is our only chance.</i>

549
00:45:41,415 --> 00:45:44,750
It's a sad fucking statement if
Dolorous Edd is our only chance.

550
00:45:46,754 --> 00:45:48,253
There's always the Red Woman.

551
00:45:48,278 --> 00:45:50,945
What's one redhead gonna do
against 40 armed men?

552
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,697
You haven't seen her do
what I've seen her do.
