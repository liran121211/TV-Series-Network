26
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,396

27
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,735

You fight for as long as you can.

38
00:05:26,401 --> 00:05:29,268

79

80
00:09:27,642 --> 00:09:30,676

you there or for Little Sam.

81

99
00:10:36,411 --> 00:10:39,962

help Jon when the time comes

00:23:14,451 --> 00:23:17,012
You've sacrificed
your body for a cause,

236
00:23:17,037 --> 00:23:20,372
which is more than most people do.

237
00:23:20,517 --> 00:23:23,635
And you've helped
the Sons of the Harpy

238
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:26,522
murder the Unsullied
and the Second Sons.

239
00:23:26,547 --> 00:23:29,881
The Unsullied and the Second

244
00:23:40,594 --> 00:23:43,345
from your perspective.

245
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:47,232
I have a different
perspective, of course.

246
00:23:47,317 --> 00:23:50,769
I think it's important that you try
to see things from my perspective

247
00:23:50,904 --> 00:23:53,271
just as I will try
to see them from yours.

248
00:23:53,357 --> 00:23:55,574
Because that is the only way

249
00:23:55,659 --> 00:23:58,577
that I can make you and Dom happy.

250
00:24:01,665 --> 00:24:05,450
That is how
you pronounce it-- Dom?

251

I'm afraid I don't really
speak the language.

252
00:24:10,124 --> 00:24:12,007

00:24:12,126 --> 00:24:15,627

luck keeping the ladies away.

Yes, you're a true
liberator, aren't you?

255
00:24:19,967 --> 00:24:22,851
You won't torture me,
you'll just threaten my son.

256
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:25,387
Children are blameless.

257
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,640
I have never hurt them.

258
00:24:28,725 --> 00:24:31,059

259
00:24:31,145 --> 00:24:32,727
this I swear to you.

260
00:24:34,698 --> 00:24:36,615
But between us, dear,

261
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,818
you did conspire to kill
the queen's soldiers.

262
00:24:39,953 --> 00:24:42,487
We both know the penalty
for that crime.

263
00:24:47,628 --> 00:24:51,296
How will poor Dom
get on without his mother?

264
00:24:51,381 --> 00:24:53,415
And with his breathing problem.

265
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,834
If I tell you anything,
they'll kill me.

266
00:24:55,969 --> 00:24:58,136
So either you kill me or they do.

267
00:24:58,222 --> 00:25:01,756
Yes, from your perspective,
this is a problem.

268
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:05,343
There is a third option, though.

269
00:25:05,429 --> 00:25:08,647
A ship leaving tomorrow for Pentos.

270
00:25:08,732 --> 00:25:13,351
I've already booked passage for
a woman and her young son.

271
00:25:13,487 --> 00:25:16,905
I'll even throw in a bag of
silver to help you start again.

272
00:25:17,024 --> 00:25:18,773
Though I'm afraid we'll have to ask

273
00:25:18,859 --> 00:25:22,577
one of our leather-clad
friends back in to carry it.

274
00:25:22,696 --> 00:25:24,362
Far too heavy for me.

275
00:25:25,749 --> 00:25:27,616
The boat sails at dawn.

276
00:25:27,701 --> 00:25:30,502
You need to decide now.

277
00:25:30,587 --> 00:25:33,371
A new life for you and Dom

278
00:25:33,457 --> 00:25:35,090
or...

279
00:25:51,141 --> 00:25:52,941
What should we do while we wait?

280
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,860
To pass the time, what should we do?

281
00:25:54,945 --> 00:25:57,279
<i>What should we talk about?</i>

282
00:25:59,616 --> 00:26:01,399
You speak 19 languages.

283
00:26:01,485 --> 00:26:04,819
You must occasionally use some
of them to talk about things.

284
00:26:04,905 --> 00:26:08,156
You two, you spend a great
deal of time together.

285
00:26:08,242 --> 00:26:11,409
What would you be talking
about if I weren't here?

286
00:26:12,496 --> 00:26:14,462
Patrol.

287
00:26:14,581 --> 00:26:17,215
When I am going on patrol
with the Unsullied.

288
00:26:17,301 --> 00:26:19,885
What we see on patrol.

289
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,920
Who we captured on patrol.

290
00:26:22,005 --> 00:26:24,472
That's good.
That's very good.

291
00:26:26,593 --> 00:26:28,977
But that's a report.

292
00:26:29,096 --> 00:26:31,263
I was thinking more
of a conversation.

293

A wise man once said the
true history of the world

294
00:26:34,518 --> 00:26:37,936
is the history of great
conversations in elegant rooms.

295
00:26:38,021 --> 00:26:39,938
Who said this?

296
00:26:40,023 --> 00:26:42,407
Me.

297
00:26:42,492 --> 00:26:44,442

No one's seen him.

357
00:29:15,812 --> 00:29:17,095
And no one will.

358
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,813
That worked out rather nicely.

359
00:29:18,932 --> 00:29:20,932
Will Lord Varys ever come back?

360

I don't think so.

Do you miss him?

362
00:29:25,105 --> 00:29:27,689
He was nice.

363
00:29:27,774 --> 00:29:30,108
He called us his little birds.

364
00:29:30,193 --> 00:29:31,776
He gave us sweets.

365
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:36,748
It's funny you should mention that.

366
00:29:38,502 --> 00:29:42,454
Guess what I happened to find today.

367
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:46,124
Candied plums from Dorne.

I haven't been able
to get a clear answer.

Oh, a number of things.

Does he understand what we're saying?

383
00:30:36,676 --> 00:30:38,927
I mean, to the extent
that he ever understood

384
00:30:39,012 --> 00:30:41,262
complete sentences
in the first place.

385
00:30:43,016 --> 00:30:45,150
He understands well enough.

386
00:30:45,235 --> 00:30:47,268
So tell him to march into the sept

The High Sparrow has hundreds of

Ser Gregor can't face them all.

390
00:30:55,946 --> 00:30:57,862
And he won't have to.

391

No.

00:34:45,308 --> 00:34:48,476

My mother who is unclean?

474

My mother who still needs to atone
after all you've put her through?

475
00:35:38,061 --> 00:35:41,362
How do you think the Mother
Above first came to us?

476
00:35:42,365 --> 00:35:44,148
How did men and women

477
00:35:44,284 --> 00:35:47,735
first come to feel
the Mother's presence, hmm?

478
00:35:49,155 --> 00:35:50,955
It was through their own mothers.

479
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:57,044
There's a great deal of falsehood
in Cersei. You know that.

480
00:35:57,163 --> 00:36:01,332
But when she speaks of you, the
Mother's love outshines it all.

481
00:36:03,386 --> 00:36:06,337
Her love for you is more real

482
00:36:06,422 --> 00:36:08,339
than anything else in this world

483
00:36:08,424 --> 00:36:11,425
because it doesn't
come from this world.

484
00:36:11,511 --> 00:36:13,478
But you know that.

485
00:36:13,563 --> 00:36:16,180
You've felt it.

486
00:36:16,266 --> 00:36:18,483
You've seen her
when she talks to you.

487
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:22,353
Yes.

When your mother
made her walk of atonement,

497
00:36:50,683 --> 00:36:52,884
she did it to get back to you.

498
00:36:52,969 --> 00:36:55,720
I still don't understand
why you want to put her

499
00:36:55,855 --> 00:36:57,605
through any more than
she's already endured.

500
00:36:57,724 --> 00:37:01,058

then we accept it,

A true leader avails himself
of the wisest counsel he can.

507

And no one is wiser than the gods.

508

My grandfather once said
something similar.

509

Except for the part about the gods.

510
00:37:36,145 --> 00:37:40,064
The gods worked through him
whether he knew it or not.

571

My beloved father,
the Warden--

573
00:43:29,782 --> 00:43:32,917
Your father was a cunt
and that's why you killed him.

<i>I might have done
the same to my father</i>

if he hadn't have done me

My father was poisoned

Mmm.

00:43:43,346 --> 00:43:46,630
Why have you come to
Winterfell, Lord Umber?

579
00:43:46,766 --> 00:43:50,601
The bastard Jon Snow led an army
of wildlings past the Wall.

580
00:43:50,686 --> 00:43:53,103
We're farther north
than any of you fuckers.

<i>Wildlings come down, we always
have to fight them first.</i>

582
00:43:56,559 --> 00:43:59,810
I like fighting wildlings.
Been doing it all my life.

583
00:43:59,895 --> 00:44:02,646
But there are too many of them
for us to beat back alone.

We need to help each other.

586

The colder it gets, the farther
south those goat fuckers will roam.

587
00:44:11,824 --> 00:44:13,791
Won't take them long to get here.

588
00:44:13,876 --> 00:44:16,710
You think a horde of wildlings
can take Winterfell?

589
00:44:16,829 --> 00:44:18,429
If they get Jon Snow
leading them, maybe.

Swear loyalty to me

to destroy the bastard

594

595
00:44:33,179 --> 00:44:35,346
I'm not kissing your fucking hand.

596
00:44:35,481 --> 00:44:38,065
Traditionally a bannerman
kneels before his lord.

597
00:44:38,184 --> 00:44:40,184
I'm not doing that either.

598
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:43,237
Why would I trust a man
who won't honor tradition?

599
00:44:43,356 --> 00:44:46,190
Your father honored tradition.

601
00:44:48,577 --> 00:44:50,995

at a bit of an impasse.

627

Betray you or betray
