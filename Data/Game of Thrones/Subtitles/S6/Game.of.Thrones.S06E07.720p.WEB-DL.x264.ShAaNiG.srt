but don't have a drop of the
Mother's mercy in their blood

75
00:07:36,455 --> 00:07:39,889

they know you're here.

173
00:13:11,956 --> 00:13:14,857
They know that more than half
of you are women and children.

174
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,593
After they finish with me,
they'll come for you.

175
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:20,329
<i>You're right.</i>

176
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:22,065
<i>This isn't your fight.</i>

177
00:13:22,167 --> 00:13:24,700
You shouldn't have to come
to Winterfell with me.

178
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:26,302
I shouldn't be asking you.

179
00:13:26,404 --> 00:13:28,171
It's not the deal we made.

180
00:13:29,774 --> 00:13:32,141
I need you with me
if we're going to beat them,

181
00:13:32,243 --> 00:13:35,344
and we need to beat them
if you're going to survive.

182
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:43,486
The crows killed him because
he spoke for the free folk

183
00:13:43,588 --> 00:13:45,588
when no other southerners would.

184
00:13:46,925 --> 00:13:49,358
He died for us.

185
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:53,863
If we are not willing to do the
same for him, we're cowards.

186
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,766
<i>And if that's what we are,</i>

187
00:13:56,868 --> 00:13:59,469

You're right.

I made a terrible mistake.

204
00:15:56,788 --> 00:15:58,554
I carry it with me every single day.

205
00:15:58,656 --> 00:16:00,156
Good.

206
00:16:00,258 --> 00:16:03,793
I delivered an army of
fanatics onto our doorstep.

207

And now we must fight them together.

208
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,433
We need each other.

209
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:15,838
I wonder if you're the worst
person I've ever met.

210
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:18,741
At a certain age,
it's hard to recall.

211
00:16:18,843 --> 00:16:23,446
But the truly vile do stand
out through the years.

212
00:16:23,548 --> 00:16:25,715
<i>Do you remember the way
you smirked at me</i>

213
00:16:25,817 --> 00:16:29,652
<i>when my grandson and granddaughter
were dragged off to their cells?</i>

214
00:16:29,754 --> 00:16:32,521
I do.
I'll never forget it.

215
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:34,357
You love your granddaughter.

216
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,426
<i>I love my son.</i>

217
00:16:37,528 --> 00:16:40,930
It's the only truth I know.

218
00:16:41,032 --> 00:16:43,032
We must defend them.

219
00:16:43,134 --> 00:16:46,402
I'm leaving this wretched
city as fast as I can

220
00:16:46,504 --> 00:16:50,573

throws me into one of his cells.

If you're half as bright
as you think you are,

222
00:16:52,744 --> 00:16:54,410
you'll find a way out of here, too.

223
00:16:54,512 --> 00:16:56,112
Never.

224
00:16:56,214 --> 00:16:57,613
I'll never leave my son.

225
00:16:57,715 --> 00:16:59,682
What'll you do, then?

00:16:59,784 --> 00:17:02,685
You have no support.
Not anymore.

227
00:17:02,787 --> 00:17:05,855
Your brother's gone. The

Why are you here?

00:24:57,044 --> 00:25:01,580
So why should I sacrifice one more
Mormont life for someone else's war?

340
00:25:07,421 --> 00:25:10,689
If it please, my lady,

341
00:25:10,791 --> 00:25:12,391
I understand how you feel.

342
00:25:12,493 --> 00:25:14,927
I don't know you, Ser...?

343
00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:17,029
Davos, my lady, of House Seaworth.

344
00:25:17,131 --> 00:25:19,731
<i>You needn't ask your
maester about my house.</i>

345
00:25:19,834 --> 00:25:22,167
It's rather new.

346
00:25:23,671 --> 00:25:26,238
All right, Ser Davos
of House Seaworth.

347
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,307
How is it you understand how I feel?

348
00:25:28,409 --> 00:25:33,145
You never thought you'd find
yourself in your position.

349
00:25:33,247 --> 00:25:36,782
Being responsible for so many
lives at such a young age.

350
00:25:36,884 --> 00:25:38,650
<i>I never thought
I'd be in my position.</i>

351
00:25:38,752 --> 00:25:42,888
I was a crabber's son,
then I was a smuggler.

352
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:45,057
And now I find myself
addressing the lady

353
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:47,326
of a great house in time of war.

354
00:25:47,428 --> 00:25:51,630
But I'm here because this
isn't someone else's war.

355
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,900
It's our war.

356
00:25:56,203 --> 00:25:57,970
Go on, Ser Davos.

357
00:25:59,807 --> 00:26:02,341
Your uncle, Lord Commander Mormont,

358
00:26:02,443 --> 00:26:04,343
made that man his steward.

359
00:26:04,445 --> 00:26:07,246
He chose Jon to be his
successor because he knew

360
00:26:07,348 --> 00:26:09,348
he had the courage
to do what was right,

361
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:12,384
<i>even if it meant giving his life.</i>

362
00:26:12,486 --> 00:26:16,421
Because Jeor Mormont
and Jon Snow both understood

363
00:26:16,524 --> 00:26:20,859
that the real war isn't between
a few squabbling houses.

364
00:26:20,961 --> 00:26:23,428
It's between the living and the dead.

365
00:26:24,832 --> 00:26:27,499
And make no mistake, my lady,

366
00:26:27,601 --> 00:26:29,568
the dead are coming.

367
00:26:31,238 --> 00:26:32,905
Is this true?

368
00:26:34,975 --> 00:26:37,609
Your uncle fought them
at the Fist of the First Men.

369
00:26:37,711 --> 00:26:39,411
<i>I fought them at Hardhome.</i>

370
00:26:39,513 --> 00:26:41,446
We both lost.

371
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:46,652
As long as the Boltons hold
Winterfell, the North is divided.

372
00:26:46,754 --> 00:26:50,556
And a divided North won't stand a
chance against the Night King.

373
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,194
You want to protect your people, my lady.
I understand.

374
00:26:55,296 --> 00:26:57,196
<i>But there's no hiding from this.</i>

375
00:26:57,298 --> 00:27:01,300
We have to fight and we
need to do it together.

House Mormont has kept faith with
House Stark for 1,000 years.

378
00:27:19,019 --> 00:27:21,386
We will not break faith today.

379
00:27:26,126 --> 00:27:28,260
Thank you, my lady.

380
00:27:28,362 --> 00:27:31,563
How many fighting men can we expect?

- 62?
- <i>We are not a large house,</i>

<i>but we're a proud one.</i>

385
00:27:47,281 --> 00:27:49,014
And every man from Bear Island

386
00:27:49,116 --> 00:27:51,483
fights with the strength
of 10 mainlanders.

387
00:27:51,585 --> 00:27:55,153
If they're half
as ferocious as their lady,

388
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:57,489
the Boltons are doomed.

393

I assume you're here

394
00:29:20,107 --> 00:29:22,507
to fulfill the vow you gave my niece.

395
00:29:22,609 --> 00:29:25,911
I don't see Sansa and Arya.

396
00:29:26,013 --> 00:29:28,780
- I don't have them.
- Pity.

397
00:29:28,882 --> 00:29:31,717
Do you wish to resume your captivity?

398
00:29:33,087 --> 00:29:34,353
Then why are you here?

399
00:29:34,455 --> 00:29:36,188
You know why I'm here.

400
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:38,123
This castle belongs to House Frey.

401
00:29:38,225 --> 00:29:39,758
You're trespassing.

402
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:42,627
In the name of King Tommen,
I order you to surrender or--

403
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:46,198
Or you'll kill Edmure?

404
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:49,034
My nephew's marked
for death no matter what.

405
00:29:49,136 --> 00:29:50,569
Hang him and be done with it.

406
00:29:50,671 --> 00:29:52,337
It won't stop with Edmure.

407
00:29:52,439 --> 00:29:54,473
You'll force me to storm the castle.

408
00:29:54,575 --> 00:29:56,375
Hundreds will die.

409
00:29:56,477 --> 00:29:59,878
Hundreds of mine.
Thousands of yours.

410
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,547
If you can breach the walls.

411
00:30:02,649 --> 00:30:06,651
We'll breach them and kill
every last one of you.

412
00:30:08,088 --> 00:30:10,322
But if you surrender,

413
00:30:10,424 --> 00:30:12,657
I'll spare the lives of your men.

414
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,426
On my honor.

415
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:16,128
Your honor?

416
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:19,464
Bargaining with oathbreakers
is like building on quicksand.

417
00:30:19,566 --> 00:30:21,366
The war is over, ser.

418
00:30:21,468 --> 00:30:24,136
Why sacrifice living men
to a lost cause?

419
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:33,945
As long as I'm standing,
the war is not over.

420
00:30:35,115 --> 00:30:36,982
This is my home.

421
00:30:37,084 --> 00:30:40,952
I was born in this castle
and I'm ready to die in it.

422
00:30:41,054 --> 00:30:43,922
So you can either attack

423
00:30:44,024 --> 00:30:46,725
or try to starve us out.

424
00:30:46,827 --> 00:30:49,594
We have enough provisions
for two years.

425
00:30:51,331 --> 00:30:55,133
Do you have two years, Kingslayer?

426
00:31:00,107 --> 00:31:03,341
You clearly have no intention
of saving your men's lives.

427
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:05,177
Why did you come treat with me?

428
00:31:06,547 --> 00:31:08,580
Sieges are dull.

429
00:31:08,682 --> 00:31:12,150

person, get the measure of you.

Well, now you have.

431
00:31:14,888 --> 00:31:16,922
Aye, now I have.

432
00:31:17,024 --> 00:31:19,491
I'm disappointed.

- I've heard enough.

435
00:31:34,174 --> 00:31:36,875
We've only just taken back
this castle from the ironborn.

436
00:31:36,977 --> 00:31:38,977
The Boltons helped us do it.

437
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:40,912
Now you want me
to fight against them?

438
00:31:41,014 --> 00:31:42,981
I could be skinned
for even talking to you.

439
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:45,350
The Boltons are traitors.
Roose Bolton--

440
00:31:45,452 --> 00:31:48,520
Have other northern houses
pledged to fight for you?

441
00:31:48,622 --> 00:31:51,490
House Mormont.

442
00:31:51,592 --> 00:31:53,525
And?

443
00:31:53,627 --> 00:31:56,027
We sent ravens
to Houses Manderly--

444
00:31:56,129 --> 00:31:58,964
I don't care about ravens.

445
00:31:59,066 --> 00:32:01,333
You're asking me to join your army.

446
00:32:01,435 --> 00:32:04,769
Who is fighting in this army?

447
00:32:10,043 --> 00:32:12,644
The bulk of the force
is made up of wildlings.

I didn't dare believe them.

respect for your father.

452
00:32:28,328 --> 00:32:30,262
Now I would like you to leave.

453
00:32:30,364 --> 00:32:33,665

abandon its ancestral home

454
00:32:33,767 --> 00:32:36,401
to fight alongside wildlings.

455
00:32:38,171 --> 00:32:40,171
- Lord Glover.
- There's nothing else to say.

456
00:32:40,274 --> 00:32:42,340
I would remind you that House Glover

457
00:32:42,442 --> 00:32:44,442
is pledged to House Stark.

458
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:47,445
Sworn to answer when called upon.

459
00:32:57,491 --> 00:33:01,626
Yes, my family served
House Stark for centuries.

460
00:33:01,728 --> 00:33:04,529
We wept when we heard
of your father's death.

461
00:33:04,631 --> 00:33:09,100
When my brother was lord of this
castle, he answered Robb's call

462

and hailed him King in the North.

463
00:33:16,376 --> 00:33:18,610
And where was King Robb

464
00:33:18,712 --> 00:33:21,880
when the ironborn
attacked this castle?

465
00:33:21,982 --> 00:33:25,617
When they threw my wife
and children in prison

466
00:33:25,719 --> 00:33:29,454
and brutalized
and killed our subjects?

467
00:33:29,556 --> 00:33:33,391
Taking up with a foreign whore.
