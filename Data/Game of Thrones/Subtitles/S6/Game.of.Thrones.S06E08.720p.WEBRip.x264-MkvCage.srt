Now listen to me, Pod.

223

are about a yard apart?

224
00:15:35,788 --> 00:15:38,475
Lesson number one, assume
everyone wants to hit you.

225

wants to hit a fucking squire.

Of course, my sister

00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:09,642
The girl is still a suspect
in Joffrey's murder,

237
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:13,322
so there is that complication.

238
00:16:15,021 --> 00:16:16,287
What the hell are you doing here?

239
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:17,995

Lady Sansa desires to take her
ancestral seat back from the Boltons

242
00:16:23,628 --> 00:16:26,666
and assume her rightful
position as Lady of Winterfell.

243
00:16:26,764 --> 00:16:29,706
With what army does she
plan on taking Winterfell?

244
00:16:29,804 --> 00:16:31,114
The Tully army.

245
00:16:31,212 --> 00:16:32,874
They're a bit occupied at the moment.

246
00:16:32,972 --> 00:16:34,571
I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun

247
00:16:34,669 --> 00:16:36,331
currently defended
by the Tully rebels,

248
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:38,059
so you can see the conundrum.

249
00:16:38,157 --> 00:16:40,171
The Tullys are rebels because
they're fighting for their home?

250
00:16:40,268 --> 00:16:42,603
Riverrun was granted to
the Freys by royal decree.

251
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:46,058
As a reward for betraying Robb
Stark and slaughtering his family.

252
00:16:46,157 --> 00:16:47,499
Exactly.

253
00:16:51,309 --> 00:16:52,907
We shouldn't argue about politics.

254
00:16:53,004 --> 00:16:55,626
You're a knight, Ser Jaime.

00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:57,611
I know there is honor in you.

256
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:00,362
- I've seen it myself.
- I'm a Lannister.

257
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,282
Don't ask me to betray my own house.

258
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,554
I do no such thing.

259
00:17:04,652 --> 00:17:07,115
Take Riverrun without bloodshed.

260
00:17:07,213 --> 00:17:10,603
Ride south again with your mission
complete and your army intact.

What do you propose?

262
00:17:12,332 --> 00:17:15,851
Allow me to enter Riverrun
under a flag of truce.

263
00:17:15,948 --> 00:17:18,268
Let me try to persuade the
Blackfish to give up the castle.

264
00:17:18,285 --> 00:17:20,203
Why would he abandon
his ancestral home?

265
00:17:20,301 --> 00:17:23,754
Because you'll allow him to lead
the Tully forces safely north.

266
00:17:26,636 --> 00:17:28,427
Have you ever met the Blackfish?

267
00:17:30,413 --> 00:17:33,131
- No.
- He's even more stubborn than you are.

268
00:17:33,228 --> 00:17:35,211
All right.

269

Try to talk some sense
into the old goat.

270

He won't listen, but his men might.

271
00:17:40,013 --> 00:17:42,379
Not everybody wants to die
for someone else's home.

272
00:17:42,476 --> 00:17:44,426
I need your word.

273
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,531
If I persuade him
to abandon the castle,

274
00:17:47,628 --> 00:17:49,963
you'll grant a safe passage north.

275
00:17:50,061 --> 00:17:52,170

276
00:17:52,268 --> 00:17:54,122

Three lords

407

The Lannister, outraged, shoves the
cup aside and demands another.

412

The Martell plucks the fly
out and swallows it whole.

413
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:55,786
The Stark reaches into his cup,

414
00:26:55,884 --> 00:26:58,570
pulls out the fly and shouts,

415
00:26:58,668 --> 00:27:01,130
"Spit it out, you wee shit.

Oh.
Oh, I see.

You're a madman.

I'm not here to trade insults.

I suppose all mothers do,

you don't often see.

523

I have to take Riverrun.

You're a fighter.

684

You were born a fighter.

685
00:46:30,027 --> 00:46:32,329
You walked away from the fight.

How did that go?

Good and bad, young and old,

688

will destroy them all alike.
