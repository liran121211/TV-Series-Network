I've killed wildlings.
I've killed men that I admire.

I hanged a boy
younger than Bran.

00:13:39,349 --> 00:13:41,683
Here's to reversals
of fortune.

171
00:13:41,768 --> 00:13:43,351
We came here
to meet the queen

172
00:13:43,437 --> 00:13:45,854
and instead we're greeted
by a dwarf and a eunuch.

173
00:13:45,939 --> 00:13:49,757
Let's make this simple, shall we?
Tell me what you want.

174
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,777
We want you to leave
Slaver's Bay.

175
00:13:52,896 --> 00:13:56,597
Take your dragons and
your mercenaries and go.

176
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,267
Queen Daenerys won't stay
in Meereen forever.

177
00:13:59,369 --> 00:14:01,119
Her path takes
her westward.

178
00:14:01,238 --> 00:14:03,571
When we last met,
I offered her ships

179
00:14:03,657 --> 00:14:07,542
so she could return to Westeros where
she belongs. She refused them.

180
00:14:07,627 --> 00:14:09,747
She refused them because
hundreds of thousands

181
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,796
of men, women, and children
still lived in chains.

182
00:14:11,915 --> 00:14:14,332
As they have
since the dawn of time.

183
00:14:14,418 --> 00:14:17,602
- Not anymore.
- You think you're a free man now?

184
00:14:17,721 --> 00:14:19,554
You still follow orders.

185
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:22,199
Just because your master
has silver hair and tits

186
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:24,009
doesn't mean
she's not a master.

187
00:14:24,094 --> 00:14:27,562
Friends, friends,
friends, please.

188
00:14:27,647 --> 00:14:32,183
There have always been those with wealth
and power and those with nothing.

189
00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:35,303
That is the way of the world. I'm not
here to change the way of the world.

190
00:14:35,405 --> 00:14:37,856
Slavery is the way
of our world.

191
00:14:37,941 --> 00:14:41,443
You don't need slaves
to make money.

192
00:14:41,528 --> 00:14:44,412
There haven't been slaves in
Westeros for hundreds of years

193
00:14:44,498 --> 00:14:46,658
and I grew up richer
than any of you.

194
00:14:48,452 --> 00:14:52,153
But our queen recognizes
that she erred

195
00:14:52,255 --> 00:14:54,873
by abolishing slavery

196
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:57,825
without providing
a new system to replace it.

197
00:14:57,928 --> 00:15:01,679
So here
is the queen's proposal.

198
00:15:01,798 --> 00:15:04,665
Slavery will never
return to Meereen,

199
00:15:04,768 --> 00:15:07,502
but she will give the other
cities of Slaver's Bay

200
00:15:07,604 --> 00:15:09,554
time to adjust
to the new order.

201
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:10,972
What does that mean?

202
00:15:11,058 --> 00:15:14,192
Instead of abolishing
slavery overnight,

203
00:15:14,311 --> 00:15:17,391
we will give you seven
years to end the practice.

204
00:15:22,152 --> 00:15:23,985
Slaveholders
will be compensated

205
00:15:24,071 --> 00:15:26,821
for their losses,
of course, at fair prices.

206
00:15:26,907 --> 00:15:29,407
In exchange,
you will cut off

207
00:15:29,493 --> 00:15:31,242
your support for
the Sons of the Harpy.

208
00:15:31,328 --> 00:15:32,888
We do not support
the Sons of the Harpy.

209
00:15:32,996 --> 00:15:36,047
Fine, fine, but you will
cut it off all the same.

210
00:15:37,217 --> 00:15:40,201
I do hope you accept,
my friends.

So why do you represent Meereen
in these talks with our enemies?

234
00:17:11,928 --> 00:17:15,346
Because our queen
chose me as her advisor.

Until she returns
from her travels...

236
00:17:17,651 --> 00:17:19,150

a graveyard.

It was a feast.

386
00:30:33,729 --> 00:30:36,030
I bought old fine wine

laid bare.

396

and the perfume

398

already started to turn.

399

with perfect clarity.

I've been thinking
about the High Sparrow.

He has Margaery.
We can't put her at risk.

- He's dangerous.
- Look at me.

467
00:36:02,891 --> 00:36:04,758
What did they do to me?

468
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,777
To the king's own mother?

469

You don't
like Margaery, do you?

Whether I like her or not
is completely unimportant.

Margaery is the queen.

Queens must command respect.
Kings even more so.

00:36:40,596 --> 00:36:43,430
Not just for their own sake,
but for everyone's.

478
00:36:45,401 --> 00:36:48,819
The High Sparrow has no
respect for kings or queens.

You've spoken with him?

I promised him I wouldn't tell anyone.
If he found out I told...

490
00:37:23,722 --> 00:37:26,523
It would be a breach of confidence
which he would not take lightly

She has the king's ear
and his trust.

504
00:38:13,739 --> 00:38:15,689
And the king has been
speaking regularly

505
00:38:15,774 --> 00:38:19,192
with the High Sparrow about
Queen Margaery and Ser Loras.

506
00:38:19,278 --> 00:38:20,911
The High Sparrow
seized power

507
00:38:21,029 --> 00:38:22,996
knowing full well we'd
bicker amongst ourselves

508
00:38:23,081 --> 00:38:24,781
instead of
seizing it back.

509
00:38:24,867 --> 00:38:26,700
Here we are.
Well done to us.

510
00:38:26,785 --> 00:38:28,902
Now the future
of the Seven Kingdoms

511
00:38:28,987 --> 00:38:30,837
rests in his dirty
peasant hands.

512
00:38:30,923 --> 00:38:33,707
In a few days, he'll have
a trial for me.

513
00:38:33,792 --> 00:38:37,377
But before that, Queen Margaery
will make her walk of atonement.

514
00:38:37,463 --> 00:38:41,080
Yes, Margaery
will repent her sins

515
00:38:41,183 --> 00:38:43,133
before the good people
of the city.

516
00:38:43,218 --> 00:38:45,719
Oh, no.

517
00:38:45,804 --> 00:38:48,605
That cannot happen.

518
00:38:48,724 --> 00:38:50,524
That will not happen.

519
00:38:50,609 --> 00:38:52,275
I agree.

520
00:38:54,897 --> 00:38:57,814
You've got the second
largest army in Westeros.

521
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,366
You'll bring them
into the city,

522
00:38:59,451 --> 00:39:02,118
stop Queen Margaery's
humiliation before it starts,

523
00:39:02,237 --> 00:39:04,621
and take her back
into Crown custody.

524
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:08,458
The king has ordered me to take no
action against the High Sparrow

525
00:39:08,577 --> 00:39:11,661
or the Faith Militant out of
fear for the queen's safety.

526
00:39:11,747 --> 00:39:13,613
You will take
no action at all.

527
00:39:13,715 --> 00:39:16,249
When the Tyrell armies come,
you will stand down.

528
00:39:16,335 --> 00:39:20,003
<i>Are you expressly forbidden
from standing down?</i>

529
00:39:20,088 --> 00:39:22,973
No, but if the king
should call...

530
00:39:23,091 --> 00:39:25,842
The whole thing will be over before
anyone can call on you to do anything.

531
00:39:25,928 --> 00:39:30,096
When the High Sparrow is in
custody or dead, preferably,

532
00:39:30,182 --> 00:39:32,732
and Margaery's back
at Tommen's side,

533
00:39:32,818 --> 00:39:34,978
do you think the king
will be angry at the outcome?

534
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,771
You hate these fanatics
as much as we do.

535
00:39:37,856 --> 00:39:41,140
You hate what they've
done to your son.

536
00:39:41,243 --> 00:39:43,109
Do you want Lancel back?

537
00:39:43,195 --> 00:39:45,675
Or have you given
him up for good?

538
00:39:46,865 --> 00:39:49,115
Of course
I want him back.

539
00:39:52,504 --> 00:39:54,120
Then stand aside

540
00:39:54,206 --> 00:39:57,424
and let the people that took
him from you be destroyed.

541
00:40:00,963 --> 00:40:02,796
If it doesn't
go as planned,

542
00:40:02,881 --> 00:40:05,265
the sparrows have
many friends in this city.

543
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:08,101
<i>We'll have civil war.
Many will die.</i>

544
00:40:08,186 --> 00:40:10,604
Many will die
no matter what we do.

545
00:40:12,357 --> 00:40:14,107

They told me you were home

549
00:41:15,003 --> 00:41:17,737
"Theon Greyjoy?"
I said.

550
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:20,173
"He's dead.

551
00:41:20,258 --> 00:41:22,658
He's been dead
a long time."

552
00:41:25,764 --> 00:41:27,747
He let you go?

553
00:41:27,849 --> 00:41:29,299
I escaped.

554
00:41:31,853 --> 00:41:33,687
I can't hear you.

555
00:41:33,772 --> 00:41:35,438
I escaped.

556
00:41:37,776 --> 00:41:39,559
Look at me.

557
00:41:48,236 --> 00:41:49,619
Look at me.

558
00:41:51,073 --> 00:41:53,740
Men died trying
to rescue you.

559
00:41:53,825 --> 00:41:55,441
Good men.

560
00:41:55,544 --> 00:41:56,993
My men.

561
00:41:58,463 --> 00:42:00,113
I'm sorry.

562
00:42:00,215 --> 00:42:02,248
You were my brother.

563
00:42:02,334 --> 00:42:05,385
You were a spoiled little cunt,
but you were my brother

564
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:07,453
and I risked
everything for you

565
00:42:07,556 --> 00:42:08,922
and you betrayed me.

566
00:42:09,007 --> 00:42:11,174
I know.
I know and I'm sorry.

567
00:42:11,259 --> 00:42:12,592
Stop saying that.

568
00:42:13,645 --> 00:42:14,894
He broke me.

569
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:17,681
He broke me
into 1,000 pieces.

570
00:42:17,766 --> 00:42:19,149
- I know.
- You don't know.

571
00:42:19,267 --> 00:42:21,768
He sent us
one of those pieces.

572
00:42:21,853 --> 00:42:23,820

Where else could I go?

You heard Father was dead and you
thought you'd claim the crown?

No, no. I only heard he
died after we docked.

You happen to show up on Pyke
right before the kingsmoot?

I didn't know.

580
00:42:46,928 --> 00:42:50,130
You think any ironborn
wants you to be king

581
00:42:50,215 --> 00:42:52,015
after what you've done?

582
00:42:52,134 --> 00:42:54,100
I don't want
to be king.

What do you want?

584
00:42:57,522 --> 00:42:59,602
I should have listened to you.

Stop crying.

They put me in chains

604
00:44:44,963 --> 00:44:46,830
and put a sword
at my throat,

605
00:44:46,915 --> 00:44:48,214
so I served them.

606
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:51,668
The Starks have been
gone for a long time,

607
00:44:51,753 --> 00:44:54,554
but you kept
protecting Rickon.

608
00:44:54,639 --> 00:44:58,141
He'd fetch a good price
to the right buyer.

609

a long time.

610
