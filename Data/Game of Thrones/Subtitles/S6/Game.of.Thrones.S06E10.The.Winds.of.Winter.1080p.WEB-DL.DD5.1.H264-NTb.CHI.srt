00:36:47,416 --> 00:36:49,383
I'm not a Stark.

344
00:36:49,485 --> 00:36:51,886
You are to me.

345
00:36:55,558 --> 00:36:57,224
You're the Lady of Winterfell.

346
00:36:57,326 --> 00:37:01,228
You deserve it. We're
standing here because of you.

347
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:04,832
<i>The battle was lost until the
Knights of the Vale rode in.</i>

348
00:37:04,934 --> 00:37:07,134
They came because of you.

349
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:14,074
You told me Lord Baelish
sold you to the Boltons.

350
00:37:14,176 --> 00:37:15,943
- He did.
- And you trust him?

351
00:37:16,045 --> 00:37:19,680
<font color="#808080">(CHUCKLES)</font> Only a fool
would trust Littlefinger.

352
00:37:22,818 --> 00:37:25,586
I should have told you about him,

353
00:37:25,688 --> 00:37:29,023
about the Knights of the Vale.

354
00:37:29,125 --> 00:37:30,591
I'm sorry.

355
00:37:41,904 --> 00:37:43,871
We need to trust each other.

356
00:37:43,973 --> 00:37:46,974
We can't fight a war
amongst ourselves.

357
00:37:47,076 --> 00:37:49,577
We have so many enemies now.

358
00:38:05,828 --> 00:38:07,861
Jon.

359
00:38:07,964 --> 00:38:11,398
A raven came from the Citadel.

360
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,400
A white raven.

361
00:38:16,105 --> 00:38:17,638
Winter is here.

362
00:38:29,919 --> 00:38:33,053
Well, Father always
promised, didn't he?

363
00:38:47,136 --> 00:38:50,304
The last time a Tyrell came to Dorne,

364
00:38:50,406 --> 00:38:52,506
he was assassinated.

365
00:38:52,608 --> 00:38:55,175
100 red scorpions, was it?

366
00:38:55,277 --> 00:38:57,778
You have nothing to fear
from us, Lady Olenna.

367
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,014
You murder your own prince,

368
00:39:00,116 --> 00:39:01,849
but you expect me to trust you?

369
00:39:01,951 --> 00:39:04,918
We invited you to Dorne
because we needed your help.

370
00:39:05,021 --> 00:39:07,287
You came to Dorne because
you needed our help.

371
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:09,890
What is your name again?

372
00:39:09,992 --> 00:39:11,358
Barbaro?

373
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,060
- <font color="#808080">(CHUCKLES)</font>
- Obara.

374
00:39:13,162 --> 00:39:16,296
Obara. You look like
an angry little boy.

375
00:39:16,399 --> 00:39:19,033
<i>Don't presume to tell me what I need.</i>

376
00:39:19,135 --> 00:39:22,469
Forgive my sister. What she
lacks in diplomacy, she makes...

377
00:39:22,571 --> 00:39:26,073
Do shut up, dear. Anything from you?

378
00:39:26,175 --> 00:39:28,075
No? Good.

379
00:39:28,177 --> 00:39:30,577
Let the grown women speak.

380
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:34,381
The Lannisters have declared
war on House Tyrell.

381
00:39:34,483 --> 00:39:37,451
They have declared war on Dorne.

382
00:39:37,553 --> 00:39:41,188
We must be allies now
if we wish to survive.

383
00:39:42,491 --> 00:39:45,459
Cersei stole the future from me.

384
00:39:45,561 --> 00:39:47,327
She killed my son.

385
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:49,463
<i>She killed my grandson.</i>

386
00:39:49,565 --> 00:39:52,766
She killed my granddaughter.

387
00:39:52,868 --> 00:39:55,703
Survival is not what I'm after now.

388
00:39:55,805 --> 00:39:57,971
You're absolutely right.

389
00:39:58,074 --> 00:40:00,641
I chose the wrong words.

390
00:40:00,743 --> 00:40:03,243
It is not survival I offer.

391
00:40:03,345 --> 00:40:05,679
It is your heart's desire.

392
00:40:05,781 --> 00:40:07,414
<font color="#808080">(RINGS)</font>

393
00:40:07,516 --> 00:40:10,718
And what is my heart's desire?

394
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:14,521
Vengeance.

395
00:40:14,623 --> 00:40:15,723
Justice.

396
00:40:15,825 --> 00:40:17,758
<i><font color="#808080">(FOOTSTEPS)</font></i>

397
00:40:19,462 --> 00:40:21,328
Fire and blood.

398
00:40:27,803 --> 00:40:30,604
Your ships are nearly ready.

399
00:40:30,706 --> 00:40:33,006
I saw 'em painting the sails.

400
00:40:36,445 --> 00:40:40,247
I'm curious to see how the
Dothraki do on the poison water.

401
00:40:40,349 --> 00:40:42,249
You're not coming with us.

402
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:47,855
New strategy?

403
00:40:47,957 --> 00:40:51,158
You want the Second Sons to
attack from the west coast?

404
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:53,861
If we take Casterly Rock,

405
00:40:53,963 --> 00:40:57,531
the Lannisters will have nowhere to
run when you hit King's Landing.

406
00:40:57,633 --> 00:40:59,566
You're not going to Westeros.

407
00:40:59,668 --> 00:41:02,603
You're staying here
with the Second Sons.

408
00:41:02,705 --> 00:41:05,339
There's finally peace in Meereen.

409
00:41:05,441 --> 00:41:08,776
You will keep the peace while the
people choose their own leaders.

410
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,879
Fuck Meereen.

411
00:41:11,981 --> 00:41:13,881
Fuck the people.

412
00:41:13,983 --> 00:41:16,250
I'm here for you, not 'em.

413
00:41:16,352 --> 00:41:18,018
You promised me.

414
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:21,054
"My sword is yours.
My life is yours."

415
00:41:21,157 --> 00:41:24,258
<i>This is what I command.</i>

416
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,361
If I'm going to rule in Westeros,

417
00:41:27,463 --> 00:41:29,963
I'll need to make alliances.

418
00:41:30,065 --> 00:41:33,433
The best way to make
alliances is with marriage.

419
00:41:36,772 --> 00:41:38,605
Who are you marrying this time?

420
00:41:38,707 --> 00:41:42,075
I don't know. Maybe no one.

421
00:41:42,178 --> 00:41:45,279
But you need to lure all the
noble houses to the table?

422
00:41:45,381 --> 00:41:47,347
Are you a queen or fish bait?

423
00:41:49,785 --> 00:41:52,753
I can't bring a lover to Westeros.

424
00:41:52,855 --> 00:41:55,088
A king wouldn't think twice about it.

425
00:41:55,191 --> 00:41:58,091
So that's what you want?
To be my mistress?

426
00:41:58,194 --> 00:42:01,495
I'm not proud. I don't care
what perfumed aristocrat

427
00:42:01,597 --> 00:42:03,697
sits beside you in the throne room.

428
00:42:03,799 --> 00:42:06,834
I don't want a crown. I want you.

429
00:42:13,809 --> 00:42:16,009
I love you.

430
00:42:16,111 --> 00:42:18,579
And I make you happy.

431
00:42:18,681 --> 00:42:20,547
You know I do.

432
00:42:22,785 --> 00:42:26,486
Bring me with you.
Let me fight for you.

433
00:42:34,096 --> 00:42:35,362
I can't.

434
00:42:45,107 --> 00:42:46,840
The dwarf told you to do this?

435
00:42:46,942 --> 00:42:48,609
<i>No one tells me to do anything.</i>

436
00:42:48,711 --> 00:42:51,879
Clever fellow.
Can't argue with his logic.

437
00:42:51,981 --> 00:42:53,714
I'm no use to you over there.

438
00:42:53,816 --> 00:42:55,082
Don't get angry.

439
00:42:55,184 --> 00:42:58,352
I'm not angry. I'm full of self-pity.

440
00:42:58,454 --> 00:43:00,053
Who comes after you?

441
00:43:00,155 --> 00:43:03,323
Who can ever follow Daenerys
Stormborn, the Mother of Dragons?

442
00:43:03,425 --> 00:43:05,692
A great number of women, I imagine.

443
00:43:11,901 --> 00:43:13,734
Specific orders will be left for you

444
00:43:13,836 --> 00:43:16,770
regarding the welfare of Meereen
and the Bay of Dragons.

445
00:43:16,872 --> 00:43:18,672
Bay of Dragons?

446
00:43:18,774 --> 00:43:21,775
We can't call it Slaver's
Bay anymore, can we?

447
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:28,081
You'll get that throne you
want so badly, I'm sure of it.

448
00:43:29,418 --> 00:43:31,618
I hope it brings you happiness.

449
00:43:36,692 --> 00:43:39,293
I pity the lords of Westeros.

450
00:43:39,395 --> 00:43:41,561
They have no idea
what's coming for 'em.

451
00:43:41,664 --> 00:43:45,599
Farewell, Daario Naharis.

452
00:43:59,982 --> 00:44:02,215
<i><font color="#808080">(FOOTSTEPS)</font></i>

453
00:44:04,286 --> 00:44:06,586
How did he take it?

454
00:44:06,689 --> 00:44:08,755
No tears.

455
00:44:10,826 --> 00:44:13,460
I know it was hard for you.

456
00:44:13,562 --> 00:44:15,595
You turned away a man
who truly loves you

457
00:44:15,698 --> 00:44:18,598
because he would have been a
liability in the Seven Kingdoms.

458
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:24,871
That's the kind of self-sacrifice
that makes for a good ruler,

459
00:44:24,974 --> 00:44:27,140
if it's any consolation.

460
00:44:30,045 --> 00:44:31,845
It's not.

461
00:44:31,947 --> 00:44:34,247
No, I suppose not.

462
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:35,882
I'm terrible at consoling.

463
00:44:35,985 --> 00:44:38,285
Yes, you really are.

464
00:44:41,457 --> 00:44:45,659
All right, how about the fact
that this is actually happening?

465
00:44:47,162 --> 00:44:50,030
You have your armies,
you have your ships,

466
00:44:50,132 --> 00:44:52,132
you have your dragons.

467
00:44:52,234 --> 00:44:54,201
Everything you've ever wanted

468
00:44:54,303 --> 00:44:57,204
since you were old enough
to want anything,

469
00:44:57,306 --> 00:44:59,172
it's all yours for the taking.

470
00:45:00,943 --> 00:45:02,876
Are you afraid?

471
00:45:06,048 --> 00:45:07,914
Good.

472
00:45:08,017 --> 00:45:10,751
You're in the great game now.

473
00:45:10,853 --> 00:45:13,420
And the great game's terrifying.

474
00:45:13,522 --> 00:45:15,989
The only people who
aren't afraid of failure

475
00:45:16,091 --> 00:45:18,191
are madmen like your father.

476
00:45:20,295 --> 00:45:22,396
Do you know what frightens me?

477
00:45:23,866 --> 00:45:26,533
I said farewell
to a man who loves me.

478
00:45:28,404 --> 00:45:31,972
A man I thought I cared for.

479
00:45:32,074 --> 00:45:34,041
And I felt nothing.

480
00:45:35,644 --> 00:45:37,544
Just impatient to get on with it.

481
00:45:40,649 --> 00:45:43,717
He wasn't the first to love you

482
00:45:43,819 --> 00:45:45,886
and he won't be the last.

483
00:45:49,792 --> 00:45:54,694
Well, you have completely
failed to console me.

484
00:45:57,266 --> 00:45:59,733
For what it's worth,
I've been a cynic

485
00:45:59,835 --> 00:46:01,968
for as long as I can remember.

486
00:46:02,071 --> 00:46:04,871
Everyone's always asking me
to believe in things...

487
00:46:04,973 --> 00:46:08,708
Family, gods, kings, myself.

488
00:46:08,811 --> 00:46:10,644
It was often tempting

489
00:46:10,746 --> 00:46:13,080
until I saw where belief got people.

490
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:17,050
So I said no, thank you to belief.

491
00:46:17,152 --> 00:46:20,454
And yet here I am.

492
00:46:23,158 --> 00:46:25,425
I believe in you.

493
00:46:27,362 --> 00:46:29,763
It's embarrassing, really.

494
00:46:31,834 --> 00:46:33,633
I'd swear you my sword,

495
00:46:33,735 --> 00:46:36,770
but I don't actually own a sword.

496
00:46:36,872 --> 00:46:38,872
It's your counsel I need.

497
00:46:38,974 --> 00:46:41,408
It's yours.

498
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:42,943
Now and always.

499
00:46:44,446 --> 00:46:46,279
Good.

500
00:46:47,583 --> 00:46:49,616
I, um...

501
00:46:49,718 --> 00:46:51,485
I had something made for you.

502
00:46:53,188 --> 00:46:55,722
I'm not sure if it's right.

503
00:47:05,033 --> 00:47:07,734
Tyrion Lannister,

504
00:47:07,836 --> 00:47:09,736
I name you Hand of the Queen.

505
00:47:43,972 --> 00:47:46,506
You're not one of mine, are you?

506
00:47:46,608 --> 00:47:48,108
No, my lord.

507
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:49,876
Didn't think so.

508
00:47:49,978 --> 00:47:52,212
Too pretty.

509
00:47:56,485 --> 00:47:59,286
Where are my damn moron sons?

510
00:47:59,388 --> 00:48:03,123
Black Walder and Lothar
promised to be here by midday.

511
00:48:03,225 --> 00:48:05,058
They're here, my lord.

512
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:08,461
Well, what are they doing,
trimming their cunt hairs?

513
00:48:08,564 --> 00:48:10,630
Tell 'em to come here now.

514
00:48:10,732 --> 00:48:12,999
But they're already here, my lord.

515
00:48:17,039 --> 00:48:20,040
Here, my lord.

516
00:48:38,327 --> 00:48:40,360
They weren't easy to carve.

517
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:43,930
Especially Black Walder.

518
00:48:44,032 --> 00:48:46,600

519
00:48:54,009 --> 00:48:55,675
My name is Arya Stark.

520
00:48:55,777 --> 00:48:57,277
I want you to know that.

521
00:48:57,379 --> 00:49:00,113

I came here every day

529

I prayed to be somewhere else.

530
00:50:15,657 --> 00:50:17,757
Back then I only thought
about what I wanted,

531
00:50:17,859 --> 00:50:19,693
never about what I had.

532
00:50:23,465 --> 00:50:24,898

I close my eyes and see
the same picture.

540
00:50:48,354 --> 00:50:51,756
Whenever I consider
an action, I ask myself

541
00:50:51,858 --> 00:50:55,993
will this action help to make
this picture a reality?

542
00:50:57,964 --> 00:51:00,732
Pull it out of my mind

543

544
00:51:04,771 --> 00:51:07,739

quickly through the Seven Kingdoms.

of Ned and Catelyn Stark

born here at Winterfell

560

The Wall is not just ice and stone.

Ancient spells were carved
into its foundations.
