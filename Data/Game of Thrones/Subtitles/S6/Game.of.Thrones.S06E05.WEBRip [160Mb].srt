1
00:01:32,421 --> 00:01:33,764
Yes?

2
00:01:36,456 --> 00:01:37,798
For you, milady.

3
00:01:57,287 --> 00:01:58,805
The Village Mole far?

4
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:08,219
Sansa.

5
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,532
Lady Brienne.

6
00:02:16,867 --> 00:02:19,664
When I heard that escaped
Winterfell, I feared the worst.

7
00:02:21,303 --> 00:02:24,658
You have no idea how
I am happy to see her unharmed.

8
00:02:26,098 --> 00:02:27,440
Ilesa?

9
00:02:28,894 --> 00:02:30,237
What are you doing here?

10
00:02:30,411 --> 00:02:33,010
I came with the Knights
Valley to help her.

11
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:36,088
<i>Are camped in Moat Cailin at this time.</i>

12
00:02:36,127 --> 00:02:37,470
To help me?

13
00:02:39,044 --> 00:02:40,723
You knew about Ramsay?

14
00:02:42,401 --> 00:02:45,598
If you did not know, he is an idiot.
If you know, he is my enemy.

15
00:02:46,716 --> 00:02:49,593
I wonder
our wedding night?

16
00:02:51,511 --> 00:02:53,428
<i>He never hurt my face.</i>

17
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,265
He needed my face,
Ned Stark's daughter's face.

18
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:02,925
But the rest...

19
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:06,737
He did what he wanted with the rest...

20
00:03:06,855 --> 00:03:09,294
<i>As long as he could give him an heir.</i>

21
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:13,634
What do you think he did?

22
00:03:18,045 --> 00:03:19,322
I can not imagine...

23
00:03:19,323 --> 00:03:20,922
What do you think you did to me?

24
00:03:29,714 --> 00:03:31,752
Lady Sansa did you
a question.

25
00:03:33,231 --> 00:03:34,229
He hit you.

26
00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:36,946
Yes, he liked that.
What else you think you did?

27
00:03:37,067 --> 00:03:38,503
- Sansa, I...
- What else?

28
00:03:41,941 --> 00:03:43,284
He cut?

29
00:03:45,217 --> 00:03:46,897
Perhaps he knew about Ramsay.

30
00:03:46,936 --> 00:03:47,856
Do not know.

31
00:03:47,935 --> 00:03:49,828
I thought I knew
secrets of all.

32
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,173
I made a mistake...

33
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,489
A horrible mistake.
I underestimated a stranger.

34
00:03:56,368 --> 00:03:59,445
Women should not talk
about the other things he did...

35
00:03:59,483 --> 00:04:02,360
But I imagine that owners
brothels speak of them all the time.

36
00:04:04,279 --> 00:04:05,719
I can still feel.

37
00:04:07,156 --> 00:04:09,994
Not in my heart,
still hurts me a lot.

38
00:04:10,033 --> 00:04:12,951
I still feel what he did
my body right here, right now.

39
00:04:15,787 --> 00:04:17,627
I feel...

40
00:04:18,266 --> 00:04:19,185
A lot.

41
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:21,622
- You said you would protect me.
-. <i> And protect</i>

42
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,335
- You must believe me.
- I do not believe you anymore.

43
00:04:26,336 --> 00:04:29,213
I do not need you anymore.
You can not protect me.

44
00:04:29,815 --> 00:04:33,051
Do not get or protect yourself
to ask Brienne to kill him.

45
00:04:35,928 --> 00:04:37,845
Why should not kill him?

46
00:04:40,684 --> 00:04:42,562
Want to beg for my life
?

47
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:44,558
If this is what you want, I beg.

48
00:04:47,077 --> 00:04:50,312
I'll do anything you ask
and in my power...

49
00:04:51,873 --> 00:04:53,830
And if you want to die
here and now?

50
00:04:56,067 --> 00:04:57,409
So, I will die.

51
00:04:59,584 --> 00:05:02,780
You saved me from the monsters
who killed my family...

52
00:05:03,461 --> 00:05:06,498
And gave me the other monsters
who killed my family.

53
00:05:08,534 --> 00:05:09,894
<i>Return to Moat Cailin.</i>

54
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:14,409
My brother and I will resume
north. I never want to see it.

55
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:17,726
I would do anything to undo
what they did to you.

56
00:05:20,044 --> 00:05:21,386
I know I can not.

57
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:26,756
Do you allow me to say
one more thing before you go?

58
00:05:29,633 --> 00:05:32,352
<i>His uncle,
Brynden the Blackfish...</i>

59
00:05:32,951 --> 00:05:36,269
He joined the remnants of the forces
Tully and resumed Riverrun.

60
00:05:36,346 --> 00:05:37,787
Should look for him.

61
00:05:38,986 --> 00:05:41,702
You may need
a loyal army to you.

62
00:05:41,743 --> 00:05:43,085
I have an army.

63
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,740
The army of his brother.

64
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,073
Half brother.

65
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:23,803
Not ready.

66
00:06:26,216 --> 00:06:28,695
Should go home before
it is too late.

67
00:07:22,921 --> 00:07:24,480
It will never be one of us...

68
00:07:24,718 --> 00:07:26,060
<i>Lady Stark.</i>

69
00:07:40,863 --> 00:07:42,206
She's right.

70
00:07:48,016 --> 00:07:51,493
None of the Faceless Men
born lords and ladies.

71
00:07:51,533 --> 00:07:53,890
Began as slaves in the mines of
Valyria.

72
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:56,727
- Who was the first?
- He was nobody.

73
00:07:58,365 --> 00:08:01,483
The God of Many Faces you
taught how to hide his face...

74
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:03,079
And how to give the "gift."

75
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,956
The man taught others
in exchange for their services.

76
00:08:06,357 --> 00:08:09,234
Many served,
more gifts were given.

77
00:08:10,033 --> 00:08:12,750
So all teachers
and foremen went away...

78
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:14,749
And Men
Faceless fled.

79
00:08:14,909 --> 00:08:16,252
Where do you go?

80
00:08:17,586 --> 00:08:18,665
Here.

81
00:08:18,705 --> 00:08:22,142
They founded the Free City of Bravos
and built this house.

82
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,217
These are the faces that used
when they were alive...

83
00:08:26,257 --> 00:08:27,937
When not used other.

84
00:08:28,255 --> 00:08:29,974
The first
Faceless Men.

85
00:08:32,531 --> 00:08:35,688
Now the girl is one of them,
if the girl you want.

86
00:08:37,806 --> 00:08:39,564
The girl has no desire
.

87
00:08:47,556 --> 00:08:48,898
Who?

88
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:58,426
<i>An actress
called Lady Crane.</i>

89
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,623
It acts in the theater of
Sheelba Square.

90
00:09:02,661 --> 00:09:04,739
<i>To the girl was given
a second chance.</i>

91
00:09:06,177 --> 00:09:07,520
There will be a third.

92
00:09:08,335 --> 00:09:12,291
One way or another, one
face will be added to the wall.

93
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:38,024
Murdered by a wild boar.

94
00:09:38,385 --> 00:09:40,824
The big hairy vagrant.

95
00:09:41,022 --> 00:09:44,179
He sank his fangs in my gut...

96
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:47,615
And quickly, do not exist anymore.

97
00:09:47,776 --> 00:09:50,493
Come, father,
must lie in bed.

98
00:09:50,813 --> 00:09:52,410
I love you, Dad.

99
00:09:52,411 --> 00:09:53,570
Please do not die.

100
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,286
Shut up, you pig!

101
00:09:55,287 --> 00:09:57,167
<i>Cersei, more wine.</i>

102
00:09:58,165 --> 00:10:01,041
I feel the winter winds
licking the earth.

103
00:10:01,322 --> 00:10:04,080
And our son alone
so cold that throne...

104
00:10:04,599 --> 00:10:05,942
Without a guiding hand.

105
00:10:06,597 --> 00:10:09,673
Who will teach you strength?
Who will teach you free?

106
00:10:09,874 --> 00:10:12,549
Who will elec
when it's time to learn...

107
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:15,428
- To look into the darkness?
- Ned Stark serve.

108
00:10:15,468 --> 00:10:17,345
Now, bring me more wine.

109
00:10:21,181 --> 00:10:23,140
What happened here anyway?

110
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,178
He brought him here, Ned Stark...

111
00:10:25,219 --> 00:10:27,894
Because you are the person
brighter land.

112
00:10:27,895 --> 00:10:31,572
You should be king of all
us and I should be your hand.

113
00:10:31,732 --> 00:10:35,647
We, Northern men are good
in keeping people in the law.

114
00:10:35,688 --> 00:10:39,444
I ask permission,
but it stinks too.

115
00:10:41,522 --> 00:10:42,865
<i>I die!</i>

116
00:10:43,239 --> 00:10:44,198
<i>I die!</i>

117
00:10:44,319 --> 00:10:47,316
And I must lie down in this place.

118
00:10:50,554 --> 00:10:51,896
No!

119
00:10:52,871 --> 00:10:56,707
I'm about to go.

120
00:10:59,185 --> 00:11:02,861
- You will be a Hand of Joffrey?
- The Iron Throne is what I demand.

121
00:11:02,901 --> 00:11:03,820
- You can not.
- I can.

122
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,059
- You can not.
- Can.

123
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:06,537
- Do not dare.
- I dare, yes.

124
00:11:06,577 --> 00:11:08,535
<i>- The line of succession.
- What does it mean?</i>

125
00:11:08,575 --> 00:11:10,574
<i>- The right progression.
- What does it mean?</i>

126
00:11:10,613 --> 00:11:12,651
- Legal rise.
- What does it mean?

127
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:29,474
Move, give me my chair
and there will be no problem.

128
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,388
We had a hung tract.

129
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:38,465
Beginning to think it is not reliable.

130
00:11:48,694 --> 00:11:50,533
Save my father.

131
00:11:50,573 --> 00:11:52,012
You really should.

132
00:11:52,052 --> 00:11:53,850
Kill the man
will not do any good.

133
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:56,167
- Save it, please.
- Show him mercy.

134
00:11:56,487 --> 00:11:58,965
<i>Show people
as a good king should be.</i>

135
00:11:59,003 --> 00:12:00,921
Good people should relax.

136
00:12:00,922 --> 00:12:02,960
The friend of my father
should be forgiven...

137
00:12:05,479 --> 00:12:07,117
<i>Father! No!</i>

138
00:12:09,234 --> 00:12:10,577
Father!

139
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:22,621
<i>Do not worry.
Everything is good.</i>

140
00:12:22,661 --> 00:12:27,137
I have here a decree
my father, Tywin Lannister...

141
00:12:27,376 --> 00:12:29,294
The richest man summer.

142
00:12:29,692 --> 00:12:31,812
He proclaims me the King's Hand.

143
00:12:32,212 --> 00:12:33,850
The position is mine forever.

144
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:38,485
And I have your permission
to marry Sansa.

145
00:12:41,201 --> 00:12:44,799
What I have high,
compensate with appetite.

146
00:12:45,038 --> 00:12:47,316
Let's forget
your predicament...

147
00:12:47,356 --> 00:12:49,434
And rehearse our wedding night.

148
00:12:59,104 --> 00:13:00,447
It is a wart.

149
00:13:00,503 --> 00:13:01,502
Two  warts.

150
00:13:01,542 --> 00:13:03,420
I have two warts
on my penis.

151
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,899
<i>Do not worry, love.</i>

152
00:13:04,939 --> 00:13:07,136
They desaperecem
in five or six years.

153
00:13:07,376 --> 00:13:10,174
Wash it, honey. Fede much.

154
00:13:10,213 --> 00:13:13,490
It may be better, Bianca,
dear. Must be.

155
00:13:13,808 --> 00:13:15,008
I have two lines.

156
00:13:15,048 --> 00:13:16,806
There are small stakes.

157
00:13:16,847 --> 00:13:19,045
- You do not convinced.
- Not convinced?

158
00:13:19,085 --> 00:13:21,922
What you need is someone
that do believe.

159
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,275
Do not complained
me last night.

160
00:13:26,276 --> 00:13:28,036
Wine would, Lady Crane?

161
00:13:28,076 --> 00:13:29,674
<i>Rum tasting, Bobono.</i>

162
00:13:30,273 --> 00:13:32,271
Need to know if we will be close.

163
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,948
Of course we will be close.

164
00:13:33,949 --> 00:13:35,428
It's just a matter of time.

165
00:13:39,864 --> 00:13:41,206
To our children.

166
00:13:41,263 --> 00:13:44,618
- With his talent.
- And your dirty mind.

167
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:52,971
Girl poison rum.

168
00:13:54,088 --> 00:13:55,888
Lady Crane
is the only one who drinks.

169
00:13:59,883 --> 00:14:02,719
If the girl could use
one of the faces of the wall...

170
00:14:03,161 --> 00:14:04,638
The girl is not ready.

171
00:14:08,116 --> 00:14:09,459
She's a good actress.

172
00:14:09,994 --> 00:14:11,336
I've heard.

173
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,789
It looks like a decent woman.

174
00:14:18,105 --> 00:14:21,342
Death only comes to bad
and ignores the good?

175
00:14:23,818 --> 00:14:25,161
No.

176
00:14:28,613 --> 00:14:29,956
Who wants her dead?

177
00:14:30,134 --> 00:14:32,450
It does not matter.
The price was paid.

178
00:14:34,849 --> 00:14:36,192
The youngest actress.

179
00:14:37,605 --> 00:14:40,123
She's jealous because
Lady Crane's best.

180
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:44,159
Girl must decide whether
serve the God of Many Faces.

181
00:14:45,758 --> 00:14:47,101
Girl decided.

182
00:14:48,276 --> 00:14:50,393
A servant does not ask questions.

183
00:15:57,406 --> 00:15:59,524
No! No!

184
00:16:22,101 --> 00:16:23,444
It was you.

185
00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:26,057
You did
the White Walkers.

186
00:16:26,338 --> 00:16:27,680
We were at war.

187
00:16:28,493 --> 00:16:30,093
<i>We were being massacred.</i>

188
00:16:30,412 --> 00:16:32,330
<i>Our trees
sacred cut.</i>

189
00:16:33,289 --> 00:16:34,849
<i>We had to defend ourselves.</i>

190
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,550
Who?

191
00:16:37,526 --> 00:16:38,868
From you.

192
00:16:40,002 --> 00:16:41,345
Of men.

193
00:16:50,074 --> 00:16:52,469
We speak in the presence
the Drowned God.

194
00:16:53,789 --> 00:16:55,348
In your name we gather today...

195
00:16:55,388 --> 00:16:58,065
To choose a new king as our leader.

196
00:16:59,065 --> 00:17:00,407
Who claims?

197
00:17:05,896 --> 00:17:07,416
I am Yara Greyjoy...

198
00:17:08,135 --> 00:17:09,733
Daughter of Balon Greyjoy...

199
00:17:10,293 --> 00:17:11,650
King of the Iron Islands.

200
00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:15,485
I claim the Throne of Sal.

201
00:17:15,486 --> 00:17:17,126
We have never had a queen.

202
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:18,126
Never.

203
00:17:18,165 --> 00:17:20,164
There are many things
ever did.

204
00:17:21,042 --> 00:17:23,159
Never leave
our mark on the world.

205
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,837
The great lords of Westeros
are not interested in us...

206
00:17:26,877 --> 00:17:29,871
Until our small invasions
go through their kingdoms...

207
00:17:29,872 --> 00:17:31,432
<i>And become a nuisance.</i>

208
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:32,895
And in the crush.

209
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:35,012
They dominate us...

210
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,731
Humiliate us...

211
00:17:37,226 --> 00:17:39,461
<i>And return to forget
we exist.</i>

212
00:17:39,462 --> 00:17:40,805
Yes!

213
00:17:41,381 --> 00:17:43,860
- We are a people of the sea.
- Yes!

214
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,737
Our God is God of the sea.

215
00:17:45,778 --> 00:17:46,737
Yes!

216
00:17:46,777 --> 00:17:49,052
When Queen
build a fleet...

217
00:17:49,053 --> 00:17:50,733
- There will be queen!
- Not finished!

218
00:17:50,772 --> 00:17:51,731
Yes, finished!

219
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,770
A woman not in the lead.

220
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:56,725
Not when the heir
the Balon own back.

221
00:18:22,619 --> 00:18:24,219
I'm Theon Greyjoy...

222
00:18:26,137 --> 00:18:28,335
Last living son
Balon Greyjoy.

223
00:18:36,367 --> 00:18:38,604
And it is their legitimate ruler.

224
00:18:38,645 --> 00:18:39,987
Yes!

225
00:18:40,323 --> 00:18:43,480
Those who sailed with her
and there are many of you here...

226
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:45,358
<i>Know who she is.</i>

227
00:18:45,398 --> 00:18:46,437
Yes!

228
00:18:46,557 --> 00:18:48,195
- It is a robber.
- Yes!

229
00:18:48,235 --> 00:18:49,913
- She's a warrior.
- Yes!

230
00:18:49,954 --> 00:18:51,390
It is an iron woman!

231
00:18:51,391 --> 00:18:52,734
Yes!

232
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:55,068
Will not find a better leader.

233
00:18:59,063 --> 00:19:00,405
This is our queen.

234
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:09,135
<i>Yara! Yara! Yara!</i>

235
00:19:09,174 --> 00:19:10,972
<i>I am Euron Greyjoy.</i>

236
00:19:12,211 --> 00:19:14,009
Claim the Throne of Sal.

237
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:26,300
Hostess.

238
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,177
Sobrinho.

239
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,054
Small Theon.

240
00:19:34,189 --> 00:19:36,906
I heard you could
ruin everything.

241
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:40,662
<i>Captured a castle
he could not keep.</i>

242
00:19:40,702 --> 00:19:42,261
He was taken prisoner.

243
00:19:43,939 --> 00:19:45,658
Until I heard you have no penis.

244
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:51,809
This explains why
supports a woman as king.

245
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:53,370
When she returned, Uncle?

246
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:54,752
<i>A few days ago.</i>

247
00:19:55,646 --> 00:19:57,366
I had to do some things.

248
00:19:58,085 --> 00:19:59,428
Outstanding things.

249
00:20:00,802 --> 00:20:02,360
I'm glad you're here.

250
00:20:04,277 --> 00:20:06,956
Now I know what I'll do
first as queen.

251
00:20:08,036 --> 00:20:10,713
Run man
who killed my father.

252
00:20:17,106 --> 00:20:18,448
I killed.

253
00:20:18,664 --> 00:20:20,007
I killed him.

254
00:20:22,061 --> 00:20:25,338
I threw a bridge
rope and saw him fall.

255
00:20:27,294 --> 00:20:29,212
<i>It did not take us anywhere...</i>

256
00:20:29,213 --> 00:20:32,012
And would remain so
if not for me.

257
00:20:32,051 --> 00:20:33,394
<i>No one loved him.</i>

258
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:34,966
<i>No one wanted to follow him.</i>

259
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,844
It took us two wars
we could not win.

260
00:20:37,845 --> 00:20:41,481
I apologize to all of you
not have killed him years ago.

261
00:20:41,522 --> 00:20:43,080
It would have been difficult.

262
00:20:43,598 --> 00:20:44,941
I was not here.

263
00:20:45,517 --> 00:20:49,351
I heard you been loitering
the world having a great time.

264
00:20:49,352 --> 00:20:50,712
Loitering?

265
00:20:51,033 --> 00:20:54,148
That's what you say when
a penis is cut?

266
00:20:54,908 --> 00:20:58,025
<i>The great lords of Westeros
taught him those words?</i>

267
00:20:58,943 --> 00:21:00,285
You were not here.

268
00:21:00,822 --> 00:21:01,820
Yara was here.

269
00:21:02,141 --> 00:21:04,858
Being Iron Man.
Leading men of iron.

270
00:21:04,898 --> 00:21:07,176
<i>Preparing for the
lead to glory.</i>

271
00:21:08,295 --> 00:21:09,638
<i>How you do it?</i>

272
00:21:10,451 --> 00:21:13,329
I will build the largest fleet
the world has ever seen.

273
00:21:15,887 --> 00:21:16,846
Good idea...

274
00:21:17,165 --> 00:21:19,924
But I who build
the Iron Fleet...

275
00:21:20,043 --> 00:21:21,960
<i>Because I know how to use it.</i>

276
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,839
<i>I've been around the world.</i>

277
00:21:23,878 --> 00:21:25,957
I saw more things
all of you together.

278
00:21:27,396 --> 00:21:28,738
And across the sea...

279
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,871
There is a person who hates
the great lords of Westeros...

280
00:21:31,911 --> 00:21:33,469
Much as we do.

281
00:21:34,309 --> 00:21:37,304
Someone with a great army,
three great dragons...

282
00:21:38,264 --> 00:21:39,607
And no husband.

283
00:21:40,182 --> 00:21:41,901
<i>I will build a fleet...</i>

284
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:46,576
Will "wander" up there
and give it to Daenerys Targaryen...

285
00:21:46,617 --> 00:21:48,055
With my big cock.

286
00:21:49,054 --> 00:21:52,411
- Tempt the Queen of Dragons?
- Not to beguile.

287
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,009
The Iron Fleet to seduce.

288
00:21:54,329 --> 00:21:56,485
And together, we will take
the Seven Kingdoms.

289
00:21:58,085 --> 00:21:59,427
I was not born to be king.

290
00:22:00,321 --> 00:22:02,002
I paid the iron price...

291
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,263
And here I am.

292
00:22:05,797 --> 00:22:09,593
Euron! Euron! Euron! Euron!

293
00:22:26,336 --> 00:22:30,732
What Euron his servant, born
again the sea as you.

294
00:22:31,172 --> 00:22:32,514
<i>Bless him with salt.</i>

295
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:34,272
<i>Bless it with stone.</i>

296
00:22:34,808 --> 00:22:36,151
<i>Bless it with steel.</i>

297
00:22:36,527 --> 00:22:37,723
<i>Listen to the waves.</i>

298
00:22:37,724 --> 00:22:39,067
<i>Listen to God.</i>

299
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,641
<i>He speaks to us and says...</i>

300
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:46,037
<i>Euron Greyjoy is the only king.</i>

301
00:22:47,196 --> 00:22:50,191
Let the sea wash
its follies and vanities.

302
00:22:50,472 --> 00:22:52,110
<i>Let the old Euron drown.</i>

303
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:54,987
<i>Let your lungs
fill with seawater.</i>

304
00:23:00,821 --> 00:23:03,618
<i>Let the fish eat
the scales from their eyes.</i>

305
00:23:03,819 --> 00:23:06,137
<i>What you are dead
can not die...</i>

306
00:23:06,377 --> 00:23:08,974
<i>But returns to rise,
harder and stronger.</i>

307
00:24:14,229 --> 00:24:16,505
What is dead
can not die.

308
00:24:16,586 --> 00:24:19,104
What is dead
can not die.

309
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:34,727
Where are my nephews?

310
00:24:40,323 --> 00:24:41,665
Let's kill them.

311
00:25:01,462 --> 00:25:03,380
<i>They stole our best
boats.</i>

312
00:25:04,738 --> 00:25:07,176
Will not be enough
to save them.

313
00:25:08,294 --> 00:25:09,637
Get back to their homes.

314
00:25:10,492 --> 00:25:13,011
Cut all the trees
find.

315
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:15,127
Serrem wood
and start building.

316
00:25:15,608 --> 00:25:17,883
I want all men
bending beams.

317
00:25:17,884 --> 00:25:20,802
I want all women
winding linen for masts.

318
00:25:20,841 --> 00:25:24,878
Build thousand ships
and give them this world.

319
00:25:44,099 --> 00:25:46,655
I bani, twice.

320
00:25:47,615 --> 00:25:50,491
You came back twice.

321
00:25:54,129 --> 00:25:55,471
And you saved my life.

322
00:26:00,081 --> 00:26:02,080
So, I can not
welcome you back...

323
00:26:02,201 --> 00:26:03,918
And I can not send him away.

324
00:26:06,557 --> 00:26:08,075
You should send me away.

325
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,523
Is there a cure?

326
00:26:23,739 --> 00:26:25,082
I do not know.

327
00:26:26,496 --> 00:26:27,839
How long does it take?

328
00:26:28,973 --> 00:26:30,316
I do not know well.

329
00:26:30,851 --> 00:26:33,370
But I've seen what happens when
progresses.

330
00:26:34,607 --> 00:26:35,949
I'll finish everything before.

331
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,066
Sorry.

332
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,679
Sorry, really.

333
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,062
Do not apologize.

334
00:26:45,917 --> 00:26:48,033
All I ever wanted was
serve it.

335
00:26:51,591 --> 00:26:53,349
Tyrion Lannister was right.

336
00:26:56,665 --> 00:26:58,007
I love.

337
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:04,762
Always will.

338
00:27:09,693 --> 00:27:11,036
Goodbye, khaleesi.

339
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,684
Do not leave your queen...

340
00:27:18,843 --> 00:27:20,186
Jorah, the Andalo.

341
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,477
It was not released yet.

342
00:27:26,636 --> 00:27:28,275
You swore loyalty.

343
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:32,149
Sworn to obey my commands
for the rest of your life.

344
00:27:34,068 --> 00:27:36,027
<i>Well, I order
to find a cure...</i>

345
00:27:37,625 --> 00:27:39,503
<i>Wherever you are
in this world.</i>

346
00:27:42,341 --> 00:27:44,219
I order you to heal...

347
00:27:45,977 --> 00:27:47,455
<i>, Then return to me.</i>

348
00:27:50,572 --> 00:27:52,290
When taking the Seven Kingdoms...

349
00:27:53,649 --> 00:27:55,327
Need you by my side.

350
00:28:33,089 --> 00:28:36,327
In the last fortnight since
our pact with the Masters...

351
00:28:36,366 --> 00:28:38,285
How many murders were committed...

352
00:28:38,323 --> 00:28:39,666
The Sons of the Harpy?

353
00:28:40,163 --> 00:28:41,082
No.

354
00:28:41,281 --> 00:28:44,158
How many Masters were killed by
free men?

355
00:28:44,198 --> 00:28:46,436
Two... but it was the day of the covenant.

356
00:28:46,477 --> 00:28:47,819
<i>Since then, nothing.</i>

357
00:28:48,115 --> 00:28:51,151
It is safe to say that peace reigned.

358
00:28:51,351 --> 00:28:52,694
For now.

359
00:28:52,708 --> 00:28:54,747
It is the best we have
in our profession.

360
00:28:54,788 --> 00:28:55,787
It's not enough.

361
00:28:55,826 --> 00:28:57,705
We were
edge of civil war...

362
00:28:57,744 --> 00:28:59,422
I say it's a good start.

363
00:28:59,662 --> 00:29:01,980
It's not enough
Meereen to have peace.

364
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:05,177
Need to know that Daenerys
is responsible for it.

365
00:29:05,217 --> 00:29:07,576
The Sons of the Harpy
have a good story.

366
00:29:07,615 --> 00:29:09,653
Resist foreign invaders
.

367
00:29:09,693 --> 00:29:11,888
Our Queen has
a better story.

368
00:29:11,889 --> 00:29:14,648
Mother of Dragons,
breaker chains and...

369
00:29:15,407 --> 00:29:16,327
Everything.

370
00:29:16,684 --> 00:29:18,843
They know who brought them freedom.

371
00:29:18,884 --> 00:29:21,281
Yes, but they know who
gave them security?

372
00:29:21,402 --> 00:29:23,240
Who put an end to violence?

373
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:26,274
We need someone
they trust...

374
00:29:26,275 --> 00:29:29,633
Someone know that can not be bought or influenced
.

375
00:29:29,673 --> 00:29:30,912
<i>It looks like a hero.</i>

376
00:29:30,952 --> 00:29:32,295
Where to find him?

377
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:34,388
Who said it would be "it"?

378
00:29:36,347 --> 00:29:38,464
You are in the presence
Kinvara...

379
00:29:39,543 --> 00:29:42,461
High Priestess of the Temple
Red Volantis...

380
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,979
The Flame of Truth...

381
00:29:44,019 --> 00:29:45,696
The Light of Wisdom...

382
00:29:45,737 --> 00:29:49,093
First
Servant of the Lord of Light.

383
00:29:55,046 --> 00:29:58,125
Welcome to Meereen.

384
00:30:00,043 --> 00:30:02,040
That's all I know Valyrian.

385
00:30:08,754 --> 00:30:10,512
Thank you for coming here.

386
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:14,788
I've tried and I know
travel can be uncomfortable.

387
00:30:19,783 --> 00:30:21,899
The truth is that we need
your help.

388
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,498
We expected at least persuade her to...

389
00:30:25,537 --> 00:30:27,016
Do not need to persuade me.

390
00:30:27,615 --> 00:30:28,958
I came to help.

391
00:30:29,533 --> 00:30:32,211
Born Daenerys of the Storm
is who was promised.

392
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:35,727
The fire she was reborn
to remake the world.

393
00:30:36,886 --> 00:30:38,229
Yes.

394
00:30:38,524 --> 00:30:40,722
It freed the slaves
chains...

395
00:30:40,762 --> 00:30:43,039
And crucified the Masters
for their sins.

396
00:30:43,957 --> 00:30:45,300
Yes, she did.

397
00:30:45,717 --> 00:30:48,034
Your dragons are
fire made of flesh...

398
00:30:48,634 --> 00:30:50,272
The Lord's gift of light.

399
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:52,790
But I have heard that before, right?

400
00:30:53,548 --> 00:30:55,307
In Long Bridge Volantis.

401
00:30:57,825 --> 00:31:00,742
<i>The cleanse dragons
thousands of non-believers...</i>

402
00:31:01,181 --> 00:31:03,138
Burning their sins
and bodies.

403
00:31:04,097 --> 00:31:07,575
Preferably flirted
purify many non-believers.

404
00:31:08,334 --> 00:31:11,091
The Mother of Dragons has
followers of different faiths.

405
00:31:11,132 --> 00:31:14,248
You want your queen
be honored and accepted.

406
00:31:14,368 --> 00:31:16,965
And while no
want their advisers...

407
00:31:17,006 --> 00:31:18,843
Are revered and heeded.

408
00:31:19,802 --> 00:31:21,720
I'm glad to "heeded".

409
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,638
<i>I will call
my most eloquent priests.</i>

410
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:26,515
They will tell everyone.

411
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:30,949
Daenerys was sent to lead the people
against the darkness...

412
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:34,786
This war and great
war that will follow.

413
00:31:35,027 --> 00:31:36,227
Excellent.

414
00:31:36,266 --> 00:31:39,344
A man named Stannis Baratheon
was anointed...

415
00:31:39,383 --> 00:31:41,981
As the chosen one of its priestesses.

416
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:44,617
It also
had a glorious destiny.

417
00:31:45,218 --> 00:31:48,095
He attacked Port Royal
and was defeated...

418
00:31:48,135 --> 00:31:49,932
For this man beside me.

419
00:31:50,372 --> 00:31:52,809
I heard that he had been defeated
again...

420
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:54,528
This time in Winterfell...

421
00:31:55,087 --> 00:31:56,806
And this time forever.

422
00:31:56,844 --> 00:32:00,002
We would appreciate any support
which could give the queen.

423
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:02,879
I find it hard to
a fanatic admit a mistake.

424
00:32:03,239 --> 00:32:05,716
That is what
be a fanatic, no?

425
00:32:06,276 --> 00:32:08,034
You are always right.

426
00:32:08,554 --> 00:32:10,952
It is the Lord's will.

427
00:32:12,189 --> 00:32:13,709
It is the Lord's will.

428
00:32:14,988 --> 00:32:16,984
But men and women
make mistakes.

429
00:32:17,825 --> 00:32:19,663
Until honest servants of the Lord.

430
00:32:19,703 --> 00:32:22,420
And you, a servant of the Lord
honest...

431
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,736
Why should trust
on you to find out more...

432
00:32:25,776 --> 00:32:27,894
The priestess
who advised Stannis?

433
00:32:27,934 --> 00:32:33,288
My friend is skeptical of religion,
but faithfully support the queen.

434
00:32:38,324 --> 00:32:42,080
All are what they are, and are
where they are for a reason.

435
00:32:44,078 --> 00:32:46,596
Things terrible
happen for a reason.

436
00:32:47,673 --> 00:32:51,191
See what happened to you,
Lord Varys, when I was little.

437
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:55,866
<i>If not for his mutilation
by a sorcerer second...</i>

438
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:57,249
<i>Would not be here...</i>

439
00:32:57,504 --> 00:33:00,622
<i>Helping the Lord Chosen
bring your light to the world.</i>

440
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,178
The knowledge gave him power.

441
00:33:05,895 --> 00:33:08,214
But there is so much
do not know.

442
00:33:10,492 --> 00:33:12,608
<i>Remember
what he heard that night...</i>

443
00:33:13,567 --> 00:33:16,444
<i>When the sorcerer played their parts
on fire?</i>

444
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:22,000
You heard a voice from the flames.
Do you remember?

445
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:26,436
I must tell you
what the voice said?

446
00:33:28,274 --> 00:33:31,312
I must tell you the name
who spoke?

447
00:33:40,941 --> 00:33:42,339
We serve the same queen.

448
00:33:43,298 --> 00:33:47,335
If you are your true friend,
has nothing to fear from me.

449
00:37:14,209 --> 00:37:16,046
He saw me, the King of the Night!

450
00:37:16,127 --> 00:37:17,086
<i>He saw me!</i>

451
00:37:17,125 --> 00:37:18,468
It touched.

452
00:37:20,002 --> 00:37:21,760
I do not know. It was close, but...

453
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,143
It touched.

454
00:37:25,757 --> 00:37:27,954
He knows he's here.
Will come after you.

455
00:37:28,354 --> 00:37:29,696
But he can not enter.

456
00:37:29,792 --> 00:37:31,135
It can now.

457
00:37:31,271 --> 00:37:32,669
<i>Your brand is you.</i>

458
00:37:33,309 --> 00:37:34,947
You must leave all of you.

459
00:37:39,103 --> 00:37:41,062
<i>Come on, Hodor,
help me with the sled.</i>

460
00:37:41,101 --> 00:37:42,444
Hodor.

461
00:37:42,779 --> 00:37:44,537
Sorry. It was not on purpose.

462
00:37:44,738 --> 00:37:45,896
The time has come.

463
00:37:46,015 --> 00:37:47,358
Time for what?

464
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,772
For you to be me.

465
00:37:51,571 --> 00:37:52,530
But...

466
00:37:52,849 --> 00:37:54,192
I'm ready?

467
00:37:55,327 --> 00:37:56,669
No.

468
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:02,238
We can not defend the north of
Walkers and the southern Boltons.

469
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,318
To survive
need Winterfell...

470
00:38:04,358 --> 00:38:07,035
And to take Winterfell,
we need more men.

471
00:38:10,431 --> 00:38:14,706
<i>Outside the Starks and the Boltons,
the most powerful in North...</i>

472
00:38:15,466 --> 00:38:18,224
Are Umbers, the Karstarks,
and Manderlys.

473
00:38:19,103 --> 00:38:23,659
The Umbers and Karstarks already
are in favor of the Boltons.

474
00:38:23,698 --> 00:38:25,137
What it is not good for us.

475
00:38:25,255 --> 00:38:27,534
The Umbers gave Rickon
to our enemies.

476
00:38:27,615 --> 00:38:28,533
I hope they die.

477
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:30,492
But Karstarks
allied to Ramsay...

478
00:38:30,532 --> 00:38:33,209
Without knowing they had no choice.

479
00:38:33,609 --> 00:38:37,964
Sorry, but you know what
one Stark beheaded their father.

480
00:38:38,004 --> 00:38:40,442
I think we can not
rely on them too.

481
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,758
You know well
the North, Sir Davos?

482
00:38:44,278 --> 00:38:45,395
Very little, my lady.

483
00:38:45,597 --> 00:38:48,272
<i>My father said that Northerners are different.</i>

484
00:38:48,594 --> 00:38:49,936
More loyal...

485
00:38:49,992 --> 00:38:51,550
<i>More suspicious of outsiders.</i>

486
00:38:52,031 --> 00:38:53,068
Can be loyal...

487
00:38:53,308 --> 00:38:55,827
But how many were
against the Boltons...

488
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:57,785
When betrayed your family?

489
00:38:59,143 --> 00:39:02,420
I may not know
the North, but I know men.

490
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,575
They are like any
in the world...

491
00:39:04,576 --> 00:39:06,456
And even the bravest...

492
00:39:06,535 --> 00:39:09,370
Not want to see their wives and children
flayed...

493
00:39:09,371 --> 00:39:10,731
For a lost cause.

494
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:14,128
If Jon is convince them
to fight at your side...

495
00:39:14,166 --> 00:39:16,286
They need to believe
is a fight that will win.

496
00:39:16,325 --> 00:39:18,243
There are three
homes in North...

497
00:39:18,284 --> 00:39:20,802
Glover, Mormont, Cerwyn...

498
00:39:21,281 --> 00:39:22,623
<i>Mazin, Hornwood.</i>

499
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,758
And two dozen more.

500
00:39:23,918 --> 00:39:25,876
Together, the sum is equal
others.

501
00:39:26,396 --> 00:39:28,552
We can start small and increase
.

502
00:39:28,593 --> 00:39:29,936
<i>The North remembers.</i>

503
00:39:30,671 --> 00:39:32,387
He remembers the Stark name.

504
00:39:32,388 --> 00:39:36,026
The people risk everything Porto
White to Ramsay House.

505
00:39:36,225 --> 00:39:37,568
I do not doubt.

506
00:39:38,864 --> 00:39:40,341
But Jon is not named Stark.

507
00:39:40,382 --> 00:39:41,724
No, but I have.

508
00:39:45,815 --> 00:39:49,332
Jon is the son of Ned Stark
as Ramsay is Roose Bolton.

509
00:39:49,772 --> 00:39:50,971
<i>And we have Tullys.</i>

510
00:39:51,011 --> 00:39:54,567
<i>There are northerners, but the
support against the Boltons.</i>

511
00:39:54,607 --> 00:39:56,364
I did not know yet
had an army.

512
00:39:56,365 --> 00:39:59,563
My uncle, the Blackfish, the
rebuilt and resumed Riverrun.

513
00:40:00,522 --> 00:40:01,864
How do you know?

514
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,955
Ramsay received a crow before
I escape from Winterfell.

515
00:40:07,795 --> 00:40:09,138
That's good.

516
00:40:09,752 --> 00:40:12,789
The Blackfish is a legend.
Your support would mean a lot.

517
00:40:13,868 --> 00:40:16,504
Stark, Tully,
some other houses...

518
00:40:17,145 --> 00:40:19,103
Is beginning to smell victory.

519
00:40:21,299 --> 00:40:23,216
I swore to protect her, milady.

520
00:40:23,217 --> 00:40:24,176
You heard them.

521
00:40:24,177 --> 00:40:27,052
We need more men
and my uncle has an army.

522
00:40:27,053 --> 00:40:28,971
We can send a raven to Blackfish.

523
00:40:28,972 --> 00:40:33,568
Ramsay can intercept.
Must be you. Go to Riverrun.

524
00:40:33,608 --> 00:40:36,406
My uncle will speak to you
and know how to talk to him.

525
00:40:39,043 --> 00:40:40,386
What?

526
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,078
I do not like to leave her alone.

527
00:40:44,118 --> 00:40:45,038
With Jon?

528
00:40:45,275 --> 00:40:46,234
No, he.

529
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,578
It seems reliable.

530
00:40:48,152 --> 00:40:49,495
A little thoughtful.

531
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:51,950
It is perhaps understandable.

532
00:40:53,509 --> 00:40:54,851
Yet others.

533
00:40:57,743 --> 00:40:58,782
Davos and Red Woman...

534
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:01,221
Helped a man kill his own brother...

535
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:02,979
With blood magic.

536
00:41:03,019 --> 00:41:05,536
<i>And when Stannis
paid for his crime, where were they?</i>

537
00:41:05,576 --> 00:41:08,292
Why there looking
a better leader.

538
00:41:09,652 --> 00:41:11,570
And that Wild bearded...

539
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:12,953
Jon is not Tormund.

540
00:41:13,129 --> 00:41:15,964
Jon is not Davos,
the Red Woman or Stannis.

541
00:41:15,965 --> 00:41:17,308
Jon is Jon.

542
00:41:18,084 --> 00:41:21,161
He's my brother. He will keep me safe
. I trust him.

543
00:41:24,158 --> 00:41:28,593
So why lie when
asked about Riverrun?

544
00:41:36,426 --> 00:41:37,768
New dress?

545
00:41:38,583 --> 00:41:40,621
I sewed the same.
You like him?

546
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,242
Yes, it's...

547
00:41:42,259 --> 00:41:43,777
I like the part of the wolf.

548
00:41:44,897 --> 00:41:48,572
Good,
because I did it for you.

549
00:41:51,411 --> 00:41:53,608
<i>I did like what Dad used to use
.</i>

550
00:41:54,407 --> 00:41:55,886
Well, as I recall.

551
00:41:58,323 --> 00:41:59,666
Thank you, Sansa.

552
00:42:00,081 --> 00:42:01,424
You're welcome.

553
00:42:21,141 --> 00:42:23,097
Do not drop,
while I'm gone.

554
00:42:23,098 --> 00:42:24,441
I will do my best.

555
00:42:30,451 --> 00:42:31,794
Good luck.

556
00:43:02,418 --> 00:43:04,897
We should close the gate,
Lord Commander?

557
00:43:04,937 --> 00:43:06,280
I am Lord Coman...

558
00:43:11,049 --> 00:43:12,392
Yes...

559
00:43:13,328 --> 00:43:14,885
Close the damn door.

560
00:43:26,515 --> 00:43:28,473
<i>Can we go
home now, Hodor.</i>

561
00:43:28,793 --> 00:43:32,509
Not home, but some
place than a cave.

562
00:43:33,309 --> 00:43:34,268
Hodor.

563
00:43:34,307 --> 00:43:35,984
Eat something
than moss.

564
00:43:38,384 --> 00:43:39,727
I want an egg.

565
00:43:39,941 --> 00:43:40,900
How would you like?

566
00:43:41,221 --> 00:43:42,340
Cooked?

567
00:43:42,379 --> 00:43:43,722
Fried with butter?

568
00:43:44,098 --> 00:43:45,440
Hodor.

569
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:48,573
With <i> Bacon </i> and sausage.

570
00:43:48,613 --> 00:43:49,956
Hodor.

571
00:44:47,912 --> 00:44:49,255
Take Bran and run!

572
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:03,257
Bran. Bran, wake up.

573
00:45:03,738 --> 00:45:06,096
- Bran.
- Hodor. Hodor.

574
00:45:06,375 --> 00:45:07,717
Bran, wake up.

575
00:45:17,643 --> 00:45:20,721
<i>- The gods keep you on the road.
- Calm. Caution.</i>

576
00:45:24,837 --> 00:45:25,796
Hodor.

577
00:45:25,836 --> 00:45:27,634
Hodor. Hodor.

578
00:45:29,073 --> 00:45:30,416
Help me!

579
00:45:48,893 --> 00:45:50,236
<i>Go!</i>

580
00:45:50,851 --> 00:45:52,194
Go!

581
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:39,442
<i>Remember that is a Stark.</i>

582
00:46:40,042 --> 00:46:42,039
Behave with dignity in the Valley...

583
00:46:42,997 --> 00:46:44,637
And try to stay away from fights.

584
00:46:44,677 --> 00:46:46,020
Yes, father.

585
00:46:48,073 --> 00:46:49,416
But if you have to fight...

586
00:46:49,991 --> 00:46:51,334
Win.

587
00:46:52,828 --> 00:46:54,506
Bran! Bran, wake up!

588
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:07,958
Bran!

589
00:47:08,093 --> 00:47:09,252
Bran! Bran, wake up.

590
00:47:09,292 --> 00:47:11,570
- Hodor. Hodor.
- Bran! Bran, wake up!

591
00:47:18,084 --> 00:47:19,163
You must wake up.

592
00:47:19,203 --> 00:47:21,320
- We need Hodor.
- Hodor. Hodor.

593
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:24,197
<i>Bran, Hodor need.
Bran, you must agree.</i>

594
00:47:24,236 --> 00:47:25,579
<i>We need Hodor.</i>

595
00:47:27,914 --> 00:47:29,392
Hodor. Hodor.

596
00:47:38,104 --> 00:47:39,463
Bran, all die!

597
00:47:39,782 --> 00:47:41,125
<i>Bran, wake up!</i>

598
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:42,340
<i>We will die all!</i>

599
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:43,723
<i>Bran! Bran!</i>

600
00:47:44,697 --> 00:47:46,975
Bran, you must agree.
We need Hodor.

601
00:47:47,015 --> 00:47:48,094
Hodor. Hodor.

602
00:47:48,134 --> 00:47:49,477
Control Hodor now!

603
00:47:50,012 --> 00:47:52,048
<i>Bran, wake up.
We need Hodor.</i>

604
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:55,407
<i>We need Hodor.
Control Hodor now! Now!</i>

605
00:47:55,606 --> 00:47:57,164
Listen to your friend, Brandon.

606
00:47:58,922 --> 00:48:00,442
<i>Hodor. Hodor.</i>

607
00:48:00,561 --> 00:48:01,919
<i>Hodor. Hodor.</i>

608
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:03,502
Hodor. Hodor.

609
00:48:38,082 --> 00:48:39,041
Summer!

610
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:40,384
<i>Go.</i>

611
00:48:40,801 --> 00:48:42,143
Go!

612
00:49:18,523 --> 00:49:19,866
<i>It's time.</i>

613
00:49:22,519 --> 00:49:23,862
Let me.

614
00:49:49,492 --> 00:49:50,611
What are you doing?

615
00:49:50,651 --> 00:49:51,994
Go!

616
00:50:38,443 --> 00:50:39,786
Hodor, fast!

617
00:50:40,401 --> 00:50:41,744
Hodor!

618
00:50:59,621 --> 00:51:00,964
Hold the door!

619
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:03,363
<i>Hold the door!</i>

620
00:51:07,294 --> 00:51:08,637
<i>Hold the door!</i>

621
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:12,513
<i>Hold the door!</i>

622
00:51:21,319 --> 00:51:22,662
Hold the door!

623
00:51:29,672 --> 00:51:31,015
<i>- Hold the door</i>
- Wylis!

624
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:32,549
What?

625
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:33,988
<i>Hold the door!</i>

626
00:51:34,027 --> 00:51:35,370
Come on, son.

627
00:51:35,546 --> 00:51:37,104
Hold the door!

628
00:51:42,938 --> 00:51:44,281
Hold the door!

629
00:51:44,976 --> 00:51:46,319
Hold the door!
