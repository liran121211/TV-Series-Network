- Why not?

- If your father--
- He'll never know
we're gone.

5
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:14,733
But if he finds out...

6
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:21,140
You don't need
to be afraid of my father.

Yes.

10

- No.

Listen to your friend.

16

They said that you
were terrifying

17

and three eyes.

18
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:55,968
You're not terrifying.

19
00:03:56,704 --> 00:03:58,403
You're boring.

20
00:03:58,405 --> 00:03:59,972
You don't know
what I am.

21
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:04,710
I know you're a witch

22

Tell me mine.

23
00:04:07,014 --> 00:04:09,514
Everyone wants
to know their future

24
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:11,383
until they know
their future.

25
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:14,419
This is my father's land.
My land.

26
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:18,857
Tell me my future
or I'll have your
two boring eyes

27
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:20,692
gouged out of your head.

28
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:23,295
( chuckles )

29
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:32,604
Your blood.

30
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,806
Give me a taste.

31
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:47,786
( whimpers )

32
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:01,533
Three questions you get.

33
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:04,970
You won't like
the answers.

34
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:11,710
I've been promised
to the prince.

35
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:13,378
When will we marry?

36
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,547
You will never
wed the prince.

37
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:17,449
You will wed the king.

38
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:19,384
But I will be queen?

39
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:21,520
Oh, yes.

40
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:24,022
You'll be queen.

41
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:26,491
For a time.

42
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:29,094
Then comes another,

43
00:05:29,096 --> 00:05:30,395
younger,

44
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:32,097

00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:38,804
W-will the king and I
have children?

47
00:05:38,806 --> 00:05:43,375
No. The king
will have 20 children

48
00:05:43,377 --> 00:05:44,643
and you will have three.

49
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:45,811
That doesn't make sense.

50
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:49,381
Gold will be their crowns.

51
00:05:49,383 --> 00:05:52,818
Gold their shrouds.

52
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:57,756

53
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,959

65
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:51,076
They will keep waiting.

66
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:52,177
I want a moment
alone with him.

67
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:54,946
But, Your Grace,
many of these lords
and ladies have travelled

68
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:58,150
day and night
to be here from
all seven kingdoms.

69
00:06:58,152 --> 00:07:00,485
They will wait.

70
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,057
<i>( door closes )</i>

71
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:08,527
<i>( footsteps echoing )</i>

72
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,213
He never wanted you
to be a Kingsguard,

73
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:33,218
but here you are,
protecting his dead body.

74
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:39,524
What he built, it's ours.

75
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:43,195
He built it for us.
He meant it for us.

76
00:07:44,198 --> 00:07:46,198
They're going to try
to take it away.

77
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,232
- All of it.
- They?

78
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:49,601
All of them out there,
our enemies.

79
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:52,604
They're waiting
in line to make sure
he's really dead.

80
00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:54,573
And as soon as they see
the stones on his eyes,

81
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:56,575
they'll set to work
on tearing us apart.

82
00:07:56,577 --> 00:07:58,844
They have nothing
to do with it.

83
00:07:58,846 --> 00:08:01,213
The man who
murdered our father,
he tore us apart.

84
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:03,815
He's the enemy.
I've been telling
you for years.

85
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,550
You've been defending
him for years.

86
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:07,185
This is exactly
what they want.

87
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:08,253
And now our father
is dead

88
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:13,158
and that little monster
is out there somewhere
drawing breath.

89
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,596
Did you set him free?

90
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:20,765
Tyrion may be a monster,

91
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:25,070
but at least he killed
our father on purpose.

92
00:08:25,072 --> 00:08:27,205
You killed him
by mistake.

93
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:30,108
With stupidity.

94
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,610
You're a man
of action, aren't you?

95
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:34,212
When it occurs to you
to do something, you do it.

96
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:38,183
Never mind
the consequences.

97
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:42,120
Take a look.

98
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:44,823
Look at the consequences.

99
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:48,860
Here they are.

100
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:55,934

anyone in this world.

111
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:30,128
Apologies.

112
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,307
I still don't see
why I had to stay

113
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:45,810
in this fucking crate
once we set sail.

114
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,345
I saved your life.

115
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:50,048
If they catch you,
they catch me.

I cannot say
I feel overly guilty

117
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:54,085
about leaving you
in that fucking crate.

118
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:57,055
Do you know what it's like
to stuff your shit

119
00:10:57,057 --> 00:10:58,923
through one
of those airholes?

120
00:10:58,925 --> 00:11:00,725
No, I only know
what it's like

121
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:04,062
to pick up your shit
and throw it overboard.

122
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:08,700
Pentos?

123
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:12,704
The home
of my colleague
Illyrio Mopatis,

124
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:13,738
a merchant.

125
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,774
He and I met
many years ago

126
00:11:15,776 --> 00:11:17,442
through mutual friends.

127
00:11:17,444 --> 00:11:20,345
A group of people
who saw Robert Baratheon

128
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,313
for the disaster he was.

129
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:24,783
We tried to do what
was best for the realm

130
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:28,286
by supporting
a Targaryen restoration.

131
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:31,056
And thus began
the chain of mistakes

132
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:33,324
that has led us
both here.

133
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:36,928
Things have
gotten worse,
not better.

134
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:41,132
Westeros needs to be
saved from itself.

135
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:46,371
Mmm.

136
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:48,006
Much better.

137
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:49,974
My lord?

138
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:54,345
I don't think
I am anymore.

139
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:57,015
A lord.

140
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:07,992
Are you a lord
if you kill your father?

141
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:12,230
I don't imagine
they revoke your nobility

142
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,732
for killing a whore.

143
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:15,133
It must happen
all the time.

144
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:17,936
You already drank yourself
across the Narrow Sea.

145
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:19,738
In a box.
Why stop now?

146
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:24,142
Because we are talking
about the future
of our country.

147
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,949
The future is shit.

148
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:34,953
Just like the past.

Daenerys:
<i>The Sons of the Harpy?</i>

161
00:15:43,043 --> 00:15:45,410
Yes, Your Grace.
They left it on the body.

162
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:46,678
They've never
killed before.

163
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,247
It was only a matter
of time, Your Grace.

164
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:51,382
Conquerors always meet
with resistance.

165
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:54,252
I didn't conquer them.
Their own people did.

166

( speaking Valyrian )

167
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:04,595
He did not risk his life
fighting for his freedom

168
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:06,197
so cowards in masks
could take it away.

169
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:08,533
And I did not take up
residence in this pyramid

170
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:12,704
so I could
watch the city below
decline into chaos.

171
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:15,506
What was the name
of the man you lost?

172
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:17,709
White Rat,
Your Grace.

173
00:16:17,711 --> 00:16:22,280
I want him buried
with honor, publically

174
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:24,082
in the Temple
of the Graces.

175
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:27,018
The Sons of the Harpy
will hear that message.

176
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,486
Make them very angry.

177
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,088
Angry snakes lash out.

178
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:32,657
Makes chopping
off their heads
that much easier.

179
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:37,395
Find the men who did this
and bring them to me.

180
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,700
Your Grace.

181
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:57,482
Torgo Nudho.

182
00:16:57,484 --> 00:17:00,051
Missandei hin Naath.

183
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:03,588
I wanted
to speak with you.

184
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:13,731
Why do you come?

185
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:17,635
White Rat,
the Unsullied who...

186
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:23,274
I have heard they found
his body in a brothel.

187
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:26,210
I have heard that
more than one Unsullied

188
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:30,081
has been known to visit
Meereen's brothels.

189
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,652
May I ask you why?

190
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:38,656
Why would an Unsullied
go to a brothel?

191
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:45,163
I do not know.

192
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:48,666
<i>I must go.</i>

193
00:17:57,777 --> 00:17:59,777
( shouts, grunting )

194
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:05,516
- Get your shield up.
- It's too heavy.

195
00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:07,718
If it wasn't heavy,
it wouldn't stop a sword.

196
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,687
Now get it up.

197
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,801
Come.
Try it again.

198
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:26,838
Drive at me.
Keep your shield up.

199
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,407
Or I'll ring
your head like a bell.

200
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:32,310
Shouldn't you
be training, too?

201
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:36,814
Well, I'm hardly
a new recruit.

202
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:41,552
How many brothers
can say that they've killed
a white walker and a Thenn?

203
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:43,287
I might be the first
in history.

204
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:46,324
- Man:<i> Shield up.</i>
- Alliser:<i> These men</i>
<i>need a firm hand.</i>

205
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:47,692
Always have.

206
00:18:47,694 --> 00:18:51,562
They're poachers
and thieves.

207
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,233
Not soldiers.

208
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,807
That one hates me.

209
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:05,877
Sam: If Ser Alliser
is chosen as the new
Lord Commander...

210
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:09,847
- He hates the wildlings.
-<i> ( baby fussing )</i>

211
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:11,149
All the wildlings.

212
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:13,217
- Don't let them send us away.
-<i> It's not a sure thing.</i>

213
00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:16,754
Ser Denys Mallister
has commanded the Shadow
Tower for 20 years

214
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:18,489
and people say
he's a good man.

215
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:19,790
He's running against
Ser Alliser--

216
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:22,827
Sam, don't let them
send us away.

217
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,562
I told you.

218
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:26,664
Wherever you go,
I go, too.

219
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,800
You can't leave.
They'll execute you.

220
00:19:35,942 --> 00:19:40,611
- Good, good, pivot.
Don't forget to pivot.
- Yah!

221
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,581
Shield up.

222
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,951
The king wants a word.

223
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:53,958
( chains rattling )

224
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:03,734
( wind howling )

225
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:16,447
You're not cold,
my lady?

226
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:18,583
Never.

227
00:20:18,585 --> 00:20:22,820
The Lord's fire lives
within me, Jon Snow.

228
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:27,458
Feel.

229
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:36,534
Are you a virgin?

230
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,973
No.

231
00:20:43,543 --> 00:20:45,543
Good.

232
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:53,884
Your Grace.

233
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:56,854
The bastard
of Winterfell.

234
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:07,932
You know who rules
at Winterfell now?

235
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:08,899
Roose Bolton.

236
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:13,938
Mmm, the traitor
who plunged a dagger
in Robb Stark's heart.

237
00:21:14,841 --> 00:21:17,408
Don't you want
to avenge him?

238
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:20,578
I want a great
many things, Your Grace.

239
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:23,281
But I'm a sworn brother
of the Night's Watch now.

240
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:26,484
I've been talking
to your sworn brothers.

241
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:28,853
- Many of them love you.
- They're good men.

242
00:21:28,855 --> 00:21:29,620
<i>Many don't.</i>

243
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:34,959
You were seen taking
the body of a wildling
girl north of the Wall.

244
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:36,294
<i>Why?</i>

245
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:37,695
It's where she belonged.

246
00:21:37,697 --> 00:21:39,463
Some of the Night's
Watch feel you have

247
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,065
too much affection
for the wildlings.

248
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:43,901
They were born
on the wrong side
of the Wall.

249
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:46,537
That doesn't
make them monsters.

250
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:47,371
No matter.

251
00:21:47,373 --> 00:21:48,639
I shall take back
the North

252
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:49,840
from the thieves
who stole it.

253
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:52,443
Tywin Lannister is dead.
He can't protect them now.

254
00:21:52,445 --> 00:21:55,980
I shall mount
Roose Bolton's head
on a spike.

255
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:58,316
But if
I'm to take Winterfell,
I need more men.

256
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:01,652
The men of the Night's Watch
are sworn to play no part--

257
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,921
I'm not talking about
the damn Night's Watch.

258
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:06,857
I'm talking about
the wildlings.

259
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:17,868
Your Grace,
you want the wildlings

260
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,503
to march in your army?

261
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,539
If they swear
to follow me,
I'll pardon them.

262
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:23,541
We'll take Winterfell.
Once the North is won,

263
00:22:23,543 --> 00:22:25,543
I'll declare them
citizens of the realm.

264
00:22:25,545 --> 00:22:27,645
I'll give them
land to live on.

265
00:22:27,647 --> 00:22:30,748
It's a fair offer.
More than fair.

266
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,650
I'll offer them their lives
and their freedom

267
00:22:32,652 --> 00:22:36,053
if Mance kneels before me
and swears his loyalty.

268
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:38,622
I don't think
that's likely.

269
00:22:39,392 --> 00:22:41,359
You admire him,
don't you?

270
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:43,627
- I respect him.
- He likes you.

271
00:22:43,629 --> 00:22:46,430
- Convince him
to bend the knee...
- Your Grace.

272
00:22:46,432 --> 00:22:48,366
...or he burns.

273
00:22:50,837 --> 00:22:53,404
How much time
do I have?

274
00:22:53,406 --> 00:22:54,138
Nightfall.

275
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:57,041
The sun drops fast
this time of year.

276
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:59,710
<i>Hurry, Jon Snow.</i>

277
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:01,946
( boys grunting )

278
00:23:01,948 --> 00:23:03,647
Master-of-arms:
<i>Shield up.</i>

279
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:07,017
- ( Robin whimpers )
- Master-of-arms:<i> Attack,</i>
<i>my lord!</i>

280
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:08,619
Attack!

281
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:11,122
- Don't cross your feet.
- ( grunts )

282
00:23:11,124 --> 00:23:12,590
My sons had swords
in their hands

283
00:23:12,592 --> 00:23:14,058
from the time
they could walk.
This one...

284
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:17,061
Littlefinger:
<i>Lord Arryn will never</i>
<i>be a great warrior.</i>

285
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:18,696
Royce:
<i>Great warrior?</i>

286
00:23:18,698 --> 00:23:22,099
He swings a sword
like a girl with palsy.

287
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:24,168
My lord.

288
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:26,170
Master-of-arms:
<i>Sword up, my lord!</i>

289
00:23:26,172 --> 00:23:30,408
<i>( Robin whimpering,</i>
<i>gasping )</i>

290
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:36,080
Some boys develop
more slowly.

291
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:38,082
He's still young.

292
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:41,018
He's 13.
Boys go to war at 13.

293
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,454
- He has other gifts.
- Does he?

294
00:23:43,456 --> 00:23:45,956
The gift
of a great name.

295
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:50,060
Sometimes that's all
one needs.

296
00:23:50,062 --> 00:23:53,464
( Robin whimpering )

297
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:57,134
Good-bye, Lord Royce,
and thank you for all
you've done for me.

298
00:23:57,136 --> 00:23:59,870
I have done nothing more
than my duty, my lady.

299
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:01,572
I have no doubt
that on my return,

300
00:24:01,574 --> 00:24:04,475
Robin's skills will have
improved immeasurably.

301
00:24:04,477 --> 00:24:06,644
He'll be safe here.

302
00:24:06,646 --> 00:24:09,580
<i>As for his skills,</i>

303
00:24:09,582 --> 00:24:12,583
I make no promises.

304
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:16,854
<i>( birds screeching )</i>

305
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:27,131
Will we head north
at some point?

306
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:30,835
He said
Sansa had a brother
at Castle Black.

307
00:24:30,837 --> 00:24:33,704
We're a few days' ride
from the Kingsroad.

308
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:36,874
- But that will take us--
- Us?

309
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:40,044
The only reason you're here
is because Jaime Lannister

310
00:24:40,046 --> 00:24:42,847
told me you weren't
safe in the capital.

311
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:47,017
You're hundreds of miles
from King's Landing.

312
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:49,086
No one knows
what you look like.

313
00:24:49,088 --> 00:24:51,555
No one cares.
You're safe.

314
00:24:51,557 --> 00:24:55,893
- But I'm your squire.
- Do you even know
what a squire is?

315
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:58,762
An attendant
to a knight.

316
00:24:58,764 --> 00:25:00,097
I'm not a knight.

317
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:02,500
That means
you're not a squire.

318
00:25:02,502 --> 00:25:03,634
Well, where would I go?

319
00:25:03,636 --> 00:25:07,238
I don't care.
I'm not your mother.

320
00:25:14,947 --> 00:25:16,714
You swore to find
the Stark girls.

321
00:25:16,716 --> 00:25:19,583
I found Arya.
She didn't want
my protection.

322
00:25:19,585 --> 00:25:22,953
-<i> Sansa still might.</i>
- Will you shut your mouth?

323
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:26,090
I didn't ask
for your advice.

324
00:25:26,926 --> 00:25:30,094
I don't want anyone
following me.

325
00:25:30,096 --> 00:25:31,095
I'm not a leader.

326
00:25:31,097 --> 00:25:33,998
All I ever wanted
was to fight for a lord
I believed in.

327
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,702
The good lords are dead
and the rest are monsters.

328
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:43,240
-<i> ( horse whinnies )</i>
-<i> ( hoofbeats approaching )</i>

329
00:25:43,242 --> 00:25:47,845
( horses neighing )

330
00:25:47,847 --> 00:25:51,282
You told Lord Royce
we were going to the Fingers.

331
00:25:51,284 --> 00:25:52,883
I did.

332
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:55,753
- But we're heading west.
- We are.

333
00:25:55,755 --> 00:25:58,989
If he wanted to betray us,
he already would have.

334
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:03,127
Lord Royce
might be as honorable
as he thinks he is,

335
00:26:03,129 --> 00:26:05,296
but he's not alone
in that castle.

336
00:26:05,298 --> 00:26:07,665
Do you trust all those
knights and ladies,

337
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:09,099
<i>stable boys</i>
<i>and serving girls?</i>

338
00:26:09,101 --> 00:26:13,304
No, do you trust
the carriage driver
or the knights escorting us?

339
00:26:13,306 --> 00:26:15,706
No.
( chuckles )

340
00:26:15,708 --> 00:26:16,740
But I pay them well

341
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:19,843
and they've seen what happens
to men who disappoint me.

342
00:26:19,845 --> 00:26:21,812
So where are we going?

343
00:26:21,814 --> 00:26:24,114
To a land where
you trust everyone?

344
00:26:24,116 --> 00:26:26,584
To a land
so far from here,

345
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:30,754
even Cersei Lannister
can't get her hands on you.

346
00:26:37,063 --> 00:26:41,832
It was such a deep,
deep shock to us all.

347
00:26:44,637 --> 00:26:46,604
Your father was a--

348
00:26:46,606 --> 00:26:49,106
a force to be
reckoned with.

349
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:50,874
He truly was.

350
00:26:50,876 --> 00:26:52,910
I wouldn't
presume to claim

351
00:26:52,912 --> 00:26:54,278
to have known him
as such, but--

352
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:58,248
<i>but just being</i>
<i>in his presence was enough</i>
<i>to make it so clear</i>

353
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:01,318
just how formidable
a person you were
dealing with.

354
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:05,789
What a-- what a force
to be reckoned with.

355
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:06,624
( sighs )

356
00:27:06,626 --> 00:27:10,127
Thank you so much
for your kind words.

357
00:27:13,933 --> 00:27:16,100
Deepest condolences,
Your Grace.

358
00:27:16,102 --> 00:27:19,703
This tragedy...
I never trusted Varys.

359
00:27:19,705 --> 00:27:22,373
I often warned...

360
00:27:25,411 --> 00:27:27,177
Your Grace.

361
00:27:29,215 --> 00:27:31,815
Cousin Lancel.
I hardly recognized you.

362
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:33,851
My deepest
sympathies.

363
00:27:33,853 --> 00:27:37,121
I apologize
for my son's
appearance.

364
00:27:37,123 --> 00:27:39,790
Uncle, it's quite
all right.

365
00:27:41,394 --> 00:27:43,927
They call themselves
sparrows.

366
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:46,163
( chuckles )
Bloody fanatics.

367
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:48,399
Religion has its place,
of course,

368
00:27:48,401 --> 00:27:50,267
but at a certain point...

369
00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:54,071
They never would
have come to the capital
when Tywin was alive.

370
00:27:54,073 --> 00:27:56,306
I'm sure he'll
grow out of it,

371
00:27:56,308 --> 00:27:58,108
whatever it is.

372
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:01,245
- Excuse me.
- Of course.

373
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:21,098
Your wounds
from the Blackwater
seem to have healed.

374
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:25,869
It wasn't my wounds
that needed healing.

375
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:30,374
What can I do
for you?

376
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:32,142
You can forgive me.

377
00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:35,345
What could you possibly
have done to warrant
my forgiveness?

378
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:37,981
I led you
into the darkness.

379
00:28:37,983 --> 00:28:40,784
I doubt you've ever
led anyone anywhere.

380
00:28:40,786 --> 00:28:43,821
I tempted you
into our...

381
00:28:43,823 --> 00:28:47,091
unnatural relations.

382
00:28:47,093 --> 00:28:51,795
And, of course,
there was the king...

383
00:28:52,832 --> 00:28:55,132
his boar hunt.

384
00:28:56,736 --> 00:28:59,002
His wine.

385
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:03,507
I don't know what
you're talking about.

386
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:07,044
I'm a different
person now.

387
00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:11,014
I've found peace
in the light of the Seven.

388
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:12,182
<i>You can, too.</i>

389
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:14,051
<i>They watch over</i>
<i>all of us,</i>

390
00:29:14,053 --> 00:29:16,920
ready to dole out mercy

391
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:18,789
or justice.

392
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:24,361
Their world
is at hand.

393
00:29:26,165 --> 00:29:28,398
I will pray for
your father's soul.

394
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,067
( laughs )

395
00:29:30,069 --> 00:29:35,038
The day Tywin Lannister's
soul needs your help...

396
00:29:42,047 --> 00:29:45,549
- Olyvar: It looks like Dorne.
- Loras: It doesn't.

397
00:29:45,551 --> 00:29:48,018
( laughs )
It does.

398
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:53,290
That's the--
that's the Sunspear
bit right there.

399
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:56,527
And that's where
the mountains are.

400
00:29:56,529 --> 00:29:59,296
And over here is--

401
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:02,132
is Sunsnake?

402
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:03,400
Stonespear?

403
00:30:03,402 --> 00:30:05,402
Sandstone.

404
00:30:05,404 --> 00:30:06,837
Yes.

405
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:09,273
Yes, Sandstone.

406
00:30:09,275 --> 00:30:10,507
( kisses )

407
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:12,142
Just there.

408
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:14,278
Fine.

409
00:30:16,448 --> 00:30:18,582
It's Dorne.

410
00:30:19,285 --> 00:30:21,084
We should go there.

411
00:30:21,086 --> 00:30:24,588
I think we would
have a lovely time,

412
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,557
judging by
my experience.

413
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:31,228
That would be wonderful.
Dorne, Highgarden.

414
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:33,230
Anywhere but here.

415
00:30:41,407 --> 00:30:44,274
We're late for dinner
as it is.

416
00:30:44,577 --> 00:30:46,243
You're very respectful.

417
00:30:46,245 --> 00:30:48,512
I'm very hungry.

418
00:31:04,897 --> 00:31:07,364
What's your name?

419
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:09,132
Olyvar, my lady.

420
00:31:09,134 --> 00:31:10,434
I'm afraid my brother

421
00:31:10,436 --> 00:31:15,072
is keeping the king
waiting, Olyvar.

422
00:31:23,449 --> 00:31:25,916
My lady.

423
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:42,599
Perhaps you might
consider being a bit
more discreet?

424
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:43,934
Why?

425
00:31:43,936 --> 00:31:45,636
They all know
about me anyway.

426
00:31:45,638 --> 00:31:48,338
Everybody
knows everything
about everyone.

427
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,941
What's the point
in trying to keep a secret
in a place like this?

428
00:31:50,943 --> 00:31:55,946
In any event, you shouldn't
keep your intended waiting.

429
00:31:56,548 --> 00:31:58,515
My intended?
Please.

430
00:31:58,517 --> 00:31:59,516
<i>Tywin's dead.</i>

431
00:31:59,518 --> 00:32:02,119
<i>That means no one</i>
<i>can force Cersei</i>
<i>to marry me.</i>

432
00:32:02,121 --> 00:32:03,921
- Lucky you.
- Unlucky you.

433
00:32:03,923 --> 00:32:05,589
You think I want
that woman married
to my brother?

434
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:09,626
If she doesn't marry me,
she doesn't go to Highgarden.

435
00:32:09,628 --> 00:32:11,295
Which means she stays
in King's Landing.

436
00:32:11,297 --> 00:32:16,633
<i>Which means you're trapped</i>
<i>here with Cersei Lannister</i>
<i>as your mother by law.</i>

437
00:32:16,635 --> 00:32:18,669
Perhaps.

438
00:32:19,505 --> 00:32:21,505
Perhaps?

439
00:32:21,507 --> 00:32:24,041
Perhaps.

440
00:32:24,043 --> 00:32:27,711
<i>( birds screeching )</i>

441
00:32:36,255 --> 00:32:38,622
Eunuch,
the Spider,

442
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:40,590
the Master
of Whisperers.

443
00:32:40,592 --> 00:32:43,527
Imp, Half-man.

444
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:47,464
There are faster ways
to kill yourself.

445
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:49,099
Not for a coward.

446
00:32:49,101 --> 00:32:51,168
You are many things,
my friend,

447
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:54,004
but not a coward.

448
00:32:56,542 --> 00:32:59,376
You never told me
why you set me free.

449
00:32:59,378 --> 00:33:02,412
Your brother
asked me to.

450
00:33:02,414 --> 00:33:03,613
Could have said no.

451
00:33:03,615 --> 00:33:06,350
Refuse the Kingslayer?
A dangerous proposition.

452
00:33:06,352 --> 00:33:08,352
Not as dangerous
as releasing me.

453
00:33:08,354 --> 00:33:11,121
You risked your life,
your position, everything.

454
00:33:11,123 --> 00:33:14,291
Why? You're not family.
You owe me nothing.

455
00:33:14,293 --> 00:33:16,626
I didn't do it for you.

456
00:33:16,628 --> 00:33:18,095
I did it for
the Seven Kingdoms.

457
00:33:18,097 --> 00:33:22,199
A drunken dwarf
will never be the savior
of the Seven Kingdoms.

458
00:33:22,201 --> 00:33:23,433
I don't believe
in saviors.

459
00:33:23,435 --> 00:33:28,739
I believe men of talent
have a part to play
in the war to come.

460
00:33:28,741 --> 00:33:31,408
You're going to have
to find another soldier.

461
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:35,145
I'm done with Westeros
and Westeros is done
with me.

462
00:33:35,147 --> 00:33:38,415
You have many
admirable qualities,

463
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:40,050
self-pity is not
one of them.

464
00:33:40,052 --> 00:33:42,085
Any fool
with a bit of luck

465
00:33:42,087 --> 00:33:45,255
can find himself
born into power.

466
00:33:45,257 --> 00:33:49,359
But earning it for yourself,
that takes work.

467
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:52,229
I'm not well-suited
for work.

468
00:33:52,231 --> 00:33:53,130
I think you are.

469
00:33:53,132 --> 00:33:55,799
You have your father's
instincts for politics.

470
00:33:55,801 --> 00:33:57,367
And you have compassion.

471
00:33:57,369 --> 00:34:00,170
Compassion? Yes.

472
00:34:00,172 --> 00:34:03,673
I killed my lover
with my bare hands.

473
00:34:03,675 --> 00:34:06,710
I shot my own father
with a crossbow.

474
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:08,779
I never said
you were perfect.

475
00:34:08,781 --> 00:34:13,383
What is it
you want exactly?

476
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:15,352
Peace.

477
00:34:15,354 --> 00:34:16,319
Prosperity.

478
00:34:16,321 --> 00:34:19,790
A land where the powerful
do not prey on the powerless.

479
00:34:19,792 --> 00:34:22,259
Where the castles
are made of gingerbread

480
00:34:22,261 --> 00:34:24,761
and the moats are filled
with blackberry wine.

481
00:34:24,763 --> 00:34:27,164
The powerful have always
preyed on the powerless.

482
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:30,500
That's how
they became powerful
in the first place.

483
00:34:30,502 --> 00:34:31,601
Perhaps.

484
00:34:31,603 --> 00:34:35,338
And perhaps we've grown
so used to horror,

485
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:38,375
we assume
there's no other way.

486
00:34:38,377 --> 00:34:40,377
<i>If you sat</i>
<i>on the Iron Throne,</i>

487
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:42,712
<i>would you spread misery</i>
<i>throughout the land?</i>

488
00:34:42,714 --> 00:34:46,116
I will never sit
on the Iron Throne.

489
00:34:46,118 --> 00:34:47,350
<i>No, you won't.</i>

490
00:34:47,352 --> 00:34:50,487
<i>But you could help another</i>
<i>climb those steps</i>

491
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:52,255
and take that seat.

492
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:55,859
The Seven Kingdoms
need someone stronger
than Tommen,

493
00:34:55,861 --> 00:34:57,227
but gentler
than Stannis.

494
00:34:57,229 --> 00:35:01,465
A monarch who can
intimidate the high lords
and inspire the people.

495
00:35:01,467 --> 00:35:05,235
A ruler loved by millions
with a powerful army

496
00:35:05,237 --> 00:35:07,204
and the right family name.

497
00:35:07,206 --> 00:35:09,239
Good luck finding him.

498
00:35:09,241 --> 00:35:13,276
Who said anything
about "him"?

499
00:35:15,647 --> 00:35:18,315
You have a choice,
my friend.

500
00:35:18,317 --> 00:35:20,851
You can stay here
at Illyrio's palace

501
00:35:20,853 --> 00:35:23,120
and drink yourself
to death,

502
00:35:23,122 --> 00:35:25,489
or you can ride with me
to Meereen,

503
00:35:25,491 --> 00:35:26,590
meet Daenerys Targaryen,

504
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:30,293
and decide if the world
is worth fighting for.

505
00:35:31,497 --> 00:35:36,466
Can I drink myself to death
on the road to Meereen?

506
00:35:40,772 --> 00:35:44,808
-<i> ( chatter )</i>
-<i> ( goat bleating )</i>

507
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:48,378
When did the Unsullied
start patrolling the streets
of Meereen?

508
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:52,782
Looks like
your friends haven't
been behaving themselves.

509
00:35:54,453 --> 00:35:57,521
Our mission to Yunkai
was a resounding success.

510
00:35:57,523 --> 00:36:00,357
The Wise Masters of Yunkai
have agreed to cede power

511
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:02,225
to a council of elders
made up of both

512
00:36:02,227 --> 00:36:04,161
the freed men
and the former
slaveholders.

513
00:36:04,163 --> 00:36:08,431
All matters
of consequence will be
brought to you for review.

514
00:36:08,433 --> 00:36:09,599
Good.

515
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:11,801
They did ask
for some concessions.

516
00:36:11,803 --> 00:36:13,503
Concessions?

517
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:15,939
Politics is the art
of compromise, Your Grace.

518
00:36:15,941 --> 00:36:18,675
I'm not a politician.
I'm a queen.

519
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:21,645
Hizdahr:<i> Forgive me.</i>
<i>You're right, of course.</i>

520
00:36:21,647 --> 00:36:25,749
Still, it's easier
to rule happy subjects
than angry ones.

521
00:36:25,751 --> 00:36:28,652
I don't expect
the Wise Masters
to be happy.

522
00:36:28,654 --> 00:36:31,688
Slavery made them rich.
I ended slavery.

523
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:34,524
They do not ask
for the return
of slavery.

524
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:39,196
They ask for the reopening
of the fighting pits.

525
00:36:39,198 --> 00:36:40,230
The fighting pits?

526
00:36:40,232 --> 00:36:42,566
Where slaves fought
slaves to the death?

527
00:36:42,568 --> 00:36:44,768
In the new world
that you've brought to us,

528
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:47,971
free men would fight
free men.

529
00:36:48,507 --> 00:36:49,973
<i>The pit fighters</i>
<i>you liberated</i>

530
00:36:49,975 --> 00:36:51,908
<i>plead for</i>
<i>this opportunity.</i>

531
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:54,778
Bring some here
and ask them yourself.

532
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,612
No fighting pits.

533
00:36:55,614 --> 00:36:57,514
Opening them would show
the people of Yunkai

534
00:36:57,516 --> 00:36:59,449
and Meereen that you
respect their traditions.

535
00:36:59,451 --> 00:37:02,385
I do not respect
the tradition of
human cockfighting.

536
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:07,457
- If you--
- How many times must I say no
before you understand?

537
00:37:08,493 --> 00:37:10,727
Whatever he wants from me,
he's not going to get it.

538
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:13,697
If he really believes
I'm going to reopen
the fighting pits...

539
00:37:13,699 --> 00:37:17,667
You should reopen
the fighting pits.

540
00:37:17,669 --> 00:37:18,802
What?

541
00:37:18,804 --> 00:37:22,539
My mother was a whore.
I told you that.

542
00:37:23,609 --> 00:37:25,675
She liked to drink
pear brandy.

543
00:37:25,677 --> 00:37:29,379
The older she got,
the less she made
selling her body,

544
00:37:29,381 --> 00:37:31,414
the more she wanted
to drink.

545
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:34,951
So one day when I was 12,
she sold me to a slaver

546
00:37:34,953 --> 00:37:38,388
she fucked
the night before.

547
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:40,023
I'm sorry.

548
00:37:40,025 --> 00:37:42,759
Why?
I was a bad child.

549
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:46,696
I wasn't big,
but I was quick.

550
00:37:46,698 --> 00:37:47,764
And I loved to fight.

551
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:49,766
So they sold me
to a man in Tolos

552
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:51,868
who trained fighters
for the pits.

553
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:54,804
I had my first match
when I was 16.

554
00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:55,905
You were sold
into slavery,

555
00:37:55,907 --> 00:37:58,908
forced to fight to the death
for the amusement
of the masters,

556
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:01,444
and you're defending
the fighting pits?

557
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:02,279
( laughs )

558
00:38:02,281 --> 00:38:04,881
I'm only here
because of those pits.

559
00:38:04,883 --> 00:38:07,584
I learned to fight
like a Dothraki screamer,

560
00:38:07,586 --> 00:38:10,553
a Norvoshi priest,
a Westerosi knight.

561
00:38:10,555 --> 00:38:11,755
Soon I was famous.

562
00:38:11,757 --> 00:38:14,024
10,000 men and women
screamed my name

563
00:38:14,026 --> 00:38:15,692
when I stepped
into the pit.

564
00:38:15,694 --> 00:38:17,794
I made so much money
for my master,

565
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:20,597
he set me free
when he died.

566
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:22,599
I joined the Second Sons.

567
00:38:22,601 --> 00:38:25,068
And then I met you.

568
00:38:30,042 --> 00:38:31,641
You're the queen.

569
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:34,978
Everyone's too afraid
of you to speak truth.

570
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,713
Everyone but me.

571
00:38:36,715 --> 00:38:41,518
You've made thousands
of enemies all across
the world.

572
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,554
As soon
as they see weakness,

573
00:38:44,556 --> 00:38:46,423
they'll attack.

574
00:38:46,425 --> 00:38:49,392
Show your strength
here, now.

575
00:38:49,394 --> 00:38:52,729
That's why
I have the Unsullied
patrolling the streets.

576
00:38:52,731 --> 00:38:53,630
( scoffs )

577
00:38:53,632 --> 00:38:57,801
Anyone with a chest
full of gold can buy
an army of Unsullied.

578
00:38:57,803 --> 00:39:01,838
You're not
the Mother of Unsullied.

579
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,474
You're the Mother
of Dragons.

580
00:39:09,948 --> 00:39:14,818
I don't want
another child's bones
dropped at my feet.

581
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:17,554
No one's seen
Drogon in weeks.

582
00:39:17,556 --> 00:39:22,092
For all I know,
he's flown halfway
across the world.

583
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:28,965
I can't control
them anymore.

584
00:39:28,967 --> 00:39:33,436
A dragon queen
with no dragons

585
00:39:33,438 --> 00:39:35,839
is not a queen.

586
00:40:41,072 --> 00:40:43,673
Viserion?

587
00:40:45,544 --> 00:40:47,577
Rhaegal?

588
00:40:55,053 --> 00:40:57,921
( snarling )

589
00:40:58,857 --> 00:41:00,623
Easy. Easy.

590
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,926
Easy.

591
00:41:02,928 --> 00:41:04,928
( roaring )

592
00:41:13,071 --> 00:41:16,606
<i>( roaring continues )</i>

593
00:41:31,089 --> 00:41:32,989
<i>( door opens )</i>

594
00:41:42,234 --> 00:41:44,667
So here we are.

595
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:46,970
Here we are.

596
00:41:47,272 --> 00:41:51,641
When we first met,
you were my prisoner.

597
00:41:51,643 --> 00:41:55,812
And now,
for our last meeting...

598
00:41:56,882 --> 00:41:59,883
This doesn't have to be
our last meeting.

599
00:41:59,885 --> 00:42:02,986
No, but it will be.

600
00:42:04,556 --> 00:42:06,823
You know
what Stannis wants?

601
00:42:06,825 --> 00:42:08,858
He wants me
to bend the knee.

602
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:13,029
And he wants
the free folk
to fight for him.

603
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:15,131
I'll give him
this much,

604
00:42:15,133 --> 00:42:16,232
he's bold.

605
00:42:16,234 --> 00:42:18,635
Shouldn't a king
be bold?

606
00:42:18,637 --> 00:42:20,236
<i>Oh, aye.</i>

607
00:42:20,238 --> 00:42:23,006
I respect him.

608
00:42:23,008 --> 00:42:24,173
If he gets what he wants,

609
00:42:24,175 --> 00:42:26,576
I expect he'll be
a better ruler
than the fools

610
00:42:26,578 --> 00:42:30,213
sitting on the Iron Throne
the last hundred years.

611
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:33,316
But I'll never serve him.

612
00:42:33,852 --> 00:42:35,318
You told me you weren't
here to conquer.

613
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,320
You told me your people
have bled enough.

614
00:42:37,322 --> 00:42:38,621
That's right.

615
00:42:38,623 --> 00:42:41,057
I don't want
them bleeding for
Stannis Baratheon either.

616
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:45,261
You spent your life
convincing 90 clans
to come together

617
00:42:45,263 --> 00:42:47,730
for the first time
in history.

618
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:49,332
Thenns and Hornfoots,

619
00:42:49,334 --> 00:42:52,101
the ice-river clans,
even the giants.

620
00:42:52,103 --> 00:42:56,806
A life's work uniting them.
You didn't do it for power.

621
00:42:56,808 --> 00:42:58,975
You didn't do it
for glory.

622
00:42:58,977 --> 00:43:00,877
You brought them
together to save them

623
00:43:00,879 --> 00:43:02,745
<i>because none of them</i>
<i>will survive the winter,</i>

624
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:04,147
<i>not if they're north</i>
<i>of the Wall.</i>

625
00:43:04,149 --> 00:43:07,216
Isn't their survival
more important than
your pride?

626
00:43:07,218 --> 00:43:09,352
Pride?

627
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:14,123
Fuck my pride.

628
00:43:15,594 --> 00:43:18,795
This isn't about that.

629
00:43:18,797 --> 00:43:23,700
Then bend the knee
and save your people.

630
00:43:24,302 --> 00:43:27,837
They followed me
because they respected me.

631
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:29,138
Because they
believed in me.

632
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:31,874
The moment I kneel
for a southern king,
that's all gone.

633
00:43:31,876 --> 00:43:35,278
And how many
tens of thousands
are out there right now?

634
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,214
How many women?
How many children?

635
00:43:38,216 --> 00:43:41,985
And you won't
go out and rescue
them because why?

636
00:43:41,987 --> 00:43:44,654
You're afraid
of looking afraid.

637
00:43:44,656 --> 00:43:48,191
Oh, I am afraid.

638
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,827
No shame in that.

639
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:03,740
How will they do it?
Beheading?

640
00:44:03,742 --> 00:44:05,775
Hanging?

641
00:44:08,747 --> 00:44:11,047
They'll burn you alive.

642
00:44:15,186 --> 00:44:17,754
Bad way to go.

643
00:44:20,959 --> 00:44:22,959
I'll be honest with you.

644
00:44:22,961 --> 00:44:25,028
I don't want to die.

645
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:26,162
And burnt to death,

646
00:44:26,164 --> 00:44:28,998
I don't want people
to remember me like that,

647
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,668
scorched and screaming.

648
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:33,770
But it's better
than betraying

649
00:44:33,772 --> 00:44:35,071
everything I believe.

650
00:44:35,073 --> 00:44:37,273
And what happens
to your people?

651
00:44:37,275 --> 00:44:41,210
You preserve your dignity
and die standing

652
00:44:41,212 --> 00:44:43,846
and they'll sing
songs about you.

653
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:46,349
You'd rather burn
than kneel.

654
00:44:46,351 --> 00:44:48,418
The great hero.

655
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:52,455
Until winter comes
and the white walkers
come for us all

656
00:44:52,457 --> 00:44:56,092
and there's no one
left to sing.

657
00:44:58,096 --> 00:45:00,430
You're a good lad.

658
00:45:00,432 --> 00:45:02,365
Truly you are.

659
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:07,904
But if you can't
understand why I won't
enlist my people

660
00:45:07,906 --> 00:45:10,273
in a foreigner's war,

661
00:45:10,275 --> 00:45:13,843
there's no point
explaining.

662
00:45:20,885 --> 00:45:22,952
<i>( pounds on door )</i>

663
00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:31,260
I think you're making
a terrible mistake.

664
00:45:31,262 --> 00:45:32,328
( chuckles )

665
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:35,164
The freedom to make
my own mistakes

666
00:45:35,166 --> 00:45:37,834
was all I ever wanted.

667
00:45:47,445 --> 00:45:49,946
<i>( door closes )</i>

668
00:45:49,948 --> 00:45:51,848
<i>( latch clanks )</i>

669
00:46:45,837 --> 00:46:50,206
Mance Rayder,
you've been called
the King-beyond-the-Wall.

670
00:46:50,208 --> 00:46:53,009
Westeros
only has one king.

671
00:46:53,011 --> 00:46:56,212
Bend the knee,
I promise you mercy.

672
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,961
Kneel and live.

673
00:47:18,303 --> 00:47:23,105
This was my home
for many years.

674
00:47:24,242 --> 00:47:26,576
I wish you good fortune

675
00:47:26,578 --> 00:47:29,111
in the wars to come.

676
00:48:10,588 --> 00:48:12,388
We all must choose.

677
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:16,893
Man or woman,
young or old,

678
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:20,196
lord or peasant,
our choices are the same.

679
00:48:20,198 --> 00:48:23,900
We choose light
or we choose darkness.

680
00:48:23,902 --> 00:48:26,969
<i>We choose good</i>
<i>or we choose evil.</i>

681
00:48:26,971 --> 00:48:32,642
We choose the true god
or the false.

682
00:48:43,321 --> 00:48:44,520
Free folk,

683
00:48:44,522 --> 00:48:47,156
<i>there is only</i>
<i>one true king</i>

684
00:48:47,158 --> 00:48:50,159
<i>and his name</i>
<i>is Stannis.</i>

685
00:48:50,161 --> 00:48:52,228
Here stands
your king of lies.

686
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:56,532
Behold the fate of those
who choose the darkness.

687
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:51,721
