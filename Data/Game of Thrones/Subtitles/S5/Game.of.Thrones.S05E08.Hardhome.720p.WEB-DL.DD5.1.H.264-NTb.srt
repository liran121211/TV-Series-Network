1
00:02:05,528 --> 00:02:07,712
Your Grace,
I want to say--

2
00:02:07,832 --> 00:02:09,412
You will not speak.

3
00:02:11,868 --> 00:02:13,869
How do I know you are
who you say you are?

4
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,399
If only I were otherwise.

5
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,279
If you are Tyrion Lannister,
why shouldn't I kill you

6
00:02:19,313 --> 00:02:21,614
to pay your family back
for what it did to mine?

7
00:02:21,649 --> 00:02:24,317
You want revenge
against the Lannisters?

8
00:02:24,401 --> 00:02:26,736
I killed my mother
Joanna Lannister

9
00:02:26,738 --> 00:02:28,571
on the day I was born.

10
00:02:28,622 --> 00:02:32,158
I killed my father Tywin Lannister
with a bolt to the heart.

11
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:34,827
I am the greatest Lannister
killer of our time.

12
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:37,013
So I should welcome you
into my service

13
00:02:37,047 --> 00:02:39,282
because you murdered members
of your own family?

14
00:02:40,517 --> 00:02:43,036
Into your service?

15
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:46,022
Your Grace, we have
only just met.

16
00:02:46,056 --> 00:02:48,374
It's too soon to know
if you deserve my service.

17
00:02:48,442 --> 00:02:51,260
If you'd rather return
to the fighting pits,

18
00:02:51,295 --> 00:02:53,513
just say the word.

19
00:02:55,649 --> 00:02:58,184
When I was a young man,
I heard a story

20
00:02:58,235 --> 00:03:01,688
about a baby born during the
worst storm in living memory.

21
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:03,740
She had no wealth,
no lands, no army,

22
00:03:03,774 --> 00:03:07,160
<i>only a name and a
handful of supporters,</i>

23
00:03:07,194 --> 00:03:10,697
most of whom probably thought they could
use that name to benefit themselves.

24
00:03:10,748 --> 00:03:13,282
They kept her alive, moving
her from place to place,

25
00:03:13,334 --> 00:03:16,519
<i>often hours ahead of the men
who'd been sent to kill her.</i>

26
00:03:16,553 --> 00:03:19,839
<i>She was eventually sold off to some
warlord on the edge of the world</i>

27
00:03:19,923 --> 00:03:22,125
<i>and that appeared to be that.</i>

28
00:03:22,127 --> 00:03:24,127
<i>And then a few years later,</i>

29
00:03:24,178 --> 00:03:26,462
the most well-informed
person I knew

30
00:03:26,547 --> 00:03:29,382
told me that this girl without
wealth, lands, or armies

31
00:03:29,433 --> 00:03:32,635
had somehow acquired all three
in a very short span of time,

32
00:03:32,637 --> 00:03:34,637
along with three dragons.

33
00:03:34,688 --> 00:03:36,723
<i>He thought she was our best,</i>

34
00:03:36,774 --> 00:03:39,642
<i>last chance to build
a better world.</i>

35
00:03:41,111 --> 00:03:43,813
I thought you were worth
meeting at the very least.

36
00:03:43,847 --> 00:03:45,314
And why are you worth meeting?

37
00:03:45,316 --> 00:03:47,150
Why should I spend
my time listening to you?

38
00:03:47,152 --> 00:03:50,269
Because you cannot build
a better world on your own.

39
00:03:50,304 --> 00:03:53,723
You have no one at your side who
understands the land you want to rule.

40
00:03:53,757 --> 00:03:55,742
The strengths and
weaknesses of the houses

41
00:03:55,793 --> 00:03:57,076
<i>that will either
join or oppose you.</i>

42
00:03:57,127 --> 00:04:00,129
I will have a very large army

43
00:04:00,164 --> 00:04:01,714
and very large dragons.

44
00:04:01,749 --> 00:04:05,334
Killing and politics
aren't always the same thing.

45
00:04:05,336 --> 00:04:07,303
When I served
as Hand of the King,

46
00:04:07,337 --> 00:04:09,972
I did quite well with the latter
considering the king in question

47
00:04:10,007 --> 00:04:12,308
preferred torturing animals
to leading his people.

48
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,395
I could do an even better job

49
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:17,714
advising a ruler worth the name.

50
00:04:17,748 --> 00:04:20,116
<i>If that is indeed what you are.</i>

51
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:22,402
So you want to advise me?

52
00:04:24,521 --> 00:04:26,656
Very well.

53
00:04:28,025 --> 00:04:29,575
What would you
have me do with him?

54
00:04:31,328 --> 00:04:35,031
<i>I swore I would kill him
if he ever returned.</i>

55
00:04:35,033 --> 00:04:36,949
I know.

56
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:44,340
Why should the people trust a queen
who can't keep her promises?

57
00:04:47,411 --> 00:04:50,129
Whomever Ser Jorah was when
he started informing on you,

58
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:53,216
he is no longer that man.

59
00:04:53,267 --> 00:04:55,301
I can't remember
ever seeing a sane man

60
00:04:55,385 --> 00:04:57,720
as devoted to anything
as he is to serving you.

61
00:04:57,722 --> 00:05:00,807
<i>He claims he would kill
for you and die for you</i>

62
00:05:00,858 --> 00:05:03,559
<i>and nothing I ever witnessed
gives me reason to doubt him.</i>

63
00:05:07,498 --> 00:05:09,632
And yet he did betray you.

64
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:24,747
Did he have an opportunity
to confess his betrayal?

65
00:05:24,749 --> 00:05:26,999
Yes.

66
00:05:27,034 --> 00:05:29,085
Many opportunities.

67
00:05:29,153 --> 00:05:31,754
<i>And did he?</i>

68
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:36,142
No, not until forced to do so.

69
00:05:40,864 --> 00:05:42,765
He worships you.

70
00:05:42,816 --> 00:05:45,601
He is in love with you, I think.

71
00:05:45,652 --> 00:05:47,937
<i>But he did not trust you
with the truth.</i>

72
00:05:47,988 --> 00:05:49,489
<i>An unpleasant truth to be sure,</i>

73
00:05:49,573 --> 00:05:52,008
<i>but one of great
significance to you.</i>

74
00:05:52,042 --> 00:05:55,178
<i>He did not trust that you would
be wise enough to forgive him.</i>

75
00:05:56,313 --> 00:05:58,214
So I should kill him?

76
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,584
A ruler who kills
those devoted to her

77
00:06:01,618 --> 00:06:04,287
is not a ruler
who inspires devotion.

78
00:06:04,338 --> 00:06:06,506
And you're going to need
to inspire devotion,

79
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:10,376
a lot of it, if you're ever going
to rule across the Narrow Sea.

80
00:06:12,012 --> 00:06:15,298
But you cannot have him
by your side when you do.

81
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,972
Remove Ser Jorah from the city.

82
00:07:34,044 --> 00:07:35,761
Confess.

83
00:07:35,796 --> 00:07:38,047
My son.

84
00:07:39,683 --> 00:07:42,118
Let me speak to--

85
00:07:42,152 --> 00:07:43,386
Confess.

86
00:07:43,437 --> 00:07:45,354
I meant it.

87
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:49,141
My face will be the
last thing you see--

88
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:09,178
My name is Lanna.
I'm an orphan.

89
00:08:10,747 --> 00:08:12,715
<i>When I was eight,
I begged enough money</i>

90
00:08:12,749 --> 00:08:14,750
<i>to buy my first
bucket of oysters.</i>

91
00:08:14,752 --> 00:08:19,088
I sold that bucket and made
enough money to buy two more.

92
00:08:21,058 --> 00:08:24,560
<i>It took a while, but
I finally saved enough</i>

93
00:08:24,594 --> 00:08:26,679
<i>to buy myself an oyster cart.</i>

94
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,514
<i>Now every morning,</i>

95
00:08:28,565 --> 00:08:30,650
<i>I make my way
down to the canals.</i>

96
00:08:32,686 --> 00:08:35,938
<i>I pass the fish mongers
and the bakers.</i>

97
00:08:40,994 --> 00:08:42,662
<i>I usually see Lhara,</i>

98
00:08:42,696 --> 00:08:45,748
<i>my first customer of the day
on her way home.</i>

99
00:08:47,167 --> 00:08:50,536
<i>Then I turn left
onto Moonsinger Lane--</i>

100
00:08:53,006 --> 00:08:56,125
Turn left onto Ragman Lane

101
00:08:56,176 --> 00:08:57,677
where I do most of my trade.

102
00:08:57,711 --> 00:08:59,962
Lanna is very impressive.

103
00:08:59,964 --> 00:09:02,631
Very industrious.

104
00:09:02,683 --> 00:09:05,384
She will make a fine servant
for the Many-Faced God.

105
00:09:05,435 --> 00:09:07,436
How will she serve him?

106
00:09:07,471 --> 00:09:10,890
She will no longer
turn left onto Ragman Lane.

107
00:09:10,941 --> 00:09:13,309
She will turn right
and go to Ragman Harbor.

108
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,944
What will she do there?

109
00:09:14,978 --> 00:09:16,979
She will see.

110
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,949
<i>See what?</i>

111
00:09:19,983 --> 00:09:22,485
<i>How can a man tell a girl this?</i>

112
00:09:22,569 --> 00:09:23,819
<i>If he knew what she would see,</i>

113
00:09:23,821 --> 00:09:26,322
<i>there would be
no reason to send her.</i>

114
00:09:26,324 --> 00:09:28,991
Oysters, clams, and cockles!

115
00:09:46,176 --> 00:09:49,261
Oysters, clams, and cockles!

116
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,689
Oysters, clams, and cockles!

117
00:10:00,691 --> 00:10:03,776
Your oysters fresh?

118
00:10:03,827 --> 00:10:05,444
Best in the city.

119
00:10:05,495 --> 00:10:07,580
You wouldn't lie
to an old man, would you?

120
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,545
Mm.

121
00:10:22,547 --> 00:10:26,382
Very nice. Give me
four with vinegar.

122
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,687
It's my 18th voyage.

123
00:10:31,721 --> 00:10:34,273
Returned from all of them
without a scratch on me.

124
00:10:40,947 --> 00:10:42,398
Can't do it.

125
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,401
<i>Please, I've three children.</i>

126
00:10:45,452 --> 00:10:47,153
<i>Without me...</i>

127
00:10:47,204 --> 00:10:48,704
Here, take it.
You have to.

128
00:10:48,738 --> 00:10:50,489
I've three children.

129
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,740
- What will they do?
- Come on.

130
00:10:51,792 --> 00:10:53,542
They've nothing without me.

131
00:10:53,577 --> 00:10:55,077
<i>Please, you have to!</i>

132
00:10:55,128 --> 00:10:57,580
Please, you don't understand!

133
00:10:57,582 --> 00:10:59,248
<i>Please!</i>

134
00:11:05,305 --> 00:11:07,256
<i>The man is a gambler.</i>

135
00:11:08,758 --> 00:11:10,426
He wages that a sailor's ship

136
00:11:10,428 --> 00:11:13,679
will make it to its destination.

137
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:16,098
It is a strange wager
for the captain.

138
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:18,767
He only wins
if he loses his life.

139
00:11:20,904 --> 00:11:23,939
So why would a captain make
the wager in the first place?

140
00:11:25,692 --> 00:11:28,427
A girl tells a man
that she has seen.

141
00:11:31,031 --> 00:11:33,165
If the captain dies,

142
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,484
the thin man pays
his family a lot of money.

143
00:11:37,871 --> 00:11:40,840
But perhaps the gambler
loses his bet

144
00:11:40,874 --> 00:11:43,125
and decides he does not
have to pay after all.

145
00:11:43,127 --> 00:11:45,461
A destitute woman
and her small child,

146
00:11:45,512 --> 00:11:49,298
what can they do to such a man if
he keeps their money for himself?

147
00:11:51,368 --> 00:11:53,969
To whom can they turn
for recourse?

148
00:11:59,976 --> 00:12:01,560
The Many-Faced God.

149
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,981
You said you didn't know
what I would see at the docks.

150
00:12:06,116 --> 00:12:09,084
A man had no idea what a girl
would see and what she would not.

151
00:12:11,154 --> 00:12:13,906
A girl named Lanna
will return to the docks.

152
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,691
She will watch the gambler.

153
00:12:15,725 --> 00:12:18,811
<i>She will come to know as much about
him as she knows about herself.</i>

154
00:12:18,845 --> 00:12:21,380
And then what?

155
00:12:21,414 --> 00:12:25,167
A gift for the thin man.

156
00:12:45,021 --> 00:12:47,189
She's not ready.

157
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,326
Perhaps she is,
perhaps she's not.

158
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,661
And if she's not?

159
00:12:52,696 --> 00:12:55,581
It is all the same
to the Many-Faced God.

160
00:13:18,605 --> 00:13:20,990
The trial will take place soon.

161
00:13:21,024 --> 00:13:23,025
<i>The High Sparrow
will be presenting</i>

162
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:24,860
<i>a substantial case against you.</i>

163
00:13:24,894 --> 00:13:26,128
The charges?

164
00:13:26,162 --> 00:13:28,530
<i>Fornication, treason, incest,</i>

165
00:13:28,598 --> 00:13:29,965
the murder of King Robert.

166
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,300
All lies.

167
00:13:31,334 --> 00:13:33,068
Of course, Your Grace.

168
00:13:37,624 --> 00:13:41,493
My concern is that
the Faith does not adhere

169
00:13:41,544 --> 00:13:44,980
to the same standards
of proof as the crown.

170
00:13:45,015 --> 00:13:46,849
<i>I hope you'll excuse me
for saying it,</i>

171
00:13:46,883 --> 00:13:49,518
<i>but belief is so often
the death of reason.</i>

172
00:13:49,552 --> 00:13:51,487
I wish you had said it sooner.

173
00:13:54,157 --> 00:13:55,624
Is there any word from Jaime?

174
00:13:55,659 --> 00:13:58,177
No, I'm afraid not.

175
00:14:04,517 --> 00:14:08,654
Your Grace,
Grand Maester Pycelle

176
00:14:08,688 --> 00:14:10,856
has summoned your Uncle Kevan

177
00:14:10,907 --> 00:14:12,441
back from Casterly Rock

178
00:14:12,475 --> 00:14:13,942
to serve as Hand of the King.

179
00:14:13,977 --> 00:14:16,629
He now presides
over the small council.

180
00:14:17,998 --> 00:14:20,282
Tell him I need to speak to him.

181
00:14:20,284 --> 00:14:22,751
I implored him to visit
you, but he would not.

182
00:14:27,123 --> 00:14:30,292
What about my son, the king?

183
00:14:30,343 --> 00:14:32,127
If you can visit me,
then surely the king...

184
00:14:32,178 --> 00:14:34,713
Your arrest and Queen
Margaery's arrest,

185
00:14:34,764 --> 00:14:36,131
the king has not
taken them well.

186
00:14:36,182 --> 00:14:38,050
<i>He remains in his chambers.</i>

187
00:14:38,101 --> 00:14:42,021
His servants often find his food
in the hall left untouched.

188
00:14:42,105 --> 00:14:43,555
You need to talk to him.

189
00:14:43,606 --> 00:14:45,887
You need to talk to my son and
tell him to come and see me,

190
00:14:45,892 --> 00:14:47,276
come and see his mother.

191
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:49,978
He-- I tried,
Your Grace.

192
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:52,314
He wouldn't see me.
He won't see anyone.

193
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:55,401
I can't stay here.

194
00:14:56,619 --> 00:14:59,738
There is a way, Your Grace.

195
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,077
A way out.

196
00:15:07,664 --> 00:15:09,498
Confess?

197
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:12,167
To the High Sparrow?

198
00:15:12,169 --> 00:15:14,336
I won't.

199
00:15:14,338 --> 00:15:17,222
I made him.

200
00:15:17,257 --> 00:15:19,174
I rose him up from nothing.

201
00:15:19,225 --> 00:15:22,010
I will not kneel before
some barefooted commoner

202
00:15:22,062 --> 00:15:24,513
and beg his forgiveness.

203
00:15:31,521 --> 00:15:34,106
Good-bye, my queen.

204
00:15:35,525 --> 00:15:37,559
The work continues.

205
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:14,813
Why?

206
00:16:16,483 --> 00:16:17,950
Why, Theon?

207
00:16:17,984 --> 00:16:21,120
I'm not Theon.
There is no Theon.

208
00:16:21,154 --> 00:16:22,654
- Reek.
- Reek.

209
00:16:22,705 --> 00:16:25,124
Why did you tell him, Reek?

210
00:16:26,209 --> 00:16:28,410
I was helping you.

211
00:16:28,461 --> 00:16:29,995
You wanted to escape.

212
00:16:30,046 --> 00:16:32,948
There is no escape.

213
00:16:32,982 --> 00:16:35,501
Not ever.

214
00:16:35,552 --> 00:16:38,887
Theon Greyjoy tried to escape.

215
00:16:38,922 --> 00:16:40,756
The master knew.

216
00:16:41,674 --> 00:16:44,393
He knows everything.

217
00:16:44,427 --> 00:16:46,762
He hunted him and caught him

218
00:16:46,764 --> 00:16:49,097
and strapped him to a cross

219
00:16:49,099 --> 00:16:51,517
and cut away piece after piece

220
00:16:51,568 --> 00:16:53,936
until there was no Theon left.

221
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:59,691
Good.

222
00:17:02,612 --> 00:17:06,782
If it weren't for you,
I'd still have a family.

223
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,284
If I could do
what Ramsay did to you

224
00:17:09,286 --> 00:17:12,171
right here, right now, I would.

225
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:18,293
I deserved everything.

226
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,631
I deserve to be Reek.

227
00:17:24,017 --> 00:17:26,134
<i>I did terrible things.</i>

228
00:17:27,887 --> 00:17:30,639
Turned on Robb.

229
00:17:30,641 --> 00:17:33,141
Captured Winterfell.

230
00:17:33,226 --> 00:17:35,727
- Killed those boys.
- They weren't "those boys."

231
00:17:35,778 --> 00:17:38,113
They were Bran and Rickon.
They were your brothers.

232
00:17:38,147 --> 00:17:39,731
You've known them
since they were born.

233
00:17:39,782 --> 00:17:41,316
They weren't.
They were only--

234
00:17:41,367 --> 00:17:43,068
Only what?

235
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:44,903
- I can't.
- Tell me.

236
00:17:44,954 --> 00:17:46,405
I can't, not unless
the master says.

237
00:17:46,456 --> 00:17:47,823
- Tell me. They weren't what?
- They weren't--

238
00:17:47,825 --> 00:17:50,659
Tell me why Bran
and Rickon should be gone

239
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:52,327
while you still breathe the air.

240
00:17:52,378 --> 00:17:53,629
Tell me to my face, Theon.

241
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:55,497
Tell me that they
weren't your brothers!

242
00:17:55,499 --> 00:17:57,049
They weren't Bran and Rickon!

243
00:17:59,052 --> 00:18:01,503
I couldn't find them.

244
00:18:07,844 --> 00:18:09,811
It was two farm boys.

245
00:18:13,816 --> 00:18:16,902
I killed them and burned
them so no one would know.

246
00:18:21,774 --> 00:18:24,359
You didn't?

247
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,662
Do you know where they
went, Bran and Rickon?

248
00:18:26,696 --> 00:18:28,280
I can't talk to you anymore.

249
00:18:28,331 --> 00:18:30,032
Theon, you have to tell me.
Do you have any idea where--

250
00:18:30,116 --> 00:18:32,534
Not Theon! Reek!

251
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:40,876
Our scouts tell us he's got
no more than 6,000 men.

252
00:18:40,878 --> 00:18:43,378
More than half of those
are mounted, however.

253
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,381
And how high do
Stannis's horses jump?

254
00:18:46,383 --> 00:18:48,767
Our walls have been
fully repaired.

255
00:18:48,801 --> 00:18:50,802
The gates have been reinforced.

256
00:18:50,853 --> 00:18:53,889
We have enough food
for six months.

257
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,726
We are more prepared for a
siege than they could ever be.

258
00:18:57,777 --> 00:19:00,395
All we have to do is
wait for them to freeze,

259
00:19:00,397 --> 00:19:03,231
starve, and mutiny.

260
00:19:06,302 --> 00:19:07,469
You disagree?

261
00:19:07,503 --> 00:19:09,821
Stannis isn't from the North.

262
00:19:09,872 --> 00:19:11,907
You are, Father.

263
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:15,177
I think you're missing an opportunity
to show the people of the North

264
00:19:15,211 --> 00:19:17,879
<i>how House Bolton
treats southern invaders.</i>

265
00:19:17,914 --> 00:19:19,164
And what do you recommend?

266
00:19:19,215 --> 00:19:20,499
<i>That we not sit
and wait for Stannis</i>

267
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:23,085
<i>to decide what sort of
fight this is going to be.</i>

268
00:19:23,087 --> 00:19:25,170
That we hit first and hit hard

269
00:19:25,221 --> 00:19:27,589
and leave a feast for the crows.

270
00:19:27,591 --> 00:19:30,592
A smart commander does not
abandon a defensive advantage.

271
00:19:30,643 --> 00:19:33,011
<i>As long as we stay
behind these walls,</i>

272
00:19:33,062 --> 00:19:34,346
<i>they can't touch us.</i>

273
00:19:34,397 --> 00:19:36,264
Not to mention
that the snow is so deep,

274
00:19:36,316 --> 00:19:38,076
we couldn't get an army
through to engage them

275
00:19:38,101 --> 00:19:39,401
even if we wanted to.

276
00:19:39,435 --> 00:19:41,687
I don't need an army.

277
00:19:41,738 --> 00:19:44,239
I need 20 good men.

278
00:19:52,081 --> 00:19:53,799
So, have you decided yet?

279
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:56,284
Whether I'm worthy
of your service?

280
00:19:58,338 --> 00:20:01,873
Have you decided yet whether
you're going to have me killed?

281
00:20:01,924 --> 00:20:04,126
It's probably my safest option.

282
00:20:06,963 --> 00:20:09,181
I can see why
you would think so.

283
00:20:09,215 --> 00:20:11,433
It's what your father
would have done.

284
00:20:12,685 --> 00:20:14,125
And what would
your father have done?

285
00:20:16,222 --> 00:20:17,806
My father,

286
00:20:17,808 --> 00:20:20,809
who publically
sentenced me to death?

287
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,362
I'd say his thoughts on having
me killed were abundantly clear.

288
00:20:23,396 --> 00:20:24,980
Is that why you killed him?

289
00:20:28,368 --> 00:20:31,653
Someday, if you decide
not to execute me,

290
00:20:31,655 --> 00:20:33,822
I'll tell you all about
why I killed my father.

291
00:20:33,873 --> 00:20:37,125
And on that day,
should it ever come,

292
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,461
we'll need more wine than this.

293
00:20:41,798 --> 00:20:44,166
I know what my father was.

294
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,752
<i>What he did.</i>

295
00:20:46,836 --> 00:20:49,137
I know the Mad King
earned his name.

296
00:20:51,891 --> 00:20:54,926
So, here we sit.

297
00:20:55,011 --> 00:20:57,979
Two terrible children
of two terrible fathers.

298
00:20:58,014 --> 00:20:59,681
I'm terrible?

299
00:20:59,732 --> 00:21:01,850
I've heard stories.

300
00:21:01,901 --> 00:21:05,237
Why did you travel to the far side of
the world to meet someone terrible?

301
00:21:05,271 --> 00:21:08,023
- To see if you were the right kind of terrible.
- Which kind is that?

302
00:21:08,025 --> 00:21:11,159
The kind that prevents your
people from being even more so.

303
00:21:13,162 --> 00:21:15,197
Well, I did reopen
the fighting pits.

304
00:21:15,248 --> 00:21:18,033
Under my rule, murder will once
again become entertainment.

305
00:21:18,084 --> 00:21:19,835
Yes, that was wise.

306
00:21:19,869 --> 00:21:23,121
And you agreed to marry someone
you loathe for the greater good.

307
00:21:23,206 --> 00:21:26,041
Very impressive.

308
00:21:26,043 --> 00:21:28,610
<i>My own sister married someone
she loathed as well,</i>

309
00:21:28,644 --> 00:21:31,179
though not by choice
and certainly not

310
00:21:31,214 --> 00:21:33,131
for the greater good,
gods forbid.

311
00:21:33,182 --> 00:21:34,900
She ended up having him killed.

312
00:21:36,736 --> 00:21:39,154
Perhaps it won't come to that.

313
00:21:46,729 --> 00:21:49,865
It's not impossible that Varys
was right about you after all.

314
00:21:49,899 --> 00:21:53,068
Varys?
King Robert's spymaster?

315
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:56,621
Yes, he's the one who convinced
me to come find you.

316
00:21:56,656 --> 00:21:58,240
He was my travelling companion

317
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:00,575
before Ser Jorah seized
that role for himself.

318
00:22:00,626 --> 00:22:03,295
Jorah sent my secrets to Varys.

319
00:22:03,329 --> 00:22:07,082
For 20 years the Spider oversaw
the campaign to find and kill me.

320
00:22:07,133 --> 00:22:09,918
He did what he had
to do to survive.

321
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,088
He did a lot of other things as
well, things he didn't have to do.

322
00:22:13,122 --> 00:22:17,008
<i>I suspect he's the main reason you
weren't slaughtered in your crib.</i>

323
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:18,810
But you trust him?

324
00:22:18,845 --> 00:22:20,345
<i>Yes, oddly.</i>

325
00:22:20,396 --> 00:22:23,598
He may be the only person
in the world I trust.

326
00:22:23,649 --> 00:22:25,517
Except my brother.

327
00:22:25,568 --> 00:22:28,603
The brother
who killed my father?

328
00:22:28,605 --> 00:22:29,688
That's the one.

329
00:22:29,772 --> 00:22:31,523
Perhaps I will have you
killed after all.

330
00:22:31,574 --> 00:22:33,775
Your queenly prerogative.

331
00:22:35,862 --> 00:22:38,413
I had given up on life

332
00:22:38,447 --> 00:22:41,867
until Varys convinced me
you might be worth living for.

333
00:22:41,934 --> 00:22:44,336
If you chop off my head, well,

334
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:46,421
my final days were interesting.

335
00:22:52,578 --> 00:22:54,563
I'm not going to kill you.

336
00:22:56,516 --> 00:22:59,351
No? Banish me?

337
00:22:59,385 --> 00:23:01,136
No.

338
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:02,804
So if I'm not going
to be murdered

339
00:23:02,855 --> 00:23:04,272
and I'm not going
to be banished--

340
00:23:04,307 --> 00:23:05,724
You're going to advise me.

341
00:23:07,476 --> 00:23:09,861
While you can still speak
in complete sentences.

342
00:23:13,816 --> 00:23:15,150
Advise you on what?

343
00:23:15,152 --> 00:23:16,735
How to get what I want.

344
00:23:16,786 --> 00:23:19,321
The Iron Throne.

345
00:23:19,323 --> 00:23:22,324
Perhaps you should try
wanting something else.

346
00:23:22,326 --> 00:23:24,826
If I want jokes, I'll get
myself a proper fool.

347
00:23:24,828 --> 00:23:27,162
<i>I'm not entirely joking.</i>

348
00:23:27,164 --> 00:23:29,664
<i>There's more to the world
than Westeros after all.</i>

349
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:34,002
How many hundreds of thousands of lives
have you changed for the better here?

350
00:23:34,053 --> 00:23:35,971
Perhaps this
is where you belong,

351
00:23:36,005 --> 00:23:38,006
where you can do the most good.

352
00:23:40,176 --> 00:23:42,894
I fought so that no child
born into Slaver's Bay

353
00:23:42,929 --> 00:23:46,014
would ever know what it
meant to be bought or sold.

354
00:23:46,065 --> 00:23:49,601
<i>I will continue
that fight here and beyond.</i>

355
00:23:49,652 --> 00:23:51,186
But this is not my home.

356
00:23:51,237 --> 00:23:53,989
When you get back to your
home, who supports you?

357
00:23:54,023 --> 00:23:55,523
The common people.

358
00:23:55,575 --> 00:23:58,193
Let's be generous and assume
that's going to happen.

359
00:23:58,195 --> 00:24:00,862
Here in Slaver's Bay, you had the
support of the common people

360
00:24:00,913 --> 00:24:03,365
and only the common people.

361
00:24:03,367 --> 00:24:07,252
What was that like?
Ruling without the rich?

362
00:24:07,286 --> 00:24:09,754
House Targaryen is gone.

363
00:24:09,789 --> 00:24:12,540
Not a single person who shares your
blood is alive to support you.

364
00:24:12,542 --> 00:24:14,542
<i>The Starks are gone as well.</i>

365
00:24:14,594 --> 00:24:16,511
<i>Our two terrible fathers
saw to that.</i>

366
00:24:16,545 --> 00:24:18,185
<i>The remaining members
of House Lannister</i>

367
00:24:18,214 --> 00:24:20,215
<i>will never back you, not ever.</i>

368
00:24:20,217 --> 00:24:22,517
Stannis Baratheon
won't back you, either.

369
00:24:22,551 --> 00:24:26,021
His entire claim to the throne rests
on the illegitimacy of yours.

370
00:24:26,055 --> 00:24:28,139
<i>That leaves the Tyrells.</i>

371
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:30,809
Not impossible, not enough.

372
00:24:30,893 --> 00:24:34,946
Lannister, Targaryen,
Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell.

373
00:24:34,981 --> 00:24:37,148
They're all just spokes
on a wheel.

374
00:24:37,199 --> 00:24:39,484
This one's on top,
then that one's on top.

375
00:24:39,568 --> 00:24:43,705
And on and on it spins,
crushing those on the ground.

376
00:24:43,739 --> 00:24:47,459
It's a beautiful dream,
stopping the wheel.

377
00:24:47,493 --> 00:24:50,161
You're not the first person
who's ever dreamt it.

378
00:24:50,212 --> 00:24:53,131
I'm not going to stop the wheel.

379
00:24:54,467 --> 00:24:56,918
I'm going to break the wheel.

380
00:25:19,442 --> 00:25:23,778
You said whoever wins will fight at
the Great Pit in front of the queen.

381
00:25:23,829 --> 00:25:25,780
I won.

382
00:25:25,782 --> 00:25:28,950
- You struck me.
- Have me flogged if it makes you happy.

383
00:25:28,952 --> 00:25:32,120
But I'm the best you've got.

384
00:25:32,171 --> 00:25:34,956
If I win at the Great Pit,

385
00:25:35,007 --> 00:25:36,925
how much can you sell me for?

386
00:25:39,795 --> 00:25:41,296
You're a free man.

387
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,598
You could have gone anywhere.

388
00:25:43,632 --> 00:25:45,300
Why did you come back?

389
00:25:50,189 --> 00:25:52,140
Let me fight for her

390
00:25:52,142 --> 00:25:54,192
and I belong to you.

391
00:25:59,448 --> 00:26:02,283
<i>Thirsty?</i>

392
00:26:02,351 --> 00:26:04,202
Confess.

393
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:10,992
I'll get out of here,
you realize, before long.

394
00:26:11,043 --> 00:26:12,243
Confess.

395
00:26:12,294 --> 00:26:15,547
I can make you a wealthy woman.

396
00:26:15,581 --> 00:26:17,265
A lady of the court.

397
00:26:17,299 --> 00:26:18,800
Confess.

398
00:26:23,439 --> 00:26:27,092
Or I can make sure you die in the
most hideous way imaginable.

399
00:26:27,143 --> 00:26:29,394
And all I do is sit here

400
00:26:29,428 --> 00:26:32,263
imagining hideous ways
for you to die.

401
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:19,561
Does it hurt?

402
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:23,064
No.

403
00:27:23,066 --> 00:27:25,316
Good.

404
00:27:28,571 --> 00:27:30,622
How are you?

405
00:27:30,656 --> 00:27:34,292
I'm not the one who got punched
and kicked in the face.

406
00:27:36,245 --> 00:27:38,163
You know what I mean.

407
00:27:39,965 --> 00:27:41,299
I'm good.

408
00:27:42,468 --> 00:27:44,919
- Are you scared?
- A little.

409
00:27:44,921 --> 00:27:46,921
Me, too.

410
00:27:50,643 --> 00:27:52,343
<i>- Who's there?
-  Olly.</i>

411
00:27:52,394 --> 00:27:54,395
Oh.

412
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:56,264
Come in.

413
00:27:58,767 --> 00:28:00,768
I heard what happened.

414
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:03,521
Oh, not to worry.

415
00:28:03,572 --> 00:28:06,774
Men brawl from time to time.
It's only natural.

416
00:28:09,361 --> 00:28:10,945
Figured you were hungry.

417
00:28:10,947 --> 00:28:14,532
Oh, you're a good lad.

418
00:28:16,368 --> 00:28:18,703
Wanted to ask you something

419
00:28:18,754 --> 00:28:20,588
if you've got the time.

420
00:28:20,623 --> 00:28:22,924
I need to check on baby Sam.

421
00:28:30,082 --> 00:28:33,301
<i>Now then, how can I help?</i>

422
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:36,688
- It's about the Lord Commander.
- Yes?

423
00:28:36,722 --> 00:28:39,807
He's going up to Hardhome
to save all them wildlings.

424
00:28:41,777 --> 00:28:45,046
Wildlings killed my mom and dad.

425
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,781
They killed everyone
in my village.

426
00:28:46,815 --> 00:28:48,533
We've been
fighting them for years.

427
00:28:48,617 --> 00:28:50,201
<i>This wasn't a fight.</i>

428
00:28:50,236 --> 00:28:53,755
We were farmers
and they slaughtered us.

429
00:28:55,324 --> 00:28:57,075
So why is he saving them?

430
00:28:57,126 --> 00:28:59,327
Wildlings are people.

431
00:28:59,329 --> 00:29:02,664
Just like us, there are
good ones and bad ones.

432
00:29:02,715 --> 00:29:06,134
The one he's travelling with,
the one with the red beard,

433
00:29:06,168 --> 00:29:08,136
he led the raid on my village.

434
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:10,471
<i>-  Oh, Olly.
- How can he trust him?</i>

435
00:29:11,891 --> 00:29:14,559
I've seen the army of the dead.

436
00:29:14,593 --> 00:29:17,595
<i>I've seen the white walkers.</i>

437
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:20,348
And they're coming for
us, for all the living.

438
00:29:22,651 --> 00:29:25,820
And when it's time,

439
00:29:25,854 --> 00:29:28,856
we'll need every
last man we can find.

440
00:29:28,858 --> 00:29:31,859
But what if we let the
wildlings through the gates

441
00:29:31,944 --> 00:29:33,745
and they cut our throats
while we sleep?

442
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:36,164
Jon's taking a risk,
but he has to.

443
00:29:36,198 --> 00:29:38,866
We don't stand
a chance otherwise.

444
00:29:38,918 --> 00:29:42,870
<i>Sometimes a man
has to make hard choices,</i>

445
00:29:42,872 --> 00:29:44,789
<i>choices that might look
wrong to others,</i>

446
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,592
<i>but you know are right
in the long run.</i>

447
00:29:47,626 --> 00:29:49,344
You believe that?

448
00:29:49,378 --> 00:29:51,512
With all my heart.

449
00:29:58,053 --> 00:30:00,355
<i>Try not to worry, Olly.</i>

450
00:30:00,389 --> 00:30:03,358
I've been worrying
about Jon for years.

451
00:30:03,392 --> 00:30:05,360
He always comes back.

452
00:30:47,603 --> 00:30:49,604
<i>Turn us about!</i>

453
00:31:22,221 --> 00:31:24,806
You trust me, Jon Snow?

454
00:31:24,857 --> 00:31:27,025
Does that make me a fool?

455
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:29,310
We're fools together now.

456
00:31:45,828 --> 00:31:48,713
Lord of Bones.

457
00:31:48,797 --> 00:31:51,165
Been a long time.

458
00:31:51,216 --> 00:31:54,085
Last time I saw you, the
little crow was your prisoner.

459
00:31:54,136 --> 00:31:56,504
The other way around now.
What happened?

460
00:31:56,506 --> 00:31:58,139
War.

461
00:31:58,173 --> 00:32:01,059
War?
You call that a war?

462
00:32:01,093 --> 00:32:03,261
The greatest army
the North has ever seen

463
00:32:03,312 --> 00:32:06,314
cut to pieces
by some southern king.

464
00:32:06,348 --> 00:32:08,483
We should gather the elders,

465
00:32:08,517 --> 00:32:10,401
find somewhere quiet to talk.

466
00:32:10,486 --> 00:32:12,353
You don't give the orders here.

467
00:32:12,355 --> 00:32:14,405
I'm not giving an order.

468
00:32:16,108 --> 00:32:17,942
Why aren't you in chains?

469
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:21,362
He's not my prisoner.

470
00:32:21,413 --> 00:32:22,663
No?

471
00:32:22,698 --> 00:32:24,532
What is he?

472
00:32:24,534 --> 00:32:26,250
We're allies.

473
00:32:27,836 --> 00:32:30,538
You fucking traitor.

474
00:32:33,542 --> 00:32:35,343
You fight for the crows now?

475
00:32:37,429 --> 00:32:39,964
I don't fight for the crows.

476
00:32:41,383 --> 00:32:44,886
We're not here to fight.
We're here to talk.

477
00:32:44,937 --> 00:32:47,305
Is that right?

478
00:32:47,356 --> 00:32:50,725
You and the pretty crow
do a lot of talking, Tormund?

479
00:32:50,727 --> 00:32:52,894
And when you're done talking,

480
00:32:52,896 --> 00:32:55,563
do you get down on your
knees and suck his cock?

481
00:33:11,246 --> 00:33:14,332
Gather the elders
and let's talk.

482
00:33:40,242 --> 00:33:42,610
My name's Jon Snow.

483
00:33:44,163 --> 00:33:46,447
I'm Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

484
00:33:49,168 --> 00:33:51,502
We're not friends.

485
00:33:51,537 --> 00:33:54,872
<i>We've never been friends.</i>

486
00:33:54,923 --> 00:33:57,341
<i>We won't become friends today.</i>

487
00:33:58,927 --> 00:34:01,012
<i>This isn't about friendship.</i>

488
00:34:02,881 --> 00:34:05,049
This is about survival.

489
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,134
This is about putting
a 700-foot wall

490
00:34:07,136 --> 00:34:09,720
between you
and what's out there.

491
00:34:09,771 --> 00:34:11,472
You built that wall
to keep us out.

492
00:34:11,474 --> 00:34:14,475
Since when do the crows
give two shits if we live?

493
00:34:14,526 --> 00:34:17,361
<i>In normal times we wouldn't.
But these aren't normal times.</i>

494
00:34:17,396 --> 00:34:20,815
The white walkers don't care
if a man's free folk or crow.

495
00:34:20,817 --> 00:34:23,985
We're all the same to them,
meat for their army.

496
00:34:24,036 --> 00:34:26,153
But together we can beat them.

497
00:34:26,205 --> 00:34:28,322
Beat the white walkers?

498
00:34:28,373 --> 00:34:31,242
Good luck with that.
Run from them, maybe.

499
00:34:41,053 --> 00:34:43,170
It's not a trick.

500
00:34:45,924 --> 00:34:49,010
It's a gift
for those who join us.

501
00:34:53,849 --> 00:34:56,851
Dragonglass.

502
00:34:56,853 --> 00:34:59,854
A man of the Night's Watch
used one of these daggers

503
00:34:59,905 --> 00:35:01,989
<i>to kill a walker.</i>

504
00:35:02,024 --> 00:35:04,442
- You saw this?
- No.

505
00:35:04,526 --> 00:35:06,027
But I trust the man.

506
00:35:06,078 --> 00:35:08,663
There are old stories
about dragonglass.

507
00:35:08,697 --> 00:35:12,166
There are old stories about
ice spiders as big as hounds.

508
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,368
And with the things we've
seen, you don't believe them?

509
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:17,204
<i>Come with me and
I'll share these weapons.</i>

510
00:35:17,206 --> 00:35:18,756
Come with you where?

511
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:20,550
<i>There are good lands
south of the Wall.</i>

512
00:35:20,592 --> 00:35:22,376
<i>The Night's Watch will let you
through the tunnel</i>

513
00:35:22,378 --> 00:35:24,795
and allow your people
to farm those lands.

514
00:35:27,884 --> 00:35:30,051
I knew Mance Rayder.

515
00:35:30,135 --> 00:35:32,270
<i>He never wanted a war
with the Night's Watch.</i>

516
00:35:32,304 --> 00:35:34,805
<i>He wanted a new life
for his people, for you.</i>

517
00:35:34,856 --> 00:35:37,275
We're prepared
to give you that new life.

518
00:35:37,309 --> 00:35:38,943
If?

519
00:35:38,977 --> 00:35:42,280
If you swear you'll join us
when the real war begins.

520
00:35:44,733 --> 00:35:46,317
Where is Mance?

521
00:35:49,655 --> 00:35:52,406
- He died.
- How?

522
00:35:57,663 --> 00:35:59,664
I put an arrow
through his heart.

523
00:35:59,715 --> 00:36:01,916
Hey, hey.

524
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,051
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

525
00:36:06,221 --> 00:36:07,588
Hey, hey, hey.

526
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:09,256
<i>I say we send the Lord Commander</i>

527
00:36:09,308 --> 00:36:13,094
back to Castle Black
with no eyes.

528
00:36:14,763 --> 00:36:17,064
Hey, none of you saw Mance die.

529
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:18,766
I did.

530
00:36:18,817 --> 00:36:22,236
The southern king who
broke our army, Stannis,

531
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:24,905
wanted to burn him alive
to send us a message.

532
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:27,908
Jon Snow defied
that cunt's orders.

533
00:36:29,111 --> 00:36:31,278
His arrow was mercy.

534
00:36:32,414 --> 00:36:33,698
What he did took courage.

535
00:36:33,749 --> 00:36:35,449
And that's what we need today,

536
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:37,118
the courage to make peace

537
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:40,371
with men we've been
killing for generations.

538
00:36:40,422 --> 00:36:42,623
I lost my father, my uncle,

539
00:36:42,625 --> 00:36:45,009
and two brothers
fighting the damn crows.

540
00:36:45,043 --> 00:36:48,129
I'm not asking you
to forget your dead.

541
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,297
I'll never forget mine.

542
00:36:52,134 --> 00:36:56,387
I lost 50 brothers the night
that Mance attacked the Wall.

543
00:36:57,356 --> 00:36:59,640
But I'm asking you

544
00:36:59,691 --> 00:37:01,776
to think about
your children now.

545
00:37:03,645 --> 00:37:05,285
<i>They'll never have
children of their own</i>

546
00:37:05,313 --> 00:37:07,732
<i>if we don't band together.</i>

547
00:37:07,816 --> 00:37:10,618
The Long Night is coming

548
00:37:10,652 --> 00:37:12,620
and the dead come with it.

549
00:37:12,654 --> 00:37:15,322
No clan can stop them.

550
00:37:15,374 --> 00:37:17,208
The free folk can't stop them.

551
00:37:17,242 --> 00:37:18,659
The Night's Watch
can't stop them.

552
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:22,129
And all the southern
kings can't stop them.

553
00:37:23,265 --> 00:37:25,833
<i>Only together, all of us.</i>

554
00:37:25,884 --> 00:37:27,635
And even then
it may not be enough,

555
00:37:27,669 --> 00:37:29,920
but at least we'll give
the fuckers a fight.

556
00:37:45,487 --> 00:37:48,022
You vouch for this man, Tormund?

557
00:37:50,609 --> 00:37:53,611
He's prettier
than both my daughters,

558
00:37:53,662 --> 00:37:55,529
<i>but he knows how to fight.</i>

559
00:37:55,531 --> 00:37:58,416
He's young, but he
knows how to lead.

560
00:37:59,918 --> 00:38:01,585
He didn't have
to come to Hardhome.

561
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:05,756
He came because he needs us

562
00:38:05,791 --> 00:38:07,842
and we need him.

563
00:38:11,713 --> 00:38:13,714
My ancestors would spit on me

564
00:38:13,765 --> 00:38:15,883
if I broke bread with a crow.

565
00:38:15,934 --> 00:38:18,803
So would mine, but fuck
'em, they're dead.

566
00:38:28,196 --> 00:38:30,481
I'll never trust a man in black.

567
00:38:34,569 --> 00:38:37,071
But I trust you, Tormund.

568
00:38:37,122 --> 00:38:40,458
If you say this is the way,

569
00:38:40,492 --> 00:38:41,742
we're with you.

570
00:38:45,831 --> 00:38:48,415
This is the way.

571
00:38:49,468 --> 00:38:51,252
<i>I'm with Tormund.</i>

572
00:38:51,303 --> 00:38:53,637
We stay here, we're dead men.

573
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:58,342
At least with King Crow,
there's a chance.

574
00:39:01,062 --> 00:39:04,181
Tormund.

575
00:39:07,235 --> 00:39:10,020
Keep that new life
you want to give us.

576
00:39:12,774 --> 00:39:15,359
And keep your glass, King Crow.

577
00:39:17,445 --> 00:39:21,198
As soon as you get on his ships,
they're gonna slit your throats

578
00:39:21,249 --> 00:39:24,201
and dump your bodies to the
bottom of the Shivering Sea.

579
00:39:26,204 --> 00:39:28,205
That's our enemy.

580
00:39:29,841 --> 00:39:31,959
That has always been our enemy.

581
00:39:47,859 --> 00:39:49,643
I fucking hate Thenns.

582
00:40:09,614 --> 00:40:12,166
- Move it.
- Be careful.

583
00:40:12,168 --> 00:40:14,051
<i>- Move 'em along, now.
- Cast-off time.</i>

584
00:40:14,085 --> 00:40:16,053
<i>That's it, come on.</i>

585
00:40:18,757 --> 00:40:21,225
How many are with us?
5,000?

586
00:40:21,259 --> 00:40:23,427
I'm not good at counting.

587
00:40:24,763 --> 00:40:26,480
We're leaving too many behind.

588
00:40:26,514 --> 00:40:28,015
The free folk are stubborn.

589
00:40:28,017 --> 00:40:30,517
You know how long it took
Mance to band them together?

590
00:40:30,569 --> 00:40:33,070
20 fucking years.

591
00:40:33,154 --> 00:40:36,156
And he knew them better
than I ever will.

592
00:40:36,191 --> 00:40:40,494
They're running out of food
and there's nothing to hunt.

593
00:40:40,528 --> 00:40:42,029
They'll come around.

594
00:40:44,866 --> 00:40:47,368
<i>- Get yourselves ready.
- Aye!</i>

595
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:49,169
Johnna is gonna look after you.

596
00:40:49,204 --> 00:40:51,956
She's in charge.
You listen to her.

597
00:40:53,041 --> 00:40:55,676
<i>Take her. There you are.</i>

598
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:57,044
I want to go with you.

599
00:40:57,046 --> 00:40:59,713
I need to get the old
folks on the boats.

600
00:40:59,715 --> 00:41:01,966
I'm right behind you.
I promise.

601
00:41:05,887 --> 00:41:07,521
Go on.

602
00:41:09,891 --> 00:41:11,108
<i>Another one.</i>

603
00:41:11,142 --> 00:41:14,061
<i>Keep moving.
We'll meet you out there.</i>

604
00:41:16,731 --> 00:41:19,366
<i>Won't be able to take that on the boat.
It's too big.</i>

605
00:41:19,401 --> 00:41:22,903
<i>-  That's the last one!
-  Three more! Move on!</i>

606
00:41:22,905 --> 00:41:26,490
<i>There's more dragonglass everywhere.</i>

607
00:41:32,747 --> 00:41:35,499
<i>I've got some more daggers
over here.</i>

608
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:37,968
<i>Put that dagger in his bag.</i>

609
00:41:40,588 --> 00:41:42,589
Uh...

610
00:42:34,275 --> 00:42:38,112
<i>Steady!</i>

611
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:57,881
Shut the gates.

612
00:42:57,966 --> 00:42:59,717
<i>Close the gates!</i>

613
00:43:04,005 --> 00:43:05,839
Shut the gates!

614
00:43:09,227 --> 00:43:11,345
Wait!

615
00:43:11,396 --> 00:43:14,148
- Open the gate!
- Let us in!

616
00:43:15,183 --> 00:43:17,351
Help us!

617
00:43:27,028 --> 00:43:29,363
<i>Please open it!</i>

618
00:43:29,414 --> 00:43:31,949
<i>Open the gate!</i>

619
00:44:17,462 --> 00:44:19,663
<i>Ready your arrows!</i>

620
00:44:38,933 --> 00:44:42,102
- Wait! Wait!
- Keep in line! Keep in line!

621
00:44:42,104 --> 00:44:44,438
Get in line!

622
00:45:44,549 --> 00:45:47,167
Get to the front!

623
00:45:47,218 --> 00:45:49,169
<i>Go on, shoot it!</i>

624
00:45:55,677 --> 00:45:59,846
<i>- Wait, wait!
- Duncan, hold the line! Hold the line!</i>

625
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:06,353
Lord Commander!

626
00:46:06,437 --> 00:46:08,739
Get them to the ship
and come back for me!

627
00:46:08,773 --> 00:46:10,407
- But you'll never make--
- Now!

628
00:46:13,444 --> 00:46:16,446
- Let me on!
- Let me on!

629
00:46:16,531 --> 00:46:18,665
- Bloody fucking move!
- Let go!

630
00:46:19,867 --> 00:46:21,368
You should be on
one of those boats.

631
00:46:21,370 --> 00:46:24,087
So should you.
My little girls got on.

632
00:46:24,122 --> 00:46:26,290
They're gonna let them pass the
Wall even if you're not there?

633
00:46:26,374 --> 00:46:28,959
You have my word.
I've given orders.

634
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:31,712
Don't think you're gonna be
there to enforce those orders.

635
00:46:33,882 --> 00:46:36,350
If they get through,
everyone dies.

636
00:46:39,938 --> 00:46:42,856
Night's Watch, with me!

637
00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:46,193
Move! Move!

638
00:46:46,227 --> 00:46:48,028
Move!

639
00:47:53,177 --> 00:47:54,294
No, no!

640
00:48:04,138 --> 00:48:06,940
<i>- Tormund, the sleigh!
- Okay, okay!</i>

641
00:48:55,189 --> 00:48:56,573
The dragonglass.

642
00:48:56,607 --> 00:48:58,692
You and me, then!

643
00:48:59,744 --> 00:49:01,361
Go!

644
00:50:11,432 --> 00:50:13,433
Get the glass.

645
00:53:18,919 --> 00:53:20,620
Come on!

646
00:53:20,622 --> 00:53:22,288
The dragonglass.

647
00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:25,792
Fuck the glass!
We are gonna die here!

648
00:53:56,290 --> 00:53:58,825
Oh, fuck!

649
00:54:04,832 --> 00:54:07,667
<i>Tormund, run!</i>

650
00:54:15,843 --> 00:54:18,978
Wun Wun, to the sea.

651
00:55:00,054 --> 00:55:02,555
<i>Quickly!</i>

652
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:05,058
<i>-  Faster, faster!
-  Run, run!</i>

653
00:55:05,109 --> 00:55:07,060
<i>Quickly!</i>

654
00:55:09,063 --> 00:55:12,065
- Quickly, row! Row!
- Go, go, come on!

655
00:55:41,061 --> 00:55:44,230
Let's go!
Now, now!

656
00:55:48,235 --> 00:55:50,487
<i>Come on, row!</i>
