1
00:02:32,006 --> 00:02:35,392
- Look out!
- Fire! Fire!

2
00:03:01,002 --> 00:03:03,620
A band of 20 men, maybe less.

3
00:03:03,671 --> 00:03:05,872
They were in and out
before anyone spotted them.

4
00:03:05,874 --> 00:03:07,841
Burnt our food stores to the ground,

5
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:10,093
all our siege weapons destroyed.

6
00:03:10,128 --> 00:03:12,462
- Dozens of tents were...
- Horses?

7
00:03:12,513 --> 00:03:14,631
We're still getting a
count, but hundreds are dead.

8
00:03:14,682 --> 00:03:18,352
20 men rode into our camp without
a single guard sounding the alarm?

9
00:03:18,386 --> 00:03:20,887
The northerners know more about
their land than we ever will.

10
00:03:20,938 --> 00:03:22,556
Put last night's guards in chains.

11
00:03:22,558 --> 00:03:24,274
Either they fell asleep or
they conspired with the enemy.

12
00:03:24,308 --> 00:03:27,894
- Find out the truth and then hang them.
- Your Grace.

13
00:03:27,896 --> 00:03:31,148
Unless there's a thaw, we can't
press forward to Winterfell

14
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:33,784
and we don't have enough food
to get us back to Castle Black.

15
00:03:33,818 --> 00:03:35,652
We're not returning to Castle Black.

16
00:03:35,703 --> 00:03:39,072
Forgive me, Your Grace, I never claimed
to be an expert in military matters,

17
00:03:39,123 --> 00:03:42,709
but if we can't march forward
and we won't march back...

18
00:03:55,973 --> 00:03:58,592
Have the dead horses butchered for meat.

19
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,468
Halt!

20
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:44,438
Halt!

21
00:04:46,974 --> 00:04:49,643
There it is!

22
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,485
Open the gates.

23
00:05:47,034 --> 00:05:49,486
It was a failure.

24
00:05:49,554 --> 00:05:52,289
It wasn't.

25
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,541
I went to save them. I failed.

26
00:05:56,344 --> 00:05:58,378
You didn't fail him.

27
00:05:58,429 --> 00:05:59,763
Or him.

28
00:05:59,797 --> 00:06:02,599
Or her.

29
00:06:02,633 --> 00:06:06,102
Every one of them is alive
because of you and no one else.

30
00:06:07,555 --> 00:06:10,056
I don't think that fact's lost on them.

31
00:07:04,078 --> 00:07:07,414
You have a good heart, Jon Snow.

32
00:07:07,448 --> 00:07:09,916
It'll get us all killed.

33
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,874
Out of my way.

34
00:07:43,985 --> 00:07:45,485
You sent for me, Your Grace?

35
00:07:45,536 --> 00:07:47,787
Find some healthy horses and
a few knights to guard you.

36
00:07:47,822 --> 00:07:49,823
I'm sending you back to Castle Black.

37
00:07:49,825 --> 00:07:52,075
Tell the Lord Commander
his king commands him

38
00:07:52,126 --> 00:07:54,494
to send food, supplies, fresh horses.

39
00:07:54,528 --> 00:07:56,296
In return, when I take the throne,

40
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:59,332
I'll make sure the Night's Watch
has all the men it requires.

41
00:07:59,334 --> 00:08:02,669
He can guard all 19 castles
on the Wall if he so wishes.

42
00:08:04,972 --> 00:08:07,974
Your Grace, you named me your Hand.

43
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:09,576
Yes.

44
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:11,561
The King's Hand should
never abandon the king,

45
00:08:11,595 --> 00:08:13,013
especially in time of war.

46
00:08:13,015 --> 00:08:14,864
You're not abandoning me.
You're obeying a command.

47
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:17,317
A boy with a scroll could
deliver this message.

48
00:08:17,351 --> 00:08:19,903
And if Jon Snow refuses
the boy with the scroll,

49
00:08:19,937 --> 00:08:22,155
what does the boy say?

50
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:24,357
I didn't name you Hand for your
expertise in military matters.

51
00:08:24,359 --> 00:08:26,860
Ride for Castle Black.
Don't come back empty-handed.

52
00:08:33,617 --> 00:08:35,669
Your Grace, perhaps Queen Selyse

53
00:08:35,703 --> 00:08:37,587
and Princess Shireen could accompany me.

54
00:08:37,621 --> 00:08:39,673
My family stays with me.

55
00:08:39,707 --> 00:08:41,708
At least let me take Shireen.

56
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:44,294
A siege is no place for a little girl.

57
00:08:44,345 --> 00:08:46,713
My family stays with me.

58
00:09:23,238 --> 00:09:24,572
What's this one now?

59
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,941
"The Dance of Dragons: A True Telling"

60
00:09:26,992 --> 00:09:28,409
by Grand Maester Munkun.

61
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:31,779
Now that sounds like a proper story.

62
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:34,448
Ser Byron Swann wanted
to kill the dragon Vhagar.

63
00:09:34,499 --> 00:09:37,451
He polished his shield for a
week so that it was like a mirror.

64
00:09:37,502 --> 00:09:39,537
And he crouched behind
it and crept forward,

65
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:41,589
hoping the dragon would
only see its own reflection.

66
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:44,708
But the dragon saw a dumb
man holding a mirrored shield.

67
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:46,427
And burnt him to a crisp.

68
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:50,047
Thus ending the dragon-slaying career

69
00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:52,883
of Ser Byron Swann.

70
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,521
I made you something, Princess.

71
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,396
Do you like it?

72
00:10:05,398 --> 00:10:07,314
He's beautiful.

73
00:10:07,365 --> 00:10:10,067
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

74
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:12,620
Will you make me a doe, too?
So that he can have company?

75
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:14,488
Of course I will.

76
00:10:15,957 --> 00:10:17,575
But why am I getting a present?

77
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,661
Because you deserve it.

78
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,833
My son was always on me,
trying to teach me to read.

79
00:10:25,884 --> 00:10:28,219
Gods, I was stubborn about it.

80
00:10:29,554 --> 00:10:31,171
Made it this far without reading.

81
00:10:31,223 --> 00:10:33,724
Seemed to me I could make it to the grave.

82
00:10:35,977 --> 00:10:37,928
Wish I'd listened to him.

83
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:41,765
This is my own poor
way of saying thank you.

84
00:10:45,403 --> 00:10:47,571
For teaching me to be a grown-up.

85
00:10:50,242 --> 00:10:53,027
I'll be gone for a few days, Princess.

86
00:10:53,078 --> 00:10:55,746
I want to hear all about "The
Dance of Dragons" when I'm back.

87
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,032
You'll read it yourself.

88
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:20,971
Prince Doran.

89
00:11:21,022 --> 00:11:23,607
Forgive us. We started without you.

90
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:26,360
Please, sit.

91
00:11:26,444 --> 00:11:28,896
Princess Myrcella.

92
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,564
Uncle.

93
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:32,449
What a lovely dress.

94
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:34,785
- You don't like it?
- You must be cold.

95
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:38,455
Not at all. The Dornish
climate agrees with me.

96
00:11:39,624 --> 00:11:42,326
Prince Trystane.

97
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:45,663
How's your jaw?

98
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:47,565
A fleabite.

99
00:11:48,076 --> 00:11:49,709
What are you doing in Dorne?

100
00:11:49,743 --> 00:11:52,011
Looking after the safety of my
niece, the Princess Myrcella.

101
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:55,381
And rather than send a raven
or speak to me directly,

102
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:57,750
you decided to enter my country in secret

103
00:11:57,752 --> 00:11:59,418
and abduct our guest by force?

104
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,672
We received a threatening message.

105
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:05,925
The princess's necklace
in the jaws of a viper.

106
00:12:07,261 --> 00:12:09,262
That necklace was stolen from my room.

107
00:12:14,251 --> 00:12:18,020
Oh, excellent.

108
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,273
A last meal before the beheading?

109
00:12:20,275 --> 00:12:21,857
Oh, I can't behead you.

110
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:24,327
Many in Dorne want war.

111
00:12:24,361 --> 00:12:26,345
But I've seen war.

112
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,115
I've seen the bodies
piled on the battlefields.

113
00:12:29,117 --> 00:12:32,635
I've seen the orphans
starving in the cities.

114
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,754
I don't want to lead my
people into that hell.

115
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:37,456
No, you want to break
bread with the Lannisters.

116
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:40,126
And that is precisely what we are doing.

117
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:45,548
Let us drink to Tommen,
the First of His Name,

118
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:48,084
King of the Andals and the First Men,

119
00:12:48,118 --> 00:12:50,303
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.

120
00:13:07,738 --> 00:13:10,156
King Tommen insists

121
00:13:10,158 --> 00:13:13,159
on his sister's return to the capital?

122
00:13:13,161 --> 00:13:15,328
I'm afraid he does.

123
00:13:17,331 --> 00:13:20,466
I cannot disobey my king's command.

124
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,969
She will return with you to King's Landing.

125
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:26,422
And my son Prince Trystane
will accompany you both.

126
00:13:26,456 --> 00:13:30,092
If the alliance between the Iron
Throne and Dorne is to continue,

127
00:13:30,177 --> 00:13:31,594
their engagement must stand.

128
00:13:31,662 --> 00:13:33,729
I accept.

129
00:13:33,764 --> 00:13:36,432
One more thing. My brother was named

130
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:39,151
to the small council before his death.

131
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:41,103
Your father understood the importance

132
00:13:41,138 --> 00:13:42,972
of keeping Dorne in the fold.

133
00:13:43,006 --> 00:13:47,576
With Oberyn gone, Trystane will
take his place on the small council.

134
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:48,761
You have my word.

135
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:51,280
The word of a kingslayer.

136
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:57,837
No wonder you can't
stand. You have no spine.

137
00:13:57,871 --> 00:14:00,122
You are mother to four of my nieces,

138
00:14:00,207 --> 00:14:01,924
girls I love very much.

139
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:04,760
For their sake, I hope you
live a long and happy life.

140
00:14:04,795 --> 00:14:07,296
Speak to me that way again, and you won't.

141
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:18,774
May I inquire as to the
fate of my man Bronn?

142
00:14:18,809 --> 00:14:21,894
Tell me, Ser Jaime, in King's Landing,

143
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:25,231
how do they punish a
commoner who strikes a prince?

144
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:26,832
He said it was just a fleabite.

145
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:30,986
The fault is mine.

146
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:33,272
Bronn is merely a soldier
following my orders.

147
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,876
If anyone should be punished, it's me.

148
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,745
Prince Trystane must learn
judgment if he is to rule one day.

149
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:41,547
I'll let him decide.

150
00:14:46,336 --> 00:14:48,971
I have learned the value
of mercy from my father.

151
00:14:49,005 --> 00:14:52,408
-  I'll set your man free.
- You're a good man.

152
00:14:52,442 --> 00:14:55,294
On one condition.

153
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:05,354
Why do we play? I'm better than you.

154
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,740
I'll always be better than you.

155
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:10,609
Have I ever missed once?

156
00:15:10,611 --> 00:15:13,529
I don't think I have. I can't recall.

157
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,165
You must love humiliation. Or pain.

158
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:19,869
Which do you love most,
humiliation or pain?

159
00:15:20,954 --> 00:15:22,838
That one hurt, didn't it?

160
00:15:22,873 --> 00:15:25,841
You going to cry?

161
00:15:25,876 --> 00:15:27,793
Give up, little sister.

162
00:15:27,795 --> 00:15:29,879
- You're going to miss.
- Oh, I never miss.

163
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:33,215
You will. You're thinking too much.

164
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:36,302
Now you're nervous. What if she's right?

165
00:15:39,723 --> 00:15:42,525
- Luck.
- Now it's my turn.

166
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:44,193
You're too slow.

167
00:15:44,227 --> 00:15:46,061
You've always been too slow.

168
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:04,663
Am I gonna be happy at
the end of this walk?

169
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:06,749
You'll find out very soon.

170
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:11,504
Say it one more time, handsome.

171
00:16:11,506 --> 00:16:12,972
Who am I?

172
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,892
The most beautiful woman in the world.

173
00:16:16,927 --> 00:16:18,310
And that's the truth.

174
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:20,980
Slut.

175
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:22,982
Prince Doran,

176
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:26,018
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

177
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:28,437
I didn't realize there were
knights of the Blackwater.

178
00:16:28,471 --> 00:16:30,072
Only the one.

179
00:16:30,106 --> 00:16:32,658
I believe you've already
met Prince Trystane.

180
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:34,860
Prince.

181
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:36,662
Sorry about the other day.

182
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:39,165
Prince Trystane here is a man of mercy.

183
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,534
He's agreed to grant you your freedom.

184
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,204
I'm glad to hear it.

185
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:48,040
Pie looks good.

186
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:50,709
There was one condition.

187
00:16:59,803 --> 00:17:02,137
Perhaps some soup instead.

188
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:07,526
Oysters, clams, and cockles.

189
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,481
Oysters, clams, and cockles.

190
00:17:12,566 --> 00:17:16,368
Oysters, clams, and cockles.

191
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:18,571
Oysters, clams, and cock...

192
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:20,289
How much for your little clam?

193
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:31,800
Oysters, clams, and cockles.

194
00:17:34,671 --> 00:17:37,723
Oysters, clams, and cockles.

195
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:07,620
Come on.

196
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:12,675
Some oysters, girl!

197
00:18:12,709 --> 00:18:15,377
I'm talking to you.

198
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,763
Is, uh...

199
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,100
- Girl!
-  Tie her up!

200
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:24,520
Are you deaf? Girl!

201
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:27,523
Girl!

202
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:34,313
My lord.

203
00:18:37,901 --> 00:18:39,952
My lord.

204
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:41,737
Lord Tyrell.

205
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,322
On behalf of the Iron Bank,

206
00:18:43,324 --> 00:18:45,291
may I be the first to welcome you

207
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:47,042
to the Free City of Braavos.

208
00:18:47,077 --> 00:18:49,044
I hope your journey was trouble-free.

209
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:50,796
A bit of chop the last few days.

210
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,915
Nothing too awful.

211
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:55,384
Good to see the old chap
still guarding the harbor.

212
00:18:55,418 --> 00:18:57,720
And how goes the harvest in the Reach?

213
00:18:57,754 --> 00:19:00,139
Ah, the vintners say this might be

214
00:19:00,173 --> 00:19:03,342
the best year for red
grapes in half a century.

215
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:06,478
If we come to a satisfactory arrangement,

216
00:19:06,513 --> 00:19:11,350
I'll be sure to send a cask
of the Arbor's finest your way.

217
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:14,019
I'm afraid I don't partake.

218
00:19:14,021 --> 00:19:16,071
Oh.

219
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:25,781
Some consider usury
distasteful, dishonorable.

220
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,449
Pure nonsense, of course.

221
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,785
I'm glad we see eye to eye on this matter.

222
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:32,204
Did you know that at one
point Maegor the third

223
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:35,090
tried to outlaw it in the Seven Kingdoms?

224
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:37,259
Wanted to arrest anyone
caught charging interest

225
00:19:37,293 --> 00:19:39,962
and cut off both their hands.

226
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:42,097
Most unfortunate for the glovers.

227
00:19:42,132 --> 00:19:44,266
If a man charges no interest on a loan,

228
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,418
then he has nothing to
gain and everything to lose,

229
00:19:46,453 --> 00:19:47,886
so why chance it?

230
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,688
Whereas the promise of reward

231
00:19:49,723 --> 00:19:52,274
makes a man willing to gamble.

232
00:19:52,308 --> 00:19:55,728
We are not gamblers here at
the Iron Bank, Lord Tyrell.

233
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:58,197
You are the world's best gamblers.

234
00:19:58,231 --> 00:20:02,067
And all those bets you won built this.

235
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:14,663
We should celebrate.

236
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:17,216
I'm afraid I still have
a good deal of work to do.

237
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,334
Oh, nonsense. Work's over. Do you sing?

238
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:21,086
- I don't have that gift.
- Oh, it's not a gift.

239
00:20:21,088 --> 00:20:22,254
It's a skill. Anyone can learn it.

240
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:26,842
# So give me a kiss by the Long Canal #

241
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:30,813
# And give me two kisses in Salty Town #

242
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:35,851
# For we're going to die tomorrow #

243
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:39,521
# The bareheaded beggar,
the king with his crown... #

244
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,657
Thought that old shit
would never stop singing.

245
00:20:41,691 --> 00:20:43,659
Wasn't bad, though.

246
00:20:43,693 --> 00:20:46,278
The Tyrells can all rot in hell.

247
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:47,996
Treasonous cunts.

248
00:20:48,031 --> 00:20:50,916
They were going to make
that boy-fucker Renly king.

249
00:20:52,118 --> 00:20:53,869
This is the place, lads.

250
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,338
The sleekest little minks in Braavos.

251
00:20:56,372 --> 00:20:59,258
- You buying?
- Oh, I'm buying.

252
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:01,460
But I never was good at sharing.

253
00:21:22,315 --> 00:21:24,650
Sell your fish somewhere else.

254
00:21:24,652 --> 00:21:27,536
Oh, let her in, Brusco. I'm hungry.

255
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:29,488
Come here, sweetness.

256
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,495
They say oysters get the juices flowing.

257
00:21:36,497 --> 00:21:38,747
We'll take half a dozen.

258
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,417
Three coppers.

259
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:45,838
Here's a silver because the lady likes you.

260
00:22:11,948 --> 00:22:13,949
Too old.

261
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:18,704
Brea.

262
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:35,437
Too old.

263
00:22:37,473 --> 00:22:40,976
I have just the one. Anara.

264
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:44,396
Our most expensive girl.

265
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:48,617
But well worth it, I assure you.

266
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:55,424
Too old.

267
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:05,117
Do you have what I want or not?

268
00:23:05,151 --> 00:23:09,004
Of course. Of course.

269
00:23:14,427 --> 00:23:16,428
These fresh?

270
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:23,068
Come on, the lads are hungry.

271
00:23:26,439 --> 00:23:30,859
Nothing better for your
cockstand than fresh oysters.

272
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,950
- Here. Thank you.
- I'll have one.

273
00:23:34,113 --> 00:23:35,981
Any vinegar?

274
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,268
Who let this girl in? Shoo! Shoo!

275
00:23:59,689 --> 00:24:01,807
Good.

276
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:12,985
I'll tell you when we're done.

277
00:24:18,658 --> 00:24:20,659
You'll have a fresh one for me tomorrow?

278
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:23,045
Of course.

279
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,251
I'll have you whipped, girl.

280
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:31,670
Go, go on. Out, out, go.

281
00:24:43,516 --> 00:24:45,434
Valar morghulis.

282
00:24:45,518 --> 00:24:47,519
Valar morghulis.

283
00:25:02,952 --> 00:25:04,369
And?

284
00:25:04,371 --> 00:25:07,122
The thin man wasn't hungry today.

285
00:25:07,156 --> 00:25:09,257
Perhaps that is why a man is thin.

286
00:25:09,292 --> 00:25:11,043
Tomorrow.

287
00:25:11,077 --> 00:25:14,212
Tomorrow.

288
00:25:15,298 --> 00:25:17,332
A girl has work to do.

289
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:34,182
Your rebellion is over.

290
00:25:34,217 --> 00:25:37,018
You can swear your allegiance to me now...

291
00:25:38,488 --> 00:25:40,405
or you can die.

292
00:26:15,608 --> 00:26:17,909
I believe in second chances.

293
00:26:19,862 --> 00:26:22,614
I don't believe in third chances.

294
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,978
You write like a seven-year-old.

295
00:26:54,564 --> 00:26:56,815
Your maester kindly agreed
to copy it over for me.

296
00:26:56,866 --> 00:26:58,366
He didn't try to make you pay?

297
00:26:58,401 --> 00:27:00,118
Mm-mmm.

298
00:27:00,153 --> 00:27:02,287
Maybe he's changed.

299
00:27:02,321 --> 00:27:05,574
The queen will be thrilled to know
you're bringing her daughter home.

300
00:27:05,658 --> 00:27:06,875
She will.

301
00:27:06,909 --> 00:27:09,327
You love her very much, don't you?

302
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:11,880
Of course, she's my niece.

303
00:27:11,914 --> 00:27:13,832
I wasn't talking about her.

304
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,836
You think I disapprove?

305
00:27:17,838 --> 00:27:19,504
Why?

306
00:27:19,506 --> 00:27:22,507
Because people disapprove of that
sort of thing where you are from?

307
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:25,727
They disapproved of Oberyn
and me where you are from.

308
00:27:25,761 --> 00:27:29,481
Here no one blinked an eye.

309
00:27:30,766 --> 00:27:31,983
100 years ago,

310
00:27:32,018 --> 00:27:34,686
no one would have blinked an eye at you

311
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:36,521
if you'd been named Targaryen.

312
00:27:38,374 --> 00:27:42,494
It's always changing, who we're
supposed to love and who we're not.

313
00:27:43,696 --> 00:27:45,864
The only thing that stays the same

314
00:27:45,866 --> 00:27:48,733
is that we want who we want.

315
00:27:58,461 --> 00:28:00,846
I know your daughter had no
part in the terrible thing

316
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,014
that happened to the man I love.

317
00:28:05,701 --> 00:28:08,186
Perhaps even you are innocent of that.

318
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:28,623
Father.

319
00:28:32,078 --> 00:28:33,411
Aren't you cold?

320
00:28:35,748 --> 00:28:37,832
No. What are you reading?

321
00:28:39,302 --> 00:28:41,469
- "The Dance of Dragons."
- What's it about?

322
00:28:41,504 --> 00:28:43,989
It's the story of the fight
between Rhaenyra Targaryen

323
00:28:44,023 --> 00:28:47,309
and her half-brother Aegon for
control over the Seven Kingdoms.

324
00:28:47,343 --> 00:28:50,145
Both of them thought they
belonged on the Iron Throne.

325
00:28:50,179 --> 00:28:53,431
When people started declaring
for one of them or the other,

326
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:55,734
their fight divided the kingdoms in two.

327
00:28:55,768 --> 00:28:59,154
Brothers fought brothers,
dragons fought dragons.

328
00:29:00,823 --> 00:29:04,776
By the time it was over,
thousands were dead.

329
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:07,779
And it was a disaster for
the Targaryens as well.

330
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:10,582
They never truly recovered.

331
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:12,617
"The Dance of Dragons."

332
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:16,421
Why is that a dance?

333
00:29:16,455 --> 00:29:17,923
It's just what they call it.

334
00:29:17,957 --> 00:29:20,125
Hmm, doesn't make much sense.

335
00:29:20,209 --> 00:29:22,127
I think it's poetic.

336
00:29:28,968 --> 00:29:31,519
If you had to choose

337
00:29:31,554 --> 00:29:34,889
between Rhaenyra and Aegon...

338
00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:37,976
who would you have chosen?

339
00:29:37,978 --> 00:29:40,562
I wouldn't have chosen either.

340
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:43,782
It's all the choosing sides
that made everything so horrible.

341
00:29:43,816 --> 00:29:46,117
Sometimes a person has to choose.

342
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:51,456
Sometimes the world forces his hand.

343
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:56,328
If a man knows what he is...

344
00:29:57,713 --> 00:30:00,548
and remains true to himself...

345
00:30:04,003 --> 00:30:06,221
the choice is no choice at all.

346
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:09,341
He must fulfill his destiny...

347
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:15,013
and become who he is meant to be.

348
00:30:17,216 --> 00:30:19,567
However much he may hate it.

349
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,688
It's all right, Father.

350
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:26,574
You don't even know what I'm talking about.

351
00:30:26,609 --> 00:30:28,360
It doesn't matter.

352
00:30:28,411 --> 00:30:30,662
I want to help you.

353
00:30:30,696 --> 00:30:32,364
Is there any way I can help?

354
00:30:40,206 --> 00:30:41,623
Yes, there is.

355
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:43,508
Good. I want to.

356
00:30:46,328 --> 00:30:48,546
I'm the Princess Shireen
of House Baratheon.

357
00:30:48,548 --> 00:30:50,849
And I'm your daughter.

358
00:31:05,131 --> 00:31:07,065
Forgive me.

359
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:50,575
Where's my father? I want to see my father.

360
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:53,745
It will all be over soon, Princess.

361
00:31:57,716 --> 00:31:59,167
No.

362
00:32:01,954 --> 00:32:04,005
Where's my father?

363
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:06,524
No, you can't do this.
Father, where are you?

364
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:09,010
Please, let me see my father.

365
00:32:09,044 --> 00:32:11,880
Father, where are you?
Don't let her do this.

366
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:15,600
Please let go!

367
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:18,937
Let me see my father!
Where are you? Please!

368
00:32:18,971 --> 00:32:21,306
- It's what the Lord wants.
- No.

369
00:32:21,357 --> 00:32:24,392
-  Please! Let go! No!
- It's a good thing.

370
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:26,561
- A great thing.
-  Stop. Stop!

371
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:28,480
- Please!
- Hear us now, my Lord.

372
00:32:28,482 --> 00:32:31,282
- You can't do this!
- For you, we offer up this girl

373
00:32:31,317 --> 00:32:34,119
- Please!
-... that you may cleanse her with your fire

374
00:32:34,153 --> 00:32:36,121
and that its light may lead our way.

375
00:32:36,155 --> 00:32:38,156
Please! No, please let me see my father.

376
00:32:38,207 --> 00:32:40,375
If we don't act, we'll all starve here.

377
00:32:40,409 --> 00:32:42,377
All of us.

378
00:32:42,411 --> 00:32:44,078
But if we make this sacrifice...

379
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,331
Accept this token of our faith, my Lord,

380
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:49,217
and lead us from the darkness.

381
00:32:49,251 --> 00:32:52,220
- Lord of Light, show us the way.
- Mother!

382
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:54,389
Mother, please!

383
00:32:56,342 --> 00:32:57,842
Mother, please! Mother!

384
00:32:57,893 --> 00:32:59,978
-  Mother!
- We can't.

385
00:33:00,012 --> 00:33:02,013
- There's no other way. She has king's blood.
- Please don't do this!

386
00:33:02,015 --> 00:33:04,015
Lord of Light, protect us.

387
00:33:04,099 --> 00:33:08,019
- Please! Father, please!
- For the night is dark and full of terrors.

388
00:33:08,103 --> 00:33:09,737
Father!

389
00:33:09,772 --> 00:33:11,773
Father, don't do this! Please!

390
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:15,193
Mother, no! Please! Please, help!

391
00:33:15,195 --> 00:33:17,529
Don't do this!

392
00:33:17,613 --> 00:33:20,248
Please, Father! Mother, help!

393
00:33:20,282 --> 00:33:23,618
- No.
- No, please! Don't do this!

394
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:26,955
Don't do this, please, Mother!

395
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:30,875
Please, Mother! Mother, help!

396
00:33:30,877 --> 00:33:33,928
Mother, help! Help!

397
00:33:33,963 --> 00:33:36,097
Please don't do this, Mother!

398
00:33:36,131 --> 00:33:37,549
Please!

399
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,801
Please, Mother! Please!

400
00:33:39,852 --> 00:33:41,936
Please! No!

401
00:33:41,971 --> 00:33:45,807
Please! No!

402
00:34:02,908 --> 00:34:05,960
No!

403
00:34:55,511 --> 00:34:57,128
Where have you been?

404
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:59,297
Just making sure everything is in order.

405
00:36:29,888 --> 00:36:32,557
They're waiting for you.

406
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:34,559
Clap your hands.

407
00:37:03,923 --> 00:37:05,590
That one, the smaller man.

408
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:07,425
No question, that's where
you should put your money.

409
00:37:07,427 --> 00:37:08,843
The smaller man it is.

410
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:10,762
I'm not putting my money anywhere.

411
00:37:10,813 --> 00:37:12,930
Kings and queens never bet on the games.

412
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:15,266
Perhaps you should go
find someone who does.

413
00:37:15,268 --> 00:37:18,236
People used to bet against
me when I fought in the pits.

414
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:21,272
He would have bet against
me. Common novice mistake.

415
00:37:21,323 --> 00:37:23,357
I've spent much of my life in this arena.

416
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:25,410
And in my experience, large men do triumph

417
00:37:25,444 --> 00:37:27,745
over smaller men far more often than not.

418
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,665
Has your experience ever
involved any actual fighting?

419
00:37:30,699 --> 00:37:32,333
You yourself?

420
00:37:32,367 --> 00:37:35,286
Have you ever tried to kill another
man who was trying to kill you?

421
00:37:37,423 --> 00:37:40,208
Whenever I got into the pit
against a beast like that one,

422
00:37:40,259 --> 00:37:42,927
the crowd saw me, all
skin and bone back then,

423
00:37:42,961 --> 00:37:46,264
then they saw a pile of angry
muscles ready to murder me.

424
00:37:46,298 --> 00:37:48,466
They couldn't get their
money out fast enough.

425
00:37:48,517 --> 00:37:51,969
But the pile of angry muscles
never had any muscles here

426
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:55,389
or... here.

427
00:37:55,441 --> 00:37:57,141
And the big men were always too slow

428
00:37:57,226 --> 00:38:00,061
to stop my dagger from going
where their muscles weren't.

429
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:03,948
Yes, whenever I saw a beast like
that one standing across from me

430
00:38:03,982 --> 00:38:08,069
making his beast faces,
I knew I could rest easy.

431
00:38:19,915 --> 00:38:21,916
You don't approve?

432
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:24,836
There's always been more than enough
death in the world for my taste.

433
00:38:24,887 --> 00:38:26,838
I can do without it in my leisure time.

434
00:38:26,889 --> 00:38:29,340
Fair enough. Yet it's
an unpleasant question,

435
00:38:29,342 --> 00:38:33,761
but what great thing has ever been
accomplished without killing or cruelty?

436
00:38:33,846 --> 00:38:37,098
It's easy to confuse what
is with what ought to be,

437
00:38:37,149 --> 00:38:39,901
especially when what is has
worked out in your favor.

438
00:38:39,935 --> 00:38:41,435
I'm not talking about myself.

439
00:38:41,487 --> 00:38:44,105
I'm talking about the necessary
conditions for greatness.

440
00:38:44,156 --> 00:38:46,073
That is greatness?

441
00:38:46,108 --> 00:38:50,027
That is a vital part of
the great city of Meereen,

442
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:52,530
which existed long before you or I

443
00:38:52,581 --> 00:38:56,667
and will remain standing long
after we have returned to the dirt.

444
00:38:56,702 --> 00:38:58,703
My father would have liked you.

445
00:39:11,049 --> 00:39:13,351
One day your great city will
return to the dirt as well.

446
00:39:13,385 --> 00:39:15,636
- At your command?
- If need be.

447
00:39:20,976 --> 00:39:24,228
And how many people will
die to make this happen?

448
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:27,648
If it comes to that, they will
have died for a good reason.

449
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:29,784
Those men think they're
dying for a good reason.

450
00:39:29,818 --> 00:39:31,569
Someone else's reason.

451
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,955
So your reasons are true
and theirs are false?

452
00:39:33,989 --> 00:39:36,874
They don't know their
own minds, but you do?

453
00:39:36,909 --> 00:39:39,911
Well said. You're an eloquent man.

454
00:39:39,913 --> 00:39:41,629
Doesn't mean you're wrong.

455
00:39:41,663 --> 00:39:43,831
In my experience, eloquent men are right

456
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:45,633
every bit as often as imbeciles.

457
00:40:13,201 --> 00:40:15,580
- Your Grace...
- Shut your mouth.

458
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:44,145
- You can end this.
- She cannot.

459
00:42:44,179 --> 00:42:46,731
You can.

460
00:44:24,279 --> 00:44:26,780
Protect your queen!

461
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:39,093
Go!

462
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:05,202
Your Grace! Your Grace!

463
00:45:05,237 --> 00:45:06,453
Come with me. I know a way out.

464
00:45:06,488 --> 00:45:07,905
I know a way...

465
00:45:43,742 --> 00:45:44,858
Stay close.

466
00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:53,834
This way.

467
00:46:05,213 --> 00:46:06,380
The other side.

468
00:46:06,431 --> 00:46:08,599
Follow me.

469
00:46:10,852 --> 00:46:12,970
Protect your queen!

470
00:49:06,811 --> 00:49:08,645
Drogon!

471
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:12,876
Valahd.
