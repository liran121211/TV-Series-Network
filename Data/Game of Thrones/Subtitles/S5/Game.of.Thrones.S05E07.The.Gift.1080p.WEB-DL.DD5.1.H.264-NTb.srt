1
00:02:59,834 --> 00:03:02,118
First Ranger, you have
command of Castle Black.

2
00:03:02,136 --> 00:03:04,637
Lord Commander,
it is my duty to tell you

3
00:03:04,672 --> 00:03:07,957
I believe this mission
to be reckless, foolhardy,

4
00:03:07,975 --> 00:03:10,009
and an insult to all the brothers

5
00:03:10,094 --> 00:03:13,096
who have died fighting the wildlings.

6
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:16,182
As always, thank you for your honesty.

7
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,440
Safe travels, Lord Commander.

8
00:03:24,474 --> 00:03:26,776
Thank you, Sam.

9
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,828
Oh, um...

10
00:03:34,285 --> 00:03:35,752
It's dragonglass.

11
00:03:35,786 --> 00:03:38,004
It's what I used
to kill the white walker.

12
00:03:43,127 --> 00:03:45,345
I hope you don't need them.

13
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:47,514
Me, too.

14
00:04:02,563 --> 00:04:04,030
Yah.

15
00:04:20,697 --> 00:04:22,365
There he is.

16
00:04:26,503 --> 00:04:28,704
That laugh.

17
00:04:28,756 --> 00:04:31,257
<i>Egg.</i>

18
00:04:31,342 --> 00:04:33,426
<i>Egg laughed like that.</i>

19
00:04:33,477 --> 00:04:37,013
<i>One of the first things I remember.</i>

20
00:04:40,067 --> 00:04:44,070
His little brother Aegon.
He became king.

21
00:04:45,406 --> 00:04:49,826
And before that, he was a jolly fellow,

22
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,727
like this one.

23
00:04:56,367 --> 00:05:00,453
Get him south, Gillyflower.

24
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:04,374
Before it's too late.

25
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:56,759
Theon, wait.

26
00:05:56,793 --> 00:05:59,095
Not Theon, my lady.
Reek.

27
00:05:59,146 --> 00:06:01,064
Help me.

28
00:06:02,349 --> 00:06:04,734
You're his wife now.

29
00:06:04,768 --> 00:06:06,986
Theon.

30
00:06:07,021 --> 00:06:08,354
<i>Do what he says.</i>

31
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:09,856
Do what he says or he'll hurt you.

32
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:12,775
He already hurts me every night.

33
00:06:12,826 --> 00:06:14,143
All day I'm locked in this room

34
00:06:14,161 --> 00:06:16,412
and every night he comes...

35
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:20,450
It can't be any worse.

36
00:06:20,501 --> 00:06:24,420
It can.
It can always be worse.

37
00:06:33,464 --> 00:06:35,098
- What did he do to you?
- Please.

38
00:06:35,132 --> 00:06:37,967
- You betrayed my family!
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

39
00:06:38,018 --> 00:06:40,219
You have to help me.
Theon, help me.

40
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:43,606
He'll see us.
You don't know him.

41
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,191
My family still has
friends in the North.

42
00:06:45,225 --> 00:06:48,444
All I need to do is give a
signal and they'll rescue me.

43
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,064
Climb to the top of the broken tower.

44
00:06:51,115 --> 00:06:53,199
Light this candle
and put it in the window.

45
00:06:53,233 --> 00:06:55,902
- Promise me, Theon.
- Reek! My name is Reek.

46
00:06:58,322 --> 00:07:01,491
Your name is Theon Greyjoy.

47
00:07:02,793 --> 00:07:04,994
Last surviving son of Balon Greyjoy,

48
00:07:05,045 --> 00:07:06,529
Lord of the Iron Islands.

49
00:07:06,547 --> 00:07:08,131
Do you hear me?

50
00:07:11,051 --> 00:07:12,802
Theon...

51
00:07:14,171 --> 00:07:15,755
promise me.

52
00:08:19,153 --> 00:08:21,237
Yes, Reek?

53
00:08:36,753 --> 00:08:38,888
<i>Egg.</i>

54
00:08:38,922 --> 00:08:41,424
Egg.

55
00:08:43,343 --> 00:08:45,895
Mother's looking for you.

56
00:08:47,431 --> 00:08:49,432
Egg.

57
00:08:51,101 --> 00:08:53,936
Get some sleep, Sam.

58
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:56,405
You'll have to speak for him tomorrow.

59
00:08:57,941 --> 00:08:59,492
You don't know that.

60
00:08:59,576 --> 00:09:01,977
Get some sleep.

61
00:09:01,995 --> 00:09:04,664
I'll watch over him.

62
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,418
<i>I'm staying, too.</i>

63
00:09:09,454 --> 00:09:11,370
<i>He's always been good to me.</i>

64
00:09:11,421 --> 00:09:13,539
I can't leave him now.

65
00:09:14,491 --> 00:09:16,825
Egg!

66
00:09:27,888 --> 00:09:29,972
Egg.

67
00:09:31,141 --> 00:09:33,776
I dreamed...

68
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:36,112
that I was old.

69
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:49,625
<i>His name was Aemon Targaryen.</i>

70
00:09:50,878 --> 00:09:52,828
<i>He came to us from King's Landing.</i>

71
00:09:54,998 --> 00:09:58,050
<i>A maester of the Citadel,
chained and sworn,</i>

72
00:09:58,085 --> 00:10:01,754
<i>and sworn brother of the
Night's Watch, ever faithful.</i>

73
00:10:02,923 --> 00:10:05,007
<i>No man was wiser</i>

74
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:08,394
<i>or gentler or kinder.</i>

75
00:10:10,097 --> 00:10:13,015
At the Wall, a dozen lord commanders

76
00:10:13,066 --> 00:10:15,351
came and went during
his years of service,

77
00:10:15,435 --> 00:10:17,687
but he was always there to counsel them.

78
00:10:20,908 --> 00:10:22,692
He was the blood of the dragon...

79
00:10:24,828 --> 00:10:27,196
but now his fire has gone out.

80
00:10:29,499 --> 00:10:31,250
And now his watch is ended.

81
00:10:31,285 --> 00:10:34,203
And now his watch is ended.

82
00:11:02,566 --> 00:11:05,034
You're losing all your friends, Tarly.

83
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:44,407
My beautiful wife.

84
00:11:50,197 --> 00:11:51,864
When my father told me we were marrying,

85
00:11:51,915 --> 00:11:55,117
I half expected a fat, bearded beast.

86
00:11:59,823 --> 00:12:02,625
Do you know how pleased
I was when I saw you?

87
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:05,378
You've made me very happy.

88
00:12:09,966 --> 00:12:13,219
Our scouts report that Stannis
Baratheon rides for Winterfell.

89
00:12:13,303 --> 00:12:16,105
He's a respected commander.

90
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:19,442
His troops are loyal
and battle-tested.

91
00:12:19,476 --> 00:12:23,646
He's hired thousands of foreign
sellswords to bolster his army.

92
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,782
But this storm is a stroke
of luck for us northerners.

93
00:12:28,485 --> 00:12:31,620
Our people are used
to fighting in the frost.

94
00:12:33,073 --> 00:12:36,625
His army is out there now
suffering in the snow.

95
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:39,862
One day I'll be Lord of Winterfell

96
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,131
and Warden of the North.

97
00:12:42,165 --> 00:12:44,500
You'll be my lady and Wardeness.

98
00:12:47,537 --> 00:12:49,805
But isn't your stepmother pregnant?

99
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,591
What of it?

100
00:12:52,642 --> 00:12:54,677
What happens if she has a boy?

101
00:12:56,096 --> 00:12:57,930
Then I'll have a baby brother.

102
00:12:57,981 --> 00:12:59,515
But he'll be the heir.

103
00:12:59,549 --> 00:13:01,851
I'm Lord Bolton's eldest son.

104
00:13:01,902 --> 00:13:03,269
But you're a bastard.

105
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,238
A trueborn will always
have the stronger claim.

106
00:13:09,109 --> 00:13:11,777
I've been naturalized
by a royal decree from...

107
00:13:11,828 --> 00:13:15,081
Tommen Baratheon?
Another bastard.

108
00:13:21,838 --> 00:13:24,924
Bastards can rise high in the world.

109
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:28,043
Like your half-brother
Jon Snow.

110
00:13:29,212 --> 00:13:32,014
Born the bastard of Winterfell,

111
00:13:32,048 --> 00:13:35,050
now the Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

112
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,271
You didn't know?

113
00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:42,308
Yes, he's done very well for himself.

114
00:13:42,359 --> 00:13:44,026
Oh.

115
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,862
I nearly forgot why
I asked you to join me.

116
00:13:46,897 --> 00:13:48,564
Come, my lady.

117
00:13:59,659 --> 00:14:01,744
<i>Your northern friend.</i>

118
00:14:04,831 --> 00:14:07,500
Reek told me you wanted to leave.

119
00:14:07,551 --> 00:14:09,084
Why?

120
00:14:09,136 --> 00:14:10,553
Winterfell is your home

121
00:14:10,587 --> 00:14:13,222
and I am your husband.

122
00:14:13,256 --> 00:14:15,174
<i>Tough old bird.</i>

123
00:14:15,225 --> 00:14:17,643
Everyone talks
when I start peeling them.

124
00:14:17,677 --> 00:14:19,979
<i>But this one,</i>

125
00:14:20,013 --> 00:14:22,815
her heart gave out before
I even got to her face.

126
00:14:25,185 --> 00:14:28,154
We do breed them tough in the North.

127
00:14:34,244 --> 00:14:36,862
Bring my wife back to her chamber.

128
00:14:36,913 --> 00:14:39,331
It's far too cold out here for a lady.

129
00:14:39,366 --> 00:14:42,418
You should hold on to your candles.

130
00:14:42,452 --> 00:14:45,621
<i>The nights are so long now.</i>

131
00:15:35,204 --> 00:15:37,723
<i>40 horses died in the night.</i>

132
00:15:37,757 --> 00:15:40,509
We'll lose more come sunset.

133
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,011
We're running out of food.

134
00:15:42,045 --> 00:15:44,930
We can't open the supply
line until the snow clears.

135
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,186
What else?

136
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:54,356
The Stormcrows rode off last night.

137
00:15:57,577 --> 00:15:59,328
500 men.

138
00:16:02,415 --> 00:16:04,617
Sellswords.

139
00:16:04,668 --> 00:16:07,086
Loyal to nothing but gold.

140
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:13,175
We still have a hard march to Winterfell

141
00:16:13,209 --> 00:16:14,877
and we won't be marching
anywhere in this weather.

142
00:16:14,911 --> 00:16:16,512
And?

143
00:16:16,546 --> 00:16:18,130
This isn't our time.

144
00:16:18,181 --> 00:16:21,634
We should head back to Castle
Black when the snow clears.

145
00:16:21,685 --> 00:16:24,103
I retreated from
King's Landing, Ser Davos.

146
00:16:24,137 --> 00:16:27,606
If I retreat again,
I'll become the King Who Ran.

147
00:16:27,641 --> 00:16:29,725
- Your Grace...
- Winter is coming.

148
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,811
Those aren't just the Stark words.
It's a fact.

149
00:16:32,862 --> 00:16:35,764
If we march back to Castle Black,

150
00:16:35,782 --> 00:16:37,983
we winter at Castle Black.

151
00:16:38,034 --> 00:16:40,202
And who can say how many years

152
00:16:40,236 --> 00:16:41,904
this winter will last?

153
00:16:41,938 --> 00:16:44,073
It's better to wait for the right
time than risk everything.

154
00:16:44,124 --> 00:16:46,375
This is the right time
and I will risk everything.

155
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:49,611
Because if I don't, we've lost.

156
00:16:49,629 --> 00:16:51,747
We march to victory

157
00:16:51,798 --> 00:16:55,668
or we march to defeat.

158
00:16:55,719 --> 00:16:58,253
But we go forward.
Only forward.

159
00:17:08,148 --> 00:17:10,015
Your Grace.

160
00:17:14,604 --> 00:17:17,189
I've trusted in your visions

161
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,275
and your prophecies for years.

162
00:17:20,328 --> 00:17:22,911
You saw it yourself, my king,

163
00:17:22,946 --> 00:17:24,813
when you stared into the flames.

164
00:17:24,864 --> 00:17:26,314
<i>A great battle in the snow.</i>

165
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,584
- I don't know what I saw.
- <i>You do know.</i>

166
00:17:28,618 --> 00:17:29,785
Trust yourself.

167
00:17:29,836 --> 00:17:32,087
And you?
Do you trust yourself?

168
00:17:32,122 --> 00:17:34,423
I trust in the Lord.

169
00:17:36,926 --> 00:17:39,261
Are you sure?

170
00:17:44,634 --> 00:17:48,270
I have seen myself walk along
the battlements of Winterfell.

171
00:17:48,304 --> 00:17:53,275
I have seen the flayed man
banners lowered to the ground.

172
00:18:01,785 --> 00:18:05,654
But sometimes sacrifices must
be made to ensure victory.

173
00:18:07,323 --> 00:18:10,859
I have shown you
the power of king's blood.

174
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,327
The usurper Robb Stark.

175
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,713
The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.

176
00:18:14,748 --> 00:18:17,199
We don't have Robert's bastard here.

177
00:18:17,217 --> 00:18:20,836
No, we have someone better.

178
00:18:22,088 --> 00:18:24,723
And your blood runs through her veins.

179
00:18:26,259 --> 00:18:28,227
Have you lost your mind?

180
00:18:28,261 --> 00:18:29,928
Do you doubt me?

181
00:18:29,979 --> 00:18:32,398
Still?

182
00:18:32,432 --> 00:18:34,049
After all that you've seen.

183
00:18:34,067 --> 00:18:35,901
There must be another way.

184
00:18:35,935 --> 00:18:38,553
- Leeches or...
- There is only one way.

185
00:18:38,571 --> 00:18:42,441
You must become king
before the Long Night begins.

186
00:18:42,492 --> 00:18:44,693
Only you can lead
the living against the dead.

187
00:18:44,727 --> 00:18:47,996
All your life has led us to this moment.

188
00:18:48,031 --> 00:18:50,449
- To this decision.
- She's my daughter.

189
00:18:52,869 --> 00:18:55,037
Get out.

190
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,694
There's always some sort of grub on.

191
00:19:18,728 --> 00:19:20,946
A bit of mutton would be nice.

192
00:19:23,983 --> 00:19:28,320
A beauty from beyond the Wall.

193
00:19:28,371 --> 00:19:30,873
Where you going, love?
Aren't we better-looking than the fat man?

194
00:19:30,907 --> 00:19:34,109
No, the question is
is she pretty down south in the real world

195
00:19:34,127 --> 00:19:36,111
or is she pretty
'cause she's the only girl here?

196
00:19:36,129 --> 00:19:38,369
Even in White Harbor, I'd want a kiss.

197
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:41,560
- Come on, love, give us a kiss.
- Leave me alone.

198
00:19:41,579 --> 00:19:43,879
Oh, if you were my girl,
I wouldn't leave you alone.

199
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,637
- One little kiss.
- Come on, give him a kiss.

200
00:19:45,672 --> 00:19:48,006
A man gets lonely guarding the Wall.

201
00:19:52,178 --> 00:19:53,896
There's no need to be rude.

202
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:56,064
We just want a little affection.

203
00:19:56,099 --> 00:19:58,567
Ooh.

204
00:19:59,903 --> 00:20:01,904
Get your hands off her.

205
00:20:01,939 --> 00:20:04,790
Brother Derek, Brother Brant,

206
00:20:04,824 --> 00:20:06,725
I believe you both
have guard duty tonight.

207
00:20:06,793 --> 00:20:08,277
Sam the Slayer.

208
00:20:08,329 --> 00:20:09,945
You gonna slay me with that sword?

209
00:20:09,979 --> 00:20:11,446
<i>Look at his hand shake.</i>

210
00:20:11,498 --> 00:20:13,599
Gilly, go on.

211
00:20:13,633 --> 00:20:15,868
Get back to your room, lock the door.

212
00:20:18,872 --> 00:20:20,923
- I'm warning you.
- Come on.

213
00:20:20,957 --> 00:20:22,791
Come on.

214
00:20:26,212 --> 00:20:27,846
Sam!

215
00:20:27,964 --> 00:20:30,382
You lying sack of shit.

216
00:20:30,433 --> 00:20:32,217
<i>Killed a white walker, eh?</i>

217
00:20:32,268 --> 00:20:34,720
You fat-ass fuck.

218
00:20:34,771 --> 00:20:36,171
Come on, get up.

219
00:20:36,222 --> 00:20:39,274
<i>- No!</i>
- This your hero? This hog?

220
00:20:39,309 --> 00:20:42,144
Leave him alone!

221
00:20:42,178 --> 00:20:44,863
Stubborn little wildling
bitch, aren't you?

222
00:20:46,699 --> 00:20:48,984
- Come on!
- No!

223
00:20:49,018 --> 00:20:52,154
- Sam! Sam! Sam!
- Come on!

224
00:21:00,997 --> 00:21:03,215
- Sam! Sam!
- Come on.

225
00:21:03,249 --> 00:21:05,033
<i>Right.</i>

226
00:21:05,051 --> 00:21:07,970
<i>I'll deal with this.</i>

227
00:21:09,538 --> 00:21:11,640
<i>- Turn her over.</i>
- All right.

228
00:21:13,593 --> 00:21:16,845
I said get your hands off her.

229
00:21:16,879 --> 00:21:18,513
You're gonna get yourself killed.

230
00:21:18,547 --> 00:21:21,016
Your lover Jon Snow's
not here to save you.

231
00:21:21,067 --> 00:21:23,735
I killed a white walker,
I killed a Thenn.

232
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,572
I'll take my chances with you.

233
00:21:42,856 --> 00:21:44,182
Sam!

234
00:21:46,409 --> 00:21:48,710
- I'm all right.
- You're not.

235
00:21:48,744 --> 00:21:51,346
Just a bit woozy.

236
00:22:15,604 --> 00:22:18,606
The next time you see something
like that, you leave it alone.

237
00:22:18,658 --> 00:22:21,627
<i>I will not.
They would have...</i>

238
00:22:24,514 --> 00:22:26,682
I don't know what they would have done.

239
00:22:26,716 --> 00:22:29,217
I know they would have killed
you if Ghost hadn't come.

240
00:22:29,252 --> 00:22:32,554
No. No, no.
They were tiring out.

241
00:22:32,589 --> 00:22:35,340
I had them in the palm of my hand.

242
00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:38,593
Don't be stupid, Sam.

243
00:22:38,627 --> 00:22:41,346
You're not a fighter.

244
00:22:41,397 --> 00:22:42,964
What kind of man would I be

245
00:22:42,982 --> 00:22:45,684
if I ran away when I saw
someone hurting you?

246
00:22:45,735 --> 00:22:48,403
Just promise me

247
00:22:48,438 --> 00:22:51,023
whatever happens, you'll
take care of Little Sam.

248
00:22:51,074 --> 00:22:52,974
But of course I will.

249
00:22:52,992 --> 00:22:55,510
And...

250
00:22:55,545 --> 00:22:58,063
I'll take care of you, too.

251
00:23:04,253 --> 00:23:06,204
I need more water.

252
00:23:09,776 --> 00:23:11,993
Stay.

253
00:23:12,011 --> 00:23:14,162
<i>Please?</i>

254
00:24:14,157 --> 00:24:15,774
Am I hurting you?

255
00:24:19,662 --> 00:24:21,246
Are you sure?

256
00:24:50,476 --> 00:24:52,944
Oh, my!

257
00:25:10,546 --> 00:25:12,964
<i>A rare find for the
fighting pits, my friends.</i>

258
00:25:12,999 --> 00:25:17,169
Not your usual street tough
or drunken pirate.

259
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:20,505
This one's a Westerosi knight

260
00:25:20,556 --> 00:25:24,843
from an ancient house
trained in sword and lance.

261
00:25:24,894 --> 00:25:27,345
He fought beside the stag king Robert

262
00:25:27,396 --> 00:25:29,147
on the far side of the Narrow Sea.

263
00:25:29,182 --> 00:25:32,517
<i>He was first through the breach
during the Siege of Spike,</i>

264
00:25:32,568 --> 00:25:35,904
slaughtering 50 men
with his flaming sword.

265
00:25:35,938 --> 00:25:40,108
He killed the great Khal
Drogo in single combat.

266
00:25:40,142 --> 00:25:42,444
Betrayed by his woman,

267
00:25:42,478 --> 00:25:45,831
he sold himself into slavery
to repay his debts.

268
00:25:45,865 --> 00:25:49,984
<i>Bidding begins at 12 gold honors.</i>

269
00:25:50,002 --> 00:25:53,338
13.
Do I have 14?

270
00:25:53,372 --> 00:25:57,492
15?
15 gold honors.

271
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:00,762
Do I hear 16?
16?

272
00:26:00,796 --> 00:26:02,714
20.

273
00:26:02,765 --> 00:26:04,266
Sold.

274
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:16,511
Wait! You have
to buy me as well.

275
00:26:16,529 --> 00:26:17,979
Why?

276
00:26:18,898 --> 00:26:20,699
We're a team.

277
00:26:20,733 --> 00:26:22,200
I'm a great fighter, too.

278
00:26:25,404 --> 00:26:28,240
He's funny.
You have to give him that.

279
00:26:55,184 --> 00:26:58,270
You're right, he's funny.

280
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:06,912
Thank you, my lord.
Thank you.

281
00:27:06,946 --> 00:27:08,496
Yes.

282
00:27:08,531 --> 00:27:10,498
My lord, if I may.

283
00:27:10,533 --> 00:27:12,951
I've heard Meereen
has become a free city.

284
00:27:13,002 --> 00:27:15,870
You might run into trouble if you try
to fight slaves in the fighting pits.

285
00:27:15,904 --> 00:27:18,540
Now, if you were to fight freed
men who'd be paid a wage...

286
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:23,411
There's your wages, funny man.

287
00:27:23,429 --> 00:27:26,097
Should last the rest of your life.

288
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:30,685
These are warrior hands,
not a serving girl's.

289
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,520
5, going once...

290
00:27:36,592 --> 00:27:39,945
How long before the King of
Meereen comes to claim my pillow?

291
00:27:39,979 --> 00:27:41,896
Don't be ridiculous.

292
00:27:41,948 --> 00:27:45,700
My marriage to Hizdahr is political.

293
00:27:45,735 --> 00:27:48,286
I think he's smart enough
to understand that.

294
00:27:49,739 --> 00:27:51,939
I think the Sons of the
Harpy have stopped killing

295
00:27:51,958 --> 00:27:54,326
because their leader was made king.

296
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:59,414
Are you jealous?

297
00:27:59,465 --> 00:28:01,783
You think I'm petty enough
to speak ill of a man

298
00:28:01,801 --> 00:28:04,502
just because he represents competition?

299
00:28:04,553 --> 00:28:06,287
I do.

300
00:28:08,057 --> 00:28:09,891
You're right.

301
00:28:09,925 --> 00:28:12,844
My motivations are entirely impure.

302
00:28:21,437 --> 00:28:23,438
Doesn't make me wrong.

303
00:28:27,643 --> 00:28:31,997
You told me yourself I can't fight
enemies within and without.

304
00:28:32,081 --> 00:28:34,449
So when enemies without come knocking,

305
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,618
I need the city of Meereen behind me.

306
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:39,170
I have no choice.

307
00:28:39,255 --> 00:28:40,872
Everyone has a choice.

308
00:28:40,923 --> 00:28:42,624
Even slaves have a choice...

309
00:28:42,658 --> 00:28:44,209
Death or slavery.

310
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:47,295
So what else can I do, hmm?

311
00:28:49,015 --> 00:28:51,132
Marry me instead.

312
00:28:52,551 --> 00:28:57,055
Even if I wanted to do
such an inadvisable thing,

313
00:28:57,106 --> 00:28:58,673
I couldn't.

314
00:28:58,691 --> 00:29:00,475
Why not?

315
00:29:00,509 --> 00:29:02,527
You are queen.
You can do what you like.

316
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:08,116
No, I can't.

317
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:11,286
Then you are the only person
in Meereen who's not free.

318
00:29:22,081 --> 00:29:26,718
And I know I'm here to serve
my queen and not give advice,

319
00:29:26,752 --> 00:29:29,254
but can I make one more suggestion?

320
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:35,143
Of course.

321
00:29:37,446 --> 00:29:40,231
On the day of the great games,

322
00:29:40,266 --> 00:29:43,118
gather all the Great
Masters and Wise Masters

323
00:29:43,152 --> 00:29:46,287
and Worthy Masters you can find

324
00:29:46,322 --> 00:29:48,289
and slaughter them all.

325
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:55,397
I am a queen, not a butcher.

326
00:29:59,752 --> 00:30:03,338
All rulers are either butchers or meat.

327
00:30:11,781 --> 00:30:15,350
You there. Where would
I find the High Septon

328
00:30:15,384 --> 00:30:18,803
or High Sparrow or whatever
bloody fool name he's got?

329
00:30:18,854 --> 00:30:22,724
It's not as good a name as
Queen of Thorns, I'll admit.

330
00:30:24,143 --> 00:30:25,944
You should have the decency

331
00:30:25,978 --> 00:30:28,530
to stand when you speak to a lady.

332
00:30:28,565 --> 00:30:31,282
You should have the decency
to kneel before the gods.

333
00:30:31,317 --> 00:30:32,851
Don't spar with me, little fellow.

334
00:30:35,789 --> 00:30:38,940
For me, it's the knees.

335
00:30:38,958 --> 00:30:40,875
- You?
- Hips.

336
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:43,128
Ah.

337
00:30:43,162 --> 00:30:46,915
A man of the people.
Is that your game?

338
00:30:46,949 --> 00:30:50,718
It's an old game.
Dull and unconvincing.

339
00:30:50,753 --> 00:30:52,887
A man of the people

340
00:30:52,922 --> 00:30:55,673
who does Cersei's dirty work for her.

341
00:30:56,926 --> 00:30:58,626
The people always do the dirty work.

342
00:30:58,644 --> 00:31:01,763
Spare me the homilies. I can
smell a fraud from a mile away.

343
00:31:01,814 --> 00:31:03,231
Useful talent.

344
00:31:03,265 --> 00:31:06,100
I'm here for my grandson
and granddaughter.

345
00:31:06,134 --> 00:31:08,520
Your grandson and granddaughter

346
00:31:08,571 --> 00:31:11,823
swore sacred vows and lied.

347
00:31:11,907 --> 00:31:14,325
The Father judges us all.

348
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,828
Sons of high lords,

349
00:31:16,862 --> 00:31:18,880
sons of fishermen.

350
00:31:18,914 --> 00:31:22,367
If you break his laws,
you will be punished.

351
00:31:23,369 --> 00:31:24,819
Don't you walk away from me.

352
00:31:24,837 --> 00:31:27,038
You don't give commands
here, Lady Olenna.

353
00:31:27,089 --> 00:31:28,506
What is it you want?

354
00:31:28,541 --> 00:31:30,592
Gold?

355
00:31:30,626 --> 00:31:33,595
I'll make you the richest
septon who ever lived.

356
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:37,565
What, then?

357
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,518
I imagine this is strange for you.

358
00:31:40,553 --> 00:31:43,021
Everyone you meet has a hidden motive

359
00:31:43,055 --> 00:31:46,357
and you pride yourself
on sniffing it out.

360
00:31:46,392 --> 00:31:48,843
<i>But I'm telling you a simple truth.</i>

361
00:31:48,861 --> 00:31:51,229
I serve the gods.

362
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,231
The gods demand justice.

363
00:31:53,282 --> 00:31:55,567
How do they communicate their demands?

364
00:31:55,618 --> 00:31:57,485
By raven or horse?

365
00:31:57,536 --> 00:32:00,421
By the holy text,
"The Seven-Pointed Star."

366
00:32:00,456 --> 00:32:02,957
If you don't have one in your library,

367
00:32:02,992 --> 00:32:04,242
<i>I'll give you my own.</i>

368
00:32:04,293 --> 00:32:06,794
I've read
"The Seven-Pointed Star."

369
00:32:06,829 --> 00:32:11,165
<i>Then you'll remember the passages
concerning buggery and perjury.</i>

370
00:32:11,199 --> 00:32:13,301
Your grandchildren will be punished

371
00:32:13,335 --> 00:32:18,239
in the same manner as anyone
who breaks the sacred laws.

372
00:32:18,274 --> 00:32:19,707
Half the men, women, and children

373
00:32:19,725 --> 00:32:23,378
in this foul city break the sacred laws.

374
00:32:23,412 --> 00:32:26,497
You live among murderers,
thieves, and rapists,

375
00:32:26,532 --> 00:32:28,566
and yet you punish Loras

376
00:32:28,601 --> 00:32:32,103
for shagging some perfumed ponce

377
00:32:32,154 --> 00:32:34,155
and Margaery for defending her brother?

378
00:32:34,189 --> 00:32:38,760
Yes. The gods' laws must
be applied to all equally.

379
00:32:38,794 --> 00:32:41,512
If it's equality you want, so be it.

380
00:32:41,547 --> 00:32:45,567
When House Tyrell stops sending
our crops to the capital,

381
00:32:45,601 --> 00:32:47,669
everyone here will starve.

382
00:32:47,703 --> 00:32:50,905
And I'll make sure the
hungry know who's to blame.

383
00:32:53,742 --> 00:32:56,878
Have you ever sowed the field,
Lady Olenna?

384
00:32:58,964 --> 00:33:02,016
Have you ever reaped the grain?

385
00:33:02,051 --> 00:33:03,968
Has anyone in House Tyrell?

386
00:33:05,187 --> 00:33:06,921
A lifetime of wealth and power

387
00:33:06,939 --> 00:33:08,973
has left you blind in one eye.

388
00:33:10,893 --> 00:33:14,979
You are the few, we are the many.

389
00:33:16,565 --> 00:33:20,234
And when the many
stop fearing the few...

390
00:33:34,383 --> 00:33:37,085
Lady Olenna.

391
00:33:47,896 --> 00:33:49,814
<i>Starving yourself won't make things</i>

392
00:33:49,849 --> 00:33:52,266
<i>any better for her, my love.</i>

393
00:33:54,687 --> 00:33:56,738
She's in a prison cell

394
00:33:56,773 --> 00:33:59,907
and there is nothing I can do.

395
00:34:03,112 --> 00:34:04,912
I am the king!

396
00:34:04,947 --> 00:34:08,166
The queen is in prison and
there is nothing I can do!

397
00:34:22,431 --> 00:34:25,967
No matter who you are,

398
00:34:26,001 --> 00:34:28,019
no matter how strong
you are, sooner or later,

399
00:34:28,053 --> 00:34:30,655
you'll face circumstances
beyond your control.

400
00:34:30,689 --> 00:34:33,691
Events you couldn't
possibly have anticipated

401
00:34:33,726 --> 00:34:35,393
or prevented even if you had.

402
00:34:35,477 --> 00:34:38,446
You cannot blame yourself for fate.

403
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,182
Your father,

404
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,867
your brother, your grandfather...

405
00:34:42,901 --> 00:34:46,037
I was Queen of the Seven
Kingdoms and what could I do?

406
00:34:46,071 --> 00:34:48,823
Hold them as they left this world.

407
00:34:48,857 --> 00:34:50,708
Kissed their heads after they'd gone.

408
00:34:50,744 --> 00:34:52,860
I'll call in the army.

409
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:55,246
I'll take back the sept

410
00:34:55,297 --> 00:34:58,800
and kill every last one of them.

411
00:35:00,552 --> 00:35:03,171
I'll start a war if I have to.

412
00:35:03,205 --> 00:35:06,758
You know as well as I do
who the first casualty of that war would be.

413
00:35:11,379 --> 00:35:13,514
I love her.

414
00:35:16,435 --> 00:35:18,820
I love her...

415
00:35:20,889 --> 00:35:22,740
and I can't help her.

416
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:40,174
We must be strong for those we love.

417
00:35:40,209 --> 00:35:42,543
We cannot give in to despair.

418
00:35:42,577 --> 00:35:45,513
I will speak with the High Sparrow.

419
00:35:45,547 --> 00:35:47,048
There must be something he...

420
00:35:47,082 --> 00:35:49,350
Let me talk to him on your behalf.

421
00:35:49,384 --> 00:35:53,304
The king cannot sully himself
negotiating with an unwashed fanatic.

422
00:35:54,723 --> 00:35:56,657
You will try to help her?

423
00:35:56,692 --> 00:36:00,111
I'll do everything I can
to win her freedom and her brother's.

424
00:36:00,145 --> 00:36:03,231
Your happiness
is all I want in this world.

425
00:36:04,399 --> 00:36:07,235
- I know.
- No, you don't.

426
00:36:10,772 --> 00:36:12,623
You can't possibly.

427
00:36:14,343 --> 00:36:17,345
Not until you have children of your own.

428
00:36:17,379 --> 00:36:20,081
I would do anything for you.

429
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,951
Anything to keep you from harm.

430
00:36:26,255 --> 00:36:28,473
I would burn cities to the ground.

431
00:36:30,225 --> 00:36:33,561
You are all that matters.

432
00:36:33,595 --> 00:36:37,648
You and your sister.

433
00:36:37,683 --> 00:36:40,568
From the moment you came
into this world.

434
00:36:40,602 --> 00:36:43,104
My boy.

435
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,525
My only boy.

436
00:37:02,508 --> 00:37:04,125
Prince Doran hopes this satisfies

437
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:07,011
your concerns about the
princess's well-being.

438
00:37:13,886 --> 00:37:16,103
You looked different when I left.

439
00:37:16,138 --> 00:37:18,272
You had more hair.

440
00:37:18,307 --> 00:37:21,309
And more hands.

441
00:37:21,343 --> 00:37:23,945
- How's Trystane?
- He'll be all right.

442
00:37:23,979 --> 00:37:25,146
I'm sorry for that.

443
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,781
It wasn't supposed to happen that way.

444
00:37:26,815 --> 00:37:28,733
Why is it happening at all?

445
00:37:30,035 --> 00:37:32,620
Your mother's worried about you.

446
00:37:32,654 --> 00:37:34,906
Threats have been made.

447
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:36,374
Dorne's too dangerous for you.

448
00:37:36,408 --> 00:37:38,910
- I've come to take you home.
- This is my home.

449
00:37:38,961 --> 00:37:40,461
This has been my home for years.

450
00:37:40,495 --> 00:37:42,863
I didn't want to come here,
but she told me to.

451
00:37:42,881 --> 00:37:44,131
I did what she said.

452
00:37:44,166 --> 00:37:46,884
I did my duty and now
she's forcing me to go back?

453
00:37:46,919 --> 00:37:49,720
It's for your own good.
These are complicated matters.

454
00:37:49,755 --> 00:37:52,223
<i>No, it's not complicated at all.
It's simple.</i>

455
00:37:52,257 --> 00:37:54,759
I love Trystane, I'm going to marry him,

456
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:56,260
and we're staying right here.

457
00:37:56,311 --> 00:37:58,145
- I don't understand.
- Of course you don't.

458
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:00,264
You don't know me.

459
00:38:34,249 --> 00:38:37,218
He's got a good voice.

460
00:38:37,252 --> 00:38:39,053
We're lucky he's a singer.

461
00:38:39,087 --> 00:38:41,555
If he were a fighter, we
might have been in trouble.

462
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:44,659
It's against my code to hurt a woman.

463
00:38:44,693 --> 00:38:47,812
It's amazing how many men we
beat seem to have this code.

464
00:38:47,863 --> 00:38:49,563
I wouldn't say you beat me.

465
00:38:49,598 --> 00:38:51,315
How's your arm?

466
00:38:51,383 --> 00:38:53,150
Wonderful.

467
00:38:53,201 --> 00:38:56,237
Wouldn't feel right to leave
Dorne without a new scar.

468
00:38:56,288 --> 00:38:58,472
You think you're leaving Dorne?

469
00:38:58,507 --> 00:39:00,541
No great hurry.

470
00:39:00,575 --> 00:39:03,411
Dornish women are the most
beautiful women in the world.

471
00:39:03,445 --> 00:39:04,662
Thank you.

472
00:39:04,713 --> 00:39:07,999
I said Dornish women.
I didn't say you.

473
00:39:10,285 --> 00:39:13,220
I'm not the most beautiful
woman you've ever seen?

474
00:39:14,456 --> 00:39:16,007
<i>I've seen quite a few women</i>

475
00:39:16,058 --> 00:39:17,591
<i>in all the Seven Kingdoms.</i>

476
00:39:17,625 --> 00:39:21,145
Name one more beautiful than I am.

477
00:39:22,848 --> 00:39:26,133
Well, now, in King's Landing,

478
00:39:26,151 --> 00:39:29,770
<i>there was an absolutely gorgeous...</i>

479
00:39:33,992 --> 00:39:35,526
There was a what?

480
00:39:37,913 --> 00:39:40,865
<i>In King's Landing, you were saying?</i>

481
00:39:40,916 --> 00:39:42,950
Was I?

482
00:39:42,984 --> 00:39:46,003
There was a woman
more beautiful than I am.

483
00:39:46,038 --> 00:39:47,955
Was there?

484
00:39:47,989 --> 00:39:50,174
My memory's not what it was earlier.

485
00:39:53,595 --> 00:39:55,046
How's your arm now?

486
00:39:55,097 --> 00:39:56,847
You seem concerned with it.

487
00:39:56,882 --> 00:39:58,883
<i>You must really like me.</i>

488
00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:10,561
And how about your head?

489
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:17,234
<i>My head?</i>

490
00:40:17,285 --> 00:40:19,487
My head?

491
00:40:19,521 --> 00:40:22,373
You don't even want to
know what's going on in...

492
00:40:32,667 --> 00:40:34,668
Your nose is bleeding.

493
00:40:37,472 --> 00:40:40,341
It's nothing.
It's the dry air.

494
00:40:43,395 --> 00:40:47,898
My dagger was coated with a
special ointment from Asshai.

495
00:40:47,933 --> 00:40:50,651
<i>They call it the Long Farewell.</i>

496
00:40:50,685 --> 00:40:52,719
It takes time to work,

497
00:40:52,771 --> 00:40:56,857
but if a single drop
makes contact with the skin,

498
00:40:56,891 --> 00:40:58,109
death.

499
00:41:06,284 --> 00:41:08,669
The only antidote.

500
00:41:13,241 --> 00:41:15,926
Who's the most beautiful
woman in the world?

501
00:41:17,078 --> 00:41:18,679
You.

502
00:41:19,781 --> 00:41:22,466
Sorry? Who?

503
00:41:24,269 --> 00:41:26,937
You.

504
00:41:26,972 --> 00:41:28,889
Don't drop it.

505
00:41:42,821 --> 00:41:45,573
I think you're very handsome as well.

506
00:42:30,202 --> 00:42:33,154
- I'm sorry about the locale.
- No, you're not.

507
00:42:35,423 --> 00:42:37,508
It felt like the safest place.

508
00:42:37,542 --> 00:42:39,793
Not for your clientele, clearly.

509
00:42:41,012 --> 00:42:43,264
It was an establishment like no other.

510
00:42:44,466 --> 00:42:46,467
The sheer range of appetites catered to.

511
00:42:46,501 --> 00:42:48,269
Desires that didn't even exist

512
00:42:48,303 --> 00:42:51,172
until we invented them.

513
00:42:51,206 --> 00:42:54,525
You've always been rather impressed
with yourself, haven't you?

514
00:42:55,777 --> 00:42:58,512
The past is the past.

515
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:02,032
The future is all
that's worth discussing.

516
00:43:03,685 --> 00:43:05,219
The future of House Tyrell.

517
00:43:05,253 --> 00:43:08,038
Don't pretend to have
any concern for my house,

518
00:43:08,073 --> 00:43:09,690
my grandchildren or me.

519
00:43:09,708 --> 00:43:12,459
I should have known
you'd return to the capital

520
00:43:12,494 --> 00:43:14,628
as soon as things started to go wrong.

521
00:43:14,663 --> 00:43:17,081
- I promise you...
- I promise you, Lord Baelish,

522
00:43:17,165 --> 00:43:19,250
that our fates are joined.

523
00:43:19,301 --> 00:43:21,252
Together we murdered a king.

524
00:43:21,303 --> 00:43:24,755
If my house should fall,
I will have nothing to hide.

525
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:29,260
And if I should meet with some accident

526
00:43:29,311 --> 00:43:32,479
here at your broken little flesh market,

527
00:43:32,514 --> 00:43:35,849
they'll never even find
what's left of you.

528
00:43:35,883 --> 00:43:38,419
So...

529
00:43:38,453 --> 00:43:40,487
do you deny a part in all this?

530
00:43:40,522 --> 00:43:43,857
Cersei summoned me to King's Landing.

531
00:43:43,891 --> 00:43:45,326
I dared not refuse her.

532
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,111
And what did she want?

533
00:43:47,162 --> 00:43:50,397
<i>A piece of information
she knew that I had.</i>

534
00:43:50,415 --> 00:43:53,934
Neither silence nor lies were an option.

535
00:43:53,969 --> 00:43:56,453
But I have other information

536
00:43:56,538 --> 00:43:58,339
of which she is unaware.

537
00:43:59,758 --> 00:44:02,626
And as you say,
our interests are aligned.

538
00:44:04,596 --> 00:44:06,380
I have a gift for you.

539
00:44:06,414 --> 00:44:08,098
What kind of gift?

540
00:44:08,133 --> 00:44:11,352
The same kind I gave Cersei.

541
00:44:11,386 --> 00:44:13,437
A handsome young man.

542
00:44:27,152 --> 00:44:29,737
<i>Many worthy fighters have died</i>

543
00:44:29,788 --> 00:44:32,373
<i>trying to make it to the great games.</i>

544
00:44:32,407 --> 00:44:35,492
When most of you worthless scum
join them in death this afternoon,

545
00:44:35,543 --> 00:44:38,662
it will represent a significant
rise in your station.

546
00:44:38,713 --> 00:44:41,548
But if you do happen to triumph here,

547
00:44:41,583 --> 00:44:44,468
<i>you will fight at the Great
Pit of Daznak itself</i>

548
00:44:44,502 --> 00:44:46,170
<i>in front of the queen.</i>

549
00:44:46,221 --> 00:44:50,591
So whatever happens, the gods
have smiled upon you today.

550
00:44:50,642 --> 00:44:54,895
This is the day your lives
actually start to mean something.

551
00:44:57,015 --> 00:44:59,683
You and you.
You.

552
00:45:00,935 --> 00:45:02,936
You two.

553
00:45:05,106 --> 00:45:06,690
<i>You, you, and you.</i>

554
00:45:07,575 --> 00:45:09,443
Up.

555
00:45:09,494 --> 00:45:12,479
<i>- Valar morghulis.
- Valar dohaeris.</i>

556
00:45:12,498 --> 00:45:14,665
Prepare yourselves.

557
00:45:26,461 --> 00:45:29,329
Sitting through the great
games will be bad enough.

558
00:45:29,347 --> 00:45:32,499
For generations in the days
leading up to the great games,

559
00:45:32,517 --> 00:45:34,018
it has been customary for our ruler

560
00:45:34,052 --> 00:45:35,853
to make the rounds of the lower pits

561
00:45:35,887 --> 00:45:38,472
to pay the fighters there
the honor of her presence.

562
00:45:41,893 --> 00:45:45,479
Move yourselves.

563
00:45:51,403 --> 00:45:53,037
Your Grace.

564
00:45:53,071 --> 00:45:54,655
Your future Grace.

565
00:45:54,689 --> 00:45:56,907
You honor us all.

566
00:45:59,193 --> 00:46:01,495
Stand there.

567
00:46:01,529 --> 00:46:04,331
Stand straight.
That's the fucking queen.

568
00:46:05,834 --> 00:46:07,835
We fight and die for your glory,

569
00:46:07,869 --> 00:46:09,837
O glorious queen.

570
00:46:12,257 --> 00:46:14,541
We fight and die for your glory,

571
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:16,477
<i>O glorious queen.</i>

572
00:46:17,929 --> 00:46:20,647
<i>Fight!</i>

573
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:20,106
I think I've seen enough.

574
00:47:20,125 --> 00:47:23,076
Your Grace, it is a tradition

575
00:47:23,128 --> 00:47:26,330
for the queen to stay
until the victor has emerged.

576
00:47:26,381 --> 00:47:28,461
I've sacrificed more than
enough for your traditions.

577
00:47:33,454 --> 00:47:35,088
What are you doing?

578
00:47:43,982 --> 00:47:45,662
Wait your turn,
you piece of fucking filth.

579
00:49:15,406 --> 00:49:17,274
Get him out of my sight.

580
00:49:17,325 --> 00:49:19,559
Khaleesi, please.

581
00:49:19,577 --> 00:49:22,029
I just need a moment of your time.

582
00:49:22,063 --> 00:49:23,864
I brought you a gift.

583
00:49:24,749 --> 00:49:26,667
<i>It's true.</i>

584
00:49:27,902 --> 00:49:30,370
He has.

585
00:49:30,404 --> 00:49:32,205
Who are you?

586
00:49:33,424 --> 00:49:35,626
I am the gift.

587
00:49:37,078 --> 00:49:40,264
<i>It's a pleasure to meet you, Your Grace.</i>

588
00:49:41,382 --> 00:49:43,383
My name is Tyrion Lannister.

589
00:50:16,484 --> 00:50:18,352
<i>This is horrible.</i>

590
00:50:18,386 --> 00:50:20,420
Unacceptable.

591
00:50:21,973 --> 00:50:24,424
Are they feeding you enough at least?

592
00:50:25,593 --> 00:50:28,729
I brought you this.
Venison.

593
00:50:28,763 --> 00:50:31,064
It's quite good.

594
00:50:33,768 --> 00:50:36,987
I had it myself for supper
only last night.

595
00:50:40,742 --> 00:50:43,877
We did everything we could from the
moment they took your brother.

596
00:50:43,911 --> 00:50:46,146
<i>Tommen even went to the sept himself</i>

597
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:48,682
<i>to confront the High Sparrow.</i>

598
00:50:48,716 --> 00:50:51,585
But I fear the Faith
has left reason behind.

599
00:50:51,619 --> 00:50:54,671
I know you did this.

600
00:50:54,706 --> 00:50:58,525
We are making every effort
on your behalf.

601
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:01,161
I swear to you by all the seven gods.

602
00:51:01,195 --> 00:51:03,230
Lies come easily to you.

603
00:51:03,264 --> 00:51:04,731
Everyone knows that.

604
00:51:04,766 --> 00:51:07,651
<i>But innocence,</i>

605
00:51:07,685 --> 00:51:10,270
<i>decency, concern,</i>

606
00:51:10,304 --> 00:51:13,223
you're not very good
at those, I'm afraid.

607
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:16,843
Perhaps that's why your son was so eager

608
00:51:16,894 --> 00:51:18,945
to cast you aside for me.

609
00:51:20,948 --> 00:51:23,116
You're upset.

610
00:51:23,151 --> 00:51:25,318
You're not thinking clearly.

611
00:51:25,353 --> 00:51:27,688
I'll visit again when you've
had a chance to calm down.

612
00:51:27,722 --> 00:51:29,756
I don't want to see you again.

613
00:51:29,824 --> 00:51:32,225
<i>I do hope you change
your mind about that.</i>

614
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:34,795
I've been told men often go mad

615
00:51:34,862 --> 00:51:37,297
in the Black Cells beneath the Red Keep.

616
00:51:37,331 --> 00:51:39,132
<i>Though I suppose your isolation will end</i>

617
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,318
when your trial begins.

618
00:51:42,787 --> 00:51:44,521
Leave.

619
00:51:44,555 --> 00:51:46,506
Yes.

620
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:48,024
I'm afraid I must.

621
00:51:48,059 --> 00:51:50,043
<i>My son needs me now more than ever.</i>

622
00:51:50,061 --> 00:51:52,929
Get out, you hateful bitch!

623
00:52:06,861 --> 00:52:08,945
Sleep well, sister.

624
00:52:36,474 --> 00:52:38,058
Thank you, Boake.

625
00:52:45,149 --> 00:52:46,733
- You saw her?
- Yes.

626
00:52:46,767 --> 00:52:49,602
- And?
- Her accommodations seem sufficient.

627
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:51,938
What happens to her now?

628
00:52:51,956 --> 00:52:54,407
Well, she and her brother
are both being held

629
00:52:54,441 --> 00:52:56,159
under fair suspicion.

630
00:52:56,210 --> 00:52:58,829
A trial will be held for each of them

631
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,715
to determine if they're
guilty of any acts

632
00:53:01,749 --> 00:53:05,502
that might constitute a violation
of the tenets of the faith.

633
00:53:05,553 --> 00:53:07,420
Who will stand judge?

634
00:53:07,454 --> 00:53:11,675
Seven septons as it was in all
trials before the Targaryens.

635
00:53:12,844 --> 00:53:14,127
Will you be one of them?

636
00:53:14,178 --> 00:53:15,595
I will.

637
00:53:17,815 --> 00:53:19,966
If one or both of them

638
00:53:19,984 --> 00:53:22,736
were to confess before the trial...

639
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:24,654
Then they will be shown
the Mother's mercy.

640
00:53:25,973 --> 00:53:28,408
And what does the Mother's mercy entail?

641
00:53:28,442 --> 00:53:30,660
It depends upon the situation.

642
00:53:30,695 --> 00:53:33,663
The acts themselves,
the degree of contrition.

643
00:53:33,698 --> 00:53:36,449
Thank you, High Septon,

644
00:53:36,483 --> 00:53:39,452
for bringing them whatever
justice they deserve

645
00:53:39,504 --> 00:53:42,355
<i>in the eyes of the Seven.</i>

646
00:53:46,327 --> 00:53:47,844
<i>Did you know this chapel</i>

647
00:53:47,879 --> 00:53:50,797
is one of the oldest
structures in King's Landing?

648
00:53:52,133 --> 00:53:54,667
I think I may have heard at one point.

649
00:53:54,685 --> 00:53:57,470
Baelor built his sept around it.

650
00:53:59,006 --> 00:54:02,025
But men worshipped here long before him.

651
00:54:02,059 --> 00:54:04,844
Who carved this altar?

652
00:54:04,862 --> 00:54:08,315
- Do you know?
- I'm afraid I don't.

653
00:54:08,399 --> 00:54:10,734
No one does.

654
00:54:10,785 --> 00:54:14,371
There's no name on it or
anywhere else in the chapel.

655
00:54:16,324 --> 00:54:18,875
No, the people who built this place

656
00:54:18,910 --> 00:54:22,913
didn't inflict their vanity
on those who came after them

657
00:54:22,964 --> 00:54:26,699
the way Baelor did with that great
gilded monstrosity up there.

658
00:54:26,717 --> 00:54:28,534
Hmm.

659
00:54:28,553 --> 00:54:30,670
Their faith was clean.

660
00:54:31,923 --> 00:54:34,707
Strip away the gold and the ornaments,

661
00:54:34,725 --> 00:54:38,511
knock down the statues and the pillars,

662
00:54:38,545 --> 00:54:40,647
and this is what remains.

663
00:54:43,601 --> 00:54:46,236
Something simple...

664
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,909
and solid and true.

665
00:54:57,198 --> 00:55:00,500
The Tyrells' finery
will be stripped away.

666
00:55:01,669 --> 00:55:03,420
<i>Their lies knocked down.</i>

667
00:55:03,454 --> 00:55:06,590
<i>Their true hearts
laid bare for all to see.</i>

668
00:55:07,875 --> 00:55:10,743
And so it will be for all of us.

669
00:55:10,761 --> 00:55:13,380
High and low alike.

670
00:55:17,418 --> 00:55:19,585
What will we find

671
00:55:19,604 --> 00:55:22,606
when we strip away your finery?

672
00:55:25,776 --> 00:55:29,396
<i>A young man came to us not long ago.</i>

673
00:55:29,447 --> 00:55:32,315
Broken in body and spirit.

674
00:55:34,201 --> 00:55:36,870
He had so much to strip away.

675
00:55:38,572 --> 00:55:42,242
<i>So much weighing him down.</i>

676
00:55:42,293 --> 00:55:45,545
<i>But piece by piece,
he unburdened himself.</i>

677
00:55:46,964 --> 00:55:48,965
<i>Let go of vanity,</i>

678
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,584
pride, sin.

679
00:55:54,138 --> 00:55:56,556
Now his soul is so light,

680
00:55:56,590 --> 00:55:59,843
he will float
through the Seven Heavens like a bird.

681
00:55:59,927 --> 00:56:01,594
Hmm.

682
00:56:06,651 --> 00:56:09,152
And he has much to say about you.

683
00:56:33,494 --> 00:56:35,211
Move.

684
00:56:37,014 --> 00:56:39,766
Let me go immediately.

685
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,835
You will order her to let me go.

686
00:56:42,853 --> 00:56:45,522
I am the queen!
I am the queen!

687
00:56:45,557 --> 00:56:47,273
Have you lost your mind?

688
00:56:47,308 --> 00:56:48,808
Let me go!

689
00:56:50,111 --> 00:56:52,479
<i>Get your filthy hands off me!</i>

690
00:56:52,530 --> 00:56:54,847
<i>Have you lost your mind?</i>

691
00:56:54,865 --> 00:56:57,784
<i>I am the queen!
Let me go!</i>

692
00:57:03,908 --> 00:57:05,959
Look at me.

693
00:57:08,162 --> 00:57:09,963
Look at my face.

694
00:57:12,633 --> 00:57:15,969
It's the last thing
you'll see before you die.
