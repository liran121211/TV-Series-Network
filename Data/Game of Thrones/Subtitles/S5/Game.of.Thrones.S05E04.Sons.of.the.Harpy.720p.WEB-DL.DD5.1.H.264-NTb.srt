1
00:03:12,823 --> 00:03:15,108
Is that Estermont?

2
00:03:15,192 --> 00:03:17,560
Tarth, Ser Jaime.

3
00:03:19,351 --> 00:03:21,731
The Sapphire Isle.

4
00:03:25,483 --> 00:03:27,350
Why are we on a merchant ship?

5
00:03:27,401 --> 00:03:29,185
Why no Lannister sails?

6
00:03:31,856 --> 00:03:33,823
This ship's sailing to Oldtown.

7
00:03:33,858 --> 00:03:36,493
We'll get off earlier
not far from Sunspear,

8
00:03:36,527 --> 00:03:38,995
row ourselves to the Dornish
shore in the night.

9
00:03:40,364 --> 00:03:42,031
You ever been to Dorne?

10
00:03:42,033 --> 00:03:44,000
- No.
- I have.

11
00:03:44,034 --> 00:03:45,752
The Dornish are crazy.

12
00:03:45,786 --> 00:03:48,838
All they want to do is fight
and fuck, fuck and fight.

13
00:03:48,873 --> 00:03:50,840
You should be happy to go back.

14
00:03:52,092 --> 00:03:53,710
There's nothing
like a good fight

15
00:03:53,761 --> 00:03:56,045
to get you in the mood
for fucking.

16
00:03:56,096 --> 00:03:58,348
And there's nothing like
a fuck-mad Dornish girl

17
00:03:58,382 --> 00:04:00,550
to clear your head
for the next fight.

18
00:04:00,552 --> 00:04:02,769
It's how the two work together.

19
00:04:02,803 --> 00:04:04,971
Now we're gonna be doing
a lot of fighting, I'm sure.

20
00:04:05,055 --> 00:04:06,556
Well, I am.

21
00:04:06,607 --> 00:04:09,359
But I don't imagine we'll get
to stick around for the rest.

22
00:04:09,393 --> 00:04:11,394
Not after we've kidnapped
their princess.

23
00:04:11,445 --> 00:04:13,446
We're not kidnapping
their princess.

24
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,566
We're rescuing my niece,
bringing her back to her family.

25
00:04:16,568 --> 00:04:17,867
Your niece?

26
00:04:25,993 --> 00:04:28,328
I've been doing this sort
of thing a long time.

27
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:30,380
- I'm good at it.
- That's why you're here.

28
00:04:30,414 --> 00:04:32,665
I know.
Why are you here?

29
00:04:32,716 --> 00:04:34,918
Why not send 40 of me?
Or an army?

30
00:04:34,969 --> 00:04:37,470
Unlike most folks,
you've actually got one.

31
00:04:37,555 --> 00:04:40,340
Because I don't want
to start a war.

32
00:04:40,391 --> 00:04:43,726
That still doesn't explain
what you're doing here.

33
00:04:46,597 --> 00:04:47,897
It has to be me.

34
00:04:50,901 --> 00:04:53,820
If I'm putting something
like this together,

35
00:04:53,854 --> 00:04:55,855
a one-handed man
who happens to be

36
00:04:55,906 --> 00:04:58,608
one of the most recognizable
faces in Westeros is not--

37
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,493
It has to be me.

38
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,784
You set your brother
free, didn't you?

39
00:05:10,087 --> 00:05:12,288
I'll bet your sister
didn't like that.

40
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,925
Varys set him free.

41
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:24,884
Well, if you ever see
the wee fucker,

42
00:05:24,935 --> 00:05:26,552
give him my regards.

43
00:05:30,524 --> 00:05:32,642
He murdered my father.

44
00:05:35,312 --> 00:05:38,364
If I ever see him,
I'll split him in two.

45
00:05:39,483 --> 00:05:41,818
And then I'll give
him your regards.

46
00:05:47,675 --> 00:05:52,662
The Iron Bank has called in
one-tenth of the crown's debts.

47
00:05:52,664 --> 00:05:55,465
Given the expense of
rebuilding the royal fleet--

48
00:05:55,499 --> 00:05:56,799
How much can the crown afford?

49
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:58,401
<i>With winter coming,</i>

50
00:05:58,435 --> 00:06:01,838
half what they ask, less?

51
00:06:01,872 --> 00:06:05,141
You're the Master of Coin.
How do we pay them?

52
00:06:05,175 --> 00:06:07,176
House Tyrell could
front the gold

53
00:06:07,227 --> 00:06:09,312
and the crown would
pay us back in time

54
00:06:09,346 --> 00:06:12,015
or I'd have words
with my daughter.

55
00:06:17,187 --> 00:06:19,856
You've already
given us too much.

56
00:06:19,907 --> 00:06:23,860
No, we must arrange better
terms with the Iron Bank.

57
00:06:23,862 --> 00:06:26,529
- Absolutely.
- In person.

58
00:06:28,165 --> 00:06:31,200
- Me? - We must send an envoy
to the Iron Bank,

59
00:06:31,235 --> 00:06:34,871
someone of importance to show
these bankers our respect.

60
00:06:34,873 --> 00:06:37,874
As the king's Master of Coin, I can
think of no one more qualified.

61
00:06:37,925 --> 00:06:40,009
I would be honored, Your Grace.

62
00:06:40,044 --> 00:06:43,963
The king's expressed concern about his
father-in-law's safety on this voyage.

63
00:06:47,267 --> 00:06:51,554
He's ordered Ser Meryn to
personally lead your escort.

64
00:06:53,223 --> 00:06:55,308
My very own Kingsguard?

65
00:06:55,392 --> 00:06:57,393
- Please express my--
- Safe travels, Lord Tyrell.

66
00:06:57,444 --> 00:06:59,395
Of course.
Of course.

67
00:06:59,397 --> 00:07:03,316
I'll give your regards
to the Titan of Braavos.

68
00:07:12,126 --> 00:07:15,461
The small council grows
smaller and smaller.

69
00:07:15,546 --> 00:07:17,830
Not small enough.

70
00:07:28,008 --> 00:07:31,094
May I offer you
some wine, Your Holiness?

71
00:07:31,096 --> 00:07:33,062
No.

72
00:07:36,316 --> 00:07:39,102
The old High Septon would
have asked the vintage.

73
00:07:39,153 --> 00:07:42,188
I could say that our minds
are temples to the Seven

74
00:07:42,239 --> 00:07:44,774
and should be kept pure.

75
00:07:44,776 --> 00:07:47,994
But the truth is
I don't like the taste.

76
00:07:48,078 --> 00:07:50,163
Hmm.

77
00:07:50,197 --> 00:07:52,615
How may I serve?

78
00:07:54,001 --> 00:07:57,453
All over Westeros we hear
of septs being burned,

79
00:07:57,455 --> 00:08:00,640
Silent Sisters raped,

80
00:08:00,674 --> 00:08:03,292
bodies of holy men
piled in the streets.

81
00:08:03,294 --> 00:08:06,846
Wars teach people to obey
the sword, not the gods.

82
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,849
Perhaps the gods
need a sword of their own.

83
00:08:09,883 --> 00:08:11,868
<i>In the days before
the Targaryens,</i>

84
00:08:11,902 --> 00:08:15,304
the Faith Militant dispensed
the justice of the Seven.

85
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:19,826
Well, the Faith Militant was disarmed
more than two centuries ago.

86
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:23,396
If I explain their holy
purpose to my son the king,

87
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,565
I have no doubt
he will sign a decree

88
00:08:25,616 --> 00:08:27,733
arming the believers
you felt worthy.

89
00:08:27,785 --> 00:08:32,355
An army that defends the bodies
and souls of the common people?

90
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:35,324
An army in service
to the gods themselves.

91
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,326
And to you, of course,

92
00:08:37,377 --> 00:08:39,712
as the chosen representative
of the Seven.

93
00:08:39,797 --> 00:08:42,331
An honor I never expected.

94
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:44,217
Or, indeed, ever wished for.

95
00:08:44,251 --> 00:08:46,251
Which is why you were chosen.

96
00:08:47,971 --> 00:08:50,423
You and I both know
how the world works.

97
00:08:50,474 --> 00:08:52,658
Too often the wicked
are the wealthiest,

98
00:08:52,693 --> 00:08:54,494
beyond the reach of justice.

99
00:08:54,528 --> 00:08:58,264
The king himself cannot always
punish those who deserve it most.

100
00:08:58,315 --> 00:09:01,484
All sinners are equal
before the gods.

101
00:09:05,439 --> 00:09:10,109
What would you say if I told you of
a great sinner in our very midst?

102
00:09:10,194 --> 00:09:13,095
Shielded by gold and privilege.

103
00:09:15,065 --> 00:09:17,700
May the Father judge him justly.

104
00:09:49,566 --> 00:09:52,652
What are you doing?

105
00:09:56,156 --> 00:09:58,541
Help me!
Help me!

106
00:10:04,915 --> 00:10:07,750
Yeah. Yeah.

107
00:10:07,801 --> 00:10:10,303
Get off me!

108
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,928
Come on.

109
00:10:18,979 --> 00:10:21,480
Shut up!
Move!

110
00:10:28,689 --> 00:10:31,073
This is Lord Petyr
Baelish's establishment.

111
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,204
<i>Cocksuckers.</i>

112
00:10:45,255 --> 00:10:47,623
<i>Boy fucker.</i>

113
00:10:47,674 --> 00:10:50,626
<i>You buggering filth!</i>

114
00:10:50,628 --> 00:10:54,046
There's a special place in the
seventh hell for your kind.

115
00:10:54,097 --> 00:10:56,766
Please.
Please, I'll pay.

116
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,801
I'll-- I'll pay
all of you.

117
00:10:58,852 --> 00:11:00,970
Yes, you will.

118
00:11:36,673 --> 00:11:38,007
Seize him.

119
00:11:38,009 --> 00:11:39,675
Sinner.

120
00:11:39,677 --> 00:11:40,926
Get your hands off me.

121
00:11:40,978 --> 00:11:42,511
Ser Loras of House Tyrell,

122
00:11:42,513 --> 00:11:44,647
you have broken the laws
of gods and men.

123
00:11:45,816 --> 00:11:47,816
Who do you think you are?

124
00:11:48,485 --> 00:11:50,319
Justice.

125
00:11:56,576 --> 00:11:59,078
Why is my brother in a cell?

126
00:11:59,112 --> 00:12:01,664
I-I don't know.

127
00:12:01,698 --> 00:12:03,416
I-I didn't order it.

128
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,701
We both know who did.

129
00:12:05,703 --> 00:12:09,789
You told me she was
returning to Casterly Rock.

130
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,174
Are you saying
my mother's behind this?

131
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:14,677
She's jealous
you're not hers anymore.

132
00:12:14,711 --> 00:12:17,546
<i>Arresting my brother
is her revenge.</i>

133
00:12:17,631 --> 00:12:19,715
Aren't you and Mother
getting along?

134
00:12:25,389 --> 00:12:29,191
Oh, my sweet, sweet king.

135
00:12:30,694 --> 00:12:34,254
Do you have any affection
for me at all?

136
00:12:35,449 --> 00:12:37,533
Of course I do.

137
00:12:37,567 --> 00:12:39,402
You're my queen.

138
00:12:39,486 --> 00:12:41,821
I can't bear
to think of my brother

139
00:12:41,872 --> 00:12:44,623
locked away in some grimy cell.

140
00:12:46,576 --> 00:12:49,045
I'll set him free for you.

141
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:50,629
Do you promise?

142
00:12:57,421 --> 00:13:00,056
I demand that
Ser Loras be freed now.

143
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:01,974
Did I arrest him?

144
00:13:03,343 --> 00:13:05,761
Well, no.

145
00:13:05,763 --> 00:13:08,147
But y-you armed
the Faith Militant.

146
00:13:08,181 --> 00:13:11,734
You gave the High Sparrow
an army.

147
00:13:11,768 --> 00:13:14,019
I did.

148
00:13:14,071 --> 00:13:18,107
And your wife has
every right to criticize.

149
00:13:18,158 --> 00:13:20,860
We can't allow fanatics
to arrest the queen's brother

150
00:13:20,911 --> 00:13:23,496
no matter his perversions.

151
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:25,364
Then...

152
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:29,452
can I tell Margaery you'll
have Ser Loras released?

153
00:13:29,503 --> 00:13:32,171
I told you,
I'm not holding Ser Loras.

154
00:13:32,255 --> 00:13:34,173
You're the king.

155
00:13:34,207 --> 00:13:35,958
I'm sure if you speak
to the High Sparrow,

156
00:13:36,009 --> 00:13:38,511
he'll release the poor boy.

157
00:13:43,266 --> 00:13:45,301
Halt!

158
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:11,243
His Holiness is praying.
He will not be disturbed.

159
00:14:12,829 --> 00:14:16,132
Give the order and we'll
clear out this rabble.

160
00:14:17,551 --> 00:14:20,386
You mean, kill them?

161
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,221
Here at the sept?

162
00:14:22,255 --> 00:14:25,416
You'd be sending them to meet
the gods that they love.

163
00:14:28,645 --> 00:14:30,513
<i>Bastard!</i>

164
00:14:30,515 --> 00:14:32,731
<i>You're an abomination!</i>

165
00:14:37,687 --> 00:14:40,022
<i>Born of sin!</i>

166
00:14:40,073 --> 00:14:42,324
<i>Filthy bastard!</i>

167
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:49,248
We'll find another way.

168
00:14:51,368 --> 00:14:53,035
<i>Abomination!</i>

169
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,709
My queen?

170
00:15:05,715 --> 00:15:08,217
There was no way to free Ser
Loras without violence.

171
00:15:11,471 --> 00:15:13,889
You're the King of the Andals,

172
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,608
the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,

173
00:15:15,642 --> 00:15:17,860
<i>the Protector of the Realm,</i>

174
00:15:17,894 --> 00:15:21,230
<i>and you let a band of fanatics
imprison your brother by law.</i>

175
00:15:22,732 --> 00:15:24,233
I'm going to speak
with the High Sparrow.

176
00:15:24,284 --> 00:15:26,318
Are you?
When?

177
00:15:27,737 --> 00:15:30,289
- I-I don't know.
- You don't know?

178
00:15:30,323 --> 00:15:32,875
He was praying just now.

179
00:15:35,795 --> 00:15:37,796
I have to send word
to Grandmother.

180
00:15:38,915 --> 00:15:41,133
Will you come back later?

181
00:15:42,752 --> 00:15:45,471
I need to be with
my family, Your Grace.

182
00:15:46,723 --> 00:15:48,557
Of course.

183
00:15:51,428 --> 00:15:53,095
You think
highly of this boy?

184
00:15:53,146 --> 00:15:54,647
Good.

185
00:15:54,681 --> 00:15:56,649
Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

186
00:15:56,683 --> 00:15:59,435
And a bastard
by some tavern slut.

187
00:15:59,437 --> 00:16:02,797
Perhaps, but that
wasn't Ned Stark's way.

188
00:16:06,076 --> 00:16:08,277
I should have given you a son.

189
00:16:09,996 --> 00:16:11,614
Not your fault.

190
00:16:11,616 --> 00:16:13,582
Whose, then?

191
00:16:13,617 --> 00:16:16,118
I gave you nothing but weakness.

192
00:16:18,955 --> 00:16:20,539
And deformity.

193
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:24,510
Those scars mean nothing
to the Lord of Light.

194
00:16:24,594 --> 00:16:26,512
My lady.

195
00:16:26,546 --> 00:16:29,298
Her father is the Lord's
chosen king,

196
00:16:29,349 --> 00:16:32,051
and her father's blood
runs through her veins.

197
00:16:40,894 --> 00:16:43,362
You march on Winterfell soon?

198
00:16:43,396 --> 00:16:46,782
We must to beat the snows.

199
00:16:48,068 --> 00:16:50,369
Once before, you put
your faith in Ser Davos

200
00:16:50,403 --> 00:16:52,538
and left me behind.

201
00:16:54,874 --> 00:16:57,042
I hope you won't make
that mistake again.

202
00:16:57,077 --> 00:16:58,794
I won't.

203
00:17:01,164 --> 00:17:02,831
I need you.

204
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,501
You only need faith, my king.

205
00:17:09,923 --> 00:17:12,007
And you, my lady,
what do you need?

206
00:17:13,677 --> 00:17:16,562
To serve my Lord.

207
00:17:20,567 --> 00:17:22,901
Lord Ashford.

208
00:17:27,624 --> 00:17:30,376
Lady Caulfield.

209
00:17:31,578 --> 00:17:34,580
Oh, Lord Smallwood.

210
00:17:34,631 --> 00:17:36,465
I've never even heard
of these people.

211
00:17:36,499 --> 00:17:39,051
They haven't heard
of you, either.

212
00:17:39,085 --> 00:17:41,503
But we need men
and they have some.

213
00:17:43,723 --> 00:17:46,642
How many men does this
Lord Mayzen have to send us?

214
00:17:46,676 --> 00:17:49,061
More than Lord Wibberley.

215
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:04,777
<i>- Not him.
-  I know, I'm sorry.</i>

216
00:18:04,828 --> 00:18:07,162
But we need men and supplies

217
00:18:07,197 --> 00:18:08,697
and Roose Bolton's
the Warden of the North.

218
00:18:08,699 --> 00:18:10,082
He murdered my brother.

219
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:13,369
We swore to be
the watchers on the Wall.

220
00:18:13,453 --> 00:18:16,872
We can't watch the Wall
with 50 men.

221
00:18:16,923 --> 00:18:18,707
And we can't get more men

222
00:18:18,709 --> 00:18:21,043
without help from
the Warden of the North.

223
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,118
Apologies, my lady.

224
00:18:57,831 --> 00:18:59,698
Lord Commander.

225
00:18:59,733 --> 00:19:02,117
How can I help you?

226
00:19:02,152 --> 00:19:04,420
<i>Come with us when we ride south.</i>

227
00:19:04,422 --> 00:19:07,723
None of us know the
castle as well as you do.

228
00:19:07,757 --> 00:19:10,175
Its hidden tunnels,
its weaknesses,

229
00:19:10,226 --> 00:19:12,861
its people.

230
00:19:12,896 --> 00:19:15,180
Winterfell was your home once.

231
00:19:16,483 --> 00:19:19,184
Don't you want to chase
the rats out of it?

232
00:19:21,604 --> 00:19:24,239
Castle Black is my home now.

233
00:19:24,274 --> 00:19:27,876
<i>The Night's Watch take no part in
the wars of the Seven Kingdoms.</i>

234
00:19:27,911 --> 00:19:29,945
There's only one war.

235
00:19:29,979 --> 00:19:32,247
Life against death.

236
00:19:33,983 --> 00:19:37,419
Come, let me show you
what you're fighting for.

237
00:19:37,454 --> 00:19:40,038
You're gonna show me
some vision in the fire?

238
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:43,542
Forgive me, my lady,
I don't trust in visions.

239
00:19:44,844 --> 00:19:48,430
No visions.
No magic.

240
00:19:48,465 --> 00:19:50,466
Just life.

241
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,905
Do you feel my heart beating?

242
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:17,159
There's power in you.

243
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:20,129
You resist it,
and that's your mistake.

244
00:20:20,163 --> 00:20:21,997
Embrace it.

245
00:20:31,841 --> 00:20:35,844
The Lord of Light
made us male and female.

246
00:20:35,895 --> 00:20:38,514
Two parts of a greater whole.

247
00:20:39,682 --> 00:20:43,268
In our joining, there's power.

248
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:45,821
Power to make life,

249
00:20:45,855 --> 00:20:48,190
power to make light,

250
00:20:48,241 --> 00:20:51,109
and power to cast shadows.

251
00:20:51,161 --> 00:20:54,196
I don't think Stannis
would like that very much.

252
00:20:55,248 --> 00:20:57,533
Then we shouldn't tell him.

253
00:20:58,535 --> 00:21:01,036
- I can't.
- Why?

254
00:21:01,955 --> 00:21:04,373
I swore a vow.

255
00:21:05,675 --> 00:21:08,010
I loved another.

256
00:21:08,044 --> 00:21:10,295
The dead don't need lovers.

257
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,598
Only the living.

258
00:21:17,053 --> 00:21:19,888
I know.

259
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:21,974
But I still love her.

260
00:21:36,623 --> 00:21:39,074
You know nothing, Jon Snow.

261
00:22:16,446 --> 00:22:17,863
Are you lonely?

262
00:22:19,415 --> 00:22:20,916
Just bored.

263
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,584
My father used
to tell me that boredom

264
00:22:22,619 --> 00:22:24,253
indicates a lack
of inner resources.

265
00:22:24,287 --> 00:22:25,921
Were you bored a lot, too?

266
00:22:25,955 --> 00:22:28,523
I know Castle Black

267
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:29,958
is no place
for a child, but--

268
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,595
I like it. I thought
I'd be left at home.

269
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:36,265
I know Mother
didn't want to bring me.

270
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:38,350
Why do you say that?

271
00:22:39,552 --> 00:22:42,137
She told me, "I don't
want to bring you."

272
00:22:43,806 --> 00:22:45,886
She shouldn't have said that.

273
00:22:55,568 --> 00:22:57,736
Are you ashamed of me, Father?

274
00:23:08,998 --> 00:23:11,633
When you were an infant,

275
00:23:11,668 --> 00:23:15,137
a Dornish trader
landed on Dragonstone.

276
00:23:15,171 --> 00:23:18,507
His goods were junk
except for one wooden doll.

277
00:23:20,259 --> 00:23:23,578
He had even sewn a dress on it
in the colors of our house.

278
00:23:25,231 --> 00:23:27,599
No doubt he had
heard of your birth

279
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:30,852
and assumed new fathers
were easy targets.

280
00:23:34,407 --> 00:23:37,887
I still remember how you smiled when
I put that doll in your cradle.

281
00:23:39,195 --> 00:23:41,613
How you pressed it
to your cheek.

282
00:23:48,538 --> 00:23:51,338
By the time we burned the
doll, it was too late.

283
00:23:53,793 --> 00:23:55,961
I was told you would die.

284
00:23:56,012 --> 00:23:59,014
Or worse,

285
00:23:59,048 --> 00:24:00,882
the greyscale would go slow.

286
00:24:00,933 --> 00:24:04,052
<i>Let you grow just enough
to know the world</i>

287
00:24:04,103 --> 00:24:06,355
<i>before taking it away from you.</i>

288
00:24:06,389 --> 00:24:09,057
Everyone advised me to send
you to the ruins of Valyria

289
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:11,143
to live out your short life
with the Stone Men

290
00:24:11,194 --> 00:24:14,196
<i>before the sickness
spread through the castle.</i>

291
00:24:15,565 --> 00:24:18,233
I told them all to go to hell.

292
00:24:19,819 --> 00:24:22,704
<i>I called in every maester
on this side of the world.</i>

293
00:24:22,739 --> 00:24:25,907
Every healer.
Every apothecary.

294
00:24:27,994 --> 00:24:30,235
They stopped the disease
and saved your life.

295
00:24:31,414 --> 00:24:33,215
'Cause you did not belong
across the world

296
00:24:33,249 --> 00:24:35,967
with the bloody Stone Men.

297
00:24:36,002 --> 00:24:39,042
You are the Princess Shireen
of House Baratheon.

298
00:24:41,474 --> 00:24:43,341
And you are my daughter.

299
00:25:44,687 --> 00:25:47,022
<i>I thought
I might find you here.</i>

300
00:25:49,575 --> 00:25:51,526
<i>Your Aunt Lyanna.</i>

301
00:25:51,528 --> 00:25:54,496
Father never talked about her.

302
00:25:56,082 --> 00:25:59,084
Sometimes I'd find him down
here lighting the candles.

303
00:26:00,453 --> 00:26:02,087
They say she was beautiful.

304
00:26:02,121 --> 00:26:04,456
I saw her once.

305
00:26:04,507 --> 00:26:07,592
I was a boy living
with your mother's family.

306
00:26:07,627 --> 00:26:11,296
Lord Whent held a great
tourney at Harrenhal.

307
00:26:11,347 --> 00:26:13,381
Everyone was there.

308
00:26:13,432 --> 00:26:16,885
The Mad King, your father,

309
00:26:16,969 --> 00:26:18,470
Robert Baratheon,

310
00:26:18,521 --> 00:26:20,388
and Lyanna.

311
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:23,275
She was already
promised to Robert.

312
00:26:23,309 --> 00:26:25,143
You can imagine
what it was like for me,

313
00:26:25,194 --> 00:26:28,730
a boy from nowhere
with nothing to his name,

314
00:26:28,732 --> 00:26:30,532
watching these legendary men

315
00:26:30,566 --> 00:26:33,451
tilting at the lists.

316
00:26:33,486 --> 00:26:36,371
The last two riders
were Barristan Selmy

317
00:26:36,405 --> 00:26:38,406
and Rhaegar Targaryen.

318
00:26:38,457 --> 00:26:42,244
When Rhaegar won, everyone
cheered for their prince.

319
00:26:42,295 --> 00:26:44,246
I remember the girls laughing
when he took off his helmet

320
00:26:44,248 --> 00:26:46,248
and they saw that silver hair.

321
00:26:46,332 --> 00:26:48,667
How handsome he was.

322
00:26:48,718 --> 00:26:51,503
Until he rode
right past his wife,

323
00:26:51,587 --> 00:26:53,555
Elia Martell,

324
00:26:53,589 --> 00:26:55,507
and all the smiles died.

325
00:26:56,842 --> 00:26:59,144
I've never seen
so many people so quiet.

326
00:27:00,263 --> 00:27:03,598
He rode past his wife

327
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,602
and he lay a crown of winter
roses in Lyanna's lap.

328
00:27:07,604 --> 00:27:09,738
Blue as frost.

329
00:27:12,942 --> 00:27:15,160
How many tens of
thousands had to die

330
00:27:15,244 --> 00:27:17,525
because Rhaegar chose your aunt?

331
00:27:19,532 --> 00:27:22,534
Yes, he chose her.

332
00:27:22,618 --> 00:27:25,120
And then he kidnapped
her and raped her.

333
00:27:33,045 --> 00:27:35,130
Come.

334
00:27:35,132 --> 00:27:37,599
Let's speak somewhere
the dead can't hear us.

335
00:27:42,638 --> 00:27:44,439
You're dressed for riding.

336
00:27:44,473 --> 00:27:46,942
I am.

337
00:27:46,976 --> 00:27:48,893
Where are you going?

338
00:27:48,978 --> 00:27:50,895
King's Landing.

339
00:27:50,947 --> 00:27:52,781
King's Landing?

340
00:27:52,815 --> 00:27:54,649
Cersei sent for me.

341
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,402
We mustn't let her
sniff out any trouble.

342
00:27:57,486 --> 00:27:59,070
You can't leave me here.

343
00:27:59,121 --> 00:28:01,656
I know how hard it is to live
with people you despise.

344
00:28:01,707 --> 00:28:03,375
Believe me.

345
00:28:03,409 --> 00:28:05,377
But it won't be for long.

346
00:28:05,411 --> 00:28:06,745
How do you know?

347
00:28:08,247 --> 00:28:11,499
Stannis Baratheon
garrisons at Castle Black.

348
00:28:11,501 --> 00:28:13,969
He'll march south
to King's Landing

349
00:28:14,003 --> 00:28:15,971
before the winter snows
block his way.

350
00:28:16,005 --> 00:28:18,974
But first he has
to take Winterfell.

351
00:28:19,008 --> 00:28:21,509
- You don't know that.
- I do.

352
00:28:23,012 --> 00:28:24,896
Once he liberates these
lands from the Boltons,

353
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:27,432
he'll rally your father's
bannermen to his cause.

354
00:28:27,483 --> 00:28:29,401
With the North behind him,

355
00:28:29,435 --> 00:28:31,936
Stannis can finally take
the Iron Throne.

356
00:28:32,021 --> 00:28:34,739
You think he'll
defeat the Boltons?

357
00:28:34,774 --> 00:28:36,491
He has a larger army.

358
00:28:36,525 --> 00:28:39,077
He's the finest military
commander in Westeros.

359
00:28:39,111 --> 00:28:42,664
A betting man would put
his money on Stannis.

360
00:28:42,698 --> 00:28:45,200
As it happens,
I am a betting man.

361
00:28:46,702 --> 00:28:48,453
And if you're right?

362
00:28:48,504 --> 00:28:50,372
Stannis takes Winterfell,

363
00:28:50,423 --> 00:28:53,383
he rescues you from the most
despised family in the North.

364
00:28:53,426 --> 00:28:56,761
Grateful for your late father's
courageous support of his claim,

365
00:28:56,796 --> 00:28:59,381
he names you
Wardeness of the North.

366
00:28:59,383 --> 00:29:01,716
But I--

367
00:29:01,718 --> 00:29:03,385
I wouldn't--

368
00:29:03,436 --> 00:29:04,936
Wardeness of the North?

369
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:07,856
You are the last
surviving Stark.

370
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:09,607
He needs you.

371
00:29:09,642 --> 00:29:10,892
And what if you're wrong?

372
00:29:10,943 --> 00:29:12,644
What if Stannis never
attacks Winterfell?

373
00:29:12,695 --> 00:29:15,363
Or he does and the
Boltons defeat him?

374
00:29:15,398 --> 00:29:17,565
Then you will take
this Bolton boy, Ramsay,

375
00:29:17,567 --> 00:29:19,317
and make him yours.

376
00:29:19,368 --> 00:29:21,202
I don't know how to do that.

377
00:29:21,237 --> 00:29:23,038
Of course you do.

378
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,873
He's already fallen for you.

379
00:29:24,907 --> 00:29:26,908
His father frightens me.

380
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:30,412
He should.
He's a dangerous man.

381
00:29:30,463 --> 00:29:34,132
But even the most dangerous
men can be outmaneuvered.

382
00:29:34,166 --> 00:29:37,287
And you've learned to
maneuver from the very best.

383
00:29:39,171 --> 00:29:41,673
I'll return before too long.

384
00:29:41,724 --> 00:29:44,592
You'll be strong without me.

385
00:29:52,184 --> 00:29:54,319
The North will be yours.

386
00:29:55,705 --> 00:29:57,822
Do you believe me?

387
00:29:59,492 --> 00:30:03,027
I expect I'll be a married
woman by the time you return.

388
00:31:06,842 --> 00:31:08,510
Breakfast.

389
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:14,399
That would have been
a shit way to die.

390
00:31:14,433 --> 00:31:17,519
As far as I've seen, they're
all shit ways to die.

391
00:31:17,521 --> 00:31:20,939
Aye, but your lot have to give
the singers a good ending.

392
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:23,608
I don't care what's sung
about me when I'm dead.

393
00:31:23,659 --> 00:31:25,743
No?

394
00:31:25,778 --> 00:31:28,496
Two knights off
to rescue a princess.

395
00:31:28,531 --> 00:31:30,365
Sounds like a good song to me.

396
00:31:30,416 --> 00:31:32,750
Sounds like all the rest.

397
00:31:35,454 --> 00:31:37,372
What about you?

398
00:31:37,423 --> 00:31:39,841
What shit way would you choose?

399
00:31:41,093 --> 00:31:44,128
In my own keep
drinking my own wine

400
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,500
watching my sons
grovel for my fortune.

401
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:49,884
How disappointing.

402
00:31:49,935 --> 00:31:53,104
I thought you'd have something
more exciting planned.

403
00:31:53,138 --> 00:31:55,390
I've had an exciting life.

404
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:57,633
I want my death to be boring.

405
00:31:59,195 --> 00:32:01,112
How do you want to go?

406
00:32:01,146 --> 00:32:03,565
In the arms of the woman I love.

407
00:32:06,902 --> 00:32:09,370
She want the same thing?

408
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,077
Let's go.

409
00:32:25,888 --> 00:32:27,922
The captain of that ship--

410
00:32:27,973 --> 00:32:29,507
what was he, Braavosi?

411
00:32:29,558 --> 00:32:31,259
Pentoshi.

412
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,927
And he's headed to Oldtown?

413
00:32:32,929 --> 00:32:34,979
As I said.
Why?

414
00:32:35,014 --> 00:32:37,815
What's to stop him from
docking down the coast

415
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:40,485
and telling the locals that
Jaime Lannister is in Dorne?

416
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:42,487
A bag of gold.

417
00:32:42,521 --> 00:32:44,322
I'm not sure you understand

418
00:32:44,356 --> 00:32:46,891
how much people hate your family
in this part of the world.

419
00:32:46,926 --> 00:32:48,693
It was a heavy bag.

420
00:32:48,727 --> 00:32:51,779
And I bet he swore all
kinds of oaths to get it.

421
00:32:51,781 --> 00:32:53,615
But you won't be around
if he breaks 'em.

422
00:33:03,542 --> 00:33:05,093
<i>How many you count?</i>

423
00:33:05,127 --> 00:33:06,461
Four.

424
00:33:06,512 --> 00:33:08,179
How many do you think
you can take?

425
00:33:08,264 --> 00:33:10,365
One if he's slow.

426
00:33:14,219 --> 00:33:15,770
Halt!

427
00:33:15,804 --> 00:33:17,889
Over the hill.

428
00:33:19,608 --> 00:33:21,776
Fucked in the ass.

429
00:33:25,898 --> 00:33:27,482
Hyah!

430
00:33:31,403 --> 00:33:33,738
Morning, lads.

431
00:33:33,789 --> 00:33:35,823
Glad we found you.

432
00:33:35,825 --> 00:33:37,292
Who are you?

433
00:33:37,326 --> 00:33:39,294
Cooper.

434
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:41,629
This is Darnell.

435
00:33:41,664 --> 00:33:42,997
You're from King's Landing.

436
00:33:43,048 --> 00:33:44,832
Accent gave me away?

437
00:33:46,001 --> 00:33:48,419
Flea Bottom,
whelped and whipped.

438
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:50,171
Why are you here?

439
00:33:50,222 --> 00:33:52,006
Our ship capsized in the night.

440
00:33:52,008 --> 00:33:53,341
We managed to swim ashore.

441
00:33:53,375 --> 00:33:56,177
It was a near thing, really.

442
00:33:56,228 --> 00:33:58,680
Thought the sharks would get us.

443
00:33:58,682 --> 00:34:01,766
There are no sharks in Dorne.

444
00:34:02,985 --> 00:34:06,270
Could have sworn
those were shark fins.

445
00:34:06,322 --> 00:34:08,189
Dolphins, maybe.

446
00:34:09,775 --> 00:34:11,359
Throw your swords in the sand.

447
00:34:11,361 --> 00:34:14,162
Boys, there's no need for this.

448
00:34:14,196 --> 00:34:16,664
Just point us
in the right direction,

449
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:18,416
we'll find our way home.

450
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:20,868
Swords in the sand now.

451
00:34:40,773 --> 00:34:43,057
Hyah! Hyah!

452
00:34:48,647 --> 00:34:50,488
That one should be slow enough.

453
00:35:44,453 --> 00:35:46,120
<i>Nice move.</i>

454
00:35:47,372 --> 00:35:49,457
Luck.

455
00:35:49,508 --> 00:35:51,676
You had a wonderful teacher.

456
00:36:04,973 --> 00:36:08,392
Always wanted
a Dornish stallion.

457
00:36:08,444 --> 00:36:11,779
Beasts can run a day and
night without tiring.

458
00:36:11,814 --> 00:36:13,648
We'll ride to the Water Gardens

459
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:15,366
with a nice breeze in our faces.

460
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,561
First we need
to bury these bodies.

461
00:36:18,153 --> 00:36:19,403
Birds have to eat, too.

462
00:36:19,455 --> 00:36:21,895
Corpses raise questions.
Questions raise armies.

463
00:36:21,907 --> 00:36:24,325
We're not here to start a war.

464
00:36:24,327 --> 00:36:27,128
Do you know how long it'll take
us to dig all those holes?

465
00:36:27,162 --> 00:36:30,331
I can't dig very well
with one hand.

466
00:36:30,333 --> 00:36:32,250
Not at all, really.

467
00:37:03,365 --> 00:37:04,366
Mama.

468
00:37:10,706 --> 00:37:12,206
Nym, Obara.

469
00:37:12,208 --> 00:37:14,342
Will it be war?

470
00:37:14,376 --> 00:37:16,878
Prince Doran will weep for
your father, but nothing else.

471
00:37:16,929 --> 00:37:19,213
We must avenge Oberyn ourselves.

472
00:37:19,264 --> 00:37:22,550
Without Doran, we have no army
to march against the Lannisters.

473
00:37:22,601 --> 00:37:25,353
We don't need an army
to start a war.

474
00:37:25,387 --> 00:37:29,140
<i>Queen Cersei loves her children.</i>

475
00:37:29,191 --> 00:37:31,125
And we have one of them.

476
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,144
You may have a problem.

477
00:37:39,569 --> 00:37:41,652
A ship's captain who
found me in Planky Town

478
00:37:41,703 --> 00:37:43,321
claiming he had
information to sell.

479
00:37:43,372 --> 00:37:47,325
He told me he smuggled
Jaime Lannister into Dorne.

480
00:37:48,627 --> 00:37:50,745
He's come for Myrcella.

481
00:37:51,964 --> 00:37:53,497
If he gets to her before we do,

482
00:37:53,549 --> 00:37:56,467
we lose our only chance
for revenge.

483
00:37:56,501 --> 00:37:59,837
You must choose.

484
00:37:59,888 --> 00:38:01,756
Doran's way and peace,

485
00:38:01,758 --> 00:38:04,592
or my way and war.

486
00:38:07,095 --> 00:38:10,348
I'm with you always.

487
00:38:10,399 --> 00:38:11,933
Nym?

488
00:38:16,038 --> 00:38:18,322
Obara?

489
00:38:18,357 --> 00:38:22,243
When I was a child, Oberyn
came to take me to court.

490
00:38:22,277 --> 00:38:23,995
I had never seen this man,

491
00:38:24,029 --> 00:38:26,581
and yet he called
himself my father.

492
00:38:26,615 --> 00:38:28,082
My mother wept,

493
00:38:28,116 --> 00:38:31,369
said I was too young and a girl.

494
00:38:33,872 --> 00:38:36,791
Oberyn tossed his spear
at my feet and said,

495
00:38:36,793 --> 00:38:39,794
"Girl or boy,
we fight our battles,

496
00:38:39,796 --> 00:38:43,014
but the gods let us
choose our weapons."

497
00:38:43,048 --> 00:38:45,800
My father pointed to the spear

498
00:38:45,802 --> 00:38:47,852
and then to my mother's tears.

499
00:38:55,477 --> 00:38:57,812
I made my choice long ago.

500
00:38:59,898 --> 00:39:03,034
Will you untie me?

501
00:39:03,068 --> 00:39:06,070
<i>Will you please untie me?</i>

502
00:39:06,121 --> 00:39:08,322
Will you please?

503
00:39:31,263 --> 00:39:33,014
Thank you.

504
00:39:41,189 --> 00:39:43,024
Who are you?

505
00:39:43,026 --> 00:39:44,442
Your captor.

506
00:39:46,695 --> 00:39:48,362
Do you have wine?

507
00:39:48,364 --> 00:39:50,431
<i>No.</i>

508
00:39:50,465 --> 00:39:52,333
Can't sleep without wine.

509
00:39:52,367 --> 00:39:54,535
Then stay awake.

510
00:40:00,042 --> 00:40:02,283
You're going the wrong way.

511
00:40:03,211 --> 00:40:05,629
My sister is in Westeros.

512
00:40:05,681 --> 00:40:08,516
Westeros is west.

513
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:10,051
We're heading east.

514
00:40:10,053 --> 00:40:12,470
<i>I'm not taking you
to your sister.</i>

515
00:40:14,056 --> 00:40:16,273
You said you were
taking me to the queen.

516
00:40:16,308 --> 00:40:19,560
I am.
Queen Daenerys Targaryen.

517
00:40:19,562 --> 00:40:21,312
She's the queen I serve.

518
00:40:27,903 --> 00:40:31,238
What a waste
of a good kidnapping.

519
00:40:31,289 --> 00:40:33,741
It so happens I was
heading there myself.

520
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,910
What business would you
have with the queen?

521
00:40:35,961 --> 00:40:39,547
Gold and glory.
Oh, and hate.

522
00:40:39,581 --> 00:40:42,299
If you'd ever met my sister,
you'd understand.

523
00:40:43,752 --> 00:40:47,088
So, now that it's clear
we are on the same side...

524
00:40:56,765 --> 00:41:00,101
<i>A highborn knight from
the North of Westeros</i>

525
00:41:00,152 --> 00:41:02,653
down on his luck in Essos.

526
00:41:02,687 --> 00:41:06,690
Dragon epaulets,
bear sigil breastplate.

527
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:10,111
You're Jorah Mormont.

528
00:41:10,195 --> 00:41:12,913
<i>I have to ask.</i>

529
00:41:12,948 --> 00:41:15,116
How exactly were you
serving your queen

530
00:41:15,167 --> 00:41:17,952
in a whorehouse
half a world away?

531
00:41:18,003 --> 00:41:20,621
Is it possible
that you were running?

532
00:41:20,623 --> 00:41:23,207
Why would you be running?

533
00:41:23,258 --> 00:41:25,443
And why would she
have sent you away?

534
00:41:25,477 --> 00:41:28,712
Oh, wait.

535
00:41:28,764 --> 00:41:31,966
You were spying
on her, weren't you?

536
00:41:31,968 --> 00:41:33,634
<i>It's all coming back to me.</i>

537
00:41:33,636 --> 00:41:36,103
I was drunk through most of
the small council meetings,

538
00:41:36,138 --> 00:41:37,855
but it's all coming back.

539
00:41:37,939 --> 00:41:41,725
You passed notes
to Varys's little birds.

540
00:41:41,777 --> 00:41:44,979
<i>She found out, didn't she?</i>

541
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:48,466
<i>Found out and exiled you.</i>

542
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:53,237
Now you hope to win back
her favor with a gift.

543
00:41:53,288 --> 00:41:55,456
Risky scheme.

544
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:58,159
<i>One might even say desperate.</i>

545
00:41:59,711 --> 00:42:03,130
You think Daenerys will
execute me and pardon you?

546
00:42:04,583 --> 00:42:06,943
I'd say the reverse
is just as likely.

547
00:42:28,156 --> 00:42:31,025
Everyone looks happy
enough from up here.

548
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:34,829
What?

549
00:42:34,863 --> 00:42:36,747
I was thinking about
all the times your brother

550
00:42:36,781 --> 00:42:38,866
made me go with him
down from the Red Keep

551
00:42:38,917 --> 00:42:40,668
into the streets
of King's Landing.

552
00:42:40,702 --> 00:42:43,370
- Why?
- He liked to walk among the people.

553
00:42:43,421 --> 00:42:45,673
He liked to sing to them.

554
00:42:45,707 --> 00:42:47,208
He sang to them?

555
00:42:47,292 --> 00:42:49,210
Yes.

556
00:42:49,261 --> 00:42:51,581
Rhaegar would pick
a spot on the Hook

557
00:42:51,596 --> 00:42:54,715
or the Street of Seeds
and then he'd sing.

558
00:42:54,717 --> 00:42:56,350
Just like all
the other minstrels.

559
00:42:56,384 --> 00:42:57,551
And what did you do?

560
00:42:57,553 --> 00:42:59,186
I made sure no one killed him.

561
00:42:59,221 --> 00:43:02,223
And I collected the money.

562
00:43:02,225 --> 00:43:04,608
What? He liked to see
how much he could make.

563
00:43:04,643 --> 00:43:06,810
- He was good?
- He was very good.

564
00:43:06,862 --> 00:43:08,479
Viserys never told you?

565
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:11,615
He told me Rhaegar
was good at killing people.

566
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:13,317
Rhaegar never liked killing.

567
00:43:13,368 --> 00:43:14,451
He loved singing.

568
00:43:14,486 --> 00:43:16,570
And what did you do
with the money?

569
00:43:16,572 --> 00:43:19,790
Well, one time, he gave it to the
next minstrel down the street.

570
00:43:19,824 --> 00:43:22,493
One time, he gave it to an
orphanage in Flea Bottom.

571
00:43:22,544 --> 00:43:26,297
One time, we got horribly drunk.

572
00:43:28,216 --> 00:43:30,334
Your Grace.

573
00:43:30,385 --> 00:43:33,971
Hizdahr is here, waiting
in the audience chamber.

574
00:43:34,005 --> 00:43:35,839
How many others are there?

575
00:43:35,891 --> 00:43:38,893
50? 100?

576
00:43:38,927 --> 00:43:40,895
Will you be joining us,
Ser Barristan?

577
00:43:40,929 --> 00:43:44,732
I think I can protect you
from Hizdahr zo Loraq.

578
00:43:44,766 --> 00:43:47,268
I think I can protect me
from Hizdahr zo Loraq.

579
00:43:48,353 --> 00:43:49,853
Go, Ser Barristan.

580
00:43:49,905 --> 00:43:51,272
Sing a song for me.

581
00:43:51,323 --> 00:43:53,774
Your Grace.

582
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:02,116
All men must die, but not
all can die in glory.

583
00:44:02,118 --> 00:44:04,235
- Glory?
- Why else do men fight?

584
00:44:04,269 --> 00:44:06,503
Why did your ancestors
cross the Narrow Sea

585
00:44:06,538 --> 00:44:08,022
and conquer the Seven Kingdoms?

586
00:44:08,056 --> 00:44:10,591
So their names would live on.

587
00:44:10,625 --> 00:44:12,243
Those who find victory
in the fighting pits

588
00:44:12,277 --> 00:44:15,596
will never become kings,
but their names will live on.

589
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:17,514
It's the best chance
they'll ever have.

590
00:44:17,549 --> 00:44:19,133
Is that what
you used to tell men

591
00:44:19,135 --> 00:44:22,052
before you set them to
butchering each other for sport?

592
00:44:22,103 --> 00:44:24,855
Your Grace, today is the traditional
start of the fighting season.

593
00:44:24,889 --> 00:44:26,807
I do not recognize
this tradition.

594
00:44:26,858 --> 00:44:29,977
Traditions are the only thing
that will hold this city,

595
00:44:29,979 --> 00:44:31,712
your city, together.

596
00:44:33,148 --> 00:44:35,783
Without them, former
slaves and former masters

597
00:44:35,817 --> 00:44:37,978
have nothing in common.

598
00:44:38,987 --> 00:44:43,657
Nothing but centuries
of mistrust and resentment.

599
00:44:43,708 --> 00:44:47,294
<i>I can't promise this is the
answer to all our problems,</i>

600
00:44:47,329 --> 00:44:49,663
but it's a start.
