1
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:56,882
We're going to Braavos!

2
00:02:02,821 --> 00:02:06,425
In the old times, whenever
Braavos stood in danger,

3
00:02:06,792 --> 00:02:09,894
the Titan would step with fire in his eyes.

4
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,698
He'd wade into the sea
and smash the enemies.

5
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,167
He's just a statue.

6
00:02:21,473 --> 00:02:23,140
Don't be afraid.

7
00:02:23,408 --> 00:02:25,309
He's announcing our arrival.

8
00:02:27,212 --> 00:02:28,980
I'm not afraid.

9
00:03:37,747 --> 00:03:39,381
The House of Black and White.

10
00:03:39,749 --> 00:03:42,817
This is where you'll find the man you seek.

11
00:03:48,491 --> 00:03:50,492
Here I leave you.

12
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,801
Thank you for bringing me.

13
00:04:00,136 --> 00:04:02,270
Any man of Braavos
would have done the same.

14
00:04:04,573 --> 00:04:05,540
Valar morghulis.

15
00:04:05,775 --> 00:04:07,776
Valar dohaeris.

16
00:04:43,311 --> 00:04:44,877
Hello.

17
00:04:48,148 --> 00:04:49,949
Valar morghulis.

18
00:04:55,223 --> 00:04:56,856
Um...

19
00:05:00,794 --> 00:05:03,062
Jaqen H'ghar gave me this.

20
00:05:06,633 --> 00:05:08,534
No one here by that name.

21
00:05:08,702 --> 00:05:10,937
Please.

22
00:05:11,338 --> 00:05:14,540
I crossed the Narrow Sea.
I have nowhere else to go.

23
00:05:14,842 --> 00:05:16,408
You have everywhere else to go.

24
00:05:16,576 --> 00:05:18,410
But wait...

25
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,498
Cersei.

26
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:43,401
Walder Frey.

27
00:05:43,602 --> 00:05:45,737
The Mountain.

28
00:05:45,938 --> 00:05:47,372
Meryn Trant.

29
00:05:49,074 --> 00:05:51,041
Cersei.

30
00:05:52,578 --> 00:05:54,945
Walder Frey.

31
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,547
The Mountain.

32
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,884
Meryn Trant.

33
00:06:00,218 --> 00:06:02,853
Cersei. Walder Frey.

34
00:06:03,054 --> 00:06:05,222
The Mountain.

35
00:06:05,423 --> 00:06:07,057
Meryn Trant.

36
00:06:08,393 --> 00:06:10,227
Cersei.

37
00:06:10,428 --> 00:06:11,796
Walder Frey.

38
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,330
The Mountain.

39
00:06:13,531 --> 00:06:15,833
Meryn Trant.

40
00:06:16,034 --> 00:06:18,368
Cersei.

41
00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:21,272
Walder Frey.

42
00:06:21,472 --> 00:06:23,106
The Mountain.

43
00:06:24,609 --> 00:06:26,209
Meryn Trant.

44
00:06:57,474 --> 00:06:59,475
Must be good food if it's crowded.

45
00:07:04,147 --> 00:07:05,914
Ale?

46
00:07:13,522 --> 00:07:14,957
Ale?

47
00:07:22,932 --> 00:07:25,467
Before we left, a maester
gave you a raven scroll.

48
00:07:28,203 --> 00:07:30,605
You are becoming an observant young lady.

49
00:07:30,973 --> 00:07:33,475
My mother used to say,
"Dark wings, dark words."

50
00:07:33,809 --> 00:07:37,211
An old saying. Inaccurate in this case.

51
00:07:38,514 --> 00:07:40,081
Excuse me.

52
00:07:40,349 --> 00:07:41,850
So it was good news?

53
00:07:42,184 --> 00:07:44,151
My marriage proposal has been accepted.

54
00:07:44,552 --> 00:07:46,992
I thought you still mourned the
death of my beloved Aunt Lysa.

55
00:07:47,122 --> 00:07:48,622
Ale?

56
00:07:48,891 --> 00:07:50,691
I'll have some.

57
00:07:54,296 --> 00:07:55,296
My lady.

58
00:07:56,631 --> 00:07:57,664
What is it?

59
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,666
Sansa Stark. Don't look.

60
00:08:01,168 --> 00:08:02,302
You sure?

61
00:08:02,637 --> 00:08:03,958
She's dyed her hair, but it's her.

62
00:08:04,071 --> 00:08:05,351
She's sitting with Petyr Baelish.

63
00:08:05,407 --> 00:08:06,440
Littlefinger?

64
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:08,108
A bunch of knights with him.

65
00:08:08,476 --> 00:08:10,176
A bunch? What's a bunch, Podrick? Six? 20?

66
00:08:10,412 --> 00:08:12,345
10, I think. Too many.

67
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,320
My lady, I don't think this is the right...

68
00:08:14,348 --> 00:08:16,650
- Ready the horses.
- We only have one horse.

69
00:08:16,851 --> 00:08:18,584
Find more.

70
00:08:24,525 --> 00:08:26,059
Do you like the taste?

71
00:08:26,394 --> 00:08:28,295
I don't see what all the fuss is about.

72
00:08:28,562 --> 00:08:31,631
Why do men love it so much?

73
00:08:31,899 --> 00:08:33,666
It gives some men courage.

74
00:08:33,901 --> 00:08:35,902
Does it give you courage?

75
00:08:38,872 --> 00:08:41,173
That's far enough.

76
00:08:41,442 --> 00:08:44,510
Lord Baelish, Lady Sansa.

77
00:08:44,778 --> 00:08:46,646
My name is Brienne of Tarth.

78
00:08:46,947 --> 00:08:49,114
We've met with Renly Baratheon.

79
00:08:50,383 --> 00:08:52,318
What did he say about you?

80
00:08:52,685 --> 00:08:57,356
He said, "Your loyalty
came free of charge."

81
00:08:59,292 --> 00:09:01,612
Someone appears to have paid
quite a bit for it since then.

82
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,642
Lady Sansa,

83
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,611
before your mother's death,

84
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:21,913
I was her sworn sword.

85
00:09:22,281 --> 00:09:25,049
I gave my word I would
find you and protect you.

86
00:09:25,417 --> 00:09:28,419
I will shield your back
and keep your counsel

87
00:09:28,753 --> 00:09:31,155
and give my life for yours if need be.

88
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:34,459
I swear it by the old gods and the new.

89
00:09:35,894 --> 00:09:37,695
Please, Lady Brienne,

90
00:09:37,963 --> 00:09:39,530
no need for such formality.

91
00:09:39,831 --> 00:09:41,966
You were Catelyn Stark's sworn sword?

92
00:09:42,233 --> 00:09:44,167
- I was.
- Strange.

93
00:09:44,503 --> 00:09:45,636
I knew Cat from the time we were children.

94
00:09:45,904 --> 00:09:47,538
She never mentioned you.

95
00:09:47,806 --> 00:09:49,507
It was after Renly's murder.

96
00:09:49,674 --> 00:09:50,808
Ah, yes.

97
00:09:51,109 --> 00:09:52,610
You were accused of killing him.

98
00:09:52,944 --> 00:09:55,345
- I tried to save him.
- But you were accused.

99
00:09:55,647 --> 00:09:57,414
By men who didn't see what happened.

100
00:09:57,648 --> 00:09:59,116
And what did happen?

101
00:10:03,587 --> 00:10:05,722
He was murdered by a shadow.

102
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:08,425
A shadow with the face
of Stannis Baratheon.

103
00:10:08,626 --> 00:10:11,694
A shadow?

104
00:10:11,962 --> 00:10:15,297
With the face...

105
00:10:16,767 --> 00:10:18,668
This woman swore to protect Renly.

106
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:20,036
She failed.

107
00:10:20,437 --> 00:10:23,472
She swore to protect
your mother. She failed.

108
00:10:23,941 --> 00:10:27,710
Why would I want somebody with your
history of failure guarding Lady Sansa?

109
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:29,878
Why should you have any say in her affairs?

110
00:10:30,147 --> 00:10:31,447
Because I am her uncle.

111
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,783
I married her Aunt Lysa shortly
before my beloved's untimely death.

112
00:10:35,118 --> 00:10:37,686
We're family now and you are an outsider.

113
00:10:38,155 --> 00:10:41,557
Forgive me, Lady Brienne, but
experience has made me wary of outsiders.

114
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,693
Lady Sansa, if we can have a word alone...

115
00:10:44,861 --> 00:10:46,161
No.

116
00:10:46,495 --> 00:10:47,935
Please, my lady. If I could explain...

117
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:50,465
I saw you at Joffrey's
wedding bowing to the king.

118
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,036
Neither of us wanted to be there.

119
00:10:54,336 --> 00:10:55,771
Sometimes we don't have a choice.

120
00:10:56,005 --> 00:10:58,073
And sometimes we do.

121
00:10:59,508 --> 00:11:02,310
You should leave.

122
00:11:02,711 --> 00:11:05,111
We don't want our new friend
wandering the countryside alone.

123
00:11:05,381 --> 00:11:06,948
The roads in these parts aren't safe.

124
00:11:07,183 --> 00:11:08,216
Why don't you stay?

125
00:11:17,693 --> 00:11:19,727
The man asked you to stay...

126
00:11:22,263 --> 00:11:24,999
Hyah! Hyah!

127
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:33,841
Hyah! Hyah!

128
00:11:34,175 --> 00:11:36,876
After her!

129
00:11:48,423 --> 00:11:50,257
- Yah! Hah!
- Oh!

130
00:12:07,642 --> 00:12:09,642
- Stop! Stop!
- I'll take him!

131
00:12:10,944 --> 00:12:12,978
Podrick!

132
00:12:13,247 --> 00:12:15,281
Hold on to her!

133
00:12:18,118 --> 00:12:19,752
Take her!

134
00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:37,036
Keep moving!

135
00:12:48,614 --> 00:12:51,249
Stop! Stop! Stop!

136
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,318
Stop! Stop!

137
00:12:56,455 --> 00:12:58,790
That's a good boy. Come on. Come on.

138
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:03,494
No, no, no, stop!

139
00:13:23,215 --> 00:13:25,916
I guess that means you're unarmed.

140
00:13:26,218 --> 00:13:27,984
Down, Podrick! Down!

141
00:13:47,538 --> 00:13:50,640
- Podrick.
- Yes, my lady?

142
00:13:50,874 --> 00:13:52,842
You can stand now.

143
00:13:53,043 --> 00:13:54,644
Yes, my lady.

144
00:13:58,081 --> 00:14:00,350
Sansa Stark?

145
00:14:00,684 --> 00:14:02,918
Wary of strangers, as she should be.

146
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,320
I saw her riding on the
East Road with Littlefinger.

147
00:14:05,355 --> 00:14:06,555
We'll follow them.

148
00:14:06,923 --> 00:14:11,026
My lady, if both Stark
girls refused your service,

149
00:14:11,327 --> 00:14:12,728
maybe you're released from your vow.

150
00:14:13,096 --> 00:14:15,164
I swore to their mother I
would protect those girls.

151
00:14:15,498 --> 00:14:16,398
But if they don't want your protection...

152
00:14:16,767 --> 00:14:18,433
Do you think she's safe with Littlefinger?

153
00:14:20,936 --> 00:14:22,604
No, my lady.

154
00:14:22,838 --> 00:14:24,506
Get your horse.

155
00:14:34,183 --> 00:14:35,917
A summons from the queen.

156
00:14:54,202 --> 00:14:57,037
There are only two like it in the world.

157
00:14:57,406 --> 00:14:59,507
The one I'm wearing, the
one I gave to Myrcella.

158
00:14:59,874 --> 00:15:02,376
- It's a threat.
- Of course it's a threat.

159
00:15:02,644 --> 00:15:05,078
Our daughter's alone in Dorne

160
00:15:05,414 --> 00:15:08,649
surrounded by people who hate our family.

161
00:15:08,883 --> 00:15:10,450
"It's a threat."

162
00:15:12,253 --> 00:15:13,486
No note?

163
00:15:13,888 --> 00:15:16,756
They blame us for the death
of Oberyn and his sister

164
00:15:17,225 --> 00:15:19,927
and every other tragedy that's
befallen their cursed country.

165
00:15:20,328 --> 00:15:22,569
I will burn their cities to
the ground if they touch her.

166
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:23,931
- Softer.
- What?

167
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:25,799
Not so loud.

168
00:15:26,234 --> 00:15:28,267
Our daughter's in danger and you're
worried I'm speaking too loudly?

169
00:15:28,602 --> 00:15:30,670
The world can't know she's our daughter.

170
00:15:32,272 --> 00:15:34,140
Then don't call her your daughter.

171
00:15:34,442 --> 00:15:36,042
You've never been a father to her.

172
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,378
If I was a father to any of my
children, they'd be stoned in the street.

173
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:40,680
And what has your caution brought?

174
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:45,151
Our eldest child murdered
at his own wedding.

175
00:15:45,485 --> 00:15:47,686
Our only daughter shipped off to Dorne.

176
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,289
Our baby boy set to marry

177
00:15:50,623 --> 00:15:53,092
that smirking whore from Highgarden.

178
00:16:02,101 --> 00:16:03,435
I'm going to make things better.

179
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,091
You've never made anything better.

180
00:16:05,271 --> 00:16:06,338
I'm going to Dorne

181
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,574
and I'm bringing our daughter home.

182
00:16:08,941 --> 00:16:11,243
You can't just ask Prince Doran

183
00:16:11,478 --> 00:16:13,379
to give her back.

184
00:16:13,646 --> 00:16:14,847
She's promised to his son.

185
00:16:15,147 --> 00:16:17,615
I'm not going to ask him anything.

186
00:16:17,984 --> 00:16:19,984
You go down there with an
army, it's an act of war.

187
00:16:19,986 --> 00:16:21,486
No army.

188
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,621
Do you know where they're keeping her?

189
00:16:26,993 --> 00:16:28,960
Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens.

190
00:16:29,161 --> 00:16:30,896
I'll find her.

191
00:16:33,532 --> 00:16:35,633
Is there anything else, Your Grace?

192
00:16:37,569 --> 00:16:40,371
You're going to Dorne?

193
00:16:41,507 --> 00:16:44,742
A one-handed man alone?

194
00:16:46,077 --> 00:16:47,845
I never said I was going alone.

195
00:16:56,221 --> 00:16:58,555
No sunflowers. I don't like yellow.

196
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:01,125
Roses are very nice. Definitely roses.

197
00:17:01,393 --> 00:17:02,793
And music. I adore music.

198
00:17:03,061 --> 00:17:04,895
But no flutes. I hate flutes.

199
00:17:05,263 --> 00:17:07,064
We can have a harp if
you like, but no flutes.

200
00:17:07,398 --> 00:17:09,599
Then there's the food. Food
is the most important thing.

201
00:17:09,867 --> 00:17:11,868
Don't you agree? We're
going to need pigeon pies.

202
00:17:12,236 --> 00:17:15,138
That's what they eat in
the capital, don't they?

203
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:16,840
Don't they?

204
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:19,709
Don't who?

205
00:17:20,044 --> 00:17:22,745
People eat pigeon pie in the capital.

206
00:17:24,248 --> 00:17:25,614
They certainly do, my dear.

207
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:28,084
They certainly do.

208
00:17:28,385 --> 00:17:30,353
It's a fine place, isn't it?

209
00:17:30,554 --> 00:17:32,155
A fine place.

210
00:17:32,423 --> 00:17:34,190
I never thought I'd end up

211
00:17:34,524 --> 00:17:37,126
settling down in a place like this.

212
00:17:37,394 --> 00:17:40,496
- You won't.
- Pardon?

213
00:17:40,797 --> 00:17:42,397
We won't get to live at Stokeworth.

214
00:17:42,866 --> 00:17:45,386
When Mother dies, my sister gets
the castle because she's older.

215
00:17:45,435 --> 00:17:47,369
- Oh.
- She hates me.

216
00:17:47,737 --> 00:17:49,805
She calls me mean names
and sometimes even still

217
00:17:50,139 --> 00:17:52,775
she pulls my hair when
Mother's not looking.

218
00:17:54,377 --> 00:17:56,111
You know what I think?

219
00:17:56,412 --> 00:17:58,347
I think you're a good person.

220
00:17:58,647 --> 00:18:00,615
And your sister is a mean person.

221
00:18:00,783 --> 00:18:02,217
She is.

222
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,954
I've been all over the world,

223
00:18:06,255 --> 00:18:08,056
and if there's one thing I've learned,

224
00:18:08,324 --> 00:18:11,093
it's that meanness comes around.

225
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,927
People like your sister,

226
00:18:13,295 --> 00:18:16,397
they always get what's
coming to them eventually.

227
00:18:16,632 --> 00:18:18,600
One way or another.

228
00:18:21,804 --> 00:18:23,838
Who's that?

229
00:18:26,274 --> 00:18:28,109
Jaime fucking Lannister.

230
00:18:30,278 --> 00:18:32,846
- Ser Jaime.
- Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

231
00:18:34,616 --> 00:18:36,717
I was very sorry to hear about your father.

232
00:18:36,918 --> 00:18:38,352
Thank you.

233
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:41,322
This is my betrothed Lollys.

234
00:18:43,325 --> 00:18:44,858
A pleasure.

235
00:18:47,028 --> 00:18:48,695
Run along, love.

236
00:18:54,936 --> 00:18:57,270
Beautiful young bride you've chosen.

237
00:18:57,605 --> 00:18:59,439
When were you planning on getting married?

238
00:18:59,774 --> 00:19:01,674
- Just get on with it.
- On with what?

239
00:19:01,942 --> 00:19:03,576
What you're here for.

240
00:19:04,045 --> 00:19:06,212
There's no way this little visit could
possibly mean anything good for me.

241
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,714
It's very good for you.

242
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:23,162
Lollys will be marrying Ser Willis Bracken.

243
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,463
Mmm.

244
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:27,332
We made a deal, your sister and I.

245
00:19:27,801 --> 00:19:30,302
- I would have advised against that.
- How is this good for me?

246
00:19:30,804 --> 00:19:33,138
'Cause you're going to come with me
and help me with something important.

247
00:19:33,574 --> 00:19:36,675
And when we return, I'm going
to give you a much better girl

248
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:38,677
and a much better castle.

249
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:43,648
Return from where?

250
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,085
As far south as south goes.

251
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:03,101
My future queen.

252
00:20:21,052 --> 00:20:23,254
The prince does not wish to be disturbed.

253
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,155
Remove yourself from my path

254
00:20:25,523 --> 00:20:27,324
or I'll take that longaxe
and I'll shove it...

255
00:20:27,558 --> 00:20:28,759
Captain.

256
00:20:30,461 --> 00:20:31,895
Let her pass.

257
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:38,135
Your brother was murdered

258
00:20:38,436 --> 00:20:40,337
and you sit here in the Water Gardens

259
00:20:40,638 --> 00:20:42,772
staring at the sky and doing nothing.

260
00:20:43,107 --> 00:20:45,575
Oberyn was slain during a trial by combat.

261
00:20:45,876 --> 00:20:47,043
By law, that is not murder.

262
00:20:47,411 --> 00:20:49,613
- Your brother.
- You don't have to remind me.

263
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,415
He was my brother long
before he was anything to you.

264
00:20:52,716 --> 00:20:54,551
What will you do about his death?

265
00:20:54,885 --> 00:20:56,919
I will bury him. I will mourn for him.

266
00:20:57,287 --> 00:20:59,789
- And then?
- You would have me go to war?

267
00:21:00,124 --> 00:21:01,290
The whole country would have you go to war.

268
00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:04,226
Then we are lucky the whole
country does not decide.

269
00:21:06,664 --> 00:21:08,330
The Sand Snakes are with me.

270
00:21:08,632 --> 00:21:09,993
They have the love of their people.

271
00:21:10,167 --> 00:21:12,568
They will avenge their
father while you sit here

272
00:21:12,836 --> 00:21:15,504
in your chair doing nothing.

273
00:21:19,342 --> 00:21:21,043
Oberyn is dead

274
00:21:21,444 --> 00:21:24,913
and this Lannister girl
skips about the Water Gardens

275
00:21:25,248 --> 00:21:29,017
eating our food, breathing our air.

276
00:21:29,452 --> 00:21:32,020
How many of your brothers and
sisters do they have to kill?

277
00:21:33,622 --> 00:21:35,290
Let me have her.

278
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:40,862
Let me send her to Cersei
one finger at a time.

279
00:21:42,598 --> 00:21:44,499
I loved my brother.

280
00:21:44,767 --> 00:21:46,801
And you made him very happy.

281
00:21:47,169 --> 00:21:49,870
For that, you will always
have a place in my heart.

282
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,210
But we do not mutilate
little girls for vengeance.

283
00:21:55,377 --> 00:21:56,877
Not here.

284
00:21:57,112 --> 00:21:58,813
Not while I rule.

285
00:22:00,282 --> 00:22:02,149
And how long will that be?

286
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:20,367
The Unsullied are too conspicuous.

287
00:22:20,702 --> 00:22:23,337
Anyone can see you coming from a mile off.

288
00:22:23,705 --> 00:22:25,665
Of course you haven't
found any Sons of the Harpy.

289
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,774
You haven't, have you?

290
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:32,613
My Second Sons, on the other hand,

291
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,682
they drink, they whore,

292
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:37,483
fight in the streets,

293
00:22:37,684 --> 00:22:39,018
they blend in.

294
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:41,320
They overhear things in taverns,

295
00:22:41,722 --> 00:22:44,958
follow people from the
taverns to nice, quiet alleys,

296
00:22:45,192 --> 00:22:47,260
break a few fingers,

297
00:22:47,527 --> 00:22:49,262
overhear a few more things.

298
00:22:50,731 --> 00:22:52,198
Before you know it...

299
00:23:11,885 --> 00:23:14,219
No one here.

300
00:23:14,387 --> 00:23:15,620
We go.

301
00:23:15,889 --> 00:23:18,423
In a hurry? You're afraid?

302
00:23:18,691 --> 00:23:20,558
Unsullied fear nothing.

303
00:23:20,726 --> 00:23:22,494
Right.

304
00:23:22,728 --> 00:23:24,462
That's your problem.

305
00:23:24,764 --> 00:23:26,798
You understood fear once long ago,

306
00:23:27,099 --> 00:23:28,667
but you've forgotten what it means.

307
00:23:28,934 --> 00:23:32,404
Someone who's forgotten fear

308
00:23:32,638 --> 00:23:33,971
has forgotten how to hide.

309
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:44,982
Fear is useful that way.

310
00:24:09,641 --> 00:24:13,176
Sons of the Harpy, they want
to put a collar back on my neck.

311
00:24:13,411 --> 00:24:14,545
On all of our necks.

312
00:24:14,846 --> 00:24:16,412
Please, Your Grace, you must kill him.

313
00:24:16,647 --> 00:24:17,848
It would send a message.

314
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:20,616
I think you should exercise
restraint, Your Grace.

315
00:24:21,018 --> 00:24:23,486
- Why?
- For one thing, he may have valuable information.

316
00:24:23,855 --> 00:24:26,589
The Son of the Harpy has no
more valuable information.

317
00:24:26,824 --> 00:24:27,690
How do you know that?

318
00:24:27,959 --> 00:24:29,993
Because I questioned him.

319
00:24:30,328 --> 00:24:31,929
And the information you did get,

320
00:24:32,195 --> 00:24:33,835
- he is young and poor.
- He is born free.

321
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,965
Why should he want to bring back
slavery? What did it do for him?

322
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:37,500
Perhaps the only thing that gave him pride

323
00:24:37,868 --> 00:24:39,435
was knowing that there was
someone lower than he was.

324
00:24:39,636 --> 00:24:40,870
They pay him.

325
00:24:41,171 --> 00:24:42,571
Great families afraid to do a thing.

326
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,440
They pay poor man to do it for them.

327
00:24:44,842 --> 00:24:46,242
- And how do you know this?
- Everyone know this.

328
00:24:46,643 --> 00:24:48,643
I don't know it and I'm
the head of a great family.

329
00:24:48,711 --> 00:24:50,952
We do not know what this
man did or didn't do.

330
00:24:51,214 --> 00:24:54,683
Give him a trial at least. A fair trial.

331
00:24:54,985 --> 00:24:56,818
Show all the citizens of Meereen

332
00:24:57,187 --> 00:24:58,854
that you're better than
those who would depose you.

333
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:00,756
Teach them a better way.

334
00:25:01,157 --> 00:25:03,077
I do not know the place
from where Old Ser comes.

335
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,294
Things maybe are different there, I hope.

336
00:25:06,529 --> 00:25:08,530
But here in Meereen,

337
00:25:08,831 --> 00:25:11,366
before Daenerys Stormborn, they own us.

338
00:25:11,667 --> 00:25:13,568
So we learn much about them

339
00:25:13,836 --> 00:25:15,804
or we do not live long.

340
00:25:16,071 --> 00:25:18,172
They teach me what they are.

341
00:25:18,541 --> 00:25:22,610
Mercy, fair trial...
these mean nothing to them.

342
00:25:22,878 --> 00:25:25,079
All they understand is blood.

343
00:25:30,352 --> 00:25:32,220
Thank you all for your counsel.

344
00:25:40,562 --> 00:25:42,963
Your Grace, a word, please, I beg you.

345
00:25:43,264 --> 00:25:45,733
- About what?
- About your father.

346
00:25:46,067 --> 00:25:48,068
- About the Mad King.
- The Mad King?

347
00:25:48,403 --> 00:25:49,537
You're here to remind
me of my enemies' lies?

348
00:25:49,771 --> 00:25:51,071
Consider me reminded.

349
00:25:51,406 --> 00:25:54,808
Your Grace, I served in his Kingsguard.

350
00:25:55,109 --> 00:25:56,910
I was at his side from the first.

351
00:25:57,178 --> 00:25:59,546
Your enemies did not lie.

352
00:26:01,049 --> 00:26:02,749
Go on.

353
00:26:04,618 --> 00:26:07,154
When the people rose in revolt against him,

354
00:26:07,521 --> 00:26:10,657
your father set their
towns and castles aflame.

355
00:26:11,024 --> 00:26:14,026
He murdered sons in front of their fathers.

356
00:26:14,361 --> 00:26:16,395
He burned men alive with wildfire

357
00:26:16,697 --> 00:26:19,532
and laughed as they screamed.

358
00:26:19,867 --> 00:26:23,102
And his efforts to stamp out dissent

359
00:26:23,537 --> 00:26:27,573
led to rebellion that killed
every Targaryen except two.

360
00:26:27,774 --> 00:26:29,976
I'm not my father.

361
00:26:30,277 --> 00:26:33,579
No, Your Grace. Thank the gods.

362
00:26:34,081 --> 00:26:37,984
But the Mad King gave his enemies
the justice he thought they deserved.

363
00:26:38,385 --> 00:26:41,887
And each time, it made him
feel powerful and right.

364
00:26:43,223 --> 00:26:44,389
Until the very end.

365
00:26:49,562 --> 00:26:51,597
I will not have the Son
of the Harpy executed

366
00:26:51,831 --> 00:26:53,298
without a fair trial.

367
00:26:56,669 --> 00:26:58,904
Your Grace.

368
00:27:07,779 --> 00:27:09,747
There's a bug.

369
00:27:09,982 --> 00:27:11,249
Yes, best be careful.

370
00:27:11,617 --> 00:27:13,818
You might accidently
consume some solid food.

371
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,953
When I agreed to come with you,

372
00:27:16,255 --> 00:27:18,623
did I misrepresent my intentions?

373
00:27:23,194 --> 00:27:25,997
Besides, what else is there for me to do

374
00:27:26,264 --> 00:27:28,032
inside this fucking box?

375
00:27:28,366 --> 00:27:30,126
- You don't like it?
- I want to take a walk.

376
00:27:30,168 --> 00:27:31,068
You can't.

377
00:27:31,336 --> 00:27:32,770
Cersei has offered a lordship

378
00:27:33,104 --> 00:27:34,938
to the man who brings her your head.

379
00:27:35,206 --> 00:27:36,806
She ought to offer her cunt.

380
00:27:37,142 --> 00:27:39,543
Best part of her for the best part of me.

381
00:27:39,977 --> 00:27:43,514
Well, I suppose a box is as
good a place for me as anywhere.

382
00:27:43,881 --> 00:27:46,750
Are we really going to spend
the entire road to Volantis

383
00:27:47,052 --> 00:27:48,785
talking about the futility of everything?

384
00:27:49,054 --> 00:27:50,687
You're right. No point.

385
00:27:50,955 --> 00:27:52,922
The road to Volantis?

386
00:27:53,323 --> 00:27:55,824
You said we were going to
Meereen. What's in Volantis?

387
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,460
The road to Meereen.

388
00:27:57,894 --> 00:28:00,896
And what do you hope to find at
the end of the road to Meereen?

389
00:28:01,165 --> 00:28:03,232
I told you. A ruler.

390
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,301
We've already got a ruler.

391
00:28:05,635 --> 00:28:08,071
Everywhere has already got a ruler.

392
00:28:08,405 --> 00:28:11,006
Every pile of shit on
the side of every road

393
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,008
has someone's banner hanging from it.

394
00:28:13,342 --> 00:28:17,046
You were quite good, you know, at ruling.

395
00:28:17,346 --> 00:28:19,615
During your brief tenure as Hand.

396
00:28:19,883 --> 00:28:21,617
I didn't rule. I was a servant.

397
00:28:21,851 --> 00:28:23,852
Still, a man of talent.

398
00:28:24,153 --> 00:28:25,433
Managed to kill a lot of people.

399
00:28:25,821 --> 00:28:29,657
Yes, but you showed great
promise in other areas as well.

400
00:28:33,196 --> 00:28:35,663
She wanted me to leave King's Landing.

401
00:28:35,864 --> 00:28:37,765
She begged me.

402
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,468
I wouldn't go.

403
00:28:39,602 --> 00:28:40,802
Why?

404
00:28:41,036 --> 00:28:43,071
'Cause I liked it.

405
00:28:43,338 --> 00:28:46,841
Power. Even as a servant.

406
00:28:47,076 --> 00:28:50,078
People follow leaders.

407
00:28:50,378 --> 00:28:51,946
And they will never follow us.

408
00:28:52,214 --> 00:28:53,848
They find us repulsive.

409
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:55,382
I find us repulsive.

410
00:28:55,618 --> 00:28:57,418
And we find them repulsive,

411
00:28:57,853 --> 00:29:00,787
which is why we surround ourselves
with large, comfortable boxes

412
00:29:01,022 --> 00:29:02,590
to keep them away.

413
00:29:02,757 --> 00:29:04,891
And yet,

414
00:29:05,127 --> 00:29:07,228
no matter what we do,

415
00:29:07,695 --> 00:29:11,565
people like you and me are never
really satisfied inside the box.

416
00:29:11,766 --> 00:29:13,900
Not for long.

417
00:29:14,102 --> 00:29:16,003
You're right.

418
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:18,538
- Let's go for a walk.
- No.

419
00:29:18,873 --> 00:29:21,642
How many dwarves are there in the world?

420
00:29:21,943 --> 00:29:23,977
Is Cersei going to kill them all?

421
00:29:28,616 --> 00:29:30,183
Not him.

422
00:29:30,484 --> 00:29:32,118
Are you trying to deceive your queen?

423
00:29:32,453 --> 00:29:34,820
Shall I throw them in a cell, Your Grace?

424
00:29:35,122 --> 00:29:36,656
That won't be necessary, Ser Meryn.

425
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:39,225
I don't want to dissuade the other hunters.

426
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,194
Mistakes will be made.

427
00:29:41,595 --> 00:29:43,062
- Thank you, Your Grace, thank you.
- Your Grace, thank you.

428
00:29:43,397 --> 00:29:44,998
- Take the head.
- Pardon me, Your Grace.

429
00:29:45,132 --> 00:29:46,832
I would take it if you don't mind.

430
00:29:47,134 --> 00:29:49,669
It could prove useful for my work.

431
00:29:49,836 --> 00:29:51,303
Very good.

432
00:29:54,274 --> 00:29:56,441
Over there will be fine.

433
00:29:57,443 --> 00:29:59,945
You heard the man. Over there.

434
00:30:27,707 --> 00:30:29,107
You're the Hand of the King?

435
00:30:29,308 --> 00:30:30,775
No, Uncle.

436
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,043
Clearly it would not be appropriate

437
00:30:32,344 --> 00:30:34,512
for a woman to assume that role.

438
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,760
I'm merely advising my
son until he comes of age

439
00:30:36,949 --> 00:30:38,349
and chooses a Hand for himself.

440
00:30:38,783 --> 00:30:41,785
Your Grace, I would be
willing to serve provisionally

441
00:30:42,153 --> 00:30:44,033
as the King's Hand until
he becomes old enough...

442
00:30:44,323 --> 00:30:45,563
You're a good man, Lord Tyrell,

443
00:30:45,857 --> 00:30:47,725
but I don't imagine you'll have the time.

444
00:30:48,026 --> 00:30:49,893
In addition to being Master of Ships,

445
00:30:50,229 --> 00:30:52,796
the king has appointed you Master of Coin.

446
00:30:54,032 --> 00:30:55,132
Oh, Your Grace.

447
00:30:55,466 --> 00:30:57,034
He called your experience and wisdom

448
00:30:57,335 --> 00:30:59,302
in financial matters unparalleled.

449
00:30:59,637 --> 00:31:01,705
He said he would be honored to have you

450
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,760
represent the crown's
interests in the same.

451
00:31:03,842 --> 00:31:05,609
The honor is all mine, Your Grace.

452
00:31:05,977 --> 00:31:08,746
Your Grace, in the past
on several occasions,

453
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,514
a Grand Maester has
served as the King's Hand.

454
00:31:11,882 --> 00:31:16,185
The king has named Qyburn
the new Master of Whisperers.

455
00:31:17,988 --> 00:31:20,657
Your Grace, him? This... this man?

456
00:31:20,991 --> 00:31:24,261
This embarrassment to the Citadel?

457
00:31:24,562 --> 00:31:27,496
Your Grace, what qualifications

458
00:31:27,831 --> 00:31:29,431
can he possibly have for this post?

459
00:31:29,767 --> 00:31:32,368
The qualification of
loyalty, Grand Maester.

460
00:31:32,702 --> 00:31:34,303
That's far more than the eunuch ever had.

461
00:31:34,404 --> 00:31:36,973
Far more than many ever have.

462
00:31:37,241 --> 00:31:39,809
I must say, I cannot see...

463
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:42,211
Uncle Kevan, in light of your position

464
00:31:42,545 --> 00:31:44,045
as commander of the Lannister armies,

465
00:31:44,514 --> 00:31:47,583
it would please the king if you
would serve as his Master of War.

466
00:31:47,917 --> 00:31:50,786
No man living better deserves the title.

467
00:31:51,053 --> 00:31:53,054
That is kind of you to say.

468
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:55,191
I would like to hear it
from the king himself.

469
00:31:55,525 --> 00:31:56,965
The king is very busy at this moment.

470
00:31:57,294 --> 00:31:59,461
He should be here learning
what it means to rule.

471
00:31:59,696 --> 00:32:01,029
He is learning.

472
00:32:01,397 --> 00:32:03,298
On this occasion, in his capacity as ruler,

473
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:05,801
he's asked me to speak on his behalf.

474
00:32:06,235 --> 00:32:09,137
I returned to the capital to
pay my respects to my brother.

475
00:32:09,438 --> 00:32:12,607
And to you. And to serve the king.

476
00:32:12,909 --> 00:32:14,642
I did not return to the capital

477
00:32:14,911 --> 00:32:16,311
to serve as your puppet.

478
00:32:16,712 --> 00:32:20,080
To watch you stack the small
council with sycophants.

479
00:32:20,449 --> 00:32:22,650
Sending your own brother
away so he wouldn't be...

480
00:32:22,984 --> 00:32:24,504
My brother has left the capital to lead

481
00:32:24,653 --> 00:32:26,220
a sensitive diplomatic mission.

482
00:32:26,422 --> 00:32:27,254
What mission?

483
00:32:27,623 --> 00:32:30,425
That is not your concern as Master of War.

484
00:32:32,127 --> 00:32:33,727
I do not recognize your authority

485
00:32:34,062 --> 00:32:36,964
to dictate what is and is not my concern.

486
00:32:37,299 --> 00:32:40,500
You are the Queen Mother, nothing more.

487
00:32:44,572 --> 00:32:46,974
You would abandon your
king in his time of need?

488
00:32:47,342 --> 00:32:50,310
If he wants to send for me,
I will be waiting for him.

489
00:32:50,511 --> 00:32:52,612
At Casterly Rock.

490
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,288
Come on, you know this one.

491
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:05,692
It looks like an animal.

492
00:33:08,162 --> 00:33:09,929
Snake.

493
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:12,565
Sssnake. S.

494
00:33:12,867 --> 00:33:15,101
- It's an S.
- Right, very good.

495
00:33:15,269 --> 00:33:17,237
Huh!

496
00:33:17,637 --> 00:33:19,838
Did you know that the youngest
Lord Commander in history

497
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,141
Osric Stark was elected at the age of 10?

498
00:33:24,177 --> 00:33:26,011
I know S.

499
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:27,747
You'll learn, I promise.

500
00:33:28,281 --> 00:33:31,081
I taught Ser Davos, and old people
are terrible at learning new things.

501
00:33:31,117 --> 00:33:34,052
Well, you're a wonderful teacher.

502
00:33:34,287 --> 00:33:35,688
Very patient.

503
00:33:36,122 --> 00:33:38,624
I only said that the more
time that you spend practicing,

504
00:33:38,958 --> 00:33:40,279
the faster you'll be able to read.

505
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,761
That's all right. We're doing just fine.

506
00:33:43,029 --> 00:33:45,230
I'm sure you and "Ostrich" Stark

507
00:33:45,498 --> 00:33:47,900
have a lot to talk about.

508
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:52,570
How old were you when
you learned how to read?

509
00:33:52,805 --> 00:33:54,273
- Three.
- Three?

510
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,661
Who taught you, your mother?

511
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:59,310
No, old Maester Cressen did.

512
00:33:59,578 --> 00:34:01,045
I had a lot of time to practice.

513
00:34:01,346 --> 00:34:03,314
My mother kept me inside because...

514
00:34:05,551 --> 00:34:07,519
What do you call it in the south,

515
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,521
what happened to your face?

516
00:34:09,722 --> 00:34:11,289
Greyscale.

517
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:14,158
What do you call it north of the Wall?

518
00:34:14,359 --> 00:34:16,460
I don't know.

519
00:34:16,728 --> 00:34:18,062
But two of my sisters had it.

520
00:34:18,263 --> 00:34:19,897
They both died.

521
00:34:20,165 --> 00:34:21,299
How did they cure you?

522
00:34:21,533 --> 00:34:23,100
I don't remember.

523
00:34:23,335 --> 00:34:24,601
I was a baby.

524
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:26,537
Lots of people came and tried, I think.

525
00:34:26,838 --> 00:34:28,939
Whatever they did, it went away.

526
00:34:31,008 --> 00:34:32,543
What happened to your sisters?

527
00:34:35,012 --> 00:34:39,416
My father made them move out of
the keep into the huts outside.

528
00:34:39,751 --> 00:34:41,585
None of us were allowed to go near them.

529
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:45,989
But we heard them, especially at night.

530
00:34:46,357 --> 00:34:50,260
They started to sound not like themselves.

531
00:34:50,527 --> 00:34:52,595
Did you ever see them?

532
00:34:53,864 --> 00:34:55,865
Only once at the end.

533
00:34:57,701 --> 00:34:59,635
They were covered with it.

534
00:34:59,903 --> 00:35:02,738
Their faces, their arms.

535
00:35:04,107 --> 00:35:05,274
They acted like animals.

536
00:35:06,977 --> 00:35:10,045
My father had to drag them
out to the woods on a rope.

537
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,582
What did he do with them in the woods?

538
00:35:18,154 --> 00:35:19,588
Mother.

539
00:35:19,789 --> 00:35:21,256
Leave us.

540
00:35:24,127 --> 00:35:25,227
Your Grace.

541
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,670
You need to stay away from that girl.

542
00:35:28,831 --> 00:35:30,065
- Why?
- She's a wildling.

543
00:35:30,333 --> 00:35:32,301
Her name is Gilly. She's nice.

544
00:35:32,568 --> 00:35:33,568
I'm teaching her to read.

545
00:35:33,636 --> 00:35:34,903
She's a wildling.

546
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:36,605
Your father defeated her people.

547
00:35:36,906 --> 00:35:39,574
He executed their king for treason.

548
00:35:39,942 --> 00:35:42,310
They could strike at
him by striking at you.

549
00:35:42,578 --> 00:35:44,646
Gilly wouldn't do that.

550
00:35:46,248 --> 00:35:48,783
You have no idea what people will do.

551
00:35:49,118 --> 00:35:51,185
All your books and you still don't know.

552
00:35:57,626 --> 00:35:59,666
I ordered Mance Rayder burned at the stake.

553
00:35:59,961 --> 00:36:02,330
You prevented that order
from being carried out.

554
00:36:02,631 --> 00:36:04,899
You showed mercy to Mance Rayder.

555
00:36:05,134 --> 00:36:07,402
A king's word is law.

556
00:36:07,769 --> 00:36:09,610
Perhaps you should ask
Ser Davos how much mercy

557
00:36:09,704 --> 00:36:11,772
I show to lawbreakers.

558
00:36:15,544 --> 00:36:17,345
Show too much kindness,
people won't fear you.

559
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:19,480
If they don't fear you,
they don't follow you.

560
00:36:19,548 --> 00:36:21,248
With respect, Your Grace,

561
00:36:21,683 --> 00:36:24,784
the free folk will never follow
you no matter what you do.

562
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,799
You're the man who burned their king alive.

563
00:36:26,887 --> 00:36:28,888
Who, then?

564
00:36:30,624 --> 00:36:31,691
You?

565
00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:33,660
No.

566
00:36:33,894 --> 00:36:35,795
Only one of their own.

567
00:36:37,965 --> 00:36:40,133
Do you know this wretched girl,

568
00:36:40,334 --> 00:36:41,701
Lyanna Mormont?

569
00:36:41,969 --> 00:36:43,703
The Lord Commander's niece.

570
00:36:44,038 --> 00:36:47,073
Lady of Bear Island and a child of 10.

571
00:36:49,309 --> 00:36:51,869
I asked her to commit her house
to my cause. That's her response.

572
00:36:52,212 --> 00:36:54,847
"Bear Island knows no king
but the King in the North,

573
00:36:55,082 --> 00:36:57,116
whose name is Stark."

574
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:59,151
That amuses you?

575
00:37:00,687 --> 00:37:03,622
I apologize, Your Grace.

576
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:07,893
Northerners can be a
bit like the free folk.

577
00:37:08,228 --> 00:37:11,197
- Loyal to their own.
- I know.

578
00:37:11,531 --> 00:37:13,466
My brother Robert went on often and loudly

579
00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:15,767
about how difficult it was to control them.

580
00:37:18,037 --> 00:37:19,771
Even with your father's help.

581
00:37:23,009 --> 00:37:26,511
Tonight, the Night's Watch
elect a new Lord Commander.

582
00:37:26,779 --> 00:37:28,446
Ser Alliser Thorne is going to win.

583
00:37:28,748 --> 00:37:30,982
- Most likely.
- Unpleasant man.

584
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:33,551
He thinks you're a traitor.

585
00:37:34,052 --> 00:37:36,488
What's your life going to be like here
at the Wall with Thorne in command?

586
00:37:36,722 --> 00:37:38,289
Unpleasant, I expect.

587
00:37:38,591 --> 00:37:41,259
Your bravery made him look weak.

588
00:37:41,527 --> 00:37:43,361
He'll punish you for it.

589
00:37:43,629 --> 00:37:45,062
I don't punish men for bravery.

590
00:37:45,264 --> 00:37:47,031
I reward them.

591
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:49,800
I don't doubt it, Your Grace.

592
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:51,869
But I'm a brother of the Night's Watch.

593
00:37:52,237 --> 00:37:54,337
I pledged them my life, my honor, my sword.

594
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:56,973
I don't know what I have left to give you.

595
00:37:57,241 --> 00:37:59,042
You can give me the North.

596
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:01,210
I can't.

597
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:05,214
Even if I wanted to, I'm a bastard,

598
00:38:05,415 --> 00:38:06,382
a Snow.

599
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:09,585
Kneel before me. Lay your sword at my feet.

600
00:38:09,986 --> 00:38:12,855
Pledge me your service and
you'll rise again as Jon Stark,

601
00:38:13,089 --> 00:38:14,890
Lord of Winterfell.

602
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:22,498
He'll make you a Stark
with the stroke of a pen?

603
00:38:22,832 --> 00:38:26,135
It's the first thing I
ever remember wanting.

604
00:38:26,469 --> 00:38:29,304
I'd daydream that my
father would ask the king

605
00:38:29,773 --> 00:38:32,454
and just like that, I would never
be the bastard of Winterfell again.

606
00:38:32,475 --> 00:38:34,609
You deserve this. You do.

607
00:38:34,911 --> 00:38:37,312
I couldn't be happier for you.

608
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:39,815
I'm going to refuse him.

609
00:38:41,617 --> 00:38:45,187
But you'd be Lord of Winterfell.

610
00:38:45,488 --> 00:38:47,622
I swore a vow to the Night's Watch.

611
00:38:47,956 --> 00:38:49,436
If I don't take my own word seriously,

612
00:38:49,792 --> 00:38:52,026
what sort of Lord of Winterfell would I be?

613
00:38:57,032 --> 00:38:59,934
Crowded. You'd think we
were serving venison stew.

614
00:39:07,209 --> 00:39:11,545
Does anyone wish to speak for candidates

615
00:39:11,814 --> 00:39:14,548
before we cast our tokens

616
00:39:14,817 --> 00:39:18,919
for the 998th Lord Commander

617
00:39:19,153 --> 00:39:20,621
of the Night's Watch?

618
00:39:23,124 --> 00:39:24,991
Ser Alliser Thorne is not just a knight,

619
00:39:25,293 --> 00:39:26,694
he's a man of true nobility.

620
00:39:27,128 --> 00:39:29,730
He was acting commander when
the Wall came under attack

621
00:39:30,164 --> 00:39:32,724
- and led us to victory against the wildlings.
- Hear, hear.

622
00:39:32,834 --> 00:39:34,234
He's a veteran of 100 battles

623
00:39:34,702 --> 00:39:37,303
and has been a defender of the Watch
and the Wall almost all of his life.

624
00:39:37,504 --> 00:39:38,872
Aye.

625
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,640
He's the only true choice.

626
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:48,115
Ser Denys Mallister
joined the Watch as a boy

627
00:39:48,515 --> 00:39:51,016
and has served loyally
longer than any other ranger.

628
00:39:51,318 --> 00:39:53,786
Through 10 winters he served.

629
00:39:54,087 --> 00:39:55,622
As commander of the Shadow Tower,

630
00:39:55,889 --> 00:39:57,423
he kept the wildlings away.

631
00:39:57,691 --> 00:39:59,058
We could do no better.

632
00:40:03,764 --> 00:40:05,497
If there is no one else,

633
00:40:05,766 --> 00:40:07,199
we will begin the voting.

634
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,102
The triangular tokens count

635
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:12,772
for Ser Alliser Thorne.

636
00:40:13,106 --> 00:40:16,742
The square tokens for Ser Denys Mallister.

637
00:40:17,077 --> 00:40:19,879
- Each brother will...
- Maester Aemon.

638
00:40:21,114 --> 00:40:24,015
Samwell Tarly. Go on.

639
00:40:25,518 --> 00:40:27,886
Sam the Slayer.

640
00:40:28,288 --> 00:40:30,722
Another wildling lover just
like his friend Jon Snow.

641
00:40:31,023 --> 00:40:32,857
How's your lady love, Slayer?

642
00:40:33,192 --> 00:40:35,594
Her name is Gilly.

643
00:40:35,928 --> 00:40:37,496
Brother Slynt knows her quite well.

644
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:40,731
They cowered together in the larder
during the battle for the Wall.

645
00:40:41,033 --> 00:40:42,566
Lies!

646
00:40:42,802 --> 00:40:45,469
A wildling girl, a baby,

647
00:40:45,704 --> 00:40:47,172
and Lord Janos.

648
00:40:47,539 --> 00:40:49,941
I found him there after the battle was over

649
00:40:50,242 --> 00:40:51,442
in a puddle of his own making.

650
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:58,382
Whilst Lord Janos was hiding

651
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:00,851
with the women and children,

652
00:41:01,085 --> 00:41:03,220
Jon Snow was leading.

653
00:41:03,555 --> 00:41:05,790
Ser Alliser fought bravely, it is true.

654
00:41:06,124 --> 00:41:08,559
And when he was wounded,
it was Jon who saved us.

655
00:41:08,893 --> 00:41:10,661
He took charge of the Wall's defense.

656
00:41:10,962 --> 00:41:12,796
He killed the Magnar of the Thenns.

657
00:41:13,131 --> 00:41:15,432
He went north to deal with Mance Rayder

658
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,468
knowing it almost certainly
meant his own death.

659
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:24,541
Before that,

660
00:41:24,909 --> 00:41:27,744
he led the mission to avenge
Lord Commander Mormont.

661
00:41:29,513 --> 00:41:32,148
Mormont himself chose
Jon to be his steward.

662
00:41:32,583 --> 00:41:36,018
He saw something in Jon and
now we've all seen it, too.

663
00:41:36,253 --> 00:41:38,888
He may be young,

664
00:41:39,189 --> 00:41:41,123
but he's the commander we turned to

665
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:42,692
when the night was darkest.

666
00:41:51,034 --> 00:41:54,036
I can't argue with any of that.

667
00:41:55,272 --> 00:41:57,473
But who does Jon Snow want to command?

668
00:41:57,674 --> 00:42:00,909
Night's Watch

669
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:02,711
or the wildlings?

670
00:42:03,045 --> 00:42:06,548
Everyone knows he loved a wildling girl

671
00:42:06,883 --> 00:42:08,550
and spoke with Mance Rayder many times.

672
00:42:09,018 --> 00:42:12,320
What would have happened in that
tent between those two old friends

673
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:14,656
if Stannis's army hadn't come along?

674
00:42:15,057 --> 00:42:19,361
We all saw him put the
King-beyond-the-Wall out of his misery.

675
00:42:19,862 --> 00:42:23,331
Do you want to choose a man who has
fought the wildlings all his life

676
00:42:23,632 --> 00:42:25,733
or a man who makes love to them?

677
00:42:33,542 --> 00:42:35,042
It is time.

678
00:43:21,121 --> 00:43:24,057
It appears to be a tie, Maester.

679
00:43:44,744 --> 00:43:47,880
Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow!

680
00:44:19,411 --> 00:44:22,179
You. You.

681
00:44:25,283 --> 00:44:28,052
What have you got there?

682
00:44:29,921 --> 00:44:32,423
- I said...
- Turn around and go.

683
00:44:34,859 --> 00:44:37,428
Turn around and go.

684
00:44:37,695 --> 00:44:39,196
That's a nice little sword.

685
00:44:39,498 --> 00:44:41,832
Worth 100 pieces, a sword like that.

686
00:44:43,968 --> 00:44:46,202
Nothing's worth anything to dead men.

687
00:44:48,873 --> 00:44:50,206
Come on.

688
00:44:50,441 --> 00:44:52,142
Quickly, go! Go!

689
00:45:04,955 --> 00:45:06,856
Who are you?

690
00:45:07,158 --> 00:45:08,558
Why were they scared of you?

691
00:45:08,792 --> 00:45:10,960
You lost this.

692
00:45:22,138 --> 00:45:24,106
You said there was no Jaqen H'ghar here.

693
00:45:24,307 --> 00:45:25,808
There isn't.

694
00:45:26,076 --> 00:45:28,177
A man is not Jaqen H'ghar.

695
00:45:30,513 --> 00:45:32,982
Well, who are you, then?

696
00:45:33,183 --> 00:45:34,951
No one.

697
00:45:35,251 --> 00:45:37,252
And that is who a girl must become.

698
00:46:49,089 --> 00:46:51,057
Why?

699
00:48:31,187 --> 00:48:33,489
Mhysa! Mhysa!

700
00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:35,358
Mhysa! Mhysa!

701
00:48:55,111 --> 00:48:57,545
Mhysa! Mhysa!

702
00:48:57,713 --> 00:49:00,248
Mhysa!

703
00:49:00,583 --> 00:49:02,223
She should have cut off the traitor's head

704
00:49:02,385 --> 00:49:04,065
in the Great Pyramid and been done with it.

705
00:49:04,119 --> 00:49:06,388
Which is what I keep
telling her to do to you.

706
00:49:08,624 --> 00:49:11,793
Mhysa! Mhysa!

707
00:50:31,004 --> 00:50:32,338
Mhysa.

708
00:51:07,239 --> 00:51:09,407
Mhysa!

709
00:52:13,536 --> 00:52:15,697
I'll stand guard outside
your door tonight, Your Grace.

710
00:52:15,872 --> 00:52:17,606
We all guard tonight.

711
00:52:18,775 --> 00:52:20,241
Leave me.

712
00:53:13,028 --> 00:53:14,861
Drogon.
