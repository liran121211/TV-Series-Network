<i>( theme music playing )</i>

2
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:53,265
<i>( latch clanks )</i>

3
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:55,467
What are they doing
with the bodies?

4
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:56,868
Get back to work.

5
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,605
No. I've been here
for weeks.

6
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:00,973
I'm not scrubbing
one more corpse

7
00:04:00,975 --> 00:04:03,842
until you tell me
why I'm doing it.

8
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:05,611
You will know why.

9
00:04:05,613 --> 00:04:10,249
- When?
- When it's time,
not before.

10
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:11,483
Get back to work.

11
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:13,518
When do I get
to play the game?

12
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,620
Game?

13
00:04:14,622 --> 00:04:17,322
The game.
The Game of Faces.

14
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:20,559
You tried already.
You failed.

15
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:22,527
I didn't even know
I was playing.

16
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:24,997
Who are you?

17
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:26,865
No one.

18
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:29,268
Get back to work.

19
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:29,901
Who are you?

20
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:34,306
What are you doing here?
How did you get here?

21
00:04:34,642 --> 00:04:38,777
I'm from Westeros
just like you.

22
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,748
Daughter of a lord
just like you.

23
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,816
Except I was
an only child.

24
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:48,320
Heir to his fortune.

25
00:04:48,322 --> 00:04:50,389
My mother died.

26
00:04:50,391 --> 00:04:52,924
My father remarried
and his new wife

27
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:54,960
gave birth to a girl.

28
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:59,965
My stepmother
didn't want any rivals
for her precious daughter,

29
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:02,734
so she tried
to kill me with poison.

30
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:04,436
I found out.

31
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:07,572
Sought help from
the Faceless Men.

32
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:12,511
And my father
was widowed again.

33
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:16,548
I've been serving them
ever since.

34
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:30,929
Was that true
or a lie?

35
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,399
What?

36
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:36,501
Did you believe
every word I said?

37
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:39,805
<i>( footsteps approaching )</i>

38
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:43,442
Get back to work.

39
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,991
Jaqen:
<i>Who are you?</i>

40
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,636
Who are you?

41
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,009
Arya.

42
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:21,012
And where did you
come from?

43
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:22,848
<i>Westeros.</i>

44
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:27,986
My family home
is Winterfell.

45
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:31,390
I'm the youngest daughter
of a great lord,

46
00:06:31,392 --> 00:06:32,491
Eddard Stark.

47
00:06:32,493 --> 00:06:34,559
He died in battle.

48
00:06:35,496 --> 00:06:36,027
A lie.

49
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:40,165
After he was executed,
I fled the capital.

50
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,701
Had to kill a stable boy.

51
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:45,036
Drove my sword
through his back.

52
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:46,671
( gasps )

53
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:47,873
A lie.

54
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,541
I stabbed him
in the gut.

55
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:52,677
<i>I tried to find</i>
<i>my mother and brother,</i>

56
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:53,812
<i>but I never did.</i>

57
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:57,115
<i>They were murdered</i>
<i>by Walder Frey.</i>

58
00:06:57,117 --> 00:07:00,519
An outlaw kidnapped me,
a man called Polliver.

59
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:01,753
( winces )

60
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:04,956
A man called the Hound.
Sandor Clegane.

61
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,492
He tried to sell me,
but was wounded in a fight.

62
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:09,528
He begged me to kill him,
but I wouldn't.

63
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,663
I left him
in the mountains to die.

64
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:14,933
I wanted him to suffer.
I hated him.

65
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,637
I hated him.

66
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:22,641
That's not a lie!

67
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:25,110
A girl lies to me,

68
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:28,747
to the Many-Faced God,
to herself.

69
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:31,683
Does she truly
want to be no one?

70
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:33,652
Yes.

71
00:07:33,654 --> 00:07:35,921
( whimpers )

72
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:41,493
I'm not playing
this stupid game anymore!

73
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:44,095
We never stop playing.

74
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:09,154
So, those villages
we were supposed to find?

75
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,823
We can't live on
berries and roots.

76
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,159
I can.

77
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:16,027
You're not hungry?

78
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:17,596
Of course
I'm hungry.

79
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:20,165
You're an awful
travelling companion,
do you know that?

80
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,801
Possibly the least
charming man I've ever met.

81
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:23,902
I'm not your travelling
companion.

82
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:28,139
We are travelling together
in each other's company,
therefore--

83
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:29,641
Do you ever shut up?

84
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:33,044
I sailed
from King's Landing
to Pentos in a crate

85
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:36,147
<i>without ever</i>
<i>saying a word.</i>

86
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:38,016
Why?

87
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:44,089
It never occurred to you
to ask why until now?

88
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:47,559
You never wondered
why Tyrion Lannister

89
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:49,928
decided to visit
a brothel in Volantis?

90
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:54,099
I'm sure you
visited many brothels
in many cities.

91
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:57,936
I killed my father.

92
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:03,875
He wanted to execute me
for a crime I didn't commit.

93
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:08,780
And he was fucking
the woman I loved.

94
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:19,991
As miserable
as you are, Mormont,

95
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:21,793
at least your father
was a good man.

96
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:23,628
What do you know
about my father?

97
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:27,098
I met him.
I visited the Wall.

98
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,935
When I asked him
about his men,

99
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:32,070
he knew all their stories,
every one of them.

100
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:36,007
He actually cared
about the people
under his command.

101
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:39,210
How do they put it
in the Watch?

102
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:42,948
"We shall never see
his like again."

103
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:56,094
Oh, you didn't know.

104
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:04,603
I'm sorry.
I am.

105
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:08,273
How?

106
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:11,710
I only know
what I heard.

107
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:12,143
How?

108
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:15,614
<i>He was leading</i>
<i>an expedition beyond</i>
<i>the Wall.</i>

109
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:18,283
There was a mutiny.

110
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:21,353
He was murdered
by his own men.

111
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:35,266
We better keep moving.

112
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:54,019
<i>( girl coughing )</i>

113
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:13,038
( labored breathing )

114
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:25,984
Valar morghulis.

115
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:28,386
Valar dohaeris.

116
00:11:29,256 --> 00:11:31,122
I have nowhere
else to go.

117
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:35,160
I've taken her
to every healer
in Braavos.

118
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:38,963
I've spent
every penny I had.

119
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,234
( labored breathing )

120
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:46,438
She suffers every day
of her life.

121
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,075
I just want it to end.

122
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:19,437
It hurts.

123
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:22,107
I know.

124
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:26,211
Don't be afraid.

125
00:12:26,213 --> 00:12:29,881
I used to be like you.

126
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:32,250
I was sick.

127
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,487
I was dying.

128
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:42,127
But my father
never gave up on me.

129
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:46,431
He loved me

130
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,199
more than anything
in the world,

131
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:51,236
just like your father
loves you.

132
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:54,072
So he brought me here.

133
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:57,809
My father prayed
to the Many-Faced God.

134
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:02,013
And I drank the water
from his fountain.

135
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:05,116
It healed me.

136
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:11,156
<i>( bowl scrapes )</i>

137
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:20,298
I've devoted my life
to him now.

138
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:23,935
You don't want
to hurt anymore?

139
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:27,872
Drink.

140
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:14,138
Jaqen:
<i>Is a girl ready?</i>

141
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:18,576
To give up her ears,
her nose, her tongue?

142
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:22,246
<i>Her hopes and dreams,</i>
<i>her loves and hates?</i>

143
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:26,017
All that makes a girl
who she is?

144
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,220
Forever?

145
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:33,725
No.

146
00:16:33,727 --> 00:16:37,996
A girl is not ready
to become no one.

147
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:46,137
But she is ready
to become someone else.

148
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:02,387
Why Daenerys?
Why is she worth
all this?

149
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:06,624
As I recall,
the Mormonts fought
against the Targaryens

150
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:08,593
during Robert's
Rebellion.

151
00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:10,695
Do you believe
in anything?

152
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,063
I believe
in lots of things.

153
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:14,565
In something greater
than ourselves, I mean.

154
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:16,167
The gods, destiny.

155
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:20,338
Do you believe there's
a plan for this world?

156
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,507
No.

157
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:23,474
Neither did I.

158
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:25,610
I was a cynic
just like you.

159
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:29,080
Then I saw a girl
step into a great fire

160
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:30,114
with three stone eggs.

161
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:33,785
When the fire burned out,
I thought I'd find her
blackened bones.

162
00:17:33,787 --> 00:17:37,555
Instead, I saw her,
Daenerys,

163
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:42,660
alive and unhurt,
holding her baby dragons.

164
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:47,665
Have you ever heard
baby dragons singing?

165
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:48,666
No.

166
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:52,170
It's hard to be
a cynic after that.

167
00:17:53,106 --> 00:17:55,773
Doesn't mean she's going
to be a great queen.

168
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:57,341
<i>No, it doesn't.</i>

169
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:59,577
The Targaryens
are famously insane.

170
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:02,513
What if she
conquers the world?
Then what?

171
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:04,749
1,000 years of peace
and prosperity?

172
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:07,652
First we have
to conquer the world.

173
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:08,519
We?

174
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:10,588
All right, let's assume
your dreams come true.

175
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:14,258
<i>She's ecstatic when you</i>
<i>bring her this enemy dwarf.</i>

176
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,562
<i>She hacks off my head</i>
<i>and restores your position.</i>

177
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:19,430
You command her army,
sail to Westeros,

178
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:23,267
defeat all your enemies
and watch her climb
those steps

179
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:24,469
and sit on
the Iron Throne.

180
00:18:24,471 --> 00:18:27,305
Hurrah.
Long live the queen.
Then what?

181
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:28,139
Then she rules.

182
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:31,275
So a woman who has not
spent a single day
of her adult life

183
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:34,378
in Westeros becomes
the ruler of Westeros?
That's justice?

184
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,114
- She's the rightful heir.
- Why?

185
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:41,619
Because her father,
who burned living men
for amusement, was the king?

186
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:46,524
- That's a slave ship.
- Why are they anchored?

187
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:48,326
They probably
came ashore for--

188
00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:51,629
-<i> ( swords scraping )</i>
- Man:<i> Water.</i>

189
00:18:58,438 --> 00:19:01,439
- ( grunts )
- ( man laughs )

190
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:04,909
Got a lot of fight
in you, huh?

191
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:07,211
( grunts )

192
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:09,847
( chuckles )

193
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:14,585
Salt mines?

194
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:18,256
Yeah, that
or a galley slave.

195
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:20,158
<i>He looks strong enough.</i>

196
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,194
What about the dwarf?

197
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:25,363
Worthless.

198
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:27,231
Cut his throat.

199
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:29,734
Wait. Wait.
Wait, wait, wait!
Let's discuss this.

200
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:32,170
And then chop off
his cock.

201
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:33,471
We'll sell it
for a fortune.

202
00:19:33,473 --> 00:19:35,940
A dwarf's cock
has magic powers.

203
00:19:35,942 --> 00:19:38,309
Wait! Wait!

204
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:39,277
Wait, wait, wait!

205
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:41,913
You can't just hand
a dry cock to a merchant

206
00:19:41,915 --> 00:19:43,514
and expect him
to pay for it.

207
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,216
He has to know
it came from a dwarf.

208
00:19:45,218 --> 00:19:48,786
And how could he know
unless he sees the dwarf?

209
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:51,255
It will be
a dwarf-sized cock.

210
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:53,457
Guess again.

211
00:19:57,197 --> 00:20:00,965
The dwarf lives
until we find
a cock merchant.

212
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:03,634
( exhales )

213
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:11,475
Queen Daenerys
has outlawed slavery.

214
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:14,712
We're bound for Volantis,
not Slaver's Bay.

215
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:18,216
Besides, she reopened
the fighting pits.

216
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:20,952
I've never heard of free men
fighting in the pits.

217
00:20:20,954 --> 00:20:23,454
Tyrion:
<i>The fighting pits</i>
<i>in Meereen?</i>

218
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:25,823
You're in luck, then.
You're about to be rich.

219
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:30,995
You are looking at one
of the great warriors
in the Seven Kingdoms.

220
00:20:30,997 --> 00:20:32,797
( laughs )

221
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:33,831
Him.

222
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:37,802
Him?
He's got to be
60 years old.

223
00:20:37,804 --> 00:20:40,438
Sure, he's a bit
long in the tooth,

224
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,640
a bit withered,
been in the sun too long.

225
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:46,911
We can all see that.
But he is a veteran
of 100 battles.

226
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:49,880
They wrote songs
about him.

227
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:57,855
That true?

228
00:21:02,462 --> 00:21:04,996
He won the tournament
at Lannisport.

229
00:21:04,998 --> 00:21:08,733
Unseating Ser Jaime
Lannister himself.

230
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:12,036
- ( laughs )
- The Kingslayer.

231
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:15,706
Jousting.
You're talking
about jousting.

232
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,508
A fancy game
for fancy lads.

233
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:20,611
The men who fight
in the pits of Meereen
will swallow him whole.

234
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:24,548
I killed
a Dothraki bloodrider
in single combat.

235
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:35,826
Liar.

236
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:38,663
It's no lie.
His name was Qotho.

237
00:21:38,665 --> 00:21:41,365
He was bloodrider
to Khal Drogo.

238
00:21:41,367 --> 00:21:45,836
Take me to Slaver's Bay,
put a sword in my hand,

239
00:21:45,838 --> 00:21:47,905
I'll prove my worth.

240
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,746
( laughing )

241
00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:59,050
-<i> ( seagulls screeching )</i>
-<i> ( bell ringing )</i>

242
00:21:59,052 --> 00:22:02,820
For my children.
Money.

243
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:08,492
Lord Baelish.

244
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:10,695
Yes?

245
00:22:11,597 --> 00:22:14,031
Lancel Lannister.

246
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:17,535
Brother Lancel.

247
00:22:17,537 --> 00:22:19,070
We abandon
our family names.

248
00:22:19,072 --> 00:22:20,738
Quite a family
to abandon.

249
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,974
The city has changed
since you were here last.

250
00:22:23,976 --> 00:22:26,344
We flooded the gutters
with wine,

251
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:28,679
smashed the false idols,

252
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:31,615
and set the godless
on the run.

253
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:33,451
Well done.

254
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:41,125
I'm here
on urgent business
for the Queen Mother.

255
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:44,995
Should I send word
that I'll be delayed?

256
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:49,467
Step carefully,
Lord Baelish.

257
00:22:49,469 --> 00:22:52,503
You'll find there's little
tolerance for flesh peddlers

258
00:22:52,505 --> 00:22:53,571
in the new King's Landing.

259
00:22:53,573 --> 00:22:56,574
We both peddle fantasies,
Brother Lancel.

260
00:22:56,576 --> 00:22:59,910
Mine just happen
to be entertaining.

261
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:11,889
Do you think it's wise,
Your Grace,

262
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,557
arresting the heir
to Highgarden?

263
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:16,026
The Faith arrested
the heir to Highgarden.

264
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:19,997
Of course,
and the Faith were
armed on your orders.

265
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:21,031
The king's orders.

266
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:23,467
Is the king to blame
for Ser Loras's perversion?

267
00:23:23,469 --> 00:23:25,603
House Tyrell
won't tolerate
this insult.

268
00:23:25,605 --> 00:23:28,572
House Tyrell
won't tolerate it?

269
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,808
I'm the insulted party,
Lord Baelish.

270
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:32,510
Ser Loras
was promised to me.

271
00:23:32,512 --> 00:23:34,145
Instead he chose
the company of boys.

272
00:23:34,147 --> 00:23:37,748
One's choice of companion
is a curious thing.

273
00:23:40,052 --> 00:23:41,952
Most curious.

274
00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:45,790
Lysa Arryn,
for instance.

275
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:48,459
Thoroughly
repellant woman.

276
00:23:49,562 --> 00:23:51,028
Forgive me.

277
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,097
I know you're still
in mourning.

278
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:56,700
Lysa was a good woman.

279
00:23:56,702 --> 00:23:57,535
A kind woman.

280
00:23:57,537 --> 00:24:01,005
<i>She was neither</i>
<i>of those things.</i>
<i>We both know it.</i>

281
00:24:01,007 --> 00:24:02,706
Still, I pity her son.

282
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:04,942
How fortunate
the young Lord
of the Vale

283
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:07,545
<i>has a new father</i>
<i>to counsel him.</i>

284
00:24:07,547 --> 00:24:09,113
I know how hard
it can be

285
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:11,081
to lose
both your parents
at such a young age.

286
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:16,120
If war comes to Westeros,
will the Knights of the Vale
fight for their king?

287
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:19,557
Young Lord Robin
heeds my advice.

288
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:23,194
And I have always counseled
loyalty to the throne.

289
00:24:23,196 --> 00:24:25,162
Good.

290
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:31,535
If there's
nothing else.

291
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:33,070
There is another matter,
Your Grace.

292
00:24:33,072 --> 00:24:36,040
Something so urgent
I couldn't trust the words
to a raven.

293
00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:39,477
You once charged me
with finding Arya Stark.

294
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:42,246
To my shame,
I failed you.

295
00:24:42,248 --> 00:24:45,249
But I have found
Sansa Stark.

296
00:24:46,052 --> 00:24:49,854
Alive and well
and home again

297
00:24:49,856 --> 00:24:51,489
living at Winterfell.

298
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:53,591
That's not possible.

299
00:24:53,593 --> 00:24:56,560
My sources
are well placed.

300
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:58,729
They tell me Roose Bolton

301
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:01,131
plans to marry her
to his son Ramsay,

302
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:03,634
a bastard recently
legitimized by King Tommen.

303
00:25:03,636 --> 00:25:07,538
Roose Bolton
is Warden of the North
by the grace of my father.

304
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:12,877
Indeed, his reward
for stabbing his own
king in the heart.

305
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:15,513
We were fools
to trust a turncloak.

306
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:17,915
Marrying his son
to the last of the Starks

307
00:25:17,917 --> 00:25:19,650
gives him more legitimacy
in the North

308
00:25:19,652 --> 00:25:21,819
than an alliance with
a hated southern house.

309
00:25:21,821 --> 00:25:25,055
I will skin him
and his bastard

310
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:27,057
like that wretch
on their bloody sigil.

311
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:29,627
I would
counsel patience,
Your Grace.

312
00:25:29,629 --> 00:25:31,061
Patience?

313
00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:32,696
Sansa helped
murder my son.

314
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:33,898
Roose Bolton
is a traitor.

315
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,933
Stannis Baratheon
is also a traitor,

316
00:25:35,935 --> 00:25:37,868
marching with his army
on Winterfell.

317
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,904
Let Stannis
and Roose battle.

318
00:25:39,906 --> 00:25:41,939
Let the enemies
of the throne slaughter
each other.

319
00:25:41,941 --> 00:25:46,210
And when they're done,
seize Winterfell from
whichever thief survives.

320
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:48,812
Winterfell is 1,000 miles
away from here.

321
00:25:48,814 --> 00:25:50,948
The weather has already
begun to turn.

322
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:53,717
That is why it is critical
to strike soon

323
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:57,154
while the victor
still licks his wounds.

324
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,957
Surely your Uncle Kevan
could muster a force.

325
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:04,228
My Uncle Kevan
has all the courage
of a kitchen mouse.

326
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,062
Ser Jaime, then.

327
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:08,098
<i>Jaime's away</i>
<i>on a sensitive</i>
<i>diplomatic mission.</i>

328
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,101
I have no idea
when he'll be back.

329
00:26:11,103 --> 00:26:12,803
<i>Perhaps I can help.</i>

330
00:26:12,805 --> 00:26:16,307
The Knights of the Vale
are some of the best
fighters in Westeros,

331
00:26:16,309 --> 00:26:19,043
trained to battle
in the ice and the snow.

332
00:26:19,045 --> 00:26:21,612
Forgive me,
Lord Baelish,

333
00:26:21,614 --> 00:26:23,881
you have a reputation
as a moneylender

334
00:26:23,883 --> 00:26:26,350
and a brothel keeper,
not a military man.

335
00:26:26,352 --> 00:26:28,752
You wouldn't risk
a single Lannister soldier

336
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:32,323
or a single coin
from the royal treasury.

337
00:26:32,325 --> 00:26:34,224
What do you have to lose?

338
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:36,093
A brothel keeper?

339
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:37,361
And if you succeed?

340
00:26:37,363 --> 00:26:40,297
Name me
Warden of the North.

341
00:26:43,903 --> 00:26:47,304
I'll speak to the king
this evening,

342
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:49,073
have him issue
a royal decree.

343
00:26:49,075 --> 00:26:52,376
I'll not rest
until the lion flies
over Winterfell.

344
00:26:52,378 --> 00:26:54,712
And I'll know
you're a man of your word

345
00:26:54,714 --> 00:26:58,382
when I see Sansa Stark's
head on a spike.

346
00:26:58,384 --> 00:27:00,384
As I said...

347
00:27:00,386 --> 00:27:02,853
I live to serve.

348
00:27:07,693 --> 00:27:11,395
I'm going
to ask him tomorrow.

349
00:27:12,098 --> 00:27:14,098
- What if he says no?
- He won't.

350
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,667
We've waited
long enough.

351
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:19,336
I want you
to be my wife.

352
00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:21,672
Now.

353
00:27:22,341 --> 00:27:23,073
What is it?

354
00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:27,177
Do you want to marry me
because our families
arranged it?

355
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:29,279
Or do you--

356
00:27:36,255 --> 00:27:39,156
We can't.
Not yet.

357
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:39,823
Why not?

358
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:42,059
You know why not.
Someone will see.

359
00:27:42,061 --> 00:27:44,395
You are going
to be my wife.

360
00:27:44,397 --> 00:27:47,898
I am going to be
your husband.

361
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:51,402
We're allowed
to walk through
the gardens together.

362
00:27:51,404 --> 00:27:55,339
How many other girls
have you walked through
these gardens?

363
00:27:56,075 --> 00:27:58,876
I like the way
your eyes go squinty
when you're jealous.

364
00:27:58,878 --> 00:28:02,880
They do not go squinty
and you didn't answer
the question.

365
00:28:02,882 --> 00:28:05,416
Doran:
They make
a lovely couple.

366
00:28:05,418 --> 00:28:08,385
A Lannister
and a Martell.

367
00:28:08,387 --> 00:28:12,256
<i>They have no idea</i>
<i>how dangerous that is.</i>

368
00:28:12,258 --> 00:28:14,692
We must protect them.

369
00:28:14,694 --> 00:28:17,027
Yes, my prince.

370
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:21,799
You haven't had to use
that axe of yours
in a long time.

371
00:28:22,902 --> 00:28:24,768
I hope you remember how.

372
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:27,838
I remember how.

373
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:33,043
Bronn:
<i>♪ The Dornishman's wife</i>
<i>was as fair as the sun ♪</i>

374
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:38,415
♪ And her kisses
were warmer than spring ♪

375
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:40,350
♪ The Dornishman's
blade ♪

376
00:28:40,352 --> 00:28:42,486
♪ It was made
of black steel ♪

377
00:28:42,488 --> 00:28:46,890
♪ And its kiss
was a terrible thing ♪

378
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:50,494
♪ The Dornishman's wife
would sing as she bathed ♪

379
00:28:50,496 --> 00:28:55,499
- ♪ In a voice that
was sweet as a peach-- ♪
- All right, that's enough.

380
00:28:55,501 --> 00:28:57,801
I'm coming
to the best part.

381
00:28:57,803 --> 00:28:59,103
We're trying
to blend in.

382
00:28:59,105 --> 00:29:01,472
Don't want everyone
in Dorne to hear
your accent.

383
00:29:01,474 --> 00:29:03,874
This song really is
all about the ending.

384
00:29:03,876 --> 00:29:06,510
It can wait.
There.

385
00:29:09,315 --> 00:29:10,481
That's the Water Gardens.

386
00:29:10,483 --> 00:29:14,118
Bronn:
<i>And once we've got</i>
<i>the princess, then what?</i>

387
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,286
( sighs )

388
00:29:16,288 --> 00:29:18,956
I like to improvise.

389
00:29:18,958 --> 00:29:21,992
That explains
the golden hand.

390
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:45,883
Ellaria:
Unbowed. Unbent.
Unbroken.

391
00:29:47,086 --> 00:29:48,085
For Oberyn.

392
00:29:48,087 --> 00:29:50,354
All:
For Oberyn.

393
00:30:29,061 --> 00:30:32,196
Well, she's made
herself at home.

394
00:30:37,536 --> 00:30:40,170
Myrcella.

395
00:30:42,308 --> 00:30:44,408
Uncle Jaime?

396
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:45,509
I--

397
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:48,345
I don't understand.
What are you doing here?

398
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:49,880
Let's speak in private.

399
00:30:49,882 --> 00:30:53,317
- I am Trystane Martell.
- Trystane is my intended.

400
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:56,119
Excellent.
Good to meet you.

401
00:30:56,121 --> 00:30:57,888
We weren't expecting you,
Lord Jaime.

402
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:01,625
Why don't you let them
have some time alone, son?

403
00:31:05,464 --> 00:31:08,365
Let's not do
something stupid.

404
00:31:11,136 --> 00:31:11,902
( grunts )

405
00:31:11,904 --> 00:31:13,971
- ( shrieks )
- That was something stupid.

406
00:31:13,973 --> 00:31:15,205
We have to go,
Myrcella, now.

407
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:18,108
- You hurt him!
- He'll be fine, I promise.

408
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:20,010
But we have to--

409
00:31:20,012 --> 00:31:22,613
( grunts )

410
00:31:23,616 --> 00:31:25,582
Oh, for fuck's sake.

411
00:31:25,584 --> 00:31:27,985
( shouting )

412
00:31:27,987 --> 00:31:30,153
( whip cracks )

413
00:32:07,493 --> 00:32:09,159
Take her!

414
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:12,930
- You're coming with me.
- I don't want to.

415
00:32:12,932 --> 00:32:15,499
I wasn't asking,
princess.

416
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:18,702
( screams )

417
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:25,175
- Ah!
- Drop your weapons!

418
00:32:32,584 --> 00:32:35,085
Obara:
<i>I am Obara Sand.</i>

419
00:32:35,087 --> 00:32:37,120
Daughter of Oberyn Martell.

420
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:41,024
I fight for Dorne.
Who do you fight for?

421
00:32:41,026 --> 00:32:43,393
Drop your weapons.

422
00:32:59,578 --> 00:33:04,681
When you were whole,
it would have been
a good fight.

423
00:33:07,386 --> 00:33:09,486
<i>( sword clatters )</i>

424
00:33:14,293 --> 00:33:17,027
You fight pretty good
for a little girl.

425
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:20,030
( shouting )

426
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:40,450
- ( horses neighing )
-<i> ( seagulls screeching )</i>

427
00:33:44,056 --> 00:33:46,223
Halt!

428
00:33:47,426 --> 00:33:51,461
Oh, you can smell the shit
from five miles away.

429
00:33:51,463 --> 00:33:54,097
Well, why have we stopped?
Go on.

430
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:57,167
( horses neighing )

431
00:33:57,436 --> 00:34:00,337
Rumors and gossip,
that's all they've got.

432
00:34:00,339 --> 00:34:01,571
It's theater,
nothing more.

433
00:34:01,573 --> 00:34:05,175
If they arrested
all the pillow biters
in King's Landing,

434
00:34:05,177 --> 00:34:08,445
there'd be no room
left in the dungeons
for anyone else.

435
00:34:08,447 --> 00:34:09,579
Everyone knew
about him and Renly.

436
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:14,151
Renly Baratheon shagged
half the stable boys in
the Seven Kingdoms.

437
00:34:14,153 --> 00:34:16,119
Everyone knew,
no one cared.

438
00:34:16,121 --> 00:34:17,454
But he was
the king's brother.

439
00:34:17,456 --> 00:34:19,356
And Loras
is the queen's brother.

440
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:21,491
No, no, no, no.
This is unacceptable.

441
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:23,693
- Cersei's behind it.
- Yeah, of course she is.

442
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:26,630
She wants
to drag our name
through the dirt,

443
00:34:26,632 --> 00:34:28,265
put us in our place.

444
00:34:28,267 --> 00:34:30,333
Get some rest, dear.
You look appalling.

445
00:34:30,335 --> 00:34:33,136
Let me deal
with Cersei Lannister.

446
00:34:33,138 --> 00:34:35,172
( tapping )

447
00:34:38,544 --> 00:34:42,446
Your Grace,
I have travelled
a long way.

448
00:34:42,448 --> 00:34:45,415
You must be exhausted.

449
00:34:46,351 --> 00:34:49,453
Put the pen down, dear.
We both know you're not
writing anything.

450
00:34:49,455 --> 00:34:53,156
Ah, yes.
The famously tart-tongued
Queen of Thorns.

451
00:34:53,158 --> 00:34:56,860
And the famous tart
Queen Cersei.

452
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:00,864
I beg your pardon?

453
00:35:00,866 --> 00:35:04,801
I know you're behind
this absurd incarceration
of my grandson.

454
00:35:04,803 --> 00:35:07,637
If you apologize
for that comment,
perhaps I'll--

455
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:11,675
You'll get your apology
when I get Loras.

456
00:35:12,244 --> 00:35:14,111
I was as shocked
as anyone

457
00:35:14,113 --> 00:35:16,680
when the Faith
arrested Ser Loras.

458
00:35:16,682 --> 00:35:19,382
I have no love
for these fanatics,

459
00:35:19,384 --> 00:35:22,719
but what can
a Queen Mother do?

460
00:35:22,721 --> 00:35:24,855
Has the crown
suddenly stopped needing

461
00:35:24,857 --> 00:35:28,792
the troops,
gold, and wheat
my house supplies?

462
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:30,427
I can assure you,

463
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:32,496
our alliance with
House Tyrell remains--

464
00:35:32,498 --> 00:35:34,164
Do you expect
the alliance to continue

465
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:37,601
after you've thrown
our future into prison?

466
00:35:37,603 --> 00:35:39,636
As I said,

467
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,905
I didn't imprison anyone.

468
00:35:41,907 --> 00:35:43,773
As for your
veiled threats--

469
00:35:43,775 --> 00:35:45,342
What veil?

470
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:46,343
( sighs )

471
00:35:46,345 --> 00:35:50,714
The Lannister-Tyrell
alliance brought peace
to a war-torn country.

472
00:35:50,716 --> 00:35:55,685
Do you really want to see
the Seven Kingdoms slide
back into warfare?

473
00:35:58,257 --> 00:35:59,589
I didn't trust
your father.

474
00:35:59,591 --> 00:36:02,292
<i>I didn't</i>
<i>particularly like him.</i>

475
00:36:02,294 --> 00:36:05,395
<i>But I respected him.</i>
<i>He was no fool.</i>

476
00:36:05,397 --> 00:36:09,766
He understood
that sometimes we must
work with our rivals

477
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:11,234
rather than destroy them.

478
00:36:11,236 --> 00:36:14,271
House Lannister
has no rival.

479
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:19,342
The High Septon has called
for an inquest, not a trial.

480
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:20,844
Just a small hearing
to determine

481
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:24,281
whether the charges
against Loras have merit,

482
00:36:24,283 --> 00:36:25,448
which I'm sure they don't.

483
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:30,487
Loras will be freed,
our happy alliance
will continue...

484
00:36:30,489 --> 00:36:34,925
and we'll forget
this unfortunate
conversation ever happened.

485
00:36:36,195 --> 00:36:38,395
Good day, Lady Olenna.

486
00:36:53,478 --> 00:36:56,379
<i>( door opens, closes )</i>

487
00:36:56,381 --> 00:37:00,684
You are aware of the rumors
concerning you and Renly?

488
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,986
I don't pay attention
to rumors.

489
00:37:02,988 --> 00:37:06,389
<i>You were said</i>
<i>to be despondent</i>
<i>when he died.</i>

490
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:10,660
Witnesses state
that you refused
to leave his bedside

491
00:37:10,662 --> 00:37:13,263
even as Stannis's army
closed in.

492
00:37:13,265 --> 00:37:17,234
He was my friend.
He was my king.

493
00:37:17,236 --> 00:37:19,402
Wasn't Joffrey your king?

494
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:21,972
<i>He was anointed</i>
<i>by the Seven, not Renly.</i>

495
00:37:21,974 --> 00:37:28,245
I was wrong to support
Renly's claim, I know that.

496
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:30,547
But I was forgiven
by Joffrey.

497
00:37:30,549 --> 00:37:33,350
I fought for him
at the Battle
of Blackwater.

498
00:37:33,352 --> 00:37:36,853
Yes, wearing
Renly's armor.

499
00:37:36,855 --> 00:37:38,922
Why does it matter
what I wore?

500
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:42,492
Do you deny all
the charges against you?

501
00:37:42,494 --> 00:37:44,394
Fornication.

502
00:37:44,396 --> 00:37:46,529
<i>Buggery.</i>
<i>Blasphemy.</i>

503
00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:47,731
Of course I deny them.

504
00:37:47,733 --> 00:37:50,600
You never lay
with Renly Baratheon?

505
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:52,402
Never.

506
00:37:52,404 --> 00:37:54,738
<i>Nor any other man?</i>

507
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,573
Never.

508
00:37:58,343 --> 00:38:01,578
That will be all,
Ser Loras.

509
00:38:07,753 --> 00:38:10,620
Well, I think that's
quite enough of that.

510
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:13,657
The Faith calls
Queen Margaery forward.

511
00:38:13,659 --> 00:38:15,392
You call me forward?

512
00:38:15,394 --> 00:38:17,861
Yes, we have some
questions for you.

513
00:38:17,863 --> 00:38:21,665
- I am the queen.
- You are.

514
00:38:21,667 --> 00:38:24,367
And according
to the law of the Seven,

515
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:26,770
neither kings
nor queens are exempt

516
00:38:26,772 --> 00:38:30,473
from testimony
at a holy inquest.

517
00:38:47,092 --> 00:38:51,761
How do you
respond to these charges
against your brother?

518
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:52,962
They are lies.

519
00:38:52,964 --> 00:38:54,764
- All of them?
- All of them.

520
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:57,767
High Sparrow:
<i>Queen Margaery,</i>

521
00:38:57,769 --> 00:38:59,102
<i>in the presence</i>
<i>of the gods,</i>

522
00:38:59,104 --> 00:39:01,705
do you swear
that your brother
is innocent

523
00:39:01,707 --> 00:39:03,673
of these charges
against him

524
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:05,608
to the best
of your knowledge?

525
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:07,977
Yes, I swear it.

526
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:11,581
Thank you,
Your Grace.

527
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:38,541
Do you know this man?

528
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:41,411
Yes, very well.

529
00:39:41,413 --> 00:39:44,614
<i>He is Ser Loras Tyrell,</i>
<i>heir to Highgarden.</i>

530
00:39:44,616 --> 00:39:47,150
How did you
come to meet?

531
00:39:47,152 --> 00:39:49,819
Olyvar:
<i>I squired for him.</i>

532
00:39:49,821 --> 00:39:51,154
He took a liking to me.

533
00:39:51,156 --> 00:39:54,858
He summoned me
to his chamber
the first day we met.

534
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:59,529
And what occurred
in his chamber?

535
00:39:59,531 --> 00:40:04,467
We engaged
in intimate relations.

536
00:40:04,469 --> 00:40:06,069
You lay with him?

537
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:07,771
That night
and many others.

538
00:40:07,773 --> 00:40:10,774
Liar.
He's a liar.

539
00:40:10,976 --> 00:40:13,977
Is there anyone else
who can support your claim?

540
00:40:13,979 --> 00:40:15,912
Yes.

541
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:18,615
Yes, Queen Margaery.

542
00:40:18,617 --> 00:40:22,152
<i>She walked in on us once</i>
<i>not long ago.</i>

543
00:40:22,154 --> 00:40:24,521
She didn't seem
surprised.

544
00:40:24,523 --> 00:40:27,891
This testimony is an insult
to a great house.

545
00:40:27,893 --> 00:40:31,895
Why should the Faith
or anyone else take
the word of a squire

546
00:40:31,897 --> 00:40:33,163
over the heir
to Highgarden?

547
00:40:33,165 --> 00:40:35,832
Olyvar:
<i>He has a birthmark,</i>
<i>Your Grace.</i>

548
00:40:35,834 --> 00:40:38,468
<i>Quite high on his thigh.</i>

549
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:42,105
Wine-colored and roughly
the shape of Dorne.

550
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:44,707
No! Liar!

551
00:40:44,709 --> 00:40:45,909
( grunting )

552
00:40:45,911 --> 00:40:49,579
What are you doing?
Let us pass.

553
00:40:49,581 --> 00:40:52,749
The Faith is satisfied
there is enough evidence

554
00:40:52,751 --> 00:40:54,818
to bring a formal trial

555
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,953
<i>for Ser Loras</i>

556
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:59,088
and Queen Margaery.

557
00:40:59,090 --> 00:40:59,756
What?

558
00:40:59,758 --> 00:41:01,825
Bearing false witness
before the gods

559
00:41:01,827 --> 00:41:05,028
<i>is as grave a sin</i>
<i>as any, my lady.</i>

560
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:06,596
Take her.

561
00:41:06,598 --> 00:41:09,699
Margaery:
<i>No. Tommen.</i>

562
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:11,868
Tommen!

563
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:14,637
You can't do this.
I am the queen.

564
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:16,906
Tommen!
Tommen!

565
00:41:16,908 --> 00:41:19,676
<i>I am your queen.</i>
<i>How dare you?</i>

566
00:41:19,678 --> 00:41:21,211
<i>Take your hands off me!</i>

567
00:41:21,213 --> 00:41:24,547
<i>( shouting )</i>
<i>Tommen!</i>

568
00:41:37,195 --> 00:41:39,662
<i>( knocks on door )</i>

569
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:42,765
<i>( wind whistling )</i>

570
00:41:47,205 --> 00:41:48,705
What do you want?

571
00:41:48,707 --> 00:41:52,041
Lord Ramsay
sent me to draw you
a bath, my lady.

572
00:41:52,043 --> 00:41:54,677
You want to be
clean and fresh

573
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:57,280
for your new husband,
don't you?

574
00:42:13,765 --> 00:42:15,999
You're so beautiful,

575
00:42:16,001 --> 00:42:19,068
but you need
to keep him happy.

576
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:23,606
Ramsay gets
bored easily.

577
00:42:23,608 --> 00:42:26,209
You don't want
to end up like--

578
00:42:27,746 --> 00:42:30,647
well, like the others.

579
00:42:30,649 --> 00:42:32,715
What others?

580
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:34,884
Myranda:
I shouldn't gossip.

581
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:37,754
Oh, it's good to see
the red again.

582
00:42:37,756 --> 00:42:39,923
No point hiding anymore.

583
00:42:39,925 --> 00:42:41,190
What others?

584
00:42:41,192 --> 00:42:43,860
Let's see,
there was Kyra

585
00:42:43,862 --> 00:42:45,562
the blacksmith's
daughter.

586
00:42:45,564 --> 00:42:48,131
She was tall like you,
lovely figure.

587
00:42:48,133 --> 00:42:52,735
But she talked
and talked and talked

588
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:56,573
and Ramsay grew
tired of that.

589
00:42:56,575 --> 00:42:58,775
Then there was Violet.

590
00:42:58,777 --> 00:43:01,644
She had gorgeous
blonde hair.

591
00:43:01,646 --> 00:43:04,280
But she got pregnant.

592
00:43:04,282 --> 00:43:07,717
And, well,
that was boring.

593
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:11,120
Then Tansy.

594
00:43:11,122 --> 00:43:12,622
Such a sweet girl.

595
00:43:12,624 --> 00:43:17,894
Of course, sweet girls
get a bit dull

596
00:43:17,896 --> 00:43:19,696
after a while,
don't they?

597
00:43:19,698 --> 00:43:22,865
Ramsay let me come
with him on that hunt.

598
00:43:22,867 --> 00:43:24,033
Hunt?

599
00:43:24,035 --> 00:43:26,002
Mmm.

600
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:32,008
Have you ever seen
a body after the dogs
have been at it?

601
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:34,243
Not so pretty.

602
00:43:35,647 --> 00:43:38,648
But, well, it's your
wedding day.

603
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:41,951
Why am I talking
about such things?

604
00:43:43,755 --> 00:43:45,888
What was your name again?

605
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:47,757
Myranda.

606
00:43:48,893 --> 00:43:52,629
And how long have you
loved him, Myranda?

607
00:43:54,633 --> 00:43:58,334
Did you imagine
that he would be with you
forever, is that it?

608
00:43:58,336 --> 00:44:01,237
And I came along
and ruined it.

609
00:44:03,775 --> 00:44:07,043
I'm Sansa Stark
of Winterfell.

610
00:44:07,045 --> 00:44:12,281
This is my home
and you can't frighten me.

611
00:44:17,255 --> 00:44:20,990
Are you done with
your bath, my lady?

612
00:44:21,226 --> 00:44:23,926
Go. I can finish
on my own.

613
00:44:47,786 --> 00:44:50,953
-<i> ( knocks on door )</i>
- Yes?

614
00:44:57,262 --> 00:45:03,032
I've come to escort you
to the godswood, my lady.

615
00:45:06,471 --> 00:45:10,840
If you please, my lady,
will you take my arm?

616
00:45:10,842 --> 00:45:12,408
No.

617
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:16,245
Lord Ramsay, he said
I'm to take your arm.

618
00:45:16,247 --> 00:45:18,214
I'm not touching you.

619
00:45:19,984 --> 00:45:21,818
Please.

620
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:24,087
He'll punish me.

621
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:28,725
You think I care
what he does to you?

622
00:46:44,936 --> 00:46:48,571
Who comes before
the old gods this night?

623
00:46:49,207 --> 00:46:52,909
Theon:
Sansa of the House Stark

624
00:46:52,911 --> 00:46:56,112
comes here
to be wed.

625
00:46:57,315 --> 00:47:01,117
A woman grown,
trueborn and noble.

626
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:06,422
She comes to beg
the blessings
of the gods.

627
00:47:07,826 --> 00:47:10,359
Who comes to claim her?

628
00:47:18,837 --> 00:47:21,470
Ramsay of House Bolton.

629
00:47:21,472 --> 00:47:25,007
<i>Heir to the Dreadfort</i>
<i>and Winterfell.</i>

630
00:47:27,145 --> 00:47:29,946
Who gives her?

631
00:47:31,316 --> 00:47:37,353
Theon of House Greyjoy,
who was--

632
00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:43,359
who was her father's ward.

633
00:47:44,629 --> 00:47:49,198
Lady Sansa,
will you take this man?

634
00:48:18,496 --> 00:48:20,663
I take this man.

635
00:48:51,529 --> 00:48:54,430
Are you pleased,
my lady?

636
00:48:56,434 --> 00:49:00,236
Good. I want you
to be happy.

637
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:07,576
( sighs )

638
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:13,149
My father said
you're still a virgin.

639
00:49:18,256 --> 00:49:21,357
- Uh, yes.
- Why?

640
00:49:24,329 --> 00:49:27,563
Why are you
still a virgin?

641
00:49:27,565 --> 00:49:30,566
Afraid of dwarves?
( chuckles )

642
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:33,502
Lord-- Lord Tyrion
was kind.

643
00:49:33,504 --> 00:49:37,740
He was gentle.
He never touched me.

644
00:49:38,743 --> 00:49:40,543
You're not lying to me?

645
00:49:40,545 --> 00:49:41,610
No, my lord.

646
00:49:41,612 --> 00:49:44,347
Lying to your husband
on his wedding night,

647
00:49:44,349 --> 00:49:49,051
that would be a bad way
to start a marriage.

648
00:49:53,257 --> 00:49:56,292
We're man and wife now.

649
00:49:56,294 --> 00:49:58,694
We should be honest
with each other.

650
00:49:58,696 --> 00:50:01,030
Don't you think?

651
00:50:01,699 --> 00:50:03,766
Yes.

652
00:50:13,644 --> 00:50:15,644
Good.

653
00:50:17,448 --> 00:50:19,715
Take off your clothes.

654
00:50:23,287 --> 00:50:25,354
Oh, no, no, no.

655
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:28,557
You stay here, Reek.

656
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:31,193
You watch.

657
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:45,474
Do I need to ask
a second time?

658
00:50:45,476 --> 00:50:48,444
I hate asking
a second time.

659
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,273
Reek...

660
00:51:17,275 --> 00:51:20,776
I told you to watch.

661
00:51:25,616 --> 00:51:29,652
You've known Sansa
since she was a girl.

662
00:51:30,321 --> 00:51:32,721
Now watch her
become a woman.

663
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:42,164
( gasps )

664
00:51:46,337 --> 00:51:48,671
<i>( clothes ripping )</i>

665
00:51:48,673 --> 00:51:50,339
