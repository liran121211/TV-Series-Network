1
00:02:38,844 --> 00:02:41,212
I'm so sorry, my queen.

2
00:02:41,263 --> 00:02:43,097
He was a good man.

3
00:02:43,132 --> 00:02:46,517
"Barristan the Bold"
they called him.

4
00:02:46,552 --> 00:02:49,589
He crossed a continent
to serve me.

5
00:02:49,623 --> 00:02:52,125
He was a loyal friend.

6
00:02:53,877 --> 00:02:56,296
And he died in an alley,

7
00:02:56,347 --> 00:02:59,382
butchered by cowards
who hide behind masks.

8
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:04,637
We could pull back
to the pyramid district,

9
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:07,974
<i>secure it, and use it as a
base from which to operate.</i>

10
00:03:07,976 --> 00:03:11,144
Then we clean the city out,

11
00:03:11,195 --> 00:03:15,048
<i>neighborhood by neighborhood,
street by street,</i>

12
00:03:15,082 --> 00:03:17,350
until the rats
have nowhere left to hide.

13
00:03:21,205 --> 00:03:23,823
I prefer
your earlier suggestion.

14
00:03:23,825 --> 00:03:27,660
Round up the leaders of each of Meereen's
great families and bring them to me.

15
00:03:29,163 --> 00:03:32,915
But I'm the leader of my family.

16
00:03:35,053 --> 00:03:36,474
No, Your Grace!

17
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,555
I had nothing to do with this.

18
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,507
Your Grace!

19
00:06:12,409 --> 00:06:14,160
Don't want to overfeed them.

20
00:06:17,915 --> 00:06:19,832
Tomorrow perhaps.

21
00:06:56,003 --> 00:06:59,288
"And though Daenerys maintains
her grip on Slaver's Bay,

22
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:02,758
forces rise against her
from within and without.

23
00:07:02,793 --> 00:07:04,877
She refuses to leave
until the freedom

24
00:07:04,928 --> 00:07:07,713
of the former slaves
is secure."

25
00:07:09,049 --> 00:07:10,800
She sounds like quite a woman.

26
00:07:10,851 --> 00:07:12,718
And she's alone,

27
00:07:12,769 --> 00:07:14,353
under siege,

28
00:07:14,388 --> 00:07:17,773
no family to guide her
or protect her.

29
00:07:17,808 --> 00:07:21,894
Her last relation
thousands of miles away,

30
00:07:21,929 --> 00:07:25,481
useless, dying.

31
00:07:27,034 --> 00:07:29,735
Don't say that, Maester Aemon.

32
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:34,824
A Targaryen alone in the world

33
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:37,410
is a terrible thing.

34
00:07:40,297 --> 00:07:42,131
Maester Aemon.

35
00:07:42,165 --> 00:07:44,417
Lord Commander.

36
00:07:44,468 --> 00:07:47,420
Sam, I'd like to speak
to the maester alone.

37
00:08:02,769 --> 00:08:04,437
How are you feeling?

38
00:08:04,488 --> 00:08:07,106
Oh, like
a hundred-year-old man

39
00:08:07,157 --> 00:08:09,575
slowly freezing to death.

40
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:16,749
I need your advice.

41
00:08:16,783 --> 00:08:19,335
There's something I want
to do, something I...

42
00:08:19,369 --> 00:08:20,786
have to do.

43
00:08:20,837 --> 00:08:23,239
But it'll divide
the Night's Watch.

44
00:08:23,273 --> 00:08:24,875
Bitterly.

45
00:08:25,124 --> 00:08:27,629
Half the men will hate me
the moment I give the order.

46
00:08:28,336 --> 00:08:31,971
Half the men hate you
already, Lord Commander.

47
00:08:32,005 --> 00:08:34,056
Do it.

48
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,919
But you don't know what it is.

49
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,743
That doesn't matter.

50
00:08:37,778 --> 00:08:39,146
You do.

51
00:08:41,932 --> 00:08:45,985
You will find little joy
in your command.

52
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:48,571
But with luck,

53
00:08:48,605 --> 00:08:52,167
you will find the strength
to do what needs to be done.

54
00:08:54,182 --> 00:08:57,780
Kill the boy, Jon Snow.

55
00:08:57,831 --> 00:09:01,333
Winter is almost upon us.

56
00:09:01,368 --> 00:09:04,119
Kill the boy

57
00:09:04,171 --> 00:09:07,239
and let the man be born.

58
00:09:16,183 --> 00:09:18,684
Where are the rest
of the free folk now?

59
00:09:18,718 --> 00:09:20,519
Where have they gone?

60
00:09:24,925 --> 00:09:26,992
Who leads them?

61
00:09:27,027 --> 00:09:29,495
They followed Mance.

62
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:31,919
They won't follow anyone else.

63
00:09:34,712 --> 00:09:36,780
What about you?

64
00:09:38,183 --> 00:09:40,717
Hard to lead
when you're in chains.

65
00:09:44,305 --> 00:09:46,006
What if I unchained you?

66
00:09:46,057 --> 00:09:47,373
Why would you do that?

67
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:52,012
Because you are not my enemy.

68
00:09:52,063 --> 00:09:53,730
And I'm not yours.

69
00:09:53,765 --> 00:09:56,650
You sure seemed like my enemy
when you were killing my friends.

70
00:09:56,684 --> 00:09:59,436
For 8,000 years the Night's
Watch have sworn an oath

71
00:09:59,487 --> 00:10:02,487
to be the shield that
guards the realms of men.

72
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:06,660
And for 8,000 years we've
fallen short of that oath.

73
00:10:06,694 --> 00:10:09,780
You belong to the realms of men.

74
00:10:09,814 --> 00:10:11,782
All of you.

75
00:10:11,784 --> 00:10:14,618
And now everything
is going to change?

76
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,620
- It is.
- Why now?

77
00:10:16,671 --> 00:10:20,674
Because now I am Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

78
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:23,844
What would you have me do,

79
00:10:23,878 --> 00:10:26,296
Lord Commander?

80
00:10:27,966 --> 00:10:30,050
I'd have you go
north of the Wall.

81
00:10:30,101 --> 00:10:33,887
Gather the remaining free folk wherever
they are and bring them back here.

82
00:10:33,938 --> 00:10:37,474
I'll open the gates for
them and let them through.

83
00:10:37,525 --> 00:10:40,611
I'll find them lands to
settle south of the Wall.

84
00:10:40,645 --> 00:10:44,231
They won't kneel for you
and neither will I.

85
00:10:44,282 --> 00:10:47,150
I don't want them
to kneel for me.

86
00:10:47,152 --> 00:10:49,653
I want them to fight with
me when the time comes.

87
00:10:49,655 --> 00:10:52,456
The day I ask my people
to fight with the crows

88
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:55,409
is the day my people
cut my guts from my belly

89
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,493
and make me eat them.

90
00:10:56,544 --> 00:10:59,463
And how many of your
people can't fight?

91
00:10:59,497 --> 00:11:02,583
The women, the children,
the old, the sick--

92
00:11:02,634 --> 00:11:04,468
what happens to them?

93
00:11:04,502 --> 00:11:06,553
You're condemning them to death.

94
00:11:06,588 --> 00:11:10,374
Worse than death because you're
too proud to make peace.

95
00:11:13,811 --> 00:11:15,913
Or maybe you're not proud.

96
00:11:17,849 --> 00:11:19,433
Maybe you're just a coward.

97
00:11:26,357 --> 00:11:29,443
Easy thing to say
to a man in chains.

98
00:11:53,935 --> 00:11:55,602
Your people need a leader.

99
00:11:55,637 --> 00:11:58,889
And they need to get south of
the Wall before it's too late.

100
00:11:58,891 --> 00:12:01,024
We don't have much time
and they have less.

101
00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:03,977
The walkers are coming and
they'll hit your people first.

102
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:08,565
I'm not asking you to make
peace to save your skin.

103
00:12:08,616 --> 00:12:12,402
Make peace to save your people.

104
00:12:20,828 --> 00:12:23,080
Most of them are at Hardhome.

105
00:12:23,114 --> 00:12:24,414
You know where that is?

106
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:26,300
Up on Storrold's Point.

107
00:12:26,334 --> 00:12:28,502
I can give you 10 horses
and nine other men.

108
00:12:28,553 --> 00:12:30,433
You can get there in a week.

109
00:12:30,471 --> 00:12:32,089
We'll need ships.

110
00:12:33,558 --> 00:12:36,093
I'll talk to King Stannis
about lending you his fleet.

111
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,064
All right, then.

112
00:12:42,867 --> 00:12:45,102
You're coming with me.

113
00:12:46,003 --> 00:12:48,772
<i>You're the Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.</i>

114
00:12:48,823 --> 00:12:51,108
They need to hear it from you.

115
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,410
They need to know
the ships they are boarding

116
00:12:53,444 --> 00:12:55,662
won't be torched
in the middle of the sea.

117
00:12:55,697 --> 00:13:00,867
You come with me or I don't go.

118
00:13:08,794 --> 00:13:11,595
You'd bring wildlings here
through our gates?

119
00:13:11,629 --> 00:13:15,132
Men, women, and children will die
by the thousands if we do nothing.

120
00:13:15,183 --> 00:13:18,385
Let them die. We got our
own to worry about.

121
00:13:18,436 --> 00:13:21,388
Less enemies for us.

122
00:13:21,439 --> 00:13:23,140
Fewer.

123
00:13:23,191 --> 00:13:25,909
- What?
- Nothing.

124
00:13:25,943 --> 00:13:29,780
Look, well, there is
good farmland in the Gift.

125
00:13:29,814 --> 00:13:32,149
Land that no one uses now.

126
00:13:32,151 --> 00:13:34,201
A dozen abandoned villages.

127
00:13:34,235 --> 00:13:36,370
And why do you think the farmers
abandoned those villages?

128
00:13:36,404 --> 00:13:39,683
<i>Because the wildlings
raided them for years.</i>

129
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:41,253
Cut them down!

130
00:13:41,814 --> 00:13:43,496
Just like they did this boy's people.

131
00:13:44,148 --> 00:13:46,433
Aye!

132
00:13:46,484 --> 00:13:50,103
<i>We've been fighting
them for thousands of years.</i>

133
00:13:50,154 --> 00:13:52,188
They've slaughtered villages.

134
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,220
<i>They've slaughtered
our brothers.</i>

135
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,493
And we've slaughtered theirs.

136
00:13:58,029 --> 00:14:01,803
I will follow you
anywhere, you know that.

137
00:14:03,111 --> 00:14:05,868
- But they killed Grenn.
- Yes.

138
00:14:05,869 --> 00:14:07,936
- And they killed Pyp.
- Aye.

139
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:10,695
<i>They killed 50 of our brothers.</i>

140
00:14:10,815 --> 00:14:13,126
<i>I can't forget that.</i>

141
00:14:13,177 --> 00:14:14,295
I can't forgive it.

142
00:14:14,415 --> 00:14:16,538
You were at the Fist
of the First Men.

143
00:14:17,099 --> 00:14:19,802
If we abandon them,
you know what they become.

144
00:14:19,922 --> 00:14:21,962
<i>We can learn to live
with the wildlings</i>

145
00:14:22,082 --> 00:14:24,938
<i>or we can add them
to the army of the dead.</i>

146
00:14:24,972 --> 00:14:29,359
Whatever they are now,
they're better than that.

147
00:14:57,219 --> 00:14:59,087
Thank you.

148
00:14:59,138 --> 00:15:00,755
<i>Olly.</i>

149
00:15:02,525 --> 00:15:05,427
<i>If you have something
you want to say to me,</i>

150
00:15:05,429 --> 00:15:07,145
<i>say it.</i>

151
00:15:13,903 --> 00:15:15,937
It's all right.

152
00:15:17,356 --> 00:15:19,441
You don't mean it, do you?

153
00:15:21,077 --> 00:15:23,695
Telling the wildlings
you want to make peace.

154
00:15:23,746 --> 00:15:25,730
You're just doing it
to trick them.

155
00:15:25,765 --> 00:15:27,282
It's not a trick.

156
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:28,867
They burned my village.

157
00:15:28,918 --> 00:15:30,952
They put an arrow
through my father's head

158
00:15:30,954 --> 00:15:32,154
right in front of me.

159
00:15:32,274 --> 00:15:35,824
They butchered my mother,
everyone I ever knew.

160
00:15:43,582 --> 00:15:46,518
I know what it's like
to lose the people you love.

161
00:15:48,637 --> 00:15:50,939
I know this is hard for you.

162
00:15:52,475 --> 00:15:55,310
But winter is coming.

163
00:15:55,312 --> 00:15:58,847
We know what's coming with it.

164
00:15:58,881 --> 00:16:00,782
We can't face it alone.

165
00:16:06,205 --> 00:16:09,207
Will there be anything else
you need, Lord Commander?

166
00:16:12,445 --> 00:16:14,045
No.

167
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:49,898
She's far away
from the Lannisters.

168
00:16:50,766 --> 00:16:52,367
<i>This is her home.</i>

169
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,638
Maybe Lady Sansa is better off here.

170
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:01,275
Better off with the Boltons

171
00:17:01,309 --> 00:17:03,978
who murdered
her mother and brother?

172
00:17:12,571 --> 00:17:15,372
Sansa's in danger even
if she doesn't realize it.

173
00:17:29,471 --> 00:17:31,222
Thank you.

174
00:17:33,141 --> 00:17:35,422
You've lived here a long time?

175
00:17:36,678 --> 00:17:38,395
Aye.

176
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:41,148
Did you know Lord Eddard?

177
00:17:42,737 --> 00:17:45,352
I knew him

178
00:17:45,354 --> 00:17:47,905
and his father before him.

179
00:17:49,658 --> 00:17:52,026
The Starks are gone now.

180
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,861
Not all of them.

181
00:17:53,912 --> 00:17:56,697
<i>I know who's inside that castle.</i>

182
00:17:56,748 --> 00:17:58,616
Everyone knows.

183
00:17:58,667 --> 00:18:00,100
The Boltons.

184
00:18:00,135 --> 00:18:02,495
I'm not talking
about the Boltons.

185
00:18:03,402 --> 00:18:06,123
I need to get a message to her.

186
00:18:06,174 --> 00:18:08,008
To Sansa Stark.

187
00:18:10,078 --> 00:18:11,338
Who are you?

188
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:14,548
Someone who swore
to keep her safe.

189
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,350
Swore to who?

190
00:18:16,384 --> 00:18:18,552
Her mother.

191
00:18:18,587 --> 00:18:20,471
Her mother's dead.

192
00:18:20,522 --> 00:18:23,274
That doesn't release me
from an oath.

193
00:18:25,944 --> 00:18:28,896
I served Lady Catelyn.

194
00:18:28,898 --> 00:18:31,532
I serve her still.

195
00:18:33,034 --> 00:18:35,002
Who do you serve?

196
00:18:41,376 --> 00:18:43,494
<i>Come back here.</i>

197
00:18:47,198 --> 00:18:48,382
Myranda.

198
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,484
I saw you staring at her.

199
00:18:50,518 --> 00:18:52,219
I'm going to marry her.

200
00:18:52,253 --> 00:18:55,339
That will involve looking
at her from time to time.

201
00:18:58,927 --> 00:19:00,678
You said you'd marry me.

202
00:19:01,896 --> 00:19:03,597
And I meant it.

203
00:19:03,632 --> 00:19:05,733
When I was a bastard named Snow.

204
00:19:05,767 --> 00:19:08,018
<i>But I'm a Bolton now.</i>

205
00:19:08,069 --> 00:19:12,206
What I want is no longer
the primary consideration.

206
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,608
I'm furthering a dynasty.

207
00:19:17,612 --> 00:19:18,946
Do you think she's pretty?

208
00:19:18,997 --> 00:19:21,682
Of course I do.

209
00:19:21,716 --> 00:19:23,117
I'm not blind.

210
00:19:36,264 --> 00:19:38,515
You think she's pretty, too.

211
00:19:41,603 --> 00:19:43,804
I'm looking forward
to our wedding night.

212
00:19:43,855 --> 00:19:47,641
But don't worry, I'll have
plenty of time for you.

213
00:19:47,643 --> 00:19:50,227
Perhaps I'll marry, too.

214
00:19:55,116 --> 00:19:58,235
You're the kennel
master's daughter.

215
00:19:58,286 --> 00:20:01,488
Who are you going to marry,
the stable keeper's son?

216
00:20:07,712 --> 00:20:09,663
You're mine.

217
00:20:10,305 --> 00:20:12,716
You're not going anywhere.

218
00:20:12,751 --> 00:20:14,671
Unless I have to listen
to more of your jealousy.

219
00:20:14,787 --> 00:20:18,305
Jealousy bores me. You remember
what happens to people who bore me.

220
00:20:21,009 --> 00:20:24,928
You're not going to bore
me, are you, Myranda?

221
00:20:43,364 --> 00:20:44,948
Never.

222
00:21:11,776 --> 00:21:13,444
Beg pardon, my lady.

223
00:21:13,478 --> 00:21:15,813
I've come to refill
the wash basin.

224
00:21:15,864 --> 00:21:17,731
Oh, I don't need--

225
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,285
You still have
friends in the North.

226
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:22,948
If you're ever in trouble,

227
00:21:23,068 --> 00:21:26,957
light a candle in the highest
window of the broken tower.

228
00:21:27,899 --> 00:21:30,577
- But who--
- You're not alone.

229
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,584
I like your dress.

230
00:22:11,907 --> 00:22:13,754
Who made it for you?

231
00:22:13,788 --> 00:22:16,423
I made it myself.

232
00:22:16,457 --> 00:22:18,458
Really?

233
00:22:20,461 --> 00:22:22,179
Who-- who are you?

234
00:22:22,213 --> 00:22:25,264
I'm Myranda, the kennel
master's daughter.

235
00:22:28,686 --> 00:22:29,970
May I?

236
00:22:36,361 --> 00:22:38,111
Oh, wonderful.

237
00:22:38,146 --> 00:22:40,147
The stitching.

238
00:22:41,482 --> 00:22:43,584
- Who taught you?
- My mother.

239
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:48,705
I'm sorry for what
happened to her.

240
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,040
Thank you.

241
00:22:51,826 --> 00:22:53,994
It's good that she taught you.

242
00:22:53,996 --> 00:22:55,495
It was a gift.

243
00:22:55,547 --> 00:23:00,500
Now every time you wear
something you made,

244
00:23:00,502 --> 00:23:02,336
you can remember her.

245
00:23:02,338 --> 00:23:03,871
I'd rather have a mother.

246
00:23:03,905 --> 00:23:07,641
I know.
It's not the same.

247
00:23:07,675 --> 00:23:10,920
Still, it's good to remember.

248
00:23:11,144 --> 00:23:13,564
Remember the way things were.

249
00:23:15,316 --> 00:23:17,818
I almost forgot.

250
00:23:17,852 --> 00:23:20,687
There's something else

251
00:23:20,738 --> 00:23:23,106
<i>to help you remember.</i>

252
00:23:32,584 --> 00:23:35,035
Down there at the end.

253
00:23:36,371 --> 00:23:37,754
What is it?

254
00:23:37,789 --> 00:23:39,706
That would spoil the surprise.

255
00:23:40,796 --> 00:23:44,127
Go ahead, it's perfectly safe.

256
00:23:44,178 --> 00:23:46,346
You won't believe it
when you see it.

257
00:24:48,876 --> 00:24:50,243
Theon?

258
00:25:00,171 --> 00:25:02,539
You shouldn't be here.

259
00:25:22,643 --> 00:25:26,613
You smell particularly
ripe this evening.

260
00:25:28,936 --> 00:25:31,201
Pour me some wine.

261
00:25:55,343 --> 00:25:57,511
Do you have
something to tell me?

262
00:25:58,846 --> 00:26:00,158
No, my lord.

263
00:26:00,278 --> 00:26:02,182
Reek.

264
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,021
She saw me.

265
00:26:08,023 --> 00:26:09,523
Who?

266
00:26:09,574 --> 00:26:12,409
Sansa.
Lady Sansa.

267
00:26:12,443 --> 00:26:14,111
She came to the kennels.

268
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:16,557
She saw you?

269
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:18,809
Yes.
I'm sorry, master.

270
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,728
Forgive me.
I didn't think--

271
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:22,730
Come here.

272
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:33,791
You mustn't keep
secrets from me, Reek.

273
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:35,659
Get on your knees.

274
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:50,090
Give me your hand.

275
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:14,031
I forgive you.

276
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:28,345
I trust you find your
chamber suitable, my lady.

277
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,547
Yes, thank you, my lord.

278
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:32,383
Allow me.

279
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:37,805
Mother.

280
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,773
Thank you, Ramsay.

281
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:54,538
My lady, we are all a
family, we northerners.

282
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:57,992
Our blood ties go back
thousands of years.

283
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:01,011
So I'd like to drink
to our wedding.

284
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:04,415
May our happiness
spread from Moat Cailin

285
00:28:04,417 --> 00:28:05,582
to the Last Hearth.

286
00:28:05,634 --> 00:28:07,551
To your wedding.

287
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:09,503
To your wedding.

288
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:19,396
It must be difficult for you
being in a strange place.

289
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:22,266
This isn't a strange place.
This is my home.

290
00:28:22,268 --> 00:28:24,549
It's the people who are strange.

291
00:28:28,857 --> 00:28:30,658
You're right.

292
00:28:30,692 --> 00:28:32,242
Very strange.

293
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:37,081
More wine, please.

294
00:28:43,588 --> 00:28:46,307
<i>I heard you two had reunited.</i>

295
00:28:46,341 --> 00:28:49,376
A fitting place for it.

296
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:54,631
I like to imagine that
the last time you spoke

297
00:28:54,683 --> 00:28:56,633
was in this very room.

298
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:01,972
<i>Are you still angry with him</i>

299
00:29:02,023 --> 00:29:03,891
<i>after he...</i>

300
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:09,730
what he did?

301
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:12,116
Don't worry.

302
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,318
The North remembers.

303
00:29:15,704 --> 00:29:17,821
I punished him for it.

304
00:29:17,872 --> 00:29:20,240
He's not ironborn anymore.

305
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:23,494
Not Theon Greyjoy anymore.

306
00:29:23,496 --> 00:29:25,329
He's a new man.

307
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:29,800
A new person, anyway.

308
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:31,502
Aren't you, Reek?

309
00:29:31,504 --> 00:29:33,170
Yes, master.

310
00:29:33,221 --> 00:29:35,389
That's his
new name-- Reek.

311
00:29:35,423 --> 00:29:37,508
Why are you doing this?

312
00:29:39,427 --> 00:29:42,646
Because Reek has
something to say to you.

313
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,281
Don't you, Reek?

314
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:56,193
An apology.

315
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,169
Apologize to Lady Sansa
for what you did.

316
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:09,506
Apologize for murdering
her two brothers.

317
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,964
I'm sorry.

318
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:20,517
Look at her, Reek.

319
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:23,387
<i>An apology doesn't mean anything</i>

320
00:30:23,389 --> 00:30:25,989
<i>if you're not looking
the person in the eye.</i>

321
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:35,065
<i>- I'm sorry.
- Sorry about what?</i>

322
00:30:36,284 --> 00:30:38,068
For killing your brothers.

323
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:51,498
There, over and done with.

324
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:55,052
<i>Doesn't everyone
feel better? I do.</i>

325
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:58,005
That was getting very tense.

326
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,591
Whew.

327
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:06,563
You know what, my lady?

328
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:09,433
What with him having
murdered your brothers

329
00:31:09,484 --> 00:31:11,935
and the rest
of your family gone...

330
00:31:13,988 --> 00:31:18,158
Reek here is the nearest
thing to living kin

331
00:31:18,193 --> 00:31:20,194
that you have left.

332
00:31:21,529 --> 00:31:23,497
Reek.

333
00:31:23,531 --> 00:31:25,415
You will give away the bride.

334
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:31,755
Someone has to.
What better person?

335
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:33,257
Good? Good?

336
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:36,677
Yes, yes, very good.

337
00:31:36,711 --> 00:31:38,712
Wonderful.

338
00:31:40,239 --> 00:31:43,133
Walda and I have
some good news as well,

339
00:31:43,135 --> 00:31:44,935
since we're all together.

340
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:52,469
We're going to have a baby.

341
00:31:58,032 --> 00:31:59,867
I'm very happy for you.

342
00:31:59,901 --> 00:32:01,869
From the way she's carrying,

343
00:32:01,903 --> 00:32:04,788
Maester Wolkan says
it looks like a boy.

344
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:21,889
<i>How can you be sure?</i>

345
00:32:21,923 --> 00:32:24,141
Sure of what?

346
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:26,076
That she's pregnant.

347
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,145
I mean...

348
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:29,846
how can you tell?

349
00:32:29,848 --> 00:32:33,208
Maester Wolkan has assured
us beyond all doubt.

350
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:44,778
So how did you manage it?

351
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:46,663
Manage what?

352
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:49,032
Getting her pregnant.

353
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:51,134
I imagine you're familiar
with the procedure.

354
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:54,254
Of course, but how did you...

355
00:32:54,289 --> 00:32:55,294
find it?

356
00:32:55,414 --> 00:32:58,175
You disgraced yourself at dinner

357
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:00,544
parading that creature
before the Stark girl.

358
00:33:00,595 --> 00:33:03,180
And if it's a boy?

359
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:07,050
You're worried about
your position.

360
00:33:07,101 --> 00:33:09,186
My position is quite clear.

361
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:12,022
I'm your son

362
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:14,558
until a better
alternative comes along.

363
00:33:23,818 --> 00:33:25,986
You've never asked me
about your mother.

364
00:33:30,491 --> 00:33:32,909
Why would I?

365
00:33:32,911 --> 00:33:35,746
She had me, she died.

366
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:39,601
And here we are.

367
00:33:39,721 --> 00:33:41,958
She was a peasant girl.

368
00:33:42,367 --> 00:33:44,794
Pretty in a common sort of way.

369
00:33:44,796 --> 00:33:47,037
She was the miller's wife.

370
00:33:47,157 --> 00:33:50,514
Apparently they had married
without my knowledge or consent.

371
00:33:50,788 --> 00:33:52,496
So I had him hanged

372
00:33:52,616 --> 00:33:56,055
and I took her beneath the
tree where he was swaying.

373
00:33:56,106 --> 00:33:57,565
She fought me the whole time.

374
00:33:57,685 --> 00:34:00,359
She was lucky
I didn't hang her, too.

375
00:34:00,394 --> 00:34:02,556
<i>A year later
she came to my gates</i>

376
00:34:02,676 --> 00:34:04,538
<i>with a squalling baby
in her arms.</i>

377
00:34:04,658 --> 00:34:07,233
<i>A baby she claimed was mine.</i>

378
00:34:07,284 --> 00:34:08,877
I nearly had her whipped

379
00:34:08,997 --> 00:34:11,404
and the child
thrown in the river.

380
00:34:16,453 --> 00:34:18,294
But then I looked at you

381
00:34:18,328 --> 00:34:21,264
<i>and I saw then what I see now.</i>

382
00:34:21,298 --> 00:34:23,499
You are my son.

383
00:34:35,347 --> 00:34:38,333
Stannis Baratheon has
an army at Castle Black.

384
00:34:38,791 --> 00:34:41,576
But he won't stay for long.

385
00:34:41,578 --> 00:34:44,245
He wants the Iron Throne,

386
00:34:44,247 --> 00:34:47,738
and the road to King's Landing
comes right through Winterfell.

387
00:34:48,744 --> 00:34:51,775
He means to take the North.

388
00:34:53,444 --> 00:34:55,662
But the North is ours.

389
00:34:55,697 --> 00:34:57,831
It's yours and mine.

390
00:34:58,833 --> 00:35:01,451
Will you help me defeat him?

391
00:35:02,954 --> 00:35:04,788
Yes.

392
00:35:12,514 --> 00:35:14,965
Is this every book there is?

393
00:35:16,134 --> 00:35:17,885
Every book there is?

394
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:22,105
- In the world.
- Well, no.

395
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:26,143
There are thousands and
thousands of books out there.

396
00:35:26,145 --> 00:35:28,395
This library is rather
small, actually.

397
00:35:28,446 --> 00:35:30,113
Where you grew up,
were there more books?

398
00:35:30,148 --> 00:35:32,983
My father's not
the most literate man.

399
00:35:35,353 --> 00:35:38,989
They say the Citadel has the
largest library in the world.

400
00:35:38,991 --> 00:35:40,457
Where's that?

401
00:35:41,626 --> 00:35:44,144
The Citadel?

402
00:35:44,178 --> 00:35:45,913
In Oldtown.

403
00:35:52,362 --> 00:35:54,021
I'm sorry I don't know things.

404
00:35:54,141 --> 00:35:57,226
Gilly, look at me.

405
00:35:57,261 --> 00:36:01,180
<i>You know how to do a hundred
things I can never do.</i>

406
00:36:01,231 --> 00:36:03,483
You can build a fire
with wet wood.

407
00:36:03,517 --> 00:36:05,935
You can cook.
You can stitch a wound.

408
00:36:05,986 --> 00:36:08,688
I can wash the linens.
I can sweep the floor.

409
00:36:08,739 --> 00:36:12,075
- Well... - Why does the Citadel have
the biggest library?

410
00:36:12,109 --> 00:36:15,244
<i>It's where they train
the maesters.</i>

411
00:36:15,279 --> 00:36:16,813
Like Maester Aemon?

412
00:36:16,847 --> 00:36:19,615
I wanted to be one
when I was young.

413
00:36:22,169 --> 00:36:26,422
Instead, I became a man
of the Night's Watch.

414
00:36:28,963 --> 00:36:31,828
Far more adventure
up here anyway.

415
00:36:33,382 --> 00:36:35,515
I wouldn't have met you.

416
00:36:40,624 --> 00:36:43,306
Ah, Your Grace.

417
00:36:50,731 --> 00:36:52,982
You're Samwell Tarly?

418
00:36:52,984 --> 00:36:56,085
I am, Your Grace.

419
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,404
Your father is Randyll Tarly.

420
00:37:00,991 --> 00:37:03,993
He defeated my brother
at the Battle of Ashford.

421
00:37:05,245 --> 00:37:08,214
<i>Only battle Robert ever lost.</i>

422
00:37:08,248 --> 00:37:11,834
I told him he shouldn't go so far
west so soon, but he never listened.

423
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:17,056
<i>Fine soldier, your father.</i>

424
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:19,175
You don't look like a soldier.

425
00:37:20,394 --> 00:37:23,179
But I'm told you killed
a white walker.

426
00:37:23,181 --> 00:37:25,014
I did, Your Grace.

427
00:37:25,065 --> 00:37:26,315
<i>How?</i>

428
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:28,484
With a dagger
made of dragonglass.

429
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:29,512
Dragonglass?

430
00:37:29,736 --> 00:37:31,354
What the maesters call obsidian.

431
00:37:31,405 --> 00:37:33,689
I know what it is.
We have it in Dragonstone.

432
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,304
Why would obsidian
kill a walker?

433
00:37:35,424 --> 00:37:37,443
I don't know.

434
00:37:37,494 --> 00:37:39,335
I've been going through
all the old manuscripts

435
00:37:39,363 --> 00:37:41,614
hoping to find something,
and all I've learned

436
00:37:41,665 --> 00:37:44,569
is that the children of the forest
used to hunt with dragonglass.

437
00:37:44,689 --> 00:37:48,838
The Lady Melisandre told me
that death marches on the Wall.

438
00:37:51,792 --> 00:37:53,401
I've seen it, Your Grace.

439
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,378
Seen what?

440
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:58,281
The army of the dead.

441
00:37:58,315 --> 00:38:01,984
- And when they come--
- We have to know how to fight them.

442
00:38:05,756 --> 00:38:08,307
Keep reading, Samwell Tarly.

443
00:38:25,659 --> 00:38:27,460
It's time.

444
00:38:27,494 --> 00:38:29,745
Uh, Your Grace.

445
00:38:29,796 --> 00:38:32,298
Wouldn't it be better to wait?

446
00:38:32,332 --> 00:38:35,179
When Jon Snow returns with the wildlings,
we could have thousands more men.

447
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:36,770
If Jon Snow returns
with the wildlings.

448
00:38:36,783 --> 00:38:38,467
We can't wait that long.

449
00:38:38,502 --> 00:38:42,088
We have the advantage-- more men,
more horses, all fed and rested.

450
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:45,091
<i>But every day we wait, the
odds shift in Bolton's favor.</i>

451
00:38:45,142 --> 00:38:47,226
This could turn to winter
at any moment.

452
00:38:47,261 --> 00:38:49,061
We have to act now.
Give the order.

453
00:38:49,096 --> 00:38:50,596
We march at sunrise.

454
00:38:50,598 --> 00:38:52,348
I'll choose a dozen men to stay

455
00:38:52,399 --> 00:38:54,817
and guard the queen
and the princess.

456
00:38:54,851 --> 00:38:56,731
No need.
They're coming with us.

457
00:38:58,438 --> 00:39:00,439
It's a tough road ahead,
Your Grace.

458
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:03,242
- Won't they be safer--
- Here?

459
00:39:03,277 --> 00:39:06,946
Half these watchmen
are killers and rapists.

460
00:39:08,031 --> 00:39:09,916
No, they march with us.

461
00:39:13,086 --> 00:39:15,087
As you wish, Your Grace.

462
00:39:40,614 --> 00:39:43,316
<i>Do you think Father will
let me go down into the crypt?</i>

463
00:39:43,318 --> 00:39:44,958
Beg your pardon?

464
00:39:44,985 --> 00:39:46,736
At Winterfell.

465
00:39:46,787 --> 00:39:48,821
All the Kings in the North
are buried there.

466
00:39:48,823 --> 00:39:50,656
Bran the Builder
and King Dorren and--

467
00:39:50,658 --> 00:39:53,042
First things first.
It's a long march ahead.

468
00:39:53,076 --> 00:39:55,044
And then we have
to take the castle.

469
00:39:55,078 --> 00:39:56,495
Is there going to be a battle?

470
00:39:56,546 --> 00:39:58,998
Aye, princess, but you
won't be anywhere near--

471
00:39:59,049 --> 00:40:02,251
That's enough talk
of battle, Ser Davos.

472
00:40:02,302 --> 00:40:03,719
You'll scare the child.

473
00:40:03,754 --> 00:40:06,172
<i>Yes, my queen.</i>

474
00:40:08,558 --> 00:40:11,510
- I'm not scared.
- Well, I am.

475
00:40:11,595 --> 00:40:14,513
When the battle comes,
promise you'll protect me.

476
00:40:14,598 --> 00:40:16,649
I promise.

477
00:40:36,453 --> 00:40:39,872
I hope you know what you're
doing with these wildlings.

478
00:40:39,923 --> 00:40:42,291
I need those ships.

479
00:40:43,343 --> 00:40:46,512
You'll get them back,
I swear it.

480
00:40:48,048 --> 00:40:50,383
Have a safe journey, Your Grace.

481
00:40:51,385 --> 00:40:53,219
And thank you.

482
00:41:22,049 --> 00:41:23,883
<i>Mount up!</i>

483
00:41:23,917 --> 00:41:25,918
<i>Colors!</i>

484
00:42:15,469 --> 00:42:17,470
No.

485
00:42:17,472 --> 00:42:19,438
You're still too weak.

486
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:31,951
Ser Barristan?

487
00:42:57,744 --> 00:42:59,979
<i>Are you ashamed?</i>

488
00:43:01,515 --> 00:43:04,016
<i>You were ambushed, outnumbered.</i>

489
00:43:04,067 --> 00:43:05,985
<i>There was no way
you could have known.</i>

490
00:43:06,019 --> 00:43:08,070
This is not why.

491
00:43:10,524 --> 00:43:12,741
Wounded in war,

492
00:43:12,776 --> 00:43:16,111
there is no shame for this.

493
00:43:16,163 --> 00:43:18,280
I am ashamed

494
00:43:18,331 --> 00:43:20,866
because when the knife go in

495
00:43:20,917 --> 00:43:24,253
and I fall to the ground,

496
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:26,205
I am afraid.

497
00:43:27,757 --> 00:43:29,842
All men fear death.

498
00:43:29,876 --> 00:43:32,661
No, not death.

499
00:43:35,215 --> 00:43:37,883
I fear

500
00:43:37,934 --> 00:43:42,848
I never again see Missandei
from the Island of Naath.

501
00:44:18,808 --> 00:44:21,977
Now you have given the
Masters what they deserve.

502
00:44:22,012 --> 00:44:23,562
If I give everyone
what they deserve,

503
00:44:23,597 --> 00:44:25,764
I'll have no one left to rule.

504
00:44:25,766 --> 00:44:28,317
Ser Barristan counseled mercy

505
00:44:28,351 --> 00:44:31,032
when I took this city right
up to the morning he died.

506
00:44:31,071 --> 00:44:33,856
<i>Daario Naharis thinks I should
kill the former Masters</i>

507
00:44:33,907 --> 00:44:37,068
<i>and let the rest of the
city fend for itself.</i>

508
00:44:37,527 --> 00:44:39,278
What do you think?

509
00:44:40,747 --> 00:44:42,865
Your Grace, I think
that I am not fit

510
00:44:42,916 --> 00:44:45,284
to have an opinion
on these matters.

511
00:44:45,335 --> 00:44:47,786
You are as fit as anyone I know.

512
00:44:49,205 --> 00:44:51,457
You know why I'm here.

513
00:44:51,459 --> 00:44:54,543
And you know who will suffer the
most if this all falls apart.

514
00:44:54,594 --> 00:44:57,763
<i>So what do you think?</i>

515
00:44:59,966 --> 00:45:03,469
I can only tell you
what I have seen, Your Grace.

516
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,805
I have seen you listen
to your counselors.

517
00:45:08,525 --> 00:45:12,144
I have seen you lean on their
experience when your own was lacking

518
00:45:12,195 --> 00:45:15,247
and weigh the choices
they put before you.

519
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:19,952
And I have seen you
ignore your counselors...

520
00:45:22,822 --> 00:45:25,324
because there was
a better choice.

521
00:45:25,358 --> 00:45:27,710
One that only you could see.

522
00:45:44,427 --> 00:45:47,680
My-- my queen,
please do not do this.

523
00:45:47,682 --> 00:45:49,682
<i>What about "valar morghulis"?</i>

524
00:45:49,684 --> 00:45:52,267
I did not want to die a coward.

525
00:45:57,023 --> 00:45:59,658
Apparently I do not
want to die at all.

526
00:46:01,528 --> 00:46:03,996
It takes courage to admit fear.

527
00:46:05,365 --> 00:46:07,700
And to admit a mistake.

528
00:46:09,169 --> 00:46:11,787
I came here to tell you
that I was wrong.

529
00:46:14,674 --> 00:46:17,292
I was wrong and you were right.

530
00:46:19,262 --> 00:46:21,380
About tradition.

531
00:46:22,799 --> 00:46:25,634
About bringing the people
of this city together.

532
00:46:29,022 --> 00:46:31,223
I will reopen the fighting pits.

533
00:46:32,192 --> 00:46:33,776
To free men only.

534
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:38,030
Slavery will never return to
Meereen, not while I live.

535
00:46:38,064 --> 00:46:40,149
Yes, my queen.

536
00:46:43,536 --> 00:46:47,489
And in order to forge a lasting
bond with the Meereenese people,

537
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:50,325
I will marry the leader
of an ancient family.

538
00:46:52,579 --> 00:46:55,581
Thankfully a suitor
is already on his knees.

539
00:47:23,743 --> 00:47:25,527
Don't worry.

540
00:47:25,578 --> 00:47:29,031
I'll be fine. Nothing
broken, I don't think.

541
00:47:31,201 --> 00:47:33,001
Where are we now?

542
00:47:33,036 --> 00:47:35,120
Not the Rhoyne.

543
00:47:41,177 --> 00:47:43,846
Long, sullen silences

544
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:46,882
and an occasional
punch in the face.

545
00:47:48,685 --> 00:47:50,803
The Mormont way.

546
00:47:54,274 --> 00:47:57,025
Let's start over.

547
00:47:58,228 --> 00:48:00,646
I apologize for before.

548
00:48:00,648 --> 00:48:03,649
<i>My mouth sometimes
runs away from me.</i>

549
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:06,618
This doesn't have to be
an unpleasant trip.

550
00:48:11,407 --> 00:48:14,568
We're going to be spending a lot of
time together on the way to Meereen.

551
00:48:14,577 --> 00:48:15,961
We are.

552
00:48:17,797 --> 00:48:21,133
What would make our time
together truly enjoyable

553
00:48:21,167 --> 00:48:22,668
would be some wine.

554
00:48:23,503 --> 00:48:25,003
No wine.

555
00:48:27,674 --> 00:48:31,176
I am a person who drinks.

556
00:48:32,846 --> 00:48:35,180
People who drink
need to keep drinking.

557
00:48:35,231 --> 00:48:37,266
<i>Otherwise, they're not...</i>

558
00:48:44,691 --> 00:48:46,191
I know where we are.

559
00:48:46,242 --> 00:48:48,744
You're taking us
through Valyria.

560
00:48:48,778 --> 00:48:50,162
I am.

561
00:48:50,196 --> 00:48:52,364
Have you sailed
this route before?

562
00:48:52,415 --> 00:48:53,949
No.

563
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,951
You're going to bring
Daenerys a souvenir

564
00:48:56,002 --> 00:48:58,203
from her ancestral homeland
in case I'm not enough?

565
00:48:58,205 --> 00:49:00,789
I think you'll be plenty.

566
00:49:01,925 --> 00:49:04,009
<i>You know what they say.</i>

567
00:49:04,043 --> 00:49:07,262
The Doom still rules Valyria.

568
00:49:07,297 --> 00:49:10,215
What about the demons
and the flames?

569
00:49:11,384 --> 00:49:13,101
<i>Aren't you afraid of the Doom?</i>

570
00:49:13,136 --> 00:49:14,937
<i>No.</i>

571
00:49:14,971 --> 00:49:17,389
But pirates are.

572
00:49:18,274 --> 00:49:19,892
Oh.

573
00:49:22,812 --> 00:49:26,365
The Smoking Sea.

574
00:49:26,399 --> 00:49:28,367
How many centuries
before we learn

575
00:49:28,401 --> 00:49:30,785
how to build cities
like this again?

576
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:34,822
Thousands of years the Valyrians were

577
00:49:34,856 --> 00:49:37,665
the best in the world
at almost everything.

578
00:49:38,163 --> 00:49:40,661
And then...

579
00:49:40,695 --> 00:49:43,447
And then they weren't.

580
00:49:43,498 --> 00:49:45,115
And then they weren't.

581
00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:52,539
"They held each other close and
turned their backs upon the end.

582
00:49:52,591 --> 00:49:55,593
<i>The hills that split asunder</i>

583
00:49:55,627 --> 00:49:58,429
and the black
that ate the skies;

584
00:49:58,463 --> 00:50:00,160
The flames that shot
so high and hot

585
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:02,383
that even dragons burned;

586
00:50:02,434 --> 00:50:04,210
Would never be the final sights

587
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:06,971
that fell upon their eyes.

588
00:50:07,412 --> 00:50:09,123
A fly upon a wall,

589
00:50:09,709 --> 00:50:13,679
the waves the sea wind
whipped and churned--"

590
00:50:13,713 --> 00:50:16,632
"The city of a thousand years,

591
00:50:16,634 --> 00:50:18,550
and all that men had learned;

592
00:50:18,601 --> 00:50:22,054
The Doom consumed it all alike,

593
00:50:22,105 --> 00:50:24,806
and neither
of them turned."

594
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:29,895
I would clap.

595
00:50:34,951 --> 00:50:37,319
I suppose this is it, then.

596
00:50:38,488 --> 00:50:40,622
This is what remains.

597
00:51:20,279 --> 00:51:21,530
What was that?

598
00:51:28,087 --> 00:51:30,455
Stone Men!

599
00:51:30,506 --> 00:51:32,407
Don't let them touch you!

600
00:51:48,691 --> 00:51:50,392
Get behind!

601
00:51:52,779 --> 00:51:55,364
Mormont, cut me free!

602
00:51:55,398 --> 00:51:57,566
Mormont!

603
00:52:12,331 --> 00:52:14,249
Mormont!

604
00:52:14,251 --> 00:52:16,385
Mormont!

605
00:52:51,937 --> 00:52:53,988
Tyrion?

606
00:52:56,825 --> 00:52:59,327
Tyrion.

607
00:52:59,361 --> 00:53:01,029
Tyrion.

608
00:53:02,448 --> 00:53:04,449
Tyrion.

609
00:53:05,374 --> 00:53:07,752
You're all right.

610
00:53:17,296 --> 00:53:19,631
You're heavier than you look.

611
00:53:22,134 --> 00:53:24,469
Did any of them touch you?

612
00:53:27,223 --> 00:53:29,140
You?

613
00:53:34,113 --> 00:53:37,031
I've seen greyscale before,

614
00:53:37,066 --> 00:53:38,533
but nothing like that.

615
00:53:38,567 --> 00:53:41,486
I suppose that's why
they send them there.

616
00:53:43,489 --> 00:53:47,009
It'd be kinder to put daggers in
their hearts and be done with it.

617
00:53:50,913 --> 00:53:54,165
Thank you for saving me.

618
00:53:57,503 --> 00:53:59,671
Of course, I wouldn't
have needed saving

619
00:53:59,673 --> 00:54:01,954
if you hadn't kidnapped me
in the first place.

620
00:54:06,043 --> 00:54:07,862
So what now?

621
00:54:07,969 --> 00:54:10,053
We walk up the coast.

622
00:54:10,104 --> 00:54:11,939
With luck, we'll find
a fishing village.

623
00:54:11,973 --> 00:54:13,974
Maybe another boat.

624
00:54:13,976 --> 00:54:16,260
Without luck?

625
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:18,979
We've got a long walk
ahead of us.

626
00:54:20,899 --> 00:54:24,034
I'll get some wood for a fire.

627
00:54:24,068 --> 00:54:26,820
Try to get some rest, huh?

628
00:54:26,871 --> 00:54:29,606
That's the best idea
you've had all day.
