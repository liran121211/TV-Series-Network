1
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,849
Valar morghulis.

2
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,934
Valar dohaeris.

3
00:03:30,355 --> 00:03:33,057
I've been sweeping
this floor for days.

4
00:03:33,059 --> 00:03:34,492
Good.

5
00:03:34,526 --> 00:03:36,644
I didn't come here
to sweep floors.

6
00:03:36,695 --> 00:03:39,063
No?

7
00:03:39,065 --> 00:03:40,898
Why come, then?

8
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:44,068
You said I could be
your apprentice.

9
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,654
You said you'd teach me
how to be a Faceless Man.

10
00:03:46,705 --> 00:03:48,873
A man teaches a girl.

11
00:03:50,575 --> 00:03:52,510
Valar dohaeris.

12
00:03:52,544 --> 00:03:54,712
All men must serve.

13
00:03:54,746 --> 00:03:56,881
Faceless Men most of all.

14
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,085
I want to serve.

15
00:04:03,588 --> 00:04:05,890
A girl wants to serve herself.

16
00:04:05,924 --> 00:04:08,392
Here we serve
the Many-Faced God.

17
00:04:08,427 --> 00:04:09,927
To serve well,

18
00:04:09,929 --> 00:04:12,263
a girl must become no one.

19
00:04:12,265 --> 00:04:14,065
Which one's
the Many-Faced God?

20
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:18,018
I see the Stranger.
I see the Drowned God.

21
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,603
I see the weirwood face.

22
00:04:19,605 --> 00:04:21,972
There is only one god.

23
00:04:22,007 --> 00:04:24,442
A girl knows his name.

24
00:04:24,493 --> 00:04:26,544
And all men know his gift.

25
00:05:04,032 --> 00:05:06,233
Where are they taking him?

26
00:05:23,552 --> 00:05:28,222
Queen Margaery!
Queen Margaery!

27
00:05:33,178 --> 00:05:35,396
<i>Queen Margaery!</i>

28
00:05:37,682 --> 00:05:39,683
Queen Margaery!

29
00:05:39,685 --> 00:05:42,019
<i>Queen Margaery!</i>

30
00:05:46,441 --> 00:05:49,610
<i>-  I am his and he is mine.
-  I am hers and she is mine.</i>

31
00:05:49,661 --> 00:05:53,364
<i>From this day until
the end of my days.</i>

32
00:06:36,908 --> 00:06:38,826
Did I hurt you?

33
00:06:38,877 --> 00:06:41,078
No.
You were lovely.

34
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:44,248
- It all happened so fast.
- Yes.

35
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,217
I was scared maybe I hurt you.

36
00:06:46,251 --> 00:06:48,886
- It sounded like--
- No, no, no.

37
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,588
You're very sweet.

38
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:53,924
The sweetest king
who ever lived.

39
00:06:53,975 --> 00:06:57,311
This is all I want
to do all day,

40
00:06:57,345 --> 00:06:59,013
every day,
for the rest of my life.

41
00:06:59,064 --> 00:07:01,849
Wouldn't
that be glorious?

42
00:07:03,268 --> 00:07:04,902
Shouldn't we rest
a little while?

43
00:07:04,936 --> 00:07:07,488
Just to catch our breath?
There's no rush, is there?

44
00:07:07,522 --> 00:07:09,940
Of course not.

45
00:07:09,991 --> 00:07:11,575
Are you hungry?

46
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,994
Should I have them bring you
some cake or pomegranate juice?

47
00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:15,779
No, I'm fine.

48
00:07:15,864 --> 00:07:18,999
I just want you all to myself.

49
00:07:19,034 --> 00:07:21,418
I want to know everything
there is to know

50
00:07:21,453 --> 00:07:24,622
about King Tommen,
First of His Name.

51
00:07:24,624 --> 00:07:26,624
King Tommen.

52
00:07:26,675 --> 00:07:29,677
Still sounds strange to me.

53
00:07:29,711 --> 00:07:32,429
Does Queen Margaery
sound strange to you?

54
00:07:33,298 --> 00:07:35,299
So strange.

55
00:07:35,383 --> 00:07:37,301
- Husband.
- Wife.

56
00:07:40,522 --> 00:07:42,856
Sometimes it feels odd.

57
00:07:42,891 --> 00:07:44,541
I'm the king,

58
00:07:44,576 --> 00:07:48,646
I've married the most
beautiful woman in the world,

59
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,815
and it's all because
my brother died.

60
00:07:51,866 --> 00:07:54,034
I understand.

61
00:07:54,069 --> 00:07:57,404
But it's not your fault.
You know that, don't you?

62
00:07:57,455 --> 00:07:59,373
You mustn't feel guilty.

63
00:08:00,542 --> 00:08:02,927
I don't feel guilty.

64
00:08:02,961 --> 00:08:04,795
That's what's odd.

65
00:08:07,749 --> 00:08:09,166
Do you like to sail?

66
00:08:09,217 --> 00:08:11,251
I love to sail.

67
00:08:11,303 --> 00:08:13,387
I do, too.

68
00:08:13,421 --> 00:08:16,590
I think we're going to be
very happy, you and I.

69
00:08:16,641 --> 00:08:19,093
I do, too.

70
00:08:21,763 --> 00:08:26,233
Living in a tower so
high it touches the clouds.

71
00:08:27,686 --> 00:08:30,187
Of course, my grandmother
couldn't wait to go home.

72
00:08:30,238 --> 00:08:33,023
The capital's not
for everyone, I suppose.

73
00:08:34,993 --> 00:08:37,995
Does your mother like it here?

74
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:39,947
I don't think so.

75
00:08:39,998 --> 00:08:42,700
She told me never to trust
anyone in King's Landing.

76
00:08:44,369 --> 00:08:47,421
It's so wonderful to have
her watching over you.

77
00:08:47,455 --> 00:08:50,207
A lioness guarding her cub.

78
00:08:50,258 --> 00:08:52,876
Well, but I'm a man now.

79
00:08:55,714 --> 00:08:57,548
You are.

80
00:08:59,017 --> 00:09:00,517
And the king.

81
00:09:02,687 --> 00:09:05,522
But you'll always be
her baby boy.

82
00:09:05,557 --> 00:09:08,726
<i>- I suppose.
-  I adore her.</i>

83
00:09:08,777 --> 00:09:13,147
She's always been so
generous with me, so kind.

84
00:09:13,198 --> 00:09:14,982
And the horrors
she's had to endure--

85
00:09:15,033 --> 00:09:18,736
losing her husband, her
eldest child, and her father.

86
00:09:18,787 --> 00:09:21,488
It's no wonder she's
so protective of you.

87
00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:24,408
She'll never let you
out of her sight.

88
00:09:27,545 --> 00:09:29,797
You look
very much in love.

89
00:09:29,831 --> 00:09:32,299
The first days of marriage
are often so blissful.

90
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:35,886
She's certainly
very pretty, isn't she?

91
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,588
Like a doll.

92
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,723
She smiles quite a lot.

93
00:09:40,925 --> 00:09:43,594
Do you think she's intelligent?

94
00:09:43,645 --> 00:09:46,180
I can't quite tell.

95
00:09:46,231 --> 00:09:47,848
Not that it matters.

96
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:49,483
Do you ever miss Casterly Rock?

97
00:09:49,517 --> 00:09:52,236
There's nothing for me
in Casterly Rock.

98
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,104
That's where you grew up.

99
00:09:55,657 --> 00:09:58,609
You always told me that you
liked the people there better.

100
00:09:58,611 --> 00:10:01,945
You said that King's Landing smelled
of horse dung and sour milk.

101
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:07,117
Why are we speaking
of Casterly Rock?

102
00:10:07,168 --> 00:10:10,170
The way that
you talked about it,

103
00:10:10,205 --> 00:10:12,172
I always thought
that you missed it,

104
00:10:12,207 --> 00:10:15,459
that you-- that it
was your real home.

105
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:18,762
This is my real home now,
where my family lives.

106
00:10:19,798 --> 00:10:22,049
I want you to be happy, Mother.

107
00:10:22,967 --> 00:10:25,552
I know that.

108
00:10:25,603 --> 00:10:26,937
I know you do.

109
00:10:26,971 --> 00:10:28,605
My sweet boy.

110
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,974
But wouldn't you be
happier in Casterly Rock?

111
00:10:33,394 --> 00:10:36,697
<i>I said, "Darling,
surely four times is enough."</i>

112
00:10:36,731 --> 00:10:39,149
<i> "Are you trying to set a new record?"</i>

113
00:10:39,151 --> 00:10:42,569
He said, "Well, what is the record?
I'm sure we can break it."

114
00:10:47,542 --> 00:10:49,660
Mother.

115
00:10:49,662 --> 00:10:52,079
Welcome.

116
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,997
Don't you look lovely?

117
00:10:54,048 --> 00:10:55,549
Marriage agrees with you.

118
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:57,968
Can we bring you
anything to eat or drink?

119
00:10:58,002 --> 00:10:59,753
I wish we had some wine for you.

120
00:10:59,804 --> 00:11:01,805
It's a bit early
in the day for us.

121
00:11:03,308 --> 00:11:06,643
No, no, I can't stay.

122
00:11:06,678 --> 00:11:09,396
I just wanted to let you know

123
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:11,682
if there's ever anything
I can do for you...

124
00:11:11,684 --> 00:11:13,350
You are very sweet.

125
00:11:13,401 --> 00:11:15,853
Tommen seems quite taken
with his new queen.

126
00:11:15,855 --> 00:11:18,772
I absolutely adore him.

127
00:11:18,823 --> 00:11:20,691
You raised a gallant young man.

128
00:11:20,742 --> 00:11:22,242
I'm forever grateful.

129
00:11:22,277 --> 00:11:24,444
Good.

130
00:11:24,496 --> 00:11:27,247
Good. I'm glad to
hear you're happy.

131
00:11:27,282 --> 00:11:29,533
Ecstatic.
I really am.

132
00:11:29,584 --> 00:11:31,702
Exhausted, to be honest.

133
00:11:31,704 --> 00:11:35,506
But what could I expect?
He is half lion, half stag.

134
00:11:37,675 --> 00:11:39,543
I'll leave you to it, then.

135
00:11:39,594 --> 00:11:41,011
Oh, forgive me.

136
00:11:41,045 --> 00:11:42,713
I haven't been
at court for long.

137
00:11:42,764 --> 00:11:44,214
I get so confused.

138
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:46,433
What's the proper way
to address you now?

139
00:11:46,467 --> 00:11:49,052
Queen Mother or Dowager Queen?

140
00:11:50,555 --> 00:11:52,523
There's no need
for such formalities.

141
00:11:52,557 --> 00:11:55,809
In any event, judging from
the king's enthusiasm,

142
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,395
the Queen Mother will be
a Queen Grandmother soon.

143
00:11:58,397 --> 00:11:59,863
Won't that be a lovely day?

144
00:11:59,898 --> 00:12:01,648
Can you imagine
the celebrations?

145
00:12:01,699 --> 00:12:03,867
They'll ring the bells
all day and night.

146
00:12:03,902 --> 00:12:06,403
Remember...

147
00:12:06,405 --> 00:12:08,572
anything you need.

148
00:13:24,148 --> 00:13:26,366
<i>We can't hold the
North with terror alone.</i>

149
00:13:26,401 --> 00:13:29,036
<i> You can't hold the North if
you let these lesser lords insult us.</i>

150
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:31,622
I sent you there to
collect taxes, not bodies.

151
00:13:31,656 --> 00:13:33,991
<i>Lord Cerwyn refused to pay.</i>

152
00:13:34,042 --> 00:13:36,960
Said the Warden of the North
would always be a Stark

153
00:13:36,995 --> 00:13:39,746
and he'd be damned if he'd
kiss a traitor's boot.

154
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,134
<i>He left you no choice.</i>

155
00:13:44,168 --> 00:13:48,221
I flayed him living along
with his wife and brother.

156
00:13:48,256 --> 00:13:50,557
Made his son watch.

157
00:13:50,591 --> 00:13:52,843
And?

158
00:13:52,845 --> 00:13:55,345
The new Lord Cerwyn
paid his taxes.

159
00:14:01,853 --> 00:14:04,187
I've something important
to tell you.

160
00:14:05,189 --> 00:14:07,941
Stop eating and listen.

161
00:14:17,035 --> 00:14:18,618
We don't have enough men
to hold the North

162
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:21,154
if the other houses
rise up against us.

163
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:22,589
Do you understand that?

164
00:14:22,623 --> 00:14:24,541
Our pact with
the Lannisters protects--

165
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,543
I had a pact
with Tywin Lannister.

166
00:14:26,545 --> 00:14:28,962
And Tywin Lannister is dead.

167
00:14:29,013 --> 00:14:32,349
The remaining Lannisters are a thousand
miles away dealing with that fact.

168
00:14:32,383 --> 00:14:34,851
<i>They've never once in the
history of the Seven Kingdoms</i>

169
00:14:34,886 --> 00:14:36,720
sent their army this far north.

170
00:14:36,771 --> 00:14:39,189
If you think they will
for us, you're a fool.

171
00:14:40,391 --> 00:14:42,059
<i>We've become a great house</i>

172
00:14:42,061 --> 00:14:44,277
<i>by entering into alliances
with other houses</i>

173
00:14:44,312 --> 00:14:47,698
and parlaying those alliances
into greater power.

174
00:14:47,732 --> 00:14:50,350
The best way to forge
a lasting alliance

175
00:14:50,385 --> 00:14:52,953
isn't by peeling
a man's skin off.

176
00:14:52,987 --> 00:14:55,739
The best way is marriage.

177
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:58,742
Now that you're a Bolton
by royal decree,

178
00:14:58,793 --> 00:15:01,545
it's high time you married
a suitable bride.

179
00:15:05,299 --> 00:15:07,134
And as it happens,

180
00:15:07,168 --> 00:15:10,921
I've found the perfect girl to
solidify our hold on the North.

181
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:33,994
That's Moat Cailin.

182
00:15:34,028 --> 00:15:37,497
Yes, a bit shabby, isn't it?

183
00:15:37,532 --> 00:15:39,666
You've been here before?

184
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,618
On our way down
to King's Landing

185
00:15:41,669 --> 00:15:44,504
with my father and Arya.

186
00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:46,206
Where are you taking me?

187
00:15:46,257 --> 00:15:47,874
Home.

188
00:15:49,293 --> 00:15:51,461
The Boltons have Winterfell.

189
00:15:54,632 --> 00:15:57,551
Your marriage proposal,
it wasn't for you.

190
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:00,720
No.

191
00:16:00,772 --> 00:16:03,690
Roose Bolton
murdered my brother.

192
00:16:03,724 --> 00:16:05,475
He betrayed my family.

193
00:16:05,477 --> 00:16:06,943
He did.

194
00:16:06,978 --> 00:16:08,779
He serves the Lannisters.

195
00:16:08,813 --> 00:16:10,397
For now.

196
00:16:10,448 --> 00:16:12,899
- I won't go.
- Winterfell is your home.

197
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:15,152
- Not anymore.
- Always.

198
00:16:15,154 --> 00:16:18,238
You're a Stark. Dying your
hair doesn't change that.

199
00:16:18,289 --> 00:16:22,742
You're Sansa Stark, eldest surviving
child of Ned and Catelyn Stark.

200
00:16:22,794 --> 00:16:24,661
<i>Your place is in the North.</i>

201
00:16:24,712 --> 00:16:26,663
I can't marry him.
You can't make me.

202
00:16:26,665 --> 00:16:28,999
He is a traitor.
A murderer!

203
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,168
You're not marrying
Roose Bolton.

204
00:16:31,202 --> 00:16:34,221
No, you'll be marrying
his son and heir Ramsay.

205
00:16:34,255 --> 00:16:36,473
One day he'll be Warden
of the North and you--

206
00:16:36,507 --> 00:16:37,641
- No.
- Sansa.

207
00:16:37,675 --> 00:16:40,510
No, you can't make me.
I will starve myself.

208
00:16:40,512 --> 00:16:42,596
I will die before
I have to go there.

209
00:16:42,647 --> 00:16:45,732
I won't force you
to do anything.

210
00:16:45,766 --> 00:16:48,185
Don't you know by now
how much I care for you?

211
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,154
Say the word and we turn
the horses around,

212
00:16:51,189 --> 00:16:53,690
but listen to me.
Listen.

213
00:16:53,741 --> 00:16:56,943
You've been running
all your life.

214
00:16:56,994 --> 00:16:59,613
Terrible things happen to
your family and you weep.

215
00:16:59,664 --> 00:17:03,366
You sit alone in a darkened
room mourning their fates.

216
00:17:03,417 --> 00:17:07,370
You've been a bystander to tragedy from
the day they executed your father.

217
00:17:07,421 --> 00:17:10,006
Stop being a bystander.
Do you hear me?

218
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:11,625
Stop running.

219
00:17:16,464 --> 00:17:18,965
There's no justice in the world.

220
00:17:19,016 --> 00:17:21,384
Not unless we make it.

221
00:17:22,887 --> 00:17:25,021
You loved your family.

222
00:17:26,023 --> 00:17:28,608
Avenge them.

223
00:18:10,269 --> 00:18:12,102
<i>Banners!</i>

224
00:18:28,953 --> 00:18:30,537
How do we get through there?

225
00:18:30,588 --> 00:18:32,005
We don't.

226
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:33,957
We go around.

227
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:36,293
Takes us miles out of the way.

228
00:18:36,295 --> 00:18:37,794
We'll lose sight of them.

229
00:18:37,796 --> 00:18:39,129
Doesn't matter.

230
00:18:39,131 --> 00:18:40,797
I know where they're going.

231
00:18:44,769 --> 00:18:47,304
Aren't you getting
a bit old to be a squire?

232
00:18:51,618 --> 00:18:53,752
How did you end up
squiring for the Imp?

233
00:18:54,052 --> 00:18:55,836
He hates that nickname.

234
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:58,388
Well, he's not here
to complain about it, is he?

235
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,895
I squired for a knight
named Ser Lorimer

236
00:19:04,897 --> 00:19:06,730
during the War
of the Five Kings.

237
00:19:06,781 --> 00:19:09,733
One night he had
a bit too much to drink

238
00:19:09,735 --> 00:19:12,369
and he was famished,
so he borrowed a ham.

239
00:19:12,403 --> 00:19:13,299
He borrowed it?

240
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:14,483
He wasn't a thief.

241
00:19:14,757 --> 00:19:17,407
He was drunk and hungry
and he wasn't thinking.

242
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:19,459
<i>I was drunk, too.</i>

243
00:19:19,494 --> 00:19:21,712
He gave me half the ham.

244
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:26,967
Next morning, one of the
guards saw him passed out

245
00:19:27,001 --> 00:19:30,320
<i>under a wagon with the
hambone still in his hand.</i>

246
00:19:31,074 --> 00:19:33,140
They hanged him that afternoon.

247
00:19:34,308 --> 00:19:35,592
They tied the noose for me, too,

248
00:19:35,594 --> 00:19:38,466
<i>but Lord Tywin heard
my family name was Payne,</i>

249
00:19:38,586 --> 00:19:40,263
so he pardoned me

250
00:19:40,265 --> 00:19:42,428
and sent me to King's Landing
to squire for his son.

251
00:19:42,668 --> 00:19:45,558
As punishment for both of you.

252
00:19:45,592 --> 00:19:47,426
It didn't seem that way.

253
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,562
Lord Tyrion was always
very good to me.

254
00:19:49,596 --> 00:19:51,764
Yes, all your lords
have been very kind to you.

255
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:53,349
All except me.

256
00:19:53,351 --> 00:19:56,018
Sorry you had to squire
for such a nasty person.

257
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:59,155
I'm not sorry. You're the
best fighter I've ever seen.

258
00:19:59,189 --> 00:20:01,574
You beat the Hound.

259
00:20:01,608 --> 00:20:03,809
I'm proud to be your squire.

260
00:20:08,532 --> 00:20:11,083
I'm sorry I'm always
snapping at you.

261
00:20:11,117 --> 00:20:13,536
If you didn't snap at me,
I wouldn't learn anything.

262
00:20:17,374 --> 00:20:19,708
You want to be a knight, Pod?

263
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:21,443
Yes.

264
00:20:21,478 --> 00:20:24,263
<i>Starting tomorrow, we'll train
with a sword twice a day.</i>

265
00:20:24,297 --> 00:20:27,883
Before we ride in the morning and
after you make camp in the evening.

266
00:20:27,934 --> 00:20:30,886
- And I'm going to show you
how to ride properly. - Thank you.

267
00:20:30,888 --> 00:20:33,472
I can't knight you, but I
can teach you how to fight.

268
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:35,558
I suppose that's more important.

269
00:20:47,954 --> 00:20:51,290
You weren't a knight,
but you were a Kingsguard

270
00:20:51,324 --> 00:20:53,576
to Renly Baratheon, weren't you?

271
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,377
I was.

272
00:20:55,412 --> 00:20:57,913
Lord Tyrion said
he was a good man.

273
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,634
He was.

274
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:04,753
How did you end up
serving Renly?

275
00:21:11,177 --> 00:21:13,979
When I was a girl,
my father held a ball.

276
00:21:14,014 --> 00:21:17,600
I'm his only living child, so he
wanted to make a good match for me.

277
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:20,269
He invited dozens
of young lords to Tarth.

278
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,405
I didn't want to go, but he
dragged me to the ballroom.

279
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,744
And it was wonderful.

280
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:35,117
None of the boys noticed
how mulish and tall I was.

281
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:37,586
They shoved each other
and threatened to duel

282
00:21:37,621 --> 00:21:40,089
when they thought
it was their turn to dance.

283
00:21:41,374 --> 00:21:43,175
They whispered in my ear

284
00:21:43,209 --> 00:21:46,845
how they wanted to marry me and
take me back to their castles.

285
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:52,134
My father smiled at me
and I smiled at him.

286
00:21:53,853 --> 00:21:56,138
I had never been so happy.

287
00:21:59,059 --> 00:22:01,894
Till I saw a few
of the boys snickering.

288
00:22:03,647 --> 00:22:05,397
And then they all
started to laugh.

289
00:22:05,448 --> 00:22:08,200
They couldn't keep
the game going any longer.

290
00:22:08,234 --> 00:22:10,486
They were toying with me.

291
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:13,706
"Brienne the Beauty"
they called me.

292
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,492
Great joke.

293
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:20,296
And I realized I was
the ugliest girl alive.

294
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,999
A great lumbering beast.

295
00:22:28,338 --> 00:22:29,922
I tried to run away,

296
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:33,142
but Renly Baratheon
took me in his arms.

297
00:22:33,176 --> 00:22:36,345
"Don't let them see your
tears," he told me.

298
00:22:36,347 --> 00:22:38,180
"They're nasty little shits

299
00:22:38,182 --> 00:22:42,184
and nasty little shits
aren't worth crying over."

300
00:22:42,186 --> 00:22:45,354
He danced with me and none of the
other boys could say a word.

301
00:22:46,906 --> 00:22:49,108
Renly was the king's
brother after all.

302
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:53,696
But wasn't he...?

303
00:22:55,081 --> 00:22:58,417
Lord Tyrion said he was...

304
00:22:58,451 --> 00:23:01,670
Yes, Pod, he liked men.
I'm not an idiot.

305
00:23:01,705 --> 00:23:03,706
He didn't love me.
He didn't want me.

306
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:05,591
He danced with me
because he was kind

307
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:08,093
and didn't want to see me hurt.

308
00:23:08,128 --> 00:23:11,296
He saved me from being a joke.

309
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:14,967
From that day
until his last day.

310
00:23:17,554 --> 00:23:19,938
And I couldn't
save him in return.

311
00:23:23,393 --> 00:23:27,112
Nothing's more hateful than failing
to protect the one you love.

312
00:23:28,948 --> 00:23:32,201
One day I will avenge
King Renly.

313
00:23:32,235 --> 00:23:35,204
But you said a shadow
murdered him.

314
00:23:35,238 --> 00:23:36,622
How do you fight a shadow?

315
00:23:36,656 --> 00:23:40,542
A shadow with the face
of Stannis Baratheon.

316
00:23:40,577 --> 00:23:43,879
I know it was Stannis.
I know it in my heart.

317
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,668
Stannis is a man, not a shadow.

318
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:54,006
And a man can be killed.

319
00:23:56,676 --> 00:23:59,254
- Lord Commander.
- Your Grace.

320
00:23:59,256 --> 00:24:00,922
I'd like to speak alone.

321
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:03,475
Olly is my steward now

322
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:05,927
as I was
Lord Commander Mormont's.

323
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:10,766
I want him to attend my meetings
to learn from men with experience.

324
00:24:12,268 --> 00:24:14,369
One day he might command.

325
00:24:18,024 --> 00:24:19,274
Very well.

326
00:24:19,276 --> 00:24:21,410
Have you considered my offer?

327
00:24:22,495 --> 00:24:24,162
I have.

328
00:24:24,197 --> 00:24:26,915
And I thank you for it.
You do me great honor.

329
00:24:26,949 --> 00:24:29,701
All my life I wanted
to be Jon Stark.

330
00:24:29,752 --> 00:24:31,586
Say the word and you will be.

331
00:24:33,289 --> 00:24:35,290
But I have to refuse you.

332
00:24:36,676 --> 00:24:39,211
I'm Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

333
00:24:39,262 --> 00:24:41,179
My place is here.

334
00:24:41,214 --> 00:24:44,549
I'm giving you the chance
to avenge your family,

335
00:24:44,584 --> 00:24:47,369
to take back the castle
where you grew up.

336
00:24:49,222 --> 00:24:51,640
To rule the North.

337
00:24:51,642 --> 00:24:53,792
I wish I could fight beside you.

338
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:56,061
Believe me, I do.

339
00:24:56,112 --> 00:24:59,114
But I swore a sacred vow
at the godswood.

340
00:24:59,148 --> 00:25:02,384
I pledged my life
to the Night's Watch.

341
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:07,016
You're as stubborn
as your father.

342
00:25:07,051 --> 00:25:08,768
I can imagine no higher praise.

343
00:25:08,819 --> 00:25:10,520
I didn't mean it as praise.

344
00:25:10,522 --> 00:25:13,189
Honor got your father killed.

345
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,191
But if your mind's made up,
I won't try and dissuade you.

346
00:25:15,242 --> 00:25:18,745
May I ask, Your Grace, how long
you plan to stay at Castle Black?

347
00:25:18,779 --> 00:25:20,580
Are you bored of us already?

348
00:25:21,866 --> 00:25:24,117
You saved us
from Mance Rayder's army.

349
00:25:24,168 --> 00:25:25,368
We will never forget that.

350
00:25:25,419 --> 00:25:27,787
But it's a question of survival.

351
00:25:27,838 --> 00:25:30,373
<i>The Night's Watch can't
continue to feed your men</i>

352
00:25:30,424 --> 00:25:33,626
and the wildling
prisoners indefinitely.

353
00:25:33,677 --> 00:25:35,378
Winter is coming.

354
00:25:36,714 --> 00:25:38,348
I know it.

355
00:25:38,382 --> 00:25:40,550
We march on Winterfell
within the fortnight,

356
00:25:40,601 --> 00:25:42,769
before the snows trap us here.

357
00:25:44,021 --> 00:25:45,305
And the wildlings?

358
00:25:45,356 --> 00:25:47,690
If they'd rather burn than
fight for me, so be it.

359
00:25:47,725 --> 00:25:49,776
I leave their fate to you.

360
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:53,062
You could execute them.
That's the safest course.

361
00:25:56,951 --> 00:25:59,152
Or you could see
if this Tormund fellow

362
00:25:59,203 --> 00:26:01,738
is more willing to compromise
than Mance ever was.

363
00:26:01,789 --> 00:26:03,373
I assume the brothers
of the Night's Watch

364
00:26:03,407 --> 00:26:05,575
would rather see
the wildlings dead.

365
00:26:05,626 --> 00:26:08,411
Most of the brothers, yes.

366
00:26:08,413 --> 00:26:10,713
<i>There's little love
for the free folk here.</i>

367
00:26:10,748 --> 00:26:14,555
You're the Lord Commander.
Your decision.

368
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:17,508
You have many enemies
in Castle Black.

369
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:20,727
Have you considered sending
Alliser Thorne elsewhere?

370
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:24,348
Give him command
of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.

371
00:26:24,399 --> 00:26:27,017
I heard it was best
to keep your enemies close.

372
00:26:27,068 --> 00:26:29,520
Whoever said that
didn't have many enemies.

373
00:26:37,245 --> 00:26:39,997
<i>He sees something in you.</i>

374
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:43,283
Might not be apparent
from his tone,

375
00:26:43,334 --> 00:26:44,785
but it's the truth.

376
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:45,953
He believes in you.

377
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:48,455
I'm sorry I disappointed him.

378
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:55,796
The king is a complicated man,

379
00:26:55,798 --> 00:26:58,181
but he wants to do what's
right for the Seven Kingdoms.

380
00:26:58,216 --> 00:26:59,633
As long as he's ruling them.

381
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:02,035
He's the one true king.

382
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:04,271
He has a blood right
to that throne.

383
00:27:04,305 --> 00:27:07,808
I've sworn to stay clear of the
politics of the Seven Kingdoms.

384
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:09,476
Have you now?

385
00:27:12,313 --> 00:27:14,898
How does the Night's
Watch vow go again?

386
00:27:14,949 --> 00:27:17,484
I'll bet you've got it
memorized since you got here.

387
00:27:20,321 --> 00:27:22,573
Night gathers
and now my watch begins.

388
00:27:22,624 --> 00:27:25,826
No, not that bit.
The bit at the end.

389
00:27:25,828 --> 00:27:28,495
I am the sword in the darkness,

390
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:30,330
the watcher on the walls,

391
00:27:30,332 --> 00:27:32,416
the shield that guards
the realms of men.

392
00:27:32,467 --> 00:27:34,968
<i>-  I pledge my life--
- Right, that's enough.</i>

393
00:27:35,003 --> 00:27:37,671
The shield that guards
the realms of men.

394
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:39,056
That's what you swore to be.

395
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,124
Now, I'm not a learned man,

396
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,560
but the best way to help the
most people might not be sitting

397
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:45,812
in a frozen castle
at the edge of the world.

398
00:27:45,847 --> 00:27:48,065
It just might mean
wading in the muck,

399
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:49,850
getting your boots dirty

400
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:51,768
and doing what needs to be done.

401
00:27:51,819 --> 00:27:53,353
And what needs to be done?

402
00:27:53,355 --> 00:27:55,522
As long as the Boltons
rule the North,

403
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:57,357
the North will suffer.

404
00:27:58,409 --> 00:28:00,527
Just one man's opinion.

405
00:28:29,876 --> 00:28:31,377
What do you want?

406
00:28:31,428 --> 00:28:33,212
Who are you?

407
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:37,266
- What?
- You, who walk in here

408
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,589
with a coin you never earned

409
00:28:38,703 --> 00:28:40,871
whose value you do not respect.

410
00:28:46,211 --> 00:28:47,494
Who are you?

411
00:28:50,215 --> 00:28:51,548
No one.

412
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:53,851
Ow! Cunt!

413
00:28:53,885 --> 00:28:56,186
A lie. A sad little lie.
Who are you?

414
00:28:56,221 --> 00:28:57,938
I told you, I'm no--

415
00:28:57,972 --> 00:29:00,390
Do that again, and--

416
00:29:00,392 --> 00:29:01,925
Who are you?

417
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,228
You're about to find out.

418
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,197
What are you doing?

419
00:29:07,232 --> 00:29:09,950
We were only playing.
The Game of Faces.

420
00:29:09,984 --> 00:29:12,619
- A girl is not ready.
- Clearly not.

421
00:29:12,654 --> 00:29:15,155
I am ready!

422
00:29:15,206 --> 00:29:16,707
For what?

423
00:29:16,741 --> 00:29:18,392
For whatever you want.

424
00:29:18,426 --> 00:29:21,378
To be a Faceless Man.
To be no one.

425
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:28,252
<i>Whose sword is that?</i>

426
00:29:28,286 --> 00:29:29,786
It belongs to Arya Stark.

427
00:29:29,821 --> 00:29:32,306
Arya Stark's sword,
Arya Stark's clothes,

428
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,124
Arya Stark's stolen silver.

429
00:29:34,158 --> 00:29:38,412
A man wonders
how is it that no one

430
00:29:38,446 --> 00:29:41,732
came to be surrounded
by Arya Stark's things.

431
00:33:45,886 --> 00:33:48,571
What do we do with them
after we wash them?

432
00:34:19,503 --> 00:34:22,088
<i>Open gate!</i>

433
00:34:24,375 --> 00:34:27,293
<i>Honor guard, stand to!</i>

434
00:34:34,301 --> 00:34:36,636
<i>Hold up. Easy.</i>

435
00:34:53,821 --> 00:34:56,873
Lady Sansa.
Welcome.

436
00:35:02,963 --> 00:35:05,048
Lord Bolton.

437
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:10,219
May I introduce my son
Ramsay Bolton?

438
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:16,225
It's an honor
to meet you, my lady.

439
00:35:31,408 --> 00:35:33,743
I'll bring you
a bowl of hot water.

440
00:35:33,777 --> 00:35:35,445
You must want to wash.

441
00:35:35,447 --> 00:35:37,830
Thank you.

442
00:35:40,451 --> 00:35:43,619
Welcome home, Lady Stark.

443
00:35:45,122 --> 00:35:47,173
The North remembers.

444
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,171
Sam?

445
00:36:02,206 --> 00:36:04,524
Maester Aemon?

446
00:36:04,558 --> 00:36:06,859
He apologizes
for not being here.

447
00:36:06,894 --> 00:36:08,778
He's not feeling well.

448
00:36:08,812 --> 00:36:10,396
Take good care of him.

449
00:36:11,982 --> 00:36:14,484
Brothers.

450
00:36:14,486 --> 00:36:18,488
As you all know too well, it's long
past time to dig a new latrine pit.

451
00:36:22,709 --> 00:36:25,094
First Builder Yarwyck and I
have decided to appoint

452
00:36:25,129 --> 00:36:27,864
a latrine captain
to oversee this crucial task.

453
00:36:35,139 --> 00:36:37,173
Brian.

454
00:36:37,224 --> 00:36:39,008
Seems like a good job
for a ginger.

455
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,982
- That's him!
- That's him.

456
00:36:47,017 --> 00:36:48,935
Ser Alliser.

457
00:36:52,156 --> 00:36:55,358
<i>You have more experience than any
other ranger at Castle Black.</i>

458
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,827
You proved your valor
many times over

459
00:36:57,861 --> 00:37:00,396
while defending the Wall
from the wildling attack.

460
00:37:03,433 --> 00:37:05,334
I name you First Ranger.

461
00:37:05,369 --> 00:37:07,753
Hear, hear!

462
00:37:12,092 --> 00:37:14,010
<i>Lord Janos.</i>

463
00:37:14,044 --> 00:37:15,878
I'm giving you command
of Greyguard.

464
00:37:17,181 --> 00:37:18,881
Greyguard is a ruin.

465
00:37:18,932 --> 00:37:20,967
Yes, the fort
is in a sorry state.

466
00:37:21,018 --> 00:37:22,635
Restore it as best you can.

467
00:37:22,686 --> 00:37:24,366
First Builder Yarwyck
can spare 10 of his--

468
00:37:24,388 --> 00:37:26,422
<i> I was charged with the
defense of King's Landing</i>

469
00:37:26,456 --> 00:37:28,524
when you were soiling
your swaddling clothes.

470
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:29,692
Keep your ruin.

471
00:37:32,563 --> 00:37:35,064
All right, all right!

472
00:37:35,066 --> 00:37:36,866
Enough of that.

473
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,734
You mistake me, my lord.

474
00:37:40,304 --> 00:37:43,122
That was a command,
not an offer.

475
00:37:43,156 --> 00:37:47,126
Pack your arms and armor,
say your farewells,

476
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,579
and ride for Greyguard.

477
00:37:51,548 --> 00:37:54,584
I will not go meekly off
to freeze and die.

478
00:37:54,586 --> 00:37:57,587
Give it to one of the fools
who cast a stone for you.

479
00:37:57,638 --> 00:38:00,389
I will not have it.
Did you hear me, boy?

480
00:38:00,424 --> 00:38:02,058
I will not have it!

481
00:38:02,092 --> 00:38:04,927
Are you refusing
to obey my order?

482
00:38:10,319 --> 00:38:13,654
You can stick your order
up your bastard ass.

483
00:38:20,779 --> 00:38:22,580
Take Lord Janos outside.

484
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,617
Olly, bring me my sword.

485
00:38:48,357 --> 00:38:50,525
- Get out.
- You cannot do this!

486
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:52,193
<i>Get your hands off me!</i>

487
00:38:52,227 --> 00:38:54,362
<i>Scum, all of you!</i>

488
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:01,619
If the boy thinks he can
frighten me, he's mistaken.

489
00:39:01,653 --> 00:39:03,704
Yes, very mistaken.

490
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:07,291
Disgrace!

491
00:39:07,326 --> 00:39:08,576
I have friends.

492
00:39:08,627 --> 00:39:10,094
Important friends
in the capital.

493
00:39:10,128 --> 00:39:12,496
- You'll see.
- Kneel!

494
00:39:47,416 --> 00:39:50,167
If you have any
last words, my lord,

495
00:39:50,202 --> 00:39:52,119
now's the time.

496
00:39:54,756 --> 00:39:57,291
I was wrong.
You're the Lord Commander.

497
00:39:57,342 --> 00:39:59,343
<i>We all serve you.
I'm sorry.</i>

498
00:39:59,378 --> 00:40:02,129
<i>Not only for this, for
all I've done and said.</i>

499
00:40:04,216 --> 00:40:06,717
I was wrong.

500
00:40:06,768 --> 00:40:09,887
My lord, please!
Mercy! Mercy!

501
00:40:09,889 --> 00:40:11,772
I'll go! I will!

502
00:40:11,807 --> 00:40:13,557
<i>Please.</i>

503
00:40:13,609 --> 00:40:15,393
I'm afraid.

504
00:40:17,062 --> 00:40:19,397
I've always been afraid.

505
00:41:03,241 --> 00:41:06,444
You have served us well, my son.

506
00:41:06,446 --> 00:41:07,745
Thank you, Father.

507
00:41:07,779 --> 00:41:11,082
Which of the Seven
will you worship today?

508
00:41:11,116 --> 00:41:15,286
- The Maiden.
- Always the Maiden.

509
00:41:15,288 --> 00:41:17,204
<i>And the Stranger.</i>

510
00:41:17,255 --> 00:41:20,458
- Two is extra, you realize?
- Yes, yes.

511
00:41:30,852 --> 00:41:33,220
What are you doing?

512
00:41:33,271 --> 00:41:35,806
This establishment belongs
to Lord Petyr Baelish.

513
00:41:35,857 --> 00:41:37,041
You can't--

514
00:41:37,075 --> 00:41:39,060
You have profaned our faith,

515
00:41:39,111 --> 00:41:42,113
the faith of our fathers
and forefathers.

516
00:41:42,147 --> 00:41:44,198
I am the High Septon
of the--

517
00:41:44,232 --> 00:41:46,317
You are a sinner.

518
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:48,986
And you shall be punished.

519
00:41:59,715 --> 00:42:01,165
Ah!

520
00:42:02,968 --> 00:42:04,969
- Sinner.
- Sinner.

521
00:42:05,003 --> 00:42:07,304
<i>- Sinner. Sinner.
-  Repent!</i>

522
00:42:07,339 --> 00:42:10,174
Sinner. Sinner.

523
00:42:10,225 --> 00:42:12,810
Sinner. Sinner.

524
00:42:12,844 --> 00:42:15,846
<i>- Shame on you.
- Sinner. Sinner.</i>

525
00:42:26,525 --> 00:42:28,325
Your Grace, Grand Maester,

526
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:31,328
Lord Tyrell, uh...

527
00:42:31,363 --> 00:42:33,687
It doesn't matter.

528
00:42:33,722 --> 00:42:36,240
As the High Septon of the Faith
of the Seven,

529
00:42:36,274 --> 00:42:37,858
I give voice
to the will of the gods

530
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:40,861
and am their foremost
servant in this world.

531
00:42:40,863 --> 00:42:44,165
An insult to me
is an insult to the gods.

532
00:42:44,199 --> 00:42:46,801
An assault on my person

533
00:42:46,835 --> 00:42:48,702
is an assault
on our very religion.

534
00:42:48,753 --> 00:42:50,204
- You were assaulted?
- I was.

535
00:42:50,206 --> 00:42:52,623
By those fanatics
who call themselves sparrows.

536
00:42:52,657 --> 00:42:54,758
<i>They humiliated me,
they beat me,</i>

537
00:42:54,793 --> 00:42:58,062
<i>they left me naked and
bleeding on the cobblestones.</i>

538
00:42:58,096 --> 00:42:59,713
I am lucky to be alive.

539
00:42:59,715 --> 00:43:02,766
I heard this assault began
in Littlefinger's brothel.

540
00:43:02,801 --> 00:43:06,387
High Septon, this is a rather
shocking thing to hear.

541
00:43:06,438 --> 00:43:09,473
<i> I tend to both the highest
born and the lowliest amongst us.</i>

542
00:43:09,524 --> 00:43:11,775
Even prostitutes may earn
the mercy of the Mother.

543
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:15,779
So you were ministering to the
needs of these devout prostitutes?

544
00:43:15,814 --> 00:43:18,616
A man's private affairs
ought to stay private.

545
00:43:20,335 --> 00:43:22,403
What do you want from us,
High Septon?

546
00:43:22,405 --> 00:43:25,072
Justice. I ask that
you protect our faith

547
00:43:25,123 --> 00:43:28,826
by arresting these criminals and
throwing them in the black cells.

548
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:30,878
<i>I ask that you execute
their leader,</i>

549
00:43:30,912 --> 00:43:33,047
<i>this so-called
High Sparrow.</i>

550
00:43:33,081 --> 00:43:35,049
He's a threat to everything
we hold sacred.

551
00:43:35,083 --> 00:43:38,219
- If he goes unpunished--
- And where do I find this man?

552
00:43:38,253 --> 00:43:40,254
This High Sparrow?

553
00:43:49,765 --> 00:43:51,899
I don't think this is
a good idea, Your Grace.

554
00:43:51,934 --> 00:43:54,936
Nonsense, Ser Meryn. These
are deeply religious people.

555
00:43:54,938 --> 00:43:57,355
Where can I find
the High Sparrow?

556
00:43:59,608 --> 00:44:01,075
<i>Seven blessings.</i>

557
00:44:13,539 --> 00:44:15,790
<i>- Thank you.
- Just a little more.</i>

558
00:44:17,593 --> 00:44:19,460
<i>Thank you.</i>

559
00:44:21,347 --> 00:44:23,965
Thank you.

560
00:44:24,016 --> 00:44:26,467
A young man said I'd find
the High Sparrow back here.

561
00:44:26,518 --> 00:44:29,303
- Where is he?
- High Sparrow?

562
00:44:29,355 --> 00:44:31,055
Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it?

563
00:44:31,106 --> 00:44:34,425
Like Lord Duckling
or King Turtle.

564
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:36,444
Still, it's meant to.

565
00:44:36,478 --> 00:44:39,697
We're often stuck with the
names our enemies give to us.

566
00:44:39,732 --> 00:44:43,034
The notion that we're all equal
in the eyes of the Seven

567
00:44:43,068 --> 00:44:44,986
doesn't sit well with some,

568
00:44:45,037 --> 00:44:47,986
so they belittle me.

569
00:44:47,988 --> 00:44:50,489
<i>Seven blessings to you, my dear.</i>

570
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:51,957
It's only a name.

571
00:44:51,991 --> 00:44:54,326
Quite an easy burden to bear.

572
00:44:54,377 --> 00:44:56,495
Far easier than hers.

573
00:44:59,298 --> 00:45:01,049
<i>Why no shoes?</i>

574
00:45:01,084 --> 00:45:04,753
Because I gave them away to
someone who needed them more.

575
00:45:04,804 --> 00:45:06,088
We all do that.

576
00:45:06,139 --> 00:45:10,008
It stops us from forgetting
what we really are.

577
00:45:10,059 --> 00:45:12,678
Is that why you came
to King's Landing?

578
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,096
To remind everyone?

579
00:45:14,147 --> 00:45:17,349
Everyone? Hard enough
job reminding myself.

580
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,518
Well, I tell them
no one's special

581
00:45:19,569 --> 00:45:22,187
and they think I'm special
for telling them so.

582
00:45:23,823 --> 00:45:26,074
Perhaps they're right.

583
00:45:26,109 --> 00:45:29,027
It would be comforting to
believe that, wouldn't it?

584
00:45:30,196 --> 00:45:33,865
Have the gods sent
you here to tempt me?

585
00:45:33,916 --> 00:45:36,168
I hope not.

586
00:45:36,202 --> 00:45:40,539
I had assumed you'd only
come here to arrest me

587
00:45:40,541 --> 00:45:43,258
for that incident
with the High Septon.

588
00:45:43,292 --> 00:45:46,011
An unacceptable way to treat
the chosen representative

589
00:45:46,045 --> 00:45:48,547
of the gods in this world,
wouldn't you say?

590
00:45:48,598 --> 00:45:51,016
Hypocrisy is a boil.

591
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:53,789
Lancing a boil
is never pleasant.

592
00:45:54,723 --> 00:45:57,826
Although they could have been more careful
with the blade.

593
00:45:58,213 --> 00:46:01,348
The High Septon came
to speak to me today.

594
00:46:02,967 --> 00:46:04,247
He doesn't want me
to arrest you.

595
00:46:04,268 --> 00:46:05,802
He wants me to execute you.

596
00:46:08,272 --> 00:46:11,108
I wouldn't presume to know
your thoughts on the matter.

597
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,781
My thoughts on the matter
are in line with your own.

598
00:46:17,815 --> 00:46:22,235
The High Septon's behavior was
corrosive, as was his attitude.

599
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:26,156
Having a man like that reside in the sept
eats away at the faith from the inside.

600
00:46:27,542 --> 00:46:30,744
So now he resides in the
Red Keep dungeons instead.

601
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:34,398
The faith and the crown
are the two pillars

602
00:46:34,432 --> 00:46:35,882
that hold up this world.

603
00:46:35,917 --> 00:46:38,085
One collapses,
so does the other.

604
00:46:39,804 --> 00:46:43,924
We must do everything necessary
to protect one another.

605
00:47:02,443 --> 00:47:04,945
<i>- Your Grace.
-  Send a raven with this message</i>

606
00:47:04,996 --> 00:47:08,448
to Littlefinger at the Eyrie or
wherever he's slithering about.

607
00:47:11,452 --> 00:47:13,370
At once, Your Grace.

608
00:47:14,405 --> 00:47:15,672
How's your work coming along?

609
00:47:15,706 --> 00:47:17,207
Very well.

610
00:47:17,258 --> 00:47:18,792
You've made progress?

611
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:20,460
More than I expected.

612
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:23,380
- Still a way to go, but...
- Very good.

613
00:47:23,431 --> 00:47:25,132
I'll leave you to it, then.

614
00:47:25,134 --> 00:47:29,469
Make sure Littlefinger is clear on the
meaning of the word "immediately."

615
00:47:45,453 --> 00:47:47,537
Shh.

616
00:47:48,739 --> 00:47:50,657
Easy, friend.

617
00:48:13,898 --> 00:48:15,932
She really is lovely.

618
00:48:15,967 --> 00:48:18,602
I hope I can make her happy.

619
00:48:18,636 --> 00:48:21,154
I hope so, too.

620
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:24,691
I've become quite fond of Lady
Sansa during our travels together.

621
00:48:24,742 --> 00:48:27,027
She's suffered enough.

622
00:48:27,078 --> 00:48:28,995
I'll never hurt her.

623
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:30,664
You have my word.

624
00:48:33,034 --> 00:48:35,452
I've heard very little
about you,

625
00:48:35,503 --> 00:48:38,872
which makes you quite a
rare thing as lords go.

626
00:48:40,041 --> 00:48:42,425
I haven't been a lord very long.

627
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:44,294
I was a bastard.

628
00:48:44,345 --> 00:48:46,713
And you're not anymore.

629
00:48:46,764 --> 00:48:49,549
Allow me a moment alone
with Lord Baelish.

630
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:51,101
Yes, Father.

631
00:48:51,135 --> 00:48:52,686
And thank you, Lord Baelish.

632
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,138
I'm forever in your debt.

633
00:49:01,028 --> 00:49:03,063
He seems pleased.

634
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:05,565
Shouldn't he be?

635
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:07,534
I assure you,
she's still a virgin.

636
00:49:07,568 --> 00:49:09,786
Tyrion never consummated
the marriage.

637
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:12,405
By the law of the land,
she is no man's wife.

638
00:49:13,407 --> 00:49:14,958
Inspect her if you must.

639
00:49:14,992 --> 00:49:16,660
I'll leave that
to the brothel keeper.

640
00:49:16,711 --> 00:49:18,745
It's her name I need,
not her virtue.

641
00:49:18,796 --> 00:49:21,414
Then I have delivered
everything I promised.

642
00:49:22,667 --> 00:49:24,918
And you're prepared
for the consequences

643
00:49:24,969 --> 00:49:27,504
when the Lannisters hear I've
wed Sansa Stark to Ramsay?

644
00:49:27,555 --> 00:49:30,307
The Lannister name doesn't
mean what it once did.

645
00:49:30,341 --> 00:49:32,175
Tywin is dead.

646
00:49:32,226 --> 00:49:34,594
He kept his house in power
through sheer will.

647
00:49:34,645 --> 00:49:38,265
Without him, Jaime has
one hand and no allies.

648
00:49:38,316 --> 00:49:40,433
Tommen is a soft boy,

649
00:49:40,484 --> 00:49:42,736
not a king to fear.

650
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:44,588
The queen will be enraged.

651
00:49:44,622 --> 00:49:47,607
<i>Queen Margaery adores Sansa.</i>

652
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:49,409
Cersei is Queen Mother,

653
00:49:49,443 --> 00:49:52,279
a title whose importance
wanes with each passing day.

654
00:49:52,281 --> 00:49:54,114
And yet she still has friends,

655
00:49:54,165 --> 00:49:57,584
men in important places whom
she can ask for favors.

656
00:49:57,618 --> 00:50:01,454
A message for you
from Cersei Lannister.

657
00:50:01,505 --> 00:50:04,791
A rider arrived from the
Eyrie shortly before dawn.

658
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:07,021
Apparently she thinks
you're still in the Vale.

659
00:50:07,055 --> 00:50:10,307
A message for me you say?

660
00:50:10,309 --> 00:50:12,192
Strange that the seal is broken.

661
00:50:12,227 --> 00:50:14,445
I'm sure you understand
my position, Lord Baelish.

662
00:50:14,479 --> 00:50:17,398
If you receive word in the
night from the Queen Mother,

663
00:50:17,449 --> 00:50:20,317
it does make me question
our new alliance.

664
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:24,405
The Lannisters made you one of
the great lords of Westeros,

665
00:50:24,456 --> 00:50:27,458
yet here you are in the
North undermining them.

666
00:50:27,492 --> 00:50:29,326
Why gamble with your position?

667
00:50:30,829 --> 00:50:32,997
Every ambitious move
is a gamble.

668
00:50:33,048 --> 00:50:36,750
You gambled when you drove a
dagger into Robb Stark's heart.

669
00:50:39,004 --> 00:50:41,055
It appears that
your gamble paid off.

670
00:50:41,089 --> 00:50:42,840
You're Warden of the North.

671
00:50:42,842 --> 00:50:44,725
I had Tywin Lannister's backing.

672
00:50:44,759 --> 00:50:47,311
Who supports me now?
You?

673
00:50:47,345 --> 00:50:49,763
The Eyrie is mine.

674
00:50:49,814 --> 00:50:51,932
The last time
the lords of the Eyrie

675
00:50:51,983 --> 00:50:54,518
formed an alliance
with the lords of the North,

676
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:57,688
they brought down the greatest
dynasty this world has ever known.

677
00:51:00,608 --> 00:51:03,527
I'd like to borrow
one of your birds.

678
00:51:03,578 --> 00:51:05,696
Cersei will expect a reply.

679
00:51:05,698 --> 00:51:08,198
I'd like to read the reply.

680
00:51:30,438 --> 00:51:32,723
I have to get out
of this wheelhouse.

681
00:51:32,774 --> 00:51:34,108
Volantis is a large city.

682
00:51:34,142 --> 00:51:36,276
I have to get out
of this wheelhouse.

683
00:51:36,311 --> 00:51:39,813
The likelihood of you being spotted
here increases a hundredfold.

684
00:51:39,864 --> 00:51:42,066
Mm, I have to get out
of this wheelhouse.

685
00:51:42,068 --> 00:51:45,035
I'm not sure how many new
ways I can find of saying this.

686
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:52,292
I will not be of any use
to Daenerys Targaryen

687
00:51:52,327 --> 00:51:54,411
if I lose my mind.

688
00:51:54,413 --> 00:51:57,631
I can't remember the last
face I saw that wasn't yours.

689
00:51:57,665 --> 00:51:59,466
It's a perfectly good face.

690
00:51:59,501 --> 00:52:01,385
I am losing my mind.

691
00:52:01,419 --> 00:52:03,804
If anyone recognizes you,
you'll lose more than that.

692
00:52:03,838 --> 00:52:06,673
Look, we are thousands
of miles from Westeros.

693
00:52:09,427 --> 00:52:11,678
What am I?

694
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:13,680
One more drunk dwarf.

695
00:52:14,933 --> 00:52:17,434
<i> Whoa!</i>

696
00:52:43,344 --> 00:52:44,511
<i>We have to go now.</i>

697
00:52:44,546 --> 00:52:46,547
<i>Come on, hold it.
Hold it.</i>

698
00:52:46,598 --> 00:52:48,215
<i>Are you ready?</i>

699
00:52:50,135 --> 00:52:51,802
Slaves.

700
00:52:51,853 --> 00:52:55,722
Yes, the Volantene masters
are very organized.

701
00:52:56,641 --> 00:52:59,293
<i>Flies for dung shovelers.</i>

702
00:52:59,327 --> 00:53:01,645
<i>Hammers for builders.</i>

703
00:53:01,647 --> 00:53:04,148
<i>Tears for whores.</i>

704
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:06,200
Lest they forget.

705
00:53:19,497 --> 00:53:21,443
We should keep moving.

706
00:53:36,848 --> 00:53:38,849
The only red priest
we had in King's Landing

707
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:41,068
was Thoros of Myr.

708
00:53:41,102 --> 00:53:42,736
This one's
much better-looking.

709
00:53:50,361 --> 00:53:51,912
Stone Men.

710
00:53:51,946 --> 00:53:55,449
Good luck stopping the spread
of greyscale with prayer.

711
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,868
You'd have better luck
dancing away the plague.

712
00:53:57,919 --> 00:53:59,453
Shh.

713
00:54:07,929 --> 00:54:10,097
We're going to meet the savior.

714
00:54:10,131 --> 00:54:11,598
You should have told me.

715
00:54:11,633 --> 00:54:14,384
<i>Who doesn't want
to meet the savior?</i>

716
00:54:29,450 --> 00:54:31,735
Come on.

717
00:54:31,786 --> 00:54:33,704
Let's find a brothel.

718
00:54:40,211 --> 00:54:42,746
<i>Build your house in a day.</i>

719
00:54:57,512 --> 00:55:00,764
It's even better luck
to suck a dwarf's cock.

720
00:55:05,103 --> 00:55:07,771
See?
We blend right in.

721
00:55:07,773 --> 00:55:11,275
Just two more travelers
mad with lust.

722
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:17,364
Thank you.

723
00:55:26,424 --> 00:55:28,458
What curious hair.

724
00:55:30,128 --> 00:55:32,296
The Mother of Dragons!

725
00:55:34,766 --> 00:55:37,517
It appears you're not
the only Targaryen supporter.

726
00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:40,887
We were just heading
east to see you.

727
00:55:40,939 --> 00:55:42,606
I've got a dragon for you.

728
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,942
How much to make him spit fire?

729
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:51,481
Someone who inspires
priests and whores

730
00:55:51,483 --> 00:55:52,950
is worth taking seriously.

731
00:55:52,984 --> 00:55:54,484
What makes you worth that much?

732
00:55:54,535 --> 00:55:56,820
- I'm magic.
- I'll bet you bloody are.

733
00:56:00,124 --> 00:56:02,542
Well, she's taken.

734
00:56:03,995 --> 00:56:05,462
Where are you going?

735
00:56:05,496 --> 00:56:08,048
I need to speak
to someone with hair.

736
00:56:09,968 --> 00:56:12,252
- Hello.
- Hello.

737
00:56:12,303 --> 00:56:14,671
- You've got no drink.
- You've got no money.

738
00:56:14,673 --> 00:56:16,974
Do I look like
a man without money?

739
00:56:18,593 --> 00:56:20,344
Never trust looks.

740
00:56:20,346 --> 00:56:23,647
Until quite recently, I was one
of the richest men in the world.

741
00:56:25,566 --> 00:56:28,819
Who needs wealth when you
can make a woman laugh?

742
00:56:30,938 --> 00:56:33,273
I always pay my debts.

743
00:56:33,324 --> 00:56:34,741
I'm well known for it.

744
00:56:39,447 --> 00:56:42,082
You like her.

745
00:56:42,116 --> 00:56:43,867
They all like her.

746
00:56:43,918 --> 00:56:45,369
They all want to fuck a queen.

747
00:56:45,371 --> 00:56:47,204
That's because
they've never met a queen.

748
00:56:47,255 --> 00:56:48,672
You're just saying that.

749
00:56:48,706 --> 00:56:51,124
You know how to spot a liar.

750
00:56:51,175 --> 00:56:53,627
If I could pick any girl here,

751
00:56:53,678 --> 00:56:56,179
I would pick you.

752
00:56:56,214 --> 00:56:57,714
Why?

753
00:56:57,716 --> 00:57:00,183
Because you have
a skeptical mind.

754
00:57:04,555 --> 00:57:06,556
All right, then.
I'm warning you,

755
00:57:06,558 --> 00:57:09,059
we're going to have
to wash you first.

756
00:57:09,110 --> 00:57:10,527
Come on.

757
00:57:18,119 --> 00:57:21,121
I'm-- I'm sorry,
I can't.

758
00:57:22,206 --> 00:57:25,208
Of course you can.
You're shy.

759
00:57:25,243 --> 00:57:27,160
I'm not.

760
00:57:28,746 --> 00:57:30,213
Have another drink.

761
00:57:30,248 --> 00:57:33,166
Gladly, but this I can't do.

762
00:57:33,217 --> 00:57:36,219
Believe me, no one is
more shocked than I am.

763
00:57:36,254 --> 00:57:38,755
I hope it passes.

764
00:57:38,806 --> 00:57:41,425
What will I do in my spare time?

765
00:57:44,062 --> 00:57:47,013
Go for a piss.
That's a start.

766
00:58:05,333 --> 00:58:07,918
No need to worry.
I was just--

767
00:58:07,952 --> 00:58:11,671
Oh, I thought
you were someone else.

768
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:14,124
Show's almost over.

769
00:58:14,175 --> 00:58:17,761
I'm sure there are girls inside
who'd be happy to oblige.

770
00:58:19,013 --> 00:58:20,340
You've made
some kind of mistake.

771
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:23,383
Why don't you tell me what you
think you're doing and then--

772
00:58:24,507 --> 00:58:26,970
I'm taking you to the queen.
