Bedford's murder attempt and fearing for Ned's safety, Delia wants no more involvement with Melinda's paranormal activities. That doesn't stop Ned from helping Melinda and Eli deal with a multiple haunting at an abandoned house (much against Delia's wishes). Despite an unusual lack of informational sources, they pit themselves against the powerful, wheelchair-bound ghost of a fake medium with a special attachment to the shadows and a hunger for bringing ghost children into her home. And that doesn't cover all the ghosts involved.\u2014statmanjeff"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "1576521", "rating": 7.9, "votes": 240, "number_of_episodes": 107}
