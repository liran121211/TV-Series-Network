Zebro takes them to the servants' quarters where they meet Seaquant and rest for the night. They discover that every thing in the house is extremely heavy, so they decide to train so they can be strong enough to open the Testing Gate on their own. Meanwhile, Killua is being tortured by his brother Milluki until he is ready to apologize to his mother. Killua learns from his family that his friends are at the estate to see him. Gon, Leorio, and Kurapika are able to open the gate after completing their training (and Gon's left arm heals), but the apprentice butler Canary stands in their way. Just like with Zebro, Gon's conviction touches Canary's heart. Just as Canary is about to let them pass, Killua's mother attacks her. Killua's mother then gives the group a sad message from Killua that may or may not be true."], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "2439682", "rating": 7.8, "votes": 1808, "number_of_episodes": 148}
