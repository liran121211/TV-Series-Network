When the flashbacks end, Kikyo, Killua's mother, tells them that Killua cannot see them as he is in solitary confinement. While speaking with the trio, Kikyo suddenly begins screaming to \"Father\" that he not do anything hasty. Killua's grandfather, Zeno, arrives in the dungeon and tells Killua he can go, despite Milluka insisting Killua isn't genuinely sorry yet. Killua is summoned by his father, Silva. With help from Canary, who is concerned about Killua, Gon and his friends are getting closer to the mansion. Meanwhile, Killua is bonding with his father (much to Kikyo's strong displeasure), and Silva asks him if he wants to see his friends. Killua answers truthfully that he does, so Silva grants him his freedom with the promise that Killua should never betray his friends. A short squabble between Kikyo and Silva reveals that he still believes Killua will one day return home as the leader of the Zoldyck family."], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "2439684", "rating": 8.1, "votes": 1880, "number_of_episodes": 148}
