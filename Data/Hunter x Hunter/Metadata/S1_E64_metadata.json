They each catch a few and then they move on to the hardest monster in the area, the bubble horse. They got the card by dodging the blue bubbles with zetsu, and the red bubbles with ten. Biscuit comments that Gon and Killua make the perfect team. Gon and Killua also learned Ko, Ken and Ryu. Biscuit believes they are now ready for the final stage of the training which is training in the individual categories, starting with the Enhancer category. The Bomber identifies himself in the group whilst the Phantom Troop discovered the island and confirms their suspicion that Greed Island is in fact happening in the real world.\u2014paulp1988"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "3055166", "rating": 7.5, "votes": 1451, "number_of_episodes": 148}
