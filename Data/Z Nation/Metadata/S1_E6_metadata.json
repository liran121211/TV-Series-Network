They accept the condition and are admitted in the place. At the same time, three persons that joined the Church of the fanatic and insane Jacob are re-admitted in the compound. While the group is eating, Warren and Garnett have sex in a private room. Out of the blue, the three readmitted persons commit suicide in strategic places and turn into zombies, biting the others and multiplying the number of the zombies.
