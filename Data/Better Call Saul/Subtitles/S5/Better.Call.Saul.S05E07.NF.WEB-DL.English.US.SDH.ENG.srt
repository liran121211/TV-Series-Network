Mr. Goodman?

Mr. Goodman.

537
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:31,095
[IN NORMAL VOICE]
That's right, Your Honor. Witness tampering.

538
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:32,388
I have reason to believe

539
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:35,516
that the prosecution's key witness was coached

540
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:40,521
by a private investigator
who was hired to pervert justice.

541
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:44,024
Does the prosecution have a response?

542
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:46,861
Unfortunately, Your Honor,

543
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:51,490
it seems a person unknown to my team
may have interacted with our witness,

544
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,492
causing her to call Detective Roberts

545
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:57,163
and amend her statement
two months after the initial interview.

546
00:40:57,246 --> 00:41:02,877
This only recently came to our attention,
and we are vigorously investigating.

547
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,962
I would hope so.

548
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:10,050
Having said that, Your Honor, this witness
is one small element of the state's case.

549
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:13,846
In light of the extraordinary violence of the crime

550
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:18,726
and the fact that Mr. De Guzman is
a foreign national with no ties to the community,

551
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:21,812
we ask that the Court recognize him as a flight risk

552
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:24,482
and as a danger to the citizens of New Mexico.

Mr. Goodman?

Uh, all due respect, Your Honor,

555
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:36,243
but the witness is not just one small element
of the state's case,

556
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:40,789
she's the only witness tying Mr. De Guzman
to the murder scene.

557
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:43,417
And she's been manipulated.

558
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:47,296
Furthermore, the claim that Mr. De Guzman
has no ties to the community,

559
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:49,507
that's just patently false.

560
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:53,886
Mr. De Guzman has deep ties
to the city of Albuquerque.

561
