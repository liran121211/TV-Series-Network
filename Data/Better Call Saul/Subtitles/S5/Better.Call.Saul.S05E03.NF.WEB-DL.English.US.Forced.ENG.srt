1
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,249
Is everything okay?

2
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:23,792
Yes. Of course.

3
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:24,877
Can I come in?

4
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,339
It's okay?

5
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:31,675
It's fine.

6
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,607
Can I get you anything?

7
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,152
Want a coffee?

8
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,660
So big.

9
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,205
And new.

10
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,482
How are you, Papa?

11
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:16,905
Gutierrez made me an offer.
He wants to buy the shop.

12
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:19,741
Really?

13
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,662
Don't tell me.

14
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:25,831
Does he want to turn it into another tire shop?

15
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,128
He wants to keep it as is.

16
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:34,756
But...

17
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:38,093
he offered more than it's worth

18
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,470
even with the land.

19
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,393
What are you going to do?

20
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:56,111
I always thought I was
keeping the shop for you.

21
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:06,747
Are you going to work 11 hours a day

22
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,040
for the rest of your life?

23
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:13,879
What do you think?

24
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,174
It sounds like a good deal.

25
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:20,969
Could be...

26
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:23,931
your chance to retire.

27
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,190
This is you, isn't it?

28
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,903
I don't know what you mean.

29
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,863
You put Gutierrez up to this.

30
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:43,283
This is your money he's offering me.

31
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,374
This is you trying to get me to leave town.

32
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:52,376
You want to run.

33
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:54,461
You want me to run too.

34
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,297
Deny it.

35
00:20:58,298 --> 00:20:59,716
Tell me I'm wrong.

36
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,762
Look me in the eyes.

37
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:10,894
I've told you what you should do.

38
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,396
Give this up.

39
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,814
Go to the police.

40
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:15,649
Face what you've done.

41
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:20,570
If you want to run, run.

42
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:23,073
But me?

43
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,702
No way, I will not run away.

44
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:33,175
This dude. Good idea.
