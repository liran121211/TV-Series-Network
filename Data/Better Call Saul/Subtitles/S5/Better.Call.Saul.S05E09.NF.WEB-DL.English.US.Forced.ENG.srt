1
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:30,852
{\an8}Look.

2
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:35,106
{\an8}Cops are gonna go crazy looking for me
for a few months.

3
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,233
{\an8}Maybe a year.

4
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:40,320
{\an8}Then the heat will die down, like it always does.

5
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:41,488
{\an8}Until then,

6
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:46,117
{\an8}Ignacio or one of the other guys,
they'll get you anything you need.

7
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,579
{\an8}Tio, come on. Don't be this way.

8
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:55,627
{\an8}There are still lots of moves
to make against Fring.

9
00:29:57,378 --> 00:30:02,258
{\an8}When I'm home, I'll have Eladio's ear.

10
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:07,263
{\an8}I'll make sure he's sick of the Chicken Man.

11
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:09,349
{\an8}Then,

12
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:11,059
{\an8}what's Fring's...

13
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,728
{\an8}will be ours.

14
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:20,276
{\an8}Eleven months from now, Tuco gets out
of prison. He'll run things here.

15
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:26,241
{\an8}I know, I know. Tuco. He's a hothead.

16
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:28,618
{\an8}When he's on the stuff, he's...

17
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:34,249
{\an8}We'll make sure someone is on him.

18
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,043
{\an8}He'll stay clean.

19
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:03,152
{\an8}Family is everything.

20
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:11,974
{\an8}You'll see.
