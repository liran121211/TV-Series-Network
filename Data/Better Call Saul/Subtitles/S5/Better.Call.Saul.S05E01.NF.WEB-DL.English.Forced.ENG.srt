1
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,846
Why are you in the North?

2
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,474
To protect my family's interests.

3
00:32:57,475 --> 00:33:01,187
Following Gustavo's men?
Spying on him?

4
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:04,315
And this business
at Travel Wire. Messy.

5
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,777
This is not how we conduct ourselves
this side of the border.

6
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:11,322
Look. I apologize.
It's my uncle's influence.

7
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,241
You know what Hector's like.

8
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,702
So suspicious, so unreasonable.

9
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:21,165
Hector has this crazy idea
in his head

10
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:24,293
that somehow, the chicken man...

11
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:27,797
might carry a grudge, after he shot
Fring's boyfriend in the head.

12
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:33,720
You don't understand Gustavo.
With him, it's all business.

13
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:36,347
All business?

14
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,685
Like what happened in Santiago?
Was that business, too?

15
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:46,691
I need to know
that this is done with.

16
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:53,614
You trust Fring?

17
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:58,870
He'll never be one of us,
but he earns.

18
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:03,583
As long as he brings in the dollars,
Eladio is happy.

19
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:05,960
That's all that matters.

20
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,549
Then there's nothing more to say.

21
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,890
- Give my best to your uncle.
- I will.
