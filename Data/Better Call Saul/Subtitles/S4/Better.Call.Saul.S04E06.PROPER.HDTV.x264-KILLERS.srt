1
00:00:00,027 --> 00:00:01,928
Previously on "Better Call Saul"...

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:04,271
I actually have the number of a shrink.

3
00:00:04,296 --> 00:00:05,295
I'm already seeing someone.

4
00:00:05,297 --> 00:00:07,799
I decide what he deserves.

5
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,632
I will get my law license back.

6
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:11,868
My partner and I will get a new office.

7
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,870
I have tons of Mesa Verde to catch up on.

8
00:00:13,872 --> 00:00:15,896
You have work. I have work.

9
00:00:15,898 --> 00:00:16,767
It's all good.

10
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:17,947
I don't know
what to tell you, Paige.

11
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:19,178
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:20,621
It'll never happen again.

13
00:00:20,623 --> 00:00:21,639
It's impossible?

14
00:00:21,664 --> 00:00:23,732
Difficult. Not quite impossible.

15
00:00:25,235 --> 00:00:26,485
Give me your money.

16
00:00:26,903 --> 00:00:28,002
Back in the day,

17
00:00:28,004 --> 00:00:29,988
they would have known not to roll me.

18
00:00:39,382 --> 00:00:40,782
Here you go.

19
00:00:45,422 --> 00:00:48,256
Are you sure about these?
The pool's up to $200.

20
00:00:48,258 --> 00:00:50,057
I've made my choices.

21
00:00:50,059 --> 00:00:51,777
Well... Confidence.

22
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:53,993
An admirable trait.

23
00:00:55,006 --> 00:00:56,105
Clara.

24
00:00:56,107 --> 00:00:56,932
Hey, Jimmy.

25
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:58,242
- What do you got for me?
- I'm stuck

26
00:00:58,267 --> 00:00:59,800
on Documentary Short Subject.

27
00:00:59,802 --> 00:01:02,646
Mm. Yeah. Just go with your gut.

28
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,671
"Howards End" all the way down, huh?

29
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:12,863
I just love Emma Thompson.

30
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:13,740
Who doesn't?

31
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,242
She's so pragmatic.

32
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:17,436
Yeah, well, fingers crossed.

33
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:22,580
Hey, hey. Hey.

34
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:23,748
How'd we do?

35
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,484
This is everything from two.

36
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:28,685
And I even got Chloe to throw in.

37
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:31,633
Many have tried to argue with Kim Wexler.

38
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,066
All have failed.

39
00:01:33,068 --> 00:01:35,569
I'm headed up to four. You got anything?

40
00:01:35,571 --> 00:01:36,636
Yep.

41
00:01:38,207 --> 00:01:39,539
And I'll do three.

42
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:40,923
Already done.

43
00:01:41,577 --> 00:01:44,354
You know, you're making
the rest of us look bad.

44
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:47,916
If you wouldn't stop
at every cubicle to chat...

45
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,401
It's called being friendly.

46
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:50,667
It's great for morale.

47
00:01:50,669 --> 00:01:52,936
It is great for wasting time.

48
00:01:52,938 --> 00:01:54,571
- That, too.
- Okay.

49
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:56,073
It's... So, discovery for Cordero

50
00:01:56,075 --> 00:01:57,374
is coming this afternoon,

51
00:01:57,376 --> 00:01:59,176
so you might want to kick it up a bit.

52
00:02:02,681 --> 00:02:04,047
Wow.

53
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:05,282
- Congratulations.
- He really did it.

54
00:02:05,284 --> 00:02:06,883
- What?
- Isaacson.

55
00:02:08,155 --> 00:02:09,963
- The case.
- I don't...

56
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,840
Isaacson vs. Vakarian Holdings, Inc.

57
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,235
We've been assembling binders for months.

58
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,512
I've been kind of slammed
with the Oscar pool,

59
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,281
in case you weren't paying attention.

60
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,369
Right. Sorry. I'll try harder.

61
00:02:21,635 --> 00:02:25,479
So, this guy, Isaacson...
he dies of a heart attack.

62
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,545
- Mm-hmm.
- And his family they're our clients...

63
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:28,880
sort through his financials, you know,

64
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:30,215
looking to track down his assets.

65
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:33,403
Lo and behold, they find some old shares

66
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:37,115
in this company he invested in
like 20 years back.

67
00:02:37,443 --> 00:02:40,677
Family tracks down the CFO,
looking to cash out,

68
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,537
but he tells them, "Hmm,

69
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,537
that corporation's been dissolved."

70
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,640
Isaacson's shares are worthless.

71
00:02:46,642 --> 00:02:47,774
- Whoa.
- Right?

72
00:02:47,776 --> 00:02:49,276
But Chuck does some digging,

73
00:02:49,278 --> 00:02:51,813
and it turns out
they formed a new corporation

74
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,131
that's virtually identical

75
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,897
to the old corp Isaacson invested in.

76
00:02:54,899 --> 00:02:57,903
It's the same officers,
same structure, everything.

77
00:02:57,928 --> 00:02:59,494
- Ah.
- Right?

78
00:02:59,496 --> 00:03:03,016
So, Chuck finds exemption 4
in Leannais vs. Cincinnati,

79
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,618
- which is compl...
- Okay. Okay. Yeah, listen.

80
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:05,936
I appreciate the effort,

81
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,979
but can you just big-picture it for me?

82
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,445
I am.

83
00:03:09,447 --> 00:03:11,083
Chuck won a case

84
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:12,695
that Howard thought was unwinnable

85
00:03:12,695 --> 00:03:16,163
using only the power of obscure case law.

86
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,304
That's... good.

87
00:03:19,304 --> 00:03:20,661
Yeah, very.

88
00:03:21,787 --> 00:03:23,912
Congratulations, Mr. McGill.

89
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,445
- Jimmy.
- Chuck.

90
00:03:25,447 --> 00:03:26,746
- Big day, huh?
- Yeah.

91
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,014
Thanks, uh...

92
00:03:28,016 --> 00:03:29,449
- Kim. Wexler.
- Of course.

93
00:03:29,451 --> 00:03:30,883
- You're one of our law students?
- Yes.

94
00:03:30,885 --> 00:03:32,218
- I'm in my third year at UNM...
- Ah.

95
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,586
...thanks to HHM.

96
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:36,022
- How's it going?
- Very well. Thank you.

97
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:39,236
And congratulations again on Isaacson.

98
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:40,178
Well...

99
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,863
I'm sure that you considered it.

100
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:42,973
I just wanted to ask.

101
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:45,075
Vakarian Holdings, Inc.,
would have been liable

102
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,799
under the "continuing
enterprise" exception,

103
00:03:46,801 --> 00:03:48,001
- as well, right?
- That's right.

104
00:03:48,003 --> 00:03:49,563
Yeah, we looked into that.

105
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,196
What was the case law on that?

106
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:54,066
- Uh, Garcia vs. Coe Manufacturing.
- Mm-hmm.

107
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:56,101
Sounds like it was Isaacson v. Chuck

108
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:58,337
handing him his butt on a platter, huh?

109
00:03:58,339 --> 00:04:01,340
Well, yeah, but Isaacson is our client.

110
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,682
Oh, really? Okay.

111
00:04:02,684 --> 00:04:04,985
Well, the... the other guys' butts, then.

112
00:04:04,987 --> 00:04:07,773
Yeah, served on platters.
That's right. Thanks, Jimmy.

113
00:04:08,631 --> 00:04:10,500
Hail the conquering hero.

114
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,252
Thanks, Howard.

115
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,420
I hate to interrupt,

116
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,314
but there's a "Mr. Bushmills"
waiting in my office.

117
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,572
Mmm.

118
00:04:17,574 --> 00:04:18,992
Kim. Jimmy.

119
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:24,379
Congratulations.

120
00:04:26,216 --> 00:04:27,698
That'll be you soon.

121
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:29,711
Yep.

122
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:33,815
Kay. See ya later, Jimmy.

123
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,258
See ya.

124
00:04:45,213 --> 00:04:47,226
Ben, what you got for me?

125
00:04:47,228 --> 00:04:48,561
There's your winner.

126
00:04:50,998 --> 00:04:52,832
You think Pacino's gonna "hoo-ah" his way

127
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,975
to Oscar glory, huh?

128
00:04:58,806 --> 00:05:00,339
Last call for ballots.

130
00:06:03,594 --> 00:06:06,549
With respect
to the zoning committee,

131
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,574
we maintain that the Mesa Verde statue

132
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:11,644
should be exempt
from sign code restrictions

133
00:06:11,646 --> 00:06:14,941
on size and location

134
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:19,196
because it is a work of art.

135
00:06:28,716 --> 00:06:31,997
Specifically, its function extends

136
00:06:31,999 --> 00:06:35,353
beyond furthering the company's
economic interests,

137
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,789
which distinguishes it
from commercial speech

138
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,108
under legal precedent.

139
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:43,128
Um, Viola, can you look up

140
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,371
the relevant case law here for me?

141
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:05,558
I'm, uh... I think it is maybe...

142
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:09,706
uh, U.S. v. United Foods.

143
00:07:11,648 --> 00:07:12,899
Yeah.

144
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,173
Good morning.

145
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:16,621
Jimmy. Morning!

146
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,053
Oh. Good morning.

147
00:08:18,055 --> 00:08:20,256
I'm just... just making the O.J.

148
00:08:20,258 --> 00:08:21,543
I see that.

149
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,494
I didn't hear you come to bed.

150
00:08:32,332 --> 00:08:35,448
I was up late
justifying a giant horse statue

151
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,106
to the Park City zoning commission.

152
00:08:37,108 --> 00:08:38,476
How big we talking?

153
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:41,329
"I'm definitely overcompensating
for some other shortcoming" big.

154
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,626
Your hours pretty much set now?

155
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:47,360
Yeah.

156
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,925
Weekdays 9:00 to 4:00, the busy time.

157
00:08:49,927 --> 00:08:51,120
Oh, yeah?

158
00:08:52,342 --> 00:08:53,591
It's dead, Kim.

159
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,282
It's deader than disco.

160
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:56,436
Mm. Sorry.

161
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:59,055
Does that mean you were able to schedule

162
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,874
an appointment with the therapist?

163
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,354
I decided not to go.

164
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:11,826
Oh.

165
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:17,040
Um... okay.

166
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:24,162
I thought you already decided to go.

167
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:27,064
I know, and I did.

168
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:33,237
But then I... time went by,
and I kind of calmed down

169
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:36,768
and realized it's just...
it's just not for me.

170
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:38,978
Why not?

171
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,579
It's just not.

172
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,816
I don't think that navel-gazing

173
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:47,585
is gonna get me where I need to be.

174
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,853
Yeah, but how do you know...

175
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:50,454
Unless I try?

176
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:52,490
It just doesn't feel right.

177
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:55,028
I need to be moving forward, you know?

178
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:58,021
And now I got this job,
and I'm kind of on a path.

179
00:09:58,023 --> 00:10:02,625
And, uh
Just wanna give this a try.

180
00:10:02,627 --> 00:10:04,054
Is that okay?

181
00:10:05,096 --> 00:10:06,723
Sure.

182
00:10:07,678 --> 00:10:10,247
Yeah. Of course, Jimmy.

183
00:10:11,084 --> 00:10:13,636
Yeah. Listen, I know you wanted me to go.

184
00:10:14,303 --> 00:10:16,272
You have to do what's best for you.

185
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,944
Oof. Uh, I should go open up.

186
00:10:23,946 --> 00:10:28,576
Um... sushi tonight?

187
00:10:29,154 --> 00:10:31,281
Uh, yeah. Yeah, that sounds great.

188
00:10:53,712 --> 00:10:55,222
Kim.

189
00:10:56,215 --> 00:10:57,380
Hello, Rich.

190
00:10:57,382 --> 00:10:58,815
- So good to see you.
- You too.

191
00:10:58,817 --> 00:11:00,483
Thanks for seeing me
on such short notice.

192
00:11:00,485 --> 00:11:01,786
Oh, are you kidding?

193
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,221
I've been wanting to thank you in person

194
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:04,747
ever since you sent
Billy Gatwood our way.

195
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,147
So, shall we?

196
00:11:06,574 --> 00:11:08,416
So, how long you got with that thing?

197
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:09,750
- Three more weeks.
- Mm.

198
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:12,046
Can I sign it?
Do people still do that?

199
00:11:13,414 --> 00:11:14,914
Please have a seat. Have a seat.

200
00:11:16,317 --> 00:11:17,950
I won't lie.

201
00:11:17,952 --> 00:11:20,620
Losing Billy Gatwood definitely hurt.

202
00:11:20,622 --> 00:11:22,156
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

203
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,433
I think he misses you.

204
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,327
As long as he's taken care of, I'm happy.

205
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,687
Well, you made it easy for us.

206
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,547
We just continued what you started.

207
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,291
So, um, how is James holding up?

208
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,095
I didn't get to speak with him
at the funeral.

209
00:11:36,971 --> 00:11:38,771
We're taking it one day at a time.

210
00:11:38,773 --> 00:11:40,205
Mm.

211
00:11:40,207 --> 00:11:42,477
Well, grief moves at its own pace.

212
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:45,644
And it's different for everybody, so...

213
00:11:45,646 --> 00:11:47,446
Give him my best.

214
00:11:47,448 --> 00:11:48,781
Thank you.

215
00:11:48,783 --> 00:11:50,902
So, what can I do for you?

216
00:11:52,119 --> 00:11:54,486
- I have a question for you.
- Mm-hmm.

217
00:11:54,488 --> 00:11:56,741
How's your banking division?

218
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,875
Well, we have some banking work,

219
00:11:59,877 --> 00:12:02,044
but I wouldn't say we have a division.

220
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,349
Would you like one?

221
00:12:18,788 --> 00:12:22,809
Well, it's a good long way
from the rest of your operation.

222
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:25,252
It must remain completely separate.

223
00:12:26,462 --> 00:12:28,381
Two bedrooms each.

224
00:12:29,076 --> 00:12:31,131
Werner'll probably take his own,

225
00:12:31,133 --> 00:12:33,444
and the rest of the guys can double up.

226
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,669
Wired and plumbed?

227
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:36,889
Yes.

228
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:39,217
Oh, this is a good start.

229
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,287
What do you have in mind?

230
00:12:42,645 --> 00:12:45,206
Hmm.

231
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:51,402
Couple treadmills over there,
barbells, weight bench.

232
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:54,123
You build out a stocked bar, beer on tap.

233
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,242
I mean, they're German, so...

234
00:12:56,637 --> 00:13:00,238
Entertainment system here, DVD player.

235
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,705
Projector and screen set-up
might be nice,

236
00:13:02,707 --> 00:13:05,741
a few La-Z-Boys or couches, pool table.

237
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,543
I don't know. Foosball?

238
00:13:07,545 --> 00:13:09,378
Hell, we could even put up a hoop.

239
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,314
Germans play basketball, yeah?

240
00:13:11,316 --> 00:13:12,867
I believe so.

241
00:13:13,874 --> 00:13:16,952
You know, Werner said that
this was gonna take 6 months,

242
00:13:16,954 --> 00:13:20,890
which means 8 at least,
probably 10, in total isolation.

243
00:13:20,892 --> 00:13:23,726
These guys are gonna be doing
10 hours heavy labor

244
00:13:23,728 --> 00:13:25,728
every day... well, night.

245
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:27,563
Then coming home to this.

246
00:13:27,565 --> 00:13:29,131
We can't just keep 'em alive.

247
00:13:29,133 --> 00:13:31,669
We got to keep 'em
from climbing the walls.

248
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:38,634
Make a list.

249
00:13:40,178 --> 00:13:43,606
Security.

250
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,783
I'd like a full camera perimeter inside,

251
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,318
and we'll keep it low-profile.

252
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,539
They'll know we'll be watching.

253
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:52,790
We just don't need
to stick it in their faces.

254
00:13:53,091 --> 00:13:55,191
Outside, too, obviously,

255
00:13:55,193 --> 00:13:58,894
in case someone tries
to find a way in or out.

256
00:14:02,935 --> 00:14:05,267
I'll put a sally port on that door.

257
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,222
We'll control it from the outside.

258
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:11,684
And we're gonna need a trailer
to monitor the cameras.

259
00:14:12,444 --> 00:14:14,104
Close by.

260
00:14:14,512 --> 00:14:18,441
2 guys, 24-hour monitoring,
working shifts.

261
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:22,285
Let's say five guys, minimum.

262
00:14:22,287 --> 00:14:25,188
Probably help to have a couple
German speakers, as well.

263
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,866
I can provide you men.

264
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:28,488
Well, I'm gonna need to vet 'em.

265
00:14:28,513 --> 00:14:30,395
- No offense.
- Of course.

266
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,934
- What is it?
- Infection. Bad one.

267
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:42,824
I must leave.

268
00:14:43,108 --> 00:14:45,875
Tell Tyrus what you need.
It will be done.

269
00:14:51,216 --> 00:14:53,251
You got a pen?

270
00:14:53,651 --> 00:14:55,685
- I'll remember.
- Yeah?

271
00:14:56,988 --> 00:14:58,354
Treadmills.

272
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:00,056
You want to check wholesale providers.

273
00:15:00,058 --> 00:15:03,393
These guys are gonna tear
right through consumer-grade.

274
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,063
I'd love to see what something,

275
00:15:07,064 --> 00:15:11,135
say, like a 24-footer, would run me.

276
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:12,433
Uh, sorry.

277
00:15:12,435 --> 00:15:13,579
We just don't make them that big.

278
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,830
Who does?

279
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,297
- I can't think of anyone around here.
- Yeah.

280
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:20,728
Well, who makes those huge signs
that the casinos have?

281
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:21,879
Um...

282
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,382
You know what? Never mind.
Thank you very much.

283
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,152
Jimmy McGill.

284
00:15:30,154 --> 00:15:32,087
Uh, yes.
I'm looking for Jimmy McGill.

285
00:15:32,089 --> 00:15:34,389
Yeah. You found him.

286
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,953
The lawyer?

287
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,927
Yeah. Wh... What can I do for you?

288
00:15:38,929 --> 00:15:40,623
My name is Brett Dunst.

289
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,400
I think you did my aunt's will?

290
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,299
At least, that's what it says here.

291
00:15:44,301 --> 00:15:46,001
She, um... She died.

292
00:15:46,003 --> 00:15:48,406
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Thanks.

293
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:50,967
I'm the executor,
and I distributed all her stuff,

294
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:53,192
but there's some kind
of finer details in this thing

295
00:15:53,194 --> 00:15:54,453
that are real tricky.

296
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,097
I thought maybe you could
help me with those.

297
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:58,332
Who was your aunt?

298
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,244
Geraldine Strauss.

299
00:16:01,035 --> 00:16:03,771
Oh, Mrs. Strauss passed away?

300
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:04,657
H-How?

301
00:16:04,657 --> 00:16:07,759
She, um... She went in her sleep
a couple weeks ago.

302
00:16:07,761 --> 00:16:09,527
Heart failure.

303
00:16:09,529 --> 00:16:11,295
Oh.

304
00:16:12,999 --> 00:16:16,267
- Hello?
- Um...

305
00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:20,505
Did Clarence get the Alpine Shepherd Boy?

306
00:16:20,507 --> 00:16:22,001
I'm sorry?

307
00:16:22,542 --> 00:16:24,976
Uh, the Hummel.

308
00:16:24,978 --> 00:16:28,174
Oh, the little figure.
Yeah, yeah, he got it.

309
00:16:28,615 --> 00:16:31,883
So, uh, he finished college then?

310
00:16:31,885 --> 00:16:34,352
Yep. Just this last semester.

311
00:16:34,354 --> 00:16:37,288
Well, good. That's... That's good.

312
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:38,523
How did you kno...

313
00:16:38,525 --> 00:16:41,146
Oh, because you did the will. Right.

314
00:16:42,395 --> 00:16:44,996
Is there a memorial?

315
00:16:44,998 --> 00:16:47,318
Uh, sorry. It was last week.

316
00:16:48,234 --> 00:16:50,526
Anyway, it's my busiest time at work,

317
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,320
and Angie's doing the best she can,

318
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,388
but I have to get back to Salt Lake.

319
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:55,854
Are you on an hourly rate,

320
00:16:55,856 --> 00:16:58,890
or would this be, like,
a flat-fee kind of thing?

321
00:17:02,562 --> 00:17:04,424
Mr. McGill?

322
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:07,432
I'm sorry. I, uh...

323
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:11,947
I'm not practicing any longer.

324
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:13,872
Aw, darn it.

325
00:17:15,308 --> 00:17:16,875
I can refer you, though.

326
00:17:16,877 --> 00:17:21,613
Um... Hamlin Hamlin McGill

327
00:17:21,615 --> 00:17:24,649
has an excellent estate law department,

328
00:17:24,651 --> 00:17:26,354
and they'll help you sort things out.

329
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,923
Just ask for Francis Scheff,

330
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:31,023
and he'll point you
in the right direction.

331
00:17:31,025 --> 00:17:33,759
Hamlin Hamlin McGill.

332
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:36,395
McGill. Wait. Isn't that you?

333
00:17:36,397 --> 00:17:39,709
Uh, it's just a coincidence.

334
00:17:40,001 --> 00:17:42,535
All right. Well, thank you, Mr. McGill.

335
00:17:42,537 --> 00:17:44,422
You bet.

336
00:17:46,718 --> 00:17:48,108
God damn it.

337
00:18:03,891 --> 00:18:07,460
My husband and I
scrimped and saved for so many years.

338
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:09,462
We did our best to build a nest egg

339
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:12,698
so that we wouldn't
be a burden to our family.

340
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:16,569
After Ronald passed, I moved
to an assisted-living facility,

341
00:18:16,571 --> 00:18:18,304
a nice place.

342
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:20,606
They told me they'd take care
of everything,

343
00:18:20,608 --> 00:18:24,477
but then one day, they said
all my money was gone.

344
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:26,912
How could that be?

345
00:18:26,914 --> 00:18:29,248
Where did it all go?

346
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,716
If you or a loved one is a resident

347
00:18:30,718 --> 00:18:32,985
of a Sandpiper Crossing facility...

348
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:34,279
...or other associated

349
00:18:34,304 --> 00:18:35,488
retirement community,

350
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,457
you may be eligible to receive
compensation for...

351
00:18:41,562 --> 00:18:42,728
Hey there.

352
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,096
Hey.

353
00:18:44,098 --> 00:18:45,731
Guess where I am.

354
00:18:45,733 --> 00:18:47,299
Somewhere good?

355
00:18:47,301 --> 00:18:49,070
Somewhere very good.

356
00:18:49,488 --> 00:18:51,030
You could be here, too.

357
00:19:13,261 --> 00:19:14,460
Hey there.

358
00:19:14,462 --> 00:19:16,862
Hey... Giselle.

359
00:19:17,965 --> 00:19:19,331
I was thinking

360
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:20,966
we could just be Kim and Jimmy today.

361
00:19:20,968 --> 00:19:23,435
Ah. Okay.

362
00:19:23,437 --> 00:19:24,937
Those two aren't all bad.

363
00:19:25,374 --> 00:19:26,939
Rumors and hearsay.

364
00:19:26,941 --> 00:19:28,274
How's work?

365
00:19:29,477 --> 00:19:31,310
It is a job.

366
00:19:31,312 --> 00:19:34,046
And how about you? Work's good?

367
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:36,849
Yeah. Actually, I have news.

368
00:19:36,851 --> 00:19:38,317
Good news.

369
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:40,052
It's great news, really.

370
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:43,722
It could change things for Wexler/McGill.

371
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:47,326
But I met with Rich Schweikart today.

372
00:19:47,328 --> 00:19:49,353
- Really?
- Yeah.

373
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:50,863
Well, you know, they took on Gatwood,

374
00:19:50,865 --> 00:19:52,525
so I've been meaning to follow up.

375
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:55,459
And ahh anyway, we were talking,

376
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:57,895
and he offered me a job.

377
00:19:57,897 --> 00:19:59,563
Again?

378
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:02,366
What? He can't take no for an answer?

379
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:05,503
They want me to run
their banking division.

380
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:07,408
Build it, really.

381
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,241
You're not seriously considering it?

382
00:20:10,703 --> 00:20:13,206
I'd be coming in as a partner.

383
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,413
But I thought things were going okay

384
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:17,648
with Mesa Verde since, uh...

385
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,378
They are. They were.

386
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:23,721
My workload has gotten
a lot more complicated lately.

387
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:26,557
I've been taking on some pro bono work,

388
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,426
overflow from
the public defender's office.

389
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:32,496
P.D. overflow? When did you... Why?

390
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:37,668
I like it.

391
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:40,441
I'm good at it.

392
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:45,576
And I'm helping people, Jimmy.

393
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,211
And I know that sounds cheesy.

394
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:50,080
It's, you know, it's whatever,
but it's the truth.

395
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:54,018
No. It, uh, makes a lot of sense.

396
00:20:57,623 --> 00:21:01,392
I have been thinking about
criminal law myself lately

397
00:21:01,394 --> 00:21:05,196
you know,
for when I get my license back.

398
00:21:05,633 --> 00:21:07,231
Really?

399
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:08,532
Yeah.

400
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:09,800
You know, like you said,

401
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:11,628
you know, you're helping people.

402
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:15,873
I'm thinking an office

403
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,775
in one of these refurbished bungalows,

404
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,476
you know, downtown by the courts,

405
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:22,413
you know, stick around where all
the people who need help are.

406
00:21:22,415 --> 00:21:24,715
Boy.

407
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:29,700
It has a nice ring to it now...
"Wexler/McGill... criminal law."

408
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:33,552
That all sounds great.

409
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:37,123
The thing is,

410
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:40,798
if I go to Schweikart and Cokely,

411
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,068
I have all those associates
to help cover Mesa Verde.

412
00:21:44,964 --> 00:21:46,971
It'll keep paying the bills

413
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:50,074
and free me up to do
the work I really care about.

414
00:21:54,113 --> 00:21:57,448
So, you kind of get to have
your cake and eat it, too.

415
00:21:58,436 --> 00:22:00,396
Kind of, yeah.

416
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:08,792
I'll be right back.

417
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:10,194
- No. Jimmy.
- What?

418
00:22:10,196 --> 00:22:12,908
I... No, I just... I got to hit the head.

419
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:49,945
I say do it.

420
00:22:50,503 --> 00:22:54,138
It's a great opportunity,
and you should jump on it.

421
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,007
You mean that?

422
00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:58,509
Yeah.

423
00:22:58,511 --> 00:23:00,706
Kim, you got to do what's best for you.

424
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,708
You sure?

425
00:23:04,016 --> 00:23:05,849
Yes.

426
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:08,255
I can't ask you to wait around for me.

427
00:23:09,255 --> 00:23:10,754
And who knows?

428
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:13,824
10 months, a lot can happen.

429
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:15,059
Yeah.

430
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:16,860
Yeah. Who knows?

431
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:20,164
Yeah. So, um, to Schweikart and Cokely...

432
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:21,699
and Wexler.

433
00:24:04,578 --> 00:24:06,445
Hi.

434
00:24:06,447 --> 00:24:08,547
Hi.

435
00:24:10,818 --> 00:24:12,084
I only have a few minutes.

436
00:24:12,086 --> 00:24:13,819
I have to pick Kaylee up.

437
00:24:14,989 --> 00:24:16,621
Okay.

438
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,293
What did you want to tell me, Mike?

439
00:24:23,997 --> 00:24:26,298
I stand by what I said.

440
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,200
The guy's a charlatan.

441
00:24:28,202 --> 00:24:30,135
But there's a time and there's a place,

442
00:24:30,137 --> 00:24:31,464
and that wasn't it.

443
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:37,803
You left me quite the mess.

444
00:24:39,146 --> 00:24:40,723
Yeah. I can see that.

445
00:24:48,155 --> 00:24:51,723
It'll be okay eventually.

446
00:24:53,894 --> 00:24:56,728
Anita's not happy.
You might want to call her.

447
00:24:58,132 --> 00:24:59,742
Probably better if I don't.

448
00:25:01,869 --> 00:25:05,706
You know that I would never forget Matty.

449
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:09,585
I know.

450
00:25:11,245 --> 00:25:12,978
No one expects you to wear a hair shirt

451
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,813
for the rest of your life.

452
00:25:14,815 --> 00:25:16,882
Same goes for you.

453
00:25:16,884 --> 00:25:18,817
You and Kaylee okay?

454
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,920
We're good.

455
00:25:22,515 --> 00:25:25,457
Then I'm good.

456
00:25:27,327 --> 00:25:30,862
I... was thinking

457
00:25:30,864 --> 00:25:33,799
maybe I could pick Kaylee up
from school tomorrow.

458
00:25:37,004 --> 00:25:39,615
Yeah, that'd be a big help, Pop.

459
00:25:43,677 --> 00:25:45,777
See you then.

460
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:47,846
Okay.

461
00:26:03,464 --> 00:26:05,430
No, no. I'd tell you.

462
00:26:05,432 --> 00:26:07,732
Nobody's heard anything.

463
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:09,768
You can go in, Jimmy. He's expecting you.

464
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:12,137
- Thanks, Julie.
- Mm.

465
00:26:15,242 --> 00:26:17,042
Oh, hey, Jimmy.

466
00:26:17,044 --> 00:26:18,577
Howard.

467
00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:19,811
This was going in the mail today.

468
00:26:19,813 --> 00:26:21,446
You would have gotten it by Friday.

469
00:26:21,448 --> 00:26:25,383
Yeah. I got a pressing need
only $5,000 will cure.

470
00:26:25,385 --> 00:26:26,954
Well, there you go then.

471
00:26:28,489 --> 00:26:29,915
Everything correct?

472
00:26:30,491 --> 00:26:32,057
Looks good. Thanks.

473
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:32,922
Of course.

474
00:26:32,922 --> 00:26:35,858
Hey, I, uh, see a lot
of empty cubicles out there.

475
00:26:35,883 --> 00:26:37,293
What's going on?

476
00:26:38,245 --> 00:26:40,155
We're doing some reorganizing.

477
00:26:40,671 --> 00:26:44,008
Just making the office a little
more fêng shui, I take it?

478
00:26:45,226 --> 00:26:46,886
We've had some setbacks.

479
00:26:47,962 --> 00:26:49,962
Paying out to Chuck's estate?

480
00:26:51,699 --> 00:26:53,165
That is part of it.

481
00:26:55,456 --> 00:26:56,938
And to be frank,

482
00:26:57,515 --> 00:27:01,483
the firm's reputation is...
not what it was.

483
00:27:02,026 --> 00:27:04,459
So, what's the plan?

484
00:27:04,461 --> 00:27:07,949
The consultants call it "rightsizing."

485
00:27:08,749 --> 00:27:14,320
No. I mean what's the plan
to get HHM back on its feet?

486
00:27:29,904 --> 00:27:31,403
Are you kidding me? I...

487
00:27:31,405 --> 00:27:33,172
I just referred a client to you guys.

488
00:27:33,174 --> 00:27:35,074
You're welcome, by the way.

489
00:27:35,076 --> 00:27:37,076
And you're telling me
this place is falling apart?

490
00:27:37,078 --> 00:27:38,911
Get your shit together, Howard.

491
00:27:38,913 --> 00:27:41,080
- Excuse me?
- Oh, please.

492
00:27:41,082 --> 00:27:42,561
You suffer one little setback,

493
00:27:42,563 --> 00:27:45,147
and you're gonna let
your entire legacy go?

494
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,453
- One little setback?
- Fine.

495
00:27:47,455 --> 00:27:50,089
Your pain is very special. Woe is you.

496
00:27:50,091 --> 00:27:52,258
Just stop wallowing, okay?

497
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,026
This place is all you've got!

498
00:27:54,028 --> 00:27:55,995
That and your hair, which, let's face it,

499
00:27:55,997 --> 00:27:57,997
clock's ticking there, too, so...

500
00:27:57,999 --> 00:27:59,431
You want to save your business?

501
00:27:59,433 --> 00:28:00,833
You want to save your dignity?

502
00:28:00,835 --> 00:28:02,134
You're gonna have to fight.

503
00:28:02,136 --> 00:28:03,546
Hey.

504
00:28:04,472 --> 00:28:06,716
You're a shitty lawyer, Howard.

505
00:28:07,375 --> 00:28:09,108
But you're a great salesman.

506
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,677
So get out there and sell.

507
00:28:12,347 --> 00:28:13,846
Fuck you, Jimmy.

508
00:28:13,848 --> 00:28:16,392
There you go. Use that.

509
00:28:21,055 --> 00:28:22,855
That's $4,000, please.

510
00:28:22,857 --> 00:28:24,623
- Here's a tip.
- Thank you very much.

511
00:28:24,625 --> 00:28:26,725
- Pleasure doing business with you.
- You, as well.

512
00:29:32,893 --> 00:29:35,513
Sorry.

513
00:29:36,764 --> 00:29:38,230
All set over here.

514
00:29:38,232 --> 00:29:39,934
You got a spot yet?

515
00:29:41,102 --> 00:29:43,980
Piñatas? Are you kidding?

516
00:29:45,306 --> 00:29:48,474
No, no, that could... could work, yeah.

517
00:29:48,476 --> 00:29:50,876
Regardless, we have full run
of the place?

518
00:29:50,878 --> 00:29:52,780
There's no prying eyes?

519
00:29:53,914 --> 00:29:55,080
All right.

520
00:29:55,082 --> 00:29:56,659
Well, that's it, then.

521
00:29:57,284 --> 00:30:00,886
Ah, she's fine.

522
00:30:00,888 --> 00:30:04,056
Yeah, I change half the water
in the tank every week.

523
00:30:04,058 --> 00:30:05,824
She's good.

524
00:30:05,826 --> 00:30:07,626
No. I know. Don't over-feed.

525
00:30:07,628 --> 00:30:10,295
I... All right, goodbye.

526
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,599
What are you doing?

527
00:30:13,601 --> 00:30:16,635
Oh! Mrs. Nguyen.

528
00:30:16,637 --> 00:30:19,972
Just, you know, step right on in
anytime, you know?

529
00:30:19,974 --> 00:30:22,107
What's all this?

530
00:30:23,344 --> 00:30:25,110
It's a side business.

531
00:30:25,112 --> 00:30:27,312
I thought you were a lawyer.

532
00:30:27,314 --> 00:30:29,248
I've had a temporary setback.

533
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:31,483
Lost your job again?

534
00:30:31,485 --> 00:30:33,952
Did you need something, Mrs. Nguyen?

535
00:30:33,954 --> 00:30:35,921
I don't want people coming in and out

536
00:30:35,923 --> 00:30:37,356
to buy your stupid phones.

537
00:30:37,358 --> 00:30:38,757
I'm not gonna sell them
out of the office,

538
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:39,858
so don't worry about it.

539
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,627
You can't keep them here.

540
00:30:41,629 --> 00:30:42,961
Uh, I pay rent for this place,

541
00:30:42,963 --> 00:30:44,596
so I can do whatever I want with it.

542
00:30:44,598 --> 00:30:46,098
They're a fire hazard.

543
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,961
Well, they're not gonna
be here very long, okay?

544
00:30:51,705 --> 00:30:54,373
Hmm.

545
00:30:59,346 --> 00:31:01,880
That's... That's on me.

546
00:31:01,882 --> 00:31:05,250
No, it's, uh, prepaid, 350 minutes.

547
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:12,318
Get-rich-quick schemes never work.

548
00:31:13,193 --> 00:31:14,526
Just watch me!

549
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,265
The doctor tells me
your fever has gotten worse.

550
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:48,062
They say this infection may kill you.

551
00:31:55,569 --> 00:31:57,405
Even if it doesn't...

552
00:31:58,539 --> 00:32:01,440
my doctor tells me again and again

553
00:32:01,442 --> 00:32:03,119
that you may never wake.

554
00:32:05,779 --> 00:32:09,948
And yet I wait.

555
00:32:25,266 --> 00:32:27,602
I grew up quite poor.

556
00:32:29,103 --> 00:32:30,646
We lived in the hills,

557
00:32:32,148 --> 00:32:35,818
in a place my brothers built
from things they found...

558
00:32:37,378 --> 00:32:40,197
metal sheeting, plywood.

559
00:32:42,249 --> 00:32:45,984
When it rained, it smelled like hay.

560
00:32:48,455 --> 00:32:50,166
We were always hungry.

561
00:32:51,751 --> 00:32:57,840
But there was a lucuma tree,
scrawny, barely alive.

562
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:01,928
My family had given up on it
years before.

563
00:33:02,503 --> 00:33:04,263
Never bore fruit.

564
00:33:06,407 --> 00:33:12,313
When I was 7, I became fixated on it.

565
00:33:13,147 --> 00:33:16,776
I watered it, tended to it.

566
00:33:18,252 --> 00:33:20,196
It took a long time,

567
00:33:21,789 --> 00:33:25,757
but the buds grew into green fruit.

568
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:27,959
I was so proud.

569
00:33:27,961 --> 00:33:29,628
I didn't tell anyone.

570
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:32,664
I plucked one and hid behind our shack.

571
00:33:32,666 --> 00:33:34,766
I ate the whole thing.

572
00:33:34,768 --> 00:33:38,589
I'd never tasted something so sweet.

573
00:33:39,707 --> 00:33:43,575
It was like caramel.

574
00:33:45,446 --> 00:33:48,547
At first, we ate the fruit ourselves,

575
00:33:48,549 --> 00:33:51,310
and then I began taking it
to the village to sell.

576
00:33:54,555 --> 00:33:58,690
One day, much of the fruit
was gone from my tree.

577
00:34:01,462 --> 00:34:05,449
Piece were scattered
on the ground, half-eaten.

578
00:34:07,568 --> 00:34:12,070
I thought it was probably a coati.

579
00:34:13,707 --> 00:34:15,084
Have you ever seen one?

580
00:34:17,086 --> 00:34:21,279
About the size of a large housecat.

581
00:34:22,983 --> 00:34:25,050
Opportunists.

582
00:34:26,587 --> 00:34:32,190
I built a snare using branches and wire.

583
00:34:32,192 --> 00:34:34,979
It didn't take long
for the animal to set it off.

584
00:34:35,596 --> 00:34:38,430
But the coati thrashed so hard,

585
00:34:38,432 --> 00:34:40,484
it broke out of the snare...

586
00:34:41,769 --> 00:34:45,156
broke its leg, as well.

587
00:34:45,906 --> 00:34:50,342
I tried to grab it, but it slipped away.

588
00:34:50,344 --> 00:34:52,163
It ran under the house.

589
00:34:53,614 --> 00:34:57,460
I knew it would show itself
sooner or later.

590
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:06,124
So I waited... for hours, into the night.

591
00:35:09,029 --> 00:35:10,848
When my brothers called for me...

592
00:35:14,134 --> 00:35:16,034
I did not answer.

593
00:35:16,036 --> 00:35:18,303
I didn't make a sound.

594
00:35:20,541 --> 00:35:22,234
I was so still.

595
00:35:25,779 --> 00:35:29,492
Finally, it came out.

596
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:34,663
It knew I was there, but it was hungry.

597
00:35:36,623 --> 00:35:39,877
This time, I was ready.

598
00:35:41,128 --> 00:35:42,963
I caught it.

599
00:35:44,898 --> 00:35:46,801
It fought me.

600
00:35:48,702 --> 00:35:51,937
But I was stronger.

601
00:35:57,077 --> 00:35:59,396
The merciful thing
would have been to kill it.

602
00:36:09,623 --> 00:36:11,086
I kept it.

603
00:36:13,486 --> 00:36:15,560
It lived for quite some time.

604
00:36:20,334 --> 00:36:25,770
I believe you will wake, Hector.

605
00:36:56,029 --> 00:36:57,230
Wow.

606
00:36:57,232 --> 00:36:58,898
_

607
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,199
Crazy.

608
00:37:00,201 --> 00:37:03,669
_

609
00:37:03,671 --> 00:37:06,105
_

610
00:37:08,042 --> 00:37:09,575
_

611
00:37:09,577 --> 00:37:12,378
Hallo!

612
00:37:17,252 --> 00:37:19,786
_

613
00:37:19,788 --> 00:37:21,921
_

614
00:37:49,951 --> 00:37:53,986
All right, gentlemen, we have
a few things to go over here.

615
00:38:02,797 --> 00:38:05,022
That means you, too.

616
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,300
Kai.

617
00:38:09,777 --> 00:38:12,238
Over here, Kai.

618
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,993
_

619
00:38:13,994 --> 00:38:16,951
_

620
00:38:30,491 --> 00:38:33,626
We've got four bedrooms
between the two houses.

621
00:38:33,628 --> 00:38:36,529
I leave it to you to figure out
the roommate situation.

622
00:38:36,531 --> 00:38:38,431
I assume you're all friends,

623
00:38:38,433 --> 00:38:41,033
and I don't really want to hear
about it if you aren't.

624
00:38:41,035 --> 00:38:43,803
Working kitchen so you can cook
whatever you want.

625
00:38:43,805 --> 00:38:47,306
The refrigerators, the cabinets
are stocked with the essentials.

626
00:38:47,308 --> 00:38:49,609
There's a shopping list.

627
00:38:49,611 --> 00:38:51,544
You write down whatever you need,

628
00:38:51,546 --> 00:38:53,513
and we'll get it.

629
00:38:53,515 --> 00:38:55,648
There is a phone in each house.

630
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:59,285
It goes directly to me or one of my guys.

631
00:38:59,287 --> 00:39:02,188
Anything you need, call.

632
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:04,724
So, when do the girls get here?

633
00:39:12,367 --> 00:39:14,834
Anything within reason.

634
00:39:21,209 --> 00:39:23,676
Any more questions?

635
00:39:27,982 --> 00:39:29,515
All right.

636
00:39:29,517 --> 00:39:32,485
You've got some time to relax
and settle in.

637
00:39:32,487 --> 00:39:34,903
Work starts tomorrow night.

638
00:39:37,692 --> 00:39:39,892
Michael.

639
00:39:39,894 --> 00:39:41,427
They are all good boys.

640
00:39:41,429 --> 00:39:43,963
Once the work begins, they focus.

641
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:46,465
I see to it.

642
00:39:46,874 --> 00:39:49,616
What you've done here is very impressive.

643
00:39:49,618 --> 00:39:51,537
Thank you for that, Michael.

644
00:39:51,539 --> 00:39:53,102
Right.

645
00:39:54,236 --> 00:39:55,668
If you need anything

646
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,103
to make this go better, you let me know.

647
00:39:57,105 --> 00:39:59,606
I will, certainly.

648
00:40:42,884 --> 00:40:44,317
Hey, Mike.

649
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:45,724
Hey.

650
00:41:03,505 --> 00:41:06,206
You keep an eye on this one.

651
00:41:32,977 --> 00:41:34,273
Hey.

652
00:41:34,803 --> 00:41:36,169
I come in peace.

653
00:41:36,171 --> 00:41:39,038
I'm just... just here to make a deal.

654
00:41:39,736 --> 00:41:41,697
What kind of deal?

655
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:45,545
Look, fellas, we... we got off
on the wrong foot, okay?

656
00:41:45,547 --> 00:41:47,714
I'm sure you saw me out here
selling my wares,

657
00:41:47,716 --> 00:41:50,650
and you thought I was just some rube,

658
00:41:50,652 --> 00:41:52,385
out looking to score a quick buck

659
00:41:52,387 --> 00:41:54,020
and just begging to be rolled.

660
00:41:54,022 --> 00:41:57,457
But, guys, I'm thinking long term.

661
00:41:57,459 --> 00:41:59,859
I see a real need in this community

662
00:41:59,861 --> 00:42:02,829
for safe, affordable, untraceable phones,

663
00:42:02,831 --> 00:42:04,564
and I'm ready to fill it.

664
00:42:04,566 --> 00:42:07,333
Wah-wah-wah.

665
00:42:07,335 --> 00:42:08,568
All right.

666
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:10,403
All right, straight talk.

667
00:42:10,405 --> 00:42:12,005
I need to be able to sell my phones

668
00:42:12,007 --> 00:42:15,408
without worrying
about getting ripped off.

669
00:42:15,814 --> 00:42:17,710
I'm proposing

670
00:42:17,712 --> 00:42:20,713
if you let me sell my phones
without hassle, I cut you in,

671
00:42:20,715 --> 00:42:25,185
say, 100 bucks every night that I'm out.

672
00:42:25,187 --> 00:42:28,354
And that's money
for literally doing nothing.

673
00:42:33,061 --> 00:42:35,662
Why wouldn't we just take all of it?

674
00:42:35,664 --> 00:42:38,364
'Cause I'm talking

675
00:42:38,366 --> 00:42:41,701
consistent, reliable profits, you know?

676
00:42:41,703 --> 00:42:45,438
Sure, you can rip me off again,
take all that I've got,

677
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,006
but then I stop selling,

678
00:42:47,008 --> 00:42:49,776
and you lose a valuable revenue stream.

679
00:42:55,784 --> 00:42:57,750
Give me all you got now.

680
00:42:57,752 --> 00:42:59,519
I'm trying to make money
for all of us here.

681
00:42:59,521 --> 00:43:00,887
Just work with me.

682
00:43:00,889 --> 00:43:02,455
Give.

683
00:43:02,457 --> 00:43:04,123
If you could just expand
your thinking a little bit.

684
00:43:04,125 --> 00:43:06,793
You talk too much.

685
00:43:06,795 --> 00:43:10,730
All right, all right,
we got a man of action.

686
00:43:41,229 --> 00:43:43,263
You should have taken the deal.

687
00:43:43,265 --> 00:43:46,399
You're, like, the stupidest
person I've ever met.

688
00:44:39,321 --> 00:44:41,354
Didn't know I had friends, did ya?

689
00:44:43,725 --> 00:44:45,958
So, what's it gonna be... fast or slow?

690
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,660
It's gonna hurt like a bitch either way.

691
00:44:49,898 --> 00:44:53,399
What was that? Was it... slow?

692
00:44:54,188 --> 00:44:55,501
Let me...

693
00:44:55,503 --> 00:44:58,037
Aah!

694
00:44:58,039 --> 00:44:59,972
We're sorry, man, all right? We're sorry!

695
00:45:01,743 --> 00:45:04,054
Yeah, you are, very much so.

696
00:45:04,056 --> 00:45:05,578
Look, we'll leave you alone, okay?

697
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:07,180
We... We won't mess with you anymore.

698
00:45:07,182 --> 00:45:08,748
Easy to say now, but what about tomorrow?

699
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:09,982
I-I-I... I'll swear, man.

700
00:45:09,984 --> 00:45:11,584
I'll swear on anything you want me to.

701
00:45:13,988 --> 00:45:15,221
Cross your heart and hope to die?

702
00:45:15,223 --> 00:45:17,357
Yes. Yes, man.

703
00:45:19,361 --> 00:45:20,426
You mean it?

704
00:45:20,428 --> 00:45:21,527
Yes.

705
00:45:21,529 --> 00:45:23,029
Yes!

706
00:45:23,031 --> 00:45:26,032
Look, after this, you'll never
have to see us again.

707
00:45:26,034 --> 00:45:27,867
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- And you will spread the word

708
00:45:27,869 --> 00:45:29,235
that I'm off limits?

709
00:45:29,237 --> 00:45:30,737
Yes. Yes.

710
00:45:30,739 --> 00:45:32,146
Yes. We'll tell everyone.

711
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:34,715
We'll say, "D-D-Don't mess
with the cellphone guy."

712
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:38,636
All right, we're done.

713
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:41,570
We're done!

714
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:45,850
I think they get it.

715
00:45:46,686 --> 00:45:48,719
Seriously, guys.

716
00:45:48,721 --> 00:45:51,522
We're... We're done.
Okay. We're good, all right?

717
00:45:51,524 --> 00:45:53,557
That's enough.

718
00:45:53,559 --> 00:45:57,728
I appreciate the enthusiasm,
but he got the message.

719
00:45:57,730 --> 00:46:00,064
That's right! L-Listen to what he says.

720
00:46:00,066 --> 00:46:01,899
Listen to what he says.
I got the message.

721
00:46:01,901 --> 00:46:03,501
Uh, you know what?
