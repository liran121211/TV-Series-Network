1093
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:35,360
I'm sorry. I can't do this.

1094
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:38,480
I was...

1095
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:42,070
I was just gonna try to...

1096
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:44,020
I was gonna try to move you all

1097
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:46,720
with my brother's eloquent words,

1098
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:48,780
you know, pull on your heartstrings,

1099
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,820
but it's not right.

1100
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,080
This letter's between me and him,

1101
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:55,620
and it should stay that way.

1102
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,639
Listen, my brother, Chuck...

1103
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:04,760
you... you knew him.

1104
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:08,720
He loved me in his own way.

1105
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:10,900
He loved me as a brother.

1106
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:15,000
He did not love me as a lawyer.

1107
00:55:16,410 --> 00:55:18,740
Big reason I became a lawyer was Chuck.

1108
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:22,610
He was the most brilliant
man I ever knew.

1109
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:24,610
And an incredible lawyer.

1110
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:25,860
You know?

1111
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:29,800
And, uh, he knew exactly
who he was... exactly.

1112
00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:34,600
And all my life, I wanted
to make him proud.

1113
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:40,900
And he was not an easy man
to make proud, you know?

1114
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:44,430
Like climbing Everest without supplies.

1115
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:47,600
If you were one of the lucky
few who reached that peak,

1116
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:50,220
even for a moment, if
you made him proud,

1117
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:53,340
wow, what a feeling.

1118
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:54,440
Whew.

1119
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:56,980
And he let you know it, too.

1120
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:59,960
But if you weren't one
of those people...

1121
00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:03,160
he was polite enough,

1122
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:06,020
but he did not suffer fools, you know?

1123
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:10,020
And he could be
judgmental and difficult.

1124
00:56:10,030 --> 00:56:12,640
And he knew how to get under your skin.

1125
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:17,160
And... could be a real son of a bitch.

was always right...

00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,140

I did lousy in school.

00:56:32,790 --> 00:56:34,330
I lacked ambition.

1135
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:36,600
I always cut corners. I mean, for me

I can try.

I never had a chance
to write him a letter

1155
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:51,580
and to tell him all the
things that I should have.

- They just have to.
