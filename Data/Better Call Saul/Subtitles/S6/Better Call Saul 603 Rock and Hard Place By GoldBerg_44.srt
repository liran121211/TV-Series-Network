<font color="#ff00ff">[SIGHS LIGHTLY]</font>

264

A couple years back,
Jimmy McGill represented

Ignacio Varga,
a local dealer.

266
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:06,770
Now, Varga is a known associate
of Tuco Salamanca.

267
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:09,540
Jimmy was involved
in getting Tuco

268
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,410
a reduced sentence
on an assault and battery charge

269
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,210
shortly after
he represented Varga.

270
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:18,180
And now here he is,
representing Eduardo Salamanca

271
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,090
under the assumed name
"De Guzman."

272
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:22,420
Okay.

What are you
getting at?

274
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:27,930
Are you building some kind of
case against Jimmy?

275
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,260
No.

276
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,930
No one is,
at the moment.

277
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:33,370
"At the moment."

278
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:37,370
Gina Khalil thinks
Jimmy knew who De Guzman was.

279
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:41,410
That Jimmy helped Salamanca
even after he knew.

280
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:44,110
I'd like
to believe he didn't.

281
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:45,880
I don't think Jimmy
ever intended

282
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,420
to become
a cartel lawyer.

283
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,280
It's not a suit
that fits him.

284
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:54,890
I think maybe
he got in over his head

285
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:56,460
and couldn't get out.

286
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,160
And if that's true --
if Salamanca duped him,

287
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:05,000
then the lawyer-client privilege
was obtained in bad faith.

288
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,970
You want Jimmy
to rat on a client?

289
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:11,300
Even if Salamanca's dead,
his privilege survives.

290
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:12,510
You know that.

291
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:14,310
If the privilege
was clean.

292
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:17,180
But if he wasn't in
on the De Guzman deception,

293
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,650
Jimmy could talk to me.

294
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,950
And tell you what?
You just said Salamanca's dead.

295
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:22,750
His accomplices aren't.

296
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:24,980
Salamanca was in deep,
and I want to know

297
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,920
what his people are doing
here in Albuquerque.

298
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,320
And Jimmy could help.

299
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:32,290
I'll make sure
anything he tells me

300
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:33,630
won't blow back.

301
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:37,130
And if it turns out
that Jimmy's made mistakes --

302
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,370
we won't
hold him accountable.

303
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:41,370
I'm talking to you
because I think

304
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:44,270
you'll be more willing
to hear what I have to say.
