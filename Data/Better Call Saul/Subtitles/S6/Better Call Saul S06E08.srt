1
00:03:23,811 --> 00:03:26,422
- No!
- Shh...

2
00:03:29,817 --> 00:03:30,948
Let's talk.

3
00:03:34,474 --> 00:03:36,215
Hey. Hey.
Hey. Hey. Focus.

4
00:03:40,567 --> 00:03:42,177
Hey!

5
00:03:42,351 --> 00:03:44,527
Both of you, sit.

6
00:03:45,876 --> 00:03:47,487
Come on. Sit.

7
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,891
I never turned on you.
I didn't. Never!

8
00:04:01,065 --> 00:04:02,763
I only worked for you
in the desert.

9
00:04:02,937 --> 00:04:05,244
- I was on your side
- the whole time.

10
00:04:08,334 --> 00:04:09,334
Shh.
I don't care.

11
00:04:10,858 --> 00:04:12,207
You two.

12
00:04:12,381 --> 00:04:14,122
God.

13
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:15,602
You two and your mouths.

14
00:04:15,776 --> 00:04:16,776
<i>Dios mio.</i>

15
00:04:18,082 --> 00:04:19,388
Now, you listen.

16
00:04:23,871 --> 00:04:24,871
My car's downstairs.

17
00:04:26,265 --> 00:04:27,745
Press the clicker,
and you'll find it.

18
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:30,834
This is where you are going.

19
00:04:31,008 --> 00:04:33,272
Don't speed, don't weave,

20
00:04:33,446 --> 00:04:34,838
don't cut anyone off.

21
00:04:35,012 --> 00:04:36,052
Just, you know, drive nice.

22
00:04:37,363 --> 00:04:39,408
From here, at this hour,

23
00:04:39,582 --> 00:04:40,801
I'd take Forty East.

24
00:04:40,975 --> 00:04:41,975
Get off at Carlisle.

25
00:04:42,106 --> 00:04:43,151
Take the third left.

26
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:43,978
The rest, I drew a little map

27
00:04:44,152 --> 00:04:45,153
for you on the back.

28
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:46,937
It's not hard.

29
00:04:47,111 --> 00:04:49,418
So, big white brick house
with a solid black door.

30
00:04:49,592 --> 00:04:50,854
You can't miss it.

31
00:04:51,028 --> 00:04:52,595
It's right at the end of the T.

32
00:04:52,769 --> 00:04:54,858
Park a little down the
street, not out in front.

33
00:04:55,032 --> 00:04:57,557
It's a quiet neighborhood,
so you'll have plenty of options.

34
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:59,733
Stating the obvious here, maybe,

35
00:04:59,907 --> 00:05:00,987
but turn the car off, right?

36
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:03,954
So in the glove compartment,

37
00:05:04,128 --> 00:05:04,868
I left you a present.

38
00:05:05,042 --> 00:05:06,042
There's a camera.

39
00:05:06,174 --> 00:05:07,219
And there's a gun.

40
00:05:07,393 --> 00:05:08,002
And you're gonna need both.

41
00:05:08,176 --> 00:05:09,525
A gun?

42
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:11,019
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
but don't worry.

43
00:05:11,179 --> 00:05:12,615
I mean, it's...
it's very easy.

44
00:05:12,789 --> 00:05:14,878
It's a revolver.
It's already loaded, no safety.

45
00:05:15,052 --> 00:05:16,663
It's idiot-proof.

46
00:05:16,837 --> 00:05:18,099
So you go up to that house,

47
00:05:18,273 --> 00:05:20,536
you walk right up
to that black door.

48
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:24,410
Don't run, just be casual,
like a stroll, you know?

49
00:05:24,584 --> 00:05:26,649
Keep the gun somewhere behind
you where they can't see it.

50
00:05:26,673 --> 00:05:29,676
You ring the bell.
You count to three.

51
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,112
You step back.

52
00:05:31,286 --> 00:05:32,486
They look through the peephole,

53
00:05:32,592 --> 00:05:33,712
you're as innocent as can be.

54
00:05:35,072 --> 00:05:36,552
Door opens,

55
00:05:36,726 --> 00:05:39,816
you point and you shoot.

56
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:42,070
And you keep on pulling that
trigger until it's empty.

57
00:05:44,168 --> 00:05:45,168
Simple.

58
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:48,129
Y-You want me to...

59
00:05:48,303 --> 00:05:50,610
I know, I know,

60
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:53,526
you're a lawyer
and not a killer.

61
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,267
But, look,
you can do this, okay?

62
00:05:55,441 --> 00:05:57,660
This guy?
He's a housecat.

63
00:05:57,834 --> 00:06:01,055
Black, medium height.
Short hair. Glasses.

64
00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:02,469
He kinda looks like a librarian.

65
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:04,014
But don't be fooled.

66
00:06:04,188 --> 00:06:05,668
Even a housecat can scratch.

67
00:06:06,626 --> 00:06:08,541
So, that's it.

68
00:06:08,715 --> 00:06:09,759
Hard part's over.

69
00:06:09,933 --> 00:06:11,152
Now you pull out the camera.

70
00:06:11,326 --> 00:06:12,109
Same principle as the gun,

71
00:06:12,284 --> 00:06:13,502
point and shoot.

72
00:06:13,676 --> 00:06:14,895
Take a picture,

73
00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:16,853
one where I can see the face.

74
00:06:17,027 --> 00:06:18,681
Clearly.

75
00:06:18,855 --> 00:06:20,050
And then you bring it back here,

76
00:06:20,074 --> 00:06:22,119
where me and Mrs. Goodman

77
00:06:22,294 --> 00:06:23,556
will be waiting for you.

78
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:26,167
And then you're done!

79
00:06:26,341 --> 00:06:28,604
I'd say it's about a
twenty-minute drive over there,

80
00:06:28,778 --> 00:06:30,171
twenty minutes back.

81
00:06:30,345 --> 00:06:32,434
Maybe ten minutes
to do the job...

82
00:06:32,608 --> 00:06:34,175
Let's call it an hour
all together.

83
00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:36,525
So, you're back here
in an hour or...

84
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:37,744
Send her.

85
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,312
- What?
- She should do it.

86
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:43,576
Jimmy.

87
00:06:46,927 --> 00:06:47,927
Why her?

88
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:50,452
Don't do this.

89
00:06:50,626 --> 00:06:52,976
- Don't do this.
- This guy, the, uh... The housecat.

90
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,935
Jimmy, please.

91
00:06:55,109 --> 00:06:56,956
He looks through his peephole
in the middle of the night.

92
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,155
And he sees me?

93
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,896
"Who's this asshole?"

94
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,202
"What's he doing here?"

95
00:07:01,376 --> 00:07:02,576
Maybe...
Maybe he gets his gun.

96
00:07:02,725 --> 00:07:04,205
Maybe he calls the cops.

97
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:06,076
Either way,
that door stays shut.

98
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,991
- Mmm-mmm.
- But, he sees a woman?

99
00:07:08,165 --> 00:07:09,882
- Mmm-mmm. No.
- She looks like she's in distress.

100
00:07:09,906 --> 00:07:11,952
- Maybe her car broke down.
- Mmm-mmm.

101
00:07:12,126 --> 00:07:14,346
Phew. I mean, you'd open the
door for her, wouldn't you?

102
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,912
Stop. Stop.

103
00:07:16,086 --> 00:07:17,523
Yeah, but...

104
00:07:18,785 --> 00:07:20,090
She's really clever.

105
00:07:20,264 --> 00:07:21,590
How do I know she's gonna
stick to the plan?

106
00:07:21,614 --> 00:07:22,734
- She will.
- No, no, no, no.

107
00:07:22,832 --> 00:07:24,356
- No, no.
- No cops.

108
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,662
- You know she will.
- No.

109
00:07:26,836 --> 00:07:28,577
Look, this doesn't
even make any sense.

110
00:07:28,751 --> 00:07:30,100
I-I've, uh...

111
00:07:30,274 --> 00:07:32,755
I've never shot a gun before.

112
00:07:32,929 --> 00:07:34,429
I've never even - held one.
- Like I have?

113
00:07:34,453 --> 00:07:36,411
Jimmy, what are you doing?

114
00:07:36,585 --> 00:07:37,891
You know she's the best choice.

115
00:07:38,065 --> 00:07:39,719
No, I'm not!
I-I-I can't!

116
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:41,329
- I can't do it.
- She can do it.

117
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:42,828
- You know she can do it.
- No, Jimmy.

118
00:07:42,852 --> 00:07:44,003
- I'll stay. Stop.
- You know I'm right!

119
00:07:44,027 --> 00:07:46,029
Just stop. - Just stop it.
- Listen...

120
00:07:46,203 --> 00:07:48,268
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Oh, my God. Okay, fine, yeah. Her.

121
00:07:48,292 --> 00:07:49,381
Whatever.
Give her the keys.

122
00:07:49,555 --> 00:07:50,860
Give her the address.
Let's go.

123
00:07:54,124 --> 00:07:55,604
Don't. Don't.

124
00:08:00,261 --> 00:08:01,828
You gotta go.

125
00:08:02,002 --> 00:08:04,134
No.

126
00:08:04,308 --> 00:08:05,658
No, don't.
Don't.

127
00:08:08,617 --> 00:08:09,792
Come on.

128
00:08:09,966 --> 00:08:10,967
Hey.

129
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:13,666
Let's go.

130
00:08:26,287 --> 00:08:27,287
Hold on.

131
00:08:33,294 --> 00:08:34,694
You're gonna need
your shoes, right?

132
00:08:59,842 --> 00:09:01,540
There you go.

133
00:09:03,367 --> 00:09:05,369
Okay, so, one hour starting...

134
00:09:05,544 --> 00:09:06,544
now.

135
00:09:08,242 --> 00:09:10,157
Clock's ticking,
Mrs. Goodman.

136
00:09:27,522 --> 00:09:31,483
How does a <i>chichifo</i> like you
land a girl like that, huh?

137
00:09:38,098 --> 00:09:39,098
Now...

138
00:09:41,188 --> 00:09:42,885
What to do with you?

139
00:09:51,154 --> 00:09:52,154
Give me your hands.

140
00:10:06,909 --> 00:10:07,909
Sit.

141
00:10:09,912 --> 00:10:13,612
You know, after I saw
you last, I went home.

142
00:10:14,743 --> 00:10:16,310
My home.

143
00:10:16,484 --> 00:10:17,572
<i>Mi cielito lindo...</i>

144
00:10:19,182 --> 00:10:20,222
And you know what happened?

145
00:10:21,315 --> 00:10:22,403
Men came.

146
00:10:24,144 --> 00:10:26,146
Armed men,

147
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,360
in the middle of the night.

148
00:10:28,801 --> 00:10:29,801
To my home.

149
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,020
Trying to get to me.

150
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:35,716
And you know what they did?

151
00:10:36,939 --> 00:10:39,638
They killed people I care about.

152
00:10:39,812 --> 00:10:42,075
They killed my cook.

153
00:10:42,249 --> 00:10:44,207
My gardener.

154
00:10:44,381 --> 00:10:46,862
A seventeen-year-old kid
I knew since he was knee high.

155
00:10:47,036 --> 00:10:48,777
Never hurt a fly.

156
00:10:48,951 --> 00:10:52,433
Butchered my housekeeper, Yolanda.

157
00:10:52,607 --> 00:10:54,435
<i>Una viejita, cabron.</i>

158
00:10:54,609 --> 00:10:55,610
They shot her in the back.

159
00:10:58,395 --> 00:10:59,395
I'm sorry.

160
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:03,139
Now, how did these men

161
00:11:05,794 --> 00:11:06,795
get into my home?

162
00:11:06,969 --> 00:11:07,969
Do you know?

163
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:12,148
I have, uh, no idea.

164
00:11:13,497 --> 00:11:14,890
Ow.

165
00:11:15,064 --> 00:11:16,064
Ignacio Varga.

166
00:11:17,197 --> 00:11:18,197
He let them in.

167
00:11:20,417 --> 00:11:21,897
And who did Ignacio
introduce me to?

168
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:24,813
You.

169
00:11:27,076 --> 00:11:28,556
Ignacio? Nacho?

170
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,647
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I-I barely know Ignacio!

171
00:11:32,821 --> 00:11:34,431
Whatever he did, he did alone!

172
00:11:34,606 --> 00:11:35,998
Not with me!

173
00:11:36,172 --> 00:11:37,913
Listen, you've got
to believe me.

174
00:11:38,087 --> 00:11:39,447
Hand to God,
I had no part in this.

175
00:11:39,611 --> 00:11:41,917
It wasn't me.
It was... Aah!

176
00:11:42,091 --> 00:11:43,397
Ignacio!

177
00:11:43,571 --> 00:11:45,138
It wasn't me!

178
00:11:45,312 --> 00:11:46,705
Listen. Listen.

179
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,230
Save it.

180
00:11:55,061 --> 00:11:56,061
I'm gonna come back.

181
00:11:57,846 --> 00:12:00,936
And then you are gonna
tell me the whole story.

182
00:12:11,817 --> 00:12:13,906
<i>He's not so bad
as you think he is.</i>

183
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,473
<i>Hello.</i>

184
00:12:16,648 --> 00:12:18,780
<i>Hello, Harry.
We were just talking about you.</i>

185
00:12:18,954 --> 00:12:20,521
<i>Yeah? That ain't
what I pay you for.</i>

186
00:12:20,695 --> 00:12:22,055
<i>She knows enough
about me already.</i>

187
00:12:22,305 --> 00:12:23,305
Ford Taurus.

188
00:12:24,656 --> 00:12:25,656
Taupe.

189
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,078
<i>What do you mean, London or England?
That's the same thing.</i>

190
00:12:36,102 --> 00:12:38,452
<i>It is?</i>

191
00:12:38,626 --> 00:12:40,386
<i>London is in England. London's a city.
England... England's a whole country.</i>

192
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,543
<i>I forgot.</i>
<i>Oh, brother, you've got patience.</i>

193
00:12:42,717 --> 00:12:45,502
<i>Take it easy.</i>
<i>How can anybody get to be so dumb?</i>

194
00:12:45,677 --> 00:12:47,045
<i>Well, we can't
all know everything, Harry.</i>

195
00:12:47,069 --> 00:12:49,376
<i>Who's Tom Paine, for instance?</i>

196
00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:05,542
<i>I didn't read
by him yet, only about him.</i>

197
00:13:05,566 --> 00:13:07,002
<i>But I made a list.</i>

198
00:13:07,176 --> 00:13:08,656
<i>Who's Robert Maranville?</i>

199
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,571
<i>Who? Robert Maranville.</i>

200
00:13:10,745 --> 00:13:12,312
<i>I don't know any Robert.</i>

201
00:13:12,486 --> 00:13:14,053
<i>Think you're so smart, huh?</i>

202
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:16,446
<i>He used to play shortstop
for the Braves, didn't he?</i>

203
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,120
<i>What are you, some kind
of genius or something?</i>

204
00:13:18,144 --> 00:13:19,144
<i>No.</i>

205
00:13:35,422 --> 00:13:36,728
Come on.

206
00:14:13,939 --> 00:14:15,462
Shit.

207
00:14:15,636 --> 00:14:16,985
I knew they had that fire

208
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:19,596
but I thought they'd fix it up.

209
00:14:21,163 --> 00:14:22,861
I got all my
fishing shirts there.

210
00:14:23,035 --> 00:14:24,035
Yeah.

211
00:14:27,213 --> 00:14:29,737
The vented kind?
Yeah.

212
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:32,174
You can get those at REI.

213
00:14:32,348 --> 00:14:33,978
If I want to take out
a second mortgage, I can.

214
00:14:34,002 --> 00:14:35,656
Yeah. Right.

215
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:15,163
Oh! Aah!

216
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:25,478
<i>No, you don't understand.
I have to go back.</i>

217
00:17:25,652 --> 00:17:27,349
<i>What... What are you doing?</i>

218
00:17:27,523 --> 00:17:28,568
<i>I-I have go to...</i>

219
00:17:28,742 --> 00:17:30,222
<i>I have to go back.</i>

220
00:17:30,396 --> 00:17:32,528
<i>Ms. Wexler,
I'd like you to sit down.</i>

221
00:17:34,922 --> 00:17:37,055
<i>He-He'll kill him! You have to...
You-y-y-y-you...</i>

222
00:17:37,229 --> 00:17:39,318
<i>You sit there and be calm.</i>

223
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:40,948
<i>You have to let me go.
I have to get back.</i>

224
00:17:40,972 --> 00:17:42,582
<i>I have to get back!</i>

225
00:17:42,756 --> 00:17:45,280
Sit still and stay calm.

226
00:17:45,454 --> 00:17:48,153
Now, you take a deep breath.
A deep breath.

227
00:17:48,327 --> 00:17:50,894
Nothing's gonna happen here
until you calm yourself.

228
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:52,287
All right?

229
00:17:52,461 --> 00:17:54,855
Now.
Who is killing who?

230
00:17:55,029 --> 00:17:57,249
Lalo Salamanca.

231
00:17:57,423 --> 00:18:01,166
Lalo is going to kill Jimmy.

232
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,882
He's there... H-He is
there with Jimmy now.

233
00:18:02,906 --> 00:18:04,256
Salamanca's at your apartment?

234
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,606
Yes, he sent me!

235
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,825
He... He wanted to send
Jimmy, but then he sent me.

236
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,044
To do what, exactly?

237
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,048
Ms. Wexler,
you stay with me.

238
00:18:14,222 --> 00:18:16,007
What were you
supposed to do here?

239
00:18:21,316 --> 00:18:22,578
Shoot him.

240
00:18:24,406 --> 00:18:26,713
I'm... I'm supposed to
shoot him

241
00:18:26,887 --> 00:18:29,411
and then take a photo and then get back.
That's it.

242
00:18:29,585 --> 00:18:31,370
I only have
20 minutes left, please.

243
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:33,391
- He is alone with him.
- All right. You stay put. You stay put.

244
00:18:33,415 --> 00:18:35,200
We'll handle this.
We will handle this.

245
00:18:35,374 --> 00:18:37,376
You call Tyrus.
Get him to the condo. Now.

246
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,812
You said you were watching us.

247
00:18:38,986 --> 00:18:40,901
Where were you?
Huh?

248
00:18:43,512 --> 00:18:44,600
Who are you people?

249
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,169
Remember what the man said.

250
00:19:12,106 --> 00:19:13,106
You heard all that?

251
00:19:14,978 --> 00:19:16,632
All right.
You hunker down here.

252
00:19:18,939 --> 00:19:20,549
You two, you stay with him.

253
00:19:20,723 --> 00:19:23,378
A dog barks too loud,
you are on the phone with me.

254
00:19:23,552 --> 00:19:24,552
You two come with me.

255
00:19:25,511 --> 00:19:27,034
<i>Please.</i>

256
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,644
<i>Please.
Tell me what's going on.</i>

257
00:19:31,082 --> 00:19:32,082
<i>Please.</i>

258
00:19:33,649 --> 00:19:34,911
<i>Tell me!</i>

259
00:22:01,493 --> 00:22:02,493
Put her on.

260
00:22:04,147 --> 00:22:05,147
<i>For you.</i>

261
00:22:10,241 --> 00:22:11,372
Why did Lalo send you?

262
00:22:13,418 --> 00:22:14,418
<i>Who is this?</i>

263
00:22:14,506 --> 00:22:15,506
<i>Answer him.</i>

264
00:22:19,554 --> 00:22:21,556
<i>He didn't want to send me.
Not at first.</i>

265
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,200
<i>He wanted to send my husband.</i>

266
00:22:27,432 --> 00:22:30,565
<i>But my husband
talked him out of it</i>

267
00:22:30,739 --> 00:22:32,339
<i>because he wanted
to get me out of there.</i>

268
00:22:33,568 --> 00:22:37,093
He talked Lalo out of it.

269
00:22:37,268 --> 00:22:38,268
<i>That's right.</i>

270
00:22:40,923 --> 00:22:42,534
<i>So now I've told you
everything I know.</i>

271
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:44,100
<i>Please. Tell me.</i>

272
00:22:44,275 --> 00:22:45,363
<i>Tell me what's going on.</i>

273
00:22:50,672 --> 00:22:51,847
Come with me, both of you.

274
00:23:17,264 --> 00:23:18,424
Can't get a clear look inside.

275
00:23:19,832 --> 00:23:20,832
Blinds are down...

276
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:22,790
Wait.

277
00:23:25,794 --> 00:23:27,154
Something's
moving around in there.

278
00:23:28,144 --> 00:23:29,189
Can't tell what.

279
00:23:30,277 --> 00:23:31,409
Copy that.

280
00:23:33,367 --> 00:23:34,367
Report.

281
00:23:35,717 --> 00:23:37,632
<i>North corner, clear.</i>

282
00:23:37,806 --> 00:23:39,591
<i>Rear stairwell, all clear.</i>

283
00:23:39,765 --> 00:23:41,288
<i>Clear, east side.</i>

284
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:43,072
<i>West side, clear.</i>

285
00:23:43,246 --> 00:23:44,683
<i>Street, clear.</i>

286
00:23:44,857 --> 00:23:46,337
<i>Parking, all clear.</i>

287
00:23:46,511 --> 00:23:48,817
<i>Clear on the south.</i>

288
00:23:48,991 --> 00:23:50,558
All right, hold the perimeter.

289
00:23:50,732 --> 00:23:52,952
Everyone else, on me.
Eyes sharp.

290
00:23:53,126 --> 00:23:54,214
Nice and easy.

291
00:23:54,388 --> 00:23:56,129
We don't wanna spook
the neighbors.

292
00:25:22,128 --> 00:25:23,128
All quiet, sir.

293
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:35,251
Is there something
we should be looking for?

294
00:27:10,541 --> 00:27:11,542
Hey.

295
00:27:11,716 --> 00:27:13,326
Hey. Hey!

296
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:16,416
She's fine. She's safe.

297
00:27:17,983 --> 00:27:19,288
Now, the gag is gonna come off,

298
00:27:19,462 --> 00:27:21,290
and I need to ask you
a question,

299
00:27:21,464 --> 00:27:23,597
and I need you to answer it
quietly. Got it?

300
00:27:24,555 --> 00:27:25,556
- Mm.
- Huh?

301
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:26,730
- Mm!
- Yeah.

302
00:27:30,996 --> 00:27:34,303
All right. I need to know
where Salamanca went

303
00:27:34,477 --> 00:27:37,437
and I need to know exactly
how long he's been gone.

304
00:27:37,611 --> 00:27:39,134
Uh... I don't...

305
00:27:40,745 --> 00:27:42,007
I don't know where he went.

306
00:27:43,182 --> 00:27:45,271
He left right after she did.

307
00:28:00,329 --> 00:28:01,329
Ah.

308
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:17,352
Okay.

309
00:31:17,526 --> 00:31:19,093
Drumroll, please.

310
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:27,319
<i>Ta-da!</i>

311
00:31:28,711 --> 00:31:29,974
Wow! No?

312
00:33:17,342 --> 00:33:18,517
Hoo, hoo!

313
00:34:10,134 --> 00:34:14,529
I understand blood for blood.

314
00:34:16,575 --> 00:34:18,185
Hector?

315
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:20,013
I kept him alive.

316
00:34:21,623 --> 00:34:23,495
Kept him broken.

317
00:34:23,669 --> 00:34:24,749
I will save him to the last.

318
00:34:26,672 --> 00:34:31,416
Before he dies, he will know

319
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:35,159
I buried every one of you.

320
00:34:40,903 --> 00:34:41,904
Big talk.

321
00:34:43,906 --> 00:34:44,906
You done?

322
00:34:46,735 --> 00:34:48,215
No.

323
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:49,564
Not yet.

324
00:38:03,845 --> 00:38:05,151
<i>Pollos Hermanos Pollos Hermanos</i>

325
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:09,242
<i>Delicious chicken
grilled and fried</i>

326
00:38:09,416 --> 00:38:13,899
<i>Pollos Hermanos Pollos Hermanos</i>

327
00:38:14,073 --> 00:38:16,989
<i>It will leave you satisfied</i>

328
00:38:27,869 --> 00:38:29,306
Mr. Fring!

329
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,916
I just walked through the door.

330
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:32,222
I'm not running late, am I?

331
00:38:32,396 --> 00:38:34,876
<i>No, Lyle.
Punctual as always.</i>

332
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:38,576
Oh, okay. Good. Uh, what
can I do for you, sir?

333
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:41,143
<i>I won't be in today,
I'm sorry to say.</i>

334
00:38:41,318 --> 00:38:43,058
<i>In fact, you won't be
seeing me all week.</i>

335
00:38:43,233 --> 00:38:43,972
<i>I've been called out of town.</i>

336
00:38:44,146 --> 00:38:45,452
<i>Family emergency.</i>

337
00:38:45,626 --> 00:38:47,062
Oh, no.
I'm... I'm so sorry.

338
00:38:47,237 --> 00:38:49,717
Uh, is there anything I can do?

339
00:38:49,891 --> 00:38:51,458
Do you need a ride
to the airport?

340
00:38:51,632 --> 00:38:53,373
<i>Nothing like that.</i>

341
00:38:53,547 --> 00:38:55,984
<i>I need you to act as
store manager in my stead.</i>

342
00:38:56,158 --> 00:38:58,030
<i>Unfortunately,
at this late date,</i>

343
00:38:58,204 --> 00:39:03,253
<i>this will require you to both
open and close today and tomorrow.</i>

344
00:39:03,427 --> 00:39:05,167
Sure. Yes.
I can do that.

345
00:39:05,342 --> 00:39:08,170
<i>Would you be able to set next
week's schedule by close tomorrow?</i>

346
00:39:08,345 --> 00:39:11,652
I like to give the employees
time to prepare.

347
00:39:11,826 --> 00:39:14,133
<i>I'll take care of it.
Don't give it a thought.</i>

348
00:39:14,307 --> 00:39:18,268
I will adjust your pay for the
extra hours upon my return.

349
00:39:18,442 --> 00:39:20,618
I hope that that is acceptable.

350
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:22,272
<i>Of course.
Not a problem.</i>

351
00:39:22,446 --> 00:39:24,839
<i>Uh, if there's
anything else I can do,</i>

352
00:39:25,013 --> 00:39:26,513
<i>like anything at all,
just please let me know.</i>

353
00:39:26,537 --> 00:39:29,017
I know I have nothing
to worry about.

354
00:39:29,191 --> 00:39:31,150
The restaurant is
in your capable hands.

355
00:39:31,324 --> 00:39:32,760
<i>Well, safe travels,
Mr. Fring.</i>

356
00:39:32,934 --> 00:39:33,935
Goodbye, Lyle.

357
00:39:35,981 --> 00:39:37,939
Doc just crossed the border.

358
00:39:38,113 --> 00:39:39,233
He'll be here in three hours.

359
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:45,643
Sir, you should remain prone.

360
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:47,470
Sam.

361
00:40:08,796 --> 00:40:10,676
You happy with the way
things went down tonight?

362
00:40:11,799 --> 00:40:12,799
'Cause I'm not.

363
00:40:14,976 --> 00:40:17,283
How'd you know Lalo
would be at the laundry?

364
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:18,457
I didn't.

365
00:40:21,243 --> 00:40:24,029
Well, the next time you get a
wild hair to play detective,

366
00:40:24,203 --> 00:40:25,944
tell me.

367
00:40:26,118 --> 00:40:27,998
This could have gone down
a whole lot different.

368
00:40:31,558 --> 00:40:32,733
It could have.

369
00:40:55,408 --> 00:40:56,583
Yeah?

370
00:40:58,237 --> 00:40:59,673
Okay. I'm on it.

371
00:42:11,441 --> 00:42:13,921
What are you doing?

372
00:42:14,095 --> 00:42:15,662
You're getting
a new refrigerator.

373
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:18,839
I'm assuming stainless will do.

374
00:42:22,452 --> 00:42:23,888
- Arthur.
- Yeah, Mike?

375
00:42:24,062 --> 00:42:25,062
Gloves on.

376
00:42:49,174 --> 00:42:50,697
Downstairs.

377
00:42:50,871 --> 00:42:52,569
Green Jaguar, vanity plates.

378
00:42:52,743 --> 00:42:53,787
It goes to the warehouse.

379
00:42:53,961 --> 00:42:54,961
Done.

380
00:42:59,793 --> 00:43:01,578
Lalo said he was coming back.

381
00:43:01,752 --> 00:43:03,294
- He's not coming.
- No. But he said he was.

382
00:43:03,318 --> 00:43:05,277
He told me...
You understand me.

383
00:43:05,451 --> 00:43:07,540
He is not coming back.

384
00:43:09,411 --> 00:43:10,411
Let's sit.

385
00:43:12,371 --> 00:43:13,459
Sit.

386
00:43:22,555 --> 00:43:25,906
All right, here's
what's gonna happen.

387
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,518
In a few days, Howard
Hamlin's car will be found

388
00:43:28,692 --> 00:43:31,912
several states away,
by the water.

389
00:43:32,086 --> 00:43:36,526
The odometer will have rolled to the exact
number of miles it took to get there.

390
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,571
There will be cocaine
in the upholstery.

391
00:43:40,442 --> 00:43:42,642
That's the story you were
setting up for this guy, yeah?

392
00:43:44,664 --> 00:43:46,057
They'll call it a suicide,

393
00:43:46,231 --> 00:43:48,320
hoping the body
will come washing up.

394
00:43:48,494 --> 00:43:50,627
It never will.

395
00:43:50,801 --> 00:43:52,846
At some point,
you're gonna hear about it.

396
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:56,458
Someone calls you, someone
at the courthouse mentions it.

397
00:43:56,633 --> 00:43:59,592
The moment that happens,
you call the cops.

398
00:43:59,766 --> 00:44:02,421
His car was here
for hours last night.

399
00:44:02,595 --> 00:44:05,119
Good chance somebody noticed it.

400
00:44:05,293 --> 00:44:07,382
That means you are the last
people to see him alive.

401
00:44:09,602 --> 00:44:10,962
Cops are gonna
wanna hear from you.

402
00:44:11,082 --> 00:44:13,084
You tell the cops you saw him.

403
00:44:13,258 --> 00:44:14,738
He came here.

404
00:44:14,912 --> 00:44:17,175
Seemed like maybe
he was chemically altered.

405
00:44:17,349 --> 00:44:19,177
Didn't make a lick of sense.

406
00:44:19,351 --> 00:44:21,919
Then he left.
That's all you know.

407
00:44:22,093 --> 00:44:24,617
You keep telling the lie
that you've been telling.

408
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,102
Now, Ms. Wexler tells me
she has court at 10:00.

409
00:44:31,276 --> 00:44:32,276
What's on your docket?

410
00:44:34,801 --> 00:44:36,629
Hey. Listen.

411
00:44:36,803 --> 00:44:39,066
Where do you need to be?

412
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,679
Uh... Office.
My office.

413
00:44:42,853 --> 00:44:44,637
Clients start showing up
around 9:30.

414
00:44:45,899 --> 00:44:47,422
Oh, my car's gone.

415
00:44:47,597 --> 00:44:48,902
No. It's on
the way home.

416
00:44:49,076 --> 00:44:51,426
You'll have it when you need it.

417
00:44:51,601 --> 00:44:53,994
So, you two are gonna
go about your day.

418
00:44:54,168 --> 00:44:55,213
Normal. Same as ever.

419
00:44:57,128 --> 00:44:59,173
Today, you're Meryl Streep
and Laurence Olivier.

420
00:45:00,392 --> 00:45:02,394
No staring into space.

421
00:45:02,568 --> 00:45:04,875
Nothing out of the ordinary.
You cover.

422
00:45:05,049 --> 00:45:07,007
Anybody talks to you,

423
00:45:07,181 --> 00:45:09,141
it's just another day that
ends in "Y," that's all.

424
00:45:10,707 --> 00:45:12,404
When you get home, we'll be gone

425
00:45:12,578 --> 00:45:14,218
and everything will be
back the way it was.

426
00:45:15,712 --> 00:45:20,673
Now, I need
to impress upon you...

427
00:45:20,847 --> 00:45:22,240
None of this ever happened.

428
00:45:23,763 --> 00:45:24,763
None of it.

429
00:45:26,331 --> 00:45:27,331
Understand?

430
00:45:29,203 --> 00:45:30,857
Say it out loud.
I need to hear it.

431
00:45:31,031 --> 00:45:32,031
We understand.

432
00:45:34,513 --> 00:45:35,513
It never happened.

433
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:39,170
All right,
I'm gonna go out there

434
00:45:39,344 --> 00:45:40,911
and you're gonna get ready.

435
00:45:41,085 --> 00:45:42,782
Before I shut that door,

436
00:45:42,956 --> 00:45:44,717
is there anything you need
from the other room?

437
00:45:44,741 --> 00:45:47,134
Toiletries? Clothes?
Anything to start your day?

438
00:45:47,308 --> 00:45:48,701
No.

439
00:45:48,875 --> 00:45:49,875
We're set.

440
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,528
Hold it.

441
00:47:56,263 --> 00:47:57,351
Go ahead.

442
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,400
Easy.
