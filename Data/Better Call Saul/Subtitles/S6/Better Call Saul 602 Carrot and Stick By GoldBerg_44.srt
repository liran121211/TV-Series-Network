334
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,330
A big one.

335
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,300
Big.

336
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,850
Okay, then.

337
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,430
Let's hear it.

338
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,640
Let's hold your horses

339
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,360
because we've been
down this road before,

340
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,780
and the last time
I gave you two advice,

341
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,570
you went straight
to the competition with it.

342
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,430
So I just need some assurances

343
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,430
that all my hard work
isn't gonna end up

344
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,400
in the hands of, uh,
Clifford Main

345
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,910
or some other asshole

346
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,290
at some pretentious

347
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:52,880

349
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,290
Yeah.
Yeah, you remember these.

350
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:57,570
I made some updates.

351
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:59,910
Just closed a few loopholes
and whatnot.

352
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:03,330
So, uh...
We're not signing anything.

353
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,600

what I know, so...

We're not signing.

You're sure?

00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:15,080
Yep.

358
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:17,670

00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:09,010
being a certain

No, not Kim Wexler.
No.

Craig's lead attorney.

396
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,770

Oh.

398
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:22,250
But he was so professional

00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,250
and...
And... energetic.

400
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,700
Upbeat.

401
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,910
Oooooh.

402
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,560
"Ooooh" is right.

403
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,910
So upbeat is bad...?

404
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:33,590
In this case,
it's textbook malpractice.

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,460
I believe the magic phrase

406
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,900
is "ineffective

If your guy wasn't nose deep
in the devil's dandruff,

00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:44,320
well, Craig's case would have
turned out completely different.

00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,590
Oh, my God.

410
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:49,630
Don't we need
some kind of proof?

411
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:51,900
All the dirty laundry
comes out in discovery.

412
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:53,770
Mm.

413
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:55,770
Mm-hmm.
...secret drug deals.

414
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:57,630
All we got to do
is get the ball rolling.

415
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,490
So I say we get started
on your affidavits.

416
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,590
Yes. Yes.
About that...

417
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:04,770

about our rights,
Mr. McGill.

419

what you force us to sign.

You... Yeah.

504

...certain things during my incarceration.
Yeah.

505
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,440
I mean, it was pretty much
common knowledge

506
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,090
out in the yard.
Out in the yard. Yeah.

507
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:34,130
Common knowledge.
Out in the yard. Yes.

508
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:36,780
Yeah. Those drug people can
spot each other a mile away.

509
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:39,440
They just know.
Yeah.

510
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,260
Did you have any evidence
to support this?

511
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:47,060
Well, it will all come out
in discovery. Discovery.

512
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,060
All his drug purchases,

513
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:51,440
his drug associates, mm-hmm...

514
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,470
All of that gets on the record
during discovery.

515
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,640
Discovery.
Yeah.

516
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,890

to come see us.

525
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:16,610
Unfortunately, I don't think
we're gonna be able to help.

526
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:19,470
Our firm is partnering with HHM
on another case,

527
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:22,680
so this would be
a clear conflict of interest.

528
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,640
Partnering with them?

529
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,500
Well, surely that will change

530
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,640
now that you know the facts.

You're gonna have
a difficult time pursuing this

534
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:36,470
no matter who your lawyer is.

535
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:39,360
Overturning a conviction
in a case like Craig's

536
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:40,750
is extremely difficult.

537
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,160

were true...

And I got to tell ya,

539
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:47,330
it does not sound like
the Howard Hamlin that I know...

540
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:49,920
It is unlikely
that you will succeed.

541
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:54,540

There is not a whiff of him.

828
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:05,710
Now, my guess is
he's smart enough to know

829
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:08,190
it's not in
the Salamanca family interests

830
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:10,370
to take you out without a reason

831
00:48:10,370 --> 00:48:12,260
the bosses can get behind.

832
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:15,230
So the odds are,
he's searching for Varga.

833
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:18,570
Finds him alive,
gets him to talk...

834
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:22,990
Varga's alone
in foreign territory.

835
00:48:22,990 --> 00:48:24,570
No one he can trust.

836

but he's not gonna last.

837
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:31,430
