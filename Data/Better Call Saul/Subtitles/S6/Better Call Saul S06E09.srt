1
00:00:06,484 --> 00:00:08,486
Previously on
"Better Call Saul"...

2
00:00:13,143 --> 00:00:15,145
You done?
Not yet.

3
00:00:18,801 --> 00:00:20,977
Mike: In a few days,
Howard Hamlin's car

4
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,892
will be found several states
away.

5
00:00:22,935 --> 00:00:25,242
There will be cocaine in
the upholstery.

6
00:00:25,286 --> 00:00:27,723
That's the story you were
setting up for this guy, yeah?

7
00:00:27,766 --> 00:00:30,073
So, you two are gonna
go about your day,

8
00:00:30,117 --> 00:00:32,380
normal, same as ever.

9
00:00:32,423 --> 00:00:35,687
You keep telling the lie
that you've been telling.

10
00:00:52,182 --> 00:01:00,182
It's the per-r-r-r-fe-e-e-e-ct

11
00:01:02,018 --> 00:01:08,068
Wa-a-a-a-a-a-a-y

12
00:01:09,373 --> 00:01:16,728
To end a per-r-r-r-fe-e-e-e-ct

13
00:01:18,513 --> 00:01:23,300
Da-a-a-a-a-y

14
00:01:26,303 --> 00:01:34,303
It's the per-r-r-r-fe-e-e-e-ct

15
00:01:35,573 --> 00:01:42,624
Wa-a-a-a-a-a-a-y

16
00:01:42,667 --> 00:01:50,667
To end a per-r-r-r-fe-e-e-e-ct

17
00:01:52,024 --> 00:01:56,812
Da-a-a-a-a-y

18
00:01:58,335 --> 00:02:00,642
Ride with me

19
00:02:00,685 --> 00:02:02,426
Glide with me

20
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:06,778
Stay by my side with me

21
00:02:06,822 --> 00:02:10,260
Through the night

22
00:02:15,178 --> 00:02:17,876
Ride on the wings

23
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,707
Of the angels of love

24
00:02:22,751 --> 00:02:27,190
Who are on our side

25
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:34,676
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh

26
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:41,465
It's the per-r-r-r-fe-e-e-e-ct

27
00:02:43,859 --> 00:02:51,127
Wa-a-a-a-a-a-a-y

28
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:59,171
To end a per-r-r-r-fe-e-e-e-ct

29
00:03:00,528 --> 00:03:01,703
Da-a-a-a-a-y

30
00:03:01,746 --> 00:03:05,533
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh

31
00:03:05,576 --> 00:03:07,491
Ahh, ahh, ahh

32
00:03:07,535 --> 00:03:15,535
It's the per-r-r-r-fe-e-e-e-ct

33
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:22,593
Wa-a-a-a-a-a-a-y

34
00:03:24,029 --> 00:03:31,036
To end a per-r-r-r-fe-e-e-e-ct

35
00:03:33,387 --> 00:03:36,955
Da-a-a-a-a-y

36
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,656
Ride with me

37
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:43,527
Glide with me

38
00:03:43,571 --> 00:03:50,969
Stay by my side
through the night

39
00:03:56,192 --> 00:03:59,151
Ride on the wings

40
00:03:59,195 --> 00:04:03,982
Of the angels of love

41
00:04:04,026 --> 00:04:08,683
Who are on our side

42
00:04:08,726 --> 00:04:14,254
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh

43
00:04:30,357 --> 00:04:33,577
To say

44
00:04:34,665 --> 00:04:37,451
I

45
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,847
Love

46
00:04:42,891 --> 00:04:45,285
You

47
00:06:32,566 --> 00:06:34,568
One day, we'll, uh...

48
00:06:36,961 --> 00:06:38,702
we'll wake up
and brush our teeth

49
00:06:38,746 --> 00:06:40,661
and we'll go to work...

50
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:47,711
and at some point
we'll suddenly realize...

51
00:06:47,755 --> 00:06:50,627
that we haven't thought
about it at all.

52
00:06:50,671 --> 00:06:52,412
None of it.

53
00:06:55,153 --> 00:06:57,329
And that's when we'll know.

54
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,856
We'll know we can forget.

55
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,920
Gus: Don Eladio.

56
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:27,104
Don Juan.

57
00:10:27,148 --> 00:10:29,106
Gustavo.

58
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,937
Don Hector.

59
00:10:47,211 --> 00:10:49,953
Gustavo...

60
00:14:47,756 --> 00:14:49,366
"Ding! Ding! Ding!
Ding! Ding! Ding!

61
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:52,195
Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding!
Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding!"

62
00:14:52,239 --> 00:14:55,111
"Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding!"

63
00:14:55,155 --> 00:14:57,897
Ay, ay, ay.

64
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:01,248
Ahh.

65
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:55,171
Bueno.

66
00:15:55,215 --> 00:15:57,086
Gustavo...

67
00:17:51,722 --> 00:17:54,247
The doc left these for you,

68
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:57,815
in the event
that you made it back alive.

69
00:17:57,859 --> 00:17:59,774
Tell me about the lawyers.

70
00:17:59,817 --> 00:18:02,124
Well, they spent a full
afternoon with the cops.

71
00:18:02,168 --> 00:18:05,301
Played it as they were told.
Maybe a bit better.

72
00:18:05,345 --> 00:18:07,390
The APD consensus is

73
00:18:07,434 --> 00:18:10,350
he walked into the ocean
and killed himself.

74
00:18:11,438 --> 00:18:15,094
Without a body,
they can't close the file,

75
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:19,446
but for all practical purposes
it's over.

76
00:18:19,489 --> 00:18:21,839
When can construction resume?

77
00:18:27,018 --> 00:18:29,412
We need to find a new engineer

78
00:18:29,456 --> 00:18:31,501
and a crew to do the work.

79
00:18:32,589 --> 00:18:34,156
That could take some time.

80
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,200
Start today.

81
00:19:14,936 --> 00:19:17,286
Bartender:
Mr. Fring. Welcome back.

82
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:20,115
Well, thank you, Brett.

83
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,683
What can I get you?

84
00:19:22,726 --> 00:19:24,206
Wine, to start.

85
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,903
Yes, sir.

86
00:19:29,037 --> 00:19:30,952
A glass of the
Dressler & Vaughn, please.

87
00:19:30,995 --> 00:19:32,997
Right away.

88
00:19:58,936 --> 00:20:01,287
Mr. Fring.

89
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:02,897
It's so good to see you.

90
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,159
It's been a while.

91
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,639
Yes. Too long.

92
00:20:05,682 --> 00:20:06,857
What are you drinking?

93
00:20:06,901 --> 00:20:08,250
The Dressler & Vaughn.

94
00:20:08,294 --> 00:20:09,556
How is it?

95
00:20:11,297 --> 00:20:12,994
Enough said.

96
00:20:13,037 --> 00:20:14,300
Brett?

97
00:20:14,343 --> 00:20:18,260
Can you get that bottle
from before?

98
00:20:18,304 --> 00:20:22,003
Now, normally,
we would never have this open,

99
00:20:22,046 --> 00:20:26,268
but a couple hours ago,
I smelled cigar smoke.

100
00:20:26,312 --> 00:20:27,530
And I look up

101
00:20:27,574 --> 00:20:30,011
and this Cadillac cowboy
is rolling in,

102
00:20:30,054 --> 00:20:31,534
puffing on a Monte Cristo.

103
00:20:31,578 --> 00:20:34,711
And, I mean,
we're talking the full deal.

104
00:20:34,755 --> 00:20:37,018
You know, Stetson
and ostrich skin boots,

105
00:20:37,061 --> 00:20:38,715
the belt buckle
the size of Utah.

106
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:42,415
On his arm, there's a...
A young woman

107
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:46,506
who somehow poured herself
into the tightest dress

108
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:47,898
that I have ever seen...

109
00:20:47,942 --> 00:20:52,990
Anyway, he clearly
wants to impress his date,

110
00:20:53,034 --> 00:20:55,297
so he orders this.

111
00:20:55,341 --> 00:20:57,299
He takes one sip,

112
00:20:57,343 --> 00:20:59,301
and sends it back.

113
00:20:59,345 --> 00:21:01,434
For a rum and Coke.

114
00:21:01,477 --> 00:21:03,436
DietCoke.
What can I say?

115
00:21:03,479 --> 00:21:07,004
But his loss

116
00:21:07,048 --> 00:21:09,572
is definitely your gain.

117
00:21:34,554 --> 00:21:36,686
Remarkable.
Mm-hmm.

118
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:38,209
I thought you'd like it.

119
00:21:38,253 --> 00:21:40,473
It is from the birthplace
of Syrah, Côte-Rtie.

120
00:21:40,516 --> 00:21:45,652
This one is Rene Rostaing's
La Landonne.

121
00:21:46,783 --> 00:21:49,612
So, I'm in college.

122
00:21:49,656 --> 00:21:51,745
And I make it to Europe,
my first time.

123
00:21:51,788 --> 00:21:56,576
And I got a little enthusiastic
with my Eurail pass.

124
00:21:56,619 --> 00:22:02,451
Long story short, I get lost.

125
00:22:02,495 --> 00:22:04,714
And I mean really lost.

126
00:22:04,758 --> 00:22:07,543
It is the middle of the night,
pitch black.

127
00:22:07,587 --> 00:22:09,545
I'm standing on
this cobblestone street

128
00:22:09,589 --> 00:22:11,852
with my backpack
and there's no one around.

129
00:22:11,895 --> 00:22:15,377
I mean, I have absolutely
no idea where I am.

130
00:22:15,421 --> 00:22:18,119
Finally, I get to
this stand of cedar trees

131
00:22:18,162 --> 00:22:21,644
and I just go ahead and roll out
the sleeping bag.

132
00:22:21,688 --> 00:22:24,299
And the next morning I wake up

133
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,520
and...

134
00:22:27,563 --> 00:22:29,043
I'm in paradise.

135
00:22:29,086 --> 00:22:30,044
Ampuis.

136
00:22:30,087 --> 00:22:31,872
It's... It's...

137
00:22:31,915 --> 00:22:34,527
It's this perfect little village
in the southeast.

138
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:38,052
It's... It's surrounded by
vineyards, everything's... green.

139
00:22:38,095 --> 00:22:41,098
They call it the ancient gateway
to the Rhône Valley.

140
00:22:41,142 --> 00:22:45,102
They've been making wine there
since Roman times.

141
00:22:45,146 --> 00:22:46,190
Am I talking too much?

142
00:22:46,234 --> 00:22:47,540
No, not at all.

143
00:22:50,456 --> 00:22:53,241
The vineyards are so steep

144
00:22:53,284 --> 00:22:55,417
they can't get tractors
up there, so they use horses.

145
00:22:55,461 --> 00:22:58,377
Still, to this day.

146
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,422
Do you get that, um...

147
00:23:00,466 --> 00:23:04,905
That meaty... it's
almost bloody flavor?

148
00:23:04,948 --> 00:23:09,388
The soil is all iron oxide
and manganese.

149
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:12,086
You can taste it
in the glass, right?

150
00:23:15,568 --> 00:23:17,918
I have a confession to make.

151
00:23:17,961 --> 00:23:19,441
About a year ago,

152
00:23:19,485 --> 00:23:23,967
you mentioned a rare vintage
from the same region.

153
00:23:24,011 --> 00:23:26,448
1978?
Yes. Exactly.

154
00:23:26,492 --> 00:23:31,888
And I must say, you paint
a compelling picture.

155
00:23:33,499 --> 00:23:37,198
I went home that night,
and I bought a bottle.

156
00:23:37,241 --> 00:23:39,287
A 1978 Côte-Rtie?

157
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:41,507
Mm-hmm.

158
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:44,248
Mr. Fring,
that must... Gustavo.

159
00:23:44,292 --> 00:23:45,946
Gustavo.

160
00:23:45,989 --> 00:23:49,166
I'm saving it
for a special occasion.

161
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:51,734
Well, I would love
to hear about it...

162
00:23:51,778 --> 00:23:53,997
when you have that occasion.

163
00:23:58,001 --> 00:24:00,526
Hold on. There's something
I have to show you.

164
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:02,266
The owner bought a bottle
of Guigal.

165
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,877
I can't open it. Of course.

166
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,053
But the bottle itself is...

167
00:24:06,096 --> 00:24:08,664
You'll appreciate this.
I'll be right back.

168
00:24:56,625 --> 00:24:59,280
Brett.

169
00:24:59,323 --> 00:25:02,022
Would you let David know
that I've been called away?

170
00:25:02,065 --> 00:25:03,589
Brett:
Of course, Mr. Fring.

171
00:25:03,632 --> 00:25:06,330
Have a good evening. Thank you.

172
00:28:34,582 --> 00:28:35,931
Yes?

173
00:28:35,975 --> 00:28:38,281
Mike: Mr. Varga,
you don't know me,

174
00:28:38,325 --> 00:28:41,023
but I'd like to talk
about your son.

175
00:28:43,112 --> 00:28:45,811
My son?

176
00:28:45,854 --> 00:28:47,421
What happened?

177
00:28:47,464 --> 00:28:50,772
Maybe we could talk
face-to-face...?

178
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,731
I'm outside.

179
00:29:08,137 --> 00:29:09,835
Who are you?

180
00:29:09,878 --> 00:29:13,142
It's not important.

181
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:20,193
I saw you here before.

182
00:29:20,236 --> 00:29:22,325
Chrysler Fifth Avenue.

183
00:29:27,026 --> 00:29:29,332
What about my son?

184
00:29:30,856 --> 00:29:34,816
I'm sorry.
He won't be found.

185
00:29:42,171 --> 00:29:44,652
It was over fast.

186
00:29:44,695 --> 00:29:46,610
No pain.

187
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:52,051
You were there?

188
00:29:52,094 --> 00:29:53,922
I wasthere.

189
00:29:55,881 --> 00:29:57,621
Your son made some mistakes.

190
00:29:57,665 --> 00:30:00,842
He fell in with bad people.

191
00:30:00,886 --> 00:30:05,151
But he was never like them,
not really.

192
00:30:05,194 --> 00:30:07,457
He had a good heart.

193
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,855
One more thing.

194
00:30:13,899 --> 00:30:17,728
You won't have to worry
about the Salamancas.

195
00:30:17,772 --> 00:30:20,427
Their day is coming.

196
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:22,342
There will be justice.

197
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:27,347
Justice?

198
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:29,566
I'm sorry.
My Spanish.

199
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:32,395
J-Justicia.
Justice.

200
00:30:39,011 --> 00:30:42,753
What you talk about
is not justice.

201
00:30:44,016 --> 00:30:47,367
What you talk of is revenge.

202
00:30:53,677 --> 00:30:56,245
It never ends.

203
00:31:00,249 --> 00:31:02,773
My boy is gone.

204
00:31:44,032 --> 00:31:45,947
Oh, they got a new trashcan.

205
00:31:51,344 --> 00:31:54,129
We'll just put in an appearance.

206
00:31:54,173 --> 00:31:55,870
Twenty minutes tops.

207
00:31:57,045 --> 00:31:59,656
We can get through
twenty minutes of anything.

208
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:17,152
There's Julie and Francis.

209
00:32:17,196 --> 00:32:20,199
Hey, Kim.
Hey, guys.

210
00:32:20,242 --> 00:32:22,201
Jimmy.

211
00:32:56,278 --> 00:32:58,672
I always admired him.
Always.

212
00:32:58,715 --> 00:33:00,413
Even when...

213
00:33:00,456 --> 00:33:03,807
I mean, nobody could relate
to a client quite like he could.

214
00:33:03,851 --> 00:33:06,027
And it wasn't an act.
He genuinely cared.

215
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,555
I never saw it coming...

216
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:14,122
Addiction is a disease.

217
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:18,083
He was a good lawyer
and a hell of a guy.

218
00:33:18,126 --> 00:33:19,606
What else is there to say?

219
00:33:19,649 --> 00:33:22,435
It still
doesn't seem real.Mm.

220
00:33:22,478 --> 00:33:25,133
I mean, I...

221
00:33:25,177 --> 00:33:28,136
expect to see him
charging down those stairs

222
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:31,139
with a big grin on his face.

223
00:33:32,749 --> 00:33:35,622
You know,
this is probably the last time

224
00:33:35,665 --> 00:33:37,363
any of us will be
in this building.

225
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:40,496
Why is that?

226
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,542
Uh, HMM is downsizing.

227
00:33:42,585 --> 00:33:44,065
Seriously? Yep.

228
00:33:44,109 --> 00:33:46,589
They're gonna take
half a floor downtown.Hmm.

229
00:33:46,633 --> 00:33:50,202
And they're changing their name.

230
00:33:50,245 --> 00:33:52,682
Changing their name to what?

231
00:33:52,726 --> 00:33:56,295
Uh... Brookner Partners?

232
00:33:56,338 --> 00:33:58,732
Something like that.

233
00:33:58,775 --> 00:34:01,604
End of an era.

234
00:34:01,648 --> 00:34:03,171
Yeah.

235
00:34:05,217 --> 00:34:06,566
Have you spoken to Cheryl?

236
00:34:06,609 --> 00:34:09,264
Um, not yet.

237
00:34:09,308 --> 00:34:12,702
To not even have a body
to put in the ground...

238
00:34:12,746 --> 00:34:15,227
I heard she took a leave
from her practice.

239
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:22,277
Maybe we should go up there
and pay our respects.

240
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:25,193
Yeah.

241
00:34:25,237 --> 00:34:27,543
Rich, good to see you.

242
00:34:27,587 --> 00:34:28,999
I wish it was under
better circumstances.

243
00:34:29,023 --> 00:34:30,981
You too, Kim.
Take care.

244
00:34:31,025 --> 00:34:34,420
Jimmy... ah, Saul.

245
00:34:34,463 --> 00:34:36,204
Bye, Rich.

246
00:35:00,446 --> 00:35:01,708
Cliff.

247
00:35:01,751 --> 00:35:04,537
Kim. Jimmy. Kim, hi.

248
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:08,454
Hi, Cheryl.
Um, I'm Jimmy McGill.

249
00:35:08,497 --> 00:35:11,805
You may not remember me.
I'm Chuck McGill's brother.

250
00:35:11,848 --> 00:35:13,111
Of course.

251
00:35:14,547 --> 00:35:17,158
Very sorry for your loss.

252
00:35:18,725 --> 00:35:20,292
Cheryl, I'm so sorry.

253
00:35:20,335 --> 00:35:23,686
I can't even imagine
what you must be going through.

254
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:27,037
If Jimmy and I can do anything
for you or your family,

255
00:35:27,081 --> 00:35:28,778
please just say the word.

256
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,565
There is something, actually.

257
00:35:32,608 --> 00:35:35,394
You two were the last ones
to see him, weren't you?

258
00:35:35,437 --> 00:35:38,353
Um...
I guess so.

259
00:35:38,397 --> 00:35:40,747
Um, that's what the police said.

260
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:43,837
Howard told me
that you were harassing him.

261
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,014
Playing elaborate pranks
of some sort.

262
00:35:47,057 --> 00:35:49,886
That you wouldn't
leave him alone.

263
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:51,714
I know he thought that.

264
00:35:51,758 --> 00:35:53,803
H-He told me, as well.

265
00:35:53,847 --> 00:35:57,242
Um, I think
he honestly believed it.

266
00:35:57,285 --> 00:35:59,853
But you're denying it.

267
00:36:03,291 --> 00:36:04,858
You know what?

268
00:36:04,901 --> 00:36:09,123
I didn't leave here
under the best, uh, terms.

269
00:36:10,255 --> 00:36:12,605
The past few years,
I could have, uh,

270
00:36:12,648 --> 00:36:14,302
been more considerate to Howard

271
00:36:14,346 --> 00:36:16,913
instead of yitzing him
every chance I got.

272
00:36:18,306 --> 00:36:21,135
I guess, uh...

273
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:24,617
there was a certain amount
of jealousy on my part

274
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:29,665
because Howard had the, uh,
respect of my brother.

275
00:36:31,754 --> 00:36:33,756
Which I never did.

276
00:36:36,368 --> 00:36:38,587
Tell me what you told
the police.

277
00:36:44,027 --> 00:36:48,380
Okay. Um well,
I mean, it was 11:00 P.M.

278
00:36:48,423 --> 00:36:51,687
Howard started
pounding on our door.

279
00:36:51,731 --> 00:36:55,691
He was very upset,
going on about something,

280
00:36:55,735 --> 00:36:58,520
uh, he thought was my fault.

281
00:36:58,564 --> 00:37:02,132
Uh, I guess it had to do
with the Sandpiper case,

282
00:37:02,176 --> 00:37:04,744
but I-I couldn't make
head or tail out of it.

283
00:37:04,787 --> 00:37:07,181
We tried to calm him down...

284
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:10,140
But he just... he just wouldn't.

285
00:37:10,184 --> 00:37:12,404
Um...

286
00:37:12,447 --> 00:37:15,102
Finally, he left.

287
00:37:15,145 --> 00:37:17,583
That... That's it.

288
00:37:17,626 --> 00:37:20,586
I'm not oblivious.

289
00:37:20,629 --> 00:37:23,502
I know people are saying
he was on drugs.

290
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:26,374
Is that what
you're trying to tell me?

291
00:37:27,854 --> 00:37:30,204
It just...

292
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,250
He just didn't
seem like himself.

293
00:37:32,293 --> 00:37:34,121
Are you hearing all of this?

294
00:37:34,164 --> 00:37:36,732
Because none of it
makes sense to me.

295
00:37:36,776 --> 00:37:38,101
Main: Cheryl,
maybe we should just...

296
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:39,525
I don't care
what people are saying.

297
00:37:39,561 --> 00:37:40,954
I don't care
what the police think.

298
00:37:40,997 --> 00:37:44,218
Howard was not on drugs.
That simply is not true.

299
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,916
There's something more to this.

300
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,745
I don't know if it's my place,

301
00:37:49,789 --> 00:37:51,312
but...

302
00:37:51,356 --> 00:37:52,705
I... I...

303
00:37:52,748 --> 00:37:55,751
Please... just spit it out.

304
00:38:03,716 --> 00:38:06,066
It was about
a year and a half ago.

305
00:38:06,109 --> 00:38:07,589
I was still an associate here.

306
00:38:07,633 --> 00:38:10,636
Working late on a brief.

307
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:13,726
And I saw a light on
in Howard's office.

308
00:38:13,769 --> 00:38:17,120
I assumed the cleaning crew
left it on by mistake.

309
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:21,864
And I was sure the office
was empty, so I didn't knock...

310
00:38:24,084 --> 00:38:25,607
And?

311
00:38:29,872 --> 00:38:32,832
And Howard was there
at his desk,

312
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:35,182
head down,

313
00:38:35,225 --> 00:38:37,315
and he was snorting something.

314
00:38:40,622 --> 00:38:43,103
I looked at him.
He looked at me.

315
00:38:44,452 --> 00:38:45,821
I didn't know what to do,
so I just walked out.

316
00:38:45,845 --> 00:38:47,344
And the next morning
when we saw each other,

317
00:38:47,368 --> 00:38:49,239
neither of us said
anything about it.

318
00:38:51,285 --> 00:38:53,896
I never told anyone...

319
00:38:55,637 --> 00:38:57,552
but now I wish I had.

320
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:07,388
In all the years
that you worked with him,

321
00:39:07,432 --> 00:39:10,086
have you witnessed
anything like this?

322
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:12,088
Even a hint?

323
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,528
Cliff?

324
00:39:16,571 --> 00:39:17,920
I...

325
00:39:20,227 --> 00:39:22,751
Cheryl, this really isn't
the time or the place.

326
00:39:31,238 --> 00:39:35,416
Cheryl, you were his wife.

327
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:39,899
You... You saw him every day,
you knew him better than anyone.

328
00:39:39,942 --> 00:39:43,468
Maybe I misunderstood
what I saw...

329
00:39:43,511 --> 00:39:46,688
You would have known.

330
00:39:46,732 --> 00:39:49,430
Please excuse me.

331
00:39:53,869 --> 00:39:56,219
Her sister's here somewhere.
I'm... I'm gonna go find her.

332
00:40:14,194 --> 00:40:18,851
I know that was tough,
um, but it's over now.

333
00:40:18,894 --> 00:40:20,505
I mean really over.

334
00:40:20,548 --> 00:40:22,463
Let the healing begin.

335
00:41:30,575 --> 00:41:32,272
Bailiff: All rise.

336
00:41:32,315 --> 00:41:33,665
Court is now in session.

337
00:41:33,708 --> 00:41:36,494
The Honorable Judge Dearden
presiding.

338
00:41:37,886 --> 00:41:39,497
Good afternoon.

339
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:47,156
We are here to discuss
a motion to exclude evidence

340
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,550
in State of New Mexico
v. Yarborough.

341
00:41:49,594 --> 00:41:51,334
Your Honor, if I may?

342
00:41:51,378 --> 00:41:52,858
I submitted
an additional motion.

343
00:41:52,901 --> 00:41:54,860
I'm assuming
you have not seen it yet.

344
00:41:56,296 --> 00:41:59,081
Did we get that? It just came in,
Judge.

345
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:01,170
I apologize.
It was a last minute addition.

346
00:42:01,214 --> 00:42:03,259
Last minute is right.

347
00:42:10,353 --> 00:42:12,225
Do I understand this correctly?

348
00:42:12,268 --> 00:42:14,706
You're requesting to withdraw
from this case?

349
00:42:14,749 --> 00:42:15,881
Yes, Your Honor.

350
00:42:15,924 --> 00:42:17,447
My client is fully informed

351
00:42:17,491 --> 00:42:19,121
and I've already been in touch
with another attorney.

352
00:42:19,145 --> 00:42:20,581
Paige Novick.

353
00:42:20,625 --> 00:42:23,410
She's highly qualified
and familiar with the case.

354
00:42:23,453 --> 00:42:25,412
She's prepared to step in,
if you'll allow it.

355
00:42:25,455 --> 00:42:30,286
Ms. Wexler, Mr. Orenstein,
approach the bench.

356
00:42:39,295 --> 00:42:42,951
Ms. Wexler, we are here today
at yourinsistence,

357
00:42:42,995 --> 00:42:45,475
to consider yourmotion,
to exclude evidence.

358
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:48,348
And this is the moment
you choose to withdraw?

359
00:42:48,391 --> 00:42:50,829
It was unavoidable.

360
00:42:50,872 --> 00:42:52,918
May I ask why?

361
00:42:52,961 --> 00:42:54,267
Personal reasons, Your Honor.

362
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:56,922
Personal reasons.

363
00:42:56,965 --> 00:42:59,011
Are we talking about
a health issue?

364
00:42:59,054 --> 00:43:00,882
Something to do with
a loved one?

365
00:43:00,926 --> 00:43:02,623
No.

366
00:43:02,667 --> 00:43:05,191
Would you rather discuss this
privately in chambers?

367
00:43:05,234 --> 00:43:07,454
Thank you
for the consideration...

368
00:43:07,497 --> 00:43:09,587
but no.

369
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:13,286
Would you care to supply
any detail at all?

370
00:43:13,329 --> 00:43:14,940
Your Honor, I'd prefer not to.

371
00:43:17,333 --> 00:43:18,857
Mr. Orenstein,

372
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:22,208
is the state prepared
to discuss Ms. Wexler's motion?

373
00:43:22,251 --> 00:43:25,037
We are, Your Honor.
Absolutely.

374
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,647
You know what,
Ms. Wexler?

375
00:43:26,691 --> 00:43:28,562
Mr. Orenstein is here.
I'm here.

376
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,346
We all showed up for your party

377
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:33,001
and now you're taking away
the punchbowl?

378
00:43:33,045 --> 00:43:37,092
I'm inclined to have you
argue your motion

379
00:43:37,136 --> 00:43:39,965
and then I'll consider
late-arriving petitions.

380
00:43:40,008 --> 00:43:42,010
I'm sorry for wasting
the court's time, Your Honor,

381
00:43:42,054 --> 00:43:45,100
but it's impossible for me
to continue with this hearing.

382
00:43:45,144 --> 00:43:47,581
And why is that,
Ms. Wexler?

383
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,627
Because I'm no longer
an attorney.

384
00:43:52,107 --> 00:43:53,326
I'm sorry? What?

385
00:43:54,501 --> 00:43:56,851
I gave notice to the bar
two hours ago.

386
00:44:55,649 --> 00:44:58,652
You did what?!
Why... why?!

387
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,219
All right, all right.
I know why.

388
00:45:00,262 --> 00:45:01,873
But, Kim,
you can't just... Jimmy, I-I...

389
00:45:01,916 --> 00:45:04,136
Shh. Just let me
say my piece, okay?

390
00:45:04,179 --> 00:45:06,747
Just...
Let's take a breath here.

391
00:45:06,791 --> 00:45:08,967
Kim, after everything
that happened...

392
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:11,926
I mean, Jesus.
I get it.

393
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:14,407
You want to climb
out of your own skin.

394
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:15,713
That's natural.

395
00:45:15,756 --> 00:45:18,759
But, Kim, you don't just
throw everything away.

396
00:45:18,803 --> 00:45:21,283
Th-This is your life.
You're a lawyer.

397
00:45:21,327 --> 00:45:23,808
Wh... uh, what about
your clients, huh?

398
00:45:23,851 --> 00:45:28,856
What about, uh, that poor guy,
uh, Mr. Yarborough?

399
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:31,293
What about the kid
in foster care?

400
00:45:31,337 --> 00:45:33,252
Huh? You give them
everything you've got.

401
00:45:33,295 --> 00:45:35,297
Who are they gonna find
who's half as good as you?

402
00:45:35,341 --> 00:45:37,038
No one!
They need you.

403
00:45:37,082 --> 00:45:39,649
It's already done. Ugh!

404
00:45:42,304 --> 00:45:44,524
Okay.
What's done can be undone.

405
00:45:44,567 --> 00:45:45,873
All I'm saying is
just... just...

406
00:45:45,917 --> 00:45:48,093
Let's take a week or two
to think it over.

407
00:45:48,136 --> 00:45:52,184
For now, we're gonna take
some time off.

408
00:45:52,227 --> 00:45:53,794
God knows we need it.

409
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:56,492
We're gonna find a new place.
We're gonna leave here.

410
00:45:56,536 --> 00:45:59,887
We're never, ever gonna
come back here again, okay?

411
00:45:59,931 --> 00:46:02,150
We're gonna...
We're gonna put it behind us.

412
00:46:02,194 --> 00:46:04,631
Things will look brighter.
I guarantee it.

413
00:46:04,674 --> 00:46:06,633
But first, we have to fix this.

414
00:46:06,676 --> 00:46:08,374
So we're gonna go back
to the hotel room,

415
00:46:08,417 --> 00:46:09,679
and you're gonna write letters.

416
00:46:09,723 --> 00:46:11,092
You're gonna write a letter
to the bar.

417
00:46:11,116 --> 00:46:12,658
You're gonna write letters
to your clients.

418
00:46:12,682 --> 00:46:14,206
Y-You... You dictate.
I will type.

419
00:46:14,249 --> 00:46:15,773
We're gonna roll
this thing back.

420
00:46:15,816 --> 00:46:17,644
I'll order a pizza.
We'll pull an all-nighter

421
00:46:17,687 --> 00:46:21,604
because we're in this
together, okay?

422
00:46:21,648 --> 00:46:23,432
So, I'm gonna go get
your... your printer

423
00:46:23,476 --> 00:46:25,565
and then we're gonna get
the hell out of here.

424
00:46:25,608 --> 00:46:28,220
Look, Jimmy... J-Jimmy...

425
00:46:42,103 --> 00:46:44,714
You asked
if you were bad for me.

426
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:47,543
Kim: That's not it.

427
00:46:50,285 --> 00:46:52,505
We are bad for each other.

428
00:46:56,030 --> 00:46:58,337
Kim.

429
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:00,252
Don't do this.

430
00:47:00,295 --> 00:47:02,820
Kim, please.

431
00:47:02,863 --> 00:47:04,560
Jimmy.

432
00:47:06,562 --> 00:47:09,000
I have had the time
of my life with you.

433
00:47:11,698 --> 00:47:13,918
But we are bad
for everyone around us.

434
00:47:13,961 --> 00:47:18,400
Other people suffer
because of us.

435
00:47:18,444 --> 00:47:20,881
Apart, we're okay,

436
00:47:20,925 --> 00:47:23,797
but together...

437
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:25,320
we're poison.

438
00:47:27,235 --> 00:47:28,367
No. No.

439
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:29,934
Just tell me

440
00:47:29,977 --> 00:47:31,674
what I need to do
to change, okay?

441
00:47:31,718 --> 00:47:34,199
Just tell me what it is
and I'll do it.

442
00:47:34,242 --> 00:47:36,375
Jimmy.
No, Kim.

443
00:47:36,418 --> 00:47:38,420
You make me happy.

444
00:47:38,464 --> 00:47:41,075
We make each other happy.

445
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:43,338
How can that be bad?

446
00:47:44,818 --> 00:47:47,821
Hey.

447
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,997
I love you.

448
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:55,263
I love you, too.

449
00:47:58,049 --> 00:47:59,528
But so what?

450
00:47:59,572 --> 00:48:02,140
No. No.

451
00:48:02,183 --> 00:48:03,358
No, Kim, you're wrong!

452
00:48:03,402 --> 00:48:06,013
This is about Howard!

453
00:48:06,057 --> 00:48:08,015
Okay? What happened to him
wasn't on us.

454
00:48:08,059 --> 00:48:10,757
It wasn't your fault.
It wasn't my fault!

455
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,064
It was that fucking
Lalo Salamanca!

456
00:48:13,107 --> 00:48:14,848
That psychopath came back
from the dead

457
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:16,284
and he walked through that door!

458
00:48:16,328 --> 00:48:19,200
He did this.
Not us. Him.

459
00:48:19,244 --> 00:48:20,593
I knew.

460
00:48:20,636 --> 00:48:22,290
You knew wh-what?

461
00:48:22,334 --> 00:48:23,596
I knew he was alive.

462
00:48:24,945 --> 00:48:26,816
No, you didn't.

463
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:29,167
It was about a month ago.

464
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:31,734
I saw that car
following me again.

465
00:48:31,778 --> 00:48:33,780
And it turned out
that Mike Ehrmantraut

466
00:48:33,823 --> 00:48:35,477
had guys watching both of us.

467
00:48:35,521 --> 00:48:38,567
Watching for Lalo.

468
00:48:40,004 --> 00:48:41,875
Mike... Mike told you

469
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:43,094
that Lalo was alive...

470
00:48:48,534 --> 00:48:50,492
and you didn't tell me?

471
00:48:59,153 --> 00:49:02,983
Jimmy, I thought...
I thought it was

472
00:49:03,027 --> 00:49:04,787
a one in a million chance
that he'd come for us.

473
00:49:04,811 --> 00:49:06,987
I thought he would be caught
if he did.

474
00:49:07,031 --> 00:49:09,511
And I told myself
I was protecting you.

475
00:49:11,078 --> 00:49:12,601
But that's not the truth.
The...

476
00:49:14,603 --> 00:49:16,562
The real reason
I didn't tell you

477
00:49:16,605 --> 00:49:19,173
was because
I knew what you'd do.

478
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:23,090
Wh... What would I do?

479
00:49:23,134 --> 00:49:25,875
You'd... You'd blame yourself.

480
00:49:25,919 --> 00:49:28,617
You'd fear for me.

481
00:49:28,661 --> 00:49:30,054
You'd want us to run and hide

482
00:49:30,097 --> 00:49:31,707
until you were sure I was safe.

483
00:49:31,751 --> 00:49:33,753
You would pull the plug
on the scam.

484
00:49:33,796 --> 00:49:35,450
And then...

485
00:49:39,715 --> 00:49:42,066
And then, uh...

486
00:49:42,109 --> 00:49:43,719
we'd break up.

487
00:49:47,593 --> 00:49:49,551
And I didn't want that.

488
00:49:55,122 --> 00:49:58,996
Because I was having
too much fun.

489
00:50:51,874 --> 00:50:54,094
Any way you want it,
that's the way you need it

490
00:50:54,138 --> 00:50:56,096
Any way you want it

491
00:50:59,665 --> 00:51:01,449
She loves to laugh

492
00:51:01,493 --> 00:51:03,103
She loves to sing

493
00:51:03,147 --> 00:51:06,585
She does everything

494
00:51:06,628 --> 00:51:08,282
She loves to move

495
00:51:08,326 --> 00:51:09,979
She loves to groove

496
00:51:13,983 --> 00:51:15,898
Rise and shine, time to go.

497
00:51:27,954 --> 00:51:31,479
Hit me.

498
00:51:31,523 --> 00:51:34,569
I'm hearing your report didn't
use the magic words, Doc.

499
00:51:34,613 --> 00:51:36,789
Soft. Tissue. Damage.

500
00:51:36,832 --> 00:51:39,096
Doesn't matter
what the X-rays show,

501
00:51:39,139 --> 00:51:41,446
tissue damage
gets my client paid...

502
00:51:41,489 --> 00:51:43,491
Hey, hey.
You're not listening.

503
00:51:43,535 --> 00:51:46,146
My client isn't
just suing your company,

504
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:50,324
he's coming after you
personally.

505
00:51:50,368 --> 00:51:53,414
Listen, you have a choice, okay?

506
00:51:53,458 --> 00:51:56,896
You can pay up now

507
00:51:56,939 --> 00:51:59,507
or, uh, bleed to death in court.

508
00:51:59,551 --> 00:52:03,685
So, I say be smart
and write that check.

509
00:52:03,729 --> 00:52:05,165
You have till E.O.D.

510
00:52:05,209 --> 00:52:07,385
I'm so sorry.
I'm getting another call.

511
00:52:09,169 --> 00:52:12,781
Got it.
What else you got?

512
00:52:12,825 --> 00:52:15,219
Oh, that's my Xanax guy.

513
00:52:15,262 --> 00:52:17,786
Uh, tell him yes and today...

514
00:52:20,528 --> 00:52:24,663
Another public masturbator?
Which one?

515
00:52:24,706 --> 00:52:26,578
A new guy? Huh.

516
00:52:26,621 --> 00:52:28,710
Everyone must be doing it...

517
00:52:31,278 --> 00:52:32,386
What do you mean,
he hasn't paid?

518
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:34,325
I saw him give you the card.

519
00:52:34,368 --> 00:52:37,371
A fake?
That sneaky little jackass.

520
00:52:37,415 --> 00:52:40,200
Tell him he'll be spending
St. Patrick's Day in Los Lunas

521
00:52:40,244 --> 00:52:42,289
unless he comes up
with the cash ASAP.

522
00:52:42,333 --> 00:52:45,031
Wait. Shut up. Shut up.
I got a good one.

523
00:52:45,074 --> 00:52:48,252
Did you see a bus went off I-40
up near Gates?

524
00:52:48,295 --> 00:52:49,731
Eighteen people injured.

525
00:52:50,819 --> 00:52:52,386
Uh, don't we know a kid,

526
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:54,867
an intern at the hospital
up there, had a bunch of DUls?

527
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:57,304
What was his name?

528
00:52:57,348 --> 00:52:59,306
Breakfast bar,
go ahead, take one.

529
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:01,482
I'm not...
I'm not talking to you.

530
00:53:01,526 --> 00:53:04,224
Uh, Ramirez. Ramirez.
Yes. Call that kid.

531
00:53:04,268 --> 00:53:06,618
Tell him I want the names
and numbers of all the victims.

532
00:53:06,661 --> 00:53:08,663
I smell class action.

533
00:53:08,707 --> 00:53:11,536
And then get the kid
with the camera.

534
00:53:11,579 --> 00:53:12,798
Send him up there.

535
00:53:12,841 --> 00:53:14,365
And then call the newspaper

536
00:53:14,408 --> 00:53:16,976
and say that Saul Goodman
is outraged

537
00:53:17,019 --> 00:53:20,284
at the
"Fiery Fiasco on the Forty."

538
00:53:20,327 --> 00:53:22,068
That's what we're gonna call it.

539
00:53:25,637 --> 00:53:28,553
Move it to court day.

540
00:53:28,596 --> 00:53:30,685
I'm... I'm not going down there
twice in one week.

541
00:53:30,729 --> 00:53:32,470
That's their problem...

542
00:53:32,513 --> 00:53:34,994
Send a messenger

543
00:53:35,037 --> 00:53:38,302
with, uh, Beanie Babies
and an Edible Arrangement

544
00:53:38,345 --> 00:53:39,999
with extra dipped pineapple.

545
00:53:40,042 --> 00:53:42,195
It's... Shut up. Shut up. Saul
on radio: Better Call Saul!

546
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:44,699
Auto insurance won't pay
for your fender bender?

547
00:53:44,743 --> 00:53:46,919
Ripped off
by your brother-in-law?

548
00:53:46,962 --> 00:53:49,574
Major or minor surgery
gone wrong?

549
00:53:49,617 --> 00:53:51,315
I'm here for you, Albuquerque.

550
00:53:51,358 --> 00:53:52,925
Better Call Saul!

551
00:53:52,968 --> 00:53:56,189
Call 505-503-4...

552
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:58,278
Did you hear that?
It's in mono.

553
00:53:58,322 --> 00:54:01,325
I'm not paying
for that muffled crap.

554
00:54:01,368 --> 00:54:03,327
Mono!
It's what The Beatles used.

555
00:54:03,370 --> 00:54:04,850
It's ancient.

556
00:54:04,893 --> 00:54:07,940
Look, I sound like I'm in a well

557
00:54:07,983 --> 00:54:09,724
inside of a cave
under a blanket.

558
00:54:09,768 --> 00:54:12,814
I'm... Who wants a lawyer
who you can't hear?

559
00:54:17,906 --> 00:54:18,994
Here's what you do.

560
00:54:19,038 --> 00:54:20,909
Stop the check ASAP,

561
00:54:20,953 --> 00:54:22,998
then call the station manager.

562
00:54:27,481 --> 00:54:29,788
You tell them if the ad
doesn't make my ears bleed

563
00:54:29,831 --> 00:54:32,747
the next time it plays,
I will see him in court.

564
00:54:34,183 --> 00:54:35,576
Screw the FCC!

565
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:38,405
I'll go to the mat
with those pencil-pushers.

566
00:54:38,449 --> 00:54:39,667
Ugh.

567
00:54:44,063 --> 00:54:47,327
This is textbook
freedom of speech.

568
00:54:47,371 --> 00:54:48,981
What could be more American
than that?

569
00:54:49,024 --> 00:54:51,636
I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy.

570
00:54:53,507 --> 00:54:55,857
Get all that? Call the bank.
Cancel the check.

571
00:54:55,901 --> 00:54:57,990
Call the station manager.
Tell him to crank it up

572
00:54:58,033 --> 00:55:00,471
or I'll see him
in court. Got it.

573
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:07,652
Move.

574
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,243
What?

575
00:55:34,287 --> 00:55:38,422
Alright. Let justice be done
though the heavens fall.

576
00:55:54,481 --> 00:55:56,527
And ready, set, action!

577
00:55:56,570 --> 00:55:58,572
Move, move, move!

578
00:55:58,616 --> 00:56:00,095
Go, go, go!

579
00:56:00,139 --> 00:56:02,663
One, Armani suits and run!

580
00:56:02,707 --> 00:56:04,665
Two, Air Jordan shoes for you!

581
00:56:04,709 --> 00:56:07,102
Three, linen shirts for free!

582
00:56:07,146 --> 00:56:09,844
Four, cashmere sweaters
out the door!

583
00:56:09,888 --> 00:56:13,065
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
