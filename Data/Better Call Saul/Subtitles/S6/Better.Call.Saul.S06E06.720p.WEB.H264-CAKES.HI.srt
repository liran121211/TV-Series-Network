00:09:56,987 --> 00:10:00,425
He got lunch for himself
and his receptionist

179
00:10:00,556 --> 00:10:01,644
at around 1:30.

180
00:10:01,775 --> 00:10:03,559
The Vietnamese place again.

181
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,517
Then, in the... What's this?

182
00:10:05,648 --> 00:10:07,519
Yeah, I was just
getting to that.

183
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:10,740
That was three days ago.
Only time he broke the pattern.

184
00:10:10,871 --> 00:10:12,699
Stopped at Cradock Marine
over on Central

185
00:10:12,829 --> 00:10:15,005
instead of going
straight to the office.

186
00:10:15,136 --> 00:10:17,878
Looked like he made
a cash withdrawal.

187
00:10:18,008 --> 00:10:19,488
I couldn't get a good angle
through the window,

188
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,883
but I counted four,
maybe five stacks?

189
00:10:23,013 --> 00:10:25,886
I'd say somewhere
in the ballpark of 20 grand.

190
00:10:27,888 --> 00:10:31,239
I'm not a lawyer,
but is there any reason

191
00:10:31,369 --> 00:10:34,285
he'd need that much cash in
the normal course of business?

192
00:10:37,158 --> 00:10:39,987
No legitimate reason.

193
00:10:45,253 --> 00:10:47,777
[Knock on door]

194
00:10:55,393 --> 00:10:57,657
[Lock disengages]

195
00:11:00,485 --> 00:11:02,923
Mr. Oliver: Thank you so much, Doc.
Of course. Of course. Come on in.

196
00:11:03,053 --> 00:11:04,402
We'll take a look.

197
00:11:04,533 --> 00:11:06,448
It's gonna be okay.

198
00:11:06,578 --> 00:11:08,624
Gonna be okay.

199
00:11:08,755 --> 00:11:10,539
[Keys jingling, lock engages]

200
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,281
Come on.

201
00:11:13,411 --> 00:11:15,936
[Dog whining]
Caldera: Okay.
Fernando's gonna be fine.

202
00:11:16,066 --> 00:11:18,155
The shot I gave him
will settle his stomach.

203
00:11:18,286 --> 00:11:20,201
But I want to keep him
for a few more minutes,

204
00:11:20,331 --> 00:11:22,159
make sure he doesn't have
any reactions.

205
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,509
After that, you're all set.
That's such a relief.

206
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,208
We were so worried.We're lucky
you were able to see us.

207
00:11:27,338 --> 00:11:28,557
Ah, it's no problem.

208
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:29,732
I was already here
with another patient.

209
00:11:29,863 --> 00:11:33,344
Alright.
Be back. [Smooches]

210
00:11:33,475 --> 00:11:35,303
[Door creaks lightly]

211
00:11:35,433 --> 00:11:37,914
[Dogs barking]

212
00:11:50,884 --> 00:11:53,234
Alright.
How are we doing?

213
00:11:53,364 --> 00:11:56,063
I dunno, um, I guess
my skin's a little dry

214
00:11:56,193 --> 00:11:59,980
where you put that stuff on,
but otherwise...

215
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,595
Are you sure
you used enough?

216
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:07,901
Absolutely.
[Sighs]

217
00:12:08,031 --> 00:12:09,946
Just give it
a little more time.

218
00:12:10,077 --> 00:12:11,992
Look all the way
to the right.

219
00:12:12,122 --> 00:12:14,908
Now to the left.

220
00:12:15,038 --> 00:12:16,823
What's it gonna
feel like?

221
00:12:16,953 --> 00:12:20,435
[Sighs] Depends on how
used to caffeine you are.

222
00:12:20,565 --> 00:12:24,178
I mean, you're not gonna be
trippin' balls, but...

223
00:12:24,308 --> 00:12:25,832
it's gonna feel like,
you know,

224
00:12:25,962 --> 00:12:28,573
two Red Bulls
on an empty stomach.

225
00:12:28,704 --> 00:12:30,706
And how long
is it gonna last?

226
00:12:30,837 --> 00:12:32,577
Is the guy
roughly your size?

227
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,754
Yeah.

228
00:12:34,884 --> 00:12:36,930
An hour or two.

229
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,802
And if there's
a blood test?

230
00:12:39,933 --> 00:12:41,935
This stuff is not showing up
on any blood panel

231
00:12:42,065 --> 00:12:43,675
they're running
in this town.

232
00:12:43,806 --> 00:12:45,982
You're gonna do this,
this is the way to go.

233
00:12:47,897 --> 00:12:49,681
Here.
[Chuckling] Whoa, whoa.

234
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:51,596
Promise me
this has been sterilized.

235
00:12:51,727 --> 00:12:53,903
It's brand new,

236
00:12:54,034 --> 00:12:57,080
and for you,
it goes under the armpit.

237
00:12:57,211 --> 00:12:58,255
[Chuckling] Okay.

238
00:12:58,386 --> 00:12:59,866
Sorry.

239
00:13:01,171 --> 00:13:06,046
[Sighs] I cannot wait to be done
with all of this.

240
00:13:06,176 --> 00:13:08,309
I hear ya.
You know, I read somewhere

241
00:13:08,439 --> 00:13:11,181
that vets are even more
depressed than lawyers.

242
00:13:11,312 --> 00:13:12,966
[Chuckles]
Depressed?

243
00:13:13,096 --> 00:13:14,663
No, no, no, no, no.

244
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,405
I love being a vet.

245
00:13:17,535 --> 00:13:19,320
Look over there.

246
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,235
See that?

247
00:13:21,365 --> 00:13:23,890
That's what
it's all about.

248
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,500
Animals are my life.

249
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:28,677
It's this other stuff
that's getting to be too much,

250
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,157
no offense.

251
00:13:32,507 --> 00:13:35,510
Anyway, a guy's gotta know
when he's bagged his limit.

252
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,078
What...
so you're closing up shop?

253
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,123
Yep. Leaving town.

254
00:13:40,254 --> 00:13:41,995
Once I sell
my little black book,

255
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,345
it's gonna be all animals,
all the time.

256
00:13:44,475 --> 00:13:46,086
Black book?

257
00:13:46,216 --> 00:13:48,088
Yeah, the keys
to the kingdom.

258
00:13:48,218 --> 00:13:51,308
You know, you call me up,
you're looking for a someone?

259
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:54,224
[Taps book]
Keep all my "someones" in here.

260
00:13:54,355 --> 00:13:56,705
Can I see it?

261
00:14:01,797 --> 00:14:04,104
Knock yourself out.

262
00:14:04,234 --> 00:14:07,542
[Chuckles] Oh.

263
00:14:07,672 --> 00:14:09,587
Alright, yeah.
I think we, uh...

264
00:14:09,718 --> 00:14:11,894
we found
the Zodiac Killer.

265
00:14:12,025 --> 00:14:17,813
Well...I'm not keeping my
contacts in plain English.

266
00:14:17,944 --> 00:14:20,555
"Best Quality Vacuum"?

267
00:14:20,685 --> 00:14:24,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

268
00:14:24,951 --> 00:14:27,344
Alright.
Let's give it another 10.

269
00:14:27,475 --> 00:14:29,303
I'll be back.

270
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:32,088
[Sighs]

271
00:14:32,219 --> 00:14:34,264
What a waste.

272
00:14:34,395 --> 00:14:36,397
You think?

273
00:14:36,527 --> 00:14:39,139
[Scoffs] Did you see how many
people he had in that book?

274
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:42,707
I mean, he's raking it in,
day in, day out.

275
00:14:42,838 --> 00:14:45,580
It's passive income.
Minimal risk.

276
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:48,322
I can't believe
he's walking away from that.

277
00:14:48,452 --> 00:14:51,368
Well...

278
00:14:51,499 --> 00:14:55,503
he knows
what he wants.

279
00:14:55,633 --> 00:14:57,374
Anything?

280
00:14:57,505 --> 00:15:01,726
[Sighs] Not really.

281
00:15:01,857 --> 00:15:03,598
[Chuckling]
Oh, my God.

282
00:15:03,728 --> 00:15:05,208
What?
Uh...

283
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:06,949
[Chuckles]

284
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:14,391
Whoa.
[Breathes sharply]

285
00:15:19,222 --> 00:15:22,312
Judge Metcalf: Hold on. Hold on.
Let's just cut to the chase.

286
00:15:22,443 --> 00:15:25,402
Your client... who has, let's
call it a "checkered" past,

287
00:15:25,533 --> 00:15:28,275
was pulled over for a clear
violation of traffic laws

288
00:15:28,405 --> 00:15:32,235
and found in possession of
a felony quantity of marijuana.

289
00:15:32,366 --> 00:15:34,977
And now you're asking me
to throw out this evidence?

290
00:15:35,108 --> 00:15:37,023
In words of one syllable,

291
00:15:37,153 --> 00:15:40,330
how does this pass
the smell test?

292
00:15:40,461 --> 00:15:43,333
Kim:
Your Honor [clears throat]

293
00:15:43,464 --> 00:15:46,554
this is what
this is all about.

294
00:15:46,684 --> 00:15:48,556
According to
Officer Connell's report,

295
00:15:48,686 --> 00:15:51,254
this is the reason
Joshua Holcome was pulled over.

296
00:15:51,385 --> 00:15:54,692
New Mexico statue 66-3-846.

297
00:15:54,823 --> 00:15:57,217
Driving with
an obstructed window.

298
00:15:57,347 --> 00:15:59,784
This morning,
I did an informal survey

299
00:15:59,915 --> 00:16:01,308
of the courthouse parking lot.

300
00:16:01,438 --> 00:16:03,875
And by my count,
over a third of the vehicles

301
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:07,488
had something similar hanging
from their rear-view mirrors.

302
00:16:07,618 --> 00:16:11,231
I believe your car
was one of them, Your Honor.

303
00:16:11,361 --> 00:16:15,887
So [sighs] unless you
and 47 of our colleagues

304
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:18,412
have outstanding tickets,
I'd argue that this statute

305
00:16:18,542 --> 00:16:21,110
is not...
regularly enforced.

306
00:16:21,241 --> 00:16:23,895
Your Honor, this was
a perfectly reasonable,

307
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:25,723
routine stop for cause.

308
00:16:25,854 --> 00:16:27,203
Uh, what's the point here?

309
00:16:27,334 --> 00:16:29,901
The point is
that this was not routine.

310
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:31,381
Officer Connell
knew my client.

311
00:16:31,512 --> 00:16:33,470
In fact,
he arrested him five years ago

312
00:16:33,601 --> 00:16:35,168
when Joshua was a juvenile.

313
00:16:35,298 --> 00:16:36,691
And Officer Connell's
record shows

314
00:16:36,821 --> 00:16:38,475
that this is only
the third citation

315
00:16:38,606 --> 00:16:41,435
he's written for this statute
in almost 20 years.

316
00:16:41,565 --> 00:16:44,873
So either this is
an incredible coincidence

317
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,658
or Officer Connell
recognized my client

318
00:16:47,789 --> 00:16:49,312
and used the dangler
as a pretext

319
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:51,749
to violate
his Fourth Amendment rights.

320
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,274
Your Honor, all I'm asking
is that you take another look

321
00:16:54,404 --> 00:16:55,710
at the officer's statement.

322
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,234
Ask yourself
if the state's version of events

323
00:16:58,365 --> 00:17:00,410
passes the "smell test."

324
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:03,109
[Whirring]

325
00:17:04,545 --> 00:17:06,938
[Clanking]

326
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,201
Main:
That was nicely argued.

327
00:17:08,331 --> 00:17:10,072
Thanks. We'll see
what the judge does.

328
00:17:10,203 --> 00:17:12,118
[Chuckles]
[Clears throat]

329
00:17:12,248 --> 00:17:14,511
Defense like that takes time
to pull together, doesn't it?

330
00:17:14,642 --> 00:17:16,296
Whaddya think it took...
30 hours?

331
00:17:16,426 --> 00:17:19,212
Oh, probably
more like 50.

332
00:17:19,342 --> 00:17:21,692
50 hours. Huh.

333
00:17:21,823 --> 00:17:23,694
And the contracts office...
they pay...?

334
00:17:23,825 --> 00:17:25,914
$700 a case. Flat.

335
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,743
So you're making minimum wage,
more or less.

336
00:17:32,007 --> 00:17:34,227
Whew.

337
00:17:34,357 --> 00:17:36,751
I've been meaning to ask,
if you don't mind...

338
00:17:36,881 --> 00:17:39,319
how did you leave things
with Howard Hamlin?

339
00:17:39,449 --> 00:17:42,191
[Indistinct conversations in distance]

340
00:17:42,322 --> 00:17:45,238
I wouldn't be here today
if it wasn't for Howard.

341
00:17:46,587 --> 00:17:49,851
I wouldn't be an attorney.
I wouldn't have met my husband.

342
00:17:51,505 --> 00:17:56,205
I owe Howard and HHM a lot.

343
00:18:03,604 --> 00:18:06,563
Have you heard of
the Jackson Mercer Foundation?

344
00:18:07,825 --> 00:18:09,175
Of course.

345
00:18:09,305 --> 00:18:11,351
They fund justice reform
programs on the East Coast.

346
00:18:11,481 --> 00:18:13,353
I wish we had something
like that out here.

347
00:18:13,483 --> 00:18:18,227
Well, it's a bit hush-hush
at the moment, but we will soon.

348
00:18:18,358 --> 00:18:20,795
And that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

349
00:18:22,492 --> 00:18:24,929
[Footsteps approaching]

350
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,802
