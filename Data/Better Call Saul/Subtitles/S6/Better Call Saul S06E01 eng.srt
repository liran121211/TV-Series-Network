1
00:05:40,037 --> 00:05:42,081
Inside. In the kitchen.

2
00:07:20,555 --> 00:07:21,765
Yeah.

3
00:07:21,765 --> 00:07:23,725
<i>Where are you?</i>

4
00:07:23,725 --> 00:07:25,518
I don't know.

5
00:07:25,518 --> 00:07:27,645
I've only been...

6
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:31,399
...been heading north
for about two hours.

7
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:33,693
I crossed a river
maybe an hour ago.

8
00:07:33,693 --> 00:07:35,319
<i>Anybody see you?</i>

9
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:36,654
No.

10
00:07:36,654 --> 00:07:38,072
<i>Keep it that way.</i>

11
00:07:38,072 --> 00:07:39,699
<i>You're in Salamanca territory.</i>

12
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:41,951
<i>Everybody's gonna be
on the lookout for you.</i>

13
00:07:41,951 --> 00:07:43,244
<i>And I mean everybody.</i>

14
00:07:43,244 --> 00:07:45,538
<i>That includes the</i> Federales.

15
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,460
Is it done?

16
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,169
<i>Yeah. He's dead.</i>

17
00:07:58,635 --> 00:08:00,762
There were some...

18
00:08:00,762 --> 00:08:02,263
regular people...

19
00:08:03,222 --> 00:08:05,015
at that house, some old folks.

20
00:08:06,392 --> 00:08:07,602
What about them?

21
00:08:07,602 --> 00:08:09,854
<i>Got no information on that.</i>

22
00:08:09,854 --> 00:08:11,230
<i>When we hang up,</i>

23
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,065
<i>take the battery
out of your phone.</i>

24
00:08:13,065 --> 00:08:14,317
<i>Head north.</i>

25
00:08:14,317 --> 00:08:15,819
<i>Stay out of sight.</i>

26
00:08:15,819 --> 00:08:17,821
<i>I'm fixing up a place for you
to lie low.</i>

27
00:08:17,821 --> 00:08:20,030
<i>In an hour,
you put the battery back in</i>

28
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:22,492
<i>and I'll call you
and tell you where to go.</i>

29
00:09:00,655 --> 00:09:02,156
Don Eduardo.

30
00:09:02,156 --> 00:09:03,783
Are you all right?

31
00:09:03,783 --> 00:09:06,995
An accident.
Sorry to trouble you.

32
00:09:06,995 --> 00:09:08,245
May I come in?

33
00:09:08,245 --> 00:09:09,330
Of course!

34
00:09:09,831 --> 00:09:11,415
Gracias.

35
00:09:14,168 --> 00:09:16,044
Sugar, milk?

36
00:09:17,046 --> 00:09:18,840
No need. Thank you.

37
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:36,858
Delicious!

38
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,028
What's wrong?

39
00:09:40,028 --> 00:09:42,864
Don Eduardo is here!

40
00:09:42,864 --> 00:09:44,114
Don Eduardo...

41
00:09:44,114 --> 00:09:46,325
So good to see you!

42
00:09:46,325 --> 00:09:47,911
I'd shake your hand, but...

43
00:09:47,911 --> 00:09:51,205
Look at you! Mountain man!

44
00:09:51,205 --> 00:09:53,374
You look like ZZ Top!

45
00:09:53,917 --> 00:09:55,585
ZZ--?

46
00:09:55,585 --> 00:09:58,046
Clean up for Don Eduardo!
Go wash, shave!

47
00:09:58,046 --> 00:09:59,547
Oh sure!

48
00:09:59,547 --> 00:10:01,758
I'm sorry, Don Eduardo.

49
00:10:01,758 --> 00:10:02,675
Go!

50
00:10:02,675 --> 00:10:04,552
Excuse me.

51
00:10:05,511 --> 00:10:07,304
Hey, Mateo.

52
00:10:07,304 --> 00:10:10,266
Keep the mustache and
the soul patch. It looks good.

53
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:13,185
Yes, Don Eduardo.

54
00:10:15,063 --> 00:10:17,815
You're sure
you don't want breakfast?

55
00:10:17,815 --> 00:10:19,943
The eggs are fresh from
this morning.

56
00:10:21,903 --> 00:10:24,781
How are Mateo's teeth doing?
Better?

57
00:10:24,781 --> 00:10:27,992
Yes! Your dentist
worked so hard!

58
00:10:27,992 --> 00:10:32,705
Matti used to be up all night
with the pain.

59
00:10:32,705 --> 00:10:37,961
Now he sleeps like a baby.
Thanks to you, Don Eduardo.

60
00:10:37,961 --> 00:10:39,629
That's good, Sylvia.

61
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:41,338
And the goats?

62
00:10:41,338 --> 00:10:44,133
From your hometown?
They don't miss the mountains?

63
00:10:44,133 --> 00:10:45,301
They're fine.

64
00:10:45,301 --> 00:10:47,929
We're expecting
two more next month.

65
00:10:47,929 --> 00:10:49,597
You sent for more?

66
00:10:50,974 --> 00:10:53,017
Cabritos. Babies.

67
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:55,019
Mm.

68
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:58,439
You're almost finished.
I'll make more.

69
00:10:58,439 --> 00:11:01,025
You're sure about breakfast?

70
00:11:01,025 --> 00:11:02,526
Just coffee is fine.

71
00:11:44,568 --> 00:11:45,987
It's all right?

72
00:11:47,989 --> 00:11:49,323
Very handsome.

73
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:39,874
Hey.

74
00:12:42,126 --> 00:12:44,587
So, uh, what's on
the agenda?

75
00:12:44,587 --> 00:12:48,799
Uh, well, I just got
20 new clients from Grant, so--

76
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:50,634
Twenty?
Yeah.

77
00:12:50,634 --> 00:12:53,096
I have meetings with four
of them this afternoon,

78
00:12:53,096 --> 00:12:55,765
and a preliminary hearing
with Flaherty first thing.

79
00:12:55,765 --> 00:12:57,058
Juvenile.

80
00:12:57,058 --> 00:12:58,350
What about you?

81
00:12:59,393 --> 00:13:00,770
Mm.

82
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:02,312
Same thing.

83
00:13:02,312 --> 00:13:03,773
Huge day.

84
00:13:06,109 --> 00:13:08,444
Yes, your mother
and your grandmother.

85
00:13:08,444 --> 00:13:11,572
If they can take time off
from work, both of them.

86
00:13:11,572 --> 00:13:14,742
Do you have any uncles or--?

87
00:13:15,701 --> 00:13:17,285
Oh, yeah. That would be great.

88
00:13:18,662 --> 00:13:20,497
Do you have anything nice
to wear?

89
00:13:22,499 --> 00:13:24,668
Like a sports coat, or...

90
00:13:25,628 --> 00:13:27,421
a collared shirt?
Hey.

91
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:30,758
You know what?
I'll bring something for you.

92
00:13:30,758 --> 00:13:32,176
That's too nice.

93
00:13:32,176 --> 00:13:34,178
No, it's no problem.

94
00:13:35,054 --> 00:13:36,430
You know how
to get there?

95
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,558
Tijeras and Fifth.
That's right. Yes.

96
00:13:39,558 --> 00:13:42,145
All right, I will meet you
at 9:30 sharp.

97
00:13:42,145 --> 00:13:43,687
It's gonna be fine, Ronnie.

98
00:13:44,939 --> 00:13:47,399
Well, tell them
it's gonna be fine.

99
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:48,859
Because it will be.

100
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,070
Okay.

101
00:13:53,864 --> 00:13:55,323
Thanks.

102
00:13:55,323 --> 00:13:56,784
I'll bring it back clean.

103
00:13:58,661 --> 00:14:02,039
Shoot. Do you have any cash
for the taxi?

104
00:14:07,211 --> 00:14:09,964
Crap, all's I got
is 5 bucks.

105
00:14:13,467 --> 00:14:14,802
Um...

106
00:14:32,862 --> 00:14:34,905
Think the cabbie
will break a hundred?

107
00:18:26,262 --> 00:18:27,888
Good morning, Don Juan.

108
00:18:27,888 --> 00:18:29,890
Lalo Salamanca is dead.

109
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:32,435
Gunmen broke into his hacienda
last night.

110
00:18:32,435 --> 00:18:35,062
<i>Hired operators
from the look of it.</i>

111
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,857
It was messy. Very messy.

112
00:18:38,857 --> 00:18:40,276
<i>As for the Salamancas...</i>

113
00:18:40,276 --> 00:18:42,403
<i>"Sangre por sangre."</i>

114
00:18:42,403 --> 00:18:45,531
Yes. That is the Salamanca way.

115
00:18:45,531 --> 00:18:47,866
We are on the verge of chaos.

116
00:18:48,742 --> 00:18:50,202
But who did this?

117
00:18:50,202 --> 00:18:52,204
<i>One minute,
I hear talk of the Colombians.</i>

118
00:18:52,204 --> 00:18:54,290
<i>The next, traitors.</i>

119
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:56,125
<i>Traitors close to home.</i>

120
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:57,585
<i>We know this much.</i>

121
00:18:57,585 --> 00:18:59,128
Ignacio Varga is a rat.

122
00:18:59,128 --> 00:19:01,171
Don Eladio has put a price
on his head.

123
00:19:01,171 --> 00:19:03,299
Every man we have
is searching for him.

124
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:05,008
When Varga's found,

125
00:19:05,008 --> 00:19:07,677
we'll know who he was
working for.

126
00:19:09,138 --> 00:19:11,848
I assume Don Hector
has been told.

127
00:19:11,848 --> 00:19:13,350
<i>I called him myself.</i>

128
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:16,270
<i>As for if he understood me,</i>
quién sabe.

129
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:18,397
Listen to me.

130
00:19:18,397 --> 00:19:20,608
You must be careful, Gustavo.

131
00:19:20,608 --> 00:19:22,276
This is a dangerous time.

132
00:19:22,276 --> 00:19:25,195
<i>No one is above suspicion.</i>

133
00:19:25,195 --> 00:19:26,655
I understand.

134
00:19:26,655 --> 00:19:27,990
<i>Good.</i>

135
00:19:55,476 --> 00:19:59,647
Tell me again about the <i>sicario</i>
who made the final report.

136
00:19:59,647 --> 00:20:02,191
He was already wounded
when he talked to our cut-out.

137
00:20:02,191 --> 00:20:04,485
<i>Federales</i> found him dead
at the scene.

138
00:20:04,485 --> 00:20:06,278
But they got Salamanca.

139
00:20:06,278 --> 00:20:09,490
The mercenaries are dead

140
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:10,782
to a man.

141
00:20:10,782 --> 00:20:13,577
And yet, their mission
was a success.

142
00:20:16,372 --> 00:20:19,082
It has been known
to happen.

143
00:20:19,082 --> 00:20:21,335
I could go down there
and get Varga,

144
00:20:21,335 --> 00:20:23,546
bring him home safe.

145
00:20:23,546 --> 00:20:25,881
There's ways to do it
on the quiet.

146
00:20:33,763 --> 00:20:36,850
Unless you already
have something in the works.

147
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:55,160
Speak your mind.

148
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,080
Loyalty goes both ways.

149
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,790
Varga's done everything
you asked him.

150
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,668
He wasn't given
a choice.

151
00:21:02,668 --> 00:21:05,546
Maybe so, but he played
a tough game.

152
00:21:05,546 --> 00:21:07,506
And he played it
on the square.

153
00:21:09,383 --> 00:21:10,676
And?

154
00:21:10,676 --> 00:21:13,053
When all is said and done,

155
00:21:13,053 --> 00:21:16,056
the kid deserves your respect.

156
00:21:18,601 --> 00:21:19,935
He has it.

157
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:24,147
Is there more
you wish to say?

158
00:21:53,469 --> 00:21:56,513
I hope this brings your guy
more luck than it brought me.

159
00:21:59,266 --> 00:22:00,517
You good?

160
00:22:00,517 --> 00:22:02,478
I'm great.

161
00:22:25,459 --> 00:22:27,043
Detective. Miss Khalil.

162
00:22:27,961 --> 00:22:29,254
Good morning.

163
00:22:29,254 --> 00:22:30,964
I've been calling you
for two days.

164
00:22:30,964 --> 00:22:32,924
Well, my girl's out sick.

165
00:22:32,924 --> 00:22:34,301
What can I do you for?

166
00:22:34,301 --> 00:22:35,927
Tomorrow morning,
10 a.m.

167
00:22:35,927 --> 00:22:38,472
Brunch? But just you and me,
right?

168
00:22:38,472 --> 00:22:41,308
I mean, won't the big fella here
feel like a third wheel?

169
00:22:41,308 --> 00:22:44,186
You and I are meeting
Parson in chambers.

170
00:22:44,186 --> 00:22:46,229
I am asking for
an emergency hearing

171
00:22:46,229 --> 00:22:48,649
to alter the terms
of De Guzman's release.

172
00:22:48,649 --> 00:22:50,192
That sounds like a blast.

173
00:22:50,192 --> 00:22:52,528
Unfortunately,
I'm booked solid.

174
00:22:52,528 --> 00:22:54,988
I checked your client's
place of residence.

175
00:22:54,988 --> 00:22:56,239
The address he gave?

176
00:22:56,239 --> 00:22:58,074
It's a Dairy Queen
in Alta Monte.

177
00:22:58,074 --> 00:23:00,285
The family that showed
at the bail hearing

178
00:23:00,285 --> 00:23:01,537
can't be located.

179
00:23:01,537 --> 00:23:02,870
No driver's license,

180
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:05,165
no tax rolls,
no school records, nothing.

181
00:23:05,165 --> 00:23:07,959
Fact is, there isn't a single
Elizabeth McKinnon

182
00:23:07,959 --> 00:23:11,630
under the age of 73
living in New Mexico.

183
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:14,717
Well, this is--
This is surprising.

184
00:23:14,717 --> 00:23:16,301
Your client
has disappeared,

185
00:23:16,301 --> 00:23:18,679
and I'm not waiting six weeks
to start looking for him.

186
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:21,097
Hey, my guy put up
7 million in bail.

187
00:23:21,097 --> 00:23:23,350
You think he's just
gonna walk away from that?

188
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:25,561
Who comes up with 7 million
bucks in cash?

189
00:23:25,561 --> 00:23:27,062
You know
what I think?

190
00:23:27,062 --> 00:23:29,189
I think
the family was fake,

191
00:23:29,189 --> 00:23:31,107
and I think you knew it
the whole time.

192
00:23:31,107 --> 00:23:33,694
Hold up, let's just
get real for a second here.

193
00:23:33,694 --> 00:23:35,195
The hearing didn't go
your way,

194
00:23:35,195 --> 00:23:36,739
and now you're trying
for a do-over.

195
00:23:36,739 --> 00:23:38,240
You say my guy ran?

196
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,743
I say, he's got 7 million
reasons for showing up

197
00:23:40,743 --> 00:23:43,161
when he's legally required
to do so.

198
00:23:43,161 --> 00:23:48,083
So, no, I won't be due process
window dressing

199
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:50,043
at any crash meeting
with Parson.

200
00:23:50,043 --> 00:23:52,462
And if you try throwing
any of this crap around

201
00:23:52,462 --> 00:23:54,590
in front of the judge
without my presence,

202
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:56,049
here's an accusation:

203
00:23:56,049 --> 00:23:57,551
prosecutorial misconduct.

204
00:23:57,551 --> 00:24:00,387
Career-ending
prosecutorial misconduct.

205
00:24:00,387 --> 00:24:02,305
None of that changes the fact...

206
00:24:02,305 --> 00:24:04,808
...the guy's not who he said.
No, no, no. Hold on.

207
00:24:04,808 --> 00:24:06,976
You guys got caught with
your pants around your ankles,

208
00:24:06,976 --> 00:24:08,311
and somehow that's on me?

209
00:24:08,311 --> 00:24:09,605
I don't think so.

210
00:24:09,605 --> 00:24:11,231
You've got two dozen lawyers
up there.

211
00:24:11,231 --> 00:24:12,482
You got investigators,

212
00:24:12,482 --> 00:24:14,234
you got the whole damn
police force,

213
00:24:14,234 --> 00:24:16,111
and it's my fault
you can't keep track of Lalo?

214
00:24:16,111 --> 00:24:17,404
That is not my job!

215
00:24:17,404 --> 00:24:19,823
Lalo? Who's Lalo?

216
00:24:20,657 --> 00:24:22,325
What? What did I say?

217
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,994
I meant, De Guzman.

218
00:24:24,994 --> 00:24:26,663
I have more than one client.

219
00:24:26,663 --> 00:24:28,582
So, ahem...

220
00:24:28,582 --> 00:24:31,543
I will see you
at the preliminary in six weeks

221
00:24:31,543 --> 00:24:33,670
as scheduled.

222
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:36,465
Until then, I have
clients who need me.

223
00:25:29,476 --> 00:25:31,102
Nice threads.

224
00:25:31,102 --> 00:25:33,146
Uh, thanks.

225
00:25:38,193 --> 00:25:39,569
Hey.
Hi.

226
00:25:40,487 --> 00:25:41,655
How'd it go?

227
00:25:41,655 --> 00:25:44,992
The suit
definitely helped.

228
00:25:44,992 --> 00:25:46,785
This kid,

229
00:25:46,785 --> 00:25:48,662
he's a high school senior.

230
00:25:49,746 --> 00:25:51,832
Good grades,
works two jobs,

231
00:25:51,832 --> 00:25:54,960
has this so-called...
friend,

232
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,461
some snot-nosed brat

233
00:25:56,461 --> 00:25:58,588
who drives a brand-new
Mustang convertible.

234
00:25:58,588 --> 00:26:00,423
One Saturday night,
Richie Rich says,

235
00:26:00,423 --> 00:26:01,967
"Hey, you wanna drive
my car?"

236
00:26:01,967 --> 00:26:03,552
How can my guy resist?

237
00:26:03,552 --> 00:26:05,846
The friend tells him
to pull over at a liquor store.

238
00:26:05,846 --> 00:26:07,639
Rich kid goes in,

239
00:26:07,639 --> 00:26:09,391
robs the place with
his uncle's bowie knife.

240
00:26:09,391 --> 00:26:11,018
No.
Yeah.

241
00:26:11,018 --> 00:26:13,228
My guy's out in the Mustang,
playing with the radio.

242
00:26:13,228 --> 00:26:14,521
He's got no idea.

243
00:26:14,521 --> 00:26:17,399
Rich kid comes out
with 425 in cash,

244
00:26:17,399 --> 00:26:19,484
bottle of Jägermeister,
tells my guy to floor it,

245
00:26:19,484 --> 00:26:21,110
which he does, happily,

246
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:23,405
because he's completely
in the dark about the robbery.

247
00:26:23,405 --> 00:26:26,033
Yeah, but when they pick him up,
your kid is driving.

248
00:26:26,033 --> 00:26:28,577
He's driving, yes.
Of course he's driving.

249
00:26:28,577 --> 00:26:30,579
My guy ends up
with a public defender.

250
00:26:30,579 --> 00:26:33,874
Rich kid's family brings in
a top-dollar defense

251
00:26:33,874 --> 00:26:36,710
from out of state,
if you can believe it, Denver,

252
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:39,588
and they're trying to dump
the whole thing on my guy.

253
00:26:39,588 --> 00:26:41,256
It was my client's idea,

254
00:26:41,256 --> 00:26:44,259
he was forcing the rich kid
into it, the whole deal.

255
00:26:44,259 --> 00:26:46,386
Oakley's going for aggravated
robbery and assault.

256
00:26:46,386 --> 00:26:48,095
Oakley? That dick. Yeah.

257
00:26:48,095 --> 00:26:50,640
But your kid was never even
inside the store.

258
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,851
Flaherty forced joinder,
but I--

259
00:26:54,101 --> 00:26:55,812
I think I can
make it work for us.

260
00:26:55,812 --> 00:26:57,230
Trial's next month.

261
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:58,982
This was really good.
Have some.

262
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,484
You want anything?
Uh...

263
00:27:01,484 --> 00:27:03,070
You should definitely
try these.

264
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,738
Excuse me?
Sure.

265
00:27:04,738 --> 00:27:07,240
Can we get a menu and another
order of sopaipillas?

266
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,784
You got it.
Thank you.

267
00:27:09,826 --> 00:27:11,536
And there was
a homeless woman

268
00:27:11,536 --> 00:27:13,538
that I had to get
out of MDC.

269
00:27:14,539 --> 00:27:16,291
That's another story.

270
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:19,002
Sounds like the day from hell.

271
00:27:20,253 --> 00:27:22,005
It was one of the best days
of my life.

272
00:27:24,674 --> 00:27:25,926
My professional life.

273
00:27:28,177 --> 00:27:29,512
How about you?

274
00:27:31,306 --> 00:27:33,600
I rented us a car.

275
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,935
It's-- It's the Ford.

276
00:27:36,311 --> 00:27:40,857
So Saul Goodman drives
a brown Ford Taurus?

277
00:27:40,857 --> 00:27:44,486
Detroit calls that taupe,
I believe.

278
00:27:44,486 --> 00:27:46,571
Don't you think Saul Goodman
would drive something

279
00:27:46,571 --> 00:27:49,449
with a little more...flair?

280
00:27:49,449 --> 00:27:51,034
Such as?

281
00:27:51,034 --> 00:27:52,535
I don't know.

282
00:27:52,535 --> 00:27:54,579
Definitely American-made.

283
00:27:54,579 --> 00:27:56,247
Something showy.

284
00:27:57,290 --> 00:28:01,670
And Saul Goodman
has an office.

285
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:03,755
Something eye-catching.

286
00:28:03,755 --> 00:28:05,007
Good location.

287
00:28:05,007 --> 00:28:06,842
By the courthouse?
Yeah.

288
00:28:07,843 --> 00:28:09,218
A cathedral of justice.

289
00:28:09,218 --> 00:28:12,179
Oh! A cathedral of justice.

290
00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:13,640
Okay. Yeah.

291
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,893
We should start looking
for something for you.

292
00:28:16,893 --> 00:28:18,645
I mean for "Saul."

293
00:28:18,645 --> 00:28:20,647
Sold. When do we start?

294
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:22,983
Saturday's good.

295
00:28:22,983 --> 00:28:24,609
Saturday it is.

296
00:28:33,409 --> 00:28:35,495
I was thinking
about our first move.

297
00:28:36,746 --> 00:28:38,206
On the Howard front.

298
00:28:40,375 --> 00:28:43,086
I think there's a way
to get Sandpiper settled

299
00:28:43,086 --> 00:28:44,713
and leave him standing.

300
00:28:44,713 --> 00:28:47,090
Bruised, maybe,
but still standing.

301
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:48,675
Maybe the trick is,

302
00:28:48,675 --> 00:28:51,469
we're not working on Howard,
not at first.

303
00:28:51,469 --> 00:28:54,097
Maybe we start
with Cliff Main.

304
00:28:55,015 --> 00:28:56,349
So, uh...

305
00:28:57,684 --> 00:28:59,144
we're doing that?

306
00:29:00,937 --> 00:29:02,689
I thought we were.
Aren't we?

307
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,734
You think we shouldn't.

308
00:29:07,527 --> 00:29:10,279
Well, I-- I didn't say that. Um...

309
00:29:12,699 --> 00:29:14,576
Here we are.

310
00:29:16,078 --> 00:29:18,621
Did you decide on anything?
No, not yet.

311
00:29:18,621 --> 00:29:21,374
Can I get you a drink
while you're thinking about it?

312
00:29:21,374 --> 00:29:24,002
Uh, yeah. A Coke. Thanks.

313
00:29:36,556 --> 00:29:38,975
All right.
Here you go.

314
00:29:38,975 --> 00:29:40,393
Okay.

315
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:49,611
So the, uh...

316
00:29:50,987 --> 00:29:52,488
...the Howard thing.

317
00:29:54,032 --> 00:29:55,742
Wh-- What were you thinking?

318
00:29:59,704 --> 00:30:00,997
You sure?

319
00:30:03,458 --> 00:30:05,252
What's the harm
in listening?

320
00:30:08,046 --> 00:30:09,338
Well, heh...

321
00:30:10,632 --> 00:30:12,425
it has to be paced right.

322
00:30:13,802 --> 00:30:15,887
We move too fast,
they'll see us coming.

323
00:30:17,097 --> 00:30:19,141
And it has to make sense.

324
00:30:19,141 --> 00:30:21,017
It doesn't have to stand up
in court,

325
00:30:21,017 --> 00:30:23,853
but there has to be a reason
for everything.

326
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:17,712
<i>Yeah.</i>
I'm at the motel.

327
00:34:17,712 --> 00:34:19,547
No one saw me
but the lady who runs it.

328
00:34:19,547 --> 00:34:21,757
<i>All right. We're working
on getting you out.</i>

329
00:34:21,757 --> 00:34:23,426
<i>It's gonna take
a couple of days.</i>

330
00:34:23,426 --> 00:34:25,303
<i>I'll call you when our guys
are set up.</i>

331
00:34:25,303 --> 00:34:27,222
<i>They're gonna be driving
a farm truck.</i>

332
00:34:27,222 --> 00:34:29,098
<i>When they pass,
you jump in the back.</i>

333
00:34:29,098 --> 00:34:31,476
<i>It's gonna happen fast.
They're not gonna wait for you.</i>

334
00:34:31,476 --> 00:34:33,353
<i>There's some clothes
in the closet.</i>

335
00:34:33,353 --> 00:34:34,729
<i>Wear them.</i>

336
00:34:36,356 --> 00:34:38,483
What happens
between now and then?

337
00:34:38,483 --> 00:34:40,651
<i>Stay out of sight.</i>

338
00:34:40,651 --> 00:34:42,945
<i>Eladio put a price
on your head.</i>

339
00:34:42,945 --> 00:34:45,990
<i>Anyone comes through
that door, you shoot.</i>

340
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:47,367
<i>You got it?</i>

341
00:34:50,286 --> 00:34:51,620
Yeah.

342
00:35:45,174 --> 00:35:46,468
Here you go.

343
00:35:47,385 --> 00:35:48,595
Thanks.

344
00:35:48,595 --> 00:35:50,346
No, you see,
you build it too high,

345
00:35:50,346 --> 00:35:52,723
your marble's gonna run
off the track.

346
00:35:52,723 --> 00:35:54,267
It's not finished.

347
00:35:54,267 --> 00:35:56,936
When it's finished,
it'll work.

348
00:35:56,936 --> 00:35:58,271
Okay.

349
00:35:59,647 --> 00:36:01,232
May I please have
some more lemonade?

350
00:36:01,232 --> 00:36:04,319
No. You drank
about a gallon already.

351
00:36:04,319 --> 00:36:06,488
Please, Pop-pop.

352
00:36:08,573 --> 00:36:10,825
All right,
one more and that's it.

353
00:36:10,825 --> 00:36:12,868
Thank you, Pop-pop.

354
00:36:54,785 --> 00:36:56,371
Three...

355
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,832
Four...

356
00:37:01,125 --> 00:37:02,751
Five...

357
00:37:04,462 --> 00:37:05,880
Six...

358
00:37:16,015 --> 00:37:17,433
Oh, wait.

359
00:37:19,018 --> 00:37:21,020
There they are.

360
00:37:24,065 --> 00:37:25,858
Oh, yeah.

361
00:37:25,858 --> 00:37:29,696
Okay,
they're on the fourth hole.

362
00:37:29,696 --> 00:37:32,739
Assuming they're playing nine,
that should give you about...

363
00:37:32,739 --> 00:37:34,992
45 minutes, safely.

364
00:37:37,078 --> 00:37:38,663
You gotta teach me
to play golf.

365
00:37:38,663 --> 00:37:40,956
A lawyer should be able
to play golf.

366
00:37:40,956 --> 00:37:43,167
Any time.

367
00:37:49,173 --> 00:37:50,466
You all right?

368
00:37:51,676 --> 00:37:53,177
Yup.

369
00:37:53,177 --> 00:37:54,512
Piece of cake.

370
00:38:27,545 --> 00:38:29,004
Excuse me, sir.

371
00:38:29,004 --> 00:38:31,840
Are you a member
or a guest?

372
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,926
I'm just here for a tour.

373
00:38:33,926 --> 00:38:35,136
Oh, welcome.

374
00:38:35,136 --> 00:38:36,971
Front desk
is straight ahead.

375
00:38:39,641 --> 00:38:41,309
Hi, I called about a tour?

376
00:38:41,309 --> 00:38:44,395
Oh, if you'll follow me
to the members' lounge?

377
00:38:51,611 --> 00:38:53,321
<i>Hi. Norm Wakely.</i>

378
00:38:53,321 --> 00:38:55,364
I understand you're
in the market for a tour?

379
00:38:55,364 --> 00:38:56,949
That's right.
Saul Goodman.

380
00:38:56,949 --> 00:38:58,534
Great to meet you,
Mr. Goodman.

381
00:38:58,534 --> 00:39:00,578
Oh, please, call me Saul. Great.

382
00:39:00,578 --> 00:39:03,790
So, Saul, can I get you
anything before we get started?

383
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:05,874
The coffee here
is just unbeatable.

384
00:39:05,874 --> 00:39:07,251
Uh, well, I'm fine.

385
00:39:07,251 --> 00:39:09,128
I'm fully caffeinated.

386
00:39:09,128 --> 00:39:14,133
Well, Saul, you and I
are standing on hallowed ground.

387
00:39:14,133 --> 00:39:16,844
Five presidents have played
on our course...

388
00:39:16,844 --> 00:39:19,138
Oh, really?
...starting with Eisenhower.

389
00:39:19,138 --> 00:39:22,057
But the story goes back
even further than that--

390
00:39:22,057 --> 00:39:24,185
Norm! Can I have a sec, please?

391
00:39:24,185 --> 00:39:26,479
Kevin, hey,
how's it going?

392
00:39:26,479 --> 00:39:27,855
Uh, I'm sorry.

393
00:39:27,855 --> 00:39:29,774
I'm sure this will just
be a moment.

394
00:39:43,329 --> 00:39:44,831
Mr. Goodman...

395
00:39:44,831 --> 00:39:46,374
I'm so sorry,

396
00:39:46,374 --> 00:39:49,502
but I've just been reminded
that, in fact,

397
00:39:49,502 --> 00:39:51,170
we have a two-year
waiting list.

398
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:53,088
Two years. Wow.

399
00:39:54,799 --> 00:39:58,093
Maybe I could, uh,
go on the tour anyway,

400
00:39:58,093 --> 00:39:59,303
I mean, because I'm here.

401
00:39:59,303 --> 00:40:00,722
Just in case.

402
00:40:00,722 --> 00:40:03,057
Well, unfortunately,
we suspended tours.

403
00:40:03,057 --> 00:40:04,266
For the moment.

404
00:40:04,266 --> 00:40:05,893
You're not even
giving tours?

405
00:40:05,893 --> 00:40:08,020
I apologize
for the inconvenience.

406
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:10,939
We'll be happy to call you
if the situation changes.

407
00:40:10,939 --> 00:40:13,150
You left your number?
Uh-huh.

408
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,652
Well, we'll be in touch...

409
00:40:14,652 --> 00:40:17,112
if the situation changes.

410
00:40:17,112 --> 00:40:20,115
Again, I-- I'm sorry
for your time and trouble.

411
00:40:20,115 --> 00:40:23,536
Uh, we just--
We had a few crossed wires.

412
00:40:24,787 --> 00:40:26,121
Well...

413
00:40:27,206 --> 00:40:28,541
Okay, then.

414
00:40:29,542 --> 00:40:30,835
Thank you.

415
00:40:41,596 --> 00:40:43,180
I'm sorry.
Oh, yes?

416
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:46,058
Just so I understand,
you were gonna give me a tour,

417
00:40:46,058 --> 00:40:48,519
and then you realized
you don't need new members?

418
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:49,896
We have a waiting list.

419
00:40:49,896 --> 00:40:51,606
Okay, but you're
the membership director,

420
00:40:51,606 --> 00:40:53,023
so you would have
known that before.

421
00:40:53,023 --> 00:40:55,025
I know.
It doesn't really add up.

422
00:40:55,025 --> 00:40:58,112
I mean, I came in and everyone
was rolling out the red carpet,

423
00:40:58,112 --> 00:41:00,322
and then, all of a sudden,
something changed.

424
00:41:00,322 --> 00:41:01,574
I don't...

425
00:41:01,574 --> 00:41:03,242
Mr. Goodman, I--
Goodman.

426
00:41:03,242 --> 00:41:05,035
The name.
The second you heard it,

427
00:41:05,035 --> 00:41:06,788
everything turned
on a dime!

428
00:41:06,788 --> 00:41:08,163
Wow.

429
00:41:08,163 --> 00:41:09,749
Waiting list.

430
00:41:09,749 --> 00:41:12,042
I think you're talking
about an exclusion list.

431
00:41:12,042 --> 00:41:15,421
It's okay. I should've known,
because, I mean, look,

432
00:41:15,421 --> 00:41:17,465
it's wall-to-wall mayonnaise
in here!

433
00:41:17,465 --> 00:41:20,134
So, you know, listen,
if you're gonna be restricted,

434
00:41:20,134 --> 00:41:21,594
have the courage
to say so.

435
00:41:21,594 --> 00:41:23,512
There's no question of--
Here it is, folks!

436
00:41:23,512 --> 00:41:26,682
Anti-Semitism alive and well,
right here in Albuquerque.

437
00:41:26,682 --> 00:41:29,226
Sir, we have many
Jewish members.

438
00:41:29,226 --> 00:41:31,061
Oh, good, well,
you've met your quota, then.

439
00:41:31,061 --> 00:41:32,354
Gold star for you.

440
00:41:32,354 --> 00:41:33,898
Hold on!

441
00:41:33,898 --> 00:41:36,525
That's gotta be the biggest
load of horse crap

442
00:41:36,525 --> 00:41:38,319
I've ever heard in my life.

443
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:41,196
Go crawl back in your hole,
McGill, or Goodman,

444
00:41:41,196 --> 00:41:42,782
whatever you're calling yourself.

445
00:41:42,782 --> 00:41:45,075
What are you up to,
anyway?

446
00:41:45,075 --> 00:41:47,787
Ginning up another one
of your put-up job lawsuits,

447
00:41:47,787 --> 00:41:49,455
you two-faced,
blackmailing,

448
00:41:49,455 --> 00:41:51,165
money-grubbing
son of a bitch--

449
00:41:51,165 --> 00:41:54,084
"Money-grubbing"? You're saying
the quiet part out loud.

450
00:41:54,084 --> 00:41:55,461
Gentlemen, can we just keep
the volume down?

451
00:41:55,461 --> 00:41:57,004
You know that's not
what I meant.

452
00:41:57,004 --> 00:41:58,339
In this day and age,

453
00:41:58,339 --> 00:42:00,090
I'd hoped and prayed
we'd be beyond this.

454
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:02,259
You're about as Jewish
as my Aunt Fannie--

455
00:42:02,259 --> 00:42:05,805
Five thousand years
and it never ends.

456
00:42:05,805 --> 00:42:08,390
Here it is. Violence!
It always comes to this!

457
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:10,017
Mr. Wachtell, please.

458
00:42:10,017 --> 00:42:11,352
Come on, Kev.

459
00:42:11,352 --> 00:42:13,688
You go to hell,
you lying sack of shit.

460
00:42:16,774 --> 00:42:18,150
Sir...

461
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:20,528
Mr. Goodman,
I don't know what to say.

462
00:42:20,528 --> 00:42:22,738
That is not--
I wouldn't be a member here.

463
00:42:22,738 --> 00:42:25,407
I wouldn't walk through
those doors again

464
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:27,576
after what happened to me
here today.

465
00:42:32,456 --> 00:42:33,791
Do you...

466
00:42:33,791 --> 00:42:37,003
at least have a bathroom
that I could use?

467
00:42:37,003 --> 00:42:38,462
Seeing as how my...

468
00:42:40,339 --> 00:42:43,634
Stress like that is hell
on my diverticulitis.

469
00:42:43,634 --> 00:42:45,135
The men's locker room
is the closest.

470
00:42:45,135 --> 00:42:46,512
It's straight through there.

471
00:42:46,512 --> 00:42:48,263
And I would be allowed
to go in there?

472
00:42:48,263 --> 00:42:49,724
Yes. Of course.

473
00:42:51,141 --> 00:42:53,519
I want you to know
I don't blame you personally.

474
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:55,771
I know you were just
following orders.

475
00:42:55,771 --> 00:42:58,315
It's okay, folks!
I'm leaving.

476
00:42:58,315 --> 00:42:59,775
All is well.

477
00:43:10,953 --> 00:43:12,538
Good morning, sir. Morning.

478
00:44:10,387 --> 00:44:13,099
Shit, shit, shit, shit!

479
00:44:21,523 --> 00:44:24,652
I swear it's nothing I did,
but one of your toilets is--

480
00:44:24,652 --> 00:44:26,236
I'll take care of it, sir.

481
00:44:26,236 --> 00:44:28,739
Okay. It's the middle one.
You can't miss it.

482
00:44:28,739 --> 00:44:30,407
Yeah. No--
No problem, sir.

483
00:44:58,727 --> 00:45:00,479
Two-two-seven.

484
00:45:01,689 --> 00:45:03,273
Two-two-seven.

485
00:45:25,087 --> 00:45:26,881
Went better than last time.

486
00:45:26,881 --> 00:45:28,883
Well, keep your head down,
you'll get better.

487
00:45:28,883 --> 00:45:31,552
Anyway, on the topic
of your hiring binge--

488
00:45:31,552 --> 00:45:32,720
Hardly a "binge."

489
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,013
What would you
call it?

490
00:45:34,013 --> 00:45:36,431
I'd call it
"prudent expansion."

491
00:45:36,431 --> 00:45:38,642
We're not headhunting
any of your associates,

492
00:45:38,642 --> 00:45:40,477
if that's what
you're worried about.

493
00:45:40,477 --> 00:45:42,270
Need a towel?
Sure.

494
00:45:46,901 --> 00:45:48,485
Hey.

495
00:45:50,445 --> 00:45:52,114
Listen, on the QT,

496
00:45:52,114 --> 00:45:54,783
I'd be particularly careful
with any lateral hires.

497
00:45:54,783 --> 00:45:56,869
You're talking
about what's-his-name,

498
00:45:56,869 --> 00:45:58,079
the guy from Tennessee?

499
00:45:58,079 --> 00:45:59,245
You hear something?

500
00:45:59,245 --> 00:46:00,664
Nothing I'd care
to repeat.

501
00:46:00,664 --> 00:46:02,416
Just "trust, but verify."

502
00:46:02,416 --> 00:46:03,751
Fair enough.

503
00:46:05,086 --> 00:46:07,253
Howard.
What?

504
00:46:16,847 --> 00:46:18,766
This can't be.

505
00:46:18,766 --> 00:46:20,017
Sure looks like it.

506
00:46:20,017 --> 00:46:22,310
Really?

507
00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:25,271
Not the first time I've seen
one of those, unfortunately.

508
00:46:25,271 --> 00:46:26,899
Where did it come from?

509
00:46:28,316 --> 00:46:30,318
Didn't it just fall out
of your locker?

510
00:46:31,445 --> 00:46:32,780
I don't see how.

511
00:46:34,615 --> 00:46:37,118
You don't think one of
the members could have--?

512
00:46:38,827 --> 00:46:40,370
Maybe somebody on staff.

513
00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:41,663
Oh.

514
00:47:02,226 --> 00:47:03,518
Where were you?

515
00:47:03,518 --> 00:47:05,604
I'll tell you later.
Here they come.

516
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,942
Did they find it?

517
00:47:09,942 --> 00:47:12,236
Yes.

518
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:15,697
What if they figure out
it's baby powder?

519
00:47:17,074 --> 00:47:18,450
They won't.

520
00:47:25,166 --> 00:47:27,793
I think maybe
we outsmarted ourselves.

521
00:47:29,878 --> 00:47:33,257
Maybe this was all
too subtle.

522
00:47:34,382 --> 00:47:36,635
Nope. Not too subtle.

523
00:47:37,928 --> 00:47:39,387
Perfect.

524
00:48:09,751 --> 00:48:11,795
<i>Andale.</i> Chop chop.

525
00:48:11,795 --> 00:48:13,505
We don't got all day, folks.

526
00:49:20,114 --> 00:49:21,573
When do we leave?

527
00:49:21,573 --> 00:49:23,617
We go when we go.

528
00:49:27,288 --> 00:49:29,706
I'm gonna need a minute.

529
00:49:29,706 --> 00:49:31,499
Nobody's waiting for you,
big stuff.

530
00:49:31,499 --> 00:49:34,128
What? Be nice.

531
00:49:59,861 --> 00:50:01,696
<i>Hello, Casa Tranquila.</i>

532
00:50:01,696 --> 00:50:03,282
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

533
00:50:03,282 --> 00:50:04,908
<i>Let me get someone
who speaks Spanish.</i>

534
00:50:04,908 --> 00:50:06,534
Oh, no, no. No problem.

535
00:50:06,534 --> 00:50:08,578
I would just like to speak
to one of your residents,

536
00:50:08,578 --> 00:50:09,913
if I may.

537
00:50:19,965 --> 00:50:22,717
Hector, are you awake?

538
00:50:22,717 --> 00:50:24,345
You have another
telephone call.

539
00:50:26,138 --> 00:50:30,184
LALO,
<i>Uncle? Can you hear me?</i>

540
00:50:31,101 --> 00:50:33,812
Do you know my voice?

541
00:50:35,189 --> 00:50:37,483
They told you about the attack,
didn't they?

542
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:41,111
<i>Let them keep believing
I'm dead.</i>

543
00:50:41,111 --> 00:50:42,446
<i>So much the better.</i>

544
00:50:43,447 --> 00:50:45,157
<i>It was the chicken man.</i>

545
00:50:46,367 --> 00:50:51,163
<i>That coward sat up there
in the north</i>

546
00:50:51,163 --> 00:50:53,874
while his paramilitaries
came into my home--

547
00:50:53,874 --> 00:50:55,792
My home, Uncle!

548
00:50:56,668 --> 00:50:59,171
Screw Bolsa, screw Eladio.

549
00:50:59,171 --> 00:51:00,672
I'm coming north.

550
00:51:00,672 --> 00:51:03,384
I'm going to hurt him.
Hurt him like you taught me.

551
00:51:03,384 --> 00:51:06,053
And then I will kill him.

552
00:51:06,053 --> 00:51:08,847
<i>What is it?</i>
Hector?

553
00:51:08,847 --> 00:51:11,933
Excuse me. I'm so sorry,
but Hector seems a little upset.

554
00:51:11,933 --> 00:51:14,395
Yeah, sorry, um... I'm just--

555
00:51:14,395 --> 00:51:17,231
I'm sharing a bit
of family news.

556
00:51:17,231 --> 00:51:18,690
Some good, some bad.

557
00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:20,442
Would you mind
putting him back on?

558
00:51:20,442 --> 00:51:21,567
It'll only be a minute.

559
00:51:21,567 --> 00:51:23,070
<i>Of course.</i>

560
00:51:24,696 --> 00:51:26,114
<i>Uncle?</i>

561
00:51:27,991 --> 00:51:30,869
<i>What is it?
Do you have another idea?</i>

562
00:51:34,039 --> 00:51:35,499
<i>Okay. Let's see.</i>

563
00:51:36,791 --> 00:51:40,421
A, B, C, D,

564
00:51:40,421 --> 00:51:43,507
E, F, G, H,

565
00:51:43,507 --> 00:51:47,094
I, J, K, L,

566
00:51:47,094 --> 00:51:50,556
<i>M, N, Ñ, O, P--</i>

567
00:51:51,723 --> 00:51:53,725
P? That's right?

568
00:51:53,725 --> 00:51:56,061
Okay.

569
00:51:56,061 --> 00:51:57,145
What's next?

570
00:51:58,105 --> 00:52:00,606
A, B, C...

571
00:52:04,652 --> 00:52:07,781
L, M, N...

572
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:13,579
U?

573
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:16,331
<i>Prueba?</i>

574
00:52:16,331 --> 00:52:17,916
Is that what you're saying?
Proof?

575
00:52:23,046 --> 00:52:25,591
Uncle, I don't have any proof.

576
00:52:25,591 --> 00:52:27,926
<i>For months, I was in the north
watching him,</i>

577
00:52:27,926 --> 00:52:28,885
<i>following his men.</i>

578
00:52:28,885 --> 00:52:30,011
<i>There was nothing.</i>

579
00:52:38,353 --> 00:52:39,396
Wait...

580
00:52:41,647 --> 00:52:42,983
There is proof.

581
00:52:45,693 --> 00:52:47,279
<i>I know where to find it.</i>

582
00:52:48,905 --> 00:52:52,033
Goodbye, Uncle.
You will see me soon.

583
00:52:59,416 --> 00:53:01,042
I changed my mind.

584
00:53:01,042 --> 00:53:02,377
I'm not going.

585
00:53:03,587 --> 00:53:04,879
And?

586
00:53:06,465 --> 00:53:08,175
And you give me back
my money.

587
00:53:12,179 --> 00:53:14,306
There's no refunds, asshole.

588
00:53:15,432 --> 00:53:16,766
I told you...

589
00:53:18,268 --> 00:53:19,769
be nice.

590
00:53:44,628 --> 00:53:46,338
Amigos...

591
00:53:46,338 --> 00:53:48,507
I'm very sorry,
but you're going to

592
00:53:48,507 --> 00:53:50,884
have to find
another way to the north.

593
00:53:51,759 --> 00:53:53,554
<i>Abuela...</i>

594
00:53:53,554 --> 00:53:56,306
Make sure everyone
gets their money back.

595
00:53:59,809 --> 00:54:01,520
Be careful.
