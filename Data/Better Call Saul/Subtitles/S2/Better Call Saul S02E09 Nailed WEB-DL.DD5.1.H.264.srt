1
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,342
Okay. All set.

2
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,015
Thank you for your patience.

3
00:04:52,017 --> 00:04:55,352
Didn't you say that the hearing
is more or less a formality?

4
00:04:55,354 --> 00:04:57,888
Well, the real work's
already been done, yes.

5
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:01,224
In that case,
I'm fine covering it myself.

6
00:05:01,226 --> 00:05:03,793
Kevin and Paige
don't need both of us there.

7
00:05:03,795 --> 00:05:04,694
That may be strictly true,

8
00:05:04,696 --> 00:05:08,632
but we want to send the right
message, don't we?

9
00:05:08,634 --> 00:05:10,667
I'm just worried
about your comfort.

10
00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:13,236
I find victory laps
very comforting.

11
00:06:21,073 --> 00:06:23,306
Well done, my friend.

12
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,913
Good morning.

13
00:06:29,915 --> 00:06:30,513
This meeting

14
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:33,717
of the New Mexico State Banking
Board is now in session.

15
00:06:33,719 --> 00:06:37,153
We have Mesa Verde
here with us today,

16
00:06:37,155 --> 00:06:40,257
and they're represented
by Charles McGill.

17
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:43,260
Nice to have you back, Charles.

18
00:06:43,262 --> 00:06:44,928
Thank you. Good to be back.

19
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,864
I'm here with my colleague,
Howard Hamlin.

20
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:51,034
And may I introduce
Mr. Kevin Wachtell,

21
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:53,903
president and chairman
of Mesa Verde Holdings,

22
00:06:53,905 --> 00:06:57,641
and Ms. Paige Novick,
Mesa Verde's senior counsel.

23
00:06:57,643 --> 00:06:58,842
Hello and welcome.

24
00:06:58,844 --> 00:07:00,777
I believe staff
has found the application

25
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:03,980
to meet the basic
requirements for approval.

26
00:07:03,982 --> 00:07:04,648
That's right, isn't it?

27
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:07,317
With your permission,
Mr. Wachtell would like to make

28
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:10,854
a brief statement
in support of the application.

29
00:07:13,992 --> 00:07:17,327
Mr. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen
of the New Mexico Banking Board,

30
00:07:17,329 --> 00:07:21,598
I'm honored and grateful to
appear before you this morning.

31
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,733
We believe that our
proposed expansion

32
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,568
is in the public interest,

33
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,904
both for Arizona and our own state.

34
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:31,374
For 46 years, the men and women
of Mesa Verde Bank and Trust

35
00:07:31,376 --> 00:07:34,577
have prided ourselves
on personal service

36
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,280
and attention to detail,
second to none.

37
00:07:37,282 --> 00:07:42,986
Mesa Verde continues to operate at
a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 11.2%.

38
00:07:42,988 --> 00:07:44,154
- Uh... Hold on.
- And we feel...

39
00:07:44,156 --> 00:07:47,257
Excuse me, Mr. Wachtell.
Just one moment.

40
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:49,092
Sir, sorry...

41
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:54,364
- What's going on?
- Well, let's find out.

42
00:07:54,366 --> 00:07:58,301
Uh, Mr. Commissioner,
is there something we can clarify?

43
00:07:58,303 --> 00:08:03,139
Um, yes. Can you give us the address of
the proposed Scottsdale branch again?

44
00:08:03,141 --> 00:08:09,679
Certainly. It's 1216 Rosella Drive,
Scottsdale, Arizona, 85262.

45
00:08:09,681 --> 00:08:10,046
1216?

46
00:08:10,048 --> 00:08:13,049
Okay. Because the application
I'm looking at today

47
00:08:13,051 --> 00:08:16,186
clearly gives the address as 1216.

48
00:08:16,188 --> 00:08:17,554
1216. That's correct, sir.

49
00:08:17,556 --> 00:08:20,490
But, in the original submission,

50
00:08:20,492 --> 00:08:23,493
we're seeing, "1261 Rosella Drive."

51
00:08:23,495 --> 00:08:25,562
- It is 1261.
- 1261.

52
00:08:25,564 --> 00:08:27,364
I think, if you double check,

53
00:08:27,366 --> 00:08:29,733
you'll see that 1216 is correct.

54
00:08:29,735 --> 00:08:31,901
There seem to be two
different addresses here.

55
00:08:31,903 --> 00:08:34,437
Mr. Commissioner, I have a
copy of our notice of intent,

56
00:08:34,439 --> 00:08:38,074
which was published in newspapers
in Arizona and New Mexico.

57
00:08:38,076 --> 00:08:40,009
It clearly states the address is 1261...

58
00:08:40,011 --> 00:08:42,545
- Rosella Drive.
- Mr. Commissioner. It...it...

59
00:08:42,547 --> 00:08:45,081
1261 Rosella Drive.

60
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:48,418
Yes, I have a copy of the
notice of intent, too.

61
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:54,224
But on the actual filing,
the address reads 1216.

62
00:08:54,226 --> 00:08:56,593
So, which is it?

63
00:08:56,828 --> 00:09:00,497
Mr. Commissioner,
if I may confer with my clients?

64
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:01,664
Certainly. Please.

65
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:05,068
It's absolutely 1261.

66
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,169
You are mistaken.

67
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:09,005
And with all due respect,
you are muddying the waters here.

68
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,775
Muddying the waters?

69
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,978
Look. Just look.

70
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,714
Well, this is clearly an error.

71
00:09:17,716 --> 00:09:20,316
It's 1261.
I know where my own damn bank is.

72
00:09:20,318 --> 00:09:23,286
Now, let's just all calm down.
I'm sure we can straighten this out.

73
00:09:23,288 --> 00:09:26,289
I've got a building remodel
at 1261 Rosella.

74
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,458
I don't know where the hell 1216 is.

75
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:31,694
I... I don't quite understand.

76
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,329
- 1261?
- 1261.

77
00:09:33,331 --> 00:09:37,167
- Is this gonna be a problem?
- No, I'm sure it won't be.

78
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:38,134
Um...

79
00:09:38,136 --> 00:09:39,736
Mr. Commissioner, I apologize.

80
00:09:39,738 --> 00:09:45,542
Unaccountably, there appears to
be a discrepancy in our filing.

81
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:46,543
So, the correct address

82
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:49,179
is the one that appeared
in the notice of intent?

83
00:09:49,181 --> 00:09:50,146
The 1261?

84
00:09:50,148 --> 00:09:50,847
It would seem so.

85
00:09:50,849 --> 00:09:54,184
We'd like to request a, um...

86
00:09:54,186 --> 00:09:55,452
An adjournment of just a few minutes,

87
00:09:55,454 --> 00:10:00,757
so that we can amend the filing
to reflect the correct address.

88
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:01,257
Well, I, uh...

89
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:04,828
I can give you an adjournment, uh...

90
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,930
Uh, but, uh...

91
00:10:06,932 --> 00:10:10,834
I don't think we can
get you back in today.

92
00:10:10,836 --> 00:10:11,334
If I may,

93
00:10:11,336 --> 00:10:14,204
when do you think you might
be able to schedule us?

94
00:10:14,206 --> 00:10:14,938
I'm being told by staff

95
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:20,009
that they've already done the
research for 1216 Rosella Drive.

96
00:10:20,011 --> 00:10:22,545
Our folks are going to have to
go back to square one...

97
00:10:22,547 --> 00:10:25,048
- ...on the new address.
- If we could obtain

98
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,950
a provisional agreement today...

99
00:10:26,952 --> 00:10:29,118
- to...to allow the branch to open...
- No, no.

100
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,621
With all due respect,
it's up to you folks

101
00:10:31,623 --> 00:10:34,023
to submit accurate paperwork.

102
00:10:34,025 --> 00:10:36,226
Maybe next time double check.

103
00:10:36,228 --> 00:10:40,797
Now, uh, the soonest we
could revisit this matter...

104
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:45,435
Well, it looks like
six weeks from Friday.

105
00:10:46,171 --> 00:10:47,437
We...

106
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:48,605
We can't wait six weeks.

107
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:54,110
Mr. Commissioner, Mesa Verde
has put effort and resources

108
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:57,247
into preparing this branch
to open immediately.

109
00:10:57,249 --> 00:10:57,914
However unusual,

110
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:03,619
a provisional approval would be
most appreciated, most welcome.

111
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,088
- Time being of the essence...
- Charles, I'm sorry.

112
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:09,292
I'll see you in six weeks.
That closes the matter for today.

113
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:13,496
Will staff please note that Mesa
Verde will return in six weeks.

114
00:11:13,498 --> 00:11:16,900
At which time, we will
revisit this application.

115
00:11:16,902 --> 00:11:19,102
That's understood well now?

116
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,740
This is not possible.

117
00:11:23,742 --> 00:11:26,175
This is not possible!

118
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,758
"1261."

119
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,027
No. No.

120
00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:45,595
Chuck?

121
00:11:46,064 --> 00:11:48,331
I don't understand.

122
00:11:48,633 --> 00:11:51,901
I don't understand.
It was 1216. It was.

123
00:11:51,903 --> 00:11:54,103
I checked. I double checked!

124
00:11:54,105 --> 00:11:54,837
Chuck, it happened.

125
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,674
Now we take our licks
and move on.

126
00:11:57,676 --> 00:11:58,841
This doesn't just reflect on you.

127
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:02,445
An office full of associates
and paralegals let this get by.

128
00:12:02,447 --> 00:12:03,913
I did too, for that matter.

129
00:12:03,915 --> 00:12:07,617
It was 1216. I promise you!

130
00:12:09,621 --> 00:12:12,155
Everyone makes mistakes.

131
00:12:27,138 --> 00:12:29,439
This was no mistake.

132
00:13:55,994 --> 00:13:58,895
I'm buying a round for the house.

133
00:14:00,231 --> 00:14:01,597
Yeah?

134
00:14:01,599 --> 00:14:03,066
Yeah.

135
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:07,136
Hey! Hey, listen up, everybody!

136
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:10,139
This gentleman's buying
a round for the house!

137
00:14:16,414 --> 00:14:17,980
All right, lift with your knees.

138
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,583
What does that even mean?
"Lift with your knees?"

139
00:14:20,585 --> 00:14:23,453
I don't know. It's something
sweaty people say. Here we go.

140
00:14:23,455 --> 00:14:25,421
One, two, three.

141
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,525
Got it.

142
00:14:29,527 --> 00:14:31,294
- Almost, almost, almost.
- Got it.

143
00:14:31,296 --> 00:14:34,497
All right. Right there. Go. Go.

144
00:14:38,937 --> 00:14:40,036
You okay?

145
00:14:40,038 --> 00:14:43,139
Nothing a few years
of physical therapy won't fix.

146
00:14:43,141 --> 00:14:44,974
Okay.

147
00:14:44,976 --> 00:14:46,943
All right. Push.

148
00:14:49,948 --> 00:14:52,982
Slow, slow, slow.
Corner, corner, corner.

149
00:15:06,965 --> 00:15:09,632
Yeah. Get that one.

150
00:15:26,851 --> 00:15:29,418
Hi, Paige, how are you?

151
00:15:30,755 --> 00:15:34,257
Yeah. I mean, no. No, it's fine.

152
00:15:35,693 --> 00:15:37,193
Uh-huh.

153
00:15:40,298 --> 00:15:41,831
What?

154
00:15:43,468 --> 00:15:44,534
Well...

155
00:15:44,536 --> 00:15:47,236
Yes. Of course.

156
00:15:47,806 --> 00:15:49,806
Right. I understand.

157
00:15:49,974 --> 00:15:51,507
Okay.

158
00:15:52,177 --> 00:15:56,078
Yeah, that would be perfect.
I'll see you then.

159
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,682
Great. And, uh, listen,
Paige, thank you.

160
00:15:59,818 --> 00:16:01,951
Thank you.

161
00:16:08,293 --> 00:16:09,792
Ah...uh...

162
00:16:10,695 --> 00:16:12,328
Jimmy?

163
00:16:12,397 --> 00:16:14,063
What? What's up?

164
00:16:14,065 --> 00:16:15,598
I, uh...

165
00:16:16,801 --> 00:16:19,836
I just got Mesa Verde back.

166
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,472
Seriously?

167
00:16:23,474 --> 00:16:25,408
Seriously.

168
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:28,578
Holy shit, that's unbelievable!

169
00:16:29,647 --> 00:16:32,348
I... What happened to HHM?

170
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,282
Uh, Paige didn't go into it.

171
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:34,884
She just said the filing
didn't go through.

172
00:16:34,886 --> 00:16:37,253
We're gonna meet this afternoon.

173
00:16:37,255 --> 00:16:39,355
Hey, what did I tell you?

174
00:16:39,357 --> 00:16:41,524
Sometimes the good guys win!

175
00:16:42,493 --> 00:16:45,328
Ugh. It sounds like there's
some regulatory issues.

176
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:49,232
Kevin's still worried that one
lawyer won't be able to handle it.

177
00:16:49,234 --> 00:16:49,966
- You can.
- Yeah...

178
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:51,634
I'm gonna have to get a paralegal.
Maybe two of them.

179
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:53,269
And I absolutely
will pay for it out of my end.

180
00:16:53,271 --> 00:16:55,738
No. Come on.
Split it down the middle.

181
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,107
You know what, I need
a Westlaw terminal right away.

182
00:16:58,109 --> 00:17:00,343
I don't even know
who to call to get that done.

183
00:17:00,345 --> 00:17:03,479
- These are high class problems.
- Yeah, but it's a major piece of work, Jimmy.

184
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:04,881
It's just... This is major.

185
00:17:04,883 --> 00:17:09,118
Hey, Kim, you got this.
All right? So, take a moment.

186
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,388
Breathe. Savor.

187
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,391
You know what? You're right.

188
00:17:15,393 --> 00:17:17,860
Damn right, I'm right.

189
00:17:28,473 --> 00:17:29,972
It's Ernie.

190
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:34,443
Hi, Ernie. What's up?

191
00:17:36,547 --> 00:17:39,782
Yeah. No, Paige just called me.

192
00:17:40,118 --> 00:17:41,450
Uh-huh.

193
00:17:42,086 --> 00:17:44,453
Did Chuck say why...

194
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:47,123
So when...

195
00:17:48,393 --> 00:17:51,260
Sure. No time like the present.

196
00:17:51,963 --> 00:17:53,229
Okay.

197
00:17:53,231 --> 00:17:54,864
Thanks.

198
00:17:55,066 --> 00:17:56,632
The Mesa Verde files.

199
00:17:56,634 --> 00:17:59,235
Chuck's ready to turn
them over to me.

200
00:17:59,237 --> 00:18:00,836
Wow!

201
00:18:00,838 --> 00:18:01,904
Really?

202
00:18:01,906 --> 00:18:04,040
That was, uh, quick.

203
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:04,540
Yeah. I...

204
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:07,410
I'm gonna go change,
and get over there.

205
00:18:07,412 --> 00:18:08,511
Do you want some help?

206
00:18:08,513 --> 00:18:11,447
That depends. Are you gonna carry
boxes, or are you gonna gloat?

207
00:18:11,449 --> 00:18:15,685
Uh, some from Column A,
some from Column B.

208
00:18:17,855 --> 00:18:19,822
Ground yourself.

209
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:20,656
Sorry.

210
00:18:20,658 --> 00:18:22,625
Just touch the thing.

211
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:30,366
What the hell?
This thing doesn't...

212
00:18:31,269 --> 00:18:33,102
- Hey, Jimmy. Hey, Kim.
- Hey, Ernie.

213
00:18:33,104 --> 00:18:34,236
Something's wrong with the lock.

214
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,439
Mr. McGill had me call
a locksmith and change them.

215
00:18:36,441 --> 00:18:39,675
Yeah? Why did he do that?

216
00:18:43,448 --> 00:18:46,615
Hey, Chuck, why'd you
change the locks?

217
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:48,985
Ernesto, I think we're good.

218
00:18:48,987 --> 00:18:50,920
I'm sure you're needed
back at the office.

219
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:54,156
- Well, I'll get going then.
- Thanks.

220
00:18:54,158 --> 00:18:55,124
Bye, Jimmy. Bye, Kim.

221
00:18:55,126 --> 00:18:57,660
- Bye, Ernie.
- See you, Ernie.

222
00:18:57,662 --> 00:19:00,429
So, Chuck,
what's the deal with the locks?

223
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:05,301
Kim, I was hoping to have this
conversation with you, and you alone.

224
00:19:05,903 --> 00:19:07,136
However,

225
00:19:07,138 --> 00:19:10,773
I guess it's time to clear
the air once and for all.

226
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:13,843
Clear the air about what?

227
00:19:16,314 --> 00:19:18,347
He sabotaged me.

228
00:19:18,483 --> 00:19:20,783
- Buddy, what are you...
- Please.

229
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:21,884
Don't bother.

230
00:19:21,886 --> 00:19:25,588
You and I both know exactly
what I'm talking about.

231
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:26,622
I don't.

232
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:30,760
Yesterday morning was the worst
professional humiliation of my life.

233
00:19:30,762 --> 00:19:35,164
A single transpositional error
cost my client time and money,

234
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:38,601
and permanently damaged
my reputation.

235
00:19:38,903 --> 00:19:40,803
Then I realized,

236
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:42,905
it wasn't an error.

237
00:19:42,907 --> 00:19:44,874
Not at all.

238
00:19:45,943 --> 00:19:47,009
A week ago last night,

239
00:19:47,011 --> 00:19:49,845
I was right there, on that couch,

240
00:19:49,847 --> 00:19:51,547
barely conscious.

241
00:19:52,383 --> 00:19:54,850
And Jimmy showed up...

242
00:19:55,386 --> 00:19:58,054
...and he sent Ernesto away.

243
00:19:58,189 --> 00:20:02,058
My brother was gonna
take care of me.

244
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,993
And in the dead of night,

245
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:05,594
he went through
my Mesa Verde files.

246
00:20:05,596 --> 00:20:08,164
You know what?
We don't have to listen to this.

247
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,032
She does!

248
00:20:10,768 --> 00:20:12,268
You do.

249
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,437
For your own good.

250
00:20:14,739 --> 00:20:18,741
Now, in these files are 13
documents containing the address

251
00:20:18,743 --> 00:20:20,910
of Mesa Verde's proposed branch.

252
00:20:20,912 --> 00:20:25,815
1261 Rosella Drive,
Scottsdale, Arizona.

253
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,950
Jimmy pulled each and every one.

254
00:20:27,952 --> 00:20:30,786
Then left me here,
sweating and delirious,

255
00:20:30,788 --> 00:20:33,756
while he went off to doctor them.

256
00:20:33,758 --> 00:20:36,092
You'd need a photocopier for that.

257
00:20:36,094 --> 00:20:39,061
Where'd you go,
some all night copy shop?

258
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:42,264
With a little careful cutting
and pasting, he created duplicates,

259
00:20:42,266 --> 00:20:46,836
virtually identical to my originals,
but with one key change.

260
00:20:46,838 --> 00:20:51,240
1261 Rosella Drive
became 1216 Rosella Drive.

261
00:20:51,242 --> 00:20:53,109
This is sounding
like a lot of work.

262
00:20:53,111 --> 00:20:55,311
No one ever accused you
of being lazy.

263
00:20:55,313 --> 00:20:57,446
Every other sin in the book,
but not that one.

264
00:20:57,448 --> 00:21:00,950
And if you're wondering if Jimmy's
up to a little casual forgery,

265
00:21:00,952 --> 00:21:01,617
you should know,

266
00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:05,187
in high school, he had a thriving
business making fake IDs

267
00:21:05,189 --> 00:21:06,288
so his buddies could buy beer.

268
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:08,591
You're going all the way
back to high school, huh?

269
00:21:08,593 --> 00:21:10,993
Hey, you and Mozart, huh?

270
00:21:11,329 --> 00:21:13,395
You both started young.

271
00:21:13,598 --> 00:21:17,466
He came back here,
and put his new versions in my files.

272
00:21:17,468 --> 00:21:23,639
And then, the next day,
my caring brother took his leave.

273
00:21:23,975 --> 00:21:25,574
He knew that I would use
his modified documents

274
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:29,678
to write Mesa Verde's submission
to the state regulator.

275
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,646
And so I did.

276
00:21:30,648 --> 00:21:36,085
Over and over,
I typed 1216 instead of 1261.

277
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:39,188
I remember thinking,
"1216 Rosella Drive,

278
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:42,892
that's just one year after 1215,

279
00:21:42,894 --> 00:21:44,527
the year the Magna Carta was signed."

280
00:21:44,529 --> 00:21:47,663
Jesus, Chuck. You are unbelievable.

281
00:21:47,665 --> 00:21:50,132
So, you're saying,
if we look in here,

282
00:21:50,134 --> 00:21:51,133
all the addresses will be wrong?

283
00:21:51,135 --> 00:21:54,537
Well, of course you weren't
gonna leave evidence behind.

284
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:58,607
I'm guessing, yesterday morning
you waited until I left,

285
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:03,479
then used your key to let yourself
in and return the originals.

286
00:22:03,481 --> 00:22:06,315
No crime is complete
without the cover-up.

287
00:22:06,317 --> 00:22:07,016
Oh, come on.

288
00:22:07,018 --> 00:22:10,753
I did all this, what,
for some business?

289
00:22:14,358 --> 00:22:16,292
He did it for you.

290
00:22:20,031 --> 00:22:23,032
Well, I'm sure you didn't
know anything about it.

291
00:22:23,034 --> 00:22:24,200
I believe he went off on his own,

292
00:22:24,202 --> 00:22:27,836
and did this as some kind
of twisted romantic gesture.

293
00:22:27,838 --> 00:22:31,740
Chuck, I think you need to lie down
with a cold washcloth on your head.

294
00:22:31,742 --> 00:22:35,644
Now that you know,
you have no choice.

295
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:36,979
This is about a client.

296
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:39,882
A client who has been defrauded.

297
00:22:39,884 --> 00:22:40,883
As a sworn officer of the court,

298
00:22:40,885 --> 00:22:44,420
as Mesa Verde's attorney of record,
you have no recourse

299
00:22:44,422 --> 00:22:47,523
but to go to Kevin Wachtell
and make a full disclosure.

300
00:22:47,525 --> 00:22:51,760
This whole song and dance is all
about getting his client back.

301
00:22:51,762 --> 00:22:53,095
That's all this is.

302
00:22:53,097 --> 00:22:53,796
Not in the least.

303
00:22:53,798 --> 00:22:55,397
If, knowing the truth,
they still decide to go...

304
00:22:55,399 --> 00:22:58,734
You can't stand the fact
that they chose her over you.

305
00:22:58,736 --> 00:23:02,738
I can't stand the fact my own
brother stabbed me in the back!

306
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,373
I can't stand the fact
that you've deceived

307
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:06,175
and ruined this fine young woman!

308
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:08,777
Ruined? What is this, the 1840s?

309
00:23:08,779 --> 00:23:10,112
What are you talking about?

310
00:23:10,114 --> 00:23:11,347
She's not ruined!

311
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:12,915
Jimmy.

312
00:23:17,955 --> 00:23:20,489
If what you're saying is true,

313
00:23:20,491 --> 00:23:23,792
Jimmy could be
charged with forgery,

314
00:23:23,794 --> 00:23:26,395
fraud, falsifying evidence,

315
00:23:26,397 --> 00:23:27,796
even breaking and entering.

316
00:23:27,798 --> 00:23:30,432
Frankly, I'm sick about this.

317
00:23:30,434 --> 00:23:32,468
But facts are facts.

318
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:36,505
And what is your evidence?

319
00:23:37,575 --> 00:23:38,407
My evidence...

320
00:23:38,409 --> 00:23:42,945
My evidence is knowing my
brother for his entire life.

321
00:23:43,147 --> 00:23:45,547
Chuck, I think there
is another explanation.

322
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,683
It's a simpler one.

323
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,219
You made a mistake.

324
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:50,819
I did not.

325
00:23:50,821 --> 00:23:52,054
You're working by lantern light,

326
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:55,090
squinting over 10-point type
for hour after hour.

327
00:23:55,092 --> 00:23:57,693
Mistakenly changing 1261 to 1216

328
00:23:57,695 --> 00:23:59,328
would be the most natural
thing in the world.

329
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:00,829
It could certainly happen to me.

330
00:24:00,831 --> 00:24:03,299
I did not make a mistake!

331
00:24:04,702 --> 00:24:05,334
I believe you did.

332
00:24:05,336 --> 00:24:06,969
Look, I understand that you have

333
00:24:06,971 --> 00:24:08,871
great affection for Jimmy.

334
00:24:08,873 --> 00:24:09,705
A great many people do.

335
00:24:09,707 --> 00:24:11,273
But please, open your eyes here!

336
00:24:11,275 --> 00:24:14,810
You made a mistake,
and instead of just facing up to it,

337
00:24:14,812 --> 00:24:17,313
you accuse your brother
of plotting against you.

338
00:24:17,315 --> 00:24:19,448
You come up with this
elaborate scheme...

339
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:21,617
He's capable of this.
You know he is.

340
00:24:21,619 --> 00:24:24,586
I know he's not perfect.

341
00:24:25,523 --> 00:24:28,123
And I know he cuts corners.

342
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:31,226
But you're the one who
made him this way.

343
00:24:31,996 --> 00:24:34,196
He idolizes you.

344
00:24:34,198 --> 00:24:35,964
He accepts you.

345
00:24:35,966 --> 00:24:37,666
He takes care of you.

346
00:24:37,668 --> 00:24:41,704
And all he ever wanted
was your love and support.

347
00:24:41,706 --> 00:24:44,973
But all you've ever done
is judge him.

348
00:24:44,975 --> 00:24:46,608
You never believed in him.

349
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:50,045
You never wanted him to succeed.

350
00:24:53,718 --> 00:24:55,684
And you know what?

351
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:01,223
I feel sorry for him.

352
00:25:05,096 --> 00:25:07,763
And I feel sorry for you.

353
00:25:41,932 --> 00:25:44,600
Jesus! What?

354
00:25:46,404 --> 00:25:48,170
Kim, what?

355
00:25:51,242 --> 00:25:53,308
Just drive.

356
00:26:18,235 --> 00:26:21,670
All right, line up by class!

357
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:23,605
Find your buddy!

358
00:26:38,389 --> 00:26:39,822
Let's go.

359
00:26:57,942 --> 00:26:59,074
Come on. Come on.

360
00:26:59,076 --> 00:26:59,775
Plant yourself.

361
00:26:59,777 --> 00:27:01,710
- Here?
- Yeah, right there.

362
00:27:01,712 --> 00:27:03,812
- All right.
- About yea high.

363
00:27:03,814 --> 00:27:05,848
Aim it up at me. Heroic.

364
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:06,982
Heroic? Good luck with that.

365
00:27:06,984 --> 00:27:08,517
Just frame me up. All right?

366
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:11,086
Make sure you get the neck, okay?
It's a low angle shot.

367
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:12,054
- Okay.
- Hey, you know what?

368
00:27:12,056 --> 00:27:14,223
- Let me see.
- Oh, it's just base.

369
00:27:14,225 --> 00:27:15,491
What, am I dying of consumption?

370
00:27:15,493 --> 00:27:17,759
Well, at your age,
you don't want to look too red.

371
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,528
It looks like rosacea.

372
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:20,295
And what's with all the...

373
00:27:20,297 --> 00:27:22,464
I'm just trying to make it
look like you have a jawline.

374
00:27:22,466 --> 00:27:24,500
I do have a jawline.

375
00:27:24,502 --> 00:27:27,870
You know what?
You stand in for me.

376
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:29,171
Crouch down. Okay.

377
00:27:29,173 --> 00:27:33,342
Move to your left. The other left.
More. More. Okay. Boom!

378
00:27:33,344 --> 00:27:34,510
That's what I'm talking about.
You got it.

379
00:27:34,512 --> 00:27:37,446
Dude, there's gotta be an
easier way to get this shot.

380
00:27:37,448 --> 00:27:38,180
Not for free.

381
00:27:38,182 --> 00:27:40,816
You wanna be a filmmaker,
grow a pair.

382
00:27:40,885 --> 00:27:42,417
Here we go. Picture's up.

383
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:44,052
Okay, let's do this.

384
00:27:44,054 --> 00:27:45,888
Last looks.

385
00:27:47,424 --> 00:27:50,759
Rhubarb! Rhubarb! Nine o' clock!

386
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:54,129
Excuse me.

387
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:56,365
- Hi, are you in charge here?
- Yes, I am.

388
00:27:56,367 --> 00:27:57,766
And this is school property.

389
00:27:57,768 --> 00:27:59,768
You're just the person
I wanna speak to.

390
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:00,769
It would be incredibly helpful

391
00:28:00,771 --> 00:28:03,038
if you can get those kids
and that building over there

392
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,706
to just keep it down for a bit.

393
00:28:04,708 --> 00:28:06,408
Just give them a worksheet
or something?

394
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:07,643
I mean, just two or three minutes,
just for sound.

395
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:12,080
This is school property, and no one
is allowed here without permission.

396
00:28:12,082 --> 00:28:13,849
Of course not.

397
00:28:15,219 --> 00:28:17,452
You didn't speak to Annette?

398
00:28:17,454 --> 00:28:17,920
Annette?

399
00:28:17,922 --> 00:28:19,288
In the superintendent's office.

400
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:22,858
- Do you know an Annette downtown?
- I don't think so.

401
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,060
Well, I'm sorry about the mix-up.

402
00:28:25,062 --> 00:28:28,830
We're shooting what's called
an establishing shot.

403
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,432
- Five minutes tops.
- You're not shooting anything

404
00:28:30,434 --> 00:28:33,669
until I'm clear on what's
going on here.

405
00:28:33,671 --> 00:28:34,469
The documentary.

406
00:28:34,471 --> 00:28:36,705
We're making a documentary.
That's... Oh...

407
00:28:36,707 --> 00:28:39,808
I was told there was a display
or a plaque of some kind.

408
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:41,143
Would you know
where that would be?

409
00:28:41,145 --> 00:28:42,911
Why would we have a plaque?

410
00:28:42,913 --> 00:28:45,080
Because of who went
to school here.

411
00:28:45,082 --> 00:28:46,748
Who went to school here?

412
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:50,252
Rupert Holmes. That's who
the documentary is about.

413
00:28:50,254 --> 00:28:51,320
I'm sorry, who?

414
00:28:51,322 --> 00:28:53,722
Rupert Holmes. You know.

415
00:28:54,258 --> 00:28:55,324
Rupert Holmes!

416
00:28:55,326 --> 00:28:56,024
The singer songwriter.

417
00:28:56,026 --> 00:29:00,062
You know, uh,
<i>The Pina Colada Song.</i>

418
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:03,532
I mean, sure you do. I...

419
00:29:06,704 --> 00:29:08,904

420
00:29:08,906 --> 00:29:11,707

425
00:29:20,985 --> 00:29:22,517
See? Look at her face.

426
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:24,119
- Rupert Holmes.
- He went to school here?

427
00:29:24,121 --> 00:29:27,656
Yeah. Class of '64.
He still talks about it.

428
00:29:27,658 --> 00:29:28,657
But the school was built in '71.

429
00:29:28,659 --> 00:29:32,560
Hmm. He was a student in the old
building that used to be here.

430
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:35,998
We're taking a little, what do
you call it, "artistic liberties."

431
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,201
Isn't Rupert Holmes English?

432
00:29:40,938 --> 00:29:43,572
Well, yeah. And that's
some great trivia.

433
00:29:43,574 --> 00:29:48,777
But he spent his formative years
right here in Albuquerque.

434
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:49,878
I'll tell you what?

435
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,247
Why don't you call Annette down
in the superintendent's office?

436
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:54,816
And we'll just stay here
till you get official word.

437
00:29:54,818 --> 00:29:56,785
- Well, if you don't mind waiting.
- Not at all.

438
00:29:56,787 --> 00:29:57,886
We don't want to break any rules.

439
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:00,155
It shouldn't take very long,
I'm sure.

440
00:30:00,157 --> 00:30:00,689
And no promises,

441
00:30:00,691 --> 00:30:03,325
but I'll see what I can do about
getting the kids to quiet down.

442
00:30:03,327 --> 00:30:05,794
Oh, that would be super helpful.

443
00:30:16,407 --> 00:30:18,907
Chop-chop! Magic time!

444
00:30:19,476 --> 00:30:20,442
Come on, let's go.

445
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:23,345
No last looks!
Just the flag, the flag!

446
00:30:23,347 --> 00:30:24,613
Okay, remember, heroic.

447
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:26,782
Yeah, you're a hero.

448
00:30:26,784 --> 00:30:28,083
Big, big hero.

449
00:30:28,085 --> 00:30:29,718
Gravitas.

450
00:30:30,854 --> 00:30:33,021
Hey! Hey, hey, hey.

451
00:30:36,593 --> 00:30:37,626
Go.

452
00:30:37,628 --> 00:30:39,795
Dolly, dolly.

453
00:30:39,797 --> 00:30:41,596
Dolly, dolly.

454
00:30:41,899 --> 00:30:43,331
Nice.

455
00:30:43,834 --> 00:30:45,767
Nice.

456
00:31:02,553 --> 00:31:03,185
Hey, Mike.

457
00:31:03,187 --> 00:31:05,987
Hey, Fran.
Are you still serving breakfast?

458
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:07,322
For you? Sure.

459
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:10,492
- The usual?
- Uh, that'd be great.

460
00:31:22,406 --> 00:31:23,972
- Thanks.
- Mmm-hmm.

461
00:31:23,974 --> 00:31:25,841
Anything good in the paper?

462
00:31:25,843 --> 00:31:29,311
No. Was there ever
anything good in the paper?

463
00:31:29,313 --> 00:31:32,447
Not too often.

464
00:31:32,983 --> 00:31:34,616
Hey, Fran?

465
00:31:34,618 --> 00:31:35,917
Hmm?

466
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:37,853
I gotta ask.

467
00:31:40,057 --> 00:31:42,057
Does it ever snow around here?

468
00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:43,125
Sure it does.

469
00:31:43,127 --> 00:31:45,961
This gonna be your first
winter in Albuquerque?

470
00:31:45,963 --> 00:31:47,896
Yeah. I'm out from Philadelphia.

471
00:31:47,898 --> 00:31:50,899
Yeah. It depends on the year.

472
00:31:50,901 --> 00:31:51,566
Hmm.

473
00:31:51,568 --> 00:31:52,701
If you stay around long enough,

474
00:31:52,703 --> 00:31:55,403
you'll have something
to shovel, don't you worry.

475
00:31:55,405 --> 00:31:57,072
That suits me.

476
00:31:57,074 --> 00:31:59,574
I live up in Cedar Crest,
we get plenty.

477
00:31:59,576 --> 00:32:02,978
You can shovel my drive
if you're looking for more.

478
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:03,979
Just say the word.

479
00:32:03,981 --> 00:32:05,781
Yeah, well...

480
00:32:05,783 --> 00:32:08,950
Miss! Cheque, please.

481
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,412
Yeah.

482
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:39,614
<i>We gotta talk.</i>

483
00:32:50,861 --> 00:32:53,261
I've got something I need to know.

484
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:55,831
And I need to know it fast.

485
00:32:56,867 --> 00:33:00,335
- What's that?
- We got hit the other day.

486
00:33:00,337 --> 00:33:04,873
A truck headed south got hijacked,
someone stole a quarter million.

487
00:33:04,875 --> 00:33:08,910
Now Hector's flippin' out,
looking for who did it.

488
00:33:08,912 --> 00:33:10,745
Thing is,

489
00:33:11,915 --> 00:33:14,149
I think it was you.

490
00:33:15,185 --> 00:33:17,085
They left the driver hogtied,

491
00:33:17,087 --> 00:33:18,253
not a mark on him.

492
00:33:18,255 --> 00:33:21,122
Anyone in the game would've capped
him without a second thought.

493
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:23,558
But this driver,
he's still breathing.

494
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,860
I thought to myself,
"Who's the guy

495
00:33:24,862 --> 00:33:28,563
who'll rip off a couple
hundred thousand in drug money,

496
00:33:28,565 --> 00:33:30,966
and leave a witness?"

497
00:33:30,968 --> 00:33:35,036
"Who's the guy
who won't pull the trigger?"

498
00:33:36,707 --> 00:33:38,240
You.

499
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,685
I'm not here to squeeze you.

500
00:33:50,687 --> 00:33:52,754
You wanna rip off the cartel,
that's your business.

501
00:33:52,756 --> 00:33:57,125
But here's the thing.
I'm picking up that driver.

502
00:33:57,361 --> 00:33:58,860
Hector's orders.

503
00:33:58,862 --> 00:34:02,264
We're gonna see what he knows.
And if he knows you,

504
00:34:02,266 --> 00:34:04,466
that's bad for both of us.

505
00:34:04,468 --> 00:34:05,433
That shouldn't concern you.

506
00:34:05,435 --> 00:34:07,235
But he was in on it, right?

507
00:34:07,237 --> 00:34:08,937
The driver had nothing
to do with it.

508
00:34:08,939 --> 00:34:10,305
- Then who?
- Just me.

509
00:34:10,307 --> 00:34:14,009
You're telling me you did this
without someone on the inside?

510
00:34:14,011 --> 00:34:18,480
Not possible.
How did you know about the truck?

511
00:34:18,482 --> 00:34:20,148
How do you know about the tyres?

512
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:20,982
All I can tell you is,

513
00:34:20,984 --> 00:34:24,452
you guys aren't half as smart
as you think you are.

514
00:34:24,788 --> 00:34:29,090
So, the driver
doesn't know anything?

515
00:34:29,092 --> 00:34:30,258
Not a thing.

516
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,126
- He hear your voice?
- No.

517
00:34:31,128 --> 00:34:32,260
Right now, Hector's looking
at the competition,

518
00:34:32,262 --> 00:34:35,096
but if he hears the driver
say it was some old <i>gringo...</i>

519
00:34:35,098 --> 00:34:36,131
He didn't hear me.

520
00:34:36,133 --> 00:34:39,000
Saw a guy with a ski mask,
that's it.

521
00:34:39,002 --> 00:34:41,036
And that's for sure?

522
00:34:41,138 --> 00:34:42,704
Yeah.

523
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,907
You'd better be right.

524
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:48,576
Why wasn't it in the papers?

525
00:34:49,012 --> 00:34:49,878
What?

526
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:54,916
The truck robbery. The cops
keeping it out of the papers?

527
00:34:55,085 --> 00:34:56,718
The cops?

528
00:34:58,188 --> 00:35:00,021
The cops don't know shit about it.

529
00:35:00,023 --> 00:35:01,623
How's that?

530
00:35:02,693 --> 00:35:05,226
Is that what this is about?

531
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:09,030
You wanted to put the cops
onto Hector? Why?

532
00:35:09,032 --> 00:35:13,435
You are nothing to him.
He forgot all about you.

533
00:35:13,704 --> 00:35:15,603
I haven't forgotten him.

534
00:35:15,605 --> 00:35:17,305
You put me in the shit,

535
00:35:17,307 --> 00:35:21,710
just 'cause you got it in
for Hector Salamanca?

536
00:35:21,945 --> 00:35:26,081
Listen, you put the cops on him,
you put them on me.

537
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:28,416
Doing it for the money, I get it.

538
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:31,519
But this shit, that's insane.

539
00:35:31,521 --> 00:35:33,989
You need to calm yourself down.

540
00:35:33,991 --> 00:35:38,426
And you need to take that
hand out of that pocket.

541
00:35:54,678 --> 00:35:57,746
And just so you know, it's over.

542
00:35:57,748 --> 00:36:00,448
I'm done with your boss.

543
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:03,418
Whatever.

544
00:36:04,921 --> 00:36:08,223
Why wasn't it in the papers?

545
00:36:08,658 --> 00:36:10,859
Because we cleaned it up.

546
00:36:11,928 --> 00:36:13,028
How's that?

547
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:14,462
We got lucky.

548
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,464
After you left,
a good Samaritan came along

549
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:19,768
and said,
"Oh, my God. Oh, my God."

550
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:22,203
He cut the driver loose.
The driver called us.

551
00:36:22,205 --> 00:36:24,906
We came out, got the truck.

552
00:36:25,075 --> 00:36:27,776
Made it like it never happened.

553
00:36:31,515 --> 00:36:34,249
And that good Samaritan?

554
00:36:35,152 --> 00:36:37,786
Hector shot him in the face.

555
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:41,523
We buried the guy
out in the desert.

556
00:36:41,525 --> 00:36:43,525
Like I said,

557
00:36:44,227 --> 00:36:46,127
we cleaned it up.

558
00:37:30,107 --> 00:37:31,072
How was your day?

559
00:37:31,074 --> 00:37:33,541
You know. I met with
Paige and Kevin,

560
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:37,245
interviewed some paralegals.

561
00:37:37,948 --> 00:37:41,649
And, uh, this. What about you?

562
00:37:42,819 --> 00:37:44,953
Finished the commercial.

563
00:37:45,822 --> 00:37:46,588
I don't wanna oversell it,

564
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:49,491
but I think it might be
the greatest 60 seconds

565
00:37:49,493 --> 00:37:52,393
in the history of television.

566
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:58,867
Tomorrow morning, uh,
somewhere between 11:18 and 11:35,

567
00:37:58,869 --> 00:38:04,973
stop what you're doing, and tune
into <i>Diagnosis Murder.</i>

568
00:38:05,041 --> 00:38:07,242
I'll make a point of it.

569
00:38:16,019 --> 00:38:18,686
You wanna talk about this?

570
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:22,957
Not now, not ever.

571
00:38:28,031 --> 00:38:29,964
I'm just gonna say,

572
00:38:31,301 --> 00:38:36,304
you are meant for Mesa Verde,
and they are meant for you.

573
00:38:36,306 --> 00:38:40,508
So, all is right with the world.

574
00:38:50,187 --> 00:38:52,020
Goodnight.

575
00:38:54,057 --> 00:38:55,757
Goodnight.

576
00:39:08,672 --> 00:39:12,040
Your brother is one smart lawyer.

577
00:39:12,576 --> 00:39:16,811
The smartest one I know.
I mean, no offence.

578
00:39:19,449 --> 00:39:22,150
He'd make quite an adversary.

579
00:39:22,519 --> 00:39:24,752
You better believe it.

580
00:39:26,456 --> 00:39:32,460
The kind of adversary who'd find even
the smallest crack in your defense.

581
00:39:37,467 --> 00:39:40,902
Going against him,
you'd really want to make sure

582
00:39:40,904 --> 00:39:46,608
you've got all your I's dotted
and your T's crossed.

583
00:39:51,848 --> 00:39:54,749
Nothing for him to find.

584
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,399
Hey, how you doin'?

585
00:41:18,401 --> 00:41:21,336
Be with you in a minute.

586
00:41:27,744 --> 00:41:29,610
Remember me?

587
00:41:34,984 --> 00:41:36,484
Uh...

588
00:41:37,654 --> 00:41:38,786
No.

589
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:42,357
I got a weird feeling
you do, Lance.

590
00:41:44,728 --> 00:41:47,128
Tonight is a funny night.

591
00:41:47,697 --> 00:41:50,164
For some reason tonight,

592
00:41:50,166 --> 00:41:53,968
I feel like I've got
all the answers.

593
00:41:54,671 --> 00:41:57,505
I'm feeling kinda like, uh...

594
00:41:58,241 --> 00:41:59,006
Like Carnac.

595
00:41:59,008 --> 00:42:01,476
You remember when Johnny
Carson used to do Carnac?

596
00:42:01,478 --> 00:42:03,411
And he'd give the answers
before the questions.

597
00:42:03,413 --> 00:42:06,781
You know, Ed would give
him the envelope, yeah?

598
00:42:06,783 --> 00:42:09,150
And Johnny would hold it up
to his forehead,

599
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:12,086
and, uh, he'd give the answer.

600
00:42:12,088 --> 00:42:14,822
Like, <i>Leave it to Beaver.</i>

601
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:17,125
Then Johnny'd tear
open the envelope.

602
00:42:17,127 --> 00:42:18,559
And there's the question.

603
00:42:18,561 --> 00:42:22,497
"What did the dead raccoon
say in his will?"

604
00:42:22,799 --> 00:42:24,799
That ring a bell?

605
00:42:25,902 --> 00:42:27,535
Before your time?

606
00:42:27,871 --> 00:42:29,003
All right, well,
let's cut to the chase.

607
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:33,508
Um, the guy who just walked
out of here, his name is Ernie.

608
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:34,575
I'm guessing he showed
you my picture

609
00:42:34,577 --> 00:42:36,811
and asked if I was in here
the other night.

610
00:42:36,813 --> 00:42:40,748
Now he's going to bring
his boss, who is my brother.

611
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:42,316
And he's gonna ask you
the same question.

612
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:44,485
"Did you see that guy
the other night?"

613
00:42:44,487 --> 00:42:47,889
Well, the answer is no.

614
00:42:48,224 --> 00:42:50,091
You feel me?

615
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:53,928
You murder someone?

616
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:55,396
Nope.

617
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:57,799
Rob a bank?

618
00:42:57,801 --> 00:42:59,400
No way am I that cool. No.

619
00:42:59,402 --> 00:43:03,471
I... Sometimes,
I go number two, and I don't flush.

620
00:43:03,473 --> 00:43:07,041
But this is just a thing
between brothers.

621
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:09,410
And we're both lawyers, so...

622
00:43:09,412 --> 00:43:13,147
Right. I mean, that's a
long and boring story.

623
00:43:13,149 --> 00:43:14,715
You don't wanna know.

624
00:43:17,687 --> 00:43:21,622
Is this gonna get me
jammed up with the cops?

625
00:43:21,691 --> 00:43:26,861
My brother might make it
sound like that, but no.

626
00:43:27,297 --> 00:43:29,363
It's just family.

627
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:35,970
Then I feel you.

628
00:43:39,175 --> 00:43:40,441
Hey, tell me about the cameras?

629
00:43:40,443 --> 00:43:44,078
Oh, uh...
They go to a VCR in the back.

630
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:48,449
It tapes for 12 hours,
and then records over itself.

631
00:43:48,451 --> 00:43:51,018
Right. So I'm on there now?

632
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:55,022
How hard would it be to erase?

633
00:43:55,258 --> 00:43:56,691
Hmm...

634
00:43:56,693 --> 00:43:58,259
I don't know.

635
00:43:58,261 --> 00:44:02,363
Could be tricky and expensive.

636
00:44:02,899 --> 00:44:05,066
Like 100 bucks expensive?

637
00:44:05,068 --> 00:44:08,002
Like 200 bucks expensive.

638
00:44:09,072 --> 00:44:12,139
You will go far, my young friend.

639
00:44:49,412 --> 00:44:51,245
Uh... Good evening.

640
00:44:51,614 --> 00:44:52,446
Uh...

641
00:44:52,448 --> 00:44:54,048
Lance, is it?

642
00:44:54,050 --> 00:44:54,882
Yeah.

643
00:44:54,884 --> 00:44:55,650
Lance, I'm Charles McGill.

644
00:44:55,652 --> 00:45:02,256
Uh, my associate, um, spoke with you
earlier, and he showed you this photo.

645
00:45:02,258 --> 00:45:03,257
Um...

646
00:45:03,259 --> 00:45:06,427
On or about the morning
of the 18th,

647
00:45:06,429 --> 00:45:09,564
this person was here in this shop,
is that correct?

648
00:45:09,566 --> 00:45:10,398
Uh...

649
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,766
On or about the...

650
00:45:11,768 --> 00:45:14,535
The 18th, early morning.

651
00:45:18,174 --> 00:45:19,473
No.

652
00:45:20,543 --> 00:45:21,509
Well, I...

653
00:45:21,511 --> 00:45:23,911
I believe you told my
associate that he was here,

654
00:45:23,913 --> 00:45:26,013
and that he made copies.

655
00:45:26,616 --> 00:45:29,550
Yeah, but...

656
00:45:29,552 --> 00:45:31,319
Sorry, no.

657
00:45:33,022 --> 00:45:34,488
Yeah.

658
00:45:35,058 --> 00:45:36,891
That's my guy.

659
00:45:38,061 --> 00:45:40,194
All right, the, uh...

660
00:45:40,563 --> 00:45:42,663
The night of Tuesday the 17th,

661
00:45:42,665 --> 00:45:45,800
leading into early Wednesday,

662
00:45:45,802 --> 00:45:47,702
the early hours of Wednesday,

663
00:45:47,704 --> 00:45:48,803
of the 18th...

664
00:45:48,805 --> 00:45:52,773
Were you in fact here?
Can we establish that?

665
00:45:52,775 --> 00:45:56,410
I mean, I work graveyard.

666
00:45:56,646 --> 00:45:58,412
So, yeah.

667
00:45:59,015 --> 00:46:00,948
Stay strong, Lance.

668
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:04,619
Was this man here making copies?

669
00:46:06,155 --> 00:46:09,657
Yeah. It's like I said,
I don't think so.

670
00:46:09,659 --> 00:46:11,192
Well, earlier you said
that he was here.

671
00:46:11,194 --> 00:46:14,462
Now you're saying
that he wasn't. Which is it?

672
00:46:14,464 --> 00:46:17,598
Uh, yeah. Well, when that guy
showed me the picture,

673
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:18,866
I thought maybe.

674
00:46:18,868 --> 00:46:21,969
But now that I'm seeing it again...

675
00:46:22,205 --> 00:46:27,041
Uh, sorry, don't know what to
tell you, guess I was wrong.

676
00:46:27,043 --> 00:46:29,343
Son, listen carefully,

677
00:46:29,345 --> 00:46:33,381
I'm an officer of the court,
investigating a felony.

678
00:46:33,383 --> 00:46:34,749
So, you're a cop?

679
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:36,217
No. No, I'm not. I'm...

680
00:46:36,219 --> 00:46:38,586
Mr. McGill,
maybe we better get you home.

681
00:46:38,588 --> 00:46:44,158
Ernesto, do not speak to me
as if I were a child. I'm fine.

682
00:46:52,869 --> 00:46:55,870
I am not a police officer.
I am an attorney.

683
00:46:55,872 --> 00:46:58,339
And I have a moral
and legal obligation

684
00:46:58,341 --> 00:47:00,675
to get to the bottom
of this matter.

685
00:47:00,677 --> 00:47:01,809
The bottom of what?

686
00:47:01,811 --> 00:47:06,881
Forgery, fraud,
falsifying evidence.

687
00:47:09,552 --> 00:47:10,685
Breaking and entering.

688
00:47:10,687 --> 00:47:12,186
This guy, is he okay?

689
00:47:12,188 --> 00:47:13,454
There is nothing wrong with me.

690
00:47:13,456 --> 00:47:16,257
Mr. McGill,
maybe we could just take a break.

691
00:47:16,259 --> 00:47:17,858
Ernie, shut up!

692
00:47:19,862 --> 00:47:21,595
You think about the choice
you're making.

693
00:47:21,597 --> 00:47:24,031
I already told you he wasn't here.

694
00:47:24,033 --> 00:47:26,233
What do you want me to say?

695
00:47:26,335 --> 00:47:28,436
I want you to speak the truth.

696
00:47:28,438 --> 00:47:31,639
I know he was here.
I know what he did.

697
00:47:31,641 --> 00:47:33,407
Tell me what you told Ernesto.

698
00:47:33,409 --> 00:47:34,675
Stop trying to change your story.

699
00:47:34,677 --> 00:47:38,112
Excuse me. Sorry.
How do we get this to do 11x14?

700
00:47:38,114 --> 00:47:40,414
No, excuse me,
we are having a conversation here!

701
00:47:40,416 --> 00:47:45,720
You gotta switch it to tray four.
It's easier if I tell you... Look.

702
00:47:49,592 --> 00:47:51,358
Dude... Okay. I... I...

703
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:55,396
I... I don't want any
problems here. So, just...

704
00:47:56,065 --> 00:47:58,632
Get him out of here,
or I'm gonna call the cops. Okay?

705
00:47:58,634 --> 00:48:00,634
Do not walk away from me.
We are not finished here.

706
00:48:00,636 --> 00:48:04,038
I am done talking to you, man!

707
00:48:26,295 --> 00:48:28,062
Call 9-1-1.

708
00:48:29,132 --> 00:48:31,732
Call 9-1-1. Come on.
