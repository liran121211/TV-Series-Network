1
00:00:59,293 --> 00:01:00,659
Ahead.

2
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:06,498
Turn to the left.

3
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:20,939
Step around
the back of the truck.

4
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:42,921
Okay.

5
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:53,332
Here you go.

6
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,983
You know,
I was willing to take you

7
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:54,119
to a more
high-end establishment.

8
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:56,088
This requires
a proper celebration,

9
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:58,423
so don't think
that this counts.

10
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:00,325
This is perfect.

11
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:03,261
Besides,

12
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:05,130
we're pinching pennies now.

13
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:06,732
When we have a steady
revenue stream,

14
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:08,734
make the drive up to
Geronimo every night.

15
00:06:08,736 --> 00:06:09,701
Till then...

16
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,371
Yes, that.
Let's make that happen.

17
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:16,141
Okay,
here's what you got to do.

18
00:06:16,143 --> 00:06:20,112
Type up your resignation
letter, now, I mean, tonight.

19
00:06:20,114 --> 00:06:21,246
Tonight? Yeah.

20
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:24,383
Well, I mean, finish your
hot dog first, but...

21
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:27,786
No, you put that letter
into Howard's office tonight.

22
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:30,589
It's on his premises. You've
officially given notice.

23
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:33,425
Tomorrow morning, while he's
still out on the back nine,

24
00:06:33,427 --> 00:06:34,192
chasing his balls,

25
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:36,395
you call Mesa Verde
and your other clients,

26
00:06:36,397 --> 00:06:38,964
you bring them along, you
get to them before he does!

27
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:41,366
No. What, "no"?

28
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:42,467
You gotta act now.

29
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:46,238
Listen, you do this "the
right way", you wait,

30
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,172
you tell Howard to his face,

31
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:49,374
he'll sink his dirty hooks
into Mesa Verde

32
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:52,077
before you get the words "I
quit" out of your mouth.

33
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,980
Okay, Jimmy,
I appreciate the advice.

34
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:55,714
But the whole point of this

35
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:57,749
is for you to be your kind of
lawyer, and me to be mine.

36
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:02,354
I need to find a way to do
this that's right for me.

37
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:25,510
Hey, Kim. Can we make this quick?
I'm kind of swamped right now.

38
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:27,379
Um, sure.
Thanks for meeting with me.

39
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:28,613
I only need a few minutes.

40
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:31,349
Great. What's up?

41
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:34,786
Howard, could we
do this in your office?

42
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,222
Please?

43
00:07:44,198 --> 00:07:45,363
Again, thanks for
taking the time.

44
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:49,134
You can just go ahead
and rip off the Band-Aid.

45
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:52,504
I have a pretty good idea
why you're here.

46
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:10,589
So, you're going
with Schweikart & Cokely.

47
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:12,524
I'm sorry? I heard.

48
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:14,192
Through the grapevine.

49
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:16,294
I'm not going to another firm.

50
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:17,329
I'm starting my own.

51
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:21,867
I figured I'd try giving it a
go as a solo practitioner.

52
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:26,905
Well, I...

53
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:30,041
Wow.

54
00:08:30,244 --> 00:08:32,978
I realized it was something
I needed to do.

55
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:37,716
The week Jimmy exits Davis &
Main, you decide to leave us?

56
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:40,986
That can't just
be happenstance.

57
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:43,588
It's not.

58
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,756
We're gonna be
sharing expenses.

59
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:48,727
One office, but two
separate practices.

60
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:52,531
Smart. On several counts.

61
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:54,699
Howard.

62
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:58,069
I want you to know that I
appreciate my time here.

63
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:00,672
I'm grateful for everything you
and the firm have done for me.

64
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:02,674
Especially the financial
help with my schooling.

65
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:05,343
And I'm ready to write a check
for the remainder of the loan.

66
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:07,812
I just need Accounting
to get me that figure.

67
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:11,316
No need. Our gift to you.

68
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:17,289
I don't know what to say. Um...

69
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:20,091
Thank you.

70
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:21,860
You earned it.

71
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:25,697
Tell you the truth,
I'm kind of envious.

72
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:26,731
Really? Why?

73
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:29,467
Something about a fresh start.

74
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:32,237
Back in the day,
right out of law school,

75
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:34,573
I thought long and hard about
hanging up my own shingle.

76
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:36,875
Yeah? Yeah.

77
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,377
I was ready to
take on the world.

78
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,613
Make a difference.

79
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:46,418
Dad talked me out of it.

80
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,053
Wanted me to
join the ranks here.

81
00:09:48,055 --> 00:09:51,089
Throw another "H"
in the firm's logo.

82
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:58,763
Things work out the way
they're supposed to, I guess.

83
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:05,704
Kim, I want you to know

84
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:08,340
that I always pushed you harder

85
00:10:08,342 --> 00:10:12,777
because I knew that I could
expect more from you.

86
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:15,180
Good luck to you.

87
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:19,451
Thank you.

88
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:30,562
<i> Julie, get me</i>
<i>Kevin Wachtell at Mesa Verde.</i>

89
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:33,732
<i>And cancel everything</i>
<i>I have lined up this morning.</i>

90
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:35,266
Calling now.

91
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:48,513
Sorry.

92
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:49,381
Excuse me.

93
00:10:49,383 --> 00:10:51,950
<i>Hi, Paige! It's Kim. Yeah, hi.</i>

94
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:56,688
Just checking that we're still
on for lunch on Monday?

95
00:10:57,891 --> 00:11:00,925
Great. And Kevin, too?

96
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:02,727
Good. Well, before we meet,

97
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:05,764
there's some news
you need to know about.

98
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:32,343
I am not the safe choice. The
safe choice for you would be HHM.

99
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:37,448
I believe, however,
that I am the right choice.

100
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,317
Why?

101
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:42,253
That suit you're wearing,
did you buy it off the rack?

102
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:44,923
Please don't tell me it
looks like I did.

103
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:47,759
If it did,
I wouldn't have asked.

104
00:13:47,761 --> 00:13:50,995
So, why do you prefer
a tailor-made suit?

105
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:54,566
Because it fits
you and you alone.

106
00:13:54,568 --> 00:14:00,104
Because each and every stitch was
fretted over with you in mind.

107
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:04,042
Either you fit the jacket,

108
00:14:04,744 --> 00:14:07,078
or the jacket fits you.

109
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:12,350
What if I want a whole
warehouse full of suits?

110
00:14:12,586 --> 00:14:14,285
That's a hell of
a lot of sewing.

111
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:17,088
How's one single tailor
gonna get that job done?

112
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,857
I know your
bank's needs in regard

113
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:21,125
to this expansion,
inside and out.

114
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:22,594
Having Mesa Verde
as my sole client

115
00:14:22,596 --> 00:14:26,931
will take up the entirety
of my attention, to be sure.

116
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:28,266
But if this were
beyond my abilities,

117
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:31,536
I wouldn't be
throwing my hat in the ring.

118
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:34,539
I would not waste your time.

119
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:36,841
Or mine.

120
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:50,388
Hey, Kim,
we're in here.

121
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:55,193
Perfect timing. I was
just getting the tour.

122
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:56,194
Kim, this is Steve. Hi.

123
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:57,328
Steve's the agent
for the place.

124
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,732
Hi. Kim. Nice to meet you.
Hi, Kim.

125
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:03,301
Everything okay?

126
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:06,938
Wow.

127
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,506
What do you think?

128
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:09,974
I...

129
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:13,511
I think it's a...
It's a dentist's office.

130
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:16,147
Two offices for two dentists.

131
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:21,352
Each the exact same size,
with a mirrored layout.

132
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:24,989
Here. The other one
is the next door over,

133
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:27,325
right beside this one.

134
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:27,792
Right here.

135
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:31,930
But they share one lobby,
one reception area.

136
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:33,898
So, egalitarian as hell.

137
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,768
Not to mention efficient!

138
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:42,140
Also, soundproofed walls.

139
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:44,842
What with the drilling
and the pain and the whatnot.

140
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:48,646
And the location,
I mean, holy crap!

141
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:51,215
I think this is the place.

142
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,688
Kim?

143
00:15:57,123 --> 00:16:00,325
Yeah, it's great.
Soundproofing.

144
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,994
Hey, Steve, would you
mind if we just...

145
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:05,563
Please, I'll step outside
and make some phone calls.

146
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:08,967
You all take all
the time you need.

147
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:14,806
Bad lunch?
Mesa Verde said no?

148
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:29,420
Okay. I'm getting
mixed signals here.

149
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:30,655
Is this a good...

150
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:33,257
Jimmy, I got it!

151
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:34,659
You got Mesa Verde? Yes!

152
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,861
I mean, there's nothing
in writing yet,

153
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,596
but the lunch went...

154
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:39,731
It kicked ass!

155
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:42,266
It was a little touch-and-go
there for a moment, I'll admit.

156
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:45,470
But Paige pitched in
and she really talked me up,

157
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:47,705
and then once
that door cracked open...

158
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:49,774
High-five! Fantastic.

159
00:16:49,776 --> 00:16:53,878
I had an answer for every
question, every concern!

160
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,749
And I did not badmouth HHM,
not at all, but I was, like,

161
00:16:57,751 --> 00:17:00,485
"Enthusiasm", you know?
And "Personal service",

162
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:02,420
because that's got to count
for something.

163
00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:03,955
Shit, yeah, that counts!

164
00:17:03,957 --> 00:17:04,522
Exactly! So...

165
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:08,192
I mean, 'cause, like, why were they
even at HHM in the first place?

166
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:08,694
Me! So...

167
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:10,161
And then when we walked
out of the restaurant,

168
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:12,897
when Kevin wasn't looking,
Paige gives me a thumbs-up.

169
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:16,134
But not the regular thumbs-up,
the double thumbs-up.

170
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:17,502
Two. Double-barrel.

171
00:17:17,504 --> 00:17:19,003
Boom, boom. Just like that!

172
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:21,172
I knew it.
I knew you could do it!

173
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:25,176
It was just...
God! It was perfect.

174
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:32,050
What?

175
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:37,188
I just... I love
seeing you like this.

176
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:41,392
So, are we gonna
keep these chairs?

177
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,462
Does that mean you
like this office?

178
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:47,065
Let's do it.

179
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:50,334
Hell yeah, let's do it!

180
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:02,814
Ernesto, the door's open!

181
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:05,183
As always.

182
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:08,052
Ernesto?

183
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:08,953
It's me, Chuck.

184
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:12,023
Hey, Howard.
Is Ernesto with you?

185
00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:12,790
No, it's just me.

186
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:16,327
Well, I expected a round
of documents an hour ago.

187
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:18,396
You know we got
a filing coming up.

188
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:19,530
I know, Chuck.

189
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:21,566
It's very possible...

190
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:25,069
It's likely that
we're losing Mesa Verde.

191
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:28,339
Losing them? We just got them.

192
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:30,641
Why? Where are they going?

193
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:33,311
They're going with Kim Wexler.

194
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:35,813
She left the firm.

195
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:37,782
Kim left?

196
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,252
Howard...

197
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:44,388
Well...

198
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,224
Where's she going?

199
00:18:46,226 --> 00:18:47,592
Is it Rich Schweikart?

200
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:48,593
Or did Reeves
and Green get her?

201
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:51,829
No. Not another firm. She's
going into private practice.

202
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:55,533
What?
Well, that's completely...

203
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:59,270
How is she going
out on her own?

204
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:01,472
Why is she going
out on her own?

205
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:02,440
Well, the why is the why.

206
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:07,111
The how is that she's
pooling her resources.

207
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:09,347
With Jimmy.

208
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:17,188
Kim and my brother.
Partners at law.

209
00:19:19,092 --> 00:19:20,224
He's Svengali.

210
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:22,160
The man is Svengali.

211
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:24,529
At any rate,
back to Mesa Verde.

212
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:27,598
I'm gonna try
one last Hail Mary.

213
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:30,234
Chuck? Mesa Verde.

214
00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:30,836
Yes. Listening.

215
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:32,570
I managed to get a meeting
with Kevin Wachtell.

216
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:33,938
He's coming in this afternoon.

217
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:37,408
But compliance law
is not my strong suit.

218
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,877
So, if you have any details,
any arguments,

219
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:40,845
bullet point them for me now,

220
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:45,082
because I've got about an hour
before I have to get back.

221
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:46,984
Chuck.

222
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,787
I really need your help here.

223
00:19:54,327 --> 00:19:55,860
Chuck?

224
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:02,500
Are you okay?

225
00:20:02,502 --> 00:20:04,902
I'm going to that meeting.
Chuck.

226
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:06,671
I don't know if
that's a good idea.

227
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:07,338
I can do it!

228
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,707
Force of will. And I've
been getting better.

229
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:14,712
I know you have, but the message
that we want to send...

230
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:15,980
I know the message!

231
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:18,316
That we appear professional
and not crazy!

232
00:20:18,318 --> 00:20:21,686
I'm going to the meeting,
and the lights stay on.

233
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:22,620
Everyone keeps their phones.

234
00:20:22,622 --> 00:20:27,725
Everything stays, for lack
of a better word, "normal".

235
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:31,329
I will make it through.

236
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,052
Yeah.

237
00:20:56,389 --> 00:20:57,888
They're here.

238
00:20:58,291 --> 00:20:59,724
Okay.

239
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:27,251
Hello, everyone.
Sorry I was delayed.

240
00:21:27,253 --> 00:21:28,486
Not at all. We just sat down.

241
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:31,522
Kevin Wachtell, Paige Novick,
this is Charles McGill.

242
00:21:31,524 --> 00:21:33,291
Chuck. Kevin. Paige.

243
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:34,925
Nice to meet you.

244
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:36,227
Thank you both
for coming.

245
00:21:36,229 --> 00:21:40,798
And don't worry, I'm not here
to extol the virtues of HHM.

246
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,000
I'm guessing you've
already had to suffer

247
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:45,336
through Howard's hard-sell
first time around,

248
00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:47,938
so, you've done your time,
as far as I'm concerned.

249
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:52,076
What hard-sell? It was enthusiasm!
I gave them cookies!

250
00:21:52,078 --> 00:21:54,245
Cookies were good, as I recall.

251
00:21:54,247 --> 00:21:55,846
No, I am here
to put your minds at ease.

252
00:21:55,848 --> 00:22:00,885
Kim Wexler is indeed the right
choice to handle Mesa Verde.

253
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:02,820
She's the obvious choice.

254
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:08,125
She's young, she's brilliant,
she's going places.

255
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:11,595
Let's face it, Howard.
She's the future.

256
00:22:11,597 --> 00:22:14,932
Two old guys like us?
We're the past.

257
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:18,436
Well, that's a sad thought.

258
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:19,904
Sad, but true.

259
00:22:19,906 --> 00:22:24,208
Banking law
needs to be exciting!

260
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,510
It needs the next generation
to come along

261
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,946
and give it a big old kick
in the seat of the pants!

262
00:22:28,948 --> 00:22:32,817
Really wake it up! Let me
tell you how boring I am.

263
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:37,388
I read FEC and ISO reports
for entertainment.

264
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:40,024
He does. I can attest to that.

265
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:42,026
Well,
I try to stay up on things.

266
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:43,861
The rules are
changing all the time.

267
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,964
With everything that's happened
with Enron and WorldCom,

268
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:48,499
the government
is extra vigilant.

269
00:22:48,501 --> 00:22:52,269
These days, the penalties for
even the most honest of errors

270
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:53,471
can be devastating.

271
00:22:53,473 --> 00:22:57,541
You need a sharp, young eye
to catch that stuff.

272
00:22:57,543 --> 00:23:00,511
I mean, when you've specialized
in this kind of work

273
00:23:00,513 --> 00:23:05,049
for decades on end,
you tend to get kind of...

274
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:08,052
Stale. Stale. You get stale.

275
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:09,086
You forget things like,

276
00:23:09,088 --> 00:23:11,222
I don't know, the
Community Reinvestment Act.

277
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:15,459
Any bank such as Mesa Verde
looking to open a de novo branch

278
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:17,828
is definitely
going to need to show

279
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:20,598
a healthy portfolio
of CRA compliance.

280
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,666
Duh.  Obviously.

281
00:23:22,668 --> 00:23:25,002
You guys have all that
covered, I'm sure.

282
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:28,873
Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking
and Branching Efficiency Act.

283
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:31,742
There's another mouthful.

284
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:33,344
Boring!

285
00:23:33,346 --> 00:23:34,745
Still, if you were
to run afoul of it,

286
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:37,248
it could hold you up
in court for years.

287
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,349
And by the way,

288
00:23:38,351 --> 00:23:43,220
if that were to happen to you folks,
as you go forward without us,

289
00:23:43,222 --> 00:23:43,854
which it will not,

290
00:23:43,856 --> 00:23:48,392
um, Howard has contacts at the Fed
who could help sort things out.

291
00:23:48,394 --> 00:23:49,527
One or two. -

292
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:54,298
Then there's the SEC's interpretation
of Section 302 of Sarbox.

293
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,166
Blah, blah, blah.

294
00:23:55,168 --> 00:23:58,536
Well, navigating that
correctly could mean savings

295
00:23:58,538 --> 00:24:00,538
of several hundred
thousand dollars.

296
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,673
They know that, Howard.

297
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:03,607
I apologize.

298
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:05,509
When you reach
your golden years,

299
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:07,545
you tend to get
a little long-winded.

300
00:24:07,547 --> 00:24:09,213
Ramble on and on about details.

301
00:24:09,215 --> 00:24:14,852
My point being, your bank
is in excellent hands.

302
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:25,329
Look, I take your point. I do.

303
00:24:25,331 --> 00:24:30,100
But I have to say, I have complete
confidence in Ms. Wexler.

304
00:24:30,102 --> 00:24:31,035
You should.

305
00:24:31,037 --> 00:24:34,271
She was part of our team.
She learned from us.

306
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:36,807
You won't find
better than Kim Wexler.

307
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:40,244
But no matter how talented
one individual may be,

308
00:24:40,246 --> 00:24:43,347
the needs of Mesa Verde
are too big to handle alone.

309
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:45,850
I wouldn't handle
your coming expansion alone.

310
00:24:45,852 --> 00:24:50,254
Which is why you should
consider, once again,

311
00:24:50,256 --> 00:24:53,757
enlisting a team
of professionals.

312
00:24:56,429 --> 00:24:57,962
Glad we did this.

313
00:24:57,964 --> 00:24:58,762
Anytime.

314
00:24:58,764 --> 00:25:00,865
We are there for you,
day and night.

315
00:25:00,867 --> 00:25:02,199
Lovely to meet you, Paige.

316
00:25:02,201 --> 00:25:03,868
And you. Thank you.

317
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:06,203
Talk soon, gentlemen.

318
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:13,511
Chuck, that...

319
00:25:14,413 --> 00:25:17,848
That was amazing!
Fantastic. Truly...

320
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,750
Whoa. Chuck?

321
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:21,652
Get me home.

322
00:25:21,654 --> 00:25:24,154
Ernie! Hang on.

323
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,400
Again, we want to
thank you for

324
00:25:36,402 --> 00:25:38,603
accommodating
the Major like this.

325
00:25:38,604 --> 00:25:39,637
You kidding? It's an honor.

326
00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:43,641
For a war hero, I think we can
bend the rules a wee bit.

327
00:25:43,643 --> 00:25:44,708
Well, we really
appreciate it.

328
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:47,411
Major Talbott's grandsons are
only in town for one more day,

329
00:25:47,413 --> 00:25:51,415
so it's great they get to share
this experience with him.

330
00:25:51,417 --> 00:25:54,184
You guys are in
for a real treat.

331
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:55,085
You excited?

332
00:25:55,087 --> 00:25:57,755
Yeah, yeah, excited.

333
00:25:57,857 --> 00:25:58,789
So, these are your boys?

334
00:25:58,791 --> 00:26:01,425
No, no,
I'm the family attorney.

335
00:26:01,427 --> 00:26:03,827
I just help when I can,
so I called you.

336
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:07,298
Well, I am glad
to be of service.

337
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:09,767
And here she is.

338
00:26:09,835 --> 00:26:11,335
Gentlemen, meet <i> FIFI.</i>

339
00:26:11,337 --> 00:26:14,705
The world's last airworthy
B-29 Superfortress.

340
00:26:14,707 --> 00:26:17,308
She's based in Texas, but
she's here for a quick visit.

341
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:20,044
Just kind of a morale builder
for the airmen.

342
00:26:20,046 --> 00:26:21,111
The crew's on lunch,
unfortunately.

343
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:24,148
Otherwise, I was gonna see
about showing you inside.

344
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:28,018
Isn't she a beauty, Fudge? Just
like the one you used to fly!

345
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,086
Yep.

346
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:31,188
Major Theodore "Fudge" Talbott.

347
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:35,092
His mom used to mail him care
packages of fudge during the war,

348
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:37,194
and he'd share them
with his friends, so...

349
00:26:37,196 --> 00:26:38,796
That's the story. Right, guys?

350
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:39,296
Yes.

351
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:42,900
Well, sir, this certainly must
bring back some memories for you.

352
00:26:45,705 --> 00:26:47,237
Too many to count, he says.

353
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:49,673
I've got to say, Major Talbott.

354
00:26:49,675 --> 00:26:53,077
It's a privilege. So, thank
you for your service.

355
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:03,721
He says "You're welcome."

356
00:27:03,723 --> 00:27:05,990
Um...

357
00:27:05,992 --> 00:27:07,691
Boy, I envy you guys.

358
00:27:07,693 --> 00:27:09,493
I mean, the stories
you must have heard.

359
00:27:09,495 --> 00:27:11,261
You remember any good ones?

360
00:27:11,263 --> 00:27:12,596
Bombing stuff. Bombing stuff.

361
00:27:12,598 --> 00:27:14,298
That's... Like...

362
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:14,965
Like the war.

363
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:17,635
Did he fly over the Hump or
did he take off out of India?

364
00:27:17,637 --> 00:27:18,869
I think...

365
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:21,739
You doing okay?
You need some water?

366
00:27:21,741 --> 00:27:24,341
Yes. Yes, sir.

367
00:27:25,645 --> 00:27:27,344
Nuts, I forgot his water.

368
00:27:27,346 --> 00:27:27,745
Hey.

369
00:27:27,747 --> 00:27:29,880
I can run back to the office,
get him a bottle.

370
00:27:29,882 --> 00:27:30,581
You could?

371
00:27:30,583 --> 00:27:32,850
Fudge, the captain's gonna
run back to his office.

372
00:27:32,852 --> 00:27:35,653
Get you some water. Okay, sir?

373
00:27:35,655 --> 00:27:37,921
All right. That's great.
And there's no rush.

374
00:27:37,923 --> 00:27:38,922
He's gonna be fine.

375
00:27:38,924 --> 00:27:41,225
I'll be back ASAP.

376
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:47,364
Up. Up.

377
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:50,334
I thought I told you
not to say anything.

378
00:27:50,536 --> 00:27:52,536
Go stand by the front.

379
00:27:52,538 --> 00:27:53,504
The nose! Whatever.

380
00:27:53,506 --> 00:27:54,872
Where the hell did
you find this guy?

381
00:27:54,874 --> 00:27:55,873
You couldn't get
a real war hero?

382
00:27:55,875 --> 00:27:57,675
Yeah, like they grow on trees!

383
00:27:57,677 --> 00:27:58,409
This guy owes me.

384
00:27:58,411 --> 00:28:00,878
I defended him a while back
when he couldn't pay.

385
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,612
Defended him for what?

386
00:28:01,614 --> 00:28:04,214
What, you wanna be a lawyer
when you grow up?

387
00:28:04,216 --> 00:28:05,215
Just fix the...

388
00:28:05,217 --> 00:28:07,051
Public masturbation.

389
00:28:07,053 --> 00:28:07,985
Total bullshit!

390
00:28:07,987 --> 00:28:09,720
All right.
Keep your voice down.

391
00:28:09,722 --> 00:28:12,122
You do not possess
the power of speech.

392
00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:14,725
Okay, let's go!
Let's go! Chop-chop!

393
00:28:14,727 --> 00:28:15,559
All right, hands on your hips.

394
00:28:15,561 --> 00:28:19,530
All right. Looking strong,
looking proud. All right.

395
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:20,364
See the bomber, okay?

396
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:22,399
The bomber's the main point,
so see it.

397
00:28:22,401 --> 00:28:23,167
I see the freaking bomber.

398
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:25,102
Couldn't you just pop the dude
in front of a flag?

399
00:28:25,104 --> 00:28:27,037
Why'd we have to come here?

400
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,573
Production value. Showmanship!

401
00:28:29,575 --> 00:28:31,375
You rolling? Yeah, rolling!

402
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:34,011
Okay, start the dolly.

403
00:28:34,647 --> 00:28:36,213
Action!

404
00:28:37,983 --> 00:28:40,684
You're part of
the greatest generation!

405
00:28:40,853 --> 00:28:42,820
You fought the Nazis!

406
00:28:42,822 --> 00:28:44,788
Fought the Japanese.

407
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,824
Fought Japanese.

408
00:28:46,826 --> 00:28:48,192
I fought the Japanese.

409
00:28:48,194 --> 00:28:53,564
This machine was used in the
Pacific where the Japanese are.

410
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:57,367
Why don't you shut up and
learn to take some direction?

411
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:00,337
Japanese.

412
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:01,839
All right, fine.

413
00:29:01,841 --> 00:29:05,008
You fought all
the dirty Axis Powers.

414
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:09,680
Your band of brothers came
together and you saved the world!

415
00:29:09,682 --> 00:29:10,681
You're heroic!

416
00:29:10,683 --> 00:29:14,518
Not that heroic. Just throw
it away a little more.

417
00:29:15,054 --> 00:29:15,652
Okay, good.

418
00:29:15,654 --> 00:29:17,387
You've got red, white, and blue
coursing through your veins.

419
00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:21,291
Look up! Picture a
bald eagle, soaring!

420
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:23,327
Shit.

421
00:29:23,329 --> 00:29:24,428
Okay, just keep rolling.

422
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,897
Tights, wides, just get me
some good angles.

423
00:29:26,899 --> 00:29:28,599
All right, back to one.
Back to one.

424
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:31,168
Fudge.
Fudge. Right here. Fudge.

425
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:31,802
What is it, Ernie?

426
00:29:31,804 --> 00:29:35,372
<i> Jimmy, man, I'm at
your brother's and he's bad.</i>

427
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:36,106
Bad, how bad?

428
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:38,542
He's... I don't know. Bad. Shaking.
I've never seen him like this.

429
00:29:38,544 --> 00:29:40,177
He keeps telling me
not to call a doctor.

430
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:42,179
Let me guess. He's been
going in to the office?

431
00:29:42,181 --> 00:29:46,283
<i>Yeah, more and more. He had
a big meeting there today.</i>

432
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:50,220
Okay, here's what you're gonna do.
Wrap him in a space blanket.

433
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:51,588
<i>He's already under one.</i>

434
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,356
Wrap him in a second one.

435
00:29:52,358 --> 00:29:56,560
Make him some tea, or just
better, heat some chicken broth.

436
00:29:56,562 --> 00:29:58,962
<i>Just let it simmer,</i>
<i>don't make it boil.</i>

437
00:29:58,964 --> 00:29:59,997
That's it? No doctor?

438
00:29:59,999 --> 00:30:03,634
That's it. No doctor. He's
just got to ride this out.

439
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:05,335
Chuck'll be fine.

440
00:30:05,337 --> 00:30:07,371
Shit, I gotta go.

441
00:30:08,174 --> 00:30:09,239
Rhubarb! Rhubarb!

442
00:30:09,241 --> 00:30:11,708
Idiots, that's the signal!
Get him in the chair!

443
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:15,512
Where's the air hose?
Stick it in your nose.

444
00:30:17,082 --> 00:30:18,549
Come on.

445
00:30:22,354 --> 00:30:22,886
Sir!

446
00:30:22,888 --> 00:30:24,688
Hey! This is not a problem.

447
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:27,658
Do you mind if the guys and I
took a picture with you?

448
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,725
It would mean a lot to us.

449
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:31,261
Yeah, pictures.
He loves pictures.

450
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:33,063
Here. Give me the camera.
Yeah, here's your water.

451
00:30:33,065 --> 00:30:35,599
Thank you so much. Thank you.

452
00:30:35,601 --> 00:30:39,403
Here. All right!
Let's scoot you in.

453
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:40,971
Swing ya around.

454
00:30:40,973 --> 00:30:43,473
Okay. Everybody line up!

455
00:30:45,644 --> 00:30:46,810
Smile!

456
00:30:46,812 --> 00:30:48,512
Cheese!

457
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:15,372
You ready to sign?
Let's do this!

458
00:31:17,643 --> 00:31:19,109
What?

459
00:31:22,348 --> 00:31:24,514
I lost Mesa Verde.

460
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:26,817
What?

461
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:28,852
I had him.

462
00:31:30,256 --> 00:31:32,256
I thought I had him.

463
00:31:32,258 --> 00:31:34,258
So, what happened?

464
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,894
They're sticking with HHM.

465
00:31:37,162 --> 00:31:38,595
Paige said they went over there

466
00:31:38,597 --> 00:31:41,164
this afternoon for some kind of

467
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:43,667
courtesy meeting,
or so she thought.

468
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:45,535
And Kevin got his head turned.

469
00:31:45,971 --> 00:31:47,404
By Howard?

470
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:48,906
No.

471
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:51,975
Chuck.

472
00:32:03,956 --> 00:32:06,223
Jimmy, I have to ask...

473
00:32:08,827 --> 00:32:11,461
Are you still up
for doing this?

474
00:32:12,064 --> 00:32:14,331
What, you mean
getting the office?

475
00:32:15,668 --> 00:32:18,535
All of it. I think...

476
00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:23,874
Maybe we need to slow down
and really, you know,

477
00:32:24,777 --> 00:32:25,642
think about this.

478
00:32:25,644 --> 00:32:27,511
Wait. Whoa. Nothing's changed.

479
00:32:27,513 --> 00:32:28,211
Nothing's changed?

480
00:32:28,213 --> 00:32:30,380
We're about to sign
a very expensive lease

481
00:32:30,382 --> 00:32:32,649
after a very
sizable chunk of income

482
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:34,484
just went flying
out the window.

483
00:32:34,486 --> 00:32:37,254
That's why we're a team.

484
00:32:37,256 --> 00:32:38,622
Something like this happens,

485
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:42,693
you're there to help me,
I'm there to help you.

486
00:32:42,928 --> 00:32:47,397
Hey. There will be
other Mesa Verdes.

487
00:32:50,903 --> 00:32:54,604
So, you still want to do this?

488
00:36:03,595 --> 00:36:04,394
Jimmy.

489
00:36:04,396 --> 00:36:07,664
I did everything you said, but
he's not getting any better.

490
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:08,331
You did good, Ernie.

491
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:12,536
Thanks. Why don't you go
home and get some sleep.

492
00:36:12,538 --> 00:36:14,371
I'll take over.

493
00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:17,107
He told me he
wanted me to stay.

494
00:36:17,109 --> 00:36:18,575
It's okay. I'm here now.

495
00:36:18,577 --> 00:36:22,913
And next time you see Howard,
tell him you need a raise.

496
00:36:22,915 --> 00:36:24,381
A big one.

497
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:32,789
Chuck, buddy?

498
00:36:34,293 --> 00:36:36,226
How you feeling?

499
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,246
Hey, how's it going?

500
00:38:03,248 --> 00:38:06,016
I need an X-Acto knife,
a ruler, wood, please.

501
00:38:06,018 --> 00:38:10,620
Hammermill Premium paper, 20lb,
one ream, and a glue stick.

502
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:12,689
And point me to
your best copier.

503
00:38:12,691 --> 00:38:14,524
Best copier? Yeah, best copier.

504
00:38:14,526 --> 00:38:16,693

00:41:57,148 --> 00:41:58,815
Good afternoon.

527
00:42:00,919 --> 00:42:02,752
Is it afternoon?

528
00:42:04,322 --> 00:42:08,124
Where's Ernesto? He was
supposed to stay with me.

529
00:42:08,126 --> 00:42:09,425
Don't get mad at Ernie.

530
00:42:09,427 --> 00:42:10,693
He spent
the better part of a day

531
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:13,796
watching you do your
impression of a baked potato.

532
00:42:13,798 --> 00:42:17,300
I told him to go home,
get some shut-eye.

533
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:18,935
You hungry?

534
00:42:18,937 --> 00:42:22,105
You want something
besides crackers?

535
00:42:22,407 --> 00:42:24,440
No, I'm fine.

536
00:42:29,414 --> 00:42:31,848
I'll fix myself something.

537
00:42:31,983 --> 00:42:33,583
After my stomach settles.

538
00:42:33,585 --> 00:42:36,286
You're really doing
a number on yourself,

539
00:42:36,288 --> 00:42:40,223
spending so much time
out of the house.

540
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:42,792
You just had to do it?

541
00:42:42,794 --> 00:42:45,061
Couldn't stand to let
Kim have Mesa Verde.

542
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:46,462
You had to swipe it from her.

543
00:42:46,464 --> 00:42:47,897
I didn't swipe anything.

544
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:48,932
We retained our client.

545
00:42:48,934 --> 00:42:51,668
You and Howard never even
heard about Mesa Verde

546
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:56,172
till Kim brought it to you
on a red velvet pillow.

547
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:03,846
I need a shower. And I've
got a ton of work to do.

548
00:43:03,848 --> 00:43:05,248
So, if you're
looking for a fight,

549
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:08,518
Jimmy,
I just don't have it in me.

550
00:43:14,826 --> 00:43:16,593
Jimmy.

551
00:43:17,562 --> 00:43:20,096
Thanks for staying with me.

552
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:23,366
I know we have our issues.

553
00:43:23,368 --> 00:43:27,003
But if things were reversed,

554
00:43:27,572 --> 00:43:31,407
I hope you know that
I would do the same for you.

555
00:43:57,135 --> 00:44:01,804
You're doing a great job.
You done this before?

556
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:03,673
No. Not like this.

557
00:44:03,675 --> 00:44:06,876
But we learned about
fractions in school.

558
00:44:06,878 --> 00:44:09,245
You did? What fractions?

559
00:44:09,247 --> 00:44:14,851
Half inch, quarter inch,
eighth inch, sixteenth inch.

560
00:44:14,853 --> 00:44:16,419
Wow.

561
00:44:16,421 --> 00:44:17,353
You know, I got to tell you.

562
00:44:17,355 --> 00:44:21,224
You are much smarter than I
was when I was your age.

563
00:44:21,226 --> 00:44:24,994
Maybe you needed
better teachers.

564
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:27,630
That could be.

565
00:44:27,632 --> 00:44:29,365
Can I do the drill now?

566
00:44:29,367 --> 00:44:30,933
You promised.

567
00:44:32,871 --> 00:44:34,837
I did, didn't I?

568
00:44:36,207 --> 00:44:38,274
Okay. Get up here.

569
00:44:39,277 --> 00:44:40,610
Now, you're gonna
have to wear these

570
00:44:40,612 --> 00:44:43,112
if you're gonna handle
the heavy machinery.

571
00:44:43,114 --> 00:44:45,281
Why don't you
have to wear them?

572
00:44:45,283 --> 00:44:46,649
Because Pop-Pop's a grown-up.

573
00:44:46,651 --> 00:44:52,021
And grown-ups get to be stupid.
Now, put them on.

574
00:44:52,357 --> 00:44:52,855
All right.

575
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:55,992
Now, I'm gonna hold this
because it's heavy.

576
00:44:55,994 --> 00:44:59,429
But you pull the trigger
when I say so. Okay?

577
00:44:59,431 --> 00:45:01,731
Now, get your hand on it.

578
00:45:01,733 --> 00:45:03,433
All right, you got it?

579
00:45:03,768 --> 00:45:04,600
Ready.

580
00:45:04,602 --> 00:45:07,704
All right. Ready, set,

581
00:45:07,706 --> 00:45:08,638
pull.

582
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:12,709
Good job.

583
00:45:12,711 --> 00:45:14,610
Can we do more? -

584
00:45:14,612 --> 00:45:17,246
You line 'em up for me.

585
00:45:17,248 --> 00:45:18,815
Hello?

586
00:45:18,817 --> 00:45:20,616
We're back here!

587
00:45:24,756 --> 00:45:26,389
Wow! What's all this?

588
00:45:26,391 --> 00:45:28,691
We're making
a special hose!

589
00:45:28,693 --> 00:45:31,594
Yeah, that's
a special hose, all right.

590
00:45:31,596 --> 00:45:33,963
I made marks
every three-quarter inch.

591
00:45:33,965 --> 00:45:35,965
Then Pop-Pop put
a piece of wood down,

592
00:45:35,967 --> 00:45:37,300
so he doesn't ruin his table.

593
00:45:37,302 --> 00:45:41,604
Then we line up a drill
and put the hole in the "X".

594
00:45:43,174 --> 00:45:43,506
Wow!

595
00:45:43,508 --> 00:45:47,443
I needed a soaker for the
rhododendrons out back.

596
00:45:47,445 --> 00:45:50,813
Well, Pop-Pop is gonna have to
finish this project on his own,

597
00:45:50,815 --> 00:45:51,914
because we have to go!

598
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:53,950
But we're not done yet.

599
00:45:53,952 --> 00:45:54,751
No, I'll finish up.

600
00:45:54,753 --> 00:45:59,355
But you, young lady,
were a big help.

601
00:45:59,758 --> 00:46:01,290
Give me a hug.

602
00:46:03,428 --> 00:46:06,095
Ooh. Love you, girl.

603
00:46:07,232 --> 00:46:08,464
Love you.

604
00:46:08,466 --> 00:46:09,365
Thanks, Mike.

605
00:46:09,367 --> 00:46:11,033
You still good for Friday?
Absolutely.

606
00:46:11,035 --> 00:46:13,469
I'll think of
another project by then.

607
00:46:13,471 --> 00:46:15,004
Fantastic.

608
00:46:15,006 --> 00:46:17,073
Bye. Bye.

609
00:46:48,873 --> 00:46:50,840
<i>I have a lunch date already.</i>
<i>Well, break it.</i>

610
00:46:50,842 --> 00:46:52,441
<i>I cannot break it.</i>
<i>Certainly you can, come on.</i>

611
00:46:52,443 --> 00:46:53,843
<i>Will you take</i>
<i>your hands off me?</i>

612
00:46:53,845 --> 00:46:55,211
<i>What are you playing,</i>
<i>osteopath?</i>

613
00:46:55,213 --> 00:46:55,978
<i>All right, temper...</i>

614
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:58,181
<i>Listen, Walt. You are no longer</i>

615
00:46:58,183 --> 00:47:00,216
<i>my husband and</i>
<i>no longer my boss!</i>

616
00:47:00,218 --> 00:47:02,652
<i>And you're not</i>
<i>going to be my boss.</i>

617
00:47:02,654 --> 00:47:03,820
<i> Well,</i>
<i>it would have worked out</i>

618
00:47:03,822 --> 00:47:06,556
<i>if you'd been satisfied with
just being editor and reporter.</i>

619
00:47:06,558 --> 00:47:08,658
<i>But not you! You had to</i>
<i>marry me, spoil everything!</i>

620
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:12,061
<i> I wasn't satisfied.</i>
<i>I suppose I proposed to you!</i>

621
00:47:12,063 --> 00:47:13,229
<i> Well,</i>
<i>you practically did.</i>

622
00:47:13,231 --> 00:47:15,698
<i>Making goo-goo eyes at me for
two years until I broke down.</i>

623
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:16,432
<i>"Walter!"</i>

624
00:47:16,434 --> 00:47:19,068
<i>And I still claim I was tight</i>
<i>the night I proposed to you.</i>

625
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:20,369
<i>If you'd been</i>
<i>a gentleman you'd have</i>

626
00:47:20,371 --> 00:47:21,504
<i>forgotten all about it.</i>
<i>But not you!</i>

627
00:47:21,506 --> 00:47:22,772
<i> Why, you...</i>
<i>You're losing your eye.</i>

628
00:47:22,774 --> 00:47:24,674
<i> You used to be able</i>
<i>to pitch better than that.</i>

629
00:47:24,676 --> 00:47:26,676
<i>Hello. Yeah. What?</i>

630
00:47:26,678 --> 00:47:29,612
<i>Sweeney?</i>
<i>Well, what can I do for you?</i>
