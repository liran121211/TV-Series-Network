1
00:00:59,268 --> 00:00:59,934
Wonderful.

2
00:00:59,936 --> 00:01:01,403
Are the leeks too overpowering?

3
00:01:01,505 --> 00:01:02,337
Not at all.

4
00:01:02,339 --> 00:01:04,406
That's as good as
the one we had in Florence.

5
00:01:04,508 --> 00:01:05,476
Don't humor me.

6
00:01:05,576 --> 00:01:06,676
I'm not.

7
00:01:07,511 --> 00:01:09,111
How was rehearsal?

8
00:01:09,513 --> 00:01:11,079
Did what's her name
behave herself?

9
00:01:11,081 --> 00:01:12,847
She takes the whole
section for granted.

10
00:01:12,849 --> 00:01:14,883
I'm debating
whether to say something.

11
00:01:14,885 --> 00:01:17,019
I think you should, absolutely.

12
00:01:17,021 --> 00:01:18,854
Don't keep it inside.

13
00:01:19,056 --> 00:01:20,068
Ready for the chiffonade?

14
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,424
Yeah, thanks.

15
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:26,361
And after all, if she's
compromising the work...

16
00:01:26,363 --> 00:01:30,722
Well, it's debatable. I mean, the
Schubert is coming along nicely.

17
00:01:30,734 --> 00:01:33,301
It's more about morale.

18
00:01:33,703 --> 00:01:35,203
Morale can affect quality.

19
00:01:35,605 --> 00:01:38,306
God knows the hoops that
Howard jumps through

20
00:01:38,308 --> 00:01:39,600
just to keep the troops humming.

21
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,543
Well, true.

22
00:01:45,748 --> 00:01:47,248
You deserve a medal for this.

23
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,151
Please. It's no big deal.

24
00:01:52,889 --> 00:01:54,289
Your soy ginger marinade?

25
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:56,524
Well, I found a citrus
one that looked good,

26
00:01:56,526 --> 00:01:58,627
so I thought I would try that.

27
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:01,963
Well, anyway, you are a trouper.

28
00:02:02,065 --> 00:02:03,331
And I apologize in advance.

29
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:07,869
Let's just say he's something
of an acquired taste.

30
00:02:08,071 --> 00:02:09,704
Oh, how bad can he be?

31
00:02:09,706 --> 00:02:12,140
Just in case,
let's have a high sign.

32
00:02:12,843 --> 00:02:14,743
How about the old
Carol Burnett thing?

33
00:02:14,745 --> 00:02:16,378
Oh, where she pulls her earlobe?

34
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,146
Yeah, exactly.

35
00:02:18,148 --> 00:02:18,813
You do this,

36
00:02:18,815 --> 00:02:21,649
and I'll say I have briefs to read,
and we'll get rid of him.

37
00:02:21,651 --> 00:02:23,651
All right,
whatever you want.

38
00:02:23,653 --> 00:02:26,921
- You know why she did that? Carol Burnett?
- Hmm?

39
00:02:26,923 --> 00:02:28,890
It's a great story. It was
a signal to her grandmother,

40
00:02:28,892 --> 00:02:32,026
who raised her, and...

41
00:02:32,128 --> 00:02:35,296
Seriously? He's early.

42
00:02:35,298 --> 00:02:37,198
You're a doll. Hmm.

43
00:02:40,269 --> 00:02:41,970
Holy shit, look at this place!

44
00:02:41,972 --> 00:02:43,538
Hey, Jimmy. Thanks for coming.

45
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:47,008
Bring it on in here.

46
00:02:47,176 --> 00:02:47,609
Oh, yeah.

47
00:02:47,611 --> 00:02:49,677
Hey, little taste
of home for you.

48
00:02:49,679 --> 00:02:53,481
Had to look all over town
to find a place that had it.

49
00:02:53,483 --> 00:02:55,417
Didn't have time to wrap it.

50
00:02:55,419 --> 00:02:57,118
Well, thanks.

51
00:03:02,658 --> 00:03:04,125
You're good.

52
00:03:04,293 --> 00:03:06,161
Yeah.

53
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,497
I'm lookin' for a place.
Mmm.. mmm.

54
00:03:09,499 --> 00:03:10,498
I've been staying at the Ramada.

55
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,601
Thanks for the help, by the way,
I found a few that I like.

56
00:03:13,603 --> 00:03:16,070
This one place,
the Beachcomber, has a pool.

57
00:03:16,072 --> 00:03:19,240
And since the McGill clan is whiter
than a pack of albino rats,

58
00:03:19,242 --> 00:03:22,210
I figure I'd better
start working on my tan.

59
00:03:22,212 --> 00:03:24,245
So, seriously
considering that option.

60
00:03:24,247 --> 00:03:26,714
I strongly suggest sunscreen.

61
00:03:26,716 --> 00:03:30,151
We're up about 5,000
feet here, you'll fry.

62
00:03:30,153 --> 00:03:32,754
Excellent point. Sunscreen.

63
00:03:32,955 --> 00:03:34,322
Check.

64
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,528
So, a violinist?

65
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:40,995
Mmm.

66
00:03:40,997 --> 00:03:45,400
And, according to Chuck,
a crazy talented one at that.

67
00:03:45,402 --> 00:03:46,468
Mmm.

68
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,769
I mean, wow.

69
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:50,305
Well, Chuck is very gracious.

70
00:03:50,307 --> 00:03:51,439
She's being modest.

71
00:03:51,441 --> 00:03:54,642
Rebecca is widely respected
amongst her peers.

72
00:03:54,644 --> 00:03:57,445
Yo-Yo Ma came to our wedding.

73
00:03:57,646 --> 00:04:01,182
That's... Right on, man.

74
00:04:01,852 --> 00:04:07,889
About the wedding, um, I've been
meaning to apologize about that.

75
00:04:07,891 --> 00:04:10,325
I'm truly sorry I wasn't...

76
00:04:10,327 --> 00:04:11,960
No worries.

77
00:04:11,962 --> 00:04:13,595
Please.

78
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,233
So, tell us about your first

79
00:04:18,235 --> 00:04:20,502
week at Hamlin Hamlin & McGill.

80
00:04:20,504 --> 00:04:21,135
It was great!

81
00:04:21,137 --> 00:04:24,272
I mean, they got me
working in the mailroom,

82
00:04:24,274 --> 00:04:26,875
which, you gotta
start somewhere.

83
00:04:26,877 --> 00:04:28,610
I learned how to
use the Xerox machine,

84
00:04:28,612 --> 00:04:29,878
which is
surprisingly complicated.

85
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,582
I mean, press a button, piece of
paper spits out? Not anymore.

86
00:04:34,584 --> 00:04:36,718
- Hmm.
- Thing's practically a computer.

87
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,653
It's like
a goddamn space shuttle.

88
00:04:38,655 --> 00:04:41,122
It's got like,
double sided printing,

89
00:04:41,124 --> 00:04:43,658
automatic stapling,
you know? Hmm.

90
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:48,530
Met some nice folks.
Guys and gals.

91
00:04:48,532 --> 00:04:51,799
Well, gal, singular, actually.

92
00:04:51,801 --> 00:04:55,436
Learned everyone's name
and I licked a ton of stamps.

93
00:04:55,438 --> 00:05:00,208
My tongue is like hamburger meat.
I mean, seriously.

94
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,809
Unh...

95
00:05:01,811 --> 00:05:02,410
Yeah?

96
00:05:02,412 --> 00:05:04,379
I got...
The thing is raw as hell.

97
00:05:04,381 --> 00:05:09,817
Then I found out there's a sponge for that.
Oops, rookie mistake.

98
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:12,954
Well, sounds like you had
a very productive week.

99
00:05:12,956 --> 00:05:15,456
Yeah! It was really great.

100
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:20,862
Hey, guys, um,

101
00:05:21,297 --> 00:05:23,364
I wanna thank you
for having me over.

102
00:05:23,366 --> 00:05:27,936
This is, like, the best meal
I've had in a decade.

103
00:05:28,438 --> 00:05:31,940
I mean, the fish is
perfection. And the...

104
00:05:32,107 --> 00:05:33,575
Risotto.

105
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:34,842
Risotto.

106
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:37,712
Thank you. That was very kind.

107
00:05:37,714 --> 00:05:40,148
Well, you're a wonderful chef,
you know?

108
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:43,585
Aside from being super
talented with the... Yeah.

109
00:05:43,587 --> 00:05:48,323
You got a good one, Chuck.
I mean, lucky, lucky man.

110
00:05:48,325 --> 00:05:50,258
Well, cheers to that.

111
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,526
Oh.

112
00:05:57,534 --> 00:05:59,534
Pardon me.

113
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:13,247
All right.

114
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,684
What's the difference
between a vacuum cleaner

115
00:06:16,686 --> 00:06:18,553
and a lawyer on a motorcycle?

116
00:06:18,555 --> 00:06:22,590
The vacuum cleaner has
the dirt bag on the inside!

117
00:06:23,893 --> 00:06:24,525
Aha, lawyer jokes.

118
00:06:24,527 --> 00:06:27,495
I've only been in the mailroom a
week, and I've heard maybe 100.

119
00:06:27,497 --> 00:06:30,331
Yeah. It all comes from
a place of affection.

120
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:30,932
Sure, of course.

121
00:06:30,934 --> 00:06:34,369
What do you get when you cross
The Godfather with a lawyer?

122
00:06:34,371 --> 00:06:37,572
An offer you can't understand.

123
00:06:37,574 --> 00:06:38,673
Very clever.
Never heard that one.

124
00:06:38,675 --> 00:06:43,578
And believe me, I have nothing but the
utmost respect for your profession.

125
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,445
I mean, it's a pillar of...

126
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:47,548
Oh, why do they bury lawyers
under 20 feet of dirt?

127
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,485
Because deep down,
they're really good people.

128
00:06:51,521 --> 00:06:54,389
What do you call
a lawyer with an IQ of 60?

129
00:06:54,391 --> 00:06:55,590
Your Honor!

130
00:06:55,592 --> 00:06:58,526
What's the difference
between a tick and a lawyer?

131
00:06:58,528 --> 00:06:59,227
Oh, no.

132
00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:00,795
The tick falls off
when you're dead!

133
00:07:00,797 --> 00:07:02,497
Bam! Love that one.

134
00:07:02,499 --> 00:07:03,331
You like that?

135
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:08,503
Just joking. I want you to know
how seriously I take my job.

136
00:07:08,505 --> 00:07:10,672
I'm grateful for the... Oh.

137
00:07:10,674 --> 00:07:13,608
How many lawyers does it take
to change a light bulb?

138
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:14,442
Classic set up here.

139
00:07:14,444 --> 00:07:18,813
Three. One to climb the ladder,
one to shake it,

140
00:07:18,815 --> 00:07:21,015
and one to sue
the ladder company!

141
00:07:22,585 --> 00:07:23,985
Comedy gold.

142
00:07:23,987 --> 00:07:25,086
I'm here all night!

143
00:07:25,088 --> 00:07:26,587
More! Go, go.

144
00:07:26,589 --> 00:07:28,589
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

145
00:07:28,591 --> 00:07:29,323
Dessert, anyone?

146
00:07:29,325 --> 00:07:32,427
We have a homemade blueberry
crumble with vanilla ice cream.

147
00:07:32,429 --> 00:07:34,929
Yeah. Blueberry crumble,
sounds terrific.

148
00:07:34,931 --> 00:07:36,597
I love a fruit based...
Blueberry...

149
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:37,832
Wait, I think I know one!

150
00:07:37,834 --> 00:07:39,300
Oh, bring it on! Yeah, yeah.

151
00:07:39,302 --> 00:07:43,037
Um, what do lawyers
and sperm have in common?

152
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,806
Oh, that's a... Um.

153
00:07:44,808 --> 00:07:46,107
Three million...

154
00:07:46,109 --> 00:07:49,110
No, wait, um,
one in three million...

155
00:07:49,112 --> 00:07:51,846
Have a chance of
becoming a human being.

156
00:07:55,384 --> 00:07:56,584
Love that one!

157
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,695
Well, that went well,
don't you think?

158
00:08:06,697 --> 00:08:08,363
Sure.

159
00:08:08,365 --> 00:08:10,531
Thanks again.

160
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,569
I don't know what you were
worried about. Jimmy's great.

161
00:08:14,571 --> 00:08:18,039
Yeah. No, he's...

162
00:08:18,274 --> 00:08:20,041
Yeah.

163
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:23,711
So, what's going on
tomorrow?

164
00:08:23,713 --> 00:08:26,748
Well, I've got the Gernstetter
deposition at 10:00,

165
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:32,086
back to back partner meetings after lunch.
It shouldn't be a late one.

166
00:08:32,287 --> 00:08:34,188
Thought any more
about what's her name?

167
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,724
It's your reputation,
too, you know?

168
00:08:36,726 --> 00:08:38,793
Well, we start
the Tchaikovsky on Monday,

169
00:08:38,795 --> 00:08:42,700
so, I'll see what kind of mood
she's in when we wrap.

170
00:08:42,732 --> 00:08:44,599
Smart.

171
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:55,510
What do you call 25 attorneys
buried up to their chins in cement?

172
00:08:55,845 --> 00:08:57,645
Not enough cement.

173
00:08:57,647 --> 00:08:59,046
What?

174
00:09:00,884 --> 00:09:02,683
Oh, oh, oh.

175
00:09:04,853 --> 00:09:06,754
Yeah. Mmm.

176
00:09:54,971 --> 00:09:57,138
<i>Hello, you've reached
the voicemail of Kim Wexler.</i>

177
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:00,741
<i>Please leave me a message, and I'll
get back to you as soon as I can.</i>

178
00:10:00,743 --> 00:10:01,642
It's me again.

179
00:10:01,644 --> 00:10:05,613
I think I found something that
could help get you out of there.

180
00:10:05,615 --> 00:10:08,049
I'm gonna make things right.

181
00:10:08,051 --> 00:10:10,318
Call me, would you?

182
00:10:29,371 --> 00:10:30,238
Hi. Whoa!

183
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,241
Sorry, I didn't mean
to sneak up on you.

184
00:10:33,243 --> 00:10:35,643
I just thought
everyone was gone.

185
00:10:35,645 --> 00:10:37,912
Nope. I'm here late most nights.

186
00:10:37,914 --> 00:10:39,046
Ah.

187
00:10:39,048 --> 00:10:43,251
By the way,
I noticed in your office,

188
00:10:43,719 --> 00:10:45,653
you threw away a soda can.

189
00:10:45,655 --> 00:10:47,455
You're going through my trash?

190
00:10:47,457 --> 00:10:48,322
No!

191
00:10:48,324 --> 00:10:49,423
I was just dropping off
papers at lunchtime

192
00:10:49,425 --> 00:10:51,759
and I happened to notice
it in your trash can.

193
00:10:51,761 --> 00:10:53,461
I fished it out, so, it's fine.

194
00:10:53,463 --> 00:10:55,696
Office cans are
for recyclable paper.

195
00:10:55,698 --> 00:10:57,198
There's a separate,
big can in the kitchen

196
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,633
for plastic, glass and aluminum.

197
00:10:58,635 --> 00:11:01,669
We take our ecological footprint
pretty seriously here.

198
00:11:01,671 --> 00:11:02,670
Okay, so, the big can

199
00:11:02,672 --> 00:11:05,940
is where I should throw my
empty scotch bottles?

200
00:11:05,942 --> 00:11:08,876
No, I get it.

201
00:11:08,878 --> 00:11:10,111
"Go green."

202
00:11:10,113 --> 00:11:13,281
Good. Was there anything else?

203
00:11:13,283 --> 00:11:13,981
Yeah, one quick thing.

204
00:11:13,983 --> 00:11:15,616
I have the brief you
gave Cliff this morning.

205
00:11:15,618 --> 00:11:18,552
The plaintiff's opposition
to the defendant's motion?

206
00:11:18,554 --> 00:11:19,253
I have a few notes.

207
00:11:19,255 --> 00:11:20,354
I think they're pretty clear,

208
00:11:20,356 --> 00:11:23,591
but it's probably easier if we
just go over them together.

209
00:11:23,593 --> 00:11:25,660
Jesus. Those are Cliff's?

210
00:11:25,662 --> 00:11:26,427
No, they're my notes.

211
00:11:26,429 --> 00:11:28,396
I'd love to go over them now,
if you have a minute.

212
00:11:28,398 --> 00:11:32,333
It looks worse than it is, it's just that
we have a particular house style.

213
00:11:32,335 --> 00:11:36,170
Okay, no offense, but you're a
second year associate, right?

214
00:11:36,172 --> 00:11:36,704
Yep.

215
00:11:36,706 --> 00:11:38,639
And I came in as a fourth year.

216
00:11:38,641 --> 00:11:39,507
That's right.

217
00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:43,611
So, why is a second year
giving notes to a fourth year?

218
00:11:43,613 --> 00:11:47,281
Well, like I said,
I know the house style.

219
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,617
Does Cliff have
you babysitting me?

220
00:11:49,619 --> 00:11:55,489
No! This is just one associate
helping another.

221
00:11:55,491 --> 00:11:58,359
Like here,
the Roman numeral headings?

222
00:11:58,361 --> 00:11:59,327
We use all caps for those.

223
00:11:59,329 --> 00:12:02,530
And you indented them,
which is perfectly fine,

224
00:12:02,532 --> 00:12:04,432
but Cliff likes them centered.

225
00:12:04,434 --> 00:12:05,232
And before I forget,

226
00:12:05,234 --> 00:12:08,002
we put two spaces after a
period on all our documents.

227
00:12:08,004 --> 00:12:09,971
I know it seems
like a minor thing,

228
00:12:09,973 --> 00:12:11,939
but it really looks so much
cleaner on the page.

229
00:12:11,941 --> 00:12:13,874
You went a tad overboard
with the quotations.

230
00:12:13,876 --> 00:12:17,578
It's okay to present a quote from
a controlling legal opinion,

231
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,346
but when you use too many,

232
00:12:18,348 --> 00:12:19,847
it disrupts the flow
of your argument

233
00:12:19,849 --> 00:12:20,915
and it gives the impression
you don't know

234
00:12:20,917 --> 00:12:22,383
how to write
an argument of your own.

235
00:12:22,385 --> 00:12:23,918
And I'm sure you do, so...

236
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,755
You have a tendency to overuse
the words "clearly" and "obviously."

237
00:12:27,757 --> 00:12:29,423
Again, it's a matter
of personal opinion...

238
00:12:29,425 --> 00:12:34,495
I really appreciate this, Erin,
but I was just on my way out.

239
00:12:34,497 --> 00:12:37,365
So, if we could continue this
first thing tomorrow morning.

240
00:12:37,367 --> 00:12:40,668
Well, I was thinking we should
just get 'er done now.

241
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,903
No time like the present!

242
00:12:44,406 --> 00:12:46,874
Sure. Let's roll up our sleeves

243
00:12:46,876 --> 00:12:49,010
and apply a little elbow grease.

244
00:12:49,012 --> 00:12:49,443
Great!

245
00:12:49,445 --> 00:12:51,812
So, I'm gonna get
my favorite pen,

246
00:12:51,814 --> 00:12:54,582
and I will see you momentarily.

247
00:12:54,584 --> 00:12:56,417
You got it.

248
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:47,501
Uh, miss Wexler?

249
00:13:47,669 --> 00:13:49,703
You can call me "Kim".

250
00:13:49,705 --> 00:13:52,940
Kim, it's 20 to midnight.

251
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,745
Are you asking me
if you can leave?

252
00:13:57,747 --> 00:14:02,650
Guys, I'm not your supervisor.
Don't stick around on my account.

253
00:14:10,258 --> 00:14:10,991
You coming, Kim?

254
00:14:10,993 --> 00:14:15,129
Right behind you. Just
finishing up this last one.

255
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:50,658
Hey, again. Thanks.

256
00:15:55,797 --> 00:15:59,466
Hey, Gesualdo, could you skip
vacuuming tonight, please?

257
00:15:59,468 --> 00:16:02,903
Hey. Five minutes.
Just give me five minutes.

258
00:16:02,905 --> 00:16:08,509
Here's how we're gonna handle
this travesty of justice.

259
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:13,881
<i>Wexler v.
Hamlin Hamlin & McGill?</i>

260
00:16:13,883 --> 00:16:16,350
You want me to sue my own firm?

261
00:16:16,352 --> 00:16:18,485
Filing's all typed up,
it's ready to go.

262
00:16:18,487 --> 00:16:20,688
This is not my area of
expertise, all right?

263
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:25,125
So, first order of business, we get a
great employment law attorney,

264
00:16:25,127 --> 00:16:26,827
show 'em we mean business.

265
00:16:27,396 --> 00:16:30,464
Come on. Hey, look at you!

266
00:16:30,466 --> 00:16:31,098
Okay, you're here.

267
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:35,236
At midnight, in this glorified cell
block, busting your ass, for what?

268
00:16:35,238 --> 00:16:38,906
It has nothing to do with your
performance. You're being mistreated.

269
00:16:38,908 --> 00:16:41,842
Chuck is punishing
you to get to me.

270
00:16:41,844 --> 00:16:44,078
This is extortion,
pure and simple.

271
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,880
No, that's Howard,
who has an image to uphold.

272
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:49,183
He did the same thing after
the Kettleman fiasco,

273
00:16:49,185 --> 00:16:51,752
and Chuck was nowhere in sight.

274
00:16:51,754 --> 00:16:53,654
I'm telling you,
Chuck is behind this.

275
00:16:53,656 --> 00:16:54,922
No, you are behind this.

276
00:16:54,924 --> 00:16:59,393
I told you this would happen,
and now I'm paying the price.

277
00:16:59,794 --> 00:17:00,928
I should've known better.

278
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:04,999
So, now, I'm keeping my head down
and I'm getting through this.

279
00:17:05,001 --> 00:17:08,802
And I'm most
certainly not suing HHM.

280
00:17:08,804 --> 00:17:10,070
Kim...

281
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:13,140
Even if I won,
who would hire me?

282
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:14,942
That would be career suicide.

283
00:17:14,944 --> 00:17:19,513
All right.
Then I quit Davis & Main.

284
00:17:19,515 --> 00:17:20,648
What does that accomplish?

285
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:22,616
It's the only way to
get you out of dutch.

286
00:17:22,618 --> 00:17:27,354
Because this is about Chuck,
whether you wanna believe it or not.

287
00:17:27,356 --> 00:17:30,057
I give him what he wants,
he lets up on you.

288
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:34,995
Wow. My knight in shining armor.
That is some sacrifice.

289
00:17:34,997 --> 00:17:36,730
Quitting a job
that you've been trying

290
00:17:36,732 --> 00:17:38,165
to tank since day one.

291
00:17:38,167 --> 00:17:39,333
That's not true.

292
00:17:39,335 --> 00:17:42,403
I dig myself out of this hole.

293
00:17:42,405 --> 00:17:44,838
You do your job, Jimmy.

294
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,876
Prove you can go one week.
Hell, one day

295
00:17:48,878 --> 00:17:52,313
without breaking the rules of
the New Mexico Bar Association,

296
00:17:52,315 --> 00:17:53,514
or pissing off your boss.

297
00:17:53,516 --> 00:17:54,982
And don't insult my intelligence

298
00:17:54,984 --> 00:17:58,452
by saying you are
doing any of this for me.

299
00:18:00,388 --> 00:18:02,990
You don't save me.

300
00:18:03,758 --> 00:18:05,926
I save me.

301
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,831
Just please go.

302
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,055
Hey. Is Erin in yet?

303
00:18:43,566 --> 00:18:46,367
Goddamn pixie ninja.

304
00:18:46,901 --> 00:18:49,370
<i>I owe you a big apology.</i>

305
00:18:49,704 --> 00:18:52,906
I have a medical condition.
GERD.

306
00:18:52,908 --> 00:18:55,909
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

307
00:18:55,911 --> 00:18:57,478
I know, it's a mouthful, right?

308
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,714
It affects the lower
oesophageal sphincter.

309
00:19:00,716 --> 00:19:03,717
I took a risk yesterday at lunch
with some onion rings,

310
00:19:03,719 --> 00:19:06,353
and last night...
Are we doing this, or not?

311
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:08,389
You bet.

312
00:19:14,864 --> 00:19:16,697
<i>Hey, Jerry,
it's Kim Wexler.</i>

313
00:19:16,699 --> 00:19:18,665
<i>How's things with
the alumni group?</i>

314
00:19:19,368 --> 00:19:22,136
Top 50? Go UNM Law!

315
00:19:22,138 --> 00:19:25,372
Hey, wondering if you've heard
that Santa Fe Place is looking

316
00:19:25,374 --> 00:19:26,640
for new outside counsel?

317
00:19:26,642 --> 00:19:31,812
They should really be considering
Hamlin Hamlin & McGill. We...

318
00:19:31,814 --> 00:19:34,181
Huh. Must've just been a rumor.

319
00:19:34,183 --> 00:19:36,917
Yeah, let's grab a drink soon.

320
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:39,820
You, too. Okay, bye.

321
00:19:43,992 --> 00:19:45,692
Hey, uh, I remember
you mentioned your

322
00:19:45,694 --> 00:19:48,061
brother worked in
Intel's legal department?

323
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:50,164
I'm an attorney at
Hamlin Hamlin & McGill,

324
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:51,565
would you happen
to know if Intel

325
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:54,201
is happy with their
legal representation?

326
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:57,838
That's flattering, but I'm seeing
someone at the moment.

327
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,643
So, you know what? Just call the
main number and they'll find me.

328
00:20:06,314 --> 00:20:08,482
Yeah, no,
we had drinks a few days ago,

329
00:20:08,484 --> 00:20:10,250
and she said you
had a friend who...

330
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:12,386
<i>So, they already settled.</i>

331
00:20:12,388 --> 00:20:15,856
I heard you ended
up at Harvard Law.

332
00:20:15,858 --> 00:20:18,425
Yeah. Yeah, she was my roommate.

333
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:21,862
Listen, uh, I'm an attorney
at Hamlin Hamlin & McGill.

334
00:20:21,864 --> 00:20:23,797
We're actually known for teaming

335
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:25,632
with other firms
on large contracts.

336
00:20:25,634 --> 00:20:30,337
Schweikart? Sure. Yeah,
I know them well. It's a great firm.

337
00:20:30,339 --> 00:20:33,474
<i>We met at that
ABA mixer last year?</i>

338
00:20:33,476 --> 00:20:34,942
Yep, bourbon shots. That was me.

339
00:20:34,944 --> 00:20:38,111
Well, congrats on landing
the Honeywell contract.

340
00:20:38,113 --> 00:20:40,113
<i>Huge amount of work.</i>

341
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:41,815
You, too.

342
00:20:59,601 --> 00:21:01,201
How was your lunch? Good.

343
00:21:01,203 --> 00:21:04,071
What'd you have?
Uh, turkey wrap.

344
00:21:19,387 --> 00:21:20,754
<i>How's the place?</i>

345
00:21:20,756 --> 00:21:25,559
<i>It's great. It's safe,
quiet, they allow dogs.</i>

346
00:21:25,561 --> 00:21:27,861
<i>We can't ask for more than that.</i>

347
00:21:27,863 --> 00:21:29,763
I can't get
Kaylee out of the pool.

348
00:21:29,765 --> 00:21:31,665
By the end of the day,
she's a prune.

349
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:34,668
<i>I'm glad she's enjoying it.</i>

350
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,738
Hey, I better get her
dinner started soon.

351
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,472
<i>Go to the restaurant.</i>

352
00:21:38,474 --> 00:21:40,641
No, it's too expensive.
I have groceries in the room.

353
00:21:40,643 --> 00:21:44,778
<i>Don't worry about that.
Take her out.</i>

354
00:21:44,946 --> 00:21:47,114
Thanks, Mike.

355
00:21:48,716 --> 00:21:49,349
She misses you.

356
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:50,584
<i>You think you
might come by later?</i>

357
00:21:50,586 --> 00:21:56,423
No, not yet. I don't want her
to see me looking like this.

358
00:21:56,624 --> 00:21:58,125
<i>How bad was it?</i>

359
00:21:58,127 --> 00:22:02,429
Well, I can tell you, the next car
I get's gonna have airbags.

360
00:22:02,431 --> 00:22:05,766
Well, whenever you
feel you're ready.

361
00:22:05,768 --> 00:22:08,202
It's okay.
It looks worse than it is.

362
00:22:08,204 --> 00:22:10,538
You give Kaylee a kiss for me.

363
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,305
<i>I will.</i>

364
00:22:11,307 --> 00:22:13,074
All right. Bye, darling.

365
00:22:15,443 --> 00:22:19,479
Whoa, whoa, hold up.
What the hell happened to you?

366
00:22:19,847 --> 00:22:22,583
I get it. The first
rule of Fight Club, right?

367
00:22:22,585 --> 00:22:26,186
Let me introduce you.
This is my babysitter, Erin.

368
00:22:26,188 --> 00:22:29,790
Erin, this is my Grandpa, Mike.

369
00:22:30,158 --> 00:22:31,959
Nice to meet you.

370
00:22:43,905 --> 00:22:44,905
Thanks, Tim.

371
00:22:44,907 --> 00:22:46,773
Good seeing you, Jimmy.

372
00:22:46,775 --> 00:22:50,310
Listen, this clerk and I go
way back. We're like this.

373
00:22:50,312 --> 00:22:53,547
But she needs a little finessing,
so can I handle it?

374
00:22:53,549 --> 00:22:54,615
Yeah, sure.

375
00:22:54,617 --> 00:22:58,652
Surprise! Bet you never
thought you'd see me again.

376
00:22:58,654 --> 00:22:59,353
Mmm.. hmm.

377
00:22:59,355 --> 00:23:01,722
I need a summary
judgment hearing

378
00:23:01,724 --> 00:23:03,523
with Michaelis for
<i>Bray v. O'Connell,</i>

379
00:23:03,525 --> 00:23:07,661
and I'm hoping for Thursday
at 10:00, before he...

380
00:23:10,398 --> 00:23:11,465
Don't have it.

381
00:23:11,467 --> 00:23:13,533
Thursday at noon, perhaps?

382
00:23:13,535 --> 00:23:14,835
Nope.

383
00:23:14,837 --> 00:23:19,039
Thursday at 2:00.
Now that's my final...

384
00:23:24,479 --> 00:23:28,982
You're pretty.
Will you be my new mommy?

385
00:23:30,251 --> 00:23:32,486
What are you doing?

386
00:23:34,088 --> 00:23:35,055
What?

387
00:23:35,057 --> 00:23:36,223
That's a bribe!

388
00:23:36,225 --> 00:23:37,024
It's a gift.

389
00:23:37,026 --> 00:23:40,293
That's how it works here.
You grease the wheels of justice.

390
00:23:40,295 --> 00:23:42,329
Give me...
That's not how it works.

391
00:23:42,331 --> 00:23:45,699
You submit the paperwork
and you get a date. Period.

392
00:23:45,701 --> 00:23:49,436
What don't you
understand about finessing?

393
00:23:53,508 --> 00:23:56,910
I apologize for my colleague.
She's new.

394
00:23:56,912 --> 00:24:01,482
Is there any possible way
we can still get Thursday?

395
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,318
I'll give you 2:30 Thursday.

396
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,619
The 14th.

397
00:24:05,621 --> 00:24:07,654
That's next month.

398
00:24:11,092 --> 00:24:13,493
We'll take it.

399
00:24:16,431 --> 00:24:19,800
So, does this go on my
official Stasi report?

400
00:24:19,802 --> 00:24:22,002
I'm not trying to
get you in trouble.

401
00:24:22,004 --> 00:24:23,403
I'm trying to
keep you out of it.

402
00:24:23,405 --> 00:24:26,406
I'm gonna hit the men's room.

403
00:24:26,408 --> 00:24:28,241
The men's room.

404
00:24:43,191 --> 00:24:45,325
Hey, how you doing, Bill?

405
00:24:45,327 --> 00:24:47,728
How am I doing? How are you?

406
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:48,662
You know, hanging in.

407
00:24:48,664 --> 00:24:51,932
Yeah. Word on the street is you're
over at Davis & Main now.

408
00:24:51,934 --> 00:24:53,567
You lucky son of a bitch.

409
00:24:53,569 --> 00:24:56,303
Oh, you know,
dancing with the devil.

410
00:24:56,305 --> 00:24:57,771
So, how are things
at the District Attorney..

411
00:24:57,773 --> 00:25:02,075
Davis & Main!
Man, that must be sweet.

412
00:25:02,077 --> 00:25:04,377
They give you a car?
Bet they gave you a car.

413
00:25:04,379 --> 00:25:05,646
Yeah. They gave me car.

414
00:25:05,648 --> 00:25:07,180
What kind?

415
00:25:07,182 --> 00:25:07,914
It's a...

416
00:25:07,916 --> 00:25:10,183
No! Don't tell me!
I don't want to know.

417
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:14,287
I bet it's German. Is it German?

418
00:25:14,289 --> 00:25:16,990
Yeah, it's German.
The cup holder's...

419
00:25:16,992 --> 00:25:20,827
You got a sick office?
I bet you got a sick office.

420
00:25:20,829 --> 00:25:23,697
Pretty sick, it's got
a little fireplace.

421
00:25:23,699 --> 00:25:27,634
Fireplace! I'd kill my
mother for a fireplace.

422
00:25:27,636 --> 00:25:30,937
Hell, I'd kill her for a window.

423
00:25:31,539 --> 00:25:33,073
You have an assistant, right?

424
00:25:33,075 --> 00:25:35,942
Don't tell me. Is she hot?
She's hot, right?

425
00:25:35,944 --> 00:25:39,679
She is a bright
young man named Omar.

426
00:25:40,214 --> 00:25:41,181
Omar.

427
00:25:41,183 --> 00:25:45,085
Hey, you've got
a little something on your...

428
00:25:45,087 --> 00:25:47,220
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

429
00:25:47,222 --> 00:25:48,789
It's vomit. Again.

430
00:25:48,791 --> 00:25:53,326
The worst part? Could've come
from two different defendants.

431
00:25:53,328 --> 00:25:56,930
Scumbags. They're all scumbags.

432
00:25:56,932 --> 00:26:00,066
Oh, my God, where you living?
They put you up?

433
00:26:00,068 --> 00:26:02,335
It's a corporate apartment.
It's just...

434
00:26:02,337 --> 00:26:04,371
Ah, no! Don't tell me.

435
00:26:04,373 --> 00:26:06,006
Christ.

436
00:26:07,375 --> 00:26:08,141
Ah, damn it, I gotta run.

437
00:26:08,143 --> 00:26:14,614
I'm putting away some brain dead
suckwad, who tried to rob a library.

438
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:16,349
Good seeing you, Bill.

439
00:26:16,351 --> 00:26:17,551
Have a great day.

440
00:26:17,553 --> 00:26:19,419
Yeah. Yeah.

441
00:26:19,421 --> 00:26:22,289
Lucky bastard.

442
00:26:42,577 --> 00:26:45,779
Hello. Hi. This is Kim Wexler.

443
00:26:45,781 --> 00:26:49,316
I did leave a message.
And I was just...

444
00:26:51,152 --> 00:26:52,552
Yes, ma'am.

445
00:26:53,054 --> 00:26:55,055
I'm sorry to bother you.

446
00:27:04,732 --> 00:27:08,134
Hi. This is Kim Wexler.
I was looking for Jennifer Johnson.

447
00:27:08,136 --> 00:27:09,936
No, not his secretary,
I'm an attorney.

448
00:27:09,938 --> 00:27:15,141
Yes I did. I got your number from Chris.
Sure, I will let them know.

449
00:27:15,143 --> 00:27:17,644
Okay. Nope.
Got it. Totally understand.

450
00:27:17,646 --> 00:27:21,548
This is Kim Wexler from
Hamlin Hamlin & McGill.

451
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:24,417
Actually... Hi. Can I just...

452
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:27,988
Would you tell him
I'll call him right back?

453
00:27:35,596 --> 00:27:38,732
<i>Okay. Just let me know
when it's a good time.</i>

454
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,407
Got it.

455
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:50,577
Okay. Thanks for your time.

456
00:27:58,786 --> 00:28:01,288
Hi, Claudia? Kim Wexler.

457
00:28:01,455 --> 00:28:02,956
I'll let him know.

458
00:28:08,829 --> 00:28:14,401
<i>This is Kim Wexler.
I was lookingfor Jillian Coagen.</i>

459
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:19,372
<i>I met you last
year at the ABA mixer.</i>

460
00:28:19,707 --> 00:28:23,376
For your advice.
Let me get you some.

461
00:28:23,378 --> 00:28:27,213
All right.
Just give me a call. Great.

462
00:28:37,058 --> 00:28:40,126
<i>Kim Wexler.
I did call yesterday.</i>

463
00:28:40,795 --> 00:28:43,263
Okay. I totally get it.

464
00:29:34,282 --> 00:29:36,951
Kim Wexler.
Hey. How are you, Paige?

465
00:29:37,386 --> 00:29:39,986
You did?

466
00:29:42,089 --> 00:29:44,157
That's so nice to hear.

467
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,960
I thought we hit
it off, as well.

468
00:29:48,964 --> 00:29:50,131
Really?

469
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,102
I... I couldn't be
more thrilled.

470
00:29:56,104 --> 00:29:59,139
I mean, the firm and I.

471
00:29:59,874 --> 00:30:00,874
Absolutely.
I'll tell him right now.

472
00:30:00,876 --> 00:30:04,677
I'm sure we can get something
on the books tomorrow.

473
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:07,347
Day after, at the latest.

474
00:30:07,548 --> 00:30:11,217
Thank you, Paige. Me, too.

475
00:30:11,819 --> 00:30:13,721
Okay, bye.

476
00:30:18,959 --> 00:30:21,027
Yes!

477
00:30:59,033 --> 00:31:01,201
- There she is. Hi.
- Hi.

478
00:31:01,203 --> 00:31:02,702
Paige, so good to see you!

479
00:31:02,704 --> 00:31:03,736
You, too.

480
00:31:03,738 --> 00:31:05,772
Kim, this is Kevin Wachtell,
our CEO.

481
00:31:05,774 --> 00:31:07,974
Kim Wexler.
Great to meet you, Kevin.

482
00:31:07,976 --> 00:31:08,441
And you.

483
00:31:08,443 --> 00:31:11,444
Paige, Kevin, this is Howard Hamlin,
our senior partner.

484
00:31:11,446 --> 00:31:12,378
Pleasure. Likewise.

485
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:14,280
We're thrilled to
have you folks here.

486
00:31:14,282 --> 00:31:16,015
Kevin, true story.
When I was seven years old,

487
00:31:16,017 --> 00:31:19,486
my very first bank account was at
Mesa Verde, if you can believe it.

488
00:31:19,488 --> 00:31:23,389
I can. Mine was too, back when
my dad ran the place!

489
00:31:23,391 --> 00:31:25,091
Wow. I can remember the cover of

490
00:31:25,093 --> 00:31:27,394
my first passbook.
It was a silhouette of a...

491
00:31:27,396 --> 00:31:28,195
Cowboy.

492
00:31:28,197 --> 00:31:29,996
A cowboy on horseback. Yes.

493
00:31:29,998 --> 00:31:31,898
Standing next to a cactus.

494
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,832
I loved that cowboy.

495
00:31:32,834 --> 00:31:34,801
Far as I was concerned,
I was saving up for that horse.

496
00:31:34,803 --> 00:31:38,738
What the heck else is money good
for when you're seven years old?

497
00:31:39,841 --> 00:31:41,407
So, we have
a little presentation

498
00:31:41,409 --> 00:31:42,242
for you in our conference room.

499
00:31:42,244 --> 00:31:46,146
Along with some snacks and a soy
mocha latte with your name on it.

500
00:31:46,148 --> 00:31:47,981
Oh. This one? She's a keeper.

501
00:31:47,983 --> 00:31:50,583
- Shall we?
- Let's do it.

502
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:02,562
Well, I think that couldn't
have gone any better.

503
00:32:02,564 --> 00:32:04,597
Pleasure to meet you.
Fantastic. I'll see you soon.

504
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:08,034
Thanks for setting this up.
I'll talk to you soon.

505
00:32:08,636 --> 00:32:11,271
Lovely to meet you, Paige.

506
00:32:27,354 --> 00:32:28,721
Congratulations.

507
00:32:28,723 --> 00:32:30,823
Right back at you.

508
00:32:31,458 --> 00:32:34,661
I'll circle back with Paige,
get the ball rolling,

509
00:32:34,663 --> 00:32:35,562
start talking strategy,
you know.

510
00:32:35,564 --> 00:32:40,967
Maybe put together a list of staff
associates we can put on this.

511
00:32:40,969 --> 00:32:42,302
I'll put Francis on that.

512
00:32:42,304 --> 00:32:46,539
You've got enough on
your plate in doc review.

513
00:33:10,031 --> 00:33:11,332
Coming.

514
00:33:14,402 --> 00:33:15,202
Huh.

515
00:33:15,904 --> 00:33:18,438
Hey!
Catch you at a bad time?

516
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,106
Not at all. Come in.

517
00:33:24,712 --> 00:33:25,445
I hear clinking.

518
00:33:25,447 --> 00:33:29,015
Does that mean we have
something to celebrate?

519
00:33:29,217 --> 00:33:31,317
We sure do.

520
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:42,095
What are we drinking to?

521
00:33:42,197 --> 00:33:44,397
Got a juicy one for you.

522
00:33:45,066 --> 00:33:46,566
Mesa Verde!

523
00:33:46,568 --> 00:33:47,600
On retainer.

524
00:33:47,602 --> 00:33:48,803
Oh, even better.

525
00:33:51,205 --> 00:33:55,008
Congratulations. One of
your golf course conquests?

526
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:58,444
Kim Wexler brought them in.

527
00:33:58,446 --> 00:34:02,749
Fourth year associate snags a
quarter of a million in billings?

528
00:34:02,751 --> 00:34:06,452
She's probably having
a couple drinks herself.

529
00:34:06,454 --> 00:34:08,255
She's out of the doghouse,
I assume?

530
00:34:10,324 --> 00:34:11,524
We'll see.

531
00:34:11,793 --> 00:34:12,226
Huh.

532
00:34:14,028 --> 00:34:15,295
Hmm.

533
00:34:16,196 --> 00:34:20,433
Interstate expansion.
Complex case.

534
00:34:20,501 --> 00:34:22,902
That's two,
maybe, three regulatory

535
00:34:22,904 --> 00:34:25,071
commissions we'll
be dealing with.

536
00:34:25,073 --> 00:34:28,709
Months of work for HHM.
Maybe years.

537
00:35:20,227 --> 00:35:24,130
Good morning, Rudolpho.
Good morning, Mr. McGill.

538
00:36:07,608 --> 00:36:09,742
Oh, sorry!

539
00:36:11,278 --> 00:36:14,347
I didn't know anyone was here.

540
00:36:14,349 --> 00:36:16,916
Just dropping off
some Sandpiper stuff.

541
00:36:16,918 --> 00:36:18,851
You're in early.

542
00:36:18,853 --> 00:36:20,319
More like late.

543
00:36:22,523 --> 00:36:25,391
Well, regardless of the hour,
good to see you here.

544
00:36:25,393 --> 00:36:27,260
Yeah, I'm trying something new,

545
00:36:27,262 --> 00:36:29,462
um, coming in,
working until 9:00.

546
00:36:29,464 --> 00:36:33,300
It's easier before the place opens,
without all the lights,

547
00:36:33,968 --> 00:36:35,935
and the phones ringing.

548
00:36:37,371 --> 00:36:39,005
How about some coffee?

549
00:36:39,007 --> 00:36:40,573
No, thank you.

550
00:36:41,141 --> 00:36:43,543
Would you mind making me some?

551
00:36:43,545 --> 00:36:47,046
I apologize, it's just,
I can't do it myself,

552
00:36:47,048 --> 00:36:48,882
what with the electricity.

553
00:36:51,152 --> 00:36:52,118
Sure.

554
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:57,256
No sugar. Just a splash of soy milk.
I think we have it.

555
00:37:00,327 --> 00:37:01,794
Kim?

556
00:37:02,329 --> 00:37:04,897
Um, make two cups.

557
00:37:20,247 --> 00:37:22,215
Well, I guess it's
true what they say.

558
00:37:22,217 --> 00:37:24,617
The early bird gets the worm.

559
00:37:24,619 --> 00:37:26,786
Which is good,
if you like worms.

560
00:37:29,257 --> 00:37:30,057
Hmm.

561
00:37:35,596 --> 00:37:37,130
May I ask you a question?

562
00:37:37,232 --> 00:37:38,931
Of course.

563
00:37:38,933 --> 00:37:42,201
Do I have a future at this firm?

564
00:37:43,871 --> 00:37:46,272
We have a lot in common,
you and I.

565
00:37:46,941 --> 00:37:49,642
My brother left
you holding the bag.

566
00:37:49,644 --> 00:37:52,211
If it makes you feel any better,
you're not the first person

567
00:37:52,213 --> 00:37:54,480
to go out on a limb for him.

568
00:37:54,482 --> 00:37:58,584
I made the same mistake
over and over again.

569
00:37:59,019 --> 00:38:01,420
And now Howard has.

570
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:03,556
And he blames you.

571
00:38:06,026 --> 00:38:08,094
It's a damned mess.

572
00:38:11,865 --> 00:38:15,135
Did Jimmy ever tell you
anything about our father?

573
00:38:15,803 --> 00:38:18,070
Not much, no.

574
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:22,074
My dad. Our dad...

575
00:38:22,176 --> 00:38:24,377
He was,

576
00:38:24,545 --> 00:38:29,982
well,
the personification of good.

577
00:38:30,417 --> 00:38:34,987
I'm not sure he could even
see sin, in any form.

578
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:38,591
He was born without the gene.

579
00:38:38,792 --> 00:38:40,993
He ran a little
corner store in Cicero,

580
00:38:40,995 --> 00:38:43,296
cigarettes behind
the counter, penny candy.

581
00:38:43,298 --> 00:38:48,100
Nothing special, but it
kept food on the table.

582
00:38:48,435 --> 00:38:51,237
And the neighborhood loved Dad.

583
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:56,409
He knew everybody's name,
what was going on in their lives.

584
00:38:57,111 --> 00:38:59,312
This little corner.

585
00:38:59,813 --> 00:39:01,347
He made it better.

586
00:39:04,218 --> 00:39:06,552
I was named after him.

587
00:39:07,988 --> 00:39:11,224
Before that, he had worked for
a lot of people over the years,

588
00:39:11,226 --> 00:39:13,960
and his dream was
to be his own boss.

589
00:39:13,962 --> 00:39:17,496
He put everything he
had into that place.

590
00:39:17,498 --> 00:39:21,667
I was away at college when
he put Jimmy to work there.

591
00:39:21,669 --> 00:39:26,205
Jimmy grew up in that store,
watching our father.

592
00:39:28,275 --> 00:39:31,677
But Dad was not the world's
greatest businessman,

593
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:34,947
and eventually,
he ran into money troubles.

594
00:39:34,949 --> 00:39:36,782
I had a clerkship at the time,

595
00:39:36,784 --> 00:39:41,488
but I came home to help him get his
books in order, set the ship straight.

596
00:39:42,089 --> 00:39:44,156
Now, I'm no accountant,

597
00:39:44,158 --> 00:39:45,692
but I discovered

598
00:39:45,694 --> 00:39:50,1 29
$14,000 was just gone.

599
00:39:50,397 --> 00:39:52,466
Vanished over the years.

600
00:39:54,401 --> 00:39:58,237
Turns out Jimmy had pilfered
it in drips and drabs.

601
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:01,207
Just took it out of the till.

602
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:06,012
My dad wouldn't hear it.

603
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:10,449
Nope. Not his Jimmy.

604
00:40:13,554 --> 00:40:16,455
He ended up having to sell.

605
00:40:16,457 --> 00:40:19,592
Six months later, he was dead.

606
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:24,296
At the funeral, no one
cried harder than Jimmy.

607
00:40:32,105 --> 00:40:35,241
My brother is not a bad person.

608
00:40:35,609 --> 00:40:38,110
He has a good heart.

609
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:40,680
It's just,

610
00:40:42,949 --> 00:40:44,750
he can't help himself.

611
00:40:46,086 --> 00:40:50,122
And everyone is left
picking up the pieces.

612
00:40:52,693 --> 00:40:57,196
Is there any coffee left?
No. I got it.

613
00:41:00,801 --> 00:41:05,471
I'll talk to Howard. Pour a
little oil on troubled waters.

614
00:41:05,473 --> 00:41:08,508
You're being wasted
down in doc review.

615
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:11,243
Good job with Mesa Verde.

616
00:41:53,954 --> 00:41:56,4 89
Mind if I join you?

617
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:02,061
Hi. What can I get you?

618
00:42:02,063 --> 00:42:03,697
Coffee. Black.

619
00:42:04,399 --> 00:42:06,299
It's coming right up.

620
00:42:08,402 --> 00:42:09,535
Mmm.

621
00:42:09,737 --> 00:42:13,672
He really did a number on you.

622
00:42:17,377 --> 00:42:18,578
Sorry. I know you?

623
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:23,149
The young man who did that
to you, he's my nephew.

624
00:42:23,151 --> 00:42:28,420
Hothead. Always has been.
Kid thinks he's a boxer.

625
00:42:28,488 --> 00:42:32,191
He should have
shown you respect.

626
00:42:33,093 --> 00:42:36,629
I apologize to you

627
00:42:36,631 --> 00:42:39,064
on behalf of my family.

628
00:42:41,802 --> 00:42:44,603
Apology accepted.

629
00:42:44,871 --> 00:42:48,240
And you know what?
He should go to jail.

630
00:42:48,242 --> 00:42:53,679
Best thing for him. Teach
him respect for his elders.

631
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:58,184
But not for eight years.

632
00:42:58,186 --> 00:43:01,587
Less. Much less.

633
00:43:18,705 --> 00:43:21,607
You see what I'm getting at?

634
00:43:21,608 --> 00:43:22,675
Not really.

635
00:43:23,277 --> 00:43:28,180
The gun charge, that's eight years
he's going away, maybe 10.

636
00:43:28,182 --> 00:43:33,085
Aggravated assault, the gun,
plus, he got your wallet.

637
00:43:33,087 --> 00:43:35,021
That's right.

638
00:43:36,022 --> 00:43:42,194
I would like for you to tell the
police that the gun was yours.

639
00:43:42,196 --> 00:43:43,830
Would you?

640
00:43:44,132 --> 00:43:46,966
You're both a little
hot under the collar

641
00:43:46,968 --> 00:43:49,735
about whether you
bumped his car or not.

642
00:43:49,737 --> 00:43:54,040
But there was a scuffle
and he got your gun.

643
00:43:54,508 --> 00:43:55,641
My gun?

644
00:43:55,743 --> 00:43:57,843
Your gun from your pocket.

645
00:43:57,845 --> 00:44:02,815
He got it, and that's
how his prints got on it.

646
00:44:02,916 --> 00:44:06,352
Then I would be
subject to the gun charge.

647
00:44:07,154 --> 00:44:09,789
You're an ex-cop.

648
00:44:09,891 --> 00:44:12,224
They'll go easy on you.

649
00:44:12,593 --> 00:44:14,827
So, you're a psychic.

650
00:44:15,029 --> 00:44:19,999
I'll even twist Tuco's ear,
make him apologize.

651
00:44:20,067 --> 00:44:23,168
And he serves for battery.

652
00:44:23,503 --> 00:44:25,638
Nothing else.

653
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:34,480
I'm looking for the best possible
outcome for everybody.

654
00:44:35,716 --> 00:44:39,485
And for your trouble,

655
00:44:39,753 --> 00:44:43,322
you take home $5,000.

656
00:44:55,903 --> 00:44:57,770
Think about it.
