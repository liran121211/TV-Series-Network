<i> Bali ha'i </i>

35
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,283
<i>All right. There you go.</i>

36
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:03,121
<i>That completes our week-long
tour of</i> South Pacific.

37
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:03,755
<i>You're welcome.</i>

00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,491
<i>Tomorrow we</i>
<i>begin our exploration</i>

of the Carpenters' catalog.

40
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:09,795
Of course,
I am open to requests.

41
00:07:09,797 --> 00:07:13,331
That's right.
All you gotta do is call me.

42
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,699
Anytime.

43
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:17,302
All right?

44
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:19,137
Bye. Call me.

45
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,973
Boundaries, Mrs. Nguyen.
Boundaries.

46
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:25,777
Why are you here?
You lose that job already?

47
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:26,978
I should be so lucky.

48
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,547
You don't like your job?

49
00:07:28,549 --> 00:07:29,581
Boo-hoo. Poor baby.

50
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:34,753
You know, some people work for a living.
No one gives us free cars.

51
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:35,620
So why you here?

52
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:39,458
This place is paid up. I'm within
my rights as your legal tenant.

53
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,926
That's all you need to know.

54
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:43,762
Do I smell coffee?
Have you got a pot on?

55
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:44,629
Why?

56
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,431
How about a fill-up?

57
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:48,733
You can afford to buy your own!

58
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:52,471
Faster I get coffee,
the faster I'm out of here.

59
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:03,081
<i>Chao cac co,</i> ladies.

60
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:19,631
Son of a...

61
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:57,969
You haven't unpacked yet?

62
00:08:57,971 --> 00:09:00,372
Kevin and Paige are here.

63
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:02,173
Absolutely.

64
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:31,269
I don't know exactly what
Chuck may have said to you,

65
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:36,341
but just so you know, I did not
ask him to step in on my behalf.

66
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:57,495
Hi, guys! Sorry for the wait.

67
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:59,297
Not a problem. Hi.

68
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:01,533
So good to see you again.
Howard.

69
00:10:01,535 --> 00:10:02,133
Hi, Kim.

70
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:04,736
Good to see you, too!
Hi, Paige. Hi, Kevin.

71
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:05,604
Kim, great to see you.

72
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:07,505
Please have a seat. Thank you.

73
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:08,773
Kevin, how's your grandson?

74
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:13,211
Out of control. Just running
circles around all of us.

75
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:14,572
Hello. Can I help you?

76
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:18,376
You know why I'm here?

77
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:21,446
He needs an answer.

78
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:30,622
Respectfully,
I'm gonna have to say no.

79
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:36,928
You sure about that?

80
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,496
I am.

81
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,702
Your Honor, the defense has made
the very reasonable request

82
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:52,670
that the plaintiffs produce their
medical records, or barring that,

83
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:57,175
a signed HIPAA release so that we
can examine the records ourselves.

84
00:12:57,177 --> 00:12:58,910
Your Honor, our clients'
medical records

85
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:01,246
have no bearing on
the merits of this case.

86
00:13:01,248 --> 00:13:03,014
The medical records
are plainly relevant

87
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:04,716
as they bear directly
on our contention

88
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:07,552
that the plaintiffs are not
adequate class representatives.

89
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:12,323
This is a transparent attempt
at intimidation, nothing more.

90
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:12,724
How so?

91
00:13:12,726 --> 00:13:15,326
Many of our clients have information
in their medical records

92
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:17,328
that they prefer
to keep private.

93
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,530
They're fearful,
as any of us would be,

94
00:13:18,532 --> 00:13:20,131
at the thought of
a bunch of strangers

95
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,666
poking around in
their personal files.

96
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:23,001
And by forcing them
to reveal this information,

97
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:26,271
the defense is banking on them
simply dropping out of the case.

98
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:29,808
Your Honor, this is about class
certification. That's all.

99
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,576
If the named
plaintiffs are suffering from

100
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:33,077
dementia or other
mental deficiencies...

101
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:34,379
You're saying
they're incompetent?

102
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:36,247
I'm saying we have
a right to any record

103
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:37,415
that would speak
to their competency

104
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:38,716
as regards this class
certification issue.

105
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:40,952
Your Honor, it seems like the
defense wants it both ways, then.

106
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:42,987
If our clients are
suffering from dementia,

107
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,455
then the residency
contracts they signed

108
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:46,858
with Sandpiper couldn't have
been entered into knowingly.

109
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:47,926
No. No,
that is not what we...

110
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:50,562
The defense wants to claim that
their residents are competent enough

111
00:13:50,564 --> 00:13:54,465
to be held to their contracts,
but too incompetent to sue.

112
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:54,999
So which is it?

113
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,702
Many of the residents signed
their contracts years ago.

114
00:13:57,704 --> 00:14:00,438
And at the time, they
were perfectly competent.

115
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,472
But that can change,

116
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:04,409
especially when we're talking
about elderly individuals.

117
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:07,545
Or maybe Sandpiper preyed on
mentally incompetent seniors

118
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:09,080
and bilked them
out of their money.

119
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:10,515
Ms. Wexler...

120
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:15,253
I am simply trying to defend our
clients from bullying by the defense.

121
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:17,188
Your Honor, as stated in
the brief in front of you,

122
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:21,626
this is a standard request granted
in every case of its kind.

123
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:23,795
This is not about bullying.

124
00:14:23,797 --> 00:14:25,663
Granting this
invasion of privacy

125
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:27,699
allows our clients to
be doubly victimized.

126
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:31,336
I ask that you deny the
defense's motion, Your Honor.

127
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:33,404
I'm leaning toward
granting the motion,

128
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:36,307
but I would like to review the
pleadings and briefs again.

129
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:39,310
I'll have my
decision for you shortly.

130
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:41,112
Adjourned.

131
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:49,821
I'm gonna meet you
back at the office.

132
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,963
Ms. Wexler?

133
00:14:58,965 --> 00:14:59,697
Hey.

134
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:02,967
I just wanted to say,
good work in there.

135
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:05,003
Thanks. But I'm
pretty sure I lost.

136
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:07,272
Of course you did.
It's an unwinnable position.

137
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:09,207
That's why your boss
didn't bother showing up.

138
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:13,244
But you went down swinging,
and I admire that.

139
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:14,312
Thank you.

140
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:16,481
What are you doing for lunch?

141
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:19,918
Probably just grabbing something
from the vending machines.

142
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,054
Oof.
We can do better than that.

143
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:26,658
Mr. Schweikart.
Good to see you, sir.

144
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,859
How you doing, Sean?
Very well.

145
00:15:27,861 --> 00:15:31,095
Can I get some drinks for you two?
Your usual Moscow Mule?

146
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:31,696
Absolutely.

147
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:35,566
You want one? Best
Moscow Mule in the city.

148
00:15:36,002 --> 00:15:39,737
Fresh ginger, real
copper mug, the works.

149
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:42,507
That's very vintage.
But I'm good.

150
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:45,043
Just an iced tea. You sure?

151
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:46,778
All right, then.
I'll be the sole degenerate

152
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,980
who's drinking in
the middle of the workday.

153
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:51,049
That, too, is vintage.

154
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:53,952
I'll get those started.

155
00:15:54,888 --> 00:15:58,923
So, you've been with HHM,
what? Ten years?

156
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,260
Yeah. Last August.

157
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:04,762
And you started
in the mail room?

158
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:07,098
I did. I was six years there.

159
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:07,865
How did you know that?

160
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:09,500
I asked around.
It's a small town.

161
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:13,705
It sounds like you
certainly paid your dues.

162
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:14,572
I was very fortunate.

163
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:16,941
HHM put me through
law school while I worked.

164
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:18,242
That's great that they
foster talent like that.

165
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:21,446
And I imagine you're paying
it off as part of your deal?

166
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:22,313
Yeah, happily.

167
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:23,815
It's a pretty
standard arrangement.

168
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:26,417
I have to say,
watching you in court today,

169
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:29,854
it sure did bring back
some old memories for me.

170
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:31,189
One in particular, anyway.

171
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:33,324
Yeah? I was a year
out of law school

172
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:37,295
at this firm in Boston, and I was
finally put on my first big case.

173
00:16:37,297 --> 00:16:39,897
This huge employment
discrimination suit.

174
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,266
That thing kept us in
billing for a decade.

175
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:45,003
Anyway, we landed this monster,

176
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:47,038
and I find out I'm
second chair to one of

177
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,973
the partners on
the preliminary hearing.

178
00:16:48,975 --> 00:16:51,009
And I think, "This is it!"

179
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:54,245
"This is what will define
the rest of my career."

180
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:56,414
So, the hearing's
getting closer and closer.

181
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,683
I even get this new
suit that I can't afford.

182
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:00,418
I split it over
three credit cards.

183
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,454
I'm probably still
paying it off to this day.

184
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:08,459
So, I go in bright and early, I'm
wearing my new suit, prepping my table,

185
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:10,561
and in walks
the opposing counsel.

186
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:11,262
There's four of them.

187
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:14,599
One senior partner and three
high-level associates.

188
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:18,736
These guys have been litigating
longer than I've been alive.

189
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:20,738
But I think... ""

190
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,574
"I'm good, I've got my boss
coming, it'll be fine."

191
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:29,847
So I'm sitting alone at my table,
waiting for my boss to show.

192
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,450
And I'm waiting.
And I'm waiting.

193
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:35,887
And then suddenly they're calling
us to order, and I realize

194
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:39,223
that no one from my firm is coming.
It's just me.

195
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:42,427
So I think, "All right, then.
This is the moment."

196
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:45,363
And I get up there and I argue
like my life depended on it.

197
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:49,200
I'm sweating and I'm citing
statutes left and right.

198
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:52,070
And I'm doing okay.
Respectable.

199
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:56,274
But I'm just a BB gun
to these four howitzers.

200
00:17:58,278 --> 00:18:00,511
And I lose, of course.

201
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:01,579
It was inevitable.

202
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:07,452
But later, it hit me that my
boss never intended to show.

203
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:09,654
And they all laughed about it.

204
00:18:09,656 --> 00:18:12,256
They patted me on the back,
said it was my trial by fire.

205
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,892
And I laughed with them.
But, you know,

206
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:17,628
it never really
sat well with me.

207
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,931
You want them to
have your back.

208
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:24,168
Because at the end of the day, it
wasn't about proving my mettle.

209
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:28,639
My boss had a tee time
that he didn't want to miss.

210
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,477
I wasn't there long.

211
00:18:35,048 --> 00:18:39,517
Could I ask why we are here?

212
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,286
You know, I've had my
eye on you for a while.

213
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:46,224
Since that Kettleman thing. It was
an excellent deal you got for him.

214
00:18:46,226 --> 00:18:51,596
And I'm wondering why someone who
can put together a deal like that

215
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:55,666
is arguing a losing
position with no backup.

216
00:18:56,402 --> 00:18:59,370
I have no complaints about HHM.

217
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:02,273
That's great. However,

218
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:05,676
if on the off-chance
you're pondering a change,

219
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:07,378
Schweikart & Cokely
would be more than happy

220
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,881
to put your
talents to good use.

221
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:11,115
I...

222
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:12,483
Of course we'd have to have
a more formal meeting,

223
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:16,754
work out specifics, but we think
you would be a great fit.

224
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:24,762
Well, I'm flattered, but there's
clearly an ethical issue here.

225
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:27,031
Well, of course,
we'd take you off Sandpiper.

226
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:28,733
And rest assured,
we wouldn't be expecting

227
00:19:28,735 --> 00:19:31,669
any information
about HHM's strategy.

228
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:34,839
Look, we're a large,
diversified firm.

229
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:37,909
And just think what you
can do with our resources

230
00:19:37,911 --> 00:19:41,846
and the freedom to
really spread your wings.

231
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:46,851
That's...

232
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:49,820
I owe a lot to HHM.

233
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:53,558
Your tuition debt?
We could take care of that.

234
00:19:54,127 --> 00:19:56,894
That's very generous.

235
00:19:56,896 --> 00:19:59,463
Well, give it some time,
you think about it.

236
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:00,198
And you give me a call,

237
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,302
and we'll set up a meeting with
the rest of the senior partners.

238
00:20:04,604 --> 00:20:06,737
And, to be clear,

239
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:08,839
I'm talking partner track.

240
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:11,309
Jesus, Sean, did you have
to send to Moscow?

241
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:15,012
Sorry for the
wait, Mr. Schweikart.

242
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:17,615
Are we ready to order?

243
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:34,178
<i>for the gourmet Quick Chop.</i>

244
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,714
<i>It's the fastest,</i>
<i>easiest and safest way</i>

245
00:23:36,716 --> 00:23:40,551
<i>to chop, mince or dice</i>
<i>any vegetable. Guaranteed.</i>

246
00:23:40,553 --> 00:23:41,318
<i>Here's how it works.</i>

247
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,921
<i>Just place the vegetable on
the board, give it a tap,</i>

248
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:46,257
<i>and you've got finely</i>
<i>shredded cabbage in seconds.</i>

249
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:50,294
<i>For crunchy coleslaw.</i>
<i>Tap again and chop celery...</i>

250
00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:51,662
<i>for a delicious stir-fry.</i>

251
00:23:51,664 --> 00:23:54,298
<i>It even works on</i>
<i>your tougher vegetables.</i>

252
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:54,899
<i>Like potatoes.</i>

253
00:23:54,901 --> 00:23:57,368
<i>Make home fries</i>
<i>with just one tap.</i>

254
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:59,370
Get down.

255
00:23:59,372 --> 00:24:01,138
Get down.

256
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,574
<i>Quick Chop peels and chops it</i>
<i>with just a tap.</i>

257
00:24:03,576 --> 00:24:05,776
<i>Keep tapping for freshly minced garlic.

258
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:08,979
<i>The secret's the six</i>
<i>carbon steel blades,</i>

259
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:10,414
<i>combined with</i>
<i>the rotating action.</i>

260
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:14,218
<i>Each time you tap, it rotates
and chops on a different angle,</i>

261
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,152
<i>and never misses a thing.</i>

262
00:24:15,154 --> 00:24:18,355
<i>One tap, and you've got</i>
<i>sliced onions for burgers.</i>

263
00:24:18,357 --> 00:24:20,558
<i>A few more taps,</i>
<i>and you've got...</i>

264
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,493
What's the message?

265
00:24:22,595 --> 00:24:23,828
Take the $5,000.

266
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:26,730
It took two guys
to tell me that?

267
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,768
We were just supposed to scare you.
That's all.

268
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:33,370
Then try harder next time.

269
00:24:33,372 --> 00:24:35,306
Get out.
<i>It has the power to chop nuts.</i>

270
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:37,107
<i>Almonds, walnuts, pecans.</i>

271
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:40,444
<i>The Quick Chop even has
the muscle to crush ice.</i>

272
00:24:40,446 --> 00:24:41,345
Get out.

273
00:24:41,347 --> 00:24:43,280
<i>Call now and</i>
<i>you'll get Quick Chop</i>

274
00:24:43,282 --> 00:24:45,182
<i>for $14.99. But that's not all!</i>

275
00:24:45,184 --> 00:24:47,885
<i>We'll also include the grater</i>
<i>and the gripper free.</i>

276
00:24:47,887 --> 00:24:51,522
<i>Remove the blades</i>
<i>and it instantly converts...</i>

277
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:21,011
Hey, Julie. Come on in.

278
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:23,714
I've got those
Sandpiper documents.

279
00:26:23,716 --> 00:26:24,782
Great, just put them anywhere.

280
00:26:24,784 --> 00:26:27,351
Howard asked if you could
go through them now.

281
00:26:27,353 --> 00:26:29,253
It's 1:15. I was just
about to grab some lunch.

282
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:32,690
Yeah. He needs them done by
2:30 so he can draft a letter.

283
00:26:32,692 --> 00:26:36,594
I brought these. Figured I could
petty cash a lunch order for you.

284
00:26:36,596 --> 00:26:40,464
I got accounting to approve
that new fancy salad place.

285
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:00,050
Kaylee.

286
00:27:00,052 --> 00:27:04,622
Kaylee, come on.
Not too far from the side.

287
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:07,725
Throw the ball, Pop-Pop.

288
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:14,064
When are we going home?

289
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:15,866
What?

290
00:27:16,035 --> 00:27:17,901
You don't like it here?

291
00:27:18,604 --> 00:27:19,536
It's okay.

292
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:21,171
"It's okay"?

293
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:24,508
You've got a pool.
What more do you want?

294
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,909
I guess.

295
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:29,279
You guess? You guess? Well...

296
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:31,248
You want to come out of there?

297
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:31,882
No! I'm staying.

298
00:27:31,884 --> 00:27:34,585
Well, you want me to come
in there and get you?

299
00:27:34,587 --> 00:27:37,321
I can't have you in
a pool that's only "okay."

300
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:39,757
It's good! It's good!

301
00:27:43,462 --> 00:27:45,295
You sure? You sure?

302
00:27:45,297 --> 00:27:47,598
I'm sure!

303
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:30,407
Kaylee, honey,
it's time to come out now.

304
00:28:30,409 --> 00:28:31,975
Just a few more minutes!

305
00:28:31,977 --> 00:28:34,044
No. You do what Pop-Pop says.

306
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:38,382
Come on, baby, before
you turn into a prune.

307
00:30:12,845 --> 00:30:13,911
Miss?

308
00:30:13,913 --> 00:30:15,312
The gentleman
would like me to let

309
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:17,881
you know that your
next drink is on him.

310
00:30:18,684 --> 00:30:21,084
Just let me know
when you're ready.

311
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:49,413
I'm ready.

312
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:02,125
I wasn't sure that was gonna work.

313
00:31:02,127 --> 00:31:06,129
Don't tell me that's the
first time you've done that.

314
00:31:06,232 --> 00:31:07,598
So, what kind of
return on investment

315
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,300
are you getting
on these drinks?

316
00:31:11,937 --> 00:31:13,604
None as pretty as you.

317
00:31:13,606 --> 00:31:15,873
Man.

318
00:31:20,646 --> 00:31:23,280
I'm Dale, by the way.

319
00:31:23,949 --> 00:31:25,515
Giselle.

320
00:31:36,996 --> 00:31:40,497
Okay, item number 44,
what do we have?

321
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:46,136
Residency contract
for Abigail Hildreth.

322
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:53,510
"Abigail Hildreth."

323
00:31:53,979 --> 00:31:56,013
And what's the date on that?

324
00:31:56,015 --> 00:31:59,416
Dated August 1st, 1999.

325
00:31:59,985 --> 00:32:03,253
August 1st, 1999.

326
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:05,122
August 1st, 1999.

327
00:32:05,124 --> 00:32:09,493
And do we have the corresponding
deposition for Mrs. Hildreth?

328
00:32:09,495 --> 00:32:11,128
Yes.

329
00:32:26,512 --> 00:32:32,249
Have you ever heard the expression,
"A watched pot never boils"?

330
00:32:38,424 --> 00:32:39,856
Here it is.

331
00:32:39,858 --> 00:32:42,292
Thank you. See?

332
00:32:42,695 --> 00:32:45,762
I've got her down as item 12.

333
00:32:45,764 --> 00:32:48,732
Date of depo, September 15th.

334
00:32:48,968 --> 00:32:50,233
September 15th.

335
00:32:50,235 --> 00:32:53,236
Fifteenth of September.

336
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:54,404
September 15th.

337
00:32:54,406 --> 00:32:56,773
Or yeah, September 15th.

338
00:32:56,775 --> 00:33:00,444
Thank you.
Okay, item number 45.

339
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:07,351
Jimmy?

340
00:33:07,353 --> 00:33:11,588
It's my grandma. She's old.

341
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,724
I'll be right back.

342
00:33:15,394 --> 00:33:16,026
Kim?

343
00:33:16,028 --> 00:33:18,261
<i>How fast can you get downtown?</i>

344
00:33:18,263 --> 00:33:19,930
Santa Fe downtown?

345
00:33:19,932 --> 00:33:21,565
<i>Albuquerque.</i>

346
00:33:21,567 --> 00:33:22,766
Why?

347
00:33:22,768 --> 00:33:25,068
I'm at the bar at Forque.

348
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:28,438
And I've got a live one on the hook.

349
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:34,644
I'm on my way. What's the shot?

350
00:33:34,713 --> 00:33:36,046
Definitely two or three.

351
00:33:36,048 --> 00:33:39,016
You don't think they do?
They could.

352
00:33:39,018 --> 00:33:41,685
I know,
but they don't have to.

353
00:33:43,756 --> 00:33:47,724
That's possible, but I don't
understand why that's an issue.

354
00:33:47,726 --> 00:33:48,959
You can always go back.

355
00:33:48,961 --> 00:33:50,160
Yeah. Yeah.

356
00:33:52,898 --> 00:33:54,097
Viktor! There you are!

357
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:56,433
So sorry I'm late.
I had to put out a few fires.

358
00:33:56,435 --> 00:33:58,101
No problem.
I made a new friend.

359
00:33:58,103 --> 00:33:59,770
Dale, my brother Viktor.
Hey, how you doing?

360
00:33:59,772 --> 00:34:02,806
Nice to meet you, Dale. Thanks
for keeping sis company.

361
00:34:02,808 --> 00:34:03,673
My pleasure.

362
00:34:03,675 --> 00:34:07,611
You need a drink.
Let's get you a drink.

363
00:34:08,647 --> 00:34:10,113
So, what do you do, Dale?

364
00:34:10,115 --> 00:34:12,015
I'm an engineer.

365
00:34:12,451 --> 00:34:14,684
Like Casey Jones, with the hat?

366
00:34:14,686 --> 00:34:18,021
No, idiot.
An engineer-engineer.

367
00:34:18,023 --> 00:34:19,423
Not an "engineer."
Dale builds things.

368
00:34:19,425 --> 00:34:22,759
I design things. Spillways
and drainage fields, mostly.

369
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:24,461
I don't actually build them.

370
00:34:24,463 --> 00:34:25,328
Well, that's cool. Yeah.

371
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:29,866
But you could still wear the hat, though.
Right? Nothing stopping you.

372
00:34:29,868 --> 00:34:30,567
Yeah, I guess I could.

373
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:32,769
I'm just saying there's no rule
about that, as far as I know.

374
00:34:32,771 --> 00:34:35,839
You are such a brat!
Why the good mood?

375
00:34:35,841 --> 00:34:38,275
Did it go well today?

376
00:34:38,277 --> 00:34:40,444
Please tell me it went well.

377
00:34:40,446 --> 00:34:42,712
Yeah, it went well.

378
00:34:43,182 --> 00:34:46,083
Very well? Like, very, very?

379
00:34:46,085 --> 00:34:49,319
Beyond our wildest... Yeah.

380
00:34:49,321 --> 00:34:51,388
Whoo!

381
00:34:51,523 --> 00:34:53,657
How many of these has she had?

382
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:55,859
I'm just
getting started, baby!

383
00:34:55,861 --> 00:34:56,793
Remember these faces, Dale!
Giselle.

384
00:34:56,795 --> 00:34:59,529
They're gonna be on the cover of
<i>Fortune Magazine,</i> January issue.

385
00:34:59,531 --> 00:35:00,764
Giselle. Please.
Dale's a good guy.

386
00:35:00,766 --> 00:35:02,766
He's not gonna do anything.
You're boring the man.

387
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:04,468
No, no, not really.

388
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:05,969
Thank you.

389
00:35:05,971 --> 00:35:08,472
All right, I'm off to
the little girl's room.

390
00:35:08,474 --> 00:35:12,976
Say only nice things about me
while I'm gone, okay?

391
00:35:16,915 --> 00:35:19,116
She's something.

392
00:35:19,485 --> 00:35:20,817
Yeah.

393
00:35:23,388 --> 00:35:27,824
So, Giselle was telling me you
two are starting a business?

394
00:35:29,261 --> 00:35:31,394
What exactly did she tell you?

395
00:35:31,396 --> 00:35:33,997
Nothing much.
Just something about a dotcom.

396
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:39,369
Some way for people to hook up with
each other using the Internet?

397
00:35:40,105 --> 00:35:41,972
Look, I'm sure
you're a nice guy,

398
00:35:41,974 --> 00:35:44,841
but she was
talking out of school.

399
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:47,177
We're full up on this thing.

400
00:35:47,179 --> 00:35:47,744
Okay.

401
00:35:47,746 --> 00:35:51,114
We sign one more investor,
we gotta go public.

402
00:35:51,116 --> 00:35:54,251
And I'm just... No.

403
00:35:54,253 --> 00:35:57,854
We cannot take anyone else on.

404
00:35:57,856 --> 00:35:59,055
No offense.

405
00:35:59,057 --> 00:36:01,224
It's okay. Yeah.

406
00:36:04,263 --> 00:36:06,129
No worries.

407
00:37:00,419 --> 00:37:02,519
Spread your arms.

408
00:37:13,799 --> 00:37:15,298
No.

409
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,536
He's got a gun.

410
00:37:19,538 --> 00:37:22,405
I don't care about the gun.

411
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:19,629
Tomorrow, you go to
the district attorney.

412
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:24,868
And you explain to him that
my nephew's gun was yours.

413
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:29,773
The DA will ask you, "Why you
didn't say anything before?"

414
00:38:29,775 --> 00:38:33,276
You tell him you forgot.
You were rattled.

415
00:38:33,278 --> 00:38:36,780
Make up anything you want,
I don't give a shit.

416
00:38:36,782 --> 00:38:39,015
But it's your gun.

417
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:43,386
Let's discuss my payment.

418
00:38:43,388 --> 00:38:47,724
That time has passed.
No $5,000 for you.

419
00:38:47,726 --> 00:38:49,225
The price is $50,000.

420
00:38:49,227 --> 00:38:52,595
How about your
payment is you get to live?

421
00:38:53,165 --> 00:38:54,564
Not enough.

422
00:38:54,566 --> 00:38:57,267
You think you can
negotiate with me?

423
00:38:57,269 --> 00:39:01,805
I say the word, my nephews
go to a certain motel.

424
00:39:01,807 --> 00:39:04,140
Pay a visit to
your daughter-in-law

425
00:39:04,142 --> 00:39:06,943
and your little granddaughter.

426
00:39:06,945 --> 00:39:09,479
What do you think happens then?

427
00:39:09,981 --> 00:39:14,184
Consider your
position carefully.

428
00:39:15,087 --> 00:39:17,220
I get my money,

429
00:39:17,222 --> 00:39:20,323
or neither of us
walk out of here.

430
00:39:29,668 --> 00:39:33,136
You're willing to die for this?

431
00:39:34,606 --> 00:39:38,908
Maybe I need the $50,000
more than you do.

432
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:56,693
How you manage to live so
long with a mouth like that?

433
00:40:01,366 --> 00:40:03,433
$50,000.

434
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:08,104
And the gun is yours.

435
00:40:47,212 --> 00:40:48,178
He sent you?

436
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,846
I volunteered.

437
00:40:50,182 --> 00:40:53,082
Only safe way for us to talk.

438
00:41:10,469 --> 00:41:13,470
You really pushed it in there.

439
00:41:16,908 --> 00:41:19,275
That thing we did?

440
00:41:19,678 --> 00:41:22,979
He finds out, we're both dead.

441
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:25,081
You get that, right?

442
00:41:25,517 --> 00:41:27,750
What thing we did?

443
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:35,225
What's this? $25,000.

444
00:41:35,227 --> 00:41:36,526
What for?

445
00:41:36,528 --> 00:41:40,730
We made a deal.
I didn't hold up my end.

446
00:41:41,533 --> 00:41:46,436
Your problem is coming back
sooner than we expected.

447
00:42:03,288 --> 00:42:08,258
You gonna cash that? I might
know a guy who can help.

448
00:42:08,593 --> 00:42:11,194
It's better as a souvenir.

449
00:42:11,263 --> 00:42:15,231
I figured you'd be,
maybe, I don't know,

450
00:42:15,233 --> 00:42:17,233
a touch happier this morning.

451
00:42:17,235 --> 00:42:19,502
Maybe a smidge? Possibly?

452
00:42:19,504 --> 00:42:22,305
I am. I'm totally happy.

453
00:42:22,507 --> 00:42:24,974
Why wouldn't I be?

454
00:42:26,011 --> 00:42:27,644
I...

455
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,814
I had a job offer.

456
00:42:31,917 --> 00:42:34,484
Really? From where?

457
00:42:34,486 --> 00:42:37,020
Schweikart & Cokely.

458
00:42:37,255 --> 00:42:38,087
Seriously?

459
00:42:38,089 --> 00:42:39,656
Rich Schweikart
said that they would

460
00:42:39,658 --> 00:42:42,392
even pay off my
law school loans.

461
00:42:42,394 --> 00:42:43,393
That's great!

462
00:42:43,395 --> 00:42:46,195
Please let me be there
when you tell Howard.

463
00:42:46,197 --> 00:42:47,830
Please.

464
00:42:47,933 --> 00:42:49,532
So why the sad puppy eyes?

465
00:42:49,534 --> 00:42:50,867
What, you don't want that job?

466
00:42:50,869 --> 00:42:53,703
No, no, of course I do.
I mean, who wouldn't, right?

467
00:42:53,705 --> 00:42:57,373
It's a huge firm. You get
out from under Howard's thumb.

468
00:42:57,375 --> 00:42:58,174
Right. Exactly.

469
00:42:58,176 --> 00:43:03,079
Besides, HHM is looking more and
more like a dead end for me anyway.

470
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:06,115
Exactly. So what's the problem?

471
00:43:07,285 --> 00:43:09,052
I just...

472
00:43:13,892 --> 00:43:15,592
I don't know.

473
00:43:15,594 --> 00:43:19,429
I keep thinking of you
floating in that pool.

474
00:43:20,231 --> 00:43:24,767
You knew what you wanted,
but I got in the way.

475
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:26,970
What are you talking about?

476
00:43:26,972 --> 00:43:30,974
You took the Davis &
Main job because of me.

477
00:43:30,976 --> 00:43:34,143
I took that job because it
was the right decision.

478
00:43:34,145 --> 00:43:35,745
A steady pay check? Done.

479
00:43:35,747 --> 00:43:40,049
A place to live that's more than,
five square feet? Boom.

480
00:43:40,051 --> 00:43:42,385
A car that's all one color?
Nailed it.

481
00:43:42,387 --> 00:43:46,556
I'm good.
I got what I wanted.

482
00:43:46,558 --> 00:43:48,157
And you?
With this Schweikart thing?

483
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:50,927
You could have
everything you ever wanted.

484
00:43:50,929 --> 00:43:53,663
What's not to love about that?

485
00:43:55,166 --> 00:43:58,501
Yeah. What's not to love?
