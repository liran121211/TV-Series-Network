He said you should save
your money and get a new car.

368
00:22:59,121 --> 00:23:02,422
Yeah? Well, it has a sentimental value.

370
00:23:05,994 --> 00:23:09,262

00:23:13,468 --> 00:23:15,335
Um, what material do you want?

373
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:18,671
Well, I was thinking leather, definitely.

374
00:23:18,707 --> 00:23:21,774
Uh, maybe alligator.

[Chuckles] Señor. Too much money.

378
00:23:27,983 --> 00:23:30,850
Yeah, but like I said,
it has a sentimental value.

gonna look all wrong.

Why are you here?

399
00:24:45,446 --> 00:24:47,780
Baseball cards.

400
00:24:47,815 --> 00:24:51,850
The way I figure, you saw that
mid-life crisis of a vehicle

401
00:24:51,886 --> 00:24:53,852
and wisely decided
‭to cut ties with the man,

402
00:24:53,888 --> 00:24:56,088
and I don't blame you... I did, too.

403
00:24:56,123 --> 00:24:57,856
And then you ripped him off.

404
00:24:57,892 --> 00:25:00,326
And I'm sure those baseball cards

405
00:25:00,361 --> 00:25:02,528
looked like an easy way
to make a few extra bucks

406
00:25:02,563 --> 00:25:05,297
off that idiot, teach him a lesson, too.

407
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:06,965
But you underestimated

408
00:25:07,001 --> 00:25:09,301
just how big an idiot
you were dealing with.

409
00:25:09,337 --> 00:25:12,438
[Chuckles] No, I am pretty aware.

410
00:25:12,473 --> 00:25:13,939
Well, then, you underestimated

411
00:25:13,974 --> 00:25:15,541
how attached the man was to those cards...

412
00:25:15,576 --> 00:25:20,012
so attached, he called the police
and reported them stolen.

413
00:25:20,047 --> 00:25:21,847
Now they're nosing around.

414
00:25:23,584 --> 00:25:26,352
That sounds like a "you" problem.

415
00:25:26,387 --> 00:25:28,520
No, I think it's very much an "us" problem.

416
00:25:28,556 --> 00:25:30,723
Yeah, I guess I'll just
have to take my chances.

417
00:25:30,758 --> 00:25:32,891
But [Whistles] Good luck to you.

418
00:25:32,927 --> 00:25:34,693
You know, I was hoping
you'd see our dilemma

419
00:25:34,729 --> 00:25:36,328
and do the right thing.

420
00:25:36,364 --> 00:25:38,130
But I think what we have here now

421
00:25:38,165 --> 00:25:41,066
is a carrot-and-stick situation.

422
00:25:41,102 --> 00:25:44,036
Oh, yeah?

423
00:25:44,071 --> 00:25:47,306
This the stick? Hmm?

424
00:25:47,341 --> 00:25:50,409
You coming here, threatening my family?

425
00:25:50,444 --> 00:25:52,177
Huh?

426
00:25:52,213 --> 00:25:55,080
'Cause you're gonna need
a bigger stick, old man.

427
00:26:00,054 --> 00:26:02,888
I'm not here to threaten your family.

428
00:26:04,392 --> 00:26:08,026
And the name of the stick
is Tuco Salamanca.

429
00:26:08,062 --> 00:26:12,731
Now, you don't play ball, so to speak,

430
00:26:12,767 --> 00:26:16,602
and Tuco finds out about
your little side business.

431
00:26:16,637 --> 00:26:19,238
That a big enough stick?

432
00:26:21,709 --> 00:26:25,911
However, I prefer the carrot.

433
00:26:25,946 --> 00:26:28,247
I think you will, too.

434
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,450
And what would that be?

435
00:26:31,485 --> 00:26:35,421
You give me back the baseball cards,

436
00:26:35,456 --> 00:26:37,523
$10,000 in cash,

437
00:26:37,558 --> 00:26:44,163
and you net roughly... roughly... $60,000.

438

[Chuckles]

439
00:26:47,501 --> 00:26:50,569

So...

448
00:28:00,404 --> 00:28:02,884
and you got to go with the premium gas.

449
00:28:03,166 --> 00:28:07,201
I know it seems like a scam,
but it makes a huge difference.

450
00:28:07,236 --> 00:28:09,920
And I would get her washed
at least once a week.

451
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,486
And spring for the hand wax.

452
00:28:11,522 --> 00:28:14,056

extra layer of protection

No.

driving that thing?

00:35:14,397 --> 00:35:16,096
that the officers took at the scene,

548
00:35:16,132 --> 00:35:18,632
and we have a few
‭small follow-up questions.

549
00:35:18,668 --> 00:35:21,368
Uh, sorry to waste your time.
Just standard stuff.

550
00:35:21,404 --> 00:35:23,103
There's really no need
for a lawyer to be here.

551
00:35:23,139 --> 00:35:25,906
I'm here in more of an advisory capacity.

552
00:35:25,942 --> 00:35:29,076
Dan just, uh, wanted
a friendly face next to him.

553
00:35:29,111 --> 00:35:31,412
Coleman: ‭Well, we're all friendly here.

554
00:35:31,447 --> 00:35:33,914
Look at us. Four friends.

555
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:34,717
[Chuckles]

556
00:35:34,717 --> 00:35:36,316
We just want to get the facts straight

557
00:35:36,352 --> 00:35:38,652
so we can, um, help you get
your property for you.

558
00:35:38,687 --> 00:35:40,721
Yeah, you know, uh, it's fine.

559
00:35:40,756 --> 00:35:43,790
Uh, yeah, there's no need to, uh...

560
00:35:43,826 --> 00:35:45,826
No, it's just standard procedure.

561
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:47,800
You know, ‭officers don't always get

562
00:35:47,835 --> 00:35:50,169
all the information we
need in their report.

563
00:35:50,203 --> 00:35:53,104
We just want to find the guys
who took your baseball cards.

564
00:35:53,139 --> 00:35:55,773
Yeah, that's, uh...

565
00:35:55,809 --> 00:35:58,509
You know, my uncle
‭had a Ty Cobb tobacco card.

566
00:35:58,545 --> 00:36:01,579
Kept that thing behind six inches of glass

567
00:36:01,614 --> 00:36:03,314
like it was the Mona Lisa or something.

568
00:36:03,349 --> 00:36:05,349
Wow. Ty Cobb?

569
00:36:05,385 --> 00:36:06,784
Tell him to keep the lights low.

570
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:09,120
Even artificial lighting
has a certain amount

571
00:36:09,155 --> 00:36:14,121
of ultraviolet radiation
that can, uh, you know...

572
00:36:14,122 --> 00:36:15,621
- Over the long term...
- Yeah.

573
00:36:15,657 --> 00:36:17,924
Um, can you just remind us

574
00:36:17,959 --> 00:36:20,893
exactly where you kept
your cards in the house?

575
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:25,631
Yeah, well, uh, as I was trying
to say, it's no longer an issue.

576
00:36:25,667 --> 00:36:28,334
I found them.

577
00:36:28,865 --> 00:36:30,298
So you found the cards?

578
00:36:30,334 --> 00:36:32,004
Uh, yep.

579
00:36:32,005 --> 00:36:36,941
I just wanted to come down and
tell you, you know, in person.

580
00:36:36,976 --> 00:36:38,743
You found them?

581
00:36:38,778 --> 00:36:40,478
Where? Around the house?

582
00:36:40,513 --> 00:36:43,748
No. I, uh, I hired a private investigator,

583
00:36:43,783 --> 00:36:45,917
and he tracked them down.

584
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:47,318
So, yeah.

585
00:36:47,353 --> 00:36:50,827
Really? So, where were they?

586
00:36:50,828 --> 00:36:53,156
You know, it's fine. It is.

587
00:36:53,223 --> 00:36:55,630
I really... I ought to
get out of your hair.

588
00:36:55,666 --> 00:36:58,300
Uh, you've wasted enough time on me.

589
00:36:58,335 --> 00:37:01,136
No, no, it's... ‭it's okay. It's our job.

590
00:37:02,013 --> 00:37:03,188
We just want to get the facts right

591
00:37:03,213 --> 00:37:05,854
so we can help close this case for you.

592
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,567
It's done.

593
00:37:08,602 --> 00:37:10,836
Case closed!

594
00:37:10,871 --> 00:37:13,083
I just... I know how much, you know,

595
00:37:13,084 --> 00:37:14,751
you guys have on your hands,

596
00:37:14,798 --> 00:37:18,333
like murderers and robbers
and gangs and stuff. I...

597
00:37:18,368 --> 00:37:21,505
Hey, Danny, ‭why don't you get some air?

598
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:22,805
You can have some coffee.

599
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,441
I'll finish up ‭with the detectives here.

600
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:36,418
Okay, let's get down
to brass tacks here, guys.

601
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:39,655
I'm guessing your two
fine uniformed officers

602
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:41,590
found Mr. Wormald's little hidey hole,

603
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:43,659
and that's why you two are so interested

604
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:45,352
in "helping" my friend here.

605
00:37:45,352 --> 00:37:46,888
I get it.

606
00:37:46,888 --> 00:37:48,885
A hiding place in the baseboard...

607
00:37:49,178 --> 00:37:50,666
it's gonna make anyone suspicious.

608
00:37:50,691 --> 00:37:54,193
But let me assure you there's
nothing illegal going on here.

609
00:37:54,818 --> 00:37:56,342
Then why is he so nervous?

610
00:37:56,342 --> 00:37:59,109
Mm-hmm. 'Cause I must say, the
flop sweat is kind of suspect.

611
00:37:59,144 --> 00:38:02,111
We all have our secrets, don't we?

612
00:38:02,147 --> 00:38:04,481
And who among us is without sin?

613
00:38:04,522 --> 00:38:08,053
But those sins aren't all
of the criminal variety,

614
00:38:08,078 --> 00:38:10,545
and neither are Mr. Wormald's, okay?

615
00:38:11,056 --> 00:38:13,223
They are, however, very private.

616
00:38:13,258 --> 00:38:15,492
Private, like drug dealer, maybe?

617
00:38:15,527 --> 00:38:17,021
No, no!

618
00:38:17,022 --> 00:38:19,589
He's being evasive because
it's a sensitive subject,

619
00:38:19,624 --> 00:38:23,560
very delicate, and of no concern
to law enforcement.

620
00:38:23,595 --> 00:38:27,168
You know, as much as we'd love
to, um, take your word for it,

621
00:38:27,193 --> 00:38:28,665
we're gonna need a little more than that.

622
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:32,669
All right, well, this all comes
down to a personal dispute.

623
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:34,037
That's all.

624
00:38:34,072 --> 00:38:36,977
It's... it's between, um, Mr. Wormald

625
00:38:37,002 --> 00:38:41,811
and, uh... his art patron.

626
00:38:43,563 --> 00:38:44,381
- "Art patron"?
- Yeah.

627
00:38:44,416 --> 00:38:50,057
Uh, my client has an arrangement
with a wealthy gentleman

628
00:38:50,557 --> 00:38:54,090
for whom [clears throat]
Mr. Wormald provides...

629
00:38:55,484 --> 00:39:00,096
Art in exchange for
‭this gentleman's generous, uh...

630
00:39:00,132 --> 00:39:03,266
We'll call it patronage.

631
00:39:03,301 --> 00:39:06,436
Art? Like... like what? Paintings?

632
00:39:06,471 --> 00:39:09,239
It's more like digital media.

633
00:39:09,274 --> 00:39:11,541
Digital media?

634
00:39:11,576 --> 00:39:14,051
He made videos for the man.

635
00:39:14,115 --> 00:39:15,324
What kind of videos?

636
00:39:15,514 --> 00:39:18,314
Private videos of an artistic nature.

637
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:20,483
That's what was in the hiding place.

638
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:22,152
That's what it's for.

639
00:39:24,423 --> 00:39:29,259
So, this art patron stole the
videos and the baseball cards?

640
00:39:29,294 --> 00:39:31,294
Well, there was a misunderstanding.

641
00:39:31,329 --> 00:39:33,830
I mean, uh, ‭call it creative differences.

642
00:39:33,865 --> 00:39:36,599
Artists are volatile creatures.

643
00:39:36,635 --> 00:39:38,168
[Sighs]

644
00:39:38,203 --> 00:39:42,838
Guys, this all comes down
to just a lovers' spat, okay?

645
00:39:42,863 --> 00:39:46,311
Two consenting adults had a falling out.

646
00:39:46,336 --> 00:39:47,076
That happens.

647
00:39:47,112 --> 00:39:50,513
And the, uh, "patron" stole the videos

648
00:39:50,549 --> 00:39:53,283
and the baseball cards, uh,
to "make a point," I guess.

649
00:39:53,318 --> 00:39:56,586
But the headline here is, it's all settled.

650
00:39:56,621 --> 00:39:57,921
Hearts have mended,

651
00:39:57,956 --> 00:40:01,791
and Mr. Wormald will not
be pressing charges.

652
00:40:01,827 --> 00:40:05,195
What was on these videos?

653
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:07,831
- They were private.
- You've said that.

654
00:40:07,866 --> 00:40:09,299
[Sighs]

655
00:40:09,334 --> 00:40:16,240
They were videos intended
to titillate the senses.

656
00:40:16,975 --> 00:40:19,476
- Okay, so porn.
- Not... no.

657
00:40:19,511 --> 00:40:21,211
Not as such.

658
00:40:21,246 --> 00:40:24,681
Technically, they would be
categorized as fetish videos.

659
00:40:24,716 --> 00:40:26,516
But nothing illegal.

660
00:40:26,551 --> 00:40:29,319
Just a man... a fully
clothed man, I might add...

661
00:40:29,354 --> 00:40:31,787
just all by himself.

662
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:37,827
Just... just Mr. Wormald
fully clothed, uh, yeah.

663
00:40:37,863 --> 00:40:40,697
So... all right.

664
00:40:40,732 --> 00:40:48,491
So, fully clothed Mr. Wormald
by himself doing what?

665
00:40:48,533 --> 00:40:49,965
Yeah, come on, man. What?

666
00:40:51,543 --> 00:40:55,044
[Sighs] Squat cobbler.

667
00:40:56,349 --> 00:40:58,648
What's a s-squat cobbler?

668
00:40:58,683 --> 00:41:01,050
Squat cobbler.
‭You know what squat cobbler is.

669
00:41:01,086 --> 00:41:02,886
No, I don't... I don't know
what a squat cobbler is.

670
00:41:02,921 --> 00:41:05,321
No, me neither. What is it?

671
00:41:05,357 --> 00:41:07,390
What? And you two guys are cops?

672
00:41:07,425 --> 00:41:11,027
Hoboken squat cobbler.

673
00:41:11,062 --> 00:41:13,596
Full moon moon-pie.

674
00:41:13,632 --> 00:41:17,367
Boston cream splat. [Chuckles]

675
00:41:17,402 --> 00:41:18,601
Seriously?

676
00:41:18,637 --> 00:41:21,437
Simple-Simon-the-ass-man.

677
00:41:21,473 --> 00:41:23,168
Dutch apple ass.

678
00:41:23,168 --> 00:41:26,202
Guys, am I not speaking English here?

679
00:41:26,236 --> 00:41:27,702
What the hell is a squat cobbler?!

680
00:41:27,738 --> 00:41:29,604
It's when a man sits in pie!

681
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,507
He sits in a pie!

682
00:41:32,543 --> 00:41:36,211
And he... he wiggles around.

683
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:39,681
Maybe it's like hellmann's mayonnaise.

684
00:41:39,716 --> 00:41:41,883
It has a different name
west of the rockies.

685
00:41:41,919 --> 00:41:43,685
I don't know. But, uh, technically,

686
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:46,555
he does a crybaby squat, so there's tears,

687
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:48,623
which makes it more specialized.

688
00:41:48,659 --> 00:41:50,725
Not all pie sitters cry.

689
00:41:50,761 --> 00:41:52,327
But I'm gonna tell you something.

690
00:41:52,362 --> 00:41:54,952
This guy is a regular Julianne Moore

691
00:41:54,977 --> 00:41:56,709
once he gets ‭the waterworks cranked up.

692
00:41:56,733 --> 00:41:58,667
Pies?

693
00:41:58,702 --> 00:42:00,001
What? Like apple?

694
00:42:00,037 --> 00:42:01,703
Guys, I'm not ‭the
filmmaker here, all right?

695
00:42:01,738 --> 00:42:05,978
Banana cream. I... uh, peach.

696
00:42:05,978 --> 00:42:09,480
Oh, and there... And there
is a costume involved.

697
00:42:09,516 --> 00:42:12,183
[Snorts]

698
00:42:12,219 --> 00:42:14,386
You got to be shitting us.

699
00:42:14,421 --> 00:42:17,822
Yeah, like I would make this up.

700
00:42:17,858 --> 00:42:22,227
Hey, the world is
‭a rich tapestry, my friends.

701
00:42:23,597 --> 00:42:24,963
But trust me on this.

702
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,270
You don't want to see it.

703
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:28,703
[Chuckles]

704
00:42:34,878 --> 00:42:37,979
So, uh, we're good, right?

705
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:41,385
Yeah. Great. [Chuckles]

706
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:44,185
There is, however, one little,
tiny hanging Chad.

707
00:42:44,221 --> 00:42:46,221
Well, what? What Chad?

708
00:42:46,256 --> 00:42:48,289
You're gonna have to make a video.

709
00:42:50,894 --> 00:42:53,094
[Keys jingle]

710
00:42:53,129 --> 00:42:55,630
[Insects chirping]

711
00:43:01,738 --> 00:43:04,238
[Grunts]

712
00:43:11,781 --> 00:43:14,115
Kim: [Laughs] Wait. Wait.

713
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:16,834
So he eats the pies or just sits in them?

714
00:43:16,834 --> 00:43:19,001
Both. Whatever you want.

715
00:43:19,036 --> 00:43:20,836
Which comes first?

716
00:43:20,871 --> 00:43:22,671
Uh, it's dealer's choice.

717
00:43:23,624 --> 00:43:25,038
That's where the crying comes in, right?

718
00:43:25,211 --> 00:43:26,609
That's a safe bet.

719
00:43:26,644 --> 00:43:28,010
[Laughs]

720
00:43:28,812 --> 00:43:30,524
How the hell ‭did you come up with that?

721
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:32,457
If you gave me a million years,

722
00:43:32,493 --> 00:43:34,159
I still would not have come up with that.

723
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:35,227
The muse.

724
00:43:35,262 --> 00:43:36,762
She speaks through me.

725
00:43:36,797 --> 00:43:38,897
I am but a humble vessel.

726
00:43:38,933 --> 00:43:40,165
And they bought it?

727
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,539
- Yeah.
- Wow.

728
00:43:41,539 --> 00:43:43,594
I've heard some far-out
scenarios used to sow doubt,

729
00:43:43,619 --> 00:43:44,907
but this definitely takes the cake.

730
00:43:44,942 --> 00:43:47,076
Kim, Kim, Kim.

731
00:43:47,602 --> 00:43:48,735
- Takes the pie.
- Yeah.

732
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:50,017
[Chuckling] Sorry.

733
00:43:50,018 --> 00:43:51,684
I should just jump off the roof right now.

734
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,254
Yeah, you should feel bad about yourself.

735
00:43:54,289 --> 00:43:56,523
Jesus, can you tell a story.

736
00:43:57,291 --> 00:44:01,361
Well, to be fair, I think it was
the video that clinched it.

737
00:44:01,396 --> 00:44:03,630
What video?

738
00:44:04,604 --> 00:44:06,964
Wait, wait. You...
‭You actually made a video?

739
00:44:06,964 --> 00:44:09,722
I got to say, in the end,
ol' Dan really committed.

740
00:44:09,722 --> 00:44:12,156
I believed the tears.

741
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:16,994
Um, this is a leftover prop. It was extra.

742
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:20,531
I wasn't sure how many takes
we would need, so I over-bought,

743
00:44:20,566 --> 00:44:24,535
but I promise you,
‭untouched by human buttocks.

744
00:44:25,527 --> 00:44:27,271
You fabricated evidence?

745
00:44:27,306 --> 00:44:29,039
I made a video.

746
00:44:29,075 --> 00:44:30,708
Not exactly evidence.

747
00:44:30,743 --> 00:44:32,343
You used it to exonerate a client.

748
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:36,447
You used falsified evidence
to exonerate a client.

749
00:44:36,482 --> 00:44:38,760
Mm, I think you're splitting hairs.

750
00:44:38,785 --> 00:44:40,105
I'm not splitting hairs.

751
00:44:40,372 --> 00:44:43,854
What if Davis & Main find out
you faked evidence?

752
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:45,622
It wasn't a Davis & Main client.

753
00:44:45,658 --> 00:44:48,359
It was some nothing, little pro-bono thing.

754
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:50,494
It was off the clock. It was,
uh, totally my own thing.

755
00:44:50,529 --> 00:44:51,562
Why?

756
00:44:53,977 --> 00:44:56,533
Why would you risk
‭the best job you've ever had

757
00:44:56,569 --> 00:44:58,502
for some pro-bono case?

758
00:44:58,537 --> 00:45:00,371
I was doing a favor for a friend.

759
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:03,307
Risking disbarment?
That's... that's some friend.

760
00:45:03,342 --> 00:45:05,809
It's fine! It... it worked out.

761
00:45:05,845 --> 00:45:07,678
Davis & Main are none the wiser.

762
00:45:07,713 --> 00:45:09,546
Jimmy, ‭you're playing with fire here.

763
00:45:10,295 --> 00:45:12,048
I didn't see you complaining

764
00:45:12,048 --> 00:45:15,316
when, um, Ken the douchebag paid
our bar bill the other night.

765
00:45:15,352 --> 00:45:18,053
No, that was a little bit
of rule breaking right there.

766
00:45:18,088 --> 00:45:20,689
And if I remember correctly, you liked it.

767
00:45:20,724 --> 00:45:21,990
A lot.

768
00:45:22,025 --> 00:45:24,326
That is so not the same thing.

769
00:45:24,361 --> 00:45:25,760
How? What's the difference?

770
00:45:25,796 --> 00:45:27,329
That had nothing to do with work.

771
00:45:27,364 --> 00:45:30,332
And we were just... just screwing around.

772
00:45:30,367 --> 00:45:31,367
This?

773
00:45:32,375 --> 00:45:34,236
Fabricating evidence.

774
00:45:34,271 --> 00:45:36,171
Jimmy, ‭this could really hurt you.

775
00:45:36,206 --> 00:45:38,073
If they find out, if you get caught...

776
00:45:38,108 --> 00:45:40,175
It... they're never gonna find out.

777
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:42,510
Seriously? You sound like
every dumb criminal out there.

778
00:45:42,546 --> 00:45:45,113
If you keep this up, they will find out.

779
00:45:46,703 --> 00:45:48,934
- For what, Jimmy?
- ‭[Sighs]

780
00:45:51,054 --> 00:45:53,255
What is the point?

781
00:45:58,061 --> 00:46:00,896
[Clears throat]

782
00:46:09,473 --> 00:46:12,241
I cannot hear ‭about this sort of thing.

783
00:46:13,277 --> 00:46:15,496
Ever again. Okay?

784
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:22,517
I mean it, Jimmy.

785
00:46:24,487 --> 00:46:26,420
You won't.

786
00:46:31,645 --> 00:46:36,745
