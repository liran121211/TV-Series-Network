1
00:00:28,662 --> 00:00:32,398
Jimmy?
How's that sweeping going?

2
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,866
Goin' good, Pop!

3
00:00:37,071 --> 00:00:37,703
Hi. How are you?

4
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:41,573
Hello, sir. I was wondering
if, maybe, you could help me?

5
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:42,075
Yeah?

6
00:00:42,076 --> 00:00:46,145
Well, I drove
into the city this morning...

7
00:00:46,147 --> 00:00:47,679
Usually, I take the train,

8
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:49,148
but I was just in
such a rush to get

9
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,350
some medicine for
my son, Freddie.

10
00:00:51,352 --> 00:00:54,253
He has epilepsy.

11
00:00:54,255 --> 00:00:55,954
He had an attack this morning,

12
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:56,555
but during his fit,

13
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:59,324
he knocked the bottle of
medicine out of my wife's hand.

14
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:03,262
It just...
Bam, one huge puddle.

15
00:01:03,264 --> 00:01:04,229
That's terrible.

16
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:06,432
But long story short,
I drove into town,

17
00:01:06,434 --> 00:01:10,869
I bought the new medicine with
every last nickel in my pocket,

18
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:13,172
and then my car died.

19
00:01:13,174 --> 00:01:14,106
God, that's just...

20
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:17,309
I know. When it rains,
it pours, right?

21
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:22,748
I tried the ignition, just nothing.
Not firing.

22
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:27,019
Anyway,
now I've convinced myself

23
00:01:27,021 --> 00:01:28,821
that Freddie is gonna have
another seizure

24
00:01:28,823 --> 00:01:31,523
before I get back
with the medicine.

25
00:01:31,525 --> 00:01:35,561
So, if you can help me,
I'd be so grateful...

26
00:01:35,563 --> 00:01:39,131
Well, I can come out
and check your car for you.

27
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:40,299
Maybe it's just a spark plug.

28
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:43,001
I got a box of plugs
back in the stockroom.

29
00:01:43,003 --> 00:01:45,604
Thanks, and I appreciate that,

30
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:48,140
but if you could possibly
just spare $5 instead?

31
00:01:48,142 --> 00:01:53,545
I'd rather grab a cab than take
a chance with my old clunker.

32
00:01:53,848 --> 00:01:55,514
Yeah. $5?

33
00:01:55,516 --> 00:01:57,416
If you can spare it.

34
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:04,223
Yeah, okay. Sure.

35
00:02:04,225 --> 00:02:06,091
Psst!

36
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:08,327
Dad. C'mere!

37
00:02:09,063 --> 00:02:10,596
C'mere!

38
00:02:14,168 --> 00:02:16,668
Dad, it's a rip-off!

39
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,737
Just like that
bum from last week.

40
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:19,171
Jimmy...

41
00:02:19,173 --> 00:02:20,439
Every grifter in
town knows that

42
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:22,741
this is the spot to come
for an easy handout.

43
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:24,510
"Grifter"? Where in the world
did you learn that word?

44
00:02:24,512 --> 00:02:29,982
Dad. His story is baloney. He
probably doesn't even have a son.

45
00:02:29,984 --> 00:02:32,184
He's conning you.

46
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,321
Jimmy, what if you're wrong?

47
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:38,457
You know what?

48
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:41,326
I'm sorry to bother you folks.

49
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:42,895
I'm gonna get outta here...
I'm...

50
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:44,296
No, no, no.

51
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:46,064
Dad... No, no bother.

52
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:47,566
Come on, no. Here.

53
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:52,838
Here $10 for you.

54
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,908
Sir, you're...

55
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,544
That's... That is so generous.

56
00:02:58,546 --> 00:03:01,947
Of course, and you know what? I'm
gonna go back in the stockroom,

57
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:02,814
I'm gonna find
those spark plugs,

58
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:04,650
and we will get your car
started for you, okay?

59
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:06,952
Come on, Jimmy,
just man the till, okay,

60
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:10,122
and I'll just be back in a jiff.
Okay?

61
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:20,832
How much for a carton of Kools?

62
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:22,401
4 bucks.

63
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:24,736
Yeah, gimme a carton.

64
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:27,105
Money first.

65
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:44,056
Gimme two cartons.

66
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:48,794
Gosh, those spark
plugs are back here somewhere.

67
00:03:48,796 --> 00:03:51,697
Just gimme one
more minute, okay?

68
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,470
Come on.

69
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,989
There are wolves and sheep
in this world, kid.

70
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:22,661
Wolves and sheep. Figure out
which one you're gonna be.

71
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:37,809
Okay, I found the...

72
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:40,679
Did he leave?

73
00:04:41,215 --> 00:04:43,448
Did he just leave?

74
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:46,184
Sir?

75
00:05:46,914 --> 00:05:48,380
Don't let me interrupt.

76
00:05:48,382 --> 00:05:50,315
Hey. Sorry. You ready?

77
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:53,085
Hey, come on,
let's get this over with.

78
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:56,288
Thank you for seeing us.

79
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,256
We don't wanna take up
too much of your time,

80
00:05:58,258 --> 00:05:59,358
so I'll get right to it.

81
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,829
Um, I regret to inform you that
with the benefit of hindsight,

82
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:08,567
Mr. Ehrmantraut will be amending
his original statement a tad.

83
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:11,203
A tad? A wee bit.

84
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:13,472
He's decided that he can no
longer in good conscience

85
00:06:13,474 --> 00:06:17,609
claim that the gun found at the
scene belonged to Tuco Salamanca.

86
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:19,711
- So, whose gun was it?
- Who's to say?

87
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,214
You know how many guns
there are in Albuquerque?

88
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:23,515
Somewhere between the number of

89
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:26,451
rattlesnakes and
grains of sand.

90
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:27,619
So, a lot.

91
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:29,454
Was it your gun,
Mr. Ehrmantraut?

92
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:30,255
No, he is not saying that.

93
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:33,158
Can we hear it
from Mr. Ehrmantraut?

94
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,862
The gun wasn't Salamanca's.
That's all I can tell you.

95
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:37,496
You told us it was.

96
00:06:37,498 --> 00:06:40,665
You said Salamanca pulled it
and pointed it at you.

97
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:41,767
Well, he didn't.

98
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:43,668
Why are you
changing your story?

99
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:44,936
Good citizenship.

100
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:47,639
Look, there was only one set
of prints on the gun,

101
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:48,540
Salamanca's.

102
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:50,308
How's that gonna happen
if it wasn't his?

103
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,712
That's not really for my
client to say now, is it?

104
00:06:53,714 --> 00:06:55,881
He's not a forensics expert.

105
00:06:55,883 --> 00:07:00,986
Who knows? Maybe it fell
from a passing bird's beak.

106
00:07:00,988 --> 00:07:03,455
And Mr. Salamanca caught it
and tried to throw it away.

107
00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:05,424
I mean, the possibilities
are endless.

108
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:08,026
Has Salamanca threatened you,
Mr. Ehrmantraut?

109
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:08,560
Hey.

110
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:10,729
We wanna put this
guy away for years.

111
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:12,931
The gun makes all the
difference, you know that.

112
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,800
You gonna let this person
victimize you twice?

113
00:07:14,802 --> 00:07:17,202
Forget about the gun.
All right?

114
00:07:17,204 --> 00:07:18,537
The gun was not Salamanca's.

115
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:19,805
If you try to
introduce it in evidence,

116
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:23,275
Mr. Ehrmantraut will make himself
available to the defense,

117
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:25,210
and he will set
the record straight.

118
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:28,346
Categorically
and unequivocally.

119
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:32,617
Did he threaten you,
or pay you off?

120
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:36,721
Whoa! Okay, that's it.
We are done. Let's go.

121
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,310
You're doing the right thing.

122
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:02,147
This Salamanca character?
Maniac.

123
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,216
I had my own...

124
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:07,752
thing with him.

125
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:08,854
I didn't wanna say before,

126
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:11,756
because conflict of interest,
yadda yadda,

127
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:14,192
but, yeah, he's nuts.

128
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,829
I'm talking,
he had me hog-tied in

129
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:20,765
the desert with
a gun to my head.

130
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:22,868
Broke two guys' legs,
right in front of me.

131
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,538
If I hadn't talked him down,
he probably would've...

132
00:08:26,874 --> 00:08:31,042
I'll spare you the gory details,
but it was a deal and a half.

133
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:33,745
Not something you forget.

134
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:37,148
And you're
telling me this, why?

135
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:39,184
Don't be too tough on yourself.

136
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:42,587
Like they say, discretion is
the better part of velour.

137
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:45,390
I would've done the same thing!

138
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:46,458
Hey, today, it's on me.

139
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,261
No charge.

140
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,865
You take the next one.

141
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:56,001
And bill me.

142
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:01,439
Ingrate.

143
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:06,912
<i> Hey, Jimmy.</i>
Did you tell Howard yet?

144
00:09:06,914 --> 00:09:08,547
<i>I can't really talk right now.</i>

145
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:09,915
You didn't tell him.

146
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:12,517
No. And I won't
until it's rock solid.

147
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,985
Like,
offer-letter-in-hand solid.

148
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:15,954
<i>When are you gonna get
that offer letter?</i>

149
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:19,491
I'm guessing next Thursday, after
my interview with the partners.

150
00:09:19,493 --> 00:09:21,993
Yeah, but that's just
a formality, right?

151
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:23,461
Basically. I hope.

152
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:26,731
What's the offer, you think?
I mean, brass tacks.

153
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:29,034
<i>Well,</i>
<i>it's not gonna be as plush</i>

154
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:30,101
<i>as your deal at Davis and Main,</i>

155
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:31,603
<i>but they'll make me partner</i>
<i>in two years.</i>

156
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:35,307
<i>As opposed to somewhere between
five years and never at HHM.</i>

157
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:36,074
Not too shabby.

158
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,043
<i>Yeah. And then</i>
<i>there's my law school loans.</i>

159
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:39,377
What is that,
a couple of grand by now?

160
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,279
I wish. I had to finance
the whole thing,

161
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:45,383
and was only making mail room money.
I've got like 15,000 left.

162
00:09:45,385 --> 00:09:47,986
Wow. Schweikart
wants you bad?

163
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:50,021
<i> Jimmy, did you have</i>
<i>something you needed?</i>

164
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:54,159
No, no. Just checking in.
I'll see you later, okay?

165
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:55,794
<i>If you play your cards right.</i>

166
00:09:55,796 --> 00:09:56,995
<i> Bye.</i>

167
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:07,639
Omar! Where are you?

168
00:10:07,641 --> 00:10:11,977
Omar, would you be so kind
as to take a letter for me?

169
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:14,012
"Dearest Clifford..."

170
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:16,181
No, that's too much.

171
00:10:16,183 --> 00:10:20,452
"Dear Cliff..." What do you
think, "Clifford" or "Cliff"?

172
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:23,188
I don't... It depends
on what the letter is.

173
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,056
It's just fine. Treat yourself.

174
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:27,125
"Dear" whoever you put in.

175
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:31,830
Continuing. 
"My heart is heavy as..."

176
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:34,766
No, it sounds like
a medical condition.

177
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:39,371
Let's go with
"It is with a heavy heart."

178
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:40,438
Okay?

179
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,906
"It is with a heavy heart"

180
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:46,511
"that I tender my resignation
to Davis and Main."

181
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:48,813
"Tender" is better
than "submit," yeah?

182
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:51,016
Resignation?
 Yes, sir.

183
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:55,220
So, "Tender, blah blah blah,
to Davis and Main."

184
00:10:55,222 --> 00:10:58,690
"These have been, 
some of the most"

185
00:10:58,692 --> 00:11:02,861
"professionally satisfying
days of my life."

186
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:08,900
What's wrong? You think I'm
laying it on too thick?

187
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:10,669
No, um...

188
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:14,406
I just didn't realize
how unhappy you were here.

189
00:11:14,408 --> 00:11:20,111
Not unhappy, per se.
More like, not happy.

190
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:23,114
I had no idea.

191
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:28,253
It's not your fault, buddy.
You're top notch.

192
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:29,054
Where were we?

193
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:31,156
It's just you worked
so hard to get here,

194
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:36,027
and it's so much to give up.
I mean, the perks alone...

195
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:39,898
Yeah, the apartment is...
Yeah.

196
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,366
And the car.

197
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:44,936
For the most part,
the car's pretty sweet.

198
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:45,804
And the bonus.

199
00:11:45,806 --> 00:11:47,706
The bonus is a done deal.

200
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:51,076
They already cut me the check.
I get to keep the bonus.

201
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:53,645
Not if you quit.

202
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:57,515
Before a certain term,
I think yours is a year?

203
00:11:57,517 --> 00:12:00,218
You have to pay the money back.

204
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:09,894
It's, um...

205
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:12,931
Yeah, um...

206
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:18,336
Yeah, 
I think it's right there.

207
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:19,871
Yeah.

208
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:30,982
Omar, that...

209
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:35,854
That whole
letter of resignation thing?

210
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:40,625
I didn't mean that.
Not a word. I...

211
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:45,330
I... I'm so incredibly

212
00:12:45,532 --> 00:12:47,065
stressed out.

213
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:50,068
I'm stressed out the wazoo.

214
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:50,602
I...

215
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:55,440
To be honest, it's been
more of an adjustment

216
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:57,776
than I expected
here at Davis and Main.

217
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:02,580
So, I just... Don't repeat
what I said to anyone.

218
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:07,118
I figured something had to be wrong.
Really wrong.

219
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,054
Because you like
it here, right?

220
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:11,589
I love it.

221
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:15,493
Call it a momentary
lapse of reason.

222
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:19,063
Let's just rewind the tape

223
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:22,167
and you know,
forget this happened.

224
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:25,670
Mum's the word. No problem.

225
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:26,805
I feel better already.

226
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:29,941
You know, sometimes, you have
to say something out loud

227
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:33,745
to hear how crazy it sounds.

228
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:36,481
Thank you, Omar.

229
00:15:36,303 --> 00:15:37,435
Hi, Jimmy McGill.

230
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:41,839
Jimmy, this is Al Newman
of Allied Funeral Homes.

231
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:43,141
Great to meet you, Al.

232
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:44,609
Nice tie.

233
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:45,009
Thanks.

234
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:48,379
All right, let's get
started, shall we?

235
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:12,236
What are you doing?

236
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:14,739
Hey, Doug, got a
juicer for the office.

237
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:15,974
Jimmy, it's very loud.

238
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:16,708
Brian, come on in.

239
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:17,775
We have clients out there.

240
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:20,311
Sure, you can. Two! Coming right up.
Jimmy...

241
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:25,283
Sometimes, it gets a little jammed.
You just gotta force it.

242
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:27,885
Shit!

243
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:28,920
I'm...

244
00:16:28,922 --> 00:16:31,322
I'm spreading it around.
Did I get you? Nah.

245
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:34,959
Now I got you with this.
Chrissakes, Jimmy!

246
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:51,642
Backwards only.

247
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:53,778
Solo backward-o, yeah?

248
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,813
Because we got suction
that way.

249
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:57,115
Leverage. It's physics.
El physico!

250
00:16:57,117 --> 00:17:03,354
Don Clifford wants his floors clean.
<i>Limpio, limpar.</i>

251
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:04,922
<i> Comprende?</i>

252
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:06,324
Dude, I'm from Michigan.

253
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:09,260
So, you don't understand
a word I've been saying?

254
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:10,328
What...

255
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:14,298
Good night.
No, you try. Backwards.

256
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:25,843
<i> Excuse me?</i>

257
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:28,613
Can I have everyone's
attention, please?

258
00:17:28,615 --> 00:17:30,081
Everyone can hear me? Good.

259
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:31,916
Frankly,
this is not a conversation

260
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:34,185
I ever thought I would have
in my professional career.

261
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:35,486
But it's been
brought to my attention

262
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:39,290
that we have an ongoing
situation in the washroom.

263
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:40,825
Someone's not flushing.

264
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:42,560
Once is an accident,
maybe even twice.

265
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,228
Three times?
No, that's a pattern.

266
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,097
And we're not talking
about a number one!

267
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:47,865
Yes, thank you, Erin.

268
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:49,634
Now, I'm not here
to shame anyone.

269
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:52,236
Nor do I even want to know
who did it, but...

270
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:53,738
Cliff? It was me.

271
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,374
Jimmy, I just said
I didn't wanna know.

272
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:58,910
Hey, we need the water.

273
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:01,112
I read somewhere
that the Santa Fe watershed

274
00:18:01,114 --> 00:18:03,815
is down two full
inches this year!

275
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:07,952
Every time you flush a toilet,
you waste a gallon of water.

276
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:10,855
A gallon, what could
be greener than this?

277
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:14,492
They're low-flow toilets,
Jimmy. From now on, flush.

278
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:19,063
Low-flow, that's good.
Good thinking.

279
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:55,500
What is that?

280
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:11,182
Jimmy?
What's going on in there?

281
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:13,551
Jimmy!

282
00:19:13,553 --> 00:19:15,353
You can hear this
through the door?

283
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:16,821
I didn't realize, I'm sorry.

284
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,656
What do you think you're doing?

285
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:22,293
I took your advice.
I'm blowing off steam.

286
00:19:22,295 --> 00:19:23,127
"Blowing off steam"?

287
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:24,829
Yeah. Like you and
your guitar, you know?

288
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:29,800
I gotta say, you're right. I
mean, it really helps with stress.

289
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:32,203
I know, I don't sound very
good, but I'm just learning.

290
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:35,873
I heard that the key is, you
have to keep this bag inflated.

291
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,008
Enough!

292
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:41,212
Put that down.
Now, I want you in my office.

293
00:19:51,224 --> 00:19:52,356
You win.

294
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,125
What do I win?

295
00:19:54,127 --> 00:19:54,759
You're fired.

296
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:57,428
What? Cliff, if this is
about the bagpipes...

297
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:00,131
It's not about the bagpipes.

298
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:01,165
Well, of course,
it's the bagpipes.

299
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:03,234
It's the bagpipes and it's
the not flushing and this,

300
00:20:03,236 --> 00:20:07,638
and this optical migraine you call
a business suit! It's about...

301
00:20:08,608 --> 00:20:12,310
It's about you keeping your bonus.
That's what this is about!

302
00:20:12,312 --> 00:20:15,546
Been brushing up on your
contract law, haven't you?

303
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:16,380
You want outta here, clearly,

304
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:19,350
but you can't just up and quit
and expect to keep your bonus.

305
00:20:19,352 --> 00:20:20,218
And if I fire you for cause

306
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,387
like I should have done for the
TV commercial, again, no bonus.

307
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:26,023
However, if I fire you
not for cause,

308
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:28,759
but for being
an all-around jackass,

309
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:30,027
yeah, hurray for you.

310
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:33,130
If you think there's been
some malfeasance here...

311
00:20:33,132 --> 00:20:33,598
Save it.

312
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,168
I could fight you on this,
but you're not worth my time.

313
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:40,171
I'd rather just have you gone.

314
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:45,943
I'm sorry you feel that way.
I'll just...

315
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:48,246
pack up.

316
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:48,779
First,

317
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:51,983
do me the favor of not treating
me like a fool for once.

318
00:20:51,985 --> 00:20:54,685
Tell me, how exactly
did I mistreat you?

319
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:56,454
What did I do to deserve
this kind of behavior?

320
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:58,155
We gave you opportunities.
Encouraged you to excel.

321
00:20:58,157 --> 00:21:01,559
We got you a car, an apartment.
Hell, that cocobolo desk!

322
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:06,430
Do you see a desk like that in here?
You never gave this a chance.

323
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:07,965
Why?

324
00:21:09,035 --> 00:21:11,135
I tried to make it work.

325
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:13,871
Really, I did. I'm just...

326
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:15,172
A square peg.

327
00:21:15,174 --> 00:21:18,776
If you knew that,
why did you take the job?

328
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,148
I'm sorry.

329
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,686
How much was the desk?

330
00:21:28,688 --> 00:21:30,454
$7,000.

331
00:21:32,425 --> 00:21:34,492
I'll write you a check.

332
00:21:34,494 --> 00:21:36,927
Fine. For whatever good
that does.

333
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:39,597
Take your desk and get out.

334
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:45,603
Hey, Cliff, for what it's worth?
I think you're a good guy.

335
00:21:45,838 --> 00:21:49,173
For what it's worth,
I think you're an asshole.

336
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,294
Hey!

337
00:22:36,756 --> 00:22:39,123
Yeah. It's open.

338
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:41,559
Jimmy?

339
00:22:41,561 --> 00:22:43,828
Hey. Can I talk to
you for a minute?

340
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,496
Does Howard know you're here?

341
00:22:45,498 --> 00:22:46,897
God, no. I snuck in.

342
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:49,967
Yeah, but make it quick.

343
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:53,070
Actually, can we talk
in the conference room?

344
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:54,505
Why?

345
00:22:54,507 --> 00:22:55,373
It's just more appropriate.

346
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:59,210
No one's gonna need it till 4:00.
I checked.

347
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:03,481
Please. Ten minutes, tops.

348
00:23:04,016 --> 00:23:05,950
After you.

349
00:23:06,152 --> 00:23:07,318
Have a seat.

350
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:11,122
What... What's going on?
Spill it.

351
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:14,859
Okay.

352
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:17,795
Schweikart & Cokely
will pay your debt to HHM

353
00:23:17,797 --> 00:23:20,531
and make you a partner
in two years. Correct?

354
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:22,366
Apparently.

355
00:23:22,835 --> 00:23:24,969
That's the deal, yes. Why?

356
00:23:24,971 --> 00:23:27,938
Would you
entertain a better offer?

357
00:23:28,174 --> 00:23:30,307
From whom? HHM?

358
00:23:30,943 --> 00:23:32,643
From me.

359
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:35,679
I'll make you
a partner tomorrow.

360
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:39,049
Consider that proof of concept.

361
00:23:39,185 --> 00:23:42,820
Wexler-McGill, Partners at Law.

362
00:23:42,822 --> 00:23:45,322
You and me, together.

363
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,925
If Schweikart can pay
your debt, so can I.

364
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:52,062
And with my signing bonus,
you'll have a clean slate.

365
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,464
Sky's the limit.

366
00:23:53,466 --> 00:23:55,800
Hey, we're good together.
You know that.

367
00:23:55,802 --> 00:23:59,370
So, what's stopping us?
Let's jump in with both feet.

368
00:23:59,372 --> 00:24:03,441
Be our own bosses.
Build our own future.

369
00:24:04,277 --> 00:24:07,077
"Be our own bosses."

370
00:24:07,513 --> 00:24:08,245
What about clients?

371
00:24:08,247 --> 00:24:10,414
Mesa Verde just signed
with you, didn't they?

372
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:12,483
It'll be a hard sell
to take them with me.

373
00:24:12,485 --> 00:24:14,118
Then there'll be
another Mesa Verde.

374
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:19,690
That was all you, Kim. You did
it once, you can do it again.

375
00:24:21,994 --> 00:24:24,028
You make it sound easy. No.

376
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:27,865
You're talking to a guy who lived
in the back of a nail salon.

377
00:24:27,867 --> 00:24:30,668
This is gonna be a whole lot
of blood, sweat and tears.

378
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:31,368
At least at the start.

379
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:35,940
But in the end, we'll have a
practice that is 100% ours.

380
00:24:35,942 --> 00:24:37,274
That's worth it.

381
00:24:37,276 --> 00:24:40,110
Or we fail and we end up
with nothing.

382
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:41,645
You're right. It's a gamble.

383
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:42,279
It's a big one.

384
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:43,914
Yeah, but you're
betting on yourself,

385
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:47,318
and from where I sit,
the odds are in your favor.

386
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,886
You are an amazing lawyer.

387
00:24:48,888 --> 00:24:52,690
This is your chance
to show the world that.

388
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:56,160
So, why not go to Schweikart?

389
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:59,530
They'll make me partner, and
they're a solid, respectable firm.

390
00:24:59,532 --> 00:25:00,498
You can't deny that.

391
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,533
You deserve more
than just a lateral move.

392
00:25:02,535 --> 00:25:05,603
Bottom line, that's what
Schweikart represents.

393
00:25:05,605 --> 00:25:08,105
He's just Howard Hamlin
by a different name.

394
00:25:08,107 --> 00:25:09,507
You keep talking
about me and Schweikart.

395
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:11,141
What about you
and Davis and Main?

396
00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:13,611
It's over. I quit today.

397
00:25:13,613 --> 00:25:16,347
Technically, I got fired.

398
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,315
What happened?

399
00:25:18,317 --> 00:25:20,484
It was mutual,
and a long time coming.

400
00:25:20,486 --> 00:25:25,222
That job was never the
right fit for me. This is.

401
00:25:28,728 --> 00:25:33,831
If we're going to be law partners,
I need to know one thing.

402
00:25:35,101 --> 00:25:36,634
What kind of lawyer
are you going to be?

403
00:25:36,636 --> 00:25:41,272
I don't mean what kind of law you're
going to practice, I mean...

404
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:44,308
Are you going to
play it straight,

405
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:48,212
or are you going
to be colorful?

406
00:25:48,648 --> 00:25:51,916
I'm gonna play it straight.
Right down the line.

407
00:25:51,918 --> 00:25:56,787
I'm gonna dot every "I"
and I'm gonna cross every...

408
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:08,832
There's no point in me doing
this if I can't be myself.

409
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:11,802
Every time I try to do
things someone else's way,

410
00:26:11,804 --> 00:26:15,739
it blows up in my face. That's
what happened at Davis and Main,

411
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:17,241
look how that turned out.

412
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:19,543
I almost derailed your career.

413
00:26:19,545 --> 00:26:21,779
Pissed everyone off.

414
00:26:21,781 --> 00:26:25,783
I've been trying to be the person
someone else wants me to be

415
00:26:25,785 --> 00:26:27,251
for I don't know how long.

416
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:29,820
First it was Chuck.
Then it was you.

417
00:26:29,822 --> 00:26:32,856
And that's not your fault.
That was my choice.

418
00:26:32,858 --> 00:26:37,895
But if we're gonna do this,
I gotta go into it as me.

419
00:26:37,897 --> 00:26:40,864
So, yeah.

420
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:42,967
Colorful. I guess.

421
00:26:43,469 --> 00:26:45,703
What do you say?

422
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:49,106
I just...

423
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:52,476
I don't see why it's so important
to you that we work together.

424
00:26:52,478 --> 00:26:56,146
I mean, we're already...
Why do you need me for this?

425
00:26:56,148 --> 00:26:57,982
I don't need you.

426
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,950
I want you.

427
00:27:00,987 --> 00:27:02,987
You've got me.

428
00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:06,557
Just not as a law partner.

429
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:19,069
I have to get back to work.

430
00:27:19,171 --> 00:27:20,337
You okay?

431
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:23,340
Yeah. No, I'm fine.

432
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:26,310
Go on.

433
00:27:28,414 --> 00:27:30,314
I'll see you later?

434
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:32,049
Yeah.

435
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:41,091
It's move-in ready,
as you can see.

436
00:27:41,093 --> 00:27:43,794
And they've renovated
within the past three years.

437
00:27:43,796 --> 00:27:47,164
New floors, new kitchen...

438
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:50,768
And it's a good
amount of space.

439
00:27:51,804 --> 00:27:54,238
It's not too much house,
you think?

440
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,973
No, not at all.

441
00:27:55,975 --> 00:27:57,875
And look at that backyard!

442
00:27:57,877 --> 00:28:01,245
They're leaving the playhouse.
Isn't that amazing?

443
00:28:01,247 --> 00:28:03,580
Kaylee will go crazy for that.

444
00:28:03,582 --> 00:28:05,449
You'll never get
her outta there.

445
00:28:05,451 --> 00:28:07,084
I know, right?

446
00:28:07,086 --> 00:28:08,018
And the most important part,

447
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,421
the schools are good and
the neighborhood is great.

448
00:28:10,423 --> 00:28:13,691
I called the local precinct
and asked about crime stats,

449
00:28:13,693 --> 00:28:15,492
they're some of the lowest
in the city.

450
00:28:15,494 --> 00:28:17,661
Plus, I got a good
vibe from him.

451
00:28:17,663 --> 00:28:20,030
They sounded really responsive.

452
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,331
Sounds perfect.

453
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:22,933
Yeah.

454
00:28:23,402 --> 00:28:24,068
Do you like it?

455
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:28,072
If you're happy, I'm happy.
Do you like it?

456
00:28:28,074 --> 00:28:29,406
Yeah. I do.

457
00:28:29,408 --> 00:28:31,775
But... I'm... But what?

458
00:28:32,344 --> 00:28:33,077
It's a lot of money.

459
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:35,212
I know, I'm like a broken record.
But it is.

460
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:39,016
You don't worry about that. We'll make it happen.
Whatever the cost.

461
00:28:39,018 --> 00:28:40,084
Mike, I... I'm serious.

462
00:28:40,086 --> 00:28:44,788
Not another thought.
If you want it, it's yours.

463
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:56,533
How are we looking?

464
00:28:56,535 --> 00:28:58,535
It's perfect.

465
00:28:58,537 --> 00:28:59,770
Let's do it. Fantastic!

466
00:28:59,772 --> 00:29:02,306
Do you have another hour? We
could go down to the office,

467
00:29:02,308 --> 00:29:04,508
get the pre-approval
in order, all that.

468
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,343
Sounds good.
We'll meet you there.

469
00:29:06,345 --> 00:29:08,112
Sure. See you in a few.

470
00:29:08,481 --> 00:29:10,814
I feel like I can
finally breathe.

471
00:29:10,816 --> 00:29:13,817
Good. I'm glad.

472
00:29:15,521 --> 00:29:16,854
You wanna ride together?

473
00:29:16,856 --> 00:29:18,122
No, I'll follow you over.

474
00:29:18,124 --> 00:29:21,892
Car looks good. Wouldn't even
know you so much as scratched it.

475
00:29:21,894 --> 00:29:25,095
Yeah, um,
my guy knows his stuff.

476
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:31,535
Thank you, Pop. For everything.

477
00:29:38,878 --> 00:29:42,212
You go on now.
I'll see you there.

478
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:44,348
Okay.

479
00:30:27,726 --> 00:30:29,193
Right here.

480
00:30:38,771 --> 00:30:41,605
Sorry, I almost
lost you at that light.

481
00:30:41,607 --> 00:30:43,407
No problem.

482
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,848
Watch the fish tank.

483
00:30:55,154 --> 00:30:56,453
On the left.

484
00:30:56,455 --> 00:30:58,655
My left. My left.

485
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:01,959
There.

486
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:05,395
What do you think?

487
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:09,066
Yeah.

488
00:31:09,068 --> 00:31:10,868
It's, um...

489
00:31:12,004 --> 00:31:13,470
Yeah.

490
00:31:21,447 --> 00:31:24,448
What should I do with this?

491
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:26,016
Dump it on
the side of the road.

492
00:31:26,018 --> 00:31:29,119
That's where I got it
in the first place.

493
00:31:43,302 --> 00:31:44,201
Hey, buddy.

494
00:31:44,203 --> 00:31:46,203
This is over and above.
No, it's okay. Really.

495
00:31:46,205 --> 00:31:48,372
How about a drink?
I know I could use one.

496
00:31:48,374 --> 00:31:49,539
Come on, I'm buying.

497
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:51,141
Nah, I'm good. Long drive.

498
00:31:51,143 --> 00:31:52,910
Cucumber water for the road?

499
00:31:52,912 --> 00:31:54,778
I'm totally set. Thank you.

500
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:57,814
Gotta get home to my kids.

501
00:31:57,816 --> 00:32:01,818
How about you?
What are you gonna do now?

502
00:32:02,655 --> 00:32:04,888
Onward and upward.

503
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:08,191
Thanks, Omar. Drive safe.

504
00:32:45,397 --> 00:32:46,196
Hello!

505
00:32:46,198 --> 00:32:51,134
You've reached the law offices
of James M. McGill, Esq.

506
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:53,136
Kindly leave...

507
00:33:06,785 --> 00:33:11,922
Hi, you've reached
the law offices of Jimmy McGill.

508
00:33:11,924 --> 00:33:12,589
Please leave a message,

509
00:33:12,591 --> 00:33:16,226
and I'll get back to you
as soon as I can. Thanks.

510
00:34:22,027 --> 00:34:25,095
Summary judgments, yes.
I've handled six.

511
00:34:25,097 --> 00:34:27,664
Actually, one recently
was quite complex.

512
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:32,002
It was a litigation,
the result of a nasty divorce.

513
00:34:32,004 --> 00:34:33,403
My client was suing
her former company,

514
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:36,106
which she and her ex had
split in their settlement.

515
00:34:36,108 --> 00:34:40,143
The issues involved had me
chasing case law for weeks.

516
00:34:40,145 --> 00:34:42,212
Who heard it? Judge Pittman.

517
00:34:43,515 --> 00:34:44,481
That guy. He's a handful?

518
00:34:44,483 --> 00:34:49,786
Well, he can be a tough nut to
crack, but he did rule in my favor.

519
00:34:49,788 --> 00:34:52,122
All right, enough about law,
law, law.

520
00:34:52,124 --> 00:34:55,459
We know you're good.
We know you know your stuff.

521
00:34:55,461 --> 00:34:57,494
Tell us about Kim Wexler.

522
00:34:57,496 --> 00:34:59,596
You started in the mail room,
is that right?

523
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:03,633
I did. I was there almost,
well, 10 years ago now.

524
00:35:03,635 --> 00:35:06,036
Pulled yourself up by
your bootstraps. I like that.

525
00:35:06,038 --> 00:35:09,306
I see you went to UNM Law,
are you from New Mexico?

526
00:35:09,308 --> 00:35:11,508
Not originally.

527
00:35:11,677 --> 00:35:12,609
I'm from the Midwest.

528
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,611
A tiny little town,
barely on the map.

529
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:16,780
Near the
Kansas-Nebraska border.

530
00:35:16,782 --> 00:35:18,949
You've never heard of it.

531
00:35:19,051 --> 00:35:21,785
So, what brought you here?

532
00:35:22,221 --> 00:35:23,987
I guess...

533
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:27,657
One day, I just looked around
at my life, at who I was.

534
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:30,627
And I realized if I kept
going the way I was going...

535
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:33,029
Which way was that?

536
00:35:33,398 --> 00:35:33,830
Best-case,

537
00:35:33,832 --> 00:35:36,166
probably married to the guy
that ran the town gas station.

538
00:35:36,168 --> 00:35:38,969
Maybe cashiering down at the Hinky Dinky.

539
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:42,139
- The "Hinky" what?
- Hinky Dinky.

540
00:35:42,407 --> 00:35:45,275
It was our supermarket.
Um...

541
00:35:45,277 --> 00:35:47,511
I just wanted something else.

542
00:35:47,513 --> 00:35:49,746
What did you want?

543
00:35:52,751 --> 00:35:54,284
More.

544
00:35:54,453 --> 00:35:56,686
Thanks for coming by.
Always a pleasure.

545
00:35:56,688 --> 00:35:58,989
- Great to put a face to the name.
- Thanks.

546
00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:00,957
We're gonna put our
heads together and discuss.

547
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:03,994
But I feel safe to say that you
can expect to hear from us

548
00:36:03,996 --> 00:36:06,163
by tomorrow at the latest.

549
00:36:06,165 --> 00:36:07,764
That's...

550
00:36:07,766 --> 00:36:08,832
Fantastic.
I look forward to it.

551
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:12,502
We liked you when you came in here.
We like you more now.

552
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,738
Well, thank you so much
for taking the time.

553
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:17,440
And I will, 
speak to you soon.

554
00:36:17,442 --> 00:36:20,010
It was great to meet you, Lynne.
You, too.

555
00:36:20,012 --> 00:36:21,278
Perry. Pleasure, Kim.

556
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,480
Howard. It's Rich, actually.

557
00:36:23,482 --> 00:36:25,315
My God, I'm so sorry.
 No, no.

558
00:36:25,317 --> 00:36:26,550
I'm happy to be
confused with Howard.

559
00:36:26,552 --> 00:36:30,587
He's a damn good-looking man!
Don't worry about it.

560
00:36:31,423 --> 00:36:33,890
Come on, I'll walk you out.

561
00:38:23,669 --> 00:38:25,635
Hi. I'm here to see Jimmy.

562
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:26,569
He's in a meeting.

563
00:38:26,571 --> 00:38:28,805
A meeting? Have a seat.

564
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:35,979
And listen,
I don't ever want to hear

565
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:38,181
the word "permit" again.
<i>Capisce?</i>

566
00:38:38,183 --> 00:38:39,349
Your funeral, dude.

567
00:38:39,351 --> 00:38:41,251
Hey! What are you doing here?

568
00:38:41,253 --> 00:38:43,553
Just in the neighborhood.
Great!

569
00:38:43,555 --> 00:38:45,855
And I want
a dolly this time.

570
00:38:45,857 --> 00:38:46,956
What kind?

571
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:48,258
Western? Hustler, peewee?

572
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,126
Hey, watch your mouth
around the lady.

573
00:38:50,128 --> 00:38:51,761
How the hell should I know?
You're the nerd.

574
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:55,332
Just make it cheap.
Now go on, get outta here.

575
00:38:58,203 --> 00:39:00,070
I see you got
your old car back.

576
00:39:00,072 --> 00:39:03,573
Yep. The kidney people
wouldn't take it.

577
00:39:05,644 --> 00:39:07,010
Sorry.

578
00:39:09,748 --> 00:39:13,717
Well, you finally
got your cocobolo desk.

579
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:16,219
Finally got my cocobolo desk.

580
00:39:16,221 --> 00:39:20,090
Feel like it's a good omen
for what's next.

581
00:39:20,092 --> 00:39:21,991
And what's that?

582
00:39:21,993 --> 00:39:23,026
This!

583
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:26,262
Solo practice.
Being my own man again.

584
00:39:29,968 --> 00:39:32,001
So, how'd it go
with Schweikart?

585
00:39:32,003 --> 00:39:34,270
Went well.

586
00:39:34,973 --> 00:39:36,740
Should be getting
their offer tomorrow.

587
00:39:36,742 --> 00:39:40,977
That's fantastic!
I'm really happy for you.

588
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:41,911
Thanks.

589
00:39:41,913 --> 00:39:44,180
You know, we should celebrate.

590
00:39:44,182 --> 00:39:46,516
Whataburger! On me!

591
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,253
I'm not taking the job.

592
00:39:50,522 --> 00:39:51,888
Why not? You were right.

593
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:55,959
It's time for me to be my own boss.
Solo practice.

594
00:39:58,764 --> 00:40:02,432
What, you don't think
it's a good idea now?

595
00:40:02,534 --> 00:40:04,033
Don't tell me
you've changed your mind.

596
00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:07,704
No, I... I'm surprised, is all.

597
00:40:07,706 --> 00:40:12,909
Hey, I've said all along you're
too good for those clowns.

598
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:13,543
This is...

599
00:40:13,545 --> 00:40:18,314
Shit, yeah. Wow. It's great!

600
00:40:18,316 --> 00:40:21,217
Good. To that end,

601
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:23,420
I have a pitch for you.

602
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:32,228
Not Wexler-McGill.

603
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:34,764
But Wexler

604
00:40:35,066 --> 00:40:37,033
and McGill.

605
00:40:37,102 --> 00:40:40,103
We find an office,
share the housekeeping costs,

606
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:42,639
the rent,
electricity, everything.

607
00:40:42,641 --> 00:40:45,809
But I am Kim Wexler,
attorney at law,

608
00:40:45,811 --> 00:40:47,977
and you are Jimmy McGill,
attorney at law.

609
00:40:47,979 --> 00:40:51,548
Both free to
practice as we see fit.

610
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:53,383
Separate firms under one roof.

611
00:40:53,385 --> 00:40:56,386
We're both headed uptown,
so why can't we share a taxi?

612
00:40:56,388 --> 00:40:59,722
You do things your way
and I do them mine.

613
00:40:59,724 --> 00:41:04,994
We'll have freedom, but we aren't
each trying to go it alone.

614
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:10,033
Not partners.
Solo practitioners together.

615
00:41:12,404 --> 00:41:13,770
What do you think?

616
00:41:13,772 --> 00:41:16,940
I don't know what to say.

617
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:19,776
Say yes.
