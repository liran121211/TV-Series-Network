1
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:46,444
Sorry about the hiccup, folks.

2
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:48,613
Won't be long.

3
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:01,326
You got five minutes.

4
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:06,765
Howdy, folks!

5
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:11,636
Can someone tell me if
Mrs. Alma May Urbano is on board?

6
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:13,905
Alma May Urbano?

7
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:16,975
There you are!

8
00:01:16,977 --> 00:01:18,143
Hello, dear.

9
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:20,011
Very good to meet you.

10
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:20,578
My name's Jimmy.

11
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,580
I tried to visit
you at Sandpiper,

12
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,315
but they wouldn't allow me to.

13
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:26,551
Hey, you know what?
It doesn't matter.

14
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:31,189
I saw your bus broken down.
Here you are! Lucky me!

15
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:32,357
Do you prefer to be called

16
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:35,827
Mrs. Urbano or Alma May
or just plain Alma?

17
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:39,297
My last name is McGill,
but you can call me Jimmy.

18
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,166
Hey, everyone.
My name's Jimmy McGill,

19
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:43,802
I'm an attorney at law. But...

20
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:45,203
Don't mind me.

21
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:47,238
Just talk amongst yourselves.

22
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,943
Now, Alma May, do you recall responding
to a mailer from my law firm,

23
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:55,547
Davis & Main of
Santa Fe, New Mexico?

24
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:57,282
I... I don't know.

25
00:01:57,284 --> 00:02:01,052
We were looking to help
any Sandpiper residents

26
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:06,424
who may have been overcharged for
basic goods and services.

27
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:08,159
Now, does that ring a bell?

28
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:11,029
Oh! Maybe. Was it yellow?

29
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:14,265
It's canary yellow.
I picked that color myself!

30
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:18,169
Well, ma'am, I'm here to make sure you
get your money back.

31
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:21,139
What're you talking about?
Who took Alma May's money?

32
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:24,242
Uh, well, that's a
very good question.

33
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:27,212
And thank you for asking, Mister...

34
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:28,780
Amos. Amos Lydecker.

35
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:30,582
Mr. Lydecker, Jimmy McGill.

36
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:34,752
Now, nobody took
anybody's money, exactly.

37
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:38,056
Okay? It's not like the
Sandpiper people, you know,

38
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:44,796
put on a ski mask and mugged
Alma May here at gunpoint.

39
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:47,932
So, I want you to put that mental
image right out of your head.

40
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:49,200
See, what we're talking about here

41
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:50,935
is more of a...
It's just a discrepancy.

42
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:55,173
It's just a little thing.
It's fairly innocent.

43
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,208
But, we need to fix it.

44
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,010
You follow me?

45
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,546
Well, put it this way.

46
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:05,049
Alma May, let's say you're out
on a date with your boyfriend.

47
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:07,886
You do have a boyfriend, right?

48
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:10,288
Ah! You don't? Come on!

49
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,657
Alma May's holding out on me.

50
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,059
Do you have a nephew?

51
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:17,562
Nephew? Oh, yes. Steve.

52
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:19,197
Okay, Steve,
is he a good guy?

53
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,365
Yes, very good.

54
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:25,069
Okay. So let's say you and Steve
go out to dinner at,

55
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:25,803
well, Birdie's.

56
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:28,072
That's where you're
all headed today, right?

57
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:29,774
All right.

58
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:32,243
So, both of you
have a great meal.

59
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:37,115
Chicken fried steak and
green beans, and it's all perfect.

60
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:37,982
Here comes the check...

61
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:44,422
"Hey, wait a dog-gone, 24 bucks
for a side of buttermilk biscuits?"

62
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,357
- That doesn't sound right now, does it?
- No.

63
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:51,596
No, it does not. It sounds like
something got added up wrong.

64
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:55,066
Well naturally, you send your nephew,
Steve, to talk to the manager.

65
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,603
And naturally, the manager
corrects the mistake.

66
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,838
And what's more,
he gives you a coupon

67
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,842
for a free meal next time you come in.
How about that!

68
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:10,548
Well, that same kind of thing is what
happened at Sandpiper Crossing.

69
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:16,788
And nothing makes me sadder

70
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:20,224
than to see people
of the Greatest Generation,

71
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:23,594
people like my
own Nana and Bobo,

72
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,732
getting overcharged
by some great big company.

73
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,801
Even if it was an accident.

74
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:33,404
Now, I know that
the good people

75
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:35,606
at Sandpiper want
to make this right.

76
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:36,641
Sooner or later.

77
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:40,411
But you know what?
Well, sometimes,

78
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:41,679
it's just easier

79
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:47,418
if you get your nephew, Steve,
to go take care of it for you.

80
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:51,723
And that's how I
want you to think of me.

81
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:56,461
Georgiana. Hey there, Georgie Girl.
Thank you.

82
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:57,762
Oh! It's all there,
everything I need.

83
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:00,465
Thank you so much.
Enjoy your lunch.

84
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:06,304
Alma May. You did it.
Thank you so much. Thank you.

85
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:08,439
Thank you, Henry.

86
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:11,275
All right. Hey, Sue...

87
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:12,343
Okay.

88
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:15,980
Beautiful penmanship!
A lost art...

89
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:34,399
Schweikart and Cokely are
pursuing an aggressive strategy,

90
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:35,967
but looking at
the relevant case law,

91
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:39,437
I don't think it's going to play
with this magistrate judge.

92
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,106
I've read over a dozen of
her rulings, all of which

93
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:45,410
have sided with the plaintiff
on cases like this.

94
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:48,346
I've included a memo to that
effect in today's materials,

95
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,781
which you can
peruse at your leisure.

96
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:55,053
Thanks, Erin. How about we
move on to client outreach?

97
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:00,024
Jimmy?

98
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:01,959
You still with us?

99
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:02,927
Uh...

100
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:04,429
I'm going to save you
from having to brag.

101
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:08,599
Over 200 new Sandpiper clients
signed over thepast three weeks.

102
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:10,935
Well done, Jimmy.
Thank you.

103
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:11,569
Thanks, Cliff.

104
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:13,504
Uh, right now,
we're in the process

105
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:15,540
of mapping out
the entire Southwest,

106
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:19,243
targeting the largest
Sandpiper facilities first.

107
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:22,780
Phoenix, Colorado Springs,
Fort Worth, Provo.

108
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:23,548
That's just for starters.

109
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,552
Ideally, my goal, another 200
by the end of the month.

110
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:31,856
With this many folks, we have an
excellent shot at a solid batch

111
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:34,725
of plaintiffs for the classes
in each district.

112
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:38,196
Excellent. Look forward
to the next report.

113
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:41,799
On to a stickier wicket,
coordinating actions.

114
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:43,201
Um, sorry.
Before we move on.

115
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:47,171
I'd like to go back to client outreach,
just for a moment.

116
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,474
Looking over
these numbers, here.

117
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:53,878
Really astonishing results,
Jimmy. Incredible.

118
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:56,380
Your last trip to Amarillo,

119
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:58,716
you came back
with 22 new clients?

120
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:00,785
Twenty-four.
Twenty-four.

121
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:02,220
I'm confused.

122
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:04,188
Um, how many people
out there actually

123
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,325
responded to
our direct mailer?

124
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:09,727
One.

125
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:12,997
Hmm. Oh, right, yeah.

126
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,967
A Mars Alma May Urbano.

127
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:21,873
But you got 24 new clients
from this one response?

128
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,976
That is...

129
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:25,543
Wow!

130
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:27,945
Well, you're welcome. I mean,
what, is there a problem?

131
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:33,484
Well, might not some parties,
the opposing counsel for example,

132
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:35,720
see this differential
and conclude that

133
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:39,357
there may have been some
solicitation involved?

134
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:39,991
I did not solicit.

135
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:42,093
I'm just wondering how you
account for your success.

136
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:47,365
Because it will definitely raise eyebrows
over at Schweikart and Cokely.

137
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:49,767
I'm sorry, but it will.

138
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:53,137
Particularly in a case
involving seniors

139
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,138
for whom
the ethical guidelines

140
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:58,910
on solicitation were virtually
created by the ABA.

141
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:01,045
Chuck, I'm sure that...

142
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:06,284
Jimmy, if you could clear this up
that would be helpful.

143
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:09,754
I went to Amarillo to
confer with the client

144
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:15,159
and to make sure that we had
a solid good-faith basis

145
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,628
for our case there.
Overall.

146
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,763
As many of you are aware,

147
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:21,732
I've visited more than
my share of retirement homes.

148
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:24,502
These are close-knit communities.
Let me tell you,

149
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,270
word gets around real fast.

150
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:31,142
Dorothy in Phase 2 gets a new
Rascal Scooter, well, it's big news.

151
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:33,377
So these other 23 residents,
they approached you?

152
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:37,582
Cliff, they heard the scuttlebutt
before I crossed state lines.

153
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:41,652
And I certainly didn't have
to go knockin' on any doors.

154
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:43,321
And is it any surprise
that they wanna

155
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:45,256
speak with
the guy who was there

156
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:47,592
to show them they may have
money coming their way?

157
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:53,097
I gotta tell ya, with all that in mind,
I should've done better.

158
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,401
Makes sense. Howard?

159
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:00,805
Chuck?

160
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,174
We good to move on?

161
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,578
And, Chuck, not incidentally,

162
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,248
it is absolutely vital
that we dot our I's

163
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,415
and cross our T's here.

164
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:13,884
Invaluable. So, thank you.

165
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,320
The price of excellence
is eternal vigilance.

166
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:18,823
Indeed.

167
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:21,259
Coordination. I believe
that's where we left off.

168
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:26,163
That's right. Brian, this is your thing,
so why don't you take this?

169
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:27,365
Sure.

170
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:29,767
Considering the dimensions
of these cases,

171
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:31,836
taken together
and individually,

172
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:35,106
it makes sense to designate
someone to handle the scheduling.

173
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:38,809
What I'm proposing is that we
create a small team at D&M

174
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:40,711
dedicated specifically
to coordinating

175
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:42,480
all elements of the
individual actions.

176
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:44,315
We'll loop in HHM
when anything...

177
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,784
Brian. I'm sorry.
Excuse me for interrupting.

178
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:50,621
I just want to say that
I take Chuck's point.

179
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:51,155
I do.

180
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:54,659
I mean, this is like a
"wife of Caesar" type thing.

181
00:09:54,661 --> 00:10:00,798
There can't even be a hint of
solicitation, so I'm gonna pull back.

182
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,136
No more meet-and-greets
at Sandpiper facilities.

183
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:08,105
I'll find another way
to proceed.

184
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,174
Well, Jimmy,
we'll leave that up to you.

185
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,943
You know, client outreach
is your department.

186
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:16,847
Uh, where was I?
Okay, right.

187
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:19,216
If we have a more
consolidated nerve center

188
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:21,152
here in New Mexico,
where the...

189
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,861
Hey, Kim, where can I get a copy
of that Neiderman deposition?

190
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:34,598
I've got an extra Neiderman, Jimmy.
You can have one of mine.

191
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,300
Oh, wow, thanks, Erin.

192
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,902
No worries.

193
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,171
Shoot.
Where did I put that?

194
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:42,106
Thanks that's...

195
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:47,011
Man, can you believe
Chuck in there?

196
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:48,946
I mean, Jesus.
Solicitation?

197
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:50,781
Let me tell you, when we were
building this case,

198
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:53,517
I was chasing down
eighty year old mall walkers.

199
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,254
That was solicitation!
But did he say "boo"?

200
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:58,789
Bullshit, he did!

201
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,092
What happened in Texas?

202
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:03,527
Nothing. I did my job.

203
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:06,797
You didn't do a song and dance
in the day room for the old timers?

204
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:09,300
No! No.

205
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:10,601
Not in the day room.

206
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:14,605
Jimmy, you know solicitation can
get you disbarred. This matters.

207
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,374
Well, here's what
I think matters,

208
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:18,342
twenty-four senior citizens
now have representation.

209
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,145
Before I went they didn't even know
they were getting ripped off.

210
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:25,516
Now they have us in their corner.
How is that not a win?

211
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,753
You said in there
you'd find another way.

212
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:30,721
Did you mean it?

213
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:34,358
Sure. Absolutely.

214
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:40,297
Look, I...

215
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,835
I need you to understand
something very critical here.

216
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:46,137
Shoot.

217
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,708
I put myself on
the line to get you this job.

218
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:52,143
Okay.

219
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:55,045
I thought it was because I'm
sensational with old people.

220
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:58,082
Yeah, and who do you
think told them that?

221
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:00,284
So what
you threw me a bone?

222
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:02,620
No. Asshole.

223
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:05,756
You know
I believe in you.

224
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,058
But then I made my
beliefs known to them.

225
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,495
Now everything you do reflects
back on me. With Howard.

226
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:12,963
Because ultimately,
I talked him into

227
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:15,766
going out on
a limb for you, too.

228
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:21,505
Do you understand?
It's, it's my word. It's my judgment.

229
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:22,940
Yeah.

230
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:31,148
You and I both know
you can do this job.

231
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:39,223
But please,
you just have to do it right.

232
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:49,934
Well...

233
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:54,805
You wanna make sure you put
in the batteries the right way.

234
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,774
Or it won't work.

235
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,043
Then you close him up.

236
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:00,678
And...

237
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:01,712
I think...

238
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:04,782
I think you're good to go,
young lady.

239
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:08,853
Why don't you give
his foot a squeeze?

240
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:15,693
He's funny!

241
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:17,661
Oh, darling...

242
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,665
I think I'll name you...

243
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,435
Mr. Snuggles.

244
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:27,338
Are you hungry?

245
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,840
I'm gonna get you
some mashed potatoes.

246
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:33,077
That should get you
through to next month.

247
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,746
Mike, thank you.

248
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:37,848
But you shouldn't
feel that you need to...

249
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,117
Too late.

250
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:47,324
Something up?

251
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:49,593
Feels like something's up.

252
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:52,730
No. It's...
I didn't get much sleep.

253
00:13:52,732 --> 00:13:54,265
My head's...

254
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:54,765
I'm sorry.

255
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:58,736
You tell me it's none
of my business, I'll drop it.

256
00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:00,337
I don't want you to worry.

257
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,373
Not the worrying kind.

258
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:08,579
Last two nights,
I heard gunshots.

259
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:12,716
First night, they were maybe a
block or two over. Woke me up.

260
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:14,451
My first thought
was firecrackers,

261
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:16,420
I mean, that's what I
assumed at the time.

262
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:17,121
But then last night...

263
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:20,658
There's no mistaking it. There was
three of them. They were quick.

264
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,660
Pop, pop, pop Closer.

265
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:25,930
It was like they were
right outside the house.

266
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:27,298
You call the cops?

267
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,098
Yeah.

268
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,233
Took 'em over
an hour to get here,

269
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:31,135
then they looked around
for a whole two minutes.

270
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:34,772
But by then, of course,
there was nothing to see.

271
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:37,875
I'm staying here tonight.

272
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,977
No, Mike.
No, that's not necessary.

273
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:42,413
It is not a problem.
I'll take the couch.

274
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:46,684
Mike, you asked,
so I answered.

275
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:50,254
Please, don't make me sorry
I told you.

276
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:57,227
Kaylee, come, hmm?

277
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,163
Get your supper.

278
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:19,683
What about Colorado Springs?

279
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:20,751
Um...

280
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,921
Two hundred and eighty three
residents, and...

281
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,089
We sent out 283 mailers.

282
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:28,826
Yeah, and how many
response cards came back?

283
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,327
Zero.

284
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:31,762
Zero?

285
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:36,634
Son of a bitch.

286
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:38,902
Dana, Toni.
Have a good one.

287
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:40,571
You too, Mr. Main.

288
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:43,941
Cliff, uh,
can I have a second?

289
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:44,742
What's up?

290
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:46,644
Uh, it's those
Sandpiper mailers.

291
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:50,714
We should be getting
responses of like 12 to 15%.

292
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:52,416
But we're
getting ones and twos.

293
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:54,051
In Colorado Springs, zero.

294
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:55,953
Wow!
How can that be?

295
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,154
I'm thinking it's the staff.

296
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:59,723
They're tossing the mailers before
they can reach the residents.

297
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:03,193
Maybe they got told to do it
by the Sandpiper front office.

298
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:05,729
Which would be
actionable as hell.

299
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:07,398
If we could prove it.

300
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,499
Big "if."

301
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:10,801
And to do so would take more
manpower than I can spare.

302
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,871
For now, let's just stick with
getting those client numbers up.

303
00:16:13,873 --> 00:16:16,273
Guess you'd better
think of another way.

304
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,008
I think I got it.

305
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,544
TV commercial.
Highly targeted.

306
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:24,815
Let me tell you, at Sandpiper,
the trains run on time.

307
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,817
Mussolini would be proud.

308
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,752
Every one
I've visited so far,

309
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,220
same exact schedule.

310
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:31,488
10:00 a.m., water aerobics,

311
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,524
2:00 p.m., line dancing.
So on, and so forth.

312
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:36,927
They always leave 3:00 p.m.
to 4:00 p.m. free.

313
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:38,328
Why? <i>Murder, She Wrote.</i>

314
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,598
It's been in syndication
since, like, the 1850s.

315
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,966
And let me tell you,
when that thing comes on?

316
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:46,737
It draws the blue-hairs
like moths to a bug zapper.

317
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:50,174
3:14 p.m., end of
the first act cliff-hanger.

318
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:54,912
First commercial up, Davis & Main.
Guaranteed eyeballs.

319
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:55,379
Lots of 'em.

320
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:57,181
There's nothing
Sandpiper can do about that.

321
00:16:57,183 --> 00:17:01,418
We ran a commercial a few years back,
another class action case.

322
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:05,289
Kind of a new thing for us.
It's not exactly my go-to,

323
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,858
but generally speaking,
I'm open to it.

324
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,960
We will talk next week.

325
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:13,197
Great! Safe travels.

326
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:44,061
<i>Mesothelioma is
a rare lung disease</i>

327
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,697
<i>usually associated with
exposure to asbestos,</i>

328
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:48,398
<i>a known human carcinogen.</i>

329
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,734
<i>Long-term inhalation
of asbestos fibers</i>

330
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,402
<i>can cause serious or fatal illnesses</i>

331
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:56,340
<i>including malignant lung cancer,
mesothelioma and asbestosis.</i>

332
00:17:56,342 --> 00:18:00,944
I remember they worked real hard
to get that just right.

333
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:02,546
To get what just right?

334
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:04,815
Oh, the swirl.

335
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:08,752
They wanted it kind of nebulous,
but not too nebulous.

336
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,320
Then there was
the issue of the speed.

337
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:14,291
I remember there were a lot
of meetings about that.

338
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:15,159
I'll bet.

339
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:20,597
<i>For your free consultation,
call Davis & Main at 505-242-7700.</i>

340
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:24,601
<i>That's 505-242-7700.</i>

341
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:30,507
Cliff signed off on this?

342
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:33,143
The partners were very happy.

343
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:35,479
What do you think?

344
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:36,580
I think...

345
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:40,250
Whatever happened
to showmanship?

346
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,523
Yo. Check it out.

347
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:48,859
Ricola!

348
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,027
Ricola!

349
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:50,561
Hey!

350
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:52,963
Would you two ass-clowns
act like the professionals

351
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,365
your parents are
paying for you to become?

352
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:58,969
This happens to
be very valuable.

353
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:01,104
Yeah?
What is it?

354
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:03,774
This one is
the Alpine Shepherd Boy.

355
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:05,275
It's for her nephew.
So, come on.

356
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:09,580
Join me. Production meeting.
Bring it in. All right.

357
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:12,416
Now look, teamwork
makes the dream work.

358
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:16,019
Together, we can make something,
dare I say it, bravura.

359
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:19,022
And this is a golden opportunity,
especially for you guys,

360
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:20,691
'cause it's gonna play
all around the Southwest.

361
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:22,559
So, who knows what
it could lead to?

362
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:24,628
Better lead
to 100 bucks each.

363
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,063
What is it with you
and money?

364
00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:26,797
Saving up for a VX2000.

365
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:31,568
Hey! Pop quiz. What do we three
have in common with the greats?

366
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:35,572
Welles, Fellini, Bergman.
The biggies.

367
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:36,240
What?

368
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:39,877
All three of them, to a man,
worked in the highly lucrative,

369
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:42,980
creatively rewarding field,
of advertising.

370
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:45,148
And tonight, we join them.

371
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,384
This is heady stuff, right?

372
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:49,987
Okay. So, pay attention.

373
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:53,490
We open on granny,
and she is rocking.

374
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:56,260
So she's back and forth...

375
00:19:56,262 --> 00:19:59,229
Just very back and forth.

376
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:06,136
And then, very slowly and
smoothly, the camera, uh...

377
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:09,039
Moves towards...
Dolly?

378
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,108
A dolly. Good, yeah.

379
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,142
You see a dolly here?

380
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:14,077
You guys
didn't bring a dolly?

381
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,812
Nope. No dolly.

382
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:17,080
You didn't ask for a dolly.

383
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:18,682
Gotta ask, dude.
Dolly's extra.

384
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:19,883
It's true.

385
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:23,220
Okay. No dolly. Um.

386
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:26,223
We will improvise then.

387
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:26,990
Stay with me.

388
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:30,394
She's rocking,
she's shivering,

389
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:36,967
she's clutching at
a tattered shawl.

390
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:41,838
They turned the heat off on her,
these evil bastards.

391
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:45,175
She's cold and hungry,
she's friendless.

392
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:49,279
This is
heart-rending stuff, man.

393
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:54,551
Okay. It's a one-er. And it's shot
in glorious black and white.

394
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:56,086
We can do that, right?

395
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,587
Yeah.

396
00:20:58,324 --> 00:21:03,193
So, that's it? Old lady in a chair?
That's your commercial?

397
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:06,697
Does anybody like you?

398
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:12,002
I'm ready for my close-up,
Mr. McGill!

399
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:54,378
<i>It wasn't exactly set because
Perez wasn't back up in time.</i>

400
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:58,982
<i>Low ball. Strike one out right now.
Dale Carey at the plate.</i>

401
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,817
<i Perez at first base.</i>

402
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:04,121
<i>3-2.
Bottom of the ninth inning.</i>

403
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:06,990
<i>And the pitch.
Perez is going...</i>

404
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:10,360
<i>And it's over left,
third baseman Nick Johnson.</i>

405
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:12,562
<i>Perez goes into third,
he slides, safe!</i>

406
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:15,165
<i>Perez gets all the way
around the bases.</i>

407
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:18,235
<i>Perez to third base.
Dale Carey still at first.</i>

408
00:22:18,237 --> 00:22:23,740
<i>Looking to get to second.
But he'll stay at first. A great play.</i>

409
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:34,504
Hey, honey,
what's happening?

410
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:36,439
What's wrong?

411
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:39,209
What happened?

412
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,090
Where's Kaylee?
She's at school.

413
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:56,026
She's fine,
she doesn't know about it.

414
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:57,460
Are you all right?

415
00:24:57,462 --> 00:24:59,863
Let me show you.

416
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:04,267
It's up,
it's up there.

417
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:07,804
You see it?
It's right up there.

418
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:11,741
You see that?
You see the shape of it?

419
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:14,377
You do see it, right?

420
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:16,146
I see it.

421
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:19,149
What time did
you hear the shots?

422
00:25:19,151 --> 00:25:21,851
2:13 this morning.
I looked at the clock.

423
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:24,821
It was three of them,
It was exactly like last time.

424
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:26,556
And you didn't call
the police? Or did you?

425
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:29,526
No. I...
What's the point?

426
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:33,496
Um...

427
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:36,566
I'm thinking
outside the box, but...

428
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:40,403
Do you think maybe it's possible
that you dreamed it?

429
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:41,171
It happens sometimes.

430
00:25:41,173 --> 00:25:46,509
I didn't dream it, Mike, because
I didn't sleep a wink last night.

431
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:47,410
That came from a bullet.

432
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:49,212
I mean,
it must have, it wasn't there

433
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,114
before last night,
I promise you that.

434
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:52,616
And I,
I don't know what to...

435
00:25:52,618 --> 00:25:54,251
Okay.

436
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:55,719
Okay.

437
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:57,487
Jesus.

438
00:25:57,856 --> 00:26:01,258
I mean, I was here.
I was here and you weren't.

439
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,460
I believe you.

440
00:26:05,464 --> 00:26:07,297
I believe you.

441
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:12,402
All right.

442
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:17,707
That's it. We're getting you
and Kaylee out of this house.

443
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:19,676
End of story.

444
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:43,500
You ever wonder
about these things?

445
00:26:43,502 --> 00:26:44,200
What things?

446
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:46,870
This. Like,
what's the story with these?

447
00:26:46,872 --> 00:26:51,541
Who was it who first said,
"Hey, I know, a big bowl of balls!"

448
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:54,878
I don't know.
They came with the place.

449
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:55,545
No shit.

450
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:58,081
They're in every corporate
apartment in the world.

451
00:26:58,083 --> 00:26:59,316
They're like the
Gideon Bible.

452
00:26:59,318 --> 00:27:03,486
Hey. Don't be jealous of my big
bowl of balls. It's unbecoming.

453
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:06,222
Why do they all have
to have empty vases?

454
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:10,126
Well, it's the law.
Plus, it's a metaphor.

455
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:14,364
I gotta say, I will miss the
nail salon's vibrating chairs.

456
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:17,867
For you, I can make any chair
in this place vibrate.

457
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:20,470
You ready for this?

458
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,473
Okay, here it goes.

459
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,342
You're 86 years old,
you're a resident

460
00:27:25,344 --> 00:27:27,010
of Sandpiper,
Colorado Springs.

461
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:30,647
You just finished your
afternoon snack, lime Jell-O.

462
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:31,281
Lime. Got it.

463
00:27:31,283 --> 00:27:34,184
You're in the day room, you're
watching your favorite TV program.

464
00:27:34,186 --> 00:27:38,088
And what's this? There's been
another murder in Cabot Cove?

465
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:38,688
No!
Yes!

466
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:40,023
The sheriff is
in over his head.

467
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:42,826
And once again, Jessica Fletcher
has to put aside the novel

468
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:45,395
she's been writing,
and assist law enforcement.

469
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:49,332
Shocker! The killer
left behind a cryptogram.

470
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,401
And commercial.

471
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:03,947
<i>My husband and I scrimped
and saved for so many years.</i>

472
00:28:03,949 --> 00:28:05,949
<i>We did our best to
build a nest egg,</i>

473
00:28:05,951 --> 00:28:08,785
<i>so that we wouldn't be
a burden to our family.</i>

474
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:13,823
<i>After Ronald passed, I moved
to an assisted living facility.</i>

475
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:14,424
<i>A nice place.</i>

476
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:17,494
<i>They told me they'd take
care of everything. But...</i>

477
00:28:17,496 --> 00:28:21,097
<i>Then one day, they said
all my money was gone.</i>

478
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:26,503
<i>How could that be?
Where did it all go?</i>

479
00:28:26,972 --> 00:28:28,571
That's not a real tear is it?

480
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:29,172
It's Visine.

481
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:30,740
<i>If you or a loved one is a resident</i>

482
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:31,875
<i>of a Sandpiper Crossing facility</i>

483
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:35,111
<i>or other associated retirement
community, you may be eligible</i>

484
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:38,014
<i>to receive compensation.
For a free consultation,</i>

485
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:44,053
<i>call the law offices of
Davis & Main at 505-242-7700.</i>

486
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:48,391
<i>That's 505-242-7700.</i>

487
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:53,296
Well?

488
00:28:54,366 --> 00:28:55,665
You made that?

489
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:57,700
With some film students?

490
00:28:57,702 --> 00:28:59,169
I directed.

491
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:02,672
It looks professional.

492
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:04,307
And?

493
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:08,378
And if I were an 86-year-old
Sandpiper resident,

494
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:10,246
I'd be dialing.

495
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:12,449
Yes! Up top.

496
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:15,585
And all made in accordance
with the rules and regulations

497
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:19,088
of the American
Bar Association.

498
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,623
Good.

499
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:28,665
I can't believe
Davis & Main went for it.

500
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,900
Well, I'm in charge
of the department.

501
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:32,335
Yeah,
but still you know...

502
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:35,705
Cliff Main was fine with this.

503
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:37,874
Why wouldn't he be?

504
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:40,443
No, it's...
No, It's fantastic!

505
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:43,913
Let's celebrate. I'm getting more wine.
You want some?

506
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:45,882
Absolutely.

507
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:02,425
Colorado Springs, Colorado.

508
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:07,564
Yeah, I'd like the number
for KKTV Channel 11.

509
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:10,266
Omar!
What's the cut-off for FedEx?

510
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:13,336
I need to get a package out
<i>tout de suite.</i>

511
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:13,670
Oh.

512
00:31:13,672 --> 00:31:17,907
Uh, yes, can you connect me
to your ad sales department?

513
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:19,108
Thanks.

514
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:22,278
Gums look good.
No recession.

515
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,147
Tongue looks good, too.

516
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:25,281
Eyes are clear.

517
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:26,983
This little
lady's in fine fettle.

518
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:29,619
I could have one of the girls
trim her nails, if you like.

519
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:31,721
No. Some other time.

520
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:35,425
What do you got for me?

521
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:38,628
Bodyguard job. 200 bucks.

522
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,296
What else?

523
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:43,533
For you,
that's the best fit I've got.

524
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:51,841
I know a loan shark, always needs
enforcement and recovery.

525
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:54,310
Pays good
and it's steady work.

526
00:31:54,312 --> 00:31:57,480
Most of the time, we're just
talking intimidation.

527
00:31:57,482 --> 00:31:58,915
Strictly verbal.

528
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,783
"Most of the time."

529
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:03,987
I'm not breaking legs.
What else?

530
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:08,791
Look, we discussed this.

531
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:12,128
You want next-level pay,
you gotta do next-level work.

532
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:14,163
I respect where you're
coming from on this thing,

533
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:17,800
I do.
But that's just how it goes.

534
00:32:22,741 --> 00:32:24,340
All right.

535
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:26,409
She's gonna need a DHPP shot.

536
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:30,647
In six months. We'll send
you a reminder card.

537
00:32:30,649 --> 00:32:32,482
Until then.

538
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:35,218
Give me the bodyguard job.

539
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:38,488
For 200?

540
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,526
I'll call you with
the where and the when.

541
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:21,731
So everybody knows to...

542
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:22,298
They know.

543
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,968
Every line starting with 7700 has
been re-routed to the bullpen.

544
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:26,969
Plus your office.

545
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:28,404
All the assistants
know to keep them open.

546
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:31,207
So if you're on a call
and another call comes in,

547
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:32,775
the call doesn't go to
an answering machine, right?

548
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:36,112
Because, very important, old people
don't like talking to robots.

549
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:38,481
If I'm on a call and
another call comes in,

550
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:39,348
they'll roll over to Maida.

551
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:43,686
After that, Iris will get
the next one, and then Julian,

552
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,121
and then Barbara and Yvon.

553
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:47,423
Yeah.
Right on down the line.

554
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:47,990
Good.

555
00:33:47,992 --> 00:33:50,793
Let's make that the plan,
then.

556
00:33:51,296 --> 00:33:53,663
Oh, so...

557
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:54,931
What time do you have?

558
00:33:54,933 --> 00:33:59,202
Uh, quarter after.
It should be running now, right?

559
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,874
Is there anything else?

560
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:07,043
No, thanks.

561
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:10,413
It's...
I'll just be in my office.

562
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:18,387
Come on.

563
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:34,403
Come on.

564
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,306
Come on, Colorado Springs...

565
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:39,075
Come on.

566
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:01,297
Good afternoon, Davis & Main.
Attorneys at law.

567
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:02,498
How may we help you?

568
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,935
Yes, ma'am. Yes,
ma'am, that is unfortunate.

569
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,037
Now, to get your case started,

570
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,772
may I ask for a name
and a number

571
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:10,840
for one of our
attorneys to reach you?

572
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:12,742
Good afternoon, Davis & Main,
attorneys at law.

573
00:35:12,744 --> 00:35:13,943
How may we help you?

574
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,145
Good afternoon, Davis & Main,
attorneys at law.

575
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:17,580
Yes, sir. That is correct.

576
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:19,148
Good afternoon, Davis & Main.

577
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:19,882
One of our attorneys...

578
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:21,284
Good afternoon,
Davis & Main...

579
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:23,052
...one of our
attorneys get back to you.

580
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:23,820
Give me one second,

581
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:25,855
I'm just going to take down...
Yes. That is correct...

582
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:26,956
And you're
currently a resident

583
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,324
at the Colorado
Springs facility?

584
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:30,092
Good afternoon,
Davis & Main...

585
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:30,693
Yes, ma'am.

586
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:33,462
We'll be happy to send an information
packet right out to you.

587
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,464
May I ask,
are you currently a resident

588
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,166
of the Sandpiper
Crossing facility?

589
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,841
Bingo.

590
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:49,612
I'll just need a name
and a phone number.

591
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:28,451
Yeah?

592
00:36:28,453 --> 00:36:33,689
<i>Something came in this evening
and it's definitely next level pay.</i>

593
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:34,257
Yeah?

594
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:37,727
<i>It's probably a long shot
given your selectivity.</i>

595
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:39,729
<i>What's the job?</i>

596
00:36:39,731 --> 00:36:41,797
I asked,
the guy wouldn't tell me.

597
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:45,968
But whatever it is,
it's serious money.

598
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,837
And the guy,

599
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:51,307
he specifically asked for you.

600
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,510
And who's the guy?

601
00:36:55,013 --> 00:36:55,745
<i>I can't hold it, sir.</i>

602
00:36:55,747 --> 00:36:59,515
<i>No control on the planes, Captain.
We're going down and fast.</i>

603
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:01,150
"We're going down and fast."

604
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:03,319
Check this out,
this is a good part.

605
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:04,520
So do they all die?

606
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:07,423
Tell me that much.
Shh, shh, shh, shh!

607
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:11,027
Does Rock Hudson run
'em into an iceberg?

608
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:16,399
Is this before or after
he did <i>McMillan & Wife?</i>

609
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:18,868
Shut up. Watch the movie.

610
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:23,472
What is this weird
fascination you have

611
00:37:23,474 --> 00:37:26,976
with stories of men trapped
on the North Pole?

612
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:29,211
<i>Ice Station Zebra</i>
is on the North Pole.

613
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:30,713
<i>The Thing</i> takes
place on the South Pole.

614
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:33,716
They literally could not
be any more different.

615
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:36,152
My Dad loves this one.

616
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,654
Yeah, him and Howard Hughes.

617
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:40,923
I know, right?

618
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,825
Can't get two finer
reviews than that.

619
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:44,994
<i>How much pressure left
in the air banks?</i>

620
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:47,263
<i>Down to 800 pounds, sir.</i>

621
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,532
<i>Secure after group blow.</i>

622
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,505
Mmm-mmm.

623
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:57,807
It's the boss.

624
00:37:57,809 --> 00:37:58,941
At this hour?

625
00:37:58,943 --> 00:37:59,542
Yeah.

626
00:37:59,544 --> 00:38:03,746
Well, it's never too
late for congratulations.

627
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:08,617
Cliff! Jesus,
you're still at the office?

628
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:09,785
<i>You ran a commercial?</i>

629
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:14,557
Yeah. And, oh, my God, let me tell you,
the response has been...

630
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:16,525
You ran a commercial without
ever showing it to me?

631
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:18,761
Without first consulting
me and my partners?

632
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:20,830
Did you actually think
that was going to fly?

633
00:38:20,832 --> 00:38:24,300
<i>I was planning on
telling you in the morning.</i>

634
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:24,967
The day after it aired!

635
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:28,604
I only ran it once.
Just in one small market.

636
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:30,573
It was kind of an experiment,
all right

637
00:38:30,575 --> 00:38:33,442
kind of under the radar.

638
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:34,243
And in all fairness,

639
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:37,313
you did tell me client outreach
was my department.

640
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,180
<i>Don't be disingenuous.</i>

641
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:42,551
This commercial, I take it my firm's
name is mentioned?

642
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:45,955
Yes. Yeah.

643
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:46,522
Jesus.

644
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:48,157
Howard said you were
a little eccentric.

645
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:51,427
He didn't tell me you were
a goddamn arsonist!

646
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:55,931
Cliff, to be fair,
I don't think...

647
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:56,365
Uh...

648
00:38:56,367 --> 00:39:00,703
I apologize if there was any misreading
of the situation on my part.

649
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:02,972
But there's a very
positive headline here.

650
00:39:02,974 --> 00:39:06,142
We got 103 phone calls today.

651
00:39:06,144 --> 00:39:08,010
Off a measly $700 ad buy!

652
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,312
Now, that kind of return on
investment, you can't...

653
00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:13,649
Tomorrow morning. 8:00.
My office, with the partners.

654
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:14,650
And we want
to see this thing.

655
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:18,154
Cliff, when you see this,
I know you'll...

656
00:39:23,428 --> 00:39:25,261
Yeah, Cliff.

657
00:39:26,431 --> 00:39:30,032
Thank you. Yeah, you too.

658
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,301
Okay. See ya.

659
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:35,905
Golden Boy.

660
00:39:36,074 --> 00:39:38,607
That's me.

661
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:46,115
So, what'd I miss?
Anything blow up yet?

662
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:52,348
Feeling cautious?

663
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:57,586
You going to tell me
what we're doing here?

664
00:40:58,389 --> 00:40:59,855
I've got a problem.

665
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:02,091
Okay.
This problem,

666
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:03,659
I can't solve it myself.

667
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:08,230
This problem,
is it a who or a what?

668
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:13,035
There's a guy.

669
00:41:13,905 --> 00:41:17,206
I need him to go away.
