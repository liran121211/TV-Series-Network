1
00:01:22,073 --> 00:01:24,074
Good night, ladies.
Get home safe.

2
00:01:24,076 --> 00:01:25,776
See you later, Gene.

3
00:01:25,778 --> 00:01:27,378
Good night.

4
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:26,170
No, no, no, no!

5
00:02:26,704 --> 00:02:29,306
God damn it! No!

6
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:31,108
Come on.

7
00:02:34,012 --> 00:02:36,547
Hey! Hey!

8
00:02:37,882 --> 00:02:39,616
Somebody!

9
00:03:31,469 --> 00:03:32,836
Hey!

10
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:34,505
Hey!

11
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:38,809
Hey!

12
00:06:19,704 --> 00:06:20,570
All right. Here he is.

13
00:06:20,572 --> 00:06:23,874
Oh, great. Jimmy, right on time.
Good to see you.

14
00:06:23,876 --> 00:06:25,642
Hello, Howard.

15
00:06:25,644 --> 00:06:26,543
Hey. Hi.

16
00:06:26,545 --> 00:06:27,544
James McGill, Clifford Main.

17
00:06:27,546 --> 00:06:30,247
Just "Jimmy." And it's a pleasure
to meet you, Clifford.

18
00:06:30,249 --> 00:06:33,417
Likewise. We know all about
your work on Sandpiper.

19
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:34,184
Well, it's a group effort.

20
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:37,921
I mean, the folks at HHM are
just knockin' it out of the park.

21
00:06:37,923 --> 00:06:40,657
Well, we know the case
wouldn't exist without you.

22
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:41,191
Absolutely.

23
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:44,161
Once you get him on your team, you'll
know why I call him "Charlie Hustle."

24
00:06:44,163 --> 00:06:48,332
Jimmy, these are my associates,
Brian Archuleta,

25
00:06:48,334 --> 00:06:49,099
- and Erin Brill.
- Hello.

26
00:06:49,101 --> 00:06:51,201
Nice to meet you both.
It's great to meet you.

27
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:52,969
I hate to do this,

28
00:06:52,971 --> 00:06:55,772
but could I borrow Ms. Wexler
for a moment?

29
00:06:55,774 --> 00:06:56,807
If you will excuse us?

30
00:06:56,809 --> 00:06:59,876
Pardon me.

31
00:07:04,282 --> 00:07:05,582
What's going on?
I just...

32
00:07:05,584 --> 00:07:07,818
Listen, here's the thing.

33
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:12,522
If I take this job, does
that mean the two of us...

34
00:07:13,024 --> 00:07:14,191
I mean...

35
00:07:14,193 --> 00:07:16,660
Uh, does it mean...

36
00:07:16,662 --> 00:07:18,762
What? What the hell is this?

37
00:07:18,764 --> 00:07:22,799
If I take this job today,
with Davis and Main,

38
00:07:22,801 --> 00:07:26,703
does that mean
that you and me...

39
00:07:27,305 --> 00:07:30,440
Is this,
is this gonna happen?

40
00:07:35,947 --> 00:07:37,614
Jimmy.

41
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:39,449
I...

42
00:07:42,019 --> 00:07:43,353
I...

43
00:07:46,492 --> 00:07:51,461
One thing has absolutely
nothing to do with the other.

44
00:07:52,196 --> 00:07:53,163
Nothing at all.

45
00:07:53,165 --> 00:07:57,033
No. Of course not.
Why would it?

46
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,670
Great.

47
00:08:00,672 --> 00:08:02,806
Uh...

48
00:08:03,508 --> 00:08:04,574
Sorry about that.

49
00:08:04,576 --> 00:08:07,978
Listen, I just want to say
thank you, sincerely,

50
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,712
for your interest in me.

51
00:08:08,714 --> 00:08:12,783
It's an honor to be considered,
but at this time...

52
00:08:12,785 --> 00:08:13,884
At this time, um,

53
00:08:13,886 --> 00:08:16,887
I'm gonna have to take
myself out of the running.

54
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:19,856
Thanks. Thank you, Howard.

55
00:08:19,858 --> 00:08:22,125
Uh, Jimmy?

56
00:08:26,764 --> 00:08:28,398
Well, that was quick.

57
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,301
No charge.
Help me out here.

58
00:08:31,536 --> 00:08:32,769
Did I dream it,

59
00:08:32,771 --> 00:08:35,639
or did I have $1,600,000

60
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:37,607
on my desk, in cash?

61
00:08:37,609 --> 00:08:40,811
No one on God's green
Earth knew we had it.

62
00:08:40,813 --> 00:08:42,312
We could've split it 50-50.

63
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:46,650
We could've gone home
with $800,000 each.

64
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:48,485
Tax-free.

65
00:08:48,753 --> 00:08:50,987
Your point being?

66
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:52,055
Why didn't we?

67
00:08:52,057 --> 00:08:53,890
I remember you
saying something

68
00:08:53,892 --> 00:08:55,392
about doing the right thing.

69
00:08:55,394 --> 00:08:58,328
You want to know why
I didn't take that money?

70
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,530
Is that what you're asking?

71
00:09:00,532 --> 00:09:01,898
Yeah, that's what
I'm asking.

72
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:05,669
Me, personally,
I was hired to do a job.

73
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:06,736
I did it.

74
00:09:06,738 --> 00:09:08,839
That's as far as it goes.

75
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:09,940
Yeah.

76
00:09:09,942 --> 00:09:12,976
Well, I know what stopped me.

77
00:09:13,144 --> 00:09:14,377
And you know what?

78
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:16,913
It's never
stopping me again.

79
00:09:43,841 --> 00:09:45,775
<i> Chao cac co,</i> ladies.
<i> Chao cac co.</i>

80
00:09:45,777 --> 00:09:48,078
Mrs. Nguyen, it's a beautiful
day out there.

81
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,213
You should get out of this
place once in a while.

82
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:52,148
You know, throw a Frisbee,
have some fun.

83
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,550
I have a business to run.

84
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:56,419
Uh, no.
The business is running you.

85
00:09:56,421 --> 00:09:57,654
Listen to me.

86
00:09:57,656 --> 00:09:59,789
You'll thank me later.

87
00:10:02,293 --> 00:10:05,929
Cucumber water
for customer only.

88
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,679
Hey. It's me.

89
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,451
Hello?

90
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,720
Hello?

91
00:11:38,556 --> 00:11:41,524
It's me.
I got a new car.

92
00:11:41,526 --> 00:11:42,959
You like it?

93
00:11:42,961 --> 00:11:46,062
We're not taking
that to the meet.

94
00:11:46,064 --> 00:11:48,932
How are we gonna get there?

95
00:11:50,301 --> 00:11:51,935
I'll drive.

96
00:11:51,937 --> 00:11:53,269
My car.

97
00:11:53,271 --> 00:11:53,903
Why?

98
00:11:53,905 --> 00:11:56,206
This business
requires restraint.

99
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:59,909
That is
the opposite of restraint.

100
00:12:01,145 --> 00:12:03,113
But I like it.

101
00:12:03,115 --> 00:12:03,980
I mean, I'm proud of it.

102
00:12:03,982 --> 00:12:08,284
Good. Then you be proud of it on
your own time, but not with me.

103
00:12:08,286 --> 00:12:10,620
I'm not getting in that.

104
00:12:12,757 --> 00:12:15,492
Okay. Then don't.

105
00:12:16,594 --> 00:12:17,694
Honestly,

106
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:19,629
you don't really do anything.

107
00:12:19,631 --> 00:12:22,932
I've been paying you
the salary of three people

108
00:12:22,934 --> 00:12:25,001
to just stand behind me.

109
00:12:25,003 --> 00:12:26,936
You know?
And these last few deals...

110
00:12:26,938 --> 00:12:29,239
This Nacho fella,
he's been comin' alone.

111
00:12:29,241 --> 00:12:31,775
I mean, if he
doesn't need backup men,

112
00:12:31,777 --> 00:12:35,011
then,
I mean, why do I need you?

113
00:12:35,013 --> 00:12:35,779
I should just go alone.

114
00:12:35,781 --> 00:12:37,881
I'm throwing...
I'm throwing away money.

115
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:41,751
Just tossing it
away into the trash.

116
00:12:42,319 --> 00:12:44,721
Look,
you do whatever you want,

117
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:45,422
but I'm advising you,

118
00:12:45,424 --> 00:12:48,591
do not go to that meet without
someone watching your back.

119
00:12:48,593 --> 00:12:50,694
Yeah, well, of course
you're gonna say that.

120
00:12:50,696 --> 00:12:53,663
I mean, you don't want to be
out of this easy-peasy job.

121
00:12:53,665 --> 00:12:57,600
Well, I'm sorry,
but this is the gravy train,

122
00:12:57,602 --> 00:13:00,570
and it's leaving
the station right now.

123
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:03,073
So, last chance.

124
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,576
All aboard.

125
00:13:10,281 --> 00:13:11,514
Seriously, last chance.

126
00:13:11,516 --> 00:13:15,919
I'm gonna count to,
say, 10, and then I'm...

127
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:16,853
All right, then.

128
00:13:16,855 --> 00:13:20,256
Your services are
no longer needed.

129
00:14:04,502 --> 00:14:06,035
<i>Hola.</i>

130
00:14:08,739 --> 00:14:10,073
No old guy?

131
00:14:10,075 --> 00:14:11,908
What, did he break
a hip or something?

132
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,877
I know, right?

133
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:15,345
Yeah, no, we...

134
00:14:15,347 --> 00:14:16,946
We parted ways.

135
00:14:16,948 --> 00:14:19,048
Yeah, saw things differently.

136
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:21,751
So... You know how it is.

137
00:14:34,298 --> 00:14:36,599
This is interesting.

138
00:14:36,901 --> 00:14:39,169
Oh, yeah.
You like it?

139
00:14:39,403 --> 00:14:40,503
Can I take a look?

140
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:42,405
Oh, be my guest. Get in.

141
00:14:42,407 --> 00:14:44,541
Check it out.

142
00:14:47,545 --> 00:14:49,078
Wow.

143
00:14:54,051 --> 00:14:55,885
- Impressive.
- Thank you.

144
00:14:55,887 --> 00:14:58,588
Get in. Feel the leather.

145
00:14:59,323 --> 00:15:01,457
Yeah, it's a H2.

146
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:02,492
Brand-new, off the line.

147
00:15:02,494 --> 00:15:06,229
Slimmer than the H1,
but longer, more height.

148
00:15:06,231 --> 00:15:07,864
Yeah, it's a honey.

149
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:10,934
V8 engine, 325 horsepower,

150
00:15:10,936 --> 00:15:12,669
tri-zone climate controls.

151
00:15:12,671 --> 00:15:14,871
So, you can have
a girl in a bikini

152
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:18,408
and another in a parka, and
they're both gonna be comfortable.

153
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:21,578
You're running around with
two girls in your SUV?

154
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,213
You'd be really
comfortable, huh?

155
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:25,748
Oh, yeah. Yes.

156
00:15:25,816 --> 00:15:27,517
I'm gonna count this quick.

157
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,587
Do your thing.
Make sure it's right.

158
00:15:43,367 --> 00:15:45,301
Okey-dokey.

159
00:15:45,469 --> 00:15:47,437
We are good.

160
00:15:48,272 --> 00:15:50,406
Uh, same as before.

161
00:15:50,474 --> 00:15:52,075
Still factory-sealed.

162
00:15:52,077 --> 00:15:55,812
And, as always,
you're welcome to count 'em.

163
00:15:56,013 --> 00:15:57,313
I trust you.

164
00:15:57,315 --> 00:15:59,649
Great. Thank you.

165
00:16:01,719 --> 00:16:03,953
See you next time.

166
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:52,068
Hello? Yes.

167
00:16:53,337 --> 00:16:55,038
No. Sorry. Uh...

168
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,709
Yes, this is James McGill, but
I'm no longer a lawyer, so...

169
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:03,112
That's right, not a lawyer.
Bye.

170
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:10,453
So, this is what
a midlife crisis looks like?

171
00:17:10,721 --> 00:17:12,889
Not midlife crisis.

172
00:17:12,891 --> 00:17:13,990
Clarity.

173
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:15,158
Midlife clarity.

174
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,060
Clarity? Uh...

175
00:17:17,062 --> 00:17:18,661
Clearly explain to
me why you walked out

176
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:21,631
on the best job
opportunity of your life.

177
00:17:23,867 --> 00:17:26,369
Get in the pool,
and I'll tell ya.

178
00:17:26,371 --> 00:17:27,170
Get in the pool?

179
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:29,238
Yeah. Come on.

180
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,008
Just pop in the gift shop
and buy a bathing suit.

181
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,776
Get a one-piece,
nothing fancy.

182
00:17:33,778 --> 00:17:35,545
The water is perfect.

183
00:17:35,547 --> 00:17:36,079
It's 82 degrees.

184
00:17:36,081 --> 00:17:38,815
You can order a drink.
And you got to try this crab dip...

185
00:17:38,817 --> 00:17:40,183
Why are you
acting like this?

186
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:42,085
I'm not acting like anything.

187
00:17:42,087 --> 00:17:45,588
I just finally
decided to be me.

188
00:17:45,889 --> 00:17:50,360
Everything okay, Mr. Cumpston?
Would you like another drink?

189
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:52,829
No, I'm good with this.

190
00:17:55,566 --> 00:17:57,867
I'll tell you what,
Mr. Cumpston.

191
00:17:57,869 --> 00:18:00,436
If you really want to talk,
I'll be in the bar.

192
00:18:00,438 --> 00:18:02,405
Not for long.

193
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:09,445
Hey, Rolando.
Check.

194
00:18:11,248 --> 00:18:15,184
What... What do you mean,
"quit the law"?

195
00:18:15,186 --> 00:18:16,486
I quit it.
Simple as that.

196
00:18:16,488 --> 00:18:20,356
Oh, well, thanks for explaining,
Jimmy. It's super-clear now.

197
00:18:20,358 --> 00:18:21,958
Hey, buddy?

198
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,593
Is that
a misprint right there?

199
00:18:23,595 --> 00:18:24,460
It's got to be, right?

200
00:18:24,462 --> 00:18:25,461
The Zafiro Anejo?
Yeah.

201
00:18:25,463 --> 00:18:27,663
That's correct,
actually, believe it or not.

202
00:18:27,665 --> 00:18:31,167
Holy shit.
A $50 shot of tequila?

203
00:18:31,169 --> 00:18:32,402
Is it worth it?

204
00:18:32,404 --> 00:18:33,002
Apparently.

205
00:18:33,004 --> 00:18:34,837
I mean, it's kind of a
personal choice kind of thing.

206
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:39,108
Well, I can't die without
trying a $50 shot of tequila,

207
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,209
so, two, <i> dos,</i> neat.

208
00:18:40,211 --> 00:18:43,079
And we can charge that
to the room, can't we?

209
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:44,647
No, we can't.

210
00:18:44,649 --> 00:18:46,115
We...

211
00:18:46,984 --> 00:18:47,650
I am paying.

212
00:18:47,652 --> 00:18:50,620
And he will be having a shot
of your well brand,

213
00:18:50,622 --> 00:18:52,722
and I'll have
a glass of your house red.

214
00:18:52,724 --> 00:18:56,125
We have a Cabernet,
a Pinot, and a Syrah.

215
00:18:56,326 --> 00:18:58,394
Whatever. Dealer's choice.

216
00:18:58,396 --> 00:19:00,029
Something with alcohol.

217
00:19:00,031 --> 00:19:01,597
You got it.

218
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,603
Jimmy.

219
00:19:07,671 --> 00:19:08,938
Did something
happen in Cicero?

220
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,907
Why did something
have to happen in Cicero?

221
00:19:10,909 --> 00:19:13,743
Because when I talked to you
about Davis and Main,

222
00:19:13,745 --> 00:19:14,577
you were ready
to take the job.

223
00:19:14,579 --> 00:19:17,280
Now you're back, and you're
suddenly quitting the law,

224
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:20,450
cheating hotels out
of expensive liquor,

225
00:19:20,452 --> 00:19:22,285
wearing a weird pinkie ring?

226
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:24,821
What,
are you in the Mafia now?

227
00:19:26,924 --> 00:19:29,659
Asking if we have a future.

228
00:19:29,661 --> 00:19:33,429
I mean,
where did that come from?

229
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,466
I don't know. I just...

230
00:19:36,567 --> 00:19:39,769
Well, Cicero has
nothing to do with it.

231
00:19:39,837 --> 00:19:40,803
It's my whole life.

232
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:44,273
Well, my life since Chuck mad
me come to Albuquerque.

233
00:19:44,275 --> 00:19:49,011
Ever since I got here, all I've done
is try to make Chuck happy,

234
00:19:49,013 --> 00:19:52,014
bend over
backwards to please Chuck.

235
00:19:52,016 --> 00:19:53,816
Chuck, Chuck, Chuck.

236
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:55,151
Well, no more.

237
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:59,055
You quitting the law, isn't that
exactly what Chuck wants?

238
00:19:59,057 --> 00:20:00,189
Who cares?

239
00:20:00,191 --> 00:20:01,958
This is for me, okay?

240
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,861
I got into the law
for all the wrong reasons.

241
00:20:04,863 --> 00:20:06,529
I'm trusting my instincts.

242
00:20:06,531 --> 00:20:09,799
I think that my talents
are better spent elsewhere.

243
00:20:09,801 --> 00:20:13,169
Where? Floating in
somebody else's pool?

244
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:17,707
Jimmy, you're a great lawyer.

245
00:20:17,709 --> 00:20:18,641
Why give that up?

246
00:20:18,643 --> 00:20:21,544
I'm not saying it
didn't have its moments,

247
00:20:21,546 --> 00:20:22,845
but the stuff I
liked about it,

248
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,046
selling people,
convincing people,

249
00:20:24,048 --> 00:20:26,849
I don't have to be
a lawyer to do that.

250
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:30,386
Besides, people tell
me how they see me,

251
00:20:30,388 --> 00:20:32,221
and it's not as a lawyer.

252
00:20:32,223 --> 00:20:33,956
All right.

253
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,324
Here you go.
Thank you.

254
00:20:35,326 --> 00:20:38,327
Let me know if I can get you
guys anything else, okay?

255
00:20:38,329 --> 00:20:40,329
Bobby,
what up, brother man?

256
00:20:40,331 --> 00:20:42,131
Thanks.

257
00:20:42,466 --> 00:20:44,300
Short it.

258
00:20:44,801 --> 00:20:46,469
Short it.

259
00:20:46,471 --> 00:20:47,904
Short it. Short that shit.

260
00:20:47,906 --> 00:20:49,705
That stock is useless.
It's got no legs.

261
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:51,607
It's like a circus
freak minus the fun.

262
00:20:51,609 --> 00:20:54,043
And that one's even worse.
Who's giving you these?

263
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:55,545
Please do me a favor.
Take a pillow,

264
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:57,713
put it over
that stock's face

265
00:20:57,715 --> 00:20:59,515
until you hear
the deathbed queef.

266
00:20:59,517 --> 00:21:00,716
Okay, so...

267
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:03,085
If you're not gonna be
a lawyer, then what?

268
00:21:03,087 --> 00:21:06,789
Float around and wait for your
Sandpiper money to roll in?

269
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:08,457
No.
That could take years.

270
00:21:08,459 --> 00:21:12,228
Sandpiper has no
bearing on this at all.

271
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:15,498
Okay, then,
what's the plan?

272
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:17,300
To be open to the universe.

273
00:21:17,302 --> 00:21:18,000
Okay, so no plan.

274
00:21:18,002 --> 00:21:21,404
Just walk the Earth, like Jules
at the end of <i>Pulp Fiction?</i>

275
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:24,173
Look, whatever
the universe presents,

276
00:21:24,175 --> 00:21:26,576
whatever opportunity arises,

277
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:27,310
I will take it.

278
00:21:27,312 --> 00:21:28,344
Whatever opportunity?
Yeah.

279
00:21:28,346 --> 00:21:30,313
Wasn't Davis and Main
an opportunity?

280
00:21:30,315 --> 00:21:34,717
It's a great opportunity,
and you're walking away from it.

281
00:21:35,986 --> 00:21:39,589
Look, shouldn't you at least try
the job before you say no?

282
00:21:39,591 --> 00:21:41,657
And waste everyone's time,
including my own?

283
00:21:41,659 --> 00:21:45,761
Kim, I appreciate your concern,
but it's not for me.

284
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:46,295
I don't want it.

285
00:21:46,297 --> 00:21:49,532
Jimmy, do you remember how
long you studied for that bar?

286
00:21:49,534 --> 00:21:51,367
How hard you worked?
Yeah.

287
00:21:51,369 --> 00:21:54,337
All that effort, you're just
gonna toss it away?

288
00:21:54,339 --> 00:21:57,006
That's the sunk cost fallacy.

289
00:21:57,008 --> 00:21:57,907
Wait, the what?

290
00:21:57,909 --> 00:22:00,042
The fallacy of sunk cost.

291
00:22:00,044 --> 00:22:01,244
It's what gamblers do.

292
00:22:01,246 --> 00:22:02,712
They throw good
money after bad

293
00:22:02,714 --> 00:22:04,113
thinking they can
turn their luck around.

294
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:08,517
It's like, "I've already spent this
much money or time, whatever.

295
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:09,619
"I got to keep going."

296
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:12,388
No, there's no reward
at the end of this game.

297
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:14,890
You are making a mistake.

298
00:22:14,892 --> 00:22:16,158
I know you're
making a mistake.

299
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,061
I've been doing the right thing
for all these years now,

300
00:22:19,063 --> 00:22:20,096
and where has it gotten me?

301
00:22:20,098 --> 00:22:23,032
Nowhere.
I'm sorry. I don't...

302
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:27,970
It's not my thing.

303
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:29,739
I don't get it.
I just don't get it.

304
00:22:29,741 --> 00:22:32,275
It's what's right for me.

305
00:22:32,277 --> 00:22:34,744
Donkey balls.

306
00:22:35,045 --> 00:22:36,078
Pure donkey balls, dude.

307
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,948
Wall Street's for suckers.
Who needs that aggravation?

308
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:41,617
If the Oracle doesn't have to live
there, then I sure as hell don't.

309
00:22:41,619 --> 00:22:43,819
I can make
a million-dollar stock trade

310
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:44,954
on my laptop
sitting on a toilet.

311
00:22:44,956 --> 00:22:48,024
Like Midas, shitting gold
bricks on my throne.

312
00:22:48,026 --> 00:22:50,860
That's why Speigelman and
Deitch want my business so bad.

313
00:22:50,862 --> 00:22:52,628
I'm a golden God.

314
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:53,963
Look,
of course I remember that.

315
00:22:53,965 --> 00:22:54,930
Who forgets
a thing like that?

316
00:22:54,932 --> 00:22:57,566
That fart had the anger of a
repressed minority community.

317
00:22:57,568 --> 00:22:59,168
You fart like that
in someone's face,

318
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,803
you're gonna give
them pink eye for life.

319
00:23:02,739 --> 00:23:04,340
Good convo, bro.

320
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:06,575
Till next time, brother man.

321
00:23:06,577 --> 00:23:08,077
Come with me.

322
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:10,813
What?
Just come on. Trust me.

323
00:23:11,148 --> 00:23:12,615
What are you gonna do?

324
00:23:12,617 --> 00:23:15,217
You want to understand
what I'm talking about?

325
00:23:15,219 --> 00:23:17,019
Follow my lead.

326
00:23:25,462 --> 00:23:29,165
Hey, buddy,
could you settle a bet for us?

327
00:23:29,266 --> 00:23:30,032
A what?
Sorry.

328
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:33,736
I don't want to make it sound like I
was eavesdropping, but I kind of was.

329
00:23:33,738 --> 00:23:36,772
We heard you
talking about stocks.

330
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,841
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, so, a question,

331
00:23:38,843 --> 00:23:42,411
if you could settle a debate
between me and my sister.

332
00:23:42,413 --> 00:23:44,680
All right. You know what? We probably
shouldn't even bother this man.

333
00:23:44,682 --> 00:23:47,583
We wouldn't normally do this, right?
But we need an expert.

334
00:23:47,585 --> 00:23:50,853
This guy sounds like
he knows his stuff.

335
00:23:51,855 --> 00:23:53,155
Yeah, go.

336
00:23:53,157 --> 00:23:54,223
Okay. Here's the question.

337
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:57,059
When it comes to the
stock market, is there, like,

338
00:23:57,061 --> 00:24:02,031
a financial limit to how much
a person's allowed to invest?

339
00:24:02,966 --> 00:24:04,533
A limit?

340
00:24:04,801 --> 00:24:06,035
No.

341
00:24:06,037 --> 00:24:07,036
No limit.
Knew it.

342
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:08,537
Oh, even if it's
an inheritance?

343
00:24:08,539 --> 00:24:12,108
You know, with, like, inheritance
taxes and whatnot?

344
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,175
No. Same.

345
00:24:13,177 --> 00:24:14,377
That's, oh, fantastic.

346
00:24:14,379 --> 00:24:16,746
Thank you, buddy.
See? No limit.

347
00:24:16,748 --> 00:24:18,914
Told you we
could invest it all.

348
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,449
And it's a smart move, too.

349
00:24:20,451 --> 00:24:22,051
Sticking it all in the bank?

350
00:24:22,053 --> 00:24:23,119
No.
Um, yeah.

351
00:24:23,121 --> 00:24:25,321
You can invest
all your money.

352
00:24:25,323 --> 00:24:27,757
Just make sure
you diversify.

353
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:30,025
Yeah. Diversify.

354
00:24:30,227 --> 00:24:32,027
That's... We got to...

355
00:24:32,029 --> 00:24:35,464
Hey, what do you mean,
"diversify"?

356
00:24:35,466 --> 00:24:37,233
Well, diversify is...

357
00:24:37,235 --> 00:24:38,134
You know that saying,

358
00:24:38,136 --> 00:24:40,936
"Don't put all your eggs in
one basket," right?

359
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:41,971
Same principle.

360
00:24:41,973 --> 00:24:43,272
No, it makes complete sense.
Thank you.

361
00:24:43,274 --> 00:24:46,008
Now, if I had an idea of the money
we're talking about, ballpark,

362
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:50,312
I could give you examples
of smart diversification.

363
00:24:50,847 --> 00:24:52,348
Yeah, um...

364
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:56,118
Look, an uncle on our father's side
recently passed,

365
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:00,923
and he left us somewhere
in the neighborhood

366
00:25:00,925 --> 00:25:03,058
of $1.4 million.

367
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,527
And I don't mean
to be greedy,

368
00:25:04,529 --> 00:25:07,396
but I think if we
invest it smart now,

369
00:25:07,398 --> 00:25:08,697
we could double it,
triple it,

370
00:25:08,699 --> 00:25:12,902
we could quadruple
the whole inheritance, right?

371
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:14,470
In my opinion?

372
00:25:14,472 --> 00:25:16,505
Fortune favors
the bold, man.

373
00:25:16,507 --> 00:25:18,674
Now, if you guys are free
to join me for a drink,

374
00:25:18,676 --> 00:25:20,476
I can give you a quick consult.
That's all right.

375
00:25:20,478 --> 00:25:21,877
We were gonna do
it ourselves through

376
00:25:21,879 --> 00:25:23,279
one of those online
brokerage websites.

377
00:25:23,281 --> 00:25:26,282
We're just gonna
pick a classic, like,

378
00:25:26,284 --> 00:25:27,516
I think they're
called blue-chip stocks?

379
00:25:27,518 --> 00:25:30,119
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
you can totally do it yourself.

380
00:25:30,121 --> 00:25:31,353
Shoot for the tried
and true.

381
00:25:31,355 --> 00:25:33,622
'Course, you might be putting your
cash in the<i> Hindenburg,</i>

382
00:25:33,624 --> 00:25:37,493
the<i> Andrea Doria,
Corky Romano.</i>Right?

383
00:25:37,495 --> 00:25:41,197
They all seemed rock-solid
beforehand, but then...

384
00:25:41,598 --> 00:25:42,898
Yeah, not good.

385
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,467
Not good, yeah.

386
00:25:44,469 --> 00:25:45,201
So, how do you know?

387
00:25:45,203 --> 00:25:48,270
Well, that's where
someone like myself comes in.

388
00:25:48,272 --> 00:25:50,339
Proven track record
as a wealth manager.

389
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:52,608
I take calculated
but aggressive risks

390
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:55,244
'cause I want to
catch lightning.

391
00:25:55,246 --> 00:25:56,078
And I do.

392
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,113
Practically
a money-printing machine.

393
00:25:58,115 --> 00:25:59,648
That sounds good.

394
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:01,817
A money-printing machine.

395
00:26:01,819 --> 00:26:04,587
Listen, there's
a little booth over here.

396
00:26:04,589 --> 00:26:05,754
There's some privacy.
We can talk.

397
00:26:05,756 --> 00:26:10,159
No obligations. We can just
rap about this a little bit.

398
00:26:10,161 --> 00:26:12,361
Yeah, I guess.
Yeah?

399
00:26:12,762 --> 00:26:14,797
What do you say, sis?

400
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:17,366
Can we just talk?

401
00:26:19,636 --> 00:26:20,936
Electric slide on
in there.

402
00:26:20,938 --> 00:26:22,338
And we'll just
rap a little bit.

403
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,573
It's no...
My name's Ken, by the way.

404
00:26:24,575 --> 00:26:26,308
Uh, Viktor, with a "K."

405
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:28,978
Cool. Viktor with a "K."

406
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,614
And this lovely lady is?

407
00:26:33,617 --> 00:26:35,651
It's Giselle.

408
00:26:35,653 --> 00:26:37,319
Giselle Saint Claire.

409
00:26:37,321 --> 00:26:38,988
Ah, lovely.

410
00:26:39,689 --> 00:26:41,824
Please, sit.

411
00:26:41,826 --> 00:26:43,225
I won't bite.

412
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:47,730
So, Viktor with a "K"
and Giselle... Exotic names.

413
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:49,398
They're Dutch.

414
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,633
Well, Boer,
to be precise.

415
00:26:50,635 --> 00:26:53,135
Our father's side of the
family is from South Africa,

416
00:26:53,137 --> 00:26:57,406
which is where Uncle
Humphrey passed away.

417
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,173
Oh, South Africa.

418
00:26:58,175 --> 00:27:01,644
They grow them beautiful down
there, right? Charlize Theron.

419
00:27:01,646 --> 00:27:02,778
And you.

420
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,513
Oh, well...

421
00:27:04,916 --> 00:27:06,882
I've never actually been,
but hope to go someday.

422
00:27:06,884 --> 00:27:09,318
Tell you what, by the time
I'm done with you two,

423
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:12,121
you might be taking
your own private jet.

424
00:27:12,123 --> 00:27:13,022
Nice.

425
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:13,889
Excuse me. Hi.

426
00:27:13,891 --> 00:27:14,823
Uh, we are sitting here now,

427
00:27:14,825 --> 00:27:17,426
so we could use a wine list,
if you get a chance...

428
00:27:17,428 --> 00:27:19,995
Hey, are you a tequila fan?

429
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:23,065
Yes.
You down for that?

430
00:27:23,633 --> 00:27:25,134
You ever try Zafiro Anejo?

431
00:27:25,136 --> 00:27:27,436
No, I have not,
but I'm down for whatever.

432
00:27:27,438 --> 00:27:29,071
Three of
whatever she just said.

433
00:27:29,073 --> 00:27:31,273
You got it.
All right.

434
00:27:31,508 --> 00:27:34,043
So, stock market.
A great investment.

435
00:27:34,045 --> 00:27:35,778
And you're picking
the right time to jump in.

436
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:38,414
Why do you listen to me?
I'm an idiot.

437
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:41,050
And talks about his cars,
talks about...

438
00:27:41,052 --> 00:27:43,185
How many cars did he have?

439
00:27:43,187 --> 00:27:46,221
I don't think...

440
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:48,490
It doesn't make sense.

441
00:27:48,492 --> 00:27:50,392
That's it, Ken.

442
00:27:50,394 --> 00:27:51,093
Oh, yeah.

443
00:27:51,095 --> 00:27:52,695
Compliments of the bartender.

444
00:27:52,697 --> 00:27:54,063
She thought you
might want a souvenir.

445
00:27:54,065 --> 00:27:56,465
Oh, my God. Did we drink
the entire bottle?

446
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:57,600
Not yet, we didn't.

447
00:27:57,602 --> 00:27:59,101
Hey, hey, cheers.

448
00:27:59,103 --> 00:28:02,037
I think we're
ready for the check.

449
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:06,909
Oh!

450
00:28:06,911 --> 00:28:10,212
Now, really,
it's the smart way to go.

451
00:28:10,214 --> 00:28:12,481
But, so, to be clear,

452
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:16,318
you take the money directly
from our account and invest it.

453
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,987
Diversify.
Diversify it.

454
00:28:17,989 --> 00:28:20,456
And then all the dividends
and all the profits

455
00:28:20,458 --> 00:28:24,126
and the what-have-you
comes back into our account.

456
00:28:24,128 --> 00:28:26,028
Boom, absolutely.

457
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,463
And you'll get
a detailed statement

458
00:28:27,465 --> 00:28:29,064
showing you how much
your money is growing,

459
00:28:29,066 --> 00:28:31,066
biggest bulls of the month,
et cetera.

460
00:28:31,068 --> 00:28:32,968
Ken, buddy,

461
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,671
let's do this.

462
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:37,172
Great.

463
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:39,808
Right there, Viktor with a "K,"
and, Giselle, you are next.

464
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:41,410
This is so exciting.
Mmm-hmm.

465
00:28:41,412 --> 00:28:42,611
Folks, it's been
a pleasure.

466
00:28:42,613 --> 00:28:44,780
Oops, I got that.
Can't let you do it, son.

467
00:28:44,782 --> 00:28:46,081
Wait. What?

468
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:47,583
Ken, you are the greatest.

469
00:28:47,585 --> 00:28:48,651
- Thank you.
<i>- No problemo.</i>

470
00:28:48,653 --> 00:28:51,120
Hey, this will be the best
decision you'll ever make.

471
00:28:51,122 --> 00:28:51,820
Oh, I believe it.

472
00:28:51,822 --> 00:28:53,822
All right, well, we should
get out of your hair.

473
00:28:53,824 --> 00:28:56,225
Yeah.
Wait, wait.

474
00:28:56,227 --> 00:28:58,894
This is for you. Now,
that's got all my contact info.

475
00:28:58,896 --> 00:29:03,298
Call me anytime with
questions or anything at all.

476
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,035
Ken.
Bye.

477
00:29:06,037 --> 00:29:07,302
Call me, guys.
Bye.

478
00:29:07,304 --> 00:29:09,571
Try and stop us.

479
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:12,741
Wow.

480
00:29:14,512 --> 00:29:16,378
Just wow.

481
00:29:30,126 --> 00:29:31,593
Hey.

482
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:34,596
What...

483
00:29:34,598 --> 00:29:35,864
Is this right?

484
00:29:35,866 --> 00:29:38,133
Yes, sir, it is.

485
00:29:43,006 --> 00:29:45,074
Go, go, go, go, go.

486
00:29:46,577 --> 00:29:48,210
Zafiro Anejo.

487
00:29:48,212 --> 00:29:50,879
Shh. He's gonna come out.

488
00:29:51,181 --> 00:29:52,081
Oh, no.

489
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:54,917
- I didn't read the fine print.
- Wait.

490
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:56,518
Yeah.

491
00:29:58,221 --> 00:29:59,088
Holy crap.

492
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:01,356
I can't...

493
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,034
Can I borrow that
when you're done?

494
00:30:46,269 --> 00:30:48,403
No, that's gross.

495
00:30:48,405 --> 00:30:51,840
How is it gross? Our germs
have already intermingled.

496
00:30:51,842 --> 00:30:54,176
It's my toothbrush.
It's different.

497
00:30:55,212 --> 00:30:56,979
Why is it different?

498
00:30:56,981 --> 00:30:58,347
Because.

499
00:30:58,349 --> 00:31:01,150
You know,
gums bleed, and there's...

500
00:31:01,152 --> 00:31:03,318
There's cold sores,

501
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,120
all sorts of food and...

502
00:31:05,122 --> 00:31:06,855
Come on.
What? No.

503
00:31:06,857 --> 00:31:08,123
Come on.
I'll do it right now.

504
00:31:08,125 --> 00:31:10,025
I don't care.
I need to brush my teeth.

505
00:31:10,027 --> 00:31:12,060
I don't have an extra.
It's not my problem.

506
00:31:12,062 --> 00:31:13,595
That's fine.

507
00:31:13,597 --> 00:31:15,230
I got this.

508
00:31:19,235 --> 00:31:20,869
Good. I'm fine with this.

509
00:31:20,871 --> 00:31:21,770
Yeah, me, too.

510
00:31:21,772 --> 00:31:23,872
Wait till you see
what I floss with.

511
00:31:45,261 --> 00:31:47,596
That's a keeper.

512
00:31:47,598 --> 00:31:50,666
Thank you,
Viktor with a "K."

513
00:31:52,136 --> 00:31:56,505
Hey, wouldn't it be great if we
could do that every night?

514
00:31:56,507 --> 00:31:58,607
Yes, it would.

515
00:32:00,977 --> 00:32:04,046
But we can't.

516
00:32:06,349 --> 00:32:07,282
I know, yeah.

517
00:32:07,284 --> 00:32:11,420
But I'm just saying,
if we could, it would be great.

518
00:32:12,455 --> 00:32:14,823
But I know we can't.

519
00:32:14,825 --> 00:32:17,893
Oh, crap.
I can't be late today.

520
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:20,929
Howard is doling
out assignments,

521
00:32:20,931 --> 00:32:22,464
and the last one
through the door

522
00:32:22,466 --> 00:32:25,467
could get stuck in doc review.

523
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:31,240
You got somewhere to go?

524
00:32:31,242 --> 00:32:34,676
Yeah. Uh, yeah,
I got somewhere.

525
00:32:43,386 --> 00:32:45,020
You good?

526
00:32:45,022 --> 00:32:47,222
Yeah. All good.

527
00:33:21,991 --> 00:33:25,560
Daniel Wormald? I'm Officer Baker.
This is Officer Saxton.

528
00:33:25,562 --> 00:33:28,397
Yeah, please. Come on in.

529
00:33:29,532 --> 00:33:32,100
Come in. It's over here.

530
00:33:32,235 --> 00:33:33,201
See what they did?

531
00:33:33,203 --> 00:33:36,705
I mean, all gone.
All of them, just...

532
00:33:36,707 --> 00:33:37,873
Uh... What's all gone?

533
00:33:37,875 --> 00:33:41,243
I have.. I had a baseball
card collection.

534
00:33:41,245 --> 00:33:43,912
A major collection,
all stolen.

535
00:33:43,914 --> 00:33:44,646
Oh, sorry to hear that.

536
00:33:44,648 --> 00:33:48,183
Was it common knowledge
that you have baseball cards?

537
00:33:48,185 --> 00:33:49,151
No, not really.

538
00:33:49,153 --> 00:33:52,621
So, nobody in particular
you can think of wanted 'em?

539
00:33:52,623 --> 00:33:54,690
No. Not that I...

540
00:33:54,692 --> 00:33:55,724
No.

541
00:33:55,726 --> 00:33:56,658
How'd they get in?

542
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,061
Uh, the back door over here.

543
00:33:59,063 --> 00:34:01,763
It was open when I
came home for lunch.

544
00:34:01,765 --> 00:34:02,965
I mean, it was locked,

545
00:34:02,967 --> 00:34:06,201
but they must have
jimmied it open or something.

546
00:34:06,203 --> 00:34:07,102
Uh-huh.

547
00:34:07,104 --> 00:34:08,837
At what time
you figure this happened?

548
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:13,041
I left for work at 8:15,
came home for lunch at 12:30,

549
00:34:13,043 --> 00:34:14,309
and called you immediately.

550
00:34:14,311 --> 00:34:15,644
Was anything else taken?

551
00:34:15,646 --> 00:34:17,412
Cash, a fair bit, uh...

552
00:34:17,414 --> 00:34:19,381
How much cash?

553
00:34:19,383 --> 00:34:20,649
Uh, I don't know.

554
00:34:20,651 --> 00:34:22,818
Let's focus on
what's important here.

555
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:26,188
You know, all I really care
about are my baseball cards.

556
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,156
You know,
I have a Topps Mickey Mantle

557
00:34:28,158 --> 00:34:30,559
rookie card
that's irreplaceable.

558
00:34:30,561 --> 00:34:34,062
It's a mint,
60/40, 90/10 on the reverse.

559
00:34:34,064 --> 00:34:35,097
I can go on.

560
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:35,998
All my cards are
in top-loaders,

561
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,735
but if they're taken out
and exposed to the elements,

562
00:34:39,737 --> 00:34:42,037
I mean,
or creased, God forbid.

563
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:43,672
I mean, you're
looking at a nine-point

564
00:34:43,674 --> 00:34:45,941
downgrade in
a matter of seconds.

565
00:34:45,943 --> 00:34:47,209
I understand
the first 48 hours

566
00:34:47,211 --> 00:34:50,445
are the most important
in investigations like this.

567
00:34:50,447 --> 00:34:52,180
So, the more time passes,

568
00:34:52,182 --> 00:34:55,250
I mean, the less likely
we are of a recovery.

569
00:34:55,252 --> 00:34:58,487
So, time is of
the essence here, guys.

570
00:34:58,489 --> 00:35:02,991
Well, we're gonna help you
out the best we can, Mr. Wormald.

571
00:35:02,993 --> 00:35:04,393
Good.

572
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,628
Well, they really tossed this place.

573
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:10,866
I mean, are you sure they weren't
looking for anything else?

574
00:35:10,868 --> 00:35:11,800
Like what?

575
00:35:11,802 --> 00:35:15,337
I don't know.
Just wondering your thoughts.

576
00:35:15,339 --> 00:35:17,105
I assume more baseball cards.

577
00:35:17,107 --> 00:35:18,040
Did you have
more baseball cards

578
00:35:18,042 --> 00:35:20,075
than the ones you keep
locked in that case here?

579
00:35:20,077 --> 00:35:21,843
Yes, in back. Thousands.

580
00:35:21,845 --> 00:35:25,080
But these were
the crown jewels over here.

581
00:35:25,082 --> 00:35:27,516
The all-star lineup.

582
00:35:27,984 --> 00:35:29,518
Right.

583
00:35:29,952 --> 00:35:31,420
Hmm.

584
00:35:32,488 --> 00:35:33,455
What?

585
00:35:33,457 --> 00:35:35,357
Just trying to make sense of it.

586
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:36,391
What's to make sense of?

587
00:35:36,393 --> 00:35:37,859
I mean, isn't it as
simple as the perp

588
00:35:37,861 --> 00:35:40,128
was looking for
more baseball cards?

589
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:42,230
Or hopped up on
speed or whatever

590
00:35:42,232 --> 00:35:45,167
and went nuts
with the vandalism?

591
00:35:45,169 --> 00:35:47,903
Yeah. I mean,
that could be.

592
00:35:47,905 --> 00:35:49,371
Yeah.

593
00:35:49,505 --> 00:35:52,274
Pretty sweet Hummer
parked in the driveway.

594
00:35:52,276 --> 00:35:53,341
That yours?

595
00:35:53,343 --> 00:35:54,709
Yeah, that's mine.

596
00:35:54,711 --> 00:35:56,745
Uh, it's a lease.

597
00:35:57,346 --> 00:35:59,848
Got a great deal on it.

598
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:02,617
It's very sweet.

599
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:05,754
They say Arnold Schwarzenegger
is the reason that Hummers exist.

600
00:36:05,756 --> 00:36:08,056
I don't know how,
but that's what they say.

601
00:36:08,058 --> 00:36:09,524
No kidding.
Yeah.

602
00:36:09,526 --> 00:36:10,926
Uh...

603
00:36:10,928 --> 00:36:13,595
What kind of work do you do,
Mr. Wormald?

604
00:36:13,597 --> 00:36:18,733
Uh, I work IT for
a pharmaceutical company.

605
00:36:18,735 --> 00:36:20,969
Wow, computers.

606
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:22,571
God, I should've
gotten into computers.

607
00:36:22,573 --> 00:36:24,539
I'd have that same Hummer.
Yeah, right.

608
00:36:24,541 --> 00:36:28,009
Look, guys,
I'm glad you like my car.

609
00:36:28,011 --> 00:36:29,311
But I think
we're lookin' through

610
00:36:29,313 --> 00:36:31,012
the wrong end of
the telescope here.

611
00:36:31,014 --> 00:36:35,083
The priority is
my baseball cards.

612
00:36:35,085 --> 00:36:35,584
Of course.

613
00:36:35,586 --> 00:36:40,555
Yes, now, I have a detailed
manifest of my entire collection.

614
00:36:40,557 --> 00:36:43,024
And asterisks next to
the high-ticket items.

615
00:36:43,026 --> 00:36:46,728
So, it's clear which ones
they're gonna try to fence first.

616
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:47,929
'Cause they're super,
super valuable.

617
00:36:47,931 --> 00:36:52,634
So, you're gonna want to get this list
out to pawnshops, uh, collectors.

618
00:36:52,636 --> 00:36:57,772
Question anyone who's done any
sort of crime like this in the past.

619
00:36:57,774 --> 00:36:59,674
The usual suspects.

620
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:02,911
Uh, can I get you the list so
you can start investigating?

621
00:37:02,913 --> 00:37:05,280
Yeah, you... Yeah, if you
could get us that list...

622
00:37:05,282 --> 00:37:07,549
Okay, I'll print it out.

623
00:37:07,551 --> 00:37:09,084
Hank Aaron, mint.

624
00:37:09,086 --> 00:37:11,887
God, my signed Derek Jeter.

625
00:37:11,889 --> 00:37:13,488
Willie Mays, O-Pee-Chee.

626
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:16,324
Got to breathe.
Just keep breathing.

627
00:37:16,326 --> 00:37:17,192
Keep breathing.

628
00:37:17,194 --> 00:37:19,327
Okay.
I know, right?

629
00:37:19,795 --> 00:37:22,097
Left the TV.
Uh-huh.

630
00:37:22,099 --> 00:37:24,566
Left the computer.
Right.

631
00:37:27,069 --> 00:37:28,503
Uh...

632
00:37:33,442 --> 00:37:36,244
There's something
wrong with this picture.

633
00:39:01,364 --> 00:39:02,564
Hey, it's me.

634
00:39:02,566 --> 00:39:05,200
Another perfect day
in paradise out here.

635
00:39:05,202 --> 00:39:07,502
I'm in the pool.

636
00:39:07,504 --> 00:39:09,604
Okay, call me.

637
00:39:25,521 --> 00:39:27,222
Hi. How are you?
Hey, babe.

638
00:39:27,224 --> 00:39:29,190
Did you get lunch?
I did.

639
00:39:29,692 --> 00:39:31,226
I think I'm burning up back here.

640
00:39:31,228 --> 00:39:33,094
Really? Well, you're just in luck.

641
00:39:33,096 --> 00:39:35,330
- Look what I have.
- Oh, great.

642
00:39:38,368 --> 00:39:41,770
Oh, yeah, you're all red
back here. Yeah.

643
00:39:42,138 --> 00:39:43,471
That feels good, babe.

644
00:39:43,473 --> 00:39:46,775
I told you not to spend
so much time in the sun.

645
00:39:46,777 --> 00:39:48,977
You don't listen.

646
00:39:49,879 --> 00:39:50,945
Yeah, it's me again.

647
00:39:50,947 --> 00:39:56,151
Listen, as I speak,
not 25 feet away from me,

648
00:39:56,153 --> 00:39:58,153
I'm looking at the mark.

649
00:39:58,155 --> 00:40:02,290
Think Thurston Howell III
if he shacked up with Ginger.

650
00:40:02,292 --> 00:40:03,958
He's dripping in Gucci.

651
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:07,696
It's like I'm at the watering hole
and I'm watching the fattest,

652
00:40:07,698 --> 00:40:11,066
slowest water buffalo
expose his neck to me.

653
00:40:11,068 --> 00:40:13,902
And I'm the lioness
ready to strike.

654
00:40:13,904 --> 00:40:18,106
Come, Kim, join me.

655
00:40:18,108 --> 00:40:20,608
Join the pride.

656
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:27,449
Oh, I said "lioness" because it's
the females who do all the hunting.

657
00:40:27,451 --> 00:40:32,354
Uh, I just wanted to be species-accurate,
irrespective of my own sex.

658
00:40:32,356 --> 00:40:34,089
It's a National
Geographic thing.

659
00:40:34,091 --> 00:40:35,924
Anyway...

660
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:38,093
Get out here.

661
00:40:38,095 --> 00:40:40,195
Bye.

662
00:41:21,837 --> 00:41:26,441
Santa Fe, New Mexico.
I need the number of a law firm.

663
00:41:26,443 --> 00:41:28,443
Davis and Main.

664
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:31,446
Yeah, you can connect me.

665
00:43:09,144 --> 00:43:12,847
There are a few options
on the company cars.

666
00:43:12,849 --> 00:43:15,617
We can arrange a test drive
whenever you'd like.

667
00:43:15,619 --> 00:43:16,818
Company car. Wow.

668
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:19,187
And there's a service
that will deliver it

669
00:43:19,189 --> 00:43:20,755
right to you,
wherever you want.

670
00:43:20,757 --> 00:43:23,157
And if you find
you're not happy with it,

671
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:24,526
it's not a big
deal to change it out.

672
00:43:24,528 --> 00:43:27,395
That sounds really...

673
00:43:27,963 --> 00:43:29,497
Yeah.

674
00:43:37,373 --> 00:43:39,874
This is uh, interesting.

675
00:43:39,876 --> 00:43:40,975
Oh, if...

676
00:43:40,977 --> 00:43:43,044
If this isn't to
your taste,

677
00:43:43,046 --> 00:43:46,047
we have a collection of art in-house
you can choose from.

678
00:43:46,049 --> 00:43:49,117
Anytime you're ready,
I can put together some samples

679
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,318
for you to review.

680
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,220
I... No, I like this.

681
00:43:52,222 --> 00:43:56,324
Good. Well, any other
needs you have,

682
00:43:56,326 --> 00:43:57,025
I'm here to help.

683
00:43:57,027 --> 00:43:58,660
Office supplies,
dietary needs...

684
00:43:58,662 --> 00:44:02,397
Anything special you want
stocked in the fridge?

685
00:44:02,399 --> 00:44:06,034
Uh, maybe a humidifier?
Gets kind of dry in here.

686
00:44:06,036 --> 00:44:09,203
Omar, I'm pretty
low-maintenance.

687
00:44:09,205 --> 00:44:10,572
Sure.

688
00:44:10,574 --> 00:44:12,574
Well, if there's anything
you need,

689
00:44:12,576 --> 00:44:14,943
I'm right outside the door.

690
00:44:15,311 --> 00:44:16,277
Great.

691
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:17,779
If I think of anything.

692
00:44:17,781 --> 00:44:19,414
Good.

693
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:22,517
Hey, do you think...

694
00:44:22,519 --> 00:44:24,886
Uh, I'm just looking at this.

695
00:44:24,888 --> 00:44:27,889
Do we get a choice of desks?

696
00:44:27,891 --> 00:44:29,691
What were you thinking?

697
00:44:29,693 --> 00:44:32,293
Uh... Is it possible...

698
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:34,028
Um...

699
00:44:34,396 --> 00:44:37,498
Can we do a cocobolo?

700
00:44:37,866 --> 00:44:39,200
Cocobolo desk?

701
00:44:39,202 --> 00:44:41,869
Absolutely.
I'll get right on that.
