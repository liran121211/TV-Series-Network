1
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:15,610
<i>My husband and I scrimped and saved
for so many years.</i>

2
00:02:15,777 --> 00:02:17,821
<i>We did our best to build a nest-egg...</i>

3
00:02:17,988 --> 00:02:20,866
<i>...so that we wouldn't be
a burden to our family.</i>

4
00:02:21,033 --> 00:02:24,745
<i>After Ronald passed, I moved
to an assisted living facility.</i>

5
00:02:24,912 --> 00:02:26,496
<i>A nice place.</i>

6
00:02:26,663 --> 00:02:28,874
<i>They told me
they'd take care of everything...</i>

7
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:32,753
<i>...but then one day they said
all my money was gone.</i>

8
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,213
<i>How could that be?</i>

9
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,382
<i>Where did it all go?</i>

10
00:02:37,549 --> 00:02:40,969
<i>If you or a loved one is a resident
of a Sandpiper Crossing facility...</i>

11
00:02:41,136 --> 00:02:44,347
<i>- ...or associated retirement...</i>
- Jesus. You used your own voice?

12
00:02:44,556 --> 00:02:46,266
Strictly to save money.

13
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:48,143
- All in, the whole thing cost...
- Just.

14
00:02:48,309 --> 00:02:50,353
<i>Call the law offices
of Davis & Main...</i>

15
00:02:50,562 --> 00:02:53,107
<i>...at 505-242-7700.</i>

16
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:57,903
<i>That's 505-242-7700.</i>

17
00:02:59,738 --> 00:03:02,783
Production cost: $647, all in.

18
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,870
The one single airing
was a $700 ad buy, so dirt cheap.

19
00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:10,665
You think this is about money?
You think That's what this is about?

20
00:03:10,832 --> 00:03:13,293
I'm just trying to offer
complete information, here.

21
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:17,631
Now, this one airing, it was an experiment
and as such, by any measure

22
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:19,841
- a success.
- You keep using the word experiment

23
00:03:20,008 --> 00:03:21,526
like you're the goddamned
Wright Brothers.

24
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:24,054
When were you going to tell us
about this experiment?

25
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,722
Today. This morning.

26
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:29,517
I admit I got a little ahead of myself.
A little exuberant...

27
00:03:29,726 --> 00:03:31,352
...and for that, I apologize.

28
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,897
But the headline here is, I think...

29
00:03:34,064 --> 00:03:37,734
...we've gotten nearly 200 phone calls
since this one airing.

30
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:41,989
Cliff, since you and I spoke last night,
72 more.

31
00:03:42,156 --> 00:03:44,032
You hear that? Right there.

32
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:46,952
- That's the sound of victory.
- Jimmy, stop selling.

33
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:49,663
And don't act like
you don't see the problem here.

34
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,208
- I don't.
- You cut us out.

35
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:57,462
- You did an end run around us.
- Exuberance is no excuse.

36
00:03:58,296 --> 00:03:59,756
Cliff...

37
00:04:00,757 --> 00:04:03,551
Client outreach is my department.
Now you told me that from day one.

38
00:04:03,718 --> 00:04:05,261
jimmy, if I put you
in charge of payroll...

39
00:04:05,428 --> 00:04:08,098
would that mean i would be ok with you
giving everyone a million dollar bonus?

40
00:04:08,264 --> 00:04:10,767
You and I did discuss the possibility
of a commercial.

41
00:04:10,934 --> 00:04:12,853
The possibility in the abstract...

42
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,148
...for a grand total of 30 seconds
when I was halfway out the door.

43
00:04:16,314 --> 00:04:20,235
I guess... I thought I heard enthusiasm.
So I... I took some initiative.

44
00:04:20,443 --> 00:04:22,603
Some? Wow!

45
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,992
We are a team at Davis & Main.
This is a team approach.

46
00:04:27,242 --> 00:04:30,829
You coming to us as a solo practitioner,
I knew there's gonna be a learning curve.

47
00:04:30,996 --> 00:04:33,373
But if you simply can't fit in
as part of the team...

48
00:04:33,581 --> 00:04:35,625
I can fit in. I... I fit in.

49
00:04:35,792 --> 00:04:38,503
I am here to help you and HHM...

50
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:41,131
...win Sandpiper.
That's all this was about.

51
00:04:41,297 --> 00:04:43,800
Sandpiper's not what keeps the lights on
around here.

52
00:04:43,967 --> 00:04:47,679
We have clients who wouldn't want
to be associated with this kind of... This.

53
00:04:47,846 --> 00:04:50,015
Our image, our reputation...

54
00:04:50,182 --> 00:04:53,101
...is something we've been
carefully building for years.

55
00:04:53,268 --> 00:04:58,523
It's worth far more than any one case.
Something like this could damage it.

56
00:04:59,274 --> 00:05:02,610
Suffice to say, there's not a lot of love
for you in the room at the moment.

57
00:05:02,861 --> 00:05:06,447
The vote is currently 2 to 1
to fire you for cause.

58
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:10,618
However...

59
00:05:10,827 --> 00:05:12,704
...I believe in second chances.

60
00:05:12,871 --> 00:05:16,041
But know this is both strike one
and strike two.

61
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:19,711
Going forward, you can expect
a great deal more scrutiny.

62
00:05:31,806 --> 00:05:33,558
<i>..Yes, ma'am, let me take your number.</i>

63
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:46,696
Come on, come on.

64
00:05:49,032 --> 00:05:51,326
<i>Hello, you've reached
the voicemail of Kim Wexler.</i>

65
00:05:51,492 --> 00:05:54,829
<i>Please leave me a message
and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.</i>

66
00:05:55,122 --> 00:05:58,250
Hey, Kim, I need you to call me
as soon as you can, all right?

67
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:00,919
It's a time sensitive thing,
so ah ...

68
00:06:01,086 --> 00:06:04,965
<i>I mean, I may have ahh...</i>

69
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:10,762
<i>Just... Well, please call me
before you talk to Howard, okay? Bye.</i>

70
00:06:13,056 --> 00:06:14,349
It's a simple question, Kim.

71
00:06:14,515 --> 00:06:16,893
Did you or did you not know
about this commercial?

72
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,436
I... Yes.

73
00:06:18,603 --> 00:06:21,189
- He showed it to me...
- He showed it to you?

74
00:06:21,356 --> 00:06:25,277
- Yes. A few days ago.
- And you didn't say anything to anyone?

75
00:06:25,443 --> 00:06:26,987
No. I didn't.

76
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:31,074
- You didn't think I deserved a heads up?
- I didn't realize...

77
00:06:32,367 --> 00:06:34,535
At the time,
I didn't think it was necessary.

78
00:06:34,702 --> 00:06:36,079
You were wrong about that.

79
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,832
We were caught flat footed
in front of our co-counsel.

80
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:42,002
Which, I don't need to tell you,
does not reflect well on HHM.

81
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:43,337
Or on you.

82
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,803
That'll be all.

83
00:06:52,262 --> 00:06:53,847
You can go.

84
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:18,454
What are you going to do?

85
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,422
So, what do you think?

86
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:32,010
I figure from here,
you got a good bead on the place.

87
00:07:32,177 --> 00:07:34,762
But someone inside,
they can't pick you out.

88
00:07:34,929 --> 00:07:38,433
Tuco and me, that's our spot.
He always sits facing out.

89
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:41,936
Looks like a gangster thing, but
it's so he can keep an eye on his ride.

90
00:07:42,103 --> 00:07:44,981
Every Tuesday, we're here
squaring accounts...

91
00:07:45,148 --> 00:07:47,525
...dealer comes in, pays what he owes.

92
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,737
Tuco, he likes to get face to face.

93
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:53,073
Says everything he needs to know
is right here.

94
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,492
Looks them in the eyes. Just stares.
Like he's looking inside of them.

95
00:07:57,411 --> 00:08:00,663
I've seen him go like that five,
ten minutes.

96
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,584
And what does that accomplish?

97
00:08:05,501 --> 00:08:06,836
He calls it his lie detector.

98
00:08:07,003 --> 00:08:09,339
That's why these things go all day.

99
00:08:09,505 --> 00:08:11,841
Just the two of you? No extra muscle?

100
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:14,302
Don't need it.
We can handle our business.

101
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:18,681
Anyway, it takes hours.
Collect the cash. Count it. Lie detector.

102
00:08:18,848 --> 00:08:21,351
One at a time. Guy comes in,
transacts, then the next.

103
00:08:21,517 --> 00:08:24,645
Then, when we're done,
Tuco gets in his car...

104
00:08:24,812 --> 00:08:27,523
...I get in mine, boom,
we go our separate ways.

105
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:31,236
That is where you come in.

106
00:08:31,403 --> 00:08:34,072
See him packing up.
Drive over.

107
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:38,826
Pull up in the spot next to Tuco's.
Pop, headshot, roll out.

108
00:08:38,993 --> 00:08:40,245
Easy.

109
00:08:40,412 --> 00:08:43,539
I-40 on ramp is eight blocks up.

110
00:08:43,706 --> 00:08:47,543
You're in the wind before anyone
has time to blink. And here's the beauty.

111
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:50,297
All these dealers?
They know we're here.

112
00:08:50,464 --> 00:08:51,631
So the story is...

113
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:55,218
...one of them got ideas, decided
to kill Tuco, get a cut of the business.

114
00:08:55,385 --> 00:08:58,888
Could've been any of them
as far as the cartel's concerned.

115
00:08:59,347 --> 00:09:03,017
These Tuesdays of yours.
Day or night when you wrap it up?

116
00:09:03,226 --> 00:09:06,229
- Day.
- So full daylight, plenty of traffic.

117
00:09:06,396 --> 00:09:09,232
How exactly do I not get seen?
My car, at least.

118
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:11,901
Murphy's Law tells me
somebody's gonna pull the plate.

119
00:09:12,068 --> 00:09:14,112
Fine. Go to the yard, buy a beater.

120
00:09:14,362 --> 00:09:16,448
You gotta stay in the car.

121
00:09:16,614 --> 00:09:19,367
Ain't no one gonna see you.
And if they do see you, so what?

122
00:09:19,534 --> 00:09:22,996
That's why you're perfect.
You're no one, you got no connections.

123
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:24,622
You're a ghost.

124
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:28,835
So I pull in next to him.
That assumes there's a parking spot.

125
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:31,879
Our guys park next to him.
They come and go from the same spot.

126
00:09:32,046 --> 00:09:33,548
Last one takes off, you're open.

127
00:09:33,714 --> 00:09:36,050
Someone comes in behind me,
I'm blocked.

128
00:09:36,217 --> 00:09:40,138
- Who's gonna pull in behind you?
- I'm guessing someone who likes tacos.

129
00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:42,974
What then? What's my exit?

130
00:09:43,808 --> 00:09:47,061
I don't know. Get out and run.

131
00:09:47,228 --> 00:09:48,271
Bad knees.

132
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,691
Look. The details?
That's what I'm paying you for.

133
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:54,694
You got a better plan? Go on. Tell me.

134
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:56,237
I'm all ears.

135
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:00,325
You sure about this?

136
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:03,411
Killing your partner...

137
00:10:04,787 --> 00:10:07,457
...that's a bell you don't unring.

138
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:14,214
See this?

139
00:10:15,256 --> 00:10:17,425
You know how I got this?

140
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:20,178
Back in '96, '97,
Tuco and I were working...

141
00:10:20,345 --> 00:10:22,889
...with these bikers out
of Riverside County.

142
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:25,058
They were running
this peanut-butter crank.

143
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:29,145
Real shit, you know, but cheap.
We could sell it as fast as we got it.

144
00:10:29,312 --> 00:10:31,856
Anyway, Tuco develops a taste for it...

145
00:10:32,023 --> 00:10:35,985
...and crank does not bring out the best
in people, made Tuco erratic.

146
00:10:36,152 --> 00:10:39,780
Our connect was a guy
called Dog Paulson.

147
00:10:39,947 --> 00:10:44,035
One day, Tuco's settling up with Dog,
he decides to put on his lie detector.

148
00:10:44,202 --> 00:10:46,079
Dog is like, "What the hell," you know.

149
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:49,374
Tuco just keeps staring at him,
then he goes real quiet.

150
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,042
"You think I'm an idiot, Dog?"

151
00:10:51,209 --> 00:10:54,754
He thinks Dog is supplying his competitor,
trying to cut Tuco out.

152
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:57,131
Dog, he denies it.

153
00:10:58,508 --> 00:11:00,468
"No way, not me."

154
00:11:00,635 --> 00:11:04,805
Tuco doesn't even raise his voice,
but suddenly he's got a sawed-off...

155
00:11:04,972 --> 00:11:07,475
...and right in Dog's face.

156
00:11:07,642 --> 00:11:09,727
I was behind him.

157
00:11:11,145 --> 00:11:14,107
Sickest thing I ever saw to this day,
and this...

158
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:18,445
...a piece of Dog's skull under the skin,
a little piece of him.

159
00:11:18,612 --> 00:11:20,652
Tried digging it out,
but it's in there pretty good.

160
00:11:20,738 --> 00:11:22,907
Not the kind of thing
you go to the doctors for.

161
00:11:23,074 --> 00:11:28,079
The thing about it
was Tuco really liked Dog.

162
00:11:28,246 --> 00:11:29,581
Kind of felt bad afterwards.

163
00:11:29,747 --> 00:11:31,874
But when he's using..

164
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,877
Loco, Crazy.
There's no other way to put it.

165
00:11:35,044 --> 00:11:38,839
And he's using again, crystal,
much bigger kick.

166
00:11:39,674 --> 00:11:45,346
So it's like you said, if Tuco finds out
about my, you know, independent ventures...

167
00:11:45,513 --> 00:11:48,391
...it's gonna be Dog all over again.

168
00:11:48,933 --> 00:11:50,810
It's him or me.

169
00:12:04,865 --> 00:12:06,242
There.

170
00:12:08,202 --> 00:12:11,706
Man with a scoped rifle
could get a clean shot.

171
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:16,127
Fire a single round, disappear before
anybody knew what had happened.

172
00:12:16,294 --> 00:12:19,005
No witnesses, clean egress.

173
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:21,215
Pretty far.

174
00:12:22,758 --> 00:12:24,802
You can make that shot?

175
00:12:25,803 --> 00:12:27,430
Yeah.

176
00:12:29,474 --> 00:12:31,559
You saying you'd do it?

177
00:12:34,312 --> 00:12:36,105
Fifty grand.

178
00:12:36,731 --> 00:12:38,441
Fifty grand.

179
00:12:41,611 --> 00:12:43,821
I'll look into it.

180
00:13:10,515 --> 00:13:12,892
- Hey...
- Your brother isn't here, Mr. McGill.

181
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:17,021
I know. He sent me to get his ink blotter.
I'll just be a second.

182
00:13:17,188 --> 00:13:21,651
- Watch yourself, the floor is slick.
- Thank you, Gesualdo.

183
00:13:21,817 --> 00:13:24,320
Sorry about the floor.

184
00:13:31,202 --> 00:13:33,037
Oh, no.

185
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,831
Are you looking for Miss Wexler?

186
00:13:35,998 --> 00:13:38,501
- Guess I'm too late, huh?
- No, she's still here.

187
00:13:38,834 --> 00:13:40,670
Where?

188
00:13:55,976 --> 00:13:57,437
Kim.

189
00:14:00,481 --> 00:14:04,026
I am so, so sorry.

190
00:14:05,986 --> 00:14:09,616
- I should've told you last night.
- You think?

191
00:14:09,783 --> 00:14:11,659
I honestly thought I could fix it.

192
00:14:11,826 --> 00:14:15,162
I thought they'd understand
once they saw the numbers.

193
00:14:15,329 --> 00:14:19,125
I knew it would work, and it did.
It worked.

194
00:14:20,668 --> 00:14:25,131
Howard can't just stick you in Doc Review
because of something I did.

195
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:29,051
Plus, at an entirely different law firm.
What the hell kind of sense does that make?

196
00:14:29,218 --> 00:14:31,137
I told you this would happen.

197
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:34,641
- He can't blame you for this.
- I warned you he would.

198
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:38,185
I'm talking to Howard.

199
00:14:38,352 --> 00:14:41,731
What, call him a pig fucker again?
Yeah, that will help.

200
00:14:44,609 --> 00:14:47,737
I screwed up, you know. I know that.

201
00:14:47,903 --> 00:14:53,075
But this, this is total BS.
I'm talking to him tonight.

202
00:14:53,242 --> 00:14:56,329
- Jimmy, no. It'll only make things worse.
- I'll explain it to him.

203
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:57,997
No.

204
00:14:58,832 --> 00:15:01,793
I'm not asking you, I'm telling you.

205
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:04,879
If you go to Howard,
you and I, we're done.

206
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:11,093
So we're not done now?

207
00:15:12,762 --> 00:15:15,306
I need this job.

208
00:15:16,891 --> 00:15:20,520
And there's a weekly billing quota
that I'm about 40 hours behind on...

209
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:23,397
...so could you please just go?

210
00:15:29,403 --> 00:15:31,113
I'm sorry.

211
00:16:19,161 --> 00:16:20,663
Chuck.

212
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,583
Chuck!

213
00:16:25,668 --> 00:16:27,420
Come on!

214
00:16:28,546 --> 00:16:30,882
I'm not going away.

215
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:35,094
All right, you asked for it.

216
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:42,810
I'm coming in.

217
00:16:54,864 --> 00:16:56,156
Chuck?

218
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,791
Chuck.

219
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:12,214
Can you hear me?
Can you talk to me?

220
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:18,596
- You want me to get you to the hospital?
- No. No hospitals.

221
00:17:18,763 --> 00:17:20,932
I'll be all right.

222
00:17:21,933 --> 00:17:24,393
Get some water, please.

223
00:17:47,249 --> 00:17:49,669
Extra protection here.

224
00:18:03,891 --> 00:18:06,769
Here. You know what? Sit up.

225
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,439
- Can you sit...?
- All right.

226
00:18:12,399 --> 00:18:14,777
Okay, all right. Here.

227
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:05,828
That's the Armalite AR-50.

228
00:19:06,537 --> 00:19:09,957
State of the art,
accurate to 2400 meters.

229
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,752
I got the Leupold Mark 4 on it now...

230
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:15,713
...but I can always upgrade it
to a Schmidt & Bender.

231
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:20,885
Single-shot, bolt.
Simple, effective, reliable.

232
00:19:21,052 --> 00:19:25,222
It fires a .50 caliber BMG.
Very effective against soft targets...

233
00:19:25,389 --> 00:19:29,643
...in light cover, behind cars,
small-diameter trees and such.

234
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:34,189
As always, I've gone to the trouble
of grinding down the serial number.

235
00:19:34,398 --> 00:19:37,944
No, unless you ground the hole
clean through, acid will recover it.

236
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:41,072
Well, that would be true,
but I follow up with a pass...

237
00:19:41,238 --> 00:19:43,449
...through a random
stipple machine press.

238
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:46,201
Hides the patterns and metal density.

239
00:19:46,368 --> 00:19:50,497
Should throw off your X-ray diffraction
and some other higher-end methods.

240
00:19:50,664 --> 00:19:53,459
Nothing's perfect, of course,
but this is close.

241
00:19:55,711 --> 00:19:58,380
Looks like a hernia with a scope on it.

242
00:19:58,547 --> 00:20:03,719
Thirty-four pounds, not including
your bipod, which adds some heft.

243
00:20:06,055 --> 00:20:07,389
Too much gun.

244
00:20:07,556 --> 00:20:10,643
For most applications,
I would tend to agree.

245
00:20:11,769 --> 00:20:13,562
SR-25 Match rifle.

246
00:20:13,729 --> 00:20:18,109
Eugene Stoner-designed semi-auto.
That's about 11 pounds there.

247
00:20:18,275 --> 00:20:21,154
Not quite the range or the punch
of the AR-50...

248
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,449
...but you're talking about a .5 MOA
at well past a thousand meters.

249
00:20:25,616 --> 00:20:29,203
- I've heard they're prone to jam.
- It's been known to happen in the field...

250
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:33,415
...but there's not a semi-auto built
can boast it never jams.

251
00:20:33,582 --> 00:20:36,961
If that's a concern,
you ought to stick to bolts.

252
00:20:37,128 --> 00:20:41,465
Good bolt-action rifle, if you jammed it,
I'd wager you were setting out to do so.

253
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:46,179
Which brings us to the M40.

254
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:48,973
Tried and true, battle-tested.

255
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:54,561
Essentially the same rifle used
by Marine snipers since 1966.

256
00:20:54,979 --> 00:21:00,234
It's light, accurate, good for soft
targets in the 8 to 1200 meter range.

257
00:21:04,071 --> 00:21:05,948
You seem to know this one.

258
00:21:06,115 --> 00:21:08,283
Oh, yeah.

259
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:10,577
You could say that.

260
00:21:11,078 --> 00:21:16,500
That's the A1 model. There's not much
change from the original.

261
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:20,587
Biggest difference is the stock.
It's fiberglass instead of wood.

262
00:21:20,754 --> 00:21:24,633
- They changed it over in 1970 or so.
- Good.

263
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,136
Wood warped like hell.

264
00:21:27,302 --> 00:21:30,223
You get it wet,
put it in the sun, gone.

265
00:21:32,183 --> 00:21:34,185
Somebody probably should have
figured that out...

266
00:21:34,351 --> 00:21:36,979
...before they sent it into
a damn jungle.

267
00:21:37,146 --> 00:21:40,315
Yeah. Probably.

268
00:21:47,656 --> 00:21:51,285
If these aren't to your liking,
I could get my hands on a few more.

269
00:21:52,078 --> 00:21:54,788
No. I've changed my mind.

270
00:21:55,372 --> 00:21:57,083
Thank you.

271
00:21:57,332 --> 00:22:00,002
I don't need anything
at this time.

272
00:22:00,711 --> 00:22:03,089
- For your trouble.
- No, it's no trouble.

273
00:22:03,256 --> 00:22:05,549
I make my living
on repeat business.

274
00:22:05,716 --> 00:22:08,552
When you need what I'm offering,
you know how to find me.

275
00:22:44,546 --> 00:22:46,673
You're still here.

276
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:49,135
Yeah, I'm still here.

277
00:23:06,193 --> 00:23:07,736
Did you get any sleep?

278
00:23:08,321 --> 00:23:09,863
Some.

279
00:23:10,614 --> 00:23:12,158
Enough.

280
00:23:12,741 --> 00:23:14,285
How you feeling?

281
00:23:16,203 --> 00:23:17,955
I could use some tea.

282
00:23:23,543 --> 00:23:25,171
Thanks.

283
00:23:41,812 --> 00:23:44,106
- You scared me last night.
- Yeah.

284
00:23:44,273 --> 00:23:46,025
Happens sometimes.

285
00:23:46,733 --> 00:23:50,363
Sometimes I overdo it, that's all.
It passes.

286
00:23:52,406 --> 00:23:55,326
Going into the office really takes it
out of you, doesn't it?

287
00:23:55,492 --> 00:23:57,870
If I stay too long, yeah.

288
00:23:58,329 --> 00:24:00,039
Guess it's hard not to stay.

289
00:24:00,206 --> 00:24:02,791
There's so many important things
for you to do there...

290
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:05,961
...like, you know,
stick it to Kim Wexler.

291
00:24:06,586 --> 00:24:08,755
What did I do to Kim Wexler?

292
00:24:08,922 --> 00:24:10,966
She's back in the cornfield,
isn't she?

293
00:24:11,133 --> 00:24:13,093
I didn't do anything to Kim.

294
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:17,014
I mean, I was present, yes...

295
00:24:17,181 --> 00:24:20,184
...but management of personnel,
those decisions are all Howard's.

296
00:24:20,642 --> 00:24:24,771
That is rich. Now, tell me, when Howard
was making his management decisions...

297
00:24:24,938 --> 00:24:27,983
...was he sitting on your knee,
with your arm up his ass?

298
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:30,610
Hey, can he talk
while you drink a glass of water?

299
00:24:30,777 --> 00:24:33,822
That's uncalled for.
And if Howard were my puppet...

300
00:24:33,989 --> 00:24:36,950
...he certainly wouldn't have
recommended you to Davis & Main.

301
00:24:37,117 --> 00:24:41,414
Actually, I'm sure it was Kim Wexler
who talked him into doing that.

302
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,333
- Hence his anger.
- Don't punish Kim.

303
00:24:44,499 --> 00:24:48,379
If you're mad at me,
take it out on me.

304
00:24:50,756 --> 00:24:53,384
I know you like to think the world
revolves around you Jimmy,

305
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,928
but this has nothing
to do with you.

306
00:24:56,429 --> 00:24:59,473
Kim had a responsibility
to Hamlin Hamlin McGill.

307
00:24:59,681 --> 00:25:01,962
She should have been looking out
for her firm's interests.

308
00:25:02,017 --> 00:25:04,519
Not letting us know what you were up to
was her mistake.

309
00:25:04,686 --> 00:25:07,356
Oh, come on. You can't be
pissed off at her about this.

310
00:25:07,522 --> 00:25:10,150
I'm not. Howard is.

311
00:25:10,317 --> 00:25:13,612
- And why shouldn't he be?
- Because she didn't know.

312
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:17,366
She didn't know I was gonna
air the commercial.

313
00:25:17,532 --> 00:25:19,910
She didn't know I hadn't gotten
it approved. She just

314
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:21,870
She didn't know.

315
00:25:24,873 --> 00:25:27,000
- I see.
- She didn't know there was anything...

316
00:25:27,209 --> 00:25:29,378
...she was supposed to tell Howard.

317
00:25:29,544 --> 00:25:33,632
As far as she was concerned,
Cliff Main was already looped in.

318
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:36,260
You told her he was?

319
00:25:36,427 --> 00:25:39,596
I implied it. So it's on me.

320
00:25:39,763 --> 00:25:41,432
Not her.

321
00:25:45,352 --> 00:25:48,063
She didn't say anything to us
about that.

322
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:52,276
She wouldn't. No,
she wouldn't want to make me look bad.

323
00:25:52,443 --> 00:25:55,446
You have to admit this shows
a lack of judgment on her part.

324
00:25:55,612 --> 00:25:57,739
She knows you.
She should have known better.

325
00:25:57,906 --> 00:26:00,409
- You are such an asshole.
- Why?

326
00:26:00,575 --> 00:26:03,162
For pointing out her one mistake
was believing in you?

327
00:26:03,329 --> 00:26:06,165
Chrissake, can we get
some perspective here?

328
00:26:06,332 --> 00:26:09,626
It was a simple little commercial.
It aired once, that's all.

329
00:26:09,793 --> 00:26:12,921
Can I remind you, it worked?
It worked like a dream.

330
00:26:13,088 --> 00:26:17,176
See, that's your problem, Jimmy.
Thinking the ends justify the means.

331
00:26:17,343 --> 00:26:20,053
And you're forever shocked
when it blows up in your face.

332
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,097
What did I do
that was so wrong?

333
00:26:22,597 --> 00:26:24,641
You broke the rules.

334
00:26:24,808 --> 00:26:26,935
You turned Kim
into your accessory.

335
00:26:27,102 --> 00:26:29,563
You embarrassed Howard, who...
God help him.

336
00:26:29,729 --> 00:26:32,107
...inexplicably vouched for you
with Cliff Main.

337
00:26:32,274 --> 00:26:35,694
You made Cliff and his partners
look like schmucks. Shall I go on?

338
00:26:35,902 --> 00:26:40,115
How he hasn't fired you for this
positively mystifies me.

339
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:42,368
Perspective.

340
00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:45,704
You want perspective?
I'll give you mine.

341
00:26:45,871 --> 00:26:48,957
You're my brother,
and I love you...

342
00:26:49,124 --> 00:26:53,212
...but you're like an alcoholic who
refuses to admit he's got a problem.

343
00:26:53,379 --> 00:26:55,464
Now someone's given you the keys
to the school bus...

344
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:57,924
...and I'm not gonna let you
drive it off a cliff.

345
00:26:58,592 --> 00:27:00,553
Can we just get down
to brass tacks here?

346
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:04,014
What can I do to put Kim back
where she belongs huh?

347
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:06,892
You want me to quit Davis & Main?
That's fine!

348
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:09,019
I never wanted that job
in the first place.

349
00:27:09,186 --> 00:27:12,772
I can't get through to you. Life is not
one big game of <i>Let's Make A Deal.</i>

350
00:27:12,939 --> 00:27:16,402
Yes, it is. I'm Monty Hall.
What's behind door number two?

351
00:27:16,569 --> 00:27:18,571
What'll it take, huh?

352
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:20,614
You want me to quit
being a lawyer?

353
00:27:21,698 --> 00:27:25,627
Just, a chimp with a machine gun,
that's me, right, Huh?

354
00:27:25,994 --> 00:27:29,415
So What do you say?
You help Kim, I quit the law.

355
00:27:29,582 --> 00:27:31,917
- Is that a deal?
- I didn't say that.

356
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:34,669
You didn't say it,
but that's what you want, right?

357
00:27:34,836 --> 00:27:37,964
That's why you put the screws to Kim
in the 1st place, to squeeze me!

358
00:27:38,131 --> 00:27:40,759
I didn't say that
and I would never say that.

359
00:27:40,926 --> 00:27:43,720
- Why not?
- Because if I were impeding the career of

360
00:27:43,887 --> 00:27:48,225
one of my employees, for the purpose of compelling
you to do something against your will...

361
00:27:48,392 --> 00:27:51,853
- ...that would be extortion.
- Yeah. It would.

362
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:55,190
So? You gonna extort me, Chuck?

363
00:27:55,399 --> 00:27:58,818
It's a lead pipe cinch you get away
with it. I'm not gonna tell anyone.

364
00:27:58,985 --> 00:28:01,405
It's real easy.
You just set things right for Kim.

365
00:28:01,572 --> 00:28:04,450
You get her back in her office, out of
Doc Review, everything back to normal...

366
00:28:04,617 --> 00:28:07,744
...and I quit the law for good.

367
00:28:07,911 --> 00:28:10,240
No more Jimmy McGill, Esquire.
Poof!

368
00:28:10,372 --> 00:28:12,541
Like he never even existed.

369
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:15,557
Wow.. Wow!

370
00:28:15,628 --> 00:28:18,088
But I need to hear the words
come out of your mouth, okay?

371
00:28:18,255 --> 00:28:20,715
You're a man of your word.
You're an upstanding man, right?

372
00:28:20,882 --> 00:28:23,885
- God's sake, Jimmy.
- Come on, Chuck! Extort me!

373
00:28:24,052 --> 00:28:28,807
Say "quit" and I will quit, but I need
to hear it from your mouth.

374
00:28:29,015 --> 00:28:31,101
You want me to commit a felony.

375
00:28:31,268 --> 00:28:33,770
Because that's
what you'd do, right?

376
00:28:33,937 --> 00:28:36,523
You wanna believe that deep down,
I'm some hypocrite.

377
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:39,276
Let's find out.
Come on down, Chuck...

378
00:28:39,443 --> 00:28:43,614
...roll around in the dirt with me.
All your dreams will come true.

379
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:46,825
Go on, do it! Go on!

380
00:28:49,703 --> 00:28:51,955
I am not the bad guy here.

381
00:28:52,623 --> 00:28:56,585
You don't wanna be a lawyer, that's
between you and the New Mexico State Bar.

382
00:28:56,751 --> 00:28:58,629
You wanna quit Davis & Main,
be my guest.

383
00:28:59,087 --> 00:29:01,381
You clearly don't need help
from me to tank your career.

384
00:29:01,548 --> 00:29:03,676
You're doing just fine
on your own.

385
00:29:05,302 --> 00:29:09,181
Speaking of which,
it's an hour's drive to Santa Fe.

386
00:29:09,348 --> 00:29:11,016
Even if you leave right now...

387
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:13,893
...you're still gonna be
at least 20 minutes late for work.

388
00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:17,105
Another feather in your cap
with Clifford Main.

389
00:29:40,671 --> 00:29:42,005
So?

390
00:29:44,466 --> 00:29:46,385
I'm not gonna do it.

391
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:48,470
What are you negotiating now?

392
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:51,139
No amount of money
makes this a good idea.

393
00:29:51,306 --> 00:29:53,350
- For you.
- Look, man.

394
00:29:53,517 --> 00:29:55,602
- I told you that I'm not...
- It's a bad move.

395
00:29:55,769 --> 00:29:59,481
- It doesn't solve your real problem.
- My real problem. What's that?

396
00:30:00,148 --> 00:30:03,109
It's not Tuco.
It's keeping it secret.

397
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:07,740
A dead Tuco draws
Salamancas like flies.

398
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:10,825
Cartel noses into the business.

399
00:30:11,034 --> 00:30:12,536
Looks for who hit one of theirs.

400
00:30:12,703 --> 00:30:15,080
You gonna be able to
keep your secrets then?

401
00:30:16,248 --> 00:30:18,208
Something's gotta give.

402
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:21,712
With you, without you, I don't care.

403
00:30:21,878 --> 00:30:23,922
But something's gonna happen.

404
00:30:24,715 --> 00:30:26,508
Well, you said it yourself.

405
00:30:26,675 --> 00:30:29,344
You don't need him dead.
You need him to go away.

406
00:30:29,511 --> 00:30:31,471
You mean snitch?

407
00:30:31,638 --> 00:30:35,392
Man, I drop a dime on Tuco,
who do you think the cartel looks at? Me.

408
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:39,062
I call the cops, I get picked up too.
I'm what you call a "known associate."

409
00:30:39,229 --> 00:30:40,564
So I'm locked up with Tuco...

410
00:30:40,731 --> 00:30:43,066
...who's looking for the guy
that put him there.

411
00:30:43,734 --> 00:30:47,070
- Tell me how that helps me.
- You won't have to talk to the cops.

412
00:30:47,237 --> 00:30:49,239
You won't have to do any time.

413
00:30:49,406 --> 00:30:52,826
There's no killing,
but your Tuco problem...

414
00:30:53,827 --> 00:30:55,954
...it goes away.

415
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,400
It's all there.

416
00:32:08,652 --> 00:32:10,987
Let the man count.

417
00:32:17,577 --> 00:32:19,078
We're good.

418
00:32:25,669 --> 00:32:27,379
So...

419
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:29,756
...until next time, huh?

420
00:32:43,186 --> 00:32:44,688
Tuco.

421
00:32:58,911 --> 00:33:00,495
Okay.

422
00:33:00,995 --> 00:33:02,121
Go.

423
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:03,665
Okay.

424
00:33:06,459 --> 00:33:08,169
I'll see you next week, Tuco.

425
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:12,173
- Nacho.
- Yeah, see you, Domingo.

426
00:33:15,719 --> 00:33:17,846
He's got good numbers.

427
00:33:18,137 --> 00:33:19,932
He's hustling.

428
00:33:20,306 --> 00:33:22,016
What do you think?

429
00:33:23,393 --> 00:33:24,937
Solid?

430
00:33:56,092 --> 00:33:59,012
Yes, I would like to
report a fight going on...

431
00:33:59,178 --> 00:34:03,308
...at the El Michoacano restaurant
on the 5000 block of Isleta Boulevard.

432
00:34:03,475 --> 00:34:06,937
There is a man
threatening another man with a gun.

433
00:34:07,103 --> 00:34:10,148
It looks to be some sort of gang thing.

434
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:12,275
Oh, sorry.

435
00:34:12,442 --> 00:34:14,444
I'm a passerby.

436
00:34:14,611 --> 00:34:16,947
I don't wanna get involved.

437
00:34:49,021 --> 00:34:51,064
What the fuck?

438
00:34:51,272 --> 00:34:52,899
Did you see that?

439
00:34:53,066 --> 00:34:55,527
- See what?
- That old man.

440
00:34:55,694 --> 00:34:57,737
He just hit my car.

441
00:35:13,545 --> 00:35:15,005
Hey.

442
00:35:17,799 --> 00:35:19,342
Hello.

443
00:35:21,302 --> 00:35:23,304
Well, let me see.

444
00:35:24,597 --> 00:35:27,600
Give me the number four,
the <i>pollo, por favor.</i>

445
00:35:27,767 --> 00:35:29,310
- That's to go.
- Yes, sir.

446
00:35:29,477 --> 00:35:30,979
Hey, you.

447
00:35:31,563 --> 00:35:33,189
Hey, gramps.

448
00:35:33,648 --> 00:35:35,734
You just hit my car.

449
00:35:36,109 --> 00:35:38,319
You talking to me?

450
00:35:38,778 --> 00:35:41,031
Check out Mr. Magoo here.

451
00:35:41,197 --> 00:35:42,240
Yes, sir.

452
00:35:42,407 --> 00:35:46,494
You see that car that you
parked your piece of shit next to?

453
00:35:46,661 --> 00:35:48,580
That's mine.

454
00:35:48,747 --> 00:35:50,164
You just ran into it.

455
00:35:50,373 --> 00:35:51,791
No, I don't think I did.

456
00:35:51,958 --> 00:35:53,126
You calling me a liar?

457
00:35:55,962 --> 00:35:57,005
No.

458
00:35:57,296 --> 00:35:58,715
Hey.

459
00:35:59,049 --> 00:36:02,010
I saw it too.
Gonna stand here and deny it?

460
00:36:02,969 --> 00:36:05,555
Oh, guys. I don't know what to tell you.

461
00:36:05,722 --> 00:36:10,268
I'm not aware of hitting anyone's car.
But if I did, I apologize.

462
00:36:10,435 --> 00:36:11,811
So...

463
00:36:12,562 --> 00:36:13,980
$6.33.

464
00:36:20,445 --> 00:36:21,613
You keep the change.

465
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,866
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.

466
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,042
Don't you walk away from me.

467
00:36:34,208 --> 00:36:36,252
Hey, pops.
You better listen to the man.

468
00:36:36,419 --> 00:36:37,670
Come on, guys.

469
00:36:37,837 --> 00:36:40,506
Let's just keep things friendly,
all right?

470
00:36:40,673 --> 00:36:42,175
I ain't your friend.

471
00:36:42,341 --> 00:36:45,011
Look. You see that? You.

472
00:36:45,219 --> 00:36:47,722
- You did that.
- Oh, come on. That'll buff right out.

473
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:53,311
You're gonna make this all right.

474
00:36:53,478 --> 00:36:55,480
You're not leaving until you do.

475
00:36:56,022 --> 00:36:58,984
- Fine. You got a pen?
- A pen?

476
00:36:59,192 --> 00:37:01,444
A pen. We'll exchange information.

477
00:37:01,611 --> 00:37:05,573
Insurance. I have very good coverage.
They'll take care of this.

478
00:37:06,866 --> 00:37:09,744
I'm not messing around
with insurance, <i>ese.</i>

479
00:37:09,911 --> 00:37:11,245
Cash.

480
00:37:11,412 --> 00:37:14,833
Listen, I'm willing to
accept responsibility.

481
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,002
But if you're not
going through insurance...

482
00:37:17,169 --> 00:37:20,338
...then I have maybe
20, 30 bucks on me, that's all.

483
00:37:20,505 --> 00:37:22,548
Okay, now you're lying to me.

484
00:37:22,715 --> 00:37:25,010
I saw your wallet.
You got plenty in there.

485
00:37:25,718 --> 00:37:27,428
Take it out.

486
00:37:27,595 --> 00:37:30,264
Let's look together. Jog your memory.

487
00:37:31,307 --> 00:37:33,977
You heard him. Take out the wallet.

488
00:37:34,602 --> 00:37:38,439
I just cashed my Social Security check.
It's all I have till the end of the month.

489
00:37:38,606 --> 00:37:40,316
And I am not giving it to you.

490
00:37:43,153 --> 00:37:44,403
You're not?

491
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:48,241
I offered to do this the right way. If you
can't accept that, then I can't help you.

492
00:37:49,075 --> 00:37:51,536
Oh, come on, guys.

493
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:55,456
I'm gonna make this
real simple for you.

494
00:37:55,623 --> 00:37:57,709
Give me your wallet.

495
00:37:57,876 --> 00:38:01,129
And maybe you walk away from this.

496
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:08,220
I'm not giving you a damn thing.

497
00:38:08,427 --> 00:38:09,846
No, homes?

498
00:38:10,429 --> 00:38:11,931
You give me your wallet.

499
00:38:12,098 --> 00:38:14,184
Let's just stay calm here.

500
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:17,562
You see me sweating, bitch? Wallet.

501
00:38:19,647 --> 00:38:21,357
Wallet.

502
00:38:26,029 --> 00:38:27,697
Wallet.

503
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:45,298
There's, like, 400 here.

504
00:38:45,924 --> 00:38:48,593
You got some crazy lip on you,
old man.

505
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,554
Your life worth 400 bucks?

506
00:38:51,721 --> 00:38:53,347
Tuco, time to bounce.

507
00:38:53,514 --> 00:38:55,767
Yeah, go, go.

508
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:09,530
You, one lucky old man.

509
00:39:10,364 --> 00:39:11,699
What the hell? Let go.

510
00:39:12,366 --> 00:39:14,160
Let go.

511
00:39:15,995 --> 00:39:17,830
Let... Let go.

512
00:39:19,124 --> 00:39:20,166
Let go.

513
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,002
Let go.

514
00:39:23,962 --> 00:39:25,588
Let go.

515
00:39:41,687 --> 00:39:43,397
- Let me see your hands.
- Hands.

516
00:39:43,606 --> 00:39:46,067
Hands up! Now!

517
00:39:48,527 --> 00:39:49,570
On the ground.

518
00:39:49,737 --> 00:39:51,281
That all you got?

519
00:39:51,614 --> 00:39:53,658
Get on the ground!

520
00:40:52,417 --> 00:40:53,383
Wow!

521
00:40:55,511 --> 00:40:57,013
Look at you.

522
00:40:58,973 --> 00:41:01,267
Are you gonna have to testify?

523
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:06,314
The cops witnessed him
in the commission of a felony.

524
00:41:06,731 --> 00:41:08,524
My wallet in his pocket.

525
00:41:08,691 --> 00:41:12,404
Had the gun.
He gets a five to ten stretch.

526
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,993
Twenty-five.

527
00:41:19,618 --> 00:41:21,537
You definitely earned it.

528
00:41:23,248 --> 00:41:27,835
Still, you could have gotten
twice as much for one-tenth the hassle.

529
00:41:28,002 --> 00:41:29,879
You would've
done the world a favor.

530
00:41:30,171 --> 00:41:32,200
You wouldn't look like someone
took a lead pipe to your face.

531
00:41:32,324 --> 00:41:34,842
Plus, when Tuco gets out...

532
00:41:35,009 --> 00:41:37,220
...maybe he comes looking for you.

533
00:41:37,387 --> 00:41:39,305
Get to the point.

534
00:41:39,472 --> 00:41:43,351
I'm just saying, you went a long way
to not pull that trigger.

535
00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:46,604
Why?
