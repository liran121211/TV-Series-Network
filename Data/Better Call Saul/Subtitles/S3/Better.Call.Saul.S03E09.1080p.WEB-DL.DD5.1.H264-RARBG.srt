00:08:26,383 --> 00:08:28,813
You're like every other
person in this building.

181
00:08:28,815 --> 00:08:30,539
Like you?

182
00:08:31,984 --> 00:08:34,188
You think I'm not on the books?

183
00:08:34,199 --> 00:08:37,020
I am. Under my own name.

184
00:08:37,031 --> 00:08:39,991
- This the way you handled it before?
- Handled what?

185
00:08:39,993 --> 00:08:43,127
The money. For Fring's other guys.

186
00:08:43,972 --> 00:08:45,639
Other guys?

187
00:08:46,586 --> 00:08:49,103
This is the first time I've done this...

188
00:08:49,114 --> 00:08:50,414
for anyone.

189
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,356
I don't know what you do, but...

190
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,375
Mr. Fring must think
you're quite good at it.

191
00:08:57,377 --> 00:08:59,367
[Sighs]

192
00:09:13,016 --> 00:09:14,692
20 weeks?

193
00:09:14,694 --> 00:09:16,627
The sooner you're off
my books, the better.

194
00:09:16,629 --> 00:09:18,211
- [Intercom beeps]
- Justin?

195
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:28,452
Can you make a copy of
these, please? Thank you.

196
00:09:30,725 --> 00:09:32,217
[Door closes]

197
00:09:33,723 --> 00:09:35,170
What?

198
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:39,749
This is a very nice office.

199
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,694
Thank you.

200
00:09:44,858 --> 00:09:48,200
Seem to be risking a
lot for a drug dealer.

201
00:09:48,211 --> 00:09:49,824
"Drug dealer"?

202
00:09:52,499 --> 00:09:53,865
[Scoffs]

203
00:09:53,867 --> 00:09:56,601
If that's all you think he is...

204
00:09:57,368 --> 00:09:59,941
then you don't know Gustavo Fring.

205
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,952
[Sighs]

206
00:10:15,889 --> 00:10:19,203
[Pen scratches]

207
00:10:19,214 --> 00:10:21,425
Howard: Let me understand you...

208
00:10:21,427 --> 00:10:23,516
you're proposing to double our premiums

209
00:10:23,527 --> 00:10:26,764
on every one of our
practicing attorneys?

210
00:10:27,407 --> 00:10:29,033
Man: We know this is abrupt...

211
00:10:29,035 --> 00:10:31,269
new issues have come to light.

212
00:10:31,271 --> 00:10:33,146
"New issues"?

213
00:10:33,157 --> 00:10:35,528
You mean Mr. McGill's
testimony at the Bar?

214
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:37,074
That's a part of it, yes.

215
00:10:37,076 --> 00:10:39,364
After 25 years of paying full premiums,

216
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,427
I can count on one hand
the number of our claims.

217
00:10:41,438 --> 00:10:43,442
Woman: This is an underwriting
decision... that's all.

218
00:10:43,453 --> 00:10:45,049
You shouldn't take it personally.

219
00:10:45,051 --> 00:10:46,751
Man: In some special circumstances,

220
00:10:46,753 --> 00:10:48,553
we have been known to extend a rider.

221
00:10:48,555 --> 00:10:49,787
What kind of rider?

222
00:10:49,789 --> 00:10:51,656
Woman: A senior,
management-level partner

223
00:10:51,658 --> 00:10:53,658
who would supervise Charles' work,

224
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:56,273
attend court and client
meetings with him,

225
00:10:56,284 --> 00:10:57,584
review filings.

226
00:10:57,595 --> 00:10:58,728
Man: The few times we've done this,

227
00:10:58,739 --> 00:11:00,384
it's been for clients
with a high probability

228
00:11:00,395 --> 00:11:02,650
of catastrophic health
failure as a precaution.

229
00:11:02,661 --> 00:11:05,244
What you're saying is that
for any case Charles takes on,

230
00:11:05,255 --> 00:11:07,439
another partner would
be tied up, as well,

231
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:08,850
and we don't bill a penny more?

232
00:11:08,861 --> 00:11:10,632
This is ludicrous.

233
00:11:10,643 --> 00:11:13,272
The insurance industry
is heavily regulated.

234
00:11:13,283 --> 00:11:14,830
I can think of a dozen infractions

235
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:17,173
- right here off the top of my head.
- Mr. McGill...

236
00:11:17,182 --> 00:11:19,783
You're hoping we'll
either find another carrier

237
00:11:19,785 --> 00:11:21,616
or cut you an enormous check.

238
00:11:21,627 --> 00:11:22,827
Win-win for you!

239
00:11:22,838 --> 00:11:25,021
I assure you, neither
is going to happen.

240
00:11:25,023 --> 00:11:26,851
What will happen is very simple...

241
00:11:26,862 --> 00:11:28,413
you're going to do right by us

242
00:11:28,424 --> 00:11:30,159
or we will compel you to do so.

243
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:32,762
- What do you mean by "compel"?
- You know exactly what I mean.

244
00:11:32,764 --> 00:11:35,632
If you're threatening litigation,
I'm afraid this meeting is over.

245
00:11:35,643 --> 00:11:37,253
Then it's over.

246
00:11:37,932 --> 00:11:39,580
Thank you for your time.

247
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,151
Mr. Hamlin, Mr. McGill.

248
00:11:44,442 --> 00:11:46,206
[Door creaks]

249
00:11:52,284 --> 00:11:54,273
All right. Where do we begin?

250
00:11:54,284 --> 00:11:56,820
Francis should start
digging into regulations.

251
00:11:56,822 --> 00:11:59,456
I'm sorry I don't have the code sections

252
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:00,890
at my fingertips just now.

253
00:12:00,892 --> 00:12:02,692
Let's pull a team of associates

254
00:12:02,694 --> 00:12:05,892
and get them looking at every
angle of injunctive relief.

255
00:12:05,903 --> 00:12:07,247
- Before close of business...
- [Glass thumps lightly]

256
00:12:07,258 --> 00:12:09,632
... we're going to hit Santa
Rosa with a demand letter

257
00:12:09,634 --> 00:12:11,401
that'll make their heads spin.

258
00:12:11,403 --> 00:12:13,470
[Chuckles] Odds are, inside a week,

259
00:12:13,472 --> 00:12:15,333
they'll be sitting at the table again.

260
00:12:15,344 --> 00:12:17,239
- [Liquid pouring]
- And if not...

261
00:12:17,242 --> 00:12:20,008
well, we've never
shied away from a fight.

262
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:21,452
[Decanter thumps lightly]

263
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:25,827
Chuck, do you remember Al McConnell?

264
00:12:25,838 --> 00:12:27,717
Of course. Helluva litigator.

265
00:12:27,719 --> 00:12:29,182
Retired now, isn't he?

266
00:12:29,193 --> 00:12:31,491
He's a professor at UNM now.

267
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:34,491
Wrote a fantastic book on
SCOTUS during Reconstruction.

268
00:12:34,493 --> 00:12:35,725
Fascinating stuff.

269
00:12:35,727 --> 00:12:36,877
Okay...

270
00:12:36,888 --> 00:12:39,585
I was talking to him, and he mentioned

271
00:12:39,596 --> 00:12:42,538
he'd love you to come
speak to his One-Ls.

272
00:12:42,549 --> 00:12:45,619
Maybe make it a regular
thing, if you wanted.

273
00:12:45,748 --> 00:12:47,081
[Scoffs]

274
00:12:47,092 --> 00:12:48,872
What are you talking about, Howard?

275
00:12:48,874 --> 00:12:51,046
What I'm saying is...

276
00:12:51,057 --> 00:12:53,910
maybe it's time to hang up your spurs.

277
00:12:54,432 --> 00:12:56,303
Become partner emeritus...

278
00:12:56,314 --> 00:12:58,882
leave your name on the firm
but focus on your legacy.

279
00:12:58,884 --> 00:13:02,319
You always said you wanted to
work on the Commerce Clause...

280
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,030
you can write the book on it.

281
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:06,875
And no longer be a practicing lawyer.

282
00:13:08,642 --> 00:13:11,296
Chuck, there's more to life than this.

283
00:13:11,307 --> 00:13:14,130
That day is far in the future, Howard.

284
00:13:14,132 --> 00:13:16,932
And I don't appreciate the suggestion.

285
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:20,603
What if it's not a suggestion?

286
00:13:20,605 --> 00:13:21,783
Meaning? [Glass thumps]

287
00:13:21,794 --> 00:13:24,707
Meaning, if enough people
tell you that you're drunk,

288
00:13:24,709 --> 00:13:26,976
maybe it's time to sit down.

289
00:13:29,613 --> 00:13:32,992
You want me to retire
over this... insurance?!

290
00:13:33,003 --> 00:13:34,433
It's not just the insurance.

291
00:13:34,444 --> 00:13:37,278
That's the straw that
broke the camel's back.

292
00:13:38,636 --> 00:13:41,324
So this is about my condition.

293
00:13:41,606 --> 00:13:42,988
Look!

294
00:13:43,661 --> 00:13:44,988
Look!

295
00:13:47,381 --> 00:13:49,026
You see?

296
00:13:50,027 --> 00:13:51,935
[Chuckling] See?

297
00:13:51,937 --> 00:13:53,503
I'm better!

298
00:13:53,941 --> 00:13:56,308
[Chuckling] Howard, I'm fine!

299
00:14:00,066 --> 00:14:02,571
This is not what "fine" looks like.

300
00:14:02,582 --> 00:14:04,230
[Sighs]

301
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:06,443
[Lamp thuds]

302
00:14:06,454 --> 00:14:08,985
Chuck, you are the best
legal mind I've ever known.

303
00:14:08,987 --> 00:14:10,587
Hands down.

304
00:14:11,207 --> 00:14:13,669
But your decision-making has become...

305
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,300
unpredictable.

306
00:14:16,194 --> 00:14:19,699
And I can't be partners with
someone whose judgment I don't trust.

307
00:14:24,499 --> 00:14:25,918
Chuck...

308
00:14:28,197 --> 00:14:32,279
[Indistinct conversations]

309
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:33,949
[Door closes]

310
00:14:38,555 --> 00:14:42,333
This right here is the
Texas-New Mexico border.

311
00:14:42,343 --> 00:14:43,473
[Grunts]

312
00:14:43,485 --> 00:14:47,521
Now, all of my wells are square...

313
00:14:47,532 --> 00:14:49,528
on the Texas side.

314
00:14:49,538 --> 00:14:52,746
When I negotiated for the
mineral and property rights,

315
00:14:52,757 --> 00:14:56,965
the surveyors said that the
next nearest pool extended to...

316
00:15:01,014 --> 00:15:02,632
about here.

317
00:15:02,643 --> 00:15:04,089
Right.

318
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,311
But... after some extraction,

319
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:09,172
the west wall of the salt dome gave way,

320
00:15:09,183 --> 00:15:11,590
opening up another pool
that extends... what...

321
00:15:11,601 --> 00:15:13,249
100 yards over the border?

322
00:15:13,251 --> 00:15:14,773
That's about the size of it, yeah.

323
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:17,559
And now you have New Mexico
rights holders to deal with.

324
00:15:18,062 --> 00:15:19,968
You know, they should get
profit on what's theirs,

325
00:15:19,979 --> 00:15:21,968
but now I've got two
states coming after me

326
00:15:21,978 --> 00:15:24,178
for taxes on each and every gallon.

327
00:15:25,552 --> 00:15:27,530
No equipment crosses the border?

328
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:29,140
No, ma'am.

329
00:15:29,158 --> 00:15:31,616
Nothing below the surface, like the...

330
00:15:32,702 --> 00:15:34,459
What... is it a drill bit?

331
00:15:34,461 --> 00:15:37,202
It would be the sucker rod at
this point, but no, none of that.

332
00:15:37,213 --> 00:15:38,997
Only on the Texas side.

333
00:15:38,999 --> 00:15:42,500
But that's not stopping New
Mexico from trying to bleed me.

334
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,101
You said on the phone
you have a solution.

335
00:15:46,406 --> 00:15:48,804
You don't negotiate a lease
with the rights holders.

336
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:51,384
- You offer to pay them damages.
- Damages?

337
00:15:51,395 --> 00:15:53,525
For diminishing their resource.

338
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:57,135
A significant fraction of the
value of the New Mexico portion,

339
00:15:57,146 --> 00:15:59,353
but without paying for
the rights themselves.

340
00:15:59,753 --> 00:16:01,744
So a kind of a payoff.

341
00:16:02,954 --> 00:16:04,900
Then you don't get hit with the taxes.

342
00:16:04,911 --> 00:16:07,044
You think you can make that fly?

343
00:16:07,055 --> 00:16:09,556
If someone came to me with this offer...

344
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:11,429
I'd sure as hell take it.

345
00:16:11,431 --> 00:16:13,898
[Chuckling] Wish I'd called you sooner.

346
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:16,205
Way they're makin' noise,

347
00:16:16,216 --> 00:16:18,853
if I don't get this thing wrapped
up by the end of the quarter,

348
00:16:18,864 --> 00:16:22,146
I'm pretty sure the tax
boys are gonna take me apart.

349
00:16:22,157 --> 00:16:24,658
And that's two weeks from now?

350
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:28,613
I can do it by then.

351
00:16:28,615 --> 00:16:30,181
Really?

352
00:16:30,183 --> 00:16:32,071
If we can get all the
rights holders in one place,

353
00:16:32,082 --> 00:16:34,616
I can walk them through
what we're proposing.

354
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:36,788
If they're smart, they'll go for it.

355
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,289
Well, hot damn.

356

00:45:22,129 --> 00:45:24,597
I know... you do. Uh, I
am happy for you, Jimmy.

904
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:25,931
Be happy for us!

905
00:45:25,933 --> 00:45:28,245
This is the solution to everything.

906
00:45:28,256 --> 00:45:29,780
Okay, Francesca, could you
just put these all in my car?

907
00:45:29,791 --> 00:45:31,319
Kim.

908
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:32,589
Yeah. Jimmy, I gotta go.

909
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,495
Gimme five goddamn minutes.

910
00:45:34,506 --> 00:45:36,256
- I don't have five minutes.
- But you're already late.

911
00:45:36,267 --> 00:45:39,011
What's five more minutes?
So drive 60 instead of 55.

912
00:45:39,013 --> 00:45:40,624
- [Chuckling] Jimmy!
- What?

913
00:45:40,635 --> 00:45:42,134
- [Door opens]
- You're not hearing me.

914
00:45:42,145 --> 00:45:43,983
Our troubles are over! Come on!

915
00:45:43,985 --> 00:45:45,706
Jimmy, I'm leaving now.

916
00:45:45,717 --> 00:45:46,986
I'll be back in a few hours.

917
00:45:46,997 --> 00:45:48,186
Think of all the things
you want to say to me,

918
00:45:48,197 --> 00:45:49,813
and just say them to me later, okay?

919
00:45:49,824 --> 00:45:51,202
Bye.

920
00:45:51,213 --> 00:45:52,574
[Door closes]

921
00:45:57,831 --> 00:45:59,378
[Door opens]

922
00:46:01,433 --> 00:46:02,738
[Door closes]

923
00:46:02,749 --> 00:46:04,853
You. Shots.

924
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:07,271
- Uh, I...
- Shots.

925
00:46:07,282 --> 00:46:09,148
We're celebrating.

926
00:46:15,122 --> 00:46:17,316
- Cheers.
- [Glasses clink]

927
00:46:18,685 --> 00:46:20,572
[Slurps]

928
00:46:20,583 --> 00:46:21,864
Smooth.

929
00:46:21,875 --> 00:46:23,522
[Exhales sharply]

930
00:46:23,524 --> 00:46:25,057
[Tapping counter]

931
00:46:25,059 --> 00:46:26,474
Yeah.

932
00:46:31,028 --> 00:46:35,000
Under the terms we're offering,
you get a substantial payment

933
00:46:35,002 --> 00:46:38,291
without any impact to your property
via drilling and extraction.

934
00:46:38,302 --> 00:46:39,672
And rather than waiting years to close,

935
00:46:39,674 --> 00:46:43,353
Mr. Gatwood is offering cash
on the barrel, right now.

936
00:46:43,364 --> 00:46:46,455
Given the cost of overhead, liabilities,

937
00:46:46,466 --> 00:46:48,747
and other burdens Mr. Gatwood assumes,

938
00:46:48,749 --> 00:46:51,310
we believe this offer is more than fair.

939
00:46:51,321 --> 00:46:52,917
We believe...

940
00:46:53,404 --> 00:46:56,919
we believe this offer is more than fair.

941
00:47:10,204 --> 00:47:11,858
[Gasps]

942
00:47:11,869 --> 00:47:15,397
[Air rushing]

943
00:47:16,014 --> 00:47:19,405
[Breathing heavily]

944
00:47:25,304 --> 00:47:27,624
[Door creaks]

945
00:47:33,728 --> 00:47:37,062
[Whimpers]

946
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:39,957
Aah!

947
00:47:39,968 --> 00:47:44,370
[Breathing shakily]

948
00:48:01,355 --> 00:48:04,723
[Wind whistling]
