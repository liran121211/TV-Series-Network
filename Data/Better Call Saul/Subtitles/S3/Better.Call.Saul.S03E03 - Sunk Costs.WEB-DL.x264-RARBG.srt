3
00:02:20,119 --> 00:02:22,157
Yeah.

4
00:02:22,696 --> 00:02:25,438
May I assume that you are armed?

5
00:02:26,056 --> 00:02:27,540
Yes.

6
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:29,688
I do not wish to see your gun.

7
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,428
And if I don't,

8
00:02:31,892 --> 00:02:33,571
I promise you won't see mine.

9
00:02:34,462 --> 00:02:36,099
Are we in agreement?

10
00:02:36,306 --> 00:02:37,876
We are.

11
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:40,759
Expect two cars momentarily.

12
00:03:46,638 --> 00:03:49,497
You care to elaborate?

13
00:03:50,557 --> 00:03:55,433
It's not in my interest
for Hector Salamanca to die...

14
00:03:55,801 --> 00:03:57,601
at this time.

15
00:03:58,128 --> 00:03:59,456
Who is he to you?

16
00:03:59,581 --> 00:04:01,961
An associate of an associate.

17
00:04:02,214 --> 00:04:03,362
Mm.

18
00:04:04,003 --> 00:04:05,932
How very specific.

19
00:04:06,144 --> 00:04:08,276
Who is he to you?

20
00:04:09,514 --> 00:04:11,213
We had a disagreement.

21
00:04:11,636 --> 00:04:13,159
He threatened my family.

22
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,128
I'm not gonna let that go.

23
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:18,589
But you had let it go.

24
00:04:18,847 --> 00:04:20,613
You'd taken his money.

25
00:04:20,917 --> 00:04:22,972
Your family was no longer in danger.

26
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,181
And yet, still, you robbed his truck.

27
00:04:27,464 --> 00:04:29,401
Shouldn't that have settled the matter?

28
00:04:29,558 --> 00:04:31,958
Most men would have walked away,

29
00:04:32,448 --> 00:04:33,993
but instead...

30
00:04:34,417 --> 00:04:37,519
you made an attempt on his life.

31
00:04:38,323 --> 00:04:40,056
Why?

32
00:04:43,925 --> 00:04:48,407
I understand that a civilian
found the driver

33
00:04:48,683 --> 00:04:51,276
after you robbed the truck.

34
00:04:52,757 --> 00:04:57,126
Hector murdered this civilian, correct?

35
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,028
He wasn't in the game.

36
00:05:08,284 --> 00:05:10,456
I can't allow you to kill Hector.

37
00:05:10,992 --> 00:05:14,127
However, I am not completely
unsympathetic to your...

38
00:05:14,495 --> 00:05:16,713
sense of justice.

39
00:05:17,206 --> 00:05:20,284
You hurt Hector when you robbed that truck.

40
00:05:20,575 --> 00:05:22,842
You hurt his business,

41
00:05:23,011 --> 00:05:24,277
his pride.

42
00:05:24,549 --> 00:05:25,906
Quite effectively.

43
00:05:26,014 --> 00:05:31,050
And if you were to hurt him
in the same manner again,

44
00:05:32,097 --> 00:05:34,081
I would not stand in your way.

45
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:37,058
You want me to rob another truck.

46
00:05:37,215 --> 00:05:39,620
If you feel so inclined.

47
00:05:39,835 --> 00:05:42,469
I'm done with that.

48
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:46,620
Then our business here is finished.

49
00:05:46,788 --> 00:05:48,154
That's it?

50
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:49,729
That's it.

51
00:05:49,837 --> 00:05:51,070
No more tracker,

52
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,612
no more of your minions following me?

53
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,011
Just like that?

54
00:05:56,384 --> 00:05:57,549
Just like that.

55
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,386
Of course...

56
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:03,581
I trust that you are done
with Hector Salamanca?

57
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,011
Goodbye, Mr. Ehrmantraut.

58
00:06:19,433 --> 00:06:21,222
Wait.

59
00:06:24,995 --> 00:06:26,843
You want his trucks hit

60
00:06:26,878 --> 00:06:30,237
because you want to
disrupt his supply line.

61
00:06:30,925 --> 00:06:33,636
Hector's your competition.

62
00:06:34,757 --> 00:06:36,456
Why do you ask?

63
00:06:37,032 --> 00:06:40,245
Because I'm not done with Hector Salamanca.

64
00:06:54,913 --> 00:06:57,222
Offices of Jimmy McGill.
How may I help you today?

65
00:06:57,303 --> 00:06:59,534
- Hey. It's me.
- Oh, hey, Jimmy.

66
00:06:59,637 --> 00:07:03,573
Listen, um, something's come up,
and, uh, I need you

67
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:06,268
to reschedule all
my appointments for tomorrow.

68
00:07:06,632 --> 00:07:07,965
Oh, okay.

69
00:07:08,065 --> 00:07:09,956
When do you want me to reschedule for?

70
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:12,409
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

71
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:13,708
Sure thing.

72
00:07:13,758 --> 00:07:15,948
Oh, and, uh, do me a favor...

73
00:07:16,081 --> 00:07:18,557
tell Kim I won't be back in tonight.

74
00:07:18,745 --> 00:07:20,284
Will do.

75
00:07:23,175 --> 00:07:24,901
Okay. That's it.

76
00:07:25,597 --> 00:07:27,097
Have a great night!

77
00:07:27,297 --> 00:07:29,003
Mm.

78
00:07:56,747 --> 00:07:59,357
You know you can wait inside.

79
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:03,502
You won't want to hear it,

80
00:08:03,538 --> 00:08:05,471
but this is for the best.

81
00:08:07,462 --> 00:08:09,228
Please, Jimmy...

82
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:13,350
Whatever you think of me,

83
00:08:13,391 --> 00:08:14,613
whatever colorful names

84
00:08:14,649 --> 00:08:17,313
you're calling me in your head right now,

85
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:20,586
please understand I'm trying to help you.

86
00:08:22,183 --> 00:08:24,416
Here's what's going to happen.

87
00:08:25,193 --> 00:08:26,626
The police will arrest you,

88
00:08:26,693 --> 00:08:29,093
and I'm sorry,
but I will be pressing charges.

89
00:08:29,207 --> 00:08:31,844
I told you there would be consequences.

90
00:08:32,844 --> 00:08:34,680
But I have to believe

91
00:08:34,813 --> 00:08:36,618
that you'll face those consequences

92
00:08:36,712 --> 00:08:39,422
and you'll come out
the other side a better man.

93
00:08:39,522 --> 00:08:41,789
I know it's hard to see right now,

94
00:08:42,176 --> 00:08:44,510
but, Jimmy, this is an opportunity.

95
00:08:44,954 --> 00:08:46,378
That's why I'm doing this.

96
00:08:46,414 --> 00:08:47,594
Not to punish you.

97
00:08:47,682 --> 00:08:51,050
To show you, truly show you,

98
00:08:51,141 --> 00:08:55,508
that you have to make a change
before it's too late.

99
00:08:56,188 --> 00:08:58,591
Before you destroy yourself...

100
00:08:58,782 --> 00:09:00,192
or someone else.

101
00:09:00,719 --> 00:09:02,891
And I believe you can change.

102
00:09:03,132 --> 00:09:05,566
You'll find your path.

103
00:09:06,329 --> 00:09:07,833
And when you're ready,

104
00:09:08,001 --> 00:09:11,547
I will be there to help you walk that path.

105
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,643
Here's what's gonna happen.

106
00:09:17,994 --> 00:09:21,486
One day, you're gonna get sick... again.

107
00:09:21,743 --> 00:09:24,533
One of your employees
is gonna find you curled up

108
00:09:24,619 --> 00:09:28,611
in that space blanket,
take you to the hospital,

109
00:09:28,885 --> 00:09:35,427
hook you up to those machines
that beep and whir and... hurt.

110
00:09:35,682 --> 00:09:38,464
And this time, it'll be too much.

111
00:09:38,643 --> 00:09:42,869
And you will... die there.

112
00:09:43,634 --> 00:09:45,006
Alone.

113
00:09:51,948 --> 00:09:54,433
There's my ride.

114
00:10:13,668 --> 00:10:15,301
Sir, I need all your personal property,

115
00:10:15,336 --> 00:10:18,706
belts, ties, phone, rings, wallet.

116
00:10:29,856 --> 00:10:32,739
Need your socks and shoes
placed in that bag.

117
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:38,902
Put these on your feet.

118
00:10:42,954 --> 00:10:44,296
Turn to the right.

119
00:10:46,758 --> 00:10:48,934
Turn to the left.

120
00:10:49,978 --> 00:10:51,953
Face me.

121
00:10:52,558 --> 00:10:53,924
Left hand.

122
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,609
- Right hand.
- Holy hell.

123
00:11:11,742 --> 00:11:14,360
I thought they were bullshitting me.

124
00:11:14,929 --> 00:11:16,729
How the mighty have fallen.

125
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,929
What the hell happened, man?

126
00:11:18,996 --> 00:11:22,328
Nothing. Just family trouble.

127
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:23,863
You're married?

128
00:11:23,977 --> 00:11:26,311
No. Disagreement with my brother.

129
00:11:27,109 --> 00:11:28,193
That hardass?

130
00:11:28,273 --> 00:11:29,398
I don't blame ya.

131
00:11:29,484 --> 00:11:31,010
So who you got representing you?

132
00:11:31,045 --> 00:11:32,789
I'll be representing myself.

133
00:11:32,843 --> 00:11:34,999
- Sign here.
- Moron.

134
00:11:35,077 --> 00:11:36,444
'Course, I knew that

135
00:11:36,502 --> 00:11:39,570
when you left that sweet Davis & Main gig.

136
00:11:40,022 --> 00:11:41,146
This way.

137
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,749
Hey, speaking of...

138
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,093
they, uh, still trying

139
00:11:44,132 --> 00:11:45,741
- to replace you over there?
- Arms out.

140
00:11:46,001 --> 00:11:48,268
How's, uh, Omar?

141
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,250
Why? You looking to make a change?

142
00:11:50,364 --> 00:11:52,023
Well, leave all this glamour behind?

143
00:11:52,107 --> 00:11:53,890
Hey, who do you think's gonna catch this?

144
00:11:54,072 --> 00:11:55,979
Eh, it depends on who's
available when it comes in.

145
00:11:56,003 --> 00:11:57,843
- Face me.
- You think you might be available?

146
00:11:57,868 --> 00:11:59,491
Run your hands through your hair, please.

147
00:11:59,515 --> 00:12:01,874
Don't you wanna throw the book
at me for old times' sake?

148
00:12:02,015 --> 00:12:04,777
Mmm, I'll see if I can work some magic...

149
00:12:04,937 --> 00:12:06,968
but those decisions
are really above my paygrade.

150
00:12:07,007 --> 00:12:09,663
Oh, yeah? When did they
start paying you?

151
00:12:11,218 --> 00:12:12,754
Sit here.

152
00:12:12,874 --> 00:12:14,999
- I gotta run, anyway.
- Left hand.

153
00:12:15,156 --> 00:12:17,256
Just had to see it for myself...

154
00:12:18,116 --> 00:12:19,311
Jimmy McGill,

155
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:21,702
getting fingerprinted with the hoi polloi.

156
00:12:21,834 --> 00:12:24,168
Well, I'm glad you enjoyed the show.

157
00:12:27,968 --> 00:12:29,176
I'll check and see

158
00:12:29,201 --> 00:12:31,210
if I can get your first
appearance moved up.

159
00:12:31,505 --> 00:12:32,838
Thank you.

160
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,483
It's pretty late.

161
00:12:34,608 --> 00:12:36,843
Chances are, you're spending the night.

162
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:39,323
You, uh, gonna be okay?

163
00:12:40,054 --> 00:12:42,347
Beats the back of a nail salon.

164
00:12:42,874 --> 00:12:44,929
I do not doubt that, my friend.

165
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:49,433
Oh, pick the biggest guy.

166
00:12:49,523 --> 00:12:51,538
Punch him as hard as you can, okay?

167
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:52,892
Show dominance.

168
00:12:52,952 --> 00:12:55,093
Right. Got it. Dominance.

169
00:12:55,163 --> 00:12:57,460
You, uh, do know
how to throw a punch, right?

170
00:12:57,614 --> 00:13:00,257
Yeah, all right. Goodbye.

171
00:14:56,148 --> 00:14:58,038
Hey, Kim.

172
00:14:58,179 --> 00:14:59,588
Can I talk to you?

173
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:00,864
Sure, Ernie.

174
00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:01,952
What's going on?

175
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:05,186
Uh, Mr. McGill fired me.

176
00:15:06,757 --> 00:15:08,764
- Why? What happened?
- I don't...

177
00:15:11,108 --> 00:15:12,983
It doesn't matter.

178
00:15:13,588 --> 00:15:15,155
I just...

179
00:15:15,406 --> 00:15:16,647
Is Jimmy okay?

180
00:15:16,722 --> 00:15:18,671
I feel bad, like it's my fault.

181
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,397
I didn't mean for this to happen.

182
00:15:20,442 --> 00:15:22,804
What happened to Jimmy?

183
00:15:40,756 --> 00:15:43,107
- McGill?
- Yeah.

184
00:15:49,895 --> 00:15:51,700
You're up.

185
00:16:07,768 --> 00:16:13,538
We've got CR-2003113081.

186
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:18,651
James McGill.

187
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:20,258
Yes, Your Honor.

188
00:16:20,334 --> 00:16:23,135
Not how I'm used to
seeing you in here, Mr. McGill.

189
00:16:23,491 --> 00:16:25,565
Not how I'd like to be seen.

190
00:16:25,656 --> 00:16:28,534
Well, you had quite the day yesterday.

191
00:16:28,661 --> 00:16:29,893
Okay.

192
00:16:29,977 --> 00:16:32,128
Mr. McGill, you've been accused

193
00:16:32,254 --> 00:16:34,573
of fourth degree felony
breaking and entering,

194
00:16:34,657 --> 00:16:36,156
which carries a maximum sentence

195
00:16:36,224 --> 00:16:39,191
of 18 months and a $5,000 fine.

196
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:42,167
We've also got petty misdemeanor assault.

197
00:16:42,322 --> 00:16:45,893
Maximum six months' jail time
and a $500 fine.

198
00:16:46,051 --> 00:16:48,534
Plus, criminal damage to property,

199
00:16:48,621 --> 00:16:50,788
also misdemeanor with a maximum sentence

200
00:16:50,864 --> 00:16:53,026
of six months and a $500 fine.

201
00:16:53,236 --> 00:16:54,869
Victim is...

202
00:16:56,167 --> 00:16:57,831
Your brother Charles?

203
00:16:58,018 --> 00:16:59,463
Seriously?

204
00:17:00,721 --> 00:17:03,323
I assume you're prepared
to enter a plea at this time.

205
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,659
Yes, Your Honor.

206
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,737
I wish to enter a plea of not guilty.

207
00:17:08,578 --> 00:17:10,111
The court accepts

208
00:17:10,136 --> 00:17:12,362
and enters the defendant's plea
of not guilty.

209
00:17:12,676 --> 00:17:15,198
Now, Mr. McGill, have you secured counsel?

210
00:17:15,322 --> 00:17:17,260
Yes. Uh, Your Honor, Kim Wexler.

211
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:19,168
I'll be representing Mr. McGill
in this matter.

212
00:17:19,195 --> 00:17:20,526
Just in time.

213
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,870
Let's enter Ms. Wexler
as the attorney of record.

214
00:17:22,933 --> 00:17:26,838
Your Honor, if I may, um,
I'll be representing myself.

215
00:17:27,016 --> 00:17:30,317
I strongly advise against that, Mr. McGill.

216
00:17:30,447 --> 00:17:32,722
You know what they say about
a man who represents himself.

217
00:17:32,746 --> 00:17:34,345
Oh, I... I'm aware, but as you know,

218
00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:36,719
I've defended many people
in the criminal justice system.

219
00:17:36,743 --> 00:17:38,873
Your Honor, may I have a moment
to speak with my client?

220
00:17:38,897 --> 00:17:40,628
Sounds like he's not your client.

221
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:45,401
Mr. McGill, would you like to take a moment

222
00:17:45,477 --> 00:17:48,674
to discuss this with your...
potential counsel?

223
00:17:50,394 --> 00:17:52,260
No, Your Honor. I'm all set.

224
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:54,979
- I'm gonna represent myself.
- Your Honor...

225
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:56,238
Not your client, Ms. Wexler.

226
00:17:56,351 --> 00:17:57,471
I'm sorry. I'm moving on.

227
00:17:57,511 --> 00:17:59,232
You two can work this out on your own time.

228
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,885
I'm sorry. I was gonna call you,

229
00:18:00,932 --> 00:18:02,480
but then I thought I'd tell you in person.

230
00:18:02,504 --> 00:18:03,970
Mr. McGill.

231
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:07,456
So, on to the issue of bond.

232
00:18:09,151 --> 00:18:12,479
You have no priors
and no outstanding warrants.

233
00:18:12,598 --> 00:18:15,292
And where are you currently practicing law?

234
00:18:15,367 --> 00:18:17,601
I haven't seen you in my court in a while.

235
00:18:18,026 --> 00:18:19,482
Elder law.

236
00:18:20,088 --> 00:18:21,495
What a noble pursuit.

237
00:18:21,674 --> 00:18:23,854
One I hope you get back to very soon.

238
00:18:24,128 --> 00:18:25,706
Now, given your ties to the community,

239
00:18:25,784 --> 00:18:27,526
I see no reason to deny you bond,

240
00:18:27,579 --> 00:18:30,628
which I set now at $2,500.

241
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:00,371
I fucked up.

242
00:19:06,075 --> 00:19:08,160
Chuck bamboozled me again.

243
00:19:08,185 --> 00:19:09,285
That tape?

244
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:11,481
He made sure that
Ernie heard it, right?

245
00:19:11,571 --> 00:19:13,137
Because he knew Ernie, bless him,

246
00:19:13,297 --> 00:19:15,473
would tell me about it
and I would come over

247
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,520
to try to destroy it
or steal it or whatever.

248
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:18,660
Howard was there,

249
00:19:18,707 --> 00:19:21,012
and a P.I., if you can believe that,

250
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,254
just waiting for me

251
00:19:22,325 --> 00:19:24,332
to lose my shit and bust in.

252
00:19:24,447 --> 00:19:26,488
Chuck played me like a fiddle!

253
00:19:26,575 --> 00:19:29,342
And schmuck that I am, I fell for it!

254
00:19:29,689 --> 00:19:31,184
Moron.

255
00:19:32,335 --> 00:19:33,731
I'm sorry.

256
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,456
And then, I didn't call you,

257
00:19:35,514 --> 00:19:37,371
which is stupid,
and I'm sorry about that, too.

258
00:19:37,396 --> 00:19:39,363
But I didn't call you for a reason, okay?

259
00:19:39,388 --> 00:19:41,340
'Cause this is my screw-up.

260
00:19:41,405 --> 00:19:43,418
I own it, okay?

261
00:19:43,601 --> 00:19:45,879
It's my responsibility to fix it.

262
00:19:45,974 --> 00:19:47,121
And I know you want to help.

263
00:19:47,201 --> 00:19:49,449
Of course you do, 'cause you're wonderful.

264
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:53,176
But y-you're up to your ears in Mesa Verde.

265
00:19:53,277 --> 00:19:54,476
And I can't,

266
00:19:54,565 --> 00:19:57,299
I won't load this onto you, too.

267
00:19:57,391 --> 00:20:01,359
We have worked too hard
to let Chuck's bullshit vendetta

268
00:20:01,527 --> 00:20:03,694
threaten everything that we're building!

269
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:06,279
I won't allow him to endanger our business!

270
00:20:06,329 --> 00:20:08,637
No! I will fix this.

271
00:20:08,864 --> 00:20:10,981
Myself. Me. Jimmy McGill.

272
00:20:11,024 --> 00:20:12,074
Okay?

273
00:20:12,132 --> 00:20:14,499
You have gotta let me do this on my own.

274
00:20:19,488 --> 00:20:21,215
Okay.

275
00:20:27,378 --> 00:20:29,002
Thank you.

276
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:48,588
I, uh, I finished it.

277
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:52,476
I... I mean, I just touched up the edges.

278
00:20:52,671 --> 00:20:54,311
A little.

279
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:57,250
Is... Is that okay?

280
00:20:59,156 --> 00:21:00,421
Oh.

281
00:21:01,012 --> 00:21:03,613
Uh, sure.

282
00:21:04,231 --> 00:21:06,226
It looks nice.

283
00:21:09,065 --> 00:21:11,570
You mind driving me to my car?

284
00:21:11,741 --> 00:21:13,574
Sure. No problem.

285
00:21:16,337 --> 00:21:19,117
Um, just so you know,

286
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:22,250
this isn't a typical week around here.

287
00:21:23,585 --> 00:21:25,642
Yeah, totally.

288
00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:28,267
I... didn't think that it was.

289
00:21:28,639 --> 00:21:29,970
Ah.

290
00:21:58,036 --> 00:22:00,002
"Aaah!"

291
00:22:02,028 --> 00:22:03,474
Ah.

292
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,106
Mm-hmm.

293
00:22:12,099 --> 00:22:13,269
Mm.

294
00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:37,728
Mm?

295
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:54,037
Mm-hmm.

296
00:23:04,407 --> 00:23:05,773
Mr. Clark?

297
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:08,651
The doctor is ready.

298
00:23:13,282 --> 00:23:15,642
And how may I
help you today, Mr. Clark?

299
00:23:15,786 --> 00:23:18,821
I believe our mutual
acquaintance called ahead.

300
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:21,598
He told me what, but not how much.

301
00:23:22,259 --> 00:23:24,899
Mm. Well, I need a package...

302
00:23:25,214 --> 00:23:26,790
yea big.

303
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:30,456
And what's that in grams?

304
00:23:31,652 --> 00:23:34,353
Unh. This big.

305
00:25:13,441 --> 00:25:15,141
Hey.

306
00:25:15,628 --> 00:25:16,948
Hey.

307
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:18,707
Was somebody sitting here?

308
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:20,516
No.

309
00:25:27,018 --> 00:25:28,484
So, how was it?

310
00:25:28,645 --> 00:25:29,978
How was what?

311
00:25:30,802 --> 00:25:33,417
Your night in MDC.

312
00:25:34,322 --> 00:25:36,120
I caught up with a few old clients.

313
00:25:36,156 --> 00:25:37,229
Yeah?

314
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,369
- Want one?
- Oh.

315
00:25:40,822 --> 00:25:41,940
Yeah.

316
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:43,486
This whole thing is a...

317
00:25:43,634 --> 00:25:45,142
big misunderstanding.

318
00:25:45,182 --> 00:25:46,055
Mm-hmm.

319
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,463
There's absolutely no way
it's going to trial.

320
00:25:48,565 --> 00:25:50,924
Who wants that hassle? Not me.

321
00:25:51,096 --> 00:25:53,954
Whichever lucky soul at the
D.A.'s office catches this,

322
00:25:54,205 --> 00:25:55,889
looking at an easy clear.

323
00:25:55,924 --> 00:25:58,325
There's a felony in there, right?

324
00:25:58,986 --> 00:26:00,812
That would be a cla... Go ahead,

325
00:26:00,986 --> 00:26:03,041
classic case of overcharging.

326
00:26:03,158 --> 00:26:04,690
No offense.

327
00:26:05,182 --> 00:26:07,132
Happy to have a civil conversation,

328
00:26:07,182 --> 00:26:09,229
and I'm always ready to make a deal.

329
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:11,033
Just call me Monty Hall.

330
00:26:11,158 --> 00:26:13,707
So you're looking to plea out
on this, then, Monty?

331
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:16,111
If it's the right plea.

332
00:26:16,994 --> 00:26:18,311
I'm not perfect. Made mistakes.

333
00:26:18,347 --> 00:26:20,033
I'm willing to own up to them

334
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,588
in a way that is satisfying
to both myself and the state.

335
00:26:24,721 --> 00:26:25,938
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm.

336
00:26:25,963 --> 00:26:28,377
Well, good luck with that.

337
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:32,010
"Good luck with that" as in,
"I wish you well,"

338
00:26:32,088 --> 00:26:34,736
or, "I accept your challenge"?

339
00:26:35,072 --> 00:26:36,682
I wish you well.

340
00:26:36,947 --> 00:26:39,332
Play your cards right, they may go for it.

341
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:41,885
"They"? Not you?

342
00:26:42,274 --> 00:26:43,611
Prosecuting your case?

343
00:26:43,678 --> 00:26:45,545
Nah, man. It's not me.

344
00:26:47,479 --> 00:26:49,916
You never catch a lucky break, do ya?

345
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,088
- Bad timing?
- No, conflicted out.

346
00:26:53,346 --> 00:26:54,679
Conflicted out?

347
00:26:54,876 --> 00:26:56,236
I mean, I figured that'd happen.

348
00:26:56,385 --> 00:26:58,361
You and I have wheeled
and dealed together

349
00:26:58,416 --> 00:26:59,666
too many times.

350
00:26:59,755 --> 00:27:01,875
There was no way the boss
was letting me run that one.

351
00:27:03,166 --> 00:27:04,732
It's not Ericsen, is it?

352
00:27:04,768 --> 00:27:06,916
The whole Albuquerque office is out.

353
00:27:07,003 --> 00:27:08,602
We all know you, Jimmy.

354
00:27:08,705 --> 00:27:11,298
Well, who is it? I don't know.

355
00:27:11,369 --> 00:27:14,143
They're pulling in someone from Belen.

356
00:27:14,268 --> 00:27:16,486
Um... Hay?

357
00:27:16,687 --> 00:27:18,447
Something Hay, I think.

358
00:27:18,479 --> 00:27:19,459
I don't know.

359
00:27:19,484 --> 00:27:21,942
Boss used the words "tough but fair."

360
00:27:23,354 --> 00:27:24,739
Ahh.

361
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:26,713
Gotta jam.

362
00:27:32,773 --> 00:27:34,606
Good luck.

363
00:27:38,411 --> 00:27:40,727
Burger's getting cold.

364
00:27:41,552 --> 00:27:42,821
You want it?

365
00:27:42,846 --> 00:27:44,246
- Uh...
- Yeah?

366
00:27:44,271 --> 00:27:45,935
It has too many trans fats.

367
00:27:46,013 --> 00:27:46,833
Ohh!

368
00:27:46,869 --> 00:27:50,370
Those are the best fats.

369
00:27:54,037 --> 00:27:55,615
So they let you keep the car?

370
00:27:55,685 --> 00:27:57,248
- What?
- Davis & Main.

371
00:27:57,373 --> 00:28:00,529
They let you keep the, uh, German car?

372
00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:02,405
No.

373
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:04,351
That blows.

374
00:30:53,492 --> 00:30:54,988
Ms. Hay?

375
00:30:56,086 --> 00:30:58,383
- Mr. McGill?
- Chuck, please.

376
00:30:58,461 --> 00:30:59,992
Meet me at the front door.

377
00:31:00,055 --> 00:31:02,102
Uh, they said to put my things
in the mailbox.

378
00:31:02,211 --> 00:31:04,539
Yes, please. Anything with a battery.

379
00:31:10,977 --> 00:31:13,547
Did your brother ever
have a key to the house?

380
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:16,031
Before the recent trouble, he did.

381
00:31:16,477 --> 00:31:19,508
He brought me my groceries and sundries.

382
00:31:19,805 --> 00:31:22,024
But we had a falling-out.

383
00:31:22,391 --> 00:31:24,445
I have an employee who does all that now.

384
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:26,538
You took away your brother's key

385
00:31:26,563 --> 00:31:28,617
when you hired this employee?

386
00:31:28,709 --> 00:31:30,943
I changed the locks.

387
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:34,789
Going... Going back to the confrontation,

388
00:31:34,875 --> 00:31:38,344
so I have it absolutely clear,
did he strike you?

389
00:31:38,602 --> 00:31:40,234
No, nothing like that.

390
00:31:40,445 --> 00:31:42,258
He backed me into a cabinet.

391
00:31:42,396 --> 00:31:43,350
Did he have a weapon?

392
00:31:43,375 --> 00:31:44,555
Well, as I mentioned,

393
00:31:44,585 --> 00:31:47,063
he used a fireplace poker
to break into my desk.

394
00:31:47,422 --> 00:31:49,274
But he never would
have used it on me.

395
00:31:49,389 --> 00:31:51,389
Did you feel physically threatened?

396
00:31:52,445 --> 00:31:53,922
My brother is a lot of things,

397
00:31:53,984 --> 00:31:55,938
but even he has limits.

398
00:31:56,351 --> 00:31:58,007
And you're willing to
appear as a witness

399
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,853
even though he's family?

400
00:32:00,614 --> 00:32:02,380
Unfortunately, yes.

401
00:32:02,562 --> 00:32:04,531
If we continue with this,

402
00:32:04,749 --> 00:32:07,141
I'll need your sworn testimony.

403
00:32:07,863 --> 00:32:10,230
I've had situations
involving family members before

404
00:32:10,265 --> 00:32:14,242
where the injured party
has ultimately been reluctant

405
00:32:14,328 --> 00:32:16,007
to cooperate with my office.

406
00:32:16,109 --> 00:32:17,796
That won't happen.

407
00:32:20,875 --> 00:32:24,149
I'm curious about your strategy.

408
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,082
Well...

409
00:32:30,571 --> 00:32:32,922
as officers of the court,

410
00:32:33,086 --> 00:32:36,008
I feel we should be held
to a higher standard.

411
00:32:36,453 --> 00:32:38,183
I don't intend to take it
easy on your brother

412
00:32:38,207 --> 00:32:39,673
just because he's a lawyer.

413
00:32:39,715 --> 00:32:40,915
Of course not.

414
00:32:41,383 --> 00:32:42,461
The bone of contention

415
00:32:42,492 --> 00:32:44,399
is going to be the felony
breaking and entering.

416
00:32:44,477 --> 00:32:46,844
Your brother's gonna want
to plead down to a misdemeanor,

417
00:32:46,945 --> 00:32:49,500
but I'll hold the line on the felony.

418
00:32:50,005 --> 00:32:52,641
Which means this could
possibly go to trial.

419
00:32:54,102 --> 00:32:56,438
Now, I... I want to be mindful

420
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,367
of your comfort and well-being.

421
00:32:58,477 --> 00:32:59,578
With, with your condition,

422
00:32:59,827 --> 00:33:02,719
are you able to appear before the court?

423
00:33:02,744 --> 00:33:03,842
In person?

424
00:33:03,875 --> 00:33:06,086
I certainly appreciate you
accommodating me today

425
00:33:06,172 --> 00:33:07,387
by coming here,

426
00:33:07,422 --> 00:33:10,399
but don't worry,
I'm able to tolerate being out

427
00:33:10,438 --> 00:33:12,649
for short periods
with a few minor adjustments.

428
00:33:12,781 --> 00:33:15,735
Nothing that will
overly inconvenience the court.

429
00:33:17,607 --> 00:33:19,507
I'll get started on this.

430
00:33:22,837 --> 00:33:25,610
U-Unless you have other concerns.

431
00:33:26,347 --> 00:33:28,201
I just...

432
00:33:28,797 --> 00:33:31,210
I just keep thinking.

433
00:33:32,838 --> 00:33:34,695
You know, Jimmy has a good heart.

434
00:33:34,793 --> 00:33:36,159
I'm, I'm sure he does.

435
00:33:36,241 --> 00:33:38,297
It's not an excuse for what he's done.

436
00:33:38,666 --> 00:33:40,758
But he's my brother.

437
00:33:41,417 --> 00:33:44,719
And I know... well, he...

438
00:33:45,201 --> 00:33:47,188
well, he's emotional.
He flies off the handle.

439
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,078
I understand,

440
00:33:48,163 --> 00:33:49,556
but this is more than
flying off the handle.

441
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:52,119
I'm not going to defend his actions.

442
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:54,463
But I can't help wondering

443
00:33:54,507 --> 00:33:57,074
if there's not a better solution.

444
00:33:57,484 --> 00:33:58,850
For everyone.

445
00:38:40,162 --> 00:38:43,063
- You're good.
- Hold up.

446
00:38:45,634 --> 00:38:47,234
Okay, I can do that.

447
00:39:36,647 --> 00:39:38,619
Looks like we got a hit.

448
00:39:47,128 --> 00:39:48,871
Get down on your knees!

449
00:40:50,783 --> 00:40:53,110
Jesus. How old is this?

450
00:40:53,314 --> 00:40:55,165
I found it in the glove box.

451
00:40:55,262 --> 00:40:56,486
Best guess?

452
00:40:56,528 --> 00:40:59,095
From back when all the doors matched.

453
00:41:03,257 --> 00:41:06,952
I got a deal offer from the ADA today.

454
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,466
And?

455
00:41:09,564 --> 00:41:11,338
It's not what I expected.

456
00:41:11,462 --> 00:41:13,213
Bad not what you expected?

457
00:41:14,322 --> 00:41:16,150
It's just that...

458
00:41:16,422 --> 00:41:18,181
It's different.

459
00:41:19,098 --> 00:41:22,332
She's offering me
Pre-Prosecution Diversion.

460
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:24,493
Seriously?

461
00:41:24,613 --> 00:41:26,494
A PPD?

462
00:41:28,309 --> 00:41:30,767
That's great, Jimmy.

463
00:41:31,908 --> 00:41:33,461
Best I could hope for, right?

464
00:41:33,513 --> 00:41:34,746
Right.

465
00:41:35,828 --> 00:41:37,782
What does she want you to confess to?

466
00:41:37,903 --> 00:41:40,353
All of it. The felony B and E.

467
00:41:40,439 --> 00:41:43,408
Uh, misdemeanor petty assault
and property damage.

468
00:41:43,437 --> 00:41:46,671
I never touched him,
but they got assault in there.

469
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:48,681
Well, could be worse.

470
00:41:48,775 --> 00:41:50,353
As long as they never activate it,

471
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:51,938
it doesn't matter, right?

472
00:41:52,447 --> 00:41:55,736
You gonna be able to keep your
nose clean for a whole year?

473
00:41:55,851 --> 00:41:58,236
Keep "Viktor" with a "k" on lockdown?

474
00:41:58,341 --> 00:42:00,441
It's not a problem, Giselle.

475
00:42:00,758 --> 00:42:03,954
And if I don't, it's instant jail, right?

476
00:42:05,368 --> 00:42:06,767
Lucky break.

477
00:42:07,655 --> 00:42:10,389
She must not want the hassle of a trial.

478
00:42:10,634 --> 00:42:12,548
Guess so.

479
00:42:13,618 --> 00:42:15,259
Jimmy...

480
00:42:15,487 --> 00:42:17,020
this is good news.

481
00:42:17,689 --> 00:42:19,439
And Chuck is gonna be pissed.

482
00:42:19,479 --> 00:42:21,446
It's a big check in the "pro" column.

483
00:42:21,592 --> 00:42:25,194
Actually, the PPD was Chuck's idea.

484
00:42:26,191 --> 00:42:27,540
Shit.

485
00:42:27,682 --> 00:42:29,251
Yeah.

486
00:42:31,124 --> 00:42:33,142
What's his game?

487
00:42:33,492 --> 00:42:37,509
One condition of the PPD
is that my written confession

488
00:42:37,587 --> 00:42:41,009
is immediately submitted to
the New Mexico Bar Association.

489
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:43,093
Your written felony confession.

490
00:42:43,207 --> 00:42:45,025
Yeah. I thought he wanted me in jail.

491
00:42:45,076 --> 00:42:47,447
He just wants my law license.

492
00:42:50,819 --> 00:42:52,819
What are you gonna do?

493
00:42:53,283 --> 00:42:54,712
Well...

494
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:57,540
I knew the bar was gonna
be an issue, right?

495
00:42:57,593 --> 00:42:59,150
So I figured I'd plea the charges down

496
00:42:59,184 --> 00:43:01,087
to a couple misdemeanors, get a censure,

497
00:43:01,166 --> 00:43:03,876
and maybe a little suspension, but...

498
00:43:04,591 --> 00:43:06,431
a confession to a felony?

499
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:08,407
Grounds for disbarment.

500
00:43:08,708 --> 00:43:11,040
Yeah. And if I take it to trial and I lose,

501
00:43:11,168 --> 00:43:14,267
I face the bar anyways
and jail time, most likely.

502
00:43:14,874 --> 00:43:17,107
He's got me boxed in.

503
00:43:20,204 --> 00:43:21,603
You can fight this.

504
00:43:21,668 --> 00:43:24,101
The disciplinary board listens
to extenuating circumstances.

505
00:43:24,169 --> 00:43:26,636
No, Chuck knows everybody at the bar.

506
00:43:26,726 --> 00:43:28,439
Hell, he made half their careers.

507
00:43:28,526 --> 00:43:31,314
It's gonna be him and
his cronies versus me.

508
00:43:31,457 --> 00:43:32,923
Alone.

509
00:43:36,433 --> 00:43:38,917
- Not alone.
- Kim.

510
00:43:39,093 --> 00:43:41,059
Come on, Jimmy.

511
00:43:41,782 --> 00:43:43,307
You need me.

512
00:43:43,434 --> 00:43:45,245
You can't argue this yourself.

513
00:43:45,354 --> 00:43:46,432
You and I both know that.

514
00:43:46,567 --> 00:43:49,604
And I'm not gonna let you
fight this on your own.

515
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:54,615
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

516
00:43:55,416 --> 00:43:57,550
'Cause I don't...

517
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:01,011
Why would you...

518
00:44:02,532 --> 00:44:03,865
Come on.

519
00:44:04,181 --> 00:44:05,440
This guy?

520
00:44:05,535 --> 00:44:06,901
Seriously?

521
00:44:11,595 --> 00:44:15,096
Let's just call it
the fallacy of sunk costs.

522
00:44:18,298 --> 00:44:19,864
So what now?

523
00:44:19,922 --> 00:44:21,222
Now?

524
00:44:21,305 --> 00:44:23,432
Now we, uh, take that PPD,

525
00:44:23,487 --> 00:44:26,655
and we shove it right up Chuck's ass.
