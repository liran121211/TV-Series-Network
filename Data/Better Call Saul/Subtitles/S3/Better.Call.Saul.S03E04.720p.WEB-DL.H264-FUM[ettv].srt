1
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:17,369
Whoa.

2
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,407
Whoa.

3
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:16,788
<i>Guau.</i>

4
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:32,878
Pop?

5
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,212
Hey, honey.

6
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:36,581
Almost didn't recognize
the number.

7
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:37,916
I'm sorry.

8
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:39,618
They changed my hours
up at work.

9
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,586
I'm still gettin' used to it.

10
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:44,256
How are you two?

11
00:08:44,258 --> 00:08:45,724
We're great.

12
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:47,626
Did it go okay?

13
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:49,895
Yeah, yeah,
thanks to those movers you got.

14
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:52,130
All I had to do was watch.

15
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:56,001
And, Pop, this house...

16
00:08:56,003 --> 00:08:57,068
It's good?

17
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,104
It's great.

18
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:00,672
Kaylee loves her new school.

19
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:02,040
The neighborhood's friendly.

20
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,242
We feel safe.

21
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:06,111
That's good.

22
00:09:06,113 --> 00:09:08,713
Mike, I don't know
how to thank you.

23
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,849
Well, you don't hafta.

24
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:13,885
I'm just glad
you're enjoying it.

25
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,820
Do you want to come over
for dinner?

26
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:17,255
Tonight?

27
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:20,325
Sure. I'm making lasagna.
There'll be plenty.

28
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,697
Well, that's very sweet,
but I don't want to put you out.

29
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:27,265
Pop-pop, come over!

30
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:30,669
There's someone here
who wants to see you.

31
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:48,086
Ice cream!

32
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:50,922
Is she snoozing?

33
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:53,592
Close.

34
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:55,060
Ice cream?

35
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:57,896
I shoulda let
well enough alone.

36
00:09:57,898 --> 00:10:00,098
<i>Well, I can't understand it.</i>

37
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,800
<i>According to the map,</i>

38
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:02,834
<i>we were supposed to be taking</i>
<i>a shortcut.</i>

39
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:04,302
I'm good.

40
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:06,304
You sure?  Yeh.

41
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:07,739
I'll have his.

42
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:09,207
I don't think so.

43
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:12,010
<i>Maybe we can get a lift.</i>

44
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:22,220
<i> Hey!</i>
<i>What's the matter?</i>

45
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:23,755
<i>There's some guys</i>
<i>hanging around the truck.</i>

46
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:24,956
<i>Air Raid Wardens?</i>

47
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,358
<i>No, these is</i>
<i>funny-lookin' guys.</i>

48
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,059
<i>What do you mean</i>
<i>"funny-lookin'"?</i>

49
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:29,761
<i>I mean funny-lookin',</i>
<i>like fish.</i>

50
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:32,030
<i>Who are you kidding?</i>
<i>What do you mean "like fish"?</i>

51
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:33,365
<i>They got scales.</i> Hey.

52
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:34,966
<i>Where? All over 'em!</i>

53
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,167
You okay?

54
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:39,938
Yeah, I'm... I'm fine.

55
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,240
<i>They're off a flyin' saucer,</i>
<i>off a sputnik.</i>

56
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:44,142
<i>Look! They've seen us!</i>

57
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:46,044
<i>Let's get outta here!</i>

58
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:49,714
<i>They're from outer space.</i>
<i>They're off a flying saucer!</i>

59
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,287
Receipt.

60
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,924
Welcome to Los Polios Hermanos.
May I take your order?

61
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:35,293
<i>¿Tu jefe esta aquí?</i>

62
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:39,364
<i>¿Donde esta?</i>

63
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,066
Men's room is over there
on the left.

64
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:45,003
Sir, if... <i> Cabrón,</i> I
need to see your boss.

65
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:47,338
Okay. Well, I'm...
I'm the assistant manager.

66
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,907
The manager's actually
not here today.

67
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:52,911
Not the manager... the boss.

68
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:55,246
You mean Mr. Fring? Mr. Fring.

69
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:58,483
O-Okay, well, he's not here
at the moment.

70
00:11:58,485 --> 00:12:01,086
I'm sure I could help you
with whatever you need.

71
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:04,155
I need Fring.

72
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:05,757
Well, like I said,
he's not here,

73
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,225
and I don't really know
when he'll be back.

74
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:08,993
I can... I can take a message.

75
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:10,895
I'll wait.

76
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:15,133
You... You don't
have to do that.

77
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:16,835
I'd be happy to take a message.

78
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:19,170
I'm sure Mr. Fring wouldn't
want to keep you waiting.

79
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:25,877
Okay, sir,
if you... if you don't mind,

80
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:27,445
there are oth...
there are other customers.

81
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:32,016
S-sorry about that.

82
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:34,819
Welcome to Los Polios Hermanos.
May I take your order?

83
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:36,988
Yeah,
can I get a 12-piece bucket,

84
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:40,291
with jumbo fries and...

85
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:43,061
- You said the 12-piece?
- Yeah, the 12-piece.

86
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:45,096
Okay.

87
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,831
Excuse me, sir.

88
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,032
You can't light that in here.

89
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:49,334
Sir!

90
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:52,270
There's no smoking
on the premises.

91
00:12:53,507 --> 00:12:55,774
Please, sir,
look... look at the signs.

92
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:57,442
<i>No fumar.</i>

93
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:02,046
You can't. That's... It's a...
It's a health-code violation.

94
00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:10,213
Sir, it's employees only.
We have to go, okay? Let's go.

95
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:13,057
Sir!

96
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:24,035
Sir!

97
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:36,080
Sir, you're not allowed
back here.

98
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:54,966
Gus Fring is a pillar of our
local business community,

99
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:57,335
and not just for underwriting
our travel raffle,

100
00:13:57,337 --> 00:14:00,004
but for making the best
damn chicken in town!

101
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:03,274
Gus. Thank you.

102
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:05,009
Thank you.

103
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,945
Well, gentlemen, ladies,

104
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:09,414
I-I hope to never need
your services...

105
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,883
I mean, no offense...
but if I ever did,

106
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:13,117
it's good to know that...

107
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:32,604
Yes?

108
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,350
I'll be right there.

109
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:12,076
I want you all to go home now.

110
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:15,380
You will be compensated
for your full shifts.

111
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:17,348
Normal schedule tomorrow.

112
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:23,988
Go now.

113
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,190
We are closed for today.

114
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:38,036
Mr. Fring, y-you sure you want
to be left with these guys?

115
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:39,404
I'm fine, Lyle.

116
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:40,638
You go home.

117
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,673
Should I call someone?

118
00:15:41,675 --> 00:15:43,708
No.

119
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,643
That will not be necessarily.
Truly.

120
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:47,178
Are you sure?

121
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,013
Please do as I ask.

122
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:50,548
I'll see you tomorrow.

123
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:03,561
He's waiting in the office.

124
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:06,230
I know where he is.

125
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,971
Don Hector.

126
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:15,273
Took you long enough.

127
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,253
Don Hector,

128
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:36,661
mine is a cartel business,
but it is mine.

129
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,629
And it is legitimate.

130
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:42,000
My employees are civilians.

131
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:45,370
Your actions here today
have endangered them,

132
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:49,407
my interests,
and those of the cartel.

133
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,611
<i>I</i> am the cartel.

134
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:56,180
And from now on,
you are my mule.

135
00:16:56,182 --> 00:17:00,251
You are going to bring
my product north.

136
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:04,122
<i>Mierda.</i>

137
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:18,202
I understand that your supply
line has been compromised,

138
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:21,205
and this is most unfortunate.

139
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:25,743
However, my trucks are already
at maximum capacity.

140
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:27,745
Make room.

141
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:33,084
Don Hector, you must understand
that I answer to Juan Bolsa.

142
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:36,554
You want to cry to Bolsa,
cry to Bolsa.

143
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:39,457
Or, hell, Eladio.

144
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:43,428
Adding more product
will threaten

145
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:47,265
the reliability
of the entire operation.

146
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:52,537
May I ask...
did Don Eladio approve this?

147
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:58,676
<i>I</i> approve this.

148
00:18:08,121 --> 00:18:10,621
You're doin' it.

149
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:04,302
You gonna let me out of here?

150
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:06,537
Hello?

151
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,681
Tell him we're square.

152
00:20:16,683 --> 00:20:17,748
What?

153
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,684
No.

154
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:47,705
Excuse me, everyone.

155
00:21:47,707 --> 00:21:50,741
Could you all please take
a moment and join me out here?

156
00:21:50,743 --> 00:21:52,710
Please, come.

157
00:21:55,615 --> 00:21:57,915
Come, come, come.

158
00:22:07,593 --> 00:22:09,994
I would,

159
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:14,432
I would like to apologize
to each and every one of you

160
00:22:14,434 --> 00:22:20,071
who, yesterday, had to endure
the behavior of those men.

161
00:22:20,073 --> 00:22:23,774
It was unacceptable.

162
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:27,678
Despite the difficult
circumstances,

163
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:32,550
you all acquitted yourselves
impeccably.

164
00:22:32,552 --> 00:22:36,887
That said, if any of you wish
to seek counseling

165
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:39,623
due to lingering trauma,

166
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:44,528
speak with me privately,
and it will be arranged.

167
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:49,066
Also, you will all be receiving
24 hours of overtime,

168
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:51,502
as I am sure,
in one way or another,

169
00:22:51,504 --> 00:22:53,738
each of you brought
this incident home with you.

170
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,140
Yes, Lyle?

171
00:22:56,142 --> 00:23:01,078
Mr. Fring...
who were those guys?

172
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:07,151
Well, some of you know,
that many years ago,

173
00:23:07,153 --> 00:23:09,487
I opened my first
Los Polios Hermanos

174
00:23:09,489 --> 00:23:12,523
in Michoacán.

175
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:20,731
Shortly thereafter,
those same men showed up.

176
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:23,100
They wanted money.

177
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:31,075
And I-I am... I'm ashamed
to say that I paid them.

178
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:35,413
You see, in that place,
at that time,

179
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:40,551
if I wished to conduct
my business... I had no choice.

180
00:23:40,553 --> 00:23:46,457
But yesterday...

181
00:23:46,459 --> 00:23:50,895
yesterday, they came here.

182
00:23:50,897 --> 00:23:52,563
Here.

183
00:23:54,467 --> 00:23:57,067
They intimidated my customers.

184
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:59,937
They threatened my employees.

185
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:05,676
And, again, they wanted money.

186
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:10,047
Now, my friends,
I-I must confess

187
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:13,551
that I almost gave them
what they wanted.

188
00:24:13,553 --> 00:24:16,854
But then, I thought, "No."

189
00:24:16,856 --> 00:24:18,722
No.

190
00:24:18,724 --> 00:24:22,726
"This is America."

191
00:24:22,728 --> 00:24:26,897
Here, the righteous have
no reason to fear.

192
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:30,801
Here, those men have no power.

193
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:33,771
And when they saw that I had
no fear of them,

194
00:24:33,773 --> 00:24:36,006
they ran
like the cowards they are.

195
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:39,844
Back across the border.

196
00:24:39,846 --> 00:24:42,746
They will not return.

197
00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:46,016
We will move on from this.

198
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:48,652
My friends,

199
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:53,624
I promise you...

200
00:24:53,626 --> 00:24:57,495
that together, we will prosper.

201
00:24:57,497 --> 00:25:00,130
All right.

202
00:25:04,537 --> 00:25:08,272
Yes, hi. I'm still here.

203
00:25:08,274 --> 00:25:10,674
Really? Are you sure?

204
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:12,209
Sure. Gotcha.

205
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:14,178
Sorry for bothering you.

206
00:25:18,584 --> 00:25:20,251
Hi. I'm calling because

207
00:25:20,253 --> 00:25:24,822
we had an appointment with you
guys for, I think, Wednesday?

208
00:25:24,824 --> 00:25:26,824
I'll be honest with you...

209
00:25:26,826 --> 00:25:29,293
I can barely read
my own darn handwriting.

210
00:25:29,295 --> 00:25:30,995
My mistake.

211
00:25:30,997 --> 00:25:32,763
Okay. Have a nice day.

212
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:40,938
Hello. I'm calling to confirm an
appointment for Charles McGill.

213
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,542
Yes, it's 215
San Cristobal Road...

214
00:25:44,544 --> 00:25:46,143
McGill, with an "M."

215
00:25:46,145 --> 00:25:47,177
A door?

216
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:48,546
Okay.

217
00:25:48,548 --> 00:25:50,281
I thought it was you guys.

218
00:25:50,283 --> 00:25:51,682
Guess I was wrong.

219
00:25:51,684 --> 00:25:52,917
Thanks, anyway.

220
00:25:54,654 --> 00:25:57,955
Hi! I'm calling about an
appointment for Charles McGill.

221
00:25:57,957 --> 00:26:00,624
Well, that's why I'm calling.

222
00:26:00,626 --> 00:26:03,027
I think it's for this week,
but...

223
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:05,162
Good thing my head's attached
to my neck  right?

224
00:26:05,164 --> 00:26:06,897
San Cristobal... that's right.

225
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:10,901
Yes, that's it! 2:30 tomorrow.

226
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,603
Great!

227
00:26:12,605 --> 00:26:16,140
So, we're gonna need
to cancel that.

228
00:26:16,142 --> 00:26:17,341
Yeah.

229
00:26:17,343 --> 00:26:18,943
I will.

230
00:26:18,945 --> 00:26:21,011
Thank you. Bye.

231
00:26:25,585 --> 00:26:28,052
Poor Frisky.

232
00:26:28,054 --> 00:26:31,755
Pomeranians can
be difficult... all that hair.

233
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:33,691
I know.

234
00:26:33,693 --> 00:26:36,093
So, Mrs. Valiance,
does Thursday 11:30 work?

235
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:38,262
That's right.

236
00:26:39,865 --> 00:26:41,632
No.

237
00:26:41,634 --> 00:26:43,000
Really?

238
00:26:43,002 --> 00:26:45,903
Martin's Handyman and Repair...
2:30 tomorrow.

239
00:26:45,905 --> 00:26:47,304
Thank you.

240
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:49,206
How many calls did that take?

241
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:51,642
I lost track. Is that it?

242
00:26:51,644 --> 00:26:53,944
Yeah. I'm nearly done.

243
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:56,747
I'm just giving it
a remorse pass.

244
00:26:56,749 --> 00:26:58,649
Well, remorse is important.

245
00:27:05,324 --> 00:27:08,626
"Destroyed property."

246
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:13,030
I'd try "damaged"
the victim's property

247
00:27:13,032 --> 00:27:15,065
instead of
"destroyed" property.

248
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:17,234
See if you can't
get away with that.

249
00:27:17,236 --> 00:27:18,936
Yeah.

250
00:27:24,377 --> 00:27:26,076
Boom.

251
00:27:26,078 --> 00:27:27,678
That's nice.

252
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:31,682
I mean it, by the way.

253
00:27:31,684 --> 00:27:33,250
What?

254
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,020
Thank you.

255
00:27:36,022 --> 00:27:38,222
Seriously.

256
00:27:39,925 --> 00:27:41,925
You're welcome seriously.

257
00:27:44,764 --> 00:27:45,963
I better get back to it.

258
00:27:45,965 --> 00:27:48,265
Yeah.

259
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:49,900
Are you...?

260
00:27:49,902 --> 00:27:54,138
You're absolutely sure
you got the right guy for this?

261
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:57,975
The crème de la crème.

262
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,940
Martin's Repair?

263
00:28:29,942 --> 00:28:31,341
Yeah. Mr. McGill?

264
00:28:31,343 --> 00:28:32,810
Good afternoon.

265
00:28:32,812 --> 00:28:34,244
If you don't mind
wiping your shoes?

266
00:28:37,116 --> 00:28:39,083
It's this way.

267
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:46,423
Mind... Mind the step here.

268
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:49,259
As you'll see,
the frame is boarded over,

269
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:52,362
but the, 
the door itself is intact.

270
00:28:52,364 --> 00:28:55,132
The damage is mainly
to the doorjamb and the casing.

271
00:28:55,134 --> 00:28:57,101
There's another step up here.

272
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:10,948
Break-in?

273
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,783
That's right.

274
00:29:14,487 --> 00:29:19,223
Went after your copper wire,
from the look of it.

275
00:29:20,526 --> 00:29:22,426
There was a time...
remember?...

276
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:24,962
when we could leave
our doors unlocked.

277
00:29:24,964 --> 00:29:26,363
I certainly do.

278
00:29:26,365 --> 00:29:29,266
Well...

279
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:31,034
Where do I plug in?

280
00:29:31,036 --> 00:29:32,136
You don't.

281
00:29:32,138 --> 00:29:33,403
No? No.

282
00:29:33,405 --> 00:29:35,305
Didn't you...

283
00:29:35,307 --> 00:29:38,008
I believe my assistant was very
clear with your dispatcher...

284
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:39,777
no electricity,

285
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:42,946
due to a condition that was
explained in some detail.

286
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:47,251
No problem.

287
00:29:47,253 --> 00:29:48,986
Good thing I charged
my battery.

288
00:29:48,988 --> 00:29:51,989
I'd be going at it like
Fred Flintstone, otherwise.

289
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:55,192
I'm sorry!

290
00:29:55,194 --> 00:29:56,994
I'm sorry!

291
00:29:56,996 --> 00:29:59,029
I understood there would be
no power tools of any kind.

292
00:29:59,031 --> 00:30:01,098
What?
A screwdriver and a hammer?

293
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,267
Turns a morning job
into two days

294
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:05,536
with me, myself, and Bengay.

295
00:30:05,538 --> 00:30:07,371
But... it's your call.

296
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:13,510
I suppose...

297
00:30:13,512 --> 00:30:15,179
Very well, if...

298
00:30:25,191 --> 00:30:27,491
You seem to be making
fast work of it.

299
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:31,195
That's good. That's good.

300
00:30:31,197 --> 00:30:33,230
Um, okay, what I'll do,
I think, is...

301
00:32:10,195 --> 00:32:12,629
Very good.

302
00:32:12,631 --> 00:32:14,564
Yeah.

303
00:32:14,566 --> 00:32:16,033
Nice.

304
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:20,537
Great.  Yep, nice.

305
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:22,105
At some point,

306
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:24,308
we should probably discuss
the rule of thirds,

307
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:26,543
but, otherwise, these...

308
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:30,147
Wow. Yep.

309
00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:34,184
A gas lantern sitting on a stack
of friggin'<i> Financial Times.</i>

310
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:35,619
Now, that tells
the whole story.

311
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:38,121
These are museum quality.

312
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:39,423
You, my friend,

313
00:32:39,425 --> 00:32:42,459
are the Ansel Adams
of covert photography.

314
00:32:43,662 --> 00:32:46,263
And that other thing?

315
00:32:59,712 --> 00:33:01,278
How'd you get it?

316
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,681
Address book on his desk.

317
00:33:04,683 --> 00:33:06,583
Right.

318
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:13,223
So... What'dya think of him?

319
00:33:13,225 --> 00:33:16,126
I mean, speak freely.
You couldn't possibly offend me.

320
00:33:16,128 --> 00:33:19,196
He's a bit of a prick, right?

321
00:33:20,766 --> 00:33:23,100
Nothing?

322
00:33:23,102 --> 00:33:24,434
Seriously?

323
00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:27,170
All right.

324
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:29,539
Can't even dish the dirt
with this guy.

325
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:32,376
Isn't our business concluded?

326
00:33:32,378 --> 00:33:34,344
Yeah, even Steven.

327
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:37,614
I mean, you did fix
the door, right?

328
00:33:37,616 --> 00:33:39,082
Yeah.

329
00:33:39,084 --> 00:33:41,151
Y-You did a reasonably
good job of it?

330
00:33:41,153 --> 00:33:43,320
Because, otherwise, he'll be...
He won't be grumbling to anyone.

331
00:33:43,322 --> 00:33:44,588
That's all I'm asking.

332
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:46,790
I did it right.

333
00:33:46,792 --> 00:33:48,658
Thank you.

334
00:33:50,229 --> 00:33:53,764
Nice to fix something for once.

335
00:33:53,766 --> 00:33:56,033
Hell, if that's how you feel,

336
00:33:56,035 --> 00:33:58,602
I got a leaky toilet
back at the office.

337
00:33:58,604 --> 00:33:59,770
All right.

338
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,740
If you ever need anything
from my end...

339
00:34:06,178 --> 00:34:08,045
<i>Hasta luego.</i>

340
00:34:43,082 --> 00:34:44,848
May we talk?

341
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:50,353
You can park it over there.

342
00:35:13,178 --> 00:35:15,545
You sent back the payment
we agreed upon.

343
00:35:17,649 --> 00:35:21,384
What I did,
I didn't do for you.

344
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:27,324
The man.

345
00:35:27,326 --> 00:35:30,460
The one killed for helping
the truck driver.

346
00:35:32,197 --> 00:35:36,266
If I may make an observation...

347
00:35:36,268 --> 00:35:38,368
Perhaps you are trying
to correct something

348
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:39,870
which cannot be corrected.

349
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,275
It's not the kind of thing
I want to take money for.

350
00:35:45,277 --> 00:35:47,844
But the fact remains
that your actions

351
00:35:47,846 --> 00:35:49,913
benefited me more
than you can know.

352
00:35:49,915 --> 00:35:52,182
That's your business.

353
00:35:52,184 --> 00:35:56,920
I'm just glad to have Salamanca
out of my head.

354
00:36:01,226 --> 00:36:03,760
Well, perhaps, in the future...

355
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:06,463
you will consider
working for me.

356
00:36:15,474 --> 00:36:18,208
Could be.

357
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:19,943
That'd depend on the work.

358
00:36:34,326 --> 00:36:35,592
Would you care to know

359
00:36:35,594 --> 00:36:39,930
why I stopped you
from killing Hector?

360
00:36:39,932 --> 00:36:43,800
Like you said...
it wasn't in your interest.

361
00:36:45,571 --> 00:36:50,307
A bullet to the head
would have been far too humane.

362
00:37:36,855 --> 00:37:39,022
Jimmy.

363
00:37:39,024 --> 00:37:40,991
Howard.

364
00:37:53,672 --> 00:37:55,405
Jimmy.

365
00:38:13,425 --> 00:38:15,392
Howard.

366
00:38:15,394 --> 00:38:16,393
Kim.

367
00:38:16,395 --> 00:38:17,627
Chuck.

368
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:19,329
Kim.

369
00:38:50,862 --> 00:38:53,063
Good afternoon.

370
00:38:53,065 --> 00:38:56,433
Good.

371
00:38:56,435 --> 00:38:57,734
Mr. McGill,
does this work for you?

372
00:38:57,736 --> 00:39:00,070
It'll have to do. Thank you.

373
00:39:00,072 --> 00:39:01,805
I assume everyone left

374
00:39:01,807 --> 00:39:04,874
their cellphones and so on
at reception.

375
00:39:04,876 --> 00:39:06,609
Yes, indeed.

376
00:39:06,611 --> 00:39:09,679
And you'll let me know if you
need a break or anything else?

377
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:11,581
I will.
Thank you, Ms. Hay.

378
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:13,717
You know...

379
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:17,120
I was actually speaking to my
husband about your condition.

380
00:39:17,122 --> 00:39:18,988
Yes?

381
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:20,623
I had an aunt.
She's no longer with us.

382
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:22,592
She went to church
every Sunday,

383
00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:24,861
but when the boys' choir sang,

384
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:27,030
she would absolutely
have to leave.

385
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:29,899
Something about
the frequency of their voices

386
00:39:29,901 --> 00:39:31,534
really did a number on her.

387
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:33,737
Well, that is a shame. Indeed.

388
00:39:33,739 --> 00:39:36,940
All right.

389
00:39:36,942 --> 00:39:39,909
Let's get down to it.

390
00:39:41,113 --> 00:39:42,812
We are here to finalize

391
00:39:42,814 --> 00:39:46,516
the Pre-Prosecution Diversion
for James Morgan McGill.

392
00:39:46,518 --> 00:39:50,120
Representing the divertee,
Ms. Kimberly Wexler.

393
00:39:50,122 --> 00:39:52,655
Mr. James McGill
has signed a contract

394
00:39:52,657 --> 00:39:54,457
waiving his rights
to a speedy trial

395
00:39:54,459 --> 00:39:55,992
and presentment of his case

396
00:39:55,994 --> 00:39:58,395
within the statute
of limitations.

397
00:39:58,397 --> 00:40:00,597
The terms of the deal are
for you, James,

398
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:02,832
to report to your
Pre-Prosecution Service Officer

399
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:05,135
at the Albuquerque
District Attorney's Office

400
00:40:05,137 --> 00:40:07,570
on the second Monday
of every month

401
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:08,972
for the next 12 months.

402
00:40:08,974 --> 00:40:12,742
Community service hours
will be assigned.

403
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:15,512
You must maintain
lawful employment.

404
00:40:15,514 --> 00:40:18,715
Must only associate
with law-abiding citizens.

405
00:40:18,717 --> 00:40:20,617
Your client understands that,

406
00:40:20,619 --> 00:40:23,186
if he violates
the terms of the agreement

407
00:40:23,188 --> 00:40:25,755
or is arrested
for any infraction,

408
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:27,757
the crimes to which
he has confessed here

409
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:30,460
will be prosecuted
to the full extent of the law,

410
00:40:30,462 --> 00:40:31,861
in addition to any new charges?

411
00:40:31,863 --> 00:40:33,463
He understands.

412
00:40:33,465 --> 00:40:35,031
And I must inform you,
Mr. McGill,

413
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:38,835
as an officer of the court
and member of the bar,

414
00:40:38,837 --> 00:40:40,904
your confession will be referred

415
00:40:40,906 --> 00:40:43,540
to the New Mexico
Bar Association.

416
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:46,843
Okay.
I have your statement here.

417
00:40:46,845 --> 00:40:49,546
Has everyone had
a chance to read it?

418
00:40:49,548 --> 00:40:51,214
Comments? Thoughts?

419
00:40:51,216 --> 00:40:53,082
Actually, page 2,

420
00:40:53,084 --> 00:40:55,985
he "damaged the victim's
property."

421
00:40:55,987 --> 00:40:58,087
Would it not
be more accurate to say

422
00:40:58,089 --> 00:41:00,557
"destroyed a cassette tape"?

423
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:02,959
I'm sorry. Wasn't the cassette
tape his property?

424
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:05,195
Of course it was. Then it seems
entirely accurate to say

425
00:41:05,197 --> 00:41:06,863
he damaged
the victim's property.

426
00:41:06,865 --> 00:41:08,698
Why be vague?

427
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:11,568
And "damaged" doesn't reflect
its irrevocable condition...

428
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:13,736
Fine. "Damaged property
belonging to the victim."

429
00:41:13,738 --> 00:41:15,205
It was a cassette tape.

430
00:41:15,207 --> 00:41:17,774
That's what it was...
not a teacup, not a chair...

431
00:41:17,776 --> 00:41:19,776
a cassette tape. Yeah.

432
00:41:19,778 --> 00:41:23,480
How about "destroyed
item of personal property"?

433
00:41:23,482 --> 00:41:25,081
All right.

434
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:28,918
We'd suggest "destroyed
item of personal property."

435
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,520
Ms. Wexler?

436
00:41:30,522 --> 00:41:32,722
Works for us.

437
00:41:32,724 --> 00:41:34,691
Shall I change it, or...?

438
00:41:34,693 --> 00:41:35,892
If you would.

439
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:47,871
"Destroyed item
of personal property."

440
00:41:47,873 --> 00:41:49,138
There.

441
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:52,642
Can you initial it, please?

442
00:41:52,644 --> 00:41:55,912
"JMM." Initialed.

443
00:41:57,682 --> 00:42:00,149
Charles, was there anything else
you found wanting

444
00:42:00,151 --> 00:42:03,520
in your brother's statement?

445
00:42:04,656 --> 00:42:05,755
No.

446
00:42:05,757 --> 00:42:07,056
We're satisfied. Thank you.

447
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:12,295
All right. So, we're all set.

448
00:42:12,297 --> 00:42:14,163
No, not all set, Mr. McGill.

449
00:42:14,165 --> 00:42:16,633
Your brother may be satisfied,
but I am not.

450
00:42:17,936 --> 00:42:19,769
The confession you've written
is adequate,

451
00:42:19,771 --> 00:42:23,139
but, frankly, I-I sense
a lack of remorse.

452
00:42:23,141 --> 00:42:26,209
And I, for one, would like
to hear an apology.

453
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:28,945
Charles deserves
at least that much.

454
00:42:30,982 --> 00:42:32,081
Now?

455
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:35,685
Yes, Mr. McGill, now.

456
00:42:37,856 --> 00:42:40,223
Okay.

457
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:42,926
I was wrong.

458
00:42:42,928 --> 00:42:46,829
Mr. McGill, could you at least
look your brother in the eye?

459
00:42:56,207 --> 00:43:02,078
Chuck... I'm very sorry.

460
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,648
I lost my temper,
and I did some things...

461
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:08,985
so many things that I regret.

462
00:43:08,987 --> 00:43:13,623
I shouldn't have
broken down your door.

463
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:16,192
Doesn't matter
how I was provoked.

464
00:43:16,194 --> 00:43:18,995
I-I shouldn't have done that.

465
00:43:18,997 --> 00:43:24,701
There's no excuse for that.
Or for the things that I said.

466
00:43:24,703 --> 00:43:27,670
I regret it all,

467
00:43:27,672 --> 00:43:30,840
all of it more
than you can imagine,

468
00:43:30,842 --> 00:43:33,810
because...

469
00:43:33,812 --> 00:43:35,745
'cause you're my brother,

470
00:43:35,747 --> 00:43:40,283
and no one should treat
his own brother like that.

471
00:43:40,285 --> 00:43:42,251
Not ever.

472
00:43:45,156 --> 00:43:48,324
Okay?

473
00:43:48,326 --> 00:43:50,360
All right, then.

474
00:43:50,362 --> 00:43:52,228
On to the matter of restitution.

475
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:54,197
Mr. McGill,
according to your agreement,

476
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:55,932
you have two weeks
to pay your brother back.

477
00:43:55,934 --> 00:43:58,768
I would like to pay up now,
if I may.

478
00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:00,803
You may.

479
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:03,740
The amount is $321.

480
00:44:03,742 --> 00:44:06,075
Ms. Hay. I'm sorry.

481
00:44:06,077 --> 00:44:08,978
That figure doesn't represent
a full accounting.

482
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,246
No?

483
00:44:10,248 --> 00:44:13,783
I believe the correct amount
is $323.98.

484
00:44:13,785 --> 00:44:16,986
That includes
the cassette tape...

485
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:18,721
which was destroyed.

486
00:44:18,723 --> 00:44:20,223
Good. Thank you.

487
00:44:20,225 --> 00:44:26,129
$323.98,
including the cassette tape.

488
00:44:47,719 --> 00:44:49,252
What do you say
we get you home?

489
00:44:51,423 --> 00:44:53,823
Howard. Chuck.

490
00:44:53,825 --> 00:44:56,726
I'm putting you both on notice
regarding the bar hearing.

491
00:44:56,728 --> 00:44:58,995
The first thing, I'm filing
a motion to suppress that tape.

492
00:44:58,997 --> 00:45:00,997
The tape that Jimmy destroyed,
you mean?

493
00:45:00,999 --> 00:45:03,266
How about we stop
with the games?

494
00:45:03,268 --> 00:45:05,134
There's no way
there isn't a duplicate.

495
00:45:05,136 --> 00:45:06,402
Really?

496
00:45:06,404 --> 00:45:08,071
Of course there is.

497
00:45:08,073 --> 00:45:10,006
You knew
Jimmy was gonna break in.

498
00:45:10,008 --> 00:45:11,407
You<i> wanted</i> him to.

499
00:45:11,409 --> 00:45:13,176
There's no way
you were gonna let him destroy

500
00:45:13,178 --> 00:45:15,078
the only copy of that tape,
so you made a duplicate...

501
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,379
it's the first thing you did.

502
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:19,015
Kim... this is not
how we do discovery.

503
00:45:19,017 --> 00:45:21,150
Actually, Jimmy destroyed
the duplicate.

504
00:45:22,187 --> 00:45:23,252
It's fine, Howard.

505
00:45:24,723 --> 00:45:26,022
The original is under
lock and key,

506
00:45:26,024 --> 00:45:27,724
and in due time,

507
00:45:27,726 --> 00:45:30,193
it will be put into evidence
for your review.

508
00:45:30,195 --> 00:45:32,795
So, of course, file whatever
motions you'd like.

509
00:45:32,797 --> 00:45:33,796
It's your privilege.

510
00:45:33,798 --> 00:45:34,931
I will. Count on it.

511
00:45:34,933 --> 00:45:37,033
But, Kim,
you should be aware...

512
00:45:37,035 --> 00:45:38,735
because I believe this will be

513
00:45:38,737 --> 00:45:40,737
your first
disciplinary hearing...

514
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:43,806
the Bar Association's
standard of proof

515
00:45:43,808 --> 00:45:46,375
is far more lenient
than what you're used to.

516
00:45:46,377 --> 00:45:51,214
Motions aside,
that tape will be played.

517
00:45:51,216 --> 00:45:52,915
Chuck. Yeah.

518
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:54,183
See you, Kim.

519
00:46:16,241 --> 00:46:19,008
Well?

520
00:46:20,478 --> 00:46:22,378
What?

521
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,514
Bingo.
