00:00:27,706 --> 00:00:29,273
Found a phone!

3
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:33,172
It looks like it's from
1967, but I think it'll work.

4
00:00:33,197 --> 00:00:34,859
Just a sec, Jimmy.

5
00:00:35,437 --> 00:00:37,732
Excellent. Thank you
for being so careful.

6
00:00:37,768 --> 00:00:39,134
- Sir.
- Hmm?

7
00:00:39,169 --> 00:00:41,102
- We have to get in your attic.
- For what?

8
00:00:41,138 --> 00:00:42,422
Oh, the hook-up.

9
00:00:42,447 --> 00:00:43,613
Oh, no. That's all right. Don't bother.

10
00:00:43,638 --> 00:00:44,984
Oh, it won't take 20 minutes.

11
00:00:45,009 --> 00:00:46,577
Plus, you really can't
use it if I don't do it.

12
00:00:46,602 --> 00:00:48,368
No, it's all right. We're not gonna...

13
00:00:48,404 --> 00:00:49,770
Uh, when you're done here,

14
00:00:49,805 --> 00:00:51,471
would you get some more
lamps in the garage?

15
00:00:51,507 --> 00:00:52,739
- Thanks.

17
00:00:54,176 --> 00:00:55,609
- So, we got a phone.
- Yeah.

18
00:00:55,644 --> 00:00:56,834
The yard's half-mowed.

19
00:00:56,859 --> 00:00:58,979
Uh, the sockets and
stuff are looking a-ok.

20
00:00:59,014 --> 00:01:01,081
I'm gonna check again just to make sure.

21
00:01:01,116 --> 00:01:02,382
We're almost there.

22
00:01:02,418 --> 00:01:03,450
[Chuckling] Good. Good.

23
00:01:03,485 --> 00:01:05,919
Um, what do you think?

24
00:01:05,955 --> 00:01:08,288
On? Off?

25
00:01:08,324 --> 00:01:11,325
Ohh. I think... off.

26
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,127
Yeah. You're right. Off it is.

27
00:01:14,163 --> 00:01:15,692
- Chuck.
- Hmm?

28
00:01:15,717 --> 00:01:17,465
You sure this is the right play?

29
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:18,799
I mean, in my experience,

30
00:01:18,834 --> 00:01:22,459
the bigger the lie, the
harder it can be to dig out.

31
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,459
I'll cross that bridge
when I come to it.

33
00:01:29,241 --> 00:01:31,078
Hey, guys, think we're
set with the lamps.

34
00:01:31,113 --> 00:01:34,414

hand with this phone? Gracias.

what's with the candles?

49
00:03:09,281 --> 00:03:10,600
Why you sittin' here in the dark?

50
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,179
Ye, I was wondering the same thing.

51
00:03:12,214 --> 00:03:15,489
Oh, my God, the afternoon I've had.

52
00:03:15,514 --> 00:03:17,684
Two hours ago, I take the sea bass out.

53
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:20,387
No sooner is it prepped and resting

54
00:03:20,412 --> 00:03:22,823
then, boom... power goes down.

55
00:03:22,858 --> 00:03:25,121
I get on the phone to the city.

56
00:03:25,146 --> 00:03:26,545
To make a long story short,

57
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:29,763
those bozos at PNM mixed up my payment.

61
00:03:36,071 --> 00:03:38,864
- 215. Mm-hmm. Mm.
- 215, exactly.

62
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:41,007
They say they'll have
it on again by tomorrow.

63
00:03:41,043 --> 00:03:44,444
In the meantime, I borrowed some
camping gear from my neighbors.

64
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,883
Hence, the rustic flair.

65
00:03:46,908 --> 00:03:48,115
- Jeez.
- Oh, yeah.

66
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,549
So, what do we do?

67
00:03:49,585 --> 00:03:51,765
Uh, get out of here
and go to a restaurant?

68
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,380
We could hit Seasons. Your treat.

69
00:03:54,405 --> 00:03:56,703
We could, yeah.

70
00:03:56,728 --> 00:03:59,092
But, um, you know,
dinner's almost ready.

71
00:03:59,128 --> 00:04:01,361
And the fish... I would have
just had to throw it out.

72
00:04:01,396 --> 00:04:03,029
All I have to do is toss it in a pan.

73
00:04:03,065 --> 00:04:04,765
How about we just rough it?

74
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,099

- No, no, Jimmy.

- You don't have to.
- No, least I can do...

- ... is the dishes.

than I thought. [Chuckles]

over Jimmy being a lawyer.

[Breathes deeply]

111
00:05:27,371 --> 00:05:29,010
change things up.

You've got great taste.
And if it ain't broke...

114
00:05:34,354 --> 00:05:35,818
How's the tour going?

115
00:05:35,854 --> 00:05:36,971
It's good. Good.

116
00:05:36,996 --> 00:05:38,796
- Um, the Far East this fall.
- Oh.

117
00:05:38,821 --> 00:05:41,134
Uh, China, South Korea, and Vietnam.

118

- That's gonna be exciting.
- Yeah.

119
00:05:43,031 --> 00:05:45,482
And then, um, after Santa Fe this week,

120
00:05:45,507 --> 00:05:48,349
- uh, we're back to Central Europe.
- And it's good?

121
00:05:48,435 --> 00:05:50,168
- Well, it's a lot of hotels.
- Yeah.

122
00:05:50,214 --> 00:05:52,414
I mean, in Budapest,
I think I saw mostly

123
00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:55,497
the inside of the concert
hall and the Marriott.

124
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:58,186
But, you know, I shouldn't complain.

125
00:05:58,222 --> 00:06:01,216
You're not complaining.
You're observing.

126
00:06:04,561 --> 00:06:06,461
Did you finally get to see Salzburg?

127
00:06:06,497 --> 00:06:09,170
[Breathes deeply] Not yet,
but next month, after Vienna.

128
00:06:09,248 --> 00:06:11,767
Do you remember when we
tried to go to Salzburg?

129
00:06:11,802 --> 00:06:14,202
And that crazy old
lady on the scooter...

130
00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:16,997
- Oh, yes! Yes! [Laughs]
- ... chased us out of the train station.

131
00:06:17,022 --> 00:06:18,686
Yeah! And then, um...

132
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,223
and then we went and got, uh,

133
00:06:20,248 --> 00:06:23,809
it was a-a-a raspberry
Linzer torte in Innsbruck?

134
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:25,575
- Mm.
- To make ourselves feel better?

135
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,783
Mm. [Chuckles] You said,
"We'll never finish this!"

136
00:06:27,818 --> 00:06:28,991
And then we did.

[Both laughing]

138
00:06:32,327 --> 00:06:34,823
So, what's after Asia? Any
plans for a stateside tour?

139
00:06:34,873 --> 00:06:37,272
[Sighs] Oh, you know,
hopefully next year.

140
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:40,128
You know, maybe a residency.
Oh, that would be sweet.

141
00:06:40,164 --> 00:06:41,563
I mean, you know, I like the buses

142
00:06:41,598 --> 00:06:43,655
and trains and planes fine,

143
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,202
but I, um...

144
00:06:45,756 --> 00:06:49,350
I miss having one...
one place to hang my hat.

Oh, God!

148
00:06:57,214 --> 00:06:59,815
I'm sorry. I-I-I hate that thing.

149
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:02,985
I feel like I'm on a leash. Ugh!

150
00:07:03,616 --> 00:07:05,003
I'm sorry.

Oh. Oh, it's my conductor.

153
00:07:10,834 --> 00:07:13,661
Um, I have to take this. I'm sorry.

154
00:07:13,686 --> 00:07:15,163
H-Hi, Andre.

155
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,655
No, I'm just at dinner. What's up?

156
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:19,801
Well, I can do that at rehearsal.

157
00:07:19,837 --> 00:07:21,997
Yeah, no problem. Yeah.

158
00:07:22,022 --> 00:07:25,307
No, I-I know that they're
coming in late on bar 16.

159
00:07:25,342 --> 00:07:27,843
Y-Yeah. Got it. Got it.

160
00:07:27,878 --> 00:07:29,678
I will make sure that...

161
00:07:29,713 --> 00:07:31,513
Uh, c-c-can you hold on a second?

162
00:07:31,548 --> 00:07:33,245
Let me just get a pen.

163
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,699
Mm-hmm.

164
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,629
Yeah. No, I-I...

165
00:07:38,422 --> 00:07:40,455
Yeah, hold on one second.

166
00:07:40,491 --> 00:07:42,557
Yeah, I can do it... I
mean, whatever you need.

167
00:07:42,593 --> 00:07:44,159
Mm-hmm. Okay.

168
00:07:44,194 --> 00:07:45,394
All right, shoot.

Chuck?

173
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:53,402
I'm all right.

174
00:07:53,437 --> 00:07:56,471
Well, do you want me to
rehearse the cellists separately?

175

Otherwise, the defense'll
tear it to shreds.

354
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:43,175
It's already a solid case.

355
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:46,159
We have Jimmy's statement from
the Pre-Prosecution Diversion.

356
00:15:46,184 --> 00:15:48,780
There's my testimony
and the private eye's.

357
00:15:49,347 --> 00:15:52,694
Maybe there's no need to put you
through the wringer like this.

358
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:55,754
This isn't about me or my health.

359
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:57,917
This is about PR.

360
00:15:58,405 --> 00:16:00,405
We lost a client.

361
00:16:00,808 --> 00:16:04,563
That happened because, while
you were... incapacitated,

362
00:16:04,598 --> 00:16:06,120
your brother accessed documents

363
00:16:06,145 --> 00:16:08,941
that should have been secured at HHM.

364
00:16:09,722 --> 00:16:12,792
What Jimmy did is unconscionable, yes...

365
00:16:12,964 --> 00:16:16,541
but one of my jobs is to
safeguard the firm's reputation.

366
00:16:16,577 --> 00:16:19,175
This is not the time to
worry about how we look.

367
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,080
This is about what's
right and what's wrong.

368
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:24,282
I'm not gonna risk Jimmy getting, what?

369
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:27,486
A year's suspension? Maybe two?

370
00:16:27,521 --> 00:16:31,456
He deserves disbarment,
not some slap on the wrist.

371
00:16:31,511 --> 00:16:34,902
No, Howard. There's
only one way forward.

372
00:16:35,796 --> 00:16:39,081
Let justice be done,
though the heavens fall.

373
00:16:39,558 --> 00:16:41,267
[Door creaks open]

374
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:43,802
Sorry to keep you
waiting. This'll do nicely.

375
00:16:44,001 --> 00:16:46,502
Please extend my thanks to the
Committee for their flexibility.

376
00:16:49,618 --> 00:16:52,656
Alley: Good morning. I'm
Robert Alley for the State Bar.

377
00:16:53,392 --> 00:16:55,097
In the matter of James M. McGill,

378
00:16:55,122 --> 00:16:57,706
the State Bar intends to
prove the following violations

379
00:16:57,731 --> 00:16:59,697
of the Ethical Code.

380
00:16:59,743 --> 00:17:02,324
16-102...

381
00:17:02,349 --> 00:17:05,513
engaging in conduct a
lawyer knows is criminal.

382
00:17:05,538 --> 00:17:08,433
Mr. McGill certainly knew that
breaking down his brother's door

383
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,625
was criminal behavior.

384
00:17:10,843 --> 00:17:13,609
16-804...

385
00:17:13,634 --> 00:17:15,913
committing a criminal act
that reflects adversely

386
00:17:15,938 --> 00:17:20,147
on the lawyer's honesty or
trustworthiness as a lawyer.

387
00:17:20,764 --> 00:17:22,286
Any reasonable person would agree

388
00:17:22,321 --> 00:17:24,822
that assaulting another
lawyer in his own home

389
00:17:24,857 --> 00:17:28,460
reflects badly on Mr. McGill's
fitness as an attorney.

390
00:17:29,862 --> 00:17:32,109
16-304...

391
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,698
unlawfully altering, destroying,

392
00:17:34,734 --> 00:17:38,836
or concealing material having
potential evidentiary value.

393
00:17:38,871 --> 00:17:41,038
Mr. McGill broke into his brother's home

394
00:17:41,063 --> 00:17:42,906
and destroyed an audiocassette

395
00:17:42,942 --> 00:17:45,099
which contained a
recording of a conversation

396
00:17:45,124 --> 00:17:48,574
between himself and his
brother, Charles McGill.

397
00:17:48,638 --> 00:17:50,427
We will show that this
recording was evidence

398
00:17:50,452 --> 00:17:52,528
- in an ongoing legal case.
- [Door creaks]

399
00:17:53,586 --> 00:17:54,852
The State Bar believes that,

400
00:17:54,877 --> 00:17:56,887
once we have presented the facts,

401
00:17:56,923 --> 00:17:59,623
the Committee will agree
that disbarment is warranted

402
00:17:59,659 --> 00:18:01,641
for James McGill.

403
00:18:02,273 --> 00:18:04,023
Thank you very much.

404
00:18:04,742 --> 00:18:06,630
Thank you, Mr. Alley.

405
00:18:06,655 --> 00:18:08,320
Ms. Wexler?

406
00:18:13,328 --> 00:18:15,399
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

407
00:18:16,142 --> 00:18:17,570
Good morning.

408
00:18:17,595 --> 00:18:20,133
I'm Kim Wexler, co-counsel
with James McGill,

409
00:18:20,158 --> 00:18:21,412
for the defense.

410
00:18:21,447 --> 00:18:25,045
You've already read Mr. McGill's
Pre-Prosecution Statement.

411
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:28,018
We don't dispute he broke
into his brother's house,

412
00:18:28,054 --> 00:18:30,047
an act he regrets...

413
00:18:30,729 --> 00:18:32,156
deeply.

414
00:18:32,191 --> 00:18:34,758
But there is another side to this story.

415
00:18:34,794 --> 00:18:37,665
One not about calculation...

416
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:40,391
or ill intent,

417
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,033
but about about two brothers,

418
00:18:43,383 --> 00:18:46,813
whose relationship,
after years of strain,

419
00:18:47,348 --> 00:18:48,815
finally broke.

420
00:18:50,836 --> 00:18:53,844
We believe that, after you
have the complete picture,

421
00:18:53,879 --> 00:18:56,617
you'll understand
James McGill is an asset

422
00:18:56,649 --> 00:18:58,413
to our legal community.

423
00:18:58,438 --> 00:19:01,930
And he should remain a full
member of it in good standing.

424
00:19:03,219 --> 00:19:04,867
Thank you.

425
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:08,156
Thank you, Ms. Wexler.

426
00:19:11,836 --> 00:19:15,235
- Okay, if, uh, everyone's ready to...
- [Clock ticking]

427
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,086
begin testimony...

428
00:19:17,485 --> 00:19:19,303
Mr. Alley, call your witness.

429
00:19:19,338 --> 00:19:21,374
Hamlin: Bang! Bang! Bang!

430
00:19:21,399 --> 00:19:22,806
Then he kicked down the door.

431
00:19:22,842 --> 00:19:25,240
Jimmy was very agitated.
He was shouting.

432
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:27,065
He demanded Charles turn over

433
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:29,075
- the evidence he'd been collecting...
- Kim: Objection.

434
00:19:29,122 --> 00:19:32,417
We haven't established the
tape is evidence of anything.

435
00:19:32,442 --> 00:19:34,752
The defense has only acknowledged
it as a piece of property.

436
00:19:34,787 --> 00:19:36,794
Uh, allow me to rephrase.

437
00:19:37,757 --> 00:19:41,091
Jimmy demanded an audiocassette
in Charles' possession,

438
00:19:41,127 --> 00:19:42,526
which Jimmy proceeded,

439
00:19:42,561 --> 00:19:45,362
with the help of an
iron fireplace implement,

440
00:19:45,398 --> 00:19:47,777
to pry from Charles' desk.

441
00:19:47,802 --> 00:19:49,667
He then broke the cassette into pieces

442
00:19:49,692 --> 00:19:51,835
and went on to confront his brother.

443
00:19:51,871 --> 00:19:54,838
What happened after the
defendant smashed this tape?

444
00:19:54,874 --> 00:19:56,273
Mr. Brightbill and I...

445
00:19:56,308 --> 00:19:58,575
That's the private
investigator that Charles hired?

446
00:19:58,611 --> 00:20:00,344
That's correct.

447
00:20:00,379 --> 00:20:04,014
He and I were concerned that
Jimmy might strike his brother.

448
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:06,254
So that's when we stepped in.

449
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:08,085
- Thank you, Mr. Hamlin.
- Certainly.

450
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,700
Nothing further at this time.

451
00:20:09,725 --> 00:20:11,555
Man: Ms. Wexler?

452
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,856
[Papers rustling]

453
00:20:12,892 --> 00:20:14,748
Kim: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

454
00:20:15,995 --> 00:20:17,928
[Clears throat]

455
00:20:17,963 --> 00:20:19,096
[Sniffles]

456
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:26,473
You testified you've known
my client for some time.

457
00:20:26,498 --> 00:20:28,108
How long exactly?

458
00:20:28,133 --> 00:20:30,081
Nearly 10 years.

459
00:20:30,106 --> 00:20:32,098
How did you come to know him?

460
00:20:32,123 --> 00:20:35,045
His brother asked to hire him
in the mail-room at our firm.

461
00:20:35,081 --> 00:20:36,998
- And you did.
- Yes.

462
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,795
What was your opinion of him then?

463
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,975
[Clicks tongue] I thought... [Sighs]

464
00:20:44,295 --> 00:20:46,457
he had a lot of get-up-and-go.

465
00:20:46,492 --> 00:20:47,725
He was a hard worker.

466
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,029
You had a nickname for him, didn't you?

467
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,396
"Charlie Hustle."

468
00:20:52,431 --> 00:20:54,037
"Charlie Hustle."

469
00:20:54,381 --> 00:20:57,000
How'd you feel when you found
out he'd become a lawyer?

470
00:20:57,036 --> 00:20:58,268
Surprised.

471
00:20:58,304 --> 00:21:00,070
He'd put himself through law school

472
00:21:00,106 --> 00:21:02,770
and taken the Bar Exam without
telling any of the partners.

473
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:03,907
Even Charles.

474
00:21:03,943 --> 00:21:06,143
He bootstrapped his
way into a law degree

475
00:21:06,178 --> 00:21:07,945
while working in your mail-room.

476
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,514
Did you consider taking
him on as an associate?

477
00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:11,795
We did.

478
00:21:12,529 --> 00:21:13,684
Briefly.

479
00:21:13,719 --> 00:21:16,210
Sounds like you didn't
hire him. Why not?

480
00:21:16,235 --> 00:21:17,588
With that kind of grit.

481
00:21:17,623 --> 00:21:19,326
The partners decided it would be best

482
00:21:19,351 --> 00:21:21,865
to avoid the appearance of nepotism.

483
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:25,545
We felt hiring Jimmy
might damage morale.

484
00:21:26,298 --> 00:21:27,670
Nepotism.

485
00:21:28,234 --> 00:21:31,268
Your firm is "Hamlin,
Hamlin, and McGill," right?

486
00:21:31,303 --> 00:21:33,035
Who's the other Hamlin?

487
00:21:35,556 --> 00:21:37,027
My father.

488
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:44,908
Which partner was the most
concerned with nepotism?

489
00:21:45,494 --> 00:21:47,158
Charles McGill.

490
00:21:47,586 --> 00:21:50,400
- So Jimmy's own brother blocked him.
- Alley: Objection.

491
00:21:50,425 --> 00:21:53,824
How are the hiring practices of
Hamlin, Hamlin, McGill relevant here?

492
00:21:53,859 --> 00:21:55,459
It's relevant to understand

493
00:21:55,494 --> 00:21:57,694
the relationship between these brothers.

494
00:21:58,988 --> 00:22:01,732
We'll, uh, give you
some leeway, Ms. Wexler,

495
00:22:01,767 --> 00:22:03,500
but don't stray too far.

496
00:22:03,536 --> 00:22:05,869
Charles McGill is not the
subject of this hearing.

497
00:22:05,905 --> 00:22:07,152
Thank you.

498
00:22:08,012 --> 00:22:10,096
Did Jimmy know his brother was the one

499
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:11,809
that prevented you from hiring him?

500
00:22:11,844 --> 00:22:14,344
Hamlin: No. He did not.

501
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:17,648
Eventually, he was hired
by the firm of Davis & Main.

502
00:22:17,683 --> 00:22:20,668
I'd be happy to say more
about that, if you'd like.

503
00:22:21,187 --> 00:22:23,821
No. Thank you.

504
00:22:23,856 --> 00:22:26,549
When Charles' condition appeared,

505
00:22:26,574 --> 00:22:28,058
Jimmy took care of him, didn't he?

506
00:22:28,093 --> 00:22:29,543
I believe so.

507
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:32,554
Jimmy was struggling to
build his solo law practice,

508
00:22:32,579 --> 00:22:34,992
and yet, every single day, without fail,

509
00:22:35,017 --> 00:22:37,992
he brought his brother food, supplies...

510
00:22:38,017 --> 00:22:40,346
even his favorite
newspapers. Isn't that right?

511
00:22:40,371 --> 00:22:41,603
He did.

512
00:22:42,689 --> 00:22:46,056
Could you speak to the terms
of Charles' leave of absence?

513
00:22:46,595 --> 00:22:48,079
You know I can't.

514
00:22:48,104 --> 00:22:51,976
It was an FMLA leave.
Anything more is confidential.

515
00:22:52,001 --> 00:22:53,917
But you can confirm it was
due to mental illness, correct?

516
00:22:53,953 --> 00:22:57,586
Objection! Charles McGill's
mental health isn't at issue.

517
00:22:57,611 --> 00:23:00,219
This is a smear job on the
State Bar's upcoming witness...

518
00:23:00,244 --> 00:23:01,492
nothing more.

519
00:23:01,517 --> 00:23:03,560
This is not a competency
hearing, Ms. Wexler.

520
00:23:03,596 --> 00:23:06,008
Mr. Hamlin is not a [Sighs]
psychiatric professional.

521
00:23:06,033 --> 00:23:07,595
Do you have any questions
that would be more germane

522
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,619
to his experience?

523
00:23:10,169 --> 00:23:11,564
No.

524
00:23:12,169 --> 00:23:13,969
I have nothing further.

525
00:23:14,315 --> 00:23:16,454
The witness is excused.

526
00:23:28,187 --> 00:23:29,887
Alley: At this time,
the State Bar would like

527
00:23:29,912 --> 00:23:32,033
to enter Exhibit Five into evidence.

528
00:23:32,058 --> 00:23:34,124
We ask that Charles
McGill's recording be played.

529
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,792
I'm respectfully renewing my objection.

530
00:23:35,828 --> 00:23:37,561
The probative value
of playing this Exhibit

531
00:23:37,596 --> 00:23:39,229
is outweighed by how prejudicial it is.

532
00:23:39,265 --> 00:23:40,473
All due respect to Ms. Wexler,

533
00:23:40,498 --> 00:23:43,000
but the State Bar feels
this is fundamental to hear.

534
00:23:43,035 --> 00:23:44,301
We don't want to leave any question

535
00:23:44,326 --> 00:23:46,169
as to the intentions of both parties.

536
00:23:46,205 --> 00:23:48,305
Ms. Wexler, we already
ruled this was fair game

537
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,674
when we denied your motion to suppress.

538
00:23:50,709 --> 00:23:54,278
I'll add, the rough-and-tumble
of your client's conduct aside,

539
00:23:54,313 --> 00:23:55,825
we need to know whether one lawyer

540
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:58,325
attempted to tamper
with another's evidence.

541
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,850
[Pen clicks]

542
00:23:59,885 --> 00:24:02,185
[Wheels rumbling softly]

543
00:24:06,033 --> 00:24:08,867
[Rustling]

544
00:24:11,087 --> 00:24:12,259
Come here.

545
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,354
[Clicks]

546
00:24:13,379 --> 00:24:14,531
[Whispering] What are
you still doing here?

547
00:24:14,566 --> 00:24:17,034
- [Whispering] Flight's delayed.
- How delayed?

548
00:24:17,069 --> 00:24:18,869
40 minutes, last I checked.

549
00:24:18,904 --> 00:24:22,172
Shit. Okay. Keep me posted.

550
00:24:22,207 --> 00:24:24,174
- [Woman speaking indistinctly]
- [Sighs]

551
00:24:24,209 --> 00:24:25,642
Alley: Um, yes.

552
00:24:25,693 --> 00:24:27,065
Here we go.

553
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,767
[Buzzing]

554
00:24:30,149 --> 00:24:31,515
Thank you for your patience.

555
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,183
The State Bar is ready to proceed.

556
00:24:33,218 --> 00:24:34,616
[Clears throat] Um, begging your pardon.

557
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:38,928
Um, the defense requests a
moment to review, if we could?

558
00:24:40,526 --> 00:24:41,959
All right. [Sighs]

559
00:24:41,994 --> 00:24:43,660
When you're ready.

560
00:24:43,696 --> 00:24:45,374
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

561
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,204
[Whispering] What are we doing?

562
00:24:54,239 --> 00:24:55,710
[Whispering] We're stalling.

563
00:24:57,609 --> 00:24:59,482
Yes. Yes.

564
00:24:59,507 --> 00:25:02,740
My brother has many admirable qualities.

565
00:25:02,765 --> 00:25:06,874
I-In some ways, I can say I admire him.

566
00:25:07,463 --> 00:25:09,063
Too cold.

567
00:25:10,538 --> 00:25:12,460
I love my brother.

568
00:25:13,192 --> 00:25:16,413
But Ted Kaczynski's
brother loved him, too.

569
00:25:16,438 --> 00:25:18,495
And he wanted to help.

570
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:21,431
That's sanctimonious.

571
00:25:21,467 --> 00:25:23,767
I love my brother.

572
00:25:23,802 --> 00:25:27,108
He's a good person. He has good in him.

573
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:31,085
But the law is too important.

574
00:25:32,877 --> 00:25:34,866
- [Sighs]
- [Clock ticking]

575
00:25:34,891 --> 00:25:35,946
Ah.

576
00:25:35,981 --> 00:25:37,180
[Knock on door]

577
00:25:37,216 --> 00:25:39,178
Be right there, Howard!

578
00:25:41,985 --> 00:25:43,581
[Sighs]

579
00:25:45,157 --> 00:25:48,458
The law is too important.

580
00:25:48,894 --> 00:25:50,293
Hmm...

581
00:25:50,329 --> 00:25:53,777
Jimmy: I sure shit wouldn't
be tellin' ya otherwise.

582
00:25:54,075 --> 00:25:55,652
But, yes...

583
00:25:56,131 --> 00:25:57,676
it's the truth.

584
00:25:58,604 --> 00:26:01,471
Chuck: You'd go to such
lengths to humiliate me?

585
00:26:01,507 --> 00:26:03,940
I did it for Kim!

586
00:26:03,965 --> 00:26:07,066
She worked her butt
off to get Mesa Verde

587
00:26:07,091 --> 00:26:11,199
while you and Howard sat around
sipping scotch and chortling.

588
00:26:11,224 --> 00:26:14,332
Hamlin, Hamlin, McGill...
more like Scrooge and Marley!

589
00:26:14,357 --> 00:26:16,520
Kim deserves Mesa Verde...

590
00:26:16,545 --> 00:26:18,755
not you, not HHM.

591
00:26:18,791 --> 00:26:21,224
She earned it, and she needs it!

592
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,126
I did it to help her,

593
00:26:23,162 --> 00:26:26,630
but I-I honestly didn't think
it would hurt you so bad.

594
00:26:26,665 --> 00:26:29,332
I thought you'd just say,
"Oh, crap, I made a mistake,"

595
00:26:29,368 --> 00:26:31,802
and go on with your life,
like a normal person!

596
00:26:31,837 --> 00:26:32,969
But, oh, no!

597
00:26:33,005 --> 00:26:35,038
Wishful thinking!

598
00:26:37,338 --> 00:26:39,943
So, can I, uh, tell Howard

599
00:26:39,978 --> 00:26:43,143
you're not quitting or
retiring or whatever?

600
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:48,452
And can we take all this
shit down off the walls?

601
00:26:50,622 --> 00:26:53,021
I'm gonna go call Howard.

602
00:26:53,046 --> 00:26:54,546
Jimmy.

603
00:26:54,991 --> 00:26:58,757
You do realize you just
confessed to a felony?

604
00:26:59,112 --> 00:27:00,733
I guess.

605
00:27:01,133 --> 00:27:03,132
But you feel better, right?

606
00:27:04,303 --> 00:27:07,116
Besides, it's your word against mine.

607
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:10,671
[Clicks]

608
00:27:14,338 --> 00:27:16,504
Uh. Um.

609
00:27:18,183 --> 00:27:20,717
All right, uh, Mr. Alley, uh,

610
00:27:20,752 --> 00:27:23,716
we need to make accommodations
for your next witness.

611
00:27:23,741 --> 00:27:25,546
- Is that correct?
- Yes, Mr. Chairman.

612
00:27:25,571 --> 00:27:26,662
All right.

613
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:29,860
For those who don't know,
we need to prepare the room.

614
00:27:29,895 --> 00:27:32,963
Uh, the Clerk is going to
collect your, uh, cellphones,

615
00:27:32,998 --> 00:27:35,499
watches, key fobs...
anything electrical.

616
00:27:35,534 --> 00:27:38,763
If you prefer not to,
please secure your items...

617
00:27:38,788 --> 00:27:40,237
- Thank you.
- ... outside this room.

618
00:27:40,272 --> 00:27:42,172
Thank you for understanding.

619
00:27:42,207 --> 00:27:43,406
Your phone, sir?

620
00:27:43,442 --> 00:27:45,335
I left it in the car.

621
00:27:55,253 --> 00:27:56,720
[Light switches click]

622
00:28:05,095 --> 00:28:07,362
[Footsteps]

623
00:28:07,785 --> 00:28:10,200
[Door opens]

624
00:28:10,703 --> 00:28:12,102
[Door closes]

625
00:28:18,483 --> 00:28:20,149
[Engine shuts off]

626
00:28:25,417 --> 00:28:28,448
[Indistinct conversations]

627
00:28:34,203 --> 00:28:36,092
- Oh. Excuse me.
- Sorry.

628
00:28:36,128 --> 00:28:37,560
- That's yours.
- Thanks.

629
00:28:37,596 --> 00:28:39,763
[Conversations continue]

630
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:53,382
Please raise your right hand.

631
00:28:53,789 --> 00:28:56,713
Do you swear or affirm to tell
the truth, the whole truth,

632
00:28:56,738 --> 00:28:58,304
and nothing but the truth?

633
00:28:58,329 --> 00:28:59,562
I do.

634
00:29:04,374 --> 00:29:05,882
Could you state your name?

635
00:29:05,907 --> 00:29:07,843
Charles L. McGill.

636
00:29:07,878 --> 00:29:11,975
I'm a senior partner at the law
firm of Hamlin, Hamlin, McGill.

637
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,833
Can the court reporter hear me?

638
00:29:13,858 --> 00:29:15,758
Yes, sir. I can hear you fine.

639
00:29:15,783 --> 00:29:17,719
Mr. McGill, I'll try to be brief.

640
00:29:17,754 --> 00:29:19,510
We don't need to dwell on the burglary

641
00:29:19,535 --> 00:29:21,269
or the assault that you suffered.

642
00:29:21,294 --> 00:29:22,827
Thank you. I appreciate that.

643
00:29:22,852 --> 00:29:25,111
Alley: What I would like
to hear about is this tape.

644
00:29:25,136 --> 00:29:26,869
What compelled you to make it?

645
00:29:26,894 --> 00:29:29,938
I had a suspicion my brother
had tampered with documents

646
00:29:29,963 --> 00:29:31,600
in a case I was working on.

647
00:29:31,635 --> 00:29:32,932
And why would he do that?

648
00:29:32,957 --> 00:29:35,123
Doesn't sound particularly brotherly.

649
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:37,698
I believe it was his hope
that the tainted documents

650
00:29:37,723 --> 00:29:40,275
would cause the client
to become disillusioned

651
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:42,077
with my representation

652
00:29:42,112 --> 00:29:44,026
- and return to their previous attorney,
- [Sighs]

653
00:29:44,051 --> 00:29:45,188
Ms. Wexler.

654
00:29:45,213 --> 00:29:48,350
Which, I should note, is
precisely what happened.

655
00:29:48,385 --> 00:29:49,705
Objection.

656
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:52,268
I'm not saying Ms. Wexler
knew what Jimmy was doing

657
00:29:52,293 --> 00:29:53,835
or had any involvement.

658
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:56,041
I'm only stating that it happened.

659
00:29:56,455 --> 00:29:59,409
Did you have any evidence to
support your suspicions about James?

660
00:29:59,434 --> 00:30:01,796
No. My brother,

661
00:30:01,832 --> 00:30:04,471
whatever else can be said
of him, can be quite clever.

662
00:30:04,496 --> 00:30:06,801
Did an excellent job
of covering his tracks.

663
00:30:06,837 --> 00:30:10,159
Objection. The witness has admitted
there's no corroborating evidence

664
00:30:10,184 --> 00:30:12,198
this supposed crime even occurred.

665
00:30:12,223 --> 00:30:14,635
I'd like to hear what he has to say.

666
00:30:15,627 --> 00:30:17,279
We're going to continue.

667
00:30:17,314 --> 00:30:20,979
Uh, we'll extend you the same
latitude on cross, Ms. Wexler.

668
00:30:21,885 --> 00:30:23,682
Go on, Mr. McGill.

669
00:30:23,707 --> 00:30:25,049
Without physical evidence,

670
00:30:25,074 --> 00:30:27,135
I felt that a recorded confession...

671
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,624
if I could get one... was my best bet.

672
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:32,088
On its own, I knew the tape
would be somewhat flimsy,

673
00:30:32,143 --> 00:30:33,409
but it was a start.

674
00:30:33,445 --> 00:30:36,713
A foundation for a more ironclad case.

675
00:30:36,738 --> 00:30:39,197
I suppose that Jimmy must have felt

676
00:30:39,232 --> 00:30:41,250
the tape was decisive
evidence on its own.

677
00:30:41,275 --> 00:30:43,241
Otherwise, he wouldn't have
broken in to destroy it.

678
00:30:43,266 --> 00:30:45,105
Objection. More speculation.

679
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:46,997
How can he know what was
going on in Jimmy's head?

680
00:30:47,022 --> 00:30:50,129
Sustained. We just need to
hear what happened, Mr. McGill.

681
00:30:50,154 --> 00:30:52,362
Chuck: I-I apologize.

682
00:30:52,397 --> 00:30:55,339
I recorded my brother to
build a case against him.

683
00:30:55,364 --> 00:30:56,552
Alley: And at the time,

684
00:30:56,577 --> 00:30:58,768
would you say that you were in
possession of your faculties?

685
00:30:58,803 --> 00:31:00,269
All due respect, but...

686
00:31:00,305 --> 00:31:02,904
but you do sound somewhat
unhinged on the recording.

687
00:31:02,929 --> 00:31:04,307
Yes, I understand that.

688
00:31:04,342 --> 00:31:06,642
But what you heard was theater.

689
00:31:06,678 --> 00:31:08,778
A performance, play-acting.

690
00:31:08,813 --> 00:31:12,176
I exaggerated the symptoms of my disease

691
00:31:12,201 --> 00:31:13,755
to extract the truth.

692
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,952
Can we talk about your
disease for a moment?

693
00:31:15,987 --> 00:31:18,434
I'd like everybody here to
be on the same page about it.

694
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:19,489
Of course.

695
00:31:19,524 --> 00:31:21,958
It is sometimes referred to as EHS,

696
00:31:21,993 --> 00:31:24,293
electromagnetic hypersensitivity.

697
00:31:24,329 --> 00:31:28,164
I describe it as an acute
allergy to electromagnetism.

698
00:31:28,199 --> 00:31:30,708
It's not a common condition, is it?

699
00:31:30,733 --> 00:31:33,069
I know it sounds strange. I do.

700
00:31:33,104 --> 00:31:36,084
But 30 years ago, no one had
heard of peanut allergies.

701
00:31:36,109 --> 00:31:38,141
But you admit that no one...

702
00:31:38,176 --> 00:31:40,740
uh, no doctor... has ever diagnosed you.

703
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:44,701
AIDS was not identified
properly until 1981.

704
00:31:44,726 --> 00:31:47,784
HIV wasn't known as the cause until '83.

705
00:31:47,819 --> 00:31:51,154
These things take time to
unravel, even for doctors.

706
00:31:51,189 --> 00:31:52,586
Would you say that your illness

707
00:31:52,611 --> 00:31:54,624
affects your ability to think clearly?

708
00:31:54,659 --> 00:31:56,592
No. It affects me physically.

709
00:31:56,628 --> 00:32:00,123
It causes me great pain.
However, I'm perfectly lucid.

710
00:32:00,154 --> 00:32:01,431
Thank you.

711
00:32:01,466 --> 00:32:04,867
Mr. McGill, I have only
one more question for you.

712
00:32:06,329 --> 00:32:08,435
Do you hate your brother?

713
00:32:09,707 --> 00:32:11,740
Absolutely not.

714
00:32:12,459 --> 00:32:14,610
I love my brother.

715
00:32:14,646 --> 00:32:17,308
There's nothing malicious in Jimmy.

716
00:32:18,416 --> 00:32:20,738
He has a way of doing the worst things

717
00:32:20,763 --> 00:32:23,486
for reasons that sound almost noble.

718
00:32:25,081 --> 00:32:27,144
But what I know for sure is that the law

719
00:32:27,169 --> 00:32:29,885
is too important to be toyed with.

720
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:32,377
It's mankind's greatest
achievement... the Rule of Law,

721
00:32:32,402 --> 00:32:34,030
the idea that, no matter who you are,

722
00:32:34,065 --> 00:32:36,299
your actions have consequences.

723
00:32:36,334 --> 00:32:37,800
[Sighs]

724
00:32:37,836 --> 00:32:39,902
And the way my brother treats the law...

725
00:32:39,938 --> 00:32:41,309
[Sighs]

726
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:43,206
it breaks my heart.

727
00:32:43,241 --> 00:32:45,926
That's why I did what
I did. Not to hurt him,

728
00:32:45,951 --> 00:32:48,838
but to protect something
that I hold sacred.

729
00:32:48,863 --> 00:32:50,680
Thank you, Mr. McGill.

730
00:32:50,715 --> 00:32:52,615
The State Bar rests.

731
00:32:56,284 --> 00:32:58,560
[Whispering] I think we
need to put on the brakes.

732
00:32:58,585 --> 00:33:00,351
[Sighs]

733
00:33:01,901 --> 00:33:05,308
I'm sorry. My co-counsel and
I need a moment to confer.

734
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:07,997
Please be brief, Counselor.

735
00:33:08,032 --> 00:33:09,699
Yes, of course.

736
00:33:11,273 --> 00:33:12,506
[Sighs]

737
00:33:12,531 --> 00:33:14,220
She'll be here.

738
00:33:14,939 --> 00:33:17,121
Do you have anything for cross?

739
00:33:17,146 --> 00:33:19,427
- Uh, can I look at your notes?
- [Door creaks open]

740
00:33:19,452 --> 00:33:20,793
Yeah, of course.

741
00:33:20,818 --> 00:33:22,044
Can we, um...

742
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,880
- [Whispering indistinctly]
- Yeah.

743
00:33:25,711 --> 00:33:27,377
[Door creaks]

744
00:33:34,158 --> 00:33:35,424
- Hey.
- Hey.

745
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,959
So glad you made it.

746
00:33:36,995 --> 00:33:39,954
[Indistinct whispering]

747
00:33:40,236 --> 00:33:42,365
Mr. Chairman, I'm sorry.

748
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,135
Um, might I have a moment,
uh, to get a breath?

749
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:48,237
Oh, of course, Mr. McGill.

750
00:33:48,273 --> 00:33:51,140
Uh, folks, let's call this 15.

751
00:33:51,175 --> 00:33:55,311
Everybody, please be back
and ready to go on the hour.

752
00:33:55,346 --> 00:33:56,964
[Indistinct conversations]

753
00:33:58,282 --> 00:33:59,948
[Door creaks]

754
00:34:03,094 --> 00:34:05,391
- Rebecca.
- Chuck.

755
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:06,956
It's good to see you.

756
00:34:06,991 --> 00:34:09,959
I have to say, I'm a bit surprised.

757
00:34:09,994 --> 00:34:11,761
Did Jimmy subpoena you?

758
00:34:11,786 --> 00:34:14,483
You're not on the witness
list. You don't have to testify.

759
00:34:14,508 --> 00:34:16,566
No, no, no, no. I'm not here for that.

760
00:34:16,601 --> 00:34:18,594
Well, what, then?

761
00:34:18,937 --> 00:34:21,453
Chuck, I wish you'd told me.

762
00:34:21,969 --> 00:34:25,241
I-I can't believe what
you've been going through.

763
00:34:25,276 --> 00:34:26,909
How long has it been?

764
00:34:26,945 --> 00:34:28,326
Ah.

765
00:34:28,351 --> 00:34:30,012
You're here to help.

766
00:34:30,048 --> 00:34:32,348
Because all this is so stressful for me.

767
00:34:32,383 --> 00:34:33,449
[Sighs]

768
00:34:33,484 --> 00:34:35,076
Is that what Jimmy told you?

769
00:34:35,101 --> 00:34:36,452
- He's worried about you, Chuck.
- [Scoffs]

770
00:34:36,487 --> 00:34:38,754
In spite of everything that's
happened between the two of you,

771
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:39,822
he... he cares.

772
00:34:39,857 --> 00:34:41,023
What exactly did he say?

773
00:34:41,059 --> 00:34:43,426
Um, well, that you had been sick.

774
00:34:43,461 --> 00:34:45,259
Allergic to electricity?

775
00:34:45,284 --> 00:34:47,196
He sent me pictures of the house.

776
00:34:47,231 --> 00:34:49,456
- Chuck, my God.
- [Sighs]

777
00:34:50,134 --> 00:34:52,101
Why didn't you tell me?

778
00:34:52,136 --> 00:34:54,170
I didn't want to upset you.

779
00:34:54,205 --> 00:34:56,205
Worry you unnecessarily.

780
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,940
[Breathes deeply]

781
00:34:57,976 --> 00:34:59,875
But now you're here.

782
00:34:59,911 --> 00:35:01,677
And now you know.

783
00:35:04,148 --> 00:35:06,550
I came because I thought
it was the right thing.

784
00:35:06,575 --> 00:35:09,352
I thought... I don't know...
that you'd want me to.

785
00:35:09,387 --> 00:35:12,988
But I guess that I'm
more of a distraction.

786
00:35:13,013 --> 00:35:14,357
- So, uh...
- [Sighs]

787
00:35:14,392 --> 00:35:16,392
I'm gonna be in town for a few days,

788
00:35:16,427 --> 00:35:19,695
and I would love to
spend some time with you.

789
00:35:19,731 --> 00:35:21,667
But right now, I-I think I should go.

790
00:35:21,714 --> 00:35:23,699
No. No, no, please. I want you to stay.

791
00:35:23,735 --> 00:35:25,635
Really? You don't seem happy to see me.

792
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:27,203
I am. [Chuckles]

793
00:35:27,238 --> 00:35:29,841
Just surprised, that's all.

794
00:35:30,216 --> 00:35:32,575
Please, stay.

795
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:33,802
Are you sure?

796
00:35:33,827 --> 00:35:35,521
Yes, I'm sure.

797
00:35:35,546 --> 00:35:38,314
You've been sold a
bill of goods, Rebecca.

798
00:35:38,771 --> 00:35:41,091
I want you to see what's what.

799
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:47,223
[Crunching]

800
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:52,341
She's not what I expected.

801
00:35:53,598 --> 00:35:55,931
Oh, yeah? What'd you expect?

802
00:35:55,967 --> 00:35:57,786
I don't know. Just...

803
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,879
not her. [Chuckles]

804
00:35:59,904 --> 00:36:01,848
[Crunching]

805
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:06,645
You know, she's gonna
hate you when this is over.

806
00:36:08,092 --> 00:36:09,427
Yep.

807
00:36:20,939 --> 00:36:22,598
All right, uh, Mr. McGill,

808
00:36:22,634 --> 00:36:24,461
I'll remind you you're still under oath.

809
00:36:24,486 --> 00:36:25,769
I understand.

810
00:36:25,804 --> 00:36:28,442
At this time, I'd like to
turn cross-examination over

811
00:36:28,467 --> 00:36:30,634
to my co-counsel, James McGill.

812
00:36:34,798 --> 00:36:36,290
[Clears throat]

813
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:39,515
Uh, well, there's been
a lot of fuss about it,

814
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:42,641
but you and I have never really
talked about this tape you made.

815
00:36:42,676 --> 00:36:44,142
We lost the opportunity

816
00:36:44,178 --> 00:36:46,790
when you burglarized
my house to destroy it.

817
00:36:46,815 --> 00:36:48,086
Fair enough.

818
00:36:48,111 --> 00:36:49,948
Um, and I was in the wrong there.

819
00:36:49,983 --> 00:36:53,285
But, still, I'd like to
try and follow your story

820
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,840
of why and how you recorded it.

821
00:36:55,865 --> 00:36:58,123
Oh, is this where you
claim the tape is spurious?

822
00:36:58,158 --> 00:36:59,891
That it's not really your voice?

823
00:36:59,927 --> 00:37:02,216
No. That's me on the tape.

824
00:37:02,763 --> 00:37:05,138
But, still, I have some
questions. Like, the recorder,

825
00:37:05,163 --> 00:37:08,591
it must've hurt like hell
for you to touch that.

826
00:37:09,091 --> 00:37:11,470
There was a degree of
discomfort, that's true.

827
00:37:11,505 --> 00:37:12,838
And where did you hide it?

828
00:37:12,873 --> 00:37:14,473
I mean, the sound's pretty clear,

829
00:37:14,508 --> 00:37:16,624
so it wasn't in the
couch cushions, was it?

830
00:37:16,649 --> 00:37:19,177
Tucked under a space
blanket. Out of sight.

831
00:37:19,213 --> 00:37:20,512
Wow.

832
00:37:20,547 --> 00:37:22,247
So there's no chance I would see it.

833
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:23,548
Not with the state your place was in.

834
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:25,484
- Isn't that right?
- I suppose.

835
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:28,290
Would you like to set the scene
for the Disciplinary Committee?

836
00:37:28,315 --> 00:37:30,249
Tell them, you know, what
your house looked like

837
00:37:30,274 --> 00:37:31,700
at the time of the recording.

838
00:37:31,725 --> 00:37:34,159
Objection. Relevance?

839
00:37:34,194 --> 00:37:37,696
Well, the circumstances of the
recording are materially relevant.

840
00:37:37,731 --> 00:37:39,431
How can you know what
the tape really means

841
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:41,867
unless you know what was
going on when it was recorded?

842
00:37:41,902 --> 00:37:44,416
Overruled. The witness
can answer the question.

843
00:37:44,441 --> 00:37:48,673
I covered most of the walls
with Foil-Scrim-Kraft insulation.

844
00:37:48,709 --> 00:37:51,714
I also hung a number of space blankets.

845
00:37:52,371 --> 00:37:54,361
Compact Mylar sheets.

846
00:37:54,386 --> 00:37:55,614
They insulate and protect

847
00:37:55,649 --> 00:37:58,652
against mild electromagnetic radiation.

848
00:37:59,052 --> 00:38:02,900
[Sighs] All right, so, shiny
insulation and space blankets

849
00:38:02,925 --> 00:38:04,756
all over the walls and the ceiling.

850
00:38:04,792 --> 00:38:07,292
[Chuckling] It was like
being inside of a disco ball.

851
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:09,253
Do you have a point?

852
00:38:10,003 --> 00:38:12,597
Well, um, I'm impressed

853
00:38:12,633 --> 00:38:15,100
by how much work went
into entrapping me.

854
00:38:15,135 --> 00:38:16,201
You went all out.

855
00:38:16,236 --> 00:38:17,944
I didn't entrap you.

856
00:38:17,969 --> 00:38:20,705
I provoked an admission
in adverse interest.

857
00:38:20,741 --> 00:38:22,474
That's not the same thing.

858
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:26,945
How did you know it would work?

859
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,380
What do you mean?

860
00:38:28,415 --> 00:38:31,383
How did you know your
"provocation" would work?

861
00:38:31,408 --> 00:38:33,985
Why'd you think a bunch of shiny plastic

862
00:38:34,021 --> 00:38:36,163
would make me say anything?

863
00:38:36,608 --> 00:38:40,216
Isn't it because you knew
that it was precisely the thing

864
00:38:40,241 --> 00:38:41,593
that would worry me so much

865
00:38:41,628 --> 00:38:43,795
that I'd say anything to talk you down?

866
00:38:43,831 --> 00:38:46,565
- Objection.
- Okay. Withdrawn.

867
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,634
Let's... let's get back to your house,

868
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:52,755
every surface covered in tinfoil.

869
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,739
Nothing crazy about that, huh?

870
00:38:54,764 --> 00:38:56,280
As I've said,

871
00:38:56,305 --> 00:38:59,667
I was playing up my condition.

872
00:38:59,713 --> 00:39:01,513
Usually, it's a perfectly normal house.

873
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:03,081
You think your house is normal?

874
00:39:03,116 --> 00:39:06,096
Can I call your
attention to Exhibit Nine?

875
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:12,357
This is your house, right?

876
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:13,692
Yes.

877
00:39:13,727 --> 00:39:16,190
So, exposed wires.

878
00:39:16,307 --> 00:39:17,796
[Pages turning]

879
00:39:17,831 --> 00:39:20,370
There's a camp stove.

880
00:39:20,701 --> 00:39:23,935
There's a lantern on top of newspapers.

881
00:39:23,971 --> 00:39:25,203
You call this normal?

882
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:27,606
I call them adaptations.

883
00:39:27,641 --> 00:39:31,042
A prophylactic measure for a
physical, medical condition.

884
00:39:31,078 --> 00:39:33,323
Did the doctor who granted
me guardianship for you

885
00:39:33,348 --> 00:39:35,963
- think this was a physical condition?
- Objection.

886
00:39:35,988 --> 00:39:38,243
You can't introduce a TEG as evidence.

887
00:39:38,268 --> 00:39:40,034
Besides which, the
panel has already ruled

888
00:39:40,059 --> 00:39:42,693
that Mr. McGill's mental
health is not at issue.

889
00:39:42,718 --> 00:39:45,367
No, the State Bar opened
the door to this on direct

890
00:39:45,392 --> 00:39:48,493
when the witness talked about
his supposed "play-acting."

891
00:39:48,529 --> 00:39:51,563
Allowing me to follow up
on cross is only reasonable.

892
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:53,198
We discussed the physical allergy,

893
00:39:53,233 --> 00:39:54,299
not a mental disability.

894
00:39:54,334 --> 00:39:55,500
Potato, po-tah-to.

895
00:39:55,536 --> 00:39:57,389
It comes down to this...

896
00:39:57,414 --> 00:39:59,838
In order to understand
what I was thinking,

897
00:39:59,873 --> 00:40:02,266
you need to see Chuck through my eyes.

898
00:40:02,291 --> 00:40:06,144
You need to know if I believed
that tape was evidence.

899
00:40:06,179 --> 00:40:08,430
And I say it was evidence
of only one thing...

900
00:40:08,493 --> 00:40:11,149
My brother hates me.

901
00:40:11,184 --> 00:40:15,220
Now, he claims that he lied to
me to get me to tell the truth.

902
00:40:15,255 --> 00:40:16,655
And I'm telling you

903
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:19,424
I lied to my brother
to make him feel better.

904
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:21,058
Which of us you believe

905
00:40:21,083 --> 00:40:25,051
depends on how we all understand
the mind of Charles McGill.

906
00:40:27,019 --> 00:40:31,097
Well, we did promise
the defense some leeway.

907
00:40:31,122 --> 00:40:32,588
You may proceed.

908
00:40:32,613 --> 00:40:35,418
- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
- But watch yourself.

909
00:40:42,429 --> 00:40:44,616
Chuck, I'd like to go
back a little further,

910
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:47,052
talk about when these
symptoms first started.

911
00:40:47,087 --> 00:40:50,905
It was shortly after you
were divorced, is that right?

912
00:40:52,663 --> 00:40:54,192
Yes.

913
00:40:54,227 --> 00:40:56,795
You think the stress of the
divorce brought on the illness?

914
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:59,247
I doubt it. It was an amicable split.

915
00:40:59,272 --> 00:41:01,577
My ex-wife and I are
still on good terms.

916
00:41:01,602 --> 00:41:05,070
In fact, your ex-wife is present
with us today, is she not?

917
00:41:05,105 --> 00:41:06,805
When was the last time
you two saw each other?

918
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,083
Objection. This is not family court.

919
00:41:09,108 --> 00:41:11,599
We're not here to re-litigate
the witness' divorce.

920
00:41:11,624 --> 00:41:13,278
I can't see what purpose this serves.

921
00:41:13,313 --> 00:41:14,980
I can.

922
00:41:15,015 --> 00:41:18,383
I'll tell you why my brother
brought my ex-wife to this hearing.

923
00:41:18,425 --> 00:41:20,822
4,000 miles she came,

924
00:41:20,847 --> 00:41:23,540
lured by concern for me.

925
00:41:23,946 --> 00:41:26,884
What Jimmy's driving at
is the last time I saw her,

926
00:41:26,909 --> 00:41:28,585
I covered up my illness.

927
00:41:28,629 --> 00:41:31,096
I'd been suffering
from it for some time,

928
00:41:31,131 --> 00:41:34,466
but I went to great lengths
to conceal that fact from her.

929
00:41:36,203 --> 00:41:38,852
I'm sorry I deceived you, Rebecca.

930
00:41:39,806 --> 00:41:41,072
[Sighs]

931
00:41:41,108 --> 00:41:44,165
I didn't want you to think less of me.

932
00:41:45,979 --> 00:41:48,656
Now Jimmy has outed me in front of you.

933
00:41:48,681 --> 00:41:50,515
You know why?

934
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:52,273
To rattle me.

935
00:41:52,298 --> 00:41:54,554
He knows I still have a...

936
00:41:54,579 --> 00:41:58,289
[Voice breaking] a lot
of, feeling for my ex-wife.

937
00:41:58,325 --> 00:42:01,159
He's hoping this will break me down.

938
00:42:01,194 --> 00:42:02,540
Split me apart at the seams,

939
00:42:02,565 --> 00:42:06,095
like a murderer confessing on
an episode of "Perry Mason."

940
00:42:07,234 --> 00:42:10,669
Well, I'm sorry to
disappoint you, Jimmy.

941
00:42:12,506 --> 00:42:16,607
Have I answered your
questions to your satisfaction?

942
00:42:16,919 --> 00:42:19,247
Do you have anything else?

943
00:42:20,814 --> 00:42:22,646
Yeah, I do.

944
00:42:23,052 --> 00:42:25,483
Earlier, you talked
about other diseases.

945
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:27,388
Physical conditions, you said.

946
00:42:27,413 --> 00:42:30,522
Uh, so, okay, if you'd
had, um... I don't know...

947
00:42:30,557 --> 00:42:34,677
lung cancer, would you
have told Rebecca then?

948
00:42:34,861 --> 00:42:36,253
[Sighs]

949
00:42:36,278 --> 00:42:39,330
If that had been the
case, maybe. I might have.

950
00:42:39,366 --> 00:42:42,834
- So how is this different?
- Mr. McGill. Move it along.

951
00:42:42,869 --> 00:42:44,139
You don't have to answer that.

952
00:42:44,164 --> 00:42:45,553
I want to get down to brass tacks.

953
00:42:45,578 --> 00:42:47,972
I want to be very, very specific here.

954
00:42:48,008 --> 00:42:50,582
This illness, what does it feel like?

955
00:42:50,607 --> 00:42:52,310
You mentioned it's painful.

956
00:42:52,345 --> 00:42:53,521
It is.

957
00:42:53,546 --> 00:42:55,764
[Breathes sharply] There's
a tightness in my chest,

958
00:42:55,789 --> 00:42:57,426
difficulty breathing,

959
00:42:57,451 --> 00:43:00,318
and pain, burning pain.

960
00:43:00,353 --> 00:43:02,487
The pain spreads everywhere.

961
00:43:02,522 --> 00:43:04,818
Sounds horrible. Does it hurt right now?

962
00:43:04,843 --> 00:43:07,942
There's always some discomfort, yes.

963
00:43:07,967 --> 00:43:10,332
Electricity is everywhere
in the modern world.

964
00:43:10,357 --> 00:43:11,663
[Sighs]

965
00:43:11,698 --> 00:43:14,933
But I very much appreciate
the indulgence of the panel

966
00:43:14,968 --> 00:43:16,998
for their accommodation here today.

967
00:43:17,023 --> 00:43:19,123
I can handle this fine.

968
00:43:21,318 --> 00:43:22,607
[Sighs]

969
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:25,396
Right, so, with the lights
out, you don't feel them?

970
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,239
Chuck: If the current's not flowing, no.

971
00:43:27,264 --> 00:43:29,180
- [Door creaks]
- Oh. Sorry about the exit signs.

972
00:43:29,216 --> 00:43:31,278
I guess they couldn't
kill those for you.

973
00:43:31,303 --> 00:43:33,418
Well, they're not drawing much
current, and they're far away.

974
00:43:33,453 --> 00:43:34,719
[Door creaks]

975
00:43:34,755 --> 00:43:36,888
Intensity drops off with distance,

976
00:43:36,923 --> 00:43:38,456
per the inverse-square law.

977
00:43:38,492 --> 00:43:39,758
[Chuckling] Okay, whoa!

978
00:43:39,793 --> 00:43:41,232
Inverse-square... I'm not a physicist.

979
00:43:41,257 --> 00:43:43,628
Could you dumb that down a shade for me?

980
00:43:43,663 --> 00:43:45,014
The farther away it is,

981
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:47,876
the stronger the source
needs to be to have an effect.

982
00:43:47,901 --> 00:43:49,201
Got it. Got it.

983
00:43:49,248 --> 00:43:52,137
So, if I had a small battery,
say, from a watch or something,

984
00:43:52,172 --> 00:43:54,936
and I got it close to you,
close to your skin, you'd know?

985
00:43:54,961 --> 00:43:56,542
I would feel it, yes.

986
00:43:56,576 --> 00:43:57,631
Can you feel more current

987
00:43:57,656 --> 00:44:00,246
coming from any particular
direction right now?

988
00:44:00,271 --> 00:44:01,780
Uh, from that back wall

989
00:44:01,815 --> 00:44:04,315
or, uh, from over there

990
00:44:04,351 --> 00:44:05,950
or up through the floor?

991
00:44:05,986 --> 00:44:08,419
Can you tell us where
the nearest source is

992
00:44:08,455 --> 00:44:09,954
right now?

993
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,642
Jimmy, do you have
something in your pocket?

994
00:44:18,384 --> 00:44:21,415
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact.

995
00:44:24,673 --> 00:44:26,273
My cellphone.

996
00:44:26,298 --> 00:44:30,074
From this distance, you should
feel it, and you don't, do you?

997
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:34,089
Mr. McGill, you were warned to
leave your electronics outside.

998
00:44:34,114 --> 00:44:35,814
It's all right.

999
00:44:35,849 --> 00:44:37,447
It's all right.

1000
00:44:38,164 --> 00:44:39,673
May I?

1001
00:44:41,247 --> 00:44:42,572
Ah.

1002
00:44:45,292 --> 00:44:47,057
Just as I thought.

1003
00:44:47,082 --> 00:44:48,760
There's no battery in here.

1004
00:44:48,795 --> 00:44:50,595
You removed the battery.

1005
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:52,025
[Cellphone clicks]

1006
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:55,366
[Chuckling] That's a sorry
little trick, isn't it?

1007
00:44:55,402 --> 00:44:58,523
Yeah, you got me, Chuck. Dead to rights.

1008
00:44:58,548 --> 00:45:00,772
- [Sighs]
- I removed the battery.

1009
00:45:00,807 --> 00:45:02,941
- Objection.
- Sustained.

1010
00:45:02,976 --> 00:45:05,009
Y-You've taken all the leeway
you're getting, Mr. McGill.

1011
00:45:05,045 --> 00:45:06,728
Wrap it up fast.

1012
00:45:07,103 --> 00:45:08,798
God, Jimmy.

1013
00:45:09,238 --> 00:45:11,726
[Sighs] Don't you know
by now this is real?

1014
00:45:11,751 --> 00:45:12,984
I feel this.

1015
00:45:13,019 --> 00:45:15,286
It's a physical response to stimuli.

1016
00:45:15,322 --> 00:45:17,486
It's not a quirk.

1017
00:45:17,891 --> 00:45:19,189
[Sighs]

1018
00:45:19,214 --> 00:45:21,726
What do I have to do to prove it to you?

1019
00:45:22,253 --> 00:45:23,786
I don't know, Chuck.

1020
00:45:24,376 --> 00:45:26,158
Could you reach into your breast pocket

1021
00:45:26,183 --> 00:45:28,233
and tell me what's there?

1022
00:45:28,268 --> 00:45:29,640
[Scoffs]

1023
00:45:29,665 --> 00:45:31,111
What now?

1024
00:45:37,759 --> 00:45:40,244
Can you tell the court what that was?

1025
00:45:42,415 --> 00:45:44,215
- A battery.
- Mr. Chairman, please.

1026
00:45:44,251 --> 00:45:45,850
Do you recognize that man in back?

1027
00:45:45,886 --> 00:45:48,553
His name is Huell Babineaux.
He's on our witness list.

1028
00:45:48,588 --> 00:45:50,275
You bumped into him in the stairway.

1029
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:53,535
He'll testify he planted this
fully charged battery on you

1030
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:55,159
over an hour and a half ago.

1031
00:45:55,195 --> 00:45:56,594
Hour and 43 minutes ago.

1032
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:59,731
An hour and 43 minutes.
Thank you, Mr. Babineaux.

1033
00:45:59,756 --> 00:46:01,531
And you felt nothing.

1034
00:46:01,556 --> 00:46:02,567
- [Cellphone beeps]
- No, no, no.

1035
00:46:02,602 --> 00:46:04,805
- No, no. It's a trick. It has to...
- Enough is enough.

1036
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:08,072
I submit that Mr. McGill's
mental illness is a non-issue.

1037
00:46:08,108 --> 00:46:09,320
- If he were schizophrenic...
- Schizo...

1038
00:46:09,345 --> 00:46:10,602
... it wouldn't take
away from the fact...

1039
00:46:10,627 --> 00:46:12,334
- ... that the defendant...
- I am not crazy!

1040
00:46:16,249 --> 00:46:18,182
[Chuckling] I am not crazy.

1041
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:20,896
I know he swapped those numbers.

1042
00:46:20,921 --> 00:46:23,187
I knew it was 1216.

1043
00:46:23,223 --> 00:46:24,589
One after Magna Carta.

1044
00:46:24,624 --> 00:46:26,350
As if I could ever make such a mistake.

1045
00:46:26,375 --> 00:46:28,026
Never. Never!

1046
00:46:28,061 --> 00:46:30,608
I just... I just couldn't prove it.

1047
00:46:30,633 --> 00:46:32,147
H-H-He covered his tracks.

1048
00:46:32,172 --> 00:46:34,809
He got that idiot at the
copy shop to lie for him.

1049
00:46:34,844 --> 00:46:36,655
Alley: Mr. McGill, please.
You don't have to go in...

1050
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:37,928
You think this is something?

1051
00:46:37,953 --> 00:46:40,872
You think this is bad,
this... this chicanery?

1052
00:46:40,907 --> 00:46:43,608
He's done worse. That billboard!

1053
00:46:43,643 --> 00:46:46,644
Are you telling me that a man
just happens to fall like that?

1054
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,608
No. He orchestrated it!

1055
00:46:48,633 --> 00:46:50,006
Jimmy!

1056
00:46:50,803 --> 00:46:54,185
He defecated through a sunroof!

1057
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:57,155
[Chuckling] And I saved
him, and I shouldn't have.

1058
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:59,529
I took him into my own firm.

1059
00:46:59,554 --> 00:47:01,759
What was I thinking?!

1060
00:47:01,795 --> 00:47:03,661
He'll never change.

1061
00:47:03,697 --> 00:47:05,063
He'll<i> never</i> change.

1062
00:47:05,098 --> 00:47:07,632
Ever since he was 9, always the same.

1063
00:47:07,667 --> 00:47:10,435
Couldn't keep his hands
out of the cash drawer.

1064
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:12,136
But not our Jimmy.

1065
00:47:12,172 --> 00:47:14,572
Couldn't be precious Jimmy!

1066
00:47:14,607 --> 00:47:16,819
Stealing them blind.

1067
00:47:16,844 --> 00:47:18,977
And he gets to be a lawyer?!

1068
00:47:19,012 --> 00:47:21,145
What a sick joke!

1069
00:47:21,181 --> 00:47:23,982
[Voice breaking] I should have
stopped him when I had the chance!

1070
00:47:24,017 --> 00:47:25,783
And you... you have to stop him!

1071
00:47:25,819 --> 00:47:27,318
You...

1072
00:47:46,552 --> 00:47:48,802
[Breathes deeply]

1073
00:47:49,509 --> 00:47:51,255
I apologize.

1074
00:47:53,522 --> 00:47:55,989
I lost my train of thought.

1075
00:47:59,066 --> 00:48:01,299
[Sighs] I got carried away.

1076
00:48:04,191 --> 00:48:05,791
[Clears throat]

1077
00:48:06,849 --> 00:48:08,582
Do you have anything else?

1078
00:48:10,931 --> 00:48:12,432
No.

1079
00:48:12,457 --> 00:48:14,189
Nothing further.

1080
00:48:18,601 --> 00:48:20,439
[Sighs]

1081
00:48:22,275 --> 00:48:25,243
[Electricity humming loudly]

1082
