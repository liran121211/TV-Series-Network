1
00:01:34,462 --> 00:01:36,528
You can move
the red five up.

2
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,530
Yeah.

3
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:40,399
Thank you, sir.

4
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:44,503
Why do the cards
have holes in them?

5
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:48,540
They're... These are
used cards from the casino.

6
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:51,376
Once the casino pulls
a deck of cards out of action,

7
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:54,780
they drill a hole through them
and sell 'em to the public.

8
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:56,715
Just a buck or 2.

9
00:01:58,219 --> 00:01:59,485
Look at that.

10
00:02:01,222 --> 00:02:04,556
I suppose that's to prevent
people from cheating with them.

11
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:05,858
Yeah.

12
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,227
Makes for a good souvenir.

13
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,862
These are from Caesars.

14
00:02:09,864 --> 00:02:12,564
I've never been.

15
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:21,640
Getting dark.

16
00:02:23,244 --> 00:02:24,643
I hate to say it,

17
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,912
but I think it might be time
to kill the lights.

18
00:02:26,914 --> 00:02:29,195
Yes, sir. Of course.

19
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:33,252
You sure I can't make you
a cup of tea?

20
00:02:33,254 --> 00:02:35,587
I'm fine, sir. Thank you.

21
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:37,709
All right, then.

22
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:16,255
Just what I needed.

23
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:20,259
Drink up, guys.
Don't need you fallin' asleep.

24
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:22,995
Hey, you take care
of that battery?

25
00:04:22,997 --> 00:04:24,863
Yeah.
It finally shit the bed,

26
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:28,267
but we swapped it out
a couple hours ago.

27
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,903
Okay. How'd it go?

28
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:33,372
No problem.

29
00:04:33,374 --> 00:04:36,294
Anyone see you? Nah.
Dead over there.

30
00:04:38,646 --> 00:04:41,346
A'ight.

31
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:42,914
Stay awake.

32
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:31,182
Hello?

33
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:33,184
Hey. Come on in.

34
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:35,854
Hi. I'm
Francesca Liddy.

35
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:37,188
I'm here for the interview.

36
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,357
Jimmy McGill.

37
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:41,893
Hey, are you, running early,
or am I running late?

38
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:43,495
No, sorry. I'm a little early.

39
00:12:43,497 --> 00:12:44,896
It's not a problem.

40
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:46,397
Never bad to be early...

41
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,834
except in death and taxes
and... some other things.

42
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:52,837
Hey, can I ask you a question?

43
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:54,205
Sure.

44
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:57,408
Does that look straight to you?

45
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:01,846
I think there...
that... that side...

46
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:04,549
I think
you're a little crooked...

47
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:06,911
the bottom of the "M" there.

48
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:12,290
Yeah. A little crooked.

49
00:13:15,061 --> 00:13:17,562
So, you're coming off
of seven years at the MVD?

50
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:19,030
I am, yeah.

51
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:20,532
Here's a question...
how come New Mexico

52
00:13:20,534 --> 00:13:23,268
doesn't call it the DMV
like every other state?

53
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,103
Well, that's a great question.

54
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:26,838
Just like in Arizona,

55
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,508
the Motor Vehicles Division
is part of the DOT, a division,

56
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,278
whereas,
in most other states, the DMV,

57
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,548
or Department of Motor Vehicles
is its own entity, so...

58
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,583
I don't know
if that answers the question,

59
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:40,885
except to say
that's the government for you.

60
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:42,821
You got that right.

61
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:45,423
Well, I, for one,
am not calling it the MVD...

62
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:46,925
DMV all the way.

63
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:50,461
What do you think you learned
the most working there?

64
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,130
Patience, diplomacy.

65
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:55,466
You meet a-all sorts
of people down there,

66
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:57,268
a-and most are really great,
really friendly,

67
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:00,305
but you encounter some
who are upset, belligerent.

68
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:01,573
What about old folks?

69
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:02,975
You get
your fair share of them?

70
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:04,876
Lots of elderly drivers.

71
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:07,445
After 75, they need
to take their test again,

72
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:09,113
so if they don't pass,

73
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:10,348
you have to explain to them

74
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,583
why their license
isn't being renewed,

75
00:14:11,585 --> 00:14:12,984
which is hard for them.

76
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:14,285
What do you say then?

77
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:15,887
Do you ever... yell at them?

78
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:17,121
I mean, geezers, right?

79
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:19,257
How can you not?

80
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:21,392
No, I would never.

81
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:23,094
No.

82
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:24,629
Nor should you.
That was a trick question.

83
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:26,965
You passed with flying colors
...very good.

84
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:28,967
Okay.

85
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:33,271
Well, then, so, Jimmy and I
have very different needs.

86
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:37,308
His practice is mostly wills
for senior citizens,

87
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:40,111
while I'm focused on
a single client at the moment,

88
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:42,013
Mesa Verde,
with banking regulations

89
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:43,615
that generate
a ton of paperwork,

90
00:14:43,617 --> 00:14:45,984
so I'm looking for someone

91
00:14:45,986 --> 00:14:47,952
with an eye for organization
and detail.

92
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:49,320
Well,
DMV's great for that...

93
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:51,389
tons of detail
in those driver's licenses.

94
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,424
We did see hundreds of people
every day,

95
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:55,326
and you'd never
want to let a mistake

96
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:56,928
slip through on their forms.

97
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,997
You'd just have
a horrible cascade of problems.

98
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:00,999
Sounds challenging.

99
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:03,501
So, why the law?

100
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:05,637
I mean, why leave the DMV...
or MVD?

101
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,171
I have to imagine

102
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:09,340
you'll be giving up
a good benefits package.

103
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:12,176
Good healthcare
and retirement plans, but...

104
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:14,646
there's a bureaucracy
to government work

105
00:15:14,648 --> 00:15:18,016
that ultimately
became too frustrating.

106
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:19,651
I guess what you'd call it...
too much red tape.

107
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,021
I just want to be somewhere
I can make a difference.

108
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:25,456
Well, that's us. We're all about
making a difference.

109
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,392
And I see here
both Word and Excel...

110
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:28,960
you're comfortable with?
Absolutely.

111
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:30,194
Excel<i> and</i> Word?
Wow.

112
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:32,030
Well, you had me at old people.

113
00:15:32,032 --> 00:15:34,432
Hey, here's a question...
can you start today?

114
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:35,700
I... Can...

115
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:37,568
Yes?

116
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,003
Fantastic. Now, can
you...

117
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:42,340
Can you just
give us a second, Francesca?

118
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:43,675
Absolutely. I...

119
00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:45,076
Of course.

120
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:47,045
Um... Thank you.

121
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:54,352
What are you doing?

122
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:56,387
What? I like her.

123
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:57,956
"Can you start today?"

124
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,691
Don't you think we should see
some more résumés...

125
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:01,225
like, a lot more?

126
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:02,694
She is our first interview.

127
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:04,996
We haven't even
checked her references.

128
00:16:04,998 --> 00:16:06,631
So we'll check 'em.

129
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:08,733
Kim, you've been takin' forever
searching for a paralegal.

130
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:10,134
We need help here.

131
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,569
I haven't found the right fit.

132
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:13,471
Yeah, 'cause you're searching
for perfection,

133
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,606
and perfection is the enemy
of perfectly adequate.

134
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:17,308
So that's the bar here...
adequate?

135
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,711
She's<i> more</i> than adequate!
She worked at the DMV.

136
00:16:19,713 --> 00:16:21,579
That's like
the fifth circle of Hell.

137
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:23,281
Look, she's overqualified.

138
00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:25,083
I-If it doesn't work out,
we can fire her.

139
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:26,551
It's no big deal.

140
00:16:26,553 --> 00:16:28,152
Don't you think someone with
some actual legal experience

141
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:29,420
would be better?

142
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:31,522
Look, I've got a commercial
airing in...

143
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:33,191
11 minutes,

144
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:34,592
so the phones are
gonna be ringin' off the hook

145
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:36,060
and I need help.

146
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:37,595
Can we give her
a test run, please?

147
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:39,957
I got a good feeling
about this.

148
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:43,701
Come on, Kim.

149
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,407
Now, getting these oldsters
to call...

150
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:50,641
that's half the battle,

151
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:52,543
so they need to hear
a friendly voice.

152
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:53,745
Friendly? Absolutely.

153
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:55,413
Speak loudly and clearly,

154
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:57,749
but, be careful
with the loud and clear,

155
00:16:57,751 --> 00:17:00,118
'cause it can come off
as angry.

156
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,319
Be folksy.

157
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:02,653
Put a little sunshine
in your voice.

158
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:04,055
Got it. Okay.

159
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:05,456
You need coffee or water?

160
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,091
You need to hit the head
before things...

161
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:08,459
There it goes.

162
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:13,431
Offices of Jimmy McGill.
How may I help you?

163
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:16,134
I'm sorry.

164
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:18,469
May I put you on hold?
Thank you.

165
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:20,605
Offices of Jimmy McGill.

166
00:17:20,607 --> 00:17:23,207
Please hold.

167
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,542
Sorry about that.

168
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:27,211
What can I do for you?

169
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:31,049
That's right.

170
00:17:31,785 --> 00:17:33,751
Jimmy McGill
from the commercial.

171
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:36,354
Would you look to come in
for a consultation?

172
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:38,389
Folksy... be folksy.

173
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:42,326
Say, is that a dog I'm hearing?

174
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:43,694
It is?

175
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:46,164
Aww, what's her name?

176
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,465
Yeah, Cracker Barrel.

177
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:49,667
It always helps
to mention Cracker Barrel.

178
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:52,503
Well, I think it's great
you let Margaret play inside.

179
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:54,138
It's a hot one out there.

180
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,140
I was thinking
of going over to Cracker Barrel

181
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:58,502
because they've got
such great air-conditioning.

182
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:01,785
Well, yes,
I love their biscuits, too.

183
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:04,849
Well, that's wonderful.

184
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:09,353
Yes, I think a will
<i>is</i> really important.

185
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:12,457
When would you like to come in
and meet Mr. McGill?

186
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:14,392
"Jimmy"! Jimmy.

187
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:15,827
Always Jimmy.

188
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:18,696
This Friday is open.

189
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:20,198
Yes.

190
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,833
Jimmy has a 9:00 free.
Will that work?

191
00:18:21,835 --> 00:18:23,234
Fantastic.

192
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:25,477
Can you spell your name for me?

193
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:29,107
And a number
we can reach you at?

194
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,713
Okay, Dorothy.

195
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:37,582
Look forward to seein' ya.

196
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:40,218
You betcha. Bye, now.

197
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:43,521
I am so sorry.
Thank you for holding.

198
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:45,123
How may I help you?

199
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:47,759
Well, I can set you up
with an appointment.

200
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,461
Jimmy is busy at the moment,
but if you'd like...

201
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:54,365
You sound like
you're outdoors.

202
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:55,867
Are you staying out of the sun?

203
00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:57,635
It's a hot one today.

204
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:01,639
I'm sorry, but Jimmy
is unavailable at the moment.

205
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:04,242
If you'd like to leave
a message, Mr...

206
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:07,645
Ehrmantraut?

207
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,814
"Trout," like the fish?

208
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:14,485
I hear Cracker Barrel
has excellent air...

209
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:18,489
This one really don't want
to talk about Cracker Barrel.

210
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,658
Yeah, patch that one through.

211
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,294
Mr. McGill will take your call.

212
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:28,599
Hey.

213
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:30,601
Your new assistant's
a real pip.

214
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:33,404
Yeah, thanks for crushing
her spirit on the first day.

215
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:37,208
Thank you, sir. You drive safe.

216
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:39,777
You the only one on this line?

217
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:42,446
Yeah, only me.
What's up?

218
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:45,249
You free
for breakfast tomorrow?

219
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,927
All right,
this is what you're gonna do.

220
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:58,796
You're gonna go inside,
buy a cup of coffee, a meal...

221
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:00,798
whatever... and sit in a booth.

222
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,234
Sometime in the next
10 to 15 minutes,

223
00:20:03,236 --> 00:20:05,303
a guy
in an old green Chevy Blazer

224
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:07,471
is gonna pull into
that parking lot.

225
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:09,874
He'll take a knapsack,
and he'll go inside.

226
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:12,443
I need you to keep an eye
on the knapsack.

227
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:14,478
Let me know
what he does with it.

228
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,813
Does he take
anything out of it?

229
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:18,249
Does he switch the bag
with someone?

230
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:20,818
Does he leave
something from the bag inside?

231
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,954
Right, right, right.
I got it.

232
00:20:22,956 --> 00:20:24,822
Green Chevy Blazer, black top.

233
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:27,425
Yeah. What's in the bag?

234
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:28,659
Is it money?

235
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:30,595
It's got to be money.

236
00:20:30,597 --> 00:20:32,663
Drugs? Is it drugs?

237
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:34,232
Something else?

238
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:35,633
Well, um,
I'm  guessing money.

239
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:36,834
Tell me I'm right.

240
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:38,869
He is gonna be here any minute.

241
00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:40,605
Now, I need you inside.

242
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:42,506
You gonna do the job or not?

243
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:43,741
Fine. I'll do the job.

244
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:47,345
You charmed me into it.

245
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,699
Welcome to Los Polios Hermanos.
May I take your order?

246
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:11,769
I'll have a Polios Classic
and a coffee, black.

247
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:15,006
Would you like the Polios
bonus size for 50 cents more?

248
00:21:15,008 --> 00:21:16,707
No. Normal.

249
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:18,943
Dining in or to go? Dining in.

250
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:20,711
Will that be all today?

251
00:21:20,713 --> 00:21:23,014
Yeah. Your total's $3.19.

252
00:21:28,388 --> 00:21:29,820
Do you want any extra salsa?

253
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:31,789
No. Ketchup.

254
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:46,570
Hi. What can I do for you?

255
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,544
Here you go, sir.

256
00:21:53,546 --> 00:21:54,745
Have a great day.

257
00:21:54,747 --> 00:21:57,014
Yep. You, too.

258
00:22:29,749 --> 00:22:32,616
Sure,
if there's one open.

259
00:22:32,618 --> 00:22:33,951
Yeah.

260
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:40,858
Hi.
Welcome to Los Polios Hermanos.

261
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,460
Can I take your order?

262
00:22:58,511 --> 00:23:00,644
I'm gonna have the sausage.

263
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:12,390
Is that for here or to go?

264
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:14,091
It's for here.

265
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,469
Really?  Yeah.

266
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:35,479
Hi.
Welcome to Los Polios Hermanos.

267
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:36,947
May I take your order?

268
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:39,784
Gimme a number three.
Potatoes, coffee.

269
00:23:39,786 --> 00:23:43,521
Would you like the Polios bonus
size for 50 cents more? No.

270
00:23:43,523 --> 00:23:44,989
Dining in or to go?

271
00:23:44,991 --> 00:23:47,491
In. Will that be all today?

272
00:23:47,493 --> 00:23:48,759
$4.89.

273
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:53,631
Yeah, no problem.

274
00:23:55,001 --> 00:23:57,435
Do you need
any extra salsa?

275
00:23:57,437 --> 00:23:59,136
Yeah, gimme that.

276
00:24:12,718 --> 00:24:15,052
Here you go.

277
00:24:15,054 --> 00:24:18,122
Have a great day.

278
00:25:16,249 --> 00:25:18,215
Thank you for coming
to Los Polios Hermanos.

279
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:20,577
Have a great day.

280
00:27:23,876 --> 00:27:26,977
Can I help you?

281
00:27:29,915 --> 00:27:32,349
My watch, clasp is loose.

282
00:27:32,351 --> 00:27:33,751
It... falls.

283
00:27:33,753 --> 00:27:35,853
I tried to reach it.

284
00:27:35,855 --> 00:27:37,921
Well, I'm sorry.

285
00:27:37,923 --> 00:27:41,125
Allow me.

286
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:44,094
Y'know,
they say a nice watch band

287
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:45,929
is as important as the watch.

288
00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:48,165
That's what I get for cheapin' out.

289
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:51,702
We'll find it for you.

290
00:27:53,105 --> 00:27:55,205
Where the heck is it?

291
00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:56,774
Don't worry.

292
00:27:56,776 --> 00:27:59,276
If it's in here, I'll...

293
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:01,912
There it is.

294
00:28:03,115 --> 00:28:04,448
May I clean this for you?

295
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:05,849
We have alcohol wipes.

296
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:07,818
Nah,
it's been in worse places.

297
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,119
Thank you.

298
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:10,888
That was very nice of you.

299
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,790
No problem. It's my pleasure.

300
00:28:14,393 --> 00:28:16,293
Is there anything else I
can do for you? No.

301
00:28:16,295 --> 00:28:17,695
Thanks.

302
00:28:17,697 --> 00:28:18,962
You take care.

303
00:28:20,966 --> 00:28:22,299
Tell me again.

304
00:28:22,301 --> 00:28:23,801
Jesus.

305
00:28:23,803 --> 00:28:25,436
How many different ways
you want me to say it?

306
00:28:25,438 --> 00:28:27,371
Just tell me what you saw.

307
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:29,873
He came in,
like you said he would.

308
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:33,744
He ordered the number three
with potatoes and coffee,

309
00:28:33,746 --> 00:28:36,113
went bold with the extra salsa,

310
00:28:36,115 --> 00:28:38,982
and he paid cash
out of his left front pocket.

311
00:28:38,984 --> 00:28:40,818
Took his tray of food,

312
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:43,320
sat in a booth on the east side
of the restaurant,

313
00:28:43,322 --> 00:28:45,456
and put the knapsack
on the floor.

314
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:46,890
Where on the floor?

315
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:48,926
Under his seat,
between his legs.

316
00:28:48,928 --> 00:28:50,260
Nobody touched it.

317
00:28:50,262 --> 00:28:52,396
He didn't talk to anybody.

318
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:54,998
He didn't even <i>look</i> at anybody.

319
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,101
Finished his meal
in five minutes, tops,

320
00:28:57,103 --> 00:28:59,503
and skedaddled...
didn't leave anything behind.

321
00:28:59,505 --> 00:29:01,004
And you're sure of that?

322
00:29:01,006 --> 00:29:03,974
I literally
checked the trash can.

323
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:06,343
There was nothing in there
but trash.

324
00:29:08,848 --> 00:29:11,815
So... what's our next move,

325
00:29:11,817 --> 00:29:14,451
Are we gonna follow this guy?

326
00:29:14,453 --> 00:29:17,988
'Cause you... you got some
real James Bond stuff in here.

327
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:20,891
This car doesn't have
an ejector seat, does it?

328
00:29:20,893 --> 00:29:23,174
I think we're done for today.

329
00:29:23,863 --> 00:29:25,929
That's it? That's it.

330
00:29:27,867 --> 00:29:30,167
I mean, I cleared my morning.

331
00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:32,870
What...
we're not gonna do, like,

332
00:29:32,872 --> 00:29:36,039
tail him
to a new location?

333
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:38,475
Or, I mean, we got to
sit on him, at least. I...

334
00:29:38,477 --> 00:29:43,781
Thanks for your time.

335
00:29:50,556 --> 00:29:54,391
Hey, who's got your back?

336
00:29:54,393 --> 00:29:56,794
Me... that's who.

337
00:29:59,532 --> 00:30:03,300
I'll keep that in mind.

338
00:32:58,577 --> 00:33:01,144
Kim, the conference call
with the Arizona regulator

339
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:02,379
needs to be rescheduled.

340
00:33:02,381 --> 00:33:03,580
Thursday okay?

341
00:33:03,582 --> 00:33:05,082
Yeah, that's fine.

342
00:33:05,084 --> 00:33:06,583
Okay.

343
00:33:06,585 --> 00:33:08,218
Francesca, have we got any more

344
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,686
of those dietetic
butter cookies?

345
00:33:09,688 --> 00:33:11,088
I can check.

346
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:12,422
Thanks. -

347
00:33:12,424 --> 00:33:14,091
Welcome, folks!

348
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:28,338
Hey, Ernie. What's up?

349
00:33:31,744 --> 00:33:34,745
Can't you just come inside?

350
00:33:48,227 --> 00:33:49,760
Sorry.

351
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,130
Thanks.

352
00:33:53,132 --> 00:33:54,731
What are we doing out here?

353
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:56,466
I didn't want to call you

354
00:33:56,468 --> 00:33:59,169
because then it would leave
a phone record.

355
00:33:59,171 --> 00:34:00,637
I was gonna come in,

356
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:03,473
but then I thought
maybe Jimmy shouldn't see me.

357
00:34:03,475 --> 00:34:04,775
So...

358
00:34:04,777 --> 00:34:06,777
But you just called me.

359
00:34:08,347 --> 00:34:10,547
Guess I screwed up already.

360
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:12,783
Ernie, screwed what up?

361
00:34:12,785 --> 00:34:14,317
Why don't you want
to see Jimmy?

362
00:34:14,319 --> 00:34:18,655
Well, it's just...

363
00:34:18,657 --> 00:34:20,257
I'm not sure how to start.

364
00:34:20,259 --> 00:34:22,559
You can start
by just telling me.

365
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:25,695
Here's the thing.

366
00:34:25,697 --> 00:34:27,130
I have some information,

367
00:34:27,132 --> 00:34:28,665
but I don't want
to get in trouble.

368
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:31,134
Trouble with Jimmy?

369
00:34:31,136 --> 00:34:33,270
No. With HHM.

370
00:34:33,272 --> 00:34:36,106
I think I'm bound
by confidentiality, maybe?

371
00:34:36,108 --> 00:34:38,508
I'm a little hazy
on the legal points,

372
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:43,680
but if I tell<i> you</i> what I heard
and not Jimmy directly,

373
00:34:43,682 --> 00:34:46,750
like... like, we have a buffer,

374
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:48,852
then legally, I'm safe?

375
00:34:48,854 --> 00:34:50,353
Ernie.

376
00:34:50,355 --> 00:34:52,155
What the hell
are you talking about?

377
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:56,326
I'm... I'm just worried
about Jimmy.

378
00:34:56,328 --> 00:34:58,428
But if I tell him...

379
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:02,265
I don't want
to get in trouble, too.

380
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:06,269
Tell Jimmy what?

381
00:35:07,673 --> 00:35:10,273
Lily, I want to thank you
for bringing your mom down.

382
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:12,275
It was a delight
to meet<i> you,</i> young lady.

383
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:13,844
Thank you, Jimmy.

384
00:35:13,846 --> 00:35:15,712
And you tell your friends,
even if they already

385
00:35:15,714 --> 00:35:17,547
have a will, it's important
to get it updated,

386
00:35:17,549 --> 00:35:19,716
just like you did.
I'll tell them.

387
00:35:19,718 --> 00:35:21,384
Now, you remember Francesca...

388
00:35:21,386 --> 00:35:23,753
she'll take care of you
the rest of the way.

389
00:35:23,755 --> 00:35:25,856
All right, who's next?
Mr. Witchell.

390
00:35:25,858 --> 00:35:27,657
Mr. Witchell, come on down!

391
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:30,594
You're the next contestant
on "The Price is Right"!

392
00:35:30,596 --> 00:35:32,395
Jimmy, can I have a moment?

393
00:35:32,397 --> 00:35:34,197
Excuse me, sir. Um, looks
like everything is...

394
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:35,732
Apologies, Mr. Witchell.

395
00:35:35,734 --> 00:35:37,667
I'll just be a second, folks.
My gosh.

396
00:35:37,669 --> 00:35:39,736
Have you guys had the soup
over at Cracker Barrel today?

397
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:45,242
What?

398
00:35:45,244 --> 00:35:47,410
What?! Hey, come on.

399
00:35:47,412 --> 00:35:49,246
I got people out there.

400
00:35:49,248 --> 00:35:51,515
Hello. I can't...
Gimme a dollar.

401
00:35:51,517 --> 00:35:53,250
Give you a dollar? Yeah,
just hand me a dollar.

402
00:35:53,252 --> 00:35:54,451
Okay. C'mon.

403
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:57,220
All I got's a $20.

404
00:35:57,222 --> 00:35:58,421
Fine. Whatever.

405
00:35:58,423 --> 00:36:00,757
All right. I'm your lawyer now.

406
00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:02,759
If anyone asks me what I know,

407
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:04,261
we have confidentiality.

408
00:36:04,263 --> 00:36:05,595
Why do we need confidentiality?

409
00:36:05,597 --> 00:36:08,265
Jimmy,
what did you say to Chuck?

410
00:36:10,536 --> 00:36:12,335
Here it comes.

411
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:13,904
Howard, right?

412
00:36:13,906 --> 00:36:15,906
Did Howard call? R-Relax.

413
00:36:15,908 --> 00:36:17,607
No. Let me explain, please.

414
00:36:17,609 --> 00:36:19,176
Please.

415
00:36:19,178 --> 00:36:21,912
Kim, let me set the stage
for you, okay?

416
00:36:21,914 --> 00:36:23,613
When I went
to Chuck's place last week,

417
00:36:23,615 --> 00:36:25,482
it was like the inside
of a Jiffy Pop wrapper,

418
00:36:25,484 --> 00:36:26,683
all right?

419
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:28,318
There was Mylar on the walls.

420
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,754
There was Mylar
on the ceiling... the ceiling.

421
00:36:30,756 --> 00:36:32,789
He thought
his brain wasn't working

422
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:34,791
because of
the Mesa Verde of it,

423
00:36:34,793 --> 00:36:39,729
and so I kinda told him that
he was right about everything.

424
00:36:39,731 --> 00:36:40,931
I had to.

425
00:36:40,933 --> 00:36:42,832
He... He... Kim, he was broken.

426
00:36:42,834 --> 00:36:44,301
He was a broken man!

427
00:36:44,303 --> 00:36:46,303
I couldn't leave him
in Crazy Town like that!

428
00:36:46,305 --> 00:36:48,872
So I told him, you know,
just to make him feel better,

429
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:50,507
but it doesn't matter
what he says...

430
00:36:50,509 --> 00:36:51,775
it doesn't matter who he tells,

431
00:36:51,777 --> 00:36:53,310
because it's my word
against his!

432
00:36:53,312 --> 00:36:54,978
Jimmy, there's a tape.

433
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,447
What?

434
00:36:57,449 --> 00:37:00,884
There is a tape recording
of you talking to Chuck.

435
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:04,487
What do you mean? Who? Who?

436
00:37:04,489 --> 00:37:06,489
He... He taped me? How?

437
00:37:06,491 --> 00:37:07,791
I don't know how.

438
00:37:07,793 --> 00:37:10,493
He just did, okay?
Ernie told me.

439
00:37:10,495 --> 00:37:11,695
Ernie told you?

440
00:37:11,697 --> 00:37:13,396
He said Chuck
has a tape recorder

441
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:15,832
wrapped in a space blanket
in his desk drawer.

442
00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:17,767
Ernie was putting new batteries
in it for Chuck,

443
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:19,502
and the tape rolled
for a few seconds,

444
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:21,838
and he heard you...
your voice...

445
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:25,008
saying something about
switching 1261 to 1216.

446
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:27,877
So, clearly, it was
this confession of yours.

447
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:32,749
He taped me?

448
00:37:43,996 --> 00:37:45,929
Yes, Jimmy.

449
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:52,602
But I'm not sure
what he can do with it...

450
00:37:54,706 --> 00:37:56,940
legally, anyway.

451
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:00,944
I'm gonna have to
do some research.

452
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,447
He made that tape for a reason,

453
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:06,983
and we just have to
figure out why.

454
00:38:13,592 --> 00:38:15,859
Jimmy?

455
00:38:16,862 --> 00:38:19,462
I gotta get back to it.

456
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:22,399
The lobby's full of clients.

457
00:38:22,401 --> 00:38:24,000
Okay.

458
00:38:25,003 --> 00:38:28,038
We'll figure this out.

459
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,040
Yeah. I know.

460
00:38:32,911 --> 00:38:34,377
Sorry for the delay, everyone!

461
00:38:34,379 --> 00:38:35,979
Mr. Witchell,
thank you for your patience.

462
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:38,182
I see you brought paperwork.

463
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:45,488
I got to say,
I would never have thought

464
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:46,990
to collect bottle caps.

465
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:49,059
It's a wonderful hobby.

466
00:38:49,061 --> 00:38:51,661
What excites me is the hunt.

467
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:53,930
I can imagine.

468
00:38:53,932 --> 00:38:55,765
Pleasure doing business
with you, Mr. Tiller.

469
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:57,934
Why, thank you, Jimmy.

470
00:38:57,936 --> 00:38:59,602
All right, then.
You drive safe.

471
00:38:59,604 --> 00:39:01,838
I do.

472
00:39:06,545 --> 00:39:09,079
Is that the last one,

473
00:39:09,081 --> 00:39:11,614
or we got any stragglers
coming through?

474
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,896
Last one.

475
00:39:13,885 --> 00:39:16,519
Well, hey, thanks, Francesca.

476
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:18,088
You were great today.

477
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:19,622
You, too.

478
00:39:19,624 --> 00:39:21,458
Those folks love you.

479
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:26,396
Who doesn't?

480
00:39:34,139 --> 00:39:36,773
And that's U.S. v. McKeever?

481
00:39:36,775 --> 00:39:39,376
Right. No, it makes sense.

482
00:39:40,479 --> 00:39:42,112
You were a tremendous help,
professor.

483
00:39:42,114 --> 00:39:45,048
Thanks for finding the time.

484
00:39:46,118 --> 00:39:47,717
You, too.

485
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,686
Thanks again.

486
00:39:56,661 --> 00:39:58,728
Francesca,
could you do me a favor?

487
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,930
Can you go through the
Mesa Verde files in my office

488
00:40:00,932 --> 00:40:02,799
and pull all the ones
labeled "CRA evaluations"

489
00:40:02,801 --> 00:40:04,134
and sort them by date?

490
00:40:04,136 --> 00:40:06,136
I need to make sure
I have the most recent.

491
00:40:06,138 --> 00:40:08,505
Absolutely. Thank you.

492
00:40:08,507 --> 00:40:11,441
I'll join you in a minute. Okay.

493
00:40:13,445 --> 00:40:16,146
So... just got off the phone

494
00:40:16,148 --> 00:40:18,148
with my old Crim-Pro professor.

495
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,849
Yeah? What'd he say?

496
00:40:19,851 --> 00:40:22,152
Well, as we know,
New Mexico is one-party consent,

497
00:40:22,154 --> 00:40:24,854
so Chuck had a right
to make the recording.

498
00:40:24,856 --> 00:40:28,625
But you went to him
worried for his mental health.

499
00:40:28,627 --> 00:40:30,660
You said the things you did
to make him feel better,

500
00:40:30,662 --> 00:40:31,861
which

501
00:40:31,863 --> 00:40:33,163
Mitigates
the admission of guilt,

502
00:40:33,165 --> 00:40:35,098
at the very least.

503
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:38,701
We can poke holes
in the custody,

504
00:40:38,703 --> 00:40:40,904
throw doubt the voice
on the tape is even yours.

505
00:40:40,906 --> 00:40:42,639
Even failing that,

506
00:40:42,641 --> 00:40:45,542
its probative value doesn't
outweigh how prejudicial it is.

507
00:40:45,544 --> 00:40:48,711
I think we can get the
whole thing bounced under 403.

508
00:40:48,713 --> 00:40:50,947
Probably get it
excluded outright.

509
00:40:52,884 --> 00:40:54,150
So, then...

510
00:40:54,152 --> 00:40:57,787
outside the courts,
what can you do?

511
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:02,192
Play the tape for Kevin
at Mesa Verde?

512
00:41:02,194 --> 00:41:03,593
He hasn't up to now.

513
00:41:03,595 --> 00:41:04,961
I'd have heard something,
for sure.

514
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:06,896
And you know what?
I don't think he's going to.

515
00:41:06,898 --> 00:41:08,731
I don't think Howard
will let him near Mesa Verde

516
00:41:08,733 --> 00:41:10,066
with that tape.

517
00:41:10,068 --> 00:41:12,469
Howard knows it would make HHM
look terrible.

518
00:41:19,211 --> 00:41:21,077
If Chuck has a plan
for this tape,

519
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:22,645
I don't know what it is.

520
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:25,648
At this point, all we can do
is wait for his move,

521
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:26,983
then act accordingly.

522
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:35,058
All right, then.

523
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,493
Thanks.

524
00:41:36,495 --> 00:41:38,161
Sure.

525
00:41:39,764 --> 00:41:41,598
Hey, what do you think?

526
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:46,236
Um, it's "Etude in Blue"
over "Daydream Harvest."

527
00:41:46,238 --> 00:41:48,605
I wanted it to look like morning
over the Sandias.

528
00:41:48,607 --> 00:41:51,574
I like it. It looks nice.

529
00:41:51,576 --> 00:41:53,643
It doesn't look like
a stock-market crash?

530
00:41:53,645 --> 00:41:54,878
No.

531
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,780
It doesn't look like
a stock-market crash.

532
00:41:57,782 --> 00:41:59,782
It's nice.

533
00:41:59,784 --> 00:42:01,150
Thanks.

534
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:08,591
You okay?

535
00:42:11,296 --> 00:42:13,696
Kim, I'm good.

536
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:57,193
Yeah.

537
00:46:53,378 --> 00:46:55,478
Howard,
what are you doing here?

538
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,314
Chuck, do you have a second?
Did you...

539
00:46:58,316 --> 00:47:00,249
You parked over on the next block?
Yeah.

540
00:47:00,251 --> 00:47:02,018
Way over.

541
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:04,140
Phone. Keys.

542
00:47:05,023 --> 00:47:07,256
Hey, you have to hide them.

543
00:47:20,238 --> 00:47:21,838
Everything okay, sir?

544
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,573
Yes, thank you, David.
Give us a moment.

545
00:47:23,575 --> 00:47:25,107
Yes, sir.

546
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:29,412
What's up? Chuck...

547
00:47:29,414 --> 00:47:32,949
this has been going on
for eight days now,

548
00:47:32,951 --> 00:47:35,284
and really, no indication
that it's going to work.

549
00:47:35,286 --> 00:47:36,485
It will work.

550
00:47:36,487 --> 00:47:38,521
I think I've been very patient,

551
00:47:38,523 --> 00:47:41,123
but the cost of these

552
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:44,126
'round-the-clock
private investigators is...

553
00:47:44,128 --> 00:47:46,128
really starting to add up.

554
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:48,431
Howard, this is our duty.

555
00:47:48,433 --> 00:47:50,967
As officers of the court,

556
00:47:50,969 --> 00:47:52,602
we have
an ethical obligation to...

557
00:47:52,604 --> 00:47:54,971
Yes. My brother broke the law.

558
00:47:54,973 --> 00:47:57,273
We can't just sit back
and do nothing.

559
00:47:57,275 --> 00:47:59,308
I'm not talking about
doing nothing.

560
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:02,311
I just want to...
free up our minds

561
00:48:02,313 --> 00:48:05,982
and be open
to alternate strategies, please.

562
00:48:07,318 --> 00:48:09,619
Meet me halfway here.

563
00:48:12,991 --> 00:48:17,360
I suppose... I suppose
we could limit the investigators

564
00:48:17,362 --> 00:48:19,362
to just nighttime hours.

565
00:48:19,364 --> 00:48:20,563
Nighttime. Yes.

566
00:48:20,565 --> 00:48:22,632
Jimmy will most likely break in

567
00:48:22,634 --> 00:48:24,467
while he thinks I'm sleeping...

568
00:48:24,469 --> 00:48:26,636
I mean, I wouldn't
put anything past him.

569
00:48:26,638 --> 00:48:28,337
It just makes the most sense

570
00:48:28,339 --> 00:48:30,539
he'll try to steal the tape
under cover of darkness.

571
00:48:30,541 --> 00:48:32,341
You really think
he's going to do that?

572
00:48:32,343 --> 00:48:34,010
I do, indeed.

573
00:48:34,012 --> 00:48:36,279
How can you be so sure?

574
00:48:36,281 --> 00:48:40,683
Howard,
I know my brother.

575
00:48:43,154 --> 00:48:45,054
Chuck!

576
00:48:45,056 --> 00:48:47,423
Chuck!

577
00:48:48,593 --> 00:48:50,259
Open the damn door, Chuck!

578
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:52,161
Open the door, damn it!

579
00:48:52,163 --> 00:48:53,462
Jimmy, go away!

580
00:48:53,464 --> 00:48:55,031
Open the door!

581
00:48:55,033 --> 00:48:56,632
Open it now! I'm not
opening the door!

582
00:48:56,634 --> 00:48:59,568
I swear to God, Chuck...
I am not op... Jimmy!

583
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:02,672
Jimmy! You taped me?!
You asshole!

584
00:49:02,674 --> 00:49:04,206
Jimmy!

585
00:49:04,208 --> 00:49:05,708
You pulled that heartstrings con
job on me?!

586
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:07,243
You piece of shit!

587
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:10,680
"My brain used to work.

588
00:49:10,682 --> 00:49:12,381
I'm sick.
I don't know what to do!"

589
00:49:12,383 --> 00:49:13,683
Asshole!

590
00:49:13,685 --> 00:49:16,185
No wonder Rebecca left you!

591
00:49:17,188 --> 00:49:18,721
What took her so long?!

592
00:49:21,192 --> 00:49:23,192
There it is!

593
00:49:26,497 --> 00:49:29,098
Here we go.

594
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:31,100
Here we go!

595
00:49:31,102 --> 00:49:33,502
Here we go!

596
00:49:39,043 --> 00:49:40,376
Is this it?

597
00:49:40,378 --> 00:49:41,677
Is this it?

598
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:43,212
Is this it?

599
00:49:44,682 --> 00:49:47,383
For this,
you destroyed our family?

600
00:49:47,385 --> 00:49:48,751
You happy now?!

601
00:49:48,753 --> 00:49:51,253
For what?! For nothing!

602
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:54,690
Is that all there is, Chuck?

603
00:49:56,094 --> 00:49:57,360
It's all the... all there is?

604
00:49:57,362 --> 00:49:58,728
Or'd you make copies?
Chuck?

605
00:50:00,131 --> 00:50:01,597
You tell me,

606
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,399
or I'll burn this whole
goddamn house to the ground!

607
00:50:03,401 --> 00:50:05,001
Jimmy! Jimmy!

608
00:50:05,003 --> 00:50:06,268
That's enough!

609
00:50:08,039 --> 00:50:10,280
You need to step away.

610
00:50:11,009 --> 00:50:12,274
Howard...

611
00:50:12,276 --> 00:50:15,745
you were a witness
to what happened here?

612
00:50:15,747 --> 00:50:17,279
I was.

613
00:50:17,281 --> 00:50:18,547
And you?

614
00:50:18,549 --> 00:50:20,483
I'm a witness.
