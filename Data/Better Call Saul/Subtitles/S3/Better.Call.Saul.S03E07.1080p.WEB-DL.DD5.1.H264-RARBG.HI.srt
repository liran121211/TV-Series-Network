absolutely nothing about?

we could get in.

546

Shh! Shh!

547
00:28:13,826 --> 00:28:15,959

for one minute!

00:28:40,286 --> 00:28:42,786

no one's ever heard of?

560
00:28:42,788 --> 00:28:44,054

Hey, fellas.
Uh, you ready?

572

We got the first shot
all lined up.

573
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,881
Can I
walk you through it?
Uh...

574
00:29:10,883 --> 00:29:12,182
We hate
to do this to you, but...

575
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:13,851
We're having
second thoughts.
Yeah.

576
00:29:13,853 --> 00:29:16,053
I get it. That's just nerves.
Just stage fright.

Uh, tell you what...
We got cue cards,

too much money...

a whole lot of return.

That is where you're mistaken,

585

brand awareness.

From now on,
when people think guitars,

587

"abq in tune."

school-recital season,

598
00:30:02,568 --> 00:30:05,035
so where are the kids
gonna get those recorders?

to goodwill.

to keep one thing, right?
