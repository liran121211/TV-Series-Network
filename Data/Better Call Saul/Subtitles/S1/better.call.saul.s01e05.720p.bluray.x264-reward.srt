345
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,712
...situation?
-it's not a situation.

346
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:39,715
It's a condition.

347
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,172
Electromagnetic hypersensitivity.

348
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:45,633
For reasons unknown, my nervous
system has become sensitized...

349
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,936
...to certain frequencies
of electromagnetic radiation-.

350
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:51,639
Your brother called it
an allergy to electricity.

351
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,690
Well, it's an oversimplification.

352
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:56,227
But it's essentially correct.

353
00:23:57,186 --> 00:24:02,408
Electronic devices create
their own electromagnetic fields.

354
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:05,031
The closer I am to such devices...

355
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:07,829
...the worse my symptoms.
-Which are?

356
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,283
Burning sensation on my skin...

357
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:13,210
<i>...a sharp, cold pain in</i> my <i>bones...</i>

358
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:16,414
...muscle fatigue, heart palpitations...

359
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,090
...blurred vision...

360
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,633
...tinnitus...

361
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:22,757
...vertigo, nausea, shortness of breath.

362
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:24,384
- A general--
-It hurts.

363
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:25,714
Yes, it hurts.

364
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:29,268
When did you first experience
these symptoms?

365
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:34,144
- Must have been...
-You left the office 18 months ago.

366
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:38,273
Well, in that case, uh,
must have been almost two years.

367
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:42,983
Two years? That's a--
That's a long time to live with discomfort.

368
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,237
Well, there it is.

369
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,320
You think I'm crazy.

370
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:49,746
I never said that.

371
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:52,496
No, you didn't,
because you're very polite.

372
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,077
But you think it.

373
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:56,912
Otherwise you wouldn't
be talking about commitment.

374
00:24:57,121 --> 00:25:00,000
- You find that idea distressing?
-Who the hell wouldn't?

375
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:04,132
I find it inappropriate for a person...

376
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,384
...suffering from a physical condition.

377
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:11,347
Anyone who's spent more
than a few minutes with me knows...

378
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:15,022
...that this isn't some kind of delusion.
Wouldn't you agree, Kim?

379
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:18,601
JIMMY: Of course she does.
-Well, I'm not a doctor.

380
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,652
You've known me for a decade.

381
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:25,575
Have you ever seen me exhibit any sign,
any sign whatsoever, of mental illness?

382
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,902
See? If I thought for one second

383
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:31,330
you could cure me, believe me,
I'd jump at the chance.

384
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,283
All due respect,
psychiatry doesn't have the answers.

385
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:35,868
I'd very much like to try.

386
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:39,751
Section 43-1-11, part E3.

387
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:44,131
"The proposed commitment is consistent
with the treatment needs of the client...

388
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:48,009
...and with the least drastic
means principle."

389
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:52,343
Do you think subjecting me to this pain
for a month is the least drastic means?

390
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,929
He might as well spend a month
in a wood chipper.

391
00:25:57,056 --> 00:26:00,936
CRUZ:
I understand your frustration. I do.

392
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:05,023
You're obviously
a highly-intelligent man...

393
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,858
...in difficult circumstances.

394
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:11,658
May I ask you a question?
Just for my own interest.

395
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:15,036
- Yeah.
-How do you meet the needs of daily life?

396
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,708
What do you do for light?

397
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,206
How do you prepare food?

398
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:22,665
I use white gas lanterns.
For cooking, I have a camp stove.

399
00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:26,218
I have a large cooler
I keep filled with ice.

400
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:29,672
It's not ideal, but I make do.

401
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,473
CRUZ:
I see.

402
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:33,050
Well, thank you.

403
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:37,263
Would you mind if I took a moment
to speak with your brother?

404
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:40,850
Uh, make sure you still have your wallet
when you're done. Heh.

405
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:42,731
JIMMY: Funny guy.
-Heh.

406
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:43,982
Jimmy.

407
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:49,278
I wanna go home.

408
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,455
That was a dirty trick.

409
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,913
That wasn't a trick.
It was a demonstration.

410
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:06,547
This allergy to electricity isn't real.
It's a manifestation of something deeper.

411
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:10,380
I'm not saying it's 100 percent real,
but Chuck is smarter than you and me.

412
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,510
So we're not talking him out of this.

413
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:15,183
And I'm not sending him
to a rubber room.

414
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:17,307
No one is talking
about rubber rooms.

415
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:19,980
- There are specialists--
-He's seen specialists.

416
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,603
The best doctors.
None of them helped, not one.

417
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,481
So you're ready to give up?

418
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:28,735
Who's giving up, huh? I'm--
I'm the one doing the heavy lifting here.

419
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:31,988
That white gas,
who do you think brings him that?

420
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:35,787
And milk, bread, toilet paper
and ice and every other thing he needs.

421
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:38,912
Is that helping or enabling?

422
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:44,167
If you testify in a custodial hearing,
he can get help. That's in your power.

423
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:47,716
To be committed involuntarily,
he has to be a danger to himself.

424
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,714
- Or others.
-And he is.

425
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:52,797
Coleman lanterns indoors?
A camp stove?

426
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,975
He could burn his house down,
or the entire neighbourhood.

427
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:59,145
And then you're looking
at a commitment of 1O to 20 years.

428
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:02,689
What if--? What if he just hurts himself
in a household accident?

429
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,892
How does he call for help?

430
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,863
You have the power
to help your brother.

431
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:12,031
Truly help him.

432
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,778
Ignoring this won't make it go away.

433
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,793
What would you do?

434
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:27,252
All I know is...

435
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:29,174
...he needs help.

437
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:42,430
Untie him.
I'm getting him out of here.

438
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,187
The nurse will bring you release forms.

439
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,074
Oh, boy.

440
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:05,411
- Jimmy? Kim?
-I found him.

441
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:08,877
- I thought I'd wait till you got here.
-Great.

442
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:11,379
- How's he doing?
-Better. Resting.

443
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,005
Good.

444
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:17,590
Jimmy, I want you to know
that I've talked to the DA...

445
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:21,473
...and he absolutely will not sign off
on any commitment papers.

446
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:23,805
This is a physical condition,
not mental.

447
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:27,516
Chuck is of sound mind.
I think we can all agree on that.

448
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:30,485
You're a real peach, Howard.

449
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:32,780
Of course you don't want
Chuck committed.

450
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,153
No, I don't. Why would I?

451
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:38,156
If Chuck were committed,
I'd become his legal guardian.

452
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,034
- And I'd cash him out of HHM.
-Jesus, Jimmy. Now?

453
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:42,706
You wanna hash that out here?

454
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:45,876
JIMMY: The tanning bed must have
melted your brain if you think--

455
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:49,080
- Guys, Chuck, that's why we're here.
-Yes.

456
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:50,505
Let's stay on point.

457
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:54,336
We're talking about the well-being
of a man whom we all love very much.

458
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:55,795
There's many factors.

459
00:29:56,003 --> 00:30:00,053
- Spite doesn't have to be one of them.
-I was on the fence till you showed up.

460
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:03,477
Thanks for helping me decide.
Wave bye-bye to your cash cow...

461
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:06,772
...because it's leaving the pasture.
I'm committing him.

Jimmy, wait. Jimmy--
Jimmy, can you wait?

00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:20,494
Jimmy, wait a second.
Listen, I agree that Chuck needs help.

465
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:24,324
And maybe it's the right thing to do,
but you can't do it like this.

466
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:30,121
I just wanna see that son of a bitch sweat.
It's so obvious what he's afraid of.

467
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,207

Wanna talk about this?

Nothing to talk about.

487
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:11,347
You took the paper,
you saw this, you got sick.

488
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,395
What's your point?

489
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:19,196
Chuck, I think you got sick
because you saw this story.

490
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,319
Whenever you think
I've done something wrong...

491

...something questionable,
you get worse.

492
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:27,697
I didn't get sick because
I read about you in the paper.

493
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:32,956
I got sick because I went out of my house
to retrieve the paper--

494
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:36,246
I'm too tired for this argument, Jimmy.

495
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:38,173
I've had it too many times.

You think this is the return

All right.

498
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:46,632
You think the billboard thing
was unethical.

499
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,060
But it was promotion.
It was advertising, that's all.

500
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:53,480
Which wasn't even allowed
until five Supreme Court justices...

501
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,274
<i>...went bonkers
in Bates v. State Bar of Arizona.</i>

502
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:59,103
- Ah-ha.
-But in any event...

503
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:03,448
it's legal. If you wanna advertise,
that's your business.

504
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,400
“Business" being the operative word...

505
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:08,613
...because I have gotten business
off of this.

506
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:12,666
Legit business: wills, trusts.

507
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:16,587
I'm kind of starting to specialise
in elder law.

508
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,003
- Elder law?
-Yeah.

509
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:20,833
The things the elderly have
to deal with. I mean...

00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:24,045
...relatives coming after their savings,
telemarketers...

511
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:27,847
...reverse-mortgage scams.
I mean, getting old sucks.
