180
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:27,853
What?

181
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,229
You look like Matlock.

182
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:33,905
No, I look like a young Paul Newman
dressed as Matlock.

189
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:58,554
Uh...

190

Hope it's good to the last drop
because I'm billing you the full hour for it.

You serious? Why'd you
have me bring it to you?

194
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:13,569
All right,
here's what's gonna happen:

195
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,193
Those two cops out there
are from Philadelphia.

196
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,990
They've come a long way
to see me.

197
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,910
When they come in here,
we're all gonna have a little chat.

198
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,489
When it's over, the young one,
who's been writing in his little notebook...

199
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:28,076
...he's gonna take it and put it
in his jacket, and when he does that...

200
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,333
...I want you to take that coffee
and spill it on him.

201
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,748
Little accident, that's all.

202
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,254
And why, pray tell,
would I do that?

203
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:39,212
Because I'm asking you to.
It's the only reason you're here.

204
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,173
So I'm here because you want me
to assault a police officer?

205
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:47,479
I am asking you to take a few ounces
of lukewarm coffee and spill it on him.

206
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:51,023
I doubt that satisfies
the definition of "assault."

207
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:54,068
But, hey, you're the lawyer.

208
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,817

...work for the Philadelphia
Police Department...

00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:45,555
...as did Mr. Ehrmantraut
for nearly 30 years.

Philadelphia? Go, Eagles.

245
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:52,266
Mr. Ehrmantraut had a son, Matt,
he too was with Philly P.D.

246
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:55,189
He was a rookie officer
with about two years on the job.

247
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,767
- He was a good cop.
-Yes, he was.

248
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,278
About nine months ago,
he responded to a shots-fired call...

249
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,481
...in some west-side rattrap.

250
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,067
Matt went in with his partner,
Officer Troy Hoffman.

251
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:09,028
They had Sergeant Jack Fensky
backing them up.

252
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:11,535
Unfortunately,
things got out of hand.

253
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:15,118
The three of them were ambushed,
and, uh, Matt didn't make it out.

254
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:18,455
Now, Hoffman and Fensky returned fire,
but the shooter got away.

255
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:23,089
We chased a few leads, shook up
the usual suspects, came up short.

256
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,008
I'm very sorry to hear it.

257
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,474
Anyways, we kept beating the bushes,
kept coming up dry...

258
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:32,518
...until three months ago.

259
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,595
That's when Hoffman and Fensky
turned up dead...

260
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,397
...in a vacant lot out in Nicetown.

261
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:39,146
Again, an ambush
of some kind, it looks like.

262
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:42,479
And with whoever killed Matt
out there in the wind, we're thinking--

263
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,030
Well, it's our operating theory...

264
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,324
...that Hoffman and Fensky
were mixed up in something.

265
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:48,197
Some bad business.

266
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:49,948

00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,849
I talked sense.

517
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:47,728
No one was getting hurt.

518
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:52,320
But if you go to the IA, if you
even look like you're going...

519
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,857
He had a wife.

520
00:37:56,149 --> 00:37:57,901
A kid.

521
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:00,532
Responsibilities.

522
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:05,075
Take the money,
do something good with it.

523
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,660
[CHUCKLES]

524
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,712
Uh-uh.

525
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,212
I tried.

526
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,010
I tried.

527
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:19,680
But he wouldn't listen.

528
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:21,303
[CHUCKLES]

529
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,099
My boy was stubborn.

530
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:29,565
My boy was strong.

531
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:31,309
And he was gonna...

532
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:33,145
...get himself killed.

533
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:36,565
So I told him...

534
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:40,823
I told him I did it too.

535
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:43,655
That I was like Hoffman,
getting by.

536
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:46,537
And that's what you heard
that night.

537
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:49,164
Me talking him down,
him kicking and screaming...

538
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:51,792
...until the fight went out of him.

539
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,715
He put me up on a pedestal.

540
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:02,257
And I had to show him...

541
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:06,516
...that I was down in the gutter
with the rest of them.

542
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,229
Broke my boy.

543
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,564
I broke my boy.

544
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:24,329
He went to Hoffman, he took
the money, but he hesitated.

545
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:26,702
Even looking like you're doing
the right thing...

546
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:32,754
...to those two, meant that he wasn't solid,
that he couldn't be trusted.

547
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,503
I got Matty to take the money.

548
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,764
And they killed him
two days later.

549
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:55,485
He was the strongest person
that I ever knew.

550
00:39:56,269 --> 00:40:00,319
He'd have never done it,
not even to save himself.

551
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,244
I was the only one.

552
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:10,492
I was the only one that could get him
to debase himself like that.

553
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:16,335
And it was for nothing.

554
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:20,631
I made him lesser.

555
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,969
I made him like me.

556
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:32,681
And the bastards killed him anyway.

557
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:54,624
Hoffman and Fensky...

558
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,837
...if they killed Matty...

559
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,553
...who killed them?

560
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:06,590
Pop?

561
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,141
What happened?

562
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,974
You know what happened.

563
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:20,312
The question is...

564
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,784
...can you live with it?

565
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:46,129
