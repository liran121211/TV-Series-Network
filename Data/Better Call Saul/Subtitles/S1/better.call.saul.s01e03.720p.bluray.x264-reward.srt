Tell me the kids are okay.

341
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:48,069
You wanna tell me your thoughts
and weigh in?

342
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:52,744
Does this sound like a plan
that you can get behind?

343
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:57,909
You miserable piece of shit.

344
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:02,004
You set me up.

345
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:03,456
I what?

346
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:07,589
You gave my score to another crew
and now you're setting me up.

347
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:10,387
What the--? What?
Did the cops beat you?

348
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,681
You're talking like a person
with head trauma.

349
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:16,101
- You think you're funny?
-You had nothing to do with this?

350
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:19,430
That was your van outside
the house. You weren't there?

351
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:22,562
Yeah, I was there.

352
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,814
I was casing the place.

353
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:28,443
Figuring out the best way in and out,
what time they went to bed, all that.

354
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,947
They were fine when I left.
That's it.

355
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:34,495
You had nothing to do
with the Kettlemans?

356
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:37,744
I was never in the house.

357
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:42,540
What about the blood
in your van?

358
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:47,295
They DNA my ride, all they're gonna find
is the blood of your skate rat twins...

359
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:52,096
...plus whatever piss and shit
you leaked out when you were in there.

360
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:56,013
Nobody's been
in the back of that van since.

361
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:00,804
I don't understand.

362
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:05,268
Here's what I understand,
counsellor.

363
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:09,984
I told my plan
to one other person.

364
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:11,566
One.

365
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,195
You.

366
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:18,657
Now here I am under arrest.
Go figure.

367
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:22,744
I don't know anything about
a setup or another crew. Heh.

368
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:28,381
You know what?
I don't even care.

369
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:31,335
The cops are out there now
poking into my business...

370
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:36,014
...and if they find something
on me or my partners, for real...

371
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:38,263
...it's gonna be bad for you.

372
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,640
Really bad.

373
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:44,473
Bad?

374
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:45,728
Bad as in...?

375
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:49,483
You get me out of here today...

376
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:52,197
...or you're a dead man.

377
00:29:03,951 --> 00:29:05,328
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

378
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,503
Oh, hey.

379
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:17,298
I asked if you knew anything.

380
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:19,634
You didn't tell me you were
representing the suspect.

381
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:22,765
- I didn't know at the time.
DUNST: He give up anything?

382
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:26,310
- What?
-Did he tell you where the family is?

383
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,145
He doesn't know.

384
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,853
What does that mean?
He gave them to somebody?

385
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:33,905
- He doesn't know. He didn't do it.
-Give me a break.

386
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:36,234
Guys, can you give us just a minute?

387
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:42,573
Jimmy, that family is in real danger.

388
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,000
You don't have to stand behind
client privilege.

389
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,247
I'm not.

390
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,705
These people can be buried in a box
sucking air through a straw.

391
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,415
I'm sorry if that's where they are.

392
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:54,877
- But my guy didn't do it.
-How are you so sure?

393
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:58,009
You know what you're gonna do?

394
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,215
You're gonna get your special
CSI people...

395
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:02,051
...and test the blood from that van.

396
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:05,388
I guarantee you one billion percent
it's not the Kettlemans'.

397
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:07,188
Whose is it?

398
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:10,017
It's not the Kettlemans'. Just test it.

399
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:13,479
That'll take weeks, if we can even
get a sample to compare it to.

400
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:15,985
Well, isn't that convenient?

401
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:19,033
You've got an innocent man
in there right now...

402
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:22,033
...who I demand you release
with an apology.

403
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:23,329
There are no other suspects.

404
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:26,454
There's no evidence
that points to anyone else.

405
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:27,875
I wanna see the scene.

406
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,168
You are missing something.

407
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,167
RUSSO:
Screw you, "missing something."

408
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:35,501
No, detectives,
I, um... I think that's a good idea.

409
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:37,423
- A good idea?
KIM: Yes.

410
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:40,050
We should invite Mr. McGill
to the house.

411
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,928
- Why?
-Yeah, why?

412
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:52,022
RUSSO:
So, what'd we miss?

413
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:16,876
This is the son's room, Warren.

414
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,719
Twelve years old.

415
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:37,567
Jo Jo's room.

416
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,695
She's 7.

417
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:54,546
All right, you wanted me to crack,
mission accomplished.

418
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,295
But I'm telling you,
my client didn't do this.

419
00:31:57,499 --> 00:32:00,127
Varga was outside
the night the family disappeared.

420
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,382
That is a fact.

421
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,008
Advocate for the guy
all you want...

422
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,261
...after we get these people
back safe.

423
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,968
In the meantime, help us.

424
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:09,765
Where's the doll?

425
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:11,559
Where's the what?

426
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:15,939
Uh, got little shoes, bunch of clothes,
table and chairs, hairbrush...

427
00:32:16,143 --> 00:32:18,396
...but where's the doll
that goes with this?

428
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:21,652
In every picture of this girl,
she's holding the same doll.

429
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:24,576
- So where's the doll?
-What does it matter?

430
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,494
Doll is gone, girl is gone...

431
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:28,789
...which means doll and girl
are most likely together...

432
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:30,912
...which means--
-I have no idea.

433
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:35,622
Which means the kid wasn't dragged
out of the house, ipso facto.

434
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:37,456
Wait. What are you saying?

435
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:41,376
Maybe the Kettlemans
kidnapped themselves.

436
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:47,383
- That's it. You're done. Let's go.
-it makes sense.

437
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:49,593
How? Why would they do that?

438
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:52,395
They stole million dollars plus, right?

439
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:55,145
You wanna get away
with that cash, what do you do?

440
00:32:55,348 --> 00:33:00,195
Run? No, you can't. If you run,
everyone knows you're guilty. Ah.

441
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:03,740
But if you're kidnapped,
you're a victim. Right?

442
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,443
They staged this to throw everyone off.

443
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,449
You are looking in the wrong place.

444
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:11,782
Who knows how many miles
into Mexico or Canada they could be?

445
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,992
You gotta put the word out.

446
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:17,997
Oh, come on, you don't think
it's possible I'm right?

447
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:20,333
It's possible. Unlikely.

448
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,043
JIMMY: Unlikely?
-All their cars are here.

449
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:26,130
There's no record of a taxi
or car service to the house.

450
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:28,841
They didn't get on any planes
or buses or trains.

451
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:32,178
- You checked all that?
-Yes. The doll, it's not news.

452
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,557
We saw it was missing.

453
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:36,356
- So where is it?
-The girl was scared, crying.

454
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:39,776
Bad guy lets the kid
take the doll to shut her up.

455
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:43,614
What? You don't think
that's possible?

456
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:48,444
I need to talk to you alone.

457
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:52,618
I've gotta tell you something,
and promise not to be upset.

458
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:56,167
- No way am I making that promise.
-I called the Kettlemans.

459
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:58,791
After I hung up with you,
I gave them a warning call.

460
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,042
A warning call?

461
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:03,251
I was worried my guy Varga
was going after their money, and he was.

462
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:07,429
He was gonna rip them off.
I deduced it from a conversation we had.

463
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:08,846
It was lawyer-to-client...

464
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,345
...so there was, you know,
confidentiality issues.

465
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:15,350
But I called the Kettlemans
anonymously to warn them.

466
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:16,806
Anonymously? You did--?

467
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:20,017
Oh, God, you didn't--? You didn't
do the sex robot voice, did you?

468
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:22,319
I did the tube and the whole thing.

469
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:26,444
Which probably scared the living shit
out of them and they took off.

470
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:29,367
Which, you know, file that under
unintended consequences...

471
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:32,071
...but you believe me now?

472
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,080
Uh--

473
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:37,242
Great. Now we have to find them.

474
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:41,455
Or better yet,
get the cops to let Varga go...

475
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:45,008
...because right now my ass
is on the highway to the danger zone.

476
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,334
Why are you in danger?

477
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:51,549
Nacho Varga, he didn't kidnap the family,
but he's a bad guy.

478
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:54,885
He's a very bad guy,
and if the cops keep pushing him...

479
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,846
...they're gonna find something.
That happens, Nacho blames me...

480
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:02,184
...then his guys turn me
into a meat pifiata.

481
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:05,692
- Jimmy, tell the police.
-No way I'm gonna rat on this guy.

482
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,897
I will never be safe.

483
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:11,701
I have to convince the cops I'm right,
to stop looking at Nacho...

484
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:15,326
...and catch the Kettlemans on the run.
-And if they never catch them?

485
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:19,121
The Kettlemans?
You've met these people, right?

486
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:20,953
They're not exactly masterminds.

487
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:23,459
They will be caught
if the cops are looking.

488
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:25,461
So you tell them to, would you?

489
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:27,838
The FBI too.
I heard they're getting in on this.

490
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:31,638
- Why would the FBI listen to me?
-Hamlin. They'll listen to him.

491
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,306
A.P.D., at least.

492
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,929
You talk to Howard,
you explain things to him.

493
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,387
He has clout with these people.

494
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:39,938
What, is that a no, or...?

495
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,857
Hamlin will never agree to it.
The Kettlernans are our clients.

496
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:47,438
- This would mean incriminating them.
-See? This is why people hate lawyers.

497
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:50,946
It's Hamlin's call,
and Hamlin will never agree.

498
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:54,323
And even if it were up to me,
you know I couldn't.

499
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:58,995
- I'm sorry, I just--
-I get it.

500
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,122
- Where are you going?
-Gonna talk to Nacho...

501
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:08,834
...try to make him see reason.

502
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:10,669
To beg.

503
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:20,141
Come on.

504
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:23,186
Come on.

505
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:34,951
Right. Yeah, hey. Ahem.

506
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:36,994

00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:46,957
Not an option. You do this
on your own recognizance...

672
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:49,414
...or the cops drag you by your heels.

673
00:45:49,622 --> 00:45:53,172
- Let's go. Kettlemans, time to ship out.
BETSY: No. No.

674
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:57,426
- Yes, you are. This is happening.
-No. No, this is not happening!

675
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:58,756
Yes, Kettlemans.

676
00:45:58,965 --> 00:46:00,763
- No!
-Yes, you are doing this now.

677
00:46:00,967 --> 00:46:02,059
No!

678
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:19,952
Yeah.

679
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:30,830
