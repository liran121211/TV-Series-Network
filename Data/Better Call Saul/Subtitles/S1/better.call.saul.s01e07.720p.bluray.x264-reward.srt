to stave off an arrest...

258
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:17,444
...after the misunderstanding
about your, uh, camping trip.

259
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,691
The DA was concerned
you might be a flight risk.

260
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:24,527
Heh. Flight risk? We were
practically in our own backyard. Heh.

261
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,532
That's exactly what we told the DA.

262
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,488
We've managed to come up with a deal...

263
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,698
...that is favourable
under the circumstances.

00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:33,581

A deal is what they got O.J.

-it's a terrible term.

266
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,710

267
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,841
If the prosecution decides to file...

268
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:43,261
...which is the direction
this seems to be headed...

269
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:45,884
...and if they choose
to stack charges, Craig...

270
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,011
...you're looking at 30 years in prison.

271
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:49,263
Thirty years?

272
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:53,062
That's the maximum. Given the nature
of the charge and political environment...

273
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,639
...I'd say we should expect it.

274
00:16:54,847 --> 00:17:00,024
The public outcry in cases like these
is a big factor. However...

275
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:02,071
...after much discussion
with the DA...

276
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:05,366
...who is also invested in keeping
the press to a minimum...

277
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:08,695
...we have arrived at an arrangement
which would include 16 months...

278
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:11,998
...in a county facility.
-Sixteen months?

279
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:15,998
Down from 30 years. And you
most likely wouldn't serve all of it.

280
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:18,671
But he would have to say
he was guilty.

281
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,545
Admitting wrongdoing
and making the county whole again...

282
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,877
...goes a long way,
hence the minimal sentence.

283
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:25,962
Making the county whole again?

284
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:31,051
It includes the stipulation that you return
$1.6 million in misappropriated funds.

285
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,057
- Give back the money?
-There is no money.

We told you Craig is innocent.

287
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:39,442
I understand.
However, I'd like to emphasise again...

288
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:43,192
...that this deal is Craig's best chance
of minimising jail time.

289
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:48,243
You're telling us there are drug dealers
and murderers walking the streets...

290
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:51,321
...but instead of them, they wanna
put an innocent man in jail?

291
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,202
There's no other way?

292
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:57,001
I'm sorry. I think under the circumstances,
this is your best option.

293
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:01,126

and this is how they--?

294
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:04,216

There never was.

-Ah-- I just told you, there is no money.

299

And go to jail for a year and a half.
But your other choice...

300

...that is no choice at all.

too much excitement, right?

00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:02,627
All right. We've got G-48.
