nobody gets hurt.

515
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,673
We rip them off, easy money.

516
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:49,377
Look, I'm a lawyer, not a criminal.

517
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:52,422
[CHUCKLES]

518
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:55,349
You are shitting me.

519
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:57,348
I crossed a line.

520
00:43:57,552 --> 00:44:00,897
I made a mistake.
I'm not doing that again. Not ever.

521
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:03,976
I got between you and Tuco.

522
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:07,607
Think you'd be here now
if I kept my mouth shut?

523
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:11,658
And I appreciate that. I owe you.

524
00:44:11,858 --> 00:44:15,829
And if you're ever in trouble,
God forbid, legal trouble...

525
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:19,953
...I will be there 24/7 as a lawyer.

526
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:24,871
- What's your angle?
-No angle. Heh.

527
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:30,005
And I'm not saying anything about this
to anybody.

528
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:32,712
As far as I'm concerned,
you're a client...

529
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,388
...this is a consultation...

530
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:37,968
...and everything you just told me
is privileged.

531
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:40,595
You rat, you die.

532
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:43,727
And that too. Yes.

533
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:08,627
For when you figure out
you're in the game.

534
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:12,586
I'm not in the game, I promise.

535
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,217
