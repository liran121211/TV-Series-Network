And I'm gonna pay you back too.

492
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:49,466
- Hamlin was here?
-it's not like I'm a recluse.

493
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:53,132
- He put his cell phone in the mailbox?
-He understands the situation.

494
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:54,883
- He grounded himself?
-Of course.

495
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:57,762
And the two of you agreed that since,
as everybody knows...

496
00:36:57,966 --> 00:36:59,809
...you're going back to work
any day now...

497
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:01,852
...the firm should help you
make ends meet?

498
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,147
That's correct, minus the sarcasm.

499
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:05,815
Hamlin's making you a chump!

500
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:08,143
I'm going to get better!

I understand that
you're trying to look out for me...

00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:51,482
...but you're missing the bigger picture.

00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,488

00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,858

509
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:01,325
Howard brought this.

510
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,657
- He's concerned.
-What?

511
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:05,833
You have to admit,
it could be confusing.

512
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:08,958
Hamlin Hamlin McGill.
James M. McGill.

513
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:13,008
- That's my name, I was born with it. I--
-Still.

514
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,764
How about "Vanguard Law"?

515
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,137
Or "Gibraltar." Pie--

516
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:27,223
Wait, so I'm not supposed
to use my name on Hamlin's say-so?

What's he gonna do, sue me?

Nobody wants to create
an adversarial situation.

00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:36,816
I'm sure Howard would gladly pay
the cost of new matchbooks and so on.

It's simply a matter
of professional courtesy.

Could be the most profitable
30 seconds of your lives.

00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:33,064
Let me tell you about a young guy.

546
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:36,568
Actually, he's about your age.

547
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:38,896
He lived a long way from here...

548
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:43,358
...in a town called Cicero, Illinois.

549
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:47,366
And in Cicero, he was the man.

550
00:40:47,654 --> 00:40:50,157
I mean,
when he strolled down the street...

551
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:52,709
...all the corner boys
would give him the high five.

552
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:56,504
All the finest babes
would smile at him...

553
00:40:56,704 --> 00:41:00,174
...and hope that he would smile back.

554
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:03,970
They called him Slippin' Jimmy...

555
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:08,767
...and everybody wanted
to be his friend.

556
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:11,345
Slippin' Jimmy.

557
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,309
What the hell kind of name is that?

558
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:18,356
Well, I'll tell you now.
Winters in Cicero are murder.

559
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:22,280
You guys, growing up out here
in the Golden West, you don't know.

560
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,986
Okay? I'm talking cold that'll freeze
the snot right in your nose.

561
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:28,911
I'm talking wind
that'll cut through your jacket.-.

562
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:31,080
...and carve you up like a Ginsu knife.

563
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,409
In fact, most folks in Cicero
were scared of winter.

564
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:36,711
But not Jimmy.

565
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:39,213
Jimmy would wait around all summer...

566
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:41,542
...and when September
finally rolled around...

567
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:45,379
...and he'd feel that first cold wind
come sweeping off Lake Michigan...

568
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:48,180
...he knew it was coming.

569
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:51,100
Was it Christmas? Was it Kwanzaa?

570
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:55,180
Better. It was slip-and-fall season.

571
00:41:56,097 --> 00:42:00,443
As soon as it was cold enough,
he'd find a nice, smooth patch of ice.

572
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:03,271
State Street was good,
Michigan Avenue was better.

573
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:06,528
He'd pick his spot,
wait for it to get busy...

574
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:09,577
...then he'd walk out on the ice
and boom!

575
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:11,074
He would biff it so hard...

576
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:14,032
...people would come running
from five blocks away.

577
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,662
Yeah, but did he collect?

578
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:18,746
"Did he collect?"
Slippin' Jimmy had it dialled in.

579
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:22,332
One good fall, he'd clear 6, 8 grand.

580
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,840
That'd keep him in Old Milwaukee
and Maui Waui right through Labor Day.

581
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:28,718
- Eight grand?
-Eight grand.

582
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:31,674
Now, see, I look at you guys,
I see potential.

583
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:34,978
The skateboard's a nice wrinkle,
that makes it a year-round gig.

584
00:42:35,178 --> 00:42:38,307
Clearly, you know how
to take a header. Right?

585
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:40,016
But I gotta ask you...

586
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:43,854
...your best day ever,
how much did you clear?

587
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:49,321
- Six hundred and thirty.
-Six hundred and thirty.

588
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:53,288
Six hundred and thirty bucks?
Was that for one fall?

589
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:56,662
- Two.
-Two falls in one day? Heh.

590
00:42:56,866 --> 00:43:00,496
- Even at your age, that's gotta hurt.
-True that.

591
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:03,923
All right.
Well, I got a job for you.

592
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:05,591
How's 2 grand sound?

593
00:43:05,792 --> 00:43:08,170
Two grand for one hit?

594
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:10,095
One hit.

595
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:13,140

from the best.

598
00:43:19,222 --> 00:43:22,726
Forget the boat. Look at the car.
You know what that is?

599
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:25,062
- I don't know, a station wagon?
-it's a Mercury.

600
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:27,943
A 1988 Mercury Sable wagon.

601
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:30,525
Remember it. Burn it into your brains,
you got it?

602
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:33,077
It's a Mercury Sable wagon, sure.

603
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,780

What colour is it?

604
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:37,035
- Brown.
-Brown.

00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,958

00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:42,002

you're suffering Saint Sebastian, right?

618
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:17,455
You're the hammer. You get in her face,
you scare the bejeezus out of her.

619
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,578
Give me your phone.

-Yeah. Witnesses are good.

621
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:26,084
Witnesses are pressure, all right?

622
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:28,883
Now, once you've got her
good and rattled...

623
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:32,383
...then you call for an ambulance,
but really you're calling for me.
