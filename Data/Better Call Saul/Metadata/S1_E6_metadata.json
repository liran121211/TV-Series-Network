He also had good reason to leave Philadelphia. He was a policeman there as was his son Matt who died in the line of duty. Matt, his partner and his sergeant raided a drug den and Matt didn't come out alive. Now, some of Mike's former colleagues are in town to ask him questions. Mike insists on having a lawyer, even though is only supposed to be a friendly chat. Jimmy shows up, though Mike has a special request of him. In addition to Matt's death, his partner and sergeant were killed in a parking lot 3 months later, the night before Mike left Philadelphia. It's obvious they think Mike had something to do with that.
