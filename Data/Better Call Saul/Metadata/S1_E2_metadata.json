Tuco is hellbent on killing the skateboarders, who not only tried to scam, but also insulted, his much-loved grandmother. Soon they are all in the desert where Tuco plans to dispose of all three of them; now Jimmy has his biggest chance to plead for somebody's life. Tuco is no reasonable man, but one member of his crew, Nacho Varga, sees the value of Jimmy's argument. They compromise--although the skateboarders aren't keen on the solution--and Jimmy is set free. The situation doesn't help Jimmy's business, but Nacho has a suggestion for him.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "3857028", "rating": 8.9, "votes": 25103, "number_of_episodes": 63}
