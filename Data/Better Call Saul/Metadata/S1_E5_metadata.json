Jimmy meets up with a series of unruly clients.", "Jimmy's publicity stunt has served its intended purpose and he soon has a list of prospective clients. The first of these, a somewhat eccentric man by the name of Big Ricky Sipes seems just too good to be true - which is exactly the case. Another is seeking to get a patent on his new invention - which looks very much like a flush toilet. A third wants a will drawn up - perhaps the most complicated ever. Jimmy decides to focus on the elderly and soon finds himself trolling for clients in retirement homes. Meanwhile, Jimmy's brother Chuck has a confrontation with the police after a neighbor complains that he stole their newspaper. He has a mental breakdown and is hospitalized with the doctor recommending he be sent for a 30-day psych evaluation. Mike Ehrmantraut's past seems to have caught up to him and he is taken in by the police.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "3876380", "rating": 8.0, "votes": 19438, "number_of_episodes": 63}
