Nacho is released but doesn't believe Jimmy's story. Meanwhile, Jimmy is fed up with his brother's law partner, Howard Hamlin, and sets out to disrupt him as much as possible. Jimmy starts dressing like him and puts up a huge billboard which drives Hamlin to the edge. After being ordered by an arbitrator to take down the billboard and while filming his plea for fairness, Jimmy apparently saves a worker working on the billboard and he's soon hailed as a hero on local news outlets. Nothing is as it seems, however, but it leads to new clients.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "3864892", "rating": 8.3, "votes": 19879, "number_of_episodes": 63}
