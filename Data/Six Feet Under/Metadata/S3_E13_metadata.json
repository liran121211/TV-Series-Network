Walking in the early hours of the morning to clear his head without success, and drinking heavily and sleeping with a bar prostitute, he's in bad shape and can't accept the news of his mother marrying George. David and Claire are also reluctant, since David is worried about his brother and believes it should be delayed and Claire is worried they haven't known each other long enough to wed, but they know they'll marry either way. Claire visits her father's grave and learns, along with the fact that he's OK with the marriage himself, Lisa, Gabe Dmas, and her child are all with him.

They've only known each other for just over 6 weeks and Nate in particular thinks they're moving just too fast. Nate of course hasn't been himself since Lisa disappearance and a call from the police saying they have found a body doesn't help at all.
