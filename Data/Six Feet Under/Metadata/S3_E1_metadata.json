He arrives early, sick of the food, and sees his funeral (open-casket, not a memorial service after cremation as he wished)...then hears David speaking to him from the next room where he sees himself paralyzed and with speech problems struggling to relearn. He continues through the home and witnesses himself completely healthy living with Lisa and Maya; at Christmas dinner with his family, including his father, who never died; living with a woman he has yet to meet and their son; spending his time lazily, watching TV and drinking beer with a woman. Returning to the funeral room, he meets his father again, who doesn't give him a straight answer on whether he's alive but suggests he just traveled through parallel worlds and must open a white coffin to get his answer....7 months later: Nate, Lisa, and Maya live with Lisa's self-absorbed actor boss Carol, where Lisa is a cook. David and Keith, now a reluctant security guard, are in therapy to find a healthy relationship, and David is advised to find an activity for himself so applies to the Gay Men's Chorus. Claire is attending LAC, enjoying it less than she anticipated, and starting a relationship with rock-band member Phil.

Claire is painting and has a one-night-stand with a rock and roll guitar player of a garage band.\u2014Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil", "Nate undergoes his brain surgery and has several previews of what his life might have been like, both pre- and post-surgery. Seven months after surgery, he's living with Lisa who is still working as a cook for her ditsy and demanding employer. Their little girl, Maya, is doing just fine and her doting grandmother is more than happy to help out - which Lisa is finding more than a little annoying. Dave and Keith meanwhile are having couples therapy. He has issues with Keith's angry responses to him and feels worthless when they occur. Claire is attending LAC but finds some of the courses boring. In art class, she's learning how to draw a perfect circle freehand.
