Unable to get any transportation services, Nate chooses to fly to Seattle and stay at his ex-roommate Lisa Kemmel's, then transport him by rental-car, offering to take Claire along for the ride (and to help drive). David is stuck sitting Taylor for Keith when he's stuck on assignment for several hours, annoying Rico and causing Ruth, now trying to contact old friends and estranged relatives to discuss their relationships, to remind him he shouldn't be too candid on his gayness with a child still \"developing her blueprints\"...until David advises her to mind her own business and drop the metaphors. Brenda, still fantasizing of seeing other, preferably dangerous and exciting, men, is called to be with her mother in an \"emergency\", only to discover she wanted attention as she stalks then attacks a woman her father is seeing, so has a major confrontation with her for it afterward.

When Dave is unable to arrange for quick transportation, Nate volunteers to fly there, rent a a van and drive back. He even asks Claire to go with him. In Seattle, they stay with his one-time co-worker Lisa Kimmel, who happens to still have feelings for him.
