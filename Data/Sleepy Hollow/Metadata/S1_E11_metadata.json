Mills for help as well as Washington's Bible.", "Moloch wants at all cost Washington's Bible, which presumably contains crucial magical secrets. He demands it as ransom for the captain's daughter, whom he threatens to kidnap and kill by sunset unless it's handed over. Carne, who has it, resists girlish pressure to switch into modern 'camouflage' dress. Having learned from the late sheriff's archive that Abbie's sister was possessed by a body-hopping demon, Ichabod foresees that the captain's family hiding in a safe house is futile and takes cunning precautions. Indeed, the demon possesses cop after cop, for some fatally, to get hold of the girl.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "3387360", "rating": 7.8, "votes": 892, "number_of_episodes": 62}
