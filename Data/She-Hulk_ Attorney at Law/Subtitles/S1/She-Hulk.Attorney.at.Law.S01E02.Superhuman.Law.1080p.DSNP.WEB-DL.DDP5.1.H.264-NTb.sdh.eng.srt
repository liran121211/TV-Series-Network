With seven soulmates that I met
through the prison pen pal program

343
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:32,541
that I want to start a new life with.

344
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,000
Wow.
So,

345
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:37,666
let's talk about the elephant in the room,
shall we?

346
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:41,000
Your cousin.

347
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,875
The Hulk.
My cousin, Bruce.

348
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:48,250
Semantics. He was the Hulk, wasn't he?

349
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:51,041
You know, I tried to kill him, you know.

350
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:52,791
So let's get that out of the way.

351
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:55,083
It wasn't personal or anything. So...

352
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:59,333
I was under direct orders
from your government.

353
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:03,166
But then you went on a destructive 
rampage in Harlem.

354
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,041
That wasn't sanctioned by the government.

355
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:08,500
Yeah, because they pumped me
full of that Super Soldier Serum.

356
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:13,250
The serum the government gave you
caused your subsequent actions?

357
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:17,166
I was a highly decorated soldier.

358
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:22,333
You know, I was sent on a mission
to take out a threat,

359
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:26,625
and I thought I was the good guy,
you know?

360
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,291
I thought I was gonna be, you know...

361
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:33,958
Captain bloody America or something,
you know?

362
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:38,625
And now, that very threat, your cousin,

363
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:43,208
is held up as some kind of hero,
and I'm locked up in here.

364
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,166
Where's the justice in that, Jen?

365
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,208
I understand your point.

366
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:54,083
But the parole board's gonna need to know
that you feel remorse for your actions

367
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,583
to even consider release.

368
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,875
Absolutely, I do, you see.

369
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:00,125

purchased for me by my seven soulmates.

take on Emil Blonsky as a client.

talking to you first.

It doesn't seem like you hold a grudge,
