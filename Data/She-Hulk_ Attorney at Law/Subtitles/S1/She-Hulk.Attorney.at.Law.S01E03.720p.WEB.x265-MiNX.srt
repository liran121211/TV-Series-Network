We are here today to determine
whether Emil Blonsky is

185
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:29,550
suitable for return to society
after having served his minimum sentence.

186
00:10:29,925 --> 00:10:32,467
In light of recent evidence
of a prison escape,

187
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:35,467
I think we all know how this is gonna go.
So, let's keep this brief.

188
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:39,884
As Mr. Blonsky's counsel, I would love to
address the alleged prison escape.

189
00:10:39,967 --> 00:10:41,425
We do have a witness

190
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:45,050
who is able to clear Mr. Blonsky
of any wrongdoing on his part.

191
00:10:45,134 --> 00:10:46,675
Then we'll start with that then.

192
00:10:47,342 --> 00:10:51,967
Well, yes, the witness is prepared
to give a statement

193
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,467
after Mr. Blonsky gives his.

194
00:10:55,134 --> 00:10:57,592
<b><font color="#cf685c">MAN:</font></b> Are we really entertaining

00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:04,717
Now hold on. Mr. Blonsky,
do you feel you have been rehabilitated?

197
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,134
Uh...

198
00:11:09,425 --> 00:11:14,384
Let's start by saying
that I feel great remorse,

199
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,884
great shame to those that I've harmed.

200
00:11:18,425 --> 00:11:21,967
So, to answer your question,
yes, I feel I have been rehabilitated.

201
00:11:22,717 --> 00:11:28,175
I've spent every day of my incarceration
focused solely on redemption.

202
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:30,175
I have changed.

203
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,134
Emotionally, physically,
metaphysically, spiritually,

204
00:11:34,217 --> 00:11:36,925
karmically, cosmically,
inter-dimensionally...

205
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:38,342
Et cetera.

206
00:11:38,425 --> 00:11:42,217
What Mr. Blonsky is trying to say
is that the man you see before you

207
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,967
is not the same Emil Blonsky as before.

208
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:48,175
All he wants now
is to be a contributing member of society.

209
00:11:48,259 --> 00:11:51,175
If released,
would you have a place to live?

210
00:11:51,259 --> 00:11:53,384
Yeah. You can rely on that.

211
00:11:54,592 --> 00:11:58,967
Mr. Blonsky does own a plot of land
on which he plans to work and reside.

212
00:11:59,675 --> 00:12:01,092
He's going into farming?

213
00:12:01,175 --> 00:12:05,800
No. Actually, he plans to open
a meditation retreat on the property.

214
00:12:05,884 --> 00:12:08,300
So, just very... Well, you know...

215
00:12:08,384 --> 00:12:13,009
And how does Mr. Blonsky
intend to fund this endeavor?

216
00:12:14,425 --> 00:12:16,509
Mr. Blonsky is currently

217
00:12:16,592 --> 00:12:20,259
in a long-term committed relationship
with several pen pals.

218
00:12:20,342 --> 00:12:23,717
All of whom have pledged
to financially support him.

219
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,384
Excuse me. If I could...

220
00:12:25,467 --> 00:12:27,842

any further. Any other questions?

226
00:12:52,717 --> 00:12:55,009
Blonsky started the prison's
literacy program.

227
00:12:55,092 --> 00:12:57,342
He's helped countless prisoners
learn how to read.

228
00:12:57,425 --> 00:13:00,634
He leads guided meditation
and yoga for the prisoners.

229

00:14:15,925 --> 00:14:17,009
On what grounds?

251
00:14:17,092 --> 00:14:21,134
Runa is the daughter of an Elfin diplomat
on Asgard and now in New Asgard.

252
00:14:21,217 --> 00:14:23,967
- Did you know about this?
- As such, she has diplomatic immunity.

253
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:28,467
She may have diplomatic immunity in
New Asgard, but we are not in New Asgard.

254

Excuse me, Your Honor,

255
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:35,050
but Asgard is not a place, it is a people.
Therefore, I...

256
00:14:35,134 --> 00:14:38,342
Thor's inspirational speeches
are not admissible in court.

00:14:39,175 --> 00:14:41,050
Your Honor, this case is very cut and dry.

258
00:14:41,134 --> 00:14:45,759
My client was defrauded of $175,000

259
00:14:46,217 --> 00:14:47,467
He deserves compensation

for the financial and emotional trauma
that he's suffered.

261
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:53,134
My client and Mr. Bukowski
were in a consensual relationship

262
00:14:53,217 --> 00:14:55,384
- and engaged in role-play.
- Oh, gross.

I did not.

268
00:15:06,134 --> 00:15:08,967
This was a relationship gone bad,

Mr. Bukowski was blinded by love.

He absolutely believed that he was dating

he chose to return to his cell.

Ladies and gentlemen, I beg you to forgive
Mr. Blonsky's enthusiasm.

322
00:18:01,717 --> 00:18:05,342
He didn't intend to frighten anyone.

323
00:18:06,675 --> 00:18:10,592
In fact, this proves
that in every instance,

324
00:18:10,675 --> 00:18:17,009
Mr. Blonsky could have broken free
but has chosen to remain in his cell.

325
00:18:17,092 --> 00:18:23,092
As his stellar prison record reflects,
Mr. Blonsky spent his entire incarceration

326
00:18:23,175 --> 00:18:27,467
practicing a strict regimen
of training and self-discipline

327
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:30,509
so that he may
walk among his fellow citizens

328
00:18:30,592 --> 00:18:35,592
with no chance of becoming
a rampaging Abomination again.

329
00:18:35,675 --> 00:18:39,717
He deserves a future as a free man
and a productive citizen.

- And as for Mr. Wong...

335
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:59,050
Just "Wong." The Sorcerer Supreme.
Master of the Mystic Arts.

336
00:18:59,134 --> 00:19:01,217
Leader and former librarian of Kamar-Taj.

337
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,217
Yeah. You realize that

338
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:08,092
you've just admitted to facilitating
a prisoner escape, which is a crime.

339

342

What about claims that
you're one of Blonsky's rumored soulmates?

343

- What?

345
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:40,967
That was Jennifer Walters rushing by,
undoubtedly hoping to avoid the protesters

346

that are gathered
just outside the gates here.

347
00:19:43,134 --> 00:19:46,509
And then I get to my car,

"Monster defending a monster."

349

Okay, yeah.
No. I don't want this.

Good God.

- Yeah. No, you're gonna need that.
- Connecting the A and B story. Nice.

How did you two work with him for so long?

Oh, I killed him in my head several times,
in many different ways.

And yet he was convinced
that she had a crush on him.

Trust me.

371
00:20:52,967 --> 00:20:56,425
Ms. Walters, how would you describe
your relationship to Mr. Bukowski?

372
00:20:56,509 --> 00:20:59,550
We worked together for several years
at the DA's office.

373
00:20:59,634 --> 00:21:02,384
Would you say that
you know Mr. Bukowski fairly well?

374
00:21:02,842 --> 00:21:05,925
Definitely. We worked regularly
on cases together,

375
00:21:06,009 --> 00:21:09,925
so I've spent a lot of time
with Mr. Bukowski.

376
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,925
Did he ever share his personal life
with you? Specifically, his dating life.

377
00:21:14,009 --> 00:21:16,925
Yes, he would,
prolifically and unprompted.

378
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:18,217
You wanted to know.

379
00:21:19,259 --> 00:21:23,717
How would you characterize Mr. Bukowski
in relation to his romantic life?

380
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:28,800
Self-absorbed, chauvinistic, conceited.

381
00:21:28,884 --> 00:21:33,592
He once described himself
as a New York 10 and an LA 11.

382
00:21:33,675 --> 00:21:35,050
<b><font color="#ca004b">[LAUGHS]</font></b>

383
00:21:35,509 --> 00:21:38,217
He nicknamed his office the Dennisphere...

384
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,175
Objection.
Relevance.

385
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:44,675
Mr. Bukowski, need I remind you that
you're not representing yourself here?

386
00:21:45,134 --> 00:21:46,759
And this is your witness.

387
00:21:46,842 --> 00:21:50,384
But I agree.
Mr. Pugliese, get to your point.

388
00:21:50,467 --> 00:21:52,967
It's been stated many times
in this courtroom

389
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:55,050
that a man of reasonable intelligence

390
00:21:55,134 --> 00:21:58,300
would never think that he was
dating the real Megan Thee Stallion.

391
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:03,259
In your opinion, Ms. Walters, do you think
that Dennis Bukowski would believe

392
00:22:03,342 --> 00:22:07,134
that he could actually pull
Megan Thee Stallion?

393
00:22:07,217 --> 00:22:12,342
Yes. Dennis Bukowski is
an almost pathologically entitled man.

394
00:22:12,425 --> 00:22:15,717
He would absolutely believe that
he's dating the real Megan Thee Stallion

395
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,884
because he is truly that delusional.

396
00:22:18,592 --> 00:22:20,217
No further questions, Your Honor.

397
00:22:27,092 --> 00:22:32,175
In the case of Bukowski v. Runa,
I award full damages to Dennis Bukowski

398
00:22:32,259 --> 00:22:36,050
in the amount of $175,000.

399
00:22:36,134 --> 00:22:37,259
In addition,

400
00:22:37,342 --> 00:22:43,550
we also sentence the defendant to 60 days
for impersonating a judge.

401
00:22:43,634 --> 00:22:45,300
No, no, no, no, no, no.

402
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,800
That's right.
There's only one Megan Thee Stallion.

403
00:22:47,884 --> 00:22:49,217
Make some noise.

404
00:22:50,217 --> 00:22:51,217
Ah!

405
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:54,425
You guys think I have a shot with
the real Megan Thee Stallion?

406
00:22:54,509 --> 00:22:55,509
Should I go back?

407
00:22:55,592 --> 00:22:58,634
No. No. Please, don't do that.
Thanks for that testimony in there, Jen.

408

It was my pleasure.

409
00:22:59,842 --> 00:23:02,467
The sad part is that elf's just gonna
get a slap on the wrist.

410
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,675
I wish there was a way
we could remove her powers

411
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:07,050
and make sure
she doesn't victimize anyone else.

00:28:56,259 --> 00:28:58,342
Just... Just your signature there.

477
00:28:59,134 --> 00:29:01,800
And then just initial. Good.

478
00:29:01,884 --> 00:29:03,509
And initials up here.

479
00:29:05,217 --> 00:29:06,717
<b><font color="#ca004b">[ELEVATOR DINGS]</font></b>

480
00:29:09,425 --> 00:29:10,675
<b><font color="#ca004b">[HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING]</font></b>

481
00:29:11,967 --> 00:29:13,050
Huh.

482
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:23,217
Oh, you are way more fun
than my last lawyer.

483
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:26,217
- I will kill for you, Megan Thee Stallion.
- Dial it back.
