The Marvel Cinematic Universe is known

412
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:20,609
for its big spectacles
and high-stakes plotlines,

413
00:21:20,692 --> 00:21:24,567
but it's often said that Marvel movies
all end the same way...

414

<i>Wait, who's saying that?</i>

415
00:21:26,275 --> 00:21:29,984
Perhaps, this is a result
of following some unwritten rule

416
00:21:30,067 --> 00:21:33,442
that you have to throw
a bunch of plot, and flash,

417
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:38,150
and a whole blood thing
that seems super suspiciously close

418
00:21:38,234 --> 00:21:41,650
to Super Soldier Serum
at the audience in the climax.

419
00:21:42,525 --> 00:21:44,192
I propose we don't have to do that.

<i>Huh.</i>

421
00:21:45,775 --> 00:21:48,775

which is that my life fell apart

right when I was learning
to be both Jen and She-Hulk.

00:21:53,734 --> 00:21:55,692
Those are my stakes, K.E.V.I.N.

<i>The K-E-V-I-N is processing this new data.</i>

outer space to save the day in my story?

We're done.
I'm sorry.

Oh, man.

Yeah.
Just take it down a notch, Pug.

One sec.

Sure.

Hi, Daredevil.

490
00:24:38,609 --> 00:24:40,442
All right, as your legal counsel,

491
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:44,650
if you sign this, you go back to prison
for ten years for parole violation.

492

Yep. It's the karmic price
I pay for my actions.

Well, maybe you can write
some haikus about it.

Aunt Rebecca, you don't ask people
how much money they make.

It's fine.
I don't do it for the money.
