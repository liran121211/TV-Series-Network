show up to my wedding,

168
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,083
try and trying to kill you
or something.

169
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:43,583
I'm literally just here to celebrate
the love of Lulu and her groom.

170
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,916
-That's all, okay?
-LULU: That's so sweet.

171
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:50,708
Yeah. See?
Not everything is about you, Jennifer.

172
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:51,791
Whatever!

173
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:10,958
-Sorry. I know this is a little weird.
-Oh, sorry.

174
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:14,333
I haven't perfected the least
awkward way to approach a stranger.

175
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,333
JENNIFER: Oh.

176
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:19,041
-Yeah, could use a little work.
-Yeah.

177
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:22,000
Work on that for the next time
I bungle another intro.

178
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,500
-Cool.
-I'm Josh.

179
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,750
-Jen.
-Bride or groom?

180
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,500
-Bride. I went to high school with Lulu.
-Mmm.

181
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,750
-Wow.
-Mmm-hmm.

182
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,375
-You?
-Groom.

183
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:34,958
But it all blends together.

184
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:37,000
-Can I ask you a question?
-Yeah.

185
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:41,500
Did they give you a plus one?
I don't understand how they decided.

186
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:44,875
-Yeah, they didn't, but I don't mind.
-Mmm.

187
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,708
See, my plan was to
strike up a very normal conversation

188
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:50,833
with a beautiful woman
stuffing her face with candied nuts.

189
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:54,166
-Oh!
-I'm very good at sticking to my plans.

190
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,458
-Yeah. I can tell.
-Yeah.

191
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:58,291
Oh, my gosh, Jen.
Oh, my gosh, I'm so happy I found you.

192
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:01,666
Half the staff is quitting
because of "how I'm treating them."

193
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,000
Could you help me
clean up around here?

194
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,875
Straighten up?
Take up some of these empties, tidy up?

195
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,541
I could use your help.
It's on the inside, please?

196
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,291
-Yeah. Yep.
-Thank you, Jen.

197
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,291
-Yeah, yeah.
-See you later.

198
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:14,541
Bye.

199

$75,000 of credit card debt,

200
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:23,333
and Paul conveniently disappears
the day the bill came.

201
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:28,583
Well, I never saw a dime for raising
Spencer Jr. alone for all those years.

202
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:33,041
I spent $10,000
on a New Orleans jazz funeral

203
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:37,083
after Arnie accidentally
swallowed a cyanide pill.

204
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:41,291
Ladies and gentlemen,
I hear you, believe me.

205
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:45,208
Can I ask how you all first became
aware of Mr. Immortal's

206
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,791
pattern of behavior?

207
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,333
It was because of me.

208
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:53,916
My friend sent me a link to a video
posted on that site, Intelligencia.

209
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,583
The one for hateful man babies?

210
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:56,958
Yep, that's the one.

211
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:59,333
You saw this man walk into

212
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:03,041
a busy intersection and then he gets
hit by four different cars.

213
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:06,833
His body regenerates and then
he just gets up and walks away.

214
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:11,333
I, of course, immediately recognized
my idiot husband, Roger.

I was worried about.

217
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:20,666
Not only did you
fake your own death multiple times,

218
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,083
but you also forged
multiple fake identities.

219
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:27,208
Frankly, all of these spouses
should be filing criminal charges.

220
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:29,250
You are lucky you're not in prison.

221

223
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,500
I'll get you the best deal
under the circumstances.

224
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:39,750
-Thank you.
-Don't touch me.

225
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:43,250
But let me tell you this.
You're gonna have to pay.

226
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,000
Why are you smiling?

227
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:46,625
It's kinda fun.

228
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,916
HEATHER: No, she'll totally do it.
This is such a Jen job.

229

I make her do stuff like this.

00:12:56,333 --> 00:13:01,500
Oh! Hey! So, the groomsmen
were playing <i>Mario Kart</i>

231
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,125
and their shirts got wrinkled.

JENNIFER: Oh, my God,
from a video game?

233
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:08,791
Yeah. Video games are sports now.
They're on ESPN and everything.

234
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:11,750
-Yeah.
-So you're on ironing duty, right?

-I am?
-Yeah. Go bride squad!

236
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,583
Thank you so much. Amazing.

We had to resuscitate him this morning.

Ladies, Sebastian, how about this?

244
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:41,625
I still have all of those
Apple shares I bought in 1981,

245
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:45,416
plus all the gold left to me
by my first wife, Baroness Cromwell.

246
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,500
How about we split it evenly,
eight ways, and call it a day?

247
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,291
-Very fair.
-Generous and fair.

248
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,500
Then everyone
can move on with their lives.

249
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,666
I will draw up
the paperwork immediately

250

-Just a minute.

00:13:57,458 --> 00:14:01,250
We were married for 18 years
and she was only with him for three.

252
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,083
Why should she get the same amount?

253
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:05,750
Because I had a kid with this fool.

254
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:09,833
-Why should I be punished for her mistake?
-My son is not a mistake.

255
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,500
