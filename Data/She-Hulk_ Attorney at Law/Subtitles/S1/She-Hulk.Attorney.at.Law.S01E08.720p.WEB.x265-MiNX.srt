Luke Jacobson.

Mr. Patilio, Sr.

a conflict waiver

to have you, Ms. Walters.

65
00:03:36,558 --> 00:03:39,100

ethically compromised

You've handled a client

is a lot more personal than this one.

Yes, and I would love

come to an agreement with Mr. Jacobson

Hey. Sorry I'm late.

As a first point of order,
I'd like to ask that

123
00:06:35,725 --> 00:06:39,433
the motion to compel production of
the defendant's client list be rejected

124
00:06:39,516 --> 00:06:41,475
as it's not relevant to the litigation.

this information to be incredibly relevant

given the nature of the complaint.

128
00:06:48,391 --> 00:06:51,975
There could be multiple instances
of Mr. Jacobson's other clients

sustaining injuries
from faulty merchandise.

130
00:06:54,308 --> 00:06:56,808
I believe Ms. Walters will find that
Mr. Jacobson's record

131
00:06:56,891 --> 00:06:59,433
as it pertains to customer satisfaction
to be spotless.

132
00:06:59,516 --> 00:07:03,350
If the defendant has nothing to hide,
then why not hear from his clients?

133
00:07:03,433 --> 00:07:06,475
That's an invasion of privacy
based on a very shaky "what if."

134
00:07:06,558 --> 00:07:09,808
This is a very common procedure
in product liability lawsuits.

135
00:07:09,891 --> 00:07:11,391
It is material to the case whether

136
00:07:11,475 --> 00:07:14,016
this type of malfunction
has affected other people.

137
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,058
There is no inherent right to privacy

when employing Mr. Jacobson's tailoring services.

139
00:07:18,683 --> 00:07:20,600
We're not just talking about a product here.

140
00:07:20,683 --> 00:07:22,600
The very nature of Mr. Jacobson's line of work,

141
00:07:22,683 --> 00:07:26,266
making suits exclusively for superheroes,
necessitates anonymity.

142
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:29,016
May I remind you that
the Sokovia Accords have been repealed.

143
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,391
Superheroes operate in the public eye.

144
00:07:32,475 --> 00:07:37,975
As public figures, it is assumed that
there will be some loss of privacy.

145
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:40,225
We're not talking about celebrities,

146
00:07:40,308 --> 00:07:43,141
but superheroes who have
enemies who will try to harm them,

147
00:07:43,225 --> 00:07:44,391
and people close to them.

148
00:07:44,475 --> 00:07:46,683
The ones who didn't ask
to be a part of this life.

149
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,183
Ms. Walters chose
to have her identity be public,

150
00:07:49,266 --> 00:07:51,141
but she can't choose for everyone else.

151
00:07:51,225 --> 00:07:53,225
This isn't about
privacy for privacy's sake.

152

If this information is not protected,
not only would it ruin my client's career,

00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,266

Come on.

486
00:26:31,475 --> 00:26:32,891
Educated.

487
00:26:32,975 --> 00:26:34,475
Accomplished.

488
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:35,725
Beautiful.

489
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:39,975
And doing everything regular lawyers do,
except backwards,

Now tell us,
what's it like being a female lawyer?

So special and empowering.
I love it.

Twice the work, half the recognition,

502
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,141
