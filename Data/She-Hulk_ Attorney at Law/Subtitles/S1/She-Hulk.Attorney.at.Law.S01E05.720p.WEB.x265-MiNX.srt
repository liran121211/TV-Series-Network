No.

Why did I pass a billboard

177
00:09:56,675 --> 00:10:01,133
advertising a She-Hulk
booty boost smoothie?

178

Oh, so, that's not actually me.

179
00:10:06,091 --> 00:10:09,550
So that name
was never really mine, officially.

180

Everyone in the media
just started calling me that.

Uh, yeah, I'm gonna stop you,

Okay.

184
00:10:23,758 --> 00:10:26,466
GLK and H made She-Hulk the face

And now, we find ourselves
in the middle of a frivolous lawsuit.

195

I'm the attorney, you're the client.
That's the only way this can work.

Agreed.

Why didn't you trademark your pseudonym?

199
00:11:06,925 --> 00:11:10,591
I never even thought about it, you know?
Why would I?

200
00:11:10,675 --> 00:11:13,925
Did Doctor Strange have to trademark his name?
Did Thor?

201
00:11:14,008 --> 00:11:16,716
You chose two examples
of people who use their real names.

202
00:11:17,383 --> 00:11:18,591
Mmm-hmm.

203
00:11:21,508 --> 00:11:24,050
This is the person
who legally outmaneuvered you?

204
00:11:24,508 --> 00:11:25,508
Yeah.

205
00:11:26,716 --> 00:11:27,800
Yeah.

206
00:11:30,466 --> 00:11:32,716
We need to show strength.
Countersue.

207
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,341
Establish you were using the name

208
00:11:34,425 --> 00:11:36,966
in a professional capacity
before the trademark date,

209
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:39,175
and Titania is profiting
off name recognition

210
00:11:39,258 --> 00:11:41,091
already established in the marketplace.

211
00:11:41,175 --> 00:11:44,050
If you're gonna be my client,
dress like you respect yourself,

212
00:11:44,133 --> 00:11:46,883
and not like a football player
pleading no contest to a DUI.

213
00:11:46,966 --> 00:11:47,966
Nikki?

214
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:51,550
Yes? Wasn't lurking.
I was close by.

215

- I'm actually already on top of that.

I got you a consultation with the guy

Your Honor, we move to dismiss

00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,133
My client owns the trademark for She-Hulk.

225
00:12:28,216 --> 00:12:30,925
Ms. Book may enjoy
wasting the court's time,

226
00:12:31,008 --> 00:12:33,133
but you can be certain that I do not.

227
00:12:33,258 --> 00:12:34,383
Ms. Book?

228
00:12:34,466 --> 00:12:35,758
Thank you, Your Honor.

229
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,675
As you will see,
there are no issues of fact here

230
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,883
that would require proceeding to trial.

231
00:12:41,175 --> 00:12:45,550
Since the first public appearance
of Jennifer Walters in her Hulk form,

232
00:12:45,633 --> 00:12:51,341
the public has unanimously identified her
with the name She-Hulk.

233
00:12:51,466 --> 00:12:54,341
In fact, the name had not even
been recorded

234
00:12:54,425 --> 00:12:56,633
in public discourse until that debut.

235
00:12:57,383 --> 00:12:59,758
We have a number of news items
and broadcast quotes

236
00:12:59,841 --> 00:13:01,675
I'd like to enter into record.

237
00:13:02,508 --> 00:13:03,591
Simply put,

238
00:13:04,341 --> 00:13:07,258
the defendant is exploiting goodwill
towards my client

239
00:13:07,341 --> 00:13:08,758
and her better-known cousin,

240
00:13:08,841 --> 00:13:13,675
in order to sell
her non-FDA approved sham products.

241
00:13:14,216 --> 00:13:16,050
We ask the court to grant our motion

242
00:13:16,133 --> 00:13:18,883
for summary judgment,
and order our requested remedies.

243
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:21,300
Okay.

244
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,216
First of all, "sham"?

245
00:13:23,841 --> 00:13:27,216
Why don't you try telling that
to the thousands of testimonials

246
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,300

but amazing results

Actually, yes.
We have one more clip to show.

with the name She-Hulk?</i>

- She-Hulk!

324
00:17:28,216 --> 00:17:29,550
Didn't know you worked here.

325
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:31,300
Yeah! Are you a client, or...

326
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,258
I am.
I'm one of the biggest.

327
00:17:33,341 --> 00:17:35,633
Just had a meeting with
my favorite lady lawyer.

328
00:17:35,716 --> 00:17:36,716
No touching.

329
00:17:37,466 --> 00:17:38,716
We should, um...

330
00:17:39,633 --> 00:17:41,091
Yeah, we should reconnect soon.

331
00:17:41,175 --> 00:17:43,966
- Absolutely. That would be great.
- Yeah. Drinks on me.

332
00:17:45,425 --> 00:17:46,425
Okay.

333
00:17:49,841 --> 00:17:53,216
- You rolled over so quickly.
- So quickly.

334
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,258
- But the drinks are on him.
- So quickly.

335
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:56,341
See you outside in ten.

336
00:17:57,216 --> 00:18:00,675
Yeah, and you looked at that guy's
dating profile and you were like,

337
00:18:00,758 --> 00:18:03,591
"I'll give him a couple
of precious hours of my life."

338
00:18:03,675 --> 00:18:06,008
And I sat across...
No, She-Hulk.

339
00:18:07,383 --> 00:18:10,175
She-Hulk sat across from him
for an entire dinner.

340
00:18:10,258 --> 00:18:12,925
Yeah, and he for sure
is telling all his friends like,

341
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,925
"Yo, bro.
Went on a date with She-Hulk."

342
00:18:15,008 --> 00:18:17,008
- Oh, my God.
- What?

343
00:18:17,175 --> 00:18:18,633
He went on a date with She-Hulk.

344
00:18:19,175 --> 00:18:20,341
Yeah.

345
00:18:20,425 --> 00:18:23,341
Because I made a dating profile
as She-Hulk,

346
00:18:23,425 --> 00:18:28,466
and went on several dates as She-Hulk,
showing a clear pattern of using the name.

347
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:32,133
Every single one of those dates
is a corroborating witness. This...

348
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:35,175
Is how I win this case.

349
00:18:35,258 --> 00:18:38,175
By parading all the questionable men
you dated in a courtroom.

350
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:41,175
- Jen, that's going to be embarrassing.
- Yeah.

351

<b><font color="#ca004b">[GAVEL BANGS]</font></b>

352
00:18:51,133 --> 00:18:52,216
Ms. Book.

353
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:56,800
Your Honor, we have compelling evidence
my client did in fact self-identify

354
00:18:56,883 --> 00:18:58,341
with the moniker She-Hulk

355
00:18:58,425 --> 00:19:00,633
well before Titania filed
for the trademark.

356
00:19:00,716 --> 00:19:01,716
Please proceed.

357
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:04,341
My client used "She-Hulk,"

358
00:19:05,008 --> 00:19:08,216
not as a name to exploit
in order to sell product,

359
00:19:08,966 --> 00:19:10,758
but as a genuine part of her identity.

360
00:19:12,216 --> 00:19:16,800
As you can see in the "About Me" section,
my client wrote, and I quote,

361
00:19:16,883 --> 00:19:20,258
"Mean, green and straight-poured
into these jeans."

362
00:19:20,341 --> 00:19:21,425
Ew.

363
00:19:21,633 --> 00:19:24,800
And to answer the question,
"What are you looking for in a partner?"

364
00:19:24,883 --> 00:19:25,966
my client wrote,

365
00:19:26,883 --> 00:19:30,716
"A sturdy back
and reinforced king-size bed.

366
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,091
"JK. JK. JK."

367
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,633
We'd like to call our witnesses.

368
00:19:42,175 --> 00:19:43,341
'Sup?

369
00:19:45,175 --> 00:19:48,466
Yeah, she's like, "It's me.
The real She-Hulk. Impressed much?"

370
00:19:49,341 --> 00:19:51,258
She came across a little tryhard,
to be honest.

371
00:19:52,216 --> 00:19:53,425
I'm just not about that.

372
00:19:54,633 --> 00:19:58,675
I specifically remember her
referring to herself as She-Hulk,

373
00:19:59,383 --> 00:20:02,675
in the third person,
and as a writer myself,

374
00:20:02,758 --> 00:20:04,133
I found that grating.

375
00:20:05,091 --> 00:20:06,508
<b><font color="#cf685c">TODD:</font></b> Yeah, no, she confided in me

376
00:20:06,591 --> 00:20:09,341
that she was initially embarrassed
by the name She-Hulk.

377
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:11,300
But then she embraced it.

378
00:20:11,383 --> 00:20:12,633
That's the beautiful part.

379
00:20:12,716 --> 00:20:15,508
I guess I'm the kind of guy
a woman can really open up to.

380
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:19,758
So you would say
you really connected with She-Hulk?

381
00:20:19,841 --> 00:20:23,716
She-Hulk and I had an intense connection.

382
00:20:24,758 --> 00:20:25,966
We had a great date.

383
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:28,300
She battled demons, I mean, come on.

384
00:20:30,383 --> 00:20:32,550
Would you have gone on the date

385
00:20:33,133 --> 00:20:36,883
if She-Hulk had instead presented
as Jennifer Walters?

I don't mean to be rude, but...

No.

388
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:45,716
She's not really my type.

00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:50,550
But She-Hulk. She-Hulk's incredible.
She's amazing.

390
00:20:55,508 --> 00:21:00,466
In light of this new testimony,
the court finds in favor of...

391
00:21:01,133 --> 00:21:03,925
Jennifer Walters, aka She-Hulk.

392
00:21:04,008 --> 00:21:06,675
Motion for summary judgement is granted.

393
00:21:06,925 --> 00:21:10,258
Titania and her subsidiaries
will cease usage

394
00:21:10,341 --> 00:21:12,800
of the She-Hulk name
effective immediately.

395

that way to win a case.

Yeah, you can always count on me

He couldn't have gone through that.
