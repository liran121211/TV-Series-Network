Uh, Jen, that Hawkeye guy,

164
00:07:42,325 --> 00:07:45,117
what happens to those arrows of his?

165
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,033

166

- Jenny.
- Nobody calls me that.

324
00:16:44,325 --> 00:16:45,367
Well,

325
00:16:46,367 --> 00:16:49,033
first off, namaste.

326
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:52,075
Mr. Blonsky, I was expecting...

327
00:16:52,158 --> 00:16:53,867
- Abomination, right?
- Yes.

328
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:55,093
- Yeah, well...

No, you won't be seeing much of him about.

332
00:17:00,242 --> 00:17:03,325
Honestly, I've completely
transformed myself,

333
00:17:04,033 --> 00:17:06,867
you know, physically, obviously,

334
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:09,242
but also spiritually.

335
00:17:09,325 --> 00:17:13,117
Does that mean that you can't turn into
the Abomination anymore, or you won't?

336
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,117
No, no, it means that I choose not to.

337
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,783
I'm simply Emil now.

338
00:17:18,867 --> 00:17:21,117
Russian born, British raised,

339
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,158
Royal Marines commando,

340
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:25,325
on loan to the US government.

341
00:17:25,492 --> 00:17:26,492
Okay.

342
00:17:26,575 --> 00:17:30,450
With seven soulmates that I met
through the prison pen pal program

343
00:17:30,533 --> 00:17:32,533
that I want to start a new life with.

344
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:34,992
- Wow.
- So,

345
00:17:35,075 --> 00:17:37,658
let's talk about the elephant in the room,
shall we?

346
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:40,992
Your cousin.

347
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,867
- The Hulk.
- My cousin, Bruce.

348
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:48,242
Semantics.
He was the Hulk, wasn't he?

349
00:17:48,325 --> 00:17:51,033
You know, I tried to kill him, you know.

350
00:17:51,117 --> 00:17:52,783
So let's get that out of the way.

351
00:17:52,867 --> 00:17:55,075
It wasn't personal or anything.
So...

352
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:59,325
I was under direct orders
from your government.

353
00:17:59,408 --> 00:18:03,158
But then you went on
a destructive rampage in Harlem.

354
00:18:03,242 --> 00:18:05,033
That wasn't sanctioned by the government.

355
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:08,492
Yeah, because they pumped me
full of that Super Soldier Serum.

356
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:13,242
The serum the government gave you
caused your subsequent actions?

357
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:17,158
I was a highly decorated soldier.

358
00:18:17,242 --> 00:18:22,325
You know, I was sent on a mission
to take out a threat,

359
00:18:22,408 --> 00:18:26,617
and I thought I was the good guy,
you know?

360
00:18:27,075 --> 00:18:29,283
I thought I was gonna be, you know...

361
00:18:30,825 --> 00:18:33,950
Captain bloody America or something,
you know?

362
00:18:34,033 --> 00:18:38,617
And now, that very threat, your cousin,

363
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:43,200
is held up as some kind of hero,
and I'm locked up in here.

364
00:18:45,367 --> 00:18:47,158
Where's the justice in that, Jen?

365
00:18:48,617 --> 00:18:50,200
I understand your point.

366
00:18:50,283 --> 00:18:54,075
But the parole board's gonna need to know
that you feel remorse for your actions

367
00:18:54,158 --> 00:18:55,575
to even consider release.

368
00:18:56,325 --> 00:18:57,867
Absolutely, I do, you see.

369
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:00,117

370

- Oh, boy.

00:19:04,117 --> 00:19:06,117
...to each of my victims

372
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,908
expressing the sorrow.

373
00:19:08,992 --> 00:19:10,759
- You don't...
- If you'd like to experience them.

I would advise you to

speak truthfully, from the heart,

378
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:22,367
instead of trying to gauge
what you think they might wanna hear.

379

That's all from the heart, Jen.

that he's reformed, you know?
