No. Okay, so,
over there is the Wood Lodge

a desk and some Wi-Fi.

Last session, we really explored
Alejandro's struggles with his identity.

200
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:46,750
Just because I am Spanish
and I have a flair for the style,

201
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:49,620
people constantly assume
that I am a matador.

202
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,040
It's dehumanizing.

203
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,500
Spanish is a language,
not a nationality, so...

204
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,500
You've never heard of Spain?

205
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:59,160
It's not your fault,
but those attributes make me

206
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,540
see you as a matador.

207
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,620
And, well, that's triggering for me.

208
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,750
I did do some light matadoring in college.

Dude, what?

320
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:02,370
We have to consider the very real
possibility that you were ghosted.

321
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:04,120
- Or he wanted your blood.
- No, not that.

322
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,080
Don't talk about blood.
We're not your dad.

323
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,290
Don't talk about my dad.

324
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:08,700
<i>Hermanos,</i> please.

325
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,290
Jen, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to talk so...

326
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:16,410
No.

327
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:22,500
I met him when I was Jen,
and he liked Jen.

328
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:25,290
He specifically didn't ask about She-Hulk.

329
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:34,040
You know in high-school that friend
you have that's like, cooler than you are?

330
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:38,700
Like, more attractive and athletic.
They get all the attention from everyone.

331
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:42,870
Hello.

332
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:49,500
Like, you think life would be
so much easier if I were that person,

333
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:55,540
and I can turn into that person
anytime I want to.

334
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,330
And everyone pays attention when I'm this.

335
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:03,700
Like, my colleagues, my boss, guys.

336
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,950
But it feels like cheating

337
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:14,870
because would they like me
if I didn't have all of this?

338
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:19,660
Like, if I was just Jen,
would the same guys who like She-Hulk

339
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:24,540
stick around for Jen?
Because some of them don't.

340
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:30,080
And that sucks for Jen
because Jen is great,

341
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,160
and no one cares when they're She-Hulk.

342
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:37,120
So, like, I meet this guy
who actually likes Jen,

343
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,160
and that just felt good
to know that, you know?

344
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:44,330
And then, he ghosts me and it sucks.

345
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,290
Screw this guy!
Where does he live?

346
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,290
Let's kill him.
He's gotta die.

347
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:54,410
Big men, please.

348
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,580
No. Man-Bull's correct.

349
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:59,000
Josh has made
an enemy of this entire group.

350
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,330
Tonight, we ride!

351
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:02,620
That's awesome!

352
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,830
Alejandro, you've been warned about using
bio-electricity in group before.

353
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:07,950
Sorry.

354
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,450
Let's find this Josh guy
and suck out all his blood.

355
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,580

356
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:15,290

- No, wait, guys! Wait! Jen is hurting,

357
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,580
and all we can offer her is violence?

358
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:24,830
Does anyone think
they could speak to Jen's pain

359
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,910
with the tools
that we've learned in the group?

360
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:32,870
Well, for one thing, I'd say
you can't control what others do.

361
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,410
It hurts when someone rejects us

362
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:40,910
because it reminds us
of the times we reject ourselves.

363
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,370
Maybe this Josh thing hurts so much

364
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:46,290
'cause you haven't been spending
enough time with Jen.

365
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:51,500
And that's a shame
because I bet Jen is pretty damn great...

366
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,080
- Yeah.
- ...and tasty.

367
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,200
Went off the rails.

368
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,950
- Somebody bail me out.
- Maybe...

369
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:00,040
just maybe this Josh isn't the only guy
who likes Jen Walters.

370
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,830
Maybe, there's a group of guys
right here

371
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:05,700
who would love to spend time
with Jen right now.

372
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:07,450

genuinely values the whole of you?

00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,700
- I do.
- And there it is.

375
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:25,580
So maybe, you can stop using She-Hulk
as a protective shield

376
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:28,080
