He's a former student of the Mystic Arts

when he summoned three kegs

109
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:51,375

- Not mystic. Not a castle. Got it.

Recently, Donny has been using
our sacred teachings in his shows,

114
00:07:04,542 --> 00:07:08,083
sending volunteers into
other realms for casual fun.

115
00:07:08,167 --> 00:07:11,417
But he barely has a grasp of the basics
of inter-dimensional portaling.

116
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:16,208
Practicing the Mystic Arts without
proper training not only endangers people,

117
00:07:16,292 --> 00:07:19,542
it risks untangling the material

Students pledge themselves to be
loyal servants of the Mystic Arts.

126
00:07:41,292 --> 00:07:43,708
- And did you get that in writing?
- No.
