00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,666
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

122
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,666
As a first point of order,
I'd like to ask that

123
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,458
the motion to compel production of
the defendant's client list be rejected

124
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:41,500
as it's not relevant to the litigation.

125
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,958
Who's this asshole?

126
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:46,541
Your Honor, I believe
this information to be incredibly relevant

127
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,333
given the nature of the complaint.

128
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:52,000
There could be multiple instances
of Mr. Jacobson's other clients

129
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,250
sustaining injuries
from faulty merchandise.

130
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,833
I believe Ms. Walters will find that
Mr. Jacobson's record

131
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,458
as it pertains to customer satisfaction
to be spotless.

132
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:03,375
If the defendant has nothing to hide,
then why not hear from his clients?

133
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:06,500
That's an invasion of privacy
based on a very shaky "what if."

134
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,833
This is a very common procedure
in product liability lawsuits.

135
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,416
It is material to the case whether

136
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,041
this type of malfunction
has affected other people.

137
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,083
There is no inherent right to privacy

00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,625
when employing
Mr. Jacobson's tailoring services.

00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,625
We're not just
talking about a product here.

140
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,625
The very nature
of Mr. Jacobson's line of work,

141
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:26,291
making suits exclusively for superheroes,
necessitates anonymity.

142
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:29,041
May I remind you that
the Sokovia Accords have been repealed.

143
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:32,416
Superheroes operate in the public eye.

144
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:38,000
As public figures, it is assumed that
there will be some loss of privacy.

145
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,250
We're not talking about celebrities,

146
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,166
but superheroes who have
enemies who will try to harm them,

147
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,416
and people close to them.

148
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,708
The ones who didn't ask
to be a part of this life.

149
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:49,208
Ms. Walters chose
to have her identity be public,

150
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,166
but she can't choose for everyone else.

151
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,250
This isn't about
privacy for privacy's sake.

152
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:57,041
If this information is not protected,
not only would it ruin my client's career,

153
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:59,291
it could put a lot of people
in a lot of danger,

154
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,458
and all over one man's misuse of a suit.

155
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,500
JUDGE PRICE: I'm in agreement
with Mr. Murdock.

156
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,166
Motion to compel discovery is denied.

157
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,541
Wait. Does that mean
I don't get a new suit?

158
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:10,708
Sit down!

159
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,625
What, no... Look at this thing!

160
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,625

162
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:19,500
Mr. Patilio, what kind of fuel
did you use in your boosters?

163
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,583
Jet fuel.

164
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:24,083
Wait a minute,
you used jet fuel in your boosters?

165
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,375
Because that's not
what my instructions said.

166
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:27,500
What?

167
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,375
Uh... (CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY)

00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,500
No, I didn't.

00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,666
He's lying.
Don't ask me how I know, I just know.

170
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,083
Yes, we can all tell he's lying,
Mr. Murdock.

171
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:40,625
If the plaintiff ignored
the manufacturer's explicit instructions,

is absolved of all liability.

No, but I would like you to.

go back to you being my tailor?

for a product liability case?

194
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:49,208
Luke Jacobson made a couple of
new suits for me, so I owed him one.

have you been checking up on me?

Yeah. Can you blame me?
You came out of nowhere

202
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,166
and you made my dumb client admit

203
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,625
to being even dumber
than I thought he was in court.

- Well, I'll give you one guess.
- Okay.

It rhymes with "rich parents."

- Wait, I said it was rich parents.

The "us" part.
