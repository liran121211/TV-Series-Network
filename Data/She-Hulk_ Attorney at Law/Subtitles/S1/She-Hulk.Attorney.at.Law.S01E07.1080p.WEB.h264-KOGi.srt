1
00:00:01,708 --> 00:00:04,666
<i>Your first case</i>
<i>is the parole of Emil Blonsky.</i>

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:07,333
<i>Also known as Abomination.</i>

3
00:00:07,416 --> 00:00:09,500
Jennifer Walters. <i>Namaste.</i>

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,666
<i>Previously on</i> She-Hulk...

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,791
The man you see before you
is not the same Emil Blonsky.

6
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:17,875
He plans to open a meditation retreat.

7
00:00:17,958 --> 00:00:21,708
We hereby grant Mr. Blonsky's release
on parole, effective immediately.

8
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:24,625
Mr. Blonsky is prohibited from
turning into Abomination

9
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:27,333
and is ordered
to wear an inhibitor in perpetuity.

10
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:28,666
I'm Josh.

11
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:29,750
Jen.

12
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:33,083
<i>My plan was to strike up a normal</i>
<i>conversation with a beautiful woman.</i>

13
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,333
<i>She-Hulk is amazing.</i>

14
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,958
I just wanted to be amazing tonight.

15
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:39,666
I don't know. I think you're pretty great.

16
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,583
- Some of these are death threats.
- Best thing to do is ignore it.

17
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:45,958
Just let her live her life.

18
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:42,791
-Bye.
-I'll text you.

19
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:45,916
The client's insurance policy
covers acts of God.

20
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,125
Okay. Good night.

21
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:29,458
<i>Sometimes in life, </i>
<i>you just gotta go for what you want.</i>

22
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:31,000
<i>And you are what I want.</i>

23
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,416
<i>Jen!</i>

24
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,500
You didn't tell me you were nominated
for Female Lawyer of The Year.

25
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:46,125
Does this mean we get to go to a gala?

26
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:53,166
Hello? Oh, oh, are you going down
a rabbit hole on that Intelligencia site?

27
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,291
What? No.

28
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:57,125
I don't care what a bunch of losers
say about me online.

29
00:04:57,208 --> 00:05:02,083
Can't even say it to my face
'cause they know they'd get Hulk-smashed.

30
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:05,833
-No, I'm waiting for a text from Josh.
-What? Okay. That's enough for you.

31
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:08,375
You need to set a limit
so you stop checking that.

32
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:09,958
-What about just hourly?
-No.

33
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:13,750
It's just the first 12 hours after you
sleep with someone for the first time.

34
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:14,833
It just feels icky.

35
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:17,791
You just gotta coast through it
without doing anything stupid.

36
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:21,541
Why can't he just text me back?
Why is that so hard?

37
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:24,375
There's no reason nowadays
to not respond to a text.

38
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:29,000
He could be in a meeting or at the movies.

39
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:32,875
There's weddings, funerals,
job interviews, silent retreats.

40
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,000
I hope he's at all of those today.

41
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:40,541
Hello?

42
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,375
Jennifer Walters.

43
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:43,500
Chuck Donelan.

44
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,125
<i>Emil Blonsky's parole officer.</i>

45
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:46,750
Chuck? How are you?

46
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:50,333
Um... I can't imagine you calling me
on a Sunday is good news.

47
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:51,416
<i>Got that right.</i>

48
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,958
We got a malfunction alert
on Blonsky's inhibitor.

49
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,000
Oh, did he turn into The Abomination?

50
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,166
<i>We don't know,</i>

51
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,958
so I gotta go up
to that wackadoo ranch of his.

52
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:05,208
Okay. Well, I'll check in with him.

53
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:09,083
Well, you have danced
right on over to why I called.

54
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:12,416
We don't have the resources
for a squad of uniforms to go with me,

55
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,291
so I was hoping you'd meet me there.

56
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,083
<i>Just in case, you know...</i>

57
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:23,000
In case The Abomination
decides not to cooperate.

58
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:26,083
Yeah. My chances of staying out of the ICU
would be much greater

59
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,333
-if I had a Hulk with me.
-Mmm-hmm.

60
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,791
I'm not interrupting your plans, am I?

61
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:37,333
No. Not at all. Nope.
I will see you there.

62
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:40,791
<i>Great, 'cause the place is full of weirdos</i>
<i>and I don't wanna be...</i>

63
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:19,125
Hey, Jen! Jen, Jen. Wait!
Wait, wait, wait. Jen, wait for me!

64
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,041
Hey, Jen.

65
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:33,625
Thanks, again, for doing this.

66
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,875
Yeah, I mean,
if he's violated his parole,

67
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:37,166
his lawyer should be here.

68
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,541
-Yeah.
-All right.

69
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:42,083
-No, Jen! Jen!
-Are you here? Blonsky!

70
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:45,208
You're honking your horn
at a ten-foot-tall lizard monster.

71
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:48,125
So, maybe, put on your green suit.

72
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,125
-Put on my green suit?
-Yeah.

73
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,791
Get big, Jolly Green yourself?

74
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,583
-What do you call it?
-Hulking out.

75
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,541
Okay. Good. Whatever.
Then, would you? Please?

76
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:01,208
It's definitely malfunctioning.

77
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,666
I don't know why.

78
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,625
Maybe you might've jostled it or...

79
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:09,958
Come to think of it, I did get a jolt
from an electric fence earlier,

80
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:13,333
but it was worth it
because my favorite chicken,

81
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,000
Princess Silk Feather, was stuck.

82
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:17,666
-Your favorite chicken?
-Yeah.

83
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,166
-Favorite chicken.
-Great.

84
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:23,291
Well, I have recalibrated your inhibitor
and she's good to go.

85
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:26,416
So, stay away
from the electric fence, maybe?

86
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,916
Then I won't have to make any more
scary trips up here.

87
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,583
Not that I don't like coming here.

88
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:32,916
-No.
-I just...

89
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,333
Yeah, come back any time.

90
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,375
He's always in such a hurry to leave.

91
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:42,541
Well, he thought he was
here to face The Abomination.

92
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,083
What about you then, Jen?

93
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:48,166
Um, I thought you worked hard
to get out of prison

94
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,125
and you'd be really dumb to go back in.

95
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,250
Aye, true that.

96
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,125
Sorry. I thought I heard a ding.

97
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:58,041
I've already wasted half a Sunday on this
expedition, so I'm gonna get moving.

98
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:01,833
Oh, my God!

99
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:05,916
Ah! Hey! What the hell?

100
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:09,083
Wait.

101
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,541
What the hell is going on?

102
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:21,958
It's just two men working
through their resentments

103
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,583
in a safe environment, Jen.

104
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,166
Sorry. It's my fault.

105
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,875
You know what?
Apologize to my Prius Prime with money.

106
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:33,041
I will apologize to your Prius,
if that'll make you feel better.

107
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:36,166
Brother Blonsky taught me a lot
about taking responsibility for my anger.

108
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,250
Man-Bull.

109
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,958
A weird lab experiment. Don't ask.

110
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:41,083
And I am El Águila.

111
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,541
And before you make assumptions,
no, I am not a matador.

112
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,375
That'd make
the two of us fighting pretty cliché, no?

113
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,208
Working through identity issues here.

114
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:51,916
- I don't have issues.
- All right.

115
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,833
I know exactly who I am.

116
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:57,916
I am a swashbuckler.

117
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
He says that like it's an occupation.

118
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:03,750
Waving a sword around isn't a job
unless you're a matador.

119
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:09,041
You see, to Man-Bull, El Águila represents
every person who's tried to, you know,

120
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:12,583
stab him in the, you know,
for being "an affront to nature."

121
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:13,791
Of which there are many.

122
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,041
- So many.
- Yeah.

123
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,083
This is so much unnecessary backstory

124
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,500
to tell to someone
whose car you just destroyed.

125
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:22,125
I can't drive this.
How am I supposed to go home?

126
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:26,250
You know,
sometimes life presents a teacher

127
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,125
when there's a lesson to be learned.

128
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:34,416
Jen, think of this totally knackered
Prius Prime as your teacher.

129
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,875
Um, that was nothing.

130
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:37,583
You just said nothing
in response

131
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,875
-to a very straightforward question.
-Yeah.

132
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:42,500
Man-Bull? Give us a push
to the garage, would you?

133
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:45,750
Do I look like a mechanic?
My name is Man-Bull.

134
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:47,916
Not Mechanical-Bull.

135
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,250
Wow. How long have you been
waiting to say that?

136
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,083
-That felt very forced.
-You, too?

137
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:56,791
I think it's fantastic news
that the tow truck won't get here

138
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,083
until later today.

139
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,916
How is that fantastic news?

140
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,041
Well, it means that
you can spend some time here.

141
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:04,833
You know, relax.

142
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:06,583
Is there no cell reception here?

143
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:09,541
No. Okay, so, over there is the Wood Lodge

144
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:13,375
where I offer
private spiritual consultation

145
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:14,875
and life-coaching.

146
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:18,458
It's exclusive
to our Platinum Circle members.

147
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,833
-Hi, Princess. So cute.
-Uh-huh.

148
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:22,541
Uh-huh.

149
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:25,375
-You got a text.
-Did I?

150
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:26,916
-Yeah.
-Where? Very funny.

151
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,250
In our ceremonial sweat yurt,

152
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:36,708
we integrate the past
and the present into one being.

153
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,375
So, what do you say? Pick you up in 20?

154
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,750
I'm not sweating it out in a yurt today.

155
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,416
I need to get some work done.

156
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,708
So, if you could get me
a desk and some Wi-Fi.

157
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:52,333
It's a bit of a hard ask,
I'm afraid, on the Wi-Fi front.

158
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,708
We don't carry it as a policy.

159
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:57,166
You know, distractions from the outside
and all that.

160
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,375
And you have no reception
anywhere, either.

161
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,291
This isn't how I want to spend my day.

162
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:05,083
Maybe it's how you need to spend your day.

163
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,708
I'm gonna find a signal.

164
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:10,208
Clearly, you're not
in a teachable mood right now

165
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:13,500
and I do respect that. So...

166
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:19,291
I'm around if you need me.

167
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:10,333
Oh, hell, yes.

168
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:18,000
Jen! You remember El Águila and Man-Bull?

169
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,750
-Uh-huh.
-This is Porcupine. He's a porcupine.

170
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:23,416
And Saracen thinks he's a vampire.

171
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,125
Wow, this is quite a group.

172
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:28,458
- You're welcome to join.
- I'll pass.

173
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:31,666
I'm just gonna work over here
in the one square meter

174
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,833
of this property
that actually has reception.

175
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:34,916
Okay.

176
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:43,250
Last session, we really explored
Alejandro's struggles with his identity.

177
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:46,750
Just because I am Spanish
and I have a flair for the style,

178
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:49,625
people constantly assume
that I am a matador.

179
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,041
It's dehumanizing.

180
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:53,500
Spanish is a language,
not a nationality, so...

181
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,500
You've never heard of Spain?

182
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:59,166
It's not your fault,
but those attributes make me

183
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,541
see you as a matador.

184
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,625
And, well, that's triggering for me.

185
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:05,750
I did do some
light matadoring in college.

186
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,333
Oh, my God! Dude, what?

187
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:11,250
We do have to guard
against codependency here.

188
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,458
-We are not codependents.
-Interesting.

189
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:14,833
What do you think, Man-Bull?

190
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:15,916
Our relationship...

191
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,791
I'm asking Man-Bull.

192
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,250
I'd like to say something.

193
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:21,458
Great.

194
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:23,375
Saracen.

195
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,541
They have been spending
a lot of time together.

196
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:28,500
I'm feeling like maybe it's not healthy.

197
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:30,458
Mmm. Unhealthy. I called that, too.

198
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:33,041
I'm sorry. Porcupine,
you wanna share something?

199
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,625
No, thanks.

200
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:38,666
Now, remember how we talked
about vulnerability

201
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,000
and how important it is to the process?

202
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,125
Yes. Yeah.

203
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:48,541
How taking your suit off
would be a great first step?

204
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:49,791
Uh-huh. Yeah.

205
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:51,083
Yeah?

206
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,541
You wanna do that today?

207
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:57,708
I just feel safer with it on. Thank you.

208
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,791
Whoo-whee!

209
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:03,083
Sorry, I'm late.
I lost track of time in the yurt.

210
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:04,958
-No way.
-Jen.

211
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:08,125
I needed it though.
I was hurtin' for a yurtin'.

212
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:11,375
That guy is here? You probably
don't even remember who he is.

213
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:15,291
Tell me they previously on'd him.
I don't care. We're doing it again.

214
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,041
Previously on this guy!

215
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,166
If you're gonna strut around
showing off your powers,

216
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,333
you better be able to back it up.

217
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:30,333
I was visited
by a lot of feminine energy in there.

218
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,833
I think I was talking to my dead
grandmother, Rose.

219
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,166
Hard to tell when you're surfing
the yurt though. Right?

220
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:37,625
Oh, hey!

221
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,583
Jen! Jen! Jennifer!

222
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,125
Come on, I stacked those.

223
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,541
- It's cool. Let it go.
- I'm allowed to be angry!

224
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,791
-Whoa, whoa!
-This asshole and his friends

225
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,791
attacked me behind my apartment.

226
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,583
Yeah, Jennifer, darling,

227
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:56,291
I'm gonna need you
to sit in the calming chair now.

228
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:57,375
Right now.

229
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,541
The chair.

230
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,375
- You in trouble.
- Fine.

231
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:03,791
Once I'm out of there,
I'll rip this guy to shreds.

232
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:07,125
Hold on. That is not how we work through
our issues around here.

233
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,291
-Well, she's welcome to the circle.
-Okay.

234
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,333
-But she has to get her own chair.
-Okay.

235
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:15,541
I'd love to work through
our issues if you'll let me.

236
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:22,000
So, I realized real strength comes from
looking in the mirror and saying,

237
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:25,458
"Hey, man, I'm gonna work on me."

238
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:29,500
I didn't need a magic crowbar
to give me a false sense of power.

239
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:32,041
All it did was make me
and my boys act like idiots.

240
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:35,541
Rolling up on you like we were
some supervillains or something.

241
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:39,500
You attacked a woman four to one.
You absolutely were supervillains.

242
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:44,000
I hear you, Jen, and I take
radical accountability for my actions.

243
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:46,250
And I'm very sorry.

244
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,958
Oh, my God.

245
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,958
Seems like a breakthrough.
He's so sorry.

246
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:51,416
- Sarcasm.
- Wow.

247
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,541
Hennifer clearly has some stuff going on,

248
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:57,375
and she'd rather sit here,
getting her kicks,

249
00:17:57,458 --> 00:18:00,041
listening to us, than working on herself.

250
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:03,250
I'm not getting my kicks. And I'm fine.

251
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,416
What?

252
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,500
You're not fine.

253
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:08,041
Flying into a rage.
Throwing people across the room.

254
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,875
-Into perfectly stacked chairs.
-Mmm-hmm.

255
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,333
Everyone else has shared.

256
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:16,166
So is there anything
you wanna get off your chest?

257
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,208
- No.
- Look at you.

258
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:21,500
You are glued to that thing.

259
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,583
I met a guy, Josh, at a wedding.

260
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:36,250
We went on a few dates.
I thought it was going great.

261
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,083
Then, I haven't heard from him.

262
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,416
Now I can't stop thinking about it. Okay?

263
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,916
-When was the last time you talked to him?
-Uh,

264
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,125
three nights ago when we...

265
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,458
Made love?

266
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:47,625
First off, ew.

267
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:50,083
No, when we'd slept together
for the first time.

268
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:52,791
-Another direct hit.
-Okay, are you two married?

269
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,541
-Come on.
-Codependency.

270
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:58,083
Yeah, actually, could you
switch seats with someone?

271
00:18:58,166 --> 00:18:59,166
Anyone?

272
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,208
-It's feeling just a little unhealthy.
-Mmm-hmm.

273
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:04,791
Thank you.

274
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,166
So how many dates?

275
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,416
- Three.
- What was the last thing you texted him?

276
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,791
Um...

277
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,375
"That was fun. I can't stop smiling."

278
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:16,833
-Oh, God.
-Yikes.

279
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:18,708
- What?
- "I can't stop smiling"?

280
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,708
It is thirsty and a cliché.

281
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,333
You're thirsty and a cliché.

282
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:24,333
No, she did not just call me...

283
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:27,458
Bottom line. You said game on
and he didn't respond.

284
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:32,458
-That's not the last thing I texted him.
-I'm sorry, what?

285
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:36,000
Just now 'cause I was so worried
I hadn't heard from him in so long.

286
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:39,541
-He could be in a ditch somewhere.
-What did you do?

287
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:44,083
"Hey, getting a little worried.
Just wanna know you're okay."

288
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,291
Blushing smile emoji.

289
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,000
Why would you do that?

290
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,000
I don't know! I was freaking out, okay?

291
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:53,166
It's a real bad look.

292
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,833
I know it's a bad look, Man-Bull.

293
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:57,625
You don't have to point out my mistakes.
My mom does that.

294
00:19:57,708 --> 00:20:02,375
We have to consider the very real
possibility that you were ghosted.

295
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,125
-Or he wanted your blood.
-No, not that.

296
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,083
Don't talk about blood.
We're not your dad.

297
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,291
Don't talk about my dad.

298
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:08,708
<i>Hermanos,</i> please.

299
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,291
Jen, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to talk so...

300
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:16,416
No.

301
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:22,500
I met him when I was Jen,
and he liked Jen.

302
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:25,291
He specifically didn't ask about She-Hulk.

303
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:34,041
You know in high-school that friend
you have that's like, cooler than you are?

304
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:38,708
Like, more attractive and athletic.
They get all the attention from everyone.

305
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:42,875
Hello.

306
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:49,500
Like, you think life would be
so much easier if I were that person,

307
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:55,541
and I can turn into that person
anytime I want to.

308
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:58,333
And everyone pays attention when I'm this.

309
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:03,708
Like, my colleagues, my boss, guys.

310
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:09,958
But it feels like cheating

311
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:14,875
because would they like me
if I didn't have all of this?

312
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:19,666
Like, if I was just Jen,
would the same guys who like She-Hulk

313
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:24,541
stick around for Jen?
Because some of them don't.

314
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:30,083
And that sucks for Jen
because Jen is great,

315
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:33,166
and no one cares when they're She-Hulk.

316
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:37,125
So, like, I meet this guy
who actually likes Jen,

317
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:40,166
and that just felt good
to know that, you know?

318
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:44,333
And then, he ghosts me and it sucks.

319
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,291
Screw this guy! Where does he live?

320
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:53,291
Let's kill him. He's gotta die.

321
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:54,416
Big men, please.

322
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,583
No. Man-Bull's correct.

323
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:59,000
Josh has made
an enemy of this entire group.

324
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:01,333
Tonight, we ride!

325
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:02,625
That's awesome!

326
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:06,833
Alejandro, you've been warned about using
bio-electricity in group before.

327
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:07,958
Sorry.

328
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:10,458
Let's find this Josh guy
and suck out all his blood.

329
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:11,583
Yes!

330
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:15,291
No, wait, guys! Wait! Jen is hurting,

331
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,583
and all we can offer her is violence?

332
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:24,833
Does anyone think
they could speak to Jen's pain

333
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:27,916
with the tools
that we've learned in the group?

334
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:32,875
Well, for one thing, I'd say
you can't control what others do.

335
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:36,416
It hurts when someone rejects us

336
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:40,916
because it reminds us
of the times we reject ourselves.

337
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:43,375
Maybe this Josh thing hurts so much

338
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:46,291
'cause you haven't been spending
enough time with Jen.

339
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:51,500
And that's a shame
because I bet Jen is pretty damn great...

340
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:53,083
-Yeah.
-...and tasty.

341
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:54,208
Went off the rails.

342
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:55,958
-Somebody bail me out.
-Maybe...

343
00:22:56,041 --> 00:23:00,041
just maybe this Josh isn't the only guy
who likes Jen Walters.

344
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:02,833
Maybe, there's a group of guys
right here

345
00:23:02,916 --> 00:23:05,708
who would love to spend time
with Jen right now.

346
00:23:06,416 --> 00:23:07,458
Okay, Jen.

347
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:12,541
Do you believe that this group
genuinely values the whole of you?

348
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:19,708
-I do.
-And there it is.

349
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:25,583
So maybe, you can stop using She-Hulk
as a protective shield

350
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:28,083
and trust us with Jen.

351
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:45,166
Yeah!

352
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:47,958
Great job.

353
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:50,750
I gotta say that felt really good.

354
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:52,125
Well...

355
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:54,041
Felt really good, Porcupine.

356
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:09,375
Oh, my God!

357
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:12,166
- It smells like a fart.
- Yeah.

358
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,375
- Feels really good.
- Oh, man.

359
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:16,791
How many hours a day
do you wear that mask, Papa?

360
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:18,791
-Why? Am I ashy?
-No, no, no.

361
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:24,583
Could you just leave the suit on
until we can get it dry cleaned?

362
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:25,708
Okay.

363
00:24:25,791 --> 00:24:29,875
You know, Jen.
If Josh isn't spending time on Jen,

364
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:32,583
then Jen doesn't need
to be spending time on Josh.

365
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:35,083
Delete Josh's number
is what he's saying.

366
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:36,416
Oh.

367
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:38,875
-Delete it.
-Delete it.

368
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:40,833
-Delete it.
-Come on.

369
00:24:40,916 --> 00:24:42,583
Delete it.

370
00:24:42,666 --> 00:24:43,875
Really?

371
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:46,666
Delete it.
Delete it. Delete it.

372
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:50,458
Delete it. Delete it. Delete it.
Delete it. Delete it.

373
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:55,166
Okay. How do you feel? So much growth.

374
00:24:56,708 --> 00:24:59,708
I can't believe I'm gonna say this,

375
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:01,250
but I'm hurtin' for a yurtin'.

376
00:25:26,166 --> 00:25:29,166
Jen! I knew it. I told you!

377
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,333
I told you!

378
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,000
Have to say it's not so.

379
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:39,250
Guys, I will never forget
any of you, honestly.

380
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:41,583
Well, we made this for you.

381
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:46,833
Aw. "Bye, Jen. We love Jen and She-Hulk."

382
00:25:46,916 --> 00:25:48,166
-We do.
-"The gang."

383
00:25:48,416 --> 00:25:51,458
-That's nice.
-Says "gang" but it's not a literal gang.

384
00:25:51,541 --> 00:25:53,958
Just make sure you make
that clear to the parole board.

385
00:25:54,041 --> 00:25:55,583
Yeah, I will. Yeah.

386
00:25:56,583 --> 00:25:57,625
-Okay.
-Bye.

387
00:25:57,708 --> 00:25:59,125
- You got this.
- Take it easy.

388
00:25:59,208 --> 00:26:01,625
-Sorry about the car again.
-That's okay.

389
00:26:01,916 --> 00:26:04,375
-You stay out of trouble.
-Yeah. You, too, darlin'.

390
00:26:04,458 --> 00:26:05,666
And Jen,

391
00:26:06,791 --> 00:26:10,625
next time you think of Josh,
remember everyone we meet,

392
00:26:10,708 --> 00:26:15,041
no matter how much they hurt you,
is a lesson learned.

393
00:26:17,291 --> 00:26:20,416
Yeah. Despite those platitudes,
I am happy that I stuck around.

394
00:26:20,541 --> 00:26:21,916
Feel free to come again.

395
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,583
Ooh, not till you get Wi-Fi.

396
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,000
-Okay.
-Come on.
