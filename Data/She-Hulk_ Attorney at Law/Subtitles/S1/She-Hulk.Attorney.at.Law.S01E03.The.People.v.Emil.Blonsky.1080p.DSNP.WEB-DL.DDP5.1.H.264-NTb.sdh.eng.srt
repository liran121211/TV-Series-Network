you assign me...

Also known as Abomination.

17
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,875
Do you wanna explain to me why 
you failed to mention

18
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:47,625
that you not only escaped from prison,
but you were also recorded doing so?

19
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:50,708
You said to my face that you never
turn into the Abomination anymore.

20
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:53,458
No, I said I choose not to.

21
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:56,875
You know, these were extenuating 
circumstances.

22
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:59,625
You understand that this constitutes 
another crime

23
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:01,666
and totally destroys your chances 
at parole?

24
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:03,583

25
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:08,083
Nah, ‘cos I was forced to leave 
my cell,

00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:11,708
but I returned of my own free will.

Who forced you to escape this insanely 
high-security prison undetected?

28
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:21,375
A Sorcerer Supreme of the Mystic Arts,
and his name is...

29
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:24,041
Wong. Just Wong.

30
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:26,625
And his Internet presence is a little chaotic.

31
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:29,916
He's either a sorcerer who lives in New York,

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,083
or a librarian who lives in Nepal.

33
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:33,500
Can you get to him?

34
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,875
<i>Yes, Jen. It's me.
Of course I can get to him.</i>

35
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:38,750
I sent a thirst trap. It was a picture
of me with a bunch of books.

36
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,708
Yeah, well, let's just hope he 
calls back.

37
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:42,250
If Blonsky's telling the truth,

38
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:46,333
this guy busted him out of his prison cell
and probably ruined my entire case.

39
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:50,375
I know you can't wait to see Wong.
I get it.

you don't think

Everything Mr. Blonsky told you
is factual.

120

I extracted him from the prison
against his own wishes,

121
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,083
because I required a worthy opponent

122
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:50,583
as part of my training to become 
Sorcerer Supreme.

123
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:54,458
And as Sorcerer Supreme, I insist that
he not be punished for my actions.

124

Again, I am not the one who will be 
punishing him.

after seeing this video.

Not again.

128
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,291
That is not what I was thinking.
That is highly unethical.

129
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,708
Yeah, it's also very messy, believe me.

130
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:13,166
Okay.
We'll send him to the Mirror Dimension.

131

Don't know what that is, but no.

you tell me higher or lower, okay?

139
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:44,125
Considering that you bought her 
a mid-sized sedan, how about $50,000?

140
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:46,750
100?

We are here today to determine
whether Emil Blonsky is

185
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:29,541
suitable for return to society after 
having served his minimum sentence.

186
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:32,458
In light of recent evidence of 
a prison escape,

187
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:35,458
I think we all know how this is gonna go.
So, let's keep this brief.

188
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:39,875
As Mr. Blonsky's counsel, I would love to
address the alleged prison escape.

189
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,416
We do have a witness

190
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,041
who is able to clear Mr. Blonsky
of any wrongdoing on his part.

191
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,666
Then we'll start with that then.

192
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:51,958
Well, yes, the witness is prepared
to give a statement

193
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:54,458

00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:04,708
Now hold on. Mr. Blonsky, do you feel 
you have been rehabilitated?

197
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,125
Uh...

198
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:14,375
Let's start by saying that I feel great remorse,

199
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:17,875
great shame to those that I've harmed.

200
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:21,958
So, to answer your question, 
yes, I feel I have been rehabilitated.

201
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:28,166
I've spent every day of my incarceration
focused solely on redemption.

202
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,166
I have changed.

203
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:34,125

Et cetera.

206
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:42,208
What Mr. Blonsky is trying to say is that 
the man you see before you

207
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,958
is not the same Emil Blonsky as before.

208
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:48,166
All he wants now is to be 
a contributing member of society.

209
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,166
If released, would you have a place to live?

210
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,375
Yeah. You can rely on that.

211
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:58,958
Mr. Blonsky does own a plot of land
on which he plans to work and reside.

212
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,083
He's going into farming?

213
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:05,791
No. Actually, he plans to open
a meditation retreat on the property.

214
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:08,291
So, just very... Well, you know...

215
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:13,000
And how does Mr. Blonsky intend 
to fund this endeavor?

216
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,500
Mr. Blonsky is currently

217
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,250
in a long-term committed relationship
with several pen pals.

218
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:23,708
All of whom have pledged
to financially support him.

Blonsky started the prison's literacy program.

227

He's helped countless prisoners 
learn how to read.

228

for Emil Blonsky leaving prison.

335
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:59,041

336
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:01,208

337
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,208
Yeah. You realize that

338
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:08,083

a prisoner escape, which is a crime.

339
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:09,208

341
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,958
How do you plan to take Blonsky down
when he rampages again?

342
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:31,750
What about claims that you're 
one of Blonsky's rumored soulmates?

343
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,000
Is there any truth to the rumors

344

undoubtedly hoping to avoid the protesters

346

that are gathered just outside the gates here.

347
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:46,500
And then I get to my car,
and some protester has written on it,

348
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,416
"Monster defending a monster."

349
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,708

one little interview.

You are a story now.

Okay, yeah. No. I don't want this.

356
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,541
Oh, my God. You're pregnant
with the Abomination's baby,

357
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,208
and you're flaunting a baby-bump.

358
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:16,875

Yeah.

Yeah. No, you're gonna need that.
Connecting the A and B story. Nice.

361
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,541
How did you two work with him 
for so long?

362
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:29,583
Oh, I killed him in my head several times,
in many different ways.

363
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:32,041
And yet he was convinced that 
she had a crush on him.

364
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:35,333
The man is almost terminally deluded.
I'd call him gross.

365
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:37,083
JENNIFER: Yeah. Just gross.

366
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:39,458
Hey, would you be willing to say 
that under oath?

367
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:42,541
I swear the testimony I'm about 
to give today

368
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:45,041
is the truth, the whole truth and 
nothing but the truth.

369
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:49,291
Hey, P-Dog, how is Jen our best option?
I gave you a whole list of my boys.

370
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:52,208
Jen is gonna help us clinch this.
Trust me.

371
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:56,416
Ms. Walters, how would you describe
your relationship to Mr. Bukowski?

372
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,541
We worked together for several years
at the DA's office.

373
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,375
Would you say that 
you know Mr. Bukowski fairly well?

374
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:05,916
Definitely. We worked regularly
on cases together,

375
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,916
so I've spent a lot of time with 
Mr. Bukowski.

376
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:13,916
Did he ever share his personal life
with you? Specifically, his dating life.

377
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,916
Yes, he would, prolifically and unprompted.

378
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,208
You wanted to know.

379
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:23,708
How would you characterize Mr. Bukowski
in relation to his romantic life?

380
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:28,791
Self-absorbed, chauvinistic, conceited.

381
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:33,583
He once described himself as a 
New York 10 and an LA 11.

382
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,041
(LAUGHS)

383
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,208
He nicknamed his office the Dennisphere...

384
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:40,166
Objection. Relevance.

385
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:44,666
Mr. Bukowski, need I remind you that
you're not representing yourself here?

386
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:46,750
And this is your witness.

387
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:50,375
But I agree. Mr. Pugliese, get 
to your point.

388
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,958
It's been stated many times in 
this courtroom

389
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:55,041
that a man of reasonable intelligence

390
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:58,291
would never think that he was dating 
the real Megan Thee Stallion.

391
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:03,250
In your opinion, Ms. Walters, do you think
that Dennis Bukowski would believe

392
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:07,125
that he could actually pull
Megan Thee Stallion?

393
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:12,333
Yes. Dennis Bukowski is an almost 
pathologically entitled man.

394
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:15,708
He would absolutely believe that he's 
dating the real Megan Thee Stallion

395
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:17,875
because he is truly that delusional.

396
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:20,208
No further questions, Your Honor.

397
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:32,166
In the case of <i>Bukowski v. Runa,</i>
I award full damages to Dennis Bukowski

398
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:36,041
in the amount of $175,000.

399
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:37,250
In addition,

400
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:43,541
we also sentence the defendant 
to 60 days for impersonating a judge.

401
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:45,291
No, no, no, no, no, no.

402
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:47,791
That's right.
There's only one Megan Thee Stallion.

404

the real Megan Thee Stallion?

406

Should I go back?

407
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,625
No. No. Please, don't do that.
Thanks for that testimony in there, Jen.

get a slap on the wrist.

410

I wish there was a way we could 
remove her powers

411
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,041
and make sure she doesn't victimize 
anyone else.

give me an idea?
