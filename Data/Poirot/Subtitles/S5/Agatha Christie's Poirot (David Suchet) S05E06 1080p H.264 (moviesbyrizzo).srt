1
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:25,874
- Can't you understand?

2
00:01:26,167 --> 00:01:29,666
It's our future and Belgium's
future that I'm thinking of.

3
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:33,041
The Catholic Church has narrowed
your mind, Marianne,

4
00:01:33,334 --> 00:01:35,041
just as it has my mother's.

5
00:01:35,334 --> 00:01:38,374
- But don't you see, Paul?

6
00:01:38,667 --> 00:01:43,499
You keep asking me to choose
between you and my faith.

7
00:01:43,792 --> 00:01:46,916
- I can't believe what
you're saying, Marianne.

8
00:01:47,209 --> 00:01:50,374
You mean fresh ideas
have no place in your mind?

9
00:01:50,667 --> 00:01:52,916
My God,
we're into a new century,

10
00:01:53,209 --> 00:01:56,708
but you are stuck in the last,
just like your damned clergy.

11
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,333
- Attacking the church
won't help Belgium, Paul.

12
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:01,041
It'll turn
the people against you.

13
00:02:01,334 --> 00:02:02,624
- I don't attack it!

14
00:02:02,917 --> 00:02:04,749
I want it to open its eyes.

15
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:07,291
And as my wife, the wife
of a government minister,

16
00:02:07,584 --> 00:02:09,083
you should support me in that.

17
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:12,083
- I married you for love, Paul,

18
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:14,624
not to advance
your political career.

19
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:17,999
- Marianne, come back here!

20
00:02:18,292 --> 00:02:19,874
Marianne!

21
00:03:03,042 --> 00:03:04,333
- Well, Poirot, how does it feel

22
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:06,666
being back in Brussels
again after so many years?

23
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,041
- In the eye of my mind,
Chief Inspector,

24
00:03:08,334 --> 00:03:11,333
I have never left.

25
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,791
- Place is bound
to have changed, though.

26
00:03:14,084 --> 00:03:15,374
- Naturellement.

27
00:03:15,667 --> 00:03:17,208
But we are not here
for the memory lane of Poirot,

28
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,291
mon ami, non?

29
00:03:18,542 --> 00:03:20,124
We come for the paying
of the tributes

30
00:03:20,417 --> 00:03:22,374
to your good self.

31
00:03:23,792 --> 00:03:25,416
To be made
a Compagnon de la Branche d'Or,

32
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:28,166
it is the highest honor
my country can bestow.

33
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:29,999
- Very kind of Belgium, yes.

34
00:03:30,292 --> 00:03:32,041
But all I've done
over the years is my job.

35
00:03:32,334 --> 00:03:34,416
- Not at all, Chief Inspector.

36
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:37,416
Time and again, ever since
the Abercrombie forgery case,

37
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:38,874
you have helped
the Belgian police.

38
00:03:39,167 --> 00:03:41,249
And my country, it is grateful.

39
00:03:41,542 --> 00:03:43,166
- Pity Emily couldn't come.

40
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:45,041
Still, I think she was right.

41
00:03:45,334 --> 00:03:47,458
Brussels is a far cry
from Isleworth.

42
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,708
- Her loss is my gain.

43
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,124
It is an honor to deputize
for Madame Japp.

44
00:03:55,542 --> 00:03:57,083
- Poirot.

45
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:58,999
- Chantalier.

46
00:04:03,334 --> 00:04:04,333
- Ah.

47
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:08,333
Mon dieu, 20 years,
and you look the same.

48
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:09,749
Is this fair, mon ami, eh?

49
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:11,374
- Oh.
- Oh, pardon.

50
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:13,999
You know the
Chief Inspector Japp, of course.

51
00:04:14,292 --> 00:04:15,291
- We work together often.

52
00:04:15,584 --> 00:04:17,124
- Congratulations
on your new appointment, sir,

53
00:04:17,417 --> 00:04:19,249
Commissaire de Police.

54
00:04:19,542 --> 00:04:22,249
However did you manage, sir,
when he went off to England?

55
00:04:22,542 --> 00:04:25,374
- He wasn't always so clever,
Chief Inspector.

56
00:04:26,584 --> 00:04:28,249
You remember Paul Deroulard?

57
00:04:31,042 --> 00:04:33,666
- I remember
that it was not I

58
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,791
who made the mistakes
in that case.

59
00:04:36,084 --> 00:04:37,666
It was everyone else.

60
00:04:38,709 --> 00:04:41,458
- The old modesty lives on.

61
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,666
Paul Deroulard died
of natural causes, Hercule.

62
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:47,291
The verdict of the court
is there for all time.

63
00:04:47,584 --> 00:04:48,874
Mm-hmm.

64
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,208
- And it is wrong.

65
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:59,291
- Tell you what.
I'm a disinterested party.

66
00:04:59,584 --> 00:05:01,999
Let me be the judge of this.

67
00:05:07,209 --> 00:05:10,749
- It was just before the war,
Chief Inspector.

68
00:05:11,042 --> 00:05:12,541
His death was reported
to the police in the--

69
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:14,374
- Ah.

70
00:05:14,667 --> 00:05:16,583
That was the first mistake.

71
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:18,666
The Deroulard case
began two years earlier,

72
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:21,749
when his wife Marianne fell
down the stairs to her death.

73
00:05:23,292 --> 00:05:25,666
- An accident, Poirot.

74
00:05:27,417 --> 00:05:29,458
- The Belgian philosopher
himself Georges Tabineau

75
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,791
once said to me--
he said, "Poirot,

76
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:38,708
there is no such thing
as an accident."

77
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,958
However, we shall let that pass.

78
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,374
On the night of his death,

79
00:05:43,667 --> 00:05:46,791
Paul Deroulard
was entertaining some friends.

80
00:05:47,084 --> 00:05:50,041
Seated around the table were
Virginie Mesnard.

81
00:05:50,334 --> 00:05:52,666
next to her, the distinguished
friend of Paul,

82
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:56,541
le Comte du St. Alard.

83
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:57,833
At the head of the table,

84
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:01,749
the mother to Paul,
Madame Deroulard,

85
00:06:02,042 --> 00:06:04,708
and at her side,
her confidant and advisor,

86
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,666
an old family friend,
Gaston Beaujeu.

87
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:10,999
- It's a lovely wine.
- Good.

88
00:06:11,292 --> 00:06:13,249
- Virginie was
cousin to Marianne,

89
00:06:13,542 --> 00:06:14,874
the dead wife of Paul.

90
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:18,333
- That new language law, Paul,
what exactly does it say?

91
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,333
- From now on,
all commands in the army

92
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:23,291
must be given in Flemish
as well as French.

93
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:26,083
- All I pray is that you
and your friends in government

94
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:30,166
have no plans for the mass
to be said in Flemish, Paul.

95
00:06:32,834 --> 00:06:34,416
- Now I see it.

96
00:06:36,542 --> 00:06:39,499
This law is just
the tip of the iceberg.

97
00:06:44,542 --> 00:06:46,499
Your late wife
always said that one day

98
00:06:46,792 --> 00:06:48,374
you'd get your claws
into the church.

99
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:49,791
- Absurd.

100
00:06:50,084 --> 00:06:52,874
Now, sit down, St. Alard, before
you make a fool of yourself.

101
00:06:53,167 --> 00:06:55,999
- The press knows you're against
the Catholic Church, Paul.

102
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:02,791
- For your own sake,
I forbid you to say any more.

103
00:07:03,084 --> 00:07:04,583
- And given half the chance,

104
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:07,833
you'd appease
the Kaiser as well.

105
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,708
Then I suppose
we'd all be speaking German.

106
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,541
- Another chocolate,
Monsieur Beaujeu?

107
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:29,416
- After dinner,
it was left to Gaston Beaujeu,

108
00:07:29,709 --> 00:07:32,124
in his customary role
as mediator,

109
00:07:32,417 --> 00:07:34,624
to soothe the troubled waters.

110
00:07:34,917 --> 00:07:36,833
- Thank you.

111
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,708
You and St. Alard
have been friends too long

112
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,041
to fall out over politics.

113
00:07:42,334 --> 00:07:43,458
- He lives in the past.

114
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,583
A divided Belgium, Gaston,

115
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,541
Flemings to the North,
Walloons to the south,

116
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:51,499
that's our history,
not our future.

117
00:07:51,792 --> 00:07:54,124
- But if Germany attacks,

118
00:07:54,417 --> 00:07:55,916
where will he stand then?

119
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,541
- In the front line, my friend,
have no fear.

120
00:07:58,834 --> 00:08:01,541
He would
take them on single-handed.

121
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,624
- At around midnight,
the guests departed.

122
00:08:05,917 --> 00:08:09,083
Madame retired
to her nightly devotions,

123
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:12,916
and the Deroulard household
slept.

124
00:08:15,292 --> 00:08:19,416
All except Paul,
a slave to insomnia,

125
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:23,124
who returned to his study
in order to work.

126
00:08:41,834 --> 00:08:45,166
Paul had a reputation for
his austerity and discipline.

127
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:47,499
He did, however, have two vices:

128
00:08:47,792 --> 00:08:50,666
the pursuit of his career

129
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,124
and chocolates.

130
00:09:36,084 --> 00:09:38,291
- My duties
as a junior police officer

131
00:09:38,584 --> 00:09:41,958
involved my regular attendance
at the court of the coroner.

132
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,249
The death of Paul Deroulard
was treated

133
00:09:45,542 --> 00:09:48,124
by all those concerned
as a matter of routine.

134
00:09:48,417 --> 00:09:49,583
- Indeed not, Your Honor.

135
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:51,124
Paul Deroulard...

136
00:09:51,417 --> 00:09:52,916
- Those giving evidence
saw no reason

137
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:55,124
to question the death of Paul,

138
00:09:55,417 --> 00:09:57,708
and at first, neither did I.

139
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,291
- Being the victim
of foul play...

140
00:10:00,584 --> 00:10:02,791
- The principal witness
in the case was my superior,

141
00:10:03,084 --> 00:10:04,541
Superintendent Boucher.

142
00:10:04,834 --> 00:10:07,124
- Foul play
might have been the case?

143
00:10:07,417 --> 00:10:09,124
- Nothing whatsoever, monsieur.

144
00:10:09,417 --> 00:10:11,833
We searched the house
and found nothing untoward.

145
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,624
- You may step down.

146
00:10:18,292 --> 00:10:21,666
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am more than satisfied

147
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:25,833
that Paul Deroulard's death,
though a tragedy, of course,

148
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,166
was due to heart failure,

149
00:10:28,459 --> 00:10:30,708
And I give
my verdict accordingly.

150
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,708
- That can't be right!

151
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:37,083
- You have further evidence,
Mademoiselle Mesnard?

152
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,499
- I tell you,
he can’t just have died.

153
00:10:39,792 --> 00:10:41,916
Well, why do you
take everyone at their word?

154
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:43,708
- I would advise you,
mademoiselle,

155
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,124
to guard your remarks
when addressing me.

156
00:10:47,417 --> 00:10:48,249
- Forgive her, monsieur,

157
00:10:48,542 --> 00:10:50,666
but she is much affected
by the death.

158
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,124
We will look after her.

159
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,541
- My colleague Chantalier and I

160
00:10:56,834 --> 00:11:00,291
felt that the case was
being dismissed too readily.

161
00:11:00,584 --> 00:11:02,541
And although
we were only there as observers,

162
00:11:02,834 --> 00:11:04,291
we decided it was our duty

163
00:11:04,584 --> 00:11:07,166
to raise the matter
with Superintendent Boucher.

164
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:08,916
Superintendent Boucher,

165
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:11,249
one moment, if you please.

166
00:11:11,542 --> 00:11:13,499
Chantalier and myself,
we would be very happy

167
00:11:13,792 --> 00:11:15,958
to investigate further
the Deroulard case.

168
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:19,249
- What for, may I ask?

169
00:11:19,542 --> 00:11:22,833
- Oh, the outburst
of the young lady in court.

170
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,833
Can--can we ignore that?

171
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:26,958
And also, the victim,
he was a government minister.

172
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,124
- That is precisely why you will
put it out of your mind, Poirot.

173
00:11:30,417 --> 00:11:31,208
- Superintendent--

174
00:11:31,459 --> 00:11:34,374
- The case is closed, gentlemen.

175
00:11:45,209 --> 00:11:48,166
- But it was
an invitation most unexpected

176
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:51,708
which ensured
that the case was not closed.

177
00:11:54,834 --> 00:11:56,708
- Ah, Hercule.

178
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,083
- Henri, bonjour, ça va?

179
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,374
- Mm-hmm.

180
00:11:59,667 --> 00:12:02,208
Why have you
kept it a secret from me?

181
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,458
- What are you talking about,
Henri?

182
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,749
- The young lady
I spoke to you about,

183
00:12:06,042 --> 00:12:06,833
she's at table five.

184
00:12:07,084 --> 00:12:09,083
- Ah.

185
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:10,624
Merci.

186
00:12:10,917 --> 00:12:13,166
- She asked for you specially.

187
00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:14,416
- By name?

188
00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:16,041
- By mustache.

189
00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:26,999
- Hercule Poirot?

190
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,916
- At your service, mademoiselle.

191
00:12:29,209 --> 00:12:30,416
- Virginie Mesnard.

192
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:32,958
- Mademoiselle Mesnard.

193
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,916
- Would you take a seat, please?

194
00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:36,708
- Merci.

195
00:12:46,459 --> 00:12:47,458
I was in court, mademoiselle,

196
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,916
when you expressed
a certain doubt

197
00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:50,999
concerning the death
of Monsieur Paul Deroulard.

198
00:12:51,292 --> 00:12:53,333
- How can he have died
of heart failure?

199
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,958
He was such a robust man.

200
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,333
- And that is all upon which
you base your doubt,

201
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,708
his apparent good health?

202
00:13:02,834 --> 00:13:05,583
- And some feminine instinct,
monsieur.

203
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:09,416
You believe in such a thing?

204
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:13,041
- Perhaps.

205
00:13:17,542 --> 00:13:19,041
Why is it that you come to me?

206
00:13:19,334 --> 00:13:21,666
- A friend of mine is
a secretary at the local paper,

207
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:23,708
and the editor
mentions your name often.

208
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,041
"A spark in the otherwise dull
embers of the police force,"

209
00:13:27,334 --> 00:13:28,666
he says.

210
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:30,999
- Ah.

211
00:13:32,584 --> 00:13:33,999
He is a man of perception.

212
00:13:41,084 --> 00:13:43,333
Will you help me, monsieur?

213
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,291
- Et bien, mademoiselle,
I have been told

214
00:13:46,584 --> 00:13:48,249
that the case, it is closed.

215
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,291
But I am due some leave,

216
00:13:57,584 --> 00:13:59,374
which I shall take.

217
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:06,458
- A difficult smile to resist,
eh, Hercule?

218
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,874
- Yes, indeed.

219
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,749
Oh, if you think
that the young lady

220
00:14:13,042 --> 00:14:15,708
and not the case attracted me,
you do me a wrong, Claude.

221
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,833
- Yet you still
wear the trinket she gave you.

222
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,458
- What, this?

223
00:14:25,292 --> 00:14:26,624
Bien sûr.

224
00:14:28,084 --> 00:14:29,083
If you think that Poirot

225
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,124
could not see beyond
that smile most bewitching

226
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:32,874
and that her charm
was such that--

227
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:37,499
- Toujours la femme,
Chief Inspector.

228
00:14:37,792 --> 00:14:40,499
You have a phrase in English
which means the same?

229
00:14:40,792 --> 00:14:43,333
- Well, nothing as crisp
as yours, sir.

230
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,083
We just tend to say
something like,

231
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:46,166
"Mark my words,

232
00:14:46,417 --> 00:14:48,458
there'll be a woman
at the bottom of it somewhere."

233
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:53,374
- Hercule,
it's the Comte du St. Alard.

234
00:14:54,792 --> 00:14:57,583
- Ah, Monsieur le Comte,
bonsoir.

235
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,374
Will you join us?

236
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,583
- Have you come to interfere
in yet more business

237
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,666
that doesn't concern you,

238
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:07,791
to ruin a few more reputations?

239
00:15:10,584 --> 00:15:12,333
- As mayor of this city,
St. Alard,

240
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:15,166
your reputation
has never been better.

241
00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:17,833
- No thanks
to this meddling upstart,

242
00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:28,124
I swore to myself, Poirot,

243
00:15:28,417 --> 00:15:30,874
the next time I saw you,

244
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:33,083
no matter when it was,
the very next time, I would--

245
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,458
- Monsieur le Comte.

246
00:15:43,584 --> 00:15:44,958
- If that's
the Belgian aristocracy,

247
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,583
it's about time
you had a revolution.

248
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:50,083
- He was not entirely
unprovoked, Chief Inspector.

249
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,208
- I was there, Poirot.
You didn't do anything.

250
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,958
- But you were not there
all those years ago, mon ami,

251
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,166
when I gave him cause
to resent me.

252
00:16:09,917 --> 00:16:12,166
- This, um,
Compagnon de la Branche d'Or

253
00:16:12,459 --> 00:16:13,458
they're awarding me, Poirot...

254
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,541
- Ouiais?

255
00:16:14,834 --> 00:16:16,333
- I mean, what exactly
is a Branche d'Or?

256
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:19,208
- It is a golden branch
of an olive tree, mon ami.

257
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,958
In Greek mythology,
he who carried it

258
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,291
became invincible.

259
00:16:22,584 --> 00:16:25,833
Very useful in our line of work,
n'est-ce pas, Chief Inspector?

260
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:28,458
- Do we know
who's presenting it yet?

261
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,458
- By tradition, it must be
a fellow compagnon.

262
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,374
But who it will be
is yet undecided.

263
00:16:33,667 --> 00:16:34,999
- My wife wanted royalty,
of course,

264
00:16:35,292 --> 00:16:36,541
but I'm not fussy.

265
00:16:36,834 --> 00:16:38,458
- Ah!

266
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,791
The Deroulard house.

267
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,541
It has changed very little.

268
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,291
The refusal
of Superintendent Boucher

269
00:16:50,584 --> 00:16:54,249
to further investigate the death
had angered me.

270
00:16:54,542 --> 00:16:56,166
So it was
that in the company of Virginie,

271
00:16:56,459 --> 00:16:58,916
I began my own inquiries.

272
00:16:59,209 --> 00:17:00,416
On arriving
at the Deroulard house,

273
00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:03,874
I met for the first time
Madame Deroulard.

274
00:17:04,167 --> 00:17:06,458
- You must introduce
the young man, Virginie.

275
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,958
She doesn't bring home
many friends, Monsieur...

276
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,499
- Hercule Poirot, madame.

277
00:17:10,792 --> 00:17:12,333
I am a policeman.

278
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:14,208
- I've seen too much
of the police lately,

279
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,458
Monsieur Poirot.

280
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,458
- And all have believed
that your son,

281
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,541
he died of heart failure,
madame?

282
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:24,916
- I see the work of your hand
in this, Virginie.

283
00:17:27,417 --> 00:17:29,083
- Forgive me, madame,
but for Paul's sake,

284
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,874
I couldn't live with my doubts.

285
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:34,416
- Perhaps I might be able
to put her mind at rest, madame,

286
00:17:34,709 --> 00:17:35,958
when perhaps
I have seen the study

287
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,499
and spoken with your servants?

288
00:17:49,417 --> 00:17:52,166
Who is this lady,
the wife of Monsieur Deroulard?

289
00:17:52,459 --> 00:17:55,041
- Yes.
Marianne, my cousin.

290
00:17:55,334 --> 00:17:57,791
She died two years ago,

291
00:17:58,084 --> 00:18:00,874
an accident here in the house.

292
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:02,749
Paul never really got over it.

293
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:06,583
- So he kept her in the desk?

294
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,666
Out of sight, out of mind,
perhaps?

295
00:18:09,959 --> 00:18:13,249
- Paul and his mother
had a permanent tussle.

296
00:18:13,542 --> 00:18:15,374
I never really quite understood.

297
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:17,916
Paul would hide
the photograph in the drawer.

298
00:18:18,209 --> 00:18:19,708
His mother
would bring it out again.

299
00:18:22,542 --> 00:18:24,083
Oh, Monsieur Beaujeu,

300
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:27,208
I'd like you to meet
Hercule Poirot.

301
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,833
Gaston is our neighbor.

302
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:31,916
- Monsieur.

303
00:18:34,084 --> 00:18:37,708
I would urge you to be mindful
of Madame Deroulard's feelings.

304
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,874
She has lost her son.

305
00:18:40,167 --> 00:18:42,624
- I shall be discretion itself.

306
00:18:44,334 --> 00:18:46,458
But if a crime
has been committed,

307
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:50,791
you will agree
that justice must be served.

308
00:18:51,084 --> 00:18:52,124
Ah.

309
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,541
But these were made by a guest
at your table the other night,

310
00:18:56,834 --> 00:18:58,458
le Comte du St. Alard.

311
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,624
- Yes, he always
brings a box when he visits.

312
00:19:01,917 --> 00:19:03,958
- And the night
of the death of Paul Deroulard?

313
00:19:05,084 --> 00:19:08,041
- Yes, we had some
with our coffee.

314
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,791
- What color
was the box at the table?

315
00:19:16,042 --> 00:19:17,541
- I can't remember.
- Pink.

316
00:19:18,584 --> 00:19:19,833
- Are you certain, monsieur?

317
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,208
It was not of the two colors,

318
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,041
the pink and the green,
comme ça?

319
00:19:25,334 --> 00:19:26,583
- Oh, how curious.
I wonder--

320
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,416
- I just told you.

321
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,208
Both halves were pink.

322
00:19:32,459 --> 00:19:37,958
- Then, I suggest that there is
somewhere a second box.

323
00:19:40,834 --> 00:19:42,958
One with a green lid

324
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,541
and a pink base.

325
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,124
If anyone knew the whereabouts
of the missing chocolate box,

326
00:19:50,417 --> 00:19:52,374
it would be
the Deroulard servants.

327
00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:54,166
Virginie took me to meet them.

328
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:57,291
- This is Denise, the cook,
and Jeanette, the maid.

329
00:19:57,584 --> 00:19:59,416
- Mademoiselle.

330
00:19:59,709 --> 00:20:00,749
- Where is Francois, Denise?

331
00:20:01,042 --> 00:20:04,208
- I think he's taken
the afternoon off, mademoiselle.

332
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,791
- The chocolate box comprising
the other two halves

333
00:20:07,084 --> 00:20:10,541
had been removed by the
80-year-old butler, Francois.

334
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:13,208
- That's the trouble
with going back over crimes.

335
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,708
The evidence gets lost.

336
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,291
- I agree
that is usually the case,

337
00:20:16,584 --> 00:20:19,458
but not this time,
Chief Inspector.

338
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,749
The servant Francois
had taken the box of chocolates

339
00:20:23,042 --> 00:20:25,124
to give to a lady friend.

340
00:20:25,417 --> 00:20:26,624
Over here, please,
Chief Inspector,

341
00:20:26,917 --> 00:20:28,958
between these two pillars.

342
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,708
- If we must.
- Indeed we must.

343
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,624
I have promised
most faithfully to Madame Japp

344
00:20:32,917 --> 00:20:34,208
to bring her back
the photographs.

345
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,374
Is this all right to take now?

346
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:41,916
- That should do the trick,
Poirot.

347
00:20:42,209 --> 00:20:42,999
- Bon.

348
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,499
Thank you.

349
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:51,708
- Lady friend?

350
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,583
This Francois,
you said he was nearly 80.

351
00:20:57,459 --> 00:20:58,374
- Only an Englishman would see

352
00:20:58,667 --> 00:21:00,583
the contradiction there,
mon ami.

353
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:03,583
I found them seated at a café,
playing chess,

354
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:06,499
eating what was left
of the chocolates.

355
00:21:08,584 --> 00:21:09,708
- And the fact
they were still alive

356
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,124
told you
their box wasn't poisoned.

357
00:21:12,417 --> 00:21:13,291
- Précisément.

358
00:21:13,584 --> 00:21:15,166
Merci, madame.

359
00:21:21,709 --> 00:21:22,791
But this
is the same box of chocolates

360
00:21:23,084 --> 00:21:26,041
that you handed around
on the night of our tragedy.

361
00:21:26,334 --> 00:21:27,749
The same box.

362
00:21:28,042 --> 00:21:30,874
But with a different lid,
n'est-ce pas?

363
00:21:31,167 --> 00:21:32,958
- I don't know.

364
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,291
Help yourself.

365
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:37,041
- Ah, non, merci.

366
00:21:40,167 --> 00:21:41,624
Tell me, monsieur,

367
00:21:41,917 --> 00:21:42,874
have you ever
had any disagreements

368
00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:45,416
with your employer?

369
00:21:45,709 --> 00:21:47,374
- Over what?

370
00:21:47,667 --> 00:21:49,499
- His easy ideas about religion,

371
00:21:49,792 --> 00:21:51,583
his accommodation
of the Flemish language?

372
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:56,541
I am too old to quarrel
over trivial matters, monsieur.

373
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,083
- And yet, there was an argument
over dinner, was there not,

374
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:02,958
between le Comte du St. Alard
and his host?

375
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:07,041
- Check.

376
00:22:08,584 --> 00:22:12,208
St. Alard attacked my employer
for being a liberal.

377
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,291
- And Madame Deroulard?

378
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:16,583
His mother,
she is also a liberal?

379
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:18,666
- Sadly, no.

380
00:22:18,959 --> 00:22:20,624
A good Catholic, monsieur,

381
00:22:20,917 --> 00:22:22,624
devout like St. Alard.

382
00:22:24,584 --> 00:22:25,708
- Tell me, Francois,

383
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,624
does any of the household
use poisons?

384
00:22:28,917 --> 00:22:31,333
- I do battle with the rats
from time to time,

385
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:33,916
but not in the last
three months.

386
00:22:34,209 --> 00:22:36,583
- And does anyone
take the medications perhaps?

387
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:39,458
- There are Madame's eye drops,

388
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,999
but would they be poisonous?

389
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:47,041
- Your move.

390
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:58,666
Checkmate.

391
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,791
- Bonjour, Hélène.
- Monsieur.

392
00:23:06,042 --> 00:23:07,583
Monsieur Ferraud,
s'il vous plaît.

393
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:10,333
Merci.

394
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:12,583
- C'est Monsieur Poirot.

395
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:14,624
- Ah, Hercule.

396
00:23:14,917 --> 00:23:15,999
- Jean-louis, bonjour, ça va?

397
00:23:16,292 --> 00:23:17,666
- Tell me this minute,
what is between you

398
00:23:17,959 --> 00:23:19,291
and this Virginie Mesnard?

399
00:23:19,584 --> 00:23:21,416
- Jean-Louis, your long nose
will be the death of you.

400
00:23:21,709 --> 00:23:23,416
- Your safety
is all that concerns me.

401
00:23:23,709 --> 00:23:24,874
- Thank you.

402
00:23:25,167 --> 00:23:27,291
Jean-Louis, inside this envelope
are crumbs of chocolate.

403
00:23:27,584 --> 00:23:29,041
I want you to tell me
by your analysis

404
00:23:29,334 --> 00:23:30,374
exactly what they contain,

405
00:23:30,667 --> 00:23:32,749
and whether or not
they contain poison.

406
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:36,374
Now, you're filling
a regular prescription

407
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:38,208
for Madame Deroulard?

408
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,583
For the eye drops?

409
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:40,791
- Atropine.
- Atropine?

410
00:23:41,084 --> 00:23:43,499
Now, could this atropine
kill a man?

411
00:23:43,792 --> 00:23:46,416
- If drunk by the liter,
perhaps.

412
00:23:46,709 --> 00:23:48,249
Ah, the death
of Monsieur Deroulard.

413
00:23:48,542 --> 00:23:50,416
- Oui,
and the servant Francois

414
00:23:50,709 --> 00:23:52,333
brings to you this prescription
once a month?

415
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:53,624
- That's right.

416
00:23:53,917 --> 00:23:56,624
Although last week,
their neighbor brought it.

417
00:23:58,084 --> 00:24:00,124
- Gaston Beaujeu?

418
00:24:00,417 --> 00:24:02,249
- Yes.

419
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:04,791
He required
medication of his own.

420
00:24:08,709 --> 00:24:09,708
- I waited eagerly

421
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,874
for the results
of the analysis of Jean-Louis.

422
00:24:13,167 --> 00:24:16,333
This was my first investigation
as a private detective.

423
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:19,249
But my good friend Chantalier
was about to remind me

424
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:22,374
that the day when Poirot
would rule his own destiny

425
00:24:22,667 --> 00:24:23,624
was yet to come.

426
00:24:23,917 --> 00:24:25,249
- Hercule!

427
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,333
I've been
looking everywhere for you.

428
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:35,291
- Why?
There is a problem?

429
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:38,541
- I give you my word, Hercule,
he didn't hear it from me,

430
00:24:38,834 --> 00:24:41,041
but Superintendent Boucher
wants to see you.

431
00:24:41,334 --> 00:24:42,624
- En voiture.

432
00:24:42,917 --> 00:24:44,958
- Will I need earplugs?

433
00:24:48,875 --> 00:24:51,499
- I've had
Madame Deroulard here.

434
00:24:51,792 --> 00:24:54,499
She has friends in high places,
Poirot,

435
00:24:54,792 --> 00:24:57,166
Xavier St. Alard, for one.

436
00:24:57,459 --> 00:24:59,708
He's likely to be
the next mayor of Brussels

437
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,374
and, as such, could make
my life extremely difficult,

438
00:25:04,667 --> 00:25:09,958
whereupon I will make yours
even more so.

439
00:25:16,542 --> 00:25:19,708
And what exactly
have you found out, hmm?

440
00:25:20,917 --> 00:25:22,083
Just so that we know.

441
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:23,583
- It is my belief

442
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:26,416
that Monsieur Paul Deroulard
was poisoned,

443
00:25:26,709 --> 00:25:27,708
and poisoned by a chocolate

444
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,916
made by the next mayor
of this city.

445
00:25:33,667 --> 00:25:36,083
- God in heaven, man.

446
00:25:36,375 --> 00:25:39,041
You don’t just
harass his friends.

447
00:25:39,334 --> 00:25:41,124
You accuse him of murder.

448
00:25:41,417 --> 00:25:42,874
- I accuse no one...

449
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:44,458
yet.

450
00:25:54,917 --> 00:25:56,374
- Tell us, what did Boucher say?

451
00:25:56,667 --> 00:25:57,666
- Oh, about my findings?

452
00:25:57,959 --> 00:26:00,249
He was impressed.
- Never.

453
00:26:00,542 --> 00:26:02,333
- I did not say
favorably impressed.

454
00:26:02,625 --> 00:26:04,416
- Hercule, for your own sake,

455
00:26:04,709 --> 00:26:06,291
you've got to drop this.
- Oh.

456
00:26:06,584 --> 00:26:09,874
- Please, Virginie,
make him see sense.

457
00:26:12,375 --> 00:26:14,833
- I hope I haven't made things
awkward for you.

458
00:26:15,125 --> 00:26:16,833
Hercule?

459
00:26:19,167 --> 00:26:21,833
- Not at all.

460
00:26:22,125 --> 00:26:23,874
Virginie...

461
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,708
Et bien, at 6:00,
I have coming to my apartment

462
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,249
a friend of mine
who is a chemist, eh?

463
00:26:29,542 --> 00:26:32,999
He is going to tell me exactly
what those chocolates contain.

464
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:35,041
If you are finished,
would you

465
00:26:35,334 --> 00:26:36,291
come and meet him?

466
00:26:36,584 --> 00:26:39,208
Yes?
Bon.

467
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,374
This way.

468
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:17,749
- Hercule.

469
00:27:18,042 --> 00:27:19,083
- Ouais?

470
00:27:21,417 --> 00:27:24,083
- I haven't told you
how grateful I am for your help.

471
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:25,624
- Oh, it is nothing.

472
00:27:25,917 --> 00:27:28,666
- But, uh, perhaps...

473
00:27:29,834 --> 00:27:33,833
Perhaps this will say it for me.

474
00:27:39,209 --> 00:27:40,624
- Virginie.

475
00:27:46,334 --> 00:27:47,708
Thank you.

476
00:27:55,084 --> 00:27:56,624
Oh.

477
00:27:58,792 --> 00:28:01,083
Virginie, you should not have.

478
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:07,374
- You see, some people
might have thought me mad.

479
00:28:08,875 --> 00:28:09,749
Perhaps you did.

480
00:28:10,042 --> 00:28:11,708
- No.

481
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,124
- But at least you gave me
the benefit of the doubt.

482
00:28:26,042 --> 00:28:27,708
- Merci beaucoup.

483
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:30,166
Please.

484
00:28:34,792 --> 00:28:35,624
- Hercule.
- Ah.

485
00:28:35,917 --> 00:28:38,333
- Hercule,
it is exactly as we thought.

486
00:28:38,625 --> 00:28:40,083
- Uh-huh?
- The crumbs you gave me--

487
00:28:40,375 --> 00:28:42,541
- Yes?
- Oh.

488
00:28:42,834 --> 00:28:44,666
- Ah, pardon,
Jean-Louis Ferraud,

489
00:28:44,959 --> 00:28:47,749
allow me to introduce you to
Mademoiselle Virginie Mesnard.

490
00:28:48,042 --> 00:28:49,249
- Enchanté.

491
00:28:49,542 --> 00:28:52,583
Thank you so much for everything
you're doing to help me.

492
00:28:55,625 --> 00:28:56,833
- Diable.

493
00:28:57,875 --> 00:28:58,916
Wait!

494
00:29:00,584 --> 00:29:01,374
Wait, I am the police!

495
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:02,708
Wait!

496
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,833
Stop, you!

497
00:29:24,375 --> 00:29:25,958
- Monsieur Beaujeu,
what's happening?

498
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,208
Explain yourself.

499
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,291
- My heart, Poirot.

500
00:29:29,584 --> 00:29:32,541
Pills.
The waistcoat pocket.

501
00:29:39,625 --> 00:29:40,874
- Do not worry, monsieur.

502
00:29:41,167 --> 00:29:43,333
We will get you to a hospital.

503
00:29:48,834 --> 00:29:51,083
- What was he after
in your flat?

504
00:29:51,375 --> 00:29:53,333
- The envelope containing
the crumbs of chocolate.

505
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,708
- Which weren't there anyway.

506
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,208
Had your chemist friend
done his analysis?

507
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,749
- Oh, yes.

508
00:30:07,792 --> 00:30:10,124
The crumbs contained
a substance called trinitrin.

509
00:30:10,417 --> 00:30:12,708
It is taken
for the high blood pressure.

510
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,791
And Jean-Louis had made up
an urgent prescription

511
00:30:15,084 --> 00:30:17,416
for Gaston Beaujeu
two days before the murder.

512
00:30:17,709 --> 00:30:18,541
- So you'd got him.

513
00:30:18,834 --> 00:30:20,041
- And what is more,
Chief Inspector,

514
00:30:20,334 --> 00:30:21,916
the taste of those pills
is so vile,

515
00:30:22,209 --> 00:30:24,249
that they were
made of chocolate.

516
00:30:24,542 --> 00:30:25,999
- Wait a minute.

517
00:30:26,292 --> 00:30:27,458
Why did Chantalier say

518
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:30,124
that you'd made a pig's ear
of this one, then?

519
00:30:30,417 --> 00:30:33,541
- Because that is what
I allowed him to believe.

520
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:40,041
Perhaps the time has now come
to straighten the record.

521
00:31:01,334 --> 00:31:02,458
- Bonjour.

522
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:18,041
- Poirot.

523
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:19,999
So this lot, they're all

524
00:31:20,292 --> 00:31:22,416
Compagnon de la Branche d'Or,
are they?

525
00:31:22,709 --> 00:31:24,958
- Each and every one a hero.

526
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:29,374
- Not what you'd call young,
are they?

527
00:31:31,959 --> 00:31:34,124
- Young at heart, perhaps.

528
00:31:35,042 --> 00:31:35,833
Stand up.

529
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,499
- Bienvenu
Compagnon de la Branche d'Or.

530
00:32:21,625 --> 00:32:22,791
- I did not know
that Gaston Beaujeu

531
00:32:23,084 --> 00:32:23,999
had been made a Compagnon.

532
00:32:24,292 --> 00:32:25,166
- Oh, yes.

533
00:32:25,459 --> 00:32:28,083
- I look around this hall today,

534
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:31,083
and I see nothing but heroes.

535
00:32:31,375 --> 00:32:34,041
Men who have made
great sacrifices.

536
00:32:42,042 --> 00:32:45,333
Today we honor
an English policeman

537
00:32:45,625 --> 00:32:48,666
for services
beyond the call of duty.

538
00:32:48,959 --> 00:32:52,458
And as he joins
the ranks of the invincible few,

539
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:57,791
I proclaim James Harold Japp

540
00:32:58,084 --> 00:33:01,374
a Compagnon de la Branche d'Or.

541
00:33:08,375 --> 00:33:10,916
Vive Compagnon!

542
00:33:11,209 --> 00:33:13,791
Vive le Compagnon.

543
00:33:30,792 --> 00:33:31,708
- Good evening.

544
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,624
Nice to see you.

545
00:33:33,917 --> 00:33:36,416
Ah, congratulations,
Chief Inspector.

546
00:33:36,709 --> 00:33:39,083
- It's an honor to be
one of your select company, sir.

547
00:33:39,375 --> 00:33:41,624
- Well, don't forget,
our reunion dinners

548
00:33:41,917 --> 00:33:43,208
are quite something.

549
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,958
And you must tell Madame Japp
we expect her here next time.

550
00:33:47,292 --> 00:33:49,749
- Non, merci.
Ah.

551
00:33:50,042 --> 00:33:52,333
Congratulations,
Chief Inspector Japp.

552
00:33:52,625 --> 00:33:55,874
Ah, c'est très élégant.

553
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:58,333
Come, let us have some food.

554
00:33:58,625 --> 00:34:01,041
- I think it's "help yourself"
time, Poirot.

555
00:34:01,334 --> 00:34:02,958
- Oui.

556
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,583
Merci.

557
00:34:05,875 --> 00:34:08,249
- Not a bad chap, that Beaujeu,
once you start talking.

558
00:34:08,542 --> 00:34:10,041
- No, I am sure of it.

559
00:34:10,334 --> 00:34:12,916
- Yeah, but you had him down
as a suspect at one stage.

560
00:34:13,209 --> 00:34:14,291
- Well, even the good chaps

561
00:34:14,584 --> 00:34:17,708
can sometimes kill their
fellow men, Chief Inspector.

562
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,791
- I believe
Paul Deroulard was poisoned

563
00:34:22,084 --> 00:34:23,499
with trinitrin.

564
00:34:23,792 --> 00:34:26,291
- Pills that you take
for high blood pressure.

565
00:34:26,584 --> 00:34:28,499
- Someone stole mine, Poirot.

566
00:34:28,792 --> 00:34:30,749
From the house, from my coat;
I can't be sure.

567
00:34:31,042 --> 00:34:33,749
- I would like to think
that you're innocent, monsieur.

568
00:34:34,042 --> 00:34:36,791
But you told to no one
that the pills were missing.

569
00:34:37,084 --> 00:34:38,958
And then you
broke into my apartment,

570
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:41,333
presumably to steal
the crumbs of chocolate,

571
00:34:41,625 --> 00:34:44,499
evidence which might
incriminate you.

572
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:49,791
- I'm going to take you
into my confidence, Poirot,

573
00:34:50,084 --> 00:34:53,583
which you
must promise to respect.

574
00:35:01,334 --> 00:35:03,041
- I give you my word, monsieur.

575
00:35:07,125 --> 00:35:10,374
- I work
for Belgian intelligence.

576
00:35:10,667 --> 00:35:13,458
And my present job
is to find out

577
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:18,416
just who in the government
would collaborate with Germany,

578
00:35:18,709 --> 00:35:20,541
if she wages war.

579
00:35:20,834 --> 00:35:22,916
- So Paul Deroulard
was not so much a friend

580
00:35:23,209 --> 00:35:24,999
as a mine of information.

581
00:35:25,292 --> 00:35:27,749
- Unwittingly, yes.

582
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:30,249
- Then let us hope
that for his indiscretions,

583
00:35:30,542 --> 00:35:33,124
he did not pay with his life.

584
00:35:38,125 --> 00:35:39,749
He tells me he is
a member of the secret service,

585
00:35:40,042 --> 00:35:41,499
and then he makes me promise
to keep secret

586
00:35:41,792 --> 00:35:42,791
this whole affair.

587
00:35:43,084 --> 00:35:44,583
You see how he ties my hands?

588
00:35:44,875 --> 00:35:46,041
- En voiture.

589
00:35:46,334 --> 00:35:48,666
- How do I verify his story
without breaking the confidence?

590
00:35:48,959 --> 00:35:51,208
- Well, at least
he agrees with us

591
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,874
that Paul was murdered.
- Yes.

592
00:35:53,167 --> 00:35:54,624
- Whether or not by him
is another matter.

593
00:35:54,917 --> 00:35:57,208
- He had the means
but not the motive.

594
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,124
That is why we must dig deeper.

595
00:36:00,417 --> 00:36:02,791
You know I would like to visit
the château of St. Alard, huh?

596
00:36:03,084 --> 00:36:04,291
But there is a problem.

597
00:36:04,584 --> 00:36:06,333
Monsieur le Comte
is always there.

598
00:36:06,625 --> 00:36:09,833
- There's one thing
he'll always venture out for.

599
00:36:10,125 --> 00:36:10,958
- What?

600
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:12,708
- The opera.

601
00:36:21,084 --> 00:36:22,416
- Thank you.

602
00:36:38,584 --> 00:36:40,916
- Ah, Virginie.

603
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,749
- Take care of her, monsieur.

604
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:26,624
- "Trinitrin, three times a day,
Monsieur Gaston Beaujeu."

605
00:38:26,917 --> 00:38:29,416
Found in the pocket
of Xavier St. Alard.

606
00:38:29,709 --> 00:38:31,083
Hercule, you're a genius.

607
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:33,249
Maybe so.

608
00:38:33,542 --> 00:38:35,666
- But to reopen the case,
Superintendent Boucher will need

609
00:38:35,959 --> 00:38:38,541
a confession
from St. Alard himself.

610
00:38:38,834 --> 00:38:41,708
- Hercule, I'm not sure
you'd allow me to do this,

611
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,124
but St. Alard
holds me in high regard.

612
00:38:47,417 --> 00:38:49,416
In fact, I...

613
00:38:49,709 --> 00:38:51,124
- You mean
he's in love with you?

614
00:38:51,417 --> 00:38:53,749
- Oh, please don't think I
return his affections, Hercule.

615
00:38:54,042 --> 00:38:54,958
Far, far from it.

616
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,708
- I believe you, Virginie.

617
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,041
- Then why
don't I persuade him to talk?

618
00:38:59,334 --> 00:39:00,208
- Oh, no.

619
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,083
No, Virginie, this man,
he could be a murderer.

620
00:39:02,375 --> 00:39:04,666
- If you were there...

621
00:39:07,584 --> 00:39:08,624
- Ah.

622
00:39:10,334 --> 00:39:12,333
The audacity
of the plan of Virginie

623
00:39:12,625 --> 00:39:14,541
appealed to me very much.

624
00:39:14,834 --> 00:39:16,874
That night, Francois
had taken Madame Deroulard

625
00:39:17,167 --> 00:39:18,791
to visit some friends.

626
00:39:19,084 --> 00:39:21,833
The maid and the cook were
therefore free for the evening.

627
00:39:22,125 --> 00:39:22,999
Virginie
had left the door

628
00:39:23,292 --> 00:39:25,291
at the back of the house
unlocked.

629
00:39:25,584 --> 00:39:29,666
And the trap,
it was ready to be sprung.

630
00:39:45,792 --> 00:39:46,708
- In spite of our differences,

631
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,916
Paul could be
such an amusing man.

632
00:39:56,417 --> 00:39:58,208
That was thoughtless of me.

633
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,166
I haven't mentioned his death
since it happened,

634
00:40:00,459 --> 00:40:01,291
and now is too early to do so.

635
00:40:01,584 --> 00:40:02,458
Forgive me.

636
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,749
- No, no, no.
Xavier, you misunderstand.

637
00:40:06,959 --> 00:40:08,999
You see,

638
00:40:09,292 --> 00:40:12,958
I can't help thinking that
his death was a just punishment.

639
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,916
- Virginie,

640
00:40:15,209 --> 00:40:18,041
I know the cause of his death
troubles you.

641
00:40:18,334 --> 00:40:21,999
But he died of heart failure,
Nothing else.

642
00:40:22,292 --> 00:40:25,999
- Some people do anything
for their faith, Xavier.

643
00:40:26,292 --> 00:40:28,333
I admire that.

644
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:31,249
Suppose someone knew
that Paul had plans

645
00:40:31,542 --> 00:40:34,666
to limit the church's power
in Belgium.

646
00:40:34,959 --> 00:40:37,333
Would it be a sin to remove him?

647
00:40:38,584 --> 00:40:40,291
- To murder him?

648
00:40:40,584 --> 00:40:41,916
- Oh, but such people
would never be seen

649
00:40:42,209 --> 00:40:44,166
as common murderers, though,

650
00:40:44,459 --> 00:40:46,541
but as saviors.

651
00:40:46,834 --> 00:40:49,874
Well, at least by the church,
don't you agree?

652
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:55,458
- Virginie, you say all this
to comfort me, I know.

653
00:40:57,459 --> 00:41:00,041
I had no right
to expect such understanding.

654
00:41:05,167 --> 00:41:07,458
Least of all
from a member of his family.

655
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:09,083
- What do you mean?

656
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,291
- I'm the one responsible
for his death, Virginie.

657
00:41:17,459 --> 00:41:18,791
- You killed him?

658
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:23,874
- As surely as if I had fired
a pistol at his heart.

659
00:41:33,209 --> 00:41:34,708
- Monsieur Poirot!

660
00:41:36,709 --> 00:41:39,041
What in God's name
are you doing here?

661
00:41:40,917 --> 00:41:43,666
- You break into
his private apartment.

662
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,833
Now, for most men,
that would be enough.

663
00:41:47,125 --> 00:41:48,999
But not Poirot, oh, no.

664
00:41:49,292 --> 00:41:52,124
Poirot then goes on to try
to trick him into a confession!

665
00:41:52,417 --> 00:41:53,583
- His last words,
Superintendent,

666
00:41:53,875 --> 00:41:55,833
before the return
of Madame Deroulard, were,

667
00:41:56,125 --> 00:41:58,541
"As surely as if I had fired
a pistol at his heart."

668
00:41:58,834 --> 00:42:02,291
- Yes, Poirot, "As if."

669
00:42:02,584 --> 00:42:05,458
As if, as if!

670
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:13,833
On the night
Paul Deroulard died,

671
00:42:14,125 --> 00:42:15,624
there was an argument
at the table.

672
00:42:15,917 --> 00:42:18,083
St. Alard believes that argument

673
00:42:18,375 --> 00:42:20,124
led to the seizure
that carried Paul off.

674
00:42:20,417 --> 00:42:24,208
- I believe that you yourself
should question him further.

675
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:28,291
- I do not need your advice
on how to proceed, Poirot.

676
00:42:28,584 --> 00:42:30,833
On the contrary, you need mine.

677
00:42:31,125 --> 00:42:34,333
And you will begin
by visiting Madame Deroulard

678
00:42:34,625 --> 00:42:36,083
and apologizing to her

679
00:42:36,375 --> 00:42:39,291
for all the distress
you have caused.

680
00:42:58,542 --> 00:42:59,958
- Madame Deroulard.

681
00:43:01,334 --> 00:43:03,999
I have come to apologize to you.

682
00:43:04,292 --> 00:43:06,541
- I should like you to stay,
Virginie.

683
00:43:11,084 --> 00:43:12,333
So...

684
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:16,041
you think my son was murdered.

685
00:43:16,334 --> 00:43:19,583
- I believe that your son
was poisoned, madame,

686
00:43:19,875 --> 00:43:22,083
by Xavier St. Alard.

687
00:43:22,375 --> 00:43:23,458
- Poisoned?

688
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:25,124
Would St. Alard
use his own chocolates?

689
00:43:25,417 --> 00:43:26,458
Are people so stupid?

690
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:28,208
- Oh, yes, madame.

691
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,583
You would be surprised.

692
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:32,499
The stonemason,
he murders with his hammer,

693
00:43:32,792 --> 00:43:33,833
the cutler with his knife,

694
00:43:34,125 --> 00:43:38,541
the sweet-maker
with his soft centers.

695
00:43:43,667 --> 00:43:48,416
I took some crumbs of chocolate
from this box, madame.

696
00:43:50,084 --> 00:43:51,541
May I?

697
00:43:51,834 --> 00:43:53,166
Thank you.

698
00:43:55,709 --> 00:43:58,249
They contained
a substance called trinitrin,

699
00:43:58,542 --> 00:44:01,624
a drug prescribed
to your neighbor Gaston Beaujeu.

700
00:44:01,917 --> 00:44:02,999
- And you questioned him?

701
00:44:03,292 --> 00:44:05,041
- Oui, madame,
and he told me that the pills,

702
00:44:05,334 --> 00:44:06,583
they had been stolen.

703
00:44:06,875 --> 00:44:08,499
And when I searched
the château of St. Alard,

704
00:44:08,792 --> 00:44:11,291
I found there the pill bottle,
which was empty.

705
00:44:11,584 --> 00:44:13,999
- A finding is one thing.

706
00:44:14,292 --> 00:44:15,916
Can you prove all this?

707
00:44:18,209 --> 00:44:21,124
- Tomorrow I have an appointment
with a minister of justice,

708
00:44:21,417 --> 00:44:22,999
and...

709
00:44:23,292 --> 00:44:25,374
he cannot argue
with the scientific analysis

710
00:44:25,667 --> 00:44:26,958
of Jean-Louis Ferraud.

711
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:28,999
- And all from one
little mistake.

712
00:44:29,292 --> 00:44:30,374
Francois told me.

713
00:44:30,667 --> 00:44:33,166
To do with chocolate boxes,
I believe.

714
00:44:33,459 --> 00:44:34,708
- Oui, madame.

715
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,416
Having taken a few
of the chocolates from one box,

716
00:44:37,709 --> 00:44:40,458
poisoned them, and then
put them back into another box,

717
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:43,874
the murderer
replaced the lid incorrectly.

718
00:44:49,459 --> 00:44:51,583
- The green lid on the pink box.

719
00:45:00,375 --> 00:45:03,833
- Such details are always
at the heart of a case, madame.

720
00:45:04,125 --> 00:45:08,041
You said the green lid
to the pink box.

721
00:45:08,334 --> 00:45:09,583
- Quite so.

722
00:45:14,417 --> 00:45:16,333
- Madame Deroulard,

723
00:45:16,625 --> 00:45:18,708
in order that the wrong person
does not go to the guillotine,

724
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,416
I beg of you,
tell me once again.

725
00:45:20,709 --> 00:45:21,874
What is the color of the lid,

726
00:45:22,167 --> 00:45:25,166
and what is
the color of the box?

727
00:45:25,459 --> 00:45:28,874
- My eyesight
is not what is was, monsieur.

728
00:45:30,459 --> 00:45:31,624
- Your prescription
for eye drops

729
00:45:31,917 --> 00:45:34,791
should have told me of the great
burden you carried.

730
00:45:36,125 --> 00:45:39,083
For it was you,
Madame Deroulard,

731
00:45:39,375 --> 00:45:42,416
who killed your son.

732
00:45:43,459 --> 00:45:45,666
Despite your failing eyesight,

733
00:45:45,959 --> 00:45:47,291
you added
the liquid trinitrin

734
00:45:47,584 --> 00:45:50,541
from Beaujeu's pills
to a sweet filling.

735
00:45:50,834 --> 00:45:52,916
You then put this mixture
into the chocolates

736
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:55,041
from the study of Paul.

737
00:45:55,334 --> 00:45:57,916
You replaced the glacé fruit

738
00:45:58,209 --> 00:46:01,333
to conceal
the lethal concoction within.

739
00:46:06,625 --> 00:46:09,333
Having poisoned the chocolates
which were to kill him,

740
00:46:09,625 --> 00:46:12,083
you then made
your only mistake...

741
00:46:15,959 --> 00:46:18,541
The wrong lid

742
00:46:18,834 --> 00:46:21,041
to the wrong box.

743
00:46:22,375 --> 00:46:24,374
Having used
the pills of Beaujeu,

744
00:46:24,667 --> 00:46:26,958
you then placed the pill bottle,
which was empty,

745
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:30,708
into the coat pocket
of le Comte du St. Alard.

746
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,374
Why, madame?

747
00:46:32,667 --> 00:46:34,249
To get it away from the house?

748
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:36,208
- Don't worry.

749
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,249
I wouldn't let him die
for my crime,

750
00:46:38,542 --> 00:46:40,541
much as I dislike the man.

751
00:46:40,834 --> 00:46:42,249
- Well, why, madame?

752
00:46:43,584 --> 00:46:45,583
Why kill your own son?

753
00:46:45,875 --> 00:46:48,708
- Because of what he was doing
to our country, Virginie,

754
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,541
and our church.

755
00:46:53,959 --> 00:46:56,999
I pray, monsieur,
that no woman in the world

756
00:46:57,292 --> 00:46:59,124
need ever choose again

757
00:46:59,417 --> 00:47:00,708
between love of God

758
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,416
and the love of her child.

759
00:47:02,709 --> 00:47:05,624
- But to take a life
is a mortal sin, madame.

760
00:47:05,917 --> 00:47:09,874
How can a woman of such
conviction so deny her faith?

761
00:47:10,167 --> 00:47:12,624
- Paul was a murderer, monsieur.

762
00:47:14,375 --> 00:47:16,083
She did not die
from an accident.

763
00:47:21,834 --> 00:47:23,124
- Can't you understand?

764
00:47:23,417 --> 00:47:24,958
It's our future
and Belgium's future

765
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:26,499
that I'm thinking of.

766
00:47:26,792 --> 00:47:29,583
- I married you for love, Paul,

767
00:47:29,875 --> 00:47:32,791
not to advance
your political career.

768
00:47:33,084 --> 00:47:35,874
- Marianne, come back here!

769
00:47:36,167 --> 00:47:37,749
Marianne!

770
00:47:47,792 --> 00:47:50,624
- He knew I had seen him do it,

771
00:47:50,917 --> 00:47:52,874
but we never spoke of it.

772
00:47:53,167 --> 00:47:54,083
Each of us afraid to admit

773
00:47:54,375 --> 00:47:56,708
he was capable
of doing such a thing.

774
00:47:59,709 --> 00:48:04,166
- Ah, so instead, you taunt him
by displaying the photograph.

775
00:48:08,792 --> 00:48:12,958
- Before I died,
I had to see justice done.

776
00:48:14,459 --> 00:48:15,499
My doctors tell me

777
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:19,416
I have no more than
six months left in this world.

778
00:48:21,167 --> 00:48:24,166
Will the truth wait six months,
monsieur?

779
00:48:28,959 --> 00:48:30,708
- Perhaps longer, madame.

780
00:48:31,834 --> 00:48:33,083
- No, you must tell it.

781
00:48:34,334 --> 00:48:36,833
Tell all, when I've gone.

782
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,416
- Why didn't you?

783
00:48:44,709 --> 00:48:46,666
Why leave it till now?

784
00:48:52,125 --> 00:48:54,874
- And why
did Virginie say nothing?

785
00:48:58,584 --> 00:49:01,666
- She and I agreed
that it would be my decision.

786
00:49:02,792 --> 00:49:04,666
Paul Deroulard,
he was a murderer.

787
00:49:04,959 --> 00:49:06,874
His mother acted for the greater
good of the country.

788
00:49:07,167 --> 00:49:10,166
I admired her sacrifice,
her...

789
00:49:10,459 --> 00:49:12,249
moral courage.

790
00:49:13,625 --> 00:49:16,458
Who does anything these days
for the greater good?

791
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:19,541
- At least I understand
why St. Alard bears a grudge,

792
00:49:19,834 --> 00:49:21,499
you trying to trap him
like that.

793
00:49:22,667 --> 00:49:25,291
Did you never
make your peace with him?

794
00:49:25,584 --> 00:49:27,624
- Well, had I told him
the reason why I suspected--

795
00:49:27,917 --> 00:49:29,833
- Monsieur.
- Hmm?

796
00:49:30,125 --> 00:49:31,666
Ah, merci.

797
00:49:33,084 --> 00:49:33,999
Non.

798
00:49:34,292 --> 00:49:36,458
Had I told him
the reason why I suspected him,

799
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:38,708
that I found the bottle
of trinitrin in his coat pocket,

800
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,499
he might then have asked me
who put it there.

801
00:49:40,792 --> 00:49:41,583
- Madame Deroulard.

802
00:49:41,834 --> 00:49:43,791
- I could not risk
his curiosity.

803
00:49:44,084 --> 00:49:46,458
I wrote to him, of course,
apologizing for my behavior,

804
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:49,124
which was foolhardy,
irresponsible.

805
00:49:49,417 --> 00:49:51,291
And no doubt he agrees with that
to this very day.

806
00:49:51,584 --> 00:49:52,833
Claude, would you
sit there, please?

807
00:49:53,125 --> 00:49:53,916
Chief Inspector?

808
00:49:54,167 --> 00:49:56,249
- One of those things we have
to live with in our profession.

809
00:49:56,542 --> 00:49:57,749
- Oui, bien sûr.

810
00:49:58,792 --> 00:50:00,124
Ah!

811
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:04,416
Jean-Louis.
- Hercule.

812
00:50:04,709 --> 00:50:05,499
- Oh, mon ami.

813
00:50:09,042 --> 00:50:11,041
- To see you
is to be young again.

814
00:50:11,334 --> 00:50:12,999
- I have thought about you often
down the years.

815
00:50:13,292 --> 00:50:14,666
- Oh, moi aussi, moi aussi.

816
00:50:14,959 --> 00:50:16,583
Ah, mon ami, mon ami.

817
00:50:16,875 --> 00:50:19,999
- Hercule, Hercule, I would
like you to meet my two sons.

818
00:50:20,292 --> 00:50:21,333
- Your two so--

819
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,249
- This is Henri.

820
00:50:24,542 --> 00:50:25,333
- Henri.

821
00:50:25,584 --> 00:50:27,791
- And this brave fellow
is Hercule.

822
00:50:29,917 --> 00:50:31,208
- Hercule?

823
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:34,541
You are indeed fortunate
to have such fine sons.

824
00:50:36,334 --> 00:50:39,166
Henri, he has
a look of someone, yes?

825
00:50:39,459 --> 00:50:40,791
Though, perhaps I am wrong.

826
00:50:41,084 --> 00:50:42,499
No, I am right.
Hercule also.

827
00:50:42,792 --> 00:50:45,624
There is a definite resemblance
to someone I know.

828
00:50:46,792 --> 00:50:49,666
- My wife, perhaps?

829
00:50:52,042 --> 00:50:53,458
- Virginie.

830
00:51:05,542 --> 00:51:06,999
- Hello, Hercule.

831
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:09,874
- Bon soir...

832
00:51:10,917 --> 00:51:12,833
Madame Ferraud.

833
00:51:15,917 --> 00:51:20,083
I was just saying
to Jean-Louis

834
00:51:20,375 --> 00:51:23,374
that he was always

835
00:51:23,667 --> 00:51:25,958
the most fortunate of men.
