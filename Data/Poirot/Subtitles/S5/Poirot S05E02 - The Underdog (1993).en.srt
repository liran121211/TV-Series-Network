That such a philistine

a knighthood,

269

Well, I'm not going to work
in his blasted factory.

363
00:22:29,924 --> 00:22:31,977
I know all the facts
are against him,

364
00:22:32,505 --> 00:22:36,662
but I tell you, Mr. Poirot,
I tell you he's innocent.

365
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,977
And the reason for your
certainty, Lady Astwell?

366
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:40,804
Intuition.

367
00:22:41,106 --> 00:22:44,159
Ah, yes, the female intuition,
huh?

368
00:22:44,418 --> 00:22:46,864
Lady Astwell,
if you'd be so kind,

369
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,552
the will of your husband
and his estate,

370
00:22:50,811 --> 00:22:52,262
to whom was it left?

371
00:22:52,562 --> 00:22:55,572
Uh, half to me,
half to Victor.

372
00:22:55,835 --> 00:22:58,358
And Monsieur Leverson?

373
00:22:59,794 --> 00:23:02,272
Well, his mother,
Rueben's sister,

374
00:23:02,534 --> 00:23:04,212
knew that he was
a bit scatterbrained,

375
00:23:04,475 --> 00:23:06,271
so she left her estate
in Rueben's hands

376
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:07,559
on condition
that he made Charles

377
00:23:07,861 --> 00:23:09,312
a reasonable allowance.

378
00:23:09,612 --> 00:23:11,107
It was almost
a deathbed promise.

379
00:23:11,363 --> 00:23:12,738
Which he kept?

380
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,555
Until yesterday...

381
00:23:15,816 --> 00:23:18,190
Well, my husband threatened to
cut Charles off without a penny

382
00:23:18,459 --> 00:23:20,420
unless he took a job
with the firm.

383
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,022
I see.

384
00:23:23,783 --> 00:23:25,318
Tell me, Lady Astwell,
last night,

385
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:28,044
you came to the study
to see your husband.

386
00:23:28,302 --> 00:23:30,491
About what?

387
00:23:30,791 --> 00:23:33,558
Oh, oh, that was just
some domestic matter.

388
00:23:33,817 --> 00:23:36,431
You had a quarrel.

389
00:23:41,361 --> 00:23:45,773
He was making the most
absurd allegations against Lily,

390
00:23:46,072 --> 00:23:48,687
accusing her of interfering
with his private papers,

391
00:23:48,983 --> 00:23:50,977
spying.

392
00:23:51,243 --> 00:23:52,823
Lily's a dear girl.

393
00:23:53,081 --> 00:23:56,229
I regard her as I would
a favorite niece.

394
00:23:56,528 --> 00:23:58,031
Charles is very fond of her.

395
00:23:58,328 --> 00:24:01,247
You know she came
with excellent references.

396
00:24:01,507 --> 00:24:03,316
Might I see these references?

397
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:05,187
Is that really necessary?

398
00:24:05,451 --> 00:24:08,174
Just to satisfy my curiosity.

399
00:24:08,439 --> 00:24:11,435
[applause]

400
00:24:12,805 --> 00:24:15,376
I've come to see Mr. Naylor.

401
00:24:15,677 --> 00:24:17,823
Mr. Naylor appears to be out
at the moment, miss.

402
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,626
I don't know when he'll be back.

403
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:21,317
Can I take a message?

404
00:24:21,576 --> 00:24:23,765
Oh, well.

405
00:24:24,027 --> 00:24:25,563
Please give him this
when he returns.

406
00:24:25,827 --> 00:24:26,785
He's expecting it.

407
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:28,517
Certainly, miss.

408
00:24:37,968 --> 00:24:39,928
I don't know what things
are coming to, Gladys.

409
00:24:40,189 --> 00:24:43,598
Policemen and detectives
all over the place.

410
00:24:43,866 --> 00:24:45,555
Expect it will be the press
next

411
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:46,821
Oh, well, do you think

412
00:24:47,083 --> 00:24:49,120
I'll get my picture
in the paper, Mr. Parsons?

413
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,264
[knocks lightly]

414
00:24:50,529 --> 00:24:52,338
Monsieur Parsons,
a word with you, if I may?

415
00:24:52,598 --> 00:24:53,752
Certainly, sir.

416
00:24:57,577 --> 00:24:58,764
Excuse me.

417
00:25:00,717 --> 00:25:02,177
Monsieur Parsons,

418
00:25:02,479 --> 00:25:04,941
I understand that last night
you heard Monsieur Leverson

419
00:25:05,198 --> 00:25:07,083
having the arguments
with Sir Rueben.

420
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:09,298
Yes, sir, I heard him cry out.

421
00:25:09,564 --> 00:25:11,329
Then there was a heavy thud.

422
00:25:11,594 --> 00:25:15,276
Mr. Leverson shouted, "My God".

423
00:25:15,539 --> 00:25:19,297
Did you try to ascertain
the reason for this disturbance?

424
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,486
I did, sir.

425
00:25:20,786 --> 00:25:21,669
I went out of my room

426
00:25:21,935 --> 00:25:26,685
and listened at the foot
of the back stairs.

427
00:25:26,952 --> 00:25:30,329
I heard Mr. Leverson call out,
"No harm done,"

428
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:34,153
and then he went off, whistling,
as cheery as you like, sir.

429
00:25:34,421 --> 00:25:35,608
Ow!

430
00:25:35,876 --> 00:25:37,260
What have you done now, girl?

431
00:25:37,522 --> 00:25:38,601
Cut myself.

432
00:25:38,902 --> 00:25:40,482
There's a bit of metal
sticking out of the table.

433
00:25:40,778 --> 00:25:41,966
Allow me, mademoiselle.

434
00:25:43,076 --> 00:25:44,078
<i>Voilà.</i>

435
00:25:51,501 --> 00:25:53,037
Monsieur Parsons,

436
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:56,674
have you noticed if any
of your cutlery, it is damaged?

437
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:57,866
As it happens,

438
00:25:58,166 --> 00:25:59,975
one of the knives
is missing its point, sir.

439
00:26:00,234 --> 00:26:01,694
Hm, I think
you will find it here,

440
00:26:01,995 --> 00:26:03,684
embedded in the table.

441
00:26:03,987 --> 00:26:05,719
Oh, thank you, sir.
I'll see to it.

442
00:26:05,979 --> 00:26:07,744
And you get a bandage
around that, Gladys.

443
00:26:08,008 --> 00:26:09,435
Yes, Mr. Parsons.

444
00:26:09,732 --> 00:26:11,158
I'll wash your handkerchief
for you, sir.

445
00:26:11,455 --> 00:26:13,068
No, no, no, no,
Mademoiselle Gladys, thank you.

446
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:14,983
There is no need.
You are most kind.

447
00:26:15,286 --> 00:26:16,288
Oh.

448
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:45,895
Your business discussion
last night

449
00:26:46,154 --> 00:26:48,497
with Sir Rueben, your brother,
it was friendly?

450
00:26:48,797 --> 00:26:50,834
Why should it have been
otherwise?

451
00:26:51,095 --> 00:26:52,936
Because I detected
at the dinner table

452
00:26:53,202 --> 00:26:54,856
a certain tension.

453
00:26:55,116 --> 00:26:57,033
Yes, well, we did have
a disagreement.

454
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,073
A quarrel?

455
00:26:58,372 --> 00:26:59,331
I wouldn't call it that.

456
00:26:59,597 --> 00:27:01,057
A heated argument.

457
00:27:02,393 --> 00:27:03,896
It was over this.

458
00:27:06,376 --> 00:27:10,254
We have developed
a synthetic rubber, Astoprene.

459
00:27:10,512 --> 00:27:13,083
Remarkable stuff, made from oil.

460
00:27:13,346 --> 00:27:14,850
Amazing properties.

461
00:27:15,108 --> 00:27:17,646
Strong as mild steel.

462
00:27:17,904 --> 00:27:19,091
High abrasion factor.

463
00:27:19,398 --> 00:27:21,664
Ideal for motor tires.

464
00:27:24,492 --> 00:27:29,209
Rueben intended to license
its manufacture to I.G. Farben.

465
00:27:29,471 --> 00:27:30,353
You've heard of them?

466
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,502
Yes, of course.

467
00:27:31,768 --> 00:27:34,568
They are the largest chemical
manufacturers in Germany.

468
00:27:34,871 --> 00:27:36,832
Do you have the objections?

469
00:27:37,092 --> 00:27:38,781
It's all academic now.

470
00:27:39,045 --> 00:27:41,344
I'm canceling the transaction.

471
00:27:47,433 --> 00:27:51,420
I will be with you in just
a moment, Monsieur Poirot.

472
00:27:51,684 --> 00:27:53,906
Please, Monsieur Trefusis,
do not hurry yourself.

473
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:55,524
We both know how important it is

474
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:58,282
to weigh things most carefully,
huh?

475
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:09,537
I am at your disposal.

476
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:11,183
<i>Merci.</i>

477
00:28:11,446 --> 00:28:12,906
I am trying to establish
where everyone was

478
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:15,168
at the time of the murder
of Sir Rueben.

479
00:28:15,429 --> 00:28:17,314
I was sound asleep in bed.

480
00:28:17,574 --> 00:28:19,535
I retired
shortly after you left.

481
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:21,109
And you departed
early in the morning?

482
00:28:21,365 --> 00:28:23,250
Yes, before breakfast.

483
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:25,967
Last night, you talked
at dinner

484
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:28,725
about the scientific
developments in Germany.

485
00:28:29,907 --> 00:28:30,755
Did I?

486
00:28:31,017 --> 00:28:32,521
You are fluent
in the language?

487
00:28:33,508 --> 00:28:34,511
Well, I should be.

488
00:28:34,773 --> 00:28:37,618
I worked and studied in Germany
for a number of years.

489
00:28:37,915 --> 00:28:39,529
You have there
a number of friends?

490
00:28:39,832 --> 00:28:43,669
Oh, I keep in touch
with colleagues.

491
00:28:45,082 --> 00:28:48,494
Well, if you have no further
questions, Monsieur Poirot...

492
00:28:49,873 --> 00:28:51,377
Thank you, Monsieur Trefusis.

493
00:28:51,636 --> 00:28:54,099
I am very sorry
to have disturbed you.

494
00:28:57,691 --> 00:28:59,152
A vintage year, you would say?

495
00:29:09,226 --> 00:29:11,876
This is the parcel you've been
waiting for, sir.

496
00:29:12,139 --> 00:29:14,559
Thank you.
I've enjoyed my stay.

497
00:29:14,822 --> 00:29:16,054
My car is just outside.

498
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:18,698
[dramatic music]

499
00:29:18,961 --> 00:29:26,973
<i>[music]</i>

500
00:29:31,033 --> 00:29:32,766
[engine turning over]

501
00:29:52,571 --> 00:29:55,144
"Exhibition Road, London".

502
00:29:59,584 --> 00:30:00,620
So you say
this Monsieur Naylor

503
00:30:00,887 --> 00:30:02,468
took the parcel with him
when he left the hotel?

504
00:30:02,727 --> 00:30:03,457
Yes.

505
00:30:03,723 --> 00:30:05,228
Thank you, Hastings.

506
00:30:05,486 --> 00:30:06,445
Is that blood, Poirot?

507
00:30:06,713 --> 00:30:08,675
Yes, Hastings,
but it is not mine.

508
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:11,013
Gladys, the maid,
she cut her finger

509
00:30:11,273 --> 00:30:12,429
when she found the tip
of a knife

510
00:30:12,691 --> 00:30:15,231
embedded in the table where
Victor Astwell, he was seated.

511
00:30:15,489 --> 00:30:17,604
You don't suspect him, do you?

512
00:30:17,865 --> 00:30:18,901
It is by no means certain

513
00:30:19,168 --> 00:30:21,315
that your friend Charles
is the murderer, Hastings.

514
00:30:21,621 --> 00:30:24,084
Indeed, Lady Astwell is deeply
convinced that he is not.

515
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,110
I've never known you

516
00:30:25,415 --> 00:30:28,217
to place much faith
in intuition.

517
00:30:28,481 --> 00:30:31,740
Intuition, Hastings,
often describes some fact

518
00:30:32,045 --> 00:30:35,043
that is so deeply buried
in the subconscious

519
00:30:35,303 --> 00:30:38,301
that the subject is not aware
of its existence.

520
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,131
What fact?

521
00:30:42,393 --> 00:30:43,625
<i>Et bien,</i> Hastings.

522
00:30:43,887 --> 00:30:46,809
If I knew that, the case,
it would be solved.

523
00:30:47,068 --> 00:30:48,758
Lily Margrave's references.

524
00:30:49,023 --> 00:30:51,792
Lady Astwell sent them
by special delivery.

525
00:30:52,089 --> 00:30:53,745
Thank you, Miss Lemon.

526
00:31:04,046 --> 00:31:06,695
It is indeed most fulsome
in its presence.

527
00:31:07,802 --> 00:31:09,383
Exactement, that is the crest

528
00:31:09,641 --> 00:31:11,788
of the Noble Duchess
of Perthshire.

529
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:21,295
How interesting.

530
00:31:28,863 --> 00:31:29,821
[telephone ringing]

531
00:31:30,069 --> 00:31:30,879
Tell the truth, Charles.

532
00:31:31,146 --> 00:31:33,149
What have you got to lose?

533
00:31:35,917 --> 00:31:38,423
[ringing continues]

534
00:31:38,726 --> 00:31:40,422
Oh.

535
00:31:44,381 --> 00:31:47,160
When I arrived back
from the golf club,

536
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:50,233
I went up to his study.

537
00:31:50,498 --> 00:31:53,693
I was in a bit of a temper,

538
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,086
and I wanted to have it out
with the old devil.

539
00:31:57,347 --> 00:32:00,816
I went into his study,
and he was sitting at his desk.

540
00:32:01,078 --> 00:32:02,818
Well, at least
that's how it looked.

541
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:07,511
I've just about had as much
as I'm going to take of you,

542
00:32:07,773 --> 00:32:10,432
you swine.

543
00:32:10,696 --> 00:32:13,356
Do you hear?

544
00:32:13,621 --> 00:32:20,165
Oh, don't like it when someone
stands up to you, do you?

545
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:23,013
...When someone stands up
to you, do you?

546
00:32:23,277 --> 00:32:25,168
Nothing to say?

547
00:32:27,081 --> 00:32:28,393
Oh.

548
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,618
Oh, God.

549
00:32:30,886 --> 00:32:32,471
So when you found him,

550
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:35,387
Monsieur Astwell was, in fact,
already dead.

551
00:32:36,881 --> 00:32:39,505
But why on Earth
did you make a run for it?

552
00:32:39,762 --> 00:32:44,604
Well, when the maid
saw the blood, I...

553
00:32:44,912 --> 00:32:46,453
I just panicked.

554
00:32:48,064 --> 00:32:50,293
You see, I knew you wouldn't
believe me.

555
00:32:50,599 --> 00:32:52,949
I mean, who would?

556
00:32:53,212 --> 00:32:55,027
Poirot might.

557
00:33:04,433 --> 00:33:06,586
[brakes squealing]

558
00:33:10,851 --> 00:33:11,856
You do realize

559
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:14,850
I can't guarantee any results,
Mr. Poirot.

560
00:33:15,116 --> 00:33:18,078
I have the most complete faith
in you, Miss Lemon.

561
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:23,271
You are sleepy.

562
00:33:23,532 --> 00:33:27,609
Very sleepy.

563
00:33:27,873 --> 00:33:30,453
[yawns]

564
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:34,039
Your eyelids are heavy.

565
00:33:36,846 --> 00:33:40,091
They are closing... closing...

566
00:33:40,353 --> 00:33:42,282
This really is quite absurd.

567
00:33:43,706 --> 00:33:45,602
Relax.

568
00:33:45,864 --> 00:33:49,186
You are going to sleep.

569
00:34:07,486 --> 00:34:10,533
Lady Astwell,
you are now asleep.

570
00:34:10,801 --> 00:34:15,011
You can hear me,
and you can answer my questions.

571
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:16,121
I can hear you.

572
00:34:16,427 --> 00:34:18,939
I can answer your questions.

573
00:34:21,939 --> 00:34:24,604
It is the night of the murder.

574
00:34:24,906 --> 00:34:28,886
You are seated
at the dining table.

575
00:34:29,146 --> 00:34:32,347
Describe to me what you saw
and what you felt.

576
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:34,199
I...

577
00:34:34,465 --> 00:34:37,557
I'm in great distress,

578
00:34:37,818 --> 00:34:39,594
worried about Lily.

579
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:44,410
Victor's looking at Rueben
in an angry way.

580
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:47,190
Tell me about Victor.

581
00:34:47,453 --> 00:34:49,043
Such a dear man.

582
00:34:50,074 --> 00:34:52,738
We love each other very much.

583
00:35:01,791 --> 00:35:03,874
It is later in the evening.

584
00:35:04,142 --> 00:35:05,183
We're in business
to make money.

585
00:35:05,491 --> 00:35:08,122
You go to the study.

586
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,700
Is Victor there?

587
00:35:10,964 --> 00:35:14,132
No, he's just coming out.

588
00:35:14,394 --> 00:35:16,477
He looks pale and angry.

589
00:35:16,745 --> 00:35:19,179
He's insufferable.

590
00:35:19,442 --> 00:35:21,032
You enter the study.

591
00:35:21,293 --> 00:35:22,762
You have a terrible scene
with your husband.

592
00:35:23,027 --> 00:35:24,727
...Is going, and that's all
there is to it.

593
00:35:24,993 --> 00:35:26,078
Don't I have any say
in the matter?

594
00:35:26,341 --> 00:35:27,657
Paid companions
are ten a penny.

595
00:35:27,922 --> 00:35:29,665
You can get another one.

596
00:35:29,925 --> 00:35:32,591
Very soon,
he will be murdered.

597
00:35:32,855 --> 00:35:35,928
Do you know who murdered
your husband, Lady Astwell?

598
00:35:37,183 --> 00:35:38,337
It wasn't Charles.

599
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,831
How do you know?

600
00:35:40,132 --> 00:35:41,319
Because of the curtain.

601
00:35:41,586 --> 00:35:42,665
Don't I have any say
in the matter?

602
00:35:42,965 --> 00:35:44,959
Paid companions
are ten a penny.

603
00:35:45,225 --> 00:35:46,532
Curtain?
What about the curtain?

604
00:35:46,834 --> 00:35:50,133
[muttering indistinctly]

605
00:35:50,395 --> 00:35:51,389
The shape.

606
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:53,155
Shape?

607
00:35:53,459 --> 00:35:54,307
The...

608
00:35:54,607 --> 00:35:56,143
Is there someone
behind the curtain?

609
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:57,719
Who is behind the curtain,
Lady Astwell?

610
00:35:57,977 --> 00:35:59,589
Really, Mr. Poirot,
this has gone on long enough.

611
00:35:59,854 --> 00:36:00,779
<i>S'il vous plaît,</i>mademoiselle.

612
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:02,735
She's in distress.
Can't you see that?

613
00:36:03,032 --> 00:36:04,219
Lady Astwell, the curtain.

614
00:36:04,487 --> 00:36:07,025
Is there someone
behind the curtain?

615
00:36:07,283 --> 00:36:08,361
Oh.

616
00:36:08,623 --> 00:36:10,235
Oh, it's too late.
She's coming out of it.

617
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,926
[sighs]

618
00:36:12,184 --> 00:36:13,263
Have I been having a nap?

619
00:36:13,563 --> 00:36:16,330
That's it, just a little nap.

620
00:36:16,627 --> 00:36:18,468
Did I...

621
00:36:18,734 --> 00:36:21,729
Did I say anything?

622
00:36:21,988 --> 00:36:23,644
Not as much
as I could have wished.

623
00:36:37,957 --> 00:36:38,840
On the evening of the tragedy,

624
00:36:39,106 --> 00:36:40,457
I understand that you had
retired to bed

625
00:36:40,715 --> 00:36:42,066
before Lady Astwell
went to the study,

626
00:36:42,362 --> 00:36:43,473
is that not so?

627
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,124
Yes.

628
00:36:51,361 --> 00:36:54,160
Did you, by any chance,
leave your room again?

629
00:36:54,425 --> 00:36:55,579
No.

630
00:36:58,254 --> 00:37:01,327
Did you go into the study
at any time during the evening?

631
00:37:01,624 --> 00:37:04,271
No, not at any time.

632
00:37:07,483 --> 00:37:08,332
How curious.

633
00:37:08,594 --> 00:37:11,208
In what way, Mr. Poirot?

634
00:37:12,385 --> 00:37:15,610
As I recall, that evening

635
00:37:15,909 --> 00:37:19,743
you wore a dress
of green chiffon.

636
00:37:21,844 --> 00:37:23,914
Such a pity it has been torn.

637
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,218
[gasps]

638
00:37:26,517 --> 00:37:27,900
Where did you find that?

639
00:37:28,201 --> 00:37:29,856
Did you go into the study
again after dinner?

640
00:37:30,154 --> 00:37:32,420
No.
Yes.

641
00:37:32,682 --> 00:37:34,294
I may have.

642
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:36,367
Yes, I remember now.

643
00:37:36,626 --> 00:37:38,282
I was in the study
the previous evening,

644
00:37:38,541 --> 00:37:41,689
and I was wearing
the same dress.

645
00:37:41,949 --> 00:37:43,529
Ah, the same dress.

646
00:37:43,788 --> 00:37:44,790
- Hmm.
- Ah.

647
00:37:47,656 --> 00:37:49,420
How sad that you appear
to have spilled onto it

648
00:37:49,685 --> 00:37:52,060
some of Sir Rueben's
most excellent wine.

649
00:37:54,281 --> 00:37:55,784
Or is it blood?

650
00:38:08,106 --> 00:38:10,795
[dramatic music]

651
00:38:11,054 --> 00:38:12,057
<i>[music]</i>

652
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:13,587
She's making a run for it,
Poirot.

653
00:38:13,849 --> 00:38:15,887
It must have something to do
with that parcel.

654
00:38:16,185 --> 00:38:17,373
I think I know
where she's going.

655
00:38:17,641 --> 00:38:19,940
Exhibition Road.
She'll catch the 1:15.

656
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:24,462
You are sure of the timetable,
Hastings?

657
00:38:24,764 --> 00:38:25,574
Absolutely positive.

658
00:38:25,879 --> 00:38:27,192
Bon, then we have
just the time.

659
00:38:27,457 --> 00:38:29,119
But you must drive
like the winds.

660
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,349
I'm depending on you
to navigate.

661
00:38:46,266 --> 00:38:47,349
When's the next train
to London?

662
00:38:47,612 --> 00:38:51,234
[whistle shrieking]

663
00:38:51,767 --> 00:38:54,316
[wheels clanking]

664
00:38:54,614 --> 00:38:57,425

667
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,858
Exhibition Road, please.

668
00:40:02,506 --> 00:40:04,015
Where is this Exhibition Road,
Hastings?

669
00:40:04,275 --> 00:40:05,937
It should be up here
on the right.

670
00:40:06,198 --> 00:40:07,741
It's full of museums
and colleges.

671
00:40:08,006 --> 00:40:10,282
But for us,
only one that matters.

672
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:17,971
[brakes squealing]

673
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:26,436
<i>Vite,</i> Hastings.
<i>Vite.</i>

674
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:32,979
A hurried departure,
Mademoiselle Margrave?

675
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,746
If that is indeed your name.

676
00:40:55,088 --> 00:40:59,093
My real name is Lily Naylor.

677
00:40:59,358 --> 00:41:01,098
Humphrey's my brother.

678
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:02,671
And you, Monsieur Naylor,

679
00:41:02,935 --> 00:41:05,212
are a research fellow
here at the Imperial College?

680
00:41:05,513 --> 00:41:08,861
Yes, in polymer chemistry.

681
00:41:09,167 --> 00:41:10,600
The molecular forms
of repeating units-

682
00:41:10,859 --> 00:41:13,169
- We are talking
about synthetic rubber.

683
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:15,986
In this instance, yes.

684
00:41:18,245 --> 00:41:21,287
I made a breakthrough
with one compound.

685
00:41:21,553 --> 00:41:25,131
It wasn't perfect,
but it was nearly there.

686
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,119
The trouble was that it needed
commercial investment

687
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:30,411
to develop its potential.

688
00:41:33,048 --> 00:41:34,124
[rubber snapping]

689
00:41:34,386 --> 00:41:37,072
So I approached
Astwell Chemicals.

690
00:41:37,331 --> 00:41:41,356
At first, they showed
some interest in my work.

691
00:41:41,613 --> 00:41:42,767
Then, after a while,

692
00:41:43,028 --> 00:41:45,562
Sir Rueben told me that they had
lost interest entirely.

693
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:48,158
Sorry, Naylor, we're not
prepared to go that far.

694
00:41:50,447 --> 00:41:52,437
I believed them at first.

695
00:41:52,703 --> 00:41:55,161
Then my suspicions
became aroused

696
00:41:55,418 --> 00:41:58,333
by odd little reports
in scientific journals.

697
00:41:58,592 --> 00:42:00,278
They wouldn't have meant much
to anyone

698
00:42:00,542 --> 00:42:01,891
who wasn't expert
in the subject.

699
00:42:02,148 --> 00:42:02,996
Hello, George?

700
00:42:03,257 --> 00:42:04,290
Yes, have you seen
the current issue...

701
00:42:04,557 --> 00:42:06,928
I made certain inquiries
and became convinced

702
00:42:07,195 --> 00:42:10,110
that Astwell's were using
my basic research.

703
00:42:10,407 --> 00:42:11,593
He was swindling me.

704
00:42:11,861 --> 00:42:15,461
But... I had no proof.

705
00:42:17,521 --> 00:42:20,240
And you, Mademoiselle...
Naylor

706
00:42:20,503 --> 00:42:22,037
and your references?

707
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,529
They are genuine?

708
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:27,050
Oh, yes, completely so.

709
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:29,953
I was employed
by the Duchess of Perthshire.

710
00:42:30,216 --> 00:42:32,935
The Astwells would have
recognized the name Naylor,

711
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:37,680
and so I changed my name
on the references.

712
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:46,479
And by this subterfuge,

713
00:42:46,774 --> 00:42:49,231
you were able to obtain
the Astoprene file.

714
00:43:14,345 --> 00:43:15,420
Monsieur Astwell,

715
00:43:15,683 --> 00:43:18,054
would you be so kind as to tell
us about Monsieur Naylor?

716
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,545
I understand
you and your brother

717
00:43:19,813 --> 00:43:21,466
stole his research.

718
00:43:21,725 --> 00:43:23,225
I tried to argue with Rueben,

719
00:43:23,484 --> 00:43:26,431
but he said that Naylofs work
was unproven.

720
00:43:26,696 --> 00:43:28,001
Our labs took over
the whole thing.

721
00:43:28,264 --> 00:43:31,027
Well, I agree there were some
problems still to be solved-

722
00:43:31,284 --> 00:43:32,285
Let us, if you please,

723
00:43:32,547 --> 00:43:35,081
go back to the night
of the murder of Sir Rueben.

724
00:43:35,338 --> 00:43:36,916
Lady Astwell,

725
00:43:37,173 --> 00:43:38,979
when you were in the trance
of the hypnotics,

726
00:43:39,239 --> 00:43:41,425
you said that you saw something
behind the curtain.

727
00:43:41,685 --> 00:43:44,905
Notnot the window curtains.

728
00:43:45,204 --> 00:43:46,204
It was that curtain.

729
00:43:46,466 --> 00:43:48,348
[gasps]
Oh, my God.

730
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:49,760
Calm yourself, madame.

731
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:52,475
Captain Hastings.

732
00:43:52,776 --> 00:43:54,234
Thank you.

733
00:43:54,496 --> 00:43:57,203
Perhaps you can tell us who was
hiding behind the curtain,

734
00:43:57,501 --> 00:43:58,784
Monsieur Naylor?

735
00:43:59,042 --> 00:44:00,632
It wasn't me.

736
00:44:02,009 --> 00:44:02,821
I told you,

737
00:44:03,088 --> 00:44:04,524
after I'd met Lily
in the garden,

738
00:44:04,784 --> 00:44:06,296
I went back to my hotel.

739
00:44:08,984 --> 00:44:11,220
But there was indeed
an intruder.

740
00:44:11,488 --> 00:44:13,187
And on first entering the study,

741
00:44:13,454 --> 00:44:17,848
this intruder had no thought
of murder.

742
00:44:18,116 --> 00:44:21,622
It was solely for the purpose
of making the search.

743
00:44:23,318 --> 00:44:24,677
But suddenly...

744
00:44:24,935 --> 00:44:25,790
All I'm saying...

745
00:44:26,053 --> 00:44:27,292
There was the sound
of approaching voices

746
00:44:27,595 --> 00:44:29,414
and footsteps.

747
00:44:29,675 --> 00:44:33,456
And there was to be found
only one place to hide,

748
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,573
the small bedroom
attached to the study

749
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,546
that Monsieur Astwell uses
when he works late at night.

750
00:44:38,807 --> 00:44:40,889
I don't want to hear any more
of this sentimental...

751
00:44:41,157 --> 00:44:44,094
Monsieur Victor Astwell and
Sir Rueben enter the study.

752
00:44:44,355 --> 00:44:46,636
They do not see anybody
hiding behind the curtain,

753
00:44:46,898 --> 00:44:48,291
and the two men quarrel
violently.

754
00:44:48,593 --> 00:44:52,178
What we are selling them will
be used for military purposes.

755
00:44:52,485 --> 00:44:53,527
Victor.

756
00:44:53,795 --> 00:44:55,385
[door slams]

757
00:44:55,645 --> 00:44:59,810
Monsieur Victor Astwell
leaves in anger.

758
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:03,775
But for our intruder,
there's no way to escape.

759
00:45:04,083 --> 00:45:05,629
What a dilemma.

760
00:45:05,932 --> 00:45:08,136
If Sir Rueben decides to spend
the night in the little bedroom,

761
00:45:08,398 --> 00:45:11,752
discovery must surely follow.

762
00:45:12,021 --> 00:45:13,379
Lady Astwell enters the study

763
00:45:13,678 --> 00:45:15,913
to protest at the dismissal
of Mademoiselle Naylor.

764
00:45:16,182 --> 00:45:17,191
That's all there is to it.

765
00:45:17,192 --> 00:45:18,046
Well, don't I have any say-

766
00:45:18,301 --> 00:45:19,660
- Paid companions
are ten a penny.

767
00:45:19,919 --> 00:45:21,312
You can get another one.

768
00:45:21,576 --> 00:45:27,133
When Lady Astwell leaves,
Sir Rueben, he is alone.

769
00:45:27,394 --> 00:45:28,325
Now is the only moment

770
00:45:28,589 --> 00:45:32,337
for our intruder to escape
without detection.

771
00:45:32,596 --> 00:45:35,610
But Sir Rueben hears a noise.

772
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:37,883
What the...

773
00:45:38,144 --> 00:45:39,145
<i>Et voilà.</i>

774
00:45:39,146 --> 00:45:40,461
[grunting]

775
00:45:40,765 --> 00:45:44,533
An act of impulse
followed by blind panic.

776
00:45:44,797 --> 00:45:48,369
Now our intruder must escape.

777
00:45:48,637 --> 00:45:49,598
But it is not to be.

778
00:45:49,865 --> 00:45:53,437
Is there no way out
of this accursed room?

779
00:45:53,706 --> 00:45:55,749
Monsieur Charles Leverson
enters the study.

780
00:45:56,049 --> 00:45:59,205
...When someone
stands up to you, do you?

781
00:45:59,466 --> 00:46:02,393
Nothing to say?

782
00:46:02,692 --> 00:46:06,155
And on seeing that Sir Rueben
is dead, he leaves.

783
00:46:06,416 --> 00:46:09,454
Then Mademoiselle Naylor
enters the study,

784
00:46:09,719 --> 00:46:12,494
and finding the body
of Sir Rueben,

785
00:46:12,753 --> 00:46:13,911
seizes her opportunity

786
00:46:14,212 --> 00:46:17,446
to take a file that is
so important to her brother.

787
00:46:21,931 --> 00:46:23,045
Lily's told you what happened.

788
00:46:23,313 --> 00:46:24,165
He was trying to cheat me.

789
00:46:24,427 --> 00:46:25,934
But she didn't murder him.

790
00:46:29,995 --> 00:46:32,267
<i>Mesdames et messieurs,</i>

791
00:46:32,568 --> 00:46:34,687
I am a student
of the psychology,

792
00:46:34,949 --> 00:46:36,337
and throughout this case,

793
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,905
I have been looking
not for a man or woman

794
00:46:39,211 --> 00:46:40,216
who has the bad temper,

795
00:46:40,479 --> 00:46:43,363
because the bad temper is,
in itself, a safety valve.

796
00:46:43,627 --> 00:46:47,778
No, I have been looking
for a person

797
00:46:48,044 --> 00:46:50,819
who has the patience,

798
00:46:51,077 --> 00:46:54,496
who has for too long played
the part of the underdog,

799
00:46:54,763 --> 00:46:57,069
who crept into the study
of Sir Rueben,

800
00:46:57,375 --> 00:46:59,069
who hid behind the curtain,

801
00:46:59,372 --> 00:47:02,256
who became trapped

802
00:47:02,521 --> 00:47:04,335
and finally committed
the act of violence

803
00:47:04,594 --> 00:47:06,747
that had been harbored
for so long.

804
00:47:09,587 --> 00:47:12,208
It was you who was hiding
behind the curtain.

805
00:47:12,467 --> 00:47:15,930
It was you who murdered
Sir Rueben Astwell,

806
00:47:16,191 --> 00:47:18,190
Monsieur Trefusis.

807
00:47:20,185 --> 00:47:22,381
You waited until the house
was silent and empty.

808
00:47:22,643 --> 00:47:24,762
You then crept back
to your bedroom,

809
00:47:25,024 --> 00:47:27,023
leaving a dead man on the floor.

810
00:47:29,594 --> 00:47:31,288
This is absolute nonsense.

811
00:47:34,125 --> 00:47:36,430
Why should I want to kill him?

812
00:47:36,737 --> 00:47:39,205
In the Astoprene file,

813
00:47:39,463 --> 00:47:43,460
I noticed a contract that bears
your signature.

814
00:47:49,025 --> 00:47:50,794
It would appear
that you were instrumental

815
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:52,218
in the development
of the invention

816
00:47:52,481 --> 00:47:55,026
by Monsieur Naylor.

817
00:47:55,284 --> 00:47:57,710
You were to become
a very rich man,

818
00:47:58,011 --> 00:48:00,512
if it was produced
by the Astwell Company.

819
00:48:00,814 --> 00:48:03,622
But if the process
was to be licensed elsewhere,

820
00:48:03,886 --> 00:48:07,655
as it was told to you
by your German colleagues,

821
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:11,567
of what value then would be
your contract?

822
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:19,066
Of no value at all.

823
00:48:24,789 --> 00:48:32,523
He was a bully, a liar,
and a swindler.

824
00:48:32,788 --> 00:48:35,064
I think there will be
few people who would disagree

825
00:48:35,365 --> 00:48:38,254
with your analysis
of the character of Sir Rueben.

826
00:48:45,403 --> 00:48:47,220
So tell me, Mademoiselle Naylor,

827
00:48:47,481 --> 00:48:49,372
your brother, he is happy
with the terms offered

828
00:48:49,634 --> 00:48:50,914
by Monsieur Victor Astwell?

829
00:48:51,173 --> 00:48:52,945
Well, they really are
quite generous.

830
00:48:53,211 --> 00:48:54,753
Shhshh-shh.

831
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:03,909
Captain Hastings?

832
00:49:04,211 --> 00:49:06,596
A hole in one, Captain Hastings.

833
00:49:06,865 --> 00:49:08,298
A hole in one.

834
00:49:08,558 --> 00:49:10,024
Miss Lemon, Captain Hastings

835
00:49:10,288 --> 00:49:12,290
possesses far too much
of the intellectual strength-

836
00:49:12,557 --> 00:49:14,559
Quite right, Poirot.
