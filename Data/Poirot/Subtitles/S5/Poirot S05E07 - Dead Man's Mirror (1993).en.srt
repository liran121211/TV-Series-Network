Well, that was a bit

Yes, indeed, Hastings.

This Gervase Chevenix,

Oh, I take it you'll refuse.

72

To refuse, yes,
it is my first instinct.

as this...

Even he may be vulnerable
in ways he cannot see.

76
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,994
And he did offer you
that mirror.

00:04:04,292 --> 00:04:05,406

Oh, I won't, thank you.

My fianc・ Hugo,

Actually, he's not my fianc・

Oh, Hugo Trent,

00:05:51,881 --> 00:05:52,732
Gervase's nephew.

112
00:05:52,994 --> 00:05:53,923
He's meeting you at the station,

113
00:05:54,186 --> 00:05:56,566
so he suggested
I come on the same train.

114
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:58,680
Are you staying
with Monsieur Chevenix?

115
00:05:58,946 --> 00:06:01,218
Unfortunately, yes.

116
00:06:01,518 --> 00:06:02,600
Well, I've only met him once,

117
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:06,325
and he was
absolutely horrible to me.

118
00:06:06,587 --> 00:06:08,281
He doesn't approve of you?

119
00:06:08,545 --> 00:06:10,358
It's not that.
It's just--

120
00:06:10,619 --> 00:06:13,241
Well, it's--
it's Hugo and me.

121
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,038
You see, Gervase
has always had his heart set

00:06:15,303 --> 00:06:16,920
on Hugo marrying
his daughter, Ruth.

123
00:06:17,186 --> 00:06:19,260
But he's not inclined
to do that.

124
00:06:19,566 --> 00:06:20,953
No.

125
00:06:21,217 --> 00:06:22,724
But you see,
Ruth was adopted.

126
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:25,330
I suppose Gervase thinks
marrying her to his nephew

127
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:29,558
will-will make her
more completely his.

128
00:06:29,818 --> 00:06:31,631
But he can't force them
to marry, can he?

129
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,126
He can try.

130
00:06:33,388 --> 00:06:34,928
He will try.

131
00:06:35,193 --> 00:06:36,427
I think he enjoys it--

- Not at all.
- It's on the way.

153
00:07:30,793 --> 00:07:33,370
I think
it is most remarkable.

154
00:07:33,672 --> 00:07:34,907
Is it all metal?

00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,208
Tubular steel.

156
00:07:36,514 --> 00:07:38,665
You see, who needs wood,
Captain Hastings?

157
00:07:38,933 --> 00:07:41,237
Wood expands. It perishes.
It dries out.

158
00:07:41,506 --> 00:07:44,050
But metal, metal is perfect.

159
00:07:44,308 --> 00:07:46,536
You see, triangulated joinery.

160
00:07:46,804 --> 00:07:47,656
There's no fuss.

161
00:07:47,956 --> 00:07:49,146
Oh, yes, I see.

00:07:49,415 --> 00:07:51,337

- Give me a minute, Lawrence.

Sit down.

00:08:07,692 --> 00:08:08,620
What do you think?

166
00:08:08,883 --> 00:08:11,581
I think...

167
00:08:11,877 --> 00:08:14,608
that it is perfectly conceived.

168
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:16,801

Mr. Poirot.

He does not support
this enterprise?

172
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,904
Just getting this far
has been a struggle.

173
00:08:26,161 --> 00:08:27,439
Now the banks are closing in,

174
00:08:27,697 --> 00:08:29,052

my designs

Mm.
Quite a place.

186
00:09:13,198 --> 00:09:14,203
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

187
00:09:14,504 --> 00:09:15,782
Mr. Chevenix
is waiting for you.

188
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,154
<i>Merci.</i>

189
00:09:17,422 --> 00:09:18,809
Enter!

190
00:09:21,838 --> 00:09:23,115
Monsieur Poirot, sir.

191
00:09:23,373 --> 00:09:24,990
Oh, Mr. Poirot.

192
00:09:25,255 --> 00:09:26,992
Good of you to come.

193
00:09:27,253 --> 00:09:29,829
You've brought your secretary.

194
00:09:30,094 --> 00:09:33,206
This is my associate,
Captain Hastings.

195
00:09:33,511 --> 00:09:34,286
Oh, yes.

196
00:09:34,585 --> 00:09:36,125
I saw him at the auction.

197
00:09:36,429 --> 00:09:37,738
Well, what do you think?

198
00:09:38,003 --> 00:09:38,855
Hung it this morning.

199
00:09:39,117 --> 00:09:40,852
Looks good, doesn't it?

200
00:09:41,151 --> 00:09:42,811
Yes, indeed.

201
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,229
Shall I come back later,
Mr. Chevenix?

202
00:09:45,491 --> 00:09:46,342
Yes.

203
00:09:46,603 --> 00:09:48,984
You can sort out
that stuff on Matisse.

204
00:09:49,253 --> 00:09:52,180
This is Miss Lingard,
my research assistant.

205
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,446
How do you do?

206
00:09:53,746 --> 00:09:54,631
Mademoiselle Lingard.

207
00:09:54,898 --> 00:09:57,016
We're working
on a study of fauvism

208
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,857
for the British Museum
of Modern Art.

209
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,779
Oh, Miss Lingard,

210
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,191
is that architect here?

211
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:06,272
I believe so,
Mr. Chevenix.

212
00:10:06,532 --> 00:10:08,576
Have him come in,
will you?

213
00:10:10,448 --> 00:10:12,916
｣10,000, Mr. Poirot--

214
00:10:13,175 --> 00:10:14,835
not a drop in the ocean.

215
00:10:15,094 --> 00:10:17,869
That's how much I've paid him,
John Lake.

216
00:10:18,129 --> 00:10:20,204
And this is the fraud
you wish me to investigate?

217
00:10:20,509 --> 00:10:21,819
Yes.

218
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,852
For what purpose
did you give him the money?

219
00:10:24,118 --> 00:10:25,965
A big development
in London:

220
00:10:26,268 --> 00:10:28,311
shops, offices, apartments.

221
00:10:28,572 --> 00:10:31,347
He's building it,
and he's gotten me to invest.

222
00:10:31,606 --> 00:10:33,833
So far, he hasn't even
laid a brick.

223
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:35,679
And I'm beginning to wonder
if he ever will.

224
00:10:35,983 --> 00:10:36,988
[knock at door]

225
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,755
You wanted to see me,
Gervase?

226
00:10:41,013 --> 00:10:42,247
Come in, Lake.

227
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,324
There's someone
I want you to meet.

228
00:10:44,622 --> 00:10:47,735
This is Hercule Poirot.

229
00:10:48,001 --> 00:10:49,432
The detective.

230
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,886
Yes.

231
00:10:52,187 --> 00:10:54,108
Why don't you take Mr. Poirot
into the garden

232
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:55,959
and get him some tea?

233
00:10:56,257 --> 00:10:57,217
I'll see you at dinner.

234
00:10:57,485 --> 00:10:58,916
We'll eat in the hall,
quarter past 8:00.

235
00:10:59,175 --> 00:11:00,912
Do try not to be late.

236
00:11:01,171 --> 00:11:04,023
Snell rings the first gong
at eight minutes past the hour

237
00:11:04,282 --> 00:11:05,712
and the second at 8:15.

238
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,708
I'll see you then.

239
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:09,738
Gentlemen.

240
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:21,218
I-- I don't suppose--

241
00:11:21,484 --> 00:11:23,559
You're not here on business,
Mr. Poirot.

242
00:11:23,864 --> 00:11:25,862
That is precisely
why I am here, Monsieur Lake.

243
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:27,211
Oh.

244
00:11:27,474 --> 00:11:28,752
That's typical of Gervase.

245
00:11:29,009 --> 00:11:31,969
He likes to spring
his surprises.

Let me introduce you.

249
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,806
This is Mrs. Vanda Chevenix.

250
00:11:41,066 --> 00:11:42,573
Hercule Poirot,
Captain Hastings.

251
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,723
- Madame.
- How do you do?

252
00:11:45,021 --> 00:11:47,490
And her daughter,
Miss Chevenix.

253
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,484
Ruth.

254
00:11:49,782 --> 00:11:51,213
- <i>Mademoiselle.</i>
- Hello.

255
00:11:51,472 --> 00:11:53,395
Hello.

256
00:11:53,699 --> 00:11:56,812
Apparently, Mr. Poirot is
doing some work for your father.

257
00:11:57,078 --> 00:11:58,083
For Gervase?

258
00:11:58,345 --> 00:11:59,197
Really?

259
00:11:59,497 --> 00:12:00,426
<i>Oui.</i>

260
00:12:00,688 --> 00:12:02,424
It is about the death.

261
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,995
What death,
Madame Chevenix?

262
00:12:06,294 --> 00:12:09,865
Safra warned me
there would be a death.

263
00:12:10,172 --> 00:12:12,093
She told me
not to be afraid.

264
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,436
Who's Safra?

265
00:12:14,741 --> 00:12:17,930
She was a servant
of Amenhotep.

266
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:20,195
She is my spiritual guide.

267
00:12:20,501 --> 00:12:21,931
Oh, come on, Vanda.

268
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:24,691
I'm sure Mr. Poirot doesn't want
to hear about all that.

269
00:12:24,954 --> 00:12:26,768
<i>Au contraire, mademoiselle.</i>

270
00:12:27,028 --> 00:12:30,676
Poirot interests himself always
in matters of the occult.

271
00:12:32,864 --> 00:12:35,137
You permit?

272
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:36,708
<i>Merci.</i>

273
00:12:47,071 --> 00:12:48,426
It is very old.

274
00:12:48,683 --> 00:12:52,801
It is 3,000 years old.

275
00:12:53,062 --> 00:12:54,022
It was hers.

276
00:12:54,328 --> 00:12:57,561
This belonged to Safra?

277
00:12:57,823 --> 00:13:00,203
She is never wrong.

278
00:13:00,471 --> 00:13:01,587
I...

279
00:13:01,893 --> 00:13:03,586
I think I'd better be going.

280
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:05,473
I'll walk round with you.

281
00:13:05,771 --> 00:13:06,809
Excuse me.

282
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,082
Right.

283
00:13:09,611 --> 00:13:10,998

Where are you going, Ruth?

290
00:13:32,726 --> 00:13:33,732
I dropped my brooch somewhere.

Outside, I think.

Oh.

Non.

No, it was a car.

I'd say it was obvious.

What is it?

360
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:01,002
It is a small fragment

all over the place.

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:05,685
We did.

364
00:19:05,951 --> 00:19:07,536
We heard a shot

365
00:19:07,796 --> 00:19:09,532
and then we broke in the door.

He locked himself in.

370
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,348
That more or less wraps it up.

371
00:19:31,647 --> 00:19:33,308
You believe so?

372
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:35,573
Well, we've got a dead man.

373
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:37,528
You heard a shot,
he's alone in the room,

374
00:19:37,793 --> 00:19:39,487
the gun's in his hand,
and the door was locked.

375
00:19:39,752 --> 00:19:41,182
Well, what about the windows?

376
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:49,202
Fastened.

377
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:51,360
And this one.

378
00:19:56,576 --> 00:19:57,963
This one too.

379
00:19:58,226 --> 00:19:59,187
Right.

380
00:19:59,495 --> 00:20:00,423
Well, I'd better go
and have a word

381
00:20:00,685 --> 00:20:01,963
with Mrs. Chevenix,

382
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,489
not that there's much to say.

383
00:20:07,829 --> 00:20:08,715
[sighs]

384
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,676
You know, it does look
like suicide, Poirot.

385
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:14,359
<i>Oui, c'est possible,
mon ami.</i>

386
00:20:14,628 --> 00:20:16,550
And yet...

387
00:20:16,855 --> 00:20:19,052
there are many things
I wish to know.

388
00:20:27,995 --> 00:20:30,038
For example,

389
00:20:30,337 --> 00:20:31,769
why was the mirror broken?

390
00:20:32,067 --> 00:20:33,453
And why was there mud
on the shoes

391
00:20:33,717 --> 00:20:35,914
belonging
to Mademoiselle Ruth Chevenix?

392
00:20:37,328 --> 00:20:38,988
<i>Voil・</i>

393
00:20:39,248 --> 00:20:40,440
Footprints.

394
00:20:40,747 --> 00:20:42,440
Yes, Hastings, they are
the footprints of a lady

395
00:20:42,744 --> 00:20:44,787
and directly outside the study
of Monsieur Chevenix.

396
00:20:45,049 --> 00:20:47,277
But the French window
was locked from the inside.

397
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:48,468
But this window, Hastings,

398
00:20:48,735 --> 00:20:49,971
it can be locked
from the outside.

399
00:20:50,273 --> 00:20:51,278
<i>Regarde.</i>

400
00:20:53,767 --> 00:20:57,733
By raising the metal catch so

401
00:20:58,031 --> 00:20:59,725
and then, with a push...

402
00:21:02,601 --> 00:21:03,793
[metallic thunk]

403
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:06,913
Good Lord.

404
00:21:07,173 --> 00:21:08,986
[sniffing]

405
00:21:09,246 --> 00:21:11,519
You know, Chief Inspector,

406
00:21:11,782 --> 00:21:15,705
life is one
of the great illusions.

407
00:21:17,082 --> 00:21:20,164
I'm afraid I don't quite agree
with that, Mrs. Chevenix.

408
00:21:20,423 --> 00:21:23,079
Gervase knew that.

409
00:21:23,343 --> 00:21:25,190
He and I, you see,

410
00:21:25,456 --> 00:21:28,307
we met on the same plane.

411
00:21:28,567 --> 00:21:30,413
On holiday?

412
00:21:30,718 --> 00:21:33,832
The spiritual plane.

413
00:21:34,098 --> 00:21:36,950
He was one of the great ones.

414
00:21:37,209 --> 00:21:39,405
He, too, found it hard
to conform

415
00:21:39,667 --> 00:21:42,705
to the silly standards
of the everyday world.

416
00:21:45,621 --> 00:21:48,505
And he believed me

417
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,693
about the death.

418
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:54,264
You'd been told
about his death?

419
00:21:55,454 --> 00:21:57,147
Oh, yes.

420
00:21:58,986 --> 00:22:01,106
Safra told me.

421
00:22:01,407 --> 00:22:03,176
She knew.

422
00:22:03,481 --> 00:22:06,060
Did she, indeed?

423
00:22:06,361 --> 00:22:08,252
Mrs. Chevenix,
can you tell me

424
00:22:08,513 --> 00:22:11,168
where I might be able
to get hold of this Safra?

425
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,087
She used to live in Egypt.

426
00:22:16,348 --> 00:22:18,774
But she moved?

427
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:20,227
No.

428
00:22:20,535 --> 00:22:21,649
Perfectly conceived.

429
00:22:21,918 --> 00:22:23,109
[laughs]

430
00:22:23,415 --> 00:22:24,421
Oh, hello, Mr. Poirot.

431
00:22:24,683 --> 00:22:26,071
Oh, Mr. Poirot.

432
00:22:28,063 --> 00:22:29,254
Monsieur Trent...

433
00:22:31,635 --> 00:22:34,519
Did you see your uncle
earlier this evening?

434
00:22:34,785 --> 00:22:36,140
Yes.

435
00:22:36,398 --> 00:22:38,213
It must have been about 7:00.

436
00:22:38,472 --> 00:22:40,012
He was dressed for dinner.

437
00:22:40,277 --> 00:22:41,393
I-- I went to see him

438
00:22:41,698 --> 00:22:43,053
to ask him to help me
with my business.

439
00:22:43,311 --> 00:22:45,540
But he wouldn't listen.

440
00:22:45,809 --> 00:22:47,698
He wanted Hugo
to marry Ruth.

441
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,003
No marriage to Ruth,
no money for me.

442
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:51,996
That's what it boiled down to.

443
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,764
So, Monsieur Trent,

444
00:22:54,028 --> 00:22:57,524
you had no reason, therefore,
to celebrate.

445
00:22:57,791 --> 00:22:58,721
None at all.

446
00:22:59,021 --> 00:22:59,829
It was not you, then,

447
00:23:00,135 --> 00:23:01,491
that opened this bottle
of champagne?

448
00:23:01,749 --> 00:23:03,212
No.

449
00:23:03,476 --> 00:23:04,592
Curious.

450
00:23:04,898 --> 00:23:06,405
The bottle of champagne,
it is opened,

451
00:23:06,703 --> 00:23:08,746
and yet the contents
are not consumed.

452
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:18,690
Ah, there you are, Poirot.

453
00:23:18,957 --> 00:23:21,151
You got any idea where I can
get hold of this Safra,

454
00:23:21,413 --> 00:23:22,999
some sort of friend
of Mrs. Chevenix?

455
00:23:23,257 --> 00:23:25,148
Safra's dead.

456
00:23:25,408 --> 00:23:27,605
She's Vanda's spirit guide.

457
00:23:29,211 --> 00:23:30,828
Ah.

458
00:23:31,093 --> 00:23:32,284
I might as well be off, then.

459
00:23:32,591 --> 00:23:34,788
You believe there is nothing
to investigate?

460
00:23:35,049 --> 00:23:37,017
Gervase Chevenix
shot himself.

461
00:23:37,277 --> 00:23:38,664
I'm sure of it.

462
00:23:38,929 --> 00:23:40,851
In that event,
Chief Inspector, d'accord.

463
00:23:41,118 --> 00:23:43,162
We will return at once
to London.

464
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:45,804
There are, perhaps,
two questions

465
00:23:46,112 --> 00:23:49,039
that you might be able
to answer for me.

466
00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:51,496
Oh, yes.

467
00:23:54,639 --> 00:23:56,375
First question:

468
00:23:56,675 --> 00:23:59,788
was Monsieur Chevenix
right-handed or left-handed?

469
00:24:01,629 --> 00:24:03,519
What's the other question?

470
00:24:03,781 --> 00:24:05,134
It is more simple.

471
00:24:05,432 --> 00:24:10,042
If Monsieur Chevenix
shot himself,

472
00:24:10,309 --> 00:24:13,958
what has happened
to the bullet?

473
00:24:17,339 --> 00:24:20,344
[children yelling]

474
00:24:26,903 --> 00:24:28,825
[buzzer buzzes]

475
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:31,867
[footsteps approaching]

476
00:24:32,165 --> 00:24:33,400
Oh, hello, Miss Chevenix.

477
00:24:33,663 --> 00:24:34,669
Could I see Mr. Poirot,
please?

478
00:24:34,969 --> 00:24:37,471
Yes.
Follow me down this way.

479
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:39,541
Miss Chevenix is here.

480
00:24:39,847 --> 00:24:40,656
<i>Ah, mademoiselle.</i>

481
00:24:40,961 --> 00:24:42,774
Mr. Poirot,
I need to see you.

482
00:24:43,035 --> 00:24:45,034
Please to sit down,
mademoiselle.

483
00:24:47,183 --> 00:24:48,538
Is it true
that Gervase hired you

484
00:24:48,795 --> 00:24:51,069
to investigate John Lake?

485
00:24:52,522 --> 00:24:53,757
<i>Oui, mademoiselle.</i>

486
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,484
Monsieur Chevenix believed

487
00:24:55,749 --> 00:24:57,213
that he was the object
of a fraud.

488
00:24:57,476 --> 00:24:59,705
Well, I've come to tell you
that the case is over.

489
00:25:00,012 --> 00:25:02,088
I don't know
what he offered to pay you,

490
00:25:02,355 --> 00:25:04,399
but I hope
that will cover it.

491
00:25:06,657 --> 00:25:08,197
[purse snaps shut]

492
00:25:08,462 --> 00:25:09,772
<i>Mademoiselle,</i>

493
00:25:10,038 --> 00:25:15,651
the company
of Monsieur John Lake,

494
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:17,421
what is it called?

495
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,527
It's Northgate Development.

496
00:25:19,792 --> 00:25:22,491
But I'm telling you, Mr. Poirot,
there is nothing to investigate.

497
00:25:22,751 --> 00:25:25,099
May I ask, mademoiselle...

498
00:25:27,167 --> 00:25:29,134
Were you close
to your guardian?

499
00:25:29,395 --> 00:25:30,553
[exhales sharply]

500
00:25:31,892 --> 00:25:34,973
I was grateful to Gervase.

501
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:37,659
And he wasn't just my guardian.

502
00:25:37,922 --> 00:25:39,463
He was actually my uncle.

503
00:25:39,728 --> 00:25:41,617
But he adopted you.

504
00:25:41,878 --> 00:25:46,488
I was what is quaintly called
a love child.

505
00:25:46,756 --> 00:25:48,341
My father
was Gervase's younger brother.

506
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,758
He was killed in the war.

507
00:25:50,059 --> 00:25:52,562
And my mother was a typist.

508
00:25:52,863 --> 00:25:54,174
Ah.

509
00:25:54,439 --> 00:25:56,022
And where is she now?

510
00:25:56,281 --> 00:25:57,473
I don't know.

511
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:00,555
When my father died,
she wrote to Gervase.

512
00:26:00,814 --> 00:26:02,169
He couldn't have
any children of his own,

513
00:26:02,465 --> 00:26:03,472
so he adopted me.

514
00:26:03,473 --> 00:26:04,350
I see.

515
00:26:04,616 --> 00:26:06,922
Please to sit down,
mademoiselle.

516
00:26:12,491 --> 00:26:15,222
Tell me, <i>mademoiselle,</i>

517
00:26:15,487 --> 00:26:21,332
on the night of the death
of Monsieur Chevenix,

518
00:26:21,633 --> 00:26:23,250
where were you at 8:00?

519
00:26:23,553 --> 00:26:25,552
I was in the house.

520
00:26:25,819 --> 00:26:27,174
- But you went out, I think.
- Did I?

521
00:26:27,471 --> 00:26:28,705
Oh, yes, there was mud
on your shoes.

522
00:26:28,969 --> 00:26:30,662
I remarked on the fact.

523
00:26:30,927 --> 00:26:32,850
You don't miss a thing,
do you?

524
00:26:33,156 --> 00:26:34,193
Well, yes.

525
00:26:34,461 --> 00:26:36,001
I went out twice.

526
00:26:36,267 --> 00:26:39,194
At about 6:00, I went to pick
some daisies just by the study.

527
00:26:39,454 --> 00:26:40,690
And later?

528
00:26:40,991 --> 00:26:43,066
[exhales sharply]

529
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:46,293
It must have been
just after 8:00,

530
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:47,713
I realized
I'd dropped my brooch,

531
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,139
and I went back to get it.

532
00:26:49,442 --> 00:26:51,135
It is as simple as that.

533
00:26:51,438 --> 00:26:54,290
If you don't believe me,
you can ask Miss Lingard.

534
00:26:54,549 --> 00:26:55,741
Mademoiselle Lingard?

535
00:26:56,009 --> 00:26:58,282
She was in the lounge
when I came in.

536
00:26:58,544 --> 00:27:00,160
[camera shutter clicks]

537
00:27:10,835 --> 00:27:11,721
[camera shutter clicks]

538
00:27:11,987 --> 00:27:12,917
[gasps]

539
00:27:13,178 --> 00:27:14,029
Mr. Poirot.

540
00:27:14,292 --> 00:27:15,253
Mademoiselle Lingard.

541
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:16,991
- Captain Hastings.
- Miss Lingard.

542
00:27:17,287 --> 00:27:18,753
Ah, you quite startled me.

543
00:27:19,017 --> 00:27:20,633
Still working on the book,
I see.

544
00:27:20,898 --> 00:27:22,134
Well, yes.

545
00:27:22,397 --> 00:27:23,751
I was paid
until the end of the month,

546
00:27:24,048 --> 00:27:25,589
and the book's
so nearly finished,

547
00:27:25,891 --> 00:27:27,399
it's a shame to stop now.

548
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:30,696
But this is not, I believe,
a fauve painting.

549
00:27:30,962 --> 00:27:33,387
No, it's later.

550
00:27:33,689 --> 00:27:37,033
But it's
such a beautiful painting,

551
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,806
so sad.

552
00:27:39,066 --> 00:27:40,497
Yes, indeed.

553
00:27:40,756 --> 00:27:42,264
Mademoiselle Lingard,

554
00:27:42,524 --> 00:27:44,292
I wonder if I might
ask you some questions

555
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:47,105
concerning the death
of Monsieur Gervase Chevenix.

556
00:27:47,362 --> 00:27:48,794
On the night of his death,

557
00:27:49,092 --> 00:27:50,981
as the study door
was being broken open,

558
00:27:51,243 --> 00:27:53,787
I noticed that you bent down
to retrieve something.

559
00:27:54,046 --> 00:27:55,783
Oh, yes.

560
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:59,163
It was this.

561
00:27:59,423 --> 00:28:00,809
Oh, looks like a bullet.

562
00:28:01,073 --> 00:28:02,306
That's what I thought.

563
00:28:02,608 --> 00:28:05,990
But in fact,
it's a cuff link.

564
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:08,637
I believe it belongs
to Mr. Trent.

565
00:28:08,899 --> 00:28:10,633
I was meaning
to give it back to him.

566
00:28:10,893 --> 00:28:12,661
I wonder what it was doing
outside the study.

567
00:28:12,965 --> 00:28:13,815
I've no idea.

568
00:28:14,115 --> 00:28:15,305
If you permit,
I shall return it to him

569
00:28:15,573 --> 00:28:16,457
on your behalf.

570
00:28:16,762 --> 00:28:18,606
Oh, thank you.

571
00:28:18,911 --> 00:28:21,758
One final question,
Mademoiselle Lingard.

572
00:28:22,018 --> 00:28:24,745
Ruth Chevenix.

573
00:28:25,009 --> 00:28:26,363
What about her?

574
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:27,810
I understand
that you saw her

575
00:28:28,078 --> 00:28:29,694
just before the body
was discovered.

576
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:30,962
Yes.

577
00:28:31,262 --> 00:28:33,957
It was just after we all
heard the shot.

578
00:28:34,255 --> 00:28:35,990
She was with me
in the living room.

579
00:28:36,249 --> 00:28:38,017
Ah.

580
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:41,131
It is as I thought.

581
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:43,386
<i>Merci.</i>

582
00:28:43,692 --> 00:28:46,845
Well, that seems
to back up Ruth's story.

583
00:28:47,106 --> 00:28:48,611
Tell me, Hastings,
what was your opinion

584
00:28:48,869 --> 00:28:49,830
of Mademoiselle Ruth?

585
00:28:50,098 --> 00:28:51,407
Well, I don't know.

586
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:54,670
I'd like to know why she seemed
so keen to defend John Lake.

587
00:28:54,931 --> 00:28:56,164
<i>Pr馗is駑ent.</i>

588
00:28:56,428 --> 00:28:58,315
And that is also the question
that exercises

589
00:28:58,576 --> 00:29:00,615
the little gray cells
of Poirot.

590
00:29:05,404 --> 00:29:07,019
All right, Poirot, you win.

591
00:29:07,283 --> 00:29:08,745
It wasn't suicide.

592
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:11,552
From what comes this
change of mind, Chief Inspector?

593
00:29:11,809 --> 00:29:12,890
Well, it's like you said.

594
00:29:13,152 --> 00:29:15,039
Gervase Chevenix
was right-handed.

595
00:29:15,339 --> 00:29:17,641
But when we found him,
the gun was in his left hand.

596
00:29:17,909 --> 00:29:18,794
<i>Oui.</i>

597
00:29:19,098 --> 00:29:20,102
And as for the bullet,

598
00:29:20,364 --> 00:29:22,787
it's vanished into thin air.

599
00:29:23,087 --> 00:29:24,626
Isn't it in the wall?

600
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,238
Nowhere.

601
00:29:27,845 --> 00:29:29,917
And here's something

602
00:29:30,184 --> 00:29:31,767
that you ought to see...

603
00:29:33,676 --> 00:29:36,861
The last will and testament
of Gervase Chevenix,

604
00:29:37,128 --> 00:29:39,671
leaving his fortune--
and it's a tidy sum--

605
00:29:39,928 --> 00:29:42,394
to Vanda and Ruth Chevenix.

606
00:29:42,652 --> 00:29:44,648
They split it 50/50.

607
00:29:44,914 --> 00:29:47,916
Oh, and there's a bequest
of ｣2,000

608
00:29:48,176 --> 00:29:50,401
to Hugo Trent.

609
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,549
Ah.

610
00:29:52,855 --> 00:29:54,591
So he received his capital
after all.

611
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:55,854
Ah, yes.

612
00:29:56,116 --> 00:29:58,690
But there's something else.

613
00:29:58,955 --> 00:30:02,032
We found this
in one of his desk drawers,

614
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:03,608
unlocked.

615
00:30:03,865 --> 00:30:05,600
Anyone could have seen it.

616
00:30:12,189 --> 00:30:13,466
A second will.

617
00:30:13,762 --> 00:30:14,613
Yes,

618
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:17,029
but unsigned.

619
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:23,776
What does it entail?

620
00:30:24,043 --> 00:30:26,236
It's completely barmy.

621
00:30:26,498 --> 00:30:28,035
Vanda Chevenix gets everything

622
00:30:28,339 --> 00:30:31,142
if Hugo Trent and Ruth Chevenix
don't marry each other.

623
00:30:31,408 --> 00:30:33,099
I say.

624
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:34,520
That sounds like
a motive for murder

625
00:30:34,784 --> 00:30:35,592
if ever I heard one.

626
00:30:35,896 --> 00:30:36,892
Right.

627
00:30:36,893 --> 00:30:39,271
That's what I thought too.

628
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,308
So you are suggesting
that Monsieur Chevenix

629
00:30:41,612 --> 00:30:43,882
was killed to prevent him
from signing this new will?

630
00:30:44,144 --> 00:30:45,911
Right.

631
00:30:48,784 --> 00:30:50,324
It is possible, yes.

632
00:30:50,588 --> 00:30:52,629
But there's one thing
I'd like to know, Poirot.

633
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:54,472
What is that,
Chief Inspector?

634
00:30:54,731 --> 00:30:56,804
What exactly were you doing
at Hamborough Close?

635
00:30:57,109 --> 00:30:59,488
How did you get mixed up
in all this?

636
00:31:00,561 --> 00:31:01,642
Fraud?

637
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:04,594
That is what Monsieur Chevenix
believed.

638
00:31:14,717 --> 00:31:16,485
Northgate Development.

639
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,484
Not quite what you'd expect,
is it?

640
00:31:18,745 --> 00:31:20,893
Well, if this place is just
a front, Captain Hastings,

641
00:31:21,161 --> 00:31:23,311
it's exactly what I'd expect.

642
00:31:26,148 --> 00:31:28,189
Yeah, the door's open.

643
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:37,282
It's very quiet.

644
00:31:38,999 --> 00:31:40,614
There doesn't seem
to be anybody about.

645
00:31:40,879 --> 00:31:42,341
Place is deserted.

646
00:31:42,605 --> 00:31:44,449
Must've done a buck.

647
00:31:46,211 --> 00:31:47,903
I say, Poirot.

648
00:31:48,168 --> 00:31:49,401
Come and look at this.

649
00:31:53,116 --> 00:31:55,691
Pond Street, Harrow.

650
00:31:55,954 --> 00:31:57,340
It's a scale model
of the development.

651
00:31:57,604 --> 00:32:00,332
Does it not remind you
of something, Hastings?

652
00:32:00,596 --> 00:32:02,637
Looks a bit like
Hamborough Close.

653
00:32:02,898 --> 00:32:05,200
It is the work
of the same hand.

654
00:32:08,268 --> 00:32:11,422
Hastings, do you smell smoke?

655
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:12,452
[sniffs]

656
00:32:12,756 --> 00:32:14,219
Yes.

657
00:32:24,264 --> 00:32:25,802
[moaning]

658
00:32:26,106 --> 00:32:27,142
God, there's someone in there.

659
00:32:27,409 --> 00:32:28,686
Japp!

660
00:32:28,983 --> 00:32:30,292
What is it?

661
00:32:33,049 --> 00:32:34,861
Blimey.

662
00:32:38,841 --> 00:32:40,304
It's John Lake.

663
00:32:40,606 --> 00:32:43,071
Come on, get him outside.

664
00:32:44,059 --> 00:32:45,062
<i>Oh, sacre bleu.</i>

665
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:47,359
The fire, it is spreading!

666
00:32:47,626 --> 00:32:48,629
[coughing]

667
00:32:48,892 --> 00:32:49,929
Chief Inspector,

668
00:32:50,235 --> 00:32:52,199
Hastings, follow me!

669
00:32:54,301 --> 00:32:55,764
[coughing]

670
00:32:56,066 --> 00:32:57,756
Careful, Captain Hastings.

671
00:32:58,022 --> 00:32:59,484
Ugh, I can't see.

672
00:32:59,787 --> 00:33:02,438
[all coughing]

673
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:05,512
[dramatic music]

674
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:13,103
<i>[music]</i>

675
00:33:13,367 --> 00:33:16,247
[explosion]

676
00:33:19,465 --> 00:33:21,047
Good Lord.

677
00:33:32,354 --> 00:33:34,897
Mr. Poirot.

678
00:33:35,193 --> 00:33:36,622
I'm sorry.

679
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:38,266
I've been foolish.

680
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:40,527
You wish to tell me
about Northgate Development,

681
00:33:40,794 --> 00:33:41,678
Monsieur Lake?

682
00:33:41,983 --> 00:33:43,369
Yes.

683
00:33:44,744 --> 00:33:46,251
[sighs]
Yes.

684
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:50,002
I didn't know what I was doing.

685
00:33:50,269 --> 00:33:51,927
That's the truth of it.

686
00:33:52,186 --> 00:33:54,074
I was out of my depth.

687
00:33:56,176 --> 00:33:59,669
To start with,
I was just the architect.

688
00:33:59,936 --> 00:34:03,275
Then they asked me
if I'd like to be a partner.

689
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:04,817
I didn't know anything
about business,

690
00:34:05,114 --> 00:34:07,579
but I was flattered.

691
00:34:07,876 --> 00:34:09,993
And so you helped them
to raise the finance?

692
00:34:10,254 --> 00:34:11,138
Yes.

693
00:34:11,406 --> 00:34:13,980
And they disappeared with it,
leaving you to carry the can.

694
00:34:14,244 --> 00:34:15,936
That's right.

695
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,735
When Gervase called you in,
I was afraid.

696
00:34:19,999 --> 00:34:22,147
I panicked.

697
00:34:22,414 --> 00:34:24,532
I just wanted
to get rid of the evidence.

698
00:34:24,793 --> 00:34:28,437
So it was you
that started the blaze.

699
00:34:28,705 --> 00:34:30,702
I set a device,

700
00:34:31,007 --> 00:34:32,284
a timer.

701
00:34:32,542 --> 00:34:35,695
Which misfired.

702
00:34:39,332 --> 00:34:40,947
If you--

703
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:43,515
if you hadn't found me...

704
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:54,030
Mr. Poirot.

705
00:34:54,293 --> 00:34:55,177
<i>Mademoiselle.</i>

706
00:34:55,444 --> 00:34:56,600
Chief Inspector.

707
00:34:56,901 --> 00:34:59,443
I have to go in.

708
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,125
I'm sorry, miss,
no visitors.

709
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,201
But you don't understand.
I must see him.

710
00:35:03,498 --> 00:35:04,503
It's family only.

711
00:35:04,504 --> 00:35:06,493
Those are doctor's orders.

712
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:10,023
I am family, Chief Inspector.

713
00:35:10,327 --> 00:35:12,061
I'm his wife.

714
00:35:13,856 --> 00:35:16,661
John and I were married
a week ago.

715
00:35:18,652 --> 00:35:20,463
Can I go in?

716
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:24,678
Your husband awaits you.

717
00:35:30,582 --> 00:35:32,425
Well, well, well.

718
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:36,607
So Ruth
secretly married John.

719
00:35:36,873 --> 00:35:38,914
Well, good luck to her
is all I can say.

720
00:35:39,175 --> 00:35:40,527
But you also have plans
for the marriage,

721
00:35:40,823 --> 00:35:41,674
Mademoiselle Susan.

722
00:35:41,975 --> 00:35:43,088
Yes, and from now on,

723
00:35:43,356 --> 00:35:44,971
I'll be helping Hugo
with his business.

724
00:35:45,236 --> 00:35:47,003
But what brings you here,
Mr. Poirot?

725
00:35:47,268 --> 00:35:48,153
Do you want to place an order?

726
00:35:48,457 --> 00:35:49,810
<i>Oh, non, non, non.
Non, non, Monsieur Trent.</i>

727
00:35:50,068 --> 00:35:50,920
It is just this.

728
00:35:51,181 --> 00:35:52,916
It belongs, I think, to you?

729
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:56,518
Yes.

730
00:35:56,782 --> 00:35:58,442
Yes, it is mine.

731
00:35:58,703 --> 00:36:00,211
Where did you find it?

732
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:03,049
Monsieur Trent, on the night
that your uncle died,

733
00:36:03,314 --> 00:36:05,357
did you see Monsieur John Lake?

734
00:36:05,619 --> 00:36:06,470
No.

735
00:36:06,771 --> 00:36:08,202
No, he was in the library.

736
00:36:08,462 --> 00:36:09,619
You heard the shot?

737
00:36:09,883 --> 00:36:10,811
Yes.

738
00:36:11,073 --> 00:36:12,188
Susan heard it too.

739
00:36:12,495 --> 00:36:13,501
Yes.

740
00:36:13,762 --> 00:36:15,041
I was dashing down the corridor.

741
00:36:15,338 --> 00:36:17,033
I thought it was
a car backfiring.

742
00:36:17,336 --> 00:36:19,030
But why were you dashing,
Mademoiselle?

743
00:36:19,334 --> 00:36:21,181
Well, I'd got muddled
with the gongs,

744
00:36:21,447 --> 00:36:22,955
and I was terrified
of being late.

745
00:36:23,253 --> 00:36:25,481
You see, I thought I'd
already heard the first gong.

746
00:36:25,749 --> 00:36:27,258
Yes, I thought I heard it too.

747
00:36:27,517 --> 00:36:30,249
Exactly, Hastings.

748
00:36:30,514 --> 00:36:34,896
And yet I, Hercule Poirot,
did not hear.

749
00:36:40,542 --> 00:36:41,929
The case is solved.

750
00:36:42,232 --> 00:36:43,237
Solved? How?

751
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,428
Ah, Hastings.

752
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:46,691
Did you not hear the testimony
of Mademoiselle Cardwell?

753
00:36:46,958 --> 00:36:48,694
And do you not recollect
the bottle of champagne?

754
00:36:48,993 --> 00:36:50,304
It's gonna take
more than champagne

755
00:36:50,569 --> 00:36:51,574
to solve this case, Poirot.

756
00:36:51,874 --> 00:36:53,842
What about the bullet,
for instance?

757
00:36:54,103 --> 00:36:56,300
You shall have the bullet,
Chief Inspector.

758
00:36:56,562 --> 00:37:00,059
Soon you shall have everything.

759
00:37:02,556 --> 00:37:03,636
I have asked you all
to come here

760
00:37:03,901 --> 00:37:05,365
so that you might learn
the true facts

761
00:37:05,629 --> 00:37:08,055
concerning the death
of Monsieur Gervase Chevenix.

762
00:37:08,357 --> 00:37:09,898
He is not dead.

763
00:37:10,202 --> 00:37:11,742
<i>Madame?</i>

764
00:37:12,044 --> 00:37:15,695
He is on a different
spiritual plane, that's all.

765
00:37:16,003 --> 00:37:18,001
There, there.

766
00:37:18,268 --> 00:37:21,767
First, we must accept the fact
that this was not suicide.

767
00:37:22,034 --> 00:37:25,924
Monsieur Chevenix
did not kill himself, non.

768
00:37:26,184 --> 00:37:27,769
He was killed

769
00:37:28,027 --> 00:37:30,956
and by someone
in this very room.

770
00:37:31,255 --> 00:37:32,532
It's not possible!

771
00:37:32,791 --> 00:37:34,944
There was no one in here
when we broke in.

772
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:36,638
And the door was locked
from the inside.

773
00:37:36,902 --> 00:37:38,290
Gervase had the key.

774
00:37:38,554 --> 00:37:39,985
And the windows were fastened.

775
00:37:40,245 --> 00:37:42,168
Anyway, no one would have
wanted to kill him.

776
00:37:42,434 --> 00:37:44,052
Indeed?

777
00:37:44,317 --> 00:37:46,055
And yet it was you,
Mademoiselle Cardwell,

778
00:37:46,315 --> 00:37:48,435
you yourself who told to me
that you hated him

779
00:37:48,735 --> 00:37:50,933
and that you would let nothing
stand in between you

780
00:37:51,194 --> 00:37:52,276
and Monsieur Hugo Trent.

781
00:37:52,578 --> 00:37:53,933
That's not fair.

782
00:37:54,191 --> 00:37:55,502
And you, Monsieur Trent?

783
00:37:55,766 --> 00:37:58,727
You were desperate
to see your business succeed.

784
00:37:58,993 --> 00:38:01,146
It's true.
I-- I needed money.

785
00:38:01,413 --> 00:38:03,960
Money which you now have,
Monsieur,

786
00:38:04,219 --> 00:38:05,803
money which you would
never have received

787
00:38:06,062 --> 00:38:07,603
without the death of your uncle.

788
00:38:14,553 --> 00:38:16,826
You also, Monsieur Lake.

789
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:18,520
Oh, yes.

790
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:22,014
You are afraid from the moment
you set eyes on Poirot.

791
00:38:22,313 --> 00:38:24,391
You have not only
committed arson.

792
00:38:24,658 --> 00:38:26,395
You also persuaded
Monsieur Chevenix

793
00:38:26,655 --> 00:38:29,201
to part with a sum
of ｣10,000.

794
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,044
That wasn't my fault.

795
00:38:31,304 --> 00:38:32,812
<i>Non?</i>

796
00:38:33,072 --> 00:38:36,721
I think Monsieur Chevenix
might have disagreed.

797
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:39,493
And you also.

798
00:38:39,756 --> 00:38:41,909
You had every good reason
to wish your guardian dead,

799
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:43,062
Madame Lake.

800
00:38:43,367 --> 00:38:45,411
I had no reason at all.

801
00:38:45,672 --> 00:38:46,602
And anyway,
even if it was murder,

802
00:38:46,864 --> 00:38:47,673
it couldn't have been me.

803
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:48,715
<i>Non?</i>

804
00:38:49,015 --> 00:38:50,013
I told you, Mr. Poirot.

805
00:38:50,014 --> 00:38:51,369
Miss Ruth
was in the living room with me

806
00:38:51,627 --> 00:38:52,939
when Mr. Chevenix was killed.

807
00:38:53,203 --> 00:38:55,093
At what time was that,
Mademoiselle Lingard?

808
00:38:55,354 --> 00:38:56,895
And at what time
did Mr. Chevenix die?

809
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,548
We know what time he died.

810
00:38:58,851 --> 00:38:59,627
We heard the shot.

811
00:38:59,887 --> 00:39:01,735
<i>Non, non, non.</i>

812
00:39:02,001 --> 00:39:03,891
You were deceived.

813
00:39:04,152 --> 00:39:08,993
At 8:00, Monsieur Chevenix
was indeed in his study

814
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,420
working at his desk.

815
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:14,764
But he was not alone
in the room.

816
00:39:15,063 --> 00:39:16,954
He turned.

817
00:39:17,214 --> 00:39:18,723
[gasps]

818
00:39:19,021 --> 00:39:21,403
The gun was silenced.

819
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:25,864
No one heard the shot.

820
00:39:26,128 --> 00:39:28,325
So...

821
00:39:28,626 --> 00:39:32,166
let us now consider the language
of the bullet.

822
00:39:35,233 --> 00:39:36,742
Hastings, please to sit.

823
00:39:39,767 --> 00:39:41,275
The gun was discovered

824
00:39:41,534 --> 00:39:44,649
in the left hand
of Monsieur Chevenix.

825
00:39:44,953 --> 00:39:47,336
Good. My card.

826
00:39:47,643 --> 00:39:48,999
And yet
from our very first meeting,

827
00:39:49,256 --> 00:39:52,262
I knew that Monsieur Chevenix
was right-handed.

828
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:56,058
But if the bullet
was fired from behind...

829
00:39:56,364 --> 00:39:58,211
Hastings?

830
00:39:58,477 --> 00:40:00,292
<i>Comme 軋,</i>

831
00:40:00,552 --> 00:40:01,830
how could it possibly
hit the mirror,

832
00:40:02,127 --> 00:40:03,668
which is to the side?

833
00:40:03,971 --> 00:40:04,933
It couldn't have.

834
00:40:05,201 --> 00:40:06,010
<i>Non.</i>

835
00:40:06,277 --> 00:40:07,282
So now let us suppose

836
00:40:07,544 --> 00:40:09,009
that the door to the study
was open.

837
00:40:09,274 --> 00:40:10,781
If you please, Monsieur Snell.

838
00:40:16,188 --> 00:40:17,730
Thank you.

839
00:40:17,995 --> 00:40:20,147
And again, Hastings?

840
00:40:20,453 --> 00:40:22,922
The gun comme 軋.

841
00:40:24,295 --> 00:40:26,842
It would've hit the gong.

842
00:40:27,138 --> 00:40:29,138
So that was the gong I heard.

843
00:40:29,405 --> 00:40:31,219
Well, then how did the mirror
get broken?

844
00:40:31,479 --> 00:40:34,714
The murderer wanted to make
an appearance of suicide.

845
00:40:34,976 --> 00:40:37,324
But what if the sound
of the gong has been heard?

846
00:40:37,626 --> 00:40:39,517
Then it would be known
that the door to the study

847
00:40:39,778 --> 00:40:41,516
was open and not closed.

848
00:40:41,775 --> 00:40:45,010
Quickly, the door is closed

849
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:47,388
and locked.

850
00:40:47,654 --> 00:40:48,660
The gun is placed

851
00:40:48,661 --> 00:40:51,156
into the left hand
of the dead man.

852
00:40:51,419 --> 00:40:53,615
The key goes into the pocket.

853
00:40:53,916 --> 00:40:57,074
The suicide note of one word
is easily forged

854
00:40:57,336 --> 00:41:00,418
and the mirror
deliberately smashed.

855
00:41:00,716 --> 00:41:02,181
[glass shatters]

856
00:41:04,175 --> 00:41:05,332
When I first came here,

857
00:41:05,634 --> 00:41:07,252
you will remember,
Chief Inspector,

858
00:41:07,556 --> 00:41:09,554
that I discovered a fragment
of the looking glass

859
00:41:09,821 --> 00:41:11,669
attached to this brass ornament,

860
00:41:11,935 --> 00:41:15,399
the base of which
was also slightly damaged.

861
00:41:15,661 --> 00:41:18,392
It was then
that I saw the light.

862
00:41:18,658 --> 00:41:20,353
So what happened then?

863
00:41:20,618 --> 00:41:22,279
How did the killer leave?

864
00:41:22,538 --> 00:41:25,391
The killer left
through the window,

865
00:41:25,689 --> 00:41:28,694
cleverly closing the latch
from the outside.

866
00:41:28,955 --> 00:41:29,839

867
00:41:30,107 --> 00:41:31,114
<i>Voil・</i>

868
00:41:31,413 --> 00:41:32,452
So who was it?

869
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:35,266
Who was the murderer?

870
00:41:37,676 --> 00:41:41,412
Who entered the house
that night from the garden?

871
00:41:42,556 --> 00:41:44,936
And who would have lost
everything

872
00:41:45,207 --> 00:41:49,325
if Monsieur Chevenix had lived
to sign his new will?

873
00:41:49,624 --> 00:41:50,936
What new will?

874
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,319
The will that disinherited you
completely

875
00:41:53,619 --> 00:41:55,817
if you did not marry
Monsieur Hugo Trent.

876
00:41:56,078 --> 00:41:57,893
But it was too late,
Madame Lake,

877
00:41:58,153 --> 00:41:59,661
for you were already married.

878
00:41:59,921 --> 00:42:00,882
" No!

879
00:42:01,188 --> 00:42:02,182
You're wrong!

880
00:42:02,183 --> 00:42:03,139
Stop him!

881
00:42:03,406 --> 00:42:05,016
<i>Non, monsieur,</i>
Poirot is never wrong.

882
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,312
The will,
it was left in this room.

883
00:42:06,579 --> 00:42:07,655
You could have seen it
at any time.

884
00:42:07,956 --> 00:42:09,718
But it was too late to undo
what you had already done.

885
00:42:09,982 --> 00:42:10,863
Oh, yes, you were married

886
00:42:11,129 --> 00:42:12,706
but to the man
your guardian most disliked.

887
00:42:12,965 --> 00:42:14,193
I was going to tell him.

888
00:42:14,494 --> 00:42:15,603
I hated lying.

889
00:42:15,871 --> 00:42:17,142
I'd planned to tell him
that very night.

890
00:42:17,438 --> 00:42:18,939
Non, not to tell him, madame--
to kill him.

891
00:42:19,197 --> 00:42:20,307
You're wrong!

892
00:42:20,574 --> 00:42:21,922
There's not a word of truth
in your story.

893
00:42:22,216 --> 00:42:24,327
It's a lie from start to finish.

894
00:42:25,849 --> 00:42:29,192
That is for a jury to decide.

895
00:42:35,027 --> 00:42:36,720

00:42:41,439 --> 00:42:42,554
Yes, yes.

898
00:42:42,822 --> 00:42:44,710
Good night, Hugo.

899
00:42:44,972 --> 00:42:46,894
Good night,
Mrs. Chevenix.

Poor Ruth.

901
00:42:55,877 --> 00:42:56,883

It's Safra, Vanda.

909
00:43:50,787 --> 00:43:55,014

914
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:23,506
You killed him.

915
00:44:23,772 --> 00:44:24,657
No.

916
00:44:24,924 --> 00:44:31,990
You know it was.
You killed Gervase.

917
00:44:32,257 --> 00:44:35,567
Come down.

918
00:44:35,828 --> 00:44:38,866
Come down!

919
00:44:44,622 --> 00:44:46,774
You killed him

920
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,123
because you hated him.

921
00:44:49,384 --> 00:44:53,228
Now you must make amends!

922
00:44:53,492 --> 00:44:54,803
I didn't.

923
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:57,263
What have you hidden

924
00:44:57,524 --> 00:44:59,830
in your locket, Vanda?

925
00:45:01,173 --> 00:45:05,367
The bullet
that killed your husband!

926
00:45:05,627 --> 00:45:07,593
No.

927
00:45:11,732 --> 00:45:17,193
You must write a note
admitting it!

928
00:45:19,719 --> 00:45:22,984
And then...

929
00:45:23,252 --> 00:45:25,140
No.

930
00:45:30,855 --> 00:45:32,439
It is enough.

931
00:45:36,461 --> 00:45:37,651
I knew that you would
try something,

932
00:45:37,958 --> 00:45:38,963
Mademoiselle Lingard.

933
00:45:39,226 --> 00:45:40,886
But this?

934
00:45:41,146 --> 00:45:42,456
It's diabolical.

935
00:45:42,757 --> 00:45:45,106
I had to save her.

936
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:47,871
I had to save Ruth.

937
00:45:48,134 --> 00:45:50,024
Yes, I know.

938
00:45:50,285 --> 00:45:51,322
And in order to save her,

939
00:45:51,628 --> 00:45:54,053
you killed
Monsieur Gervase Chevenix.

940
00:45:55,661 --> 00:45:56,775
And you are the real mother

941
00:45:57,042 --> 00:45:58,855
of Ruth Chevenix,
are you not?

942
00:45:59,155 --> 00:46:00,694
The typist
with whom the brother

943
00:46:00,998 --> 00:46:03,466
of Monsieur Gervase Chevenix
fell in love.

944
00:46:03,723 --> 00:46:05,308
How did you know?

945
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:08,188
There could be
no other explanation.

946
00:46:08,447 --> 00:46:11,756
And in the museum,
that was when I saw.

947
00:46:12,018 --> 00:46:15,940
But it's
such a beautiful painting,

948
00:46:16,203 --> 00:46:18,278
so sad.

949
00:46:20,503 --> 00:46:24,316
It was a painting of a mother
who loses her child.

950
00:46:24,574 --> 00:46:26,496
And it was then that I saw

951
00:46:26,763 --> 00:46:28,577
that you were also a mother

952
00:46:28,876 --> 00:46:31,223
who had lost her child.

953
00:46:31,486 --> 00:46:32,993
And you came to this house,
I think,

954
00:46:33,252 --> 00:46:35,022
to check up on the daughter
that you had lost,

955
00:46:35,288 --> 00:46:38,553
so you took up the position
of a researcher.

956
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:40,971
Yes.

957
00:46:41,239 --> 00:46:42,856
And while you were working,

958
00:46:43,121 --> 00:46:46,507
you stumbled
across the new will.

959
00:46:46,768 --> 00:46:50,187
He was going to ruin her life
with his...

960
00:46:50,455 --> 00:46:53,612
pride and his snobbery.

961
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:58,138
And so you decided to take
matters into your own hand.

962
00:46:58,403 --> 00:46:59,988
You killed
Monsieur Gervase Chevenix

963
00:47:00,247 --> 00:47:02,825
exactly as I described.

964
00:47:03,088 --> 00:47:05,436
You then left the study,

965
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:09,195
taking care to leave
no footprints in the soil.

966
00:47:09,463 --> 00:47:10,652
[water burbling]

967
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,459
But unknown to you,

968
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,685
a few moments later,
Ruth Chevenix appeared

969
00:47:18,985 --> 00:47:21,487
in search of a brooch
which she had lost.

970
00:47:25,129 --> 00:47:26,483
She found it

971
00:47:26,742 --> 00:47:30,510
but, in doing so,
left behind her own footprints.

972
00:47:30,774 --> 00:47:32,238
It was then necessary
to continue

973
00:47:32,501 --> 00:47:33,736
the illusion of suicide

974
00:47:33,999 --> 00:47:36,543
and to establish
a false time of death.

975
00:47:36,802 --> 00:47:39,227
It was very clever,
that idea of yours

976
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:40,375
to imitate a gun.

977
00:47:40,642 --> 00:47:42,226
[cork pops loudly]

978
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:46,220
You then went
into the living room

979
00:47:46,479 --> 00:47:49,285
and were there
when Ruth Chevenix came in.

980
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:55,321
Good evening, Miss Ruth.

981
00:47:55,579 --> 00:47:57,655
Oh, good evening,
Miss Lingard.

982
00:47:57,922 --> 00:48:00,194
I found it most significant
that you did not tell to me

983
00:48:00,456 --> 00:48:01,844
that Ruth Chevenix
entered the living room

984
00:48:02,146 --> 00:48:03,380
from the garden.

985
00:48:03,643 --> 00:48:05,915
Well, how could I?

986
00:48:06,178 --> 00:48:08,449
It would have incriminated her.

987
00:48:10,363 --> 00:48:12,985
And there was now
but one thing left to do:

988
00:48:13,243 --> 00:48:15,089
the bullet.

989
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:16,628
I found it by the gong

990
00:48:16,891 --> 00:48:20,309
when you were
breaking open the door.

991
00:48:20,577 --> 00:48:23,919
I wanted to drop it
inside the study,

992
00:48:24,225 --> 00:48:26,847
but I didn't get the chance.

993
00:48:27,144 --> 00:48:29,918
And the cuff link
of Monsieur Trent?

994
00:48:31,175 --> 00:48:33,294
I stole that from his room.

995
00:48:33,556 --> 00:48:36,942
I knew you'd seen me
picking up the bullet,

996
00:48:37,203 --> 00:48:39,093
so I had to have
something to show you.

997
00:48:39,393 --> 00:48:40,582
Yes.

998
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:45,275
You almost succeeded
in confusing Poirot.

999
00:48:47,725 --> 00:48:48,839
Chief Inspector.

1000
00:48:51,373 --> 00:48:54,409
I think you'd better come
along with me, Miss Lingard.

1001
00:48:57,671 --> 00:49:00,292
[whispering]
Mr. Poirot.

1002
00:49:00,589 --> 00:49:03,592
I don't want Ruth to see me.

1003
00:49:03,852 --> 00:49:06,473
I don't care
what happens to me,

1004
00:49:06,732 --> 00:49:09,278
but please...

1005
00:49:10,495 --> 00:49:12,538
Don't let her see me.

1006
00:49:18,636 --> 00:49:21,410
You have my word.

1007
00:49:21,707 --> 00:49:24,088
Thank you.
