1
00:01:37,042 --> 00:01:40,291
- "My dear Horace,
we were all disappointed

2
00:01:40,584 --> 00:01:43,416
"not to see you
at our conference in Berlin.

3
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:47,583
"England is in danger
of becoming isolated, you know.

4
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:50,333
"Many interesting developments
were discussed,

5
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:51,708
"in particular,

6
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,583
"Sir Rueben Astwell's
new Astoprene compound.

7
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:58,166
"It's rumored that Farben's
over here

8
00:01:58,459 --> 00:02:00,416
"will manufacture it
under license,

9
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:05,458
but then, you know what gossips
scientists can be."

10
00:03:32,584 --> 00:03:34,666
- You.

11
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:44,249
Help me.

12
00:04:12,167 --> 00:04:14,374
- Oh, you're not trying,
Mr. Poirot.

13
00:04:14,667 --> 00:04:17,458
- Miss Lemon, I am aware
that you are fully qualified

14
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,833
in the practice
of the hypnotics,

15
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,666
and I do not dismiss that,

16
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,374
but, you know, with a person
whose character is so forceful

17
00:04:24,667 --> 00:04:26,083
and whose intellect
is so powerful...

18
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:29,833
- But think how useful it'd be
to you in your investigations.

19
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:33,249
- Very well,
if it will please you, proceed.

20
00:04:40,042 --> 00:04:42,541
- Relax.

21
00:04:42,834 --> 00:04:46,333
Relax.

22
00:04:46,917 --> 00:04:50,583
Your eyes are feeling heavy.

23
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:55,291
You are going to sleep.

24
00:05:00,042 --> 00:05:01,291
- What on Earth's going on?

25
00:05:01,584 --> 00:05:04,374
Please, Captain Hastings.

26
00:05:09,084 --> 00:05:10,291
- Oh, sorry.

27
00:05:10,584 --> 00:05:11,499
I just wanted to know

28
00:05:11,792 --> 00:05:13,249
what time he wanted to leave
in the morning

29
00:05:13,542 --> 00:05:15,166
for the Captain's Plate
at Abbot's Cross.

30
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:17,499
- Mr. Poirot didn't tell me
about that.

31
00:05:17,792 --> 00:05:19,124
- I did tell you, Miss Lemon.

32
00:05:19,417 --> 00:05:21,374
You simply forgot to enter it.

33
00:05:21,667 --> 00:05:25,374
- Mr. Poirot, I am trying
to be helpful.

34
00:05:25,667 --> 00:05:26,999
- Miss Lemon,
I am very grateful to you,

35
00:05:27,292 --> 00:05:29,499
but really, I have no need
of the hypnotics.

36
00:05:29,792 --> 00:05:32,333
I prefer to use
my little gray cells.

37
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,791
Hastings, thank you for coming.

38
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:37,333
I thought we might make
an early start in the morning.

39
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:39,291
- What's this Captain's Plate?

40
00:05:39,584 --> 00:05:42,041
- Well, it's a golf trophy,
of course, two-day event.

41
00:05:42,334 --> 00:05:43,583
A friend of mine,
Charles Leverson,

42
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:44,874
has invited me to partner him.

43
00:05:45,167 --> 00:05:46,541
- Surely you're far too busy

44
00:05:46,834 --> 00:05:48,749
to attend golf matches,
Mr. Poirot.

45
00:05:49,042 --> 00:05:50,124
- Yes, I am, Miss Lemon,

46
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:53,416
but there is another invitation
I could not resist.

47
00:05:53,709 --> 00:05:56,416
The uncle of Monsieur Leverson
is Sir Rueben Astwell,

48
00:05:56,709 --> 00:05:58,791
and we have been invited
to dine with him.

49
00:05:59,084 --> 00:06:00,999
He has the finest collection

50
00:06:01,292 --> 00:06:03,541
of Belgian miniature bronzes
in Europe.

51
00:06:03,834 --> 00:06:05,166
And Belgian miniature bronzes,

52
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:06,708
they are the finest
in the world.

53
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:08,249
- Why is that?

54
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:10,249
- Because they are the largest.

55
00:06:10,542 --> 00:06:14,333
Truly, Sir Rueben Astwell
must be a man of exquisite taste

56
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,708
and sensitivity.

57
00:06:19,667 --> 00:06:21,541
- I want that letter
off to I.G. Farben today.

58
00:06:21,834 --> 00:06:22,749
- I've been thinking, Rueben,

59
00:06:23,042 --> 00:06:24,416
I'm not sure we're doing
the right thing.

60
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:26,083
- I'll do any thinking
that's necessary.

61
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,291
- As your partner,
I'm entitled to my opinion.

62
00:06:28,584 --> 00:06:30,083
- As my junior partner,

63
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,499
you're entitled
to do what I say.

64
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:35,333
Victor, don't think
you can take liberties

65
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:37,499
just because you're my brother.

66
00:06:44,042 --> 00:06:47,916
Well, this is a right mess,
isn't it?

67
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:48,999
- I'm afraid so--

68
00:06:49,292 --> 00:06:50,416
- Don't tell me
it was an accident.

69
00:06:50,709 --> 00:06:52,166
More like damn carelessness.

70
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:54,416
- No, sir.

71
00:06:54,709 --> 00:06:56,791
It wasn't an accident.

72
00:06:58,584 --> 00:06:59,416
- Are you sure it was him?

73
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:00,874
- There's no question,
Sir Rueben.

74
00:07:01,167 --> 00:07:02,083
I saw his face quite clearly.

75
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:03,541
- Then we know what he
was after.

76
00:07:03,834 --> 00:07:05,666
- Yes, I've put it
in your brother's office.

77
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,874
- I think this will be safer
with me.

78
00:07:37,584 --> 00:07:38,541
- Monsieur Poirot?

79
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:41,041
You're in room 12.

80
00:07:41,334 --> 00:07:43,374
Mr. Hastings, room 13.

81
00:07:43,667 --> 00:07:45,208
- Thank you.
- Merci beaucoup.

82
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,083
Thank you, sir.

83
00:08:06,042 --> 00:08:07,124
- Well, I'd have to say

84
00:08:07,417 --> 00:08:08,833
we've got some pretty stiff
competition, Charles.

85
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:09,916
- Don't worry, old boy.

86
00:08:10,209 --> 00:08:11,208
I've been putting in
hours of practice,

87
00:08:12,042 --> 00:08:14,166
and I know these greens
like the back of my hand.

88
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:15,583
- Such dedication.

89
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:16,624
- Do you play, Mr. Poirot?

90
00:08:16,917 --> 00:08:19,458
- Rarely, Monsieur Leverson.

91
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,374
I must confess,
I owe my presence here

92
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:22,708
more to art than to sport.

93
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,333
- Charles.
- Ah.

94
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,083
- Here I am.
Good luck.

95
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:27,333
- Thanks, Lily.

96
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:30,958
Miss Lily Margrave,
my aunt's companion.

97
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,374
Let me introduce my partner,
Captain Hastings.

98
00:08:33,667 --> 00:08:34,583
- How do you do, Miss Margrave?

99
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:35,791
- How do you do?

100
00:08:36,084 --> 00:08:38,416
- And this is
Mr. Hercule Poirot.

101
00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:39,749
- Enchanté, mademoiselle.

102
00:08:40,042 --> 00:08:41,624
- How do you do, Mr. Poirot?

103
00:08:41,917 --> 00:08:43,874
When Charles told me
you were coming to dinner,

104
00:08:44,167 --> 00:08:45,166
I was so excited.

105
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:46,499
- Ah.

106
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,166
- Did the fire cause
much damage, then?

107
00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:20,916
- Nothing that can't be
repaired.

108
00:09:24,209 --> 00:09:26,749
I've got Trefusis coming down
this weekend

109
00:09:27,042 --> 00:09:29,958
to discuss what needs
to be done.

110
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,833
He's staying for dinner.

111
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:34,374
- We've already got
dinner guests.

112
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:37,499
- Well, that's
damned inconvenient.

113
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,166
- I did tell you.

114
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:43,291
They're friends of Charles'.

115
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,708
- Charles takes too much
for granted.

116
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,041
- Oh, very.

117
00:10:02,084 --> 00:10:02,958
- Excuse me, sir.

118
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,541
Sir Rueben would like
a word with you.

119
00:10:04,834 --> 00:10:06,708
- Ugh.
- He's in the billiard room.

120
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,624
- Thank you, Parsons.

121
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:11,374
Daft.

122
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,124
- You wanted to see me, Uncle?

123
00:10:16,417 --> 00:10:19,291
- Yes, and you know what about.

124
00:10:19,584 --> 00:10:22,583
You've had all week
to think it over.

125
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:24,999
- Well, I did think it over,

126
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:29,083
but, well, I mean,
working for the firm,

127
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,333
it's not really my cup of tea,
is it?

128
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:36,041
- Oh, no, and what exactly
is your cup of tea?

129
00:10:36,334 --> 00:10:37,416
- Well, actually,
I had some idea

130
00:10:37,709 --> 00:10:38,749
of becoming a golf professional.

131
00:10:39,042 --> 00:10:40,791
- Playing golf?

132
00:10:41,084 --> 00:10:42,541
That's your idea of a job?

133
00:10:42,834 --> 00:10:44,666
- Well, I hadn't really
thought it through.

134
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:45,958
I mean, earlier on today, I--

135
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,083
- Last year, you wanted
to become a photographer.

136
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,333
- Well, if you'd loaned me
the money in the first place--

137
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,791
- You have had all the money
you're going to get.

138
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:22,333
- Lady Astwell thought she might
have left her reading glasses

139
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:23,999
on your desk.

140
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,999
- Did she?

141
00:11:30,292 --> 00:11:31,833
- Well, she must have made
a mistake.

142
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:37,791
- She's not the only one
who's mistaken, Miss Margrave.

143
00:11:38,084 --> 00:11:40,333
And this isn't the first time
I've caught you in here

144
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:41,958
messing around with my papers.

145
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,624
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

146
00:11:43,917 --> 00:11:44,708
- No?

147
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,541
- Please let go of my arm.

148
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,708
- I want you out of this house
first thing on Monday morning.

149
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,791
Your services
are no longer required.

150
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:29,999
- Lily.

151
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:31,416
Over here.

152
00:12:36,792 --> 00:12:38,749
I found it.

153
00:12:39,042 --> 00:12:39,958
- Where?

154
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,833
- It's in his study.

155
00:12:52,042 --> 00:12:53,499
- War, Poirot.

156
00:12:53,792 --> 00:12:58,208
That's what I said,
and war is what I mean.

157
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,958
And it's coming soon,
you mark my words.

158
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:04,041
- With anyone in particular,
Sir Rueben?

159
00:13:04,334 --> 00:13:06,208
- Germany, of course.

160
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,708
They're rearming.

161
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,958
They've remilitarized
the Rhineland.

162
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,541
They'll be all over Europe
before you know it.

163
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:14,708
Probably start with your place,
um, Belgium.

164
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,916
Shouldn't take them long.

165
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:21,041
- You will forgive me,
Sir Rueben,

166
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:26,041
if I do not view the prospect
with such sangfroid.

167
00:13:26,334 --> 00:13:27,958
I myself have experienced it
firsthand,

168
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,624
the horror and destruction
of war with Germany.

169
00:13:30,917 --> 00:13:33,999
- Well, I'm not saying that war
is a nice business.

170
00:13:34,292 --> 00:13:35,708
But business it is.

171
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,124
- War and chemicals
go hand in glove.

172
00:13:39,417 --> 00:13:42,458
- There are more important
things than business.

173
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,499
- Business will not be
the only beneficiary.

174
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:48,999
Think of the great strides
that science will make:

175
00:13:49,292 --> 00:13:51,999
new fuels, new alloys--

176
00:13:52,292 --> 00:13:55,166
- And it'll do wonders
for the economy.

177
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,499
Do you know how many unemployed
we have today?

178
00:13:57,792 --> 00:14:00,041
More than a million.

179
00:14:00,334 --> 00:14:03,999
More than a million
scrounging on the dole.

180
00:14:07,917 --> 00:14:10,499
- War seems
a pretty drastic solution.

181
00:14:11,792 --> 00:14:13,916
- I think I agree with Victor.

182
00:14:14,209 --> 00:14:15,458
- As well you would, Nancy.

183
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,666
Never could face facts.

184
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:20,041
Always the great actress.

185
00:14:30,917 --> 00:14:33,333
- Could we talk about something
a little more pleasant?

186
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,333
- Exquisite.

187
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,833
Parfait.

188
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:47,666
Oh, mon dieu.

189
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:50,999
Hastings, this is undoubtedly
the work of Auguste Clouet.

190
00:14:51,292 --> 00:14:52,208
And Auguste Clouet,

191
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,541
he is one of the finest
craftsmen in Liège.

192
00:14:54,834 --> 00:14:55,624
- Fascinating.

193
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,458
- Oh, magnifique.

194
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,874
C'est incroyable.
A Tindemann?

195
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:07,958
A genuine Jules Tindemann?

196
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,416
The whole collection,
it is magnificent.

197
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:11,833
- Is it?

198
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:14,374
I got it at a knockdown price.

199
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:19,208
I'm hoping to sell it
for a profit.

200
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,583
- But how can you bear
the sacrifice?

201
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,249
- Sacrifice?

202
00:15:23,542 --> 00:15:24,666
Oh, as far as I'm concerned,

203
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,583
whoever buys them
can melt them down for scrap.

204
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:33,666
- Never, Hastings.

205
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:36,666
Never have I met a man
so obnoxious,

206
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,416
and I swear,
that wine he to gave us,

207
00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:41,458
he manufactured
in his chemical factory.

208
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:45,958
Not the most pleasant evening,
I'll agree.

209
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,291
Sorry about the bronzes.

210
00:15:47,584 --> 00:15:49,749
- That such a philistine
should have them in his custody,

211
00:15:50,042 --> 00:15:52,541
it is an offense against art
and justice.

212
00:15:52,834 --> 00:15:53,874
- I say...

213
00:15:58,334 --> 00:16:00,416
I thought I'd walk you back
to your hotel.

214
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,249
I could do with a spot
of fresh air.

215
00:16:02,542 --> 00:16:03,583
- Oh, right.

216
00:16:05,042 --> 00:16:06,749
- Yes, I think I should
retire now.

217
00:16:07,042 --> 00:16:09,874
Thank you for a most enjoyable
evening, Lady Astwell.

218
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:12,583
- Good night, Mr. Trefusis.

219
00:16:15,834 --> 00:16:17,249
That'll be all, Parsons.

220
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:19,124
- Very good, your ladyship.

221
00:16:21,209 --> 00:16:23,041
- Tell me, Monsieur Leverson,

222
00:16:23,334 --> 00:16:25,458
in order to deserve
a knighthood,

223
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,833
your uncle must have rendered
some service most special,

224
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:29,124
n'est-ce pas?

225
00:16:29,417 --> 00:16:32,166
- Bought and paid for,
like everything else.

226
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:38,749
The man's a monster, a bully,
and a liar.

227
00:16:39,042 --> 00:16:42,374
A liar, Mr. Poirot.

228
00:16:46,834 --> 00:16:49,291
- I'm surprised at Lady Astwell
putting up with it.

229
00:16:49,584 --> 00:16:53,249
- Well, I'm not going to work
in his blasted factory.

230
00:16:55,334 --> 00:16:56,916
I'll show him.

231
00:16:58,792 --> 00:16:59,958
- I don't want to hear any more

232
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,666
of this sentimental,
patriotic claptrap.

233
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,208
We're in business to make money,

234
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,833
and the Germans are willing
to pay it.

235
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,958
- No, what we are selling them

236
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,749
will be used
for military purposes.

237
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:14,291
- Victor.

238
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:17,624
- He's insufferable.

239
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:30,208
- About Lily.

240
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,874
- I've told you, Nancy,
she's going,

241
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:33,124
and that's
all there is to it.

242
00:17:33,417 --> 00:17:34,416
- Don't I have any say
in the matter?

243
00:17:34,709 --> 00:17:35,749
- Hired help are ten a penny.

244
00:17:36,042 --> 00:17:37,458
You can get another one.

245
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,583
- Oh.

246
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:21,041
I've just about had as much
as I'm going to take.

247
00:18:22,542 --> 00:18:23,916
My God.

248
00:18:28,709 --> 00:18:30,624
No harm done.

249
00:18:32,459 --> 00:18:33,833
Good night.

250
00:19:20,667 --> 00:19:21,541
- Nothing at all.

251
00:19:21,834 --> 00:19:22,624
Stay in the grass.

252
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:23,666
Mind yourselves.

253
00:19:23,917 --> 00:19:25,458
Stay in the grass.
Let's go.

254
00:19:41,917 --> 00:19:45,624
- Quick blow to the head
saw him off, I'd say.

255
00:19:45,917 --> 00:19:47,333
There's the murder weapon.

256
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,583
- If I might ask, sir,

257
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,708
in what condition
was Mr. Leverson

258
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,708
when he left you last night?

259
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,833
- In a state of the most
regrettable inebriations.

260
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:07,874
Why do you ask?

261
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:09,041
- Well, it sounds as though

262
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:12,166
he was the last one
to see his uncle alive.

263
00:20:12,459 --> 00:20:14,833
Parsons, the butler,
heard Mr. Leverson

264
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:16,833
having an argument
with his uncle.

265
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,916
Couldn't hear exactly
what they were saying.

266
00:20:19,209 --> 00:20:19,999
- You have, of course,

267
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,124
questioned Monsieur Leverson
himself.

268
00:20:21,417 --> 00:20:22,416
- I did, sir.

269
00:20:22,709 --> 00:20:24,541
He admitted that they'd had
a quarrel.

270
00:20:24,834 --> 00:20:27,624
But he says they patched it up.

271
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,874
- Well, suppose I can say
good-bye to the golf tournament.

272
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,999
- It would be indecent
to do otherwise.

273
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:24,833
- Oh, excuse me, sir.

274
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:26,499
I'll do your room.

275
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,416
- If you please,
Monsieur Astwell,

276
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:35,624
at what time did you leave the
study of Sir Rueben last night?

277
00:21:35,917 --> 00:21:37,458
- About 11:15.

278
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,208
We'd been discussing
some business matters.

279
00:21:42,792 --> 00:21:44,499
- Excuse me, your ladyship.

280
00:21:46,334 --> 00:21:50,499
Mr. Leverson's bedroom door
appears to be locked.

281
00:22:03,167 --> 00:22:04,833
He's run for it.

282
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:07,041
He can't have gone far.

283
00:22:07,334 --> 00:22:09,416
Right, in the cars.

284
00:22:46,584 --> 00:22:48,291
Whoa.

285
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:52,208
- Come on, then.

286
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,124
This way.

287
00:23:08,042 --> 00:23:09,083
- All right, grab him.

288
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:10,416
- Got him, Sergeant.

289
00:23:10,709 --> 00:23:12,749
- Come on, be sensible.

290
00:23:19,959 --> 00:23:21,624
- Chin up, Nancy.

291
00:23:21,917 --> 00:23:23,041
If he did it in a sudden temper,

292
00:23:23,334 --> 00:23:24,624
it would be treated
as manslaughter.

293
00:23:24,917 --> 00:23:26,666
- But he didn't do it, Victor.

294
00:23:28,209 --> 00:23:29,833
- Oh, excuse me.

295
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:32,041
- You don't believe it either,
do you, Mr. Poirot?

296
00:23:32,334 --> 00:23:33,624
- Believe what, Lady Astwell?

297
00:23:33,917 --> 00:23:35,458
- That Charles murdered
my husband.

298
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:36,749
- Well...
- No, I know.

299
00:23:37,042 --> 00:23:38,291
I know all the facts
are against him,

300
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:42,958
but I tell you, Mr. Poirot,
I tell you he's innocent.

301
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:45,416
- And the reason for your
certainty, Lady Astwell?

302
00:23:46,542 --> 00:23:47,333
- Intuition.

303
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:50,833
- Ah, yes, the female intuition,
huh?

304
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:53,666
Lady Astwell,
if you'd be so kind,

305
00:23:53,959 --> 00:23:57,541
the will of your husband
and his estate,

306
00:23:57,834 --> 00:23:59,374
to whom was it left?

307
00:23:59,667 --> 00:24:02,833
- Uh, half to me,
half to Victor.

308
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:05,749
- And Monsieur Leverson?

309
00:24:07,292 --> 00:24:09,874
- Well, his mother,
Rueben's sister,

310
00:24:10,167 --> 00:24:11,916
knew that he was
a bit scatterbrained,

311
00:24:12,209 --> 00:24:14,083
so she left her estate
in Rueben's hands

312
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:15,458
on condition
that he made Charles

313
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,291
a reasonable allowance.

314
00:24:17,584 --> 00:24:19,166
It was almost
a deathbed promise.

315
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:20,874
- Which he kept?

316
00:24:21,167 --> 00:24:23,833
- Until yesterday...

317
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:26,583
Well, my husband threatened to
cut Charles off without a penny

318
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:28,916
unless he took a job
with the firm.

319
00:24:29,209 --> 00:24:31,624
- I see.

320
00:24:32,459 --> 00:24:34,041
Tell me, Lady Astwell,
last night,

321
00:24:34,334 --> 00:24:36,874
you came to the study
to see your husband.

322
00:24:37,167 --> 00:24:39,458
About what?

323
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:42,624
- Oh, oh, that was just
some domestic matter.

324
00:24:42,917 --> 00:24:45,624
- You had a quarrel.

325
00:24:50,792 --> 00:24:55,416
- He was making the most
absurd allegations against Lily,

326
00:24:55,709 --> 00:24:58,458
accusing her of interfering
with his private papers,

327
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,833
spying.

328
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:02,749
Lily's a dear girl.

329
00:25:03,042 --> 00:25:06,333
I regard her as I would
a favorite niece.

330
00:25:06,625 --> 00:25:08,208
Charles is very fond of her.

331
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,541
You know she came
with excellent references.

332
00:25:11,834 --> 00:25:13,708
- Might I see these references?

333
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,666
- Is that really necessary?

334
00:25:15,959 --> 00:25:18,791
- Just to satisfy my curiosity.

335
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:26,333
- I've come to see Mr. Naylor.

336
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:28,874
- Mr. Naylor appears to be out
at the moment, miss.

337
00:25:29,167 --> 00:25:30,749
I don't know when he'll be back.

338
00:25:31,042 --> 00:25:32,499
Can I take a message?

339
00:25:32,792 --> 00:25:35,083
- Oh, well.

340
00:25:35,375 --> 00:25:36,958
Please give him this
when he returns.

341
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,249
He's expecting it.

342
00:25:38,542 --> 00:25:40,041
- Certainly, miss.

343
00:25:49,917 --> 00:25:51,958
- I don't know what things
are coming to, Gladys.

344
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:55,791
Policemen and detectives
all over the place.

345
00:25:56,084 --> 00:25:57,833
Expect it will be the press
next.

346
00:25:58,125 --> 00:25:59,166
- Oh, well, do you think

347
00:25:59,459 --> 00:26:01,541
I'll get my picture
in the paper, Mr. Parsons?

348
00:26:03,042 --> 00:26:04,916
- Monsieur Parsons,
a word with you, if I may?

349
00:26:05,209 --> 00:26:06,416
- Certainly, sir.

350
00:26:10,417 --> 00:26:11,624
- Excuse me.

351
00:26:13,667 --> 00:26:15,208
Monsieur Parsons,

352
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,083
I understand that last night
you heard Monsieur Leverson

353
00:26:18,375 --> 00:26:20,333
having the arguments
with Sir Rueben.

354
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:22,624
- Yes, sir, I heard him cry out.

355
00:26:22,917 --> 00:26:24,749
Then there was a heavy thud.

356
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:28,874
Mr. Leverson shouted, "My God."

357
00:26:29,167 --> 00:26:33,083
- Did you try to ascertain
the reason for this disturbance?

358
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:34,333
- I did, sir.

359
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:35,541
I went out of my room

360
00:26:35,834 --> 00:26:40,791
and listened at the foot
of the back stairs.

361
00:26:41,084 --> 00:26:44,583
I heard Mr. Leverson call out,
"No harm done,"

362
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:48,583
and then he went off, whistling,
as cheery as you like, sir.

363
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:50,124
- Ow!

364
00:26:50,417 --> 00:26:51,833
- What have you done now, girl?

365
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:53,249
- Cut myself.

366
00:26:53,542 --> 00:26:55,208
There's a bit of metal
sticking out of the table.

367
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,749
- Allow me, mademoiselle.

368
00:26:57,917 --> 00:26:58,958
Voilà.

369
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:08,333
Monsieur Parsons,

370
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:12,124
have you noticed if any
of your cutlery, it is damaged?

371
00:27:12,417 --> 00:27:13,374
- As it happens,

372
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:15,541
one of the knives
is missing its point, sir.

373
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:17,374
- Hm, I think
you will find it here,

374
00:27:17,667 --> 00:27:19,458
embedded in the table.

375
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,541
- Oh, thank you, sir.
I'll see to it.

376
00:27:21,834 --> 00:27:23,666
And you get a bandage
around that, Gladys.

377
00:27:23,959 --> 00:27:25,458
- Yes, Mr. Parsons.

378
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,249
I'll wash your handkerchief
for you, sir.

379
00:27:27,542 --> 00:27:29,249
- No, no, no, no,
Mademoiselle Gladys, thank you.

380
00:27:29,542 --> 00:27:31,249
There is no need.
You are most kind.

381
00:27:31,542 --> 00:27:32,583
- Oh.

382
00:28:02,042 --> 00:28:03,499
- Your business discussion
last night

383
00:28:03,792 --> 00:28:06,249
with Sir Rueben, your brother,
it was friendly?

384
00:28:06,542 --> 00:28:08,666
- Why should it have been
otherwise?

385
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:10,874
- Because I detected
at the dinner table

386
00:28:11,167 --> 00:28:12,874
a certain tension.

387
00:28:13,167 --> 00:28:15,166
- Yes, well, we did have
a disagreement.

388
00:28:15,459 --> 00:28:16,249
- A quarrel?

389
00:28:16,542 --> 00:28:17,541
- I wouldn't call it that.

390
00:28:17,834 --> 00:28:19,374
A heated argument.

391
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,333
It was over this.

392
00:28:24,917 --> 00:28:28,958
We have developed
a synthetic rubber, Astoprene.

393
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:31,916
Remarkable stuff, made from oil.

394
00:28:32,209 --> 00:28:33,749
Amazing properties.

395
00:28:34,042 --> 00:28:36,666
Strong as mild steel.

396
00:28:36,959 --> 00:28:38,208
High abrasion factor.

397
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,874
Ideal for motor tires.

398
00:28:43,834 --> 00:28:48,749
Rueben intended to license
its manufacture to I.G. Farben.

399
00:28:49,042 --> 00:28:49,958
You've heard of them?

400
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:51,166
- Yes, of course.

401
00:28:51,459 --> 00:28:54,374
They are the largest chemical
manufacturers in Germany.

402
00:28:54,667 --> 00:28:56,708
Do you have the objections?

403
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,749
- It's all academic now.

404
00:28:59,042 --> 00:29:01,458
I'm canceling the transaction.

405
00:29:07,792 --> 00:29:11,958
- I will be with you in just
a moment, Monsieur Poirot.

406
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,541
- Please, Monsieur Trefusis,
do not hurry yourself.

407
00:29:14,834 --> 00:29:16,249
We both know how important it is

408
00:29:16,542 --> 00:29:19,124
to weigh things most carefully,
huh?

409
00:29:28,375 --> 00:29:30,874
- I am at your disposal.

410
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:32,583
- Merci.

411
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:34,416
I am trying to establish
where everyone was

412
00:29:34,709 --> 00:29:36,749
at the time of the murder
of Sir Rueben.

413
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:38,999
- I was sound asleep in bed.

414
00:29:39,292 --> 00:29:41,333
I retired
shortly after you left.

415
00:29:41,625 --> 00:29:42,958
- And you departed
early in the morning?

416
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:45,208
- Yes, before breakfast.

417
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,041
- Last night, you talked
at dinner

418
00:29:48,334 --> 00:29:50,916
about the scientific
developments in Germany.

419
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:53,041
- Did I?

420
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:54,874
- You are fluent
in the language?

421
00:29:55,917 --> 00:29:56,958
- Well, I should be.

422
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:00,208
I worked and studied in Germany
for a number of years.

423
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,208
- You have there
a number of friends?

424
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:06,499
- Oh, I keep in touch
with colleagues.

425
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,541
Well, if you have no further
questions, Monsieur Poirot...

426
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,541
- Thank you, Monsieur Trefusis.

427
00:30:14,834 --> 00:30:17,416
I am very sorry
to have disturbed you.

428
00:30:21,167 --> 00:30:22,666
A vintage year, you would say?

429
00:30:33,209 --> 00:30:35,958
- This is the parcel you've been
waiting for, sir.

430
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,749
- Thank you.
I've enjoyed my stay.

431
00:30:39,042 --> 00:30:40,333
My car is just outside.

432
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:21,124
- "Exhibition Road, London."

433
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,833
- So you say
this Monsieur Naylor

434
00:31:27,125 --> 00:31:28,749
took the parcel with him
when he left the hotel?

435
00:31:29,042 --> 00:31:29,791
- Yes.

436
00:31:30,084 --> 00:31:31,624
- Thank you, Hastings.

437
00:31:31,917 --> 00:31:32,916
- Is that blood, Poirot?

438
00:31:33,209 --> 00:31:35,249
- Yes, Hastings,
but it is not mine.

439
00:31:35,542 --> 00:31:37,666
Gladys, the maid,
she cut her finger

440
00:31:37,959 --> 00:31:39,166
when she found the tip
of a knife

441
00:31:39,459 --> 00:31:42,083
embedded in the table where
Victor Astwell, he was seated.

442
00:31:42,375 --> 00:31:44,541
- You don't suspect him, do you?

443
00:31:44,834 --> 00:31:45,916
- It is by no means certain

444
00:31:46,209 --> 00:31:48,458
that your friend Charles
is the murderer, Hastings.

445
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:51,333
Indeed, Lady Astwell is deeply
convinced that he is not.

446
00:31:51,625 --> 00:31:52,416
- I've never known you

447
00:31:52,709 --> 00:31:55,624
to place much faith
in intuition.

448
00:31:55,917 --> 00:31:59,333
- Intuition, Hastings,
often describes some fact

449
00:31:59,625 --> 00:32:02,749
that is so deeply buried
in the subconscious

450
00:32:03,042 --> 00:32:06,166
that the subject is not aware
of its existence.

451
00:32:07,875 --> 00:32:10,166
- What fact?

452
00:32:10,459 --> 00:32:11,708
Et bien, Hastings.

453
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,041
If I knew that, the case,
it would be solved.

454
00:32:15,334 --> 00:32:17,083
- Lily Margrave's references.

455
00:32:17,375 --> 00:32:20,249
Lady Astwell sent them
by special delivery.

456
00:32:20,542 --> 00:32:22,291
- Thank you, Miss Lemon.

457
00:32:33,042 --> 00:32:35,791
It is indeed most fulsome
in its presence.

458
00:32:36,959 --> 00:32:38,583
Exactement, that is the crest

459
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:41,124
of the Noble Duchess
of Perthshire.

460
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,416
How interesting.

461
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:03,583
- Tell the truth, Charles.

462
00:33:03,875 --> 00:33:05,958
What have you got to lose?

463
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,499
- Oh.

464
00:33:17,625 --> 00:33:20,499
When I arrived back
from the golf club,

465
00:33:20,792 --> 00:33:23,708
I went up to his study.

466
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,333
I was in a bit of a temper,

467
00:33:27,625 --> 00:33:30,833
and I wanted to have it out
with the old devil.

468
00:33:31,125 --> 00:33:34,708
I went into his study,
and he was sitting at his desk.

469
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,791
Well, at least
that's how it looked.

470
00:33:37,084 --> 00:33:41,666
I've just about had as much
as I'm going to take of you,

471
00:33:41,959 --> 00:33:44,708
you swine.

472
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,749
Do you hear?

473
00:33:48,042 --> 00:33:54,833
Oh, don't like it when someone
stands up to you, do you?

474
00:33:55,125 --> 00:33:57,791
...When someone stands up
to you, do you?

475
00:33:58,084 --> 00:34:00,041
Nothing to say?

476
00:34:02,042 --> 00:34:03,416
Oh.

477
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:05,708
Oh, God.

478
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,624
- So when you found him,

479
00:34:07,917 --> 00:34:10,666
Monsieur Astwell was, in fact,
already dead.

480
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,958
- But why on Earth
did you make a run for it?

481
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:20,291
- Well, when the maid
saw the blood, I...

482
00:34:20,584 --> 00:34:22,208
I just panicked.

483
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:26,208
You see, I knew you wouldn't
believe me.

484
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,958
I mean, who would?

485
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:31,124
- Poirot might.

486
00:34:47,584 --> 00:34:48,624
- You do realize

487
00:34:48,917 --> 00:34:51,749
I can't guarantee any results,
Mr. Poirot.

488
00:34:52,042 --> 00:34:55,124
- I have the most complete faith
in you, Miss Lemon.

489
00:34:58,709 --> 00:35:00,499
- You are sleepy.

490
00:35:00,792 --> 00:35:05,041
Very sleepy.

491
00:35:08,292 --> 00:35:11,708
- Your eyelids are heavy.

492
00:35:14,625 --> 00:35:17,999
They are closing...closing...

493
00:35:18,292 --> 00:35:20,291
- This really is quite absurd.

494
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:23,708
- Relax.

495
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,458
You are going to sleep.

496
00:35:46,459 --> 00:35:49,583
- Lady Astwell,
you are now asleep.

497
00:35:49,875 --> 00:35:54,249
You can hear me,
and you can answer my questions.

498
00:35:54,542 --> 00:35:55,416
- I can hear you.

499
00:35:55,709 --> 00:35:58,333
I can answer your questions.

500
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:04,208
- It is the night of the murder.

501
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:08,624
You are seated
at the dining table.

502
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:12,249
Describe to me what you saw
and what you felt.

503
00:36:12,542 --> 00:36:14,166
- I...

504
00:36:14,459 --> 00:36:17,624
I'm in great distress,

505
00:36:17,917 --> 00:36:19,749
worried about Lily.

506
00:36:20,042 --> 00:36:24,749
Victor's looking at Rueben
in an angry way.

507
00:36:25,042 --> 00:36:27,624
- Tell me about Victor.

508
00:36:27,917 --> 00:36:29,541
- Such a dear man.

509
00:36:30,625 --> 00:36:33,416
We love each other very much.

510
00:36:42,792 --> 00:36:44,958
- It is later in the evening.

511
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:46,333
- We're in business
to make money.

512
00:36:46,625 --> 00:36:49,374
- You go to the study.

513
00:36:49,667 --> 00:36:52,041
Is Victor there?

514
00:36:52,334 --> 00:36:55,583
- No, he's just coming out.

515
00:36:55,875 --> 00:36:58,041
He looks pale and angry.

516
00:36:58,334 --> 00:37:00,833
- He's insufferable.

517
00:37:01,125 --> 00:37:02,749
- You enter the study.

518
00:37:03,042 --> 00:37:04,541
You have a terrible scene
with your husband.

519
00:37:04,834 --> 00:37:06,583
- ...Is going, and that's all
there is to it.

520
00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:07,999
- Don't I have any say
in the matter?

521
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:09,624
- Paid companions
are ten a penny.

522
00:37:09,917 --> 00:37:11,708
You can get another one.

523
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,749
- Very soon,
he will be murdered.

524
00:37:15,042 --> 00:37:18,249
Do you know who murdered
your husband, Lady Astwell?

525
00:37:19,542 --> 00:37:20,749
- It wasn't Charles.

526
00:37:21,042 --> 00:37:22,333
- How do you know?

527
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:23,874
- Because of the curtain.

528
00:37:24,167 --> 00:37:25,291
Don't I have any say
in the matter?

529
00:37:25,584 --> 00:37:27,666
- Paid companions
are ten a penny.

530
00:37:27,959 --> 00:37:29,333
- Curtain?
What about the curtain?

531
00:37:33,375 --> 00:37:34,166
The shape.

532
00:37:34,417 --> 00:37:36,249
- Shape?

533
00:37:36,542 --> 00:37:37,458
- The...

534
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,374
- Is there someone
behind the curtain?

535
00:37:39,667 --> 00:37:40,999
Who is behind the curtain,
Lady Astwell?

536
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:42,958
- Really, Mr. Poirot,
this has gone on long enough.

537
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:44,208
- S'il vous plaît, mademoiselle.

538
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,249
- She's in distress.
Can't you see that?

539
00:37:46,542 --> 00:37:47,791
- Lady Astwell, the curtain.

540
00:37:48,084 --> 00:37:50,708
Is there someone
behind the curtain?

541
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,124
- Oh.

542
00:37:52,417 --> 00:37:54,083
- Oh, it's too late.
She's coming out of it.

543
00:37:56,125 --> 00:37:57,249
- Have I been having a nap?

544
00:37:57,542 --> 00:38:00,458
- That's it, just a little nap.

545
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:02,666
- Did I...

546
00:38:02,959 --> 00:38:06,083
Did I say anything?

547
00:38:06,375 --> 00:38:08,083
- Not as much
as I could have wished.

548
00:38:23,042 --> 00:38:23,958
On the evening of the tragedy,

549
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:25,624
I understand that you had
retired to bed

550
00:38:25,917 --> 00:38:27,333
before Lady Astwell
went to the study,

551
00:38:27,625 --> 00:38:28,791
is that not so?

552
00:38:29,084 --> 00:38:30,499
- Yes.

553
00:38:37,042 --> 00:38:39,958
- Did you, by any chance,
leave your room again?

554
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:41,458
- No.

555
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:47,458
- Did you go into the study
at any time during the evening?

556
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:50,499
- No, not at any time.

557
00:38:53,875 --> 00:38:54,749
- How curious.

558
00:38:55,042 --> 00:38:57,749
- In what way, Mr. Poirot?

559
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,374
- As I recall, that evening

560
00:39:02,667 --> 00:39:06,666
you wore a dress
of green chiffon.

561
00:39:08,875 --> 00:39:11,041
Such a pity it has been torn.

562
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:15,208
Where did you find that?

563
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,249
- Did you go into the study
again after dinner?

564
00:39:17,542 --> 00:39:19,916
- No.
Yes.

565
00:39:20,209 --> 00:39:21,874
I may have.

566
00:39:22,167 --> 00:39:24,041
Yes, I remember now.

567
00:39:24,334 --> 00:39:26,041
I was in the study
the previous evening,

568
00:39:26,334 --> 00:39:29,583
and I was wearing
the same dress.

569
00:39:29,875 --> 00:39:31,499
- Ah, the same dress.

570
00:39:31,792 --> 00:39:32,833
- Hmm.
- Ah.

571
00:39:35,834 --> 00:39:37,666
How sad that you appear
to have spilled onto it

572
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:40,458
some of Sir Rueben's
most excellent wine.

573
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,333
Or is it blood?

574
00:40:01,625 --> 00:40:02,916
- She's making a run for it,
Poirot.

575
00:40:03,209 --> 00:40:05,333
- It must have something to do
with that parcel.

576
00:40:05,625 --> 00:40:06,874
- I think I know
where she's going.

577
00:40:07,167 --> 00:40:09,541
Exhibition Road.
She'll catch the 1:15.

578
00:40:12,834 --> 00:40:14,291
- You are sure of the timetable,
Hastings?

579
00:40:14,584 --> 00:40:15,458
- Absolutely positive.

580
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,124
- Bon, then we have
just the time.

581
00:40:17,417 --> 00:40:19,124
But you must drive
like the winds.

582
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,458
- I'm depending on you
to navigate.

583
00:40:36,959 --> 00:40:38,083
- When's the next train
to London?

584
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:31,624
- Exhibition Road, please.

585
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:57,791
- Where is this Exhibition Road,
Hastings?

586
00:41:58,084 --> 00:41:59,791
- It should be up here
on the right.

587
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:01,666
It's full of museums
and colleges.

588
00:42:01,959 --> 00:42:04,333
- But for us,
only one that matters.

589
00:42:19,584 --> 00:42:21,124
Vite, Hastings.
Vite.

590
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:27,916
A hurried departure,
Mademoiselle Margrave?

591
00:42:28,209 --> 00:42:30,791
If that is indeed your name.

592
00:42:50,917 --> 00:42:55,083
- My real name is Lily Naylor.

593
00:42:55,375 --> 00:42:57,166
Humphrey's my brother.

594
00:42:57,459 --> 00:42:58,791
- And you, Monsieur Naylor,

595
00:42:59,084 --> 00:43:01,458
are a research fellow
here at the Imperial College?

596
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:05,249
- Yes, in polymer chemistry.

597
00:43:05,542 --> 00:43:07,041
The molecular forms
of repeating units--

598
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:09,708
- We are talking
about synthetic rubber.

599
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,624
- In this instance, yes.

600
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,166
I made a breakthrough
with one compound.

601
00:43:18,459 --> 00:43:22,166
It wasn't perfect,
but it was nearly there.

602
00:43:22,459 --> 00:43:25,291
The trouble was that it needed
commercial investment

603
00:43:25,584 --> 00:43:27,666
to develop its potential.

604
00:43:31,834 --> 00:43:34,624
So I approached
Astwell Chemicals.

605
00:43:34,917 --> 00:43:39,124
At first, they showed
some interest in my work.

606
00:43:39,417 --> 00:43:40,583
Then, after a while,

607
00:43:40,875 --> 00:43:43,499
Sir Rueben told me that they had
lost interest entirely.

608
00:43:43,792 --> 00:43:46,249
- Sorry, Naylor, we're not
prepared to go that far.

609
00:43:48,625 --> 00:43:50,708
- I believed them at first.

610
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,541
Then my suspicions
became aroused

611
00:43:53,834 --> 00:43:56,874
by odd little reports
in scientific journals.

612
00:43:57,167 --> 00:43:58,916
They wouldn't have meant much
to anyone

613
00:43:59,209 --> 00:44:00,583
who wasn't expert
in the subject.

614
00:44:00,875 --> 00:44:01,749
Hello, George?

615
00:44:02,042 --> 00:44:03,124
Yes, have you seen
the current issue...

616
00:44:03,417 --> 00:44:05,874
I made certain inquiries
and became convinced

617
00:44:06,167 --> 00:44:09,208
that Astwell's were using
my basic research.

618
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:10,749
He was swindling me.

619
00:44:11,042 --> 00:44:14,791
But...I had no proof.

620
00:44:16,959 --> 00:44:19,791
- And you, Mademoiselle...
Naylor

621
00:44:20,084 --> 00:44:21,666
and your references?

622
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:23,249
They are genuine?

623
00:44:23,542 --> 00:44:26,916
- Oh, yes, completely so.

624
00:44:27,209 --> 00:44:29,958
I was employed
by the Duchess of Perthshire.

625
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:33,083
The Astwells would have
recognized the name Naylor,

626
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:38,041
and so I changed my name
on the references.

627
00:44:45,834 --> 00:44:47,249
- And by this subterfuge,

628
00:44:47,542 --> 00:44:50,124
you were able to obtain
the Astoprene file.

629
00:45:16,417 --> 00:45:17,499
Monsieur Astwell,

630
00:45:17,792 --> 00:45:20,291
would you be so kind as to tell
us about Monsieur Naylor?

631
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:21,833
I understand
you and your brother

632
00:45:22,125 --> 00:45:23,833
stole his research.

633
00:45:24,125 --> 00:45:25,666
- I tried to argue with Rueben,

634
00:45:25,959 --> 00:45:29,041
but he said that Naylor's work
was unproven.

635
00:45:29,334 --> 00:45:30,666
Our labs took over
the whole thing.

636
00:45:30,959 --> 00:45:33,833
- Well, I agree there were some
problems still to be solved--

637
00:45:34,125 --> 00:45:35,166
- Let us, if you please,

638
00:45:35,459 --> 00:45:38,083
go back to the night
of the murder of Sir Rueben.

639
00:45:38,375 --> 00:45:39,999
Lady Astwell,

640
00:45:40,292 --> 00:45:42,166
when you were in the trance
of the hypnotics,

641
00:45:42,459 --> 00:45:44,708
you said that you saw something
behind the curtain.

642
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,374
- Not--not the window curtains.

643
00:45:48,667 --> 00:45:49,708
It was that curtain.

644
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,958
Oh, my God.

645
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,458
- Calm yourself, madame.

646
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:56,291
Captain Hastings.

647
00:45:56,584 --> 00:45:58,124
Thank you.

648
00:45:58,417 --> 00:46:01,208
Perhaps you can tell us who was
hiding behind the curtain,

649
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:02,833
Monsieur Naylor?

650
00:46:03,125 --> 00:46:04,749
- It wasn't me.

651
00:46:06,209 --> 00:46:07,041
I told you,

652
00:46:07,334 --> 00:46:08,791
after I'd met Lily
in the garden,

653
00:46:09,084 --> 00:46:10,624
I went back to my hotel.

654
00:46:13,459 --> 00:46:15,749
- But there was indeed
an intruder.

655
00:46:16,042 --> 00:46:17,791
And on first entering the study,

656
00:46:18,084 --> 00:46:22,624
this intruder had no thought
of murder.

657
00:46:22,917 --> 00:46:26,541
It was solely for the purpose
of making the search.

658
00:46:28,334 --> 00:46:29,708
But suddenly...

659
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:30,874
- All I'm saying...

660
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:32,458
- There was the sound
of approaching voices

661
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:34,624
and footsteps.

662
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:38,833
And there was to be found
only one place to hide,

663
00:46:39,125 --> 00:46:41,041
the small bedroom
attached to the study

664
00:46:41,334 --> 00:46:44,124
that Monsieur Astwell uses
when he works late at night.

665
00:46:44,417 --> 00:46:46,541
- I don't want to hear any more
of this sentimental...

666
00:46:46,834 --> 00:46:49,874
- Monsieur Victor Astwell and
Sir Rueben enter the study.

667
00:46:50,167 --> 00:46:52,499
They do not see anybody
hiding behind the curtain,

668
00:46:52,792 --> 00:46:54,249
and the two men quarrel
violently.

669
00:46:54,542 --> 00:46:58,291
- What we are selling them will
be used for military purposes.

670
00:46:58,584 --> 00:46:59,666
- Victor.

671
00:47:01,875 --> 00:47:06,208
- Monsieur Victor Astwell
leaves in anger.

672
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:10,333
But for our intruder,
there's no way to escape.

673
00:47:10,625 --> 00:47:12,249
What a dilemma.

674
00:47:12,542 --> 00:47:14,833
If Sir Rueben decides to spend
the night in the little bedroom,

675
00:47:15,125 --> 00:47:18,583
discovery must surely follow.

676
00:47:18,875 --> 00:47:20,291
Lady Astwell enters the study

677
00:47:20,584 --> 00:47:22,916
to protest at the dismissal
of Mademoiselle Naylor.

678
00:47:23,209 --> 00:47:23,999
- That's all there is to it.

679
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:25,124
- Well, don't I have any say--

680
00:47:25,417 --> 00:47:26,791
- Paid companions
are ten a penny.

681
00:47:27,084 --> 00:47:28,499
You can get another one.

682
00:47:28,792 --> 00:47:34,541
- When Lady Astwell leaves,
Sir Rueben, he is alone.

683
00:47:34,834 --> 00:47:35,791
Now is the only moment

684
00:47:36,084 --> 00:47:39,958
for our intruder to escape
without detection.

685
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:43,374
But Sir Rueben hears a noise.

686
00:47:43,667 --> 00:47:45,708
- What the...

687
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:46,791
- Et voilà.

688
00:47:48,709 --> 00:47:52,624
- An act of impulse
followed by blind panic.

689
00:47:52,917 --> 00:47:56,624
Now our intruder must escape.

690
00:47:56,917 --> 00:47:57,916
But it is not to be.

691
00:47:58,209 --> 00:48:01,916
Is there no way out
of this accursed room?

692
00:48:02,209 --> 00:48:04,333
Monsieur Charles Leverson
enters the study.

693
00:48:04,625 --> 00:48:07,916
- ...When someone
stands up to you, do you?

694
00:48:08,209 --> 00:48:11,249
Nothing to say?

695
00:48:11,542 --> 00:48:15,166
- And on seeing that Sir Rueben
is dead, he leaves.

696
00:48:15,459 --> 00:48:18,583
Then Mademoiselle Naylor
enters the study,

697
00:48:18,875 --> 00:48:21,749
and finding the body
of Sir Rueben,

698
00:48:22,042 --> 00:48:23,249
seizes her opportunity

699
00:48:23,542 --> 00:48:26,916
to take a file that is
so important to her brother.

700
00:48:31,584 --> 00:48:32,749
- Lily's told you what happened.

701
00:48:33,042 --> 00:48:33,916
He was trying to cheat me.

702
00:48:34,209 --> 00:48:35,749
But she didn't murder him.

703
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,374
- Mesdames et messieurs,

704
00:48:42,667 --> 00:48:44,874
I am a student
of the psychology,

705
00:48:45,167 --> 00:48:46,583
and throughout this case,

706
00:48:46,875 --> 00:48:49,291
I have been looking
not for a man or woman

707
00:48:49,584 --> 00:48:50,624
who has the bad temper,

708
00:48:50,917 --> 00:48:53,916
because the bad temper is,
in itself, a safety valve.

709
00:48:54,209 --> 00:48:58,499
No, I have been looking
for a person

710
00:48:58,792 --> 00:49:01,666
who has the patience,

711
00:49:01,959 --> 00:49:05,499
who has for too long played
the part of the underdog,

712
00:49:05,792 --> 00:49:08,208
who crept into the study
of Sir Rueben,

713
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,291
who hid behind the curtain,

714
00:49:10,584 --> 00:49:13,583
who became trapped

715
00:49:13,875 --> 00:49:15,749
and finally committed
the act of violence

716
00:49:16,042 --> 00:49:18,291
that had been harbored
for so long.

717
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:23,958
It was you who was hiding
behind the curtain.

718
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:27,833
It was you who murdered
Sir Rueben Astwell,

719
00:49:28,125 --> 00:49:30,208
Monsieur Trefusis.

720
00:49:32,292 --> 00:49:34,541
You waited until the house
was silent and empty.

721
00:49:34,834 --> 00:49:37,041
You then crept back
to your bedroom,

722
00:49:37,334 --> 00:49:39,416
leaving a dead man on the floor.

723
00:49:42,084 --> 00:49:43,833
- This is absolute nonsense.

724
00:49:46,792 --> 00:49:49,208
Why should I want to kill him?

725
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:52,083
- In the Astoprene file,

726
00:49:52,375 --> 00:49:56,499
I noticed a contract that bears
your signature.

727
00:50:02,334 --> 00:50:04,166
It would appear
that you were instrumental

728
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:05,624
in the development
of the invention

729
00:50:05,917 --> 00:50:08,541
by Monsieur Naylor.

730
00:50:08,834 --> 00:50:11,374
You were to become
a very rich man,

731
00:50:11,667 --> 00:50:14,291
if it was produced
by the Astwell Company.

732
00:50:14,584 --> 00:50:17,499
But if the process
was to be licensed elsewhere,

733
00:50:17,792 --> 00:50:21,708
as it was told to you
by your German colleagues,

734
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,791
of what value then would be
your contract?

735
00:50:31,709 --> 00:50:33,583
- Of no value at all.

736
00:50:39,542 --> 00:50:47,583
- He was a bully, a liar,
and a swindler.

737
00:50:47,875 --> 00:50:50,249
- I think there will be
few people who would disagree

738
00:50:50,542 --> 00:50:53,541
with your analysis
of the character of Sir Rueben.

739
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,874
So tell me, Mademoiselle Naylor,

740
00:51:03,167 --> 00:51:05,124
your brother, he is happy
with the terms offered

741
00:51:05,417 --> 00:51:06,708
by Monsieur Victor Astwell?

742
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,833
- Well, they really are
quite generous.

743
00:51:09,125 --> 00:51:10,708
- Shh-shh-shh.

744
00:51:19,042 --> 00:51:20,249
- Captain Hastings?

745
00:51:20,542 --> 00:51:23,041
A hole in one, Captain Hastings.

746
00:51:23,334 --> 00:51:24,791
A hole in one.

747
00:51:25,084 --> 00:51:26,583
- Miss Lemon, Captain Hastings

748
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:28,958
possesses far too much
of the intellectual strength--

749
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:31,333
- Quite right, Poirot.

750
00:51:55,584 --> 00:51:58,166
I say.
