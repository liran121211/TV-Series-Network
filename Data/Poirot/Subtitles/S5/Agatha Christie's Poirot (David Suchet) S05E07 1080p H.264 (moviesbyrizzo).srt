1
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:20,374
- Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:01:20,667 --> 00:01:22,916
lot 22:

3
00:01:23,209 --> 00:01:26,166
an Edgar Brandt
wrought-iron wall mirror

4
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:28,208
and console table.

5
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,583
I shall open the bidding
at £30.

6
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:36,791
Do I see £30?

7
00:01:37,084 --> 00:01:37,916
£30.

8
00:01:38,209 --> 00:01:39,333
- Is this what you came for,
Poirot?

9
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:40,499
- Yes, it is, Hastings.

10
00:01:40,792 --> 00:01:42,624
I thought for the vestibule,
you know, by the door.

11
00:01:42,917 --> 00:01:43,833
- £40.

12
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:45,124
- How high will you go?

13
00:01:45,417 --> 00:01:46,458
- £90.

14
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:47,749
- £50.
- It will be enough.

15
00:01:48,042 --> 00:01:49,541
- Thank you.

16
00:01:49,834 --> 00:01:51,124
- £60.

17
00:01:51,417 --> 00:01:54,458
And £70.

18
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:57,791
- Here.

19
00:01:58,084 --> 00:02:00,166
- £80.
Thank you, madam.

20
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:03,333
£90.

21
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:06,208
At £90, then.

22
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,749
At £90.

23
00:02:09,042 --> 00:02:10,874
Any more?

24
00:02:11,167 --> 00:02:12,166
- £100.

25
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:21,958
- It's with you, sir.

26
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:27,541
- £120.

27
00:02:36,584 --> 00:02:38,166
- Sir?

28
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:44,041
At £120, then.

29
00:02:44,334 --> 00:02:46,208
Any more?

30
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,208
Sold to Mr. Chevenix.

31
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:53,333
- Well, that was a bit
of bad luck, Poirot.

32
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:54,541
I thought you had it there.

33
00:02:54,834 --> 00:02:55,791
- So, Hastings, did I.

34
00:02:56,084 --> 00:02:57,249
- Mr. Poirot.

35
00:02:57,542 --> 00:02:59,624
You are Hercule Poirot,
are you not,

36
00:02:59,917 --> 00:03:01,124
the detective?

37
00:03:01,417 --> 00:03:02,291
- Yes.

38
00:03:02,584 --> 00:03:04,583
- No hard feelings, I hope?

39
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:05,999
- Non.

40
00:03:06,292 --> 00:03:08,791
- Good. My card.

41
00:03:09,084 --> 00:03:12,833
Tell me, what do you know
about modern art, Mr. Poirot?

42
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:13,916
I'm a collector.

43
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:16,041
Also I deal in paintings
and sculptures.

44
00:03:16,334 --> 00:03:17,166
That's my business.

45
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:18,916
And I have to tell you,

46
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:21,749
I'm not a man
who's easily fooled.

47
00:03:22,042 --> 00:03:23,583
- That is self-evident,
monsieur.

48
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:25,041
- So it may surprise you
to learn

49
00:03:25,334 --> 00:03:27,041
that I believe
I'm being defrauded.

50
00:03:27,334 --> 00:03:29,208
I want you
to look into it.

51
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,916
- The services of Hercule Poirot
are not inexpensive.

52
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:33,333
- Maybe I'll give you
the mirror.

53
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:34,666
What do you say?

54
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,291
I've got a place,
Hamborough Close,

55
00:03:36,584 --> 00:03:37,624
near Whimperley.

56
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:39,291
How about tomorrow?

57
00:03:39,584 --> 00:03:41,083
- That is out of the question.

58
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:42,291
- The day after, then.

59
00:03:42,584 --> 00:03:43,666
Let me know.

60
00:03:45,417 --> 00:03:47,541
- Well, that was a bit
of a cheek, wasn't it?

61
00:03:47,834 --> 00:03:49,624
- Yes, indeed, Hastings.

62
00:03:49,917 --> 00:03:54,208
This Gervase Chevenix,

63
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,624
it does not occur to him

64
00:03:55,917 --> 00:03:57,958
that Poirot is also
a man of importance,

65
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,624
a man of affairs?

66
00:04:00,917 --> 00:04:03,708
And yet he summons me like
a mere nobody, an obedient dog.

67
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,666
- Oh, I take it you'll refuse.

68
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:08,791
- To refuse, yes,
it is my first instinct.

69
00:04:09,084 --> 00:04:10,124
But, you know, Hastings,

70
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:13,749
a man with so much arrogance
as this...

71
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,124
Even he may be vulnerable
in ways he cannot see.

72
00:04:18,417 --> 00:04:21,291
- And he did offer you
that mirror.

73
00:04:21,584 --> 00:04:22,749
- That too.

74
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,208
- I'll get the tickets
tomorrow.

75
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,624
- And do you take this man

76
00:04:30,917 --> 00:04:32,708
to be
your lawfully wedded husband?

77
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:35,874
- I do.

78
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:37,666
- Well, there we are, then.

79
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:41,041
Now, let me see.

80
00:04:41,334 --> 00:04:42,541
Do you have a ring?

81
00:04:42,834 --> 00:04:44,291
- Yes.

82
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:47,624
- That's right.

83
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:52,166
John Lake, Ruth Chevenix,

84
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:56,083
I am pleased to declare you
man and wife.

85
00:05:01,792 --> 00:05:04,999
- I wish it didn't have
to be like this.

86
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:15,458
- I do love you.

87
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:36,583
- Merci.

88
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,749
- Mr. Poirot?
- Oui?

89
00:05:47,042 --> 00:05:48,499
- My name's Susan Cardwell.

90
00:05:48,792 --> 00:05:50,416
Do you mind if I join you?

91
00:05:50,709 --> 00:05:51,791
- Not at all, mademoiselle.

92
00:05:52,084 --> 00:05:54,166
Asseyez-vous,
s'il vous plaît.

93
00:05:57,834 --> 00:05:59,458
This is my associate,
Captain Hastings.

94
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,541
How do you do?

95
00:06:00,792 --> 00:06:01,999
- May I offer you
a cup of coffee?

96
00:06:02,292 --> 00:06:04,333
- Oh, I won't, thank you.

97
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:07,291
My fiancé, Hugo,
told me to look out for you.

98
00:06:07,584 --> 00:06:09,416
Actually, he's not my fiancé,

99
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:10,833
not officially, anyway.

100
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,041
- Hugo?

101
00:06:12,334 --> 00:06:13,374
- Oh, Hugo Trent,

102
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:14,541
Gervase's nephew.

103
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:15,791
He's meeting you at the station,

104
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,541
so he suggested
I come on the same train.

105
00:06:18,834 --> 00:06:20,749
- Are you staying
with Monsieur Chevenix?

106
00:06:21,042 --> 00:06:23,416
- Unfortunately, yes.

107
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:24,833
Well, I've only met him once,

108
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:28,708
and he was
absolutely horrible to me.

109
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,749
- He doesn't approve of you?

110
00:06:31,042 --> 00:06:32,916
- It's not that.
It's just--

111
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:35,916
Well, it's--
it's Hugo and me.

112
00:06:36,209 --> 00:06:37,791
You see, Gervase
has always had his heart set

113
00:06:38,084 --> 00:06:39,749
on Hugo marrying
his daughter, Ruth.

114
00:06:40,042 --> 00:06:42,208
- But he's not inclined
to do that.

115
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,958
- No.

116
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,791
But you see,
Ruth was adopted.

117
00:06:46,084 --> 00:06:48,499
I suppose Gervase thinks
marrying her to his nephew

118
00:06:48,792 --> 00:06:52,916
will--will make her
more completely his.

119
00:06:53,209 --> 00:06:55,083
- But he can't force them
to marry, can he?

120
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:56,624
- He can try.

121
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,499
He will try.

122
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:00,083
I think he enjoys it--

123
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:02,666
manipulating other people.

124
00:07:05,417 --> 00:07:06,749
I really hate him, you know.

125
00:07:07,042 --> 00:07:08,249
I do.

126
00:07:08,542 --> 00:07:11,416
And I'm not going to let him
spoil my life.

127
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,791
Here's Hugo.

128
00:07:25,084 --> 00:07:26,291
- Susan.

129
00:07:26,584 --> 00:07:27,916
Darling.
- Mwah.

130
00:07:28,209 --> 00:07:29,666
- You must be Mr. Poirot.

131
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:30,749
- Monsieur.

132
00:07:31,042 --> 00:07:32,541
- And...
- Arthur Hastings.

133
00:07:32,834 --> 00:07:34,291
- Hugo Trent.

134
00:07:34,584 --> 00:07:37,124
Look, I'm supposed to be
driving you to Hamborough Close.

135
00:07:37,417 --> 00:07:39,291
But I've got to stop off
at my studio.

136
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:40,499
Do you mind terribly?

137
00:07:40,792 --> 00:07:41,958
- Not at all.
- It's on the way.

138
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,333
- Bon.

139
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:49,083
- And these are my designs,

140
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:50,916
all of them.

141
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:54,333
What we're doing here
is revolutionary, Mr. Poirot.

142
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,416
What do you think?

143
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:59,416
- I think
it is most remarkable.

144
00:07:59,709 --> 00:08:00,999
- Is it all metal?

145
00:08:01,292 --> 00:08:02,374
- Tubular steel.

146
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:04,916
You see, who needs wood,
Captain Hastings?

147
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:07,583
Wood expands. It perishes.
It dries out.

148
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:10,499
But metal, metal is perfect.

149
00:08:10,792 --> 00:08:13,124
You see, triangulated joinery.

150
00:08:13,417 --> 00:08:14,291
There's no fuss.

151
00:08:14,584 --> 00:08:15,833
- Oh, yes, I see.

152
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,124
- Hugo.
- Give me a minute, Lawrence.

153
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,583
Look at this.

154
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:24,124
Sit down.

155
00:08:35,167 --> 00:08:36,124
What do you think?

156
00:08:36,417 --> 00:08:39,208
- I think...

157
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,374
that it is perfectly conceived.

158
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:44,624
- This is the future,
Mr. Poirot.

159
00:08:44,917 --> 00:08:46,999
And I could sell thousands,
if only--

160
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:49,208
- Uncle Gervase.

161
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,249
- He does not support
this enterprise?

162
00:08:51,542 --> 00:08:54,124
- Just getting this far
has been a struggle.

163
00:08:54,417 --> 00:08:55,708
Now the banks are closing in,

164
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,416
and I may have to sell
my designs

165
00:08:57,709 --> 00:08:58,541
just to pay them off.

166
00:08:58,834 --> 00:08:59,666
- Hugo.

167
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:01,624
They telephoned
while you were out.

168
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:03,499
They won't give you
any more time.

169
00:09:03,792 --> 00:09:05,541
- I'll have to speak to them.

170
00:09:05,834 --> 00:09:08,166
Excuse me, Mr. Poirot.

171
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:11,291
Lawrence will have
to drive you.

172
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:13,833
Damn it to hell.

173
00:09:40,459 --> 00:09:43,124
- Mm.
Quite a place.

174
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:44,458
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.

175
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,083
Mr. Chevenix
is waiting for you.

176
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:47,499
- Merci.

177
00:09:47,792 --> 00:09:49,249
- Enter!

178
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:53,708
- Monsieur Poirot, sir.

179
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,666
- Oh, Mr. Poirot.

180
00:09:55,959 --> 00:09:57,749
Good of you to come.

181
00:09:58,042 --> 00:10:00,708
You've brought your secretary.

182
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,249
- This is my associate,
Captain Hastings.

183
00:10:04,542 --> 00:10:05,374
- Oh, yes.

184
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:07,291
I saw him at the auction.

185
00:10:07,584 --> 00:10:08,958
Well, what do you think?

186
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,124
Hung it this morning.

187
00:10:10,417 --> 00:10:12,208
Looks good, doesn't it?

188
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,249
- Yes, indeed.

189
00:10:14,542 --> 00:10:16,749
- Shall I come back later,
Mr. Chevenix?

190
00:10:17,042 --> 00:10:17,916
- Yes.

191
00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:20,666
You can sort out
that stuff on Matisse.

192
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,999
This is Miss Lingard,
my research assistant.

193
00:10:24,292 --> 00:10:25,333
- How do you do?

194
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,541
- Mademoiselle Lingard.

195
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:29,041
- We're working
on a study of fauvism

196
00:10:29,334 --> 00:10:31,999
for the British Museum
of Modern Art.

197
00:10:32,292 --> 00:10:33,999
Oh, Miss Lingard,

198
00:10:34,292 --> 00:10:36,499
is that architect here?

199
00:10:36,792 --> 00:10:38,666
- I believe so,
Mr. Chevenix.

200
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,083
- Have him come in,
will you?

201
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:45,583
£10,000, Mr. Poirot--

202
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,583
not a drop in the ocean.

203
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:50,749
That's how much I've paid him,
John Lake.

204
00:10:51,042 --> 00:10:53,208
- And this is the fraud
you wish me to investigate?

205
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,874
- Yes.

206
00:10:55,167 --> 00:10:56,999
- For what purpose
did you give him the money?

207
00:10:57,292 --> 00:10:59,208
- A big development
in London:

208
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,624
shops, offices, apartments.

209
00:11:01,917 --> 00:11:04,791
He's building it,
and he's gotten me to invest.

210
00:11:05,084 --> 00:11:07,416
So far, he hasn't even
laid a brick.

211
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:09,333
And I'm beginning to wonder
if he ever will.

212
00:11:13,209 --> 00:11:14,583
- You wanted to see me,
Gervase?

213
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,166
- Come in, Lake.

214
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:18,333
There's someone
I want you to meet.

215
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:21,874
This is Hercule Poirot.

216
00:11:22,167 --> 00:11:23,624
- The detective.

217
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:26,208
- Yes.

218
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,499
Why don't you take Mr. Poirot
into the garden

219
00:11:28,792 --> 00:11:30,458
and get him some tea?

220
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,749
I'll see you at dinner.

221
00:11:32,042 --> 00:11:33,499
We'll eat in the hall,
quarter past 8:00.

222
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:35,583
Do try not to be late.

223
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:38,833
Snell rings the first gong
at eight minutes past the hour

224
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,583
and the second at 8:15.

225
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,666
I'll see you then.

226
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,791
- Gentlemen.

227
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:56,749
I--I don't suppose--

228
00:11:57,042 --> 00:11:59,208
You're not here on business,
Mr. Poirot.

229
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,583
- That is precisely
why I am here, Monsieur Lake.

230
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:02,999
- Oh.

231
00:12:03,292 --> 00:12:04,583
That's typical of Gervase.

232
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:07,958
He likes to spring
his surprises.

233
00:12:13,542 --> 00:12:15,083
Let me introduce you.

234
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,166
This is Mrs. Vanda Chevenix.

235
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:18,999
Hercule Poirot,
Captain Hastings.

236
00:12:19,292 --> 00:12:21,249
- Madame.
- How do you do?

237
00:12:21,542 --> 00:12:24,124
- And her daughter,
Miss Chevenix.

238
00:12:24,417 --> 00:12:26,208
- Ruth.

239
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,999
- Mademoiselle.
- Hello.

240
00:12:28,292 --> 00:12:30,291
- Hello.

241
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:33,833
- Apparently, Mr. Poirot is
doing some work for your father.

242
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,166
- For Gervase?

243
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:36,333
Really?

244
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:37,583
- Oui.

245
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,666
- It is about the death.

246
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,416
- What death,
Madame Chevenix?

247
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:47,458
- Safra warned me
there would be a death.

248
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,749
She told me
not to be afraid.

249
00:12:50,042 --> 00:12:52,208
- Who's Safra?

250
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,833
- She was a servant
of Amenhotep.

251
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,208
She is my spiritual guide.

252
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,999
- Oh, come on, Vanda.

253
00:13:00,292 --> 00:13:02,874
I'm sure Mr. Poirot doesn't want
to hear about all that.

254
00:13:03,167 --> 00:13:05,041
- Au contraire, mademoiselle.

255
00:13:05,334 --> 00:13:09,124
Poirot interests himself always
in matters of the occult.

256
00:13:11,417 --> 00:13:13,749
You permit?

257
00:13:14,042 --> 00:13:15,416
Merci.

258
00:13:26,209 --> 00:13:27,583
It is very old.

259
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:32,166
- It is 3,000 years old.

260
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:33,458
It was hers.

261
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:37,124
- This belonged to Safra?

262
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:39,874
- She is never wrong.

263
00:13:40,167 --> 00:13:41,333
- I...

264
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:43,416
I think I'd better be going.

265
00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:45,374
- I'll walk round with you.

266
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:46,749
Excuse me.

267
00:13:47,042 --> 00:13:48,083
- Right.

268
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:51,124
- Tea?

269
00:14:11,042 --> 00:14:11,999
- Evening, Hugo.

270
00:14:12,292 --> 00:14:13,458
- Where are you going, Ruth?

271
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,791
- I dropped my brooch somewhere.

272
00:14:15,084 --> 00:14:15,916
Outside, I think.

273
00:14:16,209 --> 00:14:17,333
- Oh.

274
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:18,749
- Have you spoken to Gervase?

275
00:14:19,042 --> 00:14:19,833
- Yes.

276
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,833
He's impossible.

277
00:14:50,917 --> 00:14:52,416
- Entrez.

278
00:14:54,167 --> 00:14:55,958
- Oh, you're not ready yet.

279
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,999
- Well, we have plenty of time,
mon ami.

280
00:14:58,292 --> 00:14:59,166
- Are you sure?

281
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:01,874
I could have sworn
I heard the first gong.

282
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:04,541
- Non.
Let me see.

283
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:13,083
Non, it is
six minutes past 8:00 only.

284
00:16:03,334 --> 00:16:05,208
- What was that?
- I do not know.

285
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,416
- It was a gunshot.

286
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:20,499
- Good evening, Miss Ruth.

287
00:16:20,792 --> 00:16:23,374
- Oh, good evening,
Miss Lingard.

288
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,333
Is something the matter?

289
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:32,833
- I'm not late, am I?

290
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,333
- Did you hear it, Susan?
- What?

291
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:35,833
- I thought I heard a shot.

292
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:36,999
- Just now?

293
00:16:37,292 --> 00:16:39,166
I thought it was
a car backfiring.

294
00:16:39,459 --> 00:16:40,249
- Ruth.

295
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,499
- What's going on?

296
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,874
- We thought we heard
a gun going off.

297
00:16:44,167 --> 00:16:45,624
- Oh, yes, I thought
I heard something.

298
00:16:45,917 --> 00:16:48,291
- It came from upstairs.

299
00:16:48,584 --> 00:16:49,499
- No, it was a car.

300
00:16:49,792 --> 00:16:50,583
It came from over there.

301
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:51,874
- I heard it too.

302
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:53,333
- Snell?

303
00:16:55,417 --> 00:16:56,416
- Yes, ma'am.

304
00:16:56,709 --> 00:16:58,541
- It is 8:15.

305
00:16:58,834 --> 00:17:00,208
Time for the second gong.

306
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,041
- Yes, ma'am.

307
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:05,749
- But where
is Monsieur Chevenix?

308
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:07,958
- He is never late.

309
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,374
- He was working in the study,
ma'am.

310
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,249
- This door must be broken open
immediately.

311
00:17:27,542 --> 00:17:29,166
- Here, let me.

312
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:56,791
- Poirot.

313
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:08,166
- I told you,
Safra is never wrong.

314
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:42,916
- Evening, Poirot.

315
00:18:43,209 --> 00:18:44,499
- Chief Inspector Japp.

316
00:18:44,792 --> 00:18:45,999
- Right, where's the body?

317
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,999
- This way, Chief Inspector.

318
00:18:55,792 --> 00:18:57,583
Chief Inspector.

319
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:16,458
- Suicide.

320
00:19:16,709 --> 00:19:18,083
- So it would appear.

321
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:19,624
- I'd say it was obvious.

322
00:19:19,917 --> 00:19:21,583
The bullet must have gone
straight through his head

323
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,083
and hit the mirror.

324
00:19:25,084 --> 00:19:27,124
- So it would appear.

325
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,958
- He left a note.

326
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,916
"Sorry."

327
00:19:40,209 --> 00:19:42,624
I suppose that says it all.

328
00:19:42,917 --> 00:19:43,749
- Hmm.

329
00:19:44,042 --> 00:19:45,958
Look at this,
Chief Inspector.

330
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,666
- What is it?

331
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,708
- It is a small fragment
of the looking glass.

332
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,958
- Well, there must be splinters
all over the place.

333
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,374
Who found the body?

334
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:00,583
- We did.

335
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,499
We heard a shot
at about ten past 8:00,

336
00:20:02,792 --> 00:20:04,583
and then we broke in the door.

337
00:20:15,959 --> 00:20:17,708
- Let me see.

338
00:20:20,834 --> 00:20:21,624
Ah.

339
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,291
Just as I thought.

340
00:20:23,584 --> 00:20:25,083
He locked himself in.

341
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:27,333
That more or less wraps it up.

342
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,374
- You believe so?

343
00:20:29,667 --> 00:20:31,708
- Well, we've got a dead man.

344
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,749
You heard a shot,
he's alone in the room,

345
00:20:34,042 --> 00:20:35,791
the gun's in his hand,
and the door was locked.

346
00:20:36,084 --> 00:20:37,541
- Well, what about the windows?

347
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:45,916
- Fastened.

348
00:20:46,209 --> 00:20:48,166
- And this one.

349
00:20:53,584 --> 00:20:55,041
- This one too.

350
00:20:55,334 --> 00:20:56,333
Right.

351
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:57,583
Well, I'd better go
and have a word

352
00:20:57,875 --> 00:20:59,208
with Mrs. Chevenix,

353
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,833
not that there's much to say.

354
00:21:06,542 --> 00:21:09,333
You know, it does look
like suicide, Poirot.

355
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:12,124
- Oui, c'est possible,
mon ami.

356
00:21:12,417 --> 00:21:14,416
And yet...

357
00:21:14,709 --> 00:21:16,999
there are many things
I wish to know.

358
00:21:26,334 --> 00:21:28,458
For example,

359
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,249
why was the mirror broken?

360
00:21:30,542 --> 00:21:31,999
And why was there mud
on the shoes

361
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:34,541
belonging
to Mademoiselle Ruth Chevenix?

362
00:21:36,042 --> 00:21:37,749
Voilà.

363
00:21:38,042 --> 00:21:39,291
- Footprints.

364
00:21:39,584 --> 00:21:41,374
- Yes, Hastings, they are
the footprints of a lady

365
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:43,791
and directly outside the study
of Monsieur Chevenix.

366
00:21:44,084 --> 00:21:46,416
- But the French window
was locked from the inside.

367
00:21:46,709 --> 00:21:47,624
- But this window, Hastings,

368
00:21:47,917 --> 00:21:49,208
it can be locked
from the outside.

369
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,541
Regarde.

370
00:21:53,167 --> 00:21:57,291
By raising the metal catch so

371
00:21:57,584 --> 00:21:59,374
and then, with a push...

372
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:06,833
- Good Lord.

373
00:22:09,292 --> 00:22:11,624
- You know, Chief Inspector,

374
00:22:11,917 --> 00:22:15,999
life is one
of the great illusions.

375
00:22:17,459 --> 00:22:20,624
- I'm afraid I don't quite agree
with that, Mrs. Chevenix.

376
00:22:20,917 --> 00:22:23,666
- Gervase knew that.

377
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:25,874
He and I, you see,

378
00:22:26,167 --> 00:22:29,124
we met on the same plane.

379
00:22:29,417 --> 00:22:31,333
- On holiday?

380
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:34,874
- The spiritual plane.

381
00:22:35,167 --> 00:22:38,124
He was one of the great ones.

382
00:22:38,417 --> 00:22:40,666
He, too, found it hard
to conform

383
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:44,124
to the silly standards
of the everyday world.

384
00:22:47,167 --> 00:22:50,166
And he believed me

385
00:22:50,459 --> 00:22:52,458
about the death.

386
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,166
- You'd been told
about his death?

387
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:59,166
- Oh, yes.

388
00:23:01,084 --> 00:23:03,291
Safra told me.

389
00:23:03,584 --> 00:23:05,458
She knew.

390
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,458
- Did she, indeed?

391
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,708
Mrs. Chevenix,
can you tell me

392
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,749
where I might be able
to get hold of this Safra?

393
00:23:15,834 --> 00:23:18,874
- She used to live in Egypt.

394
00:23:19,167 --> 00:23:21,666
- But she moved?

395
00:23:21,959 --> 00:23:23,208
- No.

396
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,666
- Perfectly conceived.

397
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,541
- Oh, hello, Mr. Poirot.

398
00:23:27,834 --> 00:23:29,291
- Oh, Mr. Poirot.

399
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:32,583
- Monsieur Trent...

400
00:23:35,084 --> 00:23:38,083
Did you see your uncle
earlier this evening?

401
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,749
- Yes.

402
00:23:40,042 --> 00:23:41,916
It must have been about 7:00.

403
00:23:42,209 --> 00:23:43,791
He was dressed for dinner.

404
00:23:44,084 --> 00:23:45,249
I--I went to see him

405
00:23:45,542 --> 00:23:46,958
to ask him to help me
with my business.

406
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,541
But he wouldn't listen.

407
00:23:49,834 --> 00:23:51,791
- He wanted Hugo
to marry Ruth.

408
00:23:52,084 --> 00:23:54,208
- No marriage to Ruth,
no money for me.

409
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,291
That's what it boiled down to.

410
00:23:56,584 --> 00:23:58,124
- So, Monsieur Trent,

411
00:23:58,417 --> 00:24:02,041
you had no reason, therefore,
to celebrate.

412
00:24:02,334 --> 00:24:03,291
- None at all.

413
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,458
- It was not you, then,

414
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,166
that opened this bottle
of champagne?

415
00:24:06,459 --> 00:24:07,958
- No.

416
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,416
- Curious.

417
00:24:09,709 --> 00:24:11,291
The bottle of champagne,
it is opened,

418
00:24:11,584 --> 00:24:13,708
and yet the contents
are not consumed.

419
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,083
- Ah, there you are, Poirot.

420
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:26,624
You got any idea where I can
get hold of this Safra,

421
00:24:26,917 --> 00:24:28,541
some sort of friend
of Mrs. Chevenix?

422
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:30,791
- Safra's dead.

423
00:24:31,084 --> 00:24:33,374
She's Vanda's spirit guide.

424
00:24:35,042 --> 00:24:36,708
- Ah.

425
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,249
I might as well be off, then.

426
00:24:38,542 --> 00:24:40,833
- You believe there is nothing
to investigate?

427
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:43,166
- Gervase Chevenix
shot himself.

428
00:24:43,459 --> 00:24:44,874
I'm sure of it.

429
00:24:45,167 --> 00:24:47,166
- In that event,
Chief Inspector, d'accord.

430
00:24:47,459 --> 00:24:49,541
We will return at once
to London.

431
00:24:49,834 --> 00:24:52,333
There are, perhaps,
two questions

432
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:55,666
that you might be able
to answer for me.

433
00:24:55,959 --> 00:24:58,249
- Oh, yes.

434
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,333
- First question:

435
00:25:03,625 --> 00:25:06,874
was Monsieur Chevenix
right-handed or left-handed?

436
00:25:08,792 --> 00:25:10,749
- What's the other question?

437
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:12,458
- It is more simple.

438
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:17,541
If Monsieur Chevenix
shot himself,

439
00:25:17,834 --> 00:25:21,624
what has happened
to the bullet?

440
00:25:40,584 --> 00:25:41,874
- Oh, hello, Miss Chevenix.

441
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:43,208
- Could I see Mr. Poirot,
please?

442
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,124
- Yes.
Follow me down this way.

443
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,291
Miss Chevenix is here.

444
00:25:48,584 --> 00:25:49,458
- Ah, mademoiselle.

445
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,624
- Mr. Poirot,
I need to see you.

446
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:53,999
- Please to sit down,
mademoiselle.

447
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:57,624
- Is it true
that Gervase hired you

448
00:25:57,917 --> 00:26:00,291
to investigate John Lake?

449
00:26:01,792 --> 00:26:03,083
- Oui, mademoiselle.

450
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:04,874
Monsieur Chevenix believed

451
00:26:05,167 --> 00:26:06,666
that he was the object
of a fraud.

452
00:26:06,959 --> 00:26:09,291
- Well, I've come to tell you
that the case is over.

453
00:26:09,584 --> 00:26:11,749
I don't know
what he offered to pay you,

454
00:26:12,042 --> 00:26:14,166
but I hope
that will cover it.

455
00:26:18,417 --> 00:26:19,749
- Mademoiselle,

456
00:26:20,042 --> 00:26:25,874
the company
of Monsieur John Lake,

457
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,708
what is it called?

458
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,916
- It's Northgate Development.

459
00:26:30,209 --> 00:26:32,999
But I'm telling you, Mr. Poirot,
there is nothing to investigate.

460
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:35,708
- May I ask, mademoiselle...

461
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:39,916
Were you close
to your guardian?

462
00:26:42,792 --> 00:26:45,999
I was grateful to Gervase.

463
00:26:46,292 --> 00:26:48,791
And he wasn't just my guardian.

464
00:26:49,084 --> 00:26:50,666
He was actually my uncle.

465
00:26:50,959 --> 00:26:52,916
- But he adopted you.

466
00:26:53,209 --> 00:26:57,999
- I was what is quaintly called
a love child.

467
00:26:58,292 --> 00:26:59,916
My father
was Gervase's younger brother.

468
00:27:00,209 --> 00:27:01,416
He was killed in the war.

469
00:27:01,709 --> 00:27:04,333
And my mother was a typist.

470
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:05,999
- Ah.

471
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:07,916
And where is she now?

472
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:09,458
- I don't know.

473
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:12,624
When my father died,
she wrote to Gervase.

474
00:27:12,917 --> 00:27:14,333
He couldn't have
any children of his own,

475
00:27:14,625 --> 00:27:15,416
so he adopted me.

476
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:16,583
- I see.

477
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:19,291
Please to sit down,
mademoiselle.

478
00:27:25,084 --> 00:27:27,916
Tell me, mademoiselle,

479
00:27:28,209 --> 00:27:34,291
on the night of the death
of Monsieur Chevenix,

480
00:27:34,584 --> 00:27:36,291
where were you at 8:00?

481
00:27:36,584 --> 00:27:38,666
- I was in the house.

482
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:40,374
- But you went out, I think.
- Did I?

483
00:27:40,667 --> 00:27:41,958
- Oh, yes, there was mud
on your shoes.

484
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,999
I remarked on the fact.

485
00:27:44,292 --> 00:27:46,291
- You don't miss a thing,
do you?

486
00:27:46,584 --> 00:27:47,666
Well, yes.

487
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:49,541
I went out twice.

488
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:52,874
At about 6:00, I went to pick
some daisies just by the study.

489
00:27:53,167 --> 00:27:54,458
- And later?

490
00:27:57,209 --> 00:28:00,291
It must have been
just after 8:00,

491
00:28:00,584 --> 00:28:01,749
I realized
I'd dropped my brooch,

492
00:28:02,042 --> 00:28:03,249
and I went back to get it.

493
00:28:03,542 --> 00:28:05,333
- It is as simple as that.

494
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:08,583
- If you don't believe me,
you can ask Miss Lingard.

495
00:28:08,875 --> 00:28:10,124
- Mademoiselle Lingard?

496
00:28:10,417 --> 00:28:12,749
- She was in the lounge
when I came in.

497
00:28:28,292 --> 00:28:29,166
Mr. Poirot.

498
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:30,458
- Mademoiselle Lingard.

499
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,249
- Captain Hastings.
- Miss Lingard.

500
00:28:32,542 --> 00:28:34,083
- Ah, you quite startled me.

501
00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:36,041
- Still working on the book,
I see.

502
00:28:36,334 --> 00:28:37,583
- Well, yes.

503
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:39,291
I was paid
until the end of the month,

504
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:41,208
and the book's
so nearly finished,

505
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,083
it's a shame to stop now.

506
00:28:43,375 --> 00:28:46,499
- But this is not, I believe,
a fauve painting.

507
00:28:46,792 --> 00:28:49,333
- No, it's later.

508
00:28:49,625 --> 00:28:53,124
But it's
such a beautiful painting,

509
00:28:53,417 --> 00:28:54,958
so sad.

510
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,708
- Yes, indeed.

511
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,541
Mademoiselle Lingard,

512
00:28:58,834 --> 00:29:00,666
I wonder if I might
ask you some questions

513
00:29:00,959 --> 00:29:03,583
concerning the death
of Monsieur Gervase Chevenix.

514
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,374
On the night of his death,

515
00:29:05,667 --> 00:29:07,624
as the study door
was being broken open,

516
00:29:07,917 --> 00:29:10,541
I noticed that you bent down
to retrieve something.

517
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:12,624
- Oh, yes.

518
00:29:14,292 --> 00:29:16,166
It was this.

519
00:29:16,459 --> 00:29:17,874
- Oh, looks like a bullet.

520
00:29:18,167 --> 00:29:19,458
- That's what I thought.

521
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:23,291
But in fact,
it's a cuff link.

522
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:26,041
I believe it belongs
to Mr. Trent.

523
00:29:26,334 --> 00:29:28,124
I was meaning
to give it back to him.

524
00:29:28,417 --> 00:29:30,249
- I wonder what it was doing
outside the study.

525
00:29:30,542 --> 00:29:31,458
- I've no idea.

526
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:32,999
- If you permit,
I shall return it to him

527
00:29:33,292 --> 00:29:34,208
on your behalf.

528
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,458
- Oh, thank you.

529
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:39,708
- One final question,
Mademoiselle Lingard.

530
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,833
Ruth Chevenix.

531
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:44,499
- What about her?

532
00:29:44,792 --> 00:29:46,041
- I understand
that you saw her

533
00:29:46,334 --> 00:29:47,999
just before the body
was discovered.

534
00:29:48,292 --> 00:29:49,333
- Yes.

535
00:29:49,625 --> 00:29:52,458
It was just after we all
heard the shot.

536
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,541
She was with me
in the living room.

537
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:56,666
- Ah.

538
00:29:56,959 --> 00:29:59,916
It is as I thought.

539
00:30:00,209 --> 00:30:02,291
Merci.

540
00:30:02,584 --> 00:30:05,874
- Well, that seems
to back up Ruth's story.

541
00:30:06,167 --> 00:30:07,708
- Tell me, Hastings,
what was your opinion

542
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,999
of Mademoiselle Ruth?

543
00:30:09,292 --> 00:30:10,624
- Well, I don't know.

544
00:30:10,917 --> 00:30:14,041
I'd like to know why she seemed
so keen to defend John Lake.

545
00:30:14,334 --> 00:30:15,583
- Précisément.

546
00:30:15,875 --> 00:30:17,833
And that is also the question
that exercises

547
00:30:18,125 --> 00:30:20,249
the little gray cells
of Poirot.

548
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,916
- All right, Poirot, you win.

549
00:30:27,209 --> 00:30:28,708
It wasn't suicide.

550
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,624
- From what comes this
change of mind, Chief Inspector?

551
00:30:31,917 --> 00:30:33,041
- Well, it's like you said.

552
00:30:33,334 --> 00:30:35,291
Gervase Chevenix
was right-handed.

553
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:37,999
But when we found him,
the gun was in his left hand.

554
00:30:38,292 --> 00:30:39,208
- Oui.

555
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,541
- And as for the bullet,

556
00:30:40,834 --> 00:30:43,374
it's vanished into thin air.

557
00:30:43,667 --> 00:30:45,291
- Isn't it in the wall?

558
00:30:45,584 --> 00:30:46,958
- Nowhere.

559
00:30:48,625 --> 00:30:50,791
And here's something

560
00:30:51,084 --> 00:30:52,708
that you ought to see...

561
00:30:54,709 --> 00:30:58,041
The last will and testament
of Gervase Chevenix,

562
00:30:58,334 --> 00:31:00,958
leaving his fortune--
and it's a tidy sum--

563
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:03,791
to Vanda and Ruth Chevenix.

564
00:31:04,084 --> 00:31:06,166
They split it 50/50.

565
00:31:06,459 --> 00:31:09,541
Oh, and there's a bequest
of £2,000

566
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:12,166
to Hugo Trent.

567
00:31:13,417 --> 00:31:14,416
- Ah.

568
00:31:14,709 --> 00:31:16,499
So he received his capital
after all.

569
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:17,833
- Ah, yes.

570
00:31:18,125 --> 00:31:20,791
But there's something else.

571
00:31:21,084 --> 00:31:24,291
We found this
in one of his desk drawers,

572
00:31:24,584 --> 00:31:25,916
unlocked.

573
00:31:26,209 --> 00:31:27,999
Anyone could have seen it.

574
00:31:34,875 --> 00:31:36,208
- A second will.

575
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,416
- Yes,

576
00:31:37,709 --> 00:31:39,916
but unsigned.

577
00:31:44,875 --> 00:31:46,958
- What does it entail?

578
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:49,499
- It's completely barmy.

579
00:31:49,792 --> 00:31:51,416
Vanda Chevenix gets everything

580
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:54,624
if Hugo Trent and Ruth Chevenix
don't marry each other.

581
00:31:54,917 --> 00:31:56,666
- I say.

582
00:31:56,959 --> 00:31:58,166
That sounds like
a motive for murder

583
00:31:58,459 --> 00:31:59,291
if ever I heard one.

584
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:00,374
- Right.

585
00:32:00,625 --> 00:32:03,124
That's what I thought too.

586
00:32:03,417 --> 00:32:05,249
- So you are suggesting
that Monsieur Chevenix

587
00:32:05,542 --> 00:32:07,916
was killed to prevent him
from signing this new will?

588
00:32:08,209 --> 00:32:10,041
- Right.

589
00:32:13,042 --> 00:32:14,624
- It is possible, yes.

590
00:32:14,917 --> 00:32:17,041
- But there's one thing
I'd like to know, Poirot.

591
00:32:17,334 --> 00:32:18,958
- What is that,
Chief Inspector?

592
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:21,416
- What exactly were you doing
at Hamborough Close?

593
00:32:21,709 --> 00:32:24,208
How did you get mixed up
in all this?

594
00:32:25,334 --> 00:32:26,458
Fraud?

595
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:29,499
- That is what Monsieur Chevenix
believed.

596
00:32:40,084 --> 00:32:41,916
- Northgate Development.

597
00:32:42,209 --> 00:32:43,999
Not quite what you'd expect,
is it?

598
00:32:44,292 --> 00:32:46,499
- Well, if this place is just
a front, Captain Hastings,

599
00:32:46,792 --> 00:32:49,041
it's exactly what I'd expect.

600
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,124
Yeah, the door's open.

601
00:33:01,709 --> 00:33:03,583
It's very quiet.

602
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:07,083
There doesn't seem
to be anybody about.

603
00:33:07,375 --> 00:33:08,874
- Place is deserted.

604
00:33:09,167 --> 00:33:11,083
- Must've done a buck.

605
00:33:12,917 --> 00:33:14,666
- I say, Poirot.

606
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:16,249
Come and look at this.

607
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:22,791
Pond Street, Harrow.

608
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,499
It's a scale model
of the development.

609
00:33:24,792 --> 00:33:27,624
- Does it not remind you
of something, Hastings?

610
00:33:27,917 --> 00:33:30,041
- Looks a bit like
Hamborough Close.

611
00:33:30,334 --> 00:33:32,708
- It is the work
of the same hand.

612
00:33:35,917 --> 00:33:39,208
Hastings, do you smell smoke?

613
00:33:40,584 --> 00:33:42,124
Yes.

614
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,583
- God, there's someone in there.

615
00:33:55,875 --> 00:33:57,208
Japp!

616
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,874
- What is it?

617
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,624
Blimey.

618
00:34:07,792 --> 00:34:09,333
- It's John Lake.

619
00:34:09,625 --> 00:34:12,208
- Come on, get him outside.

620
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,291
- Oh, sacre bleu.

621
00:34:14,584 --> 00:34:16,666
The fire, it is spreading!

622
00:34:18,292 --> 00:34:19,374
Chief Inspector,

623
00:34:19,667 --> 00:34:21,708
Hastings, follow me!

624
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:27,499
Careful, Captain Hastings.

625
00:34:27,792 --> 00:34:29,333
- Ugh, I can't see.

626
00:34:50,167 --> 00:34:51,791
Good Lord.

627
00:35:03,584 --> 00:35:06,249
- Mr. Poirot.

628
00:35:06,542 --> 00:35:08,041
I'm sorry.

629
00:35:08,334 --> 00:35:09,749
I've been foolish.

630
00:35:10,042 --> 00:35:12,124
- You wish to tell me
about Northgate Development,

631
00:35:12,417 --> 00:35:13,333
Monsieur Lake?

632
00:35:13,625 --> 00:35:15,083
- Yes.

633
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,083
Yes.

634
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,999
I didn't know what I was doing.

635
00:35:22,292 --> 00:35:23,999
That's the truth of it.

636
00:35:24,292 --> 00:35:26,249
I was out of my depth.

637
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:32,083
To start with,
I was just the architect.

638
00:35:32,375 --> 00:35:35,833
Then they asked me
if I'd like to be a partner.

639
00:35:36,125 --> 00:35:37,458
I didn't know anything
about business,

640
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:40,333
but I was flattered.

641
00:35:40,625 --> 00:35:42,833
- And so you helped them
to raise the finance?

642
00:35:43,125 --> 00:35:44,041
- Yes.

643
00:35:44,334 --> 00:35:46,999
- And they disappeared with it,
leaving you to carry the can.

644
00:35:47,292 --> 00:35:49,041
- That's right.

645
00:35:49,334 --> 00:35:52,999
When Gervase called you in,
I was afraid.

646
00:35:53,292 --> 00:35:55,499
I panicked.

647
00:35:55,792 --> 00:35:57,999
I just wanted
to get rid of the evidence.

648
00:35:58,292 --> 00:36:02,083
- So it was you
that started the blaze.

649
00:36:02,375 --> 00:36:04,458
- I set a device,

650
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:06,083
a timer.

651
00:36:06,375 --> 00:36:09,624
- Which misfired.

652
00:36:13,459 --> 00:36:15,124
- If you--

653
00:36:15,417 --> 00:36:17,791
if you hadn't found me...

654
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:28,749
- Mr. Poirot.

655
00:36:29,042 --> 00:36:29,958
- Mademoiselle.

656
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,458
- Chief Inspector.

657
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:34,416
I have to go in.

658
00:36:34,709 --> 00:36:36,166
- I'm sorry, miss,
no visitors.

659
00:36:36,459 --> 00:36:38,333
- But you don't understand.
I must see him.

660
00:36:38,625 --> 00:36:39,416
- It's family only.

661
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:41,749
Those are doctor's orders.

662
00:36:42,042 --> 00:36:45,458
- I am family, Chief Inspector.

663
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,541
I'm his wife.

664
00:36:49,459 --> 00:36:52,374
John and I were married
a week ago.

665
00:36:54,459 --> 00:36:56,333
Can I go in?

666
00:36:57,875 --> 00:37:00,708
- Your husband awaits you.

667
00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:08,791
- Well, well, well.

668
00:37:10,084 --> 00:37:13,166
- So Ruth
secretly married John.

669
00:37:13,459 --> 00:37:15,541
Well, good luck to her
is all I can say.

670
00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:17,249
- But you also have plans
for the marriage,

671
00:37:17,542 --> 00:37:18,458
Mademoiselle Susan.

672
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:19,916
- Yes, and from now on,

673
00:37:20,209 --> 00:37:21,874
I'll be helping Hugo
with his business.

674
00:37:22,167 --> 00:37:23,999
- But what brings you here,
Mr. Poirot?

675
00:37:24,292 --> 00:37:25,208
Do you want to place an order?

676
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,916
- Oh, non, non, non.
Non, non, Monsieur Trent.

677
00:37:27,209 --> 00:37:28,083
It is just this.

678
00:37:28,375 --> 00:37:30,166
It belongs, I think, to you?

679
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,916
- Yes.

680
00:37:34,209 --> 00:37:35,916
Yes, it is mine.

681
00:37:36,209 --> 00:37:37,749
Where did you find it?

682
00:37:38,042 --> 00:37:40,708
- Monsieur Trent, on the night
that your uncle died,

683
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,124
did you see Monsieur John Lake?

684
00:37:43,417 --> 00:37:44,291
- No.

685
00:37:44,584 --> 00:37:46,083
No, he was in the library.

686
00:37:46,375 --> 00:37:47,541
- You heard the shot?

687
00:37:47,834 --> 00:37:48,791
- Yes.

688
00:37:49,084 --> 00:37:50,249
Susan heard it too.

689
00:37:50,542 --> 00:37:51,583
- Yes.

690
00:37:51,875 --> 00:37:53,208
I was dashing down the corridor.

691
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,291
I thought it was
a car backfiring.

692
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:57,374
- But why were you dashing,
Mademoiselle?

693
00:37:57,667 --> 00:37:59,583
- Well, I'd got muddled
with the gongs,

694
00:37:59,875 --> 00:38:01,458
and I was terrified
of being late.

695
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:04,083
You see, I thought I'd
already heard the first gong.

696
00:38:04,375 --> 00:38:05,916
- Yes, I thought I heard it too.

697
00:38:06,209 --> 00:38:09,041
- Exactly, Hastings.

698
00:38:09,334 --> 00:38:13,874
And yet I, Hercule Poirot,
did not hear.

699
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:21,208
The case is solved.

700
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,541
- Solved? How?

701
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:23,791
- Ah, Hastings.

702
00:38:24,084 --> 00:38:26,166
Did you not hear the testimony
of Mademoiselle Cardwell?

703
00:38:26,459 --> 00:38:28,249
And do you not recollect
the bottle of champagne?

704
00:38:28,542 --> 00:38:29,916
- It's gonna take
more than champagne

705
00:38:30,209 --> 00:38:31,249
to solve this case, Poirot.

706
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:33,583
What about the bullet,
for instance?

707
00:38:33,875 --> 00:38:36,166
- You shall have the bullet,
Chief Inspector.

708
00:38:36,459 --> 00:38:40,083
Soon you shall have everything.

709
00:38:42,667 --> 00:38:43,791
I have asked you all
to come here

710
00:38:44,084 --> 00:38:45,583
so that you might learn
the true facts

711
00:38:45,875 --> 00:38:48,416
concerning the death
of Monsieur Gervase Chevenix.

712
00:38:48,709 --> 00:38:50,333
- He is not dead.

713
00:38:50,625 --> 00:38:52,249
- Madame?

714
00:38:52,542 --> 00:38:56,374
- He is on a different
spiritual plane, that's all.

715
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,749
- There, there.

716
00:38:59,042 --> 00:39:02,666
- First, we must accept the fact
that this was not suicide.

717
00:39:02,959 --> 00:39:06,999
Monsieur Chevenix
did not kill himself, non.

718
00:39:07,292 --> 00:39:08,916
He was killed

719
00:39:09,209 --> 00:39:12,249
and by someone
in this very room.

720
00:39:12,542 --> 00:39:13,874
- It's not possible!

721
00:39:14,167 --> 00:39:16,416
- There was no one in here
when we broke in.

722
00:39:16,709 --> 00:39:18,166
And the door was locked
from the inside.

723
00:39:18,459 --> 00:39:19,874
Gervase had the key.

724
00:39:20,167 --> 00:39:21,624
And the windows were fastened.

725
00:39:21,917 --> 00:39:23,916
- Anyway, no one would have
wanted to kill him.

726
00:39:24,209 --> 00:39:25,874
- Indeed?

727
00:39:26,167 --> 00:39:27,958
And yet it was you,
Mademoiselle Cardwell,

728
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:30,458
you yourself who told to me
that you hated him

729
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:33,041
and that you would let nothing
stand in between you

730
00:39:33,334 --> 00:39:34,458
and Monsieur Hugo Trent.

731
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,166
- That's not fair.

732
00:39:36,459 --> 00:39:37,791
- And you, Monsieur Trent?

733
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:41,166
You were desperate
to see your business succeed.

734
00:39:41,459 --> 00:39:43,666
- It's true.
I--I needed money.

735
00:39:43,959 --> 00:39:46,583
- Money which you now have,
Monsieur,

736
00:39:46,875 --> 00:39:48,499
money which you would
never have received

737
00:39:48,792 --> 00:39:50,416
without the death of your uncle.

738
00:39:57,625 --> 00:39:59,999
You also, Monsieur Lake.

739
00:40:00,292 --> 00:40:01,749
Oh, yes.

740
00:40:02,042 --> 00:40:05,416
You are afraid from the moment
you set eyes on Poirot.

741
00:40:05,709 --> 00:40:07,874
You have not only
committed arson.

742
00:40:08,167 --> 00:40:09,958
You also persuaded
Monsieur Chevenix

743
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:12,874
to part with a sum
of £10,000.

744
00:40:13,167 --> 00:40:14,791
- That wasn't my fault.

745
00:40:15,084 --> 00:40:16,624
- Non?

746
00:40:16,917 --> 00:40:20,708
I think Monsieur Chevenix
might have disagreed.

747
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,583
And you also.

748
00:40:23,875 --> 00:40:26,124
You had every good reason
to wish your guardian dead,

749
00:40:26,417 --> 00:40:27,333
Madame Lake.

750
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:29,749
- I had no reason at all.

751
00:40:30,042 --> 00:40:30,999
And anyway,
even if it was murder,

752
00:40:31,292 --> 00:40:32,124
it couldn't have been me.

753
00:40:32,417 --> 00:40:33,208
- Non?

754
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,291
- I told you, Mr. Poirot.

755
00:40:34,542 --> 00:40:35,958
Miss Ruth
was in the living room with me

756
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:37,583
when Mr. Chevenix was killed.

757
00:40:37,875 --> 00:40:39,833
- At what time was that,
Mademoiselle Lingard?

758
00:40:40,125 --> 00:40:41,708
And at what time
did Mr. Chevenix die?

759
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,458
- We know what time he died.

760
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:44,541
We heard the shot.

761
00:40:44,834 --> 00:40:46,749
- Non, non, non.

762
00:40:47,042 --> 00:40:48,999
You were deceived.

763
00:40:49,292 --> 00:40:54,333
At 8:00, Monsieur Chevenix
was indeed in his study

764
00:40:54,625 --> 00:40:56,833
working at his desk.

765
00:40:57,125 --> 00:41:00,333
But he was not alone
in the room.

766
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,583
He turned.

767
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:07,249
- The gun was silenced.

768
00:41:07,542 --> 00:41:11,874
No one heard the shot.

769
00:41:12,167 --> 00:41:14,458
So...

770
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:18,458
let us now consider the language
of the bullet.

771
00:41:21,625 --> 00:41:23,208
Hastings, please to sit.

772
00:41:26,375 --> 00:41:27,916
The gun was discovered

773
00:41:28,209 --> 00:41:31,458
in the left hand
of Monsieur Chevenix.

774
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:34,249
- Good. My card.

775
00:41:34,542 --> 00:41:35,958
- And yet
from our very first meeting,

776
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:39,374
I knew that Monsieur Chevenix
was right-handed.

777
00:41:39,667 --> 00:41:43,333
But if the bullet
was fired from behind...

778
00:41:43,625 --> 00:41:45,541
Hastings?

779
00:41:45,834 --> 00:41:47,708
Comme ça,

780
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,333
how could it possibly
hit the mirror,

781
00:41:49,625 --> 00:41:51,249
which is to the side?

782
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:52,541
- It couldn't have.

783
00:41:52,834 --> 00:41:53,666
- Non.

784
00:41:53,959 --> 00:41:54,999
So now let us suppose

785
00:41:55,292 --> 00:41:56,791
that the door to the study
was open.

786
00:41:57,084 --> 00:41:58,624
If you please, Monsieur Snell.

787
00:42:04,292 --> 00:42:05,874
Thank you.

788
00:42:06,167 --> 00:42:08,416
And again, Hastings?

789
00:42:08,709 --> 00:42:11,291
The gun comme ça.

790
00:42:12,709 --> 00:42:15,374
- It would've hit the gong.

791
00:42:15,667 --> 00:42:17,749
So that was the gong I heard.

792
00:42:18,042 --> 00:42:19,916
- Well, then how did the mirror
get broken?

793
00:42:20,209 --> 00:42:23,541
- The murderer wanted to make
an appearance of suicide.

794
00:42:23,834 --> 00:42:26,291
But what if the sound
of the gong has been heard?

795
00:42:26,584 --> 00:42:28,541
Then it would be known
that the door to the study

796
00:42:28,834 --> 00:42:30,624
was open and not closed.

797
00:42:30,917 --> 00:42:34,291
Quickly, the door is closed

798
00:42:34,584 --> 00:42:36,749
and locked.

799
00:42:37,042 --> 00:42:37,833
The gun is placed

800
00:42:38,084 --> 00:42:40,666
into the left hand
of the dead man.

801
00:42:40,959 --> 00:42:43,249
The key goes into the pocket.

802
00:42:43,542 --> 00:42:46,833
The suicide note of one word
is easily forged

803
00:42:47,125 --> 00:42:50,333
and the mirror
deliberately smashed.

804
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:55,458
When I first came here,

805
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:57,458
you will remember,
Chief Inspector,

806
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:59,833
that I discovered a fragment
of the looking glass

807
00:43:00,125 --> 00:43:02,041
attached to this brass ornament,

808
00:43:02,334 --> 00:43:05,916
the base of which
was also slightly damaged.

809
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:09,041
It was then
that I saw the light.

810
00:43:09,334 --> 00:43:11,083
- So what happened then?

811
00:43:11,375 --> 00:43:13,083
How did the killer leave?

812
00:43:13,375 --> 00:43:16,333
- The killer left
through the window,

813
00:43:16,625 --> 00:43:19,749
cleverly closing the latch
from the outside.

814
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:22,291
Voilà.

815
00:43:22,584 --> 00:43:23,666
- So who was it?

816
00:43:23,959 --> 00:43:26,583
Who was the murderer?

817
00:43:29,125 --> 00:43:32,999
- Who entered the house
that night from the garden?

818
00:43:34,209 --> 00:43:36,666
And who would have lost
everything

819
00:43:36,959 --> 00:43:41,249
if Monsieur Chevenix had lived
to sign his new will?

820
00:43:41,542 --> 00:43:42,916
- What new will?

821
00:43:43,209 --> 00:43:45,416
- The will that disinherited you
completely

822
00:43:45,709 --> 00:43:47,999
if you did not marry
Monsieur Hugo Trent.

823
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,166
But it was too late,
Madame Lake,

824
00:43:50,459 --> 00:43:51,999
for you were already married.

825
00:43:52,292 --> 00:43:53,291
- No!

826
00:43:53,584 --> 00:43:54,374
You're wrong!

827
00:43:54,625 --> 00:43:55,624
Stop him!

828
00:43:55,917 --> 00:43:57,583
- Non, monsieur,
Poirot is never wrong.

829
00:43:57,875 --> 00:43:58,958
The will,
it was left in this room.

830
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:00,374
You could have seen it
at any time.

831
00:44:00,667 --> 00:44:02,499
But it was too late to undo
what you had already done.

832
00:44:02,792 --> 00:44:03,708
Oh, yes, you were married

833
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,624
but to the man
your guardian most disliked.

834
00:44:05,917 --> 00:44:07,208
- I was going to tell him.

835
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,666
I hated lying.

836
00:44:08,959 --> 00:44:10,291
I'd planned to tell him
that very night.

837
00:44:10,584 --> 00:44:12,166
- Non, not to tell him, madame--
to kill him.

838
00:44:12,459 --> 00:44:13,583
- You're wrong!

839
00:44:13,875 --> 00:44:15,291
- There's not a word of truth
in your story.

840
00:44:15,584 --> 00:44:17,791
It's a lie from start to finish.

841
00:44:19,417 --> 00:44:22,874
- That is for a jury to decide.

842
00:44:33,584 --> 00:44:35,333
- Are you sure you're gonna
be all right, Vanda?

843
00:44:35,625 --> 00:44:36,791
- Yes, yes.

844
00:44:37,084 --> 00:44:39,041
Good night, Hugo.

845
00:44:39,334 --> 00:44:41,333
- Good night,
Mrs. Chevenix.

846
00:44:48,459 --> 00:44:50,374
Poor Ruth.

847
00:44:50,667 --> 00:44:51,708
I still don't believe it.

848
00:45:05,209 --> 00:45:07,916
- I hope you know
what you're doing, Poirot.

849
00:45:29,375 --> 00:45:31,249
- Vanda.

850
00:45:31,542 --> 00:45:33,958
Wake up.

851
00:45:40,375 --> 00:45:41,749
- Who is it?

852
00:45:43,375 --> 00:45:46,666
- It's Safra, Vanda.

853
00:45:47,875 --> 00:45:52,291
Come downstairs.

854
00:46:15,334 --> 00:46:19,749
It was you, Vanda.

855
00:46:20,042 --> 00:46:21,958
You killed him.

856
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:23,166
- No.

857
00:46:23,459 --> 00:46:30,791
- You know it was.
You killed Gervase.

858
00:46:31,084 --> 00:46:34,499
Come down.

859
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:37,958
Come down!

860
00:46:43,959 --> 00:46:46,208
You killed him

861
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,624
because you hated him.

862
00:46:48,917 --> 00:46:52,916
Now you must make amends!

863
00:46:53,209 --> 00:46:54,541
- I didn't.

864
00:46:54,834 --> 00:46:57,124
- What have you hidden

865
00:46:57,417 --> 00:46:59,791
in your locket, Vanda?

866
00:47:01,209 --> 00:47:05,541
The bullet
that killed your husband!

867
00:47:05,834 --> 00:47:07,874
- No.

868
00:47:12,209 --> 00:47:17,874
- You must write a note
admitting it!

869
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:23,916
And then...

870
00:47:24,209 --> 00:47:26,166
- No.

871
00:47:32,125 --> 00:47:33,749
- It is enough.

872
00:47:37,959 --> 00:47:39,208
I knew that you would
try something,

873
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:40,541
Mademoiselle Lingard.

874
00:47:40,834 --> 00:47:42,541
But this?

875
00:47:42,834 --> 00:47:44,208
- It's diabolical.

876
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,958
- I had to save her.

877
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:49,833
I had to save Ruth.

878
00:47:50,125 --> 00:47:52,083
- Yes, I know.

879
00:47:52,375 --> 00:47:53,458
And in order to save her,

880
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:56,291
you killed
Monsieur Gervase Chevenix.

881
00:47:57,959 --> 00:47:59,124
And you are the real mother

882
00:47:59,417 --> 00:48:01,291
of Ruth Chevenix,
are you not?

883
00:48:01,584 --> 00:48:03,208
The typist
with whom the brother

884
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:06,083
of Monsieur Gervase Chevenix
fell in love.

885
00:48:06,375 --> 00:48:07,999
- How did you know?

886
00:48:08,292 --> 00:48:10,999
- There could be
no other explanation.

887
00:48:11,292 --> 00:48:14,708
And in the museum,
that was when I saw.

888
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,083
- But it's
such a beautiful painting,

889
00:48:19,375 --> 00:48:21,499
so sad.

890
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:27,791
- It was a painting of a mother
who loses her child.

891
00:48:28,084 --> 00:48:30,083
And it was then that I saw

892
00:48:30,375 --> 00:48:32,249
that you were also a mother

893
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:34,999
who had lost her child.

894
00:48:35,292 --> 00:48:36,833
And you came to this house,
I think,

895
00:48:37,125 --> 00:48:38,958
to check up on the daughter
that you had lost,

896
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:42,624
so you took up the position
of a researcher.

897
00:48:42,917 --> 00:48:45,166
- Yes.

898
00:48:45,459 --> 00:48:47,124
- And while you were working,

899
00:48:47,417 --> 00:48:50,916
you stumbled
across the new will.

900
00:48:51,209 --> 00:48:54,749
- He was going to ruin her life
with his...

901
00:48:55,042 --> 00:48:58,333
pride and his snobbery.

902
00:48:58,625 --> 00:49:03,041
- And so you decided to take
matters into your own hand.

903
00:49:03,334 --> 00:49:04,958
You killed
Monsieur Gervase Chevenix

904
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:07,916
exactly as I described.

905
00:49:08,209 --> 00:49:10,624
You then left the study,

906
00:49:10,917 --> 00:49:14,541
taking care to leave
no footprints in the soil.

907
00:49:20,417 --> 00:49:22,124
But unknown to you,

908
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:24,458
a few moments later,
Ruth Chevenix appeared

909
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:27,374
in search of a brooch
which she had lost.

910
00:49:31,167 --> 00:49:32,541
She found it

911
00:49:32,834 --> 00:49:36,749
but, in doing so,
left behind her own footprints.

912
00:49:37,042 --> 00:49:38,541
It was then necessary
to continue

913
00:49:38,834 --> 00:49:40,124
the illusion of suicide

914
00:49:40,417 --> 00:49:43,041
and to establish
a false time of death.

915
00:49:43,334 --> 00:49:45,833
It was very clever,
that idea of yours

916
00:49:46,125 --> 00:49:47,041
to imitate a gun.

917
00:49:50,417 --> 00:49:53,124
You then went
into the living room

918
00:49:53,417 --> 00:49:56,333
and were there
when Ruth Chevenix came in.

919
00:49:59,875 --> 00:50:02,583
- Good evening, Miss Ruth.

920
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:05,041
- Oh, good evening,
Miss Lingard.

921
00:50:05,334 --> 00:50:07,666
- I found it most significant
that you did not tell to me

922
00:50:07,959 --> 00:50:09,416
that Ruth Chevenix
entered the living room

923
00:50:09,709 --> 00:50:10,999
from the garden.

924
00:50:11,292 --> 00:50:13,624
- Well, how could I?

925
00:50:13,917 --> 00:50:16,291
It would have incriminated her.

926
00:50:18,292 --> 00:50:20,999
- And there was now
but one thing left to do:

927
00:50:21,292 --> 00:50:23,208
the bullet.

928
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:24,791
- I found it by the gong

929
00:50:25,084 --> 00:50:28,624
when you were
breaking open the door.

930
00:50:28,917 --> 00:50:32,416
I wanted to drop it
inside the study,

931
00:50:32,709 --> 00:50:35,458
but I didn't get the chance.

932
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:38,624
- And the cuff link
of Monsieur Trent?

933
00:50:39,959 --> 00:50:42,166
- I stole that from his room.

934
00:50:42,459 --> 00:50:45,958
I knew you'd seen me
picking up the bullet,

935
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:48,208
so I had to have
something to show you.

936
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:49,749
- Yes.

937
00:50:50,042 --> 00:50:54,624
You almost succeeded
in confusing Poirot.

938
00:50:57,209 --> 00:50:58,374
Chief Inspector.

939
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,166
- I think you'd better come
along with me, Miss Lingard.

940
00:51:07,542 --> 00:51:10,291
Mr. Poirot.

941
00:51:10,584 --> 00:51:13,708
I don't want Ruth to see me.

942
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,708
I don't care
what happens to me,

943
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,624
but please...

944
00:51:20,917 --> 00:51:23,041
Don't let her see me.

945
00:51:29,417 --> 00:51:32,291
- You have my word.

946
00:51:32,584 --> 00:51:35,083
- Thank you.
