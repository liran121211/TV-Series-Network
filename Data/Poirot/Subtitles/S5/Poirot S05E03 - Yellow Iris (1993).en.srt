Don't try to stop me, Pauline.

8
00:01:29,492 --> 00:01:30,681
I have to do it.

9
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:33,748
I'm afraid.

10
00:01:34,016 --> 00:01:35,172
Don't be.

00:01:42,451 --> 00:01:45,832
He will rest, Iris.
I swear it.

13
00:02:05,263 --> 00:02:06,691
Good morning, Poirot.

14
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,226
Bonjour, Hastings.

15
00:02:10,362 --> 00:02:12,631
Is that all you're having?

16
00:02:12,931 --> 00:02:13,967
What more is there to have?

17
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:16,045
- A decent English breakfast.
- And what is that, Hastings?

18
00:02:16,305 --> 00:02:19,260
Well, porridge, two eggs,
sausage, bacon, tomato,

19
00:02:19,563 --> 00:02:20,992
toast and marmalade,
and a pot of tea.

20
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,246
That's what I had, anyway.

21
00:02:22,247 --> 00:02:24,549
After such a meal of things,
I think I will return to my bed.

22
00:02:24,816 --> 00:02:26,931
No, no, no.
This will suffice for Poirot.

23
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:28,464
Is there anything
in the English cuisine

24
00:02:28,727 --> 00:02:29,534
that you like, Poirot?

25
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,457
The English, they do not have
a cuisine, my friend.

26
00:02:31,717 --> 00:02:33,299
They have only the food.
Well, that's a bit harsh.

27
00:02:33,557 --> 00:02:35,400
Like the meat, overcooked.
The vegetables, too soft.

28
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:36,942
The cheese, inedible.

29
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,010
And the day the English create
their own wines

30
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,691
is the day I return home
to Belgium.

31
00:02:41,954 --> 00:02:45,214
Oh, this new restaurant should
be right up your street then.

32
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,983

They say it'll serve
the best French food in London,

00:02:53,149 --> 00:02:54,228
all flown in specially.

00:02:54,491 --> 00:02:56,606
<i>Le Jardin des Cygnes.</i>

37
00:02:56,906 --> 00:02:58,749
That name,
it is familiar to me.

38
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:03,731
The garden of scenes?

39
00:03:03,999 --> 00:03:06,267
Swans, Hastings.
Swans.

40
00:03:06,567 --> 00:03:08,301
Oh, well, perhaps they'll be
on the menu.

41
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:10,257
It all looks very exotic.

42
00:03:10,555 --> 00:03:12,246
What do you say, Poirot?
Dinner for two?

43
00:03:13,315 --> 00:03:15,779
I say, Hastings,
it is time for work.

44
00:03:19,526 --> 00:03:20,333
Thank you.

Bonjour, Miss Lemon.

50
00:03:35,054 --> 00:03:36,242
What is it that you have there?

51
00:03:36,511 --> 00:03:37,863
I found it with the post.

52
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,773
I suppose someone must have
left it for you.

53
00:03:40,076 --> 00:03:42,540
An admirer, perhaps?

54
00:03:42,798 --> 00:03:45,416
The yellow iris.

55
00:03:45,674 --> 00:03:48,749
First <i>Le Jardin des Cygnes,
and now</i> this.

56
00:03:49,009 --> 00:03:50,394
It is a conspiracy.
Poirot.

57
00:03:50,696 --> 00:03:52,233
Hastings, why do you now
mention this restaurant to me?

58
00:03:52,536 --> 00:03:54,074
And you, Miss Lemon.
I didn't mean to upset you.

59
00:03:54,338 --> 00:03:56,334
The yellow iris.

60
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,182
It returns to provoke me.

61
00:04:12,473 --> 00:04:14,316
I say, old chap,
are you feeling all right?

62
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,660
Can I get you anything,
Mr. Poirot?

63
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,418
No, thank you, Miss Lemon.
Please, do sit.

64
00:04:30,684 --> 00:04:33,334
There is something
I must get out of my chest.

65
00:04:33,598 --> 00:04:34,711
The yellow iris.

66
00:04:34,978 --> 00:04:37,857
Yes, Hastings,
the yellow iris.

67
00:04:38,122 --> 00:04:40,085
It reminds me of a case
that I was not able to solve.

68
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:41,305
I don't believe it.

69
00:04:41,611 --> 00:04:43,912
Through no fault of my own,
Miss Lemon.

70
00:04:45,636 --> 00:04:46,673
You will recall, Hastings,

71
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:47,943
that you once asked me
to visit you

72
00:04:48,243 --> 00:04:49,399
when you were living
in the Argentine?

73
00:04:49,662 --> 00:04:51,090
Well, that was two years ago.

74
00:04:51,349 --> 00:04:52,123
And you were going to come,

75
00:04:52,384 --> 00:04:53,998
but you canceled
at the last minute.

76
00:04:54,263 --> 00:04:55,222
That is true.
I said as much.

77
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,224
But it was not quite like that.

78
00:05:00,665 --> 00:05:03,283
I was looking forward to
my visit to you, Hastings.

79
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:06,534
It was to be my first time
in the Argentine.

80
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,337
I broke my journey
in Buenos Aires

81
00:05:08,602 --> 00:05:11,524
and was due to travel
to your ranch in Los Pampas.

82
00:05:11,784 --> 00:05:14,248
However,
because a general strike

83
00:05:14,506 --> 00:05:16,011
had disrupted
the transport services,

84
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,309
I was forced to book
into a hotel.

85
00:05:22,174 --> 00:05:23,559
You are a liar and a cheat,

86
00:05:23,822 --> 00:05:25,709
and I don't ever want
to see you again!

87
00:05:25,969 --> 00:05:26,965
Pauline.

88
00:05:26,966 --> 00:05:28,045
All those things
you said to me,

89
00:05:28,346 --> 00:05:29,699
all those promises
you made.

90
00:05:29,957 --> 00:05:31,494
You're not interested
in me at all.

91
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:32,533
That's not true.

92
00:05:32,794 --> 00:05:33,797
You're just using me to get

93
00:05:34,097 --> 00:05:35,602
your rotten interview
with Barton!

94
00:05:35,861 --> 00:05:37,169
I meant what I said.

95
00:05:37,433 --> 00:05:40,355
I'm in love with you.

96
00:05:40,615 --> 00:05:41,891
It's true;
I do want the interview.

97
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:43,381
Well, the answer is no.

98
00:05:43,682 --> 00:05:44,686
I won't help you.

99
00:05:44,947 --> 00:05:45,754
You can't come to the dinner,

100
00:05:46,021 --> 00:05:47,864
and I don't want
to see you again.

101
00:05:51,082 --> 00:05:54,081
[heels stomping]

102
00:05:55,721 --> 00:05:57,836
The path of true love?

103
00:05:58,136 --> 00:06:00,634
It was all going
so smoothly until-

104
00:06:00,935 --> 00:06:02,975
Wait a minute.
I know you.

105
00:06:03,235 --> 00:06:04,468
I've seen your picture.

106
00:06:04,769 --> 00:06:07,146
You're Hercule Poirot.

107
00:06:07,414 --> 00:06:08,690
The rumors are
that President Yrigoyen

108
00:06:08,948 --> 00:06:10,027
can't last much longer.

109
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:11,827
- He is old?
- 79.

110
00:06:12,092 --> 00:06:13,826
That's not the point.

111
00:06:14,085 --> 00:06:15,045
He's out of touch.

112
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,430
He's got the military
on one side

113
00:06:16,692 --> 00:06:17,499
and the Catholics
on the other.

114
00:06:17,766 --> 00:06:18,954
It's just a matter of time
before one of them

115
00:06:19,261 --> 00:06:20,340
pushes him out.

116
00:06:20,603 --> 00:06:22,108
It is for this reason
that you are here?

117
00:06:22,367 --> 00:06:24,024
No, I'm following
Barton Russell

118
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:26,127
and his partner,
Stephen Carter.

119
00:06:26,392 --> 00:06:27,199
In fact,
that's Carter over there

120
00:06:27,466 --> 00:06:29,614
with a drink in his hand.

121
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,806
There's been a huge oil strike
down in the south,

122
00:06:32,066 --> 00:06:33,451
and they're after
the concession.

123
00:06:33,753 --> 00:06:34,789
They set up
the company together:

124
00:06:35,057 --> 00:06:36,016
Sovereign Oil.

125
00:06:36,284 --> 00:06:37,167
[speaking Spanish]

126
00:06:37,472 --> 00:06:38,476
Thank you.

127
00:06:39,696 --> 00:06:40,503
<i>Santé.</i>

128
00:06:40,769 --> 00:06:41,773

[chuckles]

129
00:06:44,603 --> 00:06:48,333
So tell me,

130
00:06:48,591 --> 00:06:50,019
what of your young lady?

131
00:06:50,278 --> 00:06:52,164
Pauline Wetherby.

132
00:06:52,425 --> 00:06:54,889
You must've heard about
the beautiful Wetherby girls.

133
00:06:55,147 --> 00:06:57,295
Pauline and Iris,
daughters of Lord Wetherby.

134
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,985
No.

135
00:06:59,249 --> 00:07:00,438
He was a Labor Peer.

136
00:07:00,706 --> 00:07:01,982
He made his fortune in textiles.

137
00:07:02,278 --> 00:07:04,699
When he died, Iris got it all.

138
00:07:04,962 --> 00:07:07,263
And Iris Wetherby,
she is also here?

139
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:08,305
Of course.

140
00:07:08,566 --> 00:07:09,951
She's Barton Russell's wife.

141
00:07:10,214 --> 00:07:11,719
- Ah.
- She'll be there tonight.

142
00:07:12,016 --> 00:07:13,292
<i>Le Jardin des Cygnes.</i>

143
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,782
Barton's having a big dinner.

144
00:07:15,045 --> 00:07:17,237
And I was trying to get Pauline
to invite me.

145
00:07:17,499 --> 00:07:19,800
You see, I think Barton
Russell's up to something,

146
00:07:20,067 --> 00:07:22,532
and I want to be the first
person to find out what.

147
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:28,972
So, General,
do we have a deal?

148
00:07:30,381 --> 00:07:32,878
You have most persuasive,
Señor Russell.

149
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,934
Government bonds.

150
00:07:40,195 --> 00:07:42,191
It seemed appropriate.

151
00:07:44,796 --> 00:07:48,177
Let us consider it
signed and sealed.

152
00:07:49,397 --> 00:07:52,200
There was, Hastings,
in the hotel, an atmosphere.

153
00:07:52,464 --> 00:07:55,005
It was not just the heat
but the uncertainty.

154
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,944
I could also feel
a growing sense of unease

155
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:00,564
and, indeed, of fear.

156
00:08:02,432 --> 00:08:03,708
Oops, the lights.

157
00:08:03,966 --> 00:08:06,616
I'm sorry, Señor.
Happens every day now.

158
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,068
It's complete confusion.

159
00:08:08,337 --> 00:08:09,371
Have this one.

160
00:08:09,372 --> 00:08:10,222
Thank you.

161
00:08:10,522 --> 00:08:11,984
Room 217, if you please.

162
00:08:12,286 --> 00:08:13,441
217, yes.

163
00:08:15,851 --> 00:08:17,040
Thank you.

164
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,447
Mr. Poirot, isn't it?

165
00:08:22,714 --> 00:08:23,521
Yes.

166
00:08:23,826 --> 00:08:25,712
I saw you talking
to that writer.

167
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:28,819
You're-you're not here
on business, are you?

168
00:08:29,078 --> 00:08:30,082
No, no, no, no, monsieur.

169
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,270
I am en route to Los Pampas.

170
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,108
Then I should get a move on
if I were you.

171
00:08:33,411 --> 00:08:35,679
Pretty dangerous round here.

172
00:08:35,941 --> 00:08:37,904
Buenos Aires really isn't
the place to be.

173
00:08:38,203 --> 00:08:39,010
You are most kind,
monsieur.

174
00:08:39,315 --> 00:08:40,274
Thank you.

175
00:08:40,542 --> 00:08:41,545
Thank you.

176
00:08:41,807 --> 00:08:42,803
Oh, hello, Iris.

177
00:08:42,804 --> 00:08:43,916
What's happened
to the electricity?

178
00:08:44,184 --> 00:08:45,918
Oh, don't tell me
it's another power cut.

179
00:08:46,178 --> 00:08:47,214
May I have my key, please?

180
00:08:47,481 --> 00:08:48,408
Iris, I need to speak to you.

181
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,213
- Now?
- May I take this?

182
00:08:50,472 --> 00:08:51,246
Yes, of course.

183
00:08:51,545 --> 00:08:52,549
Where's Barton?

184
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:55,040
I don't know.
I haven't seen him.

185
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:56,687
Who's that man
you're talking to?

186
00:08:56,951 --> 00:08:58,259
Nobody.

187
00:08:58,523 --> 00:08:59,559
Only a tourist.

188
00:08:59,826 --> 00:09:02,171
I didn't think there were
any tourists in Buenos Aires.

189
00:09:02,433 --> 00:09:03,437
It's hardly the time.

190
00:09:03,438 --> 00:09:05,357
That's what I've been trying
to tell him.

Iris!

192
00:09:10,331 --> 00:09:11,913
I beg you.

193
00:09:12,172 --> 00:09:13,055
You don't know
what you're doing.

194
00:09:13,322 --> 00:09:14,129
I know exactly
what I'm doing.

195
00:09:14,395 --> 00:09:15,551
I'm going to stop it.
It's too late.

196
00:09:15,814 --> 00:09:17,428
For you maybe.

197
00:09:17,692 --> 00:09:19,001
Iris, please.

198
00:09:19,264 --> 00:09:21,075
You'll destroy me.

199
00:09:21,373 --> 00:09:22,758
You should've thought of that
before you got involved

200
00:09:23,022 --> 00:09:23,948
in an affair like this.

201
00:09:24,248 --> 00:09:25,132
What does it matter?

202
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,435
Nobody knows about it.

203
00:09:26,702 --> 00:09:28,393
I know.

204
00:09:28,658 --> 00:09:30,010
And I can't live with it,
Stephen.

205
00:09:30,268 --> 00:09:32,537
I just can't live with it.

206
00:09:34,255 --> 00:09:36,905
Never will I forget
the words of Iris Wetherby,

207
00:09:37,169 --> 00:09:39,012
for it was then that I resolved
that I, too,

208
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:40,433
would take dinner that night

209
00:09:40,696 --> 00:09:43,389
at the restaurant called
<i>Le</i> Jardin <i>des</i> Cygnes.

- Enchanted.

And this is my new partner,
Stephen Carter.

Lola Valdez.

224
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,456

Ah.

00:10:24,441 --> 00:10:25,717
You will forgive me, Barton.

227
00:10:25,975 --> 00:10:29,051
I bring with me
a young English friend.

228
00:10:29,349 --> 00:10:31,344
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

229
00:10:31,611 --> 00:10:33,421
He's a periodista,
a journalist.

230
00:10:33,681 --> 00:10:35,829
And he will write
a grand piece on me

231
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,826
to tell the whole of England
about me.

232

Señorita, if you will just
move over to make some room.

236
00:10:49,093 --> 00:10:51,787
Why, you certainly
got a nerve, Mr. Chapell.

237
00:10:52,046 --> 00:10:54,161
- I had to get in somehow.
- To get your story?

238
00:10:54,461 --> 00:10:56,347
Hell with the story.
I came to see you.

You did not see
my new revue, Mrs. Russell.

No.
I'm not fond of dancing.

243
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:11,609
You missed a wonderful
performance, darling.

244
00:11:12,749 --> 00:11:14,559
I like to dance
before I eat.

00:11:14,819 --> 00:11:15,823
Barton.

246
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,961

The city, it was about

The military,
it was everywhere.

And many of the streets,
they were closed.

00:11:53,849 --> 00:11:55,310
This was the background
against which

255
00:11:55,612 --> 00:11:59,102

was to take place.

my lateness.

You are Hercule Poirot?

362
00:17:36,642 --> 00:17:37,562
Yes, I am.

363
00:17:37,822 --> 00:17:39,391
You are under arrest.

364
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,163
- Wait a minute.
- Be silent.

365
00:17:42,997 --> 00:17:43,993
You come now.

366
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,118
- Here, señor.
- No.

367
00:17:46,384 --> 00:17:48,559
Don't worry, Monsieur Poirot.
I'll call the French Embassy.

368
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:51,568
No, no, no, no!
The Belgian Embassy!

You're here to engage

You have my passport?

376
00:18:24,512 --> 00:18:25,508
A forgery.

377

Do you appreciate that

378
00:18:28,622 --> 00:18:32,085
I could have you taken
outside now and shot?

379
00:18:32,389 --> 00:18:33,840
I wish to see the consul.

380
00:18:34,139 --> 00:18:36,196
You will see no one.

381
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:39,393
There is a ship leaving
Ensenada in one hour.

382
00:18:39,657 --> 00:18:40,836
You will be on it.

And that was the end of it.

389
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:27,224
I was taken to a ship
and deported on the same day

390
00:19:27,527 --> 00:19:29,205
in a cabin of the third class.

391
00:19:30,609 --> 00:19:32,817
So that's why
you never came.

392
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,841
But why on earth
didn't you tell me?

393
00:19:35,137 --> 00:19:37,496
Hercule Poirot,

It was something that
I preferred not to describe.

396
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:44,238
So who did kill
Iris Russell?

397
00:19:44,536 --> 00:19:46,636
It was never discovered,
Miss Lemon.

398
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:48,648
The official verdict,
it was suicide.

399

<i>Et c'est possible.</i>

400
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,681
The body, it was sent back
to England.

401
00:19:52,946 --> 00:19:54,850
The case,
it was closed.

402
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:56,495
Until now.

403
00:19:56,751 --> 00:19:58,017
Yes.

404
00:19:58,273 --> 00:20:00,145
A yellow iris.

405
00:20:00,404 --> 00:20:02,656
Do you think it could have
been sent to you as a warning?

406
00:20:04,818 --> 00:20:07,676
A new <i>Jardin des Cygnes</i>
opens in London, eh.

407
00:20:07,938 --> 00:20:10,720
And on the day it is announced,

408
00:20:10,982 --> 00:20:14,186
a yellow iris arrives
through the post.

409
00:20:14,445 --> 00:20:16,090
No.

410
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:19,205
I think it comes rather
as a call for help.

411
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,279
But from whom?

412
00:20:21,538 --> 00:20:24,036
It is that
that we must now find out.

413
00:20:25,411 --> 00:20:26,490
Who owned the restaurant,
Poirot?

414
00:20:26,753 --> 00:20:28,748
His name, Hastings,
was Luigi, an Italian.

415
00:20:29,015 --> 00:20:30,476
An Italian with
a French restaurant

416
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,245

417
00:20:32,503 --> 00:20:34,270
Now he's opened up here
in London.

418
00:20:34,535 --> 00:20:36,269
Signor Poirot!

419
00:20:36,529 --> 00:20:38,143
I'm so glad you are here.

420
00:20:38,408 --> 00:20:39,404
Signor Luigi.

421
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:40,833
It happens all over again.

422
00:20:41,091 --> 00:20:42,128
A disaster.

423
00:20:42,395 --> 00:20:45,699
Signor Russell, he telephones
to make a reservation.

424
00:20:45,961 --> 00:20:49,069
Six people, he says,
just like last time.

425
00:20:49,334 --> 00:20:51,756
And once again,
he demands the yellow iris.

426

Monsieur Barton Russell

450
00:22:14,525 --> 00:22:15,638

Of course I remember.

That terrible night,

They asked so many questions,
and why?

454

It was obvious.

455
00:22:24,033 --> 00:22:25,537
You believe that
Madame Iris Russell,

456
00:22:25,796 --> 00:22:26,831
she committed suicide?

457
00:22:27,098 --> 00:22:28,940
Of course
she committed suicide.

458
00:22:29,244 --> 00:22:30,323
But for what reason?

459
00:22:30,585 --> 00:22:34,192
Because she knew
Barton no longer loved her.

460
00:22:34,455 --> 00:22:35,916
How well did you know her?

461
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:37,062
I didn't know her.

462
00:22:37,329 --> 00:22:39,061

He was never in Barton's league.

520

He was basically a subcontractor

want to work with him?

That's a good question.

the big time.

even for the Argentine
government.

541
00:25:35,717 --> 00:25:38,259
It looks like he's for the chop,
and if he goes,

542
00:25:38,517 --> 00:25:40,361
Sovereign Oil will go with him.

It's Mr. Poirot.

552
00:26:21,167 --> 00:26:22,825
Mr. Poirot,
is there not any comment

553
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:26,537
about financial thieves...

554
00:26:26,843 --> 00:26:28,119
Mr. Poirot, can you give us
any comment?

555
00:26:28,377 --> 00:26:29,373
Please, sir?

556
00:26:29,374 --> 00:26:31,677
Yes, Mr. Poirot,
I'm getting out.

557
00:26:31,944 --> 00:26:33,711
Going back to what
I'm best at.

558
00:26:33,977 --> 00:26:35,439
And what is that,
Monsieur Carter?

559
00:26:35,703 --> 00:26:37,394
I had my own business,
you know,

560
00:26:37,659 --> 00:26:39,579
before Sovereign Oil,

561
00:26:39,845 --> 00:26:42,496
before Barton Russell.

562
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,448
And you now return
to this business?

563
00:26:45,713 --> 00:26:48,561
Yes, if I can untangle it
from this mess.

564
00:26:48,858 --> 00:26:50,244
But I understand that much
of your finance came

565
00:26:50,507 --> 00:26:51,511
from the government.

566
00:26:51,512 --> 00:26:52,279
Yes.

567
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,046
We were excavating for them

568
00:26:54,305 --> 00:26:55,613
in Derbyshire
and up in Scotland.

569
00:26:55,877 --> 00:26:57,841
Interesting work.

570
00:26:58,102 --> 00:27:01,440
Although, of course,
there were only small returns.

571
00:27:01,707 --> 00:27:04,009
I suppose that's what
attracted you to Sovereign.

572
00:27:04,315 --> 00:27:07,392
Yes.

573
00:27:07,652 --> 00:27:11,993
It was an adventure.

574
00:27:12,254 --> 00:27:14,600
That strike in Santa Cruz.

575
00:27:14,901 --> 00:27:17,704
And if we'd held onto it...

576
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:20,118
But now you have lost
the concession, Monsieur Carter.

577
00:27:20,385 --> 00:27:21,312
Yes.

578
00:27:21,613 --> 00:27:22,692
Just two more weeks,

579
00:27:22,955 --> 00:27:25,955
and we'd have had
that oil flowing.

580
00:27:26,253 --> 00:27:29,559
We won that contract
fair and square, Mr. Poirot.

581
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,395
And now we've got nothing.

582
00:27:32,659 --> 00:27:35,157
And I'm out.

583
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,646
Thank you,
Monsieur Carter.

584
00:27:37,951 --> 00:27:41,868
One last question, if I may,
Monsieur Carter.

585
00:27:42,132 --> 00:27:45,437
Are you to see again
Monsieur Barton Russell?

586
00:27:45,699 --> 00:27:48,699
As a matter of fact,

587
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:51,184
I'm dining with him
this week.

588
00:27:51,452 --> 00:27:52,728
At <i>Le Jardin des Cygnes.</i>

589
00:27:52,986 --> 00:27:53,761
Yes.

590
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:57,322
I had a feeling that's why
you'd come here.

591
00:27:57,589 --> 00:27:59,433
Two years to the day.

592
00:28:01,693 --> 00:28:03,841
I don't really see what
business it is of yours,

593
00:28:04,109 --> 00:28:05,265
Monsieur Poirot,

594
00:28:05,566 --> 00:28:07,836
if I choose to have
a private meal with friends.

595
00:28:08,098 --> 00:28:11,981
You say friends,
and yet,

596
00:28:12,278 --> 00:28:14,165
one of them,
he is a journalist

597
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:15,463
who has just written something
about you

598
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:16,886
that is most unflattering,

599
00:28:17,188 --> 00:28:20,111
and the other is a businessman
who has decided

600
00:28:20,371 --> 00:28:22,215
that he will do with you
no further business.

601
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,637
I see you've been busy.

602
00:28:23,938 --> 00:28:24,822
<i>Oui, bien sûr.</i>

603
00:28:25,088 --> 00:28:28,165
And there is one thing
that I still do not understand.

604
00:28:29,422 --> 00:28:30,775
What is that?

605
00:28:31,033 --> 00:28:34,492
Anthony Chapell,
Stephen Carter, Lola Valdez,

606
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:37,754
Mademoiselle Pauline,
and your good self.

607
00:28:38,014 --> 00:28:39,825
That is five persons, huh?

608
00:28:40,123 --> 00:28:42,501
And yet the table,
it is for six.

609
00:28:43,767 --> 00:28:47,879
As I said, Mr. Poirot,
it's none of your business.

610
00:28:49,021 --> 00:28:52,174
The sixth place is for Iris.

611
00:28:52,435 --> 00:28:53,210
<i>Comment?</i>

612
00:28:53,509 --> 00:28:54,937
It's a commemorative dinner:

613
00:28:55,196 --> 00:28:57,116
The second anniversary
of her death,

614
00:28:57,421 --> 00:28:59,079
and we've all got to be there.

615
00:28:59,377 --> 00:29:00,108
Pauline.

616
00:29:00,413 --> 00:29:02,409
Well, I think
it's a horrible idea.

617
00:29:02,675 --> 00:29:04,061
I don't want to go.

618
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:06,790
You will go, Pauline.

619
00:29:07,086 --> 00:29:08,013
Yes.

620
00:29:08,275 --> 00:29:10,817
But you can't boss me around
forever, Barton.

621
00:29:11,075 --> 00:29:13,268
Just one more month.

622
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:16,759
Excuse me.
I'm going to go home.

623
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,176
Mademoiselle.

624
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:21,509
[sighs]

625
00:29:21,776 --> 00:29:24,198
I'm sorry.

626
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,311
Please.

627
00:29:25,573 --> 00:29:27,613
Thank you.

628
00:29:27,874 --> 00:29:32,027
Anyway, now you know.

629
00:29:32,297 --> 00:29:34,534
Monsieur Russell,
if you would be so kind

630
00:29:34,841 --> 00:29:37,267
as to tell me,
this dinner,

631
00:29:37,541 --> 00:29:39,423
why do you have it, huh?

632
00:29:39,733 --> 00:29:41,269
Why do you wish to re-create

633
00:29:41,533 --> 00:29:43,147
the night of the death
of your wife?

634
00:29:43,412 --> 00:29:46,239
All right,
I'll tell you.

635
00:29:46,504 --> 00:29:49,410
It's very simple,
Mr. Poirot.

636
00:29:49,713 --> 00:29:52,029
I know-

637
00:29:52,296 --> 00:29:54,968
I have always known.

638
00:29:55,231 --> 00:29:58,949
Iris did not commit suicide.

639
00:29:59,223 --> 00:30:00,759
She was killed
by one of the people

640
00:30:01,024 --> 00:30:03,106
sitting at that table.

641
00:30:03,411 --> 00:30:07,421
And tomorrow night,
I intend to find out which.

642
00:30:07,674 --> 00:30:10,111
Hastings, I must reserve
for myself immediately

643
00:30:10,367 --> 00:30:12,462
for tomorrow night a table at
<i>Le Jardin des Cygnes.</i>

644
00:30:12,761 --> 00:30:13,740
You want to be in
at the kill, eh?

645
00:30:13,995 --> 00:30:14,899
It is exactly that, Hastings.

646
00:30:15,154 --> 00:30:16,165
Twice it is arranged:

647
00:30:16,463 --> 00:30:17,666
the dinner, the restaurant,
the guests.

648
00:30:17,922 --> 00:30:21,368
And tomorrow night,
I must be there

649
00:30:21,624 --> 00:30:23,402
to prevent a second death.

650
00:30:34,064 --> 00:30:36,462
I don't like you going
to this restaurant, Mr. Poirot.

651
00:30:36,761 --> 00:30:37,602
It could be dangerous.

652
00:30:37,861 --> 00:30:39,460
Ah, but when Poirot himself
is involved,

653
00:30:39,722 --> 00:30:40,985
he, too, is dangerous,
Miss Lemon.

654
00:30:41,241 --> 00:30:43,640
I still Captain Hastings
were going with you.

655
00:30:43,899 --> 00:30:45,919
Ah, yes.

656
00:30:46,215 --> 00:30:48,179
The good captain Hastings.

657
00:30:48,451 --> 00:30:52,500
By now he should be in Norfolk,
the village of Reepham.

658
00:30:52,765 --> 00:30:55,599
Why did you send him there,
Mr. Poirot?

659
00:30:55,902 --> 00:30:57,832
What do you want him to find?

660
00:30:58,099 --> 00:30:59,799
A motive for murder.

661
00:31:07,017 --> 00:31:08,574
Two years.

662
00:31:08,724 --> 00:31:11,019
Two years to the day.

663
00:31:11,366 --> 00:31:15,366
I hope you don't mind
my coming here, Mr. Grove.

664
00:31:15,702 --> 00:31:19,446
I'm very glad you did,
Captain Hastings.

665
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:22,488
You see, I was
her father's solicitor.

666
00:31:22,784 --> 00:31:24,637
Lord Wetherby, you know.

667
00:31:24,944 --> 00:31:26,380
A wonderful man.

668
00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:28,460
Showed him the Ramsay MacDonald.

669
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,811
And Iris Russell inherited
his fortune.

670
00:31:31,073 --> 00:31:33,705
[chuckles]
And his ideals.

671
00:31:33,965 --> 00:31:36,246
[sobbing gently]
She was such a beautiful girl.

672
00:31:36,548 --> 00:31:38,554
It was a tragedy.

673
00:31:42,485 --> 00:31:44,721
You were telling me
about Iris' will.

674
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:46,575
Oh, there's no secret
about it.

675
00:31:46,841 --> 00:31:48,464
You see, her husband,
Barton Russell,

676
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:50,320
was a wealthy man
in his own right,

677
00:31:50,581 --> 00:31:53,903
so her money was passed across
to her sister, Pauline,

678
00:31:54,166 --> 00:31:56,140
to be held in trust
until her 21st birthday.

679
00:31:56,402 --> 00:31:57,688
I suppose you were
the trust's administrator.

680
00:31:57,947 --> 00:31:58,926
Oh, no.

681
00:31:58,927 --> 00:32:00,631
Mr. Russell is
the administrator.

682
00:32:00,886 --> 00:32:04,060
His wife made him
Pauline's guardian.

683
00:32:04,354 --> 00:32:06,058
So if Pauline were to die,

684
00:32:06,313 --> 00:32:08,575
does that mean that Barton
would inherit the trust?

685
00:32:08,876 --> 00:32:10,431
Uh, no.

686
00:32:10,723 --> 00:32:14,045
You see, Pauline has made
a will of her own.

687
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:16,721
Although-well, I mustn't
speculate

688
00:32:16,982 --> 00:32:18,285
about Pauline's intentions.

689
00:32:18,586 --> 00:32:20,540
And yet...
[sighs]

690
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,741
Sometimes, I feel afraid
for her.

691
00:32:25,036 --> 00:32:28,858
Captain Hastings,
what I can tell you is this:

692
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,107
when she signed the will,

693
00:32:32,365 --> 00:32:34,320
she was accompanied
by a young man.

694
00:32:34,617 --> 00:32:37,635
I assumed him to be
her fiancé.

695
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,932
Make of that what you will.

696
00:32:42,745 --> 00:32:45,502

After you.

701
00:33:31,622 --> 00:33:32,782

Here we all are.

Signor Luigi,
bonsoir.

Si.

00:34:27,601 --> 00:34:31,221

Ah, from Captain Hastings.
<i>C'est bien.</i>

Signor Luigi,
that table you have for me?

713
00:34:43,518 --> 00:34:46,755
I have for it no further need.

714
00:34:49,054 --> 00:34:50,410
I know it seems
a little odd,

715
00:34:50,668 --> 00:34:52,287
celebrating
the second anniversary

716
00:34:52,553 --> 00:34:56,709
of a death in this way,
but I have a reason.

717
00:34:57,013 --> 00:34:59,211

I explained.

00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:10,436
at a table like this
in a room like this.

720
00:35:10,699 --> 00:35:13,779
The same five people
surrounded her.

721
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:17,455
The police-
The Argentine police-

722
00:35:17,723 --> 00:35:21,566
recorded a verdict
of suicide.

723
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:25,323
But I have known-
I have always known-

724
00:35:25,592 --> 00:35:28,856
- And tonight, you wish
to establish the truth,

725
00:35:29,122 --> 00:35:31,273
Monsieur Russell.

726
00:35:31,579 --> 00:35:32,768
Mr. Poirot.

727
00:35:33,038 --> 00:35:34,118
I wasn't expecting you.

728
00:35:34,419 --> 00:35:36,417
But I was there
on the first night, was I not?

729
00:35:36,683 --> 00:35:37,680
That's true.

730
00:35:37,681 --> 00:35:39,952
And I also have a desire
to establish the truth,

731
00:35:40,252 --> 00:35:41,869
if you permit.

732
00:35:44,206 --> 00:35:47,132
Let him stay, Barton.

733
00:35:47,391 --> 00:35:49,280
You're right, Mr. Poirot.
You should be here.

734
00:35:49,541 --> 00:35:50,851
You're welcome to join us.

735

What were you going to say,
Barton?

738
00:36:03,052 --> 00:36:04,056
Monsieur Russell was
about to say

739
00:36:04,356 --> 00:36:05,743
that he believes his wife
was murdered

740
00:36:06,045 --> 00:36:08,469
by someone seated
around this table.

741
00:36:08,732 --> 00:36:10,271

Wait a minute.

742
00:36:10,536 --> 00:36:11,573
Who would've harmed her?

743
00:36:11,879 --> 00:36:12,993
It's-it's crazy.

744
00:36:13,261 --> 00:36:15,914
Of course it is.

745
00:36:16,178 --> 00:36:18,525
Iris committed suicide.

746
00:36:18,787 --> 00:36:20,251
Everybody knows that.

747
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,704
I do not believe
that she committed suicide.

748
00:36:22,971 --> 00:36:24,816
And I can prove it.

749
00:36:28,114 --> 00:36:29,577
I have to speak to the band.

750
00:36:29,841 --> 00:36:32,112
I have a surprise for you.

751
00:36:33,641 --> 00:36:34,875
Mr. Poirot,
can't you stop him?

752
00:36:35,138 --> 00:36:37,759
Do not worry yourself,
Monsieur Carter.

753
00:36:38,017 --> 00:36:40,211
Mr. Poirot,

754
00:36:40,473 --> 00:36:42,700
I'm afraid.

755
00:36:42,968 --> 00:36:45,511

It's my fault.

819
00:40:38,157 --> 00:40:40,006
I should've known.

820
00:40:40,273 --> 00:40:43,084
Pauline always said

821
00:40:43,349 --> 00:40:45,504
she knew something about Iris.

822
00:40:45,772 --> 00:40:48,124
That was why she was killed.

823
00:40:48,426 --> 00:40:51,238
No, Monsieur Russell.

824
00:40:51,503 --> 00:40:54,589
That was not the reason why
Mademoiselle Pauline had to die.

825
00:40:54,849 --> 00:40:56,774
- Then why?
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

826
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,509
That is not the question
we must ask.

827
00:40:59,772 --> 00:41:03,010
We have here two murders.

828
00:41:06,233 --> 00:41:07,896
And in order to solve
the second,

829
00:41:08,157 --> 00:41:12,773
we must return two years
to the first.

830
00:41:14,118 --> 00:41:17,892
Why did Madame Iris Russell
have to die?

831
00:41:18,195 --> 00:41:20,394
So you agree.
She was killed!

832

<i>C'est évident.</i>

833
00:41:23,502 --> 00:41:27,506
And there were perhaps
several reasons.

834
00:41:29,694 --> 00:41:32,003
For example,

835
00:41:32,271 --> 00:41:36,242
she stood in between you
and Monsieur Russell.

836
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:37,897
Between us?
[scoffs]

837
00:41:38,156 --> 00:41:39,742
Ridiculous!

838
00:41:40,002 --> 00:41:41,971
She also stood between
her younger sister

839
00:41:42,271 --> 00:41:44,240
and the great fortune.

840
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,427
Pauline never cared
about the money.

841
00:41:46,694 --> 00:41:48,740
But you care
for Mademoiselle Pauline.

842
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,162
You would not have been happy,
perhaps, to marry an heiress?

843
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:52,781
What?

844
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:56,766
So I killed Iris
so Pauline could inherit?

845
00:41:57,024 --> 00:42:00,206
And finally, she stood
in the way of you, Monsieur.

846
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:03,965
- Me?
- Yes, you, Monsieur Carter.

847
00:42:04,264 --> 00:42:08,634
You and the biggest gamble
of your career.

849
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:17,222

00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:20,745
You'll destroy me!

852
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:22,847
You should've thought of that
before you got involved

853
00:42:23,112 --> 00:42:23,995
in an affair like this.

854
00:42:24,262 --> 00:42:25,842

855
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,059
Nobody knows about it.

856
00:42:27,365 --> 00:42:28,868

Madame Iris Russell spoke?

00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:35,415
There was no affair.

860
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:38,936
No love affair, perhaps,
but the business affair.

861
00:42:39,202 --> 00:42:42,199
Monsieur Carter, I can see
with the eyes of my mind,

862
00:42:42,458 --> 00:42:44,496
and I will speak.

863
00:42:47,975 --> 00:42:49,860
Please show us what you have
in your breast pocket.

864
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,962

do we have a deal?

that was paid,

00:44:28,576 --> 00:44:32,806
and that is why
she had to be silenced!

903
00:44:33,073 --> 00:44:34,384
The daughter of a Labor Peer,

904
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:36,840
could she stand by and watch
as government funds were used

905
00:44:37,108 --> 00:44:38,649
to support the military junta?

906
00:44:38,914 --> 00:44:41,646
Of course not!
And you killed her, Carter.

907
00:44:41,912 --> 00:44:44,611
No.
Wait.

908
00:44:44,871 --> 00:44:48,795
Everything you say is true,
but I didn't kill her.

909
00:44:49,098 --> 00:44:50,409
It was him!

910
00:44:50,674 --> 00:44:52,259
He had as much to lose as me!

911
00:44:52,518 --> 00:44:54,136
But, Monsieur Carter,
you forget

912
00:44:54,401 --> 00:44:55,866
that Monsieur Russell,
he was not even at the table

913
00:44:56,131 --> 00:44:57,792
when the champagne,
it was being served.

914
00:44:58,052 --> 00:44:59,561
- Exactly.
- And tonight also.

915
00:44:59,858 --> 00:45:01,324
Barton was not there.

916
00:45:01,626 --> 00:45:02,555
But wait a minute.

917
00:45:02,818 --> 00:45:04,206
If Carter had put the poison
in Pauline's glass,

918
00:45:04,508 --> 00:45:05,241
I'd have seen him.

919
00:45:05,546 --> 00:45:07,011
I was next to her.

920
00:45:07,275 --> 00:45:08,312
<i>Exactement.</i>

921
00:45:08,313 --> 00:45:09,592
So you mean
he didn't kill her.

922
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:12,507
It was not I who said
that he did.

923
00:45:14,154 --> 00:45:15,236
<i>Merci.</i>

924
00:45:16,383 --> 00:45:18,930
Well, if it wasn't Carter,
who was it?

925
00:45:22,494 --> 00:45:23,773
Who, indeed?

926
00:45:24,031 --> 00:45:28,568
# I've forgotten you #

927
00:45:28,835 --> 00:45:31,764
# I never think of you #

928
00:45:32,024 --> 00:45:33,872
In Buenos Aires,

929
00:45:34,138 --> 00:45:36,608
who could approach the table
with impunity,

930
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:38,987
invisible in the crowd?

931
00:45:39,288 --> 00:45:41,562
Poison a drink,

932
00:45:41,824 --> 00:45:44,448
and at the same time

933
00:45:44,706 --> 00:45:47,745
provide the evidence
of a suicide?

934
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:52,432
And tonight also,

935
00:45:52,738 --> 00:45:56,477
who circled around the table
holding a bottle of champagne?

936
00:45:56,735 --> 00:45:58,123
Only this time,
it was Mademoiselle Pauline

937
00:45:58,425 --> 00:45:59,781
who was to be the victim,

938
00:46:00,039 --> 00:46:03,077
and Monsieur Carter
who was to take the blame.

939
00:46:05,687 --> 00:46:09,337
In the dark, when the attention
of everyone is elsewhere,

940
00:46:09,605 --> 00:46:12,611
seen by everyone and yet unseen,

941
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:14,604
the murderer can plant
the evidence

942
00:46:14,869 --> 00:46:16,759
and then vanish again

943
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:20,255
if he is disguised
as a waiter,

944
00:46:20,555 --> 00:46:22,293
can he not,
Monsieur Russell?

945
00:46:22,553 --> 00:46:24,705
[dramatic orchestral crescendo]

946
00:46:24,973 --> 00:46:26,820
What are you saying?

947
00:46:27,125 --> 00:46:30,436
Why should I have wanted
to kill Pauline?

948
00:46:30,698 --> 00:46:32,162
This evening, I learned
that you are the guardian

949
00:46:32,427 --> 00:46:33,585
of Mademoiselle Pauline

950
00:46:33,887 --> 00:46:36,892
and that you hold her money
in trust until she is 21.

951
00:46:37,152 --> 00:46:38,004
What of it?

952
00:46:38,266 --> 00:46:40,769
That time is to be very soon.

953
00:46:41,033 --> 00:46:43,076
I understand that you have also
suffered huge losses

954
00:46:43,338 --> 00:46:44,955
in the Argentine.

955
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:46,838
I think it will be discovered

956
00:46:47,103 --> 00:46:48,218
that the money
of Mademoiselle Pauline,

957
00:46:48,486 --> 00:46:51,568
it is gone,
and that you have spent it.

958
00:46:55,325 --> 00:46:57,477
This is ridiculous!

959
00:46:57,745 --> 00:46:59,252
I mean, this waiter business.

960
00:46:59,511 --> 00:47:02,056
Are you really telling me
nobody would've noticed?

961
00:47:04,234 --> 00:47:07,729
Did you notice the waitress
who served you with coffee

962
00:47:07,997 --> 00:47:10,881
just a few moments ago?

963
00:47:11,146 --> 00:47:12,500
What?

964
00:47:20,092 --> 00:47:21,097
Pauline.

965
00:47:23,817 --> 00:47:25,247
I don't understand.

966
00:47:25,506 --> 00:47:27,243
How is it possible?

967
00:47:27,503 --> 00:47:29,272
Pauline.

968
00:47:30,613 --> 00:47:32,120
I thought I'd lost you.

969
00:47:33,378 --> 00:47:35,955
Mr. Poirot told me
when he sat next to me.

970
00:47:36,257 --> 00:47:38,529
He said not to touch
the champagne.

971
00:47:38,792 --> 00:47:40,408
I was just to pretend
to drink it

972
00:47:40,673 --> 00:47:43,327
and then pretend
to be dead.

973
00:47:43,591 --> 00:47:48,277
And you played the part
but to perfection, Mademoiselle.

974
00:47:48,544 --> 00:47:49,549
But tell me,
Mademoiselle Pauline,

975
00:47:49,850 --> 00:47:53,618
it was you, was it not,
who sent me the yellow iris?

976
00:47:53,882 --> 00:47:56,230
I was very frightened.

977
00:47:56,531 --> 00:47:58,700
I didn't want to believe it,

978
00:47:58,970 --> 00:48:00,907
but I knew.

979
00:48:01,215 --> 00:48:04,011
I have always known.

980
00:48:04,311 --> 00:48:06,602
And so you called
for Poirot.

981
00:48:06,866 --> 00:48:10,819
And Poirot,
he was there.

982
00:48:13,717 --> 00:48:16,469

00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:27,895
Poirot.

986
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:31,106
Ah, Hastings.

987
00:48:31,407 --> 00:48:33,268
Mon ami.
How did it go?

988
00:48:33,536 --> 00:48:34,780
Well, the case,
it is solved,

989
00:48:35,084 --> 00:48:37,253
and your message, Hastings,
it was most useful.

990
00:48:37,523 --> 00:48:39,306
Oh.
Good.

991
00:48:39,574 --> 00:48:40,940
There is just one thing.

992
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,642
What's that?

993
00:48:42,942 --> 00:48:44,879
With all this affair,
I have not been able to eat.

994
00:48:45,148 --> 00:48:47,439
Oh, I say,
that's a bit rough.

995
00:48:47,741 --> 00:48:49,107
Not going to be easy
finding somewhere

996
00:48:49,367 --> 00:48:50,149
at this time of night.

997
00:48:50,412 --> 00:48:51,612
Oh, that is true.

998
00:48:53,741 --> 00:48:56,417
I do know one place,
though.

999
00:49:03,379 --> 00:49:04,546
English cuisine.

1000
00:49:04,812 --> 00:49:05,593
There's nothing like it
in the world.

1001
00:49:05,857 --> 00:49:08,070
You must agree, Poirot.

1002
00:49:08,334 --> 00:49:10,271
Eh bien, Hastings,
when it is cold and dark,

1003
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:12,170
and there is nothing else
to eat,

1004
00:49:12,437 --> 00:49:15,267
it is...

1005
00:49:15,534 --> 00:49:16,701
passable.
