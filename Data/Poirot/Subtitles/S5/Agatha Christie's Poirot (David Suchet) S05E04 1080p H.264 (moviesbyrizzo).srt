1
00:01:15,792 --> 00:01:20,208
Ten, nine, eight,
seven, six--

2
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,499
- Doctor!

3
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:24,916
Five, four, three,

4
00:01:25,209 --> 00:01:28,041
two, one...

5
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:33,333
- To 1926!

6
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:34,541
Happy New Year!

7
00:01:34,834 --> 00:01:36,749
Happy New Year!

8
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:41,458
- Now, listen, everyone.

9
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,916
Please, please, please.

10
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:46,708
I've been a very fortunate man,

11
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,291
especially to have friends
like all of you.

12
00:01:49,584 --> 00:01:51,249
But not many people
went to Australia

13
00:01:51,542 --> 00:01:53,791
and bought a farm
over a copper seam.

14
00:01:55,417 --> 00:02:00,499
- I have, at long last,
persuaded Andrew to make a will

15
00:02:00,792 --> 00:02:02,458
with my wife Sarah's help.

16
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,458
In it there are several minor
bequests to some of us

17
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,291
and a small trust fund
for Violet's education.

18
00:02:08,584 --> 00:02:09,374
- Violet.

19
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:11,999
- The main part of the estate,
75%,

20
00:02:12,292 --> 00:02:14,458
goes to the Ellen Fort
Medical Foundation.

21
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,666
- Oh, how splendid.

22
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:18,833
- Dr. Pritchard,
of which you are chairman.

23
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:21,791
- It'll be used wisely, Andrew,

24
00:02:22,084 --> 00:02:24,166
if you ever die, that is.

25
00:02:26,167 --> 00:02:28,124
- A lump sum of 2,000 pounds,

26
00:02:28,417 --> 00:02:30,666
held in trust
until their 18th birthdays,

27
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,208
will be shared between
Peter Baker and Robert Siddaway.

28
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,124
- Oh, that's so kind of you,
Andrew.

29
00:02:38,417 --> 00:02:40,624
- I think you know how fond I am
of your son.

30
00:02:40,917 --> 00:02:41,833
And they'll be men soon,

31
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:44,833
with all the responsibility
that entails,

32
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:46,999
and I'd like them
to have a secure future.

33
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:51,583
- What about Violet?

34
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,791
- Well, she is your ward,
Andrew.

35
00:02:54,084 --> 00:02:55,666
You dote on her,
but you've left her nothing.

36
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:57,583
- Sarah, shh.

37
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:00,999
- Yes, but she'll marry,

38
00:03:01,292 --> 00:03:02,416
someone like Robert or Peter.

39
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:03,583
Ew!

40
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,416
- She's a woman,
for heaven's sake.

41
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:07,458
- My God, Andrew.

42
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,291
You had to stop yourself
saying, "only a woman."

43
00:03:33,542 --> 00:03:36,249
- Watch out, whoa!

44
00:03:46,084 --> 00:03:47,541
- Gentlemen.

45
00:03:47,834 --> 00:03:49,833
- Shh, quiet, quiet!

46
00:03:50,792 --> 00:03:53,749
- The motion before us is,
this house believes that women

47
00:03:54,042 --> 00:03:57,708
can never be accorded
equal status with men.

48
00:04:08,792 --> 00:04:12,624
I call upon Mr. Andrew Marsh,
a former president of the union,

49
00:04:12,917 --> 00:04:14,333
to propose the motion.

50
00:04:23,834 --> 00:04:26,999
- Mr. President,
gentlemen...

51
00:04:28,459 --> 00:04:32,374
few people,
if any here today,

52
00:04:32,667 --> 00:04:35,624
would deny
their fellow human beings,

53
00:04:35,917 --> 00:04:39,041
regardless of color, creed,
or gender,

54
00:04:39,334 --> 00:04:42,249
the fundamental right
of respect.

55
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,374
- Ah.
Oh.

56
00:04:54,667 --> 00:04:56,749
- Monsieur Poirot,
it's lovely to see you again,

57
00:04:57,042 --> 00:04:59,041
but we did say 7:00.

58
00:04:59,334 --> 00:05:01,541
- My dear Mademoiselle Violet,
you must forgive me.

59
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:04,166
You must blame the two-inch nail
who punctured us at Baldock.

60
00:05:04,459 --> 00:05:06,249
I'd like you to meet my
associate, Captain Hastings.

61
00:05:06,542 --> 00:05:07,333
- How do you do?

62
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,083
- Captain Hastings, this is
Mademoiselle Violet Wilson,

63
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,958
Andrew's ward.

64
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,958
Thank you.

65
00:05:13,792 --> 00:05:14,874
- But society, like the family,

66
00:05:15,167 --> 00:05:16,874
is not merely a collection
of individuals

67
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:19,583
haphazardly thrown together.

68
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:21,333
In order to function

69
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:24,749
industrially, politically,
socially,

70
00:05:25,042 --> 00:05:29,541
both must be structured, divided
into those who make decisions,

71
00:05:29,834 --> 00:05:30,916
those who put them
into practice,

72
00:05:31,209 --> 00:05:33,999
those who lead,
those who follow.

73
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,708
- This is Miss Campion,
the principal of my college.

74
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,791
- Mademoiselle.

75
00:05:39,042 --> 00:05:40,249
- We really should hurry.

76
00:05:40,542 --> 00:05:43,208
The debate's under way,
and Andrew's already speaking.

77
00:05:44,834 --> 00:05:52,499
- Such designations are status
and are determined by a woman.

78
00:05:56,459 --> 00:05:59,833
Her name is Mother Nature.

79
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:16,541
- Gentlemen, I now call upon
Mr. Robert Siddaway

80
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,708
to oppose the motion.

81
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:31,458
- Mr. President,
the debate so far has ignored

82
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,249
some rather
unpleasant developments

83
00:06:34,542 --> 00:06:38,249
taking place in the real world.

84
00:06:38,542 --> 00:06:43,624
A few months ago,
two leaders of immense status

85
00:06:43,917 --> 00:06:46,416
but with very little respect
for anything,

86
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:50,291
Adolf Hitler
and Benito Mussolini,

87
00:06:50,584 --> 00:06:53,916
overran neighboring countries.

88
00:06:54,209 --> 00:06:58,291
Now, all people of good sense,
regardless of gender,

89
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:02,999
can see that war
right across Europe is imminent.

90
00:07:04,209 --> 00:07:07,958
And when it comes,
will we expect women

91
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,666
to merely keep the home fires
burning, Mr. President...

92
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:11,833
Yes.

93
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,874
Or will be accord them
equal status,

94
00:07:15,167 --> 00:07:18,791
as we ask them to go
onto the land and farm it?

95
00:07:22,834 --> 00:07:25,249
Into the factories
and make munitions?

96
00:07:27,417 --> 00:07:30,333
Join the armed forces
and fight?

97
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:32,458
- Into the valley of death

98
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,666
rode the 500 members
of the women's--

99
00:07:41,042 --> 00:07:44,583
- If you'll let us work
and die for our country,

100
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,291
why won't you let us join
the union?

101
00:07:46,584 --> 00:07:48,999
Or God forbid,
let us speak in a debate.

102
00:07:50,334 --> 00:07:51,333
- Silence!

103
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,166
Silence!

104
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:55,833
I will not allow interruptions
from the gallery!

105
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,416
If it persists,
I shall have it cleared!

106
00:08:00,292 --> 00:08:03,749
- Perhaps you're frightened
we'll start talking sense!

107
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,458
Never mind the outcome, Bobby.

108
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,166
You spoke well.

109
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:22,916
- So did Andrew,

110
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:26,624
once you ignored
what he actually said.

111
00:08:26,917 --> 00:08:28,666
Congratulations, sir.

112
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:30,416
A worthy victory.

113
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:32,999
- Pity the press
won't cover the debate, Robert.

114
00:08:33,292 --> 00:08:35,124
I can see tomorrow's
headlines now:

115
00:08:35,417 --> 00:08:38,749
"New Woman Heckles Hecklers
at Cambridge Union."

116
00:08:42,334 --> 00:08:44,083
Poirot!

117
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:45,166
How are you?

118
00:08:45,417 --> 00:08:46,666
- Andrew, my dear friend.

119
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,666
I missed your speech;
please forgive me.

120
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,083
- Oh, but you've heard the gist
of it many times before,

121
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,791
starting back as far as
The Cavendish Clinic.

122
00:08:54,084 --> 00:08:55,083
- Oh, mon dieu,

123
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,249
in such adversity are born
the lasting friendships,

124
00:08:57,542 --> 00:08:58,499
n'est-ce pas?

125
00:08:58,792 --> 00:08:59,833
We were there, Hastings,

126
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,916
for the mutual pulling
of the wisdom teeth, huh?

127
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,291
- It was not a pretty sight.

128
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:13,874
Damn doctor of mine never offers
me anything for this wheezing.

129
00:09:14,167 --> 00:09:16,166
- Perhaps because you tell him
it does not bother you.

130
00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:18,916
- Blasted man can see it,
now, surely.

131
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:21,958
- Uncle Andrew's
had a wonky heart for years.

132
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:26,124
It leaves him short of breath,
though not of voice.

133
00:09:29,417 --> 00:09:30,791
- This room is a place
most industrious.

134
00:09:31,084 --> 00:09:32,083
Do you not agree, Hastings?

135
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,166
- Certainly, yes.

136
00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:38,541
- I run a magazine, monsieur,
called New Prospects.

137
00:09:38,834 --> 00:09:43,208
I'm hoping to expand it
once I graduate.

138
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:46,791
- Merci.

139
00:09:47,084 --> 00:09:47,874
- Do you have any money?

140
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:48,916
- Oh.

141
00:09:49,167 --> 00:09:50,333
- Violet.

142
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:53,124
- If you won't invest,
Uncle Andrew, I understand that,

143
00:09:53,417 --> 00:09:54,624
but somebody will.

144
00:09:54,917 --> 00:09:57,124
- Have you tried one of the
banks, Mademoiselle Violet?

145
00:09:57,417 --> 00:10:00,166
- Were I a man, they would
give me a loan tomorrow.

146
00:10:00,459 --> 00:10:01,666
- Well,
I told you the reason for that.

147
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:03,208
Women in business
are just begging

148
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,916
to be taken advantage of.

149
00:10:05,209 --> 00:10:06,291
Right, Hastings?

150
00:10:06,584 --> 00:10:08,999
- Ah, can't say I really know
any women...

151
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:10,333
oh, in business, that is.

152
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:13,124
- Point proved;
motion carried.

153
00:10:13,417 --> 00:10:15,416
Three against one, eh, Poirot?

154
00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:17,291
- No, mon ami.

155
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:18,791
Two against two.

156
00:10:20,584 --> 00:10:23,708
Look, I know you've booked
into a hotel, Poirot,

157
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,124
but why don't you join us
for a few days at Crabtree?

158
00:10:27,417 --> 00:10:29,374
Come over tomorrow for lunch.

159
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:32,333
- Well, we should be delighted.

160
00:10:44,042 --> 00:10:45,499
- You will permit me,
Mademoiselle Campion.

161
00:10:45,792 --> 00:10:46,833
- Thank you.

162
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,666
- You like for your students
to have the views

163
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,041
of the very strong,
n'est-ce pas?

164
00:10:50,334 --> 00:10:52,374
- I positively encourage it,
Mr. Poirot.

165
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:54,999
- John, before I forget,
our meeting tomorrow,

166
00:10:55,292 --> 00:10:56,708
could we make it a little later?

167
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,666
- Why don't we meet for lunch?

168
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,416
My office at 12:30.

169
00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:02,208
- It affects you, Martin.

170
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,291
I'm afraid I'm changing my will.

171
00:11:04,584 --> 00:11:05,666
- It's your money, Andrew.

172
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:08,291
- Is Violet to be mentioned
in your new will, sir?

173
00:11:09,417 --> 00:11:11,833
- Setting aside
your impertinence, Robert,

174
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,666
I could've sworn
the debate was over.

175
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,749
Perhaps you feel
I didn't win it convincingly.

176
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,958
- I'm sure he meant no harm,
Andrew.

177
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,624
- You don't merely encourage
the young, Phyllida,

178
00:11:26,917 --> 00:11:28,041
you overindulge them.

179
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,458
- I apologize, sir.

180
00:11:31,209 --> 00:11:32,041
- Robert.

181
00:11:32,334 --> 00:11:33,458
- I'll talk to him,
Mrs. Siddaway.

182
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,541
- Robert!

183
00:11:34,834 --> 00:11:35,916
- Sarah,
will you please not fuss?

184
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:36,999
- Robert!

185
00:11:37,292 --> 00:11:38,083
Robert, wait.

186
00:11:38,334 --> 00:11:39,374
- I'm sorry, Violet,

187
00:11:39,667 --> 00:11:41,499
but just because he won
a stupid debate

188
00:11:41,792 --> 00:11:42,874
doesn't make his attitude right.

189
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:45,208
- Look, he is what he is, Bobby,

190
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,791
and we'll never change him.

191
00:11:48,084 --> 00:11:51,083
And I'm not sure that I want to.

192
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,291
- Well, you can tell your dad

193
00:12:06,584 --> 00:12:07,666
I'll leave
a sack of seed potatoes

194
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:09,083
up by your front drive,
all right?

195
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:10,166
- Yeah.

196
00:12:10,417 --> 00:12:11,583
Thanks for the lift.

197
00:12:19,042 --> 00:12:20,874
- Andrew, it's been marvelous,

198
00:12:21,167 --> 00:12:23,458
but I've quite
an afternoon ahead of me.

199
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,124
- Well, I'm sorry I was rough
on Bobby.

200
00:12:26,417 --> 00:12:28,666
I'll straighten things out
with him later.

201
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,916
- Before I go, Andrew, I'd like
to give you the once-over.

202
00:12:34,209 --> 00:12:35,166
- Oh, good God, man.

203
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:36,458
Fuss, fuss, fuss.

204
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,833
- You've had a couple
of strenuous days.

205
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:42,916
Now, jacket off and sleeves up.

206
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:44,416
- Mrs. Siddaway,
would you be so kind

207
00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:46,624
as to bring my stethoscope
through to the library?

208
00:12:46,917 --> 00:12:49,291
My bag's in the hall.

209
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,499
- Afternoon, Mrs. Siddaway.

210
00:12:56,792 --> 00:12:58,166
- Peter,
what are you doing home?

211
00:12:58,459 --> 00:13:00,374
- Fortnights leave,
then we're off to Palestine.

212
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:02,499
There's no one at the cottage
and Dad's on duty.

213
00:13:02,792 --> 00:13:03,749
I don't suppose Mother's--

214
00:13:04,042 --> 00:13:05,249
- Yes, your mother's
in the kitchen.

215
00:13:05,542 --> 00:13:06,708
Why don't you go and find her?

216
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,791
- Mother!

217
00:13:08,042 --> 00:13:08,916
- Peter!

218
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:30,249
- Entrez.

219
00:13:33,167 --> 00:13:35,958
Ah, mon ami.

220
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,999
The good doctor,
he tells you to get some rest,

221
00:13:38,292 --> 00:13:39,708
and you ignore his advice.

222
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,208
You do not change.

223
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,499
- Oh, I've changed, all right,
Poirot.

224
00:13:43,792 --> 00:13:45,333
You'll think me an old
hypocrite, I'm afraid,

225
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:46,666
saying one thing, doing another.

226
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,958
- I should not dream
of such a thing, mon ami.

227
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,041
Please, do sit.

228
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,166
Even though,
after all the things I've said

229
00:13:57,459 --> 00:13:58,499
about my health over the years,

230
00:13:58,792 --> 00:14:01,124
never taking anyone's advice,

231
00:14:01,417 --> 00:14:02,916
well...

232
00:14:05,167 --> 00:14:07,666
My specialist tells me I--

233
00:14:08,292 --> 00:14:09,999
Oh, damn it,
I'm not afraid of it.

234
00:14:10,292 --> 00:14:11,916
I'm just afraid
of upsetting others.

235
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:16,999
- He tells you that your life
draws to its close?

236
00:14:21,292 --> 00:14:22,666
- En diable.

237
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,791
- You know, ten years ago,
I made a will.

238
00:14:28,792 --> 00:14:33,291
- I have, at long last,
persuaded Andrew to make a will.

239
00:14:33,584 --> 00:14:35,333
- In it,
I left several small bequests:

240
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,416
250 pounds to my lawyer,
John Siddaway,

241
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:41,124
and his wife, Sarah.

242
00:14:41,417 --> 00:14:44,041
Phyllida Campion
receive 500 pounds,

243
00:14:44,334 --> 00:14:47,666
which she immediately pledged
to her college for improvements.

244
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:49,458
My housekeeper, Margaret Baker,

245
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,624
and her husband, Walter,
the local police sergeant,

246
00:14:51,917 --> 00:14:55,541
were already provided for
by an earlier endowment.

247
00:14:55,834 --> 00:14:58,583
Their son, Peter Baker,
and young Robert Siddaway

248
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:02,958
were left 1,000 pounds each
to give them a start in life.

249
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,416
But I left the bulk
of my fortune to Dr. Pritchard,

250
00:15:06,709 --> 00:15:09,458
as chairman of the
Ellen Fort Medical Foundation.

251
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,708
- If you ever die, that is.

252
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,583
- There was some consternation
that night

253
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:17,708
that I had excluded Violet
from my will,

254
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,374
but tomorrow
I'm going to put that right.

255
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:24,833
I intend to write a new will,
leaving everything to Violet.

256
00:15:25,834 --> 00:15:30,249
Truth is, I've been so proud
of her achievements at Cambridge

257
00:15:30,542 --> 00:15:31,333
over the past three years.

258
00:15:31,584 --> 00:15:32,666
She deserves it.

259
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,291
I'd like you to be executor
of that will, Poirot.

260
00:15:39,584 --> 00:15:41,041
Say you'll do it for me.

261
00:15:41,334 --> 00:15:42,791
- But of course.

262
00:15:43,084 --> 00:15:44,499
Why this urgency?

263
00:15:47,084 --> 00:15:49,874
- Who the hell is that
at this time of night?

264
00:15:50,167 --> 00:15:52,666
Look, we'll--we'll talk
more tomorrow.

265
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,833
- Oui, bien sur.

266
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,458
- Good night.

267
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,958
- Bonne nuit, cher ami.

268
00:16:13,417 --> 00:16:15,249
Hello?

269
00:16:18,334 --> 00:16:21,291
What, now?

270
00:16:46,584 --> 00:16:48,833
Couldn't this have waited?

271
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:58,666
- Morning, Poirot.

272
00:16:58,917 --> 00:16:59,708
- Good morning, Hastings.

273
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:00,749
Bonjour, mademoiselle.

274
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,208
- What do you think of Samson?

275
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,666
- I think that he is large, and
you should take care, Hastings.

276
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,166
- We'll join you for breakfast,
Monsieur Poirot.

277
00:17:16,417 --> 00:17:18,166
- What a charming folly.

278
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:20,833
- Andrew restored it
about 15 years ago.

279
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,083
He comes here to think.

280
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:26,749
Race you back.

281
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,666
Come on.

282
00:17:29,959 --> 00:17:31,708
- Wait a minute, Violet.

283
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,874
Andrew?

284
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:07,208
Violet, go back to the house
and get Sergeant Baker

285
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,374
and Poirot too.

286
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,999
- Sergeant Baker,
you permitted I make a search.

287
00:18:27,292 --> 00:18:29,458
- My men have done that, sir.

288
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,041
Found nothing.

289
00:18:31,334 --> 00:18:33,124
- Perhaps a postmortem
will tell us more.

290
00:18:33,417 --> 00:18:35,333
- There's no call
for a postmortem.

291
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,249
I've examined the body.

292
00:18:37,542 --> 00:18:40,583
Andrew died
about eight hours ago.

293
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:43,374
I'll give you
the death certificate.

294
00:19:06,209 --> 00:19:07,708
- Heart failure?

295
00:19:08,959 --> 00:19:10,333
- What's wrong with that?

296
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,124
- It says nothing.

297
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:15,208
I've yet to see a corpse
whose heart still beats.

298
00:19:15,709 --> 00:19:18,791
- Poirot, the leading heart
specialist in London

299
00:19:19,084 --> 00:19:20,041
would tell you that Andrew--

300
00:19:20,334 --> 00:19:21,333
- His illness and I
were well-acquainted,

301
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:22,583
Monsieur Doctor.

302
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:23,791
- It's a bit odd
to be walking around here

303
00:19:24,084 --> 00:19:26,041
in the middle of the night,
though, don't you think?

304
00:19:26,334 --> 00:19:28,708
- He often had a late stroll,
Captain.

305
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,874
It helped him to sleep.

306
00:19:31,167 --> 00:19:33,083
- There you are, Walter.

307
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:49,374
- Last night, Andrew tells me
he was to make a new will.

308
00:19:49,667 --> 00:19:51,791
Half past midnight
he gets a telephone call.

309
00:19:52,084 --> 00:19:55,041
This morning he is dead.

310
00:19:55,334 --> 00:19:57,666
No, this is not coincidence,
Hastings.

311
00:19:59,709 --> 00:20:01,916
We must make the search.

312
00:20:03,209 --> 00:20:07,124
And Hastings,
leave not a rock unturned.

313
00:20:17,292 --> 00:20:18,708
- As your know, Monsieur Poirot,

314
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,999
it's not usual to read
a will before the funeral,

315
00:20:22,292 --> 00:20:24,124
but in this case
I've made an exception,

316
00:20:24,417 --> 00:20:27,958
hoping to dispel your fears
concerning Andrew's death.

317
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,458
- Thank you.

318
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:37,999
- Ladies and gentlemen,
perhaps we should be seated.

319
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:50,083
- Thank you.

320
00:20:53,167 --> 00:20:56,374
- It wasn't a complicated will,
Mr. Poirot.

321
00:20:56,667 --> 00:20:58,791
We were all present
at the witnessing,

322
00:20:59,084 --> 00:21:01,874
ten years ago now.

323
00:21:04,542 --> 00:21:07,083
- The will, Monsieur Siddaway.

324
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,624
- It doesn't appear to be here.

325
00:21:14,917 --> 00:21:15,749
- Don't be absurd, dear.

326
00:21:16,042 --> 00:21:16,958
It must be.

327
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,999
- It's got to be there
somewhere, sir.

328
00:21:19,292 --> 00:21:20,541
Just a matter of finding it.

329
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:29,833
- Madam and monsieur,

330
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:33,791
Andrew Marsh was a good friend
to all of us here in this room,

331
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:37,208
and yet it seems that you wish
his death to pass unquestioned.

332
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,958
- Not all of us, Mr. Poirot.

333
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,499
- And now we have
a disappearing will,

334
00:21:40,792 --> 00:21:42,541
and still you do nothing,
Sergeant.

335
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:46,083
- With respect, Poirot, I think
you're reading too much into it.

336
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:48,458
- Indeed.

337
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,374
The new will that Andrew Marsh
intended to write

338
00:21:51,667 --> 00:21:55,208
would have left everything
to Mademoiselle Violet

339
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,374
with Poirot as executor.

340
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,416
Very well;
I will execute.

341
00:22:00,709 --> 00:22:01,624
But beware, mes amis.

342
00:22:01,917 --> 00:22:03,791
For in so doing,
with or without your help,

343
00:22:04,084 --> 00:22:07,041
I will unravel
the mystery of his death.

344
00:22:17,292 --> 00:22:20,666
This is intolerable, Hastings.

345
00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:22,749
We are dealing
with a close-knit community,

346
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:25,124
where the business of each
is known to all,

347
00:22:25,417 --> 00:22:26,708
except to Poirot.

348
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,249
Yet.

349
00:22:28,542 --> 00:22:29,499
- Just a second, Poirot.

350
00:22:29,792 --> 00:22:31,041
That missing will
could be a godsend.

351
00:22:31,334 --> 00:22:32,499
It'll mean Andrew died
intestate.

352
00:22:32,792 --> 00:22:34,458
- Thank you for
that note of optimism, Hastings.

353
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,374
- But all you have to do
is tell the probate court

354
00:22:36,667 --> 00:22:38,291
that Andrew wanted Violet
to have everything.

355
00:22:38,584 --> 00:22:40,041
- And you think
that they will accept that?

356
00:22:40,334 --> 00:22:42,291
The wishes of Andrew Marsh
told to me in confidence

357
00:22:42,584 --> 00:22:43,958
without any witnesses?

358
00:22:44,709 --> 00:22:46,291
- Oh, I see.

359
00:22:46,584 --> 00:22:47,916
- Uh, Poirot.

360
00:22:48,209 --> 00:22:49,916
I wonder if I might have a word.

361
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,416
- Santé.

362
00:22:53,709 --> 00:22:55,749
- Uh, good health.

363
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:59,458
- I want you to know that
I am the major beneficiary

364
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:00,916
of Andrew's missing will

365
00:23:01,209 --> 00:23:04,374
as chairman
of the Ellen Ford Foundation,

366
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:07,124
in case you get the wrong end
of the stick.

367
00:23:07,417 --> 00:23:10,958
- I have no stick by either end,
Monsieur Doctor.

368
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,666
- Yes,
but you might reasonably think

369
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:15,874
that 75% of the Marsh estate
is worth killing for,

370
00:23:16,167 --> 00:23:18,374
and Andrew was going to make
a new will, you said.

371
00:23:18,667 --> 00:23:20,624
- But you would not have stolen
the old will,

372
00:23:20,917 --> 00:23:22,666
since it favored you.

373
00:23:24,417 --> 00:23:27,208
- Andrew told you he wanted
Violet to have everything,

374
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,874
you said.

375
00:23:29,167 --> 00:23:30,541
- Did he mention nobody else?

376
00:23:30,834 --> 00:23:31,624
- No.

377
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:33,166
Why is it that you ask?

378
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,499
- Because, for a long time now,

379
00:23:36,792 --> 00:23:40,958
I've believed that Andrew
had a son.

380
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:45,833
- Belief, Monsieur Doctor,
is good,

381
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:49,083
but it is not good enough.

382
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:53,541
- Andrew, John, and myself,
we met at Crabtree one night.

383
00:23:53,834 --> 00:23:56,499
It must've been, hmm,
two years ago now.

384
00:23:56,792 --> 00:24:00,708
Sarah was away, and Robert had
just been accepted at Cambridge.

385
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,041
His father was full of it,
bursting with pride.

386
00:24:04,334 --> 00:24:06,208
- To Robert.

387
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,083
- Robert.
- Thank you.

388
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:12,874
- I'm very happy for you, John.

389
00:24:13,167 --> 00:24:15,416
- Oh, forgive me, both of you.

390
00:24:15,709 --> 00:24:20,833
I rattle on as if you fellows
had sons to be proud of as well.

391
00:24:23,209 --> 00:24:28,833
- What makes you think I don't
understand your pride perfectly?

392
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:30,333
You may be my solicitor, John,

393
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:32,749
but you don't know everything
about me.

394
00:24:33,042 --> 00:24:35,083
Does he, Maggie?

395
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:38,624
- Andrew Marsh was always
very fond of Margaret Baker.

396
00:24:38,917 --> 00:24:41,749
Maybe Peter is Andrew's son.

397
00:24:43,167 --> 00:24:44,416
- I see.

398
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,916
Doctor, I thank you.

399
00:24:48,209 --> 00:24:49,958
I have been stumbling around
in a darkened room,

400
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:52,833
and now you have switched on
the light.

401
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:58,166
You see how things go, Hastings?

402
00:24:58,459 --> 00:25:00,416
I believe that he was killed
for his fortune,

403
00:25:00,709 --> 00:25:02,249
but the question still remains:

404
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:04,458
who would lay claim to it
once he had died?

405
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:07,416
- Well, there's that son
that Pritchard talks about.

406
00:25:07,709 --> 00:25:09,583
But then we only have his word
that he exists.

407
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:12,916
- We find the son, mon ami;
we also find the murderer.

408
00:25:13,209 --> 00:25:15,583
Soon we may have the word
of Madam Margaret Baker.

409
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:17,999
- You can't ask a woman
a question like that, Poirot.

410
00:25:18,292 --> 00:25:21,458
- Not only can I, Hastings,
I must.

411
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,166
- Met him in Australia, sir.

412
00:25:23,459 --> 00:25:26,458
He hired me as nanny to Violet,
his business partner's child.

413
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,708
And when he came to England,

414
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,333
he gave me the chance
to come too.

415
00:25:30,625 --> 00:25:32,291
- Which is where you met
your husband,

416
00:25:32,584 --> 00:25:35,916
the bobby of the village.

417
00:25:36,209 --> 00:25:38,833
Madam Baker, I truly wish
to cause you no offense,

418
00:25:39,125 --> 00:25:43,833
but Monsieur Andrew Marsh,
he admired you greatly,

419
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:44,916
n'est-ce pas?

420
00:25:45,167 --> 00:25:48,041
- Well, yes.

421
00:25:48,334 --> 00:25:50,416
- And you were also
very fond of him.

422
00:25:50,709 --> 00:25:52,249
- Yes.

423
00:25:52,542 --> 00:25:53,749
- And perhaps
it would be true to say

424
00:25:54,042 --> 00:25:56,249
that you did not work for him as
a nanny to Mademoiselle Violet

425
00:25:56,542 --> 00:25:58,874
so much as to share in his life?

426
00:26:00,875 --> 00:26:02,416
- I want to hear this.

427
00:26:02,709 --> 00:26:04,874
You're saying I might have
a claim to his fortune,

428
00:26:05,167 --> 00:26:06,083
aren't you, Mr. Poirot?

429
00:26:06,375 --> 00:26:07,791
- Be quiet!

430
00:26:08,084 --> 00:26:10,666
- Dad, you always said Andrew
had an eye for the ladies.

431
00:26:10,959 --> 00:26:13,708
- Yes, well, in my case,
he admired from afar.

432
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,499
After we came back
from Australia,

433
00:26:15,792 --> 00:26:18,666
Mr. Andrew was sent
to fight in France.

434
00:26:18,959 --> 00:26:22,791
You were conceived
while he was away.

435
00:26:23,084 --> 00:26:26,958
By the time Andrew got leave,
Peter was three months old.

436
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,041
- So you worked as the nanny
to Mademoiselle Violet

437
00:26:29,334 --> 00:26:30,999
while Monsieur Andrew,
he was absent?

438
00:26:31,292 --> 00:26:32,374
- Yes.

439
00:26:32,667 --> 00:26:34,624
Well, his other friends
pulled their weight, of course,

440
00:26:34,917 --> 00:26:37,999
but Miss Campion's not much good
with small children,

441
00:26:38,292 --> 00:26:39,416
nor Mrs. Siddaway, come to that,

442
00:26:39,709 --> 00:26:41,208
in spite of being
a children's nurse.

443
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,666
- Ah.

444
00:26:46,625 --> 00:26:48,916
Thank you, madam.

445
00:26:50,917 --> 00:26:52,541
- You got some gall to go
casting suspicions

446
00:26:52,834 --> 00:26:53,999
like that, Poirot.

447
00:26:54,292 --> 00:26:55,999
- I have the gall,
Sergeant Baker,

448
00:26:56,292 --> 00:26:59,999
because a man has been murdered,
and you refuse to investigate.

449
00:27:00,292 --> 00:27:01,541
Very well.

450
00:27:01,834 --> 00:27:05,249
The time has now come for me
to go above your head.

451
00:27:25,709 --> 00:27:28,958
Thank you for coming,
Chief Inspector.

452
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,416
You have met Sergeant Baker,
I see.

453
00:27:30,709 --> 00:27:31,708
- Yes.

454
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,791
I must say, Poirot,
that in spite of your comments,

455
00:27:34,084 --> 00:27:36,333
he seems like
a reliable chap to me.

456
00:27:36,625 --> 00:27:39,041
- This way, Chief Inspector.

457
00:27:53,792 --> 00:27:57,833
Monsieur Marsh was discovered
here, Chief Inspector.

458
00:27:58,125 --> 00:28:00,124
- No marks on the body?

459
00:28:00,417 --> 00:28:01,583
Nothing
out of the ordinary found?

460
00:28:01,875 --> 00:28:03,583
- Rien.

461
00:28:20,917 --> 00:28:23,249
- What's this, then,
if it isn't out of the ordinary?

462
00:28:24,834 --> 00:28:26,833
- C'est incroyable.

463
00:28:27,125 --> 00:28:30,124
- Looks like a medicine bottle
to me.

464
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:33,291
- I myself searched this area
but meticulously.

465
00:28:33,584 --> 00:28:35,708
- Must've missed it, Poirot.

466
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,999
Any of the local quacks
reported one of these missing?

467
00:28:40,292 --> 00:28:41,708
- No, sir.

468
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,791
Sorry, sir.

469
00:28:43,042 --> 00:28:43,874
I'll get onto it right away.

470
00:28:44,167 --> 00:28:46,374
I'll ask Dr. Pritchard.

471
00:28:46,667 --> 00:28:47,916
- Pritchard?

472
00:28:48,209 --> 00:28:51,583
- He's the chairman for the
Ellen Ford Medical Foundation.

473
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:53,416
Dr. Martin Pritchard.

474
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:56,916
- Listen, Poirot.

475
00:28:57,209 --> 00:28:59,374
Don't tell people
I'm in the neighborhood yet.

476
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:03,083
I shall need to see
the coroner's officer.

477
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:04,541
I want a postmortem.

478
00:29:04,834 --> 00:29:07,624
I want to know what was in this.

479
00:29:09,417 --> 00:29:11,833
- Miss Campion, could
you spare us a few moments?

480
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,791
- I am rather pressed for time,
Robert.

481
00:29:14,084 --> 00:29:14,999
- Please, Phyllida.

482
00:29:15,292 --> 00:29:17,416
- It's about my mother,
Miss Campion.

483
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:19,541
About me.

484
00:29:19,792 --> 00:29:21,624
About my father too, I suppose.

485
00:29:21,917 --> 00:29:24,249
- Two years at King's and
you still don't make any sense,

486
00:29:24,542 --> 00:29:26,624
my dear boy,
like so many before you.

487
00:29:26,917 --> 00:29:29,666
- You won't laugh when
you know the reason, Phyllida.

488
00:29:29,959 --> 00:29:32,083
Robert needs your advice.

489
00:29:32,375 --> 00:29:35,666
- I think Andrew Marsh
was my father, Miss Campion.

490
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,374
- And you're asking me
what you should do about it?

491
00:29:40,667 --> 00:29:43,291
Why don't you ask Mr. Poirot?

492
00:29:49,459 --> 00:29:52,416
- But Robert, why didn't
you mention this before today?

493
00:29:52,709 --> 00:29:56,124
- My mother only told me
about it last night.

494
00:29:56,417 --> 00:29:58,499
It took some guts on her part.

495
00:29:58,792 --> 00:30:01,958
- It doesn't seem to have
upset you unduly, Robert.

496
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:06,833
- Well, after some thought,
what difference does it make?

497
00:30:09,209 --> 00:30:13,124
- Bien, Monsieur Robert,
I will tell you the difference.

498
00:30:13,417 --> 00:30:16,291
In the will that is missing,
you inherit a small fortune.

499
00:30:16,584 --> 00:30:17,958
If you can prove
you are his son,

500
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,833
you will inherit a vast one.

501
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,916
- And now,
a son by Sarah Siddaway.

502
00:30:37,209 --> 00:30:40,333
We find the son,
we find the murderer, you said.

503
00:30:40,625 --> 00:30:42,541
- Yes, indeed, Hastings.

504
00:30:42,834 --> 00:30:44,541
But it would be unseemly
to unmask him

505
00:30:44,834 --> 00:30:47,999
the day before the funeral
of Andrew Marsh.

506
00:30:59,084 --> 00:31:01,583
- The man had a lot of friends,
Poirot.

507
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:03,333
- What good are many friends,
mon ami,

508
00:31:03,625 --> 00:31:06,958
when you have one bad enemy?

509
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:17,833
- Doctor Pritchard.

510
00:31:23,917 --> 00:31:27,291
- You look to be in the rudest
of health, Chief Inspector.

511
00:31:27,584 --> 00:31:30,124
- You have met before?

512
00:31:30,417 --> 00:31:32,333
- Would you care to fill
these gentlemen in, sir,

513
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:35,333
or shall I?

514
00:31:35,625 --> 00:31:36,791
Very well, then.

515
00:31:37,084 --> 00:31:39,541
We met in London 15 years ago.

516
00:31:39,834 --> 00:31:41,374
Doctor Pritchard here
was running

517
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:45,666
a so-called humanitarian group
helping the terminally ill...

518
00:31:46,334 --> 00:31:47,291
to kill themselves.

519
00:31:47,584 --> 00:31:49,166
- To end their suffering,
you mean.

520
00:31:49,459 --> 00:31:50,958
- We investigated
his organization,

521
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:52,958
but couldn't prove anything.

522
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:55,833
At a rough guess, I'd say
he's up to his old tricks again.

523
00:31:56,125 --> 00:31:57,249
- No.

524
00:31:57,542 --> 00:32:01,124
- Yours, Doctor,
according the manufacturer.

525
00:32:01,417 --> 00:32:03,749
They send them out
with batches of insulin--

526
00:32:04,042 --> 00:32:07,416
all numbered
so they can keep tabs on them.

527
00:32:07,709 --> 00:32:09,499
Because as well
as working miracles,

528
00:32:09,792 --> 00:32:11,958
insulin can also be lethal.

529
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:13,833
- I don't understand.

530
00:32:14,125 --> 00:32:18,708
- The postmortem found needle
marks in Mr. Marsh's upper arm.

531
00:32:20,542 --> 00:32:21,583
Martin Arthur Pritchard,

532
00:32:21,875 --> 00:32:24,583
I'm arresting you
for the murder of Andrew Marsh.

533
00:32:24,875 --> 00:32:26,083
You're not obliged
to say anything,

534
00:32:26,375 --> 00:32:29,874
but anything you do say will be
taken down and used in evidence.

535
00:32:38,584 --> 00:32:41,208
All things come to he who waits,
Poirot.

536
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,958
I knew I'd get him
sooner or later.

537
00:32:57,584 --> 00:33:00,083
- Just because the solution
to a crime is simple, Poirot,

538
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:01,624
doesn't mean to say it's wrong.

539
00:33:01,917 --> 00:33:04,499
Pritchard killed Andrew Marsh,
end of story.

540
00:33:04,792 --> 00:33:06,374
- But why would he steal a will
that favored him?

541
00:33:06,667 --> 00:33:07,874
No, Chief Inspector.

542
00:33:08,167 --> 00:33:12,583
Still it has not been found,
nor, I believe, will it ever be.

543
00:33:12,875 --> 00:33:13,999
Did you question other suspects?

544
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:15,416
Did Sergeant Baker?

545
00:33:15,709 --> 00:33:17,874
- Of course we didn't,
because there weren't any.

546
00:33:19,167 --> 00:33:22,749
- Robert Siddaway
and Violet Wilson.

547
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,958
Monsieur Poirot is expecting us.

548
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:27,083
- What about that
telephone call, Chief Inspector,

549
00:33:27,375 --> 00:33:28,958
the one that Andrew
received at gone midnight?

550
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,458
- Pritchard, of course.

551
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,666
Honestly, you two, when
you're backed into a corner--

552
00:33:32,959 --> 00:33:35,374
- Miss Wilson and Mr. Siddaway.

553
00:33:35,667 --> 00:33:38,999
- Monsieur Poirot, we thought
you should be the first to know.

554
00:33:39,292 --> 00:33:40,916
We're going to America.

555
00:33:41,209 --> 00:33:43,499
Robert's going to forego
his last year at King's,

556
00:33:43,792 --> 00:33:46,416
and there's a berth on the
Queen Mary leaving on Tuesday.

557
00:33:46,709 --> 00:33:49,791
- Mademoiselle Violet,
Monsieur Robert.

558
00:33:50,084 --> 00:33:51,833
Please, do sit.

559
00:33:59,084 --> 00:34:00,999
Et bien, mademoiselle.

560
00:34:01,292 --> 00:34:03,083
What of the end of term?

561
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:06,791
What of the graduation ceremony
of Mademoiselle Campion?

562
00:34:07,084 --> 00:34:09,458
- Why the sudden rush,
Miss Wilson?

563
00:34:10,459 --> 00:34:12,333
- What is there to stay for?

564
00:34:12,625 --> 00:34:15,166
Women are treated as equals
in America.

565
00:34:15,459 --> 00:34:18,249
I can forge myself
a decent career.

566
00:34:18,542 --> 00:34:24,083
And a man I've known all my life
is charged, quite insanely,

567
00:34:24,375 --> 00:34:27,416
with my guardian's murder.

568
00:34:27,709 --> 00:34:30,083
- Mademoiselle Violet,
your late guardian

569
00:34:30,375 --> 00:34:32,999
would not have wanted you
to miss the graduation ceremony.

570
00:34:34,834 --> 00:34:36,208
Now, I beg of you,

571
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,083
before you finally
make up your mind,

572
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:43,499
to give Poirot
a little more time, please.

573
00:34:55,417 --> 00:34:56,541
- It's all very well,

574
00:34:56,834 --> 00:34:59,583
you saying probate's
a lengthy business, John,

575
00:34:59,875 --> 00:35:02,874
but Robert and Violet are
planning to leave the country.

576
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:03,958
Do you want that?

577
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,416
- No, of course, I don't.

578
00:35:06,709 --> 00:35:09,374
- Is it that difficult to prove
you're someone's heir?

579
00:35:09,667 --> 00:35:11,791
I mean, what does it involve?

580
00:35:12,084 --> 00:35:13,499
- Surprisingly little.

581
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:16,916
You swear an oath that you are
who you say you are.

582
00:35:17,209 --> 00:35:19,333
- Don't you need a
birth certificate or something?

583
00:35:19,625 --> 00:35:21,624
- No.

584
00:35:21,917 --> 00:35:24,499
- Would you apologize
to Sarah for me?

585
00:35:24,792 --> 00:35:26,416
She's invited me to dinner
on Saturday,

586
00:35:26,709 --> 00:35:27,916
but I'm going to London.

587
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,249
- I'll tell Sarah.

588
00:35:30,542 --> 00:35:31,958
Theater, concert?

589
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:33,208
- No.

590
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,999
To see Hercule Poirot,
as a matter of fact.

591
00:35:37,292 --> 00:35:40,249
I need his advice on something.

592
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:07,624
- Oh, beg your pardon.

593
00:36:26,042 --> 00:36:27,916
- Oh!

594
00:36:31,459 --> 00:36:33,624
- Someone, stop!

595
00:36:36,459 --> 00:36:38,708
- Whoever pushed Mademoiselle
Campion down the moving stairs,

596
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,791
it was not Dr. Pritchard.

597
00:36:40,042 --> 00:36:41,249
He is in your custody.

598
00:36:41,542 --> 00:36:43,416
- Yes, well, we don't know
that anyone pushed her yet.

599
00:36:43,709 --> 00:36:45,499
- But he is not the murderer,
Chief Inspector.

600
00:36:45,792 --> 00:36:47,666
The murderer is still at large.

601
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:55,166
- Well, they obviously
got her here pretty quickly.

602
00:36:55,459 --> 00:36:57,958
At least we know she survived.

603
00:37:00,875 --> 00:37:01,666
- Thank you, nurse.

604
00:37:01,959 --> 00:37:02,874
- Police.

605
00:37:03,167 --> 00:37:04,416
I shall need to speak
with Miss Campion

606
00:37:04,709 --> 00:37:05,583
as soon as possible.

607
00:37:05,875 --> 00:37:07,999
- Well, you can't;
she's concussed.

608
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:09,749
Very nasty fall, gentlemen.

609
00:37:10,042 --> 00:37:11,291
Leg's broken in two places.

610
00:37:11,584 --> 00:37:12,958
- She will recover soon?

611
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:14,458
- I think you'll find
Mrs. Campion's

612
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:16,083
made of pretty strong stuff.

613
00:37:16,375 --> 00:37:18,083
- She's a miss, Doctor.

614
00:37:18,375 --> 00:37:20,749
Miss Campion.

615
00:37:21,042 --> 00:37:23,208
You called her "missus."

616
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:27,999
- You, uh, know her well?

617
00:37:28,292 --> 00:37:29,249
- Well...

618
00:37:29,542 --> 00:37:31,916
- No,
but we know she's not married.

619
00:37:32,209 --> 00:37:33,874
- Tell me, Doctor,

620
00:37:34,167 --> 00:37:36,416
did you call her "missus"
out of habit

621
00:37:36,709 --> 00:37:38,958
or a slip of the tongue?

622
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:40,666
- Look, I'm sorry.

623
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:42,874
I-I didn't mean to speak
out of turn, but--

624
00:37:43,167 --> 00:37:45,041
- If there's something you know,
Doctor,

625
00:37:45,334 --> 00:37:48,624
it's your duty to tell us.

626
00:37:48,917 --> 00:37:52,958
- Miss Campion has had a baby
at some time in her life...

627
00:37:53,917 --> 00:37:56,499
by cesarean section, no less.

628
00:38:03,709 --> 00:38:07,666
- Miss Lemon,
I have a task for you.

629
00:39:18,167 --> 00:39:21,333
- Ladies and gentlemen...

630
00:39:23,084 --> 00:39:25,083
The end of the academic year

631
00:39:25,375 --> 00:39:29,708
is something
I would never miss,

632
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,041
although this time,
it was a close-run thing.

633
00:39:34,209 --> 00:39:37,874
As you know, this is always
an informal occasion,

634
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:40,499
because while the university
here at Cambridge

635
00:39:40,792 --> 00:39:44,166
acknowledges the hard work
of its male students,

636
00:39:44,459 --> 00:39:49,083
it doesn't yet see fit to hold
a degree ceremony for women.

637
00:39:49,375 --> 00:39:51,249
So I hold my own.

638
00:39:54,375 --> 00:39:55,499
- Bravo!

639
00:39:59,334 --> 00:40:02,541
- And as you take your places
in society,

640
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:05,749
I hope that three years here

641
00:40:06,042 --> 00:40:09,708
will have proved you
more than worthy of them.

642
00:40:41,584 --> 00:40:43,874
- Thank you, Hastings.

643
00:40:44,167 --> 00:40:45,833
A smile of triumph,
Miss Lemon.

644
00:40:46,125 --> 00:40:47,666
- Of course.

645
00:41:03,834 --> 00:41:04,749
- Madames et monsieurs...

646
00:41:05,042 --> 00:41:06,208
- Shh.

647
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,083
- To begin,
I think it is fitting

648
00:41:08,375 --> 00:41:11,916
that we should make a toast
to our dear, late friend,

649
00:41:12,209 --> 00:41:14,249
Monsieur Andrew Marsh.

650
00:41:14,542 --> 00:41:16,874
- Andrew Marsh.

651
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:26,666
- Today would've given him
much pleasure, n'est-ce pas?

652
00:41:26,959 --> 00:41:30,874
And how proud
he would've been of you,

653
00:41:31,167 --> 00:41:31,958
Mademoiselle Violet.

654
00:41:37,209 --> 00:41:39,874
However,
there is someone in this room

655
00:41:40,167 --> 00:41:43,166
who denied to him this pleasure.

656
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:46,916
- You mean,
his murderer is here?

657
00:41:47,209 --> 00:41:48,666
One of us?

658
00:41:53,792 --> 00:41:56,791
- On the night that he died,

659
00:41:57,084 --> 00:41:59,874
Monsieur Andrew Marsh asked me
to be the executor

660
00:42:00,167 --> 00:42:01,416
of a new will he would make.

661
00:42:03,667 --> 00:42:07,833
I believe he was killed
for that fortune,

662
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:10,333
and that the old will
was stolen and destroyed

663
00:42:10,625 --> 00:42:12,874
so that he would die intestate.

664
00:42:15,125 --> 00:42:18,874
So my duty, you see,
it has been twofold.

665
00:42:19,167 --> 00:42:21,583
First, to find the murderer,

666
00:42:21,875 --> 00:42:24,999
and then, before this ruthless
murderer could lay claim to it,

667
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:26,916
to deliver his estate
to Mademoiselle Violet,

668
00:42:27,209 --> 00:42:28,708
according to his wishes.

669
00:42:30,959 --> 00:42:34,416
However, this murderer,
he was at work

670
00:42:34,709 --> 00:42:38,749
even as my dear friend Andrew
told to me his news most tragic.

671
00:42:39,042 --> 00:42:41,999
- My specialist tells me I--

672
00:42:42,292 --> 00:42:43,666
Oh, damn it,
I'm not afraid of it.

673
00:42:43,959 --> 00:42:45,749
I'm just afraid
of upsetting others.

674
00:42:48,042 --> 00:42:50,791
Who the hell is that
at this time of night?

675
00:42:51,084 --> 00:42:53,041
Hello?

676
00:42:53,334 --> 00:42:56,458
What, now?

677
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,541
- And thus, the murderer
lured him from the house...

678
00:43:03,834 --> 00:43:05,999
- Couldn't this have waited?

679
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,249
To a rendezvous at the folly.

680
00:43:15,417 --> 00:43:17,208
- Ah!

681
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,666
- And here,
our murderer administered

682
00:43:19,959 --> 00:43:22,499
a massive and fatal dose
of insulin,

683
00:43:22,792 --> 00:43:27,874
in a cowardly attack upon
a man who was sick and weakened.

684
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:35,874
And voilà.

685
00:43:38,125 --> 00:43:39,791
Hmm.

686
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:45,374
But then along comes Poirot,
who says that this death

687
00:43:45,667 --> 00:43:47,083
is not a death that is natural.

688
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:49,333
Oh, no.

689
00:43:49,625 --> 00:43:51,749
It is a murder.

690
00:43:52,042 --> 00:43:55,958
So fearing for their own safety,
the murderer pointed the finger

691
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:57,958
toward Dr. Martin Pritchard,

692
00:43:58,250 --> 00:43:59,749
by placing
at the scene of the crime

693
00:44:00,042 --> 00:44:02,708
the vial containing the insulin.

694
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,374
Chief Inspector Japp arrives to
help me with the investigation,

695
00:44:05,667 --> 00:44:08,291
he examines the folly,
and he finds it there.

696
00:44:08,584 --> 00:44:10,791
Why was that vial not found
the day of the murder

697
00:44:11,084 --> 00:44:14,624
by Sergeant Baker, huh?

698
00:44:14,917 --> 00:44:16,541
Because it was not there.

699
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:20,083
No.

700
00:44:20,375 --> 00:44:22,374
Poirot himself
searched the area,

701
00:44:22,667 --> 00:44:24,874
and Poirot never misses.

702
00:44:25,875 --> 00:44:27,999
So my good friend
the Chief Inspector Japp

703
00:44:28,292 --> 00:44:31,916
promptly arrests
Dr. Martin Pritchard.

704
00:44:32,209 --> 00:44:35,041
And with a man who is innocent
charged for the murder,

705
00:44:35,334 --> 00:44:40,833
the real killer could now
lay claim to the Marsh fortune,

706
00:44:41,125 --> 00:44:43,541
so it was thought,

707
00:44:43,834 --> 00:44:46,874
without suspicion.

708
00:44:47,167 --> 00:44:49,833
But Dr. Martin Pritchard
had already told

709
00:44:50,125 --> 00:44:53,666
to my associate Captain Hastings
and myself

710
00:44:53,959 --> 00:44:57,041
that Andrew had a son.

711
00:45:03,334 --> 00:45:04,833
Peter, perhaps?

712
00:45:05,125 --> 00:45:10,249
- That doesn't mean to say
I'd kill him for it.

713
00:45:10,542 --> 00:45:13,458
- Or you, Robert.

714
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:17,208
Now, your claim had to it
more substance, n'est-ce pas?

715
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,624
Because you believed that
Andrew Marsh and your mother

716
00:45:19,917 --> 00:45:21,583
were lovers.

717
00:45:24,125 --> 00:45:26,499
- Robert was with me
the night of Andrew's death,

718
00:45:26,792 --> 00:45:27,583
Monsieur Poirot.

719
00:45:27,834 --> 00:45:28,791
- Violet, don't.

720
00:45:29,084 --> 00:45:30,666
- Was the arm that pushed
Mademoiselle Campion

721
00:45:30,959 --> 00:45:33,999
down the moving stairs yours,
Peter?

722
00:45:34,292 --> 00:45:35,083
Yours, Robert?

723
00:45:39,959 --> 00:45:42,124
- Someone, stop!

724
00:45:42,417 --> 00:45:44,958
- Were you afraid
of what she might say to me?

725
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:47,458
- Theater, concert?

726
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:49,083
- No.

727
00:45:49,375 --> 00:45:52,999
To see Hercule Poirot,
as a matter of fact.

728
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:54,749
- And, of course,
the killer certainly knew

729
00:45:55,042 --> 00:45:57,374
of the visit to London
of Mademoiselle Campion

730
00:45:57,667 --> 00:46:01,583
to see Poirot,

731
00:46:01,875 --> 00:46:05,499
because Mademoiselle Campion
had discovered in a conversation

732
00:46:05,792 --> 00:46:07,166
with the lawyer John Siddaway

733
00:46:07,459 --> 00:46:09,333
that for a child to claim
the estate of the father,

734
00:46:09,625 --> 00:46:14,458
the real identity of the mother
need not to be revealed.

735
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:18,458
But events took such a turn
that did reveal a secret

736
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:23,499
that she herself had kept
for more than, what, 20 years?

737
00:46:27,709 --> 00:46:34,083
- What Mr. Poirot means is that
the doctor who treated me

738
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:37,749
saw that I'd had a baby...

739
00:46:40,959 --> 00:46:43,499
when I was a student here.

740
00:46:47,584 --> 00:46:51,291
- It was but a short step
for my secretary Miss Lemon

741
00:46:51,584 --> 00:46:53,333
to discover the name
of that baby.

742
00:46:55,667 --> 00:46:57,249
Please do read it, Miss Lemon.

743
00:46:58,542 --> 00:47:05,083
- "Born on the 17th of July,
1913, to Miss Phyllida Campion,

744
00:47:05,375 --> 00:47:07,916
the daughter whose name
was Violet."

745
00:47:12,167 --> 00:47:15,666
- What's going on?

746
00:47:15,959 --> 00:47:19,208
What on earth is happening?

747
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:23,124
- Was it necessary to pry
into Phyllida's past, Poirot?

748
00:47:23,417 --> 00:47:25,124
It's Andrew we're interested in.

749
00:47:25,417 --> 00:47:26,958
- Yes, indeed.

750
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:28,249
But during all this time,

751
00:47:28,542 --> 00:47:30,291
not once did we ask ourselves
this question:

752
00:47:30,584 --> 00:47:33,624
is this son that we seek...

753
00:47:36,125 --> 00:47:38,499
perhaps a daughter?

754
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:45,124
- So Violet
is Andrew Marsh's daughter?

755
00:47:48,584 --> 00:47:49,999
- Yes.

756
00:47:57,625 --> 00:48:01,874
- So Monsieur Robert,
why did you kill the father

757
00:48:02,167 --> 00:48:03,333
to Mademoiselle Violet?

758
00:48:03,625 --> 00:48:04,541
- I didn't.

759
00:48:04,834 --> 00:48:06,374
- I say you did, monsieur!

760
00:48:06,667 --> 00:48:08,291
Why?

761
00:48:08,584 --> 00:48:10,333
You know that she loves you.

762
00:48:10,625 --> 00:48:12,458
You know that she wants you
to go to America with her.

763
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:13,541
Why, then?

764
00:48:13,792 --> 00:48:15,833
- He's just told you he didn't!

765
00:48:20,542 --> 00:48:22,874
- No, madam.

766
00:48:23,167 --> 00:48:26,958
Perhaps Robert,
he is not the murderer.

767
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,458
Because, just as we thought the
heir of Andrew had to be a man,

768
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:40,458
so too did we think
of the murderer.

769
00:48:43,375 --> 00:48:46,541
This killer was someone
who stole a syringe

770
00:48:46,834 --> 00:48:49,624
from the bag belonging
to Dr. Pritchard,

771
00:48:49,917 --> 00:48:52,833
who knew the power of insulin.

772
00:48:54,834 --> 00:48:59,208
And you, I was told,
had been a children's nurse,

773
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:00,999
Madam Siddaway.

774
00:49:03,875 --> 00:49:06,374
It was you
who convinced Robert

775
00:49:06,667 --> 00:49:07,708
that he was the son of Andrew.

776
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,249
It was Robert who told you
of the visit

777
00:49:09,542 --> 00:49:10,791
of Mademoiselle Campion
to London,

778
00:49:11,084 --> 00:49:12,041
where you followed her,

779
00:49:12,334 --> 00:49:14,708
where you pushed her down
the moving stairs.

780
00:49:18,209 --> 00:49:19,333
- Somebody get help!

781
00:49:19,625 --> 00:49:22,833
- Because you are afraid
that at last

782
00:49:23,125 --> 00:49:25,208
she would reveal
Mademoiselle Violet

783
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:26,999
as the rightful heir.

784
00:49:29,209 --> 00:49:30,999
- No.

785
00:49:36,542 --> 00:49:38,124
- John, help me.

786
00:49:41,209 --> 00:49:43,124
- There's nothing I can do,
Sarah.

787
00:49:44,292 --> 00:49:46,916
- How did you know about Violet?

788
00:49:49,792 --> 00:49:51,541
- I had a friend
who worked in the clinic.

789
00:49:51,834 --> 00:49:53,874
I met her years later.

790
00:49:57,375 --> 00:50:00,166
There was so little
we had to give Robert.

791
00:50:00,459 --> 00:50:03,374
- But he was mentioned
in the will, madam.

792
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:06,999
Well, why did you steal
and destroy it?

793
00:50:07,292 --> 00:50:10,374
- Because I wanted him
to have everything!

794
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:13,791
Why should it all go to Violet?

795
00:50:14,084 --> 00:50:18,166
- Because Andrew Marsh
wished it

796
00:50:18,459 --> 00:50:21,874
as proof
that she was his daughter...

797
00:50:25,042 --> 00:50:26,958
and his equal.

798
00:50:32,917 --> 00:50:36,291
- I think you'd better come
along with me, Mrs. Siddaway.

799
00:50:47,542 --> 00:50:48,499
- Ah!

800
00:50:48,792 --> 00:50:51,416
Mademoiselle Campion,
Mademoiselle Violet.

801
00:50:51,709 --> 00:50:54,583
Your magazine could not
have a name that is better, huh?

802
00:50:54,875 --> 00:50:56,333
The New Prospects,

803
00:50:56,625 --> 00:50:59,041
for these are very exciting
for you both, are they not?

804
00:50:59,334 --> 00:51:00,458
- They certainly are.

805
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:02,666
And I'm going to use
the inheritance

806
00:51:02,959 --> 00:51:04,333
to start my own
publishing company.

807
00:51:04,625 --> 00:51:05,833
- Ah!

808
00:51:06,125 --> 00:51:09,708
- And you, Monsieur Poirot,
shall be my first subscriber.

809
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,499
- Thank you, mademoiselle.

810
00:51:12,792 --> 00:51:16,249
You know, the companies,
they have a chairman, huh?

811
00:51:16,542 --> 00:51:19,083
But in this instance,
why not a chairwoman?

812
00:51:19,375 --> 00:51:21,083
You already have a chair, I see.

813
00:51:21,375 --> 00:51:22,666
- Not for much longer.

814
00:51:22,959 --> 00:51:25,541
Plaster comes off
a week today.

815
00:51:25,834 --> 00:51:27,291
- And what of Robert?

816
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:31,083
- I think I can persuade him
to finish his degree.

817
00:51:31,834 --> 00:51:34,666
- That is good.

818
00:51:34,959 --> 00:51:39,083
Alors au revoir, mademoiselle.

819
00:51:41,292 --> 00:51:44,624
Et bonne chance.

820
00:51:44,917 --> 00:51:47,249
- Thank you, Monsieur Poirot.
