1
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:19,041
- The pyramids of Egypt,

2
00:01:19,334 --> 00:01:23,041
the last surviving of
the seven wonders of the world.

3
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:27,499
The latest expedition by famous
archaeologist Sir John Willard

4
00:01:27,792 --> 00:01:30,791
may soon reveal more of this
ancient world's mysteries

5
00:01:31,084 --> 00:01:35,583
with the discovery of the tomb
of Egyptian king Men-her-Ra.

6
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:39,041
No doubt there will be rivalry
between Dr. Fosswell

7
00:01:39,334 --> 00:01:41,041
of the British Museum

8
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:43,458
and Dr. Schneider
of the Metropolitan Museum

9
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:44,749
of New York,

10
00:01:45,042 --> 00:01:47,083
but keep it friendly,
eh, chaps?

11
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:50,416
The local workers
fear of a death curse

12
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:54,541
laid down on the tomb
over 3,000 years ago.

13
00:01:54,834 --> 00:01:58,458
Hasn't scared off expedition
financier Felix Bleibner.

14
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,541
He's been joined for the opening
by his nephew Rupert

15
00:02:01,834 --> 00:02:06,041
and secretary Nigel Harper,
photographing the occasion.

16
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,291
Smile, Men-her-Ra.

17
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:17,499
- It's gonna take us some time

18
00:02:17,792 --> 00:02:20,166
to get the seal off intact,
Sir John.

19
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:22,583
- No, no, no.
Break the seal.

20
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:24,958
- It'll only take five minutes,
John.

21
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,749
- For God's sake, Mr. Bleibner--

22
00:02:27,042 --> 00:02:30,874
- That seal hasn't been broken
for over 3,000 years.

23
00:02:31,167 --> 00:02:32,499
- Then it's time it was.

24
00:02:38,542 --> 00:02:39,374
Gentlemen,

25
00:02:39,667 --> 00:02:43,374
the burial chamber
of King Men-her-Ra.

26
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:40,666
- Dr. Ames, quickly.
He's ill.

27
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:05,249
- Tragedy strikes
in the Valley of the Kings.

28
00:04:05,542 --> 00:04:08,374
Just minutes after
breaking into the ancient tomb

29
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:10,624
of Egyptian pharaoh Men-her-Ra,

30
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:14,499
eminent archaeologist
Sir John Willard is struck down

31
00:04:14,792 --> 00:04:16,458
by a fatal heart attack.

32
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,958
Local rumors of an ancient curse
on all those who enter the tomb

33
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,791
have been dismissed
as preposterous.

34
00:04:41,667 --> 00:04:43,208
- Any messages, Miss Lemon?

35
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,541
- No, Mr. Poirot.
No.

36
00:04:45,834 --> 00:04:47,208
Oh, yes.
One.

37
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,333
Lady Willard telephoned.

38
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:50,999
She wants to consult you.

39
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:52,541
- Huh.

40
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,999
- I know.

41
00:04:56,292 --> 00:04:57,708
Isn't it awful?

42
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,291
Does seem almost as if
something were avenging itself

43
00:05:01,584 --> 00:05:03,416
for desecrating the tomb.

44
00:05:15,209 --> 00:05:16,458
- Bonjour, mademoiselle.

45
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,708
I am expected.

46
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,083
- Do come in.
- Thank you.

47
00:05:28,792 --> 00:05:30,041
Merci.

48
00:05:30,334 --> 00:05:31,999
- My son has always been against

49
00:05:32,292 --> 00:05:35,041
my calling on your assistance,
Monsieur Poirot.

50
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:38,624
He thinks I'm listening to all
this silly talk about a curse.

51
00:05:38,917 --> 00:05:42,333
But my husband's death came
as a very great shock to me.

52
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:43,458
- Yes, of course.

53
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,708
- And now my son wishes
to go out to Egypt

54
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,874
to continue his father's work.

55
00:05:50,167 --> 00:05:53,374
I cannot tell you why,
Monsieur Poirot.

56
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:57,708
This whole enterprise
has filled me with foreboding.

57
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,666
It's all those Americans,
all those young men from Yale.

58
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:05,124
Seems they've been trying
to take over the dig

59
00:06:05,417 --> 00:06:06,583
right from the start.

60
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:07,916
- Mother, really.

61
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:11,916
Mr. Bleibner put up the money
for the entire show,

62
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:13,833
and without him,
there wouldn't be any dig.

63
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,458
- Well, I never trusted
Felix Bleibner.

64
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,333
He's just a wealthy dabbler.

65
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,166
I see he's got his nephew up
in there too.

66
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:21,833
- Rupert's only there
to visit his uncle.

67
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:27,499
- Excuse me, Lady Willard,
how may I be of service to you?

68
00:06:27,792 --> 00:06:29,999
I imagine that there is no doubt
that the death of your husband

69
00:06:30,292 --> 00:06:32,041
was from the causes
quite natural.

70
00:06:32,334 --> 00:06:34,333
- Well...

71
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,041
- No doubt at all.

72
00:06:36,334 --> 00:06:38,208
I'm so sorry.

73
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,291
It appears we've
wasted your time,

74
00:06:41,584 --> 00:06:43,416
Mr. Poirot.

75
00:07:06,417 --> 00:07:07,666
- I gave him
a thorough examination

76
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:09,291
before we came out here.

77
00:07:09,584 --> 00:07:11,083
His heart was sound as a bell.

78
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:16,541
It is weird, though, isn't it?

79
00:07:16,834 --> 00:07:19,916
I mean, just the very instant
the burial chamber was opened?

80
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:22,124
- Well, I don't care about
any rotten curse.

81
00:07:22,417 --> 00:07:24,416
I'm off to New York on Thursday.

82
00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:25,749
- When's the happy day?

83
00:07:26,042 --> 00:07:27,499
- 14th of next month,

84
00:07:27,792 --> 00:07:29,999
unless Bob saves my life again.

85
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:34,083
- He really did save
my life once, you know?

86
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:35,666
- No kidding?

87
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:37,749
- I can save you
from poor seamanship, Rupert,

88
00:07:38,042 --> 00:07:39,958
but I'm no good
on impending marriages.

89
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,916
- You three were together
at Yale, right?

90
00:07:45,209 --> 00:07:49,874
- God, does that seem
an age ago.

91
00:07:50,167 --> 00:07:53,249
- Who's going to take over
the excavation, do you think?

92
00:07:53,542 --> 00:07:55,999
- Well, that kind of depends
on your uncle.

93
00:07:56,292 --> 00:07:57,083
He is the money.

94
00:07:57,334 --> 00:07:58,208
- Do I get the impression

95
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,083
that Dr. Fosswell
would not be averse?

96
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:05,291
- Sure, the British Museum
has got to be in the running.

97
00:08:07,417 --> 00:08:08,666
- And what about
the Metropolitan?

98
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,458
- Oh, modesty forbids.

99
00:08:17,084 --> 00:08:18,958
- Isn't it time
you people were in bed?

100
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,124
- Won't you join us, Uncle?

101
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:22,708
- Oh, no.
I just can't sleep.

102
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,791
Could you have a look
at this thumb in the morning?

103
00:08:26,084 --> 00:08:28,166
- I'll have a look at it right
now if you like, Mr. Bleibner,

104
00:08:28,459 --> 00:08:30,208
before I go to bed.

105
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,291
- It's, um...

106
00:08:36,584 --> 00:08:38,249
that cut I got the other day.

107
00:08:38,542 --> 00:08:39,749
- Okay.

108
00:08:40,042 --> 00:08:41,416
Good night, gentlemen.

109
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,333
- Miss Lemon, if you please,

110
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:54,791
would you come through
for a moment

111
00:08:55,084 --> 00:08:56,958
with your notepad and pencil?

112
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:02,583
I want that you send a telegram

113
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,333
to the Assistant Commissioner
Bergman

114
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:08,791
in the police department
of New York.

115
00:09:09,084 --> 00:09:13,874
Please supply all available
biographical material

116
00:09:14,167 --> 00:09:16,708
on Monsieur Rupert Bleibner,

117
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,666
nephew to the wealthy
Monsieur Felix Bleibner.

118
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:26,708
Best wishes, Hercule Poirot.

119
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,541
- I could say "biog."

120
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:29,916
- Comment?

121
00:09:30,209 --> 00:09:32,916
- Instead of "biographical,"
I could say "biog."

122
00:09:34,667 --> 00:09:36,291
- Is that a word, Miss Lemon?

123
00:09:36,584 --> 00:09:37,916
- It sounds efficient.

124
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:40,249
I heard someone say it
in a picture.

125
00:09:40,542 --> 00:09:44,041
"Give me the biog on
Dutch Schultz, Miss Longfellow."

126
00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:49,083
- "Biographical material"
will do very nicely, thank you,

127
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,208
Miss Lemon.

128
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,708
- Oh.
- What is it, Miss Lemon?

129
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,791
- There's no need for you

130
00:09:55,042 --> 00:09:57,833
to cable
Assistant Commissioner Bergman.

131
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,041
- Why is that, Miss Lemon?

132
00:09:59,334 --> 00:10:01,833
- You can cable
Captain Hastings instead.

133
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:04,874
- But Captain Hastings,
he is in California, Miss Lemon.

134
00:10:05,167 --> 00:10:07,041
- No, he's on his way back.

135
00:10:07,334 --> 00:10:09,749
He's staying in New York
until Friday.

136
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:01,041
- Who is it?
- Oh.

137
00:11:01,334 --> 00:11:03,416
It's Arthur Hastings, actually.

138
00:11:03,709 --> 00:11:05,041
- Who?

139
00:11:05,334 --> 00:11:07,624
- Arthur Hastings.

140
00:11:09,084 --> 00:11:10,416
I'm a friend of your uncle's.

141
00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:12,583
Well, more of an acquaintance,
really.

142
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:15,291
He said I should look you up.

143
00:11:15,584 --> 00:11:16,374
- Uncle Felix?

144
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:17,749
- Yes.

145
00:11:18,042 --> 00:11:20,791
You went out to Egypt
to visit him recently, I gather.

146
00:11:23,834 --> 00:11:24,874
- How do you know him?

147
00:11:25,167 --> 00:11:26,749
- How?

148
00:11:27,042 --> 00:11:30,708
Oh, well, just as one does,
you know.

149
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,541
Just socially.

150
00:11:32,834 --> 00:11:35,499
How did you find it out there?

151
00:11:35,792 --> 00:11:36,958
Egypt, I mean.

152
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,749
- Hot.

153
00:11:40,042 --> 00:11:44,333
Look, Mr. Hastings,

154
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:47,999
I guess I'm not feeling
all that sociable today.

155
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:50,833
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
I quite understand.

156
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,499
Good-bye.

157
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:54,541
- Nice to meet you.

158
00:11:54,834 --> 00:11:56,458
Look in again sometime.

159
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,541
- Thank you.

160
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:37,874
Yes, I'll have tea and porridge
and bacon and eggs, please.

161
00:12:38,167 --> 00:12:38,958
- Eggs over easy?

162
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,749
- Uh, no.
The other.

163
00:12:43,042 --> 00:12:45,416
- Two eggs, sunny side up.

164
00:12:45,709 --> 00:12:47,499
Canadian bacon?

165
00:12:47,792 --> 00:12:50,249
- Oh, uh, yes.
Thank you.

166
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,999
Good Lord.

167
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:08,041
- Felix Bleibner is dead?

168
00:13:08,334 --> 00:13:10,499
- He died three days ago.

169
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:14,124
I'm sorry.
I thought you already knew.

170
00:13:14,417 --> 00:13:16,833
It was horrible,
the most horrible death.

171
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:18,541
He was blind at the end.

172
00:13:18,834 --> 00:13:22,416
- Where's the doctor, Dr. Ames?

173
00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:24,124
- I'll take you to him.

174
00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:30,916
- Now, mind the legs.

175
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,291
Mind the legs!

176
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:38,666
- Wouldn't it be better
to wrap it?

177
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:39,916
- No.

178
00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:41,458
No, no, I don't think so.

179
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,583
It's better they be able
to see what they're moving.

180
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,958
- Oh, Dr. Ames,
can I trouble you for a moment?

181
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,833
This is Sir Guy Willard,
Sir John's son.

182
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:52,624
- Dr. Ames, how do you do?
- Hello.

183
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:54,166
- And this is Mr. Harper.

184
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,374
- How do you do?
- And Dr. Schneider.

185
00:13:56,667 --> 00:13:58,124
- Dr. Schneider.
- Hi.

186
00:13:58,417 --> 00:14:01,166
- Sir Guy has come to
take charge of the excavation.

187
00:14:01,459 --> 00:14:05,249
- Dr. Ames, I'm devastated
by the news of Mr. Bleibner.

188
00:14:05,542 --> 00:14:08,083
- It was septicemia.

189
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,541
- Yes, but how did it start?

190
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:13,791
- A scratch on his thumb.

191
00:14:14,084 --> 00:14:16,249
Nothing we could do
seemed to stop it.

192
00:14:16,542 --> 00:14:18,458
Dr. Ames amputated his left arm
last week, but--

193
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:22,124
- Amputated?

194
00:14:22,417 --> 00:14:24,083
Why was I not informed?

195
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:28,666
- Well, I--we weren't aware
you were involved.

196
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,833
- Well, I am involved.

197
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,541
The British Museum have agreed

198
00:14:32,834 --> 00:14:34,291
that I should take over
the excavation.

199
00:14:34,584 --> 00:14:38,499
- But surely Mr. Bleibner's
death changes the situation.

200
00:14:38,792 --> 00:14:41,749
- Well, indeed it does,
Dr. Schneider.

201
00:14:42,042 --> 00:14:44,749
I suggest we carry on as we are

202
00:14:45,042 --> 00:14:48,041
until the wishes of
Mr. Bleibner's estate are known.

203
00:14:48,334 --> 00:14:49,999
In the meantime,
perhaps you'd be good enough

204
00:14:50,292 --> 00:14:52,791
to show me to my quarters,
Dr. Fosswell.

205
00:14:53,084 --> 00:14:54,624
Gentlemen.

206
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:22,916
- Mr. Bleibner?

207
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,374
Mr. Bleibner?

208
00:15:56,834 --> 00:15:57,624
- Switchboard.

209
00:15:57,917 --> 00:15:59,333
- Give me the police.
- Yes, sir.

210
00:16:06,459 --> 00:16:09,083
- It came as a big surprise
to everyone?

211
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:10,291
- Absolutely.

212
00:16:10,584 --> 00:16:12,041
No one can understand it.

213
00:16:12,334 --> 00:16:13,374
They just see no Earthly reason

214
00:16:13,667 --> 00:16:15,083
why he should
have killed himself.

215
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,916
He was only 30.

216
00:16:18,209 --> 00:16:19,541
- His health, it was good?

217
00:16:19,834 --> 00:16:20,999
- Fit as a flea, it appears.

218
00:16:21,292 --> 00:16:23,124
Something of a sportsman too,
as a matter of fact.

219
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:24,708
Played football at school,

220
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,458
held some sort of local record
for the 100 yards, good golfer.

221
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,541
Played off scratch.

222
00:16:28,792 --> 00:16:29,749
- You playing the good golf

223
00:16:30,042 --> 00:16:32,083
is no reason not
to commit suicide, Hastings.

224
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:35,249
- You just don't
understand golf, Poirot.

225
00:16:37,459 --> 00:16:38,416
- What was his livelihood?

226
00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:41,124
- Well, up until
about six months ago,

227
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,791
he'd been in Hawaii
learning the hotel business.

228
00:16:44,084 --> 00:16:46,166
- Did he have
any problems emotionable?

229
00:16:46,459 --> 00:16:48,958
- Oh, girls, you mean.
Good Lord, no.

230
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,708
He was all set to marry this
absolute corker Melanie Wise.

231
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,416
Then he goes and shoots himself.

232
00:16:53,709 --> 00:16:55,791
Mind you,
the first time I saw him,

233
00:16:56,084 --> 00:16:59,083
he did seem very,
well, abstracted.

234
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:00,958
I mean, it was halfway through
the afternoon,

235
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,416
and he was still in his pajamas.

236
00:17:02,709 --> 00:17:05,166
Looked as if he hadn't
washed for a week too.

237
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:08,291
Oh, and he was wearing
white gloves.

238
00:17:10,334 --> 00:17:11,333
- White gloves?

239
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:14,708
- Yes, you know,
white cotton gloves.

240
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,749
- Did he have any problems
over money?

241
00:17:18,042 --> 00:17:19,666
- None at all
as far as I could tell.

242
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:21,291
Even less
when Old Bleibner died.

243
00:17:21,584 --> 00:17:23,416
The Bleibner millions
came to him.

244
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,541
I say, that's a point.

245
00:17:25,834 --> 00:17:27,208
I wonder who
will get the money now.

246
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,833
Oh, he left a note, you know.

247
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:32,791
- No, Hastings.
I did not know.

248
00:17:33,084 --> 00:17:34,916
- I made a copy of it.

249
00:17:38,209 --> 00:17:39,833
"There is no point in going on.

250
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,916
"I am a leper, an outcast.

251
00:17:42,209 --> 00:17:43,624
"It's better that I should
end my life now

252
00:17:43,917 --> 00:17:45,249
"than bring misery
to the people I love.

253
00:17:45,542 --> 00:17:48,374
Rupert Bleibner."

254
00:18:06,959 --> 00:18:09,166
- I didn't think you looked too
well at breakfast, Schneider.

255
00:18:09,459 --> 00:18:11,249
Does it hurt here?

256
00:18:11,542 --> 00:18:12,708
- A little.

257
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:21,583
- If I move your arm like this,
does that hurt?

258
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:25,333
- No...but there's
a sort of dull ache, though,

259
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:28,999
around my shoulders
and neck all the time.

260
00:18:29,292 --> 00:18:31,333
- Do you have
any trouble swallowing?

261
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:34,041
- Well, as a matter of fact,
I do.

262
00:18:34,334 --> 00:18:35,624
It started a few days ago.

263
00:18:35,917 --> 00:18:37,791
How'd you know that?

264
00:18:44,459 --> 00:18:45,249
- Hassan.

265
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,499
- Oh, Dr. Ames. Yes?

266
00:18:47,792 --> 00:18:50,666
- I'm going to drive to Cairo
to the British hospital.

267
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:53,374
I've got to persuade them
to give me some antitoxic serum.

268
00:18:53,667 --> 00:18:54,833
- When will you be back, sir?

269
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:57,624
- Well, by Friday, I hope,
if I drive day and night.

270
00:18:57,917 --> 00:18:58,708
- Be careful, sir.

271
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,541
- Oh, and, Hassan,

272
00:19:00,834 --> 00:19:02,624
try and get through to Cairo
by telephone.

273
00:19:02,917 --> 00:19:04,583
Let them know I'm on my way.

274
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,041
Thank you.

275
00:19:08,167 --> 00:19:10,041
- It goes on, Monsieur Poirot.

276
00:19:10,334 --> 00:19:14,624
First my husband.
Then Mr. Bleibner.

277
00:19:14,917 --> 00:19:18,874
Then his nephew.

278
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,666
- Try to continue, Lady Willard.

279
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:26,458
- Suppose there is some truth
in all this talk about a curse.

280
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,916
- Tell me what has happened.

281
00:19:31,209 --> 00:19:32,874
- Mr. Schneider

282
00:19:33,167 --> 00:19:37,374
of the Metropolitan Museum
of New York,

283
00:19:37,667 --> 00:19:42,583
he's very ill with tetanus.

284
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,708
My son just sent me
this telegram.

285
00:19:46,834 --> 00:19:47,833
I'm sorry.

286
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:51,124
You must think it very silly
and superstitious.

287
00:19:51,417 --> 00:19:53,666
- No, no, no.
Not at all, Lady Willard.

288
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,874
I also believe in the force
of superstition.

289
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:05,583
It is one of the greatest forces
that the world has ever known.

290
00:20:08,084 --> 00:20:09,333
And you wish that Poirot

291
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,041
should protect your son
against these forces.

292
00:20:12,334 --> 00:20:15,666
- Is it possible?

293
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,874
- But first I must allow
to do their work

294
00:20:19,167 --> 00:20:21,333
the little gray cells.

295
00:21:00,542 --> 00:21:01,958
- You're not pushing it,
are you?

296
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,374
- Of course I'm not pushing it.

297
00:21:06,709 --> 00:21:08,916
What's it writing?

298
00:21:09,209 --> 00:21:12,541
- I can't see.
I can't make it out.

299
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,166
Seems to have stopped.

300
00:21:18,959 --> 00:21:20,624
- Let's see what it's written.

301
00:21:23,834 --> 00:21:26,708
- Can't make it out.
- Yes.

302
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,166
There's a C.
That's an L.

303
00:21:29,459 --> 00:21:31,416
- Well, it's not very clear.

304
00:21:31,709 --> 00:21:34,916
- It's definitely trying
to say something, though.

305
00:21:35,209 --> 00:21:36,541
- Perhaps it's
not writing in English.

306
00:21:37,917 --> 00:21:39,916
Looks like Arabic or something.
I say.

307
00:21:40,209 --> 00:21:41,374
- What?

308
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:43,624
- Suppose it's King Men-her-Ra
trying to get through?

309
00:21:44,959 --> 00:21:46,666
- Miss Le--

310
00:21:46,959 --> 00:21:48,583
Hastings, what means this
with the planchette?

311
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,124
- Oh, we're just fooling around.

312
00:21:50,417 --> 00:21:51,374
It's interesting, though.

313
00:21:51,667 --> 00:21:53,624
We think this could be
from King Men-her-Ra.

314
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:55,499
- Hastings, please,
pull yourself together.

315
00:21:55,792 --> 00:21:57,624
We have business
to which we must attend.

316
00:21:57,917 --> 00:22:00,708
Tomorrow we fly to Cairo.

317
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,791
- Cairo?

318
00:22:02,084 --> 00:22:03,499
- In Egypt, Hastings.
- I know.

319
00:22:03,792 --> 00:22:06,041
- And then
to the Valley of the Kings.

320
00:22:40,417 --> 00:22:41,624
- His jaw is broken.

321
00:22:41,917 --> 00:22:43,208
- Broken?

322
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,916
- The muscles contract so
violently, it breaks the bones.

323
00:22:47,209 --> 00:22:48,333
- God.

324
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:51,291
Is there anything we can do?

325
00:22:51,584 --> 00:22:53,458
- He's not responding
to the serum.

326
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,666
- You must be Monsieur Poirot.

327
00:23:52,959 --> 00:23:54,791
- What is left of him, yes.

328
00:23:55,084 --> 00:23:57,083
- I'm Leonard Fosswell,
British Museum.

329
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:58,958
- Ah, Monsieur Fosswell.

330
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,708
- We got Lady Willard's cable.

331
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,833
I'm sorry.
This isn't a good time.

332
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:05,708
Now let me show you
to your tent.

333
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,124
Won't mind sharing, will you?

334
00:24:07,417 --> 00:24:09,374
- No, not at all.
I'm Arthur Hastings, by the way.

335
00:24:09,667 --> 00:24:12,958
- Yes, Lady Willard
said you'd be coming.

336
00:24:17,667 --> 00:24:20,124
Hassan will assign one of
the fellahin to look after you,

337
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:21,791
to get you hot water and so on.

338
00:24:22,084 --> 00:24:23,666
- Oh, this looks fine.

339
00:24:32,042 --> 00:24:34,374
Tell me, Dr. Fosswell...

340
00:24:37,167 --> 00:24:38,291
Why is this not a good time?

341
00:24:38,584 --> 00:24:40,999
- It's Dr. Schneider.

342
00:24:41,292 --> 00:24:42,624
- He has the malady, yes?

343
00:24:42,917 --> 00:24:43,708
- He's--

344
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,624
- Cannot stand
much more of this.

345
00:24:57,917 --> 00:24:59,041
- He's not responding?

346
00:24:59,334 --> 00:25:00,999
- No.

347
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:04,999
He, uh,
seems to be getting worse.

348
00:25:05,292 --> 00:25:06,999
Oh, God.
- Who is it?

349
00:25:07,292 --> 00:25:08,624
- That detective
my mother's so keen on.

350
00:25:08,917 --> 00:25:09,958
- Sir Guy.

351
00:25:11,959 --> 00:25:12,749
- Uh...

352
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,249
uh...he's dead.

353
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:30,166
- And you are quite sure,
are you not, Dr. Ames,

354
00:25:30,459 --> 00:25:34,333
that the death of Monsieur
Schneider was caused by tetanus?

355
00:25:34,625 --> 00:25:35,499
- Sure.

356
00:25:35,792 --> 00:25:37,124
- It could not have been,
for instance,

357
00:25:37,417 --> 00:25:38,999
a case of
the strychnine poisoning?

358
00:25:39,292 --> 00:25:40,249
- Strychnine?

359
00:25:40,542 --> 00:25:41,999
- No, Monsieur Poirot.

360
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:44,208
There's been no suggestion
of anything like that.

361
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,624
This was a clear case
of tetanus.

362
00:25:46,917 --> 00:25:49,458
- Did you inject antiserum?

363
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,124
- Of course we did.

364
00:25:51,417 --> 00:25:55,458
Every conceivable thing
that could be done was done.

365
00:25:58,459 --> 00:26:00,333
- But Monsieur Bleibner now,

366
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:02,541
he died of something
completely different?

367
00:26:02,834 --> 00:26:04,833
- Mr. Bleibner had a scratch
on his thumb.

368
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:07,791
It became poisoned,
and septicemia set in.

369
00:26:08,084 --> 00:26:10,583
It sounds pretty much the same
to a layman, I imagine,

370
00:26:10,875 --> 00:26:13,041
but the two things
are entirely different.

371
00:26:26,834 --> 00:26:30,666
- You must ask us any questions
you need to, Monsieur Poirot.

372
00:26:30,959 --> 00:26:34,374
We're all dumbfounded
by this series of disasters.

373
00:26:34,667 --> 00:26:36,208
But it isn't any--

374
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,708
Can’t be anything
but coincidence.

375
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,833
- I see.

376
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:45,041
And you are determined, Sir Guy,

377
00:26:45,334 --> 00:26:47,083
to continue
with this excavation?

378
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:49,499
- Monsieur Poirot,
no matter what happens,

379
00:26:49,792 --> 00:26:52,041
my father's work is going on.

380
00:26:52,334 --> 00:26:53,958
- I see.

381
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:55,208
Alors, évidemment,

382
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,583
we must find out exactly
what is the position here.

383
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:20,041
- Alabaster perfume box.

384
00:27:20,334 --> 00:27:23,416
Height, 7 1/2 inches.
Depth, 5 1/4 inches.

385
00:27:25,209 --> 00:27:26,416
Sniff.

386
00:27:31,209 --> 00:27:32,749
Ah, jasmine.

387
00:27:33,042 --> 00:27:34,874
- 3,000-year-old jasmine.

388
00:27:37,167 --> 00:27:39,291
- How long have you been
interested in Egyptology,

389
00:27:39,584 --> 00:27:40,499
Monsieur Harper?

390
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:41,958
- Oh, ever since
I started working

391
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,458
as Mr. Bleibner's secretary.

392
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,208
I was in his college almost.

393
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,958
- You were at Yale
with Rupert Bleibner.

394
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,041
- Yes, I was there

395
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:50,124
on a Hendrickson
exchange scholarship.

396
00:27:50,417 --> 00:27:51,874
Ames was with us too.

397
00:27:52,167 --> 00:27:55,749
All Yalies, you see.
Class of '27.

398
00:27:56,042 --> 00:27:57,874
- That is most interesting.

399
00:27:58,167 --> 00:28:00,208
There are four people involved
in this expedition

400
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,999
who have known each other
for some considerable time.

401
00:28:03,292 --> 00:28:04,499
With Dr. Ames, Rupert Bleibner,

402
00:28:04,792 --> 00:28:06,958
yourself all together
at the college,

403
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,041
and of course the uncle
of Rupert Bleibner.

404
00:28:09,334 --> 00:28:10,416
- That's right.

405
00:28:10,709 --> 00:28:11,583
- Two of them are now dead.

406
00:28:11,875 --> 00:28:13,458
- Are you trying
to give me the creeps?

407
00:28:17,125 --> 00:28:19,249
- Tell me about Monsieur Rupert.

408
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:26,041
- I really don't understand
him doing what he did.

409
00:28:26,334 --> 00:28:30,208
- When he first arrived here,
he was in good health?

410
00:28:32,084 --> 00:28:34,083
Yes, I don't think he'd had
a day's real illness

411
00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:35,708
his entire life.

412
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,499
Terrible hypochondriac, though.

413
00:28:37,792 --> 00:28:39,249
Always got a lot
of little aches and pains

414
00:28:39,542 --> 00:28:40,583
he was always worrying about.

415
00:28:40,875 --> 00:28:42,708
- But when last you saw him,
he was not suffering?

416
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,583
- No, can't remember anything
in particular.

417
00:28:45,875 --> 00:28:48,624
Oh, well, yes, he had
a little eczema on his hand

418
00:28:48,917 --> 00:28:50,833
he was making
a great to-do about.

419
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:23,583
- Master, I must speak with you.

420
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:26,333
- Oh. Right.
Good evening.

421
00:29:26,625 --> 00:29:30,041
- I served my lord Sir John,
and now I serve his son.

422
00:29:30,334 --> 00:29:32,458
- Yes, quite.

423
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,708
- You are a wise one, they say.

424
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,624
- Well, you know.

425
00:29:36,917 --> 00:29:39,333
- And learned in dealing
with evil spirits.

426
00:29:39,625 --> 00:29:40,749
I beg of you,

427
00:29:41,042 --> 00:29:43,041
let the young master
depart from here.

428
00:29:43,334 --> 00:29:45,541
There is evil
in the air around us.

429
00:29:45,834 --> 00:29:49,291
- Well, uh,
it's not really up to me.

430
00:29:49,584 --> 00:29:50,958
You see--

431
00:30:03,292 --> 00:30:06,999
- We have had four deaths,
all totally dissimilar.

432
00:30:09,084 --> 00:30:10,958
One heart failure,
one poisoning,

433
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:14,083
one tetanus,
and one suicide.

434
00:30:14,375 --> 00:30:16,041
- Exactly.

435
00:30:16,334 --> 00:30:22,166
- Is there nothing which might
link together these four?

436
00:30:22,459 --> 00:30:25,333
- Something they have in common?
No.

437
00:30:25,625 --> 00:30:28,166
- I'm sorry, Mr. Poirot.
I don't quite understand this.

438
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:31,166
- Then, Monsieur Harper, let me
make myself perfectly clear.

439
00:30:31,459 --> 00:30:35,916
Was there any act committed
by these men, these victims,

440
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:39,666
which might seem
to denote some disrespect

441
00:30:39,959 --> 00:30:41,583
to the spirit
of Men-her-Ra?

442
00:30:41,875 --> 00:30:43,208
- Good grief, man.

443
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,958
That is all rot,
as well you know.

444
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:48,041
- You're talking
through your hat.

445
00:30:48,334 --> 00:30:50,041
- You do not believe that such
a thing is possible?

446
00:30:50,334 --> 00:30:51,583
- No, I do not.

447
00:30:51,875 --> 00:30:54,791
We're men of science, and I
believe what science teaches.

448
00:30:55,084 --> 00:30:57,249
- Indeed.

449
00:30:57,542 --> 00:31:00,624
Was there no science then
in ancient Egypt?

450
00:31:00,917 --> 00:31:04,249
Oh, no, no, no, no, please,
do not answer, but tell me this,

451
00:31:04,542 --> 00:31:07,333
the native workmen,
what do they think?

452
00:31:07,625 --> 00:31:09,499
- Well, if the white folk
lose their heads,

453
00:31:09,792 --> 00:31:11,541
then the natives
aren't gonna be far behind.

454
00:31:11,834 --> 00:31:13,916
Yes.

455
00:31:14,209 --> 00:31:15,874
Yes, I'll admit
they're getting scared,

456
00:31:16,167 --> 00:31:17,874
but they've
got no cause to be.

457
00:31:21,125 --> 00:31:22,708
- Excuse me, I'm--

458
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,791
- Ames, are you all right?

459
00:31:25,292 --> 00:31:26,833
- Good heavens.
- Hassan.

460
00:31:27,125 --> 00:31:28,166
Help me get him to his tent.

461
00:31:28,459 --> 00:31:29,541
- Would a brandy help?

462
00:31:29,834 --> 00:31:31,999
- No, I don't think so.
We'll get him to bed.

463
00:31:40,459 --> 00:31:41,249
- Good Lord.

464
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,083
Poor fellow.

465
00:32:10,917 --> 00:32:12,416
- Tell me when you want
another photograph.

466
00:32:12,709 --> 00:32:15,166
- Not yet.

467
00:32:15,459 --> 00:32:18,041
- Did you know, Monsieur Poirot,
that a wreath of flowers

468
00:32:18,334 --> 00:32:20,166
from the funeral ceremony
was still lying

469
00:32:20,459 --> 00:32:22,458
on the antechamber floor
when my father opened the tomb?

470
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:23,624
- Oh.

471
00:32:23,917 --> 00:32:25,041
It is amazing, is it not,
Hastings?

472
00:32:25,334 --> 00:32:29,166
- Absolutely.
- How is Dr. Ames today?

473
00:32:29,459 --> 00:32:30,624
- He's still not well.

474
00:32:30,917 --> 00:32:32,124
He got up today.

475
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:35,124
To tell the truth,
I'm rather worried about him.

476
00:32:35,417 --> 00:32:37,749
- I think we're ready.

477
00:32:38,042 --> 00:32:39,833
- Lift away then.

478
00:32:44,917 --> 00:32:46,999
- Tie off.

479
00:32:50,417 --> 00:32:53,666
Good God.

480
00:32:53,959 --> 00:32:55,749
- He has lain here
in perfect silence

481
00:32:56,042 --> 00:33:00,374
since 1,000 years
before Troy was besieged.

482
00:33:02,292 --> 00:33:04,541
Rome rose and fell.

483
00:33:04,834 --> 00:33:08,666
Wars and catastrophes
changed the face of the Earth.

484
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:14,166
But still, this king, he waited.

485
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:19,124
Forgotten by all those people
we read about.

486
00:33:25,334 --> 00:33:27,749
Dr. Fosswell?
- Come.

487
00:33:34,375 --> 00:33:36,874
- What a moment,
Dr. Fosswell, eh?

488
00:33:37,167 --> 00:33:37,999
- What?

489
00:33:38,292 --> 00:33:39,333
- Well, to have had
the privilege

490
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:40,583
of merely standing by

491
00:33:40,875 --> 00:33:42,416
as the lid of the sarcophagus,
it was opened.

492
00:33:42,709 --> 00:33:45,958
- Oh, yes.
Yes, I'm just writing it out.

493
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:49,749
- Ah, you write the reports for
the expedition, n'est-ce pas?

494
00:33:50,042 --> 00:33:51,374
- For the expedition?
No, no, no, no, no.

495
00:33:51,667 --> 00:33:52,874
By no means.

496
00:33:53,167 --> 00:33:56,291
I daily report for the eyes
of Sir Andrew Caens only.

497
00:33:56,584 --> 00:33:58,499
- Ah.

498
00:33:58,792 --> 00:34:00,874
May I?
- Please.

499
00:34:01,167 --> 00:34:02,333
- Thank you.

500
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:08,416
Now, Sir Andrew Caens,

501
00:34:08,709 --> 00:34:10,666
he is the keeper of antiquities
at the British museum,

502
00:34:10,959 --> 00:34:11,749
n'est-ce pas?

503
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,249
- Quite.

504
00:34:13,542 --> 00:34:16,374
The others can do their own
reports, though frankly...

505
00:34:16,667 --> 00:34:19,083
Well, no matter.

506
00:34:19,375 --> 00:34:24,083
- And Monsieur Schneider,
when he was alive,

507
00:34:24,375 --> 00:34:27,416
he would have made the reports
for the Metropolitan Museum.

508
00:34:27,709 --> 00:34:28,791
- I suppose so, yes.

509
00:34:29,084 --> 00:34:31,749
I mean, I don't want
to speak ill of the dead,

510
00:34:32,042 --> 00:34:33,583
but it does just show
the quality

511
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:35,083
of their scholarship,
doesn't it?

512
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:36,749
When the Metropolitan
have to send out

513
00:34:37,042 --> 00:34:38,791
somebody like Schneider.

514
00:34:39,084 --> 00:34:41,249
Poor fellow.

515
00:34:41,542 --> 00:34:43,166
The BM would never
have sent anyone

516
00:34:43,459 --> 00:34:45,374
but their most senior
archaeologist.

517
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:49,249
- And the future keeper
of the antiquities perhaps.

518
00:34:49,542 --> 00:34:50,333
- What?

519
00:34:50,584 --> 00:34:54,124
Oh, well,
I don't know about that.

520
00:34:54,417 --> 00:34:57,833
Of course, Sir Andrew is due
for retirement in two years.

521
00:34:58,125 --> 00:35:01,999
And if I make a fair fist
at this, well...

522
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:27,458
- Oh, you're in bed.

523
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,374
- This is a work most
interesting, Hastings.

524
00:35:30,667 --> 00:35:32,333
Listen to this.

525
00:35:32,625 --> 00:35:35,041
"May your knives
not get hold of me.

526
00:35:35,334 --> 00:35:37,541
"May my hands
not touch the poison.

527
00:35:37,834 --> 00:35:39,791
"May I not fall
into your slaughterhouse,

528
00:35:40,084 --> 00:35:44,333
"for I know your names,
and my heart is with Osiris."

529
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:46,249
- Look here, Poirot,
are you feeling all right?

530
00:35:46,542 --> 00:35:47,708
- Perfectly, Hastings.

531
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,791
- I mean, you've had a lot
of sun these last few days.

532
00:35:50,084 --> 00:35:51,291
You're not used to it like I am.

533
00:35:51,584 --> 00:35:55,041
- I am perfectly well.
Thank you, Hastings.

534
00:36:02,542 --> 00:36:04,666
Hastings, what is the matter
with Miss Lemon?

535
00:36:04,959 --> 00:36:07,458
- Miss Lemon?
Nothing, as far as I know.

536
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:08,874
- Come, Hastings.

537
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,374
Do not do the shilly-shally
with me.

538
00:36:10,667 --> 00:36:12,666
Yourself play with her
on the planchette.

539
00:36:12,959 --> 00:36:15,791
- Well, I think it's her cat.

540
00:36:16,084 --> 00:36:17,916
You know, the one she used
to call Catherine the Great

541
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:19,791
because it liked sleeping
in the fireplace.

542
00:36:20,084 --> 00:36:22,208
- That cat, it died, did it not?

543
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,291
- Well, exactly.

544
00:36:23,542 --> 00:36:25,499
She's fearfully cut up about it.

545
00:36:25,792 --> 00:36:27,333
I think she's trying
to get in touch with it.

546
00:36:27,625 --> 00:36:28,958
- Oh.
- I mean, I think it's--

547
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:30,291
- Hastings, look!

548
00:36:32,584 --> 00:36:34,083
- Good God.

549
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:45,749
- "Deliver me from that god
whose face is that of a hound

550
00:36:46,042 --> 00:36:50,041
"but whose skin
is that of a man,

551
00:36:50,334 --> 00:36:52,458
"who liveth upon the damned,

552
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:57,791
"digesting human hearts,
voiding filth.

553
00:36:58,084 --> 00:37:01,583
One seeth him not."

554
00:37:27,375 --> 00:37:29,666
- Hastings, what are you doing?

555
00:37:29,959 --> 00:37:31,666
- Well, I'm having my siesta.

556
00:37:31,959 --> 00:37:33,124
- No, no, no, no, Hastings.

557
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,666
Get up.
We have work to do.

558
00:37:34,959 --> 00:37:36,249
Come.

559
00:38:00,459 --> 00:38:01,999
Whose tent is this, Hastings?

560
00:38:02,292 --> 00:38:03,958
- Uh, Dr. Ames'.

561
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:06,624
- You must remain here on guard,
my friend,

562
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:07,708
while I make the search.

563
00:38:07,959 --> 00:38:10,041
- Search?
Oh, no.

564
00:38:40,375 --> 00:38:48,499
Poirot.

565
00:38:55,292 --> 00:38:56,166
Well, well, well.

566
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:58,083
- I beg your pardon?

567
00:38:58,375 --> 00:39:00,166
- Feeling a bit better, are you,
Dr. Ames?

568
00:39:00,459 --> 00:39:01,249
- Are you waiting for me?

569
00:39:01,542 --> 00:39:02,708
- No, no.
No. No.

570
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,583
I was waiting for Poirot,
actually.

571
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:06,666
You haven't seen him at all,
have you?

572
00:39:16,167 --> 00:39:17,624
Poirot?

573
00:39:17,917 --> 00:39:20,333
- Can I come past?
- What?

574
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:21,708
- I want to go to my tent.

575
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,583
- Oh, this is your tent, is it?

576
00:39:23,875 --> 00:39:25,458
Uh, I didn't realize that.

577
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:27,333
They're very good, these tents,
aren't they?

578
00:39:27,625 --> 00:39:29,583
- Please, Captain Hastings.

579
00:39:36,709 --> 00:39:38,416
- Poirot,
you really are the limit.

580
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,999
- My God, Hastings.
The sand, it gets everywhere.

581
00:39:41,292 --> 00:39:43,374
- Ames must think
I'm a complete idiot.

582
00:39:45,709 --> 00:39:47,041
Plenty of sand in Belgium,
isn't there?

583
00:39:47,334 --> 00:39:49,041
- Not in Brussels, Hastings.

584
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,916
Hello, Miss Lemon,
can you hear me?

585
00:39:59,209 --> 00:40:02,916
- Yes, I found
Mr. Bleibner's solicitor.

586
00:40:03,209 --> 00:40:04,374
I spoke to him.

587
00:40:04,667 --> 00:40:07,041
- One moment, if you please,
Miss Lemon.

588
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,916
Hello?

589
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:22,208
Now you said he read
to you the will?

590
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,166
Bon, what did it say?

591
00:40:26,334 --> 00:40:28,749
Yes. Yes.

592
00:40:29,042 --> 00:40:30,499
Cigarette case, Miss Lemon?

593
00:40:30,792 --> 00:40:34,874
- I think it was just a joke,
Mr. Poirot.

594
00:40:35,167 --> 00:40:36,458
- I see.

595
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:37,958
Go on if you please.

596
00:40:40,167 --> 00:40:43,374
Thank you, Miss Lemon.
Au revoir.

597
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:52,958
What? What?
You want some what?

598
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,374
All right,
but only if you're good.

599
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:03,583
- I have half a mind
to volunteer to stay,

600
00:41:03,875 --> 00:41:04,958
you know, Poirot.

601
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,416
- What for, Hastings?

602
00:41:06,709 --> 00:41:08,208
- Take up this archaeology.

603
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,249
Can't you feel the fascination?

604
00:41:10,542 --> 00:41:11,708
Desert life,

605
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,791
probing into the heart
of vanished civilization.

606
00:41:15,084 --> 00:41:15,999
- Thank you, Hassan.

607
00:41:16,292 --> 00:41:18,458
On the table next to my bed,
if you please.

608
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:23,166
Thank you.

609
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:30,791
- Wish we were getting somewhere
with this case, though.

610
00:41:31,084 --> 00:41:33,166
Sometimes I think it's not
a case at all,

611
00:41:33,459 --> 00:41:35,208
just three natural deaths
and one suicide.

612
00:41:36,542 --> 00:41:37,916
What do you think, Poirot?

613
00:41:38,209 --> 00:41:40,416
You don't seem to have
any theories at all.

614
00:41:40,709 --> 00:41:41,499
Do you?

615
00:41:44,584 --> 00:41:47,916
- Oh, my God.
Poirot!

616
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:54,333
Dr. Ames!

617
00:41:54,625 --> 00:41:56,166
It's Poirot.
Quick.

618
00:42:00,292 --> 00:42:02,624
It's Poirot.
He's ill, dead, I don't know.

619
00:42:02,917 --> 00:42:03,791
It's the chamomile tea.

620
00:42:04,084 --> 00:42:05,249
Don't let Hassan leave the camp.

621
00:42:05,542 --> 00:42:06,999
- There's still a pulse.

622
00:42:07,292 --> 00:42:08,666
- What's going on?

623
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:10,541
- It's Poirot.
He's collapsed.

624
00:42:10,834 --> 00:42:12,374
- Do you smell anything?

625
00:42:12,667 --> 00:42:13,749
- Almonds.

626
00:42:14,042 --> 00:42:15,166
- Cyanide.

627
00:42:15,459 --> 00:42:17,916
- Which, fortunately,
I did not drink.

628
00:42:18,209 --> 00:42:19,791
Thank you, Hastings.

629
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:28,083
While my good friend Captain
Hastings was calling for help,

630
00:42:28,375 --> 00:42:30,958
I took the opportunity
of pouring the contents

631
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:35,874
from that glass...

632
00:42:36,167 --> 00:42:38,208
into this little bottle.

633
00:42:39,792 --> 00:42:43,083
And this little bottle will go
to the analytical chemist.

634
00:42:57,875 --> 00:43:01,458
The first death need not come
into our calculations

635
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:04,916
except for one thing.

636
00:43:05,209 --> 00:43:07,499
The quite natural death
of your father, Sir Guy,

637
00:43:07,792 --> 00:43:11,958
was what gave
to our murderer his idea.

638
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:15,374
The more deaths that occurred,

639
00:43:15,667 --> 00:43:20,124
the more everyone would talk
about the curse of Men-her-Ra,

640
00:43:20,417 --> 00:43:23,666
but the less everyone
would ask the proper questions.

641
00:43:23,959 --> 00:43:24,833
- I'm afraid we thought you

642
00:43:25,125 --> 00:43:27,124
were just as superstitious
as the rest.

643
00:43:27,417 --> 00:43:28,708
- But that was my intention.

644
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,791
You see, I wanted
to lull the murderer

645
00:43:33,084 --> 00:43:37,458
into a false sense
of security until I was ready.

646
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:40,749
And in that, I was successful.

647
00:43:43,459 --> 00:43:46,916
The murderer thought
that one more little nudge

648
00:43:47,209 --> 00:43:50,916
would send Hastings and myself
scurrying off back to England.

649
00:43:51,209 --> 00:43:52,333
- Good God.

650
00:43:52,625 --> 00:43:56,583
- He thought that
a cheap trick might do it.

651
00:43:56,875 --> 00:43:58,583
Mais non.

652
00:43:58,875 --> 00:44:02,458
I had to make him act,

653
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:05,916
and I have now done something
that has so alarmed him

654
00:44:06,209 --> 00:44:09,458
that he feels he must now add me
to his roll of victims.

655
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:15,541
What is it that I have done that
has so alarmed our murderer,

656
00:44:15,834 --> 00:44:19,708
flushed him out,
and made him try to poison me?

657
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:24,624
Let us go back
to the first murder,

658
00:44:24,917 --> 00:44:28,416
that of Monsieur Felix Bleibner.

659
00:44:31,542 --> 00:44:33,499
- Isn't it time
you people were in bed?

660
00:44:33,792 --> 00:44:34,874
- Won't you join us, Uncle?

661
00:44:35,167 --> 00:44:36,791
- I asked myself
who would want

662
00:44:37,084 --> 00:44:38,499
to murder
Monsieur Felix Bleibner.

663
00:44:38,792 --> 00:44:41,333
Alors, he was a man
who was very rich,

664
00:44:41,625 --> 00:44:45,374
therefore, my first assumption
would be his heir and nephew,

665
00:44:45,667 --> 00:44:48,083
Monsieur Rupert Bleibner.

666
00:44:48,375 --> 00:44:51,208
Mais non.

667
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,124
Monsieur Rupert Bleibner
committed a suicide

668
00:44:53,417 --> 00:44:55,416
even before he heard
of the death of his uncle,

669
00:44:55,709 --> 00:44:57,541
and so my next question was,

670
00:44:57,834 --> 00:44:59,916
why should
Monsieur Rupert Bleibner wish

671
00:45:00,209 --> 00:45:01,374
to take his own life?

672
00:45:01,667 --> 00:45:03,541
Alors, he was a man who
was young, happy, successful.

673
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:04,916
He had no thought of death.

674
00:45:05,209 --> 00:45:07,291
He had not even
made a proper will.

675
00:45:07,584 --> 00:45:09,624
- I could never
understand him doing it.

676
00:45:09,917 --> 00:45:14,166
- And yet, Dr. Fosswell, he told
to us the reasons quite plainly

677
00:45:14,459 --> 00:45:16,249
and precisely in a note
that he left,

678
00:45:16,542 --> 00:45:18,333
so plainly indeed
that we thought

679
00:45:18,625 --> 00:45:20,499
we was speaking metaphorically.

680
00:45:20,792 --> 00:45:22,666
He wrote, did he not...

681
00:45:22,959 --> 00:45:25,458
- "I am a leper and an outcast.

682
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:27,291
"It's better
that I should end my life now

683
00:45:27,584 --> 00:45:29,624
than bring misery
to the people I love."

684
00:45:29,917 --> 00:45:31,416
- On the threshold of marriage

685
00:45:31,709 --> 00:45:34,166
and a life that was happy
and successful,

686
00:45:34,459 --> 00:45:37,791
Monsieur Rupert Bleibner
believed that he was doomed.

687
00:45:38,084 --> 00:45:41,458
He believed he had leprosy.

688
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:44,208
During his last days, he even
took to wearing the white gloves

689
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:47,208
to hide the first unsightly
signs of the disease.

690
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,166
- But why should he think
he had leprosy?

691
00:45:49,459 --> 00:45:51,666
- Because, Hastings,
it was told to him that he had,

692
00:45:51,959 --> 00:45:54,874
and he had every good reason
to believe it.

693
00:45:55,167 --> 00:45:57,958
For some time,
he had been living in Hawaii

694
00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:00,041
where the disease,
it is endemic.

695
00:46:00,334 --> 00:46:02,749
And while in Hawaii,

696
00:46:03,042 --> 00:46:07,666
he would have come across
chaulmoogra oil.

697
00:46:09,375 --> 00:46:11,083
Now, he may not have heard
of the more modern drugs

698
00:46:11,375 --> 00:46:12,541
that have now superseded it,

699
00:46:12,834 --> 00:46:16,791
but he would definitely have
come across chaulmoogra oil.

700
00:46:18,334 --> 00:46:20,208
- What is this chaulmoogra oil?

701
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:23,041
- Chaulmoogra oil, Hastings,

702
00:46:23,334 --> 00:46:26,499
was once the only treatment
for leprosy.

703
00:46:26,792 --> 00:46:31,249
But in this case, it was used
merely as the window dressing

704
00:46:31,542 --> 00:46:34,333
to convince Rupert Bleibner
of his condition.

705
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,624
- But how do you know that?

706
00:46:36,917 --> 00:46:38,791
- I know that, Hastings,

707
00:46:39,084 --> 00:46:43,499
because I have stolen
some chaulmoogra oil

708
00:46:43,792 --> 00:46:45,708
from the murderer.

709
00:46:50,209 --> 00:46:52,749
Hercule Poirot
has discovered his secret.

710
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:56,041
- What secret?

711
00:46:56,292 --> 00:46:58,374
What is all this?

712
00:47:00,542 --> 00:47:04,333
Monsieur Rupert Bleibner
went to Dr. Ames

713
00:47:04,625 --> 00:47:07,624
with a mild case of eczema,

714
00:47:07,917 --> 00:47:12,416
and Dr. Ames
diagnosed leprosy.

715
00:47:12,709 --> 00:47:14,666
And pauvre
Monsieur Rupert Bleibner

716
00:47:14,959 --> 00:47:17,708
saw no way out but death.

717
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,666
- This is nonsense.

718
00:47:19,959 --> 00:47:22,749
I mean, why would
I want Rupert to kill himself?

719
00:47:23,042 --> 00:47:24,291
He was my friend.

720
00:47:24,584 --> 00:47:26,833
We were at college together.

721
00:47:27,125 --> 00:47:28,583
- In the possession
of the lawyers

722
00:47:28,875 --> 00:47:31,416
of Monsieur Rupert Bleibner
is a sheet of paper.

723
00:47:31,709 --> 00:47:34,791
It is old. It is creased.

724
00:47:35,084 --> 00:47:36,833
Probably written on
while at college

725
00:47:37,125 --> 00:47:38,874
during some fit
of a drunken merriment,

726
00:47:39,167 --> 00:47:42,916
but the handwriting is that
of Monsieur Rupert Bleibner.

727
00:47:43,209 --> 00:47:45,916
It reads as follows.

728
00:47:46,209 --> 00:47:49,666
"This is the last will and
testament of Rupert Bleibner.

729
00:47:49,959 --> 00:47:52,458
"I leave my cigarette case
which he admires so much

730
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:54,499
"and all
of which I die possessed

731
00:47:54,792 --> 00:47:58,333
"to my good friend
Robert Ames

732
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:02,541
who once saved my life
from drowning."

733
00:48:04,875 --> 00:48:06,916
You see, Dr. Ames,

734
00:48:07,209 --> 00:48:10,083
you knew that on the death
of Monsieur Felix Bleibner,

735
00:48:10,375 --> 00:48:13,499
his fortune in entirety
would go to his heir and nephew,

736
00:48:13,792 --> 00:48:15,083
Monsieur Rupert Bleibner,

737
00:48:15,375 --> 00:48:18,166
but were Monsieur
Rupert Bleibner to die...

738
00:48:21,667 --> 00:48:22,458
- All right.

739
00:48:22,709 --> 00:48:24,666
Now, keep back, all of you.

740
00:48:34,042 --> 00:48:35,333
Get off.

741
00:48:35,625 --> 00:48:37,916
Let me go!

742
00:48:46,042 --> 00:48:49,833
- You have already three deaths
on your head, Dr. Ames.

743
00:48:50,125 --> 00:48:52,374
Is that not enough?

744
00:48:57,792 --> 00:49:00,624
- But Dr. Ames
did not kill my husband.

745
00:49:00,917 --> 00:49:02,458
- No, Lady Willard.

746
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:04,499
The death of your husband
Sir John

747
00:49:04,792 --> 00:49:07,624
was from the causes
quite natural.

748
00:49:07,917 --> 00:49:10,499
You see, the only deaths
that interested Dr. Ames

749
00:49:10,792 --> 00:49:12,749
were those
of Monsieur Felix Bleibner,

750
00:49:13,042 --> 00:49:16,291
who perished from septicemia
introduced into his cut hand

751
00:49:16,584 --> 00:49:18,124
by Dr. Ames himself,

752
00:49:18,417 --> 00:49:20,208
and Monsieur Rupert Bleibner,

753
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,458
who Dr. Ames drove to suicide
by convincing him

754
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:25,249
that he suffers
from the leprosy.

755
00:49:25,542 --> 00:49:28,874
- And Dr. Schneider.
- Indeed.

756
00:49:29,167 --> 00:49:31,499
Dr. Ames injected
poor Henry Schneider

757
00:49:31,792 --> 00:49:33,583
with tetanus bacillus
merely to lend strength

758
00:49:33,875 --> 00:49:35,624
to the curse of Men-her-Ra.

759
00:49:35,917 --> 00:49:39,249
- I think you've been
wonderfully clever.

760
00:49:41,042 --> 00:49:42,333
- Good-bye, sir.
- Sir Guy.

761
00:49:42,625 --> 00:49:44,333
- I return to the Valley
of the Kings tomorrow.

762
00:49:44,625 --> 00:49:45,874
- This time with my blessing.

763
00:49:46,167 --> 00:49:47,999
- Bonjour.
- Yes, well then.

764
00:49:48,292 --> 00:49:49,958
- Au revoir.

765
00:49:59,584 --> 00:50:01,708
Miss Lemon, would you
come through for a moment?

766
00:50:12,334 --> 00:50:15,124
Miss Lemon, in addition
to serving this case

767
00:50:15,417 --> 00:50:18,333
that has been most difficult,
Hastings and I,

768
00:50:18,625 --> 00:50:20,666
we have brought you back
a little gift

769
00:50:20,959 --> 00:50:23,499
from the very tomb
of King Men-her-Ra.

770
00:50:23,792 --> 00:50:25,458
- From the tomb?

771
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:29,916
- Oui.

772
00:50:30,209 --> 00:50:33,749
Voilà.

773
00:50:34,042 --> 00:50:36,249
It is the very likeness
of the favorite cat

774
00:50:36,542 --> 00:50:41,208
of King Men-her-Ra
buried with him in his tomb

775
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:46,874
to keep him company
on his long journey.

776
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:51,124
- Oh, he's beautiful.

777
00:50:51,417 --> 00:50:56,166
- Go to bed this evening
with him in your hand

778
00:50:56,459 --> 00:51:01,541
and Catherine the Great
will visit you during the night.

779
00:51:01,834 --> 00:51:06,083
- Oh, Mr. Poirot, thank you.

780
00:51:15,125 --> 00:51:18,374
- I don't know how you can
tell her such guff, Poirot.

781
00:51:18,667 --> 00:51:21,541
- No, no, no, no, no, Hastings.
It is not a guff.

782
00:51:21,834 --> 00:51:23,958
It is, as I said
at the beginning of this case

783
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:29,958
to Lady Willard,
the power of superstition.

784
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:33,833
It is a power
that that is very great indeed.
