1
00:01:48,584 --> 00:01:51,708
- Ladies and gentlemen...

2
00:01:54,542 --> 00:01:58,874
When the Russian actress
and dancer Natalya Dolzhenko

3
00:01:59,167 --> 00:02:01,791
made Salome in 1908,

4
00:02:02,084 --> 00:02:05,833
she wore a necklace
made of magnificent pearls

5
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:11,416
given to her by the czar.

6
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:14,666
Last week,
at an auction in Paris,

7
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:21,791
I paid 300,000 francs
for that same pearl necklace.

8
00:02:22,084 --> 00:02:25,083
My wife is going to show it
to you now.

9
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:45,333
- Ladies and gentlemen,
dear friends,

10
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:49,999
our new play premieres here
at your beautiful theater

11
00:02:50,292 --> 00:02:53,791
next week, prior to
a six-month tour of America.

12
00:02:54,084 --> 00:02:57,166
- Yes, Margaret is taking
the leading part,

13
00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:00,416
and she will be wearing
the czar's pearls

14
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:02,958
at each and every performance.

15
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,916
- Mr. Opalsen,
don't the pearls get stolen

16
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:08,416
in the course of the play?

17
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:11,874
- Yes, they do.

18
00:03:12,167 --> 00:03:13,499
But that's in the play.

19
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:17,458
They will be under guard
24 hours a day.

20
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:23,166
I think I can promise you
that they're not going anywhere.

21
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,333
- Ah.
Ah.

22
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,791
- And again, please.

23
00:03:34,084 --> 00:03:35,874
- Ah.

24
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:39,208
- Thank you.

25
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,499
- Well, Doctor?
Tell me.

26
00:03:43,792 --> 00:03:45,958
What is your diagnosis?

27
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,999
- Well, essentially...
- Yes?

28
00:03:49,292 --> 00:03:50,749
- You're run down.

29
00:03:51,042 --> 00:03:54,249
Even those famous gray cells
of yours

30
00:03:54,542 --> 00:03:56,749
need an occasional rest.

31
00:03:57,042 --> 00:03:59,249
- It is true, Mr. Poirot.

32
00:03:59,542 --> 00:04:02,458
You've been taking on
much too much recently.

33
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,458
- Two weeks' complete rest.

34
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,458
That's the answer.

35
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,291
If I were you, I'd think
of getting out of London.

36
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:19,749
- This hotel, Hastings,

37
00:04:20,042 --> 00:04:21,916
it has, I hope,
the full central heating.

38
00:04:22,209 --> 00:04:24,541
- Well, Miss Lemon said
it had all the comforts.

39
00:04:24,834 --> 00:04:27,666
Now, where's a cab?

40
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:30,249
Well, I must say,
it's good to be out of London.

41
00:04:30,542 --> 00:04:32,166
Less traffic, for a start.

42
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:35,791
- Less taxis also,
it would appear.

43
00:04:36,084 --> 00:04:36,916
- Yes.

44
00:04:37,209 --> 00:04:39,291
- I know you.

45
00:04:39,584 --> 00:04:40,374
- It is possible, yes.

46
00:04:40,667 --> 00:04:42,083
- Your face been in the paper.

47
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,333
- Yes, that is true,
on many occasions.

48
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:47,833
- You're Lucky Len,
and I claim my ten guineas.

49
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,249
I've got my paper,
I said the right words,

50
00:04:54,542 --> 00:04:55,333
so where's my money?

51
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:56,499
- Please.
Do you mind?

52
00:04:56,792 --> 00:04:58,541
Grand Metropolitan Hotel,
driver.

53
00:04:58,834 --> 00:05:00,708
- Right-o, guv.

54
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,874
- It's a sort of game, Poirot.

55
00:05:07,167 --> 00:05:08,541
The newspaper prints
a photograph

56
00:05:08,834 --> 00:05:09,874
of this character Lucky Len,

57
00:05:10,167 --> 00:05:12,916
and whoever finds him
gets ten guineas.

58
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,124
- This holiday, Hastings.

59
00:05:18,417 --> 00:05:21,124
Already, I begin to have
the second thoughts.

60
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,999
- Your key, Mr. Worthing.

61
00:05:31,292 --> 00:05:32,458
- Room 113?

62
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,874
- Yes, sir.

63
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,749
It's as you requested:
on the first floor.

64
00:05:37,042 --> 00:05:39,041
- Good.
Thank you.

65
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:49,708
- I'll have your bags
sent up, sir.

66
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,124
- It is most curious, that,
Hastings.

67
00:06:01,417 --> 00:06:03,249
Did you not remark?
- What's what?

68
00:06:03,542 --> 00:06:05,166
- The gentleman that just
booked in ahead of us.

69
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:08,458
- Honestly, Poirot,
you are incorrigible.

70
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,916
- Mr. Poirot, isn't it?

71
00:06:10,209 --> 00:06:11,416
- Yes?

72
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:13,583
- What a great privilege
to have you here

73
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,041
at the Grand Metropolitan.

74
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:16,166
- Thank you.

75
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,249
- Boy?

76
00:06:17,542 --> 00:06:19,624
- You got a nice sea view here.

77
00:06:19,917 --> 00:06:22,291
Bathroom through there.

78
00:06:22,584 --> 00:06:24,708
Two bedrooms.

79
00:06:27,167 --> 00:06:27,958
You going to the race?

80
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,124
- Oh, we might.

81
00:06:29,417 --> 00:06:30,499
- I think not.

82
00:06:30,792 --> 00:06:33,833
- Laughing Boy in the 4:00,
that's my tip.

83
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,833
How about the theater?

84
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,874
There's a new show
opening this week.

85
00:06:38,167 --> 00:06:39,249
I can get you tickets.

86
00:06:39,542 --> 00:06:40,999
- Hastings?

87
00:06:41,292 --> 00:06:43,208
- Well, I reckon
you'd enjoy it, sir,

88
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,666
you being a detective and that.

89
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:48,124
They got a necklace
worth a bundle onstage.

90
00:06:48,417 --> 00:06:49,583
- Yes, I read about that.

91
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:52,749
- Mr. Opalsen, the producer,
he's staying here too,

92
00:06:53,042 --> 00:06:54,333
him and his wife.

93
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:57,374
Oh, thank you, sir.

94
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:02,083
- Un moment, s'il vous plait.

95
00:07:03,792 --> 00:07:05,458
This Monsieur Opalsen,

96
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,374
would you happen to know
which is his room?

97
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:08,666
- Poirot.

98
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:10,374
- Yes, of course I do, sir.

99
00:07:10,667 --> 00:07:12,749
The Imperial Suite, number 114.

100
00:07:13,042 --> 00:07:15,041
Just here, sir.

101
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:17,708
- Merci.

102
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,999
- Ah, here we are,
Laughing Boy in the 4:00.

103
00:07:27,292 --> 00:07:28,083
Seven to one.

104
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,333
Perhaps I will have a try.

105
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,791
- Mr. Poirot--

106
00:07:34,084 --> 00:07:35,749
- I hope you'll forgive me,
Mr. Poirot,

107
00:07:36,042 --> 00:07:37,583
but when I heard
that the famous detective

108
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,708
was staying at the hotel,
I just had to meet him.

109
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,666
- Mr. Poirot,
this is Mr. Opalsen,

110
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:42,999
the producer.

111
00:07:43,292 --> 00:07:44,958
- Ah, yes, of course.

112
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,708
Monsieur Opalsen.

113
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,708
My associate, Captain Hastings,
and myself

114
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,708
have already heard much
about your production.

115
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,416
Will you join us?

116
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:53,499
- Thank you.

117
00:07:53,792 --> 00:07:57,458
Yes, Pearls Before Swine.

118
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,333
It opens tonight.

119
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,916
I'd be honored
if you'd come as my guests.

120
00:08:02,209 --> 00:08:04,124
And to the party afterwards?

121
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:07,083
- Oh, that's jolly decent
of you.

122
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:09,624
- And it is tonight, I think,

123
00:08:09,917 --> 00:08:12,374
that your famous necklace
makes also its debut.

124
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:15,124
- Yes, the maid's just taking it
to the theater now.

125
00:08:15,417 --> 00:08:18,083
Celestine, show Mr. Poirot
the pearls.

126
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,666
Well, get them out of the box.

127
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:25,749
- I can't, sir.

128
00:08:26,042 --> 00:08:27,958
I don't have the key.

129
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,958
- Why not, damn it?
Where'd you put it?

130
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,541
- Mr. Opalsen keeps it, sir.

131
00:08:33,834 --> 00:08:34,624
She insists.

132
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:37,249
- Ugh.
Security.

133
00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:40,416
- You carry the necklace
on your own?

134
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:42,124
- No, sir.

135
00:08:42,417 --> 00:08:44,958
- No, Saunders, my driver,
always goes with her.

136
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,749
As a matter of fact, he's late.

137
00:08:47,042 --> 00:08:51,041
- Then perhaps you will permit
Captain Hastings and myself

138
00:08:51,334 --> 00:08:52,333
to accompany la mademoiselle.

139
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:53,833
- Well, that's very kind.

140
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:54,999
- Not at all.

141
00:08:55,292 --> 00:08:56,666
It is our pleasure,
is it not, Hastings?

142
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,499
- Oh, rather.

143
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,624
- Margaret?

144
00:09:03,917 --> 00:09:04,999
Now, listen, dear.

145
00:09:05,292 --> 00:09:07,999
You'll never guess
who I've just met.

146
00:09:08,292 --> 00:09:09,124
Yup.

147
00:09:09,417 --> 00:09:12,208
It's Poirot, Hercule Poirot.

148
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,249
He's on his way over now.

149
00:09:14,542 --> 00:09:15,374
I know.

150
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:16,583
That's right.

151
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,249
We're going to have to do
something.

152
00:09:24,417 --> 00:09:26,624
- Mademoiselle,
your name of Celestine,

153
00:09:26,917 --> 00:09:28,291
it is French, n'est-ce pas?

154
00:09:28,584 --> 00:09:30,041
- My mother was French, sir,

155
00:09:30,334 --> 00:09:32,249
but I've always lived here.

156
00:09:32,542 --> 00:09:35,208
I was hoping to be
in the theater myself one day.

157
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,374
- Ah.

158
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:38,374
And you have been working
with Monsieur Opalsen

159
00:09:38,667 --> 00:09:39,541
for how long?

160
00:09:39,834 --> 00:09:41,541
- About two years.

161
00:09:41,834 --> 00:09:43,249
He's not normally so edgy, sir.

162
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:45,041
It's just
when there's a first night.

163
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,249
- Have you seen
Pearls Before Swine?

164
00:09:47,542 --> 00:09:50,708
- Only in rehearsal,
but it's beautifully written.

165
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,166
I'm sure Mr. Opalsen has nothing
to worry--

166
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:54,958
- Stop!

167
00:09:56,042 --> 00:09:57,958
Stop.

168
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,833
You are Lucky Len
of the Daily Echo,

169
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,166
and I claim my ten guineas.

170
00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:04,708
- No, madame, I am not Len.

171
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,874
And, therefore, for you,
I am not lucky.

172
00:10:07,167 --> 00:10:08,874
Excuse me.

173
00:10:20,334 --> 00:10:21,666
- Here we are.

174
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:24,541
We can go in the back way.

175
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:28,083
- All right, where is it?

176
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:29,291
- Let me go!

177
00:10:29,584 --> 00:10:30,624
- The money.

178
00:10:30,917 --> 00:10:32,416
- Look, you'll have it.

179
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:33,499
- When?

180
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,541
- Tomorrow.

181
00:10:34,792 --> 00:10:35,666
- You said that yesterday.

182
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:37,916
- No!

183
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:40,083
- Tomorrow.

184
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:41,208
- I promise you.

185
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,666
- Andrew!

186
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,583
- Tomorrow, then, or else.

187
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:48,166
- Give me the bag, mademoiselle.

188
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:52,041
- Are you all right?

189
00:10:52,334 --> 00:10:54,333
- Fine.

190
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,499
They haven't hurt me.

191
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,708
My God, you're Hercule Poirot,
aren't you?

192
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,249
- Oui.

193
00:11:01,542 --> 00:11:04,083
It would appear that you are
in need of assistance, monsieur.

194
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:05,624
- Me?

195
00:11:05,917 --> 00:11:07,874
No, no, those are just

196
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,458
what you might call
business associates.

197
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,624
It's nothing I can't handle.

198
00:11:13,917 --> 00:11:15,208
- This is Andrew Hall,

199
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,874
the writer
I was telling you about.

200
00:11:17,167 --> 00:11:18,749
- Ah, Monsieur Hall.

201
00:11:19,042 --> 00:11:20,958
- So it's your play.

202
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,708
- It's Ed Opalsen's play.

203
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,333
He bought it, cut it,
rewrote it,

204
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:27,166
and left me with about 2% of it.

205
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:29,416
Hence my current difficulties.

206
00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:31,916
- Are you sure you're all right?

207
00:11:32,209 --> 00:11:33,208
- Yes.

208
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,666
- I have to go in.

209
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:35,749
- I'll come with you.

210
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,124
- Thank you, Mr. Poirot.

211
00:11:38,417 --> 00:11:40,374
- Mademoiselle.

212
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,041
You know, Hastings,

213
00:11:51,334 --> 00:11:53,833
I begin, I think,
to look forward to this play.

214
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,749
- Glad to hear it.

215
00:11:56,042 --> 00:11:57,708
- Thank you.

216
00:12:00,292 --> 00:12:01,708
- I'll go.

217
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,958
- Thank you, Hastings.

218
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,083
- Ah.

219
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:09,166
- Mr. Poirot?

220
00:12:09,459 --> 00:12:10,749
- I am Poirot.

221
00:12:11,042 --> 00:12:12,833
- Ah.

222
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,791
My name is Saunders, sir.

223
00:12:15,084 --> 00:12:17,083
Mr. Opalsen's chauffeur.

224
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:18,583
- Yes?

225
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:21,333
- Mr. Opalsen has sent me
to take you to the theater, sir,

226
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:22,833
with his compliments.

227
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,666
- Thank you.

228
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,666
- Here he comes.

229
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,458
Mr. Poirot?
- Mr. Poirot.

230
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,416
Have you been challenged
to solve the play, sir?

231
00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:35,999
- This I do not believe.
Hastings!

232
00:12:36,292 --> 00:12:38,833
- Mr. Poirot, how many acts
do you think it will take?

233
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,249
- Excuse me!

234
00:12:40,542 --> 00:12:41,791
It is an outrage, Hastings,

235
00:12:42,084 --> 00:12:44,124
to use Hercule Poirot
for the publicity of this play.

236
00:12:44,417 --> 00:12:45,208
- Absolutely.

237
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,458
It's beginning.

238
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:51,166
- Inspector Drake should be here
pretty soon.

239
00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:54,833
- Oh, is Inspector Drake
really coming here?

240
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:57,541
I've read so much about him
in the newspapers.

241
00:12:57,834 --> 00:12:59,958
- Oh, yes, Inspector Drake and I
have worked together

242
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,874
quite a lot recently.

243
00:13:02,167 --> 00:13:03,624
- Good luck, my dear.

244
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:06,124
- And you're a mere
local sergeant.

245
00:13:06,417 --> 00:13:08,666
Oh, here's Inspector Drake
coming now.

246
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,666
Shh!
Good evening, sir.

247
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,458
My lady will be here presently.

248
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,291
- Good.
I must speak to her at once.

249
00:13:14,584 --> 00:13:16,083
- My dear inspector.

250
00:13:18,167 --> 00:13:19,874
- Forgive me, Lady Jane,

251
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:23,249
but I don't think
you should be wearing that.

252
00:13:23,542 --> 00:13:26,541
- The necklace?
Whyever not?

253
00:13:26,834 --> 00:13:31,083
- Because the Phantom has sworn
to have it,

254
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:37,083
and the Phantom
has never once failed.

255
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:39,624
- I think it's about time

256
00:13:39,917 --> 00:13:42,166
we made an appearance
at the party.

257
00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:44,499
Well, you're not going to wear
the pearls?

258
00:13:44,792 --> 00:13:47,333
- I'm tired of being upstaged
by them.

259
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:48,666
Celestine.

260
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,249
- Yes, Mrs. Opalsen.

261
00:13:50,542 --> 00:13:52,791
- Is it safe
just leaving them there?

262
00:13:53,084 --> 00:13:55,583
- Of course.
Celestine won't leave the room.

263
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:58,041
- More champagne?
- No, thank you.

264
00:13:59,334 --> 00:14:00,916
- I don't see why
you don't wear the pearls.

265
00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:02,291
It's good publicity.

266
00:14:02,584 --> 00:14:04,291
- That's all
you ever think about.

267
00:14:04,584 --> 00:14:06,499
Now, you heard what I said,
didn't you, Celestine?

268
00:14:06,792 --> 00:14:07,791
- Yes, mum.

269
00:14:08,084 --> 00:14:10,083
- I'll have your supper sent up
to you.

270
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,374
There.

271
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,124
- Come on, then.

272
00:14:23,417 --> 00:14:26,291
Time to play host and hostess.

273
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:40,416
- Thank you.

274
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:46,541
- I hope you enjoy
the party, sir.

275
00:14:46,834 --> 00:14:47,666
- Thank you.

276
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:49,583
Oh, pardon.
You will forgive me?

277
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,249
- Oh.

278
00:14:51,542 --> 00:14:52,708
Thank you very much, sir.

279
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,291
- Not at all.

280
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,999
- I'll be waiting
for you here, sir.

281
00:14:59,292 --> 00:15:01,499
- Thank you.

282
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,083
- Who is it?

283
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,333
- Maid, mum.
Got your supper for you.

284
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,833
- One moment.

285
00:15:13,167 --> 00:15:14,041
That's very kind of you.

286
00:15:14,334 --> 00:15:15,333
- All part of the service.

287
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:16,708
Do you want me to carry it in?

288
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,083
- Yes, put it over there.

289
00:15:21,209 --> 00:15:22,458
- All on your own, are you?

290
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,666
- Yes.

291
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:24,874
- That's a shame.

292
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:26,999
All the rest of them
at the party.

293
00:15:27,292 --> 00:15:28,333
Tell you what.

294
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,916
I'll sit with you, if you like.

295
00:15:33,209 --> 00:15:34,791
- Thank you.

296
00:15:35,084 --> 00:15:37,291
My name's Grace,
Grace Wilson.

297
00:15:37,584 --> 00:15:39,874
So how do you like
the Grand Metropolitan?

298
00:15:40,167 --> 00:15:42,541
- Let us say it was an evening
I shall not easily forget.

299
00:15:42,834 --> 00:15:44,208
- Ah, Mr. Poirot.

300
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,291
- Excuse me.

301
00:15:45,542 --> 00:15:46,833
- I'm delighted
you could make it.

302
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:49,291
- Monsieur.
Madame.

303
00:15:49,584 --> 00:15:52,041
Monsieur Opalsen,
at the theater this evening,

304
00:15:52,334 --> 00:15:53,874
there were some journalists
awaiting me.

305
00:15:54,167 --> 00:15:56,166
This was not, I think,
a coincidence.

306
00:15:56,459 --> 00:15:57,749
- Uh, no.

307
00:15:58,042 --> 00:16:01,458
But a man in my position needs
all the publicity he can get.

308
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,833
- I bet you'd guessed
who'd stolen the pearls

309
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:05,791
by the second interval,
Monsieur Poirot.

310
00:16:06,084 --> 00:16:07,124
- Not at all, madame.

311
00:16:07,417 --> 00:16:09,791
It was a question
that ceased to occupy my mind

312
00:16:10,084 --> 00:16:12,124
long before the first.

313
00:16:12,417 --> 00:16:13,666
Excuse me.

314
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:17,749
- They're not really that bad.

315
00:16:18,042 --> 00:16:19,208
- Oh, you should try this job.

316
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,916
I could tell you a thing or two.

317
00:16:21,209 --> 00:16:22,916
- Have you worked here long?

318
00:16:23,209 --> 00:16:25,541
- Not here, no...

319
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,624
- Mr. Poirot.

320
00:16:48,917 --> 00:16:50,541
Hubert Devine.

321
00:16:50,834 --> 00:16:52,791
I played the detective, Drake.

322
00:16:53,084 --> 00:16:54,583
- Ah, yes, of course.

323
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,874
I found your performance
most engaging.

324
00:16:58,167 --> 00:16:59,458
- It's a jolly good play.

325
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,999
- Yes, I think it's going to be
a success.

326
00:17:02,292 --> 00:17:04,583
And just as well.

327
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,374
Dear Ed needs a winner.

328
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:10,374
Well, three disasters
last season.

329
00:17:10,667 --> 00:17:13,416
He only had one success,
and that was a revival.

330
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:15,541
Oh, yes.

331
00:17:17,792 --> 00:17:19,791
If Pearls doesn't run,

332
00:17:20,084 --> 00:17:22,791
I'd say he was finished.

333
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,208
- I do like these telegrams.

334
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,874
They're really nice.

335
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:33,541
They always send them?
- Mm.

336
00:17:33,834 --> 00:17:36,249
Oh, I need some scissors.

337
00:17:36,542 --> 00:17:38,999
- I can get you some,
if you like.

338
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:41,291
- No, it's all right;
I've got some somewhere.

339
00:17:41,584 --> 00:17:43,749
Oh, I hate sewing.

340
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,499
- Good night.
Thank you.

341
00:17:47,792 --> 00:17:49,041
- Did you enjoy yourself, sir?

342
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:50,874
- Yes, thank you, Saunders.

343
00:17:51,167 --> 00:17:52,249
But now, you know, the fatigue.

344
00:17:52,542 --> 00:17:53,749
- Well, it is after midnight.

345
00:17:54,042 --> 00:17:55,458
- Yes, indeed, Hastings.

346
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,249
Thank you.

347
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:03,124
- We're back, Celestine.

348
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:04,333
Everything all right?

349
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,333
- Yes, mum.
Everything's fine.

350
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,624
- What a dreary party.

351
00:18:08,917 --> 00:18:11,874
- Well, you weren't exactly
glittering yourself, my dear.

352
00:18:12,167 --> 00:18:14,374
- And you drank too much.

353
00:18:14,667 --> 00:18:16,249
- Why not?
I paid for it.

354
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:18,833
- Celestine, my jewelry box.

355
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,333
- Yes, mum.

356
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:26,499
- That damn writer Andrew Hall
didn't even bother to show up.

357
00:18:26,792 --> 00:18:28,749
- I saw him leave the theater.

358
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:29,833
He was avoiding you.

359
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:31,208
- Are you inferring something?

360
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,749
- No.

361
00:18:33,042 --> 00:18:35,249
Here's the key.

362
00:18:35,542 --> 00:18:37,374
Are you still drinking?

363
00:18:37,667 --> 00:18:39,124
- Yes.
Do you want one?

364
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:45,166
- Sir?

365
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:47,541
Mrs. Opalsen.

366
00:18:47,834 --> 00:18:49,749
- What is it?

367
00:18:50,042 --> 00:18:52,333
- The necklace.

368
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:55,708
I don't understand it.
It's not here.

369
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,208
- What do you mean,
it's not there?

370
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,333
It's got to be.

371
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,374
- Out of the way.
Let me look.

372
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:04,749
For heaven's sake.

373
00:19:05,042 --> 00:19:07,333
Call the police.

374
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:10,541
Someone has stolen my pearls!

375
00:19:16,917 --> 00:19:19,249
- I take it, Monsieur Opalsen,

376
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:22,249
that you have summoned
the police?

377
00:19:25,042 --> 00:19:27,041
- Yes, of course.

378
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:28,791
They're sending someone down
from London.

379
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,624
But that's not good enough.

380
00:19:30,917 --> 00:19:32,708
I want you, Mr. Poirot.

381
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,916
- Ah.

382
00:19:34,209 --> 00:19:37,333
- I beg of you.
I've got to get them back.

383
00:19:41,292 --> 00:19:46,083
- And these pearls,
they were, without doubt,

384
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:47,499
insured?

385
00:19:47,792 --> 00:19:51,708
- Well, yes, but--
but that's not the point.

386
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,916
The play, Mr. Poirot,

387
00:19:54,209 --> 00:19:56,874
all the publicity
about the pearls.

388
00:19:57,167 --> 00:19:58,999
If they aren't returned,
I'll be a laughingstock.

389
00:19:59,292 --> 00:20:00,624
We have an American tour.

390
00:20:00,917 --> 00:20:03,708
How can we do Pearls
Before Swine with no pearls?

391
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,458
- Poirot?

392
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,541
- Excuse me.

393
00:20:06,834 --> 00:20:08,083
Mon cher Hastings?

394
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,541
- The doctor.
- Comment?

395
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:13,416
- I just think you ought
to remember why you're here.

396
00:20:13,709 --> 00:20:15,208
- Yes, that is true.

397
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,624
But, Hastings--

398
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:27,208
Monsieur Opalsen,

399
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,708
I regret that Poirot
cannot help you in this matter.

400
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,791
- What?

401
00:20:34,084 --> 00:20:36,916
- I am here

402
00:20:37,209 --> 00:20:39,749
en vacances.

403
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,124
- Ah, morning, Poirot.

404
00:20:47,417 --> 00:20:49,499
- Bonjour, Chief Inspector Japp.

405
00:20:56,292 --> 00:20:59,333
- Imperial Suite, please.

406
00:21:03,167 --> 00:21:06,041
- I took the necklace off
before the party

407
00:21:06,334 --> 00:21:08,333
and put it in my jewelry box.

408
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:11,624
And then I put the box
in the drawer.

409
00:21:11,917 --> 00:21:14,041
- Was the drawer locked?

410
00:21:14,334 --> 00:21:15,374
- No, it wasn't.

411
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:19,083
Celestine was here,
so I felt there was no need.

412
00:21:20,834 --> 00:21:23,333
- How many keys are there
to this box, Mrs. Opalsen?

413
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:27,041
- Only one, and I keep it
with me all the time.

414
00:21:27,334 --> 00:21:28,291
- You're sure of that?

415
00:21:28,584 --> 00:21:30,666
It doesn't seem
to have been forced.

416
00:21:30,959 --> 00:21:33,166
- Of course I'm sure.

417
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:36,624
There's only ever been one key.

418
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:46,083
- I'm going to offer a reward,
Chief Inspector, a big one.

419
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:47,416
You think that'll help?

420
00:21:47,709 --> 00:21:49,624
- It may, sir.

421
00:21:52,917 --> 00:21:55,999
So what were you doing
when all this was going on?

422
00:21:56,292 --> 00:21:58,708
- I was doing the sewing, sir.

423
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,958
I only went
into the side room...

424
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:06,291
The first time for scissors
and later for thread.

425
00:22:09,459 --> 00:22:11,708
- Look at the little boats
over there.

426
00:22:19,459 --> 00:22:21,208
- Oh, cheer up, Poirot.

427
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,249
It is for the best.

428
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:25,458
- I have no doubt, Hastings.

429
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,541
- Well, you're here for a rest.

430
00:22:27,834 --> 00:22:29,541
If you're going to get involved
in another case,

431
00:22:29,834 --> 00:22:31,499
you might just as well
have stayed in London.

432
00:22:31,792 --> 00:22:33,291
- It is true.

433
00:22:33,584 --> 00:22:35,208
- I don't know why
you can't just sit back

434
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,416
and enjoy the sea air.

435
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:42,583
- I know you.

436
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:43,708
- No, no, no, Hastings.

437
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,083
It is no use.

438
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:46,624
Not to take this case is,
for Poirot,

439
00:22:46,917 --> 00:22:49,249
more hard work
than to take it.

440
00:22:55,209 --> 00:22:57,208
- Saunders, get the car started.

441
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,458
I'm in a hurry.

442
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,166
- Monsieur Hall.
- What?

443
00:23:00,459 --> 00:23:01,958
Oh, um, Mr. Poirot.

444
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,249
I'm afraid I can't stop.

445
00:23:03,542 --> 00:23:04,916
- You've heard, then,
about the pearls?

446
00:23:05,209 --> 00:23:06,124
- Yes.

447
00:23:06,417 --> 00:23:07,958
What was it
about life imitating art?

448
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,124
Serves Ed right.

449
00:23:09,417 --> 00:23:12,041
Anyway, it's not my problem.

450
00:23:12,334 --> 00:23:13,416
- Monsieur Hall?

451
00:23:13,709 --> 00:23:15,541
I noticed that you were not
at the party last night.

452
00:23:15,834 --> 00:23:17,666
- Well, I wasn't
in a party mood.

453
00:23:17,959 --> 00:23:18,958
- May I ask where you were?

454
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,416
- I went for a walk.

455
00:23:20,709 --> 00:23:23,333
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I really will be late.

456
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:26,208
Thank you, Saunders.

457
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:36,374
- I only stayed with her
'cause I felt sorry for her.

458
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:38,541
- So you were alone in the room
with the necklace.

459
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,708
- Yeah, for about two seconds.

460
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,208
Didn't even know it was there.

461
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,374
Blooming cheek.

462
00:23:44,667 --> 00:23:45,916
- Chief Inspector?

463
00:23:46,209 --> 00:23:48,291
- Ah, hello, Poirot.

464
00:23:48,584 --> 00:23:49,583
- Excuse us, mademoiselle.

465
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:51,333
- Thought you were
sitting this one out.

466
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:53,749
- Well--
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

467
00:23:54,042 --> 00:23:56,208
So how goes the investigation?

468
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,374
- Pretty routine.

469
00:23:57,667 --> 00:23:58,916
- Have you got
any more questions?

470
00:23:59,209 --> 00:24:00,166
I've got a ton of work.

471
00:24:00,459 --> 00:24:01,791
- Oh, no, that's all right,
Miss Wilson.

472
00:24:02,084 --> 00:24:04,291
That's all for now.

473
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:07,833
Grace Wilson.

474
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:09,541
Been with the hotel
a couple of months.

475
00:24:09,834 --> 00:24:13,458
Barmaid before that,
Dog and Duck in Holborn.

476
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:16,083
She took that girl Celestine
her supper.

477
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:18,791
First floor, please.

478
00:24:19,084 --> 00:24:21,291
- So tell me, Chief Inspector.

479
00:24:21,584 --> 00:24:23,874
What is it
that you have so far found out?

480
00:24:29,292 --> 00:24:31,291
- Grace Wilson or Celestine.

481
00:24:31,584 --> 00:24:33,833
The hotel maid
or the ladies' maid.

482
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:35,666
Seems to me
it's got to be one of them.

483
00:24:35,959 --> 00:24:38,291
- A necklace in a box
within a chest, Chief Inspector,

484
00:24:38,584 --> 00:24:39,791
and only one key?

485
00:24:40,084 --> 00:24:42,666
It is as a magical trick.

486
00:24:52,917 --> 00:24:54,916
The necklace,
it was in this drawer?

487
00:24:55,209 --> 00:24:56,416
- That's right.

488
00:24:59,542 --> 00:25:00,999
- And this door?

489
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:02,458
- Oh, that leads
to the maid's room.

490
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,999
That's where Celestine went
to get the scissors and thread.

491
00:25:05,292 --> 00:25:07,708
- Leaving Grace alone
in the room.

492
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,624
- Tell me, Hastings,
how long do you think

493
00:25:10,917 --> 00:25:12,458
it would have taken
Mademoiselle Celestine

494
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,541
to retrieve the scissors
from that room?

495
00:25:14,834 --> 00:25:17,124
- Oh, I don't know.
20 seconds?

496
00:25:17,417 --> 00:25:19,124
- 20 seconds.

497
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:20,333
And for how much of that time

498
00:25:20,625 --> 00:25:22,458
would she have been
out of this room?

499
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,791
- Four or five seconds
at the most.

500
00:25:25,084 --> 00:25:27,333
- Exactement.

501
00:25:29,084 --> 00:25:31,374
And for
Mademoiselle Grace Wilson

502
00:25:31,667 --> 00:25:33,374
to open this drawer,
remove the box,

503
00:25:33,667 --> 00:25:35,124
somehow to unlock it,
open the box,

504
00:25:35,417 --> 00:25:37,333
take out the necklace,
close the box,

505
00:25:37,625 --> 00:25:38,833
and return it?

506
00:25:39,125 --> 00:25:40,958
- Well, she couldn't possibly
have had time.

507
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,874
- I do not think so.

508
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:44,791
- Right.

509
00:25:45,084 --> 00:25:46,833
Excuse me.

510
00:25:47,125 --> 00:25:48,874
- Where are you going,
Chief Inspector?

511
00:25:49,167 --> 00:25:53,541
- I think it's about time
I had Miss Celestine searched.

512
00:25:55,334 --> 00:25:58,249
- Can't imagine why
they didn't lock it.

513
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,874
- This drawer runs easily,
Hastings.

514
00:26:09,917 --> 00:26:12,124
But not this one.

515
00:26:20,334 --> 00:26:23,166
C'est interessant.

516
00:26:23,459 --> 00:26:25,958
I wonder...

517
00:26:29,375 --> 00:26:32,583
- Well, that must interconnect
with the room next door.

518
00:26:32,875 --> 00:26:35,124
- It is bolted.

519
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,208
Bolted on both sides.

520
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:46,624
But, Hastings, we know who it is
who occupies this room.

521
00:26:46,917 --> 00:26:48,708
- Room 113?

522
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,791
- Oui.

523
00:26:50,084 --> 00:26:53,708
His name, I think,
was Mr. Worthing.

524
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,083
- That's right, sir.

525
00:26:55,375 --> 00:26:56,333
He was an American gent.

526
00:26:56,625 --> 00:26:57,624
He only stayed the night.

527
00:26:57,917 --> 00:27:00,083
Left this morning.

528
00:27:00,375 --> 00:27:02,208
- You saw him depart?

529
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,374
- Oh, no, sir.

530
00:27:03,667 --> 00:27:05,374
Carried his own luggage.

531
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:07,874
Must have left
at the crack of dawn.

532
00:27:08,167 --> 00:27:11,541
- You did not, by chance,
see him yesterday evening?

533
00:27:11,834 --> 00:27:14,291
- No, sir.

534
00:27:14,584 --> 00:27:16,708
I can tell you
who I did see, though, sir.

535
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,666
Well, it was
just as I was leaving.

536
00:27:19,959 --> 00:27:22,416
Well, I don't want to talk
out of turn, sir,

537
00:27:22,709 --> 00:27:25,999
but, well, if there's a reward
and all that, well...

538
00:27:26,292 --> 00:27:27,833
- Please to continue.

539
00:27:28,125 --> 00:27:29,041
- Yeah.

540
00:27:29,334 --> 00:27:30,999
Well, that writer, Mr. Hall,

541
00:27:31,292 --> 00:27:33,541
he was hanging around
outside the hotel.

542
00:27:33,834 --> 00:27:37,916
Must have been about 11:00.

543
00:27:38,209 --> 00:27:40,124
- Outside?
- Yes, sir.

544
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,541
- Would he have been
near to the window

545
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:50,374
of Monsieur and Madame Opalsen?

546
00:27:50,667 --> 00:27:53,499
- Well, yes, sir.

547
00:27:53,792 --> 00:27:55,666
Right under it.

548
00:27:55,959 --> 00:27:58,291
- Thank you.

549
00:28:10,375 --> 00:28:11,499
- Well.

550
00:28:11,792 --> 00:28:14,541
Now, here's something
that shouldn't be here.

551
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,458
- That's a duplicate key
to the jewel box.

552
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:31,208
We found it hidden in the hem
of Celestine's petticoat.

553
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,416
- Sounds pretty conclusive.

554
00:28:33,709 --> 00:28:34,916
But what about the necklace?

555
00:28:35,209 --> 00:28:36,041
- No sign of that yet.

556
00:28:36,334 --> 00:28:37,874
- Going up,
ladies and gentlemen.

557
00:28:38,167 --> 00:28:41,874
- But if you say her boyfriend
was seen

558
00:28:42,167 --> 00:28:44,541
outside the hotel last night...

559
00:28:47,167 --> 00:28:49,624
- Monsieur Hall?
He was here, yes.

560
00:28:49,917 --> 00:28:51,624
- Yes, well, that explains it,
doesn't it?

561
00:28:51,917 --> 00:28:53,374
- Explains what?

562
00:28:53,667 --> 00:28:55,124
- How she got the necklace
out of the hotel.

563
00:28:55,417 --> 00:28:56,291
She couldn't leave the room,

564
00:28:56,584 --> 00:28:58,041
so she simply dropped it
out of the window,

565
00:28:58,334 --> 00:28:59,291
and he was there to catch it.

566
00:28:59,584 --> 00:29:01,291
- You have arrested
Mademoiselle Celestine?

567
00:29:01,584 --> 00:29:04,708
- Yes, and the sooner we find
Andrew Hall, the better.

568
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,791
Ah, Mr. Saunders.

569
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:13,916
We want a word with you.

570
00:29:17,917 --> 00:29:20,374
- I hear you've already solved
the case, sir.

571
00:29:20,667 --> 00:29:23,041
- Never mind about that.
Have you seen Mr. Hall?

572
00:29:23,334 --> 00:29:24,624
- Mr. Hall, sir?

573
00:29:24,917 --> 00:29:27,041
I drove him to the race course.

574
00:29:27,334 --> 00:29:28,833
Is he in some sort of trouble,
sir?

575
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:30,291
- He could be
in a lot of trouble.

576
00:29:30,584 --> 00:29:31,874
Why do you ask?

577
00:29:32,167 --> 00:29:36,541
- Well, he did seem
a little anxious.

578
00:29:36,834 --> 00:29:38,041
- I'm not surprised.

579
00:29:38,334 --> 00:29:40,583
Have you any idea
where we might find him?

580
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:44,708
- Well, he always places
his bets with the same man,

581
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,791
Harry Wax.

582
00:29:47,084 --> 00:29:48,708
- Harry Wax?

583
00:29:50,542 --> 00:29:51,874
- He's a bookie, sir.

584
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:15,124
- Just the sort of place
I'd expect him to go.

585
00:30:15,417 --> 00:30:16,583
- What do you mean,
Chief Inspector?

586
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:18,166
- A race course.

587
00:30:18,459 --> 00:30:20,791
This is where you'll find
every criminal element, Poirot.

588
00:30:21,084 --> 00:30:22,958
And what better place
to do this kind of business

589
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:24,583
than in the middle of a crowd?

590
00:30:24,875 --> 00:30:25,916
I only hope we're not too late.

591
00:30:26,209 --> 00:30:27,458
We've got
all the entrances covered?

592
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:28,541
- Yes, sir.
- Right.

593
00:30:28,792 --> 00:30:29,874
You lot come with me,

594
00:30:30,167 --> 00:30:32,041
and keep your eyes out
for a bookie called Harry Wax.

595
00:30:32,334 --> 00:30:33,124
All right, come on, lads.

596
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:34,791
- Hastings, this is wrong.

597
00:30:35,084 --> 00:30:37,416
To Poirot, it makes no sense.

598
00:30:39,709 --> 00:30:42,958
- 45, 50,

599
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:45,791
55, 60.

600
00:30:46,084 --> 00:30:47,833
- Next race is the...

601
00:30:48,125 --> 00:30:50,458
- Take six to four,
This Favorite,

602
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:53,041
and four to one Balwon.

603
00:30:53,334 --> 00:30:54,958
Take six to...

604
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,583
Take six to four--

605
00:31:14,584 --> 00:31:15,791
- You Harry Wax?
- Yeah.

606
00:31:16,084 --> 00:31:17,291
- Is there a tall,
blond-haired chap

607
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:18,708
made a bet this morning?

608
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,624
- Poirot!

609
00:31:27,167 --> 00:31:29,833
There's Mr. Worthing.
I could have sworn it.

610
00:31:30,917 --> 00:31:32,124
- Oi!

611
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,291
There he is!

612
00:31:38,875 --> 00:31:39,874
Halt!

613
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,583
- You can't come in here.

614
00:31:50,334 --> 00:31:52,458
- Stop him!
Stop him!

615
00:31:55,209 --> 00:31:56,999
Get him!

616
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,624
- Come on.

617
00:32:04,959 --> 00:32:06,458
- Right.
Get him in the car.

618
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,124
- All right, in the car.
Come on.

619
00:32:08,417 --> 00:32:10,458
- I'm afraid we got to him
just too late.

620
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,749
But we found this and this.

621
00:32:13,042 --> 00:32:13,916
- The pearls.

622
00:32:14,209 --> 00:32:15,708
- No, just the pouch
they were kept in.

623
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,916
Empty.

624
00:32:17,209 --> 00:32:20,124
- So what's happened
to the pearls?

625
00:32:53,542 --> 00:32:55,499
- You've got it all wrong,
Chief Inspector.

626
00:32:55,792 --> 00:32:59,333
- Ah, so I suppose you won
this lot on a horse, did you?

627
00:32:59,625 --> 00:33:00,833
- Yes.

628
00:33:01,125 --> 00:33:02,958
Laughing Boy came in
at seven to one.

629
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,499
- Then why did you try and run
for it when you saw me?

630
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:07,749
- I owe money.

631
00:33:08,042 --> 00:33:09,416
I've had a bad run

632
00:33:09,709 --> 00:33:11,458
and fell in
with some pretty bad company.

633
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,166
Well, you saw
what they were like

634
00:33:13,459 --> 00:33:14,374
outside the theater.

635
00:33:14,667 --> 00:33:16,208
- Yes.

636
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,458
- I didn't know who you were,
so...

637
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:25,124
- How do you explain this?

638
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:33,541
- I can't.

639
00:33:33,834 --> 00:33:34,874
I've never seen it before.

640
00:33:35,167 --> 00:33:36,124
- It was in your pocket.

641
00:33:36,417 --> 00:33:39,041
- Then somebody must have
put it there.

642
00:33:39,334 --> 00:33:41,291
- Chief Inspector?

643
00:33:43,375 --> 00:33:46,708
Monsieur Hall.

644
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,583
Why did you not go to the party
of Monsieur Opalsen?

645
00:33:50,875 --> 00:33:52,208
- I've told you.

646
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,999
I went for a walk.

647
00:33:54,292 --> 00:33:58,291
- And your walk took you back
to the Grand Metropolitan Hotel.

648
00:34:00,709 --> 00:34:02,708
- Yes.

649
00:34:06,542 --> 00:34:09,958
I wanted to see Celestine.

650
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,499
I just needed to be with her.

651
00:34:11,792 --> 00:34:17,666
But then, when I saw
she wasn't alone,

652
00:34:17,959 --> 00:34:20,999
I went to bed.

653
00:34:27,292 --> 00:34:30,124
- Mr. Poirot,
you've got to believe me.

654
00:34:30,417 --> 00:34:32,541
I'd never seen that key before.

655
00:34:32,834 --> 00:34:33,958
Someone must have
hidden it there.

656
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:36,916
- Now, now, now, now, now,
mon petit.

657
00:34:37,209 --> 00:34:39,541
Tell me, about Monsieur Hall,

658
00:34:39,834 --> 00:34:42,083
you know of his gambling?

659
00:34:42,375 --> 00:34:43,916
- Yes.

660
00:34:44,209 --> 00:34:47,749
I've tried to stop him,
but it's no good.

661
00:34:48,042 --> 00:34:49,874
It's like a disease.

662
00:34:50,167 --> 00:34:51,208
- And you are aware,
mademoiselle,

663
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,833
that for the return
of these pearls,

664
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:55,999
Monsieur Opalsen is offering
a reward most substantial?

665
00:34:56,292 --> 00:34:58,083
- Yes.

666
00:34:58,375 --> 00:35:01,583
But I didn't take them,
Mr. Poirot, I swear to you.

667
00:35:01,875 --> 00:35:04,708
- But nobody else came into
the room while you were there.

668
00:35:05,875 --> 00:35:08,208
- No,

669
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,374
only the hotel maid.

670
00:35:10,667 --> 00:35:12,708
- Tell me,
Mademoiselle Celestine.

671
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,333
Monsieur Hall,
how did you first meet?

672
00:35:19,459 --> 00:35:21,416
- It was at the theater.

673
00:35:21,709 --> 00:35:24,083
One of Mr. Opalsen's
productions.

674
00:35:24,375 --> 00:35:26,291
An Oscar Wilde.

675
00:35:26,584 --> 00:35:28,583
- Lady Windermere's Fan?

676
00:35:28,875 --> 00:35:31,791
- No.

677
00:35:32,084 --> 00:35:35,249
It was The Importance
of Being Earnest.

678
00:35:37,417 --> 00:35:40,291
- Of course.

679
00:35:45,334 --> 00:35:47,999
Hastings, I must contact
the good Miss Lemon in London.

680
00:35:48,292 --> 00:35:49,083
- What for?

681
00:35:49,334 --> 00:35:50,916
- This case, Hastings,
I begin to see the light.

682
00:35:51,209 --> 00:35:52,166
- I don't understand.

683
00:35:52,459 --> 00:35:53,749
- You heard
what the young lady said.

684
00:35:54,042 --> 00:35:54,833
- Oscar Wilde?

685
00:35:55,125 --> 00:35:56,749
- Exactement.

686
00:35:57,042 --> 00:36:00,083
Hastings, there is work
to be done.

687
00:36:22,834 --> 00:36:24,708
- Left to get married
about six months ago.

688
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,333
- Really?

689
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:43,624
- Good shooting,
Chief Inspector.

690
00:36:43,917 --> 00:36:45,333
- I used to go out
on Isleworth Marshes

691
00:36:45,625 --> 00:36:46,791
when I was a boy.

692
00:36:47,084 --> 00:36:48,749
Some things you never forget.

693
00:36:49,042 --> 00:36:51,166
- Well, I must say, it's nice
to have an evening off.

694
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,666
- What's Poirot up to, then?

695
00:36:52,959 --> 00:36:53,791
- Thinking.

696
00:36:54,084 --> 00:36:55,124
- Oh.

697
00:36:55,417 --> 00:36:56,958
- This was meant to be a rest,
you know.

698
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:00,874
Heaven knows what Miss Lemon's
going to say when she arrives.

699
00:37:01,167 --> 00:37:02,041
- Hello, sir.

700
00:37:02,334 --> 00:37:03,708
Evening, Chief Inspector.

701
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,416
- Hello, Miss Wilson.

702
00:37:05,709 --> 00:37:07,333
- It's nice to see
the police is human too.

703
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:09,791
That for your little boy?

704
00:37:10,084 --> 00:37:10,916
- Yes.

705
00:37:11,209 --> 00:37:12,291
- I'm glad I ran into you.

706
00:37:12,584 --> 00:37:14,083
There's something
I was wanting to tell you.

707
00:37:14,375 --> 00:37:15,374
- Oh, yes?
What's that?

708
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:18,666
- Well, it may not mean nothing,
but it's that writer.

709
00:37:18,959 --> 00:37:19,958
- What about him?

710
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:22,624
- Well, I saw him
in Mr. Opalsen's room

711
00:37:22,917 --> 00:37:24,791
day before
that necklace got swiped.

712
00:37:25,084 --> 00:37:26,291
He was there
when I did the cleaning.

713
00:37:26,584 --> 00:37:27,916
Said he was looking
for something,

714
00:37:28,209 --> 00:37:29,416
but I don't know.

715
00:37:29,709 --> 00:37:30,541
Anyway...

716
00:37:30,834 --> 00:37:33,249
- The day before.

717
00:37:44,125 --> 00:37:45,999
- Mr. Poirot?

718
00:37:46,292 --> 00:37:47,916
- Ah, Miss Lemon.

719
00:37:48,209 --> 00:37:49,458
Allow me to take your case.

720
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,541
- Thank you.

721
00:37:58,792 --> 00:38:00,624
- Good morning, Miss Lemon.

722
00:38:02,292 --> 00:38:05,124
- I thought this was meant
to be a holiday,

723
00:38:05,417 --> 00:38:06,458
Captain Hastings.

724
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,708
I'll talk to you later.

725
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,041
- Poirot?

726
00:38:16,209 --> 00:38:17,666
What are you up to, Poirot?

727
00:38:17,959 --> 00:38:21,083
- Chief Inspector, you must make
an immediate arrest.

728
00:38:21,375 --> 00:38:23,291
- I've already made an arrest,
thank you very much.

729
00:38:23,584 --> 00:38:25,166
- Chief Inspector,
what if this case

730
00:38:25,459 --> 00:38:27,749
was not just a question of theft
but of fraud?

731
00:38:28,042 --> 00:38:30,999
And what also
if the pearls of the czar

732
00:38:31,292 --> 00:38:33,458
did not exist?

733
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:35,499
- There's Mr. Opalsen.

734
00:38:35,792 --> 00:38:37,583
Can we have a statement,
please, sir?

735
00:38:37,875 --> 00:38:38,708
Can we have a statement?

736
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,208
- Make a statement,
Chief Inspector.

737
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,041
- Mr. Opalsen?

738
00:38:42,334 --> 00:38:43,333
- Poirot!

739
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:45,333
How dare you?

740
00:38:45,625 --> 00:38:46,791
- But, Monsieur Opalsen,

741
00:38:47,084 --> 00:38:51,791
a man in your position needs
all the publicity he can get.

742
00:38:52,834 --> 00:38:53,874
- Mr. Opalsen.

743
00:38:54,167 --> 00:38:55,499
- Could you tell us
what's going on, sir?

744
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:57,416
- Following our investigations,
we discovered

745
00:38:57,709 --> 00:38:59,291
that the necklace
that was stolen was a fake.

746
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,791
There never were
any real pearls.

747
00:39:01,084 --> 00:39:02,333
- You mean he did it
for the insurance,

748
00:39:02,625 --> 00:39:03,416
Chief Inspector?

749
00:39:03,709 --> 00:39:05,291
- We are now investigating
the possibility

750
00:39:05,584 --> 00:39:06,541
of an insurance fraud.

751
00:39:06,834 --> 00:39:08,249
That's all I can tell you
for the present.

752
00:39:08,542 --> 00:39:09,374
Thank you.

753
00:39:09,667 --> 00:39:10,833
- One more question, sir.

754
00:39:11,125 --> 00:39:12,624
What made you think
the pearls were fake?

755
00:39:14,542 --> 00:39:16,916
- Mr. Opalsen?
- Mr. Opalsen.

756
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:26,083
- Oh, yes, Inspector Drake
and I have worked together

757
00:39:26,375 --> 00:39:27,458
quite a lot recently.

758
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:29,124
- Oh, here's Inspector Drake
coming now.

759
00:39:29,417 --> 00:39:31,208
Shh! Shh!
Good evening, sir.

760
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,374
My lady will be here presently.

761
00:39:33,667 --> 00:39:35,333
- My dear Inspector.

762
00:39:35,625 --> 00:39:37,166
- Forgive me, Lady Jane,

763
00:39:37,459 --> 00:39:39,833
but I don't think
you should be wearing that.

764
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,249
- The necklace?

765
00:39:44,542 --> 00:39:45,916
Whyever not?

766
00:39:46,209 --> 00:39:50,083
- Because the Phantom has sworn
he'll have it.

767
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:55,749
And the Phantom
has never once failed.

768
00:39:56,042 --> 00:39:57,458
- Poirot.

769
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:00,291
Why did you want
to see the play again?

770
00:40:00,584 --> 00:40:03,874
- Tomorrow the play travels
to New York, mon ami.

771
00:40:04,167 --> 00:40:05,208
- Yes?

772
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,249
- Miss Lemon has yet
to see a performance.

773
00:40:07,542 --> 00:40:08,499
- Shh!

774
00:40:08,792 --> 00:40:10,583
- I mean to have him.

775
00:40:21,292 --> 00:40:23,624
- Good night, sir.

776
00:40:38,667 --> 00:40:41,083
- What are we doing here,
Poirot?

777
00:40:41,375 --> 00:40:43,624
The play is finished.

778
00:40:43,917 --> 00:40:47,458
- The play, it has finished,
yes, Hastings.

779
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:50,749
But there is still
one more act.

780
00:40:51,042 --> 00:40:51,833
- I don't understand.

781
00:40:52,084 --> 00:40:53,666
- Ah, mon cher Hastings,

782
00:40:53,959 --> 00:40:55,791
the pearls so celebrated
of the czar,

783
00:40:56,084 --> 00:40:58,291
where do you think a market
could be found for them?

784
00:40:58,584 --> 00:41:00,208
- Well, I don't know.

785
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,958
Somewhere on the Continent,
I suppose.

786
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:03,624
- No, no, no, Hastings.

787
00:41:03,917 --> 00:41:06,333
And that is what Miss Lemon
discovered for me in London.

788
00:41:06,625 --> 00:41:08,083
- They're just too well known
over here.

789
00:41:08,375 --> 00:41:09,333
No one would touch them.

790
00:41:09,625 --> 00:41:11,208
- In America, then?

791
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,749
- Exactement.

792
00:41:13,042 --> 00:41:14,708
And with everyone searching
for them,

793
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,416
what would be the best way
to smuggle them abroad?

794
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,958
- Well, of course,
in among the scenery and props

795
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:29,041
for the play.

796
00:41:29,334 --> 00:41:30,333
- Oui.

797
00:41:30,625 --> 00:41:32,249
- You mean they're here
somewhere?

798
00:41:32,542 --> 00:41:33,374
- Oui.

799
00:41:33,667 --> 00:41:34,458
- Well, where?

800
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:36,499
And who put them here?

801
00:41:36,792 --> 00:41:38,416
- This case,
it has been most curious,

802
00:41:38,709 --> 00:41:40,083
n'est-ce pas, Chief Inspector?

803
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:43,791
From the start,
there were only two people

804
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:45,666
who could possibly have stolen
those pearls

805
00:41:45,959 --> 00:41:47,208
of Monsieur Opalsen:

806
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:50,124
Mademoiselle Celestine

807
00:41:50,417 --> 00:41:54,083
or Mademoiselle Grace Wilson,
the hotel maid.

808
00:41:54,375 --> 00:41:55,541
- Well, it must have been
Celestine.

809
00:41:55,834 --> 00:41:56,666
She had the key.

810
00:41:56,959 --> 00:41:58,624
It was sewn into her petticoat.

811
00:41:58,917 --> 00:42:00,958
- It has always puzzled me,
that, Hastings.

812
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:02,374
Why keep the key?

813
00:42:02,667 --> 00:42:04,624
It was so needless, so clumsy.

814
00:42:04,917 --> 00:42:06,666
- Are you saying it was planted?

815
00:42:06,959 --> 00:42:08,083
- Yes, of course.

816
00:42:08,375 --> 00:42:11,166
- Well, if it wasn't Celestine,
it must have been Grace.

817
00:42:11,459 --> 00:42:13,624
But we know that she didn't
have time to take the pearls.

818
00:42:13,917 --> 00:42:14,749
You said so yourself.

819
00:42:15,042 --> 00:42:16,583
- It is a riddle, is it not,
Hastings?

820
00:42:16,875 --> 00:42:18,499
- So which of them was it?

821
00:42:25,959 --> 00:42:29,041
- Let us imagine.

822
00:42:29,334 --> 00:42:32,958
Mademoiselle Grace Wilson is
in the room of Monsieur Opalsen.

823
00:42:34,125 --> 00:42:35,874
She is there
only to be friendly.

824
00:42:36,167 --> 00:42:37,124
- I can get you some,
if you like.

825
00:42:37,417 --> 00:42:38,291
- No, it's all right.

826
00:42:38,584 --> 00:42:40,041
- The moment
that Mademoiselle Celestine

827
00:42:40,334 --> 00:42:41,749
leaves the room
to retrieve the scissors,

828
00:42:42,042 --> 00:42:44,374
as quick as a flash, she acts.

829
00:42:53,542 --> 00:42:55,833
She was able to execute
the theft of the pearls

830
00:42:56,125 --> 00:42:57,624
in an instant,

831
00:42:57,917 --> 00:43:00,583
because she did not need
to unlock the box herself.

832
00:43:00,875 --> 00:43:03,666
She had in the adjoining room
an accomplice

833
00:43:03,959 --> 00:43:05,458
with a duplicate key,

834
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:10,958
and it was he who removed
the pouch and the pearls.

835
00:43:13,125 --> 00:43:15,999
- Mr. Worthing.

836
00:43:16,292 --> 00:43:18,999
- Exactement, Hastings.

837
00:43:19,292 --> 00:43:21,041
And when Mademoiselle Celestine
leaves the room

838
00:43:21,334 --> 00:43:23,833
for the second time,
this time for some thread,

839
00:43:24,125 --> 00:43:27,958
the box, it is returned
in exactly the same manner.

840
00:43:31,459 --> 00:43:35,749
Only now, the necklace,
it has gone.

841
00:43:36,042 --> 00:43:38,958
- And I suppose it was
this mysterious Mr. Worthing

842
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:42,291
who hid the key
in Celestine's petticoat.

843
00:43:42,584 --> 00:43:45,416
- He or his accomplice,
Chief Inspector, yes.

844
00:43:45,709 --> 00:43:48,749
But it was definitely
Monsieur Worthing

845
00:43:49,042 --> 00:43:50,541
who placed into the pocket
of Monsieur Hall

846
00:43:50,834 --> 00:43:54,124
the pouch which was empty.

847
00:43:54,417 --> 00:43:55,208
- Poirot!

848
00:43:55,459 --> 00:43:56,249
That's right.

849
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:57,624
I saw him at the race course.

850
00:43:57,917 --> 00:44:00,291
There's Mr. Worthing.
I could have sworn it.

851
00:44:00,584 --> 00:44:01,999
But who is he?

852
00:44:02,292 --> 00:44:04,708
Who is this Mr. Worthing?

853
00:44:13,125 --> 00:44:14,583
Mr. Poirot.

854
00:44:14,875 --> 00:44:16,666
- Shh.

855
00:44:19,584 --> 00:44:22,749
- Shh.
Wait there.

856
00:44:48,625 --> 00:44:51,416
- It is a pleasure
to meet you at last,

857
00:44:51,709 --> 00:44:53,249
Mr. Worthing.

858
00:45:00,584 --> 00:45:02,708
- Saunders.

859
00:45:05,417 --> 00:45:07,416
- Let go!

860
00:45:07,709 --> 00:45:09,416
Get off me!
I done nothing wrong!

861
00:45:09,709 --> 00:45:11,541
Let go of me!

862
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:14,124
Oh, God.

863
00:45:24,709 --> 00:45:26,333
You bloody fool.

864
00:45:26,625 --> 00:45:28,166
I told you
we shouldn't ought to have come.

865
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:31,374
- But I think it is too late
for that, Madame Saunders.

866
00:45:31,667 --> 00:45:33,874
- Madame--what, you mean
they're married?

867
00:45:34,167 --> 00:45:35,916
- Yes, of course,
Chief Inspector.

868
00:45:36,209 --> 00:45:38,166
It was that that Miss Lemon
discovered for me

869
00:45:38,459 --> 00:45:39,624
at the Dog and the Duck
in Holborn.

870
00:45:39,917 --> 00:45:41,166
- Grace Saunders.

871
00:45:41,459 --> 00:45:43,666
The landlord
remembered her well.

872
00:45:43,959 --> 00:45:46,291
- But why the disguise?

873
00:45:46,584 --> 00:45:48,833
- Ah, Hastings.

874
00:45:49,125 --> 00:45:51,458
How else could Monsieur Saunders
reserve for himself

875
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:53,958
a room next door
to Monsieur Opalsen?

876
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:58,083
He had to assume a new identity.

877
00:45:58,375 --> 00:46:00,916
- How could you possibly know?

878
00:46:01,209 --> 00:46:04,958
- As ever, Monsieur, it was
the little details,

879
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:06,874
the matters of no consequence

880
00:46:07,167 --> 00:46:09,208
that caught the attention
of Poirot.

881
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:12,958
You will recall, Hastings,
on the night of the theft,

882
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:14,458
that I remarked
on some white powder

883
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:16,583
on the sleeve
of Monsieur Saunders.

884
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:18,291
Pardon.
You will forgive me?

885
00:46:20,292 --> 00:46:22,124
- I thought
it was talcum powder.

886
00:46:22,417 --> 00:46:24,583
- Thank you very much, sir.
- Not at all.

887
00:46:24,875 --> 00:46:26,374
No, Hastings,
it was not the talcum powder.

888
00:46:26,667 --> 00:46:29,249
It was the French chalk,
which cabinetmaker use

889
00:46:29,542 --> 00:46:31,708
to let the drawers made of wood
run more smoothly

890
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,541
and with which Monsieur Worthing
prepared beforehand

891
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:37,416
the drawer
containing the pearls.

892
00:46:39,542 --> 00:46:41,999
But I was suspicious
of Mr. Worthing

893
00:46:42,292 --> 00:46:43,416
long before this.

894
00:46:43,709 --> 00:46:45,124
- Your key, Mr. Worthing.

895
00:46:45,417 --> 00:46:46,374
- When Hastings and myself,

896
00:46:46,667 --> 00:46:48,499
we first came
to the Grand Metropolitan Hotel,

897
00:46:48,792 --> 00:46:50,499
there was a man at the desk.

898
00:46:50,792 --> 00:46:54,124
He was elderly.
He must walk with a stick.

899
00:46:54,417 --> 00:46:55,624
- Thank you.

900
00:46:55,917 --> 00:46:58,916
- But when he goes to his room,
which is on the first floor,

901
00:46:59,209 --> 00:47:02,291
he proceeds not to the lift
that is waiting, no,

902
00:47:02,584 --> 00:47:05,166
but to the staircase.

903
00:47:11,417 --> 00:47:13,541
It was a performance, Monsieur,

904
00:47:13,834 --> 00:47:17,999
but a performance that,
to Poirot, did not ring true.

905
00:47:20,459 --> 00:47:21,874
- Damn you.

906
00:47:22,167 --> 00:47:23,166
- That's enough of that.

907
00:47:23,459 --> 00:47:24,833
Take him away.

908
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:35,166
- One thing, Poirot.

909
00:47:35,459 --> 00:47:37,083
I know you were waiting
for them,

910
00:47:37,375 --> 00:47:38,624
but why did you think
they'd come here?

911
00:47:38,917 --> 00:47:41,249
- They came here, Hastings,
to retrieve the necklace.

912
00:47:41,542 --> 00:47:43,791
- I see.

913
00:47:45,959 --> 00:47:47,666
Where is the necklace?

914
00:47:47,959 --> 00:47:49,749
- The necklace, Hastings?

915
00:47:50,042 --> 00:47:53,374
It is, I think...

916
00:48:15,459 --> 00:48:17,583
Voila.

917
00:48:22,917 --> 00:48:24,916
- Damn Poirot!

918
00:48:25,209 --> 00:48:28,083
You mean that bloody little man
set me up?

919
00:48:28,375 --> 00:48:29,874
- It's your own fault.

920
00:48:30,167 --> 00:48:31,458
You tried to use him.

921
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:33,458
- But, Margaret,
what about the pearls?

922
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:35,624
- Don't worry.

923
00:48:35,917 --> 00:48:40,208
That "bloody little man"
got them back.

924
00:48:49,125 --> 00:48:52,333
- So you made up the story
about the fake pearls

925
00:48:52,625 --> 00:48:53,874
to smoke out the thieves.

926
00:48:54,167 --> 00:48:55,124
- Hmm.

927
00:48:55,417 --> 00:48:57,374
So now you learn the plot
of your next play,

928
00:48:57,667 --> 00:48:59,083
Monsieur Hall.

929
00:48:59,375 --> 00:49:01,708
Yes, I told to them
that the necklace, it was false,

930
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,499
because I knew that they would
then have to examine it.

931
00:49:04,792 --> 00:49:05,916
- We're all packed, Mr. Poirot.

932
00:49:06,209 --> 00:49:07,249
- Thank you, Miss Lemon.

933
00:49:07,542 --> 00:49:09,041
- The reward, Mr. Poirot.

934
00:49:09,334 --> 00:49:10,124
It should be yours.

935
00:49:10,375 --> 00:49:11,833
Why have you given it to me?

936
00:49:12,125 --> 00:49:13,208
- Because, Mademoiselle,

937
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:16,499
it was you who told to me
the title of the play

938
00:49:16,792 --> 00:49:19,166
The Importance
of Being Earnest.

939
00:49:19,459 --> 00:49:21,541
And there is in that play
a character

940
00:49:21,834 --> 00:49:24,124
that is very well known
who is called...

941
00:49:24,417 --> 00:49:25,208
- Jack Worthing.

942
00:49:25,459 --> 00:49:26,291
- C'est ca.

943
00:49:26,584 --> 00:49:28,749
And it was then that I saw
the light.

944
00:49:29,042 --> 00:49:33,374
So the reward, I think,
must be for you.

945
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:39,708
Miss Lemon?
Hastings?

946
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:52,916
- So much for your holiday,
Mr. Poirot.

947
00:49:53,209 --> 00:49:55,041
- But, Miss Lemon,
I feel completely refreshed.

948
00:49:55,334 --> 00:49:57,416
- Even so, this wasn't
what the doctor ordered.

949
00:49:57,709 --> 00:50:01,416
- Daily Echo!
Daily Echo!

950
00:50:05,292 --> 00:50:06,874
- You are Lucky Len
of the Daily Echo,

951
00:50:07,167 --> 00:50:09,666
and I claim my ten guineas.

952
00:50:09,959 --> 00:50:12,458
- You're right.
I was Lucky Len.

953
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:14,708
But I'm sorry;
I got fired this morning.

954
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,083
- Fired?
Why?

955
00:50:17,375 --> 00:50:19,041
- Too many people
were recognizing me.

956
00:50:19,334 --> 00:50:21,958
The paper decided
it must be my face.

957
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:24,291
It's too common.

958
00:50:24,584 --> 00:50:25,374
- Common?

959
00:50:25,625 --> 00:50:26,499
- That's what they said.

960
00:50:26,792 --> 00:50:28,458
Bit of a cheek, if you ask me.

961
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:29,583
But there you are.

962
00:50:29,875 --> 00:50:31,083
- They are wrong, mon ami.

963
00:50:31,375 --> 00:50:33,624
You have a face
that is most distinguished.

964
00:50:33,917 --> 00:50:37,624
You have no need
to work for this newspaper.

965
00:50:37,917 --> 00:50:39,999
You have a face of a great man.

966
00:50:40,292 --> 00:50:41,291
- You think so?

967
00:50:41,584 --> 00:50:42,624
- Oh, yes.

968
00:50:42,917 --> 00:50:45,749
I know it.
