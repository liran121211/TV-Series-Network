1
00:02:08,542 --> 00:02:10,041
- What do you think, Poirot?

2
00:02:10,334 --> 00:02:12,749
- I think it looks very untidy,
Hastings.

3
00:02:13,042 --> 00:02:14,041
- But it's not meant to be tidy.

4
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,874
Tidy's got nothing
to do with it.

5
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,458
It's compact, though--
You have to admit that.

6
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,291
They're using twin overhead
camshafts, you see,

7
00:02:22,584 --> 00:02:24,166
with desmodromic valve gear

8
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:26,416
and a hemispherical
combustion chamber.

9
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:28,291
- I see.

10
00:02:28,584 --> 00:02:30,416
- Ah!
Mr. Vizzini.

11
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:31,916
- How are you today?

12
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:33,833
- Oh, pretty well, you know.

13
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:35,916
This is Monsieur Hercule Poirot.

14
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:37,624
- Hello.

15
00:02:37,917 --> 00:02:39,749
Great detective.

16
00:02:40,042 --> 00:02:43,583
I must watch my step, eh?

17
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:45,291
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Signor Poirot.

18
00:02:45,584 --> 00:02:47,916
- Delighted, Monsieur Vizzini.

19
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:51,291
- Well, Signor Hastings,
you place the order today?

20
00:02:51,584 --> 00:02:53,458
- Well...
- Oh, Signor Hastings.

21
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,874
- It's a big decision.

22
00:02:55,167 --> 00:02:57,291
- Seven weeks, Signor Hastings.

23
00:02:57,584 --> 00:02:58,916
The factory of Eliso-Freccia
in Milan,

24
00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:00,208
they stand wait.

25
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,916
Will the order
of Capitano Hastings come today?

26
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:05,458
- Well, I've been thinking--

27
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,624
- Mr. Vizzini, excuse me.

28
00:03:07,917 --> 00:03:10,666
You'll be late for your lunch
with Mr. Andreotti.

29
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,749
- I thank you, Margherita.

30
00:03:13,042 --> 00:03:16,333
Gentlemen, I will leave you
in the capable hands

31
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,791
of Signorina Fabbri.

32
00:03:19,084 --> 00:03:22,083
Mi scusi.

33
00:03:24,167 --> 00:03:26,124
- I was just going to say
to Mr. Vizzini,

34
00:03:26,417 --> 00:03:28,499
with this new trailing link
front suspension,

35
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,916
I wonder if you don't need
some sort of stabilizer.

36
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:33,541
You see--
- No.

37
00:03:33,834 --> 00:03:35,666
- No.
No?

38
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:38,166
- The radius roll trailing
from the cross member

39
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:41,624
locates each hub fore and aft.

40
00:03:41,917 --> 00:03:43,416
- Yes, well, I appreciate that--

41
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:47,416
- And each unit's damped by
the inclined telescopic struts.

42
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:49,583
- Right.

43
00:03:50,584 --> 00:03:53,374
Yes.

44
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:55,874
- You will have to make up
your mind, Hastings.

45
00:03:56,167 --> 00:03:57,291
- Yeah, well, I'm going to.

46
00:03:57,584 --> 00:03:59,416
Tomorrow's the last day.

47
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:01,458
I've got it marked in my diary.

48
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,833
It says, "Decide about car."

49
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:10,958
I say, Poirot...

50
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,333
- What is it, Hastings?

51
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:13,833
- Miss Lemon's not here.

52
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:15,999
- No?

53
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,249
- It's 2:20.

54
00:04:18,584 --> 00:04:19,666
- Here she is now.

55
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,791
- Hastings, please.
I'm trying to read this letter.

56
00:04:22,084 --> 00:04:24,708
- But--
- Mr. Poirot, I'm so sorry.

57
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,999
- Not at all, Miss Lemon.

58
00:04:26,292 --> 00:04:28,166
It is of no importance.

59
00:04:28,459 --> 00:04:29,749
Your friend is well?

60
00:04:30,042 --> 00:04:34,458
- Well, he, uh...
he's, um...

61
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,083
uh, we went
to the Lyons Corner House.

62
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:39,791
- How very nice.

63
00:04:40,084 --> 00:04:41,249
Thank you, Miss Lemon.

64
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,124
- Thank you, Mr. Poirot.

65
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,083
- Oh, Miss Lemon.

66
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:48,458
Why do you not invite
your friend, Monsieur--

67
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,374
How does he call himself?

68
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:52,583
- Mr. Graves?

69
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,333
- Yes, indeed.

70
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,458
Why do you not invite
your friend, Monsieur Graves,

71
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,708
to tea one day?

72
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,208
- Oh, yes.

73
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,874
Thank you, Mr. Poirot.

74
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,041
As a matter of fact,

75
00:05:05,334 --> 00:05:06,458
Mr. Graves was most interested

76
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,333
when I told him
I worked for you.

77
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,749
He's very interested
in that sort of thing.

78
00:05:11,042 --> 00:05:12,541
- Excellent.

79
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:15,208
Thank you, Miss Lemon.

80
00:05:20,334 --> 00:05:22,583
- What on Earth's going on,
Poirot?

81
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:23,999
- Hastings.

82
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:30,416
Miss Lemon has an admirer.

83
00:05:31,167 --> 00:05:33,249
- No!

84
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,874
- If you sign here and here.

85
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:44,833
- Oh, how long is delivery?

86
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,083
- There are three arriving
at the docks tomorrow.

87
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:48,749
I'll telephone and...

88
00:05:53,292 --> 00:05:56,041
Excuse me a moment.

89
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:35,583
- All done.

90
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,208
- Good.

91
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,749
- Another customer?

92
00:06:39,042 --> 00:06:39,874
- What?

93
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:41,124
Oh, no.
That was my uncle.

94
00:06:41,417 --> 00:06:42,583
Just a family matter.

95
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:45,124
- Oh, right.

96
00:06:45,417 --> 00:06:47,499
You'll want the check now, then?

97
00:07:02,709 --> 00:07:04,041
- Ah, Hastings.

98
00:07:04,334 --> 00:07:05,124
You bought your car?

99
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:06,958
- Bought and paid for.

100
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,791
- Captain Hastings.

101
00:07:10,084 --> 00:07:11,541
This is Mr. Graves.

102
00:07:11,834 --> 00:07:13,458
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

103
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,416
I was just saying
to Monsieur Poirot

104
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:17,291
how much I envy you all

105
00:07:17,584 --> 00:07:18,999
the exciting business you're in.

106
00:07:19,292 --> 00:07:20,333
- Well, you know.

107
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:21,416
Please.

108
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:23,999
- Thank you.

109
00:07:24,292 --> 00:07:27,333
I stayed on in the Navy
after the war.

110
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:30,249
I should have come out in 1919.

111
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:33,749
- Mr. Graves still has a boat.

112
00:07:34,042 --> 00:07:35,374
- Not from the Navy, I hope.

113
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:36,458
- Oh, no.

114
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:39,999
- Show them the picture, Edwin.

115
00:07:40,292 --> 00:07:42,999
- All right.

116
00:07:43,292 --> 00:07:44,333
There.

117
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:46,166
- Oh.

118
00:07:46,417 --> 00:07:48,208
Very trim.

119
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,583
Fantasia Felice.

120
00:07:54,584 --> 00:07:57,833
- As a matter of fact,
Monsieur Poirot--

121
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,208
No.

122
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,916
- Yes, Monsieur Graves?

123
00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:02,416
- Eh, no.
it's...

124
00:08:02,709 --> 00:08:04,208
Oh, well, why not?

125
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,499
It's, uh, just that I was
going to say I was very near

126
00:08:07,792 --> 00:08:10,291
to consulting
a private detective myself

127
00:08:10,584 --> 00:08:11,499
earlier today.

128
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:12,583
- Indeed?

129
00:08:12,834 --> 00:08:14,041
- What happened, Edwin?

130
00:08:14,334 --> 00:08:17,041
- Well, I've been with
my employer for 11 years.

131
00:08:17,334 --> 00:08:20,166
He's a foreign gentleman
living in London.

132
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:22,833
- And in what capacity does he
employ you, Monsieur Graves?

133
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:25,499
- Mr. Graves is
a private secretary.

134
00:08:25,792 --> 00:08:30,999
- Some very confidential papers
were recently stolen.

135
00:08:31,292 --> 00:08:34,249
My employer has been asked
to try to buy these papers back

136
00:08:34,542 --> 00:08:35,749
for his government.

137
00:08:36,042 --> 00:08:38,458
He used to be a diplomat.

138
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,916
Oh, dear.

139
00:08:40,209 --> 00:08:41,166
I don't quite know how to...

140
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:43,041
- We are talking
about blackmail here,

141
00:08:43,334 --> 00:08:44,833
are we not, Monsieur Graves?

142
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:50,166
- Well, these papers do contain
information which would,

143
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:51,583
well, do no good
for the reputation

144
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:54,374
of the leader
of that particular country.

145
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:56,333
And the truth is,

146
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,416
I don't trust
the other party involved.

147
00:08:58,709 --> 00:08:59,958
- And with a blackmailer,
of course,

148
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,583
one has to be sure
that the evidence,

149
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,166
it is destroyed root and boot.

150
00:09:04,459 --> 00:09:05,458
- Branch.

151
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:06,791
- Thank you, Hastings.

152
00:09:07,084 --> 00:09:09,874
But we must have more details,
Monsieur Graves.

153
00:09:10,167 --> 00:09:11,999
- No.

154
00:09:12,292 --> 00:09:14,291
That's what's so dash
difficult.

155
00:09:14,584 --> 00:09:15,999
I mean, one hint of scandal

156
00:09:16,292 --> 00:09:18,666
would put the kibosh
on the whole thing.

157
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,208
Look, I shouldn't have
brought this up.

158
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,874
I'm sorry.

159
00:09:23,167 --> 00:09:25,833
Could I have another cup of tea,
Felicity?

160
00:09:29,292 --> 00:09:31,624
- It's very daring of you,
I must say, Hastings,

161
00:09:31,917 --> 00:09:34,291
going in for one
of these foreign cars.

162
00:09:34,584 --> 00:09:36,999
It's too complicated
for the likes of me.

163
00:09:37,292 --> 00:09:40,291
I'll stick to my little Riley,
I think.

164
00:09:40,584 --> 00:09:41,666
- We mustn't talk about cars.

165
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:44,124
We'll bore Poirot
to distraction.

166
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:48,583
- Oh, half the fun in buying
cars is talking about it.

167
00:09:50,542 --> 00:09:52,583
Would you answer that,
Miss Rider?

168
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:53,666
- Certainly, Doctor.

169
00:09:53,917 --> 00:09:55,291
- If it's an emergency,

170
00:09:55,584 --> 00:09:57,374
tell them to take two aspirin
and keep warm.

171
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:05,833
- I shall never buy a motor car.

172
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:10,416
But if I did, I should ask
only three questions.

173
00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:13,208
One: does it have
the correct number of wheels?

174
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,583
Two: are those wheels
firmly attached

175
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:16,958
to the corners of the machine?

176
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,083
- Doctor!

177
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,166
It was for you.

178
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:21,999
It was a terrible voice.

179
00:10:22,292 --> 00:10:24,583
- What's wrong, Miss Rider?

180
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:28,333
- I answered the telephone,
and this voice said, "Help."

181
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:32,791
It said, "Doctor, help.
They've killed me."

182
00:10:34,584 --> 00:10:36,583
And then it sort
of trailed away.

183
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,541
"Who's speaking?"
I said,

184
00:10:38,834 --> 00:10:40,624
and there was this--

185
00:10:40,917 --> 00:10:43,208
well, it was just a whisper.

186
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,708
"Foscatine.
Addisland Court."

187
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,291
- Count Foscatini.

188
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,124
Hello?

189
00:10:56,417 --> 00:10:58,416
Hello.

190
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:01,583
- This is getting serious.

191
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,624
- What's going on?

192
00:11:03,917 --> 00:11:05,833
- I am Count Foscatini's doctor.

193
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,749
I received a telephone call
from the count

194
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,666
saying he'd been attacked
and was dying.

195
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:12,333
- Well, do you have a key?

196
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,041
- Count Foscatini?

197
00:11:26,334 --> 00:11:27,124
- Shh.

198
00:11:28,417 --> 00:11:30,499
What's that?

199
00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:03,666
- Good god.

200
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,624
I'd better telephone
the police.

201
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:19,416
- He's dead.

202
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,083
- Look at that.

203
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,041
Must have been the weapon.

204
00:12:25,334 --> 00:12:26,416
- Possibly.

205
00:12:26,709 --> 00:12:28,791
Hastings, make a search
of the apartment.

206
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,416
- Almost instantaneous,
I would have said.

207
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:36,874
A wonder he even managed
to telephone.

208
00:13:03,209 --> 00:13:05,291
- Nothing.

209
00:13:08,084 --> 00:13:09,124
What do you see, Poirot?

210
00:13:09,417 --> 00:13:12,124
- Exactly what you see,
mon ami.

211
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,291
- Two coffee cups,

212
00:13:14,584 --> 00:13:16,333
both with the remains
of black coffee.

213
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,708
Dish of fruit.

214
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,666
Nobody's used
their dessert plates there.

215
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,916
Two glasses.

216
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:25,416
Port.

217
00:13:25,709 --> 00:13:27,749
Doesn't seem to shed
much light on anything.

218
00:13:31,334 --> 00:13:32,958
- The police are on their way.

219
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,499
- Excuse me, Doctor.

220
00:13:34,792 --> 00:13:37,583
S'il vous plait, monsieur.

221
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,749
This meal, was it provided
by your kitchens here?

222
00:13:42,709 --> 00:13:46,541
- Flat ten ordered for two
from the a la carte menu

223
00:13:46,834 --> 00:13:48,541
sent down by lift.

224
00:13:48,834 --> 00:13:51,749
Soup Julienne,
filets de sole Normande,

225
00:13:52,042 --> 00:13:53,499
tournedos of beef,

226
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:56,124
and a rice soufflé.

227
00:13:56,417 --> 00:13:58,333
There was naught wrong
with my food, you know.

228
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,958
This kitchen's a showplace
for hygiene.

229
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,583
- Yes,
yes indeed.

230
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:06,124
One can perceive.

231
00:14:06,417 --> 00:14:09,208
It would be impossible
therefore, I imagine,

232
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,291
to examine the dishes
from the apartment?

233
00:14:12,584 --> 00:14:16,249
- Washed up, dried up,
stacked up long since.

234
00:14:16,542 --> 00:14:19,416
Thinking of fingerprints,
were you?

235
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:22,708
- Not exactly, monsieur.

236
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,041
I am more interested in
the appetite of Count Foscatini.

237
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:29,458
Did he partake of every dish?

238
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,208
- We don't label the plates,
you know,

239
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,749
with everybody's names.

240
00:14:34,042 --> 00:14:36,541
But all the plates
from ten were dirty

241
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,666
and the serving dishes empty.

242
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,041
So he must have eaten something.

243
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:48,833
- Let him finish
the photographs

244
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:52,374
before you check for prints,
Beddoes.

245
00:14:52,667 --> 00:14:56,708
Thank you for your help,
Dr. Hawker.

246
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,499
Oh,
well, well, well.

247
00:14:59,792 --> 00:15:01,874
I managed to get here
before you this time, Poirot.

248
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:03,624
- No, no, not at all,
Chief Inspector.

249
00:15:03,917 --> 00:15:06,083
I've just been upstairs
interviewing the chef.

250
00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:09,624
- Cor blimey.

251
00:15:09,917 --> 00:15:11,833
Haven't you finished
in here yet?

252
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:15,291
- All right, sir.
Working as fast as we can.

253
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,083
- A sad occasion, n'est-ce pas?

254
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,958
- A violent death
is so wasteful.

255
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,999
God knows death comes
soon enough to us all anyway.

256
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,333
- Monsieur Poirot.

257
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,749
What are you doing here?

258
00:15:36,042 --> 00:15:37,083
What's happened?

259
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,083
- Monsieur Graves.

260
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:40,916
Where is my master?

261
00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:42,791
- Who're you?

262
00:15:43,084 --> 00:15:43,874
- My name's Graves.

263
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:47,166
I'm Count Foscatini's

264
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:49,874
valet.

265
00:15:50,167 --> 00:15:51,624
What's happened?

266
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:53,583
- Your master's been murdered,

267
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,958
that's what's happened.

268
00:16:06,459 --> 00:16:10,833
- Yesterday another Italian
gentleman came to see the count.

269
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,041
Sir.

270
00:16:12,334 --> 00:16:13,583
- I'm here to see
Count Foscatini.

271
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:15,291
- What name shall I say, sir?

272
00:16:15,584 --> 00:16:16,458
- Mario Asciano.

273
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,166
He's expecting me.

274
00:16:18,459 --> 00:16:19,458
- Come in, sir.

275
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,916
I showed him in,

276
00:16:21,209 --> 00:16:23,791
although the count
hadn't told me he was coming.

277
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:26,708
This way, sir.

278
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,958
Signor Asciano to see you, sir.

279
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,791
- Avanti.

280
00:16:31,084 --> 00:16:34,708
Entrare, Signor Asciano.

281
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,833
Come stai?

282
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:36,916
- Sto bene.
Grazie.

283
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:38,624
- Graves.
- Sir?

284
00:16:38,917 --> 00:16:41,249
- Go to Bates
and collect that trilby

285
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,124
they've been reblocking for me,
will you?

286
00:16:43,417 --> 00:16:46,041
- Certainly, sir.

287
00:16:46,334 --> 00:16:47,416
- So you went out?

288
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:49,708
You don't know what went on
between them.

289
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,291
- Well, sir,
I was very surprised

290
00:16:52,584 --> 00:16:54,749
the count asked me to leave
when we had a visitor,

291
00:16:55,042 --> 00:17:01,333
so I did sort of linger
for a bit.

292
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:02,416
- And what did you hear?

293
00:17:02,709 --> 00:17:04,249
- Hello.

294
00:17:04,542 --> 00:17:07,874
I'd like to order lunch for two.
Flat 10.

295
00:17:08,167 --> 00:17:11,458
- It wasn't very clear, sir,
but I know they had lunch

296
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,833
because I heard
the count order it.

297
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:16,833
- Hm.
I see.

298
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:18,499
Well, go on.

299
00:17:18,792 --> 00:17:21,833
- Signor Asciano seemed
to have something in his case

300
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,916
which he was offering the Count.

301
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,499
I'm not really sure,

302
00:17:25,792 --> 00:17:28,541
but I think he was
demanding money for it.

303
00:17:28,834 --> 00:17:29,666
- Ah.

304
00:17:29,959 --> 00:17:31,208
Well, now we're getting
somewhere.

305
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,291
Blackmail, eh?

306
00:17:32,542 --> 00:17:33,333
- Oh, no, sir.

307
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,208
The count was
a most respectable man.

308
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,916
If blackmail was involved,

309
00:17:37,209 --> 00:17:39,583
I'm sure he was acting
for someone else,

310
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:43,166
but I don't know who.

311
00:17:43,459 --> 00:17:44,708
- All right.

312
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,499
What happened then?

313
00:17:46,792 --> 00:17:49,291
- Well, nothing until
this afternoon

314
00:17:49,584 --> 00:17:51,583
when the count told me
the same gentleman

315
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,583
would be coming to dinner
this evening.

316
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:56,916
- And?
- And he came.

317
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:58,624
I served them dinner,

318
00:17:58,917 --> 00:18:00,791
and after I brought in the port,

319
00:18:01,084 --> 00:18:03,416
the count said I could take
the rest of the evening off.

320
00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:05,833
They went into the study,

321
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:07,958
and I went out.

322
00:18:08,834 --> 00:18:10,291
- What time was that?

323
00:18:12,084 --> 00:18:14,166
- Just before 9:00, sir.

324
00:18:23,167 --> 00:18:24,458
- Do you think Foscatini
was active

325
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,749
in the Italian government?

326
00:18:26,042 --> 00:18:27,999
- Very possibly, Hastings.

327
00:18:28,292 --> 00:18:29,624
- Well, then why didn't Graves
tell Japp?

328
00:18:29,917 --> 00:18:31,624
- Because obviously
he's respecting the wishes

329
00:18:31,917 --> 00:18:33,249
of the Count Foscatini
not to endanger

330
00:18:33,542 --> 00:18:35,541
the negotiations internationale.

331
00:18:35,834 --> 00:18:37,083
The question is, Hastings,

332
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,708
did Asciano take the money
but not hand over the papers?

333
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,791
And since neither the money
nor the papers are here,

334
00:18:42,084 --> 00:18:43,166
that would appear to be likely

335
00:18:43,459 --> 00:18:45,541
and a powerful motivation
for murder.

336
00:18:55,792 --> 00:18:57,083
- That was under the desk.

337
00:18:57,375 --> 00:19:01,999
Apparently the victim knocked
it over as he fell forward.

338
00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:03,291
- Yeah, that's convenient.

339
00:19:03,584 --> 00:19:05,624
Gives us the time
of the murder anyway.

340
00:19:05,917 --> 00:19:07,083
9:10.

341
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:08,458
- That was the time

342
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,874
at which Dr. Hawker received
the telephone call.

343
00:19:12,167 --> 00:19:13,208
- Good.

344
00:19:21,084 --> 00:19:22,791
- Wait a minute.

345
00:19:25,167 --> 00:19:26,624
I've seen him before.

346
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:29,291
At the garage
when I bought my car.

347
00:19:29,584 --> 00:19:31,666
It's Miss Fabbri's uncle.

348
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,916
Why on Earth did Graves
tell Miss Lemon

349
00:19:51,209 --> 00:19:53,583
he was a private secretary
when he's really only a valet?

350
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:56,708
- Hastings, have you never
exaggerated your own importance

351
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,541
in order to impress
a young lady?

352
00:19:58,834 --> 00:19:59,624
- Most certainly not.

353
00:19:59,917 --> 00:20:01,083
Never.

354
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:03,499
Oh, well, I once told a girl
I was a member at Wentworth

355
00:20:03,792 --> 00:20:06,749
when I wasn't,
but she didn't play golf anyway.

356
00:20:07,042 --> 00:20:09,208
She thought Wentworth
was a lunatic asylum.

357
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,749
- 'Scuse me, gents.

358
00:20:11,042 --> 00:20:12,499
There's no one there.

359
00:20:12,792 --> 00:20:15,666
They're all at the wedding
on the roof gardens.

360
00:20:15,959 --> 00:20:17,541
I'm the only one left.

361
00:20:17,834 --> 00:20:19,416
I'm not Italian.

362
00:21:07,792 --> 00:21:08,666
- Yes.

363
00:21:08,959 --> 00:21:10,666
We shall never find
her here, Hastings.

364
00:21:10,959 --> 00:21:12,124
- Well, we've got to tell her.

365
00:21:12,417 --> 00:21:14,541
We can’t just let her find out
from the newspapers.

366
00:21:15,834 --> 00:21:17,916
- Captain Hastings.

367
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,999
- Hello, Miss Fabbri.

368
00:21:24,292 --> 00:21:25,208
- Mademoiselle.

369
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,958
-I'm sorry to break in
like this.

370
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,333
We've got some bad news,
I'm afraid.

371
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,791
- Oh?
- It's your uncle.

372
00:21:32,084 --> 00:21:33,374
- My uncle?

373
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,916
- The one who came
to see you at the showroom,

374
00:21:36,209 --> 00:21:37,458
Count Foscatini.

375
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,916
- Ah, my uncle.

376
00:21:40,209 --> 00:21:41,666
- I'm sorry.

377
00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:45,249
I'm afraid he's dead.

378
00:21:45,542 --> 00:21:47,916
Murdered.

379
00:21:48,209 --> 00:21:50,666
- Oh, excuse me.

380
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:53,041
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.

381
00:21:56,667 --> 00:21:59,333
- She seems to be taking it
rather badly.

382
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:00,749
- Yes.

383
00:22:47,917 --> 00:22:48,791
- Go!

384
00:22:49,084 --> 00:22:50,791
Open up.
Police!

385
00:23:06,209 --> 00:23:08,916
- You looking for Asciano?

386
00:23:09,209 --> 00:23:12,958
- Yeah.

387
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:16,666
- He's not there.

388
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:18,833
Not been there since Monday.

389
00:23:26,792 --> 00:23:28,416
- Japp says Asciano's bolted.

390
00:23:28,709 --> 00:23:30,083
They've put a watch
on all the ports

391
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:32,041
in case he tries to get back
to Italy,

392
00:23:32,334 --> 00:23:34,416
but...

393
00:23:37,209 --> 00:23:40,333
- Il Primo Segretario
will see you now.

394
00:23:52,834 --> 00:23:54,666
- Good afternoon,
Monsieur Poirot,

395
00:23:54,959 --> 00:23:56,041
Captain Hastings.

396
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:58,416
Do sit down, please.

397
00:24:01,709 --> 00:24:05,124
After your telephone call,
Monsieur Poirot,

398
00:24:05,417 --> 00:24:07,958
I had some inquiries made.

399
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:12,333
We at the embassy have
no knowledge of Count Foscatini.

400
00:24:14,042 --> 00:24:16,041
- His man certainly seems
to think you do.

401
00:24:16,334 --> 00:24:17,958
- Yes, he thought
that he was working on behalf

402
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:21,208
of the Italian government in
some negotiations very delicate.

403
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,999
- No.

404
00:24:23,292 --> 00:24:26,083
- What about this Mario Asciano?

405
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:28,666
Have you had any dealings
with him?

406
00:24:28,959 --> 00:24:33,583
- Italian government
does not deal with Masnadieri.

407
00:24:34,709 --> 00:24:36,583
- So you do know who he is.

408
00:24:38,584 --> 00:24:40,541
- Our embassy throughout
the world

409
00:24:40,834 --> 00:24:46,583
tries to keep as full a record
as possible of known Masnadieri.

410
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:50,333
Asciano appears
on several of them.

411
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:53,874
- What was he saying

412
00:24:54,167 --> 00:24:55,874
about making a register
of some Italian thing?

413
00:24:56,167 --> 00:24:57,541
- The Masnada, Hastings,

414
00:24:57,834 --> 00:24:59,583
is a very secret, ancient
confederation of gangs

415
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:02,416
spread across the world
from Naples, where it started.

416
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:04,291
- Like this mafia whatnot
I read about?

417
00:25:04,584 --> 00:25:05,624
- No.

418
00:25:05,917 --> 00:25:07,999
It is older than the mafia.

419
00:25:17,459 --> 00:25:18,374
- So what's the connection

420
00:25:18,667 --> 00:25:20,666
between the Masnada
and Foscatini?

421
00:25:20,959 --> 00:25:22,208
- I do not know, mon ami.

422
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,208
Perhaps they came into
possession of these papers

423
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,499
which we are told so embarrassed
the Italian government,

424
00:25:26,792 --> 00:25:29,499
and Asciano was the man
deputed to sell them back,

425
00:25:29,792 --> 00:25:32,499
just as the government
deputed this so-called Foscatini

426
00:25:32,792 --> 00:25:34,208
to buy them.

427
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,999
- The embassy said
they'd never heard of him.

428
00:25:36,292 --> 00:25:38,374
- What else would they say?

429
00:25:54,625 --> 00:25:56,458
- I didn't think you'd have
anything to do with me

430
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,499
if you thought I was a servant.

431
00:25:58,792 --> 00:26:01,374
- Oh...
- Well, would you?

432
00:26:05,375 --> 00:26:07,208
- Probably not.

433
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,916
But that's my fault.

434
00:26:11,209 --> 00:26:12,916
- It doesn't matter
who's fault it is.

435
00:26:13,209 --> 00:26:15,541
- All right,
nobody's fault.

436
00:26:15,834 --> 00:26:18,833
The way we're all brought up
to think.

437
00:26:21,125 --> 00:26:24,249
- Thank you, Hastings.

438
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:26,916
- Monsieur Poirot.

439
00:26:27,209 --> 00:26:28,833
- Monsieur Graves.

440
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:30,333
- Any news?

441
00:26:30,625 --> 00:26:31,874
- Very little, I fear.

442
00:26:32,167 --> 00:26:33,999
Asciano is nowhere to be found.

443
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,833
- Oh.

444
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:39,916
Oh, well, I'd best be off,
Felicity.

445
00:26:40,209 --> 00:26:42,499
Good-bye, Monsieur Poirot.

446
00:26:42,792 --> 00:26:43,874
- Monsieur Graves.

447
00:26:47,084 --> 00:26:49,124
- I...

448
00:26:49,417 --> 00:26:53,624
I should never have left
the count alone last night.

449
00:26:53,917 --> 00:26:56,291
I mean, I told you, didn't I,
that I didn't trust Asciano.

450
00:26:56,584 --> 00:26:59,249
- But it is not your fault,
Monsieur Graves.

451
00:26:59,542 --> 00:27:01,624
- And I just ups and offs
to the music hall.

452
00:27:01,917 --> 00:27:03,499
- You weren't to know, Edwin.

453
00:27:03,792 --> 00:27:05,874
- You must dismiss it
from your mind.

454
00:27:08,375 --> 00:27:10,583
- Yes.

455
00:27:10,875 --> 00:27:12,874
Well.

456
00:27:13,167 --> 00:27:14,874
Good-bye, Captain Hastings.

457
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:17,249
- Good-bye, Mr. Graves.

458
00:27:29,417 --> 00:27:31,499
- I have discovered something
rather interesting,

459
00:27:31,792 --> 00:27:32,624
Mr. Poirot.

460
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:34,749
- What is that, Miss Lemon?

461
00:27:35,042 --> 00:27:37,624
- Who was Count Foscatini?

462
00:27:39,709 --> 00:27:40,541
- Comment?

463
00:27:40,834 --> 00:27:42,458
- Well, there isn't
any such person.

464
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,541
- What do you mean?

465
00:27:44,834 --> 00:27:48,416
- I looked up Count Foscatini
in your Almanach de Gotha,

466
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:50,166
and there's no such title
and never has been,

467
00:27:50,459 --> 00:27:53,833
as far as I could see.

468
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:56,791
I didn't like
to tell Mr. Graves.

469
00:27:57,084 --> 00:28:00,499
He's quite upset enough already.

470
00:28:05,792 --> 00:28:07,416
- You see, Hastings?

471
00:28:08,625 --> 00:28:09,874
In every case of murder,

472
00:28:10,167 --> 00:28:11,833
we spend so much time wondering
who is the killer

473
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:15,333
that we do not consider
the identity of the victim.

474
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:21,083
- There's a Mr. Darida
to see you, Mr. Poirot,

475
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:23,624
from the Italian embassy.

476
00:28:23,917 --> 00:28:25,749
- Show him in, Miss Lemon.

477
00:28:26,042 --> 00:28:28,124
- This way, Mr. Darida.

478
00:28:39,375 --> 00:28:41,874
- Il Primo Segretario told you

479
00:28:42,167 --> 00:28:46,041
that he does not deal
with the Masnada, I expect.

480
00:28:49,084 --> 00:28:52,791
Il Primo Segretario does
everything by the rulebook.

481
00:28:59,042 --> 00:29:02,041
Asciano came to the embassy
this morning,

482
00:29:02,334 --> 00:29:06,208
trying to sell some papers.

483
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,041
- What papers?
What was in them?

484
00:29:08,334 --> 00:29:11,833
- I don't know,
but I'd like to.

485
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:15,666
If Asciano gets them back
to Italy, we'll never know.

486
00:29:15,959 --> 00:29:17,458
- Is that where he has gone?

487
00:29:18,542 --> 00:29:21,666
- That is the only other place
he could sell them.

488
00:29:21,959 --> 00:29:24,041
- Has he left London already?

489
00:29:24,334 --> 00:29:25,458
- He left his house.

490
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:29,666
He said we could contact him
at Jenkins' Hotel

491
00:29:29,959 --> 00:29:32,041
in Bloomsbury.

492
00:29:59,334 --> 00:30:00,999
- Fairly sure he's in his room,
sir.

493
00:30:01,292 --> 00:30:02,541
- The men in position
around the back?

494
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:04,708
- Yes, sir.

495
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,541
- Open up!
Police!

496
00:30:39,834 --> 00:30:42,499
Come on!
Open up!

497
00:30:46,959 --> 00:30:49,041
Please.

498
00:30:57,375 --> 00:30:59,499
Come on, man,
put your shoulder into it.

499
00:30:59,792 --> 00:31:01,874
- Doing my best, sir.

500
00:31:03,917 --> 00:31:05,041
- One more!

501
00:31:07,334 --> 00:31:09,208
- Your name Asciano?
- Yes.

502
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,666
- I want to ask you
a few questions, Mr. Asciano.

503
00:31:11,959 --> 00:31:13,041
- About what?

504
00:31:13,334 --> 00:31:14,958
- Never mind the clever talk.

505
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:16,041
Where's the money?

506
00:31:16,292 --> 00:31:18,083
- What money?

507
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:19,499
- I see.

508
00:31:19,792 --> 00:31:22,958
Where were you between 8:00
and 9:00 yesterday evening?

509
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:24,708
- 'Tween 8:00 and 9:00?

510
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,791
Here.

511
00:31:26,042 --> 00:31:27,041
- Oh, yes?

512
00:31:27,334 --> 00:31:29,916
Well, we have reason
to doubt that, Mr. Asciano.

513
00:31:30,209 --> 00:31:32,249
We have reason to believe
that you were having dinner

514
00:31:32,542 --> 00:31:36,041
with a Count Foscatini
at his flat in Addisland Court.

515
00:31:36,334 --> 00:31:39,541
- I do not know
any Count Foscatini.

516
00:31:40,792 --> 00:31:42,499
- Ah.

517
00:31:42,792 --> 00:31:46,208
- And you have never heard
perhaps of Addisland Court?

518
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,624
- No, I've never heard
of Addisland Court.

519
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,083
- Well,
then it's very coincidental

520
00:31:53,375 --> 00:31:55,416
that here's the remains
of a piece of paper

521
00:31:55,709 --> 00:31:57,291
that's been burning
in your grate

522
00:31:57,584 --> 00:31:59,166
that has the words
"Addisland Court"

523
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,541
printed on it.

524
00:32:03,084 --> 00:32:05,666
- Come on!

525
00:32:16,459 --> 00:32:17,874
- Well, that's that.

526
00:32:18,167 --> 00:32:19,458
- On the contrary, mon ami.

527
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,708
It is, by no means, that.

528
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,458
- The case against him
seems pretty strong to me.

529
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:27,083
- Indeed.

530
00:32:27,375 --> 00:32:29,374
Asciano was blackmailing
the Italian government.

531
00:32:29,667 --> 00:32:30,708
- Yes.

532
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,624
- And Foscatini is employed
by the government

533
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:34,499
to pay money to retrieve
incriminating papers

534
00:32:34,792 --> 00:32:35,583
from Asciano.

535
00:32:35,875 --> 00:32:36,916
- Right.

536
00:32:37,209 --> 00:32:39,791
- So where is the motive
for Asciano to kill Foscatini?

537
00:32:40,084 --> 00:32:40,874
- Well...

538
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:41,916
- And where is the money?

539
00:32:42,167 --> 00:32:42,958
- Well...

540
00:32:43,209 --> 00:32:44,416
- And another thing
we must consider

541
00:32:44,709 --> 00:32:45,749
most carefully, Hastings,

542
00:32:46,042 --> 00:32:47,874
is the window in the dining room
of Count Foscatini.

543
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:49,874
- The window?
But it was fastened.

544
00:32:50,167 --> 00:32:51,499
Nobody could have gone
in or out that way.

545
00:32:51,792 --> 00:32:52,708
I noticed especially.

546
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,666
- Precisement.

547
00:32:58,667 --> 00:33:00,124
- Has Asciano confessed
to the murder yet,

548
00:33:00,417 --> 00:33:01,208
Chief Inspector?

549
00:33:01,459 --> 00:33:02,499
- Not yet.

550
00:33:02,792 --> 00:33:04,624
But we're quietly confident,
you might say.

551
00:33:04,917 --> 00:33:06,624
- Did he have any large sum
of money on him?

552
00:33:06,917 --> 00:33:10,624
- No, but his prints matched the
prints on one of the coffee cups

553
00:33:10,917 --> 00:33:15,749
and on one of the port glasses
from Foscatini's dining room.

554
00:33:16,042 --> 00:33:18,416
- And the motive of Asciano?

555
00:33:18,709 --> 00:33:20,666
- Eh, well,
got a bit of news there, Poirot.

556
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:22,124
- News?

557
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:25,999
- Signor Mario Asciano is
on our register of the Masnada.

558
00:33:26,292 --> 00:33:28,458
- Go on.

559
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,124
- What do you mean, "Go on?"

560
00:33:30,417 --> 00:33:31,583
You asked about the motive.

561
00:33:31,875 --> 00:33:32,999
Well, there you are.

562
00:33:33,292 --> 00:33:34,749
It's the usual Masnada stuff.

563
00:33:35,042 --> 00:33:37,124
Blackmail, murder.

564
00:33:43,875 --> 00:33:44,916
- What will you do now,
Monsieur Graves?

565
00:33:45,209 --> 00:33:46,708
Look for another situation?

566
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,583
- Yes, I shall have to, sir,

567
00:33:48,875 --> 00:33:50,374
and they're not easy
to come by these days.

568
00:33:50,667 --> 00:33:51,708
- No, indeed.

569
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,333
Oh, Monsieur Graves.

570
00:33:53,625 --> 00:33:56,416
On the night of the murder
of Count Foscatini,

571
00:33:56,709 --> 00:33:57,874
these curtains
in the dining room,

572
00:33:58,167 --> 00:34:02,124
they were not drawn.

573
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:03,833
- Not drawn, sir?

574
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,249
- No.

575
00:34:05,542 --> 00:34:09,333
No, they were open
just as they are now.

576
00:34:09,625 --> 00:34:11,374
- But--

577
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:13,624
But I'm sure I drew them, sir.

578
00:34:13,917 --> 00:34:17,749
Yes, before I announced dinner,
I drew them.

579
00:34:18,042 --> 00:34:20,666
Unless the count
drew them back himself.

580
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:23,249
- Why should he do that?

581
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,666
- Well, perhaps he wanted to see
something outside.

582
00:34:34,209 --> 00:34:36,291
- Perhaps.

583
00:34:49,792 --> 00:34:52,083
- You know, I don't understand
this case at all, Poirot.

584
00:34:52,375 --> 00:34:54,458
- No, it is a puzzle, Hastings.

585
00:34:59,625 --> 00:35:02,749
Hastings, come here
for a moment, please.

586
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,208
- What is it?
- Look.

587
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,541
I raise my right hand, yes?
- Yes.

588
00:35:07,834 --> 00:35:08,791
- Good.

589
00:35:09,084 --> 00:35:10,458
Now tell me what
do you see in the mirror.

590
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:12,374
- What do you mean,
"What do I see in the mirror?"

591
00:35:12,667 --> 00:35:14,208
- Just describe to me
what you see, Hastings.

592
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,666
- You're lifting your hand.
- Good.

593
00:35:15,959 --> 00:35:17,416
Which hand?
- Your right hand.

594
00:35:17,709 --> 00:35:19,749
- It does not appear to you
that I'm lifting my left?

595
00:35:20,042 --> 00:35:22,291
- No.

596
00:35:22,584 --> 00:35:26,624
- Be my reflection, Hastings.

597
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:30,124
Now, which hand are you raising
as I raise my right?

598
00:35:30,417 --> 00:35:31,958
- I see what you mean.

599
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:34,333
I never thought about that.

600
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:36,958
It's really odd, isn't it?

601
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:38,833
- We have been looking
at this case

602
00:35:39,125 --> 00:35:40,624
as if in a mirror, Hastings.

603
00:35:40,917 --> 00:35:42,958
We have seen everything
the wrong way around.

604
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:44,999
- In what way?

605
00:35:46,334 --> 00:35:48,041
- Be so good as to collect
the Chief Inspector Japp

606
00:35:48,334 --> 00:35:50,083
and meet me at Addisland Court
at 3:00.

607
00:35:50,375 --> 00:35:52,458
- But, Poirot...

608
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,874
- Scusi, Signor Vizzini.

609
00:35:59,167 --> 00:36:02,333
Signor Poirot.

610
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:07,291
- I'm not used to people
calling unexpectedly.

611
00:36:07,584 --> 00:36:09,374
I usually send for them.

612
00:36:10,625 --> 00:36:13,499
- There is one question I have
to ask you, Monsieur Vizzini.

613
00:36:13,792 --> 00:36:16,583
- A question?

614
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:18,416
A glass of wine?

615
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:20,499
- No.

616
00:36:20,792 --> 00:36:23,541
Merci.

617
00:36:23,834 --> 00:36:26,833
The man who called himself
Count Foscatini...

618
00:36:27,125 --> 00:36:29,458
with what
was he blackmailing you?

619
00:36:35,042 --> 00:36:38,083
- Foscatini had letters
that would ruin me

620
00:36:38,375 --> 00:36:42,749
if their contents became known
to certain people.

621
00:36:43,042 --> 00:36:45,458
I sent one of my Masnadieri,
Asciano,

622
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,874
to buy back the letters.

623
00:36:48,167 --> 00:36:52,458
Asciano got the letters
and then decided to betray me,

624
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:56,291
and go into business
on his own account.

625
00:36:56,584 --> 00:36:58,083
He killed Foscatini

626
00:36:58,375 --> 00:37:01,791
and made off with the letters
and the money.

627
00:37:04,584 --> 00:37:06,708
- You have not answered
my question.

628
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,458
- The letters contained
certain information.

629
00:37:23,709 --> 00:37:25,291
Very well.

630
00:37:25,584 --> 00:37:27,958
They contained proof that
I was giving financial support

631
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:33,208
to several antifascist
organizations.

632
00:37:34,667 --> 00:37:36,124
- But, assuredly, that would
cause you no harm

633
00:37:36,417 --> 00:37:37,291
in this country.

634
00:37:37,584 --> 00:37:39,208
- My dear Signor Poirot,

635
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,166
several of my business interests

636
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:43,916
would have been destroyed
overnight.

637
00:37:44,209 --> 00:37:45,208
Signor Eliso,

638
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,249
whose motorcars your
Captain Hastings so admires,

639
00:37:48,542 --> 00:37:52,916
he is anxious
to please Papa Mussolini.

640
00:37:54,292 --> 00:37:57,124
He will close me down
without a second thought.

641
00:37:57,417 --> 00:37:59,916
- I can put your mind at rest
on that point, Monsieur Vizzini.

642
00:38:00,209 --> 00:38:04,083
The letters,
they have been destroyed.

643
00:38:04,375 --> 00:38:07,499
Asciano has burned them,
and as for your money,

644
00:38:07,792 --> 00:38:09,624
Asciano does not have it,

645
00:38:09,917 --> 00:38:13,541
and it is not in the apartment
of Count Foscatini.

646
00:38:13,834 --> 00:38:16,499
Perhaps there is some hiding
place of which you know

647
00:38:16,792 --> 00:38:17,583
where Foscatini--

648
00:38:17,834 --> 00:38:20,458
- Hiding place?

649
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,833
No, no, no.

650
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,333
- There is, however, one point

651
00:38:35,625 --> 00:38:38,124
about which
you are totally mistaken.

652
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:42,083
Asciano did not kill
Count Foscatini.

653
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,374
- There's only one place
it can be.

654
00:39:00,667 --> 00:39:02,416
- Perhaps.

655
00:39:34,584 --> 00:39:35,666
- When I said that we had been

656
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:37,624
looking at this case
the wrong way around,

657
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:40,749
it was because
I have been forced suddenly

658
00:39:41,042 --> 00:39:42,583
to think about the victim.

659
00:39:42,875 --> 00:39:45,208
And as soon as I did so,

660
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,999
I apprehended that the only way
that this case made any sense

661
00:39:48,292 --> 00:39:50,416
to me at all

662
00:39:50,709 --> 00:39:54,374
was that if Foscatini
was the blackmailer.

663
00:39:54,667 --> 00:39:58,374
- Are you trying to tell us that
Foscatini was a blackmailer too?

664
00:39:58,667 --> 00:40:00,458
- Not "too," Chief Inspector.

665
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:03,124
Foscatini was the blackmailer.

666
00:40:03,417 --> 00:40:05,083
- What do you mean?

667
00:40:05,375 --> 00:40:10,583
- The crucial point,
as I suspected from the start,

668
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:12,916
is the dinner that came down
from the kitchens above

669
00:40:13,209 --> 00:40:14,249
and was served at this table

670
00:40:14,542 --> 00:40:16,083
on the evening
of the 6th of May.

671
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:18,374
Do you remember of what
that meal consisted, Hastings?

672
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:20,833
- Uh, well, uh...

673
00:40:21,125 --> 00:40:23,041
I know there was some soup.

674
00:40:23,334 --> 00:40:24,416
- Flat ten.

675
00:40:24,709 --> 00:40:26,958
Order for two
from the a la carte menu

676
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,666
sent down by lift.

677
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:30,083
Soup Julienne,

678
00:40:30,375 --> 00:40:32,291
filet de sole Normande,

679
00:40:32,584 --> 00:40:33,624
tournedos of beef,

680
00:40:33,917 --> 00:40:36,166
and a rice soufflé.

681
00:40:36,459 --> 00:40:38,624
There was naught wrong
with my food, you know.

682
00:40:38,917 --> 00:40:41,666
- And what did we find left
on the table?

683
00:40:41,959 --> 00:40:42,749
- Two coffee cups,

684
00:40:43,042 --> 00:40:45,458
both with the remains
of black coffee,

685
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:47,583
a dish of fruit.

686
00:40:47,875 --> 00:40:50,166
Nobody's used their dessert
plates there.

687
00:40:50,459 --> 00:40:53,749
And two glasses,
both with the remains of port.

688
00:40:54,042 --> 00:40:55,749
- Well done, Hastings.

689
00:40:56,042 --> 00:41:01,499
But, you see, Foscatini,
he did not eat any dinner.

690
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:04,166
- I beg your pardon.

691
00:41:04,459 --> 00:41:06,249
- The report of the post mortem
from the pathologist

692
00:41:06,542 --> 00:41:09,499
revealed that the stomach,
it was quite empty.

693
00:41:11,084 --> 00:41:16,541
So let us suppose that Asciano
made a visit to Addisland Court

694
00:41:16,834 --> 00:41:20,416
to this apartment
only the one time.

695
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:23,708
That would have been the day
before the murder.

696
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,083
You'll remember what
Monsieur Graves told us.

697
00:41:26,375 --> 00:41:27,916
- I'm here to see
Count Foscatini.

698
00:41:28,209 --> 00:41:29,708
- What name shall I say, sir?

699
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,791
- Mario Asciano.

700
00:41:31,042 --> 00:41:32,291
He's expecting me.

701
00:41:32,584 --> 00:41:35,458
- I showed him in, although the
Count hadn't said he was coming.

702
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,333
- I'd like to order lunch
for two.

703
00:41:37,625 --> 00:41:38,833
Flat ten.

704
00:41:39,125 --> 00:41:42,499
- I know they had lunch because
I heard the Count order it.

705
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:46,291
Signor Asciano seemed
to have something in his case

706
00:41:46,584 --> 00:41:48,374
which he was offering the Count.

707
00:41:48,667 --> 00:41:52,708
I'm not really sure, but I think
he was demanding money for it.

708
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,874
- But if Asciano didn't
come here that night, who did?

709
00:41:56,167 --> 00:41:57,583
Who ate the dinner?

710
00:41:57,875 --> 00:42:00,083
- The question answers itself,
does it not, Chief Inspector?

711
00:42:00,375 --> 00:42:02,958
Who told us of the second visit
of Asciano?

712
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,874
- Graves, the servant.

713
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:09,083
- I was suspicious when I saw

714
00:42:09,375 --> 00:42:10,916
that the victim
had replaced most carefully

715
00:42:11,209 --> 00:42:13,874
the telephone receiver.

716
00:42:14,167 --> 00:42:18,416
I knew when I saw the curtains,

717
00:42:18,709 --> 00:42:20,124
they were not closed.

718
00:42:20,417 --> 00:42:22,583
- But what have
the curtains got to do with it?

719
00:42:22,875 --> 00:42:24,583
- Count Foscatini
was already dead, mon ami,

720
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,999
by the time Monsieur Graves
ordered the dinner.

721
00:42:27,292 --> 00:42:29,458
- The count told me
the same gentleman

722
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:31,458
would be coming to dinner
this evening.

723
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:34,999
I served them dinner,
and after I brought in the port,

724
00:42:35,292 --> 00:42:38,333
the count told me I could have
the rest of the evening off.

725
00:42:38,625 --> 00:42:42,374
They went into the study,
and I went out.

726
00:42:47,959 --> 00:42:49,041
- There was only one person

727
00:42:49,334 --> 00:42:52,249
who could have killed
Count Foscatini:

728
00:42:52,542 --> 00:42:55,416
Monsieur Graves.

729
00:42:55,709 --> 00:43:00,083
What he told us about the second
visit was all lies.

730
00:43:00,375 --> 00:43:02,249
In the same way he deceived us
about his position,

731
00:43:02,542 --> 00:43:04,999
he deceived us about the events
of that night.

732
00:43:09,042 --> 00:43:10,291
And then in order to mislead us,

733
00:43:10,584 --> 00:43:13,083
our Monsieur Graves alters
the clock before he smashes it,

734
00:43:13,375 --> 00:43:16,166
and then he had to eat
both dinners himself.

735
00:43:16,459 --> 00:43:18,958
Of course he did not think
to close the curtains.

736
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:21,249
- But if he ate
both the dinners,

737
00:43:21,542 --> 00:43:23,499
how come
Asciano's fingerprints were on

738
00:43:23,792 --> 00:43:24,874
the glass and coffee cup?

739
00:43:25,167 --> 00:43:26,958
- He kept them back
from when Asciano really came

740
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:29,208
to lunch on the previous day.

741
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:32,333
- But why would he want
to kill his master?

742
00:43:32,625 --> 00:43:36,374
- For the cash his master
got from Asciano, that's why.

743
00:43:36,667 --> 00:43:39,208
He'll have enough money
to go anywhere he wants.

744
00:43:43,375 --> 00:43:45,458
Let's hope we're not too late.

745
00:43:50,584 --> 00:43:51,958
Sergeant Beddoes,

746
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:55,958
get an immediate watch put on
all ports for one Edwin Graves.

747
00:43:56,834 --> 00:43:59,458
Yes, that's right;
the servant.

748
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:01,208
And aerodromes.

749
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:05,416
"Wanted for the murder
of Count Foscatini."

750
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:06,499
- Wait a minute.

751
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:08,833
He's got his boat.
- Boat? Where?

752
00:44:09,125 --> 00:44:10,791
- Oh, wait a minute.

753
00:44:11,084 --> 00:44:11,874
Oh!

754
00:44:12,125 --> 00:44:13,458
Poirot, you remember
the photograph.

755
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:14,583
Oh, very trim.

756
00:44:14,875 --> 00:44:16,416
Where was it?

757
00:44:16,709 --> 00:44:18,166
Fantasia Felice.

758
00:44:18,459 --> 00:44:19,958
Where on Earth did he keep it?

759
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:21,708
Chichester!
- What?

760
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,583
- That's what it said.

761
00:44:23,875 --> 00:44:25,749
Fantasia Felice,
Chichester.

762
00:44:41,542 --> 00:44:43,624
- This must be where
it is hidden.

763
00:44:49,417 --> 00:44:51,208
- I hope you're right about
this, Captain Hastings.

764
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:52,416
- And so do I.

765
00:44:52,709 --> 00:44:54,291
- I know it was Chichester.

766
00:45:08,834 --> 00:45:09,999
- We've told the local police.

767
00:45:10,292 --> 00:45:11,916
They'll be standing by.

768
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:13,124
- I can't see anyone.

769
00:45:13,417 --> 00:45:15,499
- I've told 'em to stay
well hidden.

770
00:45:20,959 --> 00:45:23,583
- That's definitely the boat.

771
00:45:23,875 --> 00:45:26,333
And there's an Eliso-Freccia
parked right next to it.

772
00:45:29,792 --> 00:45:30,583
Look.

773
00:45:30,834 --> 00:45:32,416
- 'Allo.

774
00:45:32,709 --> 00:45:35,208
Graves' fancy woman.

775
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,874
- Well, she's heading
for the boat.

776
00:45:39,167 --> 00:45:40,708
- Poor Miss Lemon.

777
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,666
- Oh, my Lord.

778
00:45:42,959 --> 00:45:45,124
I'd forgotten about Miss Lemon.

779
00:45:46,459 --> 00:45:47,874
- Now what?

780
00:45:50,875 --> 00:45:52,583
- Better go on board.

781
00:45:58,250 --> 00:45:59,833
- You tell me now.

782
00:46:00,125 --> 00:46:02,166
Where is my money?

783
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:03,249
Hey!

784
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:04,291
- All right,
all right.

785
00:46:04,542 --> 00:46:06,624
What's going on?

786
00:46:16,459 --> 00:46:17,666
- All we have to find now
is the money.

787
00:46:17,959 --> 00:46:21,083
- And Graves.

788
00:46:25,084 --> 00:46:25,958
Hey!

789
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:27,166
That's him!

790
00:46:27,459 --> 00:46:29,541
Stop him!
Stop him!

791
00:46:39,959 --> 00:46:42,041
- Whoa--
oh!

792
00:46:59,834 --> 00:47:01,374
- Hey, watch out!

793
00:48:20,084 --> 00:48:21,124
- Hold it!

794
00:48:21,417 --> 00:48:22,499
Come on!
Get after him!

795
00:48:22,792 --> 00:48:23,833
- You swine!

796
00:48:25,959 --> 00:48:28,708
- That's for Miss Lemon.

797
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:34,041
- Come on.
Give us your hand.

798
00:48:34,334 --> 00:48:35,124
- Come on, you!

799
00:48:35,375 --> 00:48:36,916
- Out you come!

800
00:48:41,834 --> 00:48:45,541
- Edwin Graves, I'm arresting
you on a charge of murder.

801
00:48:45,834 --> 00:48:47,583
- Murder?

802
00:48:47,875 --> 00:48:50,416
He was nothing
but a bloody blackmailer.

803
00:48:50,709 --> 00:48:52,791
- Take him away.

804
00:48:55,792 --> 00:48:57,874
- Monsieur Poirot.

805
00:49:03,709 --> 00:49:05,749
- Sir!

806
00:49:06,042 --> 00:49:06,874
- Hey!

807
00:49:07,167 --> 00:49:10,916
It's my money!

808
00:49:11,209 --> 00:49:13,291
- No, it's evidence.

809
00:49:16,709 --> 00:49:18,833
Take Mrs. Graves to the car.

810
00:49:23,125 --> 00:49:24,916
- I'm dreadfully sorry
about your car,

811
00:49:25,209 --> 00:49:26,249
Mr. Vizzini.

812
00:49:26,542 --> 00:49:30,374
- My car?

813
00:49:30,667 --> 00:49:31,833
No...

814
00:49:32,125 --> 00:49:34,916
It's your car.

815
00:49:35,209 --> 00:49:36,583
- My car?

816
00:49:36,875 --> 00:49:38,958
- I was on my way to deliver it
when...

817
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:50,833
- If Vizzini thinks I'm paying
him for that wreck,

818
00:49:51,125 --> 00:49:53,499
I'll tell the bank
to stop payment.

819
00:49:53,792 --> 00:49:56,374
- So it wasn't Graves' boat
at all.

820
00:49:56,667 --> 00:49:57,666
- No, Chief Inspector.

821
00:49:57,959 --> 00:49:59,749
It was another piece
of self-aggrandizement

822
00:50:00,042 --> 00:50:00,958
from Monsieur Graves.

823
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:02,041
No, it was not his.

824
00:50:02,292 --> 00:50:03,874
It belonged to his master.

825
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:05,374
- The Fantasia Felice.

826
00:50:05,667 --> 00:50:07,583
- No, Hastings;
The Fantasia Felice,

827
00:50:07,875 --> 00:50:11,541
"the happy dream."

828
00:50:11,834 --> 00:50:14,833
- The happy dream.

829
00:50:15,125 --> 00:50:17,999
- I shall not forgive
Monsieur Graves, Hastings.

830
00:50:18,292 --> 00:50:20,166
He, a married man,

831
00:50:20,459 --> 00:50:22,499
in the cold blood,
used pauvres Miss Lemon

832
00:50:22,792 --> 00:50:25,083
to gain access to Poirot

833
00:50:25,375 --> 00:50:27,124
and to plant into our minds
a story ridiculous

834
00:50:27,417 --> 00:50:29,499
of his master working
for the Italian government.

835
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:36,541
- I'll talk to Miss Lemon
if you like.

836
00:50:38,875 --> 00:50:41,166
- No, thank you, Hastings.

837
00:50:41,459 --> 00:50:43,541
It is the duty of Poirot.

838
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:03,833
- Yes, Mr. Poirot?

839
00:51:04,125 --> 00:51:09,541
- Miss Lemon,
Edwin has been arrested.

840
00:51:10,917 --> 00:51:12,416
- Edwin?

841
00:51:12,709 --> 00:51:14,624
- Yes, Monsieur Graves.

842
00:51:14,917 --> 00:51:17,999
- Good.
It's about time.

843
00:51:20,584 --> 00:51:21,999
- Miss Lemon?

844
00:51:23,125 --> 00:51:25,541
- Do you know what
he was going to do?

845
00:51:25,834 --> 00:51:27,166
- No.

846
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:31,541
- He was going to have to move
out of Count Foscatini's flat,

847
00:51:31,834 --> 00:51:35,708
so he was going to have
the Count's cat destroyed.

848
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,541
Couldn't be bothered
to find a home for it.
