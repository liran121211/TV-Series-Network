1
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,499
- Barton, please.

2
00:01:38,792 --> 00:01:40,041
- Don't try to stop me, Pauline.

3
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:41,541
I have to do it.

4
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,749
- I'm afraid.

5
00:01:45,042 --> 00:01:46,249
- Don't be.

6
00:01:48,334 --> 00:01:50,833
Two years almost to the day.

7
00:01:53,834 --> 00:01:57,374
He will rest, Iris.
I swear it.

8
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,124
- Good morning, Poirot.

9
00:02:19,417 --> 00:02:20,708
- Bonjour, Hastings.

10
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,333
- Is that all you're having?

11
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:26,708
- What more is there to have?

12
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,874
- A decent English breakfast.
- And what is that, Hastings?

13
00:02:29,167 --> 00:02:32,249
- Well, porridge, two eggs,
sausage, bacon, tomato,

14
00:02:32,542 --> 00:02:34,041
toast and marmalade,
and a pot of tea.

15
00:02:34,334 --> 00:02:35,124
That's what I had, anyway.

16
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:37,749
- After such a meal of things,
I think I will return to my bed.

17
00:02:38,042 --> 00:02:40,249
No, no, no.
This will suffice for Poirot.

18
00:02:40,542 --> 00:02:41,833
- Is there anything
in the English cuisine

19
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:42,958
that you like, Poirot?

20
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,958
- The English, they do not have
a cuisine, my friend.

21
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,874
They have only the food.
- Well, that's a bit harsh.

22
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,083
- Like the meat, overcooked.
The vegetables, too soft.

23
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:50,666
The cheese, inedible.

24
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,833
And the day the English create
their own wines

25
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:55,624
is the day I return home
to Belgium.

26
00:02:55,917 --> 00:02:59,333
- Oh, this new restaurant should
be right up your street then.

27
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:02,208
Le Jardin des Cygnes.

28
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,416
It's opening this week
in Jermyn Street.

29
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:07,291
They say it'll serve
the best French food in London,

30
00:03:07,584 --> 00:03:08,708
all flown in specially.

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,208
- Le Jardin des Cygnes.

32
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,458
That name,
it is familiar to me.

33
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:18,624
- The garden of scenes?

34
00:03:18,917 --> 00:03:21,291
- Swans, Hastings.
Swans.

35
00:03:21,584 --> 00:03:23,416
- Oh, well, perhaps they'll be
on the menu.

36
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:25,458
It all looks very exotic.

37
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,499
What do you say, Poirot?
Dinner for two?

38
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,208
- I say, Hastings,
it is time for work.

39
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:35,958
Thank you.

40
00:03:37,834 --> 00:03:39,541
And there is Miss Lemon.

41
00:03:39,834 --> 00:03:41,291
Juste a l'heure.

42
00:03:44,584 --> 00:03:46,041
- Good morning, Mr. Poirot.

43
00:03:46,334 --> 00:03:47,708
- Bonjour, Miss Lemon.

44
00:03:51,334 --> 00:03:52,541
What is it that you have there?

45
00:03:52,834 --> 00:03:54,249
- I found it with the post.

46
00:03:54,542 --> 00:03:56,249
I suppose someone must have
left it for you.

47
00:03:56,542 --> 00:03:59,124
An admirer, perhaps?

48
00:03:59,417 --> 00:04:02,124
- The yellow iris.

49
00:04:02,417 --> 00:04:05,583
First Le Jardin des Cygnes,
and now this.

50
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,333
It is a conspiracy.
- Poirot.

51
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,249
- Hastings, why do you now
mention this restaurant to me?

52
00:04:09,542 --> 00:04:11,166
And you, Miss Lemon.
- I didn't mean to upset you.

53
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,499
- The yellow iris.

54
00:04:13,792 --> 00:04:15,458
It returns to provoke me.

55
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,291
- I say, old chap,
are you feeling all right?

56
00:04:32,584 --> 00:04:34,708
- Can I get you anything,
Mr. Poirot?

57
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,583
- No, thank you, Miss Lemon.
Please, do sit.

58
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:52,124
There is something
I must get out of my chest.

59
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,541
- The yellow iris.

60
00:04:53,834 --> 00:04:56,833
- Yes, Hastings,
the yellow iris.

61
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,166
It reminds me of a case
that I was not able to solve.

62
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:00,458
- I don't believe it.

63
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,166
- Through no fault of my own,
Miss Lemon.

64
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:06,041
You will recall, Hastings,

65
00:05:06,334 --> 00:05:07,374
that you once asked me
to visit you

66
00:05:07,667 --> 00:05:08,874
when you were living
in the Argentine?

67
00:05:09,167 --> 00:05:10,624
- Well, that was two years ago.

68
00:05:10,917 --> 00:05:11,708
And you were going to come,

69
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,666
but you canceled
at the last minute.

70
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:14,958
- That is true.
I said as much.

71
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,041
But it was not quite like that.

72
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:23,374
I was looking forward to
my visit to you, Hastings.

73
00:05:23,667 --> 00:05:26,749
It was to be my first time
in the Argentine.

74
00:05:27,042 --> 00:05:28,624
I broke my journey
in Buenos Aires

75
00:05:28,917 --> 00:05:31,958
and was due to travel
to your ranch in Los Pampas.

76
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,791
However,
because a general strike

77
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:36,624
had disrupted
the transport services,

78
00:05:36,917 --> 00:05:39,041
I was forced to book
into a hotel.

79
00:05:43,084 --> 00:05:44,499
- You are a liar and a cheat,

80
00:05:44,792 --> 00:05:46,749
and I don't ever want
to see you again!

81
00:05:47,042 --> 00:05:47,833
- Pauline.

82
00:05:48,084 --> 00:05:49,208
- All those things
you said to me,

83
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,916
all those promises
you made.

84
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:52,791
You're not interested
in me at all.

85
00:05:53,084 --> 00:05:53,874
- That's not true.

86
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:55,208
- You're just using me to get

87
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,083
your rotten interview
with Barton!

88
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,708
- I meant what I said.

89
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,041
I'm in love with you.

90
00:06:02,334 --> 00:06:03,624
It's true;
I do want the interview.

91
00:06:03,917 --> 00:06:05,208
- Well, the answer is no.

92
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,541
I won't help you.

93
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:07,666
You can't come to the dinner,

94
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:09,874
and I don't want
to see you again.

95
00:06:18,084 --> 00:06:20,291
- The path of true love?

96
00:06:20,584 --> 00:06:23,208
- It was all going
so smoothly until--

97
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,624
Wait a minute.
I know you.

98
00:06:25,917 --> 00:06:27,208
I've seen your picture.

99
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,999
You're Hercule Poirot.

100
00:06:30,292 --> 00:06:31,583
The rumors are
that President Yrigoyen

101
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:32,999
can't last much longer.

102
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:34,874
- He is old?
- 79.

103
00:06:35,167 --> 00:06:36,958
That's not the point.

104
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,249
He's out of touch.

105
00:06:38,542 --> 00:06:39,666
He's got the military
on one side

106
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:40,791
and the Catholics
on the other.

107
00:06:41,084 --> 00:06:42,333
It's just a matter of time
before one of them

108
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:43,749
pushes him out.

109
00:06:44,042 --> 00:06:45,583
- It is for this reason
that you are here?

110
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,583
- No, I'm following
Barton Russell

111
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,791
and his partner,
Stephen Carter.

112
00:06:50,084 --> 00:06:50,916
In fact,
that's Carter over there

113
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:53,458
with a drink in his hand.

114
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,708
There's been a huge oil strike
down in the south,

115
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,458
and they're after
the concession.

116
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,833
They set up
the company together:

117
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:00,124
Sovereign Oil.

118
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:02,666
- Thank you.

119
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:04,791
- Santé.

120
00:07:05,084 --> 00:07:06,124
- Cheers.

121
00:07:09,084 --> 00:07:12,958
- So tell me,

122
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,708
what of your young lady?

123
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,958
- Pauline Wetherby.

124
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,791
You must've heard about
the beautiful Wetherby girls.

125
00:07:20,084 --> 00:07:22,333
Pauline and Iris,
daughters of Lord Wetherby.

126
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,083
- No.

127
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:25,583
- He was a Labor Peer.

128
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,208
He made his fortune in textiles.

129
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,041
When he died, Iris got it all.

130
00:07:30,334 --> 00:07:32,708
- And Iris Wetherby,
she is also here?

131
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,791
- Of course.

132
00:07:34,084 --> 00:07:35,499
She's Barton Russell's wife.

133
00:07:35,792 --> 00:07:37,374
- Ah.
- She'll be there tonight.

134
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:38,999
Le Jardin des Cygnes.

135
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,541
Barton's having a big dinner.

136
00:07:40,834 --> 00:07:43,124
And I was trying to get Pauline
to invite me.

137
00:07:43,417 --> 00:07:45,791
You see, I think Barton
Russell's up to something,

138
00:07:46,084 --> 00:07:48,624
and I want to be the first
person to find out what.

139
00:07:52,417 --> 00:07:55,374
- So, General,
do we have a deal?

140
00:07:56,834 --> 00:07:59,458
- You have most persuasive,
Señor Russell.

141
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:06,791
Government bonds.

142
00:08:07,084 --> 00:08:09,166
- It seemed appropriate.

143
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:15,416
- Let us consider it
signed and sealed.

144
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:19,583
- There was, Hastings,
in the hotel, an atmosphere.

145
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,499
It was not just the heat
but the uncertainty.

146
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,624
I could also feel
a growing sense of unease

147
00:08:26,917 --> 00:08:28,333
and, indeed, of fear.

148
00:08:30,292 --> 00:08:31,583
- Oops, the lights.

149
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:34,624
I'm sorry, Señor.
Happens every day now.

150
00:08:34,917 --> 00:08:36,166
It's complete confusion.

151
00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:37,249
Have this one.

152
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,416
- Thank you.

153
00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:40,249
Room 217, if you please.

154
00:08:40,542 --> 00:08:41,749
- 217, yes.

155
00:08:44,292 --> 00:08:45,499
- Thank you.

156
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,166
- Mr. Poirot, isn't it?

157
00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:52,291
- Yes.

158
00:08:52,584 --> 00:08:54,541
- I saw you talking
to that writer.

159
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:57,791
You're--you're not here
on business, are you?

160
00:08:58,084 --> 00:08:59,124
- No, no, no, no, monsieur.

161
00:08:59,417 --> 00:09:00,374
I am en route to Los Pampas.

162
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:02,291
- Then I should get a move on
if I were you.

163
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:04,958
Pretty dangerous round here.

164
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,291
Buenos Aires really isn't
the place to be.

165
00:09:07,584 --> 00:09:08,458
- You are most kind,
monsieur.

166
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,749
Thank you.

167
00:09:10,042 --> 00:09:11,083
- Thank you.

168
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:12,166
- Oh, hello, Iris.

169
00:09:12,417 --> 00:09:13,541
- What's happened
to the electricity?

170
00:09:13,834 --> 00:09:15,624
Oh, don't tell me
it's another power cut.

171
00:09:15,917 --> 00:09:16,999
May I have my key, please?

172
00:09:17,292 --> 00:09:18,249
- Iris, I need to speak to you.

173
00:09:18,542 --> 00:09:20,124
- Now?
- May I take this?

174
00:09:20,417 --> 00:09:21,208
- Yes, of course.

175
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,291
- Where's Barton?

176
00:09:22,542 --> 00:09:25,166
- I don't know.
I haven't seen him.

177
00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:26,874
- Who's that man
you're talking to?

178
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:28,499
- Nobody.

179
00:09:28,792 --> 00:09:29,874
Only a tourist.

180
00:09:30,167 --> 00:09:32,583
- I didn't think there were
any tourists in Buenos Aires.

181
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:33,666
It's hardly the time.

182
00:09:33,917 --> 00:09:35,916
- That's what I've been trying
to tell him.

183
00:09:38,834 --> 00:09:40,083
Iris!

184
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,749
I beg you.

185
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:43,958
You don't know
what you're doing.

186
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,083
- I know exactly
what I'm doing.

187
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:46,541
I'm going to stop it.
- It's too late.

188
00:09:46,834 --> 00:09:48,499
- For you maybe.

189
00:09:48,792 --> 00:09:50,166
- Iris, please.

190
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:52,333
You'll destroy me.

191
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,083
- You should've thought of that
before you got involved

192
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:55,333
in an affair like this.

193
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:56,541
- What does it matter?

194
00:09:56,834 --> 00:09:57,916
Nobody knows about it.

195
00:09:58,209 --> 00:09:59,958
- I know.

196
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,624
And I can't live with it,
Stephen.

197
00:10:01,917 --> 00:10:04,291
I just can't live with it.

198
00:10:06,084 --> 00:10:08,833
- Never will I forget
the words of Iris Wetherby,

199
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,041
for it was then that I resolved
that I, too,

200
00:10:11,334 --> 00:10:12,499
would take dinner that night

201
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:15,583
at the restaurant called
Le Jardin des Cygnes.

202
00:10:30,084 --> 00:10:31,833
- Barton, cariño.

203
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:33,541
It is sweet of you
to invite me.

204
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:35,666
- Lola.

205
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:38,166
You look wonderful.

206
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:39,708
- Let me introduce you.

207
00:10:41,667 --> 00:10:43,458
You know my wife, Iris.

208
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,541
- Of course.

209
00:10:44,834 --> 00:10:47,041
- Pauline, her sister.
- Enchanted.

210
00:10:47,334 --> 00:10:50,666
- And this is my new partner,
Stephen Carter.

211
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,374
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

212
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:54,333
- Lola Valdez.

213
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,374
Her dancing is the talk
of the Argentine.

214
00:10:56,667 --> 00:10:58,166
- Ah.

215
00:10:58,459 --> 00:10:59,749
You will forgive me, Barton.

216
00:11:00,042 --> 00:11:03,249
I bring with me
a young English friend.

217
00:11:03,542 --> 00:11:05,624
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

218
00:11:05,917 --> 00:11:07,791
- He's a periodista,
a journalist.

219
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,333
And he will write
a grand piece on me

220
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,416
to tell the whole of England
about me.

221
00:11:13,792 --> 00:11:15,833
- He's doing us all
a favor.

222
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,833
Please, Mr. Chapell,
join us.

223
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:22,416
- Señorita, if you will just
move over to make some room.

224
00:11:24,167 --> 00:11:26,958
- Why, you certainly
got a nerve, Mr. Chapell.

225
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,458
- I had to get in somehow.
- To get your story?

226
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,708
- Hell with the story.
I came to see you.

227
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,041
- Señorita.

228
00:11:34,417 --> 00:11:36,624
- The food here is said
to be excellent.

229
00:11:39,459 --> 00:11:42,208
- You did not see
my new revue, Mrs. Russell.

230
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,708
- No.
I'm not fond of dancing.

231
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,624
- You missed a wonderful
performance, darling.

232
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:50,708
- I like to dance
before I eat.

233
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,041
Barton.

234
00:11:54,584 --> 00:11:56,374
- Do you mind?

235
00:11:56,667 --> 00:11:58,999
- No.
You enjoy yourself.

236
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,833
- The city, it was about
to ignite, Hastings.

237
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,499
The military,
it was everywhere.

238
00:12:28,792 --> 00:12:31,416
And many of the streets,
they were closed.

239
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,249
This was the background
against which

240
00:12:33,542 --> 00:12:37,208
the dinner of Barton Russell
was to take place.

241
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:42,958
- Allow me to introduce myself.

242
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,999
I am Luigi de Monico,
le patron.

243
00:12:46,292 --> 00:12:48,291
Welcome to
Le Jardin des Cygnes.

244
00:12:48,584 --> 00:12:50,333
- You are too kind,
Signor Luigi,

245
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:51,458
but you must excuse
my lateness.

246
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,541
I was delayed.

247
00:12:52,792 --> 00:12:54,083
There is some disturbance
in the town.

248
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,458
- In this town, there is always
some disturbance.

249
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,541
Please.

250
00:12:57,834 --> 00:13:00,124
The best table
for my distinguished guest.

251
00:13:00,417 --> 00:13:01,624
- Thank you.

252
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,916
- Thank you, Barton.
Thank you.

253
00:13:07,334 --> 00:13:09,124
- Ah, that was fun.

254
00:13:10,292 --> 00:13:12,124
- It's that detective.

255
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:13,666
What's he doing here?

256
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,458
- It's a free country.

257
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,208
At least it was when we came in.

258
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,499
- Which reminds me,

259
00:13:19,792 --> 00:13:21,583
I have to telephone
my stock broker in London

260
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,624
before he goes to bed.

261
00:13:23,917 --> 00:13:25,583
Please excuse me.

262
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,041
Merci.

263
00:13:49,334 --> 00:13:52,083
I see you favor
the red rose of England.

264
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,499
- If it disturbs you,
Signor, I have it removed.

265
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,791
- No, no, no, no, no.
Pas de tout.

266
00:13:57,084 --> 00:13:58,916
It is a symmetry
over here.

267
00:13:59,209 --> 00:14:01,999
On all of the tables,
the red rose,

268
00:14:02,292 --> 00:14:05,499
except on that one table,
the yellow iris.

269
00:14:05,792 --> 00:14:07,416
- It is a command,
Monsieur,

270
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:08,999
a special order.

271
00:14:09,292 --> 00:14:11,999
They are the favorite flowers
of la bella signora.

272
00:14:12,292 --> 00:14:15,208
- Ah.
Madame Iris Russell.

273
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,791
- Her husband insisted.

274
00:14:17,084 --> 00:14:18,541
A true romantico.

275
00:14:18,834 --> 00:14:22,083
Please, enjoy your meal.

276
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:23,624
- Merci.

277
00:15:08,917 --> 00:15:10,666
- I've heard her before.
- Ah.

278
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,583
- I like her very much.
I'd like to use her when I--

279
00:15:13,917 --> 00:15:16,624
- Ladies, gentlemen,

280
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:18,208
I want to make a toast.

281
00:15:19,542 --> 00:15:22,208
A man is never happier
to have his friends around him

282
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,749
than when he's in a foreign city
far from home.

283
00:15:25,042 --> 00:15:25,916
- Yes.

284
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:29,416
- So my toast is to you,

285
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:33,374
and especially to
my dear wife, Iris.

286
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:36,666
What can I say?

287
00:15:39,084 --> 00:15:41,958
Well, in the words
of the song,

288
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,333
I shall think of you
until I die.

289
00:15:47,209 --> 00:15:48,624
Iris.

290
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:51,041
Iris.

291
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,374
- Thank you.

292
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:11,208
- What's the matter?

293
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,624
- Iris?

294
00:16:21,792 --> 00:16:23,958
- Excuse me.
Excuse me.

295
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:34,583
I'm sorry.

296
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:37,291
- No.

297
00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:51,166
Potassium cyanide.

298
00:16:51,459 --> 00:16:52,999
- It's not possible.

299
00:17:05,917 --> 00:17:07,041
- Voilà.

300
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,791
- What are you saying?

301
00:17:12,084 --> 00:17:15,916
Iris didn't kill herself.
She'd never kill herself.

302
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:17,333
No.
- My God.

303
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:21,458
- I suggest you touch nothing
until the police arrive.

304
00:17:28,167 --> 00:17:30,999
My worst fears
had been realized.

305
00:17:31,292 --> 00:17:33,083
And yet even as I prepared
to investigate

306
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,083
the death of Iris Russell,

307
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:37,499
events were taking over.

308
00:17:37,792 --> 00:17:39,833
When I came down to breakfast
the next day,

309
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,499
the hotel,
it was deserted.

310
00:17:41,792 --> 00:17:44,749
The guests and the staff,
it seemed, had fled.

311
00:17:48,917 --> 00:17:51,041
- Mr. Poirot,
have you heard the news?

312
00:17:51,334 --> 00:17:53,208
It's incredible.
There's been a coup d'état.

313
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,291
President Yrigoyen--
the rumors are he's been shot.

314
00:17:56,584 --> 00:17:59,333
In any event,
the military are in control.

315
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,624
- Well, then it appears you will
have your story after all.

316
00:18:01,917 --> 00:18:03,666
- What with everything today
and Iris, I--

317
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:06,333
- I'm sorry.

318
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:11,916
- Once again, mademoiselle,
you have my condolences.

319
00:18:13,417 --> 00:18:16,499
- I just can't believe it,
Mr. Poirot.

320
00:18:16,792 --> 00:18:19,041
Iris would never have
killed herself.

321
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:27,791
- You are Hercule Poirot?

322
00:18:28,084 --> 00:18:29,041
- Yes, I am.

323
00:18:29,334 --> 00:18:30,958
- You are under arrest.

324
00:18:31,959 --> 00:18:33,874
- Wait a minute.
- Be silent.

325
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,791
You come now.

326
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:38,041
- Here, señor.
- No.

327
00:18:38,334 --> 00:18:40,583
- Don't worry, Monsieur Poirot.
I'll call the French Embassy.

328
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:43,749
- No, no, no, no!
The Belgian Embassy!

329
00:19:10,334 --> 00:19:12,583
- We know all about you,
Señor Poirot.

330
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:15,333
You're here to engage
in espionage.

331
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:18,124
- Cet imbécile.
You have my passport?

332
00:19:18,417 --> 00:19:19,458
- A forgery.

333
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:22,416
Do you appreciate that

334
00:19:22,709 --> 00:19:26,374
I could have you taken
outside now and shot?

335
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:28,208
- I wish to see the consul.

336
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,666
- You will see no one.

337
00:19:30,959 --> 00:19:34,041
There is a ship leaving
Ensenada in one hour.

338
00:19:34,334 --> 00:19:35,541
You will be on it.

339
00:19:37,292 --> 00:19:38,499
No argument.

340
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:42,541
Deportalo.

341
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,624
- And that was the end of it.

342
00:20:20,834 --> 00:20:24,333
I was taken to a ship
and deported on the same day

343
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,416
in a cabin of the third class.

344
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:30,208
- So that's why
you never came.

345
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,333
But why on earth
didn't you tell me?

346
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:35,124
- Hercule Poirot,
arrested and deported

347
00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:37,041
like a common criminal?

348
00:20:37,334 --> 00:20:39,708
It was something that
I preferred not to describe.

349
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,208
- So who did kill
Iris Russell?

350
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,708
- It was never discovered,
Miss Lemon.

351
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,833
The official verdict,
it was suicide.

352
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:48,708
Et c'est possible.

353
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,083
The body, it was sent back
to England.

354
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,374
The case,
it was closed.

355
00:20:53,667 --> 00:20:55,083
- Until now.

356
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,666
- Yes.

357
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,916
A yellow iris.

358
00:20:59,209 --> 00:21:01,541
- Do you think it could have
been sent to you as a warning?

359
00:21:03,834 --> 00:21:06,833
- A new Jardin des Cygnes opens
in London, eh.

360
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:10,041
And on the day it is announced,

361
00:21:10,334 --> 00:21:13,666
a yellow iris arrives
through the post.

362
00:21:13,959 --> 00:21:15,666
No.

363
00:21:15,959 --> 00:21:18,958
I think it comes rather
as a call for help.

364
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,124
- But from whom?

365
00:21:21,417 --> 00:21:23,999
- It is that
that we must now find out.

366
00:21:25,459 --> 00:21:26,541
- Who owned the restaurant,
Poirot?

367
00:21:26,834 --> 00:21:28,916
- His name, Hastings,
was Luigi, an Italian.

368
00:21:29,209 --> 00:21:30,708
- An Italian with
a French restaurant

369
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,541
in a South American city.

370
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:34,666
Now he's opened up here
in London.

371
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:36,749
- Signor Poirot!

372
00:21:37,042 --> 00:21:38,708
I'm so glad you are here.

373
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,791
- Signor Luigi.

374
00:21:40,042 --> 00:21:41,499
- It happens all over again.

375
00:21:41,792 --> 00:21:42,874
A disaster.

376
00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:46,583
Signor Russell, he telephones
to make a reservation.

377
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:50,124
Six people, he says,
just like last time.

378
00:21:50,417 --> 00:21:52,916
And once again,
he demands the yellow iris.

379
00:21:53,209 --> 00:21:56,333
This time,
la povera Signora Russell,

380
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:57,708
she is not here.

381
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,208
- They come on Friday?

382
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,583
- Si.

383
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:02,249
My opening night.

384
00:22:02,542 --> 00:22:04,624
- Exactly two years
since the last occasion.

385
00:22:04,917 --> 00:22:06,708
- Good Lord.

386
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,666
- And you say six places?

387
00:22:08,959 --> 00:22:10,708
Monsieur Barton Russell
and five others?

388
00:22:11,792 --> 00:22:12,916
- A reunion?

389
00:22:13,209 --> 00:22:15,916
- Hastings, I need a guide
to the London theaters.

390
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,166
- Let's take it
from the top, please.

391
00:22:18,459 --> 00:22:19,874
One, two, three, and...

392
00:23:08,417 --> 00:23:10,333
Okay, that's it till tonight.
Thank you very much.

393
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:11,416
Thank you.

394
00:23:12,834 --> 00:23:14,458
- Mademoiselle,

395
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:17,416
I was wondering whether
you remember that fateful night

396
00:23:17,709 --> 00:23:18,999
in Le Jardin des Cygnes,

397
00:23:19,292 --> 00:23:20,458
when were in Buenos Aires.

398
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,583
- Of course I remember.

399
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:24,916
That terrible night,
the police--such brutes.

400
00:23:25,209 --> 00:23:27,249
They asked so many questions,
and why?

401
00:23:27,542 --> 00:23:28,916
It was obvious.

402
00:23:29,209 --> 00:23:30,749
- You believe that
Madame Iris Russell,

403
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:32,124
she committed suicide?

404
00:23:32,417 --> 00:23:34,333
- Of course
she committed suicide.

405
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:35,749
- But for what reason?

406
00:23:36,042 --> 00:23:39,791
- Because she knew
Barton no longer loved her.

407
00:23:40,084 --> 00:23:41,583
- How well did you know her?

408
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:42,791
- I didn't know her.

409
00:23:43,084 --> 00:23:44,874
She never talked to me,
to a dancer.

410
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,458
- Have you seen since that time
Monsieur Barton Russell?

411
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,458
- Yes.
He's a good friend to me.

412
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,958
And I need the friends.

413
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,124
I have lost everything.

414
00:23:55,417 --> 00:23:57,583
- Did you have to leave
the Argentine?

415
00:23:57,875 --> 00:23:58,958
- The new regime.

416
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,041
I had too many friends
in the old government.

417
00:24:01,334 --> 00:24:03,458
And now I am in exile.

418
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,041
- It is the loss
of the Argentine.

419
00:24:05,334 --> 00:24:06,124
- Oh.

420
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:07,583
You are kind.

421
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:09,541
But tell me, Señor Poirot,

422
00:24:09,834 --> 00:24:12,041
what is your purpose
of your visit?

423
00:24:12,334 --> 00:24:15,249
- We came, Hastings and I,
to welcome you personally

424
00:24:15,542 --> 00:24:16,916
to this country

425
00:24:17,209 --> 00:24:19,374
and to inform you that we will
be attending your performance

426
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:20,458
on Friday night.

427
00:24:22,042 --> 00:24:23,541
Then I'm afraid
I must disappoint you.

428
00:24:23,834 --> 00:24:25,374
There is no performance.

429
00:24:25,667 --> 00:24:27,041
I have an arrangement
for dinner.

430
00:24:27,334 --> 00:24:28,124
- Oh.

431
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:30,416
- It is, in fact, amusing.

432
00:24:30,709 --> 00:24:33,624
You know there is now a new
Jardin des Cygnes in London?

433
00:24:33,917 --> 00:24:35,208
Well, I go there.

434
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:07,124
- How could you write this?

435
00:25:07,417 --> 00:25:08,999
I just don't understand you.

436
00:25:09,292 --> 00:25:11,166
- Pauline, I'm a journalist!

437
00:25:11,459 --> 00:25:12,833
- Anthony, you're a fink!

438
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:14,333
thud!

439
00:25:17,584 --> 00:25:20,333
- Pauline!
Come back, Pauline!

440
00:25:22,417 --> 00:25:23,583
Mr. Poirot.

441
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:25,374
- Very nice to see you again,
Monsieur Chapell.

442
00:25:25,667 --> 00:25:27,666
My associate,
Captain Hastings.

443
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,166
- Oh.
Come in.

444
00:25:29,459 --> 00:25:30,666
- Thank you.

445
00:25:34,875 --> 00:25:36,833
- Talk about history
repeating itself.

446
00:25:37,125 --> 00:25:38,458
Another row with Pauline,
and suddenly,

447
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:39,874
you show up again.

448
00:25:40,167 --> 00:25:41,999
And there's this dinner
on Friday.

449
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:44,708
- Oh, so you're invited too?
- Yes, and Pauline.

450
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,833
We're engaged to be married.

451
00:25:47,125 --> 00:25:48,083
At least, we were.

452
00:25:48,375 --> 00:25:50,416
After this little contratante,
who knows?

453
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,458
- It's for this reason
we are here.

454
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,708
You have spoken to
Monsieur Barton Russell?

455
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,291
- No.
He's lying low.

456
00:25:58,584 --> 00:25:59,916
If you want to know
the honest truth,

457
00:26:00,209 --> 00:26:02,083
it's Stephen Carter
I feel sorry for.

458
00:26:02,375 --> 00:26:03,166
- For what reason?

459
00:26:03,459 --> 00:26:06,083
He was never in Barton's league.

460
00:26:06,375 --> 00:26:08,791
He was basically a subcontractor
for the British government.

461
00:26:09,084 --> 00:26:10,374
They were backing him
to find oil

462
00:26:10,667 --> 00:26:12,208
somewhere up
in the north of England,

463
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,583
Derbyshire or somewhere.

464
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:16,458
- So why on earth did Barton
want to work with him?

465
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,333
- That's a good question.

466
00:26:18,625 --> 00:26:20,374
Anyway, Carter wanted
the big time.

467
00:26:20,667 --> 00:26:22,499
The oil concession's
worth millions.

468
00:26:22,792 --> 00:26:24,499
- This oil business,
it is always full of the risks,

469
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:25,583
n'est-ce pas?

470
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:29,208
- Yes, but they had
the concession in their hands.

471
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,541
They won it from a chap
called Pereira.

472
00:26:31,834 --> 00:26:32,708
- Pereira.

473
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,624
Wasn't he the one
who arrested you?

474
00:26:35,917 --> 00:26:37,083
- General Pereira, yes.

475
00:26:37,375 --> 00:26:39,874
- After the coup,
he became Minister of Oil.

476
00:26:40,167 --> 00:26:42,791
- But in your article, you say
that he is no longer in power?

477
00:26:43,084 --> 00:26:44,333
- Exactly.

478
00:26:44,625 --> 00:26:45,458
It seems he's been found

479
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,208
with his hand in the till
once too often

480
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,999
even for the Argentine
government.

481
00:26:49,292 --> 00:26:51,916
It looks like he's for the chop,
and if he goes,

482
00:26:52,209 --> 00:26:54,124
Sovereign Oil will go with him.

483
00:27:15,792 --> 00:27:16,583
- Cargen.

484
00:27:20,292 --> 00:27:21,916
Apunten.

485
00:27:22,209 --> 00:27:22,999
Fuego!

486
00:27:33,125 --> 00:27:36,374
- It's Mr. Poirot.

487
00:27:36,667 --> 00:27:38,416
Mr. Poirot,
is there not any comment

488
00:27:38,709 --> 00:27:42,291
about financial thieves...

489
00:27:42,584 --> 00:27:43,916
- Mr. Poirot, can you give us
any comment?

490
00:27:44,209 --> 00:27:44,999
Please, sir?

491
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:47,624
- Yes, Mr. Poirot,
I'm getting out.

492
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:49,749
Going back to what
I'm best at.

493
00:27:50,042 --> 00:27:51,541
- And what is that,
Monsieur Carter?

494
00:27:51,834 --> 00:27:53,583
- I had my own business,
you know,

495
00:27:53,875 --> 00:27:55,874
before Sovereign Oil,

496
00:27:56,167 --> 00:27:58,916
before Barton Russell.

497
00:28:00,167 --> 00:28:01,999
- And you now return
to this business?

498
00:28:02,292 --> 00:28:05,249
- Yes, if I can untangle it
from this mess.

499
00:28:05,542 --> 00:28:06,999
- But I understand that much
of your finance came

500
00:28:07,292 --> 00:28:08,083
from the government.

501
00:28:08,334 --> 00:28:09,124
- Yes.

502
00:28:09,417 --> 00:28:10,958
We were excavating for them

503
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,583
in Derbyshire
and up in Scotland.

504
00:28:12,875 --> 00:28:14,916
Interesting work.

505
00:28:15,209 --> 00:28:18,666
Although, of course,
there were only small returns.

506
00:28:18,959 --> 00:28:21,374
- I suppose that's what
attracted you to Sovereign.

507
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:24,874
- Yes.

508
00:28:25,167 --> 00:28:29,666
It was an adventure.

509
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:32,416
That strike in Santa Cruz.

510
00:28:32,709 --> 00:28:35,624
And if we'd held onto it...

511
00:28:35,917 --> 00:28:38,166
- But now you have lost
the concession, Monsieur Carter.

512
00:28:38,459 --> 00:28:39,416
- Yes.

513
00:28:39,709 --> 00:28:40,833
Just two more weeks,

514
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:44,249
and we'd have had
that oil flowing.

515
00:28:44,542 --> 00:28:47,999
We won that contract
fair and square, Mr. Poirot.

516
00:28:48,292 --> 00:28:50,958
And now we've got nothing.

517
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:53,833
And I'm out.

518
00:28:54,125 --> 00:28:56,458
- Thank you,
Monsieur Carter.

519
00:28:56,750 --> 00:29:00,833
One last question, if I may,
Monsieur Carter.

520
00:29:01,125 --> 00:29:04,541
Are you to see again
Monsieur Barton Russell?

521
00:29:04,834 --> 00:29:07,958
- As a matter of fact,

522
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:10,541
I'm dining with him
this week.

523
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:12,166
- At Le Jardin des Cygnes.

524
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:13,249
- Yes.

525
00:29:13,542 --> 00:29:16,958
I had a feeling that's why
you'd come here.

526
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:19,166
Two years to the day.

527
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,749
- I don't really see what
business it is of yours,

528
00:29:24,042 --> 00:29:25,249
Monsieur Poirot,

529
00:29:25,542 --> 00:29:27,916
if I choose to have
a private meal with friends.

530
00:29:28,209 --> 00:29:32,249
- You say friends,
and yet,

531
00:29:32,542 --> 00:29:34,499
one of them,
he is a journalist

532
00:29:34,792 --> 00:29:35,874
who has just written something
about you

533
00:29:36,167 --> 00:29:37,374
that is most unflattering,

534
00:29:37,667 --> 00:29:40,708
and the other is a businessman
who has decided

535
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,916
that he will do with you
no further business.

536
00:29:43,209 --> 00:29:44,416
- I see you've been busy.

537
00:29:44,709 --> 00:29:45,624
- Oui, bien sûr.

538
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:49,124
And there is one thing
that I still do not understand.

539
00:29:50,459 --> 00:29:51,833
- What is that?

540
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:55,708
- Anthony Chapell,
Stephen Carter, Lola Valdez,

541
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,124
Mademoiselle Pauline,
and your good self.

542
00:29:59,417 --> 00:30:01,291
That is five persons, huh?

543
00:30:01,584 --> 00:30:04,083
And yet the table,
it is for six.

544
00:30:05,417 --> 00:30:09,666
- As I said, Mr. Poirot,
it's none of your business.

545
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:14,166
- The sixth place is for Iris.

546
00:30:14,459 --> 00:30:15,249
- Comment?

547
00:30:15,542 --> 00:30:17,041
- It's a commemorative dinner:

548
00:30:17,334 --> 00:30:19,333
The second anniversary
of her death,

549
00:30:19,625 --> 00:30:21,374
and we've all got to be there.

550
00:30:21,667 --> 00:30:22,458
- Pauline.

551
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,833
- Well, I think
it's a horrible idea.

552
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:26,541
I don't want to go.

553
00:30:26,834 --> 00:30:29,416
- You will go, Pauline.

554
00:30:29,709 --> 00:30:30,666
- Yes.

555
00:30:30,959 --> 00:30:33,583
But you can't boss me around
forever, Barton.

556
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:36,166
Just one more month.

557
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:39,791
Excuse me.
I'm going to go home.

558
00:30:40,084 --> 00:30:41,291
- Mademoiselle.

559
00:30:45,042 --> 00:30:47,541
I'm sorry.

560
00:30:47,834 --> 00:30:48,708
Please.

561
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,124
- Thank you.

562
00:30:51,417 --> 00:30:55,624
- Anyway, now you know.

563
00:30:55,917 --> 00:30:58,208
- Monsieur Russell,
if you would be so kind

564
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,999
as to tell me,
this dinner,

565
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:03,208
why do you have it, huh?

566
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,083
Why do you wish to re-create

567
00:31:05,375 --> 00:31:06,999
the night of the death
of your wife?

568
00:31:07,292 --> 00:31:10,166
- All right,
I'll tell you.

569
00:31:10,459 --> 00:31:13,416
It's very simple,
Mr. Poirot.

570
00:31:13,709 --> 00:31:16,083
I know--

571
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:19,083
I have always known.

572
00:31:19,375 --> 00:31:23,166
Iris did not commit suicide.

573
00:31:23,459 --> 00:31:24,999
She was killed
by one of the people

574
00:31:25,292 --> 00:31:27,416
sitting at that table.

575
00:31:27,709 --> 00:31:31,999
And tomorrow night,
I intend to find out which.

576
00:31:32,292 --> 00:31:34,874
- Hastings, I must reserve
for myself immediately

577
00:31:35,167 --> 00:31:37,416
for tomorrow night a table
at Le Jardin des Cygnes.

578
00:31:37,709 --> 00:31:38,749
- You want to be in
at the kill, eh?

579
00:31:39,042 --> 00:31:39,999
- It is exactly that, Hastings.

580
00:31:40,292 --> 00:31:41,374
Twice it is arranged:

581
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:42,958
the dinner, the restaurant,
the guests.

582
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:46,916
And tomorrow night,
I must be there

583
00:31:47,209 --> 00:31:49,458
to prevent a second death.

584
00:32:02,875 --> 00:32:05,416
- I don't like you going
to this restaurant, Mr. Poirot.

585
00:32:05,709 --> 00:32:06,583
It could be dangerous.

586
00:32:06,875 --> 00:32:08,541
- Ah, but when Poirot himself
is involved,

587
00:32:08,834 --> 00:32:10,166
he, too, is dangerous,
Miss Lemon.

588
00:32:10,459 --> 00:32:12,958
- I still Captain Hastings
were going with you.

589
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:15,374
- Ah, yes.

590
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,666
The good captain Hastings.

591
00:32:17,959 --> 00:32:22,083
By now he should be in Norfolk,
the village of Reepham.

592
00:32:22,375 --> 00:32:25,249
- Why did you send him there,
Mr. Poirot?

593
00:32:25,542 --> 00:32:27,499
What do you want him to find?

594
00:32:27,792 --> 00:32:29,874
- A motive for murder.

595
00:32:38,709 --> 00:32:41,499
- Two years.

596
00:32:41,792 --> 00:32:43,624
Two years to the day.

597
00:32:43,917 --> 00:32:47,124
- I hope you don't mind
my coming here, Mr. Grove.

598
00:32:47,417 --> 00:32:50,416
- I'm very glad you did,
Captain Hastings.

599
00:32:50,709 --> 00:32:53,166
You see, I was
her father's solicitor.

600
00:32:53,459 --> 00:32:55,374
Lord Wetherby, you know.

601
00:32:55,667 --> 00:32:57,166
A wonderful man.

602
00:32:57,459 --> 00:32:59,333
Showed him the Ramsay MacDonald.

603
00:32:59,625 --> 00:33:01,749
- And Iris Russell inherited
his fortune.

604
00:33:02,042 --> 00:33:04,749
And his ideals.

605
00:33:05,042 --> 00:33:07,416
She was such a beautiful girl.

606
00:33:07,709 --> 00:33:09,791
It was a tragedy.

607
00:33:13,875 --> 00:33:16,208
- You were telling me
about Iris' will.

608
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,124
- Oh, there's no secret
about it.

609
00:33:18,417 --> 00:33:20,083
You see, her husband,
Barton Russell,

610
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:21,999
was a wealthy man
in his own right,

611
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:25,708
so her money was passed across
to her sister, Pauline,

612
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,041
to be held in trust
until her 21st birthday.

613
00:33:28,334 --> 00:33:29,666
- I suppose you were
the trust's administrator.

614
00:33:29,959 --> 00:33:30,749
- Oh, no.

615
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,791
Mr. Russell is
the administrator.

616
00:33:33,084 --> 00:33:36,458
His wife made him
Pauline's guardian.

617
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,541
- So if Pauline were to die,

618
00:33:38,834 --> 00:33:41,249
does that mean that Barton
would inherit the trust?

619
00:33:41,542 --> 00:33:43,208
- Uh, no.

620
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:46,999
You see, Pauline has made
a will of her own.

621
00:33:47,292 --> 00:33:49,791
Although--well, I mustn't
speculate

622
00:33:50,084 --> 00:33:51,458
about Pauline's intentions.

623
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:53,791
And yet...

624
00:33:54,084 --> 00:33:58,208
Sometimes, I feel afraid
for her.

625
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:02,499
Captain Hastings,
what I can tell you is this:

626
00:34:02,792 --> 00:34:05,916
when she signed the will,

627
00:34:06,209 --> 00:34:08,249
she was accompanied
by a young man.

628
00:34:08,542 --> 00:34:11,708
I assumed him to be
her fiancé.

629
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,124
Make of that what you will.

630
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,874
- Madame, welcome
to Le Jardin des Cygnes.

631
00:34:31,167 --> 00:34:32,374
Sir.

632
00:34:34,792 --> 00:34:35,999
- After you.

633
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:08,958
- Thank you.

634
00:35:47,959 --> 00:35:50,208
- So...

635
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,583
Here we all are.

636
00:36:00,292 --> 00:36:01,458
- Signor Poirot.

637
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:03,999
- Signor Luigi,
bonsoir.

638
00:36:04,292 --> 00:36:05,708
They are all here?
- Si.

639
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,749
And I have a message for you.

640
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:11,291
- Merci.

641
00:36:14,292 --> 00:36:16,958
Ah, from Captain Hastings.
C'est bien.

642
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:22,249
Signor Luigi,
that table you have for me?

643
00:36:22,542 --> 00:36:25,916
I have for it no further need.

644
00:36:28,334 --> 00:36:29,708
- I know it seems
a little odd,

645
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,666
celebrating
the second anniversary

646
00:36:31,959 --> 00:36:36,291
of a death in this way,
but I have a reason.

647
00:36:36,584 --> 00:36:38,874
And I think it's time
I explained.

648
00:36:41,959 --> 00:36:46,416
Two years ago,
my wife died

649
00:36:46,709 --> 00:36:50,541
at a table like this
in a room like this.

650
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:54,041
The same five people
surrounded her.

651
00:36:54,334 --> 00:36:57,874
The police--
The Argentine police--

652
00:36:58,167 --> 00:37:02,166
recorded a verdict
of suicide.

653
00:37:02,459 --> 00:37:06,083
But I have known--
I have always known--

654
00:37:06,375 --> 00:37:09,749
- And tonight, you wish
to establish the truth,

655
00:37:10,042 --> 00:37:12,291
Monsieur Russell.

656
00:37:12,584 --> 00:37:13,833
- Mr. Poirot.

657
00:37:14,125 --> 00:37:15,249
I wasn't expecting you.

658
00:37:15,542 --> 00:37:17,624
- But I was there
on the first night, was I not?

659
00:37:17,917 --> 00:37:18,708
- That's true.

660
00:37:18,959 --> 00:37:21,333
- And I also have a desire
to establish the truth,

661
00:37:21,625 --> 00:37:23,333
if you permit.

662
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:28,791
- Let him stay, Barton.

663
00:37:29,084 --> 00:37:31,041
- You're right, Mr. Poirot.
You should be here.

664
00:37:31,334 --> 00:37:32,666
You're welcome to join us.

665
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,166
- Thank you.

666
00:37:41,584 --> 00:37:43,708
- What's going on?

667
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,124
What were you going to say,
Barton?

668
00:37:45,417 --> 00:37:46,458
- Monsieur Russell was
about to say

669
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:48,208
that he believes his wife
was murdered

670
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,041
by someone seated
around this table.

671
00:37:51,334 --> 00:37:52,916
Wait a minute.

672
00:37:53,209 --> 00:37:54,291
- Who would've harmed her?

673
00:37:54,584 --> 00:37:55,749
It's--it's crazy.

674
00:37:56,042 --> 00:37:58,791
- Of course it is.

675
00:37:59,084 --> 00:38:01,499
Iris committed suicide.

676
00:38:01,792 --> 00:38:03,333
Everybody knows that.

677
00:38:03,625 --> 00:38:05,874
- I do not believe
that she committed suicide.

678
00:38:06,167 --> 00:38:08,083
- And I can prove it.

679
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,041
I have to speak to the band.

680
00:38:13,334 --> 00:38:15,666
I have a surprise for you.

681
00:38:17,292 --> 00:38:18,541
- Mr. Poirot,
can't you stop him?

682
00:38:18,834 --> 00:38:21,541
- Do not worry yourself,
Monsieur Carter.

683
00:38:21,834 --> 00:38:24,124
- Mr. Poirot,

684
00:38:24,417 --> 00:38:26,708
I'm afraid.

685
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,624
- There is no need,
mademoiselle.

686
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,666
My God.

687
00:38:58,959 --> 00:39:00,291
It's the same song.

688
00:39:00,584 --> 00:39:03,166
- The hell is he playing at?

689
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:26,374
- It takes you back,
doesn't it?

690
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:30,666
Come on, Carter.
Raise your glass.

691
00:40:30,959 --> 00:40:34,374
What was our toast
two years ago?

692
00:40:34,667 --> 00:40:38,666
To Iris.

693
00:40:38,959 --> 00:40:41,041
- Absolument.

694
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,958
To Iris.

695
00:40:54,334 --> 00:40:56,708
- Damn you, then.

696
00:41:02,125 --> 00:41:04,208
To Iris.

697
00:41:06,459 --> 00:41:09,041
- To Iris.
- To Iris.

698
00:41:09,334 --> 00:41:10,583
- To Iris.

699
00:41:12,917 --> 00:41:15,041
- So what now, Barton?

700
00:41:15,334 --> 00:41:16,541
What other things
are you going--

701
00:41:21,084 --> 00:41:22,374
- Oh, my goodness.

702
00:41:22,667 --> 00:41:24,166
- What on earth!

703
00:41:24,459 --> 00:41:26,416
- Good gracious.
- She's fallen dead.

704
00:41:28,084 --> 00:41:30,041
- No, that's not meant
to happen!

705
00:41:30,334 --> 00:41:32,791
- It is the same.

706
00:41:33,084 --> 00:41:34,499
- Oh, God.

707
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:36,083
- Pauline!

708
00:41:37,625 --> 00:41:39,124
- She is dead.

709
00:42:07,292 --> 00:42:10,333
La pauvre petite.

710
00:42:10,625 --> 00:42:13,166
And I, who thought
I could protect her.

711
00:42:13,459 --> 00:42:15,458
- Protect her.

712
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:16,791
You helped kill her.

713
00:42:19,834 --> 00:42:22,166
- I'm cold.

714
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:26,333
- I have sent for some coffee,
mademoiselle.

715
00:42:26,625 --> 00:42:29,124
- I'd prefer something stronger.

716
00:42:29,417 --> 00:42:31,666
- It's my fault.

717
00:42:31,959 --> 00:42:33,874
I should've known.

718
00:42:34,167 --> 00:42:37,083
Pauline always said

719
00:42:37,375 --> 00:42:39,583
she knew something about Iris.

720
00:42:39,875 --> 00:42:42,333
That was why she was killed.

721
00:42:42,625 --> 00:42:45,541
- No, Monsieur Russell.

722
00:42:45,834 --> 00:42:49,041
That was not the reason why
Mademoiselle Pauline had to die.

723
00:42:49,334 --> 00:42:51,333
- Then why?
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

724
00:42:51,625 --> 00:42:54,166
That is not the question
we must ask.

725
00:42:54,459 --> 00:42:57,791
We have here two murders.

726
00:43:01,167 --> 00:43:02,874
And in order to solve
the second,

727
00:43:03,167 --> 00:43:07,958
we must return two years
to the first.

728
00:43:09,375 --> 00:43:13,291
Why did Madame Iris Russell
have to die?

729
00:43:13,584 --> 00:43:15,874
- So you agree.
She was killed!

730
00:43:16,167 --> 00:43:17,874
- C'est évident.

731
00:43:19,125 --> 00:43:23,291
And there were perhaps
several reasons.

732
00:43:25,542 --> 00:43:27,958
For example,

733
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:32,374
she stood in between you
and Monsieur Russell.

734
00:43:32,667 --> 00:43:34,083
- Between us?

735
00:43:34,375 --> 00:43:35,999
Ridiculous!

736
00:43:36,292 --> 00:43:38,333
- She also stood between
her younger sister

737
00:43:38,625 --> 00:43:40,666
and the great fortune.

738
00:43:40,959 --> 00:43:42,958
- Pauline never cared
about the money.

739
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:45,374
- But you care
for Mademoiselle Pauline.

740
00:43:45,667 --> 00:43:47,874
You would not have been happy,
perhaps, to marry an heiress?

741
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,541
- What?

742
00:43:49,834 --> 00:43:53,708
So I killed Iris
so Pauline could inherit?

743
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,333
- And finally, she stood
in the way of you, Monsieur.

744
00:43:57,625 --> 00:44:01,249
- Me?
- Yes, you, Monsieur Carter.

745
00:44:01,542 --> 00:44:06,124
You and the biggest gamble
of your career.

746
00:44:10,542 --> 00:44:13,208
In the hotel in Buenos Aires,

747
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,083
I overheard.

748
00:44:15,375 --> 00:44:16,499
- Iris!

749
00:44:16,792 --> 00:44:18,749
You'll destroy me!

750
00:44:19,042 --> 00:44:20,958
- You should've thought of that
before you got involved

751
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:22,166
in an affair like this.

752
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:24,083
- What does it matter?

753
00:44:24,375 --> 00:44:25,374
Nobody knows about it.

754
00:44:25,667 --> 00:44:27,249
- I know!

755
00:44:27,542 --> 00:44:29,791
But I can't live with it,
Stephen.

756
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:32,499
- What was the affair of which
Madame Iris Russell spoke?

757
00:44:32,792 --> 00:44:34,083
- There was no affair.

758
00:44:34,375 --> 00:44:37,749
- No love affair, perhaps,
but the business affair.

759
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:41,166
Monsieur Carter, I can see
with the eyes of my mind,

760
00:44:41,459 --> 00:44:43,541
and I will speak.

761
00:44:47,209 --> 00:44:49,166
Please show us what you have
in your breast pocket.

762
00:44:49,459 --> 00:44:51,374
- What?

763
00:44:51,667 --> 00:44:52,458
What are you saying?

764
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:54,416
- Do what he says.

765
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:13,666
You put it there!

766
00:45:21,459 --> 00:45:24,166
- Potassium cyanide.

767
00:45:24,459 --> 00:45:27,499
The case,
it is complete.

768
00:45:29,084 --> 00:45:30,833
- Carter.

769
00:45:31,125 --> 00:45:33,833
I always knew it was you!

770
00:45:34,125 --> 00:45:34,916
- Why?

771
00:45:35,167 --> 00:45:36,083
- Why do you not tell us
what really happened

772
00:45:36,375 --> 00:45:37,499
in Buenos Aires,
Monsieur Carter?

773
00:45:37,792 --> 00:45:38,583
- I can't.

774
00:45:38,834 --> 00:45:40,083
- The shadow of a noose
hangs over you!

775
00:45:40,375 --> 00:45:41,999
- No!
- Very well.

776
00:45:42,292 --> 00:45:43,208
Then I will tell it!

777
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:44,958
- Your coffee, sir.

778
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:48,083
- Bring it in.

779
00:45:48,375 --> 00:45:50,124
The oil concessions
that were acquired

780
00:45:50,417 --> 00:45:52,374
by yourself
and Monsieur Russell,

781
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:54,333
they were not acquired
from the legitimate government

782
00:45:54,625 --> 00:45:56,541
of President Yrigoyen.

783
00:45:59,292 --> 00:46:01,791
- You're right.

784
00:46:02,084 --> 00:46:04,124
It was Barton's idea.

785
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,791
- So, General,
do we have a deal?

786
00:46:10,084 --> 00:46:11,583
- He could tell there was going
to be a coup.

787
00:46:11,875 --> 00:46:13,291
- Government bonds, hmm?

788
00:46:13,584 --> 00:46:15,874
- So he went straight to
the rebels to General Pereira.

789
00:46:16,167 --> 00:46:17,749
- And the money
that was paid,

790
00:46:18,042 --> 00:46:19,999
the money that would assist
the rebels to gain power,

791
00:46:20,292 --> 00:46:21,083
from where had it come?

792
00:46:21,375 --> 00:46:23,749
- It was mine.
- No, Monsieur Carter!

793
00:46:24,042 --> 00:46:26,166
It was money entrusted to you
by the government of Britain

794
00:46:26,459 --> 00:46:28,916
for excavations
in this country!

795
00:46:29,209 --> 00:46:29,999
- My God.

796
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:31,874
- And that is Madame Iris
Russell had discovered,

797
00:46:32,167 --> 00:46:36,541
and that is why
she had to be silenced!

798
00:46:36,834 --> 00:46:38,208
The daughter of a Labor Peer,

799
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,749
could she stand by and watch
as government funds were used

800
00:46:41,042 --> 00:46:42,624
to support the military junta?

801
00:46:42,917 --> 00:46:45,749
Of course not!
- And you killed her, Carter.

802
00:46:46,042 --> 00:46:48,833
- No.
Wait.

803
00:46:49,125 --> 00:46:53,208
Everything you say is true,
but I didn't kill her.

804
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:54,874
It was him!

805
00:46:55,167 --> 00:46:56,791
He had as much to lose as me!

806
00:46:57,084 --> 00:46:58,749
- But, Monsieur Carter,
you forget

807
00:46:59,042 --> 00:47:00,541
that Monsieur Russell,
he was not even at the table

808
00:47:00,834 --> 00:47:02,541
when the champagne,
it was being served.

809
00:47:02,834 --> 00:47:04,416
- Exactly.
- And tonight also.

810
00:47:04,709 --> 00:47:06,249
Barton was not there.

811
00:47:06,542 --> 00:47:07,499
- But wait a minute.

812
00:47:07,792 --> 00:47:09,249
If Carter had put the poison
in Pauline's glass,

813
00:47:09,542 --> 00:47:10,333
I'd have seen him.

814
00:47:10,625 --> 00:47:12,166
I was next to her.

815
00:47:12,459 --> 00:47:13,249
- Exactement.

816
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:14,833
- So you mean
he didn't kill her.

817
00:47:15,125 --> 00:47:17,874
- It was not I who said
that he did.

818
00:47:19,584 --> 00:47:20,708
Merci.

819
00:47:21,917 --> 00:47:24,541
- Well, if it wasn't Carter,
who was it?

820
00:47:28,292 --> 00:47:29,583
- Who, indeed?

821
00:47:38,209 --> 00:47:40,124
- In Buenos Aires,

822
00:47:40,417 --> 00:47:42,958
who could approach the table
with impunity,

823
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:45,458
invisible in the crowd?

824
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:48,124
Poison a drink,

825
00:47:48,417 --> 00:47:51,124
and at the same time

826
00:47:51,417 --> 00:47:54,541
provide the evidence
of a suicide?

827
00:47:57,042 --> 00:47:59,458
And tonight also,

828
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:03,624
who circled around the table
holding a bottle of champagne?

829
00:48:03,917 --> 00:48:05,374
Only this time,
it was Mademoiselle Pauline

830
00:48:05,667 --> 00:48:07,083
who was to be the victim,

831
00:48:07,375 --> 00:48:10,499
and Monsieur Carter
who was to take the blame.

832
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:17,041
In the dark, when the attention
of everyone is elsewhere,

833
00:48:17,334 --> 00:48:20,458
seen by everyone and yet unseen,

834
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:22,499
the murderer can plant
the evidence

835
00:48:22,792 --> 00:48:24,749
and then vanish again

836
00:48:25,042 --> 00:48:28,416
if he is disguised
as a waiter,

837
00:48:28,709 --> 00:48:30,499
can he not,
Monsieur Russell?

838
00:48:33,334 --> 00:48:35,249
- What are you saying?

839
00:48:35,542 --> 00:48:38,999
Why should I have wanted
to kill Pauline?

840
00:48:39,292 --> 00:48:40,791
- This evening, I learned
that you are the guardian

841
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:42,291
of Mademoiselle Pauline

842
00:48:42,584 --> 00:48:45,708
and that you hold her money
in trust until she is 21.

843
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:46,874
- What of it?

844
00:48:47,167 --> 00:48:49,749
- That time is to be very soon.

845
00:48:50,042 --> 00:48:52,166
I understand that you have also
suffered huge losses

846
00:48:52,459 --> 00:48:54,124
in the Argentine.

847
00:48:54,417 --> 00:48:56,083
I think it will be discovered

848
00:48:56,375 --> 00:48:57,499
that the money
of Mademoiselle Pauline,

849
00:48:57,792 --> 00:49:00,999
it is gone,
and that you have spent it.

850
00:49:04,917 --> 00:49:07,166
- This is ridiculous!

851
00:49:07,459 --> 00:49:08,999
I mean, this waiter business.

852
00:49:09,292 --> 00:49:11,916
Are you really telling me
nobody would've noticed?

853
00:49:14,209 --> 00:49:17,833
- Did you notice the waitress
who served you with coffee

854
00:49:18,125 --> 00:49:21,124
just a few moments ago?

855
00:49:21,417 --> 00:49:22,791
- What?

856
00:49:30,709 --> 00:49:31,749
Pauline.

857
00:49:34,584 --> 00:49:36,083
I don't understand.

858
00:49:36,375 --> 00:49:38,166
- How is it possible?

859
00:49:38,459 --> 00:49:40,291
- Pauline.

860
00:49:41,667 --> 00:49:43,249
I thought I'd lost you.

861
00:49:44,542 --> 00:49:47,249
- Mr. Poirot told me
when he sat next to me.

862
00:49:47,542 --> 00:49:49,916
He said not to touch
the champagne.

863
00:49:50,209 --> 00:49:51,874
I was just to pretend
to drink it

864
00:49:52,167 --> 00:49:54,916
and then pretend
to be dead.

865
00:49:55,209 --> 00:50:00,083
- And you played the part
but to perfection, Mademoiselle.

866
00:50:00,375 --> 00:50:01,416
But tell me,
Mademoiselle Pauline,

867
00:50:01,709 --> 00:50:05,624
it was you, was it not,
who sent me the yellow iris?

868
00:50:05,917 --> 00:50:08,374
- I was very frightened.

869
00:50:08,667 --> 00:50:10,916
I didn't want to believe it,

870
00:50:11,209 --> 00:50:13,208
but I knew.

871
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:16,416
I have always known.

872
00:50:16,709 --> 00:50:19,083
- And so you called
for Poirot.

873
00:50:19,375 --> 00:50:23,458
And Poirot,
he was there.

874
00:50:39,667 --> 00:50:41,083
- Poirot.

875
00:50:41,375 --> 00:50:44,416
- Ah, Hastings.

876
00:50:44,709 --> 00:50:46,624
Mon ami.
- How did it go?

877
00:50:46,917 --> 00:50:48,208
- Well, the case,
it is solved,

878
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,749
and your message, Hastings,
it was most useful.

879
00:50:51,042 --> 00:50:52,874
- Oh.
Good.

880
00:50:53,167 --> 00:50:54,541
- There is just one thing.

881
00:50:54,834 --> 00:50:56,333
- What's that?

882
00:50:56,625 --> 00:50:58,624
- With all this affair,
I have not been able to eat.

883
00:50:58,917 --> 00:51:01,291
- Oh, I say,
that's a bit rough.

884
00:51:01,584 --> 00:51:02,999
Not going to be easy
finding somewhere

885
00:51:03,292 --> 00:51:04,083
at this time of night.

886
00:51:04,375 --> 00:51:05,583
- Oh, that is true.

887
00:51:07,792 --> 00:51:10,541
- I do know one place,
though.

888
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:18,958
English cuisine.

889
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:20,041
There's nothing like it
in the world.

890
00:51:20,334 --> 00:51:22,583
You must agree, Poirot.

891
00:51:22,875 --> 00:51:24,874
- Eh bien, Hastings,
when it is cold and dark,

892
00:51:25,167 --> 00:51:26,833
and there is nothing else
to eat,

893
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:30,041
it is...

894
00:51:30,334 --> 00:51:31,499
passable.
