01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:23,570
[ Men shouting,
train approaching ]

1587
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:26,130
A tight spot, Katherine.

1588
01:34:26,360 --> 01:34:28,806
[ Gasps ]

1589
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,445
[ Rattling ]

1590
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:32,005
But I've known worse.

1591
01:34:32,240 --> 01:34:33,207
POIROT:
Knighton!

1592
01:34:33,320 --> 01:34:34,731
Knighton!

1593
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:37,048
Knighton.
Knighton.

1594
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:38,480
Let her go.

1595
01:34:42,160 --> 01:34:47,883
The greatest jewel thief
in living memory, by all means.

1596
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:52,085
But do not be the mere lunatic.

1597
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:01,811
Sharper than a diamond,
Katherine.

1598
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:04,046
Redder than blood.

1599
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:05,930
[Train approaching]

1600
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:20,368

[ Birds, insects chirping]

1603
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:47,329
M. Poirot.

1604
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:49,443
Mlle. Grey.

1605
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:53,490
Oh, do you leave the Riviera?

1606
01:35:53,680 --> 01:35:55,444
I think it's probably time.

1607
01:35:55,640 --> 01:35:56,926
When do you depart?

1608
01:35:57,160 --> 01:35:59,401
The train doesn't go
until this afternoon.

1609
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:00,840
<i>Et bien.</i>

1610
01:36:01,080 --> 01:36:02,764
<i>Immédiatement, Poirot</i> will <i>go</i>

1611
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,082
and pack his meager possessions
and join you.

1612
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:10,605
Actually, I'm not planning
to go back to London just yet.

1613
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:13,286
It's peculiar, really, given
everything that's happened,

1614
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:15,084
but I've discovered
I rather like travel.

1615
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:16,566
So I'm going to keep going
a bit.

1616
01:36:16,760 --> 01:36:19,161
Oh, but of course.
Oui.

1617
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:20,282
I'm going to go to Vienna.

1618
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:22,005
I'm picking up
the Orient Express.

1619
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:23,884
The idea thrills me.

1620
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:25,969
But I expect you've been on it
millions of times.

1621
01:36:26,160 --> 01:36:27,810
Not once.

1622
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,809
But I must.

1623
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:33,083
You've been so very kind to me,
monsieur.

1624
01:36:34,680 --> 01:36:37,081
You're a very dear man.

1625
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:39,521
A first-class avuncular.
