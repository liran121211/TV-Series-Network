We really must try and broaden
your horizons a little.

4
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,611
Some of these pieces
are terribly revealing.

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,121
For instance,
what do you make of that?

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,689
I-I do not know what to make
of it, Mme. Oliver.

7
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,083
Not symmetrical enough for you?

8
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,369
Oh, look.
It's Mr. Shaitana.

9
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,006
What is he?

10
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,567
An Armenian?
A Greek?

11
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,000
No one knows.

00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,361
All that is known

13
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,166
is that he is one
of the richest men in London.

14
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,640
He gives me the jitters.

15
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,050

M. Shaitana, good day.

19
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,368
How nice to see you.

20
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,281

21
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,164

I am here purely

00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,207
But I see that you yourself
have lent a few pieces.

26
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,569
Oh, one picks up trifles
here and there.

27
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,842
I have a few interesting objects
I could show you.

28
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,364
I daresay I could even produce one
or two things in your line, Poirot.

29

Ah. So you have, then,
your private Black Museum?

Oh, no, no, no.

I collect only the finest
objects of their kind.

34
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,928
And what do you consider to be
the finest objects--

35
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,646
artistically speaking--
in crime?

36
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,083
Why, the human beings
who commit them, monsieur.

37
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,404

POIROT:
I did not realize you accepted

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,364
these kinds of invitation,
madame.

52
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,086
Oh. Well, Mr. Shaitana can be
awfully persuasive.

53
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,520
We met at a literary dinner.

54
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,290
Mrs. Oliver was the guest
of honor.

55
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,841
Oh, yes. It was the Crime

Come to think of it,
what were you doing there?

with Superintendent Wheeler?

POIROT:
Yes. Of course.

00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,446
Please do excuse me.

Nice to see you again, Poirot.

62
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,807
- And you.
- Keeping well?

it's 30 miles wide, you know.

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,611

66
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,964

68
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,888
No, not at all.

69
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,129
I'm rather surprised to be
invited, as a matter of fact.

70
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,970
Do you know him?

71
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,686
I know that he likes
to be different.

72
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,891
Probably went
to the wrong kind of school.

73
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,287
Colonel Hughes.
Excuse us.

74
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,488
Come and meet Major Despard.

75
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,002
I rather think
you've both been on safari.

76
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,490
Now, there's a good boy.

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,920
POIROT:
Do you know anyone here, madame?

78
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,401
No.
I don't know a soul.

79
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,291
But I've made a few inquiries.

80
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,164
<i>- Oui?</i>
- Yes.

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,489

is Anne Meredith.

The dashing major
can't keep his eyes of her.

84
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,206
As a matter of fact,
I've got his book on my shelf.

85
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,561
Oh.
What's it called?

86
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,404
"Amazonian Idyll."

87
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,563
I haven't read it yet,
but I intend to,

88
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,967
because I'm planning to send
Sven up the jungle.

89
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,241
POIROT: Sven?

90
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,088
Sven Hjerson?

91
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,202
My detective.

92
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,202
Ah.

93
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,482
Fictional, of course.

94
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,529
I've no idea who the older lady
is-- Mrs. Lorrimer.

95
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,767
But she and the young one

96
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,328
have been throwing glances at
each other in a most odd manner.

97
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,725
Who's the policeman?

98
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,691
Superintendent Wheeler
of Scotland Yard.

99
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,571
MRS. OLIVER: Bowel trouble.
That would be my guess.

100
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,088
And your friend
from the Foreign Office?

101
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,850
Oh.
That is Colonel Hughes.

102
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,405

00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,290
<i>Je ne sais pas.</i>

104
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,961
MRS. OLIVER: Hmm.

105
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,042
It seems our Mr. Shaitana is
a little bit crime-minded,

106
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,162
shall we say?

107
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,129
He has the most curious taste.

108
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,204
One never knows
what he's going to find amusing.

109
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,683
It might be something... cruel.

110
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,804
You mean, peut-étre,
like the fox hunting?

111
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,968
No, I meant something more...

112
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,846
...Oriental.

113
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,844
SHAITANA:
Dr. Roberts.

114
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,969
Good to see you, Shaitana.
I'm not late, am I?

115
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,605
An elderly patient
called me out.

116
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,962
She thought she had a tumor.
I thought she was depressed.

117
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,207
And what did you prescribe?

118
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,970
Champagne and oysters
at Wilton's.

119
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,366
She'll be right as rain
by tomorrow.

120
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,042
Remind me never to go to him
if I'm poorly.

121
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,480
I imagine, Mrs. Oliver,

122
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,848
that Major Despard would know
a suitable method.

123
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,850
He's spent time under canvas,
after all.

124
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,929
Know any good poisons, Despard?

125
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,849
Well, there's curare, I suppose.

126
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,963
My dear man,
that's terribly old-fashioned.

127
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,527
You must know something
more obscure than that.

128
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,964
I mean something new
and totally untraceable.

129
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,369
DESPARD: Well, the truth is
that primitive tribes

130
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,528
tend not to be conversant
with the latest fashions.

131
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,802
They tend to stick with
what their grandfathers used.

132
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,962
MRS. OLIVER: Oh.

133
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,329
I should have thought they were
always experimenting with herbs

134
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,409
and sap and so forth.

135
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,285
In real life, Mrs. Oliver,
people normally use arsenic

136
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,845
because it's nice and handy.

137
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,007
Oh, drivel.

138
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,771
You're only saying that because
there's a vast amount of crimes

139
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,610
Scotland Yard's
never even heard of.

140
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,564
Now, if you had a woman
in charge--

141
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,727
- A woman?
- And why not?

142
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,887
[ Laughter]

143
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,320
Women know about crime.

144
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,800
As a matter of fact,
that's true.

145
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,207
Women are usually
highly successful criminals.

146
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,249
They keep their heads.
They brazen things out.

147
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,246
Typically a woman's weapon
is poison, is it not, Poirot?

148
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,761
<i>Oui.</i>

149
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,246
<i>Often, oui.</i>

150
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,842
There must be a tremendous
number of women poisoners

151
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,411
who have never been found out.

152
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,522
You're absolutely right.

153
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,491
Of course, a doctor also has
many opportunities of that sort.

154
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,170
Oh, Mr. Shaitana,
I must protest.

155
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,284
When we poison our patients,
it's entirely by accident.

156
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,970
[ Laughter]

157
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,686
If I were to commit a crime,

158
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,247
I should like to keep it
very simple.

159
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,680
An accident, perhaps--

160
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,803
a shooting accident,
for example.

161
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,810
Or a domestic accident.

162
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,884
One of the little tragedies
that never gets reported.

163
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,847
But then who am I to pontificate
with so many experts present?

164
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,761
[Clicking]

165
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,084
It is my passion.

166
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,008
I always take one
of my very special guests.

167
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,009
Are we ready?

168
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,407
The last time I was in Egypt,
I met a friend of yours--

169
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,721
a Mrs. Craddock.

170
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,685
Oh.
You knew poor Mrs. Craddock.

171
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,929
Hurry up, old boy.
I can't keep smiling forever.

172
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,724
Stand still, everyone.

173
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,729
Now, I know
that Mrs. Lorrimer plays.

174
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,730
Do you play bridge,
Miss Meredith?

175
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,405
Yes.
I-I'm not frightfully good.

176
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,522
Major Despard?

177
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,602
Yes, I do.

178
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,602
- Doctor?
- Mm.

179
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,489
Excellent.
Excellent.

180
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,048
Now, supposing you four
sit here.

181
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,369
Drinks are on the sideboard.
Do please help yourselves.

182
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,810
And when we've all enjoyed
our lovely game of cards,

183
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,843
I shall have a rather special
announcement to make.

184
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,201
Are you getting married?

185
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,845
No.

186
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,007
It's a secret.

187
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,886
Oh.
I do love a secret.

188
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,050
[ Indistinct conversations ]

189
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,409
And <i>this</i> is for you.

190
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,607
Ah.
Well, one of us must drop out.

191
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,609
Oh, no, no. I don't play.
I never have.

192
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,521
I do not find it
sufficiently thrilling.

193
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,006
WHEELER:
One heart.

194
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,611
POIROT: Pass.

195
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,249
HUGHES:
Three clubs.

196
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,363
Three spades.

197
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,210
WHEELER:
Four hearts.

198
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,291
POIROT:
Doubled.

199
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,323
HUGHES:
No bid.

200
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,164
MRS. OLIVER:
Pass.

201
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,330
Four hearts, then.
Doubled.

202
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,607
So I'm dummy?

203
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,529
<i>Oui.</i>

204
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,648
Thank you very much, partner.

205
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,529
It's jolly curious.

206
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,841
Here are the four of us.

207
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,841
And we're all, well, for want
of a better word, sleuths.

208
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,522
So who are those four in there?

209
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,122
Criminals?

210
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,407
They don't look like criminals.

211
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,766
WHEELER: Most criminals
don't look like criminals,

212
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,610
Mrs. Oliver.

213
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,089
One, no trump.

214
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,567
DR. ROBERTS:
Three hearts.

215
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,922
No bid.

216
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,804
Four hearts.

217
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,530
MRS. LORRIMER: Doubled.

218
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,682
DR. ROBERTS: Pass.

219
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,765
Pass.

220
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,963
HUGHES:
Three clubs.

221
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,650
MRS. OLIVER:
Three spades.

222
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,683
WHEELER:
Doubled.

223
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,325
One heart.

224
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,006
Pass.

225
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,445
HUGHES: Five diamonds.
Game and rubber.

226
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,369
Good for you, partner.

227
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,722
It's 10 past 12:00.
Time for another?

228
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,241
No, no, no. I'm a family man.
You'll have to excuse me.

229
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,010
Oh.
I also must go.

230
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,604
Well, I'm afraid, Mrs. Oliver,
we're all up and you're down.

231
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,643
All I did was follow
my instincts.

232
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,924
I don't know what went wrong
tonight.

233
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,128
How much is it?

234
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,044
Got to be going, Shaitana.

235
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,601
DR. ROBERTS:
Three clubs.

236
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,406
MRS. LORRIMER:
Double three clubs.

237
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,762
ANNE:
Three. No trumps.

238
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,801
DESPARD: Double three.
No trumps.

239
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,202
I'm damned
if he hasn't fallen asleep.

240
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,368
Mr. Shaitana?

241
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,088
I say.
Poirot?

242
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,284
Colonel Hughes?

243
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,729
- HUGHES: My God.
- WHEELER: Ladies and gentlemen,

244
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,685
could I have your attention
for a moment?

245
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,124
I'm very sorry to have to inform
you that Mr. Shaitana...

246
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,685
is dead.

247
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,162
Dead?

248
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,203
Are you sure?
Let me check the man's pulse.

249
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,521
Dr. Roberts,
please stay where you are.

250
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,210
Let me have a look at him.
He may just have fainted.

251
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,090
He hasn't fainted.

252
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,481
He's been murdered.

253
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,364
Murdered?

254
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,847
Stabbed through the heart.

255
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,210
SHAITANA:
Why should I be interested

256
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,765
in the murderer who is caught?

257
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,209
He's a poor specimen--
a failure by definition.

258
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,289
No.
For me, only the best.

259
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,527
And the best, it is?

260
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,809
My dear fellow,
the ones who get away with it.

261
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,004
<i>A, ce n'est pas amusant.</i>

262
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,240
Have I shocked
your bourgeois sensibilities?

263
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,290
It is true I have a thoroughly
bourgeois attitude to murder.

264
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,887
But a murderer can be
an <i>artiste, non?</i>

265
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,570
<i>Mais oui.</i>

266
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,603
But he's still a murderer.

267
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,531
Ah, Poirot.

268
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,449
I understand.

269
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,483
You must adopt this mentality

270
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,889
because if the murderer
gets away with it,

271
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,726
where does that leave you?

272
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,008
WHEELER:
So no butler and no servants.

273
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,167
HUGHES: No.

274
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,489
No one came in,
and no one went out.

275
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,920
WHEELER:
Well, we're agreed, then.

276
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,327
One of that card party
must have killed him.

277
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,921
One of those people, a murderer?
Impossible.

278
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,009
HUGHES:
What do you think, Poirot?

279
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,247
Well, I think this murder,
it was not planned.

280
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,849
I think Shaitana says something
or does something

281
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,168
which causes someone to panic.

282
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,450
Now, he said he was going to
reveal a secret.

283
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,847
So somebody gets the wind up,
and then...

284
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,883
If I were you,
I'd arrest that doctor at once.

285
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,407
Soon as I saw him, my instinct
told me he was a bad 'un.

286
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,921
If we had a woman at the head of
Scotland Yard, I daresay we would.

287
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,241
But because we only have men,

288
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,489
we sort of have to arrive rather
more slowly at our destination.

289
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,206
Right.
Let's get them in.

290
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,322
Mrs. Oliver?

291
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,686
Oh, please, may I stay?

292
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,689
No, no, no. That would be
irregular, Mrs. Oliver.

293
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,565
But I lost three pounds,
seven shillings at bridge,

294
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,922
right next door to a murder.

295
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,481
Oh, please.

296
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,682
WHEELER:
No interruptions. Right?

297
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,924
- O'Connor?
- Sir?

298
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,525
Send in Dr. Roberts.

299
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,404
Sir.

300
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,767
I'd have kept him till last.

301
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,930
Sorry.
Sorry.

302
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,485
In a book, I mean.

303
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,489
Real life is a little different.

304
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,570
Yes.
Badly constructed.

305
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,204
Well, Shaitana amused me.

306
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,721
He was such a bizarre fellow,
wasn't he?

307
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,048
But I had no reason
for killing him,

308
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,242
and I didn't kill him.

309
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:12,286
Dr. Roberts,
tax your memory carefully

310
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,488
and tell me how many times
you left your seat

311
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,806
at the bridge table.

312
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,651
Well, we began to play at 9:30,
didn't we?

313
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:22,606
About an hour later,
I stoked the fire.

314
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,610
A short time after that,
I brought drinks for the ladies.

315
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,849
And then, about half past 11:00,
I should say,

316
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,481
I-I got up again to make myself
a whiskey and soda.

317
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,921
WHEELER: And Shaitana, to the
best of your belief, was asleep?

318
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:34,959
Yes.

319
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,770
You couldn't see him clearly
from your table?

320
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,207
Look, when you're playing
bridge, you're playing bridge.

321
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,801
You're not peering around,
noticing what's going on.

322
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,082
The only person who might be
doing that is dummy.

323
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:50,525
Dr. Roberts... just give me
your opinion, man to man.

324
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,004
Who did it?

325
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,486
Well, it doesn't
seem to me likely

326
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,920
that the women are in on it.

327
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,208
But that Despard,
he'd take a risk.

328
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,442
And it was a hell of a risk,
wasn't it?

329
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,086
WHEELER:
Look, um...

330
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,322
Go ahead.

331
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,731
It's, uh,
it's been fingerprinted.

332
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,490
There's nothing.

333
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,523
What a tool.

334
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,451
Absolutely made for murder.

335
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,761
Go in like butter, that would.
Whose was it?

336
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,525
It was Shaitana's.

337
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,290
It lay on the table by the door.

338
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,767
SHAITANA:
Stand still, everyone.

339
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,491
Dr. Roberts, do you have
a regular bridge partner?

340
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,722
No.
I-I'm not that serious about it.

341
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,842
But I like the game.

342
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,168
May I ask of you
for your opinion

343
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,443
of your companions tonight--
as card players?

344
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,483
Well, Mrs. Lorrimer
is first class.

345
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,648
I bet she makes a tidy income
out of bridge.

346
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:45,129
Despard's a good player, too--
what I'd call a sound player.

347
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,442
Long-headed chap.

348
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,928
Miss Meredith you might describe
as safe.

349
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,640
She's not brilliant,
but she doesn't make mistakes.

350
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,524
And of you yourself?

351
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,608
Well, I overcall my hand a bit,
or so they say,

352
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,525
but I've--
I've always found it pays.

353
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,610
Especially where the ladies
are concerned.

354
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,766
I got up only once,
when I was dummy.

355
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,283
I went to the fire.

356
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,729
Mr. Shaitana was still alive
then.

357
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,841
Dr. Roberts poured me a drink.

358
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:24,010
He also poured himself one
later.

359
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:29,368
Major Despard also went
to fetch a drink.

360
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,450
Yes, the men moved about
a good deal.

361
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,723
Um, I wasn't really paying
much attention.

362
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,764
Miss Meredith didn't leave
her seat at all.

363
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,331
She didn't get up once?

364
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,402
Sounds unlikely.

365
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,403
Superintendent Wheeler,
I quite realize

366
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,967
that one of the four people
in that room must be guilty.

367
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,130
Naturally, I don't expect you
to simply take my word

368
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,287
that I am not that person.

369
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,721
But you will kindly not imply
that I tell lies.

370
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,885
Did you know Shaitana well?

371
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:03,722
Yes. I-I'd known Mr. Shaitana
for some time.

372
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,400
I met him in Egypt
at the Mena Palace Hotel.

373
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,046
May I?
It is my hobby.

374
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,802
Oh.

375
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,090
I thought him--
Well, I may as well say it.

376
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,090
A charlatan.

377
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,486
[ Shutter clicks]

378
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,409
I thought him a poseur

379
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,206
and rather theatrical
and irritating.

380
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,449
But-- But I'd no motive
to wish him out of the way.

381
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,130
It's really a matter
of indifference to me

382
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,322
whether he's alive or dead.

383
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:36,447
Will you take a look at this,
please, Mrs. Lorrimer?

384
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,405
It's a stiletto.

385
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,201
Now, I hope you realize
that with a weapon like that,

386
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,011
a woman could do the trick
just as easily as a man.

387
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,405
Yes, I'm sure she could.

388
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,046
Which of the other people

389
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,645
do you consider to be
the most likely?

390
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,161
Superintendent,
that is an improper question,

391
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,091
and I have no intention
of answering it.

392
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,769
We've been through the place
thoroughly.

393
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,525
Can't find anything at all.

394
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,371
But I'll get that photograph
developed, sir, shall I?

395
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,482
Yes.

396
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,881
[Clock chiming]

397
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,848
What's the idea, Poirot?

398
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,201
Mm, that there may be something

399
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,129
in the way that the players kept
the scores.

400
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,287
Mm.

401
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,850
Now, this is the first rubber.

402
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,929
And you'll notice that
the figures are neat and small,

403
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,602
and it is that
of Mlle. Anne Meredith.

404
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,570
Now, the next--

405
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,285
Now, this score is not so easy
to follow

406
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,041
because is it kept in the style
of cancellation.

407
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,926
But it does tell us something
about Major Despard,

408
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,681
a man who likes to know all
of the time where he stands.

409
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,971
Oh, by the way, Superintendent,
I could not help but notice

410
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,482
that in the bottom of the glass
belonging to M. Shaitana,

411
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,245
there is a little residue.

412
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,807
WHEELER:
Hmm. O'Connor?

413
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,400
Now, this next rubber--

414
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,002
Ah, this is--
this is done by Mme. Lorrimer.

415
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,929
You will notice
that her handwriting is graceful

416
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,042
but firm.

417
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,600
And it is she and Dr. Roberts
against the other two.

418
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,211
There's definitely
something there, sir.

419
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,481
Can't tell what it is.

420
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,330
Well, let's get it analyzed,
then.

421
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,330
And regardez--
1,500 points in one hand.

422
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,204
<i>C'est formidable, huh?</i>

423
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,801
Now, this is
the unfinished rubber.

424
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,241
You will notice that the scores,
they are much lower,

425
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,887
because now the Dr. Roberts,
he is partnering Mlle. Meredith.

426
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,486
<i>And she is</i> a <i>player most timid,
n'est-ce pas?</i>

427
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,845
I live at Wendon Cottage,
Wallingford.

428
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,281
So, how well did you know
Mr. Shaitana?

429
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,928
I didn't know him well at all.

430
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,126
I thought him
a most frightening man.

431
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,681
That awful smile.

432
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,451
And he'd a way
of bending over you

433
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,529
as if he intended to bite you.

434
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,690
WHEELER:
Yes. Where did you meet?

435
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,486
We met in Switzerland
during the winter sports

436
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,602
about nine months ago.

437
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,682
SHAITANA: Hello.

438
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,206
ANNE: He cut marvelous figures
on the ice.

439
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,210
I don't suppose you'd care
to come to an aprés-ski?

440
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,446
ANNE:
They were fun... the parties.

441
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,085
And he wasn't?

442
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,962
He's a shivery kind of chap.

443
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:23,167
Now, then, um,
about tonight, my dear.

444
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,681
Did you leave your seat at all?

445
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,882
I don't think so.

446
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,920
I-I may have done once.

447
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,930
I-I looked
at the other players' hands.

448
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,726
- So you left your seat once?
- Yes.

449
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,851
But you stayed by the table?

450
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,919
Yes.

451
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,967
All the time?

452
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,122
No. No.

453
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,202
No.
I-I...

454
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,570
I think I walked about.

455
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,129
WHEELER:
You walked about?

456
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,647
To the fire, perhaps?

457
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,405
No.

00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,329
No, I-I didn't.

I know that you're nervous,

463
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,322
but you really must try
and tell me the truth.

All right?

465
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,450

Did you walk in the direction
of Mr. Shaitana?

00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,361
- When he was by the fire?
- Yes.

469
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,721
- No.
- Are you quite sure?

00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,571
I honestly don't remember.
Honestly.

471
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,128
So who do you think killed him?

472
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,402
I can't believe anyone did.

473
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,090
Someone did, mademoiselle.

474
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,650

He invited them here

to be a murderer.

877
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:23,570
that to you every incident is as
clear as if it was yesterday.

878

ANNE:
My father was a stockbroker.

881
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,484
He died when I was 15.

882
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,727
He left no money.

883
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,207
I found a job looking after
three small boys.

884
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,450
A Mrs. Eldon, the Larches,
Ventnor, Isle of Wight.

885
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:56,528
After two years,
the Eldons moved overseas.

886
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,564
I went to a Mrs. Deering
in Devon.

887
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,441
So, um...

how do you two know
each other?

889

Rhoda and I were at school
together.

Oh, I see.

891
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,246
And then what?

892
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,886
Poor Mrs. Deering became infirm.

893
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,600
She had to go to a sanatorium.

894
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,450
Rhoda was looking about
for a cottage.

895
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,041
I wanted someone to share with.

896
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,526
Anne was perfect.

897
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,805
I say, Anne.

898
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,287
You didn't mention
the Crossways.

900
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,971
I didn't think it counted.

901
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,083

I had a good poke around,

903
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:50,289
but I didn't see anything
too suspicious.

904
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:54,168
Yet, to tell the truth,

905
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:57,284
there's something rather off
about their relationship.

906
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:01,769
Now, the Rhoda girl,
she's the one with the money.

907
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,924
Yet I would say she's jealous
of Anne.

908
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,407
Anne's the one
with the admirers.

909
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:12,166
There were, I think,
some photographs of her father,

910
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:15,364
but absolutely none
of her mother.

911

For myself,
the only information that I have

916
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,885

a decent editor.

of a hand at that sort of thing.

937
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,363
But to my mind,
it was a rotten sort of a room.

938
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,324

There's only one game

a crime of impulse?

in inviting these people
to his house?

1062

He was strange, this Shaitana.

always he is there, in Egypt.

1070

Perhaps he was Egyptian.

1071

No.
He was Syrian.

Don't take this out of context,

1085
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:15,489
but Despard led a trip into
the South American interior,

1086
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:19,287
accompanying
a Professor Luxmore.

1087

Oh, yes.
He writes about it in his book.

1088
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,085
It's very purple prose.

1089
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:26,726
Does he write that the professor
died of a fever

1090
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,042
and was buried
somewhere up the Amazon?

1091
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,810
Yes.
He glances over it.

1092
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,923
Mm.

1093
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:37,330
Well, there's a rumor going
about that the old boy was shot.

1094

By Despard, in the back.

1095

I lay odds
against it being true.

1096

Incapable of what
I would call murder, yes.

Shaitana was a louse.

Shaitana may have come across
something about Luxmore's death.

is an observer who is most keen.

to a Mrs. Deering.

Mademoiselle, could you tell
to me more about Mme. Craddock?

He was here
in Harley Street then.

He never set foot in Egypt.
He doesn't like the food.

But Mme. Craddock--
Did she need many inoculations

1232
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,401
Well, of course.

1233

01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:34,843

or Mrs. Lorrimer.

1364
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:37,008
Mrs. Organized, I should say.

1365
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,964
Mm.
Perhaps this is true.

Ah. Mrs. Oliver.
I hope you don't mind.

1369
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:47,608
I was told
that M. Poirot was here.

01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,723
- Superintendent, you're welcome.
- Thank you.

1371

Well, um, I've been down
to Devonshire.

And you were right.

1374
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:00,481
Anne Meredith worked
for a Mrs. Benson

1375

at a house called Crossways
near Dawlish.

1376
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:07,281

was Rhoda Dawes' aunt.

Every night,
she'd take syrup of figs.

1378
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:11,844
But there was some silver polish
in a bottle

1379
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:14,202
which Anne Meredith broke.

1380
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:20,486
ANNE:
I'm sorry, Mrs. Benson.

1381
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:22,091
Look. There--

1382
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:24,282
There's still some left.

1383
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:27,285
I think there's an empty bottle
in the cupboard.

1384
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:31,289
WHEELER: Now, the police believe
it was an accident.

1385
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:34,609
Even the old lady herself
believed it was an accident.

1386
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:37,451
But somebody put that bottle
into the bathroom,

1387
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:40,484
and the housemaid swears
it wasn't her.

1388
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:41,602
So I'm afraid I believe

1389
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:45,321
Anne Meredith deliberately
murdered her employer.

01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:49,851
What I do not know is why.

1391
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:52,247

This afternoon,
I made a little experiment.

01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:04,964
I invited Anne Meredith
to my apartment

1396

and asked her
the usual questions

1397
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:09,529
about what she can remember
from the room of Shaitana.

1398
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:12,449
She's suspicious, huh?

1399
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:15,484
Very suspicious.

1400
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,207
So the cunning dog,
he does one of his best tricks.

1401
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:20,926
He lays the little trap.

the case of jewelry.

1403

of the room from the table

But mademoiselle,
she does not fall into the trap.

But then she begins to make
the mistake to relax a little.

Because I saw her.

1565
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:56,725
It was late in the game.

1566
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:00,127
Anne was dummy.

1567
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:05,644
I looked over
to the fireplace...

1568
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:14,006
...and I saw her
push the knife in.

1569
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:23,524
It was Anne.

Oh.
Has he?

what happened
at my Aunt Benson's, Annie.

1575
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:39,884
I feel sure it'd be better
to mention it,

1576
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:42,651
because if something
does come out,

1577
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:44,126
it might look rather bad.

she did not want you to be sent

I think you know we have not,

And it was not Anne Meredith.

She did not push in the knife.

This had already been done.

has pushed in the knife.

she is frightened to death.

Well, then,
who did do it, Poirot?

1665
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:01,166
Perhaps it was the person

1666
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:03,408
who broke into the house
of Shaitana.

01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:06,046

for something.

I swear it.

1674
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:22,565
You have the motive.

01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:25,161
You have the opportunity.

1676
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:28,011
But do you have the character?

1677
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:32,490
This I do not know.

1678
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:42,651
I have asked you all here
to help me to conclude the game.

1679
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:50,603
See, everyone tells to me
that M. Shaitana, he was asleep.

1680
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:52,407
But then I ask myself,

1681
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:56,366
why should a man sleep
at his own party?

1682
01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:59,646
And then, of course,
we learn that he was drugged.

1683
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:02,127
But who has drugged him?

1684
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:04,004
The answer?

1686
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:10,049
No one.
Because he has drugged himself.

1687
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:13,446
Which is why there were only
his fingerprints--

1688
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:15,881

1690
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:21,004
That's a bit far-fetched,
Poirot.

1691
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:24,885
Ah, but I know
that he has drugged himself.

1692
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:27,370
He told me so.

1693
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:30,450
It is as close as one gets
to heaven.

1694
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:34,042
A dive into the infinite,
the ecstatic moment of oblivion.

1695
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:37,011
POIROT:
Shaitana creates the crime,

1696
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:39,481
and then he helped me
to solve it.

1697
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:43,162
He has drugged himself
because he wanted to be killed.

1698
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:45,842
That was the game.

1699
01:26:46,680 --> 01:26:50,321
To die and to make fools
of the police.

1700
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:54,400
I ask of everyone what they can
remember from his room

1701
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:57,171
because this gives me the key
to the character, huh?

1702
01:26:57,360 --> 01:26:59,442
And with this key,
I unlock the door.

1703
01:26:59,680 --> 01:27:03,127
I open it, I enter in,
and what do I discover?

1704

I discover that the murderer
of M. Shaitana,

01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:11,925
it was not Mme. Lorrimer, <i>non.</i>

1706
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:17,610
It was not Major Despard, <i>non.</i>

And it was not you,

01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:38,851
It was you, Dr. Roberts.

1710
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:40,724
You killed him.

01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:43,971
- Are you mad, Poirot?
<i>- Non.</i>

1712
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:49,121
It was you, and only you, who
could possibly have killed him.

1713
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:51,721
For the reasons of psychology.

1714
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:56,320
You made the call
of the grand slam.

1715
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:58,921
And the bid of the grand slam,
it is most exciting,

1716
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:00,082
<i>n'est-ce pas?</i>

1717
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:01,810
To take all the tricks
on the table.

1718
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,240
So now the players,

1719
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:06,250
they play with an attention
which is rapt.

1720
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:08,283
But who is dummy?

1721
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:12,371
And I soon discovered it was,
of course, you, Dr. Roberts.

1722
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:14,449
And for a man
who is usually so observant,

1723
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:16,563
you could remember
strangely little of your game,

1724
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:20,122
suggesting that your mind,
it was on something else.

1725
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:22,722
But, of course, this would not
be an easy matter to prove.

1726
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:24,046
Nor would it be easy to prove

1727
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:26,527
that you also killed
Mme. Craddock.

1728
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:30,131
I know a good psychiatrist.

1729
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:32,004
Shall I book you in?

1730
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:38,527
You killed Mme. Craddock
because she had discovered

1731
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:40,370
that you were in a relationship
with her husband

1732
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:41,482
that was sexual.

1733
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:43,926
You still are.

He visits with you
two or three times a week.

1735
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:50,561
Because he is
your regular bridge partner.
