00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,162
But unfortunately,
we can't ask her to explain.

178
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,328
You see, yesterday afternoon,

179
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,603
Cora was hacked to death
by an intruder with a hatchet.

180
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,927
The doctor puts the murder
in the afternoon,

181
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,289
no later than 4:30,
probably much nearer 2:00.

182
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,403
Somebody smashed
the kitchen window

183
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,887
and attacked Mrs. Gallaccio
in her bed.

184
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,969
A particularly brutal attack,
as you saw.

185
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,606
Six or seven blows were struck.

186
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,002
She was in her bed
during the daytime?

187
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,043
She'd slept badly.

188
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,322
She sent the companion
into Reading

189
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,721
to exchange some library books

190
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,365
and took a couple
of sleeping pills.

191
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,681
So she'd have been drowsy

192
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,644
if not already asleep
when they broke in.

193
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:48,129
So a hatchet seems, well,
excessive, to say the least.

194
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,001
I suppose the companion
could have done it.

195
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,004
Two women living together alone.

196
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,891
You never know what quarrels
and resentments build up.

197
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,406
But by all accounts,
they got on well.

198
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,329
And was anything stolen,
Inspector?

199
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,045
Just a few bits and pieces
of jewelry.

200
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,162
Nothing of any value.

201
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,651
And they could have taken
whatever they wanted.

202
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,889
And this is the odd thing.

203
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,368
We found them shoved in a hedge
not far from the cottage.

204
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,406
I suppose the murderer
may have had a sudden panic

205
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,806
or a fit of remorse.

206
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,050
But in my experience
of criminals, it's unusual.

207
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,403
So, with your permission
of course, Inspector,

208
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,881
I would like to pay a visit
to this companion.

209
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,241
Oh, please do.

210
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,891
She's a sensible enough woman.

211
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,809
Let me know if she says
anything new.

212
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,128
<i>Oui. Merci.</i>

213
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,282
ENTWHISTLE: And then,
on top of everything else,

214
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,970
I discovered there was
a break-in at the office

215
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,201
on the day of the funeral.

216
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,890
The Enderby deeds are missing,

217
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,282
and I haven't had a chance
to attend to it.

218
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,970
But if the deeds are missing...

219
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,082
The house can't be sold

220
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,003
and the family can't get
their share of the money.

221
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,362
A break-in
on the day of the funeral.

222
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,369
The deeds of the house
go missing.

223
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,289
This is indeed
a big coincidence,

224
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,402
<i>n'est-ce pas, monsieur?</i>

225
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,811
Yes, I suppose it is.

226
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,047
Listen, Poirot.

227
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,288
You <i>will</i> take the case on,
won't you?

228
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,245
It would be a great favor to me
if you did.

229
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,200
<i>Oui, monsieur.</i>
I will <i>take the</i> case.

230
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,011
MISS GILCHRIST: The inspector
assures me she didn't suffer.

231
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,601
The first blow
would have killed her.

232
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,041
Oh, dear, I do hope so.

233
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,011
I'm so glad you've come,
Mr. Entwhistle.

234
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,162
Mr. Poirot.

235
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,202
Mademoiselle.

236
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,926
I don't know Mrs. Gallaccio's
family.

237
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,243
I'm rather nervous
about meeting them.

238
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,643
Mrs. Gallaccio bought them
at sales.

239
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,245
She always thought
there was a chance

240
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,408
of picking up something
worthwhile.

241
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,605
They're Mrs. Gallaccio's
own paintings.

242
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,801
They're very good, aren't they?

243
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,490
<i>Oui.</i>

244
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,647
Of course,
I don't know enough to judge,

245
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,490
although my father was
a painter.

246
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,088
Not a very successful one,
unfortunately.

247
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,041
But Mrs. Gallaccio knew a great
deal about artistic things,

248
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,526
poorsouL

249
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,927
[Sniffs]
Ah.

250
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,485
It is the oil paint.

251
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,602
Yes.

252
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,121
She liked to paint in here.

253
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,490
And you got on well with
your employer, mademoiselle?

254
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,642
Oh, yes.

255
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,406
In some ways,
she was rather like a child.

256
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,369
She was not an intellectual.

257
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,921
MISS GILCHRIST:
Perhaps more of an instinctive.

258
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,849
But she was very shrewd,
Mr. Entwhistle.

259
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,010
It quite surprised me sometimes

260
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,441
how she hit the nail
on the head.

261
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,166
And you had been with her
for a long time, huh?

262
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,850
- Three and a half years.
- Ah.

263
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,568
You acted as companion
and, uh, looked after the house?

264
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,331
I did the cooking
and light dusting.

265
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,010
None of the rough.

266
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,568
Mrs. Panter from the village
came in for that.

267
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,770
I don't think of myself
as a servant, Mr. Entwhistle.

268
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,486
I would very much like to see
the bedroom of Mme. Gallaccio--

269
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,007
if that is convenient.

270
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,247
[Hinges squeak]

271
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,761
Inspector Morton said
it was all right to clean

272
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,530
after the police had finished.

273
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,087
I haven't touched
her personal things, of course.

274
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,520
<i>Bon.</i>

275
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,130
Did Cora talk
about her brother's funeral?

276
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,847
She said the chapel was filled
with flowers.

277
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,163
She was very sorry not to see
her other brother-- Timothy?

278
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,328
ENTWHISTLE:
Timothy, yes.

279
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,970
Oh.

280
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,165
<i>C'est très délicieux.</i>

281
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,042
These scones,
they are made by you?

282
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,129
I've always had a hand
with cakes.

283
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,802
Oh, dear.
That sounds as if I'm boasting.

284
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,525
No, no, no.
Not at all.

285
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,326
You do not boast, mademoiselle.

286
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,171
Tell to me, if you please--

287
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,849
How was Mme. Gallaccio when she
returned from the funeral?

288
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,962
The night she got back,

289
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,686
she was happier
than I'd seen her for some time.

290
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,087
She asked me if I'd like to go
to South America.

291
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,567
I said it would be a thing
to dream about.

292
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,250
And she said, "We'll go."

293
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,285
Just like that.

294
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,324
I guessed her brother had
decided to leave her some money

295
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,726
after his visit here.

296
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,441
He came down here?

297
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,204
Yes.
About three weeks ago.

298
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,004
It was a surprise
for Mrs. Gallaccio.

299
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,010
She hadn't seen him
since before her marriage.

300
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,604
I-It quite upset her...

301
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,930
...realizing he was so ill.

302
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,090
He told Cora he was ill?

303
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,805
Yes.

304
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,728
It reminded me
of an old aunt of mine.

305
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,809
I wondered
if he might be suffering

306
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,804
from some softening
of the brain.

307
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,042
Why did you think this?

308
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,248
Mrs. Gallaccio said
he'd started to get ideas

309
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,885
that someone was trying to
poison him.

310
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,002
What?

311
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,809
Please go on, mademoiselle.

312
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,251
She dismissed it, of course.

313
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,767
Old people get fancies
like that, don't they?

SUSANNAH: Imagine
the desperation of the people

316
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,523
when the rain doesn't come
and the crop fails.

317
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,610
It's hard for us here in England
to believe there is poverty

318
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,121
and hunger in the empire.

319
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,331
Our vision of Africa is one
of exoticism and adventure.

320
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,922
But the mission at Kasane
is a hand-to-mouth affair.

321
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,401
Most of the children there
cannot read or write.

322
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,568
They have no means
of improving their lives

323
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,081
so they may escape from poverty
in the future.

324
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,170
These children need a school.

325
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,206
Our mission in Bechuanaland
is to bring education

326
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,167
and, above all, hope
to the people living there.

327
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,611
I hope you will all give
as generously as you can.

328
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,961

in mission work.

It seems a burglar
broke into her cottage

the day after the funeral.

339
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,371
He stole some jewelry,
and he killed her.

Oh, no.

341
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,289
Well, she must have good nerves
to stay in there on her own.

342
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,000
I suspect it is
that she has nowhere to go

00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,809
who he thought was trying to
poison him?

352
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,764
Perhaps.

353
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,211
Cora Gallaccio announces that
her brother has been murdered,

354
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,689
and then the very next day
she is killed most brutally.

355
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,884
Well, let us suppose
that she was speaking the truth

356
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,971
and that your friend Richard
Abernethie was indeed poisoned.

357
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,728
Who benefited from the death
of Richard?

358
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,161
The whole family.
Apart from George, of course.

359
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,805
And myself, to a small degree.

360
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,729
Ah.
So you yourself are a suspect?

361
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,649
- Now, look here, Poirot.
<i>- Non, non, non, monsieur.</i>

362
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,763
<i>Je fais une blague.</i>
I make a joke, huh?

363
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,843
[ Chuckles ]

364
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,321
Monsieur, we shall go
to see the family.

365
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,726
And we shall tell to them

366
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,088
that I investigate
the death of Cora only.

367
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,523
That way, we may be able
to catch them off their guard.

368
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,081
It is necessary
that I ascertain the whereabouts

369
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,089
of each and every member
of that family

370
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,886
on the day after the funeral.

371
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,049
MAN: You're entering
just a tad early, my sweet.

372
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,287
MISS SORREL:
So I <i>don't</i> enter

373
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,522
on "And now he says he's
going to show her the evidence"?

374
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,642
No. No. No.

375
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,529
Darling, you enter
on "She despises him."

376
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,165
And you don't sit down
immediately.

377
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,401
You just keep standing...

378
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,207
How exciting.
You're most frightfully famous.

379
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,290
You read people's minds--
psychology sort of thing.

380
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,402
<i>Mais, d'accord.</i>

381
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,011
It is the "why" of human
behavior that interests me.

382
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,440
I'd like to murder
that director.

383
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,086
MAN:
Miss Sorrel, do come back!

384
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,770
My apologies, madame,

385
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,367
for intruding at this time
so sensitive.

386
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,324
It is unfortunate, is it not,

387
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,729
to lose two members of one's
family so closely together?

388
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,729
It is, isn't it?

389
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,968
Although I can't think
why anyone would want to murder

390
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,730
someone like Aunt Cora.

391
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,570
It would appear
that it was a burglar

392
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,730
who broke in to steal
some of her possessions.

393
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,041
Please do forgive me,

394
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,129
but it is necessary
that I ask of you both

395
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,522
where you were
on the day after the funeral.

396
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,560
We were at home till 11:00.

397
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,366
Then you left to have lunch
with Oscar.

398
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,166
I was to meet my friend Jane,
but we missed each other.

399
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,805
So I had a lovely day shopping.

400
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:51,284
We dined after the show and got
back to the flat about midnight.

401
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,083
You do not feel well, madame?

402
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,327
[Sighs]

403
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,170
First-night nerves.

404
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,441
I'm always queasy,

405
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,889
especially when it's absolute
rubbish, like this one.

406
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,325
I must say,
it's the most marvelous luck,

407
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,246
Uncle Richard leaving us
all this lovely money just now.

408
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,370
It means that we can produce
our own plays.

409
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,167
Um, we've got the chance of an
option on a rather good piece.

410
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:20,600
Terrific lead for me and a...
a good part for Rosamund.

411
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,643
It will make Michael's career.

412
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,285
Larry Olivier
had better watch out.

413
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,244
I'm afraid
there's a bit of a delay

414
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,488
with some of the documents
for the house.

415
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,444
The money won't be available
immediately.

416
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,971
But we can get an advance.

417
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,529
Michael said we could.

418
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,687
It's terribly important.

419
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,410
There's no real hurry, sir.

420
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,206
It's just a question of whether
or not to take up the option.

421
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,001
MAN:
Michael?

422
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,726
Excuse me.
I-I think I'm on.

423
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,211
Did Aunt Cora leave any money?

424
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,721
She left what she had
to your sister.

425
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,246
Well, why Susannah,
I'd like to know.

MAN: Michael,
if you would be so kind.

427
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,044
But she hardly knew me.

428
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,521
And there's her share
of the estate, of course.

429
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,281
Well... it all helps.

430
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,050
If you please to forgive me,

431
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,689
it is necessary that I ask of
you both as to your whereabouts

432
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,127
on the day after the funeral
of Richard Abernethie.

433
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,651
Helen was at Enderby.

434
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,486
I asked her to stay on to look
through Richard's things.

435

Thank you, Gilbert.

436
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,961
He asked me
on the day of the funeral.

437
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,650
And I was beastly to you
in return.

438
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,490
Oh, please, Helen.
It's quite forgotten.

439

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,969
I'm perfectly all right, Mother.
Why do you ask?

ENTWHISTLE:
George, this is Hercule Poirot.

I've asked him to look into the
circumstances.

I had no idea
you had such famous friends.

- Monsieur.

I got the feeling she was just
about to kick over the traces.

Don't be flippant about her,
George.

455

ENTWHISTLE: I tried to reach you
the day after the funeral

456

to see if everything
was all right,

457
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,887
and I couldn't get hold of you.

458
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,481
Yes. I went to the races
at Hurst Park.

459
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,569
Had two winners,
as a matter of fact.

460
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,402
And your whereabouts,
mademoiselle?

461
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,009
I went to the P&O shipping line

462
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,964
to inquire about traveling
to Africa.

463
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,610
You're going to Africa?

464
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,088
Yes.
As soon as I can get a passage.

00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,764
Monsieur, tell to me,
if you please,

467

the two horses on which you won
some money.

468
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,931
What were their names?

469
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,447
Gaymarck and Isambard II.

470
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,886
Ah.

When was the last time you saw
Cora Gallaccio, madame?

473
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,684
Oh, I hadn't seen Cora
since our wedding.

474
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,969

"Your youngest sister
is completely batty,"

476
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,286
but I'm afraid
that's what I thought.

477
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,930
And she had this strange habit
of putting her head on one side.

478
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,564
Rather like a bird.

479
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,644
Very odd.

480
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,243
Very odd.

Good of you to come, Entwhistle.

I, uh, I mustn't exert myself.
It's doctor's orders.

488
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,088
Well, I can hardly believe it.

489
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,568
Poor little Cora,
killed with a hatchet.

490
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,889
What's the damned country
coming to, I'd like to know.

491
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,128
Mr. Poirot is looking into
Cora's death.

492
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,287
Oh.

493
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,404
I don't know what we want
a private detective for.

494
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,887
My commiserations,
M. Abernethie.

495
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,560
It is a time most difficult
for the family, huh?

496
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,001
I understand that your brother,
he also died recently.

497
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,010
This is what happens when you
get into bed with socialists.

498
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,248
I mean, the whole country's
falling apart.

499
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,606
Look at the state we're in.

500
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,689
We can't get decent servants.

Maude here,
working herself to a shadow,

502
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,610

503
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,165
Oh, by the way, Maudie,

504
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,603
I think a lemon syllabub
would go very nicely

505
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,086
with the sole tonight.

506
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,406
Of-- Of course, dear.

507
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,764
And, uh, perhaps a little
clear soup first, hmm?

508
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,490
Psst, psst, psst.

509
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,968

anything to me

about wanting a cremation.

515

Now, who authorized that,
may I ask?

516
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,684

It was what he wanted.

517
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,759
Oh.

518
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,286
There'll be some delay
over probate, I'm afraid.

519

We had a break-in at the office.

The Enderby deeds seem to be
temporarily misplaced.

in these things.

The doorbell rang
half an hour ago,

722

and I could hardly bring myself
to answer it.

723
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,042

Mrs. Gallaccio did say she'd
leave me some of her paintings.

Oh, no.
Nothing more, thank you.

Ah.

whether M. Richard Abernethie

766

I don't like to speak ill
of the dead.

But from what I know of Cora,

770

she wouldn't let the truth stand
in the way of a good story.

771

No, but Richard had been
to visit her,

You stayed here often, madame?

He invited me a few times
in the last weeks.

778
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,404
He was very low in spirits.

Your son, George,

Were you surprised
when your son, George,

did not inherit anything
from his uncle?

Yes, I was.

786
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,370
It was a cruel thing
for Richard to do,

787
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,767
and I find it hard
to understand.

788

00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:19,445

somehow meaningless.

M. Hercule Poirot.

1051
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:30,802

I have heard of you, of course.

1052
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,525
And me also of you, signore.

it goes before you.

1054

I am commissioned to investigate

1055
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:40,645
the murder of your late wife,
signore.

1056
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,524
I wish to invite you to Enderby,

1057
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,087
the home of her brother,
Richard Abernethie.

1058
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:48,647
Are you sure I would be welcome?

1059
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:52,287
I was not allowed in the house
of Signore Abernethie

1060
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:53,766
when he was alive.

1061
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,371
Well, the family,

1062
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:58,928
they are choosing keepsakes from
the house before it is sold.

1063
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,891
Perhaps you would like
to choose something

1064
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,451
on behalf of your late wife.

1065
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:05,485
If you insist, I come.

1066
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,322

- Good day.
- Signore.

1068
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:18,931
So, do you think
he's the murderer, Poirot?

1069
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,368
I must get up to Enderby myself.

1070
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,523

stuck there

1072
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:28,726

to Mme. Helen Abernethie.

<i>I will meet you there, mon ami.</i>

1074
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,322
But first I must go
to the theater.

1075
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:35,649
Uh, now, look, Poirot.
Please don't pester Helen.

1076
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,171
She had nothing to do
with all this.

1077
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:39,522
She wants to find out the truth
as much as we do.

1078
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:41,609
But she has no alibi
for the day after the funeral.

1079
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,040
- She was at Enderby.
- No, no, no.

1080
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:44,480
She left Enderby
early in the morning

1081
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:46,125
and did not return
until late at night.

1082

Well...

1083
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:48,966
Well, that's as may be.

1084
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:51,401
But she didn't kill anyone.
She wouldn't.

1085
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,682
She benefited from the death
of Richard Abernethie,

1086

Hm. You're not trying
to insinuate anything, are you?

Oh, no, no, no, monsieur.
I never insinuate.

But I-I was hoping to see
your wife.

You just missed her.

It is sad that it is to be sold,

1115
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:22,685
One has to accept
what comes in life, Mr. Poirot.

1116
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,963
There's no point in regrets
and looking back.

Madame, I only wish to discover
the truth,

and I understand that that is
your wish also.

[Bell chiming]

1560
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:56,762
M. Shane, I would like to speak
with you for a moment.

1561
01:16:56,960 --> 01:17:00,442
Mr. Poirot,
Michael didn't kill Aunt Cora.

1562
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:01,766
He couldn't have.

1563
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:04,361
But he won't be able to tell you
he has an alibi

1564
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:06,210
because on the day
after the funeral,

1565
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:07,731
he was with his mistress.

1566
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:10,042
Rosamund, I--

1567
01:17:10,043 --> 01:17:13,044
There's no point in lying,
Michael.

1568
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:16,244
Would you prefer
to be accused of murder?

1569
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:18,763
And you, madame?

1570
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:21,926
On the morning of the murder,
you were seen in Camden Town.

1571

Madame?

1576
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:38,371
I wasn't sure, you see.

1577
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:44,165
I'm an actress.

1578
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:49,241
The thought of getting fat
and losing my looks...

1579
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:53,807
Someone gave me a name and
address, but when I got there...

[ Sobs]

1581
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:57,322
...it was so sordid.

1582
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:00,651
I couldn't go through with it.

1583
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,843
I realized I wanted the baby.

1584
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:09,166
A baby?

1585
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:14,447
And the visit to the nuns?

1586
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:18,402
I felt ashamed.

1587
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:21,842
I wanted someone to talk to.

1588
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:25,842

How long have you known?

1592
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:37,122
A while.

1593
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:39,800
That's why you didn't tell me
about the baby?

1595
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:45,851
Rosamund, I swear--

1596

It meant nothing.

It's you I love.

1598
01:18:55,960 --> 01:18:57,325
I won't see her again.

1599
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:00,364
There's going to have to be
big changes, Michael.

1600
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:04,884
<i>Messieurs, dames.</i>

1601
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:10,285
I came here to Enderby

1602
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:15,168
to investigate a murder
and to solve a riddle.

1603
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:23,122
First... Richard Abernethie,
he dies suddenly, huh?

1604
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:25,766
And then at his funeral,
his sister, Cora Gallaccio,

1605
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:27,724
announces that he has been
murdered.

1606
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:30,520
But then, the very next day,

1607
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:33,929
she herself is killed
most brutally.

1608
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:36,964
<i>Her maid-- Pardon.</i>

1609
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:40,926
Her companion, Mlle. Gilchrist,
is poisoned with the arsenic.

1610
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:43,361
Mme. Helen Abernethie
is struck on the head

1611
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:44,891
and is rendered unconscious.

1612
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:47,327
The deeds of the house
go missing,

1613
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:51,127
and the will that is false...
is read.

1614
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:58,090
So now, which, if any,
of these events are linked?

1615
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:01,402
<i>Bien</i> s0r, whoever stole
the deeds of the house

1616
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:04,570
would have to have been absent
from the funeral.

1617
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:09,966
You, M. Timothy--
You have the great need of money

1618
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:11,810
and knew
that you would not receive any

1619
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,684
from the will of your brother.

1620
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:17,282
So you hatched a plan
that on the day of the funeral,

1621
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:20,000
you would break into the offices
of M. Entwhistle

1622
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:21,964
and steal the deeds of Enderby.

1623
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:24,288
Oh, that--
that's a preposterous idea!

1624
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:27,927
No, no, no. No, monsieur.
Your wife, she covered for you.

1625
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:30,322
Maude, I know you want to
get back to Timothy.

1626
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:32,761
I'll whiz through things
as quickly as I can.

1627
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,571
Please don't rush things
on my account, Mr. Entwhistle.

1628
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:38,286
So realizing that you had,
as you say,

1629
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:41,051
shot yourself in the foot,

1630
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:43,402
you decided to try to put right
your mistake.

1631
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:46,126
That's ridiculous.
[Chuckles] I'm an invalid!

1632
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:47,924

POIROT: For certainement,
when I talked with you,

01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:55,888
you claimed to have had

1636
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:58,162
It's a lot of nonsense.

01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:01,131
I think he's called your bluff,

1638
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:02,885
No, no, monsieur.

1639
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:05,811
You were desperate enough
for money to stoop to theft.

1640
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,048
The question remains--

1641
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:12,126
Were you desperate enough
to stoop to murder?

1642
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:18,001
You, Mlle. Henderson.

1643
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:22,241
You said that you had never been
before to Lytchett St. Mary.

1644
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:24,404
But when you spoke
to M. Entwhistle

1645
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:26,090
of the whereabouts
of your hotel,

1646
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:29,011
it was clear that you knew
exactly where it was located.

1647
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:30,884
Yes.
It's easy to miss.

1648
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:32,969
But you can see the church--

1649
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,324
Inspector Morton is here
to question you

1650
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:38,130
as to why you were in
Lytchett St. Mary

1651
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:40,721
on the morning
that your aunt was murdered

1652
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:43,924
and why you did not inform
the police.

1653
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:56,324
The morning after the funeral,

1654
01:21:56,520 --> 01:22:00,411
George rang to say he was going
down to see Aunt Cora,

1655
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:03,524
to ask about what she'd said
at the funeral.

1656
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:05,848
He doesn't have a car.
I offered to drive.

1657
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:07,485
And did you see her?

1658
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:14,121
No.
We didn't get to Aunt Cora.

1659
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:20,850
[Voice breaking]
We went to the hotel.

1660
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:33,850
It wasn't planned.

1661
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:38,443
But I can't forgive myself.

1662
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:39,721
If we'd gone to the cottage,

1663
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:42,327
we might have saved
Aunt Cora's life.

1664
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:45,409
And we're cousins!

1665
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,090
It's all wrong.

1666
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:53,361
I love him.

1667
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:57,442
So the two of you
were in Lytchett St. Mary,

1668
01:22:57,680 --> 01:22:59,489
and nobody saw you leave.

1669
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:09,524
So now I turn my attention
to motive.

1670
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:12,568
Because it is the psychology
of human behavior

1671
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:14,171
which interests me.

1672
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:18,331
Each and every one of you
would have killed Cora Gallaccio

1673
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:22,923
to stop her revealing your
murder of Richard Abernethie.

1674
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:27,690
But are these two deaths
inextricably linked?

1675
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:29,602
<i>Certainement,</i>

1676
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:31,409
Richard Abernethie,
he dies most suddenly.

1677
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:34,046
But there would have been no
reason to suspect the foul play

1678
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:35,605
had it not been for those words

1679
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:39,282
uttered by his sister,
Cora Gallaccio, at the funeral.

1680
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:43,450
But because of those words,

1681
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:49,044
you all believed
that murder had taken place.

1682
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:52,443
And so I ask myself a question

1683
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:56,850
that came into my mind,
you know, so suddenly.

1684
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:01,643
How well did each of you know
Cora Gallaccio?

1685
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:03,730
H-How do you mean?

1686
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:05,803
<i>The answer, mes amis?</i>

1687
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:08,889
Not well at all.

1688
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:11,887
And so I ask myself
another question.

1689
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:15,527
Suppose it was not
Cora Gallaccio

1690
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:17,364
who attended the funeral
that day.

1691
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:20,729
So Aunt Cora wasn't Aunt Cora?

1692
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:22,729
- Somebody else was murdered?
- POIROT: No, no, no.

1693
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:24,968
No. Madame, it was
Cora Gallaccio who was murdered.

1694
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:27,447
But perhaps it was not
Cora Gallaccio

1695
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:31,167
who attended the funeral
of Richard Abernethie.

1696
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:33,171
No.

1697
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:36,483
The woman who attended
the funeral that day,

1698
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:39,570
she came for one purpose only--
to exploit the fact

1699
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:41,603
that Richard Abernethie had died
most suddenly

1700
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:44,963
and to implant into the minds
of the relatives

1701
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:46,810
the thought
that he had been murdered.

1702
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:49,168
And this she managed to do
most successfully.

1703
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:51,124
What nonsense.

1704
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:53,766
I mean,
what was the point of it?

1705
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:55,200
Permit me to explain.

1706
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:58,529
If Cora Gallaccio announces that
her brother has been murdered

1707
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:01,570
and then she herself is killed
the very next day,

1708
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:04,127
then those two deaths
are bound to be considered

1709
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:07,483
cause and effect.

1710
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:09,887
And for Hercule Poirot,

1711
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:14,483
the prime suspect would be
one of the family.

1712
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:18,481
But... if Cora Gallaccio
is killed

1713
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:21,524
and her cottage is broken into

1714
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:24,166
and Hercule Poirot is not
convinced by this burglary,

1715
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:25,805
then where is he to look?

1716
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:27,849
Close at home.

1717
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:32,042
At the woman who shared a house
with her.

1718
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,764
You're not suggesting
I'd commit murder

1719
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:38,042
for an amethyst necklace
and a few sketches?

1720
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:41,767
Oh, no. No, no.
Mademoiselle, no.

1721
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:44,884
For something
much more important than that.

1722
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:48,044
One of the sketches
of Cora Gallaccio

1723
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:49,765
was of Polflexan Bay.

1724
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:51,007
It was Susannah Henderson

1725
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:54,090
who observed that it must have
been copied from a postcard

1726
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:58,928
because it showed that
the old pier was still in place.

1727
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:04,166
But, in fact, the old pier had
burnt down several years before.

1728
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:07,011
Mme. Gallaccio always painted
from the real life.

1729
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:10,488
You told that to us,
Mlle. Gilchrist.

1730
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:13,365
And then I remembered the smell
of the oil paint

1731
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:16,291
as soon as I arrived
at the cottage.

1732
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:18,325
You can paint, can you not?

1733
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:20,968
And you know a great deal
about painting

1734
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:23,811
because your father,
he was an artist, <i>n'est-ce pas?</i>

1735
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,446
And then Richard Abernethie,
he dies suddenly,

1736
01:26:26,680 --> 01:26:29,160
and the plan,
it sprang into your mind.

1737
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:31,124
How easy for you
to administer a sedative

1738
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:32,481
in her morning cup of tea

1739
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:35,365
to render her unconscious
for the day of the funeral

1740
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:39,281
while you play her part
at Enderby.

1741
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:42,725
Oh, and you knew Enderby well

1742
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:45,844
from hearing
Cora Gallaccio speak of it.

1743
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:49,803
So simple, then, to begin
with a remark to M. Lanscombe,

1744
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:51,769
well, to convince him
of your identity.

1745
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,162
Dear, dear Lanscombe.

1746
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:57,887
Do you remember
when you used to bring meringues

1747
01:26:58,080 --> 01:26:59,844
out to the tree house for us?

1748
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:00,962
But that's preposterous.

1749
01:27:01,080 --> 01:27:02,525
Nobody would have been fooled
for a moment.

1750
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:06,765
But nobody had seen Cora
Gallaccio for over 20 years.

1751
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:08,162
You wore her clothes.

1752
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:10,242
You padded yourself out
to show her gain in weight.

1753
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:13,245
No one would have suspected that
you were not Cora Gallaccio.

1754
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:15,687
And because Cora Gallaccio
always wore

1755
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:20,886
the hair that was false,
it was easy for you.

1756
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:24,962
But mannerisms are remembered.

1757
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:26,884
And Cora Gallaccio
had mannerisms

1758
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:29,327
that were most definite.

1759
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:34,208
All of which you practiced most
carefully in front of a mirror.

1760
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:38,325
And that was where you made
your first mistake.

1761
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:42,525
You forgot that an image in
a mirror, it is always reversed.

1762
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:46,924
So when you observed your
reproduction-- oh, parfait--

1763
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:50,363
of the birdlike tilt
of the head of Cora Gallaccio,

1764
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:52,329
you forgot
it was the wrong way around.

1765
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:57,361
And it was this that puzzled
Mme. Helen Abernethie

1766
01:27:57,560 --> 01:27:59,847
at the moment that you made
your insinuation.

1767
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:02,281
She could not quite
put her finger on what it was.

1768
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:04,244
But then with all the talk
about mirror images

1769
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:07,364
and how one sees oneself
as others see us...

1770
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:11,883
...she remembered.

1771
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:19,402
So she tiptoed downstairs
to make a telephone call.

1772
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:21,170
[ Bell chimes,
telephone clicks]

1773
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:23,408
But someone else was about.

1774
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:25,921
And they followed her down
to listen in.

1775
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:29,886
And, fearful of what revelations
she was about to make,

1776
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:31,366
struck her over the head
with a--

1777
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:32,965
I never did anything
of the sort.

1778
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:35,242
The whole thing is a wicked,
wicked lie.

1779
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:36,891
It was you that day.

1780
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:41,762
When we arrived, I vaguely felt
I'd seen you before.

1781
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:43,610
But, of course,
one never really looks at--

1782
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:44,722
No.

1783
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:47,366
One doesn't bother to look at
a mere companion help.

1784
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:49,642
A domestic drudge.

1785
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:50,762
But go on, Mr. Poirot.

1786
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:53,486
Go on with this fantastic piece
of nonsense.

1787
01:28:53,680 --> 01:28:56,251
<i>Merci, mademoiselle.</i>

1788
01:28:56,440 --> 01:28:58,329
I intend to.

1789
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:03,327
And then, to cover yourself
still further,

1790
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:06,569
you planted a letter,

1791
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:09,167
from Richard Abernethie
to his sister--

1792
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:10,600
of course, in a place

1793
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:13,246
where somebody would be bound
to find it.

1794
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:16,046
And in this letter,
there was a phrase,

1795
01:29:16,240 --> 01:29:17,890
oh, so cryptic,

1796
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:21,562
telling her that he had not long
to live.

1797
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:25,242
And then you actually poison
yourself with arsenic--

1798
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:26,965
badly but not fatally.

1799
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:30,283
Mademoiselle, you know, that is
a device that is also very old.

1800
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:34,246
It aroused my suspicions
but immediately.

1801
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:36,488
And what about the picture
of Polflexan?

1802
01:29:36,680 --> 01:29:37,727
Ah.

1803
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:41,203
I commissioned the valuer
of painting Signore Gallaccio

1804
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:44,483
to go to the cottage,
remove the painting,

1805
01:29:44,680 --> 01:29:47,524
and take it
to the London Academy of art.

1806
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:50,001
If you please, signore.

1807
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:20,244
If you please to observe.

1808
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:01,161
<i>Voilà.</i>

1809
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:04,327
A Rembrandt.

1810
01:31:04,520 --> 01:31:06,409
MAUDE:
[ Gasps ]

1811
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:10,241
Authenticated by two experts.

1812
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:12,761
I recognized it immediately.

1813
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:14,769
She didn't.

1814
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:17,440
Always going on about
how much she knew about art

1815
01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:19,409
and unable to recognize
a Rembrandt

1816
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:21,722
when it was under her nose.

1817
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:24,400
She was a thoroughly stupid
woman.

1818
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:26,602
Endlessly wittering on
about this place

1819
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:28,962
and what you all did
as children.

1820
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:32,289
You don't know
how truly stultifying it is

1821
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:34,721
to listen to someone talking
about the same things

1822
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:37,446
day after day
and pretending to be interested.

1823
01:31:37,640 --> 01:31:40,450
"Oh, yes, Mrs. Gallaccio,"
and, "Really, Mrs. Gallaccio?"

1824
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:42,927
And in truth just bored,
bored, bored.

1825
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:46,602
And nothing to look forward to
but more of the same.

1826
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:50,083
And then...

1827
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:53,328
...a Rembrandt.

1828
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:08,722
A Rembrandt had sold in London
a few weeks before

1829
01:32:08,920 --> 01:32:12,970
for £5,000.

1830
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:19,401
You killed her
in that brutal way for £5,000?

1831
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:20,931
No, no, no.No.

1832
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:24,846
Mademoiselle, you mistake.

1833
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:30,044
£5,000 would have bought
and equipped a tea shop.

1834
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:33,642
You understand.

1835
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:37,881
It was the only chance
I'd ever get.

1836
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:40,811
I had to have a capital sum.

1837
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:45,322
A chance to re-create
The Willow Tree.

1838
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:47,847
My own little place.

1839
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:50,244
Freedom.

1840
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:51,720
Independence.

1841
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:54,002
A servant to no one.

1842
01:32:54,240 --> 01:32:55,321
[ Door opens]

1843
01:32:57,200 --> 01:32:59,487
Perhaps you'd like to come along
with me, Miss Gilchrist.

1844
01:32:59,680 --> 01:33:01,967
Of course.
I don't want to be any trouble.

1845
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:04,851
If I can't have
my little tea shop,

1846
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:06,809
nothing much else matters.

1847
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:08,565
[As Cora ]
How very silly of me.

1848
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:11,730
I-I always do the wrong thing.

1849
01:33:11,960 --> 01:33:13,291
Oh, please forgive me.

1850
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:16,051
It was really very stupid.

1851
01:33:16,240 --> 01:33:17,480
I'm sorry.

1852
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:19,165
I-I'm so sorry.

1853
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:21,249
But, uh...

1854
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:23,090
Extraordinary.

1855
01:33:24,120 --> 01:33:25,929
How did you work it out?

1856
01:33:26,120 --> 01:33:27,610
What made you suspect her?

1857
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:32,169
It-- It was the flowers of wax.

1858
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:37,526
Mademoiselle, you remember
when you and your sister

1859
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:40,929
were arguing on the evening
that everyone arrived here?

1860
01:33:41,160 --> 01:33:42,810
Mlle. Gilchrist remarked
how artistic

1861
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:45,486
the flowers of wax looked
on the table made of malachite.

1862
01:33:45,680 --> 01:33:47,284
Well...

1863
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:51,723
Well, she could not have seen
them there because...

1864
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:54,566
Mme. Helen Abernethie had
removed them before she arrived.

1865
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:58,850
So the only time she could have
seen them was when she was here,

1866
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:03,807
masquerading as Cora Gallaccio.

1867
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,889
How clever of you.

1868
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:07,161
Will she hang?

1869
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:09,328
POIROT:
I cannot tell, mademoiselle.

1870
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:13,406
It may be that she will be
admitted to an institution.

1871
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:17,280
It is for the courts to decide.

1872
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:21,363
[Engine idling]

1873
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:29,250
I feel I should go.

1874
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:33,443
Give it a try at least.

1875
01:34:36,360 --> 01:34:38,966
I think it's probably
for the best.

I don't know.
