00:45:48,583 --> 00:45:50,624
Because the housemaid,
who was French, l think,

701
00:45:50,625 --> 00:45:52,415
and whom the police
were convinced

702
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:55,124
had knowledge of this crime
but was innocent,

703
00:45:55,125 --> 00:45:58,707
had also taken her own life
in the police cell.

704
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:01,749
Cassetti was arrested.

705
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:04,124
But his Mafia family in Chicago

706
00:46:04,125 --> 00:46:06,415
had the prosecutors and judges
in their pockets,

707
00:46:06,416 --> 00:46:10,040
and evidence, it was misplaced.

708
00:46:10,041 --> 00:46:14,957
And Cassetti, he walked away.

709
00:46:14,958 --> 00:46:16,957
Free.

710
00:46:19,833 --> 00:46:22,457
Excuse me,
but isn`t anyone going...

00:46:23,375 --> 00:46:26,415
...interview me about the events
of last night?

First, l really want to
apologize for the lights,

but we are seeing to it now.

717

ln the meantime, um,

718
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,415
a scarlet negligee is key
to solving the murder.

720
00:46:48,416 --> 00:46:53,540
So -- So l will need
all your suitcase keys, please.

00:46:55,083 --> 00:46:58,374
Poirot has just identified
Samuel Ratchett

722

as Lanfranco Cassetti.

723
00:47:00,041 --> 00:47:01,665

Yes, that`s right.

726

-And l-l don`t know what to do.
-What do you mean, Mr. Macqueen?

728
00:47:13,166 --> 00:47:17,040
My father was the D.A.
in the Cassetti case.

729
00:47:17,041 --> 00:47:18,624
He was the prosecutor.

730
00:47:18,625 --> 00:47:19,999
There is a link now

731
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,249
between my name -- Macqueen --
and the murder.

732
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:24,749
lt`s only
a matter of time before

733
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:26,374
Poirot remembers this
from the papers.

734
00:47:26,375 --> 00:47:29,832
He has an encyclopedic knowledge
of Cassetti`s crime.

735
00:47:29,833 --> 00:47:33,249
So, uh, you knew Cassetti?

736
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:34,874
But you didn`t recognize him

737
00:47:34,875 --> 00:47:36,082
when you worked for him,
did you?

738
00:47:36,083 --> 00:47:37,999
And the detective
is going to believe that?

lf it is the truth.

740
00:47:39,583 --> 00:47:42,665

Oh, yes. Yes.

742

Absolutely right.

-Could you make out his face?
-l couldn`t.

where did he go?

00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:29,707
He went back through here.

you had not bolted the door

Madame Hubbard,
in your life in America,

764
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:49,540
were you acquainted
with the family

765

of the young Daisy Armstrong?

766
00:48:52,166 --> 00:48:55,540
Well, l`d heard
of their tragedy, of course.

767
00:48:55,541 --> 00:49:00,082
But they were of the highest
society, and l am not.

768
00:49:00,875 --> 00:49:05,832
This man is the man
who murdered Daisy Armstrong.

769
00:49:08,625 --> 00:49:12,707
Well, if l`d known that,

770
00:49:12,708 --> 00:49:14,540
then, like any American mother,

771
00:49:14,541 --> 00:49:16,374
l`d have ripped
the bastard`s heart out.

772

lt certainly
wasn`t here yesterday.

[ Chuckles ]
He got all this from a button.

787
00:50:04,958 --> 00:50:07,915
Well, we know Cassetti was alive
at half past 12:00

788
00:50:07,916 --> 00:50:10,707
because he called out
to Michel, "Ce n`est rien."

789
00:50:10,708 --> 00:50:11,540
Non, non. Non.

790
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:13,457
M. Cassetti,
he could not speak French,

791
00:50:13,458 --> 00:50:15,540
which is why M. Macqueen
worked for him.

Brilliant!
Brilliant, monsieur!

793
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:18,540
So that must have been
the voice of the assassin.

Which fits with the watch
and the time of death.

795

No, but there were
at least two murderers.

876
00:54:40,458 --> 00:54:42,540
and l requested a massage.

877
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:45,999
POlROT: Ah, oui.

878
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,874
l left her asleep
at half past 2:00.

879
00:54:48,875 --> 00:54:51,624
l gave my lady a massage
and read more Goethe.

880
00:54:51,625 --> 00:54:53,999
And you did not hear anything
untoward in the carriage?

881
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,457
That is correct.

882
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:57,915
Princess Dragomiroff,
were you acquainted

883
00:54:57,916 --> 00:54:59,790
with the family
of Daisy Armstrong?

884
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,040
-Yes.
-My lady.

885
00:55:08,041 --> 00:55:11,832
Hildegarde, please.
Leave.

886
00:55:16,375 --> 00:55:20,332
l stayed many times at the
Armstrong house on Long lsland,

887
00:55:20,333 --> 00:55:22,832
as l was privileged
to be the godmother

888
00:55:22,833 --> 00:55:25,332
of Daisy`s mother, Sonia.

889
00:55:25,333 --> 00:55:27,082
Sonia was the daughter

890
00:55:27,083 --> 00:55:29,874
of the great tragic actress
Linda Arden,

891
00:55:29,875 --> 00:55:32,832
of whom l had been an admirer
for many decades.

892
00:55:34,958 --> 00:55:38,707
Yeah, if my memory is correct,

893
00:55:38,708 --> 00:55:43,165
Linda Arden,
it was a stage name, oui?

894
00:55:43,166 --> 00:55:45,332
Taken from the Shakespeare.

895
00:55:45,333 --> 00:55:47,499
So, what was her actual name?

896
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:51,790
The name was Waterstone.

897
00:55:51,791 --> 00:55:53,749
Ah, yes, l am remembering now.

898
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:57,415
Linda Arden,
she had two daughters --

899
00:55:57,416 --> 00:56:00,874
Sonia Armstrong, oui,
and also a younger daughter.

900
00:56:00,875 --> 00:56:02,582
You are correct.

901
00:56:02,583 --> 00:56:04,249
Do you know what happened
to this younger daughter?

902
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:08,874
Mm, she married someone,
somewhere.

903
00:56:08,875 --> 00:56:11,374
l do not know
what happened to her.

904
00:56:14,458 --> 00:56:16,165
You know
it is Lanfranco Cassetti

905
00:56:16,166 --> 00:56:18,207
who has been murdered?

906
00:56:21,833 --> 00:56:27,624
Monsieur, if l had recognized
that man,

907
00:56:27,625 --> 00:56:30,832
do you know what l should have
liked to have done?

908
00:56:30,833 --> 00:56:34,374
l should have liked
to have called my servants,

909
00:56:34,375 --> 00:56:36,499
flogged this man to death,

910
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,499
and throw him
on the rubbish heap.

911
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:40,582
That is what was done
with such a man

912
00:56:40,583 --> 00:56:42,082
when l was young, monsieur.

913
00:56:42,083 --> 00:56:44,374
Make no mistake.

914
00:56:44,375 --> 00:56:48,707
l would have stabbed him as he
slept and been proud to confess.

915
00:56:55,791 --> 00:56:57,749
FOSCARELLl: Monsieur?

916
00:57:01,625 --> 00:57:04,499
Poirot. Poirot.
Do you think she did it?

917
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,707
No, that woman was frail.

918
00:57:06,708 --> 00:57:08,332
She would not
have the strength --

919
00:57:08,333 --> 00:57:11,332
-Monsieur?
-Signor Foscarelli.

920
00:57:11,333 --> 00:57:13,582
l hear talk of the Mafia
being responsible.

921
00:57:13,583 --> 00:57:14,999
BOUC: Yes.
Yes, that`s true.

922
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,874
l was talking to the gentleman.

923
00:57:16,875 --> 00:57:19,707
Monsieur, not all
ltalian-Americans are Mafia.

924
00:57:19,708 --> 00:57:21,082
Most of us spit on them.

925
00:57:21,083 --> 00:57:23,790
Now, l`m in the motor trade.
l`m a good salesman.

926
00:57:23,791 --> 00:57:25,915
But it`s hard to be trusted
when you`re ltalian.

927
00:57:25,916 --> 00:57:29,749
Men like Cassetti,
they make people hate us.

928
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:34,207
Monsieur, if these gangsters
are involved,

929
00:57:34,208 --> 00:57:35,874
do not mess with them.

930
00:57:35,875 --> 00:57:37,540
Understand me?

931
00:57:37,541 --> 00:57:39,457
For they are ruthless to anyone,

932
00:57:39,458 --> 00:57:41,665
anyone who crosses them,
and you are no exception!

933
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:44,874
-You understand that?
-Hey, is that a threat?

934
00:57:46,125 --> 00:57:50,249
lt is advice, monsieur.

935
00:57:52,041 --> 00:57:52,999
Merci.

936
00:57:54,208 --> 00:57:56,207
-[ Knock on door ]
-Come in.

937
00:57:56,208 --> 00:57:58,499
BOUC: How dare
you threaten M. Poirot?

938
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,207
The water.

939
00:58:01,708 --> 00:58:03,540
The water is not working.

940
00:58:03,541 --> 00:58:06,249
-l wasn`t threatening anybody.
-SCHMlDT: What is happening?

941
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:11,165
Fraulein Schmidt,
does this belong to your lady?

942
00:58:12,875 --> 00:58:14,790
No.

943
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:16,915
-She`s Natalia.
-Ah.

944
00:58:16,916 --> 00:58:18,749
lt`s her style
but not her initial.

945
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:20,082
Merci.

946
00:58:20,083 --> 00:58:21,832
And tell to me if you please --

947
00:58:21,833 --> 00:58:23,582
Were you also
the frequent visitor

948
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:25,290
to the Armstrong house
in Long lsland?

949
00:58:25,291 --> 00:58:27,374
Yes. No.

950
00:58:27,375 --> 00:58:29,540
l knew the Long lsland home,

951
00:58:29,541 --> 00:58:33,540
but l`ve worked at an adjacent
property, another family.

952
00:58:33,541 --> 00:58:35,374
That was how l met my lady.

953
00:58:35,375 --> 00:58:37,124
And you are a good cook, eh?

954
00:58:37,125 --> 00:58:40,207
Yes. [ Laughs ]
All my ladies have said that.

955
00:58:40,208 --> 00:58:41,165
Bon.

956
00:58:43,833 --> 00:58:46,040
N-No.

957
00:58:46,041 --> 00:58:47,290
l`m a maid.

958
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:52,707
Ah, forgive me, but you appear
to be more expert in the food.

959
00:58:52,708 --> 00:58:54,832
...which is made with parsley

960
00:58:54,833 --> 00:58:57,582
and no more cooked
than 30 seconds.

961
00:58:57,583 --> 00:59:00,415
No.
l`m a lady`s maid.

962
00:59:00,416 --> 00:59:04,790
The reason -- The reason
l`m so nervous, monsieur,

963
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:08,749
and get things wrong
is that l saw the murderer.

964
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:13,582
l saw him with my eyes when
l finished my lady`s massage.

965
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:19,415
l came out of the compartment
and passed a lady in a kimono,

966
00:59:19,416 --> 00:59:21,415
but she had a man`s face.

967
00:59:21,416 --> 00:59:22,957
l also saw her.

968
00:59:22,958 --> 00:59:26,040
And, well, she looked like
a woman from the back.

969
00:59:26,041 --> 00:59:28,915
No. A man.

970
00:59:28,916 --> 00:59:30,040
Ja?

971
00:59:30,041 --> 00:59:32,290
So when did you see him?

972
00:59:32,291 --> 00:59:34,540
Because l did not notice you
when l saw him.

973
00:59:34,541 --> 00:59:36,665
Um...

974
00:59:36,666 --> 00:59:38,290
At 2:30.

975
00:59:38,291 --> 00:59:39,499
And can you describe him?

976
00:59:40,833 --> 00:59:46,415
He was small, round, and dark.

977
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:49,624
And when l heard his voice
as he said ``pardon,``

978
00:59:49,625 --> 00:59:52,999
it was a woman`s voice --
weak like a woman.

979
01:00:00,041 --> 01:00:01,290
Merci.

980
01:00:23,375 --> 01:00:25,582
There is no power,
no power at all.

981
01:00:25,583 --> 01:00:27,874
And it will be
minus-10 degrees tonight.

982
01:00:27,875 --> 01:00:30,415
And they cannot get here
with the plow until the morning.

983
01:00:30,416 --> 01:00:33,082
MlCHEL:
What are you doing?

984
01:00:33,083 --> 01:00:34,915
-BOUC: How will they cook food?
-MlCHEL: Hey.

985
01:00:34,916 --> 01:00:37,457
-BOUC: How will we stay warm?
-All his buttons are here.

986
01:00:37,458 --> 01:00:39,249
And sewn with old thread,

987
01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:42,457
so this button must have come
from a second uniform, Poirot.

988
01:00:42,458 --> 01:00:46,290
Well, so who do you want me
to call now?

989
01:00:46,291 --> 01:00:47,457
Miss Debenham?

990
01:00:48,208 --> 01:00:50,457
Non, non, non, non.

991
01:00:50,458 --> 01:00:52,957
Not Mlle. Debenham.

992
01:00:53,875 --> 01:00:55,749
Not yet.

993
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:57,749
Last night, Count Andrenyi,

994
01:00:57,750 --> 01:01:00,832
l saw you and your wife
trying to disembark at Belgrade.

995
01:01:00,833 --> 01:01:02,957
My wife can be claustrophobic.

996
01:01:02,958 --> 01:01:05,874
lt is difficult for her
on the train.

997
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,915
No. Last night
she took a draft of Trional.

998
01:01:13,916 --> 01:01:16,832
My word of honor.

999
01:01:18,083 --> 01:01:19,874
l did not question your honor.

1000
01:01:19,875 --> 01:01:22,249
l am afraid, Poirot,
neither of us

1001
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:25,665
can be of use to you
in this sad investigation.

1002
01:01:28,125 --> 01:01:29,624
Non, monsieur.

1003
01:01:36,916 --> 01:01:38,415
COUNT ANDRENYl:
l spent two years in Washington

1004
01:01:38,416 --> 01:01:41,790
at a posting to the embassy.

1005
01:01:41,791 --> 01:01:43,582
You were there five years ago,
l see.

1006
01:01:43,583 --> 01:01:44,415
Yes.

1007
01:01:44,416 --> 01:01:47,207
l remember the Armstrong murder
in the papers,

1008
01:01:47,208 --> 01:01:51,749
if that`s what you`re...
alluding to.

1009
01:02:00,458 --> 01:02:02,124
So this spot of grease
is the result

1010
01:02:02,125 --> 01:02:04,790
of an official
who was careless, eh?

1011
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,290
Why does she have to write
her name?

1012
01:02:18,291 --> 01:02:21,415
S`il vous plait,
as it appears in the passport.

1013
01:02:39,833 --> 01:02:41,957
Merci.

1014
01:03:11,083 --> 01:03:14,457
Doctor, what is the latest?

1015
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:18,665
The German maid
said she saw the murderer.

1016
01:03:18,666 --> 01:03:20,165
Gave Poirot a description.

1017
01:03:31,625 --> 01:03:35,124
DEBENHAM: Why have you not yet
questioned me, monsieur?

1018
01:03:35,125 --> 01:03:39,165
Mlle. Debenham, why do you
and Colonel Arbuthnot

1019
01:03:39,166 --> 01:03:40,290
pretend not to know each other

1020
01:03:40,291 --> 01:03:42,582
when it was quite clear in
lstanbul that you were intimate?

1021
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:45,957
No, don`t.

1022
01:03:45,958 --> 01:03:48,374
When it`s all over -- then.

1023
01:03:48,375 --> 01:03:50,540
When what was all over, huh?

1024
01:03:50,541 --> 01:03:52,790
Hmm? What?

1025
01:03:52,791 --> 01:03:55,082
-l`m not at liberty to say.
-Oh, liberty.

1026
01:03:57,125 --> 01:04:01,207
Mademoiselle, you will give me
a good answer.

1027
01:04:01,208 --> 01:04:02,749
Or when the Yugoslav police
arrive,

1028
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:04,374
you will not be at liberty.

1029
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,790
-Now, give me an answer.
-Steady on, Poirot.

1030
01:04:08,791 --> 01:04:11,124
l am not at liberty to tell you.

1031
01:04:11,125 --> 01:04:13,290
POlROT:
Mademoiselle, do not cross me.

1032
01:04:13,291 --> 01:04:14,790
A murder has been committed,

1033
01:04:14,791 --> 01:04:17,790
and l have seen you
behaving suspiciously

1034
01:04:17,791 --> 01:04:19,249
both before and after
the crime took place.

1035
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:21,082
-You leave her alone!
-John.

1036
01:04:21,083 --> 01:04:24,790
-Sir.
-Teddy, sit down.

1037
01:04:24,791 --> 01:04:26,415
POlROT:
Colonel Arbuthnot.

1038
01:04:26,416 --> 01:04:28,790
Maybe you can explain
what was meant by her words.

1039
01:04:28,791 --> 01:04:30,874
l met Miss Debenham in Baghdad.

1040
01:04:30,875 --> 01:04:33,665
She was a governess in a house
of an AOC, a friend of mine.

1041
01:04:33,666 --> 01:04:34,874
And you fell in love?

1042
01:04:36,166 --> 01:04:36,999
Yes.

1043
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,540
HUBBARD: What is it
with these men who go around

1044
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:39,915
falling in love with the staff?

1045
01:04:39,916 --> 01:04:41,415
Will you shut up?

1046
01:04:41,416 --> 01:04:43,665
Why the secrecy?

1047
01:04:43,666 --> 01:04:45,415
l am currently suing

1048
01:04:45,416 --> 01:04:48,665
my unfaithful wife of 20 years
