00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:06,006
23.976

2
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:39,831
- Good night, Annie.
- Good night Fi.

3
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,127
- Oh! Annie, will you be going to Bluebell tonight?
- No, not tonight, I'm tired.

4
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,588
- Early night.
- Oh! Wish it was early...

5
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:50,259
See you tomorrow!

6
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,026
Well, tonight is my lucky night, gentlemen.

7
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:13,115
Thank all for turning up with your pockets
full of donations,

8
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:17,911
for what, I can assure you, will be
a better cause.

9
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:49,860
I will raise you.

10
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:53,071
Let us see... what kind of folks
do we think you've got?

11
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,450
What kind of Dad will pay
your debts?

12
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:58,202
Leftenant Race.

13
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,496
Excuse me, chaps.

14
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:08,253
- You must come now.
- Fiona, darling, I can't.

15
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,381
I'm in the middle of.
It's a good night.

16
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,384
- It's her, Colin, she's taking something from the—
- 20 minutes,

17
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:16,803
and then you got me for a lifetime.
You won't be able to get rid of me.

18
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:18,847
- She's rolling it up in the—
- Fiona, listen,

19
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:22,392
20 minutes and we can celebrate.
Wait, just wait.

20
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:24,811
Well, where were we?

21
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,917
- Good night.
- Good night, ma'am.

22
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,641
Fiona!

23
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,145
Fiona, come here! Fiona!

24
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,147
Fiona, come here!

25
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,357
Fiona! Stop!

26
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:54,026
Come here.

27
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:57,404
- What're you doing?
- I saw you take the papers.

28
00:03:57,613 --> 00:03:59,489
- Come back with me.
- Get away!

29
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:02,951
Stop! Please!

30
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:04,286
Stop!

31
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,551
d d

32
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:24,348
And so, madam,
may I ask you a question?

33
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:28,101
You may,
but I might not answer.

34
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,104
My mother taguht me it was rude

35
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:33,899
to answer a question
before six o'clock in the evening.

36
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:37,486
Specially from a Swedish gentleman,
Herr Hjerson.

37
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,238
But I'm Finnish.

38
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:43,283
I wish you would finish,
I'd like to go and get myself a drink.

39
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:48,956
Do you not think that the murder
of your husband...

40
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:51,959
- The lipstick.
- The scarlet lipstick on his collar,

41
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:54,419
- The Bible on his desk...
- The good samaritan.

42
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:57,297
opened on the page of
the good samaritan,

43
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:59,174
- The word "Revenge"...
- Revenge.

44
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:02,511
written with his blood on the blotter

45
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:07,266
is littered with
what we call in Finnish: "puna silli".

46
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:10,727
Red herrings, madam.

47
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,565
Red herrings.

48
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:27,953
It looks very suspicious,
in my opinion.

49
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,248
It's the vicar.
Never trust a vicar.

50
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:34,168
Isn't she smart,
Ariadne Oliver.

51
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,464
I didn't think fiction
was your thing, Poirot.

52
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:44,011
Oh, par l'amour de Dieu.
It is my friend Colin.

53
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,597
- But it has been so long.
- Good evening, Sir.

54
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:50,225
How does your father,
my good old friend, coronel Race?

55
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:51,768
My old man's fine.

56
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:54,062
Enjoying his retirement.

57
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:57,316
Another whisky for my young friend,
s'il vous plait.

58
00:05:57,608 --> 00:05:58,775
Thank you.

59
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:02,321
Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats.

60
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,990
- I need your help, sir.
- But of course.

61
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,118
I already had realised that
this meeting is not a coincidence.

62
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:12,581
I imagine that you sought me at my
apartament and George, mon valet,

63
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:14,833
told you where I could be found.

64
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:16,502
But, if I may,

65
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:20,923
you have the appearance of someone
who has traveled this evening a great distance.

66
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:24,301
Dover.

67
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,804
Can we talk after the final act?
I don't want to ruin your enjoymen with the play.

68
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:30,265
Oh! Non, non, non. For Poirot,
the play, it is over.

69
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:33,393
With my dear friend madame Oliver,
this puzzle it is not

70
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:35,145
so intricate.

71
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:39,650
Non, non. She's not in the same class as
par exemple, monsieur Garry Gregson.

72
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:41,568
- You are acquainted with his books?
- Of course.

73
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:45,656
So, let us find somewhere here to seat
and allow me to help you, mon ami.

74
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:50,827
There's a girl in Dover.

75
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:55,582
She works in one of those secretarial
bureaus, you know, typists place,

76
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:59,545
where you ring and hire
a typist for an hour or whatever you want.

77
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:02,464
And how does she call herself?

78
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:06,635
Sheila Webb.
Are you all right?

79
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:09,471
Ah, oui, oui.
Poirot, he listens.

80
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:15,352
Anyway, yesterday a very strange thing
happened to Sheila Webb.

81
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:29,950
Four and six. I only got them yesterday
and it snaps off like a twig in a storm.

82
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,786
Sheila, have a look at this. Four and six,
from Jolly's, I only strut off to lunch,

83
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:36,415
and the heel snaps out in a grate
like a twig out in a storm.

84
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,501
Aren't you supposed to be typing up
mr. Lavine's manuscrypt, Nora?

85
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,461
"Naked Love", yes.

86
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,922
Well, put your shoes away and get on with
"Naked Love"

87
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:45,883
Miss Webb, may we have a word?

88
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:48,093
"Desire had him in its grasp,

89
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:52,055
"and with frantic fingers, he tore the
fragile chiffon from her breasts

90
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:54,808
"and bent her over the soap..." What?

91
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:56,852
I've had a call from miss Pebmarsh.

92
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,647
She needs a stenographer for 3 o'clock.
She asked for you particularly.

93
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:02,649
Have you worked for her before?

94
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:05,068
I don't remember doin' it,
miss Martindale.

95
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:09,865
- 19 Wilbraham Crescent.
- I can't remember going there.

96
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:12,451
Well, it's you she asked.
For three.

97
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,703
Have you any other appointments?

98
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:21,418
Ah, yes, professor Purdy, at 5,
at the Castle Hotel.

99
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:27,299
Cavendish Secretarials Services,
one moment please.

100
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:30,135
Sheila, miss Pebmarsh said
if she's not there,

101
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:33,805
the door is not latched.
You're to let yourself in and wait.

102
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:42,981
So Sheila goes.
And she really doesn't recognize the place.

103
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:46,318
Wilbraham Crescent
is one of those quiet streets

104
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:50,864
away from the sea front where
everyone keeps themselves to themselves.

105
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:04,169
Hello?

106
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:06,588
Miss Pebmarsh?

107
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:16,765
Sheila Webb here,
from Cavendish.

108
00:09:21,854 --> 00:09:25,440
Miss Pebmarsh, if it's all right
I'm gonna seat in the front room.

109
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:31,965
Is somebody here?

110
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,552
Is somebody in my house?

111
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:43,268
There's somebody in this room.
Who are you?

112
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,147
No, don't step on him, he's dead!
You're gonna step on him!

113
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:49,942
Who are you?

114
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:58,158
- Please, help me!
- What is it?

115
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:01,078
He's in there, he's dead,
he's dead, and...

116
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:04,206
- He's just lying there, stabbed on the floor.
- Who's been stabbed?

117
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:06,375
- There!
- Someone's dead in there?

118
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:10,379
- Yes, please help me.
- I will, I will help.

119
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:14,341
Are you saying there is
a man dead in number 19?

120
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,551
- Yes.
- All right.

121
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:18,720
- Let's go in.
- No, no, no.

122
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,265
Look, then let me go
and I'll call the Police.

123
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:23,684
- She's in there too.
- Who?

124
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,227
Miss Pebmarsh.

125
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,231
Right. Well, let's seat down and...
breathe.

126
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,984
- Stay here. I will help you.
- Yes.

127
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:46,415
Miss Pebmarsh?

128
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:48,917
Who are you?

129
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:51,670
I'm Leftenent Race.
I was passing by.

130
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:55,465
There's a dead man
behind my sofá.

131
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:03,140
- And how did this happen?
- I don't know.

132
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:05,517
- Who is he?
- I don't know.

133
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:07,603
I live alone.
I came home from work,

134
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:10,814
There was an hysteric on the house.
She left screaming.

135
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:14,234
And I found a dead man
behind the couch.

136
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:16,361
You're very calm.

137
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,823
When you saw what I saw in the
Great War, Leftenent Race,

138
00:12:20,032 --> 00:12:23,160
you know a dead man is not something
to be scared of.

139
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:26,246
If you will invite the young
hysteric in,

140
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:28,457
I'll make her a cup of sweet tea.

141
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:31,251
- I will call the Police.
- Very good.

142
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,713
« Who was this dead man?

143
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:39,092
« It's much stranger than that, Poirot.

144
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:41,011
Was he known from
mademoiselle Sheila Webb?

145
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,387
Apparently not.

146
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:44,973
No, I've never seen him before, Inspector.

147
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,226
You're positive about that?

148
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:51,313
Miss Martindale said to come here
at three and let myself in.

149
00:12:51,522 --> 00:12:55,317
I then noticed the clocks and thought
I might have caught the wrong time.

150
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:59,530
and then, just before Miss Pebmarsh
arrived I noticed the man lying there.

151
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:01,657
You worked for Miss Pebmarsh before?

152
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:05,077
No, and that's the thing, sir.

153
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,454
She asked for me specially.
I don't know how she knew about me.

154
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:11,333
Sir, we can't find the murder weapon.
There's no knife.

155
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:16,713
He's mr. RH Curry.
Metropolitan and Provicial Insurance.

156
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:19,675
I don't know him.

157
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:23,136
Stay here.

158
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:34,064
I've never heard the name Curry
or the name of his firm.

159
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:38,819
- Were you expecting any visitor today?
- No.

160
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,196
And I've never seen this man before.

161
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:42,739
Take him away.

162
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:46,201
Just the typist you ordered.

163
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:49,413
I didn't order a typist.
What are you talking about?

164
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:52,249
You didn't ring up the Cavendish Bureau
at lunch time today

165
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:54,084
and asked for the services
of Sheila Webb?

166
00:13:54,293 --> 00:13:58,130
Certainly not.
And I've never heard of a Sheila Webb.

167
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:00,424
Where were you at lunch time?

168
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:04,219
I work part-time at mr. Wright's
photography studio on the parade.

169
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:07,139
Taking bookings, seeing people in.

170
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,057
Lunch time can be quite busy.

171
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:11,852
And you did not ring the Cavendish bureau?

172
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:17,399
No, young man, I did not. I did my shift.
And returned home as usual just after three.

173
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:21,403
I know I wasn't late because I heard
my cuckoo clock as I approached the door.

174
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:25,741
What about your other clocks?
Why are they all set to 15 minutes past four?

175
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:27,409
What "other clocks"?

176
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:29,995
Your four other clocks in the sitting room.

177
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:35,626
There are no four other clocks in my sitting room.
Just my cuckoo clock.

178
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:41,256
And Mademoiselle Pebmarsh,
does she always keep unlocked her door?

179
00:14:41,465 --> 00:14:44,051
- You're thinking, I imagine, of her neighbors?
- Oui.

180
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:47,888
They saw nothing. On one side there's
a cat lady

181
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:50,182
who literally could speak of nothing else.

182
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,434
A Tiddly-pops likes chicken,

183
00:14:52,643 --> 00:14:56,271
Copenhagen loves his kittens,
don't you Copey?

184
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:58,899
On the other side, a brother and sister,
academics.

185
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:01,610
They saw nothing at all, during lunch time.

186
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:04,821
At the back of the house,
there's no access at all.

187
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:06,823
And mademoiselle Martindale?

188
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:09,034
It wasn't miss Pebmarsh who called
and rang me?

189
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:11,662
- You yourself took the call?
- Yes,

190
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,456
at about a quarter to two.
And I put her in the book.

191
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:18,919
And those clocks, they definitely do not belong
to mademoiselle Pebmarsh?

192
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:20,420
That's what she says.

193
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:24,258
Eh bien. It is a puzzle.

194
00:15:24,675 --> 00:15:27,553
But there is something else
that puzzles Poirot.

195
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:29,054
You.

196
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:34,309
Why was Colin Race at Wilbraham Crescent
at three o'clock yesterday afternoon?

197
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:38,939
And why do the Police permit that you
should ask questions during the interviews?

198
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:44,319
And why is it that your eyes are inflamed
with crying, my dear friend?

199
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:51,034
I have a comission in the Navy,

200
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:56,081
but, uh... I'm... I'm MI6.

201
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:59,418
Under Dover Castle, ever since
the Napoleonic Wars,

202
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,837
there's been a series of tunnels.

203
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:05,132
We're on the process of turning them
in a bomb-proof HQ, where

204
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,176
the Navy can police the channel
from width,

205
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:10,220
come the things turn into
a 2nd world war against Germany.

206
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:14,975
I've been trying to locate a
German mole amongst he staff.

207
00:16:15,184 --> 00:16:17,644
Three nights ago I found it.

208
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:19,688
Annabel Larkin.

209
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:22,524
She was followed an she was killed,

210
00:16:23,192 --> 00:16:25,235
along with the woman I loved.

211
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:27,738
Fiona Hanbury,

212
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:31,909
who died because I wasn't there.

213
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:45,756
Amongst Fiona's things
I found this.

214
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,010
A crescent,

215
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:54,139
the letter M and the number 61.

216
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:57,851
I think it's a note as to
where Fiona followed Larkin.

217
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:01,563
Where her contact was.
I checked out The Crescent pub

218
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:03,899
and there's a half dozen
Crescent roads in Dover.

219
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:06,610
And you were checking out the
Wilbraham Crescent

220
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:10,781
at the very instant when
Sheila Webb runs out of nr. 19?

221
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:12,908
Yes, I was checking again,

222
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:16,537
It was closest to the scene of
the accident.

223
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:20,958
And I may sound crazy, but I don't
believe it was a coincidence.

224
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:24,253
I believe the man dead
in Wilbraham Crescent

225
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:26,630
must be connected in some way
with Annabel Larkin.

226
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,130
Possible.

227
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:30,717
And I don't believe what the Police
is thinking that Sheila Webb is a murderer.

228
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:33,011
- I see.
- She's the main suspect.

229
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:38,058
She's the one who found the body,
she's the one they can place alone in the house.

230
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:41,562
And I saw how scared she was,
when she ran from the house.

231
00:17:41,645 --> 00:17:42,521
Help me!

232
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:44,731
I know she's not a murderer.

233
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,441
I will help you.

234
00:17:46,942 --> 00:17:50,779
And I won't let another girl down
because I was unable to help.

235
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:16,430
Good morning, Gentlemen.

236
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,724
Well, it seems this is
a time for co-operation

237
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:23,187
between the Navy and the Police,
don't you agree?

238
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:26,940
We need to flush out what remains
of this German cell in Dover.

239
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:29,735
Intelligence tells me it could well
be connected

240
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:33,780
with the murder of this Insurance Agent
in - where was it?- Wilbraham Crescent.

241
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:36,575
That hasn't been verified yet,
Admiral.

242
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:38,660
It's not Wilbraham Crescent?

243
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:41,413
No, that he was an Insurance Agent.

244
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:45,375
Inspector, may I introduce you
to Hércule Poirot,

245
00:18:45,584 --> 00:18:50,672
who Leftenent Race has requested
be brought into this investigación.

246
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:51,340
But I think we can—

247
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,550
I verified with Whitehall
and Scotland Yard

248
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:57,471
and they tell me he's a detective
of excellent reputation

249
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,015
and we're lucky to have him on board.

250
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:03,310
If that's what I have to work with,
that's what I'll work with.

251
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,772
Any ideas, mr. Poirot,
just "pop them on the pot".

252
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:07,814
Merci.

253
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:12,861
It seems to me, that if we solve one of
problems here, we'll solve the other.

254
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:16,782
- Monsieur, may I have a word?
- Admiral. Inspector.

255
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:24,706
I remember your days
from the Belgian Police Force, monsieur.

256
00:19:24,915 --> 00:19:27,376
Or, at least, your reputation.

257
00:19:28,794 --> 00:19:31,171
- When did you leave?
- After the Great War.

258
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:33,131
Yes.

259
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,677
Do you know what they called
this trench of the channel during the war?

260
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:39,429
- "Hellfire Corner".
- And it will be again.

261
00:19:39,638 --> 00:19:42,516
Because there will be
a second war, Poirot.

262
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:47,271
And if Germany invades,
this is where they'll come.

263
00:19:48,272 --> 00:19:52,401
What was stolen on the other night, were the plans
of all minefields between here and France.

264
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:57,614
It is essencial to have those plans recovered
before they leave these shores, monsieur.

265
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,074
If Hitler sees them,

266
00:19:59,283 --> 00:20:03,203
then the front door of England
will be wide open.

267
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:08,917
You'll find us very organized here,
mr Poirot, very thorough.

268
00:20:09,126 --> 00:20:12,462
Only last year we dealt with a
very suspicious deat of a taxi driver,

269
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:17,092
and Scotland Yard made a point
of admiring our attention to detail.

270
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:23,056
Evidence, as you see, is documented
in a system of my own devising.

271
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:25,517
Prime suspect has her own board

272
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:26,935
as does the victim.

273
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:29,521
Where we will build our detailed profile.

274
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:32,566
But for me, the key is
this diagram here

275
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:35,152
and the key to my investigation is

276
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:37,446
"Someone must have seen something."

277
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,074
Oh oui, c'est tres bien ça.

278
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:44,119
As you can see,
from the unusual design of that street,

279
00:20:44,328 --> 00:20:48,040
it is a crescent that
doubles back on itself, mr. Poirot.

280
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,794
All of them knew that miss Pebmarsh
followed a strict routine

281
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:56,089
and the house would be empty
at the middle of the day.

282
00:20:56,465 --> 00:20:59,426
and who lives opposite mademoiselle
Pebmarsh, in the number 61?

283
00:20:59,635 --> 00:21:01,011
Mr. And mrs. Bland.

284
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:04,598
A monsieur Bland?
Already that arouses my suspicions.

285
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:06,808
Oh no, no, no, he's a good man.

286
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,936
Built my mother-in-law a fireplace, actually.

287
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:13,023
I had London run a check on him
straight away, sir, he's as clean as a whistle.

288
00:21:13,232 --> 00:21:15,692
And the murder weapon,
has it been recovered?

289
00:21:15,901 --> 00:21:17,069
Er, no, no.

290
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:20,364
And there was no signal of a struggle
at the house of mademoiselle Pebmarsh?

291
00:21:20,572 --> 00:21:22,115
Absolutely not.

292
00:21:22,324 --> 00:21:24,535
Then I would like to interview
the neighbours today, if I may.

293
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:27,204
Already done.
Those are their statements.

294
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:29,957
Non, Poirot would like to ask
questions of his own..

295
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:31,458
Yes, already done.

296
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:35,462
No, I would like to ask questions
of my own, Inspector Hardcastle.

297
00:21:35,671 --> 00:21:37,589
Of course you would. Of course.

298
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:40,717
And these are the clocks?

299
00:21:40,926 --> 00:21:44,721
Yes, we're on the sniff to find out
when and where they were purchased.

300
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:48,016
Dresden china clock.

301
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,435
- A French thing...
- Ormolu.

302
00:21:51,103 --> 00:21:53,605
And the silver carriage.

303
00:21:53,897 --> 00:21:55,357
And where is the fourth clock?

304
00:21:56,108 --> 00:21:57,860
There were only three clocks, sir.

305
00:21:58,068 --> 00:21:59,987
Unless you count the cuckoo clock.

306
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:02,406
No, no, no besides the cuckoo,

307
00:22:02,614 --> 00:22:05,784
there was a fourth clock, a traveling one.
And on it the name Rosemary.

308
00:22:05,993 --> 00:22:06,869
That's right.

309
00:22:07,077 --> 00:22:10,080
Don't tell me we've lost a clock,
for goodness sake!

310
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:14,710
When I booked the evidences, sir, there
were definitely only 3 clocks on that room.

311
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:22,634
But of course I remember
the Rosemary clock.

312
00:22:22,843 --> 00:22:24,887
- Have the police lost it?
- Perhaps.

313
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:28,557
- Perhaps it was stolen.
- Why?

314
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:33,187
I do not know, mademoiselle.
I cannot think it would be of any value.

315
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:37,900
No, it was a shabby thing.
The Ormolu, that was pretty valuable.

316
00:22:38,442 --> 00:22:39,651
Oui, oui.

317
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:42,196
Thank you.

318
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,824
Non, non, non.
Merci.

319
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,493
I'll have both, then.

320
00:22:51,288 --> 00:22:54,958
Mademoiselle, Leftenant Race
has told to me the last few days

321
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:57,294
have been to you quite an ordeal.

322
00:22:58,587 --> 00:22:59,713
Oh, yes.

323
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:02,341
It's not the shock
of seeing a dead man, I'm past it.

324
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:04,760
It's the terrible suspicion
the police have of me now. It's...

325
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:07,095
Did you see that board he had up Poirot?

326
00:23:07,304 --> 00:23:09,431
He had nothing on it,
no evidence, nothing.

327
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:12,559
Have you told to the police the truth
in everything mademoiselle?

328
00:23:12,768 --> 00:23:13,810
Of course sir

329
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:15,938
Entonces no debe preocuparse de nada.

330
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:22,277
I need to get back to work.

331
00:23:23,237 --> 00:23:26,073
- And so should we.
- Will you be all right getting back Miss Webb?

332
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:27,699
Yes, I'll be fine. Thank you

333
00:23:27,908 --> 00:23:29,034
Mademoiselle?

334
00:23:29,701 --> 00:23:32,621
Do you know what
means the name Rosemary?

335
00:23:32,871 --> 00:23:35,582
- No.
- It means "Remembrance".

336
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,418
Oh. Remembrance.

337
00:23:39,711 --> 00:23:40,462
Good bye.

338
00:23:41,004 --> 00:23:42,548
Au revoir.

339
00:23:58,063 --> 00:23:59,273
Merci.

340
00:24:02,401 --> 00:24:04,862
I saw and heard nothing
on the day of the murder

341
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:07,573
until I heard the girl scream.

342
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:10,367
Tiddly-pops was having
one of his turns, you see,

343
00:24:10,576 --> 00:24:12,995
and I was singing to him to calm him down.

344
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:16,456
you seem a bit
agitated yourself, monsieur,

345
00:24:17,082 --> 00:24:18,417
shall I sing to you?

346
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:21,336
Non, non, non, merci, Madame.

347
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:25,465
Tell to me if you please, do you have much
contact with Mdms Pebmarsh?

348
00:24:25,674 --> 00:24:28,093
Oh no, no, she keeps herself to herself,

349
00:24:28,302 --> 00:24:30,596
and does terribly well for a blindy.

350
00:24:30,804 --> 00:24:32,389
I see her pass by the window

351
00:24:32,598 --> 00:24:36,059
to and from the photographic studio,
regular as clockwork.

352
00:24:36,268 --> 00:24:38,353
I think if she were a cat

353
00:24:38,562 --> 00:24:42,733
she'd be one
of TS Eliot's practical cats don't you?

354
00:24:42,816 --> 00:24:45,152
Oui.

355
00:24:46,862 --> 00:24:49,448
Pardon, Madame, do you think
I might possibly see your garden

356
00:24:49,656 --> 00:24:51,742
and so remove myself from here?

357
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:54,203
Oh, yes, yes.

358
00:24:55,037 --> 00:25:00,000
Have you realised that
if you write TS Eliot backwards,

359
00:25:00,292 --> 00:25:02,419
it spells toilets?

360
00:25:04,087 --> 00:25:05,631
Well almost.

361
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:10,177
Copenhagen pointed that out
to me, didn't you, Copey?

362
00:25:10,469 --> 00:25:14,473
The bane of our neighbourhood...
are the Mabbutts. Númber 62.

363
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:17,434
He has girls with catapults.

364
00:25:17,643 --> 00:25:21,063
In fact I heard Miss Pebmarsh have
hard words with Mr Mabbutt

365
00:25:21,271 --> 00:25:25,108
just the other evening
about their behaviour.

366
00:25:25,567 --> 00:25:26,902
May I ask,

367
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:31,448
was there any connection between the murdered
man and Miss Pebmarsh, Lieutenant?

368
00:25:32,282 --> 00:25:36,662
- I believe not.
- Oh, that's unusual too.

369
00:25:37,246 --> 00:25:40,165
So he just
came there to be killed, did he?

370
00:25:43,752 --> 00:25:45,796
Miss Pebmarsh is as quiet
as a church mouse,

371
00:25:46,004 --> 00:25:47,756
- isn't she, Matthew?
- Yes.

372
00:25:47,965 --> 00:25:49,675
We heard neither hide nor hair -

373
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:53,095
we told the other Inspector. I don't know
why we're being asked again.

374
00:25:53,303 --> 00:25:55,472
She would have left her house
at eleven

375
00:25:55,472 --> 00:25:57,391
on the day
of the murder and got back at three.

376
00:25:57,558 --> 00:25:59,852
Yes, well that's her routine,
I'm sure everyone knows that.

377
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,980
And it is during that time that Ms Curry
would have entered the house,

378
00:26:03,188 --> 00:26:04,940
and met his death.

379
00:26:05,232 --> 00:26:08,694
Tell to me if you please,
before the girl screamed

380
00:26:09,111 --> 00:26:11,738
did you hear perhaps any sound
of a struggle?

381
00:26:12,281 --> 00:26:13,699
We don't know this man,

382
00:26:13,907 --> 00:26:16,702
and our studies are at the back
of the house Leftenant.

383
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,245
We're academics you see...

384
00:26:18,453 --> 00:26:20,998
And neither my brother nor I heard
anything at all during luncheon.

385
00:26:21,206 --> 00:26:23,917
We like this street
because it's quiet also.

386
00:26:24,251 --> 00:26:28,338
Yes the only trouble we've
had is that Mrs Hemmings.

387
00:26:28,881 --> 00:26:30,465
The cat lady?

388
00:26:30,674 --> 00:26:33,594
She might play the scatty
old dear, Leftenant,

389
00:26:33,802 --> 00:26:38,056
but scratch the surface and she's
a poisonous old bitch believe me.

390
00:26:38,932 --> 00:26:40,559
Rachel, we must get back to work.

391
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:43,645
Yes. Good day, Gentlemen.

392
00:26:44,563 --> 00:26:46,398
- Good day Madame.
- Good day.

393
00:26:52,613 --> 00:26:54,656
Well it's like
every other street in England.

394
00:26:54,865 --> 00:26:57,284
Full of people who keep
themselves to themselves

395
00:26:57,284 --> 00:26:58,911
while hating each other at the same time.

396
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:02,706
You should know we've had a, well I
was going to say breakthrough,

397
00:27:02,915 --> 00:27:05,042
but actually it's the opposite.

398
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:08,462
The name Curry has turned out
to be bogus, and the Metropolitan

399
00:27:08,462 --> 00:27:11,798
and Provincial Insurance Company
does not, and never has existed.

400
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:14,384
Was there anything else
found on the dead man?

401
00:27:14,593 --> 00:27:18,555
Labels on his clothes, or a wallet?

402
00:27:18,764 --> 00:27:22,851
All the labels were cut out.
We have no idea at all who he is.

403
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,436
This is most extraordinary.

404
00:27:24,645 --> 00:27:26,563
Can I tag along with you for a while?

405
00:27:26,563 --> 00:27:29,775
Someone will have seen
something, remember?

406
00:27:29,775 --> 00:27:30,651
Yes, of course.

407
00:27:32,069 --> 00:27:33,946
Eh bien,
now we go en arriere,

408
00:27:33,946 --> 00:27:37,366
to the rear to
a Monsieur and Madame Bland.

409
00:27:41,203 --> 00:27:42,913
I don't recognise him no, do you Joe?

410
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:47,417
No, I wish I did.

411
00:27:47,626 --> 00:27:50,254
And we've never had anything
to do with the blind lady.

412
00:27:50,504 --> 00:27:52,714
You read about these murders don't you,

413
00:27:52,923 --> 00:27:55,384
Jack the Ripper,
"Brides In The Bath Smith",

414
00:27:55,592 --> 00:27:58,929
and you think if only I'd been there

415
00:27:59,137 --> 00:28:00,472
and seen something.

416
00:28:00,472 --> 00:28:02,766
Stopped it in some way,
or if I couldn't stop it, at least

417
00:28:02,766 --> 00:28:04,434
been useful to the police afterwards.

418
00:28:04,434 --> 00:28:06,478
And now there's one in our
neighbourhood and we just didn't

419
00:28:06,478 --> 00:28:09,147
look out the window at
the right time, did we Valerie?

420
00:28:09,231 --> 00:28:12,401
Well you'll often find there's an
element of luck in police work.

421
00:28:12,651 --> 00:28:16,613
Witnesses looking out of windows
at the right time and...

422
00:28:16,655 --> 00:28:21,451
That's it, it's luck.
It's like falling in love,

423
00:28:22,244 --> 00:28:24,997
it's just lucky that you were
there on that night,

424
00:28:24,997 --> 00:28:28,917
and she was there, and it was luck
that bought you together.

425
00:28:29,668 --> 00:28:32,212
And where is it that you met
your husband, Madame Bland?

426
00:28:32,212 --> 00:28:36,508
Well she was an actress, weren't you?
I was quite low at the time,

427
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:41,513
and it just so happened that Valerie was
playing The Mikado in Dover weren't you?

428
00:28:41,555 --> 00:28:44,224
And we'd always go to
the same pub after the show.

429
00:28:44,224 --> 00:28:48,812
And I went there, just to get out
the house, and, well, luck struck.

430
00:28:50,272 --> 00:28:52,232
C'est formidable.

431
00:28:52,232 --> 00:28:56,111
Well this is all very lovely but, if we can
get back to the investigation,

432
00:28:56,111 --> 00:28:58,989
why weren't you working
on the day of the murder?

433
00:28:58,989 --> 00:29:02,743
Oh I'm almost retired now, Hardcastle.

434
00:29:03,577 --> 00:29:08,874
I've still got the van just to keep my
hand in, but Valerie inherited, well...

435
00:29:08,916 --> 00:29:10,792
A little bit of cash.

436
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:14,796
Well a lot actually,
from her Canadian family.

437
00:29:15,422 --> 00:29:17,466
Pardon. You are from Canada, Madame?

438
00:29:17,466 --> 00:29:20,052
Well I haven't lived there for, what is it?

439
00:29:20,052 --> 00:29:22,137
Oh well it must be nearly twenty years.

440
00:29:22,137 --> 00:29:23,222
Is it twenty?

441
00:29:23,222 --> 00:29:26,266
And she lost her accent when
she went to drama school.

442
00:29:26,266 --> 00:29:27,267
Ah.

443
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:30,854
And with the money I don't have to work.

444
00:29:30,854 --> 00:29:31,939
That's a bit of luck.

445
00:29:31,939 --> 00:29:35,025
Luck again, it's everywhere.

446
00:29:35,025 --> 00:29:39,029
- Luck Struck.
- Luck struck you see.

447
00:29:40,155 --> 00:29:43,992
Although it didn't strike
for this poor fellow.

448
00:29:44,034 --> 00:29:47,746
It's a pity the Blands weren't
murdered, don't you think?

449
00:29:47,746 --> 00:29:48,914
Or the entire neighbourhood.

450
00:29:48,914 --> 00:29:52,626
That cat woman struggles for a reason
to exist, if you ask me.

451
00:29:53,377 --> 00:29:56,088
Pebmarsh lives in a netherworld
all of her own.

452
00:29:56,088 --> 00:29:59,800
And those Waterhouses are a bit too quiet,

453
00:29:59,967 --> 00:30:03,679
a bit too hush-hush, if you know what I mean.

454
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,723
No, I don't know the deceased, sorry.

455
00:30:06,723 --> 00:30:09,226
I do not know what you mean,
Monsieur Mabbutt.

456
00:30:09,226 --> 00:30:12,145
I don't trust people who read
or write books, Monsieur Poirot.

457
00:30:12,145 --> 00:30:15,315
Never have. It's folks like that who have
got the world into the mess it's in.

458
00:30:15,315 --> 00:30:18,986
Were you here at lunchtime
on the day of the murder?

459
00:30:19,111 --> 00:30:22,739
I was, which is unusual.
I'm often away in the week

460
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:26,618
and leave everything to the nanny,
my wife has passed on.

461
00:30:27,411 --> 00:30:30,163
I work for Armstrong Ordnance.
We have contracts with the French,

462
00:30:30,163 --> 00:30:33,041
I spend most weeks over there.

463
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:36,920
Your country is as badly prepared
for war as ours is, Poirot.

464
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,338
I'm Belgian. Not French.

465
00:30:38,338 --> 00:30:39,548
- Are you now?
- Yes.

466
00:30:39,548 --> 00:30:45,095
A Walloon. Well Belgium won't last
a week if it all goes belly up, will it?

467
00:30:45,637 --> 00:30:49,183
Have you been visited by anyone
selling insurance in the last week?

468
00:30:49,183 --> 00:30:52,561
I told your constable all this, no.

469
00:30:52,561 --> 00:30:55,647
And I didn't hear sounds of a struggle
or somesuch either.

470
00:30:55,647 --> 00:30:58,108
Can I show you some pictures
of some clocks?

471
00:30:58,108 --> 00:31:00,402
I've left them inside,
will you accompany me?

472
00:31:00,402 --> 00:31:03,530
What do I have to look at clocks for?

473
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:07,409
To see if you recognise them, sir,
they're central to the murder.

474
00:31:07,868 --> 00:31:10,787
Very well. If I must.

475
00:31:15,834 --> 00:31:18,045
I would get your contacts to investigate
that man, mon ami.

476
00:31:18,045 --> 00:31:21,131
I'm on it. Yes, regular
trips to the continent,

477
00:31:21,131 --> 00:31:23,300
he's normally exactly what we'd look for.

478
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,594
But he's helping arm the French,
he's hardly pro-German.

479
00:31:25,594 --> 00:31:29,431
Put a letter M on the note of Mademoiselle
Fiona's it could be Mabbutt.

480
00:31:29,431 --> 00:31:33,477
Mabbutt lives at number 62 Poirot, not 61.

481
00:31:34,394 --> 00:31:36,021
Oui. That is true.

482
00:31:36,021 --> 00:31:37,981
I'll check on the Bland's finances as well.

483
00:31:37,981 --> 00:31:40,275
Make sure they got that windfall
the way they say they did,

484
00:31:40,275 --> 00:31:42,528
and it's not been channeled
from some continental bank.

485
00:31:42,528 --> 00:31:45,489
Yes.

486
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:02,130
Is that the garden of Mdms Pebmarsh?

487
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:03,841
Are you trying to work out
who killed that man?

488
00:32:03,841 --> 00:32:07,553
Oui. Were you playing here on
the day that he died, mademoiselle?

489
00:32:08,095 --> 00:32:11,473
Our nanny grounded us for two days.
Kept hitting the cats,

490
00:32:11,473 --> 00:32:12,474
Ah!

491
00:32:12,474 --> 00:32:14,726
So she kept us in
and we missed all the fun.

492
00:32:14,726 --> 00:32:18,397
Alors, you
call yourself mademoiselle Jenny.

493
00:32:18,397 --> 00:32:20,107
And how do you call yourself,
mademoiselle?

494
00:32:20,107 --> 00:32:22,109
May.

495
00:32:22,109 --> 00:32:23,402
And how do you call yourself?

496
00:32:23,402 --> 00:32:24,695
Hercule Poirot.

497
00:32:24,695 --> 00:32:28,532
That's not a name, it's a noise.

498
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:35,956
Alors, mademoiselle Jenny and
mademoiselle May will you help Poirot?

499
00:32:41,545 --> 00:32:44,006
Merci.

500
00:32:49,386 --> 00:32:52,931
I have been through this with
the police already Monsieur Poirot.

501
00:32:52,931 --> 00:32:54,433
Oui mademoiselle.

502
00:32:54,433 --> 00:32:58,687
And I did not make that call requesting
the services of Sheila Webb.

503
00:32:58,729 --> 00:33:01,815
Have you ever used a secretary
from the Cavendish Bureau?

504
00:33:01,815 --> 00:33:05,194
I may have lost my sight in
the last fifteen years, Monsieur,

505
00:33:05,194 --> 00:33:07,362
but I have not lost my self-sufficiency.

506
00:33:07,362 --> 00:33:09,948
Have you ever had any
dealings with the Bureau?

507
00:33:09,948 --> 00:33:13,911
Well I know where it is on the parade,
I pass it every day.

508
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:16,747
And some of the secretaries
may have been in for portraits

509
00:33:16,747 --> 00:33:19,917
with their sweethearts,
but apart from that...

510
00:33:19,917 --> 00:33:23,670
Your Ms Wright is an artist most fine.

511
00:33:23,921 --> 00:33:27,257
I believe he is, yes.

512
00:33:27,257 --> 00:33:30,260
One of the clocks found in your house
has gone missing Miss Pebmarsh,

513
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:34,640
a small travelling clock with the word
"Rosemary" engraved on the...

514
00:33:34,681 --> 00:33:36,475
If I may, Inspector.

515
00:33:36,475 --> 00:33:40,437
Mademoiselle Pedmarsh would you
tell to me please your glaucoma

516
00:33:41,647 --> 00:33:44,358
is it hereditary or brought on by the trauma?

517
00:33:44,358 --> 00:33:47,819
I drove an ambulance in your neck of
the woods, during the war Monsieur,

518
00:33:47,819 --> 00:33:51,657
and was temporarily blinded
by the blast of a shell.

519
00:33:51,657 --> 00:33:56,245
I regained my sight, only for
it to gradually deteriorate.

520
00:33:56,286 --> 00:33:59,957
- My sympathies.
- I don't seek sympathy, Monsieur.

521
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,626
Non.

522
00:34:02,626 --> 00:34:05,504
Miss Martindale is this way Gentlemen,
but do watch your step

523
00:34:05,504 --> 00:34:09,299
there's half-finished romances lying all over
the place in here, isn't there girls?

524
00:34:10,717 --> 00:34:13,053
- Tomorrow's inquest Inspector...
- Yes.

525
00:34:13,053 --> 00:34:15,055
How early would you recommend we get there?

526
00:34:15,055 --> 00:34:18,392
Only we're all terribly excited and we
wouldn't want to end up with seats

527
00:34:18,392 --> 00:34:19,977
at the back, would we Miss Martindale?

528
00:34:19,977 --> 00:34:24,731
It's not a football match, Nora. An inquest
is a serious legal procedure.

529
00:34:25,274 --> 00:34:27,985
Oh, I know. It's like a public hanging.

530
00:34:27,985 --> 00:34:31,154
I'm sorry Gentlemen, please come in.

531
00:34:31,154 --> 00:34:34,783
May I introduce Hercule Poirot.

532
00:34:34,783 --> 00:34:35,701
All right.

533
00:34:35,701 --> 00:34:37,661
Enchanté, madamoiselle. Merci.

534
00:34:37,661 --> 00:34:40,205
I typed up a bodice ripper last
year, about a public hanging,

535
00:34:40,205 --> 00:34:42,916
and it was so thrilling you wondered
why they ever put a stop to them.

536
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:45,127
Yes. Thank you, Nora.

537
00:34:45,127 --> 00:34:48,755
Miss Martindale would you again go
over the events of the phone

538
00:34:48,755 --> 00:34:51,800
call from someone purporting
to be Miss Pebmarsh.

539
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:57,222
Yes. Yes, I was sitting here when
the call came through.

540
00:34:57,264 --> 00:35:00,267
I made a note in the book and then I...

541
00:35:00,267 --> 00:35:04,938
Mademoiselle? If I may ask, did you
do the typing for Garry Gregson?

542
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:09,234
Yes. Yes, I was his private secretary.

543
00:35:09,276 --> 00:35:12,112
I set up the bureau with the money
he left me after he died.

544
00:35:12,112 --> 00:35:15,240
But I am a reader most admiring, mademoiselle.

545
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:20,662
I still manage his estate, all of his papers
are here, published and unpublished.

546
00:35:22,581 --> 00:35:24,833
"Bachelors In Peril".

547
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:26,835
Certainly one of his best.

548
00:35:26,835 --> 00:35:28,378
Oh, for goodness sake.

549
00:35:28,378 --> 00:35:32,925
A puzzle most intriguing,
but it did not confuse Poirot.

550
00:35:34,676 --> 00:35:36,094
"The Train At The Station"?

551
00:35:36,094 --> 00:35:39,932
Ah, oui, the hair of the moustache
on the cocktail glass,

552
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:45,687
the three pairs of shoes size six, all
designed to throw one off the scent,

553
00:35:45,729 --> 00:35:48,315
but not Hercule Poirot!

554
00:35:48,315 --> 00:35:52,361
Is there any chance we can get back
to the real police work here?

555
00:35:56,365 --> 00:35:59,576
- How's your afternoon?
- Miserable.

556
00:35:59,576 --> 00:36:03,247
Miss Martindale is as suspicious
of me as the policeman.

557
00:36:03,288 --> 00:36:06,959
Has your funny little friend
found out who did it yet?

558
00:36:06,959 --> 00:36:10,087
But if you ask me, Pebmarsh could easily be
lying about not making that phone call.

559
00:36:10,087 --> 00:36:11,380
That's what I've been thinking.

560
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,882
The body was found in her house,
she could easily have pinched that clock,

561
00:36:13,882 --> 00:36:17,553
whoever stole it must be
connected because it's...

562
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:26,353
What are you doing this evening?

563
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,564
Avoiding people.

564
00:36:28,564 --> 00:36:32,025
Yep. Me too.

565
00:36:32,025 --> 00:36:34,278
I've got to go back to the castle
but after would you,

566
00:36:34,278 --> 00:36:38,115
do you want
to avoid meeting people together?

567
00:36:39,491 --> 00:36:43,495
- Yes.
- Good.

568
00:36:44,329 --> 00:36:48,375
"How did you become blind",
"where did you fall in love",

569
00:36:48,417 --> 00:36:50,669
"what's your favourite
Garry Gregson novel",

570
00:36:50,669 --> 00:36:53,589
what on earth have these got
to do with the investigation?

571
00:36:53,589 --> 00:36:55,966
- Probably nothing.
- So why ask them?

572
00:36:55,966 --> 00:36:58,552
- To gather information.
- What information?

573
00:36:58,552 --> 00:37:03,265
Police work is facts, alibis,
evidence, not gossip!

574
00:37:03,307 --> 00:37:07,311
How did any case get solved in Belgium,
while you were in charge?

575
00:37:07,352 --> 00:37:09,438
Through the listening,
through observation.

576
00:37:09,438 --> 00:37:13,442
And every case it was solved,
I can assure you. Mademoiselle.

577
00:37:14,026 --> 00:37:17,654
It's been a long day, I'm sorry.
Can I give you a lift to your hotel.

578
00:37:17,654 --> 00:37:21,742
Ah oui, merci, but is there a hotel that
you would recommend, Inspector?

579
00:37:21,783 --> 00:37:24,286
Because I have not had the
time to make a reservation

580
00:37:24,286 --> 00:37:28,707
and also I must telephone to George,
mon valet, for my valise.

581
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:33,545
Yes, I know a good one. The Travellers.
I'll stand you a drink.

582
00:37:34,421 --> 00:37:36,798
- You coming?
- Can you drop me at the Castle?

583
00:37:36,798 --> 00:37:40,844
Of course.
You're in for a treat, Mr Poirot.

584
00:37:47,309 --> 00:37:51,813
We'll get a missing person's campaign out
on "Curry", pictures in the paper,

585
00:37:52,606 --> 00:37:55,192
bobbies at the train station,
the whole works,

586
00:37:55,192 --> 00:37:58,779
"Someone Will Have Seen Something"

587
00:37:58,779 --> 00:38:02,491
Inspector, this bar, does it have
a menu for the cocktails?

588
00:38:02,491 --> 00:38:05,869
That's the finest brew
on the South Coast, mate -

589
00:38:05,869 --> 00:38:08,997
the key now, is to find the identity
of the murdered man.

590
00:38:08,997 --> 00:38:11,917
Is this the best hotel in Dover?

591
00:38:11,917 --> 00:38:16,004
Yeah, let's line a few more
of these up, shall we? Terry?

592
00:38:20,008 --> 00:38:21,844
What are you laughing about?

593
00:38:21,844 --> 00:38:25,681
Poirot. I left him at the "Travellers
Inn" looking like petit fours in a chip shop.

594
00:38:25,722 --> 00:38:27,975
He's trying to keep it in,
but he's having forty fits

595
00:38:27,975 --> 00:38:31,353
about the thought of having to stay there.

596
00:38:32,354 --> 00:38:35,440
It's nice to see you laugh.

597
00:38:38,902 --> 00:38:42,781
Will you tell me about
the girl who died. Fiona?

598
00:38:44,116 --> 00:38:47,035
Fiona.

599
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:51,498
And then will you tell me about you?

600
00:39:00,007 --> 00:39:02,759
Sir.

601
00:39:03,427 --> 00:39:07,806
Hello, is that the Castle Hotel?
Bon.

602
00:39:07,848 --> 00:39:11,518
I wonder, do you have available
for a few days, a suite?

603
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:13,770
Oui. Hercule Poirot.

604
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:17,191
Non, non, non, Hercule.

605
00:39:17,191 --> 00:39:22,738
Oui. Poir... that will do.
Merci.

606
00:39:22,779 --> 00:39:27,701
I'm telling you Mr Poirot, Sheila Webb
made that call to Martindale.

607
00:39:27,743 --> 00:39:29,536
But there is no reason why she would.

608
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:31,955
There is no evidence, there is that,

609
00:39:31,955 --> 00:39:36,502
but in my gut I think once we have
the evidence it will point to her.

610
00:39:36,543 --> 00:39:38,795
But do you not think, as does
the Admiral Hamling,

611
00:39:38,795 --> 00:39:42,758
that the murder is connected in some
way to the theft of documents?

612
00:39:43,509 --> 00:39:48,055
Ah oui. Merci. A bientôt. Merci Monsieur.

613
00:39:48,096 --> 00:39:53,310
No I don't, that's Navy talk, they think
everything's related to the "coming war".

614
00:39:54,061 --> 00:39:55,604
There'll be no war.

615
00:39:55,604 --> 00:39:58,607
But I think the man will have
a link to Sheila Webb.

616
00:39:58,607 --> 00:40:01,610
She arranged to meet him
there, and killed him.

617
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:03,820
But with what motive, Inspector?

618
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:07,866
The clocks and the four-thirteen and
the Rosemary, will all come back to her.

619
00:40:08,367 --> 00:40:11,370
I've seen girls like that before,
and they're manipulative,

620
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:15,832
and let us see how she does under
pressure, at the Inquest tomorrow.

621
00:40:20,045 --> 00:40:23,715
I'm adopted. I have no-one.

622
00:40:25,217 --> 00:40:29,054
I was adopted by an elderly couple,
who had no children of their own,

623
00:40:30,722 --> 00:40:33,517
and, well, they're dead now.

624
00:40:35,477 --> 00:40:39,189
It's at times like this I long to have
a family to go home to.

625
00:40:41,733 --> 00:40:44,736
Do you have a sweetheart?

626
00:40:44,736 --> 00:40:47,281
No.

627
00:40:47,281 --> 00:40:50,993
- "damaged goods".
- I don't think so.

628
00:40:58,417 --> 00:41:02,337
You talk of Fiona in a way I don't
think anyone has ever talked of me.

629
00:41:14,183 --> 00:41:16,852
That's nice.

630
00:41:17,227 --> 00:41:20,480
This is nice, Colin.

631
00:41:33,327 --> 00:41:34,286
Ah.

632
00:41:34,286 --> 00:41:35,662
What is it?

633
00:41:35,662 --> 00:41:38,498
They've put cat muck on the mat again.

634
00:41:38,498 --> 00:41:42,878
They're pigs these people.
They're pigs.

635
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:46,632
I'll get a dustpan and brush.

636
00:41:47,549 --> 00:41:52,930
How do I look, is this too red, I don't want
to appear a dubious character.

637
00:41:52,971 --> 00:41:56,016
The Inquest will be full of plain-clothed
detectives eyeing the faces

638
00:41:56,016 --> 00:41:58,560
of the crowd surreptitiously
looking for give-away-signs,

639
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,188
at least that's what happened
in Garry Gregson's "Dusty Death",

640
00:42:01,188 --> 00:42:04,316
- do you remember that, Miss Martindale?
- Thank you, Nora. Yes, I do.

641
00:42:04,316 --> 00:42:07,194
That's how they caught the murderer.
Gave himself away with a nervous twitch.

642
00:42:07,194 --> 00:42:10,822
Will you elbow me if I start twitching
involuntarily, Miss Martindale,

643
00:42:10,822 --> 00:42:14,701
I'm worried about twitching involuntarily,
it used to be a habit of my mother's.

644
00:42:19,289 --> 00:42:22,543
Have you polished my new brogues, Valerie?

645
00:42:22,543 --> 00:42:26,213
HAVE YOU POLISHED MY BROGUES!

646
00:42:26,421 --> 00:42:30,592
Sorry. I do not want to miss
a word of this inquest.

647
00:42:31,677 --> 00:42:34,429
- By the back door.
- Thank you.

648
00:42:34,429 --> 00:42:35,764
I don't want to go, Joe.

649
00:42:35,764 --> 00:42:37,975
Get your coat on.

650
00:42:37,975 --> 00:42:41,478
Get it on.

651
00:42:45,399 --> 00:42:48,110
Come on, girls!

652
00:42:49,987 --> 00:42:53,615
Best seats in the house.

653
00:43:02,499 --> 00:43:06,837
- Sheila. It'll be all right.
- Don't, don't.

654
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:10,674
What's wrong? It'll be fine.
They're very dry - inquests.

655
00:43:11,508 --> 00:43:14,636
You just rattle the facts out.

656
00:43:16,054 --> 00:43:19,892
This arrived for me this morning.

657
00:43:26,523 --> 00:43:28,984
I received the call from a Miss Pebmarsh

658
00:43:28,984 --> 00:43:31,778
at about a quarter to two,
during the lunch hour.

659
00:43:31,778 --> 00:43:34,239
She was most particular in requesting

660
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:36,491
the services of my employee,
Miss Sheila Webb.

661
00:43:36,491 --> 00:43:38,952
I made a note in the book,
and then I checked Miss Webb's

662
00:43:38,952 --> 00:43:40,996
other appointments for that afternoon.

663
00:43:40,996 --> 00:43:43,916
Well, I wasn't the one who made
the call to the Cavendish Bureau

664
00:43:43,916 --> 00:43:47,961
I assure you, I merely arrived home
from work just after three o'clock

665
00:43:48,003 --> 00:43:52,049
and found a young lady in my front room,
suffering from a fit of hysterics.

666
00:43:52,841 --> 00:43:57,471
She ran out of the house, and then
I discovered the body behind the sofa.

667
00:43:57,513 --> 00:44:00,933
I spent my lunch break alone

668
00:44:00,933 --> 00:44:03,060
in the little cafe on the
corner of the parade,

669
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:05,562
and I must have got back
at about quarter past two,

670
00:44:05,562 --> 00:44:09,525
then left immediately
for Wilbraham Orescent.

671
00:44:11,193 --> 00:44:14,071
I entered the house, as instructed,

672
00:44:14,071 --> 00:44:18,075
and noticed all the clocks in the sitting
room were, well they were wrong.

673
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:23,497
This threw me a little and I checked
my own wristwatch, and then

674
00:44:23,497 --> 00:44:27,709
I saw the legs of a dead man I didn't
recognise sticking out from behind the sofa.

675
00:44:27,751 --> 00:44:30,671
If it pleases the court, I would
like to read a statement

676
00:44:30,671 --> 00:44:34,508
from the report of the police surgeon,
which has been handed to me.

677
00:44:36,176 --> 00:44:40,305
"After a thorough examination of the
contents of the deceased stomach,

678
00:44:40,347 --> 00:44:44,351
I conclude that he had not
had lunch, but had had a drink.

679
00:44:44,393 --> 00:44:48,355
And that the drink had been spiked
with chloral hydrate"

680
00:44:49,398 --> 00:44:52,651
a process known as
a "Mickey Finn" Your Honour.

681
00:44:52,651 --> 00:44:56,363
He'd been drugged,
before he'd been stabbed.

682
00:45:00,993 --> 00:45:03,579
Would you like to come and
have a cup of tea, dear?

683
00:45:03,579 --> 00:45:04,663
No, thank you.

684
00:45:04,663 --> 00:45:07,666
It must have been a terrible shock.

685
00:45:07,666 --> 00:45:11,920
Well, if you'd like a cup of tea, my name's
Val, and we're at number 61.

686
00:45:13,422 --> 00:45:16,383
Thank you.

687
00:45:25,767 --> 00:45:29,813
How long before he was stabbed was our
"Ms Curry" drugged with the chloral hydrate?

688
00:45:30,606 --> 00:45:33,901
The surgeon says the effect of
the drug can last up to four hours.

689
00:45:33,901 --> 00:45:37,571
So, he was almost certainly
drugged at another location,

690
00:45:37,654 --> 00:45:40,657
and then taken to number
19 Wilbraham Orescent.

691
00:45:40,657 --> 00:45:42,409
Let's talk about this, back
at the station Poirot.

692
00:45:42,409 --> 00:45:43,785
Inspector Mr Hardcastle?

693
00:45:43,785 --> 00:45:48,290
It was exactly as was said by Madame
Hemmings. "He just came here to be killed"

694
00:45:48,332 --> 00:45:49,917
- Inspector?
- What is it, Miss?

695
00:45:49,917 --> 00:45:51,126
I'd just like to speak to him.

696
00:45:51,126 --> 00:45:53,378
He's going back to the station now,
if you want to contact him there.

697
00:45:53,378 --> 00:45:55,297
- But I don't see how what she said...
- Yes, thank you madam.

698
00:45:55,297 --> 00:45:58,634
What she said couldn't possibly be true.

699
00:46:00,427 --> 00:46:03,722
If "Curry" was killed in a different location,
that puts Pebmarsh back in the frame.

700
00:46:03,722 --> 00:46:04,848
Not at all.

701
00:46:04,848 --> 00:46:07,768
Even a blind woman can stab
a drugged man in the heart.

702
00:46:07,768 --> 00:46:10,437
The time of his death is estimated
at between two and three o'clock.

703
00:46:10,437 --> 00:46:12,606
And I have literally millions of witnesses

704
00:46:12,606 --> 00:46:16,276
who saw her in the photographic
studio during that time.

705
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:20,280
I exaggerate through excitement,
obviously,

706
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:23,951
but Sheila Webb arrives there -
what do you think to this Poirot?

707
00:46:25,077 --> 00:46:27,913
Through a booking she's made
herself by ringing Martindale,

708
00:46:27,913 --> 00:46:30,499
stabs the fellow, raises the alarm.

709
00:46:30,499 --> 00:46:34,127
You didn't see how scared she was, when
she came out of that house, Hardcastle.

710
00:46:34,127 --> 00:46:35,170
Didn't I?

711
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:38,799
How she has been set up, every
step of the way. Look at this.

712
00:46:42,761 --> 00:46:44,137
Remember. 4.13.

713
00:46:44,137 --> 00:46:45,138
Hello, Jenkins.

714
00:46:45,138 --> 00:46:46,723
Someone is definitely putting
the frights on her...

715
00:46:46,723 --> 00:46:47,599
Inspector.

716
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:49,935
The only thing missing is that
it's not written in blood.

717
00:46:49,935 --> 00:46:52,396
Inspector there's a Nora Brent on
the phone would like to speak

718
00:46:52,396 --> 00:46:53,814
to you, regarding the Inquest,

719
00:46:53,814 --> 00:46:57,317
and um... and we have someone who has
an identification of the dead man.

720
00:46:57,317 --> 00:46:59,653
Tell her to ring back later.

721
00:46:59,653 --> 00:47:02,656
Ah Mr Bland, please come in.

722
00:47:02,656 --> 00:47:04,283
I'm afraid the Inspector is busy
at the moment, madam.

723
00:47:04,283 --> 00:47:08,453
I need to speak to him, because what
she said couldn't possibly be true.

724
00:47:09,496 --> 00:47:11,540
She was lying at the inquest, you see.

725
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:14,710
I'm sorry madam... but it's just
not possible at the moment.

726
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:16,086
I'm going to come round!

727
00:47:16,086 --> 00:47:19,089
I've seen this man before.

728
00:47:19,089 --> 00:47:21,508
I didn't know it, but then I saw
the girl at the inquest.

729
00:47:21,508 --> 00:47:23,218
Which girl was this?

730
00:47:23,218 --> 00:47:25,721
The girl Sheila Webb.

731
00:47:25,721 --> 00:47:29,683
I'd definitely seen her before,
it was like having a sixth sense of déja vu

732
00:47:29,725 --> 00:47:32,728
which is a feeling I've not
previously experienced.

733
00:47:32,728 --> 00:47:35,314
And where had you seen before,
the Mdms Webb?

734
00:47:35,314 --> 00:47:38,984
Well Mrs Bland and I were at the
Fine Art Fair, at the Castle Hotel.

735
00:47:39,026 --> 00:47:41,486
Now that our pockets are
a little deeper, Hardcastle,

736
00:47:41,486 --> 00:47:43,697
we get invited to things like that,

737
00:47:43,697 --> 00:47:46,783
and Sheila Webb was walking
through the foyer

738
00:47:46,783 --> 00:47:51,413
having come from upstairs.
With a man. This man.

739
00:47:52,539 --> 00:47:55,167
- When was this?
- The day before the murder.

740
00:47:55,167 --> 00:47:56,210
Are you sure?

741
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:58,128
Of course he's sure, Leftenant Race,

742
00:47:58,128 --> 00:48:01,715
it's not everyone whose judgement has
melted in the face of a pretty girl.

743
00:48:01,715 --> 00:48:04,051
What are you suggesting?

744
00:48:04,051 --> 00:48:07,721
Thank you for coming in, Mr Bland.

745
00:48:13,018 --> 00:48:15,562
I am questioning your ability
to think professionally

746
00:48:15,562 --> 00:48:19,399
about a young woman you were seen kissing,
moments before the coroner's inquest.

747
00:48:23,111 --> 00:48:25,906
Shall we go and talk to her?

748
00:48:27,866 --> 00:48:31,745
Jenkins, we need to get down to the
parade and find Miss Sheila Webb.

749
00:48:36,375 --> 00:48:37,960
You think she did it, don't you?

750
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:41,088
At this point in time, Poirot
he rules out nothing.

751
00:48:41,088 --> 00:48:45,008
Oh doesn't he? Well, I know
she isn't involved,

752
00:48:46,134 --> 00:48:48,595
I know she's a good person
who needs our help.

753
00:48:48,595 --> 00:48:53,684
The world is full of good people
who do bad things, mon ami.

754
00:49:04,278 --> 00:49:05,904
So where are you going to go?

755
00:49:05,904 --> 00:49:09,658
I don't have anywhere to go! I don't know
what I'm going to do! Don't touch me!

756
00:49:12,452 --> 00:49:15,664
Sheila. Come back inside.

757
00:49:15,664 --> 00:49:17,958
I don't want you to follow me,
because this all stops now.

758
00:49:17,958 --> 00:49:20,919
- Come back inside.
- Do you understand?

759
00:49:20,919 --> 00:49:24,590
Come back inside, Sheila.
Come on. Calm down.

760
00:49:38,103 --> 00:49:40,564
They said, she is in the telephone booth!

761
00:49:40,564 --> 00:49:41,815
AAAAARRRRGGHHH!

762
00:49:41,815 --> 00:49:44,818
Who is it, Jenkins?

763
00:49:45,319 --> 00:49:48,113
It's Nora Brent, sir. She was trying
to talk to you earlier.

764
00:49:48,113 --> 00:49:51,491
Will someone please get them
to stop hurting my girls!

765
00:49:51,491 --> 00:49:54,536
Will you get it to stop!

766
00:49:54,536 --> 00:49:57,915
Oh, Nora...

767
00:49:59,416 --> 00:50:02,669
Using her exact words, what did Nora
Brent say to you Constable?

768
00:50:02,669 --> 00:50:05,923
She said she couldn't see how what
she said could be true.

769
00:50:05,923 --> 00:50:07,382
That she was lying at the inquest.

770
00:50:07,382 --> 00:50:09,510
And this is Sheila Webb she's talking about?

771
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:11,512
- I believe so.
- But she didn't mention her name?

772
00:50:11,512 --> 00:50:14,848
Constable Jenkins, are you absolutely
certain that those were her exact words?

773
00:50:14,848 --> 00:50:18,393
- It is very important.
- I'm sure yes, I think so.

774
00:50:18,393 --> 00:50:22,356
And it was busy. Everyone
was on their way out.

775
00:50:22,856 --> 00:50:26,318
Miss Martindale, Sheila Webb
was seen with the dead man

776
00:50:26,318 --> 00:50:28,654
at the Castle Hotel,
a day before the murder.

777
00:50:28,654 --> 00:50:30,072
The Castle Hotel?

778
00:50:30,072 --> 00:50:33,784
That would be during working hours,
did she have an appointment there?

779
00:50:35,202 --> 00:50:37,955
She often has an appointment there.

780
00:50:37,955 --> 00:50:43,418
She had a regular client who
resides at the Castle Hotel.

781
00:50:44,086 --> 00:50:47,923
And I use the word "client"
with all its meaning, sir.

782
00:50:48,298 --> 00:50:53,345
Sheila Webb has a habit of inappropriate
familiarity with some of our male clients.

783
00:50:53,387 --> 00:50:57,057
A Professor Purdy especially,
who resides at The Castle hotel

784
00:50:57,099 --> 00:51:00,853
and requests her services
at least once a week.

785
00:51:02,688 --> 00:51:05,107
He's bought her gifts, I believe,

786
00:51:05,107 --> 00:51:07,568
perhaps you've noticed
the silver wristwatch,

787
00:51:07,568 --> 00:51:09,820
which a girl like Sheila
couldn't possibly afford.

788
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:11,655
Oui, mademoiselle.

789
00:51:11,655 --> 00:51:14,241
I would not be at all surprised
to hear that she had been seen

790
00:51:14,241 --> 00:51:17,369
with other gentlemen at the Castle Hotel.

791
00:51:17,369 --> 00:51:19,288
That is a disgraceful insinuation.

792
00:51:19,288 --> 00:51:22,499
Is it Leftenant? Surely, you've been
aware of the effect

793
00:51:22,499 --> 00:51:24,501
Sheila Webb has on a certain type of man.

794
00:51:24,501 --> 00:51:27,087
Tell to me if you please,
has mademoiselle Sheila Webb

795
00:51:27,087 --> 00:51:30,257
or mademoiselle Nora Brent ever worked
on the estate of Garry Gregson?

796
00:51:30,257 --> 00:51:33,844
Not again! Who cares about
"Garry ruddy Gregson",

797
00:51:33,844 --> 00:51:37,848
can't you see the case that
is building in front of you here?

798
00:51:38,682 --> 00:51:42,102
Non Monsieur,
I deal with all matters Gregson.

799
00:51:42,102 --> 00:51:44,438
Merci mademoiselle.

800
00:51:44,438 --> 00:51:45,397
Come on.

801
00:51:45,397 --> 00:51:46,690
Where is it that you go, Inspector?

802
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:49,985
To show the dead man's photograph
to the Castle staff, of course.

803
00:51:49,985 --> 00:51:51,361
- Are you coming?
- Non.

804
00:51:51,361 --> 00:51:52,946
- No.
- Non.

805
00:51:52,946 --> 00:51:56,658
I don't even begin to understand you, Poirot.

806
00:51:59,536 --> 00:52:02,748
- Evening, sir.
- Evening.

807
00:52:05,501 --> 00:52:06,960
What news have you got for me, Race?

808
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:10,464
Well I ran checks on the residents
and neighbours of 61

809
00:52:10,464 --> 00:52:13,509
Wilbraham Orescent as well as I can,
and there seems to be...

810
00:52:13,509 --> 00:52:15,302
And what did you find?

811
00:52:15,302 --> 00:52:19,181
Not much, if the truth be told.
The Blands have come into money,

812
00:52:19,473 --> 00:52:21,892
but as you can see from these
bank transactions

813
00:52:21,892 --> 00:52:25,812
it's genuinely an inheritance
from Canada.

814
00:52:28,398 --> 00:52:30,734
Christopher Mabbutt next door is
of interest to us because

815
00:52:30,734 --> 00:52:33,320
he travels extensively on the continent...

816
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:36,740
Yes Mabbutt works for Armstrong
Ordnance doesn't he,

817
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:38,909
who supply the French army with weapons.

818
00:52:38,909 --> 00:52:42,746
- He does.
- So not your usual German spy.

819
00:52:43,205 --> 00:52:44,206
No.

820
00:52:44,206 --> 00:52:46,166
- Anything else?
- Not as yet.

821
00:52:46,166 --> 00:52:49,628
Does this second murder on the Parade have
anything to do with Wilbraham Orescent?

822
00:52:49,628 --> 00:52:52,589
- Yes.
- In what way?

823
00:52:52,589 --> 00:52:54,091
I, I don't know.

824
00:52:54,091 --> 00:52:56,510
You don't know much, do you Leftenant?

825
00:52:56,510 --> 00:52:58,804
- Does Poirot?
- Not yet.

826
00:52:58,804 --> 00:53:03,559
Maybe this business in Wilbraham Orescent
has nothing to do with the leak

827
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:06,478
and Fiona Hanbury's death.

828
00:53:06,478 --> 00:53:08,146
Maybe you're wrong Lieutenant.

829
00:53:08,146 --> 00:53:10,399
I don't think so, sir.

830
00:53:10,399 --> 00:53:12,317
Well you have one more day,

831
00:53:12,317 --> 00:53:16,154
and then I will bring in other agents,
do you understand?

832
00:53:34,089 --> 00:53:37,009
Is that mine?

833
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:40,929
Yes.

834
00:53:40,929 --> 00:53:43,849
Where did you find it?

835
00:53:45,309 --> 00:53:46,685
I'm sorry I wasn't there for you.

836
00:53:46,685 --> 00:53:48,937
What do you mean?

837
00:53:48,937 --> 00:53:50,355
On the night you died.

838
00:53:50,355 --> 00:53:52,983
Let me get my hat and my coat.

839
00:53:52,983 --> 00:53:54,484
Let's go down the Bluebell,

840
00:53:54,484 --> 00:53:57,362
and then let's go to my house. All right?

841
00:53:57,362 --> 00:54:00,866
- All right.
- Stay here.

842
00:54:31,021 --> 00:54:32,022
Do you recognise him?

843
00:54:32,022 --> 00:54:34,441
Has he been in the Hotel
any time in the past week?

844
00:54:34,441 --> 00:54:37,444
I don't think so.

845
00:54:37,444 --> 00:54:41,365
Possibly accompanied by a young lady,
a miss Sheila Webb.

846
00:54:42,616 --> 00:54:46,203
I cannot believe that poor girl was
murdered in broad daylight,

847
00:54:46,203 --> 00:54:51,416
where anyone could have seen.
It sounds a most desperate crime.

848
00:54:51,458 --> 00:54:55,212
Oui. Most desperate indeed.

849
00:54:56,755 --> 00:55:00,467
Tell to me if you please,
after the inquest

850
00:55:00,717 --> 00:55:02,928
did mademoiselle Nora Brent
say anything to you?

851
00:55:02,928 --> 00:55:04,930
No, why would she?

852
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:06,974
So you did not know her at all?

853
00:55:06,974 --> 00:55:11,353
She had not made, perhaps, a visit to
the studio here, with a sweetheart?

854
00:55:12,437 --> 00:55:15,148
I don't recognise the name,
but it's possible.

855
00:55:15,148 --> 00:55:18,360
Appointments are usually
made in the man's name.

856
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:21,947
You're welcome to look, Mr Wright keeps
copies of every photograph

857
00:55:21,947 --> 00:55:25,617
he's ever taken and he's been
here over thirty years.

858
00:55:25,826 --> 00:55:28,829
Merci mademoiselle. But I do not
think that will be necessary.

859
00:55:28,829 --> 00:55:31,415
Does Ms Wright develop
his own portraits?

860
00:55:31,415 --> 00:55:33,000
Oh yes, he does everything here.

861
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,170
If he sends out to a lab, the results
are never as professional.

862
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:38,547
Oui, d'accord.

863
00:55:38,547 --> 00:55:42,634
Ah, Pedmarsh, so you have
had taken your own portrait?

864
00:55:45,179 --> 00:55:48,015
No monsieur,

865
00:55:48,682 --> 00:55:51,185
these are my sons.

866
00:55:51,185 --> 00:55:54,396
They passed through here during the war,
and sent a portrait back to me.

867
00:55:54,396 --> 00:55:59,568
- They are most handsome.
- Yes, they were. They were.

868
00:56:01,612 --> 00:56:06,783
I volunteered for service after I lost them,
and then, after the war, came here.

869
00:56:07,659 --> 00:56:11,663
And it pains me to think monsieur,
that if this peace does not hold

870
00:56:11,705 --> 00:56:15,375
there will soon be another generation
of boys in these files,

871
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:21,048
who send photos back to their
parents, but never get home.

872
00:56:33,310 --> 00:56:36,021
Hello.

873
00:56:42,528 --> 00:56:43,612
Where have you been?

874
00:56:43,612 --> 00:56:47,282
Can I be with you tonight?

875
00:56:58,335 --> 00:57:01,088
Ah, Poirot, just in time to help.

876
00:57:01,088 --> 00:57:04,967
We've had over two hundred responses to the
picture of the dead man in the paper.

877
00:57:05,008 --> 00:57:07,678
We're trying to cross-reference them
to see if the same name keeps

878
00:57:07,678 --> 00:57:10,055
coming up, or the photograph fits.

879
00:57:10,055 --> 00:57:12,474
Could they not identify
him at the Castle Hotel?

880
00:57:12,474 --> 00:57:16,395
No, nothing. They knew Sheila Webb
and Professor Purdy,

881
00:57:17,187 --> 00:57:19,982
but I think the Blands must have
seen them and got mistaken,

882
00:57:19,982 --> 00:57:23,402
too eager to help. Do you agree?

883
00:57:23,402 --> 00:57:25,863
Non...

884
00:57:25,863 --> 00:57:30,325
I don't think it's important
who he is, but who he is.

885
00:57:31,785 --> 00:57:34,663
Right, well I'm not going
to rise to that one.

886
00:57:34,663 --> 00:57:38,041
- Bonsoir.
- Oh, the clocks, Poirot,

887
00:57:38,041 --> 00:57:41,503
all bought from the same stall in Deal
market, within the last month,

888
00:57:41,503 --> 00:57:45,257
no ID on the buyer though,
all bought there except the...

889
00:57:45,299 --> 00:57:49,636
- The Rosemary clock.
- Yes. The Rosemary.

890
00:57:49,678 --> 00:57:52,556
Just as I thought.

891
00:57:52,556 --> 00:57:55,601
Thank you, Inspector.

892
00:57:58,896 --> 00:58:02,566
It's not important who he is,
but who he is.

893
00:58:03,525 --> 00:58:06,570
Not important who he is, but who he is.

894
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:09,740
Anyone understand that?

895
00:58:40,479 --> 00:58:43,774
Most extraordinary.

896
00:59:00,791 --> 00:59:05,796
Forgive me, but unless I am mistaken,
you must be Professor Purdy?

897
00:59:19,643 --> 00:59:23,105
Where did you go, after the Inquest?

898
00:59:26,942 --> 00:59:29,987
I want the truth.

899
00:59:33,073 --> 00:59:35,826
For a walk on the front.

900
00:59:37,202 --> 00:59:40,414
It could easily have been me who
made the call to Miss Pebmarsh.

901
00:59:40,414 --> 00:59:43,333
Easily me who killed that man,
I could've done it all.

902
00:59:43,333 --> 00:59:47,004
And there's no proof that it wasn't.

903
00:59:47,004 --> 00:59:50,549
I just needed time to think what to do.

904
00:59:50,716 --> 00:59:54,761
But when I made my way back
to work I saw Nora was dead.

905
00:59:56,138 --> 00:59:59,224
I knew I'd be blamed for that as well.

906
00:59:59,224 --> 01:00:03,103
I left Dover this afternoon,
and wasn't going to come back,

907
01:00:03,437 --> 01:00:04,855
which would have been bad.

908
01:00:04,855 --> 01:00:07,566
Yes it would.

909
01:00:07,566 --> 01:00:09,818
You need to see the Police
and clear your name.

910
01:00:09,818 --> 01:00:15,532
Yes I know. You believe I'm innocent
don't you, you believe it wasn't me.

911
01:00:22,122 --> 01:00:24,208
I'm going to get us both a drink.

912
01:00:24,208 --> 01:00:27,336
There's glasses in the kitchenette.

913
01:00:48,232 --> 01:00:51,026
These small ones?

914
01:00:51,902 --> 01:00:54,780
Yes.

915
01:00:59,076 --> 01:01:01,161
When did you get this?

916
01:01:01,161 --> 01:01:04,206
- I...
- When did you get it?

917
01:01:04,748 --> 01:01:05,582
Colin, I -

918
01:01:05,582 --> 01:01:08,877
I'm taking you with me
to the police station now.

919
01:01:08,877 --> 01:01:12,256
Now.

920
01:01:12,714 --> 01:01:15,759
Where did you get the murder weapon?

921
01:01:17,803 --> 01:01:21,557
All right.
Where did you get the clock?

922
01:01:23,559 --> 01:01:25,894
Unless I'm mistaken, Inspector,

923
01:01:25,894 --> 01:01:29,690
Mademoiselle Webb received
the clock when she was a child

924
01:01:30,399 --> 01:01:34,111
for her birthday.
Or was it Ohristmas perhaps?

925
01:01:35,404 --> 01:01:37,781
When I was born.

926
01:01:37,781 --> 01:01:41,660
The home told me it was a gift from
my mother, who I never knew.

927
01:01:42,286 --> 01:01:43,453
What are you talking about?

928
01:01:43,453 --> 01:01:46,331
Rosemary is the first name of Mdms Webb,

929
01:01:46,331 --> 01:01:49,001
is that not so?

930
01:01:49,001 --> 01:01:52,379
- Mdms RS Webb.
- Yes.

931
01:01:52,379 --> 01:01:58,093
Rosemary Sheila - and yet you choose
to use your second name, non?

932
01:02:00,179 --> 01:02:03,682
- May I continue?
- Oui. Bien sure.

933
01:02:03,682 --> 01:02:06,518
Pardon.

934
01:02:06,894 --> 01:02:10,564
If the clock was yours, what was
it doing at Miss Pebmarsh's house?

935
01:02:11,815 --> 01:02:15,569
She does not know, Inspector
which is why she stole it.

936
01:02:24,995 --> 01:02:28,457
The spring it is broken, n'est-ce pas?
So it is possible that a few weeks

937
01:02:28,457 --> 01:02:31,919
previously you took it to the
jewellers to have it repaired?

938
01:02:31,919 --> 01:02:35,422
And then, oui, you lost it.

939
01:02:35,422 --> 01:02:39,676
And the next time you see it, it is
at number 19 Wilbraham Orescent.

940
01:02:41,053 --> 01:02:44,848
And there is there a dead man.
The police, they are everywhere.

941
01:02:45,974 --> 01:02:50,145
And so you think to yourself - why is
someone trying to frame me for murder?

942
01:02:50,187 --> 01:02:53,982
And then you notice that all
the clocks they spell 4.13,

943
01:02:53,982 --> 01:02:57,903
the number of the very room in
the hotel where, in your loneliness

944
01:02:57,945 --> 01:03:01,865
you have begun a love affair with
a man who does not care for you.

945
01:03:03,909 --> 01:03:08,705
And so you think to yourself why is
someone trying to expose my shame?

946
01:03:09,915 --> 01:03:12,918
You do not know.

947
01:03:13,168 --> 01:03:16,755
And the knife? I suspect that you
have never seen this before,

948
01:03:16,755 --> 01:03:19,550
or else almost certainly
you would have got rid of it.

949
01:03:19,550 --> 01:03:21,385
Inspector, may I ask a question?

950
01:03:21,385 --> 01:03:25,055
Of course, will you be answering it as well?

951
01:03:25,055 --> 01:03:28,684
Mademoiselle, when you returned
from lunch on the day of the murder,

952
01:03:28,684 --> 01:03:31,144
mademoiselle Nora Brent,
what was she doing?

953
01:03:31,144 --> 01:03:35,023
- Talking. Nora was always talking.
- About what?

954
01:03:35,107 --> 01:03:38,735
I strut off to lunch and the heel snaps
off in a grate like a twig in a storm.

955
01:03:38,735 --> 01:03:42,406
So now we make the progress.

956
01:03:42,489 --> 01:03:46,827
And in which grate was it did mademoiselle
Nora Brent break her shoe?

957
01:03:46,869 --> 01:03:51,164
Yes, which was it, let's bring the
grate in for questioning shall we?

958
01:03:51,206 --> 01:03:53,625
Inspector. As you told to me only yesterday,

959
01:03:53,625 --> 01:03:56,378
can not you see the case that
is building in front of you?

960
01:03:56,378 --> 01:03:59,089
Not the case about the grate, no!

961
01:03:59,089 --> 01:04:01,675
I don't know which grate it was, sir.

962
01:04:01,675 --> 01:04:04,887
She's here, Inspector.

963
01:04:05,512 --> 01:04:06,471
Who's here?

964
01:04:06,471 --> 01:04:10,309
One name came up five times
in response to the newspapers.

965
01:04:11,268 --> 01:04:15,564
Then the dead man's widow rings up and says
she wants to come in to identify the body.

966
01:04:17,316 --> 01:04:21,153
His name's Harry Castleton.

967
01:04:26,450 --> 01:04:30,370
Put this one back in her cell Constable,
this is far from over.

968
01:04:45,052 --> 01:04:47,804
That's him. That's Harry.

969
01:04:47,804 --> 01:04:51,266
When's the last time you saw
your husband, Mrs Castleton?

970
01:04:51,266 --> 01:04:55,103
Fifteen years ago. And he wasn't
much of a husband.

971
01:04:55,521 --> 01:04:58,815
I don't even know if Castleton
was his real name.

972
01:04:58,815 --> 01:05:02,861
He said he was in Insurance. But that was
just a ruse so he could travel

973
01:05:02,903 --> 01:05:06,156
around and run scams on lonely women.

974
01:05:06,156 --> 01:05:09,868
I gave him the heave-ho when I discovered
that he was engaged to that...

975
01:05:12,329 --> 01:05:18,919
schoolteacher she was. But by then
he had taken me for all my savings.

976
01:05:20,003 --> 01:05:22,631
Did your husband have any
distinguishing marks?

977
01:05:22,631 --> 01:05:26,510
No. Yes he did, behind his left ear.

978
01:05:27,594 --> 01:05:31,640
He cut himself shaving once,
made a terrible mess in the sink.

979
01:05:33,684 --> 01:05:36,019
Thank you for coming Mrs Castleton.

980
01:05:36,019 --> 01:05:40,190
I don't use that name now.
My name is Rival, Merlina Rival.

981
01:05:40,732 --> 01:05:43,694
It was my stage name before
I ever met my husband

982
01:05:43,694 --> 01:05:46,655
and I reverted to it the moment
he disappeared.

983
01:05:46,655 --> 01:05:50,534
This murder gets more complicated
by the minute.

984
01:05:50,659 --> 01:05:54,329
Mais oui. Which can only
mean one thing, mon ami.

985
01:05:55,372 --> 01:05:59,751
The solution it must be very simple.

986
01:06:01,211 --> 01:06:02,880
Where are you going?

987
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:06,550
I feel it is necessary to speak once
again to the cat lady.

988
01:06:07,426 --> 01:06:11,471
- Madame Hemmings.
- Why?

989
01:06:11,972 --> 01:06:16,101
What an excitement everybody, the big
French Tom's paying us another visit.

990
01:06:16,143 --> 01:06:17,269
I am Belgian madame.

991
01:06:17,269 --> 01:06:20,856
Please sit yourself down, although
you might find the sofa a little damp

992
01:06:20,856 --> 01:06:24,443
because Tiddly-pops is sometimes
tiddly by name as well as by nature,

993
01:06:24,443 --> 01:06:28,071
would you like me to fold up a bath
towel and put it on the seat.

994
01:06:28,071 --> 01:06:31,617
The dampness takes time
to seep through then I find.

995
01:06:31,617 --> 01:06:35,329
Madame, you told to me I think that
in the garden the other evening

996
01:06:35,996 --> 01:06:41,293
you overheard hard words pass between
Ms Mabbutt and Mdms Pebmarsh.

997
01:06:41,335 --> 01:06:44,463
- Yes.
- Why was that unusual?

998
01:06:44,463 --> 01:06:46,465
Well because he's never there.

999
01:06:46,465 --> 01:06:49,468
And when he is he's very polite,
a lovely man,

1000
01:06:49,468 --> 01:06:53,430
it's that bad-tempered Nanny everyone
usually has ding-dongs with.

1001
01:06:53,472 --> 01:06:55,224
Can you remember what was said?

1002
01:06:55,224 --> 01:06:58,852
Well, you were there weren't you Copey?

1003
01:06:59,102 --> 01:07:00,812
We need to do it now, Mr Mabbutt!

1004
01:07:00,812 --> 01:07:03,482
Not with them swarming
all over the place no.

1005
01:07:03,482 --> 01:07:07,486
It will all be wasted
if we don't act now!

1006
01:07:07,486 --> 01:07:08,946
She was talking about her plants...

1007
01:07:08,946 --> 01:07:12,199
I imagine, the way those girls
trample all over them.

1008
01:07:12,199 --> 01:07:15,077
And this discussion, did it take
place the evening after the body

1009
01:07:15,077 --> 01:07:17,788
was discovered in the sitting
room of Mdms Pebmarsh?

1010
01:07:17,788 --> 01:07:23,126
No, it was Wednesday, because we'd all just
enjoyed "Band Wagon" on the wireless.

1011
01:07:23,168 --> 01:07:25,712
But it was Wednesday that
the body was discovered.

1012
01:07:25,712 --> 01:07:29,591
No Tuesday. Thank you, yes, because
I noticed the laundry van

1013
01:07:29,633 --> 01:07:34,179
pull up to her house at lunchtime,
the laundry always arrives on Tuesday.

1014
01:07:48,527 --> 01:07:52,573
Monsieur hello. Hello.

1015
01:07:53,073 --> 01:07:55,242
- Hello?
- Mrs Bland.

1016
01:07:55,242 --> 01:07:58,871
Ah Madame Bland!

1017
01:07:59,204 --> 01:08:03,000
I hear on the jungle drums that
you've identified the dead man?

1018
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:05,669
Well shall we say the police
they are confident.

1019
01:08:05,669 --> 01:08:07,588
- That's wonderful.
- Yes, indeed.

1020
01:08:07,588 --> 01:08:11,216
Oh, tell to me if you please madame,
from where in Canada are you?

1021
01:08:11,258 --> 01:08:16,054
It is simply that I have some friends in
Montreal and I wondered if you knew them.

1022
01:08:16,096 --> 01:08:18,557
Oh not the French speaking part no.

1023
01:08:18,557 --> 01:08:21,393
Edmonton it was. Alberta.

1024
01:08:21,393 --> 01:08:23,812
Je suis desole. How foolish of me.

1025
01:08:23,812 --> 01:08:27,482
Did you find that when you were coming
over here that everyone would say to you -

1026
01:08:28,192 --> 01:08:33,405
"I know someone in England, Newcastle,
please to say hello"?

1027
01:08:33,447 --> 01:08:36,241
- Oh yes people can be so silly.
- Oui!

1028
01:08:36,241 --> 01:08:39,995
But it was natural for me to settle in Dover
because this is where my sister lives.

1029
01:08:40,329 --> 01:08:43,207
- As well as meeting Joe here.
- But of course.

1030
01:08:43,207 --> 01:08:46,960
Well I'll let you get on monsieur, but that's
wonderful news about the identification.

1031
01:08:47,002 --> 01:08:50,797
Yes, indeed. Madame.

1032
01:08:56,386 --> 01:08:58,639
We did what you asked.
Do you want to come and see.

1033
01:08:58,639 --> 01:09:01,391
Oui.

1034
01:09:01,391 --> 01:09:05,646
Madameoiselle Jenny, mademoiselle May,
tell to me what is it you have found.

1035
01:09:05,687 --> 01:09:07,523
- Coins.
- Coins?

1036
01:09:07,523 --> 01:09:09,149
About two and six.

1037
01:09:09,149 --> 01:09:10,651
Ah but that's very good.

1038
01:09:10,651 --> 01:09:13,195
And you found all this in the garden
of mademoiselle Pebmarsh?

1039
01:09:13,195 --> 01:09:14,780
But you haven't seen
the best thing yet.

1040
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:16,782
But that was in our garden not hers.

1041
01:09:16,782 --> 01:09:20,077
What is the best thing?

1042
01:09:21,328 --> 01:09:25,082
S'il te plait? Merci.

1043
01:09:42,724 --> 01:09:45,853
You may have known him under
a name other than Castleton.

1044
01:09:45,853 --> 01:09:47,396
No sir, no.

1045
01:09:47,396 --> 01:09:51,316
And he was putting pressure on you for
money maybe, maybe he was blackmailing...

1046
01:09:51,358 --> 01:09:54,444
Sir. It's Poirot.

1047
01:09:56,989 --> 01:09:57,990
Hardcastle.

1048
01:09:57,990 --> 01:10:01,118
Inspector it is a matter of urgency

1049
01:10:01,118 --> 01:10:04,371
that you dispatch but immediately
a telegram to Somerset House.

1050
01:10:04,371 --> 01:10:09,459
It is also a matter of urgency that
I continue to interview my prime suspect,

1051
01:10:09,501 --> 01:10:12,504
so will you go away for ten blinking minutes?

1052
01:10:12,504 --> 01:10:16,300
Non, and you must release
mademoiselle Sheila Webb.

1053
01:10:16,341 --> 01:10:17,885
Release her?

1054
01:10:17,885 --> 01:10:20,387
Oui. It is evident to Poirot
that she is not guilty,

1055
01:10:20,387 --> 01:10:22,931
but I will need her help to prove it.

1056
01:10:22,931 --> 01:10:25,475
Also, I will need to speak
to her over the telephone

1057
01:10:25,475 --> 01:10:29,062
but immediately after I have given
you instructions for Somerset House.

1058
01:10:29,062 --> 01:10:30,522
What is going on Poirot?

1059
01:10:30,522 --> 01:10:32,983
I will tell to you everything
that Poirot has discovered,

1060
01:10:32,983 --> 01:10:35,694
but you must promise to release
Mademoiselle Sheila Webb

1061
01:10:35,694 --> 01:10:39,448
and act according to my instructions.

1062
01:10:40,115 --> 01:10:41,950
- Go on.
- You must get Somerset House

1063
01:10:42,159 --> 01:10:45,537
to verify the marriage record
of Harry Castleton

1064
01:10:45,746 --> 01:10:48,165
to mademoiselle Merlina Rival,

1065
01:10:48,165 --> 01:10:51,460
and you must also get them
to verify something else for me.

1066
01:10:52,544 --> 01:10:54,755
This is Annabel Larkin's I'm sure.

1067
01:10:54,755 --> 01:10:58,050
It was found in the Mabat's garden?

1068
01:10:58,050 --> 01:11:01,386
Also I learnt from his daughters
that this afternoon

1069
01:11:01,428 --> 01:11:04,765
he intends to travel to France.
You must prevent this.

1070
01:11:04,765 --> 01:11:06,725
No, you've got the wrong end of the stick.

1071
01:11:06,725 --> 01:11:10,646
Trawling through the histories
of the neighbours we found this:

1072
01:11:10,979 --> 01:11:13,524
The Waterhouses, with their
perfect English name,

1073
01:11:13,524 --> 01:11:16,109
their perfect English voices, are German.

1074
01:11:16,109 --> 01:11:21,281
They came over in 1936 from Munich.
They changed their name from Tuchman.

1075
01:11:21,323 --> 01:11:24,493
But of course they are German,

1076
01:11:24,493 --> 01:11:26,703
did you not notice the slips
in the way they spoke?

1077
01:11:26,703 --> 01:11:29,331
We like this street
because it's quiet also.

1078
01:11:29,331 --> 01:11:33,377
The use of the word "also"
at the end of the sentence.

1079
01:11:34,127 --> 01:11:38,048
A mistake most common in even the most
fluent German when they speak English.

1080
01:11:38,507 --> 01:11:40,676
Well why didn't you say?

1081
01:11:40,676 --> 01:11:43,303
Because they cannot
be connected Leftenant.

1082
01:11:43,303 --> 01:11:46,849
Maybe they buried this in Mabbutt's
garden to draw us away...

1083
01:11:46,849 --> 01:11:49,726
Non, non. Monsieur Mabbutt
and Mademoiselle Pebmarsh

1084
01:11:49,726 --> 01:11:52,396
were overheard
on the evening of the murder.

1085
01:11:52,396 --> 01:11:54,565
You need to do it now, Mr Mabbutt!

1086
01:11:54,565 --> 01:11:57,067
with them swarming
all over the place no!

1087
01:11:57,067 --> 01:12:00,028
It will all be wasted if we don't act now!

1088
01:12:00,028 --> 01:12:03,323
It was presumed that they were
arguing about the children.

1089
01:12:03,323 --> 01:12:06,410
But non, Poirot thinks not.
Poirot suspects

1090
01:12:06,410 --> 01:12:06,743
that they were talking

1091
01:12:06,869 --> 01:12:09,496
about the police that were now
in the neighbourhood

1092
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:11,957
and the importance of getting
the stolen documents

1093
01:12:11,957 --> 01:12:13,917
to their contact on the continent.

1094
01:12:13,917 --> 01:12:16,837
- Miss Pebmarsh?
- Consider this.

1095
01:12:16,837 --> 01:12:20,674
The note that was made by mademoiselle
Fiona on the night she followed Larkin.

1096
01:12:20,674 --> 01:12:22,593
It would have been made in haste hein?

1097
01:12:22,593 --> 01:12:26,805
A piece of paper, pulled from
her handbag, a scribble.

1098
01:12:32,227 --> 01:12:34,313
What does it mean?

1099
01:12:34,313 --> 01:12:36,106
Number 61? No-one knows what it means.

1100
01:12:36,106 --> 01:12:39,943
Exactement, mon ami, exactement,
so if you please?

1101
01:12:40,027 --> 01:12:43,780
Perhaps Poirot is correct
when he does this.

1102
01:12:47,868 --> 01:12:50,495
19 Wilbraham Orescent.

1103
01:12:50,495 --> 01:12:53,749
Mademoiselle Pebmarsh.

1104
01:13:05,511 --> 01:13:08,013
Oan I ask you where you're
going please Mr Mabbutt?

1105
01:13:08,013 --> 01:13:11,016
- Why are you asking?
- Routine.

1106
01:13:11,016 --> 01:13:14,770
Well I'm taking the Calais ferry
in three quarters of an hour,

1107
01:13:14,811 --> 01:13:18,482
and have business in France for
the next three days. Good day to you.

1108
01:13:18,524 --> 01:13:21,693
Will you step over
to the car please, sir.

1109
01:13:21,693 --> 01:13:24,780
Just a minute of your time.

1110
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:27,032
What is the meaning of this Leftenant?

1111
01:13:27,032 --> 01:13:30,786
Bear with us sir. I apologise
for the inconvenience.

1112
01:13:38,585 --> 01:13:39,670
Good afternoon.

1113
01:13:39,670 --> 01:13:43,715
Good afternoon Mademoiselle,
it is I, Hercule Poirot.

1114
01:13:44,633 --> 01:13:47,928
And what can I do for you, Monsieur.

1115
01:13:47,928 --> 01:13:51,723
Eh bien, mademoiselle I have reason
to believe that Mademoiselle Nora Brent

1116
01:13:52,182 --> 01:13:54,852
may have visited the studio
here to have a photograph

1117
01:13:54,852 --> 01:13:57,271
taken with a gentleman,
and I wondered if I might take

1118
01:13:57,271 --> 01:14:00,482
you up on your offer most kind
to have a look through your records.

1119
01:14:00,482 --> 01:14:02,401
Of course.

1120
01:14:02,401 --> 01:14:06,572
Not knowing the gentleman's name I suppose
it would be best if you were to start

1121
01:14:06,613 --> 01:14:09,491
at the beginning of the alphabet
and work your way through.

1122
01:14:09,491 --> 01:14:10,659
Oui d'accord.

1123
01:14:10,659 --> 01:14:13,954
Then you should begin here.

1124
01:14:13,954 --> 01:14:16,874
Merci.

1125
01:14:21,628 --> 01:14:23,881
Fine weather for a crossing today sir.

1126
01:14:23,881 --> 01:14:27,050
How long is this going to take?

1127
01:14:27,384 --> 01:14:30,554
Just a few minutes more.

1128
01:14:33,932 --> 01:14:36,977
What have we here?

1129
01:14:39,771 --> 01:14:42,858
Get off me!

1130
01:14:55,245 --> 01:14:58,624
Would you like a cup of tea, monsieur?

1131
01:14:58,624 --> 01:15:02,336
Non, non, non, merci mademoiselle.
I think I have found what I am looking for.

1132
01:15:02,377 --> 01:15:04,379
Already?

1133
01:15:04,379 --> 01:15:06,215
Oui.

1134
01:15:06,215 --> 01:15:10,052
I thought that the sweetheart of
Mademoiselle Nora Brent had a name

1135
01:15:10,093 --> 01:15:14,890
at the beginning of the alphabet
and luck it has struck.

1136
01:15:18,685 --> 01:15:21,271
Millicent Pebmarsh, I am Leftenant
Race of the Royal Navy

1137
01:15:21,271 --> 01:15:24,942
and I am arresting you under
suspicion of high treason.

1138
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:28,237
Will you please accompany me?

1139
01:15:31,490 --> 01:15:35,410
So let's have another one then,
come on.

1140
01:15:35,410 --> 01:15:37,246
Mrs Rival?

1141
01:15:37,246 --> 01:15:39,873
Oh hello, I've said everything I had to say

1142
01:15:39,873 --> 01:15:43,544
and I'm back to London on the
two-fifteen so thanking you.

1143
01:15:43,919 --> 01:15:45,254
Ohin-Ohin.

1144
01:15:45,254 --> 01:15:49,174
Can I ask when Harry Castleton
cut himself shaving?

1145
01:15:49,174 --> 01:15:51,885
Well I don't know when.
When we were together.

1146
01:15:51,885 --> 01:15:53,095
Fifteen years ago?

1147
01:15:53,095 --> 01:15:56,014
I told you I haven't seen him for
fifteen years, didn't you take notes?

1148
01:15:56,014 --> 01:15:58,475
The police surgeon tells me that
it's a much more recent scar.

1149
01:15:58,475 --> 01:16:02,020
Perhaps only two years old.

1150
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:06,441
Well I remember him doing it, so your
police surgeon is incorrect, your honour.

1151
01:16:07,025 --> 01:16:09,695
Mrs Rival, you know that perverting
the course of justice carries

1152
01:16:09,695 --> 01:16:12,406
a maximum prison sentence
of four years?

1153
01:16:12,406 --> 01:16:14,825
Which is why I don't do it.

1154
01:16:14,825 --> 01:16:17,995
Is this your correct address in London?

1155
01:16:17,995 --> 01:16:19,997
I believe it is, yes.

1156
01:16:19,997 --> 01:16:22,958
Good.

1157
01:16:35,762 --> 01:16:39,433
Oh, Sheila. Nice to have you back.

1158
01:16:39,808 --> 01:16:42,561
I've been typing up some of the work
that Nora left unfinished

1159
01:16:42,561 --> 01:16:45,439
on "Naked Love"; now that you're
back perhaps you could take it over.

1160
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:47,065
Of course, Miss Martindale.

1161
01:16:47,065 --> 01:16:51,028
Well, the manuscript's in my office.
It's lunchtime girls.

1162
01:16:51,945 --> 01:16:55,616
Quite an operation you had going here.

1163
01:16:56,533 --> 01:17:00,037
Larkin would steal the documents.

1164
01:17:01,205 --> 01:17:04,541
Pebmarsh would make a copy.

1165
01:17:04,541 --> 01:17:07,878
And Mabbutt would make
a drop somewhere in France.

1166
01:17:07,878 --> 01:17:11,757
And all of you recruited
by the Waterhouse's.

1167
01:17:11,798 --> 01:17:13,425
Non, Leftenant.

1168
01:17:13,425 --> 01:17:15,302
The Waterhouses?

1169
01:17:15,469 --> 01:17:17,930
You were doing quite
well until you mentioned that scum.

1170
01:17:19,973 --> 01:17:22,601
Excuse me.

1171
01:17:26,438 --> 01:17:28,982
- What are we doing here?
- Are we under arrest?

1172
01:17:28,982 --> 01:17:31,652
Why did you change your name
from Tuchman to Waterhouse,

1173
01:17:31,652 --> 01:17:35,280
why are you living in England
under false identities?

1174
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:38,492
- Weil wir Juden sind!
- What?

1175
01:17:38,492 --> 01:17:41,537
We are Jewish!

1176
01:17:41,537 --> 01:17:44,623
But this is England, why are you
disguising the fact you're Jewish?

1177
01:17:44,623 --> 01:17:48,710
Do you think that anti-Semitism doesn't
exist here as well Leftenant?

1178
01:17:48,752 --> 01:17:52,047
This is our third English city
in two years!

1179
01:17:52,047 --> 01:17:54,383
When you have lived through what
we did in Munich Leftenant,

1180
01:17:54,383 --> 01:17:56,343
at the first sign of it you move on.

1181
01:17:56,343 --> 01:18:02,599
All we want is to live our lives quietly,
without threat, without prejudice!

1182
01:18:10,023 --> 01:18:14,444
The irony is Leftenant, it's in our
country's interests to have peace

1183
01:18:14,486 --> 01:18:19,032
with Germany. To stop the communists
creeping ever westward.

1184
01:18:20,117 --> 01:18:24,121
We are patriots who pass
information to Hitler,

1185
01:18:24,162 --> 01:18:26,915
because if Chamberlain's policy
of appeasement doesn't hold

1186
01:18:26,915 --> 01:18:30,169
and someone like Churchill gets
his hands on power

1187
01:18:30,169 --> 01:18:34,131
we will be dragged into a war a hundred
times worse than the last one.

1188
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:37,759
And in that scenario the quicker
Germany knocks out

1189
01:18:37,759 --> 01:18:40,971
a weak liberal England
the better for all Europe.

1190
01:18:40,971 --> 01:18:44,099
Or what would remain
of Europe under the Nazis.

1191
01:18:44,099 --> 01:18:47,394
Monsieur you have not seen your
country overrun by foreign tyranny.

1192
01:18:47,394 --> 01:18:50,397
I have. And I tell you monsieur

1193
01:18:50,397 --> 01:18:53,734
that I value the weak liberal
England, as you call it,

1194
01:18:53,734 --> 01:18:56,945
as a country well worth the fighting for.

1195
01:18:56,945 --> 01:19:00,115
But you won't do the fighting,
will you Monsieur?

1196
01:19:00,115 --> 01:19:02,451
It will be the young boys again.

1197
01:19:02,451 --> 01:19:05,913
And if I can save one life by keeping
this country weak

1198
01:19:05,913 --> 01:19:09,708
so it cannot engage in war with Germany,

1199
01:19:09,833 --> 01:19:13,003
then I will be proud of what I have done.

1200
01:19:13,003 --> 01:19:15,797
Fiona Hanbury had a life.

1201
01:19:15,797 --> 01:19:19,259
I think people like that are
called collateral Leftenant.

1202
01:19:19,259 --> 01:19:21,220
They die for a greater good.

1203
01:19:21,220 --> 01:19:24,431
Please! Stop!

1204
01:19:29,686 --> 01:19:33,732
The man found dead in Miss Pebmarsh's
sitting room also had a life Mabbutt,

1205
01:19:34,233 --> 01:19:36,527
as did the secretary Nora Brent.

1206
01:19:36,527 --> 01:19:39,571
No sir, Monsieur Poirot and
I don't believe those deaths

1207
01:19:39,571 --> 01:19:41,323
had anything to do with these people.

1208
01:19:41,323 --> 01:19:45,118
In fact if we're correct Inspector
Hardcastle is, at this moment,

1209
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:48,539
making an arrest in that
murder investigation.

1210
01:19:48,539 --> 01:19:51,667
He practically put a black cap on
his head and gave me five years,

1211
01:19:51,667 --> 01:19:55,420
I'm not going to go to prison
for four years, I won't do it.

1212
01:19:57,548 --> 01:20:01,426
Well I want more money, more than
the two hundred, no, I want more.

1213
01:20:03,762 --> 01:20:07,766
All right I know where that is,
I'll meet you there.

1214
01:20:09,601 --> 01:20:10,936
Where do you think she's heading?

1215
01:20:10,936 --> 01:20:13,105
Down to the sea front?

1216
01:20:13,105 --> 01:20:16,275
If she can stay upright.

1217
01:20:20,863 --> 01:20:22,865
- Can you see her?
- No.

1218
01:20:22,865 --> 01:20:25,993
Where did she go?

1219
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:34,626
Sir.

1220
01:21:07,242 --> 01:21:10,329
So now we are all assembled.

1221
01:21:10,579 --> 01:21:13,123
What's this about Inspector?

1222
01:21:13,123 --> 01:21:15,000
Mr Poirot would like a word.

1223
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,628
But first please do sit down, all of you.

1224
01:21:17,628 --> 01:21:20,130
Please Mademoiselle Martindale.
Monsieur and Madame Bland.

1225
01:21:20,214 --> 01:21:22,257
Mademoiselle Sheila Webb.

1226
01:21:30,557 --> 01:21:33,810
I thank you all very, very much
for coming here this evening.

1227
01:21:33,810 --> 01:21:37,105
We had little choice.

1228
01:21:40,067 --> 01:21:43,820
This has been a puzzle most intriguing
which has tested Poirot,

1229
01:21:45,072 --> 01:21:47,699
but not found him wanting.

1230
01:21:47,699 --> 01:21:51,703
So first if I may let us take
a look at the facts.

1231
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:56,291
We have a telephone call made
to the Cavendish bureau requesting

1232
01:21:56,291 --> 01:21:58,210
the services of a secretary by name,

1233
01:21:58,210 --> 01:22:02,005
mademoiselle Sheila Webb, a telephone
call that nobody admits to making.

1234
01:22:03,298 --> 01:22:07,177
She arrives in a room full of clocks,
that nobody admits to owning.

1235
01:22:07,886 --> 01:22:10,681
But all of these clocks they
spell exactly the same time,

1236
01:22:10,681 --> 01:22:14,560
four thirteen, which has no significance.

1237
01:22:16,562 --> 01:22:20,482
She finds there a dead man with
an identification that is false,

1238
01:22:21,108 --> 01:22:24,987
and who is impossible to trace,
because nobody knows him.

1239
01:22:26,029 --> 01:22:29,700
I hope you will agree with me on these
facts, Mademoiselle Martindale?

1240
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:31,118
Yes.

1241
01:22:31,118 --> 01:22:33,328
Madame Bland?

1242
01:22:33,328 --> 01:22:36,915
I don't understand why myself and my
husband have been summoned here.

1243
01:22:36,915 --> 01:22:39,710
All will become clear madame.

1244
01:22:39,710 --> 01:22:43,422
Then we have the note most threatening that
was sent to mademoiselle Sheila Webb,

1245
01:22:43,463 --> 01:22:46,550
we have the second murder
that of the poor Nora Brent,

1246
01:22:46,550 --> 01:22:48,927
who was a colleague of Madamoiselle
Webb and we have

1247
01:22:48,927 --> 01:22:53,307
the identification definitive of the dead
man down to the scar behind his left ear.

1248
01:22:53,348 --> 01:22:57,686
A gentlemen who apparently was seen
in the hotel with mademoiselle Sheila Webb.

1249
01:22:57,728 --> 01:23:01,273
A man who preyed on women
who are vulnerable.

1250
01:23:01,273 --> 01:23:04,067
And then we have
complication upon complication.

1251
01:23:04,067 --> 01:23:06,361
We have evidence that is totally
circumstantial that builds

1252
01:23:06,361 --> 01:23:10,324
and builds into a wall of proof
against mademoiselle Sheila Webb.

1253
01:23:11,867 --> 01:23:15,537
But Poirot he realises that in amongst this,

1254
01:23:16,038 --> 01:23:17,831
what is the word for obscurisement?

1255
01:23:17,831 --> 01:23:21,835
This dark cloud of murder
there is one fact

1256
01:23:21,877 --> 01:23:25,881
that can be proved,
is that not so Monsieur?

1257
01:23:25,881 --> 01:23:26,924
Which is what?

1258
01:23:26,924 --> 01:23:29,718
Which is the eyewitness
Leufenant Race, who saw...

1259
01:23:29,718 --> 01:23:32,387
a woman so frightened,
so bewildered

1260
01:23:32,387 --> 01:23:36,391
that it was not possible for her
to have committed murder.

1261
01:23:37,768 --> 01:23:40,270
It was the Leftenant Race also
who led Poirot to the solution

1262
01:23:40,270 --> 01:23:42,231
when he said of the note
most threatening...

1263
01:23:42,231 --> 01:23:44,399
The only thing missing is t
hat it's not written in blood.

1264
01:23:44,399 --> 01:23:48,946
Mes amis, there are moments for
a detective when a light, it goes on.

1265
01:23:50,405 --> 01:23:53,325
Where had I heard before
that expression?

1266
01:23:53,325 --> 01:23:54,785
A cheap thriller on the stage?

1267
01:23:54,785 --> 01:23:56,912
Exactement, mon ami, exactement.

1268
01:23:56,912 --> 01:24:00,999
The word "Revenge" written
in his blood on the blotter.

1269
01:24:01,083 --> 01:24:04,837
Helas! The cheap thriller.
The plots that are complicated.

1270
01:24:04,878 --> 01:24:08,298
The usual diet of the Cavendish Bureau,
Mademoiselle Martindale

1271
01:24:08,298 --> 01:24:12,052
and it made me to think of la pauvre
mademoiselle Nora Brent,

1272
01:24:12,135 --> 01:24:15,597
a young woman who was killed because...

1273
01:24:15,597 --> 01:24:17,099
The heel of her shoe broke.

1274
01:24:17,099 --> 01:24:18,392
Oh fiddlesticks!

1275
01:24:18,392 --> 01:24:20,686
Twenty yards from her place of work.

1276
01:24:20,686 --> 01:24:24,565
Which meant that she returned early
to her desk in her lunch hour that day.

1277
01:24:24,731 --> 01:24:27,901
She knew that the telephone
it did not sound.

1278
01:24:27,901 --> 01:24:30,737
She knew that there was no telephone
call from madamoiselle Pebmarsh

1279
01:24:30,737 --> 01:24:33,574
requesting the services of the secretary
mademoiselle Sheila Webb.

1280
01:24:33,574 --> 01:24:36,243
I received the call from a Miss Pebmarsh

1281
01:24:36,243 --> 01:24:38,954
at about a quarter to two
during the lunch hour.

1282
01:24:38,954 --> 01:24:41,164
I don't see
how what she said could be true.

1283
01:24:41,164 --> 01:24:42,291
Yes, thank you madame.

1284
01:24:42,291 --> 01:24:44,918
What she said couldn't possibly be true.

1285
01:24:44,918 --> 01:24:47,880
So she had to be silenced.

1286
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:53,635
Is that not so, Mademoiselle Martindale?

1287
01:24:53,635 --> 01:24:55,012
That is ridiculous.

1288
01:24:55,012 --> 01:24:58,348
No more ridiculous than the cheap thrillers,
the plots that are complicated

1289
01:24:58,348 --> 01:25:00,434
that you had spent your life
working amongst.

1290
01:25:00,434 --> 01:25:01,852
Lunchtime girls!

1291
01:25:01,852 --> 01:25:04,062
And it was at the instigation
of Hercule Poirot

1292
01:25:04,062 --> 01:25:06,899
that Mademoiselle Sheila Webb
she made the search of the papers

1293
01:25:06,899 --> 01:25:10,569
of the estate of Garry Gregson
and she found this short story

1294
01:25:10,611 --> 01:25:12,362
that Poirot he remembered.

1295
01:25:12,362 --> 01:25:16,658
It is full of clocks,
identifications that are false.

1296
01:25:16,700 --> 01:25:20,537
There is even a build up of evidence
to frame a person who is innocent,

1297
01:25:20,787 --> 01:25:23,165
who felt so implicated in
a crime they did not commit

1298
01:25:23,165 --> 01:25:25,667
that they became
frightened and irrational

1299
01:25:25,667 --> 01:25:29,463
and therefore
more suspicious to the police.

1300
01:25:29,713 --> 01:25:31,924
It is all here Mademoiselle,

1301
01:25:31,924 --> 01:25:34,968
you could not even think
of a plot of your own devising.

1302
01:25:34,968 --> 01:25:38,180
Oh, except, pardon, the addition
you made of the clock,

1303
01:25:38,180 --> 01:25:41,767
the "Rosemary" clock that you stole from
the handbag of madamoiselle Sheila Webb

1304
01:25:41,767 --> 01:25:45,312
when she took it to the jewelers
to be repaired. Is that not so?

1305
01:25:45,312 --> 01:25:48,232
And then you frighten her
with the number 4.13

1306
01:25:48,232 --> 01:25:50,776
the time of the clocks

1307
01:25:50,776 --> 01:25:53,111
but also the room in the hotel
where mademoiselle Sheila Webb

1308
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:56,615
conducted her love affair that
was to you "oh so shameful".

1309
01:25:56,615 --> 01:25:58,575
But she is not what she seems,

1310
01:25:58,575 --> 01:26:01,995
because for mademoiselle
Sheila Webb, her love it was real.

1311
01:26:01,995 --> 01:26:04,373
Why would I want that man dead

1312
01:26:04,373 --> 01:26:07,292
in Wilbraham Orescent Monsieur,
I didn't even know him.

1313
01:26:07,292 --> 01:26:11,088
Do you know what this is Madame Bland?

1314
01:26:11,964 --> 01:26:14,174
It is the death certificate
of the first Madame Bland.

1315
01:26:14,174 --> 01:26:18,011
Not you, but a woman from Canada.

1316
01:26:18,136 --> 01:26:21,723
The woman who inherited all of the money.

1317
01:26:21,849 --> 01:26:25,769
When the inheritance came through
Joe said no-one would know,

1318
01:26:25,853 --> 01:26:28,814
they didn't know his wife was dead,
and all we had to do was...

1319
01:26:28,814 --> 01:26:32,568
- Shut up Val!
- Shut up!

1320
01:26:37,781 --> 01:26:40,826
So who is the dead man Poirot?

1321
01:26:40,826 --> 01:26:43,120
I do not know Inspector.

1322
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:45,622
But as I told to you before

1323
01:26:45,622 --> 01:26:48,917
it is not important "who he is, but who he is".

1324
01:26:48,917 --> 01:26:52,671
And Poirot suspects that he is
a friend or relative

1325
01:26:52,713 --> 01:26:55,299
of the first Madame Bland who left Canada,

1326
01:26:55,299 --> 01:26:57,217
came to this country to look her up.

1327
01:26:57,217 --> 01:27:00,095
This was a man who knew that the money
had gone to the wrong woman.

1328
01:27:00,095 --> 01:27:02,598
A man who, if murdered,
would become almost impossible

1329
01:27:02,598 --> 01:27:04,349
to trace for the police in England.

1330
01:27:04,349 --> 01:27:06,602
Madame Bland, you said
something strange to Poirot.

1331
01:27:06,602 --> 01:27:09,646
But it was natural for me to settle in Dover
because this is where my sister lives.

1332
01:27:09,646 --> 01:27:12,274
Your sister, Madame Bland...

1333
01:27:12,274 --> 01:27:16,028
Your sister who is as Canadian as you are.

1334
01:27:23,285 --> 01:27:27,331
When the letter from his wife's uncle arrived
Joe said he and Kathy could work it out.

1335
01:27:27,372 --> 01:27:30,417
He could rig the old van up
to look like the laundry.

1336
01:27:30,417 --> 01:27:33,712
Ah yes, of course the laundry van that
was seen to arrive by Madame Hemmings.

1337
01:27:33,712 --> 01:27:37,007
But it arrived on the wrong day. It arrived
on the Wednesday instead of the Tuesday.

1338
01:27:37,007 --> 01:27:40,385
Yes, you see because they wanted
to dump him at the blind woman's.

1339
01:27:40,385 --> 01:27:43,055
Find a mark on his body
and get a Merlina to verify it.

1340
01:27:43,055 --> 01:27:45,015
Who you knew from your days in the theatre?

1341
01:27:45,015 --> 01:27:47,142
Come on in. This way.

1342
01:27:47,142 --> 01:27:49,228
I hope this isn't an inconvenience?

1343
01:27:49,228 --> 01:27:52,272
Oh, not at all.

1344
01:27:55,359 --> 01:27:59,112
There look. He has a scar
behind his left ear.

1345
01:28:00,948 --> 01:28:04,117
Kathy said she knew how to make it work,
that there was a young tart

1346
01:28:04,117 --> 01:28:06,578
at the bureau who no-one would
miss, who would deserve it.

1347
01:28:06,578 --> 01:28:10,415
She said she'd set her up,
it would be all right.

1348
01:28:10,415 --> 01:28:13,210
They said there would be no reason for
the body to be at the blind woman's

1349
01:28:13,210 --> 01:28:16,129
house with Sheila Webb and it
would just confuse the police,

1350
01:28:16,129 --> 01:28:20,133
it would be confusion upon confusion,
complication upon complication.

1351
01:28:22,469 --> 01:28:26,890
Joe had worked so hard all his life for
nothing, and the money was so huge...

1352
01:28:26,932 --> 01:28:30,227
it was so huge...

1353
01:28:51,039 --> 01:28:56,545
But they made me do it, they made me put the
knife into Sheila Webb's bag, at the inquest.

1354
01:28:57,212 --> 01:28:58,547
Would you like a cup of tea?

1355
01:28:58,547 --> 01:29:01,800
They made me press Merlina to come
and lie to falsify the marriage,

1356
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:05,762
and falsely identify the body and then
when she was scared to...

1357
01:29:06,722 --> 01:29:10,350
to come to the sea front
so they could kill her...

1358
01:29:10,350 --> 01:29:13,103
it was only going to be the one death...

1359
01:29:13,103 --> 01:29:16,523
it was only going to be the one...

1360
01:29:24,781 --> 01:29:27,326
In the car!

1361
01:29:33,665 --> 01:29:36,585
Ok madame, in the back.

1362
01:29:47,679 --> 01:29:51,433
- Thank you.
- Madamoiselle.

1363
01:29:56,063 --> 01:29:58,941
Thank you Mr Poirot.

1364
01:29:58,941 --> 01:30:03,028
And if you're staying in Dover tonight I'd
very much like to stand you another pint.

1365
01:30:03,070 --> 01:30:07,157
Well that is most kind of you Inspector,
but it is tonight that I travel to London.

1366
01:30:07,908 --> 01:30:10,744
But if you should ever find yourself there,

1367
01:30:10,744 --> 01:30:14,414
if you please to look me up
I will stand for you the cocktail.

1368
01:30:14,456 --> 01:30:17,876
Right. Pleasure to know you, sir.

1369
01:30:17,876 --> 01:30:21,380
- Inspector.
- Leftenant.

1370
01:30:25,050 --> 01:30:28,804
Monsieur Colin, do I have
to tell you to go after her?

1371
01:30:31,723 --> 01:30:32,975
No.

1372
01:30:32,975 --> 01:30:36,478
Then go after her.

1373
01:31:10,137 --> 01:31:12,931
I've only known you a few days,

1374
01:31:12,931 --> 01:31:16,894
and already it's like we've fallen in love,

1375
01:31:17,394 --> 01:31:21,231
got married, had seven children, divorced,

1376
01:31:22,024 --> 01:31:25,277
met again
under peculiar circumstances,

1377
01:31:25,277 --> 01:31:29,615
married, had a few more children,
divorced...

1378
01:31:36,747 --> 01:31:40,209
She must have hated me so much.

1379
01:31:46,465 --> 01:31:49,843
Shall we start again Sheila?

1380
01:31:53,096 --> 01:31:56,850
- Yes please.
- Let's start again.

1381
