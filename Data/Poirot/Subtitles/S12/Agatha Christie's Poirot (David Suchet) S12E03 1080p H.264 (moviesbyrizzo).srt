1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:06,006
23.976

2
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:15,349
It doesn't have to be a masterpiece, Ariadne.

3
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:20,604
No, no. I'm going to take my time.
Last one looked like it'd had a stroke.

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,900
How're we doing, girls? Grand, grand!

5
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,695
Sharp now. The children are arriving!
You will stay for the party, Mrs Oliver?

6
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,405
Well, I'm not feeling too well actually -

7
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:34,159
Won't go on long. You know what children
are like. They get so giddy. That suit you?

8
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:35,202
Erm -

9
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:38,580
Excellent! First rate! They'll be thrilled
to meet you, I'm sure.

10
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:42,292
Well, must get on. Time's wing'd whatsit, eh?

11
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:47,965
- Rather a force of nature, Mrs Drake.
- Hmmm...

12
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:51,552
It is very good of you to muck in like this,
Ariadne. And your talk tomorrow -

13
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:54,721
Ah well, I've been meaning to have
a word with you about that, Judith.

14
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,640
I'm not feeling too clever.

15
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,017
I hope you've not picked up Miranda's cold.

16
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:02,646
Such a shame she couldn't come to the party.
She was so looking forward to it.

17
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:04,523
- Bless you.
- Thank you.

18
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:08,569
...which followed President Rosevelt's
speech earlier on today.

19
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,239
That is the end of the news.

20
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:19,913
- Are you sitting comfortably?
- No...

21
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,295
Good! We wouldn't want that, would we?
Not on a dark and stormy night like this one!

22
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:52,905
We shall have to keep an eye
on you, Mrs Oliver!

23
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:54,489
There'll be no apples left to bob with!

24
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:58,202
My besetting sin, I'm afraid.
I can't resist them.

25
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:02,331
All this must have set Mrs Drake
back a bob or two.

26
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:06,376
The year's on the turn, vicar.
Must we freeze yet again?

27
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,922
Alas, I'm afraid the heating at
St Wulfric's packed up ages ago.

28
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:12,549
Maybe you should try wearing an extra woolly?

29
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:13,884
It's all right for you in that cassock.

30
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:17,679
Bet you're got up like Scott of the
bloody Antarctic under that lot.

31
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,099
- Oh, bless you.
- Oh I do beg your pardon.

32
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,768
No, no, no. It's my fault.

33
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:25,604
I'm always in the way.

34
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:29,024
Mrs Reynolds. LocaI martyr.

35
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:31,777
Frances, did you ask Cook
to soak the raisins?

36
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:35,447
- Of course I did, Ma.
- Do pace yourself, darling.

37
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:39,243
Sun's well over the yard-arm, mother-mine.

38
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:42,538
Come on, Edmund. Lend a hand, for God's sake.

39
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:44,289
I'm rather absorbed as it happens.

40
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:48,085
Roderick Usher has just found
his sister bricked up.

41
00:02:48,544 --> 00:02:51,922
"We have put her living in the tomb!"
It's awfully good.

42
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:54,466
Well, I'm more concerned with
the Fall of the House of Drake,

43
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:57,886
at the moment, so stir your stumps!

44
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:02,099
Joyce Reynolds! You duffer!
What do you think you're doing?

45
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,351
- Sorry, Miss, I'm sure.
- That's alright.

46
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:05,686
Look at the poor pumpkin!

47
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:08,480
Joyce smashed the pumpkin!
Joyce smashed the pumpkin!

48
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,817
Go and boiI your head, Leopold.

49
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:15,320
Mind out Joyce!

50
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:22,160
Oh, bravo Leopold!

51
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,038
Now, who's next?
Patience, Cathie. Everyone will get a turn.

52
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,623
- Anny, come on!
- ... it'll be your turn.

53
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:31,086
Leave that, Mrs Reynolds. The party's not
over yet. You enjoy yourself.

54
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:33,338
Oh I don't mind. I like to help out.

55
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,215
All right, all right, who's next?

56
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:38,969
Mrs Drake says you're a writer.
The one who does the murder stories?

57
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:40,304
Yes.

58
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:43,348
- You must make a lot of money out of it.
- A bit.

59
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,184
That's not very polite, is it, Joyce?

60
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:48,061
And you've got a detective who's
a Finn, haven't you?

61
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:51,773
- Sven Hjerson.
- Why a Finn?

62
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,735
I've often wondered.

63
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:57,279
- I saw a murder once.
- Now don't be silly, Joyce.

64
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:59,281
- I did.
- Oh really?

65
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:02,659
Of course you didn't see a murder.
Don't say such foolish things, dear.

66
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,162
Has everyone had a go at the apples, vicar?

67
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:08,665
- Yes, all, it seems, but...
- I did see a murder! I did! I did!

68
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,418
What kind of murder, you ridiculous creature?

69
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:14,588
She's making it up. Again!

70
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,465
I'm not. I saw one.

71
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:19,301
We're going to play Snapdragon next.
It's great fun.

72
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:21,595
It wasn't really till a long
time afterwards, I mean,

73
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:24,264
that I began to realise it
was a murder I saw.

74
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,682
That's more a Christmassy thing, isn't it?

75
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,601
Well, we Drakes always play it at Hallowe'en.

76
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:30,354
Why didn't you go to the coppers then?

77
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:32,856
Because I didn't know at the time
that it was a murder.

78
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:36,318
Is that the one where you have to
pluck fruit out of a bowI or something?

79
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,028
That's right. Raisins. Soaked in liquor.

80
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:39,238
- Yes.
- Bit like Frances.

81
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:42,115
- Ha, ha.
- Then set fire to. In the dark.

82
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:46,245
Of course, now I'm older,
I know that it was a murder I saw!

83
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:50,374
Utterly potty. When was all this
supposed to have happened?

84
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,960
Years ago. I was quite young at the time.

85
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,838
- You're young now, you nit.
- Who murdered whom?

86
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:59,675
I shan't tell any of you now.
You're all so beastly.

87
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,469
Poor Miranda. She's missing a smashing party.

88
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:06,265
Oh my God! Gave me the shock of my -

89
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:10,227
Who's there? What is it? Miss Whittaker?

90
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,648
Thought I saw...

91
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:18,277
Just the wind, I expect.

92
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:25,492
A feeling of sick dread came over me as
I gazed upon that dreadfuI countenance.

93
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:29,329
At that obscene parody of a human face.

94
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:35,794
Even as I watched, his blood-shot eyeball
began to roll down the livid green skin!

95
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:39,423
"FooI!" he hissed. "Insect!...

96
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:40,632
Not enjoying it, sir?

97
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:43,260
The subject matter, Georges.
It is... distastefuI.

98
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,595
...I am eviI!

99
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:47,973
Poirot has seen much eviI in this world.
It should not be the subject of such mockery.

100
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:51,685
Oh it's just a bit of fun, sir. I love
a good blood-curdler, me.

101
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:53,812
And very appropriate for the time of year.

102
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:56,273
George, at this time of year in Belgium,

103
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:59,610
it is the custom to light the candles
in memory of the dead.

104
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:03,280
Not to tell the stories macabre.

105
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:08,702
I grieve for your carpet, Mrs Drake.
There's water everywhere.

106
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:11,496
It'll set you back quite
a bit to get it spruced up.

107
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:14,583
Oh, it's old, vicar. Not to worry.

108
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:21,632
- Now what?
- Jehovah's Witnesses?

109
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:31,225
It's Hallowe'en for young and old!

110
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:35,479
Now, who would like their fortune told?

111
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:40,651
All the bells and whistles, I see.
Woodleigh Common's very own witch.

112
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:45,197
Ma won't like this! Mrs Goodbody
was certainly not invited.

113
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:46,240
Mummy?

114
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,409
Yes, dear, very good. You should be in films.
Now come along.

115
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:53,372
We don't want any unpleasantness in front
of the children. Now come along.

116
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,041
- No, but I want to stay.
- Come along.

117
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:59,878
For the kiddies! For the kiddies!

118
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,340
Everybody ready, now! Come along!
Yes, come on. Into the parlour.

119
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,385
Come on now. Snap dragon time.

120
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:10,389
That's it. Quickly.

121
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:27,656
Take care you don't take too much, Be not
greedy in your clutch. Snip! Snap! Dragon!

122
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,912
With his blue and lapping tongue Many of
you will be stung. Snip! Snap! Dragon!

123
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:40,502
For he snaps at all that comes, Snatching
at his feast of plums. Snip! Snap! Dragon!

124
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:45,465
Shut the door!

125
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:52,097
Oh, dear, you're drenched.

126
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:54,349
What a clumsy thing you must think of me.

127
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,059
No, no, it can happen to us all.

128
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:59,188
Mustn't let the children run about
in their stockinged feet.

129
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:03,066
I'll get a brush. Mrs baker!

130
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:26,006
Snip! Snap! Dragon!

131
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,428
Very well, every one! That's your last go!

132
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:35,057
Oh, yes. Come along now, it's ten o'clock!

133
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:41,063
It's way past most of your bed-times! Time
to go home now. Come along now. Home, home.

134
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:46,652
Would you all be dears and round
up the little waifs and strays?

135
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:50,322
Some of the older ones gravitate to the
cloakrooms and what have you.

136
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:51,823
Whatever for?

137
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:53,575
What have you, I should think.

138
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:56,286
Has anyone seen my Joycie?

139
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:58,956
I'll do a head count.

140
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:11,760
- Hercule Poirot speaks.
- Oh, thank God you're in!

141
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,012
- My friend Ariadne.
- Yes. Yes, it's me.

142
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:17,140
But you are breathless. What is the matter?
Something it has upset you?

143
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,727
Upset me? Dear God.

144
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,897
I shall never be able to look
at another apple again.

145
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,929
- Glorious, isn't it?
- Oui.

146
00:09:57,556 --> 00:09:58,724
The leaves are like gold.

147
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:02,936
No, no. I meant the mucky old window
and the dusty seats!

148
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:06,732
The pervasive odour of Capstan Navy Cut
and schooI-boys' socks.

149
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:10,527
I see you have been out of England
some little time, Monsieur.

150
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:14,448
Fresh off the boat. From Athens. Superb.

151
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:17,701
But I do miss the old country.

152
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:20,871
- Heading far?
- Woodleigh Common.

153
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:24,583
Me too! How very nice. I live there,
as a matter of fact.

154
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:25,459
- Indeed?
- Mm.

155
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,127
For how long, may I ask?

156
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:31,465
About three years. Came to do
a garden. Never left.

157
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:35,052
That's what I do. Gardens. Creation thereof.

158
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:38,096
A very beautifuI part of the world.

159
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:41,350
- MichaeI Garfield.
- Hercule Poirot.

160
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:45,437
- Well, there's a turn up!
- Oui.

161
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:49,316
- Good to know you, monsieur.
- Je vous emprie.

162
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:52,319
- On pleasure bent, I trust?
- Indeed, no.

163
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:55,322
- No?
- Non.

164
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,159
Regardez.

165
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,626
Good God. Poor kid.

166
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:12,172
Oui d'accord. The murder of a child it
is a crime so terrible, n'est pas?

167
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,261
Have they got anyone for it?

168
00:11:17,553 --> 00:11:19,972
Non. And this little girI Joyce,
she was known to you?

169
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:23,976
No, no, I couldn't claim to know her but

170
00:11:24,977 --> 00:11:27,396
seen her around the place I expect.

171
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:31,191
So you'll be coming round to give
everyone the third degree then?

172
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:34,319
Perhaps.

173
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:37,030
In the mean time, I wonder,
some advice, s'iI vous plait?

174
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,323
Yes. Fire away.

175
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:41,702
If I were to seek out the locaI,
how do you call it?

176
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:45,747
The chitter-chatter, oui, the locaI gossip.
To whom should I go?

177
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,960
Monsieur?

178
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:53,964
Tell me. Do you believe in witches?

179
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,481
My God, as it is melancholy.

180
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:12,691
What?

181
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:15,485
I mean, clearing up after a party
is always a bit of a chore

182
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:18,906
but when one's had a murder it
feels so very parochiaI.

183
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:22,326
- Stop trying to be clever.
- I don't have to try, Edmund.

184
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:23,619
Stop it, both of you!

185
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:25,204
- Sorry, Mummy.
- Sorry, Mummy...

186
00:12:25,204 --> 00:12:27,998
It's bad enough that this terrible
thing happened in our house

187
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:32,002
without you two snapping at one another
like a couple of terriers.

188
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:38,175
You know who the police will be
straight onto, of course.

189
00:12:38,175 --> 00:12:40,594
What the hell do you mean?

190
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:44,056
Well, they hauled you in when that grubby
little crook got himself killed.

191
00:12:44,056 --> 00:12:48,060
And they couldn't find anything to pin
on me then either, could they, Edmund?

192
00:12:58,028 --> 00:12:59,738
What are you doing, mummy?

193
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:03,033
Oh just old clutter.

194
00:13:03,242 --> 00:13:06,578
Lots of things I should have
got rid of long ago.

195
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:11,542
I'd rather you stayed in, Miranda.
You're still off-colour, and besides -

196
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:12,918
I know what you're going to say.

197
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:17,631
There really is a maniac on the loose.
Will you stay indoors? For me?

198
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:24,346
Of course I will. I have to telephone
Cathie, though -

199
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,359
- Mademoiselle?
- Who are you?

200
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:40,529
- Hercule Poirot.
- Oh hello.

201
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:43,115
- Yes. Ariadne said you were coming.
- Madame...

202
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:45,409
I'm sorry it's under such dreadfuI
circumstances.

203
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:48,412
Yes, indeed. But it is most kind
of you to accommodate me.

204
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:52,291
Oh, it's a pleasure. Where are
my manners? Come in, please!

205
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,502
Merci.

206
00:13:56,712 --> 00:13:58,797
Are you the detective man?

207
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:02,634
Ah oui. Hercule Poirot.

208
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:06,513
He is the greatest detective in the world.

209
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:10,350
- And how do you call yourself?
- I'm Miranda.

210
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,643
Mademoiselle Miranda.

211
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:14,730
You'll be wanting to see Ariadne, I expect.

212
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,732
I'm afraid she's in bed, poor thing.

213
00:14:16,732 --> 00:14:19,109
Indeed?

214
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:34,958
You'll stay then? Get to the bottom
of this ghastly thing?

215
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,711
Oui Madame.

216
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:42,591
"I saw a murder once".
That is what the girI said?

217
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:46,637
Lots of people were talking but we all
heard her quite distinctly, didn't we?

218
00:14:46,637 --> 00:14:48,388
There was a generaI pooh-poohing.

219
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,474
Did you believe her?

220
00:14:50,474 --> 00:14:54,186
Of course not. She was
showing off, I'm afraid.

221
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:58,649
It's a rather tiresome age.
It seems unkind to say it -

222
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,901
Non, non, non, Madame.

223
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:04,863
In a case of murder it is not unkind
to say what the victim was like.

224
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:08,534
Indeed it is most necessary.

225
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:11,703
And this girI, she gave no details? No names?

226
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:16,208
No. She got a bit upset because
people were laughing at her.

227
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:18,752
Did she say when this murder it occurred?

228
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:23,799
Years ago, she said. But she said it in
a rather would-be grown up sort of way.

229
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:26,635
She had not told the police?

230
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:31,431
No. She said, "I didn't know at
the time that it was a murder".

231
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:35,978
That is the remark most interesting.

232
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:42,901
How is it that you come to know
Madame Oliver?

233
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:45,571
I went on a Hellenic cruise this year.

234
00:15:45,571 --> 00:15:49,324
I managed to prevent Ariadne from
falling into the harbour!

235
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:53,078
We became fast friends after that.

236
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:55,539
And you have lived here a long
time in Woodleigh Common?

237
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:57,416
Oh yes. Years.

238
00:15:57,416 --> 00:16:00,127
And Monsieur Butler?

239
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:04,590
I'm afraid it's rather a sad story.
Max was a pilot.

240
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,675
He had an accident.

241
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:11,263
It happened before Miranda was born
so he never saw his little girI.

242
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:14,600
Ah. Je suis desole, Madame.

243
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:18,604
But he would have been
of her most proud, I am sure.

244
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:21,356
What now, Monsieur?

245
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:25,194
Now it is time for Poirot to make
a visit to the police.

246
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:28,405
It's a horrible business.

247
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:32,409
The death of a child is always
a bit of a wrench. But this...

248
00:16:32,576 --> 00:16:36,538
He was probably peeping through the French
windows. That lock's very unsound.

249
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:39,708
He saw there was a kiddies' party going on,

250
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:42,669
lured the girI to the library
and then killed her.

251
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:43,795
He?

252
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:47,966
Some lunatic. They let all sorts of
people roam the streets these days.

253
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:52,054
And you have interviewed
all those who were present

254
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:54,515
at the Hallowe'en party and
established their whereabouts?

255
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:57,100
Of course.

256
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:58,977
With what result?

257
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:02,356
No-one seems to remember when
they last saw Joyce Reynolds.

258
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:05,400
The murder almost certainly took place
during the game of Snapdragon -

259
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,569
all the lights in the parlour were off.

260
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:09,821
If anyone came or went, no-one
saw who they were.

261
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:12,407
And what about what was
said by the little girI?

262
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:14,868
That she witnessed once a murder?

263
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:18,830
Utter rot. You know what kids are like.
Always exaggerating.

264
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:21,708
They'd tell you black was white at that age.

265
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,669
Why? You reckon there's something in it?

266
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:27,923
I do not know. A young girI boasts
to have seen a murder

267
00:17:27,965 --> 00:17:30,342
and some hours later, that girI she is dead.

268
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:34,388
It could be cause and effect but if so,
somebody lost no time.

269
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:41,436
There have been murders
not solved in this area?

270
00:17:41,645 --> 00:17:45,065
Look, I don't mean to be rude, sir.
I mean, I've heard of you, of course.

271
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:49,319
Who hasn't? But we have very modern
methods of policing nowadays.

272
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:54,324
I know you're very hot on your theorising.
Your psychologicaI whatnots.

273
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:57,703
But I think this is better
left to us, don't you?

274
00:17:57,703 --> 00:18:00,747
To the professionals.

275
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:05,878
- We'll get there, don't you worry.
- Of that I have no doubt.

276
00:18:08,172 --> 00:18:10,966
What are you going to do now, then?

277
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:14,887
With your permission, I will visit
the scene of the crime.

278
00:18:16,388 --> 00:18:18,807
Good day to you, Inspector.

279
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:40,495
This is Mrs Drake's famous garden.

280
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:43,707
But it is exquisite.

281
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:48,378
I'll have to tell Mrs Drake Ariadne
can't give her W.I. talk this afternoon.

282
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,380
Though under the circumstances...

283
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,757
Ah oui. Vraiment. Oui.

284
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:55,928
She's assumed command magnificently.
She's rather good at that.

285
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:12,277
Madame, s'iI vous plait? Merci.

286
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:23,121
- All right?
- Oui, merci. C'est formidable!

287
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:26,416
And yet people very rarely visit here.

288
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,168
And why is that?

289
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:31,922
- Monsieur!
- Ah! Monsieur Garfield.

290
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:34,842
Mrs Butler.

291
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:37,553
So, what do you make of my little kingdom?

292
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:42,724
Ah! So this was the garden that you came here
to execute? C'est vraiment superb.

293
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:47,855
Of course, officially I finished it ages ago.
But beauty always draws me back.

294
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:52,526
I'm a bit like that dauber they used
to drag out of art galleries

295
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:55,946
because he'd still be re-touching his
paintings years after they'd been sold!

296
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:58,407
"Another five minutes,
and it'll be a masterpiece!"

297
00:19:58,407 --> 00:20:01,451
We really shouldn't keep Mrs Drake waiting.

298
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:05,372
- Non. Monsieur.
- Monsieur.

299
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:14,047
My poor Joyce. It's God's will, I suppose.
He moves in mysterious ways.

300
00:20:15,883 --> 00:20:21,555
They say He gathers those close to him
who he cannot bear to be parted from.

301
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:27,060
Now all I've got is my Leopold. Thank you.

302
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:33,984
Mrs Butler. And this must be -

303
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:37,738
Hercule Poirot. Enchante Madame.

304
00:20:37,738 --> 00:20:41,617
This is Mrs Reynolds - and Leopold.

305
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:44,745
Master Leopold.

306
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,164
I am so very sorry for your loss.

307
00:20:47,164 --> 00:20:51,126
- Thank you. You're the detective, are you?
- Oui, Madame.

308
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:55,756
It's very good of you, I'm sure,
to come down here and help us.

309
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:59,510
De rien. I do not wish to distress you.

310
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:04,473
I only wish to ask of you
a few questions perhaps?

311
00:21:04,515 --> 00:21:08,685
- Oh, of course. Please, do sit down.
- Merci, Madame.

312
00:21:11,772 --> 00:21:13,440
No Mrs Oliver?

313
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,943
I'm afraid she's come down
with Miranda's cold.

314
00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:18,820
Oh!

315
00:21:19,655 --> 00:21:23,242
Madame, you saw no-one leave the room
during the game of the Snapdragon?

316
00:21:23,242 --> 00:21:26,912
No, no, no. It was pitch black, you see.

317
00:21:26,954 --> 00:21:30,082
And there was an awfuI lot
of to-ing and fro-ing.

318
00:21:30,082 --> 00:21:32,084
Yes. No wonder nobody noticed him.

319
00:21:32,084 --> 00:21:33,877
Noticed who, Madame?

320
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:39,424
The killer. The police think it was a tramp
or something, don't they?

321
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:43,303
Oui but... You know this remark that
was made by your daughter?

322
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:47,182
That she once witnessed a murder?

323
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:52,813
God forgive me for saying this, but we
all know what my Joycey was like.

324
00:21:52,855 --> 00:21:54,064
She loved to tell a tall tale.

325
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:59,820
She'd have been showing off to try
and impress that London person.

326
00:21:59,862 --> 00:22:03,490
Perhaps. But if she did witnessed
such a thing then...

327
00:22:03,532 --> 00:22:07,202
Are you sure you're going about
this the right way, Monsieur?

328
00:22:07,411 --> 00:22:10,038
Shouldn't you be looking for Joyce's
killer in the here and now?

329
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:13,917
"Old sins cast long shadows", Madame.

330
00:23:21,777 --> 00:23:26,114
Madame Goodbody... I am told that you have
the knowledge unrivalled in this village.

331
00:23:26,156 --> 00:23:29,868
- Nosy in other words!
- No, no, not at all -

332
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:33,622
I don't mind what people think.

333
00:23:33,747 --> 00:23:36,834
You'll always get the truth out
of Mother Goodbody, mister.

334
00:23:36,834 --> 00:23:39,920
More than from most others round here.

335
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,757
I's always been on the outside me,
looking in.

336
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:47,553
That ways, you get to see things different.

337
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:51,306
I sees things all the time.

338
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:54,726
Sometimes with me eyes,
sometimes in the leaves.

339
00:23:54,726 --> 00:23:58,730
- Comment? The leaves?
- Tea leaves, my duck.

340
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:04,945
You can see a lot in 'em. Past, future.
Sometimes just tea.

341
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:10,659
Mebbes our little Joyce might
have seen things too.

342
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:14,246
Quite so.

343
00:24:15,664 --> 00:24:19,418
- Let me see. Deaths in the village.
- Oui.

344
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:20,419
How far back?

345
00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:24,214
Well, Madamoiselle Joyce said
the murder took place

346
00:24:24,256 --> 00:24:29,178
when she was quite young so, perhaps,
in the last five years or so?

347
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:33,849
Well of course, there's plenty has had their
three score and ten and died naturaI.

348
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,935
But as far as I can see there's
only three possibles

349
00:24:36,935 --> 00:24:39,980
for this "murder" what Joyce said she saw.

350
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,816
And they are?

351
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:48,322
- Beatrice White.
- The madamoiselle?

352
00:24:50,032 --> 00:24:53,827
Monsieur Lesley Ferrier.

353
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:56,496
Monsieur Lesley...

354
00:24:56,997 --> 00:24:58,874
Ferrier. So.

355
00:24:58,874 --> 00:25:01,835
And Mrs Llewellyn-Smythe.

356
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,345
Alors. Let us take them then in
the order of their deaths.

357
00:25:11,345 --> 00:25:16,391
Mrs Llewellyn-Smythe went first.
Two and half years back.

358
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:20,437
She was Mrs Drake's old aunt.

359
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:27,611
I used to char for her. Then she got rid
of me and got herself a whatsit.

360
00:25:29,446 --> 00:25:31,281
An opera girI.

361
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:35,661
An opera girI? Ah! An au-pair girI.

362
00:25:35,702 --> 00:25:40,082
That's what I said. Olga Seminoff.

363
00:25:43,001 --> 00:25:46,797
Foreign, she was. The vicar arranged it.

364
00:25:48,048 --> 00:25:52,719
I always thought that Olga was
a right little gold-digger.

365
00:25:53,303 --> 00:25:56,932
Mrs Llewellyn-Smythe was rich, you see.

366
00:25:57,224 --> 00:25:58,934
Rich as Croesus.

367
00:25:58,934 --> 00:26:02,145
So there was some suspicion
surrounding her death?

368
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:05,774
Well, she had a bad heart.

369
00:26:05,774 --> 00:26:09,528
Nobody said there were anything
unny about her going like that.

370
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:12,155
But it was sudden.

371
00:26:12,155 --> 00:26:15,868
So therefore it is possible that
she was poisoned by this Olga?

372
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:19,413
But then how would little Joyce know
of a thing like this?

373
00:26:19,413 --> 00:26:22,833
Oh, it's possible, in't it?

374
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:27,671
Oui. And the next name? Lesley Ferrier?

375
00:26:29,173 --> 00:26:32,467
Solicitor's clerk here in the village.

376
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:38,891
They never got who did it. But the point is,

377
00:26:38,891 --> 00:26:44,980
he and Joyce were under the same roof!
He was Mrs Reynolds' lodger!

378
00:26:45,063 --> 00:26:48,984
Ah! So there is certainly
the connection there.

379
00:26:50,152 --> 00:26:53,989
And this Lesley Ferrier did he have
any other associates?

380
00:26:54,781 --> 00:27:01,455
He was courting a girI in the village.
That tarty piece. Rowena Drake's daughter.

381
00:27:03,624 --> 00:27:07,377
And yet the little Joyce said that...

382
00:27:07,377 --> 00:27:11,048
"I did not know at that time
it was a murder".

383
00:27:11,882 --> 00:27:16,053
So this does not fit in with
a crime of such violence.

384
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:22,142
Alors, the last name,
this Madamoiselle Beatrice White?

385
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,523
She was Joyce's schooI teacher! Drowned.

386
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:32,486
Accident they reckoned. Apparently,
she had been drinking.

387
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:43,080
Ah. This Poirot likes better.
It is much more likely.

388
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,750
The thing is you see there'd been
mutterings about her.

389
00:27:47,042 --> 00:27:50,671
From the parents. About her suitability.

390
00:27:50,671 --> 00:27:54,466
She was very thick with the church
organist, Elizabeth Whittaker.

391
00:27:56,385 --> 00:27:59,263
Very thick.

392
00:28:00,681 --> 00:28:07,855
I see. Alors, you have been of the greatest
assistance, Madame. Merci beaucoup.

393
00:28:23,704 --> 00:28:24,913
'Evening, vicar.

394
00:28:24,913 --> 00:28:27,374
Oh, Miss Whittaker.
I was just shutting up shop.

395
00:28:27,374 --> 00:28:31,336
Mrs Reynolds is thinking of
"Before Jehovah's AwefuI Throne"

396
00:28:31,378 --> 00:28:35,549
for the funeraI and I'm a bit rusty.
Thought I might do some practice?

397
00:28:35,591 --> 00:28:37,968
Be my guest.

398
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,554
You've had another one, then?

399
00:28:40,554 --> 00:28:44,391
- Yes. Good evening.
- Good evening.

400
00:28:52,065 --> 00:28:54,318
Tell to me if you please Ms Fullerton...

401
00:28:54,318 --> 00:28:58,238
Were you satisfied with Ms Lesley
Ferrier as an employee?

402
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,825
He had his points.
Handled clients well. But...

403
00:29:01,825 --> 00:29:03,577
But?

404
00:29:03,577 --> 00:29:07,497
He'd been in bother with the
police when he was younger.

405
00:29:07,497 --> 00:29:11,376
I gave him the benefit of the doubt.
Took him on here.

406
00:29:12,044 --> 00:29:14,129
It didn't really work out, though, alas.

407
00:29:14,129 --> 00:29:15,255
Non?

408
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:19,343
I rather suspected he was
snooping into private documents.

409
00:29:19,343 --> 00:29:23,388
I was on the point of giving him
a formaI warning when...

410
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:27,059
- He was stabbed to death.
- I'm afraid so.

411
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,769
Vraiment.

412
00:29:28,769 --> 00:29:31,104
Now I am given to understand
that Ms Lesley Ferrier

413
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:35,484
was close to Mdms Frances,
the daughter of Madame Drake?

414
00:29:36,068 --> 00:29:38,195
I believe they were
stepping out together, yes.

415
00:29:38,195 --> 00:29:40,113
And I wonder, Monsieur Fullerton,

416
00:29:40,113 --> 00:29:43,825
did you ever act on behalf of
the late Mdm Llewellyn- Smythe?

417
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:48,038
I did indeed. Nothing fishy
about her passing, I'd say.

418
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:54,294
She was a good age. No, the queer
business was what happened afterwards.

419
00:29:54,878 --> 00:29:57,464
- With the will.
- The will?

420
00:29:57,464 --> 00:30:02,427
As you are aware, Louise Llewellyn-Smythe's
last will and testament

421
00:30:02,469 --> 00:30:06,390
has remained unaltered for severaI years now.

422
00:30:06,723 --> 00:30:11,353
Legacies for Frances and Edmund
then the bulk of the estate

423
00:30:11,395 --> 00:30:15,983
passed on to yourself, Mrs Drake,
and to your late husband.

424
00:30:16,024 --> 00:30:18,402
Come on, Fullerton. Don't drag it out.

425
00:30:18,402 --> 00:30:22,531
A few weeks ago, however,
I received the following letter

426
00:30:22,573 --> 00:30:27,494
from Mrs Llewellyn-Smythe which
contained the following document.

427
00:30:27,536 --> 00:30:32,875
It is a codiciI to the originaI will,
drawn up in her own hand.

428
00:30:32,916 --> 00:30:38,213
Your aunt states clearly her desire
to leave her entire estate

429
00:30:38,297 --> 00:30:43,135
and fortune to Miss Olga Seminoff.

430
00:30:46,054 --> 00:30:49,099
- What!
- There must be some mistake.

431
00:30:49,099 --> 00:30:51,393
Olga?

432
00:30:51,393 --> 00:30:55,147
The notion that she would disinherit
her own flesh and blood

433
00:30:55,189 --> 00:30:58,692
and leave everything to
a virtuaI stranger, well...

434
00:30:58,734 --> 00:31:02,196
And the family Drake they
contested the codiciI?

435
00:31:02,196 --> 00:31:06,033
No need in the end. A forgery.

436
00:31:07,075 --> 00:31:11,914
A forgery. D'accord. And what
became of Olga Seminoff?

437
00:31:11,955 --> 00:31:14,917
Upped and left soon after.

438
00:31:14,917 --> 00:31:17,669
Just so.

439
00:31:24,051 --> 00:31:27,888
Well, if that's all...

440
00:31:28,263 --> 00:31:32,518
Yes, of course. Merci beaucoup,
monsieur Fullerton.

441
00:31:46,281 --> 00:31:50,202
Chere Madame, you should not work,
you should rest.

442
00:31:50,244 --> 00:31:54,122
I have deadlines, Poirot.
In sickness and in health.

443
00:31:55,457 --> 00:31:59,878
And my child of an editor is pressing me for
another draft of 'I'II Huff and I'II Puff'.

444
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,838
Comment?

445
00:32:00,838 --> 00:32:04,883
Sven Hjerson solves a murder
in a hot air balloon over Abyssinia.

446
00:32:06,677 --> 00:32:11,014
Anyway, how are you getting on?
With the reaI murder?

447
00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:16,270
Eh bien, I have verified what was
told to me by Mdm Goodbody.

448
00:32:17,187 --> 00:32:20,691
And there appear to be three deaths
which might possibly be

449
00:32:20,732 --> 00:32:24,236
the "murder" which was referred
to by Joyce Reynolds.

450
00:32:24,236 --> 00:32:26,280
I've been thinking about that.

451
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:29,867
It seems to me Joyce wouldn't
have said what she did,

452
00:32:29,867 --> 00:32:32,578
had she known who had actually
committed this murder she saw.

453
00:32:32,578 --> 00:32:34,204
Poirot has considered this also.

454
00:32:34,204 --> 00:32:40,419
Either that or she did not recognise that the
murderer was present at the Hallowe'en party.

455
00:32:42,045 --> 00:32:43,839
It is most intriguing, non?

456
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:45,549
Ready when you are, monsieur!

457
00:32:45,549 --> 00:32:47,092
Madame, I must now take my leave.

458
00:32:47,092 --> 00:32:50,888
I attend the morning service here
in the church in the village.

459
00:32:53,932 --> 00:32:56,226
What's the matter?

460
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:00,522
It is my feet. They cause me the pain.

461
00:33:00,522 --> 00:33:05,110
It's those silly patent leather shoes
of yours. Ludicrous for the country.

462
00:33:05,152 --> 00:33:10,157
Now why don't you get yourself a nice pair of
those buckskin ones? With the rubber soles?

463
00:33:10,199 --> 00:33:14,745
Madame. Chere Madame, I do not know
that I agree with you.

464
00:33:21,835 --> 00:33:25,714
"And they brought unto him also
infants, that he would touch them.

465
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:30,594
But when his disciples saw it,
they rebuked them.

466
00:33:31,094 --> 00:33:35,974
But Jesus called them unto him, and said,
Suffer little children to come unto me,

467
00:33:36,016 --> 00:33:41,188
and forbid them not: for of such
is the kingdom of God...

468
00:33:42,523 --> 00:33:45,317
verily I say unto you, whosoever shall not...

469
00:33:45,317 --> 00:33:49,154
You must come to luncheon today, monsieur.

470
00:33:49,947 --> 00:33:52,741
I should be delighted, Madame,
but alas, I have...

471
00:33:52,741 --> 00:33:55,911
Excellent. Shall we say one o'clock?

472
00:33:56,453 --> 00:33:58,914
Merci.

473
00:33:59,122 --> 00:34:01,458
Don't worry, M. Poirot. We can spare you.

474
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:03,043
Oh!

475
00:34:03,043 --> 00:34:06,672
But Jesus said: unless you converted
and become like children,

476
00:34:06,672 --> 00:34:11,260
you shall not enter the kingdom of heaven.

477
00:34:17,724 --> 00:34:21,979
You must wrap up, Miranda. It's nippy
out there. It's nippy in here.

478
00:34:23,355 --> 00:34:27,025
"Only sleeping". Do you think
that's true, Mummy?

479
00:34:27,067 --> 00:34:32,239
Well, as a gardener, I'd have to say no.
I favour turning into compost.

480
00:34:32,281 --> 00:34:37,411
We're not used to seeing you here,
Mr Garfield. Have you seen the light?

481
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:40,247
Compost?

482
00:34:40,247 --> 00:34:44,168
Well, it's not a bad idea, is it?
To return to nature.

483
00:34:45,043 --> 00:34:50,090
I was wondering if we could go and take
tea sometime soon? The three of us?

484
00:34:50,132 --> 00:34:52,759
- Oh yes!
- No. I'm afraid not.

485
00:34:52,759 --> 00:34:53,802
Why not?

486
00:34:53,802 --> 00:34:55,512
You've been poorly, my darling. That's why.

487
00:34:55,512 --> 00:34:58,557
She's not made of glass, you know.

488
00:35:05,314 --> 00:35:08,442
- M'sieur.
- Lovely morning!

489
00:35:08,442 --> 00:35:10,861
Cheerio Mr Fullerton.

490
00:35:12,154 --> 00:35:15,157
Inspector, you progress
in the hunt for the lunatic?

491
00:35:15,157 --> 00:35:17,826
Yup.

492
00:35:21,788 --> 00:35:24,791
Master Leopold is it not?

493
00:35:25,209 --> 00:35:29,171
Ah, c'est tres jolie.
It is a present, perhaps?

494
00:35:29,213 --> 00:35:33,133
- Pocket money. I saved up.
- Most perspicacious.

495
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:40,724
I wouldn't pay much attention to
what Joyce said if I were you.

496
00:35:40,724 --> 00:35:41,975
Indeed?

497
00:35:41,975 --> 00:35:45,771
It was all a lot of hooey. Who on earth
would she see murdered?

498
00:35:47,481 --> 00:35:51,485
I suppose you expect me to be all sad and
boo-hooing about the place but I'm not.

499
00:35:53,195 --> 00:35:56,865
I know she was my sister and
all that but I didn't really like her.

500
00:36:11,338 --> 00:36:15,300
An extraordinary woman, Mrs Reynolds.
Quite extraordinary.

501
00:36:15,634 --> 00:36:19,721
Not the girI's flesh and blood,
of course but still so very stoic.

502
00:36:20,764 --> 00:36:23,725
It's Monsieur Poirot, isn't it?

503
00:36:23,725 --> 00:36:26,645
Yes, indeed, Reverend Cottrell.

504
00:36:26,645 --> 00:36:30,315
- Pardon, but not the girI's flesh and blood?
- Step-mother.

505
00:36:30,774 --> 00:36:34,653
Tell to me if you please, about the child
Joyce Reynolds, what was she like?

506
00:36:36,738 --> 00:36:39,783
Well, one hates to speak ill of the dead but

507
00:36:39,783 --> 00:36:44,204
she was rather given to embroidering
things, I'm afraid.

508
00:36:44,246 --> 00:36:46,164
Always telling tall stories.

509
00:36:46,164 --> 00:36:49,293
I remember her uncle had
been to India on holiday

510
00:36:49,293 --> 00:36:51,587
and she had us all believing
that she'd been there.

511
00:36:51,587 --> 00:36:56,925
Went on about a Maharajah and shooting
at tigers and elephants and so on.

512
00:36:57,009 --> 00:37:00,137
And the stories got added to every time.
There were more tigers.

513
00:37:00,137 --> 00:37:05,267
Far more tigers than were remotely possible.
And she hadn't even been there!

514
00:37:05,309 --> 00:37:09,104
But this does not mean that
every story she told was a lie.

515
00:37:09,897 --> 00:37:11,607
Excuse me, if you please.

516
00:37:11,607 --> 00:37:14,067
Mademoiselle Whittaker?

517
00:37:14,067 --> 00:37:17,613
Oh, you must be Monsieur Poirot.
I heard you were here.

518
00:37:17,613 --> 00:37:23,702
Madamoiselle. If you please tell me
about your poor friend Mms Beatrice White.

519
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:27,915
What do you mean? Beatrice? What for?

520
00:37:27,915 --> 00:37:31,460
Well, it might be relevant to the
death of the child Joyce Reynolds.

521
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:35,839
But how could it? There was nothing
suspicious about Beatrice's death.

522
00:37:35,881 --> 00:37:38,884
It was an accident. The inquest
said it was an accident.

523
00:37:38,884 --> 00:37:42,804
But at this present time
no-one is suggesting otherwise.

524
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,640
She meant to you a great deaI.

525
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,101
Beatrice was the finest person I've ever met.

526
00:37:48,101 --> 00:37:51,188
I cared for her very deeply, monsieur.

527
00:37:51,188 --> 00:37:56,610
And I only discovered how much she cared
when it was too late. Good day monsieur.

528
00:38:14,586 --> 00:38:18,549
Miss Whittaker! Are you all right?

529
00:38:19,049 --> 00:38:22,135
Yes. Quite all right, thank you.

530
00:38:27,516 --> 00:38:31,645
This is where it happened, isn't it?
Your poor friend.

531
00:38:34,857 --> 00:38:38,735
I know what it's like. To lose someone.

532
00:38:39,069 --> 00:38:42,072
But the pain does pass in time. Believe me.

533
00:38:42,072 --> 00:38:46,285
I... I just can't help thinking of what
might have been.

534
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:51,415
- Do you understand?
- Of course.

535
00:38:52,457 --> 00:38:56,670
So many of us have lost loved ones,
haven't we? Poor Mrs Reynolds now.

536
00:38:56,712 --> 00:39:01,216
Oh, that woman. She rather
gives me the horrors.

537
00:39:01,258 --> 00:39:05,345
Putting it all down to the Almighty
and his impenetrable plans.

538
00:39:06,138 --> 00:39:09,224
Well, I suppose we all cope in our own way.

539
00:39:09,224 --> 00:39:12,895
Wants us all to think
she's the modeI Christian.

540
00:39:12,895 --> 00:39:16,857
But there's not a lot of charity
in that heart, I can tell you.

541
00:39:17,107 --> 00:39:23,155
Reynolds wanted Beatrice out
of the schooI. Well, she got her way.

542
00:39:39,796 --> 00:39:42,090
Mm. You can't keep away!

543
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:46,887
Monsieur. Madame Butler she has told to me
that this garden, it is open to the public.

544
00:39:46,929 --> 00:39:50,265
And yet, this, this place
of beauty it is deserted.

545
00:39:50,265 --> 00:39:55,771
Oh yes, it's supposed to be unlucky. It's old
superstitions left over from the CiviI War.

546
00:39:55,812 --> 00:39:57,064
Indeed?

547
00:39:57,064 --> 00:40:00,776
Oh yes. The Witchfinder GeneraI.
Very active round these parts, he was.

548
00:40:00,817 --> 00:40:04,154
Lot of poor old hags were dunked to death.

549
00:40:04,154 --> 00:40:06,073
Comment? Dunked?

550
00:40:06,073 --> 00:40:09,952
- Dunked, yes. Drowned.
- Oh!

551
00:40:10,035 --> 00:40:14,623
There was a pond somewhere over there
and they used to put the accused 'witch'

552
00:40:14,706 --> 00:40:17,376
on a ducking stooI and plunge
her into the water

553
00:40:17,376 --> 00:40:21,421
and if she floated she was guilty,
and if she sank she was innocent.

554
00:40:22,631 --> 00:40:26,426
- So a bit of a no-win situation, frankly.
- Oui.

555
00:40:30,347 --> 00:40:35,269
It is curious to consider, is it not,
that this garden so beautifuI

556
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:39,231
of Mdm Llewellyn-Smythe was nearly
inherited by someone else.

557
00:40:39,273 --> 00:40:40,232
What do you mean?

558
00:40:40,232 --> 00:40:42,651
The claim of the au pair? Olga Seminoff?

559
00:40:42,651 --> 00:40:47,197
Oh that! Yes, yes, that was
funny. Very like her to aim high.

560
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:50,200
- So you knew her?
- Oh yes.

561
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,870
Ever so popular with the
young men of Woodleigh Common.

562
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:56,081
You are suggesting she was
possessed of the loose morals?

563
00:40:56,081 --> 00:41:01,378
Well, that is one way of putting it.
Young Olga was a raven-haired beauty.

564
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:03,380
You were an admirer of hers, Monsieur?

565
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:07,050
- No, no, no, no, not my type at all.
- Oh!

566
00:41:10,304 --> 00:41:11,263
You off to the house?

567
00:41:11,263 --> 00:41:15,434
Oui. I have a luncheon appointment
with Madame Drake.

568
00:41:16,059 --> 00:41:19,855
You will only survive if you look at her
reflection in a polished shield!

569
00:41:24,026 --> 00:41:26,695
Monsieur.

570
00:41:33,035 --> 00:41:36,914
"Sven Hjerson narrowed his eyes
and surveyed the room.

571
00:41:38,207 --> 00:41:43,295
'You do realise, of course, that the killer
was in the balloon the whole time?'

572
00:41:45,297 --> 00:41:47,633
No, no, no, that doesn't work, does it?

573
00:41:47,633 --> 00:41:51,303
He couldn't have been there if he
had to sign the poison register -

574
00:41:55,015 --> 00:41:57,768
Miranda, dear, are you listening?

575
00:41:58,185 --> 00:42:02,523
Oh, yes. Sorry. Sorry, Mrs Oliver.
Where were we?

576
00:42:02,564 --> 00:42:06,443
I've just realised I've got to cut
one of my favourite ideas.

577
00:42:07,653 --> 00:42:09,780
Shame.

578
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,114
Does that happen a lot?

579
00:42:11,114 --> 00:42:16,745
More than you'd think! But hey ho.
One often has to sacrifice one's babies.

580
00:42:17,996 --> 00:42:19,039
Sacrifice?

581
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:24,336
Sorry. Sorry, I didn't mean that to sound, oh
dear, here's me going on about my silly book.

582
00:42:24,378 --> 00:42:27,965
I'm perfectly alright. Honestly.

583
00:42:27,965 --> 00:42:29,967
It is awfully nice having
you here, you know.

584
00:42:29,967 --> 00:42:34,680
Really? I can't say I've been
exactly effervescent company!

585
00:42:35,264 --> 00:42:37,724
Even so.

586
00:42:37,724 --> 00:42:42,437
It's always just been the two of us.
I think Mummy must get awfully lonely.

587
00:42:51,905 --> 00:42:53,782
Please put that book away, Edmund.

588
00:42:53,782 --> 00:42:56,994
But... yes, mummy. Sorry.

589
00:43:02,082 --> 00:43:06,086
How are you finding us here in
Woodleigh Common, Mr Poirot? Common?

590
00:43:08,422 --> 00:43:11,592
Indeed most uncommon, mademoiselle Frances.

591
00:43:11,592 --> 00:43:16,513
Frankie, please. I mean, fancy saddling your
daughter with a name like Frances Drake.

592
00:43:16,555 --> 00:43:21,435
I've told you a thousand times, it's only
ignorant people who make a joke out of -

593
00:43:21,476 --> 00:43:24,438
Yes, but it's me who has to live with it.

594
00:43:24,438 --> 00:43:28,275
I've heard them all. Armada this,
game of bowls that.

595
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,278
I've even been begged to throw down
my raincoat over a puddle

596
00:43:31,278 --> 00:43:34,198
for some queen or other. I forget his name.

597
00:43:34,198 --> 00:43:36,116
That was Raleigh, not Drake.

598
00:43:36,116 --> 00:43:38,869
Shut up, Edmund.

599
00:43:44,124 --> 00:43:45,959
You have lived here long time?

600
00:43:45,959 --> 00:43:50,255
Ten years or so. My late husband and
I came here to be with my aunt.

601
00:43:50,297 --> 00:43:52,925
We were the only family she had.

602
00:43:52,925 --> 00:43:57,471
- Ah yes. Madame Llewellyn-Smythe?
- That's right.

603
00:43:57,513 --> 00:44:00,182
- And then poor Daddy died.
- Oh!

604
00:44:00,182 --> 00:44:01,725
Run down by a motor car.

605
00:44:01,725 --> 00:44:05,562
Some youths going at a reckless speed.

606
00:44:05,938 --> 00:44:10,317
And when Aunt Louise passed
away, the house came to us.

607
00:44:10,984 --> 00:44:14,321
Although there was a moment
when we feared it wouldn't.

608
00:44:14,321 --> 00:44:20,077
All that fuss with that wretched Babushka?
What was she called? Molotov?

609
00:44:20,118 --> 00:44:22,663
Don't pretend you don't
remember Olga's name.

610
00:44:22,663 --> 00:44:26,041
Poor ignorant girI.
I felt rather sorry for her.

611
00:44:26,083 --> 00:44:29,419
- I didn't! What a bitch!
- Language, Frances!

612
00:44:29,419 --> 00:44:31,922
At least Olga was genuinely
fond of Aunt Louise.

613
00:44:31,922 --> 00:44:34,842
Unlike you! You were always snapping at her.

614
00:44:34,842 --> 00:44:37,135
She thought you were a snivelling
little mummy's boy -

615
00:44:37,135 --> 00:44:39,763
Children!

616
00:44:41,348 --> 00:44:43,600
- I'll fetch the port.
- Madame.

617
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:47,271
Not entirely sure where it's got to,
now we no longer have a man about the house.

618
00:44:49,106 --> 00:44:51,817
Mrs Baker!

619
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:55,362
How is your investigation going, Mr Poirot?

620
00:44:55,362 --> 00:44:58,532
Do you really think Joyce
was telling the truth?

621
00:44:58,532 --> 00:45:01,618
Eh bien, there is still a murder not solved
here in Woodleigh Common, eh?

622
00:45:01,618 --> 00:45:05,497
That of M. Lesley Ferrier,
the clerk to the solicitor.

623
00:45:06,248 --> 00:45:10,043
And I believe that he was a close
acquaintance of yours, mademoiselle?

624
00:45:10,085 --> 00:45:16,008
Lesley had certain attractions
but he was deeply unsuitable.

625
00:45:16,049 --> 00:45:19,928
You spent most of the time consumed by
the green-eyed monster, didn't you, sis?

626
00:45:21,513 --> 00:45:25,184
Anyway, it was all over between
us when it happened.

627
00:45:26,185 --> 00:45:30,814
All over. Yes. I can still hear
the smashing of crockery!

628
00:45:30,856 --> 00:45:37,571
Success! A vintage tawny. Bottled
the year of Queen Victoria's jubilee.

629
00:45:38,572 --> 00:45:43,660
What do you say, monsieur? A quick snifter
and then a bracing stroll in the garden?

630
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:53,587
It's a deviI to keep up,
but Aunt Louise loved it so...

631
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:57,508
- Oh, really, it's intolerable.
- Mother -

632
00:45:57,508 --> 00:46:01,011
He loiters. It's unnerving. Well, I
shan't stand for it any longer!

633
00:46:01,011 --> 00:46:02,095
Mummy! Don't!

634
00:46:02,095 --> 00:46:04,723
You! Get away from this house!
You are not welcome here!

635
00:46:04,723 --> 00:46:06,058
I beg your pardon?

636
00:46:06,058 --> 00:46:08,352
I've made it perfectly
clear to you, Mr Garfield,

637
00:46:08,352 --> 00:46:12,981
on numerous occasions that I do not approve
of you hanging around in this fashion.

638
00:46:13,023 --> 00:46:16,902
I'm afraid I can't help it.
It's such a lovely view.

639
00:46:18,612 --> 00:46:23,909
So, if you don't mind, I think I might go
and tend my Aster oblongifolius.

640
00:46:24,701 --> 00:46:27,287
Ta-ta.

641
00:46:27,287 --> 00:46:29,206
There's something I don't like about that man.

642
00:46:29,206 --> 00:46:32,960
Something uncanny.
I wouldn't be at all surprised if...

643
00:46:33,001 --> 00:46:38,215
No, no Madame. MichaeI Garfield is not
responsible for the death of Joyce Reynolds.

644
00:46:39,174 --> 00:46:40,926
e was in Athens at the time.

645
00:46:40,926 --> 00:46:45,597
Poirot he has already checked. And the
sources of Poirot, they are impeccable.

646
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:03,240
Oh. It's you.

647
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:08,412
Not surprised you'm jumpy.
Not surprised at all.

648
00:47:08,453 --> 00:47:12,124
- Can I help you?
- Jeyes' fluid?

649
00:47:12,124 --> 00:47:14,001
You can't have got through
the last lot already?

650
00:47:14,001 --> 00:47:17,671
Well, I daresay I could
make it go a bit further.

651
00:47:21,133 --> 00:47:24,887
That foreigner's been to see me.
Asking questions.

652
00:47:24,928 --> 00:47:25,888
Really?

653
00:47:25,888 --> 00:47:29,725
He was particularly interested
in that Olga of yours.

654
00:47:29,766 --> 00:47:31,185
Hardly mine.

655
00:47:31,185 --> 00:47:34,605
Well, you was the one that organised
all them girls to come over here.

656
00:47:34,605 --> 00:47:36,398
And there hasn't been
one since. Has there?

657
00:47:36,398 --> 00:47:40,402
I discontinued the scheme. Olga let me down.

658
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:43,322
She let us all down.

659
00:47:43,322 --> 00:47:47,117
I always wondered, though.
What you got out of it?

660
00:47:48,327 --> 00:47:49,620
What on Earth do you mean?

661
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:54,082
Well, putting all them waifs into service.
What was in it for you?

662
00:47:54,124 --> 00:47:57,836
My Christian duty. Nothing more.

663
00:47:57,836 --> 00:48:01,131
Obviously there were one
or two minor expenses.

664
00:48:01,131 --> 00:48:05,052
I'll bid you good night, then. Sweet dreams.

665
00:48:07,346 --> 00:48:10,891
Oh and if you can remember
that disinfectant, vicar.

666
00:48:10,891 --> 00:48:14,645
This old place needs a thorough clean out.

667
00:49:48,155 --> 00:49:49,656
It's this wretched fever.

668
00:49:49,656 --> 00:49:52,993
That's why I've only just remembered.
About the Hallowe'en party.

669
00:49:52,993 --> 00:49:56,997
Je vous emplore, Madame! Calmez-vous
and tell to Poirot what has occurred.

670
00:49:58,207 --> 00:50:00,918
Well, it was during that
silly Snapdragon game.

671
00:50:00,918 --> 00:50:05,047
Great fun, I'm sure but I was dead on
my feet by then and it got awfully hot...

672
00:50:09,384 --> 00:50:13,597
...so I went out into the hall.
And there I saw Mrs Drake.

673
00:50:16,808 --> 00:50:19,394
- Oh you're drenched!
- What a clumsy thing you must think me.

674
00:50:19,394 --> 00:50:21,104
No, no. It could happen to us all.

675
00:50:21,104 --> 00:50:24,024
Mustn't let the children run about in
their stockinged feet. I'll fetch a brush.

676
00:50:24,024 --> 00:50:25,609
What do you think had happened to startle her?

677
00:50:25,609 --> 00:50:29,863
She saw something. Must have done.
But here's the thing.

678
00:50:30,697 --> 00:50:33,450
She was looking towards the library.
You understand?

679
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:34,535
Oui.

680
00:50:34,535 --> 00:50:37,829
Where Joyce was found not long after.

681
00:50:37,829 --> 00:50:41,250
Maybe she saw someone
she didn't expect to see.

682
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:45,045
- And did you yourself see there anyone?
- No.

683
00:50:45,087 --> 00:50:47,339
It is strange because Mdm Drake
she does not strike me as

684
00:50:47,339 --> 00:50:50,717
a woman that could be startled easily.
You concur?

685
00:50:50,717 --> 00:50:53,846
I most certainly do.

686
00:51:08,443 --> 00:51:11,989
It ain't me you should be scared of, missus!

687
00:51:11,989 --> 00:51:16,034
Look to yourself!
Bloody curse there is on you!

688
00:51:16,285 --> 00:51:17,578
Come on, Leopold.

689
00:51:17,578 --> 00:51:23,000
First your husband. Then your little girI.
Even your lodger!

690
00:51:23,041 --> 00:51:28,463
All dead and mouldering in their graves.
Who's next? Hey?

691
00:51:35,637 --> 00:51:39,266
Madame Drake, I understand that
during the party, you met with an accident?

692
00:51:39,266 --> 00:51:41,810
- Accident?
- The vase that was dropped?

693
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:45,898
Oh, that! That was very irritating.

694
00:51:46,648 --> 00:51:49,943
I'd noticed earlier that
the flowers needed water.

695
00:51:49,943 --> 00:51:53,488
The party was in full swing so
I took the vase down

696
00:51:53,488 --> 00:51:55,741
to the downstairs cloakroom and filled it up.

697
00:51:55,741 --> 00:51:58,619
Next thing you know, it had
slipped out of my hands!

698
00:51:58,619 --> 00:52:00,746
DreadfuI mess all over the hall.

699
00:52:00,746 --> 00:52:05,042
Very stupid of me. I felt an awfuI fooI
in front of our guest of honour.

700
00:52:05,083 --> 00:52:06,376
- Madame Oliver?
- Yes.

701
00:52:06,376 --> 00:52:09,129
It was she that thought that
something startled you

702
00:52:09,129 --> 00:52:12,799
or it was something unexpected that you saw?

703
00:52:14,176 --> 00:52:17,888
No, I didn't see anything unexpected.

704
00:52:18,222 --> 00:52:21,350
What would there have been to see?
Everyone was playing Snapdragon.

705
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:25,437
You did not see perhaps someone
to open the door of the library?

706
00:52:25,479 --> 00:52:27,272
The library door? No, of course not.

707
00:52:27,272 --> 00:52:30,359
You are certain Madame? It is unwise
to conceaI matters from Poirot.

708
00:52:30,359 --> 00:52:33,487
I am not accustomed to being
accused of Iying, Monsieur.

709
00:52:33,487 --> 00:52:36,823
Non, non, non, pas du tout,
Madame pas du tout...

710
00:52:36,823 --> 00:52:40,202
There may be an explanation
quite innocent for all of this.

711
00:52:40,244 --> 00:52:43,580
But you must realise Madame,
that if you glimpsed someone

712
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:47,417
in the library at that moment,

713
00:52:47,584 --> 00:52:49,336
you may well have seen the murderer!

714
00:52:49,336 --> 00:52:54,424
And by remaining silent you would be placing
yourself in the periI most considerable.

715
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:58,512
I am touched by your concern,
Monsieur Poirot.

716
00:52:58,512 --> 00:53:03,225
But rest assured, I am in no danger.
No danger at all.

717
00:53:09,731 --> 00:53:13,527
D'you know, I think it's turning chillier.

718
00:53:20,117 --> 00:53:22,286
I don't know how you can stand to be in here.

719
00:53:22,286 --> 00:53:26,081
I'm incurably morbid. Or hadn't you heard?

720
00:53:26,248 --> 00:53:28,500
What are you reading?

721
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:31,253
Fascinating stuff. The Old Religion.

722
00:53:31,253 --> 00:53:33,922
What about it?

723
00:53:33,964 --> 00:53:37,176
Some practices haven't died out like
they have in the cities, you know.

724
00:53:37,176 --> 00:53:40,596
Practices? You mean the way Joyce was...

725
00:53:40,596 --> 00:53:44,558
"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live!"

726
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:54,568
Oh. Hello. Monsieur Poirot.

727
00:53:54,568 --> 00:53:56,403
Ah! Mademoiselle Butler.

728
00:53:56,403 --> 00:54:00,115
Now, you should not be out here
on your own. Your maman -

729
00:54:00,157 --> 00:54:03,911
Oh, I'm perfectly safe. I love it here.

730
00:54:04,369 --> 00:54:06,663
Oui. It is glorious.

731
00:54:06,663 --> 00:54:11,877
Nobody knows where I am, you see, when
I come here. I sit in the trees and watch.

732
00:54:13,337 --> 00:54:16,131
I like that. Watching things happen.

733
00:54:16,131 --> 00:54:18,509
And what is it that you watch, Madamoiselle?

734
00:54:18,509 --> 00:54:22,387
- Birds and squirrels and that sort of thing.
- And people?

735
00:54:22,763 --> 00:54:26,725
Sometimes. But not many people come here.

736
00:54:29,394 --> 00:54:31,522
What is it, mademoiselle?

737
00:54:31,522 --> 00:54:34,441
- Well, I was just thinking about Joyce.
- Ah.

738
00:54:34,441 --> 00:54:38,403
I'll miss her. We used to share secrets.

739
00:54:38,904 --> 00:54:41,782
But she never told to you about
the "murder" that she saw?

740
00:54:41,782 --> 00:54:45,661
No. Joyce never told me she'd seen a murder.

741
00:54:59,758 --> 00:55:01,093
One codiciI.

742
00:55:01,093 --> 00:55:04,137
Merci. It is most kind of you, Inspector.

743
00:55:04,137 --> 00:55:05,681
Kindness doesn't come into it.

744
00:55:05,681 --> 00:55:09,685
Seems like you've got friends in high
places. Friends at the Yard.

745
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:12,354
It is just as was told to Poirot.

746
00:55:12,354 --> 00:55:16,900
Madame Llewellyn-Smythe leaves the whole
estate to the au pair Olga Seminoff.

747
00:55:16,942 --> 00:55:20,612
FarcicaI, of course. It's a forgery.
Not a very good one at that.

748
00:55:20,654 --> 00:55:24,283
And the signatures of the witnesses,
a Mr and Mrs James Jenkins.

749
00:55:24,283 --> 00:55:26,660
- The odd-job man and his missus.
- Ah?

750
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:29,413
Emigrated to Australia just
after the old woman died.

751
00:55:29,413 --> 00:55:30,706
And were they contacted?

752
00:55:30,706 --> 00:55:32,332
- No point.
- Non?

753
00:55:32,332 --> 00:55:36,378
The signatures were checked.
Forged. Like the rest of it.

754
00:55:42,301 --> 00:55:46,138
It is possible for Poirot to examine
the belongings of Lesley Ferrier?

755
00:55:46,972 --> 00:55:50,809
Why not? It's like bloody
Liberty hall round here.

756
00:56:19,922 --> 00:56:22,674
Such disarrangement.

757
00:56:28,388 --> 00:56:31,850
Yes, that's the codiciI all right.
The forgery.

758
00:56:31,850 --> 00:56:35,562
- Non, Monsieur. You are mistaken.
- I can assure you -

759
00:56:35,604 --> 00:56:38,982
Non, non, non, Monsieur. This is the
codiciI that was given to me

760
00:56:38,982 --> 00:56:42,194
by the Inspector Raglan
and it was this document

761
00:56:42,194 --> 00:56:46,156
that was examined by the experts
and declared to be the fake.

762
00:56:47,699 --> 00:56:48,825
What's this then?

763
00:56:48,825 --> 00:56:51,119
That is the codiciI that I discovered
amongst the personaI

764
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:54,873
belongings of your former
employee Lesley Ferrier.

765
00:56:57,793 --> 00:56:59,878
Were you aware, monsieur... Fullerton,

766
00:56:59,878 --> 00:57:03,549
that amongst the other petty
misdemeanours of Lesley Ferrier,

767
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:08,554
one of his convictions was a three month
sentence in prison for forgery?

768
00:57:08,595 --> 00:57:14,685
Good Lord. So Olga Seminoff
got him to forge the codiciI?

769
00:57:14,726 --> 00:57:17,688
It certainly appears so.

770
00:57:22,526 --> 00:57:24,820
- Now this is odd.
- Pourquoi?

771
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:28,073
I'm no expert but it seems
to me that Ferrier has made

772
00:57:28,073 --> 00:57:31,827
a far betterjob on this one than
the one he sent to me.

773
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:06,111
- Good evening Mrs Drake.
- Good evening.

774
00:59:00,582 --> 00:59:03,544
You idiot! You scared me half to death!

775
00:59:03,544 --> 00:59:06,505
Guy Fawkes night is almost upon us,
Mrs Drake.

776
00:59:06,505 --> 00:59:09,550
That's all. There's no need to be scared.

777
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:30,195
Oh God! Oh God!

778
00:59:41,999 --> 00:59:44,459
Just like his blessed sister.

779
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:53,802
Inspector?

780
00:59:54,261 --> 00:59:57,931
Do you still search for your lunatic
who has escaped?

781
00:59:57,931 --> 01:00:01,602
All right, Mr Poirot. I give in.
Help me out, will you?

782
01:00:03,979 --> 01:00:06,648
So now you wish to involve Poirot
in your detection 'modern'?

783
01:00:06,648 --> 01:00:09,484
I'II listen to anyone right now.

784
01:00:10,569 --> 01:00:14,239
- Un moment.
- Of course.

785
01:00:22,414 --> 01:00:24,958
Mademoiselle.

786
01:00:24,958 --> 01:00:28,962
A discovery most distressing, n'est pas?

787
01:00:29,087 --> 01:00:35,886
Brought it all back. Beatrice.
This is where they found her.

788
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:42,392
And the death of madamoiselle Beatrice White,
it was not an accident, was it, mademoiselle?

789
01:00:42,434 --> 01:00:44,853
I've told you before.
Beatrice wasn't murdered!

790
01:00:44,853 --> 01:00:47,981
Non, non, non. Not murdered.

791
01:00:47,981 --> 01:00:51,109
But Poirot he has considered what
you told to him in the churchyard.

792
01:00:51,109 --> 01:00:54,363
I cared for her very deeply, monsieur.

793
01:00:54,363 --> 01:00:58,158
And I only discovered how much she
cared when it was too late.

794
01:00:59,159 --> 01:01:04,248
"When it was too late". How did
you discover her feelings?

795
01:01:04,289 --> 01:01:07,668
- I...
- There was a note, was there not?

796
01:01:10,045 --> 01:01:12,756
And she took her own life?

797
01:01:12,756 --> 01:01:15,968
God knows I thought she was happy enough.

798
01:01:16,176 --> 01:01:20,722
But Beatrice... Beatrice could
never reconcile herself

799
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:26,645
to her true nature.
Could never love me the way...

800
01:01:29,147 --> 01:01:32,317
I didn't tell the police about the note.

801
01:01:32,359 --> 01:01:38,031
I wanted to save her from the finaI indignity.
An unconsecrated grave.

802
01:01:40,075 --> 01:01:43,203
I thought I could do that for her at least.

803
01:01:44,413 --> 01:01:48,959
If only we could have been left alone.
Left in peace.

804
01:02:00,053 --> 01:02:03,849
Job, Reverend Cottrell. Job was afflicted...
by the Lord. Just like me.

805
01:02:03,891 --> 01:02:06,560
He had everything taken away from him.

806
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:09,813
Indeed, dear lady. These things
are sent to try us.

807
01:02:09,813 --> 01:02:13,775
It's His will. First he took
my Albert from me, then Joyce.

808
01:02:13,817 --> 01:02:17,738
Now dear Leopold has been called to him.

809
01:02:20,949 --> 01:02:24,036
Reverend Cottrell. Madame. You have my...

810
01:02:24,036 --> 01:02:28,582
"The fire of God is fallen from heaven,
and hath burned up the sheep,

811
01:02:28,624 --> 01:02:35,797
and the servants, and consumed them;
and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. "

812
01:02:44,389 --> 01:02:48,185
Isn't it dreadfuI? Quite dreadfuI.

813
01:02:48,185 --> 01:02:50,938
Yes, indeed.

814
01:02:51,146 --> 01:02:55,859
- Reverend Cottrell, a word with you if I may.
- Of course.

815
01:02:55,901 --> 01:02:58,111
Madame Goodbody tells to me
that you were responsible

816
01:02:58,111 --> 01:03:01,281
for the presence of Olga Seminoff
here in Woodleigh Common.

817
01:03:01,281 --> 01:03:07,454
Olga? Yes. I started a little scheme.
Sort of missionary work in reverse!

818
01:03:07,496 --> 01:03:08,455
Indeed?

819
01:03:08,455 --> 01:03:13,418
I visited Czechoslovakia some time ago
and forged links with some churches there.

820
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:17,464
Various families were eager that their
daughters should better themselves.

821
01:03:17,506 --> 01:03:20,843
Seek opportunities in this country.
I was happy to help.

822
01:03:20,843 --> 01:03:23,178
And Olga Seminoff, she was one of them?

823
01:03:23,178 --> 01:03:28,225
Yes. I managed to find a position for
her with Mrs Llewellyn-Smythe.

824
01:03:28,267 --> 01:03:30,269
That is most worthy of you, monsieur.

825
01:03:30,269 --> 01:03:35,190
Well, I did my best.
Tried to keep a pastoraI eye on her.

826
01:03:36,358 --> 01:03:40,279
And this scheme of charity,
it no longer operates?

827
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:45,534
No. Olga's disappearance rather brought
it to a shuddering halt.

828
01:03:47,286 --> 01:03:50,414
Her parents are still writing to me!
Blaming me for heaven's sake!

829
01:03:50,414 --> 01:03:51,832
Blaming you?

830
01:03:51,832 --> 01:03:55,878
Well, she's never been in touch, you see.
Never returned home.

831
01:03:57,337 --> 01:04:03,218
Two years, it's been now. Hardly my fault.
The girI was trouble, monsieur.

832
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:05,304
Why do you say that?

833
01:04:05,304 --> 01:04:10,475
Well, I can't claim to know all the details
but Mrs Llewellyn-Smythe

834
01:04:10,517 --> 01:04:13,228
did come and see me one
night in a terrible state...

835
01:04:13,228 --> 01:04:14,855
It's all because of Olga, you see.

836
01:04:14,855 --> 01:04:16,315
My dear lady, what has she done?

837
01:04:16,315 --> 01:04:18,901
There is so much wickedness in the world.
It's really most upsetting.

838
01:04:18,901 --> 01:04:20,444
Whatever's the matter?

839
01:04:20,444 --> 01:04:22,529
Can it be true? If it is then
I have no choice.

840
01:04:22,529 --> 01:04:25,782
I'll have to involve the police.
But, oh, the scandaI.

841
01:04:25,782 --> 01:04:26,825
Would you like me to speak to her?

842
01:04:26,825 --> 01:04:30,621
No. No, forget I came to you.
I'll deaI with it in my own way.

843
01:04:33,874 --> 01:04:35,709
At the time I didn't know
what she was on about.

844
01:04:35,709 --> 01:04:39,755
But when all that business about
the forged codiciI came to light,

845
01:04:40,714 --> 01:04:45,177
Olga was a wrong 'un. That's all
there is to it.

846
01:04:47,846 --> 01:04:50,307
I wonder where she is now.

847
01:04:51,975 --> 01:04:56,021
I... I didn't know what to do, you see.

848
01:04:57,898 --> 01:05:01,818
Yes. You're right. It was me.

849
01:05:04,363 --> 01:05:06,698
Sacrifices are sometimes necessary.

850
01:05:06,698 --> 01:05:09,368
I see that now.

851
01:05:09,743 --> 01:05:12,246
There's someone at the door.

852
01:05:31,014 --> 01:05:35,727
- Mrs Drake's just heard. About poor Leopold.
- Ah...

853
01:05:36,687 --> 01:05:41,024
I shall never forgive myself!
Of course you were right, Monsieur.

854
01:05:41,733 --> 01:05:47,239
I ought to have told you what I saw.
But I thought... I thought...

855
01:05:48,490 --> 01:05:52,202
Calmez-vous, Madame. Tell all to Poirot.

856
01:05:52,202 --> 01:05:55,998
I thought I was acting for the best!
You must believe me.

857
01:05:56,123 --> 01:06:02,129
And now... if only I'd told you,
maybe we could have saved him.

858
01:06:02,171 --> 01:06:05,215
Begin at the beginning, Madame.

859
01:06:11,889 --> 01:06:16,435
I did see something. That night.
In the hallway.

860
01:06:18,937 --> 01:06:24,526
The library... door opened rather
carefully... and I saw him.

861
01:06:25,694 --> 01:06:29,156
- Whom did you see Madame?
- Leopold.

862
01:06:29,156 --> 01:06:30,282
Ah.

863
01:06:30,282 --> 01:06:34,369
Of course, it startled me. I though the was
playing Snapdragon with the others.

864
01:06:35,162 --> 01:06:40,792
And what's more... he had such
a queer look on his face.

865
01:06:42,794 --> 01:06:46,882
He was always rather a strange boy.
Not quite right, you know.

866
01:06:48,425 --> 01:06:52,554
The way he looked, it upset me.
And that's why I dropped the vase.

867
01:06:52,596 --> 01:06:54,848
Oh dear, you're drenched.

868
01:06:54,848 --> 01:06:57,309
What a clumsy thing you must think me.

869
01:06:57,309 --> 01:07:00,979
I didn't think anything of it at the time.
It was only later.

870
01:07:02,189 --> 01:07:06,443
Later, when we found Joyce
that I began to think it over...

871
01:07:06,485 --> 01:07:10,113
And of course you concluded
that master Leopold,

872
01:07:10,197 --> 01:07:12,491
he killed his sister, n'est-ce pas?

873
01:07:12,491 --> 01:07:15,452
God help me, I did.

874
01:07:15,536 --> 01:07:20,040
And then when you came
and questioned me about things

875
01:07:20,082 --> 01:07:23,961
I couldn't say anything. He's so young.

876
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:29,091
Was so young. He couldn't have
known what he was doing.

877
01:07:31,343 --> 01:07:36,473
I suppose I had a half-baked notion that
I could get treatment for him.

878
01:07:37,641 --> 01:07:41,520
Not have him sent to some
dreadfuI institution.

879
01:07:41,562 --> 01:07:43,105
I understand, Madame.

880
01:07:43,105 --> 01:07:47,067
His being killed must mean
something quite different.

881
01:07:48,110 --> 01:07:52,489
He must have gone in there
and found Joyce dead.

882
01:07:53,699 --> 01:07:57,327
And that must have given him
the most awfuI shock.

883
01:07:57,327 --> 01:08:01,790
Not because he'd killed her
but because he'd found her.

884
01:08:03,959 --> 01:08:09,965
Oh God. Who can have done
these dreadfuI things?

885
01:08:10,007 --> 01:08:13,719
Poirot will discover all Madame.

886
01:08:14,553 --> 01:08:17,347
It will not be long now.

887
01:08:20,767 --> 01:08:24,646
So that's the schooI-teacher out of
the picture. Where does that leave us?

888
01:08:24,688 --> 01:08:28,567
The poisoned old lady?
Or the solicitor's clerk?

889
01:08:31,778 --> 01:08:34,281
- Cocoa anyone?
- Non, merci, Madame.

890
01:08:34,281 --> 01:08:37,618
What do you think, Judith? How much
did Rowena Drake disapprove

891
01:08:37,618 --> 01:08:40,537
of her daughter's liaison with a crook
like Ferrier? Enough to kill?

892
01:08:40,537 --> 01:08:42,331
- Well...
- Or could Mrs Reynolds

893
01:08:42,331 --> 01:08:45,459
have been secretly attracted
to her lodger all along?

894
01:08:45,459 --> 01:08:48,378
And where has Olga Seminoff got to?

895
01:08:48,378 --> 01:08:51,381
It occurred to me the vicar might be shielding her!

896
01:08:51,381 --> 01:08:55,511
Then there's Mrs Goodbody, well, she's just odd.

897
01:08:55,552 --> 01:08:59,890
Je vous implore, Madame! This is not one
of your detective fictions.

898
01:08:59,932 --> 01:09:02,518
We must deaI here only with the truth.

899
01:09:02,518 --> 01:09:04,978
- I'm only trying to help.
- I know you are, Ariadne.

900
01:09:04,978 --> 01:09:08,649
The finaI piece of this puzzle,
it eludes Poirot still.

901
01:09:11,527 --> 01:09:15,697
The victim. One must always return
to the victim. For their personality,

902
01:09:15,739 --> 01:09:18,617
their nature, it is the key.

903
01:09:18,617 --> 01:09:21,578
What has everybody told to Poirot
about Madamoiselle Joyce Reynolds?

904
01:09:21,578 --> 01:09:24,248
She is a liar. A teller of the tall tales.

905
01:09:24,248 --> 01:09:27,876
A boaster. A little liar. So when
she claims to have witnessed a murder,

906
01:09:27,876 --> 01:09:34,466
nobody believes her. And yet, she is dead.

907
01:09:36,552 --> 01:09:39,012
Monsieur?

908
01:09:39,012 --> 01:09:42,808
I have been an imbecile three
times over! An imbecile!

909
01:09:42,850 --> 01:09:46,478
- It was there all along! The maharajah!
- What?

910
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:49,022
Tigers, mesdames! Elephants!

911
01:09:49,022 --> 01:09:50,691
I remember her uncle had been to India...

912
01:09:50,691 --> 01:09:52,067
...The story got added to every time...

913
01:09:52,067 --> 01:09:53,402
And she hadn't even been!

914
01:09:53,402 --> 01:09:57,573
She had not even been!
She appropriated the story.

915
01:09:59,908 --> 01:10:03,370
A murder that was witnessed by someone else!

916
01:10:03,537 --> 01:10:06,081
Someone with whom she shared her secrets!

917
01:10:06,081 --> 01:10:07,833
Miranda?

918
01:10:07,833 --> 01:10:11,879
Your daughter Madame,
she is in the danger most terrible.

919
01:10:14,173 --> 01:10:16,300
Miranda!

920
01:10:21,138 --> 01:10:25,142
- Miranda!
- Sacre! I only hope we are in time!

921
01:10:27,811 --> 01:10:30,439
Are you sure Mummy won't be worried?

922
01:10:32,608 --> 01:10:34,902
Merci beaucoup Inspector.

923
01:10:35,319 --> 01:10:38,989
- He will meet us there!
- Come on, Ariadne!

924
01:10:46,997 --> 01:10:50,792
It's so beautifuI. It's bright as day.

925
01:10:56,048 --> 01:10:58,634
You do look funny.

926
01:11:07,768 --> 01:11:11,522
I don't mind if you laugh. No-one can hear.

927
01:11:15,442 --> 01:11:17,778
Shall we?

928
01:11:30,082 --> 01:11:37,339
You know people used to worship here?
The Sun and the Moon and the stars.

929
01:11:38,924 --> 01:11:41,760
And they used to sacrifice things as well.

930
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:45,806
I've explained to you about sacrifice,
haven't I?

931
01:11:46,223 --> 01:11:51,061
I have to die so that others might
live. So that beauty can live.

932
01:11:51,103 --> 01:11:52,312
That's right.

933
01:11:52,312 --> 01:11:56,525
What I saw, was that a sacrifice too?

934
01:11:56,567 --> 01:11:58,402
In a way.

935
01:11:58,402 --> 01:12:01,864
And Joyce and Leopold?

936
01:12:04,032 --> 01:12:06,451
Is it time?

937
01:12:06,451 --> 01:12:08,620
Yes.

938
01:12:08,704 --> 01:12:14,334
And now you and I will drink
to the past and the future...

939
01:12:20,924 --> 01:12:22,301
...and to beauty.

940
01:12:22,301 --> 01:12:26,096
That'll be nice. What does it taste of?

941
01:12:27,681 --> 01:12:32,394
It'll taste of whatever you want it to.
It's magicaI, you see. It's quite magicaI.

942
01:12:33,312 --> 01:12:36,982
You remember what I said, Miranda?
About returning to nature?

943
01:12:37,816 --> 01:12:40,402
Look at the Moon.

944
01:12:41,236 --> 01:12:44,907
And you will be there soon.

945
01:12:46,491 --> 01:12:50,579
Up there amongst the cold stars.

946
01:12:52,206 --> 01:12:54,833
ImmortaI.

947
01:12:55,250 --> 01:12:59,046
Now you hold the cup and drink.

948
01:13:02,674 --> 01:13:04,801
Drink!

949
01:13:11,266 --> 01:13:13,435
Drink to beauty, Miranda!

950
01:13:13,435 --> 01:13:17,439
Non! Never! Jamais, Monsieur Garfield!

951
01:13:19,525 --> 01:13:21,693
Catch him!

952
01:13:31,203 --> 01:13:35,040
You're right of course. Joyce just
repeated what I'd told her.

953
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:38,710
I suppose she wanted to impress everyone.

954
01:13:38,710 --> 01:13:40,879
And, alas, it cost her her life.

955
01:13:40,879 --> 01:13:44,591
But you are now safe, ma petite.

956
01:13:44,591 --> 01:13:47,386
Tell to Poirot what you saw.

957
01:13:47,845 --> 01:13:50,305
I thought it must have been
an accident, you see.

958
01:13:50,305 --> 01:13:55,185
And nobody said anything the next day so
I sort ofjust forgot about it.

959
01:13:56,937 --> 01:14:00,649
I'd been by myself reading in
the garden when I spotted MichaeI.

960
01:14:01,733 --> 01:14:05,988
I was going to wave then I noticed he was
dragging something. It was a body.

961
01:14:07,030 --> 01:14:10,826
But why didn't you tell anyone, Miranda? Why?

962
01:14:10,993 --> 01:14:16,206
I thought it might have been a sacrifice.
MichaeI told me sacrifices are necessary.

963
01:14:16,999 --> 01:14:21,753
It was only today that he guessed. Guessed
that it was me, not Joyce, that had seen him.

964
01:14:23,839 --> 01:14:28,218
The thing is, I never even told Joyce it was
MichaeI. Just that I'd seen a murder.

965
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:31,597
But whose body was it?

966
01:14:31,597 --> 01:14:33,765
I don't know. I couldn't tell.

967
01:14:33,765 --> 01:14:37,603
But I don't understand. He couldn't
have killed Joyce, could he?

968
01:14:38,061 --> 01:14:40,772
I thought he was in Greece.

969
01:14:42,107 --> 01:14:46,153
Well, my men and I'll be off, Mr Poirot.
Get Garfield down to the station.

970
01:14:46,528 --> 01:14:49,198
Bon, Inspector.

971
01:14:51,533 --> 01:14:55,454
And perhaps it is time we were
all of us in our beds, non?

972
01:14:56,205 --> 01:14:58,540
Yes, it's time. Come on. Yes.

973
01:14:58,540 --> 01:15:02,503
Or perhaps it is time for Poirot to
tell to you a story.

974
01:15:03,921 --> 01:15:07,716
A Hallowe'en story!

975
01:15:13,472 --> 01:15:18,602
"It was a dark and stormy night!"

976
01:15:20,604 --> 01:15:23,440
Is that not how one should begin?

977
01:15:24,149 --> 01:15:29,446
And such, indeed, was the night of the
Hallowe'en Party here in this very house.

978
01:15:30,155 --> 01:15:35,202
A little girI claims "I saw a murder once".

979
01:15:36,954 --> 01:15:41,500
But which murder was this? The stabbing of
Lesley Ferrier, the clerk to the solicitor?

980
01:15:42,125 --> 01:15:44,545
The drowning of the teacher
madamoiselle Beatrice White?

981
01:15:44,545 --> 01:15:49,132
Or could it be that the elderly Madame
Llewellyn-Smythe was in fact poisoned?

982
01:15:49,174 --> 01:15:52,219
Poisoned?

983
01:15:52,219 --> 01:15:55,931
But all of those people including
Aunt Louise are Iying in the churchyard!

984
01:15:55,973 --> 01:15:58,183
They're certainly not in our garden!

985
01:15:58,183 --> 01:16:00,769
Precisement, Monsieur Drake.

986
01:16:00,769 --> 01:16:02,646
In fact there is only one person
who has disappeared

987
01:16:02,646 --> 01:16:05,107
from Woodleigh Common and whose
whereabouts are not known.

988
01:16:05,107 --> 01:16:10,612
And Poirot believes that the poor souI who
lies buried in this garden so beautifuI...

989
01:16:12,364 --> 01:16:19,955
...is the foreigner sans amis, without
a friend, the au pair Olga Seminoff!

990
01:16:20,789 --> 01:16:24,835
Nonsense. Olga left the village
after that stunt with the codiciI.

991
01:16:24,877 --> 01:16:29,548
Oui. The codiciI that everyone
thought was a forgery.

992
01:16:29,590 --> 01:16:35,053
And indeed this one, it is.

993
01:16:37,598 --> 01:16:42,477
This one it is the article genuine.

994
01:16:46,106 --> 01:16:49,902
You mean, Mrs Llewellyn-Smythe
did leave everything to Olga?

995
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:52,571
- Oui.
- Don't be silly.

996
01:16:52,571 --> 01:16:55,199
No, but it is true, Madame.

997
01:16:55,199 --> 01:16:58,535
The Reverend Cottrell told me of
a conversation he had with your aunt...

998
01:16:58,535 --> 01:16:59,953
Whatever's the matter?

999
01:16:59,953 --> 01:17:01,872
Can it be true? If it is then I've no choice.

1000
01:17:01,872 --> 01:17:05,000
I'll have to involve the police but,
oh the scandaI...

1001
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,337
And what scandaI was this?

1002
01:17:09,421 --> 01:17:13,467
Perhaps the au pair Olga Seminoff had
seen evidence of a love affair illicit?

1003
01:17:13,717 --> 01:17:17,387
A love affair between Ms MichaeI
Garfield the gardener of her employer

1004
01:17:17,429 --> 01:17:21,016
and someone who loved him
with every cell in their body.

1005
01:17:21,058 --> 01:17:25,437
Someone who was determined to have this
MichaeI Garfield no matter what the cost.

1006
01:17:26,313 --> 01:17:30,859
And it has led this little village
to become the slaughter-house.

1007
01:17:33,654 --> 01:17:37,324
Has it not... Madame Rowena Drake?

1008
01:17:42,246 --> 01:17:47,793
beg your pardon? Are you seriously
suggesting MichaeI Garfield and me?

1009
01:17:47,835 --> 01:17:49,962
Mummy can't stand MichaeI!

1010
01:17:49,962 --> 01:17:53,715
Once again, Monsieur Drake, precisement!

1011
01:17:56,385 --> 01:17:59,346
And it is this that first
caused Poirot to suspect.

1012
01:17:59,346 --> 01:18:02,516
To quote the Shakespeare, "Methinks
the lady doth protest too much!"

1013
01:18:02,516 --> 01:18:06,228
You loved him, Madame. You love him still.

1014
01:18:06,270 --> 01:18:10,607
And so you set out on your
campaign of butchery!

1015
01:18:11,692 --> 01:18:14,027
It's utterly crazy.

1016
01:18:14,027 --> 01:18:18,031
You think so? The "reckless youths"
who caused the death of your husband

1017
01:18:18,073 --> 01:18:21,702
they were never caught, were they, Madame?

1018
01:18:23,036 --> 01:18:25,372
So I wonder what the good Inspector
Raglan would discover

1019
01:18:25,372 --> 01:18:28,083
if he searches into the alibis
of yourself and MichaeI Garfield

1020
01:18:28,083 --> 01:18:30,127
on the day that your husband he died?

1021
01:18:30,127 --> 01:18:32,379
Did you plan to stop there, Madame?

1022
01:18:32,379 --> 01:18:34,631
Because now you are the widow hein?

1023
01:18:34,631 --> 01:18:39,261
But you are still financially
dependent upon your Aunt.

1024
01:18:40,929 --> 01:18:44,349
And you stand to inherit her house

1025
01:18:45,142 --> 01:18:48,103
and her garden if this old lady she dies.

1026
01:18:48,103 --> 01:18:51,607
And her health it is most poor so what
could be more naturaI than her heart

1027
01:18:51,607 --> 01:18:55,402
which is exhausted heart giving out?

1028
01:18:55,527 --> 01:18:58,488
But in the ointment, there is a fly!

1029
01:18:58,488 --> 01:19:03,660
Unbeknownst to you, the au pair Olga Seminoff

1030
01:19:03,702 --> 01:19:07,539
who had the devotion most genuine
towards you aunt,

1031
01:19:07,539 --> 01:19:11,293
has confided her suspicions
about your love affair.

1032
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:15,214
And Madame Llewellyn-Smythe believes her.

1033
01:19:15,214 --> 01:19:20,093
The "wickedness" which she spoke about to
the Reverend Cottrell was yours, Madame!

1034
01:19:21,220 --> 01:19:23,847
Is it then that Lesley Ferrier,
the crooked solicitor's clerk

1035
01:19:23,847 --> 01:19:26,642
contacts you and tells you
of the news so terrible

1036
01:19:26,642 --> 01:19:29,853
that your aunt has disinherited both
you and your children...

1037
01:19:29,853 --> 01:19:34,775
of neither of whom she is fond and left
everything to Olga Seminoff.

1038
01:19:35,359 --> 01:19:37,110
It is this.

1039
01:19:37,110 --> 01:19:42,157
The criminaI Ferrier will make another
version of the codiciI

1040
01:19:43,408 --> 01:19:46,703
substitute it for the originaI!

1041
01:19:46,912 --> 01:19:50,123
A fake so clumsy that any amount
of scrutiny will discredit

1042
01:19:50,123 --> 01:19:52,960
and the claim of Olga Seminoff will collapse.

1043
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:56,880
And of course you and MichaeI
Garfield agree to this plan.

1044
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:06,682
So the plan? And so now you
are free to dispose of your Aunt.

1045
01:20:06,682 --> 01:20:10,185
Upon her death, everything
goes according to plan.

1046
01:20:10,185 --> 01:20:16,233
The au pair Olga Seminoff
is dismissed as a gold-digger.

1047
01:20:16,275 --> 01:20:19,319
That this codiciI is now shown to be a lie.

1048
01:20:19,319 --> 01:20:23,198
So was it in desperation, that she
came to you, Madame Drake?

1049
01:20:23,282 --> 01:20:28,120
I know it! I know it in my bones!
You did away with her.

1050
01:20:28,161 --> 01:20:32,916
With my poor mistress - and with your
husband before that!

1051
01:20:32,958 --> 01:20:37,796
You're absolutely raving, girI! For
goodness' sake get a hold of yourself!

1052
01:20:37,838 --> 01:20:42,676
You do not deserve to live in this
beautifuI place! It is mine! It is mine...

1053
01:20:47,347 --> 01:20:51,351
And this tale of carnage... and horror...

1054
01:20:52,144 --> 01:20:54,563
it is not over, no, not even yet.

1055
01:20:54,563 --> 01:20:58,358
Lesley Ferrier is never to see
the rewards of his actions.

1056
01:20:59,109 --> 01:21:03,113
The concealing of the codiciI. Non!

1057
01:21:03,238 --> 01:21:05,365
Ferrier?

1058
01:21:05,365 --> 01:21:07,868
Mr Garfield.

1059
01:21:09,161 --> 01:21:11,663
It's all there I trust?

1060
01:21:12,831 --> 01:21:15,501
Pleasure doing business with you.

1061
01:21:18,128 --> 01:21:21,423
The pleasure is all mine.

1062
01:21:27,179 --> 01:21:32,434
Et alors, enfin, the two of you are now safe.

1063
01:21:34,937 --> 01:21:38,398
The house of your aunt, it is yours.
The money of your aunt, it is yours.

1064
01:21:38,398 --> 01:21:45,781
And, of course, the garden so
cherished it is your paradise.

1065
01:21:49,034 --> 01:21:52,079
But its soiI is drenched in
the blood of the innocent

1066
01:21:52,079 --> 01:21:57,125
and its fruit is black and bitter.

1067
01:21:58,377 --> 01:22:01,880
And what, two years later,
at a simple party for children

1068
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:05,425
you hear a young girI say that
she witnessed once a murder.

1069
01:22:05,425 --> 01:22:07,386
I saw a murder once.

1070
01:22:07,386 --> 01:22:11,181
And your heart that is so full of guilt...

1071
01:22:12,391 --> 01:22:16,144
...it leaps into your mouth.

1072
01:22:16,395 --> 01:22:18,397
Now, Joyce, what's all this about a murder?

1073
01:22:18,397 --> 01:22:22,067
- It's true! I really saw one!
- Where?

1074
01:22:22,150 --> 01:22:26,864
In... in your garden. I didn't realise
it then. But I know now.

1075
01:22:26,905 --> 01:22:30,492
Well, I'll believe you. Thousands wouldn't.

1076
01:22:30,492 --> 01:22:34,663
I bet you half a crown you can't get that
last apple out of the bucket!

1077
01:22:34,705 --> 01:22:38,500
- Oh, bet I can!
- Show me then!

1078
01:23:03,108 --> 01:23:05,986
And only after when this deed
so terrible it has been committed,

1079
01:23:05,986 --> 01:23:09,615
you realise that you are soaking wet.

1080
01:23:09,615 --> 01:23:13,327
No adult has played the game of,
what, the apple-bobbing.

1081
01:23:13,869 --> 01:23:17,080
So at once you realise how
suspicious it will appear.

1082
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:20,167
And so you devise a deception
also very clever

1083
01:23:20,167 --> 01:23:24,087
to explain away the soaking of your dress.

1084
01:23:24,129 --> 01:23:26,673
Oh dear, you're drenched!

1085
01:23:26,673 --> 01:23:28,592
What a clumsy thing you must think me!

1086
01:23:28,592 --> 01:23:34,806
You blame the accident on a glance directed
towards the door of the library.

1087
01:23:35,349 --> 01:23:38,435
A glance that was staged

1088
01:23:38,727 --> 01:23:41,355
and that you will use later to cast
suspicion elsewhere!

1089
01:23:41,355 --> 01:23:46,068
MichaeI Garfield he returns from Greece,
you tell to him what has occurred

1090
01:23:46,109 --> 01:23:50,113
and once again you consider yourselves
to be safe. Not so Madame.

1091
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:56,411
For you were observed to enter
the library with the little girI Joyce.

1092
01:23:56,453 --> 01:23:58,914
Now Joyce, what's all this about a murder?

1093
01:23:58,914 --> 01:24:02,709
- Oh, it's true. I really saw one.
- Where?

1094
01:24:02,751 --> 01:24:06,713
And Poirot himself has observed that

1095
01:24:08,090 --> 01:24:12,553
Master Leopold has unexpectedly become
"flush" with his pocket money

1096
01:24:12,594 --> 01:24:17,057
over the last few days. How so? Because
his silence it was being bought.

1097
01:24:18,809 --> 01:24:22,604
But Madame you are not sure for how
long and so you decide

1098
01:24:22,688 --> 01:24:26,733
to kill Master Leopold

1099
01:24:27,234 --> 01:24:32,489
and you use the glance towards the door
of the library to divert suspicion onto him.

1100
01:24:33,282 --> 01:24:37,077
He's so young. Was so young.

1101
01:24:38,287 --> 01:24:42,541
Another lie so callous to add
to your catalogue of deceit!

1102
01:24:48,213 --> 01:24:51,592
You idiot! You scared me half to death!

1103
01:24:51,592 --> 01:24:55,637
Guy Fawkes night is almost upon us, Mrs Drake.
That's all. There's no need to be scared.

1104
01:25:06,982 --> 01:25:10,736
- Is it done?
- It's done.

1105
01:25:12,404 --> 01:25:14,865
Do you still have the receipt?

1106
01:25:20,621 --> 01:25:24,416
- Good God.
- Mummy?

1107
01:25:25,501 --> 01:25:30,047
Well, really Monsieur! That was
quite a horror story!

1108
01:25:32,049 --> 01:25:34,968
Perhaps you will not sneer Madame
when we have exhumed the body

1109
01:25:34,968 --> 01:25:38,931
of Mdm Llewellyn-Smythe and examined
the contents of her stomach?

1110
01:25:39,181 --> 01:25:44,102
Or when this garden it is torn up to reveaI
the last resting place of Olga Seminoff?

1111
01:25:44,186 --> 01:25:48,232
Because this is where she lies, mes amis.
Make no mistake.

1112
01:25:48,774 --> 01:25:53,654
In the place where it is not remarkable that
the soiI it is continually freshly turned.

1113
01:25:56,782 --> 01:26:03,247
This garden with which MichaeI
Garfield is never satisfied.

1114
01:26:04,831 --> 01:26:07,626
His masterpiece!

1115
01:26:10,712 --> 01:26:13,215
Or, perhaps your composure
so absolute it will be shaken

1116
01:26:13,215 --> 01:26:17,845
when you hear from his very own lips
that MichaeI Garfield never loved you.

1117
01:26:23,642 --> 01:26:26,812
It's all over, I'm afraid, old thing.

1118
01:26:26,812 --> 01:26:28,939
I've no idea what he's talking about.

1119
01:26:28,939 --> 01:26:33,443
Indeed, I doubt that MichaeI Garfield
ever loved anybody but himself.

1120
01:26:34,778 --> 01:26:38,198
But he had a secret.

1121
01:26:38,448 --> 01:26:41,827
There had been someone else in his life.

1122
01:26:42,369 --> 01:26:44,872
nother lover.

1123
01:26:46,248 --> 01:26:50,252
Had there not? Madame Butler?

1124
01:26:54,965 --> 01:26:58,594
God help me, it's true. I did love him once.

1125
01:26:58,677 --> 01:27:02,472
And then I became afraid. His nature.
Even his passion for beauty and creation.

1126
01:27:02,514 --> 01:27:06,602
There was a sort of madness to it.
I never told him about Miranda.

1127
01:27:07,519 --> 01:27:10,856
Do you not think I guessed, Judith?

1128
01:27:13,901 --> 01:27:16,778
My beautifuI child.

1129
01:27:19,948 --> 01:27:23,160
No! No! NO! NO!

1130
01:27:23,452 --> 01:27:28,040
It's you I should have drowned! You filthy
little beast! It should have been you!

1131
01:27:28,081 --> 01:27:31,084
And you never had him! Never!

1132
01:27:31,084 --> 01:27:34,880
I'm the only one he ever wanted. Ever loved!

1133
01:27:36,298 --> 01:27:39,468
Say it isn't so. MichaeI! Please! Please!

1134
01:27:39,468 --> 01:27:42,846
Don't make a fuss, you silly creature.

1135
01:27:42,846 --> 01:27:46,558
It's so undignified. It's true.

1136
01:27:48,685 --> 01:27:52,147
I did it all for the money.

1137
01:27:52,648 --> 01:27:54,816
Of course I did.

1138
01:27:54,816 --> 01:27:58,445
And for the garden.

1139
01:27:58,445 --> 01:28:04,117
Actually I was thinking about buying
a little Greek island. Start afresh.

1140
01:28:04,159 --> 01:28:07,788
Noooooooo!

1141
01:28:10,332 --> 01:28:13,377
I just like pretty things, you see.

1142
01:28:13,585 --> 01:28:16,380
- Is that so wrong?
- No!

1143
01:28:16,380 --> 01:28:21,051
And one must have money to get
pretty things.

1144
01:28:22,594 --> 01:28:25,472
I was very fond of you, Judith.

1145
01:28:25,514 --> 01:28:27,850
Once.

1146
01:28:27,891 --> 01:28:30,853
But even you're losing your looks now.

1147
01:28:32,354 --> 01:28:36,358
It is an awfuI shame, do you
not think, Monsieur?

1148
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:41,280
That we must all wither and die?

1149
01:28:43,824 --> 01:28:46,243
Get them out of here.

1150
01:28:47,119 --> 01:28:49,496
No!

1151
01:28:59,965 --> 01:29:02,968
Thank you, Hercule.

1152
01:29:19,902 --> 01:29:22,487
Sir!

1153
01:29:36,251 --> 01:29:37,419
It's incredible.

1154
01:29:37,419 --> 01:29:41,882
Non. As soon as Madame Oliver told
to me of the dropping of the vase,

1155
01:29:41,924 --> 01:29:44,635
my suspicions they were aroused.

1156
01:29:44,635 --> 01:29:48,597
Because I knew that the killer of Joyce
Reynolds would have been soaking wet.

1157
01:29:48,597 --> 01:29:50,432
DreadfuI woman. I always said so.

1158
01:29:50,432 --> 01:29:53,894
Trying to bully me into giving that lecture.

1159
01:29:54,478 --> 01:29:57,397
And what about me and MichaeI?

1160
01:29:57,731 --> 01:30:00,234
How did you know?

1161
01:30:00,234 --> 01:30:05,447
Ah. Your histoire, madame,
it did not fooI Poirot.

1162
01:30:06,949 --> 01:30:08,450
Your husband who is dead?

1163
01:30:08,450 --> 01:30:12,663
Non, your husband was a figure of fantasy,

1164
01:30:12,704 --> 01:30:17,334
a figure tragique, a figure to conceaI
your long ago affair of the heart.

1165
01:30:17,376 --> 01:30:21,922
This husband, this pilot,
this Max, so beloved

1166
01:30:23,298 --> 01:30:27,177
and yet there was not one single
photograph of him on your mantelshelf.

1167
01:30:28,846 --> 01:30:31,431
I wanted to give Miranda some
notion of stability:

1168
01:30:31,431 --> 01:30:35,894
a father figure who was loving
and selfIess. Dependable.

1169
01:30:35,936 --> 01:30:39,022
Everything MichaeI wasn't capable of.

1170
01:30:39,022 --> 01:30:42,901
I hadn't seen him for years, you see. Then,
that day, he turned up in Woodleigh Common.

1171
01:30:43,277 --> 01:30:47,239
I tried to stay out of his way. I expected
he'd soon be gone. But he stayed.

1172
01:30:48,574 --> 01:30:53,370
I had no idea he and Miranda had become
so close. His influence over her.

1173
01:30:53,412 --> 01:30:57,165
There was a bond. A bond that was naturaI.

1174
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:01,003
But even this was not sufficient
to prevent him from attempting

1175
01:31:01,003 --> 01:31:05,007
to kill his own daughter and save himself.

1176
01:31:05,632 --> 01:31:08,802
- You had a lucky escape, Jude.
- Oui.

1177
01:31:08,802 --> 01:31:12,472
- What now? Will you stay here?
- I don't think so.

1178
01:31:13,098 --> 01:31:15,601
Hard to believe it all happened.

1179
01:31:15,601 --> 01:31:18,395
All those grisly deaths.

1180
01:31:18,395 --> 01:31:19,813
It's like a nightmare.

1181
01:31:19,813 --> 01:31:23,275
Or a tale of terror.

1182
01:31:23,567 --> 01:31:26,111
Poirot he was right.

1183
01:31:26,111 --> 01:31:29,031
Hallowe'en is not the time for
the telling of the stories macabre

1184
01:31:29,031 --> 01:31:32,659
but to light the candles for the dead.

1185
01:31:32,659 --> 01:31:36,580
Come, mes amis. Let us do so.
