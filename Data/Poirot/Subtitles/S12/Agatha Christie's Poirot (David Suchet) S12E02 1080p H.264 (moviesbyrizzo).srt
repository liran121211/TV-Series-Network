1
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:07,107
Ready about!

2
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,568
Go about!

3
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:32,716
What's that one?

4
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:37,012
Oh, it's called an anchor bend,
surprisingly.

5
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,855
Hello.
Manage to find your way around?

6
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:10,939
<i>Oui.</i>

7
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:13,233
-Ahoy there!
-Charlie!

8
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,903
Poirot, you've arrived.

9
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:18,655
<i>Merci.</i>

10
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,242
My guess is you're in the
entertainment business, too?

11
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:25,162
<i>Non, non. Non, monsieur,
I am a spectator merely.</i>

12
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,789
Been down here before?

13
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:31,126
No. No, I was introduced to
Sir Charles at a bridge party.

14
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,545
Oh, it is now many years.

15
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,965
And you, monsieur, you have
known him for a long time also?

16
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,301
Ah, yes.
We were at Oxford together.

17
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:41,511
Tell me, why do you think
he has retired?

18
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,472
<i>Well, cherchez la femme,
old fruit.</i>

19
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:44,556
That's all I'll say.

20
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:46,600
Tollie, welcome.
Good to see you.

21
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,645
-Poirot.
-My dear Charles.

22
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,399
I'm so glad you two
have finally met --

23
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:57,361
my two best friends
in all the world.

24
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,072
Good afternoon, Sir Charles.

25
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:01,448
Gentlemen.

26
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,116
Here is the menu for dinner.

27
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,620
Before sailing,
it was racing cars, remember?

28
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,038
<i>Oui, d'accord.</i>

29
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:10,582
What next?
Hot-air balloons?

30
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,793
If you will excuse me,
Sir Charles,

31
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,921
it might be a good idea
were I to dine with you tonight.

32
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,339
Well, that would be lovely.

33
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:18,924
Otherwise, we shall have

34
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,510
an odd number of males
and females at table.

35
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,011
I'm glad you agree.

36
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:24,388
Gentlemen.

37
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,849
Remarkable specimen.
How long have you had her?

38
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,977
Six years.
First in London, then here.

39
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,603
Runs the place like clockwork.

40
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,981
But now the bloody woman
wants to leave.

41
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,358
She's leaving?
Why?

42
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,777
She says she has
an invalid mother.

43
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,362
Sounds unlikely to me.

44
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:41,863
I'd be very surprised

45
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,574
if Miss Milray had
biological parents at all.

46
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,674
<i>Je te remercie
for your invitation.</i>

47
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,467
This is a spot most beautiful.

48
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:07,597
So, tell to me, if you please,
who are to be the other guests?

49
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:11,018
Yes, come on, Charlie. Who are
the figures in this drama?

50
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,270
The dramatis personae?
Very well.

51
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,607
Down from London
are Captain and Mrs. Dacres.

52
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,321
Cynthia is, in fact,
Ambrosine of Bond Street.

53
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,909
Not the dressmaker
that is so celebrated?

54
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,786
That's it.

55
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,205
Whilst Dacres,
once a jockey himself,

56
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:37,002
is now something
of a flat-racing fanatic.

57
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,547
Who else?

58
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,174
Also from London

59
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,927
is the up-and-coming playwright
Anthony Astor.

60
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,138
Oh, splendid.

61
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:52,059
Does this London lot know
the others who are coming?

62
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,977
No. Why should they?

63
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,646
My ingenue tonight
will be Miss Lytton Gore.

64
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,484
Egg Lytton Gore?

65
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:03,862
Accompanied by her mother,

66
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:04,946
Lady Mary.

67
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,531
The genuine article.

68
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:09,493
Long on breeding, short on cash.

69
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,287
Then there are the Babbingtons.

70
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:16,500
Nothing very notable there,
but protocol demands, et cetera.

71
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,293
Best to have the parson along.

72
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,006
Then, last
and in every way least,

73
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,512
the young squib Oliver Manders.

74
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,722
The villain of the piece?

75
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:34,351
Let's just say
he's a little bit devious.

76
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,729
Accompanied by the chip
on his shoulder.

77
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,190
Never goes anywhere without it.

78
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:41,566
And that is my cast.

79
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,821
Ah, but we must not forget
Mlle. Milray,

80
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,572
for she is also to join us.

81
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,991
How could one forget
Miss Milray?

82
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,160
The specter at the feast.

83
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,420
This is Captain Dacres

84
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:05,966
and the very beautiful
Cynthia Dacres.

85
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:08,844
For many years, madame,

86
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,430
I have admired
your creations formidable.

87
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,140
How penetrating of you.

88
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,933
Any chance of a drink, old boy?

89
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:17,602
I'm just about to mix
some cocktails.

90
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,896
As soon as the others arrive.

91
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,066
Any tips for Goodwood, Dacres?

92
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,068
You're a man of the turf,
I hear.

93
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,029
What else do you know?

94
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,282
I beg your pardon?

95
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,242
What else has she told you?

96
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:33,285
Who, man?

97
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,579
Her.

98
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:43,295
Well, I'm not ashamed
of my profession.

99
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:44,880
Not one bit.

100
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:47,340
There may well be miners
and stevedores and so forth

101
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,342
whose budget does not stretch
to couture,

102
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,679
but if any woman is misguided
enough to marry one of them,

103
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:57,058
that, as they say,
is her lookout.

104
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,772
Mademoiselle, who is that lady?

105
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:06,109
Oh, that's
Anthony Astor, the playwright.

106
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:10,155
Her real name is Muriel Wills.

107
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,700
Oh, here come the locals.

108
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,161
Oh.
You're here.

109
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:19,039
Good evening.

110
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:20,790
Vicar.

111
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,000
Come in, come in.

112
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:23,251
Drinks.

113
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,669
Aye, aye, Skipper.

114
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,047
This is Mlle. Lytton Gore

115
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,966
who calls herself
something amusante?

116
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:31,051
Egg.

117
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,427
Don't ask me why.

118
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,096
Boiled, I like to think.

119
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,557
Have a cocktail, Egg.

120
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,268
Cheers.

121
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,562
Thank you.

122
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:49,277
I say, Sir Charles, you do know
some very reactionary people.

123
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,862
People are people.

124
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,405
I'm not political.

125
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,699
Oliver's not political either.

126
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:57,244
He just went to the East End
once, by mistake,

127
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,454
and had
a "Road to Damascus" moment.

128
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,331
You of all people, Egg, should
know how degrading poverty is.

129
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:02,707
Oh, I say, steady on.

130
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,293
It's all right.
I can fend for myself.

131
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:14,928
-Madam?
-Oh, do I dare?

132
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:16,972
Go on, Mums.

133
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,933
Show Mr. Manders we're not
completely ground down

134
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,726
by the iron heel of capitalism.

135
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:24,604
I think I might have one, too,
if my wife permits.

136
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,816
May I have my annual drink,
dear?

137
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,819
He'll do exactly as he likes,
as usual.

138
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,447
Do come and meet
a friend of mine

139
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,241
who is actually a detective.

140
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,284
A real one?

141
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,785
-A real one.
-Golly.

142
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:39,911
This tastes slightly...

143
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:43,248
It's a cocktail, Stephen,
not a pint of mild.

144
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,209
Mr. Babbington!

145
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,420
What's happened?
Is he ill?

146
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:49,921
Out of the way.

147
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,300
-Stephen, what is it?
-Is he all right, Tollie?

148
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,885
Talk to me. Stephen.

149
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,266
No, I'm sorry, he's not.

150
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,436
He's dead.

151
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:05,520
What?

152
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:06,563
Oh, my God!

153
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:07,897
Stephen!

154
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,941
Stephen, please!

155
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:18,742
Did you ever see anyone die
like that, Tollie?

156
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:20,910
I'm a psychologist.

157
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,996
I don't see people die much
at all.

158
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:26,875
A nerve specialist tries rather
hard to keep his patients alive.

159
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:30,003
Something is out of joint.
I can't put my finger on it.

160
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,756
What if he was murdered?

161
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,341
Murdered?

162
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,926
Who'd want to murder
a harmless old clergyman?

163
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,386
What if he wasn't harmless?

164
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:40,889
Look, Charlie,
you're a thundering good chap,

165
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:44,100
but you do let your imagination
run away with you sometimes.

166
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:46,102
Poirot, you're a crime expert.

167
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:49,481
Do you think anything untoward
happened here tonight?

168
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:52,776
We're planning to get
that glass -- his glass --

169
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:54,486
chemically analyzed.

170
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:55,987
Ah, oui?
It can do no harm.

171
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:58,990
Yes, and what do
you think will be the result?

172
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,368
All I can do is to guess,
Sir Bartholomew.

173
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,162
And my guess, it is
that they will find the remains

174
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:05,914
of a dry martini most excellent.

175
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,956
To poison a man with a cocktail,

176
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,375
one of many handed
around on a tray --

177
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,418
<i>it is a technique
très difficile.</i>

178
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,462
So, what do you think happened?

179
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:14,172
All I know, Sir Bartholomew,

180
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:16,508
is that he was taken ill
most suddenly.

181
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:20,720
Mes amis, perhaps the inquest,
it will reveal to us, hein?

182
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,723
I find nothing to indicate
foul play of any kind.

183
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,976
No trace of poison in his glass,
no sign of any wounding.

184
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,605
I conclude that the decease of
the Reverend Stephen Babbington

185
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:33,149
was occasioned solely
by natural causes.

186
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,777
Natural causes?

187
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,195
What a lot of tripe.

188
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,197
That coroner should be
struck off at once.

189
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,366
But the vicar
is elderly, mademoiselle,

190
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,034
and his health,
it is not so good.

191
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,537
Oh, he had a touch of arthritis,
nothing more.

192
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,622
He should have lived
till he was 90.

193
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,999
Did you know him well,
this M. Babbington?

194
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,376
Yes.

195
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,920
He was a sweet man,
a devout Christian,

196
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,964
and never unkind to anybody.

197
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,882
They had a son, you know,
Robin.

198
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:00,760
Actually, I used to have
rather a pash for Robin.

199
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,137
And Robin is?

200
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:04,139
He's, well, in India.

201
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,226
So, you see, I feel
rather strongly about this.

202
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,855
Supposing it wasn't
natural causes...

203
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,941
Ma chère, there was nothing
in that cocktail glass

204
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,192
but vermouth and gin.

205
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,235
It is proved.

206
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:19,612
Oh, yes, yes,
but it's still damned odd.

207
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,782
I mean, the Babbingtons hadn't
an enemy in the world.

208
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,535
And yet why would he just
keel over and die?

209
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,537
I'm going to find Sir Charles

210
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,373
and give him
a piece of my mind.

211
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,543
I suppose he's had loads
of affairs, has he?

212
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,211
<i>Mademoiselle,
je suis désolé,</i>

213
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:36,212
but it is not for --

214
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:37,255
It's all right.

215
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,132
I like a man
to have had affairs.

216
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,884
Shows he's properly red-blooded.

217
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,260
Unlike him.

218
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,680
But I thought the two
of you, you were friends?

219
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:49,142
Yes, he's gone into
his uncle's office in the city,

220
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,562
and, well, he's getting a bit
oily, if you know what I mean.

221
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,273
He just wants to get rich,
which I find odd,

222
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,567
as he's always saying
he's a Communist.

223
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:00,445
But, then, I find most people
rather disgusting

224
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:02,322
when it comes to money.

225
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,200
Mademoiselle,
so many people are disgusting

226
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,286
about so many things.

227
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,682
I'm going to say good night,
Poirot.

228
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,227
I've got an early morning train
to catch.

229
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:34,771
<i>Will you return to London,
M. le Docteur?</i>

230
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:37,148
No.
I'm going to Yorkshire.

231
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,943
I have a private clinic
up there.

232
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,363
I hope we meet
under better circs next time.

233
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,656
<i>Oui d'accord.</i>

234
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:45,698
Charlie.

235
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,243
When you two leave,
I shall be quite alone.

236
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,038
I'm sure you'll find
some attractive company.

237
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,998
No, I'm an old man, Tollie.

238
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:56,835
Hair grows out of my ears.

239
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,004
Fifteen years ago, perhaps,

240
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,924
but now I think
I'm deluding myself.

241
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:07,887
Damned nice though she is.

242
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,975
I'm thinking of selling up,
actually.

243
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:13,935
Ah, oui?

244
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:17,438
Well, then we may resume
our weekly lunches at the Ritz?

245
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,148
No, I mean to get away.

246
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,650
To where?

247
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,819
I thought the Riviera.

248
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,280
Monte Carlo.

249
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,783
I made a visit to Monte Carlo
each year.

250
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,743
Oh, yes, of course you do.

251
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,871
Where do you stay?
At the Majestic, isn't it?

252
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,372
<i>Naturellement.</i>

253
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:35,790
Excellent.

254
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:40,211
I need something to take my mind
off this awful murder.

255
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:45,174
But, then, you don't think
it is murder, do you, Poirot?

256
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,385
<i>I do not wish to disappoint you,
mon ami,</i>

257
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:49,178
but I do not see
how it could be.

258
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,597
No.
Well, anyway,

259
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:55,935
I don't mean to stay in Cornwall
a moment longer.

260
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:18,917
I wish to God I'd never come
to the wretched place.

261
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:28,384
Goodness, there must
be some money in psychology.

262
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,762
Yes, Mums,
but why has he invited us here?

263
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,055
We barely know the man.

264
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,182
It takes me back
to my younger days.

265
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:37,143
The shooting parties, the balls.

266
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,062
Of course not, you idiot.

267
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:41,481
We received an invitation,
that's all.

268
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,399
I'm warning you, Cynthia.

269
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:46,402
First sign of a white coat,
I'm making a dash for it.

270
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,323
Welcome! Welcome!

271
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,866
Do come through.

272
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,703
Thank you so much
for inviting us.

273
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,747
Evening.
Straight through.

274
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,156
That was a very
fine meal, Sir Bartholomew.

275
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,784
One found the meringue
especially captivating.

276
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,453
And you don't stint
on the firewater as well,

277
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,414
I'm pleased to say.

278
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,461
Shall we clear now, sir?

279
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,548
By Jove, yes, do.

280
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,393
Serve the cheese now, Ellis,
would you?

281
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:12,822
Oliver!

282
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:14,949
My God, Manders.
What happened?

283
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:16,909
A bad smash, I'm afraid.

284
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,579
I've been up in Cumberland
for the shooting.

285
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:20,830
I was on my way back to London

286
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:22,331
when I lost control
of my machine.

287
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,126
Bit of luck I was right outside
your house, Sir Bartholomew.

288
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:26,294
I'll say.

289
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,337
Shall I pour the port, sir?

290
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:30,173
Yes, thank you.

291
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,799
Is this where
your sanatorium is?

292
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,176
Yes. In the grounds.

293
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,969
Oh, tucked away?

294
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,513
What caused the crash?

295
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,766
I think I hit an oil slick.

296
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,225
Plowed into your wall.

297
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:44,020
Sorry about the medieval masonry
and all that.

298
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:47,440
That is an extremely
tall tale, Mr. Manders.

299
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:52,278
However, we drink
to your miraculous escape.

300
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,448
As a matter of fact,

301
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:59,077
I am very fortunate to have you
amongst the company,

302
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,747
amongst my good friends
from Cornwall and London,

303
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:06,584
for the reason that I have
something remarkable to reveal.

304
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,462
I'm only sorry Charlie
Cartwright can't be here.

305
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:10,838
He'd relish it.

306
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,256
Why can't he?

307
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:14,258
He's in the South of France.

308
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:15,927
What a pity.

309
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,887
Now, ladies and gentlemen,

310
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:20,556
it has recently been brought
to my attention

311
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,642
that one of you...

312
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:33,152
Help! Somebody get some help!

313
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,570
Quickly!

314
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,750
<i>En bord! En bord!
Le train bleu!</i>

315
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:52,088
<i>Gare de Lyon
pour Monte Carlo.</i>

316
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,585
"Be cheerful, sir.
Our revels now are ended."

317
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:32,712
<i>-Jouez avec moi.
-Non.</i>

318
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,006
<i>Jouez avec moi, monsieur.</i>

319
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:38,509
<i>Amuse-toi avec ton ballon.
Non, non, madame.</i>

320
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,264
Poirot.

321
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,683
<i>Ah, Sir Charles.
Quelle surprise.</i>

322
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:49,020
Thank heavens
I've found you. Look at this.

323
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:50,563
<i>Oh, non, non.</i>

324
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:51,939
Oh, yes.

325
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:54,442
"We regret to announce the death

326
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,444
of Sir Bartholomew Strange,

327
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,404
the eminent nerve specialist.

328
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,782
His demise occurred suddenly
at the end of a dinner party.

329
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,659
He was drinking a glass of port

330
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,953
when he had a sudden seizure
and died

331
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,997
before medical aid
could be summoned."

332
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,624
A glass of port?

333
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:12,460
Now will you take me seriously?

334
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:14,378
<i>Oui.</i>

335
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:18,883
<i>We must return to England
tout de suite.</i>

336
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,511
Dear Sir Charles,
I'm so worried.

337
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:26,265
You'll have seen in the papers
that Sir Bartholomew is dead.

338
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,685
Well, he died in just the same
way as poor Mr. Babbington.

339
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,855
Also, I'm worried
about someone else.

340
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,690
My friend Oliver.

341
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,360
He's acting rather strangely.

342
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,987
I can't explain it all
in a letter.

343
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:42,323
But you could find out
the truth.

344
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:43,824
I know you could.

345
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:47,662
Do come back. Egg.

346
00:20:57,464 --> 00:21:00,591
May I say what a pleasure it is
to see you again, Sir Charles?

347
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:01,801
Oh, thank you, George.

348
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,928
I hope you have enjoyed
your time in France.

349
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,513
Splendid. Thank you.

350
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,056
<i>Merci, George.</i>

351
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:10,017
Now, let us see
who else was present

352
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,520
<i>at the death of Dr. Strange,
hein?</i>

353
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,397
<i>Ah, ici.</i>

354
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,484
Sir Bartholomew Strange
is having his usual party

355
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,860
for the St. Leger.

356
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,530
Among the guests
are Lord and Lady Cardigan,

357
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,323
Lady Mary Lytton Gore,

358
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,867
Captain and Mrs. Dacres,

359
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,578
and, ah, Miss M. Wills.

360
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:32,707
"Seduction after Dark."

361
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,625
I beg your pardon?

362
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:37,086
That was the play
written by Mlle. Wills.

363
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:40,631
Oui, but there is no mention
of M. Oliver Manders

364
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,675
and it was Mlle. Egg herself

365
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,094
who suggested
that he also was there.

366
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,305
Tell to me about Melfort Abbey.

367
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:51,309
Well, Tollie bought it
a few years back for a song,

368
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:55,187
restored it, and put up
a sanatorium, nursing home,

369
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:57,189
whatever you want to call it.

370
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,608
Nuthouse, basically.

371
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,698
I've got to find out
what happened.

372
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:10,536
Someone has murdered my friend.

373
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,913
I'd better get off to Yorkshire.

374
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,375
I know the chief constable
quite well.

375
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,169
One moment, my friend.

376
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:22,548
In Cornwall, I felt you to be
guilty of overstating the case

377
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,343
because I just found it
incredible

378
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,470
that such a gentleman
who was old and harmless

379
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,639
should die a death
anything that was but natural.

380
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:35,436
But now we have another death,
in circumstances very similar.

381
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:38,022
And Hercule Poirot,
he must admit an error,

382
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,483
and so, if you permit,

383
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:45,154
I, myself, Hercule Poirot,
will make the investigation.

384
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:48,657
Hercule Poirot
will travel to Yorkshire.

385
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:51,452
That's very handsome of you.
Won't it take up your time?

386
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:54,538
What is time
in the face of death?

387
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,391
I see you have changed
your shoes.

388
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,852
Yes.
I always start with the feet.

389
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:18,771
<i>Comment?</i>

390
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,898
With the shoes.
Get the walk right.

391
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:23,692
Then the costume.

392
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:26,904
Before you know it,
you've got a character.

393
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,409
<i>Ah, oui, d'accord, d'accord.</i>

394
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,428
Welcome to Yorkshire, gents.

395
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,139
Sorry about the weather,
but some of us like it.

396
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,057
I was expecting Fred Johnson.

397
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:58,102
The chief constable's away.

398
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:00,396
I'm stood in.

399
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,022
Name's Crossfield.

400
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,275
I may as well say right off,

401
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:07,361
I don't hold with amateurs
coming up from London

402
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,321
and telling me my business.

403
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,490
Superintendent, if you permit,

404
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:15,035
we are here because of the death
of Bartholomew Strange.

405
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,580
Dr. Strange?

406
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,041
He were highly spoke of
round here.

407
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:25,171
But I'm afraid to say
it looks like he were murdered.

408
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,881
There's nowt
to indicate suicide.

409
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,382
Tollie would never kill himself.

410
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:30,050
A friend of yours, sir?

411
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:31,218
Very much so, yes.

412
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:34,930
You look oddly familiar.

413
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,976
Anyway, there's nowt for you
to do here.

414
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:41,812
We're pretty sure
that the butler's our man.

415
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:44,982
New chap.

416
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:48,611
Strange had only had him
for a fortnight.

417
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,654
The morning after the crime,
he disappears,

418
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,780
vanishes into thin air.

419
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,449
Where did he come from?
Any idea?

420
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,034
Oh, yes, his name is Ellis.

421
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,205
Gave a London agency

422
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:02,500
and a reference
from a previous employer,

423
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,710
Sir Horace Bird,
Holland Park.

424
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:07,087
And have you spoken
with Sir Horace?

425
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:08,214
I'd be happy to,

426
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,508
only he's away in East Africa
on safari.

427
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,176
So, these references,
they could be --

428
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:14,345
Well, they're forged,
obviously, Poirot.

429
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:15,638
Anybody can see that.

430
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:18,349
And the houseguests?

431
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:20,017
They are to be called
as witnesses?

432
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:21,727
We have asked them to stay on,
yes.

433
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,020
Can we have a look
around Melfort Abbey?

434
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:24,063
No, you can't.

435
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,732
Now, look, I'm very pally
with Fred Johnson.

436
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:30,528
We used to play polo together
in India.

437
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:33,197
Hang about.

438
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,950
Aren't you
Sir Charles Cartwright?

439
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,326
At your service.

440
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,994
Well, why the heck
didn't you say so?

441
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:40,871
Eh.

442
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:47,002
I saw you in "Lord Aintree's
Dilemma." I did, yeah.

443
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:50,464
I took the wife to London,
and she wouldn't see owt else.

444
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,884
It had to be Charles Cartwright
in "Lord Aintree's Dilemma."

445
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,553
And I remember
we queued for hours

446
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:56,762
for the Pall Mall Theatre.

447
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,138
But it were worth it.

448
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,683
Superintendent, if you please.

449
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,936
Are you absolutely convinced
in your little gray cells

450
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,729
that this M. Ellis is your man?

451
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,147
Why else did he bolt?

452
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:14,572
My dear Charles, do you realize
that almost every person

453
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:17,283
who was present at your dinner
in Cornwall

454
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:19,201
was also present here?

455
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:22,162
Please don't assume
that because I'm a thespian,

456
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:23,414
I'm also dim.

457
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,832
Of course I realize.

458
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:27,543
What can we deduce from it?

459
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,545
No, it's just that
it appears to me

460
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,964
that the doctor,
he was making an experiment.

461
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,842
He must have thought that
one of the people in Cornwall

462
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,427
was responsible for the crime,

463
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:39,305
and so he has invited them here
to Melfort Abbey.

464
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:41,849
I wore this
as Galbraith of the Yard.

465
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:44,852
Rather authentic,
don't you think?

466
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:04,079
Hello, Annie.

467
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:05,456
Good morning,
Sir Charles. Come in.

468
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:06,832
<i>Merci.</i>

469
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,250
You've no butler?

470
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:10,002
Mr. Baker.
He's in Margate.

471
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:12,504
Sir Bartholomew gave him
two months' holiday,

472
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:13,547
for long service.

473
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,467
Excuse me, sir.

474
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:19,803
That's why Ellis was here.

475
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:23,182
It's a caller for you,
Sir Charles.

476
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,850
Oh, thank you, Annie.

477
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,394
Mademoiselle.

478
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:29,480
Crossfield here.

479
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:32,858
Now, listen, I've a pal who
works at the coroner's office,

480
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:35,277
and he's slipped me
the mortuary report.

481
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:37,404
They think it were
nicotine poisoning.

482
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,948
But couldn't you get that
just from smoking?

483
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,827
You'd have to smoke
a heck of a lot.

484
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:48,165
The nicotine is an
alkaloid, colorless, odorless,

485
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,251
and is used habitually
by the gardeners

486
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:53,420
for the spraying of the roses.

487
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:54,463
Ah.

488
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:57,341
Also, they got a toxicology
report on the glass.

489
00:27:57,717 --> 00:27:59,593
It contained port
and only port.

490
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:01,637
Exactly the same as last time.

491
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:04,390
With one difference
most important, mon ami.

492
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,227
This time,
we know it was murder.

493
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:12,356
So, how did you find it
serving under M. Ellis?

494
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:15,734
Oh, it were quite fun,
actually, sir.

495
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:19,321
Yeah.
He'd been in service all over.

496
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,990
He knew things, scandals.

497
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:24,368
About some very grand
households, too.

498
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:27,579
Is it possible that he was not,
in fact, a butler?

499
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,582
Oh, no, sir.

500
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,168
No, he'd been in service
for sure.

501
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,963
Well, he arranged
the work different

502
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:38,590
from any butler
I ever knew before.

503
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:42,302
Got his own method
sort of thing.

504
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:46,473
So, tell to me, if you please,
about the Dr. Strange.

505
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:49,101
On the night that he died,
how was his mood?

506
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,687
Oh, he were happy, sir.
Very jolly.

507
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,151
He even larked about
with Mr. Ellis,

508
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:00,112
a thing I'd never heard him do
with Mr. Baker.

509
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:03,115
Pardon, but what does it mean
"he larked about"?

510
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:06,285
Mr. Ellis came up
with a telephone message,

511
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,913
and the doctor asked him if
he was sure he'd got it right.

512
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,957
And Mr. Ellis said,
"Quite sure,"

513
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:14,001
and the doctor laughed and said,

514
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,629
"You're an excellent butler,
Ellis."

515
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,590
I were that surprised.

516
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:22,634
What was this telephone message?

517
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:28,348
Oh, it were from the sanatorium,
about a patient who'd arrived.

518
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:30,559
A Mrs. Rushbridger.

519
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,311
Or something like that.

520
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:37,274
That'll be them coming back
from the inquest.

521
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,425
Miss Wills, do you mind

522
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:05,260
if we ask you some questions?

523
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,929
Do you mind
if I call my solicitor?

524
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,305
Um, do we, Poirot?

525
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,557
Je pense que Mlle. Wills,

526
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,601
<i>she makes a little joke,
non?</i>

527
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:14,645
What is it you want to ask?

528
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,815
Did you notice anything unusual

529
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,402
about the arrangements
that night?

530
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:24,905
I heard there was
a secret tunnel.

531
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:25,948
Did you hear about that?

532
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:26,782
No!

533
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,158
Yes.

534
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:31,703
There's a secret tunnel
that leads to open countryside.

535
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,288
-Is there?
-Yes.

536
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:36,458
And they think the butler
crawled along it and escaped.

537
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:37,835
Crikey.

538
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:39,419
Where is it?

539
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:42,881
Ah, well, that's the sort of
thing that detectives detect,

540
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,424
isn't it?

541
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:47,219
I'd start with the bookshelves
if I were you.

542
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:50,138
Miss Wills?

543
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,015
I couldn't say what Miss Wills
thought about anything.

544
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:54,393
Eh bien, will you tell to us
what you thought about her?

545
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,186
Someone said she lives
in Tooting,

546
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:57,729
which she can't help, I suppose,

547
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,398
but she does poke and pry
something terrible.

548
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:00,440
She was in my room.

549
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:01,650
-She was what?
-In my room.

550
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:02,693
Poking about.

551
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,695
No, she wasn't.
You're seeing things.

552
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:05,737
Oh, here we go again.

553
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,364
The funny farm's
round the corner.

554
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,824
Do be quiet, Derek.

555
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,784
There's supposed to be
a secret tunnel.

556
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,452
Have you heard about that?

557
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,913
The coroner said
it was nicotine poisoning.

558
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:15,956
What's that?

559
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:17,124
Well, Egg,

560
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,626
it's a colorless,
odorless alkaloid,

561
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:22,754
widely available, in fact.

562
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,757
Often used by gardeners
to spray their roses with.

563
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,509
I use it.
Everyone does.

564
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:31,096
If you please to tell me,
mademoiselle,

565
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,681
where is Oliver Manders now?

566
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:35,726
Oh, he went straight back
to town after the inquest.

567
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,270
He had to get straight
back to work, poor love.

568
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,188
Did Ellis poison Dr. Strange?

569
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:44,067
Well, how am I supposed
to know that?

570
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,945
Do you have any information

571
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,196
about the secret passage?

572
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,324
-Do you?!
-I certainly don't.

573
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,618
And I don't think
Mums does either.

574
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,287
Oh, God, this is hopeless.

575
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:57,581
We haven't found out
a single thing.

576
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:59,833
But you're doing
wonderfully well.

577
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:48,590
The police have already searched
Mr. Ellis' room, sir.

578
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:50,050
Yes, thanks, Annie.

579
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:53,261
<i>Merci, mademoiselle.</i>

580
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:58,475
Well, what have we here?

581
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:08,485
Ah!

582
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,490
He had athlete's foot.

583
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:20,789
Oh, look.

584
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,749
What is that?

585
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,876
It's ink.

586
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:30,048
There is something that is
discomposing in my mind.

587
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:31,883
Yes? Go on.

588
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,387
It is simply the way
that Sir Bartholomew Strange,

589
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,180
he made a joke with his butler,

590
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,141
as was told to us
by Mlle. Annie.

591
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:42,060
It did not seem in keeping
with his character.

592
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,562
By God, you're right.

593
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,315
Tollie would never have spoken
to the staff like that.

594
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:48,692
<i>Alors?</i>

595
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:50,861
And when did the incident occur?

596
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:55,198
When Ellis brought the telephone
message from the sanatorium.

597
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:59,494
I'll bet there's no such person
as Mrs. Rushbridger.

598
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:03,540
I'll bet you
it's a coded message.

599
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:12,841
I've just returned from abroad
to this dreadful news.

600
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:14,593
I wanted to call in

601
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,304
and make sure that everything
was shipshape.

602
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:20,223
Dr. Strange was very proud
of this place, Matron.

603
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,142
Thank you.

604
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:25,896
His experimental treatments
are often a great success.

605
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,105
Well, yes,

606
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,899
I was speaking to a chap
in Monte Carlo

607
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:30,776
who has a relation coming here.

608
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:32,986
Missus...
Damn, what was the name?

609
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,155
Bridger?
Rushbridge?

610
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,866
-Mrs. de Rushbridger?
-Yes.

611
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:39,868
Oh, yes, she arrived.

612
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:41,828
Rather a bad breakdown.

613
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:44,706
Lapses of memory,
severe nervous exhaustion.

614
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,752
She won't be seeing anyone
for a very long time.

615
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,337
Oh, dear.

616
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:52,005
Thank you so much, Matron.

617
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,008
<i>Merci.</i>

618
00:34:58,930 --> 00:34:59,846
Damn. Damn.

619
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:01,556
The bloody woman exists.

620
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:04,101
This whole thing's giving me
a headache.

621
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:07,604
What do you say we go somewhere
for a stiff whiskey?

622
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,314
<i>Non, non, non, mon cher.</i>

623
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:12,234
We must return
to the bedroom of Ellis.

624
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:16,279
Ellis?
Why?

625
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,740
The stain of ink?

626
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,867
Now you remember perhaps?

627
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:24,246
Yes, it's just a stain
on the skirting board, Poirot.

628
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,164
But how does it come
to be there?

629
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,917
No, something, it is amiss.

630
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:31,545
Yes, by God, you're right.

631
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:35,340
He didn't drop his ink bottle.
There'd be more ink.

632
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:37,175
He dropped his fountain pen.

633
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,219
And he must have been writing
at the time

634
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:41,054
or the top wouldn't
have been off.

635
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:45,058
Perhaps he laid it on
the mantelshelf and it rolled?

636
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:51,481
<i>Non.</i>

637
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:55,527
You know, in the theater,

638
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:58,989
we have to examine the internal
logic of all our actions.

639
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:03,160
There's this Russian cove
called Stanislavsky who...

640
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:08,540
He's writing a letter.

641
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:11,334
He thinks he hears something.

642
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,212
He has to hide the letter.

643
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:17,340
No time to rip up a floorboard.

644
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:18,508
<i>Non.</i>

645
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,844
He can't burn it.

646
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:23,430
<i>Non.
Because of the cinders.</i>

647
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:25,807
<i>Là, là, là!</i>

648
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:29,561
Only one place.

649
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:33,440
Behind the fire?
Have a look, mon ami.

650
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:40,363
<i>Non?</i>

651
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:45,076
<i>Oui?</i>

652
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:46,786
Bravo!

653
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:48,705
Excellent!

654
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:55,503
We believe they are letters
drafted by the fugitive Ellis.

655
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:59,049
"This is to say that the writer

656
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:02,761
does not wish to cause
unpleasantness, but..."

657
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:06,598
"John Ellis, butler,
presents his compliments

658
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,850
and would be glad
of a short interview

659
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,644
touching the tragedy tonight,

660
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:13,772
before going to the police
with certain information."

661
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,440
"I am badly in need of money.

662
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:18,568
£1,000 would make
all the difference to me.

663
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:20,528
Meet me at..."

664
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:24,449
So that's it.
Blackmail.

665
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:28,828
May I ask
who you're telephoning to?

666
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:31,081
Cornwall.
The Loomouth Police.

667
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:36,336
So, Ellis knew something

668
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:37,796
and he was paid to disappear

669
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,422
and that's exactly what he did.

670
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:42,717
The question is
"Where's he gone?"

671
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:46,221
My friend, I am convinced
that this M. Ellis,

672
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:50,267
he is dead.

673
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:52,852
That is why there...

674
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,440
That is why
there is no trace of him.

675
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:59,901
We are dealing with a maniac
that is very dangerous.

676
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:01,278
Oh, my Lord.

677
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:04,781
Well, what about Egg?
Is she going to be all right?

678
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:06,992
There is something
that concerns me

679
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,869
about the Mlle. Egg Lytton Gore.

680
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,080
The stain on the wall.

681
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:13,581
It's ink.

682
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,458
How did she know
that it was ink?

683
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:17,043
To me, it was simply a stain
on the wall.

684
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:19,838
Women have a better-developed
color sense than us, don't they?

685
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,840
But it makes me
to be suspicious.

686
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,174
Of Egg?

687
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,634
-Oui.
-Oh, no.

688
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,219
My dear friend, forgive me,

689
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:28,638
but we must consider
every eventuality.

690
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:30,765
Of course we must,
but it's not her.

691
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:34,769
It can't be. No, no, no, no, no.
No, can't be.

692
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,369
George.

693
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:56,041
I am so fatigued.

694
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:58,626
Sir, I'm afraid
there are visitors

695
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,130
in the drawing room.

696
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,674
Visitors in the drawing room?

697
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,717
Yes, sir.

698
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,719
But it is 11:00
at night, George.

699
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:08,762
Indeed it is, sir.

700
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:09,888
It is 11:00 at night,

701
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,473
therefore we do not have
visitors in the drawing room.

702
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:12,515
No, sir.

703
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:13,850
Take this.

704
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:15,352
Of course.

705
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:16,978
Mlle. Lytton Gore.

706
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:18,772
Oh, call me Egg,
for Pete's sake.

707
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,190
What is it that you do here?

708
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:21,900
-Good evening.
-M. Oliver.

709
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,443
Oliver has something
to tell you.

710
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:25,320
Tell him.

711
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,531
The motorcycle crash
was a stunt, sir.

712
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:29,783
I faked it.

713
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:30,909
<i>Comment?</i>

714
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,494
Why did you do such a thing?

715
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:35,163
And do not make me angry,
monsieur.

716
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:36,706
I am very fatigued.

717
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,375
I was told to do it.

718
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:39,542
By whom?

719
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:41,795
Bartholomew Strange.

720
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,296
He wrote to me
and told me to fake a crash

721
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:44,339
and arrive about half-past 9:00.

722
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:45,382
But when I got there,

723
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:46,758
he seemed as surprised
as everyone else.

724
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:48,051
And 10 minutes later,
he is poisoned?

725
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:49,636
-Yes.
-And there is no connection?

726
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,971
No.
I had nothing to do with it.

727
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,271
You have not told this
to the police?

728
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,441
Well, it's going to look
a bit windy, isn't it, sir?

729
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,698
Why did you obey
his instructions?

730
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,701
I heard you'd be there.

731
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:16,371
And I knew Charles Cartwright
was in France.

732
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:18,498
Oh, Ollie, why are you so wet?

733
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,583
-I'm nervous.
-Why? I don't bite.

734
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:22,085
I'm mindful of Robin Babbington.

735
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:23,128
Don't be ridiculous.

736
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,546
Excuse me, what has happened
to Robin Babbington?

737
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:25,713
Well, Robin fell in love
with her, too,

738
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,340
and she sent him to India.
He never came back.

739
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:28,633
-Why not?
-That's enough!

740
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,677
He went all mystical, went to
live in an ashram or something.

741
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,512
-Totally gaga.
-He did what he wanted!

742
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:33,847
Did he,
or did you drive him away?

743
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:36,182
You drive us all away
in the end, Egg!

744
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,455
Miserable business.

745
00:40:58,581 --> 00:40:59,497
I know.

746
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:00,874
But it must be done.

747
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:04,043
Stephen Babbington
was a gentle old soul

748
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,129
without an enemy in the world.

749
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:07,714
And yet he was killed.

750
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,717
Or at least
we think he was killed.

751
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:13,511
We're about to find out.

752
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:17,098
What reasons are there
for killing a person?

753
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:20,143
Babbington knew something.

754
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,353
Babbington recognized somebody.

755
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,730
What did he know?

756
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:27,984
Perhaps it was something
he didn't know he knew.

757
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:31,571
Perhaps he was the cause
and Dr. Strange the effect.

758
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:33,364
<i>Précisément.</i>

759
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:34,782
What?

760
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:37,535
If we are to believe
that the second murder,

761
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,829
it sprung directly
from the first,

762
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:43,041
then it is the first murder
that we must investigate.

763
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:46,794
The murder of the Reverend
Stephen Babbington.

764
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,424
If I hadn't moved to Cornwall,

765
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:54,969
none of this
would have happened.

766
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,014
I'm deluding myself, Egg.

767
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:01,809
I'm no detective.

768
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:16,634
Mlle. Wills,
what is it that you do here?

769
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:21,139
Well, I've never seen
an exhumation before.

770
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,349
Ah, so, this is all --
How do you say --

771
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:24,851
grist to your mill?

772
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:28,229
Your command of English
is really rather wonderful,

773
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:29,606
isn't it?

774
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,120
Poor Stephen.

775
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,539
He told Egg
to steer clear of Oliver.

776
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,500
But girls are very foolish,
M. Poirot.

777
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:53,796
There's something attractive
to a girl

778
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:56,633
about being told
that so-and-so is a bad man.

779
00:43:56,967 --> 00:44:01,638
She at once thinks
that her love will reform him.

780
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:07,185
It may seem a wicked thing
to say,

781
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,855
but I was relieved
when my husband died

782
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:12,899
and it was just Egg and I,

783
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,942
a little roly-poly baby,

784
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:19,072
trying to stand up,
always falling over.

785
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:22,450
Yes, it's a ridiculous nickname.

786
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,411
But don't let that deceive you.

787
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:28,164
She's a girl who knows
what she wants.

788
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:30,041
On the night
that Dr. Strange died,

789
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:32,168
did he appear to be worried
about anything?

790
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:33,378
No.

791
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,046
No.
He was in high spirits.

792
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:38,424
He seemed to be amused
about something,

793
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:41,010
some private joke.

794
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:44,013
He said he was going to spring
a surprise.

795
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:48,768
Sadly, he did.

796
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:57,527
Do you really think

797
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:59,862
someone murdered my husband
with nicotine?

798
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:02,240
That's what
they're trying to find out.

799
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:06,035
All we know is that Tollie
Strange drank some port,

800
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:07,328
and, well, it was...

801
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:08,705
It was just the same.

802
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,790
I was there.

803
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:13,042
It was just the same.

804
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:16,838
You have some lovely flowers,
Mrs. Babbington.

805
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:18,756
What are these?

806
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:20,633
Lupins, dear.

807
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:23,302
But I have such trouble
with greenfly,

808
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:25,930
I have to spray them
constantly.

809
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,475
Forgive my forthrightness,
Mrs. Babbington,

810
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,937
but did your husband leave you
very much money?

811
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:35,440
What?

812
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:37,233
He gave away everything.

813
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:40,069
Missionaries were better off
than we were.

814
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,822
I used to scold him about it.

815
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:46,284
What about when he was younger?

816
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,327
Did he have any enemies?

817
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:50,121
Enemies?
No.

818
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:54,041
Stephen was my father's curate.

819
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:56,753
We were engaged for four years,

820
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:59,255
then he got a living
in Kent, in Gilling,

821
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,674
so we were able to get married.

822
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:03,885
We lived in Gilling
for 16 years.

823
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:07,638
Then we came to Cornwall.

824
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:12,185
We were happy.

825
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:01,108
I have a little idea
I would like to suggest.

826
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,320
Is it possible that the poison

827
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:08,199
was intended all along
for Sir Bartholomew Strange,

828
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:10,451
and then
the Reverend Babbington,

829
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:12,411
he drank it by mistake?

830
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:14,539
No one who knew Tollie
at all well

831
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,833
would have tried to poison him
with a cocktail.

832
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:18,084
<i>Mais pourquoi pas?</i>

833
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:20,628
Because he never drank them.

834
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:21,921
Couldn't stand them.

835
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:23,840
Ah, oui?

836
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:29,470
May I speak to you the truth?

837
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:33,724
You know
this whole investigation,

838
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:38,604
it has been conducted with great
enthusiasm and great skill

839
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:42,817
but it has yielded very little.

840
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:46,988
And there is danger.

841
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:48,990
Real danger.

842
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,660
So, now, Poirot,
he will take charge.

843
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:55,246
We will return to London
by the early train.

844
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:58,332
And if you please, mademoiselle,

845
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:01,711
you will make the visit to the
showrooms of Ambrosine Limited.

846
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:04,463
Sir Charles will receive
his instructions from me.

847
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:06,549
It is the approach classique,
you see,

848
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:08,634
the technique of elimination.

849
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:15,224
We eliminate the suspects
one by one.

850
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:21,731
We do not scamper around
like the puppies.

851
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:31,449
Cynthia Dacres.

852
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:32,950
Thank you.

853
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:35,077
Fleur-de-lis on the cuffs.

854
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:36,704
Witty, don't you think?

855
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:39,457
And the waistline's
rather penetrating.

856
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:42,501
I shouldn't have it
in the red lead color, though.

857
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:44,837
I should have it in español.

858
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:47,632
And you've come into some money,
you say?

859
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:49,634
You have so much personality,

860
00:48:49,968 --> 00:48:52,261
you mustn't wear
anything ordinary.

861
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:55,681
Have you been back to
Cornwall since that party?

862
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:57,266
Oh, my dear, I couldn't.

863
00:48:57,392 --> 00:48:58,559
It was too upsetting.

864
00:48:58,685 --> 00:48:59,685
I know.

865
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:01,729
And you knew the vicar
from before

866
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:03,814
I think I remember him saying.

867
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:06,067
In a place called Gilling
in Kent?

868
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,402
Oh, no, no, no, Marcel.
No.

869
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:10,571
I asked for the blue pattu.

870
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:12,740
No, I would never go to Kent.

871
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:14,784
Why would I go to Kent?

872
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:16,786
What's in Kent?

873
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:18,746
-Perhaps Captain Dacres.
-Him?

874
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:21,290
No, he never leaves
the Seventy-Two Club,

875
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:24,669
except to lose money at some
stupid racecourse or other.

876
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:27,672
Which we can scarce afford
at times like these.

877
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:31,676
Oh, now, look.
This is lovely.

878
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:33,886
What did you say
your name was again?

879
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:35,096
Egg.

880
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:36,472
Hello, I'm bacon.

881
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:41,352
You have lovely eyes.
Has anyone ever mentioned that?

882
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:43,229
Tell me about
Reverend Babbington.

883
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:44,355
Who?

884
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:46,691
Babbington.
You knew him, didn't you?

885
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:48,609
In Gilling, wasn't it?

886
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:50,444
If you say so, my dear.

887
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:54,073
Sorry, just back from Newbury,
had a bit of a poxy day.

888
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:57,827
Funny thing is, I can understand
bumping off a doctor,

889
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:58,953
for obvious reasons,

890
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:01,414
but I can't understand
bumping off a parson.

891
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,790
Who'd want to bump off a parson?

892
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:04,125
Who'd want to bump off a doctor?

893
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:05,918
Lot of people.
Lot of people.

894
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:08,546
Doctors are interfering swine.

895
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:09,714
Did Bartholomew Strange --

896
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,466
Bartholomew Strange.
Bartholomew Humbug.

897
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:15,344
I'd like to know what goes on
in that sanatorium of his.

898
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:17,054
Nerve cases very likely.

899
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:19,932
All I know is, doesn't matter
what your nerves are like,

900
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:21,809
they lock you in
and you never get out.

901
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:24,603
And they call it a cure,
the swine.

902
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:33,404
Cynthia told me
not to talk about it.

903
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:35,364
Talk about what?

904
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:36,657
It. The thing.

905
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:37,950
-The Arab.
-The Arab?

906
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:40,369
There was this Arab gentleman
Cynthia was wooing.

907
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:42,204
He was going to invest
in Ambrosine,

908
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:43,956
which, by the way,
it badly needs,

909
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:45,374
because her head for business

910
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,251
is about as sound
as her dress-sense.

911
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,879
But he had some awful trouble
with his nerves.

912
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:53,090
He was seeing a fellow
in Harley Street, a specialist,

913
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:56,343
who packed him off on a cruise,
a world cruise.

914
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:57,887
Gone for good.
Arrivederci.

915
00:50:58,013 --> 00:50:59,346
And his checkbook with him.

916
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:01,682
And that specialist
was Bartholomew Strange?

917
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:03,559
Well, we don't know,
but if it was,

918
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:06,228
things would look a bit fishy
for us, wouldn't they?

919
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:08,939
Which is why I'm not supposed
to talk about it.

920
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:10,399
Now, you tell me something.

921
00:51:10,525 --> 00:51:12,568
What was that woman doing
in my room?

922
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:13,778
What woman?

923
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:15,696
The rabbit face.
The playwright.

924
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:17,448
Always poking and prying.

925
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:20,117
She's like a ferret
up a drainpipe, that one.

926
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,036
William.

927
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:25,790
"Evening Standard"!

928
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:28,751
Cornish exhumation!

929
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:36,258
Taxi! Taxi!

930
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,011
Miss Milray.

931
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:40,638
Oh.
Isn't it dreadful?

932
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:43,307
Miss Milray, are you all right?

933
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:45,101
Oh, hell.

934
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:46,644
I know, it's terrible.

935
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:48,979
Sorry. I'm overreacting.

936
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:51,273
I'm fine.
Really, really fine.

937
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:54,318
It's just I've known him
all my life.

938
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:57,404
-Mr. Babbington?
-Yes.

939
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,615
I grew up in Gilling
where he was vicar.

940
00:51:59,741 --> 00:52:00,866
All my family come from there.

941
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:02,451
Gilling?
But when --

942
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:05,412
Sorry. I must dash.
Awfully nice to see you again.

943
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:07,414
"Evening Standard"!

944
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:10,292
Vicar poisoned!

945
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:23,889
Such a pity you left
the profession, Sir Charles.

946
00:52:24,015 --> 00:52:26,225
You would have been perfect
in this one.

947
00:52:26,351 --> 00:52:27,268
What's it called?

948
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:28,686
"Sin in Suburbia."

949
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:30,563
Who's playing my part?

950
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:32,565
Geoffrey Winchester.

951
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:33,983
Oh, God.

952
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:37,111
No, no, no, he'll be wonderful.
I adore Geoffrey.

953
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:38,571
When do you open?

954
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:41,240
Next Thursday.
Come to the dress rehearsal.

955
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:42,408
Love to.

956
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:43,784
And you, M. Poirot.

957
00:52:45,203 --> 00:52:46,620
I like an audience.
Bring your friends.

958
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:47,997
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>

959
00:52:49,457 --> 00:52:52,459
Mademoiselle, I would like
to ask you something more

960
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:55,421
about the events so terrible
at Melfort Abbey.

961
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:58,257
Because if there was anything
to be noticed,

962
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:01,677
I believe that you,
the connoisseur of human nature,

963
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:03,554
you would have noticed it.

964
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,805
"Grist to my mill"?

965
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:06,348
<i>Peut-être.</i>

966
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:08,601
I was intrigued, I admit.

967
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:13,397
I'd never seen a murder
at close hand before.

968
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:16,358
Actually, there was one thing

969
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:18,861
I suppose I ought to have
informed the police,

970
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:20,196
if truth be known.

971
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:21,572
What was it?

972
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:24,033
Well, it was about the butler,
Ellis.

973
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:26,285
What was it?

974
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:30,247
He had a kind of strawberry mark
on his right wrist.

975
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:34,001
I noticed it
when he poured the port.

976
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:35,544
Ah.

977
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:37,671
No one else mentioned
a birthmark.

978
00:53:38,256 --> 00:53:39,298
Where exactly was it?

979
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:42,468
It was right here.

980
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:46,555
Roughly the size
of half a crown.

981
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:49,808
When you were in Yorkshire,

982
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:53,395
did Sir Bartholomew mention
a Mrs. de Rushbridger to you?

983
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:56,774
One of his patients.
Suffering from loss of memory.

984
00:53:57,275 --> 00:53:58,525
No.

985
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:01,820
Well, can you
tell us anything else at all

986
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:04,114
about any of the other guests?

987
00:54:05,867 --> 00:54:08,452
Sorry.

988
00:54:10,538 --> 00:54:11,789
Oh, well.

989
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:14,583
Sorry to disturb your rehearsal.

990
00:54:15,877 --> 00:54:17,044
Goodbye, Miss Wills.

991
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:19,255
Mademoiselle.

992
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:28,180
She knows something.
I'm sure she does.

993
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:30,891
<i>Faites attention, mon ami.</i>

994
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:32,935
You must be careful.

995
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:38,524
It may not be Mlle. Wills
that we must watch.

996
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:44,280
So, Cynthia Dacres
is desperate for money.

997
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:49,118
Possibly Dr. Strange ruined her
best chances of getting some.

998
00:54:50,328 --> 00:54:52,079
What about Oliver Manders?

999
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:53,872
Does his story ring true?

1000
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:56,417
Tollie Strange
writing him a letter?

1001
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:58,752
I have the impression
that it is not in keeping

1002
00:54:58,878 --> 00:55:00,296
with the character
of Dr. Strange

1003
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:01,964
to behave in such a fashion.

1004
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:04,675
I'm very suspicious
of Oliver Manders.

1005
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:09,763
What is his relationship
with Mlle. Milray?

1006
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:11,473
With Milray?

1007
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:12,516
He has none.

1008
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:14,476
The woman is incapable
of relationships.

1009
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:17,229
Osmosis, perhaps,
but not relationships.

1010
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:20,858
Now, Oliver Manders was present
at both murders

1011
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:23,485
and now he's keeping
his head down.

1012
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:26,488
Is there a link
between Manders and Miss Wills?

1013
00:55:26,614 --> 00:55:27,865
I do not believe so.

1014
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:32,244
So, what are we going to do?

1015
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:36,623
Think.

1016
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,709
Think?

1017
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:40,919
It is a mental process.

1018
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:42,838
I know what it is.

1019
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:44,965
But can't we do something?

1020
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:48,552
For you, always the action,
eh, mademoiselle?

1021
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:52,264
Voilà. There are inquiries
to be made at Gilling.

1022
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:54,808
The mother of Mlle. Milray.

1023
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:58,103
And I wonder, if you would be
so kind, the both of you,

1024
00:55:58,229 --> 00:55:59,229
to find out what you can

1025
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:01,190
about the past
of the Reverend Babbington.

1026
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:02,566
Righto.

1027
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:03,609
In the meantime,

1028
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:05,903
I will make the preparations
for my sherry party.

1029
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:07,279
A sherry party?

1030
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:10,199
<i>Oui.</i>

1031
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:12,701
Tomorrow evening at 8:00.

1032
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:16,955
It is the fashionable thing
to do, n'est-ce pas?

1033
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:25,130
<i>Ah, mesdames et messieurs,
un moment s'il vous plaît.</i>

1034
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:29,093
Let us have no talk
of murders and poisons

1035
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:31,887
because it spoils the palate.

1036
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:33,555
Sir Charles?

1037
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:35,474
Thank you, Poirot.

1038
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,935
Thank you, George.

1039
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:40,521
Cynthia, charming dress.

1040
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,148
Thank you.

1041
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:45,317
Why do you bring me
to these awful places?

1042
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:46,860
It's how I pick up custom.

1043
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,947
Oh, like you picked up the Arab?
Like you picked up Sir Charles?

1044
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:53,784
Keep your filthy insinuations
to yourself.

1045
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:55,869
Ah.

1046
00:56:56,454 --> 00:56:58,705
To marry an older man,
I think, is safer.

1047
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:01,417
His follies are behind him.

1048
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:04,002
Not, as with younger fellows,
still to come.

1049
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:06,672
I wish that I shared
your certainty, madame.

1050
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:08,841
Oh, but we have been
so badly off.

1051
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:12,302
I want Egg to see
people, places,

1052
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:17,141
great cities, great art.

1053
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:22,104
Don't know how you put up
with it.

1054
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:23,605
What do you mean?

1055
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:25,149
Him barging in like that.

1056
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:26,525
He's a has-been.

1057
00:57:27,735 --> 00:57:28,694
A washout.

1058
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,070
A flop.

1059
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:32,156
You're right.
I should --

1060
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:34,491
M. Oliver,
I wish to ask you something.

1061
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:37,244
The letter you received
from Dr. Strange --

1062
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:39,538
the invitation to --
How do you say --

1063
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:41,915
gate-crash the party --

1064
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:43,292
where is it?

1065
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:44,877
Oh, I burnt it.

1066
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:47,588
But why?

1067
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:49,423
Well, after he was killed,

1068
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:51,550
I thought
it might incriminate me.

1069
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:53,844
But the police
didn't even notice me.

1070
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:56,138
And tell to me, if you please,

1071
00:57:56,598 --> 00:57:59,808
what is it that prevents you
from proposing to Mlle. Egg?

1072
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:01,768
I haven't any money.

1073
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:03,854
Can't you see?

1074
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:05,939
Here's to you.

1075
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:09,234
You've changed my life.

1076
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,361
Sometimes I feel like
I'm bad luck.

1077
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:13,030
Like a bad penny.

1078
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:14,448
Oh, don't be absurd.

1079
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:16,617
Poirot, off to Gilling tomorrow?

1080
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:18,660
<i>Oui.</i>

1081
00:58:18,786 --> 00:58:21,455
But Mlle. Milray, where is she?
She is not here.

1082
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:23,332
I'm sure that I invited her.

1083
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:26,335
Good health,
and God save the king.

1084
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:29,588
I'll have another sherry, chum.

1085
00:58:30,715 --> 00:58:33,133
The sherry,
I prefer it to the cocktail,

1086
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:35,135
and a thousand times
to the whiskey.

1087
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:36,845
Ah, the whiskey, quelle horreur.

1088
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:38,388
But the delicate wines
of France,

1089
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:39,473
you have merely to taste these.

1090
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:40,599
Charles.

1091
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:41,767
Charles!

1092
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:43,018
Dear God!

1093
00:58:43,144 --> 00:58:44,728
Charles.
Charles, no.

1094
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:47,022
Not you, Charles.

1095
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:50,776
<i>Mes amis.</i>

1096
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:55,739
You fool.

1097
00:58:56,574 --> 00:58:58,951
You absurd, play-acting
little fool!

1098
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:02,037
You think you know everything
about everything.

1099
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:03,622
But look what you've done.

1100
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:04,665
Gently, Egg.

1101
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:07,125
<i>A performance magnifique,
Sir Charles.</i>

1102
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:12,506
Bad luck.
Still here.

1103
00:59:13,758 --> 00:59:15,008
You beast.

1104
00:59:15,593 --> 00:59:16,843
Golly.

1105
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:18,637
But why?

1106
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:21,807
<i>Messieurs et mesdames,
I demand pardon of you all.</i>

1107
00:59:23,476 --> 00:59:24,768
This little farce,

1108
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:29,690
it was necessary
to prove to you,

1109
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:33,235
and also to me,

1110
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:36,863
one little fact that my reason
told to me it was true.

1111
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:39,199
I placed into
one of these glasses

1112
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:41,702
a teaspoon of the plain water.

1113
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:44,997
This water was to represent
the pure nicotine.

1114
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:48,667
And I asked Sir Charles to play
the victim here tonight.

1115
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,379
Sir Charles, superb.

1116
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:55,924
But suppose for one moment
that this was not a farce,

1117
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:58,010
that it was a real life.

1118
00:59:58,553 --> 01:00:00,012
What do you think the police

1119
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:02,222
will be the first thing
they will do?

1120
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:04,141
They'll analyze the glass.

1121
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:07,144
They will analyze the glass,

1122
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:09,813
and traces of the nicotine
it will be found, oui?

1123
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:11,356
Non, you make the error.

1124
01:00:11,899 --> 01:00:13,442
No nicotine will be found.

1125
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:14,860
Why not?

1126
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:16,570
Because that is not the glass

1127
01:00:17,196 --> 01:00:19,114
from which Sir Charles,
he drank.

1128
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:21,783
This is.

1129
01:00:22,535 --> 01:00:24,953
The theory of
the conjuring trick, mes amis,

1130
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:26,038
it is very simple.

1131
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:29,374
The attention can never be
in two places at the same time.

1132
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:31,627
While you were looking
at the body,

1133
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:34,963
Hercule Poirot,
he switches the glass.

1134
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:38,675
And this is how
both of the murders

1135
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:40,844
were hidden so expertly.

1136
01:00:42,096 --> 01:00:43,847
<i>Alors, faites attention.</i>

1137
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:47,142
I demand that you listen to me
most attentively.

1138
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:50,520
This murderer may strike again.

1139
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:53,815
If any one of you
knows anything at all...

1140
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:58,862
...now it is the time to speak.

1141
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,209
So you planned it all?

1142
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:13,418
<i>Oui.</i>

1143
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:16,463
Just to see if anyone noticed
if you switched the glasses?

1144
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:18,507
I also had another purpose.

1145
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:20,384
When Sir Charles, he fell dead,

1146
01:01:20,718 --> 01:01:22,386
I wished to see the expression

1147
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:25,013
on the face of one person
in particular.

1148
01:01:25,556 --> 01:01:26,807
And did you?

1149
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:28,183
<i>Oui.</i>

1150
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:29,726
Which person's?

1151
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:31,436
Ah, that is my little secret.

1152
01:01:34,732 --> 01:01:37,275
So you know who the murderer is?

1153
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:38,777
<i>Oui.</i>

1154
01:01:38,903 --> 01:01:40,487
Then have them arrested.

1155
01:01:41,614 --> 01:01:42,656
I cannot.

1156
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:45,325
Because until I know why
Stephen Babbington was murdered,

1157
01:01:45,451 --> 01:01:46,660
I have no proof at all.

1158
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:48,036
And I do not know why.

1159
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:49,788
Excuse me, sir.

1160
01:01:49,914 --> 01:01:53,291
A telegram.

1161
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:03,260
<i>Milles tonnerres.</i>

1162
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:08,807
"Please come at once.

1163
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:12,686
Can give valuable information.
Death of Bartholomew Strange.

1164
01:02:13,604 --> 01:02:14,980
Margaret de Rushbridger."

1165
01:02:15,106 --> 01:02:17,441
Margaret de Rushbridger?

1166
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,410
<i>Merci.</i>

1167
01:02:29,537 --> 01:02:33,707
Just change at Doncaster.
Thank you.

1168
01:02:46,512 --> 01:02:49,473
Looks like we're
not going to find out any more

1169
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,309
about the Reverend Babbington
from old Mother Milray.

1170
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:54,603
She died a month ago
when I was in France,

1171
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:55,979
and Milray didn't tell me.

1172
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:57,481
Oh, this is hopeless.

1173
01:02:59,233 --> 01:03:00,567
I wish Poirot was here.

1174
01:03:02,361 --> 01:03:03,612
Egg?

1175
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,572
Look at these names.

1176
01:03:07,408 --> 01:03:09,826
There are some
frightfully strange ones.

1177
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:11,953
There's a family of Shovepennys.

1178
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:14,414
And here's
a Mary Ann Sticklebucket.

1179
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:17,918
None of them
are as strange as mine.

1180
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:19,878
Cartwright?
That's not strange.

1181
01:03:20,004 --> 01:03:21,338
That's not my real name.

1182
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:22,756
It's an acting name.

1183
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:25,425
What's your real name?

1184
01:03:25,551 --> 01:03:26,676
Couldn't possibly tell you.

1185
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:28,220
-Why not?
-You'll laugh.

1186
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:29,262
No, I won't.

1187
01:03:29,388 --> 01:03:30,514
No, I can't tell you.

1188
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,808
What is it?

1189
01:03:34,769 --> 01:03:36,019
It's Mugg.

1190
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:38,772
My father's name was Mugg.

1191
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:43,777
That is genuinely catastrophic.

1192
01:03:44,445 --> 01:03:45,987
To go through life as a Mugg.

1193
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:48,740
And are you really a Charles,
Sir Charles?

1194
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,076
Or are you a sham
in all respects?

1195
01:03:51,577 --> 01:03:53,495
Well, are you really poisonous?

1196
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:56,665
Are you the Black Widow
everyone says you are?

1197
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:58,208
What?
What do you mean?

1198
01:03:58,793 --> 01:03:59,918
What about Robin Babbington?

1199
01:04:00,044 --> 01:04:00,961
Oh, I don't know.

1200
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:02,838
He was always wet.
He wore sandals.

1201
01:04:02,964 --> 01:04:05,632
Anyway, you were in Madras
with him. You tell me.

1202
01:04:05,758 --> 01:04:07,551
No, I was not in Madras
with him.

1203
01:04:07,802 --> 01:04:10,011
I found out afterwards
from the consul

1204
01:04:10,721 --> 01:04:13,306
that he'd sold his passport
and grown a beard.

1205
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:15,141
And you had nothing to do
with it?

1206
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:16,268
But of course I didn't.

1207
01:04:16,394 --> 01:04:17,727
And what about Oliver Manders?

1208
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:20,146
Are you trying to implicate him
in these murders,

1209
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:22,566
because Oliver
couldn't kill anyone.

1210
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:23,942
What are you up to?

1211
01:04:24,443 --> 01:04:26,695
Trying to clear the field
for yourself?

1212
01:04:27,905 --> 01:04:29,406
See off the opposition?

1213
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:31,908
No, of course I'm not.

1214
01:04:33,911 --> 01:04:34,953
I love you, Egg.

1215
01:04:35,079 --> 01:04:37,289
And I would very much
like to marry you.

1216
01:04:37,915 --> 01:04:40,375
I just haven't found
the courage to ask you.

1217
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:44,379
So, you mean
you've just been dithering?

1218
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:47,424
Well, yes.

1219
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:10,238
Yes, I remember you.
With Sir Charles.

1220
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:12,198
But you never told me your name.

1221
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:13,783
I call myself Hercule Poirot.

1222
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:15,285
And who do you want to see?

1223
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:16,870
Mme. de Rushbridger.

1224
01:05:17,246 --> 01:05:18,496
But don't you know?

1225
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:20,999
She's dead.
She died this morning.

1226
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:24,210
She's been poisoned.

1227
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:28,757
A box of chocolates
came for her by post.

1228
01:05:28,966 --> 01:05:30,967
They're liqueur chocolates.

1229
01:05:32,303 --> 01:05:33,553
Nicotine?

1230
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:38,266
Chemical analysis will show.

1231
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:42,270
Was she killed
to prevent her telling us

1232
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:45,273
what she knew, eh, Poirot?

1233
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:50,195
Or what she did not know,
Superintendent.

1234
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:54,532
I must waste no time.

1235
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:01,498
A lad from Melfort village says
he were given the telegram

1236
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:02,749
by a tramp.

1237
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:04,125
-A tramp?
-Aye.

1238
01:06:04,335 --> 01:06:07,212
The tramp says it came from
a loony lady in the nuthouse,

1239
01:06:07,338 --> 01:06:08,588
this nuthouse.

1240
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:12,175
Said he could have two bob
if he sent it.

1241
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:14,177
To me.

1242
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:15,553
Aye, to you.

1243
01:06:16,555 --> 01:06:17,806
<i>Bon.</i>

1244
01:06:18,891 --> 01:06:20,350
Superintendent, if you please,

1245
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:22,268
to take me
to the railway station

1246
01:06:22,395 --> 01:06:23,478
as quickly as you can.

1247
01:06:23,604 --> 01:06:25,522
And also,
there is one other thing

1248
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:28,108
that I would like you to do
for me.

1249
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:34,239
<i>Merci, George.</i>

1250
01:06:35,616 --> 01:06:39,035
Sir Charles telephoned from
his Belgravia residence, sir.

1251
01:06:39,203 --> 01:06:41,705
He's concerned that Miss Wills
has gone missing.

1252
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:43,039
He motored out to Tooting

1253
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:45,250
for the purpose
of a further interview,

1254
01:06:45,376 --> 01:06:49,004
but when he got there,
she was nowhere to be found.

1255
01:07:33,591 --> 01:07:37,135
Miss Lytton Gore, sir.

1256
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:49,355
<i>Merci, George.</i>

1257
01:07:50,983 --> 01:07:52,859
M. Poirot will see you now,
miss.

1258
01:07:52,985 --> 01:07:56,196
<i>Mademoiselle, s'il vous plaît.</i>

1259
01:07:56,864 --> 01:07:58,782
Good heavens,
what are you doing?

1260
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:01,576
Alors, I find that the building
of a house of cards

1261
01:08:01,702 --> 01:08:03,286
is -- is most stimulating

1262
01:08:05,289 --> 01:08:06,706
to my little gray cells.

1263
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:10,835
And so, whilst I was in the
railway station in Yorkshire,

1264
01:08:10,961 --> 01:08:11,961
I purchased this pack of cards.

1265
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:13,004
But these aren't real cards.

1266
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:14,047
<i>Non?</i>

1267
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:15,381
They've sold you Happy Families.

1268
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:17,008
It's a children's game.

1269
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:18,968
I haven't seen these in years.

1270
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:20,804
Master Bun, the baker's son.

1271
01:08:21,138 --> 01:08:22,555
Mr. Grits, the grocer.

1272
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:24,057
Oh, and here's me.

1273
01:08:25,142 --> 01:08:26,267
You?

1274
01:08:26,393 --> 01:08:28,269
Mrs. Mugg, the milkman's wife.

1275
01:08:28,646 --> 01:08:30,438
For I am to be
Mrs. Mugg, Poirot,

1276
01:08:30,856 --> 01:08:32,982
when I marry
Sir Charles Cartwright.

1277
01:08:33,234 --> 01:08:34,651
For that is his real name.

1278
01:08:34,902 --> 01:08:36,152
Well, wish me happiness.

1279
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:38,738
I've just told you
I'm engaged to be married.

1280
01:08:38,864 --> 01:08:40,115
<i>Pardon, oui, oui.</i>

1281
01:08:40,324 --> 01:08:42,784
But I do wish you happiness,
mademoiselle.

1282
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:45,787
But not the brief happiness
of youth,

1283
01:08:46,372 --> 01:08:48,289
but the happiness that endures,

1284
01:08:48,874 --> 01:08:50,500
happiness that is built
upon the rock.

1285
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:52,418
I'll tell Charles
you called him a rock.

1286
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:54,170
He'll think you're referring
to his acting.

1287
01:08:54,296 --> 01:08:55,713
God, they're paranoid,
aren't they?

1288
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,298
We think it's Miss Wills,
by the way.

1289
01:08:57,424 --> 01:08:58,550
<i>-The murderer.
-Pourquoi?</i>

1290
01:08:58,676 --> 01:09:00,552
Well, because she's gone missing
and she's creepy.

1291
01:09:00,678 --> 01:09:01,594
And the funny thing is,

1292
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:04,389
we're going to see a dress
rehearsal of her play tomorrow.

1293
01:09:04,515 --> 01:09:06,391
But will she be there?
Will she show up?

1294
01:09:06,517 --> 01:09:09,310
I'm so excited. I've never been
to a rehearsal before.

1295
01:09:09,436 --> 01:09:11,646
And Charles says
he'll take me backstage.

1296
01:09:11,772 --> 01:09:12,856
<i>Sacre.</i>

1297
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:14,232
Poirot?

1298
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:16,442
But Poirot has been blind.

1299
01:09:19,113 --> 01:09:20,363
Blind.

1300
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:22,490
Are you coming?

1301
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:24,367
-Hmm?
-To the theater?

1302
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:27,328
Oui, but of course.
And I shall bring everyone.

1303
01:09:27,788 --> 01:09:29,122
Everyone must come.

1304
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:31,833
Oh, do!
It's going to be fabulous.

1305
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:37,046
I shall round up the audience
but immediately.

1306
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:43,553
Paddington Station.

1307
01:09:54,273 --> 01:09:55,607
One moment, driver.

1308
01:09:57,193 --> 01:10:01,279
Follow that taxi if you please.

1309
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:06,177
Stop!

1310
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:08,846
You cannot do this,
mademoiselle.

1311
01:11:09,223 --> 01:11:12,350
It is evidence.

1312
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:25,947
It's so exciting.

1313
01:11:27,574 --> 01:11:29,575
It's only Geoff Winchester, Egg.

1314
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:32,328
Don't expect fireworks.

1315
01:11:55,894 --> 01:11:57,478
<i>Mesdames et messieurs,</i>

1316
01:11:58,230 --> 01:12:01,357
you have come to watch a dress
rehearsal of a play, hein?

1317
01:12:01,817 --> 01:12:03,067
Instead I give to you

1318
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:08,239
Hercule Poirot.

1319
01:12:15,539 --> 01:12:18,082
When the Reverend
Stephen Babbington died,

1320
01:12:18,876 --> 01:12:22,211
Sir Charles advanced the theory
that he had been murdered.

1321
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:24,172
I did not think it likely.

1322
01:12:25,090 --> 01:12:27,008
Stephen!
Stephen, please!

1323
01:12:27,426 --> 01:12:29,177
I could not figure to myself

1324
01:12:29,303 --> 01:12:31,846
why Stephen Babbington
should be murdered,

1325
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:33,264
never mind how,

1326
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:38,686
as there was no trace of poison
in his glass.

1327
01:12:41,648 --> 01:12:42,899
Until 24 hours ago,

1328
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:47,487
when I saw that this murder

1329
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:51,908
was both reasonable
and possible.

1330
01:12:54,745 --> 01:12:57,413
Who had the opportunity
to poison the cocktail

1331
01:12:58,082 --> 01:13:00,375
of the Reverend
Stephen Babbington?

1332
01:13:01,168 --> 01:13:02,418
Only Sir Charles

1333
01:13:02,753 --> 01:13:05,630
and his serving maid
who handed around the drinks.

1334
01:13:07,299 --> 01:13:09,425
But were either of these two
at Melfort Abbey?

1335
01:13:09,551 --> 01:13:10,843
No, no, they were not.

1336
01:13:11,303 --> 01:13:14,055
So they could be eliminated
from being suspects

1337
01:13:15,015 --> 01:13:16,265
very swiftly.

1338
01:13:17,726 --> 01:13:20,311
So, who had the best chance
to put the nicotine

1339
01:13:21,438 --> 01:13:24,357
in the glass of Dr. Bartholomew
Strange at Melfort?

1340
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:27,652
The butler, Ellis,
who disappeared.

1341
01:13:28,779 --> 01:13:32,824
But he, we knew,
was a blackmailer, merely.

1342
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:36,994
<i>But then I was visited
by a sensation curieux, hein?</i>

1343
01:13:38,497 --> 01:13:39,747
<i>Très curieux.</i>

1344
01:13:40,749 --> 01:13:43,584
I was certain that the person
who committed both of the crimes

1345
01:13:43,710 --> 01:13:45,670
must have been present
on both occasions.

1346
01:13:45,796 --> 01:13:47,672
Well, alors, that was obvious.

1347
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:50,007
But it appeared to me

1348
01:13:50,217 --> 01:13:53,219
that this obviousness was
an arranged obviousness.

1349
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:55,513
In other words,
it was too obvious

1350
01:13:55,639 --> 01:13:57,390
and therefore
not obvious at all.

1351
01:13:57,516 --> 01:13:59,934
I was certain that the person
who murdered

1352
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:03,855
the Reverend Stephen Babbington
and Dr. Bartholomew Strange

1353
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:07,692
must have been present on both
occasions but not apparently so.

1354
01:14:08,026 --> 01:14:10,570
And so, I am forced to
investigate once again

1355
01:14:13,532 --> 01:14:15,950
this butler so mysterious,
this M. Ellis.

1356
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:21,080
He appeared suddenly, hein,
out of the blue

1357
01:14:21,498 --> 01:14:22,999
a fortnight before the crime

1358
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:25,460
and disappears
but immediately afterwards.

1359
01:14:25,586 --> 01:14:27,712
And Poirot,
he comes to the conclusion

1360
01:14:27,838 --> 01:14:30,298
that he is dead,
and, in a way, I was correct.

1361
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:32,592
I recalled the remarks made
about him

1362
01:14:33,093 --> 01:14:35,553
by the parlormaid at Melfort,
Mlle. Annie.

1363
01:14:36,013 --> 01:14:38,139
Well, he arranged the work
different

1364
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:40,475
from any butler
I ever knew before.

1365
01:14:40,893 --> 01:14:42,768
Got his own method
sort of thing.

1366
01:14:43,228 --> 01:14:47,064
And, eventually, Poirot,
he came to realize why.

1367
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:53,154
Alors, this butler, M. Ellis,
was indeed dead.

1368
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:57,283
Why?

1369
01:15:00,412 --> 01:15:01,871
Because he never ever existed.

1370
01:15:01,997 --> 01:15:04,790
But Dr. Bartholomew Strange
was another matter.

1371
01:15:07,211 --> 01:15:09,295
He must have known
the true identity

1372
01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:11,422
of his temporary servant.

1373
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,716
Do we have any evidence
for this?

1374
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:16,677
Ah, oui.
His remark facetious.

1375
01:15:17,179 --> 01:15:19,430
You're an excellent butler,
Ellis.

1376
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:21,807
Said as the joke, hein?

1377
01:15:21,934 --> 01:15:23,726
But as told to us
by Mlle. Annie,

1378
01:15:24,686 --> 01:15:25,937
the lark.

1379
01:15:26,772 --> 01:15:29,190
And it would have been
a lark perfectly understandable

1380
01:15:29,316 --> 01:15:31,025
if the doctor had known
the butler.

1381
01:15:31,151 --> 01:15:33,319
It would have been
a lark totally understandable

1382
01:15:33,445 --> 01:15:35,112
if the butler was indeed...

1383
01:15:37,658 --> 01:15:39,992
Sir Charles Cartwright,
his old friend,

1384
01:15:43,038 --> 01:15:45,456
and the doctor
had known of this all along.

1385
01:15:48,919 --> 01:15:51,712
Serve the cheese now,
Ellis, would you?

1386
01:15:52,089 --> 01:15:53,214
And then we'll...

1387
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:54,674
I say, what's this?

1388
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:57,343
Oliver!

1389
01:15:57,469 --> 01:15:58,553
I'll say.

1390
01:15:58,679 --> 01:16:00,137
Shall I pour the port, sir?

1391
01:16:01,348 --> 01:16:02,265
Oh, yes, thank you.

1392
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:04,225
Is this where
your sanatorium is?

1393
01:16:07,479 --> 01:16:10,064
It has recently come
to my attention

1394
01:16:10,732 --> 01:16:11,983
that one of you...

1395
01:16:30,168 --> 01:16:32,587
And now, my heart,
it is breaking.

1396
01:16:33,839 --> 01:16:35,089
And, Charles,

1397
01:16:36,508 --> 01:16:38,426
it is you
who have broken my heart.

1398
01:16:40,804 --> 01:16:43,806
I hope you know where
you're going with this, Poirot.

1399
01:16:44,349 --> 01:16:48,102
Sadly, mon ami, I do.

1400
01:16:51,231 --> 01:16:54,150
You see, if anybody at
the dinner table that evening

1401
01:16:56,486 --> 01:16:59,030
had spotted that Sir Charles
was the butler.

1402
01:17:01,074 --> 01:17:04,201
the whole thing could be
passed off as a practical joke.

1403
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:05,620
But nobody did.

1404
01:17:05,746 --> 01:17:08,539
Oh, Sir Charles Cartwright
is the actor supreme.

1405
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:12,793
He is in disguise, and he played
the part but to perfection,

1406
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:16,422
even adding the little detail

1407
01:17:17,924 --> 01:17:22,678
of painting the birthmark
on the right wrist.

1408
01:17:24,598 --> 01:17:27,183
And so, the Dr. Bartholomew
Strange, he dies,

1409
01:17:27,934 --> 01:17:30,603
and this butler escapes
by the secret passage.

1410
01:17:31,146 --> 01:17:32,396
And two days later,

1411
01:17:32,773 --> 01:17:35,566
he is strolling about
the gardens of Monte Carlo.

1412
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:38,235
Now, what of the letters
of blackmail

1413
01:17:38,362 --> 01:17:41,113
behind the fireplace
in the room of this M. Ellis?

1414
01:17:41,239 --> 01:17:43,491
Sir Charles himself
uncovers them.

1415
01:17:43,784 --> 01:17:47,203
And the letter asking M. Oliver
Manders to fake the accident?

1416
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:48,245
What could be easier

1417
01:17:48,372 --> 01:17:50,331
than for Sir Charles
to write the letter himself

1418
01:17:50,457 --> 01:17:52,708
in the name
of Dr. Bartholomew Strange?

1419
01:17:53,168 --> 01:17:55,670
Because he wants to bring you
all together again, hein,

1420
01:17:55,796 --> 01:17:59,715
so that there are many,
many suspects.

1421
01:18:01,968 --> 01:18:03,636
And so I return to Mlle. Wills.

1422
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:06,931
<i>En effet, mes amis,</i>

1423
01:18:07,057 --> 01:18:09,183
Mlle. Wills noticed
the butler Ellis

1424
01:18:09,601 --> 01:18:12,395
more than anybody else
at the table that evening.

1425
01:18:12,854 --> 01:18:15,022
And when I interviewed her,
in this theater,

1426
01:18:15,148 --> 01:18:16,148
Sir Charles, at first,

1427
01:18:16,274 --> 01:18:18,484
he is gratified
that she spotted the birthmark.

1428
01:18:18,610 --> 01:18:21,946
Well, of course, he likes his
audience to notice his skill.

1429
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:24,949
But then la catastrophe.

1430
01:18:26,284 --> 01:18:28,369
I do not think
that until that moment

1431
01:18:29,913 --> 01:18:32,581
Mlle. Wills connected Ellis
with Sir Charles.

1432
01:18:32,874 --> 01:18:34,458
But she is an observer, hein?

1433
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:36,877
And when the drinks,
they are poured,

1434
01:18:37,587 --> 01:18:40,798
she notices not the drinks,
but the hands that held them.

1435
01:18:41,591 --> 01:18:42,550
And at that moment,

1436
01:18:42,676 --> 01:18:44,677
Mlle. Wills understood
that Sir Charles,

1437
01:18:44,803 --> 01:18:45,720
he was the butler,

1438
01:18:45,846 --> 01:18:47,805
because with or without
the birthmark,

1439
01:18:47,931 --> 01:18:49,181
the hand, it was the same.

1440
01:18:49,307 --> 01:18:50,558
And now he is worried.

1441
01:18:50,684 --> 01:18:52,309
He thinks she knows something

1442
01:18:52,436 --> 01:18:54,186
and believes
she is a danger to him.

1443
01:18:55,939 --> 01:18:59,358
When Sir Charles acted the death
scene at my sherry party...

1444
01:19:01,236 --> 01:19:03,320
Charles.

1445
01:19:03,447 --> 01:19:04,697
Charles!

1446
01:19:05,907 --> 01:19:09,034
...the face that I was watching
was that of Mlle. Wills,

1447
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:12,788
and I saw a look upon that face
of complete astonishment.

1448
01:19:13,331 --> 01:19:14,749
And it was then that I knew

1449
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:17,835
that Mlle. Wills
suspected Sir Charles,

1450
01:19:18,044 --> 01:19:20,379
and if Mlle. Wills suspected
Sir Charles,

1451
01:19:20,505 --> 01:19:22,798
then Sir Charles indeed
suspected Mlle. Wills.

1452
01:19:22,924 --> 01:19:25,551
And now she was in
the danger most grave.

1453
01:19:27,012 --> 01:19:29,054
So it was on the advice
of Hercule Poirot

1454
01:19:29,181 --> 01:19:30,973
that she leaves her London home.

1455
01:19:32,142 --> 01:19:34,351
<i>S'il vous plaît,
entrez, Mlle. Wills.</i>

1456
01:19:39,524 --> 01:19:42,777
<i>S'il vous plaît.
Asseyez-vous.</i>

1457
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:47,281
And she was wise so to do, hein?

1458
01:19:47,949 --> 01:19:49,325
Because the following evening,

1459
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:51,076
Sir Charles,
he drives to Tooting

1460
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:53,829
to dispose of the one person
he feared could expose him.

1461
01:19:53,955 --> 01:19:56,707
Mlle. Wills.

1462
01:19:58,585 --> 01:20:01,170
And now we come
to murder victim number three,

1463
01:20:01,296 --> 01:20:02,505
Madame de Rushbridger.

1464
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:04,507
How does she fit
into the puzzle?

1465
01:20:05,884 --> 01:20:08,427
It is my belief that on the day
of the sherry party

1466
01:20:08,553 --> 01:20:09,929
given by me, Hercule Poirot,

1467
01:20:10,055 --> 01:20:11,889
Sir Charles Cartwright rises
early that morning,

1468
01:20:12,015 --> 01:20:12,973
perhaps even at dawn,

1469
01:20:13,099 --> 01:20:14,934
to make the long journey
to Yorkshire

1470
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:16,852
where he disguises himself
as a tramp,

1471
01:20:16,978 --> 01:20:19,730
gives to a small boy
the telegram addressed to me,

1472
01:20:19,856 --> 01:20:21,941
Hercule Poirot,
at Whitehaven Mansions.

1473
01:20:22,067 --> 01:20:24,443
Ostensibly
from Mme. de Rushbridger,

1474
01:20:24,694 --> 01:20:28,280
when on my one and only visit to
the sanatorium with Sir Charles,

1475
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:30,491
I had never even mentioned
my name.

1476
01:20:30,742 --> 01:20:31,992
And why does he do this?

1477
01:20:32,494 --> 01:20:34,703
Because he needs Poirot
out of the way.

1478
01:20:35,413 --> 01:20:37,122
Oh, pardon, one other thing.

1479
01:20:37,415 --> 01:20:39,333
He even posted
a box of chocolates

1480
01:20:41,378 --> 01:20:45,130
to this poor woman
who knew nothing.

1481
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:48,634
In fact, she would tell to
Poirot that she knows nothing.

1482
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:49,677
Nothing at all.

1483
01:20:49,803 --> 01:20:51,804
How could she?
She was a decoy merely.

1484
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:53,681
And it is for this simple reason

1485
01:20:54,641 --> 01:20:59,562
that she is dead?

1486
01:21:04,484 --> 01:21:07,820
Suddenly, I saw how this murder
of Dr. Bartholomew Strange

1487
01:21:10,782 --> 01:21:13,033
was not only essential
but purposeful.

1488
01:21:16,037 --> 01:21:17,288
Well, I'm hooked.

1489
01:21:17,581 --> 01:21:18,831
Oh, go on, tell me,

1490
01:21:19,291 --> 01:21:22,209
what was my motive
for murdering my dearest friend?

1491
01:21:23,587 --> 01:21:26,255
A man I had known since boyhood?

1492
01:21:27,757 --> 01:21:30,426
It was the doctor himself
who gave to me the clue

1493
01:21:31,177 --> 01:21:33,804
<i>when he said,
"Cherchez la femme."</i>

1494
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:37,683
You know, Sir Charles,
it was obvious to me

1495
01:21:37,809 --> 01:21:40,644
that you were in love, deeply
in love with Mlle. Lytton Gore.

1496
01:21:40,770 --> 01:21:45,357
You loved her with a passion
that was so arid, so terrible.

1497
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:47,651
So, why the hesitation?

1498
01:21:47,777 --> 01:21:49,695
Why did you not ask her
to marry you

1499
01:21:49,946 --> 01:21:52,072
when you were sailing
around Loomouth?

1500
01:21:52,198 --> 01:21:53,908
What was the obstacle, hein?

1501
01:21:54,784 --> 01:21:56,327
Poirot, he will tell to you.

1502
01:21:56,703 --> 01:21:59,788
The obstacle, it was this,
that you already had a wife.

1503
01:22:01,416 --> 01:22:04,501
Oh, but, of course, you enact
the role of the bachelor,

1504
01:22:04,711 --> 01:22:06,003
but this marriage of yours,

1505
01:22:06,129 --> 01:22:08,005
it took place
since many years before,

1506
01:22:08,131 --> 01:22:09,089
when you were young.

1507
01:22:09,215 --> 01:22:11,383
Long before you were
Sir Charles Cartwright,

1508
01:22:11,509 --> 01:22:12,843
the actor renowned,

1509
01:22:13,553 --> 01:22:18,599
and when your name,
it was something else.

1510
01:22:19,893 --> 01:22:21,143
<i>Voyez, mes amis,</i>

1511
01:22:22,646 --> 01:22:25,522
there are only two situations
in the law of our land

1512
01:22:25,774 --> 01:22:28,025
when a divorce,
it cannot be permitted.

1513
01:22:28,234 --> 01:22:30,569
The first when either
the husband or wife

1514
01:22:30,779 --> 01:22:32,863
is serving a life sentence
in prison

1515
01:22:33,198 --> 01:22:35,449
and the second
when one or either of them

1516
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:38,744
is confined to a lunatic asylum.

1517
01:22:39,704 --> 01:22:40,955
Ah.

1518
01:22:42,082 --> 01:22:45,000
And, of course, Sir Charles,
you cannot kill her yourself

1519
01:22:45,126 --> 01:22:47,544
because immediately you would
become the prime suspect.

1520
01:22:47,671 --> 01:22:49,213
But what if nobody knew, hein?

1521
01:22:49,339 --> 01:22:51,674
Well, then, you'd be free
to marry Mlle. Lytton Gore

1522
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:54,218
without ever having the need
to tell to her the truth.

1523
01:22:54,344 --> 01:22:55,678
But one person did know

1524
01:22:56,179 --> 01:22:57,471
and one person only.

1525
01:22:57,764 --> 01:22:59,098
Your oldest friend.

1526
01:23:01,017 --> 01:23:02,601
The best man at your wedding.

1527
01:23:04,437 --> 01:23:06,188
And so before you can re-marry,

1528
01:23:06,648 --> 01:23:09,316
it is necessary
that Dr. Bartholomew Strange,

1529
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:11,819
your friend so dear to you,

1530
01:23:12,445 --> 01:23:13,862
he must be eliminated.

1531
01:23:15,156 --> 01:23:16,407
And Babbington?

1532
01:23:17,242 --> 01:23:18,784
I suppose he knew, too, hmm?

1533
01:23:19,202 --> 01:23:21,620
That was the one flaw
in my theory.

1534
01:23:24,499 --> 01:23:26,375
Because even if it was you,
Charles,

1535
01:23:26,501 --> 01:23:28,502
who placed the liquid nicotine
into the glass,

1536
01:23:28,628 --> 01:23:31,714
you could never make sure of it
reaching one particular person.

1537
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:34,008
No, the poison was never
intended specifically

1538
01:23:34,134 --> 01:23:35,843
for the Reverend
Stephen Babbington.

1539
01:23:35,969 --> 01:23:36,969
No.

1540
01:23:37,095 --> 01:23:39,888
It was intended for anyone
who was there present.

1541
01:23:40,557 --> 01:23:43,142
Except, of course,
Dr. Bartholomew Strange,

1542
01:23:43,518 --> 01:23:45,436
who never touched the cocktail,

1543
01:23:45,603 --> 01:23:47,021
and Mlle. Lytton Gore.

1544
01:23:48,815 --> 01:23:54,903
The young lady
with whom you were in love.

1545
01:23:55,613 --> 01:23:57,698
You handed me my cocktail
yourself.

1546
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:01,076
Have a cocktail, Egg.

1547
01:24:18,011 --> 01:24:19,636
This tastes slightly...

1548
01:24:19,763 --> 01:24:22,890
The murder of
the Reverend Stephen Babbington

1549
01:24:23,475 --> 01:24:26,268
was nothing more nor less
than a dress rehearsal.

1550
01:24:26,936 --> 01:24:28,520
Sir Charles, he is the actor.

1551
01:24:28,772 --> 01:24:31,356
He rehearses the murder
before he commits it.

1552
01:24:31,733 --> 01:24:33,525
And the rehearsal, it goes well.

1553
01:24:33,777 --> 01:24:35,444
Stephen Babbington, he dies,

1554
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:37,196
and foul play,
it is not suspected.

1555
01:24:37,322 --> 01:24:38,447
Not even by Hercule Poirot.

1556
01:24:38,573 --> 01:24:41,700
Which is why, of course,
I was invited to go to Loomouth,

1557
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:44,036
because if Poirot
suspects nothing,

1558
01:24:44,162 --> 01:24:45,871
nor indeed will anyone else.

1559
01:24:46,289 --> 01:24:50,042
Et enfin, Mlle. Milray.

1560
01:24:52,003 --> 01:24:53,253
You knew that your employer

1561
01:24:53,379 --> 01:24:55,130
conducted
the chemical experiments

1562
01:24:55,256 --> 01:24:56,465
in the tower in the wood.

1563
01:24:56,591 --> 01:24:59,259
In fact, it was you who paid
the bills for the solution

1564
01:24:59,385 --> 01:25:00,886
for the spraying of the roses.

1565
01:25:01,805 --> 01:25:03,555
But you knew he was no gardener.

1566
01:25:04,766 --> 01:25:06,642
And when you read
about the death

1567
01:25:06,810 --> 01:25:08,811
of the Reverend
Stephen Babbington,

1568
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:11,688
that he was poisoned
by this very same solution,

1569
01:25:11,856 --> 01:25:13,315
you did not know what to do.

1570
01:25:13,566 --> 01:25:15,651
You had known
the Reverend Babbington

1571
01:25:15,777 --> 01:25:17,277
since you were a little girl.

1572
01:25:17,403 --> 01:25:19,822
But now you are in love
with your employer,

1573
01:25:22,158 --> 01:25:23,575
who is so fascinating.

1574
01:25:24,619 --> 01:25:26,787
But when you heard about the
death of Mme. de Rushbridger,

1575
01:25:26,913 --> 01:25:28,539
you decided that enough,
it was enough.

1576
01:25:28,665 --> 01:25:30,165
So you traveled
all the way to Cornwall

1577
01:25:30,291 --> 01:25:32,417
to destroy the apparatus
in the tower

1578
01:25:32,585 --> 01:25:34,336
to protect the man who you love.

1579
01:25:37,382 --> 01:25:41,343
But Poirot,
he has prevented you.

1580
01:25:42,804 --> 01:25:46,515
Superintendent, if you please.

1581
01:25:53,022 --> 01:25:55,274
What I have here, sir,
is your passport.

1582
01:25:58,194 --> 01:26:00,445
We know exactly
when you went to France.

1583
01:26:01,322 --> 01:26:02,573
And I have here a note

1584
01:26:05,285 --> 01:26:08,078
that proves that in
the Haburton Asylum in Essex,

1585
01:26:11,082 --> 01:26:13,667
there is a lady by the name
of Gladys Mary Mugg,

1586
01:26:17,964 --> 01:26:19,214
58 years of age,

1587
01:26:20,341 --> 01:26:24,761
who is your lawful wedded wife.

1588
01:26:30,643 --> 01:26:36,064
Is it true?

1589
01:26:36,357 --> 01:26:37,691
Egg...

1590
01:26:39,694 --> 01:26:42,112
...it's all lies.

1591
01:26:48,828 --> 01:26:52,039
It is true, mademoiselle.

1592
01:27:03,134 --> 01:27:04,760
I loved you.

1593
01:27:08,431 --> 01:27:11,725
God damn you.

1594
01:27:13,269 --> 01:27:16,772
What have you done?

1595
01:27:18,858 --> 01:27:20,108
What have I done?!

1596
01:27:22,278 --> 01:27:26,114
It is you who have deceived me!

1597
01:27:31,955 --> 01:27:35,415
These last two days,
they have not been genial.

1598
01:27:36,876 --> 01:27:40,254
You are deranged, monsieur.

1599
01:27:43,007 --> 01:27:46,468
Deranged.

1600
01:27:48,972 --> 01:27:52,975
You don't know what it's like.

1601
01:28:15,248 --> 01:28:17,040
People think you're so happy,

1602
01:28:17,792 --> 01:28:20,460
so glamorous.

1603
01:28:21,921 --> 01:28:23,213
Girls run after you,

1604
01:28:24,507 --> 01:28:25,799
beautiful girls.

1605
01:28:27,051 --> 01:28:31,513
You kiss them,
and then they go home.

1606
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:36,727
They take off
their pretty costumes,

1607
01:28:36,894 --> 01:28:38,145
and they go home.

1608
01:28:40,565 --> 01:28:44,276
And you're alone.

1609
01:28:46,738 --> 01:28:49,406
I would have loved you, Egg,
till the day I died.

1610
01:28:52,201 --> 01:28:54,870
That's all I wanted.

1611
01:28:57,373 --> 01:28:59,666
Love.

1612
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:03,587
Is that so much to ask?

1613
01:29:03,838 --> 01:29:07,841
It's not enough to kill
three people for.

1614
01:29:10,636 --> 01:29:11,887
My friend.

1615
01:29:14,682 --> 01:29:18,477
Your revels now are ended.

1616
01:29:19,103 --> 01:29:21,063
Oh, well.

1617
01:29:23,232 --> 01:29:24,483
Damn you.

1618
01:29:32,784 --> 01:29:35,285
Damn you all.

1619
01:29:52,303 --> 01:29:55,347
Don't worry, sir.

1620
01:30:08,569 --> 01:30:09,820
M. Manders,

1621
01:30:11,447 --> 01:30:12,697
I think now is the time

1622
01:30:13,032 --> 01:30:15,283
to take home the Lady Mary
and Mlle. Egg.

1623
01:30:15,827 --> 01:30:18,578
Yes, sir, of course.

1624
01:30:19,163 --> 01:30:21,248
You will look after her now.

1625
01:30:21,707 --> 01:30:24,501
I shall.

1626
01:30:29,465 --> 01:30:31,883
And, mademoiselle.

1627
01:30:34,637 --> 01:30:37,139
You fall down, hein?

1628
01:30:39,225 --> 01:30:41,643
But you will get up again.

1629
01:30:59,162 --> 01:31:00,871
A tragedy in three acts,
I think.

1630
01:31:00,997 --> 01:31:02,247
<i>Oui.</i>

1631
01:31:02,790 --> 01:31:05,167
A great man brought low.

1632
01:31:07,295 --> 01:31:09,838
I can see now I should have gone
to the police.

1633
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:12,382
Don't judge me too harshly.

1634
01:31:12,508 --> 01:31:14,259
Ah, mademoiselle, I investigate.

1635
01:31:14,385 --> 01:31:17,512
I do not judge.

1636
01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:20,807
I've just had
a terrible thought.

1637
01:31:21,893 --> 01:31:24,769
If anyone could have drunk
the poisoned cocktail,

1638
01:31:25,688 --> 01:31:28,523
golly, it could have been me.

1639
01:31:31,194 --> 01:31:33,862
And there is a possibility
even more terrible,

1640
01:31:34,155 --> 01:31:36,615
mademoiselle.

1641
01:31:39,202 --> 01:31:41,703
It could have been me.
