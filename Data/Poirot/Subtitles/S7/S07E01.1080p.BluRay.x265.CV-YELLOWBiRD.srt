1
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:05,512
A man may labour and toil to attain a
certain kind of leisure in retirement,

2
00:01:05,603 --> 00:01:11,228
and then find that, after all,
he yearns for the old busy days

3
00:01:11,895 --> 00:01:15,905
and the old occupations he had
thought himself so glad to leave.

4
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:20,368
I had already begun to miss the
daily toil of my previous employment

5
00:01:20,405 --> 00:01:23,272
when I was flung back into the midst

6
00:01:23,309 --> 00:01:27,706
of the most perversely fascinating
work that there is in the world,

7
00:01:27,801 --> 00:01:30,258
the study of human nature.

8
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:35,808
A journal came into my possession

9
00:01:35,897 --> 00:01:41,274
in which a murderer had taken the
trouble to record for posterity

10
00:01:41,364 --> 00:01:46,241
the thoughts that had accompanied
a crime most dastardly.

11
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:51,371
Rarely have I come
across such bitterness,

12
00:01:51,461 --> 00:01:53,871
such envy and contempt of others,

13
00:01:53,966 --> 00:01:56,837
such haughtiness misplaced.

14
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:07,768
Our village, Kings Abbott, is, I imagine,
very much like any other English village.

15
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:13,653
A chilly medieval church stands at the top
of a single street of stone-built cottages.

16
00:02:14,745 --> 00:02:17,784
At the bottom of the street,
a bridge crosses a stream

17
00:02:17,876 --> 00:02:20,831
where the snotty-nosed
offspring of the poor

18
00:02:20,921 --> 00:02:24,292
perfect the most advanced
skill they will ever possess.

19
00:02:24,725 --> 00:02:28,675
Although to the casual observer
Kings Abbott is a friendly place,

20
00:02:28,711 --> 00:02:31,266
everything is not as it seems.

21
00:02:31,353 --> 00:02:33,535
Just scratch the surface

22
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:38,366
and you will find more jealousies
and rivalries than Ancient Rome.

23
00:02:39,032 --> 00:02:42,485
- Parker.
- I'm calling next door at Mr Poirot's

24
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:47,077
My little book is about the
murder of Roger Ackroyd -

25
00:02:47,169 --> 00:02:51,215
the events leading up to it, the
subsequent numbskull investigation,

26
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:57,559
and the final revelation to you alone,
dear reader, of the guilty party.

27
00:03:08,283 --> 00:03:09,992
Hello?

28
00:03:37,285 --> 00:03:42,328
Now I give up on you. You
shall torment me no longer.

29
00:03:42,417 --> 00:03:45,752
I will kill you!

30
00:03:53,725 --> 00:03:55,932
Sacr?

31
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:01,265
My dear doctor! I beg of
you a thousand pardons!

32
00:04:01,361 --> 00:04:05,726
But these vegetable marrows have
driven me to the edges of barbarity!

33
00:04:05,762 --> 00:04:08,992
Please to forgive me. I am
ashamed. I prostrate myself.

34
00:04:09,081 --> 00:04:11,573
What's the trouble, Poirot?

35
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:12,974
Ah, you know, Doctor,

36
00:04:13,011 --> 00:04:17,754
it is my desire to grow a vegetable
marrow of proportions gigantesque.

37
00:04:17,844 --> 00:04:19,160
And you have seen how I nurse her.

38
00:04:19,197 --> 00:04:24,007
Each day I give to her water, each
day I weed her with my best tweezers.

39
00:04:24,103 --> 00:04:28,602
And when those little flowers of hers
they show themselves, I remove them all,

40
00:04:28,693 --> 00:04:31,565
but one, so that her
strength may be conserved.

41
00:04:31,656 --> 00:04:34,694
Does she appreciate this cosseting? No.

42
00:04:34,786 --> 00:04:38,453
She grows to a size that is merely
conventional, then rests upon her laurels.

43
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:41,746
You mustn't upset yourself, Poirot.

44
00:04:41,837 --> 00:04:44,376
No. No, you are correct.

45
00:04:44,466 --> 00:04:46,876
But you can fiugure at yourself, James.

46
00:04:46,971 --> 00:04:52,014
When one retires, one hurls
oneself into new pursuits.

47
00:04:53,855 --> 00:04:56,608
Oh. Pardon, Monsieur Parker.

48
00:04:56,693 --> 00:05:00,146
- What can I do for you?
- I've come to take you to the factory, sir.

49
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,072
But it is just struck ten o'clock.

50
00:05:03,108 --> 00:05:05,906
My appointment was not until eleven.

51
00:05:05,999 --> 00:05:09,369
Yes, but Mr Ackroyd hoped you
wouldn't mind it being earlier.

52
00:05:09,461 --> 00:05:11,502
He's got a bit of a busy day.

53
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:19,969
Our only captain of industry is
the vulgarian, Mr Roger Ackroyd.

54
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:24,596
The factory from which Ackroyd's
ill-gotten wealth emanates

55
00:05:24,632 --> 00:05:28,564
encapsulates the life we lead here
- ferment and turmoil.

56
00:05:33,506 --> 00:05:36,038
- Have you got a penny, Poirot?
- Oui.

57
00:05:37,377 --> 00:05:39,170
Thank you.

58
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:42,756
Show Monsieur Poirot what
your acid can do, Ted.

59
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:53,225
It is here that he lines his pockets
by combining unlikely chemicals

60
00:05:53,318 --> 00:05:55,328
to make unnecessary products,

61
00:05:55,365 --> 00:05:59,072
while befouling the very air we breathe.

62
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:02,780
He likes to think of
himself as a scientist.

63
00:06:03,747 --> 00:06:07,128
I'm afraid the noise was a
bit too much for you, Poirot.

64
00:06:07,214 --> 00:06:09,005
Not at all.

65
00:06:09,092 --> 00:06:11,880
I envy you, mon ami.

66
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:15,810
Who would have thought those experiments at
the back of your little shop would lead to this?

67
00:06:15,846 --> 00:06:19,684
Your country house but a mile
or two away, and yet here,

68
00:06:19,721 --> 00:06:23,522
we have the challenges and
triumphs of great industry.

69
00:06:23,612 --> 00:06:27,943
I'm eternally grateful to you
for that first loan, Poirot.

70
00:06:28,036 --> 00:06:30,661
And you can't say you're not
without your own triumphs.

71
00:06:30,697 --> 00:06:35,330
And now you've got your reward
- the peace and quiet of the country, your garden.

72
00:06:37,247 --> 00:06:40,888
- You don't regret retiring down here, then?
- Oh, no, no. Not at all.

73
00:06:40,925 --> 00:06:44,515
For 30 years I was exposed
to the dark side of life.

74
00:06:45,187 --> 00:06:47,791
- It takes its toll, you know.
- I'm sure it does.

75
00:06:47,828 --> 00:06:51,687
And now, as you say, I have my reward.

76
00:06:53,657 --> 00:06:56,439
- Excuse me, Mr Ackroyd.
- What is it, Raymond?

77
00:06:56,476 --> 00:06:59,079
- Mr Paton is here, sir.
- Mr Paton?

78
00:07:00,417 --> 00:07:01,297
Your stepson, sir.

79
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:05,130
I know who Mr Paton is, thank
you, Mr Raymond. Let him in!

80
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,385
Why is it I can't stand that fellow?

81
00:07:08,837 --> 00:07:14,127
Eh bien. Now I must
return to Kings Abbott.

82
00:07:14,164 --> 00:07:18,522
Thank you very much, my friend, for
showing to me your factory magnifique.

83
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:23,207
I can't understand why you haven't been
before. You've been here nearly a year now.

84
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:26,786
But all in all, this has
been a good week for me.

85
00:07:27,112 --> 00:07:31,458
Read your newspaper on Saturday morning,
Poirot, under Forthcoming Marriages.

86
00:07:31,494 --> 00:07:34,289
You mean your stepson
and Mademoiselle Flora?

87
00:07:34,384 --> 00:07:37,385
Please to accept my congratulations.

88
00:07:39,914 --> 00:07:43,026
Ah, Ralph, my dear boy. You
remember Monsieur Poirot?

89
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:46,862
- Yes, of course. How are you, Mr Poirot?
- I am well, thank you.

90
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:50,485
- I regret I am on the point of departure.
- I'll get Parker to run you home.

91
00:07:50,521 --> 00:07:53,078
- See to it, Raymond, will you?
- Merci.

92
00:07:53,114 --> 00:07:55,122
- Au revoir.
- Goodbye.

93
00:08:01,336 --> 00:08:03,378
What are you doing here?

94
00:08:05,346 --> 00:08:07,755
With his ill-gotten gains,

95
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:11,501
Ackroyd has built himself
a truly ostentatious house,

96
00:08:11,538 --> 00:08:15,858
spending a fortune on architects'
and surveyors' fees, no doubt.

97
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:25,397
He lives there with the former wife of
his deceased brother, Mrs Vera Ackroyd,

98
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:27,749
and her daughter, Flora -

99
00:08:27,837 --> 00:08:30,756
vultures, eagerly awaiting his demise.

100
00:08:30,842 --> 00:08:33,251
- Shall I pour, Mrs Ackroyd?
- Yes.

101
00:08:33,345 --> 00:08:36,550
Oh, tea. Wonderful. Hello, Ursula.

102
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:39,348
- Shall I pour for you, Miss Flora?
- Yes, thank you.

103
00:08:39,438 --> 00:08:41,728
- Isn't this exciting?
- Tea?

104
00:08:42,305 --> 00:08:46,813
No, you goose. The forthcoming announcement.
And not before its time, either.

105
00:08:47,462 --> 00:08:51,038
Oh! Sorry. I'll um I'll get a cloth.

106
00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:54,492
I really don't know where
Roger finds these girls.

107
00:08:55,094 --> 00:08:56,579
Have you spoken to Ralph?

108
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:59,424
No, Mummy. He's in London.

109
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:02,962
You'd think he might telephone
on the occasion of his engagement.

110
00:09:04,475 --> 00:09:06,469
I er came down last night.

111
00:09:06,561 --> 00:09:08,056
I'm staying at the White Hart.

112
00:09:08,146 --> 00:09:09,653
Look, er Father...

113
00:09:09,689 --> 00:09:12,058
What's wrong with Fernly
Park all of a sudden?

114
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:14,146
There's nothing wrong with Fernly Park.

115
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,778
Look, I heard you're
announcing the engagement.

116
00:09:16,868 --> 00:09:18,410
Flora's all for it.

117
00:09:19,497 --> 00:09:21,076
Well, yes. Perhaps she is.

118
00:09:21,674 --> 00:09:24,619
You've been putting it off and putting
it off for three months now, nearly.

119
00:09:24,713 --> 00:09:26,671
I've been trying to find a job, Father.

120
00:09:26,757 --> 00:09:31,220
I always told your late mother that I would
look after you as if you were my own son.

121
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:33,277
- I know, but
- No buts. We...

122
00:09:34,436 --> 00:09:37,106
Didn't I say I did not
want to be disturbed?

123
00:09:37,189 --> 00:09:40,109
Mrs Ferrars is on the telephone, sir.

124
00:09:40,194 --> 00:09:41,653
Oh.

125
00:09:46,912 --> 00:09:50,532
- Hello?
- Roger? It's Dotty.

126
00:09:50,626 --> 00:09:52,666
I've got to see you.

127
00:09:52,755 --> 00:09:55,922
There's something I've got to tell you.

128
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,974
Ralph!

129
00:10:10,072 --> 00:10:12,694
I'll try to come round
late this afternoon.

130
00:10:12,784 --> 00:10:16,914
All right, all right! I'll definitely come
round late this afternoon. I'll be there.

131
00:10:19,045 --> 00:10:22,214
The highly-strung and
unpredictable Dorothy Ferrars

132
00:10:22,298 --> 00:10:25,170
is something of an
enigma to the villagers.

133
00:10:27,764 --> 00:10:30,220
She lives alone, in
considerable comfort,

134
00:10:30,309 --> 00:10:33,395
thanks to the wealth she
inherited from her late husband -

135
00:10:33,481 --> 00:10:37,397
a sot who died in suspicious
circumstances last year.

136
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,371
Dr Sheppard.

137
00:12:13,294 --> 00:12:15,335
Oh!

138
00:12:15,422 --> 00:12:17,914
In ten minutes.

139
00:12:21,348 --> 00:12:22,843
Who was that?

140
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:25,935
Inspector Davis.

141
00:12:31,297 --> 00:12:33,606
Now, tell me, Mary, my girl,

142
00:12:34,107 --> 00:12:36,618
why did you come to wake her so early?

143
00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:39,196
Friday was her morning to go riding.

144
00:12:39,777 --> 00:12:42,496
She liked to be out of the
house before six o'clock.

145
00:12:44,574 --> 00:12:46,592
All right, Mary. Thank you.

146
00:12:46,677 --> 00:12:48,718
Go and get yourself a cup of tea, eh?

147
00:12:57,838 --> 00:12:59,358
Veronal.

148
00:13:03,619 --> 00:13:05,280
You think it's suicide?

149
00:13:05,371 --> 00:13:07,412
Ask me after the inquest.

150
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:12,538
- It's a year since her husband died, isn't it?
- Almost exactly.

151
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,960
Did you find a note?

152
00:13:17,222 --> 00:13:18,883
Not yet.

153
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:47,172
Sheppard. I want to talk to you.

154
00:13:47,267 --> 00:13:50,968
- You've heard about Mrs Ferrars.
- Yes. I only saw her yesterday afternoon.

155
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:53,638
Come to Fernly Park tonight. 7:30.

156
00:13:58,937 --> 00:14:01,740
- I've been thinking about Dotty Ferrars.
- Oh, yes?

157
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:05,579
She must have taken the
Veronal on purpose. Remorse.

158
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:08,046
Remorse?

159
00:14:08,131 --> 00:14:12,344
You never would listen to me last year when I
told you she'd poisoned that awful husband of hers.

160
00:14:12,429 --> 00:14:13,804
This proves it.

161
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:16,131
Oh.

162
00:14:22,526 --> 00:14:24,686
- Oh, hello. Please do come in.
- Thank you.

163
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,822
We have a visitor, James.

164
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:32,698
- Oh, pardon. You are at your luncheon.
- No, no. We've just finished.

165
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:35,629
Hercule's come round
with a little job for you.

166
00:14:35,713 --> 00:14:39,927
- Oui. Ma pendule de voyage.
- Pendule?

167
00:14:41,554 --> 00:14:43,512
Ah! A carriage clock.

168
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:45,059
How say you, James?

169
00:14:45,143 --> 00:14:47,979
- Perhaps I have overwound her?
- No.

170
00:14:48,065 --> 00:14:51,316
It looks as if she
just needs a good clean.

171
00:14:51,402 --> 00:14:52,946
Ah.

172
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,774
I'll do what I can with it.

173
00:14:54,866 --> 00:14:57,156
It is good, I think,
to have the hobby, no?

174
00:14:58,412 --> 00:15:00,870
You've got your garden, Poirot.

175
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:04,042
Yes.

176
00:15:10,973 --> 00:15:12,302
- Good morning.
- Morning.

177
00:15:12,392 --> 00:15:16,438
- Just a little more time. You've got to be patient.
- Oh, for heaven's sake!

178
00:15:16,523 --> 00:15:20,268
My dear girl, it's quite on the cards the
old fellow will cut me off with a shilling.

179
00:15:20,305 --> 00:15:21,334
Of course he won't!

180
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:24,986
He's pretty fed up with me.
A little more would do it.

181
00:15:25,077 --> 00:15:26,905
And we need the dibs.

182
00:15:26,997 --> 00:15:29,619
I'll be a very rich man
when the old fellow pops off.

183
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:31,667
So we don't want him to alter his will.

184
00:15:31,753 --> 00:15:36,464
- Then why stay here, not at Fernly Park?
- Look, leave this to me.

185
00:15:36,552 --> 00:15:40,338
- Don't worry.
- Worry! It's all very well for you.

186
00:15:43,271 --> 00:15:46,855
- You'll feel more comfortable in a day or two.
- Thank you, Doctor.

187
00:15:47,986 --> 00:15:50,193
James, I Oh.

188
00:15:50,281 --> 00:15:51,741
Oh, I am sorry.

189
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:53,284
Goodbye.

190
00:16:04,844 --> 00:16:08,464
- He wasn't on your panel.
- No, my dear sister. Cash.

191
00:16:10,226 --> 00:16:12,304
I saw something quite peculiar just now.

192
00:16:12,396 --> 00:16:13,477
Really?

193
00:16:13,565 --> 00:16:17,399
First of all, Ralph Paton is here
and staying at the White Hart.

194
00:16:17,488 --> 00:16:18,602
Staying there?

195
00:16:18,697 --> 00:16:21,985
Staying there. And he
was talking to a girl.

196
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:25,745
I couldn't quite see who she
was. Presumably it was Flora.

197
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,874
But that doesn't make any sense.

198
00:16:27,962 --> 00:16:32,008
Mind you, it makes even
less sense if it wasn't.

199
00:16:53,082 --> 00:16:57,378
There is evil in this village,
Poirot. Downright evil!

200
00:16:57,463 --> 00:16:59,872
Well, tell me what
has happened, mon ami.

201
00:17:00,572 --> 00:17:03,088
You didn't know Ashley Ferrars, did you?

202
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:06,515
No. I believe that he
died before I arrived here.

203
00:17:06,602 --> 00:17:08,642
Yes, I thought so.

204
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:12,017
After he died, there were all
sorts of rumours flying about.

205
00:17:13,236 --> 00:17:15,943
Well, this sometimes
happens in a small town.

206
00:17:16,033 --> 00:17:22,037
Anyway, the coroner said gastritis
exacerbated by acute alcoholism,

207
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:25,293
then peritonitis, and that was that.

208
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:27,669
Until yesterday.

209
00:17:27,758 --> 00:17:29,965
Yesterday I found out he was poisoned.

210
00:17:31,096 --> 00:17:32,176
Poisoned?

211
00:17:32,264 --> 00:17:35,303
Look, I might as well
tell you this, Poirot.

212
00:17:36,276 --> 00:17:38,264
I've been

213
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:42,779
well, in love with
Dorothy Ferrars for years.

214
00:17:42,863 --> 00:17:44,987
She telephoned me yesterday.

215
00:17:45,075 --> 00:17:47,781
Very upset. Wanted to see me.

216
00:17:47,871 --> 00:17:49,449
She broke down completely.

217
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,581
She told me everything.

218
00:17:52,398 --> 00:17:54,997
Her hatred of that brute of a husband,

219
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:57,130
her growing feelings for me

220
00:17:58,929 --> 00:18:01,255
and the dreadful means she'd taken to.

221
00:18:02,425 --> 00:18:04,013
Poison!

222
00:18:05,355 --> 00:18:08,726
Murder! Cold-blooded murder!

223
00:18:08,819 --> 00:18:10,277
I see.

224
00:18:10,362 --> 00:18:13,697
The terrible thing is, she must
have seen the shock in my face.

225
00:18:13,784 --> 00:18:15,363
I mean, I couldn't disguise it.

226
00:18:18,124 --> 00:18:20,082
I drove her to suicide.

227
00:18:20,168 --> 00:18:23,123
But it was reported that
her death was accidental.

228
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:27,636
You must not blame yourself, mon ami.

229
00:18:27,722 --> 00:18:30,178
I know, but she also
told me something else.

230
00:18:31,268 --> 00:18:35,314
It seemed that there was one person
who'd known about the murder all along

231
00:18:35,399 --> 00:18:39,315
and was blackmailing her for huge sums.

232
00:18:39,405 --> 00:18:41,862
And do you know who was this person?

233
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,908
She wouldn't tell me his name.

234
00:18:43,995 --> 00:18:46,867
As a matter of fact, she didn't
even say it was a man, but

235
00:18:47,569 --> 00:18:50,914
Well, they're not going
to get away with it!

236
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:54,707
You intend to hunt
down this blackmailer?

237
00:18:54,802 --> 00:18:57,342
If only Dotty had left a note.

238
00:18:57,432 --> 00:18:59,971
She might have given a name.

239
00:19:00,061 --> 00:19:02,101
Roger

240
00:19:03,941 --> 00:19:05,352
you must be careful.

241
00:19:07,656 --> 00:19:09,696
Thank you, Ursula.

242
00:19:13,915 --> 00:19:15,409
Ah, Sheppard. Good evening.

243
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,789
Good evening. Evening, Poirot.

244
00:19:17,878 --> 00:19:20,881
- Good evening, James.
- I'm just seeing Monsieur Poirot out.

245
00:19:20,966 --> 00:19:23,921
- Go on into the sitting room, will you?
- Thank you.

246
00:19:28,227 --> 00:19:30,351
Thank you, Monsieur Parker.

247
00:19:32,233 --> 00:19:34,273
Ah.

248
00:19:34,361 --> 00:19:37,862
Hello, Dr Sheppard. I didn't
know you were coming this evening.

249
00:19:39,076 --> 00:19:41,441
- You know, you've got to congratulate me.
- Indeed?

250
00:19:41,477 --> 00:19:44,662
Look. I'm going to marry Ralph.

251
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:48,205
I know you'll both be very happy, Flora.

252
00:19:48,298 --> 00:19:52,215
We've been engaged for three months now,
but it's announced officially tomorrow.

253
00:19:54,148 --> 00:19:55,424
Why, Dr Sheppard!

254
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:58,768
Good evening, Mrs Ackroyd.

255
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,067
Is it true about poor Mrs Ferrars?

256
00:20:03,154 --> 00:20:05,278
She died last night. Yes.

257
00:20:05,365 --> 00:20:06,860
Did she...

258
00:20:06,951 --> 00:20:09,490
Was it suicide?

259
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,906
We don't know yet.

260
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,040
Poor woman.

261
00:20:14,128 --> 00:20:15,540
Oh, well.

262
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,959
Life must go on, I suppose.

263
00:20:23,768 --> 00:20:27,138
I wish you'd tell me about these
antique things, Dr Sheppard.

264
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:30,066
I'm sure you know what they all are.

265
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:32,903
Just because I'm an antique myself.

266
00:20:35,047 --> 00:20:37,319
Ah, Sheppard. There you are.

267
00:20:37,412 --> 00:20:41,626
Look, you're staying to dinner,
aren't you? We can talk later.

268
00:21:27,528 --> 00:21:28,808
Fernly Park.

269
00:21:28,905 --> 00:21:32,738
- Is Monsieur Roger Ackroyd available?
- No. He's at dinner, Mr Poirot.

270
00:21:32,827 --> 00:21:34,239
- At dinner?
- Yes.

271
00:21:34,329 --> 00:21:37,747
Could I leave a message for him
to call me back? I'm at my cottage.

272
00:21:37,835 --> 00:21:39,496
I'll ask him to call you.

273
00:21:39,588 --> 00:21:42,459
And will you be sure to
give him the message now?

274
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,591
Certainly, sir.

275
00:21:52,815 --> 00:21:57,728
So I said, just because you're breaking eggs,
it doesn't mean you're making an omelette.

276
00:21:59,033 --> 00:22:01,869
My late husband detested omelettes.

277
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:05,241
Mr Poirot telephoned, sir. I
told him you were at dinner.

278
00:22:05,334 --> 00:22:07,873
Thank you, Parker. I'll phone him later.

279
00:22:07,962 --> 00:22:13,636
In fact, my late husband disliked
anything even remotely to do with chickens.

280
00:22:20,106 --> 00:22:22,977
- Last post. Feels like it, too.
- Thanks, Barney.

281
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,540
The evening post, sir.

282
00:22:35,628 --> 00:22:39,129
Put the other letters on
the table, Parker, thank you.

283
00:22:39,217 --> 00:22:40,843
Yes, sir.

284
00:22:50,525 --> 00:22:54,394
"My dear, my very dear Roger"

285
00:22:57,786 --> 00:23:01,619
There is one thing a murderer
may rely on for protection.

286
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:04,082
That the account of every witness

287
00:23:04,171 --> 00:23:07,291
will be radically different
from the account of every other,

288
00:23:07,383 --> 00:23:10,801
even though all were
present on the same occasion.

289
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,345
I trust you enjoyed
your dinner, Dr Sheppard.

290
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:15,724
Indeed, I did. Thank you, Parker.

291
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:19,314
- Oh, I'll just go and say good night to the ladies.
- Yes, sir.

292
00:23:24,784 --> 00:23:28,404
- Good night, ladies.
- Oh. Do you have to go, Doctor?

293
00:23:28,498 --> 00:23:31,785
Oh, unfortunately, I do. Good night.

294
00:23:31,878 --> 00:23:34,584
And once again, congratulations, Flora.

295
00:23:34,673 --> 00:23:37,296
Thank you, Dr Sheppard. Good night.

296
00:24:16,819 --> 00:24:21,150
However, I regret to say that the
calls on my purse have been so frequent

297
00:24:21,242 --> 00:24:24,364
that it it impossible for
me to accede to your request.

298
00:24:24,455 --> 00:24:26,496
As you will appreciate

299
00:25:01,969 --> 00:25:05,719
Parker, Mr Ackroyd says he doesn't
want to be disturbed tonight.

300
00:25:05,807 --> 00:25:08,645
Oh. Very well, Miss Flora.

301
00:25:14,445 --> 00:25:17,365
It doesn't sound like a very
interesting evening, I must say.

302
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:19,740
Didn't you hear anything
about Ralph, even?

303
00:25:19,829 --> 00:25:23,828
Well, yes. I heard he got
officially engaged to Flora at last.

304
00:25:23,918 --> 00:25:27,787
Then what was that I heard him saying
to her this afternoon at the White Hart?

305
00:25:27,882 --> 00:25:30,291
Who can say, my dear?

306
00:25:30,386 --> 00:25:33,008
Why do people always
choose bedtime to get ill?

307
00:25:34,225 --> 00:25:35,600
Doctor Sheppard.

308
00:25:36,687 --> 00:25:37,933
What?

309
00:25:39,023 --> 00:25:40,602
What?

310
00:25:40,693 --> 00:25:42,686
Yes, I'll come at once.

311
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,323
What is it?

312
00:25:45,408 --> 00:25:48,779
- What is it, James?
- It's Parker. From Fernly.

313
00:25:50,499 --> 00:25:53,703
They've just found
Roger Ackroyd murdered.

314
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,436
- Yes, sir?
- Where is he?

315
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:09,902
Beg your pardon, sir?

316
00:26:09,944 --> 00:26:12,353
- Have you called the police?
- The police, sir?

317
00:26:12,448 --> 00:26:16,198
What's the matter with you, Parker?
Your master has been found murdered.

318
00:26:17,256 --> 00:26:18,079
Murdered, sir?

319
00:26:18,165 --> 00:26:22,414
Didn't you telephone me five minutes
ago and tell me Mr Ackroyd was murdered?

320
00:26:22,504 --> 00:26:24,582
No, indeed, sir. I wouldn't dream.

321
00:26:24,674 --> 00:26:26,964
Do you mean to say it's all a hoax?

322
00:26:28,262 --> 00:26:30,755
Oh, thank God!

323
00:26:31,935 --> 00:26:34,343
Though I should like
to strangle the joker.

324
00:26:34,438 --> 00:26:36,931
I can check, sir. See if
everything's all right.

325
00:26:37,026 --> 00:26:39,020
No, no, there's no point in that.

326
00:26:39,112 --> 00:26:42,067
- Let me just go and see, sir.
- Where's everybody else?

327
00:26:42,158 --> 00:26:45,410
The ladies have gone to bed, sir.
I believe Mr Raymond is still up.

328
00:26:48,793 --> 00:26:50,418
It seems to be locked.

329
00:26:50,504 --> 00:26:51,999
Perhaps he's gone up to bed.

330
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:54,926
I've never known him to
lock this door before.

331
00:26:59,183 --> 00:27:01,343
The key's in the lock on the other side.

332
00:27:07,028 --> 00:27:09,069
Ackroyd?

333
00:27:10,366 --> 00:27:12,776
- Ackroyd!
- He may have fallen asleep.

334
00:27:18,461 --> 00:27:20,455
- I'm sorry, Parker.
- Dr Sheppard, sir!

335
00:27:20,548 --> 00:27:21,747
Out of the way!

336
00:27:25,054 --> 00:27:29,101
No. The fewer people disturb
this room, the better.

337
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:42,485
Ring the police station, Parker.

338
00:27:53,513 --> 00:27:57,727
Yes. Right away. Mr
Ackroyd's been murdered.

339
00:27:57,811 --> 00:27:59,639
What did you say?

340
00:28:00,941 --> 00:28:03,860
It's Mr Ackroyd, sir. He's dead.

341
00:28:03,946 --> 00:28:05,986
In the study.

342
00:28:07,826 --> 00:28:09,369
Oh, my God!

343
00:28:14,419 --> 00:28:18,371
What are you doing here? Oh, I'm
sorry, Mr Poirot. You'd better come in.

344
00:28:18,467 --> 00:28:20,508
Thank you.

345
00:28:21,596 --> 00:28:23,305
I was just telephoning the police.

346
00:28:23,391 --> 00:28:26,892
- What has happened, Monsieur Parker?
- Mr Ackroyd's been killed, sir.

347
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:29,020
Murdered.

348
00:28:33,906 --> 00:28:35,781
Who would do such a terrible thing?

349
00:28:35,867 --> 00:28:39,321
Oh, Poirot. Thank God!
Nobody's been in here.

350
00:28:46,174 --> 00:28:48,501
What do you think, Poirot?

351
00:28:56,607 --> 00:28:58,647
I have failed my friend.

352
00:29:08,332 --> 00:29:12,996
Our local police are a constant
source of harmless amusement.

353
00:29:14,049 --> 00:29:18,179
A year ago, they could not even see that
the death of Ashley Ferrars was murder.

354
00:29:19,306 --> 00:29:24,018
This time, they will probably claim
that Ackroyd committed suicide.

355
00:29:28,362 --> 00:29:31,114
Ackroyd was in such a
strange mood all day.

356
00:29:31,199 --> 00:29:33,869
Mrs Ferrars dying hit him badly.

357
00:29:33,953 --> 00:29:35,993
Evening, gentlemen.

358
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,748
Has this been moved at all?

359
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:44,842
I ascertained that life
was extinct, nothing more.

360
00:29:45,929 --> 00:29:47,258
Who found the body?

361
00:29:47,348 --> 00:29:50,682
Parker and myself. I'd
been here to dinner,

362
00:29:50,769 --> 00:29:53,642
but I was back at home when I
got a telephone call from Parker

363
00:29:53,732 --> 00:29:56,307
telling me Mr Ackroyd had been murdered.

364
00:29:56,403 --> 00:29:58,112
Parker had already found the body?

365
00:29:58,197 --> 00:30:01,650
No, sir. I didn't make
any phone call, sir.

366
00:30:01,744 --> 00:30:04,034
Wait a minute. Dr Sheppard says...

367
00:30:04,123 --> 00:30:06,496
I didn't phone, sir. I swear I didn't!

368
00:30:06,584 --> 00:30:09,041
Did it sound like Parker's
voice on the telephone?

369
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:14,210
I can't say I noticed. I
took it for granted, you see.

370
00:30:15,556 --> 00:30:18,428
How odd. Anyway, you came in here...

371
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:21,225
Broke the door down. It
was locked from the inside.

372
00:30:21,315 --> 00:30:23,355
Has anyone checked the window?

373
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:35,665
Well, this is the way the murderer came in
all right, and went out. Look. A footprint.

374
00:30:35,753 --> 00:30:38,245
Made by a boot with a rubber sole, sir.

375
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,629
When was Mr Ackroyd last seen alive?

376
00:30:40,718 --> 00:30:43,970
I left at nine o'clock. He
was certainly alive then.

377
00:30:44,057 --> 00:30:46,596
He was alive at 9.30.

378
00:30:46,685 --> 00:30:48,928
I heard him talking in the study.

379
00:30:49,022 --> 00:30:52,274
- Who was he talking to?
- I don't know.

380
00:30:53,111 --> 00:30:55,438
At the time, I assumed
it was Dr Sheppard.

381
00:30:55,531 --> 00:30:58,902
But in fact, you'd already left.

382
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,204
Did you overhear any
of the conversation?

383
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:04,000
Just a fragment.

384
00:31:04,086 --> 00:31:06,328
Mr Ackroyd said something like,

385
00:31:06,422 --> 00:31:09,591
"The calls on my purse have
been so frequent of late

386
00:31:09,678 --> 00:31:12,845
that it is impossible for me
to accede to your request."

387
00:31:14,226 --> 00:31:15,935
I didn't hear any more.

388
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:19,167
But a demand for money.
It may be important.

389
00:31:19,204 --> 00:31:21,810
If you'll excuse me, Inspector Davis.

390
00:31:21,904 --> 00:31:25,108
Miss Flora saw him after half past nine.

391
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,571
I saw her leave the
study at ten past ten.

392
00:31:28,664 --> 00:31:31,749
- Send someone to get her, will you?
- Yes, sir.

393
00:31:34,881 --> 00:31:40,008
- I don't know you, sir. What's your name?
- This is Hercule Poirot, Inspector.

394
00:31:41,474 --> 00:31:43,764
The famous detective?

395
00:31:43,853 --> 00:31:46,724
Oh, yes? What are you doing here?

396
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:50,578
Monsieur Ackroyd was a
friend of mine, Inspector.

397
00:31:50,615 --> 00:31:53,153
I was with him earlier this evening.

398
00:31:53,241 --> 00:31:55,485
When was the last time
you saw Mr Ackroyd alive?

399
00:31:55,579 --> 00:31:59,744
We said goodbye at
7.36. I then went home.

400
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:01,792
What are you doing here now?

401
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,502
Monsieur Ackroyd was in
a mood of great upset.

402
00:32:04,592 --> 00:32:07,048
I was worried about him
and I made my return.

403
00:32:07,742 --> 00:32:09,379
Thank you, sir.

404
00:32:09,474 --> 00:32:13,604
I have to say this. Mr Ralph
Paton is down here from London.

405
00:32:13,688 --> 00:32:17,391
He came to the factory to see
Mr Ackroyd. They had words.

406
00:32:19,142 --> 00:32:20,060
What about?

407
00:32:20,156 --> 00:32:22,197
I don't really know.

408
00:32:23,286 --> 00:32:25,778
Something to do with Mr
Ackroyd's will, I think.

409
00:32:32,591 --> 00:32:34,632
Oh, this is awful.

410
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:36,547
It can't be true.

411
00:32:36,639 --> 00:32:39,427
Miss Ackroyd, I'm afraid I
must ask you a few questions.

412
00:32:39,518 --> 00:32:44,396
Parker says he saw you coming out of your
uncle's study at 10.10. Is that right?

413
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:48,020
Do you think I am a murderer?

414
00:32:48,114 --> 00:32:50,785
Mademoiselle, if you please, just sit.

415
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:52,909
Please.

416
00:33:01,342 --> 00:33:06,386
We're just trying to place everyone in the
house, find out what they've seen or heard.

417
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:09,850
All right.

418
00:33:11,106 --> 00:33:15,058
Yes, I I did go in to say
good night to Uncle Roger.

419
00:33:15,154 --> 00:33:16,613
At ten past ten.

420
00:33:17,908 --> 00:33:19,949
I don't know.

421
00:33:21,037 --> 00:33:23,790
Yes. About then.

422
00:33:23,875 --> 00:33:25,915
Was he alone?

423
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:30,127
Alone. Yes.

424
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:33,006
Did you notice if the
window was open or shut?

425
00:33:34,223 --> 00:33:35,683
I don't know!

426
00:33:36,853 --> 00:33:38,893
I didn't look.

427
00:33:40,274 --> 00:33:42,517
Well, the curtains were drawn, anyway.

428
00:33:44,405 --> 00:33:46,446
Oh, God!

429
00:34:23,045 --> 00:34:25,086
Can I drive you home, Poirot?

430
00:34:29,514 --> 00:34:31,553
No, merci.

431
00:34:33,352 --> 00:34:35,393
I prefer to walk.

432
00:35:00,721 --> 00:35:04,103
From now on, the
deception began in earnest.

433
00:35:05,316 --> 00:35:09,102
You could scarcely move for people
protesting how innocent they were

434
00:35:09,197 --> 00:35:11,986
or pointing the finger
of guilt at someone else.

435
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:17,114
There was so much smoke, you could
hardly see across the High Street.

436
00:35:18,002 --> 00:35:20,251
Such larks!

437
00:35:32,774 --> 00:35:34,933
Oh! Hello, Flora.

438
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:39,192
I came to see Mr Poirot. Is he in?

439
00:35:39,283 --> 00:35:42,618
Well, he's terribly upset, actually.

440
00:35:42,704 --> 00:35:45,196
My brother's with him now.

441
00:35:45,291 --> 00:35:47,534
We both came round.

442
00:35:48,672 --> 00:35:51,164
Who would do a thing like
that to such a man, James?

443
00:35:51,259 --> 00:35:53,252
Well, it's difficult to say.

444
00:35:53,345 --> 00:35:55,802
The question was a
rhetorical one, mon ami.

445
00:35:58,186 --> 00:35:59,764
It's Flora.

446
00:35:59,855 --> 00:36:02,811
- Mr Poirot, I'm sorry to burst in on you.
- Mademoiselle.

447
00:36:02,901 --> 00:36:06,105
But the police think that
Ralph murdered my uncle.

448
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:08,690
He didn't do it, Mr Poirot.

449
00:36:08,785 --> 00:36:10,826
He really didn't.

450
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,456
I cannot help you, mademoiselle.

451
00:36:15,545 --> 00:36:17,752
But you're a detective.

452
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:21,590
Your uncle was Monsieur
Poirot's friend, Flora.

453
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:25,893
In any case, mademoiselle, I am
now retired. I work no longer.

454
00:36:27,103 --> 00:36:29,144
I'II I'll pay you.

455
00:36:29,231 --> 00:36:31,938
- I'll find the money somehow.
- It's not a question of money.

456
00:36:32,028 --> 00:36:34,068
Come on, old girl.

457
00:36:34,156 --> 00:36:36,066
What am I going to do?

458
00:36:37,202 --> 00:36:39,029
What am I going to do?

459
00:36:39,121 --> 00:36:41,162
Where's Ralph now?

460
00:36:42,334 --> 00:36:45,502
I don't know. Not exactly.

461
00:36:47,175 --> 00:36:50,711
Uncle Roger told me yesterday
he was staying at the White Hart.

462
00:36:50,804 --> 00:36:52,845
But he's not there now.

463
00:36:54,227 --> 00:36:56,019
He left in the middle of the night.

464
00:36:56,751 --> 00:36:59,314
But he's left all his things behind.

465
00:37:01,446 --> 00:37:03,938
- I see.
- No, you don't see!

466
00:37:05,117 --> 00:37:08,037
Ralph may have done some
foolish things in the past,

467
00:37:08,122 --> 00:37:10,661
but he wouldn't murder anyone.

468
00:37:11,369 --> 00:37:14,039
Mademoiselle, I cannot
help you as you wish.

469
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:15,330
But I

470
00:37:15,424 --> 00:37:18,380
But I will go to Inspector
Davis and speak on your behalf.

471
00:37:20,558 --> 00:37:23,346
That may do some good.

472
00:37:25,398 --> 00:37:28,935
Between us, Chief Inspector, my
money's on Ralph Paton, the stepson.

473
00:37:31,105 --> 00:37:34,286
That er foreign gentleman
to see you, Inspector.

474
00:37:34,322 --> 00:37:36,366
I don't want to be disturbed!

475
00:37:38,792 --> 00:37:41,499
I will take only five minutes
of your time, Inspector.

476
00:37:41,589 --> 00:37:43,629
I know that voice!

477
00:37:45,135 --> 00:37:47,378
Chief Inspector Japp!

478
00:37:47,471 --> 00:37:51,008
I knew the name Kings
what-do-you-call-it sounded familiar.

479
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,772
- Oh, my dear friend!
- Poirot.

480
00:38:05,165 --> 00:38:10,374
There was I, thinking you'd retired, and I
find you mixed up in murders and all sorts.

481
00:38:10,464 --> 00:38:14,049
No, no, no, Chief Inspector. I
am not, as you say, all mixed up.

482
00:38:15,137 --> 00:38:18,368
Monsieur Roger Ackroyd was my
very old friend and that is all.

483
00:38:18,405 --> 00:38:20,430
But you'll help us out, won't you?

484
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,598
Help me talk to all
these cabbage-bashers.

485
00:38:25,319 --> 00:38:27,194
Non. Non.

486
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,772
Chief Inspector, I have
been idle for too long.

487
00:38:29,867 --> 00:38:32,194
Come on, Poirot. It'll
be like old times.

488
00:38:37,963 --> 00:38:40,003
Very well.

489
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,549
But er only on the outskirts.

490
00:38:56,198 --> 00:39:01,076
Inspector Davis, MIle Ackroyd tells me
you suspect most strongly Ralph Paton.

491
00:39:01,163 --> 00:39:03,204
It was either him or the butler.

492
00:39:03,292 --> 00:39:05,250
What have we got against Paton?

493
00:39:05,336 --> 00:39:09,039
First, he left the White Hart last
night and hasn't been seen since.

494
00:39:09,134 --> 00:39:12,339
Secondly, it's said he's in
serious financial difficulties

495
00:39:12,431 --> 00:39:16,097
and will probably profit from the will.
And thirdly, he argued with Ackroyd.

496
00:39:16,185 --> 00:39:18,226
Sounds pretty fruity.

497
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:20,807
Perhaps a little too fruity, mon ami.

498
00:39:20,902 --> 00:39:22,942
We'll see about that.

499
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:25,569
I've got here a pair of
shoes from the White Hart.

500
00:39:25,658 --> 00:39:29,028
I'll compare them to the
footmarks on the window sill.

501
00:39:30,332 --> 00:39:34,283
Has anyone seen any suspicious
strangers hanging around here?

502
00:39:34,379 --> 00:39:39,257
Any strangers calling on Mr Ackroyd
at all over the last week or so?

503
00:39:39,345 --> 00:39:41,385
Yes, there was.

504
00:39:41,473 --> 00:39:45,259
That young man, called himself
a salesman. On Wednesday.

505
00:39:45,354 --> 00:39:47,312
He was in with Mr Ackroyd a good hour.

506
00:39:47,398 --> 00:39:50,520
No, no, no. That was a
perfectly innocent salesman.

507
00:39:50,612 --> 00:39:53,898
He came to the factory
trying to sell Dictaphones.

508
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:56,448
Mr Ackroyd had him come
here to demonstrate.

509
00:39:56,537 --> 00:39:58,411
Mr Tuffnell, his name was.

510
00:39:58,498 --> 00:40:02,830
Yes, all right. Now, let's get
back to the events of last night.

511
00:40:02,922 --> 00:40:06,126
There was something last
night, Chief Inspector.

512
00:40:06,218 --> 00:40:07,250
Yeah?

513
00:40:07,345 --> 00:40:12,056
I was on the terrace outside the sitting
room smoking at about 9.30. And I saw

514
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:18,403
Well, I thought I saw a woman disappearing
into the bushes near the summer house.

515
00:40:18,528 --> 00:40:20,438
Just a gleam of white, you know?

516
00:40:20,531 --> 00:40:22,192
No idea who it was?

517
00:40:23,576 --> 00:40:25,617
I'm not even sure.

518
00:40:25,705 --> 00:40:28,280
It could have been just
a trick of the moonlight.

519
00:40:28,376 --> 00:40:30,416
Yes, all right. Thank you.

520
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:36,675
Now, when you, Dr Sheppard, and
you, Parker, break the door down,

521
00:40:36,763 --> 00:40:41,059
you are confronted by the sight
of Mr Ackroyd dead in this chair.

522
00:40:41,145 --> 00:40:42,687
Quite.

523
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:48,444
- If I may, Chief Inspector?
- Of course.

524
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:49,990
Thank you.

525
00:40:50,074 --> 00:40:52,483
Is this room exactly as it was then?

526
00:40:54,497 --> 00:40:58,627
The curtains were drawn, sir.
And the electric light was on.

527
00:41:00,256 --> 00:41:02,748
Bon. Anything else?

528
00:41:06,891 --> 00:41:09,597
Yes. That chair was
drawn out a little more.

529
00:41:09,686 --> 00:41:10,932
Bon.

530
00:41:12,023 --> 00:41:13,269
Show me.

531
00:41:18,658 --> 00:41:20,698
Voila ce qui est curieux.

532
00:41:30,676 --> 00:41:32,337
How say you, Chief Inspector?

533
00:41:32,428 --> 00:41:35,430
No-one would sit in a chair
in such a position, I fancy.

534
00:41:35,516 --> 00:41:39,302
It's an odd place for it to be, all
right. But I can't see that it's important.

535
00:41:39,397 --> 00:41:41,058
It is completely unimportant.

536
00:41:41,149 --> 00:41:44,271
That is why it is so interesting.

537
00:41:44,363 --> 00:41:48,363
These shoes match the marks
on the window sill precisely.

538
00:41:48,452 --> 00:41:50,909
Of course they do, Inspector.

539
00:41:50,998 --> 00:41:53,038
Of course they do.

540
00:41:54,627 --> 00:41:59,257
For the moment, Ralph
Paton is the chief suspect.

541
00:42:00,511 --> 00:42:03,086
If muddy shoes could convict,

542
00:42:03,182 --> 00:42:06,303
they'd have him swinging from
the gallows by the morning.

543
00:42:07,314 --> 00:42:09,353
There is only one problem.

544
00:42:09,442 --> 00:42:13,523
The spineless Lothario
is nowhere to be found.

545
00:42:13,613 --> 00:42:17,150
I helped Mr Ackroyd build
this house, you know,

546
00:42:17,244 --> 00:42:19,653
design it and everything.

547
00:42:19,748 --> 00:42:21,409
These modern houses, you see,

548
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:25,121
generally, they don't have the
facilities for staff, like proper houses.

549
00:42:25,214 --> 00:42:27,753
Mr Ackroyd, he wanted it just so.

550
00:42:27,843 --> 00:42:29,422
He was a good employer, no?

551
00:42:29,512 --> 00:42:31,886
He could be short with
you, could Mr Ackroyd.

552
00:42:31,974 --> 00:42:34,015
But he was always fair.

553
00:42:35,229 --> 00:42:37,519
We shan't see his like again.

554
00:42:39,027 --> 00:42:41,067
No, indeed.

555
00:42:42,948 --> 00:42:47,031
Tell me, Monsieur Parker, what is your
opinion of the secretary, Monsieur Raymond?

556
00:42:47,121 --> 00:42:51,203
He's a bit of a stick, to tell you the
truth, Mr Poirot, but he's all right.

557
00:42:51,294 --> 00:42:54,997
It's just that he told to
Inspector Davis last night

558
00:42:55,092 --> 00:42:58,463
that he overheard Monsieur Ackroyd
talking in his study at 9.30.

559
00:42:58,555 --> 00:43:00,929
I am not disposed to believe him.

560
00:43:01,017 --> 00:43:02,810
I don't know about that, sir.

561
00:43:02,895 --> 00:43:05,517
I don't think Mr Raymond is
the type to tell an untruth.

562
00:43:05,607 --> 00:43:08,563
- Ah.
- But there is something. I mean

563
00:43:09,488 --> 00:43:11,565
I haven't mentioned it before, but

564
00:43:11,658 --> 00:43:15,195
it's been nagging away at
the back of my mind, like.

565
00:43:16,832 --> 00:43:19,751
It was usually kept in the
display case in the sitting room.

566
00:43:19,837 --> 00:43:22,293
I'm sure it was there
before dinner last night.

567
00:43:23,843 --> 00:43:25,883
Excuse me, Chief Inspector.

568
00:43:25,971 --> 00:43:29,388
Monsieur Parker would like to show
to us something. Monsieur Parker?

569
00:43:29,475 --> 00:43:30,805
It's these.

570
00:43:31,896 --> 00:43:35,064
- They came in the evening post last night.
- So what?

571
00:43:35,151 --> 00:43:37,690
Well, there were five
when I brought them in.

572
00:43:37,779 --> 00:43:39,524
And now there are four.

573
00:43:39,615 --> 00:43:43,401
I noticed particularly because these
are all business sort of letters.

574
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:46,867
And there was one more
personal one, handwritten.

575
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,915
Dark blue envelope. Quite distinctive.

576
00:43:50,006 --> 00:43:53,092
Perhaps Mr Ackroyd put it in his pocket.

577
00:43:53,178 --> 00:43:57,557
- Was any such letter discovered on the body, Inspector?
- No.

578
00:44:00,271 --> 00:44:03,024
So these are the French
windows into the sitting room.

579
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:09,533
Yes, Chief Inspector. Inside of which was
the case that contained the murderous weapon,

580
00:44:09,618 --> 00:44:12,075
- conveniently within reach.
- Mm.

581
00:44:16,629 --> 00:44:19,796
And along here, no other

582
00:44:20,927 --> 00:44:25,804
no other window overlooks the terrace till
we come to the study of Monsieur Ackroyd.

583
00:44:27,812 --> 00:44:29,604
Chief Inspector?

584
00:44:29,689 --> 00:44:31,932
I've just had a call from the GPO.

585
00:44:32,026 --> 00:44:35,314
They've traced that telephone
call that Dr Sheppard got.

586
00:44:35,407 --> 00:44:37,945
It was logged at 10.15 last night

587
00:44:38,035 --> 00:44:42,035
from a public telephone box at
Kings Abbott railway station.

588
00:44:42,125 --> 00:44:44,533
And at 10:23 the night
mail leaves for Liverpool.

589
00:44:44,628 --> 00:44:48,497
Why should the murderer telephone at all?
There seems no rhyme nor reason to it.

590
00:44:48,592 --> 00:44:51,713
Oh, there was a reason, Chief
Inspector. Of that you can be sure.

591
00:44:51,805 --> 00:44:54,927
And when we know it,
we will know everything.

592
00:45:02,154 --> 00:45:05,655
Everyone tells me it's been fine
and dry here for a fortnight.

593
00:45:05,743 --> 00:45:08,448
So how did those muddy
footprints get on the window sill?

594
00:45:08,538 --> 00:45:10,164
That is easy, Chief Inspector.

595
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:13,335
See? The gardener has
left dripping the tap.

596
00:45:13,421 --> 00:45:14,536
Oh, yeah.

597
00:45:17,218 --> 00:45:19,378
Ah, there's the same footprint again.

598
00:45:20,514 --> 00:45:22,674
You see also there the
footprint of the lady?

599
00:45:22,768 --> 00:45:25,473
Well, there's plenty
of women in the house.

600
00:45:25,563 --> 00:45:29,432
Come, Chief Inspector. Let us
investigate together the summer house.

601
00:45:41,045 --> 00:45:45,294
My Emily wanted one of these. But it
didn't seem quite right in Isleworth.

602
00:45:51,852 --> 00:45:53,893
What have you got, Poirot?

603
00:45:56,484 --> 00:45:59,736
It's a bit of cloth from a
handkerchief, or something.

604
00:46:00,907 --> 00:46:02,948
Perhaps.

605
00:46:07,918 --> 00:46:09,745
Remember this, Chief Inspector.

606
00:46:09,837 --> 00:46:14,336
The good laundry, it does
not starch the handkerchief.

607
00:46:18,517 --> 00:46:21,554
The organisation, it
is in disorder today?

608
00:46:21,646 --> 00:46:24,434
- Because of Mr Ackroyd's absence?
- Hardly.

609
00:46:24,525 --> 00:46:27,314
His guiding hand, it is not missed?

610
00:46:29,533 --> 00:46:33,948
Mr Ackroyd's guiding hand was
more likely to hold things up than.

611
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,833
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.

612
00:46:36,918 --> 00:46:40,539
But the truth is, I handled all the
day-to-day running of the business.

613
00:46:40,632 --> 00:46:42,673
Not that I got any thanks for it.

614
00:46:47,642 --> 00:46:51,891
Sundry creditors, 403 pounds

615
00:46:51,982 --> 00:46:54,938
seven shillings and four pence.

616
00:46:56,238 --> 00:47:00,534
Mr Hammond is Mr Ackroyd's personal
lawyer, as well as acting for the company.

617
00:47:01,622 --> 00:47:04,993
I'm Detective Chief Inspector
Japp of Scotland Yard.

618
00:47:06,587 --> 00:47:10,338
- And this is Hercule Poirot.
- Private detective.

619
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:13,718
We need to know what's
in Mr Ackroyd's will.

620
00:47:13,807 --> 00:47:19,395
I see. But er I shall be coming down to
the house later on anyway, for the reading.

621
00:47:19,481 --> 00:47:23,350
So much to do. Oh, so
much to do! Whenever

622
00:47:23,445 --> 00:47:25,486
Yes. What's in the will?

623
00:47:25,573 --> 00:47:29,988
Well, the will consists of a
series of legacies and bequests

624
00:47:30,081 --> 00:47:31,326
Such as?

625
00:47:31,415 --> 00:47:36,661
Well, there's ?00 to his
secretary, Mr Geoffrey Raymond.

626
00:47:37,925 --> 00:47:43,551
Then, Mrs Vera Ackroyd receives the
income from ?0,000 worth of shares,

627
00:47:43,642 --> 00:47:45,600
during her lifetime.

628
00:47:45,687 --> 00:47:51,775
While her daughter, Flora
Ackroyd, inherits ?0,000 outright.

629
00:47:51,863 --> 00:47:54,236
And the majority of the estate?

630
00:47:54,324 --> 00:47:57,660
The er residue, including Fernly Park,

631
00:47:57,746 --> 00:48:00,499
and the shares in Ackroyd Chemicals

632
00:48:00,584 --> 00:48:04,535
to his adopted son, Mr Ralph Paton.

633
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:10,179
Tell me. The estate of Monsieur
Roger Ackroyd, it was very large?

634
00:48:10,265 --> 00:48:12,258
Oh, yes, indeed.

635
00:48:12,351 --> 00:48:15,638
Mr Paton will be a
very wealthy young man.

636
00:48:16,691 --> 00:48:18,685
Merci.

637
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:23,737
Tell me, chief Inspector, the stationmaster
at Kings Abbott, was he of any help?

638
00:48:23,826 --> 00:48:28,122
Not a lot, I'm afraid. Nobody
remembers anybody using the phone box.

639
00:48:28,208 --> 00:48:32,254
But about that time, you've got the
London train coming in on one platform,

640
00:48:32,339 --> 00:48:35,044
and the Liverpool train on the other, so

641
00:48:35,134 --> 00:48:37,175
Was anyone seen to board these trains?

642
00:48:37,262 --> 00:48:41,974
Well, a porter remembers a young man
getting on the train to Liverpool.

643
00:48:42,062 --> 00:48:44,186
He thinks. Mind you.

644
00:48:46,151 --> 00:48:47,396
Voila.

645
00:48:48,738 --> 00:48:51,526
She looks pretty browned off.

646
00:48:51,617 --> 00:48:54,323
Let us go and cheer
her up, Chief Inspector.

647
00:49:03,635 --> 00:49:05,629
Bonjour, Mademoiselle Ackroyd.

648
00:49:05,721 --> 00:49:07,347
Oh, you startled me.

649
00:49:07,432 --> 00:49:09,759
There's something I've
been meaning to ask you.

650
00:49:09,853 --> 00:49:13,139
Did you go anywhere near the summer
house on the night of the murder?

651
00:49:13,232 --> 00:49:14,692
Summer house? No.

652
00:49:14,776 --> 00:49:18,361
Only someone, a lady,
was seen in its vicinity.

653
00:49:18,448 --> 00:49:20,323
Well, it wasn't me.

654
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:22,403
This would have been
about half past nine?

655
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:26,411
Thank you, mademoiselle.
You have been most helpful.

656
00:49:26,502 --> 00:49:28,745
I've got to get back
to the house, anyway.

657
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:34,630
I was just getting started with her.

658
00:49:34,723 --> 00:49:38,638
Very likely. Is she out
of sight, Chief Inspector?

659
00:49:41,566 --> 00:49:43,809
Yeah. What are you doing, Poirot?

660
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:47,651
Poirot?

661
00:49:47,742 --> 00:49:52,406
Always one must keep the
eyes on the alert, mon ami.

662
00:49:53,959 --> 00:49:58,956
One little glint in the sunlight

663
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:03,013
et voila!

664
00:50:05,059 --> 00:50:07,099
It's a wedding ring.

665
00:50:07,187 --> 00:50:09,227
Yes, indeed. Oh!

666
00:50:09,315 --> 00:50:11,474
A woman's, probably, by the size of it.

667
00:50:11,568 --> 00:50:14,025
Very likely. Do you
think this will stain?

668
00:50:14,113 --> 00:50:16,440
Funny place to find a wedding ring.

669
00:50:18,078 --> 00:50:20,914
Oh. Hang on. There's an inscription.

670
00:50:20,999 --> 00:50:24,452
From R.

671
00:50:24,546 --> 00:50:27,084
March 13th.

672
00:50:27,174 --> 00:50:29,215
Do we know who R might be?

673
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:33,221
Non.

674
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:42,894
- Ah, Mr Raymond.
- Not now, Chief Inspector.

675
00:50:47,246 --> 00:50:50,581
- What's going on, Parker?
- I don't rightly know, sir.

676
00:50:50,668 --> 00:50:53,836
Something's gone missing.

677
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:04,392
I have never thought the staff at
Fernly Park were quite trustworthy.

678
00:51:04,479 --> 00:51:06,023
What happens, madame?

679
00:51:06,107 --> 00:51:08,266
Some money is missing.

680
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:11,066
- Stolen.
- We don't know that.

681
00:51:11,156 --> 00:51:13,149
?0, Monsieur Poirot.

682
00:51:13,242 --> 00:51:15,485
From poor Roger's bedroom.

683
00:51:15,579 --> 00:51:18,784
Mr Hammond is down from
London to read the will.

684
00:51:18,876 --> 00:51:21,450
He asked Raymond if there
was cash in the house.

685
00:51:21,546 --> 00:51:23,919
It has to be included
in the estate, of course.

686
00:51:24,008 --> 00:51:28,589
When Raymond went to get it from
Mr Ackroyd's bedroom, it was gone.

687
00:51:28,682 --> 00:51:31,684
I have never thought the
staff here were trustworthy.

688
00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:33,929
Oh, come, Mrs Ackroyd.

689
00:51:34,023 --> 00:51:36,313
Right. Who's the current suspect?

690
00:51:36,401 --> 00:51:40,022
The parlour maid, Ursula. She
was given her notice yesterday.

691
00:51:40,115 --> 00:51:43,617
Doubtless she thought she'd leave
with a little unearned bonus.

692
00:51:44,664 --> 00:51:46,622
- You are Ursula Bourne?
- Yes, sir.

693
00:51:46,708 --> 00:51:49,628
- I understand you're leaving.
- Yes.

694
00:51:49,713 --> 00:51:52,205
Why is that?

695
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:57,095
I disarranged some papers
on Mr Ackroyd's desk.

696
00:51:57,182 --> 00:52:02,179
He was very angry about it
and said I had better leave.

697
00:52:02,274 --> 00:52:07,103
A considerable amount of money -
?0- is missing from this drawer.

698
00:52:07,197 --> 00:52:10,698
If you think I took it and that is why
Mr Ackroyd dismissed me, you're wrong.

699
00:52:10,786 --> 00:52:13,907
- Well, it seems
- If you please, Inspector?

700
00:52:16,794 --> 00:52:18,206
Mademoiselle Ursula,

701
00:52:18,297 --> 00:52:22,592
it was yesterday afternoon that Monsieur
Ackroyd dismissed you, was it not?

702
00:52:23,638 --> 00:52:25,881
How long did it last, this interview?

703
00:52:25,975 --> 00:52:27,220
Interview?

704
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:29,719
Between you and Monsieur
Ackroyd in the study.

705
00:52:29,814 --> 00:52:34,110
- 10 minutes? 20 minutes? Half an hour?
- Something like that.

706
00:52:34,195 --> 00:52:35,654
Half an hour?

707
00:52:35,739 --> 00:52:38,113
Well, not longer, certainly.

708
00:52:38,201 --> 00:52:40,242
Merci, mademoiselle.

709
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:46,085
Not one flipping penny! Six
years I worked for that bastard!

710
00:52:46,171 --> 00:52:47,915
Not one flipping penny.

711
00:52:48,007 --> 00:52:50,131
Well, that's what
they're like, isn't it?

712
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:55,635
Well, who do you think's
got the last laugh?

713
00:52:55,727 --> 00:52:59,596
Who knows all the little
family secrets, eh?

714
00:53:02,111 --> 00:53:04,947
Last orders, gentlemen, now, please!

715
00:53:37,330 --> 00:53:39,953
Come on! Plenty of room!

716
00:53:42,629 --> 00:53:44,208
Come on!

717
00:53:45,216 --> 00:53:48,005
Come on, you bastard!

718
00:53:48,096 --> 00:53:50,422
Plenty of room!

719
00:54:21,854 --> 00:54:26,435
First, Roger Ackroyd,
brutally stabbed in his study.

720
00:54:26,527 --> 00:54:31,441
Now his manservant Parker,
deliberately run down by a motorcar.

721
00:54:31,534 --> 00:54:33,943
Has the killer no mercy?

722
00:54:34,038 --> 00:54:38,454
No conception of the difficulty
of finding good servants?

723
00:54:38,545 --> 00:54:42,675
Our dud detectives continue
to run around in circles.

724
00:54:43,844 --> 00:54:46,218
Why would anyone want
to kill the butler?

725
00:54:46,306 --> 00:54:49,677
Perhaps he was going to
reveal to us something.

726
00:54:51,022 --> 00:54:52,516
But tell me, Chief Inspector,

727
00:54:52,607 --> 00:54:55,776
what did you think of the story
told to us by the parlour maid?

728
00:54:55,862 --> 00:54:58,022
- What story?
- The story of her dismissal.

729
00:54:58,116 --> 00:55:00,738
To dismiss a servant,
does it take half an hour?

730
00:55:00,828 --> 00:55:04,329
That was in the afternoon. It can't
have anything to do with the murder.

731
00:55:05,668 --> 00:55:07,708
I am not sure.

732
00:55:08,965 --> 00:55:12,667
Perhaps, in time, the scrap of
cambric that I found will tell us.

733
00:55:13,763 --> 00:55:15,757
You're doing what you always do, Poirot.

734
00:55:15,850 --> 00:55:18,521
- What is that, Chief Inspector?
- Confusing me.

735
00:55:18,604 --> 00:55:21,143
Just when I think I'm
getting a grip on a case.

736
00:55:25,114 --> 00:55:27,154
Tell to me, Chief Inspector

737
00:55:29,454 --> 00:55:32,325
what is your grip?
- You've got to be logical, Poirot.

738
00:55:33,376 --> 00:55:34,835
Oui, bien s?.

739
00:55:34,919 --> 00:55:37,328
All right. Now, what have we got?

740
00:55:37,424 --> 00:55:42,337
The last person to see Roger Ackroyd alive
was Dr Sheppard, who left him at nine o'clock.

741
00:55:42,431 --> 00:55:45,433
No. You forget
Mademoiselle Flora Ackroyd,

742
00:55:45,518 --> 00:55:48,438
who went in to say good night
to him at ten minutes after ten.

743
00:55:49,524 --> 00:55:50,854
Oh.

744
00:55:50,943 --> 00:55:52,984
Do not disquiet
yourself, Chief Inspector.

745
00:55:53,072 --> 00:55:55,398
I do not believe her.
Please, to continue.

746
00:55:56,284 --> 00:55:57,779
Oh. But why would she...

747
00:56:00,708 --> 00:56:05,289
Anyway, then Raymond heard Ackroyd
talking to somebody at half past nine.

748
00:56:05,382 --> 00:56:08,834
Ralph Paton disappeared from his
lodgings on the night of the murder,

749
00:56:08,928 --> 00:56:10,968
and nobody's seen him since.

750
00:56:12,183 --> 00:56:15,969
The person Ackroyd was talking
to was asking for money.

751
00:56:16,064 --> 00:56:19,019
Ralph Paton was always
in financial trouble,

752
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:21,899
and he's the chief beneficiary
of the victim's will.

753
00:56:21,989 --> 00:56:24,398
Ralph Paton had a row with the victim,

754
00:56:24,493 --> 00:56:27,246
Ralph Paton's footprints
are all over the window sill.

755
00:56:27,330 --> 00:56:29,620
So, who is the murderer, do
you think, Chief Inspector?

756
00:56:29,708 --> 00:56:33,791
Very amusing, Poirot. If Paton
were innocent, he'd come forward.

757
00:56:33,881 --> 00:56:36,041
Mais oui. That is a theory.

758
00:56:36,135 --> 00:56:38,758
Certainly you have the
little grey cells, of a kind.

759
00:56:38,848 --> 00:56:40,888
But it leaves unaccounted a great deal.

760
00:56:40,976 --> 00:56:43,302
- What, for instance?
- The chair that was moved.

761
00:56:43,396 --> 00:56:45,271
Oh, not the chair again.

762
00:56:45,357 --> 00:56:47,398
It was pulled out, it was pushed back.

763
00:56:47,485 --> 00:56:51,271
Perhaps the murderer was afraid that Monsieur
Parker would realise of its significance.

764
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:54,701
- I'm trying to deal in facts here, Poirot.
- But the chair is a fact, mon ami!

765
00:56:56,457 --> 00:56:59,910
As are the telephone call, the
wedding ring, the ?0 missing

766
00:57:00,004 --> 00:57:01,832
and the murder of Monsieur Parker.

767
00:57:01,923 --> 00:57:03,334
Why, Hercule!

768
00:57:04,594 --> 00:57:06,718
Madame Sheppard.

769
00:57:06,805 --> 00:57:09,476
Isn't it terrible about poor Parker?

770
00:57:10,936 --> 00:57:14,104
- Won't you introduce me to your friend?
- Yes, of course, madame.

771
00:57:14,191 --> 00:57:18,772
The sister of Dr Sheppard
- Chief Inspector Japp of Scotland Yard.

772
00:57:18,865 --> 00:57:21,155
I thought it must be. How exciting.

773
00:57:21,243 --> 00:57:22,654
How d'you do.

774
00:57:22,745 --> 00:57:28,204
Mind you, I don't think that Roger
Ackroyd ever knew about Parker's drinking.

775
00:57:28,295 --> 00:57:31,001
Something for you two
sleuths to think about, eh?

776
00:57:33,177 --> 00:57:35,635
- Excuse me.
- Madame.

777
00:57:35,723 --> 00:57:37,467
Bye.

778
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:39,806
Blimey!

779
00:57:41,189 --> 00:57:44,726
Decidedly, it is time for Poirot to act.

780
00:57:48,867 --> 00:57:50,908
Merci.

781
00:57:52,873 --> 00:57:55,626
Mademoiselle Ursula,
rest here, if you please.

782
00:57:59,842 --> 00:58:04,137
- Doctor, asseyez-vous
la. - Thank you.

783
00:58:09,815 --> 00:58:14,858
To begin with, I make a special
plea to you, mademoiselle.

784
00:58:14,947 --> 00:58:17,404
- To me?
- Oui.

785
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:22,118
If you know the whereabouts
of Monsieur Ralph Paton,

786
00:58:22,208 --> 00:58:25,709
I beg of you most earnestly to
persuade him to come forward.

787
00:58:25,796 --> 00:58:30,426
Monsieur Poirot, I swear solemnly to
you, I have no idea where Ralph is.

788
00:58:31,638 --> 00:58:35,175
I have neither seen him nor heard of
him on the day of the murder or since.

789
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:40,098
Bien!

790
00:58:40,747 --> 00:58:41,854
That is that!

791
00:58:43,609 --> 00:58:45,664
Now, you others,

792
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:49,284
all of you were friends and
intimates of Monsieur Ralph Paton.

793
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:52,869
If you know where the missing
man he is hiding, speak out!

794
00:58:54,672 --> 00:58:57,674
I beg of you, speak out.

795
00:58:59,137 --> 00:59:01,402
Messieurs et mesdames, I
mean to arrive at the truth.

796
00:59:01,438 --> 00:59:04,093
I mean to know, and I shall know

797
00:59:05,188 --> 00:59:07,228
in spite of you all.

798
00:59:32,895 --> 00:59:34,936
Thank you.

799
00:59:46,248 --> 00:59:48,955
- Mr?
- Poirot, Madame Folliott.

800
00:59:49,044 --> 00:59:51,085
Hercule Poirot.

801
00:59:51,173 --> 00:59:54,625
A thousand apologies for
calling on you like this.

802
00:59:54,719 --> 00:59:55,965
Not at all.

803
00:59:56,054 --> 01:00:00,553
I have seen the references that you
provided for a former parlour maid of yours,

804
01:00:00,644 --> 01:00:02,934
a Mademoiselle Ursula Bourne.

805
01:00:03,023 --> 01:00:04,269
Yes?

806
01:00:04,358 --> 01:00:08,607
And it was just over a year ago
since she left you, I understand.

807
01:00:08,698 --> 01:00:11,071
Yes. Yes, it was.

808
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:12,738
That's quite right.

809
01:00:12,829 --> 01:00:14,324
Mm.

810
01:00:14,415 --> 01:00:18,367
I was wondering if there was anything
more you can tell me about her.

811
01:00:18,463 --> 01:00:21,999
For example, she comes
from where? Her family...

812
01:00:22,092 --> 01:00:23,504
I don't know at all.

813
01:00:26,850 --> 01:00:28,344
I see.

814
01:00:28,435 --> 01:00:32,305
Then who was her employer
before she came to you?

815
01:00:32,399 --> 01:00:34,192
I really don't remember.

816
01:00:37,115 --> 01:00:39,275
Is it necessary to ask
all these questions?

817
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:42,324
Oh, no, no. Not at all, madame. Pardon.

818
01:00:43,708 --> 01:00:46,379
I did not think you
would object to answering.

819
01:00:50,969 --> 01:00:53,009
Taxi!

820
01:00:55,934 --> 01:00:59,269
- The News Chronicle in Fleet Street, s'il vous pla?.
- Yes, sir.

821
01:01:53,937 --> 01:01:56,808
All right, all right, you
can put your watch away.

822
01:01:56,899 --> 01:01:58,939
You know how lateness distresses me.

823
01:01:59,027 --> 01:02:02,196
- Mr Hammond.
- Good day to you, Chief Inspector.

824
01:02:02,282 --> 01:02:06,863
This is indeed a treat. So
much choice. I'm staggered.

825
01:02:08,458 --> 01:02:11,330
What did you discover at the
apartment of Monsieur Paton?

826
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:14,756
Absolutely nothing. A
bed, a table, a chair.

827
01:02:14,842 --> 01:02:17,169
Nobody's been there for a week.

828
01:02:18,723 --> 01:02:20,516
Did you get the list of nursing homes?

829
01:02:26,276 --> 01:02:28,316
Merci.

830
01:02:30,657 --> 01:02:35,452
There's nothing I can eat here, Poirot.
It's all macaroni this, ravioli that.

831
01:02:36,541 --> 01:02:38,202
Haven't they got any meat?

832
01:02:38,294 --> 01:02:40,999
Spaghetti Bolognese has meat.

833
01:02:41,089 --> 01:02:43,130
I don't like spaghetti.

834
01:02:45,763 --> 01:02:47,673
Now, Mr Hammond. We need your help.

835
01:02:47,765 --> 01:02:50,768
As well as acting for Mr Roger Ackroyd,

836
01:02:50,854 --> 01:02:53,975
you were also Mrs Dorothy
Ferrars' solicitor, we understand?

837
01:02:54,066 --> 01:02:57,568
That is correct. All her
affairs passed through our hands.

838
01:02:57,655 --> 01:02:59,150
You see, Monsieur Hammond,

839
01:02:59,241 --> 01:03:02,778
Monsieur Ackroyd believed that
Madame Ferrars was being blackmailed.

840
01:03:02,872 --> 01:03:08,034
And it is possible that this blackmail and
the murder of Roger Ackroyd are connected.

841
01:03:08,129 --> 01:03:11,001
Blackmail, eh?

842
01:03:11,092 --> 01:03:13,216
- You are surprised?
- No.

843
01:03:13,304 --> 01:03:16,259
No, it explains a great many things.

844
01:03:16,350 --> 01:03:20,681
During the past year, Mrs
Ferrars sold certain securities.

845
01:03:20,773 --> 01:03:24,772
But the money was paid into
her account, and not reinvested.

846
01:03:24,862 --> 01:03:28,696
I've always imagined that the
money was being paid to some woman

847
01:03:28,785 --> 01:03:31,111
who had a claim on the late Mr Ferrars.

848
01:03:31,205 --> 01:03:33,115
What was the amount of this selling?

849
01:03:33,208 --> 01:03:39,712
In all, I should say the sums
involved totalled at least ?0,000.

850
01:03:39,801 --> 01:03:44,845
?0,000? I could retire tomorrow and
go and live in the south of France.

851
01:03:44,934 --> 01:03:48,138
No. You would not approve
of the food, Chief Inspector.

852
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:52,645
None of our marry band of suspects shows any
sign of having come into that kind of money.

853
01:03:53,738 --> 01:03:57,404
Look, Poirot. There's your
old flat. Who lives there now?

854
01:03:57,494 --> 01:04:00,033
No person. It is still mine.

855
01:04:00,123 --> 01:04:02,911
No! I didn't know that.

856
01:04:03,002 --> 01:04:05,209
Well, let's go and have a look round.

857
01:04:05,297 --> 01:04:08,502
Non. In any case, I do not have my keys.

858
01:04:09,636 --> 01:04:13,718
Yes, you do. I wondered why
you wanted to walk this way.

859
01:04:13,809 --> 01:04:15,008
Come on.

860
01:04:37,177 --> 01:04:39,217
Home, sweet home, eh, Poirot?

861
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:42,134
Oui.

862
01:04:42,226 --> 01:04:44,267
But it is full of ghosts.

863
01:04:44,355 --> 01:04:46,395
Lively ones, too, some of 'em.

864
01:04:57,832 --> 01:05:00,621
You know, Chief Inspector,
this visit to London?

865
01:05:02,089 --> 01:05:04,129
It disturbs me.

866
01:05:11,895 --> 01:05:13,936
And this

867
01:05:18,363 --> 01:05:19,775
even worse.

868
01:05:22,077 --> 01:05:25,364
You were never meant to be
a country bumpkin, Poirot.

869
01:05:25,456 --> 01:05:28,127
Chief Inspector, you
must not say such things!

870
01:05:29,379 --> 01:05:31,586
The life in the country,
it is good for me.

871
01:05:32,676 --> 01:05:34,669
I have the fresh air, I have my garden

872
01:05:36,890 --> 01:05:38,088
the quiet.

873
01:05:38,183 --> 01:05:40,224
You should never have retired.

874
01:05:40,312 --> 01:05:42,435
I said so at the time, if you remember.

875
01:05:42,523 --> 01:05:46,143
One cannot postpone the inevitable
forever, Chief Inspector.

876
01:05:47,239 --> 01:05:50,574
And this case, it is
full of postponements.

877
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:53,152
- Is it?
- Ah, oui. Bien s?.

878
01:05:53,247 --> 01:05:57,793
Monsieur Roger Ackroyd and Madame Ferrars
postponed the announcement of their betrothal,

879
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:00,454
Monsieur Ralph Paton and
Mademoiselle Flora the same.

880
01:06:00,550 --> 01:06:04,301
- I don't see where that gets us.
- Non. Moi aussi.

881
01:06:06,434 --> 01:06:09,471
But one must permit oneself to muse.

882
01:06:18,534 --> 01:06:21,573
"From R, March 13th."

883
01:06:26,755 --> 01:06:30,458
Perhaps Monsieur Roger Ackroyd and
Madame Ferrars married in secret.

884
01:06:30,552 --> 01:06:32,593
Why would they do that?

885
01:06:32,681 --> 01:06:35,849
Or Ralph Paton and
Mademoiselle Flora, the same.

886
01:06:35,936 --> 01:06:39,637
Well, that's more likely.
But why keep it secret?

887
01:06:40,693 --> 01:06:43,445
Who else do we know with the initial R?

888
01:06:45,616 --> 01:06:49,367
- What about Mr Raymond?
- Monsieur Raymond? Non.

889
01:06:51,834 --> 01:06:55,335
Monsieur Raymond is not the
marrying kind, Chief Inspector.

890
01:06:55,423 --> 01:06:59,968
No. You see, we do keep
coming back to Ralph Paton.

891
01:07:01,390 --> 01:07:04,226
Of course, the ring might have
nothing to do with the case.

892
01:07:04,310 --> 01:07:07,313
But I can't understand why
he doesn't come forward.

893
01:07:07,399 --> 01:07:14,365
Has it not occurred to you, Chief Inspector,
that Monsieur Ralph Paton he could be dead?

894
01:07:14,451 --> 01:07:17,322
Dead? No.

895
01:07:18,665 --> 01:07:21,833
I hope not, for Flora
Ackroyd's sake, if nothing else.

896
01:07:23,964 --> 01:07:28,962
What did you mean when you said you didn't
believe she'd seen her uncle at ten past ten?

897
01:07:32,185 --> 01:07:35,603
Allons-y, Chief Inspector.
We must catch the train.

898
01:07:40,363 --> 01:07:44,280
I have also the need to
escape from these ghosts.

899
01:07:50,253 --> 01:07:53,838
By now, the cracks were
beginning to appear.

900
01:07:53,926 --> 01:07:56,252
There are, I am ashamed to say,

901
01:07:56,346 --> 01:08:00,476
certain darknesses of the heart
of which even I was not aware.

902
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:04,061
Who would have thought Miss
Goody-Two-Shoes Flora Ackroyd

903
01:08:04,148 --> 01:08:07,104
capable of such naughtiness?

904
01:08:07,195 --> 01:08:11,444
Monsieur Poirot has made a certain
suggestion to me, Miss Ackroyd.

905
01:08:11,535 --> 01:08:15,285
He suggests that you weren't in
the study at all last Friday night,

906
01:08:15,374 --> 01:08:18,329
and that you didn't see Mr
Ackroyd to say good night to.

907
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:20,579
Parker saw me there.

908
01:08:20,673 --> 01:08:23,925
No, mademoiselle. Monsieur Parker
said that he saw you coming out.

909
01:08:28,685 --> 01:08:32,387
You have no idea what my life
has been like since we came here.

910
01:08:35,153 --> 01:08:39,615
Wanting things, scheming
for them, lying and cheating.

911
01:08:41,162 --> 01:08:45,909
Running up bills and promising to pay
- I hate myself when I think of it all.

912
01:08:47,045 --> 01:08:50,250
That's what brought us
together, Ralph and I.

913
01:08:50,341 --> 01:08:52,715
I understood him because
I'm the same underneath.

914
01:08:52,804 --> 01:08:55,759
We're not strong enough to
stand alone, either of us.

915
01:08:59,814 --> 01:09:01,226
All right.

916
01:09:01,317 --> 01:09:04,105
I wasn't coming out of the study.

917
01:09:06,699 --> 01:09:08,740
I was in my uncle's room.

918
01:09:08,827 --> 01:09:11,402
I knew he always kept
some cash in that drawer.

919
01:09:15,253 --> 01:09:17,543
I was on the stairs

920
01:09:18,634 --> 01:09:20,758
coming down from Uncle Roger's bedroom

921
01:09:22,473 --> 01:09:24,799
when I heard Parker crossing the hall.

922
01:09:24,893 --> 01:09:28,263
So I pretended that I
was leaving the study.

923
01:09:28,356 --> 01:09:31,893
Parker. Mr Ackroyd says he
doesn't want to be disturbed.

924
01:09:31,986 --> 01:09:34,905
Oh. Very well, Miss Flora.

925
01:09:40,666 --> 01:09:44,037
- Mademoiselle
- I took it, all right? ?0!

926
01:09:44,130 --> 01:09:47,167
I'm a common, vulgar
little thief! Now you know!

927
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:57,857
Rule number one in Kings Abbott -

928
01:09:57,941 --> 01:10:00,434
never believe what anyone tells you.

929
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:04,568
So what could the sleuths
do but start again?

930
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:07,995
Back they went to Dorothy Ferrars' house

931
01:10:08,081 --> 01:10:11,836
for another rummage
through her sad existence.

932
01:10:11,872 --> 01:10:15,592
She really was the
cause of all this fuss.

933
01:10:15,593 --> 01:10:19,295
Madame Ferrars had been your
patient for many years, James.

934
01:10:20,141 --> 01:10:22,597
Had she seemed to you
recently distressed?

935
01:10:22,686 --> 01:10:28,395
She was a very sensitive person, you
know. Not many people understood her.

936
01:10:31,741 --> 01:10:34,827
But er you did.

937
01:10:34,913 --> 01:10:38,747
She confided in me to a limited extent.

938
01:10:38,835 --> 01:10:40,876
Excuse me.

939
01:10:48,850 --> 01:10:51,425
Madame Ferrars, she wrote many letters?

940
01:10:51,521 --> 01:10:53,894
No, I don't think so.

941
01:10:53,982 --> 01:10:56,937
- Her only relatives were in New Zealand.
- Oh.

942
01:11:27,574 --> 01:11:29,614
Bonjour, madame.

943
01:11:32,956 --> 01:11:34,535
Have you seen this?

944
01:11:34,625 --> 01:11:36,370
Good morning, Chief Inspector.

945
01:11:36,461 --> 01:11:38,455
What? Oh. Good morning.

946
01:11:38,548 --> 01:11:43,676
Listen. "The police have for some days
been anxious to interview Mr Ralph Paton,

947
01:11:43,764 --> 01:11:45,805
the adopted son of Mr Roger Ackroyd,

948
01:11:45,893 --> 01:11:49,428
whose death occurred in suspicious
circumstances last Friday.

949
01:11:49,522 --> 01:11:52,902
Mr Paton has now been
arrested in Liverpool,

950
01:11:52,903 --> 01:11:55,821
where he was on the point
of embarking for America."

951
01:11:55,907 --> 01:11:56,987
Bon.

952
01:11:57,075 --> 01:12:01,289
Bon? It's all rubbish. I've been onto
Liverpool. They don't know anything about it.

953
01:12:01,373 --> 01:12:02,917
No, they would not, mon ami.

954
01:12:03,001 --> 01:12:07,748
It was me who persuaded the editor of that
estimable newspaper to insert the item.

955
01:12:21,695 --> 01:12:24,318
Well, we'll see if you're right, Poirot.

956
01:12:24,407 --> 01:12:28,158
See if your newspaper article has
flushed anybody out of the woodwork.

957
01:12:28,247 --> 01:12:31,663
- Can woodwork be flushed, Chief Inspector?
- You know what I mean.

958
01:12:31,751 --> 01:12:34,956
Well, if they can be flushed,
then this will have flushed them.

959
01:12:43,727 --> 01:12:45,887
I'm sorry. Have you been waiting ages?

960
01:12:45,981 --> 01:12:47,939
We're at sixes and sevens.

961
01:12:48,025 --> 01:12:51,313
What with Parker not here,

962
01:12:51,406 --> 01:12:53,446
and Ursula not being well.

963
01:12:53,534 --> 01:12:55,574
She is unwell?

964
01:12:55,662 --> 01:12:59,114
I say unwell, but she just
won't come out of her room.

965
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:01,285
You can hear her, crying away.

966
01:13:04,508 --> 01:13:05,587
Merci.

967
01:13:21,158 --> 01:13:22,569
Go away.

968
01:13:22,659 --> 01:13:26,873
- Can we have a word, Miss Bourne?
- Go away. I don't want to see you.

969
01:13:30,922 --> 01:13:33,129
Mrs Paton?

970
01:13:33,217 --> 01:13:35,544
It is me, Hercule Poirot.

971
01:13:40,257 --> 01:13:42,726
There's no point in
pretending any more, is there?

972
01:13:44,192 --> 01:13:46,731
The paper says Ralph has been arrested.

973
01:13:46,820 --> 01:13:49,395
The truth is what we need, madame.

974
01:13:49,491 --> 01:13:51,152
Ralph didn't do it.

975
01:13:51,244 --> 01:13:56,536
I am inclined to agree with you,
but the affair marches badly.

976
01:13:57,795 --> 01:14:01,130
Only the truth can
save Monsieur Paton now.

977
01:14:02,468 --> 01:14:07,216
So first, tell to us why you make
this masquerade as a parlour maid?

978
01:14:07,309 --> 01:14:09,350
For a living.

979
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:14,432
My father died two years ago,
leaving nothing but debts.

980
01:14:14,528 --> 01:14:16,771
Debts and five daughters.

981
01:14:17,866 --> 01:14:21,616
My eldest sister was already
married to a Captain Folliott.

982
01:14:21,705 --> 01:14:24,661
Oui. I met your sister yesterday.

983
01:14:24,751 --> 01:14:27,125
I wasn't going to be
a Lady parlour maid.

984
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:29,254
It was the real thing or nothing.

985
01:14:29,341 --> 01:14:31,833
And my sister would give me a reference.

986
01:14:31,928 --> 01:14:35,180
- So you got a job here.
- Yes.

987
01:14:35,267 --> 01:14:37,806
Actually, I quite enjoyed the work.

988
01:14:37,895 --> 01:14:40,019
And I met Ralph.

989
01:14:40,107 --> 01:14:42,564
As soon as we met,
we both felt the same.

990
01:14:42,652 --> 01:14:44,895
We wanted to get married.

991
01:14:44,989 --> 01:14:47,029
Oui.

992
01:14:48,161 --> 01:14:51,448
On the 13th of March.

993
01:14:54,295 --> 01:14:56,123
My ring!

994
01:14:57,549 --> 01:14:59,626
I thought I'd lost it for ever.

995
01:14:59,719 --> 01:15:02,675
- How? Where did you
- Please to continue, madame.

996
01:15:04,226 --> 01:15:07,228
Well, we um

997
01:15:07,314 --> 01:15:10,899
we got married and then I came back here

998
01:15:10,986 --> 01:15:13,312
and Ralph stayed in
London looking for work.

999
01:15:14,407 --> 01:15:19,867
But then he decided that the only way to
clear his debts was to ask Mr Ackroyd for help.

1000
01:15:19,958 --> 01:15:22,366
Still without disclosing
to him your marriage.

1001
01:15:22,461 --> 01:15:26,046
Yes. Mr Ackroyd was furious.

1002
01:15:26,133 --> 01:15:29,635
But he said he'd help if
Ralph married Flora Ackroyd.

1003
01:15:29,722 --> 01:15:31,098
And he agreed?

1004
01:15:31,182 --> 01:15:35,229
Yes. But he did make the stipulation that
it shouldn't be announced for a while.

1005
01:15:36,399 --> 01:15:38,439
He didn't want me to hear about it.

1006
01:15:38,527 --> 01:15:39,987
I bet he didn't.

1007
01:15:40,071 --> 01:15:43,108
But then, last Thursday,
Mr Ackroyd got impatient

1008
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:46,488
and said the engagement had
to be announced that weekend.

1009
01:15:47,623 --> 01:15:50,745
So Ralph had to tell
me the mess he was in.

1010
01:15:50,837 --> 01:15:53,210
It's on the cards he'll
cut me off with a shilling.

1011
01:15:53,299 --> 01:15:57,085
I said I would see Mr Ackroyd
and tell him we were married.

1012
01:15:57,179 --> 01:16:00,715
Ralph begged me not to,
but what else was I to do?

1013
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:05,559
I was so furious with Ralph

1014
01:16:05,650 --> 01:16:08,273
that on my way home, I
threw away my wedding ring.

1015
01:16:08,362 --> 01:16:11,733
I regretted it almost as
soon as I'd done it, but

1016
01:16:12,869 --> 01:16:18,625
I thought Mr Ackroyd might be
sympathetic, but he was awful.

1017
01:16:18,711 --> 01:16:21,666
He said I'd tried to
trap Ralph for his money.

1018
01:16:21,757 --> 01:16:23,549
Already married?

1019
01:16:23,635 --> 01:16:27,800
Anyway, I'd agreed to meet
Ralph in the summer house

1020
01:16:27,891 --> 01:16:29,552
to tell him how it had gone.

1021
01:16:30,646 --> 01:16:33,564
I met him at 9.30 and that was awful.

1022
01:16:33,650 --> 01:16:37,649
- You've ruined everything!
- I have every right. I'm your wife!

1023
01:16:40,117 --> 01:16:43,987
You also tore your apron.

1024
01:16:44,082 --> 01:16:46,324
I wondered where I'd done that.

1025
01:16:48,254 --> 01:16:53,417
Anyway, I I haven't heard
or seen of Ralph since.

1026
01:16:55,014 --> 01:16:57,767
And then I heard that Mr
Ackroyd had been murdered.

1027
01:16:59,729 --> 01:17:01,308
Oui.

1028
01:17:02,526 --> 01:17:08,281
Tell us, Madame Paton, what hour was it that
you parted from your husband in the summerhouse?

1029
01:17:09,494 --> 01:17:11,951
I've gone over that again and again.

1030
01:17:12,039 --> 01:17:16,039
I was with Ralph for
10 minutes? Not longer.

1031
01:17:16,897 --> 01:17:20,508
It was just quarter to ten
when I got back to the house.

1032
01:17:25,893 --> 01:17:27,852
Ah, there you are, Monsieur Poirot.

1033
01:17:27,938 --> 01:17:31,142
I was just trying to find you.
There's a phone call for you.

1034
01:17:31,234 --> 01:17:33,275
- For me?
- Yes.

1035
01:17:40,623 --> 01:17:42,664
Poirot.

1036
01:17:59,401 --> 01:18:01,442
Ah.

1037
01:18:01,529 --> 01:18:03,570
Mr Smith.

1038
01:18:04,992 --> 01:18:07,033
I thought that I would find you here.

1039
01:18:13,755 --> 01:18:16,248
So now will come the biggest test.

1040
01:18:16,343 --> 01:18:18,917
We have all been summoned to a pow-wow.

1041
01:18:19,013 --> 01:18:21,932
But I am sure the police
are still in the dark.

1042
01:18:22,017 --> 01:18:26,432
If we all hold our nerve, they
won't get any more secrets out of us.

1043
01:18:26,524 --> 01:18:29,729
But there is always a
weak link, isn't there?

1044
01:18:29,821 --> 01:18:33,073
No, no, no, no, no, no, Caroline!

1045
01:18:33,159 --> 01:18:36,031
I won't pander to your
mere inquisitiveness.

1046
01:18:36,122 --> 01:18:38,495
Oh, come on, James. Don't be a meanie.

1047
01:18:38,583 --> 01:18:43,046
No, Caroline! Poirot said
just those people he named.

1048
01:18:43,132 --> 01:18:46,004
Well, I'll just drive
you up there. That's all.

1049
01:18:46,095 --> 01:18:48,504
Hercule won't mind. I
don't have to come in.

1050
01:19:11,340 --> 01:19:15,007
Well! I don't see why we have
to be at his beck and call.

1051
01:19:35,793 --> 01:19:39,627
Ah, Chief Inspector. You are so
kind. Please to place it here.

1052
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:43,503
No, no, no, no.

1053
01:19:43,596 --> 01:19:45,969
Voila. Observe.

1054
01:19:47,143 --> 01:19:50,727
Ah, come in, please. All of you.
It is so good of you to come.

1055
01:19:50,815 --> 01:19:54,684
Please, entrez, entrez.
Make yourselves comfortable.

1056
01:19:54,779 --> 01:19:57,318
Monsieur Raymond, if
you please, to remain.

1057
01:19:57,409 --> 01:19:58,819
- Oh. Me, too?
- Oui.

1058
01:19:58,910 --> 01:20:02,577
What's the great idea?
Some scientific machine?

1059
01:20:02,666 --> 01:20:06,167
Do we have electrodes on our
knees to register guilty knocking?

1060
01:20:06,255 --> 01:20:10,420
No, Monsieur Raymond. I am old-fashioned.
I work only with my little grey cells.

1061
01:20:10,511 --> 01:20:12,551
Please to sit.

1062
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:17,018
Ah, my dear, good Dr James.
Welcome to you. Please, do sit.

1063
01:20:21,986 --> 01:20:25,986
- You know, of course, Chief Inspector Japp.
- Good evening.

1064
01:20:26,075 --> 01:20:27,903
Bon. So

1065
01:20:27,995 --> 01:20:30,072
now let us begin.

1066
01:20:30,165 --> 01:20:33,120
But first, I have an
announcement to make.

1067
01:20:34,755 --> 01:20:37,163
This young lady,

1068
01:20:37,258 --> 01:20:39,382
Mademoiselle Ursula Bourne,

1069
01:20:39,470 --> 01:20:43,683
is in reality Madame Ralph Paton.

1070
01:20:43,769 --> 01:20:47,850
Oh, yes. She married
Ralph Paton last March.

1071
01:20:47,940 --> 01:20:51,691
Ralph? Married?

1072
01:20:52,823 --> 01:20:56,359
- How could he be?
- Oh, shut up, Mother!

1073
01:21:00,125 --> 01:21:02,797
You and Ralph kept
your secret very well.

1074
01:21:05,592 --> 01:21:07,633
I'm very glad for you.

1075
01:21:09,765 --> 01:21:11,640
Well, that's very kind.

1076
01:21:11,726 --> 01:21:14,681
Ralph behaved so badly,
especially to you.

1077
01:21:15,982 --> 01:21:18,439
He was in a corner and
took the only way out.

1078
01:21:19,362 --> 01:21:22,281
I'd have probably done the
same myself, in his place.

1079
01:21:42,604 --> 01:21:48,194
Each person here had both the motive and
opportunity to kill Monsieur Roger Ackroyd

1080
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:51,401
and, because he knew too
much, Monsieur Parker.

1081
01:21:53,203 --> 01:21:59,327
Madame Ralph Paton might well have
hoped to clarify her own situation

1082
01:22:00,423 --> 01:22:05,881
if the uncle of Mademoiselle Flora did not
exert pressure on her to marry Ralph Paton.

1083
01:22:06,974 --> 01:22:11,519
Monsieur Raymond resented the
unwillingness of Monsieur Roger Ackroyd

1084
01:22:11,606 --> 01:22:14,014
to grant him more
authority in the factory.

1085
01:22:14,109 --> 01:22:18,025
And, of course, Madame
Ackroyd and Mademoiselle Flora

1086
01:22:18,115 --> 01:22:20,786
both hoped to profit from
the will of Monsieur Ackroyd.

1087
01:22:23,457 --> 01:22:25,497
I don't like this.

1088
01:22:25,585 --> 01:22:27,626
I'd much prefer to go home.

1089
01:22:27,713 --> 01:22:31,380
You cannot, madame, until you
have heard what Poirot has to say.

1090
01:22:31,469 --> 01:22:33,509
Please to sit.

1091
01:22:37,352 --> 01:22:39,392
Merci, madame.

1092
01:22:40,732 --> 01:22:44,566
The problem has always been one of time.

1093
01:22:45,864 --> 01:22:49,484
We know that Monsieur Roger
Ackroyd was alive at half past nine,

1094
01:22:49,578 --> 01:22:52,866
because that was when Monsieur
Raymond overheard him talking.

1095
01:22:52,959 --> 01:22:55,581
But with whom was he talking?

1096
01:22:56,965 --> 01:22:59,587
Certainly, it was not
Monsieur Ralph Paton,

1097
01:22:59,677 --> 01:23:03,759
whom we know was at the time in
the summer house with his wife.

1098
01:23:03,850 --> 01:23:06,389
So, with whom?

1099
01:23:06,478 --> 01:23:10,395
From the very beginning of this case,
I have been troubled by one thing

1100
01:23:10,484 --> 01:23:14,484
the nature of those words
spoken by Monsieur Roger Ackroyd,

1101
01:23:14,574 --> 01:23:16,401
overheard by Monsieur Raymond.

1102
01:23:16,493 --> 01:23:20,279
"The calls on my purse have
been so frequent of late

1103
01:23:21,709 --> 01:23:27,216
that it is impossible for me
to accede to your request."

1104
01:23:29,387 --> 01:23:32,924
Eh bien. Does nothing
odd strike you about that?

1105
01:23:33,018 --> 01:23:36,138
It sounds more as if
he's dictating a letter.

1106
01:23:36,230 --> 01:23:38,354
Exactement.

1107
01:23:39,485 --> 01:23:41,728
A Dictaphone. Is that what you think?

1108
01:23:41,822 --> 01:23:44,610
But it doesn't change anything.

1109
01:23:44,701 --> 01:23:47,158
Mr Ackroyd was alive at 9.30,

1110
01:23:47,246 --> 01:23:49,323
since he was speaking
into his Dictaphone.

1111
01:24:02,144 --> 01:24:04,932
But always we come back
to Monsieur Ralph Paton.

1112
01:24:06,984 --> 01:24:08,610
As I have said,

1113
01:24:08,695 --> 01:24:13,276
we know that he was in the
summer house with Madame Paton.

1114
01:24:13,369 --> 01:24:16,406
But then suddenly, pouf! He disappears.

1115
01:24:17,458 --> 01:24:22,205
Where? He has fled the country, perhaps?

1116
01:24:22,298 --> 01:24:27,972
Or perhaps he has become the
third victim of our murderer.

1117
01:24:28,057 --> 01:24:29,220
No!

1118
01:24:29,308 --> 01:24:34,769
Or perhaps someone is helping him
to conceal himself from the police.

1119
01:24:34,805 --> 01:24:37,483
But who and where?

1120
01:24:37,571 --> 01:24:40,609
A hotel? Non.

1121
01:24:40,701 --> 01:24:42,445
Far too public.

1122
01:24:42,537 --> 01:24:45,788
A boarding house? No, no. The same.

1123
01:24:45,875 --> 01:24:47,915
I have it.

1124
01:24:48,838 --> 01:24:51,128
The private nursing home.

1125
01:24:51,216 --> 01:24:54,752
Chief Inspector Japp made enquiries

1126
01:24:54,847 --> 01:24:59,178
and discovered that there were
in the area two nursing homes.

1127
01:24:59,270 --> 01:25:03,733
And at one of them, there had been
admitted early on Saturday morning a certain

1128
01:25:04,903 --> 01:25:06,564
Mr Smith.

1129
01:25:06,655 --> 01:25:08,696
But Ralph would never run away!

1130
01:25:10,077 --> 01:25:14,373
We can ask Mr Smith himself.

1131
01:25:18,882 --> 01:25:20,163
Oh, Ralph!

1132
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:25,721
But I ask myself,

1133
01:25:25,808 --> 01:25:30,389
I wonder who it is who gave
authority to the nursing home

1134
01:25:30,482 --> 01:25:33,983
for the admission of
Monsieur Ralph Paton?

1135
01:25:36,407 --> 01:25:38,484
All right, Poirot.

1136
01:25:38,577 --> 01:25:41,746
Mea culpa.

1137
01:25:41,832 --> 01:25:45,702
As soon as I heard that Ralph
was back in Kings Abbott,

1138
01:25:45,797 --> 01:25:48,964
and staying at the White Hart,
I knew something must be wrong.

1139
01:25:49,051 --> 01:25:51,673
I went to see him that afternoon.

1140
01:25:51,763 --> 01:25:56,060
Eventually, he told me about his
marriage and the hole he was in.

1141
01:25:56,145 --> 01:25:59,765
There didn't seem to be anything
I could do to help at the time,

1142
01:25:59,858 --> 01:26:02,897
but that night, when the
murder was discovered,

1143
01:26:02,989 --> 01:26:06,406
I knew that suspicion would fall on him.

1144
01:26:06,493 --> 01:26:08,784
Or, if not on him, on the girl he loved.

1145
01:26:09,832 --> 01:26:15,754
And the thought of his possibly having to
give evidence that might incriminate his wife

1146
01:26:15,841 --> 01:26:19,793
My dear James, have I
not told to you 36 times,

1147
01:26:19,888 --> 01:26:23,674
it is impossible to conceal
anything from Hercule Poirot?

1148
01:26:43,798 --> 01:26:47,549
I know precisely who murdered Monsieur
Roger Ackroyd and Monsieur Parker

1149
01:26:47,638 --> 01:26:49,678
and how it was done.

1150
01:26:51,185 --> 01:26:53,225
And this

1151
01:26:54,356 --> 01:26:56,645
tells to me all.

1152
01:26:57,611 --> 01:26:59,521
What is it?

1153
01:27:00,615 --> 01:27:03,071
It is a wireless message from a steamer

1154
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:05,617
on her way to the United States.

1155
01:27:07,667 --> 01:27:12,378
And tomorrow, the good
Chief Inspector Japp

1156
01:27:13,842 --> 01:27:16,300
will make his arrest.

1157
01:27:27,029 --> 01:27:28,488
What a ridiculous exercise!

1158
01:27:28,572 --> 01:27:32,952
I have never seen anything more
pointless in my entire life!

1159
01:27:33,037 --> 01:27:35,078
That wretched little man! Really!

1160
01:28:09,884 --> 01:28:11,296
Now, look here, Poirot.

1161
01:28:11,386 --> 01:28:13,594
If you really know who
committed this murder...

1162
01:28:13,681 --> 01:28:16,007
Both of the murders, Chief Inspector.

1163
01:28:17,896 --> 01:28:19,307
Yes, I do.

1164
01:28:30,790 --> 01:28:34,041
- Well, who is it?
- Can you tell us?

1165
01:28:36,924 --> 01:28:39,630
Poirot shall not make
things easy for you.

1166
01:28:39,719 --> 01:28:43,286
You, Chief Inspector, with your career
of detection both long and distinguished,

1167
01:28:43,323 --> 01:28:46,687
you have your theories, I
know. And you, my dear James,

1168
01:28:46,771 --> 01:28:50,272
you have been involved in the case
from the beginning, n'est-ce pas?

1169
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:53,113
You know intimately all
of the people involved,

1170
01:28:53,197 --> 01:28:55,191
as only the good country doctor can.

1171
01:28:55,283 --> 01:28:59,200
But, before I reveal my secret,

1172
01:28:59,289 --> 01:29:03,040
you must both expound
your theories to me.

1173
01:29:04,339 --> 01:29:08,203
And let us commence with you, James.

1174
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:10,555
Me? Oh, no.

1175
01:29:11,558 --> 01:29:15,095
I can't show myself up in
front of the professionals.

1176
01:29:18,067 --> 01:29:21,818
I got so fed up with waiting in the car.
Are you going to be much longer, James?

1177
01:29:21,906 --> 01:29:26,442
- No, no. Maybe I ought to call it a day.
- No, my dear James.

1178
01:29:26,479 --> 01:29:30,575
Madame, your brother was just going to
tell us his theories about the murderer.

1179
01:29:30,669 --> 01:29:33,244
Please to come and sit.

1180
01:29:34,759 --> 01:29:36,799
Yes.

1181
01:29:38,931 --> 01:29:40,972
Yes, of course.

1182
01:29:42,187 --> 01:29:47,396
Merci. So, James, tell us, what sort
of man or woman are we looking for?

1183
01:29:47,486 --> 01:29:51,106
Woman? I hardly think
it could be a woman.

1184
01:29:52,284 --> 01:29:56,664
And this man, was he also,
do you think, the blackmailer?

1185
01:29:58,168 --> 01:30:04,624
Oh, I think he probably had some sort of
financial arrangement with Mrs Ferrars, yes.

1186
01:30:05,680 --> 01:30:10,390
Somehow, certainly, he became aware of
the true cause of Ashley Ferrars' death.

1187
01:30:10,478 --> 01:30:14,181
He could even be a detective.

1188
01:30:19,449 --> 01:30:24,114
But perhaps, as a doctor, you would have
been also situated most ideally, n'est-ce pas?

1189
01:30:24,207 --> 01:30:26,497
Oh, ideally.

1190
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:30,250
But the important moment in this case

1191
01:30:30,341 --> 01:30:33,129
is not the murder of Ashley Ferrars,

1192
01:30:33,220 --> 01:30:35,677
but the suicide of his widow.

1193
01:30:35,765 --> 01:30:39,682
Her motives remain unclear,
but, for whatever reason,

1194
01:30:39,771 --> 01:30:43,356
she decided to end her life.

1195
01:30:43,444 --> 01:30:49,567
Now, this must have placed our
murderer in something of a quandary.

1196
01:30:49,661 --> 01:30:55,536
He knew about her rather distasteful
affair with Roger Ackroyd.

1197
01:30:55,628 --> 01:31:00,043
His difficulty was in knowing
whether, before she died,

1198
01:31:00,135 --> 01:31:04,550
she had confided in him
the identity of the man

1199
01:31:04,641 --> 01:31:07,312
with whom she had the
financial arrangement.

1200
01:31:07,395 --> 01:31:08,511
The blackmailer.

1201
01:31:08,606 --> 01:31:12,937
This was hardly some common
blackmailer, Chief Inspector.

1202
01:31:13,029 --> 01:31:19,070
He probably saw Roger Ackroyd
somewhere about this time

1203
01:31:19,163 --> 01:31:24,242
and something in Ackroyd's
manner made him wonder.

1204
01:31:24,337 --> 01:31:26,876
And, in that moment,

1205
01:31:26,965 --> 01:31:30,502
he decided he could not take a chance.

1206
01:31:31,681 --> 01:31:35,001
He was certainly capable of
constructing some sort of device

1207
01:31:35,038 --> 01:31:39,399
to turn a Dictaphone on and
off at any time he chose.

1208
01:31:40,778 --> 01:31:46,285
I don't imagine he'd left the choice of
weapon as much to chance as it would appear.

1209
01:31:47,287 --> 01:31:50,373
I believe he had a
weapon with him already

1210
01:31:51,502 --> 01:31:54,434
when it occurred to him that the dagger,

1211
01:31:54,470 --> 01:31:59,354
which was actually on display
at the scene of the crime,

1212
01:31:59,391 --> 01:32:03,467
would cast the net of
suspicion even wider.

1213
01:32:04,730 --> 01:32:07,138
He was all ready to perform the killing,

1214
01:32:07,953 --> 01:32:12,278
when he had confirmation
of his deepest fear.

1215
01:32:12,366 --> 01:32:14,276
The evening post, sir.

1216
01:32:14,369 --> 01:32:19,163
Mrs Ferrars had indeed
confided in Ackroyd,

1217
01:32:19,251 --> 01:32:23,962
but not in person
- she had written him a letter.

1218
01:32:25,051 --> 01:32:31,472
And Ackroyd opened that letter in
his presence and started to read it.

1219
01:32:32,395 --> 01:32:35,600
"My dear, my very dear Roger,

1220
01:32:35,692 --> 01:32:39,110
I would not tell you
the name this afternoon

1221
01:32:40,199 --> 01:32:42,821
but I propose to write it to you now."

1222
01:32:45,290 --> 01:32:48,375
I'm sorry, but I I must
read this on my own.

1223
01:32:49,378 --> 01:32:51,871
At least tell me the name of the man.

1224
01:32:51,966 --> 01:32:54,921
- No, no. I must read it on my own.
- Very well.

1225
01:33:03,942 --> 01:33:08,356
And in that letter, Madame Ferrars
had named the blackmailer, had she not?

1226
01:33:08,448 --> 01:33:12,282
I've been reading this book
I found in the car, James.

1227
01:33:12,371 --> 01:33:14,115
It wasn't blackmail!

1228
01:33:14,207 --> 01:33:16,117
Don't say any more, James.

1229
01:33:16,210 --> 01:33:20,257
Oh, come now, James. The man
had bled Madame Ferrars white!

1230
01:33:20,341 --> 01:33:25,301
Dorothy Ferrars was an
adulterous, murdering bitch!

1231
01:33:25,391 --> 01:33:28,428
She lorded it over us.

1232
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:32,769
All the money she had
- she never worked for it. Nor did her drunk of a husband before her.

1233
01:33:32,860 --> 01:33:35,897
- They were idle, useless parasites.
- Stop it, James.

1234
01:33:35,990 --> 01:33:37,152
No!

1235
01:33:37,241 --> 01:33:39,255
They didn't know what it was
like scrimping and saving,

1236
01:33:39,292 --> 01:33:42,156
year after year, never
able to afford a holiday,

1237
01:33:42,249 --> 01:33:47,494
on call day and night to every idiot
with a bilious attack for miles around.

1238
01:33:48,507 --> 01:33:51,546
You've no right to
stand in judgment on me.

1239
01:33:51,637 --> 01:33:54,343
Blackmail, you call it? Blackmail?

1240
01:33:54,433 --> 01:33:58,515
The law wouldn't punish
her, would they? So I did.

1241
01:34:06,701 --> 01:34:10,072
Well there you are.

1242
01:34:12,835 --> 01:34:14,876
I've done your work for you.

1243
01:34:20,722 --> 01:34:23,012
Sorry, Caro.

1244
01:34:25,354 --> 01:34:28,521
Killing Ackroyd was easy.

1245
01:34:31,488 --> 01:34:35,701
The knife was sharp and I
knew just where to strike.

1246
01:34:42,879 --> 01:34:47,627
And for the rest, I simply
had to follow my plan.

1247
01:34:49,222 --> 01:34:54,931
The first thing to do was make sure
everyone remembered me leaving the house.

1248
01:34:55,022 --> 01:34:57,693
- I'll just go and say good night to the ladies.
- Yes, sir.

1249
01:35:00,656 --> 01:35:05,534
I drove away, but parked the
car a little way down the drive.

1250
01:35:06,874 --> 01:35:12,961
Then I had to make it look as if Ralph
Paton had entered through the window.

1251
01:35:14,050 --> 01:35:18,097
He was a pathetic, profligate fellow.

1252
01:35:19,266 --> 01:35:23,182
I knew Ackroyd had bought a
Dictaphone and had been using it.

1253
01:35:24,274 --> 01:35:29,983
Now I was going to use it, to arrange
for Ackroyd to speak from the grave.

1254
01:35:34,038 --> 01:35:38,501
And then, the business of the
chair, which so intrigued you all.

1255
01:35:48,684 --> 01:35:53,978
I'd left Ralph Paton's muddy shoe
outside when I entered through the window.

1256
01:35:54,068 --> 01:35:56,607
Now, as I made my escape,

1257
01:35:56,696 --> 01:36:00,281
I was able to use it to
make a footprint on the sill.

1258
01:36:05,877 --> 01:36:09,923
And then, of course, the
Dictaphone did its work.

1259
01:36:13,513 --> 01:36:17,050
"I'm greatly impressed by your
persistence and determination,

1260
01:36:17,143 --> 01:36:21,772
however, I regret to say that the calls
on my purse have been so frequent of late"

1261
01:36:21,859 --> 01:36:27,152
Which convinces us that Monsieur
Roger Ackroyd was alive at 9.30,

1262
01:36:27,242 --> 01:36:30,943
by which time you were
safely back at home awaiting

1263
01:36:31,039 --> 01:36:32,035
Hello, Dr Sheppard.

1264
01:36:32,124 --> 01:36:34,164
The telephone call.

1265
01:36:35,254 --> 01:36:38,042
From the patient whom you
had persuaded to take part

1266
01:36:38,133 --> 01:36:42,713
in what you had told
him was a practical joke.

1267
01:36:43,766 --> 01:36:47,136
Yes. You did well there, Poirot.

1268
01:36:48,273 --> 01:36:50,462
I was quite surprised

1269
01:36:50,498 --> 01:36:53,772
when you showed us your
telegram from the ocean liner.

1270
01:36:53,864 --> 01:36:55,904
Well done.

1271
01:36:57,953 --> 01:36:59,994
Thank you.

1272
01:37:01,167 --> 01:37:03,410
I needed the excuse of his phone call

1273
01:37:03,503 --> 01:37:08,713
to ensure that I was the first on the
scene when the murder was discovered.

1274
01:37:08,802 --> 01:37:11,276
- Police, sir?
- What's the matter with you, Parker?

1275
01:37:11,277 --> 01:37:14,726
- Your master has been murdered.
- Murdered, sir?

1276
01:37:17,650 --> 01:37:21,732
No. The fewer people disturb
this room, the better.

1277
01:37:23,867 --> 01:37:28,033
I'd carefully calculated
the position of the chair

1278
01:37:28,123 --> 01:37:32,918
so that the Dictaphone would be hidden
from anyone standing in the doorway.

1279
01:37:33,923 --> 01:37:36,130
Ring the police station, Parker.

1280
01:37:36,218 --> 01:37:40,134
When I'd sent Parker to
telephone for the police,

1281
01:37:40,224 --> 01:37:43,761
I had ample time to
remove my contrivance

1282
01:37:43,854 --> 01:37:48,150
and put the chair back
in its accustomed place.

1283
01:37:53,327 --> 01:37:58,537
Finally, I had to tell Ralph
Paton of his uncle's murder,

1284
01:37:58,626 --> 01:38:00,916
persuade him that he was in danger

1285
01:38:01,005 --> 01:38:05,135
and get him to accompany
me to the nursing home.

1286
01:38:06,471 --> 01:38:08,382
Why did you kill Parker?

1287
01:38:08,474 --> 01:38:10,515
Parker was too observant.

1288
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:15,057
He remembered bringing
five letters, not four,

1289
01:38:15,151 --> 01:38:18,022
and that one of them was
handwritten on dark-blue paper.

1290
01:38:19,157 --> 01:38:21,197
He knew he hadn't moved the chair.

1291
01:38:21,285 --> 01:38:24,987
How long would it be
before he realised I had?

1292
01:38:27,210 --> 01:38:30,378
No. I couldn't take that chance.

1293
01:38:31,717 --> 01:38:34,505
James, your journal.

1294
01:38:45,447 --> 01:38:50,029
James Sheppard, I am arresting you
for the murder of Roger Ackroyd.

1295
01:38:50,954 --> 01:38:53,243
Of course you are, Chief Inspector.

1296
01:38:54,221 --> 01:38:56,709
James, no. This is foolish!

1297
01:38:56,796 --> 01:38:59,370
Don't move, either of you.

1298
01:39:23,126 --> 01:39:25,036
Are you all right, Chief Inspector?

1299
01:39:26,381 --> 01:39:27,544
Stop!

1300
01:39:28,467 --> 01:39:30,461
Come on, Poirot.

1301
01:39:48,246 --> 01:39:50,039
Japp!

1302
01:40:00,598 --> 01:40:02,010
That's three.

1303
01:40:31,393 --> 01:40:32,888
Get back, Poirot!

1304
01:40:33,897 --> 01:40:35,142
James, no!

1305
01:40:35,232 --> 01:40:36,810
Don't make me, then!

1306
01:40:39,446 --> 01:40:42,069
Plenty of time for heroics
when he runs out of ammo.

1307
01:40:46,248 --> 01:40:48,288
That's five. One more to go.

1308
01:41:12,620 --> 01:41:13,616
No!

1309
01:41:13,705 --> 01:41:15,663
James!

1310
01:41:44,701 --> 01:41:47,910
For the sake of the
sister of Dr Sheppard,

1311
01:41:48,006 --> 01:41:53,299
the true stories of these murders
must, for the moment, remain a secret.

1312
01:41:57,395 --> 01:42:00,979
A last favour, if you will, to a
man I once looked on as a friend.

1313
01:42:04,238 --> 01:42:08,701
I thought I could escape the wickedness
of the city, by moving to the country.

1314
01:42:10,163 --> 01:42:13,914
The fields that are green,
the singing of the birds,

1315
01:42:14,002 --> 01:42:17,124
the faces, smiling and friendly.

1316
01:42:17,216 --> 01:42:18,544
Huh!

1317
01:42:19,511 --> 01:42:20,974
The fields that are green

1318
01:42:21,010 --> 01:42:25,346
are the secret burial places of
the victims of murders most hideous.

1319
01:42:25,436 --> 01:42:29,518
The birds sing only briefly before
some idiot in tweeds shoots them.

1320
01:42:30,610 --> 01:42:33,696
And the faces all smiling and friendly

1321
01:42:34,950 --> 01:42:36,991
what do they conceal?

1322
01:42:44,744 --> 01:42:48,560
