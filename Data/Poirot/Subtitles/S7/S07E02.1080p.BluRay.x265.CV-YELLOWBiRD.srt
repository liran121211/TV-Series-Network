1
00:00:19,231 --> 00:00:24,605
Go, get some water
and wash this filthy witness from your hand.

2
00:00:25,737 --> 00:00:28,488
Why did you bring these daggers
from the place?

3
00:00:28,573 --> 00:00:29,818
They must lie there.

4
00:00:29,907 --> 00:00:33,525
Go, carry them, and smear
the sleepy grooms with blood.

5
00:00:33,619 --> 00:00:36,027
I'll go no more.

6
00:00:37,456 --> 00:00:40,243
I am afraid to think what I have done.

7
00:00:41,752 --> 00:00:43,578
Give me the daggers.

8
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:48,047
The sleeping and the dead
are but as pictures.

9
00:00:48,133 --> 00:00:52,628
'Tis the eye of childhood
That fears a painted devil.

10
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,219
If he do bleed,

11
00:00:57,224 --> 00:01:01,518
I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal,

12
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,762
for it must seem their guilt.

13
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,027
Father!

14
00:01:20,037 --> 00:01:22,160
How could you do it?

15
00:01:22,247 --> 00:01:25,698
How could you embarrass me on my
first night in front of all those people?

16
00:01:25,792 --> 00:01:28,413
Embarrassed?
Who was embarrassed?

17
00:01:28,503 --> 00:01:32,453
I was the one who had to sit there and watch
my wife cavorting in the arms of another man.

18
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:35,039
It's a play, George.
It's William Shakespeare.

19
00:01:35,134 --> 00:01:38,799
It's nothing but an excuse,
an excuse for bestial behaviour,

20
00:01:38,888 --> 00:01:41,295
and a chance to humiliate me in public.

21
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:44,307
And with a man like Brian Martin!

22
00:01:44,393 --> 00:01:46,765
It's obvious you're having an affair!

23
00:01:46,853 --> 00:01:50,020
Don't be ridiculous, George.
We were acting.

24
00:01:50,106 --> 00:01:51,814
God, what a fool I was!

25
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,272
I should never have married you!

26
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,029
So you admit it was a mistake?

27
00:01:57,113 --> 00:01:58,904
Well, I agree.

28
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:02,904
So why don't we end this misery now?
Please, George, I want a divorce.

29
00:02:02,993 --> 00:02:06,113
You think I'll give you a divorce?
Absolutely not.

30
00:02:06,204 --> 00:02:08,742
But...why not?

31
00:02:08,832 --> 00:02:12,165
Because I'm George Alfred St Vincent Marsh.
Fourth Baron Edgware.

32
00:02:12,252 --> 00:02:14,458
That's why not. You are my wife.

33
00:02:14,546 --> 00:02:17,036
And that is how you will remain!

34
00:02:24,388 --> 00:02:26,511
No, no, no.

35
00:02:26,598 --> 00:02:29,634
Cases solved, 1928-9.

36
00:02:29,726 --> 00:02:32,134
A-N. Poisons.

37
00:02:32,228 --> 00:02:34,600
That should be with the others over there.

38
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,477
1929-1933...

39
00:02:38,568 --> 00:02:40,690
Good morning, Mr Poirot.

40
00:02:40,778 --> 00:02:42,984
Bonjour, Miss Lemon.

41
00:02:43,948 --> 00:02:46,236
The last of the cases, they have arrived?

42
00:02:46,325 --> 00:02:49,160
They're just bringing them in,
but in quite the wrong order.

43
00:02:49,244 --> 00:02:53,621
I'm afraid I'm going to have to overhaul
the entire system. And the post has come.

44
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:55,953
Bon.

45
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:58,081
Let us see what we have.

46
00:02:58,169 --> 00:03:01,917
How many more of these?
Don't even ask!

47
00:03:03,215 --> 00:03:04,959
There. Come on, take another one.

48
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,339
What have we here?

49
00:03:09,012 --> 00:03:12,962
An invitation to an evening
with Miss Carlotta Adams.

50
00:03:13,058 --> 00:03:14,338
The actress.

51
00:03:14,434 --> 00:03:15,928
I do not know this name.

52
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:19,553
I read about her in the papers.
She's American, comedy actress.

53
00:03:19,647 --> 00:03:21,686
She does impersonations.

54
00:03:23,317 --> 00:03:25,310
Impersonations?

55
00:03:25,402 --> 00:03:27,395
No, no, no, no.

56
00:03:27,488 --> 00:03:29,527
This is not for Poirot.

57
00:03:29,615 --> 00:03:32,983
- Why they invite me, even, I cannot imagine.
- Careful!

58
00:03:37,205 --> 00:03:39,244
We have a telegram.

59
00:03:41,751 --> 00:03:43,909
Mon Dieu!
It is from the good Captain Hastings.

60
00:03:44,003 --> 00:03:47,122
- All the way from Argentina?
- No, no, no, Miss Lemon.

61
00:03:47,214 --> 00:03:49,207
This is sent from Paris.

62
00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:53,167
He writes that he is in transit
from Buenos Aires to London.

63
00:03:53,261 --> 00:03:56,511
And the aeroplane, it arrives...

64
00:03:58,057 --> 00:04:00,216
..in just one hour from now.

65
00:04:01,394 --> 00:04:05,687
- What about his wife?
- Of course, she will be with him.

66
00:04:08,567 --> 00:04:12,102
Come, Miss Lemon, vite, vite!
They must already be here.

67
00:04:12,195 --> 00:04:13,855
Don't worry, Mr Poirot.

68
00:04:13,947 --> 00:04:16,734
- He won't have passed through customs yet.
- Excuse me!

69
00:04:16,825 --> 00:04:18,734
- The flight from Paris, sir?
- Oui.

70
00:04:18,827 --> 00:04:20,700
It landed about 20 minutes ago.

71
00:04:22,372 --> 00:04:26,784
If you please, can you tell me if there was
a passenger called Captain Arthur Hastings?

72
00:04:26,876 --> 00:04:28,156
One moment, sir.

73
00:04:30,546 --> 00:04:33,037
Mr Poirot. There he is now.

74
00:04:35,634 --> 00:04:36,879
Hastings!

75
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,336
Poirot, my dear chap!

76
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:45,672
Mon cher Hastings, it was beyond
all my expectations to see you again so soon.

77
00:04:45,768 --> 00:04:49,184
- Welcome home, Captain Hastings.
- Miss Lemon.

78
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:55,231
All these baggages?

79
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:58,734
- Well, they're all mine.
- You intend to remain here for some time?

80
00:04:58,822 --> 00:05:00,565
Well, er...yes.

81
00:05:00,657 --> 00:05:03,492
And Madame Hastings?

82
00:05:08,331 --> 00:05:12,577
Everything was going fine
until I made a foolish mistake.

83
00:05:12,668 --> 00:05:17,211
I invested in the Pampas de Fernandez
Consolidated Railway.

84
00:05:17,297 --> 00:05:20,880
Well, they weren't consolidated.
They didn't have a railway.

85
00:05:20,967 --> 00:05:24,051
And there's a huge mountain range
between the two places.

86
00:05:24,137 --> 00:05:26,213
I lost just about everything.

87
00:05:27,098 --> 00:05:29,671
Poor Bella stayed behind to sell the ranch.

88
00:05:29,767 --> 00:05:32,471
I've come over here
to find somewhere for us to live.

89
00:05:32,561 --> 00:05:35,811
Not that she's said a word against me.
She's such a wonderful person.

90
00:05:35,898 --> 00:05:38,815
We're still as much in love as the day we met.

91
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,732
When, if I remember correctly, you thought her
guilty of murder, n'est-ce pas?

92
00:05:43,905 --> 00:05:48,365
Yes, well, since then, I think I've learned
what makes women tick.

93
00:05:48,451 --> 00:05:49,565
Ah, yes.

94
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,202
The ticking of the women.

95
00:05:51,287 --> 00:05:53,493
It has always been a mystery to Poirot.

96
00:05:55,999 --> 00:05:59,285
Where will you stay while you're in London,
Captain Hastings?

97
00:05:59,378 --> 00:06:01,749
I'm booked into the Palace.

98
00:06:01,838 --> 00:06:06,547
The Piccadilly Palace Hotel.
I'll start looking for a flat as soon as possible.

99
00:06:06,634 --> 00:06:09,339
If I can afford London prices.

100
00:06:09,428 --> 00:06:11,753
Poor Captain Hastings.

101
00:06:13,098 --> 00:06:14,806
You need taking out of yourself.

102
00:06:14,892 --> 00:06:16,635
I know...

103
00:06:16,727 --> 00:06:18,554
why don't you take him to that show?

104
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:19,808
Show?

105
00:06:19,896 --> 00:06:23,894
Carlotta Adams. It's on tonight
and everyone says she's most amusing.

106
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:25,727
I'm sure you'll both enjoy it.

107
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:28,523
No, Miss Lemon,
I'm sure it would be of no interest at all.

108
00:06:28,613 --> 00:06:31,530
Well, actually, it might be
just what the doctor ordered.

109
00:06:31,616 --> 00:06:33,573
I haven't any other plans.

110
00:06:38,956 --> 00:06:42,739
- Leave me alone, Brian, just leave me alone!
- You invited me, do you remember?

111
00:06:42,834 --> 00:06:44,827
I thought we could still be friends.

112
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:47,327
Your husband was right.
You are completely heartless.

113
00:06:47,422 --> 00:06:48,999
That's not fair.

114
00:06:50,091 --> 00:06:52,760
Jane, if we are going
to be seen together in public,

115
00:06:52,843 --> 00:06:54,670
we may as well at least put on an act.

116
00:07:07,023 --> 00:07:10,143
- Who is that, Hastings?
- That's Jane Wilkinson, the actress.

117
00:07:11,194 --> 00:07:14,397
What a beautiful woman, Poirot!

118
00:07:14,488 --> 00:07:18,817
Yes, indeed. But also, I am thinking,
the unhappy one.

119
00:07:19,618 --> 00:07:23,034
Pour me a gin and tonic, Godfrey,
and make it a large one.

120
00:07:23,121 --> 00:07:24,781
I've been in America, you know.

121
00:07:24,873 --> 00:07:29,285
I haven't had a drink in 13 years.

122
00:07:29,377 --> 00:07:32,828
You're really very good!

123
00:07:37,843 --> 00:07:41,461
President Roosevelt is ending Prohibition.

124
00:07:41,555 --> 00:07:44,639
I don't believe it. What's the man doing?

125
00:07:44,725 --> 00:07:47,429
He must be drunk.

126
00:07:51,481 --> 00:07:53,390
Meanwhile, in Berlin,

127
00:07:53,483 --> 00:07:56,234
the new Chancellor is prohibiting everything.

128
00:07:58,154 --> 00:08:00,727
I say zis to you today.

129
00:08:00,823 --> 00:08:02,862
I vill prohibit the artists.

130
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,907
I vill prohibit the writers.

131
00:08:04,993 --> 00:08:08,362
If you don't agree with me, I vill prohibit you!

132
00:08:14,085 --> 00:08:16,373
Good grief!

133
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:19,878
Someone has shot Herr Hitler.

134
00:08:19,965 --> 00:08:21,210
So...

135
00:08:22,092 --> 00:08:23,800
Whom do we call in?

136
00:08:40,776 --> 00:08:42,733
Ah! Regarde.

137
00:08:43,737 --> 00:08:46,821
Zere is a dead body on ze floor.

138
00:08:46,907 --> 00:08:50,275
I will now'ave to use my little grey cells.

139
00:08:52,495 --> 00:08:55,496
But why 'as Monsieur 'itler been assassinated?

140
00:08:55,581 --> 00:08:58,452
Was it, perhaps, his polltics?

141
00:08:59,377 --> 00:09:00,456
Non.

142
00:09:00,544 --> 00:09:02,786
I think it was, instead,

143
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,880
because of his ridiculous...

144
00:09:05,966 --> 00:09:07,958
moustache.

145
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,185
Well, thank you, Poirot. I really enjoyed that.

146
00:09:28,278 --> 00:09:31,195
I must say, I thought the impressions
were absolutely spot on.

147
00:09:31,281 --> 00:09:35,907
You thought so, Hastings? For me,
they were something of an exaggeration.

148
00:09:35,994 --> 00:09:37,653
- Mr Poirot...
- Madame.

149
00:09:37,745 --> 00:09:40,366
My name is Jane Wilkinson, and er...

150
00:09:41,749 --> 00:09:44,952
I know this isn't really the place,
but I noticed you were here and...

151
00:09:45,044 --> 00:09:46,751
I wonder...

152
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:49,421
I very much need your help.

153
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:50,786
Jane!

154
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:56,967
Hey! And the real Hercule Poirot!

155
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:59,842
I didn't know you two were friends.

156
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,885
Carlotta.

157
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:04,967
Mademoiselle.

158
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:09,439
I'm really glad you came to the show, Mr Poirot.
It's just great for the publicity.

159
00:10:09,524 --> 00:10:12,015
Why don't you come over for a drink?

160
00:10:13,445 --> 00:10:14,725
Well, er...

161
00:10:16,614 --> 00:10:19,236
I would be content to join you, mademoiselle.

162
00:10:19,325 --> 00:10:20,488
Great!

163
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,824
Look who I just found.

164
00:10:25,915 --> 00:10:29,746
Mr Poirot, this is my very best friend in London,
Penny Driver,

165
00:10:29,835 --> 00:10:32,373
who makes the most wonderful hats.

166
00:10:32,462 --> 00:10:34,455
How do you do, Mr Poirot?

167
00:10:34,548 --> 00:10:35,828
Mademoiselle.

168
00:10:35,924 --> 00:10:37,833
You must know Brian Martin.

169
00:10:37,926 --> 00:10:39,088
Monsieur Martin.

170
00:10:39,177 --> 00:10:41,632
And this is Ronald Marsh.

171
00:10:41,721 --> 00:10:45,054
- I'm a theatrical producer, Mr Poirot.
- Monsieur Marsh.

172
00:10:45,141 --> 00:10:48,225
Trying to sign on Carlotta.
How did you enjoy the show?

173
00:10:49,686 --> 00:10:53,020
Well, it was most...educational.

174
00:10:53,106 --> 00:10:54,565
I thought it was splendid.

175
00:10:55,525 --> 00:10:57,683
Well, please sit down. Join us.

176
00:10:57,777 --> 00:10:59,437
Waiter, more champagne.

177
00:11:03,824 --> 00:11:07,324
So, what were you doing
sneaking off to see Mr Poirot, Jane?

178
00:11:07,411 --> 00:11:08,786
No, don't tell us.

179
00:11:08,871 --> 00:11:14,245
You are hiring him to help you bump off
that ghastly husband of yours.

180
00:11:14,334 --> 00:11:16,742
- Don't be absurd, Carlotta.
- Why not?

181
00:11:16,836 --> 00:11:20,122
Mr Poirot solves lots of crimes.
Committing one would be a cinch.

182
00:11:20,215 --> 00:11:24,710
The bumping off of husbands
is not one of my specialities, mademoiselle.

183
00:11:25,678 --> 00:11:29,592
But she's got a point, you know. Getting rid
of Lord Edgware would do us all a favour.

184
00:11:29,682 --> 00:11:32,682
Why does he have to be
so horrible and unreasonable?

185
00:11:32,768 --> 00:11:35,519
I almost think I could kill him sometimes.

186
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,180
But you shouldn't talk like that, Carlotta,
you're embarrassing Mr Poirot.

187
00:11:40,275 --> 00:11:43,478
Well, you know us Americans,
we speak as we think.

188
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:45,894
Here's to you, Carlotta, darling.

189
00:11:45,988 --> 00:11:48,906
As deadly accurate as always.

190
00:11:50,451 --> 00:11:53,120
The deadly Carlotta Adams.

191
00:11:54,913 --> 00:11:56,372
- Carlotta.
- Carlotta.

192
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,786
We didn't get much entertainment in Argentina.

193
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:06,828
Horse shows and cattle shows,
but no actual shows, if you know what I mean.

194
00:12:06,924 --> 00:12:08,466
Mr Poirot!

195
00:12:08,551 --> 00:12:10,294
Madame?

196
00:12:10,386 --> 00:12:15,178
I'm sorry. I couldn't talk to you back there,
but I really do need your help.

197
00:12:15,265 --> 00:12:18,100
It is a matter that concerns
your husband, madame?

198
00:12:18,185 --> 00:12:22,727
Well, he's not really my husband any more.
We live quite separate lives, but...

199
00:12:22,814 --> 00:12:26,514
Well, you see, he refuses to give me a divorce.

200
00:12:26,609 --> 00:12:29,361
It is perhaps because
he still has feelings for you.

201
00:12:29,445 --> 00:12:30,939
Oh, no, I don't think so.

202
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:34,813
I don't think George has feelings for anyone.
He's a queer man.

203
00:12:34,908 --> 00:12:37,660
His first wife ran away from him, you know.

204
00:12:38,578 --> 00:12:40,618
She died in complete poverty.

205
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,916
And now...

206
00:12:44,918 --> 00:12:47,325
...he enjoys tormenting me, Mr Poirot.

207
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:50,670
What is it that you wish me to do, madame?

208
00:12:53,342 --> 00:12:55,050
Could you talk to him for me?

209
00:12:56,011 --> 00:13:00,174
I know it sounds strange,
but there really is no-one else I can turn to.

210
00:13:00,265 --> 00:13:05,259
If you could just tell him that you'd met me
and let him know what he's doing to me,

211
00:13:05,353 --> 00:13:08,105
maybe, coming from you,
it might mean something.

212
00:13:11,484 --> 00:13:15,433
- Your husband, Lord Edgware...
- He has a house at Regent Gate.

213
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:18,565
He travels a lot,
but he's in England at the moment.

214
00:13:19,908 --> 00:13:21,984
I really have to go back.

215
00:13:23,453 --> 00:13:26,158
Will you do it for me, Mr Poirot?

216
00:13:27,582 --> 00:13:30,155
It's killing me...this whole business.

217
00:13:31,252 --> 00:13:33,079
I don't know how much more I can bear.

218
00:13:36,006 --> 00:13:38,378
I will visit your husband, madame,

219
00:13:38,467 --> 00:13:40,044
and see what I can do.

220
00:13:41,636 --> 00:13:42,965
Thank you.

221
00:13:43,972 --> 00:13:45,514
Thank you.

222
00:13:47,058 --> 00:13:49,264
I was so glad when I saw you here tonight.

223
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:05,362
Tell me, Hastings,
what is your opinion of this Jane Wilkinson?

224
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,526
Very attractive.

225
00:14:07,619 --> 00:14:08,947
Yes, indeed.

226
00:14:09,037 --> 00:14:12,488
But it is the psychology
that is of interest to Poirot.

227
00:14:17,294 --> 00:14:20,129
Monsieur Poirot and Captain Hastings,
 My Lord.

228
00:14:21,381 --> 00:14:24,382
I can't give you a lot of time, Mr Poirot.

229
00:14:24,468 --> 00:14:27,468
I'm leaving for Paris tomorrow morning.

230
00:14:27,554 --> 00:14:29,463
There's a painting I wish to acquire.

231
00:14:29,556 --> 00:14:32,046
Has the bank sent round those francs yet, Alton?

232
00:14:32,141 --> 00:14:34,466
I don't believe so, my lord.

233
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,051
Well, ring them and tell them to get a move on.

234
00:14:37,146 --> 00:14:38,344
Very well, my lord.

235
00:14:42,484 --> 00:14:43,895
Now, in this er...

236
00:14:43,986 --> 00:14:46,061
note you sent me,

237
00:14:46,154 --> 00:14:49,570
- you said you were acting for my wife.
- That is so.

238
00:14:49,657 --> 00:14:52,231
I thought you were something to do with crimes.

239
00:14:52,327 --> 00:14:53,869
What do you want with me?

240
00:14:55,788 --> 00:14:59,121
Lady Edgware has asked me to approach you
on the matter of your divorce.

241
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,247
Yes?

242
00:15:01,335 --> 00:15:04,004
It was her suggestion
that you and I should discuss it.

243
00:15:04,087 --> 00:15:06,376
There's nothing to discuss.

244
00:15:06,465 --> 00:15:07,923
So you refuse?

245
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:09,466
What are you talking about?

246
00:15:09,551 --> 00:15:12,124
I agreed to the divorce a month ago.

247
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,011
Why are you wasting my time?

248
00:15:14,889 --> 00:15:17,047
But...I do not understand.

249
00:15:17,141 --> 00:15:22,431
It's very simple. When I last saw her,
it's true I objected to the divorce.

250
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:25,522
But then, thinking it over, I changed my mind.

251
00:15:25,607 --> 00:15:29,439
- So why haven't you told her?
- I have told her. I wrote hera letter.

252
00:15:29,527 --> 00:15:32,528
I told her I'd decided
she could start proceedings after all.

253
00:15:32,614 --> 00:15:35,021
And as far as I was concerned,
the sooner the better.

254
00:15:35,116 --> 00:15:36,990
It is very curious.

255
00:15:38,035 --> 00:15:39,779
I do not understand this at all.

256
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:42,029
Is this about money?

257
00:15:42,122 --> 00:15:45,289
Because if it is, you can tell her from me
she's not getting any.

258
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,119
Now, if you don't mind.

259
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:50,128
One further question,
if you please, Lord Edgware.

260
00:15:51,131 --> 00:15:53,622
This letter that you wrote,
to where was it sent?

261
00:15:53,716 --> 00:15:57,050
To the stage door of the Regency Theatre.

262
00:15:57,136 --> 00:15:59,093
At the time, I had no other address.

263
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,840
And you posted it yourself?

264
00:16:00,931 --> 00:16:04,632
I have a secretary to do that for me, Mr Poirot.
I'm a busy man.

265
00:16:04,727 --> 00:16:08,344
Too busy, in fact,
to offer you any more of my time.

266
00:16:11,274 --> 00:16:13,018
My lord.

267
00:16:15,195 --> 00:16:18,694
You mean you've managed it? Just like that?

268
00:16:18,781 --> 00:16:22,909
Oh, dear Mr Poirot, you're wonderful.
You've saved my life.

269
00:16:23,994 --> 00:16:27,778
That is... most kind of you, madame.

270
00:16:27,873 --> 00:16:30,411
But in this instance, I have done nothing.

271
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,829
What do you mean?

272
00:16:31,918 --> 00:16:35,536
Well, Lord Edgware told us that he wrote to you
a month ago at the Regency Theatre

273
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,254
agreeing to a divorce.

274
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,131
I never got any letter.

275
00:16:40,134 --> 00:16:43,799
Tell me, would there have been anyone
in the theatre with access to your post?

276
00:16:43,888 --> 00:16:47,091
Letters for me would be held at the stage door.

277
00:16:47,182 --> 00:16:49,673
Brian sometimes got them for me.

278
00:16:49,768 --> 00:16:53,053
You're not saying someone stole it, are you?

279
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:54,640
It is a possibility, madame.

280
00:16:54,731 --> 00:16:58,016
Well, what does it matter, anyway?

281
00:16:58,109 --> 00:16:59,817
I was going completely mad,

282
00:16:59,902 --> 00:17:03,236
and then I met you,
and somehow everything's come out all right.

283
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:04,318
Alice.

284
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,156
I was invited out tonight, but I said no.

285
00:17:09,244 --> 00:17:12,364
But with what you've told me,
I feel a need to celebrate.

286
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:15,863
I am content
the results are to your liking, madame.

287
00:17:16,793 --> 00:17:19,996
- Yes, ma'am?
- I've decided to go out this evening afterall.

288
00:17:20,088 --> 00:17:22,792
- Could you call Lady Corner and let her know?
- Yes, ma'am.

289
00:17:22,882 --> 00:17:26,085
And lay out something bright.

290
00:17:26,177 --> 00:17:29,094
The new Schiaparelli, you know, the pink satin.

291
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,838
Mr Poirot.

292
00:17:32,933 --> 00:17:33,928
Madame.

293
00:17:34,893 --> 00:17:38,096
I don't suppose
you'd care to come with me tonight?

294
00:17:40,023 --> 00:17:41,137
Er...

295
00:17:41,232 --> 00:17:45,443
Alas, madame, but for me,
tonight it is not possible.

296
00:17:46,695 --> 00:17:48,522
- Another time, perhaps.
- Oui.

297
00:17:50,199 --> 00:17:52,238
I am at your service, madame.

298
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,459
I say, Poirot! You were going it a bit up there,
weren't you?

299
00:18:06,547 --> 00:18:11,043
But there is a quality in Lady Edgware that is
most attractive, do you not think, Hastings?

300
00:18:11,135 --> 00:18:13,804
- Don't tell me you're falling for her?
- No, Hastings.

301
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:16,508
Poirot, he does not fall. He observes merely.

302
00:18:16,598 --> 00:18:17,629
Hmm.

303
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:22,394
Well, er, I'd better be getting back to the hotel.

304
00:18:22,478 --> 00:18:26,725
Yes, indeed. Oh, Hastings,
the reason that I said I was occupied tonight,

305
00:18:26,816 --> 00:18:29,022
it is that I hope you will dine with me.

306
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:31,149
Oh, that's very kind of you, Poirot.

307
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:36,610
Come at 7:30, mon ami. And please, Hastings,
I beg of you, do not be late.

308
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:47,164
Where are you going,
dressed up like a dog's dinner?

309
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:50,205
I'm going to the opera.
Don Giovanni with the Dortheimers.

310
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:53,083
- Urgh! Ghastly nouveau riche.
- Father...

311
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:56,127
You could choose your friends
with a little more discretion.

312
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,341
- At least I have friends.
- Miss Carroll!

313
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:03,552
I'm working tonight and leaving early tomorrow,
so try not to disturb me.

314
00:19:03,641 --> 00:19:07,306
- You called, sir?
- Yes, I'd like to dictate a letter. Do you mind?

315
00:19:07,395 --> 00:19:09,103
It would be a pleasure, sir.

316
00:19:23,326 --> 00:19:25,365
So, how do I look?

317
00:19:25,453 --> 00:19:27,492
You look lovely, ma'am.

318
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:37,039
What a lovely evening.

319
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:39,502
I can't believe everything's going my way!

320
00:19:59,526 --> 00:20:02,278
That smells good, Mr Poirot. What is it?

321
00:20:02,362 --> 00:20:04,568
Une tourte de filet de boeuf aux rognons.

322
00:20:04,656 --> 00:20:05,818
Oh.

323
00:20:05,907 --> 00:20:08,480
Is that another recipe
from your aunt in Belgium?

324
00:20:08,576 --> 00:20:10,118
No, no, no, Miss Lemon.

325
00:20:10,203 --> 00:20:12,610
This is an invention of my own.

326
00:20:13,581 --> 00:20:16,285
A dish that I discovered during my retirement.

327
00:20:19,253 --> 00:20:21,328
The pudding of the steak with the kidneys.

328
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:26,836
Bon.

329
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:29,499
- The table, it is laid?
- Four places.

330
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:32,884
There's the first guest.

331
00:20:32,974 --> 00:20:33,969
Ah.

332
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:42,225
- Chief lnspector.
- Very nice to see you again, Miss Lemon.

333
00:20:42,315 --> 00:20:43,940
Come in.

334
00:20:46,027 --> 00:20:48,732
Mmm, something smells good.
Poirot cooking?

335
00:20:48,821 --> 00:20:50,695
Steak and kidney pudding.

336
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:51,980
Ah!

337
00:20:52,074 --> 00:20:54,648
Then this is just what you'll need.

338
00:21:02,793 --> 00:21:03,991
Sir.

339
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,046
- Captain Hastings? Your taxi's ready.
- Oh, right. Thank you.

340
00:21:10,967 --> 00:21:12,509
Oh, excuse me.

341
00:21:14,553 --> 00:21:17,424
- Room 174.
- Certainly, Mrs Van Dusen.

342
00:21:27,857 --> 00:21:30,395
Thank you, Thompson. That is excellent.

343
00:21:34,906 --> 00:21:36,779
- Monty?
- My dear?

344
00:21:36,866 --> 00:21:38,443
The table.

345
00:21:38,534 --> 00:21:40,692
It's set for 13.

346
00:21:40,786 --> 00:21:42,066
Is it?

347
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:47,035
- Oh, yes. Well, that's Lady Edgware, isn't it?
- Is it?

348
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:49,663
She cancelled,
so I invited young Ross to join us.

349
00:21:49,753 --> 00:21:52,160
He accepted. Now she says she's coming.

350
00:21:52,255 --> 00:21:54,046
So that makes 13.

351
00:21:54,924 --> 00:21:57,249
But it's bad luck, isn't it?

352
00:21:57,343 --> 00:21:59,051
I should say it's rather good luck.

353
00:21:59,136 --> 00:22:02,587
I've been wanting to meet her.
She's very glamorous.

354
00:22:02,681 --> 00:22:06,014
Ah, our first guests, Eleanor.

355
00:22:18,612 --> 00:22:21,483
- Thank you, Miss Carroll.
- Can I get you anything, sir?

356
00:22:21,574 --> 00:22:24,527
- What?
- I was going to have a drink, and I wondered...

357
00:22:24,618 --> 00:22:28,662
What are you talking about, woman? Are you
suggesting I'd want to have a drink with you?

358
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:31,534
- Well, sir, I...
- You're getting airs above your station.

359
00:22:31,624 --> 00:22:34,329
Maybe you should start looking for another job.

360
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:35,913
Now get out.

361
00:22:41,592 --> 00:22:44,343
There's nothing like marriage,
that's the truth of it.

362
00:22:44,428 --> 00:22:46,136
The day I met Bella,

363
00:22:46,221 --> 00:22:48,463
it was as if I'd found myself.

364
00:22:48,557 --> 00:22:51,593
Ever since,
I've been a completely different man.

365
00:22:51,685 --> 00:22:54,638
Hmm, different man, yes.
Could say the same about me, I suppose.

366
00:22:54,729 --> 00:22:58,180
But you're happily married, Chief lnspector.

367
00:22:58,274 --> 00:23:00,065
I don't know about that, Miss Lemon.

368
00:23:00,151 --> 00:23:02,938
You see, my Emily,
she just doesn't understand my work.

369
00:23:03,028 --> 00:23:06,777
She never lets me talk about murder
at the dinner table.

370
00:23:06,865 --> 00:23:09,154
And her tidying!
It just gets worse and worse.

371
00:23:09,242 --> 00:23:12,576
Sometimes, I wonder how I've lived with her
these 27-and-a-half years.

372
00:23:14,539 --> 00:23:18,536
It's a shame you've never
considered marriage, Mr Poirot.

373
00:23:21,921 --> 00:23:25,870
There were occasions, Miss Lemon,
when I did have la tentation.

374
00:23:25,966 --> 00:23:30,213
The temptation. But now, alas,
I think it is too late.

375
00:23:30,303 --> 00:23:32,260
Oh, I wouldn't say that, Poirot.

376
00:23:32,347 --> 00:23:36,047
If the right woman came along...
Jane Wilkinson, for example?

377
00:23:37,393 --> 00:23:39,516
Will you have some wine, Chief Inspector?

378
00:23:39,604 --> 00:23:41,513
A fine Pauillac?

379
00:23:41,606 --> 00:23:43,847
No, thanks, Poirot, I'll stick to my stout.

380
00:23:46,819 --> 00:23:50,353
Donald Ross is a name
that will shortly be known to everyone.

381
00:23:50,447 --> 00:23:54,065
Just as soon as he finishes his play
on the great war of Troy.

382
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,820
I started right at the beginning.

383
00:23:56,911 --> 00:24:00,161
I'm going all the way
to the Trojan Horse and beyond.

384
00:24:00,248 --> 00:24:02,489
It's going to be a bit like Sophocles.

385
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:03,781
An epic.

386
00:24:03,876 --> 00:24:05,584
But for a modern '30s audience.

387
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:09,168
Lady Edgware,
you have a telephone call, ma'am.

388
00:24:09,256 --> 00:24:10,536
For me?

389
00:24:10,632 --> 00:24:12,257
Excuse me.

390
00:24:25,354 --> 00:24:26,599
Hello?

391
00:24:39,784 --> 00:24:41,823
- Brian!
- I had to see you.

392
00:25:39,589 --> 00:25:42,080
You're Alton, aren't you?
Is my husband in?

393
00:25:42,175 --> 00:25:43,455
Yes, ma'am.

394
00:25:51,642 --> 00:25:53,848
It's all right, Alton. I know the way.

395
00:25:53,936 --> 00:25:55,644
Yes, ma'am.

396
00:26:09,158 --> 00:26:11,565
- The Dortheimers?
- They're still in their seats.

397
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,700
Then let's go.

398
00:26:41,605 --> 00:26:44,226
Right. Thank you very much, Poirot.

399
00:26:44,315 --> 00:26:46,771
Nice bit of steak and kidney, I must say.

400
00:26:46,859 --> 00:26:48,935
Thank you, Chief Inspector.

401
00:26:49,028 --> 00:26:50,606
It's funny, you know.

402
00:26:50,696 --> 00:26:55,157
Here we are, the four of us, all together again.
But, of course, there's one thing missing.

403
00:26:55,242 --> 00:26:59,322
- What's that?
- The body. That's how we normally meet.

404
00:26:59,413 --> 00:27:00,955
No, but it is true.

405
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:05,582
Oh, well, never mind, Poirot. As soon as word
gets round you're back, I'm sure one will turn up.

406
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:57,465
- Morning, Poirot, Captain Hastings.
- Chief Inspector.

407
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,293
You got my message, then?

408
00:27:59,385 --> 00:28:01,507
Yes, Chief Inspector.
We came immediately.

409
00:28:01,595 --> 00:28:03,587
Looks like we spoke too soon last night.

410
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,838
Stabbed in the neck, round about ten o'clock.

411
00:28:09,894 --> 00:28:12,432
- Have you discovered any money?
- Money?

412
00:28:12,522 --> 00:28:14,348
When we were last here,

413
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:18,484
Lord Edgware had commanded from his bank
a sum of money in francs.

414
00:28:18,569 --> 00:28:22,234
- That's right. He was just about to go to Paris.
- We haven't found any money.

415
00:28:22,322 --> 00:28:26,320
But I'd be interested to know what you two
were doing here? Had he asked for your help?

416
00:28:26,409 --> 00:28:28,532
Non. No, Chief Inspector.

417
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:32,071
It was Lady Edgware who had asked for me
to intercede on her behalf.

418
00:28:32,165 --> 00:28:34,323
She wanted her husband to give her a divorce.

419
00:28:34,417 --> 00:28:36,872
So that's the motive, then, is it?

420
00:28:36,961 --> 00:28:38,585
The motive, Chief Inspector?

421
00:28:38,671 --> 00:28:41,292
I already know it was her.
I just want to find out why.

422
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:47,342
Now, then, Alton. I want you to tell my friends
here exactly what you told me.

423
00:28:47,429 --> 00:28:48,757
Yes, sir.

424
00:28:48,847 --> 00:28:51,302
I answered the door just after half past nine.

425
00:28:51,391 --> 00:28:56,764
I'd heard the clock sound the half hour,
that's how I'm sure of the time.

426
00:28:56,854 --> 00:28:58,597
It was Lady Edgware.

427
00:28:58,689 --> 00:29:02,354
She said she wanted to see her husband
and that she could find her own way.

428
00:29:02,443 --> 00:29:04,020
You saw her enter the study?

429
00:29:04,111 --> 00:29:07,195
No, sir, but as I left,

430
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,189
she was approaching the door.

431
00:29:09,282 --> 00:29:11,275
Was it you who discovered the body?

432
00:29:11,367 --> 00:29:12,612
Yes, sir.

433
00:29:12,702 --> 00:29:14,576
This morning at eight.

434
00:29:14,662 --> 00:29:16,951
I entered the study to open the curtains.

435
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,661
That's when I called the police.

436
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:22,122
Could you tell me, Monsieur Alton,

437
00:29:22,211 --> 00:29:25,165
what happened to the francs
your master demanded yesterday?

438
00:29:25,255 --> 00:29:29,716
They came in the afternoon. I imagine
he would have placed them in the safe.

439
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:32,837
Lord Edgware's solicitor
will have a combination.

440
00:29:33,763 --> 00:29:36,301
You have worked here for how long,
Monsieur Alton?

441
00:29:38,184 --> 00:29:39,927
One month, sir.

442
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,726
And how many times
have you met Lady Edgware?

443
00:29:43,814 --> 00:29:46,815
Only once, sir,
but I could have sworn it was her.

444
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,976
It was her!

445
00:29:49,069 --> 00:29:50,896
I'd know her anywhere.

446
00:29:50,987 --> 00:29:52,861
And I saw her quite clearly.

447
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,739
I heard her speaking with Alton.

448
00:30:02,832 --> 00:30:05,536
Then she crossed the hall
and went in through there.

449
00:30:05,626 --> 00:30:08,247
Could you tell me, mademoiselle,
what she was wearing?

450
00:30:08,337 --> 00:30:10,294
She was wearing black.

451
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:13,963
A black dress and lace sleeves. And a hat.

452
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:16,292
And this hat, it was also black?

453
00:30:16,386 --> 00:30:19,505
Yes. Very modern, with a slanting brim.

454
00:30:22,058 --> 00:30:23,172
I see.

455
00:30:30,273 --> 00:30:32,943
And after she went into the study?

456
00:30:33,026 --> 00:30:34,141
Sorry?

457
00:30:34,228 --> 00:30:37,728
- You heard nothing? No sound of any kind?
- No, I told you. I went to bed.

458
00:30:37,816 --> 00:30:41,684
Who else was in the house last night,
Miss Carroll, apart from you and Alton?

459
00:30:41,779 --> 00:30:46,193
Only Geraldine, Lord Edgware's daughter.
She's in her room now.

460
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,500
I didn't love my father.

461
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,546
I suppose I could lie to you, but why should I?

462
00:31:00,427 --> 00:31:02,467
I hated him.

463
00:31:02,554 --> 00:31:04,880
And if someone's gone and killed him, I'm glad.

464
00:31:05,892 --> 00:31:07,600
There you are.

465
00:31:09,313 --> 00:31:13,311
I wonder if you could tell us your movements
last night, Miss Marsh?

466
00:31:13,401 --> 00:31:14,979
If you insist.

467
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:18,689
I went to the opera.
Don Giovanni at Covent Garden.

468
00:31:18,782 --> 00:31:22,567
I left at around seven
and I wasn't back until well after midnight.

469
00:31:22,662 --> 00:31:24,739
When I got home, I went straight to bed.

470
00:31:25,666 --> 00:31:26,864
Satisfied?

471
00:31:27,794 --> 00:31:30,879
- Did you enter the study of your father?
- No.

472
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:35,793
There was a light on under the door,
but I didn't want to see him.

473
00:31:35,887 --> 00:31:37,714
I never wanted to see him.

474
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,642
I don't suppose there's anyone
who can corroborate your story?

475
00:31:41,727 --> 00:31:43,685
You could talk to my cousin, if you like.

476
00:31:44,814 --> 00:31:47,436
Ronald Marsh. He was at the opera.

477
00:31:47,526 --> 00:31:50,018
In fact, we had a drink together in the interval.

478
00:31:50,112 --> 00:31:52,900
But why are you wasting your time
interrogating me?

479
00:31:52,991 --> 00:31:54,486
Why aren't you talking to Jane?

480
00:31:54,576 --> 00:31:57,613
- Lady Edgware?
- Well, she was here, wasn't she?

481
00:31:58,581 --> 00:32:00,870
Miss Carroll saw her, and Alton.

482
00:32:02,169 --> 00:32:04,495
It seems to me
you've got an open-and-shut case.

483
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:11,339
Murdered?

484
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,973
Oui, madame.

485
00:32:16,061 --> 00:32:17,259
Well...

486
00:32:19,523 --> 00:32:21,101
I suppose...

487
00:32:22,527 --> 00:32:24,935
..I can't say I'm surprised.

488
00:32:26,866 --> 00:32:28,906
He wasn't a kind man.

489
00:32:28,993 --> 00:32:30,618
Or a good one.

490
00:32:30,704 --> 00:32:32,946
But it's still horrible.

491
00:32:34,375 --> 00:32:36,664
Nobody deserves to die like that.

492
00:32:42,134 --> 00:32:44,174
But why are you here?

493
00:32:45,222 --> 00:32:46,846
Mr Poirot, you can't think...

494
00:32:46,932 --> 00:32:50,017
Can you tell us your movements
last night, Lady Edgware?

495
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:53,642
I told you, I changed my mind.

496
00:32:54,733 --> 00:32:58,317
I was going to stay in, but in the end
I went to that dinner in Holborn.

497
00:32:58,404 --> 00:33:00,362
To the house of Sir Montagu Corner?

498
00:33:00,448 --> 00:33:03,201
Yes. There were at least a dozen people there.

499
00:33:03,285 --> 00:33:04,863
You can ask him.

500
00:33:04,954 --> 00:33:08,288
And there was a young writer, Donald Ross.

501
00:33:08,375 --> 00:33:11,792
He's writing a play about Troy.
He was sitting opposite me.

502
00:33:11,879 --> 00:33:14,631
Bon. If you please, madame,

503
00:33:14,716 --> 00:33:19,046
could you relate to the Chief Inspector
your movements for the evening in its entirety?

504
00:33:20,139 --> 00:33:21,468
Certainly.

505
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:24,427
I left here at about seven.

506
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,640
And I went first to the Piccadilly Palace Hotel.

507
00:33:27,732 --> 00:33:29,440
Oh, that's where I'm staying.

508
00:33:31,403 --> 00:33:33,147
Sorry.

509
00:33:34,115 --> 00:33:36,571
I had a meeting with an American lady.

510
00:33:36,659 --> 00:33:38,035
A Mrs Van Dusen.

511
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,907
She's written a play. Not a very good one.

512
00:33:40,998 --> 00:33:43,620
And we talked about it for about 20 minutes.

513
00:33:44,502 --> 00:33:47,124
At 7:30, I left and took a cab to Holborn.

514
00:33:48,048 --> 00:33:50,587
I was at dinner with the Corners
until after midnight,

515
00:33:50,677 --> 00:33:52,586
and then I came straight home.

516
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:54,589
Did you leave the table at any time?

517
00:33:55,891 --> 00:33:57,006
Yes.

518
00:33:57,101 --> 00:33:58,809
Once.

519
00:33:58,895 --> 00:34:02,062
I received a telephone call
at about half past nine.

520
00:34:02,149 --> 00:34:03,394
Who was that from?

521
00:34:03,484 --> 00:34:05,144
That was the funny thing.

522
00:34:05,236 --> 00:34:07,692
A voice said, "Is that Lady Edgware?"

523
00:34:07,781 --> 00:34:11,447
And when I said it was,
they laughed and rang off.

524
00:34:12,787 --> 00:34:15,076
I thought it must be some sort of a hoax.

525
00:34:15,165 --> 00:34:16,825
This voice, madame,

526
00:34:16,917 --> 00:34:18,910
it was of a man or a woman?

527
00:34:20,046 --> 00:34:21,955
A woman, I think.

528
00:34:22,048 --> 00:34:26,795
So you're telling me that apart from
that one time, you never left the room?

529
00:34:27,847 --> 00:34:29,128
That's right.

530
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:34,893
Chief Inspector, I was the last person
to want my husband dead.

531
00:34:35,815 --> 00:34:38,437
Not after what Mr Poirot had told me.

532
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,398
He was nothing to me any more.

533
00:34:41,489 --> 00:34:43,114
Nothing.

534
00:34:46,995 --> 00:34:48,989
So, Chief Inspector,

535
00:34:49,081 --> 00:34:51,703
now it all begins to make sense.

536
00:34:51,793 --> 00:34:53,620
- Not to me, it doesn't.
- Oh, yes.

537
00:34:53,712 --> 00:34:58,624
Yesterday evening, Lady Edgware
had intended to remain on her own in her flat.

538
00:34:58,718 --> 00:35:02,302
She had already announced she would
not be attending the dinner at Holborn.

539
00:35:02,389 --> 00:35:04,963
So, in other words,
everyone knew she had no alibi.

540
00:35:05,059 --> 00:35:06,518
Oui. C'est ça.

541
00:35:06,603 --> 00:35:09,723
But it was only at the last minute
that she changed her mind

542
00:35:09,815 --> 00:35:11,938
and so disrupted the plans of the true killer.

543
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:17,733
Are you suggesting that someone went round
to Regent Gate pretending to be Lady Edgware?

544
00:35:17,825 --> 00:35:20,826
It was an attempt most deliberate
to incriminate her, yes.

545
00:35:20,912 --> 00:35:25,242
- So it's lucky she went to that dinner after all.
- Well, let's just be sure she did first.

546
00:35:29,047 --> 00:35:32,915
Oh, yes. She was certainly
at our little dinner party.

547
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:36,214
She was quite the life and soul
of the evening, Monsieur Poirot.

548
00:35:36,306 --> 00:35:38,346
She'd had some good news.

549
00:35:38,433 --> 00:35:40,806
Something to do with her divorce.

550
00:35:40,895 --> 00:35:43,813
I think it was the fact
that her husband had agreed to one.

551
00:35:43,898 --> 00:35:47,233
- You were present also, Monsieur Ross?
- I was sitting opposite her.

552
00:35:47,319 --> 00:35:50,440
Did she talk much about herself, Mr Ross?

553
00:35:50,532 --> 00:35:52,988
To be honest,
I was the one who did most of the talking.

554
00:35:53,076 --> 00:35:55,069
Yes, but she was very cheerful.

555
00:35:55,162 --> 00:35:58,532
And with good reason.
With the divorce agreed,

556
00:35:58,625 --> 00:36:01,745
I imagine she was looking forward
to stepping out with...

557
00:36:03,756 --> 00:36:05,998
I think you know who.

558
00:36:07,511 --> 00:36:10,002
No, monsieur, I do not know who.

559
00:36:10,097 --> 00:36:11,675
The Duke of Merton.

560
00:36:11,766 --> 00:36:14,471
He's one of the richest men in England.

561
00:36:14,561 --> 00:36:19,604
He has properties all over London.
My wife would dearly love to have him to dinner.

562
00:36:19,692 --> 00:36:23,773
And they have known each other for some time,
Lady Edgware and the Duke?

563
00:36:23,864 --> 00:36:27,400
- No, I believe they met only recently.
- Must have been love at first sight.

564
00:36:27,493 --> 00:36:31,788
Is it true that Lady Edgware took
a telephone call while she was here?

565
00:36:31,874 --> 00:36:33,618
Yes. Now, when was it?

566
00:36:33,709 --> 00:36:35,619
About half past nine.

567
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:39,461
But she was only out of the room
for a couple of minutes, no longer than that.

568
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:42,468
She was the first to leave the table.

569
00:36:42,553 --> 00:36:43,882
I'm sorry, Lady Corner?

570
00:36:43,972 --> 00:36:48,434
I mentioned it to my husband,
just before the guests arrived.

571
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:52,019
There were 13 of us to dinner.
And you know the old superstition.

572
00:36:52,107 --> 00:36:54,515
Yes, the first person to leave the table...

573
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:56,603
Nobody believes that.

574
00:36:56,696 --> 00:37:01,157
We had 13 to dinner,
and she was the first to get up.

575
00:37:02,536 --> 00:37:04,529
It means she's going to die.

576
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,922
I've got the money. L500.

577
00:37:25,856 --> 00:37:27,684
It's all here, walting for you.

578
00:37:27,775 --> 00:37:30,349
If you don't believe me,
you only have to come round.

579
00:37:33,366 --> 00:37:35,406
- Ronald.
- Gerry, my dear.

580
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,696
So, how does it feel?

581
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:41,363
- What?
- To be the new Lord Edgware?

582
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:44,710
No more creditors, for a start.
It's splendid.

583
00:37:45,672 --> 00:37:47,381
Have you spoken to the police yet?

584
00:37:47,466 --> 00:37:49,625
Yes. They were at the house this morning.

585
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:53,552
A Chief Inspector
and this weird, little French detective.

586
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,717
Oh, that'll be Hercule Poirot.

587
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:57,518
So he's on the case?

588
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:01,103
Did you tell him where you were last night?

589
00:38:01,191 --> 00:38:03,065
Yes. I said I was at the opera.

590
00:38:03,152 --> 00:38:04,350
That's right.

591
00:38:04,445 --> 00:38:07,019
Anyway, they weren't interested in me.

592
00:38:07,908 --> 00:38:09,450
It's Jane they want to see.

593
00:38:09,535 --> 00:38:11,362
Poor Jane.

594
00:38:11,454 --> 00:38:13,696
She's starring in my new play, you know.

595
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:15,450
Or she was.

596
00:38:15,542 --> 00:38:17,416
Of course, if they arrest her...

597
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:19,959
You can always recast.

598
00:38:22,926 --> 00:38:25,050
Oh, look, Captain Hastings.

599
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:27,711
There's a basement flat here
on the Talgarth Road.

600
00:38:27,807 --> 00:38:30,050
- Oh.

601
00:38:30,143 --> 00:38:31,852
I wonder who that can be.

602
00:38:31,937 --> 00:38:33,895
It is perhaps Lady Edgware.

603
00:38:33,981 --> 00:38:35,180
Do you think so?

604
00:38:36,276 --> 00:38:40,357
With the Chief Inspector, as you say, Hastings,
breathing down the neck,

605
00:38:40,448 --> 00:38:44,280
she will be in need most assuredly
of my assistance.

606
00:38:44,369 --> 00:38:46,409
You sound almost hopeful, Poirot.

607
00:38:46,497 --> 00:38:48,490
Mr Poirot!

608
00:38:56,342 --> 00:38:57,801
Monsieur Martin.

609
00:38:57,886 --> 00:39:00,045
I hope you don't mind my coming, Mr Poirot,

610
00:39:00,138 --> 00:39:03,591
but I was wondering, there's something
I was hoping you'd take on for me?

611
00:39:03,684 --> 00:39:06,093
If you please to sit, monsieur.

612
00:39:13,154 --> 00:39:14,946
Well, the thing is, you see, I er...

613
00:39:15,032 --> 00:39:17,702
I have a friend, a lady friend,

614
00:39:17,785 --> 00:39:19,577
and she's being followed.

615
00:39:20,497 --> 00:39:23,035
And this lady friend of yours,
she calls herself...?

616
00:39:23,125 --> 00:39:25,616
I can't tell you her name. Not yet.

617
00:39:25,711 --> 00:39:27,372
But I was with her the other day,

618
00:39:27,463 --> 00:39:29,622
and I actually saw the chap.

619
00:39:29,716 --> 00:39:33,631
Well, he's an ugly-looking fellow.
He's clean-shaven. He has glasses.

620
00:39:33,721 --> 00:39:35,798
Oh, and he has a gold tooth.

621
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:37,967
You spoke to this man?

622
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:40,053
No, he was there one minute,
gone the next.

623
00:39:40,146 --> 00:39:42,518
And I wish I could tell you more.

624
00:39:42,607 --> 00:39:47,235
But if the lady were to agree,
do you think you could possibly look into it?

625
00:39:48,489 --> 00:39:52,073
Oui, bien sur.
I find the whole story most interesting.

626
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,619
That is a relief.

627
00:39:59,628 --> 00:40:02,629
I was very pleased
to run into you the other night, Mr Poirot.

628
00:40:02,715 --> 00:40:06,001
- Do you remember, with Jane Wilkinson?
- Yes, indeed.

629
00:40:06,094 --> 00:40:10,389
I was thinking about her, you know,
and about her husband.

630
00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:15,470
It was just such an extraordinary thing for her
to say, that she'd thought about killing him.

631
00:40:15,564 --> 00:40:18,020
Do you think she had it in her to commit murder?

632
00:40:18,109 --> 00:40:19,687
I'm sure of it.

633
00:40:19,777 --> 00:40:23,527
I know her, you see.
She's terribly sweet on the surface.

634
00:40:23,615 --> 00:40:28,658
But she would kill as easily
as drink her morning tea. Believe me.

635
00:40:28,747 --> 00:40:31,618
Perhaps you are not aware
that the husband of Lady Edgware...

636
00:40:31,709 --> 00:40:33,916
he was indeed murdered last night.

637
00:40:34,003 --> 00:40:35,379
What?

638
00:40:35,463 --> 00:40:37,373
Murdered?

639
00:40:37,466 --> 00:40:39,838
You're not being serious?

640
00:40:39,927 --> 00:40:43,593
It is not a subject about which
I have the habit to joke, monsieur.

641
00:40:43,682 --> 00:40:46,387
No, but that's... Oh, my God!

642
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:49,313
What I was saying just now,
I didn't mean...

643
00:40:49,397 --> 00:40:53,561
Therefore, by necesslty, this matter of yours,
the man with the gold tooth...

644
00:40:53,652 --> 00:40:55,859
Yes, of course. That will have to wait.

645
00:40:55,947 --> 00:40:57,192
Oui.

646
00:40:57,282 --> 00:41:00,153
You will speak nonetheless
to this lady friend of yours,

647
00:41:00,244 --> 00:41:03,744
and if she wishes for me
to investigate on her behalf, then...

648
00:41:03,831 --> 00:41:07,166
Thank you very much, Mr Poirot.
I'm very grateful for your time.

649
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:09,368
Monsieur.

650
00:41:13,552 --> 00:41:15,094
- Miss Lemon.
- Mr Poirot.

651
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,888
This way, Mr Martin.

652
00:41:17,974 --> 00:41:22,019
So tell me, Hastings.
What is your opinion of all this?

653
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:26,054
It seems strange that he comes to you
for your advice and yet tells you so very little.

654
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,724
The same thought also had occurred to me.

655
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:32,866
I didn't know you knew Brian Martin, Mr Poirot.

656
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:34,575
He's a wonderful actor.

657
00:41:34,661 --> 00:41:38,362
We met him at the Gaiety Theatre
the other night. That cabaret. Carlotta Adams.

658
00:41:38,457 --> 00:41:41,079
- The impressionist.
- Mon Dieu!

659
00:41:41,169 --> 00:41:45,214
- How could I have been so blind?
- Mr Poirot?

660
00:41:45,299 --> 00:41:49,547
Telephone to the Gaiety Theatre at once.
Ask for the address of Carlotta Adams.

661
00:41:49,637 --> 00:41:51,630
Tout de sulte! Every minute is of value.

662
00:41:51,723 --> 00:41:55,769
- What's the matter? I don't understand.
- Hastings, do you not see?

663
00:41:56,729 --> 00:41:58,521
But I have been so slow!

664
00:41:58,607 --> 00:42:00,398
Imbécile!

665
00:42:08,243 --> 00:42:10,533
- How much, driver?
- One and five.

666
00:42:10,621 --> 00:42:14,121
I only hope we are in time. Vite! Vite, mon ami!

667
00:42:24,054 --> 00:42:25,050
Yes?

668
00:42:25,139 --> 00:42:27,216
Mademoiselle...

669
00:42:27,308 --> 00:42:30,144
- You are the maid of Miss Carlotta Adams?
- Yes.

670
00:42:30,229 --> 00:42:32,899
We must speak most urgently to your mistress.

671
00:42:32,982 --> 00:42:36,601
She's still in bed. She always gets up late
when there's a performance.

672
00:42:36,695 --> 00:42:39,068
So, you have spoken with her today?

673
00:42:39,156 --> 00:42:42,656
- No, she's asleep.
- Quick, mademoiselle, we must see her.

674
00:42:50,587 --> 00:42:52,497
Miss Adams!

675
00:42:55,176 --> 00:42:56,801
Miss Adams!

676
00:43:01,392 --> 00:43:02,934
It's locked!

677
00:43:03,019 --> 00:43:05,973
You must call at once for the police,
mademoiselle.

678
00:43:06,064 --> 00:43:07,523
Hastings.

679
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:19,033
Mademoiselle?

680
00:43:25,588 --> 00:43:27,083
We're too late.

681
00:43:43,151 --> 00:43:45,904
Sounds like an overdose to me, Poirot.

682
00:43:45,988 --> 00:43:48,859
- Veronal, or something of the sort.
- The sleeping draught?

683
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:52,154
- Of course, it could have been accidental.
- No, I think not.

684
00:43:52,246 --> 00:43:57,538
So you're saying that Carlotta Adams went
to Regent Gate disguised as Lady Edgware?

685
00:43:57,627 --> 00:44:02,124
And then had to be silenced to make sure
the identlty of her employer remained secret.

686
00:44:02,216 --> 00:44:05,384
So the idea was to frame Lady Edgware
from the very start?

687
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:06,846
Yes, Chief Inspector.

688
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:10,596
To ensure that she was hanged
fo ra murder she did not commit.

689
00:44:10,685 --> 00:44:12,345
I don't see it, Poirot.

690
00:44:12,437 --> 00:44:13,635
Non.

691
00:44:14,648 --> 00:44:16,440
Then let me show you.

692
00:44:23,033 --> 00:44:24,907
The wig, Chief Inspector.

693
00:44:24,994 --> 00:44:27,320
That's the same colour and style as...

694
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:29,490
Lady Edgware, yes.

695
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:32,335
And now, Chief Inspector...
Excuse me, Hastings.

696
00:44:40,346 --> 00:44:41,426
The shoes.

697
00:44:41,514 --> 00:44:43,887
Designed to increase the height.

698
00:44:47,522 --> 00:44:50,357
The make-up of a theatrical variety.

699
00:44:53,779 --> 00:44:55,440
And these.

700
00:44:56,825 --> 00:44:58,403
Pince-nez.

701
00:44:58,493 --> 00:45:01,163
With the lenses very strong.

702
00:45:01,026 --> 00:45:04,244
- But these were not part of the disguise.
- If there was a disguise.

703
00:45:04,337 --> 00:45:08,353
She was a performer, Poirot.
All this could be part of her act.

704
00:45:11,754 --> 00:45:13,339
And this?

705
00:45:20,386 --> 00:45:22,770
Veronal. Just like I thought.

706
00:45:24,493 --> 00:45:26,626
"CA from P.

707
00:45:26,714 --> 00:45:28,550
Sweet dreams,

708
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:30,059
November 10th."

709
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:31,485
November?

710
00:45:31,575 --> 00:45:33,041
That's seven months ago.

711
00:45:33,126 --> 00:45:36,057
There we are, then.
That proves she was taking the stuff.

712
00:45:36,143 --> 00:45:37,560
Perhaps.

713
00:45:39,118 --> 00:45:40,834
And yet...

714
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,636
Let's talk to the maid.

715
00:45:45,488 --> 00:45:47,787
Mademoiselle Alice, can you relate to us

716
00:45:47,876 --> 00:45:50,295
the movements of your mistress
yesterday evening?

717
00:45:51,606 --> 00:45:55,288
Well, she got here at about six o'clock.

718
00:45:56,509 --> 00:45:58,392
I don't know where she'd been.

719
00:45:58,479 --> 00:45:59,944
Yes, go on.

720
00:46:01,202 --> 00:46:03,752
She spent some time writing a letter.

721
00:46:04,764 --> 00:46:08,781
Then she got changed,
and left here at about seven o'clock.

722
00:46:08,871 --> 00:46:10,671
Did you know her destination?

723
00:46:10,757 --> 00:46:12,557
She didn't say.

724
00:46:12,643 --> 00:46:14,060
Did she go to the theatre?

725
00:46:14,151 --> 00:46:16,701
No, sir, there was no performance last night.

726
00:46:16,791 --> 00:46:19,210
And how was she dressed, mademoiselle?

727
00:46:20,269 --> 00:46:22,021
She was in black, sir.

728
00:46:22,113 --> 00:46:23,698
With a new hat.

729
00:46:25,633 --> 00:46:27,683
With a brim that was...slanting?

730
00:46:27,771 --> 00:46:28,939
Yes.

731
00:46:29,028 --> 00:46:31,161
She only bought it last week.

732
00:46:34,727 --> 00:46:36,645
From her friend, Miss Driver.

733
00:46:36,738 --> 00:46:38,955
Oh, Miss Penny Driver?

734
00:46:39,043 --> 00:46:40,759
We met her at the Gaiety Theatre.

735
00:46:40,845 --> 00:46:42,096
Oui.

736
00:46:42,982 --> 00:46:44,782
She got back around midnight.

737
00:46:46,712 --> 00:46:49,215
She said she was very tired.

738
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:52,110
But not upset or distressed?

739
00:46:52,201 --> 00:46:54,585
No, she seemed more...

740
00:46:54,674 --> 00:46:56,474
pleased about something.

741
00:46:57,901 --> 00:47:00,583
Anyway, then she went straight to bed.

742
00:47:00,666 --> 00:47:03,134
And this letter of which you spoke?

743
00:47:03,223 --> 00:47:05,309
It was to her sister, sir.

744
00:47:05,402 --> 00:47:08,119
Lucie Adams. She's over on a visit.

745
00:47:09,048 --> 00:47:11,384
Miss Carlotta took it with her when she left.

746
00:47:11,478 --> 00:47:13,611
She was going to post it, I suppose.

747
00:47:13,699 --> 00:47:16,082
Then she forgot. She was always doing that.

748
00:47:18,434 --> 00:47:21,366
And...where is this letter now?

749
00:47:21,452 --> 00:47:23,585
It's gone, I'm afraid, sir.

750
00:47:24,469 --> 00:47:26,518
I posted it myself this morning.

751
00:47:26,606 --> 00:47:28,524
She left it on the table.

752
00:47:30,629 --> 00:47:32,678
Then once again we are too late.

753
00:47:36,726 --> 00:47:41,146
Do you really think that
somebody paid Carlotta to imitate me?

754
00:47:41,237 --> 00:47:43,815
To go to the house, dressed like me?

755
00:47:43,911 --> 00:47:45,657
That is how it would appear, madame.

756
00:47:46,584 --> 00:47:49,162
But...she didn't kill my husband?

757
00:47:49,257 --> 00:47:52,346
No, no, no. It was enough
that she was seen there.

758
00:47:52,432 --> 00:47:57,101
No, somebody believed that you had a motive
to be rid of Lord Edgware.

759
00:47:57,194 --> 00:48:00,614
They believed also
that you would be at home, on your own.

760
00:48:01,579 --> 00:48:03,124
With no alibi.

761
00:48:04,587 --> 00:48:06,713
They wanted to see me hang.

762
00:48:10,769 --> 00:48:12,146
Madame.

763
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,811
Which is why I must ask you,

764
00:48:15,907 --> 00:48:18,366
who is it, you think, who would wish you ill?

765
00:48:20,083 --> 00:48:22,495
You're asking who would want to see me dead.

766
00:48:24,261 --> 00:48:26,552
It's horrible to think there could be anyone.

767
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:31,278
Do I really have to name names, Mr Poirot?

768
00:48:31,362 --> 00:48:33,321
If I am to protect you, oui.

769
00:48:35,956 --> 00:48:37,072
Well...

770
00:48:38,629 --> 00:48:41,124
I suppose Geraldine never liked me.

771
00:48:42,013 --> 00:48:44,935
After all, her father left her mother to marry me,

772
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:47,562
and you know her mother later died.

773
00:48:48,362 --> 00:48:50,239
It hasn't been easy for her.

774
00:48:51,662 --> 00:48:53,039
Tell me...

775
00:48:53,124 --> 00:48:55,749
what of Monsieur Brian Martin?

776
00:48:57,969 --> 00:48:59,382
Why do you mention him?

777
00:49:02,062 --> 00:49:04,902
We were lovers, Mr Poirot.

778
00:49:04,987 --> 00:49:09,370
For a short while, after I knew
my marriage had fallen apart.

779
00:49:10,793 --> 00:49:14,083
I was so unhappy and I turned to him.

780
00:49:15,429 --> 00:49:17,971
And then you met someone else?

781
00:49:20,149 --> 00:49:22,109
That's always been my trouble.

782
00:49:22,196 --> 00:49:24,524
I fall in love too easily.

783
00:49:25,371 --> 00:49:28,578
First, George, and that was a horrible mistake.

784
00:49:29,714 --> 00:49:31,591
Then Brian.

785
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:33,258
And now Percy.

786
00:49:33,349 --> 00:49:34,678
The Duke of Merton?

787
00:49:34,768 --> 00:49:37,097
But this time, I know I've got it right.

788
00:49:37,191 --> 00:49:42,490
He really is so sweet and kind
and he needs someone to look after him.

789
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:45,621
He and I plan to marry as soon as we can.

790
00:49:45,713 --> 00:49:47,090
And you'll be invited.

791
00:49:47,174 --> 00:49:49,966
Ah, the grand wedding.

792
00:49:50,056 --> 00:49:51,636
At Westminster, yes.

793
00:49:51,727 --> 00:49:53,354
That's what he's always wanted.

794
00:49:54,442 --> 00:49:57,697
I just fear all of this business will frighten him off.

795
00:49:57,783 --> 00:49:59,945
He so hates scandal.

796
00:50:01,418 --> 00:50:03,329
Mr Poirot...

797
00:50:03,423 --> 00:50:05,502
will you talk to him?

798
00:50:05,595 --> 00:50:08,386
Will you tell him
that everything's going to be all right?

799
00:50:10,942 --> 00:50:13,863
Once again,
you make of Poirot the ambassador.

800
00:50:13,949 --> 00:50:16,907
He's coming to my apartment later.

801
00:50:16,998 --> 00:50:18,792
You could meet him there.

802
00:50:21,509 --> 00:50:22,674
Oui.

803
00:50:23,681 --> 00:50:26,603
I knew I could trust you the moment I met you.

804
00:50:27,942 --> 00:50:30,947
You really are my guardian angel.

805
00:50:31,032 --> 00:50:33,075
I should be afraid.

806
00:50:33,163 --> 00:50:34,825
But I'm not.

807
00:50:34,917 --> 00:50:36,628
Not while you're here.

808
00:50:37,549 --> 00:50:39,545
Do not be anxious, madam.

809
00:50:39,638 --> 00:50:41,264
All will be arranged.

810
00:50:42,436 --> 00:50:43,980
You have my word.

811
00:51:10,004 --> 00:51:14,055
These are some of our latest models,
just in from Paris.

812
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:15,470
Oh, lovely.

813
00:51:16,353 --> 00:51:20,356
Dorothy, show Mrs Lester
the Rose Descartes model.

814
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:21,907
Excuse me.

815
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:34,012
- What are you doing here?
- It's not working out as we thought it would.

816
00:51:34,106 --> 00:51:36,101
- What do you mean?
- I've just seen Jane.

817
00:51:36,194 --> 00:51:39,782
- She hasn't been arrested?
- She was in the park, with Poirot.

818
00:51:39,870 --> 00:51:40,987
What?

819
00:51:41,081 --> 00:51:43,872
The way they were walking together,
you could imagine...

820
00:51:43,963 --> 00:51:45,757
She's got him lapping at her feet.

821
00:51:45,843 --> 00:51:49,051
So I think you can take it
she's more or less off the suspects list.

822
00:51:53,737 --> 00:51:55,567
It's all right, Brian.

823
00:51:56,411 --> 00:51:58,322
It's early days.

824
00:51:58,416 --> 00:52:01,921
She's going to get what she deserves
and she's not going to hurt us again.

753
00:52:09,733 --> 00:52:14,167
I'm sorry, Chief Inspector,
Mr Poirot went out first thing this morning.

754
00:52:14,259 --> 00:52:18,061
Don't tell me he's still got this bee
in his bonnet about Lady Edgware?

755
00:52:18,156 --> 00:52:21,672
That somebody deliberately set out
to frame her for her husband's murder?

756
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,261
Well, it is still a possibility.

757
00:52:23,352 --> 00:52:26,653
I don't know how, but it seems
she's got him round her little finger.

758
00:52:26,747 --> 00:52:29,715
- Maybe that's the sort of woman she is.
- I wouldn't say that.

759
00:52:29,806 --> 00:52:34,490
I've never thought of women as the manipulative
sex. Certainly not in my experience.

760
00:52:34,583 --> 00:52:37,551
Anyway, Chief Inspector,
aren't you forgetting something?

761
00:52:37,642 --> 00:52:41,110
Lady Edgware was at dinner
when the murder was being committed.

762
00:52:41,204 --> 00:52:45,435
No, I haven't forgotten that, Miss Lemon.
It looks like she's off the hook.

763
00:52:46,568 --> 00:52:52,265
However, you can drive from Holborn
to Regent's Gate in five minutes.

764
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:54,151
I've just done it myself.

765
00:52:54,237 --> 00:52:56,405
So if she had the car waiting outside...

766
00:52:56,500 --> 00:53:00,182
Donald Ross said she wasn't away
from the table for more than a few minutes.

767
00:53:00,271 --> 00:53:02,523
Well, maybe he lost track of the time.

768
00:53:02,618 --> 00:53:05,300
Do you have no other suspects,
Chief Inspector?

769
00:53:05,384 --> 00:53:07,969
Oh, I've got plenty of suspects, Miss Lemon.

770
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:12,502
Ronald Marsh, for example,
Lord Edgware's nephew.

771
00:53:12,591 --> 00:53:15,094
Atheatrical producer, heavily in debt.

772
00:53:15,189 --> 00:53:17,871
He needed the money, not to mention the title.

773
00:53:17,955 --> 00:53:21,305
Well, there you are, then.
Money's the oldest motive in the book.

774
00:53:21,391 --> 00:53:23,894
Then there's Geraldine Marsh, the daughter,

775
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:26,958
whose mother died
after Lord Edgware abandoned her.

776
00:53:27,049 --> 00:53:30,434
She told us to our face
how much she disliked her father.

777
00:53:30,527 --> 00:53:32,362
So it could have been either of them.

778
00:53:32,455 --> 00:53:33,920
Yes.

779
00:53:34,005 --> 00:53:36,091
But who was the real target?

780
00:53:36,184 --> 00:53:38,233
That's what beats me.

781
00:53:38,321 --> 00:53:40,371
Lord Edgware...

782
00:53:40,459 --> 00:53:42,461
or Lady Edgware?

855
00:53:45,365 --> 00:53:47,694
Can I take your hat, sir?

856
00:53:48,875 --> 00:53:50,455
Thank you, Alice.

857
00:53:50,546 --> 00:53:52,043
Jane, darling.

858
00:53:55,644 --> 00:53:58,020
Mr Poirot, it's a pleasure to meet you.

859
00:53:58,108 --> 00:54:00,651
- Monsieur le Duc.
- Jane has spoken a lot about you.

860
00:54:00,741 --> 00:54:04,246
- Would you like a drink, darling? Tea or coffee?
- No, I can't stay long.

861
00:54:04,334 --> 00:54:09,551
This business, the death of Lord Edgware,
it really is the most terrible thing.

862
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:12,183
That Jane should be involved.

863
00:54:12,272 --> 00:54:14,234
You know I'm relying on you?

864
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,447
We're both relying on you to sort it out.

865
00:54:16,535 --> 00:54:19,209
And if there's anything I can do to help...

866
00:54:19,292 --> 00:54:23,511
You could perhaps tell to me
how it was that the two of you met?

867
00:54:23,596 --> 00:54:26,056
It was at the theatre.

868
00:54:26,896 --> 00:54:29,986
Macbeth. A wonderful performance.

869
00:54:30,072 --> 00:54:31,450
Quite wonderful.

870
00:54:32,662 --> 00:54:34,658
Lord Edgware was there that night,

871
00:54:34,752 --> 00:54:36,914
and I saw how he behaved.

872
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:39,556
He was a brute of a man.

873
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:41,101
Despicable.

874
00:54:41,186 --> 00:54:44,108
I can't help but think
that he deserved what he got...

875
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:47,192
although that's a terrible thing to say.

876
00:54:47,286 --> 00:54:50,376
I won't lie to you, Mr Poirot.

877
00:54:50,462 --> 00:54:52,458
I'm glad at the way things worked out.

878
00:54:52,550 --> 00:54:55,343
And as soon as there's been a decent interval,

879
00:54:55,434 --> 00:54:57,561
Jane and I plan to be married.

880
00:54:57,648 --> 00:54:59,394
If she'll have me.

881
00:55:00,322 --> 00:55:01,819
Of course I will.

882
00:55:01,910 --> 00:55:03,953
I wish to you both...

883
00:55:04,041 --> 00:55:06,120
much happiness.

884
00:55:07,258 --> 00:55:09,551
I hope we'll see you at the cathedral, Mr Poirot.

885
00:55:10,726 --> 00:55:12,520
I know how you've taken Jane's side.

886
00:55:12,606 --> 00:55:14,817
And I want you to know
how much I appreciate it.

887
00:55:14,904 --> 00:55:17,150
Monsieur, madame.

888
00:55:23,009 --> 00:55:25,969
Alton, what are you doing?

889
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:28,057
What does it look like?

890
00:55:29,486 --> 00:55:32,742
Come on, Joyce. Why don't you
come down off your high horse for once?

891
00:55:32,828 --> 00:55:34,871
The master is dead,

892
00:55:34,959 --> 00:55:37,420
and you and me, we'll soon be for the hook.

893
00:55:37,509 --> 00:55:40,003
Everything will continue as before.

894
00:55:40,099 --> 00:55:42,475
Mr Ronald will move in.

895
00:55:42,564 --> 00:55:44,227
He's the new Lord Edgware now.

896
00:55:44,318 --> 00:55:46,897
Will you fancy him
as much as you did the old one?

897
00:55:46,993 --> 00:55:49,119
I will not listen to this.

898
00:55:49,207 --> 00:55:50,787
Have they arrested her yet?

899
00:55:50,878 --> 00:55:52,424
Lady Edgware?

900
00:55:53,803 --> 00:55:56,133
Apparently, the police don't believe it was her.

901
00:55:56,226 --> 00:55:57,557
What?

902
00:55:57,647 --> 00:56:01,069
They think there might have been
quite a different motive for the murder.

903
00:56:01,992 --> 00:56:03,490
Oh, hell.

904
00:56:08,511 --> 00:56:09,888
Alton?

905
00:56:09,973 --> 00:56:11,089
Alton!

906
00:56:19,416 --> 00:56:22,208
- Has he said anything?
- No, Captain Hastings.

907
00:56:23,469 --> 00:56:25,798
I think you'd better go and talk to him.

908
00:56:27,104 --> 00:56:29,147
I've never seen him like this.

909
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:38,092
Poirot?

910
00:56:45,864 --> 00:56:47,610
Are you all right?

911
00:56:47,702 --> 00:56:50,543
Oui. Ça va, ça va.

912
00:56:51,923 --> 00:56:54,084
She really has rather got to you, hasn't she?

913
00:56:54,178 --> 00:56:58,230
You reach a certain age,
you think romance has passed you by.

914
00:56:58,315 --> 00:57:00,525
When it does finally hit you,

915
00:57:00,613 --> 00:57:02,489
it really bowls you over.

916
00:57:02,576 --> 00:57:04,490
What is it of which you speak?

917
00:57:04,582 --> 00:57:05,865
Well, Jane Wilkinson.

918
00:57:09,637 --> 00:57:11,099
Hastings...

919
00:57:12,145 --> 00:57:16,399
..I think of the murder of Lord Edgware and
the questions to which there remain no answers.

920
00:57:16,490 --> 00:57:19,033
I think of the letter from Carlotta Adams
to her sister

921
00:57:19,122 --> 00:57:20,917
and the pince-nez we found in her bag.

922
00:57:21,003 --> 00:57:24,758
But absolutely not
do I think of Jane Wilkinson.

923
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:27,720
Very well. If you say so.

924
00:57:27,813 --> 00:57:29,559
Mr Poirot!

925
00:57:30,487 --> 00:57:32,817
That was Chief Inspector Japp.

926
00:57:32,911 --> 00:57:34,657
There's been a development.

927
00:57:36,170 --> 00:57:39,259
Mr Trabshaw, the solicitor,
unlocked it this morning.

928
00:57:39,345 --> 00:57:41,258
No-one else had the combination.

929
00:57:41,351 --> 00:57:43,561
I felt I should call you straight away.

930
00:57:43,649 --> 00:57:46,226
The French francs,
they are nowhere to be found?

931
00:57:46,323 --> 00:57:48,069
How many francs are we talking about?

932
00:57:48,161 --> 00:57:50,240
Well, a considerable amount.

933
00:57:50,334 --> 00:57:52,794
Lord Edgware was about to leave for Paris.

934
00:57:52,883 --> 00:57:55,259
He told the butler, Alton, to call the bank.

935
00:57:55,347 --> 00:57:57,010
And where is Alton?

936
00:57:57,102 --> 00:57:59,479
Well, that's why I called you, Chief Inspector.

937
00:57:59,568 --> 00:58:03,275
He seemed very agitated yesterday
when I told him you hadn't yet made an arrest.

938
00:58:03,370 --> 00:58:06,911
And this morning, he's failed to appear for work.

939
00:58:07,005 --> 00:58:09,001
I've been to his room and it's empty.

940
00:58:09,094 --> 00:58:10,971
He's gone.

941
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:20,454
It's one and six, please, madam.

942
00:58:21,461 --> 00:58:22,875
Thank you, madam.

943
00:58:47,408 --> 00:58:48,405
Yes?

944
00:58:48,494 --> 00:58:50,241
I'm here to see Carlotta.

945
00:58:50,333 --> 00:58:51,746
I'm sorry?

946
00:58:51,837 --> 00:58:53,418
She's expectating me.

947
00:58:53,508 --> 00:58:55,588
I'm Lucie Adams. I'm her sister.

948
00:58:55,681 --> 00:58:58,057
Haven't you heard?

949
00:58:58,939 --> 00:59:00,140
What?

950
00:59:13,856 --> 00:59:15,899
Thank you, Hastings.

951
00:59:18,869 --> 00:59:20,450
Mademoiselle Driver.

952
00:59:20,542 --> 00:59:23,167
I didn't know if I should call you, Mr Poirot.

953
00:59:23,257 --> 00:59:26,549
But Lucie insisted,
when she heard you were on the case.

954
00:59:26,641 --> 00:59:30,860
- Where is she now, mademoiselle?
- Upstairs. She had a terrible shock.

955
00:59:30,945 --> 00:59:34,450
Well, perhaps she came to you
because you were the friend of her sister?

956
00:59:34,538 --> 00:59:39,969
Yes. Carlotta was one of my first customers.
She bought all her hats here.

957
00:59:40,054 --> 00:59:45,305
I understand that you sold to her
a hat with a brim that is slanting?

958
00:59:45,401 --> 00:59:46,684
Well, similar to this one.

959
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:50,071
Yes, she bought one very like it last week.

960
00:59:50,165 --> 00:59:53,671
Mademoiselle,
did you ever make to her a present?

961
00:59:55,012 --> 00:59:57,471
A little box for the sleeping drug?

962
01:00:00,944 --> 01:00:03,024
- I'm sorry?
- You will see...

963
01:00:03,117 --> 01:00:05,612
"CA from P.

964
01:00:05,708 --> 01:00:08,382
Sweet dreams. November 10th."

965
01:00:08,465 --> 01:00:12,517
The CA is Carlotta.
We wondered if the P might be Penny.

966
01:00:12,602 --> 01:00:14,349
Well, it's not.

967
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:16,520
I've never seen that before.

968
01:00:17,699 --> 01:00:23,130
Merci. There is only one other question
I wish to ask you, mademoiselle.

969
01:00:23,214 --> 01:00:25,757
How well acquainted are you
with Jane Wilkinson?

970
01:00:26,778 --> 01:00:27,966
Jane?

971
01:00:28,110 --> 01:00:30,145
Why do you want to know about her?

972
01:00:33,310 --> 01:00:35,299
There was a man I was very close to,

973
01:00:35,391 --> 01:00:37,675
and she took him away from me.

974
01:00:37,762 --> 01:00:41,704
And when she finished with him,
she threw him over.

975
01:00:41,799 --> 01:00:45,573
There's nothing good
I can say about Jane Wilkinson.

976
01:00:47,042 --> 01:00:49,656
But I thought it was Lucie Adams
you'd come to see.

977
01:00:49,747 --> 01:00:52,029
And if you don't mind, she's waiting upstairs.

978
01:00:56,320 --> 01:01:00,604
It couldn't have been an overdose.
Carlotta never took drugs. She hated them.

979
01:01:01,937 --> 01:01:04,009
- It's all right.
- Mademoiselle...

980
01:01:04,101 --> 01:01:07,095
Can you explain to me
the reason for your visit to England?

981
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:09,925
Well, I came to see Carlotta.

982
01:01:10,009 --> 01:01:11,713
She invited me.

983
01:01:12,672 --> 01:01:15,536
The show was doing well
and she was so full of hope.

984
01:01:17,832 --> 01:01:21,772
I wanted to see a bit of the country
before I joined her in London.

985
01:01:21,867 --> 01:01:25,063
Since your arrival in England, mademoiselle,

986
01:01:25,155 --> 01:01:28,515
have you received a letter from your sister?

987
01:01:28,608 --> 01:01:30,228
Yes.

988
01:01:30,314 --> 01:01:33,426
I have it here. It arrived this morning.

989
01:01:33,519 --> 01:01:34,511
Ah!

990
01:01:35,598 --> 01:01:38,261
You permit that we read this letter,
mademoiselle?

991
01:01:39,384 --> 01:01:41,088
Yes, of course.

992
01:01:51,409 --> 01:01:53,148
"Dear little sister,

993
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:56,436
I'm sorry this is so scrappy
but things have been rather busy.

994
01:01:56,527 --> 01:01:59,556
The show is a success. Notices splendid.
Box office good."

995
01:01:59,647 --> 01:02:01,885
The whole of the first page is about the show.

996
01:02:03,517 --> 01:02:05,256
Oh, yes, it continues here.

997
01:02:05,347 --> 01:02:07,500
"I met Ronald Marsh the other night.

998
01:02:07,595 --> 01:02:11,796
He's a theatre producer. He tried to persuade
me to come in on one of his new shows.

999
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:16,118
I don't know, though. He drinks quite heavily
and has no money of his own,

1000
01:02:16,207 --> 01:02:19,036
although it turns out
he's the nephew of Lord Edgware,

1001
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:21,321
who sounds no beauty, I can tell you.

1002
01:02:21,409 --> 01:02:23,645
Anyway, Ronald loved my revue

1003
01:02:23,738 --> 01:02:27,348
and he asked me if I'd be interested
in earning some money

1004
01:02:27,441 --> 01:02:31,016
for a practical joke that would prove
just how good I was.

1005
01:02:31,103 --> 01:02:33,505
I laughed and said, 'How much?'

1006
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:38,168
Lucie, darling, the answer
fairly took my breath away. $2,000.

1007
01:02:38,259 --> 01:02:42,626
After that, we laid our heads together
and got down to details.

1008
01:02:42,711 --> 01:02:44,913
I'll tell you how it went when you get to London.

1009
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,077
I can't wait to see you, little sister mine. Yours..."

1010
01:02:48,162 --> 01:02:50,316
Carlotta.

1011
01:02:50,408 --> 01:02:52,149
There, there.

1012
01:02:53,987 --> 01:02:55,608
I don't understand.

1013
01:02:55,693 --> 01:03:00,345
Why would Ronald Marsh pay Carlotta
that sort of money?

1014
01:03:01,769 --> 01:03:06,419
And where would he get it from?
I mean, everyone knew he was virtually broke.

1015
01:03:06,512 --> 01:03:09,043
That is indeed the question.

1016
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,288
Mademoiselle...

1017
01:03:14,125 --> 01:03:16,906
..you will allow us to guard
this letter for a little while?

1018
01:03:18,162 --> 01:03:19,190
Yes.

1019
01:03:20,450 --> 01:03:22,651
If it will help, Mr Poirot.

1020
01:03:22,739 --> 01:03:24,193
Merci.

1021
01:03:25,984 --> 01:03:27,806
Courage, mademoiselle.

1022
01:03:27,899 --> 01:03:32,301
I will return this letter to you and, with it,
the truth concerning the death of your sister.

1023
01:03:33,723 --> 01:03:36,291
- You have the word of Poirot.
- Thank you.

1024
01:03:41,296 --> 01:03:43,249
Well, this is it, Poirot.

1025
01:03:43,335 --> 01:03:46,245
The proof of the pudding.
It was Ronald Marsh all the time.

1026
01:03:46,331 --> 01:03:48,945
You no longer suspect Alton the butler?

1027
01:03:49,034 --> 01:03:52,148
No, no. He's obviously up to no good,
but he's no killer.

1028
01:03:52,239 --> 01:03:53,943
No, no, it's all here.

1029
01:03:54,028 --> 01:03:59,057
Ronald Marsh hired Carlotta Adams to go
to Regent Gate disguised as Lady Edgware.

1030
01:03:59,146 --> 01:04:02,506
Later on, he killed Lord Edgware,
making us think that she'd done it.

1031
01:04:02,599 --> 01:04:06,208
Then, of course, Carlotta had to die
to stop her talking.

1032
01:04:06,302 --> 01:04:09,296
But, of course, at the time of the first murder,

1033
01:04:09,381 --> 01:04:11,250
Monsieur Ronald Marsh was at the opera.

1034
01:04:11,337 --> 01:04:13,242
According to Geraldine Marsh, yes.

1035
01:04:14,374 --> 01:04:16,859
But there's something you don't know, Poirot.

1036
01:04:20,366 --> 01:04:23,856
I was thinking about
Ronald Marsh's so-called alibi.

1037
01:04:23,944 --> 01:04:27,435
- And then I had an idea.
- I congratulate you, Chief Inspector.

1038
01:04:27,522 --> 01:04:28,634
Thank you.

1039
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:32,669
It occurred to me that Regent Gate is
less than a mile away from Covent Garden.

1040
01:04:32,765 --> 01:04:35,428
- Do you get my drift?
- He could have left in an interval?

1041
01:04:35,511 --> 01:04:37,499
Yes, and been back in time for the next act.

1042
01:04:37,591 --> 01:04:40,585
Ah, yes. Now, that, I believe,
is the same technique you used

1043
01:04:40,670 --> 01:04:43,202
to demonstrate the possible guilt
of Jane Wilkinson.

1044
01:04:43,292 --> 01:04:47,149
That's right. I've been talking
to quite a few of the taxi drivers in this area,

1045
01:04:47,245 --> 01:04:49,646
and this time I came up trumps.

1046
01:04:49,742 --> 01:04:54,687
Ronald Marsh and the young lady left Covent
Garden between the second and the third act.

1047
01:04:54,776 --> 01:04:58,219
The driver took them to Regent Gate
and waited for them outside.

1048
01:04:58,312 --> 01:04:59,555
Good Lord.

1049
01:04:59,643 --> 01:05:01,632
Where is Monsieur Marsh?

1050
01:05:01,724 --> 01:05:03,002
In here.

1051
01:05:04,220 --> 01:05:05,960
All right.

1052
01:05:06,051 --> 01:05:07,708
Yes.

1053
01:05:07,798 --> 01:05:10,828
I did go to the house during the interval.

1054
01:05:10,919 --> 01:05:12,410
Talk to Geraldine.

1055
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:15,281
- And she was in the cab with you?
- Yes.

1056
01:05:15,371 --> 01:05:17,406
But she had nothing to do with it, either.

1057
01:05:19,033 --> 01:05:20,903
Why did you return to the house?

1058
01:05:20,988 --> 01:05:22,776
I needed money.

1059
01:05:23,568 --> 01:05:27,508
I met Geraldine at the opera
and, bless her, she agreed to help.

1060
01:05:27,604 --> 01:05:29,805
She offered you financial assistance?

1061
01:05:29,892 --> 01:05:33,419
She had some pearls
She said I could pawn them.

1062
01:05:33,513 --> 01:05:35,962
It would keep me afloat for a few more weeks.

1063
01:05:36,050 --> 01:05:38,582
And you went over to get them
in the middle of the opera?

1064
01:05:38,672 --> 01:05:41,157
Needs must, Chief Inspector.
It was urgent.

1065
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:45,991
She had a key, let herself in.
I waited outside.

1066
01:05:46,078 --> 01:05:49,072
I don't suppose you saw anything
while you were outside?

1067
01:05:49,157 --> 01:05:50,435
No.

1068
01:05:52,653 --> 01:05:54,392
Actually, there was something.

1069
01:05:54,482 --> 01:05:55,974
Wait.

1070
01:05:56,065 --> 01:05:59,259
Just as we got there,
I thought I saw Brian come out.

1071
01:05:59,351 --> 01:06:00,759
Brian Martin?

1072
01:06:00,850 --> 01:06:03,334
It was dark,
but it certainly looked like him.

1073
01:06:03,429 --> 01:06:05,665
You can ask Geraldine. She saw him, too.

1074
01:06:05,758 --> 01:06:07,498
That was Brian!

1075
01:06:09,045 --> 01:06:10,241
Monsieur Marsh,

1076
01:06:10,336 --> 01:06:13,778
when we first met, it was in the presence
of Carlotta Adams, the performer.

1077
01:06:13,873 --> 01:06:16,618
You said you were hoping
to engage her in the theatre.

1078
01:06:16,702 --> 01:06:17,779
Yes.

1079
01:06:17,866 --> 01:06:21,689
Subsequently, you paid to her
the sum of $2,000.

1080
01:06:21,778 --> 01:06:22,938
What?

1081
01:06:23,026 --> 01:06:25,014
What are you talking about?

1082
01:06:25,106 --> 01:06:28,135
- Are you denying it?
- Of course I am.

1083
01:06:28,228 --> 01:06:31,470
Where would I have got money like that?
Why should I pay her anything?

1084
01:06:31,556 --> 01:06:37,247
Mr Marsh, we have it on record from
Miss Adams herself that you paid her that sum.

1085
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:40,452
Well, if that's what she said, then she was lying.

1086
01:06:40,543 --> 01:06:42,578
I never paid her a bean.

1087
01:06:43,372 --> 01:06:45,988
Now, if you don't mind,
I should like to go home.

1088
01:06:48,532 --> 01:06:50,604
- He's going nowhere.
- Chief Inspector?

1089
01:06:50,695 --> 01:06:52,683
Not till I've spoken to Geraldine Marsh.

1090
01:06:52,775 --> 01:06:54,350
- Sir!
- Yes?

1091
01:06:57,519 --> 01:06:59,423
Ah, it's Alton, the missing butler.

1092
01:06:59,516 --> 01:07:02,877
He's been reported buying a ticket
for Buenos Aires, would you believe?

1093
01:07:02,970 --> 01:07:04,425
Flight leaving today.

1094
01:07:04,509 --> 01:07:07,456
That's the flight I took.
The first leg leaves for Paris at four.

1095
01:07:07,546 --> 01:07:10,162
We've just got time to intercept him. Come on.

1096
01:07:35,299 --> 01:07:37,963
He's heading for the terminal. Get after him!

1097
01:07:45,369 --> 01:07:47,735
- There he is!
- Stay where you are, Alton.

1098
01:07:49,821 --> 01:07:51,227
Wait here.

1099
01:07:54,938 --> 01:07:56,098
Argh!

1100
01:07:56,186 --> 01:07:58,968
We know you've got the money!
You won't get away with it!

1101
01:08:12,414 --> 01:08:14,448
Come on! This way!

1102
01:08:17,739 --> 01:08:20,402
Give yourself up, Alton.
You don't stand a chance.

1103
01:08:29,639 --> 01:08:31,130
After him!

1104
01:08:32,053 --> 01:08:33,508
Hold him!

1105
01:08:38,751 --> 01:08:40,029
- No!
- Argh!

1106
01:09:02,260 --> 01:09:04,827
- Bonjour, Hastings.
- Oh, morning, Poirot.

1107
01:09:05,755 --> 01:09:10,655
You had a telephone call earlier
from Ronald Marsh, Mr Poirot.

1108
01:09:10,747 --> 01:09:14,487
He rang to invite you today
to what he called a celebratory lunch.

1109
01:09:14,576 --> 01:09:17,190
- Japp must have released him already.
- Oui.

1110
01:09:17,281 --> 01:09:21,350
Mademoiselle Geraldine
must have corroborated his story.

1111
01:09:21,441 --> 01:09:24,140
Perhaps Alton did kill Lord Edgware afterall.

1112
01:09:24,229 --> 01:09:26,016
No, no, no, Hastings. I think not.

1113
01:09:26,101 --> 01:09:27,805
Well then, who did?

1114
01:09:30,845 --> 01:09:32,879
Five questions, Hastings.

1115
01:09:33,655 --> 01:09:35,484
That is all.

1116
01:09:37,410 --> 01:09:38,786
Five.

1117
01:09:41,250 --> 01:09:44,251
The answers to which will reveal to me the truth.

1118
01:09:44,337 --> 01:09:46,960
Five questions, Mr Poirot?

1119
01:09:47,050 --> 01:09:48,628
Fire away.

1120
01:09:49,761 --> 01:09:53,215
We know that Lord Edgware
changed his mind on the subject of divorce

1121
01:09:53,308 --> 01:09:55,848
and that he wrote to his wife
to acquaint her of that.

1122
01:09:55,937 --> 01:09:57,597
He sent it to the theatre.

1123
01:09:57,689 --> 01:10:00,775
Oui, and it was indeed posted by Miss Carroll.

1124
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:05,322
But why was it that this letter
was never received by Lady Edgware?

1125
01:10:06,786 --> 01:10:10,784
To whose interest was it
that this letter should not arrive?

1126
01:10:14,546 --> 01:10:16,289
What's the second question?

1127
01:10:16,382 --> 01:10:21,177
The telephone call that Lady Edgware
received at the dinnerat Holborn.

1128
01:10:22,306 --> 01:10:26,057
Assurément, it was to make sure
she was indeed there, but...

1129
01:10:27,439 --> 01:10:30,109
..who has made this telephone call and why?

1130
01:10:32,362 --> 01:10:34,403
I can't help you there.

1131
01:10:35,241 --> 01:10:37,947
What's the third question, Mr Poirot?

1132
01:10:38,037 --> 01:10:41,739
The third question, Miss Lemon,
concerns the pince-nez

1133
01:10:41,833 --> 01:10:45,785
that we discovered in the handbag
of Carlotta Adams.

1134
01:10:45,881 --> 01:10:50,878
Now, neither she nor Lady Edgware
wore spectacles such as these.

1135
01:10:50,971 --> 01:10:54,258
So what is their purpose
and to whom do they belong?

1136
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:56,510
That's a good question.

1137
01:10:56,604 --> 01:11:00,307
Next, we come to the letter
written by Carlotta Adams

1138
01:11:00,401 --> 01:11:02,359
to her sister.

1139
01:11:04,156 --> 01:11:08,285
In it, she says quite clearly that it was
Ronald Marsh who paid her $2,000,

1140
01:11:08,370 --> 01:11:10,447
but Monsieur Marsh, he denies this.

1141
01:11:10,541 --> 01:11:12,451
And it is true...

1142
01:11:12,543 --> 01:11:16,708
that he had in his possession
not such an amount.

1143
01:11:16,799 --> 01:11:18,839
So, are you saying Carlotta was lying?

1144
01:11:18,928 --> 01:11:24,469
No, but it is perhaps that she concealed
the true identity of her employer.

1145
01:11:25,979 --> 01:11:28,766
What's the fifth question, Mr Poirot?

1146
01:11:28,857 --> 01:11:30,851
Who is P?

1147
01:11:32,488 --> 01:11:35,524
You remember the box
given to Carlotta Adams?

1148
01:11:35,617 --> 01:11:36,993
"To CA from P"?

1149
01:11:37,077 --> 01:11:38,073
Oui.

1150
01:11:40,248 --> 01:11:42,537
Who was it that gave to her this box?

1151
01:11:43,962 --> 01:11:46,120
This I would like to know most dearly.

1152
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:50,884
What was the first question again, Poirot?

1153
01:11:53,391 --> 01:11:56,014
Actually, I may be able to help you, Mr Poirot.

1154
01:11:57,063 --> 01:11:59,222
My file on London jewellers.

1155
01:12:00,276 --> 01:12:03,480
A specialised piece like that
should be easy enough to track down.

1156
01:12:03,572 --> 01:12:05,695
Then, Miss Lemon, this I entrust to you.

1157
01:12:05,783 --> 01:12:07,028
Merci.

1158
01:12:10,999 --> 01:12:13,704
So, are you going to this lunch, Poirot?
Ronald Marsh?

1159
01:12:13,795 --> 01:12:18,090
No, no, no, Hastings.
I have work to do here in my apartment.

1160
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:20,846
No, you must be my eyes and my nose.

1161
01:12:20,929 --> 01:12:24,596
- Ears.
- Oui. To see and observe in my place.

1162
01:12:24,684 --> 01:12:27,177
Right. You can count on me.

1163
01:12:41,375 --> 01:12:42,537
Madam.

1164
01:13:13,084 --> 01:13:16,206
- Try Addison's, madam, on the right.
- Thank you very much.

1165
01:13:18,717 --> 01:13:20,676
I think you were sweet!

1166
01:13:20,762 --> 01:13:23,633
- Oh, Captain Hastings, do sit down.
- Thank you.

1167
01:13:24,892 --> 01:13:28,346
- Hello.
- Mr Poirot couldn't make it, then?

1168
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:30,017
No, I'm afraid he has to work.

1169
01:13:30,108 --> 01:13:33,230
Captain Hastings, is it true about Alton?

1170
01:13:33,322 --> 01:13:35,896
Yes, I'm afraid he died trying to make a run for it.

1171
01:13:35,991 --> 01:13:39,444
But the police don't think he was responsible
for Lord Edgware's death.

1172
01:13:39,539 --> 01:13:42,112
Well, I wish they'd find out whoever did it.

1173
01:13:42,208 --> 01:13:45,294
This whole thing is driving us mad.
It's suffocating us.

1174
01:13:45,380 --> 01:13:48,547
Don't worry. Mr Poirot won't give up.

1175
01:13:48,634 --> 01:13:49,749
I know he won't.

1176
01:13:49,844 --> 01:13:52,550
That's right. You know, he's never failed yet.

1177
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:55,844
I don't suppose you remember me,
Captain Hastings? I'm Donald Ross.

1178
01:13:55,935 --> 01:13:58,725
- We met at Sir Montagu's.
- Yes, of course. You're a writer.

1179
01:13:58,815 --> 01:14:00,227
A great writer.

1180
01:14:00,317 --> 01:14:04,779
I've just finished reading his first play,
The Trojan Wars. It's going to be a smash.

1181
01:14:04,865 --> 01:14:08,946
We're all here to celebrate
freedom and independence.

1182
01:14:09,037 --> 01:14:13,950
I suppose the toast ought to be to whoever did
kill him. He or she did us all a great favour.

1183
01:14:14,044 --> 01:14:15,075
No.

1184
01:14:15,171 --> 01:14:18,292
Oh, come on, Jane. You can't say
you weren't pleased to see him go?

1185
01:14:18,383 --> 01:14:19,759
No.

1186
01:14:19,844 --> 01:14:23,629
But any one of us sitting at this table
could have killed him.

1187
01:14:23,725 --> 01:14:26,014
And I won't drink to that.

1188
01:14:26,103 --> 01:14:27,681
I simply won't.

1189
01:14:28,814 --> 01:14:31,272
Oh, that one. That's just what I want.

1190
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:33,899
- Don't you like it?
- I suppose so.

1191
01:14:37,201 --> 01:14:39,076
Oh, good afternoon, madam.

1192
01:15:23,099 --> 01:15:26,598
Yes, this is definltely my work.
I recognise the inscription.

1193
01:15:26,687 --> 01:15:28,727
It was commissioned only a few weeks ago.

1194
01:15:28,814 --> 01:15:30,394
Only a few weeks ago?

1195
01:15:30,484 --> 01:15:34,399
But it's meant to be a souvenir
of something that happened in November.

1196
01:15:34,489 --> 01:15:38,535
- That's seven months.
- Yes, I wondered about that, too.

1197
01:15:38,620 --> 01:15:40,412
Can you tell me who ordered it?

1198
01:15:40,497 --> 01:15:41,696
Yes, er...

1199
01:15:41,791 --> 01:15:43,832
It was a lady.

1200
01:15:44,670 --> 01:15:46,128
Give me a moment.

1201
01:15:47,130 --> 01:15:48,505
Ah, here.

1202
01:15:48,589 --> 01:15:50,461
A Mrs Van Dusen.

1203
01:15:50,548 --> 01:15:51,958
Van Dusen?

1204
01:15:52,049 --> 01:15:55,463
Yes, an elderly lady, if I remember rightly.

1205
01:15:56,301 --> 01:15:57,580
Dressed in black.

1206
01:15:57,676 --> 01:15:59,336
With a fur cape.

1207
01:15:59,427 --> 01:16:01,336
Grey hair, I think.

1208
01:16:01,429 --> 01:16:03,503
Oh, yes, and she was wearing pince-nez.

1209
01:16:06,139 --> 01:16:09,837
Don't get me wrong.
I enjoyed Private Lives as much as anyone.

1210
01:16:09,932 --> 01:16:12,802
But Noel Coward is simply a passing fashion.

1211
01:16:12,892 --> 01:16:15,263
Light-hearted and instantly forgettable.

1212
01:16:15,352 --> 01:16:18,386
So, where do your passions lie, Mr Ross?

1213
01:16:18,478 --> 01:16:23,433
Well, at the moment, I have to say,
I am fascinated by the Judgement Of Paris.

1214
01:16:23,522 --> 01:16:26,771
But Paris doesn't have any judgement at all
when it comes to fashion.

1215
01:16:26,857 --> 01:16:30,556
These days, one has to look to Milan
and New York.

1216
01:16:32,068 --> 01:16:35,898
I was referring to the judgement
of the shepherd boy, Paris.

1217
01:16:35,986 --> 01:16:40,232
He gave the golden apple to Aphrodite
and so sparked off the war with Troy.

1218
01:16:40,322 --> 01:16:41,602
Oh.

1219
01:16:41,698 --> 01:16:43,819
That Paris.

1220
01:16:44,949 --> 01:16:47,735
Why do we have to talk about theatre
all of the time?

1221
01:16:47,826 --> 01:16:49,283
Percy, you must be bored rigid.

1222
01:16:49,368 --> 01:16:51,692
No, I could never be bored with you.

1223
01:16:51,786 --> 01:16:52,983
Paris...

1224
01:16:56,329 --> 01:16:57,871
Mrs Van Dusen?

1225
01:16:57,955 --> 01:17:00,742
You are sure of this name, Miss Lemon?

1226
01:17:00,832 --> 01:17:02,373
Absolutely, Mr Poirot.

1227
01:17:02,457 --> 01:17:06,204
Then this is the same lady
that Jane Wilkinson met here at this hotel

1228
01:17:06,293 --> 01:17:08,331
on the night that her husband was murdered.

1229
01:17:08,418 --> 01:17:11,205
Here we are, sir. Mrs Van Dusen.

1230
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:14,329
Room 174. She booked in for one night.

1231
01:17:14,421 --> 01:17:16,128
One night only?

1232
01:17:16,214 --> 01:17:18,206
Yes, sir.

1233
01:17:18,299 --> 01:17:23,172
Actually, I do remember her,
now I think about it. An American lady.

1234
01:17:23,259 --> 01:17:25,381
Elderly. She wore...

1235
01:17:25,469 --> 01:17:26,878
- Pince-nez.
- Yes.

1236
01:17:26,969 --> 01:17:29,008
I wouldn't remember her,

1237
01:17:29,095 --> 01:17:32,878
only the maid said the bed wasn't slept in,
which seemed odd at the time.

1238
01:17:32,973 --> 01:17:34,465
Oh, Poirot.

1239
01:17:34,556 --> 01:17:36,714
Ah, Hastings.

1240
01:17:36,807 --> 01:17:39,677
- How went the lunch?
- Oh, it went pretty well.

1241
01:17:39,767 --> 01:17:42,435
They were all there.
Brian Martin, Penny Driver,

1242
01:17:42,518 --> 01:17:44,843
Jane Wilkinson, and even the Duke of Merton.

1243
01:17:44,936 --> 01:17:47,556
Oh, and that writer chap,
Donald Ross, was there.

1244
01:17:47,646 --> 01:17:49,436
He asked you to telephone him.

1245
01:17:49,522 --> 01:17:51,181
Comment?

1246
01:17:51,273 --> 01:17:53,228
Yes, he seemed puzzled by something.

1247
01:17:53,315 --> 01:17:55,686
- He gave me his card.
- When was this, Hastings?

1248
01:17:55,775 --> 01:17:57,517
Half an hour ago.

1249
01:17:59,860 --> 01:18:03,062
And he asked me to telephone him
in front of all those people?

1250
01:18:03,153 --> 01:18:04,268
Yes.

1251
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:07,603
They have a telephone at the desk, Mr Poirot.

1252
01:18:07,697 --> 01:18:10,401
- May I use your telephone, please?
- Of course, sir.

1253
01:18:10,490 --> 01:18:11,735
Merci.

1254
01:18:25,872 --> 01:18:27,615
This is Donald Ross.

1255
01:18:27,707 --> 01:18:30,327
Ah, Mr Poirot. Thank you for calling.

1256
01:18:30,417 --> 01:18:32,040
I didn't want to bother you,

1257
01:18:32,125 --> 01:18:36,038
but there's something to me that seems
odd in connection with Lord Edgware's death.

1258
01:18:36,128 --> 01:18:38,414
It was Paris that set me off.

1259
01:18:38,503 --> 01:18:40,661
It suddenly got me thinking.

1260
01:18:40,754 --> 01:18:42,332
Just a moment.

1261
01:18:52,843 --> 01:18:55,334
Stabbed in the neck.
Same as Lord Edgware.

1262
01:18:55,428 --> 01:18:58,712
And it actually happened while he
was talking to you on the telephone?

1263
01:18:58,805 --> 01:19:02,219
Oui. But before he had time to explain
to me what he wished to say.

1264
01:19:05,891 --> 01:19:09,306
This is all my fault, Poirot.
If only I'd stayed with him.

1265
01:19:09,394 --> 01:19:10,970
Not at all, Hastings.

1266
01:19:12,353 --> 01:19:16,017
The fate of Monsieur Donald Ross, it was
settled the moment he spoke my name.

1267
01:19:16,105 --> 01:19:18,345
Someone at that lunch
must have overheard him,

1268
01:19:18,439 --> 01:19:20,063
followed him back here and then...

1269
01:19:20,148 --> 01:19:22,271
Yes, but which one of them was it?
And why?

1270
01:19:22,358 --> 01:19:25,523
I mean, this chap was just a writer.
A nobody.

1271
01:19:25,609 --> 01:19:27,601
How would he know anything about anything?

1272
01:19:27,694 --> 01:19:32,353
He managed to mention only...
the name of Paris.

1273
01:19:32,446 --> 01:19:34,023
Paris?

1274
01:19:36,781 --> 01:19:40,362
I think it must have triggered a memory
which until then had remained hidden.

1275
01:19:40,450 --> 01:19:42,690
Wasn't Lord Edgware going to Paris?

1276
01:19:42,784 --> 01:19:44,823
Didn't he say he was going to buy a painting?

1277
01:19:44,910 --> 01:19:46,783
Tell me, Hastings,

1278
01:19:46,870 --> 01:19:48,944
at that luncheon, who was the first to leave?

1279
01:19:49,037 --> 01:19:51,029
Er, Brian Martin...

1280
01:19:51,121 --> 01:19:53,612
and Penny Driver,

1281
01:19:53,706 --> 01:19:55,911
then Jane Wilkinson and the Duke of Merton.

1282
01:19:55,998 --> 01:19:59,746
No, wait a minute,
it was actually the other way round.

1283
01:20:03,877 --> 01:20:05,455
Sacré!

1284
01:20:05,545 --> 01:20:08,081
Oh, Hastings!

1285
01:20:08,171 --> 01:20:09,962
I have been so foolish.

1286
01:20:10,047 --> 01:20:12,122
And yet, it is so simple.

1287
01:20:13,341 --> 01:20:15,664
The five questions?

1288
01:20:15,758 --> 01:20:16,872
Yes?

1289
01:20:16,967 --> 01:20:18,924
The answers, Hastings,

1290
01:20:19,010 --> 01:20:21,416
they fall into place at last.

1291
01:20:27,597 --> 01:20:29,719
I'm afraid Lady Edgware isn't in, sir.

1292
01:20:29,807 --> 01:20:33,257
But it is not Lady Edgware
I have come to see, Mademoiselle Alice.

1293
01:20:34,225 --> 01:20:35,849
It is you.

1294
01:20:36,810 --> 01:20:38,636
I have here a letter,

1295
01:20:38,687 --> 01:20:42,516
and it would be of great interest to me
to know if you recognise the writing?

1296
01:20:43,396 --> 01:20:47,012
- I'll just need to fetch my glasses.
- You will permit me, mademoiselle?

1297
01:20:48,106 --> 01:20:49,101
Ah!

1298
01:20:57,358 --> 01:20:58,686
Oh, thank you, sir.

1299
01:21:06,736 --> 01:21:09,770
No, sir. I don't know this writing.
What made you think I would?

1300
01:21:09,861 --> 01:21:14,153
Vraiment, mademoiselle,
I knew that with certainty you would not.

1301
01:21:21,198 --> 01:21:24,611
And so, we return to where we began.

1302
01:21:25,866 --> 01:21:28,948
It was here,
during an evening of entertainment,

1303
01:21:29,033 --> 01:21:32,482
that I first met many of you,
who gather here again today.

1304
01:21:32,576 --> 01:21:37,151
But little did I know that that very same night,

1305
01:21:37,244 --> 01:21:41,654
a murder most ingenious, it was being planned.

1306
01:21:41,745 --> 01:21:44,614
Are you saying you know who killed him,
Mr Poirot?

1307
01:21:45,538 --> 01:21:47,031
Was it one of us?

1308
01:21:47,122 --> 01:21:48,401
Ah.

1309
01:21:52,373 --> 01:21:57,281
Each person here had the reason
to wish the death of Lord Edgware.

1310
01:21:57,374 --> 01:22:00,290
For Monsieur Ronald Marsh,
it was a question of money.

1311
01:22:00,375 --> 01:22:04,500
For Mademoiselle Geraldine, it was a chance
to be rid of a father that she loathed.

1312
01:22:04,584 --> 01:22:07,417
The Duke of Merton also knew
that the death of Lord Edgware

1313
01:22:07,502 --> 01:22:10,073
would allow him to marry the lady that he loved.

1314
01:22:10,169 --> 01:22:14,211
- Well, I had no reason to kill him.
- Au contraire, Monsieur Martin.

1315
01:22:14,296 --> 01:22:17,164
It is my belief that you had
 the greatest reason of all.

1316
01:22:17,254 --> 01:22:20,537
You were in love with Jane Wilkinson,
were you not?

1317
01:22:20,630 --> 01:22:22,870
- I don't really see that...
- It wasn't love!

1318
01:22:25,339 --> 01:22:27,378
It was infatuation.

1319
01:22:29,549 --> 01:22:31,208
Brian feels nothing for her now.

1320
01:22:31,300 --> 01:22:33,919
And you believe that
his feelings now are for you alone?

1321
01:22:34,009 --> 01:22:35,917
We're in love, yes.

1322
01:22:37,301 --> 01:22:39,506
We have been since the day we met.

1323
01:22:39,593 --> 01:22:43,090
And yet Jane Wilkinson stole him from you.
Ah, yes, mademoiselle.

1324
01:22:43,178 --> 01:22:45,750
Even now, you cannot speak
her name without the anger.

1325
01:22:45,845 --> 01:22:48,299
She is a woman you would be
glad to see hanged.

1326
01:22:48,388 --> 01:22:52,004
To murder Lord Edgware and then to
frame Jane Wilkinson for his death,

1327
01:22:52,097 --> 01:22:54,254
that would be revenge indeed.

1328
01:22:54,348 --> 01:22:56,339
No. I never thought of that.

1329
01:22:56,431 --> 01:22:57,629
Yes, you did!

1330
01:22:57,723 --> 01:23:01,303
Why else come to me with a cock-and-bull
story about a man with a gold tooth?

1331
01:23:01,391 --> 01:23:03,880
- What? It wasn't true?
- No, Hastings.

1332
01:23:03,975 --> 01:23:06,594
It was like something from the cinema.
I saw that at once.

1333
01:23:06,684 --> 01:23:08,556
But the real reason that you came to me,

1334
01:23:08,643 --> 01:23:11,511
that followed very soon.

1335
01:23:11,602 --> 01:23:13,972
Do you think she had it in her to commit murder?

1336
01:23:14,061 --> 01:23:16,385
I'm sure of it. I know her, you see.

1337
01:23:16,479 --> 01:23:19,477
I mean, she's terribly sweet on the surface.

1338
01:23:19,562 --> 01:23:24,221
But she would kill as easily
as drink her morning tea. Believe me.

1339
01:23:24,314 --> 01:23:27,846
You came to me to poison my mind
against Jane Wilkinson,

1340
01:23:27,939 --> 01:23:31,104
to impress upon me
the fact that she was a killer.

1341
01:23:31,190 --> 01:23:33,395
But you already knew Lord Edgware was dead.

1342
01:23:33,483 --> 01:23:35,639
And how did you know this, monsieur?

1343
01:23:35,733 --> 01:23:39,147
- Because you had killed him the night before.
- No, you've got it wrong.

1344
01:23:39,234 --> 01:23:42,268
Why must you lie to me?
You were seen leaving the house.

1345
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:43,439
Wait!

1346
01:23:43,528 --> 01:23:47,107
It was just before ten o'clock that
you were seen by Mr Ronald Marsh,

1347
01:23:47,195 --> 01:23:51,190
who had returned from the opera with
Mademoiselle Geraldine to retrieve a necklace.

1348
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:52,938
That was Brian.

1349
01:23:53,030 --> 01:23:55,519
No, you've got it wrong. It wasn't me.
For God's sake!

1350
01:23:55,614 --> 01:23:56,942
Enough.

1351
01:23:58,406 --> 01:24:00,278
You deny that you lied to me?

1352
01:24:01,574 --> 01:24:02,735
No.

1353
01:24:02,823 --> 01:24:06,486
All right, all that stuff about the gold tooth...

1354
01:24:06,575 --> 01:24:10,487
You're right about that.
I was trying to incriminate her.

1355
01:24:10,575 --> 01:24:11,606
What?

1356
01:24:15,993 --> 01:24:19,360
You're heartless, Jane. She is as cold as ice.

1357
01:24:19,453 --> 01:24:20,863
I loved you,

1358
01:24:20,954 --> 01:24:24,402
and you threw me over
without so much as a second thought.

1359
01:24:26,581 --> 01:24:30,195
Yes, I wanted to see her hang.

1360
01:24:31,123 --> 01:24:35,497
And in order to achieve that end, monsieur,
you attempted to deceive Hercule Poirot.

1361
01:24:35,582 --> 01:24:37,657
But I didn't kill him.

1362
01:24:37,749 --> 01:24:40,618
I never went near the house that night.

1363
01:24:41,751 --> 01:24:43,409
I heard the news the next day.

1364
01:24:43,501 --> 01:24:45,824
And that's when I had the idea.

1365
01:24:45,918 --> 01:24:47,875
I must have been mad.

1366
01:24:47,961 --> 01:24:49,537
Yes, indeed.

1367
01:24:49,628 --> 01:24:52,461
And for the attempt to deceive Hercule Poirot,

1368
01:24:52,545 --> 01:24:54,583
you have now been punished.

1369
01:24:58,172 --> 01:25:00,459
What? You mean, you know it wasn't me?

1370
01:25:02,172 --> 01:25:06,120
The person seen by Monsieur Ronald Marsh
was, I think, the butler Alton,

1371
01:25:06,216 --> 01:25:08,005
leaving with the French francs, and...

1372
01:25:08,091 --> 01:25:11,671
oui, there is a resemblance.

1373
01:25:11,759 --> 01:25:14,758
- He was hooking it with the money?
- Exactement, Chief Inspector.

1374
01:25:14,843 --> 01:25:18,837
I also believe he discovered the body
the night before,

1375
01:25:18,927 --> 01:25:21,132
and not the following morning,
as he told to us.

1376
01:25:21,219 --> 01:25:23,589
He took the opportunlty to steal the money

1377
01:25:23,678 --> 01:25:26,630
and was leaving the house
in orderto place it somewhere safe.

1378
01:25:26,721 --> 01:25:29,922
He thought Lady Edgware
would be arrested for the murder.

1379
01:25:30,013 --> 01:25:31,636
Précisément, Hastings.

1380
01:25:31,722 --> 01:25:36,677
It was only when it was discovered that
Lady Edgware, she had the alibi parfait,

1381
01:25:36,766 --> 01:25:38,258
that he panicked.

1382
01:25:38,349 --> 01:25:41,431
You mean he realised
we'd be looking for another motive?

1383
01:25:41,517 --> 01:25:42,547
Oui.

1384
01:25:42,641 --> 01:25:44,799
The theft of the money.

1385
01:25:44,893 --> 01:25:48,673
So you knew all along that it wasn't Brian, then?

1386
01:25:48,768 --> 01:25:50,226
Oui, mademoiselle.

1387
01:25:51,352 --> 01:25:56,853
But Monsieur Martin was not alone
in his dislike for Lady Edgware.

1388
01:25:58,188 --> 01:25:59,597
You, Miss Carroll.

1389
01:26:00,730 --> 01:26:04,890
When I asked you the identity of the woman
you saw entering the hall of Regent Gate...

1390
01:26:04,981 --> 01:26:08,229
It was her. I'd know her anywhere.

1391
01:26:08,315 --> 01:26:10,390
And I saw her quite clearly.

1392
01:26:10,482 --> 01:26:13,267
But you were standing
high up on the landing.

1393
01:26:13,358 --> 01:26:15,064
It's all right, Alton, I know the way.

1394
01:26:15,150 --> 01:26:18,647
The person who entered that night
wore a hat with a slanting brim.

1395
01:26:18,735 --> 01:26:21,021
From where you were standing,

1396
01:26:21,110 --> 01:26:23,267
it would have been impossible to see the face.

1397
01:26:24,194 --> 01:26:27,442
- I saw her.
- Non, mademoiselle.

1398
01:26:27,529 --> 01:26:29,769
You saw, I think, what you wished to see.

1399
01:26:29,863 --> 01:26:33,146
The woman who had wronged the man
you had well served.

1400
01:26:33,239 --> 01:26:35,028
It's true.

1401
01:26:35,114 --> 01:26:36,904
She never deserved him.

1402
01:26:36,989 --> 01:26:41,399
It would have been impossible for
Jane Wilkinson to have committed the murder.

1403
01:26:41,491 --> 01:26:43,398
Because as we now know,

1404
01:26:43,491 --> 01:26:46,775
Jane Wilkinson changed her mind
and attended the dinner at Holborn.

1405
01:26:49,076 --> 01:26:50,984
But from the beginning,

1406
01:26:51,076 --> 01:26:53,281
I have been perplexed...

1407
01:26:54,578 --> 01:26:56,948
..by five questions.

1408
01:26:59,579 --> 01:27:00,822
One:

1409
01:27:00,912 --> 01:27:03,200
What happened to the letter

1410
01:27:03,288 --> 01:27:07,152
written by Lord Edgware informing his wife
that he had agreed to the divorce?

1411
01:27:08,123 --> 01:27:09,366
Two:

1412
01:27:10,540 --> 01:27:13,622
Who is this letter P
on the little gold medicine box?

1413
01:27:14,916 --> 01:27:16,244
Three:

1414
01:27:17,125 --> 01:27:20,538
Who made the telephone call
to Jane Wilkinson at the dinner at Holborn?

1415
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:23,157
Four:.

1416
01:27:23,251 --> 01:27:27,708
How did a pair of pince-nez come to be
discovered in the handbag of Carlotta Adams?

1417
01:27:29,170 --> 01:27:30,497
And five...

1418
01:27:31,504 --> 01:27:34,419
Why did the letter of Carlotta Adams
state quite clearly

1419
01:27:34,505 --> 01:27:38,499
that it was Ronald Marsh
who paid to her the sum of $2,000

1420
01:27:38,588 --> 01:27:41,955
when it was impossible
he could have afforded that sum?

1421
01:27:42,048 --> 01:27:44,003
Do you have the answers?

1422
01:27:44,090 --> 01:27:47,172
Of course Mr Poirot has the answers.
That's why you're here.

1423
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:50,540
Merci beaucoup, Miss Lemon.

1424
01:27:51,843 --> 01:27:54,757
So let us begin
with the little gold medicine box.

1425
01:27:55,843 --> 01:27:58,842
From the start, I felt
that there was something strange.

1426
01:28:00,011 --> 01:28:04,088
Because the inscription inside
referred to a date seven months before.

1427
01:28:04,179 --> 01:28:07,048
But the jeweller told me
the box was brand new.

1428
01:28:07,138 --> 01:28:08,845
Oui. C'est ça.

1429
01:28:08,930 --> 01:28:13,008
You see, I do not believe
that there existed this P,

1430
01:28:13,098 --> 01:28:15,338
that there was no meeting in November.

1431
01:28:16,182 --> 01:28:18,257
We are in the world of the theatre.

1432
01:28:18,350 --> 01:28:22,593
And this little gold box,
it was used merely as a prop.

1433
01:28:22,684 --> 01:28:25,173
To make us think
that Carlotta was taking Veronal?

1434
01:28:25,268 --> 01:28:26,263
Oui.

1435
01:28:26,352 --> 01:28:30,132
But now let us turn our attention
to the pince-nez.

1436
01:28:30,227 --> 01:28:33,012
They were also found
in the handbag of Carlotta Adams.

1437
01:28:34,270 --> 01:28:37,269
But they were left there, I believe, by accident.

1438
01:28:37,355 --> 01:28:39,227
But who by?

1439
01:28:40,605 --> 01:28:44,351
By the woman who collected
the gold box from the jeweliery shop.

1440
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:49,933
This was the same woman who took a room
for the night at the Piccadilly Palace Hotel.

1441
01:28:51,900 --> 01:28:56,061
It was an American woman
by the name of Mrs Van Dusen.

1442
01:28:56,151 --> 01:28:58,059
Certainly, Mrs Van Dusen.

1443
01:28:58,152 --> 01:29:02,228
I met her. She was a writer.
She wanted me to have a look at her play.

1444
01:29:02,319 --> 01:29:06,017
Non, non, madame, that was not
Mrs Van Dusen who you met,

1445
01:29:06,112 --> 01:29:09,194
because Mrs Van Dusen, she does not exist.

1446
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:11,317
What?

1447
01:29:11,405 --> 01:29:13,811
Then who was she?

1448
01:29:13,906 --> 01:29:15,980
Ah, well, that is indeed the question.

1449
01:29:17,907 --> 01:29:23,242
You know, with the thick lenses,
the pince-nez are a disguise. Very simple.

1450
01:29:25,325 --> 01:29:30,149
But with a wig that is grey
and the cape of fur wrapped high...

1451
01:29:30,243 --> 01:29:33,610
Well, she had me completely fooled.

1452
01:29:33,703 --> 01:29:35,777
Are you saying she was part of all this?

1453
01:29:35,870 --> 01:29:38,074
Oh, yes. Yes, madame.

1454
01:29:38,162 --> 01:29:40,733
Mrs Van Dusen, yes,
she was very much a part of this.

1455
01:29:40,829 --> 01:29:45,783
She was the creation of a killer
who was cunning and cold-blooded.

1456
01:29:45,872 --> 01:29:47,911
Also, the creation...

1457
01:29:49,373 --> 01:29:51,779
..of an actress formidable.

1458
01:29:54,374 --> 01:29:55,785
Yes, madame.

1459
01:29:55,875 --> 01:29:58,543
All is known to Hercule Poirot.

1460
01:30:00,043 --> 01:30:03,908
The entire plan by which
you did indeed murder your husband.

1461
01:30:04,003 --> 01:30:06,788
Wait a minute, what are you saying?

1462
01:30:06,877 --> 01:30:08,750
So I was right?
It was her, after all.

1463
01:30:08,837 --> 01:30:11,705
But, Poirot, that's impossible.
You said as much yourself.

1464
01:30:16,922 --> 01:30:18,913
Not impossible, mon ami.

1465
01:30:21,006 --> 01:30:23,044
Let me explain to you...

1466
01:30:24,591 --> 01:30:26,748
..how it occurred.

1467
01:30:35,594 --> 01:30:36,672
Thank you, Alice.

1468
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:41,301
At seven o'clock in the evehing, Jane
Wilkinson leaves for the Piccadilly Palace Hotel.

1469
01:30:43,554 --> 01:30:45,213
On the way there, she makes a stop.

1470
01:30:47,055 --> 01:30:49,924
For, when she arrives,
her appearance, it has changed.

1471
01:30:50,015 --> 01:30:53,546
Now, there is the grey wig, the pince-nez.

1472
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:55,050
Room 174.

1473
01:30:56,099 --> 01:31:00,266
She takes her room using
the identity of an elderly American woman.

1474
01:31:01,525 --> 01:31:05,858
But the moment she is inside this room,
she removes her disguise...

1475
01:31:07,202 --> 01:31:11,867
..and awaits the arrival of a person she has
arranged to meet there that very same hight.

1476
01:31:19,599 --> 01:31:20,928
Carlotta, darling.

1477
01:31:21,017 --> 01:31:22,976
It's wonderful to see you.

1478
01:31:25,525 --> 01:31:28,694
So, are you sure about all this?

1479
01:31:28,781 --> 01:31:30,241
Are you really game?

1480
01:31:30,325 --> 01:31:31,606
You bet I am!

1481
01:31:34,875 --> 01:31:37,284
Tonight, I'm going to prove to you

1482
01:31:37,379 --> 01:31:41,214
just how good I really am.

1483
01:31:41,302 --> 01:31:43,926
And now the moment
for the second disguise,

1484
01:31:44,015 --> 01:31:46,057
it has arrived.

1485
01:31:46,144 --> 01:31:49,847
As arranged previously,
the two women exchange their clothes.

1486
01:31:49,942 --> 01:31:51,984
There, what do you think?

1487
01:31:53,156 --> 01:31:55,530
It's amazing. You're me.

1488
01:31:55,619 --> 01:32:00,083
For tohight, Carlotta Adams is
about to play the great practical joke.

1489
01:32:01,838 --> 01:32:06,254
This evehing, she will become Lady Edgware.

1490
01:32:06,345 --> 01:32:09,099
- Could I have a taxi, please?
- Certainly, Lady Edgware.

1491
01:32:10,061 --> 01:32:12,434
You know, all the time it had been so simple.

1492
01:32:14,109 --> 01:32:16,317
And yet still, I did not see.

1493
01:32:18,367 --> 01:32:22,699
Until a chance remark was made by my good
friend and colleague, Captain Hastings.

1494
01:32:22,791 --> 01:32:26,162
"It was actually the other way round."

1495
01:32:26,255 --> 01:32:29,128
Those were your very words,
n'est-ce pas, mon ami?

1496
01:32:29,219 --> 01:32:33,219
- Yes, but...
- And suddenly, all became clear.

1497
01:32:34,144 --> 01:32:36,601
Always, I had assumed

1498
01:32:36,690 --> 01:32:40,108
that Carlotta Adams had been paid
to act the role of Jane Wilkinson

1499
01:32:40,196 --> 01:32:43,781
while the real Jane Wilkinson
attended the dinner at Holborn.

1500
01:32:43,868 --> 01:32:45,744
But actually...

1501
01:32:46,957 --> 01:32:49,450
..it was the other way round.

1502
01:32:49,545 --> 01:32:52,751
It was Carlotta
who went to the dinner in Holborn.

1503
01:32:52,843 --> 01:32:55,762
That's impossible.
Someone would have recognised her.

1504
01:32:55,848 --> 01:32:57,889
No, I do not think so, mademoiselle.

1505
01:32:57,976 --> 01:33:00,386
There was the wig, the clothes,

1506
01:33:00,481 --> 01:33:03,567
and Carlotta Adams was
a performer most accomplished.

1507
01:33:05,656 --> 01:33:08,231
The dining-room was lit only by candlelight

1508
01:33:08,327 --> 01:33:13,325
and you must also remember that no-one
at the table had met the real Lady Edgware

1509
01:33:13,419 --> 01:33:15,747
on more than one or two occasions.

1510
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:18,677
But it was still a risk most grave.

1511
01:33:19,806 --> 01:33:21,681
It was essential

1512
01:33:21,767 --> 01:33:26,896
that Lady Edgware should ascertain
whether this deception had been a success.

1513
01:33:27,945 --> 01:33:29,820
And it was for this reason

1514
01:33:29,906 --> 01:33:33,076
that she made the telephone call
to the dinnerat Holborn.

1515
01:33:34,248 --> 01:33:36,289
It's gone like a dream.

1516
01:33:36,376 --> 01:33:38,454
Nobody suspects a thing.

1517
01:33:38,546 --> 01:33:42,382
That's wonderful, darling.
I knew you could do it.

1518
01:33:42,470 --> 01:33:44,215
Bye.

1519
01:34:00,752 --> 01:34:02,960
You're Alton, aren't you? Is my husband in?

1520
01:34:03,047 --> 01:34:04,044
Yes, ma'am.

1521
01:34:04,133 --> 01:34:08,215
The butler had only been employed
there for one month, so he hardly knew her.

1522
01:34:08,306 --> 01:34:12,520
And if he did express his doubts,
it would only be his word against hers.

1523
01:34:23,875 --> 01:34:24,990
And so,

1524
01:34:26,295 --> 01:34:28,171
having prepared her way,

1525
01:34:29,802 --> 01:34:30,918
she strikes.

1526
01:34:51,172 --> 01:34:54,674
But Carlotta Adams must not be allowed
to relate her tale.

1527
01:34:54,762 --> 01:34:59,343
So Lady Edgware arranged
to meet her again in the room at the hotel.

1528
01:34:59,436 --> 01:35:01,679
Perhaps they will have some wine

1529
01:35:01,773 --> 01:35:04,943
to celebrate the success.
of this great practical joke.

1530
01:35:07,032 --> 01:35:12,197
And the little gold medicine box which was
placed into her handbag and later found by us,

1531
01:35:12,291 --> 01:35:18,465
will make us believe Carlotta Adams was
a woman always in the habit of using this drug.

1532
01:35:22,184 --> 01:35:25,602
Lady Edgware learns
all the details she must know

1533
01:35:25,690 --> 01:35:29,192
if she is to pretend that
she did indeed attend the dinner at Holborn.

1534
01:35:30,490 --> 01:35:33,030
I was sitting opposite this young playwright.

1535
01:35:34,037 --> 01:35:35,153
Scottish.

1536
01:35:35,248 --> 01:35:37,741
His name was Donald Ross.

1537
01:35:37,836 --> 01:35:40,126
Carlotta Adams sips her wine.

1538
01:35:40,215 --> 01:35:42,043
..on and on about this play of his.

1539
01:35:42,135 --> 01:35:44,710
One hour later,
when she has returned home,

1540
01:35:44,806 --> 01:35:47,477
the Veronal will have taken its effect.

1541
01:35:47,561 --> 01:35:50,350
It was all about the war at Troy.

1542
01:35:52,778 --> 01:35:54,820
You made two mistakes, madame.

1543
01:35:55,783 --> 01:35:59,321
The pince-nez that you used
for the disguise of Mrs Van Dusen,

1544
01:35:59,415 --> 01:36:01,456
you took from your maidservant, Alice.

1545
01:36:01,543 --> 01:36:04,036
In all of the exchanges of costume, madame,

1546
01:36:04,131 --> 01:36:07,253
you left the pince-nez
in the handbag of Carlotta Adams

1547
01:36:07,345 --> 01:36:09,006
instead of your own.

1548
01:36:09,098 --> 01:36:10,214
Did I?

1549
01:36:10,309 --> 01:36:11,685
Yes, you did.

1550
01:36:13,314 --> 01:36:18,276
But more serious was your encounter
with the young writer, Monsieur Donald Ross.

1551
01:36:18,364 --> 01:36:20,822
I am fascinated by the judgement of Paris.

1552
01:36:20,910 --> 01:36:24,697
But Paris doesn't have any judgement at all
when it comes to fashion.

1553
01:36:24,792 --> 01:36:29,624
It was indeed a social gaffe to show
such ignorance on the judgement of Paris.

1554
01:36:29,718 --> 01:36:33,504
But only a few days earlier, he had
explained to you his play, the war of Troy.

1555
01:36:34,684 --> 01:36:36,725
It was inconceivable

1556
01:36:36,813 --> 01:36:40,315
that a woman, who had known then
of which he spoke, could be so ignorant now.

1557
01:36:40,403 --> 01:36:41,399
Paris...

1558
01:36:41,487 --> 01:36:43,814
- So he saw through her?
- Oui.

1559
01:36:43,908 --> 01:36:48,123
Malheureusement, Monsieur Donald Ross
expressed his suspicions

1560
01:36:48,208 --> 01:36:49,786
in the presence of Lady Edgware.

1561
01:36:49,877 --> 01:36:54,009
And it was at once that she knew
that he also had to be silenced.

1562
01:37:02,316 --> 01:37:04,190
So...

1563
01:37:04,277 --> 01:37:06,520
It was her all along.

1564
01:37:06,614 --> 01:37:10,450
But wait a minute, Poirot.
In that letter that Carlotta Adams wrote,

1565
01:37:10,538 --> 01:37:13,374
she definltely said she'd been hired by a man.

1566
01:37:13,459 --> 01:37:14,919
Ah, yes.

1567
01:37:16,924 --> 01:37:19,547
Oh, yes. That was most cunning, that.

1568
01:37:19,637 --> 01:37:23,970
Carlotta Adams did indeed
leave the house with a letter,

1569
01:37:24,062 --> 01:37:25,936
but she had neglected to post it.

1570
01:37:26,023 --> 01:37:28,350
And in the exchange of handbags,

1571
01:37:28,444 --> 01:37:33,323
it was discovered by Lady Edgware,
who decided to use it for her own ends.

1572
01:37:35,873 --> 01:37:39,791
Carlotta Adams wrote first
of her meeting with Monsieur Ronald Marsh

1573
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:42,587
and then ofthe person
who gave to her the money.

1574
01:37:44,179 --> 01:37:47,847
But what if there was
between these two descriptions...

1575
01:37:49,021 --> 01:37:51,264
..an entire page that was missing?

1576
01:37:52,402 --> 01:37:54,895
A page removed by Lady Edgware.

1577
01:37:56,200 --> 01:37:58,408
A page missing? How do you know that?.

1578
01:37:58,496 --> 01:38:02,876
Because, as she was writing,
there was left an indentation on the third page.

1579
01:38:02,962 --> 01:38:05,881
Here are some words you can see
from the page before.

1580
01:38:05,967 --> 01:38:08,341
But these very same words,

1581
01:38:08,429 --> 01:38:11,884
they do not appear on these pages that remain.

1582
01:38:11,977 --> 01:38:14,897
But the third page begins with "He asked".

1583
01:38:14,983 --> 01:38:16,977
She was writing about a man.

1584
01:38:17,069 --> 01:38:18,980
Oui, but you will notice, Hastings,

1585
01:38:19,073 --> 01:38:22,159
that on the top of this third page,
there is a little tear.

1586
01:38:22,245 --> 01:38:25,332
Now, always I had assumed
that this was made by accident,

1587
01:38:25,417 --> 01:38:27,376
but in fact, it was done on purpose.

1588
01:38:27,462 --> 01:38:29,503
To change "she" into "he".

1589
01:38:29,591 --> 01:38:31,632
Oui.

1590
01:38:31,719 --> 01:38:34,639
It was of Lady Edgware
that Carlotta Adams was writing.

1591
01:38:35,518 --> 01:38:38,391
And from Lady Edgware
did she receive the money.

1592
01:38:40,944 --> 01:38:42,819
Ah, madame.

1593
01:38:44,242 --> 01:38:46,651
You are a woman most remarkable.

1594
01:38:47,830 --> 01:38:48,994
Eh, parbleu,

1595
01:38:49,083 --> 01:38:51,041
to pull over my eyes the cotton wool.

1596
01:38:51,128 --> 01:38:53,502
The letter, the disguise.

1597
01:38:53,590 --> 01:38:56,214
Et surtout, to send me to your husband,

1598
01:38:56,303 --> 01:38:59,390
to turn me into a witness
that you had no motive for murder.

1599
01:38:59,476 --> 01:39:01,055
Ma foi!

1600
01:39:01,146 --> 01:39:04,599
You made of me,
Hercule Poirot, your cat's-paw.

1601
01:39:04,693 --> 01:39:09,074
But it's true, Mr Poirot, there was no motive,
if she was going to get a divorce.

1602
01:39:09,160 --> 01:39:11,783
A divorce would have been
of no use to her.

1603
01:39:11,873 --> 01:39:15,326
Which is why she pretended never to have got
the letter from her husband.

1604
01:39:15,420 --> 01:39:19,801
Monsieur le Duc,
you are of the religion catholique, n'est-ce pas?

1605
01:39:19,887 --> 01:39:22,759
Yes, I am. How did you know?

1606
01:39:22,849 --> 01:39:26,018
Jane Wilkinson told me you intended
to get married at Westminster.

1607
01:39:26,105 --> 01:39:29,061
Et naturellement,
I assumed that she meant the Abbey.

1608
01:39:29,152 --> 01:39:31,906
But later, you invited me to the Cathedral.

1609
01:39:32,909 --> 01:39:35,199
Westminster Cathedral.

1610
01:39:35,288 --> 01:39:38,494
Et voila. It was then that I knew
that you must be catholique.

1611
01:39:38,586 --> 01:39:40,496
And he couldn't marry a divorced woman.

1612
01:39:40,589 --> 01:39:44,257
- Oui.
- So that's why Lord Edgware had to die.

1613
01:39:44,346 --> 01:39:46,803
My God, Jane. Tell me it isn't true.

1614
01:39:48,686 --> 01:39:50,478
I'm sorry, Percy.

1615
01:39:57,201 --> 01:39:59,361
I really thought I'd get away with it, you know.

1616
01:40:01,541 --> 01:40:03,416
I thought I had you,

1617
01:40:03,503 --> 01:40:05,414
ze great detective,

1618
01:40:06,341 --> 01:40:08,336
round my little finger.

1619
01:40:10,348 --> 01:40:12,057
I've always had that, you know.

1620
01:40:12,894 --> 01:40:15,518
A power over men.

1621
01:40:17,861 --> 01:40:19,902
I wished only to protect you, madame.

1622
01:40:22,203 --> 01:40:24,410
But I could not protect you from yourself.

1623
01:40:25,750 --> 01:40:27,376
Jane!

1624
01:40:27,462 --> 01:40:30,251
Oh, I'm not going to deny it, Percy.

1625
01:40:30,341 --> 01:40:32,051
Why should I?

1626
01:40:34,306 --> 01:40:35,766
After all...

1627
01:40:36,852 --> 01:40:38,977
..I've actually enjoyed it.

1628
01:40:41,569 --> 01:40:43,610
All of it.

1629
01:40:44,657 --> 01:40:46,698
Even being caught.

1630
01:40:48,707 --> 01:40:49,952
I mean...

1631
01:40:51,002 --> 01:40:54,041
..it does put me centre stage.

1632
01:40:55,885 --> 01:40:57,844
And who knows?

1633
01:40:58,974 --> 01:41:02,476
Maybe they'll put me in Madame Tussaud's.

1634
01:41:09,868 --> 01:41:13,820
Poirot, I came as soon as I got your message.
What is it?

1635
01:41:13,916 --> 01:41:16,753
It is this, mon ami. It arrived for you today.

1636
01:41:16,838 --> 01:41:17,835
Oh.

1637
01:41:21,888 --> 01:41:24,560
Oh, it's a cheque made out to me for...

1638
01:41:24,643 --> 01:41:26,103
Good Lord!

1639
01:41:26,188 --> 01:41:29,227
- From the Duke of Merton, I understand?
- Well, yes, but...

1640
01:41:29,319 --> 01:41:31,562
After the arrest of Lady Edgware, Hastings,

1641
01:41:31,656 --> 01:41:33,614
the Duke, he made contact with me.

1642
01:41:33,701 --> 01:41:35,860
For him, it was a lucky escape.

1643
01:41:35,954 --> 01:41:40,122
He felt it deserved, as he said,
a reward most substantial.

1644
01:41:40,212 --> 01:41:42,253
But shouldn't this be made out to you?

1645
01:41:42,341 --> 01:41:46,423
Non, non, pas de tout, mon ami.
It was you who provided the clue that was vital.

1646
01:41:46,514 --> 01:41:47,796
"The other way round."

1647
01:41:47,892 --> 01:41:50,016
Précisément, Chief Inspector.

1648
01:41:50,104 --> 01:41:52,098
And therefore it is to you, Hastings,

1649
01:41:52,191 --> 01:41:54,101
that the reward rightfully belongs.

1650
01:41:54,194 --> 01:41:57,281
I thought we ought to celebrate.

1651
01:41:57,366 --> 01:42:00,988
It should be sufficient, mon ami,
for you to purchase an apartment in London.

1652
01:42:01,081 --> 01:42:02,742
Oh, I don't know, Mr Poirot.

1653
01:42:02,834 --> 01:42:06,882
I saw an interesting investment opportunity
in the financial pages this morning.

1654
01:42:06,967 --> 01:42:09,970
- Oh, yes?
- The Northern England Railway Corporation.

1655
01:42:10,056 --> 01:42:12,513
They're building a line from Liverpool to Carlisle.

1656
01:42:12,602 --> 01:42:16,649
Oh, yes, I read about that. They say you could
double that cheque in a couple of weeks.

1657
01:42:16,733 --> 01:42:19,523
- Do you really think so?
- Absolument, mon ami.

1658
01:42:19,613 --> 01:42:23,365
Of course, they will have to construct a bridge
over six miles of water.

1659
01:42:23,454 --> 01:42:25,911
They've got to get across
the Cumbrian mountains.

1660
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:29,204
The Scaffel Pike's only 3,000 feet high.

1661
01:42:33,596 --> 01:42:35,720
You know, I think I'll put this in the bank.

1662
01:42:35,808 --> 01:42:38,182
- Santé.
- Santé.
