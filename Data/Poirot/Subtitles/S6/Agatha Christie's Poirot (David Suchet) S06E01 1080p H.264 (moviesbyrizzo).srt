1
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,541
- We need the river
for access.

2
00:01:56,834 --> 00:01:58,749
- What about the other area
downstream?

3
00:01:59,042 --> 00:02:00,333
- We can't afford them both,
Simeon.

4
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:02,333
- Well, we've got to.

5
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:03,791
If anyone else
starts prospecting,

6
00:02:04,084 --> 00:02:05,249
we'll have lost
all that we've done

7
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:08,333
over the last six months.

8
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:09,958
- There.

9
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,416
That's my share for the claim.

10
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:28,916
- I'm off at first light.

11
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:31,208
I should make Pretoria
in four days.

12
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,791
- And be back in ten, eh?

13
00:02:33,084 --> 00:02:36,124
- And in six months...

14
00:02:36,417 --> 00:02:38,499
we'll be rich.

15
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:41,874
Good night, Gerrit.

16
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:44,291
- Good night.

17
00:04:12,542 --> 00:04:13,791
- Who the hell are you?

18
00:04:14,084 --> 00:04:15,624
- Stella de Zuigder.

19
00:04:15,917 --> 00:04:17,124
And you?

20
00:04:17,417 --> 00:04:20,458
- Lee.

21
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,291
Simeon Lee.

22
00:04:22,584 --> 00:04:24,124
How long have I been here?

23
00:04:24,417 --> 00:04:26,624
- This is your third day.

24
00:04:34,917 --> 00:04:38,083
You'd have died in half a day
if we hadn't have found you.

25
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:48,791
- Thanks.

26
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,583
I was, uh, mauled by a lion.

27
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,624
- Yeah, I know.

28
00:04:57,917 --> 00:04:59,916
I took the bullet out.

29
00:05:02,334 --> 00:05:05,416
- All right.

30
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:08,458
My partner attacked me.

31
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,958
- That's what diamonds do
to people, eh?

32
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,624
Don't worry.

33
00:05:12,917 --> 00:05:14,791
They're safe.

34
00:05:21,292 --> 00:05:22,208
And your map.

35
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,791
It's a bit bloodstained,
though.

36
00:05:24,084 --> 00:05:27,666
- Do you, uh...

37
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:29,624
live out here
all by yourself?

38
00:05:29,917 --> 00:05:34,666
- My father got tired
of trying to marry me off.

39
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,499
- Simeon?

40
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,541
Simeon?

41
00:07:03,334 --> 00:07:06,541
Simeon!

42
00:07:40,542 --> 00:07:41,499
- Happy Christmas.

43
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:43,041
- And to you, sir.

44
00:07:43,334 --> 00:07:45,124
Thank you very much.

45
00:07:45,417 --> 00:07:46,916
- Well, that's
the last decent meal I'll get

46
00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:48,083
till the New Year I expect.

47
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:49,291
- You are not looking forward

48
00:07:49,584 --> 00:07:50,833
to your Christmas,
Chief Inspector?

49
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:53,249
- We're going to Mrs. Japp's
family in Wales.

50
00:07:53,542 --> 00:07:54,416
- Ah.

51
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:56,666
- If they start singing again...

52
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:58,291
- I shall think of you,
Chief Inspector,

53
00:07:58,584 --> 00:08:00,749
as I sit down
to my simple repast.

54
00:08:01,042 --> 00:08:03,458
For Poirot,
it will be a quiet Christmas,

55
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,208
with my radio perhaps,
a book,

56
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,583
and a box of exquisite
Belgian chocolates.

57
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,041
- Well, listen, Poirot.

58
00:08:10,334 --> 00:08:14,124
Think of me on Christmas morning
when you open this.

59
00:08:14,417 --> 00:08:15,958
- Oh, thank you very much,
Chief Inspector.

60
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,124
- Merry Christmas, Poirot.

61
00:08:17,417 --> 00:08:19,458
- Merry Christmas to you.

62
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:29,624
- Oh, yes, of course.

63
00:08:29,917 --> 00:08:31,208
There we are, my dear.
- Thank you, sir.

64
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,666
- And a very happy Christmas
to you.

65
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:35,291
- And to you.
- Thank you.

66
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,541
- All right, all right,
I'm not a child.

67
00:09:16,834 --> 00:09:18,583
Bring them in.

68
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,916
- Mr. Simeon Lee?

69
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:36,374
- Yes.

70
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:38,583
Have you got them?

71
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,291
Get out.

72
00:10:08,584 --> 00:10:10,999
Get out, all of you!

73
00:10:11,292 --> 00:10:12,708
- Beg pardon.

74
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,083
Voilà.

75
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:17,458
- Can I help you?

76
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,999
- Yes, Monsieur Dicker?
- Yes.

77
00:11:19,292 --> 00:11:21,499
- Monsieur Dicker,
my radiator, it has gone cold.

78
00:11:21,792 --> 00:11:23,749
And there is a--
- The boiler is broken, sir.

79
00:11:24,042 --> 00:11:25,624
- Well, then the boiler,
it must be repaired.

80
00:11:25,917 --> 00:11:27,041
- It will be
after Christmas, sir.

81
00:11:27,334 --> 00:11:30,124
- After Christmas?
That is most unsatisfactory.

82
00:11:30,417 --> 00:11:31,999
- Unfortunately,
I can't do anything about it.

83
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:33,208
- I don't--

84
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,791
- I cannot get ahold
of a plumber, sir,

85
00:11:35,084 --> 00:11:36,041
until after the holidays.

86
00:11:36,334 --> 00:11:37,499
- I see.
I see.

87
00:11:37,792 --> 00:11:39,583
- I'm sorry about it,
but there's nothing I can do.

88
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:42,083
- Au revoir, Monsieur Dicker.

89
00:11:46,292 --> 00:11:49,249
Oh, non.

90
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,916
Yes?

91
00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:53,249
- Hercule Poirot?

92
00:11:53,542 --> 00:11:55,624
- Yes, it is I,
Hercule Poirot, who speaks.

93
00:11:55,917 --> 00:11:57,874
- I need a detective

94
00:11:58,167 --> 00:12:01,208
to come and stay here
in my house for Christmas.

95
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,291
- Non, monsieur, I...

96
00:12:02,584 --> 00:12:03,624
- Don't say no just like that.

97
00:12:03,917 --> 00:12:05,041
Hear me out.

98
00:12:05,334 --> 00:12:07,958
Superintendent Sugden
of the Shropshire Police

99
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,124
recommended you.

100
00:12:09,417 --> 00:12:10,458
- I do not know him.

101
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,958
- I don't care
if you don't know him.

102
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,749
He knows you.

103
00:12:14,042 --> 00:12:16,458
My life is in danger.

104
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,624
- Have you received
any threats, Monsieur...

105
00:12:19,917 --> 00:12:21,541
- Lee.
Simeon Lee.

106
00:12:21,834 --> 00:12:24,874
Ah, well, you'd have to be here
to understand.

107
00:12:25,167 --> 00:12:27,041
- Tell to me if you please,
Monsieur Lee,

108
00:12:27,334 --> 00:12:28,999
does your house have
the central heating?

109
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:33,166
- What?
Yes, of course.

110
00:12:33,459 --> 00:12:34,791
- Very well.

111
00:12:35,084 --> 00:12:38,291
Poirot will be there tomorrow.

112
00:12:38,584 --> 00:12:40,333
Give to me, if you please,
your address.

113
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,916
- Help the needy at Christmas.

114
00:12:58,584 --> 00:12:59,999
- Thank you so much, sir.

115
00:13:00,292 --> 00:13:01,458
Thank you.

116
00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:05,624
- Madam?

117
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:07,874
Help the needy at Christmas?

118
00:13:08,167 --> 00:13:09,749
Oh.

119
00:13:21,417 --> 00:13:24,249
- Are you ready to order, sir?

120
00:13:24,542 --> 00:13:25,708
- Yes.
Thank you very much.

121
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,124
But please to tell me,

122
00:13:28,417 --> 00:13:31,624
what is this
brown Windsor soup?

123
00:13:31,917 --> 00:13:36,208
- Well, sir, it's soup...

124
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,791
from Windsor.

125
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:39,083
- I see.

126
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,999
Then I will have
this brown Windsor soup,

127
00:13:42,292 --> 00:13:45,541
followed by the...

128
00:13:45,834 --> 00:13:47,958
and a side order of lamb,
separate...

129
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,458
- Okay if I share your table?

130
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,916
- Of course.

131
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,208
Well, I'll be glad
to get out of London,

132
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,791
I don't mind telling you.

133
00:14:09,084 --> 00:14:10,499
Oh, it's a terrible place.

134
00:14:10,792 --> 00:14:13,124
- But you are English, no?

135
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:15,708
- Been abroad for years.

136
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,916
What about you?

137
00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:19,416
- I am Spanish.

138
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:21,374
- Did you see
any of this, uh,

139
00:14:21,667 --> 00:14:24,333
civil war business
over in Spain?

140
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,499
- I saw a bomb drop.

141
00:14:26,792 --> 00:14:28,958
And it blew up a car.

142
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,333
- That didn't upset you?

143
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,958
- One is alive for a time
in this world, yes,

144
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,416
and then one is dead.

145
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:39,791
And one's friends are sad,
and one's enemies rejoice.

146
00:14:40,084 --> 00:14:43,624
- Don't you believe
in forgiving your enemies,

147
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:45,458
señorita?

148
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:49,791
- No.
I do not.

149
00:14:50,084 --> 00:14:53,458
If I had an enemy,
I would cut his throat,

150
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,416
like this.

151
00:14:57,709 --> 00:15:02,208
I wouldn't like to be
your enemy, señorita.

152
00:15:05,292 --> 00:15:09,041
- But it does not look very...
délicieux.

153
00:15:09,334 --> 00:15:12,208
- Well, sir,
it is brown Windsor soup.

154
00:15:14,584 --> 00:15:18,541
- What, um,
brings you to England?

155
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:22,083
- I am going to stay
with my English relations.

156
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:23,624
They are very rich, I think.

157
00:15:23,917 --> 00:15:25,916
They live in a big house
called Gorston Hall.

158
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:29,958
- Good God.

159
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,666
- What is it?

160
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,416
- You must be Jennifer's girl.

161
00:15:35,709 --> 00:15:38,791
- My mother's name was Jennifer.

162
00:15:39,084 --> 00:15:41,666
- I'm Harry Lee.

163
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:47,374
Jennifer was my sister.

164
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:49,333
Do the family know
you're coming?

165
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:51,374
- Oh, yes.

166
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:53,999
- That's more than they do
with me.

167
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,874
- He's playing God
as he always does.

168
00:16:11,167 --> 00:16:13,124
It's the role he enjoys most.

169
00:16:13,417 --> 00:16:15,499
- Well, I think
it's extremely boring.

170
00:16:15,792 --> 00:16:16,791
- Well, boring or not,

171
00:16:17,084 --> 00:16:19,458
it's our duty to be here,
Magdalene.

172
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:23,166
Moreover, it enables us
to save considerably.

173
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:25,874
- But we shouldn't have to
scrimp and save like this.

174
00:16:26,167 --> 00:16:28,124
Well, can't you make your father
give you some more money?

175
00:16:28,417 --> 00:16:30,499
- He upped my allowance
last year.

176
00:16:30,792 --> 00:16:32,249
- And what happens when he dies?

177
00:16:32,542 --> 00:16:34,833
- The bulk of his money
comes to Alfred and myself.

178
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,374
- Isn't there another brother?

179
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:37,416
- No.
No, no.

180
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:38,541
Harry left years ago.

181
00:16:38,834 --> 00:16:40,291
We don't talk about him,
incidentally.

182
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:43,083
A very disreputable character.

183
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,916
- Well, your father's not
all that reputable, George.

184
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,291
- What on earth
do you mean by that?

185
00:16:50,584 --> 00:16:51,333
- When he gets me alone,

186
00:16:51,584 --> 00:16:53,541
he makes me feel
quite uncomfortable.

187
00:16:53,834 --> 00:16:54,666
The things he says.

188
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:55,833
- Yes, yes.

189
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,541
Well, one has to make
allowances.

190
00:16:58,834 --> 00:17:01,083
- It isn't only
the things he says.

191
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:06,458
- At Father's age,
with his health being so bad...

192
00:17:32,334 --> 00:17:34,291
- Must you always
give in to him, Alfred?

193
00:17:34,584 --> 00:17:36,624
- He's a very old man, Lydia.

194
00:17:36,917 --> 00:17:39,833
- Then he'll get older
and more tyrannical.

195
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,999
But why must we have George
and Magdalene for Christmas?

196
00:17:43,292 --> 00:17:47,624
- Father hasn't seen George
for a long time.

197
00:17:47,917 --> 00:17:49,291
He's very good to us,
you know, Lydia.

198
00:17:49,584 --> 00:17:51,874
- Oh, Alfred!

199
00:17:52,167 --> 00:17:54,958
Magdalene's going to be
frightfully bored, anyway.

200
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,124
- Well, why George has to go
and marry a girl

201
00:17:57,417 --> 00:18:00,083
20 years younger than himself,
I shall never know.

202
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:01,916
He always was a fool.

203
00:18:02,209 --> 00:18:03,624
- I suppose she's been
quite a help to him

204
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:06,833
in his constituency.

205
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,416
- What is it, Horbury?

206
00:18:08,709 --> 00:18:09,499
- Beg pardon, sir.

207
00:18:09,792 --> 00:18:11,458
Is it convenient
if I take the car?

208
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,416
Mr. Lee has asked me
to go to the station

209
00:18:13,709 --> 00:18:15,958
and meet some more guests.

210
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,458
- Some more guests?

211
00:18:26,667 --> 00:18:28,249
- Wait a minute!

212
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,583
Come in!

213
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,583
- We have just seen Horbury,
and he says that--

214
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:54,833
- Ah, Lydia, my dear.

215
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,874
What a nice color you've got.

216
00:18:57,167 --> 00:18:58,999
- He says there are to be
more guests for Christmas.

217
00:18:59,292 --> 00:19:02,208
- Just straighten
my legs for me,

218
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,916
would you, my dear?

219
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:16,916
It's a terrible thing
to get old, Lydia.

220
00:19:17,209 --> 00:19:18,958
- Who are these people
that are coming?

221
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,208
- Well, first of all,

222
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,374
there's my old friend
Hercule Poirot.

223
00:19:23,667 --> 00:19:24,624
- Who's he?

224
00:19:24,917 --> 00:19:26,958
- A friend.

225
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,458
And then there's Pilar.

226
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,541
- Pilar?

227
00:19:30,834 --> 00:19:32,666
- Pilar Estravados,

228
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:36,999
Jennifer's girl,
my granddaughter.

229
00:19:37,292 --> 00:19:39,208
- But you didn't tell me.

230
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,124
- It's going to be
a grand Christmas!

231
00:19:42,417 --> 00:19:46,833
All my children round me.

232
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,416
There, now, Alfred.

233
00:19:48,709 --> 00:19:50,249
There's your clue.

234
00:19:50,542 --> 00:19:52,458
Guess who the other visitor is.

235
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,333
- But you haven't got
any more...

236
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:59,958
- Your brother, Harry,
of course.

237
00:20:12,417 --> 00:20:15,166
- What do you think
of the spats?

238
00:20:15,459 --> 00:20:17,333
And the patent leather shoes?

239
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:21,124
- Just the thing
for a weekend in the country.

240
00:20:23,792 --> 00:20:26,583
And those mustachios
must have enough wax in them

241
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:29,249
to keep Madame Tussauds
going for a fortnight.

242
00:20:42,167 --> 00:20:43,458
- Miss Estravados?
- Yes.

243
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,208
- Mr. Simeon Lee sent me
to meet you.

244
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,124
Mr. Harry Lee?
- Sure.

245
00:20:47,417 --> 00:20:48,958
- I'll put your bags
in the boot.

246
00:20:54,917 --> 00:20:56,208
Mr. Poirot?

247
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:05,416
- Are you a friend
of the old bastard Simeon?

248
00:21:05,709 --> 00:21:08,874
- I am a friend of Mr. Lee, yes.

249
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:11,291
- There's no good
you calling him Mr. Lee, chum.

250
00:21:11,584 --> 00:21:14,166
There'll be more Mr. Lees
than you can shake a stick at

251
00:21:14,459 --> 00:21:15,749
at Gorston this X-mas.

252
00:21:16,042 --> 00:21:17,499
And I'm one of 'em.

253
00:21:17,792 --> 00:21:20,249
Harry Lee's the name.

254
00:21:20,542 --> 00:21:21,791
- Hercule Poirot.

255
00:21:22,084 --> 00:21:23,124
- Pardon?

256
00:21:23,417 --> 00:21:24,999
- Poirot.
Hercule Poirot.

257
00:21:25,292 --> 00:21:27,041
- French, eh?
- Non.

258
00:21:27,334 --> 00:21:29,916
- I'm her long lost uncle.

259
00:21:30,209 --> 00:21:32,291
Tell him your name, Pilar.

260
00:21:32,584 --> 00:21:35,124
- Pilar Estravados.

261
00:21:35,417 --> 00:21:39,124
- You two should get on,
being foreign.

262
00:22:05,292 --> 00:22:07,041
- Alfred, the car's arrived.

263
00:22:07,334 --> 00:22:08,374
What are you doing?

264
00:22:08,667 --> 00:22:10,249
- I'm writing a note to Father,

265
00:22:10,542 --> 00:22:12,208
protesting in the strongest
possible terms--

266
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,458
- A note!

267
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,958
Whatever good do you think
notes are going to do?

268
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:26,541
Bless my soul.

269
00:22:26,834 --> 00:22:30,374
If it ain't Tressilian!

270
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:34,291
How are you, Tressilian?

271
00:22:34,584 --> 00:22:36,166
- Mr. Harry!

272
00:22:36,459 --> 00:22:39,083
- Still here, eh?

273
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:42,416
- Miss.

274
00:22:42,709 --> 00:22:46,624
- Still the same ugly old dump.

275
00:22:52,625 --> 00:22:56,124
- You don't look very tough.

276
00:22:56,417 --> 00:23:00,374
- Hercule Poirot is a detective,
not a bodyguard, monsieur.

277
00:23:00,667 --> 00:23:01,833
- Oh, is he?

278
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:05,333
Got a brain, has he?

279
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:07,583
Well, good thing somebody has.

280
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:10,208
All my sons are
complete nincompoops.

281
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,124
I've probably got better sons
scattered all over the world,

282
00:23:13,417 --> 00:23:17,458
born on the wrong side
of the blanket.

283
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:20,583
My family hate me, you know.

284
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:24,624
- It is not hard to see why,
Monsieur Lee.

285
00:23:24,917 --> 00:23:27,833
- They're frightened of me.

286
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:30,708
- It is often the way
with men who are old and rich.

287
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,124
- Well, anyway,
I'm going to make

288
00:23:32,417 --> 00:23:33,458
an announcement this evening,

289
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,499
and then they'll have
good cause to hate me.

290
00:23:36,792 --> 00:23:37,916
What do you want?

291
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:39,708
- You wanted to see
Miss Estravados, sir.

292
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,333
She's outside.

293
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:42,624
- All right.

294
00:23:42,917 --> 00:23:44,708
One more minute.

295
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:49,791
- What is it that you wish me
to do here, Monsieur Lee?

296
00:23:50,084 --> 00:23:52,249
- Keep your eyes open.
Keep your ears open.

297
00:23:52,542 --> 00:23:54,374
- Bien.
What am I looking for?

298
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:55,624
What am I listening for?

299
00:23:55,917 --> 00:23:57,874
- You'll know when it happens.

300
00:24:09,417 --> 00:24:13,624
- Tressilian is taking
your bags to your room, sir.

301
00:24:13,917 --> 00:24:16,541
- Thank you.

302
00:24:30,209 --> 00:24:33,583
- I've been
a very wicked man, Pilar.

303
00:24:33,875 --> 00:24:35,208
What do you think
of that?

304
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,124
- The nuns say
all men are wicked.

305
00:24:38,417 --> 00:24:40,874
- Nuns?

306
00:24:41,167 --> 00:24:42,458
But I don't regret it.

307
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,958
I've enjoyed
every moment of it.

308
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,999
I've cheated,
and I've stolen, and I've lied.

309
00:24:49,292 --> 00:24:51,291
And the women!

310
00:24:51,584 --> 00:24:53,291
Are you shocked, Pilar?

311
00:24:53,584 --> 00:24:55,916
- Why should I be shocked?

312
00:24:56,209 --> 00:24:57,541
Men always desire women.

313
00:24:57,834 --> 00:25:02,124
That is why wives are unhappy
and go to church and pray.

314
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:05,583
- You are the devil's brat.

315
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:08,166
- Oh, you like me to sit here
with you, Grandfather?

316
00:25:08,459 --> 00:25:09,541
- Yes, I do.

317
00:25:09,834 --> 00:25:11,791
It's a long time
since I was close

318
00:25:12,084 --> 00:25:14,166
to anything as young
and beautiful as you are.

319
00:25:14,459 --> 00:25:17,624
It warms my old bones.

320
00:25:21,084 --> 00:25:22,416
Ah, but you don't fool me.

321
00:25:22,709 --> 00:25:24,624
Don't think I don't know
why you sit here

322
00:25:24,917 --> 00:25:26,791
listening to me droning on.

323
00:25:27,084 --> 00:25:28,958
Money.

324
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,791
All right.

325
00:25:32,084 --> 00:25:34,416
I'll show you something.

326
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:55,666
I just got these yesterday

327
00:25:55,959 --> 00:26:00,249
from the company museum
in Pretoria.

328
00:26:02,292 --> 00:26:05,333
These are
the first diamonds

329
00:26:05,625 --> 00:26:09,666
I ever took
from my first mine.

330
00:26:09,959 --> 00:26:11,791
- But they are little pebbles;
that is all.

331
00:26:12,084 --> 00:26:13,083
- They are uncut.

332
00:26:13,375 --> 00:26:18,499
That's how diamonds are
when they're found.

333
00:26:18,792 --> 00:26:20,124
- Well, why do you
not have them cut?

334
00:26:20,417 --> 00:26:23,999
- Because I like them
like this.

335
00:26:24,292 --> 00:26:28,249
It all comes back to me.

336
00:26:28,542 --> 00:26:30,291
The sunshine,

337
00:26:30,584 --> 00:26:32,958
the oxen,

338
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:38,666
and the smell of the veldt

339
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:43,791
and the quiet
of the evenings.

340
00:26:48,917 --> 00:26:51,666
- It is unfortunate
that these so-called Republicans

341
00:26:51,959 --> 00:26:54,291
have forced him to take
the action he has taken.

342
00:26:54,584 --> 00:26:55,583
But take it from me,

343
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:58,958
Generalissimo Franco
has right on his side.

344
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,666
- Well, yes,
it is always reassuring

345
00:27:01,959 --> 00:27:04,958
to hear the opinion
of an expert on these matters.

346
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,791
- Can I top anybody's glass up?

347
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:08,333
- You're very tanned.

348
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:10,291
Have you spent time
in South Africa too,

349
00:27:10,584 --> 00:27:11,458
like your father?

350
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:12,624
- Only a year or two.

351
00:27:12,917 --> 00:27:14,416
I've been
in Argentina mostly.

352
00:27:14,709 --> 00:27:16,333
Well, apart from
my time in Macao.

353
00:27:16,625 --> 00:27:18,291
- I'm afraid I've been
absolutely nowhere.

354
00:27:18,584 --> 00:27:20,083
- Could I have a word, Lydia?

355
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:21,666
I'm sorry.

356
00:27:21,959 --> 00:27:23,416
- Excuse me.

357
00:27:26,584 --> 00:27:29,041
- I've remembered
who this Hercule Poirot is.

358
00:27:29,334 --> 00:27:30,624
He's a detective.

359
00:27:30,917 --> 00:27:31,874
- The police?

360
00:27:32,167 --> 00:27:33,208
Oh, surely not.

361
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,958
- He's one of those
private detectives.

362
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,124
- But why should your father
want to...

363
00:27:37,417 --> 00:27:39,958
- Excuse me, sir.

364
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,041
- What is it, Horbury?

365
00:27:41,334 --> 00:27:43,708
- Mr. Lee is ready
to see you all now.

366
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:49,499
- Come in!

367
00:27:49,792 --> 00:27:50,749
Hello.

368
00:27:51,042 --> 00:27:52,708
Is that you, Charlton?

369
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,874
Oh, yes.

370
00:27:54,167 --> 00:27:55,749
I'm sorry to trouble you
at home,

371
00:27:56,042 --> 00:27:57,749
but it is rather urgent.

372
00:27:58,042 --> 00:28:01,249
I want you to make
a new will for me.

373
00:28:01,542 --> 00:28:02,583
Yes.

374
00:28:02,875 --> 00:28:05,458
Sit down.
I won't be long.

375
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,458
Yes, well, you see,
it's some time

376
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:12,416
since the other will was made,
and things have changed.

377
00:28:12,709 --> 00:28:13,708
No, no, no.

378
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,291
I don't want
to spoil your Christmas.

379
00:28:15,584 --> 00:28:19,791
Come over on Boxing Day
or the next day, yes, yes.

380
00:28:20,084 --> 00:28:22,124
I shan't be dying just yet!

381
00:28:24,625 --> 00:28:26,416
Good-bye.

382
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:31,958
You're all looking
very glum.

383
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,624
What's the matter?

384
00:28:33,917 --> 00:28:35,083
Harry.

385
00:28:35,375 --> 00:28:40,249
I'd have known you anywhere,
even after all these years.

386
00:28:40,542 --> 00:28:43,874
Your taste in clothes
hasn't improved, I see.

387
00:28:44,167 --> 00:28:45,249
- Good to see you, Dad.

388
00:28:45,542 --> 00:28:46,999
You're looking well.

389
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,249
- Fortunately,
I did not ask you all up here

390
00:28:56,542 --> 00:29:00,083
for the pleasure of seeing
your smiling faces

391
00:29:00,375 --> 00:29:02,291
but because I want to say

392
00:29:02,584 --> 00:29:05,291
that we have to reorganize
things a bit

393
00:29:05,584 --> 00:29:09,374
now that we have two more people
living in the house.

394
00:29:09,667 --> 00:29:11,166
- What do you mean?

395
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:15,624
- Pilar will make her home
with us here, naturally.

396
00:29:15,917 --> 00:29:19,041
And Harry is home for good.

397
00:29:19,334 --> 00:29:21,291
- Harry's coming to live here?

398
00:29:21,584 --> 00:29:22,791
- What's wrong with that,
old boy?

399
00:29:23,084 --> 00:29:25,749
- Harry is my son too,
you know, George.

400
00:29:26,042 --> 00:29:27,958
Of course,
it is going to mean

401
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:30,916
cutting back a little
in other areas.

402
00:29:31,209 --> 00:29:33,833
Your allowance, for instance,
George, will have to go.

403
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:35,791
- You can't do that, Father.

404
00:29:36,084 --> 00:29:38,624
You don't understand how heavy
my expenses are already.

405
00:29:38,917 --> 00:29:39,833
- Oh?

406
00:29:40,125 --> 00:29:42,041
Well, let your wife
do her bit then.

407
00:29:42,334 --> 00:29:44,833
She could make
her own clothes.

408
00:29:45,125 --> 00:29:46,666
Even my wife could make
her own clothes,

409
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:48,666
and she was one
of the most stupid women

410
00:29:48,959 --> 00:29:50,249
it's been
my sorrow to meet.

411
00:29:50,542 --> 00:29:52,833
- You've no right to talk
about our mother like that.

412
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:54,791
- Right?

413
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:57,499
Right!

414
00:29:57,792 --> 00:29:59,833
You've no rights, any of you.

415
00:30:00,125 --> 00:30:02,999
You're just a set
of namby-pamby weaklings!

416
00:30:03,292 --> 00:30:06,124
Has any of you produced
one grandson for me?

417
00:30:06,417 --> 00:30:07,458
No!

418
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,041
- Hold hard, Dad.

419
00:30:09,334 --> 00:30:11,083
- I'm just sick to death
of the lot of you.

420
00:30:11,375 --> 00:30:12,791
Get out!
Get out, all of you!

421
00:30:13,084 --> 00:30:14,791
Get out!
Get out!

422
00:30:21,084 --> 00:30:22,333
- What's got into him?

423
00:30:22,625 --> 00:30:24,166
- Go to hell!

424
00:31:02,667 --> 00:31:03,499
- I blame you, Alfred.

425
00:31:03,792 --> 00:31:04,999
You've had
charge of him here.

426
00:31:05,292 --> 00:31:07,249
- What are you talking about?

427
00:31:07,542 --> 00:31:10,083
- I think there's a case for
getting a doctor in right away.

428
00:31:10,375 --> 00:31:11,416
- A doctor?

429
00:31:11,709 --> 00:31:13,458
There's nothing wrong
with him.

430
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:15,791
- He's clearly
not of sound mind.

431
00:31:16,084 --> 00:31:17,624
Two doctors, isn't it?

432
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:21,416
- Ladies, shall we?

433
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:28,624
- Shall I announce you,
superintendent?

434
00:31:28,917 --> 00:31:30,041
- That's all right, Tressilian.

435
00:31:30,334 --> 00:31:32,333
Mr. Lee's expecting me.

436
00:31:36,334 --> 00:31:37,624
- Come and have some coffee.

437
00:31:37,917 --> 00:31:39,416
The gentlemen will be
through in a minute.

438
00:31:39,709 --> 00:31:42,166
- Over here?

439
00:31:42,459 --> 00:31:44,124
- It's wonderful
that you could come, Pilar.

440
00:31:44,417 --> 00:31:46,583
- It's wonderful for me
to meet my uncles and aunts

441
00:31:46,875 --> 00:31:49,249
and this grand house.

442
00:31:51,459 --> 00:31:52,749
- After seven years?

443
00:31:53,042 --> 00:31:55,916
- But I've got these blokes
chasing me for cash!

444
00:31:58,334 --> 00:32:00,624
- I was having a word
at a cocktail party with Buffy,

445
00:32:00,917 --> 00:32:05,124
and you know he has
the ear of the PM.

446
00:32:07,375 --> 00:32:08,708
- Who was it?

447
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,916
- Mr. Sugden.

448
00:32:11,209 --> 00:32:12,749
Superintendent of police.

449
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:15,999
Watch what you're doing!

450
00:32:16,292 --> 00:32:17,333
- I'm sorry, Mr. Tressilian.

451
00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:20,583
- You've got no right
to go touching things.

452
00:32:20,875 --> 00:32:23,458
- What did he want,
this police superintendent?

453
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,874
- He's collecting
for the police orphanage.

454
00:32:26,167 --> 00:32:27,124
- Oh?

455
00:32:27,417 --> 00:32:28,499
And did he get anything?

456
00:32:28,792 --> 00:32:31,499
- I'm sure he did.

457
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,958
- We'll be having more snow
tonight, I shouldn't wonder.

458
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:45,583
- We'll be cut off again,
if we're not careful.

459
00:32:47,875 --> 00:32:48,791
- Good night, ladies.

460
00:32:49,084 --> 00:32:50,124
- Going to the pictures?

461
00:32:50,417 --> 00:32:52,083
- I expect so.

462
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,041
- It's coming from Dad's room!

463
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,291
- It's locked!
It's locked!

464
00:34:29,584 --> 00:34:33,083
Dad!
Dad!

465
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:34,791
- We're gonna have to break
the door down.

466
00:34:35,084 --> 00:34:36,624
- Don't be a fool.
It's made of solid oak.

467
00:34:36,917 --> 00:34:39,416
- Quick!
Battering ram!

468
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:44,708
- What's going on?
- One, two, three!

469
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,458
- Try again, harder.
- What does this mean?

470
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:47,999
- What was that terrible noise?

471
00:34:48,292 --> 00:34:49,916
- One, two, three!

472
00:34:51,417 --> 00:34:55,416
Again.
One, two, three!

473
00:34:55,709 --> 00:34:57,458
- You've got to put
some more effort into it.

474
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:00,999
- One, two, three!

475
00:35:01,292 --> 00:35:02,791
One more should do it.

476
00:35:03,084 --> 00:35:06,458
One, two, three!

477
00:35:08,292 --> 00:35:09,374
- Dad!

478
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:12,416
- Excuse-moi, monsieur.

479
00:35:25,334 --> 00:35:26,124
- I've forgotten my book.

480
00:35:26,417 --> 00:35:27,791
- I didn't know
whether to open it, sir.

481
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,291
- What's going on?

482
00:35:29,584 --> 00:35:31,833
- Something's happened
upstairs, sir.

483
00:35:32,125 --> 00:35:34,416
- Superintendent, I was just
going to telephone the police.

484
00:35:34,709 --> 00:35:35,958
I would've used
old Mr. Lee's phone,

485
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,583
but they told me
not to touch anything.

486
00:35:37,875 --> 00:35:38,791
Oh, dear.
- What?

487
00:35:39,084 --> 00:35:40,291
- It's old Mr. Lee, sir.
Mr. Simeon,

488
00:35:40,584 --> 00:35:41,958
he's been killed!

489
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,291
Murdered!

490
00:35:43,584 --> 00:35:45,624
- My God, what a shambles.

491
00:35:45,917 --> 00:35:47,541
Nothing must be touched.

492
00:35:47,834 --> 00:35:49,583
- All right.

493
00:35:52,625 --> 00:35:53,874
I want this room cleared.

494
00:35:54,167 --> 00:35:54,958
- Who are you?

495
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:56,999
- Police.
Superintendent Sugden.

496
00:35:57,292 --> 00:35:59,374
- You got here very quickly.

497
00:35:59,667 --> 00:36:04,874
- Would everybody
please wait downstairs?

498
00:36:05,167 --> 00:36:06,208
Excuse me, miss.

499
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,249
Nothing must be touched
or disturbed.

500
00:36:08,542 --> 00:36:10,083
- She knows that.

501
00:36:10,375 --> 00:36:12,333
- You picked up something
from the floor just now.

502
00:36:12,625 --> 00:36:14,041
- I did?

503
00:36:14,334 --> 00:36:16,374
- It's in your hand now.

504
00:36:16,667 --> 00:36:17,916
Please give it to me.

505
00:36:31,709 --> 00:36:34,666
Ah.
You must be Mr. Poirot.

506
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:36,791
- Superintendent.

507
00:36:37,084 --> 00:36:39,416
- Lucky we had a detective
here on the spot.

508
00:36:39,709 --> 00:36:40,833
- Perhaps.

509
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:42,124
- Stay in here, would you?

510
00:36:42,417 --> 00:36:45,833
- Look!

511
00:36:46,125 --> 00:36:47,749
- Don't touch it.

512
00:36:52,459 --> 00:36:55,458
- It is where he kept
his diamonds.

513
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:57,499
They have gone.

514
00:38:14,584 --> 00:38:16,791
- What are you doing here,
Poirot?

515
00:38:17,084 --> 00:38:19,499
- I've come to rescue you,
mon ami.

516
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:28,624
The Superintendent Sugden was
going to call in Scotland Yard

517
00:38:28,917 --> 00:38:30,083
in any case,
so I suggested that,

518
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:33,124
as you were just
across the border...

519
00:39:07,917 --> 00:39:11,083
- Well, it must have been
the work of a lunatic.

520
00:39:11,375 --> 00:39:12,458
- That's your theory, is it?

521
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,666
- Isn't there some mental home
in the vicinity?

522
00:39:14,959 --> 00:39:16,208
A homicidal maniac.

523
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,499
- How do you suppose
this homicidal maniac

524
00:39:18,792 --> 00:39:20,708
gained admittance
to the house, Mr. Lee?

525
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,124
The only door that wasn't locked
was the kitchen door,

526
00:39:23,417 --> 00:39:26,083
and the kitchen staff didn't see
any homicidal maniacs.

527
00:39:26,375 --> 00:39:27,291
- Well...

528
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:30,624
- Pardon.

529
00:39:30,917 --> 00:39:32,666
- No, come in, Mr. Poirot.

530
00:39:32,959 --> 00:39:35,916
- I have the Chief Inspector
Japp with me, superintendent.

531
00:39:36,209 --> 00:39:38,291
- Japp?

532
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:39,458
- Oui.

533
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:43,624
- From Scotland Yard?

534
00:39:43,917 --> 00:39:45,499
This is a pleasure indeed,
Chief Inspector.

535
00:39:45,792 --> 00:39:47,083
- Thank you, sir.

536
00:39:47,375 --> 00:39:49,541
- I expect you're used to this
kind of thing, Chief Inspector,

537
00:39:49,834 --> 00:39:50,958
but murders are few
and far between

538
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:52,124
in this part
of the country.

539
00:39:52,417 --> 00:39:53,791
- I imagine so, sir.

540
00:39:54,084 --> 00:39:55,291
- Well...

541
00:39:55,584 --> 00:39:57,291
I was just about to ask
Mr. George Lee

542
00:39:57,584 --> 00:39:58,749
the crucial question.

543
00:39:59,042 --> 00:40:00,791
- Oh, yes?

544
00:40:01,084 --> 00:40:02,624
- Which is, of course,
Mr. Lee,

545
00:40:02,917 --> 00:40:05,666
where were you
at the time of the murder?

546
00:40:05,959 --> 00:40:08,041
- I was in here...

547
00:40:08,334 --> 00:40:10,249
on the telephone...

548
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:11,791
calling my agent
in Westeringham,

549
00:40:12,084 --> 00:40:13,458
as a matter of fact.

550
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:16,291
- So you were actually
in this room

551
00:40:16,584 --> 00:40:19,041
when you heard
the noises from upstairs?

552
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:23,624
- The crashing about
and screaming.

553
00:40:23,917 --> 00:40:26,124
Yes.

554
00:40:26,417 --> 00:40:28,791
- Mr. Poirot tells me
these diamonds

555
00:40:29,084 --> 00:40:30,291
have gone from the safe, sir.

556
00:40:30,584 --> 00:40:32,749
- Yes, I'm getting a few more
men in from Shrewsbury

557
00:40:33,042 --> 00:40:34,916
to do a thorough search
of the house and grounds.

558
00:40:35,209 --> 00:40:36,666
But the theft of the diamonds

559
00:40:36,959 --> 00:40:39,624
may not be
as indicative as it seems.

560
00:40:39,917 --> 00:40:40,791
- Forgive me,

561
00:40:41,084 --> 00:40:42,958
but I don't understand,
superintendent.

562
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:45,333
- Mr. Lee telephoned me
yesterday afternoon.

563
00:40:45,625 --> 00:40:48,416
He wanted me to come over
and see him at 8:15.

564
00:40:48,709 --> 00:40:50,541
Made a special point
of the time.

565
00:40:50,834 --> 00:40:52,291
What's more, he told me
to tell the butler

566
00:40:52,584 --> 00:40:54,166
that I was collecting
for some police charity.

567
00:40:54,459 --> 00:40:55,541
- Ah.

568
00:40:55,834 --> 00:40:59,124
- Well, Mr. Lee is an important
person in these parts,

569
00:40:59,417 --> 00:41:00,958
so I did as he said.

570
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,916
He told me that
several thousand pounds' worth

571
00:41:03,209 --> 00:41:05,666
of uncut diamonds
had been stolen from his safe...

572
00:41:05,959 --> 00:41:06,999
he thought.

573
00:41:07,292 --> 00:41:08,249
- He thought?

574
00:41:08,542 --> 00:41:09,958
- He said they definitely
were missing

575
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:11,874
but that only two people
could have done it,

576
00:41:12,167 --> 00:41:15,208
and one of them
might have done it as a joke.

577
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,291
- I have yet to meet anybody

578
00:41:16,584 --> 00:41:17,874
in this household,
superintendent,

579
00:41:18,167 --> 00:41:19,958
that has even the most
rudimentary sense of humor.

580
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:22,124
- He didn't happen to name
these people, did he, sir?

581
00:41:22,417 --> 00:41:24,083
- No, he didn't,
Chief Inspector.

582
00:41:24,375 --> 00:41:25,499
But it's odd.

583
00:41:25,792 --> 00:41:26,666
He wanted me
to go away

584
00:41:26,959 --> 00:41:28,708
and come back again
in about an hour.

585
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,249
Said he'd have
a clearer idea then

586
00:41:30,542 --> 00:41:32,624
about if he'd been robbed
or if it was a joke.

587
00:41:32,917 --> 00:41:34,499
I can tell you,
by this time,

588
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:36,416
I was getting
pretty fed up with Mr. Lee.

589
00:41:36,709 --> 00:41:38,416
- But of the two people
that he suspected,

590
00:41:38,709 --> 00:41:40,291
is it possible that one
could be a servant

591
00:41:40,584 --> 00:41:41,916
and the other
a member of his family?

592
00:41:42,209 --> 00:41:43,083
- And if it was family,

593
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:44,458
he didn't want
to drop them in it?

594
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:45,624
- Well, yes.

595
00:41:45,917 --> 00:41:47,291
Perhaps my visit
was just meant to put

596
00:41:47,584 --> 00:41:48,791
the frighteners on them.

597
00:41:49,084 --> 00:41:50,374
- So you left?

598
00:41:50,667 --> 00:41:51,833
- Yes, I did.

599
00:41:52,125 --> 00:41:53,999
It wasn't worth my while
going all the way home,

600
00:41:54,292 --> 00:41:55,624
so I went
and sat in the car.

601
00:41:55,917 --> 00:41:57,708
I was just on my way back--

602
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,374
I was to use
leaving the orphanage

603
00:41:59,667 --> 00:42:01,666
subscription book behind
as an excuse--

604
00:42:01,959 --> 00:42:03,749
when all this hell
broke loose.

605
00:42:16,917 --> 00:42:18,333
- What's been going on in here?

606
00:42:18,625 --> 00:42:20,916
- Simeon Lee was a man who
was shrunken, old, and frail,

607
00:42:21,209 --> 00:42:22,208
n'est-ce pas?

608
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,083
And yet all this.

609
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,291
It signifies,

610
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:26,833
do you not think so,
Chief Inspector?

611
00:42:27,125 --> 00:42:28,499
- Looks more like
a five-star riot

612
00:42:28,792 --> 00:42:31,083
than a simple throat-cutting.

613
00:42:31,375 --> 00:42:32,791
This door was locked, you say?

614
00:42:33,084 --> 00:42:33,958
- Yes.

615
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:35,458
- May I?

616
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:38,416
- There are no prints on it,
apart from the old man's.

617
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,291
- Ah, you observe
the little scratches

618
00:42:47,584 --> 00:42:49,291
at the end of the barrel,
Chief Inspector?

619
00:42:49,584 --> 00:42:51,833
- It's been turned
from the outside,

620
00:42:52,125 --> 00:42:54,499
using long-nosed pliers.

621
00:42:54,792 --> 00:42:56,208
- But why, mon ami?

622
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,749
So that we would think
that Simeon Lee

623
00:42:58,042 --> 00:42:59,833
locked the door himself
and that it was suicide?

624
00:43:00,125 --> 00:43:01,666
That is a suicide most strange,
n'est-ce pas.

625
00:43:01,959 --> 00:43:03,499
Who hurls around the room
all the furniture

626
00:43:03,792 --> 00:43:06,124
and then screams
before he commits the act?

627
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,374
- Suppose Mr. Lee
put up more resistance

628
00:43:08,667 --> 00:43:09,958
than the murderer expected

629
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:12,124
and made such a racket
that he had to get out quick

630
00:43:12,417 --> 00:43:14,291
before he had time
to put the room to rights.

631
00:43:14,584 --> 00:43:16,416
- He couldn't have got out
through the window?

632
00:43:16,709 --> 00:43:20,458
- All bolted shut.

633
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:21,958
- This one isn't.

634
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:24,499
- But it's locked in
that position for ventilation.

635
00:43:24,792 --> 00:43:25,874
- But is it not a possibility

636
00:43:26,167 --> 00:43:29,291
that Simeon Lee
did, in fact, commit a suicide

637
00:43:29,584 --> 00:43:31,666
but wanted it
to look like murder?

638
00:43:31,959 --> 00:43:33,291
- Why would he do that?

639
00:43:33,584 --> 00:43:35,791
- Because Simeon Lee was a man
most vengeful, Chief Inspector,

640
00:43:36,084 --> 00:43:38,083
and had not a great love
for his family.

641
00:43:38,375 --> 00:43:40,916
- Blimey.

642
00:43:50,584 --> 00:43:51,541
- Superintendent,
what was it

643
00:43:51,834 --> 00:43:53,749
that Mademoiselle Estravados
picked up from the floor

644
00:43:54,042 --> 00:43:55,291
in the room
of Monsieur Simeon Lee?

645
00:43:55,584 --> 00:43:57,083
- Oh, last night?

646
00:43:57,375 --> 00:43:58,208
- Oui.

647
00:43:58,500 --> 00:43:59,958
- Here.

648
00:44:05,125 --> 00:44:06,708
In detective stories,
it's the sort of thing

649
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,624
that solves
the whole mystery.

650
00:44:09,917 --> 00:44:11,291
What do you think?

651
00:44:11,584 --> 00:44:15,416
- A little wooden peg.

652
00:44:15,709 --> 00:44:17,833
And a little rubber ring.

653
00:44:18,125 --> 00:44:19,083
- Keep them if you like.

654
00:44:19,375 --> 00:44:20,999
If they've got anything
to do with the murder,

655
00:44:21,292 --> 00:44:23,249
I'll retire
from the police force.

656
00:44:23,542 --> 00:44:24,583
- No, no, no, no.

657
00:44:24,875 --> 00:44:28,124
I would not deprive you
of them, mon ami.

658
00:44:28,417 --> 00:44:30,333
Tell me, what was it
that made you recommend me

659
00:44:30,625 --> 00:44:32,541
to Monsieur Simeon Lee?

660
00:44:32,834 --> 00:44:33,958
- I didn't.

661
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:35,999
- Ah.

662
00:44:37,792 --> 00:44:39,291
- What time was it
you went out last night?

663
00:44:39,584 --> 00:44:41,416
- Just after 8:00.

664
00:44:41,709 --> 00:44:44,416
I went to the cinema
in Oswestry.

665
00:44:44,709 --> 00:44:45,749
It's only ten minutes
on the bus.

666
00:44:46,042 --> 00:44:47,291
- Anybody see you there?

667
00:44:47,584 --> 00:44:49,958
- I was with a young lady.

668
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:51,541
- Oh, yes?

669
00:44:51,834 --> 00:44:52,916
What's her name?

670
00:44:53,209 --> 00:44:54,624
- Doris Buckle, sir.

671
00:44:54,917 --> 00:44:57,874
She works in the United Dairies
at Markham Road.

672
00:44:58,167 --> 00:45:00,124
I didn't have anything
to do with this, sir.

673
00:45:00,417 --> 00:45:01,749
- What can you tell us
about the diamonds

674
00:45:02,042 --> 00:45:02,833
Mr. Lee kept in his safe?

675
00:45:03,084 --> 00:45:05,166
- Nothing, sir.

676
00:45:05,459 --> 00:45:07,458
They arrived
the day before yesterday.

677
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:12,499
Mr. Lee said they came from his
old company museum in Africa.

678
00:45:12,792 --> 00:45:14,374
It's not very pleasant

679
00:45:14,667 --> 00:45:16,458
when the murder happens
in a house.

680
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:20,208
- Nobody said it was.

681
00:46:04,584 --> 00:46:06,208
- Morning.

682
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:07,624
- Good morning.

683
00:46:07,917 --> 00:46:08,791
- Can I help you?

684
00:46:09,084 --> 00:46:10,708
- No, no, thank you.

685
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,583
I'm just looking.

686
00:46:19,625 --> 00:46:21,708
- Christmas presents, is it?
- Oui.

687
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:22,874
- For the wife?

688
00:46:23,167 --> 00:46:26,499
- Uh, no, no, no.

689
00:46:26,792 --> 00:46:27,916
No,
if you please, monsieur,

690
00:46:28,209 --> 00:46:30,416
I should like to buy the present
for a good friend.

691
00:46:30,709 --> 00:46:33,124
- With a sense of humor,
I dare say.

692
00:46:33,417 --> 00:46:35,124
- Well...

693
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:38,749
- Bulb-operated hairy spider?

694
00:46:39,042 --> 00:46:40,374
- Oh!

695
00:46:40,667 --> 00:46:43,416
No.
Thank you.

696
00:46:43,709 --> 00:46:45,499
- My three-in-one packet
of itching powder,

697
00:46:45,792 --> 00:46:46,874
ink blot,
and stink bombs?

698
00:46:47,167 --> 00:46:47,958
- No, no, no.

699
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:50,624
No, you see, my friend,
he is a policeman.

700
00:46:50,917 --> 00:46:52,166
- Oh.

701
00:46:52,459 --> 00:46:54,083
He won't be wanting

702
00:46:54,375 --> 00:46:56,374
the Sherlock Holmes
detective set then?

703
00:46:56,667 --> 00:46:59,291
- I do not imagine so, non.

704
00:47:03,042 --> 00:47:04,333
- Cigars?

705
00:47:04,625 --> 00:47:06,124
- Exploding?

706
00:47:06,417 --> 00:47:07,999
- Jamaican.

707
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:10,458
- Ah!

708
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:13,291
Bon.

709
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:39,666
Bonjour, Madame Lee.

710
00:47:39,959 --> 00:47:41,124
Bonjour, monsieur.

711
00:47:41,417 --> 00:47:43,624
- Good morning, Mr. Poirot.

712
00:47:43,917 --> 00:47:47,583
- Pardon, madame, but I do not
understand that which you do.

713
00:47:47,875 --> 00:47:49,833
- Oh, it's just
a hobby of mine:

714
00:47:50,125 --> 00:47:51,458
miniature gardens.

715
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:53,624
Um, this one's a desert oasis.

716
00:47:53,917 --> 00:47:55,958
And this will be
an Italian vineyard

717
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:57,458
when it's finished.

718
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:59,791
And this is a Japanese garden.

719
00:48:00,084 --> 00:48:03,291
Do you see all the stones?

720
00:48:03,584 --> 00:48:05,374
- C'est charmant.

721
00:48:05,667 --> 00:48:07,374
- Mr. Poirot,
why did my father-in-law

722
00:48:07,667 --> 00:48:10,499
ask you to Gorston?

723
00:48:10,792 --> 00:48:14,624
- To tell you the truth,
madame, I am not sure.

724
00:48:14,917 --> 00:48:17,374
He told to me
that his life was in danger.

725
00:48:17,667 --> 00:48:19,583
- But from whom?

726
00:48:19,875 --> 00:48:22,833
- He did not specify.

727
00:48:27,167 --> 00:48:29,958
- There is somebody
I don't trust.

728
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:34,791
Horbury's only been
with us a year and...

729
00:48:35,084 --> 00:48:36,916
- Tell me, madame.

730
00:48:37,209 --> 00:48:39,083
At the time of the murder,
your husband,

731
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:43,249
he was in the dining room
with Monsieur Harry?

732
00:48:43,542 --> 00:48:44,833
Where were you?

733
00:48:45,125 --> 00:48:46,458
- I was in the drawing room
having coffee.

734
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:48,291
- So you were alone?

735
00:48:48,584 --> 00:48:50,791
- No, no,
the Spanish girl was there.

736
00:48:51,084 --> 00:48:52,749
No, no, she wasn't.

737
00:48:53,042 --> 00:48:55,124
She went out
a couple of minutes before.

738
00:48:55,417 --> 00:48:57,874
First, Magdalene went,

739
00:48:58,167 --> 00:49:02,249
and then Pilar went.

740
00:49:02,542 --> 00:49:04,874
- So you were quite alone?

741
00:49:05,167 --> 00:49:08,291
- Yes, I suppose I was.

742
00:49:08,584 --> 00:49:10,041
- And tell me,
who was the first to arrive

743
00:49:10,334 --> 00:49:11,958
at the door
of your father-in-law?

744
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:15,166
- I was.

745
00:49:15,459 --> 00:49:16,708
- It's locked!
It's locked!

746
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,124
- And you saw there
no other person,

747
00:49:18,417 --> 00:49:19,916
no other person
who came out of the room?

748
00:49:20,209 --> 00:49:21,874
- Of course not.

749
00:49:25,417 --> 00:49:27,874
- Tell me, Monsieur Lee.

750
00:49:28,167 --> 00:49:28,999
I have to, I'm afraid,

751
00:49:29,292 --> 00:49:30,583
ask the questions
most obvious

752
00:49:30,875 --> 00:49:33,041
as well as
the subtle ones.

753
00:49:33,334 --> 00:49:34,833
Did you know
the combination of the safe

754
00:49:35,125 --> 00:49:36,041
belonging to your father?

755
00:49:36,334 --> 00:49:37,374
- No.
Nobody did.

756
00:49:37,667 --> 00:49:40,291
But it would have been
easy enough to discover.

757
00:49:40,584 --> 00:49:43,666
You must find out who did
this awful thing, Mr. Poirot.

758
00:49:43,959 --> 00:49:46,583
You must find out!

759
00:50:02,584 --> 00:50:04,958
- Very violent sort of blokes,
these Africans.

760
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:07,083
- Europeans do not figure
too badly

761
00:50:07,375 --> 00:50:09,041
in the arts of violence,
Chief Inspector.

762
00:50:09,334 --> 00:50:11,166
- But it gives you the creeps,
this place, doesn't it?

763
00:50:11,459 --> 00:50:13,333
- You are too sensitive,
mon ami.

764
00:50:13,625 --> 00:50:16,041
- That's true.

765
00:50:16,334 --> 00:50:17,791
- Chief Inspector...

766
00:50:18,084 --> 00:50:19,124
- What is it, Poirot?

767
00:50:19,417 --> 00:50:21,374
- We know
of two possible motives

768
00:50:21,667 --> 00:50:23,124
for the murder
of Monsieur Simeon Lee.

769
00:50:23,417 --> 00:50:26,374
One is a simple case
of the theft of the diamonds.

770
00:50:26,667 --> 00:50:28,124
- And the other's
old Simeon's will.

771
00:50:28,417 --> 00:50:29,541
Did someone want him dead

772
00:50:29,834 --> 00:50:31,708
before he could make
the changes he was threatening?

773
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,249
- Précisément.

774
00:50:35,417 --> 00:50:37,083
- No, no, no, no.

775
00:50:37,375 --> 00:50:40,333
You'll go in-off
if you do that.

776
00:50:40,625 --> 00:50:45,999
Now, grip the butt
of the cue firmly...

777
00:50:46,292 --> 00:50:47,124
and...

778
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:49,624
- Ah, good morning.

779
00:50:49,917 --> 00:50:51,499
Mr. Harry Lee,
I presume?

780
00:50:51,792 --> 00:50:52,708
- And who are you?

781
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,833
- Chief Inspector Japp,
Scotland Yard.

782
00:50:55,125 --> 00:50:57,333
- Ah, brought in the big guns,
have they?

783
00:50:57,625 --> 00:51:00,791
- I'd like a word
with Miss Es-trah-vados.

784
00:51:01,084 --> 00:51:03,833
- Estra-vah-dos.

785
00:51:04,125 --> 00:51:05,749
- Yes.

786
00:51:06,042 --> 00:51:07,416
In private.

787
00:51:15,417 --> 00:51:17,874
- Don't let them bully you, kid.

788
00:51:20,834 --> 00:51:22,458
- Now, then, Miss Estra--
- Vados.

789
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:25,499
- Estravados.
Quite.

790
00:51:25,792 --> 00:51:28,291
You understand English
all right, do you?

791
00:51:28,584 --> 00:51:31,041
- My mother was English.

792
00:51:31,334 --> 00:51:33,666
I am really
a very English person.

793
00:51:33,959 --> 00:51:37,416
- Is your passport English?

794
00:51:37,709 --> 00:51:38,999
- It is Spanish.

795
00:51:39,292 --> 00:51:41,791
- We'd better have a look
at that, if you don't mind.

796
00:51:42,084 --> 00:51:43,958
- It's in my luggage I think.

797
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:47,208
- So your grandfather sent
for you to come from Spain,

798
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,499
and you arrived here yesterday;
is that right?

799
00:51:49,792 --> 00:51:50,624
- Yes.

800
00:51:50,917 --> 00:51:53,666
- Tell me, mademoiselle,
when you--

801
00:51:53,959 --> 00:51:57,249
- Sorry; I was looking
for Sergeant Coombes.

802
00:51:57,542 --> 00:51:59,583
Please, don't let me interrupt.

803
00:52:04,125 --> 00:52:06,041
- When you first met
your grandfather,

804
00:52:06,334 --> 00:52:07,916
what did you think of him?

805
00:52:08,209 --> 00:52:10,666
- He was very, very old.

806
00:52:10,959 --> 00:52:15,999
He had to sit in a chair,
and his face was all dried up.

807
00:52:16,292 --> 00:52:18,583
But I like him all the same.

808
00:52:18,875 --> 00:52:20,416
I think that
when he was a young man,

809
00:52:20,709 --> 00:52:24,958
he must have been
very handsome.

810
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:27,708
Like you.

811
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,291
- There you are, sir.

812
00:52:30,584 --> 00:52:33,791
- I think I'd better go
and find Sergeant Coombes.

813
00:52:34,084 --> 00:52:35,958
- Now, these diamonds
that have been stolen...

814
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:37,541
- They were not like diamonds,

815
00:52:37,834 --> 00:52:39,791
just very ugly little stones.

816
00:52:40,084 --> 00:52:41,624
- So he showed them to you,
did he?

817
00:52:41,917 --> 00:52:43,874
Didn't give you any of them,
I suppose?

818
00:52:44,167 --> 00:52:45,791
- No.

819
00:52:46,084 --> 00:52:47,374
But I thought
that one day he would,

820
00:52:47,667 --> 00:52:49,291
if I was very nice to him

821
00:52:49,584 --> 00:52:51,791
and came often
to sit with him,

822
00:52:52,084 --> 00:52:53,624
because old men--

823
00:52:53,917 --> 00:52:56,624
they like very much
young girls.

824
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:02,624
- Tell me, mademoiselle.

825
00:53:02,917 --> 00:53:04,333
Who do you think
stole them?

826
00:53:04,625 --> 00:53:05,791
- Horbury.

827
00:53:06,084 --> 00:53:06,958
- Why do you say that?

828
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:08,916
- He has the face
of a thief.

829
00:53:09,209 --> 00:53:11,624
His eyes go so...

830
00:53:11,917 --> 00:53:15,249
from side to side,
and he listens at doors.

831
00:53:17,417 --> 00:53:20,458
- Where were you when the crime
was committed, Miss Estravados?

832
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:22,666
- I went up to my room.

833
00:53:22,959 --> 00:53:26,208
I remember the butler
had just brought in the coffee.

834
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:27,958
But I wanted
a clean handkerchief,

835
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:31,791
so I went upstairs.

836
00:53:32,084 --> 00:53:34,416
I was sitting
at my dressing table,

837
00:53:34,709 --> 00:53:38,208
repairing my makeup.

838
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,124
And then far away,
I heard a scream

839
00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:42,958
and everybody running,

840
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:44,958
and so I went too.

841
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:46,624
- I see.

842
00:53:46,917 --> 00:53:48,749
So you were all by yourself,

843
00:53:49,042 --> 00:53:50,958
up in your bedroom,

844
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:53,291
when Simeon Lee died?

845
00:53:53,584 --> 00:53:55,958
- Yes.

846
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:59,208
Yes, I was.

847
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:16,291
- Here, Sergeant!

848
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:33,791
- Empty.

849
00:54:34,084 --> 00:54:35,458
- Whose room is this?

850
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:36,958
- It's that member
of Parliament's

851
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:39,499
and his wife's.

852
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:26,333
- You know what I think, Poirot?

853
00:55:26,625 --> 00:55:28,416
- Non, Chief Inspector.
What is it that you think?

854
00:55:28,709 --> 00:55:30,166
- I think this murder
was done by a woman.

855
00:55:30,459 --> 00:55:31,333
That's what I think.

856
00:55:31,625 --> 00:55:34,124
- And why is it
that you think that?

857
00:55:34,417 --> 00:55:35,208
- Right.
- Merci.

858
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:37,416
- Simeon Lee was
a frail, old man, yes?

859
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:40,124
- Monsieur Simeon Lee was a man
of the frailness extreme, oui.

860
00:55:40,417 --> 00:55:42,291
- Then how do you account
for the furniture in his room

861
00:55:42,584 --> 00:55:44,291
being knocked about
all over the shop like it was?

862
00:55:44,584 --> 00:55:46,208
I mean, he couldn't have put up
much of a struggle

863
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:47,291
against a man, could he?

864
00:55:47,584 --> 00:55:48,624
But against a woman...

865
00:55:48,917 --> 00:55:51,416
- Ah, Chief Inspector,
you have been thinking again.

866
00:55:51,709 --> 00:55:53,291
I have warned you
of this before.

867
00:55:53,584 --> 00:55:54,666
- Oh, well.

868
00:55:54,959 --> 00:55:56,499
- But you know, seriously,
Chief Inspector,

869
00:55:56,792 --> 00:55:58,499
all of the family,
the women included,

870
00:55:58,792 --> 00:56:00,624
they will have alibis
for the time of the murder.

871
00:56:00,917 --> 00:56:02,124
- Well, the lovely
Magdalene Lee's

872
00:56:02,417 --> 00:56:03,458
is pretty flimsy,

873
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:07,083
and it was her luggage
we found the diamond case in.

874
00:56:07,375 --> 00:56:08,791
- If I'd stolen the diamonds,

875
00:56:09,084 --> 00:56:10,458
do you really think
I'd be stupid enough

876
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:12,583
to leave the box
in my own luggage?

877
00:56:12,875 --> 00:56:14,624
- Would you tell us
where you were

878
00:56:14,917 --> 00:56:16,333
at the time of the murder,
Mrs. Lee?

879
00:56:16,625 --> 00:56:17,499
- In the drawing room.

880
00:56:17,792 --> 00:56:19,833
- In the drawing room
with Mrs. Lydia Lee?

881
00:56:20,125 --> 00:56:21,458
- Um...no.

882
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:23,124
I'd come in here
to telephone.

883
00:56:23,417 --> 00:56:24,999
- Was anybody
in the room with you?

884
00:56:25,292 --> 00:56:26,541
- No.

885
00:56:26,834 --> 00:56:28,249
It was a private call.

886
00:56:28,542 --> 00:56:29,541
I was alone.

887
00:56:29,834 --> 00:56:31,458
- How long were you in here,
Madame Lee?

888
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:34,124
- What's it got to do with you?

889
00:56:34,417 --> 00:56:35,916
- Just answer the question.

890
00:56:36,209 --> 00:56:37,833
- How should I know?

891
00:56:38,125 --> 00:56:40,624
15 minutes?
20?

892
00:56:40,917 --> 00:56:42,041
You know how long it takes

893
00:56:42,334 --> 00:56:43,583
to put a call through
in the evening.

894
00:56:43,875 --> 00:56:45,291
- It was a trunk call then?

895
00:56:45,584 --> 00:56:47,124
- Well, of course it was.

896
00:56:47,417 --> 00:56:48,916
You don't honestly think
I'd know anybody

897
00:56:49,209 --> 00:56:51,291
in this godforsaken dump,
do you?

898
00:56:51,584 --> 00:56:53,624
- Well, one of them's lying.

899
00:56:53,917 --> 00:56:55,208
The lovely Magdalene
can't have been

900
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:56,666
in there alone
making a phone call,

901
00:56:56,959 --> 00:56:57,999
the same time
as her husband was

902
00:56:58,292 --> 00:56:59,791
in there alone
making a phone call.

903
00:57:00,084 --> 00:57:01,124
- Exactement.

904
00:57:01,417 --> 00:57:03,124
Perhaps we should tax them
with this together,

905
00:57:03,417 --> 00:57:05,083
Chief Inspector.

906
00:57:08,209 --> 00:57:10,124
- Here's another thing
I've been thinking, Poirot...

907
00:57:10,417 --> 00:57:11,458
- Boy!

908
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:14,333
On the desk in my room,
you'll find my spectacles.

909
00:57:14,625 --> 00:57:15,874
- In your room, madam?

910
00:57:16,167 --> 00:57:18,291
- There's something not quite
English about this murder.

911
00:57:18,584 --> 00:57:19,416
- Comment?

912
00:57:19,709 --> 00:57:20,791
- This throat-slitting.

913
00:57:21,084 --> 00:57:23,083
Not quite our style.

914
00:57:29,959 --> 00:57:31,499
What'll you have then, Poirot?

915
00:57:31,792 --> 00:57:33,624
- Well, that's very kind of you,
Chief Inspector.

916
00:57:33,917 --> 00:57:36,624
A glass of dry white wine.

917
00:57:36,917 --> 00:57:37,916
- Wine?

918
00:57:38,209 --> 00:57:40,666
- A Muscadet, perhaps?

919
00:57:40,959 --> 00:57:43,416
- Well, they might have
some cider.

920
00:57:48,417 --> 00:57:49,916
- Hello, Hercule.

921
00:57:52,042 --> 00:57:55,208
How are you doing?

922
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:56,624
Let me buy you a drink.

923
00:57:56,917 --> 00:57:58,166
- Non, merci.

924
00:57:58,459 --> 00:58:00,541
The Chief Inspector Japp
is already buying me one.

925
00:58:00,834 --> 00:58:05,208
- So...it was
the glamorous Magdalene

926
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:09,208
had the diamonds all the time
I hear.

927
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:13,291
- Uh...the leather box
but not the diamonds.

928
00:58:13,584 --> 00:58:14,624
- Ah.

929
00:58:14,917 --> 00:58:16,666
- Ah, Mr. Lee,
I've been looking for you.

930
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:19,749
- Well, you only had to look
in the nearest pub.

931
00:58:20,042 --> 00:58:20,833
But tell me, though.

932
00:58:21,125 --> 00:58:22,458
What do you think
of the opening times

933
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:24,874
in this country?

934
00:58:25,167 --> 00:58:27,166
- Sit down for a minute.

935
00:58:30,292 --> 00:58:32,249
Good health.

936
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:37,583
What made you decide
to return to England

937
00:58:37,875 --> 00:58:39,083
after all these years?

938
00:58:39,375 --> 00:58:43,833
- I thought the fatted calf
would make a welcome change.

939
00:58:44,125 --> 00:58:47,541
No, my father wrote to me
a year or so ago,

940
00:58:47,834 --> 00:58:50,083
suggesting that I came home,
so I came.

941
00:58:50,375 --> 00:58:51,791
- And, Monsieur Alfred,

942
00:58:52,084 --> 00:58:54,083
how did he feel
about your return?

943
00:58:54,375 --> 00:58:56,874
- Alfred's always been
jealous of me.

944
00:58:57,167 --> 00:58:59,749
You see, he was the good,
stay-at-home,

945
00:59:00,042 --> 00:59:01,708
stick-in-the-mud son.

946
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,458
- Mm.

947
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:05,666
Tell me, Monsieur Lee.

948
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:07,958
What do you think was
the purpose of the confrontation

949
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:09,499
that your father had
with his family

950
00:59:09,792 --> 00:59:10,958
before dinner last evening?

951
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:14,874
He wanted to see the fur fly.

952
00:59:15,167 --> 00:59:17,874
He was watching us
like a cat

953
00:59:18,167 --> 00:59:19,499
to see how we reacted.

954
00:59:19,792 --> 00:59:22,291
- What changes in his will was
he thinking about; do you know?

955
00:59:22,584 --> 00:59:24,958
- I imagined...

956
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:27,583
shall I say, I hoped...

957
00:59:27,875 --> 00:59:29,166
the change would be
to the benefit

958
00:59:29,459 --> 00:59:31,166
of your humble servant.

959
00:59:31,459 --> 00:59:33,499
Pilar, too,
I wouldn't be surprised.

960
00:59:33,792 --> 00:59:36,208
- You got any theories
about this murder, Mr. Lee?

961
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,791
- I don't understand it at all.

962
00:59:39,084 --> 00:59:40,249
I mean, that door was locked.

963
00:59:40,542 --> 00:59:42,374
It took some doing
to break it open.

964
00:59:42,667 --> 00:59:44,791
And there was no one
in the room but Dad.

965
00:59:45,084 --> 00:59:47,208
Nobody could have got out
through the window.

966
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,791
- The door was locked
from the outside.

967
00:59:50,084 --> 00:59:53,291
- No, key was on the inside.

968
00:59:53,584 --> 00:59:55,499
- You noticed that,
Monsieur Lee?

969
00:59:55,792 --> 00:59:58,708
- Well...

970
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,958
I do notice things.

971
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:04,958
It's a habit of mine.

972
01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:08,333
I, um...

973
01:00:08,625 --> 01:00:11,708
I must get back
to my friends.

974
01:00:16,959 --> 01:00:19,499
- I've been feeling
very queer.

975
01:00:19,792 --> 01:00:21,291
Very queer indeed.

976
01:00:21,584 --> 01:00:23,124
- It is indeed
a business most odd.

977
01:00:23,417 --> 01:00:25,791
- Oh, dear, it gave me
quite a turn, it did,

978
01:00:26,084 --> 01:00:27,041
when I went into the hall,

979
01:00:27,334 --> 01:00:30,083
and there was this strange man
standing there.

980
01:00:30,375 --> 01:00:33,541
And Mr. Harry's voice said,

981
01:00:33,834 --> 01:00:35,624
"Still here, Tressilian?"

982
01:00:35,917 --> 01:00:39,333
Alive.
The same as ever.

983
01:00:39,625 --> 01:00:41,791
- It must have been
a feeling most strange.

984
01:00:42,084 --> 01:00:43,291
- It seems sometimes

985
01:00:43,584 --> 01:00:45,249
as if the past
isn't the past at all.

986
01:00:45,542 --> 01:00:48,458
It seems to be, the bell rings,
and I go to let someone in--

987
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:51,333
doesn't matter if it's
Mr. Harry or Mr. George

988
01:00:51,625 --> 01:00:53,791
or Superintendent Sugden even.

989
01:00:54,084 --> 01:00:57,708
But I'm saying to myself,

990
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,583
"But I've done all this before."

991
01:01:02,667 --> 01:01:05,249
- That is most interesting,
Tressilian.

992
01:01:05,542 --> 01:01:08,291
- Yes, well...

993
01:01:08,584 --> 01:01:09,749
I'd just like to check

994
01:01:10,042 --> 01:01:11,833
some times with you,
Mr. Tressilian.

995
01:01:12,125 --> 01:01:16,041
When the noise started upstairs,
Mr. George Lee was telephoning.

996
01:01:16,334 --> 01:01:17,333
Can you confirm that?

997
01:01:17,625 --> 01:01:19,083
- Oh, somebody telephoned, sir.

998
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:21,458
Yes, the bell rings
in my pantry here.

999
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:23,874
If anybody lifts the receiver
to dial a number,

1000
01:01:24,167 --> 01:01:25,666
there's a faint noise
on the bell here.

1001
01:01:25,959 --> 01:01:28,624
- Hmm, and about
this fellow Horbury, the valet,

1002
01:01:28,917 --> 01:01:30,166
he was definitely
out of the house

1003
01:01:30,459 --> 01:01:31,458
by a quarter past 8:00?

1004
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:33,041
- It was a bit before that,
I'd say, sir.

1005
01:01:33,334 --> 01:01:35,083
It was just after
the superintendent arrived.

1006
01:01:35,375 --> 01:01:37,791
I remember particularly
because he broke a coffee cup.

1007
01:01:38,084 --> 01:01:41,624
- Horbury broke a coffee cup?
How was that?

1008
01:01:41,917 --> 01:01:45,499
- He was just lifting it up,
admiring it, like,

1009
01:01:45,792 --> 01:01:46,749
and I happened to mention

1010
01:01:47,042 --> 01:01:49,708
that Superintendent Sugden
had arrived,

1011
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,499
and he just dropped it.

1012
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:56,124
- Did he, indeed?

1013
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:04,416
- Sit down, will you?

1014
01:02:07,209 --> 01:02:08,499
- I prefer to stand.

1015
01:02:08,792 --> 01:02:10,958
- Very well.

1016
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:14,749
It's about these telephone calls
on the night of the crime.

1017
01:02:15,042 --> 01:02:16,958
You put through a call
to Westeringham,

1018
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:18,333
I think you said,
Mr. Lee.

1019
01:02:18,625 --> 01:02:20,874
- To my agent
in the constituency, yes.

1020
01:02:21,167 --> 01:02:24,708
- Your call went through
at 7:56 exactly.

1021
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,499
- Well, I couldn't say
the exact time.

1022
01:02:26,792 --> 01:02:28,791
- Ah, but we can,
you see, Mr. Lee.

1023
01:02:29,084 --> 01:02:34,208
Your call was put through
at 7:56 and ended at 8:09.

1024
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:37,374
Your father was killed,
Mr. Lee, at about 8:15,

1025
01:02:37,667 --> 01:02:39,624
so I must ask you for
an account of your movements

1026
01:02:39,917 --> 01:02:41,124
during those six minutes.

1027
01:02:41,417 --> 01:02:45,541
- Well, the exchange
must have made a mistake.

1028
01:02:45,834 --> 01:02:49,166
Well, I may have just
finished telephoning.

1029
01:02:49,459 --> 01:02:52,791
I think I debated
making another call.

1030
01:02:53,084 --> 01:02:53,958
- You would hardly debate

1031
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:55,749
whether or not
to make a telephone call

1032
01:02:56,042 --> 01:02:57,291
for six minutes.

1033
01:02:57,584 --> 01:02:59,249
- Are you doubting my word?

1034
01:02:59,542 --> 01:03:02,291
- We do like these questions
answered, Mr. Lee,

1035
01:03:02,584 --> 01:03:03,791
in a murder case.

1036
01:03:04,084 --> 01:03:06,791
- I don't like your tone,
Chief Inspector.

1037
01:03:07,084 --> 01:03:08,833
- I'm sorry for that, Mr. Lee.

1038
01:03:09,125 --> 01:03:13,249
Mrs. Lee, I think you said
that you were telephoning

1039
01:03:13,542 --> 01:03:17,458
when the alarm broke out
and that, at that time,

1040
01:03:17,750 --> 01:03:19,958
you were alone in the study.

1041
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:22,374
- Telephoning?

1042
01:03:22,667 --> 01:03:24,624
You didn't telephone
from here.

1043
01:03:24,917 --> 01:03:26,458
- Didn't I?

1044
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:29,124
Um...I don't know.

1045
01:03:29,417 --> 01:03:31,166
I was so upset.

1046
01:03:31,459 --> 01:03:32,249
- Well, you stated that--

1047
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:34,124
- George,
don't let them bully me.

1048
01:03:34,417 --> 01:03:35,833
You know
if people shout at me,

1049
01:03:36,125 --> 01:03:38,124
I can't remember
anything at all.

1050
01:03:38,417 --> 01:03:40,624
I'm so upset.

1051
01:03:45,167 --> 01:03:46,708
- I won't have my wife
treated like this!

1052
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:47,791
It's disgraceful.

1053
01:03:48,084 --> 01:03:49,291
She's a very sensitive woman.

1054
01:03:49,584 --> 01:03:51,083
I warn you:

1055
01:03:51,375 --> 01:03:52,916
I shall have a question
asked in the House

1056
01:03:53,209 --> 01:03:55,958
about the bullying methods
of the police.

1057
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:01,791
- She'll be back.

1058
01:04:02,084 --> 01:04:03,458
- In about five minutes,
I should say.

1059
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:07,208
- When she's worked out
a story, eh, Poirot?

1060
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:12,791
- You know, Chief Inspector,
this case--

1061
01:04:13,084 --> 01:04:14,833
it certainly gives one to think,
n'est-ce pas?

1062
01:04:15,125 --> 01:04:17,249
- It gives one to think,
all right, Poirot.

1063
01:04:17,542 --> 01:04:18,624
- Puh!
Stop it!

1064
01:04:21,334 --> 01:04:22,249
- Oh!

1065
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:26,208
- Oh!

1066
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:28,791
Look at it, poor thing.

1067
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:33,083
It's what I picked up
in Grandfather's room.

1068
01:04:33,375 --> 01:04:38,416
He must have had a balloon too,
only his was a pink one.

1069
01:04:50,959 --> 01:04:54,999
- You seen a ghost
or something, Poirot?

1070
01:04:55,292 --> 01:05:00,666
- Chief Inspector, I might
just have done precisely that.

1071
01:05:49,834 --> 01:05:52,833
- Good-bye, sir.
- Good-bye, and merry Christmas.

1072
01:05:53,125 --> 01:05:54,374
Ah, Madame Lee.

1073
01:05:54,667 --> 01:05:56,416
- Monsieur Poirot.
- Hmm?

1074
01:05:56,709 --> 01:06:00,624
- Funnily enough,
I want a word with you.

1075
01:06:00,917 --> 01:06:05,541
I can trust you, I know,
Mr. Poirot.

1076
01:06:05,834 --> 01:06:08,291
You look so kind.

1077
01:06:08,584 --> 01:06:09,916
You see, there's--

1078
01:06:10,209 --> 01:06:13,083
this doesn't have to go
any further, does it?

1079
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:15,624
I mean, you don't have to tell
that awful policeman?

1080
01:06:18,917 --> 01:06:21,374
I wanted to telephone somebody.

1081
01:06:21,667 --> 01:06:23,624
A friend of mine.

1082
01:06:23,917 --> 01:06:25,624
A man.

1083
01:06:25,917 --> 01:06:28,791
And I didn't want
George to know about it.

1084
01:06:29,084 --> 01:06:30,499
I know it was wrong.

1085
01:06:30,792 --> 01:06:32,666
- I do not judge, madame.

1086
01:06:32,959 --> 01:06:35,291
- No.

1087
01:06:35,584 --> 01:06:37,666
Anyway, I went to telephone
after dinner,

1088
01:06:37,959 --> 01:06:39,958
when I thought George would be
safely in the dining room.

1089
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:41,333
- After seven years?

1090
01:06:41,625 --> 01:06:43,999
- But I've got these blokes
chasing me for cash!

1091
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:49,458
- And when I got there,
I heard him telephoning,

1092
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:51,499
so I waited.

1093
01:06:53,750 --> 01:06:55,041
- And where did you wait,
madame?

1094
01:06:55,334 --> 01:06:57,291
- There's a little place
for coats and hats and things

1095
01:06:57,584 --> 01:06:58,791
just by the door.

1096
01:06:59,084 --> 01:06:59,958
And I slipped back there

1097
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:02,041
where I could see George
come out of the study.

1098
01:07:02,334 --> 01:07:04,583
Only he didn't come out.

1099
01:07:04,875 --> 01:07:07,291
And then I heard all the noise,

1100
01:07:07,584 --> 01:07:11,124
and I heard Mr. Lee screaming.

1101
01:07:11,417 --> 01:07:14,291
Anyway, it would be
very, very awkward for me

1102
01:07:14,584 --> 01:07:16,708
to talk about this
in front of George.

1103
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,791
You do see that,
don't you?

1104
01:07:27,084 --> 01:07:28,249
- Here, Poirot!

1105
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:31,791
- At the back of the house!

1106
01:07:32,084 --> 01:07:33,916
- Listen to this.

1107
01:07:34,209 --> 01:07:35,458
- Good afternoon, sergeant.
- Sir.

1108
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:37,874
- Tell Mr. Poirot
what you just told me.

1109
01:07:38,167 --> 01:07:39,624
- Well, sir,
the superintendent asked me

1110
01:07:39,917 --> 01:07:41,333
to make a few inquiries,

1111
01:07:41,625 --> 01:07:43,541
like, about any reason
that Horbury might have

1112
01:07:43,834 --> 01:07:45,208
for being a bit careful
about the police.

1113
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:46,666
- Did you find any reason,
sergeant?

1114
01:07:46,959 --> 01:07:47,833
- That he did,

1115
01:07:48,125 --> 01:07:49,999
extorting money under threat
in Bedfordshire,

1116
01:07:50,292 --> 01:07:51,458
modified blackmail.

1117
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:53,958
The case couldn't be proved,
so he got off.

1118
01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:55,499
- Yeah, but he
could not have possibly

1119
01:07:55,792 --> 01:07:57,124
have committed the murder.

1120
01:07:57,417 --> 01:07:59,624
His ladyfriend says
he was at the cinema,

1121
01:07:59,917 --> 01:08:02,041
and everyone agrees that
he left the house before 8:00.

1122
01:08:02,334 --> 01:08:04,291
- Yes, I know.
Blessed infuriating.

1123
01:08:04,584 --> 01:08:06,208
Tell him the other thing,
Coombes.

1124
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:08,374
- Well, sir, we also made
an inquiry or two

1125
01:08:08,667 --> 01:08:09,874
about Mrs. George Lee.

1126
01:08:10,167 --> 01:08:11,041
- Ah.

1127
01:08:11,334 --> 01:08:12,291
- Magdalene Jones, as she was,

1128
01:08:12,584 --> 01:08:13,999
when she was living
with a Commander Jones

1129
01:08:14,292 --> 01:08:15,166
down in Hambledon,

1130
01:08:15,459 --> 01:08:16,666
passed her off
as his daughter,

1131
01:08:16,959 --> 01:08:17,916
only she wasn't.

1132
01:08:18,209 --> 01:08:19,124
- And before that,

1133
01:08:19,417 --> 01:08:21,416
she was Madeline Potts
of Willesden.

1134
01:08:21,709 --> 01:08:23,916
She left with most
of the commander's savings

1135
01:08:24,209 --> 01:08:26,791
and debts all over Hampshire.

1136
01:08:27,084 --> 01:08:28,291
- Huh.

1137
01:08:28,584 --> 01:08:30,291
Thank you very much, sergeant.

1138
01:08:30,584 --> 01:08:32,624
I do not think that that one
is as simple as she seems,

1139
01:08:32,917 --> 01:08:34,458
Chief Inspector.

1140
01:08:34,750 --> 01:08:35,666
On the night of the murder,

1141
01:08:35,959 --> 01:08:37,958
she said that she went
to telephone a man, hmm?

1142
01:08:38,250 --> 01:08:39,833
But she overheard
her husband on the telephone

1143
01:08:40,125 --> 01:08:41,583
and concealed herself
until he finished.

1144
01:08:41,875 --> 01:08:44,499
- Well, it sounds like
about her dap.

1145
01:08:50,417 --> 01:08:52,291
What are these blooming things,
Poirot?

1146
01:08:52,584 --> 01:08:55,624
- Ah, now, these are
the miniature gardens

1147
01:08:55,917 --> 01:08:57,249
of Madame Alfred Lee.

1148
01:08:57,542 --> 01:08:59,624
- What's the point of having
a miniature garden?

1149
01:08:59,917 --> 01:09:01,624
I mean, you can't do
anything with it, can you?

1150
01:09:01,917 --> 01:09:04,583
You can't take a deck chair out
and sit in it.

1151
01:09:04,875 --> 01:09:06,999
- They are art, Chief Inspector.

1152
01:09:07,292 --> 01:09:09,458
See here?

1153
01:09:09,750 --> 01:09:13,166
This one is a vineyard italien.

1154
01:09:13,459 --> 01:09:16,624
And this one is
the garden Japanese.

1155
01:09:16,917 --> 01:09:18,458
- Well, it's just stones,
isn't it?

1156
01:09:18,750 --> 01:09:21,624
I mean, I know the Japanese
are peculiar, but...

1157
01:09:25,584 --> 01:09:26,874
What are you looking at?

1158
01:09:31,209 --> 01:09:32,999
What is it?

1159
01:09:35,042 --> 01:09:37,458
It's a stone.

1160
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:39,249
Very nice.

1161
01:09:43,667 --> 01:09:46,249
- Nicer than you think,
Chief Inspector.

1162
01:09:58,417 --> 01:10:01,666
- Little frog's been doing
his Christmas shopping.

1163
01:10:01,959 --> 01:10:03,624
- I want to see
what he has brought for me.

1164
01:10:03,917 --> 01:10:06,249
- Steady on!

1165
01:10:06,542 --> 01:10:07,999
- Oh, it's not for me, I think.

1166
01:10:08,292 --> 01:10:10,208
- What the devil is it?

1167
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:12,791
- It is an imitation moustache.

1168
01:10:13,084 --> 01:10:16,499
- I knew that thing of his
couldn't be real.

1169
01:10:21,042 --> 01:10:22,249
- What is it?

1170
01:10:22,542 --> 01:10:24,541
- We'd like a word, Mrs. Lee,
if that's convenient.

1171
01:10:24,834 --> 01:10:26,541
- Oh, yes, all right.

1172
01:10:26,834 --> 01:10:29,041
I'll come out.

1173
01:10:29,334 --> 01:10:30,791
I'm sorry.
Alfred's resting.

1174
01:10:31,084 --> 01:10:33,374
He had very little sleep
last night.

1175
01:10:33,667 --> 01:10:35,249
Would you come through here?

1176
01:10:38,917 --> 01:10:40,124
This is his mother's old room.

1177
01:10:40,417 --> 01:10:43,291
It hasn't been touched
since she died.

1178
01:10:43,584 --> 01:10:45,958
- Tell me, madame,
your husband,

1179
01:10:46,250 --> 01:10:47,458
he was very attached
to his mother?

1180
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:48,749
- He adored her.

1181
01:10:49,042 --> 01:10:52,249
- We were wondering
if you can explain these.

1182
01:10:52,542 --> 01:10:53,374
- What are they?

1183
01:10:53,667 --> 01:10:54,958
- Uncut diamonds, Mrs. Lee.

1184
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:57,541
We found them
in your Japanese garden.

1185
01:10:57,834 --> 01:11:00,374
- My dear Chief Inspector,
if I'd stolen the diamonds,

1186
01:11:00,667 --> 01:11:02,499
I would have just dug a hole
in a flowerbed somewhere

1187
01:11:02,792 --> 01:11:05,208
and buried them there.

1188
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:06,666
Have you still
really no idea

1189
01:11:06,959 --> 01:11:08,374
who could have done
this awful murder?

1190
01:11:08,667 --> 01:11:10,624
- We got more idea
who didn't do it.

1191
01:11:10,917 --> 01:11:12,666
- Oh, please, God,
let it be a stranger,

1192
01:11:12,959 --> 01:11:16,083
not a member of the family.

1193
01:11:16,375 --> 01:11:18,541
- It might be both.

1194
01:11:18,834 --> 01:11:20,458
- What do you mean?

1195
01:11:20,750 --> 01:11:22,291
- It might be
a member of the family

1196
01:11:22,584 --> 01:11:26,749
and at the same time
a stranger.

1197
01:11:27,042 --> 01:11:28,208
It is merely a little idea

1198
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:31,416
that has occurred
to the mind of Hercule Poirot.

1199
01:11:34,584 --> 01:11:36,541
- The official reading
of the will

1200
01:11:36,834 --> 01:11:37,958
generally takes place

1201
01:11:38,250 --> 01:11:40,791
after the funeral
of the deceased.

1202
01:11:41,084 --> 01:11:44,291
However, as that will not now be
until after the inquest,

1203
01:11:44,584 --> 01:11:46,624
I have been asked to give you
the bare bones

1204
01:11:46,917 --> 01:11:49,166
of Mr. Simeon Lee's
testament now.

1205
01:11:49,459 --> 01:11:51,458
- Asked by whom?

1206
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:54,458
- Interested parties, Mr. Lee.

1207
01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:56,291
The main provisions of the will,

1208
01:11:56,584 --> 01:11:59,749
which was made ten years ago,
are quite simple.

1209
01:12:00,042 --> 01:12:04,208
Half Mr. Simeon Lee's property
goes to his son, Mr. Alfred Lee.

1210
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:07,666
The remainder is divided equally
between his other children.

1211
01:12:07,959 --> 01:12:10,958
- Alfred's struck lucky again,
as per usual!

1212
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:13,458
Half the old man's fortune!

1213
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:15,166
- You ought to think
yourself lucky

1214
01:12:15,459 --> 01:12:18,291
my father left you
anything at all.

1215
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:20,958
- Well, I don't think
I need to go any further.

1216
01:12:21,250 --> 01:12:22,291
- What about Pilar?

1217
01:12:22,584 --> 01:12:24,833
- Miss Estravados
is not mentioned in the will.

1218
01:12:25,125 --> 01:12:27,791
- Doesn't she get
her mother's share?

1219
01:12:28,084 --> 01:12:30,291
- Jennifer Estravados,
if she had lived,

1220
01:12:30,584 --> 01:12:32,499
would, of course, have received
her equal share

1221
01:12:32,792 --> 01:12:33,958
with the rest of you.

1222
01:12:34,250 --> 01:12:36,791
As she is dead, the portion
that would have been hers

1223
01:12:37,084 --> 01:12:39,958
goes back into the estate
to be shared out between you.

1224
01:12:40,250 --> 01:12:43,749
- Then...I have nothing?

1225
01:12:44,042 --> 01:12:46,083
- Oh, my dear, the family
will see to that, of course.

1226
01:12:46,375 --> 01:12:48,624
- I think she ought to get
Jennifer's whack.

1227
01:12:48,917 --> 01:12:51,624
- Well, I really must be going.

1228
01:12:51,917 --> 01:12:53,249
Good-bye, Mrs. Lee.

1229
01:12:53,542 --> 01:12:57,249
Anything I can do,
please consult me at any time.

1230
01:13:00,542 --> 01:13:01,624
- I agree with Harry.

1231
01:13:01,917 --> 01:13:04,666
I think Pilar is entitled
to a definite share.

1232
01:13:04,959 --> 01:13:07,291
I mean, this will was made years
before Jennifer's death.

1233
01:13:07,584 --> 01:13:10,458
- The law is the law,
I'm afraid.

1234
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:12,499
We must abide by it.

1235
01:13:12,792 --> 01:13:14,749
Yes, we're all
very sorry for Pilar,

1236
01:13:15,042 --> 01:13:18,291
but as George says,
the law is the law.

1237
01:13:18,584 --> 01:13:20,916
- My dear, this must be
very unpleasant for you.

1238
01:13:21,209 --> 01:13:23,416
Would you please leave us
while we discuss the question?

1239
01:13:23,709 --> 01:13:26,541
- Yes.

1240
01:13:26,834 --> 01:13:28,999
Yes, very well.

1241
01:13:37,834 --> 01:13:41,124
- Well, gentlemen,
you've heard what you came for.

1242
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:45,374
This is family business now.

1243
01:13:57,250 --> 01:14:02,124
You really are a skinflint,
George, aren't you, huh?

1244
01:14:02,417 --> 01:14:04,416
- At least I'm not a sponger.

1245
01:14:04,709 --> 01:14:07,708
- You have battened on Dad
these last 30 years!

1246
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,791
- As an elected member
of his Majesty's Parliament--

1247
01:14:11,084 --> 01:14:15,041
- Can we please discuss this
sanely and quietly?

1248
01:14:15,334 --> 01:14:16,291
- Yes.

1249
01:14:16,584 --> 01:14:18,041
Jennifer only died
last year.

1250
01:14:18,334 --> 01:14:21,124
I am sure that when Simeon sent
for Mr. Charlton,

1251
01:14:21,417 --> 01:14:23,624
he intended to make provision
for Pilar in a new will.

1252
01:14:23,917 --> 01:14:26,458
I think we should carry out what
we can assume were his wishes.

1253
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:28,333
- I agree.
- Certainly not!

1254
01:14:28,625 --> 01:14:29,791
The whole thing's preposterous.

1255
01:14:30,084 --> 01:14:32,124
- Considering George is
the only person in this family

1256
01:14:32,417 --> 01:14:33,624
who has done anything
in the world,

1257
01:14:33,917 --> 01:14:36,124
I think it's shameful
his father left him so little.

1258
01:14:36,417 --> 01:14:38,291
- Well, that's clear enough.

1259
01:14:38,584 --> 01:14:41,958
Of the family, Alfred and I are
in favor of the motion.

1260
01:14:42,250 --> 01:14:43,333
George is against.

1261
01:14:43,625 --> 01:14:44,833
The ayes have it.

1262
01:14:45,125 --> 01:14:47,541
- There isn't any question
of ayes or noes.

1263
01:14:47,834 --> 01:14:51,374
My share of my father's estate
is mine absolutely.

1264
01:14:51,667 --> 01:14:54,458
I shall not part
with one penny of it.

1265
01:15:06,917 --> 01:15:08,916
- So who profits
by the fact that Simeon Lee

1266
01:15:09,209 --> 01:15:10,791
didn't have time
to alter his will?

1267
01:15:11,084 --> 01:15:14,583
- All of them,
except the Spanish girl.

1268
01:15:14,875 --> 01:15:16,416
- So we can cross her
off the list then?

1269
01:15:16,709 --> 01:15:19,833
- Yes.

1270
01:15:20,125 --> 01:15:22,624
Well, maybe.

1271
01:15:27,917 --> 01:15:29,333
- No!
I will not!

1272
01:15:29,625 --> 01:15:31,624
- It's your right, Pilar,
your blood right!

1273
01:15:31,917 --> 01:15:32,958
- You speak like that!

1274
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:34,624
That is why
I cannot do it!

1275
01:15:34,917 --> 01:15:37,291
- But it's not a matter
of charity; it's justice!

1276
01:15:37,584 --> 01:15:39,583
- You have all
spoiled everything.

1277
01:15:39,875 --> 01:15:41,166
I am going away.

1278
01:15:41,459 --> 01:15:44,499
Now.
At once.

1279
01:15:44,792 --> 01:15:49,624
You will not be troubled
by me no more.

1280
01:15:49,917 --> 01:15:51,624
- Now, the matter
of your passport, Miss--

1281
01:15:51,917 --> 01:15:53,583
- Go to hell!

1282
01:15:57,750 --> 01:15:59,041
- What's going on?

1283
01:15:59,334 --> 01:16:00,666
- It's a family matter.

1284
01:16:00,959 --> 01:16:02,291
I'm sorry.

1285
01:16:02,584 --> 01:16:04,124
Alfred and I had agreed
to settle a third

1286
01:16:04,417 --> 01:16:05,916
of our share
of the estate on her.

1287
01:16:06,209 --> 01:16:07,874
She refused to take it.

1288
01:16:30,334 --> 01:16:32,333
- She is still alive.

1289
01:19:12,042 --> 01:19:12,958
- Good morning, Tressilian.

1290
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:14,708
- Good morning, sir.

1291
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:15,958
- Merry Christmas.

1292
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:18,916
- Oh, thank you, sir.

1293
01:19:21,042 --> 01:19:25,583
- Hercule, have you heard
how the girl is this morning?

1294
01:19:25,875 --> 01:19:28,124
- Merry Christmas to you,
Monsieur Harry.

1295
01:19:28,417 --> 01:19:32,416
Yes, Mademoiselle Estravados,
she sleeps peacefully.

1296
01:19:32,709 --> 01:19:35,291
She has, I think,
the clavicle that is broken.

1297
01:19:35,584 --> 01:19:37,916
- Mm, yes, yes, I heard all that
from the doc last night.

1298
01:19:38,209 --> 01:19:41,416
But I mean, who would want
to do such a thing?

1299
01:19:41,709 --> 01:19:42,499
- Ah.

1300
01:19:44,959 --> 01:19:47,083
Excuse me.

1301
01:19:57,917 --> 01:19:59,333
- What have you got to tell me
then, Poirot?

1302
01:19:59,625 --> 01:20:01,124
- It is most interesting,
Chief Inspector.

1303
01:20:01,417 --> 01:20:02,874
I went into the room
of Mademoiselle Pilar.

1304
01:20:03,167 --> 01:20:05,916
I opened the drawer,
and I took out her passport,

1305
01:20:06,209 --> 01:20:09,291
and, Chief Inspector...

1306
01:20:38,542 --> 01:20:40,583
- What's the meaning
of all this?

1307
01:20:43,917 --> 01:20:45,749
- Merry Christmas, Maggie.

1308
01:20:47,875 --> 01:20:48,791
- Good morning.

1309
01:20:49,084 --> 01:20:51,416
Please to come in now.

1310
01:21:08,959 --> 01:21:13,374
Please to make yourselves
as comfortable as possible.

1311
01:21:13,667 --> 01:21:15,833
Mademoiselle...Estravados

1312
01:21:16,125 --> 01:21:20,124
has something
that she wishes to say to you.

1313
01:21:20,417 --> 01:21:26,374
- You think I am your niece,
Pilar Estravados.

1314
01:21:26,667 --> 01:21:28,791
That is not so.

1315
01:21:29,084 --> 01:21:31,124
- I don't understand, Pilar.

1316
01:21:31,417 --> 01:21:35,166
- I would not have told you,
not ever,

1317
01:21:35,459 --> 01:21:36,666
but for the money.

1318
01:21:36,959 --> 01:21:40,916
To come here and pretend
and cheat and act,

1319
01:21:41,209 --> 01:21:43,958
that was fun.

1320
01:21:44,250 --> 01:21:47,416
But when Lydia said
that the money was mine

1321
01:21:47,709 --> 01:21:52,458
and that it was only justice,
it was not fun any longer.

1322
01:21:52,750 --> 01:21:54,083
I am sorry.

1323
01:21:54,375 --> 01:21:57,583
Pilar was killed
when I was traveling with her

1324
01:21:57,875 --> 01:22:00,916
in her car in Spain.

1325
01:22:01,209 --> 01:22:03,416
And I had not much money
and nowhere to go,

1326
01:22:03,709 --> 01:22:05,458
and I thought,

1327
01:22:05,750 --> 01:22:07,833
"Why should I not go to England
and become rich?"

1328
01:22:08,125 --> 01:22:10,624
And when it began, it was fun,
wondering if I could--

1329
01:22:10,917 --> 01:22:12,458
- This is preposterous!

1330
01:22:12,750 --> 01:22:14,124
This is criminal!

1331
01:22:14,417 --> 01:22:15,958
Getting money
by false pretenses!

1332
01:22:16,250 --> 01:22:18,833
- Well, she didn't get much
from you, old boy, did she?

1333
01:22:19,125 --> 01:22:23,291
So...I'm not
your uncle anymore, eh?

1334
01:22:23,584 --> 01:22:26,124
- I'm afraid it's rather
more serious than that.

1335
01:22:26,417 --> 01:22:29,624
If she could lie about that,
she could lie about anything.

1336
01:22:29,917 --> 01:22:31,624
I'll tell you
what I think, Miss...

1337
01:22:31,917 --> 01:22:33,458
what's your name?

1338
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:35,916
- López.

1339
01:22:36,209 --> 01:22:37,291
Conchita López.

1340
01:22:37,584 --> 01:22:39,083
- Very well, Miss López,

1341
01:22:39,375 --> 01:22:41,166
I'll tell you
what I think happened.

1342
01:22:41,459 --> 01:22:43,249
When Mr. Lee found
that the diamonds were missing,

1343
01:22:43,542 --> 01:22:44,833
he sent word for you
to come and see him

1344
01:22:45,125 --> 01:22:46,291
immediately after dinner.

1345
01:22:46,584 --> 01:22:48,958
You did so,
and he accused you of the theft.

1346
01:22:49,250 --> 01:22:50,291
You denied it.

1347
01:22:50,584 --> 01:22:52,791
- No!
This is not true.

1348
01:22:53,084 --> 01:22:56,291
I left the drawing room
after dinner.

1349
01:22:56,584 --> 01:22:58,333
I came up here to my room.

1350
01:22:58,625 --> 01:22:59,666
I wanted a clean handkerchief.

1351
01:22:59,959 --> 01:23:03,166
But then I thought
I would go and see the old man.

1352
01:23:05,792 --> 01:23:08,416
I thought he would be pleased.

1353
01:23:08,709 --> 01:23:10,416
But when I turned out
onto the stairs,

1354
01:23:10,709 --> 01:23:16,166
I saw that someone else
was there at his door.

1355
01:23:16,459 --> 01:23:17,791
I slipped back into the corridor

1356
01:23:18,084 --> 01:23:21,458
in case the person
turned around.

1357
01:23:21,750 --> 01:23:23,916
I did not want them to think
that I was...

1358
01:23:24,209 --> 01:23:24,999
I don't know the word.

1359
01:23:25,292 --> 01:23:27,458
- Ingratiating yourself?

1360
01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:29,458
- Yes?
- No.

1361
01:23:29,750 --> 01:23:31,666
Go on, Pilar--
Conchita.

1362
01:23:31,959 --> 01:23:35,666
- I heard those horrible noises,
crashes, screams.

1363
01:23:35,959 --> 01:23:37,624
And when the people
came running,

1364
01:23:37,917 --> 01:23:39,458
I came out at the end
and joined them.

1365
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:40,791
- Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1366
01:23:41,084 --> 01:23:42,749
This is all very airy-fairy.

1367
01:23:43,042 --> 01:23:46,499
You say you saw someone standing
outside Simeon Lee's door.

1368
01:23:46,792 --> 01:23:48,124
Who did you see?

1369
01:23:48,417 --> 01:23:51,541
- I do not know who it was.

1370
01:23:51,834 --> 01:23:54,916
It was too dimly lit to see,
but...

1371
01:23:55,209 --> 01:23:56,083
it was a woman.

1372
01:23:56,375 --> 01:23:57,416
- Rubbish!

1373
01:23:57,709 --> 01:24:00,291
She's just saying anything
to get off the hook.

1374
01:24:00,584 --> 01:24:04,708
I always said an outsider
killed my father.

1375
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:09,791
- In my opinion,
Simeon Lee, your father,

1376
01:24:10,084 --> 01:24:12,833
he was killed
by his own flesh and blood.

1377
01:24:13,125 --> 01:24:15,249
- One of us?

1378
01:24:15,542 --> 01:24:16,416
I deny that.

1379
01:24:16,709 --> 01:24:17,999
- Oh, yes.

1380
01:24:18,292 --> 01:24:22,958
There is a case against
every person in this room.

1381
01:24:23,250 --> 01:24:24,458
- Nonsense.

1382
01:24:24,750 --> 01:24:26,958
Balderdash!

1383
01:24:27,250 --> 01:24:31,291
- Et bien.

1384
01:24:31,584 --> 01:24:33,791
I will begin with the case
against you,

1385
01:24:34,084 --> 01:24:35,291
Monsieur George Lee.

1386
01:24:35,584 --> 01:24:36,541
- Now, wait a minute!

1387
01:24:36,834 --> 01:24:38,624
- You had no love
for your father.

1388
01:24:38,917 --> 01:24:42,291
You kept on good terms with him
for the sake of money.

1389
01:24:42,584 --> 01:24:43,458
On the day that he died,

1390
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:45,166
he threatened to cut down
your allowance.

1391
01:24:45,459 --> 01:24:46,583
But you knew that when he died,

1392
01:24:46,875 --> 01:24:48,999
you would probably inherit
a sum most substantial.

1393
01:24:49,292 --> 01:24:50,791
And there is your motive.

1394
01:24:51,084 --> 01:24:51,958
- I never heard such--

1395
01:24:52,250 --> 01:24:53,666
- After dinner,
you went to telephone.

1396
01:24:53,959 --> 01:24:56,916
This telephone call
lasted 13 minutes.

1397
01:25:02,584 --> 01:25:04,666
You could then have easily
visited the room of your father

1398
01:25:04,959 --> 01:25:07,624
and killed him.

1399
01:25:07,917 --> 01:25:11,958
Afterwards, you left the room,
turned the key from the outside

1400
01:25:12,250 --> 01:25:13,416
in the hope
that the whole affair

1401
01:25:13,709 --> 01:25:14,958
would look like
that of a burglar.

1402
01:25:15,250 --> 01:25:16,249
But you omitted,
in your panic,

1403
01:25:16,542 --> 01:25:18,499
to make sure that the window,
it was left open

1404
01:25:18,792 --> 01:25:20,624
to support
this burglar theory.

1405
01:25:20,917 --> 01:25:22,791
And that was stupid,
but you are,

1406
01:25:23,084 --> 01:25:24,208
you will pardon me
for saying so,

1407
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:25,624
rather a stupid man.

1408
01:25:25,917 --> 01:25:27,249
But, you know,
many other stupid men

1409
01:25:27,542 --> 01:25:28,624
have become criminals.

1410
01:25:28,917 --> 01:25:30,416
- How dare you speak
to my husband like that!

1411
01:25:30,709 --> 01:25:31,499
- Ah, yes.

1412
01:25:31,792 --> 01:25:37,249
Then there is,
of course, Madame Lee.

1413
01:25:37,542 --> 01:25:39,791
She also had a motive.

1414
01:25:40,084 --> 01:25:41,833
She is, I think, in debt.

1415
01:25:42,125 --> 01:25:43,874
And the tone of the remarks
made by Simeon Lee

1416
01:25:44,167 --> 01:25:45,833
would have caused her
some uneasiness.

1417
01:25:46,125 --> 01:25:47,458
- Roger, you know this...

1418
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:50,458
- She also has no alibi.

1419
01:25:50,750 --> 01:25:51,958
She said she went
to the telephone,

1420
01:25:52,250 --> 01:25:54,291
but did she, in fact,
make a call?

1421
01:25:54,584 --> 01:25:57,666
And in any case, we only have
her word for what she did.

1422
01:26:00,084 --> 01:26:02,958
- I suppose it's our turn now.

1423
01:26:03,250 --> 01:26:04,958
Now, how do you suggest

1424
01:26:05,250 --> 01:26:08,124
that dear Alfred
killed his beloved father

1425
01:26:08,417 --> 01:26:12,666
when we were both together
in the dining room at the time?

1426
01:26:12,959 --> 01:26:18,458
- Et bien, that is very simple,
monsieur.

1427
01:26:18,750 --> 01:26:20,958
You and your brother are on the
terms very bad, n'est-ce pas?

1428
01:26:21,250 --> 01:26:22,624
Oh, that is well-known.

1429
01:26:22,917 --> 01:26:24,333
But let us suppose
that these bad terms

1430
01:26:24,625 --> 01:26:25,999
were all part
of a clever plot.

1431
01:26:26,292 --> 01:26:27,458
Let us suppose
that you and he

1432
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:29,583
had got together
some time before.

1433
01:26:29,875 --> 01:26:32,249
And then comes
the night of the murder,

1434
01:26:32,542 --> 01:26:36,291
which, together,
you have planned so cleverly.

1435
01:26:36,584 --> 01:26:37,958
One of you remains
in the dining room,

1436
01:26:38,250 --> 01:26:39,999
talking out loud
and quarreling,

1437
01:26:40,292 --> 01:26:41,499
to make it appear
as though there were

1438
01:26:41,792 --> 01:26:43,749
two people in the room,

1439
01:26:44,042 --> 01:26:44,874
while the other brother,

1440
01:26:45,167 --> 01:26:47,791
he goes upstairs
and commits the crime.

1441
01:26:48,084 --> 01:26:49,791
- I mean,
I don't think you understand.

1442
01:26:50,084 --> 01:26:52,791
You devil!

1443
01:26:53,084 --> 01:26:55,583
- But what if it was not a woman
that Mademoiselle López saw

1444
01:26:55,875 --> 01:26:57,333
outside the room of Simeon Lee?

1445
01:26:57,625 --> 01:27:00,291
What if Mademoiselle López
is again lying,

1446
01:27:00,584 --> 01:27:01,583
but this time
to support a man

1447
01:27:01,875 --> 01:27:03,166
of whom she has grown
rather fond?

1448
01:27:03,459 --> 01:27:04,291
- Now, look!

1449
01:27:04,584 --> 01:27:05,416
- No, you're wrong.

1450
01:27:05,709 --> 01:27:08,666
It was me that Pilar saw.

1451
01:27:08,959 --> 01:27:10,333
- You, Lydia?

1452
01:27:10,625 --> 01:27:13,791
- I can't believe
I've been such a coward,

1453
01:27:14,084 --> 01:27:16,583
to keep silent
just because I was afraid.

1454
01:27:16,875 --> 01:27:18,916
- I think you'd better
tell us now, Mrs. Lee.

1455
01:27:19,209 --> 01:27:23,291
- I'd been thinking all evening
about the unpleasant scene

1456
01:27:23,584 --> 01:27:28,166
we'd had with Simeon
before dinner.

1457
01:27:28,459 --> 01:27:31,124
When Pilar--
I'm sorry, Conchita--

1458
01:27:31,417 --> 01:27:32,791
left the drawing room,

1459
01:27:33,084 --> 01:27:35,249
I decided to go up
and see him.

1460
01:27:39,209 --> 01:27:40,624
I was going to be firm
with him.

1461
01:27:40,917 --> 01:27:44,124
I was going to tell him
that Alfred and I were leaving.

1462
01:27:44,417 --> 01:27:45,666
- Lydia!

1463
01:27:45,959 --> 01:27:46,958
- Yes, yes, I was!

1464
01:27:47,250 --> 01:27:50,208
I'd had enough humiliation,
Alfred.

1465
01:27:53,917 --> 01:27:56,083
I knocked
on Simeon's door.

1466
01:27:56,375 --> 01:27:57,458
There was no answer.

1467
01:27:57,750 --> 01:27:59,083
I knocked again.

1468
01:27:59,375 --> 01:28:00,916
Still no answer.

1469
01:28:01,209 --> 01:28:03,291
I tried the door handle.

1470
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:06,291
And the door was locked.

1471
01:28:06,584 --> 01:28:11,708
Then those terrible noises
started inside the room.

1472
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:16,791
I stood there, paralyzed.

1473
01:28:17,084 --> 01:28:19,374
And then Alfred
and the others came running

1474
01:28:19,667 --> 01:28:23,958
and battered down the door,
and we saw inside the room.

1475
01:28:24,250 --> 01:28:27,624
And there was no one there.

1476
01:28:27,917 --> 01:28:30,374
Just Simeon lying dead.

1477
01:28:30,667 --> 01:28:32,291
There was no one else there.

1478
01:28:32,584 --> 01:28:35,291
Do you understand me?

1479
01:28:35,584 --> 01:28:38,291
And no one had come out.

1480
01:28:38,584 --> 01:28:40,916
- And all this time,
you've said nothing.

1481
01:28:41,209 --> 01:28:42,124
- No!

1482
01:28:42,417 --> 01:28:43,374
Because if I had,

1483
01:28:43,667 --> 01:28:45,624
there is only one thing
that you could have thought:

1484
01:28:45,917 --> 01:28:47,499
that I had killed
my father-in-law.

1485
01:28:47,792 --> 01:28:50,124
- Non, non, non, non, madame.

1486
01:28:50,417 --> 01:28:52,208
When you heard those screams
most awful,

1487
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:54,249
when you heard the sounds
of the struggle,

1488
01:28:54,542 --> 01:28:55,958
Simeon Lee was already dead.

1489
01:28:56,250 --> 01:28:58,166
- Already dead?

1490
01:28:58,459 --> 01:29:00,624
What do you mean,
already dead?

1491
01:29:00,917 --> 01:29:02,416
- Did I not tell to you,
Chief Inspector,

1492
01:29:02,709 --> 01:29:05,999
that I thought
I had seen a ghost?

1493
01:29:06,292 --> 01:29:07,749
The first intimation
I had of this

1494
01:29:08,042 --> 01:29:09,791
was when I visited
the shop in the village.

1495
01:29:10,084 --> 01:29:11,458
And the owner of this shop,

1496
01:29:11,750 --> 01:29:14,833
he is a fellow most jovial,
n'est-ce pas?

1497
01:29:15,125 --> 01:29:18,416
He delights in
the childish pranks and...

1498
01:29:18,709 --> 01:29:21,416
how do you say, la blague?

1499
01:29:21,709 --> 01:29:23,624
The practical tricks.

1500
01:29:23,917 --> 01:29:24,958
- You're not trying
to tell us

1501
01:29:25,250 --> 01:29:27,458
that this was all
a practical joke?

1502
01:29:27,750 --> 01:29:29,708
- Non, non, non, madame,
not a joke,

1503
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,958
but a trick most deadly.

1504
01:29:33,250 --> 01:29:35,916
The killing itself was simple.

1505
01:29:44,417 --> 01:29:46,749
Our murderer sets the scene.

1506
01:29:47,042 --> 01:29:48,666
The diamonds are taken
from the safe,

1507
01:29:48,959 --> 01:29:51,916
which had already been opened
by Simeon Lee.

1508
01:29:53,959 --> 01:29:55,291
As much furniture as possible

1509
01:29:55,584 --> 01:29:58,374
is piled in the center
of the room like a tower.

1510
01:30:02,625 --> 01:30:05,541
Then a strong,
thin length of cord

1511
01:30:05,834 --> 01:30:08,541
is tied around this tower.

1512
01:30:16,375 --> 01:30:18,291
The two ends of the cord
are then passed

1513
01:30:18,584 --> 01:30:21,499
through the narrow gap
in the window

1514
01:30:21,792 --> 01:30:24,874
and allowed to drop
to the ground below.

1515
01:30:27,084 --> 01:30:29,583
The door, it is locked
from the outside.

1516
01:30:35,125 --> 01:30:38,083
The stage, it is set.

1517
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:41,958
Our murderer walks
casually away,

1518
01:30:42,250 --> 01:30:44,333
waits a little while,

1519
01:30:44,625 --> 01:30:46,958
then returns to the wall
below the window

1520
01:30:47,250 --> 01:30:51,208
and takes up the slack
on both ends of the cord.

1521
01:30:54,917 --> 01:30:57,374
And now, at last,
the perpetrator has prepared

1522
01:30:57,667 --> 01:31:00,999
the final element
in his ruthless plot.

1523
01:31:06,250 --> 01:31:07,166
- But the scream?

1524
01:31:07,459 --> 01:31:08,291
The terrible scream?

1525
01:31:08,584 --> 01:31:09,416
- Ah, yes, of course,

1526
01:31:09,709 --> 01:31:11,791
the dying screams
of Simeon Lee,

1527
01:31:12,084 --> 01:31:13,458
the cry of a man
in mortal agony,

1528
01:31:13,750 --> 01:31:16,249
a soul in hell.

1529
01:31:16,542 --> 01:31:18,083
Monsieur Harry Lee
came closest to it

1530
01:31:18,375 --> 01:31:20,791
when he described that sound
as that of the killing of a pig.

1531
01:31:21,084 --> 01:31:22,958
And it was here that
my friend in the village shop

1532
01:31:23,250 --> 01:31:25,458
unwittingly played his part.

1533
01:31:29,084 --> 01:31:30,791
- Morning.

1534
01:31:31,084 --> 01:31:34,041
- In that establishment
most eccentric,

1535
01:31:34,334 --> 01:31:36,624
the owner sells
long pink bladders,

1536
01:31:36,917 --> 01:31:40,416
which have painted
on them faces.

1537
01:31:40,709 --> 01:31:43,916
These are called Dying Pigs.

1538
01:31:44,209 --> 01:31:45,416
They are blown up
like a balloon,

1539
01:31:45,709 --> 01:31:48,624
and the little wooden peg
is placed in one end

1540
01:31:48,917 --> 01:31:50,624
to prevent the escape of air.

1541
01:31:50,917 --> 01:31:53,458
Our murderer had placed
in the room

1542
01:31:53,750 --> 01:31:54,791
one of these balloons

1543
01:31:55,084 --> 01:31:59,249
and had attached the cord
to the little wooden peg.

1544
01:32:16,250 --> 01:32:17,458
His plan accomplished,

1545
01:32:17,750 --> 01:32:20,624
our murderer then pulls
the remains of the Dying Pig

1546
01:32:20,917 --> 01:32:22,458
out through the window,

1547
01:32:22,750 --> 01:32:25,874
leaving behind only
the little wooden peg

1548
01:32:26,167 --> 01:32:29,499
and a telltale fragment
of the balloon.

1549
01:32:31,667 --> 01:32:32,458
But you know,

1550
01:32:32,750 --> 01:32:34,333
the most valuable clue
in this case

1551
01:32:34,625 --> 01:32:37,541
was uttered quite unknowingly
by the butler, Tressilian.

1552
01:32:37,834 --> 01:32:41,416
He said that he felt strange.

1553
01:32:41,709 --> 01:32:43,583
He said that he felt
that things were happening

1554
01:32:43,875 --> 01:32:46,041
that had happened before.

1555
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,624
And it was one
very simple occurrence

1556
01:32:50,917 --> 01:32:52,958
that gave to him
this feeling most strange.

1557
01:32:53,250 --> 01:32:55,458
It was when he met
Monsieur Harry Lee,

1558
01:32:55,750 --> 01:32:57,999
when Monsieur Harry Lee
first entered the house.

1559
01:32:58,292 --> 01:32:59,291
Bless my soul.

1560
01:32:59,584 --> 01:33:00,624
If it ain't Tressilian!

1561
01:33:00,917 --> 01:33:02,791
- Mr. Harry!

1562
01:33:03,084 --> 01:33:04,958
- And when you look at the face
of Monsieur Harry Lee,

1563
01:33:05,250 --> 01:33:06,458
you can see why.

1564
01:33:06,750 --> 01:33:08,458
- What the devil do you mean?

1565
01:33:08,750 --> 01:33:10,458
- In the face,

1566
01:33:10,750 --> 01:33:14,374
Monsieur Harry Lee
closely resembled his father.

1567
01:33:14,667 --> 01:33:16,458
But the similarity
is quite striking

1568
01:33:16,750 --> 01:33:18,749
when one observes the portrait
of Monsieur Simeon Lee

1569
01:33:19,042 --> 01:33:20,124
in the sitting room.

1570
01:33:20,417 --> 01:33:22,708
En effet, all of the men
in the Lee family

1571
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,749
have a likeness
that is most strong.

1572
01:33:30,625 --> 01:33:31,833
- All right, Poirot.

1573
01:33:32,125 --> 01:33:33,833
All very clever,
no doubt.

1574
01:33:34,125 --> 01:33:36,791
But who is this murderer
we keep hearing about?

1575
01:33:37,084 --> 01:33:39,541
- Ah, the good
Chief Inspector Japp

1576
01:33:39,834 --> 01:33:42,958
always the one to make Poirot
stick to his task.

1577
01:33:43,250 --> 01:33:44,166
Et bien, Chief Inspector,

1578
01:33:44,459 --> 01:33:45,624
in order to answer
your question,

1579
01:33:45,917 --> 01:33:49,166
it is necessary that we make
a short journey.

1580
01:34:05,792 --> 01:34:08,166
Suivez-moi.

1581
01:34:12,417 --> 01:34:15,124
- I hope you know
what you're up to, Poirot.

1582
01:34:19,792 --> 01:34:22,124
- Bonjour, Madame de Zuigder.

1583
01:34:22,417 --> 01:34:25,958
We would like to see your son,
if you please.

1584
01:34:26,250 --> 01:34:28,291
- Oh, God.

1585
01:34:33,625 --> 01:34:37,749
- This was indeed the death
of an evil man.

1586
01:34:38,042 --> 01:34:41,458
Remember the reputation
of Simeon Lee?

1587
01:34:41,750 --> 01:34:43,124
How he broke
the heart of his wife

1588
01:34:43,417 --> 01:34:46,541
because of his numerous affairs
with other women?

1589
01:34:46,834 --> 01:34:47,833
Remember, also, his boasts

1590
01:34:48,125 --> 01:34:52,416
of the illegitimate sons
that he had sired.

1591
01:34:52,709 --> 01:34:55,208
A man born,
you will pardon me, madame,

1592
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:56,791
on the wrong side
of the blanket

1593
01:34:57,084 --> 01:35:00,749
can nonetheless inherit
the features of his father:

1594
01:35:01,042 --> 01:35:04,833
his pride,
his patience,

1595
01:35:05,125 --> 01:35:06,624
and his vengeful spirit.

1596
01:35:06,917 --> 01:35:11,958
- It was my revenge,
my pride, my vengeful spirit.

1597
01:35:12,250 --> 01:35:14,958
And I did not inherit it
from Simeon Lee.

1598
01:35:15,250 --> 01:35:17,124
I got nothing
from Simeon Lee,

1599
01:35:17,417 --> 01:35:18,791
nothing.

1600
01:35:19,084 --> 01:35:21,458
- And you waited.

1601
01:35:21,750 --> 01:35:24,583
You and your son
followed Simeon Lee,

1602
01:35:24,875 --> 01:35:25,791
and you waited.

1603
01:35:26,084 --> 01:35:27,791
- 40 years.

1604
01:35:28,084 --> 01:35:30,458
- You instilled into your son
your own rage.

1605
01:35:30,750 --> 01:35:32,499
- I saved Simeon Lee's life.

1606
01:35:32,792 --> 01:35:34,958
And he used me,
and he stole from me,

1607
01:35:35,250 --> 01:35:37,124
and he deserted me
and my child.

1608
01:35:37,417 --> 01:35:40,458
- Your son changed his name,
settled down to a career,

1609
01:35:40,750 --> 01:35:42,999
and he also waited.

1610
01:35:43,292 --> 01:35:46,333
Nothing in this life was
so important to either of you

1611
01:35:46,625 --> 01:35:48,541
but the total destruction
of Simeon Lee.

1612
01:35:48,834 --> 01:35:51,833
- Simeon Lee earned his death
as he earned nothing else

1613
01:35:52,125 --> 01:35:53,249
in his whole life.

1614
01:35:53,542 --> 01:35:55,583
He was a...

1615
01:36:14,875 --> 01:36:16,458
- Come in, superintendent.

1616
01:36:28,125 --> 01:36:29,958
- What's going on?

1617
01:36:30,250 --> 01:36:32,666
- And now you can see it,
can you not, Chief Inspector?

1618
01:36:32,959 --> 01:36:36,624
You can see why Tressilian
felt so disoriented.

1619
01:36:36,917 --> 01:36:39,458
- What's all this about?

1620
01:36:39,750 --> 01:36:41,333
- The extent
of his disorientation

1621
01:36:41,625 --> 01:36:44,124
did not fully dawn upon me

1622
01:36:44,417 --> 01:36:47,791
until I purchased
from the village shop

1623
01:36:48,084 --> 01:36:51,124
the false moustache
and attached it

1624
01:36:51,417 --> 01:36:54,916
to the portrait of Simeon Lee
in the sitting room.

1625
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:08,333
The likeness...

1626
01:37:08,625 --> 01:37:11,291
it was extraordinary.

1627
01:37:11,584 --> 01:37:14,791
- You're saying
I look like Simeon Lee?

1628
01:37:21,667 --> 01:37:26,166
- You are like Simeon Lee
in almost every respect.

1629
01:37:27,375 --> 01:37:28,583
- None of that!

1630
01:37:31,584 --> 01:37:36,499
- You resemble very closely
your father!

1631
01:37:36,792 --> 01:37:39,791
And also,
like your father,

1632
01:37:40,084 --> 01:37:43,583
you are prepared to wait years,
if necessary, for your revenge.

1633
01:37:54,250 --> 01:37:57,249
And your revenge
is indeed terrible.

1634
01:38:06,209 --> 01:38:11,958
And so you embark
on your ingenious subterfuge...

1635
01:38:16,625 --> 01:38:20,333
Weaving the intricate web
of deception

1636
01:38:20,625 --> 01:38:23,291
that will make the murder
which you have committed

1637
01:38:23,584 --> 01:38:25,541
appear to have been perpetrated

1638
01:38:25,834 --> 01:38:28,958
by an innocent member
of the household,

1639
01:38:29,250 --> 01:38:32,541
while you yourself
were absent.

1640
01:38:35,084 --> 01:38:36,874
You make sure
that Tressilian notes well

1641
01:38:37,167 --> 01:38:39,041
your exit from the house.

1642
01:38:39,334 --> 01:38:41,791
- We'll be having more snow
tonight, I shouldn't wonder.

1643
01:38:43,542 --> 01:38:44,458
Good night.

1644
01:38:44,750 --> 01:38:46,458
- Good night, sir.

1645
01:38:52,917 --> 01:38:57,458
- You stop halfway
down the drive...

1646
01:38:57,750 --> 01:38:59,999
wait long enough to distance
yourself from the crime

1647
01:39:00,292 --> 01:39:02,708
in the minds of the family...

1648
01:39:04,750 --> 01:39:07,083
And then return to the house.

1649
01:39:16,209 --> 01:39:18,624
Once beneath the window,

1650
01:39:18,917 --> 01:39:21,874
you activate
the mechanism most crude

1651
01:39:22,167 --> 01:39:24,833
that creates the hideous sound
of a murder

1652
01:39:25,125 --> 01:39:27,166
that you had
already committed.

1653
01:39:34,209 --> 01:39:35,958
And then,
to further your alibi,

1654
01:39:36,250 --> 01:39:39,958
you find an excuse to actually
come back into the house.

1655
01:39:40,250 --> 01:39:42,249
- I've forgotten my book.

1656
01:39:46,250 --> 01:39:47,333
I want this room cleared.

1657
01:39:47,625 --> 01:39:50,333
- In this way,
you are fortuitously present

1658
01:39:50,625 --> 01:39:52,583
to investigate your own crime.

1659
01:39:52,875 --> 01:39:55,874
- These are mere ravings.

1660
01:39:58,542 --> 01:40:00,458
Unsubstantiated ravings.

1661
01:40:00,750 --> 01:40:03,083
- Non, non, non, non,
superintendent.

1662
01:40:03,375 --> 01:40:05,708
Also like your father,

1663
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:09,416
you are prepared to stop
at nothing to achieve your aim.

1664
01:40:13,125 --> 01:40:15,124
As the investigating officer,

1665
01:40:15,417 --> 01:40:17,749
you are perfectly placed
to put the diamonds

1666
01:40:18,042 --> 01:40:20,416
where you know
they will be found...

1667
01:40:24,417 --> 01:40:29,291
And to do the same
with the black leather case.

1668
01:40:29,584 --> 01:40:34,583
In this way, you sought
to incriminate the innocent...

1669
01:40:38,042 --> 01:40:40,124
And worse.

1670
01:40:40,417 --> 01:40:42,583
Mademoiselle López
had given to you already

1671
01:40:42,875 --> 01:40:44,291
one very nasty moment.

1672
01:40:44,584 --> 01:40:47,458
- I think that
when he was a young man,

1673
01:40:47,750 --> 01:40:51,041
he must have been
very handsome.

1674
01:40:51,334 --> 01:40:53,916
Like you.

1675
01:40:54,209 --> 01:40:56,249
- You knew,
which we did not know,

1676
01:40:56,542 --> 01:40:58,458
that she meant that literally.

1677
01:40:58,750 --> 01:41:01,333
- I think I'd better go
and find Sergeant Coombes.

1678
01:41:01,625 --> 01:41:03,458
- She saw the likeness.

1679
01:41:03,750 --> 01:41:05,374
And then...

1680
01:41:05,667 --> 01:41:08,124
she made the discovery
of the balloon.

1681
01:41:08,417 --> 01:41:11,124
- It is what I picked up
in Grandfather's room.

1682
01:41:11,417 --> 01:41:13,416
He must have had a balloon too.

1683
01:41:13,709 --> 01:41:16,458
- Suddenly, you were afraid.

1684
01:41:16,750 --> 01:41:19,541
You thought that she might put
the two and two together.

1685
01:41:19,834 --> 01:41:23,916
And from that moment,
the fate of Mademoiselle López,

1686
01:41:24,209 --> 01:41:25,749
it was sealed.

1687
01:41:31,459 --> 01:41:32,708
- It was indeed fortunate
for her

1688
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,999
that at your first clumsy blows,
she screamed,

1689
01:41:35,292 --> 01:41:39,958
and you were forced to leave
the task unfinished.

1690
01:41:40,250 --> 01:41:42,624
- Madre de Dios!

1691
01:41:42,917 --> 01:41:45,249
- Harold Sugden,

1692
01:41:45,542 --> 01:41:46,999
I am arresting you
on a charge

1693
01:41:47,292 --> 01:41:51,791
of the willful murder
of your father, Simeon Lee.

1694
01:41:52,084 --> 01:41:54,458
- May his soul rot in hell.

1695
01:42:07,584 --> 01:42:10,124
I'm sorry, Mother.

1696
01:42:12,125 --> 01:42:14,624
- We did well, Harold.

1697
01:42:20,625 --> 01:42:22,708
- Come on.
Let's get it over with.

1698
01:43:08,250 --> 01:43:10,041
- Who were you going
to telephone then?

1699
01:43:10,334 --> 01:43:11,499
- My dressmaker.

1700
01:43:11,792 --> 01:43:14,499
- At 8:00 on the night
before Christmas Eve?

1701
01:43:19,584 --> 01:43:23,291
- Why did old Simeon ask you
down here in the first place?

1702
01:43:23,584 --> 01:43:24,958
- Ah, because
Superintendent Sugden

1703
01:43:25,250 --> 01:43:27,083
wanted an expert witness
to the proceedings

1704
01:43:27,375 --> 01:43:28,958
to prove that he could not
have been involved.

1705
01:43:29,250 --> 01:43:31,458
So he asked Simeon Lee
to invite me.

1706
01:43:31,750 --> 01:43:33,708
- But Sugden said he didn't.

1707
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,874
- That is because
he did not want us to know

1708
01:43:36,167 --> 01:43:39,374
that he'd been in contact
with Simeon Lee before.

1709
01:43:46,417 --> 01:43:48,874
- Mr. Poirot,
Chief Inspector Japp,

1710
01:43:49,167 --> 01:43:51,458
must you go so soon?

1711
01:43:51,750 --> 01:43:54,791
- It is with regret, madame,
but we have to catch the train.

1712
01:43:55,084 --> 01:43:56,249
Monsieur Lee.

1713
01:43:56,542 --> 01:43:59,666
- Mr. Poirot, I wanted
to thank you so very much.

1714
01:43:59,959 --> 01:44:02,083
- Non, non, non,
pas de tout, madame.

1715
01:44:02,375 --> 01:44:04,624
It is a sad thing, non?

1716
01:44:04,917 --> 01:44:09,499
To meet like this
and at Christmas.

1717
01:44:09,792 --> 01:44:10,958
Au revoir, mon amie.

1718
01:44:23,584 --> 01:44:26,833
- Monsieur Poirot!

1719
01:44:27,125 --> 01:44:31,041
I wanted to say good-bye
and to thank you.

1720
01:44:31,334 --> 01:44:33,624
- Mademoiselle López.

1721
01:44:33,917 --> 01:44:35,333
And might I suggest that,
in the future,

1722
01:44:35,625 --> 01:44:37,416
you maintain your own identity?

1723
01:44:37,709 --> 01:44:43,083
It will cause, I am sure,
much less of the complications.

1724
01:44:43,375 --> 01:44:45,166
- Harry and I are going
to Paris.

1725
01:44:45,459 --> 01:44:48,916
- She knows she'll be safe
with an old man like me.

1726
01:44:49,209 --> 01:44:50,999
- I'm sure she will,
Monsieur Harry.

1727
01:44:51,292 --> 01:44:53,083
- Good-bye.

1728
01:44:55,625 --> 01:44:57,624
- Oh, yes?

1729
01:45:24,375 --> 01:45:25,833
- Merry Christmas,
Chief Inspector.

1730
01:45:26,125 --> 01:45:29,124
- Oh, Poirot,
you shouldn't have.

1731
01:45:29,417 --> 01:45:31,208
- I have not yet thanked you
for my present.

1732
01:45:31,500 --> 01:45:32,874
- I hope you like them.

1733
01:45:33,167 --> 01:45:35,041
- Oh, I do
very, very much indeed.

1734
01:45:35,334 --> 01:45:37,791
Such wonderful colors
and such workmanship.

1735
01:45:38,084 --> 01:45:38,958
- Emily's been knitting away

1736
01:45:39,250 --> 01:45:41,624
at those blessed gloves
for months.

1737
01:45:41,917 --> 01:45:46,249
- Ah, well, you must tell to her
how much I thank her

1738
01:45:46,542 --> 01:45:49,124
and how much her skill
it is appreciated.

1739
01:45:49,417 --> 01:45:52,249
- I will.
I will.

1740
01:45:55,084 --> 01:45:57,291
You're not going
to wear them now, then?

1741
01:45:57,584 --> 01:46:00,958
- Non, non, non, non, non,
non, mon ami.

1742
01:46:01,250 --> 01:46:04,041
These must be kept
for best, huh?

1743
01:46:04,334 --> 01:46:07,666
I shall wear them only
when I go to church.
