1
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:25,416
- Narrator cue in five seconds,
Mr. Hotsworth.

2
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:31,583
- The jury is out.

3
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:33,249
And all London holds its breath

4
00:01:33,542 --> 00:01:36,999
for the verdict
in the infamous Beroldy trial.

5
00:01:37,292 --> 00:01:39,958
Accusations against
the beautiful Madame Beroldy

6
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,291
over the brutal murder
of her husband, Arnold,

7
00:01:42,584 --> 00:01:46,041
have shocked the entire nation.

8
00:01:46,334 --> 00:01:48,249
After their wedding
ten years ago,

9
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:49,458
Monsieur and Madame Beroldy

10
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,249
took a prominent place
in London society,

11
00:01:52,542 --> 00:01:54,583
with the couple
setting up permanent home here

12
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:56,041
12 months ago.

13
00:01:56,334 --> 00:01:58,999
And it was good news
for the capital too,

14
00:01:59,292 --> 00:02:01,666
as Mr. Beroldy
established his headquarters

15
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:04,749
in the port of London.

16
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:06,374
Together with
his English partner

17
00:02:06,667 --> 00:02:07,541
Mr. George Connor,

18
00:02:07,834 --> 00:02:09,458
seen here with Monsieur Beroldy,

19
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,708
they brought valuable income
to Britain.

20
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:18,333
Then tragedy.

21
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:20,999
Masked intruders
break into the Beroldy home.

22
00:02:21,292 --> 00:02:23,208
Jean Beroldy is found tied up.

23
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,708
Her husband is stabbed
in the heart.

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,624
And at the memorial service
afterwards,

25
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:32,916
Mr. Connor comforts
the grieving widow.

26
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:35,166
Two months later,
a sensation,

27
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:37,624
as Jean Beroldy
is taken into custody

28
00:02:37,917 --> 00:02:40,166
and charged
with her husband's murder.

29
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:42,666
The story of the intruders
was, they say,

30
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,291
a clever concoction
to divert suspicion.

31
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:48,666
Evidence comes to light
of a secret assignation

32
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,458
between Madame Beroldy
and Monsieur Beroldy's partner,

33
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,083
George Connor.

34
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:55,166
But before the police
can apprehend him,

35
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:58,624
George Connor
flees the country.

36
00:03:00,542 --> 00:03:04,124
And so, as Jean Beroldy
faces the future alone,

37
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:06,416
her nine-year-old daughter,
Marthe,

38
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:09,541
fights to hold back the tears.

39
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:13,541
- All right, hold it.

40
00:03:13,834 --> 00:03:15,583
- 85 seconds, Mr. Letts.

41
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,333
- Um, and I think
we should come back

42
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:19,166
to the Beroldy woman
at the end.

43
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:23,208
- That's all the footage
we've got, Mr. Letts.

44
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,499
- Uh, okay.

45
00:03:24,792 --> 00:03:26,916
Uh, then let's see
those last shots again.

46
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:31,333
- Ah, good story.

47
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:32,833
George Connor
commits the crime,

48
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:34,749
then runs off
and abandons Jean Beroldy.

49
00:03:35,042 --> 00:03:36,166
- Well, no,
from what I've heard,

50
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:37,624
they were in it together.

51
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:38,958
He may have held the knife,

52
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,749
but it was Madame Beroldy
who guided his hand.

53
00:03:42,042 --> 00:03:44,166
- When's the verdict?
- Tomorrow.

54
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,249
- Well, maybe you can get
some more footage later.

55
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:47,791
I doubt it.

56
00:03:48,084 --> 00:03:49,999
If Madame Beroldy really did
kill her husband,

57
00:03:50,292 --> 00:03:52,708
she won't be making
any more appearances.

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,541
- Ready, Mr. Letts.

59
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:56,333
- Run it.

60
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:06,249
Poor little girl.

61
00:04:06,542 --> 00:04:08,708
Her mummy's going to hang.

62
00:05:00,792 --> 00:05:01,916
- Ah, Hastings.

63
00:05:02,209 --> 00:05:05,624
To come again to France,
c'est magnifique.

64
00:05:05,917 --> 00:05:07,749
It will be
the experience gastronomique.

65
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:10,208
- I'm sure Deauville
will be perfect for you, Poirot.

66
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,291
- So you said, mon ami,

67
00:05:11,584 --> 00:05:12,916
when you chose for us
our destination.

68
00:05:13,209 --> 00:05:14,958
- Well, it's famous
for its comfortable hotels,

69
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,333
excellent food,
sophisticated crowd.

70
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,249
- Yes, but it seems to me,
Hastings,

71
00:05:19,542 --> 00:05:20,999
that these sophisticated people,

72
00:05:21,292 --> 00:05:24,208
they interest themselves mainly
in les activites sportif.

73
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,458
- Yes, well, some people
come to Deauville for that,

74
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,958
but, uh, not everyone.

75
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,249
- No, for me, Hastings,

76
00:05:31,542 --> 00:05:34,624
I interest myself
in le bonne cuisine maman.

77
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:37,041
- Absolutely.

78
00:05:40,584 --> 00:05:42,874
- Hastings, this hotel
that you have reserved for us,

79
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:44,916
it has a chef
of the first order?

80
00:05:45,209 --> 00:05:47,458
- Oh, top-notch, Poirot.
- Bon.

81
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,124
And the name of this hotel,
Hastings,

82
00:05:49,417 --> 00:05:51,499
you neglected, I think,
to mention it to me.

83
00:06:00,667 --> 00:06:03,333
- Pure coincidence, Poirot.

84
00:06:11,834 --> 00:06:14,541
A lot of golfers are very
gastronomic, you know, Poirot.

85
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:16,708
Nothing like 18 holes
to build up an appetite.

86
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,374
You really ought to try it,
you know.

87
00:06:18,667 --> 00:06:19,999
You might find
you actually enjoy it.

88
00:06:20,292 --> 00:06:21,874
- To hit a little ball
into the little hole

89
00:06:22,167 --> 00:06:23,541
in the middle
of a large open field--

90
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:26,958
no, but I think it is not
to the taste of Poirot.

91
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,458
No.

92
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,083
- Oh, thank you.
- À votre service, monsieur.

93
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:45,583
- You have the options
on the land

94
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,499
adjoining the golf course,

95
00:06:47,792 --> 00:06:49,374
but when the architect

96
00:06:49,667 --> 00:06:51,416
asked me if he could see you
tomorrow afternoon,

97
00:06:51,709 --> 00:06:52,916
he wants to know
what you think--

98
00:06:53,209 --> 00:06:56,458
- Wait a minute.
That man.

99
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,458
- What, the little one
with the moustache?

100
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,416
- That's Hercule Poirot.

101
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:02,041
- The detective?

102
00:07:03,792 --> 00:07:06,208
- Staying here.

103
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,374
Where's Laurence?
Damn him.

104
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:13,291
- He's just coming now.

105
00:07:29,292 --> 00:07:30,624
You don't need
a private detective,

106
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:31,833
do you, Paul?

107
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,791
- No.

108
00:07:35,084 --> 00:07:38,041
Why do you ask?

109
00:07:38,334 --> 00:07:42,249
- Well, you've been very...
preoccupied recently.

110
00:07:42,542 --> 00:07:43,416
I just thought--

111
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:45,041
- I don't need
a private detective.

112
00:07:45,334 --> 00:07:47,541
And it's none
of your damn business anyway.

113
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:49,374
You're my secretary, Stonor,

114
00:07:49,667 --> 00:07:51,666
not my confidante.

115
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,416
- I'm sorry.

116
00:07:53,709 --> 00:07:55,416
- It doesn't matter.

117
00:08:03,292 --> 00:08:06,249
Laurence, you're taking my son
to the station this afternoon.

118
00:08:06,542 --> 00:08:07,708
- Oui, monsieur.

119
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,999
- Then you've got your holiday;
is that right?

120
00:08:10,292 --> 00:08:12,458
- Oui, monsieur.

121
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,083
- Good.

122
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,166
- Salut, Jack.

123
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,541
- That was my stepfather.
I have to go now.

124
00:08:32,834 --> 00:08:34,416
- Jack, darling...

125
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:35,666
- I have to pack.

126
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:36,916
The ship leaves tonight.

127
00:08:37,209 --> 00:08:38,208
- It's so far away.

128
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,541
Santiago's the other side
of the world.

129
00:08:40,834 --> 00:08:41,958
I can't bear it.

130
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,249
- I have no choice.

131
00:08:44,542 --> 00:08:45,749
A whole year training

132
00:08:46,042 --> 00:08:47,874
for the most important
cycling event of the region,

133
00:08:48,167 --> 00:08:49,374
and then a week
before they're off,

134
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:52,208
he springs this on me.

135
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,666
- Why not refuse?

136
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:55,166
You don't even like him.

137
00:08:55,459 --> 00:08:58,041
Why don't you just tell him...
no?

138
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,666
- It's only three months.

139
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:04,999
I'll be back.

140
00:09:05,292 --> 00:09:06,708
- Now I know what she felt like.

141
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,291
- Who?

142
00:09:08,584 --> 00:09:09,541
- You know who.

143
00:09:09,834 --> 00:09:10,624
Isabelle.

144
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:11,916
She lost you to me,

145
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:13,833
and now I'm losing you
to your stupid business.

146
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:15,916
- It's not the same.

147
00:09:17,167 --> 00:09:19,083
I love you, Marthe.

148
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,249
- You loved her.

149
00:09:20,542 --> 00:09:22,666
- Until I met you.

150
00:09:32,334 --> 00:09:34,041
- Marthe.

151
00:09:34,334 --> 00:09:35,499
- Mother.

152
00:09:38,167 --> 00:09:40,208
- I understand
you're leaving us, Jack.

153
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,666
- Yes, Madame Daubreuil, I...

154
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:44,999
I have to go now.

155
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:46,166
- I shall miss you.

156
00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:48,083
We both will.

157
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:49,833
- Write to me.

158
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,666
- Every day.

159
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,541
- Are your cases ready, Jack?

160
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:27,958
- Yes, Mother.

161
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,249
They're in the hall.

162
00:10:30,542 --> 00:10:33,958
- I told Laurence
to put them in the car.

163
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,208
- I wish you'd tell me
what this trip is all about.

164
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,249
Ten days crossing
to Buenos Aires

165
00:10:39,542 --> 00:10:41,958
and then overland
to Santiago.

166
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,249
Seems like a hell of a long way
to go just on your say-so.

167
00:10:45,542 --> 00:10:47,583
- You don't want to be part
of my business?

168
00:10:49,667 --> 00:10:51,041
- I think you're getting me
out of the way,

169
00:10:51,334 --> 00:10:52,666
because you don't want me
to see Marthe.

170
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,833
- That's a ridiculous
suggestion.

171
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:56,708
- Then why all the secrecy?

172
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,499
- You'll be met at Santiago.

173
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:01,749
Everything will be explained
to you.

174
00:11:02,042 --> 00:11:03,624
- Thank you, Leonie.
That'll be all.

175
00:11:03,917 --> 00:11:05,916
- Yes, Madame Renauld.

176
00:11:06,209 --> 00:11:07,999
- You know,
separating Marthe and me

177
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,458
will not change
my feelings towards her.

178
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,833
- That's enough.

179
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,083
- You are only my stepfather.

180
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:15,333
You cannot rule my life.

181
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:18,333
- Jack.
- No.

182
00:11:19,709 --> 00:11:22,041
I wish you were dead sometimes.

183
00:11:22,334 --> 00:11:23,499
At least once in my life,

184
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:25,499
I could do as I pleased.

185
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,333
- Was dinner all right, Poirot?

186
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,499
- Yes, thank you, Hastings.

187
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,999
It is indeed fortunate for you
that this is a hotel

188
00:12:51,292 --> 00:12:55,499
of great comfort
and a cuisine most excellent.

189
00:12:55,792 --> 00:12:57,666
- Thank goodness for that.

190
00:12:57,959 --> 00:12:59,374
It's a marvelous golf course.

191
00:12:59,667 --> 00:13:02,249
They say it'll be the best in
France when they've finished it.

192
00:13:02,542 --> 00:13:03,749
- Oh, so this golf course,

193
00:13:04,042 --> 00:13:05,791
it does not have
the necessary number of holes?

194
00:13:06,084 --> 00:13:08,624
- Oh, no, it's got 18 holes,
but they're extending it,

195
00:13:08,917 --> 00:13:10,499
adding a few more bunkers,
that sort of thing.

196
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:12,624
- These things,
what is it, a bunker?

197
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,249
- Oh, you know, a sand trap.

198
00:13:15,542 --> 00:13:17,124
I'm afraid that's where
I usually end up.

199
00:13:17,417 --> 00:13:20,874
- Ah, it is the same in French,
le bunker.

200
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:22,291
- Oh.

201
00:13:22,584 --> 00:13:23,874
- And tomorrow, you play,

202
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:26,291
how do you say,
the circle?

203
00:13:26,584 --> 00:13:27,916
- Oh, around.
Yes, yes.

204
00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:29,749
They're lining me up
with some people.

205
00:13:31,792 --> 00:13:33,541
- Mesdames et messieurs,

206
00:13:33,834 --> 00:13:35,208
ladies and gentlemen,

207
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,916
je vous présent
Isabelle Duveen.

208
00:13:45,584 --> 00:13:48,666
- What an absolutely
lovely girl.

209
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,833
- Mr. Poirot?

210
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:12,374
My name is Paul Renauld.

211
00:14:12,667 --> 00:14:14,583
May I join you?

212
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:16,874
- S'il vous plaît,
Monsieur Renauld.

213
00:14:20,417 --> 00:14:22,833
- Mr. Poirot, I happened
to see you this morning.

214
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,041
- Shh, shh, shh.

215
00:14:24,334 --> 00:14:26,291
- It was a piece
of remarkable fortune,

216
00:14:26,584 --> 00:14:28,749
because...
Mr. Poirot,

217
00:14:29,042 --> 00:14:32,208
I will pay you anything
to help me.

218
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,208
- In what way, monsieur?

219
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,083
- I believe I am in danger
of my life.

220
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:40,041
- What makes you think that?

221
00:14:40,334 --> 00:14:41,916
- I'm a rich man, Mr. Poirot.

222
00:14:42,209 --> 00:14:43,249
I have enemies.

223
00:14:43,542 --> 00:14:46,666
- May I ask what work is it
that you do?

224
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,999
- I own properties, hotels.

225
00:14:50,292 --> 00:14:52,041
This hotel
and the golf course are mine.

226
00:14:52,334 --> 00:14:53,958
- Ah.

227
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:58,624
- But I have another business
in precious stones.

228
00:14:58,917 --> 00:15:04,041
I export them
out of Santiago in Chile.

229
00:15:04,334 --> 00:15:07,083
And that's where
the trouble began.

230
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,583
Fraud, Mr. Poirot,

231
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,416
on a massive scale.

232
00:15:13,667 --> 00:15:14,874
I can't talk to you here.

233
00:15:15,167 --> 00:15:16,666
It's too dangerous.

234
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,833
Will you come
to my villa tomorrow?

235
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:21,333
It's the Villa Genevieve
just past the Villa Marguerite

236
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,958
on the other side of the links.

237
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,583
- Oui, d'accord.

238
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,874
- Thank you, Mr. Poirot.

239
00:15:28,167 --> 00:15:30,124
Thank you.

240
00:15:30,417 --> 00:15:31,833
- De rien,
Monsieur Renauld.

241
00:15:39,917 --> 00:15:42,916
- It is most strange,
is it not, Hastings?

242
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:46,749
This Monsieur Renauld,
he says to me so much.

243
00:15:47,042 --> 00:15:48,999
And yet he tells to me nothing.

244
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:52,708
- Hastings?

245
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,916
- Be brave.

246
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,416
- Help me, Leonie.

247
00:20:30,709 --> 00:20:31,583
Help me.

248
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,499
Help me!

249
00:20:33,792 --> 00:20:35,083
- Madame!

250
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:36,374
- Toss for honors?

251
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:37,708
- Heads.

252
00:20:41,834 --> 00:20:44,416
- Tails, I think.

253
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,208
- Yes, monsieur.

254
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,624
- Bonjour, monsieur.

255
00:21:05,917 --> 00:21:09,124
I have an appointment
with Monsieur Paul Renauld.

256
00:21:09,417 --> 00:21:11,666
My name is--
- I-I know who you are.

257
00:21:11,959 --> 00:21:13,291
You better come in.

258
00:21:13,584 --> 00:21:15,291
- Merci.

259
00:21:17,334 --> 00:21:19,333
- My name is Lucian Bex.

260
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,333
I'm commissary of the police
here in Deauville.

261
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:23,374
- Monsieur Bex.

262
00:21:25,459 --> 00:21:28,583
Something has occurred
to Monsieur Renauld?

263
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,624
- What's going on, Bex?

264
00:21:35,084 --> 00:21:38,583
What is, uh, your business
with Monsieur Renauld?

265
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:41,708
- That is a matter confidential,
monsieur.

266
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,374
Monsieur Renauld--
- He's not here.

267
00:21:44,667 --> 00:21:47,874
I'm Giraud of The Sûreté.

268
00:21:48,167 --> 00:21:49,374
- Giraud.

269
00:21:49,667 --> 00:21:51,374
That is a name
that is known to me.

270
00:21:51,667 --> 00:21:54,291
- It is a name known to many.

271
00:21:54,584 --> 00:21:55,708
And you, monsieur?

272
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,041
- Monsieur Giraud,
this is Hercule Poirot.

273
00:21:58,334 --> 00:21:59,749
It's remarkable--

274
00:22:00,042 --> 00:22:01,916
- Wait a minute,
Commissar Bex.

275
00:22:02,209 --> 00:22:03,874
Renauld asked you
to come here today?

276
00:22:04,167 --> 00:22:05,624
- Oui.

277
00:22:05,917 --> 00:22:07,583
- Why?

278
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:10,416
- He told me that he considered
his life to be in danger.

279
00:22:10,709 --> 00:22:13,166
- Well, it looks like
he went to the wrong man.

280
00:22:13,459 --> 00:22:16,458
Monsieur Renauld
was abducted last night.

281
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,291
- Are you at the Golf Hotel?

282
00:22:23,584 --> 00:22:25,458
- Yes, I'm there every year.

283
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,624
- I don't suppose
you were in the bar last night?

284
00:22:27,917 --> 00:22:31,708
There was a singer,
lovely voice.

285
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,291
- Do you mind?
- Sorry.

286
00:22:34,584 --> 00:22:35,624
Lovely.

287
00:22:41,709 --> 00:22:44,208
- I don't know what woke me up.

288
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,083
But when I opened my eyes,
there were two men in the room,

289
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:48,583
both wearing masks.

290
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:50,791
- So you cannot describe them
at all, madame?

291
00:22:51,084 --> 00:22:52,416
- It was too dark.

292
00:22:52,709 --> 00:22:54,416
Obviously.

293
00:22:54,709 --> 00:22:55,958
It was the middle of the night.

294
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,749
- It was 2:00.

295
00:22:58,042 --> 00:23:00,333
I heard the clock strike
on the mantelpiece.

296
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:01,708
- Fortunate.

297
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,083
- Yes, indeed.

298
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:07,291
- Go on.

299
00:23:07,584 --> 00:23:11,958
- One of them forced a gag
into my mouth and tied me up.

300
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,541
The other one
was standing over Paul.

301
00:23:14,834 --> 00:23:18,249
He'd taken a knife
from my dressing table here.

302
00:23:18,542 --> 00:23:22,124
It was a gift
from my son, Jack.

303
00:23:22,417 --> 00:23:24,874
Anyway, he was
threatening Paul with it.

304
00:23:25,167 --> 00:23:26,291
- Did he speak?

305
00:23:26,584 --> 00:23:29,416
- Yes, in South American
Spanish.

306
00:23:29,709 --> 00:23:31,833
He was from Chile.
I'm sure of it.

307
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:33,416
That's where Paul and I met.

308
00:23:33,709 --> 00:23:36,083
We lived there for many years.

309
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:37,916
- And what did he say?

310
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:40,583
- Sabe lo que queremos.

311
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:42,749
"You know what we want."

312
00:23:43,042 --> 00:23:44,958
Those were his first words.

313
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,791
The other one:
"The papers, where are they?"

314
00:23:48,084 --> 00:23:50,458
- Ah, yes, Monsieur Renauld,
he spoke to me of a fraud.

315
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,624
- What happened then?

316
00:23:52,917 --> 00:23:55,833
- Well, I-I don't remember
anything else.

317
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:59,291
I-I think I must have fainted.

318
00:23:59,584 --> 00:24:00,791
Oh, God, I...

319
00:24:01,084 --> 00:24:03,083
- Oh, no, no, no, no, madame.

320
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,333
Console yourself.

321
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:07,958
Poirot will find him.

322
00:24:11,667 --> 00:24:13,291
You permit, madame?

323
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:21,874
Oh, la...

324
00:24:22,167 --> 00:24:24,166
they must have
caused you great pain.

325
00:24:38,834 --> 00:24:40,916
- I don't think my partner's
got his mind on the game.

326
00:24:41,209 --> 00:24:43,749
I'll be digging one of those
new bunkers through there.

327
00:24:44,042 --> 00:24:45,999
- Come on.
I'll help you find the ball.

328
00:24:46,292 --> 00:24:48,333
- Oh, thanks.

329
00:24:49,959 --> 00:24:51,166
- It's my fault, sir.

330
00:24:51,459 --> 00:24:54,208
Every night, I lock the doors,
but last night, I was so tired.

331
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,916
- You failed in your duty.

332
00:24:57,209 --> 00:24:58,833
- Tell me, Mademoiselle Leonie,

333
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:01,499
at what hour
did you retire to bed?

334
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:04,416
- At 9:00.
- Uh-huh.

335
00:25:04,709 --> 00:25:05,999
And you heard nothing?

336
00:25:06,292 --> 00:25:08,374
- No, sir.
I didn't hear a sound.

337
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:14,833
- And this?
- That's mine, sir.

338
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:17,833
I always have cocoa
in the evening.

339
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:20,749
- Tell me--
- Do you mind, Monsieur Poirot?

340
00:25:21,042 --> 00:25:23,333
This is my investigation.

341
00:25:26,417 --> 00:25:28,583
- There were just the three
of you in the house last night?

342
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:31,083
- Yes, sir.
- Isn't there a son?

343
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:34,666
- Master Jack is
Monsieur Renauld's stepson, sir.

344
00:25:34,959 --> 00:25:36,916
He left yesterday
for South America.

345
00:25:37,209 --> 00:25:38,333
- Ah, to Chile?

346
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:40,583
- Yes, sir, to Santiago.

347
00:25:40,875 --> 00:25:42,249
- Do you know why?

348
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:43,791
- No, sir.

349
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,916
I believe it's to do
with his father's business.

350
00:25:46,209 --> 00:25:47,166
He didn't want to go.

351
00:25:47,459 --> 00:25:48,666
- No?

352
00:25:48,959 --> 00:25:50,041
- No, sir.

353
00:25:50,334 --> 00:25:51,208
As a matter of fact,

354
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,791
they argued about it
quite violently.

355
00:25:54,084 --> 00:25:56,499
And Jack was very upset to miss
the Trophée De Deauville.

356
00:25:56,792 --> 00:25:58,291
- Hmm?
- The cycle race.

357
00:25:58,584 --> 00:26:00,291
- Ah.
- He'd been training very hard.

358
00:26:00,584 --> 00:26:01,374
- Tell me, mademoiselle,

359
00:26:01,667 --> 00:26:02,958
did Monsieur Renauld
and his stepson

360
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,083
argue together very often?

361
00:26:04,375 --> 00:26:06,541
- Yes, sir, I'm afraid they did.

362
00:26:06,834 --> 00:26:08,416
- Oh, for heaven's sake, Poirot.

363
00:26:08,709 --> 00:26:11,124
Do you think Jack Renauld
kidnapped his stepfather?

364
00:26:11,417 --> 00:26:14,124
- I think the thoughts
of Hercule Poirot, monsieur,

365
00:26:14,417 --> 00:26:17,708
are far beyond
your comprehension.

366
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:21,666
- Was there anyone else
in the house?

367
00:26:21,959 --> 00:26:23,541
No gardener or handyman?

368
00:26:23,834 --> 00:26:25,833
- Laurence, the chauffeur,
should have been here, sir,

369
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:27,166
but he's on holiday.

370
00:26:27,459 --> 00:26:28,291
- When did he leave?

371
00:26:28,584 --> 00:26:29,458
- Yesterday, sir.

372
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,833
- He also?

373
00:26:32,125 --> 00:26:33,791
C'est curieux.

374
00:26:46,834 --> 00:26:48,458
- No sign of it?

375
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,999
- No.

376
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:06,249
- Thank you.
Ah, Monsieur Giraud.

377
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:09,499
I've circulated Paul Renauld's
description across France,

378
00:27:09,792 --> 00:27:12,833
and I have men making inquiries
at the station and the airport.

379
00:27:13,125 --> 00:27:14,791
- We'll find him.

380
00:27:15,084 --> 00:27:19,458
- Of that, I am not so sure,
monsieur.

381
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:22,624
- So...what's going on?

382
00:27:22,917 --> 00:27:25,374
- Who are you?

383
00:27:25,667 --> 00:27:27,083
- My name is Gabriel Stonor.

384
00:27:27,375 --> 00:27:29,166
I'm Mr. Renauld's
private secretary.

385
00:27:29,459 --> 00:27:30,416
Is there something wrong?

386
00:27:30,709 --> 00:27:32,249
- Monsieur Renauld
has disappeared,

387
00:27:32,542 --> 00:27:34,333
abducted by agents from Chile.

388
00:27:34,625 --> 00:27:38,333
- But that's...

389
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:39,958
My God,
I thought something was up.

390
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:42,333
- What do you mean?

391
00:27:42,625 --> 00:27:48,333
- Well, he's been very,
I don't know, nervous recently.

392
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,208
- How recently, Monsieur Stonor?

393
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,416
- In the past couple of weeks.

394
00:27:52,709 --> 00:27:54,583
He only came to France
a couple of years ago, you know.

395
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:56,291
- And before that?

396
00:27:56,584 --> 00:27:58,583
- He had a business
in precious stones in Chile.

397
00:27:58,875 --> 00:28:00,416
That's where he made
his fortune.

398
00:28:00,709 --> 00:28:02,374
But he's a very private man.

399
00:28:02,667 --> 00:28:03,791
I don't know much more
than that.

400
00:28:04,084 --> 00:28:05,041
- I see.

401
00:28:05,334 --> 00:28:07,124
- Where's Eloise?
Madame Renauld?

402
00:28:07,417 --> 00:28:09,624
- Upstairs.

403
00:28:09,917 --> 00:28:11,333
- I must go to her.

404
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:13,291
- Yes, of course.

405
00:28:17,709 --> 00:28:18,999
- You can go now,
Monsieur Poirot.

406
00:28:19,292 --> 00:28:20,624
- Monsieur Giraud.

407
00:28:20,917 --> 00:28:22,833
- Did you really think
you could just walk in here

408
00:28:23,125 --> 00:28:24,666
and take over
this investigation?

409
00:28:24,959 --> 00:28:26,999
This is my case.

410
00:28:27,292 --> 00:28:30,833
And if anyone is going to find
Monsieur Paul Renauld,

411
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:34,749
I can assure you
it's going to be me.

412
00:28:44,417 --> 00:28:46,749
- Still no luck?

413
00:28:47,042 --> 00:28:48,333
- No.

414
00:28:50,625 --> 00:28:52,458
I'll look over here.

415
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:05,166
- Find anything?

416
00:29:05,459 --> 00:29:06,624
- Good Lord.

417
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,874
Well, Dr. Hautet?

418
00:29:33,167 --> 00:29:35,083
- Killed at about 2:00
in the morning, I'd say.

419
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:37,374
Stabbed in the back.

420
00:29:37,667 --> 00:29:38,999
Unusual weapon.

421
00:29:39,292 --> 00:29:40,833
It's just a paper knife.

422
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:44,666
I'd say the stone in the hilt
was a sapphire.

423
00:29:44,959 --> 00:29:46,999
- Renauld's wife said they took
a knife from her room,

424
00:29:47,292 --> 00:29:48,333
a present from her son.

425
00:29:48,625 --> 00:29:50,666
- Has anyone informed
Madame Renauld?

426
00:29:50,959 --> 00:29:52,208
- No, Hastings.

427
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,708
And it is a duty
I would not wish to perform.

428
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,874
- There's a set of footprints
in there.

429
00:29:57,167 --> 00:29:58,291
You didn’t jump in, did you?

430
00:29:58,584 --> 00:30:00,541
- Of course not.
- It looks as if someone did.

431
00:30:00,834 --> 00:30:03,124
You can take him away now.

432
00:30:03,417 --> 00:30:05,458
Poor devil, marched out here

433
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,458
in nothing but that coat
and his underclothes

434
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,708
and then killed.

435
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,624
It's no way to go.

436
00:30:13,917 --> 00:30:16,333
- This is yours, I believe,
Captain Hastings.

437
00:30:16,625 --> 00:30:18,624
- Oh, thank you.

438
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:21,916
- Hastings, what is it,
this white line that I see?

439
00:30:22,209 --> 00:30:24,291
- Oh, they were going to dig
a new bunker here, Poirot.

440
00:30:24,584 --> 00:30:25,583
This is where
it was going to be.

441
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:27,916
- Ah.

442
00:30:28,209 --> 00:30:29,499
- This was by the grave.

443
00:30:29,792 --> 00:30:31,916
Brand-new.

444
00:30:32,209 --> 00:30:33,749
- What does it tell you,
Monsieur Giraud?

445
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:36,041
- Only that our friends
from Chile came prepared.

446
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,999
- Oh, so you assume
it was theirs?

447
00:30:39,292 --> 00:30:40,916
- Of course.

448
00:30:49,125 --> 00:30:50,291
- And what of this?

449
00:30:50,584 --> 00:30:53,749
- It's a piece of lead pipe.

450
00:30:54,042 --> 00:30:55,208
- Oui.

451
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,499
- Well, what of it?

452
00:30:56,792 --> 00:30:58,499
- It also was beside the grave.

453
00:30:58,792 --> 00:31:02,416
- Paul Renauld was stabbed,
not bludgeoned, you know.

454
00:31:02,709 --> 00:31:04,166
That's probably been here
for weeks.

455
00:31:04,459 --> 00:31:06,291
It's of no interest.
- Au contraire, monsieur.

456
00:31:06,584 --> 00:31:09,124
To Poirot,
it is of great interest.

457
00:31:11,625 --> 00:31:13,208
Label the spade
and put it with the knife.

458
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,916
- Bien sur, le commissar.

459
00:31:15,209 --> 00:31:17,624
- You can keep the lead pipe.

460
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:18,958
- Sir.

461
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:21,041
I found this
in the dead man's pocket, sir.

462
00:31:21,334 --> 00:31:24,749
- Merci.

463
00:31:25,042 --> 00:31:27,833
Hastings, if you please
to read it.

464
00:31:28,125 --> 00:31:29,374
- "My dearest one,

465
00:31:29,667 --> 00:31:31,916
"why haven't you written to me
for so long?

466
00:31:32,209 --> 00:31:34,249
"I am beginning to think
there's someone else.

467
00:31:34,542 --> 00:31:35,624
"I think I would kill you

468
00:31:35,917 --> 00:31:37,499
"if I thought
I was going to lose you.

469
00:31:37,792 --> 00:31:39,333
"But you do love me.

470
00:31:39,625 --> 00:31:41,666
"I know you do,
as I love you.

471
00:31:41,959 --> 00:31:45,124
Always,
your own adoring B.D."

472
00:31:45,417 --> 00:31:48,583
- So Paul Renauld had a lover.

473
00:31:48,875 --> 00:31:50,916
- That's what it looks like.

474
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:52,999
B.D.

475
00:31:53,292 --> 00:31:55,916
- I'm sure Madame Renauld
will enlighten us.

476
00:31:56,209 --> 00:31:57,916
- Well, you're not going to
ask her, are you?

477
00:31:58,209 --> 00:32:00,749
She doesn't even know
her husband's been...

478
00:32:01,042 --> 00:32:02,958
- Captain Hastings is right.

479
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:04,499
We better tell her.

480
00:32:04,792 --> 00:32:07,333
- I will tell her.

481
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:09,999
- That is most strange,
is it not, Hastings?

482
00:32:10,292 --> 00:32:11,583
- What's that, Poirot?

483
00:32:11,875 --> 00:32:14,916
- Monsieur Renauld.

484
00:32:15,209 --> 00:32:17,374
He wore his coat very long.

485
00:32:27,625 --> 00:32:30,916
This Giraud, I have heard
much about him, Hastings.

486
00:32:31,209 --> 00:32:32,124
- Who is he?

487
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:33,583
- They call him "The Pipe,"

488
00:32:33,875 --> 00:32:35,916
because smokes
this pipe ridiculous.

489
00:32:36,209 --> 00:32:37,624
- Well, he doesn't seem
very fond of you.

490
00:32:37,917 --> 00:32:39,541
- No, that is because
he believes himself to be

491
00:32:39,834 --> 00:32:41,291
the greatest detective
in France.

492
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:43,083
- Perhaps he is.
- No, no, no, Hastings.

493
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:45,874
Poirot, he is now in France.

494
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,416
Hastings, regarde.

495
00:32:52,709 --> 00:32:53,958
- Oh, let me.

496
00:32:57,959 --> 00:32:58,916
Ow!

497
00:32:59,209 --> 00:33:00,583
- Hastings, the briar,
it is sharp, huh?

498
00:33:00,875 --> 00:33:02,083
- Mm.

499
00:33:06,292 --> 00:33:08,333
- Viens, mon ami.

500
00:33:08,625 --> 00:33:11,958
- So much for my golf.

501
00:33:17,167 --> 00:33:21,208
- "Your own adoring B.D."

502
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,458
I don't know.

503
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:28,791
Unless...

504
00:33:29,084 --> 00:33:30,333
- Monsieur Stonor?

505
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:33,083
- The villa next door,
the Villa Marguerite,

506
00:33:33,375 --> 00:33:36,458
it's rented by
a Madame Daubreuil.

507
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:37,958
Bernadette Daubreuil.

508
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,166
- Do you know this woman?

509
00:33:39,459 --> 00:33:41,249
- No, but it's
the damndest thing.

510
00:33:41,542 --> 00:33:43,166
In the last three months,
Monsieur Renauld

511
00:33:43,459 --> 00:33:45,416
made three large payments
from his bank account.

512
00:33:45,709 --> 00:33:47,124
- To this Daubreuil woman?
- Yes.

513
00:33:47,417 --> 00:33:50,458
They added up to 100,000 francs.

514
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,999
I did ask Renauld about them,
but he just snapped at me.

515
00:33:53,292 --> 00:33:55,083
- You suspected blackmail,
Monsieur Stonor?

516
00:33:55,375 --> 00:33:58,708
- Yes, I did, but...

517
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,208
if she sent him this letter,

518
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,583
maybe they were having
an affair.

519
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:03,916
Seems self-evident.

520
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:07,124
- It was so unlike him.

521
00:34:07,417 --> 00:34:11,833
Renauld was an odd sort,
very secretive,

522
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:13,958
reclusive even, but...

523
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:15,583
he adored his wife.

524
00:34:22,875 --> 00:34:25,416
- You wanted to see me.

525
00:34:25,709 --> 00:34:30,291
Gabriel, what's happened?

526
00:34:30,584 --> 00:34:34,583
- Eloise, it's bad news.

527
00:34:34,875 --> 00:34:36,499
- What?

528
00:34:36,792 --> 00:34:37,833
- Madame Renauld,

529
00:34:38,125 --> 00:34:39,291
I'm sorry to have to tell you

530
00:34:39,584 --> 00:34:42,708
that your husband
has been found murdered.

531
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,999
- Oh, no.

532
00:34:44,292 --> 00:34:45,291
- He was stabbed last night

533
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:49,083
with the knife
that was taken from your room.

534
00:34:49,375 --> 00:34:53,874
- Oh, God.

535
00:34:54,167 --> 00:34:55,708
Why?

536
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,333
Why Paul?

537
00:34:59,834 --> 00:35:00,791
- Eloise...

538
00:35:11,584 --> 00:35:13,749
- It's this one here.

539
00:35:14,042 --> 00:35:15,499
- You don't believe her,
do you, Poirot?

540
00:35:15,792 --> 00:35:17,874
- I do not know, Hastings.

541
00:35:18,167 --> 00:35:20,958
This case,
it reminds me of something.

542
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:23,624
I just do not know.

543
00:35:23,917 --> 00:35:25,999
- This may be unpleasant.

544
00:35:26,292 --> 00:35:29,874
- Just one moment,
Monsieur Hautet.

545
00:35:30,167 --> 00:35:34,666
Madame Renauld,
the identification, it can wait.

546
00:35:34,959 --> 00:35:37,833
- No, I'd like
to get this over with.

547
00:35:45,375 --> 00:35:48,458
Paul?

548
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,666
No.

549
00:35:50,959 --> 00:35:53,333
Oh, no.

550
00:35:53,625 --> 00:35:56,166
No.

551
00:35:58,417 --> 00:36:01,124
- Take her back
to the Villa Genevieve.

552
00:36:06,209 --> 00:36:08,999
- I am an imbecile.

553
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:10,749
Truly, if there was ever
love and grief

554
00:36:11,042 --> 00:36:14,458
in the voice of a woman,
I heard it now.

555
00:36:15,834 --> 00:36:17,166
Et bien, Hastings.

556
00:36:17,459 --> 00:36:19,416
We must begin again.

557
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,458
- It's quite dreadful,
really quite dreadful,

558
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,541
the death of Monsieur Renauld.

559
00:36:26,834 --> 00:36:29,833
- Do you have any suspects yet?

560
00:36:30,125 --> 00:36:31,583
- At the present time,
mademoiselle,

561
00:36:31,875 --> 00:36:33,624
suspicion is directed
towards two persons.

562
00:36:33,917 --> 00:36:35,166
- Two?

563
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:37,166
- South Americans from Chile.

564
00:36:37,459 --> 00:36:39,749
- Oh.

565
00:36:40,042 --> 00:36:41,624
- Two suspects.

566
00:36:41,917 --> 00:36:45,374
Is that why it requires
the services of two detectives?

567
00:36:45,667 --> 00:36:47,666
- I-I'm handling this case,
madame.

568
00:36:47,959 --> 00:36:50,833
Monsieur Poirot
is merely observing.

569
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:53,374
- Well, I have nothing
to tell you.

570
00:36:53,667 --> 00:36:56,083
My daughter, Marthe, and I
lead quiet lives.

571
00:36:56,375 --> 00:36:58,791
- How long have you lived here
in the Villa Marguerite, madame?

572
00:36:59,084 --> 00:37:00,958
- Almost a year.

573
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:03,166
- My mother needed the sea air
for her health.

574
00:37:03,459 --> 00:37:05,999
- So you arrived here
after Monsieur Renauld?

575
00:37:06,292 --> 00:37:08,499
- Yes.
- Did you know him?

576
00:37:08,792 --> 00:37:10,458
- We met a few times.

577
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:12,666
- You became friends?

578
00:37:12,959 --> 00:37:14,916
- We became acquaintances.

579
00:37:15,209 --> 00:37:17,499
- Madame Daubreuil,

580
00:37:17,792 --> 00:37:18,833
on three occasions,

581
00:37:19,125 --> 00:37:21,624
Paul Renauld made
large payments to you.

582
00:37:24,792 --> 00:37:26,874
How do you explain that?

583
00:37:27,167 --> 00:37:28,666
- I don't.

584
00:37:28,959 --> 00:37:30,708
It is no business of yours.

585
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,874
- Madame--

586
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:33,083
- I'll handle this,

587
00:37:33,375 --> 00:37:35,333
if you don't mind,
Monsieur Poirot.

588
00:37:35,625 --> 00:37:36,874
Need I remind you, madame,

589
00:37:37,167 --> 00:37:39,583
that we are investigating
a murder.

590
00:37:39,875 --> 00:37:42,333
- Well, what of it?
I had nothing to do with it.

591
00:37:42,625 --> 00:37:44,958
- Then will you tell me, please,
what was the exact nature

592
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:47,083
of your relationship
with Paul Renauld?

593
00:37:47,375 --> 00:37:48,916
- I have nothing to say.
- Mother.

594
00:37:49,209 --> 00:37:51,249
- Was there an assignation
between you?

595
00:37:51,542 --> 00:37:53,166
- Monsieur, you insult me

596
00:37:53,459 --> 00:37:56,041
in my own house
in front of my daughter.

597
00:37:56,334 --> 00:37:57,833
You will leave now.

598
00:38:08,792 --> 00:38:11,458
- Your methods leave something
to be desired, monsieur.

599
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:13,749
- My methods work,
Monsieur Poirot,

600
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:16,291
as, if you insist
on staying around,

601
00:38:16,584 --> 00:38:17,499
you'll find out.

602
00:38:17,792 --> 00:38:19,999
- Ah, well, on that,
I do insist, monsieur.

603
00:38:20,292 --> 00:38:22,541
- Waste your time
if you want to.

604
00:38:25,167 --> 00:38:27,499
But I will find the murderer
of Paul Renauld before you.

605
00:38:27,792 --> 00:38:30,124
And that is a promise.

606
00:38:30,417 --> 00:38:32,499
- You would stake on that
your reputation?

607
00:38:32,792 --> 00:38:34,458
- I would stake anything.

608
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:37,333
In fact...

609
00:38:37,625 --> 00:38:39,041
I'll tell you what.

610
00:38:39,334 --> 00:38:43,083
How about a wager, Poirot?

611
00:38:43,375 --> 00:38:46,166
- And what would you wager
against me, Monsieur Giraud?

612
00:38:46,459 --> 00:38:48,208
- Name it.

613
00:38:50,792 --> 00:38:52,499
- Very well.
I will tell you.

614
00:38:52,792 --> 00:38:54,874
That famous pipe of yours.

615
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:56,999
- My pipe?
- Oui, monsieur.

616
00:38:57,292 --> 00:38:58,749
It is, how you say,
your trademark.

617
00:38:59,042 --> 00:39:00,499
If I solve this case before you,

618
00:39:00,792 --> 00:39:03,499
I will have the pipe.

619
00:39:03,792 --> 00:39:05,541
- Very well.

620
00:39:05,834 --> 00:39:09,374
And what is your trademark,
Monsieur Poirot?

621
00:39:09,667 --> 00:39:11,624
How about that famous moustache?

622
00:39:11,917 --> 00:39:13,291
- You can't be serious.

623
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:14,791
- What better way
to show the world

624
00:39:15,084 --> 00:39:16,333
who was the master here?

625
00:39:16,625 --> 00:39:19,458
You lose,
you shave your moustache.

626
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:21,916
What do you say?

627
00:39:22,209 --> 00:39:23,749
- Poirot.

628
00:39:32,417 --> 00:39:33,958
I hope you know
what you're doing, Poirot.

629
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:35,374
- Oh, mon ami,

630
00:39:35,667 --> 00:39:38,541
you must not concern yourself
with Giraud.

631
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:41,083
But tell me, Hastings,

632
00:39:41,375 --> 00:39:42,666
what is your opinion
of the two ladies

633
00:39:42,959 --> 00:39:44,999
that we met
at the Villa Marguerite?

634
00:39:45,292 --> 00:39:47,499
- Well, I don't know
about Madame Daubreuil,

635
00:39:47,792 --> 00:39:50,041
but it seems to me
that her daughter, Marthe,

636
00:39:50,334 --> 00:39:52,208
was worried about something.

637
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,291
- She certainly had
the eyes most anxious,

638
00:39:54,584 --> 00:39:55,874
did she not?

639
00:39:56,167 --> 00:39:59,083
But the mother, Hastings,

640
00:39:59,375 --> 00:40:01,791
where have I seen
that face before?

641
00:40:07,042 --> 00:40:08,041
- I thought
I might go for a swim

642
00:40:08,334 --> 00:40:09,833
before breakfast tomorrow,
Poirot.

643
00:40:10,125 --> 00:40:11,958
- That is a madness that,
Hastings,

644
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:13,541
and suffered
only by the English.

645
00:40:44,667 --> 00:40:46,499
Oh, excuse me.

646
00:40:46,792 --> 00:40:49,041
- Well, don't I know you?
- Do you?

647
00:40:49,334 --> 00:40:51,874
- You're the singer
from the hotel the other night.

648
00:40:52,167 --> 00:40:53,999
- You must have
a good memory for faces.

649
00:40:54,292 --> 00:40:57,124
- Well, no,
but I thought you were splendid,

650
00:40:57,417 --> 00:40:59,249
really wonderful.

651
00:40:59,542 --> 00:41:00,958
- That's kind of you.

652
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,666
I'm Isabelle Duveen.

653
00:41:02,959 --> 00:41:04,249
- Arthur Hastings.

654
00:41:04,542 --> 00:41:05,624
Have you been in?
- Yes.

655
00:41:05,917 --> 00:41:07,458
It's freezing.

656
00:41:09,209 --> 00:41:10,541
- You're shivering.

657
00:41:13,459 --> 00:41:15,041
- I was in Honfleur last year

658
00:41:15,334 --> 00:41:17,666
and Paris before that.

659
00:41:17,959 --> 00:41:19,166
But I like Deauville best.

660
00:41:19,459 --> 00:41:21,416
- When did you come here?

661
00:41:21,709 --> 00:41:22,833
- At the start of the season.

662
00:41:23,125 --> 00:41:25,124
Deauville is so beautiful.

663
00:41:25,417 --> 00:41:27,791
And I was happy here,

664
00:41:28,084 --> 00:41:29,958
very happy.

665
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:33,541
I thought...

666
00:41:33,834 --> 00:41:34,833
It all went wrong, really.

667
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:38,624
- Is that why your songs
are so sad?

668
00:41:38,917 --> 00:41:41,041
- L'addition, monsieur.
- Oh, thank you.

669
00:41:46,042 --> 00:41:48,583
Did you hear about that murder
that happened here yesterday?

670
00:41:48,875 --> 00:41:49,791
- On the links?

671
00:41:50,084 --> 00:41:52,499
- Yes, I was the one
who discovered the body.

672
00:41:52,792 --> 00:41:54,458
- Gosh.

673
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:56,041
How thrilling.

674
00:41:56,334 --> 00:41:58,624
I'm afraid I absolutely
dote on crimes.

675
00:41:58,917 --> 00:42:00,124
- Oh, do you?

676
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:01,291
As a matter of fact,

677
00:42:01,584 --> 00:42:03,124
I'm staying here
with Hercule Poirot.

678
00:42:03,417 --> 00:42:05,749
- The detective?
- Yes.

679
00:42:06,042 --> 00:42:07,374
- Is he as brilliant
as they say?

680
00:42:07,667 --> 00:42:09,041
- Oh, absolutely.

681
00:42:09,334 --> 00:42:10,791
- I must say,

682
00:42:11,084 --> 00:42:13,749
I'd hate to have him
on my trail.

683
00:42:14,042 --> 00:42:14,958
Where is he now?

684
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:17,333
- Oh, still having breakfast,
I should think.

685
00:42:17,625 --> 00:42:20,874
Actually, I ought to be going.

686
00:42:23,709 --> 00:42:25,249
Isabelle.

687
00:42:25,542 --> 00:42:28,208
Do you think
I could see you again?

688
00:42:29,542 --> 00:42:32,249
- We could go out for lunch
if you like.

689
00:42:32,542 --> 00:42:34,416
- Oh, could we?

690
00:42:34,709 --> 00:42:36,291
- This is my address.

691
00:42:39,792 --> 00:42:42,791
Why don't you call for me?

692
00:42:43,084 --> 00:42:44,541
- Right.

693
00:42:44,834 --> 00:42:46,249
Rue des Escaliers.

694
00:42:46,542 --> 00:42:48,958
- It's not very chic,
I'm afraid.

695
00:42:50,792 --> 00:42:51,916
- Thank you.

696
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:56,666
- Bye.
- Bye.

697
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:15,291
- Hastings.

698
00:43:15,584 --> 00:43:16,499
How very kind of you.

699
00:43:16,792 --> 00:43:17,833
You arrive at last.

700
00:43:18,125 --> 00:43:19,083
- Oh, steady, old Poirot.

701
00:43:19,375 --> 00:43:20,958
As a matter of fact,
I just met someone.

702
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:23,541
- Someone?
A young lady, no doubt, eh?

703
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:25,041
Oh, Hastings.

704
00:43:25,334 --> 00:43:27,291
Your face is as the open book.

705
00:43:27,584 --> 00:43:29,499
But there is no time to talk
about this now, mon ami.

706
00:43:29,792 --> 00:43:30,833
We must go at once.

707
00:43:31,125 --> 00:43:33,166
Monsieur Jack Renauld
has returned to Deauville,

708
00:43:33,459 --> 00:43:36,833
and Giraud is interrogating him
at the préfecture.

709
00:43:52,917 --> 00:43:55,749
- You have no right
to hold me here.

710
00:43:56,042 --> 00:43:57,458
- I have every right.

711
00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:00,791
- I told you...

712
00:44:01,084 --> 00:44:02,833
I decided not to sail,

713
00:44:03,125 --> 00:44:07,749
but at the same time,
I didn't want to go home.

714
00:44:08,042 --> 00:44:09,541
I would just have had
another argument

715
00:44:09,834 --> 00:44:12,499
with my stepfather.

716
00:44:12,792 --> 00:44:14,208
- So on the night of the murder,

717
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:17,874
you remained in Cherbourg.

718
00:44:18,167 --> 00:44:20,624
- Yes.

719
00:44:20,917 --> 00:44:24,708
I stayed in Cherbourg all night.

720
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,958
I only saw the news
in the paper this morning.

721
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:30,208
- And you came straight home?

722
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:31,583
That's right.

723
00:44:31,875 --> 00:44:34,083
But my mother was out,

724
00:44:34,375 --> 00:44:38,624
and I was waiting for her
when he called.

725
00:44:38,917 --> 00:44:42,499
The next thing I know,
I was dragged here.

726
00:44:42,792 --> 00:44:45,041
- For questioning.

727
00:44:45,334 --> 00:44:46,874
- If you think
you can intimidate me,

728
00:44:47,167 --> 00:44:48,416
you're wrong.

729
00:44:48,709 --> 00:44:51,208
- Monsieur Renauld.

730
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,458
What was the purpose
of your journey to Santiago?

731
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:56,791
My stepfather wouldn't say.

732
00:45:01,875 --> 00:45:04,833
He seemed to think
there was some--

733
00:45:05,125 --> 00:45:06,458
some sort of fraud going on,

734
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:10,666
something to do with his
business in precious stones.

735
00:45:10,959 --> 00:45:13,083
It couldn't have come
at a worse time for me.

736
00:45:13,375 --> 00:45:15,249
- In what way?

737
00:45:15,542 --> 00:45:19,416
- It's the race this week.

738
00:45:19,709 --> 00:45:21,749
The Trophée de Deauville?

739
00:45:22,042 --> 00:45:22,833
- You're taking part?

740
00:45:23,125 --> 00:45:24,333
- Yes.

741
00:45:24,625 --> 00:45:27,416
And I came fifth last year.

742
00:45:29,042 --> 00:45:31,249
I mean to do better this time.

743
00:45:31,542 --> 00:45:34,249
That is, unless you intend
to keep me here.

744
00:45:34,542 --> 00:45:35,791
- No, no, no, Monsieur Renauld.

745
00:45:36,084 --> 00:45:37,749
You may go.

746
00:45:38,042 --> 00:45:39,958
- If you don't mind,
Monsieur Poirot,

747
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:41,958
that decision is mine to make.

748
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:44,166
- Pardon, monsieur.

749
00:45:44,459 --> 00:45:47,958
You wish to arrest
Monsieur Renauld?

750
00:45:49,459 --> 00:45:50,999
- Not yet.

751
00:45:55,584 --> 00:45:57,208
- Oh, Jack.

752
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,958
Oh, darling.

753
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:01,249
- Oh, Mother.

754
00:46:02,625 --> 00:46:03,958
- So you didn't go?

755
00:46:05,459 --> 00:46:08,791
Well, it doesn't matter now.

756
00:46:09,084 --> 00:46:10,833
Not now.

757
00:46:15,959 --> 00:46:17,916
- Monsieur Poirot.
- Oui?

758
00:46:18,209 --> 00:46:20,041
Ah, merci.

759
00:46:20,334 --> 00:46:21,749
- What is it?

760
00:46:22,042 --> 00:46:23,666
- It is the coat
of Monsieur Renauld.

761
00:46:23,959 --> 00:46:24,916
- Jack Renauld?

762
00:46:25,209 --> 00:46:26,958
- Yes, sir,
I took it off him this morning.

763
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:28,874
Monsieur Poirot asked me
to hold it back.

764
00:46:29,167 --> 00:46:31,291
- Merci.
If you please, Hastings.

765
00:46:31,584 --> 00:46:33,583
- Hey, you take your orders
from me,

766
00:46:33,875 --> 00:46:34,791
not from Monsieur Poirot.

767
00:46:35,084 --> 00:46:35,958
Is that clear?

768
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:37,124
- Yes, sir.

769
00:46:37,417 --> 00:46:38,749
Sorry, sir.

770
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:46,124
- What the hell
do you think you're doing?

771
00:46:46,417 --> 00:46:47,624
- Measuring the coat.

772
00:46:47,917 --> 00:46:49,624
- I can see that.

773
00:46:49,917 --> 00:46:52,916
- Hmm.
Just as I thought.

774
00:46:53,209 --> 00:46:56,708
- What?

775
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,999
- The coat, it is short.

776
00:47:04,625 --> 00:47:05,583
Hastings, I must leave

777
00:47:05,875 --> 00:47:07,291
on the first possible
train for London.

778
00:47:07,584 --> 00:47:08,499
- What?
But why?

779
00:47:08,792 --> 00:47:10,124
- Because the face
of Madame Daubreuil,

780
00:47:10,417 --> 00:47:11,208
it is known to me.

781
00:47:11,459 --> 00:47:12,249
I have seen it before.

782
00:47:12,542 --> 00:47:13,958
Also, there is something
about this case

783
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:15,374
that is familiar to me.

784
00:47:15,667 --> 00:47:17,249
- But why London?

785
00:47:17,542 --> 00:47:20,791
- Because that is where
the answer is to be found.

786
00:47:21,084 --> 00:47:22,541
Hastings.

787
00:47:22,834 --> 00:47:24,999
I wish to know at what hour
the last train left Deauville

788
00:47:25,292 --> 00:47:26,958
on the night of the death
of Monsieur Renauld.

789
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:28,166
- Right.

790
00:47:28,459 --> 00:47:30,041
- And go also to the office
of Monsieur Bex

791
00:47:30,334 --> 00:47:31,666
and tell to him
where I have gone.

792
00:47:31,959 --> 00:47:33,374
- When shall I say
you'll be back?

793
00:47:33,667 --> 00:47:37,916
- Oh, when I have discovered
the truth, Hastings.

794
00:47:58,334 --> 00:48:01,791
- How's the Deauville sole?
- Delicious.

795
00:48:04,709 --> 00:48:06,291
You're not married, are you?

796
00:48:06,584 --> 00:48:08,499
- Oh, good heavens, no.

797
00:48:08,792 --> 00:48:10,041
- Have you ever been?

798
00:48:10,334 --> 00:48:11,958
- No.

799
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:16,999
I--oh, I suppose
I never found the right girl.

800
00:48:17,292 --> 00:48:19,791
- You're lucky.

801
00:48:20,084 --> 00:48:23,374
- Am I?

802
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:26,208
- The right girl,
the right man,

803
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,166
no one can hurt you more.

804
00:48:29,959 --> 00:48:34,874
- How did you come to be hurt,
Isabelle?

805
00:48:35,167 --> 00:48:37,041
- Forget it.

806
00:48:37,334 --> 00:48:41,416
I don't want to spoil
a nice lunch.

807
00:48:41,709 --> 00:48:43,041
Tell me about the case.

808
00:48:43,334 --> 00:48:46,208
Have you found these mysterious
South Americans yet?

809
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:47,749
- No.

810
00:48:48,042 --> 00:48:49,791
Poirot seems to think
they don't exist.

811
00:48:50,084 --> 00:48:52,208
But it doesn't make sense.

812
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,374
- Go on.

813
00:48:54,667 --> 00:48:56,124
- Paul Renauld,
a multimillionaire

814
00:48:56,417 --> 00:48:58,583
who seems to have no background
or history,

815
00:48:58,875 --> 00:49:00,958
is found stabbed in the back
on a golf course.

816
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:02,374
- Yes.

817
00:49:02,667 --> 00:49:04,666
- Well, if he wasn't abducted
and taken there,

818
00:49:04,959 --> 00:49:06,041
what was he doing
out on the links

819
00:49:06,334 --> 00:49:07,333
in the middle of the night

820
00:49:07,625 --> 00:49:09,874
wearing only a coat
and underclothes?

821
00:49:10,167 --> 00:49:11,208
- I see what you mean.

822
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,833
- Personally,
I suspect his wife.

823
00:49:14,125 --> 00:49:16,624
- Madame Renauld?
Why?

824
00:49:16,917 --> 00:49:18,291
- Well, if Poirot's right,

825
00:49:18,584 --> 00:49:19,416
and there were no intruders,

826
00:49:19,709 --> 00:49:20,958
she must have made them up.

827
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:22,374
And the only reason
she'd do that

828
00:49:22,667 --> 00:49:24,374
is if she killed him herself.

829
00:49:24,667 --> 00:49:26,083
- But did she have a motive?

830
00:49:26,375 --> 00:49:27,583
- Well, there's always money.

831
00:49:27,875 --> 00:49:30,041
Paul Renauld
was a very rich man.

832
00:49:30,334 --> 00:49:32,958
And it seems he was having
an affair with his neighbor,

833
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:34,541
Bernadette Daubreuil.

834
00:49:34,834 --> 00:49:36,958
- How did you find out that?

835
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:38,416
- She wrote him a letter.

836
00:49:38,709 --> 00:49:40,833
She signed it B.D.

837
00:49:43,917 --> 00:49:45,499
- But that doesn't
necessarily mean she--

838
00:49:45,792 --> 00:49:47,541
- Well, no,
but we also discovered

839
00:49:47,834 --> 00:49:49,374
that Paul Renauld
paid Madame Daubreuil

840
00:49:49,667 --> 00:49:52,916
a large sum of money.

841
00:49:53,209 --> 00:49:54,791
Okay, Isabelle.

842
00:49:55,084 --> 00:49:57,624
I really shouldn't be
telling you any of this.

843
00:49:59,084 --> 00:50:02,374
- My lips are sealed.

844
00:50:07,125 --> 00:50:08,916
- Thank you, Arthur.
That was a lovely lunch.

845
00:50:09,209 --> 00:50:10,499
- Oh, don't thank me.

846
00:50:10,792 --> 00:50:13,708
I can't remember the last time
I enjoyed myself so much.

847
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,124
- Where are you off to now?

848
00:50:15,417 --> 00:50:16,874
- Oh, I have to do something
for Poirot.

849
00:50:17,167 --> 00:50:19,458
He wants me to go and see
the Commissar of Police.

850
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:22,333
- Oh.
Do you mind if I tag along?

851
00:50:22,625 --> 00:50:24,083
- Well, why would you
want to do that?

852
00:50:24,375 --> 00:50:25,749
- I enjoy your company.

853
00:50:26,042 --> 00:50:26,999
And I told you,

854
00:50:27,292 --> 00:50:29,999
I'm absolutely fascinated
by crime.

855
00:50:30,292 --> 00:50:31,749
- Right.

856
00:50:42,334 --> 00:50:43,833
- Monsieur Bex
said to wait in his office,

857
00:50:44,125 --> 00:50:44,916
Captain Hastings.

858
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:46,249
He'll be with you shortly.

859
00:50:46,542 --> 00:50:47,749
- Thank you very much.

860
00:50:53,459 --> 00:50:54,583
- Is this where he lived?

861
00:50:54,875 --> 00:50:57,333
- Yes.

862
00:50:57,625 --> 00:50:58,999
- And that's where
you found him?

863
00:50:59,292 --> 00:51:01,583
- Yes.

864
00:51:01,875 --> 00:51:03,208
- Stabbed in the back.

865
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:07,374
- Look, Isabelle, I'm not sure
this is a very good idea.

866
00:51:07,667 --> 00:51:08,708
- Don't worry.

867
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,083
I'm all for the horrors.

868
00:51:12,375 --> 00:51:13,541
What's that?

869
00:51:13,834 --> 00:51:15,874
- Uh, they're footprints
from the scene of the crime.

870
00:51:16,167 --> 00:51:19,833
They took a cast.

871
00:51:20,125 --> 00:51:21,291
- And this?

872
00:51:21,584 --> 00:51:24,874
- Uh, that's the knife
that was used.

873
00:51:25,167 --> 00:51:27,499
- The knife?
- Yes.

874
00:51:27,792 --> 00:51:29,916
- Oh.

875
00:51:30,209 --> 00:51:31,458
- Christ's sake.
Are you all right?

876
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:34,291
- Oh, yes.
- Are you sure?

877
00:51:34,584 --> 00:51:37,291
- Yes.
- Come and sit down.

878
00:51:39,875 --> 00:51:41,791
- Do you think you could get me
some water?

879
00:51:42,084 --> 00:51:42,958
Please?

880
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:45,291
- I'll be back in a minute.

881
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:01,083
- Women and crime,
Captain Hastings,

882
00:52:01,375 --> 00:52:02,416
they don't mix.

883
00:52:02,709 --> 00:52:04,083
- She was all right to start...

884
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,624
She's gone.

885
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:12,833
- Was she interested in anything
in particular, Captain Hastings?

886
00:52:13,125 --> 00:52:14,999
- Uh...

887
00:52:15,292 --> 00:52:17,958
- What was it that upset her?

888
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:20,249
- I really have no idea.

889
00:52:38,834 --> 00:52:39,791
- Monsieur Letts?

890
00:52:40,084 --> 00:52:42,416
- Ah, Mr. Poirot.

891
00:52:42,709 --> 00:52:44,541
And how may I help you?

892
00:52:47,084 --> 00:52:50,249
Yes, I know exactly what you're
talking about, Monsieur Poirot.

893
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:51,916
Now, I entered
the newsroom myself.

894
00:52:52,209 --> 00:52:53,333
And I was there at the trial.

895
00:52:53,625 --> 00:52:54,833
- When was this, Monsieur Letts?

896
00:52:55,125 --> 00:52:58,124
- Oh, must have been
a good ten years ago.

897
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,124
Ah, there we are.

898
00:53:08,375 --> 00:53:10,124
The Beroldy case.

899
00:53:10,417 --> 00:53:12,208
- I wonder if you could help me.
- Monsieur?

900
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:14,458
- I'm making inquiries
for a friend of mine.

901
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:17,208
I need to know what time
the last train left Deauville

902
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:18,624
two nights ago.

903
00:53:18,917 --> 00:53:20,249
- Tuesday, monsieur?

904
00:53:20,542 --> 00:53:23,416
That would have been the
7 minutes past 12:00 to Paris.

905
00:53:23,709 --> 00:53:26,666
- You didn't happen to see
two foreigners getting on?

906
00:53:26,959 --> 00:53:28,041
South Americans?

907
00:53:28,334 --> 00:53:29,458
- No, monsieur.

908
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:31,541
- How about this man?

909
00:53:31,834 --> 00:53:34,124
- Giraud.
- Have you seen him?

910
00:53:34,417 --> 00:53:35,374
Well?

911
00:53:35,667 --> 00:53:36,624
- Yes, monsieur.

912
00:53:36,917 --> 00:53:38,708
But he wasn't getting
on the train.

913
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,249
- No?
- No.

914
00:53:40,542 --> 00:53:42,833
He arrived on the last train
from Cherbourg.

915
00:53:43,125 --> 00:53:46,833
I noticed him because
he appeared to be so...nervous.

916
00:53:47,125 --> 00:53:48,416
- And what time was that?

917
00:53:48,709 --> 00:53:50,874
- 11:40.

918
00:53:51,167 --> 00:53:52,916
- Jack Renauld.

919
00:53:55,792 --> 00:53:56,624
- Mm.

920
00:53:56,917 --> 00:53:58,958
That story
about the masked intruders,

921
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:00,958
you know, the ones
who supposedly abducted

922
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:02,208
Arnold Beroldy,

923
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:04,041
it was all made up.

924
00:54:04,334 --> 00:54:06,833
- And this Madame Beroldy,

925
00:54:07,125 --> 00:54:08,624
it was her hands,
was it not?

926
00:54:08,917 --> 00:54:10,666
They were not, um...

927
00:54:10,959 --> 00:54:11,916
fastened together tightly?

928
00:54:12,209 --> 00:54:14,916
- That's right.
It's what gave her away.

929
00:54:15,209 --> 00:54:16,874
Her lover, George Connor,

930
00:54:17,167 --> 00:54:18,916
didn't want to hurt her.

931
00:54:19,209 --> 00:54:21,083
- Ah, yes,
it all comes back to me now.

932
00:54:21,375 --> 00:54:24,083
Madame Beroldy,
she did not hang.

933
00:54:24,375 --> 00:54:26,791
- No, she--
- Ready, Mr. Letts.

934
00:54:27,084 --> 00:54:29,041
- Run it.

935
00:54:29,334 --> 00:54:30,458
- Masked intruders break into...

936
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:32,708
- Before the verdict
was passed,

937
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,166
she admitted her story
was a lie,

938
00:54:35,459 --> 00:54:37,999
threw herself on the mercy
of the jury.

939
00:54:38,292 --> 00:54:39,833
The real murderer
was the partner,

940
00:54:40,125 --> 00:54:41,874
George Connor,
she said.

941
00:54:42,167 --> 00:54:43,791
It was all his plan.

942
00:54:44,084 --> 00:54:45,541
He'd killed her husband

943
00:54:45,834 --> 00:54:48,083
and forced her
to go along with him.

944
00:54:48,375 --> 00:54:50,208
Personally, I think there was
more to it than that.

945
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:52,083
- If you would
please to tell me.

946
00:54:52,375 --> 00:54:55,416
- Well, he may have
struck the blow,

947
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:56,541
but she planned it.

948
00:54:56,834 --> 00:54:58,124
- Hmm.

949
00:54:58,417 --> 00:54:59,666
And of course,
it was Madame Beroldy

950
00:54:59,959 --> 00:55:00,874
who inherited from her husband

951
00:55:01,167 --> 00:55:02,666
the money
from his coffee business.

952
00:55:02,959 --> 00:55:04,333
- Absolutely.

953
00:55:04,625 --> 00:55:06,124
She had nerves of steel,
that woman.

954
00:55:06,417 --> 00:55:07,374
- Mm.

955
00:55:07,667 --> 00:55:10,416
- In a way,
I think she was rather horrible.

956
00:55:10,709 --> 00:55:13,874
- And this George Connor,
was he arrested?

957
00:55:14,167 --> 00:55:15,916
- Uh, no.
That's him there.

958
00:55:16,209 --> 00:55:19,124
- Monsieur Beroldy's partner,
George Connor.

959
00:55:19,417 --> 00:55:21,041
But before the police
can apprehend him...

960
00:55:21,334 --> 00:55:23,833
- Ah, yes.

961
00:55:24,125 --> 00:55:26,708
A face that is to me
most familiar.

962
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,916
- Yeah, he managed
to escape the country.

963
00:55:30,209 --> 00:55:32,333
- To South America.
- Yes.

964
00:55:32,625 --> 00:55:34,999
The police never found him.

965
00:55:35,292 --> 00:55:37,041
- And what of Madame Beroldy?

966
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:41,791
The amazing thing is,
is she was acquitted.

967
00:55:42,084 --> 00:55:45,458
Well, it was quite
a performance.

968
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:46,749
- Uh-huh.

969
00:55:47,042 --> 00:55:48,541
- Uh, that's her there
with her daughter

970
00:55:48,834 --> 00:55:50,333
after the verdict.

971
00:55:58,334 --> 00:56:00,041
She left the country later on,

972
00:56:00,334 --> 00:56:02,124
changed her name.

973
00:56:03,917 --> 00:56:05,124
- Oui.

974
00:56:06,875 --> 00:56:09,416
To Madame Bernadette Daubreuil.

975
00:56:14,125 --> 00:56:15,583
- With the station master
as evidence,

976
00:56:15,875 --> 00:56:18,791
my case is getting stronger
by the minute.

977
00:56:20,459 --> 00:56:21,791
- So Jack Renauld was lying
when he said

978
00:56:22,084 --> 00:56:24,083
he was in Cherbourg the night
his stepfather was killed.

979
00:56:24,375 --> 00:56:25,499
He was actually here
in Deauville.

980
00:56:25,792 --> 00:56:26,583
- You better tell Poirot.

981
00:56:26,834 --> 00:56:28,999
- Oh, I expect
he already knows.

982
00:56:29,292 --> 00:56:30,208
- You can wait here.

983
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,458
I want another word
with Madame Renauld.

984
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:33,999
- Right.

985
00:56:58,209 --> 00:57:00,166
- Marthe, calm down.
Calm down.

986
00:57:00,459 --> 00:57:03,041
It'll be all right.
It'll be all right.

987
00:57:03,334 --> 00:57:05,499
- Why can't it be over, Jack,

988
00:57:05,792 --> 00:57:07,291
this whole horrible business?

989
00:57:07,584 --> 00:57:09,208
- It will be soon, darling.

990
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:12,041
- And then what about us?

991
00:57:12,334 --> 00:57:15,874
- You know what I want, love.

992
00:57:16,167 --> 00:57:18,291
I can't live without you.

993
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:43,374
- What is it?
- It's another body.

994
00:57:43,667 --> 00:57:45,583
- Oh, sir.

995
00:57:45,875 --> 00:57:48,249
- The knife, Captain Hastings.

996
00:57:48,542 --> 00:57:49,916
Look at the knife.

997
00:58:17,834 --> 00:58:19,499
- Hastings, you've received
my telegram?

998
00:58:19,792 --> 00:58:21,666
Bon.
- Poirot.

999
00:58:21,959 --> 00:58:23,458
- I have succeeded, mon ami.

1000
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:25,083
I have succeeded to the marvel.

1001
00:58:25,375 --> 00:58:29,083
- Poirot, I have to tell you,
there's been another murder.

1002
00:58:29,375 --> 00:58:30,166
- A second murder?

1003
00:58:30,459 --> 00:58:32,999
- Committed with
an identical knife.

1004
00:58:35,125 --> 00:58:36,124
- Not an identical knife.

1005
00:58:36,417 --> 00:58:37,749
The same knife
that killed Paul Renauld,

1006
00:58:38,042 --> 00:58:39,624
which was stolen
from this very office

1007
00:58:39,917 --> 00:58:41,916
by the woman that
Captain Hastings brought here.

1008
00:58:42,209 --> 00:58:44,291
- We can't be sure of that,
Monsieur Giraud.

1009
00:58:44,584 --> 00:58:46,083
- The knife vanishes;
the knife reappears.

1010
00:58:46,375 --> 00:58:48,541
What more do you want?

1011
00:58:48,834 --> 00:58:51,208
- It is a very serious business,
Captain Hastings.

1012
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:53,749
- To bring a complete stranger
into police headquarters

1013
00:58:54,042 --> 00:58:54,999
and then to just leave her here.

1014
00:58:55,292 --> 00:58:56,666
I can't believe
the incompetence of it.

1015
00:58:56,959 --> 00:58:59,833
- And you have not be able
to find this young woman?

1016
00:59:00,125 --> 00:59:02,791
- We're looking, but we only
have her description to go on.

1017
00:59:03,084 --> 00:59:05,291
- You wait until I get
my hands on her.

1018
00:59:05,584 --> 00:59:06,958
- You've no idea who she was?

1019
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:10,041
- Uh, no.
We met on the beach.

1020
00:59:10,334 --> 00:59:11,749
She didn't tell me her name.

1021
00:59:12,042 --> 00:59:13,874
- She must have
told you something.

1022
00:59:14,167 --> 00:59:16,583
- No, not really.

1023
00:59:20,625 --> 00:59:23,083
- And you believe this to be
the same knife

1024
00:59:23,375 --> 00:59:25,166
that killed
Monsieur Paul Renauld.

1025
00:59:25,459 --> 00:59:27,291
- A paper knife with a stone
set in the hilt,

1026
00:59:27,584 --> 00:59:30,291
it certainly looks the same.

1027
00:59:30,584 --> 00:59:32,083
- But why take it to...

1028
00:59:35,417 --> 00:59:37,541
Doesn't make sense.

1029
00:59:41,084 --> 00:59:42,833
- Bonjour, Dr. Hautet.

1030
00:59:43,125 --> 00:59:44,666
- Well, the first thing
that you ought to know

1031
00:59:44,959 --> 00:59:47,583
is that this man was stabbed
after he died.

1032
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:49,749
- What?

1033
00:59:50,042 --> 00:59:52,208
- Look at the wound.

1034
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:54,499
The knife was lodged
in his heart,

1035
00:59:54,792 --> 00:59:57,166
but there's no blood.

1036
00:59:57,459 --> 00:59:58,916
- Then what did he die of?

1037
00:59:59,209 --> 01:00:01,124
- It's too soon to say.

1038
01:00:01,417 --> 01:00:03,833
But I'd guess
an epileptic fit.

1039
01:00:04,125 --> 01:00:06,874
- But why stab a man
who's already dead?

1040
01:00:07,167 --> 01:00:09,458
- To create an impression,
Hastings.

1041
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:10,833
- What impression?

1042
01:00:11,125 --> 01:00:13,624
- The impression that
it very nearly did create.

1043
01:00:13,917 --> 01:00:14,999
- You've no idea who he is?

1044
01:00:15,292 --> 01:00:17,666
- No identification.
Nothing.

1045
01:00:17,959 --> 01:00:21,499
Look at his hair,
his fingernails.

1046
01:00:21,792 --> 01:00:23,166
I'd have said he was a tramp.

1047
01:00:23,459 --> 01:00:24,499
- And yet his clothes were those

1048
01:00:24,792 --> 01:00:26,208
of a man well-to-do,
n'est-ce pas?

1049
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:27,916
C'est curieux.

1050
01:00:28,209 --> 01:00:30,916
- We found those in the shed.

1051
01:00:31,209 --> 01:00:32,958
Some old clothes.

1052
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:34,958
They could be the tramp's or--

1053
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:36,291
- The gardener's?

1054
01:00:36,584 --> 01:00:39,583
- Do you think so?
- Yes.

1055
01:00:39,875 --> 01:00:40,958
What about the time of death?

1056
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:43,416
- No, he's been dead
quite a while.

1057
01:00:43,709 --> 01:00:45,124
Possibly four or five days.

1058
01:00:45,417 --> 01:00:49,291
- And so it would appear
that the death of this man

1059
01:00:49,584 --> 01:00:53,666
occurred before the death
of Monsieur Paul Renauld.

1060
01:00:53,959 --> 01:00:57,666
- You're just trying
to confuse the issue, Poirot.

1061
01:00:57,959 --> 01:01:00,458
- You do not find it
to be confused, Monsieur Giraud?

1062
01:01:00,750 --> 01:01:02,499
- Oh, no.

1063
01:01:02,792 --> 01:01:04,541
As a matter of fact,
I'm ready to make an arrest.

1064
01:01:04,834 --> 01:01:07,708
You are?

1065
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,499
- It's that race this afternoon,
isn't it?

1066
01:01:09,792 --> 01:01:10,916
The Trophée de Deauville?

1067
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:12,249
- Yes.

1068
01:01:12,542 --> 01:01:14,083
- What time is it
expected to end?

1069
01:01:14,375 --> 01:01:15,583
- 4:00.

1070
01:01:15,875 --> 01:01:17,999
- We'll do it then.

1071
01:01:18,292 --> 01:01:20,749
And what more suitable venue
than the finishing line?

1072
01:01:21,042 --> 01:01:22,291
- Right.

1073
01:01:22,584 --> 01:01:24,374
- Bad luck, Poirot.

1074
01:01:24,667 --> 01:01:27,541
But I told you, didn't I?

1075
01:01:27,834 --> 01:01:29,833
You've met the better man.

1076
01:01:40,292 --> 01:01:41,249
- And so you see, mon ami,

1077
01:01:41,542 --> 01:01:44,333
it is what I found out
in London.

1078
01:01:44,625 --> 01:01:46,833
And that is the key
to this mystery most bizarre.

1079
01:01:47,125 --> 01:01:48,874
- I just can't believe it,
Poirot.

1080
01:01:49,167 --> 01:01:51,041
Ten years ago,
Jean Beroldy is accused

1081
01:01:51,334 --> 01:01:52,583
of murdering her husband,

1082
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:54,916
and now she's living here
in Deauville under the name of--

1083
01:01:55,209 --> 01:01:57,624
- Madame Daubreuil?
Exactement.

1084
01:01:57,917 --> 01:02:00,458
- Shouldn't you confront her
or something?

1085
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:02,999
- I think it will serve
no useful purpose, Hastings,

1086
01:02:03,292 --> 01:02:05,416
and after all, to change a name,
it is no crime.

1087
01:02:05,709 --> 01:02:08,041
- But it must have been she
who murdered Paul Renauld.

1088
01:02:08,334 --> 01:02:09,541
- And the motive, Hastings?

1089
01:02:09,834 --> 01:02:11,208
- Well, the letter.

1090
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:13,791
She said she would kill him
rather than lose him.

1091
01:02:14,084 --> 01:02:15,291
- Pardon.

1092
01:02:15,584 --> 01:02:16,749
But that is
because you still assume

1093
01:02:17,042 --> 01:02:19,249
that the B.D. of the letter
refers to Bernadette Daubreuil.

1094
01:02:19,542 --> 01:02:21,541
But of that,
we have no evidence.

1095
01:02:21,834 --> 01:02:23,499
- But it's the same crime,
Poirot.

1096
01:02:23,792 --> 01:02:24,874
The fake abduction.

1097
01:02:25,167 --> 01:02:27,083
- No, no, no, no, mon ami.
You forget.

1098
01:02:27,375 --> 01:02:29,916
It was ten years ago
that Madame Daubreuil,

1099
01:02:30,209 --> 01:02:31,791
or Jean Beroldy,
as she was then called,

1100
01:02:32,084 --> 01:02:34,291
invented a story
of the masked intruders.

1101
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:37,791
Now, it is her neighbor,
Madame Renauld.

1102
01:02:38,084 --> 01:02:39,333
- Well, that's true.

1103
01:02:39,625 --> 01:02:40,583
- And there's one other question

1104
01:02:40,875 --> 01:02:42,083
you should ask yourself,
Hastings.

1105
01:02:42,375 --> 01:02:43,166
- What's that?

1106
01:02:43,459 --> 01:02:44,999
- What happened
to the true killer,

1107
01:02:45,292 --> 01:02:46,249
George Connor?

1108
01:02:46,542 --> 01:02:48,166
- Pardon, monsieur.

1109
01:02:48,459 --> 01:02:50,916
There's a young lady
in reception asking to see you.

1110
01:02:51,209 --> 01:02:52,833
- To see me?
- Oui, monsieur.

1111
01:02:53,125 --> 01:02:56,374
- Ah, perhaps
it is the young lady

1112
01:02:56,667 --> 01:02:57,999
of your acquaintance, Hastings.

1113
01:02:58,292 --> 01:02:59,458
- Oh, you mean...

1114
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:02,374
- Ah, yes, of course, her name,

1115
01:03:02,667 --> 01:03:04,291
it is still unknown to you.

1116
01:03:04,584 --> 01:03:05,583
- Yes.

1117
01:03:05,875 --> 01:03:09,291
- Et bien, we shall see.

1118
01:03:13,542 --> 01:03:14,874
- Bon appétit.

1119
01:03:20,459 --> 01:03:21,833
- Monsieur Poirot.

1120
01:03:29,084 --> 01:03:30,333
I hope you'll forgive me
coming here.

1121
01:03:30,625 --> 01:03:31,583
I had to see you.

1122
01:03:31,875 --> 01:03:33,083
- Mademoiselle.

1123
01:03:37,709 --> 01:03:38,916
Please.

1124
01:03:39,209 --> 01:03:42,041
- I'm afraid, Mr. Poirot,
terribly afraid.

1125
01:03:42,334 --> 01:03:44,124
- Mademoiselle?

1126
01:03:44,417 --> 01:03:47,999
- That horrible man
has just been to see me.

1127
01:03:48,292 --> 01:03:49,333
Giraud.

1128
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:51,541
- Ah.
- He's such a bully.

1129
01:03:51,834 --> 01:03:54,791
He's discovered that Jack was
here on the night of the murder.

1130
01:03:55,084 --> 01:03:57,416
- But if that is the case,
mademoiselle,

1131
01:03:57,709 --> 01:03:58,708
it was most unwise

1132
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,291
of Monsieur Jack Renauld
to concede.

1133
01:04:00,584 --> 01:04:04,374
- I know,
but that doesn't mean...

1134
01:04:04,667 --> 01:04:05,666
Monsieur Poirot,

1135
01:04:05,959 --> 01:04:07,999
Giraud is going to arrest him.

1136
01:04:08,292 --> 01:04:12,083
You can't let him.
Please.

1137
01:04:12,375 --> 01:04:13,708
I love him.

1138
01:04:17,459 --> 01:04:19,958
- Mademoiselle.
Shh.

1139
01:04:20,250 --> 01:04:21,499
- He's innocent,
Monsieur Poirot.

1140
01:04:21,792 --> 01:04:24,374
I know he is.

1141
01:04:24,667 --> 01:04:25,624
- And who do you believe

1142
01:04:25,917 --> 01:04:27,249
the true killer to be,
mademoiselle?

1143
01:04:27,542 --> 01:04:29,708
I know who it was.

1144
01:04:32,084 --> 01:04:33,999
- Tell it to me.

1145
01:04:34,292 --> 01:04:35,499
- The day before he died,

1146
01:04:35,792 --> 01:04:37,333
I heard someone
in Paul Renauld's garden.

1147
01:04:37,625 --> 01:04:38,541
- Mm-hmm.

1148
01:04:38,834 --> 01:04:40,124
- I climbed up
and looked over the wall,

1149
01:04:40,417 --> 01:04:41,249
and that was when I saw him.

1150
01:04:41,542 --> 01:04:42,583
- Who?

1151
01:04:42,875 --> 01:04:44,083
- A tramp.

1152
01:04:44,375 --> 01:04:46,874
He was a dreadful-looking
creature dressed in rags.

1153
01:04:47,167 --> 01:04:48,541
Paul Renauld
tried to calm him down,

1154
01:04:48,834 --> 01:04:49,749
but he wouldn't listen.

1155
01:04:50,042 --> 01:04:50,958
He was demanding money.

1156
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:52,624
- And you believe
that this was the man?

1157
01:04:52,917 --> 01:04:55,874
- Jack and his stepfather
had their differences, but...

1158
01:04:56,167 --> 01:04:57,333
- Mademoiselle,

1159
01:04:57,625 --> 01:04:59,374
if I am to save
Monsieur Jack Renauld,

1160
01:04:59,667 --> 01:05:04,041
it is necessary that I speak
with him without delay.

1161
01:05:04,334 --> 01:05:05,833
- You're too late.

1162
01:05:06,125 --> 01:05:09,374
The race, it'll be starting
in a few minutes' time.

1163
01:05:09,667 --> 01:05:10,999
- The race
that Giraud mentioned?

1164
01:05:11,292 --> 01:05:12,874
- He said he was going to be
at the finish.

1165
01:05:13,167 --> 01:05:14,416
- Oui.

1166
01:05:14,709 --> 01:05:16,749
Mademoiselle, you
and your mother will be there?

1167
01:05:17,042 --> 01:05:19,791
- Yes.

1168
01:05:20,084 --> 01:05:22,083
- Hastings and I also.

1169
01:05:22,375 --> 01:05:23,624
Fear not, Mademoiselle.

1170
01:05:23,917 --> 01:05:25,541
All will be well.

1171
01:05:25,834 --> 01:05:27,874
- Thank you, Mr. Poirot.

1172
01:05:28,167 --> 01:05:29,666
Thank you.

1173
01:05:35,459 --> 01:05:37,624
I wonder if she knows

1174
01:05:37,917 --> 01:05:40,916
about her mother's
true identity.

1175
01:05:41,209 --> 01:05:44,208
- Ah, she was but nine years
of age at the time, Hastings.

1176
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:48,333
It is possible that the truth,
it has been shielded from her.

1177
01:05:48,625 --> 01:05:50,458
- Well, she's certainly in love
with Jack Renauld.

1178
01:05:50,750 --> 01:05:53,249
You should have seen them,
Poirot.

1179
01:05:53,542 --> 01:05:54,833
- Comment, mon ami?

1180
01:05:55,125 --> 01:05:56,208
- I heard them together.

1181
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:59,916
Over the same garden wall,
as a matter of fact.

1182
01:06:00,209 --> 01:06:02,166
- Hastings, you did not
mention this to me.

1183
01:06:02,459 --> 01:06:04,083
- Didn't I?

1184
01:06:04,375 --> 01:06:05,791
Well...

1185
01:06:06,084 --> 01:06:07,874
- Do you not see of it
the significance?

1186
01:06:08,167 --> 01:06:11,208
- Oh, you think Paul Renauld
could have overheard them too?

1187
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:12,916
- No, no, mon ami.

1188
01:06:13,209 --> 01:06:15,958
I think the exact opposite.

1189
01:06:46,042 --> 01:06:46,916
- Bonjour, mademoiselle.

1190
01:06:47,209 --> 01:06:48,291
- Monsieur Poirot.

1191
01:06:48,584 --> 01:06:49,708
- Mademoiselle, if you please,

1192
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,666
I wish to see the room
of Monsieur Jack Renauld.

1193
01:06:51,959 --> 01:06:53,208
- I'm sorry, sir,

1194
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:54,958
but Monsieur Renauld
is not here.

1195
01:06:55,250 --> 01:06:56,333
- Mademoiselle Leonie,

1196
01:06:56,625 --> 01:06:57,749
I am perhaps all that stands

1197
01:06:58,042 --> 01:06:59,999
between your master
and the guillotine.

1198
01:07:00,292 --> 01:07:03,458
His life, it is in your hands.

1199
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:11,708
- There.
See him there?

1200
01:07:35,834 --> 01:07:39,916
- À vos marques, prêt...

1201
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,374
- Bonne chance.

1202
01:07:52,084 --> 01:07:53,541
- First his coat,
now his shoes.

1203
01:07:53,834 --> 01:07:55,249
What do you expect him to find?

1204
01:07:55,542 --> 01:07:56,833
- You remember
the two footprints

1205
01:07:57,125 --> 01:07:58,499
that were inside the grave,
Hastings?

1206
01:07:58,792 --> 01:08:00,624
- Yes.

1207
01:08:00,917 --> 01:08:03,041
- Voilá.

1208
01:08:03,334 --> 01:08:05,541
- So Jack was there?
- Oui, mon ami.

1209
01:08:05,834 --> 01:08:07,416
And I have no doubt
that these would match

1210
01:08:07,709 --> 01:08:09,333
the cast in the office
of Monsieur Bex.

1211
01:08:09,625 --> 01:08:12,541
- I thought you were trying to
save him, not incriminate him.

1212
01:08:12,834 --> 01:08:15,416
- I'm trying to comprehend him,
Hastings.

1213
01:08:15,709 --> 01:08:17,499
- Well, I don't understand.

1214
01:08:23,125 --> 01:08:25,499
- Hastings?

1215
01:08:25,792 --> 01:08:27,041
You know this girl, Hastings?

1216
01:08:27,334 --> 01:08:29,999
- No, no.
I've never seen her before.

1217
01:08:35,917 --> 01:08:37,124
- There is only the signature.

1218
01:08:37,417 --> 01:08:38,874
"Bella Duveen."

1219
01:08:39,167 --> 01:08:41,499
- Bella?

1220
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:22,791
- Pardon.
Pardon.

1221
01:09:23,084 --> 01:09:24,166
Pardon, madame.

1222
01:09:26,625 --> 01:09:27,874
- Poirot.

1223
01:09:34,959 --> 01:09:35,916
- Madame Renauld.

1224
01:09:36,209 --> 01:09:37,166
- Monsieur Poirot.

1225
01:09:37,459 --> 01:09:38,374
- Where are the cyclists?

1226
01:09:38,667 --> 01:09:40,666
- They should be here
any moment.

1227
01:09:40,959 --> 01:09:42,791
- No sign of Giraud.

1228
01:09:43,084 --> 01:09:43,958
- Why are you here?

1229
01:09:44,250 --> 01:09:46,333
- To speak with your son.

1230
01:10:31,917 --> 01:10:34,916
- Third place
and a record time.

1231
01:10:35,209 --> 01:10:36,333
- Congratulations, monsieur.

1232
01:10:36,625 --> 01:10:38,791
Monsieur Renauld,
there are certain questions

1233
01:10:39,084 --> 01:10:41,416
I must ask you concerning
your late stepfather.

1234
01:10:41,709 --> 01:10:43,041
- What?
Here? Now?

1235
01:10:43,334 --> 01:10:44,499
- Yes, here and now.

1236
01:10:44,792 --> 01:10:47,791
Why did you return to Deauville
on the night of his death?

1237
01:10:48,084 --> 01:10:49,291
- I told you.

1238
01:10:49,584 --> 01:10:51,999
- The truth, monsieur!

1239
01:10:52,292 --> 01:10:53,999
- I wanted to see someone.

1240
01:10:54,292 --> 01:10:55,208
- Marthe Daubreuil.

1241
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:58,083
- Yes.
- And did you see her?

1242
01:10:58,375 --> 01:10:59,999
- No.
- Why not?

1243
01:11:00,292 --> 01:11:01,208
- Out of the way!

1244
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:03,249
Move!

1245
01:11:03,542 --> 01:11:05,666
Jack Renauld,
I'm arresting you

1246
01:11:05,959 --> 01:11:07,333
for the murder
of your stepfather.

1247
01:11:07,625 --> 01:11:08,833
- What?

1248
01:11:09,125 --> 01:11:11,541
- And also for the murder
of your unnamed accomplice.

1249
01:11:11,834 --> 01:11:12,666
Take him.

1250
01:11:12,959 --> 01:11:14,666
- Giraud, you've got it
all wrong.

1251
01:11:14,959 --> 01:11:17,166
- Giraud is never wrong.

1252
01:11:17,459 --> 01:11:19,083
Tell me, Monsieur Renauld,

1253
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:21,708
do you deny it?

1254
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,041
- Tell him, Jack.

1255
01:11:26,334 --> 01:11:29,833
- No, Monsieur Giraud,
I have nothing to say.

1256
01:11:30,125 --> 01:11:31,333
- You see?

1257
01:11:35,375 --> 01:11:38,458
You'd come here to arrest him
yourself, hadn't you, Poirot?

1258
01:11:40,417 --> 01:11:44,166
Well, I beat you...

1259
01:11:44,459 --> 01:11:46,374
by a whisker.

1260
01:12:33,042 --> 01:12:34,041
- Bonjour, Monsieur Stonor.

1261
01:12:34,334 --> 01:12:37,291
If you please, we wish to speak
to Madame Renauld.

1262
01:12:37,584 --> 01:12:39,999
- Come in.
- Merci.

1263
01:12:45,250 --> 01:12:48,041
Madame Renauld,

1264
01:12:48,334 --> 01:12:51,583
I am here in the interest
of your son, Jack Renauld.

1265
01:12:51,875 --> 01:12:53,833
- Is there anything
you can do for him?

1266
01:12:54,125 --> 01:12:55,124
- Mais oui.

1267
01:12:55,417 --> 01:12:57,041
But in order to help him,
the events of the night

1268
01:12:57,334 --> 01:12:59,583
that his stepfather died
must come to light.

1269
01:13:01,042 --> 01:13:02,874
- Of course.

1270
01:13:03,167 --> 01:13:04,833
- All of them.

1271
01:13:10,709 --> 01:13:12,249
Very well.

1272
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,833
The real name of your husband,
madame,

1273
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:17,833
was not Paul Renauld,

1274
01:13:18,125 --> 01:13:19,833
but George Connor,

1275
01:13:20,125 --> 01:13:23,374
was it not?

1276
01:13:23,667 --> 01:13:24,583
- Yes.

1277
01:13:24,875 --> 01:13:26,291
- You mean the man
wanted ten years ago

1278
01:13:26,584 --> 01:13:28,916
for the murder
of Arnold Beroldy?

1279
01:13:29,209 --> 01:13:30,249
- My God.

1280
01:13:30,542 --> 01:13:31,999
- And you met him
after he has escaped

1281
01:13:32,292 --> 01:13:35,958
from England
to South America?

1282
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:37,624
- Yes.

1283
01:13:37,917 --> 01:13:39,958
But you must believe me,
Monsieur Poirot,

1284
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:42,624
he wasn't a bad man.

1285
01:13:42,917 --> 01:13:44,541
That woman used him.

1286
01:13:44,834 --> 01:13:47,749
- Jean Beroldy.

1287
01:13:48,042 --> 01:13:52,208
- Madame Daubreuil,
as she calls herself now.

1288
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:56,333
Ten years ago, she told Paul
that she was in love with him.

1289
01:13:56,625 --> 01:13:59,166
But it was all a lie.

1290
01:13:59,459 --> 01:14:00,874
She wanted her husband's money,

1291
01:14:01,167 --> 01:14:03,458
and she used Paul to get it.

1292
01:14:03,750 --> 01:14:07,166
- And she persuaded him
to murder her husband?

1293
01:14:07,459 --> 01:14:09,416
- Yes.

1294
01:14:09,709 --> 01:14:11,249
Then she laughed at him,

1295
01:14:11,542 --> 01:14:14,291
told him she wanted nothing more
to do with him.

1296
01:14:14,584 --> 01:14:17,499
And then when the police
discovered the truth,

1297
01:14:17,792 --> 01:14:20,333
she betrayed him.

1298
01:14:20,625 --> 01:14:21,666
- This George Connor,

1299
01:14:21,959 --> 01:14:23,874
he made his fortune in
the business of precious stones

1300
01:14:24,167 --> 01:14:25,499
whilst in Santiago.

1301
01:14:25,792 --> 01:14:28,874
And it was there that he met
you and your son?

1302
01:14:29,167 --> 01:14:30,958
- Yes, Jack worked for him.

1303
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:32,708
That's how we met.

1304
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:36,791
- And you married and came
to live together here?

1305
01:14:37,084 --> 01:14:40,874
- How do you know all this,
Monsieur Poirot?

1306
01:14:41,167 --> 01:14:44,249
- The eyes of Hercule Poirot,
madame,

1307
01:14:44,542 --> 01:14:49,083
they see everything.

1308
01:14:49,375 --> 01:14:51,999
Ten years after his escape
from England,

1309
01:14:52,292 --> 01:14:56,666
George Connor
comes to Deauville.

1310
01:14:56,959 --> 01:14:59,208
He has made for himself
a fortune in Chile,

1311
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:00,583
and he now uses this money

1312
01:15:00,875 --> 01:15:03,583
to establish himself here
in France.

1313
01:15:05,417 --> 01:15:09,541
But somehow, his old lover,
Jean Beroldy,

1314
01:15:09,834 --> 01:15:11,791
has managed to track him down,

1315
01:15:12,084 --> 01:15:14,291
and now calling herself
Bernadette Daubreuil,

1316
01:15:14,584 --> 01:15:19,083
taunts him by taking
the very house next door.

1317
01:15:19,375 --> 01:15:20,583
The money that she has inherited

1318
01:15:20,875 --> 01:15:22,333
from the murder
of her first husband,

1319
01:15:22,625 --> 01:15:24,124
has long ago been spent.

1320
01:15:24,417 --> 01:15:27,083
But she now sees
that her knowledge,

1321
01:15:27,375 --> 01:15:30,166
it can bring her new fortune.

1322
01:15:34,167 --> 01:15:37,624
She uses this to blackmail
Paul Renauld.

1323
01:15:40,375 --> 01:15:42,999
And then,
matters already grave,

1324
01:15:43,292 --> 01:15:45,666
they are made worse.

1325
01:15:45,959 --> 01:15:47,916
Jack Renauld falls in love
with a beautiful girl

1326
01:15:48,209 --> 01:15:50,374
he sees almost daily,
Marthe,

1327
01:15:50,667 --> 01:15:53,666
the daughter of the woman that
Paul Renauld hates and fears.

1328
01:15:53,959 --> 01:15:55,583
Paul observes them together,

1329
01:15:55,875 --> 01:15:59,083
but he is powerless
to prevent the association

1330
01:15:59,375 --> 01:16:03,708
and thinks now only of escape.

1331
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,166
- Yes.

1332
01:16:05,459 --> 01:16:09,083
Paul was being drained
by Madame Daubreuil.

1333
01:16:09,375 --> 01:16:11,541
Every day was a torment to him.

1334
01:16:11,834 --> 01:16:13,374
He had to get away.

1335
01:16:13,667 --> 01:16:15,541
- And the method that worked
for him ten years ago,

1336
01:16:15,834 --> 01:16:17,749
he decides to put to use again.

1337
01:16:18,042 --> 01:16:20,249
- Yes.

1338
01:16:20,542 --> 01:16:22,166
Only this time, it would seem

1339
01:16:22,459 --> 01:16:25,791
that he was the one
the intruders had killed.

1340
01:16:26,084 --> 01:16:27,624
I would move away.

1341
01:16:27,917 --> 01:16:31,333
And later, the two of us
would meet and start again.

1342
01:16:31,625 --> 01:16:32,791
- What about Jack?

1343
01:16:33,084 --> 01:16:34,291
He didn't know?

1344
01:16:34,584 --> 01:16:36,249
- I've never told him
about Paul's past.

1345
01:16:36,542 --> 01:16:38,249
I couldn't.

1346
01:16:40,709 --> 01:16:44,333
- And so the plan, it was made.

1347
01:16:46,667 --> 01:16:51,458
But then a few weeks later...

1348
01:16:51,750 --> 01:16:56,541
a tramp comes
to the Villa Genevieve.

1349
01:16:56,834 --> 01:16:58,208
- That is the way out.
- Money!

1350
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:05,124
- He is violent, abusive,
and dangerously ill.

1351
01:17:05,417 --> 01:17:06,833
They struggle together.

1352
01:17:07,125 --> 01:17:10,583
And the tramp suffers
a seizure that is fatal.

1353
01:17:10,875 --> 01:17:14,166
If it is to be believed
that Paul Renauld is dead,

1354
01:17:14,459 --> 01:17:16,291
then a body,
it has to be found.

1355
01:17:16,584 --> 01:17:17,999
And now, as if by providence,

1356
01:17:18,292 --> 01:17:21,499
a body, it has been sent
in the form of the tramp.

1357
01:17:23,459 --> 01:17:26,624
Paul dresses the tramp
with a suit of his own clothes.

1358
01:17:26,917 --> 01:17:28,916
But there is worse.

1359
01:17:29,209 --> 01:17:32,041
To make
this deception convincing,

1360
01:17:32,334 --> 01:17:33,333
the body must look as though

1361
01:17:33,625 --> 01:17:36,208
it has been murdered
most brutally.

1362
01:17:43,750 --> 01:17:47,124
It is a dreadful deed that,
to make a semblance of murder.

1363
01:17:51,125 --> 01:17:53,999
- Sometimes
I wish you were dead.

1364
01:17:54,292 --> 01:17:55,416
- And so to the day itself.

1365
01:17:55,709 --> 01:17:57,083
- For once in my life,
I could do as I...

1366
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:58,958
- Jack, the stepson
of Paul Renauld,

1367
01:17:59,250 --> 01:18:00,416
is sent away to Chile,

1368
01:18:00,709 --> 01:18:02,583
simply to remove him
from the scene.

1369
01:18:02,875 --> 01:18:03,874
In the same manner,

1370
01:18:04,167 --> 01:18:07,166
Laurence, the chauffeur,
is given a holiday.

1371
01:18:07,459 --> 01:18:11,874
And so the preparations,
they are complete.

1372
01:18:12,167 --> 01:18:13,291
But Paul Renauld,

1373
01:18:13,584 --> 01:18:15,124
he uses every opportunity.

1374
01:18:15,417 --> 01:18:17,749
And when he sees me,
Hercule Poirot,

1375
01:18:18,042 --> 01:18:22,624
he decides to draw me
into his plan.

1376
01:18:22,917 --> 01:18:26,041
It is a pretty little charade
that he plays at the hotel.

1377
01:18:26,334 --> 01:18:29,791
He tells to us nothing,
only that there is a fraud,

1378
01:18:30,084 --> 01:18:32,374
and pretends to be afraid.

1379
01:18:32,667 --> 01:18:33,666
But this is all a performance

1380
01:18:33,959 --> 01:18:36,374
designed to give credence
to his plan.

1381
01:18:38,375 --> 01:18:39,499
Night falls,

1382
01:18:39,792 --> 01:18:42,333
and all is in readiness.

1383
01:18:42,625 --> 01:18:45,999
The maid, Leonie,
is sound asleep.

1384
01:18:46,292 --> 01:18:48,499
For the cup of cocoa
that she takes each night,

1385
01:18:48,792 --> 01:18:50,874
it has been drunk.

1386
01:18:54,292 --> 01:18:55,249
And now at last,

1387
01:18:55,542 --> 01:18:57,541
Paul Renauld
puts into action his plan,

1388
01:18:57,834 --> 01:19:00,583
repeating the events
of ten years before.

1389
01:19:03,667 --> 01:19:05,624
He ensures that the ropes,

1390
01:19:05,917 --> 01:19:08,124
they cut into the wrists
of his wife,

1391
01:19:08,417 --> 01:19:10,791
for this time,
there must be no mistake.

1392
01:19:17,875 --> 01:19:21,333
The hour, it is 10:00.

1393
01:19:21,625 --> 01:19:24,833
And not 2:00,
as you later tell me, madame.

1394
01:19:25,125 --> 01:19:26,208
But Paul Renauld
intends to leave

1395
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:27,624
on the last train
from Deauville,

1396
01:19:27,917 --> 01:19:29,916
which leaves at 7 minutes
past 12:00.

1397
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,791
He slips on an overcoat,

1398
01:19:35,084 --> 01:19:37,624
for it is his intention
to make his escape

1399
01:19:37,917 --> 01:19:41,833
dressed in the clothes
of the tramp.

1400
01:19:42,125 --> 01:19:45,374
And then both George Connor
and Paul Renauld

1401
01:19:45,667 --> 01:19:48,749
will once again
no longer exist.

1402
01:19:49,917 --> 01:19:51,499
Paul Renauld
plans to bury the tramp

1403
01:19:51,792 --> 01:19:53,416
where he is bound
to be discovered.

1404
01:19:53,709 --> 01:19:57,583
The new bunker, it is ideal.

1405
01:19:57,875 --> 01:19:59,874
He also has with him
the pipe made of lead

1406
01:20:00,167 --> 01:20:01,791
with which he intends
to disfigure the face

1407
01:20:02,084 --> 01:20:04,083
of the dead man.

1408
01:20:04,375 --> 01:20:06,416
Only then, the justice,

1409
01:20:06,709 --> 01:20:08,124
which he has
for so long eluded,

1410
01:20:08,417 --> 01:20:09,499
overtakes him.

1411
01:20:09,792 --> 01:20:13,208
Fantasy is made reality.

1412
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:17,958
An unknown hand stabs him
in the back.

1413
01:20:18,250 --> 01:20:20,374
- Agh!

1414
01:20:20,667 --> 01:20:23,583
Agh!

1415
01:20:34,375 --> 01:20:36,583
- So someone learned of the plan
to fake his death

1416
01:20:36,875 --> 01:20:38,666
and used it to kill him.

1417
01:20:38,959 --> 01:20:41,499
- Oui, mon ami.

1418
01:20:41,792 --> 01:20:44,749
And...if I may say so, madame,

1419
01:20:45,042 --> 01:20:46,999
when you heard of his death
from Monsieur Bex,

1420
01:20:47,292 --> 01:20:49,291
your performance,
it was superb.

1421
01:20:51,834 --> 01:20:54,291
- But you weren't convinced.

1422
01:20:54,584 --> 01:20:56,416
- No.

1423
01:20:56,709 --> 01:21:00,791
But then when you saw his body
in the mortuary...

1424
01:21:01,084 --> 01:21:03,916
- But it was horrible.

1425
01:21:04,209 --> 01:21:06,999
Horrible.

1426
01:21:07,292 --> 01:21:10,333
It shouldn't have been Paul.

1427
01:21:10,625 --> 01:21:14,499
It shouldn't.

1428
01:21:14,792 --> 01:21:18,041
- You have suffered
an ordeal, madame.

1429
01:21:18,334 --> 01:21:20,041
I salute your courage.

1430
01:21:20,334 --> 01:21:23,666
- My God.

1431
01:21:23,959 --> 01:21:26,749
- You knew nothing of this,
Monsieur Stonor?

1432
01:21:27,042 --> 01:21:29,083
- No, of course not,
nothing at all.

1433
01:21:29,375 --> 01:21:32,041
- You never even suspected
that your employer,

1434
01:21:32,334 --> 01:21:35,249
he was in hiding
from the British authorities?

1435
01:21:35,542 --> 01:21:39,166
- No.
Why should I have?

1436
01:21:39,459 --> 01:21:40,333
- Monsieur Poirot,

1437
01:21:40,625 --> 01:21:45,249
I don't care what happens to me,

1438
01:21:45,542 --> 01:21:47,999
but can you help Jack?

1439
01:21:54,084 --> 01:21:56,041
- Et bien,
the preliminary hearing,

1440
01:21:56,334 --> 01:21:59,083
it is set for tomorrow,
is it not?

1441
01:21:59,375 --> 01:22:00,916
- Yes.

1442
01:22:01,209 --> 01:22:02,291
Giraud is certain

1443
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:04,958
that he'll be committed
for full trial,

1444
01:22:05,250 --> 01:22:07,833
but I know that Jack
had nothing to do

1445
01:22:08,125 --> 01:22:11,416
with his stepfather's death.

1446
01:22:11,709 --> 01:22:15,291
- I, too, know it, madame.

1447
01:22:15,584 --> 01:22:19,208
And it is something,
also, I can prove.

1448
01:22:26,375 --> 01:22:28,499
- How can you prove that Jack
didn't murder Paul Renauld?

1449
01:22:28,792 --> 01:22:30,416
- Et bien,
that is simple, mon ami.

1450
01:22:30,709 --> 01:22:32,166
On that night,
there was a witness,

1451
01:22:32,459 --> 01:22:34,291
a witness who has yet
to come forward.

1452
01:22:34,584 --> 01:22:35,708
- Who?

1453
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,333
- Ah, Hastings,
it is for you a dilemma,

1454
01:22:37,625 --> 01:22:39,124
is it not?

1455
01:22:39,417 --> 01:22:40,333
You search for the truth,

1456
01:22:40,625 --> 01:22:42,416
and yet of it,
you are always afraid.

1457
01:22:42,709 --> 01:22:43,999
- What do you mean?

1458
01:22:44,292 --> 01:22:47,416
- I speak of Mademoiselle
Bella Duveen, mon ami.

1459
01:22:47,709 --> 01:22:49,374
You can protect her no longer.

1460
01:22:49,667 --> 01:22:52,333
I must speak with her at once.

1461
01:22:52,625 --> 01:22:55,374
- Her name isn't Bella.
It's Isabelle.

1462
01:22:55,667 --> 01:22:57,249
- Isabelle to you, mon ami,

1463
01:22:57,542 --> 01:22:59,624
but Bella Duveen
to Jack Renauld.

1464
01:22:59,917 --> 01:23:01,791
Remember the B.D.
that we found in the letter?

1465
01:23:02,084 --> 01:23:03,791
- That letter was written
to Paul Renauld.

1466
01:23:04,084 --> 01:23:04,874
- No, no, no, Hastings.

1467
01:23:05,125 --> 01:23:06,749
It was addressed
to "my dearest one."

1468
01:23:07,042 --> 01:23:08,374
Why do you assume it was his?

1469
01:23:08,667 --> 01:23:10,416
- It was in his coat pocket.
- Uh-huh.

1470
01:23:10,709 --> 01:23:12,458
It was in the pocket
of the coat he was wearing,

1471
01:23:12,750 --> 01:23:15,749
but that coat,
it was not his.

1472
01:23:16,042 --> 01:23:17,124
Do you not see, Hastings?

1473
01:23:17,417 --> 01:23:18,958
When Jack Renauld,
he left for Cherbourg,

1474
01:23:19,250 --> 01:23:21,249
by accident, he took
the coat of his stepfather.

1475
01:23:21,542 --> 01:23:24,124
- And so that night...
- Exactement.

1476
01:23:24,417 --> 01:23:28,291
Paul Renauld, he was wearing
the coat of his stepson.

1477
01:23:28,584 --> 01:23:31,624
- So Isabelle was in love
with Jack Renauld.

1478
01:23:31,917 --> 01:23:33,166
- Oui.

1479
01:23:36,042 --> 01:23:38,833
Why have you been
torturing yourself, mon ami?

1480
01:23:41,792 --> 01:23:42,958
The photograph
you have not seen,

1481
01:23:43,250 --> 01:23:45,208
the name you do not know,

1482
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:48,249
why must you protect this girl?

1483
01:23:48,542 --> 01:23:51,291
- I don't know,
I...

1484
01:23:51,584 --> 01:23:54,124
I suppose
I've fallen in love with her.

1485
01:23:56,042 --> 01:23:57,041
- Ah.

1486
01:23:57,334 --> 01:23:59,416
Then for you, mon ami,

1487
01:23:59,709 --> 01:24:01,833
I am most sad.

1488
01:24:04,917 --> 01:24:06,083
Bonjour, madame.

1489
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:08,708
Mademoiselle Bella Duveen,
s'il vous plaît.

1490
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:12,624
- Miss Duveen,
why do you want her?

1491
01:24:12,917 --> 01:24:15,708
- She is required most urgently
in a court of law, madame.

1492
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,458
It is her testimony
that would establish

1493
01:24:17,750 --> 01:24:18,958
the innocence of a young man.

1494
01:24:19,250 --> 01:24:21,124
- Well, I'm sorry.
She's not here.

1495
01:24:21,417 --> 01:24:22,416
- What?

1496
01:24:22,709 --> 01:24:25,083
- She went out yesterday
and did not return.

1497
01:24:25,375 --> 01:24:27,124
- Oh.

1498
01:24:37,167 --> 01:24:40,374
- Ah, Poirot,

1499
01:24:40,667 --> 01:24:44,249
there's something you owe me,
I think.

1500
01:24:44,542 --> 01:24:46,708
- The game is not over yet,
Monsieur Giraud.

1501
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,208
- No?

1502
01:24:50,042 --> 01:24:51,124
- No.

1503
01:24:51,417 --> 01:24:53,249
The judge has still
to make his recommendations.

1504
01:24:53,542 --> 01:24:56,249
- Hanging on to the bitter end,
eh, Poirot?

1505
01:24:56,542 --> 01:25:00,166
Well, I can wait.

1506
01:25:16,250 --> 01:25:18,374
- I've examined the papers
set before me

1507
01:25:18,667 --> 01:25:21,541
by lawyers
for the prosecution and defense,

1508
01:25:21,834 --> 01:25:24,833
and I have just a few questions
I wish to ask.

1509
01:25:25,125 --> 01:25:27,083
Monsieur Renauld,

1510
01:25:27,375 --> 01:25:29,416
do you deny that you were
in Deauville

1511
01:25:29,709 --> 01:25:31,458
on the night of the crime?

1512
01:25:33,125 --> 01:25:35,333
- No, I was here.

1513
01:25:35,625 --> 01:25:39,624
- And did you say to
your stepfather that same day,

1514
01:25:39,917 --> 01:25:41,124
"I wish you were dead;

1515
01:25:41,417 --> 01:25:42,666
Then I could do as I please"?

1516
01:25:42,959 --> 01:25:44,833
- Your Honor,
my client has been

1517
01:25:45,125 --> 01:25:46,833
under considerable
nervous strain.

1518
01:25:47,125 --> 01:25:48,624
I wish to place it on record--

1519
01:25:48,917 --> 01:25:50,833
- Yes, yes, Mr. Grosier.

1520
01:25:51,125 --> 01:25:53,583
Do you understand,
Monsieur Renauld,

1521
01:25:53,875 --> 01:25:55,708
that on the answers
you have given me,

1522
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:59,333
I have no alternative
but to commit you for trial?

1523
01:26:03,250 --> 01:26:06,458
- Yes.

1524
01:26:06,750 --> 01:26:08,374
- Very well then.

1525
01:26:12,459 --> 01:26:13,708
- Isabelle.

1526
01:26:17,875 --> 01:26:19,833
- My name is Bella Duveen.

1527
01:26:20,125 --> 01:26:23,749
I wish to give myself up
for the murder of Paul Renauld.

1528
01:26:30,667 --> 01:26:32,249
- You knew about this.

1529
01:26:32,542 --> 01:26:34,208
You tricked me.

1530
01:27:01,209 --> 01:27:02,958
- So, Mr. Poirot,

1531
01:27:03,250 --> 01:27:05,124
we meet at last.

1532
01:27:06,834 --> 01:27:10,124
Isn't that
what I'm meant to say?

1533
01:27:10,417 --> 01:27:11,541
- Mademoiselle Duveen,

1534
01:27:11,834 --> 01:27:13,624
why did you murder
Monsieur Paul Renauld?

1535
01:27:16,250 --> 01:27:17,166
- Why do you think?

1536
01:27:17,459 --> 01:27:18,874
- I think it was
because you were in love

1537
01:27:19,167 --> 01:27:21,583
with his stepson,
Jack Renauld.

1538
01:27:23,209 --> 01:27:24,124
- Yes.

1539
01:27:24,417 --> 01:27:26,541
- But he had left you
for Marthe Daubreuil.

1540
01:27:26,834 --> 01:27:27,791
And it was Jack Renauld

1541
01:27:28,084 --> 01:27:29,541
that you threatened to kill
in your letter.

1542
01:27:29,834 --> 01:27:32,624
- You got the wrong man.

1543
01:27:32,917 --> 01:27:35,124
You thought Paul Renauld
was his stepson.

1544
01:27:35,417 --> 01:27:36,208
It was dark,

1545
01:27:36,459 --> 01:27:38,416
and he was wearing
the wrong coat.

1546
01:27:38,709 --> 01:27:41,958
- I don't want to talk about it.

1547
01:27:44,959 --> 01:27:49,374
- Then tell me,
Mademoiselle Duveen,

1548
01:27:49,667 --> 01:27:50,749
why did you take the knife

1549
01:27:51,042 --> 01:27:53,416
from the office
of Monsieur Bex?

1550
01:27:54,959 --> 01:27:56,291
- To protect myself.

1551
01:27:56,584 --> 01:27:58,541
- And this knife, it was yours?

1552
01:28:00,834 --> 01:28:02,458
- Yes.

1553
01:28:10,292 --> 01:28:12,249
- Merci, Mademoiselle Duveen.

1554
01:28:18,084 --> 01:28:19,374
- Poirot.

1555
01:28:28,209 --> 01:28:30,166
- I shall be outside.

1556
01:28:48,209 --> 01:28:49,833
I owe you an apology.

1557
01:28:50,125 --> 01:28:51,291
- No.

1558
01:28:51,584 --> 01:28:54,124
- Yes.

1559
01:28:54,417 --> 01:28:56,916
I saw you at your hotel.

1560
01:28:57,209 --> 01:28:59,458
- You recognized Poirot.

1561
01:29:01,084 --> 01:29:03,083
- Yes.

1562
01:29:03,375 --> 01:29:06,083
That's when I decided
to use you,

1563
01:29:06,375 --> 01:29:09,333
to find out what you knew.

1564
01:29:09,625 --> 01:29:12,374
But the things I said, Arthur,

1565
01:29:12,667 --> 01:29:14,749
I wasn’t just pretending.

1566
01:29:19,042 --> 01:29:20,749
- You said you were in love
with Jack Renauld.

1567
01:29:21,042 --> 01:29:24,333
- I was once.

1568
01:29:24,625 --> 01:29:25,874
- And now?

1569
01:29:33,125 --> 01:29:36,208
- Just forget about me, Arthur.

1570
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:39,666
You're a kind man.

1571
01:29:39,959 --> 01:29:42,666
If only we had met before,

1572
01:29:42,959 --> 01:29:44,541
maybe...

1573
01:29:53,875 --> 01:29:55,083
- Ladies and gentlemen,

1574
01:29:55,375 --> 01:29:57,374
I'd like to propose a toast

1575
01:29:57,667 --> 01:30:00,249
to...freedom.

1576
01:30:02,417 --> 01:30:04,333
Freedom.

1577
01:30:10,042 --> 01:30:10,958
- And to us, Jack.

1578
01:30:11,250 --> 01:30:12,874
- To a new life together.

1579
01:30:22,417 --> 01:30:24,333
- The wedding, it is to be soon,
Monsieur Renauld?

1580
01:30:24,625 --> 01:30:26,291
- Ah, yes.

1581
01:30:26,584 --> 01:30:28,833
I want to put this
very much behind us.

1582
01:30:29,125 --> 01:30:30,833
- Start again.

1583
01:30:31,125 --> 01:30:33,708
- Bella, I treated
her shamefully, Mr. Poirot.

1584
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,333
- At least that awful Giraud
lost his wager with you,

1585
01:30:36,625 --> 01:30:37,874
Monsieur Poirot.

1586
01:30:38,167 --> 01:30:40,999
- Oui, but it is a wager
that Poirot has yet to win--

1587
01:30:41,292 --> 01:30:42,416
- Out of my way.
Let me through.

1588
01:30:47,042 --> 01:30:48,374
How can you, Jack?

1589
01:30:48,667 --> 01:30:50,374
How can you celebrate?

1590
01:30:50,667 --> 01:30:51,458
- Mother.

1591
01:30:51,750 --> 01:30:53,249
- You may be free,

1592
01:30:53,542 --> 01:30:55,666
but Paul's death
is on your hands.

1593
01:30:55,959 --> 01:30:56,958
- That's not fair.

1594
01:30:57,250 --> 01:30:59,124
- Sit down, Mother.
- No, Jack.

1595
01:30:59,417 --> 01:31:01,166
You never understood him.

1596
01:31:01,459 --> 01:31:04,124
You defied him,
mistrusted him.

1597
01:31:04,417 --> 01:31:06,874
And by your heartless treatment
of another woman,

1598
01:31:07,167 --> 01:31:08,708
you killed him.

1599
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,208
- I didn't.

1600
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:12,499
- Well, you'll never have
his money.

1601
01:31:12,792 --> 01:31:17,041
Tomorrow I intend to take steps
to disinherit you...

1602
01:31:17,334 --> 01:31:19,791
and that girl.

1603
01:31:20,084 --> 01:31:23,041
- Mother--
- You're no son of mine.

1604
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,958
Take me home, Leonie.

1605
01:31:38,042 --> 01:31:41,083
- Jack, she...
didn't know what she was saying.

1606
01:31:42,834 --> 01:31:44,124
- She did.

1607
01:31:49,084 --> 01:31:52,458
- Jack, darling,

1608
01:31:52,750 --> 01:31:54,749
you can stay with us tonight.

1609
01:31:55,042 --> 01:31:57,916
- Yes, I think
that would be best.

1610
01:32:10,209 --> 01:32:11,416
- Poirot, I wish
you'd explain to me

1611
01:32:11,709 --> 01:32:12,833
what we're doing here.

1612
01:32:13,125 --> 01:32:14,333
- We're watching the house,
mon ami.

1613
01:32:14,625 --> 01:32:15,541
- Well, I know that,
but why?

1614
01:32:15,834 --> 01:32:17,166
There's only Madame Renauld
in there.

1615
01:32:17,459 --> 01:32:18,249
- Shh.

1616
01:32:26,584 --> 01:32:27,708
- Who is that?

1617
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,791
- It's the true killer
of Monsieur Paul Renauld.

1618
01:32:30,084 --> 01:32:31,708
- What?
But Isabelle--

1619
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,124
- No, no, no, Hastings,

1620
01:32:33,417 --> 01:32:36,416
Bella Duveen was not the killer
of Paul Renauld.

1621
01:32:36,709 --> 01:32:37,916
- Well, then who was?

1622
01:32:41,459 --> 01:32:44,708
The gun, it was not
according to my plan.

1623
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:46,708
Allons-y vite.

1624
01:32:51,084 --> 01:32:52,291
This way, Hastings.

1625
01:32:52,584 --> 01:32:55,249
The bedroom of Madame Renauld.
C'est près ici.

1626
01:33:05,667 --> 01:33:09,249
- She came just as you said
she would, Monsieur Poirot.

1627
01:33:09,542 --> 01:33:11,333
She tried to smother me.

1628
01:33:11,625 --> 01:33:14,541
- I was waiting just like
you told me to, but...

1629
01:33:14,834 --> 01:33:16,374
when she saw me,
she took out a gun.

1630
01:33:16,667 --> 01:33:19,333
There was a struggle,
and it went off.

1631
01:33:19,625 --> 01:33:21,291
I'm afraid she's dead.

1632
01:33:34,667 --> 01:33:36,833
- Who is it, Poirot?

1633
01:33:37,125 --> 01:33:39,583
- The true killer
of Paul Renauld, mon ami.

1634
01:33:46,709 --> 01:33:48,458
Marthe Daubreuil.

1635
01:33:54,042 --> 01:33:56,708
- No, you cannot arrest me.
I have done nothing.

1636
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,249
- Madame Daubreuil,
you are being held

1637
01:33:58,542 --> 01:33:59,833
as an accomplice to murder.

1638
01:34:00,125 --> 01:34:01,041
- No!

1639
01:34:01,334 --> 01:34:04,499
I need to speak to Marthe.
Where's Marthe?

1640
01:34:04,792 --> 01:34:06,041
- Poirot.

1641
01:34:14,542 --> 01:34:15,999
- This crime...

1642
01:34:16,292 --> 01:34:18,958
Ah, yes.
Merci beaucoup.

1643
01:34:19,250 --> 01:34:21,166
It has indeed challenged
the little gray cells

1644
01:34:21,459 --> 01:34:23,666
of Hercule Poirot
to the extreme.

1645
01:34:25,834 --> 01:34:26,833
And yet from the start,

1646
01:34:27,125 --> 01:34:29,374
I knew that this was a crime
of the cold blood.

1647
01:34:29,667 --> 01:34:31,624
And so it was.

1648
01:34:31,917 --> 01:34:33,708
Marthe Daubreuil
knew of the plans

1649
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,583
of Monsieur Paul Renauld
to create his fake death.

1650
01:34:36,875 --> 01:34:39,249
And with great cunning,
she set out to use those plans

1651
01:34:39,542 --> 01:34:41,458
for the purposes of her own.

1652
01:34:41,750 --> 01:34:43,999
- But, Monsieur Poirot,
how could she have known?

1653
01:34:44,292 --> 01:34:46,041
We told no one.

1654
01:34:46,334 --> 01:34:48,124
- So you believe, madame.

1655
01:34:48,417 --> 01:34:49,791
But when you made the plans,

1656
01:34:50,084 --> 01:34:53,166
it was by the garden wall,
was it not?

1657
01:34:53,459 --> 01:34:54,666
- Yes.

1658
01:34:54,959 --> 01:34:58,541
Paul and I,
we did talk there.

1659
01:34:58,834 --> 01:35:01,708
- I'll dig the grave at 10:00.

1660
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,749
I'll be on the train
out of here

1661
01:35:04,042 --> 01:35:05,708
7 minutes past 12:00.

1662
01:35:08,375 --> 01:35:10,958
You'll have to identify
the body.

1663
01:35:11,250 --> 01:35:13,374
It won't be pleasant,

1664
01:35:13,667 --> 01:35:15,166
but you'll have to be
convincing.

1665
01:35:15,459 --> 01:35:16,749
- I'll do my best.

1666
01:35:17,042 --> 01:35:18,458
If it's really the only way

1667
01:35:18,750 --> 01:35:20,624
to rid you
of Bernadette Daubreuil forever,

1668
01:35:20,917 --> 01:35:21,791
then so be it.

1669
01:35:22,084 --> 01:35:23,583
- And that was
how Marthe Daubreuil,

1670
01:35:23,875 --> 01:35:25,874
she overheard.

1671
01:35:26,167 --> 01:35:29,124
Later, Hastings would hear
Marthe talking with Jack

1672
01:35:29,417 --> 01:35:31,124
over the same wall.

1673
01:35:31,417 --> 01:35:33,124
And that is what alerted me
to the possibility.

1674
01:35:33,417 --> 01:35:35,333
- Paul Renauld will be dead.

1675
01:35:37,042 --> 01:35:38,791
- But why did she do it?

1676
01:35:39,084 --> 01:35:41,624
- Mm.

1677
01:35:41,917 --> 01:35:44,749
Always, it was for money.

1678
01:35:45,042 --> 01:35:46,458
Monsieur Paul Renauld
planned to escape

1679
01:35:46,750 --> 01:35:48,041
from the blackmail
of Madame Daubreuil

1680
01:35:48,334 --> 01:35:50,958
by pretending to be dead.

1681
01:35:51,250 --> 01:35:55,541
But what if he were really dead?
What would happen then?

1682
01:35:55,834 --> 01:35:57,416
- Paul's money would come to me.

1683
01:35:57,709 --> 01:35:59,999
- Exactement.

1684
01:36:00,292 --> 01:36:02,749
But what if,
a short while later,

1685
01:36:03,042 --> 01:36:06,874
you were also to die, madame?

1686
01:36:07,167 --> 01:36:09,041
- Jack would have everything.

1687
01:36:09,334 --> 01:36:11,958
- And Marthe
would have Jack Renauld.

1688
01:36:13,709 --> 01:36:15,291
But this marriage,
it could only take place

1689
01:36:15,584 --> 01:36:17,291
if Paul Renauld
no longer stood in the way.

1690
01:36:17,584 --> 01:36:18,708
Oh, yes, Marthe and her mother

1691
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:20,374
certainly planned
for the long term.

1692
01:36:20,667 --> 01:36:23,458
However, last night,
they discovered

1693
01:36:23,750 --> 01:36:26,874
that Madame Renauld
intended to change her will.

1694
01:36:27,167 --> 01:36:29,624
And that forced them
to act at once.

1695
01:36:29,917 --> 01:36:32,374
- My God, what devils.

1696
01:36:32,667 --> 01:36:34,249
- Oui.

1697
01:36:34,542 --> 01:36:37,374
Alors, Madame Renauld played
the part I suggested to her,

1698
01:36:37,667 --> 01:36:41,166
and that was to force
the hand of Madame Daubreuil.

1699
01:36:45,209 --> 01:36:47,833
- Oh, Bella.

1700
01:36:48,125 --> 01:36:51,499
Will you ever forgive me?

1701
01:36:51,792 --> 01:36:52,999
- Yes, Jack.

1702
01:36:53,292 --> 01:36:54,833
Of course.

1703
01:36:57,667 --> 01:37:00,916
- But this is what I don't
understand, Monsieur Poirot.

1704
01:37:01,209 --> 01:37:03,416
So these two
were protecting each other?

1705
01:37:03,709 --> 01:37:06,124
- Oui, Monsieur Bex.

1706
01:37:06,417 --> 01:37:08,874
Never before have I seen
so many misconceptions.

1707
01:37:09,167 --> 01:37:11,458
And that was because
each thought the other

1708
01:37:11,750 --> 01:37:14,124
guilty of the murder.

1709
01:37:14,417 --> 01:37:17,374
- But why?

1710
01:37:17,667 --> 01:37:19,833
- Let me describe it to you
as I see it.

1711
01:37:23,250 --> 01:37:24,624
On the night of the murder,

1712
01:37:24,917 --> 01:37:28,208
Jack Renauld
returns from Cherbourg.

1713
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:31,291
He plans to visit
Marthe Daubreuil in secrecy,

1714
01:37:31,584 --> 01:37:34,833
but he is seen
by the station master.

1715
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,833
Meanwhile,
Mademoiselle Bella Duveen,

1716
01:37:40,125 --> 01:37:41,999
tortured by her love
for Jack Renauld,

1717
01:37:42,292 --> 01:37:45,958
decides to visit him
one last time to plead with him,

1718
01:37:46,250 --> 01:37:50,666
unaware that he is supposed
to have departed for Santiago.

1719
01:37:50,959 --> 01:37:55,708
Her route, it will take her
across the golf links.

1720
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,291
In the meantime,

1721
01:37:58,584 --> 01:38:02,208
Monsieur Paul Renauld
has completed his task

1722
01:38:02,500 --> 01:38:04,666
and is now ready to recover
the body of the tramp,

1723
01:38:04,959 --> 01:38:06,416
which lies nearby in the shed

1724
01:38:06,709 --> 01:38:09,958
with a knife he has placed
in the chest.

1725
01:38:10,250 --> 01:38:13,291
He plans, of course,
to bury the tramp in the grave.

1726
01:38:13,584 --> 01:38:16,249
And that is when
Marthe Daubreuil strikes.

1727
01:38:16,542 --> 01:38:19,249
- Agh!

1728
01:38:19,542 --> 01:38:21,499
Agh!

1729
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:31,749
- However, at this moment,
a figure approaches.

1730
01:38:32,042 --> 01:38:36,166
Marthe Daubreuil
flees from the scene.

1731
01:38:36,459 --> 01:38:37,833
The route
of Monsieur Jack Renauld,

1732
01:38:38,125 --> 01:38:40,958
it has taken him also
across the golf links

1733
01:38:41,250 --> 01:38:44,624
where he makes a discovery
most terrible,

1734
01:38:44,917 --> 01:38:47,374
the body of his stepfather.

1735
01:38:47,667 --> 01:38:49,624
Can it be true?

1736
01:38:49,917 --> 01:38:53,833
He climbs into the grave...

1737
01:38:54,125 --> 01:38:56,499
just as Mademoiselle
Bella Duveen arrives,

1738
01:38:56,792 --> 01:38:59,749
cutting her hand and tearing
her sleeve on some sharp briars,

1739
01:39:00,042 --> 01:39:01,458
which are near to the site
of the new bunker.

1740
01:39:04,667 --> 01:39:08,083
- And so to the moment of truth.

1741
01:39:08,375 --> 01:39:12,291
Jack Renauld looks up,
and what does he see?

1742
01:39:12,584 --> 01:39:15,166
Mademoiselle Bella Duveen
with blood on her clothes.

1743
01:39:15,459 --> 01:39:16,833
It must be the blood
of his stepfather.

1744
01:39:17,125 --> 01:39:18,333
Of that, he is sure.

1745
01:39:18,625 --> 01:39:22,124
She has mistaken the coat
and has killed a wrong man.

1746
01:39:22,417 --> 01:39:23,791
And Mademoiselle Bella Duveen,

1747
01:39:24,084 --> 01:39:25,624
she sees Jack Renauld
in the grave

1748
01:39:25,917 --> 01:39:27,374
with the body of his stepfather.

1749
01:39:28,875 --> 01:39:31,499
- What is she to believe?

1750
01:39:31,792 --> 01:39:33,833
And from that moment,

1751
01:39:34,125 --> 01:39:37,791
each thought the other
the perpetrator of the crime.

1752
01:39:40,167 --> 01:39:42,291
And that, Monsieur Bex,

1753
01:39:42,584 --> 01:39:45,791
is why they were protecting
each other.

1754
01:39:46,084 --> 01:39:48,083
- It's true.
That's how it happened.

1755
01:39:50,459 --> 01:39:52,374
- But what about the knife?

1756
01:39:52,667 --> 01:39:56,041
Why take the knife
from my office?

1757
01:39:56,334 --> 01:39:59,333
- Mademoiselle?

1758
01:39:59,625 --> 01:40:01,958
- I thought it was Jack's.

1759
01:40:02,250 --> 01:40:05,083
You see, he had given me one
that was exactly the same.

1760
01:40:05,375 --> 01:40:07,499
- It's true.

1761
01:40:07,792 --> 01:40:10,749
I had them made when
I was working for my stepfather.

1762
01:40:11,042 --> 01:40:12,708
The sapphires
were from Santiago.

1763
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:14,999
They were souvenirs
of my time there.

1764
01:40:15,292 --> 01:40:16,124
- Exactement.

1765
01:40:16,417 --> 01:40:17,333
But, Monsieur Renauld,

1766
01:40:17,625 --> 01:40:19,624
there were more than two knives,
were there not?

1767
01:40:23,459 --> 01:40:24,874
Oh, yes.

1768
01:40:25,167 --> 01:40:28,208
Three sapphires

1769
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:30,333
and three knives.

1770
01:40:34,209 --> 01:40:38,999
The first knife
you gave to your mother.

1771
01:40:39,292 --> 01:40:44,166
This was the knife that was used
by Paul Renauld

1772
01:40:44,459 --> 01:40:47,249
by plunging it in the chest
of the dead tramp.

1773
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,958
The second knife you gave
to Mademoiselle Bella Duveen.

1774
01:40:55,250 --> 01:40:57,249
But this knife,
it played no part

1775
01:40:57,542 --> 01:41:00,416
in the events that followed,

1776
01:41:00,709 --> 01:41:02,458
because it was the third knife

1777
01:41:02,750 --> 01:41:04,124
that Mademoiselle Bella Duveen

1778
01:41:04,417 --> 01:41:06,958
took from the office
of Monsieur Bex,

1779
01:41:07,250 --> 01:41:10,916
this was the knife that was used
to kill Monsieur Paul Renauld.

1780
01:41:13,459 --> 01:41:15,749
Tell me, Monsieur Jack,

1781
01:41:16,042 --> 01:41:17,083
this third knife,

1782
01:41:17,375 --> 01:41:18,791
to whom did it belong?

1783
01:41:22,209 --> 01:41:24,666
- I gave the third knife
to Marthe Daubreuil.

1784
01:41:24,959 --> 01:41:28,249
Mm.

1785
01:41:28,542 --> 01:41:30,208
Excuse me.

1786
01:41:39,750 --> 01:41:40,874
Entrez.

1787
01:41:47,334 --> 01:41:49,833
- Monsieur Poirot.

1788
01:41:50,125 --> 01:41:51,083
- Monsieur Giraud.

1789
01:41:51,375 --> 01:41:54,166
- This is yours, I think.

1790
01:42:07,209 --> 01:42:08,333
- No, monsieur.

1791
01:42:11,459 --> 01:42:12,999
You may keep your pipe.

1792
01:42:13,292 --> 01:42:14,291
But from this moment,

1793
01:42:14,584 --> 01:42:16,833
each time that you light it,

1794
01:42:17,125 --> 01:42:19,874
you will think
of Hercule Poirot.

1795
01:42:22,084 --> 01:42:23,666
Yes.

1796
01:42:23,959 --> 01:42:25,916
I will.

1797
01:42:46,459 --> 01:42:47,583
- Actually, Poirot,

1798
01:42:47,875 --> 01:42:49,708
I thought I might stay out here
a little while longer.

1799
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:51,083
- But of course, Hastings.

1800
01:42:51,375 --> 01:42:53,166
You wish to improve
your disability on the links.

1801
01:42:53,459 --> 01:42:54,499
- What?
Oh, my handicap.

1802
01:42:54,792 --> 01:42:55,874
No, no, no.
It's not that.

1803
01:42:56,167 --> 01:42:59,208
I-I just don't feel ready
to come home yet.

1804
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:03,708
- Ah, you speak
of Mademoiselle Duveen.

1805
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,791
- A girl who could do
what she did for Jack Renauld,

1806
01:43:07,084 --> 01:43:08,916
she must really love him.

1807
01:43:11,125 --> 01:43:12,416
- And yet, Hastings,
there are men

1808
01:43:12,709 --> 01:43:15,916
who do not deserve
such love from a woman.

1809
01:43:16,209 --> 01:43:18,458
Well, then...

1810
01:43:18,750 --> 01:43:21,249
return home only
when you are ready, mon ami.

1811
01:43:21,542 --> 01:43:24,583
Until then,
au revoir.

1812
01:43:26,209 --> 01:43:27,916
Merci.
- Au revoir, monsieur.

1813
01:43:28,209 --> 01:43:29,833
Merci.

1814
01:43:49,042 --> 01:43:50,416
- If you please, monsieur,

1815
01:43:50,709 --> 01:43:52,541
I wish to make
the little detour.

1816
01:43:52,834 --> 01:43:54,624
- Bien, monsieur.

1817
01:45:12,625 --> 01:45:14,124
- Arthur.

1818
01:45:16,209 --> 01:45:18,333
- Isabelle.
