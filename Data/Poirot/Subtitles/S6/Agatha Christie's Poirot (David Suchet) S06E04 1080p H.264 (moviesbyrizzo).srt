1
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,624
- Be quiet, Bob.

2
00:03:53,417 --> 00:03:56,749
- Wretched creature.
Games at all hours.

3
00:03:57,042 --> 00:04:02,416
Put him in his basket
before he wakes the whole house.

4
00:04:26,209 --> 00:04:27,499
- Put it there.

5
00:04:27,792 --> 00:04:30,791
Non, non, non, non!
Monsieur, c'est ma valise!

6
00:04:31,084 --> 00:04:33,041
She and I have traveled
together the world.

7
00:04:33,334 --> 00:04:34,624
- Accident, I think, Poirot.

8
00:04:34,917 --> 00:04:36,124
- No, Hastings,
it is a lack of care.

9
00:04:36,417 --> 00:04:38,041
I will not see an old friend
used so roughly.

10
00:04:38,334 --> 00:04:39,749
Put that there.

11
00:04:40,042 --> 00:04:41,624
You see, Hastings, there's just
no pride in the work.

12
00:04:41,917 --> 00:04:43,208
- Look, Poirot,
if we don't buck up,

13
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,583
we're gonna miss Charlie's
attempt at the world record.

14
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:48,791
- Alors, vite, mon ami.
Vite.

15
00:05:06,792 --> 00:05:07,749
- You see?

16
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:12,249
You tick off the porter,
and we miss the boat.

17
00:05:12,542 --> 00:05:17,041
- Do not blame yourself,
Hastings.

18
00:05:17,334 --> 00:05:19,791
- Oh, no.
Now what are we going to do?

19
00:05:20,084 --> 00:05:22,541
Charlie starts in half an hour.

20
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:27,458
- All is not lost, mon ami.

21
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,124
Excusez-moi, monsieur.
This is an emergency.

22
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:33,416
We are foreign observers
at the record attempt.

23
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:36,583
If you please, could you take us
to the Motor Boat Club?

24
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:37,749
Hastings!

25
00:05:41,167 --> 00:05:42,708
- Just think,
in a few minutes time,

26
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,083
old Charlie could become

27
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:46,499
the fastest man in the world
on water.

28
00:05:46,792 --> 00:05:49,833
- And after the record,
it has been broken,

29
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:51,458
a few days for us, Hastings,

30
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,374
of the good food, the good wine,
and a little...

31
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,541
Peace.

32
00:05:58,834 --> 00:06:01,374
- Anyway, I knew there was
a mistake with the speedometer

33
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:02,916
when, at 80 miles an hour,

34
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:05,499
this duck flew past me
flying in the same direction.

35
00:06:05,792 --> 00:06:06,624
- Charlie!

36
00:06:06,917 --> 00:06:08,124
- Battler,
my dear old fellow!

37
00:06:08,417 --> 00:06:09,333
I'm so glad
you could make it!

38
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,208
- We thought we were gonna miss
the main event,

39
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,791
but if you're still here...

40
00:06:13,084 --> 00:06:14,791
- That's right, old boy.
They won't go without me.

41
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:16,958
- May I introduce--
- Ah, this must be him.

42
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,874
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're all very honored.

43
00:06:19,167 --> 00:06:21,541
I'd like you to meet
Hercule Poirot.

44
00:06:21,834 --> 00:06:23,916
- Not the Hercule Poirot?

45
00:06:24,209 --> 00:06:25,416
- Are there others,
mademoiselle?

46
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:27,333
- My sister, Theresa.

47
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,124
And this is, um--
oh, to hell with it.

48
00:06:29,417 --> 00:06:31,208
You're bound to meet them
over the weekend anyhow.

49
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,833
- They're just your sort,
Mr. Poirot--

50
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,374
villains, the lot of them.

51
00:06:35,667 --> 00:06:37,958
- I think you'll find
it's nearly time, sir.

52
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,458
- Oh, hell.
Yes.

53
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,458
You all got 15 minutes
to find a ringside seat.

54
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,166
Look after these two,
will you, Theresa?

55
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:44,249
There's a good chap.

56
00:06:44,542 --> 00:06:45,666
- Of course.
Walter?

57
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,583
Would you bring their suitcases
up to the rooms?

58
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,624
- Certainly, madam.

59
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,041
- And here he is,
ladies and gentlemen,

60
00:06:53,334 --> 00:06:56,958
the man we've been waiting for:
Mr. Charles Arundel.

61
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:01,499
Now, as you know, Mr. Arundel
is a local lad.

62
00:07:01,792 --> 00:07:03,708
Indeed, his aunt,
Mrs. Emily Arundel,

63
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,458
put up the money
for this enterprise,

64
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,541
and we're honored to have her
with us today.

65
00:07:11,167 --> 00:07:13,499
- Mr. Poirot, I'd like you
to meet my aunt.

66
00:07:13,792 --> 00:07:16,833
- Hercule Poirot,
Captain Hastings, Emily Arundel.

67
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:18,041
- Enchanté, madame.

68
00:07:18,334 --> 00:07:19,374
- I didn't know my nephew

69
00:07:19,667 --> 00:07:22,624
had any distinguished friends,
Mr. Poirot.

70
00:07:22,917 --> 00:07:25,249
This is Wilhemina Lawson,
by the way, my companion.

71
00:07:25,542 --> 00:07:26,833
- Madame.

72
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:28,916
- I hope they're treating
you well here, Mr. Poirot.

73
00:07:29,209 --> 00:07:30,874
I know the food is meant to be
excellent, but...

74
00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:33,041
The company...

75
00:07:33,334 --> 00:07:34,624
- Well, they are excited,
madame.

76
00:07:34,917 --> 00:07:36,791
And after the world record,
it has been broken,

77
00:07:37,084 --> 00:07:38,041
they will part
and go away.

78
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,499
- Yes, yes, all right,
I know.

79
00:07:40,792 --> 00:07:45,333
He wants me to introduce you.
May I present Bob?

80
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,708
Enchanté.

81
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,791
Would you care to dine with us
tonight, Mr. Poirot?

82
00:07:50,084 --> 00:07:51,249
Just a family dinner.

83
00:07:51,542 --> 00:07:53,416
- Mr. Arundel faces
a daunting task.

84
00:07:53,709 --> 00:07:55,249
He's gonna cross
the measured mile

85
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:57,999
in under 29.58 seconds

86
00:07:58,292 --> 00:08:01,791
to beat the current record
held by Commodore Wood.

87
00:08:02,084 --> 00:08:04,124
However, conditions today
are perfect,

88
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:05,833
and Mr. Arundel
told me himself

89
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:08,291
he's confident that his craft,
the Spirit of Arundel,

90
00:08:08,584 --> 00:08:10,083
is fighting fit
and ready to go.

91
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:11,333
- There she is!

92
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,916
- Oh, there they are!
- Hello, Aunt Emily!

93
00:08:14,209 --> 00:08:15,833
- Hello, children.
Careful.

94
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,458
- Hello.
How are you?

95
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,749
- I'm well.
I'm well.

96
00:08:19,042 --> 00:08:22,416
- My other niece
and her husband, Mr. Poirot.

97
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:24,124
Bella and Jacob Tanios.

98
00:08:24,417 --> 00:08:25,791
Jacob teaches medicine here,

99
00:08:26,084 --> 00:08:28,083
but, sadly,
they're leaving us.

100
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,624
Why is your papa taking you
back to Greece?

101
00:08:30,917 --> 00:08:32,249
I'm gonna miss you.

102
00:08:32,542 --> 00:08:35,583
- Emily, they have closed
my department at the university.

103
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:36,791
- But, Emily--

104
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:38,249
- Is Charles fully prepared,
do we know?

105
00:08:38,542 --> 00:08:39,416
Or is it time for
a wing and a prayer?

106
00:08:39,709 --> 00:08:41,249
- Charles will be
absolutely fine.

107
00:08:41,542 --> 00:08:42,916
He's always had the luck
of the devil.

108
00:08:43,209 --> 00:08:44,833
- Certainly they're
well-acquainted.

109
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,958
- Emily?
- What is it, Minnie?

110
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,666
- It's 2:00, dear.
It's time.

111
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,999
- Oh, give them to me, then.

112
00:08:52,292 --> 00:08:54,374
- Would you care
to see the boat, Mr. Poirot?

113
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:55,708
- Hmm?
- Oh, I certainly would.

114
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,708
- Oh, good.
You too, children, come on.

115
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,666
- Yes, come on!

116
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,041
- When did John Grainger

117
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:03,749
last give you
a thorough checkup, Emily?

118
00:09:04,042 --> 00:09:05,499
- Why?
Do I look ill?

119
00:09:05,792 --> 00:09:06,999
- Far from it.

120
00:09:07,292 --> 00:09:08,458
Which leads me to ask

121
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,749
why you take these
useless liver capsules.

122
00:09:11,042 --> 00:09:13,624
- I think that's
Emily's business, Dr. Tanios.

123
00:09:13,917 --> 00:09:14,958
Not yours.

124
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:18,333
- Pray silence
for the mayor of Keswick.

125
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,624
- Ladies and gentlemen,

126
00:09:20,917 --> 00:09:24,041
I'm sure
you'd all like to join me

127
00:09:24,334 --> 00:09:29,541
in wishing Charles Arundel
the very best

128
00:09:29,834 --> 00:09:31,999
as he prepares
to make his bid

129
00:09:32,292 --> 00:09:35,624
for the world's
water speed record.

130
00:09:35,917 --> 00:09:40,291
- Godspeed, sir.
Godspeed, and good luck.

131
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:46,041
- Here's for the record!

132
00:09:46,334 --> 00:09:49,041
- Break the record,
Uncle Charles!

133
00:09:49,334 --> 00:09:50,291
- We know you can do it!

134
00:09:50,584 --> 00:09:52,791
- We'll never manage it.
- We must try!

135
00:09:53,084 --> 00:09:54,541
- There!
That's him, honey.

136
00:09:54,834 --> 00:09:56,583
- Oh, honey, quick, come on.

137
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:04,124
- Mr. Poirot!
- Mr. Poirot!

138
00:10:04,417 --> 00:10:05,458
- Oh, God.
It's Dotty and Batty.

139
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,208
Take no notice of them,
Mr. Poirot.

140
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,624
- Poirot, you may think
we're odd.

141
00:10:09,917 --> 00:10:11,333
People do, you know?

142
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:12,708
- But we are
the Tripp sisters.

143
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,708
- Oh, now,
that isn't what's odd.

144
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,041
- You must stop that boat.

145
00:10:17,334 --> 00:10:19,666
- I, madame?
Mais pour quoi?

146
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:22,124
- Because something dreadful
is about to happen.

147
00:10:22,417 --> 00:10:24,583
We came as quickly
as we could.

148
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:28,499
We had a message at lunchtime
from the general.

149
00:10:28,792 --> 00:10:31,749
- Aunt Emily's father.
Dead, 30 years or more.

150
00:10:32,042 --> 00:10:34,916
- Not dead, just living
in another place.

151
00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:36,916
He sent us to you.

152
00:10:37,209 --> 00:10:40,249
- But how did you--
he know Poirot was coming here?

153
00:10:40,542 --> 00:10:43,374
- Bush telegraph's superb
in these parts.

154
00:10:43,667 --> 00:10:45,291
- He saw water

155
00:10:45,584 --> 00:10:48,083
and blood leeching into it,

156
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:51,208
out there on the lake.

157
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,499
- A crime?

158
00:10:52,792 --> 00:10:54,208
- A force of darkness.

159
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,249
You've got to stop it.

160
00:10:56,542 --> 00:10:57,999
- But I can do nothing, madame.

161
00:10:58,292 --> 00:11:00,166
It is not in my power.

162
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,874
- He's started his run-up.

163
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:47,333
Charles Arundel
is entering the measured mile

164
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:50,416
now.

165
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:52,541
Five seconds.

166
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:03,833
15 seconds.

167
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,249
- Oh, come on, come on,
come on.

168
00:12:06,542 --> 00:12:07,791
- 20 seconds.

169
00:12:11,917 --> 00:12:13,749
- No, no.
- Oh, my God!

170
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:43,124
- He is safe, mademoiselle.

171
00:12:43,417 --> 00:12:45,916
Your brother, he is safe.

172
00:12:46,209 --> 00:12:47,916
- Until the next time.

173
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:10,583
- Hello, Bob.
Yes, yes, very brave of you.

174
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,083
Now, calm down now.

175
00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:15,166
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

176
00:13:15,459 --> 00:13:16,291
Allow me, Hastings.

177
00:13:16,584 --> 00:13:19,749
Dog, you will sit!

178
00:13:21,917 --> 00:13:23,958
Bon.
You are very clever.

179
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,624
Bon. Merci.

180
00:13:25,917 --> 00:13:26,916
- Good.

181
00:13:27,209 --> 00:13:28,124
- A welcome most warm indeed

182
00:13:28,417 --> 00:13:30,624
from Monsieur Bob,
Madame Wilhemina.

183
00:13:30,917 --> 00:13:35,791
- May I introduce Dr. Grainger,
an old friend of family.

184
00:13:36,084 --> 00:13:38,249
- Monsieur le docteur.
- Good to meet you, Poirot.

185
00:13:38,542 --> 00:13:40,166
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

186
00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:42,541
- Welcome to Littlegreen House,
gentlemen.

187
00:13:42,834 --> 00:13:44,416
- Merci.

188
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:53,208
- Bob would like
to show you something.

189
00:14:03,334 --> 00:14:05,124
- C'est magnifique, ça!

190
00:14:05,417 --> 00:14:07,624
Hastings, what make of dog
is this?

191
00:14:07,917 --> 00:14:08,958
- A fox terrier.

192
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,958
- No, Charles, I will not
give you more money.

193
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,916
That boat has already cost me
a small fortune.

194
00:14:15,209 --> 00:14:16,624
- Now, look here, Aunt Em,

195
00:14:16,917 --> 00:14:18,458
I'd do anything
to keep this project alive,

196
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,333
and I won't allow anybody,
not even you,

197
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:22,708
to stand in my way.

198
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:25,999
Good evening, gentlemen.

199
00:14:26,292 --> 00:14:28,083
A family discussion--
we have them all the time.

200
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:29,958
Oh, and by the way,
if you're in the market

201
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,416
for a burned-out speedboat,

202
00:14:31,709 --> 00:14:33,749
you'll find one
in the boathouse.

203
00:14:34,042 --> 00:14:35,874
- Ah, good evening,
gentlemen.

204
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:38,124
This was supposed to be
a celebration,

205
00:14:38,417 --> 00:14:41,833
but I fear it may prove
more of a wake.

206
00:14:53,917 --> 00:14:55,416
- Non, non,
monsieur le docteur.

207
00:14:55,709 --> 00:14:57,291
It is the hot needle
in the joints,

208
00:14:57,584 --> 00:14:59,583
not the hot coals
within the flesh.

209
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:02,458
Here, between the fingers.
You see?

210
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,041
- Touch of rheumatism,
I should think.

211
00:15:04,334 --> 00:15:05,708
Why not ask your doctor
to look you over?

212
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,041
- No, but if I ask,
he will find,

213
00:15:07,334 --> 00:15:08,583
and suppose
there is nothing there?

214
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:09,666
- Then he won't find.

215
00:15:09,917 --> 00:15:10,833
- But if he does not find,

216
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:13,708
how can I be sure
that he has looked?

217
00:15:15,292 --> 00:15:16,958
- Is it time, Isabel?

218
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,208
Silence, silence.
A visitation.

219
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,333
- Welcome, friend.

220
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:34,124
Welcome.

221
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,208
I...

222
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,791
General Julius Arundel,

223
00:15:49,084 --> 00:15:54,499
bring messages
from the other side.

224
00:15:56,834 --> 00:16:00,374
Where is Hercule?

225
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:04,041
I must speak with Hercule.

226
00:16:04,334 --> 00:16:06,708
- Madame?

227
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,166
- The message is from M.P.

228
00:16:13,459 --> 00:16:19,833
There is an M.P. in your life,
Hercule?

229
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:21,916
- Oui.
Marie Poirot.

230
00:16:22,209 --> 00:16:23,666
She was my grandmother.

231
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:26,499
- He says you have been lucky,

232
00:16:26,792 --> 00:16:33,208
but luck seldom strikes twice
at the same door.

233
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,958
This afternoon,
down by the lake,

234
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,041
the danger receded, yes,

235
00:16:38,334 --> 00:16:41,333
but only to gather
its strength.

236
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:47,208
I see it move on

237
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:51,624
and find its mark in...

238
00:16:51,917 --> 00:16:55,499
Emily!

239
00:16:55,792 --> 00:16:58,749
- Why I put up with this
nonsense, I shall never know.

240
00:17:08,542 --> 00:17:10,374
- What the devil is she saying?

241
00:17:10,667 --> 00:17:12,166
- It is Greek.

242
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:14,958
She says you have all
been warned.

243
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:41,291
- I just wondered if you were
having trouble sleeping.

244
00:17:41,584 --> 00:17:43,458
- And so you awaken me
to inquire?

245
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:48,333
That is friendship indeed,
Hastings.

246
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:51,249
- I'm sorry, Poirot.
It was that business at dinner.

247
00:17:51,542 --> 00:17:54,208
The general hauling out
your granny like that.

248
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,208
I mean, how did he know?

249
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,333
- Regarde, mon ami.

250
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:09,833
There is a J.H.
in your family past?

251
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:13,708
- Yes.
My uncle Jack.

252
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,208
What does he say?

253
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,624
- He says you are
to go back to your room

254
00:18:18,917 --> 00:18:22,166
and leave me in peace.

255
00:18:22,459 --> 00:18:25,583
- Right.

256
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:29,749
That's amazing, Poirot.

257
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:33,291
- Alas, it is guesswork,
mon ami.

258
00:18:33,584 --> 00:18:35,624
It would be strange not to find
a James, a John, or a Jack

259
00:18:35,917 --> 00:18:37,624
in an English family.

260
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:40,291
So it is in Belgium,
with M for Marie.

261
00:18:40,584 --> 00:18:43,291
- Yes, yes, I suppose so.

262
00:18:43,584 --> 00:18:45,333
But what about
those evil forces?

263
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,208
- They are in the mind
of Isabel Tripp, mon ami,

264
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,458
and nowhere else.

265
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,416
And yet...

266
00:18:52,709 --> 00:18:56,749
And yet, there is no smoke
without a fire.

267
00:19:42,042 --> 00:19:43,749
- Oh!

268
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,583
- What is it?

269
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:58,791
- What's happened?

270
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,208
- Oh, my God.
Go and get your father.

271
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,541
Go on, quickly.

272
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:05,458
- Father, wake up!
- Aunty?

273
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,666
- What the hell is going on?

274
00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:08,624
Is there some party
or something?

275
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,999
Oh, God!

276
00:20:12,334 --> 00:20:13,166
- Charles...

277
00:20:13,459 --> 00:20:16,708
- Aunt Emily?
Aunty?

278
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,749
Aunty?

279
00:20:19,042 --> 00:20:20,999
- Don't touch her!

280
00:20:21,292 --> 00:20:22,583
- Stay here, children.

281
00:20:34,709 --> 00:20:37,958
- Shh!

282
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,874
- Alexis!

283
00:20:40,167 --> 00:20:42,916
- She's not dead, is she?

284
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:45,374
- She's alive.
- Look at this!

285
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:46,833
- Bob's ball.

286
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,333
She must have stood on it
and lost her balance.

287
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:15,833
- Oh, Mr. Poirot, thank you
so very much for coming.

288
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:18,708
Emily has been asking
for you.

289
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:25,416
- I keep going over it
in my mind, Mr. Poirot.

290
00:21:25,709 --> 00:21:28,749
I mean, did I step on
Bob's ball?

291
00:21:29,042 --> 00:21:33,208
It is unlike him
to leave it there.

292
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,541
- Perhaps it is not animals
that trouble you, madame,

293
00:21:35,834 --> 00:21:39,249
but also the human beings--

294
00:21:39,542 --> 00:21:41,833
both alive and dead,
perhaps.

295
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:46,166
- You don't mean Isabel Tripp
could be right, surely,

296
00:21:46,459 --> 00:21:48,124
and I'm really in danger?

297
00:21:48,417 --> 00:21:51,541
- Alas, it is possible,
madame.

298
00:21:51,834 --> 00:21:54,833
- Then it can only be
for my money.

299
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:02,583
What would you do, Mr. Poirot,
in my position?

300
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:08,166
- Had I the family who would
be to gain from my death?

301
00:22:11,667 --> 00:22:13,749
Et bien.

302
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:17,666
I would make a new will,
without delay,

303
00:22:17,959 --> 00:22:20,791
leaving all to a good friend
that I could trust.

304
00:22:21,084 --> 00:22:23,666
- And would you tell
this friend?

305
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:25,999
- Non, non, non,
pas du tout.

306
00:22:26,292 --> 00:22:28,416
But I would tell to all those
named in the old will

307
00:22:28,709 --> 00:22:30,624
that they were in it
no longer.

308
00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:32,208
- Wouldn't that anger them?

309
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,666
- Oui, bien sûr.

310
00:22:34,959 --> 00:22:38,874
But they would make certain
that no accident befell me,

311
00:22:39,167 --> 00:22:41,666
hoping that one day I would
change my will again

312
00:22:41,959 --> 00:22:45,249
and favor them.

313
00:22:45,542 --> 00:22:48,333
- I like that.

314
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:52,291
I like that very much,
Mr. Poirot.

315
00:22:59,917 --> 00:23:01,249
- Un medicament, docteur?

316
00:23:01,542 --> 00:23:04,499
- Yes, Poirot.
Exprotin for Emily's liver.

317
00:23:04,792 --> 00:23:06,291
- Perhaps for that
she has the capsules?

318
00:23:06,584 --> 00:23:08,958
- Gimmicks from
a local herbalist.

319
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,249
I've thrown them away.

320
00:23:14,084 --> 00:23:15,708
Good morning, Emily.

321
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,874
I brought you your medicine.

322
00:24:12,209 --> 00:24:16,416
- Mr. Poirot, I'd like a word
with you in private.

323
00:24:17,834 --> 00:24:19,333
- In the garden, perhaps,
Madame Tanios?

324
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:22,416
- No, no, it's too risky.

325
00:24:22,709 --> 00:24:26,541
I'll call on you at teatime
at the Motor Boat Club.

326
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:38,499
- This Monsieur Wordsworth,
the poet of these parts,

327
00:24:38,792 --> 00:24:40,499
he annoys me, Hastings.

328
00:24:40,792 --> 00:24:42,249
Clearly he is a slave
to depression,

329
00:24:42,542 --> 00:24:43,833
but you know what cheers him,
mon ami?

330
00:24:44,125 --> 00:24:45,833
A good wine?
A large beefsteak?

331
00:24:46,125 --> 00:24:48,124
The company of a woman
most enchanting?

332
00:24:48,417 --> 00:24:50,333
No.
A daffodil.

333
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:52,166
Ouais.

334
00:24:52,459 --> 00:24:54,958
"Beside the lake,
beneath the trees"--

335
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:59,249
- "Fluttering and dancing
in the breeze."

336
00:24:59,542 --> 00:25:00,833
- There.
Over there, madam.

337
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:02,458
- Thank you.

338
00:25:04,959 --> 00:25:06,249
- Good afternoon, madame.

339
00:25:06,542 --> 00:25:08,041
- I'll not beat about the bush,
Mr. Poirot.

340
00:25:08,334 --> 00:25:10,249
Charles and Theresa,
they've been scrounging money

341
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:11,499
off Aunt Emily
for years.

342
00:25:11,792 --> 00:25:13,166
And just lately,
she's begun to say no,

343
00:25:13,459 --> 00:25:14,583
and quite right too.

344
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:16,999
- Please do calm yourself
and sit down, madame.

345
00:25:17,292 --> 00:25:19,166
- Thank you.

346
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,624
That fall was no accident,
Mr. Poirot.

347
00:25:22,917 --> 00:25:25,124
She was pushed by one of them.
I know it!

348
00:25:25,417 --> 00:25:28,041
But if my husband knew
I was accusing them, he--

349
00:25:28,334 --> 00:25:29,124
he'd...

350
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:32,083
- You fear him, madame?

351
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:35,249
- No, no, forgive me.
I am safe here, at least.

352
00:25:35,542 --> 00:25:38,208
- Why here?

353
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,666
- People like Jacob
aren't welcome

354
00:25:39,959 --> 00:25:41,999
at the Motor Boat Club, Captain,
if you get my drift.

355
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:44,291
- Comment?

356
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:47,124
- He's different.
Foreign.

357
00:25:47,417 --> 00:25:49,124
- Mais moi aussi.

358
00:25:49,417 --> 00:25:52,666
- Yes, but you're famous,
Mr. Poirot.

359
00:25:52,959 --> 00:25:54,166
However safe or not,

360
00:25:54,459 --> 00:25:57,249
I'd rather we kept this meeting
to ourselves.

361
00:25:57,542 --> 00:25:59,541
- Of course, madame.

362
00:26:03,959 --> 00:26:05,999
- Hello, Aunty.
- Morning, Aunt!

363
00:26:06,292 --> 00:26:10,208
- Isn't it glorious?
- Oh, what a lovely day.

364
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,666
The roses are looking perfect.

365
00:26:12,959 --> 00:26:15,166
- Three visits
in as many days.

366
00:26:15,459 --> 00:26:16,666
I am honored.

367
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:20,583
- Oh, you are looking
so much better, Aunt Em.

368
00:26:20,875 --> 00:26:24,499
- The result, perhaps,
of changing my will.

369
00:26:28,084 --> 00:26:29,791
Good heavens.

370
00:26:30,084 --> 00:26:33,416
I never thought to see
you both lost for words.

371
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:40,499
- You've changed your will?

372
00:26:40,792 --> 00:26:44,749
- Yes, dear, I am cutting
my family off without a penny.

373
00:26:45,042 --> 00:26:46,583
- But if we don't inherit,
who the hell does?

374
00:26:46,875 --> 00:26:48,166
- Why do you want to do
a thing like that?

375
00:26:48,459 --> 00:26:49,749
What have we done to you
anyhow?

376
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:51,833
- You threatened me, Charles.

377
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:55,291
"I won't allow anyone
to stand in my way," remember?

378
00:26:55,584 --> 00:26:57,083
- Oh, that wasn't a threat.
It was a joke.

379
00:26:57,375 --> 00:26:59,249
- But what about the silver
service you promised me?

380
00:26:59,542 --> 00:27:00,708
Does that go
to someone else now?

381
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,249
- And the paintings, Aunt Em?

382
00:27:02,542 --> 00:27:04,624
You always said that one day
the paintings would be mine.

383
00:27:04,917 --> 00:27:06,749
- Hello?
Littlegreen House.

384
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,458
- Wilhemina, is Emily there?

385
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,166
I would like to speak to her.

386
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:17,624
- Yes?
Jacob.

387
00:27:19,209 --> 00:27:20,874
- I would like us to meet,
Emily.

388
00:27:21,167 --> 00:27:22,666
I am worried about you.

389
00:27:33,709 --> 00:27:35,958
- You question all my decisions.
- Please.

390
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:38,624
- I've got it written down.

391
00:27:40,584 --> 00:27:41,666
- Yes, but what kind of--

392
00:27:41,959 --> 00:27:44,333
- Don't question everything
I have to say.

393
00:27:51,959 --> 00:27:53,249
Thank you, madam.

394
00:27:53,542 --> 00:27:57,124
- First, you tell me
how you are.

395
00:27:57,417 --> 00:27:59,499
- Do you really want to know?

396
00:27:59,792 --> 00:28:04,166
I feel tired, Jacob.
And ancient.

397
00:28:04,459 --> 00:28:08,583
Which is why, I suppose,
I keep snapping at Minnie,

398
00:28:08,875 --> 00:28:11,874
the one person who stands by me
no matter what.

399
00:28:12,167 --> 00:28:16,374
- She knows you don't mean it.

400
00:28:16,667 --> 00:28:21,124
- Well, I never.
Look at that.

401
00:28:21,417 --> 00:28:23,166
Love, do you think?

402
00:28:23,459 --> 00:28:25,041
- Let us hope so.

403
00:28:25,334 --> 00:28:27,874
He's a good man,
a good doctor.

404
00:28:28,167 --> 00:28:31,708
- You say that in spite of
his coldness towards you.

405
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,666
How generous you are.

406
00:28:34,959 --> 00:28:37,749
- I, too, have noticed
your weariness, Emily.

407
00:28:38,042 --> 00:28:40,499
I want you to try this.

408
00:28:40,792 --> 00:28:44,874
The recipe has been
in my family 200 years.

409
00:28:45,167 --> 00:28:48,249
- Quite new then, for Greeks.

410
00:28:51,167 --> 00:28:54,583
Jacob, do you think someone
is trying to kill me?

411
00:28:54,875 --> 00:28:58,916
- Emily, who would do
such a thing?

412
00:28:59,209 --> 00:29:02,916
- Mr. Poirot seems to think
it's possible.

413
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:13,708
- Sir?

414
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,499
Mr. Poirot?

415
00:29:17,792 --> 00:29:20,124
There's a gentleman
to see you, sir.

416
00:29:20,417 --> 00:29:21,666
He is outside.

417
00:29:21,959 --> 00:29:23,749
- Then ask him to come in.

418
00:29:24,042 --> 00:29:28,874
- Rather not, sir.
He is not a member.

419
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:31,499
- I am not a member.

420
00:29:31,792 --> 00:29:33,666
- It's Dr. Tanios, sir.

421
00:29:33,959 --> 00:29:35,666
- Ah.

422
00:29:35,959 --> 00:29:39,249
And, of course,
he is not famous.

423
00:29:45,625 --> 00:29:46,833
Monsieur.

424
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:49,666
- Why are you frightening Emily,
Mr. Poirot?

425
00:29:49,959 --> 00:29:51,374
- When have I done
such a thing?

426
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:54,041
- You speak of designs
upon her life.

427
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,749
- From duty, monsieur,
to warn her.

428
00:29:57,042 --> 00:29:59,583
- Of a fantasy
woven by Isabel Tripp.

429
00:29:59,875 --> 00:30:02,499
- I do not speak of a fantasy,
monsieur.

430
00:30:02,792 --> 00:30:05,458
I speak of a possible crime
against Aunt Emily,

431
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,208
and I am not alone
in my fears.

432
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,874
- Who else believes this?

433
00:30:11,167 --> 00:30:13,249
- I merely say
that I am not alone.

434
00:30:13,542 --> 00:30:16,499
- But you mention no name,
because there is none.

435
00:30:16,792 --> 00:30:18,166
Very well,
in the interest of my family

436
00:30:18,459 --> 00:30:19,374
and their peace of mind,

437
00:30:19,667 --> 00:30:22,999
please do not speak to Emily
again.

438
00:30:28,834 --> 00:30:30,999
- I don't like him either,
Poirot.

439
00:30:31,292 --> 00:30:33,041
- Quite so.

440
00:30:33,334 --> 00:30:36,458
If you please, Hastings,
ask a steward to fetch our hats.

441
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,333
- Where are we going?

442
00:30:38,625 --> 00:30:40,208
- Littlegreen House.

443
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,624
- Thank you, dear.

444
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:55,374
- I'm sorry, dear.

445
00:30:55,667 --> 00:30:57,124
- Forgive me.

446
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:01,916
It's been a long day.

447
00:31:02,209 --> 00:31:04,999
- But you look better than
you have for weeks.

448
00:31:05,292 --> 00:31:07,041
Doesn't she look well, Julia?

449
00:31:07,334 --> 00:31:08,916
- Oh, yes, dear.

450
00:31:09,209 --> 00:31:11,624
- Why does everyone lie to me?

451
00:31:11,917 --> 00:31:15,166
I look dreadful.

452
00:31:15,459 --> 00:31:20,166
Wilhemina,
in my bag, there's a bottle.

453
00:31:20,459 --> 00:31:22,999
Pass it to me.

454
00:31:23,292 --> 00:31:24,874
- Not your liver capsules,
dear?

455
00:31:25,167 --> 00:31:29,208
- If I'd meant liver capsules,
I should have said so.

456
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,583
The bottle.

457
00:31:44,667 --> 00:31:49,374
Jacob gave it to me
earlier today.

458
00:31:49,667 --> 00:31:50,791
It's his own preparation.

459
00:31:51,084 --> 00:31:53,249
- You're not going to take it,
surely.

460
00:31:53,542 --> 00:31:55,749
It could be Greek.

461
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,874
- I don't care if it hails
from the Moon.

462
00:32:07,917 --> 00:32:09,916
I need some air.

463
00:32:10,209 --> 00:32:11,999
- Yes, that will help too.

464
00:32:12,292 --> 00:32:15,124
It's a lovely evening.

465
00:32:25,709 --> 00:32:28,791
- Leave me alone, Minnie,
for heaven's sake!

466
00:32:31,084 --> 00:32:33,958
- All I've ever tried to do
for Emily is my best.

467
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:37,583
- She knows that, dear.
Deep down, she knows it.

468
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:42,083
- Oh, yes.
You've been an absolute saint.

469
00:32:58,334 --> 00:33:02,583
- Don't be afraid, dear.

470
00:33:02,875 --> 00:33:05,583
It's her spirit,

471
00:33:05,875 --> 00:33:09,416
reaching out to the ethers.

472
00:33:09,709 --> 00:33:14,041
- You mean...
dying?

473
00:33:14,334 --> 00:33:20,666
- She is crossing over,
even as we look at her.

474
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:25,541
Oh, what an adventure!

475
00:33:28,334 --> 00:33:30,249
- Emily! Emily!

476
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:32,124
- Don't worry, my dear.

477
00:33:32,417 --> 00:33:34,374
Hello, Bob.

478
00:33:34,667 --> 00:33:36,458
- Qu'est-ce que c'est,
Monsieur Bob?

479
00:33:41,792 --> 00:33:43,708
Vite, Hastings.

480
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,041
- Emily.
Emily.

481
00:33:46,334 --> 00:33:47,749
- If you please, madame.

482
00:33:48,042 --> 00:33:50,083
- Mr. Poirot, what's happening?

483
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:54,666
Is she all right?

484
00:33:58,209 --> 00:34:00,041
- No, madame.

485
00:34:02,834 --> 00:34:04,333
She is dead.

486
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:05,666
- Oh!

487
00:34:29,917 --> 00:34:32,541
- Just once more I beg of you,
Sergeant Keeley,

488
00:34:32,834 --> 00:34:34,333
get the coroner to order
a postmortem

489
00:34:34,625 --> 00:34:35,583
on the body
of Emily Arundel.

490
00:34:35,875 --> 00:34:36,874
- I'm sorry, sir.

491
00:34:37,167 --> 00:34:39,291
We treat our dead with respect
in these parts,

492
00:34:39,584 --> 00:34:42,041
especially the good souls
like Mrs. Arundel.

493
00:34:42,334 --> 00:34:43,166
- But her death, monsieur,

494
00:34:43,459 --> 00:34:44,833
there are questions
that need answers.

495
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:46,374
Evidence may be buried
with her.

496
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:48,041
- I've got the only evidence
I need:

497
00:34:48,334 --> 00:34:49,374
the death certificate,

498
00:34:49,667 --> 00:34:51,333
that says she died
of liver failure.

499
00:34:51,625 --> 00:34:54,583
So amen to that.

500
00:35:29,042 --> 00:35:31,416
- "For He knoweth whereof
we are made;

501
00:35:31,709 --> 00:35:36,124
"He rembereth
that we are but dust.

502
00:35:36,417 --> 00:35:39,083
"The days of man
are but His grass,

503
00:35:39,375 --> 00:35:43,249
"for He flourisheth
as a flower of the field,

504
00:35:43,542 --> 00:35:48,166
"for as soon as the wind goeth
over it, it is gone,

505
00:35:48,459 --> 00:35:53,666
"and the place thereof
shall know it no more.

506
00:35:53,959 --> 00:35:55,999
"But the merciful goodness
of the Lord

507
00:35:56,292 --> 00:36:00,833
"endureth forever and ever
upon them that fear Him,

508
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:05,416
and His righteousness upon
His children's children."

509
00:36:05,709 --> 00:36:07,958
- Nice of you to come,
Mr. Poirot.

510
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:11,291
She wasn't a bad old stick.

511
00:36:11,584 --> 00:36:14,249
- I wish I'd told her that,
you know?

512
00:36:14,542 --> 00:36:15,708
Never did.

513
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,958
- "And it is certain we can
carry nothing out.

514
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:21,999
"The Lord gave, and the Lord
hath taken away.

515
00:36:22,292 --> 00:36:24,333
Blessed be the name
of the Lord."

516
00:36:40,959 --> 00:36:43,249
- Pauvre chien.

517
00:36:43,542 --> 00:36:44,958
Through all,
you greet your visitors

518
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:48,124
with agitating of the tail,
huh?

519
00:36:48,417 --> 00:36:50,916
But not today.

520
00:37:07,084 --> 00:37:08,666
- Ladies and gentlemen,

521
00:37:08,959 --> 00:37:12,416
Mrs. Arundel's solicitor
has asked me to read the will,

522
00:37:12,709 --> 00:37:14,499
since I am its executor.

523
00:37:14,792 --> 00:37:18,208
It's a simple document,
dated the 10th of this month.

524
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:23,416
It leaves everything Emily owned
to Wilhemina Lawson.

525
00:37:27,209 --> 00:37:29,124
- No.

526
00:37:29,417 --> 00:37:31,541
No, she mustn't!

527
00:37:31,834 --> 00:37:33,624
- The family gets nothing,
John?

528
00:37:33,917 --> 00:37:37,291
- No.

529
00:37:37,584 --> 00:37:38,708
- Monsieur le docteur,

530
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,541
I should like to know,
if you please,

531
00:37:40,834 --> 00:37:43,749
who benefitted
from the old will.

532
00:37:44,042 --> 00:37:45,791
- Everyone in the room,
in some measure,

533
00:37:46,084 --> 00:37:48,291
most for
a few hundred pounds.

534
00:37:48,584 --> 00:37:51,166
Charles, Theresa, and Bella
would have had the lion's share.

535
00:37:51,459 --> 00:37:54,458
Why?

536
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:58,208
- I believe that she was
murdered, monsieur.

537
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:03,916
- And by whom, I wonder?

538
00:38:04,209 --> 00:38:05,333
Oh, don't think
we haven't noticed

539
00:38:05,625 --> 00:38:07,708
you two huddled into corners,

540
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,708
plotting and planning
like a couple of children.

541
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,041
- Oh, don't blame them.
Blame our little Belgian friend.

542
00:38:12,334 --> 00:38:14,166
He's the one who got her
to change her damn will!

543
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:15,999
- Emily died of liver failure.

544
00:38:16,292 --> 00:38:17,874
- And you helped her
on her way

545
00:38:18,167 --> 00:38:20,041
by throwing out
those liver capsules.

546
00:38:20,334 --> 00:38:21,458
- They were useless--

547
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:24,249
the triumph of advertising
over good medical sense.

548
00:38:24,542 --> 00:38:28,749
- I know of at least one attempt
upon her life.

549
00:38:29,042 --> 00:38:32,208
Could I have saved her?

550
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:36,166
That is a question
that will follow me to my grave.

551
00:38:38,959 --> 00:38:40,916
If you please to come.

552
00:38:44,167 --> 00:38:47,958
The morning after the fall
of Emily Arundel,

553
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:51,166
I paid a visit,

554
00:38:51,459 --> 00:38:55,166
and I observed
in the skirting

555
00:38:55,459 --> 00:38:59,666
a screw eye,

556
00:38:59,959 --> 00:39:02,124
to which a string or cord
might be attached

557
00:39:02,417 --> 00:39:04,541
and stretched across
to the banister.

558
00:39:04,834 --> 00:39:07,749
- Like a trip wire,
you mean?

559
00:39:10,209 --> 00:39:11,833
- Precisement.

560
00:39:12,125 --> 00:39:13,333
- Oh, do go on, Mr. Poirot.

561
00:39:13,625 --> 00:39:15,708
It sounds absolutely
damning.

562
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,499
- Proof positive, I'd say.

563
00:39:19,792 --> 00:39:22,583
- But this murderer
makes mistakes.

564
00:39:22,875 --> 00:39:27,499
The first of which
was to remove the screw eye,

565
00:39:27,792 --> 00:39:30,874
because now I know
it was important.

566
00:39:35,084 --> 00:39:37,374
- What exactly do you do
up here, Charlie?

567
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:39,416
- Hadn't you noticed, Battler?

568
00:39:39,709 --> 00:39:41,916
I drive boats, fast.

569
00:39:42,209 --> 00:39:45,249
- Yes, but I mean, you know,
what do you do?

570
00:39:45,542 --> 00:39:47,416
- Well, up until Aunt Em died,

571
00:39:47,709 --> 00:39:49,916
I was a sort of
investment advisor.

572
00:39:50,209 --> 00:39:51,791
- That sounds interesting.
- Hmm.

573
00:39:52,084 --> 00:39:54,874
I advised, and she invested,
in me.

574
00:39:55,167 --> 00:39:57,541
Until she spoiled it all
by changing her damn will.

575
00:39:57,834 --> 00:40:03,124
For which, Monsieur Poirot,
merci beaucoup.

576
00:40:03,417 --> 00:40:06,041
- Well, he only did
what he thought was right.

577
00:40:06,334 --> 00:40:07,499
- Did he?

578
00:40:15,084 --> 00:40:19,958
- Again and again I ask myself,
Hastings.

579
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:23,458
The advice that I gave to her
to change her will,

580
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:26,416
was it was good,
or was it bad?

581
00:40:26,709 --> 00:40:28,624
Could I have prevented
her death?

582
00:40:28,917 --> 00:40:30,749
- Or if Grainger's right
and it was liver failure,

583
00:40:31,042 --> 00:40:32,124
no, you couldn't.

584
00:40:32,417 --> 00:40:35,083
- And what is the cause
of liver failure, Hastings?

585
00:40:35,375 --> 00:40:36,666
- Old age.

586
00:40:36,959 --> 00:40:41,291
- And I say that
she was murdered.

587
00:40:41,584 --> 00:40:45,291
Never, in all my years,
has a little detail so vexed me.

588
00:40:45,584 --> 00:40:48,958
The motive, Hastings.

589
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:51,416
Maybe if she was murdered
before the changing of the will,

590
00:40:51,709 --> 00:40:52,833
I could understand--

591
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:56,541
"Let us kill her quickly,
then we can inherit."

592
00:40:56,834 --> 00:41:00,583
But after...

593
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,041
Who will benefit?

594
00:41:03,334 --> 00:41:05,583
- Could it have been revenge?

595
00:41:05,875 --> 00:41:07,499
- Excuse me, sir.

596
00:41:07,792 --> 00:41:11,583
A lady and a gentleman
wish to see you in the lounge.

597
00:41:11,875 --> 00:41:14,416
They have a dog with them.

598
00:41:14,709 --> 00:41:16,916
- A fox terrier, perhaps?

599
00:41:17,209 --> 00:41:18,791
- And you don't really
have any control over--

600
00:41:21,625 --> 00:41:23,083
Come here!

601
00:41:23,375 --> 00:41:24,458
- Damn dog!

602
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:26,458
No idea how to conduct himself
in public.

603
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,208
- It's his way of showing
his grief.

604
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,749
Oh, Bob, please behave!

605
00:41:31,042 --> 00:41:33,958
- Bob, you will sit!

606
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,249
Voilà.

607
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:41,249
Hastings.

608
00:41:45,417 --> 00:41:48,291
- Odd request, Poirot.

609
00:41:48,584 --> 00:41:50,166
Wilhemina wants you
to question her.

610
00:41:50,459 --> 00:41:51,333
- Mi pour quoi?

611
00:41:51,625 --> 00:41:54,458
- To stop people
talking about me.

612
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:57,166
They will, you know,
as if...

613
00:41:57,459 --> 00:41:58,833
Well, as if--

614
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:00,958
- As if you had killed
Aunt Emily Arundel

615
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:02,874
in order to benefit
from her will?

616
00:42:03,167 --> 00:42:04,166
- There you are.
You see?

617
00:42:04,459 --> 00:42:05,624
He thinks so too.

618
00:42:05,917 --> 00:42:07,999
But I swear, I didn't know
I'd inherit her money.

619
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:10,416
- No one knew, madame.

620
00:42:10,709 --> 00:42:13,166
I myself advised this.

621
00:42:13,459 --> 00:42:16,999
- Nevertheless, Poirot,
we've had one or two ideas.

622
00:42:17,292 --> 00:42:20,999
Tell him what you told me,
my dear.

623
00:42:21,292 --> 00:42:22,541
- It was just that
you were saying

624
00:42:22,834 --> 00:42:25,833
that someone had tried
to kill Emily.

625
00:42:26,125 --> 00:42:30,624
And now with her dying,

626
00:42:30,917 --> 00:42:34,374
well, the night before
the accident,

627
00:42:34,667 --> 00:42:37,416
Bob woke me,
wanting to play.

628
00:42:39,625 --> 00:42:41,249
Be quiet, Bob.

629
00:42:41,542 --> 00:42:44,874
There was someone
on the landing with him.

630
00:42:45,167 --> 00:42:47,166
I told them to put him
in his basket.

631
00:42:47,459 --> 00:42:51,583
Put him in his basket
before he wakes the whole house.

632
00:42:51,875 --> 00:42:53,458
I didn't see the face,

633
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:55,833
but on the dressing gown,
there was this monogram

634
00:42:56,125 --> 00:42:58,041
in gold embroidery,

635
00:42:58,334 --> 00:43:01,833
the initials T.A.

636
00:43:02,125 --> 00:43:06,124
- Theresa Arundel.
But surely not.

637
00:43:07,625 --> 00:43:09,583
- I'm frightened, Mr. Poirot.

638
00:43:09,875 --> 00:43:12,291
I might be next.

639
00:43:12,584 --> 00:43:15,416
- Your fears are easy
to overcome, madame.

640
00:43:15,709 --> 00:43:16,624
Give your inheritance

641
00:43:16,917 --> 00:43:19,166
to all those named
in the first will.

642
00:43:21,667 --> 00:43:23,291
- Oh.

643
00:43:23,584 --> 00:43:29,333
But surely that would be
going against Emily's wishes.

644
00:43:29,625 --> 00:43:31,999
- Perhaps.

645
00:43:32,292 --> 00:43:33,583
- Come, my dear.

646
00:43:33,875 --> 00:43:36,374
I think we've given Mr. Poirot
enough food for thought.

647
00:43:36,667 --> 00:43:38,499
- One more thing, Mr. Poirot.

648
00:43:38,792 --> 00:43:42,249
- Madame?
- It's Bob.

649
00:43:42,542 --> 00:43:45,541
He doesn't like
living with me.

650
00:43:45,834 --> 00:43:48,666
You, on the other hand,
seem just his sort of person.

651
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:51,208
- No, madame, I could not.
The responsibility...

652
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:55,624
- Otherwise, it's curtains
for him, I'm afraid, Poirot.

653
00:44:09,292 --> 00:44:10,874
- The walking of the dog
before breakfast?

654
00:44:11,167 --> 00:44:12,374
Non, mon ami.

655
00:44:12,667 --> 00:44:14,999
The routine of Bob
is not the routine of Poirot.

656
00:44:15,292 --> 00:44:17,708
- A bit more exercise will do
you a power of good, Poirot.

657
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,666
- But you yourself are
a keen walker, Hastings.

658
00:44:19,959 --> 00:44:21,291
- Yes, I am.
- Well, then?

659
00:44:21,584 --> 00:44:24,833
- No, Poirot, Bob is not
moving in with me.

660
00:44:42,667 --> 00:44:43,958
Good morning.
- Hello.

661
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:46,124
- Bonjour, mademoiselle.

662
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:47,958
- I've been meaning to do that
for six months.

663
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:51,749
The rain last night
rather forced my hand.

664
00:44:52,042 --> 00:44:53,749
- Mademoiselle,
this may seem to you

665
00:44:54,042 --> 00:44:55,833
a question
that is most strange,

666
00:44:56,125 --> 00:44:57,249
but do you have
in your possession

667
00:44:57,542 --> 00:45:01,499
a dressing gown on which
are the initials T.A.?

668
00:45:01,792 --> 00:45:03,083
- Somewhere, yes,

669
00:45:03,375 --> 00:45:05,791
but, quite frankly,
I wouldn't be seen dead in it.

670
00:45:06,084 --> 00:45:07,083
- Comment?

671
00:45:07,375 --> 00:45:08,833
- I bought it before
they were all the rage,

672
00:45:09,125 --> 00:45:11,916
and now everyone's got them,
men and women.

673
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:14,708
Why?

674
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,708
- Wilhemina Lawson saw a person
wearing it

675
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,541
on the night
before the accident,

676
00:45:18,834 --> 00:45:22,541
and it has made her fearful
for her safety,

677
00:45:22,834 --> 00:45:27,041
but sadly not enough
to give back her money.

678
00:45:27,334 --> 00:45:29,749
- Well, I got my solicitor
working on that.

679
00:45:30,042 --> 00:45:33,041
With any luck,
he'll revoke the new will,

680
00:45:33,334 --> 00:45:36,624
and I'll be able to afford
a decent place to live in.

681
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,249
- Oh, Mr. Poirot, there's
a telephone call for you.

682
00:45:48,542 --> 00:45:49,999
Will you take it here, sir?

683
00:45:50,292 --> 00:45:51,583
- Oui.
Who wishes to speak with me?

684
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:54,874
- Miss Emily Arundel, sir.

685
00:45:57,917 --> 00:45:59,999
- She is dead, mon ami.

686
00:46:00,292 --> 00:46:04,041
- You'll have to take that up
with her yourself, sir.

687
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,499
- Hercule Poirot is here.

688
00:46:22,792 --> 00:46:26,666
- Mr. Poirot,
this is so thrilling.

689
00:46:26,959 --> 00:46:30,416
Isabel is in touch with Emily

690
00:46:30,709 --> 00:46:33,499
at this very moment.

691
00:46:36,542 --> 00:46:41,249
- Then please to convey to her
my kind regards.

692
00:46:41,542 --> 00:46:43,958
- She just whisked in
from the ethers

693
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:46,666
over our second cup of tea.

694
00:46:46,959 --> 00:46:50,541
She's dying to speak to you.
Shall I put her on?

695
00:46:50,834 --> 00:46:54,124
- Non, non, non, non!

696
00:46:54,417 --> 00:46:58,458
Just take a message,
and I will call on you later.

697
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:01,208
Merci.

698
00:47:21,584 --> 00:47:24,958
- Emily knows you blame yourself
for her crossing over,

699
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:26,958
and she says it's very silly.

700
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:29,833
- And she wants to put your mind
at rest.

701
00:47:30,125 --> 00:47:33,374
She said, "Why don't we hold
a séance

702
00:47:33,667 --> 00:47:36,291
and invite all your suspects?"

703
00:47:36,584 --> 00:47:37,458
- All the people you think

704
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:40,499
may have eased her path
into the next world.

705
00:47:40,792 --> 00:47:42,416
- Then,
when they're all gathered,

706
00:47:42,709 --> 00:47:44,916
Emily, through Isabel,

707
00:47:45,209 --> 00:47:47,749
will point out
the one responsible.

708
00:47:48,042 --> 00:47:49,874
What do you say, Mr. Poirot?

709
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:51,791
- I think it is an idea
most splendid.

710
00:47:52,084 --> 00:47:54,041
Name for me, if you please,
a day for this séance.

711
00:47:54,334 --> 00:47:56,291
- Oh, shall we say Friday night?
8:00?

712
00:47:56,584 --> 00:47:59,791
We'll have some food and drink,
make a proper occasion of it.

713
00:48:00,084 --> 00:48:01,666
- Friday at 8:00.
Excélent.

714
00:48:01,959 --> 00:48:05,666
- You will make sure Dr. Tanios
is at the séance, won't you?

715
00:48:05,959 --> 00:48:06,958
- Oh, oui.

716
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:08,749
- They're going back to Greece
pretty soon.

717
00:48:09,042 --> 00:48:10,041
- But not until Friday.

718
00:48:10,334 --> 00:48:11,624
And besides, madame,
a move of house,

719
00:48:11,917 --> 00:48:14,041
even to another country,
is not a cause for murder.

720
00:48:14,334 --> 00:48:16,416
I myself am the living proof.

721
00:48:19,209 --> 00:48:22,499
- Then the bottle of medicine
Jacob gave Emily,

722
00:48:22,792 --> 00:48:26,083
which she took some of
the night she went,

723
00:48:26,375 --> 00:48:29,166
will be of no interest
to you?

724
00:48:32,292 --> 00:48:34,541
- Au contraire, madame.

725
00:48:34,834 --> 00:48:38,041
It interests me a great deal.

726
00:48:38,334 --> 00:48:40,583
Where is this bottle now?

727
00:48:46,709 --> 00:48:48,416
- Mademoiselle Sarah,
at this present time,

728
00:48:48,709 --> 00:48:50,333
I am interested
in the medicine cabinet.

729
00:48:50,625 --> 00:48:51,458
Is there one in the house?

730
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:52,874
- In the upstairs bathroom,
sir.

731
00:48:53,167 --> 00:48:54,583
- May I see it?
- Follow me.

732
00:48:54,875 --> 00:48:56,583
- Yes.

733
00:49:05,792 --> 00:49:08,291
Every time the catch,
and not once does he drop,

734
00:49:08,584 --> 00:49:10,708
and then the ball,
he takes back to his basket.

735
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,874
Does not this fox terrier
amaze you, Hastings?

736
00:49:13,167 --> 00:49:14,458
- Well, to be honest, Poirot,

737
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:17,208
I'm beginning to find his
repertoire a touch limited.

738
00:49:28,875 --> 00:49:30,208
- Liver capsules?

739
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,833
Dr. Grainger said he threw
these away, did he not?

740
00:49:33,125 --> 00:49:35,333
- Threw the ones he could find
away.

741
00:49:35,625 --> 00:49:39,416
She had others--
always a box on the go.

742
00:49:48,792 --> 00:49:54,249
- Doctor Jacob Tanios,
Hope Cottage, Hawkshead.

743
00:50:02,209 --> 00:50:03,874
Good Lord!

744
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:05,958
Smells absolutely lethal,
Poirot.

745
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:07,458
- Oui.

746
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:10,458
And as the sisters Tripp
have said, some has been taken.

747
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:12,499
- You know,
this séance of theirs,

748
00:50:12,792 --> 00:50:15,166
what makes you think everyone's
going to turn up?

749
00:50:15,459 --> 00:50:17,624
- Because he or she
who does not, Hastings,

750
00:50:17,917 --> 00:50:20,958
will surely prove that they
have something to hide.

751
00:50:23,584 --> 00:50:25,916
- Forgive me, Monsieur Poirot,
but as a man of method,

752
00:50:26,209 --> 00:50:28,041
surely you cannot believe
in a séance.

753
00:50:28,334 --> 00:50:29,583
- Non, non, monsieur.

754
00:50:29,875 --> 00:50:33,333
I myself do not believe, but
I believe that others believe,

755
00:50:33,625 --> 00:50:35,374
and therefore I will use it.

756
00:50:35,667 --> 00:50:37,666
- It's a golden opportunity,
if you ask me,

757
00:50:37,959 --> 00:50:41,291
for the Tripp sisters to accuse
people they don't like.

758
00:50:41,584 --> 00:50:45,083
- But nevertheless, madame,
you yourself will be present?

759
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:48,333
- We shall see.

760
00:50:52,917 --> 00:50:54,874
- And you, monsieur?

761
00:50:55,167 --> 00:50:57,791
I believe that it is soon
that you are to leave England.

762
00:50:58,084 --> 00:50:59,124
May I ask why?

763
00:50:59,417 --> 00:51:02,291
- Because in Greece,
I can practice medicine.

764
00:51:02,584 --> 00:51:03,374
- You could practice it here

765
00:51:03,667 --> 00:51:04,874
if so-called friends
would let you.

766
00:51:05,167 --> 00:51:06,249
- Bella, John Grainger
can't help

767
00:51:06,542 --> 00:51:07,499
what his patients believe.

768
00:51:07,792 --> 00:51:09,458
- Huh, they believe that
because your husband,

769
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:12,333
he's a foreigner, that he is
the devil himself, huh?

770
00:51:12,625 --> 00:51:14,166
- Yes.

771
00:51:23,959 --> 00:51:27,291
- A concoction of your own,
I believe.

772
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:28,624
- An extraction of herbs,

773
00:51:28,917 --> 00:51:30,999
providing many vitamins
and minerals.

774
00:51:31,292 --> 00:51:34,333
A "pick-me-up,"
they say in this country.

775
00:51:34,625 --> 00:51:38,583
- Which you gave
to Aunt Emily Arundel.

776
00:51:38,875 --> 00:51:42,416
If you please to take some?

777
00:51:42,709 --> 00:51:45,374
- You're a man who plays games,
Mr. Poirot.

778
00:51:45,667 --> 00:51:47,833
No, I will not take.

779
00:51:48,125 --> 00:51:49,208
- Mais pour quoi pas?

780
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:52,708
It is, as you said,
a pick-me-up, not a put-me-down.

781
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,708
- Yes, why not, Jacob?
What's wrong with it?

782
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,541
- Nothing.
- Then prove it to us.

783
00:52:03,584 --> 00:52:05,124
- Non, monsieur!

784
00:52:12,542 --> 00:52:16,666
I believe
you would have drunk.

785
00:52:16,959 --> 00:52:20,416
But suppose someone else
has poisoned it?

786
00:52:27,375 --> 00:52:29,583
She still fears him,
Hastings?

787
00:52:29,875 --> 00:52:31,541
- Terrified of him, I'd say.

788
00:52:31,834 --> 00:52:33,541
- I would not say the same.

789
00:52:33,834 --> 00:52:35,583
I would say that she no longer
loves him.

790
00:52:35,875 --> 00:52:37,624
My question is:
why this is love,

791
00:52:37,917 --> 00:52:39,249
it flies through the window?

792
00:52:39,542 --> 00:52:42,583
- Because of what he is:
a murderer.

793
00:52:42,875 --> 00:52:43,999
- Et bien.

794
00:52:44,292 --> 00:52:45,374
Let us see what Scotland Yard

795
00:52:45,667 --> 00:52:47,041
can make of this
Tanios medicine.

796
00:52:47,334 --> 00:52:49,291
We shall send it to them
by the registered post.

797
00:52:49,584 --> 00:52:51,416
- And in the meantime?

798
00:52:51,709 --> 00:52:52,791
- In the meantime,
we make a visit

799
00:52:53,084 --> 00:52:55,499
to your old friend
Monsieur Charles.

800
00:53:13,709 --> 00:53:17,458
Monsieur.

801
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:21,458
- I don't really like people
wandering in and out of here.

802
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:24,583
No offense.
Safety.

803
00:53:24,875 --> 00:53:26,166
- In case of another explosion?

804
00:53:26,459 --> 00:53:27,916
- How are the repairs going?

805
00:53:28,209 --> 00:53:29,166
- They'd go much faster

806
00:53:29,459 --> 00:53:31,208
if Aunt Em had stumped up
some cash.

807
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,583
Could have hired
a proper mechanic.

808
00:53:33,875 --> 00:53:37,374
- I was present, monsieur,
on the night that she declined.

809
00:53:37,667 --> 00:53:39,874
- You think I was trying
to scare her, don't you?

810
00:53:40,167 --> 00:53:42,416
No idea how tough she was.

811
00:53:42,709 --> 00:53:43,874
- No.

812
00:53:44,167 --> 00:53:47,374
But I do know that revenge,
it is sweet.

813
00:53:47,667 --> 00:53:49,499
And you are of a nature
most fiery, n'est-ce pas?

814
00:53:49,792 --> 00:53:51,374
As is your sister.

815
00:53:54,667 --> 00:53:56,583
- And, in your book,
that makes us murderers?

816
00:53:56,875 --> 00:53:58,208
- In my book, as you say,
monsieur,

817
00:53:58,500 --> 00:53:59,916
everyone is a suspect.

818
00:54:00,209 --> 00:54:01,041
And on this Friday evening,

819
00:54:01,334 --> 00:54:02,833
everyone is invited
to a party,

820
00:54:03,125 --> 00:54:05,583
including yourself
and your sister,

821
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:06,833
Mademoiselle Theresa.

822
00:54:07,125 --> 00:54:09,749
- A party?
Who's throwing it?

823
00:54:10,042 --> 00:54:14,458
- Your aunt,
Emily Arundel.

824
00:54:21,125 --> 00:54:24,999
- I, Emily Arundel,

825
00:54:25,292 --> 00:54:30,333
revisit you tonight
with a dark purpose.

826
00:54:30,625 --> 00:54:36,041
The evil that my father
warned us of

827
00:54:36,334 --> 00:54:40,583
has come to pass.

828
00:54:40,875 --> 00:54:45,083
Where is Dr. Grainger?

829
00:54:45,375 --> 00:54:48,708
- He sent his apologies,
Emily.

830
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,208
- These men of science

831
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:56,708
will never believe.

832
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,999
No matter.

833
00:54:59,292 --> 00:55:03,666
For someone in this room

834
00:55:03,959 --> 00:55:09,916
eased my path into
the next world,

835
00:55:10,209 --> 00:55:15,499
isn't that right,
Mr. Poirot?

836
00:55:15,792 --> 00:55:18,916
- It is called murder, madame.

837
00:55:19,209 --> 00:55:21,916
- Quite so.

838
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,541
See how they all flinch?

839
00:55:28,834 --> 00:55:33,708
Guilty consciences, Mr. Poirot?

840
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,041
How is your conscience,
Wilhemina?

841
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:40,166
- Good question.
- Is that you, Charles?

842
00:55:40,459 --> 00:55:42,249
Always ready to accuse,

843
00:55:42,542 --> 00:55:45,624
to blame the other party
for your own shortcomings.

844
00:55:45,917 --> 00:55:47,291
- Oh, what a rot.

845
00:55:47,584 --> 00:55:49,499
- Theresa...

846
00:55:49,792 --> 00:55:52,916
Always defending
your little brother,

847
00:55:53,209 --> 00:55:58,708
no matter what his crime.

848
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:03,916
Bella, dear,
why did you marry him?

849
00:56:04,209 --> 00:56:10,416
Why did you marry
that dreadful man?

850
00:56:16,417 --> 00:56:20,124
- I have a question, Emily,

851
00:56:20,417 --> 00:56:23,041
just for the record.

852
00:56:23,334 --> 00:56:28,374
Did either
Julia or Isabel Tripp

853
00:56:28,667 --> 00:56:32,749
have any hand
in your passing?

854
00:56:33,042 --> 00:56:35,124
- No, dear,

855
00:56:35,417 --> 00:56:38,749
but you're wise to ask.

856
00:56:39,042 --> 00:56:46,458
My killer
is known to you.

857
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:49,333
My killer

858
00:56:49,625 --> 00:56:54,333
is in this very room.

859
00:56:57,459 --> 00:57:00,499
See how they look
from face to face?

860
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:06,416
- A name would help, dear.

861
00:57:06,709 --> 00:57:12,124
- His name is...

862
00:57:12,417 --> 00:57:20,124
Robert Arundel.

863
00:57:20,417 --> 00:57:25,583
- Robert Arundel?
There's no such person.

864
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:28,791
- Oh, but there is.

865
00:57:29,084 --> 00:57:31,749
There is Monsieur Bob.

866
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,791
- Charles and Theresa,
Bella and Jacob,

867
00:57:48,084 --> 00:57:51,041
even Wilhemina
and Dr. Grainger,

868
00:57:51,334 --> 00:57:55,541
I say all are capable
of murder, mon ami.

869
00:57:55,834 --> 00:57:57,249
- Quite a list of suspects,
Poirot.

870
00:57:57,542 --> 00:57:58,499
- Which is not complete.

871
00:57:58,792 --> 00:58:01,083
You forget
the sisters Tripp.

872
00:58:01,375 --> 00:58:02,291
- Oh, those two?

873
00:58:02,584 --> 00:58:05,833
They're batty, yes,
but not killers, surely.

874
00:58:06,125 --> 00:58:10,291
- But what is murder
but a kind of madness, mon ami.

875
00:58:22,792 --> 00:58:26,041
Sit, Bob!

876
00:58:26,334 --> 00:58:27,791
Good dog.

877
00:58:30,625 --> 00:58:35,208
You are the only one who knows
the truth, mon petit.

878
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:38,958
You know
how your mistress died.

879
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:42,458
You also know, I think,
who killed her.

880
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:45,208
He or she passed you by
as they laid the trip wire,

881
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:46,291
saying to themselves,

882
00:58:46,584 --> 00:58:47,791
"Oh, this is only Bob,
a fox terrier.

883
00:58:48,084 --> 00:58:50,791
He cannot speak.
I am safe."

884
00:58:51,084 --> 00:58:55,249
Such foolishness,
n'est-ce pas?

885
00:58:57,542 --> 00:58:59,333
- But you and I, we know, Bob,

886
00:58:59,625 --> 00:59:03,333
that one does not have to speak
in order to tell.

887
00:59:03,625 --> 00:59:08,333
And you will tell to me all,
in your own good time.

888
00:59:11,625 --> 00:59:12,958
- Marvelous view from up here,
Poirot.

889
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:14,249
Come and have a look.

890
00:59:14,542 --> 00:59:17,208
- No, we will take your word
for it, Hastings.

891
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:19,999
But now there is work
to be done.

892
00:59:20,292 --> 00:59:24,416
First, we restore
the good name of Bob.

893
00:59:31,334 --> 00:59:34,249
At the séance last night,
Bella Tanios was asked

894
00:59:34,542 --> 00:59:36,708
why did she marry
that dreadful man,

895
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,833
meaning, of course,
her husband, Jacob.

896
00:59:39,125 --> 00:59:40,249
- Odd, really,

897
00:59:40,542 --> 00:59:44,874
because Emily was rather fond
of Jacob in this world.

898
00:59:45,167 --> 00:59:46,666
Must have changed her mind
since.

899
00:59:46,959 --> 00:59:49,124
- Was it a change of mind,
madame,

900
00:59:49,417 --> 00:59:50,916
or was it a mistake?

901
00:59:51,209 --> 00:59:53,583
- Oh, Emily never made mistakes.

902
00:59:57,084 --> 00:59:58,749
- Suppose it was not
the spirit of Emily Arundel

903
00:59:59,042 --> 01:00:00,124
that spoke to us.

904
01:00:00,417 --> 01:00:02,999
Suppose it was the subconscious
mind of Isabel Tripp.

905
01:00:03,292 --> 01:00:05,666
So then I ask myself, what
other mistakes does she make?

906
01:00:05,959 --> 01:00:08,374
Does she perhaps wrongly
accuse Robert Arundel?

907
01:00:08,667 --> 01:00:12,374
- But she's a trained medium,
Mr. Poirot.

908
01:00:12,667 --> 01:00:14,874
- She is also human, madame.

909
01:00:17,584 --> 01:00:20,124
If you would be so kind
as to tell to me, madame,

910
01:00:20,417 --> 01:00:23,083
if I wished to find an item
in the house,

911
01:00:23,375 --> 01:00:24,999
such as a screw eye
in the skirting,

912
01:00:25,292 --> 01:00:26,458
where would it be kept?

913
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:29,333
- The boathouse, I suppose.
- Ah.

914
01:00:29,625 --> 01:00:30,708
Where Monsieur Charles,

915
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,124
he does not like to welcome
the visitors, huh?

916
01:00:36,625 --> 01:00:39,874
- Bob, stop that, please!

917
01:00:44,042 --> 01:00:47,916
- Quel imbécile!

918
01:00:48,209 --> 01:00:49,833
Ever since we meet this dog,

919
01:00:50,125 --> 01:00:53,833
he tries to tell to me
something.

920
01:00:54,125 --> 01:00:55,458
He is the dumb witness, yes,

921
01:00:55,750 --> 01:01:00,083
but he speaks to Poirot
with a booming voice.

922
01:01:00,375 --> 01:01:01,458
Tell to me, madame,

923
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:03,374
after the accident
of Emily Arundel,

924
01:01:03,667 --> 01:01:04,916
which little Tanios
found the ball?

925
01:01:05,209 --> 01:01:07,958
- Young Katya.

926
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:12,249
- Upon the landing,
n'est-ce pas?

927
01:01:12,542 --> 01:01:16,583
Et bien, always, always
after his trick,

928
01:01:16,875 --> 01:01:19,916
Bob returns to his basket
this ball.

929
01:01:20,209 --> 01:01:24,083
Et bien, somebody moved it
on the night of the fall

930
01:01:24,375 --> 01:01:26,874
to make it seem stood upon.

931
01:01:34,667 --> 01:01:38,416
- You can move it to there
in an L shape.

932
01:01:38,709 --> 01:01:39,666
- Theresa, what is it?

933
01:01:39,959 --> 01:01:40,999
- Bella, dear,
we came for a chat.

934
01:01:41,292 --> 01:01:42,499
Is Jacob in?

935
01:01:42,792 --> 01:01:44,624
- Yes, come in.
- Children, to your rooms.

936
01:01:44,917 --> 01:01:46,291
I said go!

937
01:01:49,959 --> 01:01:53,249
- All right, off you go.

938
01:01:53,542 --> 01:01:56,833
- Jacob.
- Charles.

939
01:01:59,292 --> 01:02:00,624
- We'll speak freely,

940
01:02:00,917 --> 01:02:03,166
if that's all right by you,
about money.

941
01:02:03,459 --> 01:02:05,083
Money that's rightfully ours,

942
01:02:05,375 --> 01:02:08,541
left to Wilhemina
bloody Lawson.

943
01:02:08,834 --> 01:02:11,249
- Theresa's lawyer says
that we haven't got a claim,

944
01:02:11,542 --> 01:02:13,291
says that we ought to
butter up Wilhemina a bit

945
01:02:13,584 --> 01:02:15,749
so that she might leave us
a few quid.

946
01:02:16,042 --> 01:02:17,708
- I've always been nice to her
and to Aunt Em.

947
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,208
It's you two that got
her back up.

948
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:21,749
- Look, I say we forget
our differences

949
01:02:22,042 --> 01:02:23,666
and forget how she died,

950
01:02:23,959 --> 01:02:25,624
since it makes precious little
difference now.

951
01:02:25,917 --> 01:02:27,624
The fact is, she's gone.

952
01:02:27,917 --> 01:02:30,333
- And her estate is left
to Wilhemina.

953
01:02:30,625 --> 01:02:32,708
- So we just hand everything
over, do we?

954
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,083
To her and her
scheming doctor friend?

955
01:02:35,375 --> 01:02:37,041
- John Grainger
is a man of honor.

956
01:02:37,334 --> 01:02:38,791
He does not scheme.

957
01:02:39,084 --> 01:02:43,499
- Any fool knows that he and
Wilhemina are in this together.

958
01:02:43,792 --> 01:02:46,708
Now, what do you say, Bella?

959
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,791
Oh, for God's sake!
What are you looking at him for?

960
01:02:49,084 --> 01:02:52,583
Speak your own mind.

961
01:02:52,875 --> 01:02:54,874
- I just don't see what can be
done about it, that's all.

962
01:02:55,167 --> 01:02:57,166
- Theresa has got a plan
whereby we might recoup

963
01:02:57,459 --> 01:02:58,583
at least part of it.

964
01:02:58,875 --> 01:02:59,874
- No!

965
01:03:00,167 --> 01:03:01,249
We will not plot and plan
with you.

966
01:03:01,542 --> 01:03:03,624
Please, leave my house!

967
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:09,374
- Very well.

968
01:03:09,667 --> 01:03:13,458
Just don't expect a share
in the profits.

969
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:15,708
Will you?

970
01:03:29,375 --> 01:03:31,291
- Loyalty, Bella.

971
01:03:31,584 --> 01:03:35,208
Loyalty is everything.

972
01:03:39,042 --> 01:03:43,083
- So what can I do for you,
Poirot?

973
01:03:43,375 --> 01:03:45,083
- You can tell to me,
monsieur le docteur,

974
01:03:45,375 --> 01:03:48,333
why you were not
at the séance.

975
01:03:48,625 --> 01:03:49,916
- I neither believe
in such things

976
01:03:50,209 --> 01:03:51,541
nor do I approve of them.

977
01:03:51,834 --> 01:03:54,499
There is only one world,
the here and now.

978
01:03:54,792 --> 01:03:59,874
An accident of physics
with biochemical trimmings.

979
01:04:00,167 --> 01:04:01,874
- There is nothing beyond?

980
01:04:02,167 --> 01:04:04,041
- Nothing but wishful thinking.

981
01:04:04,334 --> 01:04:08,749
Highly dangerous.
Especially for dogs, I believe.

982
01:04:09,042 --> 01:04:10,666
When does Bob come for trial?

983
01:04:10,959 --> 01:04:13,666
- He does not, monsieur.

984
01:04:13,959 --> 01:04:16,791
I have proved him
to be innocent.

985
01:04:17,084 --> 01:04:18,666
But tell me,
Dr. Grainger,

986
01:04:18,959 --> 01:04:20,458
you, yourself, have treated
Emily Arundel

987
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:22,499
for the complaint of the liver,
n'est-ce pas?

988
01:04:22,792 --> 01:04:25,249
- Yes, with Exprotin

989
01:04:25,542 --> 01:04:27,833
and a mild sedative
occasionally.

990
01:04:28,125 --> 01:04:30,583
- And the liver capsules
that she took?

991
01:04:30,875 --> 01:04:32,333
- You can buy them
at any chemist.

992
01:04:32,625 --> 01:04:33,958
They'll do you no good.

993
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:35,374
Do you no harm, either.

994
01:04:35,667 --> 01:04:37,541
- I must see him.
It's really important!

995
01:04:37,834 --> 01:04:40,083
- But he has people with him.

996
01:04:40,375 --> 01:04:41,749
I'm sorry, Dr. Grainger.

997
01:04:42,042 --> 01:04:43,416
I did explain to Mrs. Tanios
that--

998
01:04:43,709 --> 01:04:44,958
- That's quite all right,
Mrs. Finch.

999
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:46,291
Thank you.

1000
01:04:46,584 --> 01:04:47,583
- Forgive me, John.
I'm sorry.

1001
01:04:47,875 --> 01:04:48,666
I thought you were alone.

1002
01:04:48,917 --> 01:04:51,249
- No, Madame Tanios,
we are leaving.

1003
01:04:51,542 --> 01:04:54,708
- No, no, Mr. Poirot.
Please stay.

1004
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,208
I was going to ask John to
tell you, anyway, about Jacob.

1005
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:59,791
- Bella, think carefully.
- No, it must come out!

1006
01:05:00,084 --> 01:05:02,166
Jacob preaches loyalty at me
all the time,

1007
01:05:02,459 --> 01:05:05,833
but what about my loyalty
to Aunt Em?

1008
01:05:06,125 --> 01:05:08,958
Please.

1009
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:11,583
- A brave decision, Bella.

1010
01:05:18,625 --> 01:05:20,874
Earlier this year,
I took Alexis and Katya

1011
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:23,291
sailing on Ullswater.

1012
01:05:23,584 --> 01:05:28,958
It was a scorching day,
so we had a swim before lunch.

1013
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:33,208
On his back,
Alexis had extensive bruising.

1014
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:35,624
I asked how he came by it.

1015
01:05:35,917 --> 01:05:38,666
I forget his exact reply.
Some excuse.

1016
01:05:38,959 --> 01:05:41,374
- Oh, um, some horseplay
at school, he said.

1017
01:05:41,667 --> 01:05:43,249
- Which you did not believe.

1018
01:05:43,542 --> 01:05:45,166
- No.

1019
01:05:45,459 --> 01:05:49,166
- That night,
I questioned Bella in private,

1020
01:05:49,459 --> 01:05:52,333
and she broke down.

1021
01:05:52,625 --> 01:05:54,666
The bruising on Alexis,
she told me,

1022
01:05:54,959 --> 01:05:59,333
was the result of his father
beating him.

1023
01:05:59,625 --> 01:06:02,041
- Good heavens.

1024
01:06:02,334 --> 01:06:07,166
- Well, this explains
why you fear him.

1025
01:06:07,459 --> 01:06:10,833
- More to the point, I think
he may have killed Aunt Emily.

1026
01:06:16,125 --> 01:06:20,458
- If the bruises on that boy's
back are anything to go by,

1027
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:25,708
I would say he is certainly
capable of it.

1028
01:06:27,084 --> 01:06:30,416
- I never liked him.
All that smiling the man does.

1029
01:06:30,709 --> 01:06:32,583
Now we learn he's
an absolute monster.

1030
01:06:32,875 --> 01:06:35,124
- No, no, no, Hastings.

1031
01:06:35,417 --> 01:06:38,916
We hear this, but as yet,
we have no proof

1032
01:06:39,209 --> 01:06:41,708
until we receive the analysis
from Scotland Yard.

1033
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,499
- Oh, the patent medicine,
you mean?

1034
01:06:43,792 --> 01:06:44,916
Yes.
In the meantime--

1035
01:06:45,209 --> 01:06:46,333
- In the meantime, Hastings,

1036
01:06:46,625 --> 01:06:50,041
have the patience and coffee
in the lounge.

1037
01:06:52,292 --> 01:06:54,499
- Oh, Captain?
- Something wrong, Walter?

1038
01:06:54,792 --> 01:06:55,958
- Heavens no, sir.

1039
01:06:56,250 --> 01:06:59,749
I just wonder if you,
being a friend of Mr. Charles,

1040
01:07:00,042 --> 01:07:01,249
wouldn't mind asking him

1041
01:07:01,542 --> 01:07:05,124
to give his club bill
some attention.

1042
01:07:05,417 --> 01:07:07,166
- You mean he hasn't paid it?

1043
01:07:07,459 --> 01:07:11,041
- I mean, sir, that it must have
slipped his mind.

1044
01:07:11,334 --> 01:07:13,791
- Monsieur, you do this task
every day?

1045
01:07:14,084 --> 01:07:16,458
- Filling the saltcellars?
- Oui.

1046
01:07:16,750 --> 01:07:18,666
- Depends how quickly
they get through them, sir.

1047
01:07:18,959 --> 01:07:24,416
Sometimes it's every couple
of days, sometimes a week.

1048
01:07:24,709 --> 01:07:25,791
Sometimes longer.

1049
01:07:26,084 --> 01:07:28,249
- Monsieur, you're a genius.

1050
01:08:57,875 --> 01:09:02,874
Sarah!

1051
01:09:03,167 --> 01:09:04,166
- What is it, Miss Lawson?

1052
01:09:04,459 --> 01:09:06,291
- Sarah,
there's someone downstairs.

1053
01:09:06,584 --> 01:09:07,541
They're trying to kill me!

1054
01:09:07,834 --> 01:09:09,583
- No!

1055
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:17,041
- There are two of them.
- Yes, miss.

1056
01:09:17,334 --> 01:09:20,124
I cannot make 'em out, though.

1057
01:09:38,709 --> 01:09:40,916
- Two people, says you.

1058
01:09:41,209 --> 01:09:42,958
Down by the water?

1059
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:45,541
So why is there no sign
of a break-in?

1060
01:09:45,834 --> 01:09:50,041
- All right, then, Keeley,
explain the fallen painting.

1061
01:09:50,334 --> 01:09:52,791
- Bad fixin', about to come down
sooner or later.

1062
01:09:53,084 --> 01:09:55,874
- There are things
going on here, Sergeant,

1063
01:09:56,167 --> 01:09:58,458
to do with Emily Arundels
death,

1064
01:09:58,750 --> 01:10:01,249
things beyond our control.

1065
01:10:01,542 --> 01:10:03,874
Poor General, he foresaw
all this, you know.

1066
01:10:04,167 --> 01:10:05,749
Evil.

1067
01:10:06,042 --> 01:10:08,041
- Yes, well, my superintendent

1068
01:10:08,334 --> 01:10:11,874
is more concerned
with earthly crimes.

1069
01:10:12,167 --> 01:10:14,333
I'll bid you good day.

1070
01:10:17,875 --> 01:10:19,124
Good morning, Mr. Poirot.

1071
01:10:19,417 --> 01:10:21,916
- Good morning to you,
Sergeant Keeley.

1072
01:10:26,084 --> 01:10:29,124
- Mr. Poirot,
thank you for coming.

1073
01:10:29,417 --> 01:10:31,333
- Madame.

1074
01:10:34,125 --> 01:10:35,166
- Why is he doing that?

1075
01:10:35,459 --> 01:10:37,999
- Because you threatened him
with the curtains.

1076
01:10:38,292 --> 01:10:40,083
- Didn't know
he spoke English.

1077
01:10:42,625 --> 01:10:46,208
- One does not have to speak
in order to know.

1078
01:10:48,625 --> 01:10:50,249
Tell me, Mademoiselle Sarah,

1079
01:10:50,542 --> 01:10:53,749
you opened the window,
you looked out--

1080
01:10:54,042 --> 01:10:55,416
what did you see?

1081
01:10:55,709 --> 01:11:00,458
- Two people running down the
garden, towards the lake, sir.

1082
01:11:00,750 --> 01:11:02,624
- Did they mean to kill me,
do you think?

1083
01:11:02,917 --> 01:11:03,749
- Et bien, madame,

1084
01:11:04,042 --> 01:11:05,249
it is a crime
which did not succeed,

1085
01:11:05,542 --> 01:11:09,249
and therefore the objective,
it is unknown.

1086
01:11:09,542 --> 01:11:11,833
- I think I should come and stay
for a few days, Poirot,

1087
01:11:12,125 --> 01:11:13,374
don't you?

1088
01:11:13,667 --> 01:11:15,499
I mean, if somebody is trying
to get at Wilhemina...

1089
01:11:15,792 --> 01:11:17,249
- That would be kind of you,
John.

1090
01:11:17,542 --> 01:11:20,499
I'd feel a great deal safer.

1091
01:11:20,792 --> 01:11:22,416
Good-bye.

1092
01:11:22,709 --> 01:11:26,041
- Good-bye.
- Au revoir, madame.

1093
01:11:28,667 --> 01:11:31,583
This Dr. Grainger, Hastings,
he is always at her side,

1094
01:11:31,875 --> 01:11:33,749
waiting for his chance
perhaps, huh?

1095
01:11:34,042 --> 01:11:36,666
- What about those two intruders
Miss Lawson talked about?

1096
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:39,374
This case has
many pairs, Hastings--

1097
01:11:39,667 --> 01:11:41,916
Charles and Theresa,
Bella and Jacob.

1098
01:11:42,209 --> 01:11:45,333
Uh, bien sûr this Jacob,
he bothers me.

1099
01:11:45,625 --> 01:11:47,749
- Because you know what
he's capable of, you mean.

1100
01:11:48,042 --> 01:11:49,666
- Because now I know
what is said of him.

1101
01:11:49,959 --> 01:11:50,916
- Good morning!
- Morning!

1102
01:11:51,209 --> 01:11:52,624
- Ah!
Bonjour.

1103
01:11:52,917 --> 01:11:56,458
- We just heard about the
break-in from Sergeant Keeley.

1104
01:11:56,750 --> 01:11:58,541
- Ah, the telegraph bush,
again?

1105
01:11:58,834 --> 01:12:00,749
- We're off to give
moral support.

1106
01:12:01,042 --> 01:12:03,791
- Ah.

1107
01:12:04,084 --> 01:12:07,833
Another pair, mon ami.

1108
01:12:08,125 --> 01:12:12,124
- The place we'd operate from
is Bonneville, Utah.

1109
01:12:12,417 --> 01:12:17,791
And as for facilities, Charles,
you'd never want for a thing.

1110
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:23,666
Of course, you might miss
your English weather.

1111
01:12:25,834 --> 01:12:29,416
Think it over.
- Fine.

1112
01:12:42,417 --> 01:12:44,041
- Hastings, a favor.

1113
01:12:44,334 --> 01:12:46,791
Whatever I should say,
you will nod in agreement.

1114
01:12:47,084 --> 01:12:50,374
- Did I ever do otherwise,
Poirot?

1115
01:12:50,667 --> 01:12:53,291
- Ah, Poirot, Battler,
good afternoon.

1116
01:12:53,584 --> 01:12:55,041
- Monsieur.
- The boat's fixed, by the way.

1117
01:12:55,334 --> 01:12:56,958
You can come down and have
a dekko some time.

1118
01:12:57,250 --> 01:12:58,124
Can I get you a drink?

1119
01:12:58,417 --> 01:13:02,416
- Non, non, non.
Merci beaucoup.

1120
01:13:02,709 --> 01:13:05,291
Tell me, the revoking
of the will of Aunt Emily,

1121
01:13:05,584 --> 01:13:06,499
your lawyer succeeds?

1122
01:13:06,792 --> 01:13:11,374
- No.
No, he jolly doesn't.

1123
01:13:11,667 --> 01:13:14,291
- Mes amis, I am one who knows
the law,

1124
01:13:14,584 --> 01:13:17,749
where and how it might be used
to your advantage.

1125
01:13:18,042 --> 01:13:20,083
Hastings, you remember
the Fairbank scandal?

1126
01:13:20,375 --> 01:13:22,708
On that occasion,
I, Hercule Poirot,

1127
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,291
stepped outside of the law

1128
01:13:24,584 --> 01:13:26,166
but only for the moment
very brief.

1129
01:13:26,459 --> 01:13:27,708
- So?

1130
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,208
- I might be able to do
the same again

1131
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:31,499
for a cause that is worthy.

1132
01:13:31,792 --> 01:13:33,333
- You mean you could get us
our money back?

1133
01:13:33,625 --> 01:13:34,874
- How can you do
what our lawyer can't?

1134
01:13:35,167 --> 01:13:36,666
- Oh, monsieur,
I merely say there are ways.

1135
01:13:36,959 --> 01:13:38,291
Allow me to pursue them.

1136
01:13:38,584 --> 01:13:40,666
But you yourselves
must do nothing, understand?

1137
01:13:40,959 --> 01:13:42,374
Nothing.

1138
01:13:42,667 --> 01:13:44,916
Because someone has already
broken into Littlegreen House.

1139
01:13:45,209 --> 01:13:46,291
- Really?
- Who?

1140
01:13:46,584 --> 01:13:51,166
- Ah, who indeed?
Another mystery.

1141
01:13:51,459 --> 01:13:53,374
Au revoir.

1142
01:14:06,417 --> 01:14:08,708
- What was the point of that,
saying you'd break the law?

1143
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,333
- They are young and foolish,
Hastings.

1144
01:14:10,625 --> 01:14:11,749
They are the hotheads.

1145
01:14:12,042 --> 01:14:13,249
I offer them
the crooked help

1146
01:14:13,542 --> 01:14:18,083
to prevent them doing things
that they will regret.

1147
01:14:18,375 --> 01:14:20,458
But there is something I've
meant to ask you, Hastings.

1148
01:14:20,750 --> 01:14:21,916
Your friend Monsieur Charles,

1149
01:14:22,209 --> 01:14:24,416
why does he give to you
the nickname of Battler?

1150
01:14:24,709 --> 01:14:27,874
- Oh, English humor, Poirot.

1151
01:14:28,167 --> 01:14:29,208
You wouldn't understand.

1152
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:32,708
- Poirot does not see a joke?
Au contraire.

1153
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,916
- Well, if you must know,
it's Battler,

1154
01:14:36,209 --> 01:14:39,416
as in Battle of Hastings.

1155
01:14:41,959 --> 01:14:43,749
Yes.

1156
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:48,166
- Thank you, Isabel.
- She's a very good host.

1157
01:14:48,459 --> 01:14:52,624
- Everyone has been so kind,
and I do so appreciate it.

1158
01:14:52,917 --> 01:14:53,958
- Not at all, dear.

1159
01:14:54,250 --> 01:14:56,374
- Lovely to see you,
Isabel, Julia.

1160
01:14:56,667 --> 01:14:58,708
- And thank you for your help.

1161
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,499
- Come along, dear.

1162
01:15:05,125 --> 01:15:08,958
I thought they'd never go.

1163
01:15:11,584 --> 01:15:13,499
Thank you for moving in with us,
John,

1164
01:15:13,792 --> 01:15:14,833
but people will talk.

1165
01:15:15,125 --> 01:15:16,583
- But only behind our backs,
my dear.

1166
01:15:16,875 --> 01:15:18,916
How can that harm us?

1167
01:15:19,209 --> 01:15:22,749
- That's where she fell.

1168
01:15:23,042 --> 01:15:24,416
- Poor Emily.

1169
01:15:24,709 --> 01:15:26,249
I did admire her spirit,
you know,

1170
01:15:26,542 --> 01:15:28,916
her strength of character.

1171
01:15:29,209 --> 01:15:33,958
- Why do you suppose
the human spirit is green?

1172
01:15:34,250 --> 01:15:36,666
White would have been
a better color, surely.

1173
01:15:36,959 --> 01:15:40,874
Or even red, not green.

1174
01:15:41,167 --> 01:15:44,208
Because our oneness
with the Earth, perhaps.

1175
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:47,124
- It's certainly
an interesting thought.

1176
01:15:47,417 --> 01:15:51,333
- I saw Emily's spirit the night
she died, leaving her body.

1177
01:15:51,625 --> 01:15:56,458
Streaming out of her mouth,
floating away.

1178
01:15:56,750 --> 01:15:59,749
- Green?
From her mouth?

1179
01:16:04,584 --> 01:16:07,999
Bella, John Grainger.
Is Jacob there?

1180
01:16:08,292 --> 01:16:09,249
- He's not home yet.

1181
01:16:09,542 --> 01:16:10,583
He's at a meeting
of the faculty.

1182
01:16:10,875 --> 01:16:11,666
Can I help?

1183
01:16:11,959 --> 01:16:12,916
- Strange question--

1184
01:16:13,209 --> 01:16:15,374
do you know if he has
a flask of phosphorus?

1185
01:16:15,667 --> 01:16:17,958
I think that Emily
may have been given some.

1186
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:19,999
- Phosphorus?
Who says?

1187
01:16:20,292 --> 01:16:22,166
- A bit of a hunch,
that's all.

1188
01:16:22,459 --> 01:16:23,749
Something Wilhemina said.

1189
01:16:24,042 --> 01:16:27,458
I'm camping down here
at Littlegreen, you see.

1190
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:29,124
- Is phosphorus dangerous?

1191
01:16:29,417 --> 01:16:31,124
I mean, they make matches
out of it, don't they?

1192
01:16:31,417 --> 01:16:32,458
And fertilizers?

1193
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:35,249
- That's right, dear.

1194
01:16:35,542 --> 01:16:37,624
- And you're saying
she was given some?

1195
01:16:37,917 --> 01:16:39,041
By Jacob?

1196
01:16:39,334 --> 01:16:40,916
- I'm not saying anything yet.

1197
01:16:41,209 --> 01:16:44,958
I'm just asking if he has
any phosphorus, that's all.

1198
01:16:45,250 --> 01:16:46,916
- I don't know.

1199
01:16:47,209 --> 01:16:49,833
- Right.
Best not tell him I rang.

1200
01:16:50,125 --> 01:16:53,041
I'll speak to him tomorrow.

1201
01:16:56,542 --> 01:17:00,083
Those look delicious, my dear.

1202
01:17:13,917 --> 01:17:16,749
- Who was that, Bella?

1203
01:17:17,042 --> 01:17:19,666
- John Grainger.
- What did he want?

1204
01:17:19,959 --> 01:17:22,541
- Nothing.
- You tell me now!

1205
01:17:22,834 --> 01:17:24,541
What did he want?

1206
01:18:56,084 --> 01:18:57,208
Help!
Help!

1207
01:19:02,542 --> 01:19:04,124
Oh!

1208
01:19:21,125 --> 01:19:23,874
- Dr. Grainger?

1209
01:19:26,542 --> 01:19:27,374
You all right, Doctor?

1210
01:19:27,667 --> 01:19:28,999
- What is it, Sarah?

1211
01:19:29,292 --> 01:19:33,249
- Gas, Mrs. Lawson.
Dr. Grainger's room.

1212
01:19:33,542 --> 01:19:35,374
John!

1213
01:20:05,834 --> 01:20:07,916
John...

1214
01:20:30,667 --> 01:20:33,583
- Well, Mr. Poirot, you can't go
digging up bodies,

1215
01:20:33,875 --> 01:20:36,124
but I would like to know more
about Mrs. Emily's death.

1216
01:20:36,417 --> 01:20:37,291
Two in a row
in the same house

1217
01:20:37,584 --> 01:20:39,208
is a bit much
for these parts.

1218
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:41,124
- Later, Sergeant.

1219
01:20:41,417 --> 01:20:43,999
Tell to me, if you please,
what has happened here.

1220
01:20:44,292 --> 01:20:46,166
- This way, sir.

1221
01:20:48,542 --> 01:20:50,333
Gas filled
Dr. Grainger's room.

1222
01:20:50,625 --> 01:20:53,124
He died of carbon monoxide
poisoning.

1223
01:20:53,417 --> 01:20:55,458
Terrible business.

1224
01:21:10,792 --> 01:21:12,499
- Madam?

1225
01:21:15,667 --> 01:21:18,916
- You have my condolences,
madame.

1226
01:21:19,209 --> 01:21:23,666
- Why would anyone
want to kill John?

1227
01:21:23,959 --> 01:21:26,833
He was a doctor.

1228
01:21:27,125 --> 01:21:30,458
- Even they have their enemies.

1229
01:21:30,750 --> 01:21:34,291
- Was it the same people who
broke in the night before, sir?

1230
01:21:34,584 --> 01:21:36,416
- Perhaps.

1231
01:21:43,292 --> 01:21:47,541
Madame, if you'd be so kind
as to tell me,

1232
01:21:47,834 --> 01:21:50,624
did you see anyone
last night?

1233
01:21:50,917 --> 01:21:56,541
Or did anyone call at the house
or perhaps telephone?

1234
01:21:56,834 --> 01:22:04,583
- The Tripps left after 8:00,
but no one called.

1235
01:22:04,875 --> 01:22:08,333
John telephoned out later,

1236
01:22:08,625 --> 01:22:10,083
to Jacob.

1237
01:22:10,375 --> 01:22:12,541
- Did he say why?

1238
01:22:12,834 --> 01:22:15,833
- I'm sorry.

1239
01:22:16,125 --> 01:22:19,749
He mentioned something
about phosphorus.

1240
01:22:20,042 --> 01:22:23,874
That's all I heard.

1241
01:22:24,167 --> 01:22:26,833
- Merci.

1242
01:22:27,125 --> 01:22:29,874
Once again, my sympathy.

1243
01:22:45,834 --> 01:22:47,249
- Wait there.

1244
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,249
- Forgive me, madame.

1245
01:22:53,542 --> 01:22:54,583
- I thought you were Jacob.

1246
01:22:54,875 --> 01:22:56,833
Children,
take this to the car.

1247
01:22:57,125 --> 01:22:58,416
I'm leaving him.

1248
01:22:58,709 --> 01:23:00,374
I cannot let my children live
with a murderer.

1249
01:23:00,667 --> 01:23:02,333
- You have heard then about
Dr. John Grainger?

1250
01:23:02,625 --> 01:23:03,541
From whom?

1251
01:23:03,834 --> 01:23:05,583
- Sarah, the Arundel maid.
I rang earlier.

1252
01:23:05,875 --> 01:23:07,374
Why should Jacob
kill John Grainger?

1253
01:23:07,667 --> 01:23:09,208
- He telephoned here last night,
I believe,

1254
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:10,416
to ask about the phosphorus.

1255
01:23:10,709 --> 01:23:11,958
- He spoke to me.

1256
01:23:12,250 --> 01:23:14,083
He asked me if Jacob had any,
and I said I didn't know.

1257
01:23:14,375 --> 01:23:15,749
- And you reported this
to your husband?

1258
01:23:16,042 --> 01:23:17,333
- He demanded to know
what had been said.

1259
01:23:17,625 --> 01:23:19,874
You see, he came in just as I
was putting the telephone down.

1260
01:23:20,167 --> 01:23:24,833
Mr. Poirot,
I am so frightened.

1261
01:23:25,125 --> 01:23:26,916
- So you leave him.

1262
01:23:27,209 --> 01:23:28,791
But where do you go, madame?

1263
01:23:29,084 --> 01:23:31,124
- I don't know.

1264
01:23:35,250 --> 01:23:37,708
- Then let us take you
to a place of safety.

1265
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,374
Vite.

1266
01:23:45,375 --> 01:23:47,708
- Into the car, Alexi.
You too, Katya.

1267
01:23:52,875 --> 01:23:55,958
- Hey!
Poirot, what's happening?

1268
01:23:56,250 --> 01:23:57,499
- Vite, mon ami!
Vite!

1269
01:23:57,792 --> 01:24:00,083
- Where are we going?
- The sisters Tripp, mon ami.

1270
01:24:03,667 --> 01:24:06,333
- Bella!
Stop!

1271
01:24:41,209 --> 01:24:43,041
- Mesdames,
I have for you a task.

1272
01:24:43,334 --> 01:24:45,583
I would like Madame Tanios
and her two children

1273
01:24:45,875 --> 01:24:49,458
to stay here for a while,
away from Monsieur Jacob.

1274
01:24:49,750 --> 01:24:51,791
- It's him, isn't it?
It's Jacob.

1275
01:24:52,084 --> 01:24:54,999
- He killed Emily
and then, later, John Grainger.

1276
01:24:55,292 --> 01:24:56,499
- Calm yourselves,
I beseech you,

1277
01:24:56,792 --> 01:24:58,624
for the great task
ahead of you:

1278
01:24:58,917 --> 01:24:59,874
to keep the presence here

1279
01:25:00,167 --> 01:25:02,333
of madame and her two children
a secret.

1280
01:25:02,625 --> 01:25:04,958
- Yes, of course.

1281
01:25:05,250 --> 01:25:09,416
Bella, why don't you put
your things in the spare room?

1282
01:25:09,709 --> 01:25:12,749
- Thank you,
both of you.

1283
01:25:13,042 --> 01:25:14,291
- Merci.

1284
01:25:17,042 --> 01:25:21,083
I have yet another favor
to ask of you, mesdames.

1285
01:25:21,375 --> 01:25:23,333
Monsieur--
Merci.

1286
01:25:23,625 --> 01:25:25,874
Monsieur Bob,
he is a person--

1287
01:25:26,167 --> 01:25:29,249
pardon, he is a dog of
the country and not of the town.

1288
01:25:29,542 --> 01:25:34,333
And I seek for him the good home
when my work here, it is done.

1289
01:25:34,625 --> 01:25:39,666
- I'm sorry, Mr. Poirot,
but we couldn't possibly.

1290
01:25:39,959 --> 01:25:42,041
It's Albert, you see,
he wouldn't like it.

1291
01:25:42,334 --> 01:25:44,791
- Albert?
- Our own dog.

1292
01:25:45,084 --> 01:25:47,499
A springer spaniel.

1293
01:25:47,792 --> 01:25:52,124
Bob would put his nose
out of joint, rather.

1294
01:25:52,417 --> 01:25:53,458
- Huh.

1295
01:25:53,750 --> 01:25:55,458
I did not know
that you had a pet dog.

1296
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:57,708
A pet spirit.

1297
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:02,666
- Albert himself crossed over
three years ago.

1298
01:26:02,959 --> 01:26:04,749
- They're just unpacking
a few things.

1299
01:26:05,042 --> 01:26:06,124
They'll be down in a moment.

1300
01:26:06,417 --> 01:26:07,999
- Santé.

1301
01:26:15,667 --> 01:26:18,208
It is you who row the boat
in this photograph, madame?

1302
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:21,874
- Yes, we used to keep
a little dinghy on Windermere

1303
01:26:22,167 --> 01:26:26,416
for getting about.

1304
01:26:26,709 --> 01:26:28,624
- You say that you were at
Littlegreen House last night

1305
01:26:28,917 --> 01:26:30,249
until 8:00?

1306
01:26:30,542 --> 01:26:31,833
Yes.

1307
01:26:32,125 --> 01:26:33,624
You can never get away
from Minnie.

1308
01:26:33,917 --> 01:26:36,833
Talk, talk, talk.

1309
01:26:37,125 --> 01:26:39,624
- And on the night of the death
of Emily Arundel,

1310
01:26:39,917 --> 01:26:43,583
you were also at the house?

1311
01:26:43,875 --> 01:26:47,458
- Well, yes.

1312
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:48,666
- Then both of these deaths

1313
01:26:48,959 --> 01:26:50,249
have in common
the same three people:

1314
01:26:50,542 --> 01:26:52,541
Wilhemina Lawson
and yourselves.

1315
01:26:52,834 --> 01:26:56,291
- You think we had something
to do with it, Mr. Poirot?

1316
01:26:56,584 --> 01:27:00,791
- You mean we're suspects?

1317
01:27:01,084 --> 01:27:05,208
Oh, how thrilling.

1318
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:08,291
- Go on, question us,
Mr. Poirot.

1319
01:27:08,584 --> 01:27:11,458
Just like you would
normal people.

1320
01:27:13,459 --> 01:27:17,249
- I will, madame.

1321
01:27:17,542 --> 01:27:19,708
But not today.

1322
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:32,874
- Hello.

1323
01:27:33,167 --> 01:27:35,708
- A telegram for you, sir.
- Thank you.

1324
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,416
Hastings, at last.
There will be no reply.

1325
01:27:38,709 --> 01:27:40,333
- Can I get you anything, sir?
- Oui.

1326
01:27:40,625 --> 01:27:43,916
A coffee for one and, for me,
tisane, near the window.

1327
01:27:44,209 --> 01:27:47,874
- Certainly, sir.

1328
01:27:48,167 --> 01:27:51,499
- Excuse me.
- No! I will pass.

1329
01:27:51,792 --> 01:27:54,708
Where is she, Poirot?

1330
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,458
- Calm yourself, Dr. Tanios.

1331
01:27:56,750 --> 01:27:58,166
- You take my wife and children
from me

1332
01:27:58,459 --> 01:28:01,541
and tell me to be calm?

1333
01:28:01,834 --> 01:28:06,874
- Your wife has left you
of her own free will, Doctor.

1334
01:28:07,167 --> 01:28:09,499
I have here a telegram
from Scotland Yard.

1335
01:28:09,792 --> 01:28:10,958
It contains the analysis

1336
01:28:11,250 --> 01:28:16,749
of the patent medicine that you
gave to Aunt Emily Arundel.

1337
01:28:17,042 --> 01:28:19,374
Do you want me
to read it here?

1338
01:28:21,875 --> 01:28:26,374
- Damn you and your
dreamt up evidence, Poirot.

1339
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:33,208
- I'll telephone
Sergeant Keeley.

1340
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:35,999
- No, no, no.
Not yet, Hastings.

1341
01:28:39,667 --> 01:28:42,541
Bob and I,
we need time to think.

1342
01:28:45,042 --> 01:28:48,041
- Thanks.

1343
01:28:48,334 --> 01:28:52,624
- By the way, the steward
at the club, old Walter,

1344
01:28:52,917 --> 01:28:54,458
said you wanted
to have a word with me.

1345
01:28:54,750 --> 01:28:56,541
- Really?

1346
01:28:56,834 --> 01:28:58,958
- Yes, lunchtime.

1347
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:02,208
Brought the chitty over
for me to sign and said,

1348
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:04,666
"Ah.
That reminds me."

1349
01:29:04,959 --> 01:29:06,999
- Oh, yes.

1350
01:29:07,292 --> 01:29:10,708
I reckon you'd forgotten
to pay your bill.

1351
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,374
A trivial thing.

1352
01:29:16,292 --> 01:29:19,708
- Clean slipped my mind.

1353
01:29:24,167 --> 01:29:26,624
- This polish buffs up
to a marvelous shine, Charlie.

1354
01:29:26,917 --> 01:29:28,041
What is it?

1355
01:29:28,334 --> 01:29:33,749
- Yes, I mix it up myself,
from phosphorus.

1356
01:29:34,042 --> 01:29:35,458
- Phosphorus?

1357
01:29:44,459 --> 01:29:46,833
- Your mistress, little Bob,
was murdered for her fortune.

1358
01:29:47,125 --> 01:29:48,708
Dr. Grainger,
he was killed

1359
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,999
in order to keep a secret
that was already out.

1360
01:29:52,292 --> 01:29:53,624
The "whys"
and the "wherefores,"

1361
01:29:53,917 --> 01:29:55,333
these are known to me.

1362
01:29:55,625 --> 01:29:59,541
But the "who," mon petit,
that still to me is a puzzle.

1363
01:29:59,834 --> 01:30:01,624
But it does not puzzle you.

1364
01:30:01,917 --> 01:30:04,916
You knew from the first day.

1365
01:30:05,209 --> 01:30:09,916
And so, if you please,
I ask you now to tell me.

1366
01:30:11,292 --> 01:30:13,958
- I say, Poirot,
you know you said you thought

1367
01:30:14,250 --> 01:30:16,666
phosphorus
had something to do with it.

1368
01:30:19,250 --> 01:30:20,333
- Monsieur Bob!

1369
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,583
- Qu'est que c'est,
mon petit?

1370
01:30:35,959 --> 01:30:38,083
Mon Dieu!

1371
01:30:38,375 --> 01:30:41,291
I swear to you, Bob, there
is within you a Belgian blood.

1372
01:30:41,584 --> 01:30:42,708
- What's he told you now?

1373
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,374
- He has told to me all.

1374
01:30:44,667 --> 01:30:48,666
Tomorrow morning, Hastings,
Bob and I, we catch our fox

1375
01:30:48,959 --> 01:30:52,416
and bring upon him terror.

1376
01:31:08,667 --> 01:31:10,833
- Why don't we start, Poirot?

1377
01:31:11,125 --> 01:31:13,374
He probably won't show up
anyhow.

1378
01:31:16,584 --> 01:31:21,791
- Monsieur Jacob will be here.
Of that I guarantee.

1379
01:31:29,459 --> 01:31:31,874
- Bella,
tell me what's going on.

1380
01:31:32,167 --> 01:31:33,333
Where are the children?

1381
01:31:33,625 --> 01:31:36,749
- If you'd like to take a seat
over here, sir.

1382
01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:03,374
- Mesdames et messieurs,

1383
01:32:03,667 --> 01:32:07,583
among us today
is the murderer

1384
01:32:07,875 --> 01:32:10,499
of Dr. John Grainger
and Emily Arundel.

1385
01:32:10,792 --> 01:32:12,874
- Would that be one
in the same person, sir?

1386
01:32:13,167 --> 01:32:16,916
- Have patience, if you please,
Sergeant Keeley.

1387
01:32:17,209 --> 01:32:22,708
You believed--
all of you except one believed

1388
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:27,583
that the fall of Emily Arundel
was an accident.

1389
01:32:27,875 --> 01:32:30,333
If so,

1390
01:32:30,625 --> 01:32:32,666
who was the person on the stairs
the night before the fall

1391
01:32:32,959 --> 01:32:35,083
and what were they
doing there?

1392
01:32:35,375 --> 01:32:39,666
I say that this person placed
in the skirting a screw eye

1393
01:32:39,959 --> 01:32:45,749
to which a cord was attached
to form a trip wire.

1394
01:32:46,042 --> 01:32:48,458
Wilhemina Lawson
saw this person,

1395
01:32:48,750 --> 01:32:50,583
or, to be precise,

1396
01:32:50,875 --> 01:32:54,041
she saw the monogram on the
dressing gown that they wore--

1397
01:32:54,334 --> 01:32:57,124
the letters T.A.

1398
01:32:57,417 --> 01:33:00,291
And she assumed it was
Theresa Arundel.

1399
01:33:00,584 --> 01:33:02,249
- Minnie Lawson's
never liked me.

1400
01:33:02,542 --> 01:33:04,916
It's just her style
to accuse me of murder.

1401
01:33:05,209 --> 01:33:07,708
- While she went off
with Aunt Em's fortune.

1402
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:11,833
- But Emily fell.
She told me so herself.

1403
01:33:12,125 --> 01:33:14,208
She stood on Bob's ball,
and she fell.

1404
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:15,916
- Non, madame.

1405
01:33:16,209 --> 01:33:18,124
But how do I know this?

1406
01:33:18,417 --> 01:33:20,916
From Monsieur Bob himself.

1407
01:33:24,334 --> 01:33:26,958
Every time he performed
his trick,

1408
01:33:27,250 --> 01:33:30,041
Bob was telling to me
the answer.

1409
01:33:32,959 --> 01:33:35,541
Always, always
after his trick,

1410
01:33:35,834 --> 01:33:38,208
Bob returned his ball
to his basket.

1411
01:33:43,959 --> 01:33:46,083
And when I found out
that little Katya Tanios

1412
01:33:46,375 --> 01:33:47,583
discovered the ball
on the landing

1413
01:33:47,875 --> 01:33:48,958
on the night of the fall,

1414
01:33:49,250 --> 01:33:51,291
I knew that it had been
placed there

1415
01:33:51,584 --> 01:33:54,833
to make it seem like
an accident.

1416
01:33:58,542 --> 01:34:01,041
For the cause of the fall
of Emily Arundel

1417
01:34:01,334 --> 01:34:03,416
was a trip wire.

1418
01:34:03,709 --> 01:34:04,708
- Ah!

1419
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,041
Oh!

1420
01:34:15,042 --> 01:34:16,166
- But it was not this

1421
01:34:16,459 --> 01:34:18,624
that was the cause of the death
of your aunt, no.

1422
01:34:18,917 --> 01:34:20,624
Because after the fall,
your aunt was bruised,

1423
01:34:20,917 --> 01:34:22,166
but she was still alive.

1424
01:34:22,459 --> 01:34:25,124
So our murderer tried again

1425
01:34:25,417 --> 01:34:29,041
and, this time, succeeded.

1426
01:34:31,209 --> 01:34:35,291
I believe that the death
of your aunt was caused

1427
01:34:35,584 --> 01:34:39,083
by being poisoned
with phosphorus.

1428
01:34:39,375 --> 01:34:43,749
- If I'd wanted liver capsules,
I should have said so.

1429
01:34:44,042 --> 01:34:45,541
- On the night of her death,

1430
01:34:45,834 --> 01:34:48,458
Emily must have ingested
unwittingly

1431
01:34:48,750 --> 01:34:51,666
some of this deadly substance.

1432
01:34:51,959 --> 01:34:55,458
- Jacob gave it to me
earlier today.

1433
01:34:55,750 --> 01:34:59,624
- I believe this
and so too did Dr. Grainger.

1434
01:34:59,917 --> 01:35:01,166
Being a man of science,

1435
01:35:01,459 --> 01:35:03,874
he knew of the many uses,
the many forms of phosphorus,

1436
01:35:04,167 --> 01:35:08,208
all of which produce a poison.

1437
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:11,791
He made a telephone call
to Madame Tanios

1438
01:35:12,084 --> 01:35:13,874
to ask if her husband
had some of this substance.

1439
01:35:14,167 --> 01:35:17,333
This telephone call,
it was meant to be a secret,

1440
01:35:17,625 --> 01:35:20,791
but Jacob Tanios demanded
to know what had been said.

1441
01:35:21,084 --> 01:35:24,874
- Maybe so, but Emily did not
die at my hand.

1442
01:35:26,542 --> 01:35:29,458
- Non, monsieur?

1443
01:35:29,750 --> 01:35:31,708
Et bien.

1444
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:39,916
I have here a telegram
from Scotland Yard

1445
01:35:40,209 --> 01:35:43,416
which tells to me
that the patent medicine

1446
01:35:43,709 --> 01:35:47,124
that Jacob Tanios gave
to Emily Arundel...

1447
01:35:47,417 --> 01:35:49,124
Non, monsieur!

1448
01:35:49,417 --> 01:35:53,624
Is harmless.

1449
01:35:59,542 --> 01:36:02,458
And so now I ask,
who poisoned her?

1450
01:36:05,584 --> 01:36:07,541
Dr. John Grainger
with his medicines?

1451
01:36:07,834 --> 01:36:09,333
Non.

1452
01:36:09,625 --> 01:36:11,708
Un medicament, docteur?

1453
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:15,041
For he himself was soon
to become a victim.

1454
01:36:15,334 --> 01:36:19,749
So where else could be
discovered this phosphorus?

1455
01:36:20,042 --> 01:36:22,374
I suggest, mes amis,

1456
01:36:22,667 --> 01:36:26,499
in a liver capsule
that was placed in this box

1457
01:36:26,792 --> 01:36:31,499
that was always by the side
of Emily Arundel.

1458
01:36:31,792 --> 01:36:33,874
This also answers for me
a question most puzzling.

1459
01:36:34,167 --> 01:36:37,624
Why was she murdered
after the changing of the will?

1460
01:36:37,917 --> 01:36:39,499
Mesdames et messieurs,
I can now reveal to you

1461
01:36:39,792 --> 01:36:41,833
that she was murdered before.

1462
01:36:42,125 --> 01:36:44,249
- Murdered three days
before she died?

1463
01:36:44,542 --> 01:36:45,708
Clever!

1464
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,708
- Oui, and it was
the steward at your club,

1465
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,833
Monsieur Charles,
who showed to me how.

1466
01:36:51,125 --> 01:36:54,583
One of his lesser duties
was to refill the saltcellars.

1467
01:36:54,875 --> 01:36:57,083
Would they be empty today,
tomorrow, three days after that,

1468
01:36:57,375 --> 01:36:58,416
who could tell?

1469
01:36:58,709 --> 01:37:01,999
It would depend upon the persons
who use them.

1470
01:37:02,292 --> 01:37:05,583
And so is it not possible

1471
01:37:05,875 --> 01:37:07,958
for our murderer...

1472
01:37:13,209 --> 01:37:15,916
To fill
a liver capsule...

1473
01:37:20,750 --> 01:37:22,999
With a phosphorus...

1474
01:37:27,667 --> 01:37:30,874
Which Emily Arundel
would take today, tomorrow,

1475
01:37:31,167 --> 01:37:34,166
or the day after that?

1476
01:37:34,459 --> 01:37:36,708
After her death, we concentrated
our attention

1477
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,958
on the patent medicine
of Jacob Tanios.

1478
01:37:39,250 --> 01:37:40,624
But I believe on the night
that she died,

1479
01:37:40,917 --> 01:37:42,416
she must also have taken
the liver capsule

1480
01:37:42,709 --> 01:37:48,541
which slowly released its poison
and killed her.

1481
01:37:48,834 --> 01:37:50,499
The liver capsules
of Emily Arundel

1482
01:37:50,792 --> 01:37:52,333
were always within easy reach,

1483
01:37:52,625 --> 01:37:56,958
and so it would have been simple
for anyone to tamper with them.

1484
01:37:57,250 --> 01:37:58,958
The patent medicine she took

1485
01:37:59,250 --> 01:38:01,666
on the night of her death
confused us.

1486
01:38:01,959 --> 01:38:04,333
In fact, the phosphorus
from the capsule

1487
01:38:04,625 --> 01:38:07,916
was creating a lethal chemical
reaction within her body

1488
01:38:08,209 --> 01:38:11,124
which emanated from her
in the form of a green vapor

1489
01:38:11,417 --> 01:38:15,833
thought by some to be
her spirit leaving her body.

1490
01:38:18,375 --> 01:38:21,499
And then came the reading
of the will, huh?

1491
01:38:21,792 --> 01:38:25,708
The family did not like
what it said, non, non,

1492
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,624
for all of the fortune
of Emily Arundel

1493
01:38:27,917 --> 01:38:29,416
was to go to Wilhemina Lawson.

1494
01:38:29,709 --> 01:38:32,874
- So they turned their attention
to her?

1495
01:38:33,167 --> 01:38:35,374
- Bien sûr.

1496
01:38:35,667 --> 01:38:39,499
Then two people
broke into this house.

1497
01:38:43,709 --> 01:38:47,749
The general prevented
their crime by falling.

1498
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:53,583
Sarah!
Sarah!

1499
01:38:58,167 --> 01:39:00,833
- And from the window, Wilhemina
Lawson and Mademoiselle Sarah

1500
01:39:01,125 --> 01:39:03,083
saw these two people making
their escape from the house,

1501
01:39:03,375 --> 01:39:06,916
but they could not make out
who they were.

1502
01:39:07,209 --> 01:39:10,916
I, Hercule Poirot, of course,
know.

1503
01:39:24,959 --> 01:39:26,499
Monsieur Charles

1504
01:39:26,792 --> 01:39:29,166
and your sister,
Mademoiselle Theresa.

1505
01:39:29,459 --> 01:39:30,916
You broke into this house

1506
01:39:31,209 --> 01:39:35,124
to steal what you thought
was yours by right.

1507
01:39:35,417 --> 01:39:38,458
- Yes, but that was our
one and only attempt, Poirot.

1508
01:39:38,750 --> 01:39:41,124
- And we certainly didn't
come back the night after.

1509
01:39:41,417 --> 01:39:43,041
- But someone did,

1510
01:39:43,334 --> 01:39:44,958
in order to murder
John Grainger,

1511
01:39:45,250 --> 01:39:46,458
who, on that very evening,

1512
01:39:46,750 --> 01:39:48,749
had begun to make the discovery
of the phosphorus.

1513
01:39:49,042 --> 01:39:51,208
- Same person that murdered
Emily, you think?

1514
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:53,041
- Oui.

1515
01:39:53,334 --> 01:39:55,833
- This T.A. person, then.

1516
01:39:56,125 --> 01:39:57,291
- I've had just about enough
of this.

1517
01:39:57,584 --> 01:40:01,416
- Sit down, miss.

1518
01:40:01,709 --> 01:40:02,874
- Mesdames et messieurs,

1519
01:40:03,167 --> 01:40:06,083
if you would please to observe
in the mirror.

1520
01:40:06,375 --> 01:40:07,458
It was Monsieur Bob

1521
01:40:07,750 --> 01:40:10,458
who first drew
this curiosity to my attention

1522
01:40:10,750 --> 01:40:12,291
when he barked at
his reflection

1523
01:40:12,584 --> 01:40:14,083
in the highly polished surface
of the boat

1524
01:40:14,375 --> 01:40:19,041
until he was sure
that I understood.

1525
01:40:19,334 --> 01:40:22,291
Wilhemina Lawson saw the person
on the landing in her mirror.

1526
01:40:22,584 --> 01:40:25,541
And she also saw
in reflection

1527
01:40:25,834 --> 01:40:32,083
the monogram
with the letters T.A.

1528
01:40:34,250 --> 01:40:38,249
And now,
mesdames et messieurs,

1529
01:40:38,542 --> 01:40:41,249
you will observe
that these letters,

1530
01:40:41,542 --> 01:40:44,041
without the reflection,

1531
01:40:44,334 --> 01:40:49,958
are now changed to A.T.,

1532
01:40:50,250 --> 01:40:55,166
the initials
of Arabella Tanios.

1533
01:41:00,417 --> 01:41:01,416
It was you, madame,

1534
01:41:01,709 --> 01:41:04,208
whom Wilhemina Lawson
saw on the landing.

1535
01:41:04,500 --> 01:41:08,624
- Put him in his basket
before he wakes the whole house.

1536
01:41:10,917 --> 01:41:12,416
- Not dead, is she?

1537
01:41:12,709 --> 01:41:14,166
- It was you who placed
the trip wire

1538
01:41:14,459 --> 01:41:19,416
and then removed it
after the fall.

1539
01:41:19,709 --> 01:41:22,958
It was you who took the ball
belonging to Bob

1540
01:41:23,250 --> 01:41:24,458
and placed it close
to the top stair

1541
01:41:24,750 --> 01:41:26,499
for the purpose
of incriminating him.

1542
01:41:26,792 --> 01:41:29,791
And it was you who murdered
Dr. John Grainger

1543
01:41:30,084 --> 01:41:31,416
for what he suspected.

1544
01:41:40,625 --> 01:41:42,624
- Is this true, Bella?

1545
01:41:42,917 --> 01:41:45,124
- No.

1546
01:41:45,417 --> 01:41:47,666
You know how brutal he is!

1547
01:41:47,959 --> 01:41:49,583
You know how he beats
my children!

1548
01:41:49,875 --> 01:41:50,749
- Bella!

1549
01:41:51,042 --> 01:41:52,874
- I know that is what you say,
madame.

1550
01:41:53,167 --> 01:41:54,791
Always you point the finger.

1551
01:41:55,084 --> 01:41:56,833
You play out the charade
of fearing him.

1552
01:41:57,125 --> 01:41:58,749
You tell us of his temper
most wicked.

1553
01:41:59,042 --> 01:42:01,083
All are lies!

1554
01:42:01,375 --> 01:42:02,791
For you and you alone
are responsible

1555
01:42:03,084 --> 01:42:04,458
for the murder
of Dr. John Grainger

1556
01:42:04,750 --> 01:42:07,583
and, before him,
Aunt Emily Arundel.

1557
01:42:16,459 --> 01:42:18,083
- Why, Bella?

1558
01:42:18,375 --> 01:42:20,249
Why?

1559
01:42:20,542 --> 01:42:22,458
- Because I hate you, Jacob.

1560
01:42:22,750 --> 01:42:25,791
- Hate me?
You hate me, Bella?

1561
01:42:26,084 --> 01:42:29,708
- You were different once,
and I loved you for that.

1562
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,333
But then people here
shunned you,

1563
01:42:31,625 --> 01:42:33,958
and you started to change
just to please them.

1564
01:42:34,250 --> 01:42:36,916
And I felt so ashamed.

1565
01:42:37,209 --> 01:42:39,083
Now all you want to do
is crawl away,

1566
01:42:39,375 --> 01:42:41,249
back to your homeland.

1567
01:42:41,542 --> 01:42:43,208
How could you be so weak?

1568
01:42:43,500 --> 01:42:46,208
What is there for me
in Greece?

1569
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:48,458
With my inheritance
from Aunt Emily,

1570
01:42:48,750 --> 01:42:50,249
I could have lived here
with my children

1571
01:42:50,542 --> 01:42:52,749
and held my head high again.

1572
01:42:53,042 --> 01:42:54,208
If only she had done me
the courtesy

1573
01:42:54,500 --> 01:42:56,583
of dying after the accident,
I would have had inherited.

1574
01:42:56,875 --> 01:42:58,958
You too, Charles.
You, Theresa.

1575
01:43:02,500 --> 01:43:04,541
And if you hadn't meddled,
Mr. Poirot,

1576
01:43:04,834 --> 01:43:06,166
she wouldn't have changed
her will,

1577
01:43:06,459 --> 01:43:09,541
and we'd all have been
better off.

1578
01:43:09,834 --> 01:43:13,458
- The cold heart indeed,
madame,

1579
01:43:13,750 --> 01:43:16,624
which deserves no mercy.

1580
01:43:30,875 --> 01:43:34,458
- Nasty business, wife turning
on her husband like that.

1581
01:43:34,750 --> 01:43:37,833
- Oui, but one good thing
has come from this, Hastings.

1582
01:43:38,125 --> 01:43:40,499
Wilhemina Lawson has made
a share-out among the family

1583
01:43:40,792 --> 01:43:42,541
of the fortune
of Emily Arundel.

1584
01:43:42,834 --> 01:43:44,583
- At least I could pay my bill
here.

1585
01:43:44,875 --> 01:43:45,833
- And now the world record,

1586
01:43:46,125 --> 01:43:47,249
it begs to be broken,
n'est-ce pas?

1587
01:43:47,542 --> 01:43:48,749
- Not by me.

1588
01:43:49,042 --> 01:43:51,208
I'm off to Bonneville.
It's in Utah.

1589
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:53,708
- Ah, but that is the desert,
I believe.

1590
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:55,916
There are no lakes.
- Quite.

1591
01:43:56,209 --> 01:43:58,124
Leave water speed
to Campbell and his cronies.

1592
01:43:58,417 --> 01:43:59,708
I am going for land speed
next time.

1593
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,583
- And we're going to London.
- Not yet, Hastings.

1594
01:44:02,875 --> 01:44:04,291
Not until a matter
of the most important,

1595
01:44:04,584 --> 01:44:06,374
it has been resolved.

1596
01:44:11,125 --> 01:44:12,708
- I was amazed,
wasn't I, Poirot?

1597
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:14,291
- Indeed so, mon ami.

1598
01:44:14,584 --> 01:44:15,749
- To think that
all these years,

1599
01:44:16,042 --> 01:44:18,249
Poirot had the gift
for reaching the other side.

1600
01:44:18,542 --> 01:44:21,833
- I said there were hidden
depths to you, Mr. Poirot.

1601
01:44:22,125 --> 01:44:23,833
- Then it happened again,
last night.

1602
01:44:24,125 --> 01:44:25,958
- Really?

1603
01:44:26,250 --> 01:44:27,708
Who came to you?

1604
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:31,458
- I woke up to find this--
how best to say this?

1605
01:44:31,750 --> 01:44:33,791
Presence in my room.

1606
01:44:34,084 --> 01:44:39,833
I looked up,
and I saw the springer spaniel.

1607
01:44:40,125 --> 01:44:43,541
- Albert?
- Oui.

1608
01:44:43,834 --> 01:44:45,291
- What did he say?

1609
01:44:49,584 --> 01:44:52,083
- He spoke to Bob, madame.

1610
01:44:52,375 --> 01:44:55,416
He said, "Go live with
my people.

1611
01:44:55,709 --> 01:44:59,791
They have of you
the great need."

1612
01:45:02,500 --> 01:45:04,166
- Then, of course, he must.

1613
01:45:04,459 --> 01:45:07,416
Are you sure you can manage
without him, though?

1614
01:45:07,709 --> 01:45:12,624
I mean, he was a great help
to you with this case.

1615
01:45:12,917 --> 01:45:16,124
- Oui.

1616
01:45:16,417 --> 01:45:18,833
It will not be easy,
but...

1617
01:45:21,834 --> 01:45:24,124
I shall try.
